WEBVTT

00:00.034 --> 00:02.867
Everybody had some idea of about
who I was, who they wanted me to be.

00:02.937 --> 00:04.928
They hear my voice on the
radio, they think they know me.

00:05.005 --> 00:05.994
They want to know you.

00:07.274 --> 00:08.832
We got the obscene phone caller.

00:08.909 --> 00:11.002
He's not your pervert.
He's a private eye.

00:11.078 --> 00:12.238
Do you have a request?

00:12.313 --> 00:13.678
See, Holly Fox.

00:13.747 --> 00:16.614
There's one way to find out.
Call the station and ask.

00:16.684 --> 00:17.878
$20 says you're wrong.

00:17.952 --> 00:20.250
Is she more like Cicely Tyson
or Chaka Khan?

00:20.321 --> 00:22.448
What difference does it make
what she looks like?

00:22.523 --> 00:23.922
<i>Get out of Hawaii.</i>

01:34.578 --> 01:36.375
<i>Good morning, Honolulu.</i>

01:36.447 --> 01:38.244
<i>I'm coming to you on KTDE.</i>

01:38.315 --> 01:41.716
<i>Rock and rolling with golden
oldies, 24 hours a day.</i>

01:42.053 --> 01:43.247
<i>Remember when?</i>

02:39.110 --> 02:41.578
<i>Interesting fact
about life, number 32...</i>

02:41.645 --> 02:43.510
<i>things are not always
what they seem.</i>

02:43.581 --> 02:46.778
<i>Take for instance the collection of
stuff I was carrying in the back.</i>

02:46.851 --> 02:49.911
<i>Looked at individually, it was
just lumber, nails, and paint.</i>

02:49.987 --> 02:52.251
<i>Put together
with just the right touches...</i>

02:52.323 --> 02:54.052
<i>it was going to be
a work of art.</i>

02:54.125 --> 02:55.524
<i>It was Robin Masters' idea.</i>

02:55.593 --> 02:56.890
<i>He had called me from Zurich...</i>

02:56.961 --> 02:58.792
<i>and told me to spare no expense.</i>

02:58.863 --> 03:01.559
<i>I couldn't decide if I was having
more fun planning the party...</i>

03:01.632 --> 03:04.897
<i>or watching Higgins try to
figure out what I was up to.</i>

03:04.969 --> 03:07.836
<i>Otis Redding's
Sitting on the Dock of the Bay.</i>

03:07.905 --> 03:09.304
<i>What a nice day for it too.</i>

03:09.373 --> 03:11.500
<i>It's 70 degrees
and clear in Honolulu.</i>

03:11.575 --> 03:13.907
<i>Nothing new about that or this
next tune for that matter.</i>

03:13.978 --> 03:16.173
<i>But I think we can all
relate to it. I know I can.</i>

03:16.247 --> 03:17.236
<i>Can you?</i>

04:01.659 --> 04:04.059
It's not Holly Fox.
Holly Fox has dark hair.

04:04.128 --> 04:06.426
Oh, man, now you see what
ignorance does to a guy.

04:06.497 --> 04:09.261
Never even seen the lady, trying
to tell me she got dark hair.

04:09.333 --> 04:11.426
She's a redhead, man.
A natural.

04:11.502 --> 04:12.730
How do you know, Griff?

04:12.803 --> 04:15.067
Griff's trying to pass
this off as Holly Fox.

04:15.139 --> 04:16.731
That's not Holly.
That's Ann Margret.

04:16.807 --> 04:18.570
Ann Margret! You ain't
the only guy to see...

04:18.642 --> 04:19.939
<i>Bob Hope's Christmas show,
you know.</i>

04:20.010 --> 04:21.307
This ain't Ann Margaret.

04:21.378 --> 04:22.902
No one else
has a smile like that.

04:22.980 --> 04:24.641
<i>Besides, Holly Fox
is a brunette.</i>

04:24.715 --> 04:25.704
See?

04:25.783 --> 04:27.751
Oh, man, I'm telling you-

04:27.818 --> 04:30.878
She's about six feet tall,
with legs up to here.

04:30.955 --> 04:33.651
You're crazy.
She's 5 foot 2.

04:34.124 --> 04:36.388
5 foot 2?
Where'd you hear that?

04:36.460 --> 04:38.087
I got it at very good authority.

04:38.162 --> 04:39.186
Oh, man.

04:39.263 --> 04:40.662
No, no, no.

04:40.864 --> 04:43.424
Only someone who's tall,
black and beautiful...

04:43.500 --> 04:45.331
would call themselves a fox.

04:45.402 --> 04:47.563
Oh, now, you dreaming
the wrong color, brother.

04:47.638 --> 04:50.129
Listen, you guys gotta
trust me here. This is her.

04:50.207 --> 04:51.196
Wait, wait. Just listen.

04:51.275 --> 04:53.038
<i>I can imagine
what it makes some guys...</i>

04:53.110 --> 04:54.134
<i>so hard to satisfy.</i>

04:54.211 --> 04:56.076
<i>Holly Fox, back here with you.</i>

04:56.146 --> 04:59.081
<i>Dedicating this next one
to PFC Michael Forest Hyman...</i>

04:59.149 --> 05:01.811
<i>in the fourth squad,
second platoon, Bravo company.</i>

05:01.885 --> 05:03.216
<i>Second of the Seventh...
Brunette.</i>

05:03.287 --> 05:04.345
<i>Short!
Black.</i>

05:04.421 --> 05:05.513
<i>Redhead.
Go get them guys.</i>

05:05.589 --> 05:07.022
Listen, guys,
they're telling you...

05:07.091 --> 05:10.652
that Holly Hudson on
KTDE is really Holly Fox.

05:10.728 --> 05:11.888
Not a chance.

05:11.962 --> 05:15.090
I heard Holly Fox married an
Air Force general after the war.

05:15.165 --> 05:16.860
What an Air Force
general's wife...

05:16.934 --> 05:19.095
be doing on an oldies-but-goodies
station out here?

05:19.169 --> 05:21.399
Well, maybe she got
divorced, or changed her name.

05:21.472 --> 05:22.996
Hey, he's got a point there.

05:23.607 --> 05:26.599
Unless a DJ changes his
image, he's yesterday's news.

05:27.044 --> 05:29.478
I knew this guy once,
on the mainland, DJ...

05:29.546 --> 05:32.174
he used to call himself,
"The Shah of Soul."

05:32.249 --> 05:34.615
Then we got in all
this trouble with Iran.

05:34.685 --> 05:37.085
Hey, maybe that's what
happened to Holly.

05:37.154 --> 05:39.782
Got tired of being called
the Saigon Fox.

05:39.857 --> 05:41.017
I never called her that.

05:41.091 --> 05:42.991
I used to call her
the queen of my dreams.

05:43.060 --> 05:44.789
Hey, don't overexert yourself.

05:44.862 --> 05:46.227
<i>I know that
one will always be...</i>

05:46.297 --> 05:47.559
Listen. Tell me
that isn't her.

05:47.631 --> 05:49.656
<i>Words like those just seem
to be timeless, don't they?</i>

05:49.733 --> 05:51.462
<i>That was dedicated
to a special friend...</i>

05:51.535 --> 05:53.366
<i>of my very own,
Mr. Don Cassidy...</i>

05:53.437 --> 05:55.302
<i>from Holly. Remember me?</i>

05:55.372 --> 05:56.930
<i>If you're out there
listening, Don...</i>

05:57.007 --> 05:59.441
<i>do like the lady says
and call me at the station.</i>

05:59.510 --> 06:01.375
<i>Coming up, the news.</i>

06:01.445 --> 06:03.310
See? Holly Fox.

06:03.414 --> 06:04.642
No. It can't be.

06:04.715 --> 06:07.047
Well, there's
one way to find out.

06:07.151 --> 06:08.846
Call the station and ask.

06:08.919 --> 06:10.978
$20 says you're wrong.
Even money.

06:11.188 --> 06:12.348
$20?

06:12.456 --> 06:14.014
Put your money
where your mouth is.

06:14.091 --> 06:15.991
Well, I'm a little tapped out
right now.

06:16.060 --> 06:17.391
Now there's a newsflash.

06:17.461 --> 06:20.259
What, with all
the party expenses and all?

06:20.831 --> 06:22.958
I'll tell you what. I'm
expecting a check from a client.

06:23.033 --> 06:24.364
If you can trust me,
you got a bet.

06:24.435 --> 06:25.424
Okay, you're on.

06:25.502 --> 06:27.402
Great.
I'm gonna call her.

06:27.571 --> 06:29.903
What kind of a sucker bet
is that?

06:29.973 --> 06:31.565
You're gonna trust him?

06:31.642 --> 06:33.007
Oh, he's good for it.

06:33.077 --> 06:36.478
When was the last time you heard
of him collecting from a client?

06:41.085 --> 06:43.417
Hey, Thomas! Wait!
Wait a minute.

06:44.988 --> 06:46.785
No, he's good for it.

07:09.079 --> 07:10.512
Hi, Higgins.

07:10.581 --> 07:12.481
You're looking chipper.

07:12.783 --> 07:13.943
Chipper?

07:14.251 --> 07:15.479
Chipper?

07:15.552 --> 07:18.885
This is how he describes the
countenance of a man in anguish.

07:18.956 --> 07:20.150
"Chipper."

07:20.224 --> 07:21.714
You're not feeling chipper?

07:21.792 --> 07:22.884
On the contrary...

07:22.960 --> 07:25.258
my cold's taken a decided turn
for the worse.

07:26.430 --> 07:27.988
What is it
that you're looking for?

07:28.065 --> 07:29.123
Phone number.

07:29.199 --> 07:30.928
There are at least 11
telephones in this house.

07:31.001 --> 07:32.901
Why must you come in here
to make a call?

07:33.570 --> 07:36.801
<i>You know, maybe you should take some
sun. That might fix you right up. Busy.</i>

07:36.874 --> 07:37.898
Sun?

07:37.975 --> 07:39.704
Yeah. You know,
look better, feel better.

07:39.777 --> 07:42.678
50%% of all illnesses
are psychosomatic.

07:42.746 --> 07:44.304
How reassuring.

07:44.381 --> 07:46.508
When I want your medical
diagnosis, I'll ask for it...

07:46.583 --> 07:48.141
and I assure you,
that won't happen.

07:48.652 --> 07:50.813
Gee, Higgins, I've never
seen you like this before.

07:50.888 --> 07:52.412
You've been moping around
for days.

07:52.489 --> 07:54.480
What happened
to that old stiff upper lip?

07:54.558 --> 07:56.685
Stiff upper lip? How am I
to keep a stiff upper lip...

07:56.760 --> 07:59.627
when my own employer has demonstrated
that he has lost all faith...

07:59.696 --> 08:01.061
in my administrative abilities?

08:01.131 --> 08:02.291
What are you talking about?

08:02.366 --> 08:04.926
For some reason, Mr. Masters
seems unwilling to divulge to me...

08:05.002 --> 08:06.993
the nature of that monstrosity
you're constructing-

08:07.070 --> 08:08.970
Monstrosity?
It happens to be-

08:09.039 --> 08:11.007
Obviously, he no longer
trusts my judgment...

08:11.074 --> 08:13.304
in matters pertaining
to the running of the estate.

08:15.946 --> 08:17.345
Oh, Higgins.

08:18.215 --> 08:21.116
You don't really
have a cold at all, do you?

08:21.251 --> 08:23.082
You're feeling left out.

08:23.220 --> 08:24.847
Left out.

08:24.922 --> 08:26.116
Hardly.

08:26.723 --> 08:27.815
Okay.

08:30.260 --> 08:32.159
If you really must know...

08:32.996 --> 08:35.294
I'll tell you what I'm building.

08:37.167 --> 08:38.998
Just as soon
as I've finished it.

08:39.770 --> 08:41.828
<i>But now, I've got to go
on a personal mission.</i>

08:41.905 --> 08:44.135
Can I pick anything up for you?

08:48.946 --> 08:50.038
Thank you.

08:50.113 --> 08:51.808
Throat spray atomizer,
six ounce.

08:51.882 --> 08:53.372
Two tins cold lozenges.

08:53.851 --> 08:56.115
Tins? Two tins?

08:56.186 --> 08:59.519
Mrs. Cywanowitz's canned chicken
soup, 12 ounces, six limes...

08:59.590 --> 09:01.820
honey, tea,
three bottles rose water...

09:01.925 --> 09:05.088
one bottle cognac, pop up
tissues, nasal decongestant...

09:05.162 --> 09:08.598
one large tin uncle size
sweetened succotash?

09:09.166 --> 09:10.565
Succotash, Higgins?

09:34.157 --> 09:35.590
Mr. Magnum!

09:35.959 --> 09:37.756
Long time no see.

09:39.162 --> 09:41.630
Since I let you break into that
computer place I was guarding.

09:41.698 --> 09:42.722
Chinese New Year's.

09:42.799 --> 09:44.391
I'm surprised
to see you here, Ralph.

09:44.468 --> 09:46.493
Oh, I've been working here
a couple of months.

09:46.570 --> 09:48.970
You here about Holly Hudson?

09:49.039 --> 09:50.563
Yeah. I am.

09:50.641 --> 09:51.630
Shame, isn't it?

09:51.708 --> 09:53.733
Nice lady like that shouldn't
have to be subjected...

09:53.810 --> 09:56.335
to some sicko calling in,
threatening her.

09:56.413 --> 09:58.711
<i>But you'll catch him,
Mr. Magnum. I know you will.</i>

09:59.550 --> 10:01.142
Oh, yeah. Well...

10:01.218 --> 10:02.879
Meantime, I'm here to see...

10:02.953 --> 10:05.513
no one gets through that door
doesn't have business here.

10:05.589 --> 10:07.750
Great. Keep up
the good work, Ralph.

10:34.985 --> 10:36.111
Hi.

10:36.720 --> 10:37.778
Yes?

10:38.088 --> 10:39.180
Oh...

10:40.324 --> 10:42.189
I just wanted to say hello.

10:43.594 --> 10:44.788
Hello.

10:44.861 --> 10:48.353
You know what, I mean,
I drove up here to meet you.

10:49.166 --> 10:50.531
I tried calling.

10:51.001 --> 10:52.093
You called?

10:52.169 --> 10:54.160
Yeah, after I heard you
on the radio.

10:55.038 --> 10:56.369
I'm sorry.

10:56.740 --> 10:58.298
I'm Thomas Magnum.

10:59.643 --> 11:01.167
And you're Holly Fox.

11:02.145 --> 11:04.136
<i>Benny, get Ralph in here.</i>

11:04.214 --> 11:07.342
<i>I mean, of course,
you're Holly Hudson. But...</i>

11:08.452 --> 11:10.784
I remembered you as Holly Fox...

11:10.854 --> 11:12.481
in Nam. On the radio.

11:12.556 --> 11:15.423
<i>Benny, the guy who's been
calling Holly is here.</i>

11:15.492 --> 11:17.517
You're not Holly?
No, don't come near me!

11:17.594 --> 11:18.788
Don't move.

11:19.630 --> 11:21.495
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

11:21.865 --> 11:23.560
All right, sleazo,
hold it right there.

11:23.634 --> 11:25.499
Don't try anything funny.
Security's on its way.

11:25.569 --> 11:26.593
No.
You don't understand.

11:26.670 --> 11:29.070
No, I understand you were making
phone calls to the station.

11:29.139 --> 11:30.401
No, not those phone calls.

11:30.474 --> 11:32.965
<i>I don't see how he could've
got past me, Mr. Bryant.</i>

11:33.043 --> 11:34.476
We got the obscene phone caller.

11:34.544 --> 11:37.445
No, you don't. You got the wrong
guy. Ralph, will you explain?

11:37.514 --> 11:39.209
<i>You got the wrong guy here,
Mr. Bryant.</i>

11:39.282 --> 11:41.910
He's not your pervert.
He's a private eye.

11:41.985 --> 11:43.111
Investigator.

11:43.186 --> 11:44.517
<i>Yeah? Yeah.</i>

11:44.588 --> 11:46.488
<i>This here's Mr. Bryant,
the station manager.</i>

11:46.556 --> 11:48.490
Hey, I thought
you was working for him.

11:48.558 --> 11:51.288
Sorry, no. I'm looking
for Holly Hudson.

11:51.695 --> 11:53.492
Forget it, she's not
seeing anybody.

11:53.563 --> 11:54.996
<i>I'll handle this, Benny.</i>

11:56.533 --> 11:57.795
You sure?

11:59.903 --> 12:00.995
Okay.

12:01.204 --> 12:02.535
I'm sorry.

12:05.208 --> 12:07.176
Sorry about
the misunderstanding.

12:07.244 --> 12:08.575
Come on in.

12:13.850 --> 12:16.250
<i>Benny's been getting a little
worried about me lately.</i>

12:16.319 --> 12:18.810
I've been getting some
pretty freaky phone calls.

12:20.190 --> 12:22.055
You mean you're...
Here it comes.

12:22.125 --> 12:23.854
No, you're not.

12:23.927 --> 12:25.019
Right on schedule.

12:25.095 --> 12:26.255
You're Holly Fox?

12:26.329 --> 12:27.956
And there it is. That look.

12:28.031 --> 12:29.089
What look?

12:30.534 --> 12:31.762
That look.

12:31.835 --> 12:34.065
The look that's on your face right now.

12:34.137 --> 12:38.164
The look I stopped counting
about the 1000th time I saw it.

12:38.241 --> 12:39.333
The look that says...

12:39.409 --> 12:42.867
"Hey, lady,
you can't be Holly Fox."

12:42.946 --> 12:46.177
"Holly Fox takes your
breath away. She's an angel."

12:46.249 --> 12:47.546
"A tiger..."

12:47.617 --> 12:49.710
"a geisha girl,
a centerfold."

12:50.787 --> 12:52.049
Did I leave out your fantasy?

12:52.122 --> 12:54.613
No. I mean, I didn't have one.

12:54.691 --> 12:56.318
I'm sure you did.

12:56.760 --> 12:58.057
Everyone does.

12:58.662 --> 12:59.890
Would you like some coffee?

12:59.963 --> 13:01.328
No, thanks.

13:01.631 --> 13:04.156
Everyone is looking
for the provocative...

13:04.234 --> 13:05.792
alluring, appealing...

13:05.869 --> 13:08.667
unbelievable Nighttime Edition
of Holly Fox.

13:08.739 --> 13:10.434
I'm the Morning Edition.

13:10.841 --> 13:13.173
I've also gone back
to my real name Holly Hudson.

13:13.243 --> 13:14.733
Thomas Magnum.

13:15.245 --> 13:18.009
And I think the Morning
Edition is just terrific...

13:18.081 --> 13:19.207
as is.

13:21.752 --> 13:23.982
Listen, is there anything
I can do...

13:24.054 --> 13:26.852
to help you find this guy
who's been calling in?

13:27.357 --> 13:30.417
Oh, you can't take crank
phone calls too seriously.

13:30.494 --> 13:32.519
Sort of comes with the
territory. No big deal.

13:32.596 --> 13:33.927
Well...

13:35.065 --> 13:36.430
It's nice meeting you.

13:41.638 --> 13:43.037
Wait a minute.

13:43.106 --> 13:45.301
Maybe there is something
you could help me with.

13:45.976 --> 13:48.672
There is somebody I've been
looking for for a long time.

13:52.215 --> 13:53.580
Don Cassidy.

13:55.085 --> 13:57.178
Saigon. '71.

13:57.721 --> 13:59.154
He was an Army Supply Sergeant.

13:59.222 --> 14:02.089
Just after that picture was
taken, he dropped out of sight.

14:02.492 --> 14:06.053
Well, Army Supply sergeants
don't just drop out of sight.

14:06.630 --> 14:08.393
Did he see action?
Maybe he got hurt.

14:08.465 --> 14:10.296
Not a scratch. He ran a depot.

14:12.335 --> 14:13.768
We were in love, you know.

14:13.837 --> 14:15.998
We were going to be married
before the end of the war.

14:16.072 --> 14:18.199
And then he got in trouble
with the Army.

14:19.509 --> 14:21.909
He told me he was gonna
drop out of sight...

14:21.978 --> 14:23.309
just until his name got cleared.

14:23.380 --> 14:24.404
Of what?

14:24.481 --> 14:26.005
Army said he stole things.

14:26.082 --> 14:28.175
He didn't. He was set up.

14:30.687 --> 14:32.450
It was 12 years ago.

14:34.324 --> 14:36.121
I've been looking for him
ever since.

14:36.927 --> 14:38.224
Can I keep this?

14:38.295 --> 14:39.319
Sure.

14:39.396 --> 14:41.125
I got another copy.

14:41.798 --> 14:43.288
Excuse me.
What?

14:43.366 --> 14:45.561
Excuse me.
Oh! I'm sorry.

14:47.470 --> 14:50.496
Well, she may not be
there, but you'll always have me.

14:51.474 --> 14:53.169
Holly Hudson
back here with you...

14:53.243 --> 14:54.904
and I'd like to dedicate
this next one to...

14:56.079 --> 14:57.603
old friends...

14:58.048 --> 14:59.140
who've just met.

15:04.120 --> 15:06.384
This is great!
Oh, just a minute.

15:06.456 --> 15:07.787
It's okay.

15:08.024 --> 15:09.821
Everything is prerecorded.

15:09.893 --> 15:11.360
We don't do much live anymore.

15:11.428 --> 15:12.417
Oh.

15:12.762 --> 15:14.889
Listen, what makes you think
he's in Hawaii?

15:14.965 --> 15:17.399
A good friend of mine,
Joanie Mead, said she saw him.

15:18.101 --> 15:19.466
She's a travel agent.

15:24.574 --> 15:26.599
KTDE, would you like
to make a request?

15:26.676 --> 15:28.610
<i>Get off the air.</i>

15:31.514 --> 15:32.538
I beg your pardon?

15:32.616 --> 15:36.450
<i>Unless you wanna find out how hard it
is to broadcast with your throat cut...</i>

15:36.519 --> 15:38.077
<i>get out of Hawaii.</i>

15:51.584 --> 15:53.575
<i>Being threatened
on the telephone...</i>

15:53.653 --> 15:56.247
<i>is kind of like being attacked
in the middle of the night.</i>

15:56.322 --> 15:58.722
<i>It's all the more frightening
because you can't see your enemy.</i>

15:58.791 --> 16:00.656
<i>But Holly insisted
the caller was harmless.</i>

16:00.726 --> 16:02.751
<i>Her only concern
was finding Cassidy.</i>

16:02.829 --> 16:04.126
<i>I told her I'd do what I could.</i>

16:04.197 --> 16:06.631
<i>But first, I had to find a way
to convince Rick and T.C...</i>

16:06.699 --> 16:08.826
<i>to finish Higgins' surprise
without me.</i>

16:08.901 --> 16:10.129
Hi, Higgins.

16:12.839 --> 16:14.807
Glad to see you took my advice.

16:14.874 --> 16:16.603
Which advice was that?

16:16.676 --> 16:19.201
To get some sun. You're
looking much better already.

16:19.278 --> 16:20.575
Am I?

16:21.180 --> 16:23.045
How cruel fate can be.

16:23.516 --> 16:25.450
Just when a man
is at his lowest ebb...

16:25.518 --> 16:27.349
to give others
the deceitful appearance...

16:27.420 --> 16:29.251
that he's returning
to the pink of health.

16:29.322 --> 16:31.813
Come on, Higgins. You're laying
it on a little thick, aren't you?

16:31.891 --> 16:33.586
I mean, it's just a cold.

16:33.659 --> 16:36.150
Indeed. Just a cold.

16:39.265 --> 16:41.790
I got the things you asked me
to pick up for you.

16:43.102 --> 16:44.899
I even got succotash.

16:44.971 --> 16:46.871
Do you have any idea
how hard it is to find...

16:46.939 --> 16:49.407
tins of sweetened succotash
these days?

16:49.475 --> 16:52.239
Thank you, Magnum. That
really is most kind of you...

16:52.311 --> 16:55.371
even though it is probably
too little too late.

16:56.415 --> 16:58.747
I hope
you're feeling better soon.

16:58.818 --> 17:00.308
I say, Magnum?

17:00.653 --> 17:03.520
This edifice
you're constructing, the...

17:04.857 --> 17:06.586
What did you call it again?

17:08.327 --> 17:09.589
I didn't.

17:09.662 --> 17:10.821
Quite.

17:12.632 --> 17:14.122
Say, Magnum...

17:14.567 --> 17:16.558
I merely wanted to tell you...

17:16.636 --> 17:20.196
not to, under any circumstances,
feel any guilt or remorse...

17:20.272 --> 17:21.830
over blocking the view.

17:21.907 --> 17:22.965
All right.

17:23.041 --> 17:24.599
Nor should it concern you...

17:24.676 --> 17:26.872
that in my already
weakened state...

17:26.945 --> 17:29.915
I am unable to get the rest
I so desperately need...

17:29.982 --> 17:31.779
due to the sound
of construction.

17:31.851 --> 17:32.977
Good.

17:33.819 --> 17:35.116
Anything else?

17:35.421 --> 17:36.820
Not for the moment.

17:38.724 --> 17:39.952
A clue.

17:43.596 --> 17:44.995
It's a kind of...

17:46.165 --> 17:47.655
commemorative.

17:52.271 --> 17:53.761
Commemorative.

17:56.709 --> 17:57.801
Hi, guys.

17:57.877 --> 17:59.435
It's about time
you showed up, Thomas.

17:59.512 --> 18:01.412
Higgins has been badgering
us ever since you left.

18:01.480 --> 18:04.916
<i>Yeah. But not to worry,
Thomas. We did not crack.</i>

18:04.984 --> 18:06.451
Well, what do you think?

18:07.053 --> 18:10.181
What can I tell you, guys? You're really
doing a terrific job here. Really.

18:10.256 --> 18:12.383
Oh, yeah. That's enough
about the lumber for a minute.

18:12.458 --> 18:14.323
And I wish I could
stay here and help you finish.

18:14.393 --> 18:15.382
Did you see her?

18:16.529 --> 18:18.690
I told you my $20 was safe.
It wasn't her, was it?

18:18.764 --> 18:21.358
Wait a minute. What do you
mean, you wish you could stay?

18:21.434 --> 18:23.368
You're not trying to run
out on us again, are you?

18:23.436 --> 18:25.404
I'm sorry,
but a big case has come up.

18:25.471 --> 18:27.632
I wouldn't leave you here
unless it was real important.

18:27.707 --> 18:29.197
What big case?

18:29.275 --> 18:30.503
What about Holly?

18:30.576 --> 18:32.908
Holly?
Yes, Holly Fox...

18:32.979 --> 18:35.038
a. K.a. Holly Hudson?

18:35.114 --> 18:36.809
Oh, that Holly?

18:37.283 --> 18:38.875
Well, I'm bringing her
by here...

18:38.951 --> 18:41.010
to meet you two at 4:00.

18:41.087 --> 18:43.419
See, I figure you'll be
through here by then.

18:43.723 --> 18:45.020
You met Holly Fox?

18:45.091 --> 18:46.149
Yeah, what's she like?

18:46.225 --> 18:48.716
It's real important
that you finish here today.

18:48.794 --> 18:50.056
She isn't tall, is she?

18:50.129 --> 18:52.324
<i>Because the guys
from Scale Models Unlimited...</i>

18:52.398 --> 18:53.660
are coming here in the morning.

18:53.733 --> 18:56.031
Is she look more like
Cicely Tyson or Chaka Khan?

18:56.102 --> 18:58.002
What difference does it make
what she looks like?

18:58.070 --> 19:01.301
If she's tall or short,
or blonde or...

19:01.374 --> 19:03.808
Look, she's an attractive,
funny...

19:04.010 --> 19:05.534
interesting woman.

19:05.611 --> 19:07.841
And she's really down to earth.

19:08.147 --> 19:09.444
And she's in love.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.141
With you, I suppose.

19:13.219 --> 19:15.210
No. With some guy
she knew in Nam...

19:15.287 --> 19:16.481
and she asked me...

19:16.555 --> 19:18.819
to help her find him.
That'll be $20, please.

19:19.825 --> 19:22.123
You're working for Holly Fox?

19:22.428 --> 19:23.486
The one and only.

19:24.664 --> 19:25.858
Well...

19:25.931 --> 19:27.330
if you're doing something
for Holly...

19:27.400 --> 19:29.163
I guess
we'll finish up here for you.

19:31.170 --> 19:33.263
Oh, yeah, yeah. Sure, sure.
Go on.

19:33.339 --> 19:34.897
Thanks, guys.
I knew you'd understand.

19:34.974 --> 19:37.204
I gotta go see a lady
about a snapshot.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.374
Who is Chaka Khan?

19:43.382 --> 19:44.610
Hey...

19:44.684 --> 19:46.982
did he say we're supposed to
meet Holly Fox in three hours?

19:47.053 --> 19:48.577
That's what he said.

19:49.955 --> 19:51.286
Dressed like this?

19:54.827 --> 19:56.886
Whoa, wait a minute.
Where're you going?

19:56.962 --> 19:58.224
To get cleaned up.

19:58.297 --> 20:00.094
We're supposed to finish this.

20:00.166 --> 20:01.463
You finish it.

20:03.736 --> 20:05.704
Hey! Wait for me!

20:09.041 --> 20:11.009
That's with the 40%% discount.

20:11.844 --> 20:14.574
<i>Well, I'll see
what I can do. Bye.</i>

20:15.347 --> 20:17.338
I'm sorry. Where were we?

20:18.150 --> 20:19.208
Oh, yeah.

20:19.285 --> 20:21.480
I'd stopped at the market
on my way home from work.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.579
I always stop at the market
on my way home from work.

20:23.656 --> 20:24.714
And Cassidy was there?

20:26.225 --> 20:27.385
Akana Travel.

20:28.627 --> 20:30.822
Uh-huh. I practically
walked right into him.

20:31.197 --> 20:33.757
Yeah, but our package
has a genuine Hawaiian luau.

20:33.833 --> 20:36.563
Are you sure? I mean, people
can change a lot in 10 years.

20:36.635 --> 20:39.433
Are you kidding? That
face is etched in my brain.

20:40.072 --> 20:41.596
I can throw in
two free Chi Chi's...

20:41.674 --> 20:43.665
and an authentic shell
and seed lei.

20:44.009 --> 20:46.000
When I called out his name,
he took off like a shot.

20:46.078 --> 20:47.841
Like I was the police
or something.

20:48.547 --> 20:50.674
I think you'll be
very disappointed with the-

20:51.250 --> 20:52.774
Hello? Hello?

20:54.420 --> 20:55.478
They hung up.

20:56.622 --> 20:57.611
Wait.

20:58.524 --> 21:00.788
Did you see a car,
license number?

21:01.026 --> 21:02.425
Nope. Sorry.

21:04.997 --> 21:06.191
Thanks.

21:06.699 --> 21:07.996
Akana Travel.

21:08.334 --> 21:09.392
One moment.

21:09.468 --> 21:11.561
You sure I can't sell you
that tour to Singapore?

21:11.637 --> 21:13.036
I'll get you discount.

21:13.839 --> 21:16.273
No, thanks.
Maybe some other time.

21:17.009 --> 21:19.409
Hello? Dinner cruises?

21:20.179 --> 21:22.147
<i>Holly, where are you going?</i>

21:22.214 --> 21:24.512
This is not a smart move,
Holly. This is crazy.

21:24.583 --> 21:26.608
If you stick around, I'm
gonna need you for some promos.

21:26.685 --> 21:27.879
You stick around here.

21:27.953 --> 21:31.150
Don't run off like this. It could be
that crazy who's calling you, you know.

21:31.223 --> 21:32.713
Ralph, will you stop her?

21:32.792 --> 21:34.657
Does this thing run?
Will you get her?

21:34.860 --> 21:35.849
Will you-

21:40.733 --> 21:42.792
Where's Holly going? I was
supposed to meet her here.

21:42.868 --> 21:44.631
I don't know.
She just came running out.

21:44.703 --> 21:47.263
I told her not to go.
She got some phone call.

21:47.339 --> 21:49.136
Claimed he was a friend
of Don Cassidy's.

21:49.208 --> 21:51.733
So, she jumps up and
runs off to meet him.

21:51.811 --> 21:54.143
<i>But does she
listen to me? No!</i>

22:04.990 --> 22:06.821
<i>When I was very
young, my mom and I...</i>

22:06.892 --> 22:09.053
<i>moved away
from Tidewater, Virginia.</i>

22:09.361 --> 22:12.091
<i>And I always carried the memory
of that small town with me...</i>

22:12.164 --> 22:14.724
<i>exactly as it was
the day we left.</i>

22:14.800 --> 22:17.325
<i>Whenever I was feeling
scared or lonely...</i>

22:17.636 --> 22:20.469
<i>I'd remember Tidewater
and happier days.</i>

22:20.906 --> 22:23.898
<i>When I finally went back
to visit, many years later...</i>

22:23.976 --> 22:26.376
<i>I couldn't find the town
I'd remembered.</i>

22:27.046 --> 22:30.277
<i>I finally realized
the town had grown up, too.</i>

22:34.954 --> 22:38.583
<i>It was hard to let go of the image
I carried around for so long.</i>

22:39.525 --> 22:42.824
<i>I wondered if Holly was doing
the same thing with Don Cassidy.</i>

22:43.062 --> 22:44.495
<i>I hope not.</i>

23:01.614 --> 23:02.603
No!

23:11.190 --> 23:12.214
No!

23:12.291 --> 23:13.690
No, no!

23:16.862 --> 23:17.920
No.

23:21.000 --> 23:22.126
No!

23:48.894 --> 23:52.022
Stay out of this!
I'm on a mission from God.

24:00.572 --> 24:02.369
She's the one you ought
to be taking away!

24:02.440 --> 24:04.499
Hypnotizing people
with that voice of hers.

24:04.576 --> 24:07.136
Sending out secret messages
over the radio.

24:07.245 --> 24:09.440
Seducing people
to do the work of the devil.

24:09.514 --> 24:10.640
You'll burn, lady!

24:10.715 --> 24:12.842
Do you hear me?
You'll burn!

24:16.387 --> 24:18.446
You okay?
Yeah, sure, terrific!

24:18.756 --> 24:21.657
Some guy tries to run me down because
he thinks I'm somebody I'm not.

24:23.461 --> 24:25.190
When does all this stop?

24:25.263 --> 24:27.128
I don't think
he'll bother you again.

24:27.198 --> 24:28.358
Great.

24:28.466 --> 24:30.696
One down, how many left to go?

24:32.103 --> 24:34.731
It's always been like this.
Even in Nam.

24:34.806 --> 24:36.637
Everybody had some idea
about who I was...

24:36.708 --> 24:38.198
who they wanted me to be.

24:38.409 --> 24:40.639
They hear my voice on the
radio, they think they know me.

24:40.712 --> 24:41.804
They want to know you.

24:41.880 --> 24:43.541
No, they don't. No.

24:46.084 --> 24:47.449
They don't.

24:49.120 --> 24:52.317
They don't wanna know me,
Holly Hudson.

24:53.691 --> 24:56.421
They want to know
some larger than life fantasy.

24:57.662 --> 24:59.562
Kind of goes with the territory?

25:00.431 --> 25:01.523
Yeah.

25:02.567 --> 25:04.296
Well, I'm changing territories.

25:05.703 --> 25:07.295
I'm gonna find Don...

25:07.672 --> 25:10.140
and we're gonna get married
just like we planned.

25:11.843 --> 25:14.311
And then I'm hanging up
my microphone for good.

25:18.216 --> 25:20.810
You can help me find him,
can't you, Thomas?

25:24.155 --> 25:26.419
I didn't think you
were gonna get that dressed up.

25:26.491 --> 25:28.391
Who's "that dressed up"?

25:29.127 --> 25:32.494
I might've known you'd pull something
like this just to ace me out with Holly.

25:32.830 --> 25:34.320
Can I help it if I just...

25:34.399 --> 25:38.426
naturally exude charm
and sex appeal?

25:38.937 --> 25:41.531
Well, I'd appreciate it if
you'd exude someplace else.

25:41.606 --> 25:43.574
I've been waiting 12 years
to meet Holly Fox.

25:43.641 --> 25:45.632
I brought this food here
just to impress her...

25:45.710 --> 25:47.541
and I don't need you here
to mess it up.

25:47.612 --> 25:49.136
Hey, I've been waiting
to meet her, too.

25:49.213 --> 25:52.478
So, unless you're going to
personally escort me to the door...

25:52.550 --> 25:54.108
I am staying.

25:54.185 --> 25:55.243
Oh, yeah?

25:55.320 --> 25:56.446
Yeah.

25:57.689 --> 26:00.385
Yeah, well, that's just fine.
Then stay.

26:00.658 --> 26:03.718
You know, women are interested
in more than just flashy clothes.

26:03.795 --> 26:07.060
A woman of Holly's caliber is interested
in meeting a man that she can talk to.

26:07.131 --> 26:08.826
Oh, and that's you?
You're darn right it is.

26:08.900 --> 26:10.162
When she walks
through that door...

26:10.234 --> 26:12.099
and I turn on the old
Orville Wright charm...

26:12.170 --> 26:14.195
she ain't going to know
you exist.

26:14.806 --> 26:16.205
Hi, guys.

26:16.708 --> 26:18.107
Rick, T.C...

26:18.376 --> 26:20.173
I would like you
to meet Holly Hudson...

26:20.244 --> 26:22.007
known to you formerly
in another time...

26:22.080 --> 26:24.913
and in another place
as Holly Fox.

26:32.790 --> 26:35.350
This is a rare opportunity
for you, Thomas.

26:35.426 --> 26:38.884
Few men have been able to
witness "The Look" firsthand.

26:40.498 --> 26:43.695
I'm actually standing here
talking to Holly Fox.

26:43.968 --> 26:46.095
That's me.
The living legend.

26:46.437 --> 26:47.802
Oh, I'm...

26:48.039 --> 26:50.906
I am-I mean, you, we...

26:50.975 --> 26:54.172
This is an example of the
old Orville Wright charm?

26:57.782 --> 26:59.716
May we offer you
a drink or something?

27:06.224 --> 27:07.623
So when he gets to my place...

27:08.760 --> 27:11.524
This is Don's idea,
all the lights are out...

27:11.596 --> 27:13.621
and this kid
saunters across the room...

27:13.698 --> 27:14.960
to where he thinks
I'm sitting...

27:15.033 --> 27:16.193
and he says...

27:16.267 --> 27:17.825
"Hi, baby."

27:17.902 --> 27:20.769
And then Don whips off the wig
and says in his best falsetto...

27:20.838 --> 27:22.032
"Hi, sailor."

27:23.207 --> 27:25.801
That kid ran all the way
back to his company.

27:26.044 --> 27:28.274
I wish I could've been there
to see his face.

27:28.346 --> 27:31.838
I can tell you, that kid never again
said that he was Holly Fox's boyfriend.

27:31.916 --> 27:35.374
Yeah, but everybody wanted
to be Holly Fox's boyfriend.

27:35.853 --> 27:37.184
You didn't marry the general...

27:37.255 --> 27:38.916
or run off
with the Secretary of State?

27:38.990 --> 27:42.426
Secretary of State.
I haven't heard that one.

27:43.294 --> 27:44.761
<i>But what did you do?</i>

27:44.829 --> 27:45.989
After the war?

27:46.631 --> 27:47.723
What do you mean?

27:47.799 --> 27:49.426
I guess everybody
was wondering...

27:49.500 --> 27:52.799
whatever happened to the lady
with the foxy voice.

27:56.174 --> 27:58.233
I've been looking for Don.

27:58.309 --> 27:59.469
All this time?

28:01.946 --> 28:04.471
Did I tell you about
when he proposed to me?

28:06.484 --> 28:10.045
It was in a little boat
on the Saigon river.

28:10.521 --> 28:12.716
Saigon was like Venice then.

28:13.157 --> 28:14.351
Venice?

28:14.425 --> 28:15.892
It was to me.

28:19.397 --> 28:22.059
I don't know how he could ever
let someone like you get away.

28:22.133 --> 28:23.725
Fortunes of war.

28:25.269 --> 28:26.998
<i>But I'm gonna find him again.</i>

28:27.939 --> 28:29.201
Somehow.

28:29.574 --> 28:31.201
And when I do...

28:31.709 --> 28:33.700
we're never gonna be
apart again.

28:34.112 --> 28:36.876
We're gonna be married on
Kaheo Point, if I have my way.

28:36.948 --> 28:38.006
Wow.

28:41.185 --> 28:46.919
K- T-D - E, KTDE. Honolulu

29:15.753 --> 29:17.015
You okay, Miss Hudson?

29:17.088 --> 29:19.079
Oh, sure, Ralph.
I'm fine.

29:19.590 --> 29:21.785
Well, if you need anything,
I'm right outside.

29:21.859 --> 29:22.848
Thank you.

29:32.403 --> 29:34.598
KTDE, would you like
to make a request?

29:34.672 --> 29:36.799
<i>You just don't listen, do you?</i>

29:37.441 --> 29:39.170
<i>I told you-</i>

29:39.243 --> 29:41.575
Don, I know it's you.

29:43.047 --> 29:44.537
Don't hang up.

29:47.351 --> 29:49.683
I just want to talk.

29:49.754 --> 29:51.221
No! No, wait.

29:52.223 --> 29:54.521
Just let me get my breath, okay.

29:56.694 --> 29:58.889
<i>I'd had the uncomfortable
feeling all morning...</i>

29:58.963 --> 30:02.922
<i>that the picture Holly was painting
of her time in Vietnam was distorted.</i>

30:03.334 --> 30:05.529
<i>I knew she still wanted me
to find Cassidy...</i>

30:05.603 --> 30:07.161
<i>and I knew I was
still going to try...</i>

30:07.238 --> 30:11.868
<i>but I was beginning to be a little
nervous about what or who...</i>

30:11.943 --> 30:13.706
<i>I was going to find.</i>

30:13.844 --> 30:15.573
Magnum.

30:18.649 --> 30:19.638
Higgins...

30:19.750 --> 30:22.583
don't ever sneak up
on somebody like that, ever.

30:22.853 --> 30:24.753
I was hardly sneaking.

30:25.556 --> 30:26.716
Okay.

30:26.791 --> 30:28.782
You haven't seen Rick or T.C.,
have you?

30:30.094 --> 30:32.927
No, you wouldn't, of course.
I mean, why would you?

30:32.997 --> 30:35.329
They were supposed
to help me finish this.

30:36.200 --> 30:37.360
Never mind.

30:37.835 --> 30:39.097
Do you want something?

30:39.170 --> 30:40.228
No.

30:52.283 --> 30:54.945
Higgins, I can't work
with you staring at me.

30:55.019 --> 30:56.850
Well, I certainly
wouldn't want to interfere...

30:56.921 --> 30:58.980
with your flow
of creative energy.

30:59.056 --> 31:01.752
I merely wish to inform you that
there is no longer any reason...

31:01.826 --> 31:03.885
to be secretive about your task.

31:04.328 --> 31:05.693
I know what it is you're doing.

31:05.763 --> 31:06.752
You do?

31:06.831 --> 31:10.062
It's quite clear, actually. I'm
surprised I couldn't see it before.

31:10.134 --> 31:11.533
Obviously...

31:11.736 --> 31:14.500
<i>this is a recreation
of the Irrawaddy Bridge.</i>

31:17.275 --> 31:19.243
The commemorative clue
should have been enough.

31:19.310 --> 31:21.505
It must have been the cold
which muddled my perceptions...

31:21.579 --> 31:23.843
to the point that I couldn't
make out the resemblance.

31:23.914 --> 31:26.405
I knew only that
it had a familiar look.

31:26.517 --> 31:28.917
Then I found this book
in your quarters.

31:29.487 --> 31:31.114
<i>Compendium of Facts.</i>

31:31.188 --> 31:32.883
You were snooping around
my place?

31:32.957 --> 31:34.857
Hardly. I was merely
looking for the vaporizer...

31:34.925 --> 31:36.984
you neglected to return
last winter.

31:37.061 --> 31:40.224
In any case, this book
was sitting in plain view.

31:40.431 --> 31:43.025
Suddenly it all fell into place.

31:43.801 --> 31:47.635
<i>Today is the anniversary of the
assault on the Irrawaddy Bridge.</i>

31:47.705 --> 31:51.106
Clearly, Mr. Masters is planning some
sort of reenactment of that event.

31:51.175 --> 31:52.642
Yeah. Well...

31:53.044 --> 31:54.909
I guess it would be foolish...

31:54.979 --> 31:58.107
to think that we could ever try
and keep a secret from you, Higgins.

31:58.182 --> 31:59.672
It was called
Operation Neville...

31:59.750 --> 32:01.342
after our commanding officer.

32:01.419 --> 32:02.909
And it would have
been successful, too...

32:02.987 --> 32:04.852
if our unit hadn't been
up most of the night...

32:04.922 --> 32:07.891
<i>drinking a concoction
called Bullfight Brandy.</i>

32:07.958 --> 32:11.291
A potent substance that rendered
anyone who drank it virtually...

32:11.362 --> 32:13.956
uncontrollable for 48 hours.

32:14.031 --> 32:15.658
The formula...

32:20.271 --> 32:21.295
No.

32:21.972 --> 32:24.497
No, no, no, no.

32:24.809 --> 32:25.969
No.

32:29.613 --> 32:31.046
Is that your final word?

32:32.249 --> 32:33.341
Yes.

32:34.051 --> 32:36.417
Now you can go back
and tell Magnum...

32:36.487 --> 32:38.421
that he can get
his information elsewhere.

32:38.489 --> 32:41.117
Hold on. He doesn't
even know I'm here.

32:41.425 --> 32:42.483
Oh.

32:44.862 --> 32:47.695
I'm sorry, T.C.,
I just can't do it.

32:49.934 --> 32:51.196
I understand.

32:51.602 --> 32:52.694
Good.

32:53.971 --> 32:55.962
T.C., why are you
in your flight suit?

32:57.108 --> 32:59.235
Oh, I told the guard
at the gate...

32:59.310 --> 33:00.777
that I had to go
to my reserve meeting.

33:00.845 --> 33:02.437
That's how I got on the base.

33:03.114 --> 33:05.844
Well, I have to get these
departmental budget reports...

33:05.916 --> 33:08.009
to the admiral by 5:00, so...

33:08.185 --> 33:10.483
Oh. Right. Right.

33:16.026 --> 33:18.221
You know, if it was for me,
I wouldn't even ask.

33:18.295 --> 33:19.353
T.C.

33:19.430 --> 33:21.762
I'm not asking.
I'm just trying to explain.

33:21.832 --> 33:24.733
Well, you already told me all
about that girl disc jockey.

33:31.742 --> 33:33.471
Lieutenant Poole...

33:34.478 --> 33:36.639
I don't know if you've ever
seen combat duty before.

33:36.714 --> 33:39.182
If you think I'm gonna listen to
you, T.C., you're sadly mistaken.

33:39.250 --> 33:41.445
<i>But I think I can tell you
a little something about it.</i>

33:41.519 --> 33:44.113
What you're asking me to do,
I could lose my job.

33:44.188 --> 33:45.553
Sometime when you're
out in the dark...

33:45.623 --> 33:47.352
with mortar fire
going on all around you...

33:47.425 --> 33:49.325
sometimes you just
don't even know...

33:49.393 --> 33:51.861
if you're going to make it
back in one piece or not.

33:51.929 --> 33:55.626
So that anything, anything that ties
you to home helps keep you alive.

33:55.699 --> 33:58.190
T.C.
- I don't know about anybody else...

33:58.302 --> 34:01.794
but one of the things that pulled
me through a lot of hard times...

34:01.872 --> 34:05.569
was the sound of Holly Fox's
voice coming at me from RVN.

34:06.577 --> 34:07.942
It meant home.

34:08.012 --> 34:10.810
It meant that somehow,
maybe, just maybe...

34:10.880 --> 34:12.712
I might make it back alive.

34:13.050 --> 34:15.280
What you're asking me to do...

34:16.587 --> 34:18.350
they could court-martial me.

34:18.656 --> 34:20.851
Anything I can do to help her.

34:21.492 --> 34:22.822
I owe her.

34:26.664 --> 34:28.655
What unit was Cassidy in?

34:31.902 --> 34:33.665
<i>♪♪ Ready for lunch?</i>

34:33.737 --> 34:36.570
<i>Oh, gee, Benny, I've got a lot
of stuff I gotta catch up on.</i>

34:36.639 --> 34:38.972
I gotta take a rain check.
Why don't you ask Lori?

34:39.844 --> 34:41.243
Me and Lori?

34:41.879 --> 34:42.937
Lunch?

34:43.013 --> 34:44.172
Alone?

34:45.882 --> 34:47.009
Yeah.

34:47.083 --> 34:49.780
Yeah. I'll see you
in a couple of hours.

34:50.353 --> 34:51.514
Or so.

34:57.862 --> 35:00.262
KTDE, would you like
to make a request?

35:00.331 --> 35:02.162
<i>Yes. The
pleasure of your company.</i>

35:02.233 --> 35:03.632
Hey, Thomas!

35:05.035 --> 35:06.366
I'm glad you called.

35:06.437 --> 35:08.268
What, you sound
on top of the world today.

35:08.339 --> 35:09.397
Oh, well...

35:09.473 --> 35:10.997
catching that kid
who was making the calls.

35:11.075 --> 35:13.373
I guess, the whole thing just
upset me more than I thought.

35:13.611 --> 35:15.101
<i>Anyhow, thanks.</i>

35:15.346 --> 35:16.404
Thomas-

35:16.480 --> 35:19.449
<i>And I've got some good news
and some bad news.</i>

35:20.150 --> 35:22.641
The bad news is I'm not gonna
be able to make it to the party.

35:22.720 --> 35:25.314
Hey, I'm sorry I'm late. I got
held up at Ice Pick's. Rick, please.

35:25.389 --> 35:26.515
<i>But the good news is...</i>

35:26.590 --> 35:27.750
I have decided...

35:27.825 --> 35:31.158
I'm going to broadcast
my entire show, live...

35:31.228 --> 35:33.162
in honor of Jonathan Higgins...

35:33.230 --> 35:35.824
<i>a full three hours of rock
and roll from Great Britain.</i>

35:35.900 --> 35:37.265
<i>Isn't that terrific?
Yeah.</i>

35:37.334 --> 35:39.734
Oops.
The record's almost over.

35:39.803 --> 35:41.031
I'll talk to you later.

35:47.211 --> 35:48.405
Thomas.

35:48.479 --> 35:49.537
Where've you been?

35:49.613 --> 35:50.910
The guys arrived with the tower.

35:50.981 --> 35:52.573
You were supposed to be here
to help me connect it.

35:52.650 --> 35:54.083
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

35:54.151 --> 35:56.346
I decided to help Holly
find her boyfriend.

35:56.420 --> 35:58.149
That's what she hired me to do.

35:58.222 --> 36:00.884
Yeah, I know, but I got more
connections than you have.

36:00.958 --> 36:03.324
Anyway, I finally
got to see Ice Pick.

36:03.527 --> 36:05.290
Yeah? What'd he tell you?

36:05.462 --> 36:07.692
Hear.
Don Cassidy is no angel.

36:08.299 --> 36:11.029
It seems that he started
a network after the war.

36:11.101 --> 36:13.934
Strictly black market.
Mostly electronic stuff.

36:16.106 --> 36:17.801
Give me a hand with this cake,
will you?

36:17.875 --> 36:18.967
Sure.

36:20.077 --> 36:21.237
The Tower of London?

36:21.312 --> 36:22.802
Yeah.
I decorated it myself.

36:22.880 --> 36:24.973
Oh, gee, how could I ever tell?

36:25.049 --> 36:27.279
Anyway, the guy
was doing great business...

36:27.351 --> 36:29.148
then all of a sudden
he disappears.

36:29.219 --> 36:30.413
What, he left the Islands?

36:30.487 --> 36:32.512
I don't know. That's the
strange part about it.

36:32.590 --> 36:34.387
It's like he just vanished
into thin air.

36:34.458 --> 36:36.187
Hey, watch out!
I've got it.

36:55.746 --> 36:56.974
Hi, Don.

36:57.414 --> 36:59.279
You look great, Holly.

36:59.350 --> 37:02.080
That last hug you gave me in
Saigon had to do me 12 years.

37:03.253 --> 37:05.744
You never give up, do you?

37:06.323 --> 37:07.415
Nope.

37:09.093 --> 37:10.651
You're my one and only.

37:14.131 --> 37:16.759
Half a million guys in Nam,
and I picked you.

37:17.201 --> 37:18.190
Remember?

37:18.302 --> 37:20.065
That was a long time ago, Holly.

37:22.272 --> 37:23.466
You know why?

37:24.041 --> 37:25.099
Holly...

37:25.175 --> 37:26.972
'Cause you were the only guy
I ever met...

37:27.044 --> 37:28.636
who didn't give me that look.

37:30.414 --> 37:31.608
What look?

37:33.817 --> 37:35.842
Never mind.
Doesn't matter.

37:38.355 --> 37:40.448
The only thing that matters
is that I've found you.

37:40.524 --> 37:42.287
Holly, I'm really sorry...

37:42.493 --> 37:44.961
about all the threatening
phone calls. I was...

37:45.496 --> 37:47.327
I was just trying
to scare you off.

37:47.398 --> 37:48.695
I understand.

37:51.368 --> 37:54.394
You see, Holly...

37:54.571 --> 37:57.131
if certain people knew
that I was here...

37:57.207 --> 38:00.335
You gotta stop broadcasting
my name over the radio.

38:00.411 --> 38:03.175
My business associates,
they're getting very nervous.

38:03.714 --> 38:05.409
Don't worry about a thing, Don.

38:05.883 --> 38:07.180
It's all over.

38:08.919 --> 38:10.853
Well, I'm kind of glad
to hear that...

38:11.388 --> 38:12.650
because I-

38:14.925 --> 38:16.119
What are you doing?

38:16.660 --> 38:17.991
You were right.

38:20.097 --> 38:21.359
I don't give up.

38:25.253 --> 38:27.050
They were closing in on me.

38:27.155 --> 38:28.281
You made a fool out of me.

38:28.356 --> 38:29.448
I didn't. I didn't.

38:29.524 --> 38:31.389
There I was, waiting for you
at the church.

38:31.459 --> 38:33.188
Do you know
how humiliating that is?

38:33.261 --> 38:35.126
I'm sorry. I really am.

38:36.898 --> 38:39.594
Holly, you gotta understand
what was going on at the time.

38:39.667 --> 38:42.864
It didn't have anything to do with
the way I felt about you. I loved you.

38:42.937 --> 38:45.565
Yeah? I'd really like to hear
your side of the story.

38:46.274 --> 38:49.869
I've picked out a nice romantic
spot where we can reminisce.

38:49.944 --> 38:52.174
Sure. Sure.
Absolutely.

38:52.247 --> 38:54.647
I mean,
maybe we still can make it work.

39:01.222 --> 39:03.816
<i>Coming
back at you from KTDE, Oahu.</i>

39:03.892 --> 39:06.690
<i>Holly here
with more Beatles' best.</i>

39:07.061 --> 39:09.359
You ready?
Let's go for a walk.

39:27.182 --> 39:29.150
<i>Maybe it was
Holly's tone of voice...</i>

39:29.450 --> 39:31.918
<i>or maybe it was the fact that
the pieces of the puzzle...</i>

39:31.986 --> 39:33.214
<i>just weren't fitting together...</i>

39:33.288 --> 39:34.812
<i>but my little voice told me...</i>

39:34.889 --> 39:38.017
<i>there was some reason Holly was
skipping out on the party...</i>

39:38.092 --> 39:39.684
<i>and I wanted to know
what it was.</i>

39:40.995 --> 39:44.396
I still don't understand why you
had me put on a blazer and tie.

39:44.465 --> 39:47.093
Hardly the apparel
for a commando raid.

39:47.235 --> 39:48.566
Don't be so sure.

39:49.871 --> 39:51.133
Air support?

39:51.206 --> 39:53.367
I say, you are going
for authenticity.

39:54.075 --> 39:55.337
Shall we?

40:01.182 --> 40:03.650
I don't understand
all the secrecy.

40:03.718 --> 40:06.619
<i>I know what the Irrawaddy
Bridge looked like.</i>

40:07.222 --> 40:10.214
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

40:10.291 --> 40:13.021
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪</i>

40:13.161 --> 40:16.392
<i>♪ Happy birthday,
dear Jonathan ♪</i>

40:16.664 --> 40:19.724
<i>♪ Happy birthday to you ♪♪</i>

40:32.881 --> 40:34.849
<i>Happy Birthday, Higgins.</i>

40:35.650 --> 40:37.743
Magnum, I don't know
what to say.

40:39.120 --> 40:42.180
Except it isn't my birthday.

40:50.098 --> 40:52.965
Absolutely splendid party,
Jonathan.

40:53.034 --> 40:56.367
It was all Magnum's doing,
Agatha. A complete surprise to me.

40:56.437 --> 40:59.065
You're lucky to have
such thoughtful friends.

40:59.140 --> 41:02.166
Ostentatious, I think, would
be a more apt description.

41:03.077 --> 41:05.102
Why,
there's Mildred Worthington.

41:05.179 --> 41:07.010
I haven't seen her in weeks.

41:07.081 --> 41:08.343
Excuse me, Jonathan.

41:08.416 --> 41:09.405
Certainly.

41:09.484 --> 41:10.610
<i>Bye, Agatha.</i>

41:11.019 --> 41:12.111
Don't worry, Magnum...

41:12.186 --> 41:15.019
not a soul has tumbled to the fact
that it's not really my birthday.

41:15.089 --> 41:17.887
I still don't understand how Robin
could have had the wrong date.

41:17.959 --> 41:20.826
Mr. Masters is frightfully
absent-minded about dates.

41:20.895 --> 41:22.226
Had you consulted me...

41:22.297 --> 41:25.664
Had I consulted you, it
wouldn't have been a surprise.

41:26.000 --> 41:27.763
Yes, I see your dilemma.

41:27.835 --> 41:29.359
Great party, Higgins.

41:29.437 --> 41:30.529
Yeah.

41:31.873 --> 41:33.465
Happy birthday, Higgie baby.

41:33.541 --> 41:35.270
Why, thank you, T.C.

41:35.843 --> 41:39.301
I must say that's a very
spectacular birthday greeting.

41:41.049 --> 41:44.450
Reminds me of the birthday
I once spent in Kishkan.

41:44.519 --> 41:47.647
Excuse me, Higgie, I think we have
to catch this story some other time.

41:48.589 --> 41:49.851
Talk to you for a minute.

41:50.024 --> 41:51.116
Sure.

41:54.462 --> 41:55.952
Hello, Jonathan.

41:56.664 --> 41:57.961
<i>I say, Bingie old boy.</i>

41:58.032 --> 41:59.192
You went where?

41:59.267 --> 42:01.565
Look, I was worried about
Holly. I wanted to help.

42:01.803 --> 42:03.737
T.C., Lieutenant Poole
is my contact.

42:03.805 --> 42:05.397
Do you wanna hear
what she said or not?

42:05.473 --> 42:06.963
Well, yeah.
Of course I do.

42:07.041 --> 42:08.872
Mr. Magnum,
thanks for the invite.

42:08.943 --> 42:11.810
This English ale's got
the kick of a Molokai mule!

42:11.879 --> 42:14.347
And anytime you wanna break
into any place I'm guarding...

42:14.415 --> 42:15.677
open sesame.

42:15.883 --> 42:17.248
Great. Thanks, Ralph.

42:17.318 --> 42:19.047
I don't remember inviting Ralph.

42:19.120 --> 42:20.382
Well, maybe Holly did.

42:20.455 --> 42:22.685
Well, Lieutenant
Poole said that the NIA...

42:22.757 --> 42:24.748
is also interested
in Don Cassidy.

42:25.393 --> 42:27.122
He owes Uncle Sam.

42:27.195 --> 42:29.629
Seems he stole a fortune
from NIA electronics.

42:29.697 --> 42:31.790
I don't think Holly's gonna
want to hear all this.

42:31.866 --> 42:33.356
Oh, she already knows.

42:33.568 --> 42:35.593
He stole most of the property
from her station.

42:35.670 --> 42:36.932
Radio Vietnam.

42:37.572 --> 42:39.267
Half a million bucks worth.

42:39.640 --> 42:40.732
Was she in on it?

42:40.808 --> 42:41.797
No.

42:42.910 --> 42:44.901
Yeah, but she left
the station anyway.

42:45.446 --> 42:47.004
I guess she took it real hard.

43:02.497 --> 43:04.158
So I took a few things.

43:05.166 --> 43:07.361
It had nothing to do with you.

43:07.635 --> 43:10.627
See, some people just didn't
see it that way, Don.

43:10.705 --> 43:12.536
They knew that I was innocent.

43:12.607 --> 43:14.131
<i>But they had to have
a scapegoat.</i>

43:14.208 --> 43:15.368
Holly-
So...

43:15.443 --> 43:16.808
they forced me out of a job.

43:16.878 --> 43:18.778
I swear. I didn't know.

43:18.846 --> 43:21.144
Oh, nobody knew.
They kept it real quiet.

43:21.215 --> 43:23.342
Just whispers, like...

43:24.285 --> 43:28.187
The kind of whispers that keep you
from getting a job in town after town.

43:28.256 --> 43:30.087
You've gotta forget
about all that, Holly.

43:30.158 --> 43:31.921
What's past is past.

43:32.193 --> 43:34.286
You gotta start thinking
about the future.

43:34.362 --> 43:36.557
I got a great business
going here.

43:36.631 --> 43:38.064
Electronics?

43:40.935 --> 43:44.166
There are big, big profits
in electronics, Holly.

43:45.873 --> 43:47.363
We could be partners.

43:48.376 --> 43:51.140
I'm really not all that
interested in business, Don.

43:51.446 --> 43:53.346
I'm more interested in romance.

43:53.414 --> 43:54.642
Sure. Sure.

43:54.782 --> 43:55.874
We'll get married.

43:55.950 --> 43:57.144
Just like we...

43:58.052 --> 43:59.110
planned.

43:59.921 --> 44:01.183
Marriage?

44:03.658 --> 44:06.627
I actually was thinking
it would be more romantic...

44:06.694 --> 44:08.457
if we had a suicide pact.

44:09.363 --> 44:10.694
Don't you?

44:18.106 --> 44:19.266
Still no answer.

44:19.340 --> 44:22.503
She's gotta be there. She
said she was broadcasting live.

44:23.211 --> 44:25.805
<i>Where's Benny? They wouldn't
just leave her there alone.</i>

44:25.880 --> 44:27.905
Why not? You caught the
guy who's been calling her.

44:27.982 --> 44:30.542
<i>Well, she may not
be there but you'll always have me.</i>

44:31.719 --> 44:33.744
<i>Holly Hudson, back here with
you again. Wait a minute.</i>

44:33.821 --> 44:35.812
<i>And I'd like to dedicate
this next one to...</i>

44:35.890 --> 44:38.188
<i>old friends who've just met.</i>

44:39.360 --> 44:41.157
She isn't there. What?

44:41.462 --> 44:44.590
She taped that show when I was
at the station. She isn't there.

44:58.679 --> 45:02.274
Now, why are they leaving
before we cut the cake?

45:02.850 --> 45:04.181
I have no idea.

45:07.488 --> 45:10.013
You know, that station's
a long ways from nowhere.

45:10.091 --> 45:11.820
If Cassidy's taken her
somewhere close...

45:11.893 --> 45:14.054
we should be able to spot them
from the air.

45:14.128 --> 45:16.722
Maybe Holly isn't the one
who's in danger.

45:16.797 --> 45:18.458
She sends away
the security guard...

45:18.533 --> 45:20.296
she puts on
a prerecorded tape...

45:20.368 --> 45:23.064
and she doesn't tell anyone
she's heard from Cassidy.

45:23.738 --> 45:26.002
You think maybe
she was after him?

45:26.274 --> 45:29.243
Radio Rick to head
past the station up to Kaheo Point.

45:29.310 --> 45:30.470
Kaheo Point?

45:30.545 --> 45:32.479
Yeah. We're going
to a wedding.

45:36.150 --> 45:37.811
This doesn't make any sense!

45:37.885 --> 45:39.079
Of course it doesn't!

45:39.153 --> 45:41.178
<i>But it'll make great copy.</i>

45:41.589 --> 45:44.990
Legendary Holly
reunites with long lost love.

45:46.460 --> 45:48.860
It almost makes up
for everything.

45:53.634 --> 45:55.465
You were right.
She's got a gun.

45:55.536 --> 45:57.094
Get out of here!

45:57.171 --> 45:59.401
Get out of here!
I don't want you here.

46:00.942 --> 46:02.034
No!

46:02.109 --> 46:04.043
See how close you can get.
I'll jump.

46:28.035 --> 46:29.935
Hold it right there, Cassidy.

46:34.609 --> 46:37.476
No, no, no!
You've ruined everything!

46:37.545 --> 46:40.844
Everything I've had for 12
years, you can't take that away!

46:41.415 --> 46:43.076
Holly, it's over.

46:43.150 --> 46:44.811
It'll never be over now.

46:44.885 --> 46:47.046
Don't you come near me!
Don't you move!

46:48.723 --> 46:50.953
You already gave him 12 years.

46:52.226 --> 46:53.955
Gonna give him your life, too?

47:00.101 --> 47:01.568
Then he wins.

47:25.426 --> 47:27.986
<i>This is Holly
Hudson coming at you from KRST...</i>

47:28.062 --> 47:31.088
<i>where mellow is just
what the doctor ordered.</i>

47:31.165 --> 47:34.532
<i>But seriously, this place isn't
as bad as I thought it would be.</i>

47:34.602 --> 47:36.729
<i>And once the doctors and I
get Holly figured out...</i>

47:36.804 --> 47:38.795
<i>count on me coming for a visit.</i>

47:38.906 --> 47:41.898
<i>Till then,
we'll always have Saigon.</i>
