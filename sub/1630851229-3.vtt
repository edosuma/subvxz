<i> -Previously on</i> The Resident...
-Have either of you heard
from Devon?

00:03.229 --> 00:04.503
Hey, can I get some help
in here?! (coughs)

00:05.898 --> 00:08.065
They found him collapsed
in the elevator on the roof.

00:08.067 --> 00:09.824
What happened?

00:09.826 --> 00:11.159
Hey, sweetheart.

00:11.161 --> 00:12.827
<i> NIC:</i>
<i> Hey, how's it going so far?</i>

00:12.829 --> 00:14.238
Mama isn't here.

00:14.240 --> 00:15.997
We talked about that.

00:15.999 --> 00:18.183
Hey, it's me. Just trying again.
Call me back.

00:18.185 --> 00:20.644
She's gonna be back
tomorrow night.

00:21.856 --> 00:25.232
Conrad Hawkins?
There's been an accident.

Whoa. Where's the fire?

01:28.647 --> 01:30.589
(phone ringing)

01:35.930 --> 01:38.004
Got us a table for two at Ray's.

01:38.006 --> 01:41.683
-I adore Ray's.
-(phone buzzing)

01:44.163 --> 01:46.012
I thought you said
you were off the clock.

-(grunting)

02:32.653 --> 02:34.153
Hold on, man.

02:34.155 --> 02:36.363
They have to bring her to us!

02:39.142 --> 02:42.494
Okay. I'm good, I'm good,
I'm good, I'm good.

02:44.072 --> 02:45.581
On my count.

02:49.003 --> 02:51.244
One, two, three. (grunts)

02:51.246 --> 02:54.381
-(beeping)
-We got a problem here.
Her pressure's tanking.

02:56.201 --> 02:58.826
Why haven't
they brought her out yet?

02:58.828 --> 03:01.263
They must not be able
to move her.

03:02.666 --> 03:04.832
Conrad!

03:04.834 --> 03:06.927
(grunts)

03:06.929 --> 03:08.169
Doc, we got this.

03:08.171 --> 03:09.837
I'm not her doctor.
I'm her husband.

03:09.839 --> 03:11.839
Nic. (panting)

03:11.841 --> 03:13.266
I'll update the transport team.

03:13.919 --> 03:16.528
Nic, I'm here.
What happened?

03:16.530 --> 03:18.588
Police don't have a cause.
There were no other vehicles

03:18.590 --> 03:21.349
at the scene, no inclement
weather. No idea where

03:21.351 --> 03:22.701
she was coming from
or where she was headed.

03:22.703 --> 03:24.036
She was coming home.

03:24.038 --> 03:26.354
Wait. You're
Dr. Conrad Hawkins, right?

03:26.356 --> 03:28.040
I've heard the other medics
mention you.

03:28.042 --> 03:29.875
You're ex-military, right?

03:29.877 --> 03:30.951
Corpsman. Afghanistan.

03:30.953 --> 03:33.103
Syria. Air Force Para-rescue.

03:33.105 --> 03:35.363
You know what they teach us?

03:36.275 --> 03:39.033
Watch the monitors,
not the patient.

03:39.035 --> 03:41.595
(rapid beeping)

03:42.631 --> 03:44.473
She needs an ultrasound.

03:51.974 --> 03:54.716
McDONNELL:
There. No lung sliding.

03:54.718 --> 03:55.792
It's a tension pneumo.

03:55.794 --> 03:57.051
We can decompress her here.

03:57.053 --> 03:58.886
Pass me an angiocath.

03:58.888 --> 04:00.155
I got it.

04:00.741 --> 04:02.574
Really.

04:04.912 --> 04:07.246
(rapid beeping continues)

04:09.399 --> 04:11.658
She didn't even flinch.
What did you sedate her with?

04:11.660 --> 04:14.494
Nothing. She's not sedated
with anything.

04:15.089 --> 04:18.906
Nic, wake up. Wake up.

04:18.908 --> 04:20.676
(panting)

04:22.763 --> 04:25.430
On my count. Three, two.

04:25.432 --> 04:26.515
-One.
-One.

04:34.016 --> 04:36.566
At some point,
we will have to intervene.

04:37.927 --> 04:40.170
He can't take control
of Nic's care.

04:40.172 --> 04:43.598
I know, and we will once we know
what we're dealing with.

04:43.600 --> 04:45.433
The pneumothorax
was easily resolved,

04:45.435 --> 04:48.194
but Nic hasn't done
anything purposeful

04:48.196 --> 04:50.122
since the paramedics found her.

04:50.124 --> 04:51.957
KIT: Which could mean
a myriad of things.

04:51.959 --> 04:56.628
Accidental ingestion,
electrolyte abnormality.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.297
Sure, it's a possibility.

04:58.299 --> 05:01.449
I mean, from the neck down,
Nic appears to be okay.

05:01.451 --> 05:05.879
But the impact from the crash
may have damaged her brain.

05:05.881 --> 05:07.973
Badly.

05:07.975 --> 05:10.475
Let's not catastrophize
just yet.

05:12.813 --> 05:15.314
(panting):
Where's Nic?

05:15.316 --> 05:17.632
Ooh, Dr. Pravesh,
you're not looking too good.

05:17.634 --> 05:20.635
She's right, Devon. Slow down.
You're still recovering.

05:20.637 --> 05:21.987
I'm fine.

05:21.989 --> 05:23.805
Hey, where's Nic?

05:23.807 --> 05:26.641
She's in CT.
Conrad is with her.

05:26.643 --> 05:28.401
Kit's keeping me posted.

05:28.403 --> 05:32.055
Whoa, buddy, hold on. Hey,
didn't I just discharge you?

05:32.057 --> 05:34.391
It's Nic.
I'm not going home.

05:34.393 --> 05:36.168
Okay, but you're also not going
to badge in.

05:36.170 --> 05:37.894
Let's find you a place
to lie down.

05:37.896 --> 05:38.986
I'll order you a neb. Come on.

05:38.988 --> 05:41.155
No. It's fine.

05:41.157 --> 05:43.342
(man speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

05:44.511 --> 05:47.495
It's subtle, but
there's some evidence of edema.

05:47.497 --> 05:51.016
Yeah, but we're used to looking
at scans of older people.

05:51.018 --> 05:53.259
A young brain is bound
to look full in contrast.

05:53.261 --> 05:55.336
Well, these tiny
petechial hemorrhages in

05:55.338 --> 05:57.189
the basal ganglia tell us
there's damage.

05:57.191 --> 05:59.933
Well, the question is--
how will it evolve?

05:59.935 --> 06:01.193
KIT:
Dr. Sutton, what's our plan?

06:01.195 --> 06:02.102
CONRAD:
Place an ICP monitor

06:02.104 --> 06:03.511
and treat her with meds

06:03.513 --> 06:05.772
to lower her intracranial
pressure if it's high.

06:05.774 --> 06:07.440
And repeat the CT in four hours.

06:07.442 --> 06:10.351
Sooner. I want to know
if there's any changes.

06:10.353 --> 06:12.537
Nic is strong. She's healthy.

06:13.615 --> 06:16.541
I've had patients make it
through injuries like this.

06:16.543 --> 06:19.044
We all have.

06:19.046 --> 06:21.463
Got here as fast as I could.

06:26.778 --> 06:28.720
Oh, my God.
I'm so sorry.

06:30.057 --> 06:31.965
There's nothing
to be sorry about.

06:31.967 --> 06:34.101
Nic is gonna be fine.

06:34.803 --> 06:37.521
Does everyone hear that?

06:39.641 --> 06:41.233
Nic is gonna be fine.

06:41.235 --> 06:43.652
Go home, Pravesh.
You shouldn't be here.

06:44.646 --> 06:46.479
(door opens)

06:46.481 --> 06:47.647
(door closes)

06:47.649 --> 06:49.390
I need help over here!

06:49.392 --> 06:52.226
-Mrs. Sandoval?
-It's not me. It's Gabe.
-(wheezing)

06:52.228 --> 06:54.395
He's having trouble
breathing again.

06:54.397 --> 06:56.973
Hey, it's my favorite long-haul
COVID survivor. You missed us?

06:56.975 --> 06:58.917
Not really.

06:58.919 --> 07:01.461
-No offense.
-(laughs)

07:03.165 --> 07:04.831
Let's get you checked out.

07:04.833 --> 07:06.758
-(Gabe wheezes, whimpers)
-(shushes)

07:06.760 --> 07:09.169
Only oxygen. No tubes.

07:09.171 --> 07:12.839
Now you know I don't
make the rules, Mr. Sandoval.

07:12.841 --> 07:15.325
Just try and relax.
We've got you.

07:15.327 --> 07:18.011
He's been doing so well
since the surgery.

07:18.013 --> 07:20.772
I wrote down
his pulse oximeter reading.

07:20.774 --> 07:25.927
This is 94, 96, 93, 94.

07:25.929 --> 07:28.095
My wife is paranoid.

07:28.097 --> 07:29.931
She's thorough.

07:29.933 --> 07:31.283
We like that.

07:31.285 --> 07:33.285
CHERRY:
I try to keep him alive.

07:33.287 --> 07:37.080
His health has never been
the same since he had COVID.

07:38.183 --> 07:40.200
That's a lot of wheezing
I'm hearing.

07:40.202 --> 07:42.368
How do you feel about checking
in to the Hotel de Chastain?

07:42.370 --> 07:45.021
-Huh?
-I told you they'd admit me.

07:45.023 --> 07:46.465
-Shh.
-IRVING: Page Dr. Austin.

07:46.467 --> 07:48.800
-Mm-hmm.
-Let's get Mr. Sandoval
started on a neb,

07:48.802 --> 07:53.120
order a chest X-ray, and
give him 125 IV Solu-Medrol.

07:53.122 --> 07:55.140
Um, is Nurse Nevin here?

07:55.142 --> 07:58.477
She always likes
to know how Gabe is doing.

07:59.721 --> 08:01.295
Uh, not tonight.

08:01.297 --> 08:02.630
Sit tight.

08:02.724 --> 08:06.133
-We'll get you fixed up,
Mr. Sandoval, okay?
-(grunts)

08:06.135 --> 08:09.321
-Shh.
-(wheezing)

08:11.233 --> 08:13.733
You need to stop
beating yourself up.

08:13.735 --> 08:16.203
You saw the look on his face.

08:17.572 --> 08:20.582
(takes deep breath)

08:23.228 --> 08:25.895
He's not angry with you.

08:25.897 --> 08:27.731
He's terrified.

08:27.733 --> 08:29.249
Which is exactly

08:29.251 --> 08:31.492
how I felt when we didn't know
what happened to you.

08:31.494 --> 08:34.596
And Conrad was with you the
whole time I was unconscious.

08:35.832 --> 08:37.832
I need to be there for him.

08:37.834 --> 08:39.500
Just give him time.

08:40.262 --> 08:42.262
If Nic doesn't turn
a corner soon,

08:42.264 --> 08:45.398
there may not be much time.

09:01.933 --> 09:04.626
Inserting the electrode
into the dura.

09:05.937 --> 09:07.194
Tox screen negative.

09:07.196 --> 09:09.122
She doesn't have a drop
of alcohol in her.

09:09.124 --> 09:13.200
So her EKG
and her echo were normal.

09:13.202 --> 09:15.703
There's no evidence
of any arrhythmia

09:15.705 --> 09:16.963
that could have preceded this.

09:16.965 --> 09:18.706
(rapid beeping)

09:18.708 --> 09:20.559
(Conrad sighs)

09:20.561 --> 09:23.286
BILLIE:
Swelling on the CT
wasn't an overcall.

09:23.288 --> 09:25.455
Her intracranial pressure
is high.

09:25.457 --> 09:26.898
Then we start her
on hypersaline...

09:26.900 --> 09:28.567
Dr. Sutton?

09:28.569 --> 09:32.070
Uh, we start her on hypertonic
saline, Lasix and mannitol.

09:32.072 --> 09:34.698
-If that doesn't work...
-It has to work.

09:36.151 --> 09:38.368
Let me talk to you for a second.

09:45.143 --> 09:48.253
Billie is a strong neurosurgeon,
but if you would like

09:48.255 --> 09:50.422
a second opinion, you just name
the doctor, and I'll deliver...

09:50.424 --> 09:52.591
-I don't want another surgeon.
-No, I-I get... I know.

09:52.593 --> 09:55.427
What you want is to direct
Nic's care, but you cannot.

09:55.429 --> 09:59.931
Doing so would be a risk to Nic
that we can't let you take.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.916
You can't expect me
to do nothing.

10:01.918 --> 10:03.343
I'm not saying that,

10:03.345 --> 10:07.397
but you must give
this team the chance.

10:21.863 --> 10:23.747
(monitor beeping steadily)

10:25.125 --> 10:27.441
You don't have to stay for this.

10:27.443 --> 10:29.853
Oh, don't mind me, dear. There's
nowhere else I need to be.

10:29.855 --> 10:32.038
Oh, no. Cherry's an old pro.

10:32.040 --> 10:34.132
She sat beside Gabe
for the six months

10:34.134 --> 10:36.709
he was in ICU
recovering from COVID.

10:36.711 --> 10:38.878
Six months, one week, five days.

10:38.880 --> 10:40.880
Is "bronchoscopy" two
Os or three?

10:40.882 --> 10:43.366
-That's three.
-Ah.

10:43.368 --> 10:45.218
I-I like
to write everything down.

10:45.220 --> 10:48.462
I-I know you keep Gabe's records
in the clouds or whatever,

10:48.464 --> 10:50.390
but I like to keep
my own account right here.

10:50.392 --> 10:53.151
Hey, Devi,
park the scope right there.

10:53.153 --> 10:56.212
See how his trachea collapses
every time he breathes?

10:56.214 --> 10:58.231
That's what's causing
the wheezing.

10:58.233 --> 11:02.218
It's the tracheomalacia again.

11:02.220 --> 11:04.554
Okay, Devi, we're good.

11:04.556 --> 11:08.241
He needed all that time on
the breathing tube for COVID,

11:08.243 --> 11:10.576
but it made his trachea weak
and floppy.

11:10.578 --> 11:13.229
And given his history,
I'm afraid we're gonna have

11:13.231 --> 11:15.081
to go back
to the tracheostomy tube.

11:15.083 --> 11:17.658
-Oh, he hated that so much.
-I know.

11:17.660 --> 11:19.678
How long will he need it?

11:19.680 --> 11:21.012
Indefinitely.

11:21.014 --> 11:23.256
And he's most likely going

11:23.258 --> 11:25.666
to need the ventilator at home,
as well.

11:25.668 --> 11:28.761
I mean, the damage to
his own trachea is so extensive,

11:28.763 --> 11:32.598
it's the only way we can
get Gabe to breathe safely.

11:32.600 --> 11:36.602
Cherry, I know this is not
what any of us wanted,

11:36.604 --> 11:40.532
but I promise you,
it is the best that we have.

11:47.265 --> 11:50.691
No explanation from the police
on what caused the accident?

11:50.693 --> 11:52.669
Not yet.

11:55.865 --> 11:59.050
I texted my prayer group
to include Nic.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.636
I hope that's okay.

12:12.715 --> 12:15.291
How's she doing?

12:15.293 --> 12:17.652
Listen, about earlier.
I should...

12:20.556 --> 12:24.133
-What's this?
-Elaine Quinn,
patient from last winter.

12:24.135 --> 12:26.745
40 years old? She had the dogs?

12:26.747 --> 12:28.395
Two huskies.

12:28.397 --> 12:32.992
I remember.
Her car got hit by a snowplow.

12:32.994 --> 12:36.162
Worst TBI we'd seen,
but she recovered.

12:36.164 --> 12:38.164
If I can figure out why
she made it through,

12:38.166 --> 12:40.241
I can help Nic make it through.

12:40.243 --> 12:43.669
Elaine Quinn's scans were
entirely different than Nic's.

12:43.671 --> 12:45.338
She had a brain bleed.

12:45.340 --> 12:48.141
We were able
to intervene on that.

12:51.346 --> 12:54.680
I know that's not
what you want to hear.

12:54.682 --> 12:56.691
You think I'm in denial?

12:58.761 --> 13:00.670
I don't.

13:00.672 --> 13:04.365
I don't pretend to know at all
what this is like for you.

13:05.619 --> 13:08.119
I want to help you.

13:09.347 --> 13:11.664
I just don't want
to say the wrong thing.

13:15.870 --> 13:18.704
No. I want you
to be honest with me.

13:18.706 --> 13:21.090
I know it's bad.

13:22.694 --> 13:24.636
It is.

13:35.131 --> 13:37.131
How you doing?

13:37.133 --> 13:40.393
(sniffles)
Me? I'm fine.

13:40.395 --> 13:42.928
Well, then you're made
of something much stronger

13:42.930 --> 13:45.048
than the rest of us.
It's okay not to be okay

13:45.050 --> 13:47.492
when your critical patient
is also your friend.

13:47.494 --> 13:49.285
How are you, really?

13:51.164 --> 13:54.073
This is one of the worst nights
of my life as a doctor.

13:54.075 --> 13:56.501
And I want to cry and scream
and throw things

13:56.503 --> 14:00.063
because my best friend
should not be in an ICU bed

14:00.065 --> 14:02.757
fighting for her life.

14:04.752 --> 14:07.095
And how's Nic's progress?

14:09.516 --> 14:13.092
Her ICP is higher than
I would like, but it's stable.

14:13.094 --> 14:17.605
Stable's not the same thing
as recovering. Right?

14:19.250 --> 14:21.250
Which is why I think it's time

14:21.252 --> 14:23.010
to put her
in a phenobarbital coma.

14:23.012 --> 14:25.029
And you're worried
Conrad won't agree?

14:26.257 --> 14:30.201
This is your call--
how you approach this.

14:31.037 --> 14:33.454
You're the doctor.

14:39.195 --> 14:42.196
If we put her in a coma,
she can't wake up

14:42.198 --> 14:44.198
until the sedatives wear off.

14:44.200 --> 14:46.442
How can I know she's improving

14:46.444 --> 14:48.386
if she's being flooded
with sedatives?

14:48.388 --> 14:52.390
-We rely
on monitoring parameters.
-Mm-mm.

14:53.042 --> 14:54.684
(sniffles)

14:56.229 --> 14:59.288
Listen, I have to do something
I don't want to do.

14:59.290 --> 15:01.399
I have to talk to you the way

15:01.401 --> 15:04.277
I would the spouse
of any other patient.

15:11.152 --> 15:14.395
Unfortunately,
despite our meds,

15:14.397 --> 15:17.106
the pressure in your
wife's brain is still too high.

15:17.108 --> 15:19.308
If we don't put her
in a medically-induced coma,

15:19.310 --> 15:23.254
we risk compromising any chance
she has at recovery.

15:28.762 --> 15:31.346
(sighs)
Oh, Conrad.

15:33.249 --> 15:37.160
Nic has been my best friend
since we were children.

15:37.162 --> 15:41.180
I love her, too, and I will
do anything for her.

15:41.182 --> 15:43.590
It doesn't compare
to what you're going through,

15:43.592 --> 15:45.944
but you have to trust me.

15:45.946 --> 15:49.530
I can't. I can't let go.

15:52.010 --> 15:53.434
(sniffles)

15:53.436 --> 15:57.538
What if we do this
and it's the end, and...

15:59.442 --> 16:02.418
...and I-I can't ever talk
to her again?

16:06.782 --> 16:08.858
This is her best chance,

16:08.860 --> 16:11.544
maybe her only chance.

16:11.546 --> 16:13.513
You know that.

16:17.143 --> 16:20.203
What would Nic tell us to do
in this situation?

16:20.205 --> 16:23.231
What would she say right now?

16:27.136 --> 16:29.362
She would say, "Start the drip."

16:51.678 --> 16:53.494
It's herbal.

16:53.496 --> 16:57.390
Caffeine never does anyone
any good at this hour.

16:58.760 --> 17:01.577
Thank you, Mrs. Sandoval.

17:01.579 --> 17:03.521
How are you?

17:06.584 --> 17:08.434
Is it Gabe?

17:08.436 --> 17:11.937
Dr. Austin said
he needs another trach tube.

17:13.091 --> 17:16.659
I have a feeling that's gonna
go over like a lead balloon.

17:17.945 --> 17:20.705
You can't imagine
how relieved we were

17:20.707 --> 17:22.707
when Nic got Gabe diagnosed.

17:22.709 --> 17:27.545
Neither one of us had ever heard
of tracheomalacia.

17:27.547 --> 17:32.550
She helped us understand what
long-haul COVID would mean

17:32.552 --> 17:34.594
for Gabe, for both of us.

17:36.205 --> 17:40.633
And she made us believe
that we could face it together.

17:40.635 --> 17:42.393
Maybe it's silly at my age,

17:42.395 --> 17:46.230
but Nic made me want to go back
to school and become a nurse.

17:47.125 --> 17:49.484
She gave us hope.

17:52.297 --> 17:55.073
I wish I could thank her again
for that.

17:55.075 --> 17:59.118
You can... when she wakes up.

18:00.580 --> 18:03.748
-(door opens)
-BELL: I hope to God
you won't have to.

18:07.312 --> 18:10.112
-No updates?
-No, there's-there's
nothing yet, um,

18:10.114 --> 18:11.255
but I brought you a visitor.

18:11.257 --> 18:14.759
This is Santina Lopez
from Nexus Life.

18:14.761 --> 18:16.094
Hello, Santina.

18:16.096 --> 18:18.096
I'm sorry
you made the trip up here,

18:18.098 --> 18:20.681
but I have no need of you
at this time.

18:22.936 --> 18:25.603
I'm sorry.
Could you just give us a minute?

18:25.605 --> 18:27.396
Of course.

18:31.427 --> 18:34.854
You know, there's never
a good time to make this call,

18:34.856 --> 18:36.263
and if this were

18:36.265 --> 18:37.931
-any other patient...
-It isn't.

18:37.933 --> 18:39.117
...with a severe TBI

18:39.119 --> 18:41.285
and no trauma
to major organs...

18:41.287 --> 18:46.124
Just given everything we know
at this moment,

18:46.126 --> 18:49.034
we have to consider
every possible outcome.

18:49.036 --> 18:50.461
There are tens of thousands
of people

18:50.463 --> 18:52.463
in this country
waiting for organ transplants.

18:52.465 --> 18:56.467
I know, I have patients
of my own on that list.

18:59.046 --> 19:03.032
If the time comes
to discuss Nic's wishes,

19:03.034 --> 19:07.395
I promise I will handle it.

19:08.797 --> 19:10.890
(monitor beeping steadily)

19:10.892 --> 19:12.817
(wheezing)

19:12.819 --> 19:14.894
CHERRY:
Oh, there you are. (laughs)

19:14.896 --> 19:16.896
-You miss me?
-(wheezing)

19:16.898 --> 19:18.698
How's your breathing,
Mr. Sandoval?

19:20.385 --> 19:23.068
We should talk about
what we found on the scope.

19:23.070 --> 19:27.223
We want to put in
another tracheostomy tube.

19:27.225 --> 19:30.059
No? Honey, this isn't
a yes-or-no question.

19:30.061 --> 19:32.003
Page Dr. Austin.

19:32.005 --> 19:35.631
He should be a part
of this conversation.

19:36.734 --> 19:38.009
We'll be right back.

19:38.011 --> 19:41.070
(man speaking indistinctly
over P.A.)

19:41.072 --> 19:42.996
(Gabe clears throat)

19:42.998 --> 19:45.349
When the trach tube came out
last time,

19:45.351 --> 19:48.260
we agreed
I'd never have another one.

19:48.262 --> 19:52.097
It's okay.
Our insurance can cover it.

19:52.099 --> 19:54.750
It's not the cost, honey.

19:54.752 --> 19:56.861
I'll be tethered to a machine.

19:56.863 --> 19:59.088
(wheezing)

19:59.090 --> 20:02.742
The noise, the inconvenience.

20:04.746 --> 20:08.581
All you do is take care of me.

20:09.876 --> 20:12.359
With a trach, it's endless.

20:12.361 --> 20:15.621
I signed up for better or worse,
sickness and health.

20:15.623 --> 20:18.049
I love you.

20:18.051 --> 20:20.534
And I love you.

20:20.536 --> 20:22.511
(wheezing)

20:26.133 --> 20:28.434
That's why
I've made up my mind.

20:29.971 --> 20:31.971
I'm done, honey.

20:31.973 --> 20:37.050
No more tubes,
no more chest compressions.

20:37.052 --> 20:39.886
-Uh-uh.
-(rapid beeping)

20:39.888 --> 20:41.572
-(loud wheezing)
-No.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.816
Doctor? Dr. Devi!

20:43.818 --> 20:46.244
(wheezing)

20:46.246 --> 20:48.637
-(rapid beeping)
-We need a code airway!

20:48.639 --> 20:51.732
DNI. DNI. DNI.

20:51.734 --> 20:54.735
-DNI.
-Mr. Sandoval, you could die
without intubation.

20:54.737 --> 20:56.069
REENA:
Dr. Devi?

20:56.071 --> 20:57.496
(loud wheezing)

20:57.498 --> 20:59.832
Cancel the code. Mr. Sandoval
just informed me he's DNI.

20:59.834 --> 21:02.485
Get the BiPAP machine, please.

21:02.487 --> 21:04.003
We can keep you breathing
for now, but you need

21:04.005 --> 21:06.655
a permanent solution.

21:06.657 --> 21:08.975
(wheezing)

21:12.087 --> 21:14.755
Conrad told me not to come,
but I had to.

21:14.757 --> 21:16.348
How's Nic?

21:17.351 --> 21:19.852
-I think he'll be happy
you're here.
-(GiGi babbles)

21:19.854 --> 21:23.172
All right. Kyle's on his way.

21:23.174 --> 21:25.841
He, understandably,
is taking this very hard,

21:25.843 --> 21:27.601
and I'm worried.

21:27.603 --> 21:29.269
I'll see to Kyle.

21:29.271 --> 21:31.622
Why don't you get GiGi
to the nursery,

21:31.624 --> 21:33.273
and I'll have one of the staff
from Peds come

21:33.275 --> 21:35.459
-and help you get her settled?
-Okay.

21:35.461 --> 21:37.019
(GiGi fussing)

21:37.021 --> 21:38.354
(alarm sounding)

21:38.356 --> 21:41.114
-Her ICP is up again.
-I can get more mannitol.

21:41.116 --> 21:44.360
No. Her osmolarity
is already 320.

21:44.362 --> 21:47.546
Asymmetric pupils.
Nonreactive on the right.

21:47.548 --> 21:48.806
That's new.

21:48.808 --> 21:50.725
(alarms sounding)

21:52.979 --> 21:55.346
So is the bradycardia.
This could be a bleed.

21:55.348 --> 21:57.464
That could be something
we can fix.

21:58.300 --> 22:01.152
Let's get her to CT
to find out. Now.

22:03.881 --> 22:05.731
Kyle.

22:05.733 --> 22:07.550
Hey. Hi. Hi. Hi.

22:07.552 --> 22:11.996
Hi. I, uh... I, uh, found this,
you know, message board online.

22:11.998 --> 22:13.980
They said that sensory reminders
can be helpful.

22:13.982 --> 22:15.982
Uh, where's Nicky?

22:15.984 --> 22:19.562
She's just been brought to CT.

22:19.564 --> 22:22.231
I want to prepare you
for when you see her.

22:22.233 --> 22:25.417
Oh, is it...? It's that bad?

22:25.419 --> 22:29.162
On the outside Nic looks okay,
like she's sleeping.

22:29.164 --> 22:31.498
Well, that's good, right?

22:31.500 --> 22:33.333
Not exactly.

22:33.335 --> 22:36.078
The impact from the accident
was powerful enough

22:36.080 --> 22:39.098
-to injure her brain.
-(gasps)

22:39.100 --> 22:42.084
-It's, uh, like a severe bruise
you can't see.
-Don't.

22:42.086 --> 22:44.028
And we don't know if or when

22:44.030 --> 22:46.255
that bruise will improve
or worsen.

22:46.257 --> 22:47.773
It's got to improve.

22:47.775 --> 22:50.034
It will improve.

22:50.036 --> 22:53.186
I'm afraid, at the moment,
that's far from certain.

22:53.188 --> 22:55.114
Okay, I want...
I want to... I want to see her.

22:55.116 --> 22:56.599
I need to talk to her.

22:56.601 --> 22:59.284
(voice breaking):
I want her to know
that I'm here.

22:59.286 --> 23:03.297
Of course.
You can see her after the CT.

23:05.051 --> 23:08.719
Can... can-can-can...
can I wait in her room?

23:08.721 --> 23:10.638
Yes.

23:12.708 --> 23:14.392
There.

23:14.394 --> 23:16.042
I see it.

23:16.044 --> 23:20.064
Diffuse effacement
of the gray-white junction.

23:20.066 --> 23:22.048
Ventricular compression.

23:22.050 --> 23:24.693
Her brain is herniating.

23:28.633 --> 23:32.317
All right. So, we do
a decompressive craniotomy.

23:32.319 --> 23:33.986
That could stop the herniation.

23:33.988 --> 23:35.746
-No, I can't.
-Yes, you can.

23:35.748 --> 23:39.625
I can't reverse the injury.

23:42.163 --> 23:45.381
Nic won't recover
from this, Conrad.

23:53.749 --> 23:56.082
That's my wife in there.

23:56.084 --> 23:58.994
GiGi's mother.
The center of our world.

23:58.996 --> 24:01.522
We are not giving up on her.

24:30.861 --> 24:33.512
â™ª

24:38.202 --> 24:40.561
(sighs):
I love you.

24:41.555 --> 24:42.813
(sniffles)

24:42.815 --> 24:45.232
(sighs)

25:01.834 --> 25:03.726
This is unsurvivable.

25:03.728 --> 25:05.503
Yeah, I know.

25:10.993 --> 25:13.344
These images make it clear.

25:15.664 --> 25:18.098
Nic is gone.

25:19.668 --> 25:22.077
There's only one thing left
to do to confirm the diagnosis.

25:22.079 --> 25:24.004
The brain death exam. I...

25:24.006 --> 25:26.524
I don't think
Billie should handle that.

25:27.693 --> 25:30.010
She's going through enough.

25:30.012 --> 25:32.755
Conrad will insist
on performing the tests.

25:32.757 --> 25:34.848
No, we can't allow it.

25:34.850 --> 25:38.327
Who does that leave?

25:39.947 --> 25:42.331
Are you sure you're up for this?

25:45.861 --> 25:48.337
Am I up for it?

25:49.715 --> 25:51.790
No.

25:51.792 --> 25:55.636
Is it gonna destroy me? Yes.

25:57.965 --> 26:00.391
But it's not about me.

26:02.136 --> 26:05.045
It's about two people I love
and their child.

26:05.047 --> 26:08.566
And I'm gonna do it for Nic.

26:08.568 --> 26:10.642
And Conrad.

26:10.644 --> 26:12.444
And GiGi.

26:14.740 --> 26:19.159
(monitor beeping steadily)

26:29.997 --> 26:31.997
(Conrad groans)

26:31.999 --> 26:35.467
I got you.

26:41.267 --> 26:43.750
GiGi's asleep in the nursery.

26:43.752 --> 26:45.728
(sniffles)

26:46.797 --> 26:49.756
Kyle, I'm so sorry.

26:49.758 --> 26:53.502
Well, she looks okay.

26:53.504 --> 26:55.337
Right?

26:55.339 --> 26:57.531
I think she's gonna be okay.

27:00.527 --> 27:03.495
MARSHALL:
Kit said there are tests?

27:06.200 --> 27:08.626
Why don't we, uh, take a walk,
get some air?

27:08.628 --> 27:13.188
KYLE:
Nah, I'm gonna stay here
in case she wakes up.

27:13.190 --> 27:16.300
MARSHALL:
The doctors have
to run some more tests.

27:16.302 --> 27:19.511
We can come back
as soon as they're done.

27:20.547 --> 27:22.556
(sighs)

27:40.475 --> 27:42.451
(Conrad sighs)

27:44.479 --> 27:46.163
(sniffles)

28:05.518 --> 28:09.103
Need a hand?

28:10.764 --> 28:14.583
I called them just in case.

28:14.585 --> 28:16.443
We want to help.

28:17.438 --> 28:19.363
Thank you.

28:24.352 --> 28:27.746
Pupils are fixed and dilated.
No corneal reflex.

28:31.952 --> 28:34.670
No oculocephalic reflex.

28:44.782 --> 28:48.450
Negative oculovestibular reflex.

28:48.452 --> 28:50.894
Now I'm gonna test
her pain response.

28:50.896 --> 28:53.755
She's not feeling any pain.

28:53.757 --> 28:55.307
(Hundley crying)

28:55.309 --> 28:57.717
Once I disconnect the vent,
we wait eight minutes

28:57.719 --> 28:59.445
to see if she breathes.

29:08.639 --> 29:10.664
(rapid beeping)

29:15.162 --> 29:17.662
-Enough.
-You're a fall risk. Lie back.

29:17.664 --> 29:20.499
-Give me my clothes.
-Why? You got a hot date
to get to?

29:20.501 --> 29:22.259
-I want to go home.
-I'm not taking you home.

29:22.261 --> 29:24.428
-Then I'll call a cab.
-I won't give you the phone.

29:24.430 --> 29:26.930
I'd rather die at home
than in this hospital room.

29:26.932 --> 29:31.602
Sweetheart, can't you just
let me go?

29:31.604 --> 29:35.147
Don't sweetheart me,
you pain in my ass! (gasps)

29:35.833 --> 29:39.359
(Gabe wheezing)

29:40.613 --> 29:43.530
(Cherry whimpering)

29:50.180 --> 29:52.498
CONRAD:
Everything okay?

29:54.794 --> 29:56.668
(Cherry shudders)

29:58.613 --> 30:00.422
Is it Nic?

30:04.028 --> 30:06.953
(Cherry sighs deeply)

30:06.955 --> 30:08.380
When Gabe was at his worst,

30:08.382 --> 30:10.307
people would tell me
it was God's will.

30:10.309 --> 30:13.293
-(scoffs)
-Or "The universe won't give you

30:13.295 --> 30:15.053
more than you can handle."

30:15.055 --> 30:16.629
They didn't mean any harm,

30:16.631 --> 30:19.274
but they didn't make things
any easier.

30:27.067 --> 30:28.367
(Cherry sighs)

30:31.163 --> 30:34.331
She's going to live forever
in your heart.

30:37.336 --> 30:40.379
You need to carry Nic
inside you now.

30:42.066 --> 30:45.217
For you and your daughter.

30:53.594 --> 30:56.144
(Cherry sniffles)

30:59.507 --> 31:00.524
Cherry.

31:03.103 --> 31:05.362
Don't let him give up.

31:08.850 --> 31:11.017
(door opens)

31:11.019 --> 31:13.595
(door closes)

31:13.597 --> 31:15.447
(beeping)

31:15.449 --> 31:16.665
Time.

31:22.106 --> 31:23.772
I appreciate it.

31:23.774 --> 31:25.198
What are they doing?

31:25.200 --> 31:28.201
Wait, whoa, whoa, wait, stop!
Stop! What are you doing?

31:28.203 --> 31:29.961
Conrad, they're...
What are they doing?

31:29.963 --> 31:31.388
-They're pulling the plug?
-No.

31:31.390 --> 31:33.724
No, Mr. Nevin.
That is not what's happening.

31:33.726 --> 31:35.450
No one here wants to hurt Nic.

31:35.452 --> 31:38.787
Don't-don't manage me, Marshall.
That's my daughter in there.

31:38.789 --> 31:40.956
What you saw was a test

31:40.958 --> 31:42.232
of Nic's brain stem responses.

31:42.234 --> 31:43.808
We had to confirm
her diagnosis.

31:43.810 --> 31:45.402
What diagnosis? What?

31:45.404 --> 31:46.987
Diagnosis?

31:50.801 --> 31:52.659
I'm sorry. Nic is brain dead.

31:57.824 --> 32:01.810
N-No, no. We... uh,
we saw her hand move earlier.

32:01.812 --> 32:03.645
Conrad, tell them.
We saw it.

32:03.647 --> 32:07.215
Involuntary movements can be
triggered by spinal reflexes.

32:08.152 --> 32:10.761
I-I can see with my own eyes.

32:10.763 --> 32:12.387
She's not dead.

32:15.175 --> 32:17.993
The way Nic talks about you,

32:17.995 --> 32:20.086
she thinks
you're a miracle worker.

32:20.088 --> 32:22.180
You can save everyone
in this damn hospital,

32:22.182 --> 32:24.358
but you won't save her?

32:32.267 --> 32:34.267
Her heart is still beating!

32:34.269 --> 32:36.027
CONRAD:
Her heart is beating
because of a machine.

32:36.029 --> 32:39.063
Her lungs are inflating
because of a machine.

32:39.065 --> 32:40.365
Fine, fine.

32:40.367 --> 32:41.850
Then let them do their work.
J-Just go,

32:41.852 --> 32:43.034
please, do your work.

32:43.036 --> 32:44.127
I don't care if it takes
days or weeks

32:44.129 --> 32:45.370
or months for her to wake up.

32:45.372 --> 32:47.798
-Just do it...
-She won't wake up.

32:47.800 --> 32:49.524
Nic is gone.

32:50.302 --> 32:52.527
And being kept here,
hooked up like this--

32:52.529 --> 32:54.471
that was her idea of hell, and
I'm not gonna do that to her.

32:54.473 --> 32:59.476
I will not lose another
daughter in this hospital.

33:02.206 --> 33:04.556
(crying):
She's all I've got left.

33:04.558 --> 33:06.233
Please.

33:07.302 --> 33:09.878
I intend to honor
Nic's decision.

33:09.880 --> 33:12.305
(Kyle breathing heavily)

33:12.307 --> 33:14.574
It's all I can do for her now.

33:20.482 --> 33:23.208
I will never
forgive you for this.

33:38.833 --> 33:41.518
(Conrad crying)

33:53.032 --> 33:55.032
(clears throat, sniffles)

33:55.034 --> 33:57.117
Uh... are they here?

33:58.037 --> 34:00.595
I don't normally discuss

34:00.597 --> 34:03.740
a... a patient's wishes
with the family.

34:03.742 --> 34:06.117
Nexus Life does that for us.

34:06.119 --> 34:08.436
But I insisted.

34:09.364 --> 34:13.108
While nothing can compare
to your pain,

34:13.110 --> 34:16.053
I hope you know
how much we all loved her.

34:16.055 --> 34:18.472
I do know that.

34:20.117 --> 34:21.600
She loved you.

34:26.899 --> 34:28.456
In time,

34:28.458 --> 34:32.294
I hope it will be
a comfort to you and GiGi

34:32.296 --> 34:35.130
that Nic chose
to be an organ donor.

34:35.132 --> 34:37.390
She'll be able
to save the lives

34:37.392 --> 34:39.743
of eight
critically ill patients...

34:39.745 --> 34:41.394
(sniffles)

34:41.396 --> 34:44.489
...and vastly improve the lives
of dozens more.

34:45.584 --> 34:48.734
She helped so many people
during her time at Chastain.

34:48.736 --> 34:50.587
(sobbing)

34:51.982 --> 34:53.481
It's quite miraculous

34:53.483 --> 34:56.426
that her life-saving work
will continue.

34:59.264 --> 35:03.391
If there is anything I can do...

35:05.829 --> 35:07.679
This is what she wants.

35:07.681 --> 35:10.181
So... (sniffles)

35:10.183 --> 35:13.110
...this is what I want.

35:13.779 --> 35:15.928
(exhales)

35:15.930 --> 35:18.198
(sighs deeply)

35:42.808 --> 35:45.124
So, we need to get Mr. Sandoval

35:45.126 --> 35:47.627
on my surgery schedule
immediately.

35:47.629 --> 35:49.295
He is a match for a donor

35:49.297 --> 35:51.964
who can provide
a trachea replacement.

35:51.966 --> 35:54.542
A trachea transplant?

35:55.303 --> 35:56.878
We never knew
that was an option.

35:56.880 --> 35:59.656
Oh, it wasn't. Until now.

36:05.164 --> 36:08.814
This is an extremely rare
opportunity for Gabe.

36:08.816 --> 36:10.575
It could mean
an end to his pain.

36:10.577 --> 36:12.294
(soft laugh)

36:14.155 --> 36:17.081
I don't know how to convince him
to have another surgery.

36:17.083 --> 36:20.343
He is refusing
any and all treatments.

36:22.572 --> 36:23.663
(wheezing)

36:23.665 --> 36:25.015
Where are my shoes?

36:25.017 --> 36:26.332
Did my wife hide my shoes?

36:26.334 --> 36:29.411
-Mr. Sandoval, please.
-AUSTIN: Mr. Sandoval.

36:30.189 --> 36:32.080
Word has it
that you want to check out.

36:32.082 --> 36:36.008
That's right. No surgery.

36:36.010 --> 36:37.343
No surgery?
Wow, you talk a big game

36:37.345 --> 36:39.863
for a man
who can barely breathe.

36:39.865 --> 36:42.199
I can't live with that tube.

36:42.201 --> 36:44.367
Okay, so how about
we ditch the tube?

36:44.369 --> 36:47.111
Huh? No more looking
for a quick fix.

36:47.113 --> 36:48.872
I'm talking
a total trachea replacement.

36:48.874 --> 36:52.584
A trachea transplant would mean
breathing on your own again.

36:54.362 --> 36:57.196
-What if it doesn't work?
-What if the sky falls?

36:57.198 --> 36:59.365
What if the simulation fails?

36:59.367 --> 37:02.627
Most importantly, Gabe,
what about your wife?

37:02.629 --> 37:05.296
-Cherry knows my wishes.
-CHERRY: Don't fool yourself.

37:05.298 --> 37:08.207
You're not making wishes.
You're giving up.

37:08.209 --> 37:10.301
AUSTIN:
Damn straight you are.

37:10.303 --> 37:11.895
And there's not a soul
in this hospital

37:11.897 --> 37:13.713
who wants to hear anything
about giving up.

37:13.715 --> 37:17.959
Not today. Not after we've lost
the best nurse practitioner

37:17.961 --> 37:19.736
we've ever known.

37:19.738 --> 37:21.129
Nurse Nevin?

37:21.131 --> 37:24.299
-She didn't make it.
-(wheezes)

37:24.301 --> 37:26.910
And now Dr. Hawkins
has to figure out

37:26.912 --> 37:29.654
how to live without
the love of his life.

37:29.656 --> 37:32.249
Like you want me to do.

37:33.660 --> 37:36.235
Gabe, listen to me.

37:36.237 --> 37:38.904
When millions lost their lives

37:38.906 --> 37:40.982
during the pandemic,
you survived.

37:40.984 --> 37:43.635
There's no rhyme,
there's no reason.

37:44.763 --> 37:47.097
You are a unicorn, Gabe.

37:47.099 --> 37:49.824
And every person
in this room knows

37:49.826 --> 37:52.084
that your party is not over.

37:52.086 --> 37:53.845
So come on, brother,
what do you say?

37:53.847 --> 37:57.732
You want to see what life
still has left to offer?

38:01.387 --> 38:03.363
(crying)

38:05.342 --> 38:08.243
-Let's do it.
-(sobbing)

38:10.938 --> 38:13.939
You heard the man, Dr. Devi.

38:13.941 --> 38:15.625
Let's do this.

38:15.627 --> 38:18.378
(laughing)

38:20.799 --> 38:23.591
(GiGi babbling)

38:24.636 --> 38:26.694
(Conrad speaks indistinctly)

38:27.472 --> 38:31.716
You know, you don't have
to do this right now.

38:31.718 --> 38:33.601
Not until you're ready.

38:34.980 --> 38:37.314
I don't think
I'll ever be ready.

38:38.966 --> 38:40.734
Thank you, Dad.

38:47.567 --> 38:49.659
Look who's here, Nic.

38:49.661 --> 38:51.703
(GiGi grunting)

38:52.998 --> 38:55.390
(Conrad grunts)

38:55.392 --> 38:57.500

38:57.502 --> 38:59.577
