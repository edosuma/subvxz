01:37.273 --> 01:39.687
You know, some of these
expenses look really high.

01:39.688 --> 01:42.724
Travel...
This meal budget?

01:42.758 --> 01:44.859
Well, it's mostly
take-out.

01:44.893 --> 01:46.360
"Take-out" doesn't mean
on budget.

01:46.395 --> 01:49.364
Though I will say
this looks pretty tasty.

01:49.398 --> 01:50.532
It is. It's from
the little Moroccan place

01:50.566 --> 01:51.533
around the corner.

01:51.567 --> 01:52.734
I'd go easy on that sauce.

01:52.769 --> 01:54.336
It's pretty spicy.

01:54.371 --> 01:56.706
- Thanks for the warning.
- It's called harissa.

01:56.740 --> 01:59.142
First time I experienced it
was in the hotel Saint George

01:59.177 --> 02:00.444
in Algiers.

02:00.479 --> 02:02.146
It was so hot,
just a few drops

02:02.181 --> 02:04.482
rendered the entire meal
practically inedible.

02:04.516 --> 02:08.753
I love the harissa
at the Saint George.

02:08.788 --> 02:11.492
You've been
to the Saint George?

02:11.526 --> 02:12.993
Don't look so surprised.

02:13.028 --> 02:15.230
What'd you think, I was just
some faceless pencil pusher?

02:15.264 --> 02:17.566
No, I just wouldn't expect
what you do

02:17.601 --> 02:20.236
to allow you much time
to world travel.

02:20.271 --> 02:22.473
Yeah, well,
I was an army brat.

02:22.507 --> 02:25.309
So I grew up in some
very strange places.

02:25.343 --> 02:30.314
Pakistan, Philippines,
Bolivia.

02:30.349 --> 02:34.718
And I still like to go native
when I get the chance.

02:34.753 --> 02:36.587
I like to veer off
the beaten path myself.

02:36.621 --> 02:40.024
There's lessons in thinking
outside the box.

02:40.058 --> 02:43.327
When I hiked across Borneo,

02:43.361 --> 02:45.763
they told me to
stick to the map.

02:45.797 --> 02:47.531
I threw it away
after 15 minutes.

02:47.566 --> 02:51.536
That was probably stupid.

02:51.571 --> 02:53.973
Well, clearly I have put you
in the wrong box.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.342
Well, you're a psychiatrist.
You're not supposed to do that.

02:56.377 --> 02:58.378
Well, the doctor's not in
just now.

02:58.412 --> 03:01.015
But I'm delighted to have
been proven wrong.

03:04.754 --> 03:08.524
Gotta love the high hopes
of New York sports fans,

03:08.559 --> 03:12.162
but this is a team that just
can't seem to catch a break.

03:12.196 --> 03:14.899
I spoke with Cheryl
this morning.

03:14.933 --> 03:15.933
I mean, can you believe
these guys?

03:15.968 --> 03:18.369
They play no defense,
no offense.

03:18.404 --> 03:19.871
Why am I still a fan?

03:19.905 --> 03:21.673
She told me
some really big news.

03:21.708 --> 03:24.343
- She's pregnant.
- That's good, right?

03:27.714 --> 03:30.015
Yeah, for her it is.

03:30.050 --> 03:31.784
Jeannie...

03:31.818 --> 03:33.419
You told me
you wanted kids, Bill.

03:33.453 --> 03:36.255
You know that's
a very big decision, right?

03:36.290 --> 03:38.324
So what,
you've changed your mind?

03:41.262 --> 03:43.697
No, that's not
what I said, but--

03:43.731 --> 03:45.365
We've been thinking
about this for years.

03:45.399 --> 03:47.634
We don't have forever.

03:47.668 --> 03:50.304
I don't have forever.

03:51.940 --> 03:55.210
Jeannie. Jeannie.

04:00.117 --> 04:04.120
Gary's sick?
What's he got?

04:04.154 --> 04:06.489
It's that flu
that's going around, I think.

04:06.523 --> 04:08.658
I could come by and take
a look at him if you'd like.

04:08.692 --> 04:11.862
No. It's nothing
serious.

04:11.896 --> 04:13.364
He's gonna have to
stay home, though.

04:13.398 --> 04:15.466
Well, just tell him
we hope he feels better,

04:15.501 --> 04:17.601
and that we're gonna
miss him.

04:17.637 --> 04:20.105
Yeah. Good-bye.

04:24.845 --> 04:26.212
I want to go to work.

04:26.246 --> 04:27.647
You can't.

04:27.681 --> 04:29.815
Dr. Rosen says
you have the day off.

04:29.849 --> 04:32.017
No, I have to put my lunch
in the refrigerator.

04:32.051 --> 04:34.319
And then I have to greet
my co-workers appropriately.

04:34.353 --> 04:36.855
And then--then I have
my morning therapy session.

04:36.889 --> 04:39.323
Gary, not today, please.

04:48.100 --> 04:50.502
That's cute.
Trying to fix it?

04:50.536 --> 04:53.438
Hey, this thing
burns my toast every time.

04:53.473 --> 04:55.974
I turn my back for a second,
it's charred.

04:56.009 --> 04:58.945
You know you can buy
another one for, like, 20 bucks.

04:58.979 --> 05:01.314
Yeah. I fix lots of things,
thanks.

05:01.349 --> 05:03.483
Men and their tools.

05:07.322 --> 05:09.390
You'll see.

05:09.424 --> 05:11.759
Perfect toast every time.

05:15.129 --> 05:16.996
Nina, could I see you?

05:19.633 --> 05:20.866
Hey.

05:20.901 --> 05:23.969
So you and Cameron,
is something going on?

05:24.003 --> 05:26.104
You know, flirtations?

05:26.138 --> 05:27.505
Did Rachel say something?

05:27.540 --> 05:29.641
No. I'm sure it's
perfectly innocent.

05:30.777 --> 05:31.877
I just want to make sure
it stays that way.

05:31.912 --> 05:33.513
- It's nothing.
- Good.

05:33.547 --> 05:36.950
Hello, Kathy.
Yes, good morning.

05:36.984 --> 05:39.519
I thought you might
find this interesting.

05:39.554 --> 05:41.722
Beautiful little piece
of toast--golden brown.

05:41.756 --> 05:43.658
Perfect little crust.

05:43.692 --> 05:47.128
Just like I said
it was gonna be.

05:47.163 --> 05:48.363
Agent Sullivan just called.

05:48.397 --> 05:50.765
Apparently we have
an Alpha missing.

05:50.800 --> 05:52.968
Skylar Adams.

05:55.004 --> 05:58.374
It was someone
who's smarter than me.

05:58.408 --> 06:00.809
Skylar's smarter
than just about anyone.

06:00.844 --> 06:03.980
She was always inventing things,
even when we met her.

06:04.014 --> 06:05.381
That's her special
ability--

06:05.416 --> 06:08.517
creating things people have
never seen before.

06:08.552 --> 06:12.522
Taking things apart,
putting them together.

06:12.556 --> 06:13.856
Yeah, well,
she should have learned

06:13.891 --> 06:18.528
to invent a better door,
I'll tell you that much.

06:18.562 --> 06:22.798
Five tactical assault boots
and some blood, but not a lot.

06:22.833 --> 06:25.034
There are two wounded,
but not fatally.

06:25.068 --> 06:27.804
Well, the question is
who the hell were they?

06:27.838 --> 06:30.073
Whoever they were,
she was ready.

06:30.107 --> 06:31.908
Kept the prototype
in this cabinet,

06:31.942 --> 06:34.044
had the entire thing
ready to blow.

06:34.078 --> 06:36.146
Bad guys come
through the front door,

06:36.180 --> 06:37.514
she's out that window
in ten seconds.

06:37.548 --> 06:39.182
She was always good at
getting herself out

06:39.217 --> 06:40.350
of sticky situations.

06:40.384 --> 06:42.285
She's what you call
your classic

06:42.320 --> 06:44.187
catch-and-release Alpha,
huh?

06:44.222 --> 06:46.289
The usual tests
and interviews.

06:46.324 --> 06:49.092
Posed no threat to society,
so back to the wild.

06:49.126 --> 06:50.360
So you guys were friends?

06:50.394 --> 06:53.196
Skylar never really
had friends.

06:53.230 --> 06:55.698
She was always more interested
in things than people.

06:55.732 --> 06:58.001
So when's the last time
you spoke to her?

06:58.035 --> 06:59.569
We haven't spoken
in years.

06:59.603 --> 07:02.038
All right, don't worry...
We're gonna find her.

07:05.375 --> 07:07.710
Bill, I think
I found something.

07:10.681 --> 07:13.482
- Skylar Adams.
- Yeah, Skylar Adams.

07:13.517 --> 07:14.951
No, doesn't ring a bell.

07:14.985 --> 07:16.652
Yeah, well, she buys
your customized parts.

07:16.687 --> 07:18.221
Many people do.

07:18.255 --> 07:20.656
We have reason to believe
that she might be in trouble.

07:20.691 --> 07:22.258
Oh, I'm sure
she might be.

07:22.293 --> 07:24.294
You know, with people
like you chasing her down.

07:24.329 --> 07:25.563
We're trying to help her.

07:25.597 --> 07:27.765
You're from the government.

07:27.799 --> 07:28.866
You don't want to help her.

07:28.900 --> 07:30.168
You know, you want
to control her.

07:30.202 --> 07:31.302
You want to control everyone...

07:31.337 --> 07:34.439
Rachel, look at this.

07:34.473 --> 07:36.441
Cuts up their
credit cards,

07:36.475 --> 07:38.109
who won't buy your
mass-produced garbage.

07:38.144 --> 07:40.345
You might want to
step into that.

07:40.380 --> 07:41.614
Let me see you and your
friends survive one day

07:41.648 --> 07:42.915
without the government.
Of course you think that.

07:42.949 --> 07:44.149
They want you to.

07:44.184 --> 07:47.186
They trained you to
in their schools

07:47.221 --> 07:48.454
and in the corporate-run
media.

07:48.489 --> 07:49.488
It is all a part of the plan.

07:49.523 --> 07:50.823
Yeah, got the message.

07:50.857 --> 07:52.725
Down with the man.

07:52.759 --> 07:56.094
Now be a sweetheart
and tell us exactly

07:56.128 --> 08:00.264
where we can find Skylar Adams.

08:00.299 --> 08:01.732
She stopped by last night,

08:01.767 --> 08:03.768
looking to sell off
some of her work.

08:03.802 --> 08:06.137
She needed to make
some extra cash.

08:06.171 --> 08:07.938
Said she was meeting
a buyer

08:07.972 --> 08:10.140
at the Brooklyn Heights
Farmers Market.

08:10.174 --> 08:12.476
Come on, let's go.

08:30.696 --> 08:32.496
You got the money?

08:32.530 --> 08:34.765
You got the product?

08:42.174 --> 08:44.475
So just ten minutes
a night?

08:44.510 --> 08:45.677
You'll feel like you slept
eight hours.

08:45.711 --> 08:49.213
Satisfaction guaranteed.
I'm in kind of a hurry.

09:03.695 --> 09:05.495
Needle in a haystack.

09:05.530 --> 09:08.732
Yeah.

09:08.767 --> 09:10.934
I hear something.

09:10.969 --> 09:12.103
Footsteps running.
Female.

09:12.137 --> 09:15.239
Three men in pursuit.
Assault boots. This way.

09:15.274 --> 09:16.841
- Okay, let's split up.
- I'll follow Rachel.

09:16.875 --> 09:18.443
Dr. Rosen, go get the car.
Nina, with me.

09:18.477 --> 09:20.245
We'll cut her off
at the exit.

09:50.438 --> 09:52.907
Hold it right there!

10:01.950 --> 10:03.117
Ohh! Aah!

10:03.151 --> 10:05.285
Agh!

10:05.320 --> 10:07.454
Come on!
Come on! Come on!

10:12.459 --> 10:15.361
- Let's go.
- Everyone in? Let's go.

10:18.791 --> 10:20.341
You were following me?

10:21.267 --> 10:22.503
Skylar, for some reason,

10:22.504 --> 10:25.339
I thought you'd be
more pleased to see me.

10:25.677 --> 10:26.497
Gum?

10:26.498 --> 10:28.312
You promised you'd
leave me alone.

10:28.419 --> 10:32.255
We have left you alone...
for five years.

10:32.290 --> 10:33.757
We heard that you were
in trouble.

10:33.791 --> 10:35.592
That you'd been attacked.

10:35.627 --> 10:36.693
It's nothing
I can't handle.

10:36.728 --> 10:38.595
You blew up your apartment.

10:38.630 --> 10:41.065
These people who are
after you, who are they?

10:41.099 --> 10:43.467
Skylar, you have to have
some idea.

10:43.502 --> 10:45.537
I make things.

10:45.571 --> 10:47.540
People like them.
They make an offer.

10:47.574 --> 10:51.677
I turn them down.
They tend to get upset.

10:51.711 --> 10:53.012
That sound familiar?

10:53.046 --> 10:55.281
Yes, it does.

10:55.316 --> 10:57.251
Yes, I made you an offer.

10:57.285 --> 11:00.154
I wanted you
to work with me.

11:00.188 --> 11:01.656
But I wasn't upset
when you said no.

11:01.690 --> 11:04.292
I respected your decision.

11:04.326 --> 11:05.393
What do you want
from me?

11:05.427 --> 11:07.328
Skylar, you're in danger.
Right?

11:07.363 --> 11:10.364
That's why we brought you here,
where you'd be safe.

11:10.399 --> 11:11.933
We want to help you.

11:11.967 --> 11:14.335
But in order to do that,
we need to know the truth.

11:14.370 --> 11:17.438
Who these people are
who are after you,

11:17.473 --> 11:19.807
and how do they
keep finding you?

11:19.842 --> 11:21.809
Well, I told you
I have no idea.

11:21.844 --> 11:24.278
Skylar, who are you
talking to?

11:26.415 --> 11:29.117
Look at your hands,
the way you're sitting.

11:29.151 --> 11:30.384
I know you're
holding something back.

11:36.358 --> 11:38.026
This is the part
where you push me, right?

11:38.060 --> 11:39.627
Skylar...

11:39.661 --> 11:40.895
No--

11:40.929 --> 11:42.329
We're on your side.

11:42.364 --> 11:45.900
No one is gonna make you do
anything against your will.

11:45.934 --> 11:49.905
So then I guess
I'm free to go?

11:51.875 --> 11:56.145
Well, there's a few things
we need to tend to first.

12:10.760 --> 12:13.028
You know, you might want
to take it easy on this thing,

12:13.063 --> 12:15.363
especially with our guest
over there.

12:15.398 --> 12:16.731
I think she's on their side.

12:16.766 --> 12:18.867
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

12:18.901 --> 12:21.235
You know, that was a...

12:21.270 --> 12:23.337
That was a hell of a bottle toss
you threw today, man.

12:23.372 --> 12:25.673
I think I pulled something.

12:25.707 --> 12:28.542
Your son...
he plays baseball too?

12:28.576 --> 12:30.510
Tyler? Oh, yeah.

12:30.545 --> 12:32.179
How's his arm?

12:32.213 --> 12:33.714
Oh, not like mine.

12:33.748 --> 12:36.149
Then again, you know,
I didn't really notice

12:36.184 --> 12:38.018
anything special
till I was in high school, so...

12:38.052 --> 12:40.319
So he's just a normal kid,
like--

12:40.354 --> 12:41.988
Yeah. I mean,
he's not like you and me,

12:42.022 --> 12:44.290
if that's what you mean.

12:44.325 --> 12:45.759
Why you asking?

12:45.793 --> 12:49.296
Just--
I was just curious.

12:49.330 --> 12:50.964
Just wondering.

12:55.871 --> 13:00.341
Gary. Lunch.

13:00.376 --> 13:01.543
It's Monday.

13:01.577 --> 13:02.811
I have my lunch
in the break room.

13:02.845 --> 13:05.413
Mondays I usually do
the shipping invoices,

13:05.448 --> 13:06.615
but not today.

13:06.649 --> 13:09.751
Everyone else is at work
except me.

13:09.785 --> 13:12.153
And Dr. Rosen never said
that I had a day off.

13:12.187 --> 13:14.789
You lied to me.

13:14.823 --> 13:16.290
Yeah, you lied to me.

13:16.324 --> 13:20.895
And Dr. Rosen lied
to me for a long time.

13:20.929 --> 13:22.763
You're not
working there anymore.

13:22.797 --> 13:24.131
I have to.
That's my job.

13:24.165 --> 13:25.732
- You've got another job.
- No--

13:25.767 --> 13:27.968
Yeah, I talked
to Uncle Alan,

13:28.002 --> 13:30.437
and he said he has a position
for you in data entry.

13:30.472 --> 13:32.573
I don't work for Uncle Alan.
I work for Dr. Rosen.

13:32.607 --> 13:34.975
Yeah, well,
it's not safe for you, Gary.

13:35.009 --> 13:37.410
That--that stuff
that I told you,

13:37.444 --> 13:38.611
that's top secret.

13:38.646 --> 13:40.346
And I wasn't even supposed
to tell you.

13:40.381 --> 13:42.849
Well, you did tell me,
and I'm not gonna let him

13:42.883 --> 13:44.984
endanger you ever again.

13:45.019 --> 13:46.719
- End of story.
- No, it's not!

13:46.753 --> 13:48.554
You can't--
look, I'm an adult,

13:48.588 --> 13:50.456
and you can't tell me
what to do.

13:50.490 --> 13:52.324
I make--I make
my own life choices.

13:52.358 --> 13:53.992
Not this time you don't,
kiddo.

13:54.026 --> 13:56.361
Yeah, I--
yeah, get out!

13:56.395 --> 13:59.297
- Gary...
- I said get out!

14:18.352 --> 14:20.220
A few more tweaks,

14:20.254 --> 14:22.556
you could probably turn that
into a time machine.

14:22.590 --> 14:25.058
I already did.

14:25.093 --> 14:27.027
I'm visiting you
from the future.

14:27.062 --> 14:28.962
Yeah, but the future you
would have even more tattoos.

14:28.996 --> 14:32.032
You have a lot more
since the last time I saw you.

14:32.067 --> 14:33.434
And you are still
a blank canvas.

14:33.468 --> 14:36.737
That time we went
bar-hopping in Soho

14:36.771 --> 14:38.639
was the closest
I ever got.

14:38.673 --> 14:40.173
One more Cosmopolitan
and you would have got

14:40.207 --> 14:41.708
that devil on your thigh.

14:41.742 --> 14:44.143
And a lifetime of regret.

14:45.712 --> 14:48.814
How much longer
am I gonna be in here?

14:48.849 --> 14:50.249
Nice work, Lee.

14:50.284 --> 14:51.717
Well, we're not
quite finished.

14:51.752 --> 14:54.287
And I don't think it would be
a good idea to let her go

14:54.321 --> 14:56.055
until we know
who's after her.

14:56.089 --> 14:57.323
I have no intention
of releasing her.

14:57.357 --> 14:58.758
Cley's on his way
to collect her right now.

14:58.792 --> 15:02.961
Cley? When did you decide
to bring Cley in on this?

15:02.996 --> 15:05.564
Hours ago, Lee.
He'll be here any minute.

15:05.598 --> 15:08.367
Skylar,
you can trust me.

15:08.401 --> 15:10.202
You can trust Rosen.

15:10.236 --> 15:12.137
Tell us who's after you.

15:12.172 --> 15:14.273
Rosen is
a government flunky.

15:14.307 --> 15:16.208
You all are.

15:16.242 --> 15:19.444
He's in his office with them
right now taking orders.

15:19.479 --> 15:20.746
Rosen's no pushover,
believe me.

15:20.780 --> 15:23.215
Yeah, I'm sure that's
what he tells himself.

15:23.249 --> 15:27.219
But he's part of the system,
and so are you.

15:27.254 --> 15:29.055
You know that
better than me.

15:31.892 --> 15:34.594
Her abilities are
extremely valuable, Lee.

15:34.628 --> 15:35.995
If we don't take her,
someone else will.

15:36.029 --> 15:37.930
Someone else is already
trying to.

15:37.965 --> 15:40.466
I'm aware of that, but--

15:40.501 --> 15:42.869
hmm, if you don't mind
me asking,

15:42.904 --> 15:44.271
what do you intend
to do with her?

15:44.306 --> 15:45.806
Place her in
protective custody,

15:45.841 --> 15:48.075
where she'll be free
to develop her technology

15:48.109 --> 15:49.943
and be compensated
very generously.

15:49.978 --> 15:52.112
Do you really think Skylar
is going to go along with that?

15:52.147 --> 15:54.081
It's not her choice.
It's not ours, either.

15:54.115 --> 15:55.583
Well, whose choice
is it then?

15:55.617 --> 15:58.352
There's a chain of command
that we all have to follow.

15:58.386 --> 16:01.055
Hmm. Oh.

16:01.090 --> 16:04.593
What happened to the woman
who throws away the map? Hmm?

16:04.627 --> 16:06.729
Forges her own path?

16:06.763 --> 16:10.567
That's on vacation, Lee.
This is work.

16:10.601 --> 16:12.602
Did you really think
some take-out Moroccan

16:12.636 --> 16:15.439
was gonna change all that?

16:39.697 --> 16:40.797
You guys get this text?

16:40.831 --> 16:42.499
There's men coming up here
with guns.

16:42.533 --> 16:43.700
- How many we got it.
- What's going on?

16:43.734 --> 16:46.003
- I have no idea.
- Three men...

16:46.037 --> 16:47.838
Heading to the elevators.
Assault boots.

16:47.872 --> 16:49.205
Get in here now.

16:49.239 --> 16:50.673
How did they know
where she is?

16:50.707 --> 16:53.008
On the security cameras.
I don't know. Don't move!

16:53.043 --> 16:56.812
Cley, where are you?
I need you here now.

17:21.367 --> 17:23.734
There they are.
Same guys from the marketplace.

17:35.783 --> 17:38.852
- D.O.D. stand down!
- Get down on the ground now.

17:38.886 --> 17:40.454
I said stand down, damn it.
D.O.D.

17:40.488 --> 17:41.722
NSA!

17:41.756 --> 17:44.758
NSA? What the hell
you guys doing here?

17:44.793 --> 17:46.761
What a mess.
I gotta get out there.

17:46.795 --> 17:48.062
Wait. Hold on.

17:48.096 --> 17:49.330
That's Skylar.

17:49.365 --> 17:51.333
- What is that?
- I don't know.

17:51.367 --> 17:52.568
She's getting out of here.

17:52.602 --> 17:54.403
Later, flunkies!

18:14.079 --> 18:15.479
Thank you, so much Alan.

18:15.529 --> 18:18.264
Um, you know what, he can start
whenever you want him to.

18:18.299 --> 18:23.069
And I will carpool him
from work. How's that?

18:23.103 --> 18:25.604
Yeah, you know what, and I'm
also gonna send you a list

18:25.639 --> 18:28.407
of things he needs,
'cause he's very particular.

18:28.441 --> 18:30.542
This ringing in my ear
just won't stop.

18:30.577 --> 18:32.311
Well, Sullivan's got it
worse than you do,

18:32.345 --> 18:34.713
and now she's at the NSA
dealing with

18:34.747 --> 18:36.181
this bureaucratic
meltdown.

18:36.215 --> 18:38.116
I don't envy her.

18:38.150 --> 18:41.185
Rachel, I thought
you'd have a coma or something.

18:41.220 --> 18:42.453
Yeah, well,
I shut everything down

18:42.487 --> 18:43.754
except for my sense of taste

18:43.788 --> 18:45.689
the minute Skylar
set this thing off.

18:45.724 --> 18:50.294
It's a stun device,
using sound and light.

18:50.328 --> 18:53.163
All these components
were taken from things

18:53.198 --> 18:54.731
right here in our offices.

18:54.766 --> 18:56.400
Nina's tablet.

18:56.434 --> 18:58.568
Even wires from
our surveillance cameras.

18:58.603 --> 19:00.237
What?

19:00.271 --> 19:02.939
She constructed this thing
right under our noses.

19:02.974 --> 19:04.808
In under ten minutes,
no less.

19:04.842 --> 19:06.276
That is some serious talent.

19:06.310 --> 19:07.777
Yeah, I thought
she was a friendly.

19:07.811 --> 19:10.012
- What happened to that?
- She was...

19:10.046 --> 19:11.780
Until Cley showed up
with his goons.

19:11.815 --> 19:13.883
Of course she took off.
What do you expect?

19:13.917 --> 19:16.585
A little appreciation.
We did save her ass.

19:16.619 --> 19:18.253
You promised her
this wouldn't happen.

19:18.288 --> 19:19.621
Yes, Nina, and I did
everything I could do

19:19.655 --> 19:20.788
to fulfill it.

19:20.823 --> 19:22.223
- But she--
- So what?

19:22.257 --> 19:24.025
We ship her off
to Binghamton,

19:24.059 --> 19:25.359
let them do experiments on her

19:25.394 --> 19:27.928
and turn her into some
psychopath, like Marcus Ayers?

19:27.962 --> 19:30.264
- She harmed federal agents.
- In self-defense.

19:30.298 --> 19:33.801
All right, this was not
self-defense.

19:33.835 --> 19:35.803
This is not up to us, Nina.

19:35.837 --> 19:37.638
You know, she's right.

19:37.672 --> 19:40.474
We do exactly
what they tell us to.

19:40.508 --> 19:43.076
We're flunkies.

20:00.029 --> 20:01.563
Queens.

20:01.598 --> 20:03.165
But you can't
take any streets

20:03.200 --> 20:04.967
starting with the letters
"L" or "B,"

20:05.002 --> 20:07.470
or the numbers 9, 5, or 4.

20:07.504 --> 20:09.638
Whatever.

20:09.673 --> 20:13.142
And hurry!

20:13.176 --> 20:14.610
What am I looking at?

20:14.644 --> 20:16.779
Turns out Skylar
was working for the NSA

20:16.813 --> 20:18.613
on various classified
projects,

20:18.648 --> 20:21.349
meanwhile sending encrypted
messages back and forth

20:21.384 --> 20:23.684
to a contact
with the call name "Z."

20:23.719 --> 20:26.954
Z? Nathan,
I'm not a cryptologist.

20:26.988 --> 20:28.222
I can't read this.

20:28.256 --> 20:31.259
Neither could the NSA.
Couldn't break the code.

20:31.293 --> 20:33.161
The Agent I spoke with said
they'd never run into

20:33.195 --> 20:34.863
an algorithm this complex.

20:34.897 --> 20:38.067
Well, Skylar was never
big on sharing.

20:38.101 --> 20:39.535
They think she's been
sharing information

20:39.569 --> 20:41.938
with a foreign intelligence
agency.

20:41.972 --> 20:45.475
Chinese, Mossad, I.S.I.

20:45.509 --> 20:47.210
That's a big leap.

20:47.244 --> 20:48.478
I got a bigger one
for you.

20:48.512 --> 20:50.746
Encryptions like this...

20:50.781 --> 20:52.681
I think she could be
communicating with an Alpha.

20:52.716 --> 20:53.949
Even Red Flag.

20:55.985 --> 20:59.087
Well, let's not
get ahead of ourselves here.

20:59.121 --> 21:00.822
I get it.
You're a psychiatrist.

21:00.856 --> 21:02.223
You like to put your patients
on the couch,

21:02.257 --> 21:03.925
talk things out.

21:03.959 --> 21:05.359
But we don't have time
for that.

21:05.394 --> 21:07.028
If you can't handle this,
step aside.

21:07.062 --> 21:09.630
I'll take care of it
myself.

21:24.848 --> 21:27.750
What are you doing here?

21:27.785 --> 21:30.953
I needed a few things.

21:34.557 --> 21:36.625
I'll mail you the check.

21:39.195 --> 21:41.729
So you came all this way
just to raid my apartment.

21:44.299 --> 21:47.467
Not exactly.

21:47.502 --> 21:52.205
So officially, this is
a joint operation with the NSA,

21:52.239 --> 21:53.840
but truth be told--

21:53.874 --> 21:55.241
It's more like
finders keepers, huh?

21:55.276 --> 21:58.044
Exactly. That's why
we have to find her first.

21:58.079 --> 21:59.379
Well, it's transmitting
a signal,

21:59.413 --> 22:01.247
but to what, I wonder?

22:01.281 --> 22:03.616
Still no Gary.
She could use him right now.

22:03.651 --> 22:05.418
I know.
I'm a little concerned.

22:05.452 --> 22:07.687
I've sent three messages
to Sandra.

22:07.722 --> 22:09.122
And, you know, Gary doesn't
do well with illness,

22:09.156 --> 22:10.390
not to mention breaks
in his routine.

22:10.425 --> 22:12.826
Listen, guys--guys, I just got
off the phone with NYPD.

22:12.860 --> 22:14.827
Right after Skylar pulled
her little sound and light show,

22:14.862 --> 22:16.763
a car was hotwired
a block away.

22:16.797 --> 22:18.231
So I had 'em put a BOLO on it,

22:18.266 --> 22:20.600
patrol unit just found it right
outside of Nina's apartment.

22:26.675 --> 22:28.409
I can't believe
I'm doing this.

22:28.443 --> 22:30.611
I'm kinda surprised myself.

22:30.646 --> 22:33.014
Well, if Rosen's not
gonna keep his promise,

22:33.048 --> 22:35.316
then I'll do it for him.

22:35.351 --> 22:38.487
- You better toss your phone.
- What?

22:38.522 --> 22:39.856
They're probably
tracking you already.

22:39.890 --> 22:41.524
Yeah, but it's got
all my photos.

22:41.558 --> 22:43.293
Okay, you're either in
or you're out.

22:45.163 --> 22:49.200
Okay, fine.

22:49.234 --> 22:50.801
Congratulations,
you're free!

22:50.835 --> 22:52.536
It actually felt
pretty good.

22:55.674 --> 22:59.542
Okay, so...
Where am I taking you?

22:59.577 --> 23:01.778
Off the map.

23:01.812 --> 23:05.215
We're gonna make
a quick stop first.

23:05.249 --> 23:07.150
I need to kill Bob.

23:13.718 --> 23:15.104
I don't want to kill Bob.

23:15.367 --> 23:16.734
Sounds like you don't have
much of a choice.

23:16.768 --> 23:19.237
He's the only reason
they keep finding me.

23:19.271 --> 23:21.639
Well, you gotta do
what you gotta do.

23:23.442 --> 23:25.510
There's a two-foot gap
between the sensors.

23:26.612 --> 23:29.048
It's a tight squeeze.

23:32.751 --> 23:34.819
How do you know so much
about this place?

23:34.853 --> 23:38.989
I designed the security.

23:39.024 --> 23:41.024
And what about him?

23:41.058 --> 23:42.959
You ladies lost?

23:45.362 --> 23:48.464
I'm gonna take a wild guess
and say Skylar was here.

23:48.499 --> 23:50.434
Well, she's not upstairs.

23:50.468 --> 23:52.335
Our espresso machine?

23:52.370 --> 23:54.204
It took me weeks
to figure this thing out.

23:54.238 --> 23:55.606
She's not answering
her phone.

23:55.640 --> 23:57.942
Guys, I just talked to the
parking attendant next door.

23:57.976 --> 24:00.244
He says Nina left
a few hours ago...

24:00.279 --> 24:01.980
In her car with some chick.

24:02.014 --> 24:03.982
So what are we saying,
Skylar kidnapped her now?

24:04.016 --> 24:05.217
Cameron,
you and I both know

24:05.251 --> 24:06.752
Nina never does anything
she doesn't want to.

24:06.786 --> 24:08.320
Let's go.

24:17.796 --> 24:21.165
Open the door.

24:21.199 --> 24:22.466
Good.

24:22.500 --> 24:25.735
And stand here...
count to a million.

24:25.769 --> 24:27.737
- 2...3...4...5...
- Slowly.

24:30.641 --> 24:32.709
Hello, Bob.

24:41.352 --> 24:43.720
So this is Bob.

24:43.755 --> 24:45.189
The one and only.

24:46.925 --> 24:49.126
And he can track down
anyone on Earth?

24:49.160 --> 24:51.529
Using their unique
bio-electric signature

24:51.563 --> 24:54.232
and existing satellite
technology.

24:54.266 --> 24:55.867
Seemed like a fun project
at the time,

24:55.901 --> 24:58.169
but lately, he hasn't been
playing for the right team.

24:58.203 --> 25:01.106
Well, if the NSA has been
following your every move,

25:01.140 --> 25:04.009
then how come they don't know
where you are right now?

25:04.044 --> 25:05.411
Processing lag.

25:05.445 --> 25:08.147
Spent months trying to fix it.
Good thing I didn't.

25:08.182 --> 25:09.649
They'll be here soon.

25:09.683 --> 25:11.384
That's pretty cool.

25:11.418 --> 25:13.118
Bob's brain.

25:13.153 --> 25:16.187
Most advanced processor
in the world.

25:21.760 --> 25:23.994
Rest in peace.

25:35.974 --> 25:38.910
No streets with "B,"
"L," 4, 5, or 9.

25:38.944 --> 25:41.614
79 bucks.
Hey, where you going?

25:41.648 --> 25:44.150
Stay here.
Hey!

25:44.184 --> 25:46.519
I'll be right back.

25:46.553 --> 25:49.189
Really? Seriously?

25:49.223 --> 25:51.024
I'll wait here.

26:23.324 --> 26:24.991
I can find you.

26:41.109 --> 26:42.842
All right,
where we going?

26:42.877 --> 26:45.044
Okay, we have to
go this way.

26:45.079 --> 26:46.245
You have to follow
the bug.

26:46.280 --> 26:48.814
- The bug?
- Yeah.

26:48.849 --> 26:50.816
Go forward.
Follow the bug forward.

26:50.850 --> 26:52.685
The bug better
have money, my friend.

26:53.954 --> 26:55.621
No, stop.

26:55.655 --> 26:57.656
It's the other way.
We have to go this way.

26:57.690 --> 27:00.458
- What, reverse?
- Yeah. Follow the bug.

27:00.493 --> 27:02.561
Follow the bug.
Back it up. Back it up.

27:02.595 --> 27:03.829
All right, all right,
I'm backing up.

27:03.863 --> 27:05.964
- Back it up. Back it up.
- I am backing it up.

27:09.269 --> 27:10.802
What the hell was
that thing?

27:10.837 --> 27:13.137
Well, according to these,

27:13.172 --> 27:16.541
it's an "incremental
bio-electrical parser."

27:16.575 --> 27:17.808
Of course it is.

27:17.843 --> 27:19.977
Gary ran away?

27:20.011 --> 27:22.279
Sandra, I thought
he was home sick.

27:22.313 --> 27:24.514
What's going on there?
Look.

27:24.549 --> 27:26.716
No, I'm just asking.

27:26.751 --> 27:29.686
Well, I find it
very hard to believe that he--

27:29.721 --> 27:31.021
Sandra, I'm gonna have to
call you back.

27:31.056 --> 27:33.357
I'm right in the middle
of something.

27:33.391 --> 27:35.393
Yes, well, tell me
as soon as he gets there

27:35.427 --> 27:37.395
or he gets in contact
with you at all.

27:37.429 --> 27:38.730
Thank you.

27:38.764 --> 27:40.765
According to my NSA contact,

27:40.800 --> 27:43.635
this machine could track down
anyone on Earth.

27:43.670 --> 27:48.207
And if coordinated
with a predator drone...

27:48.242 --> 27:49.642
Looking at Skylar's notes,

27:49.676 --> 27:51.844
the processor should be
right in here.

27:51.878 --> 27:53.145
She took it with her.

27:53.179 --> 27:55.347
Yeah, but for what?

27:55.381 --> 27:58.983
Her encrypted messages have
increased with this contact Z.

27:59.018 --> 28:02.686
She's stolen this device.
She's planning something.

28:02.721 --> 28:04.688
Apparently so.

28:04.722 --> 28:07.924
Misjudged another patient,
Doc.

28:07.959 --> 28:09.359
Gotta work on that.

28:25.711 --> 28:28.079
We need to make
one more stop.

28:28.114 --> 28:29.581
What is it now?

28:29.615 --> 28:31.549
You'll see
when we get there.

28:33.719 --> 28:36.253
Enough with the games.

28:36.288 --> 28:37.589
I want answers.

28:37.623 --> 28:40.658
It's not something
that I can talk about.

28:40.692 --> 28:43.627
You're gonna tell me
where we're going,

28:43.661 --> 28:46.497
why we took Bob's brain,
what you've been hiding.

28:46.531 --> 28:50.567
You're gonna tell me
everything.

28:50.601 --> 28:53.938
Are you pushing me?

28:53.972 --> 28:55.239
Modified contact lenses.
I came prepared.

28:55.273 --> 28:59.110
I knew I could find you.

28:59.144 --> 29:01.545
- Gary?
- Nina, what are you doing here?

29:01.580 --> 29:04.382
Who's this?

29:04.416 --> 29:06.350
- How did you find us?
- This.

29:06.385 --> 29:10.254
It's exchanging emf signals
with her phone at 81 megahertz.

29:10.289 --> 29:12.757
Nina, you have to pay
the cab driver.

29:12.791 --> 29:14.092
I don't have $812.90.

29:14.126 --> 29:15.994
Gary, you shouldn't
be here.

29:16.028 --> 29:18.196
No, it's okay.
I called Dr. Rosen,

29:18.231 --> 29:19.364
and he's coming here
right now.

29:19.399 --> 29:22.334
And the cab driver said
he deserves a big tip.

29:22.368 --> 29:25.037
This was a mistake.

29:25.071 --> 29:26.405
Thanks for helping.

29:29.686 --> 29:31.714
And then, and I couldn't open my hand.

29:31.940 --> 29:33.974
And then--
then everything was tingly,

29:34.008 --> 29:36.710
and so then
I closed my eyes.

29:36.745 --> 29:37.712
And then--
then you were here.

29:37.746 --> 29:39.614
You had a mild
electrical shock, Gary,

29:39.648 --> 29:40.849
but it's gonna be all right.
Yeah.

29:40.883 --> 29:42.417
Just relax,
take a few deep breaths.

29:42.451 --> 29:44.319
Okay, I need something else
to drink, though.

29:44.353 --> 29:45.720
I want something purple.

29:45.755 --> 29:47.689
- I got you, partner.
- Thanks, Bill.

29:47.723 --> 29:49.757
You have to recycle that.

29:49.791 --> 29:52.126
- You're gonna be all right.
- Okay.

29:52.160 --> 29:54.061
All right, Nina,
about this stop

29:54.095 --> 29:55.562
she's making before Canada--

29:55.597 --> 29:56.563
She wouldn't tell me
anything.

29:56.597 --> 29:57.730
I know you want
to protect her.

29:57.765 --> 30:00.166
So do I.
But you're not thinking clearly.

30:00.201 --> 30:01.968
She is desperate,
she's dangerous.

30:02.002 --> 30:04.971
She may even be involved
with Red Flag, for all we know.

30:05.005 --> 30:06.305
Is that what Cley's
been saying?

30:06.340 --> 30:07.974
Nina, I know
why you're doing this.

30:08.008 --> 30:09.976
When you first came
to me, you'd been doing

30:10.010 --> 30:11.777
pretty much whatever you wanted
in your life.

30:11.812 --> 30:13.846
And it got you into
some difficult situations.

30:13.880 --> 30:15.848
We helped you to control
those impulses.

30:15.882 --> 30:17.249
And I know it wasn't easy.

30:17.283 --> 30:20.052
You often felt that you were
sacrificing your true identity.

30:20.086 --> 30:21.820
But running away with Skylar
is not the way

30:21.854 --> 30:22.854
to reclaim your old self.

30:22.888 --> 30:23.921
I didn't help Skylar

30:23.956 --> 30:25.656
because I wanted
to be reckless.

30:25.691 --> 30:27.558
I did it because
we promised her we'd help her.

30:27.592 --> 30:30.695
Because it was the right thing
to do, and it felt good.

30:30.729 --> 30:32.230
Maybe you should
try it sometime.

30:34.100 --> 30:36.501
Nina, I need your help.

30:38.237 --> 30:40.471
Gary, any luck?

30:40.505 --> 30:42.506
No. She must have
cut the link.

30:42.541 --> 30:44.174
So we lost her again.

30:44.209 --> 30:46.877
Well, you know she had
some help from your girl.

30:46.912 --> 30:49.013
Gary, I got the slushy thing...
This one.

30:49.048 --> 30:50.548
I want this one.
Pomegranate...You sure?

30:50.583 --> 30:53.085
I swear,
the car was right here.

30:53.119 --> 30:55.187
- What kind of car?
- It's a Volvo station wagon.

30:55.221 --> 30:56.188
Did you see it?

30:56.222 --> 30:57.289
I just went in
for 15 minutes...

30:57.324 --> 30:59.826
Rachel?

30:59.860 --> 31:02.462
It's bio-diesel.
We can track that.

31:02.496 --> 31:04.598
- You know it's gotta be her.
- Yeah.

31:04.632 --> 31:06.834
All right, come on.
Doc, we gotta leave.

31:22.717 --> 31:24.718
You made it.
I was worried.

31:24.752 --> 31:26.987
We've gotta move quick.
Where's Z?

31:27.021 --> 31:28.188
Upstairs.

31:37.700 --> 31:39.067
Take this next right.

31:39.101 --> 31:41.436
The diesel scent
goes that way.

31:46.109 --> 31:48.377
I hear three heartbeats.

31:48.411 --> 31:50.679
Two on the second-floor bedroom
facing south.

31:50.713 --> 31:52.447
And another one
on the ground floor.

31:52.482 --> 31:54.116
All right, folks,
we should assume this Z

31:54.150 --> 31:55.351
is armed and dangerous.

31:55.385 --> 31:57.220
I wouldn't underestimate
Skylar, either.

31:57.254 --> 31:59.155
- I should talk to her her.
- Uh, maybe you shouldn't.

31:59.190 --> 32:00.857
Think you might
want to sit this one out.

32:00.892 --> 32:03.227
Okay?

32:03.261 --> 32:05.529
Okay, fine.

32:05.563 --> 32:06.563
Everything okay?

32:06.598 --> 32:07.832
Ah, it was Sullivan.

32:07.866 --> 32:11.202
Cley is on his way,
but we need to move in now.

32:11.236 --> 32:13.471
Are you ready, Gary?

32:13.505 --> 32:14.739
Yeah, it's showtime.

32:14.773 --> 32:16.307
You have to put this
in your ear.

32:16.341 --> 32:17.608
- Yeah, it's uncomfortable.
- Go.

32:17.643 --> 32:19.644
Now, keep it there, okay?

32:19.678 --> 32:20.678
Yeah.

32:29.321 --> 32:31.256
Hicks!
I said go right.

32:31.290 --> 32:32.323
You have to listen to me.

32:32.358 --> 32:33.391
I'm calling the shots here.

32:33.425 --> 32:34.492
Calm down.

32:34.527 --> 32:35.960
It's showtime.

32:35.995 --> 32:36.961
Yeah, you said that
already.

32:36.996 --> 32:38.630
Yeah, I know.

32:38.664 --> 32:39.831
All right, Gary,
where are we?

32:43.770 --> 32:45.470
Okay, coast is clear.

32:45.504 --> 32:46.505
Go right now.

32:58.451 --> 33:00.119
And who the hell are you?

33:00.153 --> 33:01.520
I'm a Secret Agent.

33:09.829 --> 33:12.030
Not so fast.

33:13.232 --> 33:15.433
You have some things
you wanna tell us.

33:33.386 --> 33:35.887
Are you looking
for my mommy?

33:56.746 --> 33:58.747
This is incredible,
I mean...

33:58.782 --> 34:00.349
I've never seen
anything like this.

34:00.383 --> 34:01.517
I mean, this is, what,

34:01.551 --> 34:03.418
way past calculus
at least, right?

34:03.452 --> 34:05.320
Oh, yes.

34:05.354 --> 34:07.455
How long has Zoe
been doing this?

34:07.489 --> 34:09.657
Since she was three.

34:09.692 --> 34:11.659
First, it was just numbers.

34:11.694 --> 34:13.061
Playing with them.

34:13.094 --> 34:14.661
Talking about them.

34:14.697 --> 34:18.166
Then she was solving equations
and proving formulas.

34:18.199 --> 34:21.168
I've never encountered
quantitative aptitude

34:21.202 --> 34:24.304
on this level before
in a child or in an adult.

34:24.340 --> 34:26.206
I knew, eventually,
people would come after her.

34:26.242 --> 34:27.876
Like they did with you.

34:27.909 --> 34:29.378
If the NSA
found out about Zoe,

34:29.411 --> 34:30.746
do you think they'd
let me keep her?

34:30.780 --> 34:35.050
They'd turn her
into a lab rat or worse.

34:35.083 --> 34:37.185
So I gave her
to my Uncle Wesley

34:37.219 --> 34:39.853
to take care of.

34:39.888 --> 34:42.223
So it was Zoe who created
the super inscription

34:42.257 --> 34:43.925
and enabled you to talk
back and forth

34:43.958 --> 34:45.592
without anybody else
knowing, hmm?

34:45.627 --> 34:48.362
That's astonishing.

34:48.397 --> 34:50.264
She's a second generation
Alpha.

35:05.915 --> 35:07.715
You gonna answer that?

35:07.750 --> 35:12.086
No. It's Sullivan.

35:12.121 --> 35:13.655
So what happens now?

35:13.689 --> 35:16.924
Ah, this isn't our choice
to make, Nina.

35:16.959 --> 35:19.494
There's always a choice.

35:19.528 --> 35:21.296
If we let them
take Skylar and Zoe,

35:21.330 --> 35:22.430
then who's next.

35:22.464 --> 35:25.066
Bill, Rachel?

35:25.101 --> 35:27.735
Cameron, me?

35:27.770 --> 35:30.772
It'd be nice if we could do
exactly as we pleased,

35:30.806 --> 35:33.108
but life doesn't
work like that.

36:02.470 --> 36:04.004
She's gone, Cley.

36:04.039 --> 36:05.673
She was in the house.

36:05.707 --> 36:06.708
She was under surveillance,

36:06.742 --> 36:09.678
but...she's gone.

36:09.712 --> 36:11.680
Let me guess.

36:11.715 --> 36:13.482
She just disappeared
into thin air?

36:13.517 --> 36:14.584
She was able to put together
a device

36:14.618 --> 36:15.785
that distracted everyone.

36:15.819 --> 36:18.621
You think I'm gonna
let this slide...

36:18.656 --> 36:20.790
then you've really
misjudged me too.

36:28.565 --> 36:30.866
No, they--
they just called.

36:30.900 --> 36:33.168
No, Alan...
He's okay, thank God.

36:33.203 --> 36:35.137
I don't know
what I would have done--

36:35.171 --> 36:36.338
Hi, Mom.

36:36.372 --> 36:37.873
Uh, I gotta go.

36:39.742 --> 36:42.877
I was so worried about you.

36:42.912 --> 36:44.779
Don't you ever do that
to me again.

36:44.814 --> 36:47.783
Okay. I'm not gonna
work for Uncle Alan.

36:47.817 --> 36:49.152
I work for Dr. Rosen.

36:49.186 --> 36:50.920
- No!
- Ow.

36:50.955 --> 36:52.055
Gary, it's not safe,

36:52.089 --> 36:54.158
and I am just trying
to look out for you.

36:54.192 --> 36:56.227
Mom, li--
you listen...okay?

36:56.261 --> 36:57.929
I look out for me.

36:57.963 --> 36:59.931
And--and the team
looks out for me.

36:59.965 --> 37:01.533
They do.

37:01.567 --> 37:03.334
And the only reason
that I told you what I do

37:03.369 --> 37:04.436
is because you made me.

37:04.470 --> 37:05.971
But I shouldn't have,

37:06.005 --> 37:07.272
because it's classified,

37:07.307 --> 37:09.107
and you don't tell your mom
classified stuff.

37:09.142 --> 37:11.277
And you've always said to me...
Gary.

37:11.311 --> 37:12.745
That you want me
to grow up

37:12.779 --> 37:13.913
and to be more normal.

37:13.947 --> 37:15.080
- No, no. No.
- And to have...

37:15.115 --> 37:16.782
I never said that.
I never would say that.

37:16.816 --> 37:18.150
I said I wanted you
to be happy

37:18.184 --> 37:19.418
and safe.
Yeah, to be happy.

37:19.452 --> 37:20.552
Well, Mom...

37:20.586 --> 37:22.087
I'm a Secret Agent now.

37:22.121 --> 37:26.158
Okay? And I am happy.

37:26.192 --> 37:28.326
Okay?
Good night, mom.

37:31.363 --> 37:32.897
Good night.

37:32.931 --> 37:33.931
I love you.

37:33.966 --> 37:35.633
Yeah, I love you too, Mom.

37:39.772 --> 37:42.007
Great report.

37:42.041 --> 37:43.575
If you like fiction.

37:44.878 --> 37:46.645
It's all true.

37:46.680 --> 37:48.280
It's what you left out, Lee.

37:48.315 --> 37:50.049
Well, I'm sure
Agent Nathan Cley

37:50.083 --> 37:51.884
will be more than happy
to fill in the blanks.

37:51.919 --> 37:53.052
I'm sure he will too,

37:53.086 --> 37:54.220
considering
he's already raising hell

37:54.254 --> 37:55.621
over at the D.O.D.

37:55.656 --> 37:57.490
He does his job
and I do mine.

37:57.524 --> 37:58.624
And, as far as I'm concerned,

37:58.658 --> 38:00.092
my team takes precedent.

38:02.663 --> 38:05.931
And I make all my decisions
accordingly.

38:05.965 --> 38:08.400
Well, I guess that
just leaves me in the middle.

38:11.571 --> 38:14.674
You know what the hardest part
of my job is?

38:14.708 --> 38:16.342
Protecting your ass.

38:16.376 --> 38:18.043
And you don't make it
any easier.

38:26.320 --> 38:28.587
Ah, quantum physics
and lollipops.

38:28.622 --> 38:30.189
What could be better, hmm?

38:30.223 --> 38:32.458
- Did they buy your story?
- Uh, not really.

38:32.493 --> 38:33.726
But it all worked out.

38:33.760 --> 38:35.328
More or less.

38:36.998 --> 38:39.766
So you're dropping off
the map?

38:39.800 --> 38:41.167
As far as I can go.

38:43.204 --> 38:44.337
Oh.

38:44.371 --> 38:46.739
I made something
for Gary

38:46.774 --> 38:47.974
to make up
for zapping him.

38:48.008 --> 38:49.642
It's just a normal phone

38:49.676 --> 38:51.911
with the extra
bells and whistles.

38:51.945 --> 38:53.512
I'm sure
Gary'll be thrilled.

38:53.546 --> 38:54.813
Push the red button
six times,

38:54.848 --> 38:56.582
you'll get
a direct line to me.

38:56.616 --> 39:00.152
Hopefully, we'll talk
more than every five years.

39:02.489 --> 39:04.958
So, our agreement...

39:11.967 --> 39:15.170
It's pretty much the coolest
thing I ever built.

39:17.141 --> 39:19.109
Ah.

39:19.143 --> 39:20.476
A few modifications,

39:20.511 --> 39:23.179
I could find every Alpha
on the planet.

39:28.085 --> 39:30.186
And serve them up
to your bosses on a platter.

39:30.220 --> 39:32.221
Right.

39:51.441 --> 39:53.376
You're right.
That felt good.

40:02.154 --> 40:04.321
Cappuccino machine.
Where did this thing come from?

40:04.355 --> 40:05.823
There's no return address.

40:05.857 --> 40:07.958
It's even more complicated
than the one she broke.

40:07.992 --> 40:09.193
I'm pretty handy
with these things.

40:09.227 --> 40:11.061
Hang on.

40:11.095 --> 40:13.263
Here we go.
Excuse me, ladies.

40:13.297 --> 40:14.931
Give me a little room here.

40:16.934 --> 40:18.568
There's no buttons.
All right, hang on.

40:18.603 --> 40:20.403
Um...All right,
hang on, just--

40:20.437 --> 40:22.972
I got this.

40:23.007 --> 40:25.407
Can't push machines, Nina.

40:25.442 --> 40:27.309
Venti nonfat
double macchiato,

40:27.344 --> 40:28.944
half-caf, extra foam.

40:30.380 --> 40:32.781
Enjoy your beverage, Nina.

40:35.185 --> 40:36.919
- Thank you very much.
- Mm-hmm.

40:36.953 --> 40:38.120
Bye.

40:38.155 --> 40:40.089
I wonder if it could
give me advice on men.

40:40.124 --> 40:41.424
Oh! There's a joke.

40:41.459 --> 40:42.892
Bill said,
you like your coffee

40:42.926 --> 40:44.460
like you like your--
your--

40:44.495 --> 40:46.396
- mm. Men.
- Men.

40:46.430 --> 40:48.364
It's an inappropriate
joke, Gary.

40:48.399 --> 40:49.432
Bill said women.

40:59.210 --> 41:00.877
Hey, you--
do you know it's rude

41:00.912 --> 41:02.746
to read
other people's mail?

41:02.781 --> 41:03.981
- Thank you.
- Bill...

41:04.015 --> 41:05.349
No.

41:05.383 --> 41:07.251
I'm not promising anything.

41:17.029 --> 41:20.165
♪ "P" equals "X" minus one ♪

41:20.199 --> 41:21.800
♪ over PX ♪

41:21.835 --> 41:25.371
♪ minus one ♪

41:25.405 --> 41:28.707
♪ if each coefficient
is an integer ♪

41:28.742 --> 41:32.011
♪ where P's
not divisible by "X" ♪
