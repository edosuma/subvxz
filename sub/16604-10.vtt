10:07.802 --> 10:09.402
Oh, she can keep her lying
Russian ass over that bar.

10:09.437 --> 10:10.570
I don't want her back in this house.

10:10.605 --> 10:13.172
- Then we'll go to The Alibi.
- I want to stab her fucking heart out

10:13.207 --> 10:14.540
Right. I'll go alone.

10:14.576 --> 10:16.542
[indistinct chatter]

10:22.150 --> 10:25.718
[sighs] Hi.

10:25.753 --> 10:26.886
Chad said you wanted to see me?

10:26.921 --> 10:28.521
Yeah, sit down.

10:28.556 --> 10:30.010
[man] Order up!

10:30.758 --> 10:32.058
Everything okay?

10:32.093 --> 10:34.427
Morning, boss, and, boss.

10:34.462 --> 10:36.656
- Coffee?
- Uh, no, thanks.

10:36.681 --> 10:38.810
- You can top her off though.
- Hmm.

10:43.004 --> 10:45.871
You bought Wendell's Wash N Dry.

10:45.907 --> 10:48.274
How's it going for you?

10:48.309 --> 10:50.109
Why, it's really starting to pick up,

10:50.144 --> 10:52.578
but-but I'm able to balance
it with my job here at Patsy's.

10:52.614 --> 10:55.481
Relax, Gallagher, I'm not firing you.

10:55.516 --> 10:57.717
I want to buy you out of that lease.

10:57.752 --> 10:59.118
What?

10:59.388 --> 11:00.721
Y-you want to buy Wendell's?

11:00.748 --> 11:02.381
I own the building.

11:02.417 --> 11:06.018
And I'm absorbing all
the outstanding leases.

11:06.054 --> 11:07.453
I just bought it.

11:07.488 --> 11:09.388
And I will give you 80,000 for it.

11:09.424 --> 11:11.190
Just to take it off your hands.

11:11.226 --> 11:12.825
'Cause public records show
that's what you paid for it.

11:12.861 --> 11:14.560
Yeah, I-I mean, put a lot of money

11:14.596 --> 11:16.195
into turning it around.

11:16.231 --> 11:18.197
And I promised the woman
that I bought it from

11:18.233 --> 11:19.866
that she could keep living
in her place upstairs.

11:19.901 --> 11:22.301
She's been there since the '60s.

11:22.337 --> 11:24.337
Ninety-thousand.

11:24.372 --> 11:26.197
Well, I really appreciate this offer...

11:26.222 --> 11:28.267
And you don't have to answer today.

11:28.543 --> 11:30.142
Tomorrow will be fine.

11:30.211 --> 11:32.345
So, uh, I will see you

11:32.380 --> 11:34.580
here tomorrow at, shall we say,

11:34.616 --> 11:37.183
nine o'clock?

11:37.218 --> 11:39.585
It's $10,000 profit.

11:39.621 --> 11:42.486
And that will save you the grief
from having to run that dump.

11:48.563 --> 11:49.795
"Dump"?

12:01.743 --> 12:03.542
- Ow.
- [cell phone clatters]

12:03.569 --> 12:05.602
Dude, what the fuck?

12:05.647 --> 12:07.586
[cell phone rings]

12:17.443 --> 12:18.758
[Mickey] <i> Miss me?</i>

12:18.793 --> 12:19.935
Mickey.

12:21.930 --> 12:23.536
Where are you?

12:23.561 --> 12:25.318
[Mickey] <i> Meet me at the
south shore docks in an hour.</i>

12:25.343 --> 12:26.543
<i>Drop the phone in a sewer.</i>

12:26.568 --> 12:27.857
[line disconnects]

12:36.844 --> 12:37.944
[cell phone clatters]

12:37.979 --> 12:41.280
[indistinct TV chatter]

12:41.316 --> 12:43.382
We figured it out.

12:43.418 --> 12:45.117
The adoption papers thing?

12:45.153 --> 12:47.153
- Pretty tricky stuff.
- Hmm.

12:47.188 --> 12:49.488
And I slept in shit room
upstairs like you asked.

12:49.524 --> 12:50.723
Now can we be a thrupple again?

12:50.758 --> 12:52.158
Uh, pretty sure that's a no

12:52.193 --> 12:53.893
since you betrayed us and stole our bar.

12:53.928 --> 12:55.127
It is not betrayal.

12:55.163 --> 12:57.563
I am superior manager at Alibi.

12:57.598 --> 12:59.112
It should be in my name, not yours.

12:59.137 --> 13:00.166
This is not news.

13:00.222 --> 13:01.500
Oh, yeah?

13:01.536 --> 13:03.069
Then why'd you do it behind our backs?

13:03.104 --> 13:06.505
It's simple. You would try to stop me.

13:06.541 --> 13:08.741
Good point. Still shitty.

13:08.776 --> 13:12.511
The way you run bar, we
are bankrupt in six months.

13:12.547 --> 13:15.815
You are big, lovable poppa,
but you are stupid manager.

13:15.850 --> 13:17.316
I save us.

13:17.352 --> 13:18.784
Now weave money for our family.

13:18.820 --> 13:21.187
Well, we want it back.
And I'm not stupid.

13:21.222 --> 13:22.621
You didn't know the difference between

13:22.657 --> 13:24.590
adoption papers and sales documents.

13:24.625 --> 13:26.826
Wordy stuff confuses me,
and it's not the same.

13:26.861 --> 13:28.861
And taking our bar is way
worse than being stupid.

13:28.896 --> 13:31.130
It's cunty.

13:31.165 --> 13:33.432
Overdraft charges on many checks,

13:33.468 --> 13:36.035
penalties for late taxes, no insurance,

13:36.070 --> 13:38.838
distributors overcharging for alcohol?

13:38.873 --> 13:40.673
Stupid.

13:40.708 --> 13:42.274
V was in love with you.

13:42.310 --> 13:44.143
And nobody breaks her heart but me.

13:44.145 --> 13:45.845
Except I don't break her heart.

13:45.880 --> 13:47.213
So that leaves nobody.

13:47.248 --> 13:49.286
Taking the bar is not about love.

13:49.311 --> 13:52.118
You tell V to stay in
thrupple, everything is fine.

13:52.153 --> 13:55.521
I handle money. Family remains safe.

13:55.556 --> 13:57.189
And what if we don't
stay in the thrupple?

13:57.225 --> 13:59.859
Eh, this is not better option.

13:59.894 --> 14:03.396
And now there's no deed.

14:03.431 --> 14:05.231
This is only a copy.

14:05.266 --> 14:08.067
I filed paperwork with
county clerk and IRS.

14:08.102 --> 14:10.336
Damn it.

14:10.371 --> 14:11.871
Big Poppa...

14:11.906 --> 14:13.706
Don't call me that. It's creepy now.

14:13.741 --> 14:14.907
Nothing has to change.

14:16.611 --> 14:18.711
I still love V. I still fuck you.

14:18.746 --> 14:21.180
Do not ruin life for one small thing.

14:22.850 --> 14:24.798
[machines whirring]

14:24.823 --> 14:26.478
[sighs] Hey.

14:26.503 --> 14:28.478
She's about to nap for an
hour, so what can I tackle?

14:28.503 --> 14:30.603
You think this place
still looks like a dump?

14:30.628 --> 14:33.159
I could maybe hang up a
few posters or something.

14:33.194 --> 14:34.760
But I was only planning to do laundry.

14:34.796 --> 14:36.150
Nah, just help me fold this stuff.

14:36.173 --> 14:37.372
I gotta take food up to Etta.

14:37.408 --> 14:39.134
Yeah, sure.

14:39.977 --> 14:41.176
You talking to Monica yet?

14:41.212 --> 14:43.812
No way. I stay clear of disasters.

14:43.848 --> 14:46.215
Her and Frank are
staying with me for a bit.

14:46.250 --> 14:47.478
Getting crowded.

14:47.503 --> 14:49.562
You still marrying Neil even
though you got Franny back?

14:49.587 --> 14:51.687
Why wouldn't I? We're in love.

14:51.722 --> 14:53.989
And please don't call it a
scam like Frank and Monica.

14:54.024 --> 14:56.124
No, of course not.

14:56.160 --> 14:58.026
[Nona] This where we drop off our duds?

14:58.062 --> 14:59.661
Yeah, just on the scale.

14:59.697 --> 15:00.996
Like a donut?

15:01.031 --> 15:02.331
Complimentary.

15:02.366 --> 15:04.299
Our happy hour wash starts today.

15:04.335 --> 15:06.001
There's a DJ, comes in at 5 p.m.

15:06.036 --> 15:07.636
You can pick up your
load while listening

15:07.671 --> 15:09.171
to hip-hop and house music.

15:09.206 --> 15:10.806
It's just a laundromat, right?

15:10.841 --> 15:12.474
[Debbie] Kay, 18 pounds

15:12.509 --> 15:15.939
at 75¢ a pound, that
will be $13.50, please.

15:15.964 --> 15:17.145
[Nona] Here you go.

15:17.181 --> 15:18.881
Have a good day.

15:18.916 --> 15:20.415
Hey, uh,

15:20.451 --> 15:22.417
you overcharged her. It's 50¢ a pound.

15:22.453 --> 15:24.586
- Sign's in the window.
- I took that sign down.

15:24.622 --> 15:25.921
50¢ a pound is low.

15:25.963 --> 15:28.323
As long as it's under a dollar,
nobody really does the math

15:28.359 --> 15:30.492
and we increase profits by 50%.

15:30.527 --> 15:31.839
Smart.

15:31.864 --> 15:34.665
Glad you're working for
me, not the competition.

15:34.690 --> 15:37.691
[pop music plays over speakers]

15:41.739 --> 15:43.605
Your dude looks like hell.

15:43.641 --> 15:45.540
Not my dude.

15:45.576 --> 15:47.109
[bell dings]

15:57.149 --> 15:59.416
[pans clattering]

15:59.441 --> 16:01.151
[glass shatters]

16:01.175 --> 16:02.355
Shit!

16:03.727 --> 16:07.095
Ow, fff-fuck!

16:07.131 --> 16:09.197
[bell dings]

16:09.233 --> 16:11.433
Hey, we got a first aid
kit or something over here?

16:11.468 --> 16:13.268
Behind you on the wall.

16:13.304 --> 16:14.534
Thanks.

16:16.173 --> 16:17.973
Oh.

16:18.008 --> 16:19.775
Sss-shit!

16:23.113 --> 16:24.792
Thank you.

16:24.817 --> 16:26.987
Rough night?

16:27.484 --> 16:29.985
- That's a massive understatement.
- [bell dings]

16:32.189 --> 16:34.589
You, uh, you got anything?

16:34.625 --> 16:36.491
You got any Adderall or weed?

16:36.527 --> 16:38.327
Um...

16:38.362 --> 16:39.628
let me check my purse.

16:39.663 --> 16:40.941
Thanks.

16:46.804 --> 16:48.637
Dude's barely hanging on.

16:48.672 --> 16:51.173
Should we say something?

16:51.208 --> 16:52.507
[exhales]

16:52.543 --> 16:53.976
I can't.

16:54.011 --> 16:56.044
Uh, but his sister should probably know.

16:58.649 --> 17:00.869
Morning, Etta. You hungry?

17:00.894 --> 17:02.611
Got your favorite donuts from Patsy's.

17:02.636 --> 17:04.344
Ate breakfast already.

17:04.368 --> 17:05.420
[cat meows]

17:05.455 --> 17:07.455
No. Remember what I said?

17:07.491 --> 17:09.090
No more cat food.

17:09.126 --> 17:11.827
Look, you got to get your
breakfast from the fridge

17:11.862 --> 17:13.742
or from the cabinet from now on.

17:13.768 --> 17:14.863
Food is food.

17:14.897 --> 17:16.531
[sir wailing distantly]

17:16.567 --> 17:18.800
You know, it's the third time those cops

17:18.836 --> 17:20.669
drove down this block.

17:20.704 --> 17:22.637
Some fuckery's going on.

17:22.673 --> 17:24.205
Must be the Italians.

17:24.241 --> 17:26.208
Think they're looking
for Mickey Milkovich.

17:26.242 --> 17:27.776
He escaped from prison.

17:27.810 --> 17:28.944
You remember him, from the neighborhood?

17:28.979 --> 17:30.612
Milkoviches?

17:30.647 --> 17:33.482
I think one of 'em robbed us in '88.

17:33.517 --> 17:34.983
[soft chuckle]

17:35.019 --> 17:36.318
You know, I'm hungry.

17:36.353 --> 17:38.020
What's for breakfast?

17:38.055 --> 17:39.788
We're gonna be playing
hip-hop and house music

17:39.823 --> 17:41.823
at the Mat tonight, so
remember to wear your earplugs.

17:41.859 --> 17:43.604
You wear your earplugs.

17:43.629 --> 17:45.193
I'm coming to the party.

17:45.229 --> 17:47.829
Gets pretty busy after 7 p.m.

17:47.865 --> 17:50.298
Me and Wendell used to throw parties.

17:50.334 --> 17:52.467
[chuckles] Oh, Howlin' Wolf

17:52.503 --> 17:55.737
once ate dinner right
at our dining table.

17:55.773 --> 17:58.807
He was the blues fella
with the deep voice.

17:58.842 --> 18:00.809
Well, it's not gonna be blues music,

18:00.844 --> 18:02.844
but you're more than
welcome to come down.

18:02.880 --> 18:04.713
I'll make sure nobody
sits in your chair.

18:04.748 --> 18:07.749
Oh, and if the cops
pick up the Milkoviches,

18:07.785 --> 18:10.018
tell 'em we want our VCR back.

18:10.020 --> 18:12.220
[snickers] Will do.

18:12.256 --> 18:14.122
[cell phone chimes]

18:16.710 --> 18:18.498
_

18:20.364 --> 18:22.697
Evidence room's 203.

18:22.733 --> 18:26.201
Isn't that kind of... right in
the middle of the police station?

18:26.236 --> 18:27.951
[exhales] Okay. Matches.

18:27.976 --> 18:29.037
- Yeah.
- Fireworks.

18:29.073 --> 18:30.839
Partner creates a distraction

18:30.874 --> 18:32.340
by stripping naked in the hallway

18:32.376 --> 18:33.842
and setting his clothes on fire.

18:33.877 --> 18:35.544
Then when the guard leaves his station,

18:35.579 --> 18:36.711
the other one slips in.

18:36.747 --> 18:39.114
This plan feels a little sketchy.

18:39.149 --> 18:40.715
Which one of us is gonna streak?

18:40.751 --> 18:42.551
- You?
- You're faster.

18:42.586 --> 18:44.219
But you look better naked.

18:44.254 --> 18:46.621
A'ight, we'll flip a coin inside.

18:46.657 --> 18:47.956
Thank you.

18:47.991 --> 18:50.625
I'm gonna need two hits for this.

18:50.661 --> 18:52.761
[sniffs twice] Ah!

18:55.099 --> 18:56.932
Ready, Clyde?

18:56.967 --> 18:58.333
Let's roll, Bonnie.

18:59.856 --> 19:02.370
Am I happy to see you today, Gallagher.

19:02.406 --> 19:04.072
I need a break from those rookies.

19:04.108 --> 19:07.356
Been a long night of training
a bunch of uninspired dipshits.

19:10.581 --> 19:12.314
You good?

19:12.349 --> 19:14.282
Yeah. Yeah.

19:14.318 --> 19:15.951
Crazy morning.

19:18.522 --> 19:19.788
You, uh, working a double?

19:19.823 --> 19:21.957
Paying for my daughter's senior year.

19:21.992 --> 19:23.325
Fuck prom.

19:23.360 --> 19:25.327
I'm recommending you to train next time.

19:25.362 --> 19:26.928
You could do these in your
sleep, plus, it'll look

19:26.964 --> 19:28.930
really good on your record
if you ever want to advance.

19:28.966 --> 19:30.398
- [alarm chimes]
- Cool, thanks.

19:30.434 --> 19:32.100
- Oh, okay.
- [indistinct PA announcement]

19:32.136 --> 19:33.702
Let's ride.

19:47.217 --> 19:49.684
I'm not feeling good.

19:49.720 --> 19:51.186
Are you fucking shitting me?

19:51.221 --> 19:52.187
You're sick?

19:52.222 --> 19:53.688
[retches]

19:53.724 --> 19:55.257
- Think I'm gonna puke.
- Just go.

19:55.292 --> 19:56.825
