00:24.733 --> 00:29.154
Dr. Martin Luther King observed
that there is democracy in death.

00:30.989 --> 00:31.990
We all die…

00:33.492 --> 00:35.202
whether we're old or young,

00:36.620 --> 00:38.038
rich or poor,

00:39.498 --> 00:40.749
innocent or guilty.

00:43.126 --> 00:44.795
But we need not despair.

00:45.838 --> 00:47.923
Because death is not the end.

00:49.967 --> 00:51.468
It's only the beginning.

00:57.391 --> 01:01.478
Commander Kuznetsov,
if you'd like to say anything?

01:04.815 --> 01:09.236
Grief, though it is difficult,
can also be a gift.

01:09.820 --> 01:13.031
Yes, we have lost Oleg Sidorov's body,

01:13.907 --> 01:18.245
but we have what he has left behind
to mark our loss.

01:20.247 --> 01:24.001
And now we have been granted
this moment to say,

01:25.460 --> 01:26.461
"Goodbye.

01:29.381 --> 01:34.386
Farewell, dear comrade. Farewell."

01:36.221 --> 01:40.893
As you take your final journey…

01:42.019 --> 01:46.815
our hearts go with you.

03:40.721 --> 03:44.558
…and honor the sacrifice
of three brave souls.

03:44.641 --> 03:46.185
It is with profound sorrow that we…

03:46.268 --> 03:47.728
In a somber ceremony,

03:47.811 --> 03:50.105
President Wilson led the nation,
and the world,

03:50.189 --> 03:52.608
in mourning those who were lost
during the rescue.

03:53.358 --> 03:56.653
Representatives of
the Soviet space agency, Roscosmos,

03:56.737 --> 03:58.530
are arriving in Houston today

03:58.614 --> 04:01.533
to work with NASA
on their now-combined mission

04:01.617 --> 04:05.037
as the former rivals have become
unexpected partners.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.553
Welcome to Johnson Space Center,
Director Catiche.

04:21.637 --> 04:22.638
Thank you, Margo.

04:29.394 --> 04:31.438
I think we can make a lot of this work.

04:32.022 --> 04:36.193
There is another issue
that is not in these official proposals,

04:36.276 --> 04:37.736
with which we will need your help.

04:37.819 --> 04:39.863
Outside of normal channels.

04:47.287 --> 04:48.830
And what would that be?

04:50.123 --> 04:54.378
Well, once our two countries land
together on Mars,

04:54.461 --> 04:59.049
we want for our cosmonauts to resume
some of their original mission objectives.

04:59.883 --> 05:03.720
But to do so, we will need to utilize
some of your resources.

05:04.221 --> 05:07.808
Drones, rovers, laboratory equipment,

05:07.891 --> 05:10.185
perhaps re-tasking a satellite or two.

05:14.398 --> 05:17.150
What exactly are these mission objectives?

05:19.236 --> 05:22.531
I am unfortunately not at liberty to say.

05:23.031 --> 05:26.118
Nonetheless,
we will require your assistance.

05:26.201 --> 05:32.291
We have seen how cooperative you can be
under the most difficult circumstances.

05:42.301 --> 05:43.385
I was told--

05:45.721 --> 05:49.933
I was assured that there would be
no more requests.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.562
Circumstances have changed.

06:18.420 --> 06:19.421
Okay.

06:21.798 --> 06:24.343
You want my help,
you're gonna have to help me.

06:24.426 --> 06:25.427
I'm listening.

06:26.261 --> 06:27.804
Sergei Nikulov.

06:29.473 --> 06:31.433
I will work with him and only him.

06:34.228 --> 06:37.981
Margo, you have to know
this is not possible.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.734
Why? What happened to him?

06:40.817 --> 06:42.986
Why have I been unable to reach him?

06:45.155 --> 06:48.367
He was the director of Roscosmos
for over ten years--

06:48.450 --> 06:49.576
your mentor,

06:49.660 --> 06:52.412
the reason you even have a Mars program.

06:53.288 --> 06:54.915
And then he just disappears?

06:55.874 --> 06:57.751
He was given another assignment.

07:01.713 --> 07:03.090
Bullshit.

07:03.173 --> 07:04.716
Margo, I really cannot…

07:04.800 --> 07:06.760
-Okay, here's the deal, Lenara.
-…have this discussion with you.

07:07.511 --> 07:09.179
If you want my help,

07:09.263 --> 07:14.643
then I want Sergei here in Houston
in two weeks or less.

07:14.726 --> 07:17.688
Otherwise, no satellites,
no equipment, nothing.

07:29.241 --> 07:31.660
-Okay, Louisa. Hit it.
-Executing now.

07:33.620 --> 07:35.706
Good. Good. Go ahead, Danny. Kill it.

07:40.127 --> 07:41.253
How are we doing?

07:41.336 --> 07:44.047
Well, 200th time's the charm.
Right, Skipper?

07:46.633 --> 07:49.553
-Just lost my nav screen.
-Propulsion control is dead.

07:50.804 --> 07:51.805
And?

07:53.265 --> 07:54.391
And?

08:00.898 --> 08:02.274
Propulsion's coming back.

08:02.941 --> 08:04.860
-Nav's reloaded.
-We're in control, sir.

08:04.943 --> 08:06.361
Ship is back in our hands.

08:06.862 --> 08:09.823
Good. How do we make sure
it doesn't happen again?

08:09.907 --> 08:13.744
Well, I fooled the computer into thinking
Dev's new system was corrupt.

08:13.827 --> 08:17.122
So, we installed the older backup version
when we went into safe mode.

08:17.206 --> 08:19.416
Which doesn't have Dev's overrides.

08:19.499 --> 08:22.753
Exactly. I also cut the command uplink
receiver line to the antenna.

08:22.836 --> 08:25.380
-Right, so we're good?
-Yeah. Yes, sir.

08:25.464 --> 08:28.550
Okay. Let's go to Mars, people.

08:29.676 --> 08:31.929
But first, I gotta send a message.

08:36.390 --> 08:38.059
Message coming in from Phoenix.

08:38.143 --> 08:39.394
Patching it in onto the board.

08:40.102 --> 08:44.316
Dev, as I'm sure you've realized,
I have retaken control of my ship.

08:46.401 --> 08:49.154
From now on, I'm calling the shots.

08:49.780 --> 08:53.867
You've dishonored this crew,
this ship, and Helios.

08:54.743 --> 08:59.331
I intend to wash that stain clean.
Phoenix out.

09:22.729 --> 09:26.733
We said we have landing sites C, A, B.

09:27.651 --> 09:28.819
All right. And once they land,

09:28.902 --> 09:31.947
it's imperative that the camera
be positioned from two different angles

09:32.030 --> 09:33.115
to maximize the--

09:37.786 --> 09:39.037
Karen, hold on a second.

09:42.040 --> 09:43.166
Will you excuse us?

09:54.219 --> 09:55.470
You wanna resign?

09:55.554 --> 09:57.472
Yeah. Ed was right.

09:57.556 --> 09:59.099
You should have let 'em
rescue the Russians.

09:59.183 --> 10:01.018
It was the group's decision.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.562
Don't.
You orchestrated that entire decision.

10:03.645 --> 10:05.439
I asked for everybody's opinion.

10:05.522 --> 10:07.608
Yes, and everybody in that room
worships you.

10:07.691 --> 10:10.110
So all you had to do was telegraph
the decision that you wanted

10:10.194 --> 10:11.195
and they just delivered it.

10:11.278 --> 10:13.739
So now I'm some kind of Svengali
with supernatural mind control powers.

10:13.822 --> 10:14.823
Pretty much.

10:14.907 --> 10:17.492
My daughter is on Sojourner,
and she could have been killed.

10:17.576 --> 10:19.995
-But she wasn't.
-Three other people were.

10:20.078 --> 10:23.999
And those people have mothers and fathers
and children who are now heartbroken,

10:24.082 --> 10:26.460
trying to figure out how
they're gonna find the strength to go on.

10:26.543 --> 10:28.003
And I feel bad for them. I do.

10:28.086 --> 10:29.338
-Really?
-Absolutely.

10:29.421 --> 10:32.382
But I didn't ask anybody
to move their launches up to '94.

10:32.466 --> 10:35.928
And I didn't ask the Russians
to push their engines past their limits.

10:40.432 --> 10:41.892
I'm not letting you quit.

10:41.975 --> 10:43.602
No? Watch me.

10:45.729 --> 10:47.898
-You're in breach of contract.
-So sue me.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.320
Karen. Karen, let's talk about this.

10:54.655 --> 10:55.656
Karen.

11:00.911 --> 11:02.913
Propellant transfer nearly complete.

11:13.257 --> 11:14.800
Tank pressure nominal.

11:15.300 --> 11:18.512
I'm still impressed Star City could
remotely stabilize your ship.

11:18.595 --> 11:22.224
I am impressed as well
with how you maneuver in this device.

11:22.307 --> 11:25.060
Float like a butterfly, sting like a bee.

11:39.366 --> 11:40.409
Shit.

11:41.910 --> 11:42.911
What's problem?

11:46.582 --> 11:49.209
I can help. It's no problem.

11:57.759 --> 11:58.844
No.

12:00.053 --> 12:01.054
Thank you.

12:04.641 --> 12:05.851
What for?

12:07.102 --> 12:08.437
For coming to our rescue.

12:12.691 --> 12:15.944
I can't wait to hear
what song you play next.

12:19.114 --> 12:21.366
It was you who called.

12:23.035 --> 12:24.411
I won't tell anyone.

12:26.121 --> 12:27.414
Promise.

13:11.416 --> 13:16.171
Surprise! It's me,
home from Rice for the weekend.

13:16.255 --> 13:19.174
Dad's still at work. I miss you.

13:19.967 --> 13:21.009
Yeah, I said it.

13:22.469 --> 13:25.138
Dad says you're having
a real tough time up there.

13:25.222 --> 13:28.559
And I was remembering the first time
I took the SATs and did so terrible.

13:28.642 --> 13:29.726
Remember?

13:30.769 --> 13:32.771
I thought I was never gonna
get into college,

13:32.855 --> 13:35.524
and I was gonna work at Pizza Hut
my whole life.

13:36.817 --> 13:38.193
And I was sulking in my room,

13:38.277 --> 13:41.655
and then you came in and you told me
that "That's in the past.

13:43.031 --> 13:44.449
Focus on what you can do now."

13:45.993 --> 13:47.452
It was good advice.

13:47.995 --> 13:49.121
Anyways…

13:50.747 --> 13:53.375
I love you. Stay strong.

15:03.820 --> 15:05.447
Once is happenstance.

15:12.037 --> 15:13.747
Twice is coincidence.

15:22.172 --> 15:23.715
Three times is enemy action.

15:34.935 --> 15:38.480
Margo,
those Russian pricks stole my design.

15:40.649 --> 15:42.317
Keep your voice down.

16:06.466 --> 16:09.094
It's not unusual
that they came up with similar solutions

16:09.178 --> 16:10.637
for a nuclear-thermal engine.

16:12.389 --> 16:13.390
Similar.

16:14.391 --> 16:18.187
Margo, these expansion ratios match
within .3%.

16:20.439 --> 16:22.733
Look, we should've known
the second we could refuel.

16:23.317 --> 16:26.862
Their LH2 drain coupling mated exactly
with our in situ propellant hose.

16:26.945 --> 16:31.158
The odds of that being a coincidence
are insane.

16:31.241 --> 16:32.618
What are you telling me?

16:33.410 --> 16:35.579
I should walk down there to Miss Catiche

16:35.662 --> 16:39.458
and throw a monkey wrench into
a historic international space mission

16:39.541 --> 16:42.127
because of some measurements
you took off a TV screen?

16:43.504 --> 16:44.796
Yeah, I would.

16:44.880 --> 16:48.842
I know you would. But I need you to focus.

16:48.926 --> 16:51.637
Sojourner is about to make the burn
for Mars.

17:15.786 --> 17:17.119
Checklist verified.

17:17.704 --> 17:22.459
Five, four, three, two.

17:22.960 --> 17:24.419
Initiate burn for Mars.

17:40.769 --> 17:44.314
Engine number one showed
a 17.2 bar drop in chamber pressure.

17:44.398 --> 17:47.359
That's not good.
Could be a turboprop malfunction.

17:47.442 --> 17:50.153
The FCC is pushing engine two harder
to compensate.

17:50.696 --> 17:53.240
Engine one might have been damaged
in the collision.

17:54.992 --> 17:56.201
Burn complete.

18:00.956 --> 18:03.876
Shutdown sequence initiated
on both main engines.

18:04.751 --> 18:06.545
Prepare to deploy the solar sail.

18:09.423 --> 18:13.969
We've got good delta-v.
We are on track for Mars.

18:14.052 --> 18:17.389
Expect orbit entry
three days after Phoenix gets there.

18:17.890 --> 18:20.893
Will, I want a full diagnostic
of engine one.

18:22.102 --> 18:25.063
We gotta get it back up to
rated thrust in order to enter Mars orbit.

18:25.147 --> 18:28.108
Do any of you have background
in nuclear thermal propulsion theory?

18:33.447 --> 18:36.325
-No.
-Then Poletov will operate the engines.

18:36.408 --> 18:37.659
He has the best Soviet training.

18:40.913 --> 18:41.914
I don't know…

18:44.291 --> 18:48.545
You'd rather fail and die, risk your crew,
than trust a Russian?

18:54.718 --> 18:58.263
Will, run Comrade Poletov
through our procedures.

18:59.097 --> 19:00.933
Baldwin has better Russian.

19:02.976 --> 19:04.144
You all right with that, Kel?

19:06.605 --> 19:07.606
Yeah.

19:10.984 --> 19:12.069
Hi, Ed.

19:16.406 --> 19:17.783
I have a lot to tell you.

19:20.369 --> 19:24.498
First, I wanna say, watching you
stand up for what was right

19:26.333 --> 19:27.960
made me so proud.

19:28.669 --> 19:32.464
It did. And-- In fact, it inspired me.

19:33.757 --> 19:35.968
I resigned from Helios.

19:36.885 --> 19:40.639
Yep. I am officially unemployed again.

20:22.514 --> 20:23.515
Hey, Nick.

20:24.516 --> 20:26.268
Hey. Hey, Danny.

20:27.895 --> 20:30.439
Some real whiz-bang computer geeking
you pulled off last week.

20:32.983 --> 20:33.984
Thanks.

20:35.068 --> 20:38.572
Yeah, didn't much like having guys
40 million miles away steering our ship.

20:39.198 --> 20:41.491
No. It definitely kinda ruins the whole…

20:42.284 --> 20:44.786
"master of our fate" type thing.

20:47.789 --> 20:49.249
How'd you finally get past Dev's lockout?

20:52.753 --> 20:55.339
Well, basically I kept giving
the flight control computer

20:55.422 --> 20:58.800
things that can choke it
like recursive Fibonacci calculations

20:58.884 --> 21:01.678
until it locked up
and then rebooted in safe mode.

21:01.762 --> 21:03.889
But you still had to get past security,
didn't you?

21:03.972 --> 21:07.476
Well-- Okay, so that's the fun part.
So, safe mode has a back door

21:07.559 --> 21:10.312
which allows everything to run
on the password you used at launch.

21:10.395 --> 21:12.898
-Which was?
-Rainbow.

21:13.815 --> 21:16.860
Rainbow. Great. Nice, Nick.

21:59.611 --> 22:00.904
Hi, Ed.

22:03.365 --> 22:05.033
My goodness, I have a lot to tell you.

22:06.952 --> 22:10.747
First, I wanna say,

22:11.456 --> 22:14.001
watching you stand up for what was right

22:15.669 --> 22:17.129
made me so proud.

22:17.212 --> 22:19.882
It did. In fact, it inspired me.

22:20.424 --> 22:22.718
I resigned from Helios.

22:22.801 --> 22:26.555
Yep. I am officially unemployed again.

22:27.764 --> 22:30.601
I'm not quite sure what I'm going to do.

22:30.684 --> 22:33.020
I just, you know,
pulled another Ed Baldwin.

22:33.103 --> 22:37.107
I leapt first,
and I'll figure out the rest later.

22:38.609 --> 22:41.361
I have to say, it is liberating.

23:00.672 --> 23:04.259
Then during thrust buildup in retreat,
ensure CTRR does not exceed 100,

23:04.343 --> 23:05.844
plus or minus 15 kelvin.

23:05.928 --> 23:09.515
Why does she talk so fast?
I get everything up to CTRR.

23:09.598 --> 23:13.310
It's short
for chamber temperature ramp rate.

23:17.856 --> 23:20.692
You know, your NERVA is very similar
to our Russian engines

23:20.776 --> 23:22.611
once you get past this terrible--

23:25.447 --> 23:26.782
Where did you learn Russian?

23:27.616 --> 23:30.786
Annapolis. Where did you learn English?

23:37.876 --> 23:40.295
"I'm expressing with my full capabilities

23:40.379 --> 23:42.756
and now I'm living
in correctional facilities,

23:42.840 --> 23:45.133
'cause some don't agree
with how I do this,

23:45.217 --> 23:47.511
I get straight, meditate…

23:48.387 --> 23:50.472
like a Buddhist."

23:50.556 --> 23:52.516
You like N.W.A?

23:52.599 --> 23:55.561
The way they use the language,
it is amazing.

23:55.644 --> 23:59.314
And they paint very vivid picture
of life in America.

23:59.398 --> 24:00.399
Have you been to Compton?

24:01.692 --> 24:04.987
That is where people of color live, no?
In the ghettos.

24:06.280 --> 24:09.157
I'm a person of color,
and I don't live in a ghetto.

24:09.241 --> 24:11.034
You're from Vietnam.

24:12.119 --> 24:14.746
Yes. But I left when I was very young.

24:14.830 --> 24:15.998
You should go back one day,

24:16.081 --> 24:18.458
see how a Marxist society
takes care of its citizens.

24:18.542 --> 24:19.877
There are no poor people there.

24:20.460 --> 24:22.087
Maybe because they were all killed.

24:23.463 --> 24:25.132
You get this from your father?

24:25.215 --> 24:27.926
-No, I get it from history books.
-Yes, but those books were written by--

24:28.010 --> 24:31.555
You've got another vidmail from
your NERVA instructor, Comrade Trotsky.

25:03.337 --> 25:04.379
They're here.

25:15.390 --> 25:16.391
As promised.

25:25.984 --> 25:30.239
I am glad I was able
to clear up that little misunderstanding

25:30.322 --> 25:33.784
about your security clearance, comrade.

25:34.618 --> 25:36.620
Give us the room, Lenara.

25:37.329 --> 25:38.330
I wasn't--

25:41.750 --> 25:42.835
Five minutes.

25:48.131 --> 25:49.466
I will be right outside.

26:01.770 --> 26:03.021
Are you okay?

26:04.356 --> 26:05.774
Okay, yes.

26:38.432 --> 26:41.643
When they told me you were replaced
as director of Roscosmos,

26:41.727 --> 26:43.604
I tried to get ahold of you.

26:44.354 --> 26:47.733
You just disappeared.
No one would tell me where you were.

26:49.234 --> 26:50.402
Lefortovo.

26:50.986 --> 26:52.529
The KGB prison?

26:54.406 --> 26:55.741
Christ.

26:55.824 --> 27:00.871
They discovered I had been giving you
more information than was permitted.

27:00.954 --> 27:03.832
And then, after London,

27:05.584 --> 27:06.835
I refused to…

27:08.420 --> 27:09.713
to continue with--

27:11.882 --> 27:13.050
Sorry.

27:21.433 --> 27:22.434
Thank you.

27:31.193 --> 27:32.236
Ah. Thank you.

27:38.492 --> 27:43.163
Were they-- I mean, did they--

27:43.997 --> 27:45.040
Yes.

27:45.749 --> 27:50.295
But they did it very intelligently.
Without anger, you know?

27:50.379 --> 27:55.259
They were very careful
not to break my nose, my teeth.

27:55.884 --> 27:58.053
Instead, they work on my lungs…

27:59.930 --> 28:01.056
kidneys…

28:02.432 --> 28:07.229
I thought that kind of thing ended
when Gorbachev came to power?

28:07.312 --> 28:10.190
Not even Gorbachev can control the KGB.

28:10.274 --> 28:13.235
It's like trying to keep
a rabid dog on a leash.

28:23.620 --> 28:26.874
Margo. I'm so sorry for what I--

28:28.917 --> 28:30.252
I didn't know what to do.

28:32.504 --> 28:34.590
I tried to hold them off,

28:34.673 --> 28:38.552
but they threatened my father,
my mother, my sisters.

28:38.635 --> 28:40.053
I could not escape.

28:45.559 --> 28:46.768
I lied to you.

28:46.852 --> 28:49.855
You did. And I was very angry.

28:51.273 --> 28:54.818
I still am.
But I know it was your only choice.

28:59.114 --> 29:00.115
I'm sorry.

29:05.120 --> 29:07.664
And now, you're gonna help me.

29:07.748 --> 29:11.210
I'm gonna get us out of this, Sergei,
both of us.

29:11.293 --> 29:13.337
They've had us under their thumb
for long enough.

29:13.420 --> 29:16.006
I'm gonna talk to the right people
and get you asylum.

29:16.089 --> 29:18.050
No, no. Margo, no.

29:18.133 --> 29:22.346
No. The--
The KGB will retaliate against my family.

29:22.846 --> 29:26.016
You don't know what they are-- Sorry.

29:26.099 --> 29:28.602
You can't go back there,
not after what they did.

29:42.824 --> 29:46.495
Helios control, Phoenix.
MOI burn complete.

29:47.037 --> 29:48.997
Phoenix has now entered Mars orbit.

29:52.835 --> 29:55.838
We are on schedule for
our first landing attempt in a few hours.

29:55.921 --> 29:57.589
They're in a stable orbit.

29:57.673 --> 30:01.927
NASA is still days behind us. Phoenix out.

30:03.804 --> 30:06.890
All right.
Let's get Popeye spun up for descent.

30:06.974 --> 30:10.143
I got a wrinkle for you, Cap.

30:10.227 --> 30:13.230
That dust storm we've been tracking
has gotten even bigger.

30:13.313 --> 30:14.523
A real lulu.

30:15.566 --> 30:17.109
How bad are things at our landing site?

30:17.192 --> 30:19.987
Visibility is less than ten meters
across the entire region.

30:20.070 --> 30:21.113
And their forecast?

30:21.196 --> 30:24.324
More of the same,
at the alternate landing sites too.

30:24.950 --> 30:26.243
All we can do is wait it out.

30:39.047 --> 30:40.299
Goddamn it!

30:40.883 --> 30:42.259
Our landing got delayed.

30:46.013 --> 30:47.014
Sucks.

30:49.516 --> 30:51.268
I really want to get this one for Dad.

30:55.689 --> 30:57.608
He always regretted not landing
on Apollo 10.

30:59.902 --> 31:01.320
Remember how he used to tell us…

31:03.238 --> 31:08.911
he was so close he could just reach out
and grab a handful of moondust.

31:17.586 --> 31:19.379
Been thinking about him a lot lately.

31:26.762 --> 31:28.180
It's been harder than I thought…

31:31.183 --> 31:32.893
especially with Ed around all the time.

31:35.521 --> 31:39.733
You know, sometimes he talks about Karen,
and I feel so guilty.

31:42.277 --> 31:44.947
But then, he puts his arm around me
or calls me "kid,"

31:45.030 --> 31:47.824
and I just-- I wanna strangle him.

31:51.495 --> 31:52.996
He's got no fucking idea.

31:54.915 --> 31:57.751
Just looks at me with that big, dumb grin.

32:03.674 --> 32:06.593
I thought I'd be able to handle it,
but maybe you were right.

32:09.763 --> 32:11.265
I guess I was just hoping that--

32:12.099 --> 32:14.309
I-- I don't know…

32:17.104 --> 32:18.480
I could put it all behind me.

32:22.734 --> 32:25.654
Anyway, you don't wanna hear this shit.

32:29.700 --> 32:30.701
Do me a favor.

32:32.369 --> 32:34.830
Sneak Avery some chocolate for me
when her mom's not looking.

32:54.433 --> 32:57.144
It's ridiculous.
I have doctorate in nuclear physics.

32:57.227 --> 32:59.938
I will not be treated like a child
by an arrogant, self-taught Yankee.

33:00.022 --> 33:01.023
She's right.

33:01.106 --> 33:03.400
You need to have
these emergency procedures down.

33:03.483 --> 33:06.028
Rosales is just making sure you know,
and that we know you know.

33:06.111 --> 33:08.322
She's trying to make me look like a fool
in front of you.

33:10.073 --> 33:14.328
Why would you care what I think?
I'm just a stupid, fascist reactionary.

33:14.411 --> 33:16.747
No. Not stupid. I never said that.

33:16.830 --> 33:19.958
You are extremely bright,
beautiful, fascist reactionary.

33:20.709 --> 33:21.710
Beautiful?

33:24.087 --> 33:26.006
Well, for an American.

33:30.093 --> 33:31.345
Yes!

33:31.428 --> 33:32.471
What is it?

33:32.554 --> 33:34.223
-Helios can't land.
-Why not?

33:34.890 --> 33:37.142
Well, the dust storm is getting worse.

33:37.226 --> 33:38.769
If it'll last just a few more days…

33:38.852 --> 33:41.522
Me hearties,
I think we're still in this race.

33:41.605 --> 33:42.606
Yeah!

33:51.448 --> 33:55.369
Then you grind the buds
into a fine powder.

33:57.788 --> 33:59.081
Pretty good, right?

34:02.042 --> 34:03.043
That smells good.

34:04.253 --> 34:06.380
Humboldt County. Premium blend.

34:06.964 --> 34:07.965
Okay.

34:09.132 --> 34:10.425
Make sure you don't lose any.

34:11.009 --> 34:14.179
Now spread it evenly
over the melted butter.

34:19.976 --> 34:22.145
And then simmer for two hours.

34:22.228 --> 34:23.438
Get in there.

34:26.233 --> 34:27.985
Well, thank you, Julia Child.

34:28.068 --> 34:29.444
Bon appétit!

34:30.654 --> 34:32.239
-I'm ready!
-It's a good batch.

34:32.322 --> 34:33.866
Yeah?

34:33.949 --> 34:35.117
Okay.

34:43.041 --> 34:44.960
-Wow!
-Right?

34:45.710 --> 34:47.795
Molly and I call them goo balls.

34:49.422 --> 34:52.592
Brace for impact in about 20 minutes.

35:02.895 --> 35:04.855
It is really peaceful out here.

35:06.148 --> 35:08.066
Yeah. It is.

35:08.150 --> 35:12.112
I haven't really had a chance
to enjoy it until now.

35:14.281 --> 35:15.365
Are you really gonna quit?

35:16.575 --> 35:17.701
I have. It's done.

35:22.789 --> 35:23.790
What?

35:23.874 --> 35:25.292
It's just funny. It's like--

35:26.001 --> 35:28.253
There's this writer, Ken Kesey,

35:28.337 --> 35:32.174
and he said each of us see ourselves
as the star of our own movie.

35:33.175 --> 35:37.137
Okay. Maybe your goo ball is kicking in.
Explain to me what that means.

35:37.221 --> 35:40.766
Well, think about it. A cop sees himself
as the star of a crime thriller.

35:40.849 --> 35:43.936
The criminals, his partner,
they're all supporting players.

35:44.019 --> 35:46.772
An astronaut sees herself in 2001.

35:47.272 --> 35:52.277
So the question is,
what would Karen's movie be?

35:52.361 --> 35:55.322
Don't you dare say The Graduate.

35:55.405 --> 35:59.201
Oh, okay. Well, look,
your sordid past is safe with me.

35:59.284 --> 36:00.911
That one's a little too on the nose.

36:03.622 --> 36:05.040
Okay, what movie?

36:08.502 --> 36:10.629
I don't know. I don't know.

36:10.712 --> 36:13.423
I'd stumbled into it
'cause I wanted to help Ed, so…

36:13.924 --> 36:19.346
All right. So, your movie is Saint Karen,
the altruistic martyr

36:19.888 --> 36:23.642
-who went to save her hapless ex-husband…
-Yes.

36:23.725 --> 36:25.269
-…from abject failure.
-Uh-huh.

36:25.352 --> 36:27.729
-Such a selfless…
-Shut up.

36:27.813 --> 36:31.608
-…magnanimous humanitarian.
-Yes, I get it. I get it.

36:33.485 --> 36:35.195
I did it for me too.

36:37.406 --> 36:38.407
But why?

36:44.371 --> 36:48.876
I remember the day so clearly

36:49.918 --> 36:52.671
that Tracy told me
she was chosen to be an ASCAN.

36:53.255 --> 36:56.341
I was angry with her, with all of them.

36:56.425 --> 36:57.926
I felt like they were judging me.

36:58.886 --> 37:00.846
Because they were doing what you couldn't?

37:00.929 --> 37:03.599
No. God, no. I don't wanna go to space.
I fucking hate space.

37:04.808 --> 37:05.893
Me too.

37:06.602 --> 37:09.104
But they had the nerve to try.

37:10.314 --> 37:12.691
You know? To change their life, and…

37:16.111 --> 37:18.197
Took losing Shane for me to do that.

37:21.867 --> 37:22.868
Right.

37:24.036 --> 37:27.122
I think sometimes
our best moments come from our worst.

37:28.415 --> 37:32.085
Like Molly. She was a mess after NASA.

37:32.920 --> 37:35.005
No idea what to do with herself.

37:35.756 --> 37:38.550
And then, one day,
she picks up one of my paintbrushes

37:38.634 --> 37:40.010
and starts painting.

37:40.886 --> 37:41.887
And she came alive.

37:42.679 --> 37:46.141
-I'm sorry, Molly Cobb's painting?
-Molly-- Yes! She loves it.

37:46.225 --> 37:48.185
And of course,
being Molly, she's good at it too.

37:48.268 --> 37:49.603
How? She can't even see.

37:49.686 --> 37:53.524
No, no. Hey, look, Monet could barely see
by the end of his career.

37:55.526 --> 37:59.196
Well… I am no artist.

37:59.279 --> 38:00.489
All right. Okay.

38:00.572 --> 38:04.368
So, what are you? What does Karen love?

38:07.496 --> 38:11.542
I love taking risks. Love negotiating.

38:12.501 --> 38:16.171
I love building things from the ground up.

38:18.131 --> 38:19.216
And I'm damn good at it.

38:20.384 --> 38:21.385
Yes, you are.

38:25.806 --> 38:28.225
-Wow.
-What?

38:29.977 --> 38:33.355
Do you see the way
the sunlight hits the water?

38:33.438 --> 38:37.818
It's, like, liquid art.

38:40.487 --> 38:41.822
Welcome to the goo.

38:44.700 --> 38:46.618
-Oh, God.
-I told you.

38:48.871 --> 38:52.583
Okay. Okay. I'm gonna--
Okay, I am a little--

38:52.666 --> 38:54.084
I'm stoned.

38:54.668 --> 38:56.753
I'm very stoned.

38:58.630 --> 38:59.715
Oh, my God.

39:00.382 --> 39:04.595
Wayne came over
and he taught me how to make--

39:04.678 --> 39:07.639
He taught me
how to make marijuana desserts.

39:08.682 --> 39:11.268
Goo balls!
He taught me how to make goo balls.

39:11.351 --> 39:13.937
I mean, what's next?

39:18.442 --> 39:20.652
I'm just happy for you.

39:20.736 --> 39:24.698
I'm so happy for you.
I mean, you're going to Mars, Ed.

39:25.490 --> 39:30.204
Mars. Can you hear me?
You are going to Mars, Ed!

39:30.996 --> 39:33.999
Mars. Holy shit!

39:35.334 --> 39:40.214
You're… going to Mars.

39:45.552 --> 39:47.429
I'm so proud of you.

39:58.315 --> 40:00.025
What are you doing?

40:00.108 --> 40:02.486
I may just have to try
one of those desserts.

40:02.569 --> 40:04.112
Just don't tell Kelly, or I'll…

40:04.196 --> 40:06.156
-…never hear the end of it.
-Danny, you up?

40:13.872 --> 40:14.873
My cabin.

40:28.512 --> 40:31.723
I've been thinking a lot about Apollo 10
the past few days,

40:31.807 --> 40:33.141
about me and your dad.

40:37.145 --> 40:38.897
Could've been me and him sittin' here.

40:40.315 --> 40:42.234
Or if things had…

40:45.654 --> 40:46.947
It might've been you and Shane.

40:48.907 --> 40:50.784
He always wanted
to be an astronaut like you.

40:59.960 --> 41:01.086
It still hurts.

41:03.672 --> 41:08.635
Even after all these years, I keep hoping
that with more time it'll get easier, but…

41:11.180 --> 41:12.264
it doesn't.

41:14.183 --> 41:16.101
Sometimes it feels
like it's getting harder.

41:21.732 --> 41:23.192
It must've been tough on Karen too.

41:25.110 --> 41:26.195
Yeah.

41:26.278 --> 41:29.823
I gotta say,
I'm amazed at how far she's come.

41:30.407 --> 41:33.076
I'm not. That woman's a force of nature.

41:33.160 --> 41:34.995
God help anyone
who tries to get in her way.

41:35.078 --> 41:36.079
Oh, yeah.

41:37.206 --> 41:39.625
-I've seen that side of her.
-When?

41:43.462 --> 41:44.588
The--

41:46.590 --> 41:48.675
The-- The--
The summer I worked at the Outpost.

41:50.260 --> 41:52.095
God pity the supplier
who screwed up an order.

41:54.264 --> 41:57.392
Yeah. I've seen that.

42:00.270 --> 42:02.105
You and her seem to be getting along well.

42:02.189 --> 42:04.650
I don't know if it's that
so much as us just realizing,

42:04.733 --> 42:07.027
you know, how close we've always been.

42:07.736 --> 42:10.906
Even in the tough times, you know?
Especially in the tough times.

42:10.989 --> 42:11.990
Yeah.

42:12.741 --> 42:15.786
Yeah, that's why I gotta say,
I was surprised when you…

42:17.579 --> 42:20.123
you know, got divorced.

42:21.667 --> 42:22.793
I mean, that was a shocker.

42:26.755 --> 42:28.757
-Yeah.
-What happened exactly?

42:32.886 --> 42:34.221
There was lot of things.

42:34.304 --> 42:37.641
Did you-- Did you fuck around on her?

42:41.478 --> 42:44.398
No. I'd never do that.

42:47.734 --> 42:48.735
So, what happened?

42:58.287 --> 42:59.329
Oh, my God.

43:02.249 --> 43:03.250
Karen?

43:09.756 --> 43:10.757
Really?

43:13.635 --> 43:14.970
I can't believe it.

43:15.053 --> 43:19.433
It was a onetime thing, you know?
More about us than the other guy.

43:19.516 --> 43:22.728
Yeah, right. That's the standard bullshit.

43:22.811 --> 43:23.812
It's not.

43:24.396 --> 43:27.274
She took a vow before God
to always be faithful, then broke it.

43:27.357 --> 43:31.278
You're a kid. I used to think like that
when I was your age.

43:31.361 --> 43:35.115
Saw everything in black and white,
good or bad, and nothing in-between.

43:35.199 --> 43:36.575
But the older you get,

43:36.658 --> 43:39.578
the more you start to realize
that things aren't always that simple.

43:41.163 --> 43:42.331
Forgiveness…

43:44.583 --> 43:46.418
is a long, hard road, Danny.

43:49.505 --> 43:50.797
But at the end is grace.

43:58.430 --> 43:59.848
She ever tell you who it was?

44:01.099 --> 44:02.309
Doesn't matter.

44:03.936 --> 44:05.020
Yeah, I guess not.

44:11.985 --> 44:13.695
But if you ever found out…

44:16.406 --> 44:17.491
think you could forgive him?

44:24.957 --> 44:27.209
If I ever found out who it was,

44:27.292 --> 44:30.504
there'll be nothing left of him
but a greasy spot on the carpet.

44:58.824 --> 45:02.160
Houston, Sojourner.
We are nearing Mars orbit.

45:02.995 --> 45:06.248
Our telemetry shows
Phoenix is just ahead of us.

45:06.331 --> 45:08.333
We are beginning preparations for landing.

45:08.834 --> 45:12.421
Copy, Sojourner.
Sending you new descent trajectory.

45:37.196 --> 45:40.490
I was right there
when Apollo 11 landed on the moon.

45:41.617 --> 45:43.660
We weren't sure if they were gonna
make it back.

45:44.620 --> 45:50.792
Twenty-five years later and I still have
the same butterflies in my stomach.

45:52.753 --> 45:56.590
Of course. Mars is much more difficult,

45:56.673 --> 45:58.300
much more dangerous than the moon.

45:58.926 --> 46:01.512
Of the first 15 probes we sent,

46:01.595 --> 46:03.889
we lost all but two
during descent and landing.

46:04.473 --> 46:08.101
We lost three out of our first nine.
Entry, descent and landing.

46:09.311 --> 46:13.690
The seven minutes of terror.
That's what we call it.

46:15.150 --> 46:16.276
That's a good name.

46:19.863 --> 46:24.159
For what it's worth,
I have a good feeling this time.

46:29.957 --> 46:31.667
It's good to see you smile again.

46:33.627 --> 46:36.672
Excuse me. Director Madison?

46:40.342 --> 46:42.845
-I thought I told you to let this go.
-I couldn't.

46:42.928 --> 46:44.471
-Listen, we--
-No, Alexei's a quick study,

46:44.555 --> 46:45.889
but he is too quick.

46:45.973 --> 46:48.767
All the procedures he used
on the Russian engines

46:48.851 --> 46:50.561
are the same that we use on ours.

46:51.436 --> 46:53.814
They left their documents aboard Mars-94,

46:53.897 --> 46:57.109
yet he had the "never exceed" parameters
memorized.

46:57.192 --> 47:00.112
He'd have to. You don't have time
to look those up in an emergency.

47:00.195 --> 47:04.283
Right, so--
Please, Margo, just look at this.

47:07.703 --> 47:10.622
Okay, Russian combustion chamber
overtemperature redline

47:10.706 --> 47:12.749
-was 3,350 kelvin.
-"3,350 kelvin."

47:12.833 --> 47:14.209
Chamber overpressure redline

47:14.293 --> 47:16.503
-is 65.5 bar.
-"65.5 bar."

47:17.171 --> 47:19.131
Turbopump overspeeds at 33,000 rpm…

47:19.214 --> 47:23.218
"33,000 rpm." And he goes on,
but the point is,

47:24.469 --> 47:26.722
all of his values matches with our NERVA.

47:29.433 --> 47:32.269
He's gotta be using our numbers
to keep from revealing his own.

47:32.352 --> 47:36.440
Can't be. These don't come from
the engines currently on Sojourner.

47:37.274 --> 47:38.317
These numbers…

47:40.152 --> 47:41.778
are from '92.

47:43.030 --> 47:45.574
These are our current numbers.

48:15.979 --> 48:19.316
Why would Alexei memorize our old numbers?

48:20.150 --> 48:22.069
Where would he get them
in the first place?

48:22.152 --> 48:27.449
From a rivet-by-rivet copy
of our engines from two years ago.

48:31.828 --> 48:33.247
Margo, it's the only way.

48:44.633 --> 48:46.969
Somebody at NASA must've
given them our design.

48:47.052 --> 48:48.136
Right now,

48:49.137 --> 48:54.601
we need to focus on getting
our astronauts safely down on Mars.

48:54.685 --> 48:55.686
But…

48:57.479 --> 48:59.022
once we've done that,

49:00.190 --> 49:03.694
I will take this to the DOJ.

49:03.777 --> 49:06.405
But you need to stop obsessing over this.

49:12.411 --> 49:13.537
Thank you, Margo.

49:15.163 --> 49:16.665
Just leave 'em.

49:49.239 --> 49:51.700
With Phoenix just minutes ahead
of Sojourner

49:51.783 --> 49:55.495
it remains anyone's race to win
as the whole world waits

49:55.579 --> 49:58.957
to see who will land first
on the surface of Mars.

49:59.541 --> 50:03.045
The massive dust storm that has obscured
both ships' landing sites

50:03.128 --> 50:06.381
for the past several days
is being constantly monitored.

50:07.090 --> 50:09.801
As each ship nears
the landing decision point,

50:09.885 --> 50:12.179
what they call their "go/no-go,"

50:12.262 --> 50:15.641
each commander must decide
whether the dust storm has cleared enough

50:15.724 --> 50:17.518
to proceed with a safe landing.

50:17.601 --> 50:20.020
If they make the decision to not land,

50:20.103 --> 50:22.564
the ship will make
another full orbit of Mars

50:22.648 --> 50:26.193
until they come back around
to the very same decision point,

50:26.276 --> 50:29.071
an orbit that would take over two hours.

50:29.154 --> 50:33.033
But at that point, they may have
already lost the race for Mars.

50:33.116 --> 50:35.702
The stakes could not be higher
for both crews,

50:36.286 --> 50:42.042
as years, even decades, of preparation
and planning comes down to this moment.

50:47.130 --> 50:48.841
Come on, people.
This clock is ticking here.

50:48.924 --> 50:49.925
Now, what have we got?

50:51.093 --> 50:52.845
That looks exactly
like the one from yesterday.

50:52.928 --> 50:55.430
Yes, but when you A-B the two…

51:01.436 --> 51:02.646
Dust is thinning.

51:02.729 --> 51:04.523
We should confirm it
on our next satellite pass.

51:04.606 --> 51:06.358
Then we'd be committed to another orbit.

51:06.441 --> 51:08.777
By that time,
Sojourner will already be on the ground.

51:08.861 --> 51:11.238
It would be a very risky landing,
Commander.

51:14.324 --> 51:15.409
What do you say, kiddo?

51:18.245 --> 51:20.163
-Let's go for it.
-Attaboy.

51:21.290 --> 51:22.708
Prep Popeye for launch.

51:27.212 --> 51:31.133
Houston, Sojourner.
We are prepped for our landing sequence.

51:33.927 --> 51:35.262
Okay.

51:35.345 --> 51:38.599
In six minutes, we either enter orbit
or go for the ground.

51:39.391 --> 51:41.185
Round the horn. EECOM?

51:41.268 --> 51:44.021
EECOM is go for direct entry,
descent and landing.

51:44.104 --> 51:45.189
Props?

51:45.272 --> 51:48.192
Pressure in propellant tanks,
reactor values nominal.

51:48.275 --> 51:49.276
Guidance?

51:49.359 --> 51:52.029
Sojourner's configured for entry,
descent and landing.

51:52.112 --> 51:53.614
Ready in all respects, Commander Poole.

51:54.114 --> 51:56.200
Okay, Rolan,
what are we looking at down there?

51:56.283 --> 52:00.204
Sat relay saying 1,070 at 60.

52:00.287 --> 52:02.956
Visibility 80. Ceiling unknown.

52:06.877 --> 52:09.296
Too risky.
Visibility's still below minimums.

52:11.298 --> 52:13.884
We'll try again for landing
when we come back around in two hours.

52:29.107 --> 52:30.442
You ready, Mr. Stevens?

52:31.151 --> 52:32.152
Yes, sir.

52:33.529 --> 52:35.405
Then let's roll.

52:38.784 --> 52:41.662
Phoenix, Popeye is go for Mars descent.

52:41.745 --> 52:45.123
Roger, Popeye. Godspeed.

52:59.972 --> 53:02.099
New radar contact separating from Phoenix.

53:02.766 --> 53:07.020
-It's their lander.
-Jesus. Ed is going for it, even in this.

53:07.104 --> 53:10.190
They feel us breathing down their necks.
If we go down direct, we could beat them.

53:10.274 --> 53:11.900
We only get one shot at this,

53:11.984 --> 53:14.778
and I do not intend
to risk this crew or this mission

53:14.862 --> 53:16.113
on a low-percentage attempt.

53:16.196 --> 53:20.826
Again with the caution.
Helios is going to set down in 13 minutes.

53:20.909 --> 53:23.537
For the honor of our two nations,
we cannot wait.

53:23.620 --> 53:26.999
If Ed can't see, he doesn't have the gas
to hang around and wait.

53:27.082 --> 53:28.792
He's gonna need a miracle
to get through this.

53:28.876 --> 53:31.211
I'm telling you, land now.

53:31.295 --> 53:34.423
Mr. Kuznetsov,
I am the commander of this vessel.

53:34.506 --> 53:38.886
From this moment on,
your unrequested opinions are not welcome.

53:38.969 --> 53:43.515
Rolan, if you hear one more peep
out of that guy, kill his mic.

53:43.599 --> 53:44.892
With pleasure, Commander.

54:06.371 --> 54:07.456
Here we go.

54:07.956 --> 54:10.250
Telemetry from Sojourner
indicates no burn.

54:10.334 --> 54:12.127
Still approaching their go/no-go point.

54:15.464 --> 54:19.009
Commander, we've got 30 seconds
until our landing decision point.

54:19.092 --> 54:20.427
What do you want to do?

54:25.724 --> 54:27.726
Rolan, are you seeing what I'm seeing?

54:29.853 --> 54:33.190
1-0-niner-0 at 40. Visibility 110.

54:33.273 --> 54:34.399
It's clearing up.

54:34.483 --> 54:36.610
Yes. Visibility is improving.

54:36.693 --> 54:39.363
Range to touchdown 16,035.

54:40.364 --> 54:44.326
Go or no-go in eight seconds. Seven, six…

54:44.409 --> 54:46.537
Button up, people.
We're going straight in.

54:49.957 --> 54:51.416
Get ready for a bumpy ride.

54:51.500 --> 54:52.668
Execute!

55:19.403 --> 55:22.114
Sojourner has started their Mars descent.

55:22.197 --> 55:23.824
They are right on your heels.

55:23.907 --> 55:27.411
Altitude 9,000 meters. Range 10.3 klicks.

55:29.788 --> 55:31.665
I've lost the gyroscopes.

55:35.043 --> 55:38.088
Ed, without the gyroscopes
working, it's incredibly dangerous.

55:38.172 --> 55:39.756
You may want to consider aborting.

55:53.353 --> 55:55.814
Descent command engine override off.

55:58.025 --> 55:59.693
Descent command engine override off.

56:06.950 --> 56:10.746
Altitude 4,000 meters. Speed 557.

56:12.706 --> 56:13.874
Continuing descent.

56:19.379 --> 56:22.466
Get ready for a bumpy ride. Execute!

56:22.966 --> 56:24.676
Sojourner has begun direct descent,
Flight.

56:29.431 --> 56:30.807
She's got this.

56:32.518 --> 56:33.644
She's got this.

56:48.534 --> 56:52.162
-Warning. System overload.
-1,800 meters. 2.1 klicks.

56:52.246 --> 56:54.790
-Warning. System overload.
-Speed 290, coming down at 1,809.

56:54.873 --> 56:56.083
Warning. S-

56:57.125 --> 56:58.252
Come on.

56:59.336 --> 57:00.838
Descent engines.

57:02.548 --> 57:05.342
Doors open. Engines armed.

57:06.009 --> 57:07.386
Alexei, you're up.

57:07.469 --> 57:12.140
Decent engines' pre-valves open.
Propellant pressure nominal.

57:12.724 --> 57:13.684
Light 'em up!

57:18.689 --> 57:20.691
1,000 meters. Down to 400.

57:24.319 --> 57:27.447
I've lost altitude info.
The altimeter can't see through the dust.

57:27.531 --> 57:29.658
We're not going to know
how close we are to the ground.

57:29.741 --> 57:31.076
Switching to manual.

57:33.120 --> 57:35.873
Gonna arrest our descent here
and feel our way down.

57:38.125 --> 57:39.293
Come on.

57:45.257 --> 57:46.258
Come on!

58:02.441 --> 58:03.984
Starting the abort sequence.

58:04.067 --> 58:05.694
Are you kidding? Stop.

58:05.777 --> 58:07.905
Phoenix, Popeye aborting to orbit.

58:08.488 --> 58:11.241
No, give me control.
Give me control. I will get us down.

58:11.325 --> 58:12.659
My decision is final!

58:22.419 --> 58:26.673
Altitude radar's losing lock.
We're landing blind. Gear down.

58:30.761 --> 58:32.638
Gear down and locked. Down in ten.

58:36.350 --> 58:37.351
Five.

58:43.065 --> 58:44.149
Still too fast!

58:44.983 --> 58:46.568
Engine one is lagging!

58:48.487 --> 58:49.947
Brace for impact!

59:04.127 --> 59:06.880
Houston, Happy Valley base.

59:06.964 --> 59:10.843
Sojourner has safely landed
eight human beings on Mars.

59:16.431 --> 59:18.350
Yeah!

59:18.433 --> 59:19.685
Yes!

59:22.312 --> 59:23.313
Yes!

59:44.334 --> 59:46.295
-We did this.
-Yes.

59:46.378 --> 59:48.255
-We made this happen today.
-Yes, we did.

59:48.338 --> 59:50.299
We did.

59:50.382 --> 59:52.843
And now we're gonna finish
what we started.

59:52.926 --> 59:55.929
I'm gonna get you and your family
over here, whatever it takes.

1:00:10.485 --> 1:00:11.695
Well done.

1:00:33.926 --> 1:00:38.555
This is a landmark day
in the long saga of the human race.

1:00:39.264 --> 1:00:44.853
The now-combined American
and Soviet crew of Danielle Poole,

1:00:44.937 --> 1:00:48.023
William Tyler, Rolan Baranov,

1:00:48.106 --> 1:00:51.276
Kelly Baldwin, Grigory Kuznetsov,

1:00:51.360 --> 1:00:56.281
Dimitri Mayakovsky, Isabel Castillo
and Alexei Poletov

1:00:56.365 --> 1:01:00.244
are the first human beings
to land on another planet.

1:01:00.327 --> 1:01:01.578
Let's go to the White House

1:01:01.662 --> 1:01:05.123
where President Ellen Wilson
and President Mikhail Gorbachev

1:01:05.207 --> 1:01:08.836
are about to address a crowd
of reporters and well-wishers.

1:01:08.919 --> 1:01:13.465
Today, we did
one of the hardest things imaginable.

1:01:14.550 --> 1:01:18.178
And this time, we came not alone,
but with our former rival,

1:01:18.720 --> 1:01:21.306
working together as true partners.

1:01:31.984 --> 1:01:34.862
Okay. The EVA ramp is fully lowered.

1:01:34.945 --> 1:01:37.739
Good. Now, once we step out,

1:01:37.823 --> 1:01:39.324
let's all take a moment to j--

1:01:41.159 --> 1:01:43.453
Hey, what the hell are you doing?

1:01:43.537 --> 1:01:44.872
Going onto surface.

1:01:44.955 --> 1:01:47.499
No, I'm goin' first. That was the deal.

1:01:49.585 --> 1:01:51.295
I remember no such deal.

1:01:51.879 --> 1:01:54.798
If you don't step your commie ass
back from that hatch,

1:01:54.882 --> 1:01:57.092
I'm gonna come over there
and smack you down!

1:01:57.843 --> 1:01:59.219
Move it. Damn it!

1:01:59.803 --> 1:02:04.183
And there it is,
our first images from the surface of Mars.

1:02:04.683 --> 1:02:08.562
We are waiting to watch
the first human set foot on the Red Planet

1:02:08.645 --> 1:02:12.274
as Aleksei Leonov did on the moon
25 years ago.

1:02:14.484 --> 1:02:15.652
There's some movement.

1:02:15.736 --> 1:02:19.323
It looks like a cosmonaut
and an astronaut.

1:02:19.406 --> 1:02:21.825
Which one will take the--
Wait. They're going together!

1:02:21.909 --> 1:02:23.327
How inspiring.
