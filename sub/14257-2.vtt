01:11.500 --> 01:12.738
Yeah !

01:13.910 --> 01:15.415
Nice Hammerlock.

01:21.442 --> 01:24.018
I can't think of a better way to relax

01:24.019 --> 01:25.257
than by watching wrestling.

01:25.258 --> 01:26.494
You said it.

01:26.495 --> 01:29.139
The terrible turtle
knows all the right moves.

01:29.140 --> 01:30.646
Yeah, he could beat
any other wrestler

01:30.647 --> 01:33.122
with both hands tied
behind his shell.

01:33.123 --> 01:34.863
What shell ?
He hasn't got a shell.

01:34.864 --> 01:36.536
Michelangelo !

01:36.537 --> 01:38.411
We were watching wrestling !

01:38.412 --> 01:41.324
That's like a total snore, dudes.

01:41.325 --> 01:44.637
Now, this is really intense.

01:44.638 --> 01:49.257
It's time for on trial
with Clayton Kellerman.

01:49.258 --> 01:52.704
And now here's the man
you love to hate,

01:52.705 --> 01:54.780
Clayton Kellerman !

01:54.781 --> 01:56.720
Good evening, jerks !

01:56.721 --> 01:58.227
Yeah !
Yeah !

01:58.228 --> 01:59.967
Yeah !

01:59.969 --> 02:01.976
You got to be kidding,
Michelangelo.

02:01.977 --> 02:04.353
This guy makes pond scum
look good.

02:04.354 --> 02:07.667
Yeah. It's a terrible show.

02:07.668 --> 02:09.173
<I>Au contraire, compadres.

02:09.174 --> 02:11.516
It's even more radical
than wrestling.

02:11.517 --> 02:15.332
I'll bet you thought you knew 
about all the nut cases out there

02:15.333 --> 02:17.675
trying to sabotage our way of life.

02:17.676 --> 02:18.780
Now, didn't ya ?

02:18.781 --> 02:20.084
Yeah !

02:20.085 --> 02:21.592
Well, you're wrong.

02:21.593 --> 02:24.337
Let me tell you about a threat
right under your feet,

02:24.338 --> 02:26.277
in the sewers.

02:26.278 --> 02:27.785
Let's talk turtles,

02:27.786 --> 02:30.630
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles !

02:30.631 --> 02:34.244
I got a bad feeling about this.

02:34.245 --> 02:35.750
About what, guys ?

02:35.751 --> 02:37.256
Just listen to this.

02:37.257 --> 02:39.767
And I say these freaky turtles
are menaces

02:39.768 --> 02:42.445
who ought to be hunted down.

02:42.446 --> 02:44.018
Yeah !
Yeah !

02:44.019 --> 02:45.257
Look at them !

02:45.258 --> 02:46.596
Yeah, all they need
are some torches

02:46.597 --> 02:48.303
and a castle to storm.

02:48.304 --> 02:50.310
They're acting like animals.

02:50.311 --> 02:52.319
What am I saying ?

02:52.320 --> 02:55.064
Why is he turning people
against us, April ?

02:55.065 --> 02:58.980
Yeah, we don't exactly
have the best p.r. image as it is.

02:58.981 --> 03:00.923
Don't take it personally, guys.

03:00.924 --> 03:02.428
Kellerman hates everybody.

03:02.429 --> 03:05.508
He's got all the charm
of an electric eel.

03:05.509 --> 03:07.785
Here, these ought to make you
feel better.

03:11.869 --> 03:13.876
Where'd you get these,

03:13.877 --> 03:15.784
At Freddie's Garage sale ?

03:15.785 --> 03:17.558
I had wardrobe make them up.

03:17.559 --> 03:18.530
Try them on.

03:19.903 --> 03:21.776
Hey, great.

03:21.777 --> 03:23.918
Now we don't look like mutant turtles.

03:23.919 --> 03:25.257
Yeah !

03:25.258 --> 03:27.936
We look like mutant
turtles wearing people masks.

03:27.937 --> 03:30.947
I think it makes
a real fashion statement.

03:30.948 --> 03:32.889
And the statement is "yuck."

03:34.128 --> 03:39.048
So the turtles beat you
again, Shredder,

03:39.049 --> 03:42.228
and you call yourself
a supervillain ?

03:42.229 --> 03:45.676
Superklutz is more like it.

03:45.677 --> 03:47.751
Oh, cool down.

03:47.752 --> 03:49.257
Cool down ?

03:49.258 --> 03:51.935
Look at that thermometer.

03:51.936 --> 03:57.458
If we had the solar benite
you were sent to the surface steal,

03:57.459 --> 04:01.977
we could use it to power
the refrigeration units,

04:01.978 --> 04:04.487
but did you get any ?

04:04.488 --> 04:06.328
No !

04:06.329 --> 04:09.006
If you think it's so easy, Krang,

04:09.007 --> 04:11.014
why don't you go up and get it ?

04:11.015 --> 04:13.793
And take care of the turtles
while you're at it.

04:13.794 --> 04:16.805
Not a bad idea for once.

04:16.805 --> 04:19.817
I'll use brains instead of brawn,

04:19.819 --> 04:23.902
but it's not enough to just defeat them.

04:23.903 --> 04:27.416
I must crush them completely !

04:27.417 --> 04:30.195
Hey, these masks are
really cool, April.

04:30.196 --> 04:32.270
You can even eat pizza in them.

04:34.379 --> 04:36.755
I'm glad you like them, guys.

04:38.262 --> 04:39.299
Trouble.

04:39.300 --> 04:40.805
No problem, April.

04:40.806 --> 04:43.316
Trouble is our middle name.

04:43.317 --> 04:46.228
I didn't know we had middle names.

04:49.844 --> 04:51.449
Not bad, huh ?

04:51.450 --> 04:53.525
Oh, outstanding, mon frere,

04:53.526 --> 04:56.036
And check out these chuks !

04:56.037 --> 04:57.374
Yeah !

04:58.615 --> 05:02.128
Looks like another victory
for the forces of good.

05:02.129 --> 05:04.638
Don't you mean the forces of green ?

05:04.639 --> 05:07.082
Get outta town, turtles !

05:07.083 --> 05:09.091
Kellerman's right !
You're no good !

05:09.092 --> 05:11.065
Yeah ! Get away from us humans !

05:11.066 --> 05:13.040
We don't want your kind here !

05:14.380 --> 05:17.290
I'm picking up some
really negative vibes here.

05:19.568 --> 05:21.474
I think they mean business.

05:21.475 --> 05:23.584
Yeah, time to boogie, dudes,

05:23.585 --> 05:25.592
And i'm talking warp speed !

05:25.593 --> 05:27.567
Yeah, but where to ?

05:27.568 --> 05:29.007
Quick, over there !

05:35.870 --> 05:37.308
You, too, April.

05:44.171 --> 05:45.978
It's all that Clayton Kellerman's
fault.

05:45.979 --> 05:48.554
We should do something about him.

05:48.555 --> 05:52.103
April, can you get us
air time on on trial

05:52.104 --> 05:53.776
to present our side ?

05:53.777 --> 05:55.283
Oh, I'm sure I could.

05:55.284 --> 05:56.656
Vern Thompson would ok anything

05:56.657 --> 05:59.065
that will deliver big ratings.

05:59.066 --> 06:02.681
Good. Then maybe
people will understand us.

06:03.752 --> 06:05.458
Hey, Krang, Shredder says

06:05.459 --> 06:08.538
you're going to personally
take on the turtles.

06:08.539 --> 06:11.250
Can we come, too ?
Can we ? Huh ?

06:11.251 --> 06:12.756
Forget it.

06:12.757 --> 06:14.864
I'll handle this myself

06:14.865 --> 06:19.182
as soon as I think of a plan
that's nasty enough.

06:19.183 --> 06:20.689
Gee, too bad.

06:20.690 --> 06:24.203
We had nothing planned
for this afternoon.

06:24.204 --> 06:28.220
Yeah, I guess we'll just have
to watch tv instead.

06:28.221 --> 06:30.631
Oh, boy, it's the smurfs,

06:30.632 --> 06:32.907
my favorite.

06:32.908 --> 06:34.412
Pretty good reception

06:34.413 --> 06:36.924
for being 5 miles underground.

06:36.925 --> 06:39.601
Tonight at 7:30, live...

06:39.602 --> 06:42.613
The infamous Teenage
Mutant Ninja Turtles !

06:42.614 --> 06:44.120
Be there !

06:44.121 --> 06:45.626
The turtles ?

06:45.627 --> 06:48.505
It's too good to be true !

06:48.506 --> 06:51.015
If I time this right,

06:51.016 --> 06:54.028
I'll be able to destroy them

06:54.029 --> 06:55.935
On National Television !

06:55.936 --> 06:59.383
Now all I need is the proper weapon.

06:59.384 --> 07:02.563
Let's see...
Atomic destabilizer ?

07:02.564 --> 07:04.538
Too messy.

07:04.539 --> 07:06.614
Freeze ray ?
Too quick.

07:06.615 --> 07:09.458
I want them to suffer.

07:09.459 --> 07:12.772
You said the turtles
Would be on the show.

07:12.773 --> 07:15.919
Now you're telling me
They're wimping out ?

07:15.920 --> 07:17.593
No, no !
They just don't think

07:17.594 --> 07:20.104
It's wise to expose
Themselves to the public.

07:20.105 --> 07:21.944
We'll do a remote
From the basement.

07:21.945 --> 07:24.288
The basement ?
Oh, yuck !

07:24.289 --> 07:25.826
No matter
Where we shoot it,

07:25.827 --> 07:28.305
The ratings will
Be fantastic !

07:28.306 --> 07:29.810
You're right !

07:29.811 --> 07:31.651
I'm gonna make turtle soup

07:31.652 --> 07:33.760
Out of those
Slimeshells !

07:33.761 --> 07:34.999
I better go.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.008
I've got to help them
Get ready for the show.

07:37.009 --> 07:39.383
I can't wait to see
The turtles again.

07:39.384 --> 07:42.363
Imagine the turtles
As media superstars.

07:42.364 --> 07:44.973
I wonder
If i can get
Their autographs.

07:44.974 --> 07:48.990
I wonder if they'll
Still talk to me.

07:48.991 --> 07:51.669
Don't worry,
Michelangelo.
You'll do just fine.

07:51.670 --> 07:53.174
I don't know.

07:53.175 --> 07:55.551
What if i like
Get stage fright

07:55.552 --> 07:57.459
And get laughed
Off the show ?

07:57.460 --> 08:01.275
A wise man has nothing
To fear from laughter,
Michelangelo.

08:01.276 --> 08:02.781
Oh, yeah,
A wise man,

08:02.782 --> 08:05.793
But what about
A wacky turtle ?

08:05.794 --> 08:08.037
Relax ! Just let me
The talking.

08:08.038 --> 08:10.112
I can handle
This kellerman clown.

08:10.113 --> 08:11.317
Let's go, guys.

08:11.318 --> 08:13.358
The show doesn't
Start until 7:30,

08:13.359 --> 08:15.467
But we should
Get there early.

08:15.468 --> 08:16.906
Good luck, turtles.

08:16.907 --> 08:19.852
I have a feeling
They might need it.

08:21.092 --> 08:22.597
Still here, krang ?

08:22.598 --> 08:26.714
I thought you'd have
The turtles defeated by now.

08:26.715 --> 08:28.221
Soon, shredder,

08:28.222 --> 08:31.401
Now that i've found
The perfect weapon.

08:31.402 --> 08:35.082
This is a prototype for
A new military weapon.

08:35.083 --> 08:37.995
And it's stored
In the same warehouse

08:37.996 --> 08:39.903
As the solar benite.

08:39.904 --> 08:43.952
With this, i'll be able
To destroy the turtles

08:43.953 --> 08:46.095
Once and for all !

08:51.184 --> 08:52.689
Shredder:
It's not fair !

08:52.690 --> 08:55.133
I deserve to have
A part in this !

08:55.134 --> 09:01.460
The turtles
Are my enemies, too !

09:01.461 --> 09:03.467
I'll need you to distract
The turtles

09:03.468 --> 09:08.154
While my trog soldiers and i
Break into the warehouse.

09:08.155 --> 09:09.392
You heard him.

09:09.393 --> 09:11.234
Prepare to return
To the surface.

09:11.235 --> 09:14.347
Oh, man, that's
All we ever do

09:14.348 --> 09:16.121
Is go up
And down,

09:16.122 --> 09:18.130
Up and down.

09:18.131 --> 09:20.505
It sounds like
The perfect assignment

09:20.506 --> 09:22.648
For a couple of yo-yos.

09:22.649 --> 09:25.393
I made a funny.

09:33.359 --> 09:35.334
Oh, no !

09:35.335 --> 09:38.012
You were supposed
To come up

09:38.013 --> 09:39.551
Behind the museum.

09:39.552 --> 09:41.058
Sorry, boss.

09:41.059 --> 09:43.502
Missed it
By that much.

09:46.782 --> 09:48.288
Michelangelo:
Hang on, april.

09:48.289 --> 09:51.301
We're going
To catch a curl !

09:51.302 --> 09:52.874
Cowabunga !

09:54.650 --> 09:57.995
Next time,
Let's just take a cab, ok ?

09:59.000 --> 10:00.003
Yes, master splinter ?

10:00.004 --> 10:01.811
There are reports
Of strange creatures

10:01.812 --> 10:04.254
In the natural
History museum,
Leonardo.

10:04.255 --> 10:05.761
We'll check it out, sensei.

10:05.762 --> 10:08.138
But what about the tv show ?

10:08.139 --> 10:10.480
Sorry. This is
More important.

10:16.908 --> 10:19.585
Quickly,
Before we're seen !

10:23.368 --> 10:27.150
Hey, you suppose
Old tin teeth and
His trogs are in here ?

10:28.155 --> 10:29.728
Does that
Answer your question ?

10:29.729 --> 10:32.071
Blast them !

10:33.913 --> 10:35.352
Why is it that
Our times together

10:35.353 --> 10:37.794
Always wind up like this ?

10:37.795 --> 10:40.706
Hey ! They just trashed
The amphibian exhibit !

10:40.707 --> 10:42.582
That does it.

10:42.583 --> 10:45.460
No more mr. Nice turtle.

10:50.113 --> 10:52.289
Let's get 'em !

10:52.290 --> 10:54.196
Turtle power !

10:56.741 --> 10:58.715
Cowabunga !

11:03.670 --> 11:05.209
Foolish turtles !

11:05.210 --> 11:06.615
Did you really think

11:06.616 --> 11:10.230
You could beat
A ninja master ?

11:11.402 --> 11:13.677
The thought
Had crossed my mind.

11:13.678 --> 11:17.025
Say your prayers,
Lizard face.

11:17.026 --> 11:19.001
That's turtle face
To you.

11:23.620 --> 11:26.298
How's that
For poetic justice ?

11:33.160 --> 11:35.603
Guard: hey, what's
Going on here ?

11:39.051 --> 11:41.560
Let's see.
First things first.

11:41.561 --> 11:46.247
At last--the solar
Benite is mine.

11:57.796 --> 12:00.808
And finally, myself.

12:00.809 --> 12:03.653
And uh-1,
And uh-2, and...

12:05.595 --> 12:08.105
There's nothing
Like the smell

12:08.106 --> 12:10.548
Of a new robot interior.

12:12.122 --> 12:14.397
Now to test
The stun ray.

12:14.398 --> 12:15.971
Hey ! That's
Government property !

12:15.972 --> 12:17.477
What are you doing ?

12:17.478 --> 12:20.156
That's ok.
Take it for
A test spin.

12:22.834 --> 12:25.176
It works like a charm.

12:26.918 --> 12:30.130
Looks like we came
To the right place.

12:30.131 --> 12:32.138
Stop chattering
And grab a weapon.

12:32.139 --> 12:34.147
They're right behind us.

12:34.148 --> 12:38.397
It's turtle
Bashing time.

12:38.398 --> 12:40.005
There they are !

12:41.713 --> 12:43.854
Look out !

12:43.855 --> 12:45.996
Warthog power !

12:45.997 --> 12:48.506
Would you move it !
Come on ! Let's go.

12:48.507 --> 12:50.582
Come back here,
You freaks.

12:50.583 --> 12:53.494
This gives me
An idea.

12:54.700 --> 12:57.310
Hey, where'd
Everybody go ?

13:00.658 --> 13:03.904
Look out.
A monster.

13:03.905 --> 13:05.745
Bebop,
You imbecile.

13:05.746 --> 13:07.185
Never mind.

13:07.186 --> 13:08.523
I'll
Take care them.

13:08.524 --> 13:12.038
Great. Where's john wayne
When we need him ?

13:12.039 --> 13:15.686
Oh, wow !
Major brainstorm.

13:15.687 --> 13:18.665
You have to come out
Sometime, turtles.

13:18.666 --> 13:21.276
En garde, can-head !

13:21.277 --> 13:22.481
You're all mixed up.

13:22.482 --> 13:25.126
I'm the one
Who wears the mask.

13:25.127 --> 13:27.134
Got you now, dude.

13:30.315 --> 13:33.495
Ohh, what a concept--

13:33.496 --> 13:36.339
Medieval
Break-away threads.

13:36.340 --> 13:38.515
Turtle toe-jam,
Coming up.

13:50.634 --> 13:53.478
There,
In the window !

13:53.479 --> 13:55.553
It's the turtles !

13:55.554 --> 13:56.557
The turtles ?
Terrific !

13:56.558 --> 13:59.167
With this
On the news,

13:59.168 --> 14:02.013
Everyone will watch
<I>on trial tonight.

14:02.014 --> 14:04.925
And that means
Huge ratings.

14:04.926 --> 14:07.871
Return to
The technodrome.

14:07.872 --> 14:11.151
I have no further
Need of you.

14:11.152 --> 14:12.657
This is fun !

14:12.658 --> 14:14.265
I think
I'll keep this

14:14.266 --> 14:17.176
After i dispose
Of the turtles.

14:18.483 --> 14:20.524
Let me at 'em.

14:21.964 --> 14:24.473
Looks like
A standoff, shredder.

14:24.474 --> 14:26.716
So it seems,

14:26.717 --> 14:28.624
But not for long.

14:28.625 --> 14:32.340
Let go of me,
You metal-faced maniac.

14:32.341 --> 14:33.745
He's got april.

14:33.746 --> 14:37.093
I've always admired
Your quick grasp
Of a situation.

14:37.094 --> 14:39.435
Surrender, or else.

14:39.436 --> 14:42.114
What now,
Fearless leader ?

14:42.115 --> 14:43.118
There's no choice.

14:43.119 --> 14:45.127
We can't let him
Hurt april.

14:45.128 --> 14:47.537
you win,
Shredder.

14:47.538 --> 14:48.808
We give up.

14:48.809 --> 14:50.314
That's right,
Turtles.

14:50.315 --> 14:51.821
I win,

14:51.822 --> 14:55.169
And you lose.

14:59.219 --> 15:02.131
It's taps
For you, turtles.

15:02.132 --> 15:05.478
Maybe it's time
We looked into a new
Line of work, guys.

15:06.985 --> 15:08.491
Come in, Shredder.

15:08.492 --> 15:10.834
What perfect timing.

15:10.835 --> 15:13.745
I'm just about to
Destroy the turtles.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.018
Oh, no, you don't !

15:15.019 --> 15:18.633
I want that pleasure
To be all mine.

15:18.634 --> 15:20.641
What are you saying ?

15:20.642 --> 15:22.650
I'm saying,
Let them go.

15:22.651 --> 15:24.558
I have the robot now,

15:24.559 --> 15:28.842
And i intend to destroy them
On national television.

15:28.843 --> 15:31.587
I won't ! I won't !
I won't !

15:31.588 --> 15:33.595
You will, you will,
You will !

15:33.596 --> 15:37.712
Or i'll come looking
For you in this thing.

15:37.713 --> 15:40.993
You never
Let me have
Any fun.

15:40.994 --> 15:42.767
Rock steady,
Bebop,

15:42.768 --> 15:44.272
Fall back.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.616
But, boss...

15:46.617 --> 15:47.956
You heard me.

15:47.957 --> 15:48.959
Now !

15:48.960 --> 15:50.164
Don't look now,
Guys,

15:50.165 --> 15:51.972
But i think we just
Got a reprieve.

15:51.973 --> 15:53.745
Let's get 'em !

15:53.746 --> 15:56.256
You may think
You've won, turtles,

15:56.258 --> 15:57.862
But you've lost.

15:58.935 --> 16:00.373
Watch it !
Hey !

16:01.446 --> 16:03.955
Are you guys
All right ?

16:03.956 --> 16:05.194
Oh, fine...

16:05.195 --> 16:06.967
Considering that we just
Got our shells stomped.

16:06.968 --> 16:08.373
I don't get it.

16:08.374 --> 16:09.579
Shredder
Had us cold,

16:09.580 --> 16:10.851
And he let us go.

16:10.852 --> 16:13.394
It's definitely
Bizarro.

16:13.395 --> 16:15.905
He's up to something.
But what ?

16:15.906 --> 16:17.913
Krang told him
To back off.

16:17.914 --> 16:19.587
he's looking for you,
Too.

16:19.588 --> 16:21.529
Krang's up here, too ?

16:21.530 --> 16:23.771
Aw, this has gotta be
I-hate-turtles day ?

16:23.772 --> 16:25.579
We'd better hurry.
We've got less than an hour

16:25.580 --> 16:27.988
Before the on trial show
Starts.

16:27.989 --> 16:31.469
Oh, no !
We forgot all about
Being on tv.

16:31.470 --> 16:34.516
Shredder's gone.
We may as well
Go ahead and do it.

16:34.517 --> 16:36.592
Come on. We'll
Sneak out the back way.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.273
Thanks, guys.
We'll take it from here.

16:40.274 --> 16:42.783
You guys can talk to
Kellerman from down here.

16:42.784 --> 16:44.558
You ok,
Michelangelo ?

16:44.559 --> 16:47.068
You look
Kind of nervous.

16:47.069 --> 16:48.575
W-who me, n-nervous ?

16:48.576 --> 16:51.419
Wh-what a bogus concept.

16:52.928 --> 16:54.833
Come on, Michelangelo.

16:54.834 --> 16:56.675
It's only a tv show.

16:56.676 --> 17:01.428
Yeah. Just forget that
100 million people
Will be watching you.

17:01.429 --> 17:04.507
100 million people ?

17:04.508 --> 17:07.453
Ok. It's showtime.

17:07.454 --> 17:12.173
And now,
Welcome once again
To on trial,

17:12.174 --> 17:14.648
Starring
Clayton kellerman.

17:14.650 --> 17:16.156
Ok, fruitcakes,

17:16.156 --> 17:20.006
Tonight it's
Turtles <I>on trial.

17:20.007 --> 17:23.018
So, turtles, tell me
Why you're too cowardly

17:23.019 --> 17:25.529
To be in the studio
With me.

17:25.530 --> 17:27.637
Go on, donatello.
Tell him.

17:27.638 --> 17:30.650
Well, you see,
It's like this--

17:33.630 --> 17:36.608
Oh, no, i was afraid
This might happen.

17:43.237 --> 17:46.818
Now i'll find
Those turtles.

17:46.819 --> 17:48.825
You say you're trying
To help people,

17:48.826 --> 17:52.173
And yet you just trashed
The natural history museum.

17:52.174 --> 17:53.679
That wasn't us.

17:53.680 --> 17:56.023
It was shredder
And his mutants.

17:56.024 --> 17:59.672
Yeah, sure,
And i'm the tooth fairy.

17:59.673 --> 18:03.454
This will make
Television history.

18:03.455 --> 18:04.960
You don't understand.

18:04.961 --> 18:07.035
We're trying
To save the world

18:07.036 --> 18:10.884
From an invasion
By an alien brain
From dimension x.

18:10.885 --> 18:13.563
Oh, come on. That's
A little hard to swallow.

18:13.564 --> 18:16.240
What is, the invasion
The brain,
Or the dimension x ?

18:16.241 --> 18:17.747
Hey, i'll ask
The questions here,

18:17.748 --> 18:19.989
You abnormal amphibians.

18:19.990 --> 18:22.265
Clayton's making
Mincemeat out of them.

18:22.266 --> 18:24.876
Krang will fail.
I'm sure of it.

18:24.877 --> 18:26.316
And i'm going
To be there

18:26.317 --> 18:28.525
To laugh at him
When he does !

18:28.526 --> 18:30.031
Come on !
Let's go !

18:30.032 --> 18:32.307
And if you're
Such nice guys,

18:32.308 --> 18:34.148
How come
You carry weapons ?

18:34.149 --> 18:36.424
Yeah !
Yeah !

18:36.425 --> 18:37.931
Hey, dude,

18:37.932 --> 18:40.441
Maybe you'd like to try
Defending the earth
For a while !

18:41.446 --> 18:42.952
What was that ?

18:45.797 --> 18:48.241
Turtles, come out and play !

18:49.848 --> 18:51.353
That
Sounds like krang.

18:51.354 --> 18:53.696
He must have been
Taking voice lessons.

18:53.697 --> 18:55.704
Wow, he can
Really project.

18:55.705 --> 18:58.215
Come on, turtles.
We're needed.

18:58.216 --> 19:00.725
We fight
For truth, justice,

19:00.726 --> 19:03.304
And a bigger slice
Of the pizza pie.

19:03.305 --> 19:07.822
Ok, krang.
Put 'em up,
You blob of brains.

19:07.823 --> 19:10.835
Uh, maybe you'd care
To rephrase that, leonardo ?

19:10.836 --> 19:12.609
You were saying ?

19:12.610 --> 19:14.115
I was saying--

19:14.116 --> 19:15.554
Duck !

19:15.555 --> 19:17.027
That's it, turtles.

19:17.028 --> 19:18.031
Struggle !

19:18.032 --> 19:23.019
It will make my victory
All the sweeter.

19:24.526 --> 19:26.031
Don't look now,
Compadres,

19:26.032 --> 19:29.044
But i think we're
A little bit outgunned.

19:29.045 --> 19:30.249
Tell me about it.

19:30.250 --> 19:32.057
Custer
Didn't have it
This bad.

19:38.719 --> 19:41.061
Hey ! Get that thing
Out of here.

19:41.062 --> 19:42.734
You're ruining
My show.

19:42.735 --> 19:46.248
Uppity human, i'll
Teach you some manners.

19:48.761 --> 19:50.299
Gotcha !

19:50.300 --> 19:52.609
Oh, you've come
Out of hiding.

19:52.610 --> 19:55.621
Yeah. Lucky for you.

19:55.622 --> 20:00.543
I've got the solar benite,

20:00.544 --> 20:03.990
And you, my friends,
Are history !

20:03.991 --> 20:05.496
Oh, no !

20:05.497 --> 20:07.505
This isn't
Really happening.

20:09.011 --> 20:10.115
What in--

20:11.690 --> 20:13.094
Now's our chance.

20:17.916 --> 20:21.898
Wow ! Superchuks,
Do your thing.

20:23.271 --> 20:25.144
Nice work, Michelangelo.

20:25.145 --> 20:27.220
Here's
My contribution.

20:37.832 --> 20:42.516
Shredder, you incompetent,
Staggering cretin !

20:42.517 --> 20:47.035
Help ! My ganglion
Is stuck in some chewing gum.

20:47.036 --> 20:48.977
You...

20:52.493 --> 20:53.897
They got away.

20:53.898 --> 20:55.940
Thank goodness you're all right.

20:55.941 --> 20:58.417
Hey, you saved my life, turtles.

20:58.418 --> 20:59.622
Yeah, I guess we don't look

20:59.623 --> 21:02.768
like such bad guys now,
right, amigo ?

21:02.769 --> 21:05.279
Look, just tell people the truth
about us.

21:05.280 --> 21:07.186
That's all we ask.

21:07.187 --> 21:08.693
I'm sorry, fellas.

21:08.694 --> 21:11.137
But i've got a reputation to maintain,

21:11.138 --> 21:14.149
And I didn't get it by being mr. 
nice guy.

21:14.150 --> 21:16.961
You mean you're going to keep on
badmouthing us ?

21:16.962 --> 21:20.107
Hey, pal, that's show biz.

21:20.108 --> 21:21.111
Ciao.

21:21.112 --> 21:24.292
Oh, man.
What a scuzzbucket !

21:24.293 --> 21:26.199
Well, at least you've got the videotape

21:26.200 --> 21:27.873
of us tangling with Shredder.

21:27.874 --> 21:30.383
Right. That'll prove we're not villains.

21:30.384 --> 21:31.890
Sorry, guys,

21:31.891 --> 21:34.836
But my camera was totaled
during the battle.

21:34.837 --> 21:37.849
Our name is still mud in this city.

21:37.850 --> 21:39.354
Total bummer, dudes.

21:39.355 --> 21:43.571
Some days it just doesn't
pay to come out of your shell.
