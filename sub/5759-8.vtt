WEBVTT

00:01.030 --> 00:02.998
PREVIOUSLY ON
PRETI'Y LI'I'I'LE LIARS...
Spencer: ALI?

00:06.140 --> 00:10.008
Mona: I'VE BEEN TRACKING
MY MISSING RV.

00:10.110 --> 00:12.999
TOBY TOOK IT.
HE GAVE IT TO "A,"
BUT SPENCER ALREADY KNEW THAT.

00:13.110 --> 00:15.374
I WANT TO EXPLAIN EVERYTHING,
BUT I JUST CAN'T.

00:15.480 --> 00:17.004
I KNOW YOU'RE TRYING
TO PROTECT TOBY,

00:18.310 --> 00:19.004
BUT I REALLY WISH
YOU'D THINK ABOUT
THE PEOPLE YOU WERE HURTING.

00:20.250 --> 00:21.547
IF WE JUST TELL THEM THE TRUTH--
"A's" THE ONLY CHANCE I HAVE

00:22.590 --> 00:23.113
OF FINDING OUT WHAT
REALLY HAPPENED TO MY MOM.

00:24.420 --> 00:26.115
I THINK "A" GAVE YOU
SOMETHING REAL.
I'VE GOT TO FIND DR. PALMER.

00:26.220 --> 00:28.154
YOU TELL HER TO STAY AWAY
FROM THAT GIRL!

00:28.260 --> 00:30.148
WHAT GIRL?
THAT BLOND GIRL.

00:30.260 --> 00:33.024
THE MRI CONFIRMED
A PARTIAL TEAR OF
THE ROTATOR CUFF.

00:33.130 --> 00:35.189
WHAT ABOUT SWIMMING?
THERE'S A POSSIBILITY
OF SURGERY.

00:35.300 --> 00:38.019
Aria: YOU KISSED ME,
AND I PUSHED YOU OFF
AND THEN YOU LEFI'.

00:38.130 --> 00:40.462
EVERYBODY KNOWS
YOU AND MR. FITZ
WEREN'T JUST SCRABBLE BUDDIES.

00:40.570 --> 00:43.562
YOU CANNOT BE THE GUY THAT
HELPS ME FEEL BE'I'I'ER ANYMORE.
DON'T YOU GET THAT?

00:43.670 --> 00:46.173
I'M OUR BROTHER. I'M SUPPOSED
TO WATCH OUT FOR YOU.

00:46.280 --> 00:47.804
I'M GONNA MAKE IT UP TO YOU.

00:47.910 --> 00:50.140
STOP! THAT'S MY CAR!
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?!

00:50.250 --> 00:53.708
Hanna:
I FOUND IT IN MY MOM'S CLOSET.
I HAVE TO GET RID OF IT.

00:53.820 --> 00:55.048
Man: HOLD IT!

00:55.150 --> 00:57.186
I DIDN'T KILL ANYONE,

00:57.290 --> 00:58.712
AND I DID NOT BRING A GUN
INTO THIS HOUSE!

00:58.820 --> 01:01.550
YOU HAVE THE RIGHT
TO AN ATTORNEY...
SHE DIDN'T DO IT!

01:01.660 --> 01:03.059
TELL HER THAT
YOU DIDN'T DO IT!

01:03.160 --> 01:04.184
I LOVE YOU.

01:15.570 --> 01:17.060
( groans )

01:17.170 --> 01:19.377
I THINK THAT GOES
ON THE TOP SHELF.

01:19.480 --> 01:22.347
REALLY? THAN KS
FOR TELLING ME THAT.

01:22.450 --> 01:23.747
THIS TIME.

01:25.880 --> 01:28.212
HERE. LET ME DO IT.
I'LL DO IT.

01:32.390 --> 01:34.483
HOW'S YOUR SHOULDER?

01:34.590 --> 01:36.751
OBVIOUSLY STILL HURTS.

01:36.860 --> 01:39.249
PHYSICAL THERAPY
ISN'T REALLY HELPING.

01:39.360 --> 01:40.793
NEITHER IS TENSION.

01:40.900 --> 01:44.222
I KNOW. AND I'M SORRY.

01:44.330 --> 01:46.639
TOBY JUST ISN'T READY
TO LET YOU GUYS KNOW
WHAT'S GOING ON YET.

01:46.740 --> 01:49.163
I SWEAR, WE TRIED
TO FOLLOW SHANA,
BUT I JUST--

01:49.270 --> 01:51.238
CAN WE STOP TALKING
ABOUT SHANA FOR A MINUTE?

01:51.340 --> 01:53.171
WE NEED TO CONCENTRATE ON HANNA.

01:54.580 --> 01:55.672
YEAH, YOU'RE RIGHT.

01:56.810 --> 01:59.142
GOOD. YOU TWO
ARE TALKING.

01:59.250 --> 02:02.447
NOW IF WE COULD ONLY
GET HANNA TO EAT.

02:02.550 --> 02:06.259
WE COULD ORDER THOSE
MOZZARELLA STICKS FROM THE BREW.
SHE LOVES THOSE.

02:06.360 --> 02:09.181
THE BREW CAN'T DELIVER
THE ONE THING SHE REALLY WANTS--
HER MOM.

02:11.260 --> 02:13.251
THIS STUFF IS GE'I'I'ING
ROCK-HARD.

02:13.360 --> 02:14.793
NO, DON'T THROW IT OUT.

02:14.900 --> 02:17.289
MAYBE HANNA'S DAD WILL EAT IT
WHEN HE GETS BACK.

02:17.400 --> 02:20.164
OR WE CAN USE IT TO CHISEL
MRS. MARIN OUT OF JAIL.

02:20.270 --> 02:23.262
I DON'T THINK THAT WOULD
GO OVER SO WELL AT
HER ARRAIGNMENT.

02:23.370 --> 02:25.338
WHAT'S GOING ON
WITH THAT, ANYWAY?
HAS HANNA SAID ANYTHING?

02:25.440 --> 02:29.137
ONLY THAT HER DAD WON'T TAKE HER
TO ANY OF THE MEETINGS WITH
THE LEGAL TEAM.

02:29.250 --> 02:31.309
WELL, I'LL SEE
WHAT I CAN FIND OUT.

02:31.410 --> 02:33.844
LOOK, IT'S GE'I'I'ING LATE.
WHY DON'T YOU TWO HEAD HOME,

02:33.950 --> 02:36.145
AND I'LL MAKE SURE
THAT HANNA GETS SOMETHING TO EAT
BEFORE HER DAD GETS BACK.

02:38.520 --> 02:41.409
CAKE FROSTING AND A SPOON.

02:41.520 --> 02:44.159
I'M GOOD TO STAY.
Emily: ME TOO.

02:44.260 --> 02:47.229
THE ONLY WAY WE'RE
GETTING HANNA THROUGH THIS
IS TOGETHER.

02:53.700 --> 02:55.691
SO WHERE IS SHE,
ANYWAY?

02:58.010 --> 03:01.332
JUST PROMISE ME YOU WON'T
DO ANYTHING STUPID, CALEB.

03:01.440 --> 03:03.840
Caleb: I WOULD NEVER
DO ANYTHING STUPID, HANNA.

03:03.950 --> 03:05.770
NEVER? (scoffs)

03:05.880 --> 03:07.848
YOU LET ME INTO YOUR LIFE.

03:07.950 --> 03:10.839
I THINK THAT WAS
THE SMARTEST THING
I'VE EVER DONE.

03:10.950 --> 03:14.317
YOU ARE NOT GOING TO LOSE ME,
HANNA. I PROMISE, OKAY?

03:14.420 --> 03:17.355
AS SOON AS I FIND SOMETHING
TO HELP GET THESE MURDER CHARGES
OFF OF HER BACK,

03:17.460 --> 03:20.190
I'LL BE RIGHT THERE
BESIDE YOU.
Toby: COFFEE?

03:20.300 --> 03:21.324
Hanna: I SHOULD GO.

03:21.430 --> 03:22.727
THE GIRLS ARE DOWNSTAIRS.

03:22.830 --> 03:25.196
OKAY. I LOVE YOU.

03:25.300 --> 03:26.858
I LOVE YOU TOO.

03:30.540 --> 03:32.405
SHE'S A TOUGH GIRL.

03:32.510 --> 03:34.398
WHO YOU TELLIN'?

03:36.280 --> 03:37.542
YOU READY TO DO THIS?

03:40.050 --> 03:41.813
**

03:41.920 --> 03:45.879
* DIDN'T YOU READ IT
IN THE DETAIL? *

03:45.990 --> 03:48.879
* THAT IF YOU'RE IDLE
THEN YOU WILL FAIL *

03:48.990 --> 03:51.879
* NOW YOU WANNA KNOW
AN ANSWER *

03:51.990 --> 03:54.891
* WELL, IF YOU DANCE
THEN YOU'RE A DANCER *

03:59.940 --> 04:02.636
* THE DEVIL
TAKES CARE OF HIS OWN *

04:02.740 --> 04:04.935
LET'S GET STARTED.

04:18.390 --> 04:19.982
* THE DEVIL TAKES CARE
OF HIS OWN *

04:21.420 --> 04:23.957
* GOT A SECRET,
CAN YOU KEEP IT *

04:24.060 --> 04:26.392
* SWEAR THIS ONE
YOU'LL SAVE *

04:26.500 --> 04:28.889
* BETTER LOCK IT
IN YOUR POCKET *

04:29.000 --> 04:31.560
* TAKING THIS ONE
TO THE GRAVE *

04:31.670 --> 04:36.460
* IF I SHOW YOU THEN I'LL KNOW
YOU WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID *

04:36.570 --> 04:39.004
* 'CAUSE TWO CAN
KEEP A SECRET *

04:39.110 --> 04:41.499
* IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD *

04:46.350 --> 04:50.309
OKAY, SO THE INTAKE SESSION
IS NO COVERED BY INSURANCE?

04:52.120 --> 04:54.680
NO, NO, THAT'S ALL RIGHT.
WE'LL TAKE THE APPOINTMENT.

04:54.790 --> 04:56.678
ALL RIGHT, THANKS.

04:56.790 --> 04:58.951
YOU'RE NOT WORKING
TODAY, ARE YOU?
NO.

04:59.060 --> 05:00.857
WHY? WHAT'S UP?

05:02.500 --> 05:03.068
SOMEONE AT THE STATION SUGGESTED
PROLOTHERAPY FOR YOUR SHOULDER.
( cell phone beeps )

05:04.870 --> 05:06.633
UH, PROLOTHERAPY?

05:06.740 --> 05:09.402
YEAH, IT'S THIS SERIES
OF INJECT IONS

05:09.510 --> 05:10.932
THAT STIMULATE THE TISSUE
AROUND THE INJURY

05:11.040 --> 05:12.337
TO PROMOTE HEALING.

05:12.440 --> 05:13.429
HOW MANY INJECT IONS?

05:14.380 --> 05:17.304
WELL, IT'S ONE A WEEK
FOR ABOUT TWO MONTHS.

05:18.750 --> 05:21.810
MOM, I CAN HELP PAY
FOR PART OF IT
IF THAT HELPS.

05:21.920 --> 05:24.889
NO. NO, NO. THE FIRST SESSION'S
GONNA BE A LITTLE TRICKY,

05:24.990 --> 05:28.482
BUT INSURANCE SHOULD COVER
MOST OF THE TREATMENT.
( cell phone beeps )

05:28.590 --> 05:30.353
AND IF IT WORKS
THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO,

05:30.460 --> 05:32.690
THEN MAYBE YOU WON'T EVEN
HAVE TO HAVE SURGERY.

05:32.800 --> 05:35.394
UM, WELL, THE PHYSICAL
THERAPY HAS BEEN HELPING,

05:35.500 --> 05:37.525
SO IF WE DON'T HAVE TO
SPEND MORE MONEY, THEN...

05:37.630 --> 05:40.497
HONEY, LOOK. YOUR FATHER AND I
BOTH AGREE THAT THIS IS
SOMETHING WORTH TRYING,

05:40.600 --> 05:44.366
SO WE WILL FIND A WAY
TO COVER THE COST, NOT YOU.

05:44.470 --> 05:45.368
( beeps )

05:45.470 --> 05:47.335
I'M SORRY, IT'S HANNA.

05:47.440 --> 05:48.475
SHE'S TRYING TO GET
IN TOUCH WITH ME.

05:49.510 --> 05:51.501
I'M SUPPOSED TO GO OVER THERE
THIS AFTERNOON.

05:51.610 --> 05:54.408
LOOK, EMILY, I KNOW
YOU WANT TO BE THERE FOR HER.

05:54.520 --> 05:57.648
I FEEL SO BAD FOR HANNA.

05:57.750 --> 06:00.514
BUT...RIGHT OR WRONG,

06:00.620 --> 06:04.681
ASHLEY'S BEEN ACCUSED
OF MURDER..

06:04.790 --> 06:08.021
AND I REALLY THINK THAT HANNA
NEEDS TO SPEND SOME TIME
WITH HER FATHER RIGHT NOW.

06:11.800 --> 06:15.531
OKAY, JUST MEET ME
AT THE STATION
AND WE'LL GO FROM THERE.

06:15.640 --> 06:18.700
AND STRAIGHT AFTER SCHOOL--
THE CLINIC WANTS YOU THERE
AT 3:45. OKAY?

06:27.920 --> 06:30.411
Aria: AT LEAST HE FIXED
THE WINDSHIELD.

06:30.520 --> 06:33.489
I WONDER HOW LONG
IT'S GONNA TAKE HIM
TO FIX THE REST.

06:33.590 --> 06:36.457
HE SHOULDA JUST
SOLD THE THING FOR SCRAP
AND STARTED OVER.

06:36.560 --> 06:38.425
MIKE, CONNOR WORKS
AT A COFFEE SHOP.

06:38.530 --> 06:41.055
THE ONLY FOUR WHEELS
HE CAN AFFORD IS A SKATEBOARD.

06:41.160 --> 06:43.799
WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
NOW YOU FEEL SORRY
FOR THIS GUY?

06:43.900 --> 06:47.392
SORRY? NO. NO.

06:47.500 --> 06:50.060
PART OF ME WOULD HAVE
GLADLY TAKEN A WHACK
AT THAT PIATA.

06:50.170 --> 06:53.105
WHOEVER DID IT
KNOWS CONNOR'S A WUSS.

06:53.210 --> 06:55.428
THAT HE ALWAYS GETS
WORKED BY OFFENSE,

06:55.540 --> 06:56.871
HASN'T FOULED OUT OF
A GAME THIS SEASON.

06:56.980 --> 07:00.040
THINGS GET AGGRESSIVE,
HE BACKS DOWN, EVERY TIME.

07:00.150 --> 07:03.711
YOU KNOW, YOU NEVER
SHOWED UP AT EMILY'S
OPEN MIC.

07:03.820 --> 07:07.608
SAD CHICKS IN HIPSTER GLASSES
PLAYING THE SAME THREE CHORDS

07:07.720 --> 07:09.585
AND WHINING
ABOUT THEIR EX?

07:09.690 --> 07:10.725
YEAH, NO THANKS.

07:10.830 --> 07:14.550
SO...

07:14.660 --> 07:16.150
YOU JUST STAYED HOME?

07:16.260 --> 07:17.818
REALLY?

07:17.930 --> 07:20.592
I'M NOT ACCUSING,
I'M JUST INQUIRING.

07:20.700 --> 07:22.600
HELLO? I PLAY LACROSSE.

07:22.710 --> 07:24.200
IT'S A TINY LITTLE STICK.

07:24.310 --> 07:27.131
THAT CAR WAS SMASHED
BY A BAT, A LEAD PIPE,

07:27.240 --> 07:29.640
MAYBE EVEN A SLEDGE HAMMER.

07:29.750 --> 07:31.172
OKAY, FORGET I ASKED.

07:31.280 --> 07:34.113
( school bell rings )

07:34.220 --> 07:35.869
I GOTTA GET TO CLASS.

07:44.060 --> 07:47.029
SO YOUR FATHER DECIDED
TO STAY AT THE HOUSE WITH YOU?

07:47.130 --> 07:50.520
YEAH. IT'LL JUST BE EASIER
THAT WAY.

07:50.630 --> 07:52.222
HE DOESN'T HAVE TO DRIVE ME
ALL THE WAY TO SCHOOL,

07:52.330 --> 07:54.798
AND WE'LL JUST STAY
AT HIS PLACE ON THE WEEKENDS.

07:54.900 --> 07:56.868
ISABELLE AND KATE CALLED.

07:56.970 --> 07:59.575
THEY SAID NICE THINGS,
SO IT SHOULDN'T BE TOO BAD.

07:59.680 --> 08:02.501
SOUNDS LIKE
IT'S ALL WORKING OUT.

08:05.750 --> 08:09.538
UM, MRS. HASTINGS SAID
I SHOULD PICK SOMETHING
FOR YOU TO WEAR TO COURT.

08:09.650 --> 08:13.188
I WAS THINKING
THE NAW SUIT WITH
THE MANDARIN COLLAR?

08:13.290 --> 08:14.655
YEAH, AND THERE'S A--

08:15.790 --> 08:18.725
A WATCH THAT
YOUR GRANDMA MARIN GAVE ME
A LONG TIME AGO.

08:18.830 --> 08:22.561
BE SURE TO GRAB THAT.
THAT'S IN THE TOP TRAY
IN MY JEWELRY BOX.

08:22.670 --> 08:25.264
MRS. HASTINGS SAID
NO JEWELRY.

08:27.570 --> 08:29.037
RIGHT.

08:31.140 --> 08:33.734
(sighs) REGINA IS SUCH
A TOUGH OLD BROAD.

08:33.840 --> 08:36.570
I WAS HOPING
SOME OF THAT WOULD RUB OFF.

08:36.680 --> 08:39.148
(voice breaking)
I COULD REALLY USE
SOME "TOUGH" RIGHT NOW.

08:43.090 --> 08:47.584
UM...SO THE SILENT AUCTION
FOR THE SCHOOL LIBRARY
RENOVATION'S COMING UP.

08:47.690 --> 08:51.626
YEAH.
IT'S GONNA BE IN THIS SWANK
NEW RESTAURANT IN THE CITY.

08:51.730 --> 08:54.927
I DON'T KNOW, I WAS THINKING
THAT MAYBE I SHOULD GET US
TICKET BEFORE IT SELLS OUT.

08:55.030 --> 08:58.568
DON'T, SWEETIE.
I HEARD IT MIGHT
BE BLACK-TIE THIS YEAR.

09:00.770 --> 09:02.738
I-I JUST NEED TO
GET THROUGH THE ARRAIGNMENT.

09:02.840 --> 09:05.638
THAT'S ALL I CAN THINK ABOUT
RIGHT NOW.

09:05.740 --> 09:08.777
WELL, WE CAN BID LIKE CRAZY
ON A SPA PACKAGE

09:08.880 --> 09:11.303
OR A SKI TRIP.
HANNA.

09:11.410 --> 09:13.674
PROMISE ME YOU'LL BE MY DATE.

09:17.020 --> 09:18.681
( deputy knocks on glass )

09:24.090 --> 09:26.695
I CAN'T PROMISE YOU THAT.

09:26.800 --> 09:27.653
YES, YOU CAN.

09:29.830 --> 09:31.798
BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING WITH ME.

09:43.710 --> 09:46.747
YOU SURE THAT SPENCER
REMEMBERED THAT PARTIAL
TAIL NUMBER RIGHT?

09:46.850 --> 09:48.670
I FEEL LIKE I'VE BEEN
AT THIS FOR DAYS.

09:48.780 --> 09:52.284
SHE CAN QUOTE ENTIRE PASSAGES
OF DOSTOYEVSKY--

09:52.390 --> 09:54.278
IN TWO LANGUAGES.
KEEP TRYING.

09:55.320 --> 09:57.982
YOU REALLY THINK THAT
TRACKING DOWN THIS PLANE
IS OUR BEST SHOT?

09:58.090 --> 10:01.150
WHEN I WAS WORKING WITH MONA,
SHE THOUGHT RED COAT
WAS PULLING THE STRINGS.

10:01.260 --> 10:04.696
GETTING THE GIRLS
TO THE LODGE THAT NIGHT
TO BURN THE PLACE DOWN?

10:04.800 --> 10:06.358
THAT'S DEFINITELY
AN "A" MOVE.

10:06.470 --> 10:08.859
HANNA THINKS THAT
ALISON IS STILL ALIVE.

10:08.970 --> 10:10.858
YEAH, SPENCER SAW HER TOO.

10:10.970 --> 10:13.131
EVERYONE ELSE JUST SAW
A BLOND IN A RED COAT.

10:13.240 --> 10:15.731
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
OUT COLD.

10:15.840 --> 10:19.276
FOR ALL I KNOW,
SHE'S THE ONE WHO CLOCKED ME.

10:19.380 --> 10:22.747
YOU KNOW, WHAT I DON'T GET IS
HOW DID RED COAT

10:22.850 --> 10:26.342
GET FROM THORNHILL
ALL THE WAY BACK TO TOWN
TO FRAME HANNA'S MOM?

10:26.450 --> 10:28.759
WHEN WE FIND HER,
WE'LL ASK.

10:28.860 --> 10:30.725
SWITCH?
AH. GLADLY.

10:32.830 --> 10:35.355
OH, HEY. I WAS LOOKING
FOR A PEN EARLIER,

10:35.460 --> 10:36.722
AND I FOUND THIS.

10:40.100 --> 10:41.738
DID YOU READ THAT?
NO. I JUST...

10:41.840 --> 10:44.764
I THOUGHT--
RED COAT IS "A," RIGHT?

10:44.870 --> 10:47.009
WE'RE LOOKING FOR A BLOND.
IT'S NOT THIS.

10:47.110 --> 10:50.876
WHAT WE'RE AFTER,
IT'S, UH, SOMETHING ELSE.

10:50.980 --> 10:52.174
O-KAY.

10:54.780 --> 10:58.238
I'M STARVING.
DO YOU, UM, WANT
ANYTHING FROM DOWNSTAIRS?

10:58.350 --> 11:00.750
I'LL TAKE A SANDWICH
OR SOMETHING.

11:00.860 --> 11:02.782
OKAY.

11:02.890 --> 11:04.926
( computer beeps )
WAIT.

11:05.030 --> 11:06.918
WE GOT A HIT.

11:07.030 --> 11:09.123
SAME KIND OF PLANE
AS THE ONE AT THORNHILL.

11:09.230 --> 11:11.061
THE FLIGHT PLANS
ARE PRIVATE.

11:11.170 --> 11:14.139
THE ADDRESS OF RECORD IS AT
HOWELL ACRES FLIGHT CENTER.

11:14.240 --> 11:15.867
THAT'S NOT FAR FROM HERE.

11:15.970 --> 11:17.005
I'LL DRIVE.

11:20.940 --> 11:24.944
NO ONE'S SEEN SHANA
SINCE THE OPEN MIC.
IT'S LIKE SHE DISAPPEARED.

11:25.050 --> 11:27.814
SHE CAN'T JUST DISAPPEAR.
THIS ISN'T HOGWORTS.

11:27.920 --> 11:29.945
THERE'S ONLY SO MANY HALLS
AND CLASSROOMS.

11:30.050 --> 11:31.813
WELL, SHE SPED OUT OF RAVENSWOOD
IN JENNA'S MUSTANG.

11:31.920 --> 11:34.809
MAYBE SHE KNOWS THAT
SPENCER AND TOBY SAW HER.

11:34.920 --> 11:37.923
MAYBE SHE DOESN'T WANT TO
ANSWER ANY QUESTIONS.
SHE'LL POP UP AGAIN.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.294
LIKE IT OR NOT,
SHE ALWAYS DOES.

11:40.400 --> 11:41.958
I COULD HAVE
BROUGHT THAT TO YOU.

11:42.060 --> 11:44.961
OH. I WAS OUT EARLIER
ANYWAY.

11:45.070 --> 11:46.367
I WENT TO GO
VISIT MY MOM.

11:46.470 --> 11:47.767
HOW IS SHE?

11:55.240 --> 11:56.468
CAN I HELP YOU?

11:57.980 --> 12:00.312
Ezra: EMILY. I CAN
TAKE IT FROM HERE.

12:03.220 --> 12:05.984
SO I'LL SEE YOU LATER?
YEAH, AS SOON AS I CAN.

12:08.990 --> 12:10.855
I'M SURPRISED
YOU SHOWED UP TODAY.

12:10.960 --> 12:14.999
UM, THIS IS ABOUT THE ESSAY
I DIDN'T TURN IN YESTERDAY,
RIN'C'J'T?

12:15.100 --> 12:17.193
THIS IS ABOUT
ME CHECKING IN.

12:17.300 --> 12:19.325
WITH ALL YOU'RE GOING THROUGH,
I CAN'T IMAGINE

12:19.430 --> 12:21.967
LEAVING THE HOUSE,
LET ALONE COMING HERE.

12:22.070 --> 12:23.867
HOW ARE YOU DOING?

12:23.970 --> 12:25.938
WELL, IT'S NOT THAT EASY.

12:26.040 --> 12:28.508
EVERYWHERE I GO
PEOPLE ARE STARING AT ME
ALL JUDGEY-EYED,

12:28.610 --> 12:30.999
LIKE THAT LADY IN THE BOOK.

12:31.110 --> 12:33.112
UH...?
YOU KNOW THE ONE.

12:33.220 --> 12:36.348
WELL, THERE ARE A LOT
OF BOOKS IN THE WORLD, HANNA.
LIKE, REALLY A LOT.

12:36.450 --> 12:38.338
NO, THE-THE ONE
WITH THE JUDGEY EYES

12:38.450 --> 12:40.884
AND--AND THE KNITTING, UM...

12:40.990 --> 12:42.821
MADAME DeBARGE.

12:42.930 --> 12:44.989
DEFARGE?

12:45.090 --> 12:47.229
CLOSE ENOUGH.

12:47.330 --> 12:50.891
UM, CAN I JUST GET AN I.O.U.
FOR THAT ESSAY?

12:51.000 --> 12:52.888
WHAT ESSAY?

12:53.000 --> 12:54.888
THANK YOU, MR. FITZ.

12:55.000 --> 12:57.434
NOT FOREVER, THOUGH,
JUST UNTIL...

12:57.540 --> 12:59.872
YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE LESS
ON YOUR PLATE.

12:59.980 --> 13:03.939
I MEANT THANK YOU FOR BEING
A REALLY DECENT GUY.

13:12.220 --> 13:14.051
MISS MONTGOMERY.

13:14.160 --> 13:16.185
I WAS JUST COMING
TO FIND YOU.

13:16.290 --> 13:18.929
WE HAVE AN ISSUE.
WE DO?

13:19.030 --> 13:20.327
YOUR BROTHER MIKE.

13:20.430 --> 13:22.421
I JUST GOT A CALL
FROM THE POLICE DEPARTMENT.

13:22.530 --> 13:24.919
A STUDENT'S CAR
WAS VANDALIZED,

13:25.030 --> 13:26.793
AND IT'S POSSIBLE
YOUR BROTHER WAS INVOLVED.

13:26.900 --> 13:29.789
DO YOU KNOW
ANYTHING ABOUT THAT?

13:29.910 --> 13:31.798
NO. I MEAN, I--

13:31.910 --> 13:34.936
I WAS AT THE BREW
WHEN IT HAPPENED,
BUT I-I DIDN'T SEE ANYTHING.

13:35.040 --> 13:37.941
AND YOUR BROTHER WAS--
I INVITED HIM
TO COME TO THE SHOW.

13:38.050 --> 13:41.076
BUT HE--HE SAID
THAT HE WANTED TO
VIDEO-CHAT WITH MY MOM,

13:41.180 --> 13:43.080
SO HE STAYED HOME.

13:43.190 --> 13:45.943
AND CONNOR'S CAR
WAS AT THE BREW
WHEN IT HAPPENED, SO--

13:49.990 --> 13:52.959
IS THAT ALL?
NOT QUITE.

13:53.060 --> 13:55.096
HIS MEDICATION--
IS YOUR BROTHER
STILL TAKING IT?

13:55.200 --> 13:58.260
YES, OF COURSE.
WHAT DOES THAT HAVE TO DO--

13:58.370 --> 14:00.338
THERE WERE SOME PROBLEMS
LAST YEAR, ARIA.

14:00.640 --> 14:04.098
I KNOW THAT YOU'RE AWARE
OF THE WAYS IN WHICH
YOUR BROTHER ACTED OUT.

14:04.210 --> 14:06.098
A FIST FIGHT, SOME THEFT--

14:06.210 --> 14:08.269
I'M JUST TRYING TO GET A LOOK
AT THE OVERALL PICTURE HERE.

14:08.380 --> 14:11.076
MR. HACKETT,
MIKE'S FINE.

14:31.070 --> 14:33.994
I'M A LITTLE BUSIER THAN
I THOUGHT I WOULD BE TODAY.

14:35.370 --> 14:37.634
ARE YOU SURE YOU'RE OKAY
DOING THIS BY YOURSELF?
YEAH. I GUESS SO.

14:37.740 --> 14:39.367
IS LIEUTENANT TANNER
IN TODAY?

14:39.470 --> 14:42.007
I SAW HER IN PASSING
THIS MORNING.

14:42.110 --> 14:43.145
HERE YOU GO.

14:43.250 --> 14:45.502
BUT YOU DIDN'QBTALK TO HER?

14:45.610 --> 14:48.010
WHY?
UH, SHE CAME BY
THE OPEN MIC.

14:48.120 --> 14:51.009
I WANTED TO ASK HER
IF SHE LIKED IT.

14:51.120 --> 14:54.180
OKAY, SO I'VE ALREADY FAXED OVER
THE INTAKE PAPERWORK.

14:54.290 --> 14:57.453
JUST SHOW THEM
THE INSURANCE CARD WHEN YOU
CHECK IN WITH THE RECEPTIONIST.

14:57.560 --> 15:00.028
I'VE GOT A KEY
TO SIGN IN.
OH.

15:00.130 --> 15:01.654
HANG ON
ONE SECOND.

15:03.030 --> 15:04.668
WHAT'S THE CASE NUMBER?

15:04.770 --> 15:07.193
W-4-6-8-O-9.

15:10.710 --> 15:13.201
..4-6...

15:16.040 --> 15:17.041
HERE.

15:20.450 --> 15:21.917
OKAY, THAN KS.

15:25.090 --> 15:28.480
ARE THE POLICE STILL LOOKING
FOR OTHER SUSPECT S
IN WILDEN'S MURDER?

15:28.590 --> 15:31.923
YES, EMILY. THE INVESTIGATION
IS STILL ONGOING.

15:32.030 --> 15:35.022
MOM, CAN YOU PRINT OUT
THE DIRECTIONS
TO THE CLINIC?

15:35.130 --> 15:37.064
I'M NOT QUITE SURE
HOW TO GET THERE.

15:37.170 --> 15:38.194
YEAH.

15:41.740 --> 15:44.459
I MEANT TO DO THAT EARLIER.
I'M--I'M SORRY.

15:46.610 --> 15:48.601
OKAY. I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

16:05.290 --> 16:07.622
YEAH. NO, I UNDERSTAND.

16:07.730 --> 16:10.221
OKAY, WELL, WE WILL--
WE'LL SEE YOU THEN.

16:12.130 --> 16:15.964
IS YOUR BROTHER WITH YOU?
I THINK HE HAS PRACTICE.

16:16.070 --> 16:19.233
WELL, I HOPE FOR HIS SAKE
THIS IS ALL JUST A HUGE
MISUNDERSTANDING.

16:19.340 --> 16:22.229
I WAS...

16:22.340 --> 16:24.240
I JUST GOT OFF THE PHONE
WITH THE SCHOOL,

16:24.350 --> 16:27.274
AND ONE OF HIS TEAMMATES
IS FILING A POLICE REPORT,

16:27.380 --> 16:30.247
AND THAT KID'S FATHER
IS PRESSING TO
HAVE HIM EXPELLED.

16:30.350 --> 16:32.181
EXPELLED?
YES.

16:32.290 --> 16:34.258
OVER SOME KIND OF DAMAGE
TO A CAR?

16:34.360 --> 16:36.112
IT'S THAT KID. CONNOR.

16:36.220 --> 16:38.154
THE ONE THAT YOU
TUTORED LAST WEEK.

16:38.260 --> 16:41.252
DID YOU NOTICE
ANY TENSION BETWEEN THEM?

16:41.360 --> 16:43.419
I MEAN, IS IT--
IS THERE ANY TRUTH TO THIS?

16:47.170 --> 16:51.163
ARIA...IF YOU KNOW
SOMETHING ABOUT THIS,
I NEED YOU TO TELL ME.

16:51.270 --> 16:54.273
I THINK THIS IS HAPPENING
BECAUSE OF ME.

16:54.380 --> 16:57.406
CONNOR KISSED ME,
AND I SAID THAT
I WASN'T INTERESTED,

16:57.510 --> 17:00.343
SO HE...STARTED
THIS RUMOR AT SCHOOL.

17:00.450 --> 17:02.270
WHAT KIND OF RUMOR?

17:02.380 --> 17:06.009
THE KIND THAT'S REALLY
NOT WORTH REPEATING.

17:06.120 --> 17:08.156
WHY DIDN'T YOU
COME TO ME WITH THIS?

17:08.260 --> 17:09.682
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
I'D HANDLED IT.

17:09.790 --> 17:11.189
I SET CONNOR AND HIS FRIENDS
STRAIGHT. I--

17:11.290 --> 17:14.293
WHY WOULD HE SAY THESE THINGS
ABOUT YOU?

17:19.200 --> 17:23.307
LOOK, APPARENTLY
THERE'S BEEN SOME TALK...

17:23.410 --> 17:26.561
ABOUT ME AND EZRA.

17:26.670 --> 17:30.504
WELL, I-I GUESS THAT CONNOR
FIGURED THAT SINCE I'D...
DATED AN OLDER GUY

17:30.610 --> 17:34.046
THAT I WOULD DO JUST ABOUT
ANYTHING WITH ANYBODY.

17:35.580 --> 17:37.218
DAD, I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE GONNA SAY--

17:37.320 --> 17:40.039
NO, I'M NOT CONCERNED
WITH EZRA FITZ.

17:40.160 --> 17:42.583
I AM CONCERNED
WITH YOUR BROTHER
AND MAKING SURE

17:42.690 --> 17:44.180
THAT HE HASN'T
GOTTEN HIMSELF INTO TROUBLE.

17:44.290 --> 17:47.054
AND FROM THE SOUND OF IT,
THIS CONNOR KID IS THE ONE

17:47.160 --> 17:49.594
WHO NEEDS TO BE SCRUTINIZED
AND PUNISHED.

17:50.770 --> 17:52.465
WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

17:52.570 --> 17:56.199
I NEED TO SPEAK
WITH YOUR BROTHER ABOUT THIS.

18:14.390 --> 18:15.357
HEY.

18:21.630 --> 18:26.090
OKAY. YOU ARE SEVERAL STEPS
BEYOND GETTING YOURSELF
OUT OF GYM.

18:26.200 --> 18:29.237
HOW DO YOU THINK I'VE BEEN
STAYING HOME ALL WEEK?

18:29.340 --> 18:32.400
I JUST DON'T WANT MY MOM
TO COME HOME TO NO LIGHTS,
NO HOT WATER,

18:32.510 --> 18:34.307
AND A WEEDY LAWN.

18:39.310 --> 18:42.438
HANNA, UM,
I NEED YOU TO HEAR ME.

18:44.420 --> 18:48.311
OKAY, QUIT MAKING THAT FACE.
THAT'S YOUR "BAD NEWS" FACE.

18:54.800 --> 18:57.325
MY MOM'S NOT COMING HOME
ANYTIME SOON, IS SHE?

18:59.330 --> 19:03.334
I OVERHEARD MY MOM
TALKING STRATEGY
WITH MY DAD.

19:06.210 --> 19:07.734
AND?

19:07.840 --> 19:10.274
AND FROM WHAT
IT SOUNDS LIKE,

19:10.380 --> 19:13.440
IT'D PROBABLY BE BETTER
IF SHE HAD DONE IT.

19:15.680 --> 19:18.615
YOUR MOM AND WILDEN HAD
A REALLY TENSE HISTORY.

19:18.720 --> 19:20.585
PROVE THAT HE THREATENED HER,

19:20.690 --> 19:24.353
AND THEY COULD GO FOR
VOLUNTARY MANSLAUGHTER...

19:24.460 --> 19:26.280
WHICH IS TWENTY YEARS.

19:27.400 --> 19:30.460
AND IF NOT...

19:32.670 --> 19:36.458
...THEN IT'S FIRST-DEGREE
MURDER.

19:36.570 --> 19:39.562
AND MY MOM SPENDS
THE REST OF HER LIFE IN JAIL.

19:43.510 --> 19:46.445
OR WORSE.
MAYBE.

19:46.550 --> 19:48.347
THAT'S JUST HOW BAD
IT LOOKS.

19:49.850 --> 19:53.354
NO. THAT'S HOW BAD
"A" MADE IT LOOK.

19:55.720 --> 19:57.881
( both sniffling )

20:09.040 --> 20:12.237
P.A.:
RUNWAY 31 LEFT
CLEARED FOR TAKEOFF.

20:12.340 --> 20:14.433
( announcements continue,
indistinct )

20:20.780 --> 20:23.544
HOW CAN I HELP YOU GUYS?
Caleb: UH, YEAH,

20:23.650 --> 20:26.539
MY BUDDY HERE,
HE GOT STIFFED
ON A KITCHEN REMODEL,

20:26.650 --> 20:29.983
AND THE GUY OWNS A PLANE,
WE THINK HE KEEPS IT HERE.

20:30.090 --> 20:32.479
MAYBE YOU COULD HELP US SEE
IF HE SKIPPED TOWN?

20:32.590 --> 20:34.922
ANYBODY CAN LOOK UP
A FLIGHT PLAN ONLINE.
DO YOU HAVE THE TAIL NUMBER?

20:35.030 --> 20:36.850
WE TRIED THAT
AND NOTHING CAME UP.

20:36.960 --> 20:39.861
HMM. MUST BE ENROLLED IN
THE BLOCKED AIRCRAFT REGISTRY.

20:39.970 --> 20:42.234
HAPPENS SOMETIMES--
CELEBRITIES, CORPORATIONS.

20:42.340 --> 20:44.433
PRIVATE PLAN ES?
SOM ETIM ES.

20:44.540 --> 20:46.758
BUT THEY STILL HAVE TO REGISTER
A FLIGHT PLAN.

20:46.870 --> 20:50.909
IF HIS PLANE TOOK OFF
OR LANDED HERE, YOU'D
HAVE IT ON FILE, RIGHT?

20:51.010 --> 20:52.739
USUALLY.

20:52.850 --> 20:55.239
WELL, UM...
(clears throat)...

20:55.350 --> 20:57.784
THINK YOU COULD
HELP US OUT?

21:17.670 --> 21:21.470
THE LAST TIME THE PLANE
LEFT THIS AIRFIELD
WAS THE NIGHT OF THE FIRE.

21:21.580 --> 21:23.445
WHERE'S THAT
DESTINATION CODE?

21:23.550 --> 21:25.939
LOOKS LIKE
A REGIONAL AIRPORT
IN DELAWARE.

21:26.050 --> 21:28.518
IT'S NOWHERE NEAR THORNHILL.
NO PASSENGERS,

21:28.620 --> 21:30.611
PILOT'S NAME IS JOHN SMITH.

21:30.720 --> 21:33.553
SURE IT IS.
AND I'M POCAHONTAS.

21:33.990 --> 21:35.753
SO, UH,

21:37.220 --> 21:38.528
LET'S JUST SAY THAT
THIS PLANE MAYBE WANTED
TO STOP SOMEWHERE ELSE.

21:39.430 --> 21:41.591
LIKE THORNHILL.
YEAH, LET'S JUST SUPPOSE.

21:41.700 --> 21:45.864
THEY'D INFORM
AIR TRAFFIC CONTROL.
OR NOT. DEPENDS.

21:45.970 --> 21:48.939
THIS GUY MAY NOT WANT
PEOPLE KNOWING WHERE HE WENT.

21:49.040 --> 21:52.339
WE GOT NOTHIN'.
DIFFERENT FLIGHT PLAN,
NO GIRL ONBOARD.

21:52.440 --> 21:56.035
AH. SO IT'S NOT
ABOUT A KITCHEN--
IT'S ABOUT A GIRL.

21:56.140 --> 21:58.506
TO BE HONEST, THERE WAS
A LOT OF FOG THAT NIGHT,

21:58.610 --> 22:00.669
AND THORNHILL'S BARELY
A LANDING STRIP.

22:00.780 --> 22:02.611
IT WOULD HAVE BEEN
REALLY HARD TO LAND THERE

22:02.720 --> 22:04.688
UNDER THOSE CONDITIONS
IN THE DARK.

22:04.790 --> 22:06.678
SORRY.

22:06.790 --> 22:09.657
ALL RIGHT. WELL, THANK YOU
FOR THE INFORMATION.

22:09.760 --> 22:11.022
HOPE YOU FIND
YOUR GIRL.

22:17.700 --> 22:19.065
( dials phone )

22:26.710 --> 22:29.406
I WISH I'D KEPT MY MOUTH SHUT.

22:29.510 --> 22:31.705
HANNA KNOWS
IT DOESN'T LOOK GOOD.

22:31.810 --> 22:33.744
THE QUESTION IS,
CAN IT GET ANY WORSE?

22:33.850 --> 22:36.614
HANNA'S MOM, EMILY'S PARENTS,
MY MOM, AND NOW MY BROTHER?

22:38.590 --> 22:40.683
YOU THINK "A" TOOK A BAT
TO CONNOR'S CAR?

22:40.790 --> 22:43.350
PLEASE. THIS HAS "A"
SPRAY-PAINTED ALL OVER IT.

22:43.460 --> 22:45.587
COME ON, GUYS. LET'S GO.

22:45.690 --> 22:48.727
TO YOUR DOCTOR'S
APPOINTMENT?

22:48.830 --> 22:50.559
EMILY,
IT'S JUST A SHOT.

22:52.130 --> 22:53.461
THIS IS ABOUT WHO SHOT WILDEN.
WE STILL HAVE TIME TO FIND
ANOTHER MURDER SUSPECT.

22:53.570 --> 22:55.094
ANY MAYBE SAVE
HANNA'S MOM?

22:55.200 --> 22:56.565
WHATEVER IT IS, WE'RE IN.
GOOD--

22:56.670 --> 22:59.036
'CAUSE WE'RE BREAKING IN
TO WILDEN'S APARTMENT.

23:06.650 --> 23:09.574
( key rattles in lock)

23:09.680 --> 23:11.580
( door opens )

23:14.890 --> 23:18.485
LOOKS LIKE HIS APARTMENT'S
AS MESSY AS HIS POLICE WORK.

23:18.590 --> 23:20.797
THE INVESTIGATORS
PROBABLY TURNED THIS PLACE OVER
A FEW TIMES.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.754
I DON'T THINK THIS MESS
IS ALL HIM.

23:22.860 --> 23:24.589
THEY THE ONES WHO LEFT
HIS BOXES ON THE FLOOR TOO?

23:24.700 --> 23:26.668
LIGHTS STAY OFF,
REMEMBER.

23:26.770 --> 23:28.658
AND TRY AND PUT THINGS BACK
WHERE YOU FOUND THEM

23:28.770 --> 23:30.761
IN CASE THE POLICE
COME BACK AGAIN.
ARIA, GLOVES.

23:30.870 --> 23:32.428
OH.

23:35.680 --> 23:37.033
HERE.

23:37.140 --> 23:39.449
I'M NOT LITERALLY
DIGGING FOR CLUES.

23:39.550 --> 23:41.575
I GRABBED
WHAT I COULD FIND.

23:41.680 --> 23:44.080
LOOK FOR LETTERS, PICTURES--
ANYTHING THAT MIGHT CONNECT
WILDEN TO SHANA AND JENNA.

23:44.190 --> 23:47.614
I STILL THINK THEY'RE GONNA
BE OUR BEST SHOT AT SAVING
HANNA'S MOM.

23:47.720 --> 23:50.780
THE BEDROOM'S OVER HERE.

23:50.890 --> 23:53.757
( phone rings )

23:53.860 --> 23:56.795
IT'S PROBABLY JUST
A TELEMARKETER.

23:58.700 --> 24:01.692
( ringing )

24:01.800 --> 24:02.539
DO WE PICK IT UP? OR--

24:02.640 --> 24:04.665
IT'LL STOP WHEN IT
GOES TO VOICEMAIL.

24:07.640 --> 24:09.505
( ringing )

24:10.750 --> 24:12.945
( ring c
uts
SEE? Off)

24:13.050 --> 24:14.608
KEEP LOOKING.

24:23.730 --> 24:25.982
I'M BLITZED.
I'M GONNA HEAD HOME
AND GET SOME REST.

24:26.090 --> 24:27.728
YOU CAN CRASH HERE
IF YOU WANT.

24:31.800 --> 24:33.734
IS SOMETHING
BUGGING YOU?

24:33.840 --> 24:35.831
(exhales) THE FOG.

24:35.940 --> 24:37.703
HOW'D HE KNOW
IT WAS FOGGY THAT NIGHT?

24:37.810 --> 24:41.007
MAYBE 'CAUSE HE'S LANDED THERE
BEFORE?

24:42.840 --> 24:44.876
YOU KNOW, AND THE PILOT,
THAT JOHN SMITH--

24:44.980 --> 24:47.540
NAME NEVER LED ANYWHERE
EITHER.

24:47.650 --> 24:50.847
I TRIED TO TRACE DOWN
THE OWNER OF THE PLANE,
BUT IT'S IN A TRUST.

24:50.950 --> 24:52.747
SOMEBODY'S BLOWING
A LOT OF SMOKE.

24:55.290 --> 24:57.485
WHAT DO YOU MAKE OF THIS?

25:00.900 --> 25:04.620
UH, THE "NW" IS BIGGER--
"NORTHWEST."

25:06.570 --> 25:08.231
OR "NIGEL WRIGHT."

25:08.340 --> 25:11.730
AND WITH THE COMPASS
I KEPT THINKING "SAILOR."
BUT IT COULD MEAN "PILOT."

25:11.840 --> 25:15.173
WHERE DID YOU GET THIS?
I FOUND IT AT THE LODGE
THAT NIGHT.

25:15.280 --> 25:17.908
I FIGURED WHOEVER
STARTED THE FIRE
PROBABLY USED THAT,

25:18.010 --> 25:20.103
BUT I COULDN'T DO
MUCH ELSE WITH IT.

25:20.210 --> 25:22.872
WE WERE ALL THERE. IF I WOULD
HAVE TURNED IT OVER TO THE COPS,

25:22.980 --> 25:25.517
TH ERE'D BE QUESTIONS--
LOTS.

25:25.620 --> 25:27.781
SO YOU THINK
HE STARTED THE FIRE?

25:27.890 --> 25:29.710
WELL, LIKE YOU SAID,

25:29.820 --> 25:31.788
SOMEBODY'S BLOWING
A LOT OF SMOKE.

25:31.890 --> 25:34.256
I'M GUESSING
IT'S OUR BUDDY NIGEL.

25:36.800 --> 25:39.894
KITCHEN'S CLEAR.
I GOT NOTHING.

25:40.000 --> 25:41.763
YEAH, MAIL'S
PRETTY TAME.

25:41.870 --> 25:42.859
IT'S JUST JUNK, BILLS.

25:42.970 --> 25:45.768
I FEEL WEIRD
TOUCHING HIS STUFF
EVEN WITH GLOVES ON.

25:45.870 --> 25:47.872
COME UP WITH ANYTHING?
NOT A LOT,

25:47.980 --> 25:51.199
JUST SOME FAMILY PHOTOS,
LOTS AND LOTS OF BLACK SOCKS

25:51.310 --> 25:53.949
AND HIS, UH...
FILM COLLECTION.

25:54.050 --> 25:57.816
WILDEN'S A FILM BUFF?
WHAT, LIKE CLASSICS?

25:57.920 --> 26:02.789
YEAH, IF YOU CONSIDER
"LORD OF THE G-STRINGS"
A CLASSIC.
( Spencer laughs )

26:02.890 --> 26:05.927
IT'S WEIRD, THOUGH,
THERE'S NO PLANTS, NO ART,

26:06.030 --> 26:08.794
THERE'S NOT A LOT OF,
LIKE, KNICK-KNACKS
OR PERSONAL STUFF.

26:08.900 --> 26:11.824
I THINK WHAT I FOUND
WAS PRETTY PERSONAL.
SPENCER'S RIGHT.

26:11.930 --> 26:14.160
IT'S LIKE HE CAME HERE TO EAT,
SLEEP AND CHANGE HIS SOCKS.

26:14.270 --> 26:16.830
I THINK HE DID A LITTLE MORE
THAN JUST CHANGE HIS SOCKS.

26:16.940 --> 26:18.339
AND THEY WEREN'T EVEN
UNDER HIS SOCKS--

26:18.440 --> 26:19.964
THEY WERE JUST STACKED
ON HIS NIGHTSTAND LIKE,

26:21.240 --> 26:22.935
"HMM. WHAT DO I WANT
TO WATCH TONIGHT--
JIMMY KIMMEL OR BOOBS?"

26:24.250 --> 26:25.808
ARIA, FOCUS.
WE ALREADY KNEW THAT
WILDEN WAS A CREEP, OKAY?

26:25.910 --> 26:26.842
AND WHAT ARE WE MISSING?

26:27.950 --> 26:29.975
DID YOU CHECK THAT BOX?

26:31.990 --> 26:33.958
I DIDN'T EVEN SEE THAT.

26:34.060 --> 26:36.813
MIGHT BE A GIFT.
THAT'S PRETTY PERSONAL.

26:38.260 --> 26:40.319
THIS IS FROM
THAT FANCY STEAK COMPANY

26:40.430 --> 26:43.228
MY DAD ALWAYS GETS FROM
MY UNCLE FOR HIS BIRTHDAY.

26:51.010 --> 26:53.228
A||: OHH!
GOD, THAT'S RIPE!

26:56.140 --> 26:58.608
I DON'T SEE A NOTE
OR ANYTHING.

26:58.710 --> 27:00.974
OH, MY GOD,
IT'S MAKING MY EYES WATER.

27:11.230 --> 27:13.027
"CAN'T WAIT TO SEE YOU
AT OUR LITTLE BARBECUE.

27:13.130 --> 27:14.859
KISSES, 'A.'"

Ezra: ARIA.

28:49.120 --> 28:52.123
ARE YOU HERE
TO SEE MR. HACKETT?

28:52.230 --> 28:55.996
NO. NO, I'M HERE
FOR MIKE.

28:56.100 --> 28:57.988
HE'S IN THERE
WITH MY DAD

28:58.100 --> 29:01.399
AND...CONNOR
AND CONNOR'S DAD.

29:01.500 --> 29:05.004
I SAW THE CAR.
MIKE COULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT.

29:05.110 --> 29:07.101
THEY'RE SAYING
THAT HE DID.

29:07.210 --> 29:11.101
MIKE'S IN THERE GETTING
RAILROADED, AND HACKETT'S
JUST LETTING IT HAPPEN.

29:11.210 --> 29:13.269
THEY'RE ACTUALLY
FILING A POLICE REPORT.
IF MIKE GETS EXPELLED--

29:13.380 --> 29:16.019
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN--
NOT IF HE DIDN'T DO IT.

29:20.920 --> 29:24.128
ARIA, I GET IT--
WHAT YOU SAID.

29:24.230 --> 29:28.018
I CAN'T BE THE ONE
TO SWOOP IN AND COMFORT YOU.

29:30.160 --> 29:32.025
BUT IT KILLS ME--
I KNOW.

29:34.940 --> 29:38.159
ANYWAY, HACKETT'S SAYING
THAT MIKE'S CRAZY
AND THAT HE'S OFF HIS MEDS.

29:38.270 --> 29:41.137
I THOUGHT HE WAS GONNA
ASK ME TO COUNT THE PILLS
IN HIS PRESCRIPTION BOTTLE.

29:41.240 --> 29:45.040
DID HE ASK YOU THAT?
DIRECTLY?

29:48.180 --> 29:51.343
ARIA, DO YOU KNOW
WHO REALLY DID THIS?

29:54.560 --> 29:56.050
( sighs )

29:57.190 --> 29:59.181
EZRA.
BYRON.

29:59.290 --> 30:02.453
UM, ARIA'S BEEN TELLING ME
WHAT'S BEEN GOING ON.

30:02.560 --> 30:04.562
IF THERE'S ANYTHING
THAT I CAN DO...

30:04.670 --> 30:07.491
NO, THANKS.
I APPRECIATE THAT OFFER.

30:07.600 --> 30:11.468
ARIA, WHY DON'T YOU
GO BACK HOME AND WAIT.
WE'LL SEE YOU BACK THERE.

30:40.970 --> 30:43.438
YOU COME SEE ME
IN MY OFFICE
WHEN YOU'RE DONE.

30:50.280 --> 30:53.499
SHE DOESN'T FIND THAT KEY,
WE'RE GONNA HAVE A PROBLEM.

30:58.390 --> 31:01.848
Toby: DID YOU LOSE
SOMETHING?
I DON'T SMOKE.

31:01.960 --> 31:04.383
A LIGHTER MIGHT COME IN HANDY
FOR OTHER THINGS.

31:05.990 --> 31:08.129
WOW, HE WAS SUCH
A CHATTERBOX YESTERDAY.

31:08.230 --> 31:10.289
I WONDER WHAT HAPPENED.

31:15.340 --> 31:18.537
GUYS, LISTEN--
YOU'RE THE PILOT, RIGHT?
JOHN SMITH?

31:18.640 --> 31:21.200
YOU FILED THAT FLIGHT PLAN
TO DELAWARE AS COVER,

31:21.310 --> 31:23.278
LANDED AT THORNHILL
IN THE FOG,

31:23.380 --> 31:25.348
DELIVERED A BLOND GIRL
IN A RED COAT,

31:25.450 --> 31:27.270
AND THEN YOU FLEW HER
OUT OF THERE.
WHO IS SHE, NIGEL?

31:27.380 --> 31:30.144
I DON'T KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT A FIRE. I WASN'T THERE.

31:35.290 --> 31:38.179
JUST--I GOT PAID
TO FAKE A FLIGHT PLAN.

31:38.290 --> 31:41.350
OKAY? AND SPIN A LITTLE STORY
IF SOMEONE CAME ASKING.
THAT'S ALL.

31:41.460 --> 31:43.325
BY WHO?
WAS IT HER?
THE BLOND?

31:43.430 --> 31:45.295
I'LL GIVE YOU
YOUR MONEY BACK, OKAY?
I JUST GOT GREEDY.

31:45.400 --> 31:46.367
WE ARE GONNA NEED A NAME.

31:47.230 --> 31:49.289
I COULD LOSE MY JOB!
I BROKE THE LAW!

31:49.400 --> 31:50.435
JUST...

31:52.440 --> 31:54.305
HER NAME WAS--

31:54.410 --> 31:56.628
I DON'T KNOW.
DRAKE. CECE, I THINK.

31:56.740 --> 31:59.345
JUST TAKE THE MONEY
AND DROP IT, ALL RIGHT?

32:06.390 --> 32:09.052
LET HIM GO!

32:09.160 --> 32:12.926
THAT GUY WAS NEVER
GONNA TELL US
THE WHOLE STORY ANYWAY.

32:13.030 --> 32:15.055
BUT MAYBE THIS WILL.

32:22.400 --> 32:24.334
Hackett: YES, OF COURSE.

32:24.440 --> 32:26.328
I UNDERSTAND.

32:26.440 --> 32:29.329
MR. HACKETT,
MAY I HAVE A WORD?

32:29.440 --> 32:32.204
CAN'T IT WAIT? I'M RATHER
IN THE MIDDLE OF SOMETHING.
IT'S ACTUALLY ABOUT THIS.

32:32.310 --> 32:34.972
PLEASE. IT WILL ONLY
TAKE A MOMENT.

32:36.480 --> 32:39.347
OFFICER,
MAY I CALL YOU BACK?

32:39.450 --> 32:41.384
YES. I WILL.

32:41.490 --> 32:42.479
THANK YOU.

32:42.590 --> 32:44.080
( disconnects )

32:44.190 --> 32:45.350
WE'RE VERY CLOSE
TO A SOLUTION HERE.

32:46.430 --> 32:47.283
UNLESS YOU'VE GOT
SOMETHING COMPELLING TO ADD--

32:47.390 --> 32:50.029
DID ANYONE ACTUALLY
WITNESS THIS HAPPENING?

32:50.130 --> 32:53.668
CAN ANYONE BESIDES CONNOR
SAY FOR CERTAIN THAT MIKE
WAS AT FAULT?

32:53.770 --> 32:56.238
THE SCHOOL HAS A ZERO TOLERANCE
POLICY TOWARD VIOLENCE.

32:56.340 --> 32:59.639
ATTACKING ANOTHER PERSON
OR THEIR PROPERTY--
ALLEGEDLY.

32:59.740 --> 33:03.369
I'M TRYING TO SEE THAT
HE DOESN'T GET CHARGES
PRESSED AGAINST HIM.

33:03.480 --> 33:06.506
IN EXCHANGE,
THERE'S GONNA HAVE TO BE
SOME KIND OF PUNISHMENT.

33:06.610 --> 33:10.376
THE OTHER FAMILY WON'T
COMPROMISE. I DON'T WANT
THE BOY TO SUFFER UNDULY.

33:10.480 --> 33:14.086
IT'S A GOOD THING
HIS MEDICAL HISTORY
HASN'T COME UP.

33:14.190 --> 33:17.387
I'D HATE TO SEE MIKE LABELED
AS MENTALLY UNSTABLE
AND A VANDAL.

33:17.490 --> 33:21.290
WELL, YOU DON'T THINK
THAT'S PERTINENT INFORMATION
TO CONSIDER?

33:21.400 --> 33:24.198
MAYBE... IF YOU HADN'T
ASKED HIS SISTER.

33:24.300 --> 33:27.724
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE
THE CAN OF WORMS THAT
THAT WOULD OPEN UP

33:27.830 --> 33:30.037
IF THE PARENT FOUND OUT.

33:30.140 --> 33:32.631
LET ME STOP YOU
RIGHT THERE, EZRA.

33:32.740 --> 33:37.404
NOW, I CAN SEE WHERE
I MIGHT HAVE MADE
AN ERROR IN JUDGMENT.

33:37.510 --> 33:40.206
BUT I WONDER WHETHER
YOUR VERY PERSONAL BIAS

33:40.310 --> 33:42.346
WHERE THE MONTGOMERY FAMILY
IS CONCERNED

33:42.450 --> 33:44.247
ISN'T AN ERROR IN YOURS.

33:49.190 --> 33:50.589
( computer beeps )

33:50.690 --> 33:53.124
OKAY, WE'RE THROUGH
HIS PASSWORD.

33:53.230 --> 33:56.222
LOOK AT ALL THOSE CALLS
TO THE SAME NUMBER IN NEW YORK.

33:56.330 --> 34:00.426
AND LOOK AT THE LAST ONE.
THAT WAS RIGHT AFTER
WE LEFT THE AIRFIELD.

34:00.530 --> 34:04.660
SO YOU THINK THAT
THIS IS WHERE CECE DRAKE WENT
WHEN SHE LEFT TOWN?

34:04.770 --> 34:07.466
I CAN GET INTO IT
AND SEE WHAT I CAN FIND OUT.

34:07.570 --> 34:11.142
BUT WHY WOULD SHE WANT TO
RUIN ASHLEY MARIN?
OR HURT HANNA?

34:11.250 --> 34:12.808
OR THE REST OF YOU,
FOR THAT MATTER.

34:12.910 --> 34:15.470
COULD SHE HAVE
HELPED WILDEN
SET THAT FIRE?

34:15.580 --> 34:17.673
OR WAS WILDEN HELPING HER?

34:17.780 --> 34:20.385
SHE SAID SHE WAS
LEAVING TOWN BECAUSE
SHE WAS AFRAID OF WILDEN.

34:20.490 --> 34:25.518
SO MAYBE THE TRUTH IS
THAT THEY SET THE FIRE,
SHE KILLED WILDEN,

34:25.630 --> 34:28.394
AND THIS SET-UP IS HER
COVERING HER OWN TRACKS.

34:28.500 --> 34:31.264
CAN YOU THINK OF
A REASON TO BELIEVE
SHE'S NOT "A"?

34:31.370 --> 34:34.533
TOBY, CECE VISITED MONA
WHEN SHE WAS IN RADLEY.

34:37.370 --> 34:40.430
CAN YOU GIVE US
A MINUTE?

34:40.540 --> 34:42.508
YEAH, JUST DON'T START
MAKING OUT OR ANYTHING.

34:42.610 --> 34:45.408
(laughs) BELIEVE ME,
I MISSED HIM WHILE YOU TWO
WERE PLAYING HARDY BOYS,

34:45.510 --> 34:47.501
BUT NOW IS NOT THE TIME.

34:50.520 --> 34:54.217
HOW LONG AGO DID YOU FIND OUT
ABOUT CECE GOING
TO VISIT RADLEY?

34:54.320 --> 34:56.550
RIGHT BEFORE I LEFT THERE.

34:56.660 --> 34:58.480
I FOUND HER VISITOR'S PASS
IN MONA'S STASH.

34:58.590 --> 35:01.593
DR. PALMER SAID TO
WATCH OUT FOR THE BLOND GIRL.

35:01.700 --> 35:04.521
ANY CHANCE THAT
HE MEANT CECE?

35:04.630 --> 35:09.397
YOU SAID HE WAS IN AND OUT,
BUT MAYBE HE WASN'T AS OUT
AS YOU THOUGHT.

35:09.500 --> 35:12.537
CECE COULD HAVE
GOTTEN HER HANDS ON
YOUR MOTHER'S RECORDS.

35:12.640 --> 35:16.269
WE WON'T KNOW FOR SURE
UNTIL WE FIND HER.

35:27.790 --> 35:30.452
YOU'RE A CRAP LIAR.
YOU DO KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

35:30.560 --> 35:32.528
EXCUSE ME?
VIDEO-CHATTING WITH MOM?

35:32.630 --> 35:35.451
COME ON. THEY COULD
HAVE CHECKED THAT.

35:37.500 --> 35:40.321
WE GOT SAUSAGE KING
ON THE WAY HOME.

35:40.430 --> 35:42.261
THAT SOUND LIKE
A CELEBRATION.

35:42.370 --> 35:44.167
W-WHAT HAPPENED?

35:44.270 --> 35:46.135
ACTUALLY,
MR. FITZ HAPPENED.

35:46.240 --> 35:48.128
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

35:48.240 --> 35:50.435
HE TALKED TO HACKETT,
AND THE NEXT THING I KNOW,

35:50.540 --> 35:51.802
HACKETT'S TELLING CONNOR
AND HIS DAD

35:51.910 --> 35:54.413
THAT IF THE POLICE
HAVE NO PRINTS OR WITNESSES,

35:54.520 --> 35:56.476
HE'S GOT NO REASON
TO EXPEL ME.

35:57.680 --> 35:59.819
NOW I KINDA WISH
I HAD DONE IT.

35:59.920 --> 36:01.751
OR DONE SOMETHING.

36:01.860 --> 36:03.748
COME ON, MIKE.
THAT'S NOT YOU.

36:03.860 --> 36:05.623
MAYBE IT SHOULD BE.

36:05.730 --> 36:08.790
IF ANYTHING LIKE THIS
HAPPENS TO YOU AGAIN,
I WANT TO BE READY.

36:10.860 --> 36:12.566
NOW COME EAT.

36:26.410 --> 36:27.604
EMILY?

36:29.680 --> 36:31.318
WHAT ARE YOU UP TO?

36:31.420 --> 36:33.638
JUST DOING SOME HOMEWORK.

36:33.750 --> 36:35.581
THE CLINIC CALLED.

36:35.690 --> 36:38.488
YOU RESCHEDULED
YOUR APPOINTMENT?

36:38.590 --> 36:41.798
I HAD SOMETHING TO DO.
FOR HANNA.

36:41.900 --> 36:45.563
I KNOW YOUR FRIEND IS IN
A TERRIBLE SITUATION,

36:45.670 --> 36:47.626
BUT THIS IS JUST AS IMPORTANT.

36:47.730 --> 36:49.698
IF YOU EVER WANT TO
BE ABLE TQ BVé/lIM AGAIN--

36:49.800 --> 36:52.507
THEN TAKE IT SERIOUSLY1

36:55.280 --> 36:58.909
I'M GONNA BRING YOU TO THE
APPOINTMENT MYSELF TOMORROW.

36:59.010 --> 37:01.717
I'M SORRY, MOM, OKAY?

37:01.820 --> 37:04.618
DO YOU WANT ME TO MEET YOU
AT WORK AGAIN TOMORROW?

37:07.420 --> 37:10.685
NO. I WON'T BE AT WORK.

37:11.790 --> 37:14.497
I WAS SUSPENDED TODAY.

37:17.060 --> 37:19.699
JUST...FINISH YOUR HOMEWORK.

37:19.800 --> 37:21.734
I GOTTA CALL YOUR DAD.

37:45.590 --> 37:47.751
( knocking on door)

37:49.800 --> 37:51.893

37:53.670 --> 37:58.664
* THERE'S A SOUND
AS YOUR BREATHING SLOWS *

37:58.770 --> 38:03.332
* AS THE STILLNESS
AROUND YOU GROWS *

38:03.440 --> 38:05.670
* THERE'S A SOUND...

38:09.520 --> 38:11.784
TWICE IN ONE DAY.

38:11.890 --> 38:12.811
( chuckles )

38:14.460 --> 38:16.781
I WAS JUST LEAVING
A THANK YOU NOTE.

38:16.890 --> 38:19.654
UM, EMAIL FELT
A LITTLE IMPERSONAL.

38:21.660 --> 38:24.663
IT ALL FEELS IMPERSONAL
LATELY.

38:27.500 --> 38:30.663
I'M REALLY GLAD
YOU SWOOPED.

38:30.770 --> 38:33.534
YOU KNOW THERE ISN'T ANYTHING
I WOULDN'T DO FOR YOU, RIGHT?

38:42.380 --> 38:43.711
I GOTTA GO.

38:46.820 --> 38:48.481
( sighs )

38:52.460 --> 38:54.849
SELF-DEFENSE?

38:54.960 --> 38:56.951
MOM, YOU HAVE TO PLEAD GUILTY
AND SAY THAT'S WHAT IT WAS.

38:57.060 --> 38:59.790
SELF-DEFENSE.
THERE'S NO OTHER WAY.

39:01.000 --> 39:03.730
YOU KNOW
I DIDN'T DO THIS.
I KNOW.

39:03.840 --> 39:06.559
THEN WHY?!
IF THE CHOICE IS BETWEEN
LOSING YOU FOR TWENTY YEARS

39:06.670 --> 39:08.831
AND LOSING YOU FOREVER,
I'LL TAKE THE TWENTY YEARS.

39:08.940 --> 39:12.740
AND I KNOW YOU WILL TOO
IF IT MEANS THAT SOMEDAY
WE'LL BE TOGETHER AGAIN.

39:12.850 --> 39:15.478
NO, HANNA, I WON'T!
NOT WHEN WE BOTH KNOW--

39:15.580 --> 39:16.808
MOM, LOOK WHERE WE ARE.

39:16.920 --> 39:19.445
WE KNOW THE TRUTH.
WE KNOW YOU WERE SET UP.

39:19.550 --> 39:21.711
BUT NOBODY ELSE
IS BUYING IT.

39:23.090 --> 39:25.354
LISTEN TO ME, HANNA.

39:27.130 --> 39:29.826
I CAN ACCEPT RESPONSIBILITY
FOR THE CHOICES I MADE THAT PUT
DARREN WILDEN IN OUR WAY.

39:29.930 --> 39:33.366
BUT I WILL NOT ADMIT TO
A MURDER I DIDN'T COMMIT!

39:33.470 --> 39:36.735
HE DOESN'T GET TO DIE
AND LEAVE ME LOOKING
LIKE A CRIMINAL.

39:36.840 --> 39:38.137
( buzzer, door opens )

39:50.880 --> 39:52.484
( door closes )

39:57.920 --> 40:00.753
CALEB-- THAT'S THE GUY
WITH THE LONG HAIR?--

40:00.860 --> 40:03.897
I THINK HE'S THE ONE
THAT TOOK MY PHONE.

40:04.000 --> 40:05.627
IT'S LADY GREY TEA,
RIGHT?

40:08.670 --> 40:10.797
I'M SORRY.
I SCREWED UP.

40:11.870 --> 40:13.667
CAREFUL, BABE.
IT'S HOT.

40:52.810 --> 40:55.517
Pam: YEAH. WITHOUT PAY.

40:56.950 --> 40:58.815
I-I DON'T KNOW HOW LONG.

40:58.920 --> 41:01.582
I MEAN, IT'S EITHER GONNA BE
UNTIL THEY FIND THAT KEY,

41:01.690 --> 41:03.453
OR DECIDE THAT I'M AT FAULT.

41:03.560 --> 41:06.779
(sighs) WAYNE, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO DO.

41:06.890 --> 41:09.199
I MEAN, SHOULD I BE LOOKING
FOR SOMETHING ELSE?

41:13.000 --> 41:14.194
NO.

41:16.000 --> 41:18.707
NO, HONEY.

41:18.810 --> 41:22.735
LOOK, YOU AND I BOTH KNOW
THAT WE CAN'T AFFORD FOR ME
NOT TO BE WORKING.

41:25.610 --> 41:26.838
YEAH.

41:29.020 --> 41:31.887
N-NO. NO, NO.
1--

41:31.990 --> 41:33.139
I DON'T KNOW.

41:33.250 --> 41:34.888
YOU KNOW WHAT?
I SUPPOSE

41:34.990 --> 41:37.959
WE COULD JUST USE
THE EMERGENCY CREDIT CARD
IN THE SHORT TERM.

41:38.060 --> 41:39.880
RIGHT?

41:39.990 --> 41:41.218
( car approaches )
OH, MY.

41:43.030 --> 41:44.759
( engine rewing )

41:44.870 --> 41:46.064
( Pam screams )

41:49.000 --> 41:51.036
( horn honks continuously)
Emily: OH, MY GOD!

41:51.140 --> 41:53.005
MOM!

41:53.110 --> 41:54.168
( gasps )

41:54.270 --> 41:55.908
MOM!!!

41:56.010 --> 41:59.002
MOM! MOM, ARE YOU OKAY?!
YEAH.

41:59.110 --> 42:01.044
COME ON. COME ON.
COME ON.

42:01.150 --> 42:02.913
COME ON.

42:06.050 --> 42:08.280
( horn continues )

42:22.670 --> 42:26.800
( in-store music plays,
power tool whines )

43:08.980 --> 43:11.813
