A FILM BY MAARIT LALLI

00:12.990 --> 00:16.070
Imagine we're flies in our next life.

00:21.080 --> 00:24.040
Watching ourselves
from the ceiling.

00:26.080 --> 00:28.250
Watching what we're doing.

00:33.470 --> 00:35.890
What are you afraid of?

00:40.520 --> 00:42.180
Ricky?

00:44.940 --> 00:47.520
Tell me.

00:50.570 --> 00:55.570
Talk to me. For once.

01:00.240 --> 01:03.250
I don't know
which I'm more afraid of;

01:06.040 --> 01:11.960
that there's nothing after death
or that there's something.

01:19.550 --> 01:23.480
I don't think I could deal
with all this all over again.

02:20.660 --> 02:23.200
I can't let you walk.
You'll sneak off.

02:23.330 --> 02:26.040
Good morning,
Ira-Sofia and Luna!

02:26.160 --> 02:29.830
How did your day start off?
- Very well, thanks.

02:29.960 --> 02:31.630
Let me take you.

02:31.750 --> 02:34.250
You got an even better start
with the weather.

02:36.670 --> 02:38.680
Bye bye, Ira!
- Bye!

02:38.800 --> 02:40.890
Enjoy!

02:47.520 --> 02:49.350
Hi, Mom. Where are you?

02:49.480 --> 02:52.190
Hi, sweetie. Call me
when you get out of school.

02:52.310 --> 02:54.400
I'm at work, so I can't talk.

02:54.520 --> 02:56.820
Okay? Kisses. Bye.

03:04.080 --> 03:05.740
APARTMENT SHOWING

03:31.350 --> 03:33.270
We had a normal morning.

03:33.400 --> 03:35.230
We overslept.

03:36.480 --> 03:39.280
I found your ring.

04:08.770 --> 04:10.520
Alrighty.-

04:11.640 --> 04:15.810
How are you?
- I'm good, Dad.

04:15.940 --> 04:21.029
When apartments sell, real estate
agents are happy. - Right.

04:22.530 --> 04:25.200
I've followed the subject all night.

04:25.700 --> 04:31.120
The woman just appeared
on the balcony with a male.

04:31.250 --> 04:34.750
Take photos, send them
to the client with an invoice.

04:35.580 --> 04:40.090
Private Detective Lahti,
Case Number 2 closed.

04:56.440 --> 04:58.110
Hey!

05:00.530 --> 05:02.820
What are you doing here?

05:09.830 --> 05:11.950
What are you...
- Quiet.

05:12.080 --> 05:15.670
Or people will think
I kidnap women from the street.

05:17.420 --> 05:20.210
You make me
come out in the daylight.

05:20.340 --> 05:23.670
Drive around the block. Damn.

05:23.800 --> 05:27.640
I've told you numerous times
that you need professional help.

05:27.760 --> 05:32.600
That's what I'm asking from you.
- I mean mental health help.

05:33.140 --> 05:36.900
Go to the Yrjönkatu Swimming Pool.
She's there at the moment.

05:37.020 --> 05:40.610
Report everything. I'll pay cash.

05:47.910 --> 05:51.030
Hi.
- Hi.

06:03.960 --> 06:06.470
There's no water.

06:10.430 --> 06:13.010
The refrigerator is broken.

06:13.720 --> 06:17.810
Either they're
renovating this building, -

06:17.940 --> 06:20.730
or this collapsed infrastructure is -

06:20.860 --> 06:24.940
a reflection of
the state of your soul.

06:25.070 --> 06:28.150
Did you pay the rent?
- It's your turn.

06:28.280 --> 06:30.280
I'll lie here and cry -

06:30.410 --> 06:35.120
for another seven minutes.
You don't have to react.

06:35.250 --> 06:38.870
You sure?
- Yeah. I'll take care of this.

07:01.060 --> 07:06.070
Upstairs or downstairs?
- Which has a better view?

07:06.190 --> 07:10.280
What did you come here to look at?
- I mean generally.

07:10.410 --> 07:13.660
Here you swim,
not look at people.

07:17.160 --> 07:19.330
I'll come back another clay.

07:19.830 --> 07:24.380
You bought me lunch
and everything.

07:24.500 --> 07:27.960
Next time is on me.
- That'll be next year then.

07:28.090 --> 07:30.970
We'll make this an annual tradition.
- Sure.

07:31.090 --> 07:34.970
Bye bye, darling. Take care. Bye!
- Bye.

07:38.980 --> 07:41.980
How are you?
- I'm good!

07:42.100 --> 07:44.730
It's so great to see you!
- It sure is.

07:44.860 --> 07:47.110
What car is that?
- Isn't it nice?

07:47.230 --> 07:52.160
It's very nice.
- Alfa Romeo.

07:52.280 --> 07:54.450
It's an Alfa Romeo.
- Indeed.

07:54.570 --> 07:58.120
So, where do you want to go?
- Why don't you decide.

08:06.670 --> 08:08.670
Be my guest.

08:44.370 --> 08:46.040
Fuck. Shit.

08:46.170 --> 08:50.710
Are you okay?
- Fuck. Thanks, I'm okay.

08:53.340 --> 08:58.640
Have we bumped into each
other before? - We just did.

08:58.760 --> 09:02.310
I mean, have we met before?
Like, met met?

09:04.100 --> 09:06.770
I wouldn't forget
a baseball cap like that.

09:07.480 --> 09:12.150
You're here to see the apartment?
Ricky Kalin. - Annika.

09:13.650 --> 09:16.700
Have you been
apartment-hunting long?

09:18.950 --> 09:22.620
A couple of weeks.
- That's nothing.

09:47.440 --> 09:52.730
Divorces are our number one,
numero uno, niche.

09:56.820 --> 09:59.740
You know what's the next biggest?
- What?

10:00.370 --> 10:02.450
Estates .

10:09.920 --> 10:14.130
This is a pretty incredible
apartment. - Yeah.

10:15.470 --> 10:18.050
High ceilings.
- Yeah.

10:18.180 --> 10:20.350
Really big windows.

10:24.470 --> 10:27.060
Guess what street that is.

10:28.940 --> 10:33.400
Korkeavuorenkatu Street.
But I guess you knew that.

10:33.520 --> 10:38.280
You can see Pieni Roobertinkatu
Street from the other window.

10:39.860 --> 10:42.280
Where are the kitchen facilities?

10:42.410 --> 10:46.120
Kitchen facilities?
They're here on the left.

10:49.000 --> 10:50.790
Well well.

10:55.170 --> 10:57.220
You like cooking?

11:00.050 --> 11:01.720
Err...

11:02.930 --> 11:10.190
Are you familiar with
gas stoves like this? - Yeah.

11:10.310 --> 11:12.770
It's very efficient.

11:12.900 --> 11:17.440
You can cook things really quick.

11:18.030 --> 11:22.410
Like what?
- Rice, pasta, potatoes.

11:22.530 --> 11:26.410
I don't eat carbohydrates
at the moment.

11:26.540 --> 11:31.000
Eggs. Meat. Fish.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.630
Sushi. Whatever you like.

11:37.710 --> 11:40.840
I don't like anything raw myself.
- Oh.

11:40.970 --> 11:45.890
So you don't like oysters?
- No. I can't swallow anything...

11:46.010 --> 11:47.810
...that's alive?
- Yeah.

11:47.930 --> 11:50.180
That's interesting.

11:50.890 --> 11:55.230
I never had trouble swallowing
things that were alive.

11:58.320 --> 12:00.030
Okay.

12:02.450 --> 12:04.700
You have an info sheet -

12:04.820 --> 12:08.830
about what renovations
have been done in the building?

12:08.950 --> 12:12.040
You're interested in...
- In renovations.

12:12.170 --> 12:14.830
Well, it's good
to find out about them.

12:14.960 --> 12:21.550
A pipe renovation was done
2011 - 2012.

12:24.550 --> 12:26.760
Now I remember you.

12:27.680 --> 12:31.430
Of course I remember you.
You might've thought I didn't.

12:36.020 --> 12:38.230
At my place that one night.

12:38.360 --> 12:41.030
At your place?
- Yes, at my place.

12:41.150 --> 12:44.700
Sex without emotion.
You got what you wanted.

12:45.530 --> 12:48.950
I doubt either of us
was looking for love.

13:59.900 --> 14:02.940
That's it?
- That's it.

14:22.590 --> 14:24.300
Ricky Kalin.

14:25.380 --> 14:28.380
Hi. Sure, I have a moment.

14:29.720 --> 14:33.010
I'm in the Korkeavuorenkatu
Street apartment.

14:33.140 --> 14:35.980
But I'll be done soon.
Just a moment.

14:36.100 --> 14:38.520
Yeah, I think I'm done.

14:39.730 --> 14:43.360
I'll see you there
in fifteen minutes.

14:45.190 --> 14:46.900
Okay.

14:48.570 --> 14:50.570
Bye!

14:50.700 --> 14:54.040
Client Number 3:
Ulf Shostakovich.

14:54.160 --> 14:56.450
Former Member
of the European Parliament.

14:56.580 --> 15:00.290
Married to Brita,
his wife of ten years.

15:00.920 --> 15:03.170
Thinks his wife
is having an affair.

15:03.290 --> 15:05.420
Doubts my abilities
as a private detective.

15:05.550 --> 15:08.260
He's not totally wrong,
as the evidence is modest.

15:08.380 --> 15:11.340
Did Brita marry Ulf for money?
Is she fucking other men?

15:11.470 --> 15:14.890
Do old people say
"fuck" or "have sex"?

15:15.010 --> 15:18.520
The case was interrupted
because Mrs. Detective -

15:18.640 --> 15:22.480
tripped over
a real estate agent's sign.

15:22.610 --> 15:27.650
Annika, Annika, where's your focus?
Focus. Focus. Focus.

15:27.780 --> 15:30.240
Mrs. Marple should admit -

15:30.360 --> 15:34.280
she's having trouble
getting this case going.

15:37.410 --> 15:42.920
Brita, Brita, Brita.
Remember to buy Brie and pears.

15:43.040 --> 15:46.050
Vodka. Raw vodka.

15:46.840 --> 15:49.130
Now it's fixed.
- Fuck!

15:50.050 --> 15:53.180
You have water again.
- Okay.

15:53.300 --> 15:54.970
Bye!

15:58.680 --> 16:01.640
BULEVARDI REAL ESTATE

16:14.120 --> 16:17.410
Hi. Sorry.
Kaisa must've left already.

16:17.540 --> 16:20.790
I'm late because
we had trouble with the lights.

16:20.910 --> 16:24.830
I'm so late.
I ran for the tram but missed it.

16:24.960 --> 16:29.340
Then I realized I hadn't eaten
anything all clay. I'm starving.

16:29.460 --> 16:33.930
I feel like I'm gonna pass out.
Shit, there's no food here.

16:34.050 --> 16:37.140
Thanks for the roses.
They're really nice. - What?

16:37.260 --> 16:40.140
Thanks for the roses. They're lovely.

16:40.270 --> 16:42.890
You liked them, huh?
- Yes, I did.

16:43.020 --> 16:45.560
They were left over
from a wedding gig I did.

16:45.690 --> 16:50.190
There were, like, a thousand roses,
so I sent them to all my friends.

16:50.320 --> 16:53.110
He said it was his.

16:53.240 --> 16:57.120
He said there was a Volvo
hanging from a crane -

16:57.240 --> 17:00.830
at some shipyard.

17:01.450 --> 17:03.410
At a shipyard!

17:03.580 --> 17:05.420
Be quiet.

17:08.670 --> 17:10.339
We will be.

17:12.210 --> 17:15.130
Ulf, read my lips.

17:15.260 --> 17:18.930
In that photo, Brita and the man
are going to do you know what.

17:19.060 --> 17:22.390
This proves nothing.

17:22.520 --> 17:28.230
Women and men walk arm in arm
all the time. That's equality.

17:28.359 --> 17:33.030
That's why I was elected
to parliament in 1966.

17:33.150 --> 17:37.410
I wanted to promote equality
between the sexes.

17:37.530 --> 17:42.540
Finland is not
France or Italy, dammit.

17:42.660 --> 17:47.170
In France or Italy this would be
a clear case. Walking arm in arm.

17:47.290 --> 17:51.420
I told you I can't accept your case.

17:51.550 --> 17:54.130
You're my godfather.
We're too close.

17:54.260 --> 17:57.720
Brita will realize at some point
I'm following her.

17:57.840 --> 17:59.510
That would be embarrassing.

17:59.640 --> 18:02.810
I know you just started
your company.

18:02.930 --> 18:09.190
You have to work hard
for your clients. - Fine.

18:11.480 --> 18:16.400
Why does Brita keep seeing Mikkis?
He's my old buddy.

18:16.530 --> 18:21.160
Maybe she's maintaining your
friendships because you're too busy.

18:21.280 --> 18:24.540
Could you go to her
hairdresser's undercover?

18:24.660 --> 18:27.870
I'll find out when she has
an appointment.

18:28.000 --> 18:32.550
Your hair could use some work.

18:32.670 --> 18:38.180
Excuse me, but do you look
after yourself at all?

18:38.300 --> 18:40.390
Oh, I do.

18:43.810 --> 18:47.310
Whose idea was it
to meet in a champagne bar?

18:47.850 --> 18:51.230
In the middle of downtown
in broad daylight.

18:51.810 --> 18:54.400
People will recognize me.

18:54.530 --> 18:56.280
Your check, here you are.

18:56.400 --> 18:58.450
It was your idea.

19:13.590 --> 19:17.170
Will this wine give me a tan
like yours? Should I open it now?

19:17.300 --> 19:21.300
Is this where you hiked?
- Yes. Camino de Santiago.

19:21.430 --> 19:24.600
You actually hiked
the pilgrimage route?

19:24.720 --> 19:28.850
Did you go with a group of people?
- No, by myself.

19:28.980 --> 19:32.560
That's the thing a man who's
getting married should do.

19:32.690 --> 19:35.690
You look so good.
Tanned and slim.

19:35.820 --> 19:39.030
I can't believe it!
What happened to you?

19:39.150 --> 19:44.120
You look fantastic.
Welcome back.

19:44.240 --> 19:49.330
How can you look
so pure and innocent?

19:49.960 --> 19:54.790
You look lovely! Look at him.
- I'm looking. I want his tan.

19:54.920 --> 19:56.590
Get a spray tan.

19:56.710 --> 19:59.380
You'll go to a small room
and spread your arms.

19:59.510 --> 20:02.760
A beautician will spray you.

20:02.890 --> 20:05.800
Then you'll spread your butt cheeks.
- Seriously?

20:05.930 --> 20:09.230
I'll go if you go.
- I'll go if you go.

20:09.350 --> 20:12.350
How about we open the bottle?

20:12.480 --> 20:14.730
Sure.
- I've been sober for hours.

20:14.860 --> 20:17.730
It's a matter of seconds now.
- You do look pale.

20:17.860 --> 20:22.320
Hi! I have a great
apartment for you. I'll show you.

20:26.080 --> 20:28.290
Have you seen Sanna?
- No.

20:28.410 --> 20:31.750
You haven't?
- We have a date tonight.

20:32.960 --> 20:35.250
It looks fantastic.

20:36.500 --> 20:40.170
You're a 50s type of woman.

20:40.880 --> 20:44.470
Central European brand clothes
usually don't look good -

20:44.590 --> 20:47.550
on us Finns because we don't
have curves. But look at you.

20:47.680 --> 20:49.560
We'll need to take it in here.

20:49.680 --> 20:53.520
You have a waist.
Not everyone at your age does.

20:53.640 --> 20:56.110
And breasts.
You mustn't hide them.

20:56.230 --> 20:59.230
They sag a bit.
I've breastfed one child.

20:59.360 --> 21:02.700
You're not a girl anymore.
You're a woman.

21:02.820 --> 21:06.070
These. Believe me.

21:10.160 --> 21:12.500
Hi.
- She'll take these.

21:12.620 --> 21:16.380
I already bought these.
I think these go well together.

21:16.500 --> 21:18.670
Really nice.
- Very good.

21:53.950 --> 21:58.830
UNKNOWN NUMBER

22:09.010 --> 22:12.680
It's sometimes really hard
to open those bags.

22:15.480 --> 22:18.900
Sometimes licking
your fingers helps.

22:20.520 --> 22:22.320
And then the trap will open.

22:22.440 --> 22:24.530
What would you like?

22:26.110 --> 22:30.780
Those bananas look good.

22:31.950 --> 22:36.000
Should you take a couple
and slip them into the trap?

22:39.880 --> 22:46.220
Can you close the trap
with your eyes closed?

22:51.600 --> 22:55.810
No peeking.
When you're ready, say "hep."

22:58.640 --> 23:00.400
Hep.

23:12.240 --> 23:13.910
RATAKATU STREET

24:17.390 --> 24:21.390
I have to say it's heavenly
to climax with you.

24:31.860 --> 24:34.280
Jesus, Annika!

24:38.830 --> 24:42.830
I have to say it's heavenly
to climax with you.

25:23.870 --> 25:26.120
Good morning, Bunny!

25:27.920 --> 25:33.260
No, no, no, no, no, no. Fuck.

25:49.270 --> 25:51.820
How did the lunch with Ricky go?

25:54.240 --> 25:57.910
Very well, thank you.
- Great.

26:03.080 --> 26:09.920
Two, three. One, two, three.
One, two...

26:10.040 --> 26:12.130
Okay, let's calm down.

26:12.250 --> 26:16.550
Sanna, you're a bit ahead.
You have to learn the steps.

26:16.680 --> 26:20.050
I want to do this
with passion or not at all.

26:20.180 --> 26:23.680
Learning the steps
doesn't lessen the passion.

26:23.810 --> 26:27.310
You know I'm not that good
at learning the steps.

26:27.440 --> 26:30.900
You lead all the time.
- Kristian has a point.

26:31.020 --> 26:36.070
Learning the steps doesn't take away
from the passion. It enhances it.

26:36.190 --> 26:40.910
At least I'm doing something right.
He's just thinking about his steps.

26:41.030 --> 26:43.790
Could you for once do
something to make me happy?

26:43.910 --> 26:45.660
Okay, let's calm down -

26:45.790 --> 26:48.710
and come back to this moment,
to our selfhoods.

26:48.830 --> 26:51.840
Let's take a breath
with our eyes closed.

26:51.960 --> 26:54.880
Take a deep breath and exhale.

26:55.010 --> 26:58.510
Keep your tango. I'll go check
out the African dance class.

26:58.630 --> 27:01.220
Maybe I'll find my selfhood there.

27:03.850 --> 27:05.810
Ciao.
- Ciao.

27:06.350 --> 27:10.400
You have a new perfume?
- Yes. A gift from my husband.

27:10.520 --> 27:13.270
It smells good. It really does.

27:13.400 --> 27:15.610
My husband has good taste.

27:16.400 --> 27:20.160
It didn't work out?
- Definitely not.

27:20.280 --> 27:23.580
I must have told you
about 123 times -

27:23.700 --> 27:28.250
that you should tone down
the attitude a couple of notches.

27:28.370 --> 27:32.790
I can't. - You can do
anything if you want to.

27:32.920 --> 27:34.840
I guess I don't want to.

27:35.340 --> 27:37.800
Could you get me coffee, honey?

27:37.920 --> 27:42.800
I can give you a couple
of tips for selling apartments.

27:44.470 --> 27:48.640
The dance lessons
you recommended suck.

27:48.770 --> 27:51.600
Some self-important blonde
was breathing down my neck.

27:51.730 --> 27:53.940
I didn't learn anything.

27:57.860 --> 28:00.990
This is a stressful time.
For Sanna especially.

28:01.110 --> 28:04.570
Is there a problem
in this neighborhood?

28:04.700 --> 28:07.910
Or don't you young people know
how to sell apartments?

28:08.040 --> 28:09.830
Fuck the wedding.

28:09.960 --> 28:14.920
An old-fashioned institution full of
rules that no one gives a fuck about.

28:15.040 --> 28:18.340
Kristian, good luck.

28:19.090 --> 28:20.760
Thank you.

28:33.100 --> 28:34.770
Wait a moment.

28:36.980 --> 28:39.570
I had an appointment with Antti.
- Come on in.

28:39.690 --> 28:45.120
What's your favorite city?
- Paris, of course. I love it!

28:45.240 --> 28:47.160
Rome is mine.

28:56.130 --> 29:00.880
Look who's here.
- Hello, darling.

29:01.010 --> 29:03.090
Nice to see you again.

29:03.220 --> 29:06.470
Hello. How are you?
- I'm good.

29:07.470 --> 29:10.060
Ciao bella.
- Ciao. Ciao.

29:10.180 --> 29:12.480
See you. Arrivederci.

29:14.560 --> 29:16.230
It's lovely to be here.

29:16.350 --> 29:20.070
Can you give me a haircut
that'll look good in the woods?

29:21.900 --> 29:26.410
I'll give you a BMW 3 series
for the same price.

29:26.530 --> 29:29.830
A stylish car for an elegant lady.

29:29.950 --> 29:33.580
I want a plain car.
- C'mon.

29:34.250 --> 29:36.120
You have a chance to find out -

29:36.250 --> 29:39.960
what it feels like
when your ass is on fire.

29:40.090 --> 29:43.010
There's also
that cream-colored Mercedes.

29:43.130 --> 29:45.880
2.5 L engine.
Automatic. Air-conditioned.

29:46.010 --> 29:49.680
We also have a Ferrari... What?

29:49.810 --> 29:54.230
I wanted to see what your
ass looks like after being on fire.

29:56.020 --> 30:00.190
Okay, fine. So you're looking
for a plain car. - Yep.

30:00.320 --> 30:02.650
There you have them.
- I want that one.

30:02.780 --> 30:07.780
Skoda. You want a Skoda.
- Yes. I want a Skoda.

30:10.330 --> 30:13.250
What are men thinking when
they send pics to women?

30:13.370 --> 30:16.250
What pics?
- Pics of their penises.

30:16.370 --> 30:19.500
What goes on in their mind?
- That's a good question -

30:19.630 --> 30:22.960
because 80 percent of women
don't like them at all.

30:23.090 --> 30:27.550
But 20 percent like them.
Quite a bit, actually.

30:27.680 --> 30:30.760
To the 80 percent,
you have to start talking -

30:30.890 --> 30:33.600
about having children
and a future together -

30:33.720 --> 30:36.270
and the same last name
and blah blah blah.

30:36.390 --> 30:38.810
What are your statistics based on?

30:38.940 --> 30:41.900
How many times
have you sent dick pics?

30:42.020 --> 30:44.320
A couple of times.

30:44.940 --> 30:51.240
What? All men have sent a pic
of their penis at least once.

30:51.990 --> 30:54.870
Do men think women are that stupid?
- No.

30:55.000 --> 30:58.670
Or are men that stupid?
- Don't generalize.

30:58.790 --> 31:01.590
You tell an intelligent woman
she's beautiful.

31:01.710 --> 31:06.590
You tell a beautiful woman she's
intelligent. - So, you lied to me.

31:07.920 --> 31:10.470
I need to take a shit. Seriously.

31:10.590 --> 31:15.180
I told you not to eat or drink.
We can't get out of the car.

31:15.310 --> 31:17.730
You have to hold it.

31:17.850 --> 31:20.600
Now!
- What is it?

31:25.360 --> 31:27.110
Fuck.

31:29.070 --> 31:32.320
Oh hello. Hello.

31:34.830 --> 31:37.700
Go away. Go away.

31:38.870 --> 31:43.040
What the hell are you doing?
- Taking a shit. You have paper?

31:43.170 --> 31:46.920
I told you not to go anywhere.
Put your head down.

31:47.050 --> 31:49.340
I couldn't hold it.

31:49.470 --> 31:51.890
Keep low, goddammit!

31:52.840 --> 31:56.140
Don't come near me.
I can't believe this is happening.

31:58.640 --> 32:01.900
Now we gotta go.
Pull your pants up. Quick.

32:02.650 --> 32:04.730
Come. C'mon.

32:15.700 --> 32:19.620
You see anything?
- Three men just went in.

32:19.750 --> 32:23.750
If they're having some senior
sex session, I'm out of here.

32:23.880 --> 32:25.540
Wait here.

32:45.980 --> 32:48.780
To Brita's first kill of the season.

32:56.570 --> 33:01.080
Annika. What are you doing here?
- Hi, Brita.

33:03.370 --> 33:06.380
What?
- This isn't what it looks like.

33:06.880 --> 33:11.380
I know her. I'll take care of it.
- Okay. We'll go skin the kill.

33:11.510 --> 33:13.840
This is Jape.
- Brita.

33:14.510 --> 33:19.140
Let me help you.
- Our car is that way.

33:21.560 --> 33:24.140
Annika, what's going on?

33:24.270 --> 33:28.610
Why don't you get a divorce and
start a new relationship honestly?

33:28.730 --> 33:33.990
You'll have more problems
if you get caught.

33:34.110 --> 33:39.030
This is about love. For Ulf.
- That's kind of hard to believe.

33:39.700 --> 33:44.500
You've been married a long time.

33:44.620 --> 33:47.580
I thought you'd have
something greater -

33:47.710 --> 33:52.590
than a moment of passion
and this topsy-turviness.

33:52.710 --> 33:57.180
Topsy-turviness? - Yes.
You and Ulf have a wonderful life.

33:58.090 --> 34:03.810
His four children. His career
as a diplomat all over the world.

34:03.930 --> 34:05.810
The whole deal.

34:07.600 --> 34:13.440
Isn't the risk too big?
You're both powerful people.

34:13.570 --> 34:17.449
This isn't about taking a risk.

34:17.570 --> 34:20.989
What then?
- How should I put it.

34:21.120 --> 34:25.000
It's about life itself.
What we have left.

34:26.040 --> 34:31.960
Don't memories mean
anything to you? - Of course.

34:33.420 --> 34:36.340
I want to know why you're
cheating on your husband.

34:36.469 --> 34:41.050
If Ulf finds out he was right,
he'll have a heart attack.

34:41.179 --> 34:43.310
That's the last thing we want.

34:43.429 --> 34:48.020
Are you going to take long?
I'm freezing. - I'll go now.

34:49.900 --> 34:55.110
Bye bye. Drive carefully.
- Bye.

34:59.740 --> 35:04.450
When will you be home?

35:09.000 --> 35:11.630
Your son just wants to know.

35:12.460 --> 35:19.720
I don't know. I can't...

35:27.480 --> 35:29.270
Good evening.

35:29.730 --> 35:31.810
Please blow.

35:35.650 --> 35:39.030
Zero. Your registration, please.
- Here.

35:39.150 --> 35:42.620
Is this a rental car?
- As always. You know that.

35:42.740 --> 35:44.830
Good. Thank you.

35:46.120 --> 35:48.040
Then one kiss.

35:50.420 --> 35:54.750
Toni, can you take a look at
the trunk? It won't close properly.

36:00.840 --> 36:04.100
I've missed you.
- I can't say the same.

36:05.720 --> 36:10.060
Why did you have to leave?
Are you making money doing this?

36:10.190 --> 36:12.400
I wouldn't say that.

36:15.320 --> 36:17.780
Why can't you come back?

36:17.900 --> 36:20.070
I may be
a shitty private detective, -

36:20.200 --> 36:22.780
but I was an even shittier cop.

36:25.410 --> 36:30.290
That's too bad.
You never even let me love you.

36:31.080 --> 36:35.340
Toni, c'mon. I've had to deal
with all kinds of stuff lately.

36:36.170 --> 36:40.510
Yeah. I remember.
You're faithful to your husband.

36:40.630 --> 36:45.680
I respect you for having morals.

36:46.260 --> 36:50.310
Like I said, I've had to deal
with all kinds of stuff lately.

36:51.140 --> 36:54.350
First of all, the Finnish police
betrayed me.

36:54.480 --> 36:56.770
All that chaos
in the management, -

36:56.900 --> 36:59.690
and then my husband
betrayed me.

36:59.820 --> 37:02.650
I thought we'd be there
for each other, -

37:02.780 --> 37:06.660
but he just disappeared
into his own world. Poof!

37:06.780 --> 37:11.540
He stopped caring
about me and said -

37:11.660 --> 37:14.290
it's part of marriage
and part of life.

37:14.420 --> 37:17.250
But you know what? It's not.

37:17.710 --> 37:19.920
It's all a lie.

37:21.550 --> 37:26.010
I can't live a lie.
That's why I always have to leave.

37:28.010 --> 37:30.810
Your coat is stuck in the door.

37:33.640 --> 37:38.480
Annika, take it easy, will you?
- Yeah.

37:38.610 --> 37:40.480
Okay?
- Yeah.

38:16.940 --> 38:19.940
Hi, Bunny.
Are you free this afternoon?

38:20.060 --> 38:22.980
You want to see my family's villa?

38:24.280 --> 38:26.650
Fucking jerk-offs...

38:28.570 --> 38:33.580
Why can't I sell this apartment
even after lowering the price?

38:33.700 --> 38:38.210
Still not? Why don't you use
your badge every once in a while.

38:38.330 --> 38:41.750
It might increase your authority.

38:41.880 --> 38:45.210
You'll have more street cred.

38:47.260 --> 38:51.390
Kristian isn't wearing one.
- I don't have a photo yet.

38:52.060 --> 38:57.020
This isn't my photo.
Does this woman work here?

39:00.810 --> 39:02.650
Does she?

39:05.900 --> 39:10.370
When was the last time you looked
in the mirror, you damn rabbit?

39:11.160 --> 39:14.040
I'd like to see you put
as much energy into work -

39:14.160 --> 39:16.540
as you put into fucking around.

39:35.180 --> 39:36.930
Hello?

39:43.770 --> 39:45.480
Yoo-hoo?

39:54.080 --> 39:56.830
Hello?
- You want a glass of wine?

40:00.920 --> 40:05.290
Your family's villa, right?
- Yes. My family's villa.

40:28.570 --> 40:30.900
Where was that taken?

40:31.030 --> 40:33.700
Cyprus?
- Madeira.

40:34.910 --> 40:37.950
Your clad as a UN peacekeeper.
- Oh, that's right.

40:38.080 --> 40:40.370
In Madeira?
- Yes.

40:40.500 --> 40:44.250
In the early days of UN Peacekeeping.

40:44.380 --> 40:47.590
There was a small crisis that
not many people know of.

40:47.710 --> 40:52.260
Those were the early clays
of Finnish Peacekeeping.

40:52.800 --> 40:54.890
Your mom and clad?

40:56.800 --> 41:01.600
Little Ricky was a mere twinkle
in his mom's and dad's eyes.

41:05.060 --> 41:06.770
Art.

41:07.570 --> 41:09.730
I love art.

41:14.070 --> 41:19.410
Whose are these?
- My dad's, mine and my cousins'.

41:19.540 --> 41:24.170
All trophies won by the Kalin
family. We're a family of winners.

41:25.170 --> 41:29.340
"Best Lady 2000"?
- Oh, it was that long ago.

41:34.010 --> 41:37.470
How many children
did you say you have?

41:47.400 --> 41:53.110
Have you ever wondered
if water drops below 10 degrees...

41:55.110 --> 41:57.320
Can you swim in it?

41:58.160 --> 42:00.700
Can you fuck in it?

42:09.380 --> 42:11.170
Quick!

42:17.010 --> 42:19.640
All I want is clear rules.

42:19.760 --> 42:23.560
I want us to be on the same page.
- And you want sex.

42:23.680 --> 42:25.850
Yes, I want sex.

42:28.770 --> 42:31.820
You don't have to
play games with me.

42:34.860 --> 42:37.610
I just want you to be
honest with me.

42:39.910 --> 42:43.040
Isn't this being honest?

43:12.270 --> 43:14.940
Annika,
I have to turn the lights on.

43:26.370 --> 43:28.250
Sex.

43:28.370 --> 43:34.710
Sex is a force.
- Yep. A destructive force.

43:35.710 --> 43:38.630
Where's our rental contract?
I need it to prove -

43:38.760 --> 43:42.510
that the condominium is liable
for the renovation.

43:42.640 --> 43:45.100
I'll look for it today.

43:49.390 --> 43:51.730
Shouldn't you go home?

43:52.440 --> 43:55.570
People sleep at home, not at work.

44:08.250 --> 44:10.460
Well?
- My Patrik.

44:11.250 --> 44:13.630
Look, he got a haircut.

44:14.500 --> 44:17.420
Wow. It looks really good.

44:34.400 --> 44:40.440
I can't take money under the table.
- It's a birthday present.

44:43.070 --> 44:46.030
Ulf, believe me.
Brita is not cheating on you.

44:46.160 --> 44:48.240
She's just friends with those men.

44:49.160 --> 44:54.330
You've always been like me.
Honest.

45:02.550 --> 45:06.350
I've done what I promised
in my election campaign.

45:07.760 --> 45:13.140
I've spent my whole life working
to pay off our luxury apartment.

45:14.400 --> 45:19.360
I've only had three affairs
in my life. On Corfu.

45:22.320 --> 45:26.530
And a fourth one on Kos, but
there were no feelings involved.

45:26.660 --> 45:29.370
It was for one purpose only.

45:32.660 --> 45:34.460
Annika.

45:37.290 --> 45:40.210
Brita doesn't look at me anymore.

45:42.260 --> 45:45.220
That's how I know
something's going on.

45:46.720 --> 45:49.680
She doesn't touch me
anymore, either.

45:54.810 --> 45:56.850
Here you are.

46:03.400 --> 46:06.910
Ulf, can I answer? Patrik's calling.

46:07.030 --> 46:12.040
Of course. Send him my love.

46:14.250 --> 46:16.120
Hi, sweetie.

46:16.250 --> 46:18.580
I'm having lunch
with your great uncle.

46:18.710 --> 46:20.500
He sends you his love.

46:20.630 --> 46:23.670

46:23.800 --> 46:25.930

my husband is having an affair.

How much for your services?

46:44.240 --> 46:46.530

REAL ESTATE AGENT CALLING

47:11.350 --> 47:13.970
Hi.
- What are you doing?

47:14.720 --> 47:17.480
I'm working.
- Under the table?

47:18.270 --> 47:21.560
Yeah. This is better for my back.

47:21.980 --> 47:24.820
Hop in.
- Why?

47:24.940 --> 47:28.280
I'm going to
the Åland Islands on business.

47:28.400 --> 47:31.780
Jesus. That doesn't fit
my lifestyle at all.

47:32.580 --> 47:34.660
I want you, Bunny.

47:38.830 --> 47:41.630
I'll be back in 15 minutes.

47:42.920 --> 47:44.710
Kaisa?

47:51.590 --> 47:53.350
Ouch! Fuck!

47:56.270 --> 48:02.100
Yeah. Just a moment.
I could call you later. Yeah.

48:03.150 --> 48:06.780
Yeah. I'll call you back in a bit.

48:06.900 --> 48:09.240
Okay. Good. Kisses. Bye.

48:16.790 --> 48:19.460
Are you all right?
- Yes, I am.

48:33.090 --> 48:36.600
Hey, we're in the bus lane.
- You wanna drive?

49:54.300 --> 49:58.050
Hi, Josefine.
- Hi, Ricky!

49:58.180 --> 50:00.970
Long time no see.
- Yeah. How are you?

50:01.100 --> 50:05.600
Really good. You?
- Really good. So nice to see you.

50:05.730 --> 50:08.520
I put you in your usual room.
- Really?

50:08.650 --> 50:13.900
Yeah. - Thanks so much.
Hi, Terese, how are you?

50:14.030 --> 50:16.450
Good, thanks. You?
- Really good.

50:16.570 --> 50:20.450
Nice to have you here.
- Thanks. See you.

50:31.550 --> 50:33.380
What's this?

50:33.920 --> 50:36.970
Looks like it reads
"Mr. and Mrs. Kalin."

50:58.450 --> 51:00.530
Could you go to the liquor store?

51:00.660 --> 51:05.500
Bring a bottle of white wine
and a bottle of red.

51:35.730 --> 51:39.280
Hi! Nice to see you.
- Nice to see you.

51:39.400 --> 51:44.540
How are you? Are we going
to look at the apartment? - Sure.

52:14.820 --> 52:16.730
Guess who?

52:17.320 --> 52:20.650
Boogeyman.
- Correct.

52:21.780 --> 52:24.780
I got the deal.
- You did?

52:24.910 --> 52:28.040
Congratulations.
- Thanks.

52:28.830 --> 52:32.370
If I don't get food soon,
I'm gonna eat you.

52:37.090 --> 52:39.340
You have something in your hair.

52:43.800 --> 52:45.550
This.

52:45.680 --> 52:49.430
How did it end up there?
- Exactly.

52:50.140 --> 52:55.270
How do press-on nails
usually end up in people's hair?

55:29.840 --> 55:33.310
Where did that come from?
- This bump?

55:34.260 --> 55:37.560
Iran into a wall.
I left in such a hurry.

55:37.680 --> 55:40.980
How did you know where
my office is, by the way?

55:41.100 --> 55:43.770
I've seen you there many times.

55:50.910 --> 55:54.160
What do you do?
- Besides you?

55:54.280 --> 55:56.660
What do you do for a living?

55:58.040 --> 56:02.380
All kinds of things.
- All kinds of things?

56:04.710 --> 56:06.510
Things.
- What kind of things?

56:06.630 --> 56:10.930
Different kinds of things. - Could
you show me one of those things?

56:11.050 --> 56:15.890
You want me to do things to you?
- Yeah, show me something wild.

56:16.010 --> 56:20.600
That's what you want?
- Yes, something wild and naughty.

56:20.730 --> 56:25.110
And you can take your time.
- Oh yeah?

57:10.320 --> 57:12.150
Don't.

57:27.210 --> 57:29.380
Hi.
- Hi, it's Mom.

57:30.170 --> 57:32.380
How was your day?

57:34.590 --> 57:36.430
Hi, it's Dad.

57:37.390 --> 57:39.640
What are you up to?

57:40.390 --> 57:42.350
Oh.

57:44.350 --> 57:50.780
Nothing. I'm at a showing,
and a rail just came off.

58:48.880 --> 58:50.540
Hi.

58:51.840 --> 58:55.760
Yeah. Yes, I remember, of course.

58:57.720 --> 59:03.810
Yes. Like we talked,
it would be nice to get together.

59:05.560 --> 59:09.900
Yes, we could... We could...

59:10.770 --> 59:14.440
...close the deal. Close the deal.

59:15.320 --> 59:19.490
I'm not in the city.
I'm on the Åland Islands.

59:20.120 --> 59:25.370
I'll call you when we...
when I get back.

59:25.830 --> 59:28.620
Great. Talk to you later.

01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:05.660
Hooray. Hooray. Hooray.

01:00:07.580 --> 01:00:11.040
Can I borrow your laptop?
I'm out of battery.

01:00:11.170 --> 01:00:13.750
I should check
a couple of work e-mails.

01:00:16.130 --> 01:00:18.840
Yeah, sure.

01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:33.610
You eat when you use this?

01:00:35.020 --> 01:00:39.070
Does it look like I do?
- Yes, and it feels like it.

01:00:39.190 --> 01:00:42.450
I'll go get a coffee. You want one?

01:00:43.240 --> 01:00:46.950
www.acedating.fi

01:01:01.760 --> 01:01:06.350
When I look into your brown eyes

01:01:06.470 --> 01:01:08.180
Hazel eyes.

01:01:08.310 --> 01:01:11.520
You're the one I...

01:01:12.890 --> 01:01:20.150
When I look into your hazel eyes

01:01:26.620 --> 01:01:32.210
Well... Err.. I have to...

01:01:33.290 --> 01:01:36.330
Honey Bunny,
I have to drop you off here.

01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:39.050
I have to turn back.

01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:43.930
I'm sure you can take
the tram or something.

01:02:25.010 --> 01:02:27.140
Our children moved out.

01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:30.600
This is a bit too big
for my husband and me.

01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:34.270
We'd like as much
money as possible -

01:02:34.390 --> 01:02:36.770
and to sell this
as soon as possible -

01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:38.980
so that we can move
into a smaller apartment.

01:02:39.110 --> 01:02:43.610
When did you start
making babies? At 16?

01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:48.200
Oh no, not that young.
I was 25 when I had my first child.

01:02:48.320 --> 01:02:53.330
I turned 50 last month.
- I don't believe you.

01:02:55.080 --> 01:02:58.420
You can fit a longer table here, -

01:02:58.540 --> 01:03:02.000
if you want to throw
a party or something.

01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:06.170
The balcony is over there.

01:03:06.300 --> 01:03:09.300
This is the reason we bought this.

01:03:43.090 --> 01:03:46.260
That's the master bedroom.

01:04:36.890 --> 01:04:39.140
I'm married.

01:04:40.940 --> 01:04:43.270
And I plan to stay married.

01:04:45.230 --> 01:04:48.110
I've had my adventures. Sorry.

01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:51.110
You're absolutely sure?

01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:58.200
But you can sell this apartment.
- Then I'll get to see you again.

01:05:28.520 --> 01:05:34.160
So you think my ex only wants to get
me into bed if he wants to see me?

01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:39.240
He only wants to have
a cup of coffee with me.

01:05:39.370 --> 01:05:41.540
Choose: coffee or marriage.

01:05:41.660 --> 01:05:44.830
When does your rule take effect?
After we're married?

01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:47.880
I don't even understand
your question.

01:05:49.550 --> 01:05:52.260
One, two, three, four.

01:05:53.260 --> 01:05:57.430
It's starting to look good.
You've made progress.

01:06:01.980 --> 01:06:04.690
He sang to me that he loves me.

01:06:04.810 --> 01:06:07.940
Love is such a dead thing.
- True.

01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:10.820
But we're just having sex.

01:06:10.940 --> 01:06:13.320
How many times have you had sex?

01:06:13.440 --> 01:06:18.700
You can borrow them, but I want
them back in good condition.

01:06:19.530 --> 01:06:23.450
Did you have them washed?
- That's what I was going to do.

01:06:23.580 --> 01:06:27.630
Let's hear it. How many times?
- What?

01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:31.000
When you bumped
into each other on the street.

01:06:31.130 --> 01:06:34.220
Then in the store.
At the apartment afterwards.

01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:37.720
At the villa.
The trip to the Åland Islands.

01:06:38.470 --> 01:06:41.760
What happened there?
- That counts as once.

01:06:41.890 --> 01:06:46.690
What about the first time you met?
The time Ricky didn't remember.

01:06:46.810 --> 01:06:50.440
Then the sixth time.
- No fucking way.

01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:54.070
Does a blow job count?

01:06:55.740 --> 01:07:00.160
Aren't we talking about Annika's
famous sixth time rule here?

01:07:02.240 --> 01:07:04.830
Annika, you're in love.

01:07:04.950 --> 01:07:08.750
It's a stupid rule.
I don't believe in it anymore.

01:07:08.880 --> 01:07:10.540
Here are my shoes.

01:07:10.670 --> 01:07:14.630
I forgot to take them on the trip.
- Where did this couch come from?

01:07:14.760 --> 01:07:16.590
I didn't notice it had arrived.

01:07:16.720 --> 01:07:20.850
I bought it when I wanted
to celebrate starting my company.

01:07:20.970 --> 01:07:24.020
It was supposed to be brown,
but that's pink.

01:07:26.230 --> 01:07:29.060
Your client's here. I'll go home.

01:07:29.810 --> 01:07:33.360
Are you going to tell her
you're sleeping with her husband?

01:07:38.030 --> 01:07:41.410
Would you like coffee or tea?

01:07:43.530 --> 01:07:48.830
I was here two weeks ago.
What's this?

01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:51.630
You have two receipts
for dinners paid in cash.

01:07:51.750 --> 01:07:56.380
These could be anybody's.
I'm blonde, but I'm not stupid.

01:07:56.510 --> 01:07:58.470
Did you find something out?

01:07:58.590 --> 01:08:01.640
You're the one who was supposed
to find something out.

01:08:02.850 --> 01:08:04.930
Did it ever cross your mind -

01:08:05.060 --> 01:08:08.310
that he might not be
cheating on you? - No.

01:08:09.390 --> 01:08:13.770
To be honest with you, no.
I went to his office.

01:08:15.110 --> 01:08:18.740
He's sleeping with at least
one of his colleagues, if not all.

01:08:18.859 --> 01:08:22.319
He lies so well
that he believes his own lies.

01:08:22.450 --> 01:08:24.200
He'll fuck anyone.

01:08:24.330 --> 01:08:29.330
Any size, age and any kind of looks.
Anything goes.

01:08:29.790 --> 01:08:31.790
Fuck. Fuck.

01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:42.680
How did you describe him?

01:08:48.180 --> 01:08:52.850
"Insatiable sex addict.
Pathological liar."

01:08:53.729 --> 01:08:57.479
You're right.
Ricky is cheating on you.

01:08:57.609 --> 01:09:01.950
He went to the Åland Islands with
a woman. That's from their room.

01:09:05.200 --> 01:09:08.540
I have my methods. Don't ask me.

01:09:16.290 --> 01:09:17.960
I don't understand.

01:09:22.800 --> 01:09:24.470
Look at me.

01:09:26.550 --> 01:09:28.640
What do you see?

01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:31.640
A damn beautiful woman
who's very sweet.

01:09:31.770 --> 01:09:34.939
I take care of his children
from his previous marriage.

01:09:35.060 --> 01:09:38.609
I rub his feet
when he's worried about work.

01:09:38.729 --> 01:09:41.279
I'll do anything.

01:09:42.649 --> 01:09:44.859
Why isn't that enough?

01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:51.250
I'll pay your invoice today.

01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:10.100
I fuck anything that moves
and don't use protection.

01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:14.980
Case Number 1: Ricky Kalin.

01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:17.980
Client: Lotta Vähätupa, wife.

01:10:18.110 --> 01:10:21.570
Assignment accepted two weeks ago.
Got permission to seduce Ricky -

01:10:21.690 --> 01:10:25.280
as long as I would keep
my panties on.

01:10:33.450 --> 01:10:37.960
Ricky Kalin, how are you
going to pull through all this?

01:11:07.860 --> 01:11:11.330
Fuck me harder! Harder!
- What?

01:11:11.950 --> 01:11:13.790
Q.“
mm

01:11:56.410 --> 01:11:58.290
Hi.
- Hi.

01:12:00.250 --> 01:12:02.170
How did it go?

01:12:03.710 --> 01:12:06.340
The apartment's mine to sell.

01:12:07.920 --> 01:12:09.840
That's my boy.

01:12:15.180 --> 01:12:17.430
Are you alone?

01:12:58.970 --> 01:13:02.560

01:13:33.970 --> 01:13:36.100
Hi, Anette.

01:13:37.390 --> 01:13:40.470
Were we? Oh no.

01:13:43.230 --> 01:13:47.440
Hi. Ricky must be here, right?
- Yes, he just got here.

01:13:50.110 --> 01:13:55.950
Well... Anette, why don't we...

01:13:58.740 --> 01:14:00.910
What?

01:14:02.120 --> 01:14:04.210
I don't quite understand.

01:14:06.130 --> 01:14:08.630
What do you mean, pregnant?

01:14:11.710 --> 01:14:13.760
Pregnant by...

01:14:18.140 --> 01:14:23.060
Thanks for calling.
I'll get back to you.

01:14:25.600 --> 01:14:28.770
You want me to tell all your
colleagues what a creep you are?

01:14:28.900 --> 01:14:32.150
Where were you
and the kids last night?

01:14:34.990 --> 01:14:38.820
How low can a woman go?

01:14:38.950 --> 01:14:43.080
I hired a private detective to keep
an eye on you. - You hired what?

01:14:43.200 --> 01:14:46.210
She told me
what I already knew myself.

01:14:49.710 --> 01:14:52.550
A business trip
to the Åland Islands?

01:14:57.090 --> 01:14:59.470
So? How many are there?

01:15:01.350 --> 01:15:03.680
What do you mean, how many?

01:15:04.430 --> 01:15:07.190
Those fucking whores!

01:15:10.610 --> 01:15:14.490
There are none, Lotta.
Of course there aren't any.

01:15:14.610 --> 01:15:16.990
Why are you lying to me?
- I'm not.

01:15:17.110 --> 01:15:21.240
Why are you lying to me?
- There are no other women.

01:15:24.540 --> 01:15:29.500
Why are you lying to me?
- With you, I have no choice.

01:15:43.220 --> 01:15:49.400
Will you pick up the kids?
- Of course. Of course I will.

01:16:04.330 --> 01:16:08.870
Fuck! Fuck. Fuck.

01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:12.000
Fuck. Shit. Shit.

01:16:12.840 --> 01:16:17.300
The balcony is very spacious
as you probably noticed.

01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:19.590
Go ahead, take a look.

01:16:19.720 --> 01:16:24.050
This is a good condominium.
They've done the major renovations.

01:16:24.890 --> 01:16:27.640
There won't be any surprises...

01:16:30.060 --> 01:16:31.730
Hi.

01:16:33.400 --> 01:16:38.400
Here you are.
The info sheet on the apartment.

01:16:49.330 --> 01:16:51.960
This will sell fast.

01:16:53.380 --> 01:16:56.840
Do I have to teach you
how to cheat?

01:17:00.840 --> 01:17:05.640
You can't send a photo of your penis
to ten women at the same time.

01:17:09.850 --> 01:17:11.640
You want me to list
the women for you?

01:17:11.770 --> 01:17:16.860
If I found out about them this
easily, they can find out about me.

01:17:22.240 --> 01:17:24.990
You fuck anything that moves?

01:17:32.710 --> 01:17:35.630
I don't care
if you're a mediocre lover, -

01:17:35.750 --> 01:17:39.340
but I can't stand it
if you're so fucking stupid.

01:17:45.340 --> 01:17:47.640
The layout is really good.

01:17:52.600 --> 01:17:54.810
The parquet floor is refinished.

01:17:56.610 --> 01:18:01.070
PATHOLOGICAL LIAR
INSATIABLE SEX ADDICT

01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:14.180
Subject: Ricky Kalin

01:19:14.310 --> 01:19:17.230
Wife suspects he's cheating.

01:19:34.790 --> 01:19:39.170
Fact Number 1:
He fucks whenever needed.

01:19:39.290 --> 01:19:42.420
He has two calendars:
one for work, one for sex.

01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:44.630
There's always someone available.

01:19:44.760 --> 01:19:47.970
He never uses first names because
he's afraid of mixing women up.

01:19:48.090 --> 01:19:52.510
Fact Number 2: His wedding ring
is on and off.

01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:56.140
Fact Number 3: Always carries
a clean shirt in his briefcase -

01:19:56.270 --> 01:19:58.690
in case of a lipstick stain.

01:19:58.810 --> 01:20:02.560
Uses Björn Borg underwear, which
is proof he has no imagination.

01:20:02.690 --> 01:20:06.400
Sings beautifully,
which is Fact Number 4.

01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:13.120
Says that sex with me
is the best in the world, -

01:20:13.240 --> 01:20:15.830
which is Fact Number 5.

01:20:16.830 --> 01:20:19.120
Fact Number 6.

01:20:19.790 --> 01:20:25.210
Six times. The sixth time I got
hooked on his touch and him.

01:20:31.260 --> 01:20:34.600
I thought I'd forget you
in a couple of days.

01:20:34.720 --> 01:20:37.470
But it didn't go exactly like that.

01:20:47.230 --> 01:20:49.030
You're special.

01:20:50.280 --> 01:20:53.780
You're like me, but
at the same time you're not.

01:20:53.910 --> 01:20:58.370
What's too much?
What's too little? What's enough?

01:21:02.750 --> 01:21:05.250
I'll never be enough for you.

01:21:14.340 --> 01:21:17.470
Hi.

01:21:20.850 --> 01:21:24.400
Was this for me?

01:21:25.690 --> 01:21:32.740
Yes, for you.
I just wanted to say hi.

01:21:38.120 --> 01:21:40.080
Good photo.

01:21:42.330 --> 01:21:45.460
That's Lotta, my wife.

01:21:46.040 --> 01:21:48.300
Now my ex-wife, thanks to you.

01:21:48.420 --> 01:21:50.880
We have one child together.

01:21:52.090 --> 01:21:56.140
Merite is the mother
of my two eldest children.

01:21:56.760 --> 01:21:59.810
Lotta and my father own
a dance studio together.

01:21:59.930 --> 01:22:04.140
My colleague Sanna
takes dance lessons there -

01:22:04.270 --> 01:22:08.770
with Kristian, her future husband,
who's also my colleague.

01:22:11.150 --> 01:22:14.240
Virpi, Anna, -

01:22:16.490 --> 01:22:18.580
Heidi, Laura, -

01:22:19.620 --> 01:22:22.910
Minna and Sari belong
to the inner circle.

01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:26.420
In addition to that, -

01:22:28.210 --> 01:22:32.510
I have women in the Helsinki region
that I meet with regularly.

01:22:32.630 --> 01:22:37.840
I also have satellites
outside the Helsinki region, -

01:22:40.180 --> 01:22:43.930
around Finland,
in the Nordic countries, -

01:22:45.440 --> 01:22:47.560
in the Baltic countries, -

01:22:48.900 --> 01:22:52.440
in Germany, Belgium, etc.

01:22:52.570 --> 01:22:56.490
Ugly, beautiful.

01:22:57.530 --> 01:23:01.910
Happy, sad.

01:23:05.460 --> 01:23:07.210
Wounded.

01:23:07.330 --> 01:23:10.920
Used and unused opportunities.

01:23:17.680 --> 01:23:19.800
Questions?

01:23:22.560 --> 01:23:24.930
Where am I in that picture?

01:23:26.140 --> 01:23:28.770
That's the funny thing.

01:23:31.940 --> 01:23:34.780
You're not in that picture.

01:23:41.870 --> 01:23:43.700
You know what?

01:23:44.240 --> 01:23:46.460
No. Tell me.

01:23:46.910 --> 01:23:50.960
I love you.
- You don't.

01:23:53.130 --> 01:23:56.510
I love you.
- You don't.

01:23:57.470 --> 01:24:01.550
What do you think?
Could I love you?

01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:11.100
No.

01:24:15.480 --> 01:24:18.450
M.
- Hi.

01:24:22.240 --> 01:24:25.370
Is it okay for you
if I drop by at home?

01:24:26.120 --> 01:24:29.210
We're getting ready to go to bed...

01:24:30.370 --> 01:24:33.090
Well, this is still your home...

01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:38.300
I'd be there when Patrik wakes up.

01:25:48.950 --> 01:25:54.290
Breathe calmly.
Remember to breathe.

01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:44.760
Well, Bunny,
want to drive to your place?

01:26:46.300 --> 01:26:51.600
Yeah, let's drive into my living room
and see what we can destroy.

01:26:54.060 --> 01:26:59.690
Aren't we alike?
- We're totally unalike.

01:27:03.190 --> 01:27:07.780
Bunny“.
- Don't ever call me Bunny again.

01:27:07.910 --> 01:27:10.450
I'm not one of your rabbits.

01:27:10.580 --> 01:27:14.870
And I have other commitments.
- A husband? Children?

01:27:17.580 --> 01:27:19.290
A Child.

01:27:22.460 --> 01:27:25.300
And a husband.
- Okay.

01:27:32.470 --> 01:27:35.600
Isn't it strange
that I tell you this now?

01:27:35.730 --> 01:27:40.610
I don't think so. You have
your life, and I have mine.

01:27:40.730 --> 01:27:43.320
What we have in common is us here.

01:27:47.530 --> 01:27:49.320
Say my name.

01:27:51.530 --> 01:27:55.500
I wanna make sure
you know who you're fucking.

01:27:59.080 --> 01:28:01.250
Oh fuck. Stop.

01:28:11.140 --> 01:28:13.010
Annika.

01:28:15.930 --> 01:28:18.520
Say something beautiful to me.

01:28:27.860 --> 01:28:29.650
Are you angry at me?

01:28:30.410 --> 01:28:32.490
Why would I be angry at you?

01:28:32.620 --> 01:28:35.080
You're so quiet.
- This is what I'm like.

01:28:35.200 --> 01:28:37.500
Quiet and boring.

01:28:38.960 --> 01:28:41.040
But I'm being myself.

01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:47.090
And honest.
- Your morals are interesting.

01:28:47.210 --> 01:28:48.880
You're married.

01:28:49.010 --> 01:28:53.550
You're sleeping with me,
yet you think you're honest.

01:28:56.470 --> 01:28:59.770
Yeah. I'm honest.

01:29:01.350 --> 01:29:05.940
I haven't done anything wrong.
My husband hurt me.

01:29:07.690 --> 01:29:10.610
The way I see it,
all contracts were terminated.

01:29:10.740 --> 01:29:12.570
Even the unspoken ones.

01:29:12.700 --> 01:29:16.450
May I ask how you were hurt?

01:29:17.660 --> 01:29:22.210
I was forgotten.
- You were forgotten?

01:29:22.330 --> 01:29:27.880
The way I see it, if there's no
passion, there's no relationship.

01:29:28.960 --> 01:29:31.170
I don't want that kind of life.

01:29:33.550 --> 01:29:36.760
I don't think there's anything
more valuable than family.

01:29:36.890 --> 01:29:40.350
I wouldn't give up
my family for anything.

01:29:40.480 --> 01:29:46.520
Children, relatives, traditions.
My family is the core, my security.

01:29:46.650 --> 01:29:49.900
There's nothing without family.
- You're telling this to me?

01:29:50.030 --> 01:29:53.570
You broke my family.
- Me?

01:29:53.700 --> 01:29:56.620
Mrs. Honesty and Passion.

01:29:58.700 --> 01:30:01.620
I won't fuck you. Ever again.

01:30:32.780 --> 01:30:35.320
Hi.
- Hi.

01:30:35.450 --> 01:30:40.160
Did you have lunch?
- No.

01:30:40.290 --> 01:30:43.080
Good, because I booked us a table.

01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:46.920
I thought we could eat and talk
and take our time.

01:30:47.040 --> 01:30:50.380
I can't make it now.
- Okay.

01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:56.130
What do you mean you can't make it?
- I'm seeing a client soon.

01:30:56.260 --> 01:30:58.720
Ricky, you're lying to me.

01:31:08.980 --> 01:31:11.070
Big Bad...
- ...Wolf.

01:31:17.320 --> 01:31:22.580
Did you have a lot of people?
- About ten. Two potential buyers.

01:31:23.290 --> 01:31:26.870
You'll sell this in a couple
of weeks. - In a week.

01:31:28.370 --> 01:31:30.380
Will you help me?

01:31:33.050 --> 01:31:36.220
Is everything okay?
- Yes.

01:31:37.550 --> 01:31:40.090
I just have to meet a client
and pick up the kids.

01:31:45.770 --> 01:31:48.190
Sanna, Annika. Annika, Sanna.

01:31:51.230 --> 01:31:54.860
Why don't you continue tomorrow.

01:31:54.980 --> 01:31:57.900
Same place, same time, same lust.

01:31:58.820 --> 01:32:01.700
You're used to repetition,
aren't you?

01:32:01.820 --> 01:32:06.080
Annika, we were in the middle
of going over some work stuff.

01:32:06.200 --> 01:32:10.460
Work stuff? - A real estate
agent's normal work day.

01:32:10.580 --> 01:32:13.170
A real estate agent's
normal work day my ass.

01:32:13.290 --> 01:32:15.630
I've no idea
what you're talking about, -

01:32:15.760 --> 01:32:18.590
so why don't you stay
and talk some more.

01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:23.100
Ricky, make sure the place
is tidy and lock the doors.

01:32:27.850 --> 01:32:33.230
Are you trying to corner me?
Is that it? Or what's going on?

01:32:37.190 --> 01:32:40.070
No. Little Annika just came here -

01:32:40.200 --> 01:32:42.620
hoping that what she saw
wasn't true.

01:32:42.740 --> 01:32:44.620
You know what's funny?

01:32:44.740 --> 01:32:48.620
Even yesterday I thought you and I
could have a romantic dinner.

01:32:48.750 --> 01:32:51.540
Really? You're a smart woman.

01:32:51.670 --> 01:32:55.210
You know there's nothing wrong
with being romantic.

01:32:55.800 --> 01:33:00.550
What's the point in being together
if it's like this? - We're not.

01:33:00.680 --> 01:33:02.640
No?
- No.

01:33:03.930 --> 01:33:06.310
Oh. What are we then?

01:33:07.930 --> 01:33:11.480
I think we've been
together all these weeks.

01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:14.310
In bed, yes.
- Nights too.

01:33:14.440 --> 01:33:16.940
But we're not together.
- No.

01:33:18.150 --> 01:33:21.240
Annika, I haven't
promised you anything.

01:33:33.580 --> 01:33:35.670
You love me.

01:33:38.550 --> 01:33:41.010
Tell me that you love me.

01:33:41.130 --> 01:33:44.260
I want to hear you say you love me.

01:33:47.890 --> 01:33:50.020
I love you.

01:33:50.810 --> 01:33:54.310
What? I didn't hear anything.

01:33:55.730 --> 01:33:57.940
Say it louder.

01:33:59.730 --> 01:34:01.990
I love you.

01:34:11.250 --> 01:34:13.330
Okay.

01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:17.000
You know what?

01:34:17.130 --> 01:34:20.920
Are you going to let me go?
Just like that?

01:34:21.050 --> 01:34:24.680
Are you?
- I am.

01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:27.010
Okay.

01:34:27.140 --> 01:34:30.220
Can't we just fuck
like we have up till now?

01:34:30.350 --> 01:34:32.930
It's a hell of a lot easier.

01:34:35.440 --> 01:34:37.440
Okay.

01:34:38.150 --> 01:34:40.860
I'll go then. Okay.

01:34:40.980 --> 01:34:46.200
If that's what makes you happy.
- Yes.

01:34:46.320 --> 01:34:48.830
You leaving makes me happy.

01:35:03.760 --> 01:35:06.970
Where are you going?
- I'll go get something to eat.

01:35:07.090 --> 01:35:11.640
What are you going to get?
- Chinese. Or was it Japanese?

01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:16.520
Bring me teriyaki salmon
or chicken. And a miso soup.

01:35:16.640 --> 01:35:19.690
I love you. Thanks!
- See you.

01:35:20.650 --> 01:35:22.320
Hey, Luigi.

01:35:23.690 --> 01:35:26.450
I was waiting for you
at the spray tanning salon.

01:35:26.570 --> 01:35:30.070
What are you talking about?
- Spray tan. I guess you forgot.

01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:34.450
It would've been so cool to do it.
Let's do it some other clay.

01:35:35.660 --> 01:35:40.000
You're a grown man. Can't you
go get a spray tan by yourself?

01:35:42.340 --> 01:35:47.550
I can, and now I want to.
Not with an asshole like you.

01:35:57.980 --> 01:36:03.780

01:36:07.820 --> 01:36:11.950
Hi, Risto-Matti.
- Dad, please call me Ricky.

01:36:12.660 --> 01:36:15.660
Hi, Ricky.
- Is something wrong?

01:36:15.790 --> 01:36:20.540
I think I left the lights on
in the dance studio.

01:36:20.670 --> 01:36:25.300
And forgot to turn
the burglar alarm on.

01:36:25.880 --> 01:36:28.510
I'll go check it.

01:39:17.890 --> 01:39:19.600
Brita?

01:39:25.430 --> 01:39:27.940
Breathe. Breathe calmly.

01:39:30.110 --> 01:39:32.400
Remember to breathe.

01:39:49.210 --> 01:39:50.960
Cheers.

01:39:54.840 --> 01:39:56.800
This is good.

01:39:59.220 --> 01:40:02.640
You know
what "honesty" is in Estonian?

01:40:04.100 --> 01:40:05.930
"Ausus."

01:40:06.060 --> 01:40:08.190
Ausus.
- Yeah.

01:40:09.690 --> 01:40:13.650
You know what "faithfulness"
is in Estonian?

01:40:13.770 --> 01:40:15.780
"Truudus."

01:40:17.610 --> 01:40:19.860
Truudus.
- Yes.

01:40:23.700 --> 01:40:27.750
I'm in peace with my past.

01:40:28.250 --> 01:40:32.670
"To be at peace with something"
is the correct expression.

01:40:33.880 --> 01:40:38.130
I'm at peace with my past.
What about you?

01:40:42.970 --> 01:40:47.350
Honey. Bunny. My love.

01:40:49.310 --> 01:40:51.400
What did you say?

01:40:55.690 --> 01:40:59.320
For you, a lie is a chair
you can sit on for a moment.

01:40:59.450 --> 01:41:03.820
For me, a lie is a chair
I can sit on for a moment -

01:41:03.950 --> 01:41:07.830
before continuing my journey.
Nothing more, Bunny.

01:41:07.950 --> 01:41:11.120
Hi!
- Hi.

01:41:13.920 --> 01:41:17.840
Sometimes I fall for the idea
that something will change.

01:41:18.920 --> 01:41:21.880
For the idea that I'll change.

01:41:22.010 --> 01:41:29.060
But no, nothing ever changes.
No one ever learns anything.

01:43:27.640 --> 01:43:31.180
Case Number 1: Closed.

01:45:15.620 --> 01:45:18.700
"He has fenced up my way,
so that I cannot pass;

01:45:18.830 --> 01:45:21.370
And He has set darkness
in my paths."

01:45:21.500 --> 01:45:25.880
"He has stripped me of my glory,
And taken the crown from my head."

01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:29.170
"He breaks me down on every side,
And I am gone;

01:45:29.300 --> 01:45:33.050
My hope He has uprooted
like a tree." JOB 19:8-10

01:45:33.180 --> 01:45:40.430
It's not you. It's me.
