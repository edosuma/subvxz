We lose power,
reactor meltdown.

00:09.661 --> 00:12.142
- Gennys will kick in

00:13.883 --> 00:15.450
- FBI, HRT, and SWAT

00:22.674 --> 00:24.676

00:24.720 --> 00:26.504
- Fuel pool two breach.

- Check your void coefficient.

00:28.550 --> 00:29.551

00:29.594 --> 00:30.552
- We lose that water,

00:30.595 --> 00:31.857
goodbye New York.

00:31.901 --> 00:34.077
- Shut it down.
Lock controls.

We're red.

- Ready, clear!

00:50.833 --> 00:52.313
- Get down!
- On the ground!

00:52.356 --> 00:53.488
- Get down right now!

00:53.531 --> 00:55.316
- Away from the terminal!

00:55.359 --> 00:58.362

Back up, back up!

01:16.337 --> 01:18.469
Great job, everybody,

'cause that can't happen

01:22.865 --> 01:24.258

01:24.301 --> 01:26.347
- Get cameras back online.

Todd is with

03:14.672 --> 03:15.891
She was an investigator

03:15.934 --> 03:17.806
for the Inspector General's
office.

03:17.849 --> 03:19.199
- So her job was to make sure

03:19.242 --> 03:20.678
nothing falls
through the cracks.

03:21.984 --> 03:24.029
- No, she covers

03:24.073 --> 03:27.685
- Wait, wait!

03:27.729 --> 03:30.775
I want to see her face.

03:33.909 --> 03:35.171
- Don't get too close.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.825
She's radioactive.

03:38.261 --> 03:39.219
- There was a problem
last night

03:39.262 --> 03:41.264
in the fuel pool.

03:44.528 --> 03:46.138
- It's where uranium
gets cooled.

03:47.357 --> 03:48.532
- Air seal failure.

03:48.576 --> 03:50.186
Thankfully we repaired it
quickly.

03:51.405 --> 03:52.797
- No, we just checked
the valves.

03:52.841 --> 03:54.495
They weren't due to be replaced
for a while.

03:56.279 --> 03:58.368
- Officially, we're still
investigating.

04:01.632 --> 04:02.633
Did Cameron have a reason

04:02.677 --> 04:03.678
to be near the fuel pool?

04:03.721 --> 04:05.114
- Not that I'm aware of.

04:05.157 --> 04:07.029
In fact, I don't even know
why she was here.

04:07.072 --> 04:08.465
According to the IG's office,

04:08.509 --> 04:10.162
there wasn't even
an open investigation

04:10.206 --> 04:12.730
into this plant.

04:12.774 --> 04:14.906
This plant is a catch-22
for everybody.

04:14.950 --> 04:16.778
We power New York.

04:16.821 --> 04:19.520
Unfortunately, we also have
the power to destroy it.

04:20.999 --> 04:22.523
- Uncooled fuel rods
will melt down

04:22.566 --> 04:24.133
to the ground water,
poisoning everything

04:24.176 --> 04:25.656
for 60 miles
in every direction.

04:25.700 --> 04:27.005
- But that's not gonna
happen, right?

04:27.049 --> 04:28.442
- Not if I can help it.

04:28.485 --> 04:30.574
- So the victim's body
was radioactive.

04:30.618 --> 04:32.010
Sabotage happened in here
last night.

04:32.054 --> 04:33.403
That's a coincidence?

04:33.447 --> 04:34.883
- Cameron didn't have
the knowledge

04:34.926 --> 04:36.841
or the expertise
to release the air seals.

04:38.930 --> 04:40.323
She didn't mention it.

04:40.367 --> 04:42.325
- Cameron have any enemies
you're aware of?

04:42.369 --> 04:44.458
- No one likes anybody
looking over their shoulder.

04:44.501 --> 04:46.460
But as far as inspectors go,

04:46.503 --> 04:49.201
she was always fair.

04:50.899 --> 04:52.335
- I want to see
the security footage.

04:52.379 --> 04:54.468
- That might be a problem.

04:54.511 --> 04:55.904
- The feeds were cut
at the front gate,

04:55.947 --> 04:59.516
backup generators,
fuel pools two and three.

04:59.560 --> 05:00.865
- So the cameras malfunctioning

05:00.909 --> 05:02.214
are part of the drill?

05:02.258 --> 05:04.129
- Yes, to simulate
a coordinated

05:04.173 --> 05:05.435
terrorist attack on the plant.

05:05.479 --> 05:06.828
Well, some of them.

05:06.871 --> 05:08.177
- What do you mean,
some of them?

05:08.220 --> 05:09.918
- Well, the system's glitchy.

05:09.961 --> 05:13.922
A few cameras were
already broken before.

05:13.965 --> 05:15.576
Look, I know what
you're thinking.

05:15.619 --> 05:16.620
The ammo was locked in here.

05:16.664 --> 05:18.013
I had the only key.

05:18.056 --> 05:20.363
No one went anywhere near
that stuff.

05:20.407 --> 05:21.538
- Good to know.

05:21.582 --> 05:23.584
We were asking
about the cameras.

05:23.627 --> 05:25.977
- I document everything
I'm supposed to.

05:26.021 --> 05:27.501
They know about the cameras.

05:27.544 --> 05:29.590
- It's your job to keep
this plant secure.

05:29.633 --> 05:31.461
- This isn't the military.

05:31.505 --> 05:33.376
Power plants are run
by private companies.

05:33.420 --> 05:34.812
I got kids.

05:34.856 --> 05:36.161
We live a mile from here.

05:36.205 --> 05:38.381
I want to keep them safe.

05:38.425 --> 05:39.730
But I got to put food
on the table.

05:39.774 --> 05:42.342
I work with what they give me.

05:44.387 --> 05:46.346
- Tell us about Cameron.

05:46.389 --> 05:48.304
- Look, she was one
of the good ones.

05:48.348 --> 05:50.045
Some inspectors will
write you up

05:50.088 --> 05:52.134
to make themselves look good.

05:52.177 --> 05:53.135
Not Cameron.

05:53.178 --> 05:55.398
She really cared.

05:55.442 --> 05:56.660
- Any idea what time

05:56.704 --> 05:58.488
she got to the plant
last night?

05:58.532 --> 06:00.664
- Let's see.

06:02.797 --> 06:06.322
She signed in at the gate
at 10:00 pm.

06:06.366 --> 06:09.151
- We get that you
have to work here.

06:09.194 --> 06:10.370
You want to help Cameron,

06:10.413 --> 06:12.415
tell us where to look.

06:21.598 --> 06:23.121
- Garret Sebastian.

06:23.165 --> 06:25.472
I saw her arguing with him
a few days back.

06:25.515 --> 06:28.605
Guy's just a plumber,
so go figure.

06:28.649 --> 06:32.261
- We didn't hear it from you.

06:35.177 --> 06:36.483
- I had no beef with Cameron.

06:36.526 --> 06:37.745
- You were seen arguing
with her.

06:39.050 --> 06:40.443
'Cause nosy people,

06:40.487 --> 06:41.488
they ought to stick around
for the whole show.

06:41.531 --> 06:42.924
- Well, now she's gone.

06:42.967 --> 06:44.273
So how 'bout you tell us
the whole show?

06:44.316 --> 06:45.274
- It wasn't an argument.

06:45.317 --> 06:46.797
It was a loud conversation.

06:46.841 --> 06:49.104
- What were you loudly
conversing about?

06:49.147 --> 06:50.845
- She thought I had
something to say.

06:51.889 --> 06:52.847
- I didn't.

06:52.890 --> 06:54.457
- Hey.

06:54.501 --> 06:55.589
Not answering questions

06:55.632 --> 06:56.590
makes you look more guilty.

06:56.633 --> 06:57.634
You get that, right?

06:57.678 --> 06:59.419
- IG tip line, HR interviews,

06:59.462 --> 07:01.421
that stuff's supposed to be
confidential.

07:01.464 --> 07:03.292
She had no right
coming at me like that

07:03.335 --> 07:04.293
right out in the open.

07:05.773 --> 07:08.906
- I don't know.
I didn't let her get that far.

07:10.386 --> 07:12.475
During the drill?

07:17.045 --> 07:18.481
- I was in the switch room
clearing a drain.

07:18.525 --> 07:19.656
It took hours.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.876
All I did last night
was my job.

07:21.919 --> 07:23.486
You guys want to ask me
any more questions,

07:23.530 --> 07:26.358
I want a lawyer.

07:28.491 --> 07:30.014
- Press is chumming the waters

07:30.058 --> 07:31.929
looking to connect Cameron
with the sabotage.

07:31.973 --> 07:33.104
- I guess the air seals
weren't

07:33.148 --> 07:34.628
the only leak at the plant.

07:34.671 --> 07:35.716
- I'm combing through
the security footage

07:35.759 --> 07:36.717
but there isn't much there.

07:36.760 --> 07:37.979
- Yeah.

07:38.022 --> 07:39.502
They had troubles
with the cameras.

07:39.546 --> 07:40.808
- The company line is that

07:40.851 --> 07:41.809
the place is up to code.

07:41.852 --> 07:42.810
And they're lying

07:42.853 --> 07:44.202
through their teeth.

07:44.246 --> 07:45.682
- So what do we know
about Cameron?

07:45.726 --> 07:46.901
- Uh, Kris was about to

07:46.944 --> 07:48.511
bring us up to speed.
Go.

07:48.555 --> 07:50.382
- Uh, 37-year-old workaholic.

07:50.426 --> 07:52.602
Lived alone,
lot of Chinese takeout.

07:54.561 --> 07:57.259
- I prefer Mexican.

07:57.302 --> 07:58.608
- Credit card records indicate

07:58.652 --> 07:59.957
no hint of a social life.

08:00.001 --> 08:01.829
Lot of forced vacations
at home.

08:01.872 --> 08:03.483
Never left the country
until this past June

08:03.526 --> 08:07.008
when she visited,
of all places, Cuba.

08:08.575 --> 08:09.967
- We get reports
from the M.E. yet?

08:10.011 --> 08:10.968
- Yeah, she was shot
with a .22

08:11.012 --> 08:12.274
at close range.

08:12.317 --> 08:13.884
- ATF is running
gun registrations

08:13.928 --> 08:14.972
on 1,000 employees

08:15.016 --> 08:16.278
and subcontractors.

08:16.321 --> 08:17.279
- Make sure that
Garret Sebastian's

08:17.322 --> 08:18.280
on that list.

08:19.499 --> 08:20.761
Why, you like him for this?

08:20.804 --> 08:23.111
- I don't know, but
something's off.

08:23.154 --> 08:25.809
- Oh, ERT didn't find
any drag marks.

08:25.853 --> 08:27.811
- So she was shot
in the woods.

08:27.855 --> 08:28.812
- So how'd she wind up

08:28.856 --> 08:30.161
radioactive and wet?

08:30.205 --> 08:31.815
- We don't have a cellphone
yet either.

08:31.859 --> 08:33.730
- We subpoenaed
her phone records.

08:33.774 --> 08:35.515
Yesterday she made a couple
calls into the office

08:35.558 --> 08:36.907
and then one to a burner

08:36.951 --> 08:38.648
but, uh, it's shut off now.

08:38.692 --> 08:39.997
- All right, so what are
we thinking here?

08:40.041 --> 08:41.825
- Well, sabotage happened

08:41.869 --> 08:43.000
in the fuel pool room.

08:43.044 --> 08:44.654
Cameron was in the pool room

08:44.698 --> 08:46.308
but she wasn't supposed
to be there.

08:46.351 --> 08:48.876
- So she could have caught
the saboteur in the act.

08:48.919 --> 08:50.225
- Or she was responsible.

08:50.268 --> 08:51.618
- No. Cameron had access

08:51.661 --> 08:52.619
but she didn't have
the expertise

08:52.662 --> 08:54.055
to sabotage it.

08:54.098 --> 08:55.926
- So maybe whoever had
the expertise

08:55.970 --> 08:57.275
got access from her.

08:58.842 --> 09:01.584
- Ideology, coercion, or con.

09:01.628 --> 09:03.368
- She was single, vulnerable.

09:03.412 --> 09:05.022
That makes her a good target.

09:05.066 --> 09:06.502
- And once the deed was done,

09:06.546 --> 09:08.199
no reason to leave a witness.

09:09.897 --> 09:11.812
The sabotage wasn't even
successful.

09:11.855 --> 09:14.249
- That's right, which means
they could try again.

09:14.292 --> 09:15.685
At this plant or another.

09:15.729 --> 09:17.818
Keep working.

09:19.820 --> 09:20.821
- Looks like this woman lived
out of her car.

09:20.864 --> 09:22.474
- Well, that makes sense.

09:22.518 --> 09:24.433
She spent all her time
driving from plant to plant.

09:25.695 --> 09:28.089
Case files, notes?

09:28.132 --> 09:31.005
- Maybe she left them at home.

09:33.921 --> 09:35.270
You should get out more.

09:35.313 --> 09:36.314
- You first.

09:36.358 --> 09:38.665
- I mean, I date.

09:38.708 --> 09:42.669
- I meant the door.

09:42.712 --> 09:47.282
- The door's open.

09:50.328 --> 09:53.027
♪

09:53.070 --> 09:54.028
- FBI.

09:56.421 --> 09:57.379
Who are you?

09:57.422 --> 09:59.555
- Uh, Valerie Borgia.

09:59.599 --> 10:02.558
I work--worked with Cameron.

10:03.690 --> 10:07.084
- I--I was her best friend.

10:07.128 --> 10:09.217
I was stocking the fridge
for her parents.

10:09.260 --> 10:11.088
They're flying in.

10:12.699 --> 10:14.439
- She has...

10:14.483 --> 10:16.311
Had mine.

10:16.354 --> 10:17.660
- When was the last time
you talked to Cameron?

10:17.704 --> 10:20.010
- Yesterday from the office.

10:22.186 --> 10:24.972
- Normal.
A little distracted, maybe.

10:26.843 --> 10:29.454
- No, nothing that tripped
any alarms.

10:30.934 --> 10:32.501
- Work stuff.

10:32.544 --> 10:33.633
Cam had a report due

10:33.676 --> 10:34.677
on one of her other sites.

10:34.721 --> 10:35.678
I was checking in

10:35.722 --> 10:37.637
to see how it was going.

10:41.379 --> 10:44.165
I can't believe she's gone.

10:44.208 --> 10:46.210
- What can you tell me
about her?

10:46.254 --> 10:49.126
Cameron was so kind.

10:49.170 --> 10:50.562
Loving.

10:50.606 --> 10:52.652
No way she did
what they're saying.

10:52.695 --> 10:54.218
- Well, how can you be
so sure?

10:54.262 --> 10:55.524
- Cameron devoted her life

10:55.567 --> 10:57.700
to keeping nuclear power safe.

10:57.744 --> 10:59.441
She was a dedicated
investigator.

10:59.484 --> 11:00.616
- It takes a lot

11:00.660 --> 11:02.139
to uncover corruption
and fraud.

11:02.183 --> 11:04.141
- And she didn't back down.

11:04.185 --> 11:06.753
She didn't care about
blowbacks or repercussions.

11:06.796 --> 11:10.278
- I knew someone like that.

11:10.321 --> 11:11.714
It takes a lot of courage,

11:11.758 --> 11:13.890
actually.

11:13.934 --> 11:16.371
- I'm an investigator too.

11:16.414 --> 11:17.546
I know you can't promise

11:17.589 --> 11:18.547
you'll find who did this...

11:18.590 --> 11:19.766
- No.

11:19.809 --> 11:20.941
But I can promise you
that we'll do

11:20.984 --> 11:22.159
everything we can

11:22.203 --> 11:24.727
to find out the truth
for Cameron.

11:26.990 --> 11:29.427
- I know you guys
have a job to do.

11:29.471 --> 11:31.865
I'll get out of your way.

11:46.140 --> 11:47.445
- You said you knew someone
like that,

11:47.489 --> 11:50.927
takes a lot of courage?

11:50.971 --> 11:52.624
- That's not a laptop.

11:52.668 --> 11:53.756
- This is an ovulation kit.

11:53.800 --> 11:55.976
Maybe she did have a life.

11:56.019 --> 11:57.978
- Or she was just
freezing her eggs.

11:58.021 --> 11:59.544
I mean, it's what somebody does

11:59.588 --> 12:01.721
when the clock's running out.

12:08.989 --> 12:11.687
My husband Jason
wanted to have kids.

12:11.731 --> 12:14.734
I put it off.

12:20.000 --> 12:22.829
There's...someone else
in this photo.

12:22.872 --> 12:25.309
It's hidden by the frame.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.012
- Why hide a photo

12:32.055 --> 12:33.970
of what looks like
her boyfriend?

12:35.842 --> 12:36.799
- Yeah.

12:36.843 --> 12:39.019
Why do I recognize him?

12:43.066 --> 12:44.415
- Ladies and gentlemen,

12:44.459 --> 12:46.069
meet the impressive
Jake Fletcher.

12:46.113 --> 12:47.810
Nuclear engineer and...

12:47.854 --> 12:49.899
one of our Ten Most Wanted.

12:49.943 --> 12:51.248
Charged with disclosing

12:51.292 --> 12:53.337
top-secret government
documents.

12:53.381 --> 12:54.817
Claimed crime of conscience.

12:54.861 --> 12:55.862
Kris.

12:55.905 --> 12:57.428
- Fletcher, Jake, PhD,

12:57.472 --> 13:00.170
was a resident inspector
at ArrowPoint.

13:00.214 --> 13:02.085
Then three years ago
an internal investigation

13:02.129 --> 13:04.218
was initiated
into co-worker claims

13:04.261 --> 13:06.089
that he became paranoid
and abusive.

13:06.133 --> 13:07.482
- The report confirmed that

13:07.525 --> 13:08.875
he had created
a toxic environment.

13:08.918 --> 13:10.137
He was fired
six months later.

13:10.180 --> 13:11.442
- Fletcher claimed
he was set up

13:11.486 --> 13:12.487
because he wouldn't stay quiet

13:12.530 --> 13:14.054
about problems at the plant.

13:14.097 --> 13:16.056
He then released
classified documents online.

13:16.099 --> 13:17.535
- What was the information
he leaked?

13:17.579 --> 13:19.842
- Reports detailing
plant weaknesses.

13:19.886 --> 13:21.931
- Great, guy wants revenge
for getting fired,

13:21.975 --> 13:23.672
betrays his country,
endangering the lives

13:23.715 --> 13:25.239
of his fellow Americans.

13:25.282 --> 13:26.631
- Some call him
a whistleblower.

13:26.675 --> 13:28.851
- I would call him
a narcissistic traitor.

13:28.895 --> 13:31.158
- Anyway, Fletcher
evaded capture

13:31.201 --> 13:32.724
and he fled to Cuba,

13:32.768 --> 13:34.596
where he's lived
for the last 2 1/2 years.

13:34.639 --> 13:37.251
- Did Cameron and Fletcher
ever overlap at ArrowPoint?

13:37.294 --> 13:38.861
- Indeed, for six months.

13:38.905 --> 13:39.993
And...

13:40.036 --> 13:41.472
- Cameron's first investigation

13:41.516 --> 13:42.865
was into Fletcher.

13:42.909 --> 13:44.171
- Right.

13:44.214 --> 13:45.607
- CIA has some fun facts

13:45.650 --> 13:47.609
about Fletcher's activities
in Cuba.

13:47.652 --> 13:49.654
Annie, you want to give us
a glimpse?

13:49.698 --> 13:51.482
- Met with nuclear engineers

13:51.526 --> 13:53.745
from some very unfriendly
countries,

13:53.789 --> 13:56.661
Iran, North Korea, Pakistan.

13:56.705 --> 13:58.359
- Yeah, so he's a traitor.

13:58.402 --> 14:00.665
Working with our enemies
to exact revenge.

14:00.709 --> 14:02.102
- The sabotage happened here.

14:02.145 --> 14:03.146
And Fletcher's in Cuba;

14:03.190 --> 14:04.147
he's not even in New York.

14:05.192 --> 14:06.193
You want to give them

14:06.236 --> 14:07.847
the bad news, or should I?

14:07.890 --> 14:09.631
- Three days ago, Fletcher
crossed the Canadian border

14:09.674 --> 14:10.980
into Vermont.

14:11.024 --> 14:12.677
He was long gone
by the time we got there.

14:12.721 --> 14:14.462
- Yeah, but how did the CIA

14:14.505 --> 14:16.290
miss Fletcher leaving Cuba?

14:16.333 --> 14:19.423
- Traitors don't usually
come home on their own.

14:19.467 --> 14:22.078
- Well, it looks like
this one did.

14:31.392 --> 14:32.393
- All right, so a murdered
IG investigator

14:32.436 --> 14:33.916
and her fugitive boyfriend

14:33.960 --> 14:36.614
tried to sabotage
a nuclear power plant.

14:36.658 --> 14:37.702
It didn't work.

14:37.746 --> 14:39.356
- We got an APB out
on Jake Fletcher.

14:39.400 --> 14:40.923
His photo's throughout
the tri-state area.

14:40.967 --> 14:42.229
- He'll pop his head up.

14:42.272 --> 14:44.013
- Hopefully before
it's too late.

14:44.057 --> 14:45.841
All right, what do we know
about whistleblowers?

14:45.885 --> 14:48.235
- Well, we know they
get attacked from every side.

14:48.278 --> 14:49.932
- Friends, even family
turn against them

14:49.976 --> 14:50.977
from the fallout.

14:51.020 --> 14:52.108
They feel persecuted.

14:53.153 --> 14:54.110
He dumped state secrets

14:54.154 --> 14:55.372
to the public.

14:55.416 --> 14:57.461
- Sometimes the public
needs to know.

14:57.505 --> 14:58.462
- Next comes paranoia,

14:58.506 --> 14:59.463
then righteous rage.

14:59.507 --> 15:00.943
They've convinced themselves

15:00.987 --> 15:02.292
they have every right
to strike back.

15:02.336 --> 15:03.380
- Well, for another attack,

15:03.424 --> 15:04.512
Fletcher'll need help.

15:04.555 --> 15:05.730
- Money, resources.

15:05.774 --> 15:06.993
A place to hide.

15:07.036 --> 15:08.733
- Okay, I want to be
really clear.

15:08.777 --> 15:11.345
Everything within 60 miles
of that nuclear plant

15:11.388 --> 15:13.216
is in the danger zone
for radiation exposure.

15:13.260 --> 15:14.217
- Yeah.

15:14.261 --> 15:15.610
- Uh, we get the case file

15:15.653 --> 15:17.481
on Fletcher's misconduct
investigation yet?

15:17.525 --> 15:18.526
- It's classified.

15:18.569 --> 15:20.006
I can't access it online.

15:20.049 --> 15:21.442
- I'll reach out to IG
and get clearance.

15:21.485 --> 15:23.009
- I can help.

15:23.052 --> 15:24.880
- So Fletcher felt he was doing
the right thing.

15:24.924 --> 15:25.968
He got punished for it.

15:26.012 --> 15:27.491
So what is his end game?

15:27.535 --> 15:29.363
- Uh, well, it could
just be ego.

15:29.406 --> 15:31.626
He sounded the alarm
on nuclear safety.

15:31.669 --> 15:33.062
So catastrophe
proves him right.

15:33.106 --> 15:35.325
- I'm telling you,
it's revenge.

15:35.369 --> 15:38.111
And now he works
with the other side.

15:38.154 --> 15:40.504
- Guys, found a friend
of Fletcher's.

15:40.548 --> 15:41.984
Uh, Richard Cook.

15:42.028 --> 15:44.813
A nuclear diver who works
at ArrowPoint.

15:44.856 --> 15:46.554
- Okay, everybody focus here.

15:46.597 --> 15:48.251
I want his LUDs,
complete digital footprint,

15:48.295 --> 15:49.992
home thoroughly searched.
Let's go.

15:50.036 --> 15:50.993
- Brace Cook hard.

15:51.037 --> 15:52.429
Find out what he knows.

15:52.473 --> 15:56.346
We need to get Fletcher
in here now.

15:56.390 --> 15:57.957
- Just 'cause
I was friends with Jake

15:58.000 --> 15:59.741
doesn't mean I helped him
cross the border.

15:59.784 --> 16:01.003
- That's a little tough to deny

16:01.047 --> 16:02.048
considering that you bought gas

16:02.091 --> 16:03.049
on the way to Vermont.

16:03.092 --> 16:04.354
And you took the back roads

16:04.398 --> 16:06.095
and avoided all the tolls
and cameras.

16:07.444 --> 16:08.489
I like nature.

16:08.532 --> 16:09.490
- How does an ex-Navy diver

16:09.533 --> 16:10.839
become friends with someone

16:10.882 --> 16:12.884
who's on the FBI's
Ten Most Wanted list?

16:12.928 --> 16:14.321
- Well, in some situations,

16:14.364 --> 16:16.976
breaking the law
is the right thing to do.

16:18.542 --> 16:20.283
- He did. And he's paying
for it.

16:20.327 --> 16:21.545
- No, he's running
around New York

16:21.589 --> 16:22.633
planning a massive attack.

16:22.677 --> 16:23.895
- You're wrong.

16:23.939 --> 16:25.462
Jake could have taken
any cushy job

16:25.506 --> 16:27.334
at Big Energy
like the rest of them.

16:27.377 --> 16:28.335
But instead,

16:28.378 --> 16:29.684
he's living out of a bag

16:29.727 --> 16:31.033
trying to save the world.

16:31.077 --> 16:32.469
- He's already killed
one person.

16:32.513 --> 16:33.949
- Jake is no killer.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.037
And he's not a criminal.

16:36.082 --> 16:37.300
He was framed?

16:37.344 --> 16:38.823
- Well, they couldn't
control him.

16:38.867 --> 16:41.043
So they had to get rid of him.

16:41.087 --> 16:42.740
He lost his job, his freedom,

16:42.784 --> 16:44.264
and his reputation.

16:44.307 --> 16:46.179
- So he's a guy
with nothing left to lose.

16:46.222 --> 16:47.528
- So what are you suggesting,

16:47.571 --> 16:49.791
that he would commit
nuclear sabotage?

16:49.834 --> 16:53.447
That goes against everything
he stands for.

16:53.490 --> 16:55.014
We done?

16:58.452 --> 16:59.627
- I don't know.

16:59.670 --> 17:01.150
I didn't even know
he was back.

17:01.194 --> 17:03.022
- You were Fletcher's friend.

17:03.065 --> 17:04.849
You're gonna help us
bring him in alive

17:04.893 --> 17:08.070
or this is not gonna
end well for him.

17:08.114 --> 17:09.985
Now we're done.

17:19.125 --> 17:20.517
- I don't know who to believe.

17:20.561 --> 17:22.084
- Valerie Borgia's at 26 Fed

17:22.128 --> 17:25.479
with the IG case file
against Jake Fletcher.

17:31.224 --> 17:32.399
Hey, Valerie.

17:32.442 --> 17:33.748
How you doing?

17:33.791 --> 17:35.271
- I was packing up
Cameron's desk

17:35.315 --> 17:38.100
when your boss asked
for Jake Fletcher's file.

17:38.144 --> 17:40.929
But it's not about me, so, um,

17:40.972 --> 17:42.626
how can I help?

17:42.670 --> 17:43.932
- Why'd the Inspector General

17:43.975 --> 17:45.499
open a case file
against Jake Fletcher?

17:45.542 --> 17:47.066
- Several anonymous complaints

17:47.109 --> 17:49.111
were posted on the IG website.

17:49.155 --> 17:50.852
Fletcher was accused
of abusive behavior

17:50.895 --> 17:53.507
and creating a chilled
work environment.

17:53.550 --> 17:55.291
- Was Garret Sebastian
one of them?

17:55.335 --> 17:57.554
- Tip line's supposed to be
anonymous.

17:57.598 --> 17:59.817
People said that Fletcher
was increasingly erratic,

17:59.861 --> 18:02.951
unstable, paranoid.

18:02.994 --> 18:05.345
Yeah, Fletcher was trying
to sound the alarm internally

18:05.388 --> 18:06.955
about plant safety.

18:06.998 --> 18:08.783
- What exactly did Fletcher say

18:08.826 --> 18:10.698
was going on at the plant?

18:10.741 --> 18:12.656
- He claimed that
they failed to replace

18:12.700 --> 18:14.658
a crucial water valve.

18:14.702 --> 18:16.704
And that's when he leaked
classified documents

18:16.747 --> 18:18.053
to the public.

18:18.097 --> 18:20.708
- You don't leak
classified information.

18:20.751 --> 18:22.231
- Cameron was pissed.

18:22.275 --> 18:25.191
We both were.

18:25.234 --> 18:28.150
- Then why did she
visit him in Cuba?

18:36.158 --> 18:37.116
- Cameron didn't tell you

18:37.159 --> 18:38.117
that she and Fletcher

18:38.160 --> 18:39.857
were having a relationship?

18:48.431 --> 18:51.478
- No, mm-mm.
I can't believe that.

18:51.521 --> 18:52.740
She was my best friend.

18:52.783 --> 18:56.874
Why would she keep that
from me?

18:56.918 --> 18:59.529
- Thank you.
- Thanks.

19:04.230 --> 19:05.448
- This whole nuclear world,

19:05.492 --> 19:06.580
everyone's got a secret.

19:06.623 --> 19:08.059
- "Chilled work environment."

19:08.103 --> 19:09.583
That's why these tip lines
are anonymous.

19:09.626 --> 19:11.062
- It's supposed to
protect whistleblowers

19:11.106 --> 19:12.238
from retribution.

19:14.501 --> 19:15.850
Someone that betrays
our country

19:15.893 --> 19:17.504
and leaks classified intel
to our enemies?

19:17.547 --> 19:18.635
- I think you're having trouble

19:18.679 --> 19:19.636
separating the two.

19:19.680 --> 19:20.985
- Maybe.

19:21.029 --> 19:23.118
Six months deep undercover
will do that.

19:23.162 --> 19:24.467
Special Forces,

19:24.511 --> 19:27.427
one leak, you never see
your family again.

19:29.777 --> 19:32.171
- Got a court order to get
Cameron's text messages.

19:32.214 --> 19:34.303
She received this the night
she was killed.

19:34.347 --> 19:37.088
- "Meet me at the plant.
I'll do what you want."

19:37.132 --> 19:39.221
- Came from Garret Sebastian's
IP address.

19:39.265 --> 19:40.222
- Huh.

19:40.266 --> 19:41.223
Somehow all the leaks

19:41.267 --> 19:42.311
go back to the plumber.

19:42.355 --> 19:43.312
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

19:43.356 --> 19:45.009
- Already tried.

19:45.053 --> 19:46.315
Well, just tell him
that I want to talk to him.

19:46.359 --> 19:47.316
It's only gonna take
one second.

19:47.360 --> 19:48.839
Well, I don't care.

19:48.883 --> 19:49.840
Just want to tell you
I know that he's--

19:50.885 --> 19:52.408
Oh, hey, hey, hey, hey.

19:52.452 --> 19:54.105
- He'll call you back.
- That was my lawyer!

19:54.149 --> 19:55.629
- When you get your call,

19:55.672 --> 19:56.934
tell him you're under arrest
for lying to the FBI.

19:58.327 --> 19:59.372
- Innocent people
don't ask that question.

19:59.415 --> 20:00.982
They just deny it.

20:01.025 --> 20:02.201
- We know that you
lured Cameron to the plant

20:02.244 --> 20:04.028
the night she was killed.

20:04.072 --> 20:05.421
- What the hell are you
talking about?

20:05.465 --> 20:06.814
- And usually they deny it
better than that.

20:06.857 --> 20:07.815
We have her texts.

20:07.858 --> 20:08.946
Get ahead of this.

20:08.990 --> 20:10.861
We find that gun, you're done.

20:10.905 --> 20:12.254
- I don't own a gun.

20:12.298 --> 20:14.561
- What did you argue
with her about?

20:14.604 --> 20:16.563
- Jake Fletcher.

20:16.606 --> 20:19.087
- She thought that I had
something to say about him.

20:19.130 --> 20:20.654
But I didn't.
It doesn't matter.

20:20.697 --> 20:21.655
- You're right, it doesn't.

20:21.698 --> 20:22.743
You're going to jail.

20:22.786 --> 20:25.441
- No, no, I'm being set up.

20:25.485 --> 20:28.488
- Did you sabotage
the nuclear power plant?

20:28.531 --> 20:30.011
- Yes.

20:30.054 --> 20:33.362
But I didn't kill Cameron.

20:33.406 --> 20:34.972
I didn't know that was
gonna happen.

20:35.016 --> 20:36.713
I was only supposed to get her
to the plant.

20:39.499 --> 20:41.457
- Not without my lawyer.

20:41.501 --> 20:44.330
I want a deal.

20:48.899 --> 20:50.466
- ASUA's waiting upstairs.

20:50.510 --> 20:51.641
This had better not be a game,
Mr. Sebastian.

20:51.685 --> 20:52.642
- Oh, it's a game.

20:52.686 --> 20:53.948
Here's how we play.

20:53.991 --> 20:54.949
They give me immunity,
I talk,

20:54.992 --> 20:56.342
everyone wins.

20:56.385 --> 20:57.473
- Well, it's gonna be
a short game.

20:57.517 --> 20:59.693
Through the detector, please.

21:01.303 --> 21:02.609
- On the ground!
- Hey, hey! Stop right there!

21:03.871 --> 21:04.828
- Down, down, down!

21:04.872 --> 21:05.960
!

21:06.003 --> 21:07.527
- Down!
On the ground!

21:07.570 --> 21:08.789
What?

21:08.832 --> 21:09.790
- On the ground!
Down!

21:09.833 --> 21:10.791
And don't move.

21:10.834 --> 21:12.575
Maggie, stay down.

21:12.619 --> 21:14.447
- It's the dirty bomb alert,
Maggie.

21:14.490 --> 21:16.231
- Don't move!

21:30.550 --> 21:31.899
- Our radiation exposure

21:31.942 --> 21:33.553
is pretty limited, OA.

21:33.596 --> 21:34.989
- 2016.

21:35.032 --> 21:37.208
Breakers tripped, cut power
to the reactor.

21:37.252 --> 21:39.123
Water pumps failed,
backup generators died.

21:39.167 --> 21:41.474
They called it
a near-miss meltdown.

21:41.517 --> 21:43.214
- You know way more
than you should

21:43.258 --> 21:44.520
about a nuclear power plant.

21:44.564 --> 21:46.914
- I was at a reunion
at West Point

21:46.957 --> 21:48.089
15 miles away from here.

21:48.132 --> 21:49.482
Everything within 50 miles

21:49.525 --> 21:51.179
is a peak injury zone.

21:51.222 --> 21:52.180
Does that sound like something

21:52.223 --> 21:54.182
that I should ignore?

21:58.404 --> 21:59.361
- Waiting for you
to tell us, Doc.

21:59.405 --> 22:00.928
- You're fine.

22:00.971 --> 22:02.582
Alarm was triggered
by Garret Sebastian

22:02.625 --> 22:04.540
sweating radionuclides.

22:04.584 --> 22:06.194
We admitted him to the ICU

22:06.237 --> 22:07.369
for acute radiation sickness.

22:07.413 --> 22:08.849
- He didn't look sick.

22:08.892 --> 22:10.590
- He probably thought
he had the flu.

22:10.633 --> 22:12.635
Symptoms first present
as nausea, fever, chills.

22:12.679 --> 22:14.202
- Sebastian works
at the power plant.

22:14.245 --> 22:15.203
Wouldn't he know
if he was exposed

22:15.246 --> 22:16.770
to too much radiation?

22:16.813 --> 22:18.685
- If he knew he'd been exposed
at the plant.

22:18.728 --> 22:20.513
But I don't think he did.

22:22.123 --> 22:23.559
- He ingested it.

22:23.603 --> 22:25.909
A significant amount
of strontium-90

22:25.953 --> 22:27.389
and cesium-137

22:27.433 --> 22:29.348
sometime in the last 12 hours.

22:29.391 --> 22:31.306
- So he was poisoned.

22:31.350 --> 22:32.829
- Would appear so, but...

22:32.873 --> 22:35.789
that's your domain.

22:35.832 --> 22:37.094
- Hey, uh...

22:37.138 --> 22:38.487
We need to talk to him.

22:38.531 --> 22:40.489
- Sorry, he won't be talking
to anyone.

22:40.533 --> 22:42.186
Except God.

22:44.537 --> 22:46.103
- The ERT found a thermos

22:46.147 --> 22:47.496
that was contaminated
with radioactive waste

22:47.540 --> 22:49.063
inside Sebastian's house.

22:49.106 --> 22:50.543
- Death by caffeine, sugar,
and isotopes.

22:50.586 --> 22:51.544
- Right, to keep him
from talking.

22:51.587 --> 22:52.762
So who was it?

22:52.806 --> 22:54.416
- Well, we know
it wasn't Cameron.

22:54.460 --> 22:55.417
- And Sebastian wouldn't have
killed himself,

22:55.461 --> 22:56.897
not like that.

22:56.940 --> 22:58.551
- Fletcher had motive
to kill Sebastian.

22:58.594 --> 23:00.944
- Fletcher doesn't have access
to nuclear waste.

23:00.988 --> 23:02.772
- Unless he still has
someone inside.

23:02.816 --> 23:04.383
- Like his Navy diver buddy.

23:08.735 --> 23:10.171
That's an awful way to die.

23:10.214 --> 23:12.042
- Who has access
to radioactive waste?

23:12.086 --> 23:14.436
- Maybe a quarter
of our employees.

23:14.480 --> 23:15.829
It gets cleaned
from the filters.

23:15.872 --> 23:17.874
HEPA, reactor water,
fuel pools.

23:17.918 --> 23:20.268
We take extreme
safety precautions.

23:20.311 --> 23:21.487
- Can it be removed
from the plant

23:21.530 --> 23:22.662
without tripping alarms?

23:22.705 --> 23:24.098
- The stuff that could kill you

23:24.141 --> 23:25.621
is carted or stored off site.

23:25.665 --> 23:27.231
No one goes near it
that doesn't need to.

23:27.275 --> 23:28.711
- Well, someone did.

23:28.755 --> 23:30.409
- Richard Cook have access
to the waste?

23:30.452 --> 23:32.236
- Of course.
All our divers do.

23:32.280 --> 23:36.066
- When's the last time
Cook made a dive?

23:36.110 --> 23:37.938
- Yesterday.

23:37.981 --> 23:39.505
This is weird.

23:39.548 --> 23:41.681
He's over his millirem limit.

23:41.724 --> 23:43.509
- English.

23:43.552 --> 23:46.773
- His level of exposure
to radiation.

23:46.816 --> 23:48.383
He doesn't have the dive time

23:48.427 --> 23:50.037
for his levels to be this high.

23:50.080 --> 23:51.386
- Handling radioactive waste

23:51.430 --> 23:54.824
would raise your
millirem level?

23:54.868 --> 23:56.478
Let's put eyes on him.

23:56.522 --> 23:58.349
- Cancel all of Cook's access
into the plant.

23:58.393 --> 24:00.395
Right away.

24:03.398 --> 24:04.617
Wait.

24:04.660 --> 24:06.488
He's just
dropping off supplies?

24:06.532 --> 24:08.490
- He could be leaving it
for Fletcher.

24:08.534 --> 24:10.231
- Had eyes on the boat
for an hour.

24:10.274 --> 24:12.146
It was swept.
There's not a soul onboard.

24:12.189 --> 24:13.626
- Arresting Cook
might spook Fletcher

24:13.669 --> 24:15.149
if he's around.

24:17.064 --> 24:19.501
- I'm going in,
I'm gonna check it again.

24:52.403 --> 24:59.410
♪

25:04.503 --> 25:05.721
- Bar Harbor, two o'clock.

25:05.765 --> 25:07.941
There's movement on that boat.

25:14.469 --> 25:16.689
- It's Fletcher.

25:16.732 --> 25:19.692
♪

25:22.738 --> 25:29.745
♪

25:49.635 --> 25:50.853
- All right.

25:50.897 --> 25:51.811
Hey.

25:51.854 --> 25:52.899
Congratulations.

25:52.942 --> 25:54.117
Capturing a Ten Most Wanted

25:54.161 --> 25:55.597
is a big win for the FBI

25:55.641 --> 25:56.642
and this team.

25:56.685 --> 25:57.860
- Sure is.

25:57.904 --> 25:58.905
But I think we should
withhold it

25:58.948 --> 26:01.951
from the press for the moment.

26:01.995 --> 26:03.692
Why?

26:03.736 --> 26:05.955
- Because right now all we have
is circumstantial.

26:05.999 --> 26:07.130
There's no physical evidence

26:07.174 --> 26:08.349
that puts Fletcher at the plant

26:08.392 --> 26:10.438
or ties him to either murder.

26:10.481 --> 26:11.613
- So you want a confession.

26:11.657 --> 26:14.311
- If we can get it.

26:14.355 --> 26:17.793
- I'm not sure Fletcher's
our killer.

26:17.837 --> 26:18.968
I'm not sure that he

26:19.012 --> 26:22.145
sabotaged the plant either.

26:28.587 --> 26:29.588
- Well, if he's not,

26:29.631 --> 26:30.589
there's still an active threat

26:30.632 --> 26:32.199
to the plant.

26:32.242 --> 26:34.027
- Maybe Fletcher knows
who it is.

26:34.070 --> 26:35.289
- We'll keep his capture quiet

26:35.332 --> 26:36.290
until you talk to him.

26:36.333 --> 26:37.334
- Okay.

26:37.378 --> 26:38.640
- Oh, uh, NSA released

26:38.684 --> 26:39.946
some more photos
of Cameron and Fletcher

26:39.989 --> 26:40.947
in Cuba.

26:40.990 --> 26:41.948
Might be something to use

26:41.991 --> 26:42.949
in the interrogation.

26:42.992 --> 26:45.995
- All right, thank you.

26:55.875 --> 26:58.138
- Mostly tourist pictures.
Nothing special.

27:00.880 --> 27:02.403
- Except the traditional
wedding bouquet.

27:02.446 --> 27:04.405
- No.

27:04.448 --> 27:06.276
Seriously, come on.

27:07.843 --> 27:09.236
- You gotta be kidding me.

27:09.279 --> 27:10.541
- Look, take a look
at their faces.

27:10.585 --> 27:12.805
And their eye contact,
their hands.

27:12.848 --> 27:14.241
- He conned her.

27:14.284 --> 27:15.634
He married her.

27:15.677 --> 27:16.852
He promised her the moon.

27:16.896 --> 27:18.898
She's lonely, his lie worked.

27:18.941 --> 27:21.204
And she gave him access
to the plant.

27:21.248 --> 27:22.902
- No.

27:22.945 --> 27:24.599
I think she believed him.

27:24.643 --> 27:25.687
And I think

27:25.731 --> 27:28.559
that he really loved her.

27:28.603 --> 27:29.865
- Okay, maybe
I'm missing something,

27:29.909 --> 27:33.477
but I had your back
out there with Dana.

27:33.521 --> 27:36.219
And honestly, I'm not seeing
what you are.

27:40.006 --> 27:42.356
- Uh, trace found
no radioactive isotopes

27:42.399 --> 27:44.184
on Fletcher's skin or clothes.

27:44.227 --> 27:45.925
- So he didn't
poison Sebastian?

27:45.968 --> 27:48.318
- It doesn't seem likely.

27:55.021 --> 27:56.457
- Maybe.

27:56.500 --> 27:57.763
The question is whether or not
he'll tell us.

27:57.806 --> 27:58.851
- All right.

27:58.894 --> 28:00.287
You think he loved Cameron.

28:00.330 --> 28:02.245
Why don't you use that?

28:05.118 --> 28:08.425
- I have nothing to say to you.

28:08.469 --> 28:10.776
Well...

28:10.819 --> 28:14.736
I only have one question.

28:14.780 --> 28:15.998
It's not about the plant.

28:16.042 --> 28:18.087
It's personal.

28:20.089 --> 28:22.701
Why did you marry Cameron?

28:27.357 --> 28:28.794
She's gone.

28:28.837 --> 28:31.187
She's dead.

28:31.231 --> 28:33.494
You're going to prison.

28:33.537 --> 28:36.671
Nothing's gonna change that.

28:36.715 --> 28:38.194
You have nothing to lose,

28:38.238 --> 28:42.111
so you might as well
be honest with me.

28:42.155 --> 28:44.897
- It's none
of your damn business.

28:48.814 --> 28:51.642
- She died alone.

28:51.686 --> 28:52.643
Cold.

28:52.687 --> 28:53.688
In the dirt

28:53.732 --> 28:55.342
with a bullet in her head.

28:55.385 --> 28:57.692
That doesn't bother you?

28:59.955 --> 29:01.478
Why did you marry Cameron?

29:01.522 --> 29:04.220
- Because she was
the love of my life.

29:05.961 --> 29:08.398
And because she was
the only one who believed me.

29:08.442 --> 29:12.011
- That why you risked
coming back into this country?

29:12.054 --> 29:14.317
- We wanted a family.

29:14.361 --> 29:16.058
Cameron saw her doctor.

29:16.102 --> 29:18.408
He said in vitro
was the only way.

29:18.452 --> 29:21.020
- You had to be here.

29:21.063 --> 29:24.240
- What was Cameron doing
at the plant that night?

29:24.284 --> 29:26.068
- She was driving back
from one of the sites

29:26.112 --> 29:30.812
when she got a text
from Garret Sebastian.

29:30.856 --> 29:32.509
He said he was ready
to go public.

29:32.553 --> 29:34.163
Clear my name.

29:36.687 --> 29:38.385
- I thought it was crap.

29:38.428 --> 29:39.647
Sebastian's a coward.

29:39.690 --> 29:42.041
Was jerking her around again.

29:43.520 --> 29:46.306
- She agreed.

29:46.349 --> 29:49.396
I fell asleep with the TV on.

29:49.439 --> 29:53.835
When I woke up, she was on it.

29:53.879 --> 29:57.273
News said she'd been murdered
at the plant.

29:57.317 --> 29:58.840
I thought I was...

29:58.884 --> 30:00.799
still asleep.

30:00.842 --> 30:03.149
Dreaming.

30:03.192 --> 30:04.715
I didn't believe it

30:04.759 --> 30:07.849
until I saw that our bed
hadn't been slept in.

30:11.635 --> 30:13.594
I'm never gonna hear
her voice again.

30:16.075 --> 30:17.032
- Okay.

30:17.076 --> 30:18.642
Now I have a question.

30:18.686 --> 30:21.036
You claim to have leaked
classified nuclear documents

30:21.080 --> 30:22.559
in the interest of the public.

30:22.603 --> 30:24.126
- It's the truth.

30:24.170 --> 30:25.432
- Why would you offer
to share what you know

30:25.475 --> 30:27.826
with our enemies?

30:30.654 --> 30:32.831
- Foreign nuclear
safety officials

30:32.874 --> 30:35.050
who experienced the same
pattern of corruption

30:35.094 --> 30:36.051
that I did at ArrowPoint.

30:37.096 --> 30:38.837
- Yeah, it's a fact.

30:38.880 --> 30:40.403
It's also a fact

30:40.447 --> 30:41.665
that a fire at ArrowPoint

30:41.709 --> 30:43.145
could devastate New York.

30:43.189 --> 30:44.930
Two major fires
in the last five years

30:44.973 --> 30:46.845
barely avoided a meltdown.

30:46.888 --> 30:48.890
A valve remains open
when it should be closed,

30:48.934 --> 30:49.891
draining water
from the reactor.

30:49.935 --> 30:51.806
What do you want me to do?

30:51.850 --> 30:52.851
- Your job.

30:52.894 --> 30:54.853
- I tried. Over and over.

30:54.896 --> 30:56.637
It did nothing.

30:56.680 --> 30:58.769
- Why didn't they just
replace the valve at the plant?

30:58.813 --> 31:00.597
- It's expensive.

31:00.641 --> 31:02.251
The plant's 50 years old.

31:02.295 --> 31:04.471
Yearly revenue of 13 billion.

31:04.514 --> 31:06.168
Corporate bosses aren't
going to spend money

31:06.212 --> 31:10.216
on an aging plant
that's closing in two years.

31:22.141 --> 31:23.751
I started to hope

31:23.794 --> 31:26.101
when Cameron came to Cuba.

31:26.145 --> 31:27.798
She said she'd been
digging around

31:27.842 --> 31:29.235
and that she realized that
the IG investigation

31:29.278 --> 31:30.758
was a sham.

31:30.801 --> 31:33.500
And that she believed
I was telling the truth.

31:33.543 --> 31:36.459
But any hope we had
of me clearing my name

31:36.503 --> 31:39.245
we soon figured out was bust.

31:39.288 --> 31:42.683
ArrowPoint
is hopelessly corrupt.

31:42.726 --> 31:44.598
- Did Cameron share
any of her suspicions

31:44.641 --> 31:46.339
about the plant
with anyone else?

31:46.382 --> 31:48.036
- Valerie Borgia.

31:48.080 --> 31:49.777
She's the only one Cameron told

31:49.820 --> 31:52.736
I was back in the country.

31:55.304 --> 31:57.176
- 9/11, terrorists planned
to crash a plane

31:57.219 --> 31:58.525
into the ArrowPoint domes.

31:58.568 --> 31:59.961
That would have meant
20 million lives

32:00.005 --> 32:01.180
instead of 3,500.

32:01.223 --> 32:02.703
- Okay, but they didn't.

32:02.746 --> 32:04.183
- Yeah, only because
they didn't realize

32:04.226 --> 32:06.011
how vulnerable the plant
really is.

32:06.054 --> 32:08.100
- So now they do.
But so do we.

32:08.143 --> 32:09.449
- Maggie, he broke the law.

32:09.492 --> 32:10.972
- And that makes him
a criminal.

32:11.016 --> 32:12.974
I'm not arguing
the legality of that.

32:13.018 --> 32:15.237
I'm arguing the morality.

32:15.281 --> 32:17.848
He risked everything
to reveal information

32:17.892 --> 32:20.590
that he thought
would save lives.

32:20.634 --> 32:22.636
It doesn't matter if it did.

32:22.679 --> 32:25.726
It matters that he tried.

32:35.997 --> 32:38.043
My husband was
an investigative reporter

32:38.086 --> 32:39.479
for the Journal.

32:39.522 --> 32:40.610
When he worked a story

32:40.654 --> 32:42.961
he would go days
without sleep.

32:43.004 --> 32:44.832
I mean, the hours were brutal.

32:44.875 --> 32:47.008
But he would do whatever
he had to do

32:47.052 --> 32:49.532
to meet a deadline
or get to the truth.

32:49.576 --> 32:53.014
- Sounds familiar.

32:53.058 --> 32:56.017
- Jason was working this big
Wall Street exposé.

32:56.061 --> 32:58.150
And he got so much pushback.

32:58.193 --> 32:59.803
But he wouldn't...

32:59.847 --> 33:02.850
- He wouldn't back down.

33:06.027 --> 33:08.116
- Never.

33:11.946 --> 33:13.817
One night,

33:13.861 --> 33:16.516
I was working
Organized Crime unit.

33:16.559 --> 33:19.171
Surveillance.

33:19.214 --> 33:22.043
And I had to cancel
dinner plans.

33:22.087 --> 33:26.091
Uh, he called me
and I couldn't pick up.

33:26.134 --> 33:29.268
That was at 2:56 am.

33:29.311 --> 33:32.358
At 3:01...

33:41.323 --> 33:44.152
At 3:01 a car plowed
through a red light

33:44.196 --> 33:47.373
and killed him.

33:52.160 --> 33:53.727
So I know

33:53.770 --> 33:56.599
how she felt about him.

33:56.643 --> 33:58.079
And I know how he felt

33:58.123 --> 34:01.952
about her being gone.

34:01.996 --> 34:03.954
- Maggie--
- Can you please just spare me

34:03.998 --> 34:05.869
the transference speech of,

34:05.913 --> 34:07.393
"It's only been a year"

34:07.436 --> 34:11.092
and "Give myself
time to grieve."

34:11.136 --> 34:12.833
- Sure.

34:12.876 --> 34:16.054
- Thank you.

34:23.713 --> 34:25.324
I'm not buying it,
Valerie.

34:25.367 --> 34:26.890
- Cameron was my friend.

34:28.153 --> 34:29.110
- Of course.

34:29.154 --> 34:30.285
- You knew that she was

34:30.329 --> 34:31.286
in a relationship with Fletcher

34:31.330 --> 34:32.461
and you also knew

34:32.505 --> 34:33.636
that he was
back in the country.

34:33.680 --> 34:35.334
- You withheld that information

34:35.377 --> 34:36.639
from the FBI.

34:36.683 --> 34:38.424
That alone is a felony.

34:39.947 --> 34:40.904
- You can be charged with
aiding and abetting

34:40.948 --> 34:42.471
a known fugitive.

34:42.515 --> 34:44.691
- Fletcher was on
the Ten Most Wanted list.

34:44.734 --> 34:46.432
- They'll be so happy to make
an example out of you.

34:46.475 --> 34:48.869
- Stop.

34:48.912 --> 34:50.305
What do you want to know?

34:50.349 --> 34:52.177
- You knew that Cameron
was going to the plant

34:52.220 --> 34:53.656
and you knew
she was being set up.

34:53.700 --> 34:55.354
- I knew Sebastian
texted her to come.

34:55.397 --> 34:58.444
I didn't know she would
end up...

34:59.271 --> 35:00.359
You don't understand.

35:00.402 --> 35:01.925
She wouldn't quit.

35:01.969 --> 35:03.536
It was like she'd been
brainwashed by Fletcher.

35:05.103 --> 35:06.843
- To believe that the plant
needed to shut down.

35:06.887 --> 35:08.018
No way that could happen.

35:09.194 --> 35:10.195
You're an inspector.

35:10.238 --> 35:12.675
So was it unsafe?

35:12.719 --> 35:14.590
- No.

35:14.634 --> 35:16.375
And we tried to get her
to understand that.

35:17.419 --> 35:18.377
- Everyone.

35:18.420 --> 35:19.421
The plant shuts down,

35:19.465 --> 35:20.422
the company loses money.

35:20.466 --> 35:21.597
Everyone's out of a job.

35:21.641 --> 35:22.946
Everyone knows that.

35:22.990 --> 35:24.252
- Who told Sebastian

35:24.296 --> 35:25.253
to have Cameron come

35:25.297 --> 35:26.298
by the plant that night?

35:26.341 --> 35:27.386
- The plant is safe.

35:27.429 --> 35:28.822
- That's not what we asked.

35:28.865 --> 35:31.346
Who, Valerie?

35:35.220 --> 35:38.614
- Inspector Miller.

35:38.658 --> 35:41.008
I had to tell him
about Fletcher.

35:41.051 --> 35:42.488
He's like a mentor
to all of us.

35:42.531 --> 35:43.924
We're all on the same team.

35:43.967 --> 35:45.752
- No you're not.

35:45.795 --> 35:49.190
You betrayed Cameron.

35:49.234 --> 35:51.627
- I swear.

35:51.671 --> 35:53.281
I didn't know
that he would do that.

35:53.325 --> 35:55.109
- Well, it doesn't matter.

35:55.153 --> 35:56.545
The second you text Miller

35:56.589 --> 35:58.591
to say that Fletcher
was back in the country,

35:58.634 --> 36:01.463
you killed your best friend.

36:07.295 --> 36:09.167
- All right, so Miller
is investigating

36:09.210 --> 36:11.299
a nuclear rod re-rack
in the fuel pool.

36:11.343 --> 36:13.083
You guys are gonna have to
go in and get him.

36:13.127 --> 36:14.737
- There's no way
he's gonna talk to us.

36:14.781 --> 36:15.738
- We have no physical evidence.

36:15.782 --> 36:16.739
We're not gonna get this guy

36:16.783 --> 36:17.784
without a confession.

36:17.827 --> 36:19.394
- So let's surprise him.

36:19.438 --> 36:20.830
- An ambush.

36:20.874 --> 36:22.832
Someone he least suspects.

36:22.876 --> 36:24.747
- So we need someone
who's fearless.

36:24.791 --> 36:27.446
With nothing left to lose.

36:27.489 --> 36:30.623
- We know just
the right person.

36:30.666 --> 36:32.799
- Do it.

36:41.329 --> 36:42.330
- Thought they would
cure cancer

36:42.374 --> 36:43.244
before these cameras
came back on.

36:43.288 --> 36:44.898
- Glad I could be of service.

36:44.941 --> 36:46.595
How many we got?

36:46.639 --> 36:48.771
- Every angle of the pool
is covered.

36:48.815 --> 36:51.426
- Folks, we got
a five-hour window.

36:51.470 --> 36:53.646
So let's move
like we have a purpose.

36:55.082 --> 36:56.866
- Isotopes clump together
under water.

36:56.910 --> 36:58.694
Moving faster
than the speed of light.

36:58.738 --> 37:01.001
- Great.

37:01.044 --> 37:02.350
Just get Miller talking

37:02.394 --> 37:03.743
and get the hell out,
you hear me?

37:03.786 --> 37:05.397
- Loud and clear.

37:05.440 --> 37:07.790
Okay. You are
on his home turf here.

37:07.834 --> 37:09.531
He feels safe, comfortable,
powerful.

37:09.575 --> 37:10.967
- He's not expecting you.

37:11.011 --> 37:13.143
Or that you're wired.

37:17.974 --> 37:21.543
- 2743,
transfer canister...

37:23.893 --> 37:26.635
Particles are in motion.

37:26.679 --> 37:30.160
- Be careful.

37:30.204 --> 37:31.988
It'd be tragic if you fell.

37:32.032 --> 37:34.600
- Wow.

37:34.643 --> 37:35.949
You look good, man.

37:35.992 --> 37:38.734
Cuba agrees with you.

37:40.214 --> 37:41.911
I'm surprised to see you.

37:41.955 --> 37:44.740
- No, you're not.

37:46.742 --> 37:48.701
- You knew I'd find a way.

37:48.744 --> 37:50.093
Just like I knew you'd land

37:50.137 --> 37:53.053
the cushy K street
lobbying job.

37:53.096 --> 37:54.446
I didn't know you were
a murderer.

37:54.489 --> 37:57.449
- My job is to protect
this plant

37:57.492 --> 37:59.451
and these people.

38:03.411 --> 38:04.847
- Your job

38:04.891 --> 38:06.545
is to protect the people

38:06.588 --> 38:09.417
from what could go wrong.

38:10.592 --> 38:12.377
Why did she have to die?

38:12.420 --> 38:14.292
- Collateral damage.

38:14.335 --> 38:17.077
- Collateral damage
is an accident.

38:17.120 --> 38:18.818
You planned this.

38:18.861 --> 38:19.819
You knew I was back

38:19.862 --> 38:21.386
and Cameron was digging.

38:21.429 --> 38:24.040
So you got that lowlife
Sebastian to lure her here

38:24.084 --> 38:25.564
and you did it
the night of the drill

38:25.607 --> 38:28.306
so no one could hear
the gunshot.

38:32.222 --> 38:36.444
Dousing her with fuel pool
water was a nice touch.

38:36.488 --> 38:40.927
