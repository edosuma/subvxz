WEBVTT

00:38.970 --> 00:41.600
OK, enough tuning already.

00:41.740 --> 00:44.330
Settle, people! Quiet, please!

00:44.470 --> 00:46.240
Strings.

00:46.370 --> 00:48.100
One and one, main title.

00:48.240 --> 00:50.340
And a one, two, three, four!

01:28.620 --> 01:29.910
Come on.

01:30.050 --> 01:33.040
Come on-a-rama. Come on.

01:35.120 --> 01:36.820
"Outlook not so good"?

01:36.960 --> 01:39.360
What? No way!
You try, Mouse.

01:42.960 --> 01:45.760
OK, Magic 8 Ball, last chance.

01:45.900 --> 01:51.240
This is gonna be the best,
most way not boring summer ever, right?

01:51.370 --> 01:52.740
Signs point to...

01:54.980 --> 01:57.500
..."Yes"! Yay! You rock, Mouse.

01:57.650 --> 01:59.740
Don't leave me hanging.

01:59.880 --> 02:01.610
Judy?
You almost ready?

02:01.750 --> 02:03.770
The bus will be here in five minutes.

02:03.920 --> 02:06.650
Uh-huh! I'm totally almost
ready!

02:06.790 --> 02:10.120
Good. You don't want to be late
for the last day of school.

02:10.930 --> 02:13.190
Let me see.
Shoes, shoes, shoes, shoes.

02:13.330 --> 02:16.060
Help me, Mouse! Where are my? Ah!

02:17.270 --> 02:18.530
Hairbrush, hairbrush, hairbrush.

02:18.670 --> 02:20.160
Oh, hairbrush!

02:20.300 --> 02:21.770
See, here's the thing, Mouse.

02:21.900 --> 02:24.530
You know how every summer
is "S" for Snoresville

02:24.670 --> 02:27.160
because all I ever do is
visit Grandma Lou and get a sunburn

02:27.310 --> 02:29.540
and pick my scabs and watch TV.

02:29.680 --> 02:31.040
And it's not even cable.

02:31.180 --> 02:35.210
But this summer is going to be different
because I have a plan.

02:35.350 --> 02:37.440
A P-L-A-N for the most super duper,

02:37.590 --> 02:39.280
double-rare, not bummer summer ev...

02:39.420 --> 02:40.720
Judy?
- Coming!

02:40.860 --> 02:42.790
Mouse.

02:45.660 --> 02:47.820
- Look, Mom!
- Hey.

02:47.960 --> 02:49.620
Look, Dad.
- Nice.

02:51.330 --> 02:52.360
Hi!

02:53.940 --> 02:56.170
Beat you to the bus, Stink. Bye!

02:58.340 --> 03:00.500
Is that a new trend?
Wearing pajamas to school?

03:00.640 --> 03:02.870
Let's just be happy
she remembered her shoes.

03:06.380 --> 03:07.470
Rocky!

03:07.620 --> 03:08.710
Judy!

03:09.820 --> 03:11.510
Last day! No more homework,
no more tests.

03:11.650 --> 03:14.180
No more fink-face Finch, the pest!

03:14.320 --> 03:15.550
Yeah!

03:26.200 --> 03:29.030
What's with the Mr. Potato Head hair?

03:29.170 --> 03:32.570
I wouldn't talk,
Mr. "Frank Eats Paste" Pearl.

03:36.840 --> 03:40.370
- For me?
- FYEO. "For Your Eyes Only. "

03:40.520 --> 03:41.850
And Amy and Rocky.

03:41.980 --> 03:43.750
"TP Meeting...

03:43.890 --> 03:45.050
Shhh!

03:46.090 --> 03:46.990
Shhh.

03:48.520 --> 03:51.220
...after school
for way important summer plan. "

04:08.510 --> 04:10.200
What's going on?

04:11.580 --> 04:13.210
Is it the last day of school
or something?

04:13.350 --> 04:15.440
Yay!

04:16.420 --> 04:17.649
Frank.

04:17.790 --> 04:20.910
Don't get too excited. There's still...

04:21.760 --> 04:24.750
...three hours and 27 minutes
until summer officially begins.

04:25.960 --> 04:27.890
In fact, guess what I have here?

04:28.030 --> 04:29.930
Hot off the press.
A pop quiz.

04:30.060 --> 04:31.430
What? No way!

04:31.570 --> 04:33.400
On the last day of school?!

04:33.530 --> 04:37.330
Just a few questions to make sure
that you were paying attention.

04:37.470 --> 04:39.960
All right.

04:40.110 --> 04:41.080
Question number one.

04:41.210 --> 04:45.440
How many times did I wear
a purple tie to school?

04:45.580 --> 04:48.450
- Twenty-seven! Twenty-seven!
- A hundred! A hundred!

04:48.580 --> 04:49.780
Never.

04:49.920 --> 04:52.110
"Never" is correct.
Excellent, Jessica.

04:52.250 --> 04:54.810
- Ha-ha.
- Fink-face Finch strikes again.

04:54.960 --> 04:56.750
Question number two.
- Aww.

04:56.890 --> 04:59.190
- How long did it take our class
- For me?

04:59.330 --> 05:01.350
- To go around the world?
Eight and a half days!

05:01.500 --> 05:03.290
You guys are breezing through these.

05:03.430 --> 05:05.090
These are too easy for you.
I gotta go deeper.

05:05.230 --> 05:08.760
Let's see, let's see, let's see here.
Ooh, oh, this is a good one.

05:08.900 --> 05:11.170
This is a big one.
Mucho grande.

05:11.310 --> 05:13.500
- Come on! Tell us!
- OK, OK, OK.

05:13.640 --> 05:16.170
Can anyone guess,
and this means you, class 3T,

05:16.310 --> 05:18.940
what I, Mr. Todd,
will be doing this summer?

05:21.980 --> 05:24.780
We need a clue!
Give us a clue!

05:24.920 --> 05:26.390
Clue! Clue! Clue! Clue!

05:26.520 --> 05:29.050
Clue! Clue! Clue!
Clue! Clue! Clue!

05:29.190 --> 05:32.850
OK, OK. Hold it to a dull roar, dull roar.

05:34.000 --> 05:35.050
Let's see.

05:35.200 --> 05:37.360
Ooh! I have the perfect clue.

05:38.270 --> 05:39.960
The clue is...

05:40.100 --> 05:41.800
Brrr!

05:41.940 --> 05:43.340
...cold.

05:43.470 --> 05:45.500
- Oh, refrigerator salesman!
- That's not bad.

05:45.640 --> 05:46.900
- Snow remover guy.
- That's clever.

05:47.040 --> 05:48.800
- Polar bear trainer!
- That's dangerous.

05:48.940 --> 05:51.640
Snowball fight. Snowball fighter.

05:53.480 --> 05:55.540
Antarctica is cold.

06:16.170 --> 06:18.730
Mr. Todd?
- Judy!

06:20.980 --> 06:24.210
Ooh! I know! You're going to Antarctica!
The real one!

06:24.350 --> 06:25.900
That's a great guess, but sadly, no.

06:26.050 --> 06:27.450
Any other guesses?

06:27.580 --> 06:29.140
All right.

06:30.650 --> 06:32.640
Well, don't say I didn't warn you.

06:35.590 --> 06:38.180
# Well, I come
from the teachers' break room

06:38.330 --> 06:40.120
# With a banjo on my knee

06:40.260 --> 06:44.430
# Now listen up, dear students
It's so elementary

06:44.570 --> 06:48.930
# World-class 3T
You'll wanna look for me

06:49.070 --> 06:50.770
# 'Cause if somehow you find me

06:50.910 --> 06:53.470
# There's a prize, oh, yes, sir-ee!

06:53.610 --> 06:56.940
# You'll see me at the mall,
the pool, the park and by the sea

06:57.080 --> 07:02.140
# And sometimes you'll find me
at the public library

07:02.280 --> 07:05.740
# Oh, class 3T
You'll wanna look for me

07:05.890 --> 07:08.150
# 'Cause if somehow you find me

07:08.290 --> 07:09.950
# There's a prize, oh, yes, sir-ee!

07:10.090 --> 07:11.990
# You'll see me at the mall

07:12.130 --> 07:14.220
# The pool, the park and by the sea

07:14.360 --> 07:18.990
# And sometimes you'll find me
at the public library

07:19.130 --> 07:22.760
# Oh, class 3T
You'll wanna look for me

07:22.900 --> 07:24.900
# 'Cause if somehow you find me

07:25.040 --> 07:27.010
# There's a prize, oh, yes, sir-ee! #

07:32.280 --> 07:34.770
All right, kids, let's go!
Let's go! Have a great summer!

07:34.920 --> 07:38.350
- Bye, Mr. Todd! Stay warm!
- I will.

07:38.490 --> 07:40.180
Stay Judy!

07:40.320 --> 07:41.810
- Whoa!
- Ooh!

07:49.930 --> 07:52.130
Last one in is a... Whoa!

07:55.170 --> 07:56.470
Hey, no fair!

07:58.770 --> 08:00.640
OK, TPers, are you ready

08:00.780 --> 08:04.300
for the most way rare,
double-cool summer plan ever?

08:04.450 --> 08:07.140
Time out. What's a TPer?

08:07.280 --> 08:09.610
Oh, we forgot.

08:09.750 --> 08:11.950
Amy's not a member.

08:12.090 --> 08:14.710
- A member of what?
- Of our club.

08:14.860 --> 08:17.690
- Quick, Frank, go find a toad.
- Me? You find a toad.

08:19.990 --> 08:20.960
Frank.

08:35.380 --> 08:36.309
Do you see anything?

08:36.440 --> 08:38.380
Rock. Rock.

08:38.510 --> 08:40.210
Not a rock.

08:42.980 --> 08:45.480
Why am I doing this again?

08:46.950 --> 08:49.820
Shh. You'll see.

08:49.960 --> 08:52.860
If he jumps on my face,
you are so dead.

08:52.990 --> 08:54.890
- Do you feel anything?
Yeah.

08:55.030 --> 08:59.130
A toad. A fat, slimy...

09:00.230 --> 09:03.000
Ew! Something just got wet!

09:03.140 --> 09:05.660
Toad pee!

09:07.740 --> 09:10.110
- Gross!
- Don't wipe it on her!

09:10.240 --> 09:12.640
- You are sick!
- Sick awesome!

09:12.780 --> 09:16.740
And now you're a member of our club,
the Toad Pee Club.

09:16.880 --> 09:20.050
Which means you're toad-ally cool.

09:20.690 --> 09:22.120
So...

09:22.260 --> 09:24.450
...are you ready for my plan?

09:24.590 --> 09:27.460
Introducing the one and only

09:27.600 --> 09:31.430
Judy Moody Mega-Rare
Not Bummer Summer Dare!

09:32.670 --> 09:33.730
I don't get it.

09:33.870 --> 09:36.740
OK, you know how
we always hate summer

09:36.870 --> 09:39.310
because it's boring
with a capital "B"?

09:39.440 --> 09:42.410
I don't hate summer.
I love summer.

09:42.540 --> 09:45.380
Anyway, this'll solve
all our problems.

09:45.510 --> 09:47.950
I spent two days
and 16 erasers figuring it out.

09:48.080 --> 09:50.680
"Ride Scream Monster, surf a wave. "

09:50.820 --> 09:52.620
- Are these the dares?
Yup.

09:52.750 --> 09:55.850
So we do these dares, and for each one,
we get ten Thrill Points.

09:55.990 --> 09:58.580
Plus Bonus Points
if we do something crazy like,

09:58.730 --> 10:01.660
ride the Scream Monster with no hands.

10:01.800 --> 10:03.230
Or Loser Points if we chicken out.

10:03.360 --> 10:07.460
At the end of summer, we add it all up,
and if we reach 100,

10:07.600 --> 10:10.470
then presto, whammo,
we just had the best summer ever!

10:10.610 --> 10:12.200
Is that thrilladelic or what?

10:12.340 --> 10:16.170
Um, it's thrilladelic, only...

10:16.310 --> 10:18.870
...I kind of forgot
to tell you something.

10:24.820 --> 10:28.650
Um... He forgot to tell you that...

10:28.790 --> 10:31.280
...he's going away for the summer.

10:31.430 --> 10:32.410
What?

10:33.460 --> 10:36.490
Yeah. To circus camp.

10:36.630 --> 10:39.000
I'm gonna learn how
to walk on a tightrope,

10:39.130 --> 10:41.430
and do magic tricks and stuff.

10:41.570 --> 10:44.060
And I won't be here, either.

10:44.210 --> 10:45.500
I'm going to Borneo.

10:51.650 --> 10:54.550
You guys!
I thought you were serious.

10:54.680 --> 10:57.780
Borneo?
What even is Borneo?

10:57.920 --> 11:02.120
It's an island in Indonesia.
And I am going with my mom.

11:02.260 --> 11:05.320
- We leave in a week.
- Me too.

11:06.260 --> 11:07.660
On Friday.

11:10.430 --> 11:12.230
That is so not fair!

11:12.370 --> 11:14.700
How am I supposed to have
the best summer ever,

11:14.840 --> 11:17.200
if you're not even here?

11:17.340 --> 11:20.770
I'm not going anywhere.
You can have fun with me.

11:22.640 --> 11:23.840
Great.

11:26.050 --> 11:27.380
Just great.

11:28.120 --> 11:30.240
It looks like somebody's
in a bad mood.

11:30.380 --> 11:32.150
Really? Who?

11:32.290 --> 11:35.410
She's mad because Rocky and Amy
are going away for the summer.

11:35.560 --> 11:38.750
Could you please not talk
with ABC peas in your mouth?

11:38.890 --> 11:41.020
ABC what? What?

11:41.160 --> 11:42.320
Already Been Chewed.

11:42.460 --> 11:43.560
Oh.

11:43.700 --> 11:44.760
Guys.

11:46.970 --> 11:48.230
Oh... OK, guys.

11:49.840 --> 11:51.330
Mind your manners, please.

11:51.470 --> 11:54.930
Anyway, I could care less
about Rocky and Amy.

11:55.080 --> 11:58.380
I mean, going to circus camp,
that's lame.

11:58.510 --> 12:00.880
Rocky's going to circus camp?
You know, that's a great idea.

12:01.020 --> 12:04.010
You know, I think his grandparents
used to run that, the famous Circus

12:04.150 --> 12:05.120
- Zangzini. Right.
- Zangzini.

12:05.250 --> 12:06.780
# A- B-C-D-E-F-G #

12:06.920 --> 12:09.750
Can we please not talk about Rocky?

12:09.890 --> 12:12.880
Hey, wanna know what
I'm doing this summer?

12:13.030 --> 12:14.890
- I'm gonna catch Bigfoot.
- Bigfoot?

12:15.030 --> 12:17.790
Where did you even hear about Bigfoot?

12:17.930 --> 12:20.260
Hello! He's all over the news.

12:20.400 --> 12:21.930
- Oh.
In the newspapers, too.

12:22.070 --> 12:24.630
Yeah, there have been Bigfoot
sightings everywhere.

12:24.770 --> 12:26.640
Sally Rottenberger saw him in the mall.

12:27.940 --> 12:29.100
At the mall?

12:29.240 --> 12:30.970
I thought Bigfoot lived in the woods.

12:31.980 --> 12:34.140
But sometimes he has to buy stuff.

12:34.280 --> 12:35.480
There's no such thing.

12:35.620 --> 12:37.550
Is too. Wanna help me catch him?

12:37.690 --> 12:41.350
I'd rather catch poison ivy.

12:48.030 --> 12:50.590
- Oh, thank you.
- Mom?

12:50.730 --> 12:51.930
Mm-hmm?

12:52.070 --> 12:54.830
Can I please,
with ice cream and sprinkles on top,

12:54.970 --> 12:56.940
go to circus camp? Please?

12:57.070 --> 13:00.470
Honey, I'm sorry. It's just too expensive,
you know? We can't afford it.

13:00.610 --> 13:03.410
But if I learn how to do circus stuff,

13:03.540 --> 13:05.670
I can quit school and you can
loan me out to a circus

13:05.810 --> 13:08.780
- and I'll make gobs of money. Please.
- OK, well...

13:08.920 --> 13:10.350
You're not quitting school

13:10.480 --> 13:13.420
and we're certainly not
loaning you out to a circus.

13:15.660 --> 13:19.420
No one in this family
has any imagination!

13:19.560 --> 13:23.930
And Rocky is a circus-freak,
leave-me-behind un-friend!

13:24.060 --> 13:26.620
I am never, not ever

13:26.770 --> 13:28.360
speaking to him again!

13:30.810 --> 13:33.100
But what if you hate circus camp?

13:33.240 --> 13:36.640
Are you nuts?
Why would I hate circus camp?

13:36.780 --> 13:38.440
Because it won't all be tons of fun.

13:38.580 --> 13:40.880
I bet they make you shovel elephant poop.

13:41.020 --> 13:42.380
Ha-ha. Good one.

13:42.520 --> 13:45.110
Yeah, and did you know
it weighs like 200 tons?

13:45.250 --> 13:47.220
Plus, it smells worse
than a corpse flower.

13:47.350 --> 13:51.050
Are you ready for your send-off, Rock?

13:51.190 --> 13:52.890
# For

13:53.030 --> 13:55.150
# He's a jolly good fellow

13:55.300 --> 13:57.530
# He looks like a bowl of Jell-O

13:57.670 --> 14:01.470
# And all his teeth are yellow

14:01.600 --> 14:03.800
# Which nobody can deny

14:03.940 --> 14:06.300
# And now we're saying goodbye

14:06.440 --> 14:08.640
# And now we're saying goodbye

14:08.780 --> 14:13.210
# For he's a jolly good fellow

14:13.350 --> 14:16.150
# But now we're saying goodbye #

14:16.280 --> 14:18.880
Bye, guys! Miss you!
See you in a while!

14:20.750 --> 14:22.120
Bye!

14:23.060 --> 14:25.080
Think of me when you're
on elephant poop duty.

14:25.230 --> 14:28.750
I will. And also when I'm
taming lions and juggling swords.

14:28.900 --> 14:30.990
- You ready, kiddo?
- Yeah.

14:34.200 --> 14:35.190
Bye.

14:39.340 --> 14:42.370
Bye, guys!
Don't have too much fun while I'm gone!

14:51.520 --> 14:53.880
Remember, if camp is super boring,

14:54.020 --> 14:55.750
you can always come home!

14:55.890 --> 14:59.090
And don't say I didn't
warn you about the poop!

14:59.230 --> 15:02.490
Oh, I forgot! I...

15:03.100 --> 15:05.860
I can't hear you!

15:16.780 --> 15:19.750
So why are you going to Bored-eo?

15:19.880 --> 15:23.040
Because of this lost tribe
called the Penan.

15:23.180 --> 15:25.910
They've lived in the rainforest
since forever,

15:26.050 --> 15:29.220
but all their land is being
destroyed because of logging.

15:29.360 --> 15:32.590
So anyways, my mom's going there
so she can write an article on them

15:32.730 --> 15:33.950
and hopefully we can save them.

15:34.090 --> 15:36.090
You're so lucky.

15:36.230 --> 15:38.200
I never get to save a lost tribe.

15:39.400 --> 15:40.630
I wish you could come.

15:46.210 --> 15:49.840
It's not that far away, you know.
It's only like 9,000 miles.

15:49.980 --> 15:51.910
Lots of people go to Borneo
for a vacation.

15:52.050 --> 15:53.340
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

15:53.480 --> 15:55.140
Does it cost like a zillion dollars?

15:55.280 --> 15:56.610
I don't think so.

15:58.090 --> 16:00.610
Then maybe we could go.

16:00.750 --> 16:03.810
There's no reason we have to spend
every summer at Grandma Lou's, right?

16:03.960 --> 16:06.290
Amy? Are you packed?
We leave in an hour.

16:06.430 --> 16:08.360
I'm ready!
Go ask your mom!

16:08.500 --> 16:10.050
I will! See ya!

16:11.500 --> 16:13.930
In case she says no,

16:14.070 --> 16:16.160
here's something to remember me by.

16:16.300 --> 16:17.900
Sweet.

16:19.910 --> 16:23.070
Oh, Borneo,
I long-e-o to visit you-e-o!

16:24.180 --> 16:26.270
Mom! Mom!

16:26.410 --> 16:28.140
- Oh, Mom! Guess what!
- Yeah?

16:28.280 --> 16:29.720
I figured out how to save summer!

16:29.850 --> 16:32.480
Save summer?
I didn't know it was in trouble.

16:32.620 --> 16:36.110
Listen to this. Instead of going
to Grandma Lou's, boring,

16:36.260 --> 16:38.120
let's go to un-boring Borneo!

16:38.260 --> 16:41.250
Borneo? OK, you know that's like
halfway around the world, right?

16:41.400 --> 16:44.520
So? It's got a rainforest.
And lost tribes that need to get found.

16:44.670 --> 16:47.130
OK, but do you have any idea
how expensive it would be...

16:47.270 --> 16:48.830
Oh, Stink!
We're going to Borneo!

16:48.970 --> 16:52.000
But we need money-o,
so let's have a yard sale!

16:52.140 --> 16:53.900
I'll sell my pizza table collection.

16:54.040 --> 16:57.140
That's right, five pizza tables,
only $9.99! Call now!

16:57.280 --> 16:59.040
Ooh! You can sell your
World's Biggest Jawbreaker.

16:59.180 --> 17:00.670
World's Biggest Jawbreaker, now
only...

17:00.810 --> 17:03.440
No can do. Can't. I'm busy.

17:04.319 --> 17:06.050
- Are these cranberries?
- Uh, yes.

17:06.190 --> 17:07.310
OK. Bye.

17:07.450 --> 17:09.720
What? Bye.

17:10.720 --> 17:12.089
OK, sweetie, can you just, um...

17:12.230 --> 17:13.490
You know what,
sit down for a second.

17:13.630 --> 17:15.930
I just wanna talk to you
about something.

17:16.060 --> 17:18.500
Um, so I was just on the phone

17:18.630 --> 17:20.690
with your other grandma,
you know, my mom.

17:20.829 --> 17:22.430
And you know how she and Gramps

17:22.569 --> 17:24.829
are moving to that
retirement community?

17:24.970 --> 17:27.339
Well, I'm afraid Gramps hurt his back,

17:27.470 --> 17:30.440
so he's gonna need a little help, so...

17:30.580 --> 17:33.740
You mean we're flying
to California to visit them?

17:33.880 --> 17:35.510
Now...

17:35.650 --> 17:37.410
That's almost as good as Borneo!

17:37.550 --> 17:39.520
- Yes! Yes!
- Hang tight for one second.

17:39.650 --> 17:42.420
Um, let me get a little more specific.

17:42.560 --> 17:43.920
- Thank you! Thank you!
- If I could just...

17:44.060 --> 17:47.260
- Did you tell her?
- Uh, not, not quite.

17:47.390 --> 17:50.020
- Honey.
- Listen, jelly bean.

17:51.100 --> 17:52.590
Something's come up.

17:52.730 --> 17:55.860
Your mom and I have to fly
to California in a few days...

17:56.000 --> 17:56.900
Yeah.

17:57.040 --> 17:58.800
...and you and Stink...

17:58.940 --> 18:00.930
...are staying here.

18:02.240 --> 18:05.800
What?
You're going to leave me here?

18:05.950 --> 18:10.710
To die of starvation
and boredom and Stink-dom?

18:10.850 --> 18:14.290
OK, kiddo, it is not gonna be that bad.

18:14.420 --> 18:15.450
Your Aunt Opal's coming.

18:15.590 --> 18:18.080
- Aunt who?
- My sister.

18:18.230 --> 18:20.590
Judy, you've heard me
mention her a million times.

18:20.730 --> 18:23.420
- So? I never actually met her.
- You did when you were little.

18:23.560 --> 18:26.430
She could be totally evil.
She could be a zombie for all I know.

18:26.570 --> 18:29.130
- Oh.
Do I look like a berry bush?

18:30.770 --> 18:33.470
Uh...
- I'm trying to fake out Bigfoot.

18:35.210 --> 18:37.340
Well, in that case, absolutely.

18:37.480 --> 18:39.570
- Oh, yes. 100 percent.
- Definitely.

18:39.710 --> 18:41.340
Yes! Great! Bye!

18:41.480 --> 18:43.780
So let me get this straight.

18:43.920 --> 18:47.980
I'm not going to California.
I'm not going to Borneo.

18:48.120 --> 18:51.750
I'm not going to circus camp. And now
I'm not even going to Grandma Lou's?

18:53.960 --> 18:58.020
Then this is the way worst,
double-drat, bummer summer ever!

19:06.310 --> 19:09.370
This is supposed to be
the summer of a hundred thrills.

19:09.510 --> 19:10.940
But instead...

19:11.080 --> 19:13.340
Judy, it's the ice cream truck!

19:13.480 --> 19:16.810
I am so not in the mood!

19:16.950 --> 19:18.440
Ow.

19:20.190 --> 19:23.950
Dear Magic 8 Ball,
could this summer get any worse?

19:25.260 --> 19:27.020
"Without a doubt"?

19:42.540 --> 19:45.770
Stink! Judy!
Aunt Opal's here!

19:49.620 --> 19:51.310
Opal, you're here!

19:51.450 --> 19:53.890
Opal! There she is!
Wow, it's been forever!

19:56.020 --> 19:58.080
Group hug!

20:01.800 --> 20:04.820
"Dear Amy,
summerjust got way worse.

20:04.970 --> 20:07.160
Aunt Awful has landed!

20:07.300 --> 20:09.240
Can't you please come home?

20:09.370 --> 20:11.430
Or else send me a ticket to Borneo?"

20:11.570 --> 20:13.940
Judy? Come down
and say hi to your aunt!

20:15.010 --> 20:17.810
I can't! Not until September!

20:19.350 --> 20:21.440
I bet she has warts, Mouse.

20:21.580 --> 20:23.680
And evil, oogley boogley eyes.

20:23.820 --> 20:26.120
And makes us eat fish guts for breakfast.

20:26.250 --> 20:29.350
Dad says come now
or you're in big trouble.

20:29.490 --> 20:30.850
Can't you read the sign?

20:30.990 --> 20:34.930
Where it says I'm spending
the summer in my room?

20:35.060 --> 20:37.390
Really? What about food?

20:42.200 --> 20:43.460
I have a basket.

20:43.600 --> 20:45.870
You can put food inside
and I'll lift it up.

20:46.010 --> 20:47.630
What about TV?

20:47.770 --> 20:49.710
Check it out.

20:52.510 --> 20:54.210
It's gonna be a periscope.

20:54.350 --> 20:56.870
- I'll be able to see the whole living room.
- Cool.

20:58.020 --> 20:59.950
What about going to the bathroom?

21:00.720 --> 21:01.750
Stink, I'm a...

21:03.290 --> 21:06.280
What's that?
Dinner's on fire!

21:06.430 --> 21:08.390
Don't worry!
I can put it out! Lobster!

21:12.200 --> 21:13.860
I can save us!
I'll get water!

21:14.900 --> 21:16.730
OK, hurry, hurry, hurry!

21:16.870 --> 21:19.170
I have water! I have water!

21:19.310 --> 21:21.270
I can put it out! Don't worry!

21:21.410 --> 21:23.810
Careful! Hot! Hot! Hot!
Take it to the sink!

21:23.940 --> 21:25.410
OK, watch it! Sink!

21:25.550 --> 21:28.340
- Judy, you don't need to do that anymore!
- Hey!

21:28.480 --> 21:30.140
Don't worry, I can put it out!

21:30.280 --> 21:31.310
It's OK, Judy.

21:33.920 --> 21:35.290
Bull's-eye!

21:35.420 --> 21:39.020
Wow, it's the famous Judy Moody!

21:41.630 --> 21:44.360
You are so cute!

21:44.500 --> 21:47.300
Opal, you've only been here five minutes,
and already the house is on fire.

21:47.430 --> 21:49.490
Unbelievable.

21:50.440 --> 21:53.130
Wow, you got so much bigger.
Do you remember this?

21:55.140 --> 21:56.940
Kinda.

21:57.080 --> 22:00.950
Wow. You've got more bracelets
than my math tutor,

22:01.080 --> 22:03.210
and she's in college.

22:03.350 --> 22:04.780
Here, you wanna have this one?

22:04.920 --> 22:06.820
- It's made out of yak hair.
- Really?

22:06.950 --> 22:08.750
I got it off a monkey for 500 rupees.

22:08.890 --> 22:11.790
Wow. Cool!

22:13.160 --> 22:15.560
Wow, thanks! Rare!

22:15.700 --> 22:17.820
OK, but here's your real presents.

22:17.960 --> 22:19.090
Stinker?

22:21.100 --> 22:22.760
Awesome!

22:24.540 --> 22:26.470
"So You Want to Catch Bigfoot?"

22:26.610 --> 22:29.040
Look, look, look, look! Awesome!

22:29.180 --> 22:30.970
Thank you, Aunt Opal!
Thank you! Thank you!

22:31.880 --> 22:34.810
Yeah! Man, oh, man, oh, man!

22:34.950 --> 22:36.420
Ye-ye-yeah!

22:36.550 --> 22:39.420
I got a Bigfoot!
Yeah! Book.

22:39.550 --> 22:43.280
Nice dance. OK.
And this is your present.

22:48.630 --> 22:51.320
A mood ring?

22:51.470 --> 22:53.260
How did you know?

22:53.400 --> 22:54.730
I think you're a big hit, Ope.

22:56.870 --> 22:58.930
- You like it?
- I love it!

22:59.070 --> 23:02.100
- Thank you!
Guys,

23:02.240 --> 23:05.370
I'm so sorry to interrupt,
but what do you wanna do about dinner?

23:07.050 --> 23:09.070
Pizza!

23:09.220 --> 23:13.880
A large Hawaiian Surprise
and a pepperoni with tuna fish.

23:16.560 --> 23:18.250
Wanna go to Fur and Fangs while we wait?

23:18.390 --> 23:19.380
Sure.

23:19.990 --> 23:23.590
Yay, 'cause I wanna show Zeke my book
and prove to you that Bigfoot exists.

23:24.500 --> 23:26.490
Right.

23:33.740 --> 23:34.900
Thank you.

23:35.580 --> 23:37.570
Hey, Zeke! Check this out!

23:37.710 --> 23:39.740
Hey, little dude.
Whoa.

23:39.880 --> 23:41.680
Sweet.

23:42.220 --> 23:44.120
It's a first edition.

23:45.420 --> 23:47.480
Who's the girl?
Are you a Bigfooter?

23:47.620 --> 23:51.720
That's my sister Judy,
who doesn't believe in Bigfoot.

23:54.230 --> 23:55.090
Seriously?

23:55.230 --> 23:59.290
Mega-total super seriously.

24:12.410 --> 24:13.570
Uh-oh.

24:16.480 --> 24:18.640
Show her, Zeke.
Show her the proof.

24:19.250 --> 24:21.520
Do you think she can handle...

24:21.660 --> 24:22.710
...the cave?

24:23.660 --> 24:24.780
The what?

24:24.930 --> 24:26.650
Bigfoot lives.
Bigfoot lives.

24:32.500 --> 24:33.590
Ow!

24:42.280 --> 24:43.670
Welcome to the headquarters

24:43.810 --> 24:47.410
of the Bigfoot Believers Association.

24:50.580 --> 24:52.280
Wow.

24:53.790 --> 24:56.880
- You finished it! It's great.
- Thanks.

24:57.020 --> 24:59.890
What is this, a clubhouse for bats?

25:00.030 --> 25:01.650
Observe.

25:03.260 --> 25:05.390
Yeti from the Himalayas.
Sasquatch...

25:05.530 --> 25:08.300
- Sasquatch!
- ... man-beast of the great Northwest.

25:08.440 --> 25:10.840
Momo along the mighty Mississippi.

25:10.970 --> 25:13.460
In the outback of Australia, he's Bunyip.

25:13.610 --> 25:16.240
Call him what you will,
one fact is clear:

25:16.380 --> 25:18.470
Bigfoot lives.

25:18.610 --> 25:20.340
Is this cool or what?

25:20.480 --> 25:24.010
In 1978, Appleston Morris
captured definitive proof

25:24.150 --> 25:28.090
that the subgenus Gigantopithecus
thrives in the modern era.

25:28.220 --> 25:29.550
That's his face.

25:29.690 --> 25:31.090
Check that out.

25:31.220 --> 25:33.660
Bigfoot, no longerjust for scientists.

25:33.790 --> 25:37.250
This is why they call it the Bigfoot.
You see what I'm saying?

25:37.400 --> 25:41.160
This is like size 44 for a man.

25:41.300 --> 25:43.670
Now see it?
And I got that photograph right there.

25:43.800 --> 25:46.030
Right there?
Y'all see it right there?

25:46.170 --> 25:47.260
We've been meeting here for a year,

25:47.410 --> 25:51.670
ever since this guy up north spotted
Bigfoot, and caught it on camera.

25:54.150 --> 25:58.210
Since then, we've been tracking down
Bigfoot's every move.

26:00.320 --> 26:03.050
He is definitely headed our way.

26:04.060 --> 26:05.890
And now for the proof.

26:06.760 --> 26:09.920
I keep it in cold storage.

26:10.060 --> 26:13.360
Cold storage?
Hey, do you know a Mr. Todd?

26:13.500 --> 26:15.200
Nope. Never heard of him.

26:16.270 --> 26:20.400
And now,
prepare to have your mind blown.

26:21.340 --> 26:24.540
A rare certified photo of Bigfoot.

26:24.680 --> 26:27.240
- Look, but don't touch.
Seriously?

26:27.380 --> 26:30.650
- That's a guy in a sweater.
You're nuts.

26:30.780 --> 26:34.880
- That is Bigfoot!
- Agreed.

26:35.020 --> 26:37.620
If you need more proof,
come to one of our meetings.

26:37.760 --> 26:38.780
Tuesdays at six.

26:39.560 --> 26:42.120
Can't. I'm busy on Tuesdays.

26:42.260 --> 26:45.160
From now until always.

26:45.300 --> 26:48.100
Come on, Stink.
It's pizza time.

26:48.770 --> 26:52.360
She'll be back.

26:55.340 --> 26:57.830
She'll be back.

26:58.110 --> 27:00.740
Well, I didn't know what
the backyard was missing until I saw it.

27:00.880 --> 27:03.910
It's Morocco in Virginia.
- She really doesn't travel light.

27:04.050 --> 27:05.850
- Mm-mm. Right.
- But she travels with lights.

27:05.990 --> 27:07.680
I hope you guys
saved room for my dessert!

27:07.820 --> 27:10.590
Oh, wow.
Redecorated the patio and dessert.

27:10.720 --> 27:13.190
Opal, you spoil us!

27:13.330 --> 27:14.350
Hey, Stink.

27:14.490 --> 27:15.930
Oh, honey, don't read at the table.
It's rude.

27:16.060 --> 27:17.530
I know, but look at this.

27:17.660 --> 27:20.900
Page 87. Bigfoot's bed.

27:21.030 --> 27:23.870
See, he stomps down on all the grass.

27:24.000 --> 27:27.630
Tah-dah! Tangerine fondue!

27:27.770 --> 27:30.940
- Do you remember this?
- Uh-huh. You know...

27:31.080 --> 27:32.100
Yeah.

27:32.250 --> 27:34.680
We're gonna...
We're gonna finish packing, so...

27:34.810 --> 27:36.300
- Yeah.
- But thank you.

27:36.450 --> 27:38.250
Enjoy, though, guys.

27:39.290 --> 27:41.120
Hot dogs for dessert?

27:41.250 --> 27:43.550
Yeah. I used to make this
for your dad when we were kids.

27:43.690 --> 27:45.490
Are those Froot Loops?

27:45.630 --> 27:48.990
Yeah. Dig in! Mmm.

27:49.800 --> 27:53.130
- That doesn't count.
- But it's so oogley boogley!

27:53.270 --> 27:56.290
This is nothing. When I was in Bali,
I ate grilled cockroaches.

27:56.440 --> 27:58.700
Ooh. Gross.

27:58.840 --> 28:01.240
I'll tell you what. If you take a bite,
you can be in my club,

28:01.370 --> 28:03.470
the I Ate Something Gross Club.

28:03.610 --> 28:05.200
A club? Rare!

28:05.350 --> 28:06.870
Just one bite and we're in?

28:07.010 --> 28:08.740
- Yeah.
- Pass the hot dogs!

28:08.880 --> 28:11.720
OK, one, two, three.

28:17.060 --> 28:19.360
- Mmmm.
- Mmmm.

28:19.490 --> 28:21.690
What do you think?
- This is good!

28:21.830 --> 28:23.160
Needs more Froot Loops.

28:23.300 --> 28:25.860
Triple high five, you guys.

28:26.000 --> 28:28.020
- Club members! United!
- All right!

28:30.570 --> 28:33.560
So after the Peace Corps,
I trekked across the Sahara,

28:33.710 --> 28:36.180
and then I went
to the Kunstschule in Berlin

28:36.310 --> 28:40.250
and I did all this really
cool underground art stuff.

28:40.380 --> 28:43.540
And then I moved to Bali,
which is so beautiful

28:43.680 --> 28:46.020
and I lived there until
about a month ago.

28:46.150 --> 28:47.920
Mega-cool.

28:48.050 --> 28:50.180
Is that where belly dancing's from?

28:50.320 --> 28:52.950
It's Bali, not belly, silly.
It's an island.

28:54.860 --> 28:56.490
That tickles!

28:58.160 --> 29:01.070
So do you have any fun summer plans
I should know about?

29:01.200 --> 29:03.530
Well, I was gonna have the best summer
ever,

29:03.670 --> 29:04.970
but my friends ruined it.

29:05.110 --> 29:06.940
I hate when that happens.

29:07.070 --> 29:10.910
Seriously. We were gonna do all
these dares and get Thrill Points.

29:11.040 --> 29:13.810
But they left, so no dares.

29:13.950 --> 29:15.880
I love dares.
When I was in Kenya,

29:16.020 --> 29:18.710
somebody once dared me
to ride in an ostrich race.

29:18.850 --> 29:22.220
My ostrich won, but I fell off
at the starting line.

29:22.360 --> 29:23.580
You know what, Aunt Opal?

29:25.020 --> 29:26.580
You just gave me an idea.

29:26.730 --> 29:30.390
I mean, what if we still did the dare chart
but made it a race?

29:30.530 --> 29:33.430
Me, Rocky, Amy and Frank?

29:33.570 --> 29:36.470
We could each do our own dares
and keep track of our points!

29:36.600 --> 29:38.260
First one to get to a hundred wins!

29:39.870 --> 29:40.930
Whoa!

29:41.070 --> 29:43.600
Aunt Opal!

29:43.740 --> 29:45.900
Whoa! Oh!

29:50.880 --> 29:52.110
Oh, no.

30:06.600 --> 30:09.930
- What is going on?
- Shh! You'll wake Opal!

30:20.310 --> 30:22.680
She slept through that?

30:25.120 --> 30:25.980
Weird.

30:26.120 --> 30:28.490
I know, right?

30:28.620 --> 30:30.280
Hey, did you know that Bigfoot's
only scared of two...

30:30.420 --> 30:31.950
Enough already with the Bigfeet!

30:32.090 --> 30:34.250
You don't wanna hear?
Guinea pigs and...

30:43.600 --> 30:46.970
"Dear Amy and Rocky,
uber-rare idea.

30:47.110 --> 30:50.300
Let's do a dare race,
starting right now.

30:50.440 --> 30:53.340
First one to get to a hundred points wins!

30:53.480 --> 30:55.210
What do ya say?"

30:58.720 --> 31:02.380
And the winner is Judy Moody!

31:03.720 --> 31:04.850
It's from Rocky!

31:04.990 --> 31:07.360
A dare race? I am in.

31:07.490 --> 31:09.860
Check out
what I did today!

31:10.000 --> 31:14.490
That's ten Thrill Points
for sure, don't you think?

31:14.630 --> 31:17.330
Just you wait, Rocky Zang.

31:17.470 --> 31:20.270
Just you wait.

31:23.380 --> 31:24.400
Bye.
I'm gonna

31:24.540 --> 31:25.170
miss you, buddy.

31:25.310 --> 31:27.040
I'm sorry to go.
I love you.

31:27.180 --> 31:29.580
Can you bring us back
some California bubble gum?

31:29.720 --> 31:31.010
Ah, better yet,
how about I chew some

31:31.150 --> 31:32.950
and I'll stick it on
the wall in your honor.

31:33.090 --> 31:34.680
Can we have candy for breakfast?
No. No.

31:34.820 --> 31:36.910
Have fun in California!
Listen.

31:37.060 --> 31:40.550
No for breakfast.
Can I not take a shower?

31:40.690 --> 31:44.530
Yes, you have to take
a shower. I love you, buddy.

31:44.660 --> 31:47.190
Bye! Bye!

31:52.110 --> 31:54.370
OK, synchronize watches.

31:54.510 --> 31:58.410
As of 2:12pm,
Tuesday, July 7th,

31:58.540 --> 32:01.070
the thrill race is on!

32:02.680 --> 32:04.950
So what's the first dare?
Scream Monster?

32:05.080 --> 32:06.280
Nope.

32:09.190 --> 32:10.210
This.

32:12.530 --> 32:14.720
We're gonna dress in leotards?

32:14.860 --> 32:17.920
No. Don't you see?
He's walking on a rope.

32:18.060 --> 32:19.550
A tightrope?

32:19.700 --> 32:21.830
Above the ground?

32:21.970 --> 32:23.660
Death-defying.

32:23.800 --> 32:26.430
Oh, yeah.

32:28.710 --> 32:30.570
Where do we get a tightrope?

32:35.280 --> 32:36.810
Perfecto!

32:40.150 --> 32:41.280
What do you think you're doing?

32:41.420 --> 32:43.250
I'm building
a trap for Bigfoot.

32:45.060 --> 32:46.650
I'm gonna lure him here
with peanut butter.

32:46.790 --> 32:49.790
He loves peanut butter.
That's on page 52.

32:49.930 --> 32:51.420
And then boom!

32:51.560 --> 32:54.620
A net will fall out of this tree
and land on his head!

32:54.770 --> 32:57.930
Not out of this tree.
It's mine. I called it.

32:58.070 --> 33:00.670
- You can't call a tree.
- Really? Watch me.

33:00.810 --> 33:03.040
- Mine.
- Mine.

33:03.180 --> 33:04.700
- Mine.
- Mine!

33:04.840 --> 33:07.870
- Mine! Mine! Mine!
- Mine! Mine!

33:08.010 --> 33:10.040
Guys, stop it!

33:10.180 --> 33:13.380
Let go! Let go!

33:14.950 --> 33:16.790
Ice cream!

33:16.920 --> 33:19.050
I scream! You scream!

33:19.190 --> 33:22.160
We all scream
for Old King Kold's ice cream!

33:22.300 --> 33:24.160
Yay! It's mine! It's mine!

33:24.300 --> 33:26.860
Frank?
Where are you going?

33:27.000 --> 33:28.660
To go get ice cream.

33:28.800 --> 33:30.860
But now's our chance,
before Stink gets back!

33:31.000 --> 33:32.900
Come on!
What's more important?

33:33.040 --> 33:36.030
Thrill Points or ice cream?

33:38.540 --> 33:40.010
OK, all right.

33:55.230 --> 33:57.030
- Thank you.
- Certainly.

34:04.900 --> 34:07.670
And now, the high-flying,

34:07.810 --> 34:10.780
death-defying Judy-a-rini

34:10.909 --> 34:13.040
will cross...

34:13.179 --> 34:15.010
...um...

34:16.350 --> 34:18.150
...Niagara Falls!

34:22.020 --> 34:26.420
One slip and she'll fall to her doom!

34:26.560 --> 34:29.360
Rocky's only crossed
a dinky grass field,

34:29.500 --> 34:33.590
but Judy is crossing
the crashing cataracts of Niagara!

34:40.469 --> 34:42.409
Whoa!

34:42.540 --> 34:43.909
- My goodness!
Don't worry!

34:44.040 --> 34:48.449
The great Judy-a-rini will not fall!

34:48.580 --> 34:50.639
Whoa! Whoa!

34:50.780 --> 34:53.219
Get off, Frank!
One at a time!

34:53.350 --> 34:55.580
Hurry up then!
I wanna go get ice cream!

34:57.890 --> 35:00.150
Ten Thrill Points.
Ten Thrill Points.

35:00.290 --> 35:02.630
Ten Thrill Points...

35:02.760 --> 35:05.890
Mosquitoes!
Incoming! Whoa!

35:06.030 --> 35:08.330
Stop wobbling me!

35:08.470 --> 35:11.270
I can't help it!
There's a mosquito on my...

35:27.120 --> 35:28.990
Ha-ha, you missed it.

35:29.120 --> 35:30.380
I got fuzzy navel.

35:42.840 --> 35:46.330
Hey, Judy,
ready for the Scream Monster?

35:47.570 --> 35:48.440
Hey, Judy!

35:48.570 --> 35:51.510
What's all this pink stuff?

35:51.640 --> 35:53.910
My prom dress. I have
to take it to the cleaners.

35:55.310 --> 35:57.040
So first we go
on the Tilt-a-Whirl.

35:57.180 --> 35:58.780
After we get ice cream.

35:58.920 --> 36:00.610
Right. And sno-cones.

36:00.750 --> 36:03.120
And corndogs.
And gobs of gum.

36:03.260 --> 36:06.590
Rare! We'll be ready
for the Scream Monster, for sure.

36:10.930 --> 36:12.900
Stop!

36:14.300 --> 36:15.890
Are you thinking
what I'm thinking?

36:16.040 --> 36:17.800
# You'll see me
at the mall #

36:17.940 --> 36:19.840
# The pool,
the park and by the sea ##

36:19.970 --> 36:20.960
Mr. Todd!

36:29.320 --> 36:30.940
Mr. Todd?

36:33.650 --> 36:35.350
I was sure he'd be in there.

36:35.490 --> 36:38.750
Don't worry. We'll find him.
We have all summer.

36:38.890 --> 36:41.160
- Yeah.
- Scream Monster!

36:44.700 --> 36:47.830
Supercalifragilistic-
expithrilladelic!

36:47.970 --> 36:49.260
Geez, Louise!

36:49.400 --> 36:51.460
How many Thrill Points
is that?

36:52.810 --> 36:55.570
Ten. Plus Bonus Points
for no hands.

36:59.310 --> 37:00.610
No food on the ride, kid.

37:00.750 --> 37:03.610
What? I'm not throwing
all this out!

37:03.750 --> 37:05.580
Then step outta line.

37:07.650 --> 37:10.180
Frank! We've been waiting
in line forever!

37:10.320 --> 37:13.020
Surrender the sno-cone!

37:13.160 --> 37:14.590
But it's so good.

37:14.730 --> 37:17.560
Seriously! We gotta start
earning some Thrill Points

37:17.700 --> 37:19.790
because so far we have zero.

37:19.930 --> 37:21.830
You guys coming
or going here?

37:23.040 --> 37:24.760
OK.

37:26.870 --> 37:28.070
Frank?

37:38.750 --> 37:40.580
Frank!

37:46.790 --> 37:50.020
- This is it!
- Thrill Points, here we come!

37:53.270 --> 37:55.200
Hands up!
Every second counts!

38:02.380 --> 38:04.840
I'm... not so sure about this.

38:04.980 --> 38:06.640
What's wrong?

38:09.220 --> 38:10.740
Don't you dare!

38:29.600 --> 38:31.090
We now send you
out to Tammy

38:31.240 --> 38:33.540
with this special
Bigfoot report. Tammy?

38:33.670 --> 38:35.330
With one sighting
at the pier,

38:35.470 --> 38:37.030
one at Colonial College

38:37.180 --> 38:39.370
one on Main Street,
and one at Frog Lake,

38:39.510 --> 38:41.040
that makes
five local sightings.

38:41.180 --> 38:42.340
Five!

38:42.480 --> 38:44.450
With me here
is Herb Birnbaum,

38:44.580 --> 38:46.550
and he claims that Bigfoot
was in his yard.

38:46.690 --> 38:47.980
Herb?

38:48.120 --> 38:49.610
Herb, show us
what you've got.

38:49.760 --> 38:51.280
You see that?

38:51.420 --> 38:53.220
He ripped the lid
right off that can

38:53.360 --> 38:55.790
and went straight
for the peanut butter!

38:55.930 --> 38:57.990
But couldn't
that be a raccoon?

38:58.130 --> 39:01.790
Well, yeah,
but it could also be Bigfoot!

39:01.930 --> 39:04.160
But it could also be Bigfoot!

39:04.300 --> 39:06.790
Rose Birnbaum, Herb's wife.

39:06.940 --> 39:09.410
This is Tammy,
reporting live from...

39:12.380 --> 39:14.240
Whoa.
What happened to you?

39:14.380 --> 39:16.870
Don't ask.

39:17.020 --> 39:18.750
Seriously.

39:18.880 --> 39:21.280
Don't ask.

39:27.690 --> 39:29.820
I told you not to ask!

39:29.960 --> 39:32.430
I'm not asking.
I'm telling you.

39:32.570 --> 39:36.160
- Telling me what?
- You got a postcard from Rocky.

39:36.300 --> 39:37.930
Really? Can you read it?

39:38.070 --> 39:39.540
Sure.

39:39.670 --> 39:42.040
"Dear Judy, how are you?

39:42.170 --> 39:43.510
I am fine. "

39:43.640 --> 39:45.440
Can you read it
like a normal person?

39:45.580 --> 39:47.570
You don't want me
to sound like Rocky?

39:47.710 --> 39:51.380
- Just read it, OK?
- OK.

39:51.520 --> 39:53.920
"Dear Judy, how are you?
I am fine.

39:54.050 --> 39:55.420
- Guess what?
Guess what?

39:55.550 --> 39:57.950
I just learned
how to saw someone in half!"

39:58.090 --> 39:59.920
No fair! I want to do that!

40:00.060 --> 40:01.920
We even get to be
in a real circus.

40:02.060 --> 40:04.790
"You have to come, OK?
August 4th. "

40:04.930 --> 40:09.700
Just so you know,
I'm up to 37 Thrill Points!

40:09.840 --> 40:11.100
How many do you have?

40:11.240 --> 40:14.870
Please welcome
Rocky the Magnificent,

40:15.010 --> 40:18.370
who is merely
the assistant to Judy,

40:18.510 --> 40:22.950
the Even More Magnificent!

40:23.080 --> 40:25.240
And now...

40:25.380 --> 40:27.110
...let's watch the master

40:27.250 --> 40:28.220
...at work.

40:30.060 --> 40:33.120
I warned you not
to throw up on me.

40:33.260 --> 40:35.120
Can you put me
back together later?

40:35.260 --> 40:36.890
I think so.

40:37.030 --> 40:41.930
- What did you say?
- I said, I think so.

40:42.070 --> 40:43.860
You think so what?

40:45.440 --> 40:46.960
Nothing! Never mind!

40:47.110 --> 40:48.800
Hey, you wanna go
to my Bigfoot meeting?

40:48.940 --> 40:50.640
It starts in 15 minutes.

40:50.780 --> 40:54.230
Stink, I told you
a bazillion trillion times,

40:54.380 --> 40:56.280
Bigfoot is for bozos!

40:56.420 --> 40:59.350
OK. Just don't be asking
for my autograph

40:59.490 --> 41:01.510
when I catch him
and get all famous.

41:09.600 --> 41:11.120
Hmm. Let's see.

41:11.260 --> 41:14.030
Ten points for riding
the Scream Monster.

41:14.170 --> 41:16.860
Minus five for blue throw-up,

41:17.000 --> 41:20.370
and five
for prom dress equals...

41:21.810 --> 41:23.430
You're right, Mouse.

41:23.580 --> 41:26.600
A big fat donut.

41:27.810 --> 41:28.910
Holy macaroni!

41:32.420 --> 41:34.180
Whoa!
What's all that?

41:34.320 --> 41:37.190
Hey. OK, I can't tell
if this should be a hat,

41:37.320 --> 41:39.480
or a wheel, or...

41:39.630 --> 41:41.220
...a shield.

41:41.360 --> 41:43.490
Um...

41:43.630 --> 41:45.290
I think it's the lid
to the garbage can.

41:45.430 --> 41:48.420
Yeah, I know,
but what is it really?

41:56.110 --> 41:57.670
Wow.

41:57.810 --> 41:59.570
What is all this, anyway?

41:59.710 --> 42:01.770
It's my traveling art studio.

42:01.910 --> 42:03.440
Wow.

42:04.280 --> 42:05.150
Cool.

42:05.280 --> 42:06.840
You really are an artist.

42:06.990 --> 42:09.980
Yeah.
I'm a guerrilla artist.

42:10.120 --> 42:11.560
Gorilla?

42:11.690 --> 42:13.250
As in monkey?

42:13.390 --> 42:17.020
No, as in under the radar.

42:17.160 --> 42:19.430
A guerrilla artist
makes art out of everything,

42:19.570 --> 42:20.860
and puts it everywhere.

42:21.000 --> 42:22.090
Why?

42:22.230 --> 42:24.570
'Cause it's fun.

42:24.700 --> 42:26.400
And it's daring.

42:26.540 --> 42:28.700
I have an idea.

42:36.650 --> 42:38.780
Ta-da!

42:38.920 --> 42:41.050
Wow, I love it!
I told you it was a hat.

42:41.190 --> 42:42.880
That looks great!

42:43.020 --> 42:46.860
Look, we're beautifying the
world with our amazing art!

42:46.990 --> 42:48.760
- Great!
- Now all we have to do

42:48.890 --> 42:50.950
is sneak over to the library
late at night

42:51.100 --> 42:53.290
and put our hats
on the lions.

42:53.430 --> 42:54.520
Rare!

42:54.670 --> 42:56.460
That's ten Thrill Points
for sure!

42:56.600 --> 42:58.870
Guess what!
Zeke gave me homework.

42:59.000 --> 43:01.100
He said to look for
Bigfoot scat!

43:01.240 --> 43:03.210
Scat: Noun.

43:03.340 --> 43:05.310
Scientific term
for animal droppings,

43:05.440 --> 43:07.970
also known as poop,
dung or doodoo.

43:08.110 --> 43:09.980
But that's not
its only meaning.

43:10.120 --> 43:12.380
Are you sure
he wasn't telling you to scat?

43:12.520 --> 43:14.320
Scat: Verb.

43:14.450 --> 43:16.920
Slang term meaning to exit,
scram or go away.

43:17.060 --> 43:18.390
Gotcha, Stink.

43:18.520 --> 43:21.720
Judy. Ice cream!

43:24.460 --> 43:25.930
Wait! Help! Stop!

43:26.070 --> 43:27.730
Hey, my hand is stuck!

43:27.870 --> 43:29.960
My hand is glued
to the table!

43:30.100 --> 43:31.400
Yeah, help!

43:31.540 --> 43:33.000
- OK, I'll be right back.
- Stinker!

43:33.140 --> 43:35.830
Buy me an ice cream!
Please?

43:35.980 --> 43:38.310
I'm coming to save you.

43:38.440 --> 43:41.610
This won't take long.
I hope.

43:55.560 --> 43:59.620
OK, this spatula
is our last hope.

43:59.770 --> 44:02.700
- Want some?
- An ABS?

44:02.840 --> 44:04.600
Already Been Slobbered?

44:04.740 --> 44:05.900
No, thanks.

44:07.270 --> 44:08.760
It's gonna be OK.

44:08.910 --> 44:11.500
OK, more leverage.

44:11.640 --> 44:13.670
Hang in there.

44:18.520 --> 44:19.420
More pressure.

44:19.550 --> 44:22.380
Almost!

44:24.460 --> 44:25.890
Almost...

44:26.030 --> 44:27.460
Almost...

44:27.590 --> 44:29.890
Free! Free!

44:30.030 --> 44:31.020
Free at last!

44:31.160 --> 44:35.400
In only an hour
and 17 minutes

44:35.530 --> 44:36.970
and 45 seconds.

44:37.100 --> 44:40.470
This was
the worst day of my life.

44:40.610 --> 44:42.800
I'm sorry.
I'll do anything you want.

44:42.940 --> 44:44.470
Anything to make it
up to you.

44:44.610 --> 44:46.310
- Anything?
- Mm-hm.

44:46.450 --> 44:49.810
Well, tomorrow night, there's
a Cemetery Creep 'n Crawl.

44:49.950 --> 44:51.970
Can we go?

44:52.120 --> 44:54.280
I don't know.

44:54.420 --> 44:55.550
Is it worth
Thrill Points?

44:55.690 --> 44:57.210
Yes.

44:57.360 --> 44:59.220
Then totally. Absolutely.

44:59.360 --> 45:00.920
Yes, yes, yes!

45:05.700 --> 45:09.100
Where should I put
the scat in, Opal?

45:09.230 --> 45:10.390
Fridge or freezer?

45:10.540 --> 45:11.730
Whatever.

45:11.870 --> 45:13.430
It's your animal poop.

45:13.570 --> 45:15.340
OK. I think freezer.

45:15.470 --> 45:17.240
Hey, Judy,
we're gonna leave at seven,

45:17.380 --> 45:19.110
and then we're gonna eat
our picnic at the cemetery.

45:19.240 --> 45:20.440
- What do you think?
- Yeah!

45:20.580 --> 45:22.170
Extra points for eating
with skeletons!

45:22.310 --> 45:25.180
And I need 'em, 'cause Amy
just swam with sharks!

45:25.320 --> 45:27.180
Lemme see, lemme see!

45:28.350 --> 45:30.510
Whoa.

45:30.660 --> 45:33.780
Wow, swimming with a shark.
That's cool.

45:39.260 --> 45:42.700
You're gonna
lose this race so bad.

45:42.840 --> 45:44.530
Hey, look,
your ring is green!

45:44.670 --> 45:46.570
Green with envy!

45:46.710 --> 45:49.470
Green like pond scum!
Green like boogers!

45:49.610 --> 45:53.370
Stink, you're
an intergalactic booger.

45:55.510 --> 45:57.610
Hey, where are you going?

45:57.750 --> 45:59.450
To the cemetery.
We're walking, right?

45:59.590 --> 46:02.880
It's miles from here.
We have to take Humphrey.

46:03.020 --> 46:04.110
Who's Humphrey?

46:04.260 --> 46:05.780
That's what our dad
calls our car.

46:05.920 --> 46:09.330
No way! You know, your dad had a bike
named Humphrey when we were kids.

46:09.460 --> 46:10.790
Let's take bikes!

46:10.930 --> 46:12.660
Not allowed after dark.

46:12.800 --> 46:14.230
Oh.

46:14.370 --> 46:16.270
Bummer.

46:17.540 --> 46:19.560
Let's do this!

46:24.480 --> 46:26.100
Oh!

46:26.250 --> 46:27.440
OK.

46:27.580 --> 46:31.280
Steering wheel, gas, brakes.

46:31.420 --> 46:32.350
Ignition.

46:32.480 --> 46:33.450
Frog.

46:33.590 --> 46:35.280
You know how
to drive, right?

46:35.420 --> 46:37.250
Of course.

46:37.390 --> 46:39.880
I drove across
the Horn of Africa.

46:45.960 --> 46:47.120
Watch out!

46:49.900 --> 46:52.770
That was ten years ago.
I'm sorry.

46:54.140 --> 46:56.470
R is for reverse.

46:56.610 --> 46:58.580
Got it now.

47:04.980 --> 47:08.210
- Whoa!
- You call that driving?

47:08.350 --> 47:11.020
No worries.
It'll come back to me.

47:16.030 --> 47:17.550
Is there a map or something?

47:17.700 --> 47:20.220
'Cause I have no idea
where I'm going.

47:20.370 --> 47:21.830
Got one.

47:32.010 --> 47:33.340
Ha-ha!

47:33.480 --> 47:35.570
Jessica Finch?

47:35.710 --> 47:38.980
Can you get a ticket
for driving too slow?

47:39.120 --> 47:41.810
All right, backseat driver.

47:53.200 --> 47:55.330
Watch out!
You're gonna hit the...

47:55.470 --> 47:56.870
...bouncy castle!

48:00.070 --> 48:01.330
Holy... crap!

48:01.470 --> 48:04.370
You said crap!
Crap is a swear!

48:04.510 --> 48:05.980
Crap is not a swear.

48:14.420 --> 48:15.850
Yes!

48:15.990 --> 48:19.360
Sorry, little man!

48:39.850 --> 48:43.140
And we are out of gas.

48:43.280 --> 48:48.620
And way super lost.

48:50.090 --> 48:51.390
Are we still in Virginia?

48:51.520 --> 48:54.420
Of course we are.
Look, it's Larkspur Pier.

48:54.560 --> 48:56.890
It's Virginia's number one
tourist attraction.

48:57.030 --> 48:59.220
Whoa.

48:59.360 --> 49:03.360
Looks more like Virginia's
number one ghost town.

49:06.740 --> 49:09.400
Can we eat? I'm starving.

49:13.610 --> 49:14.940
Isn't it cool, Judy?

49:15.080 --> 49:17.570
Wow, we're in the Un Zone!

49:17.720 --> 49:20.780
How cool is that?
The Un Zone. Get it?

49:20.920 --> 49:22.980
- It's cool.
- That's so funny.

49:23.120 --> 49:24.990
Look, I have baloney for you.

49:25.120 --> 49:26.950
And turkey for Stink.

49:28.760 --> 49:30.420
Yummy, yummy.

49:30.560 --> 49:31.720
Delicious sandwich.

49:33.930 --> 49:35.830
- Ooh, I brought ketchup.
- Oh, yes.

49:35.970 --> 49:37.230
I remembered
the ketchup for you.

49:44.140 --> 49:47.340
This smells funny.
Almost like...

49:47.480 --> 49:49.570
Oh, look, a seagull.

49:53.220 --> 49:55.280
I like seagulls.

49:55.420 --> 49:57.320
- Bon appétit!
- Bon what?

49:59.690 --> 50:03.150
- Oogley boogley!
- Ooh, what is that?

50:03.300 --> 50:04.890
It's scat! Doodoo!
Dung! Poop!

50:06.630 --> 50:09.000
- Disgusting!
- Gross, gross!

50:10.800 --> 50:12.740
- Crap!
- That too.

50:12.870 --> 50:15.200
Eww.

50:15.470 --> 50:17.810
"Dear Rocky,

50:17.940 --> 50:21.470
Have you ever been
on a poop picnic?

50:21.610 --> 50:25.170
I have and it stinks on ice!

50:25.320 --> 50:26.940
Hardee-har-har!"

50:27.090 --> 50:30.650
Be quiet, you guys!
I can't hear myself write!

50:30.790 --> 50:32.420
Sorry!

50:32.560 --> 50:35.690
So, the right is the gas,
the left is the brake.

50:35.830 --> 50:36.890
- Mmm.
- OK?

50:37.030 --> 50:38.890
OK. Vroom!

50:39.030 --> 50:40.590
Not that fast!
Gentle, gentle.

50:42.830 --> 50:45.700
"So what else stinks
about this summer?"

50:45.840 --> 50:48.740
Let's see.

50:48.870 --> 50:51.040
"'Surf a wave' sounds thrilladelic. "

50:51.180 --> 50:52.770
Great! Good job.

50:52.910 --> 50:56.870
"Just never try it with
Mr. Sponge Frank Squarebottom. "

51:05.190 --> 51:06.620
- All right, Judy, ready?
- Ready!

51:06.760 --> 51:09.120
- Frank, you ready?
- Ready, Frank?

51:09.260 --> 51:12.490
Look out for the wave!

51:20.040 --> 51:22.940
- Come back, Frank!
- No!

51:23.080 --> 51:24.370
Come back!

51:30.850 --> 51:33.550
"And remember
Mr. Todd's challenge?

51:33.690 --> 51:35.080
Find him and get a prize?

51:37.120 --> 51:38.750
I got a prize, all right. "

51:38.890 --> 51:40.080
Mr. Todd!

51:40.230 --> 51:42.090
"The cuckoo-head prize.

51:42.230 --> 51:47.220
And Amy can't stop sending
mega-thrill pics from Borneo.

51:56.370 --> 51:58.370
If you ever go to ride
an elephant, Rocky,

51:58.510 --> 51:59.640
be careful. "

51:59.780 --> 52:02.770
"Ride an elephant,
today only. "

52:14.090 --> 52:15.680
Sorry.

52:15.830 --> 52:19.230
"With my luck, you end up
giving the elephant a ride.

52:24.000 --> 52:27.170
So Mr. Todd is supposed to be
somewhere cold, right?"

52:28.310 --> 52:30.430
Mr. Todd?

52:32.610 --> 52:35.880
"Well, he isn't working
in the bakery freezer,

52:36.010 --> 52:38.780
that's for sure.

52:38.920 --> 52:40.780
And he wasn't at the mall,

52:40.920 --> 52:43.650
the pool, the park,
or by the sea.

52:43.790 --> 52:47.780
Mr. Todd is nowhere.
You and Amy aren't even here

52:47.930 --> 52:50.330
and you'll probably
find him before me.

52:50.460 --> 52:53.730
I'm so desperado
for Thrill Points,

52:53.870 --> 52:57.460
Aunt Opal tried to help me
put hats on the lions at the library,

52:57.600 --> 52:59.300
but we missed the bus.

53:00.710 --> 53:03.300
At the worst possible time.

53:06.110 --> 53:10.480
And all we got were Un-Points.

53:12.780 --> 53:16.190
Aunt Opal says,
"When all else fails, dance. "

53:28.700 --> 53:32.530
So I tried to make that
into a Thrill Point game.

53:32.670 --> 53:36.070
I love dancing, so that'd
be easy peasy, right?

53:44.320 --> 53:46.050
Wrong. "

53:46.180 --> 53:47.580
You lose Thrill Points.

53:59.460 --> 54:01.230
Freeze!

54:01.370 --> 54:04.060
- Whoa!
- "I lost every round.

54:19.020 --> 54:20.540
And how many Thrill Points
do I have

54:20.690 --> 54:22.710
after one whole summer
of trying?

54:22.850 --> 54:25.320
Nada, zip, zero,
zilch points.

54:25.460 --> 54:29.390
So, Rocky, can you please
think up more dares for me?

54:29.530 --> 54:34.430
'Cause otherwise I'm gonna be
a no-point, dare-doing loser!"

54:36.770 --> 54:38.740
Hey, Judy,
Frank's here!

54:38.870 --> 54:39.730
Coming!

54:39.870 --> 54:41.740
Hey, Judy!

54:41.870 --> 54:44.100
Ready for the evil creature
double feature?

54:44.240 --> 54:46.300
- Yup.
- Me, too. Let's go.

54:46.440 --> 54:48.640
Who are you?

54:48.780 --> 54:52.880
- Bride of Frankenstein.
- And I'm Frankenstein.

54:54.990 --> 54:57.980
We even have
matching rings.

54:58.120 --> 55:00.460
Judy and Frank,
sitting in a tree!

55:00.590 --> 55:01.750
K- I-S-S-I-N-G!

55:01.890 --> 55:03.690
Do you want me
to feed you to Jaws?

55:03.830 --> 55:07.260
- Um-um-um-um.
- Then take it back.

55:08.430 --> 55:11.030
G- N-I-S-S-I-K.

55:11.170 --> 55:12.760
Let's go.

55:12.900 --> 55:15.030
Bye, Aunt O... whoa.

55:15.170 --> 55:18.110
- Are you making pancakes?
- No way.

55:18.240 --> 55:19.900
This is plaster of Paris.

55:21.780 --> 55:25.110
Wow. Mom and Dad would freak
if they saw this mess.

55:25.250 --> 55:27.510
Oh, yeah. You should really get
out the vacuum and clean it up.

55:27.650 --> 55:31.110
I think you should get out
the fire hose. See ya.

55:31.260 --> 55:32.450
Bye. You look great.

55:32.590 --> 55:34.320
I love your costume.

55:43.170 --> 55:46.140
- Two, please.
- I want to take your money!

55:47.840 --> 55:51.370
How come you're wearing
a ski jacket? It's August.

55:51.510 --> 55:52.870
'Cause it's freezing in there.

55:53.010 --> 55:54.710
The air conditioner's
gone psycho.

55:54.850 --> 55:57.820
Did he say freezing?
As in cold?

56:00.050 --> 56:01.420
Mr. Todd?

56:09.330 --> 56:10.620
Search everywhere.

56:11.900 --> 56:12.990
Is one of you Mr. Todd?

56:14.530 --> 56:16.400
Nope and nope.

56:16.530 --> 56:20.200
Mr. Todd, is that you?
Mr. Todd?

56:20.340 --> 56:22.930
- Mr. Todd?
- Mr. Todd?

56:23.070 --> 56:26.410
I give up. Mr. Todd's
probably training penguins

56:26.540 --> 56:28.070
in the North Pole
or something.

56:28.210 --> 56:30.150
Or something.

56:41.490 --> 56:44.520
Remember, no being
a wimpburger.

56:44.660 --> 56:47.690
We have to stay to the end
if we wanna get points.

56:47.830 --> 56:49.090
Don't look at me.

56:49.230 --> 56:51.030
You're the one
who'll be screaming...

56:53.570 --> 56:55.130
Holy eyeball!

56:55.270 --> 56:57.330
Good thing
he's dead already.

57:00.040 --> 57:02.380
Watch it.

57:04.250 --> 57:07.410
It's true.
The dead are among us.

57:07.550 --> 57:10.490
They have taken over the
small town of Pittsylvania.

57:10.620 --> 57:12.890
Lock your doors.
Bolt your windows.

57:13.020 --> 57:14.890
Head for the basement.

57:15.030 --> 57:16.930
And if you don't
have a basement...

57:17.800 --> 57:18.820
...build one.

57:20.700 --> 57:22.460
Uh, you know what?
I gotta go home.

57:22.600 --> 57:23.900
I forgot to feed my goldfish.

57:24.040 --> 57:25.730
Sit down.

57:25.870 --> 57:29.810
This is our absolute last chance
to earn Thrill Points!

57:29.940 --> 57:32.470
Airhead, Frankenstein, shh!

57:40.050 --> 57:42.820
I come for dinner.
I come for you!

57:42.950 --> 57:45.920
Hungry.

57:46.060 --> 57:48.490
I hungry for you, Frank!

57:48.630 --> 57:50.120
He said my name!
He said my name!

57:50.260 --> 57:52.420
You are not leaving!

57:52.560 --> 57:54.460
Let go!

57:58.740 --> 58:01.300
You are dead,
Frank Pearl!

58:01.440 --> 58:05.470
No! Zombies are dead!
I'm going home.

58:05.610 --> 58:08.700
Great! Rocky and Amy
are breaking the record

58:08.850 --> 58:10.820
for the funnest summer ever,

58:10.950 --> 58:13.610
and I'm stuck with
Franken-screamer.

58:13.750 --> 58:15.480
Hey!

58:15.620 --> 58:18.820
Rocky and Amy wouldn't bail
after two seconds of zombies.

58:18.960 --> 58:22.020
Rocky and Amy wouldn't
knock me off a tightrope.

58:22.160 --> 58:26.220
Rocky and Amy
wouldn't puke all over me.

58:26.360 --> 58:28.490
Well, look who's talking!

58:28.630 --> 58:31.470
All your stupid points
and dares and charts!

58:31.600 --> 58:34.070
They suck the fun
out of everything!

58:34.210 --> 58:37.610
You're like a big,
wet fun sponge!

58:39.710 --> 58:41.540
Fun sponge?

58:44.220 --> 58:50.020
Well, if I'm a fun sponge,
then you're a fun mop!

59:05.340 --> 59:09.070
Uh, hold on there,
bridezilla.

59:09.210 --> 59:11.940
- Where's your ticket?
- It's inside. It's in my backpack.

59:12.080 --> 59:15.980
Sorry.
No ticket, no movie.

59:24.920 --> 59:28.020
Fun sponge, my elbow!

59:36.830 --> 59:39.100
What is that?

59:39.240 --> 59:40.640
It's Bigfoot!

59:40.770 --> 59:44.440
I'm a guerilla gorilla
artist now, huh?

59:44.580 --> 59:45.240
Check out the head!

59:45.380 --> 59:46.900
Do you wanna help?

59:47.050 --> 59:49.410
I'd love to, only I can't

59:49.550 --> 59:53.010
because I'm going to spend the rest
of this bummer summer in my room!

59:54.520 --> 59:56.150
Look out.
She's in a mood.

59:56.290 --> 59:57.980
Am not!

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:09.160
Eighty-five points already? Rocky!

01:00:22.980 --> 01:00:26.250
Judy! It's the ice cream truck.

01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:27.650
What?

01:00:42.470 --> 01:00:44.260
Come back in September.

01:00:46.670 --> 01:00:49.270
I think this is gonna be melted by then.

01:00:52.340 --> 01:00:55.110
So you wanna spend the rest
of the summer in your room?

01:00:55.250 --> 01:00:56.680
I might as well.

01:00:56.810 --> 01:01:00.410
It's already completely,
for sure ruined.

01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:06.650
Besides, Frank,

01:01:06.790 --> 01:01:09.660
my "used to be second best
friend but now he's my enemy,"

01:01:09.790 --> 01:01:11.190
called me a fun sponge.

01:01:11.330 --> 01:01:12.990
Wow. That's bad.

01:01:13.130 --> 01:01:14.720
Are you a fun sponge?

01:01:14.870 --> 01:01:16.990
No way! He's the sponge.

01:01:17.140 --> 01:01:19.570
It's his fault I can't
get any Thrill Points!

01:01:19.700 --> 01:01:21.800
Right. Thrill Points.

01:01:21.940 --> 01:01:23.570
Well, they're important.

01:01:23.710 --> 01:01:25.300
You can't have a not
bummer summer without them.

01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:28.340
Totally, duh. I mean, that's like
the number one rule of summer.

01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:30.340
We have to find a way for you
to get the Thrill Points.

01:01:30.480 --> 01:01:33.280
What about, you know, we didn't
put the hats on the lions yet.

01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:35.750
The hats got all ruined,
remember?

01:01:35.890 --> 01:01:37.720
There's gotta be
something else.

01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:40.450
It's impossible, Aunt Opal.

01:01:40.590 --> 01:01:43.650
I've already thought of
absolutely, positively everything.

01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:45.350
There's gotta be more.
Let's go on Google.

01:01:45.500 --> 01:01:46.930
Let's Google "fun. "

01:01:47.070 --> 01:01:49.190
What's that?

01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:55.740
Testing, testing.

01:01:55.870 --> 01:01:57.430
You got a close-up
of Bigfoot, right?

01:01:57.580 --> 01:01:58.870
Looks great.

01:01:59.010 --> 01:02:01.170
- And your name is?
- James Moody.

01:02:01.310 --> 01:02:03.040
But everyone calls me Stink.

01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:05.910
Stink is apparently
building a statue of Bigfoot

01:02:06.050 --> 01:02:09.250
to commemorate the monster
who may be lurking nearby

01:02:09.390 --> 01:02:12.450
according to 27 recent
eyewitness reports.

01:02:12.590 --> 01:02:14.420
Now, most people think
Bigfoot isn't real.

01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:16.050
How do you answer that?

01:02:16.190 --> 01:02:19.430
Well, people don't think
giant squids are real, either.

01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:22.590
Well, they are,
and so is Bigfoot.

01:02:22.730 --> 01:02:24.530
And I'm gonna catch him!

01:02:24.670 --> 01:02:26.530
If you do catch him,
Mr. Stink Moody,

01:02:26.670 --> 01:02:28.900
you'll be the most
famous kid in America.

01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:31.600
You'll put this town on the map!

01:03:02.410 --> 01:03:04.810
For years, people
have searched for Bigfoot

01:03:04.940 --> 01:03:07.070
but only Judy Moody could find him.

01:03:07.210 --> 01:03:09.810
How many Thrill Points
is that worth, do you think?

01:03:09.950 --> 01:03:12.640
A million. But who's counting?

01:03:15.420 --> 01:03:17.180
In honor of your
courageous actions

01:03:17.320 --> 01:03:21.280
we are renaming this town
Judy Moodyville!

01:03:21.430 --> 01:03:23.150
Come on down, Judy,

01:03:23.290 --> 01:03:25.560
and put this town on the map!

01:03:33.000 --> 01:03:35.130
Well, thank you,
Stink Moody.

01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:38.940
As your quest for Bigfoot continues,
we wish you luck.

01:03:39.080 --> 01:03:41.040
This is WH20,
broadcasting live...

01:03:41.180 --> 01:03:43.110
Don't forget me!
I'm a Bigfooter, too!

01:03:43.250 --> 01:03:44.180
You are?

01:03:44.320 --> 01:03:46.180
It's Judy Moody, with a J.

01:03:46.320 --> 01:03:48.550
And a U-D-Y. Did you get that?

01:03:48.690 --> 01:03:50.180
Uh, yeah. Uh-huh.

01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:52.380
Bye!

01:03:52.520 --> 01:03:55.190
Since when were you a Bigfooter?

01:03:55.330 --> 01:03:57.020
Since one minute ago.

01:03:57.160 --> 01:03:59.890
Listen, is Bigfoot really, truly,
for absolute positive real?

01:04:00.030 --> 01:04:02.590
Twenty-seven people can't be wrong.

01:04:03.970 --> 01:04:05.900
Then I will help you find him.

01:04:06.040 --> 01:04:08.700
Yeah! But how come?

01:04:08.840 --> 01:04:12.070
Because this is my absolute
last chance to get Thrill Points,

01:04:12.210 --> 01:04:14.910
and if we actually catch Bigfoot,

01:04:15.050 --> 01:04:16.810
- I might even win the race!
- Huh?

01:04:16.950 --> 01:04:19.850
Nothing, never mind.
Just tell me everything.

01:04:19.980 --> 01:04:21.210
Got it.

01:04:21.350 --> 01:04:22.720
And dogs always howl
whenever they see him.

01:04:22.850 --> 01:04:26.650
That's on page 37.
Zeke can tell you more.

01:04:28.160 --> 01:04:30.250
He's like a Bigfoot encyclopedia.

01:04:32.630 --> 01:04:33.860
OK, Bigfooters.

01:04:34.000 --> 01:04:36.590
Tuesday's meeting
is now called to order.

01:04:36.730 --> 01:04:38.430
- Herb and Rose?
- Present.

01:04:38.570 --> 01:04:40.060
- Stink?
- Present.

01:04:40.200 --> 01:04:42.760
- New member?
- Judy Moody. Present.

01:04:42.910 --> 01:04:45.880
Oh, she looks like a smart cookie.

01:04:46.010 --> 01:04:47.380
Where is everyone?

01:04:47.510 --> 01:04:49.380
This is it.
This is our club.

01:04:49.510 --> 01:04:51.710
- And we welcome you.
- Get a picture of that.

01:04:52.750 --> 01:04:54.550
Better late than never.

01:04:54.690 --> 01:04:56.590
- Rose? Do you have a report?
- Three new sightings!

01:04:56.720 --> 01:04:58.590
That's the most we've
gotten in one week.

01:04:58.720 --> 01:05:00.120
Excellent! Give me the coordinates.

01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:03.460
One saw Bigfoot taking laundry
off her clothesline.

01:05:03.590 --> 01:05:08.030
57 Ashbury Road.
It's a mile east of the mall.

01:05:08.170 --> 01:05:09.630
Gotcha.

01:05:09.770 --> 01:05:14.570
Another saw something large
and furry at the dump.

01:05:14.710 --> 01:05:20.440
The third swears he saw Bigfoot last night
at the corner of Croaker and Jefferson.

01:05:20.580 --> 01:05:21.940
Croaker and Jefferson?

01:05:22.080 --> 01:05:23.440
That's where we live!

01:05:23.580 --> 01:05:24.880
- You live there?
- Yeah.

01:05:25.020 --> 01:05:28.040
- Did anybody say anything?
- 117 Croaker.

01:05:28.190 --> 01:05:31.520
This calls for an all-night surveillance!

01:05:31.660 --> 01:05:34.120
- Are you guys up for it?
- You mean like a stake-out,

01:05:34.260 --> 01:05:36.920
with flashlights and secret codes and stuff?

01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:39.620
- I got a whole book of codes.
- All right! Yes!

01:05:39.760 --> 01:05:40.990
Thrill-o-rama!

01:05:41.130 --> 01:05:43.500
Herb, Rose, you're in charge of equipment.

01:05:43.630 --> 01:05:47.730
Troops, we've got everything you need.
Camouflage netting.

01:05:47.870 --> 01:05:49.000
- Check.
- Check.

01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:51.170
- Night-vision goggles.
Check.

01:05:51.310 --> 01:05:53.780
- Camcorder with whistle.
Check.

01:05:53.910 --> 01:05:56.000
- Check, check.
- Thermoses with coffee.

01:05:56.150 --> 01:05:59.450
Herb, they don't drink coffee.

01:06:00.220 --> 01:06:01.340
Good luck, team.

01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:05.950
- I will call with any sighting updates.
- Sir.

01:06:06.660 --> 01:06:08.750
OK, that's the lot of it.

01:06:08.890 --> 01:06:14.660
Now remember, if you need back-up,
this van is at your service.

01:06:15.300 --> 01:06:18.530
August 3rd, 8:06pm.

01:06:18.670 --> 01:06:19.970
The trap is set,

01:06:20.100 --> 01:06:22.600
and the Bigfoot stake-out is on.

01:06:22.740 --> 01:06:26.770
This is Stink Moody,
reporting live.

01:06:26.910 --> 01:06:29.780
You look like Owl Girl!

01:06:29.910 --> 01:06:32.280
These don't work. I can't even see.

01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:34.280
That's because
it's not dark yet.

01:06:35.250 --> 01:06:36.650
- Oh.
Hey.

01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:40.950
Are you ready?
Let's go over the plan.

01:06:41.090 --> 01:06:42.460
You two will sleep in the tent.

01:06:42.590 --> 01:06:44.560
- Check.
- If you see or hear anything,

01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:47.430
you will contact me immediately
on this walkie-talkie.

01:06:47.570 --> 01:06:49.470
That's Stink's old baby monitor.

01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:52.800
Whatevs. Let's call it the walkie-talkie.
What is the signal?

01:06:52.940 --> 01:06:54.460
Code Red! Code Red!

01:06:54.610 --> 01:06:56.300
Awesome.

01:06:56.440 --> 01:06:58.970
What happens if you fall asleep
and Bigfoot attacks us,

01:06:59.110 --> 01:07:00.910
and we're half-eaten
before you get downstairs?

01:07:01.050 --> 01:07:02.510
He won't attack us.

01:07:02.650 --> 01:07:07.140
I know Bigfoot sign language.
This means, "I am your friend. "

01:07:07.280 --> 01:07:10.520
And this means,
"Your head was delicious. "

01:07:10.650 --> 01:07:12.710
OK, Bigfoot's not gonna
eat any heads, all right?

01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:14.550
Because we're
remembering this vow:

01:07:14.690 --> 01:07:15.680
We will not...

01:07:15.830 --> 01:07:17.090
Fall asleep!

01:07:36.680 --> 01:07:37.700
Stink, wake up!

01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:41.680
Code Red. Code Red.

01:07:41.820 --> 01:07:44.650
Aunt Opal, Code Red! Code Red!

01:07:46.490 --> 01:07:47.480
Geez, Louise!

01:07:53.530 --> 01:07:57.020
Holy macaroni! It's... It's him!

01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:05.540
Gotcha!

01:08:09.710 --> 01:08:14.120
Bigfoot! Code Red! Code Red!

01:08:14.750 --> 01:08:16.220
Help.

01:08:22.560 --> 01:08:24.790
- Frank?
- Judy?

01:08:24.930 --> 01:08:26.590
What are you doing here?

01:08:26.729 --> 01:08:29.100
Well, I got my dad
to go back to the theater

01:08:29.229 --> 01:08:31.200
and pick up our packs,
and I thought I could just

01:08:31.340 --> 01:08:34.200
drop it off in your tent
or something so you'd find it,

01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:37.640
only I bumped into a jar
and then you hair-netted me!

01:08:37.779 --> 01:08:40.740
Sorry. I thought you were Bigfoot.

01:08:41.810 --> 01:08:43.680
Why would I be Bigfoot?

01:08:43.810 --> 01:08:47.149
You scared
Judy's pants off, Frank!

01:08:47.279 --> 01:08:49.779
- Did not.
- You were screaming your head off.

01:08:49.920 --> 01:08:52.859
No, I wasn't. I was...

01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:00.790
Bigfoot?

01:09:00.930 --> 01:09:05.029
- Bigfoot.
- Impossible. That was an owl.

01:09:07.939 --> 01:09:09.430
That was an owl.

01:09:09.569 --> 01:09:11.970
Or Bigfoot pretending to be
an owl! Come on, let's go!

01:09:12.109 --> 01:09:14.130
I have to get my camcorder!

01:09:14.750 --> 01:09:17.479
Are you coming, Frank?
It's worth mega-mega-points!

01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:19.410
Um, I'd love to,

01:09:19.550 --> 01:09:21.350
but, um...

01:09:21.490 --> 01:09:23.890
Oh, that's my dad. Gotta go! Bye!

01:09:24.020 --> 01:09:25.649
Set for night vision!

01:09:43.270 --> 01:09:46.180
Maybe it really was an owl.

01:09:46.310 --> 01:09:49.680
Nuh-uh. That was him.

01:09:49.810 --> 01:09:52.080
Bigfoot is famous
for his owl sounds.

01:09:52.220 --> 01:09:53.380
Page 11.

01:09:59.290 --> 01:10:01.380
You go first. I'll hold the light.

01:10:01.530 --> 01:10:03.520
You go first. I'm filming.

01:10:03.660 --> 01:10:06.390
OK, scaredy pants.
But stay close.

01:10:06.530 --> 01:10:08.930
Not that close.

01:10:09.070 --> 01:10:12.330
Then go faster.
No way.

01:10:52.410 --> 01:10:54.270
What was that?

01:10:56.410 --> 01:10:58.850
Shh.

01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:10.520
Stop. Look. There!

01:11:11.900 --> 01:11:16.920
- Is that some kind of bed?
- Yeah, a Bigfoot bed.

01:11:17.070 --> 01:11:20.970
Remember from the picture?
This must be where he sleeps.

01:11:21.110 --> 01:11:24.800
Then where is he?

01:11:27.810 --> 01:11:29.280
He must've heard us coming.

01:11:31.480 --> 01:11:34.750
He's probably watching us. Mr. Bigfoot?

01:11:34.890 --> 01:11:38.080
We come in peace!

01:11:39.160 --> 01:11:40.890
Hello?

01:11:42.390 --> 01:11:44.050
Can you hear me?

01:12:34.450 --> 01:12:36.940
There! See?
That's his bed!

01:12:38.220 --> 01:12:41.210
Whoa. Do you really think it's his?

01:12:41.350 --> 01:12:45.350
He was there. I know it.

01:12:45.490 --> 01:12:47.550
All I know is I got
a face full of possum

01:12:47.690 --> 01:12:48.920
and zero Thrill Points.

01:12:49.060 --> 01:12:51.320
Don't give up. You can do it.

01:12:51.460 --> 01:12:53.120
It can take years
to catch a monster.

01:12:53.260 --> 01:12:55.460
But I don't have years.
I need Thrill Points now.

01:12:56.830 --> 01:12:58.890
Look! Look, it's Bigfoot!

01:12:59.040 --> 01:13:00.260
Look, there are the dogs!

01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:02.170
Quick! After him!

01:13:06.640 --> 01:13:09.170
There! After him, go! Go, go!

01:13:12.720 --> 01:13:14.120
Whoa! Don't stop!

01:13:14.250 --> 01:13:16.880
- Go! Go! Go!
- Come on! Come on!

01:13:20.660 --> 01:13:22.960
We have to catch him before
he gets to Main Street!

01:13:23.090 --> 01:13:24.920
The cars
will drive him cuckoo!

01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:26.530
Page 73!

01:13:30.770 --> 01:13:33.000
- Did you see that?
- He's hijacking the ice cream truck!

01:13:33.140 --> 01:13:34.370
We'll never catch him now.

01:13:38.940 --> 01:13:40.270
Stop!

01:13:40.410 --> 01:13:42.070
I'm sorry, but I'm afraid
we need this bike...

01:13:42.210 --> 01:13:43.800
- Jessica.
... Jessica.

01:13:43.950 --> 01:13:46.580
This is a matter of extreme
national emergency.

01:13:47.850 --> 01:13:51.220
- Who are you?
- I am Opal,

01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:53.790
the special agent in charge
of the apprehension

01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:55.590
of large unidentified creatures.

01:13:55.730 --> 01:13:58.390
We are requisitioning
all available bicycles.

01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:01.990
Thank you for your service to your country.

01:14:02.130 --> 01:14:04.100
Watch out for the!

01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:07.770
Get it off, get it off!
I can't see anything!

01:14:07.910 --> 01:14:10.310
Sorry!

01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:13.410
Get it off! I don't like this!
I'm gonna fall off!

01:14:13.540 --> 01:14:15.070
I can't hang on! Take it off!

01:14:18.980 --> 01:14:21.420
Oh, I can see!
- Look, the ice cream truck!

01:14:31.330 --> 01:14:34.790
Stop!

01:14:36.170 --> 01:14:38.730
Bigfoot, come back!

01:14:45.410 --> 01:14:46.570
Now what?

01:14:49.280 --> 01:14:51.180
Hey, we just got a report!
Bigfoot's in...

01:14:51.320 --> 01:14:53.840
- The ice cream truck. We know!
- Get in!

01:14:55.290 --> 01:14:56.620
Buckle up, everybody.

01:14:56.750 --> 01:14:58.380
- Should I drive?
No!

01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:10.730
This is Herb Birnbaum reporting a large
runaway man-gorilla known as Bigfoot

01:15:10.870 --> 01:15:13.360
who appears to have
commandeered an ice cream truck.

01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:15.200
- Left! Turn left!
- Go left, Rose!

01:15:16.440 --> 01:15:17.960
Faster!

01:15:18.110 --> 01:15:20.630
I have to tell you, this is
my first official car chase.

01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:23.510
Really? We get in two
or three of these a week.

01:15:23.650 --> 01:15:24.640
Hit it! Hit it!

01:15:25.850 --> 01:15:27.250
Hang on, everybody.

01:15:27.380 --> 01:15:30.250
Commencing infrared
warning device!

01:15:30.390 --> 01:15:32.690
Is that legal?

01:15:32.820 --> 01:15:35.920
When you're chasing a man-gorilla,
son, anything is legal.

01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:37.650
Anything!

01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:40.960
Whoa!
Whoa!

01:15:42.370 --> 01:15:44.890
It's a cloaking device! Like the movies!

01:15:49.140 --> 01:15:50.500
Windshield wipers!

01:15:50.640 --> 01:15:52.610
Go, go, go!

01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:56.440
Oh! Wait till you see my
supersonic tracking device.

01:15:56.580 --> 01:15:58.550
That's really like the movies.

01:16:00.920 --> 01:16:05.080
Wow, that's cool!
You, sir, are an artist.

01:16:05.220 --> 01:16:09.020
I programmed it with 200
different Bigfoot sounds.

01:16:09.160 --> 01:16:10.850
The minute it picks up
the slightest...

01:16:15.200 --> 01:16:17.190
Herb, I told you
to use a lag bolt!

01:16:17.330 --> 01:16:19.700
All right.
Look out!

01:16:23.170 --> 01:16:25.110
- That's the news van!
- That interviewed me!

01:16:25.240 --> 01:16:26.370
Follow that news!

01:16:58.880 --> 01:17:01.640
Look out! Watch out! Watch out!

01:17:03.310 --> 01:17:04.440
Outta the way! Outta the way!

01:17:14.060 --> 01:17:15.220
There!

01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:22.690
Hey, look!
It's the poop picnic place!

01:17:22.830 --> 01:17:24.300
Hey, kids, wait! Wait!

01:17:24.430 --> 01:17:25.920
You'll need a protective suit!

01:17:28.140 --> 01:17:29.660
Shh.

01:17:38.850 --> 01:17:40.180
- Mr. Todd?
Judy!

01:17:40.320 --> 01:17:42.840
Long time no see!
What's going on?

01:17:42.990 --> 01:17:44.540
- We were saving you from...
- Bigfoot!

01:17:44.690 --> 01:17:47.890
Get back! Get back!

01:17:48.030 --> 01:17:49.080
Bigfoot.

01:17:50.190 --> 01:17:51.960
Whoa.

01:17:56.700 --> 01:17:58.630
Zeke?!
I don't believe this!

01:17:58.770 --> 01:18:00.500
We received at least
76 calls this morning!

01:18:00.640 --> 01:18:02.630
It's my teacher!
It's Zeke!

01:18:02.770 --> 01:18:05.500
- I can't believe he's the ice cream guy!
- Since when are you Bigfoot?

01:18:05.640 --> 01:18:07.230
- Why didn't you stop for us?
- Well, when?

01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:09.940
A madcap ride through town
has led us to this pier.

01:18:10.080 --> 01:18:11.450
Hey, I love your cool suit.
You look awesome.

01:18:11.580 --> 01:18:12.570
Thanks.

01:18:12.720 --> 01:18:14.810
- I'm Mr. Todd, Judy's teacher.
- Hi, I'm Opal.

01:18:14.950 --> 01:18:17.390
And this is Bigfoot. I hired him
to help me sell ice cream.

01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:20.650
With all the Bigfoot mania around here,
he'll really help me drum up business.

01:18:20.790 --> 01:18:22.990
He's way better than
the arrow-pointing guy.

01:18:23.130 --> 01:18:25.360
Why didn't you tell me
that you knew Mr. Todd?

01:18:25.500 --> 01:18:27.430
- I've been looking for him all summer.
- Yeah.

01:18:27.560 --> 01:18:31.760
Dudes, chill. I only met
the Toddster this morning.

01:18:31.900 --> 01:18:33.890
Yet there are two questions
that still remain:

01:18:34.500 --> 01:18:36.800
Is the real Bigfoot still at large?

01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:40.000
And will he show up for the circus?

01:18:40.680 --> 01:18:44.040
- The circus?
- Yup. It's today, right here at the pier.

01:18:44.180 --> 01:18:48.380
And remember,
you get a prize if you find me.

01:18:48.520 --> 01:18:50.150
Front row seats!

01:18:50.290 --> 01:18:53.190
Wow, thanks! Are we
the first ones to find you?

01:18:54.290 --> 01:18:55.350
Not exactly.

01:19:20.050 --> 01:19:22.750
Thanks for getting me
a ticket to the circus.

01:19:22.890 --> 01:19:26.010
Yeah, sure. Sorry
I was such a fun mop.

01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:27.420
Sponge.

01:19:27.560 --> 01:19:29.890
Whatever. Want some?

01:19:30.030 --> 01:19:32.290
Bigfoot loves cotton candy.

01:19:35.200 --> 01:19:37.030
Look!

01:19:46.380 --> 01:19:48.400
Hey, it's Rocky!

01:19:48.550 --> 01:19:51.240
And he's sweeping elephant poop!
I knew it!

01:19:51.380 --> 01:19:53.780
Hey, Rocky! Hey!

01:19:54.850 --> 01:19:57.050
Hey!
- Hey, Judy!

01:19:57.190 --> 01:20:00.280
Ladies and gentlemen!

01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:04.090
Welcome to the Zangzini Family Circus!

01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:09.460
Let the show begin!

01:20:14.170 --> 01:20:17.300
Do we have a volunteer
from the audience?

01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:22.280
Someone brave enough
to get sawed in half?

01:20:22.410 --> 01:20:23.670
Me, me, me!

01:20:23.810 --> 01:20:25.180
Hmmm.

01:20:25.320 --> 01:20:29.050
Pick Judy!
Pick me, me!

01:20:29.190 --> 01:20:32.120
Pick the girl
in the green.

01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:36.830
You, young lady!

01:20:38.130 --> 01:20:40.390
- Hey, Judy.
- Hey, Rocky!

01:20:40.530 --> 01:20:43.560
Ooh, I missed you so much.

01:20:43.700 --> 01:20:46.400
I missed you, too. Hop in.

01:21:08.760 --> 01:21:10.120
Watch this.

01:21:15.530 --> 01:21:16.590
Ta-da!

01:21:16.730 --> 01:21:19.500
Wow, Rock!
Judy, that is uber-cool!

01:21:19.640 --> 01:21:21.130
OK, could you put her back
together now, please?

01:21:21.270 --> 01:21:22.570
Yeah, 'cause we
only just got home,

01:21:22.710 --> 01:21:24.940
and we'd like our little girl
in one piece.

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:27.840
Don't worry, Mom.
It really didn't hurt that much.

01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:35.740
Can we try, Judy?

01:21:35.890 --> 01:21:37.410
"We"? You try it!

01:21:37.550 --> 01:21:38.710
Frank!

01:21:38.860 --> 01:21:40.120
Can I borrow Judy tonight?

01:21:51.130 --> 01:21:53.800
They're way too serious. Don't you think?

01:21:58.280 --> 01:21:59.870
Ta-da!

01:22:00.010 --> 01:22:03.410
- You fixed them!
- Yup.

01:22:04.710 --> 01:22:06.270
Wow!

01:22:14.930 --> 01:22:16.260
Yay!

01:22:16.390 --> 01:22:19.520
We did it! We did it!

01:22:22.570 --> 01:22:24.430
Yay!

01:22:24.570 --> 01:22:26.470
Oh, I'm so happy!

01:22:26.600 --> 01:22:28.660
Aren't you glad you didn't spend
the rest of your summer in your room?

01:22:28.810 --> 01:22:30.640
Oh, for sure
and absolute positive.

01:22:30.770 --> 01:22:34.010
I wouldn't have put a hat
on a lion or gone on a stake-out

01:22:34.140 --> 01:22:36.940
- or fallen off a tightrope.
- Or had a poop picnic.

01:22:37.080 --> 01:22:39.610
Or found Mr. Todd.

01:22:39.750 --> 01:22:41.770
Or been in a car chase.

01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:43.180
Or gotten sawed in half.

01:22:43.320 --> 01:22:45.910
Or met you.

01:22:46.060 --> 01:22:49.460
Hey, I've got an idea. How about
you don't leave tomorrow?

01:22:49.590 --> 01:22:51.320
How about you come
live with us?

01:22:51.460 --> 01:22:54.520
Oh.

01:22:56.070 --> 01:22:57.560
What about this:

01:22:57.700 --> 01:22:59.100
Next summer, I'm thinking of

01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:02.640
wrapping the Eiffel Tower
in 10,000 scarves.

01:23:02.770 --> 01:23:05.500
- Do you wanna help me?
- For real?

01:23:05.640 --> 01:23:07.610
That would be
on-top-of-spaghetti rare!

01:23:07.740 --> 01:23:11.010
I never thought we could
top this summer, but Paris?

01:23:11.150 --> 01:23:12.670
Wow!

01:23:14.320 --> 01:23:16.550
Paris. Next summer.
Be there! I love you!

01:23:16.690 --> 01:23:18.680
Bye!
Love you back!

01:23:18.820 --> 01:23:19.790
Bye!

01:23:19.920 --> 01:23:21.480
See you next summer!

01:23:21.620 --> 01:23:25.060
Goodbye, Judy!
Bye, Stink! This was the best!

01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:26.220
Bye!

01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:27.990
I love you!

01:23:42.380 --> 01:23:45.310
Fifty cents to touch Bigfoot!

01:23:45.450 --> 01:23:48.650
Fifty cents to touch this?
Are you nuts, Stink?

01:23:48.790 --> 01:23:51.190
Do you have change for a dollar?

01:23:52.390 --> 01:23:54.190
Yes! Sure.

01:23:58.090 --> 01:24:02.360
- Hey, thanks for fixing my bike.
- Yeah, sure, no problem.

01:24:05.440 --> 01:24:08.730
Eww.

01:24:12.410 --> 01:24:14.140
Awesome!

01:24:16.510 --> 01:24:18.540
Fifty cents
to touch Bigfoot!

01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:20.880
Hey! This was my idea.

01:24:21.020 --> 01:24:23.210
Aunt Opal says
art belongs to everyone.

01:24:23.350 --> 01:24:26.350
Besides, I have to earn money
for the Eiffel Tower!

01:24:26.490 --> 01:24:27.890
Fifty cents a touch!

01:24:28.020 --> 01:24:30.620
For a dollar,
Bigfoot will shake your hand!

01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:33.590
Or better yet, for a hundred dollars
we'll move him to your yard!

01:24:33.730 --> 01:24:37.390
For a thousand dollars,
I'll tell you where the real Bigfoot lives!

01:24:51.410 --> 01:24:53.970
Don't do that.

01:24:54.120 --> 01:24:55.710
That's not in the script.

01:25:14.770 --> 01:25:15.830
Mom! Whoa!

01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:11.520
Just wait a sec.

01:26:18.670 --> 01:26:20.900
- OK, OK.
- Cut.
