WEBVTT

00:17.851 --> 00:19.091
In Ohio...

00:25.359 --> 00:26.729
A desperate call...

00:31.698 --> 00:34.568
Every second
she’s in the water
she’s in more danger.

00:38.071 --> 00:39.341
This car’s going to sink.

00:46.513 --> 00:48.153
Then, in Florida...

00:50.884 --> 00:52.124
A wanted criminal...

00:53.921 --> 00:55.021
The chase is on.

00:55.055 --> 00:56.085
...a rookie cop...

00:57.925 --> 01:00.335
Am I going to freeze
and not know what to do?

01:03.597 --> 01:06.167
And an ending
no one sees coming.

01:06.199 --> 01:09.639
We don’t ever expect it to go
as badly as this one.

01:27.487 --> 01:28.457
In Ohio...

01:30.123 --> 01:32.563
sixty miles south
of Lake Erie,

01:32.593 --> 01:34.193
is the city of Alliance.

02:39.092 --> 02:41.632
Both officer Tussey
and I were dispatched to it.

02:41.662 --> 02:44.402
Um, he went one way
I went another way.

02:44.431 --> 02:47.331
So, if there’s traffic
at least one of us
can get there.

02:48.168 --> 02:50.168
So, he came in
from the east side,

02:50.203 --> 02:52.413
and I came in
from the west side.

02:52.439 --> 02:54.709
And emergency calls
are different,

02:54.741 --> 02:57.811
’cause you do have
a heighten sense when
it’s an emergency call.

02:59.146 --> 03:01.946
I wouldn’t say I was close,
by any means.

03:01.982 --> 03:04.222
So, timing was definitely
of the essence.

03:04.751 --> 03:05.851
That river’s deep.

04:40.647 --> 04:41.677
I’m so sorry.

05:05.305 --> 05:06.565
I’m moving
to the back of the car.

05:41.975 --> 05:43.745
I work two jobs.

05:44.778 --> 05:47.948
I work at a nursing home
in the morning,

05:47.981 --> 05:51.281
and then I go home,
spend time with my children.

05:52.385 --> 05:55.515
And then I go
to my second job,
at a bar.

05:55.555 --> 05:59.285
And then I go home,
go to sleep, and start
the day all over again.

06:00.727 --> 06:05.667
Feel like I have to have
more than
one job to survive.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.570
I have two daughters,

06:08.602 --> 06:11.442
one is four
and one is two years old.

06:11.471 --> 06:15.011
They have brought out
the best parts of me.

06:16.509 --> 06:21.409
That night I was working...
12 plus hours.

06:21.448 --> 06:25.048
And I, uh, hadn’t gotten
much sleep the night before.

06:25.085 --> 06:28.095
Because, I was also working
the night before.

06:30.190 --> 06:31.960
I left work in Canton.

06:31.992 --> 06:35.232
And, I was taking the highway.

06:36.396 --> 06:38.966
There was bits and pieces
of the drive that...

06:39.733 --> 06:41.103
were, kind of, foggy too.

06:41.134 --> 06:43.504
Because, I was so tried,
I was in and out of it.

06:45.071 --> 06:48.041
As soon as I got off
the highway, it was
the last thing I remember.

06:50.677 --> 06:54.447
I woke up,
flying through the air.

06:54.481 --> 06:57.351
Like, I smashed my face
off of the steering wheel.

06:58.351 --> 07:00.621
I heard a loud crashing noise.

07:01.721 --> 07:02.821
And I hit the water...

07:03.790 --> 07:04.990
it was really dark.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.730
I dug around
on my floorboards.

07:08.762 --> 07:11.762
And in my purse,
and it was submerged
in water.

07:11.798 --> 07:16.398
I picked up my phone,
and thank God my phone case
was water proof.

07:16.436 --> 07:18.936
Because, my phone
wouldn’t have worked.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.919
My car just shut down.

07:30.951 --> 07:32.621
There was no
unlocking the door,

07:32.652 --> 07:36.262
there was no
rolling the windows down,
there was no starting it.

07:36.289 --> 07:38.259
Like, it completely...

07:38.959 --> 07:40.189
wiped everything out.

07:40.226 --> 07:41.426
Like, there was nothing
that I could
have done.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.801
And the window was cracked,
enough for me to breathe,

07:43.830 --> 07:46.200
but not enough
for me to crawl out of.

07:46.232 --> 07:47.132
It was crazy.

07:54.174 --> 07:55.744
I tried kicking the window.

07:57.010 --> 08:00.580
Every time I kicked it,
the car sunk harder
and faster.

08:06.853 --> 08:10.463
I stood on my seat
and crouched down
so that way I was,

08:10.490 --> 08:12.290
you know,
high above the water.

08:20.133 --> 08:21.533
And then I seen lights.

08:21.568 --> 08:25.068
And as soon as I seen the,
you know, red and blue lights,

08:25.105 --> 08:26.875
I...

08:26.906 --> 08:29.136
kind of gotten
a little bit of relief.

08:29.175 --> 08:30.935
But, my car
was filling with water.

08:42.288 --> 08:45.418
The water level
was up to my neck.

08:45.458 --> 08:50.298
And I had already accepted
the fact that, you know,
I might die.

08:50.330 --> 08:53.300
I might drown.
They might not
get to me in time.

08:56.770 --> 08:58.940
I was the first one on scene.

08:58.972 --> 09:03.012
I started to look
for a vehicle
on the side of the road,

09:03.043 --> 09:05.383
or some type of skid marks.

09:05.412 --> 09:07.852
Some kind of guidance
to where it might be.

09:11.518 --> 09:13.388
Officer Tussey
had arrived on scene,

09:13.420 --> 09:16.160
and he was able
to see the car
out in the river.

09:18.691 --> 09:22.531
I stopped just at
where the van
left the roadway.

09:22.562 --> 09:25.632
My light, quickly,
reflected off of the van.

09:25.665 --> 09:30.095
So, it didn’t take that long.
I just started going down
towards the water.

09:31.638 --> 09:33.438
Never did I expect

09:33.473 --> 09:38.183
to see a vehicle
in the middle of the water,
floating.

09:38.211 --> 09:41.111
And being familiar
with how wide that river is,

09:41.147 --> 09:43.677
and how deep it was,
and the cold.

09:43.716 --> 09:46.346
I knew time
was a serious factor.

09:47.520 --> 09:49.990
It’s going through my mind
that, we have second.

09:50.023 --> 09:52.193
We don’t have minutes.
We have seconds.

09:59.632 --> 10:01.672
Uh, the embankment
was very steep.

10:01.701 --> 10:03.271
Um, full of...

10:04.604 --> 10:08.644
busted up cement blocks,
tree limbs and roots.

10:18.485 --> 10:19.795
I knew I was going in there.

10:19.819 --> 10:23.789
It wasn’t a question of,
can we figure out
another strategy.

10:24.724 --> 10:26.364
Somebody was going
into that water.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.433
Officer Tussey, he went in.

10:36.402 --> 10:38.572
The water is extremely cold.

10:38.605 --> 10:41.915
Almost instant, my legs
started going numb,
it was that cold.

10:41.941 --> 10:46.181
And I...
You know, with Tussey,
clear up to his neck.

10:46.212 --> 10:48.582
It’s an extremely
dangerous situation.

10:49.315 --> 10:50.975
She was against her window,

10:51.017 --> 10:56.217
and I saw her face,
and I recognized her as,
Mrs. Alexus Carver.

10:57.056 --> 10:58.916
I knew she had children.

10:58.958 --> 11:01.228
I did not know if the children
where in there at the time.

11:01.928 --> 11:04.328
That was very alarming.

11:04.364 --> 11:07.874
My heart, you could say,
picked up a couple beats
per second.

11:09.536 --> 11:10.866
This car’s going to sink.

11:12.071 --> 11:14.171
If we lose this car...

11:14.207 --> 11:15.407
and there’s kids in it.

11:17.210 --> 11:20.280
Um, I’m gone too.
’Cause I’ll do what I can.

11:24.250 --> 11:25.250
So...

11:27.487 --> 11:30.117
Yes, what goes through my head
was the kids.

11:30.156 --> 11:32.926
And the possibility
of losing somebody
that needed my help.

11:57.817 --> 11:58.817
I can’t breathe.

12:04.123 --> 12:07.963
Up until this point,
I didn’t have to think,
it was just actions.

12:07.994 --> 12:10.664
Get down the hill,
get in the water,
open the door.

12:10.697 --> 12:11.797
That was very easy.

12:13.099 --> 12:16.369
Once I had the obstacle
of the doors don’t open,

12:16.402 --> 12:17.902
and the windows
don’t roll down.

12:17.937 --> 12:19.137
I realized...

12:19.706 --> 12:20.866
I’m very cold.

12:20.907 --> 12:22.267
I’m beyond cold.

12:26.913 --> 12:29.553
It felt like my chest
was caving in,

12:29.582 --> 12:30.882
like I was in a vice.

12:30.917 --> 12:33.587
Every breath I would
take in felt like...

12:34.854 --> 12:36.424
I just couldn’t
breathe at all.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.256
-Shatter it, please!

12:43.029 --> 12:43.959
I can’t!

12:52.272 --> 12:56.212
I felt the van move,
slightly, when I was
holding on to it.

12:56.242 --> 13:01.852
The front window was starting
to become submerged,
or go under water.

13:01.881 --> 13:04.721
If we couldn’t
get that door open,
that window open,

13:04.751 --> 13:09.191
she was absolutely,
100% going to go
under that water.

13:14.260 --> 13:17.800
I felt the Tussey
was battling, number on,
he couldn’t get to her.

13:17.830 --> 13:21.170
Number two,
he couldn’t breathe,
he felt he couldn’t breathe.

13:21.200 --> 13:26.110
And, I needed to talk to him
and reassure him.

13:26.139 --> 13:29.509
We are here, we are fine,
we are going to do this.

13:29.542 --> 13:31.182
Even though, inside,

13:31.210 --> 13:35.250
I myself
was starting to panic,
we’re not going to get there.

13:43.623 --> 13:46.033
I could barely
touch his fingertips.

13:46.059 --> 13:47.589
So I didn’t feel

13:47.627 --> 13:51.997
that I was 100% able
to help him,

13:52.031 --> 13:53.831
physically, if he needed me.

13:53.866 --> 13:56.366
So I had to
go in the water
with Officer Tussey.

13:57.637 --> 14:00.667
My foot slides down in between
chunks of concrete.

14:03.710 --> 14:06.710
I tried moving my foot,
but I couldn’t.

14:06.746 --> 14:10.846
But, my focus
turned to Officer Tussey
and Alexus, right away.

14:17.857 --> 14:20.587
The shock
of the cold water is...

14:21.494 --> 14:22.464
it’s doing a couple things.

14:22.495 --> 14:27.075
Um, it’s creating panic
on my part.

14:27.100 --> 14:31.500
I can no longer be
the levelheaded person
that I need to be.

14:31.537 --> 14:36.507
As there was a pretty severe
disconnect between
what my brain was telling me,

14:36.542 --> 14:39.612
to what I was comprehending,
to what my body was doing.

14:49.021 --> 14:50.491
You have to
shut everything out.

14:50.523 --> 14:51.463
What they call, uh...

14:52.658 --> 14:54.528
you know,
you put your blinders on.

14:54.560 --> 14:58.030
And I knew
that by him panicking,

14:58.064 --> 14:59.674
myself being stuck,

14:59.699 --> 15:03.069
and Mrs. Carver not being able
to open the door herself,

15:03.102 --> 15:04.802
none of us
where going to help
each other out.

15:05.705 --> 15:07.615
So, I tried to use my voice...

15:08.508 --> 15:11.478
to calm him down and focus.

15:11.511 --> 15:12.511
The sooner
we can get this out,

15:12.545 --> 15:13.615
the sooner we can save her,

15:13.646 --> 15:16.516
the sooner we are all
going to be okay.

15:24.757 --> 15:28.927
I had so much going on,
so much I’m trying to process.

15:28.961 --> 15:33.201
You know, if I can’t
get past whatever I was
fighting with internally,

15:33.232 --> 15:35.172
there’s no way she’s going
to get through this.

15:37.136 --> 15:40.566
But, the cold is just
making it seem like
it’s taking forever.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.266
And, timing is of the essence.

15:42.308 --> 15:46.078
Every second
that I’m in the water,
I’m in more danger.

15:46.112 --> 15:48.882
Every second
she’s in the water,
she’s in more danger.

15:48.915 --> 15:51.385
And she had been
in there, substantially,
longer than I was.

15:57.490 --> 16:00.930
Once I had the tomahawk
in my hands, it was...

16:00.960 --> 16:02.260
almost like second nature.

16:14.207 --> 16:15.007
I’m so sorry.

16:22.415 --> 16:24.255
As she came out,
the van went down.

16:27.320 --> 16:30.090
Once I got her,
I didn’t look back.

16:30.122 --> 16:32.292
I didn’t know
if somebody else
was in the car.

16:32.325 --> 16:34.335
I knew that there were
car seats in the car.

16:34.360 --> 16:35.660
Um, so, that was alarming.

16:36.963 --> 16:40.073
I hadn’t heard any kids
or heard of any kids.

16:47.707 --> 16:51.137
I was on my way
to get my children,
so my children were...

16:51.177 --> 16:53.247
10 minutes
from being in the car.

16:53.279 --> 16:56.019
And I’m very, very glad
they were not
in the car.

17:03.923 --> 17:06.993
All right, hold on.
Don’t worry about your phone.

17:07.894 --> 17:08.934
Got it?

17:21.807 --> 17:24.107
Once I got Mrs. Carver
to the bank,

17:24.143 --> 17:26.213
and made sure Tussey
was up to the bank,

17:27.146 --> 17:29.146
I could feel
my leg giving out.

17:29.181 --> 17:32.181
Like, I couldn’t feel like
I could stand anymore.

17:32.218 --> 17:33.648
And, uh...

17:33.686 --> 17:34.946
then I started
to become nervous.

17:43.596 --> 17:44.496
All right, I can stand.

17:45.598 --> 17:46.928
Another officer
that works our shift,

17:46.966 --> 17:49.326
Officer Mabley,
had come down the hill.

17:49.368 --> 17:51.638
And I’m asking him,
to help get me out,
help hold me.

17:56.375 --> 17:57.335
Oh, don’t. Don’t. No.

18:06.619 --> 18:07.649
I had no feeling.

18:07.687 --> 18:11.357
I had no feeling in my leg,
clear up to my hip.

18:11.390 --> 18:13.390
So, I did not know if...

18:13.426 --> 18:16.056
it was broke, if I’d cut it,
if it was just cold.

18:16.095 --> 18:20.925
And I couldn’t feel my foot,
where it was stuck, or my leg,
or if I was bending.

18:20.967 --> 18:23.497
But, I could feel
the pressure in my hip.

18:23.536 --> 18:26.866
Of him pulling and my foot
wasn’t coming out.

18:26.906 --> 18:28.936
I was getting to the point
where I couldn’t stand,
and I thought...

18:29.775 --> 18:31.075
I was going to
fall into the water.

18:45.491 --> 18:46.591
Oh, there we go!

19:05.378 --> 19:07.078
You know what, guys,
somebody got him.

19:09.582 --> 19:11.152
I was trying
to get Tallman
outta the rocks.

19:14.186 --> 19:15.216
Here,
hold on a second.

19:17.323 --> 19:18.093
That’ll work.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.825
Medics
are now on scene.

19:21.861 --> 19:25.001
And examine Alexus,
Tussey, and Tallman.

19:28.034 --> 19:31.574
Tussey,
has a cut on his hand
from the window glass.

19:31.604 --> 19:33.944
Otherwise,
the three are unharmed.

19:35.274 --> 19:37.844
-You need an ambulance?
-No, I’m okay.

19:37.877 --> 19:39.877
-You sure?
-Yeah. Just have to
sit here a second.

19:43.182 --> 19:44.682
This one definitely was...

19:45.751 --> 19:49.991
not only a life and death
situation for a civilian.

19:50.022 --> 19:51.522
But, I believe,

19:51.557 --> 19:54.657
it could have been
a life and death situation
for an officer as well.

19:54.694 --> 19:55.764
And I think...

19:57.430 --> 19:59.830
Many a times
I sat and thought...

20:00.399 --> 20:03.039
that one second...

20:04.070 --> 20:05.340
difference,

20:05.371 --> 20:08.111
and how many
different scenarios
could have happened,

20:08.140 --> 20:11.610
that would have changed
the entire outcome...

20:11.644 --> 20:15.154
to be far less positive
than what it was.

20:15.181 --> 20:18.421
Yes, Officer Tussey and I
went home with maybe
a couple scratches and cold.

20:18.451 --> 20:22.121
And Mrs. Carver
went home without a car.

20:22.154 --> 20:23.094
But, we all went home.

20:27.593 --> 20:31.163
I don’t think you get
any more satisfying
than that.

20:31.197 --> 20:34.367
Knowing that you job,
human life depends
on your job.

20:34.400 --> 20:35.700
And you were able to...

20:36.836 --> 20:37.766
to do that.

20:37.803 --> 20:39.243
And do that efficiently.

20:40.673 --> 20:43.783
This was a situation
that you don’t get
worse than that.

20:43.809 --> 20:45.679
But the outcome
was fantastic.

20:45.711 --> 20:48.311
You... You know,
you couldn’t script that.

20:48.347 --> 20:51.917
Um, so there... There was
a huge sense of pride.

20:54.487 --> 20:57.157
He not only saved me
but he...

20:58.424 --> 21:02.134
He brought me back home
to my children.

21:07.566 --> 21:08.996
And if he wouldn’t
have done that...

21:10.770 --> 21:12.570
...my kids wouldn’t
have a mom.

21:21.580 --> 21:22.880
And...

21:24.116 --> 21:26.616
...that whatever he’s doing
in life, he’s...

21:26.652 --> 21:28.122
He’s picked
the right profession

21:28.154 --> 21:30.794
and he’s definitely doing
a good job at it.

21:30.823 --> 21:32.663
And, um...

21:34.693 --> 21:37.833
...we need more people
like them around.

21:45.070 --> 21:49.780
In central Florida,
70 miles north of Orlando,

21:49.809 --> 21:52.079
is Marion County.

21:57.049 --> 21:59.519
New recruit, Roman West,

21:59.552 --> 22:02.752
and field training officer
Corporal Daniel Luiken,

22:02.788 --> 22:04.158
are out on patrol.

22:06.125 --> 22:09.335
I was getting ready
for field training,

22:09.361 --> 22:11.761
which takes three and a half
to four months.

22:11.797 --> 22:15.067
When Deputy West
was assigned to me,

22:15.100 --> 22:17.140
I’m trying to let him
do everything.

22:17.169 --> 22:19.139
He’s handling the calls
for service.

22:19.171 --> 22:22.041
He’s the one who’s doing
all the driving.

22:22.074 --> 22:28.014
I’m trying to get him
out there and let him know
what he can and can’t do.

22:31.450 --> 22:33.850
Between- 30
and- 00 in the morning,

22:33.886 --> 22:36.286
we get transmission
over our radio

22:36.322 --> 22:40.392
that Putnam County
is chasing
a black pickup truck

22:40.426 --> 22:43.726
into our county
and it had been heading
into our area.

23:01.881 --> 23:04.721
I’m being told
that the person stole a car,

23:04.750 --> 23:07.020
there were a firearm
in the car,

23:07.052 --> 23:09.892
and they had threatened
somebody else
with that firearm.

23:09.922 --> 23:14.462
So I’m instructing Deputy West
that we need
to get over there quickly.

23:16.762 --> 23:22.702
I know that people that run
from the police usually
don’t have much to lose.

23:25.304 --> 23:27.774
Am I going to fight and chase?

23:27.806 --> 23:30.436
Am I going to freeze
and not know what to do?

23:31.744 --> 23:33.414
I’ve been
in several pursuits

23:33.445 --> 23:35.705
where the reportee
is telling us

23:35.748 --> 23:38.048
that the suspect has a weapon
in the car.

23:38.083 --> 23:40.823
But you don’t ever
expect it to go

23:40.853 --> 23:43.093
as badly as this one did.

23:57.236 --> 23:59.866
When we get
a major call like this one,

23:59.905 --> 24:02.465
I need to step in a little bit
and make sure

24:02.508 --> 24:06.508
he’s getting directions
correctly to assist
Putnam County.

24:06.545 --> 24:09.545
So I wanted to get
to the intersection

24:09.581 --> 24:12.451
of Highway 315
and 316 before them,

24:12.484 --> 24:14.654
so that I could throw out
some stop sticks.

24:17.323 --> 24:20.263
I get on the
accelerator pretty good.
Light and sirens.

24:20.292 --> 24:22.792
We’re probably doing
90 to 100 miles a hour

24:22.828 --> 24:24.558
just to get close
to the intersection.

24:31.670 --> 24:36.110
We’re trying to catch
the vehicle as it comes
into the major intersection.

24:40.079 --> 24:44.619
I slow down to a...
Almost a dead crawl
at the intersection.

24:52.191 --> 24:55.131
Happening upon the suspect
at the same exact time.

24:57.997 --> 25:00.197
The suspect
blows the stop sign,

25:00.232 --> 25:05.202
turns hard right
heading back westbound
on the 316.

25:08.507 --> 25:11.307
I flip around right there
in the middle of the road.

25:11.343 --> 25:12.343
The chase is on.

25:18.517 --> 25:21.947
The description
that Putnam County gave me
of the vehicle was spot on.

25:21.987 --> 25:26.657
It was
a black Ford pickup truck
with some front end damage.

25:26.692 --> 25:30.602
I only had a fraction
of a second to look
at the driver.

25:30.629 --> 25:35.869
And what I saw
was a white male
with short brown hair.

25:55.187 --> 25:59.087
Soon as we initiate pursuit,
it is pedal to the metal.

26:02.561 --> 26:03.931
Sixty.

26:03.962 --> 26:07.172
Before I know it,
we’re doing 120 miles a hour

26:07.199 --> 26:11.199
westbound on a two-lane
country road.

26:12.137 --> 26:15.607
I have never driven like that
in my life

26:18.877 --> 26:22.907
By itself,
a high-speed pursuit
is really dangerous.

26:22.948 --> 26:26.218
What makes it even worse
is when you have a new guy

26:26.251 --> 26:28.321
who’s only been cop
for a month and half
in the driver’s seat.

26:29.521 --> 26:33.461
I’m in the passenger seat
watching Deputy West

26:33.492 --> 26:37.432
drive at speeds
he’s probably never driven
in his life.

26:37.463 --> 26:40.633
And I’m needing to keep
an eye on him

26:40.666 --> 26:45.836
’cause there are times
when trainees they...
They block out everything.

26:45.871 --> 26:48.911
They... They don’t hear
the instructions
from their training officer.

26:51.777 --> 26:54.707
I kind of went
in and out of tunnel vision.

26:58.317 --> 27:00.087
I would grip
the steering wheel

27:00.119 --> 27:01.949
like I was going to bend it
in half.

27:04.756 --> 27:08.226
And I had to relax,
listen to Deputy Luiken

27:08.260 --> 27:10.900
give instruction on how
to drive a patrol car.

27:23.408 --> 27:25.638
We can’t lose this car,
we need to go faster.

27:33.318 --> 27:34.648
We’re getting closer to town.

27:34.686 --> 27:38.356
So we need to get
this pursuit ended

27:38.390 --> 27:41.590
before we start getting
into areas

27:41.627 --> 27:43.597
where there are kids playing
in the front yard

27:43.629 --> 27:45.929
or there’s people walking
on the side of the road.

27:47.366 --> 27:53.096
The suspect vehicle tries
to shake Deputy Luiken
and myself

27:54.740 --> 27:57.040
He tried turning down
a road, though.

27:57.075 --> 27:59.635
When he turned
to go down this road,
he changed his mind

27:59.678 --> 28:02.008
and swerved back
onto the main road

28:02.047 --> 28:06.417
which gave us a small window
of opportunity to try
to end this pursuit.

28:10.055 --> 28:11.315
Signal four and--

28:14.526 --> 28:19.156
I attempt
a PIT maneuver on the vehicle,
just to try to disable it.

28:22.334 --> 28:25.444
And our push bumper
just bounced.

28:27.306 --> 28:30.376
...right off
the back left quarter panel
of that truck.

28:30.409 --> 28:33.849
And it’s like nothing
ever happened
to the truck at all.

28:47.159 --> 28:51.459
Suspect dips off
onto a dirt side road

28:51.496 --> 28:55.196
which is a different planet
from the paved roads
we were on.

28:58.270 --> 29:00.110
Because
I have knowledge of the area,

29:00.138 --> 29:02.268
I know that this road
is going to be ending

29:02.307 --> 29:03.707
in the next couple
hundred yards.

29:07.045 --> 29:09.445
Deputy West, however,
didn’t know that.

29:16.855 --> 29:19.385
In this situation,
we have a stolen vehicle,

29:19.424 --> 29:21.464
aggravated assault
with a firearm.

29:21.493 --> 29:24.433
That was before
we even got involved.

29:24.463 --> 29:28.003
I know there’s supposed
to be a firearm in this truck.

29:30.936 --> 29:35.266
I can hear kids playing
in the yard right next
to where I’m stopped.

29:35.307 --> 29:38.307
So now, I’m concerned
about this family.

29:38.343 --> 29:40.983
I’m yelling, "Get inside
your house now."

29:41.013 --> 29:44.453
If this person has already
threatened somebody else
with the firearm,

29:44.483 --> 29:47.423
it’s not a big step for them
to threaten other people

29:48.086 --> 29:49.746
and put other lives in danger.

30:02.934 --> 30:06.144
I’m expecting Deputy West
to be standing right next
to me

30:06.171 --> 30:08.741
on the other corner
of the bumper
and he’s not there.

30:11.476 --> 30:16.146
I hear him say,
"Stay with the vehicle."

30:17.683 --> 30:23.493
And so I stay
in the patrol car for probably
5 to 10 seconds.

30:26.958 --> 30:29.258
A little bit of panic there.

30:29.294 --> 30:32.264
So I have to get him out
of a dangerous situation.

30:34.499 --> 30:37.699
And then, I hear him say
"Get out, get out."

30:47.079 --> 30:49.179
I’m just looking
for any movement

30:49.214 --> 30:54.224
that is going to be seen
as a threat in need
of elimination.

31:12.304 --> 31:17.314
The car door on a patrol car
isn’t any different than
on a regular car.

31:17.342 --> 31:20.482
So it’s basically just
a tin can

31:20.512 --> 31:23.782
between him
and a potentially
armed subject.

31:23.815 --> 31:26.945
The ideal situation
is behind the engine block,

31:26.985 --> 31:30.285
the most bulletproof part
of a car.

31:37.662 --> 31:42.432
Almost immediately
as I peer over,
I hear one gun shot.

31:44.569 --> 31:47.569
It makes impact
somewhere near me.

31:47.606 --> 31:52.306
And it just takes a second
to kind of sink in as
to the...

31:52.344 --> 31:54.954
The gravity
of the situation.

32:02.654 --> 32:05.624
The driver door
that I’ve left open had been
struck by a bullet.

32:07.793 --> 32:10.403
Given the trajectory,
it could have hit me

32:10.429 --> 32:13.829
resulting in a...
In a fatal wound.

32:13.865 --> 32:18.435
And I chalk it up to a miracle
that it stopped it completely
dead in its tracks.

32:30.515 --> 32:31.875
It was a bit
of a confusion there

32:31.917 --> 32:35.047
because I’m being told
it’s a female driving.

32:35.086 --> 32:38.886
But what I looked at
when the truck passed me
at the intersection,

32:38.924 --> 32:40.224
looked like it was a male.

32:50.635 --> 32:54.735
So my confusion was
is there a man in the car?

32:54.773 --> 32:56.673
Is there... Is it a woman?

32:56.708 --> 32:57.708
Are there two people?

32:59.644 --> 33:04.324
If there’s two people
they can split off
and try to ambush us.

33:04.349 --> 33:07.149
So this situation
is really dangerous.

33:16.127 --> 33:18.997
Second shot went off.

33:19.030 --> 33:22.930
That tells me they definitely
don’t care about my safety
or anyone else’s safety.

33:25.904 --> 33:29.444
Taking that person
into custody is now even
more important.

33:36.181 --> 33:40.621
We maintain a position
of aggression on the car.

33:40.652 --> 33:42.252
Guns drawn.

33:44.289 --> 33:46.519
10-4. 5799.

33:51.763 --> 33:53.503
And more units
start arriving.

33:55.934 --> 33:59.204
Containment
is my top priority
at this point.

33:59.237 --> 34:02.667
And if there’s two people,
it’s harder to contain.

34:09.080 --> 34:12.980
The Marion County
helicopter is also called in
to assist.

34:17.088 --> 34:19.458
There had already been
shots fired at the police,

34:19.491 --> 34:22.061
So it kind of heightened
our awareness and...

34:22.093 --> 34:24.933
And put a little speed
in our response.

34:31.136 --> 34:32.636
Now that
we’ve got more people,

34:32.671 --> 34:35.611
we’re gonna approach
and try to clear the car.

34:44.316 --> 34:45.616
If there’s two people,

34:45.650 --> 34:49.920
that only adds
to our possibilities
of what could happen.

35:16.181 --> 35:19.481
Putnam County,
they’ve given us the name
and date of birth.

35:19.517 --> 35:22.217
So I was able to pull up
the driver’s license picture.

35:23.488 --> 35:25.288
From looking at the picture,

35:25.323 --> 35:29.993
to going back in my mind
of what the driver
was when they passed me,

35:31.096 --> 35:34.026
I’m 100% positive
that it’s our suspect.

35:34.065 --> 35:36.925
And I knew
that we were only looking
for one person.

35:38.403 --> 35:40.913
And the suspect is a woman.

35:42.841 --> 35:47.511
Corporal Luiken
confirms the suspect
is Rachel Baggs.

35:47.545 --> 35:53.675
She is already known to police
for prior charges,
including possession.

35:53.718 --> 35:56.488
There’s a little bit
of relief that there’s
only one person.

35:56.521 --> 36:02.591
But women are just as capable
of causing great harm
to other people.

36:02.627 --> 36:05.697
But we’re dealing with someone
who’s a dangerous criminal.

36:05.730 --> 36:09.030
We need to get her
under control quickly.

36:09.067 --> 36:13.667
The investigation has now
turned to where did she go?

36:20.979 --> 36:23.649
The adrenaline
is surging through you.

36:23.682 --> 36:26.882
Our suspect is still
in possession

36:26.918 --> 36:29.688
of a .45-caliber handgun

36:29.721 --> 36:33.421
that would stop any living,
breathing human

36:33.458 --> 36:35.658
dead in their tracks
with one pull of the trigger.

36:40.932 --> 36:43.772
When we get on scene,
we basically start
coordinating

36:43.802 --> 36:45.802
with the ground units
to set up a good perimeter

36:45.837 --> 36:48.107
and contain the suspect
within a certain area.

36:48.139 --> 36:51.409
We’re constantly visually
looking with our eyes

36:51.443 --> 36:55.483
and searching with the camera
to see if we can spot
the suspect.

36:55.513 --> 36:59.283
When you’re looking
from 1,500 to 2,000 feet
in the air,

36:59.317 --> 37:01.287
I feel like it’s looking
for a needle in a haystack.

37:05.824 --> 37:09.064
The longer it takes
to find someone,
the further they can go.

37:09.094 --> 37:11.704
God forbid go into a house

37:11.730 --> 37:14.900
and then it’s borderline
game over.

37:16.067 --> 37:18.567
After almost five hours
of searching,

37:18.603 --> 37:22.443
a 911 call comes
into Marion County dispatch.

38:04.849 --> 38:08.549
My immediate response
was relief that
we didn’t lose her.

38:08.586 --> 38:12.216
But then it’s quickly replaced
with concern,

38:12.257 --> 38:14.327
’cause now she’s
in someone else’s backyard.

38:32.443 --> 38:34.983
Immediately typed
in the address.

38:35.013 --> 38:37.153
Got the address
from the communications center

38:37.182 --> 38:39.122
and put the camera
on the scene.

38:51.696 --> 38:53.296
I wasn’t sure
if it was the suspect

38:53.331 --> 38:54.501
that we were looking
for or not.

39:08.213 --> 39:11.983
When we have
a dangerous criminal
on the loose like this,

39:12.016 --> 39:15.186
we’re gonna get
our SWAT team involved

39:15.220 --> 39:18.390
to quickly contain her
and get her into custody.

39:26.664 --> 39:30.274
The SWAT team
arrives at the scene
and begins their approach.

39:36.241 --> 39:38.341
When the SWAT team
is approaching her,

39:38.376 --> 39:42.246
it is nerve-wracking
but you try not
to get worked up.

39:42.280 --> 39:47.390
Ultimately, the only thing
that we can provide to people
on the ground is information.

39:53.391 --> 39:55.131
We were keeping eyes
on the suspect

39:55.159 --> 39:58.099
to make sure
that she wasn’t going
to harm the residents,

39:58.129 --> 39:59.429
or anything like that.

39:59.464 --> 40:01.474
It’s definitely tense.

40:02.166 --> 40:04.866
People are way more prone

40:04.903 --> 40:08.813
to shoot if they feel trapped,

40:08.840 --> 40:10.570
boxed in like they have
nowhere to go.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.673
Looking through the camera,
it appeared that she basically
gave up.

40:42.807 --> 40:45.807
Hiding in the woods
for several hours tends
to do that to people.

40:46.945 --> 40:48.185
It breaks people
down mentally.

40:48.212 --> 40:51.152
And then, they decide to come
and turn themselves in.

40:55.486 --> 41:00.016
Once the suspect is taken
into custody,
it’s a big relief,

41:00.058 --> 41:01.658
physically and mentally.

41:01.693 --> 41:04.063
Um, nobody else can get hurt.

41:12.403 --> 41:16.643
It’s a little bit of disbelief
on my end that this is
finally over.

41:16.674 --> 41:18.144
You wanna sit down?

41:18.176 --> 41:24.346
The suspect
is identified as 43-year-old
Rachel Baggs.

41:24.382 --> 41:27.382
She is arrested and charged
on multiple counts,

41:27.418 --> 41:32.688
including grand theft
and aggravated assault
with a deadly weapon.

41:32.724 --> 41:36.834
She is convicted and sentenced
to five years in prison.

41:43.935 --> 41:46.545
A situation of this...
This magnitude

41:46.571 --> 41:49.211
doesn’t come around
very often.

41:49.240 --> 41:51.640
I’ve been doing this job
for five and a half years.

41:51.676 --> 41:56.246
It’s the first time
and the only time
that someone’s shot at me.

41:56.280 --> 42:00.650
We wake up every morning
and we put on
our bulletproof vests.

42:00.685 --> 42:02.995
I don’t ever wanna make sure
it works.

42:05.123 --> 42:09.393
I’m thankful that Deputy West
had a good head
on his shoulder.

42:09.427 --> 42:12.097
For a trainee
who had only been
doing the job

42:12.130 --> 42:14.200
for a month and a half,
he really impressed me.

42:15.933 --> 42:21.343
After the incident,
I, without a doubt,

42:21.372 --> 42:24.212
knew that this was
the correct path for me.

42:24.242 --> 42:30.412
Every day my expectations
for this job are met,
and then some.

42:30.448 --> 42:35.248
Um, I couldn’t think
of a better job for me

42:35.286 --> 42:38.916
that I’ve ever done
or will ever do.
