- Hi.

15:48.116 --> 15:49.659
Thank you for meeting me.

15:51.369 --> 15:52.495
What is it?

15:55.665 --> 15:56.791
Ziggy...

15:58.042 --> 16:00.044
Ziggy told me this morning

16:03.381 --> 16:07.552
that apparently it was Max who choked
Amabella at orientation,

16:08.553 --> 16:11.389
and apparently it's been him who's been
bullying her all along.

16:13.724 --> 16:16.060
- What?
- Yeah.

16:16.394 --> 16:18.729
Amabella told Ziggy,
but made him promise not to tell

16:18.980 --> 16:21.315
because Max threatened to hurt her more
if it got out,

16:21.524 --> 16:23.651
so, he's just been keeping this secret.

16:25.361 --> 16:26.904
You're sure about this?

16:27.238 --> 16:31.075
I mean, I definitely considered that he could
be lying just to protect himself.

16:32.869 --> 16:37.999
And I have to face the fact that violence
could be in his DNA, given who his dad is.

16:39.750 --> 16:41.586
I think he's telling the truth.

16:42.670 --> 16:46.924
He said also that
Max pushed Skye down the stairs,

16:47.091 --> 16:48.176
um,

16:49.051 --> 16:51.262
and that he's been a little aggressive
towards her as well.

16:55.099 --> 16:57.435
I'm so sorry, Celeste, to tell you this.

16:59.687 --> 17:03.107
They're kids, though, you know.
They bully. It's human nature.

17:03.733 --> 17:05.108
They grow out of it.

17:08.945 --> 17:10.198

(CRYING)

18:24.772 --> 18:29.110
And then he said, "I'll see you tonight,"
which sounded like a threat.

18:31.028 --> 18:33.281
I seriously doubt
he's going to blow up his life.

18:39.203 --> 18:40.621
Why do you want to blow up yours?

18:48.379 --> 18:49.964
I wish I knew the answer to that.

18:53.342 --> 18:55.052
I can't really make sense of it.

18:59.140 --> 19:00.725
I think maybe

19:03.811 --> 19:09.150
sometimes I'm just holding onto this idea
of perfection so tight,

19:11.819 --> 19:13.654
that something has to give.

19:14.238 --> 19:16.240
And I can't explain it.

19:16.324 --> 19:17.742
And I won't excuse it.

19:19.493 --> 19:21.162
I've been wanting to tell Ed for so long.

19:23.414 --> 19:26.083
I just haven't found the courage

19:28.169 --> 19:29.587

19:30.087 --> 19:31.339
I decided not to go through with it.

19:37.094 --> 19:39.430
It was pointed out to me, not by Bonnie,

19:41.015 --> 19:43.100
that whatever attention I bring to the cause

19:43.225 --> 19:45.353
will be buried under the controversy
of my methodology,

19:45.436 --> 19:46.854
so I'm going to find another way.

19:49.231 --> 19:50.858
Maybe I never really wanted to do it.

19:52.360 --> 19:56.280
Maybe it was more of a publicity stunt,
you know, to raise awareness.

19:56.405 --> 19:57.698
And to piss off your mom.

20:00.034 --> 20:01.118

hadn't confronted them like that.

and do nothing.

20:17.301 --> 20:19.136
Why would you be the one to get vilified?

20:19.261 --> 20:21.305
Because I'm a working mom. I've told you.

20:21.389 --> 20:25.101
Worse, a CEO, which deems me a bitch.
You have no idea.

20:26.227 --> 20:29.980
If I get shot in the head tonight,
half these moms are going to say,

20:30.106 --> 20:32.900
"She couldn't bother herself to duck? What?

20:32.983 --> 20:36.570
"What, she couldn't get the nanny

they're vicious.

They spend their money,

20:54.630 --> 20:59.176

to even show up and invest their time?

Yes, I've been violent

I was talking to Celeste, and she told me
that it wasn't Ziggy, and I'm, uh...

44:04.644 --> 44:08.272
I'm so sorry.
I've treated you and your little boy so badly.

44:08.356 --> 44:13.152
- It's okay. It's... No apology necessary.
- Thank you.

44:13.236 --> 44:18.115
And my husband was so inappropriate
and out of line.

44:18.199 --> 44:20.535
I did try to poke your eye out, in his defense.

44:21.118 --> 44:22.787
-(CHUCKLES)
- I clearly deserved it.

44:22.870 --> 44:25.873
It takes a really big person
to apologize like that.

44:26.624 --> 44:27.959
You're a very big person.

44:36.092 --> 44:37.468
What's your name?

44:37.552 --> 44:41.055
- Sorry, just one minute, please.
- Oh, come on. Really? You serious?

44:41.180 --> 44:42.348
(LAUGHS)

44:43.474 --> 44:45.476

what a compassionate soul you are.

45:22.555 --> 45:24.515
But I was just protecting my friend.

45:25.516 --> 45:28.477
- She's just a little bit drunk.
- And I'm sorry I was so horrible.

45:53.002 --> 45:54.170
Please.

Celeste, can I talk to you?

45:56.130 --> 45:57.214
No.

45:57.381 --> 45:59.926
- Can we go back to the car and talk?
- I'm not coming back with you.

46:01.177 --> 46:02.929
- Celeste...
- No.

46:03.846 --> 46:05.306
I think she just needs a minute.

46:05.389 --> 46:08.601
I appreciate your concern,
but I'm talking to my wife, not you.

46:09.185 --> 46:11.562
Celeste, let's just go now.
We have to talk about it.

46:11.771 --> 46:14.273
CELESTE: No! I'm not coming home with you.

46:14.649 --> 46:17.485
So, just don't do this in front of everyone,
do you understand?
