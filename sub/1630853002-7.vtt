 just please calm down.

 there, is it all right?

 Each entrant may
 submit one marrow only.

02:00.040 --> 02:02.960
 Entrants must be in

02:25.600 --> 02:29.280
 No arguments, we don't want
 to repeat of last year.

 [Brutus panting]

02:33.400 --> 02:36.080
 Brutus, there you are.

02:36.160 --> 02:40.280
 The real value of today is
 not in winning or losing,

02:40.360 --> 02:43.680
 but in promoting a good old
 fashioned community spirit.

02:43.760 --> 02:47.160
 In one generation teaching
 valuable skills to the next.

02:50.880 --> 02:52.040

02:52.120 --> 02:54.400
 And with so many
 children in attendance,

02:54.480 --> 02:56.680

 for all of family.

 This is all I'm at liberty
 to say at this time.

03:52.200 --> 03:53.600
 [grunts] Well can I at
 least get a picture?

03:53.680 --> 03:55.080
 No!

03:55.160 --> 03:57.360
 Please leave, thank you.

03:59.920 --> 04:02.320
 [camera shutter clicks]

04:02.400 --> 04:03.760
 Well, he's definitely dead.

04:05.280 --> 04:06.160
 In fact,

04:09.600 --> 04:13.880
 I'd say he's positively ancient.

04:13.960 --> 04:15.240
 How ancient?

04:15.320 --> 04:16.760
 Well, that's a question
 for an archaeologist.

04:16.839 --> 04:19.000
 So not our problem then.

04:19.079 --> 04:21.240
 -[mumbles]
 -[grunts] What do you think?

04:21.320 --> 04:23.560
 We may have stumbled across
 a Viking burial ground

04:23.640 --> 04:25.000
 right here in Great Slaughter.

04:26.480 --> 04:29.160
 Old Raymond perhaps,
 even Celtic!

04:52.080 --> 04:56.200
 Who knows what treasures
 may lurk beneath this soil.

04:56.280 --> 04:57.560
 We might be standing

04:57.640 --> 04:59.920
 on a site of the most
 extraordinary scientific

05:00.000 --> 05:03.200
 and historical interest! [sighs]

05:03.280 --> 05:05.400
 -Yeah, absolutely.
 -So well and good,

05:05.480 --> 05:06.840
 but what about all marrows?

05:06.920 --> 05:09.280
 Now they been harvested
 they'll be losing water.

05:09.360 --> 05:10.880
 Could that affect their weight?

05:10.960 --> 05:13.480
 When will the scales be
 returned to the post office?

05:13.560 --> 05:15.360
 We're being sabotaged!

05:15.440 --> 05:17.440
 Winners should be
 party, but I aint.

05:17.520 --> 05:19.120
 That's right.

05:19.200 --> 05:20.560
 Get the allotments out of
 bounds until further notice.

05:20.640 --> 05:22.200
 Whatever for?

05:22.280 --> 05:24.280
 Apparently they're a site
 of archaeological interest.

05:24.360 --> 05:26.520
 We won't know until they
 ask event excavated.

05:26.600 --> 05:27.880
 Excavated?

05:27.960 --> 05:30.080
 I'd like to see you
 try dig up my plot

05:30.160 --> 05:31.400
 when with veggies there.

05:31.480 --> 05:32.960
 You surely you won't
 dig up the entire site

05:33.040 --> 05:35.440
 for the sake of some old
 bones and bits broken pottery?

05:35.520 --> 05:36.960
 Okay, just to be
 clear, this isn't me,

05:37.040 --> 05:38.360
 this is the archaeologist.

05:38.440 --> 05:39.680
 But this is outrageous,
 I won't stand for it.

05:39.760 --> 05:40.520
 Hear, hear!

05:41.440 --> 05:43.080
 Stand for what?

05:43.160 --> 05:45.120
 As chairman of the
 allotment committee,

05:45.200 --> 05:49.080
 I propose we form an action
 group to oppose excavation.

05:49.160 --> 05:51.480
 -Who second?
 -I'll second.

05:51.560 --> 05:53.200
 Those in favour?

05:53.280 --> 05:55.200
 Good motion carried.

05:55.280 --> 05:56.520
 If there no objections,

05:56.600 --> 05:59.640
 I nominate myself as
 group coordinator.

05:59.720 --> 06:01.960
 Good, well I shall write

06:02.040 --> 06:04.720
 to the British
 Archaeological Association

06:04.800 --> 06:08.280
 and we should get
 our MP involved,

06:08.360 --> 06:10.280
 perhaps retain a solicitor.

06:10.360 --> 06:11.640
 If it comes to it

06:11.720 --> 06:14.880
 we may be able to apply
 for an injunction, hmm.

 the messenger.

 been growing my dinner

07:47.400 --> 07:49.360
 on an ancient grave
 all this time.

07:49.440 --> 07:51.880
 [sighs] It gives me the willies.

07:51.960 --> 07:54.000
 How long have you been up there?

07:54.080 --> 07:56.040
 About two years.

07:56.120 --> 07:57.760
 My husband left and took
 his income with him.

07:57.840 --> 08:01.120
 So I had to feed
 myself somehow, hmm.

08:01.200 --> 08:02.400
 It's very enterprising.

08:04.160 --> 08:06.560
 Frank took me under his wing.

08:06.640 --> 08:09.600
 If it wasn't for him I probably
 would have starved to death.

08:09.680 --> 08:11.560
 Nah, I'm sure you would
 have figured it out.

08:11.640 --> 08:13.160
 You seem very capable.

08:13.240 --> 08:16.120
 [chuckles] The veg maybe.

08:17.480 --> 08:20.000
 He also gave me a job
 in his textiles factory.

08:20.080 --> 08:22.120
 Sewing free knickers.

08:22.200 --> 08:25.440
 [Sam sighs] To be honest it
 turned out to be the best thing

08:25.520 --> 08:27.160
 that ever happened
 to me not leaving.

08:29.600 --> 08:31.520
 Sounds like a real community.

08:31.600 --> 08:32.880
 They're all looking
 out for each other.

08:32.960 --> 08:33.919
 Yeah, it is.

08:35.400 --> 08:37.600
 That's what you
 have to understand.

08:37.679 --> 08:38.919
 The allotments
 isn't just a place

08:39.000 --> 08:40.320
 where people go to
 grow vegetables,

08:40.400 --> 08:43.120
 it's home, and we're a family.

08:44.200 --> 08:45.960
 If anyone tries to take it away,

08:46.040 --> 08:48.840
 I predict that they'll have
 quite a fight on their hands.

 I'm sorry, Mrs. Clam,

09:01.560 --> 09:03.000
 but if I make an
 exception for you,

09:03.080 --> 09:04.880
 I have to make an
 exception for everyone.

 [sighs] Hello?

09:38.080 --> 09:40.040
 Do you want the good
 news or the bad news?

09:40.120 --> 09:41.640
 Well, both would be helpful.

09:41.720 --> 09:44.280
 Right, well, I managed
 to date the bones,

09:44.360 --> 09:45.880
 that's the good, by the way,

09:45.960 --> 09:49.720
 the bad is they're not as
 ancient as they first appear.

09:49.800 --> 09:52.440
 Oh, and I know where
 this is going, how old?

09:52.520 --> 09:54.280
 Two, maybe three years.

09:54.360 --> 09:55.920
 I'm afraid this isn't
 the scientific discovery

09:56.000 --> 09:57.120
 of the century after all.

09:58.600 --> 10:01.560
 -It's murder!
 -[tense music]

10:02.880 --> 10:04.360
 It appears the
 body was subjected

10:04.440 --> 10:07.120
 to a large amount
 of sodium hydroxide,

10:07.200 --> 10:08.600
 otherwise known as lye,

10:08.680 --> 10:10.880
 otherwise known as caustic soda.

10:10.960 --> 10:14.960
 Okay, where would you find
 large amounts of that?

10:15.040 --> 10:17.400
 Well it has numerous
 commercial applications.

10:17.480 --> 10:21.240
 It's used the manufacturer of
 everything from paper to soap,

10:21.320 --> 10:23.120
 in its pure form, it's
 actually a highly effective

10:23.200 --> 10:25.280
 industrial strength
 drain cleaner.

10:25.360 --> 10:27.040
 It is also used on
 farms and abattoirs

10:27.120 --> 10:28.560
 for the disposal of
 animal carcasses.

10:28.640 --> 10:30.400
 Oh, yes!

10:30.480 --> 10:33.640
 This will do nicely.
 [clears throat]

10:33.720 --> 10:36.960
 Fact, sodium hydroxide
 is highly soluble

10:37.040 --> 10:38.400
 and when mixed with water,

10:38.480 --> 10:40.480
 it will quickly break
 the chemical bonds,

10:40.560 --> 10:42.920
 which keep fresh intact
 in muscle bonded to bone.

10:43.000 --> 10:45.640
 In short, it will liquefy a body

10:45.720 --> 10:47.600
 leaving any chalky bone holes,

10:47.680 --> 10:50.400
 which can be easily give
 an impression of age.

10:50.480 --> 10:54.120
 It appears this was
 applied in a hurry though.

10:54.200 --> 10:57.480
 Note how some of the bones
 are slightly less affected,

10:57.560 --> 10:59.520
 -the skull, for example.
 -Hmm.

11:01.400 --> 11:04.360
 -Sorry, breakfast?
 -No I'm fine, thank you.

11:08.120 --> 11:10.080

11:10.160 --> 11:12.200
 Well, I don't think the
 dental remains can help,

11:12.280 --> 11:14.640
 but I could tell
 you their height and
 gender if we're lucky.

11:14.720 --> 11:16.680
 -Hmm.
 -That's about it, I'm afraid.

11:16.760 --> 11:17.520
 Look at this,

11:19.720 --> 11:21.880
 cardboard and lots of it.

11:23.280 --> 11:25.040
 Okay, let's pull the
 missing persons files

11:25.120 --> 11:26.840
 for the last three years,

11:26.920 --> 11:28.560
 let's hope something jumps out.

11:28.640 --> 11:30.520
 I'll get this batch of
 bones back to the lab.

11:30.600 --> 11:32.320
 Yeah, and I'm gonna go
 and talk to Ms. Paignton

 didn't see you there.

11:48.280 --> 11:49.840

 check on his marrow.

 me to cross the cordon.

 means more to him than I do.

 didn't see you here.

 -Save our allotment now.

12:12.200 --> 12:14.280
 -Save our allotment.
 -Save our allotment now.

12:14.360 --> 12:16.560
 -Save our allotment.
 -Save our allotment now.

12:16.640 --> 12:18.000
 [overlapping chatter]

12:18.080 --> 12:21.800
 All right, all right,
 you're saving the day.

12:21.880 --> 12:24.720
 -Your allotments are safe!
 -[Edie sighs]

12:24.800 --> 12:26.800
 -And the excavation?
 -Cancelled!

12:26.880 --> 12:29.160
 However, your allotments
 are now a crime scene

12:29.240 --> 12:31.920
 and will remain off limits
 until further notice!

12:32.000 --> 12:33.640
 -[overlapping chatter]
 -Crime scene!

12:35.840 --> 12:37.480
 That's way, thank you very much.

12:37.560 --> 12:38.360
 Come on.

12:38.440 --> 12:40.080
 Hey Edie.

12:40.160 --> 12:41.120
 -Edie, can I have a word?
 -Thank you, follow me out.

12:41.200 --> 12:45.240
 [people chattering indistinctly]

12:45.320 --> 12:47.880
 Your husband, Ned, wasn't it,

12:47.960 --> 12:51.160
 -left about two years ago?
 -Yeah, that's right.

12:51.240 --> 12:52.960
 Yeah, I wouldn't
 mind a word with him.

12:53.040 --> 12:56.280
 [sighs] Oh right,
 you and me both.

12:56.360 --> 12:57.640
 If you find him let me know.

12:58.720 --> 13:00.000
 So you haven't had any contact

13:00.080 --> 13:01.640
 since he told you
 he was leaving?

13:01.720 --> 13:03.000
 Didn't even have
 the guts to do that,

13:03.080 --> 13:05.160
 just wrote a note to say
 he was off, that was it?

13:05.240 --> 13:06.680
 No forwarding address?

13:06.760 --> 13:09.640
 I don't think he wanted
 us to stay pen pals.

13:09.720 --> 13:11.120
 Did you keep the letter?

13:11.200 --> 13:12.920
 [sighs] It's not
 the sort of thing

13:13.000 --> 13:15.160
 one keeps as a
 memento, Inspector?

13:15.240 --> 13:16.880
 No, of course.

13:16.960 --> 13:18.840
 I'm sorry I can't
 be of more help.

13:18.920 --> 13:20.840
 Don't worry, we'll
 track him down.

13:22.880 --> 13:27.600
 -[soft instrumental music]
 -[footstep pattering]

13:27.680 --> 13:31.040
 [car door open and shuts]

13:42.160 --> 13:44.520
 So you stooped to grave robbing?

13:44.600 --> 13:47.520
 [chuckles] That's very good.

13:47.600 --> 13:50.480
 Although I regard it more
 as temporary appropriation.

13:50.560 --> 13:52.840
 You asked about cardboard
 up on the allotment.

13:54.480 --> 13:56.800
 Oh, yes, marvellous!

13:56.880 --> 13:59.400
 Yes I was going to reread
 "The Murder of Roger Ackroyd,"

13:59.480 --> 14:00.760
 for obvious reasons,

14:00.840 --> 14:02.920
 but I'm sure this will
 be just as thrilling.

14:03.000 --> 14:03.800
 Okay.

14:08.080 --> 14:12.080
 Oh Sue, the cardboard
 technique, it's common, is it?

14:12.160 --> 14:13.560
 I'm not sure about common.

14:15.240 --> 14:17.760
 A short version is cardboard
 and there's large compost

14:17.840 --> 14:20.120
 and all these muckers you
 can get your hands on.

14:20.200 --> 14:23.040
 The cardboard smothers the
 weeds while it rots down,

14:23.120 --> 14:26.240
 and the muck tracks the
 worms, turn it over, job done.

14:27.560 --> 14:29.080
 It's ingenious.

14:29.160 --> 14:30.440
 Personally, I think
 if you're gonna oof

14:30.520 --> 14:32.000
 all that muck all
 the way up there,

14:32.080 --> 14:33.640
 you might as well have
 dug it over yourself.

14:33.720 --> 14:34.760
 [scoffs] Hitch the ran.

14:36.080 --> 14:38.840
 Poor soul, an untimely demise,

14:38.920 --> 14:40.400
 and the most unchristian burial.

14:42.080 --> 14:44.360
 [sighs] Covered in a tonne
 of manure, poor beggar.

14:46.200 --> 14:48.680
 [solemn music]

14:53.960 --> 14:56.920
 [car door opens]

14:57.000 --> 14:59.280
 I'm assuming they're all filed
 by dates of disappearance?

14:59.360 --> 15:00.440
 What is?

15:00.520 --> 15:02.400
 The missing persons record?

15:02.480 --> 15:04.560
 Yeah, I'd go with that.

15:04.640 --> 15:07.080
 Edie Paignton's plot is
 next to your dad, isn't it?

15:07.160 --> 15:07.960
 I'm sorry?

15:09.480 --> 15:11.000
 Do you know who
 had it before her?

15:11.080 --> 15:13.640
 No one did, it wasn't even
 really a plot as such,

15:13.720 --> 15:15.280
 just an abandoned corner.

15:15.360 --> 15:17.600
 There was a budge of
 Sinclair to let her have it.

15:17.680 --> 15:18.920
 What was his objection?

15:19.000 --> 15:21.320
 He said it wasn't
 regulation size.

15:21.400 --> 15:23.280
 Oh, you know what he's like,
 never rapper even though

15:23.360 --> 15:25.360
 when he has a rule
 book for someone.

15:25.440 --> 15:27.040
 But she persisted.

15:27.120 --> 15:29.080
 Went over his head to the
 parish council in the end,

15:29.160 --> 15:30.440
 'caused the right old stink.

15:32.280 --> 15:35.680
 [soft instrumental music]

15:37.120 --> 15:39.280
 [car door opens]

15:39.360 --> 15:41.200
 I was trying to do her a favour.

15:41.280 --> 15:42.880
 By refusing her.

15:42.960 --> 15:45.280
 Well, she didn't know
 what she'd be taking on.

15:45.360 --> 15:47.840
 She thought she could just
 turn up and start growing.

15:47.920 --> 15:52.600
 But well, that land had
 never been cultivated.

15:52.680 --> 15:54.680
 If it wouldn't have been for
 Frank's no-dig suggestion,

15:54.760 --> 15:57.360
 she'd still been
 trying to clear it now.

15:57.440 --> 15:59.600
 So the no-dig was Frank's idea.

15:59.680 --> 16:02.840
 She was hard to get
 anything if it was it.

16:02.920 --> 16:03.720
 Thank you.

16:05.080 --> 16:08.880
 [soft instrumental music]

16:08.960 --> 16:11.280
 -[bottles clanking]
 -[car door opens]

16:11.360 --> 16:14.680
 [birds chirping]

16:14.760 --> 16:19.520
 Work's been slow on account
 of how delicate the bones are.

16:21.280 --> 16:23.680
 Any idea if it's male or female?

16:23.760 --> 16:26.680
 Well, the shape of the pelvis
 is usually an indicator,

16:26.760 --> 16:29.040
 but as you can see
 much of this one's

16:29.120 --> 16:30.440
 -crumbled away completely.
 -Hmm.

16:30.520 --> 16:32.160
 But on the basis
 of probabilities,

16:32.240 --> 16:35.280
 I'd say they're more likely
 to be male than female,

16:35.360 --> 16:37.920
 but it's impossible to say
 with any absolute certainty

16:38.920 --> 16:40.240
 Height?

16:40.320 --> 16:43.200
 Between 5 foot 6 and 5 foot 11.

16:43.280 --> 16:44.800
 Hmm, it narrows it down.

16:44.880 --> 16:47.840
 Oh, but the good news is I've
 pieced together the skull,

16:47.920 --> 16:48.680
 look at this.

16:50.080 --> 16:52.680
 Cause of death, the blow
 to the back of the head,

16:52.760 --> 16:55.000
 or rather three blows.

16:56.480 --> 16:58.600
 -Made with?
 -Though, I had no idea.

17:00.200 --> 17:01.120
 Yes I appreciate it
 that's not much to go on,

17:01.200 --> 17:02.760
 but I'm working on it.

17:02.840 --> 17:04.760
 Missing persons for
 the last three years.

17:04.839 --> 17:06.079
 Mm. [clears throat]

17:06.160 --> 17:09.079
 So [indistinct]
 Walter Sinn, age 46.

17:09.160 --> 17:10.760
 No, she turned up.

17:10.839 --> 17:13.280
 She ran off with her tennis
 coach from Santorini,

17:13.359 --> 17:14.359
 if I remember rightly.

17:15.680 --> 17:17.760
 That's not mentioned
 on the files.

17:17.839 --> 17:18.720
 It's all up here.

17:20.680 --> 17:21.960
 [Felix clears throat]

17:22.040 --> 17:23.520
 Wait what's that,
 Yorkshire Police?

17:23.599 --> 17:24.839
 They lodged an inquiry

17:24.920 --> 17:26.839
 regarding one of
 their missing persons.

17:26.920 --> 17:29.360
 Apparently, he had business
 dealings in Great Slaughter,

17:29.440 --> 17:31.760
 -and had spent some time here.
 -Sidney Jackson?

17:34.600 --> 17:36.040
 No, it doesn't ring a bell.

17:36.120 --> 17:38.040
 I requested the full report,

17:38.120 --> 17:41.640
 but it was destroyed when their
 archive flooded last year.

17:41.720 --> 17:43.680
 Okay, well see what
 you can dig up on him.

17:43.760 --> 17:47.120
 -Mm, no pun intended.
 -[Sam chuckles]

17:48.200 --> 17:51.120
 Jenny Harsden, age 23,

17:51.200 --> 17:52.800
 reported missing by
 her father Frank-

17:52.880 --> 17:55.280
 Wait, Frank Harsden.

17:55.360 --> 17:57.680
 That's Frank from the
 allotment, isn't it?

17:57.760 --> 18:00.000
 Yeah, he's got the plot
 next to Edie Paignton.

18:00.080 --> 18:02.720
 [suspenseful dramatic music]

18:02.800 --> 18:04.000
 -Right?
 -Yeah.

18:05.280 --> 18:09.680
 [suspenseful dramatic
 music continues]

18:15.480 --> 18:16.280
 It's not her.

18:17.480 --> 18:18.480
 You seem very sure.

18:19.400 --> 18:21.080
 She's in London,

18:21.160 --> 18:24.080
 wrote to me a few
 months after she left.

18:24.160 --> 18:26.080
 Well, you didn't
 tell the police?

18:26.160 --> 18:28.240
 She's still listed as missing.

18:28.320 --> 18:29.640
 You haven't done a very
 good job of looking for her

18:29.720 --> 18:30.640
 then have you?

18:30.720 --> 18:33.080
 Hmm, what did the letter say?

18:34.600 --> 18:37.200
 Ah, that she was safe,

18:37.280 --> 18:40.720
 and the baby had been
 born, a boy apparently.

18:41.680 --> 18:43.080
 Do you have an address?

18:43.160 --> 18:46.360
 No, somewhere in Peckham.

18:48.000 --> 18:49.160
 She didn't want to see me.

18:51.360 --> 18:52.120
 Why not?

18:54.200 --> 18:56.720
 Look, I know you're just
 doing your job, Inspector,

18:56.800 --> 18:59.120
 but you're barking
 up the wrong tree.

19:00.520 --> 19:01.720
 Whoever you found
 out on that plot,

19:02.640 --> 19:03.440
 it's not my Jenny.

19:06.560 --> 19:10.560

 -[birds chirping]
 -[footstep pattering]

19:14.080 --> 19:15.080
 Okay, yeah.

19:17.440 --> 19:19.760
 -Yeah.
 -[phone ringing]

19:19.840 --> 19:23.480
 Okay, thank you,
 that is very helpful.

19:23.560 --> 19:27.200
 -Okay bye, bye.
 -What's helpful?

19:27.280 --> 19:29.280
 Three years ago, Sidney
 Jackson made an application

19:29.360 --> 19:31.160
 to buy the allotments
 from the council.

19:31.240 --> 19:33.400
 He planned to sell the land
 to a chain of supermarkets,

19:33.480 --> 19:36.400
 but he disappeared before the
 final paperwork was signed.

19:37.840 --> 19:41.120
 -Did he now?
 -[suspenseful dramatic music]

19:41.200 --> 19:43.880
 [knife chopping]

19:45.760 --> 19:49.440
 Of course, Sinclair was in
 charge of the action committee.

19:49.520 --> 19:51.120
 That pompous old
 twit with no action,

19:51.200 --> 19:53.240
 if it kicked him in the goalies.

19:53.320 --> 19:55.280
 He's all regulations
 this and procedure that.

19:55.360 --> 19:56.880
 I mean no offence,

19:56.960 --> 19:59.200
 but I tell you, that supermarket

19:59.280 --> 20:01.080
 would have been half the
 village out of business.

20:01.160 --> 20:03.760
 Me included, 200 years
 of Buttons Butcher

20:03.840 --> 20:05.080
 down the squally.

20:05.160 --> 20:06.360
 I can't believe
 you never told me.

20:06.440 --> 20:08.560
 You were away at police
 training college.

20:08.640 --> 20:10.040
 I wasn't gonna
 bother you with it.

20:10.120 --> 20:13.280
 -So what happened?
 -Well, he just disappeared.

20:13.360 --> 20:15.200
 Do you remember the
 last time you saw him?

20:15.280 --> 20:17.920
 Oh yeah, it was one of
 Sinclair's committee meetings.

20:19.840 --> 20:21.680
 "A decision within
 10 working days,"

20:21.760 --> 20:25.200
 -they said, that's all I know.
 -And if they rule against us?

20:25.280 --> 20:26.320
 That will be that.

20:26.400 --> 20:28.120
 And when can we expect to hear?

20:28.200 --> 20:30.040
 Hear up, there they come.

20:30.120 --> 20:32.240

20:38.800 --> 20:40.360
 You're not welcome
 here, Jackson?

20:42.560 --> 20:45.120
 I thought you'd want
 to hear the good news,

20:45.200 --> 20:49.160
 decision's through,
 appeal denied.

20:49.240 --> 20:50.880
 Oh!

20:50.960 --> 20:54.160
 I'm signing the land papers
 at 9:00 AM tomorrow morning.

20:54.240 --> 20:56.920
 I suggest you collect anything
 you want to keep before then,

20:58.200 --> 21:02.880
 after that, it's
 mine. [evil laughter]

 greasol bucket, Peg Doll?

21:13.240 --> 21:16.320
 [metal bucket clanks]

21:18.400 --> 21:20.240
 You didn't wonder what
 had happened to him?

21:20.320 --> 21:22.000
 Yeah, of course we did.

21:22.080 --> 21:23.240
 We weren't going to go
 looking for him, were we?

21:23.320 --> 21:24.680
 We were just glad it was over.

21:32.720 --> 21:35.560
 So you recognise
 him then, the body?

21:37.000 --> 21:38.920
 It's one of the possibilities
 we're exploring.

21:39.000 --> 21:40.640
 Yeah, well, good luck if it is.

21:40.720 --> 21:42.320
 Swing a cat and
 you'll find 10 people

21:42.400 --> 21:43.920
 who'll wanna see
 the bugger Jackson.

21:44.000 --> 21:46.800
 Don't suppose you will
 ever find out who did it.

21:46.880 --> 21:49.400
 Here, faggots for tea,
 Peg Doll, don't be late.

22:14.200 --> 22:18.240
 Aha, note three blows
 with one instrument,

22:18.320 --> 22:20.360
 but one blow with three.

22:20.440 --> 22:22.480
 You're saying this could
 be the murder weapon?

 We'll have to take it to the
 lab for further examination,

22:24.400 --> 22:26.480
 but potentially, yes.

 Ah, yeah Inspector.

22:51.280 --> 22:53.520
 Frank, what are you doing here?

22:53.600 --> 22:55.080
 You know that the allotments
 are out of bounds.

22:55.160 --> 22:57.040
 I'm sorry, I just...

22:57.120 --> 23:00.600
 I thought I'd left my reading
 glasses here, somewhere.

23:00.680 --> 23:02.160
 I'm gonna have to
 escort you out.

23:02.240 --> 23:03.840
 All right, all right.

23:08.560 --> 23:12.080
 [sighs] What's this?

23:12.160 --> 23:13.600
 You can't possibly think Edie's

23:13.680 --> 23:15.080
 got anything to do with this,

23:15.160 --> 23:17.080
 -this girl wouldn't harm a fly.
 -I'll escort you out.

23:17.160 --> 23:19.480
 Yeah, and that won't
 tell you anything.

23:19.560 --> 23:20.840
 They're 10 a penny.

23:20.920 --> 23:22.760
 I got one just like it, myself.

23:24.280 --> 23:29.120
 -[birds chirping]
 -[door shuts]

23:31.080 --> 23:33.400
 -See.
 -[bird cawing]

23:33.480 --> 23:34.720
 Well perhaps Mr. Harsden,

23:34.800 --> 23:37.520
 you'll so kind as to
 allow us an examination.

23:37.600 --> 23:39.600
 -Well, be my guest.
 -Thank you.

23:41.280 --> 23:43.560
 I should think there's one of
 these in every shed on site.

23:45.360 --> 23:46.880
 Right, I'll leave
 you to it then.

23:47.880 --> 23:50.600
 [birds chirping]

23:51.920 --> 23:54.840
 Reading glasses, he
 must think I'm an idiot.

23:54.920 --> 23:57.360
 He was down here checking
 on his bleeding marrow.

23:58.960 --> 24:00.160
 If he's worried about
 everyone having one of these

24:00.240 --> 24:01.840
 and perhaps you could
 have a quick peek

24:01.920 --> 24:04.040
 in Sinclair's shed before we go.

24:04.120 --> 24:06.440
 check all three of them. Oh,
 what was that! [bee humming]

24:06.520 --> 24:07.680
 What's that, a bee?

24:07.760 --> 24:09.840
 -All right, come on.
 -Hiss it away.

24:09.920 --> 24:14.800
 -Oh no, wait!
 -[bee humming]

24:19.000 --> 24:20.520
 [callipers clink]

24:20.600 --> 24:23.080
 Ah close, but no cigar.

24:23.160 --> 24:26.760
 [sighs] You're sure,
 none of these match?

24:26.840 --> 24:27.600
 I'm afraid not.

24:28.960 --> 24:31.120
 But we're on the right
 track though, fear not.

24:31.200 --> 24:33.080
 These cultivators are
 the right shape and size,

24:33.160 --> 24:34.760
 and the good news is,

24:34.840 --> 24:36.720
 the one we're looking for
 will be most distinctive.

24:36.800 --> 24:38.040
 One of these prongs

24:38.120 --> 24:40.000
 will be just ever so
 slightly bent inwards.

24:42.400 --> 24:45.400
 There's a good chance that
 none of these three did it?

24:45.480 --> 24:46.920
 It's a puzzle, isn't it?

24:47.000 --> 24:49.160
 [sighs] What's next?

24:49.240 --> 24:50.720
 Well, I'm glad you've asked.

24:50.800 --> 24:53.080
 So once the bones were
 removed from the site,

24:53.160 --> 24:55.760
 I collected an additional spit
 step for soar from all sides

24:55.840 --> 24:57.280
 and underneath, just in case.

24:57.360 --> 24:59.760
 -What I'm I looking at?
 -Teeth.

24:59.840 --> 25:01.520
 Not bad condition either.

25:01.600 --> 25:03.120
 I'll put them together
 and take an impression,

25:03.200 --> 25:05.360
 then check it against
 dental records for an ID.

25:05.440 --> 25:07.760
 -Will that work?
 -Only one way to find out.

25:10.920 --> 25:13.920
 [footstep pattering]

25:14.960 --> 25:16.840
 No match on the murder weapon.

25:16.920 --> 25:18.480
 [sighs] How are you doing?

25:18.560 --> 25:20.880
 I've requested Jenny
 Harsden's medical records.

25:20.960 --> 25:22.440
 If Frank is telling the truth,

25:22.520 --> 25:23.840
 there'll be a record
 of the pregnancy.

25:23.920 --> 25:25.120
 -Excellent!
 -[phone ringing]

25:25.200 --> 25:26.880
 Any more on Jackson?

25:26.960 --> 25:29.760
 His mother no longer resides
 at her last own address,

25:29.840 --> 25:31.520
 she doesn't appear on
 the electoral register,

25:31.600 --> 25:33.240
 father unknown, no siblings.

25:33.320 --> 25:35.080
 Okay, we'll stay on it.

25:35.160 --> 25:36.280
 What about Ned Paignton?

25:37.640 --> 25:39.000
 We've drawn up a list
 of friends, family,

25:39.080 --> 25:40.280
 and business associates,

25:40.360 --> 25:42.200
 WPC Button is working
 through it now.

25:42.280 --> 25:44.800
 Okay good, I'm gonna
 stop at another pub,

25:44.880 --> 25:47.400
 see if I can coax any useful
 information of the locals.

25:49.600 --> 25:52.520
 It's also the local single
 ladies Bridge night,

25:52.600 --> 25:54.680
 if I'm not mistaken.

25:54.760 --> 25:57.280
 Ah, happy coincidence Felix.

25:57.360 --> 25:59.160
 You know me, duty first.

26:01.560 --> 26:05.200
 [suspenseful dramatic music]

26:27.680 --> 26:29.600
 [clears throat]

26:29.680 --> 26:32.400
 [paper rustling]

26:33.440 --> 26:37.080
 [suspenseful dramatic music]

27:21.000 --> 27:21.880
 I wonder.

27:23.720 --> 27:28.160
 [suspenseful dramatic
 music continues]

27:48.560 --> 27:51.080
 [clears throat]

27:51.160 --> 27:53.280
 [tooth clatters]

27:53.360 --> 27:56.040
 [liquid sloshing]

28:02.600 --> 28:03.400
 Bingo!

28:10.000 --> 28:11.960
 Is that what I think it is?

28:12.040 --> 28:13.440
 Well, if what you think it is,

28:13.520 --> 28:15.120
 it is the right maxillary
 lateral incisor,

28:15.200 --> 28:16.760
 then yes it is.

28:16.840 --> 28:19.160
 -A gold tooth.
 -18 carat.

28:21.120 --> 28:24.320
 [soft classical music]

28:26.560 --> 28:29.880
 Say hello to Sydney Jackson.

28:29.960 --> 28:31.240
 You beauty!

28:31.320 --> 28:32.680
 Right now we've got our victim,

28:32.760 --> 28:35.000
 we need to widen the net.

28:35.080 --> 28:38.080
 Motive, Sinclair was
 fighting for the allotment,

28:38.160 --> 28:40.000
 but plenty of people
 would have been affected

28:40.080 --> 28:41.280
 by the supermarket.

28:41.360 --> 28:44.480
 It means we need to
 find out who had access

28:44.560 --> 28:46.160
 to large amounts
 of caustic soda,

28:46.240 --> 28:50.200
 who knew the allotments
 and opportunity...

28:50.280 --> 28:51.440
 What's the matter?

28:51.520 --> 28:54.240
 This is the break
 we've been waiting for.

28:54.320 --> 28:57.040
 -I'm...
 -Well, spit it out.

29:01.000 --> 29:04.240
 [Felix sighs]

29:04.320 --> 29:06.000
 This is ridiculous!

29:06.080 --> 29:07.680
 I think I'd know if my
 own dad was a murderer.

29:07.760 --> 29:09.080
 It's just to rule him out.

29:09.160 --> 29:12.680
 I'm sure this will
 put them in the clear.

29:12.760 --> 29:16.440
 [suspenseful dramatic music]

29:19.040 --> 29:19.840
 Oh no!

29:21.240 --> 29:23.240
 There you go Hester,
 regards to your mum.

29:23.320 --> 29:24.800
 Will do, thank you, Mr. Button.

29:24.880 --> 29:26.440
 All right, Sam [mumbles]

29:26.520 --> 29:29.800
 I've got a nice bit of bacon
 put aside for you, my friend.

29:29.880 --> 29:31.640
 Actually Ted, I'm
 gonna have to ask you

29:31.720 --> 29:32.760
 to come down a station.

29:34.960 --> 29:38.200
 I've used caustic soda years,
 it's standard practise.

29:39.880 --> 29:42.280
 I saw Ms. Thimble cleaning her
 drains with the other week.

29:42.360 --> 29:43.880
 You gonna arrest her too?

29:43.960 --> 29:47.400
 And I told you, half the
 village wanted rid of Jackson,

29:47.480 --> 29:49.920
 it's not just me that
 stood to lose everything.

29:50.000 --> 29:51.520
 I want to believe you Ted, I do,

29:51.600 --> 29:53.280
 but it's not that simple.

29:53.360 --> 29:56.840
 This is a photograph of
 Sidney Jackson's fatal injury,

29:56.920 --> 30:00.400
 and this is the implement
 which caused it.

30:00.480 --> 30:02.680
 Oh then that's
 not my cultivator.

30:02.760 --> 30:06.040
 But it was found in your
 shed, can you explain that?

30:07.040 --> 30:09.680
 [sighs] No I can't.

30:11.960 --> 30:13.440
 Ted Button, I'm arresting you

30:13.520 --> 30:14.760
 for the murder of
 Sydney Jackson.

30:14.840 --> 30:16.280
 Sam, come on lad.

30:16.360 --> 30:17.520
 You're not obliged
 to say anything

30:17.600 --> 30:19.040
 unless you wish to do so,

30:19.120 --> 30:21.080
 but what you say will
 be put into writing

30:21.160 --> 30:23.120
 and maybe given as evidence.

30:23.200 --> 30:24.960
 -[Ted scoffs]
 -I'm sorry.

30:26.840 --> 30:31.680
 -[sombre music]
 -[footstep pattering]

30:33.720 --> 30:36.240
 -Open up.
 -You can't be serious, sir.

30:36.320 --> 30:38.360
 You're making a
 terrible mistake.

30:38.440 --> 30:42.240
 -[door shuts]
 -[Peggy shrugs]

30:42.320 --> 30:47.120
 -[sombre music continues]
 -[Felix sighs]

30:52.840 --> 30:57.160
 -Peggy.
 -[sharpener clanking]

30:57.240 --> 31:01.720
 -I'm so-
 -[sharpener clanking]

31:01.800 --> 31:03.520
 [people chattering indistinctly]

31:03.600 --> 31:05.840
 -[door creaks]
 -[door shuts]

31:05.920 --> 31:10.760
 -[phone rings]
 -[door shuts]

31:14.840 --> 31:17.960
 -[door shuts]
 -[Felix sighs]

31:18.040 --> 31:21.200
 -[door knock]
 -Can we?

31:23.800 --> 31:26.280
 Fear not Sergeant we'll
 get to the bottom of it.

31:26.360 --> 31:28.160
 I was only following the facts.

31:28.240 --> 31:29.480
 Yes I know,

31:29.560 --> 31:32.920
 and so does WPC Button,
 she'll come around.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.480
 -Post.
 -Thank you!

31:36.480 --> 31:37.280
 Eventually.

31:39.920 --> 31:41.360
 Jenny Harsden's medical records,

31:41.440 --> 31:43.520
 no doubt confirming
 Franks theory.

31:43.600 --> 31:46.240
 [paper rustling]

31:49.440 --> 31:52.040
 Pregnant, just like you said.

31:52.120 --> 31:54.520
 [Felix sighs]

31:56.120 --> 31:59.760
 [suspenseful dramatic music]

32:04.760 --> 32:09.520
 A broken arm, a sprained wrist,
 bruised ribs, a black eye?

32:10.520 --> 32:11.760
 There's always an excuse,

32:11.840 --> 32:14.360
 a slip on the stairs and
 an open cupboard door.

32:14.440 --> 32:16.400
 So Frank was knocking her out.

32:16.480 --> 32:17.640
 No wonder the poor girl

32:17.720 --> 32:18.920
 didn't want to
 raise her baby here.

32:19.000 --> 32:20.000
 And if that's what
 you do to her,

32:20.080 --> 32:21.280
 what might he do to the man

32:21.360 --> 32:24.280
 who got his daughter
 pregnant out of wedlock?

32:24.360 --> 32:25.920
 I spoke to civil registry office

32:26.000 --> 32:28.320
 and I asked them to locate a
 copy of the birth certificate.

32:28.400 --> 32:30.600
 Oh, drum roll, please!

32:30.680 --> 32:35.200
 The father of Jenny Harsden's
 baby is, Sidney Jackson!

32:35.280 --> 32:38.560
 -Good man, great work!
 -[Felix chuckles]

32:38.640 --> 32:42.280
 Now there is just
 one tiny problem,

32:42.360 --> 32:43.920
 we've yet to prove the link

32:44.000 --> 32:46.360
 between Mr. Harsden
 and the murder weapon.

32:46.440 --> 32:48.880
 Well, you better get cracking
 'cause I'm bringing him in.

32:50.920 --> 32:52.360
 If you have any bright
 ideas, Sergeant,

32:52.440 --> 32:54.480
 now would be a good
 time to mention them.

32:55.440 --> 32:56.560
 I do have one.

32:58.520 --> 33:02.600
 -I knew you would.
 -[Felix laughs]

33:02.680 --> 33:07.440
 -[car engine rattling]
 -[suspenseful dramatic music]

33:09.440 --> 33:11.160
 We've photographed the
 contest every year,

33:11.240 --> 33:12.960
 and I never destroy a negative.

33:13.040 --> 33:15.480
 Don't know when it
 might come in handy.

33:15.560 --> 33:17.400
 [sighs] Are you going to tell
 me what you're looking for?

33:17.480 --> 33:20.080
 Confidential police
 business, I'm afraid.

33:20.160 --> 33:22.160
 Well, then you might
 be here for awhile.

33:22.240 --> 33:27.080
 -[door opens]
 -[footstep pattering]

33:28.640 --> 33:32.440
 -[distant typewriter clicking]
 -[footstep pattering]

33:39.000 --> 33:40.080
 We best get started.

33:44.720 --> 33:47.080
 [door opens]

33:49.080 --> 33:51.520
 [door shuts]

33:53.600 --> 33:55.480
 You never told us
 that Sidney Jackson

33:55.560 --> 33:57.800
 is the father of Jenny's baby?

33:57.880 --> 33:59.440
 You've never asked.

33:59.520 --> 34:01.560
 I can't imagine you were too
 thrilled to find that out?

34:02.960 --> 34:04.840
 Did he offer to marry her?

34:04.920 --> 34:07.680
 [scoffs] I wouldn't have her
 let him marry that tow rack,

34:07.760 --> 34:09.440
 if he was the last man on earth.

34:09.520 --> 34:13.000
 No, how far would you
 have gone to stop it?

34:13.080 --> 34:14.719
 I'm not a violent
 man, Inspector.

34:15.600 --> 34:16.400
 Really?

34:17.760 --> 34:20.159
 So how do you explain
 these broken bones

34:20.239 --> 34:22.120
 in your daughter's
 medical records?

34:24.480 --> 34:26.320
 She always was a clumsy girl.

34:26.400 --> 34:28.000
 Come on Frank,

34:28.080 --> 34:30.120
 if you're man enough to
 knock a young girl around,

34:30.199 --> 34:31.880
 you should be man
 enough to admit it.

34:35.480 --> 34:37.800
 [Frank clears throat]

34:37.880 --> 34:38.679
 Is this yours?

34:40.280 --> 34:43.000
 I told you before these
 things are 10 a penny,

34:43.080 --> 34:44.960
 they all look alike.

34:45.040 --> 34:46.520
 It's subtle, but this one

34:46.600 --> 34:50.199
 is actually ever so
 slightly bent, just here.

34:50.280 --> 34:53.760
 You expect me to know every
 knock and dent in my tools.

34:53.840 --> 34:55.600
 No one could tell you that.

34:55.679 --> 34:58.120
 What if I was to tell you
 that this is the cultivator

34:58.200 --> 35:00.480
 that killed Sidney Jackson?

35:00.560 --> 35:02.080
 I'd ask you where you found it.

35:03.080 --> 35:04.560
 Well that's the funny thing,

35:04.640 --> 35:07.080
 the person whose
 shed we found it in,

35:07.160 --> 35:09.400
 none of their
 fingerprints were on it.

35:09.480 --> 35:10.760
 -No?
 -No.

35:12.040 --> 35:13.520
 Anybody else's
 fingerprints on it?

35:14.960 --> 35:16.280
 [breathes deeply] No!

35:17.960 --> 35:20.600
 I suppose that's the thing
 about gardeners, Inspector.

35:20.680 --> 35:21.840
 They tend to wear a glove.

35:23.120 --> 35:25.480
 Let's cut to the chase, Frank,

35:25.560 --> 35:26.800
 the other day at the allotments,

35:26.880 --> 35:29.000
 you weren't looking
 for your glasses.

35:29.080 --> 35:31.560
 You were switching your
 cultivator with Ted's!

35:34.600 --> 35:37.920
 And you can prove
 that, I suppose.

35:41.360 --> 35:43.600
 [breathes deeply]

35:43.680 --> 35:45.760
 Dad, I brought you a brew.

35:45.840 --> 35:48.600
 Ho, ho, that's my girl!

35:53.240 --> 35:56.440
 [slurps coffee] Hmm.

35:56.520 --> 36:00.000
 So, reckon there'll be
 reopening the allotments soon,

36:00.080 --> 36:01.160
 will they?

36:01.240 --> 36:02.120
 Well you're not still thinking

36:02.200 --> 36:04.080
 about the soddy marrow contest?

36:04.160 --> 36:07.200
 Oh, I thought I was in
 a good chance this year.

36:07.280 --> 36:10.560
 -Wayne's, is this afternoon.
 -Oh, that's that then.

36:10.640 --> 36:12.600
 You know what Sinclair is like,

36:12.680 --> 36:15.680
 someone's got to be there in
 person or you're disqualified.

36:17.720 --> 36:18.720
 [sighs] All that work!

36:21.080 --> 36:22.600
 All that effort for naught.

36:25.200 --> 36:27.480
 -All right, fine I'll go.
 -That's my good girl.

36:27.560 --> 36:29.880
 But you know, I'm sure this
 will be cleared up any minute.

36:29.960 --> 36:31.520
 And then you can go yourself.

36:31.600 --> 36:34.120
 Oh, come on Peg, don't we
 both know how it looks.

36:34.200 --> 36:37.600
 Go see if they can prove
 that cultivator was planted.

36:37.680 --> 36:39.920
 Even your Sister Boniface
 can't perform miracles.

36:43.640 --> 36:45.480
 [door shuts]

36:45.560 --> 36:47.960
 [tense music]

36:53.000 --> 36:54.640
 It's no use, there's
 nothing here.

36:57.600 --> 36:59.160
 Not luck here
 either, I'm afraid.

37:00.680 --> 37:03.480
 I suppose it would have
 been rather convenient,

37:03.560 --> 37:06.480
 a photograph of the suspect
 with the murder we...

37:09.880 --> 37:10.680
 Sister?

37:12.440 --> 37:14.320
 I need to head back to the lab.

37:14.400 --> 37:17.360
 [footstep pattering]

37:20.480 --> 37:23.160
 [birds chirping]

37:23.240 --> 37:24.760
 43.

37:24.840 --> 37:28.920
 43 pounds, 43!

37:30.880 --> 37:33.600
 Let's talk about caustic soda.

37:33.680 --> 37:36.200
 I understand it's widely
 used in the textile industry.

37:40.400 --> 37:41.680
 [crowd claps]

37:41.760 --> 37:44.400
 [Sinclair] Next
 up, Edie Paignton.

37:44.480 --> 37:46.920
 [crowd claps]

37:50.240 --> 37:52.240
 Is it true, your father
 has been arrested?

37:52.320 --> 37:53.120
 No!

37:54.840 --> 37:57.160
 Yes, but it's been a mistake,
 they're sorting it now.

37:59.680 --> 38:01.000
 Where's Frank?

38:02.360 --> 38:05.280
 [suspenseful music]

38:10.840 --> 38:12.640
 Inspector, I've got a
 marrow judging to get to,

38:12.720 --> 38:15.680
 so unless you've got anything
 else, I think we're done here.

38:18.160 --> 38:19.360
 -Rhubarb!
 -[door opens]

38:19.440 --> 38:21.520
 Hello Sam, may we?

38:21.600 --> 38:22.360
 Yes.

38:25.160 --> 38:26.480
 [door shuts]

38:26.560 --> 38:28.080
 You once had a rather
 handsome croft of it,

38:28.160 --> 38:28.960
 rhubarb that is.

38:30.640 --> 38:32.600
 Ted's croft to you looks
 rather tiny in comparison,

38:32.680 --> 38:34.560
 lovely brassicas though.

38:34.640 --> 38:37.360
 -[phone rings]
 -[paper rustling]

38:37.440 --> 38:40.840
 [sighs] What is she on about?

38:40.920 --> 38:42.880
 In and of itself, that
 doesn't tell us much,

38:42.960 --> 38:44.160
 but you got me thinking

38:44.240 --> 38:45.560
 about something that
 I read recently.

38:47.160 --> 38:50.040
 Fact, rhubarb
 thrives best in soil

38:50.120 --> 38:52.600
 that has a pH between 6 and 6.5.

38:52.680 --> 38:53.840
 Brassicas on the other hand,

38:53.920 --> 38:55.320
 prefer their soils
 slightly more alkaline,

38:55.400 --> 38:58.760
 pH of 7 or above is ideal.

38:58.840 --> 39:00.400
 And for the most part it
 doesn't make much difference,

39:00.480 --> 39:01.800
 most plants will tolerate

39:01.880 --> 39:03.800
 a range of growing
 conditions by a time.

39:03.880 --> 39:05.400
 As you can see, your soil

39:05.480 --> 39:08.440
 is actually rather than
 much more acidic than Teds,

39:08.520 --> 39:09.560
 which is more alkaline.

39:10.760 --> 39:12.320
 So?

39:12.400 --> 39:14.200
 We tested the soil from the
 cultivator in your shed.

39:16.600 --> 39:18.840
 We also tested a soil
 from the murder weapon

39:18.920 --> 39:20.480
 found a Mr. Button's shed.

39:21.840 --> 39:23.880
 Which proves
 incontrovertibly, I'm afraid,

39:23.960 --> 39:27.280
 that the cultivators
 was switched.

39:29.800 --> 39:30.720
 Good man!

39:31.800 --> 39:33.760
 Frank, give it up!

39:33.840 --> 39:35.760
 You might as well tell
 us what really happened.

39:38.120 --> 39:40.240
 [glass shattering]

39:40.320 --> 39:42.080
 Oh, was that quite necessary?

39:42.160 --> 39:43.640
 Sit down Mr. Harsden!

39:43.720 --> 39:46.800
 He was a slimy,
 arrogant, little toad!

39:46.880 --> 39:49.240
 Looking down his nose at
 us, thinking he was better.

39:50.680 --> 39:54.160
 -[birds cawing]
 -[suspenseful dramatic music]

39:54.240 --> 39:56.040
 -Time's up Frank,
 -[chain clanking]

39:56.120 --> 39:57.480
 everyone else has cleared out.

40:00.760 --> 40:02.840
 How's Jenny these days,

40:02.920 --> 40:06.880
 -she had her sprog yet?
 -What's it to you?

40:06.960 --> 40:08.080
 [scoffs] Well nothing.

40:09.360 --> 40:10.680
 I told her to get rid,

40:10.760 --> 40:12.640
 even bought her the gin.

40:14.320 --> 40:15.160
 [scoffs] Silly cow!

40:17.000 --> 40:18.520
 You!

40:18.600 --> 40:20.520
 Didn't you know, she
 couldn't get enough of me.

40:22.360 --> 40:24.440
 [laughs]

40:25.800 --> 40:29.040
 Now hurry up and get
 off my land. [clicks]

40:29.120 --> 40:32.000
 -[birds cawing]
 -[birds chirping]

40:32.080 --> 40:33.520

40:33.600 --> 40:38.480
 -[Frank screams]
 -[head thuds]

40:39.480 --> 40:41.000
 I did the village of favour.

40:41.080 --> 40:43.480
 You find one person around
 here sorry he's gone.

40:43.560 --> 40:46.480
 Huh, even his own mother
 barely looked for him.

40:47.960 --> 40:49.040
 You do the honours,

40:49.120 --> 40:49.920
 well go and spring Ted.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.720
 It would be my pleasure.

40:52.680 --> 40:54.200
 Frank Harsden,

40:54.280 --> 40:55.600
 I'm arresting you for the
 murder of Sidney Thomas Jackson.

40:55.680 --> 40:56.840
 You are not obliged
 to say anything

40:56.920 --> 40:58.200
 unless you wish to do so.

40:58.280 --> 40:59.920
 But what you say may
 be put into writing

41:00.000 --> 41:03.080
 -and given in evidence.
 -[door shuts]

41:03.160 --> 41:07.120
 [people chattering indistinctly]

41:08.240 --> 41:09.520
 -51.
 -51 pounds.

41:11.480 --> 41:15.200
 51, we have a
 winner, Ted Button!

41:15.280 --> 41:18.920
 -Come on up, Ted.
 -[crowd clapping]

41:19.000 --> 41:20.280
 What's this?

41:20.360 --> 41:23.240
 Dad's been waylaid,
 so he sent me instead.

41:23.320 --> 41:24.760
 No, no, no, this wont do at all,

41:24.840 --> 41:26.440
 the rules are quite clear,

41:26.520 --> 41:29.640
 entrants must be in attendance
 to be eligible to win.

41:29.720 --> 41:31.960
 No, no, no, I'm sorry, it'll
 have to be disqualified.

41:32.040 --> 41:34.360
 So the winner is
 the next heaviest,

41:34.440 --> 41:39.280
 -which is-
 -[sirens blaring]

41:45.280 --> 41:48.680
 [soft instrumental music]

41:53.920 --> 41:55.360
 Oh you won, Dad!

41:55.440 --> 41:56.920
 -Come up!
 -Yeah!

41:57.000 --> 42:01.520
 -[crowd clapping]
 -[whooping]

42:01.600 --> 42:06.440
 -[Ted jubilating]
 -[crowd clapping]

42:10.640 --> 42:13.560
 Thank you, thank you everybody!

42:13.640 --> 42:15.280
 Can I have a photograph Ted,

42:15.360 --> 42:16.960
 and maybe an
 exclusive interview?

42:17.040 --> 42:21.480
 -Ho, ho.
 -[camera shutter clicks]

42:21.560 --> 42:22.680
 Thank you, sir.

42:22.760 --> 42:24.320
 Oh actually,
 Sergeant Livingstone

42:24.400 --> 42:27.080
 -was your St. George.
 -Managed to saved the day.

42:27.160 --> 42:30.000
 Thanks Sarge, I'll
 never forget this, ever.

42:30.080 --> 42:31.800
 And have you officers

42:31.880 --> 42:34.200
 fancy a nice of British
 sirloin for tea?

42:34.280 --> 42:35.440
 You know where to come.

42:35.520 --> 42:37.480
 -Much appreciated Ted.
 -[Ted chuckles]

42:37.560 --> 42:40.400
 However I'm afraid,
 the manual of guidance

42:40.480 --> 42:43.480
 prohibits police officers from
 accepting unsolicited gifts,

42:43.560 --> 42:46.000
 even from satisfied
 members of the public.

42:46.080 --> 42:47.320
 -Say no no more,
 -[camera shutter clicks]

42:47.400 --> 42:48.640
 I don't want to get in
 trouble on my shift.

42:48.720 --> 42:50.640
 Come in for the
 photo though, hey!

42:50.720 --> 42:55.480
 -[soft instrumental music]
 -[camera shutter clicks]

42:56.320 --> 42:58.200
 Free sirloin for life.

42:58.280 --> 43:00.600
 The Lord giveth and the
 Lord taketh away, Sam.

43:00.680 --> 43:03.680
 [grunts] Sam.

43:03.760 --> 43:04.800
 Say marrow!

43:06.440 --> 43:09.280
 -Marrow!
