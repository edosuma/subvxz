WEBVTT

00:08.675 --> 00:10.853
Big day today, Pete.

00:12.512 --> 00:14.246
Try not to be a jerk.

00:20.987 --> 00:22.598
Sir, can you move?

00:22.622 --> 00:23.733
Oh!

00:23.757 --> 00:25.558
No, no, no, no, no! No!

00:27.294 --> 00:29.228
Ah, geez.

00:30.389 --> 00:32.067
He answer your text yet?

00:32.091 --> 00:33.835
Still MIA, ma'am.

00:33.859 --> 00:35.404
Oh, great. It's only
the most historic vote

00:35.428 --> 00:36.905
the U.N.'s taken in the last 30 years,

00:36.929 --> 00:40.142
but sure, take your time,
Mr. Ambassador.

00:40.166 --> 00:41.510
Where are we with Russia and China?

00:41.534 --> 00:42.911
Still the biggest holdouts.

00:42.935 --> 00:44.546
How much to commit to the fund,

00:44.570 --> 00:46.923
how many climate-change
refugees to take in...

00:46.947 --> 00:48.049
There he is.

00:48.050 --> 00:50.319
Good morning,
Ambassador Harriman.

00:50.343 --> 00:52.321
New York used to be
the one place in America

00:52.345 --> 00:54.523
where people knew how
to walk in crowds.

00:54.547 --> 00:57.726
No more. Thank you, cell phones.

00:57.750 --> 00:59.194
Everything okay there, Peter?

00:59.218 --> 01:00.262
Sorry, ma'am.

01:00.286 --> 01:03.765
I lost something on the way in.

01:03.789 --> 01:06.034
A lucky charm, of sorts.

01:06.058 --> 01:08.303
Think you can get your game face
on in the next few minutes?

01:08.327 --> 01:09.971
Got kind of a big day ahead of us.

01:09.995 --> 01:13.075
So, the state of play is
that China and Russia

01:13.099 --> 01:14.543
might make us wait until the chamber

01:14.567 --> 01:17.145
for the big reveal,
but if we work 'em hard enough

01:17.169 --> 01:20.248
in the consultation rooms,
I think we'll get 'em to yes.

01:20.272 --> 01:21.783
And since nothing
less than the survival

01:21.807 --> 01:23.919
of a cohesive human society

01:23.943 --> 01:26.188
in the face of
catastrophic climate change

01:26.212 --> 01:28.223
is at stake, we damn well better.

01:28.247 --> 01:30.559
There's my guy. Shall we?

01:30.583 --> 01:33.295
- Let's.
- What was this lucky charm?

01:33.319 --> 01:35.897
It was a Bobby Kennedy campaign pin.

01:35.921 --> 01:37.399
I got it when I was a kid.

01:37.423 --> 01:39.801
Oh, wow, it certainly
beats a rabbit's foot.

01:39.825 --> 01:41.970
People still have those?

01:41.994 --> 01:45.129
Seems like a super gross thing
to carry around in your pocket.

01:47.666 --> 01:49.411
So, what do you think?

01:49.435 --> 01:52.848
Nice. Very "McCord for president."

01:52.872 --> 01:54.416
- Yeah, it's fine.
- Wrong.

01:54.440 --> 01:55.951
It's terrible.

01:55.975 --> 01:58.954
The HQs for winning campaigns
aren't "nice" and "fine."

01:58.978 --> 02:01.523
They have a vibe... scrappy,

02:01.547 --> 02:02.991
indomitable, like a prizefighter's

02:03.015 --> 02:04.126
training camp in the mountains.

02:04.150 --> 02:06.995
This place... feels like
the former offices

02:07.019 --> 02:08.497
of a lobbying group that went under

02:08.520 --> 02:10.499
after playing footsie
with too many dictators.

02:10.523 --> 02:12.033
Which it is, by the way.

02:12.057 --> 02:13.668
I have something else I need
to discuss with you two.

02:13.692 --> 02:16.671
Come on, step into
what will never be my office.

02:16.695 --> 02:18.940
We need you to vet the kids.

02:18.964 --> 02:20.675
Does M-Sec know about this?

02:20.699 --> 02:22.210
Would we be here if she didn't?

02:22.234 --> 02:24.146
Look, finding out that
Carlos Morejon's son

02:24.170 --> 02:25.747
was dating, um...

02:25.771 --> 02:27.215
Help me out with the middle one.

02:27.239 --> 02:29.718
- Alison.
- Knew that.

02:29.742 --> 02:30.719
...was a wake-up call.

02:30.743 --> 02:32.187
Worked out well for us, actually.

02:32.211 --> 02:33.722
But we need to make sure
that the kids don't have

02:33.746 --> 02:37.459
any other big surprises hiding
up their gawky young sleeves.

02:37.483 --> 02:38.794
Campaigns are feeding frenzies.

02:38.818 --> 02:40.028
Sit down with each of the kids,

02:40.052 --> 02:41.830
ferret out any other potential oppo.

02:41.854 --> 02:44.599
But also, give them a sense
of what it's gonna be like

02:44.623 --> 02:46.501
to be in the hot seat. Be tough.

02:46.525 --> 02:48.203
Absolutely. We can do that.

02:48.227 --> 02:49.504
Can we, though?

02:49.528 --> 02:50.505
What's that supposed to mean?

02:50.529 --> 02:52.407
I can be tough. Can you?

02:52.431 --> 02:54.142
Yes, of course I can be tough.

02:54.166 --> 02:55.811
I'm just saying, you like to be liked,

02:55.835 --> 02:57.145
especially by the McCords.

02:57.169 --> 02:59.548
I just really don't want to be
the only bad cop on this.

02:59.572 --> 03:02.184
Guys, the important thing is
that I'm bored now,

03:02.208 --> 03:03.919
so work this out somewhere else.

03:03.943 --> 03:05.510
Get back to me ASAP.

03:07.513 --> 03:09.691
The woman of the hour.

03:09.715 --> 03:12.661
Thank you, thank you.

03:12.685 --> 03:13.829
Well done, Bess.

03:13.853 --> 03:15.130
Thank you, sir.

03:15.154 --> 03:17.899
Still don't know how you got
Russia and China on board.

03:17.923 --> 03:20.502
Honestly, neither do I.

03:20.526 --> 03:23.839
The day is basically a blur.

03:23.863 --> 03:25.106
Well, take a breath.

03:25.130 --> 03:27.375
Savor your achievement.

03:27.399 --> 03:30.612
The unspoken caveat being,
before the real work starts,

03:30.636 --> 03:32.614
we have to try and get
this thing through the Senate.

03:32.638 --> 03:33.915
You've taken us this far.

03:33.939 --> 03:35.350
Let us worry about the Senate.

03:35.374 --> 03:36.852
End your tenure
at State on a high note

03:36.876 --> 03:40.388
that you can parlay into
your presidential announcement.

03:40.412 --> 03:43.091
I'm happy to testify to the
Foreign Relations Committee.

03:43.115 --> 03:45.627
And let Owen Callister
use his position as chair

03:45.651 --> 03:48.129
to beat you up right
before you announce?

03:48.153 --> 03:50.799
No way. Don't give
his campaign that ammo.

03:50.823 --> 03:53.001
Bess, I don't have to
tell you what a tough slog it is

03:53.025 --> 03:55.237
getting any treaty through
the Senate these days.

03:55.261 --> 03:56.538
This one in particular.

03:56.562 --> 03:58.206
The whip count's extremely tight.

03:58.230 --> 04:01.209
We lose just one or two senators,

04:01.233 --> 04:02.967
and we might not have the votes.

04:03.030 --> 04:05.264
So let me help you get them.

04:08.769 --> 04:10.136
Okay.

04:12.106 --> 04:14.851
Never met a politician
so willing to make it easier

04:14.875 --> 04:16.586
to make running for president harder.

04:16.610 --> 04:18.321
Well, I'm gonna take that
as a compliment.

04:18.345 --> 04:19.990
I think. Good night, sir.

04:20.014 --> 04:22.125
Speaking of, have you decided
when you're going to

04:22.149 --> 04:24.094
officially announce your resignation?

04:24.118 --> 04:27.731
I, uh... I don't know how much
longer I can keep it quiet.

04:27.755 --> 04:29.956
Actually, I was thinking
first thing tomorrow morning.

04:31.458 --> 04:32.502
Fair enough.

04:32.526 --> 04:34.537
If you happen to change your mind

04:34.561 --> 04:36.239
between now and then,

04:36.263 --> 04:38.875
I'm happy to tear it up.

04:38.899 --> 04:40.600
Can always use you in the fight.

04:42.102 --> 04:45.115
I'll keep that in mind, sir.

04:52.346 --> 04:55.392
So? Did you tell POTUS
your plans for tomorrow?

04:55.416 --> 04:57.694
I did.

04:57.718 --> 05:00.130
I still just...

05:00.154 --> 05:01.831
I can't believe it's happening.

05:01.855 --> 05:03.099
- Okay...
- Not really.

05:03.123 --> 05:05.135
Maybe this will make it
a little more real.

05:05.159 --> 05:07.671
The post-resignation,
pre-presidential announcement

05:07.695 --> 05:09.472
- vacation is officially on.
- You booked it!

05:09.496 --> 05:11.141
- Anguilla, baby, ten days.
- Oh...

05:11.165 --> 05:13.076
- Just you and me sleeping in...
- Oh...

05:13.100 --> 05:14.377
...reading books,
drinking out of coconuts.

05:14.401 --> 05:15.879
Quiet. Scuba diving.

05:15.903 --> 05:18.048
Sure. That, too.

05:18.072 --> 05:19.449
You're not gonna
get certified, are you?

05:19.473 --> 05:21.351
Maybe when we're down there.

05:21.375 --> 05:24.287
After all these years,

05:24.311 --> 05:26.389
I cannot believe you will
not do this with me.

05:26.413 --> 05:27.624
I just don't think that people

05:27.648 --> 05:29.459
were meant to breathe underwater.

05:29.483 --> 05:31.861
Well, they weren't meant to
jump out of planes, either,

05:31.885 --> 05:33.663
and you've done that plenty of times.

05:33.687 --> 05:37.924
Counterpoint: the ocean is just
one big fish toilet.

05:39.660 --> 05:41.260
Henry...

05:43.731 --> 05:47.811
We have been going flat-out for
the past four years straight.

05:47.835 --> 05:49.412
Next year we'll be campaigning.

05:49.436 --> 05:51.781
And then, if we're lucky,

05:51.805 --> 05:53.550
we'll be right back in this building

05:53.574 --> 05:55.418
for the next four to eight years.

05:55.442 --> 05:58.588
We may never know silence again
until we're in the grave.

05:58.612 --> 06:02.425
Please, join me

06:02.449 --> 06:07.797
in the profound, serene beauty
of the fish toilet.

06:07.821 --> 06:09.989
Well, when you put it that way...

06:13.527 --> 06:17.140
So, Jason, some of your
political posts online

06:17.164 --> 06:18.675
are a little edgy.

06:18.699 --> 06:20.009
You think maybe you
could tone 'em down,

06:20.033 --> 06:22.245
or maybe delete a few?

06:22.269 --> 06:23.680
For your mom.

06:23.704 --> 06:25.705
Nope. No way.

06:27.541 --> 06:29.285
Hello. First Amendment.

06:29.309 --> 06:32.322
He makes a good point.

06:32.346 --> 06:33.857
Oh.

06:33.881 --> 06:36.693
How much marijuana would you
say you, uh, smoked, Alison?

06:36.717 --> 06:38.361
Ew. None.

06:38.385 --> 06:42.365
I eat it. Duh.

06:42.389 --> 06:44.300
It's, like, totally legal here now.

06:44.324 --> 06:46.870
Well, she's right. It is mostly legal.

06:46.894 --> 06:48.594
It's legal here. Oh.

06:50.731 --> 06:52.575
Oh.

06:52.599 --> 06:54.978
Stevie, a potential concern
for the campaign

06:55.002 --> 06:56.846
is your dating history.

06:58.472 --> 06:59.616
What about it?

06:59.640 --> 07:01.684
Uh, Arthur Gilroy,
that was your former boss.

07:01.708 --> 07:03.686
That was the one that
worked for your mom.

07:03.710 --> 07:05.088
Oh, this is the one that was
twice-twice your age.

07:05.112 --> 07:06.456
- Mm-hmm.
- And then, of course,

07:06.480 --> 07:08.725
we all know about your little
moment with the president's son,

07:08.749 --> 07:11.127
and, of course, his little
moment with heroin.

07:11.151 --> 07:14.898
Oh, can't forget about
your fiancé, the English fella

07:14.922 --> 07:17.300
you left on the, on the
way to the altar... brutal.

07:17.324 --> 07:19.502
Either way, you understand
how these things

07:19.526 --> 07:21.404
could probably be

07:21.428 --> 07:24.073
problematic to your-your
mother's campaign?

07:24.097 --> 07:26.576
Right.

07:26.600 --> 07:28.945
It's actually funny,
'cause you guys don't even...

07:28.969 --> 07:30.580
Well, you don't even have
the security clearance

07:30.604 --> 07:34.551
to know about-about, uh,
"Stevie's greatest mistake."

07:34.575 --> 07:36.452
- I'm sorry, and who... - Oh, could
you tell us a little bit about that?

07:36.476 --> 07:38.454
Oh, sorry, you-you
would have to ask the FBI.

07:38.478 --> 07:42.058
By the way, they know about
everyone that you just mentioned.

07:42.082 --> 07:44.527
And, uh, they still cleared me
to work in the White House,

07:44.551 --> 07:48.565
where I handle with great
professionalism materials

07:48.589 --> 07:51.868
related to all sorts
of important issues.

07:51.892 --> 07:54.704
For example, tonight
I'm compiling a briefing book

07:54.728 --> 07:58.808
on the Climate Migration Treaty,
which paints a portrait

07:58.832 --> 08:00.877
of our future on this planet

08:00.901 --> 08:03.213
that is existentially terrifying.

08:03.237 --> 08:05.982
And so, I'm just wondering
what we are doing here

08:06.006 --> 08:10.854
worrying about how some,
what, hypothetical swing voter

08:10.878 --> 08:13.446
is maybe gonna slut-shame
a millennial?

08:16.783 --> 08:17.760
Is there anything else?

08:17.784 --> 08:19.529
- No, that's it.
- No. That's fine.

08:19.553 --> 08:20.753
- Awesome.
- Thank you.

08:25.559 --> 08:27.637
What the hell did you do?

08:27.661 --> 08:29.962
Bad cop?

08:32.499 --> 08:36.078
- Are you ready, ma'am?
- Yeah.

08:36.102 --> 08:38.248
Best job I ever had.

08:38.272 --> 08:40.239
So far.

08:44.478 --> 08:46.812
Excuse me.

08:49.082 --> 08:52.128
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

08:52.152 --> 08:55.598
A few days ago, I offered,
and President Dalton accepted

08:55.622 --> 08:57.200
my resignation as Secretary of State.

09:00.027 --> 09:03.206
Effective two weeks from today.

09:03.230 --> 09:10.145
Subtitle sync and corrections by

09:13.121 --> 09:14.298
Madam Secretary,

09:14.322 --> 09:17.968
this treaty flings
open our nation's doors

09:17.992 --> 09:20.270
to hordes of unvetted refugees

09:20.294 --> 09:22.673
who would undermine both our economy

09:22.697 --> 09:24.074
and our national security.

09:24.098 --> 09:25.943
What do you say
to the American citizen

09:25.967 --> 09:29.513
who will have his job stolen
or her life taken

09:29.537 --> 09:31.782
- by these migrants?
- Senator Callister,

09:31.806 --> 09:36.887
I would say that you're
conjuring hypothetical people

09:36.911 --> 09:40.758
in order to distract real people
from a real issue.

09:42.583 --> 09:46.263
- This is no laughing matter.
- I agree.

09:46.287 --> 09:49.800
Ratifying this treaty
to help manage the disruptions

09:49.824 --> 09:52.035
caused by climate change

09:52.059 --> 09:54.705
could not be a more serious task.

09:54.729 --> 10:00.544
I urge you and your colleagues
to act with haste.

10:00.568 --> 10:02.246
You didn't answer my question.

10:02.270 --> 10:03.881
Yes.

10:03.905 --> 10:07.384
Our nation's vetting process

10:07.408 --> 10:10.420
is already extremely stringent.

10:10.444 --> 10:13.991
In fact, not a single act of terrorism

10:14.015 --> 10:16.560
has been perpetrated in the
United States by a refugee.

10:16.584 --> 10:21.131
Cold comfort to the families
of the victims, I expect.

10:21.155 --> 10:25.102
I expect actual Americans
to be comforted by facts.

10:25.126 --> 10:29.339
The chair recognizes the
gentleman from New Hampshire,

10:29.363 --> 10:31.809
Senator Eckstad.

10:31.833 --> 10:34.244
Thank you, Mr. Chairman.

10:34.268 --> 10:37.347
Madam Secretary,
I'd first like to thank you

10:37.371 --> 10:39.750
for your service to our nation.
I'm sorry to see you go.

10:39.774 --> 10:41.084
Thank you.

10:41.108 --> 10:43.020
I also salute the hard work
that you have done

10:43.044 --> 10:44.988
to advance
the Climate Migration Treaty.

10:45.012 --> 10:46.490
I appreciate that.

10:46.514 --> 10:50.360
But while many of its aims
are worthy, my concern is

10:50.384 --> 10:53.697
why does the most extensive
treaty on climate change

10:53.721 --> 10:57.557
that the world has ever seen
do nothing about climate change?

10:59.227 --> 11:00.871
I-I'm sorry. I'm...

11:00.895 --> 11:02.372
The treaty does nothing

11:02.396 --> 11:05.275
to address the causes
of climate change,

11:05.299 --> 11:07.444
namely, dependence on fossil fuels.

11:07.468 --> 11:09.046
Senator, I agree,

11:09.070 --> 11:13.650
there are indeed many facets to
the problem of climate change.

11:13.674 --> 11:17.454
This treaty focuses on what I
believe to be the most pressing:

11:17.478 --> 11:21.692
protecting American security
and saving human lives.

11:21.716 --> 11:24.328
And I believe you're too focused
on symptoms,

11:24.352 --> 11:26.720
and not on the underlying sickness.

11:28.623 --> 11:31.068
I'm inclined to vote against
advancing it to the full Senate.

11:31.092 --> 11:33.237
And on that note,

11:33.261 --> 11:35.038
this hearing is adjourned for the day.

11:35.062 --> 11:36.607
Thank you, Madam Secretary.

11:37.798 --> 11:40.444
Well, that took a turn.

11:40.468 --> 11:42.312
I'll skip the "I told you so's."

11:42.336 --> 11:44.014
Technically, you didn't.

11:44.038 --> 11:46.884
So do we think that, uh,
Eckstad's for real,

11:46.908 --> 11:48.485
- or is he just grandstanding?
- I don't know.

11:48.509 --> 11:50.387
But if he takes
the rest of his groovy friends

11:50.411 --> 11:53.123
in the Rainbows and Moonbeams
Caucus with him,

11:53.147 --> 11:54.925
we're not gonna get to two-thirds.

11:54.949 --> 11:56.660
I think he's a showboat,
but he wants to deal.

11:56.684 --> 11:57.995
I'm gonna go see what he's angling for

11:58.019 --> 11:59.196
and I'll circle back.

11:59.220 --> 12:01.932
Well, that's our only chance. Be nice.

12:01.956 --> 12:04.182
Stevie, I just wanted to say
I-I'm sorry for last night.

12:04.183 --> 12:04.913
It's fine.

12:04.914 --> 12:06.153
It's just, Daisy always
calls me Mr. Nice Guy.

12:06.154 --> 12:07.337
I was, you know, trying not to...

12:07.361 --> 12:08.839
You know what, just buy me
a drink and we're cool.

12:08.863 --> 12:10.073
- Okay? I have to go.
- Okay.

12:10.097 --> 12:11.608
Well, I admire your principles.

12:11.632 --> 12:14.814
My problem is this treaty just
doesn't deal with root causes.

12:14.815 --> 12:18.195
Yeah. Y-You mentioned that earlier.

12:18.219 --> 12:20.797
I have a, uh,
corporate carbon tax bill

12:20.821 --> 12:22.799
that will do just that.

12:22.823 --> 12:25.836
But it's stuck in committee over
at Energy and Natural Resources.

12:25.860 --> 12:28.171
But POTUS is friends

12:28.195 --> 12:29.806
with the chairman.

12:29.830 --> 12:32.476
So the White House gets
your bill out of committee,

12:32.500 --> 12:34.144
you get ours out.

12:34.168 --> 12:35.979
That about the size of it?

12:36.003 --> 12:41.285
I always say, my most important
constituent is Mother Earth.

12:41.309 --> 12:43.287
And that's really neat.

12:43.311 --> 12:45.355
Senator, your bill
is stuck in committee

12:45.379 --> 12:46.890
because it's half-baked.

12:46.914 --> 12:48.892
You want to make real change?

12:48.916 --> 12:52.396
Do your homework,
get the details right.

12:52.420 --> 12:54.698
I'd hoped for a more
productive discussion.

12:54.722 --> 12:58.101
No, you hoped for a grubby
little quid pro quo.

12:58.125 --> 13:01.004
This treaty is humankind's
last, best shot

13:01.028 --> 13:02.506
to save itself from the disruptions

13:02.530 --> 13:04.675
that mass migrations will cause.

13:04.699 --> 13:08.011
And if it dies in the Senate
because of you,

13:08.035 --> 13:11.515
well, I am gonna be spending
some time soon

13:11.539 --> 13:13.183
in your home state,

13:13.207 --> 13:15.852
and I will make it a point
to remind your progressive base

13:15.876 --> 13:18.445
just who to blame.

13:19.947 --> 13:22.492
Thank you for your time, Senator.

13:22.516 --> 13:24.361
Why'd I have to get so mad?

13:24.385 --> 13:27.164
Russell said, "Be nice,
we need this guy."

13:27.188 --> 13:29.066
"Physician, heal thyself," Russell.

13:29.090 --> 13:30.400
Whoa, I think I really blew this.

13:30.424 --> 13:31.868
Don't beat yourself up, babe.

13:31.892 --> 13:33.904
If your gut was telling you
not to cave,

13:33.928 --> 13:35.572
then you're probably right.

13:35.596 --> 13:37.274
Interesting,

13:37.298 --> 13:42.546
'cause my gut is also telling me
that you've made no plans

13:42.570 --> 13:45.048
- to get scuba-certified.
- Not true.

13:45.072 --> 13:47.384
I have been reviewing relevant materials.

13:47.408 --> 13:49.786
- Reviewing relevant material?
- Yeah, I saw a video

13:49.810 --> 13:51.955
of this guy diving over a coral reef

13:51.979 --> 13:54.691
and an eel came out and bit him,
right on his...

13:54.715 --> 13:56.516
Hey, Russell.

13:58.486 --> 14:00.697
Well, that's great news.
Well... I-I...

14:00.721 --> 14:02.866
Thank you for the call.

14:04.158 --> 14:06.569
Eckstad blinked. We got the votes.

14:06.570 --> 14:08.572
- The treaty's gonna pass.
- I told you.

14:08.596 --> 14:10.073
- Congratulations, honey.
- Oh.

14:10.097 --> 14:12.075
You really did something incredible.

14:12.099 --> 14:13.744
Well, time will tell.

14:13.768 --> 14:16.813
But it does really feel like
I deserve something in return,

14:16.837 --> 14:18.715
- doesn't it?
- Like what?

14:18.739 --> 14:22.819
What is your problem
with scuba diving?

14:22.843 --> 14:25.589
I'm scared.

14:25.613 --> 14:29.493
Sweetheart.

14:29.517 --> 14:31.795
- Get over it.
- I'll get... I will.

14:31.819 --> 14:34.197
- Okay. Good. - I'm gonna get
certified before we go on the trip.

14:34.221 --> 14:35.532
Because you are gonna love it.

14:35.556 --> 14:38.668
Yeah. That's what
Eel Guy thought, too.

14:38.692 --> 14:40.837
By the way, I-I'm totally with you

14:40.861 --> 14:43.273
with the whole climate change dread.

14:43.297 --> 14:44.674
Thank you. I am, like,

14:44.698 --> 14:47.744
reading these reports, like, I...
I mean, I cannot be the only one

14:47.768 --> 14:48.749
Mm-mm.

14:48.750 --> 14:49.913
who's legitimately having
nightmares about this stuff.

14:49.937 --> 14:51.681
Oh, no, no, no. No, you have
no idea. There were...

14:51.705 --> 14:53.350
I-I read this one report
a few years ago,

14:53.374 --> 14:55.452
it was like, where the world
will be in 2030,

14:55.476 --> 14:57.454
and I had a total freak-out.

14:57.478 --> 15:00.090
- Mm-hmm.
- I mean, full-on meltdown, completely.

15:00.114 --> 15:02.426
There was this, there was
this one statistic about...

15:02.450 --> 15:04.327
Flamingos.

15:04.351 --> 15:05.495
- You know about this?
- Right... I do, yeah.

15:05.519 --> 15:07.322
- There's more plastic ones than real...
- Yes.

15:07.346 --> 15:08.665
Than real ones, yeah,
I know because my mom

15:08.689 --> 15:10.667
told me how much
you freaked out about it.

15:10.691 --> 15:13.270
No! Oh, come on.

15:13.294 --> 15:14.604
I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

15:14.628 --> 15:16.840
- I'm sorry.
- That is very, very mortifying.

15:18.199 --> 15:19.643
- Here you go.
- Oh, thanks.

15:19.667 --> 15:21.311
What... no, no, no, no.

15:21.335 --> 15:23.246
- Please... Blake.
- No, no. Please.

15:23.270 --> 15:26.172
I was a total ass, I
owe you drinks forever.

15:27.641 --> 15:29.119
Friends?

15:29.143 --> 15:31.121
Friends.

15:31.145 --> 15:32.956
So, uh,
the world is ending,

15:32.980 --> 15:34.958
and we're all screwed.

15:34.982 --> 15:36.760
Which we've established.

15:36.784 --> 15:38.762
Yeah. So what do you do?

15:38.786 --> 15:42.933
Like, what's the one thing
that you would want to do

15:42.957 --> 15:46.069
before, you know, it all collapses?

15:46.093 --> 15:48.271
Oh. How much time do I have left?

15:48.295 --> 15:50.607
However much you want. Don't
get hung up on the details.

15:50.631 --> 15:52.642
Okay. I don't know, sing more?

15:52.666 --> 15:56.079
Oh, maybe I'll do one of those
TV singing competitions.

15:56.103 --> 15:57.914
- Really?
- I don't know.

15:57.938 --> 15:59.583
Maybe. That's cool.

15:59.607 --> 16:02.652
Well, I don't know. What about you?

16:02.676 --> 16:05.655
I would spend every waking
moment with my loved ones,

16:05.679 --> 16:07.190
- you monster.
- Boo.

16:07.214 --> 16:08.602
No, come on, seriously.
What would you do?

16:08.626 --> 16:13.563
I don't know. That's the thing,
it's like, life is so...

16:13.587 --> 16:15.232
uh, beautiful and it's short.

16:15.256 --> 16:18.101
Half the time, I just want
to drop everything and, like,

16:18.125 --> 16:20.937
go out and experience
as much of it as I can

16:20.961 --> 16:24.040
before it's all gone, or I am.

16:24.064 --> 16:26.016
It's a good thing the
world's not ending.

16:26.040 --> 16:27.190
Mm.

16:29.000 --> 16:35.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

16:44.285 --> 16:45.929
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

16:45.953 --> 16:48.064
S... We can't do this.

16:48.088 --> 16:50.867
- No, no. Um...
- No. It's...

16:50.891 --> 16:52.536
That's not... I... sorry.

16:52.560 --> 16:54.371
- No, no, it's fine. It's...
- That's not what...

16:54.395 --> 16:55.539
I shouldn't have done that.

16:55.563 --> 16:57.774
I thought that you were...

16:57.798 --> 16:59.706
- Are you...? Aren't you...?
- I'm bi.

16:59.707 --> 17:00.533
Not that that is not...

17:00.557 --> 17:01.995
No, no, no, I didn't... that's
not what I was saying.

17:02.002 --> 17:03.146
I... that was not... Yeah.

17:03.170 --> 17:05.015
Uh, it was fine. Yes, great.

17:05.039 --> 17:07.751
But, um, we can't do this.

17:07.775 --> 17:09.886
- No. No, no, no.
- No. Okay.

17:09.910 --> 17:11.320
Should we be freaking out right now?

17:11.345 --> 17:13.223
- No. No, no, no. It's just a thing.
- Okay.

17:13.247 --> 17:14.657
- It just happened.
- Great. Just happens.

17:14.682 --> 17:16.159
- Just happened.
- Done. Done.

17:16.183 --> 17:17.327
- Great.
- Good night.

17:17.351 --> 17:18.984
Good night.

17:19.987 --> 17:21.665
Uh...

17:21.689 --> 17:23.333
Promise you won't freak out.

17:23.357 --> 17:24.467
- I promise.
- Okay.

17:24.491 --> 17:26.136
All right.

17:26.160 --> 17:28.410
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

17:29.101 --> 17:30.744
- That's it.
- All right. Oh.

17:30.768 --> 17:34.538
Before you go to Geneva...
I almost forgot...

17:34.539 --> 17:36.717
got you a little something.

17:37.909 --> 17:41.561
Oh. Will you look at that?

17:41.562 --> 17:43.707
You know, I called the city,
I had a whole crew of people

17:43.731 --> 17:48.404
down there looking for my pin,
but no luck.

17:48.405 --> 17:50.383
Well, hold on tight to that one.

17:50.407 --> 17:51.884
I will.

17:51.908 --> 17:54.821
You know, I got the last one in 1968.

17:54.845 --> 17:56.689
- No kidding.
- Yeah.

17:56.713 --> 17:59.258
Man, in '68, my dad and I
weren't seeing eye to eye

17:59.282 --> 18:01.594
on anything, least of all Vietnam.

18:01.618 --> 18:04.731
But when Bobby Kennedy
came to town to campaign,

18:04.755 --> 18:07.233
my dad took a shift off work,
got me out of school

18:07.257 --> 18:10.536
to go see him. I got in the car
and he handed me one of these.

18:10.560 --> 18:12.638
I saw he was wearing one,
so I put it on.

18:12.662 --> 18:14.407
We finally get there, and, uh,

18:14.431 --> 18:16.709
there's this huge crowd
of people. Black,

18:16.733 --> 18:18.978
white, men, women, young, old.

18:19.002 --> 18:23.282
Anyway, uh, the amazing thing was,

18:23.306 --> 18:26.986
it seemed like Bobby was
speaking to each one of us.

18:27.010 --> 18:31.357
You could see that he was just
putting it right out there,

18:31.381 --> 18:32.892
putting his whole soul into it.

18:32.916 --> 18:37.263
I mean, to win, sure,
but more importantly,

18:37.287 --> 18:40.600
he was telling America
the truth as he saw it.

18:40.624 --> 18:43.035
"We ought to get
out of Vietnam." I cheered.

18:43.059 --> 18:45.304
"We got to end
student draft deferments

18:45.328 --> 18:47.440
so that everyone could
sacrifice equally."

18:47.464 --> 18:48.941
My dad cheered.

18:48.965 --> 18:50.910
And I thought, "If this guy can bring

18:50.934 --> 18:53.079
"me and my old man together, then...

18:53.103 --> 18:56.115
The country
ought to be a cinch."

18:56.139 --> 18:58.718
That was Bobby.

19:00.076 --> 19:02.455
So when the nonsense
starts to weigh me down,

19:02.479 --> 19:04.791
it reminds me why
I got into this crazy

19:04.815 --> 19:06.959
line of work to begin with.

19:06.983 --> 19:09.162
Thank you so much. I'll cherish it.

19:09.186 --> 19:11.664
Good luck in Geneva, Peter.

19:11.688 --> 19:13.866
And you stay on top
of China and Russia,

19:13.890 --> 19:15.701
hold them to their commitment,
all right?

19:15.725 --> 19:17.370
Will do.

19:17.394 --> 19:19.697
I understand that, uh, you may
make an announcement soon.

19:19.721 --> 19:20.797
Ah...

19:20.798 --> 19:23.443
Could you just indulge
me, just for a moment?

19:23.467 --> 19:26.078
Forget about party politics...

19:26.102 --> 19:28.881
liberals, conservatives, all that.

19:28.905 --> 19:31.184
What America yearns for

19:31.208 --> 19:34.220
is a leader with the integrity
to tell the truth

19:34.244 --> 19:37.723
and the charisma to make people listen

19:37.747 --> 19:40.182
and the guts to act on it.

19:41.184 --> 19:43.563
That's a tall order.

19:43.587 --> 19:45.287
Not for you, ma'am.

19:46.289 --> 19:48.267
Thank you, Peter.

19:48.291 --> 19:50.326
Bye, now.

19:52.529 --> 19:54.507
So it sounds like
there are no major red flags

19:54.531 --> 19:56.175
with the McCord kids,
with the possible exception

19:56.199 --> 19:58.836
of Stevie's checkered dating
history, which we can manage.

19:58.837 --> 19:59.801
Great.

19:59.802 --> 20:01.697
- I mean, "checkered" is a pretty
strong word, don't you think?

20:01.698 --> 20:04.317
What would you prefer?
Erratic? Irregular?

20:04.341 --> 20:05.651
Vicissitudinous?

20:05.675 --> 20:07.926
Why are we worrying
so much when Stevie's

20:07.927 --> 20:09.237
an asset to the campaign?

20:09.261 --> 20:11.039
She's dynamic, smart,

20:11.063 --> 20:13.341
relatable to young voters,
and... oh, yeah... a survivor

20:13.365 --> 20:15.677
of the White House attack,
which makes her a hero.

20:15.701 --> 20:17.679
I mean, w-what are we talking
about here, people?

20:17.703 --> 20:19.848
- You tell me, man.
- I... easy, tiger.

20:19.872 --> 20:21.349
I'm-I'm with you.

20:21.373 --> 20:23.118
Not dying in the White House
buys her at least

20:23.142 --> 20:25.022
a couple of loser boyfriends.
Meeting adjourned.

20:25.978 --> 20:27.722
Um...

20:27.746 --> 20:29.891
- I'll meet you back at the office, okay?
- Sure.

20:29.915 --> 20:32.761
Oh, and by the way,
I know you're going for scrappy,

20:32.785 --> 20:35.263
but this is a little too scrappy.

20:35.287 --> 20:36.398
Right? I think someone's
actually living

20:36.422 --> 20:37.732
in the supply closet.

20:37.756 --> 20:41.536
Mike, in the interest
of full disclosure...

20:41.560 --> 20:43.705
Oh, boy, awkward confession theater.

20:43.729 --> 20:46.908
Stephanie and I... Who's Stephanie?

20:46.932 --> 20:49.311
Stevie. McCord.

20:49.335 --> 20:51.313
Oh, wow. Really?

20:51.337 --> 20:53.982
I feel I owe a-a duty to
the campaign to report

20:54.006 --> 20:56.841
that we... had contact.

21:00.980 --> 21:02.324
Contact?

21:02.348 --> 21:05.093
We kissed... once.

21:05.117 --> 21:06.828
And we both agree,
it'll never happen again.

21:06.852 --> 21:08.997
That's great,
you just lost us Florida.

21:09.021 --> 21:11.266
Oh, no...

21:11.290 --> 21:13.368
Dude, I'm kidding. What is this,

21:13.392 --> 21:14.903
middle school? It's fine.

21:14.927 --> 21:16.638
Surprising, I'll admit.

21:16.662 --> 21:18.406
But... it's fine.

21:18.430 --> 21:20.041
- It's not a problem for the campaign?
- No.

21:20.065 --> 21:21.943
Go forth and sin no more. Or sin.

21:21.967 --> 21:24.546
Honestly, nobody cares.
I got to take this.

21:24.570 --> 21:27.205
Hey. How do you feel
about tacos for dinner?

21:29.908 --> 21:32.120
Well, at least we'll get one meal

21:32.144 --> 21:33.488
we actually enjoy this week.

21:33.512 --> 21:35.090
- Hmm.
- Eh, Yeric?

21:35.114 --> 21:37.058
It's cafeteria food
and rubber chicken banquets

21:37.082 --> 21:38.960
- from here on out.
- Oh.

21:38.984 --> 21:40.895
Yeah.

21:40.919 --> 21:44.199
Well, I guess we
better start the toast

21:44.223 --> 21:46.357
or we'll never get home.

21:54.299 --> 21:55.910
Are you okay?

21:55.934 --> 21:58.713
Peter, are you all right?

21:58.737 --> 22:02.250
You're bleeding.

22:14.820 --> 22:17.932
We...

22:17.956 --> 22:20.925
have to get out of here.

22:59.774 --> 23:01.403
The Swiss police
have a high degree

23:01.404 --> 23:03.256
of confidence the chemical
agent was sarin.

23:03.257 --> 23:06.069
Colorless, odorless, highly soluble.

23:06.093 --> 23:09.243
The entire U.N. Security
Council just... gone?

23:09.244 --> 23:11.322
What... I mean, what the
hell do we do now, ma'am?

23:11.346 --> 23:13.691
It's been reported
that Ambassador Harriman...

23:13.715 --> 23:16.361
We get to the White House
and get in the fight.

23:16.385 --> 23:17.795
...by a chemical weapon...

23:17.819 --> 23:19.864
We're getting reports
that a white nationalist group

23:19.888 --> 23:21.099
has claimed responsibility.

23:21.123 --> 23:22.834
They are threatening
attacks on any country

23:22.858 --> 23:25.036
that honors its commitments
to accept refugees.

23:25.060 --> 23:27.272
Okay. We need to reach out to our
partners and allies ASAP.

23:27.273 --> 23:28.549
We'll have our work cut out for us.

23:28.573 --> 23:29.593
France is already getting wobbly.

23:29.594 --> 23:30.904
Call the foreign minister's
office while I'm in

23:30.928 --> 23:33.440
with POTUS,
try and talk them off the ledge.

23:33.464 --> 23:36.144
What do we know about this group,

23:36.145 --> 23:38.657
"The Knights of Western Freedom,"

23:38.681 --> 23:41.026
or whatever these monsters
are calling themselves?

23:41.050 --> 23:43.194
Well, Agent Maloof from
our Counterterrorism Division

23:43.218 --> 23:44.996
will take you through
what we know so far.

23:45.020 --> 23:47.165
Mr. President, based on a communiqué

23:47.189 --> 23:48.933
the group posted today,

23:48.957 --> 23:50.869
The Knights of Western Freedom

23:50.893 --> 23:53.038
claims to be
an informal network of cells

23:53.062 --> 23:56.775
paradoxically united by
a resistance to what they call

23:56.799 --> 23:58.877
"the globalist conspiracy."

23:58.901 --> 24:02.180
They see the migration treaty
as an attempt to undermine

24:02.204 --> 24:03.748
national sovereignty and so-called

24:03.772 --> 24:05.450
- "ethnic purity."
- So we're looking at

24:05.474 --> 24:08.153
active cells in multiple countries?

24:08.177 --> 24:09.721
They managed to access

24:09.745 --> 24:12.290
sarin and place two inside men

24:12.314 --> 24:14.759
at a U.N. Security Council meeting.

24:14.783 --> 24:16.628
So we have to assume
they're formidable.

24:16.652 --> 24:18.930
Elizabeth, is
it safe to say that our

24:18.954 --> 24:21.466
allies and friends
will unify against this attack?

24:21.490 --> 24:24.102
Early indications are that
it's having the opposite effect.

24:24.126 --> 24:25.370
Many European governments were

24:25.394 --> 24:26.738
already afraid of their right flank.

24:26.762 --> 24:28.940
This attack is forcing
a choice on them.

24:28.964 --> 24:30.809
Abandon their international
commitments,

24:30.833 --> 24:33.111
or risk more attacks
and getting voted out.

24:33.135 --> 24:34.446
Russell, tell Comms

24:34.470 --> 24:35.947
I'm going to address
the nation tonight.

24:35.971 --> 24:37.582
The American people
need to know that we're

24:37.606 --> 24:39.150
directing all resources

24:39.174 --> 24:40.785
to stepping up security and...

24:40.809 --> 24:43.131
hunting these sons of bitches down.

24:43.132 --> 24:45.778
Frank, Ephraim, I want Intel
briefings every two hours.

24:45.802 --> 24:47.780
Bess, get with our allies.

24:47.804 --> 24:50.382
Tell them we can offer
every resource they need

24:50.406 --> 24:52.384
to disrupt this network and push back

24:52.408 --> 24:54.920
on this hateful ideology. Understood?

24:54.944 --> 24:56.922
- Yes, Mr. President.
- Thank you.

24:56.946 --> 24:58.057
How did the call

24:58.081 --> 24:59.725
- with France go?
- Not great.

24:59.749 --> 25:02.161
Beauvais is talking
about suspending France's

25:02.185 --> 25:04.096
- participation in the treaty.
- She knows that's not

25:04.120 --> 25:06.832
how treaties work, right?
And you made it... clear

25:06.856 --> 25:09.168
- that we are with them all the way?
- Yeah, the thing is,

25:09.192 --> 25:10.569
they're not sure that we are.

25:10.593 --> 25:12.871
- What does...?
- Ca-Callister released a statement.

25:12.895 --> 25:15.741
Uh, he's blaming the attack on
"globalist fantasies

25:15.765 --> 25:17.509
"that average citizens
around the world don't want

25:17.533 --> 25:19.245
and didn't vote for."
Says his first priority

25:19.269 --> 25:21.513
as president will be to pull out
of all such agreements.

25:21.537 --> 25:22.748
Beauvais says
that she understands that

25:22.772 --> 25:24.617
of course a Dalton
or McCord administration

25:24.641 --> 25:26.552
would have France's back, but...

25:26.576 --> 25:29.644
she's highly doubtful that a
Callister administration would.

25:31.914 --> 25:33.826
So France is less worried about

25:33.850 --> 25:35.961
white nationalist terror
in their own backyard

25:35.985 --> 25:38.797
than the possibility
of a white nationalist

25:38.821 --> 25:41.166
- in the Oval Office?
- Can't say that I blame them entirely.

25:41.190 --> 25:43.736
How are we supposed
to keep other nations

25:43.760 --> 25:47.295
on board when they're not sure
they can trust our word?

26:05.982 --> 26:08.227
Nina. Listen...

26:08.251 --> 26:11.230
- did you get in touch with Peter's kids?
- Yes, ma'am, um,

26:11.254 --> 26:14.166
his son Kevin and daughter
Brooke are standing by.

26:14.190 --> 26:16.335
Great, I want to give them an update

26:16.359 --> 26:17.870
on their father's remains.

26:17.894 --> 26:19.905
- Where are we on that?
- Our embassy in Geneva

26:19.929 --> 26:21.807
has been in contact with the morgue.

26:21.831 --> 26:24.376
And they believe that
Ambassador Harriman's remains

26:24.400 --> 26:28.147
and effects can be decontaminated...

26:28.171 --> 26:31.450
and safe for transport...

26:31.474 --> 26:33.585
Very soon.

26:33.609 --> 26:35.454
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

26:35.478 --> 26:37.156
It's just ironic.

26:37.180 --> 26:39.347
I'm crying over a man who made me cry.

26:42.418 --> 26:45.331
But Ambassador Harriman
was actually...

26:45.355 --> 26:48.167
very kind to me.

26:48.191 --> 26:49.668
He taught me that us
working-class kids

26:49.692 --> 26:52.037
need to stick together.

26:52.061 --> 26:53.672
Well...

26:53.696 --> 26:55.664
he appreciated grit.

26:57.500 --> 26:59.478
That's why he liked you.

27:01.204 --> 27:03.505
Um, I'll dial his kids in
as soon as you're ready...

27:09.679 --> 27:11.713
Thank you.

27:28.297 --> 27:31.110
Konstantin, let me first say

27:31.134 --> 27:34.413
I'm truly sorry for the loss
of Ambassador Kolkin.

27:34.437 --> 27:36.037
Thank you.

27:38.007 --> 27:40.486
Yeric and I went to school together.

27:40.510 --> 27:42.755
He probably would have

27:42.779 --> 27:45.146
held this job next after me.

27:47.150 --> 27:50.629
Condolences, as well,
for the loss of Peter Harriman.

27:50.653 --> 27:52.564
Yeric and Peter.

27:52.588 --> 27:56.335
Both great diplomats and patriots.

27:56.359 --> 27:58.960
Gave their lives for this treaty.

28:01.497 --> 28:04.343
I trust Russia will honor their memory

28:04.367 --> 28:05.844
by honoring its commitment.

28:05.868 --> 28:08.814
You've seen
the demonstrations in Moscow.

28:08.838 --> 28:11.216
People are frightened

28:11.240 --> 28:13.352
and, uh, rightfully so.

28:13.376 --> 28:16.121
Is it the Russian people
who are afraid?

28:16.145 --> 28:18.323
Or the politicians?

28:18.347 --> 28:19.792
What do you mean by that?

28:19.816 --> 28:21.627
After the White House was attacked,

28:21.651 --> 28:24.263
I warned you
that Russia's signal-boosting

28:24.287 --> 28:26.999
of this kind of ideology would
come home to roost one day.

28:27.023 --> 28:29.101
What are you saying?

28:29.125 --> 28:32.104
You fed a monster and now
you've lost control of it.

28:32.128 --> 28:34.506
That you could say such a thing...

28:34.530 --> 28:37.376
after I had to consult his widow?

28:37.400 --> 28:39.011
Konstantin.

28:39.035 --> 28:41.480
We all knew... there were risks

28:41.504 --> 28:43.315
when we embarked on this treaty.

28:43.339 --> 28:47.052
But we can't let these
murderers use chaos

28:47.076 --> 28:49.354
and fear to undermine
global stability.

28:49.378 --> 28:51.490
Russia must stand up.

28:51.514 --> 28:53.459
Ironic that you decry

28:53.483 --> 28:56.295
the evils of nationalism
abroad while...

28:56.319 --> 28:57.996
Owen Callister's running
for president?

28:58.020 --> 28:59.498
- Yeah, I've heard this one.
- But,

28:59.522 --> 29:02.534
that is the problem with
your so-called...

29:02.558 --> 29:04.336
"free speech."

29:04.360 --> 29:07.172
It's just another weapon...

29:07.196 --> 29:09.541
that can be bought and sold

29:09.565 --> 29:11.666
as easily as a Kalashnikov.

29:14.770 --> 29:16.415
Excuse me...

29:16.439 --> 29:19.251
but I have a funeral to attend.

29:19.275 --> 29:21.676
Goodbye, Madam Secretary.

29:23.246 --> 29:25.257
I don't know.

29:25.281 --> 29:27.759
I may have been wrong
about this whole thing.

29:27.783 --> 29:29.862
Whatever the thing is, I doubt it.

29:29.886 --> 29:31.864
The treaty.

29:31.888 --> 29:35.067
I'm trying to create this...

29:35.091 --> 29:36.902
collective action in the face

29:36.926 --> 29:39.204
of worldwide threats.

29:39.228 --> 29:41.907
Like, the entire liberal world order?

29:41.931 --> 29:43.542
Man, you did have a rough day.

29:43.566 --> 29:45.110
I think I get it.

29:45.134 --> 29:48.614
People's lives being shaped
by these huge,

29:48.638 --> 29:50.616
remote forces that
they don't understand.

29:50.640 --> 29:53.385
Maybe Callister's
tapping into something

29:53.409 --> 29:55.320
that we ignore at our peril.

29:55.344 --> 29:58.557
For almost all our history
as a species,

29:58.581 --> 30:00.626
humans have roamed around
in small bands.

30:00.650 --> 30:03.929
Maybe we're... just not wired
to comprehend

30:03.953 --> 30:06.665
such a vast...

30:06.689 --> 30:08.467
abstract social system.

30:08.491 --> 30:11.637
When our problems become ever vaster

30:11.661 --> 30:13.972
and more abstract...
Like climate change.

30:13.996 --> 30:15.240
...people lash out.

30:15.264 --> 30:17.142
You know what else is bugging me?

30:17.166 --> 30:20.445
I get why Avdonin
brought Callister up...

30:20.469 --> 30:23.815
but he said this thing about...

30:23.839 --> 30:26.552
how... free speech was like

30:26.576 --> 30:28.253
a weapon that could
be bought and sold.

30:28.277 --> 30:30.756
I mean, it almost seemed
like he was saying

30:30.780 --> 30:32.925
Callister...

30:32.949 --> 30:35.183
had been bought and sold.

30:36.185 --> 30:38.063
Do you think that could be true?

30:38.087 --> 30:39.498
Why would Avdonin tell me?

30:39.522 --> 30:42.401
Wouldn't Russia want
leverage on Callister?

30:42.425 --> 30:45.571
Maybe they're playing a game.
Running an op on you.

30:45.595 --> 30:48.373
Undermine Americans' faith
in the system

30:48.397 --> 30:51.276
by getting me to accuse
Callister of being

30:51.300 --> 30:52.744
in Russia's pocket.

30:52.768 --> 30:54.813
But what if he is?

30:54.837 --> 30:57.382
Well, then it doesn't matter

30:57.406 --> 30:59.117
why Avdonin told me.

30:59.141 --> 31:01.186
Our democracy is at risk.

31:01.210 --> 31:03.188
Babe, I think
you got to loop in the IC.

31:03.212 --> 31:04.512
Read Ephraim in.

31:06.382 --> 31:08.938
I've never wanted to be wrong
about something this badly.

31:33.152 --> 31:35.427
- Mr. President.
- Elizabeth.

31:35.428 --> 31:38.040
What's going on? Have we caught them?

31:38.064 --> 31:40.876
- We're running down leads.
- That's a different briefing.

31:40.900 --> 31:43.902
You ready to get read in
on something tricky?

31:46.072 --> 31:49.318
I passed on your conversation
with Foreign Minister Avdonin

31:49.342 --> 31:50.452
to the FBI last night.

31:50.476 --> 31:52.588
It provided a piece to a case

31:52.612 --> 31:54.456
we've been building for some time.

31:54.480 --> 31:57.025
We have strong evidence
that Owen Callister's

31:57.049 --> 31:59.895
campaign manager, Dan Finnerty,
has been funneling money

31:59.919 --> 32:02.664
from Russian oligarchs
into Callister's super PAC.

32:02.688 --> 32:04.700
We'll be arresting him later today.

32:04.724 --> 32:06.935
Was Callister in the loop?

32:06.959 --> 32:09.338
Based on the evidence, DOJ
will announce they're opening

32:09.362 --> 32:11.039
an investigation
into the senator, too.

32:11.063 --> 32:12.341
Due to the
inherently political

32:12.365 --> 32:14.443
nature of the case,
we're concerned that Callister

32:14.467 --> 32:17.279
may cry witch hunt and come after you.

32:17.303 --> 32:18.447
Let him.

32:18.471 --> 32:19.948
He's the traitor, not me.

32:19.972 --> 32:22.284
So, now we know

32:22.308 --> 32:24.219
why so many of Callister's positions

32:24.243 --> 32:27.155
line up so conveniently
with Russia's, but...

32:27.179 --> 32:29.291
why is Avdonin selling him out?

32:29.315 --> 32:31.293
One theory is

32:31.317 --> 32:34.663
that the Russians somehow
caught wind that Callister's

32:34.687 --> 32:38.223
under suspicion, and this is
an attempt at damage control.

32:40.359 --> 32:44.564
I think he's about to attend
the funeral of a dear friend,

32:44.565 --> 32:46.810
and can see the shape
of things to come.

32:46.834 --> 32:48.812
Hopefully, this drives a stake

32:48.836 --> 32:49.846
through Callister's heart.

32:49.870 --> 32:51.381
I want you to be

32:51.405 --> 32:54.351
president, too, but that's
cold-blooded, even for me.

32:54.375 --> 32:56.353
Our treaty partners are using

32:56.377 --> 32:59.689
Callister's potential
presidency to back away.

32:59.713 --> 33:01.891
If he's gone, we get our partners back

33:01.915 --> 33:03.927
and the United States can lead again.

33:03.951 --> 33:07.697
I mean, I'll-I'll wait
until the news about

33:07.721 --> 33:08.732
the campaign manager breaks,

33:08.756 --> 33:10.333
and then I want
to make some phone calls.

33:10.357 --> 33:13.203
Thank you, Bess.

33:13.227 --> 33:16.206
After the arrest of his
campaign manager on suspicion

33:16.230 --> 33:19.909
of soliciting illegal
campaign funds from Russia,

33:19.933 --> 33:21.945
and the opening of a Justice
Department investigation

33:21.969 --> 33:24.014
into the candidate himself,

33:24.038 --> 33:27.017
Kentucky Senator Owen Callister
made a surprising announcement.

33:27.041 --> 33:29.252
This is a politically
motivated witch hunt

33:29.276 --> 33:31.388
from the Dalton administration
trying to clear the path

33:31.412 --> 33:33.589
- for Elizabeth McCord...
- Wait, hold on a second, Jay.

33:33.590 --> 33:35.091
- ...to be handed the presidency.
- Hold on.

33:35.115 --> 33:37.127
That said, I am hereby announcing

33:37.151 --> 33:39.903
I am suspending my
presidential campaign...

33:39.927 --> 33:40.864
Yeah.

33:40.888 --> 33:43.778
I have been waiting all day
to watch and savor that.

33:45.426 --> 33:48.138
Whew. America dodged a bullet.

33:48.162 --> 33:50.874
For now. Yeah.

33:50.898 --> 33:53.677
Well, let's... I mean,
yeah, it's good news.

33:53.701 --> 33:57.147
So we'll follow up
with her tomorrow, okay?

33:57.171 --> 33:58.148
Nice work, Jay.

33:58.172 --> 34:01.073
Really. Thank you. Night.

34:02.176 --> 34:04.587
Well, I guess the news

34:04.611 --> 34:07.724
of Callister's... whatever

34:07.748 --> 34:09.359
made its way back to France.

34:09.382 --> 34:12.027
Beauvais said they're back in

34:12.052 --> 34:14.297
on the treaty, so...

34:14.321 --> 34:16.266
Well, hey, that's great news.

34:16.290 --> 34:19.202
Uh, it is. It is.

34:19.226 --> 34:22.672
And yet... you're
not smiling. What...?

34:22.696 --> 34:26.275
Well, other countries
are still on the fence,

34:26.300 --> 34:28.445
including Russia, who,
whatever their reason

34:28.469 --> 34:32.649
for giving up Callister,
are still covertly backing him

34:32.672 --> 34:35.819
to influence our politics.

34:35.842 --> 34:38.987
I'm trying to get this treaty passed.

34:39.012 --> 34:41.524
Got good people like
Peter Harriman killed.

34:41.547 --> 34:44.293
And the group that did it
is still at large,

34:44.318 --> 34:46.396
and their ideology is on the march.

34:46.420 --> 34:48.864
When we should all be
working together to try

34:48.889 --> 34:52.202
and save our existence on this planet,

34:52.226 --> 34:54.637
we're getting bogged down
by petty tribalism.

34:54.661 --> 34:58.097
Politics just feels like an ugly joke.

35:01.969 --> 35:04.714
I'm going out.

35:04.738 --> 35:06.449
- Bye, sweetheart.
- Have a good time.

35:06.473 --> 35:08.007
- Have fun.
- Bye.

35:10.944 --> 35:14.724
I'm starting to look forward
to the serene quietude

35:14.748 --> 35:17.293
of the fish toilet.

35:17.317 --> 35:19.629
Yeah.

35:19.653 --> 35:21.954
Might want to wait on that.

35:23.056 --> 35:25.034
I've been thinking...

35:25.058 --> 35:27.504
- Hi.
- Hi.

35:27.528 --> 35:28.872
Sorry for the random text.

35:28.896 --> 35:31.307
"What if the world actually is ending?"

35:31.331 --> 35:33.743
I know. It's like the
bleakest booty call ever.

35:35.836 --> 35:37.514
Is that what this is?

35:37.538 --> 35:38.681
No.

35:38.705 --> 35:40.817
It's more of, like, a...

35:40.841 --> 35:44.621
an emotional... non-booty call?

35:44.645 --> 35:47.213
Lucky you.

35:49.449 --> 35:51.795
Oh...

35:51.819 --> 35:53.963
I'm just so tired of feeling...

35:53.987 --> 35:55.265
Triggered? Sad?

35:55.289 --> 35:58.268
Me, too.

35:58.292 --> 36:01.093
Don't ever feel bad
about being nice, Blake.

36:05.098 --> 36:06.943
Real friends?

36:06.967 --> 36:08.611
Yeah. Real friends. Come on.

36:08.635 --> 36:10.169
Come on.

36:17.277 --> 36:18.721
So...

36:18.745 --> 36:21.691
what's this about?
Sounded pretty urgent.

36:25.385 --> 36:27.664
Well, you said if I changed my mind,

36:27.688 --> 36:30.567
you'd tear up my letter
of resignation.

36:30.591 --> 36:33.236
You've already announced it.

36:33.260 --> 36:35.538
Things have changed.

36:35.562 --> 36:38.341
Everything we've fought for,

36:38.365 --> 36:40.510
sacrificed for,

36:40.534 --> 36:42.545
is all under attack at the moment.

36:42.569 --> 36:44.414
I just can't see

36:44.438 --> 36:47.817
why way to shaking hands
at county fairs right now.

36:47.841 --> 36:49.485
Please allow me

36:49.509 --> 36:51.788
to rescind my resignation,

36:51.812 --> 36:53.045
sir.

37:03.056 --> 37:04.523
I can't do that.

37:06.193 --> 37:08.504
Wait, I'm sorry. Are you...

37:08.528 --> 37:09.906
We are under attack.

37:09.930 --> 37:13.409
And I do still need your help.

37:13.433 --> 37:15.011
So does your country.

37:15.035 --> 37:18.915
To preserve and build
on what we've done.

37:18.939 --> 37:22.185
My fight's today.

37:22.209 --> 37:24.320
Yours is tomorrow.

37:24.344 --> 37:25.955
So...

37:25.979 --> 37:28.981
I'll be keeping this.

37:40.794 --> 37:43.806
Thank you for your service,
Madam Secretary.

37:43.830 --> 37:45.798
And Godspeed.

37:47.668 --> 37:49.568
Thank you, Mr. President.

37:56.777 --> 37:58.377
You know...

38:00.247 --> 38:03.126
I'd give my right arm
to go to a county fair.

38:27.708 --> 38:31.688
You know, your dad had this
great line about himself...

38:31.712 --> 38:34.023
All his best lines were.

38:34.047 --> 38:38.261
He said, "I tend to
inspire strong reactions,

38:38.285 --> 38:40.897
"usually somewhere between
grudging respect

38:40.921 --> 38:42.532
and outright hostility."

38:42.556 --> 38:45.034
Sounds like Dad.

38:45.058 --> 38:47.036
And he was right.

38:47.060 --> 38:49.138
Because I respected
the hell out of him.

38:49.162 --> 38:51.564
He felt the same way about you.

38:53.800 --> 38:56.168
He'd have wanted you to have this.

39:00.574 --> 39:04.454
Thank you. I will cherish it.

39:04.478 --> 39:06.656
Memorial's ready to start
when you are, ma'am.

39:06.680 --> 39:09.248
We'll see you out there.

39:24.965 --> 39:26.165
Let's go.

39:28.301 --> 39:31.447
On the night Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.
was assassinated,

39:31.471 --> 39:34.684
Robert Kennedy consoled a stunned,

39:34.708 --> 39:37.387
heartbroken crowd in Indianapolis

39:37.411 --> 39:40.256
with the words of a Greek poet.

39:40.280 --> 39:44.761
"Even in our sleep,
pain which cannot forget

39:44.785 --> 39:49.465
"falls drop by drop upon the heart,

39:49.489 --> 39:52.869
"until in our own despair,
against our will,

39:52.893 --> 39:56.695
comes wisdom, through
the awful grace of God."

39:59.399 --> 40:04.547
35 years ago, on a road
not far from here,

40:04.571 --> 40:06.783
a driver lost control of his car,

40:06.807 --> 40:09.819
and crashed into another belonging

40:09.843 --> 40:12.121
to Ben and Suzanne Adams.

40:12.145 --> 40:16.448
My parents were my sun and moon.

40:18.051 --> 40:20.963
I was 15.

40:20.987 --> 40:22.999
My brother Will was 13.

40:23.023 --> 40:27.470
And we were suddenly
all alone in the world

40:27.494 --> 40:29.505
with no one to light our way.

40:29.529 --> 40:31.407
But here's the wisdom

40:31.431 --> 40:35.044
that came to me from that day.

40:35.068 --> 40:36.879
We weren't alone.

40:36.903 --> 40:40.249
We had aunts and uncles,

40:40.273 --> 40:43.653
cousins, friends,
teachers and coaches,

40:43.677 --> 40:46.889
members of our church.

40:46.913 --> 40:48.825
That hard-won wisdom

40:48.849 --> 40:51.694
is what Abraham Lincoln called

40:51.718 --> 40:54.564
"the better angels of our nature."

40:54.588 --> 40:58.534
Empathy, compassion, family,

40:58.558 --> 41:00.336
friends, community.

41:00.360 --> 41:02.805
It's not about me, it's about us.

41:02.829 --> 41:06.909
And it's that idea that brings
me before you today.

41:06.933 --> 41:09.645
In the very first line

41:09.669 --> 41:13.449
of the Constitution,
"We the people..."

41:13.473 --> 41:14.717
When those words were written,

41:14.741 --> 41:17.386
the idea that a country could be

41:17.410 --> 41:19.889
governed by its citizens seemed

41:19.913 --> 41:23.559
revolutionary. Impossible.

41:23.583 --> 41:27.230
But for almost 250 years,
the United States

41:27.254 --> 41:30.266
has done just that, the impossible.

41:31.791 --> 41:34.437
I know we face problems
so big that solving them

41:34.461 --> 41:36.772
seems like a moon shot.

41:36.796 --> 41:39.775
But we're the country
that sent men to the Moon.

41:39.799 --> 41:40.943
We are the envy

41:40.967 --> 41:43.346
of our rivals,

41:43.370 --> 41:45.248
the hope of the oppressed,

41:45.272 --> 41:47.717
the sword and shield

41:47.741 --> 41:50.286
of free people everywhere.

41:50.310 --> 41:52.421
We the people.

41:52.445 --> 41:53.589
It's up to us,

41:53.613 --> 41:57.126
all of us.

41:57.150 --> 41:58.794
So join me, America,

41:58.818 --> 42:00.796
in achieving the impossible together.

42:00.820 --> 42:03.599
That is at the very heart

42:03.623 --> 42:06.302
of this great American experiment.

42:06.326 --> 42:09.272
And that is why, today

42:09.296 --> 42:10.806
I am officially announcing

42:10.830 --> 42:14.143
my candidacy to be president
of the United States.
