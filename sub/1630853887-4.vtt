because that's just
a sorry excuse.

29:34.337 --> 29:38.428
You think I'm callous,
that I don't care about people.

29:38.472 --> 29:40.909
That's not true.

29:40.953 --> 29:43.869
Yeah? Well, all you've done
is shit on us

29:43.912 --> 29:45.522
and say how
we're the worst.

29:45.566 --> 29:48.656
After I lost my team,
I wandered around for two years

29:48.699 --> 29:50.876
until I found
the ranger's station.

29:50.919 --> 29:54.836
I-I climbed up,
knocked on the door, it opened,

29:54.880 --> 29:57.708
and the face that greeted me
stirred up emotions

29:57.752 --> 29:59.928
I never
even know I had.

29:59.972 --> 30:01.451
Who was it?

30:01.495 --> 30:04.498
A former colleague of mine.
Dr. Moseley.

30:04.541 --> 30:06.674
When our research team
fell out,

30:06.717 --> 30:09.503
he was the first one
to go off on his own.

30:09.546 --> 30:12.680
I never thought he'd survive,
and there he was,

30:12.723 --> 30:14.334
continuing his work.

30:14.377 --> 30:15.683
I'd given up hope.

30:15.726 --> 30:17.467
I was ready to die.

30:17.511 --> 30:20.688
Finding him
was like a rebirth.

30:20.731 --> 30:22.516
And then some months in,

30:22.559 --> 30:25.606
I noticed changes
in Dr. Moseley.

30:25.649 --> 30:28.130
He grew weaker.

30:28.174 --> 30:31.133
He tired easily.

30:31.177 --> 30:32.656
He was losing weight.

30:32.700 --> 30:35.050
Then finally, when
I confronted him,

30:35.094 --> 30:37.879
he told me
he was dying of cancer.

30:37.923 --> 30:43.015
He made me promise to not
kill him, but to study him.

30:43.058 --> 30:45.452
Dr. Moseley is Specimen 21.

30:48.411 --> 30:51.284
So, you do know him.
Why did you say you didn't?

30:51.327 --> 30:54.548
It's imperative that
with one study,

30:54.591 --> 30:56.855
you remain as objective
as possible.
