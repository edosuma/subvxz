last year.

00:08.750 --> 00:11.083
Get real, Steve.
Closer to 'finity.

00:11.166 --> 00:12.834
Only one way
to settle it.

00:12.917 --> 00:14.750
Let's go to the gauge!

Hmm, that's odd.

Dad! You're drinking
out of our rain gauge!

00:28.959 --> 00:31.333
Steve, this is
a yard-garita glass.

00:31.417 --> 00:32.792
See? It has
little markers

00:32.875 --> 00:34.667
so I can measure
how jacked up I'm getting.

00:34.750 --> 00:36.417
You ruined
our experiment!

00:36.500 --> 00:38.083
Actually, it seems
like I'm teaching you

00:38.166 --> 00:40.542

leaving your stuff outside.

00:40.625 --> 00:42.458
You should've seen
all the gross water

00:42.542 --> 00:43.709
I had to drink
out of this thing.

00:43.792 --> 00:46.291
Oh, so much sweet rain.

00:46.375 --> 00:47.625

you're more important

00:47.709 --> 00:49.333

00:49.417 --> 00:52.834
Steve, I act like that
because I am more important.

00:52.917 --> 00:54.667
I'm the big dog around here.
Ruff-ruff!

00:54.750 --> 00:55.959
Roger, back me up.

00:56.041 --> 00:57.875
Stan, I'm pissed about
the rain thing, too.

But yes, you are the big dog.
Ruff-ruff.

00:59.792 --> 01:02.417
You see, Steve, I cast
a pretty big shadow.

01:02.500 --> 01:04.834
So either get used to it
or mosey along.

01:04.917 --> 01:07.041
Maybe I will
mosey along.

01:07.125 --> 01:09.917
Maybe you've been holding me
back my whole life!

01:10.000 --> 01:11.667
Maybe I'll run away!

Sounds good.
Send a postcard.

Hey, guys,
I found the answer key

19:16.500 --> 19:19.333
to tomorrow's ethics test
in the garbage.

19:19.417 --> 19:21.041

you to find the answers.

19:38.875 --> 19:41.792
Great news, Steve.
We're shooting in Vancouver.

19:41.875 --> 19:44.166
That means this show
was shot on the cheap.

19:44.250 --> 19:46.500
All we have to do to ruin it
is go over budget.

19:46.583 --> 19:48.250
How the hell do we
do that?!

to sing just two notes
of a Beatles song on air.

is pick one.

19:56.625 --> 19:57.959
Oh, man.

19:58.041 --> 20:00.333
I mean, I'm usually more
of a Monkees guy...
