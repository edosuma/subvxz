00:00.094 --> 00:01.694
Previously on Chasing Life...

00:01.726 --> 00:03.727
This is exciting. I was really 
grabbed by your book

00:03.752 --> 00:04.919
Jaclyn, I can't work for you.

00:04.990 --> 00:06.825
- (Laughs)
- I'm ready to move on

00:06.859 --> 00:08.927
and try succeeding in this
business on my own name.

00:08.961 --> 00:10.494
You make me so happy.

00:10.529 --> 00:12.163
More than anyone I've ever met.

00:12.198 --> 00:13.564
Go at your own pace

00:13.599 --> 00:15.499
and if you get tired, just take a break.

00:15.534 --> 00:18.335
I mean, it's dangerous if the
wrong person breathes on you.

00:18.369 --> 00:21.504
Sorry I got so territorial.

00:22.467 --> 00:24.602
But I'm also not ready
to give up on this place.

00:24.627 --> 00:25.994
It was the future I wanted to build.

00:26.019 --> 00:28.019
But you're totally talking
about April, aren't you?

00:32.766 --> 00:34.567
- (Rock music playing) <i>
- ♪ Hey</i>

00:34.601 --> 00:37.169
<i>♪ into my life</i>

00:38.364 --> 00:39.764
Beth: Yeah, she looks pretty in that one.

00:39.789 --> 00:42.791
She uses so many filters, though.

00:42.816 --> 00:44.656
You can't even tell what
she really looks like.

00:45.206 --> 00:47.274
I mean, she's always
been really pretty though.

00:47.299 --> 00:49.100
Ugh. I want her eyebrows.

00:49.207 --> 00:50.406
Mmm, yours are better.

00:50.431 --> 00:51.563
No.

00:53.992 --> 00:55.126
Girl, hey.

00:55.151 --> 00:56.785
Josh. Josh. Josh.

00:56.810 --> 00:58.144
Josh.

00:58.181 --> 01:00.649
My new roommate's eyebrows are
better than this girls, right?

01:00.674 --> 01:02.375
Um...

01:02.400 --> 01:04.001
Yes.

01:04.025 --> 01:05.193
- Yes.
- (Chuckles)

01:05.218 --> 01:05.953
See?

01:05.978 --> 01:07.712
I'm sorry. You must be so bored.

01:08.017 --> 01:10.719
My old friend from
college is coming into town

01:10.744 --> 01:12.117
and we're getting lunch tomorrow, so...

01:12.142 --> 01:14.043
We have to judge
everything she posts online.

01:14.068 --> 01:15.335
Why? 'Cause you hate her?

01:15.360 --> 01:17.327
No, I don't... I don't hate Ellie.

01:17.578 --> 01:20.680
She just kind of gave me a bit of
a complex when we were at school.

01:20.714 --> 01:23.796
It was between me and her
for editor of the paper.

01:23.821 --> 01:25.230
She got it...

01:25.255 --> 01:27.210
And then she edged me
out for valedictorian.

01:27.235 --> 01:28.235
So you hate her.

01:28.260 --> 01:30.295
Mm-mmm.

01:30.320 --> 01:31.821
We always got along.

01:31.939 --> 01:33.773
We even lived together briefly in New York.

01:34.416 --> 01:37.285
Just thankful that Instagram
wasn't popular back then

01:37.310 --> 01:39.010
or I would have had to watch her take about

01:39.035 --> 01:41.036
a million gym selfies in the mirror.

01:41.061 --> 01:42.761
It's crazy. She has so many followers.

01:42.786 --> 01:44.654
Uh, I'm one of those followers.

01:45.115 --> 01:47.984
I'm sorry. I've been
reading her blog for a while.

01:48.009 --> 01:49.376
You know, she used to
write one for Cosmo.

01:49.401 --> 01:51.770
Oh, no. I know. She got
that job right out of Vassar.

01:51.795 --> 01:53.463
She's just such an oversharer, you know?

01:53.488 --> 01:54.621
It's hard not to look.

01:54.646 --> 01:55.968
Mm.

01:56.016 --> 01:58.117
Well, I'm gonna have to
learn how to overshare myself.

01:58.142 --> 02:00.510
- My agent said that...
- Oh, I'm sorry. I just need to interrupt

02:00.535 --> 02:02.536
to make fun of you for saying "my agent."

02:02.599 --> 02:03.632
Go ahead.

02:03.657 --> 02:06.226
I've waited a very long
time to be able to say that.

02:06.251 --> 02:10.053
Anyway, he said that I have to
pump up my social media presence.

02:10.078 --> 02:11.712
You know, apparently,
authors don't just promote

02:11.737 --> 02:14.507
their books anymore.
They promote themselves.

02:14.532 --> 02:17.568
Well, in your case, it wouldn't
hurt to put a face to a name.

02:17.593 --> 02:19.594
Hmm?

02:19.619 --> 02:20.695
'Cause you're hot.

02:20.720 --> 02:24.055
Oh. Oh! No, I'm, um... I'm...

02:24.080 --> 02:26.247
Oh! My bad.

02:29.378 --> 02:30.543
You okay?

02:32.012 --> 02:34.447
Yeah. I just... I wasn't expecting that.

02:35.436 --> 02:38.037
I've been so in the grieving
part of being a widow

02:38.062 --> 02:41.831
that I hadn't even
considered the moving on part.

02:43.510 --> 02:45.311
I'm definitely not ready for that.

02:45.906 --> 02:48.039
Well, nobody's rushing you.

02:48.064 --> 02:50.966
You can move on when you're
ready, whenever that is.

02:51.334 --> 02:54.269
Right. Well, until then...

02:54.294 --> 02:55.843
May as well just join your relationship.

02:55.868 --> 02:57.179
You wanna be a throuple?

02:57.204 --> 02:58.971
Aren't we already?

02:58.996 --> 03:01.330
Yes. Babe, babe.

03:02.129 --> 03:03.862
My two babes.

Nice to see you so happy.

03:29.007 --> 03:31.475
I much prefer it to violent.

03:31.509 --> 03:33.543
Have you and Finn made it official?

03:34.312 --> 03:37.447
Mom, no one "makes it official" anymore.

03:37.482 --> 03:40.342
We're just together.

03:40.367 --> 03:42.819
Well, he came along at a good time for you.

03:43.226 --> 03:46.188
I know we haven't been
official for very long,

03:46.223 --> 03:49.483
but it feels like we've
known each other forever.

03:49.508 --> 03:50.775
It's weird.

03:50.810 --> 03:53.345
Hey, Junior Ball is this week, right?

03:53.379 --> 03:55.062
Oh, yeah. We're not going.

03:55.087 --> 03:56.387
Aw, because of his leg?

03:56.622 --> 04:00.525
No, because it sounds like torture.

04:00.552 --> 04:02.853
Aw, Brenn, you should go.

04:02.887 --> 04:05.156
I mean, I know it sounds lame,

04:05.181 --> 04:07.898
but sometimes these cliche
milestones can be fun.

04:07.930 --> 04:11.718
Pretty sure it's a better milestone
to never go to a high school dance.

04:11.743 --> 04:13.176
- (Chuckles)
- Later.

04:13.201 --> 04:14.434
- Bye.
- Bye.

04:17.772 --> 04:19.505
So your 10k is coming up. Are you ready?

04:19.820 --> 04:21.641
Uh, yeah. I'm ready for it to be over.

04:21.676 --> 04:23.781
This is much harder than
I thought it would be.

04:25.113 --> 04:26.913
So are you ready to move out again?

04:28.216 --> 04:30.726
Obviously not. I'm coming
over for dinner tonight.

04:31.429 --> 04:34.520
I am ready to have a place again though.

04:34.555 --> 04:36.655
I only lived with Ellie
in New York for two months

04:36.690 --> 04:39.865
before I had to come home and... you know,

04:39.890 --> 04:42.212
I didn't live with Leo for very long, so...

04:46.765 --> 04:48.733
I got hit on last night.

04:48.767 --> 04:50.202
How did that go?

04:50.236 --> 04:51.269
Awkwardly.

04:52.348 --> 04:56.217
The idea of moving on with
someone else just feels so wrong.

04:56.242 --> 04:58.643
Like I'm replacing Leo or something.

04:58.668 --> 05:00.836
I thought I was doing better these days,

05:01.056 --> 05:04.057
but... last night kind of threw me off.

05:04.718 --> 05:07.050
Hey, you know what? Considering
what you've been through,

05:07.085 --> 05:09.375
I can't believe how together you are.

05:10.188 --> 05:13.957
Really! I wasn't writing book
proposals after your dad...

05:16.070 --> 05:18.395
You're smart to keep yourself busy.

05:18.430 --> 05:20.363
It helps you stay positive.

05:20.397 --> 05:21.697
Not go to the dark place.

05:28.239 --> 05:30.106
All right. Sorry, I'm just captioning this.

05:31.908 --> 05:32.942
(Chuckles)

05:33.881 --> 05:35.316
Did you like the filter?

05:37.480 --> 05:38.580
Yep.

05:38.615 --> 05:40.249
I keep trying to post
this, but I'm blowing up.

05:40.283 --> 05:42.251
I have this meet-and-greet
with my Boston followers

05:42.285 --> 05:44.253
in and hour and people keep tagging me.

05:44.287 --> 05:47.256
I don't know how you do it. You must
post things, like, 20 times a day.

05:47.290 --> 05:49.558
I can barely think of one
interesting thing to post a day.

05:49.592 --> 05:51.627
Oh, it doesn't all have to be interesting.

05:51.661 --> 05:53.162
When people follow you,
they just want to feel

05:53.196 --> 05:55.163
like they're going
through your day with you.

05:55.197 --> 05:56.437
Nothing is off limits.

05:56.462 --> 05:59.909
Like this morning, my cat
wouldn't leave the bathroom

05:59.934 --> 06:01.374
when I was trying to do a number two,

06:01.403 --> 06:05.072
so I just took a picture.
Got over 2,000 likes.

06:05.106 --> 06:07.074
I don't even have that many followers.

06:07.108 --> 06:08.742
Oh, whatever.

06:08.777 --> 06:10.742
You're killing it out here,
working for The Post.

06:10.767 --> 06:13.167
I was. I had to quit 'cause my health.

06:13.192 --> 06:14.617
Oh, I'm sorry.

06:14.828 --> 06:16.963
Jeez. Well, if you updated
your social media more,

06:16.997 --> 06:18.031
I would know that.

06:18.065 --> 06:20.667
Well, I'm trying to up my game.

06:20.701 --> 06:22.168
I'm actually writing a memoir,

06:22.202 --> 06:25.101
so I need to get better at
putting myself out there.

06:25.203 --> 06:26.503
Memoir.

06:26.640 --> 06:27.939
Mm-hmm.

06:27.974 --> 06:29.808
You have to lay yourself pretty
bare for one of those things.

06:29.842 --> 06:31.543
You must have changed a lot since college.

06:31.577 --> 06:32.844
What do you mean?

06:32.879 --> 06:34.164
Nothing. I just...

06:34.189 --> 06:35.757
You were always kind of private.

06:35.782 --> 06:37.983
You were really easy to embarrass.

06:38.008 --> 06:40.777
Like when you, me, and Brie
were gonna streak the green

06:40.802 --> 06:42.870
and then at the last minute, you bailed

06:42.895 --> 06:44.429
and you ran back to your dorm room?

06:44.454 --> 06:48.457
And I think that... I think you
blamed feminism or something,

06:48.482 --> 06:50.718
but, uh, we all knew that you were...

06:50.743 --> 06:52.111
- Freaking out. Yes. 
- Mm-hmm.

06:52.136 --> 06:53.836
I remember.

06:53.861 --> 06:58.131
I used to be a lot more concerned with
what people thought of me back then,

06:58.156 --> 07:00.290
but cancer kind of eliminates that for you.

07:00.916 --> 07:02.648
I'm living way more boldly now.

07:02.968 --> 07:04.503
In a way, I never would have

07:04.528 --> 07:06.762
if there weren't a
ticking clock on my life.

07:08.071 --> 07:10.739
That's a really cool way of looking at it.

07:11.500 --> 07:13.934
But I hope that you
haven't changed too much

07:13.968 --> 07:15.903
because I would miss
my little hall monitor.

07:15.937 --> 07:17.398
- (Chuckles)
- (Chuckles)

07:17.423 --> 07:18.929
It is so good to see you.

07:19.008 --> 07:22.110
And I am really proud to
say that I knew you when.

07:22.367 --> 07:24.913
In fact, I'm gonna say it right now.

07:24.947 --> 07:26.080
Let's take a selfie.

07:26.115 --> 07:27.549
Okay.

07:29.344 --> 07:30.578
(Chuckles)

07:30.603 --> 07:31.770
Just look casual.

07:31.795 --> 07:33.196
Oh, sorry. (Clears throat)

07:33.221 --> 07:35.821
You went to college with Ellie Pratt?

07:35.846 --> 07:38.748
She posted a picture from the
gynecologist the other day that went viral.

07:38.773 --> 07:41.585
Yeah, we were kind of
frenemies back in school.

07:41.760 --> 07:43.861
Now that we're older,
I think we can finally...

07:44.098 --> 07:46.299
You know, be happy for
each other's successes.

07:46.702 --> 07:47.968
Can I grab a drink?

07:47.993 --> 07:49.527
Yeah, yeah.

07:51.762 --> 07:53.763
Oh, my God.

07:53.914 --> 07:56.949
You remember when Graham
banned me from drinking these?

07:56.974 --> 07:57.974
Crack 'em open!

07:57.999 --> 07:59.566
Mmm, no.

07:59.591 --> 08:01.024
My cancer's already trying to kill me.

08:01.049 --> 08:02.789
I don't need Graham after me, too.

08:02.880 --> 08:04.448
It's fine. I promise.

08:04.473 --> 08:05.867
He's barely home since he got the new job.

08:05.892 --> 08:08.171
A job. How perfect is that for him?

08:08.203 --> 08:09.771
I mean, he works for Yelp.

08:09.796 --> 08:11.731
He gets to be a professional complainer.

08:11.756 --> 08:14.725
Yeah, but now that he makes more
money, he has less to complain about.

08:14.916 --> 08:16.917
He could actually afford
this place on his own.

08:16.951 --> 08:19.054
He was gonna take it over
when I moved into the house.

08:19.079 --> 08:20.146
What's the plan now?

08:20.939 --> 08:22.573
I'm still deciding.

08:23.022 --> 08:25.623
Since the house is an even
bigger project than it was,

08:25.648 --> 08:27.148
I'm thinking just cut my losses,

08:27.173 --> 08:28.874
sell it, and find something new.

08:29.129 --> 08:30.804
You know, maybe exploring
some other cities, too.

08:30.829 --> 08:33.395
Hmm? Really?

08:33.659 --> 08:35.527
I thought you were
pretty attached to Boston.

08:35.552 --> 08:37.385
Yeah, but that could be my problem.

08:37.410 --> 08:39.881
You know, staying attached to the
idea of something I used to want.

08:39.924 --> 08:42.357
Mmm. As long as you're not...

08:42.500 --> 08:44.914
Giving up on something
that you still do want.

08:44.939 --> 08:46.500
I know you loved that house.

08:46.525 --> 08:47.523
Yeah, I did.

08:47.648 --> 08:49.615
But this could be a good
chance at a fresh start.

08:49.650 --> 08:51.730
You know, sometimes it's
good to know when to move on.

08:55.480 --> 08:57.413
How many place settings do we need?

08:57.438 --> 08:58.838
- Four.
- Five.

08:58.863 --> 08:59.896
I invited William.

08:59.921 --> 09:01.132
I invited Beth and Josh.

09:01.157 --> 09:03.591
Oh, no, no, no. Is this gonna be awkward?

09:03.616 --> 09:05.117
Beth dumped William's son.

09:05.142 --> 09:06.975
She didn't dump him.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.535
She just used him to
make another guy jealous,

09:09.560 --> 09:10.994
and then he dumped her.

09:11.019 --> 09:13.553
Okay, yeah, you should probably
text William and warn him.

09:14.713 --> 09:16.013
(Knocking)

09:16.375 --> 09:17.509
This will be entertaining.

09:22.599 --> 09:25.300
I just got your text.

09:25.469 --> 09:27.570
Hi, April. Didn't get your text.

09:30.302 --> 09:32.703
So, Beth, how long have you and,
uh, John, been seeing each other?

09:32.728 --> 09:35.397
- It's Josh.
- Oh.

09:35.422 --> 09:37.157
Uh, I don't know. About a month or so.

09:39.654 --> 09:41.354
So how's 10k training going, guys?

09:42.179 --> 09:44.480
Um, well, I'm a bundle of nerves

09:44.912 --> 09:47.247
and my body is angry at me, but...

09:47.272 --> 09:48.875
It'll be over soon enough, right?

09:48.900 --> 09:51.801
Sara, remember when you had
me pretend to be your boyfriend

09:51.826 --> 09:54.028
-to make another guy jealous?
-That is not at all what happened.

09:54.053 --> 09:55.093
Remember how ridiculous that was?

09:55.118 --> 09:56.886
But with us it was harmless
because at the end of the day,

09:56.911 --> 09:58.812
we're just a couple of girlfriends.

09:58.837 --> 10:00.838
(Uncomfortable chuckles)

10:02.340 --> 10:03.773
How's the fashion line, Beth?

10:03.918 --> 10:07.250
More importantly, when am I gonna
get to wear one of your designs?

10:07.275 --> 10:10.492
Oh, it's new, you know.
But it's going well so far.

10:10.517 --> 10:12.818
Okay, don't talk about
me like I'm not here.

10:12.843 --> 10:15.878
(Laughter)

10:15.903 --> 10:18.971
You know, it is a little scary
to be out there on my own though.

10:19.781 --> 10:21.714
Well, I think it's brave
of you to take the leap.

10:21.749 --> 10:22.815
It's gonna pay off.

10:22.849 --> 10:25.451
William: I wouldn't have
predicted that, though.

10:25.486 --> 10:27.787
You seem like you'd have
the next thing lined up

10:27.821 --> 10:30.290
before the first thing is over, so...

10:30.324 --> 10:31.557
(Clears throat)

10:31.592 --> 10:32.725
Babe, you've barely eaten anything.

10:32.760 --> 10:33.742
You're not hungry?

10:33.767 --> 10:37.036
No. For some reason, I've
completely lost my appetite.

10:37.250 --> 10:39.451
Oh, no.

10:42.183 --> 10:44.684
So, I think this is good news.

10:45.570 --> 10:48.953
Really? 'Cause it kinda
feels like bad news.

10:48.978 --> 10:50.695
And I have a lot of
experience with that, so...

10:50.727 --> 10:52.061
No, no, no. It's good.

10:52.086 --> 10:53.686
There's just... you know,
there's a complication.

10:53.711 --> 10:55.712
But I think at the end
of the day, it's good.

10:55.737 --> 10:57.704
It's good. It's good.

10:57.729 --> 10:58.562
Good.

10:59.392 --> 11:01.060
Good. Calvin, tell me the news!

11:01.085 --> 11:03.454
There's a Boston-based book
publisher called Book Smart.

11:03.479 --> 11:04.390
I love Book Smart.

11:04.415 --> 11:06.516
Well, they love you, too. They
really responded to your proposal.

11:06.654 --> 11:09.156
What? That's amazing news!

11:09.181 --> 11:10.614
The tricky part is, they're also interested

11:10.639 --> 11:12.940
in this other memoir for
a very similar demographic.

11:12.965 --> 11:15.033
Chances are, they'll only choose one.

11:15.164 --> 11:16.632
Oh.

11:16.657 --> 11:18.007
Okay.

11:18.188 --> 11:19.621
You know, I read this other proposal

11:19.656 --> 11:21.557
and it's not nearly as
well-written as yours,

11:21.591 --> 11:23.359
but what makes me nervous
is that this that girl has

11:23.393 --> 11:25.094
a substantial social media following.

11:25.128 --> 11:26.562
She's actually in Boston right now,

11:26.596 --> 11:27.829
I assume to meet with the publisher.

11:27.864 --> 11:29.223
I've been trying to get
you in there, but...

11:29.248 --> 11:29.797
what's her name?

11:29.832 --> 11:30.899
The author.

11:30.933 --> 11:33.034
- Oh, Ellie. Ellie Pratt.
- (Chuckles)

11:34.752 --> 11:36.052
I guess she has skin cancer?

11:39.789 --> 11:41.789
I hate that Ellie has cancer

11:41.814 --> 11:44.148
But isn't it kinda weird
that she didn't mention it

11:44.183 --> 11:45.834
when we hung out yesterday?

11:45.859 --> 11:47.919
I don't know. It's a pretty
personal thing to talk about.

11:47.954 --> 11:50.068
But nothing is personal with this girl.

11:50.093 --> 11:51.789
I mean, you follow her.

11:51.823 --> 11:53.691
Well, maybe cancer is an exception.

11:53.725 --> 11:54.992
Maybe.

11:55.179 --> 11:56.494
But given our history, it's kind of

11:56.528 --> 11:58.362
a crazy coincidence, you know?

11:58.396 --> 12:00.464
It's like everything I
do, she has to do too.

12:00.499 --> 12:01.665
Yeah. You're right.

12:01.700 --> 12:03.620
She probably got cancer
just to compete with you.

12:04.569 --> 12:06.470
- Okay, that doesn't make any sense.
- No.

12:06.505 --> 12:09.205
Although, it would make a really
good episode of <i>Dr. Phil</i>

12:09.239 --> 12:11.375
just try to give her
the benefit of the doubt.

12:11.400 --> 12:13.033
- Okay?
- Fine.

12:13.065 --> 12:15.534
There's only room for
one of us. That's okay.

12:16.947 --> 12:18.140
I just really hope it's me.

12:18.165 --> 12:18.953
Yeah, me too.

12:18.978 --> 12:21.413
That way you can spoil both of
us once my fashion line tanks.

12:21.732 --> 12:23.300
Hey. Stop with the self hate.

12:23.325 --> 12:26.359
I don't hate myself as a
designer. Just as a businesswoman.

12:26.384 --> 12:27.835
You want to see my business plan so far?

12:27.860 --> 12:29.128
- Mm-hmm.
- All right.

12:30.123 --> 12:32.558
Oh, okay. Wow.

12:32.583 --> 12:34.384
Well, um...

12:34.483 --> 12:36.184
Shouldn't you be using a spreadsheet?

12:36.461 --> 12:38.462
Ugh, I don't even know what that is.

12:38.487 --> 12:39.587
That's okay. That's okay.

12:39.612 --> 12:41.245
It's easy. I will make you a template.

12:41.270 --> 12:42.736
Easy.

12:43.336 --> 12:46.204
Oh, my God. Ellie just
tweeted about her skin cancer.

12:46.229 --> 12:48.331
I'm sure she just hadn't gone public yet.

12:48.414 --> 12:50.115
"Cancer has taught me to live boldly

12:50.149 --> 12:51.717
"in a way I never would have

12:51.751 --> 12:53.986
if there weren't a
ticking clock on my life."

12:54.020 --> 12:55.656
That's a nice way to put it.

12:55.681 --> 12:58.516
That's exactly the way I put
it when I saw her yesterday!

12:58.541 --> 13:00.108
She stole my words!

13:00.258 --> 13:01.993
Okay. All right.

13:02.027 --> 13:03.528
Screw the benefit of
the doubt. She's awful.

13:03.562 --> 13:04.896
(Typing)

13:04.930 --> 13:07.264
I'm gonna unfollow her tonight. Just...

13:08.551 --> 13:10.619
You don't have to work on my
spreadsheet right now. We can...

13:10.644 --> 13:11.777
Oh, I'm not.

13:11.864 --> 13:14.498
I'm trying to figure out a
way to take this bitch down.

13:16.582 --> 13:18.049
Oh. (Laughs)

13:18.074 --> 13:19.975
(School bell ringing)

13:20.153 --> 13:21.960
TJ: We really don't need to ask now.

13:21.985 --> 13:24.851
Trust me. The more prepared you
are, the better the night will be.

13:24.876 --> 13:27.944
No thanks, guys. No threesome
for me, but I'm flattered.

13:27.969 --> 13:29.409
Please, if we were talking threesomes

13:29.434 --> 13:30.868
you know you're not the one we'd be asking.

13:30.893 --> 13:31.703
Babe...

13:31.820 --> 13:33.955
I know you're kidding, but please stop.

13:34.328 --> 13:35.750
You know I have a jealous streak.

13:35.775 --> 13:36.765
Sorry.

13:36.790 --> 13:38.791
I was wondering if you guys
were going to junior ball.

13:38.846 --> 13:40.246
My parents are going to be out of town,

13:40.271 --> 13:42.406
so after-partying at my place.

13:42.519 --> 13:46.376
Junior Ball... I don't think so.

13:46.400 --> 13:48.266
TJ: Oh, you should at least
come to the after-party.

13:48.291 --> 13:51.794
Fifty shades of Grey Goose Martinis.

13:52.574 --> 13:53.807
Think about it.

13:58.020 --> 14:02.289
I am so glad we're on the
same page about this stuff.

14:02.314 --> 14:05.031
Never been to a school
dance in my entire life.

14:05.056 --> 14:07.023
What kind of dancing could I even do?

14:07.048 --> 14:08.815
Eh, I guess there's always the robot.

14:08.840 --> 14:10.275
(Chuckles)

14:11.145 --> 14:13.347
Wait, you don't want to go, do you?

14:13.372 --> 14:15.539
Well, not if you don't.
I don't really care.

14:18.809 --> 14:19.876
Finn?

14:20.487 --> 14:21.519
What?

14:22.953 --> 14:24.888
Will you go to junior ball with me?

14:27.711 --> 14:28.745
(Chuckles)

14:28.779 --> 14:30.212
Was that a yes?

14:30.422 --> 14:31.690
- I didn't hear you.
- Sure.

14:31.724 --> 14:33.191
(Laughs)

14:33.225 --> 14:35.526
There has to be some rule
against what she's doing.

14:35.561 --> 14:38.596
It's like... it's like verbal
plagiarism. Is that a thing?

14:38.630 --> 14:40.931
It's a thing in that this
stuff happens all the time,

14:40.966 --> 14:44.433
but it's not a thing in that you
can't do anything or prove it.

14:44.458 --> 14:46.459
Unless you happened to have a
recoding device at your lunch.

14:46.484 --> 14:47.126
Ha.

14:47.629 --> 14:49.277
The old me probably would have.

14:49.302 --> 14:50.590
I'm glad I'm just meeting you now.

14:50.615 --> 14:52.650
We need to meet these
publishers before Ellie does.

14:52.790 --> 14:54.157
I have an idea.

14:54.182 --> 14:56.048
Do you happen to have any
connections at the U.N.?

14:56.162 --> 14:57.496
Now you're scaring me a little.

14:57.521 --> 14:58.955
No. I found out that <i>The Post</i>

14:58.980 --> 15:00.914
is hosting an event
for Book Smart tomorrow.

15:00.939 --> 15:03.566
It's a book release for
a former U.N. Secretary.

15:03.591 --> 15:05.458
I asked my old coworkers
at the paper if they could

15:05.483 --> 15:06.849
get me in, but they can't.

15:07.217 --> 15:08.351
Maybe you can,

15:08.376 --> 15:10.144
since you know these publishers.

15:11.207 --> 15:12.674
You do know these publishers, right?

15:12.699 --> 15:14.033
You bet. Let me make some calls.

15:16.707 --> 15:19.243
Oh, now. You want me to make the calls now.

15:19.268 --> 15:21.135
I mean, I can... it...

15:23.481 --> 15:24.949
Brenna: Thank you so much for doing this.

15:24.983 --> 15:28.722
I know it's last minute to
ask for a dress in like a day.

15:28.747 --> 15:32.550
I just want you to moderate
your expectations, okay?

15:33.487 --> 15:36.823
Creating my own line has
been a little challenging.

15:36.848 --> 15:38.849
Man, is it hot in here?

15:39.010 --> 15:41.111
- No.
- I feel like I'm sweating.

15:43.014 --> 15:45.448
You know what? I'm gonna grab
some water. I'll be right back.

15:45.473 --> 15:46.746
Okay.

15:48.305 --> 15:51.974
Hey, Brenna. That looks like
it's gonna be a nice dress.

15:51.999 --> 15:54.105
It's cool, right? Beth made it.

15:54.689 --> 15:56.472
You know what? We should go.

15:56.497 --> 15:58.731
Oh, so what's it for?

15:58.756 --> 16:01.623
Like a... Bat Mitzvah? Wha... ?

16:01.648 --> 16:02.681
Bat Mitzvah?

16:02.706 --> 16:04.341
Yeah.

16:04.366 --> 16:07.135
Yeah, maybe Sarah Jessica
Parker's Bat Mitzvah.

16:07.160 --> 16:10.480
Oh, no. I'm just saying, 'cause
it looks so... Buttoned up.

16:10.505 --> 16:12.573
But maybe that's the style these days.

16:12.754 --> 16:14.622
You know, I was gonna
add more yellow Lycra,

16:14.647 --> 16:17.699
but that hasn't been a thing since...

16:17.724 --> 16:19.777
I don't know. Way before I was born.

16:19.802 --> 16:21.803
Ah, well, these are for running.

16:21.828 --> 16:23.529
It's called exercise.

16:23.554 --> 16:24.879
I mean, I don't know
if you maybe haven't...

16:24.904 --> 16:26.605
- Let's go.
- Okay, well Shabbat shalom.

16:30.210 --> 16:31.344
Spin around.

16:33.863 --> 16:35.563
Oh, I hate it now.

16:35.598 --> 16:37.199
Don't hate it. Don't listen to him.

16:37.232 --> 16:39.362
He's right. You look like
you're going to a Bat Mitzvah.

16:39.387 --> 16:40.096
Don't listen.

16:42.000 --> 16:48.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

16:49.878 --> 16:51.378
(Beeping)

16:59.779 --> 17:01.346
We have invites, right?

17:01.380 --> 17:03.215
No, but it shouldn't be a problem.

17:03.249 --> 17:05.150
Stay here. I'm gonna go talk to the guy.

17:05.184 --> 17:06.218
Excuse me.

17:06.252 --> 17:07.318
Hey.

17:07.353 --> 17:08.953
- Dominic.
- You got in!

17:08.987 --> 17:11.320
Uh, not yet. My agent's working on it.

17:11.356 --> 17:12.957
Dominic: I hope he has connections

17:12.991 --> 17:16.460
because they're being way stricter
than usual about the guest list.

17:16.493 --> 17:18.561
It's pretty high security
because of the author.

17:22.607 --> 17:23.773
Hey. Calvin Roth.

17:23.809 --> 17:25.374
I'm here with my literary
client, April Carver...

17:25.409 --> 17:27.209
Oh, no, Calvin. Dominic's a friend.

17:27.243 --> 17:28.377
He can't help us. I already tried.

17:28.412 --> 17:29.579
Oh, sorry, bro.

17:29.613 --> 17:31.781
Dude, I was trying to talk us in there.

17:31.816 --> 17:33.983
Kind of like how I talked you
into being my client, right April?

17:34.017 --> 17:37.019
Um, can I treat you to
dinner to make it up to you?

17:38.165 --> 17:40.099
No? Okay. I'm gonna
call you in the morning.

17:40.124 --> 17:41.224
Let's make magic.

17:41.434 --> 17:42.567
Nice to meet you.

17:42.592 --> 17:44.125
(Frustrated grunt)

17:49.387 --> 17:50.487
April: Ugh.

17:50.513 --> 17:52.214
I thought you guys were friends.

17:52.249 --> 17:55.284
Yeah, so did I, but she's
gonna hijack my book deal

17:55.318 --> 17:56.652
if I don't get in there.

17:56.686 --> 18:00.255
You know what? Time for Plan B.

18:02.558 --> 18:03.598
- April: Hey.
- Guard: Hey.

18:03.623 --> 18:04.575
- Dominic: Hey.
- Hey, hold up there.

18:04.600 --> 18:05.600
Oh.

18:06.611 --> 18:08.746
Yeah, yeah, I got a haircut.

18:09.148 --> 18:10.715
No, this pass is old.

18:10.740 --> 18:12.375
We updated our cards several months ago.

18:12.400 --> 18:13.325
Do you still work here?

18:13.350 --> 18:15.449
Yeah, sorry. Did I give you my old pass?

18:15.474 --> 18:18.476
(Chuckles) My new one
should be in here somewhere.

18:18.501 --> 18:20.870
Just right in...

18:22.848 --> 18:24.281
Ap? Ap! April!

18:26.760 --> 18:28.027
Can we get a medic over here?

18:29.262 --> 18:30.529
Medic!

18:35.849 --> 18:37.349
Medic: Have you ever had a seizure before?

18:37.384 --> 18:39.552
No, um...

18:39.587 --> 18:41.721
No, but my doctor told me it might happen.

18:41.755 --> 18:43.756
I have AML and I'm on a new clinical trial.

18:43.791 --> 18:46.492
We should send you to the hospital.

18:46.526 --> 18:48.227
No. No, no. You don't have to do that.

18:48.261 --> 18:49.795
I'll... I'll tell my doctor what happened.

18:49.829 --> 18:51.622
I see her all the time. Really.

18:51.647 --> 18:53.448
Stay here one second, please.

18:55.508 --> 18:57.576
Are you sure you don't
want to go to the hospital?

18:57.601 --> 18:58.634
Yep.

18:58.914 --> 19:00.414
'Cause I was faking.

19:00.439 --> 19:02.079
Come on. They can't see us from back here.

19:03.646 --> 19:05.411
You can't just do that, April.

19:05.436 --> 19:07.903
I'm sorry! I... I had to think fast.

19:07.928 --> 19:09.568
And when I passes out at that blood drive,

19:09.593 --> 19:11.728
I ended up with an interview
with Richie Miranda, so...

19:11.753 --> 19:13.153
Well, you should have warned me.

19:14.803 --> 19:16.204
I thought it was really happening.

19:18.058 --> 19:20.793
Sorry. I wasn't thinking.

19:24.869 --> 19:26.636
(Party music playing)

19:35.115 --> 19:36.316
April!

19:36.350 --> 19:37.584
Ellie.

19:39.453 --> 19:41.119
Is this your boyfriend?

19:41.154 --> 19:42.154
No.

19:42.188 --> 19:43.856
So where's your girlfriend?

19:43.890 --> 19:45.257
I don't have one.

19:45.291 --> 19:46.725
Good to know.

19:47.687 --> 19:50.155
Doesn't cancer just eliminate
the need for small talk?

19:50.180 --> 19:52.047
You just gotta lay it all
on the table out front.

19:52.072 --> 19:55.074
Yeah, except the whole cancer part, huh?

19:55.099 --> 19:57.767
Cancer's an incredibly personal thing.

19:57.792 --> 20:01.162
It's each person's secret
to tell when they feel ready.

20:01.187 --> 20:03.655
Ellie, you stole my words.

20:03.669 --> 20:05.370
And now you're trying
to steal my book deal?

20:05.404 --> 20:07.639
I mean, what do you even
need a publisher for?

20:07.673 --> 20:09.207
Can't you just release an e-book?

20:09.242 --> 20:12.310
Or like a series of tweets to
your thousands of followers?

20:12.345 --> 20:15.879
Personally, I feel like my
story deserves a hard cover

20:15.913 --> 20:17.638
and a display at Barnes and Noble.

20:17.663 --> 20:19.530
And it's not like you have a monopoly on

20:19.555 --> 20:21.310
on writing a book about cancer putting

20:21.335 --> 20:22.836
your life in perspective.

20:23.100 --> 20:26.069
My skin cancer scare
changed my whole outlook.

20:26.931 --> 20:28.131
Scare?

20:28.156 --> 20:29.290
Yeah.

20:29.315 --> 20:31.115
I had the mole removed, so I'm fine,

20:31.140 --> 20:32.774
but it was cancerous.

20:32.799 --> 20:36.367
And just, you know, thinking about what
might have happened was really hard.

20:36.610 --> 20:40.638
Anyway, I should... I should go
find my contact from Book Smart.

20:40.663 --> 20:43.198
'Cause we've been tweeting
at each other, so...

20:43.223 --> 20:44.390
Check you later?

20:45.659 --> 20:48.826
She clearly wants you.

20:48.851 --> 20:49.951
I need to distract her

20:49.976 --> 20:52.144
so I can meet those
publishers before she does.

20:52.169 --> 20:53.544
So...

20:54.625 --> 20:56.260
You wanna use me as bait.

20:56.285 --> 20:57.885
Please.

21:00.982 --> 21:02.249
Thank you.

21:10.323 --> 21:12.091
(Laughs)

21:12.677 --> 21:13.826
April?

21:13.861 --> 21:15.528
I didn't see your name on the guest list.

21:15.562 --> 21:16.729
Hi, Raquel.

21:16.764 --> 21:18.898
Feel like I have deja vu.

21:18.932 --> 21:21.400
You're in a blazer and
you're here with Dominic?

21:21.600 --> 21:22.833
Raquel: It's happening again?

21:22.858 --> 21:24.659
Uh, no. No, we're just friends.

21:25.938 --> 21:27.472
So then what are you doing here?

21:27.507 --> 21:30.074
I am writing a memoir.

21:30.109 --> 21:31.743
(Chuckles)

21:31.778 --> 21:33.445
Man, I told you you'd get
a book deal out of this.

21:33.479 --> 21:36.980
Well I don't have one yet, but Book
Smart showed interest in my proposal,

21:37.015 --> 21:39.082
so I'm hoping to meet
someone that works there.

21:39.117 --> 21:41.052
Have you met Gwen Johnson?

21:41.077 --> 21:43.846
The president? (Scoffs)
Yeah, right. I wish.

21:43.871 --> 21:45.606
Well, she's here.

21:45.631 --> 21:46.997
She's in my Krav Maga class.

21:47.022 --> 21:49.457
Or, she was before I skipped two levels.

21:49.482 --> 21:52.251
My teacher said that he's
never seen more natural talent

21:52.276 --> 21:55.077
from someone who's never been
in actual military combat.

21:56.020 --> 21:57.553
- Wow.
- You wanna meet her?

21:57.578 --> 21:59.712
I can introduce you.

21:59.737 --> 22:01.371
Are you kidding?

22:02.795 --> 22:04.529
Do I seem like a funny person to you?

22:09.103 --> 22:10.803
You know, I'm no fashion expert,

22:10.828 --> 22:12.561
but that dress looks done to me.

22:12.586 --> 22:13.954
(Sighs)

22:17.827 --> 22:19.094
Cheers.

22:20.244 --> 22:22.712
Thank you, but if I drink that,

22:22.737 --> 22:24.537
I am going to immediately pass out.

22:32.083 --> 22:34.351
And that was not the desired effect.

22:34.376 --> 22:36.731
I'm sorry.

22:36.756 --> 22:38.790
I'm just kind of panicking about my job.

22:38.815 --> 22:40.528
But you did so good with your first order.

22:40.552 --> 22:42.319
That was one dress. And look at me.

22:42.353 --> 22:44.153
I mean, if making one dress is that taxing,

22:44.188 --> 22:46.289
then how in the hell am I going
to make this a full-time business

22:46.323 --> 22:48.057
all by myself?

22:48.100 --> 22:49.967
What was I thinking leaving Jaclyn?

22:49.993 --> 22:51.660
You were being smart.

22:51.695 --> 22:54.130
I just feel like I did
this way before I was ready.

22:54.155 --> 22:55.422
You are ready.

22:55.841 --> 22:58.267
And, look, even if you're not, sometimes...

22:58.302 --> 23:00.935
Sometimes it's a good thing
to jump in without a life vest

23:00.970 --> 23:02.536
and figure it out later.

23:02.667 --> 23:04.402
I don't know about that,

23:04.427 --> 23:07.786
because I am drowning right now.

23:07.811 --> 23:09.578
God, I should never have
let you talk me into this.

23:09.603 --> 23:12.653
I mean, it's not like you just
jumped in without a life vest.

23:12.678 --> 23:14.045
You're a pharmaceutical rep.

23:16.534 --> 23:19.135
Okay, my job might seem safe to you,

23:19.160 --> 23:22.130
but I actually did take
risks to make it happen.

23:22.646 --> 23:24.004
None of my family went to college

23:24.029 --> 23:25.430
and they couldn't pay for it.

23:25.888 --> 23:29.224
I took out a loan myself
and did a two year program

23:29.249 --> 23:30.497
because it's all I could afford.

23:31.474 --> 23:34.275
And now I'm really proud
of the work that I do.

23:34.309 --> 23:36.077
In part because of how I got here.

23:42.315 --> 23:43.882
You're not gonna stay over?

23:43.907 --> 23:45.608
Well, I just...

23:47.032 --> 23:48.532
I feel like I'm not helping you here.

23:48.808 --> 23:51.342
So let's just talk tomorrow, okay?

23:58.670 --> 24:01.404
(Door opens, closes)

24:03.568 --> 24:06.902
Raquel: She was our head reporter
on the Bruce Hendrie campaign,

24:06.927 --> 24:08.827
and April worked with us until last fall

24:08.862 --> 24:10.796
when she had to leave for health reasons.

24:10.830 --> 24:13.966
Now she's writing a memoir that I
hope to play a significant role in.

24:14.000 --> 24:16.735
Oh, you will definitely be in it.

24:16.770 --> 24:19.438
I actually sent my proposal to
Book Smart. Maybe you read it?

24:19.472 --> 24:21.306
Oh, Gwen's too high
ranking to read proposals.

24:21.340 --> 24:23.294
Well, wait a minute. I read some of them.

24:23.319 --> 24:24.341
Um, what's it called?

24:24.366 --> 24:25.399
Chasing Life.

24:25.778 --> 24:27.979
Hmm. Well, titles can be changed.

24:28.013 --> 24:30.138
It's a reference to something my dad wrote,

24:30.163 --> 24:32.474
and it applies to my life,
since I'm living with cancer now.

24:32.499 --> 24:33.614
So I kind of reclaimed it.

24:33.639 --> 24:35.507
Oh, the cancer memoir.

24:35.521 --> 24:38.056
I read your proposal.
That was very entertaining.

24:38.090 --> 24:39.491
Wow, thank you.

24:39.525 --> 24:42.146
Yeah, I wanted to give it some
levity so it wasn't too depressing.

24:42.171 --> 24:44.940
Oh, no, no, no. That was
not depressing at all.

24:44.965 --> 24:46.398
As a matter of fact, the chapter where

24:46.423 --> 24:48.724
you thought your skin
cancer was herpes at first.

24:48.749 --> 24:50.884
Ha! Now that had me laughing out loud.

24:50.909 --> 24:53.692
That's actually not...
That one's not my book.

24:53.717 --> 24:56.185
Oh, but your book is about cancer, too?

24:57.556 --> 24:58.656
Who's your agent?

24:58.681 --> 24:59.714
Calvin Roth.

24:59.930 --> 25:01.097
Mmm.

25:01.638 --> 25:03.773
Uh, April, why don't you
send me what you have.

25:03.807 --> 25:04.840
I'll make sure Gwen gets it.

25:04.875 --> 25:06.008
Thanks, Raquel.

25:06.042 --> 25:08.977
Pleasure to meet you.
Good luck with everything.

25:25.691 --> 25:27.691
Brenna come down. Thank you.

25:31.044 --> 25:32.177
Oh!

25:32.211 --> 25:34.279
Okay, hold on. Stay. Stay.
Wait, wait, wait. Wait.

25:34.313 --> 25:36.753
Stay on the stairs. I want to
get a picture of you coming down.

25:36.782 --> 25:37.749
No, no, no, no, no, no.

25:37.783 --> 25:39.184
That's such a bad angle.

25:39.218 --> 25:41.118
No one looks good from underneath.

25:41.154 --> 25:42.220
Well, Brenna does.

25:43.455 --> 25:45.556
No... no... not that I've seen
her from underneath that much.

25:45.590 --> 25:47.458
I'm just saying she looks
good from all angles. I...

25:47.856 --> 25:49.593
Not that I've seen her from all angles.

25:49.627 --> 25:51.362
I'm just saying, you know, at school, I...

25:51.396 --> 25:54.831
Sara: Finn, it's okay.
I'm not that kind of mom.

25:54.866 --> 25:57.700
But I'm not not that kind of mom. Just...

25:57.734 --> 26:00.552
Yes, thank you. We will behave.

26:00.577 --> 26:03.079
I'm continuing down the stairs now.

26:04.635 --> 26:07.371
Oh, um, uh, here's this...

26:07.587 --> 26:09.788
Flower bracelet thing.

26:09.813 --> 26:10.880
- Corsage.
- Yeah.

26:10.914 --> 26:13.483
April: Oh, look who is
getting into the spirit.

26:13.517 --> 26:15.966
I told you cheesy milestones could be fun.

26:15.991 --> 26:17.981
Embracing the cheese, you know?

26:18.006 --> 26:20.741
If you're gonna go for
it, go big or go home.

26:20.766 --> 26:22.266
That's right.

26:22.291 --> 26:24.627
(Laughter)

26:26.474 --> 26:28.809
- Oh.
- Oh, how sweet.

26:29.108 --> 26:30.408
Boop.

26:33.919 --> 26:36.153
So, did you lock it up with the publisher?

26:36.178 --> 26:38.680
No. Probably not.

26:38.705 --> 26:41.139
I mean, she has a compelling
reason to pick the flashier book

26:41.164 --> 26:43.699
and I just don't know that it'll be mine.

26:44.777 --> 26:46.878
But you know what?

26:46.912 --> 26:48.379
I tried.

26:48.413 --> 26:51.615
- Raquel even helped, weirdly.
- That's not weird.

26:51.650 --> 26:54.151
The Post isn't as
cut-throat as it used to be.

26:54.185 --> 26:55.819
Raquel's way less hostile.

26:55.853 --> 26:57.454
I'm like 20 percent less
attracted to her now.

26:57.489 --> 26:58.192
(Chuckles)

26:58.217 --> 27:00.585
Well, she's probably realizing
that old school journalism

27:00.610 --> 27:02.745
is losing it's power and we
all need to stick together.

27:03.052 --> 27:06.060
Which isn't so easy when there's a
new person getting fired every day.

27:06.130 --> 27:07.664
Or quitting.

27:07.698 --> 27:10.263
Everyone's trying to get out, even me.

27:10.288 --> 27:11.622
Well, you have your book though, right?

27:11.763 --> 27:13.196
It didn't sell.

27:13.221 --> 27:15.523
Even after I added this whole
subplot with sexual roleplay...

27:15.548 --> 27:17.149
I don't know that I need the details.

27:17.174 --> 27:19.342
Now I'm trying to come
up with a backup plan.

27:19.367 --> 27:20.606
Maybe I can invent something.

27:20.631 --> 27:22.398
Ooh, any ideas?

27:22.665 --> 27:24.265
A time machine to take me back to school

27:24.290 --> 27:25.290
so I can pick another major.

27:25.315 --> 27:27.651
- (Chuckles)
- Times are tough.

27:27.687 --> 27:29.454
Even dudes with publishing
deals are getting out.

27:29.479 --> 27:31.333
Dominic's trying to sell
his house so he can bail.

27:31.358 --> 27:35.028
Yeah. He mentioned wanting
to start fresh somewhere else.

27:36.529 --> 27:38.363
I gotta say, I'd be kind
of bummed if he left.

27:38.388 --> 27:40.889
Ugh, God. Don't say that to
him or he'll change his mind.

27:41.033 --> 27:42.568
What do you mean?

27:43.457 --> 27:45.258
Don't tell a secret to
a man with a megaphone.

27:45.283 --> 27:47.050
That's what my parents always used to say.

27:47.075 --> 27:48.910
Is that an old Indian saying?

27:49.284 --> 27:52.085
No. They just said that 'cause
I would tell all their secrets.

27:53.117 --> 27:54.817
(Sighs) Come on, April.

27:55.683 --> 27:57.450
You knew that guy was
still in love with you.

28:04.482 --> 28:05.816
Oh, mom!

28:05.851 --> 28:09.020
Oh, how many shower poufs did you get?

28:09.054 --> 28:11.154
I thought you might like color options.

28:11.188 --> 28:13.823
Right, well now my bathroom
is ready for gay pride.

28:13.858 --> 28:15.659
Yes, but is it ready for...

28:15.693 --> 28:18.227
This fabulous
over-the-door organizer?

28:20.498 --> 28:22.632
How are you my daughter
and not excited about this?

28:22.666 --> 28:24.634
Sorry, I am. Wow.

28:24.823 --> 28:27.558
I'm just... I'm distracted.

28:29.124 --> 28:31.425
I saw Danny today, and...

28:31.623 --> 28:34.792
He basically told me that
Dominic still has feelings for me.

28:34.944 --> 28:37.246
Oh.

28:37.280 --> 28:40.449
Well, that's a lot to process.

28:40.484 --> 28:42.318
Mm-hmm. Yeah.

28:43.338 --> 28:44.637
Well, just because you know

28:44.662 --> 28:47.142
doesn't mean you have to decide
what to do about it right away.

28:51.568 --> 28:53.202
Is Dominic dating Ellie now?

28:53.236 --> 28:54.570
No.

28:54.605 --> 28:56.739
They probably hooked up last night.

28:56.981 --> 29:00.042
So, I could wait to bring it up with him,

29:00.076 --> 29:02.310
but he'll just move on.

29:02.437 --> 29:04.873
You know, you've seen
the guy. He has options.

29:06.935 --> 29:09.528
Consequences aside,
what would you tell him?

29:10.153 --> 29:12.685
I don't know. I...

29:12.710 --> 29:14.678
I would tell him that it's complicated.

29:15.699 --> 29:19.902
You know, when we were together,
for the first time in my life,

29:20.043 --> 29:21.376
I thought, "this is it.

29:21.891 --> 29:23.747
This is the guy."

29:25.632 --> 29:28.434
The timing was just terrible

29:28.538 --> 29:30.606
and things ended so suddenly.

29:30.631 --> 29:33.146
And not because we didn't have
feelings for each other anymore.

29:33.171 --> 29:35.939
But then, you know, I fell for Leo

29:35.964 --> 29:40.734
and... and I threw myself
completely into that.

29:40.759 --> 29:42.426
And now it just...

29:43.724 --> 29:45.892
It feels too soon to start anything again.

29:45.926 --> 29:47.827
I know.

29:51.222 --> 29:54.158
But when I look at that
picture, I don't know. I want...

29:54.183 --> 29:55.841
I want to tell him to just...

29:56.567 --> 29:59.068
I don't know, wait for me.

29:59.461 --> 30:01.495
That's so selfish, though.

30:02.276 --> 30:03.710
(Grunts)

30:03.735 --> 30:07.871
Okay, but don't let guilt
make the decision for you.

30:09.396 --> 30:11.230
Sometimes you just have
to listen to your heart,

30:11.265 --> 30:13.599
no matter how selfish it sounds.

30:22.341 --> 30:25.152
Then we do a mile along the waterfront.

30:25.177 --> 30:26.977
And end up in the leather district.

30:27.012 --> 30:29.247
- Oh, maybe I can find a daddy.
- I'm nervous.

30:29.290 --> 30:32.091
I mean, I've never even made
it through a full practice run.

30:32.116 --> 30:34.650
-You know what? Maybe I shouldn't do this.
-No, the a... no, the adrenaline

30:34.675 --> 30:36.208
- will help.
- No, no, no, no, no. I... I... I...

30:36.233 --> 30:38.969
It's been great running for fun with you,

30:38.994 --> 30:40.828
but the pressure of a race

30:40.853 --> 30:43.521
is just making me feel discouraged.

30:44.013 --> 30:46.963
With all the family drama I've had lately,

30:46.997 --> 30:49.075
negative feelings are
the last thing I need.

30:49.100 --> 30:51.204
Use it to motivate you.

30:51.229 --> 30:53.796
Think about someone who's wronged you.

30:53.821 --> 30:55.888
Or... or one of your children.

30:55.913 --> 30:58.180
Hell hath no fury like a parent scorned.

30:58.205 --> 30:59.646
Yeah, so I've noticed.

30:59.857 --> 31:02.792
You should lighten up
on Beth. She's only 24.

31:02.826 --> 31:06.662
Well, I just hate to see my son blindsided,

31:06.697 --> 31:09.498
and it's not like Beth
upgraded. Have you seen my son?

31:09.532 --> 31:11.766
He's taller. He's better
looking than Tristan.

31:13.440 --> 31:15.508
Uh, Josh? Ugh.

31:15.533 --> 31:17.167
Mmm.

31:18.205 --> 31:21.674
I'm sure my therapist
friend is not going to let

31:21.699 --> 31:24.234
that Freudian slip pass, is she?

31:24.433 --> 31:26.232
No, she is not.

31:26.257 --> 31:28.758
Just found out that my ex is engaged

31:28.783 --> 31:31.685
to that pocket gay.

31:31.710 --> 31:34.079
Aw, I'm sorry. Why didn't you tell me?

31:34.104 --> 31:35.438
I was still in shock.

31:35.468 --> 31:38.444
It's stupid, but in my mind,
I was hoping that they'd...

31:38.469 --> 31:39.903
Just be a fling.

31:39.928 --> 31:42.229
You would have taken him back?

31:42.475 --> 31:44.708
I agreed to be with that
man for the rest of my life.

31:44.743 --> 31:47.178
He's the one that broke the contract.

31:47.212 --> 31:48.712
Yeah, I didn't have that option,

31:48.747 --> 31:49.975
working things out with my husband,

31:50.000 --> 31:53.702
but I suppose if I had, I
probably would have tried.

31:53.840 --> 31:55.573
Which would have been a mistake,

31:55.598 --> 31:59.067
because I'm better off being
single than living a lie.

32:00.484 --> 32:03.719
You... you can't really be that
zen about it. Weren't you angry?

32:03.753 --> 32:06.188
Well, if I let myself dwell on the details,

32:06.222 --> 32:08.423
I will get angry. That's
why I don't go there.

32:08.458 --> 32:13.462
I'm telling you, Sara, sometimes
it's good to go there. Get angry.

32:13.823 --> 32:17.064
It'll put a fire in
your belly in a good way.

32:17.099 --> 32:20.018
Like when you need to run a 10k.

32:20.122 --> 32:22.123
Hmm? Yes?

32:24.276 --> 32:25.476
- Okay.
- All right.

32:25.501 --> 32:28.103
- There you go.
- Actually, yes. Go.

32:28.128 --> 32:29.695
- Okay.
- (Laughs) Yeah.

32:33.960 --> 32:36.595
Well, here's to making it
through that train wreck.

32:37.049 --> 32:38.482
Teej, we're waiting.

32:38.932 --> 32:43.535
Sorry, my strawberry jalapeño
shooter needs a jalapeño.

32:43.560 --> 32:44.760
Cheers.

32:44.785 --> 32:46.086
Cheers.

32:50.580 --> 32:51.947
TJ: What? You don't like it?

32:51.982 --> 32:54.750
I made yours with cilantro and
lime 'cause you can't drink.

32:54.784 --> 32:56.352
That's what it is, cilantro.

32:56.386 --> 32:59.251
I used to love the stuff, but after my
transplant it tastes like soap to me.

32:59.307 --> 33:01.575
Cilantro always tastes like soap to me.

33:01.610 --> 33:03.277
(Both chuckle)

33:03.311 --> 33:05.546
By the way, it's your lucky night.

33:05.580 --> 33:07.414
Mariah and her new girlfriend

33:07.448 --> 33:09.549
went to an anti-rape
rally at Harvard tonight,

33:09.583 --> 33:13.019
so we have an extra room.

33:14.109 --> 33:15.809
What do you mean you have an extra room?

33:15.834 --> 33:17.535
Oh my God, you're so cute.

33:17.560 --> 33:19.461
Babe, what did we talk about?

33:21.817 --> 33:23.683
There's a bedroom at the end of the hall

33:23.708 --> 33:26.509
waiting for you and your lady
whenever you're ready to get...

33:26.819 --> 33:28.953
You know, more intimate.

33:30.028 --> 33:32.429
Oh, don't worry. I got your back.

33:32.893 --> 33:34.694
And your front.

33:42.932 --> 33:45.233
TV: <i>Okay, ladies,</i>
<i>time is running out... </i>

33:45.268 --> 33:48.003
You learn something new about
your best friend every day.

33:48.038 --> 33:50.939
April: Never would have pegged you
for a home shopping network fan.

33:50.974 --> 33:52.507
Something about how the models spin around

33:52.542 --> 33:55.277
in those stretchy pants just calms me down.

33:56.067 --> 33:57.467
(Knocking)

33:57.493 --> 33:59.427
You get it.

33:59.452 --> 34:01.419
Nope. I'm not wearing a bra.

34:02.167 --> 34:03.400
Sorry.

34:06.136 --> 34:07.269
April: Coming.

34:09.830 --> 34:11.830
- Hey...
- (April sighs)

34:12.666 --> 34:13.864
Ellie got published, didn't she?

34:13.899 --> 34:16.435
No, but, uh, you sort of did.

34:16.469 --> 34:17.601
What?

34:17.637 --> 34:19.036
What are you talking about?

34:19.071 --> 34:21.672
A chapter from your proposal
leaked to The Post's website.

34:21.708 --> 34:23.208
I don't even know how it happened.

34:23.242 --> 34:27.001
My old boss, Raquel, said she was
gonna slip it to Gwen at Book Smart.

34:27.025 --> 34:28.560
Well, she slipped it to all of Boston.

34:28.585 --> 34:30.318
April: Of course she wasn't
trying to do me a favor.

34:30.342 --> 34:31.969
She was trying to screw me over!

34:31.995 --> 34:34.429
Oh, my God! Is this...
Is this bad? Is this bad?

34:34.494 --> 34:35.927
I mean, it's not the best thing

34:35.962 --> 34:37.161
when you're looking to get published,

34:37.197 --> 34:38.297
since it's no longer exclusive.

34:38.331 --> 34:39.465
No, no. Calvin, Calvin.

34:39.498 --> 34:41.139
You're supposed to tell me that it's okay.

34:41.167 --> 34:42.900
I don't know if it is.
I'm new to this, too.

34:42.935 --> 34:44.255
Just say it's okay. Say it's okay.

34:55.666 --> 34:57.767
That wall is so pink.

34:58.642 --> 35:00.410
Finn: Yeah, it is.

35:03.609 --> 35:05.277
I used to want a bed like this.

35:07.120 --> 35:08.955
I always wanted a waterbed.

35:08.980 --> 35:10.213
(Both chuckle)

35:14.596 --> 35:16.731
Well, this is awkward. (Chuckles)

35:17.172 --> 35:19.306
It doesn't have to be.

35:21.093 --> 35:23.895
You're in a unique situation

35:24.040 --> 35:28.308
and you have to prioritize
your health above anything.

35:29.333 --> 35:30.876
And I get that.

35:38.119 --> 35:40.120
Living on the edge, huh?

35:45.451 --> 35:46.652
What's wrong?

35:48.322 --> 35:50.257
You know we can't do that,

35:50.831 --> 35:53.199
as much as I want to.

35:54.395 --> 35:56.429
I... I just hate that I've only

35:56.454 --> 35:58.855
kissed my girlfriend with a stupid mask on.

36:03.635 --> 36:05.103
Well...

36:07.080 --> 36:10.149
How risky would it be
if we just kissed once?

36:13.774 --> 36:15.641
I'm willing to find out if you are.

36:30.609 --> 36:32.610
I don't want to make you sicker.

36:33.717 --> 36:35.599
Can we just pretend that I'm not?

36:35.696 --> 36:37.197
Please?

36:38.496 --> 36:40.564
<i>♪ I do</i>

36:43.939 --> 36:46.508
<i>♪ I want you</i>

36:48.120 --> 36:50.520
<i>♪ I want you</i>

36:52.644 --> 36:55.012
<i>♪ I want you</i>

36:56.478 --> 36:58.346
<i>♪ I do</i>

36:59.672 --> 37:02.808
Thank you for stopping by. I needed this.

37:03.108 --> 37:04.609
Of course. It was on the way

37:04.634 --> 37:06.468
to the finish line at my mom's 10k.

37:08.890 --> 37:12.447
So, I realized I never talked to you

37:12.481 --> 37:14.248
after throwing you to the
wolves at the book launch.

37:14.531 --> 37:15.671
You mean Ellie.

37:15.696 --> 37:18.062
Yeah, she was interesting.

37:18.087 --> 37:19.454
Pretty aggressive.

37:20.274 --> 37:22.341
So how long did you guys hang out for?

37:22.366 --> 37:23.733
I saw the pictures you posted.

37:23.758 --> 37:25.057
(Chuckles) You did?

37:25.104 --> 37:26.570
Yeah.

37:26.595 --> 37:28.963
Well, right after that,
she ditched me and started

37:28.988 --> 37:31.522
chasing after the arts and
entertainment guy at <i>The Sentinel.</i>

37:32.051 --> 37:34.853
Wasn't about me. She just
wanted press for her book.

37:34.878 --> 37:37.647
Hmm. Well, she can take mine.

37:37.693 --> 37:39.026
Now that my excerpt leaked,

37:39.051 --> 37:40.367
there's no way it's getting published.

37:40.609 --> 37:42.976
Hey, did you make a
decision about the house?

37:43.265 --> 37:44.932
Yeah.

37:44.957 --> 37:47.158
My mom thinks I'll be
able to sell it again as is

37:47.183 --> 37:50.018
and financially, it makes the
most sense for me to do that.

37:50.043 --> 37:52.110
So I'm in the market for a new place.

37:52.687 --> 37:54.320
Here or... ?

37:54.355 --> 37:55.421
Anywhere.

37:55.446 --> 37:59.114
You know, there's nothing tying me
down to any particular city, so...

38:00.749 --> 38:03.585
It's kind of exciting. There are so
many cities I can see myself living in.

38:03.767 --> 38:05.635
Nashville, Seattle...

38:10.368 --> 38:11.501
Keep me posted.

38:12.880 --> 38:14.080
I should head to the race.

38:14.105 --> 38:16.540
Thanks for this.

38:27.287 --> 38:31.231
April: <i>After I was diagnosed,</i>
<i>my anger felt insurmountable.</i>

38:31.278 --> 38:33.859
<i>I couldn't accept the fact
that my life could be ending</i>

38:33.893 --> 38:36.428
when I was only supposed to be
a quarter of the way through it.

38:36.462 --> 38:37.730
(Cheering and applause)

38:37.764 --> 38:41.100
<i>I feared the start
of my next chapter.</i>

38:41.134 --> 38:43.401
<i>Is happiness even worth experiencing</i>

38:43.436 --> 38:46.404
<i>if it's followed by
such enormous pain?</i>

38:47.440 --> 38:49.073
There she is! Go, mom!

38:49.108 --> 38:51.542
<i>It's the beauty and
tragedy of being alive.</i>

38:53.011 --> 38:54.511
<i>And I didn't know if
I was strong enough</i>

38:54.546 --> 38:57.548
<i>to go through another round
of hope and then despair,</i>

38:57.582 --> 39:00.218
<i>especially as my body
conspired against me.</i>

39:06.394 --> 39:09.630
<i>So, I press on, like we all do.</i>

39:11.142 --> 39:13.309
<i>Whether we're sick or not,</i>

39:13.334 --> 39:17.504
we're all withstanding the lows
to get a taste of the highs.

39:17.529 --> 39:19.262
<i>They're that good.</i>

39:21.372 --> 39:22.772
(Cheers)

39:26.131 --> 39:27.432
Beth?

39:29.453 --> 39:30.953
I'm in the bathroom.

39:30.978 --> 39:33.514
Can you come here a second?

39:42.507 --> 39:43.873
Oh, my God.

39:44.564 --> 39:46.098
Yeah.

39:46.697 --> 39:49.633
I missed my period last month, but...

39:49.658 --> 39:52.126
I mean, that happens to me sometimes.

39:52.151 --> 39:55.186
So, the reason why I've been so sick

39:55.527 --> 39:57.434
and emotional is, uh...

39:58.025 --> 40:00.494
Josh Junior?

40:00.880 --> 40:03.314
Or, sorry, I guess it could be Beth Junior.

40:03.544 --> 40:05.244
Or Graham Junior.

40:07.098 --> 40:09.267
Okay. Okay, we can figure that out.

40:09.903 --> 40:12.471
I really don't know what to do.

40:13.966 --> 40:15.267
(Phone ringing)

40:15.292 --> 40:17.026
Don't. Don't.

40:17.051 --> 40:18.285
No, just take it.

40:18.806 --> 40:21.273
I'll still be frozen here when you're done.

40:37.576 --> 40:38.977
Calvin: <i>(Chuckles)</i>

40:39.011 --> 40:40.145
Um...

40:40.179 --> 40:41.179
April: <i>Hello?</i>

40:41.213 --> 40:42.576
You really got me, April.

40:43.273 --> 40:44.282
Sorry?

40:44.316 --> 40:45.449
<i>Some good news first.</i>

40:45.484 --> 40:48.518
Book Smart picked you over Ellie. Boom!

40:48.552 --> 40:50.754
But, I thought because
the chapter leaked, that...

40:50.789 --> 40:52.389
The chapter leak is
what made them pick you.

40:52.423 --> 40:55.425
The comment section on 
The Post website blew up.

40:55.459 --> 40:56.927
People love your story.

40:57.962 --> 40:59.696
Oh, my God! That's amazing!

40:59.730 --> 41:01.064
The most amazing news is that when we

41:01.099 --> 41:03.166
sell this, I'll probably get my own office.

41:03.200 --> 41:04.767
By the way, very funny using

41:04.802 --> 41:06.202
the name Chasing Life,

41:06.236 --> 41:08.437
when you know there's a book already
being shopped around with that title.

41:08.471 --> 41:09.505
Oh, there is?

41:09.539 --> 41:12.574
"Oh, there is?" Yes, it
was written by your dad.

41:14.211 --> 41:16.091
Wait, do you know who's
trying to sell the book?

41:17.047 --> 41:18.514
Is it Natalie Ortiz?

41:18.548 --> 41:21.817
Something like that. It's, uh, hang on.

41:22.774 --> 41:24.041
Olivia Ortiz.
