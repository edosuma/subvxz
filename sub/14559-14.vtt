WEBVTT

00:14.582 --> 00:16.317
WOMAN:
Mr. Bell!

00:16.350 --> 00:18.086
I'm from
the U.S. Attorney's Office.

00:18.119 --> 00:20.388
They sent me over to make
sure you didn't get lost.

00:20.421 --> 00:22.690
After seeing you, getting lost
may not be such a bad idea,

00:22.723 --> 00:23.724
(chuckles) I have a car waiting.

00:23.757 --> 00:24.392
Fine.

00:26.594 --> 00:28.028
(security door buzzing)

00:42.510 --> 00:44.345
(grunting, yelling)

00:47.248 --> 00:49.450
PRISONER:
Get him off me, man!

00:49.483 --> 00:50.384
(prisoner crying)

00:51.819 --> 00:56.524
I'm not supposed to give
my deposition for another hour.

00:56.557 --> 00:58.126
So, if you're hungry,
we could...

00:59.727 --> 01:01.695
What... What are you doing?

01:01.729 --> 01:04.198
I don't want to leave
any fingerprints.

01:05.266 --> 01:06.567
(silenced gunshot)

01:10.471 --> 01:12.406
FBI! Drop the gun!

01:12.440 --> 01:14.475
(gunfire)

01:21.249 --> 01:24.218
AMITA:
Ugh! You're making such a mess.

01:24.252 --> 01:25.453
- Let me do it.
- Gee...

01:25.486 --> 01:27.255
An exact
180-degree fold.

01:27.288 --> 01:28.656
I guess that's
what I should expect

01:28.689 --> 01:30.558
from a master
of combinatorics.

01:30.591 --> 01:33.494
Actually, I used to work
at the Gap in high school.

01:33.527 --> 01:35.729
Are you sure this is
such a good idea?

01:35.763 --> 01:38.266
Uh, yeah. Doing FBI work
for years without any training

01:38.299 --> 01:40.801
being stalked,
getting shot at--

01:40.834 --> 01:42.403
more than once--

01:42.436 --> 01:45.239
uh, I think it's a pretty
excellent idea, actually.

01:45.273 --> 01:46.640
What are they going
to have you doing?

01:46.674 --> 01:47.908
It's a little self-defense,
some firearms training.

01:47.941 --> 01:50.178
It's no big deal.
It'll be good for him.

01:50.211 --> 01:51.044
All right?

01:51.078 --> 01:52.613
Did I hear something about
firearms?

01:52.646 --> 01:54.648
Uh, yes, Charlie is going
through two days

01:54.682 --> 01:55.616
of FBI training.

01:55.649 --> 01:57.285
- His idea.
- What do you mean, my idea?!

01:57.318 --> 01:59.320
It was because you've been
asking me forever.

01:59.353 --> 02:00.354
Wait a minute...

02:00.388 --> 02:02.323
This does not mean
that he gets to carry a gun

02:02.356 --> 02:03.257
after this, right?

02:03.291 --> 02:03.657
Uh, I don't know--
maybe some handcuffs.

02:03.691 --> 02:05.659
Hmm, really?

02:05.693 --> 02:07.728
(phone rings)

02:07.761 --> 02:09.797
Eppes.

02:09.830 --> 02:11.465
Don, U.S. Attorney's office
just called.

02:11.499 --> 02:13.501
Two RICO witnesses scheduled
to testify

02:13.534 --> 02:15.703
in the same trial next week
were just hit.

02:15.736 --> 02:17.638
David and Colby went to pick up
a third,

02:17.671 --> 02:18.672
ended up in a gunfight.

02:18.706 --> 02:19.940
Okay, I'm on my way.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.942
Hey, I got to go.
So, uh, kick ass, all right?

02:21.975 --> 02:23.544
CHARLIE & AMITA:
Thanks.

02:23.577 --> 02:27.248
COLBY: Nice. This guy dressed as
a delivery man.

02:27.281 --> 02:28.882
Obviously put a
little thought into it.

02:28.916 --> 02:30.518
An agent from OC
I.D.'d him

02:30.551 --> 02:32.653
as a low-level gunman
in the Albanian mafia.

02:32.686 --> 02:34.522
What's up?

02:34.555 --> 02:36.790
So we know they were looking
for a guy named Reggie Smith,

02:36.824 --> 02:38.659
who used to run with
the Bixel Street Boyz.

02:38.692 --> 02:40.528
Made a deal with the
U.S. Attorney's Office

02:40.561 --> 02:42.596
to turn against the
leader of his own crew.

02:42.630 --> 02:46.267
And the DOJ has been putting him
up here for about a month.

02:46.300 --> 02:48.569
He was supposed to testify
along with the two victims.

02:48.602 --> 02:50.638
Any idea where
he is now?

02:50.671 --> 02:52.240
Building manager said

02:52.273 --> 02:53.774
he took off this afternoon
in a real hurry.

02:53.807 --> 02:55.843
Right, well, if he thought
he was next to get hit...

02:55.876 --> 02:57.378
He's making tracks
to get out of town

02:57.411 --> 02:59.480
while he still can.

02:59.513 --> 03:01.615
All right, so we'd better get
this guy's Smith's photo out

03:01.649 --> 03:02.850
to all the roll calls--
I mean, L.A. to Fresno.

03:02.883 --> 03:04.818
If we don't find him,
they will.

03:14.962 --> 03:18.799
I got this off a traffic camera
at 8th and Alameda.

03:18.832 --> 03:20.901
Well, yeah, leather gloves-- I
mean, it's like what,

03:20.934 --> 03:22.536
70 degrees.

03:22.570 --> 03:23.837
Kind of telling, huh?

03:23.871 --> 03:26.374
Quantico has
no facial matches.

03:26.407 --> 03:29.643
Robin Brooks is in here,
taking a dying declaration

03:29.677 --> 03:31.779
from the prisoner who was
stabbed outside the courthouse.

03:31.812 --> 03:34.848
I know things ended kind
of weird for you, so,

03:34.882 --> 03:36.717
if it's too uncomfortable,
I can take the lead.

03:36.750 --> 03:37.951
I don't care. Uh...

03:37.985 --> 03:39.820
Just check with Langley
on this, though.

03:39.853 --> 03:42.290
I think the Albanian assassin
sounds more like their turf.

03:43.857 --> 03:44.892
(clears throat)

03:46.660 --> 03:47.795
- Hey.
- Hey.

03:47.828 --> 03:49.363
No idea you were back.

03:51.999 --> 03:56.003
Well, I'm just, um,
I'm going to try Langley again.

03:56.036 --> 03:58.005
- Nice to see you, Robin.
- You too.

03:59.407 --> 04:01.642
We're building
a major RICO case

04:01.675 --> 04:03.611
against Jarobi
"J-Light" Taylor.

04:03.644 --> 04:05.646
Murder, robbery, extortion,
kidnapping--

04:05.679 --> 04:07.781
he's hit every offense
on the list.

04:07.815 --> 04:10.318
- He runs the Bixel Street Boyz.
- I know who he is.

04:10.351 --> 04:11.752
He's like the Don Corleone
of the LA gang world.

04:11.785 --> 04:12.886
The guy's so powerful,

04:12.920 --> 04:14.788
he can continue running
his empire, even from prison.

04:14.822 --> 04:16.324
We can't figure out
how he's sending out orders.

04:16.357 --> 04:17.725
And this guy's
in Bixel too?

04:17.758 --> 04:19.493
ROBIN: He committed two murders

04:19.527 --> 04:20.761
on J-Light's orders last year.

04:20.794 --> 04:22.530
There's no guarantee
the judge

04:22.563 --> 04:24.565
is going to allow
his dying declaration.

04:24.598 --> 04:26.734
Yeah, or if a jury's
gonna even buy it.

04:26.767 --> 04:28.802
Reggie Smith also worked as
a triggerman for Bixel Street.

04:28.836 --> 04:30.871
You find him, my chances
of winning this case

04:30.904 --> 04:32.072
increase a hundred percent.

04:32.105 --> 04:35.309
Well, I mean, the hits had to be
pretty well orchestrated,

04:35.343 --> 04:36.444
so I wouldn't be surprised
if there were a leak,

04:36.477 --> 04:37.845
you know, I mean,
even in the DOJ.

04:37.878 --> 04:40.080
Any information would've gone
to J-Light's number two,

04:40.113 --> 04:41.349
Dwight "Heavy" Reddick,

04:41.382 --> 04:43.951
worked his way up through Bixel
Street, one murder at a time.

04:43.984 --> 04:45.819
He was paroled last year.

04:45.853 --> 04:47.388
I need a list of
computers and anyone

04:47.421 --> 04:48.622
who had access to
J-Light's info, then.

04:48.656 --> 04:50.624
You're talking about
hundreds of people,

04:50.658 --> 04:51.625
thousands of e-mails.

04:51.659 --> 04:53.961
It could take months to
narrow that stuff down.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.963
When did you get back?

04:55.996 --> 04:57.765
A couple months ago,

04:57.798 --> 05:00.000
right after I wrapped that case
in Miami.

05:00.033 --> 05:01.802
Look, I don't want
there to be

05:01.835 --> 05:03.604
any friction between us.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.839
Don't worry about it.

05:17.117 --> 05:18.919
Okay, here's the scenario:

05:18.952 --> 05:21.021
You've just witnessed
an armed robbery,

05:21.054 --> 05:22.390
multiple shots fired.

05:22.423 --> 05:23.957
Ready? Go.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.092
Let me just...

05:25.125 --> 05:27.461
make sure I'm...
Okay, I'm good there.

05:27.495 --> 05:29.797
What are you doing, Eppes?
This isn't driver's ed.

05:29.830 --> 05:30.864
You're in pursuit!

05:34.535 --> 05:35.503
Okay.

05:35.536 --> 05:37.771
The siren, Agent Eppes.

05:37.805 --> 05:38.739
You forgot your siren.

05:38.772 --> 05:41.509
Yeah, so that's right, uh...
where is that?

05:41.542 --> 05:42.976
(short siren blast)

05:43.010 --> 05:43.777
What...?

05:45.012 --> 05:46.914
(thudding)

05:46.947 --> 05:49.817
You just killed a mailbox.
Keep your eyes on the road.

05:53.554 --> 05:55.756
Radio-- you need to call in
your pursuit.

05:55.789 --> 05:57.625
Uh-huh. (clears throat)

05:57.658 --> 05:59.126
Good morning.

05:59.159 --> 06:00.794
This is Charles Eppes.

06:00.828 --> 06:02.396
(sighs)
I'm in pursuit of a...

06:02.430 --> 06:05.999
burgundy-ish, sort of...

06:06.033 --> 06:07.601
merlot-colored, um...

06:07.635 --> 06:09.903
Well, what model of car
would you say that is?

06:09.937 --> 06:11.572
It's a Ford.

06:11.605 --> 06:13.941
It really doesn't look
like a Ford. Anyway, a Ford!

06:13.974 --> 06:15.909
(tires squealing)

06:15.943 --> 06:17.010
Look out!

06:17.044 --> 06:20.113
(brakes screeching)

06:23.016 --> 06:25.986
Hey... Speed Racer.

06:26.019 --> 06:27.788
Can I borrow him for a minute?

06:27.821 --> 06:30.090
Take the afternoon.

06:30.123 --> 06:32.159
CHARLIE:
So, how many people

06:32.192 --> 06:33.994
had access to the
witnesses' information?

06:34.027 --> 06:35.596
Um, about 50,

06:35.629 --> 06:37.665
but with all the e-mails
and the correspondence,

06:37.698 --> 06:38.866
it's like thousands.

06:38.899 --> 06:40.801
It's quality not quantity.

06:40.834 --> 06:43.036
In this case, temporal link
analysis will prove that.

06:43.070 --> 06:44.572
How so?

06:44.605 --> 06:46.874
Imagine an uncut diamond...

06:46.907 --> 06:48.075
Ooh, that's not a problem.

06:48.108 --> 06:50.944
When the diamond's discovered,
it's a large uncut stone,

06:50.978 --> 06:54.615
under a microscope, the flaws
and inclusions become visible.

06:54.648 --> 06:56.817
To maximize profit,
they have to cut the stone

06:56.850 --> 06:59.052
to remove the imperfections,
so that the valuable

06:59.086 --> 07:00.988
and brilliant facets
are revealed.

07:01.021 --> 07:04.625
Similarly, temporal link
analysis searches e-mail sent

07:04.658 --> 07:06.827
by users who have access
to sensitive information.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.529
It removes the bad ones,
or the flaws,

07:08.562 --> 07:11.632
and reveals the ones that are
of true value.

07:11.665 --> 07:13.967
We're looking for an e-mail
outside their job parameter?

07:14.001 --> 07:15.202
Yeah, that's exactly it.

07:15.235 --> 07:17.638
Eppes! You're up.

07:17.671 --> 07:19.773
All right, I will call
Larry and Amita,

07:19.807 --> 07:21.108
and they should be able
to help you.

07:21.141 --> 07:21.942
All right. Thanks, Charlie.

07:21.975 --> 07:23.677
And, hey, um...

07:23.711 --> 07:25.713
you want to break into the turn,
accelerate on the way out.

07:25.746 --> 07:26.680
Okay, thanks.

07:26.714 --> 07:28.115
(chuckles)

07:32.119 --> 07:34.922
A watch like that must make
you the man in charge, huh?

07:34.955 --> 07:37.925
Two dead witnesses were supposed
to testify against your boss.

07:37.958 --> 07:39.993
Bitch and snitch,
wind up in a ditch.

07:40.027 --> 07:42.129
That's what happened to your
delivery boy, Reggie Smith?

07:42.162 --> 07:44.698
I wouldn't know
anything about that.

07:44.732 --> 07:47.601
But if a accident happens
to befall on Reggie,

07:47.635 --> 07:49.703
it would be a damn shame.

07:49.737 --> 07:51.839
Yeah, it would free me up
to spend all my time

07:51.872 --> 07:53.040
going after Bixel Street.

07:53.073 --> 07:54.975
(chuckles)

07:55.008 --> 07:56.176
(chuckles)

07:56.209 --> 07:57.945
You know you go against me
in court.

07:57.978 --> 08:00.113
There's none of these
BS plea deals, right?

08:00.147 --> 08:03.150
It's federal--
it's 25 to life.

08:03.183 --> 08:05.285
You might want to be
thinking twice

08:05.318 --> 08:08.856
about your plans
to go after Mr. Smith.

08:13.961 --> 08:15.262
- Hey.
- COLBY: Hey.

08:15.295 --> 08:16.897
So, Heavy's parole
status prevented him

08:16.930 --> 08:18.866
from visiting
J-Light in prison,

08:18.899 --> 08:21.001
but it didn't stop
a guy named Levi Holt.

08:21.034 --> 08:23.136
48 visits in 12 months.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.872
Well, that's
how he's passing the orders?

08:24.905 --> 08:27.040
Thing is, this guy
Holt's the invisible man--

08:27.074 --> 08:29.309
no address, no license,
no nothing.

08:29.342 --> 08:31.979
And the phone number
on the log?

08:32.012 --> 08:35.583
Well, it traces back to a Los
Angeles recreation center.

08:35.616 --> 08:37.117
Wait, I know that place;

08:37.150 --> 08:38.986
that's where, uh,
David volunteers.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.121
Yeah, I don't think he's been
by in a while, though.

08:41.154 --> 08:43.557
Well, I'd say it's time.

08:43.591 --> 08:46.927
COLBY: So that's the big bad
Levi Holt, huh?

08:49.029 --> 08:52.700
Maybe I should take a pass
at this one alone.

08:52.733 --> 08:55.068
What's this--
a black and white thing?

08:55.102 --> 08:57.738
(chuckling):
Actually...

08:57.771 --> 09:03.143
it's a smooth and
a... unsmooth thing.

09:03.176 --> 09:04.344
Checkmate.

09:04.377 --> 09:05.979
That's ten dollars, B.

09:11.952 --> 09:13.053
Levi Holt?

09:13.086 --> 09:15.055
My friends know to call me
Bishop.

09:15.088 --> 09:17.190
Well, I'm
Special Agent David Sinclair.

09:17.224 --> 09:20.027
What exactly makes
you so special?

09:20.060 --> 09:21.762
I don't know.

09:21.795 --> 09:24.364
I guess it's the fact
that I talk to the dead.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.233
Yep. Just today,

09:26.266 --> 09:29.837
I had two dead guys tell me
a dude by the name of J-Light

09:29.870 --> 09:34.174
is responsible for
their untimely demise.

09:34.207 --> 09:36.109
According to this
log right here,

09:36.143 --> 09:38.145
not a week goes by

09:38.178 --> 09:41.248
that you don't
visit the man.

09:41.281 --> 09:42.983
Is that a crime?

09:45.152 --> 09:47.655
I'm giving you the courtesy
of doing this here, okay?

09:47.688 --> 09:49.823
Now, you want to have this
conversation in my office,

09:49.857 --> 09:51.859
I'd be more than happy
to call your mother.

09:51.892 --> 09:54.394
If you've seen my mom,

09:54.427 --> 09:56.163
then I'm really looking
at a psychic.

09:59.199 --> 10:03.203
Kid, what do you and J-Light
talk about every week?

10:03.236 --> 10:04.337
Chess.

10:04.371 --> 10:05.973
Chess?

10:06.006 --> 10:08.108
J-Light gives me lessons
so I'll stay sharp.

10:08.141 --> 10:10.143
He says
I'm some kind of prodigy.

10:10.177 --> 10:12.880
He's the only one that's
given a damn about me,

10:12.913 --> 10:14.948
so if you're looking
to take him down,

10:14.982 --> 10:16.116
you're in the wrong place.

10:24.024 --> 10:25.959
That was real
smooth, Jay-Z.

10:25.993 --> 10:29.997
Yeah... (sighs)

10:30.030 --> 10:32.199
AMITA: With more than 5,000 DOJ
e-mails

10:32.232 --> 10:36.069
connected to J-Light's trial,
your idea of creating

10:36.103 --> 10:39.339
a semantic network of terms
used in the training data set

10:39.372 --> 10:42.910
and matching them with their
e-mail uses was brilliant.

10:42.943 --> 10:44.812
When I'm stuck, I've always
found the work pattern

10:44.845 --> 10:46.379
of a certain Englishman
to be inspirational.

10:46.413 --> 10:48.181
Sir Isaac Newton.

10:48.215 --> 10:50.150
No, Sherlock Holmes.

10:50.183 --> 10:52.052
"From a drop of water, a
logician

10:52.085 --> 10:53.153
could infer the possibility

10:53.186 --> 10:57.157
"of an Atlantic or a Niagara
without ever having seen

10:57.190 --> 10:59.026
or heard of one or the other."

10:59.059 --> 11:02.229
But, yeah, Newton was
pretty good, too.

11:02.262 --> 11:03.296
Look at you guys.

11:03.330 --> 11:04.164
This is kind of like

11:04.197 --> 11:06.233
when Captain Kirk used
to beam down,

11:06.266 --> 11:08.769
and he would leave Bones
and Chekov in charge.

11:08.802 --> 11:11.138
No, actually, the chain
of command went, uh,

11:11.171 --> 11:13.240
Commander Spock
to Lieutenant Commander Scott

11:13.273 --> 11:15.275
to Lieutenant Sulu, and then,
once, during season two,

11:15.308 --> 11:18.211
it actually went to Assistant
Chief Engineer DeSalle.

11:18.245 --> 11:21.148
Uh, we ran an analysis
of all communications.

11:21.181 --> 11:24.184
Then we ran a second program
that looked for a break

11:24.217 --> 11:26.119
in the pattern of that user.

11:26.153 --> 11:31.024
And, uh, user number
zero-two-one-five-zero-two,

11:31.058 --> 11:32.425
stood out in stark contrast
to all the others,

11:32.459 --> 11:34.094
by far, requesting the most
information

11:34.127 --> 11:36.764
on all three witnesses.

11:36.797 --> 11:38.766
You sure about this?

11:38.799 --> 11:39.733
Quite.

11:39.767 --> 11:41.001
Why, is there
a problem?

11:43.503 --> 11:46.439
Okay, what is it
about this office?

11:52.813 --> 11:54.782
Hi.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.784
We've got a problem.

11:56.817 --> 11:58.786
Reggie Smith.

11:58.819 --> 12:00.020
No. You.

12:02.289 --> 12:04.224
I mean, you've been asking
a lot of questions

12:04.257 --> 12:05.859
about the dead witnesses.

12:06.994 --> 12:08.862
I'm the prosecuting attorney.

12:08.896 --> 12:12.199
Way too many inquiries
into their personal lives.

12:12.232 --> 12:15.102
Hold on.

12:15.135 --> 12:17.838
Are you really
suggesting

12:17.871 --> 12:19.539
that I'm on J-Light's payroll?

12:19.572 --> 12:21.541
We've got e-mails
from your computer

12:21.574 --> 12:23.343
for information
about prisoner transports.

12:23.376 --> 12:25.512
One to LAPD,
one changing

12:25.545 --> 12:27.848
Bell's train ticket,
so he got here an hour earlier.

12:27.881 --> 12:29.316
So, I mean,

12:29.349 --> 12:30.117
you tell me.

12:30.150 --> 12:31.985
Don, we spent six months
together.

12:32.019 --> 12:33.186
You know me.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.124
What are they doing?

12:37.157 --> 12:38.125
Don.

12:38.158 --> 12:40.260
I need an
official statement.

12:44.932 --> 12:46.834
Go to hell.

12:58.846 --> 13:00.848
Call me crazy,

13:00.881 --> 13:03.050
but Robin doesn't seem the
type to give up years

13:03.083 --> 13:05.152
of public service
for the dark side.

13:05.185 --> 13:07.387
DON: Hey, look, you gave me the
files.

13:07.420 --> 13:09.456
Don't you think you might
be a little bit biased

13:09.489 --> 13:11.124
because of your
past relationship?

13:11.158 --> 13:13.126
What am I
supposed to do?

13:13.160 --> 13:14.962
I don't know.

13:14.995 --> 13:16.396
But I can tell you,
after Colby,

13:16.429 --> 13:17.998
I never look

13:18.031 --> 13:19.532
at an investigation
the same way.

13:25.572 --> 13:28.308
(knocking on door)

13:28.341 --> 13:30.410
David, what a nice surprise.

13:30.443 --> 13:32.245
How you doing,
Mr. Eppes?

13:32.279 --> 13:33.947
Hey. You know, two gallons a day

13:33.981 --> 13:34.982
keeps the pipes
clean.

13:35.015 --> 13:36.416
Uh, no, this is
not for me,

13:36.449 --> 13:37.951
it's, uh, for
the toilet.

13:37.985 --> 13:39.452
I'm recycling
rainwater.

13:39.486 --> 13:41.521
The new system holds
up to 1,200 liters.

13:41.554 --> 13:42.956
Oh, by the way, if you're
looking for Don--

13:42.990 --> 13:43.423
Actually,

13:43.456 --> 13:44.257
I need... you.

13:44.291 --> 13:45.492
or even Charlie-- I can't help
you.

13:45.525 --> 13:46.559
Me?

13:46.593 --> 13:48.896
How long does it take to learn
how to play chess?

13:48.929 --> 13:50.097
Years.

13:50.130 --> 13:52.866
I only have this afternoon.

13:54.101 --> 13:55.635
Well, I guess we'd
better get started.

13:55.668 --> 13:58.205
Oh, uh, by the way,

13:58.238 --> 14:00.140
speed chess is just
the name of the game.

14:00.173 --> 14:01.608
It's not how long it
takes to learn it.

14:01.641 --> 14:03.543
Yeah.

14:08.681 --> 14:10.884
Hey, so Gary Bell
received a call.

14:10.918 --> 14:13.120
It was from this
number right here.

14:13.153 --> 14:14.254
The phone was cloned.

14:14.287 --> 14:15.488
Whoever killed him.

14:15.522 --> 14:16.523
NSA has got this new technology

14:16.556 --> 14:18.291
where you can download media
from a cell phone

14:18.325 --> 14:19.927
without the owner
ever realizing,

14:19.960 --> 14:22.395
so we were able to pull
down these two pictures

14:22.429 --> 14:24.998
that were sent to
the killer's phone.

14:25.032 --> 14:27.000
Bell.

14:27.034 --> 14:28.001
And the next one's
still a mystery,

14:28.035 --> 14:30.037
'cause we weren't able
to download all of it.

14:30.070 --> 14:31.471
Yeah, you remember
Charlie helped us

14:31.504 --> 14:34.441
find that plane with the shadows
of the sun or something?

14:34.474 --> 14:35.375
Yeah.

14:38.645 --> 14:40.613
Eppes, you're up.

14:40.647 --> 14:42.549
Prisoner escort.

14:46.586 --> 14:48.922
Please follow me, sir.

14:49.722 --> 14:52.025
(groans)

14:54.161 --> 14:55.062
(chuckles)

14:58.031 --> 15:00.633
Okay, buddy, walk it off, huh?

15:03.971 --> 15:05.405
Paul, give me
a second here.

15:05.438 --> 15:06.706
PAUL:
No problem.

15:06.739 --> 15:08.408
This is good.
This is going,

15:08.441 --> 15:10.243
I mean I feel really good
about the whole thing.

15:10.277 --> 15:11.244
Yeah, I can see that.

15:11.278 --> 15:12.980
Look, uh, do me a favor.

15:13.013 --> 15:14.547
Think you can dial us
into where this is?

15:14.581 --> 15:16.183
Yeah. Yeah, uh...

15:18.085 --> 15:21.154
Okay, so,
supervised multiclass labeling.

15:21.188 --> 15:22.155
Mm-hmm.

15:22.189 --> 15:24.391
Picture a cadaver dog
searching for a body.

15:24.424 --> 15:27.160
If you give the dog a photo of
the subject, that's useless.

15:27.194 --> 15:29.062
But if you give the dog a piece
of the subject's clothing,

15:29.096 --> 15:31.464
it's going to key off
the scent.

15:31.498 --> 15:33.100
SML algorithm works the same.

15:33.133 --> 15:35.969
It looks for its own scent
or information

15:36.003 --> 15:38.171
by scanning millions of images
on the Internet

15:38.205 --> 15:39.072
and finding a match.

15:39.106 --> 15:40.207
All right, great.

15:40.240 --> 15:41.074
- So...
- I'm going

15:41.108 --> 15:43.543
to need to call Amita
and Larry again.

15:43.576 --> 15:44.544
Hey, Eppes!

15:44.577 --> 15:45.712
You done yapping?

15:45.745 --> 15:47.514
You're up.

15:47.547 --> 15:48.648
You got any advice
for me here?

15:48.681 --> 15:51.318
Yeah, just shake his hand
and kick him in the nuts.

15:51.351 --> 15:53.620
Same advice you gave me
in elementary school.

15:53.653 --> 15:55.322
- Well, it worked then, right?
- Yeah.

15:57.724 --> 16:00.760
Now, uh, this tactic
is called a "pin."

16:00.793 --> 16:03.096
By the way, who is
your adversary?

16:03.130 --> 16:05.432
Uh, it's
a 14-year-old kid.

16:05.465 --> 16:06.733
Uh...

16:06.766 --> 16:11.004
his mom died, now he, uh,
idolizes a gang leader.

16:11.038 --> 16:12.105
Well, having raised

16:12.139 --> 16:14.141
two boys myself--
I can tell you

16:14.174 --> 16:16.676
that age, it's a difficult time
for any teen.

16:18.811 --> 16:20.647
I don't mean to be rude,
Mr. Eppes,

16:20.680 --> 16:22.282
but I seriously doubt

16:22.315 --> 16:24.684
Don or Charlie ever had to,
you know,

16:24.717 --> 16:26.519
wonder where their next meal was
coming from, you know?

16:26.553 --> 16:28.255
Yeah, well,

16:28.288 --> 16:29.489
the pressure
to be a man,

16:29.522 --> 16:31.658
the need for guidance--

16:31.691 --> 16:33.660
doesn't know
any income brackets.

16:40.400 --> 16:42.769
DAVID:
Knight to C3.

16:44.704 --> 16:47.107
Aah... Damn it.

16:47.140 --> 16:48.375
At least
it's not porn.

16:48.408 --> 16:49.809
DAVID: That'd be Granger's
computer.

16:49.842 --> 16:52.045
Only on Saturday nights.

16:52.079 --> 16:53.680
Oh, boy.

16:53.713 --> 16:55.182
So, Robin Brooks' office

16:55.215 --> 16:57.450
subcontracts all
their I.T. work.

16:57.484 --> 16:58.818
I see right here
she had her computer serviced

16:58.851 --> 17:01.521
six times
in the past year.

17:01.554 --> 17:03.156
Look at this:
Five of the service calls

17:03.190 --> 17:04.524
were the same tech--
Angie Heath.

17:04.557 --> 17:06.693
I can't believe the
International Olympic Committee

17:06.726 --> 17:08.595
actually considers
this a sport.

17:08.628 --> 17:10.697
I can't believe you're
this bad at it.

17:10.730 --> 17:11.364
COLBY:
Here we go.

17:11.398 --> 17:13.233
4-5-9,
we got a burglary.

17:13.266 --> 17:14.634
Hey,

17:14.667 --> 17:16.536
look who she's arrested with.

17:16.569 --> 17:19.772
Reggie Smith,
our missing witness.

17:19.806 --> 17:21.741
Says they're married,

17:21.774 --> 17:23.710
and divorced a year later.

17:24.844 --> 17:27.247
Okay, so,

17:27.280 --> 17:29.382
Angie steals the information
from Robin's computer,

17:29.416 --> 17:31.251
passes it to J-Light

17:31.284 --> 17:33.386
- who orders the hit from jail.
- Until her ex-husband

17:33.420 --> 17:34.854
becomes the next target.

17:34.887 --> 17:38.391
She gets nostalgic,
goes ahead and tips him off.

17:38.425 --> 17:41.128
$50 says if we find Angie,
Reggie Smith is laying

17:41.161 --> 17:42.095
right there next to her.

17:42.129 --> 17:44.331
Well, last known address
is a loft downtown.

18:14.161 --> 18:16.263
The size of the entry wound,

18:16.296 --> 18:18.298
I'm betting
that's a .22 caliber.

18:18.331 --> 18:20.300
The same caliber
that killed Bell.

18:20.333 --> 18:22.469
Another contract
killing.

18:22.502 --> 18:24.371
Now, how did J-Light find them?

18:24.404 --> 18:26.539
I don't know.

18:26.573 --> 18:28.708
But you shoot somebody
in the kneecaps,

18:28.741 --> 18:30.109
you're making a point.

18:34.514 --> 18:36.483
Oh, so you heard?

18:36.516 --> 18:38.485
I don't care, Don.

18:38.518 --> 18:39.786
Robin, come on.

18:39.819 --> 18:41.854
I mean, what, you would've
done the same thing.

18:41.888 --> 18:43.856
No, I wouldn't have.

18:43.890 --> 18:45.858
I would have thought
about who you are,

18:45.892 --> 18:47.327
and trusted my gut.

18:49.462 --> 18:51.664
And so would
the Don Eppes I knew.

18:54.501 --> 18:55.802
Here's the weird thing:

18:55.835 --> 18:57.470
Angie Heath's last five
phone calls,

18:57.504 --> 19:01.308
they were all to J-Light's
top lieutenant, Heavy.

19:01.341 --> 19:03.676
Now, why would she call the
people trying to kill her?

19:03.710 --> 19:04.944
What's that in her mouth?

19:04.977 --> 19:06.313
That's a hundred-dollar bill.

19:06.346 --> 19:08.181
Each one had one stuffed
in their mouth.

19:08.215 --> 19:09.749
I think it's a message
of some kind.

19:09.782 --> 19:11.884
No, they're tying
to buy their freedom.

19:11.918 --> 19:13.920
It's more
like an answer.

19:13.953 --> 19:16.656
DON (laughing):
Whoa!

19:16.689 --> 19:17.424
Check it out.

19:17.457 --> 19:18.891
CHARLIE:
Hey.

19:18.925 --> 19:20.727
We're doing dynamic entries.

19:20.760 --> 19:22.595
That's when you break into
a typical hostage situation.

19:22.629 --> 19:23.263
Yeah, I think we know a thing
or two about it.

19:23.296 --> 19:24.364
Gave you a machine gun, huh?

19:24.397 --> 19:25.565
It fires paint pellets

19:25.598 --> 19:26.866
instead of bullets,

19:26.899 --> 19:29.769
but as I've learned,
those can be very painful.

19:29.802 --> 19:30.837
Especially
when they get

19:30.870 --> 19:32.305
- under your skin.
- So,

19:32.339 --> 19:33.673
what can we do for you, Rambo?

19:33.706 --> 19:34.907
- Oh, right.
- I'm here because, um...

19:34.941 --> 19:35.742
- Whoa, whoa.
- Wait just...

19:35.775 --> 19:37.277
Point it down.
Just point it down.

19:37.310 --> 19:38.378
Stupid thing.

19:38.411 --> 19:39.279
Uh, Larry

19:39.312 --> 19:40.947
and Amita have found

19:40.980 --> 19:42.682
a match for your photograph.

19:42.715 --> 19:43.883
Here we go.

19:43.916 --> 19:45.518
Uh...

19:45.552 --> 19:46.819
I don't know the significance,

19:46.853 --> 19:48.421
but it's somewhere
in the Valley.

19:50.257 --> 19:51.224
Wait, what, you're kidding.

19:51.258 --> 19:52.225
That's Robin's house.

19:52.259 --> 19:53.326
What?

19:53.360 --> 19:54.361
She's the next target.

20:04.271 --> 20:05.738
(knocking on door)

20:13.480 --> 20:14.947
DON: Hey, what do you say, Jim?

20:14.981 --> 20:16.048
JIM: Hi.

20:16.082 --> 20:17.350
All right, I got it.
I'll see you in a little while.

20:17.384 --> 20:17.717
See you in a bit.

20:22.021 --> 20:24.357
I remember we talked

20:24.391 --> 20:26.826
about spending a weekend
someplace like this.

20:26.859 --> 20:28.528
Didn't think it would be with

20:28.561 --> 20:30.397
an hourly
changing of the guards.

20:30.430 --> 20:32.399
With Smith dead, the only thing
we got to convict J-Light

20:32.432 --> 20:33.566
is that dying declaration
you took.

20:33.600 --> 20:35.802
Which is a nice way
of saying I'm next

20:35.835 --> 20:36.903
on the hit list.

20:36.936 --> 20:37.870
Well, that's not going
to happen.

20:37.904 --> 20:39.506
So now you're on my side?

20:39.539 --> 20:41.508
I don't choose sides.

20:41.541 --> 20:42.975
Come on, you know that.

20:44.511 --> 20:46.313
You can be
a real bastard sometimes.

20:46.346 --> 20:49.048
My shrink said
something like that.

20:49.081 --> 20:50.750
This shrink...

20:50.783 --> 20:52.952
has he taught you how to say
"I was wrong" yet?

20:58.791 --> 21:02.495
So, Gary Bell was the
first witness killed.

21:02.529 --> 21:04.297
Two people have I.D.'d
this woman

21:04.331 --> 21:06.733
as walking with him
minutes before he was shot.

21:06.766 --> 21:09.369
Courtesy of Interpol--
her name's Coral.

21:09.402 --> 21:10.903
She's a contract killer
for the Albanian mob.

21:10.937 --> 21:12.572
Well, I guess,
with his own crew

21:12.605 --> 21:13.806
testifying against him,

21:13.840 --> 21:15.542
J-Light didn't want to trust
the locals

21:15.575 --> 21:16.609
to do the job.

21:16.643 --> 21:18.811
Which means we still have
a professional hit woman

21:18.845 --> 21:20.046
running around town.

21:23.583 --> 21:24.884
(footfalls)

21:24.917 --> 21:26.886
(Charlie clears
his throat)

21:26.919 --> 21:28.688
Oh!

21:28.721 --> 21:30.823
Oh. I take it

21:30.857 --> 21:33.760
the tactical assault
didn't go too well.

21:33.793 --> 21:35.862
According to
my instructor,

21:35.895 --> 21:37.697
in the event
of a firefight,

21:37.730 --> 21:39.532
my best course of
action would be

21:39.566 --> 21:41.701
to get in a fetal
position and

21:41.734 --> 21:43.470
call for my mama.

21:43.503 --> 21:45.505
Well, that's
rather ironic.

21:45.538 --> 21:47.540
My flight instructor told me
the same thing.

21:47.574 --> 21:49.476
Thanks to my brother,

21:49.509 --> 21:51.844
the Eppes name has
some reputation around the FBI.

21:51.878 --> 21:53.513
Oh, rather, thanks
to both of you.

21:53.546 --> 21:55.014
And I don't want
to tarnish either one of them.

21:55.047 --> 21:57.450
I think I'm in
over my head here.

21:57.484 --> 21:58.785
I mean, some
of these guys are animals.

21:58.818 --> 21:59.986
How did he put it?

22:00.019 --> 22:02.955
"Strength comes not
from physical capacity,

22:02.989 --> 22:04.991
but from
indomitable will."

22:05.024 --> 22:08.528
Yeah, well, Gandhi never
had to lead an HRT.

22:08.561 --> 22:09.829
Mm, no.

22:09.862 --> 22:12.031
I'm used to a certain level
of success.

22:12.064 --> 22:13.800
These guys are laughing at me.

22:13.833 --> 22:15.468
You know, Charlie,

22:15.502 --> 22:17.136
think back now

22:17.169 --> 22:19.739
to when you were a 13-year-old
freshman at Princeton.

22:19.772 --> 22:22.675
There were plenty of your
fellow students who were

22:22.709 --> 22:24.544
keenly jealous of you.

22:24.577 --> 22:26.913
This your way of telling me
I was hated?

22:26.946 --> 22:28.147
(laughing)
Well... no.

22:28.180 --> 22:29.982
I mean, hated is a strong word.

22:30.016 --> 22:31.150
(sputters quietly)

22:31.183 --> 22:32.619
Uh, detested.

22:32.652 --> 22:33.786
(wry laugh)

22:33.820 --> 22:35.154
But you won
their respect.

22:35.187 --> 22:37.790
You did, with your integrity,

22:37.824 --> 22:40.827
your kind soul, and
most importantly of all,

22:40.860 --> 22:44.130
you were smarter
than every single one of 'em.

22:44.163 --> 22:45.832
Now, listen to me.

22:45.865 --> 22:47.033
You have a gift.

22:47.066 --> 22:49.702
So, where does it say

22:49.736 --> 22:52.572
your brain must only
be used for math?

22:55.942 --> 22:58.445
Checkmate.

23:03.883 --> 23:05.852
Are you for real?

23:05.885 --> 23:07.787
Only one way to find out.

23:09.822 --> 23:11.558
Okay.

23:11.591 --> 23:12.725
You can go first.

23:12.759 --> 23:14.627
You're white. You go first.

23:14.661 --> 23:15.928
It's the rules.

23:15.962 --> 23:17.096
Right.

23:17.129 --> 23:18.531
I knew that.

23:22.902 --> 23:24.571
Come on, man.
I got a life to lead.

23:28.475 --> 23:30.176
Your move.

23:34.847 --> 23:36.749
(sighs)

23:41.754 --> 23:43.022
Checkmate.

23:47.026 --> 23:49.061
- It's your money.
- Let's go.

23:49.095 --> 23:50.162
(scoffs)

23:50.196 --> 23:52.064
All right...

23:55.001 --> 23:56.503
Checkmate.

23:57.970 --> 23:59.205
Had enough?

24:01.708 --> 24:03.710
You know,
my dad used to play chess.

24:04.977 --> 24:06.879
Must not have been any good.

24:06.913 --> 24:08.915
Actually, he was
the, uh, champion

24:08.948 --> 24:10.883
of the Botanical Gardens.

24:10.917 --> 24:12.184
It was kind of

24:12.218 --> 24:13.953
like the MacArthur Park
in my neighborhood.

24:13.986 --> 24:15.922
Maybe you ought to call him
for some lessons.

24:15.955 --> 24:16.889
Yeah, I wish
I could.

24:16.923 --> 24:18.891
My dad passed away

24:18.925 --> 24:20.927
when I was right
about your age.

24:20.960 --> 24:22.962
Better than him
not being there at all.

24:22.995 --> 24:26.198
Not easy being the man
of the house, is it?

24:26.232 --> 24:28.868
But, Bishop, part
of being a man

24:28.901 --> 24:30.870
is taking responsibility
for your actions.

24:30.903 --> 24:32.939
J-Light is good with me.

24:32.972 --> 24:34.607
I don't concern myself

24:34.641 --> 24:35.975
with his other stuff.

24:36.008 --> 24:37.944
Ah, but you should,

24:37.977 --> 24:39.912
'cause sooner or later,
that stuff--

24:39.946 --> 24:42.048
it has a way
of catching up with you.

24:42.081 --> 24:43.149
Okay?

24:43.182 --> 24:44.884
All right, now,

24:44.917 --> 24:47.153
I looked at the security
video from the prison.

24:47.186 --> 24:48.888
That notebook
you carry around...

24:48.921 --> 24:51.023
Look, I need to know
what's inside of it.

25:06.072 --> 25:08.007
Chess.

25:08.040 --> 25:09.942
Must be real lousy being you,

25:09.976 --> 25:11.878
never being able
to trust anyone.

25:17.183 --> 25:19.819
It's not true--

25:19.852 --> 25:23.022
what you said before
about not choosing sides.

25:23.055 --> 25:24.957
You do it all the time.

25:24.991 --> 25:26.593
That had nothing to do with us.

25:28.027 --> 25:29.829
I mean, I'll give you--
you did mess me up

25:29.862 --> 25:30.963
pretty good.

25:30.997 --> 25:33.833
Things get too close, I kind of
got a habit of running.

25:33.866 --> 25:34.934
That's funny.
I thought that was my MO.

25:34.967 --> 25:36.869
Maybe that's why
we worked for a while.

25:39.071 --> 25:42.108
All right, so, you know,
what was it, ultimately?

25:44.777 --> 25:47.346
You remember when I was sleeping
over all the time,

25:47.379 --> 25:49.215
and you gave
me that drawer?

25:49.248 --> 25:50.950
Yeah.

25:50.983 --> 25:53.820
The only thing you kept
in it was a hair clip.

25:53.853 --> 25:56.989
Well, I showed up
for work one day

25:57.023 --> 25:59.926
and realized that
I took the hair clip with me.

25:59.959 --> 26:02.762
(Nextel crackles to life)

26:02.795 --> 26:04.831
Hey, Don, it's Jimmy,
here to relieve you.

26:04.864 --> 26:06.232
Be at the door in two secs.

26:06.265 --> 26:08.034
Yeah, all right, Jimmy.

26:08.067 --> 26:10.136
(sighs)

26:10.169 --> 26:12.071
Well, I'll see you
in a little while.

26:21.147 --> 26:22.248
Nice!

26:22.281 --> 26:23.783
Nice shooting.

26:23.816 --> 26:25.752
275.

26:25.785 --> 26:27.386
Highest yet.

26:27.419 --> 26:29.088
Next group up.

26:37.964 --> 26:40.099
Eyes and ears
in place.

26:41.200 --> 26:43.235
Line is hot.

26:44.370 --> 26:46.673
Ready on the firing line.

27:01.053 --> 27:03.389
(gun clicks,
target lines whirring)

27:13.132 --> 27:14.867
I can't believe it.

27:14.901 --> 27:18.304
296. High score.

27:20.006 --> 27:22.041
How'd you do it?

27:22.074 --> 27:24.276
Some kind of
math formula?

27:24.310 --> 27:28.080
"Fast is fine,
but accuracy is final.

27:28.114 --> 27:32.284
You need to learn to
be slow in a hurry."

27:32.318 --> 27:34.721
Wyatt Earp.

27:44.764 --> 27:46.733
Your dinner
is served, madame.

27:52.171 --> 27:54.273
Your table.

27:58.878 --> 28:00.179
Here you are.

28:00.212 --> 28:02.782
Need to get the number
for your shrink, thank him.

28:02.815 --> 28:04.250
VoilГ !

28:06.385 --> 28:09.355
What's this?

28:09.388 --> 28:11.090
Uh, that would be for you.

28:15.061 --> 28:16.963
A hair clip.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.134
Come here.

28:23.269 --> 28:24.904
(Nextel chirps)

28:24.937 --> 28:26.072
Ah.

28:26.105 --> 28:27.506
Don, it's Jimmy.
I'm outside the door.

28:27.539 --> 28:28.875
Security is ready for you.

28:28.908 --> 28:30.409
You got to
be kidding.

28:30.442 --> 28:31.744
I'm on the clock.

28:31.778 --> 28:32.779
What am I gonna do?

28:32.812 --> 28:35.081
I got to walk the grounds
with hotel security.

28:35.114 --> 28:36.715
I will be back--
I promise, okay?

28:41.220 --> 28:42.354
Oh, hey.

28:42.388 --> 28:44.423
Oh, I'm so glad
you guys are here.

28:44.456 --> 28:46.125
Are you busy?

28:46.158 --> 28:49.028
Oh, I'm just trying to find the
existence of a massive scalar

28:49.061 --> 28:51.163
elementary particle,
predicted to exist

28:51.197 --> 28:54.066
by the standard model
of particle physics.

28:54.100 --> 28:56.402
Cool. Well, when you're done,
do you think you'll have time

28:56.435 --> 28:58.237
to look at this?

28:58.270 --> 29:00.272
A list of murder victims.

29:00.306 --> 29:01.273
Mm-hmm.

29:01.307 --> 29:02.441
Who is J-Light?

29:02.474 --> 29:04.276
Uh, the person who
wrote the list,

29:04.310 --> 29:06.012
who ordered the
murders from jail.

29:06.045 --> 29:07.814
Well, he must
have been monitored.

29:07.847 --> 29:10.116
He is, so we think
he's using a code.

29:10.149 --> 29:11.283
David thinks

29:11.317 --> 29:13.052
he's passing the code
to this kid

29:13.085 --> 29:14.887
while he's teaching him
chess lessons.

29:14.921 --> 29:16.322
AMITA:
Well,

29:16.355 --> 29:17.890
the beautiful thing about chess

29:17.924 --> 29:19.291
is that both opponents
know everything.

29:19.325 --> 29:20.860
Nothing's hidden.

29:22.261 --> 29:26.198
So within the lesson,
perhaps the coded

29:26.232 --> 29:28.167
message lies.

29:28.200 --> 29:29.969
If that's the case,
can you crack it?

29:30.002 --> 29:31.303
I don't know.
I mean, normally,

29:31.337 --> 29:32.271
we'd need a
cipher, but..

29:32.304 --> 29:33.840
Yeah, but in this case,

29:33.873 --> 29:35.942
we have the victims' names
or the results,

29:35.975 --> 29:37.309
so by using backwards induction,

29:37.343 --> 29:39.311
we might be able
to crack it.

29:39.345 --> 29:41.848
It's like the Rosetta Stone:

29:41.881 --> 29:43.149
The same exact text
is written

29:43.182 --> 29:45.384
in three different languages.

29:45.417 --> 29:48.487
So, if you can understand
just one,

29:48.520 --> 29:51.323
then you should
be able to read

29:51.357 --> 29:52.925
the other two.

29:52.959 --> 29:56.095
My algorithm will be looking
for overlaps

29:56.128 --> 29:57.429
between the sets of data--

29:57.463 --> 30:01.233
the victims
and the chess lessons.

30:01.267 --> 30:02.568
Then I'll translate
the unknown code

30:02.601 --> 30:04.470
by comparing it
to the known murders

30:04.503 --> 30:06.906
and their gang affiliations.

30:06.939 --> 30:09.541
Great. Sorry to blow off
those elementary particles.

30:09.575 --> 30:11.177
Oh, anytime.

30:13.212 --> 30:14.380
(door opening)

30:17.349 --> 30:19.085
Help yourself.

30:19.118 --> 30:20.319
I'm gonna go work.

30:20.352 --> 30:22.154
Thanks.

30:35.267 --> 30:36.435
(sniffles)

31:08.334 --> 31:10.402
Robin, run!

31:10.436 --> 31:12.504
(grunts)

31:14.706 --> 31:16.008
(gasps)

31:17.143 --> 31:17.509
(grunts)

31:33.659 --> 31:36.195
3696.
Need immediate assistance.

31:36.228 --> 31:37.496
I've been stabbed.

31:37.529 --> 31:40.332
Subject is a female Caucasian
armed with a knife.

31:40.366 --> 31:42.334
She's in pursuit
of my protectee.

31:42.368 --> 31:43.102
(panting)

31:48.740 --> 31:49.308
(gunfire)

32:20.739 --> 32:22.608
(people chattering and laughing)

32:22.641 --> 32:24.310
(party music playing)

32:24.343 --> 32:26.245
(gasps)

32:26.278 --> 32:29.281
Somebody help!
Somebody help me, please!

32:30.149 --> 32:31.450
(gunfire)

32:35.087 --> 32:36.288
All right, all right.
(gasps)

32:36.322 --> 32:37.656
You all right?

32:37.689 --> 32:39.091
Okay, come on, come on.

32:39.125 --> 32:40.026
I got you.

32:40.059 --> 32:43.029
I thought I was...

32:43.062 --> 32:44.730
How did you find me?

32:44.763 --> 32:46.532
I had a little help.

32:46.565 --> 32:47.533
I don't understand.

32:47.566 --> 32:48.467
Tracking device.

32:51.103 --> 32:53.605
J-Light's not going
to stop until...

32:53.639 --> 32:55.641
He's not going to get you.

33:04.516 --> 33:07.253
So I talked to the hospital;
Jimmy's out of surgery.

33:07.286 --> 33:10.522
He's going
to be okay.

33:10.556 --> 33:13.525
Kid got to you
a little bit, huh?

33:13.559 --> 33:15.694
Treating him like
any other perp.

33:15.727 --> 33:18.197
Yeah, but he's not.

33:18.230 --> 33:20.366
I grew up with kids
like him, you know?

33:20.399 --> 33:23.169
I've seen the way
this movie ends.

33:23.202 --> 33:24.603
Doesn't sound like
any other perp.

33:25.737 --> 33:28.274
Okay.

33:28.307 --> 33:31.043
You have all the answers,
let's hear it.

33:31.077 --> 33:32.644
(sighs)

33:32.678 --> 33:35.381
Well, why don't you just stop
pretending you don't give a crap

33:35.414 --> 33:36.448
and change the damn ending?

33:44.356 --> 33:45.557
Hey.

33:45.591 --> 33:46.625
- How's it going?
- Welcome back.

33:46.658 --> 33:47.559
CHARLIE:
Thank you.

33:47.593 --> 33:48.560
Aah... please.

33:48.594 --> 33:49.528
- What?
- My ribs.

33:49.561 --> 33:51.597
- Sorry.
- Yeah, it's okay.

33:51.630 --> 33:52.464
- Ow.
- Oh.

33:52.498 --> 33:55.234
Um, I just think
I may have split my lip.

33:55.267 --> 33:56.602
Okay.

33:56.635 --> 33:57.636
What's that?

33:57.669 --> 33:58.870
Oh, this is just

33:58.904 --> 34:02.508
a little certificate stating
my marksmanship qualifications.

34:02.541 --> 34:04.676
LARRY (quietly):
Yay!

34:04.710 --> 34:07.179
I am very impressed with you
for doing this, Charlie.

34:07.213 --> 34:08.714
Thank you.

34:08.747 --> 34:10.516
So, dimensional data sets.

34:10.549 --> 34:12.684
Each week,
this man J-Light

34:12.718 --> 34:14.653
teaches his
protГ©gГ© Bishop

34:14.686 --> 34:15.654
a chess lesson.

34:15.687 --> 34:17.089
Now, David thinks

34:17.123 --> 34:19.291
a code is maybe being passed

34:19.325 --> 34:20.559
- within the lesson.
- I've run a computer program

34:20.592 --> 34:22.561
to try to analyze
all optimal chess moves,

34:22.594 --> 34:27.299
and... I still can't break
the cipher.

34:27.333 --> 34:28.634
Hmm.

34:28.667 --> 34:29.735
CHARLIE:
Well...

34:29.768 --> 34:33.439
in my FBI profiling seminar,

34:33.472 --> 34:37.276
we learned that the notion
of "thinking like a criminal"

34:37.309 --> 34:38.677
is actually a misnomer

34:38.710 --> 34:40.512
because criminals
are sociopaths,

34:40.546 --> 34:42.681
and in order to match
wits with them,

34:42.714 --> 34:43.849
you actually
have to think

34:43.882 --> 34:46.084
contrary to your
normal thought process.

34:49.221 --> 34:51.357
So we've been
assuming that J-Light

34:51.390 --> 34:55.261
was teaching Bishop all
the optimal moves when...

34:55.294 --> 34:58.797
It may have been
just the opposite.

35:02.801 --> 35:03.835
Coral tracked Robin

35:03.869 --> 35:05.271
by the GPS on her Blackberry.

35:05.304 --> 35:06.272
That's pretty smart.

35:06.305 --> 35:09.441
Don has SWAT
watching her 24-7.

35:09.475 --> 35:11.543
Okay,
so we figured out the code.

35:11.577 --> 35:13.279
Or they figured out the code.

35:13.312 --> 35:14.680
So each week,
during their lesson,

35:14.713 --> 35:15.614
J-Light teaches Bishop

35:15.647 --> 35:18.584
one move or countermove
for him to master.

35:18.617 --> 35:20.619
When decoded, they reveal
a direct order from J-Light.

35:20.652 --> 35:25.157
Each of the 64 squares
represents a different gang.

35:25.191 --> 35:26.625
Now, the king's
last position

35:26.658 --> 35:28.694
shows which gang
was being targeted.

35:28.727 --> 35:29.695
And the piece used

35:29.728 --> 35:31.297
to checkmate indicates how high

35:31.330 --> 35:32.231
in the organization.

35:32.264 --> 35:34.566
For example, this lesson
featured an attack

35:34.600 --> 35:37.269
on the black center
by means of an E4 to D5 advance,

35:37.303 --> 35:39.571
indicating
that a pawn,

35:39.605 --> 35:40.772
or low-level gangbanger,

35:40.806 --> 35:44.176
in the Midtown Highboys
should be killed.

35:44.210 --> 35:46.278
If we can figure out
J-Light's next chess lesson,

35:46.312 --> 35:47.646
we can figure out his next hit.

35:52.218 --> 35:54.186
Hey.

35:54.220 --> 35:55.387
Game's over.

35:55.421 --> 35:56.488
You, get lost.

35:56.522 --> 35:57.889
What's your problem?

35:57.923 --> 35:59.191
Where's your notebook?

35:59.225 --> 36:00.759
It belongs
to me.

36:00.792 --> 36:02.461
It's evidence that'll be used
against you in your murder trial

36:02.494 --> 36:03.695
if you don't give it to me right
now.

36:03.729 --> 36:05.664
Look if you're trying to scare
me, it's not going to work.

36:05.697 --> 36:06.665
I'm not trying
to scare you, okay?

36:06.698 --> 36:08.267
I'm trying to help you.

36:08.300 --> 36:09.701
I know what happens
to kids like you.

36:09.735 --> 36:12.571
Oh, so now you think me and
you are from the same place?

36:12.604 --> 36:13.772
Well, we ain't.

36:13.805 --> 36:16.275
(both scoff)
Yeah, you're right,

36:16.308 --> 36:19.445
because I grew up
with a family

36:19.478 --> 36:21.680
that loved and supported me,

36:21.713 --> 36:22.781
so we're not the same,

36:22.814 --> 36:24.983
but you're also wrong--
'cause I do care about you.

36:25.016 --> 36:27.886
I want to see you become the
man that I know you can be.

36:27.919 --> 36:30.622
The man
your father never was.

36:33.325 --> 36:36.995
One day, me and this kid got
into this thing at school.

36:37.028 --> 36:38.930
I had to wait in the
principal's office

36:38.964 --> 36:40.866
until my dad showed up.

36:40.899 --> 36:43.602
He never did.

36:43.635 --> 36:45.304
J-Light came instead.

36:47.439 --> 36:49.875
And what about Heavy?

36:49.908 --> 36:51.777
It never seemed
strange to you--

36:51.810 --> 36:53.479
his passion
for your chess lessons?

36:54.913 --> 36:56.782
Bishop, every time
he reads your notebook,

36:56.815 --> 36:58.350
somebody else out here dies.

36:58.384 --> 37:00.786
Now, come on, kid.

37:00.819 --> 37:03.822
I am not that dumb...

37:03.855 --> 37:05.757
and you're way too smart.

37:15.967 --> 37:19.838
DAVID (over phone):
Second move, white, 2 to C4.

37:19.871 --> 37:22.841
Okay, now I'm positive
it's the GrГјnfeld Defense.

37:22.874 --> 37:24.843
Uh, no, I'm positive
it's Sicilian, I'm positive.

37:24.876 --> 37:26.512
Where do you even see Sicilian?

37:26.545 --> 37:27.212
How can it possibly be...

37:27.245 --> 37:29.315
It's the Nimzo-Indian Defense.

37:29.348 --> 37:32.918
The proper reply is pawn to E6,
freeing up the king's bishop.

37:32.951 --> 37:34.753
David, this is gonna take
a minute here.

37:34.786 --> 37:35.954
CHARLIE: All right, I'll punch
those variations in.

37:37.423 --> 37:39.558
And I shall watch.

37:41.527 --> 37:42.928
Here we go.

37:42.961 --> 37:44.363
Bishop to B6.

37:44.396 --> 37:47.899
And the proper
response is...

37:49.668 --> 37:51.670
So, the Bixel Street Boys.

37:51.703 --> 37:52.838
That's J-Light's own gang.

37:55.474 --> 37:58.910
Like a modern day
Rosencrantz and Guildenstern,

37:58.944 --> 38:01.347
that boy is delivering
his own death letter.

38:01.380 --> 38:03.515
David, he's sending an order
to kill Bishop.

38:06.452 --> 38:07.786
Hey, let's go.

38:07.819 --> 38:10.722
Up, let's go.

38:12.658 --> 38:16.428
(car stereo blaring rap song)

38:16.462 --> 38:17.729
(brakes screeching)

38:19.931 --> 38:22.534
You stand right
here, okay?

38:22.568 --> 38:23.635
You don't move.

38:24.803 --> 38:26.838
- Yo, Bish.
- What up, Heavy?

38:26.872 --> 38:28.774
- What up, Bone?
- Why didn't you come by

38:28.807 --> 38:29.808
with the book?

38:29.841 --> 38:30.776
I've been waiting for an hour.

38:34.946 --> 38:36.848
You have something to say?

38:36.882 --> 38:38.817
- Say it.
- FBI.

38:38.850 --> 38:40.919
(laughs)

38:42.388 --> 38:44.356
This ain't gonna end
real good for you.

38:45.857 --> 38:47.993
Walk away.

38:48.026 --> 38:48.994
That's not gonna happen.

38:49.027 --> 38:50.862
I said walk away.

38:57.703 --> 38:59.771
What are you
strapping?

38:59.805 --> 39:00.939
A nine?

39:00.972 --> 39:01.940
What's that?

39:01.973 --> 39:04.676
15, 16 rounds?

39:04.710 --> 39:05.711
Me and Bone right here,

39:05.744 --> 39:07.979
we're nice
with the trigger.

39:08.013 --> 39:09.781
Our gats are
four times that action.

39:09.815 --> 39:11.983
And homeboy's got plenty more
in the car.

39:12.017 --> 39:14.786
You'll be ghost in two seconds.

39:14.820 --> 39:15.854
Well, you better hope so.

39:15.887 --> 39:17.889
If I get off even one shot,

39:17.923 --> 39:19.525
it's going right
between your eyes.

39:19.558 --> 39:21.993
Well, I guess we're gonna have
to find out then, huh?

39:22.027 --> 39:24.796
Yeah, we're also gonna find out
if you're ready to run,

39:24.830 --> 39:26.031
because
after you kill

39:26.064 --> 39:27.433
a federal agent,

39:27.466 --> 39:28.967
ain't no corner
on this man's Earth

39:29.000 --> 39:30.669
that's gonna be far
enough for you to hide in.

39:32.771 --> 39:33.972
Pull what you got, Heavy.

39:34.005 --> 39:35.874
Bone.

39:35.907 --> 39:37.609
Understand this--
you kill me right now,

39:37.643 --> 39:39.044
you might as well
put that gun

39:39.077 --> 39:40.646
to your own head.

39:48.820 --> 39:50.656
(laughs)

39:50.689 --> 39:53.959
All right, yo,
we can do this another day.

39:53.992 --> 39:55.727
But this ain't over,

39:55.761 --> 39:58.096
not by a long shot.

39:58.129 --> 39:59.431
Remember this,

39:59.465 --> 40:00.899
'cause you're
gonna see it again

40:00.932 --> 40:02.734
real soon.

40:02.768 --> 40:04.703
I look forward to that.

40:08.239 --> 40:09.808
(short siren blast)

40:09.841 --> 40:12.544
(police radio chatter)

40:12.578 --> 40:14.813
AGENT:Let me see your hands!
Put 'em where I can see 'em.

40:14.846 --> 40:17.916
(chuckling)

40:17.949 --> 40:19.618
DAVID:
Might even be taking

40:19.651 --> 40:22.420
a picture of that face
a little sooner than you think.

40:25.991 --> 40:28.794
You okay?

40:28.827 --> 40:30.095
Yeah, I'm all right.

40:30.128 --> 40:32.664
* On the walls of the day

40:32.698 --> 40:36.067
* In the shade of the sun,
we wrote down... *

40:36.101 --> 40:38.604
DON: I mean, I can't say the
weekend worked out

40:38.637 --> 40:40.071
exactly as I hoped, but...

40:40.105 --> 40:42.040
I admit I had a
rescue fantasy dream,

40:42.073 --> 40:43.909
but this was
a bit much.

40:43.942 --> 40:44.910
Thanks.

40:44.943 --> 40:47.779
Oh, yeah?
Was I in it?

40:47.813 --> 40:49.214
You know, my trial
starts on Monday,

40:49.247 --> 40:52.984
but maybe when things settle,
you can find out.

40:53.018 --> 40:54.986
Hey.

40:55.020 --> 40:58.624
Technically, I mean, the
FBI still owns the room.

41:00.225 --> 41:02.561
We never did finish
that candlelight dinner.

41:02.594 --> 41:05.664
Yeah, it'd be a shame to waste
the government's money, right?

41:05.697 --> 41:07.599
Mm-hmm.

41:10.001 --> 41:11.970
We're just going to be
a little while longer.

41:12.003 --> 41:13.071
Thanks.

41:15.807 --> 41:18.176
Okay, everyone,
watch your step.

41:18.209 --> 41:19.177
ALAN:
Watch my step?

41:19.210 --> 41:20.712
I can't even see my step.

41:20.746 --> 41:21.647
LARRY:
I'm all for adventure,

41:21.680 --> 41:24.082
but the suspense is
starting to kill me.

41:24.115 --> 41:26.985
MEGAN: This from a man who lived
a hundred miles above the Earth?

41:27.018 --> 41:28.620
224 to be exact.

41:28.654 --> 41:30.889
AMITA:
I think it's exciting.

41:32.991 --> 41:34.993
Okay.

41:35.026 --> 41:37.596
Who's first?

41:37.629 --> 41:39.698
(snickers)

41:48.239 --> 41:51.209
Nobody's money to take
this afternoon?

41:51.242 --> 41:53.845
Don't really feel much
like playing.

41:53.879 --> 41:55.080
Yeah.

41:55.113 --> 41:57.783
Sometimes we're blind to the
things that are closest to us.

41:57.816 --> 42:00.819
I think you had it right
the first time.

42:00.852 --> 42:02.053
I shut my eyes on purpose.

42:02.087 --> 42:05.891
It's not our mistakes
that define us, Bishop.

42:05.924 --> 42:07.058
It's what we do afterward

42:07.092 --> 42:09.561
that counts the most.

42:10.696 --> 42:13.098
Mind if I give you some advice?

42:13.131 --> 42:16.067
- I have a say in it?
- No.

42:16.101 --> 42:19.204
Way I see it,
you have two options

42:19.237 --> 42:20.205
ahead of you.

42:20.238 --> 42:21.607
Option number one--

42:21.640 --> 42:24.042
you get tough.

42:24.075 --> 42:26.111
Now, you're a smart kid.

42:26.144 --> 42:27.779
Get your own crew,
you make some money.

42:27.813 --> 42:29.214
I guarantee you,
you'll be dead and buried

42:29.247 --> 42:31.216
by the time
you are 20.

42:31.249 --> 42:32.383
What's choice number two?

42:32.417 --> 42:37.055
Start choosing your friends
just a little more wisely.

42:41.893 --> 42:45.263
And you can start
by teaching me...

42:45.296 --> 42:47.866
how to play some chess.

42:50.969 --> 42:55.206
Friends don't take
money from friends.

42:55.240 --> 42:56.207
All right, good.

42:56.241 --> 42:57.308
I'm going to
lose it, anyway.

42:57.342 --> 42:59.377
Okay, you need to start
with the basics.

42:59.410 --> 43:01.046
This is the pawn.

43:01.079 --> 43:02.247
Hopefully you knew that.

43:02.280 --> 43:04.282
All right, it moves up two
spaces in the beginning move...

43:04.315 --> 43:06.217
* "Be safe," you say...
