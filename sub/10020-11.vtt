WEBVTT

00:04.325 --> 00:06.880
ER

00:06.881 --> 00:08.073
Previously on ER...

00:08.074 --> 00:09.456
- Good morning.
- Good morning.

00:09.457 --> 00:13.092
You were involved in a very serious
automobile accident 10 days ago.

00:13.093 --> 00:14.199
Do you understand?

00:14.200 --> 00:16.447
And I think it would be great
if she were to marry me.

00:17.998 --> 00:19.160
- God!
- What?

00:19.161 --> 00:20.061
WHORE

00:20.062 --> 00:22.298
I don't have to defend
my wasted life in medicine.

00:22.299 --> 00:24.447
- Do you have a son?
- Yeah.

00:24.448 --> 00:27.414
When the SPG Attendings
start backing you up next week...

00:27.415 --> 00:29.220
we'll make your job a lot easier.

00:29.421 --> 00:32.746
You're preaching to the choir.
Less work is fine with me.

00:32.747 --> 00:36.015
If you're reinstated,
you'll let the matter drop?

00:36.116 --> 00:37.580
Yes.

00:37.969 --> 00:40.840
"Think Warm Thoughts"

00:42.092 --> 00:44.500
I'll be back by 6.
Have you seen my gloves?

00:44.721 --> 00:47.391
I got an idea.
Why don't we set a date?

00:47.600 --> 00:50.601
I gotta be at the clinic at 9.
Quit joking with me.

00:50.770 --> 00:52.847
- I'm not.
- I'm halfway out the door...

00:53.064 --> 00:56.600
- ... and you wanna talk about that?
- Right. We got a lot of time.

00:56.819 --> 00:58.196
Oh, what are these?

00:59.239 --> 01:01.695
What is up with you? What is that?

01:02.285 --> 01:05.737
- Doug.
- I just wanted to get a quick size.

01:05.957 --> 01:08.412
I'll get you a rock that'll
knock your eye out.

01:08.626 --> 01:11.877
- Doug, I don't need a ring.
- Sure you do, to make it real.

01:12.297 --> 01:16.427
A ring doesn't make it real.
It's real because we say it's real.

01:16.636 --> 01:20.089
- You do wanna marry me, don't you?
- Of course I wanna marry you.

01:20.308 --> 01:22.765
But I did the whole ring
and the setting the date.

01:22.978 --> 01:24.888
Blah-blah-blah.

01:25.106 --> 01:26.304
That's not what I want.

01:26.525 --> 01:28.483
I am so happy right now.

01:29.070 --> 01:33.283
This is so perfect. Why can't we just
be two people who are getting married?

01:34.660 --> 01:36.487
Cheap date.

01:36.705 --> 01:40.834
- Talk about prepared for anything.
- I've been wanting to use these on you.

01:41.002 --> 01:42.034
Hey!

01:42.253 --> 01:44.080
You haven't already?

01:45.090 --> 01:48.211
- I got this, Kerry. Go inside.
- No. I'm fine.

01:48.970 --> 01:51.213
I hope this isn't an omen for my day.

01:51.432 --> 01:56.012
When Anspaugh sees those figures,
he is gonna wanna bury your children.

01:56.188 --> 01:58.977
It's not the first-month figures
I'm worried about.

01:59.192 --> 02:03.690
- Go inside. It's freezing.
- Synergix taking over makes sense.

02:03.864 --> 02:07.567
If you can't convince Don Anspaugh
of that, I'm telling you I can.

02:07.786 --> 02:10.112
We could just disappear.
Go to St. Barth's.

02:10.330 --> 02:12.325
Let them all freeze to death.

02:15.087 --> 02:16.547
Go in the car.

02:17.132 --> 02:18.876
Think hot thoughts.

02:19.927 --> 02:21.386
Okay.

02:23.000 --> 02:29.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:36.282 --> 02:37.445
Yeah?

02:45.085 --> 02:48.918
That is the filthiest thing
I have ever heard.

02:49.090 --> 02:51.926
With the possible exception of this:

02:54.930 --> 02:58.383
Kerry Weaver, you are
a bad, bad girl.

03:02.524 --> 03:04.184
Lizzie, is this your Mustang?

03:04.402 --> 03:06.644
Yes. I'm leasing it.

03:07.113 --> 03:10.151
There's nothing like a good,
American-made muscle car.

03:10.367 --> 03:13.572
If I'd known this was your car,
I'd sniff the tail pipe.

03:13.788 --> 03:14.952
Excuse me?

03:15.707 --> 03:20.122
I thought we were talking about sex.
Is Allison Beaumont ready for the O.R.?

03:20.339 --> 03:22.131
We were talking about sex?

03:22.300 --> 03:24.970
Lizzie, does she know what's
happening this afternoon?

03:25.137 --> 03:28.838
I'll get her consent for the surgery.
Allison's ready for whatever.

03:29.017 --> 03:30.215
Good attitude.

03:30.394 --> 03:33.146
But she's been rather down about
her vocal-cord paralysis.

03:33.356 --> 03:35.978
Remind me and I'll tell her
about collagen injection.

03:36.193 --> 03:39.479
I've told her about medialization
therapy. She'd like us-

03:39.656 --> 03:42.148
My head-and-neck consult
doesn't do that.

03:42.367 --> 03:45.405
But David Kotlowitz is right
across town at Northwestern.

03:45.621 --> 03:49.206
Insurance won't cover it.
Collagen injection is standard.

03:49.418 --> 03:52.336
Couldn't it be worked out?
Medialization is permanent.

03:52.547 --> 03:57.912
I'll explain it to Allison. You stay
focused on the fibular transfer.

04:53.497 --> 04:54.529
Damn it!

04:54.750 --> 04:59.301
- Do something about this crazy cracker!
- Give us all a break, Carlene, please.

04:59.513 --> 05:01.343
I'm in pain, for your information.

05:01.560 --> 05:04.900
You need to put a sign on this thing.
It just took my money.

05:05.112 --> 05:07.523
Will you sit down and be quiet?

05:07.744 --> 05:10.703
- I'm thirsty.
- A water fountain's down the hall.

05:10.877 --> 05:14.799
Forget it. You know, I do want
my 75 cents back, though.

05:18.064 --> 05:20.690
- I put some money in there too.
- Nice try, Carlene.

05:20.905 --> 05:25.076
I've been sitting here for 45 minutes!
Ain't no nurse ask me what's wrong!

05:25.292 --> 05:26.919
- Got any more gum?
- Nicotine gum.

05:27.089 --> 05:28.752
- Quitting?
- Never should've started.

05:28.927 --> 05:30.757
Yeah. You shouldn't have.

05:31.119 --> 05:33.365
- Dr. Swift.
- How are you doing?

05:33.584 --> 05:36.045
- You're the SPG Attending?
- To lighten your load.

05:36.259 --> 05:39.966
I saw you in that documentary.
You got a lot of face time.

05:40.187 --> 05:42.480
Mark, you looked a little haggard.

05:42.653 --> 05:45.363
Are you letting this job
get to you?

05:46.288 --> 05:47.320
Help me!

05:47.499 --> 05:50.079
- Oh, look at that idiot.
- Oh, boy.

05:50.676 --> 05:53.717
- Dr. Greene, help me!
- We need some help in here!

05:53.934 --> 05:55.312
- I'm okay.
- You look it.

05:55.522 --> 05:59.195
- I'm tired of your mouth.
- Just take it easy, all right?

05:59.367 --> 06:04.204
So looking ahead to your third year,
you stand at the crossroads.

06:04.381 --> 06:07.674
You have an opportunity in clerkships
that will be both...

06:07.892 --> 06:11.232
...challenging and inspiring to you.

06:11.568 --> 06:15.955
I hope I did justice presenting what
is rewarding about Emergency Medicine.

06:16.166 --> 06:19.872
Now, with the time we have left,
anybody have any questions?

06:20.093 --> 06:24.598
Don't ask me about the heat. I have
no idea why this room is freezing.

06:25.233 --> 06:28.740
Do people come into the ER with
objects stuck in their rectums?

06:31.292 --> 06:34.168
That's not the kind of info
people are here for.

06:34.342 --> 06:37.349
- I wouldn't mind hearing.
- Come on.

06:38.396 --> 06:41.188
Okay. Yeah, yeah.
Sometimes it happens.

06:43.097 --> 06:45.930
What's the weirdest thing
you ever took out of there?

06:50.767 --> 06:52.309
Bowling trophy.

06:52.935 --> 06:56.516
Now let's move on to something
more substantive. Yeah?

06:56.728 --> 07:00.227
- Did you ever kill anybody?
- Okay. That's substantive.

07:01.439 --> 07:02.980
The answer is yes.

07:04.065 --> 07:07.764
An elderly man.
I was a surgical intern.

07:08.276 --> 07:10.481
And while tapping his chest...

07:10.495 --> 07:14.524
...I accidentally lacerated his liver
and he died in surgery.

07:14.738 --> 07:17.441
You left Surgery for
Emergency Medicine?

07:17.615 --> 07:18.729
How come?

07:19.699 --> 07:21.572
In the Emergency Department...

07:21.784 --> 07:25.861
...you're seeing a lot of different people
and doing a lot of different things.

07:26.077 --> 07:28.910
You're making a difference
right on the spot.

07:29.121 --> 07:32.736
Can you make a career out of that?
Do you see yourself still in ER...

07:32.956 --> 07:37.117
- ... 10, 15 years from now?
- Fifteen years? Fifteen years.

07:38.084 --> 07:41.533
Yeah. Hey, sure. Why not?
Next question.

07:41.751 --> 07:46.292
If we have this impact in a limited
role, why not overall management.

07:46.504 --> 07:49.705
You can take off your tap shoes,
Dr. West.

07:51.049 --> 07:55.258
From when we met, I assumed your
goal was to take over the ER.

07:55.842 --> 08:00.419
I'm surprised only by your timing.
Can I have a moment with Kerry?

08:00.638 --> 08:01.716
Certainly.

08:01.888 --> 08:06.098
It's a part of my nature to move
quickly when something feels right.

08:12.684 --> 08:16.632
I gotta say, Don, I've been just
blown away by these numbers.

08:16.853 --> 08:20.220
- What do they say in the trenches?
- I haven't heard any complaints.

08:20.437 --> 08:22.312
Mark would support them taking over?

08:23.108 --> 08:26.059
- It'd change how you do business.
- We haven't discussed it.

08:27.775 --> 08:30.859
The feelings of the staff
are something I'd need...

08:31.069 --> 08:33.143
...to find out before
telling the board.

08:36.739 --> 08:39.145
I thought it was a Ponzi scheme.

08:39.323 --> 08:43.700
But I've been with SPG a year and
a half, and I'm having a great time.

08:43.909 --> 08:46.613
12 shifts a month, 18 days off.

08:46.827 --> 08:48.820
- No kidding?
- Beats my schedule.

08:48.995 --> 08:51.284
Let's see the other leg.
Regular hours.

08:51.497 --> 08:53.156
And when 6 p. m. comes...

08:53.790 --> 08:57.238
...and that door hits me in the butt,
I live a real life.

08:58.334 --> 09:00.490
- Your knees are fine.
- What about my ankle?

09:00.667 --> 09:02.623
- Want a portable?
- Call Radiology.

09:02.835 --> 09:04.162
No. Hold on a second.

09:08.005 --> 09:09.629
Do me a favor. Walk for me.

09:11.382 --> 09:12.958
Take a few steps.

09:13.550 --> 09:15.956
SPG uses practice guidelines.

09:16.176 --> 09:19.128
And here I've been skating by
on medical judgment.

09:19.344 --> 09:21.798
Know how much money
is wasted on X-rays?

09:22.012 --> 09:24.217
If you're quitting,
detoxify your body.

09:24.430 --> 09:25.840
Colon irrigations.

09:26.013 --> 09:29.678
Hello, Allison.
Your laptop coming in useful?

09:31.768 --> 09:34.517
Looking for love on the Internet.

09:35.019 --> 09:37.769
There's a form of new technology
where I'm way behind.

09:38.021 --> 09:40.261
I could be e-mailing plenty of folk.

09:41.022 --> 09:43.143
Correspondence will always mean...

09:43.357 --> 09:45.846
...lovely stationery and
writing on it by hand.

09:48.691 --> 09:52.356
I'm a blabbermouth.
Two-hour phone calls.

09:53.154 --> 09:55.607
Let me explain
what we' re doing today.

09:55.821 --> 09:58.441
I have a consent form for you to sign.

09:58.656 --> 10:02.355
We' re taking you back to the O. R.
to revise your fibular transfer.

10:03.283 --> 10:04.397
Why-?

10:04.867 --> 10:06.610
Type it out, Allison.

10:09.911 --> 10:12.199
Vocal-cord surgery?

10:12.372 --> 10:16.699
Yes. Dr. Romano would like to talk
to you about various options.

10:16.874 --> 10:19.659
But right now our main concern
is with your leg.

10:21.418 --> 10:24.086
I'll come back again
this afternoon, okay?

10:27.962 --> 10:31.793
I want my voice back, Dr. Corday.

10:33.133 --> 10:35.704
I would have no life
for the next six years.

10:35.925 --> 10:37.502
Surgery demands that commitment.

10:37.719 --> 10:40.552
But not everybody's willing
to make that sacrifice.

10:40.719 --> 10:43.255
- Got some hard thinking to do.
- Yeah.

10:43.471 --> 10:48.130
- You were on the PBS documentary.
- Yes. I am. I was. I'm Dr. Carter.

10:48.348 --> 10:51.348
Laura Brown. It got me thinking
about Emergency Medicine.

10:51.558 --> 10:55.685
- You should come to a session of mine.
- Actually, it's next on my list.

10:55.895 --> 10:57.885
Dr. Benton, great presentation.

10:58.062 --> 11:00.303
- Thanks. Take care.
- Thanks.

11:01.480 --> 11:04.395
- She'll be something.
- So we're both stuck, eh?

11:04.565 --> 11:07.399
Romano shanghaied me.
This is a total waste of time.

11:07.567 --> 11:09.392
You can't tell kids about it.

11:09.609 --> 11:13.438
Most won't know until they're in it,
and then it'll be wrong for them.

11:13.654 --> 11:16.273
I got a bunch of stiffs in
my session this morning.

11:16.488 --> 11:19.238
- They just ask if you killed anybody.
- What do you say?

11:19.448 --> 11:21.071
Just med students.

11:22.408 --> 11:26.698
- Can I ask you something?
- We're a little swamped down here.

11:26.909 --> 11:28.902
- Can you see some patients?
- Absolutely.

11:29.120 --> 11:33.825
The board may consider granting SPG
an overall management contract.

11:34.038 --> 11:36.161
- It's happening pretty fast.
- Think so?

11:36.373 --> 11:39.871
Attending coverage is one thing.
But hopping into bed with them?

11:40.083 --> 11:42.833
- It might make life easier-
- I don't know.

11:43.043 --> 11:46.327
I want to keep decision-making
when it comes to patient care.

11:46.545 --> 11:48.252
You won't have to give that up.

11:48.463 --> 11:52.624
This is about Synergix taking over
functions like billing, collections-

11:52.840 --> 11:55.329
- What's Anspaugh's take on it?
- He's for it.

11:55.550 --> 11:57.421
It's something to think about.

11:57.758 --> 12:00.462
Christmas cookies!
Freshly-baked for everybody.

12:00.677 --> 12:02.171
- No, thanks.
- Homemade?

12:02.386 --> 12:06.963
- I don't want the holidays to be over.
- The best part of winter's finished.

12:07.181 --> 12:09.338
Not if you don't want it to be.

12:09.557 --> 12:12.225
- Isn't he nice? He's so nice.
- These are so good.

12:12.433 --> 12:15.517
I need medical attention.
How long am I supposed to wait?

12:15.727 --> 12:18.298
It's a busy day.
Be patient, all right?

12:18.519 --> 12:21.435
You don't look busy, Miss Chiquita
Banana, eating cookies.

12:21.605 --> 12:24.096
Nobody minds if you're
in here where it's warm!

12:24.315 --> 12:27.646
- But why can't you just be quiet and-?
- I can't understand you.

12:27.858 --> 12:31.106
- Why don't you talk slow? In English?
- Yeah?

12:31.318 --> 12:34.317
Can you believe me walking out
after that thing fell on me?

12:36.237 --> 12:37.317
Look...

12:37.613 --> 12:40.944
...I'm sorry I gave you a hard time
over a lousy 75 cents.

12:41.114 --> 12:42.276
I got over it.

12:43.490 --> 12:46.112
My name's John.
Think I can give you a call sometime?

12:47.618 --> 12:50.570
I gotta tell you up front,
because I believe in that...

12:50.786 --> 12:54.533
...and if it makes a difference,
then so be it:

12:56.747 --> 12:58.206
I spent time in prison.

12:59.333 --> 13:02.830
One mistake,
had nothing to do with violence.

13:03.043 --> 13:05.282
But I got a good job now
moving furniture.

13:05.502 --> 13:09.119
And I think me and you
could have some fun together.

13:09.963 --> 13:11.622
- Prison, huh?
- Yeah.

13:13.090 --> 13:15.710
- I'm Randi.
- Randi.

13:17.426 --> 13:19.749
Your fasting blood glucose is 110.
Excellent.

13:19.968 --> 13:22.884
- You're watching your diet?
- And exercising too.

13:23.094 --> 13:26.592
I wish everybody was that good
about controlling their diabetes.

13:27.846 --> 13:31.796
That's just Mikey.
Don't be scared of him.

13:31.975 --> 13:34.974
He likes it in there. It's warm.

13:35.184 --> 13:37.639
Okay. Bye-bye, Mr. Roussakoff.

13:43.813 --> 13:45.307
Mom, what are you doing here?

13:45.481 --> 13:47.935
- Doug came to see me this morning.
- What?

13:48.150 --> 13:51.019
- To ask for your hand in marriage.
- What?

13:51.235 --> 13:55.016
He said he wanted my permission.
He was very polite.

13:55.237 --> 13:57.939
- Tell me this is a joke!
- It's not a joke, Ma.

13:58.154 --> 14:00.442
- How long have you been with him?
- Eight months.

14:00.657 --> 14:03.323
- Did you plan to tell me?
- When the time was right.

14:03.491 --> 14:06.941
- So you intend to marry him?
- At some point, yes.

14:07.160 --> 14:09.944
See, even you know
this will never happen.

14:10.161 --> 14:12.733
We'll talk about it later.
I gotta get back to work.

14:12.954 --> 14:15.823
I took care of you the last time
he broke your heart!

14:15.998 --> 14:19.494
- He's not gonna break my heart.
- Men like him don't change!

14:19.708 --> 14:24.284
- What did you say to him?
- I told him nothing. I came to see you.

14:24.501 --> 14:25.829
Do you know where Mark is?

14:26.043 --> 14:29.329
Yeah, he's right here.
I've been talking to him about SPG-

14:29.504 --> 14:31.295
This concerns another matter.

14:31.505 --> 14:34.872
Not a good idea to put
the space heater in the bed with you.

14:35.091 --> 14:39.632
- Dr. Greene, may I have a moment?
- Yeah. Sure. Excuse me.

14:39.843 --> 14:40.874
What's up?

14:41.094 --> 14:45.089
Mark, I haven't wanted it too
widely known around the hospital...

14:45.304 --> 14:48.920
My son Scott was treated
for B-cell lymphoma 10 months ago.

14:49.140 --> 14:51.011
- Oh, no. I'm sorry.
- No.

14:51.223 --> 14:54.637
He's fine. The chemo was successful.
But I just...

14:54.850 --> 14:59.511
...got a phone call from his school.
He's complaining of abdominal pain.

14:59.729 --> 15:02.017
I told them to send him here
by taxicab.

15:02.229 --> 15:03.510
It's better to be safe.

15:04.272 --> 15:06.809
He didn't get along with
his previous doctor.

15:07.316 --> 15:11.311
I'd like you to look after his
care personally when he arrives.

15:11.526 --> 15:14.015
I'm sorry to hear he's sick.
How old is Scott?

15:14.235 --> 15:17.270
He's almost 13.
He's handled it all quite well.

15:17.487 --> 15:19.812
- I'll stay out of your way.
- Don't worry.

15:19.988 --> 15:22.195
- Page me when he arrives.
- Mark.

15:23.324 --> 15:24.486
Can you-?

15:25.450 --> 15:28.733
- Was he talking to you about SPG?
- No. His son is coming in.

15:28.952 --> 15:31.986
- Really?
- I didn't know they had any kids.

15:32.204 --> 15:36.412
He has a daughter too. I can clear
Curtain 3. Do they need a Trauma room?

15:36.621 --> 15:38.828
I think he just wants me to see him.

15:40.041 --> 15:43.076
Right. Of course.
Let me know if I can help.

15:43.292 --> 15:45.629
Sure.

15:51.257 --> 15:54.211
- Jeanie, can you hang with me?
- Yeah, what's up?

15:54.427 --> 15:57.000
Anspaugh's son is coming in
with abdominal pain.

15:57.221 --> 15:59.428
I doubt he'd want me
anywhere near his son.

15:59.640 --> 16:02.595
The boy was treated last year
for B-cell lymphoma.

16:02.770 --> 16:06.388
So he's probably not too happy
to come here. There he is.

16:06.606 --> 16:08.350
Just another friendly face.

16:10.319 --> 16:14.234
Hey, Scott? Hi, I'm Dr. Greene.
How are you feeling?

16:14.407 --> 16:16.779
- Just have an upset stomach.
- Yeah?

16:16.993 --> 16:19.780
Why don't you let us check you out.
This is Jeanie Boulet.

16:19.995 --> 16:21.869
- Hey.
- There's nothing wrong with me.

16:22.081 --> 16:25.368
Well, we just wanna be
absolutely sure. Okay?

16:25.586 --> 16:27.246
So listen, it's no big deal.

16:27.420 --> 16:28.832
Tell my dad it's no big deal.

16:29.046 --> 16:32.214
The whole school was looking at me
when I got in this damn cab.

16:32.426 --> 16:35.262
Listen, Scott, we're freezing
our butts off out here.

16:35.470 --> 16:38.887
Why don't you just come in
and just talk to your dad, okay?

16:39.099 --> 16:41.769
I can walk.
I don't need that wheelchair.

16:41.935 --> 16:42.967
All right.

16:43.561 --> 16:47.562
Doug, pick up. It's me. Hello?

16:47.985 --> 16:50.689
I don't know where you are.
But when you get this...

16:50.903 --> 16:54.949
...you call me right away.
You can run, but you cannot hide.

16:56.160 --> 16:58.733
- This last room on the left.
- You doing okay?

16:58.911 --> 17:01.949
- I just have a stomachache.
- All right.

17:02.165 --> 17:05.332
Scott. Scott, I'm here, son.
Where's the wheelchair?

17:05.544 --> 17:09.625
- He wanted to walk, which is fine.
- Dr. Greene's one of our best doctors.

17:09.840 --> 17:11.750
He's gonna take good care of you.

17:11.925 --> 17:14.797
Why can't I have
a stomachache sometimes?

17:15.096 --> 17:16.971
- Have you been vomiting?
- Just once.

17:17.182 --> 17:19.755
Crappy seafood restaurant
last night, Dad.

17:20.185 --> 17:22.057
That's why I'm sick.

17:22.270 --> 17:24.844
- Gone to the bathroom?
- My bowel's not obstructed.

17:25.065 --> 17:27.769
- Been able to pass gas?
- Yes, I said.

17:27.942 --> 17:30.018
Let me feel your belly.

17:32.030 --> 17:36.277
Tender? Okay, let's get a CBC,
Chem-20 and abdominal series.

17:36.452 --> 17:38.195
No, damn it! No needles!

17:38.411 --> 17:42.362
You better not even try to stick
me with another needle! Hear me?

17:42.542 --> 17:44.829
All right. All right.

17:45.586 --> 17:47.045
No needles.

17:48.130 --> 17:49.541
Not right now.

17:52.927 --> 17:57.057
I'm trying to locate Dr. Kotlowitz.
I'm Dr. Corday from County General.

17:57.224 --> 17:58.386
- Dr. Corday?
- Yes.

17:58.559 --> 18:01.429
I just wrote you a note.
I'm sorry you came all this way.

18:01.646 --> 18:03.970
I'm going on a consult.
David Kotlowitz.

18:04.147 --> 18:05.393
Elizabeth Corday.

18:05.607 --> 18:08.525
If I can have a minute,
I'd like to persuade you.

18:08.735 --> 18:11.821
- I'll give you two. Walk with me.
- That's terrific.

18:14.784 --> 18:18.070
My heart goes out to Miss Beaumont.
It was a devastating accident.

18:18.289 --> 18:20.364
Allison's quite lucky to be alive.

18:20.582 --> 18:21.992
She has extraordinary spirit.

18:22.167 --> 18:25.536
Which is why I asked you simply
to see her. Examine her.

18:25.754 --> 18:28.244
And agree to do a free
medialization thyroplasty.

18:28.465 --> 18:31.835
Well, her insurance won't cover it,
apparently. So...

18:32.010 --> 18:36.638
- ... yes, that is what I'm asking.
- And why would I do that?

18:36.849 --> 18:39.340
If you meet Allison,
you'll want to do it.

18:41.271 --> 18:46.098
Well, I'm headed to your part of town,
but I don't have privileges at County.

18:46.316 --> 18:50.482
But any bureaucratic matters, I'm sure
Dr. Romano can help straighten out.

18:50.696 --> 18:52.688
You're speaking on Romano's behalf?

18:52.865 --> 18:55.867
No. I'm speaking on
Allison Beaumont's behalf.

18:57.203 --> 19:00.822
It's not frostbite, but we
should put it in some warm water.

19:04.880 --> 19:07.452
- What is that?
- It sounds like a Tamagotchi.

19:07.673 --> 19:08.751
A what?

19:11.219 --> 19:13.970
Some kid must've dropped it.

19:14.180 --> 19:15.971
A white one! I collect them.

19:16.140 --> 19:19.094
- What is it?
- It's a pretend pet you take care of.

19:19.269 --> 19:20.301
What?

19:20.478 --> 19:24.643
It's probably hungry. Whoever left
it behind must not care too much.

19:24.858 --> 19:26.103
Can I have it?

19:26.401 --> 19:28.560
No, I gotta take it
to lost and found.

19:28.779 --> 19:30.937
When the kid gets back,
it'll be dead.

19:31.156 --> 19:32.532
What do you mean, dead?

19:32.742 --> 19:35.695
- I'll give you 20 bucks for it.
- No!

19:36.077 --> 19:37.952
Can you tell
what's wrong with it?

19:38.163 --> 19:40.122
I just saw a report on TV.
I don't know.

19:40.333 --> 19:41.613
30 bucks.

19:41.836 --> 19:45.002
If someone comes by looking,
just say you never saw it.

19:45.213 --> 19:46.589
40 bucks.

19:48.759 --> 19:50.336
- Scott.
- What?

19:50.844 --> 19:52.884
I understand you not
wanting to be stuck.

19:53.096 --> 19:56.264
I made a $10 bet with your dad
that I could stick you...

19:56.433 --> 19:57.844
...and you'd never feel it.

19:58.060 --> 20:02.010
- So?
- So I'll cut you in on the deal.

20:02.231 --> 20:04.852
You let me draw some blood,
and you got it.

20:05.067 --> 20:07.226
Stop talking to me like I'm a kid.

20:07.445 --> 20:11.775
I've had so much chemo that my veins
have been sclerosed.

20:12.075 --> 20:14.198
So you just get the hell out of here.

20:15.161 --> 20:18.032
We gotta find out what's causing
your stomachaches.

20:18.248 --> 20:19.907
If you don't want it easy...

20:20.125 --> 20:22.794
...they'll hold you down
while you yell and scream.

20:23.002 --> 20:24.996
And they'll draw it the hard way.

20:25.422 --> 20:28.459
Sit down, turn your head.
I promise you won't feel it.

20:29.468 --> 20:30.713
How about I stick you?

20:37.351 --> 20:38.929
The smell.

20:39.186 --> 20:40.301
It makes me sick.

20:48.072 --> 20:49.186
It's in.

20:51.533 --> 20:52.696
How'd you do that?

20:52.909 --> 20:55.484
Because I'm the best. Now you know.

21:00.751 --> 21:02.294
- Hey, Cynthia?
- Yeah.

21:02.504 --> 21:04.791
- You know about these?
- It's a virtual pet.

21:05.006 --> 21:07.412
- Mark got one for his daughter.
- Wait.

21:07.632 --> 21:11.169
Someone left it in Exam 1. Did
anyone call about it or anything?

21:11.388 --> 21:12.930
It won't stop.

21:15.016 --> 21:16.724
I think it pooped.

21:17.185 --> 21:18.679
- What?
- Yeah.

21:19.021 --> 21:20.728
You see that pile there?

21:20.939 --> 21:23.015
- You're supposed to clean it up.
- How?

21:23.233 --> 21:27.397
- I don't know. Want me to call Mark?
- Disgusting. I can figure it out.

21:27.613 --> 21:29.320
- Wait...
- You know what?

21:29.531 --> 21:32.533
I liked toys when we were kids.
My Barbie van was awesome.

21:32.703 --> 21:34.327
Oh, my God! Oh, my God, look!

21:35.162 --> 21:37.950
- It stopped. I'm so happy.
- Yeah.

21:38.165 --> 21:40.788
If someone calls,
it's in lost and found.

21:41.003 --> 21:44.206
Actually, why don't I just
take care of it for a while.

21:47.717 --> 21:48.999
Anne Reilly?

21:50.429 --> 21:52.089
This is Mrs. Reilly.

21:52.305 --> 21:55.142
I'm her Meals on Wheels person.
One of them at least.

21:55.352 --> 21:57.390
- What's your name?
- Susan McFarlan.

21:57.562 --> 22:01.890
Some days she's confused. But today,
she was definitely more out of it.

22:02.107 --> 22:05.642
- She usually has her hair combed.
- She complain of anything specific?

22:05.861 --> 22:09.195
No. But I took a peek inside.
I don't think she's been eating.

22:09.782 --> 22:13.317
There were untouched plates of food.
At least a couple of days' worth.

22:13.744 --> 22:16.497
- Do you think she's had a stroke?
- We'll check her out.

22:17.541 --> 22:21.409
- Hi, I'm Carol Hathaway.
- Hello.

22:21.587 --> 22:24.541
- What's your name?
- Anne Reilly.

22:24.756 --> 22:26.666
You look so pretty today.

22:27.092 --> 22:31.090
Well, thank you. How are you feeling
today, Mrs. Reilly?

22:31.262 --> 22:33.221
- Fine.
- What month is it?

22:33.933 --> 22:35.593
Well, it's August.

22:36.352 --> 22:37.515
Okay.

22:38.063 --> 22:41.017
We'll have to wait before we can
get her a room. Can you stay?

22:41.233 --> 22:44.102
- Sure.
- Mrs. Reilly...

22:44.319 --> 22:46.608
...we'll talk again
soon in a few minutes.

22:48.449 --> 22:50.773
You look just the same.

22:51.117 --> 22:54.237
Oh, just like when you were a baby.

22:55.581 --> 22:56.660
Okay.

22:58.666 --> 23:01.289
Maybe 10 more of those
would make a difference.

23:01.463 --> 23:04.630
I had a hard-enough time
getting this one.

23:05.884 --> 23:08.374
I'm one of those people
that's always early.

23:08.595 --> 23:11.169
What presentations did you hear
besides Benton's?

23:11.389 --> 23:13.761
None. I mean, what? Dermatology?

23:13.976 --> 23:18.020
Can't see myself sitting in an office
all day popping pimples.

23:18.272 --> 23:22.104
No. For me, it's either Surgery
or Emergency Medicine.

23:22.318 --> 23:25.522
Or Internal Medicine because
they have the sickest people.

23:25.739 --> 23:27.281
But I doubt it's for me.

23:27.447 --> 23:31.695
- Think you can sell me on the ER?
- I haven't been selling well so far.

23:31.911 --> 23:34.200
Never boring, is it?
There's always something?

23:34.413 --> 23:38.245
No, sometimes it's slow, but you're
usually thankful for the break.

23:39.293 --> 23:40.539
I can't wait.

23:42.463 --> 23:46.462
Jeanie's gonna wait up in Radiology
with Dr. Anspaugh's son, okay?

23:46.677 --> 23:49.382
- She should stay with him.
- Did you lose something?

23:49.597 --> 23:51.922
I thought I brought
an extra pack of gum.

23:52.808 --> 23:56.391
Going through them pretty quickly.
I brought you an extra pack.

23:56.604 --> 23:57.884
In here somewhere...

23:58.815 --> 24:00.308
...in the Bermuda Triangle.

24:00.524 --> 24:02.315
It's not like I need it.

24:02.526 --> 24:04.899
The nicotine. It's just...

24:05.113 --> 24:08.862
Do you think Dr. Anspaugh's son will
be okay? He's had cancer once.

24:09.075 --> 24:12.077
We have to worry about recurrence.

24:12.287 --> 24:16.748
I never saw him as much of a family
man. His wife was only 42.

24:17.625 --> 24:18.789
What are you doing?

24:19.086 --> 24:23.712
- There's just a few pills missing...
- Yeah?

24:23.924 --> 24:26.760
Well, I mean, shouldn't
there be some more?

24:26.969 --> 24:30.255
My pills are in your bathroom
in your bag. This is an old pack.

24:30.472 --> 24:32.430
Oh, okay. Okay.

24:32.641 --> 24:36.770
- What are you thinking?
- I don't know. I mean, you know.

24:36.979 --> 24:40.348
- I don't wanna get pregnant.
- I know. We wanna be careful.

24:40.526 --> 24:43.098
Yeah. Oh, bingo.

24:43.319 --> 24:45.111
You are great. Thanks.

24:46.948 --> 24:48.943
You're so grown-up now.

24:49.160 --> 24:52.280
She's tachy at 108.
BP's low, 90/70.

24:52.497 --> 24:54.453
- There's skin tenting.
- Tenting?

24:54.665 --> 24:57.915
She's dehydrated. When I pinch
her skin, it stays pinched.

24:58.128 --> 25:01.828
Let's get her a gown. Start an IV
and send off for a CBC, Chem-20.

25:02.047 --> 25:05.049
- You want to cath her urine?
- Yeah. And get a chest film.

25:05.260 --> 25:08.795
We're gonna change you into a gown
so we can do some more tests.

25:09.389 --> 25:12.059
- Does she have any family?
- She mentioned a daughter.

25:12.225 --> 25:14.799
- I don't know where she is.
- Carol, Doug on two.

25:15.021 --> 25:16.680
I'll get this.

25:16.897 --> 25:18.011
Okay.

25:22.027 --> 25:23.652
Doug?

25:23.863 --> 25:26.437
Guess who stopped by. My mom.

25:29.494 --> 25:31.321
What are you on? Drugs?

25:31.829 --> 25:35.081
No. I just would've liked
to have told her myself.

25:36.292 --> 25:38.332
How do you think she's reacting?

25:40.840 --> 25:43.081
Doug, I gotta go.
I'll call you back.

25:43.680 --> 25:45.077
WHORE

25:45.720 --> 25:49.764
I'll take it from here. Could you escort
Susan to Chairs and please find Mark?

25:49.932 --> 25:51.011
Okay.

25:52.266 --> 25:54.593
Can you stay a little while longer?

25:54.771 --> 25:57.262
Yeah, I don't have any classes
today anyway.

25:57.482 --> 25:58.762
Great.

26:01.903 --> 26:03.399
Mrs. Reilly...

26:05.281 --> 26:08.207
...did someone hurt you?

26:10.394 --> 26:12.433
- Detective Weller.
- Dr. Greene.

26:12.605 --> 26:14.264
- This is Carol Hathaway.
- Hi.

26:14.482 --> 26:18.100
I'm waiting for Detective Muncie.
But I'd like to talk to the victim.

26:18.318 --> 26:20.193
- What's her name?
- Anne Reilly.

26:20.404 --> 26:22.397
- In here.
- Her mental status is altered.

26:22.615 --> 26:24.737
She's not responding to questions.

26:24.949 --> 26:28.615
- Could that be from the trauma?
- Maybe, or she could have Alzheimer's.

26:28.828 --> 26:32.777
She's also dehydrated. We need to
fluid-resuscitate her first.

26:32.998 --> 26:34.871
And also still do a rape kit.

26:35.084 --> 26:36.626
Were her hands bound?

26:36.836 --> 26:40.620
There is some bruising, but no signs
of duct tape like the other one.

26:40.798 --> 26:44.463
She also had a lower-left-rib fracture
and multiple contusions.

26:44.635 --> 26:48.003
One to the back of her head.
You're assuming it's the same rapist.

26:48.222 --> 26:49.930
I don't want two like this.

26:50.141 --> 26:52.465
So you're making some
public announcements?

26:52.684 --> 26:54.142
It's a departmental decision.

26:54.519 --> 26:57.889
- You guys gotta stop this person.
- That's what we intend to do.

26:58.106 --> 26:59.979
I'll start with the girl.

27:00.190 --> 27:04.058
She's very fond of Mrs. Reilly.
She doesn't know about the rape yet.

27:04.279 --> 27:06.984
- All right. Thanks.
- I'll show you.

27:08.575 --> 27:09.772
- Carol?
- Yeah.

27:09.950 --> 27:13.651
Yosh told me he moved Mrs. Reilly
so he could see clinic patients.

27:13.829 --> 27:18.040
- He can't handle them all by himself.
- Dr. Ross came in. He's helping him.

27:18.333 --> 27:20.659
I think he thinks you're mad at him.

27:23.004 --> 27:25.675
- Is this the abdominal series?
- This is Scott Anspaugh.

27:25.882 --> 27:27.424
- Any relation?
- I'm his son.

27:28.010 --> 27:30.501
We'll take some pictures
of your belly.

27:30.720 --> 27:32.179
KUB or upright first?

27:34.806 --> 27:36.183
We'll start with the KUB.

27:43.857 --> 27:45.851
- The tumor's back.
- What'd you say?

27:46.027 --> 27:47.770
I don't need X-rays to know.

27:50.614 --> 27:51.777
Don't move.

27:56.161 --> 28:01.072
If it's bad news, you can worry about
it then. Think about something else.

28:01.540 --> 28:04.992
Like what? Rainbows and dandelions?

28:05.210 --> 28:07.916
What do you like?
What's your favorite thing?

28:08.131 --> 28:09.293
John Woo movies.

28:09.507 --> 28:12.045
His Hollywood movies or
the Hong Kong stuff?

28:12.384 --> 28:15.800
- What do you know about John Woo?
- How much time do you have?

28:18.848 --> 28:20.888
Hey, you're still around?

28:21.393 --> 28:24.179
I sat in on a Pedes introduction
for the heck of it.

28:24.395 --> 28:26.435
Pedes. Very rewarding field.

28:26.648 --> 28:29.603
I wanted to talk to you before
you left about a favor.

28:29.818 --> 28:31.562
- Sure.
- When you're on duty...

28:31.777 --> 28:35.858
- ... can I come by and hang out?
- My words didn't determine your career?

28:36.074 --> 28:37.901
You're good. You're not that good.

28:38.117 --> 28:40.358
- I have a shift tonight.
- That'd be great.

28:40.578 --> 28:44.243
If you'd like, I was thinking
we could get some dinner first.

28:44.415 --> 28:45.695
- Yeah. I'd like.
- Yeah?

28:45.916 --> 28:48.073
But on one condition: I buy.

28:48.293 --> 28:50.619
The ER is your treat.
Dinner will be mine.

28:50.838 --> 28:53.411
- Do you like Thai food?
- Yes, I do.

28:55.133 --> 28:57.623
- How'd it go?
- Well, I didn't sugarcoat it.

28:57.844 --> 29:01.972
I didn't expect you to. Weed out
the losers early. Thanks, Pete.

29:02.224 --> 29:03.598
Dr. Romano.

29:04.015 --> 29:06.092
It's "Peter. " You called me "Pete. "

29:06.436 --> 29:09.104
- Nobody's ever called you Pete?
- No.

29:09.313 --> 29:11.352
"Pete Benton. " It sounds so natural.

29:11.564 --> 29:14.103
Peter. Just Peter.

29:14.694 --> 29:15.856
Petey?

29:16.987 --> 29:18.066
Peter.

29:21.616 --> 29:23.905
- Kotlowitz!
- Dr. Romano, perfect timing.

29:24.118 --> 29:26.241
- Robert Romano!
- What are you doing here?

29:26.412 --> 29:27.444
You know each other?

29:27.621 --> 29:28.998
You've got quite a protégé.

29:29.207 --> 29:32.906
She's convinced me to waive my fee
and perform a Silastic medialization.

29:33.127 --> 29:34.918
It still needs to be ironed out.

29:35.130 --> 29:38.296
- You wanna operate on my patient?
- She's ideal, yeah.

29:38.508 --> 29:40.417
Unless there's a problem with that.

29:42.302 --> 29:44.972
It'll be a chance for us
to put our heads together.

29:45.139 --> 29:47.463
You'll be in touch with me, right?

29:47.641 --> 29:51.508
- Oh, let me walk you out.
- If you have a moment, stay with me.

29:51.729 --> 29:54.598
- Rocket, good to see you.
- Take care.

29:57.150 --> 29:58.479
What's the matter?

30:01.780 --> 30:03.736
Shut the door.

30:07.201 --> 30:09.609
What did I say about that procedure?

30:09.829 --> 30:12.284
- If the fee's the barrier-
- It's not the only one!

30:12.497 --> 30:15.452
Kotlowitz can't operate here.
And we are sure as hell...

30:15.667 --> 30:20.329
...not going to move her for vocal-
cord surgery with her leg as it is.

30:20.547 --> 30:24.924
Anspaugh's granting him privileges.
He's a great fan of Dr. Kotlowitz.

30:25.134 --> 30:29.050
So now you're planning my patient's
treatment with the Chief of Staff.

30:29.263 --> 30:32.348
He was in the hall.
This is great news for Allison.

30:32.558 --> 30:35.309
I will decide what is
in her best interest.

30:35.520 --> 30:39.433
- This is in her best interest.
- It's an unnecessary trip to the O.R.!

30:40.024 --> 30:41.767
No. It's not.

30:41.985 --> 30:46.445
I don't know what's between you and
Dr. Kotlowitz. I couldn't give a-

30:46.656 --> 30:50.984
Allison wants her voice back. And it's
incumbent upon us to bring that about.

30:56.830 --> 31:00.663
Are you questioning my commitment
to this patient's best interests?

31:02.002 --> 31:03.497
- No.
- Good.

31:04.005 --> 31:07.954
Because that is not something
you wanna be doing, Lizzie.

31:13.681 --> 31:18.057
Okay. This time, just make sure that
he takes all of the antibiotics.

31:18.268 --> 31:20.841
All of the medicine until it's gone.
Okay?

31:21.061 --> 31:23.221
All the medicine until it's gone.

31:23.398 --> 31:25.439
Even if he's feeling better.

31:26.067 --> 31:28.059
Okay. Hi.

31:28.361 --> 31:29.393
I'm Dr. Ross.

31:29.571 --> 31:32.571
- I'm Sherry.
- Hi, Sherry. Now...

31:32.824 --> 31:36.407
You've been here before. Are you
still going to the prenatal clinic?

31:36.619 --> 31:39.738
- Yes. I'm going to have a baby.
- What can I do for you?

31:39.914 --> 31:43.245
They cut my food stamps.
It was 65 dollars.

31:43.458 --> 31:47.753
Now it's 49.
49 is 16 less than 65.

31:47.922 --> 31:50.543
- Yes, it is.
- So, what do I stop buying?

31:52.426 --> 31:53.457
Let's...

31:53.677 --> 31:58.219
"Milk is $1.79. Eggs, $1.69.
Peanut butter, the cheapest one... "

31:58.430 --> 31:59.629
Who wrote this for you?

31:59.849 --> 32:02.387
Nurse Hathaway helped me
make my food chart.

32:03.185 --> 32:05.723
Did they say why they
cut your food stamps?

32:06.939 --> 32:10.936
Okay. Well, Sherry, there
are a lot of agencies that can-

32:11.152 --> 32:13.228
That can help you out. I'm gonna...

32:14.155 --> 32:15.434
I'm gonna get...

32:15.614 --> 32:17.440
...some numbers. I'll call them.

32:18.116 --> 32:19.610
I'll be right back.

32:20.743 --> 32:25.654
Three-centimeter laceration to
the vaginal wall at 2 o'clock.

32:28.375 --> 32:32.920
- Am I going to be all right?
- Yes, Mrs. Reilly. Don't worry.

32:33.130 --> 32:35.537
Is the baby going to be okay?

32:36.885 --> 32:38.627
The baby'll be fine.

32:38.928 --> 32:41.881
Contusions to the labia majora
bilaterally.

32:42.097 --> 32:44.802
- Scant purulent discharge.
- Do you want cultures?

32:45.017 --> 32:48.681
- Yeah. GC and chlamydia.
- How about HIV?

32:48.979 --> 32:52.396
Well, we need to find out
who has legal consent.

32:52.608 --> 32:54.896
- Any word on family?
- I haven't heard yet.

32:56.361 --> 32:59.612
I didn't have nearly as hard
a time with you.

32:59.823 --> 33:01.483
I don't think I did.

33:01.658 --> 33:04.741
You're doing very well, Mrs. Reilly.
Won't be much longer.

33:04.952 --> 33:08.286
Let's give her a gram of ceftriaxone
to cover for STDs.

33:08.497 --> 33:09.660
Oh, wait.

33:09.873 --> 33:11.036
Wait.

33:11.790 --> 33:14.284
I'm not going to have a baby, am I?

33:14.504 --> 33:18.334
No. But you are in a hospital and
we'll take very good care of you.

33:18.715 --> 33:20.873
Oh, I know you will, darling.

33:22.720 --> 33:23.751
Mrs. Reilly?

33:25.930 --> 33:27.508
Do you know why you're here?

33:29.809 --> 33:32.643
You remember anyone coming into
your apartment recently?

33:34.021 --> 33:37.308
People don't stop by much anymore,
do they?

33:42.528 --> 33:46.313
Okay, Mrs. Reilly.
You can just relax now, right here.

33:47.826 --> 33:50.495
Let's give her another 500 cc's.

33:50.703 --> 33:53.823
And let the detectives know that
she'll be a little longer.

33:54.040 --> 33:56.614
She's not gonna be any help.
She doesn't remember.

33:56.833 --> 33:58.661
It's probably a blessing.

34:01.507 --> 34:05.040
A woman came in with her daughter
looking for her Tamagotchi.

34:05.217 --> 34:07.210
- I told her that you'd found it.
- Okay.

34:07.428 --> 34:10.795
I had to steal time away all day
to feed it and play with it.

34:12.056 --> 34:13.717
Why does it have wings now?

34:17.521 --> 34:18.719
Oh, my God.

34:19.563 --> 34:23.148
- He's dead.
- Oh, like a little angel!

34:23.360 --> 34:26.360
How can he be dead?
When he bleeped, I took care of him.

34:27.530 --> 34:29.654
I guess they just die sometimes.

34:29.866 --> 34:32.485
But if he was sick,
I would've done something.

34:34.745 --> 34:35.942
You did your best.

34:44.630 --> 34:46.208
I'm sorry. But...

34:59.060 --> 35:00.388
Hello, Jeanie.

35:00.562 --> 35:02.388
Dr. Anspaugh, how are you?

35:03.481 --> 35:04.643
I'm well.

35:05.858 --> 35:07.732
I wanna thank you for your help today.

35:08.403 --> 35:11.403
Well, I can imagine what
Scott's been through.

35:11.614 --> 35:13.902
Can I ask about the abdominal films?

35:14.407 --> 35:17.408
There's a partial obstruction.
We've admitted him.

35:18.662 --> 35:20.534
It could possibly be adhesions...

35:20.746 --> 35:24.745
...from the previous surgery.
We're gonna wait and see.

35:28.213 --> 35:31.463
Scott's faced a lot of adversity
already in life.

35:32.592 --> 35:35.426
But whatever comes,
he can handle it.

35:36.220 --> 35:37.596
I like him.

35:40.140 --> 35:44.392
Well, I just wanted to say thank you.

35:57.238 --> 36:01.866
- We can get a cab over on Michigan.
- Or we can walk off the coconut curry.

36:02.077 --> 36:06.490
- Are you crazy? It's 10 degrees.
- Come on, John. It's three blocks.

36:06.708 --> 36:08.416
- Okay.
- Okay.

36:08.835 --> 36:12.537
I don't want you to think that
I'm cursed with indecision.

36:12.758 --> 36:14.550
I just need to be excited.

36:14.761 --> 36:16.753
- Hey, I understand.
- Are you like that?

36:16.930 --> 36:19.683
Am I like that? Well, you know...

36:20.351 --> 36:22.557
Hey! Hey! Hey!
Wait, wait! Hey!

36:22.729 --> 36:23.761
What's going on?

36:23.939 --> 36:27.143
Wait! Hey! Hey!
Wait, wait, wait!

36:28.443 --> 36:30.687
- I'm a doctor.
- We saw this guy over here.

36:30.864 --> 36:32.324
I don't know if he's dead.

36:32.535 --> 36:34.740
I sent my buddy to get help.

36:37.122 --> 36:39.661
- I'm barely getting a pulse.
- What should we do?

36:39.877 --> 36:42.333
- Go get a cab. I'll stay.
- Come on. Let's go.

36:42.546 --> 36:44.290
- Taxi! Taxi!
- Hurry it up!

36:50.181 --> 36:51.343
Lizzie.

36:51.850 --> 36:53.428
Dr. Romano.

37:00.528 --> 37:03.566
Go ahead and schedule
the Silastic medialization.

37:03.991 --> 37:07.195
- Really?
- I'll work it out with Anspaugh.

37:08.120 --> 37:09.830
- Can I tell Allison?
- Yeah, sure.

37:10.040 --> 37:12.579
I'll do it right now.
It'll lift her spirits.

37:13.962 --> 37:15.041
I...

37:16.675 --> 37:18.882
Personal feelings shouldn't
get in the way.

37:19.054 --> 37:21.461
It was good that
you stayed focused on the patient.

37:21.681 --> 37:23.009
Thanks.

37:24.351 --> 37:29.097
I'm no good at apologizing. Let's let
that be the last thing said about it.

37:29.732 --> 37:32.901
And you and I, we're all right?

37:33.071 --> 37:37.282
Lizzie, you and I are
a match made in heaven.

37:41.040 --> 37:43.497
I got a homeless guy here
with hypothermia.

37:43.710 --> 37:46.249
- Get me warming blankets.
- Heated humidified O-2?

37:46.463 --> 37:49.881
And could you pop a couple of
liters into the microwave too?

37:50.092 --> 37:53.213
- Is the ER always this exciting?
- Pretty much.

37:53.388 --> 37:54.421
Dr. Carter?

37:54.600 --> 37:57.387
This guy was unconscious over
by the medical school.

37:58.311 --> 38:01.231
Be careful. I don't wanna
give him an arrhythmia.

38:01.441 --> 38:03.400
One, two, three.

38:04.279 --> 38:05.359
Good.

38:05.572 --> 38:08.193
- You are?
- I'm Laura Brown.

38:08.492 --> 38:10.201
I'm observing Dr. Carter.

38:10.411 --> 38:14.410
- Second-year med student observing.
- BP's 80 palp. Pulse is 52.

38:14.625 --> 38:17.461
Let's get a core temp,
CBC and a 12-lead.

38:17.671 --> 38:19.794
Let's prep for a pleural lavage.

38:19.965 --> 38:21.960
Come on. Every second counts.

38:22.176 --> 38:25.298
- Pleural lavage?
- Active core rewarming.

38:25.473 --> 38:27.466
It's 10 degrees outside.
He's a Popsicle.

38:27.684 --> 38:31.136
- We still on for dinner?
- Sure. I just wanna finish this up.

38:31.314 --> 38:35.727
- Get an Attending to cover for you.
- I want to see this through.

38:35.945 --> 38:39.029
I'm heading over to Greek Islands.
If you finish, join me.

38:39.240 --> 38:41.116
- Warm saline.
- If it's not too hot...

38:41.327 --> 38:44.495
- ... run in another liter bolus.
- Worried about shock?

38:44.665 --> 38:49.163
No, not if we provide circulatory
support with a cardiopulmonary bypass.

38:49.338 --> 38:50.797
- A bypass in the ER?
- Sure.

38:50.965 --> 38:55.628
It's an excellent way of warming
the blood. Or we could do dialysis.

39:02.188 --> 39:04.263
I wanted to check on her.
I'm leaving.

39:04.482 --> 39:05.977
She was awake a while ago.

39:06.193 --> 39:09.147
She was more coherent, which
means the fluids are working.

39:09.363 --> 39:11.441
But she doesn't know why she's here.

39:11.659 --> 39:16.535
I want to say goodbye to her. It's
inconceivable what the police are saying.

39:16.706 --> 39:20.539
I don't know if I can go back
to that building.

39:21.546 --> 39:23.669
Am I a horrible person?

39:23.882 --> 39:27.299
I consider Mrs. Reilly my friend.
I want to be a friend to her.

39:27.512 --> 39:29.885
You are a good friend.
You brought her here.

39:30.058 --> 39:32.467
But I'm afraid to bring her meals now.

39:32.686 --> 39:36.139
They'll catch this man. You just
go home and get some rest.

39:37.066 --> 39:40.650
- Tell her I'll call her, all right?
- Sure.

39:46.786 --> 39:49.790
Man, it's cold! Did I miss Swift?

39:50.001 --> 39:54.046
- His shift ended 15 minutes ago.
- Oh, shoot.

39:54.255 --> 39:58.089
Are you ready to celebrate?
I got reservations at Rosebud.

39:58.762 --> 40:01.253
Or we can stay in. That's fine.

40:01.432 --> 40:03.057
Sounds better to me.

40:03.268 --> 40:05.178
- Are you tired?
- No.

40:05.394 --> 40:07.767
Anspaugh say something
about the proposal?

40:07.940 --> 40:09.934
His son came in today.

40:10.110 --> 40:14.359
He's got a partial bowel obstruction,
history of B-cell lymphoma.

40:14.574 --> 40:19.369
And Anspaugh went to Mark Greene
to take care of him.

40:19.581 --> 40:24.493
- Well, he knows how busy you are.
- Maybe he's forgotten I'm a doctor.

40:24.754 --> 40:26.878
Sometimes I almost forget.

40:27.425 --> 40:30.627
That's the best reason yet
to let SPG take the load.

40:31.303 --> 40:32.468
Yes.

40:32.764 --> 40:35.173
What'll it be? Your place or mine?

40:36.853 --> 40:39.344
Your place has room service.

40:44.655 --> 40:47.990
Damn it. It presented like
a classic case of hypothermia.

40:48.160 --> 40:51.612
Except for his temperature, which
was three degrees below normal.

40:51.831 --> 40:53.290
What's wrong with him?

40:53.499 --> 40:55.790
Well, he's drunk.

40:56.004 --> 41:00.002
- That's it? There's no bypass?
- No. Not a total wash, though.

41:00.175 --> 41:04.257
Here's how to administer a banana bag.
We give these to all drunks...

41:04.474 --> 41:08.803
...everyone that comes in drunk,
to prevent Wernicke's encephalopathy.

41:09.020 --> 41:13.850
The yellow color is the result of
adding a multivitamin to the fluid.

41:14.068 --> 41:15.479
- No bananas-
- Dr. Benton?

41:15.862 --> 41:19.115
Remember me? I'm Laura Brown.
I was in your lecture today.

41:19.326 --> 41:21.865
- Oh, right.
- I was observing Dr. Carter.

41:22.037 --> 41:24.363
But this looks more interesting.

41:24.540 --> 41:27.542
We're putting a chest tube in
before he goes to surgery.

41:27.753 --> 41:32.297
He has a hemopneumothorax, which
is a bleeding, collapsed lung.

41:32.509 --> 41:35.546
- What kind of animal does that?
- She's feeling better.

41:35.763 --> 41:37.555
I wonder about the human species.

41:37.766 --> 41:40.638
I'd personally volunteer
to castrate this guy.

41:40.855 --> 41:43.346
Make a copy of these
wound-care instructions.

41:43.565 --> 41:46.057
- We're ready to wrap this up.
- You bet.

41:52.869 --> 41:54.826
Thanks for coming in today.

41:55.456 --> 41:56.915
My pleasure.

42:00.253 --> 42:03.340
- It's amazing what you've done here.
- Really?

42:03.551 --> 42:07.419
Well, five shifts a week,
the clinic...

42:07.597 --> 42:09.720
It makes a difference.

42:11.269 --> 42:13.761
I'm sorry I yelled at you
over the phone.

42:13.981 --> 42:16.768
I'm actually glad you spoke
to my mom. It's a relief.

42:16.942 --> 42:19.019
I don't know what I was waiting for.

42:19.863 --> 42:21.655
The other shoe to drop.

42:23.117 --> 42:24.446
Dumb, huh?

42:27.039 --> 42:28.285
You off?

42:28.958 --> 42:32.660
Have to wait on a Psych consult.
Might take a while.

42:33.423 --> 42:34.622
I'll wait.

42:37.720 --> 42:40.127
Finally got an I.D. on our ice man.

42:40.349 --> 42:43.765
He lives in a shelter on Price Street.
They're picking him up.

42:43.978 --> 42:46.648
I thought your student
was gonna stick around.

42:46.815 --> 42:50.399
She went to go watch Benton
operate. I think she got bored.

42:50.612 --> 42:53.483
Well, we're not here
to entertain, Carter.

42:53.699 --> 42:56.191
You know, she seemed so interested.

42:56.412 --> 42:59.531
I was supposed to inspire those
students. But I didn't.

42:59.748 --> 43:03.582
- Inspire them? How?
- Through our passion...

43:04.338 --> 43:05.666
...for what we do.

43:05.839 --> 43:08.332
- Passion?
- Yeah. You know what I mean.

43:09.052 --> 43:10.548
You come here every day.

43:10.763 --> 43:14.014
Sometimes you're really cooking,
and sometimes you're not.

43:14.226 --> 43:16.930
But you're here every day
doing your work.

43:17.479 --> 43:20.102
One day you'll look up...

43:20.317 --> 43:23.105
...and maybe 10 years will have passed.

43:24.197 --> 43:28.861
It'll be the sum total of
what you've done that counts.

43:29.038 --> 43:30.532
Not the passion.

43:32.583 --> 43:34.707
Wanna review some of these charts?

43:36.005 --> 43:37.036
Yeah.

43:43.723 --> 43:46.393
She's an awfully sweet girl,
Susan, isn't she?

43:46.601 --> 43:48.595
She was very worried about you.

43:48.814 --> 43:51.186
She reminds me of my daughter.

43:51.818 --> 43:53.098
I feel so silly.

43:53.319 --> 43:57.864
Such a nuisance, having to bring me
here for a little bump on the head.

44:00.912 --> 44:03.582
- This darn thing's caught.
- Let me help you.

44:03.832 --> 44:06.621
You feel so useless when
you get to be my age.

44:06.836 --> 44:09.708
I've already gotten a bit forgetful.

44:10.047 --> 44:14.512
The other night, I came home and left
my keys hanging in the front door.

44:14.723 --> 44:18.768
I don't think that has anything to
do with age. I do the same thing.

44:20.271 --> 44:22.229
I left my keys in the door.

44:26.779 --> 44:30.114
I left my keys in the door...

44:31.410 --> 44:34.198
...and a man walked
into my apartment.

44:34.415 --> 44:35.447
Mrs. Reilly?

44:35.625 --> 44:39.290
Then he put his hand up over my mouth.

44:39.796 --> 44:44.009
Then he made me get down
on the ground.

44:45.971 --> 44:47.630
Oh, God!

44:48.140 --> 44:50.513
- Mrs. Reilly?
- Oh, my God!

44:51.812 --> 44:55.430
- It's okay. You're gonna be okay now.
- I left the keys...

44:55.650 --> 44:57.691
- ... in the door.
- I know.

44:58.154 --> 44:59.435
I know. It's okay.

44:59.656 --> 45:01.447
Oh, my God!

45:04.663 --> 45:05.944
It's okay.
