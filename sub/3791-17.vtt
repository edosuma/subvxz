02:11.931 --> 02:13.700
TO PREDICT          
A FINE PERFORMANCE.

02:27.280 --> 02:28.615
<i>COME ON, KING MAKER--</i>

HE CAME HOME FOR ME     
AT 10 TO ONE AT BELMONT.

02:34.120 --> 02:35.855

02:35.922 --> 02:38.358
I THOUGHT YOU BOUGHT    
YOUR LINCOLN FROM SELLING   
WEED AT THE HIGH SCHOOL.

02:38.425 --> 02:39.959
- THAT RINGS A BELL.

HAVE TO ATONE FOR               
RATTING DADDY OUT, BABY.

- THERE HE IS, LITTLE       
NICKY RUBENSTEIN.

03:28.842 --> 03:30.477
HE'S ON A PLANE

03:30.543 --> 03:32.045
ON THE HIGHEST OF HOLIDAYS, 
WOULD YOU BELIEVE?          

03:32.112 --> 03:33.780
MA, STOP.       
WE'VE GOT ENOUGH
STRESS TODAY.   

03:33.847 --> 03:36.549
YOUR FATHER'S GOT               
$100 MILLION IN THE BANK.       
HOW MUCH STRESS CAN YOU HAVE?   

03:36.616 --> 03:38.318
WELL, "MEDALLION"'S         
FALLING APART.              

03:38.385 --> 03:40.420
IT'S "MEDELLIN," MOM.           
WHY THE FUCK CAN'T  
ANYONE PRONOUNCE IT?

03:40.453 --> 03:42.155
- DO NOT CURSE          
IN THE TEMPLE.        
- EXCUSE ME.            

03:42.222 --> 03:44.491
BENICIO WALKED              
AND MY FATHER'S TRYING      
TO PREVENT THE WHOLE CREW   

03:44.557 --> 03:46.860
- FROM DOING THE SAME.          
- HE'S BEEN SAYING BENICIO'S    
GONNA WALK FOR WEEKS.         

03:46.926 --> 03:49.295
NO, IT'S OFFICIAL.      
CHECK OUT "US WEEKLY."  
THERE'S A PICTURE OF HIM

03:49.362 --> 03:51.765
ON A CATAMARAN              
WITH SOME BLONDE BOMBSHELL  
IN ANGUILLA.                

03:51.831 --> 03:54.100

- ANTIGUA, ANGUILLA--       
WHO THE FUCK CARES?       

03:54.167 --> 03:56.269

- ALL RIGHT, EXCUSE ME,     
EXCUSE ME.

HAGGIS IS FREAKED, OKAY?

03:58.605 --> 04:00.373
AND GATOFF IS GIVING US 
TILL SUNDOWN TONIGHT    

04:00.440 --> 04:02.308
TO FIND A REPLACEMENT   
OR HE'S GONNA SHUT  
THE WHOLE THING DOWN.   

04:02.375 --> 04:04.611
I HEAR CRUISE IS GOING          
FOR 10Â¢ ON THE DOLLAR.          

04:04.678 --> 04:06.880
NO NO NO NO.            
I WANT YOUR BOY, ARI.   
I WANT VINCE.           

04:06.946 --> 04:09.349
HE'S NOT MY BOY ANYMORE.    
- THEN PUT ME ON THE PHONE  
WITH HIM,                 

04:09.416 --> 04:11.651
'CAUSE THIS GIRL'S      
AGENCY IS CLOSED        
FOR THE FUCKING HOLIDAY.

04:11.718 --> 04:13.887
ARI DOESN'T HAVE A PHONE, NICK. 
IT'S YOM KIPPUR.                

04:13.953 --> 04:16.690
NICK DOESN'T EITHER         
BECAUSE I FRISKED HIM       
BEFORE WE WALKED OUT.       

04:16.755 --> 04:19.325
LOOK, SINCE YOU WON'T   
COMMISSION VINCE ON THIS,   
COMMISSION US, OKAY?    

04:19.426 --> 04:20.860
THE BACK END        
COULD BE HUGE.      

04:20.927 --> 04:22.729
JESUS CHRIST,               
IT IS YOM KIPP.             

04:22.796 --> 04:25.265
AND LOOK WHO JUST               
SAID "JESUS CHRIST."            
YOUR FATHER AGREED TO THIS?     

04:25.331 --> 04:26.933
I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW    
I SPEAK FOR THE FAMILY.

I CAN'T DO IT.                  

04:32.572 --> 04:35.508

COME ON, ERIC, THIS IS ABSURD.  

06:28.488 --> 06:30.790
- WHAT'S SHE SAYING?        
- SHE DOESN'T WANT          
TO GO TO TEMPLE.          

06:30.857 --> 06:33.026
- LET ME TALK TO HER.       
- SHE'LL GO TEMPLE          
FOR VINCE.                

06:33.126 --> 06:35.962
Drama:                      
SHE'D GO TO THE GAZA STRIP  
IN A YARMULKE FOR VINCE.    

06:36.029 --> 06:38.365
YOU REALIZE THAT THIS

BY SUNSET, RIGHT?               

06:38.431 --> 06:41.067
YES, ERIC, I HEARD YOU,

06:43.036 --> 06:45.238
- CAN I TALK TO HER?        
- WHY DID YOU WANT ME       
TO CALL HER?

TO TEMPLE NOW.                  

07:22.409 --> 07:24.911
THAT WAS A SURE THING.          

07:24.978 --> 07:26.880
THIS WILL BE        
THE EASIEST PAYCHECK
YOU EVER MADE,      

07:26.946 --> 07:29.015

OKAY, ARE WE DOING A DEAL   
OR TALKING ABOUT        
GLORY DAYS?

MY FATHER SAID                  
IT WAS THREE.

WOW.  OKAY, AMANDA,

TRUST US, NICK.     

12:18.872 --> 12:21.274
WHICH ONE OF YOU TRIED          
TO FUCK HER ANYWAY?             

12:21.307 --> 12:24.644
BOTH.  BUT IN MY                
FATHER'S DEFENSE, HE WAS        
LEGALLY SEPARATED AT THE TIME.  

12:24.711 --> 12:27.580
- WHAT'S YOUR EXCUSE?           
- I DON'T HAVE ONE.             
I STILL WANT TO FUCK HER.     

12:27.647 --> 12:29.582
- LET'S CALL E.         
- WHY?                  

12:29.649 --> 12:31.584
PUT THE FEAR OF GOD     
INTO THE LITTLE IRISHMAN.   

12:31.651 --> 12:33.586
HE'S MORE OF            
A NEUROTIC JEW          
THAN YOU ARE.           

12:33.653 --> 12:34.954
Drama:              
<i>IT'S OKAY, BRO.</i>        

12:34.988 --> 12:36.956
EVERYTHING'S            
GONNA BE OKAY.          

12:36.990 --> 12:38.491
WINNING             
AIN'T EVERYTHING.       

12:38.558 --> 12:40.627
WOULD HAVE BEEN NICE   
IF YOU AT LEAST         
PLACED, THOUGH.         

12:40.694 --> 12:43.096
WHAT?  I HAD    
A HUNDY ON THAT.

12:43.163 --> 12:45.565
DON'T MAKE HIM              
FEEL WORSE, TURTLE.         

12:45.632 --> 12:48.101
SO IYOU CAN'T               
RACE HIM ANYMORE,           
THEN WHAT?                  

12:48.168 --> 12:50.236
ARE YOU GONNA               
PUT HIM OUT TO STUD?        

12:50.303 --> 12:53.673
NO, HE'S STERILE.               
SO IT'S EITHER THE DUDE RANCH   
OR THE GLUE FACTORY.            

12:53.740 --> 12:57.243
THE GLUE FACTORY?

SHE'S TRYING TO TURN IT 
INTO M:i:III.           

13:38.084 --> 13:39.919
I THINK SHE'S TRYING
TO BLOW THE DEAL.

DOESN'T GET IT IN TIME?     

18:24.838 --> 18:26.539
ERIC, DO YOU            
REALLY BELIEVE          

18:26.606 --> 18:28.608
THAT ARTHUR GATOFF      
IS GONNA SCRAP AN       
$80-MILLION MOVIE       

18:28.675 --> 18:30.343
BASED ON SOME           
RIDICULOUS DEADLINE?        

18:30.410 --> 18:32.946
WELL, THAT'S WHAT       
THE PRODUCER OF THE MOVIE   
SAYS, SO YES, I DO.     

18:33.013 --> 18:36.249
OKAY, ERIC,         
THE PRODUCER AND HIS        
NEW HIGH-POWERED AGENT      

18:36.316 --> 18:39.252
ARE TRYING TO HOLD      
A GUN TO OUR HEADS      
AND YOU'RE FALLING FOR IT.  

18:42.522 --> 18:44.524
<i>He calls this</i>

<i>So, please, just relaxlms.</i>

NOW I WILL CALL YOU

18:58.772 --> 19:00.774
WHAT'D SHE SAY?                 

19:00.840 --> 19:02.676
SHE THINKS THE DEADLINE 
DOESN'T MEAN SHIT.      

19:02.742 --> 19:04.444
WHAT DO YOU THINK?              

19:04.511 --> 19:06.112
I THINK SHE'S BEEN          
ON THIS MOVIE FIVE MINUTES. 

19:06.179 --> 19:07.647
WE'VE BEEN CHASING IT   
TWO YEARS.

- KING!  OH, KING!          

19:20.627 --> 19:22.162
ARE YOU AROUND HERE, KING?  

19:22.262 --> 19:24.197
HE'S A HORSE, DRAMA,
NOT A HOUSECAT.     

19:24.264 --> 19:26.666
- I THINK WE'D SEE HIM          
IF HE WAS AROUND.             
- DON'T EVEN TALK TO ME, TURTLE.

19:26.733 --> 19:28.401

IT DON'T.                       

19:32.072 --> 19:34.207
THAT'S 'CAUSE       
HE'S A HORSE, DRAMA.
HE WEIGHS 3000 LBS. 

19:34.240 --> 19:37.243
- JUST DRIVE THE CAR.       
- ALL RIGHT, RELAX,         
WE'LL FIND HIM.           

19:37.310 --> 19:39.646
WE'D BETTER.                    
'CAUSE IF ANYTHING              
HAPPENS TO HIM,                 

19:39.713 --> 19:41.581
I'LL NEVER                      
FORGIVE MYSELF.

19:53.393 --> 19:56.262
STEP AWAY.          
STEP AWAY FROM THE HORSE.   
HE GETS A LITTLE NERVOUS.   

19:56.329 --> 19:58.331
HOW ARE YOU DOING, BUDDY?   
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?        

19:58.398 --> 20:00.066

I CHASED THIS MOVIE 
FOR TWO YEARS       

24:58.331 --> 25:00.500
HARDER THAN I'VE CHASED 
ANYTHING IN MY LIFE     

25:00.567 --> 25:02.369
AND I WANTED IT SO BADLY.   

25:02.402 --> 25:04.237
I KNOW, VINCE,                  
AND I WANTED IT FOR YOU.        

25:04.304 --> 25:07.073
- IT DOESN'T FEEL THAT WAY.     
- NO?  HOW DOES IT FEEL?        

25:07.173 --> 25:10.210
IT FEELS LIKE YOU STALLED.  
AND I'M JUST WONDERING,     

25:10.243 --> 25:13.146
<i>ARE YOU STALLING AS MY AGENT</i>   
<i>BECAUSE YOU DON'T</i>          
<i>LIKE THE PROJECT</i>           

25:13.213 --> 25:15.648
OR AS MY GIRLFRIEND 

25:15.715 --> 25:18.551
BECAUSE YOU DON'T LIKE  
THE IDEA THAT I'LL BE   
GONE FOR SIX MONTHS?    

25:18.585 --> 25:20.587
ARI CONVINCED YOU               
THAT I STALLED?                 

25:20.653 --> 25:23.623
I LOST A PROJECT.       
WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES    
IT MAKE WHO IT WAS?     

25:23.723 --> 25:25.892
THE DIFFERENCE IS,              
YOU HAVE NEVER LET ARI          

25:25.959 --> 25:28.561
WELL, MAYBE         
I SHOULDN'T HAVE.   

25:28.595 --> 25:31.231
NO, MAYBE YOU               
SHOULDN'T HAVE.             

25:31.297 --> 25:32.866
BUT LET ME JUST             
TELL YOU THIS:              

25:32.932 --> 25:35.235
I DIDN'T LOSE THE MOVIE.        
THE MOVIE WAS LOST              

25:35.301 --> 25:37.537
WHEN NICK RUBENSTEIN BARGED     
INTO ARTHUR GATOFF'S TEMPLE     

25:37.604 --> 25:39.539
FOR THE SECOND TIME             
THIS AFTERNOON                  

25:39.606 --> 25:41.574
<i>LIKE THE SPOILED</i>               
<i>LITTLE BABY HE IS.</i>             

25:41.608 --> 25:43.543
NOW ARTHUR PAYS PEOPLE          
TO MAKE HIS LIFE EASIER,        

25:43.610 --> 25:45.578
BUT TODAY                       
NICK DIDN'T DO THAT.            

25:45.612 --> 25:47.580
INSTEAD, HE AGGRAVATED          
HIM EVEN MORE.                  

25:47.614 --> 25:50.383
AND I KNOW THIS                 
BECAUSE ARTHUR CALLED ME        
RIGHT AFTER SUNDOWN.            

25:50.450 --> 25:54.120
<i>AND YOU KNOW WHAT HE SAID?</i>     
<i>"THIS MOVIE WAS PLAGUED</i>        
<i>SINCE DAY ONE.</i>                 

25:54.187 --> 25:56.923
I'M GONNA CUT MY LOSSES.        
BUT I LOVE VINCE.               

25:56.956 --> 25:59.192
I'D LOVE TO DO JUST ABOUT       
ANYTHING ELSE WITH HIM.         

25:59.259 --> 26:01.795
<i>LET'S SET A LUNCH."</i>            

26:04.130 --> 26:07.467
I FEEL STUPID.  

26:07.534 --> 26:09.936
PROBABLY DOESN'T HAPPEN         
TO YOU A LOT, HUH?              

26:09.969 --> 26:11.905
( chuckles )    

26:14.874 --> 26:17.143
SO WHAT DO WE DO NOW?   

26:18.411 --> 26:21.314
VINCE,                     
WE SAY GOODBYE.             

26:24.451 --> 26:26.753
