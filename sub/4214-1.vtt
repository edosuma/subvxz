01:19.379 --> 01:21.313
<i>Yes.</i>

01:56.716 --> 01:58.650
<i>Yes.</i>

02:21.274 --> 02:23.208
<i>Yes.</i>

02:44.330 --> 02:46.298
<i>Please. Please.
Don't worry. Don't worry.</i>

02:46.366 --> 02:49.164
It's utter chaos
around here.

02:49.235 --> 02:51.863
And I'm terrified that
we're running out of time.

02:51.938 --> 02:53.872
Am I trying to be
too perfect?

02:53.940 --> 02:56.204
Oh, but I want it to be
so exquisite. So do we.

02:56.276 --> 03:00.770
But we're trying to be too
exquisite. Why not aim for the stars?

03:00.847 --> 03:02.781
Good morning.
Good morning.

03:02.849 --> 03:06.216
We do need some answers on the
flowers. Ah, yes, freesia, freesia.

03:06.286 --> 03:09.312
Everywhere freesia.
Daddy loves freesia.

03:09.389 --> 03:12.483
Good morning. Good morning.
Oh. Hello. Hi.

03:12.559 --> 03:14.493
<i>Lights?
"Lights."</i>

03:14.561 --> 03:18.588
Not too bright
and not too dark.

03:18.665 --> 03:21.566
I'm looking for
a saffron glow,

03:21.634 --> 03:23.898
sort of tea-dance '20s.

03:23.970 --> 03:26.131
If food is the prose
of a party,

03:26.206 --> 03:29.437
then lights
are its poetry.

03:32.979 --> 03:36.039
It works. If food is the prose
of a party, lights are its poetry.

03:36.115 --> 03:40.484
I like that. If music were the food of
love, play on. I'm going out of my mind.

03:40.553 --> 03:42.487
Good morning,
Mr. Parrish.

03:42.555 --> 03:45.251
What do you think of all this,
Helen? It's gonna be beautiful.

03:45.325 --> 03:47.759
And Allison says
the president may come.

03:47.827 --> 03:51.524
<i>The president's got better things to do
than come to my birthday party. Like what?</i>

03:51.598 --> 03:53.759
Daddy? Do you have a minute?
Good morning, Allison.

03:53.833 --> 03:56.028
Not much more.
Big day in the big city.

03:56.102 --> 03:58.536
What's on your mind? Fireworks. Update:

03:58.605 --> 04:01.438
We are constructing the
number 65 on the barge. Mm-hmm.

04:01.507 --> 04:05.375
Archers from the State College of New
Paltz will shoot flaming arrows at it.

04:05.445 --> 04:09.882
When it catches fire, it will give
us the effect of a Viking funeral,

04:09.949 --> 04:11.883
but with none
of the morbidity.

04:11.951 --> 04:15.045
The Hudson River Authority says that for
you, they'll make a special dispensation.

04:15.121 --> 04:17.954
But, of course, there
will be an overtime bill...

04:18.024 --> 04:19.958
for the Poughkeepsie
Fire Department.

04:20.026 --> 04:23.393
So, what
do you think?

04:23.463 --> 04:25.863
Good?
No good?

04:25.932 --> 04:29.129
Allison, I trust you.
This is your thing.

04:29.202 --> 04:33.161
But it's your birthday. I hate
arrows. They make me nervous.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.674
Good morning, Dad.
Good morning, honey.

04:36.743 --> 04:39.109
Morning. Morning. You're
"Honey." I'm "Allison."

04:39.178 --> 04:41.373
Oh.

04:41.447 --> 04:45.747
Oh, Dad, Drew called from the helicopter,
and they're still two minutes away.

04:45.818 --> 04:47.979
Drew's aboard?
Mm-hmm.

04:48.054 --> 04:50.045
He wanted to ride
back down with you.

04:50.123 --> 04:54.253
So why don't you sit down, relax, and
get some food in that flat tummy of yours.

04:54.327 --> 04:56.261
Are you coming?
No.

04:56.329 --> 04:59.560
You've got patients to attend to.
I've got three hysterical chefs,

04:59.632 --> 05:01.691
one of whom loves truffles,
the other one hates truffles,

05:01.768 --> 05:04.168
and the third one doesn't
even know what truffles are.

05:04.237 --> 05:06.933
I hate parties. But, Daddy, calm down.

05:07.006 --> 05:09.236
You're gonna love it.
I swear.

05:09.309 --> 05:12.574
Isn't it enough to be on the Earth for 65
years without having to be reminded of it?

05:12.645 --> 05:15.910
No.

05:18.017 --> 05:21.248
Will you relax?
I know it's a big deal day.

05:21.321 --> 05:24.654
How'd you know that?
Drew told me.

05:24.724 --> 05:26.658
Does he tell you
everything?

05:26.726 --> 05:29.286
I hope so.

05:29.362 --> 05:31.694
You like him,
don't you?

05:31.764 --> 05:34.528
Yep,
I guess so.

05:34.600 --> 05:37.125
I don't want to interfere,
but, uh... Then don't.

05:39.605 --> 05:42.130
<i>Well, here comes
our boy now.</i>

05:42.208 --> 05:44.142
Shall we?

05:45.445 --> 05:47.879
- Okay.
- Hello, beautiful.

05:49.048 --> 05:50.982
Hi.

05:55.388 --> 05:58.084
Good morning, Drew.
Thanks for coming up.

05:58.157 --> 06:01.888
Well, big day. Wanted to line
up a few ducks before kickoff.

06:01.961 --> 06:04.794
Any thoughts, last minute
refinements, variations, anything?

06:04.864 --> 06:09.096
Thoughts, no. I did
hear a voice last night.

06:09.168 --> 06:11.261
A voice?
In my sleep.

06:11.337 --> 06:13.805
What'd it say?
"Yes."

06:13.873 --> 06:17.639
Yes to the deal?
Maybe. Who knows?

06:17.710 --> 06:19.644
You know how voices are.

06:19.712 --> 06:22.943
Hmm?
I thank you, Delia.

06:23.015 --> 06:25.245
Okay, let's go.
Delia, your pen.

06:26.452 --> 06:28.613
<i>Hi, Bill. How you
doin'? Morning, Quince.</i>

06:28.688 --> 06:31.282
I'm doin' great, and you? Oh, I'm great.

06:31.357 --> 06:33.882
This is it, "B-day." Huh? Sorry.

06:33.960 --> 06:37.794
Bontecou day. We're gonna
close... with Big John.

06:37.864 --> 06:39.832
Look at you, Bill.
You're all cool as a cat.

06:39.899 --> 06:43.198
Over at Bontecou's, I'll bet
he's just shittin' in his pants.

06:43.269 --> 06:47.035
Remember, everybody, big
meeting tonight at Daddy's.

06:47.106 --> 06:50.803
Dinner. You, too, Drew.
We have lots of loose ends.

06:50.877 --> 06:54.438
Not my birthday again?
You're only 65 once, Dad.

06:54.514 --> 06:56.448
Thank God. Now let's
get the day started.

06:56.516 --> 06:59.110
<i>Remember, dinner in the city
at Daddy's!</i>

07:11.464 --> 07:14.695
Mm-hmm.
It's so ridiculous.

07:14.767 --> 07:16.792
<i>Do you love Drew?</i>

07:16.869 --> 07:20.168
<i>No, don't do anything.
Just stay exactly where...</i>

07:21.707 --> 07:26.041
<i>Do you love Drew? He's not gonna
get a better offer than that.</i>

07:26.112 --> 07:31.140
You mean, like you loved Mom?
Forget about me and Mom.

07:33.052 --> 07:37.751
<i>- Are you gonna marry him?
Oh, come on.</i>

07:38.825 --> 07:40.759
I'm probably.

07:40.827 --> 07:43.694
Listen, I'm crazy about the
guy. He's smart. He's aggressive.

07:43.763 --> 07:48.757
<i>He could carry Parrish Communications
into the 21st century and me along with it.</i>

07:48.835 --> 07:51.770
Mm-hmm.
So, what's wrong with that?

07:51.838 --> 07:54.238
That's for me.
I'm talking about you.

07:55.775 --> 07:58.744
<i>It's not what you say about
Drew. It's what you don't say.</i>

07:59.846 --> 08:01.711
Maybe you're not listening.

08:01.781 --> 08:03.715
Oh, yes, I am.

08:03.783 --> 08:05.774
<i>Give him whatever he wants.</i>

08:05.852 --> 08:10.687
There's not an ounce of excitement,
not a... whisper of a thrill.

08:10.756 --> 08:14.624
And this relationship has all
the passion of a pair of titmice.

08:14.694 --> 08:17.060
<i>I want you to get
swept away out there.</i>

08:17.129 --> 08:19.996
I want you to levitate.
I want you to...

08:20.066 --> 08:22.466
sing with rapture
and dance like a dervish.

08:22.535 --> 08:25.299
- Oh, that's all.
- Yeah. Be deliriously happy,

08:25.371 --> 08:27.737
or at least
leave yourself open to be.

08:28.941 --> 08:31.501
Okay.

08:31.577 --> 08:34.102
"Be deliriously happy."
I shall, uh...

08:34.179 --> 08:36.375
I shall do my utmost.

08:40.086 --> 08:42.611
I know it's
a cornball thing.

08:43.688 --> 08:46.317
But love is passion,

08:46.392 --> 08:48.326
obsession,

08:48.394 --> 08:51.124
someone
you can't live without.

08:51.197 --> 08:53.995
<i>I say,
fall head over heels.</i>

08:54.066 --> 08:58.799
Find someone you can love like crazy
and who will love you the same way back.

08:58.871 --> 09:03.808
How do you find him? Well, you forget
your head, and you listen to your heart.

09:03.876 --> 09:05.810
And I'm not hearing
any heart.

09:05.878 --> 09:10.747
<i>'Cause the truth is, honey, there's
no sense living your life without this.</i>

09:10.816 --> 09:15.082
To make the journey
and not fall deeply in love,

09:15.154 --> 09:18.282
well, you haven't lived
a life at all.

09:19.959 --> 09:24.589
<i>But you have to try, 'cause if you
haven't tried, you haven't lived.</i>

09:25.665 --> 09:28.293
Bravo!

09:28.367 --> 09:30.335
Oh, you're tough.

09:33.205 --> 09:35.901
I'm sorry.
Okay.

09:35.975 --> 09:39.138
Give it to me again, but
the short version this time.

09:39.211 --> 09:42.009
Okay.
Stay open.

09:42.081 --> 09:45.312
Who knows?
Lightning could strike.

09:47.219 --> 09:50.985
Yeah?

09:51.057 --> 09:52.991
Yeah.

10:02.101 --> 10:05.366
<i>What do you think? Is it
just the executive committee,</i>

10:05.438 --> 10:07.429
or are you guys
gonna use me?

10:07.506 --> 10:10.566
Quince, man, thanks for the offer,
but it's all set for just me and Bill.

10:10.643 --> 10:15.444
More people might... I know.
I know, gum up the works.

10:15.514 --> 10:18.108
"I want you
to get swept away."

10:18.184 --> 10:20.880
Huh? I was just sayin' to Quince
that we won't need him until...

10:20.953 --> 10:22.921
Did you hear something? Yeah,
but I was just sayin' to Quince...

10:22.989 --> 10:25.389
No, no, no. Not you.
What's the matter, Daddy?

10:29.128 --> 10:31.722
Nothing. I'm sorry.
"I want you to levitate.

10:31.797 --> 10:35.255
I want you to sing with rapture
and dance like a dervish."

10:36.502 --> 10:39.630
"Dance like a dervish"?
Daddy, what is it?

10:41.140 --> 10:44.166
Nothing, I'm just talking
to myself. You know me.

10:44.243 --> 10:46.711
No, I've never known you
to talk to yourself.

10:46.779 --> 10:49.942
Oh, well,
can I give you a lift?

10:50.016 --> 10:53.611
No, I'm gonna catch a cab.
Listen, are you okay? Yeah.

10:53.686 --> 10:56.712
Got my garters on, my ears
pricked... ready for action.

10:56.789 --> 10:58.780
Okay. Well...
Go get 'em, Pops.

10:58.858 --> 11:01.292
You're damn right.
Okay.

11:04.563 --> 11:08.090
<i>Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.</i>

11:08.167 --> 11:10.101
<i>Oh, haven't heard
that one before.</i>

11:10.169 --> 11:12.967
<i>I'm sorry.
I had to say it.</i>

11:13.039 --> 11:16.008
<i>Honey? Honey?
Hi, George.</i>

11:16.075 --> 11:19.841
Honey, you have to go on.

11:19.912 --> 11:22.142
Okay? There's a time to
sow and a time to reap.

11:22.214 --> 11:24.444
You have to sow.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.917
<i>Sorry.
Excuse me.</i>

11:26.986 --> 11:28.920
No, I liked him.
I don't like him anymore.

11:28.988 --> 11:31.252
<i>'Cause you're my honey.</i>

11:31.323 --> 11:33.314
Someone messes with you,
they mess with me.

11:33.392 --> 11:36.828
That's it. I'm on a plane in
a heartbeat. You let me know.

11:36.896 --> 11:40.957
Yep, when I get my phone in,
you're my first call. I promise.

11:41.033 --> 11:44.093
Hit the books, get the degree. One day
we'll be hanging out a shingle together.

11:44.170 --> 11:46.297
How's that?
Mmm? Okay.

11:46.372 --> 11:49.569
You all right?
Yes.

11:49.642 --> 11:52.236
<i>You bet.
Be strong.</i>

11:52.311 --> 11:54.506
<i>I love you.
Bye-bye.</i>

12:10.629 --> 12:13.120
Morning.
Good morning.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.504
I was talkin' kind of
loud there. I'm sorry.

12:19.572 --> 12:22.507
Oh, not at all.

12:23.576 --> 12:25.806
It was fascinating.

12:27.246 --> 12:29.180
Yeah, what was fascinating
about it?

12:29.248 --> 12:32.115
Um...
You and, uh, "honey"?

12:35.955 --> 12:38.014
It's my kid sister.
Oh.

12:39.525 --> 12:41.459
And she just broke up with her
boyfriend and was thinking...

12:41.527 --> 12:43.791
about dropping out
of law school.

12:43.863 --> 12:47.458
Oh, I'm sorry. No,
nothing to be sorry about.

12:47.533 --> 12:51.629
That's the way it is with men and
women, isn't it? What's the way?

12:51.704 --> 12:53.729
Nothing lasts.

12:53.806 --> 12:55.899
Oh. Yeah, I agree.

12:55.975 --> 12:58.136
Really? Why?

13:00.312 --> 13:02.872
No, I'm interested.

13:04.750 --> 13:06.684
I was just trying
to be agreeable.

13:08.754 --> 13:12.349
- Okay. All right.
I was sharpshooting.

13:12.424 --> 13:15.916
<i>Oh. No, just that "nothing lasts" stuff.</i>

13:15.995 --> 13:18.327
<i>That was the problem with Honey's
guy. He didn't know what he wanted.</i>

13:18.397 --> 13:21.525
So, he's fooling around,
and she catches him at it.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.659
You know, like one girlfriend
isn't enough for him.

13:25.938 --> 13:29.237
- So, you're a one-girl guy.
- Yes, I am.

13:30.910 --> 13:32.844
<i>That's right.
Right.</i>

13:34.246 --> 13:36.180
Looking for her
right now, actually.

13:36.248 --> 13:39.240
<i>Mmm. Who knows?
You might be her.</i>

13:39.318 --> 13:41.582
<i>No, don't laugh.
I just got into town.</i>

13:41.654 --> 13:43.815
I got the new job.

13:43.889 --> 13:46.119
I'm trying to get
into this apartment.

13:49.962 --> 13:52.294
Anyway,
so you're a doctor.

13:52.364 --> 13:54.298
Mmm.
How'd you know?

13:54.366 --> 13:56.891
'Cause everyone's
a doctor around here.

13:56.969 --> 14:02.066
This apartment building... Everyone's
in green slippers, the green pajamas.

14:02.141 --> 14:04.075
The guy I'm waiting for
to vacate...

14:04.143 --> 14:06.407
doctor.
He's a doctor.

14:06.478 --> 14:09.311
What kind of doctor?

14:09.381 --> 14:11.474
I'm a resident...
internal medicine.

14:12.952 --> 14:14.886
So, if I needed a doctor,
you could be it.

14:14.954 --> 14:17.218
I could be her.
Yeah.

14:17.289 --> 14:19.280
You could be...
her.

14:19.358 --> 14:21.292
Uh-huh.

14:22.661 --> 14:24.822
Yeah, I could.

14:27.800 --> 14:31.395
<i>I'm-I'm working at the
hospital, so... I see.</i>

14:31.470 --> 14:34.405
<i>This is my lucky day. I just
get in the big, bad city,</i>

14:34.473 --> 14:36.839
not only do I find a doctor,
but a beautiful woman, as well.

14:42.081 --> 14:44.015
Do you mind me saying that?

14:44.083 --> 14:46.483
Oh... No, of course.
No, it's fine.

14:46.552 --> 14:48.486
It's fine.
It's just...

14:48.554 --> 14:51.148
Listen, could I
buy you a cup of coffee?

14:53.392 --> 14:57.294
<i>I have some patients coming in,
so I should probably... Yeah, yeah.</i>

14:57.363 --> 14:59.991
<i>Get goin'. I gotta get to the
apartment and get off to work.</i>

15:00.065 --> 15:01.930
<i>Yeah. But I'd still like to
have another cup of coffee.</i>

15:03.836 --> 15:06.168
- Um...
- Would you let me do that?

15:06.238 --> 15:10.834
- Well, yeah, okay.
- Deal.

15:12.278 --> 15:14.212
Mmm.

15:37.603 --> 15:39.935
Good morning, Mr.
Parrish. Morning, Jennifer.

15:40.005 --> 15:41.939
So, board convenes tomorrow.

15:42.007 --> 15:44.168
You'll recommend we close,
and it's a deal, right?

15:45.778 --> 15:48.372
As close as a deal
could be.

15:48.447 --> 15:50.381
Olympic.

16:10.636 --> 16:13.503
Yes.

16:26.919 --> 16:28.853
Yes.

16:31.357 --> 16:34.690
"Yes" what? Yes is the
answer to your question.

16:34.760 --> 16:36.694
Ah.

16:39.331 --> 16:41.765
I didn't ask any question.

16:41.834 --> 16:43.768
I believe you did.

16:44.837 --> 16:48.102
Who are you?

16:49.475 --> 16:53.571
Goddamn it. What's going
on here? I think you know.

16:53.645 --> 16:56.409
I don't.
Try.

16:57.950 --> 17:01.647
"'Cause if you haven't tried,
you haven't lived."

17:05.156 --> 17:07.590
What are you talking about?

17:07.659 --> 17:09.593
What you were talking about.

17:12.397 --> 17:14.332
Who is this guy?

17:16.801 --> 17:19.737
Tell me who you are.
Are you giving me orders?

17:19.805 --> 17:23.468
- No. I'm sorry, I...
- No, you're not.

17:23.541 --> 17:26.067
<i>You're trying
to handle the situation.</i>

17:26.145 --> 17:31.606
But this is the one situation
you knew you never could handle.

17:38.090 --> 17:40.024
It's enough...

17:41.894 --> 17:43.828
now.

17:57.076 --> 17:59.010
Huh?

18:03.282 --> 18:05.250
Talk to me, please.

18:06.385 --> 18:09.047
There's gonna be
plenty of time for that.

18:10.622 --> 18:12.556
What do you mean?

18:15.027 --> 18:18.258
I think you know, Bill.

18:26.805 --> 18:28.796
It's kind of
a pro bono job.

18:28.874 --> 18:30.865
"Pro bono"?
Yeah.

18:30.943 --> 18:33.207
Meaning, doing good?
That's me.

18:33.278 --> 18:35.212
Gonna be doing good
all your life?

18:37.149 --> 18:41.643
I know what you're saying. It doesn't
pay so well, but, I like it. Mm-hmm.

18:41.720 --> 18:45.986
<i>Eventually it'll depend
on the woman I marry, I think.</i>

18:46.058 --> 18:50.119
Maybe she'll want lots of kids,
a bigger house, better car, uh...

18:50.195 --> 18:52.755
College doesn't come cheap.
You know? I don't know.

18:54.333 --> 18:58.030
Wow. Give up what you want
for the woman you marry.

18:58.103 --> 19:00.037
<i>Hmm.</i>

19:00.105 --> 19:02.403
Yeah, you know what?
I would.

19:02.474 --> 19:04.442
<i>Yeah?
Gladly.</i>

19:05.777 --> 19:08.712
'Cause you make your choices,
you know?

19:08.780 --> 19:12.375
Say, you and I, if we were married,
I would... No, for an example, okay?

19:12.451 --> 19:14.942
If you and I were married, I would
want to give you what you need.

19:15.020 --> 19:18.217
That's all. I'm talking about taking
care of each other the best you can.

19:18.290 --> 19:21.123
What's wrong with taking care of
a woman? She takes care of you.

19:21.193 --> 19:24.253
You'll have a hard time finding
a woman like that these days.

19:24.329 --> 19:27.264
- Shoot, you think so?
- Mm-hmm.

19:28.333 --> 19:31.632
I don't know.
Lightning could strike.

19:41.446 --> 19:43.505
I've gotta go.

19:43.582 --> 19:47.279
Yeah. Listen, did I say
something wrong? No? No.

19:47.352 --> 19:50.219
No. No. It was... Sure?

19:50.289 --> 19:53.156
It was so right, it
scares me. That's all.

19:53.225 --> 19:55.159
Just...

19:58.096 --> 20:00.496
You know, I was thinking, I
don't want you to be my doctor.

20:00.566 --> 20:04.400
I don't want you to...
examine me and...

20:04.469 --> 20:06.767
Why?

20:08.407 --> 20:10.341
Because I like you
so much.

20:19.985 --> 20:23.614
And I... I don't want
to examine you.

20:23.689 --> 20:27.250
You don't?
Why not?

20:27.326 --> 20:30.921
Because I like you
so much.

20:33.665 --> 20:36.395
Oh, boy.
Okay.

20:36.468 --> 20:39.460
Now I gotta go, so...

20:39.538 --> 20:42.371
Yep, understood.
All right. All right.

20:42.441 --> 20:44.807
Fair enough.
See ya.

20:44.876 --> 20:47.367
Bye. Bye.
Bye-bye.

22:27.546 --> 22:29.810
<i>Music.</i>

22:29.881 --> 22:33.442
<i>I know how you love music, Daddy. And
I want to have music that pleases you,</i>

22:33.518 --> 22:37.113
but doesn't put a thousand
other people to sleep.

22:37.189 --> 22:41.649
I've agonized over it and finally
settled on Sidney Brown. Good.

22:41.727 --> 22:45.493
Twenty-four men...
very eclectic. Mm-hmm.

22:45.564 --> 22:49.660
Plus, I'm feathering in
a Latin sextet on their breaks.

22:52.871 --> 22:55.772
You haven't heard
a word I've said, have you?

22:58.176 --> 23:00.736
What, honey? Sorry.
Daddy.

23:00.812 --> 23:02.746
Yes.

23:04.015 --> 23:05.949
<i>Daddy?</i>

23:06.017 --> 23:08.815
<i>Mr. Parrish?</i>

23:08.887 --> 23:11.913
- Yes?
- Dinner's served.

23:13.592 --> 23:17.528
Yeah.
Never mind.

23:17.596 --> 23:19.530
Leave it to me.

23:25.370 --> 23:28.305
Did you miss me, Bill?

23:30.275 --> 23:32.266
Chow time, you guys.

23:34.279 --> 23:36.770
What are you looking
so provoked about?

23:37.849 --> 23:40.147
Did you miss me?

23:40.218 --> 23:42.550
It's a normal question.

23:42.621 --> 23:46.284
I missed you.
But what do I get back?

23:46.358 --> 23:48.519
"Not an ounce of excitement.

23:48.593 --> 23:50.527
"Not a whisper of a thrill.

23:52.063 --> 23:55.692
This relationship has all the
passion of a pair of titmice."

23:58.737 --> 24:01.069
I'm waiting outside
the front door.

24:01.139 --> 24:03.073
<i>Did you speak
to the governor?</i>

24:03.141 --> 24:05.871
He's coming.
And his wife?

24:05.944 --> 24:08.310
Yeah, unfortunately.

24:08.380 --> 24:11.508
I sat between them at the Bronx Zoo
benefit. It was better than Seconal.

24:11.583 --> 24:15.314
I'm waiting outside
the front door, Bill.

24:16.955 --> 24:19.423
Won't someone let me in?

24:20.926 --> 24:22.860
Lillian?

24:27.632 --> 24:30.157
Is there somebody at the front
door? I didn't hear a ring, sir.

24:30.235 --> 24:32.169
Have a look,
would you, please?

24:33.238 --> 24:35.172
<i>What about the mayor?</i>

24:35.240 --> 24:37.868
<i>He said he's going to be
there with bells on. Good.</i>

24:37.943 --> 24:40.411
<i>- Maybe they'll drown him out.
- Please don't be negative, Drew.</i>

24:40.479 --> 24:44.779
<i>I'm sorry. We have an acceptance list
that would do the White House proud:</i>

24:44.850 --> 24:48.286
The chairman of the F.C.C., the
Secretary General of the U.N.,

24:48.353 --> 24:50.480
<i>Wow.
Nine senators,</i>

24:50.555 --> 24:55.686
<i>I don't know how many congressmen
and at least 12 of the Fortune 500.</i>

24:55.760 --> 24:59.161
Any jocks? Hmm? No.

24:59.231 --> 25:02.689
No 20-game-winner, Masters
champion, someone I can talk to?

25:05.570 --> 25:08.596
You were right, Mr. Parrish.
There was a gentleman at the door.

25:08.673 --> 25:11.164
<i>He's waiting for you
in the foyer.</i>

25:14.112 --> 25:18.048
<i>Show him into the library. Tell
him I'll be right there. Yes, sir.</i>

25:18.116 --> 25:21.608
<i>I've arranged favors, silver
charm bracelets for the women,</i>

25:21.686 --> 25:23.881
<i>Mmm. And platinum key
chains for the men,</i>

25:23.955 --> 25:26.549
all engraved "W.P."

25:26.625 --> 25:30.493
But now I'm thinking of scrubbing
them. They seem so ordinary.

25:30.562 --> 25:32.962
<i>Are they ordinary?</i>

25:33.031 --> 25:34.965
<i>Do they seem that way
to you, Daddy?</i>

25:36.034 --> 25:37.968
I don't know.

25:38.036 --> 25:40.800
I don't know.
I, uh...

25:48.280 --> 25:50.407
Let me see.

25:50.482 --> 25:52.416
I don't think
they're ordinary.

25:52.484 --> 25:54.611
I think they're great.

25:54.686 --> 25:56.620
I love key chains.

26:13.438 --> 26:15.372
Hello?

26:19.444 --> 26:21.378
Anyone here?

26:24.916 --> 26:28.147
I said, is anyone here?
Quiet down.

26:35.126 --> 26:37.993
Where are you?
I'm here.

26:42.567 --> 26:45.035
What is this,
a joke, right?

26:45.103 --> 26:47.936
Some kind of elaborate
practical joke?

26:50.942 --> 26:55.072
At my 40th reunion,
we delivered a casket...

26:55.146 --> 26:58.377
to the class president's
hotel room and, uh...

26:58.450 --> 27:00.384
Quiet.

27:07.092 --> 27:10.323
Where are you going,
Bill?

27:10.395 --> 27:12.659
I, uh...

27:12.731 --> 27:15.598
The great Bill Parrish
at a loss for words?

27:15.667 --> 27:20.570
The man from whose lips fall "rapture"
and "passion" and "obsession"?

27:20.639 --> 27:24.575
All those admonitions about
being " deliriously happy,

27:24.643 --> 27:27.339
that there is no sense
living your life without."

27:27.412 --> 27:29.346
All the sparks and energy
you give off,

27:29.414 --> 27:33.612
the rosy advice you dispense
in round, pear-shaped tones.

27:39.324 --> 27:41.451
What the hell is this?

27:50.702 --> 27:52.636
Who are you?

27:54.572 --> 27:57.370
Just think of millenniums
multiplied by eons...

27:57.442 --> 28:00.036
compounded by time without end.

28:00.111 --> 28:02.238
I've been around that long.

28:02.313 --> 28:07.114
But it's only recently that your
affairs here have piqued my interest.

28:07.185 --> 28:09.517
<i>Call it boredom.</i>

28:09.587 --> 28:12.283
<i>The natural curiosity of me,
the most lasting...</i>

28:12.357 --> 28:16.885
<i>and significant element in
existence, has come to see you.</i>

28:18.663 --> 28:20.597
About what?

28:21.833 --> 28:25.428
I want to have a look around
before I take you.

28:27.372 --> 28:29.306
Take me where?

28:30.575 --> 28:34.511
It requires competence,
wisdom and experience.

28:34.579 --> 28:38.242
All those things they say
about you in testimonials.

28:38.316 --> 28:40.284
And you're the one.

28:41.653 --> 28:44.144
<i>The one to do what?
Show me around,</i>

28:45.223 --> 28:47.885
be my guide.

28:47.959 --> 28:51.156
And in return, you get...

28:53.565 --> 28:55.499
I get what?

28:57.235 --> 28:59.362
Time:

28:59.437 --> 29:02.600
Minutes, days, weeks.

29:02.674 --> 29:04.608
Let's not get encumbered
by detail.

29:04.676 --> 29:07.645
<i>What matters is
that I stay interested.</i>

29:13.918 --> 29:15.886
Yes.

29:18.256 --> 29:20.190
"Yes" what?

29:20.258 --> 29:23.386
<i>Yes is the answer
to your question.</i>

29:26.698 --> 29:28.632
<i>What question?
Oh, Bill.</i>

29:28.700 --> 29:31.464
Come on.
The question.

29:31.536 --> 29:35.438
The question you've been asking
yourself with increased regularity,

29:35.507 --> 29:38.635
at odd moments, panting through
the extra game of handball,

29:38.710 --> 29:40.837
<i>when you ran for the plane
in Delhi,</i>

29:40.912 --> 29:44.473
<i>when you sat up in bed last night and
hit the floor in the office this morning.</i>

29:44.549 --> 29:48.144
The question that is in
the back of your throat,

29:48.219 --> 29:50.653
choking the blood
to your brain,

29:50.722 --> 29:56.524
ringing in your ears over and
over as you put it to yourself.

29:58.763 --> 30:00.856
<i>"The question."
Yes, Bill.</i>

30:00.932 --> 30:02.866
"The question."

30:08.339 --> 30:10.273
The question.

30:15.713 --> 30:17.647
Am I going to die?

30:27.692 --> 30:29.626
Yes.

30:36.034 --> 30:38.093
Am I dreaming this?

30:38.169 --> 30:40.103
Are you a dream?

30:41.339 --> 30:43.273
I'm not a dream.

30:44.442 --> 30:46.376
<i>You're coming to take me?</i>

30:47.846 --> 30:49.780
What is that?

30:49.848 --> 30:51.782
And who the hell are you?

31:23.181 --> 31:25.115
You are...

31:26.317 --> 31:28.478
Yes?

31:32.924 --> 31:35.085
Who am I?

31:44.736 --> 31:46.670
Death.

31:51.542 --> 31:53.476
You're Death?

31:55.079 --> 31:57.707
Yes.

32:03.354 --> 32:06.812
Death.
That's me.

32:09.060 --> 32:10.994
You're not Death. You're
just a kid in a suit.

32:11.062 --> 32:13.997
The suit came with
the body I took.

32:14.065 --> 32:16.863
Let me ask your opinion.

32:16.935 --> 32:18.869
Do I blend in?

32:23.775 --> 32:26.175
You want me
to be your guide?

32:26.244 --> 32:28.303
You fill the bill,
Bill.

32:28.379 --> 32:30.313
I do?
Mmm.

32:32.116 --> 32:34.050
Will you
be staying long?

32:34.118 --> 32:36.143
We should hope
quite a while.

32:37.989 --> 32:39.923
And then?

32:46.531 --> 32:48.465
It's over.

32:49.834 --> 32:52.394
It's over.

32:52.470 --> 32:55.064
<i>Mr. Parrish?</i>

32:55.139 --> 32:57.107
Will the gentleman be staying
for dinner, sir?

32:59.043 --> 33:00.908
Yes.

33:05.016 --> 33:06.950
Thank you.

33:10.855 --> 33:12.789
This is crazy.

33:15.159 --> 33:17.093
You're not gonna
eat dinner with us.

33:17.161 --> 33:20.619
No, I am eating dinner
with you... and your family.

33:20.698 --> 33:22.632
And that is what
we're doing.

33:22.700 --> 33:26.898
It's not open for
discussion, nothing is.

33:26.971 --> 33:29.565
Don't you understand?

33:32.477 --> 33:34.809
Yeah.

33:34.879 --> 33:37.040
Good.

33:37.115 --> 33:39.049
Now lead the way.

33:40.351 --> 33:43.081
Bill,

33:43.154 --> 33:45.088
lead the way.

33:52.563 --> 33:57.398
Excuse me, may I say
something? Yes, of course.

33:57.468 --> 33:59.698
Well, it just occurred
to me, if, uh...

33:59.771 --> 34:01.636
Speak up, please.

34:01.706 --> 34:06.575
When I introduce you,
if I say who you are,

34:06.644 --> 34:09.579
I don't think anyone
will stay for dinner.

34:10.648 --> 34:12.616
Then don't.

34:12.683 --> 34:14.844
Here's another possibility.

34:14.918 --> 34:18.878
It's a little last minute,
but tell me what you think.

34:18.956 --> 34:20.889
Kaleidoscopes.

34:22.092 --> 34:24.118
Little gold kaleidoscopes.

34:24.195 --> 34:27.027
Some German company went kerplunk, and
Tiffany's picked all these things up,

34:27.098 --> 34:29.965
and they're perfect
party favors.

34:30.034 --> 34:33.197
Okay, they're not personalized or
anything. They're just winter scenes...

34:33.271 --> 34:35.205
dachshunds, snowflakes.

34:38.943 --> 34:40.877
Hi there.

34:43.214 --> 34:45.148
Hello.

34:46.284 --> 34:49.549
Sorry to have...
stepped away for so long.

34:49.620 --> 34:52.783
This is a friend of mine
I asked to drop by.

34:52.857 --> 34:56.293
We got to talking
and stuff, and, uh...

34:58.029 --> 34:59.963
He's gonna join us
for dinner.

35:02.633 --> 35:05.431
Great.
How nice to meet you.

35:05.503 --> 35:08.631
And wouldn't it be nicer if
my father would introduce you?

35:09.941 --> 35:11.875
How nice to meet you.

35:13.711 --> 35:17.408
Yeah, I'm sorry. This is my daughter,
Allison, and her husband, Quince,

35:17.482 --> 35:20.280
<i>and Drew, my number one,
works with me.</i>

35:21.886 --> 35:24.184
Daddy, does your friend
have a name?

35:24.255 --> 35:28.885
- A name?
- Something he goes by?

35:31.229 --> 35:33.925
Oh, yeah, excuse me.
This is, uh...

35:33.998 --> 35:35.932
This is, um...

35:36.000 --> 35:39.060
Daddy, come on. A name. Bill,
the suspense is killing me.

35:39.137 --> 35:42.072
I'm sorry. It's, uh... It's
gone right out of my head. Um...

35:44.242 --> 35:47.678
I'm sorry.
This is... Joe.

35:47.745 --> 35:51.078
<i>Joe. I love that name.
- Just plain Joe.</i>

35:51.149 --> 35:53.777
Me too.
Hey, buddy.

35:55.186 --> 35:59.020
- Is there any more to it?
- What do you mean?

35:59.090 --> 36:02.116
Like "Smith"
or "Jones" or...

36:07.031 --> 36:10.194
<i>Black.
Oh, at last.</i>

36:10.268 --> 36:13.499
Nice to meet you, Mr.
Black. Hey, hey, Joe Black.

36:13.571 --> 36:16.540
Won 15, lost 2
for the Brooklyn Dodgers, 1952.

36:16.607 --> 36:18.541
<i>I'm king of
my rotisserie league.</i>

36:18.609 --> 36:21.407
Are you?
Yeah, he is.

36:22.980 --> 36:25.380
Shall we sit down?

36:25.449 --> 36:27.383
Right there.

37:13.831 --> 37:17.198
Have we met?

37:18.936 --> 37:22.497
- He's from out of town.
- How long you here for, Joe?

37:23.574 --> 37:26.304
As long as it takes.

37:28.446 --> 37:32.348
<i>You and Bill, you old friends? No.</i>

37:36.187 --> 37:38.678
No, thank you.

37:38.756 --> 37:41.281
I have one, thank you.

37:41.359 --> 37:44.954
<i>- I get the feeling you've done some business before.
- I got it.</i>

37:46.597 --> 37:48.622
Have you done
some business before?

37:50.268 --> 37:52.463
We have an arrangement now.

37:56.307 --> 37:59.299
What side of the industry
did you say you were on?

37:59.377 --> 38:01.971
I didn't say.

38:03.447 --> 38:05.381
Joe sounds like
a ringer, Bill.

38:05.449 --> 38:08.384
<i>I have a feeling you guys got
the broad strokes already.</i>

38:08.452 --> 38:10.420
You need any help
with the details?

38:12.990 --> 38:15.322
I'm sorry,
business at dinner.

38:17.128 --> 38:21.189
Forgive me for being so rude. Certainly.

38:21.265 --> 38:23.233
<i>Hi, everybody.
I'm sorry I'm late.</i>

38:23.301 --> 38:27.237
- I had to have dinner with my department chief.
- You ate?

38:27.305 --> 38:29.398
I'm here, aren't I? I wouldn't
miss a loose ends meeting.

38:29.473 --> 38:33.068
What's on the table for
discussion? Party favors, flowers...

38:33.144 --> 38:35.078
Hi, Dad.
Hi.

38:35.146 --> 38:37.080
Hello.
Hi, Drew.

38:41.986 --> 38:44.454
What are you doing here?

38:44.522 --> 38:47.252
You know each other?

38:50.761 --> 38:53.229
We've met.

38:54.765 --> 38:57.427
<i>This morning,
the Corinth Coffee Shop.</i>

38:57.501 --> 39:00.197
He was, uh...
He was looking for a doctor.

39:00.271 --> 39:04.037
<i>Well, I guess
he's found one.</i>

39:04.108 --> 39:06.076
Joe,
you do get around.

39:06.143 --> 39:08.907
<i>That's your name?
And isn't it a lovely one?</i>

39:08.979 --> 39:12.881
So sturdy, so straight.
Stop it.

39:12.950 --> 39:17.319
<i>Incidentally, Joe,
where are you staying?</i>

39:18.589 --> 39:21.717
- Here.
- You're staying here?

39:21.792 --> 39:27.321
- In this house?
- Yes, in this house.

39:27.398 --> 39:31.425
<i>Great. Great.
Great.</i>

39:31.502 --> 39:34.232
Will that hold you, Joe?

39:34.305 --> 39:36.466
Incidentally, Joe what?

39:36.540 --> 39:38.667
Black.

39:38.743 --> 39:40.734
This is fun.

39:40.811 --> 39:43.575
Yes.
Yes, Quince, it is.

39:43.647 --> 39:45.842
So, what are you doing
here, Joe?

39:53.891 --> 39:56.519
Cat got your tongue?

39:56.594 --> 39:59.324
You weren't so silent
this morning.

40:01.031 --> 40:03.761
This morning, yes.

40:05.536 --> 40:07.470
I wasn't quite myself.

40:09.006 --> 40:13.466
Well, it's a shame whoever you
were couldn't be here tonight.

40:13.544 --> 40:15.603
<i>Cut it out, Susan.
We've gotta talk.</i>

40:15.679 --> 40:18.307
<i>Busy day tomorrow,
everybody.</i>

40:19.917 --> 40:22.613
Joe, let's go.

40:22.686 --> 40:24.620
Yes.

40:33.464 --> 40:36.797
That stuff between
you and Susan threw me.

40:36.867 --> 40:38.801
Threw you?
Where?

40:38.869 --> 40:40.803
Shook me up.

40:42.239 --> 40:44.901
I mean, how is it that you
happened to meet my daughter?

40:44.975 --> 40:47.136
I didn't meet her.

40:47.211 --> 40:49.145
The young man I took
met her.

40:49.213 --> 40:52.649
That is, the fellow she encountered
in the coffee shop this morning.

40:54.084 --> 40:56.018
What happened to him?

40:56.086 --> 40:59.055
I needed a body, Bill.

41:02.927 --> 41:04.861
So,

41:08.165 --> 41:10.099
come in.

41:12.603 --> 41:18.337
Uh, bathroom,
tub, towels, sauna,

41:18.409 --> 41:21.469
chairs, lamps, bed.

41:37.461 --> 41:40.089
Well, if there
is anything else,

41:42.166 --> 41:44.600
don't hesitate.
I won't.

42:59.510 --> 43:01.978
I can try. Will she
be available next week?

43:02.046 --> 43:03.980
I don't know.

43:05.683 --> 43:07.651
Yes, sir?

43:07.718 --> 43:10.551
Hello.
I'm Joe Black.

43:10.621 --> 43:12.555
It's nice meeting you.

43:12.623 --> 43:14.887
Yes, of course,
Mr. Black, sir.

43:14.959 --> 43:17.393
A pleasure.

43:17.461 --> 43:19.395
Eh...

43:20.464 --> 43:22.762
What is that?

43:22.833 --> 43:25.131
You mean this, sir?
Yes.

43:25.202 --> 43:28.694
It's, uh, Laura Scudder's
peanut butter, sir.

43:30.741 --> 43:32.675
You like it?

43:32.743 --> 43:35.371
Well, I would say,
in my opinion,

43:35.446 --> 43:39.473
it's right up there
with Jif and Skippy.

43:39.550 --> 43:41.484
Could I offer you
a taste, sir?

43:43.220 --> 43:45.154
Yes.
All right.

44:19.356 --> 44:21.290
Do you fancy it, sir?

44:23.661 --> 44:26.357
More?

44:26.430 --> 44:28.364
Right.

44:37.074 --> 44:39.008
Mmm.

44:41.679 --> 44:44.477
Mmm.

44:44.548 --> 44:47.381
You're a peanut butter man
now, eh, sir?

44:49.486 --> 44:52.114
Yes,
I believe I am.

44:53.390 --> 44:55.881
I thoroughly enjoy
this peanut butter.

44:57.294 --> 44:59.489
And I thoroughly enjoyed
meeting you all.

45:00.864 --> 45:03.799
I'll be moseying on.
Right, sir.

45:35.666 --> 45:37.600
What are you doing here?

45:40.037 --> 45:42.471
I'm lost.

45:44.808 --> 45:46.935
I can't seem
to escape you today.

45:47.010 --> 45:50.707
<i>I'm sorry.
Yeah.</i>

46:10.467 --> 46:12.401
Would you hand me
one of those?

46:28.485 --> 46:33.081
You must have something very...
big going on with my father.

46:33.157 --> 46:35.091
Big?
Yeah.

46:36.260 --> 46:38.660
You appear at his side
out of the blue,

46:38.729 --> 46:40.720
stay at his house,
have dinner with his family.

46:40.798 --> 46:44.825
That's, uh,
practically a first.

46:44.902 --> 46:48.269
You're in the red-hot center
of big business,

46:48.338 --> 46:50.272
and I thought you were
just a regular Joe.

46:51.809 --> 46:55.836
I am Joe. Not the one
that I met this morning.

46:55.913 --> 47:00.213
Hitting on me in as nice a way as
I've been hit on in a long time.

47:00.284 --> 47:04.243
The second that you found out I
was my father's daughter, you, uh...

47:04.321 --> 47:09.088
Well, you acted
like a stranger.

47:09.159 --> 47:11.593
That is not my intention.

47:13.330 --> 47:15.764
What are your intentions?

47:15.833 --> 47:19.564
Huh?
I mean, just to, uh,

47:19.636 --> 47:23.003
make little dramas in coffee
shops, turn a woman's head?

47:23.073 --> 47:25.906
I don't mind admitting
that my-my head was turned.

47:25.976 --> 47:28.376
I-I liked it.

47:28.445 --> 47:33.382
But, well, ten hours later,
I feel like a fool.

47:34.451 --> 47:36.885
I just don't get it.
I don't.

47:36.954 --> 47:39.252
You, my father, here in
this house. It's, uh...

47:39.323 --> 47:43.282
It's upsetting me,
and I...

47:43.360 --> 47:47.319
What happened to that sweet
guy from the coffee shop?

47:48.599 --> 47:50.533
Who are you, anyway?

47:51.969 --> 47:55.962
And...
what are you eating?

47:57.407 --> 47:59.341
Peanut butter.

48:02.145 --> 48:04.079
Hmm.

48:04.147 --> 48:06.081
But it's gone now.

48:11.855 --> 48:13.789
Wh... No. Please.

48:15.893 --> 48:19.090
You act like you've never had
peanut butter before. I haven't.

48:20.530 --> 48:23.294
What kind of childhood did
you have? Do you love Drew?

48:23.367 --> 48:25.494
Excuse me?

48:25.569 --> 48:28.538
When you put your mouth to
his, it seemed a frequent thing.

48:31.275 --> 48:33.368
Drew is
none of your business,

48:33.443 --> 48:36.139
and neither is where
I put my mouth.

48:36.213 --> 48:38.511
I'm sorry.
Do you live here?

48:38.582 --> 48:41.608
No, Joe, I'm swimming here
and now I'm going home.

48:41.685 --> 48:44.882
Yes, I think what
I'm trying to say is,

48:44.955 --> 48:47.617
I would like it
if we were friends.

48:47.691 --> 48:50.319
I've got
plenty of friends.

48:50.394 --> 48:53.056
I don't have any.

48:55.265 --> 48:57.665
Well, I can see why.

49:04.641 --> 49:07.041
I didn't mean
to offend you at dinner.

49:07.110 --> 49:09.442
I'm sometimes...

49:09.513 --> 49:13.313
not quite at home
around people.

49:15.252 --> 49:18.710
I get busy doing, uh,
what it is I do.

49:18.789 --> 49:22.816
And I don't seem
to have developed...

49:25.862 --> 49:28.023
Yes?

49:32.102 --> 49:37.904
I have a certain function to perform,
and it seems to take up most of my time.

49:39.242 --> 49:43.178
But sometimes I...
speculate...

49:45.682 --> 49:48.048
that I haven't
left room for...

49:50.988 --> 49:53.388
anything else.

49:56.860 --> 49:58.794
Hmm.

50:00.297 --> 50:02.629
I'm sorry to say
I know what you mean.

50:15.645 --> 50:17.579
Well, um...

50:20.550 --> 50:22.484
Good night, Joe.

50:22.552 --> 50:24.986
Yes.

50:25.055 --> 50:27.853
Good night to you,
Susan.

50:30.227 --> 50:32.787
Morning, Madeline. Oh,
good morning, Mr. Parrish.

50:32.863 --> 50:35.423
Everything okay?
Yes, sir.

50:35.499 --> 50:37.433
Good.

50:54.818 --> 50:57.116
Morning.

50:57.187 --> 50:59.519
Good morning, Bill.

51:05.095 --> 51:07.791
What's on the docket
for today?

51:07.864 --> 51:12.494
Docket? Hmm, yes. What shall we do?

51:12.569 --> 51:16.437
Well, I have to go to work,
and... Splendid. I'll join you.

51:16.506 --> 51:18.474
Oh.

51:18.542 --> 51:21.102
Would you like
to ride or walk?

51:21.178 --> 51:24.739
Walk. I wish
to see the world.

51:24.815 --> 51:29.445
This is crazy. This is the
left field thing of all time.

51:29.519 --> 51:33.046
I, uh... I don't know if
I can get through this.

51:33.123 --> 51:36.354
- What do I do? What do I tell my family?
- You'll get through this, Bill.

51:36.426 --> 51:39.953
As far as your family's concerned,
uh, I wouldn't say anything.

51:40.030 --> 51:42.999
You'll ruin the great start
we had last night.

51:43.066 --> 51:47.628
Hmm. It felt as if I was
being treated like a person.

51:47.704 --> 51:49.672
Yes, Joe this, Joe that.

51:49.739 --> 51:53.903
A nice smile.
Quince passed me the rolls.

51:53.977 --> 51:59.005
No passion or rapture or any of these
mighty things you're so intent on imparting.

51:59.082 --> 52:01.175
But I am certain,

52:01.251 --> 52:04.379
should you say who I am, our
adventure would end abruptly.

52:04.454 --> 52:06.888
Mm-hmm.

52:10.293 --> 52:13.319
And I did so enjoy
your family.

52:15.799 --> 52:19.599
What about my family? This
adventure involves only me, right?

52:19.669 --> 52:22.570
What do you mean?

52:25.909 --> 52:29.140
I'll tell you what. You promise
this undertaking of yours...

52:29.212 --> 52:31.180
involves only me
and, uh...

52:31.248 --> 52:33.682
And what?

52:33.750 --> 52:36.446
I won't tell anyone who
you are. Sounds fair enough.

52:36.520 --> 52:39.785
Good.
Is it a deal?

52:39.856 --> 52:42.518
A deal?
Yeah.

52:42.592 --> 52:45.584
You give your word; I give
mine that we'll do what we say.

52:45.662 --> 52:49.462
Mm-hmm. It is a truth
exchanged between two people.

52:49.533 --> 52:51.626
Bill?
What?

52:51.701 --> 52:54.829
You have a deal.
Ow!

53:01.411 --> 53:04.005
That's great.

53:06.783 --> 53:08.944
Great.

53:09.019 --> 53:12.716
You know,
I got to thinking.

53:12.789 --> 53:16.953
With you here
and seemingly occupied,

53:17.027 --> 53:20.053
how's your work going,
I mean, elsewhere?

53:20.130 --> 53:23.998
While you were shaving this
morning, you weren't just shaving.

53:24.067 --> 53:27.400
What do you mean?
You were hatching ideas,

53:27.470 --> 53:30.439
making plans, arriving
at decisions, right?

53:30.507 --> 53:32.475
Yeah, I guess so.

53:32.542 --> 53:36.273
So you understand the concept. While
part of you is busy doing one thing,

53:36.346 --> 53:40.976
another part of you is doing another, perhaps
even attending to the problems of your work.

53:41.051 --> 53:43.918
Correct?
Of course.

53:43.987 --> 53:47.684
So you understand the idea.
Congratulations, Bill.

53:47.757 --> 53:50.954
Now multiply that by infinity,
take that to the depths of forever,

53:51.027 --> 53:53.723
and you still will barely have a
glimpse of what I'm talking about.

54:00.637 --> 54:03.162
Joe?
Yes, Bill?

54:05.875 --> 54:08.309
How about giving
a guy a break?

54:08.378 --> 54:10.369
Make an exception?

54:10.447 --> 54:13.848
Well, there's one to
every rule. Not this.

54:13.917 --> 54:16.909
And call my family. I'd like them
to have dinner with me tonight.

54:16.987 --> 54:20.252
Didn't the family
get together last night?

54:20.323 --> 54:24.692
Jennifer. Of course,
Mr. Parrish, right away.

54:24.761 --> 54:27.662
Uh, perhaps you'd like
to wait in my office. No.

54:27.731 --> 54:31.633
What I'm trying to say is this is a
board meeting and you're not a member.

54:31.701 --> 54:35.398
I'm sure you'll find a way
to make it all right.

54:35.472 --> 54:38.566
Nice to meet you.

54:38.642 --> 54:40.610
Morning.

54:40.677 --> 54:42.645
Good morning.

54:45.081 --> 54:47.106
Thank you.
Eddie.

54:47.183 --> 54:49.515
Uh, this is Joe Black.

54:49.586 --> 54:54.614
He's a personal associate of
mine, and, uh... Hello, Quince.

54:54.691 --> 54:57.159
<i>Hey. He'll be joining us this morning.</i>

54:57.227 --> 55:01.493
<i>I know this is unusual,
and my apologies, and, uh...</i>

55:01.564 --> 55:04.465
<i>Drew, carry on.
It's nice to see you.</i>

55:04.534 --> 55:07.697
Didn't expect you,
but, uh...

55:07.771 --> 55:09.830
certainly you can't get
enough of a good thing.

55:09.906 --> 55:13.467
Thank you. Joe, would
you like to sit there?

55:25.121 --> 55:27.089
Okay.

55:27.157 --> 55:31.651
<i>Uh, the Board of Parrish Communications
is hereby called to order.</i>

55:31.728 --> 55:33.696
Our sole order of...

55:39.436 --> 55:42.200
Our s...

55:49.412 --> 55:52.074
Our sole order
of business today is a, uh...

55:52.148 --> 55:55.345
is an acceptance of
John Bontecou's generous offer.

55:55.418 --> 55:58.319
<i>And I think Bill... Do you have
any more of these delicious cookies?</i>

55:58.388 --> 56:00.652
<i>The jelly ones?</i>

56:00.724 --> 56:02.954
<i>Mmm, and a cup of tea.</i>

56:03.026 --> 56:07.963
With milk, I think. I'd like
to try it English style. Yes.

56:08.031 --> 56:09.999
<i>A cup of tea
with milk, please.</i>

56:10.066 --> 56:12.227
Is there anything else,
Mr. Black?

56:12.302 --> 56:14.668
- How about some water?
- Why, yes, thank you.

56:14.738 --> 56:16.672
<i>Hot or cold?
Cold.</i>

56:16.740 --> 56:20.676
- And a glass?
- Mmm.

56:24.714 --> 56:29.378
Uh, to review. We're really crossing
the T's and dotting the I's here.

56:29.452 --> 56:33.320
Uh, Bill had a great and conclusive
meeting yesterday with John Bontecou,

56:33.390 --> 56:36.382
and all that remains for us
is to put it to a vote.

56:39.062 --> 56:43.658
Um, thank you.
Drew, um...

56:44.968 --> 56:47.266
Yeah.

56:47.337 --> 56:50.238
I did enjoy, or rather
I was interested...

56:50.306 --> 56:54.709
in meeting
John Bontecou yesterday,

56:54.778 --> 56:56.905
and, um...

56:58.515 --> 57:03.350
Impressive, I suppose.

57:03.420 --> 57:05.354
But, uh...

57:09.259 --> 57:11.750
But...

57:11.828 --> 57:15.286
It did get me to thinking.

57:16.966 --> 57:21.198
<i>See, I started in this business
because this is what I wanted to do.</i>

57:21.271 --> 57:25.833
I knew I wasn't gonna write
the great American novel.

57:25.909 --> 57:29.208
But I also knew there was more to life
than buying something for a dollar...

57:29.279 --> 57:32.180
and selling it for two.

57:32.248 --> 57:35.740
<i>I'd hoped to create something,
something which could be...</i>

57:35.819 --> 57:38.788
held to
the highest standards.

57:38.855 --> 57:42.757
And what I realized
was I...

57:42.826 --> 57:46.159
I wanted to give
the news to the world.

57:46.229 --> 57:50.563
And I wanted
to give it unvarnished.

57:50.633 --> 57:55.093
Uh, the more we all know about each other,
the greater the chance we will survive.

57:55.171 --> 57:58.868
Sure, I want to make a profit. You
can't exist without one, but, uh...

57:58.942 --> 58:03.242
John Bontecou is all profit.

58:03.313 --> 58:08.216
<i>If we give him license to
absorb Parrish Communications...</i>

58:08.284 --> 58:10.343
<i>and he has his eye
on a few others after us...</i>

58:10.420 --> 58:12.718
in order to reach the world,

58:12.789 --> 58:16.725
you will have to go
through John Bontecou.

58:16.793 --> 58:18.886
And not only will you
have to pay him to do this,

58:18.962 --> 58:22.261
far more important, you'll
have to agree with him.

58:24.000 --> 58:27.834
<i>Reporting the news is a
privilege and a responsibility.</i>

58:27.904 --> 58:31.465
And it is not exploitable.

58:31.541 --> 58:34.772
Parrish Communications
has earned this privilege.

58:34.844 --> 58:38.302
John Bontecou
wants to buy it.

58:39.782 --> 58:42.512
<i>As your chairman,</i>

58:42.585 --> 58:45.110
I urge you to agree.

58:45.188 --> 58:48.316
This company
is not for sale.

58:54.264 --> 58:56.789
It sounds like you're not
leaving much room for discussion.

58:56.866 --> 58:58.800
Thank you.
You're welcome.

58:58.868 --> 59:01.302
I know. I'm sorry, I... Looks
like I'm reversing my field.

59:01.371 --> 59:03.999
That's your privilege, Bill.
But given our needs,

59:04.073 --> 59:06.837
given the absolute necessity
for growth, given the future,

59:06.910 --> 59:10.641
the truth is, joining John Bontecou is
every bit as certain as death and taxes.

59:10.713 --> 59:14.205
<i>Death and taxes?
Yes.</i>

59:14.284 --> 59:17.014
<i>- Death and taxes?
- Yes.</i>

59:17.086 --> 59:20.283
<i>What an odd pairing. It's
just a saying, Mr. Black.</i>

59:20.356 --> 59:22.950
<i>Mmm. By whom?
Doesn't matter.</i>

59:23.026 --> 59:26.393
- Then why'd
you bring it up?

59:26.462 --> 59:28.487
You're not familiar with
the phrase, "In this world,

59:28.565 --> 59:30.692
nothing is certain
but death and taxes?"

59:30.767 --> 59:33.327
<i>Well, I am now. Glad I
could be of some help.</i>

59:33.403 --> 59:36.600
<i>I keep regular office hours if there's
any further information you might need...</i>

59:36.673 --> 59:39.665
on sayings, common phrases,
manners of speaking.

59:39.742 --> 59:44.042
My door's wide open. The tea I
can provide, perhaps even the milk.

59:44.113 --> 59:46.206
Low fat.

59:46.282 --> 59:48.341
<i>Yeah, okay, well, uh...</i>

59:48.418 --> 59:52.149
I think we've accomplished everything we're
going to this morning. Shall we adjourn?

59:52.221 --> 59:56.180
- But the matter is still on the table, Bill.
- Joe?

59:56.259 --> 59:58.853
Yes.

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:08.264
Thank you for
the delicious cookies.

01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:13.404
Mmm.

01:00:15.812 --> 01:00:18.372
Who is that guy?

01:00:20.316 --> 01:00:22.250
So...

01:00:23.620 --> 01:00:25.986
what's the deal here?

01:00:26.055 --> 01:00:29.149
You gonna be breathing down my
neck right till the very end?

01:00:29.225 --> 01:00:32.661
I don't understand. I'd
like to be alone for a while.

01:00:35.498 --> 01:00:39.992
Are you sad, Bill?
Yes, I am.

01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:42.060
Why don't you take a walk
or something, get some air?

01:00:42.138 --> 01:00:44.732
I know
I'll be seeing you.

01:00:44.807 --> 01:00:48.402
Of course.

01:00:48.478 --> 01:00:51.743
Good. Now I'd like
to be alone.

01:00:51.814 --> 01:00:53.805
This will hold you
for a while.

01:00:53.883 --> 01:00:56.579
You know about money, don't
you? It can't buy happiness?

01:00:56.653 --> 01:00:59.486
Yeah.
Uh, Jennifer?

01:00:59.555 --> 01:01:02.820
Give Mr. Black a map of the
city, would you? It's okay, Bill.

01:01:02.892 --> 01:01:06.123
I can manage.

01:01:11.200 --> 01:01:13.134
Hi.
Hi.

01:01:13.202 --> 01:01:16.194
I need a medical record
number for labs. Uh-huh.

01:01:16.272 --> 01:01:20.834
And, uh, will you try calling
her husband? The number's on top.

01:01:26.549 --> 01:01:29.074
Also, can you page me
when C.T.'s ready?

01:01:29.152 --> 01:01:31.780
Oh, sure.
Thanks, sweetie.

01:01:34.457 --> 01:01:37.551
How nice you look.
Is that your uniform?

01:01:37.627 --> 01:01:40.152
What are you doing here?

01:01:42.799 --> 01:01:46.030
Are you ill?
Oh, goodness, no.

01:01:46.102 --> 01:01:49.799
Then why are you here,
Joe? I'm here to see you.

01:01:52.208 --> 01:01:55.837
Joe, I don't... I don't have
time to see you right now.

01:01:55.912 --> 01:01:58.380
I'm, um, about to start
making rounds,

01:01:58.448 --> 01:02:01.349
and I'm examining back-to-back
patients until dinner, and, uh...

01:02:01.417 --> 01:02:03.715
Very well. I'll watch.

01:02:03.786 --> 01:02:06.983
Watch me do what? Make rounds
and examine back-to-back patients.

01:02:07.056 --> 01:02:10.321
Joe, that's impossible.

01:02:10.393 --> 01:02:13.885
I'm a doctor. And I'll be a visitor.

01:02:13.963 --> 01:02:17.831
Patients have visitors,
not doctors. I don't mind.

01:02:17.900 --> 01:02:21.563
<i>Miss? Miss?</i>

01:02:21.637 --> 01:02:25.505
Doctor. Oh, um, just one
second. I'll be right there.

01:02:25.575 --> 01:02:27.839
Please. My mama is sicker than him.

01:02:29.679 --> 01:02:31.613
Okay.

01:02:35.418 --> 01:02:39.047
<i>Obeah.
- No, Mama.</i>

01:02:39.122 --> 01:02:41.556
<i>Obeah, man.</i>

01:02:41.624 --> 01:02:44.593
- I goin' die.
- Mama, stop it. It's just a man.

01:02:44.660 --> 01:02:47.595
<i>What's Obeah? Bad spirit.
She just all fever.</i>

01:02:47.663 --> 01:02:50.598
She don't mean nothing.
Please help us. Of course.

01:02:50.666 --> 01:02:52.930
<i>No Obeah, sister.</i>

01:02:53.002 --> 01:02:55.470
Everything gonna be
all right.

01:03:01.477 --> 01:03:04.071
Have you registered?
No.

01:03:04.147 --> 01:03:06.581
Okay.

01:03:14.557 --> 01:03:18.288
You gonna be all right? Go with the
doctor lady. Mama gonna be fine now.

01:03:18.361 --> 01:03:20.921
Don't leave.
Don't leave me.

01:03:20.997 --> 01:03:24.455
She'll be right back, okay? Mama.

01:03:33.176 --> 01:03:36.839
- Obeah.
- Rahtid.

01:03:36.913 --> 01:03:39.473
Obeah evil.
I not evil, woman.

01:03:39.549 --> 01:03:41.983
And what you is then?

01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:47.250
I from that next place.

01:03:47.323 --> 01:03:50.486
You waitin' here
to take us?

01:03:50.560 --> 01:03:53.028
Like you is
the bus driver to there?

01:03:53.095 --> 01:03:55.996
No, man,
I on 'oliday.

01:03:57.934 --> 01:04:00.960
Some spot you pick.

01:04:03.940 --> 01:04:06.875
Oh. Mmm.

01:04:06.943 --> 01:04:10.435
The pain.
Pain is bad, bad.

01:04:10.513 --> 01:04:14.449
I don't have nothin' to do
with these things, you know.

01:04:14.517 --> 01:04:18.146
Make it go away. Doctor
lady make it all right.

01:04:18.221 --> 01:04:22.055
Uh-uh.
Not this pain.

01:04:22.124 --> 01:04:25.821
This pain go
through and through me.

01:04:25.895 --> 01:04:28.227
Make it go away.
I can't, sister.

01:04:28.297 --> 01:04:31.824
You can, mister.

01:04:31.901 --> 01:04:33.835
Take me to
that next place.

01:04:33.903 --> 01:04:37.066
It's not your time now.
Make it time.

01:04:37.139 --> 01:04:39.505
You can't fool with the
way things got to be.

01:04:39.575 --> 01:04:43.341
Please?

01:04:48.084 --> 01:04:50.814
Where she was born.

01:04:53.556 --> 01:04:56.719
Close your eyes.

01:04:56.792 --> 01:04:58.726
Go on, sister.

01:05:31.027 --> 01:05:33.257
Soon.

01:05:37.266 --> 01:05:39.632
You... You can go with her.
I'll be right there.

01:05:39.702 --> 01:05:41.761
Come now, Mama.

01:05:47.410 --> 01:05:51.210
She's in a great deal of pain. Yes.

01:05:54.250 --> 01:05:59.051
Have you spent much time
in the islands? Some.

01:06:02.091 --> 01:06:05.492
I realize now
my being here,

01:06:05.561 --> 01:06:07.995
uh, is not
quite appropriate.

01:06:08.064 --> 01:06:11.898
Oh, no, please...
Please don't apologize.

01:06:13.002 --> 01:06:16.199
Yes?
Yeah.

01:06:20.042 --> 01:06:22.408
I'm glad that you came.

01:06:22.478 --> 01:06:27.074
Thank you, Susan. I'm
very happy to be here.

01:06:29.452 --> 01:06:33.115
Joe, I'm with Drew.

01:06:34.423 --> 01:06:36.914
Not now.

01:06:40.629 --> 01:06:44.326
I have to go.

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:48.598
I'm sorry to say.
Be sorry for nothing.

01:06:50.740 --> 01:06:54.141
Right.

01:06:54.210 --> 01:06:58.374
Thanks, Joe.
Good-bye, Susan.

01:07:10.259 --> 01:07:14.525
- Good?
- Mmm.

01:07:14.597 --> 01:07:19.398
- Yes, what is it?
- Cold lamb sandwich with cilantro.

01:07:19.468 --> 01:07:22.198
A little Coleman's mustard.

01:07:23.806 --> 01:07:26.366
It's, uh, splendid.

01:07:26.442 --> 01:07:29.104
Glad you like it.

01:07:31.480 --> 01:07:36.042
My wife turned me on
to cold lamb sandwiches.

01:07:37.753 --> 01:07:42.315
- Joan... was my wife.
- Mm-hmm.

01:07:54.770 --> 01:07:58.729
Yeah.
Cold lamb sandwiches.

01:07:58.808 --> 01:08:03.507
Not as chewy as roast beef,
not as boring as chicken.

01:08:03.579 --> 01:08:07.777
<i>She knew stuff like that.</i>

01:08:10.686 --> 01:08:13.314
Everything reminds me
of her.

01:08:13.389 --> 01:08:18.053
There isn't a day goes by
that I don't think about her.

01:08:18.127 --> 01:08:23.029
One day she didn't feel well.
The next day she was gone.

01:08:27.368 --> 01:08:29.734
So what
are you gonna do?

01:08:29.805 --> 01:08:33.399
Yeah.

01:08:33.475 --> 01:08:37.037
I guess you've heard all this
a trillion times before, huh?

01:08:38.180 --> 01:08:41.979
- More.
- Why didn't you stop me?

01:08:42.051 --> 01:08:44.542
I don't know.

01:08:47.823 --> 01:08:50.656
What was it like
when you first met?

01:08:51.926 --> 01:08:54.555
I thought you'd heard it
a trillion times before.

01:08:54.630 --> 01:08:57.861
This part
I'm interested in.

01:09:04.106 --> 01:09:07.564
Well, she had on
this little blue suit...

01:09:11.546 --> 01:09:15.984
With a little white collar
that had a little...

01:09:16.051 --> 01:09:19.179
red piping on it.

01:09:22.591 --> 01:09:24.821
<i>Yeah?</i>

01:09:27.029 --> 01:09:29.429
Hi.

01:09:30.566 --> 01:09:33.535
- Am I interrupting?
- Yes.

01:09:34.904 --> 01:09:37.600
- No.
- Just kidding?

01:09:37.673 --> 01:09:41.040
<i>Sit down, Drew.</i>

01:09:41.109 --> 01:09:45.638
Uh, before I do, I was hoping
we might be alone, Bill.

01:09:45.714 --> 01:09:48.877
Well, Joe and I have
no secrets from each other.

01:09:48.951 --> 01:09:50.885
<i>How nice for you both.</i>

01:09:54.523 --> 01:09:59.051
Pardon my candor, but I was confounded
by your decision this morning.

01:09:59.128 --> 01:10:01.153
Why?
I was hired.

01:10:01.230 --> 01:10:05.166
You told me to help bring Parrish
Communications into the 21st century.

01:10:05.234 --> 01:10:07.998
<i>This merger is the vehicle. In my
estimation... Perhaps a merger is a way...</i>

01:10:08.070 --> 01:10:11.369
to bring Bill's company into the
21st century, and perhaps it isn't.

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:14.534
And perhaps cheating on your French
philosophers exam at the Groton School...

01:10:14.610 --> 01:10:18.239
was an expedient way to get your
diploma, and perhaps it wasn't.

01:10:18.314 --> 01:10:23.809
<i>Be that as it may, Drew, a question
can often be argued both ways.</i>

01:10:23.886 --> 01:10:26.480
Joe, cut it out.
You too, Drew.

01:10:29.358 --> 01:10:33.454
- I thought this was practically a done deal.
- Well, now it's undone, okay?

01:10:33.529 --> 01:10:36.657
Forget Bontecou.
Scrub him.

01:10:36.732 --> 01:10:40.224
I'm tired of his fancy name
and his fancy offer.

01:10:40.302 --> 01:10:43.567
I'm not going for it.

01:10:43.639 --> 01:10:46.335
Okay.

01:10:55.184 --> 01:10:58.210
<i>Bill,
why at this juncture...</i>

01:10:58.287 --> 01:11:02.656
are you letting yourself be so
concerned by business matters?

01:11:02.725 --> 01:11:06.593
'Cause I don't want anybody
buying up my life's work!

01:11:06.662 --> 01:11:09.495
Turning it into something
it wasn't meant to be.

01:11:09.565 --> 01:11:14.025
A man wants to leave something behind. He
wants it left behind the way he made it.

01:11:14.103 --> 01:11:16.128
He wants it to be run
the way he ran it,

01:11:16.205 --> 01:11:18.730
with a sense of honor,
of dedication, of truth.

01:11:18.807 --> 01:11:21.435
Easy, Bill. You'll give
yourself a heart attack...

01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:24.604
and ruin my vacation.

01:11:42.197 --> 01:11:44.256
Now listen.

01:11:44.333 --> 01:11:46.801
I read you all the way
on the Bontecou thing,

01:11:46.869 --> 01:11:50.805
and I know where you're coming
from, and I am with you 101 percent.

01:11:50.873 --> 01:11:53.740
Well, thank you,
Quince.

01:11:56.278 --> 01:11:58.439
But I just gotta
tell you,

01:11:58.514 --> 01:12:01.005
if mergers are
in the wind,

01:12:01.083 --> 01:12:04.746
I've developed
some great prospects.

01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:07.653
And I want to come and talk to
you about... about 'em next week.

01:12:07.723 --> 01:12:09.953
Next week?
Yeah.

01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:14.323
Or the week after.

01:12:15.931 --> 01:12:19.162
No good? No. Why, anything's possible.

01:12:19.234 --> 01:12:22.670
It's up to Joe.
Joe.

01:12:22.738 --> 01:12:25.605
You just don't know how
glad I am you're aboard,

01:12:25.674 --> 01:12:28.268
because anybody who can take some
of the weight off the old man,

01:12:28.344 --> 01:12:31.677
I am...
I'm in his corner.

01:12:31.747 --> 01:12:36.116
That's very gracious of you,
Quince. Ah, it's no problem.

01:12:36.185 --> 01:12:40.121
Well, I'll leave you two
alone, because I can, uh...

01:12:40.189 --> 01:12:42.657
I can tell, you know...

01:12:42.725 --> 01:12:44.818
you got something
in the fire.

01:12:50.466 --> 01:12:52.730
Now, look,
I know you're down.

01:12:52.801 --> 01:12:57.204
But you know, when you're down,
there's no place to go but up.

01:12:57.272 --> 01:12:59.570
Up.
Thanks, Quince.

01:12:59.641 --> 01:13:01.609
Forget about Bontecou.

01:13:01.677 --> 01:13:04.111
I got a couple other merger
possibilities up my sleeve,

01:13:04.179 --> 01:13:06.374
and I'm pitching 'em
to the old man.

01:13:06.448 --> 01:13:08.416
Were you?
Yeah.

01:13:08.484 --> 01:13:11.681
Hey, listen.
Mm-hmm.

01:13:11.754 --> 01:13:15.155
We're gonna go in
together. I'll clue you in.

01:13:15.224 --> 01:13:18.660
The timing has gotta
be right,

01:13:18.727 --> 01:13:21.491
because the old man
says it's up to Joe.

01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.934
He said it's up to Joe? Mm-hmm.

01:13:27.002 --> 01:13:29.766
Those were his words?
Yeah.

01:13:29.838 --> 01:13:31.806
It's up to Joe, huh?
Yeah.

01:13:31.874 --> 01:13:35.503
That's what he said? That's
what he... That's what he said.

01:13:35.577 --> 01:13:38.546
That's very interesting.

01:13:38.614 --> 01:13:41.708
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
I thought so too.

01:13:49.458 --> 01:13:53.121
I want to thank you all
for coming.

01:13:53.195 --> 01:13:56.358
Uh, my family, um,
Allison and Quince,

01:13:56.432 --> 01:13:58.730
Susan and
the other members.

01:14:02.004 --> 01:14:04.097
And, uh...

01:14:05.174 --> 01:14:07.734
So glad when we
can get together.

01:14:07.810 --> 01:14:11.473
I mean, I know
you all have busy lives.

01:14:11.547 --> 01:14:14.141
- Look who's talking.
- Yeah. Speak for yourself.

01:14:14.216 --> 01:14:16.684
Yeah.

01:14:16.752 --> 01:14:21.451
I remember when you were
little girls, and, uh...

01:14:21.523 --> 01:14:24.253
I love little girls.

01:14:26.361 --> 01:14:31.196
And uh, now you're all
grown up, and I, um...

01:14:31.266 --> 01:14:34.429
I had some words prepared,
but, uh,

01:14:34.503 --> 01:14:36.437
I've forgotten them.

01:14:36.505 --> 01:14:39.941
Um...
Wait a minute, uh...

01:14:43.712 --> 01:14:46.306
<i>There's so much I wanted
to say, uh... Daddy?</i>

01:14:46.381 --> 01:14:50.943
- You could sit down if you want to.
- Yeah.

01:14:51.019 --> 01:14:53.920
So many words I wanted to...

01:14:53.989 --> 01:14:56.457
So much I wanted to say,
but, uh...

01:14:58.861 --> 01:15:01.557
I can't, and so, uh...

01:15:01.630 --> 01:15:04.565
Yeah, I better sit down.

01:15:06.435 --> 01:15:09.734
Carry on, everybody, please.
Oh, one other thing.

01:15:11.306 --> 01:15:14.571
Um, why don't we all...

01:15:14.643 --> 01:15:17.612
have dinner again
tomorrow night, okay?

01:15:17.679 --> 01:15:19.647
Dinner again?
Yeah.

01:15:19.715 --> 01:15:22.548
You haven't had
enough of us yet, Dad?

01:15:24.253 --> 01:15:26.847
Mmm...

01:15:26.922 --> 01:15:30.016
<i>mmm...</i>

01:15:30.092 --> 01:15:32.026
no.

01:15:35.297 --> 01:15:38.027
<i>Come here.</i>

01:15:39.735 --> 01:15:42.329
- We'll be here.
- You bet we'll be here.

01:15:42.404 --> 01:15:44.497
Bright-eyed
and bushy-tailed.

01:15:47.809 --> 01:15:49.743
Joe.

01:15:58.153 --> 01:16:00.451
Oh, no.

01:16:00.522 --> 01:16:03.958
I would prefer
some peanut butter.

01:16:04.026 --> 01:16:08.759
How would you like that, sir?
On some kind of toast? Toast.

01:16:09.865 --> 01:16:13.767
No, just the butter.
Right away, sir.

01:16:15.170 --> 01:16:17.934
Why do you like
peanut butter so much?

01:16:18.006 --> 01:16:19.974
I don't know.

01:16:20.042 --> 01:16:22.806
Hmm. I adore
things like that.

01:16:22.878 --> 01:16:26.041
Food I can't do without.
Don't you?

01:16:26.114 --> 01:16:28.048
Yes.

01:16:28.116 --> 01:16:30.949
It comforts you, doesn't
it? Yes, I find that it does.

01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:34.545
<i>Mind if I throw up?
Drew.</i>

01:16:34.623 --> 01:16:36.853
Please.

01:16:41.563 --> 01:16:45.090
I'm very concerned about the
woman you attended to today.

01:16:45.167 --> 01:16:48.603
<i>- I am too.
- Has her pain abated?</i>

01:16:48.670 --> 01:16:52.106
<i>We're doing what we can
for her, but, uh,</i>

01:16:52.174 --> 01:16:54.608
it's not looking very good.

01:16:54.676 --> 01:16:57.201
I'm sorry to hear that.
Yeah.

01:16:57.279 --> 01:16:59.406
Who are we talking about?

01:16:59.481 --> 01:17:02.712
But I know she's grateful
for the care you're giving her.

01:17:02.784 --> 01:17:05.150
Is this a state secret?

01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:08.678
<i>No, we're talking about a
patient of mine, 'cause... Uh-huh.</i>

01:17:08.757 --> 01:17:11.123
Joe stopped by
the hospital today.

01:17:11.193 --> 01:17:15.095
<i>He did? That's more than we get to do.</i>

01:17:15.163 --> 01:17:18.132
Maybe next time you go to the
hospital, you'll take us along with you.

01:17:18.200 --> 01:17:20.600
- Perhaps you could remind me.
- Well, I'll make a note of it.

01:17:20.669 --> 01:17:23.467
<i>- Anything else I can do for you?
- I wanna come along too.</i>

01:17:23.538 --> 01:17:25.802
<i>See Susie strut her stuff.
You're on, Quincie.</i>

01:17:25.874 --> 01:17:30.743
Destination, hospital. Joe,
you can be the tour guide, okay?

01:17:33.815 --> 01:17:36.648
Susan's a wonderful doctor.

01:17:36.718 --> 01:17:39.278
I'm sure she is.

01:17:43.458 --> 01:17:45.392
Bill?
Yeah?

01:17:45.460 --> 01:17:47.394
I have to go. It's been a hell of a day.

01:17:47.462 --> 01:17:50.556
I need a few minutes to sort
everything out. See you tomorrow.

01:17:56.438 --> 01:17:58.372
Joe?

01:18:02.044 --> 01:18:04.342
Yes, Bill?

01:18:04.413 --> 01:18:06.813
Um...

01:18:13.221 --> 01:18:16.713
Why'd you go to the
hospital? I don't know.

01:18:16.792 --> 01:18:20.353
<i>You just curious?
I guess.</i>

01:18:20.429 --> 01:18:23.262
<i>About Susan?</i>

01:18:23.331 --> 01:18:26.664
I wouldn't put it that
way. How would you put it?

01:18:29.037 --> 01:18:32.871
You tell me, Bill. No,
how about you telling me?

01:18:32.941 --> 01:18:35.466
I ask a simple question;
I expect a straight answer.

01:18:35.544 --> 01:18:38.513
That's what I'm used to. Anybody
who doesn't give it to me, I fire.

01:18:39.815 --> 01:18:42.409
Are you going
to fire me, Bill?

01:18:46.121 --> 01:18:48.089
Drew?

01:18:49.157 --> 01:18:51.887
So, uh, I'll see you
tomorrow night?

01:18:51.960 --> 01:18:56.090
You include me out. I've had
enough of the convocations.

01:18:56.164 --> 01:19:00.533
You don't mean that. You
don't want to disappoint Dad.

01:19:00.602 --> 01:19:05.062
Daddy will do fine. Besides, he's
got Joe. And it seems you do too.

01:19:05.140 --> 01:19:08.576
You're out of line. Well, that may be,
but I don't like the ubiquitous creep.

01:19:08.643 --> 01:19:12.135
I don't like the way he looks at you.
I don't like the way he talks to you.

01:19:13.248 --> 01:19:15.580
And vice versa.

01:19:19.321 --> 01:19:21.755
I'm sorry.

01:19:24.059 --> 01:19:27.961
'Cause I like the way
he looks and talks to me.

01:19:28.029 --> 01:19:30.463
And vice versa.

01:19:32.968 --> 01:19:35.061
Okay?

01:19:36.471 --> 01:19:38.405
Not okay.

01:19:39.941 --> 01:19:42.501
Thought we had
a good thing going here.

01:19:42.577 --> 01:19:45.478
I thought
it was a good thing.

01:19:46.715 --> 01:19:49.548
Well, that just goes to show
you never know.

01:19:52.788 --> 01:19:54.881
Night.

01:19:54.956 --> 01:19:57.948
<i>Good night.</i>

01:20:17.979 --> 01:20:20.914
How long have you
been standing there?

01:20:23.185 --> 01:20:26.279
I don't like the way
he spoke to you.

01:20:26.354 --> 01:20:29.448
But I feel better now because
of the way you spoke back.

01:20:33.094 --> 01:20:36.791
Tell me
about yourself, Joe.

01:20:36.865 --> 01:20:38.799
I mean, who are you?

01:20:38.867 --> 01:20:42.997
What are you doing here
with my father?

01:20:47.542 --> 01:20:49.510
You're not
going to tell me?

01:21:00.222 --> 01:21:02.782
You're married,
aren't you?

01:21:02.858 --> 01:21:06.055
Why?

01:21:06.127 --> 01:21:10.928
Because men who never say anything
about themselves, they're...

01:21:10.999 --> 01:21:13.627
they're always married.

01:21:20.075 --> 01:21:24.034
So you're married?
No, I'm not.

01:21:25.914 --> 01:21:29.281
But you...
you have a girlfriend.

01:21:29.351 --> 01:21:32.548
No.

01:21:34.289 --> 01:21:37.986
Gay?
No.

01:21:45.533 --> 01:21:48.366
So, tell me, Joe...

01:21:50.639 --> 01:21:54.905
How come a man as
attractive, intelligent,

01:21:54.976 --> 01:21:58.912
well-spoken...

01:22:02.017 --> 01:22:06.920
diffident in the most
seductive way, and yet...

01:22:09.858 --> 01:22:12.622
powerful...

01:22:15.797 --> 01:22:18.698
is all alone
in this world?

01:22:32.347 --> 01:22:34.838
I'm sorry.

01:22:36.318 --> 01:22:38.843
I'm s...
I didn't...

01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:43.152
mean to pry, and, uh,

01:22:43.224 --> 01:22:46.591
you obviously don't
want to tell me,

01:22:46.661 --> 01:22:49.391
so we'll just...

01:22:51.466 --> 01:22:54.264
We'll just
leave it a mystery.

01:22:59.140 --> 01:23:03.076
That is the way you want
it, isn't it? Yes, thank you.

01:23:15.890 --> 01:23:18.757
Where are you going?

01:23:18.827 --> 01:23:21.057
To bed.

01:23:21.129 --> 01:23:24.223
- To bed?
- Yes.

01:23:24.299 --> 01:23:26.790
I'm tired.

01:23:32.507 --> 01:23:34.975
<i>- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night. Sleep well.</i>

01:23:35.043 --> 01:23:38.410
Okay. See you tomorrow.
Good night. See you.

01:23:38.480 --> 01:23:40.414
Good night, Susie. Get
some sleep. Good night.

01:23:40.482 --> 01:23:42.416
Yeah.
See you tomorrow.

01:23:42.484 --> 01:23:44.577
Good night.
Good night.

01:23:48.289 --> 01:23:51.224
That was wonderful.
Mmm.

01:23:51.292 --> 01:23:54.261
It's good to get together. Mm-hmm.

01:24:00.068 --> 01:24:03.196
Do you mind if I raise
a little caution flag?

01:24:03.271 --> 01:24:06.468
Raise away.

01:24:06.541 --> 01:24:10.341
What is the nature
of your interest in Joe?

01:24:11.880 --> 01:24:14.747
Well...

01:24:14.816 --> 01:24:18.274
Remember how you told me
about lightning striking?

01:24:18.353 --> 01:24:20.480
Mm-hmm.

01:24:20.555 --> 01:24:24.616
The nature of it's
in there somewhere.

01:24:24.692 --> 01:24:28.594
Yeah. Well, I won't say you're
on the wrong track, but, uh...

01:24:28.663 --> 01:24:31.097
Then what
will you say?

01:24:35.370 --> 01:24:39.363
I don't think this is the
lightning you're looking for.

01:24:39.441 --> 01:24:44.310
I mean, Drew is a good man. I know I didn't
seem to be completely in his corner before,

01:24:44.379 --> 01:24:46.973
but, uh, I've come
to appreciate that, um...

01:24:47.048 --> 01:24:50.711
Now we love Drew?
And Joe doesn't measure up?

01:24:50.785 --> 01:24:55.484
What's going on?
Nothing.

01:24:55.557 --> 01:24:58.549
When you say "nothing"
that way, it is not nothing.

01:24:58.626 --> 01:25:00.958
Then what is it?
It's something.

01:25:05.767 --> 01:25:09.134
Okay.
Good night.

01:25:09.204 --> 01:25:13.072
I'll see you tomorrow. Yeah. Good night.

01:25:19.414 --> 01:25:22.815
I know you're all as uncomfortable
as I am to be meeting like this.

01:25:22.884 --> 01:25:26.684
But I got a call last night
from John Bontecou.

01:25:26.754 --> 01:25:31.453
Not only is he still interested,
he's sweetening his offer.

01:25:33.528 --> 01:25:36.088
Although it pains me
to say it, in my opinion,

01:25:36.164 --> 01:25:39.998
Bill Parrish dealt with us
pre-emptively...

01:25:40.068 --> 01:25:42.662
in dismissing any deal
with Bontecou.

01:25:42.737 --> 01:25:47.333
Therefore, I'm sorry to say that if we're
to examine this new offer responsibly,

01:25:47.408 --> 01:25:50.502
as the Board of Directors
of Parrish Communications,

01:25:50.578 --> 01:25:55.072
we must do so
without its chairman.

01:25:55.150 --> 01:25:57.618
There's one
additional element.

01:25:57.685 --> 01:26:00.085
Bontecou is so anxious
to get us,

01:26:00.155 --> 01:26:05.525
he said he'd take Parrish Communications
with Bill Parrish or without.

01:26:13.568 --> 01:26:15.627
<i>In this crisis,
and be assured...</i>

01:26:15.703 --> 01:26:19.366
this is a crisis,

01:26:19.440 --> 01:26:21.533
it's not pleasant
to say the following.

01:26:21.609 --> 01:26:24.942
But I would be remiss
if I did not.

01:26:25.013 --> 01:26:28.039
When we present Bill with
the improved Bontecou offer,

01:26:28.116 --> 01:26:30.550
and if he still refuses
to let us consider it,

01:26:30.618 --> 01:26:36.022
once more makes an adamant or emotional
rejection, we will have no choice but to...

01:26:36.090 --> 01:26:38.957
You're taking this
too far, Drew.

01:26:40.528 --> 01:26:42.689
Am I not obligated to?

01:26:48.603 --> 01:26:51.367
See if Quince is here.

01:26:51.439 --> 01:26:54.738
How did all this
come about?

01:26:54.809 --> 01:26:58.609
Crisis, Bill Parrish. Crisis,
his company. Crisis for us.

01:26:58.680 --> 01:27:02.377
It came about with the arrival
on the scene of Mr. Joe Black.

01:27:02.450 --> 01:27:06.580
Mr. Joe who?
Joe Black.

01:27:06.654 --> 01:27:09.555
He attends
our board meetings.

01:27:09.624 --> 01:27:12.821
He sleeps at Bill's house.
He resides in his office.

01:27:12.894 --> 01:27:14.953
He never leaves his side,
and, in my opinion,

01:27:15.029 --> 01:27:17.463
is always in his ear,
telling Bill what to do.

01:27:17.532 --> 01:27:19.727
And Bill is listening.

01:27:19.801 --> 01:27:22.599
Who is Joe Black?

01:27:22.670 --> 01:27:25.161
What... What is his
relationship to Bill Parrish,

01:27:25.240 --> 01:27:29.074
and most important, what is behind
his influence on our chairman?

01:27:29.143 --> 01:27:34.604
<i>He's had advisors before.
Nobody tells Bill what to do.</i>

01:27:38.152 --> 01:27:43.055
Thanks for coming, Quince. Sure. Hi, Ed.

01:27:43.124 --> 01:27:46.890
<i>Hi, folks.</i>

01:27:46.961 --> 01:27:50.021
I didn't know everybody
was going to be here.

01:27:50.098 --> 01:27:53.329
Nice surprise.

01:27:53.401 --> 01:27:55.335
What's with
the new digs?

01:27:55.403 --> 01:27:59.931
<i>Drew's idea of cloak and dagger.
This is a secret meeting, Quince.</i>

01:28:00.008 --> 01:28:03.136
I hope you'll
respect its nature.

01:28:12.353 --> 01:28:14.287
Have a seat, Quince.

01:28:29.170 --> 01:28:32.503
Now, what we're trying
to do here is to, uh...

01:28:32.573 --> 01:28:37.510
to gather our thoughts in light of
Bill's rejection of Bontecou's offer...

01:28:37.578 --> 01:28:39.944
and to make an appropriate
presentation to him...

01:28:40.014 --> 01:28:43.415
as to how we think
the company might proceed.

01:28:43.484 --> 01:28:47.318
Won't you share with our board the
information you gave me last night?

01:28:50.258 --> 01:28:55.355
Well, uh, I'm hap... I'm happy
to tell you I got good news.

01:28:55.430 --> 01:28:58.524
As I was, uh,
as I was telling Drew,

01:28:58.599 --> 01:29:03.332
uh, I've been making a little hay
while the Bontecou sun was shining.

01:29:03.404 --> 01:29:07.363
Two, possibly three, new and
boiling hot prospects for merger.

01:29:07.442 --> 01:29:10.605
Mm-hmm. And how did Bill react
to the leads you've developed?

01:29:10.678 --> 01:29:16.241
He was interested. Yeah, but he
was concerned about the timing?

01:29:16.317 --> 01:29:20.481
Timing? Yeah, he was
concerned about the timing?

01:29:20.555 --> 01:29:24.321
Yes.
He says it's up to Joe.

01:29:27.462 --> 01:29:29.896
It's up to Joe.

01:29:45.446 --> 01:29:48.074
~ Dum-da-dum ~
What's this?

01:29:48.149 --> 01:29:52.813
- Um, Annie made them.
- Who's Annie?

01:29:52.887 --> 01:29:55.720
Thank you, Lillian.
From La Rosette?

01:29:55.790 --> 01:29:59.123
She's only the most famous
pastry chef in America.

01:29:59.193 --> 01:30:02.890
<i>Um, this is orange,
made with real Seville oranges.</i>

01:30:02.964 --> 01:30:06.525
<i>Oh. And, uh, that's lemon
on a mille-feuille crust.</i>

01:30:06.601 --> 01:30:09.900
I don't like cake.

01:30:09.971 --> 01:30:12.701
It's for the party, Dad.

01:30:12.774 --> 01:30:16.232
Ah.
The goddamn party.

01:30:16.310 --> 01:30:19.404
The goddamn party.
Mm-hmm.

01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:22.005
<i>Did you hear that?
I'm sorry.</i>

01:30:23.317 --> 01:30:26.411
<i>The goddamn party.
Oh.</i>

01:30:26.487 --> 01:30:29.183
<i>Come on, l...
Here, let's try this one...</i>

01:30:29.257 --> 01:30:32.090
<i>right over here.</i>

01:30:34.729 --> 01:30:37.596
Mmm.

01:30:37.665 --> 01:30:42.159
This, this is terrific.
It has, um,

01:30:42.236 --> 01:30:44.602
has vodka in it, Bill.

01:30:44.672 --> 01:30:46.697
A little vodka, right?

01:30:46.774 --> 01:30:48.765
Has, um, that fruity vodka,
that flavored stuff, right?

01:30:48.843 --> 01:30:52.609
Bill, put your lips around this.
It's just out of this world.

01:30:52.680 --> 01:30:56.741
<i>I'm sorry, honey. You
know, I'm no good at this.</i>

01:30:56.818 --> 01:30:58.752
Why don't you choose
whichever cake you'd like?

01:30:58.820 --> 01:31:01.880
<i>Hmm? I knew you were gonna say that.</i>

01:31:01.956 --> 01:31:04.447
<i>What? I mean you just don't care.</i>

01:31:04.525 --> 01:31:08.222
Oh, why am I doing this? I should
have my head examined again.

01:31:08.296 --> 01:31:13.427
<i>Oh, my God. I am trying to
throw the party of the century...</i>

01:31:13.501 --> 01:31:16.231
For my father in two days.

01:31:16.304 --> 01:31:18.272
And you just don't give
a shit. He gives a shit.

01:31:18.339 --> 01:31:21.240
<i>He doesn't give a shit! He does.</i>

01:31:21.309 --> 01:31:24.005
<i>Allison. He does give
a shit. Don't you, Bill?</i>

01:31:25.613 --> 01:31:28.639
Come on. Come on.

01:31:31.252 --> 01:31:33.982
<i>Come on. Smile. I'm sorry.</i>

01:31:38.726 --> 01:31:41.320
But what should we
tell Annie?

01:31:43.197 --> 01:31:45.131
~ Bum-bum-bum ~

01:31:47.235 --> 01:31:51.194
This one.
Mmm.

01:31:51.272 --> 01:31:54.833
<i>He gives a shit!</i>

01:31:57.445 --> 01:32:00.039
Fantastic.

01:32:01.549 --> 01:32:03.483
Thank you.

01:32:10.725 --> 01:32:13.592
<i>Um, Mr. Black, would you
care for a piece?</i>

01:32:13.661 --> 01:32:16.129
Yes, I'd love one.

01:32:22.470 --> 01:32:24.495
Have you had a chance
to, uh,

01:32:24.572 --> 01:32:28.440
look at my father's
rare books?

01:32:28.509 --> 01:32:33.537
He has Jefferson's
parliamentary manual, and, uh,

01:32:33.614 --> 01:32:36.082
<i>this first edition
of Bleak House.</i>

01:32:36.150 --> 01:32:38.914
I love your smell.

01:32:44.292 --> 01:32:47.523
Well, I like
the way you smell too.

01:32:55.703 --> 01:32:59.867
My mom always used to say that you
could set your heart by that clock.

01:33:06.113 --> 01:33:09.207
Could you?

01:33:09.283 --> 01:33:11.717
I never tried.

01:33:14.488 --> 01:33:17.548
Till now.

01:33:22.229 --> 01:33:24.789
Joe?
Hmm?

01:33:28.202 --> 01:33:30.966
May I kiss you?

01:33:31.038 --> 01:33:34.030
Why, yes, you can.

01:33:58.899 --> 01:34:01.333
Mmm.

01:34:40.975 --> 01:34:43.341
Thank you.

01:34:45.212 --> 01:34:48.010
You're welcome.

01:34:52.420 --> 01:34:56.948
Joe?
Mmm.

01:34:57.024 --> 01:35:00.516
I don't know
who you are.

01:35:04.265 --> 01:35:07.291
I'm Joe.
Mm-hmm.

01:35:07.368 --> 01:35:11.202
And, uh,
you're Susan.

01:35:11.272 --> 01:35:14.036
Mmm.

01:35:14.108 --> 01:35:17.475
And...
I have this...

01:35:17.545 --> 01:35:20.013
weak feeling
in my knees.

01:35:20.081 --> 01:35:23.482
And is your heart
beating strangely? Yes.

01:35:23.551 --> 01:35:25.542
Mm-hmm.
Faster.

01:35:26.921 --> 01:35:29.822
The taste of your lips and
the touch of your tongue...

01:35:29.890 --> 01:35:32.017
that was wonderful.

01:35:33.094 --> 01:35:35.028
Mmm.

01:35:39.867 --> 01:35:41.801
I should, um...

01:35:42.870 --> 01:35:44.804
I should go home.

01:35:44.872 --> 01:35:47.841
Mmm.

01:35:47.908 --> 01:35:50.399
Shouldn't I?

01:35:52.780 --> 01:35:55.180
Yeah.

01:36:20.141 --> 01:36:23.941
Good night, Dad.
Good night.

01:36:28.883 --> 01:36:31.647
Hello, Bill.

01:36:34.121 --> 01:36:37.386
Hello.

01:36:40.694 --> 01:36:44.357
Would you like to join me and
Allison and Quince for a nightcap?

01:36:45.533 --> 01:36:49.867
No. Not right now.

01:36:53.974 --> 01:36:56.272
Okay.

01:36:58.946 --> 01:37:00.914
Then I'll say
good night.

01:37:00.981 --> 01:37:02.915
Good night, Bill.

01:37:12.960 --> 01:37:15.394
<i>Morning, Quince.
Top of the morning, B.P.</i>

01:37:15.462 --> 01:37:18.022
Hello, Quince.
Hey!

01:37:20.734 --> 01:37:23.726
Hello, Jennifer. Good
morning, Mr. Parrish.

01:37:23.804 --> 01:37:26.068
The board is waiting. What?

01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:28.938
The board? Didn't you
call a board meeting?

01:37:29.009 --> 01:37:30.636
No.

01:37:42.489 --> 01:37:45.287
- Good morning.
- Morning, Bill.

01:37:45.359 --> 01:37:48.624
Did you want to have a cup
of coffee or something, Bill?

01:37:51.232 --> 01:37:55.225
I don't think so.
Do you?

01:37:55.302 --> 01:38:00.399
To get to the point, we've received
new information from John Bontecou...

01:38:00.474 --> 01:38:03.238
concerning his desires for
this company to merge with his.

01:38:03.310 --> 01:38:05.972
<i>And we wanted to set
the details before you.</i>

01:38:06.046 --> 01:38:08.981
<i>Is that it? Bontecou wants
a quick response, and...</i>

01:38:09.049 --> 01:38:11.950
The answer is no. Quick enough for you?

01:38:12.019 --> 01:38:14.419
<i>- Don't you want to hear the details?
- I'm not interested.</i>

01:38:14.488 --> 01:38:17.753
<i>I'm not interested in the big picture
either. What I am interested in...</i>

01:38:17.825 --> 01:38:20.385
is how my board got convened
behind my back...

01:38:20.461 --> 01:38:25.694
<i>and is entertaining a further proposal from
a man with whom it offends me to do business.</i>

01:38:25.766 --> 01:38:29.361
I made a decision.
Case closed.

01:38:29.436 --> 01:38:32.337
So am I to understand
from your response...

01:38:32.406 --> 01:38:35.204
that you do not want to hear
the details of Bontecou's offer?

01:38:35.276 --> 01:38:37.210
Yes, you are
to understand that.

01:38:37.278 --> 01:38:39.542
And now, may I ask
you a question?

01:38:39.613 --> 01:38:43.310
<i>- Certainly, Bill.
- Are you running this board, or am I?</i>

01:38:47.955 --> 01:38:49.889
That's it?

01:38:51.859 --> 01:38:54.885
We've got a busy day ahead. This
meeting's already set me behind.

01:38:54.962 --> 01:38:59.023
Shall we adjourn? Uh, before
we do, Bill, while we're here...

01:38:59.099 --> 01:39:01.624
There's a second question the
board would like a response to.

01:39:01.702 --> 01:39:05.502
Far simpler one.

01:39:05.572 --> 01:39:08.405
Who is the man
standing to your left?

01:39:11.512 --> 01:39:14.276
I've already introduced
Mr. Black to you all.

01:39:14.348 --> 01:39:17.249
<i>But who is he?
What are his credentials?</i>

01:39:17.318 --> 01:39:19.912
What is his relationship
to you?

01:39:26.493 --> 01:39:29.462
The board
is deeply concerned.

01:39:29.530 --> 01:39:32.988
We have reason to believe Mr. Black is
not only influencing your decisions...

01:39:33.067 --> 01:39:35.160
in regard to this company,

01:39:35.235 --> 01:39:38.796
but that you are relying
on him to make them for you.

01:39:43.077 --> 01:39:45.910
The lack of response, Bill,
is not appropriate.

01:39:45.980 --> 01:39:48.471
We are your board.

01:39:48.549 --> 01:39:51.916
We have a right to know how you are
managing the operations of this company.

01:39:51.986 --> 01:39:56.650
<i>And, most importantly, that you have
not delegated someone to do it for you.</i>

01:39:56.724 --> 01:39:58.692
<i>Okay?</i>

01:39:59.960 --> 01:40:03.123
One more time.
Who is Joe Black?

01:40:14.341 --> 01:40:17.208
A motion has been brought
before the board...

01:40:17.277 --> 01:40:20.212
to invoke Article 19
of the corporate charter.

01:40:20.280 --> 01:40:22.544
In English, please.

01:40:26.887 --> 01:40:31.620
Mandatory retirement
on our chairman's 65th birthday,

01:40:31.692 --> 01:40:34.490
<i>at which time the chairman
will be named emeritus.</i>

01:40:34.561 --> 01:40:37.553
<i>You're welcome to attend
all meetings...</i>

01:40:37.631 --> 01:40:40.623
<i>and will serve as international
spokesman for the corporation.</i>

01:40:40.701 --> 01:40:43.033
Plus, of course,
a settlement,

01:40:43.103 --> 01:40:46.869
a golden parachute of such magnitude
that his feet will never touch the ground.

01:40:48.942 --> 01:40:52.434
Please indicate your vote
by a yes or no.

01:40:52.513 --> 01:40:55.710
- Yes. -
Yes. - Yes.

01:40:55.783 --> 01:40:58.877
Yes.

01:41:02.222 --> 01:41:06.249
- No.
- No.

01:41:07.895 --> 01:41:10.363
Motion's passed.

01:41:14.234 --> 01:41:17.670
We will, of course, delay the announcement
out of respect for our former chairman...

01:41:17.738 --> 01:41:22.437
<i>until after the celebration
of his birthday this weekend.</i>

01:41:22.509 --> 01:41:26.138
Well, thanks for allowing me
to save face, Drew.

01:41:26.213 --> 01:41:29.114
<i>The other motion before us is the
acceptance of John Bontecou's offer...</i>

01:41:29.183 --> 01:41:33.313
to merge this corporation
with Bontecou International.

01:41:49.403 --> 01:41:52.600
Okay.
Joe?

01:42:03.350 --> 01:42:05.511
Who I am...

01:42:05.586 --> 01:42:09.545
and what my relationship is
to William Parrish...

01:42:09.623 --> 01:42:12.888
will be divulged
in our own good time.

01:42:14.094 --> 01:42:18.497
Okay.
Thank you, Mr. Black.

01:42:23.170 --> 01:42:25.229
It's not over
till it's over.

01:42:25.305 --> 01:42:27.603
Please, Eddie,
no "fat lady sings" stuff.

01:42:27.674 --> 01:42:32.043
I still sense some doubt in this
group. We could turn it around.

01:42:32.112 --> 01:42:34.137
You'll be up in the country? Yeah.

01:42:34.214 --> 01:42:37.308
The big celebration of my
mandatory retirement birthday.

01:42:37.384 --> 01:42:39.318
<i>You're an honored guest,
Eddie.</i>

01:42:39.386 --> 01:42:42.583
I'm gonna stick it out
here. We still have a shot.

01:42:42.656 --> 01:42:46.251
Get John's office on the phone. Tell
them I'll be there in 20 minutes.

01:42:48.195 --> 01:42:50.527
What did you do?

01:42:50.597 --> 01:42:53.862
You've gotten the old
man fired. That we did.

01:42:53.934 --> 01:42:56.368
Thanks to you.

01:42:56.436 --> 01:42:59.667
<i>He was wobbling, mind you, but
you supplied the coup de grace.</i>

01:42:59.740 --> 01:43:02.208
I'm gonna put
a stop to this.

01:43:02.276 --> 01:43:05.473
Quince, you can't
unscramble scrambled eggs.

01:43:05.546 --> 01:43:08.515
I-I didn't mean
to do this.

01:43:08.582 --> 01:43:11.312
Train's left the station, pal,
and you're aboard.

01:43:12.619 --> 01:43:15.611
Now, would you like to hear
the silver lining?

01:43:15.689 --> 01:43:18.317
Check that. Gold.

01:43:21.028 --> 01:43:24.191
Once John Bontecou acquires
Parrish Communications,

01:43:24.264 --> 01:43:29.133
he's gonna break it apart, peddle it
piece by piece to the highest bidder.

01:43:30.304 --> 01:43:32.864
That was the game plan
right from the start.

01:43:32.940 --> 01:43:35.340
I set it up for him, and he
smacks it out of the park.

01:43:35.409 --> 01:43:38.742
Ramifications
for you?

01:43:38.812 --> 01:43:41.838
You'll be farting
through silk.

01:43:41.915 --> 01:43:47.012
You'll sell your stock. You'll
be positively, truly rich.

01:43:47.087 --> 01:43:50.318
You can stop
kissing ass.

01:43:50.390 --> 01:43:53.154
What'll it feel like
to be a man?

01:43:55.229 --> 01:43:59.928
I'm going
to expose you.

01:44:00.000 --> 01:44:02.468
Okay.
Go right ahead.

01:44:02.536 --> 01:44:06.267
You tell William Parrish how you
betrayed him in a secret board meeting.

01:44:06.340 --> 01:44:10.572
Tell Allison how you helped
her father lose his company.

01:44:13.547 --> 01:44:16.675
It's just life,
Quincie.

01:44:16.750 --> 01:44:19.844
Wake up
and smell the thorns.

01:44:54.655 --> 01:44:57.123
You're here.

01:44:57.190 --> 01:44:59.954
I am.

01:45:01.094 --> 01:45:03.961
I, uh...
just dropped by.

01:45:04.031 --> 01:45:09.492
I thought I'd scrounge some
lunch. I was in the neighborhood.

01:45:09.569 --> 01:45:11.628
I'm so glad.

01:45:11.705 --> 01:45:16.733
<i>When I called, they said that you
and Dad had already left the office.</i>

01:45:16.810 --> 01:45:20.007
<i>Mm-hmm.
He's taking a nap.</i>

01:45:20.080 --> 01:45:23.948
Oh. Yeah.

01:45:26.219 --> 01:45:30.986
Well, uh,
he must be tired.

01:45:31.058 --> 01:45:34.084
You know,
this whole Bontecou thing...

01:45:34.161 --> 01:45:36.459
It, um, seems...

01:45:36.530 --> 01:45:41.160
<i>Yes, he's tired.
I believe so.</i>

01:45:41.234 --> 01:45:43.168
Yeah.

01:45:50.243 --> 01:45:52.939
You must
be hungry then.

01:45:55.148 --> 01:45:57.082
No.

01:45:57.150 --> 01:45:59.584
Not anymore.

01:46:01.421 --> 01:46:03.719
Are you?

01:51:23.009 --> 01:51:25.944
<i>I loved making love
to you.</i>

01:51:27.480 --> 01:51:32.577
It was like
making love with someone...

01:51:32.652 --> 01:51:35.917
making love
for the first time.

01:51:38.992 --> 01:51:40.926
Thank you.

01:51:45.131 --> 01:51:48.658
Do you like
making love with me?

01:51:51.771 --> 01:51:54.137
Yes.

01:51:55.208 --> 01:51:58.177
More than
you love peanut butter?

01:51:58.244 --> 01:52:00.303
Yes.

01:52:00.380 --> 01:52:02.871
Much more.

01:52:14.761 --> 01:52:19.027
Where are you going?
Nowhere. I'm here.

01:52:20.166 --> 01:52:22.498
For how long?

01:52:22.569 --> 01:52:25.561
I hope
a long, long time.

01:52:27.507 --> 01:52:29.839
Me too.

01:52:36.983 --> 01:52:39.781
What do
we do now?

01:52:43.289 --> 01:52:45.348
Um...

01:52:47.827 --> 01:52:51.388
it'll come to us.

01:53:21.594 --> 01:53:26.554
Hello, Bill.
Did you have a nice nap?

01:53:28.234 --> 01:53:32.830
- I couldn't sleep.
- I'm sorry to hear that.

01:53:34.407 --> 01:53:36.637
I'll come down.

01:53:39.579 --> 01:53:43.208
<i>What's going on?
Hmm?</i>

01:53:44.284 --> 01:53:46.479
I saw you kiss Susan.

01:53:46.553 --> 01:53:49.078
Yes, I saw you see me.

01:53:49.155 --> 01:53:51.521
You're at the wrong place at the
wrong time with the wrong woman.

01:53:51.591 --> 01:53:54.219
I'll be the judge of
that. I'm her father.

01:53:54.294 --> 01:53:56.990
With all due respect, Bill,
I'm not asking your permission.

01:53:57.063 --> 01:54:01.159
You goddamn well should!

01:54:10.143 --> 01:54:14.705
You walk into my life. You give
me the worst news a guy can get.

01:54:14.781 --> 01:54:17.511
You have me dancing on heads of
pins with my business, my family.

01:54:17.584 --> 01:54:20.109
<i>Now you're spooning with
my daughter? "Spooning"?</i>

01:54:20.186 --> 01:54:23.587
<i>Yes! And stop repeating everything
I say and turning it into a question.</i>

01:54:23.656 --> 01:54:27.649
<i>Spooning, fooling around
and God knows what.</i>

01:54:27.727 --> 01:54:30.252
Oh, you arrive
on the scene...

01:54:30.330 --> 01:54:33.766
Why you picked me
I still don't understand.

01:54:33.833 --> 01:54:36.700
I chose you for your verve,
your excellence...

01:54:36.769 --> 01:54:41.103
and your ability to...
instruct.

01:54:41.174 --> 01:54:44.803
You've lived a first-rate life,
and I find it eminently usable.

01:54:48.348 --> 01:54:50.612
What do you want?

01:54:51.784 --> 01:54:53.718
Huh?

01:54:55.355 --> 01:54:58.518
Everybody wants
something, Joe.

01:54:58.591 --> 01:55:01.560
You've been taking me
from pillar to post here.

01:55:01.628 --> 01:55:04.096
And, uh,

01:55:04.163 --> 01:55:08.429
I thought I knew who you were,
and it wasn't a lot of fun.

01:55:08.501 --> 01:55:11.561
But it was
almost bearable.

01:55:11.638 --> 01:55:15.335
But now I'm getting something
else from you, something very...

01:55:15.408 --> 01:55:17.842
very strange.

01:55:17.911 --> 01:55:20.971
What is it
that you want?

01:55:21.047 --> 01:55:23.880
I'm only living
the Parrish bywords...

01:55:23.950 --> 01:55:26.714
looking for that
"ounce of excitement,"

01:55:26.786 --> 01:55:30.813
that " whisper of a thrill there is
no sense living your life without."

01:55:31.991 --> 01:55:35.017
You know
what I mean, Bill?

01:55:36.596 --> 01:55:40.293
You're violating
the laws of the universe.

01:55:40.366 --> 01:55:44.928
- This universe?
- Any universe that exists or ever existed.

01:55:45.004 --> 01:55:49.998
You may be the pro, Joe,
but I know who you are,

01:55:50.076 --> 01:55:52.544
and you're
all fucked up.

01:55:55.415 --> 01:55:58.873
I don't like your tone, and
I don't like your references.

01:55:58.952 --> 01:56:01.512
And I don't give a shit.

01:56:01.587 --> 01:56:07.082
Perhaps it's time to remind you this is
not simply a dispute with a putative suitor.

01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:11.096
This is me.
So be careful, Bill.

01:56:11.164 --> 01:56:14.691
Cut all that "Bill" crap
out, you son of a bitch.

01:56:14.767 --> 01:56:18.999
I'll say it again.
Be careful, Bill.

01:56:27.213 --> 01:56:30.842
Can I help you? Excuse
me, can I help you?

01:56:30.917 --> 01:56:35.217
Yes. Dr. Parrish,
please.

01:56:35.288 --> 01:56:38.587
<i>She comes on at 6:00.</i>

01:56:38.658 --> 01:56:40.592
Oh.

01:56:49.936 --> 01:56:51.927
Hi.

01:56:54.507 --> 01:56:57.999
<i>Where's Joe?
Joe?</i>

01:56:59.946 --> 01:57:02.676
Joe's not around.

01:57:03.883 --> 01:57:07.478
<i>Do you know where he is? I don't know.</i>

01:57:07.553 --> 01:57:09.544
Oh.

01:57:10.890 --> 01:57:13.723
Why are you
looking for Joe?

01:57:13.793 --> 01:57:17.786
<i>Love. Passion.
Obsession.</i>

01:57:17.864 --> 01:57:21.061
All those things
you told me to wait for.

01:57:21.134 --> 01:57:23.602
They've arrived.
This is crazy.

01:57:26.406 --> 01:57:28.271
Why?

01:57:28.341 --> 01:57:31.469
A man shows up, almost
never leaves your side.

01:57:31.544 --> 01:57:36.140
Well, you clearly trust him,
depend on him.

01:57:36.215 --> 01:57:39.981
So why aren't those things
good enough for me?

01:57:40.053 --> 01:57:42.920
<i>You don't know anything about
Joe. What are you afraid of?</i>

01:57:42.989 --> 01:57:46.550
That I'll fall
head over heels for Joe?

01:57:47.794 --> 01:57:50.854
Well, I have. Just
like you did with Mom.

01:57:50.930 --> 01:57:54.058
Isn't that what you've
always wanted for me?

01:57:54.133 --> 01:57:56.067
Susan...

01:57:58.438 --> 01:58:02.431
I don't think Joe is
gonna be with us long.

01:58:02.508 --> 01:58:05.306
Where is he going?

01:58:05.378 --> 01:58:07.778
I don't know.

01:58:07.847 --> 01:58:10.782
<i>I can't say.
Oh, come on.</i>

01:58:10.850 --> 01:58:15.583
The guy's working with you. You know chapter
and verse about everyone working with you.

01:58:15.655 --> 01:58:18.647
<i>In this case I can't. I...</i>

01:58:18.724 --> 01:58:24.253
I only will tell you that with Joe,
you're on... very, very dangerous ground.

01:58:32.171 --> 01:58:34.139
I love him.

01:58:34.207 --> 01:58:38.507
I don't care if you love
him! I'm telling you!

01:58:49.322 --> 01:58:52.086
Joe's no good for you.

01:58:54.227 --> 01:58:57.321
Of course not, Daddy.

01:58:57.396 --> 01:58:59.330
I'm sorry.

01:59:04.070 --> 01:59:06.834
I love you too.

01:59:37.003 --> 01:59:41.667
Mr. Bad News.
'Bout time you show up.

01:59:45.745 --> 01:59:48.646
Don't be feisty, sister.

01:59:48.714 --> 01:59:51.114
I'm not feisty,
mister.

01:59:51.184 --> 01:59:54.711
You come for me?
That's good news.

01:59:56.589 --> 01:59:59.353
No, I come
to see the doctor.

01:59:59.425 --> 02:00:02.258
Doctor?
Mm-hmm.

02:00:02.328 --> 02:00:05.456
What could be wrong with you? Nothin'.

02:00:07.400 --> 02:00:11.359
Ohh. You come
to see doctor lady?

02:00:11.437 --> 02:00:13.905
Yeah, man.
My doctor lady?

02:00:15.942 --> 02:00:18.433
Mine too, you know.

02:00:20.513 --> 02:00:23.573
You're in love?

02:00:30.089 --> 02:00:33.058
You're loved back?

02:00:39.932 --> 02:00:43.732
She know your real self?

02:00:43.803 --> 02:00:47.136
- She know how she feel.
- Backside!

02:00:47.206 --> 02:00:49.902
What the hell kind
of business this is.

02:00:49.976 --> 02:00:52.410
Don't need you okayin'.

02:00:52.478 --> 02:00:56.915
<i>Schoolboy things in your
head. Badness for you.</i>

02:00:56.983 --> 02:00:59.349
Badness for her.

02:00:59.418 --> 02:01:02.717
Badness for me,
lyin' here,

02:01:02.788 --> 02:01:04.915
tumor big as a breadfruit,

02:01:04.991 --> 02:01:09.621
poisonin' me inside,
and waitin'.

02:01:09.695 --> 02:01:13.324
Bring you flowers, and all
I's gettin' is aggravation.

02:01:13.399 --> 02:01:16.596
The only flowers
I want to see...

02:01:16.669 --> 02:01:21.402
is the ones over my peaceful
self resting in the dirt.

02:01:21.474 --> 02:01:24.739
Can't do no right by people. Come
to take you, you want to stay.

02:01:24.810 --> 02:01:28.143
Leave you stay, you want to go. Rahtid.

02:01:30.883 --> 02:01:35.513
You're not in
your right place, mister.

02:01:35.588 --> 02:01:37.988
Me neither.

02:01:38.057 --> 02:01:40.048
No more.

02:01:40.126 --> 02:01:42.959
Take me, and you come
with me now.

02:01:53.906 --> 02:01:57.034
But I not lonely here.

02:01:59.211 --> 02:02:02.009
Somebody want me here.

02:02:03.849 --> 02:02:05.976
Hmm.

02:02:06.052 --> 02:02:09.818
It nice
it happen to you.

02:02:09.889 --> 02:02:13.655
Like you come to the island
and had a holiday.

02:02:15.594 --> 02:02:20.190
Sun didn't burn you red-red,
just brown.

02:02:20.266 --> 02:02:25.260
<i>You sleep,
and no mosquito eat you.</i>

02:02:25.338 --> 02:02:29.638
But the truth is,
it bound to happen...

02:02:29.709 --> 02:02:32.542
if you stay long enough.

02:02:34.280 --> 02:02:38.910
So take that nice picture you
got in your head home with you,

02:02:40.386 --> 02:02:43.514
but don't be fooled.

02:02:47.660 --> 02:02:50.959
We lonely here mostly too.

02:02:52.832 --> 02:02:55.767
<i>If we lucky, maybe...</i>

02:02:57.370 --> 02:03:01.466
we got some nice pictures
to take with us.

02:03:25.598 --> 02:03:28.499
You got
enough nice pictures?

02:03:32.738 --> 02:03:34.672
Yes.

02:04:29.195 --> 02:04:31.789
Good-bye, sister.

02:04:55.354 --> 02:04:57.845
Yes?

02:04:57.923 --> 02:05:01.791
I have the feeling,
all in all,

02:05:01.861 --> 02:05:06.560
what I made this voyage for
has served its purpose.

02:05:09.101 --> 02:05:13.265
What are you saying?
It's time to go?

02:05:20.145 --> 02:05:22.477
I'm ready.

02:05:22.548 --> 02:05:24.914
You are?

02:05:26.352 --> 02:05:28.445
Yeah.

02:05:30.990 --> 02:05:36.121
Good. Tomorrow.
After the party.

02:06:07.026 --> 02:06:09.119
Yes, Helen?
Telephone call, sir.

02:06:09.194 --> 02:06:11.856
Mr. Sloane from New York. Thank you.

02:06:11.931 --> 02:06:13.865
Excuse me.

02:06:24.743 --> 02:06:26.802
Thank you.

02:06:30.950 --> 02:06:32.884
Hey!

02:06:33.953 --> 02:06:35.887
Hey.

02:06:38.057 --> 02:06:40.525
Red or white?

02:06:40.593 --> 02:06:43.027
No. No, thank you.
Have a drink.

02:06:43.095 --> 02:06:46.496
You look like you need
one as bad as me. I do?

02:06:50.269 --> 02:06:53.636
Quince?
Mm-hmm.

02:06:53.706 --> 02:06:56.334
I find myself
a little confused.

02:07:00.112 --> 02:07:02.546
Confused, huh?
Yes.

02:07:02.615 --> 02:07:04.606
About what?
Love.

02:07:04.683 --> 02:07:07.311
Love.

02:07:07.386 --> 02:07:11.049
Oh, man.
I got problems of my own.

02:07:14.293 --> 02:07:18.354
You love Allison, don't you? Yes, I do.

02:07:18.430 --> 02:07:20.364
How did you meet?

02:07:21.867 --> 02:07:24.233
Well, um,

02:07:24.303 --> 02:07:28.399
I was this world-class loser, and
she was this happy little rich girl,

02:07:28.474 --> 02:07:31.671
and for some reason
she took me in.

02:07:33.579 --> 02:07:36.309
But Allison loves you.

02:07:46.992 --> 02:07:49.324
How do you know?

02:07:54.400 --> 02:07:58.166
Because she knows the worst
thing about me, and it's okay.

02:07:58.237 --> 02:08:02.537
What is it? No, it's not one
thing. It's just an idea, Joe.

02:08:02.608 --> 02:08:05.509
It's just, um, um...

02:08:07.012 --> 02:08:11.244
It's like you know
each other's secrets,

02:08:12.351 --> 02:08:16.344
your deepest,
darkest secrets.

02:08:16.422 --> 02:08:21.291
Deepest, darkest secrets? Yeah,
and then you... you're free.

02:08:21.360 --> 02:08:23.351
Free?

02:08:24.530 --> 02:08:27.499
You're free!
You're free to l...

02:08:27.566 --> 02:08:30.194
love each other
completely, totally.

02:08:30.269 --> 02:08:33.830
Just no fear.

02:08:33.906 --> 02:08:37.637
So there's nothing you don't know
about each other, and it's okay.

02:08:40.379 --> 02:08:42.313
Hmm.

02:08:51.090 --> 02:08:56.995
Do you like me, Joe? Oh, yes,
Quince. You're one of my favorites.

02:09:02.034 --> 02:09:07.370
What would you say if you knew it
was me who brought down Bill Parrish?

02:09:10.609 --> 02:09:14.602
Oh, I told Drew and the board
that Bill depended on you.

02:09:14.680 --> 02:09:17.478
Drew and Bontecou are gonna chop up
the company, sell it off for parts.

02:09:17.549 --> 02:09:19.483
Bontecou was outside.
Drew was Mr. Inside.

02:09:19.551 --> 02:09:24.614
And I was the fool
who made it all happen.

02:09:27.726 --> 02:09:29.694
Ohh...

02:09:30.763 --> 02:09:32.697
God.

02:09:40.272 --> 02:09:42.797
What do I do?

02:09:42.875 --> 02:09:46.003
Go to Bill Parrish
and tell him the truth.

02:09:46.078 --> 02:09:48.512
He'll forgive you.

02:09:50.716 --> 02:09:53.776
You think so?
Yes.

02:09:56.722 --> 02:09:59.782
You think I should wait
till after the party?

02:09:59.858 --> 02:10:01.792
No.

02:10:04.797 --> 02:10:07.197
No.

02:10:07.266 --> 02:10:10.861
Four down here
and a sturgeon up there.

02:10:10.936 --> 02:10:13.734
<i>This one is perfect.
Absolutely.</i>

02:10:13.806 --> 02:10:17.435
<i>Okay, I think I want
four here like that...</i>

02:10:17.509 --> 02:10:19.977
Hi, Daddy.
Hi.

02:10:20.045 --> 02:10:22.673
What do you think?

02:10:22.748 --> 02:10:26.377
Well, it's, uh...
it's starting to grow on me.

02:10:26.451 --> 02:10:29.716
Oh, I've got a baritone
with a balalaika...

02:10:29.788 --> 02:10:32.382
coming from
the Russian Tea Room.

02:10:32.457 --> 02:10:36.553
I've dressed him in a Cossack shirt,
and he'll be singing Nelson Eddy songs.

02:10:36.628 --> 02:10:38.562
Wow.

02:10:40.465 --> 02:10:42.831
You really are amazing.

02:10:42.901 --> 02:10:47.201
But why, oh, why, Allison,
are you doing all this?

02:10:50.776 --> 02:10:55.440
I do it because I love
you. Everybody loves you:

02:10:55.514 --> 02:10:59.746
Mommy, wherever she is,
Susan, Quince...

02:11:01.119 --> 02:11:05.579
<i>all the people you work with,
anyone who's ever met you.</i>

02:11:06.792 --> 02:11:09.056
Ohh, Daddy.

02:11:09.127 --> 02:11:13.257
After all, you've been
a wonderful father.

02:11:15.534 --> 02:11:17.934
Yeah, well,

02:11:18.003 --> 02:11:20.164
I haven't been the father
to you that, uh...

02:11:20.239 --> 02:11:22.935
That you've been to Susan?
I wasn't going to say that.

02:11:23.008 --> 02:11:26.808
But that's what you were
thinking. And that's okay.

02:11:26.879 --> 02:11:29.074
Because I know
that you love me.

02:11:29.147 --> 02:11:32.412
I mean, it's not
like it is with her.

02:11:32.484 --> 02:11:36.215
Whenever she walks into the
room, your eyes light up.

02:11:36.288 --> 02:11:39.553
She always gets a smile
from you, as opposed to me.

02:11:39.625 --> 02:11:42.458
When I walk in,

02:11:42.527 --> 02:11:46.554
this look comes over your face,
like, "What does she want now?"

02:11:46.632 --> 02:11:50.329
<i>But you've never let either
of us want for anything.</i>

02:11:50.402 --> 02:11:54.270
Oh, God. More than that,
Daddy, more than that.

02:11:59.177 --> 02:12:03.341
I've felt loved,
and that's all that matters.

02:12:03.415 --> 02:12:06.942
So, never mind favorites.

02:12:07.019 --> 02:12:08.953
You're allowed to have one.

02:12:09.021 --> 02:12:12.320
The point is,
you've been mine.

02:12:15.060 --> 02:12:16.994
Oh, Allison.

02:12:18.730 --> 02:12:20.664
Oh.

02:12:24.169 --> 02:12:26.160
I really feel...

02:12:27.873 --> 02:12:30.842
I've everything I could've
ever wanted for my birthday.

02:12:30.909 --> 02:12:33.878
Oh, wait a minute!

02:12:33.946 --> 02:12:38.280
There's more to come. Lots
of excess, like you love.

02:12:40.686 --> 02:12:45.316
You know, this is gonna
be a wonderful party.

02:12:47.092 --> 02:12:49.026
Yes, it is.

02:12:52.664 --> 02:12:55.656
Thank you.
Thank you.

02:12:58.136 --> 02:13:01.594
Happy birthday!
Thanks.

02:13:26.832 --> 02:13:28.697
Thanks.
You're welcome.

02:13:28.767 --> 02:13:31.531
Good evening.
Thank you.

02:13:36.508 --> 02:13:38.533
Hello.
Welcome.

02:13:38.610 --> 02:13:41.374
<i>Hi, Susan. Hi, Simone. How are you?</i>

02:13:46.485 --> 02:13:49.943
Hi, darling.
Oh, hi, Gene. Hi.

02:14:17.049 --> 02:14:20.280
My father told me
you might be leaving.

02:14:21.353 --> 02:14:23.981
Your father and I...

02:14:24.056 --> 02:14:28.425
Our time together
has come to an end.

02:14:38.136 --> 02:14:42.004
I'm in love...
with a man,

02:14:43.408 --> 02:14:46.172
but I don't know
who he is,

02:14:46.244 --> 02:14:48.712
where he's going
or when.

02:14:51.650 --> 02:14:53.880
I can tell you
the when part.

02:14:55.320 --> 02:14:57.515
Tonight.

02:15:00.225 --> 02:15:02.819
So it does get worse.

02:15:02.894 --> 02:15:05.727
No worse
than it gets for me.

02:15:10.802 --> 02:15:13.896
I'm in love
with a woman who...

02:15:16.708 --> 02:15:21.811
I don't wanna leave.

02:15:23.582 --> 02:15:25.743
Ohh.

02:15:25.817 --> 02:15:27.842
Then don't.

02:15:31.590 --> 02:15:35.151
There's so little
we know about each other.

02:15:35.227 --> 02:15:37.457
There's so much
I should tell you.

02:15:37.529 --> 02:15:41.158
That'll come.
That'll come.

02:15:45.437 --> 02:15:48.895
Will it?
Mm-hmm.

02:15:52.177 --> 02:15:54.805
I wanna be
with you, Joe.

02:16:03.522 --> 02:16:06.491
I opened my big mouth
one too many times.

02:16:06.558 --> 02:16:09.721
Everything just got
all, uh, twisted.

02:16:09.794 --> 02:16:12.285
It's okay, Quince.
I understand.

02:16:12.364 --> 02:16:15.492
You've always meant well,
and I appreciate that.

02:16:15.567 --> 02:16:19.094
<i>Sometimes things
just turn out wrong.</i>

02:16:19.171 --> 02:16:21.105
<i>Yeah?</i>

02:16:22.941 --> 02:16:25.341
Excuse me. No, no... Uh, Joe, come in.

02:16:25.410 --> 02:16:27.935
Um, I wanna thank you.
Is it okay, Bill?

02:16:28.013 --> 02:16:31.540
- Sure.
- Joe knows the whole story. I told him.

02:16:31.616 --> 02:16:35.313
And it was his idea that
I come clean. I mean...

02:16:35.387 --> 02:16:37.787
I wanted to come clean,
but, uh,

02:16:37.856 --> 02:16:41.189
he gave me a pair of
balls, you know what I mean?

02:16:41.259 --> 02:16:43.955
Yeah,
I believe I do.

02:16:49.267 --> 02:16:51.826
Anyway, uh,

02:16:51.903 --> 02:16:54.565
I can see you guys
got business.

02:16:54.638 --> 02:16:59.235
<i>No. However, I do have some
unfinished business with Drew.</i>

02:16:59.311 --> 02:17:01.870
Get him on the helicopter.
Get him out here tonight.

02:17:01.947 --> 02:17:04.848
<i>I wanna tell this guy how I
feel about him face-to-face.</i>

02:17:04.915 --> 02:17:10.148
That could be a tall order, B.P. I doubt
if Drew is anxious to see you face-to-face.

02:17:16.193 --> 02:17:19.163
- I'll deliver the package.
- Okay.

02:17:31.376 --> 02:17:34.777
- How are you doing?
- What the hell do you care?

02:17:34.846 --> 02:17:37.610
Just asking, Bill.

02:17:40.050 --> 02:17:42.815
You wanna know?
I'll tell you.

02:17:42.887 --> 02:17:46.323
You're looking at a man who is not walking
through the valley of the shadow of death.

02:17:46.391 --> 02:17:48.985
He's galloping into it. At the
same time, the business he built...

02:17:49.059 --> 02:17:52.620
with his own hands and head has been
commandeered by a couple of cheap pirates.

02:17:52.697 --> 02:17:56.531
Oh, yes! I almost forgot. My
daughter's fallen in love with Death.

02:17:56.601 --> 02:17:59.536
And I'm in love
with your daughter.

02:18:01.606 --> 02:18:03.540
Say again?

02:18:07.679 --> 02:18:11.638
I'm in love with your daughter,
and I'm taking her with me tonight.

02:18:12.816 --> 02:18:16.308
- You what?
- I think you heard me, Bill.

02:18:16.388 --> 02:18:19.846
You're not taking Susan anywhere. What
does that mean, anyway? We had a deal.

02:18:19.924 --> 02:18:22.688
And I'm sorry.

02:18:25.063 --> 02:18:28.327
Susan's my daughter. She has
a wonderful life ahead of her.

02:18:28.400 --> 02:18:31.528
You're gonna deprive her of it,
and you're telling me you're sorry?

02:18:31.602 --> 02:18:33.867
I'm sorry.
Apology not accepted.

02:18:33.938 --> 02:18:37.669
I don't care, Bill.
I love her.

02:18:39.144 --> 02:18:41.611
How perfect for you...

02:18:41.680 --> 02:18:45.308
to take whatever you want
because it pleases you.

02:18:45.383 --> 02:18:47.681
That's not love.

02:18:47.752 --> 02:18:49.879
Then what is it?

02:18:49.954 --> 02:18:54.516
Some aimless infatuation which, for
the moment, you feel like indulging.

02:18:54.592 --> 02:18:57.152
It's missing everything
that matters.

02:18:57.227 --> 02:18:59.058
Which is what?

02:18:59.129 --> 02:19:01.791
Trust, responsibility,

02:19:01.866 --> 02:19:03.799
taking the weight for
your choices and feelings...

02:19:03.868 --> 02:19:06.462
and spending the rest of
your life living up to them,

02:19:06.538 --> 02:19:10.269
and above all, not hurting
the object of your love.

02:19:10.342 --> 02:19:12.572
So that's love according
to William Parrish?

02:19:12.644 --> 02:19:15.704
Multiply it by infinity and
take it to the depth of forever,

02:19:15.780 --> 02:19:19.442
and you will still have barely a
glimpse of what I'm talking about.

02:19:19.517 --> 02:19:23.248
Those were my words.
They're mine now.

02:19:23.321 --> 02:19:28.623
Bill, Susan wants to come
with me. She loves me.

02:19:28.692 --> 02:19:30.718
She loves you?
Mm-hmm.

02:19:30.795 --> 02:19:33.228
<i>Who is you? Did you
tell her who you are?</i>

02:19:33.298 --> 02:19:37.632
No. Does she know
where she's going? Huh?

02:19:39.404 --> 02:19:42.373
You see, Susan went for
that poor son of a bitch...

02:19:42.440 --> 02:19:45.567
whose body you took, and
everything since has been aftermath.

02:19:45.643 --> 02:19:47.611
You don't know
what love is.

02:19:47.679 --> 02:19:49.613
She doesn't know
who you are.

02:19:49.681 --> 02:19:53.947
You make a deal; you're
breaking it. Bottom line is, Joe,

02:19:54.018 --> 02:19:56.714
you're swindling her soul, and you're
doing it with your eyes wide open.

02:19:56.788 --> 02:20:00.246
I don't like what you're saying. I'm
past caring what you like and don't.

02:20:00.325 --> 02:20:03.021
You're stealing my daughter, and
I'm not gonna let you. You're not?

02:20:03.094 --> 02:20:05.255
No.
Are you threatening me?

02:20:05.330 --> 02:20:08.128
Yeah,
I certainly hope so.

02:20:08.199 --> 02:20:10.133
Yeah.

02:20:12.404 --> 02:20:16.898
I loved Susan from the moment she was born,
and I love her now and every minute in between.

02:20:16.975 --> 02:20:20.968
And what I dream of is a man who will discover
her, and that she will discover a man...

02:20:21.045 --> 02:20:25.004
who will love her, who is worthy of
her, who is of this world, this time...

02:20:25.083 --> 02:20:27.347
and has the grace, compassion and
fortitude to walk beside her...

02:20:27.419 --> 02:20:29.353
as she makes her way
through life.

02:20:29.421 --> 02:20:31.355
Enough!

02:20:33.658 --> 02:20:37.025
What I know is what I want,
and what I want is Susan.

02:20:37.095 --> 02:20:39.256
And I will have her,
and she will have me.

02:20:39.330 --> 02:20:44.097
And that's the way it's going to
be. And there's nothing you can do.

02:20:46.538 --> 02:20:49.063
Why did you
tell me all this, Joe?

02:20:49.140 --> 02:20:51.199
You're the big shot,
the biggest shot of all.

02:20:51.276 --> 02:20:55.235
You don't have to ask permission, but
that's what you're doing. Do you know why?

02:20:55.313 --> 02:20:59.374
<i>Because you've somehow developed into a
good guy, and you know this is all wrong.</i>

02:21:00.618 --> 02:21:03.519
I don't know what
you're gonna do, but, uh,

02:21:03.588 --> 02:21:05.647
how can this be love?

02:21:05.723 --> 02:21:08.487
She doesn't know
who you are.

02:21:08.560 --> 02:21:12.792
<i>Why don't you tell her,
try it out, see what happens?</i>

02:21:12.864 --> 02:21:17.631
Reveal everything there is to know about
yourself and let the chips fall where they may.

02:21:21.306 --> 02:21:23.672
<i>Okay?</i>

02:21:26.911 --> 02:21:30.608
I've given it my best shot.
I, uh...

02:21:30.682 --> 02:21:34.641
I wish I could tell you
to sleep on it.

02:21:55.206 --> 02:21:58.141
Oh, um...

02:21:58.209 --> 02:22:00.700
I'm sorry.
Would you excuse me?

02:22:00.778 --> 02:22:02.905
Sure.
Okay, nice to see you.

02:22:02.981 --> 02:22:05.347
Nice to see you.

02:22:21.132 --> 02:22:23.430
There's something
so indescribably sexy...

02:22:23.501 --> 02:22:25.935
about you standing
in the middle of a crowd.

02:22:26.004 --> 02:22:29.940
I could make love to you
right here.

02:22:41.519 --> 02:22:46.821
You're trying to tell me my future,
you're looking on the wrong side.

02:22:50.828 --> 02:22:54.264
There is something
I do want to tell you.

02:23:01.506 --> 02:23:03.440
But you can't?

02:23:10.748 --> 02:23:14.309
Just now when you hesitated,
I got a chill.

02:23:16.487 --> 02:23:19.251
Remember that morning
in the coffee shop?

02:23:19.324 --> 02:23:24.626
When you said, "What's wrong
with taking care of a woman?

02:23:24.696 --> 02:23:26.789
She takes care of you."

02:23:29.534 --> 02:23:32.025
Did I say that?
Mm-hmm.

02:23:32.103 --> 02:23:37.370
And I said you'd have a hard time
finding a woman like that these days.

02:23:40.979 --> 02:23:43.140
Well, you found one, Joe.

02:23:45.016 --> 02:23:47.109
The coffee shop.

02:23:48.586 --> 02:23:53.683
That was the place,
and you were the guy.

02:23:56.227 --> 02:23:59.162
And you said that, uh,

02:23:59.230 --> 02:24:02.131
that you didn't want me
to be your doctor because...

02:24:02.200 --> 02:24:07.103
you didn't want me
to examine you.

02:24:07.171 --> 02:24:10.538
Why, I got to examine you,
after all.

02:24:20.051 --> 02:24:22.485
I could come with you.

02:24:26.324 --> 02:24:28.417
You want me to wait?

02:24:28.493 --> 02:24:31.223
You'll come back?

02:24:38.836 --> 02:24:41.498
May I kiss you?

02:25:07.965 --> 02:25:10.900
That felt like good-bye.

02:25:16.340 --> 02:25:19.537
What's going on, Joe?

02:25:19.610 --> 02:25:22.602
I feel like
we're lifting off.

02:25:26.451 --> 02:25:28.442
I'm still here.

02:25:33.791 --> 02:25:36.282
But you're not.

02:25:38.329 --> 02:25:40.559
You're somewhere else.

02:26:17.602 --> 02:26:19.661
You're someone else.

02:26:24.275 --> 02:26:27.301
Don't you want to ask who?

02:26:28.613 --> 02:26:31.377
Yes, but...
"But"?

02:26:39.257 --> 02:26:41.555
Joe, I'm afraid.

02:26:42.627 --> 02:26:44.686
Afraid to find out?

02:26:44.762 --> 02:26:47.731
Don't be.

02:26:48.800 --> 02:26:52.998
It doesn't matter what I am.

02:26:53.070 --> 02:26:56.062
You know who I am.

02:27:05.049 --> 02:27:06.983
You're...

02:27:17.028 --> 02:27:19.690
You're...

02:27:39.483 --> 02:27:41.747
You're Joe.

02:27:48.426 --> 02:27:52.192
Yes, I'm Joe.

02:27:57.335 --> 02:28:00.133
Oh.

02:28:00.204 --> 02:28:02.604
And I promise you...

02:28:05.610 --> 02:28:10.877
you will always have what
you found in the coffee shop.

02:28:18.155 --> 02:28:22.216
Tell me that you love me.
Tell me that you love me now.

02:28:23.294 --> 02:28:26.229
I love you now.

02:28:26.297 --> 02:28:28.788
I'll love you always.

02:28:33.838 --> 02:28:36.136
Susan.

02:28:37.708 --> 02:28:39.801
Yes?

02:28:41.746 --> 02:28:44.306
Thank you for loving me.

02:29:13.911 --> 02:29:17.540
We should think about
getting started, Bill.

02:29:20.184 --> 02:29:22.118
Mm-hmm.

02:29:28.492 --> 02:29:31.188
It'll just be us.

02:29:34.999 --> 02:29:36.990
Thank you.

02:29:43.374 --> 02:29:45.501
Bill?

02:29:47.345 --> 02:29:50.007
Come in.

02:29:51.582 --> 02:29:55.074
I got him. The helicopter
will be here in two minutes.

02:29:55.152 --> 02:29:58.053
How are we on time?

02:29:58.122 --> 02:30:00.682
Okay.

02:30:00.758 --> 02:30:02.487
Get him in here.

02:30:02.560 --> 02:30:05.996
May?

02:30:06.063 --> 02:30:08.190
Yes, sir?
I know you're busy,

02:30:08.265 --> 02:30:10.563
but I want you to put in a call
to Eddie Sloane for me.

02:30:10.634 --> 02:30:13.262
At home, sir?
No, he's at the office.

02:30:13.537 --> 02:30:16.665
This is damn big
of Bill.

02:30:16.741 --> 02:30:18.766
Ooh. You all right?
Yeah.

02:30:18.843 --> 02:30:20.936
Also smart, you know?

02:30:21.012 --> 02:30:24.675
Well, he had no choice. He knows
you're a formidable adversary.

02:30:24.749 --> 02:30:28.116
He said that? Yeah, I mean,
you got him by the short hairs.

02:30:28.185 --> 02:30:30.210
Yeah, the short
and gray hairs.

02:30:30.287 --> 02:30:33.120
<i>We're all here, Bill.
I appreciate this, Eddie.</i>

02:30:33.190 --> 02:30:38.218
Members of the board, this will
just take a minute of your time.

02:30:38.295 --> 02:30:42.959
As custodians of the company, you may
receive information from what follows...

02:30:43.034 --> 02:30:47.630
that will be valuable
to you or not.

02:30:47.705 --> 02:30:50.196
Either way, thanks.
We're all ears.

02:30:50.274 --> 02:30:51.707
<i>Thanks.</i>

02:30:54.445 --> 02:30:56.379
Good evening, Bill.

02:30:56.447 --> 02:30:58.745
Thank you, Quince.

02:30:58.816 --> 02:31:04.311
I just wanted to say how appreciative
I am of this, um, grand gesture.

02:31:04.388 --> 02:31:06.151
Shut up and sit down.

02:31:12.229 --> 02:31:14.663
<i>You're a useless sack
of shit, Drew.</i>

02:31:14.732 --> 02:31:16.723
You played footsie
with John Bontecou...

02:31:16.801 --> 02:31:19.269
so you could dismember my
company to line your own pockets.

02:31:19.336 --> 02:31:22.396
I don't know where you get
that idea. The board agreed...

02:31:22.473 --> 02:31:26.569
The board didn't know you were a mole who
burrowed inside so you could bury us all.

02:31:26.644 --> 02:31:29.943
Is this Mr. Black's fantasy?
Another one of his whoppers?

02:31:30.014 --> 02:31:33.211
Aren't you sick of this asshole
lurking around? Nobody knows who he is.

02:31:33.284 --> 02:31:35.252
But one thing
everybody does know,

02:31:35.319 --> 02:31:38.948
he somehow got your ear and has been
pouring poison into it ever since.

02:31:39.023 --> 02:31:42.220
You're the poison, Drew.

02:31:42.293 --> 02:31:45.194
You've operated behind the scenes
to suborn the trust of a man...

02:31:45.262 --> 02:31:49.028
who has stamped you with his imprimatur
of class, elegance and stature.

02:31:49.100 --> 02:31:53.764
<i>I've had the opportunity to be witness
to every kind and degree of deception.</i>

02:31:53.838 --> 02:31:57.467
But Bill Parrish has been on the receiving
end of machinations so Machiavellian...

02:31:57.541 --> 02:31:59.805
that it has rarely been
my experience to encounter.

02:31:59.877 --> 02:32:05.474
And yet, he has combatted them stoically and
selflessly, without revealing my identity.

02:32:05.549 --> 02:32:08.643
Had he violated
the vow of secrecy he took,

02:32:08.719 --> 02:32:11.279
<i>his task would
have been far easier.</i>

02:32:11.355 --> 02:32:14.290
<i>He could have turned
defeat into victory.</i>

02:32:14.358 --> 02:32:17.293
But he is too honorable a man
to have done that.

02:32:17.361 --> 02:32:22.697
Because of me, he has lost his
work, his company, his reputation.

02:32:22.766 --> 02:32:26.759
So now,
given these losses,

02:32:26.837 --> 02:32:31.297
I'm compelled to end
the need for secrecy.

02:32:32.910 --> 02:32:35.470
The time has come
to tell you who I am.

02:32:41.118 --> 02:32:44.087
So tell me. Tell me.
I'm peeing in my pants.

02:32:44.155 --> 02:32:47.022
- And you're going to pee some more.
- Joe, don't do this.

02:32:47.091 --> 02:32:49.753
It's okay, Bill. It's time
we put this person in his place.

02:32:49.827 --> 02:32:52.557
<i>It's not necessary, Joe.
Drew's gonna step aside.</i>

02:32:52.630 --> 02:32:55.690
- I'm not stepping anywhere.
- I appreciate your gentlemanliness.

02:32:55.766 --> 02:32:57.927
But what we need to do here
is drive the dagger home.

02:32:58.002 --> 02:33:00.368
- "The dagger"?
- I told you to shut up!

02:33:00.437 --> 02:33:02.928
Prepare yourself, Drew.

02:33:03.007 --> 02:33:05.532
<i>I...
Joe, please.</i>

02:33:05.609 --> 02:33:07.440
Kindly let me
take it from here.

02:33:07.511 --> 02:33:09.240
<i>Am...
Don't.</i>

02:33:14.084 --> 02:33:17.281
An agent for the
Internal Revenue Service.

02:33:25.029 --> 02:33:26.018
Bill?
Huh?

02:33:26.096 --> 02:33:27.791
Bill.

02:33:31.535 --> 02:33:32.968
Bill.
Yeah.

02:33:33.037 --> 02:33:36.700
Yes, he's, um...

02:33:36.774 --> 02:33:40.005
He's an agent for the
Internal Revenue Service.

02:33:40.077 --> 02:33:42.944
Mmm, yes, we were convinced
that Bontecou, on past deals,

02:33:43.013 --> 02:33:45.004
has structured his mergers
and acquisitions...

02:33:45.082 --> 02:33:49.280
in suspicious and complicated ways so as
to evade paying the taxes he is liable for.

02:33:49.353 --> 02:33:54.313
<i>The agency asked Bill for his cooperation
in an undercover investigation of Bontecou.</i>

02:33:54.391 --> 02:34:00.296
We wanted to go after him, and this
deal gave us that perfect opportunity.

02:34:00.364 --> 02:34:04.801
And I offered to cooperate.
And we're very grateful.

02:34:04.868 --> 02:34:09.498
Uh, Agent Joe Black here... Of
course, that's not his real name...

02:34:09.573 --> 02:34:11.564
smelled out
your involvement, Drew.

02:34:11.642 --> 02:34:15.772
<i>He developed evidence you were
working both sides of the fence.</i>

02:34:15.846 --> 02:34:20.180
Unfortunately, that is what is
known as a conflict of interest.

02:34:20.251 --> 02:34:22.242
Undisclosed
conflict of interest.

02:34:22.319 --> 02:34:24.514
An offense.
An indictable offense.

02:34:24.588 --> 02:34:27.921
And a likely conviction. Very likely.

02:34:27.992 --> 02:34:30.927
I think I'd like
to talk to my lawyer.

02:34:30.995 --> 02:34:35.489
No lawyers, Drew. Uh, we're
gonna offer you a deal.

02:34:35.566 --> 02:34:39.195
Confess to the board every detail of your
participation, then submit your resignation.

02:34:39.270 --> 02:34:40.931
What do I get?

02:34:41.005 --> 02:34:42.666
You get not to go to jail.

02:34:42.740 --> 02:34:44.833
You're talking
through your hat.

02:34:44.908 --> 02:34:47.433
You're offering me a deal
because you've got no proof.

02:34:47.511 --> 02:34:51.607
Proof? We've got plenty of proof.
He's talking through his lips.

02:34:51.682 --> 02:34:55.709
Drew, make no mistake. Should you
choose to test my resolve in this matter,

02:34:55.786 --> 02:34:58.550
you will be looking at an outcome
that will have a finality...

02:34:58.622 --> 02:35:00.920
that is beyond
your comprehension.

02:35:00.991 --> 02:35:04.950
And you will not be counting the
days or the months or the years,

02:35:05.029 --> 02:35:08.328
but millenniums
in a place with no doors.

02:35:11.268 --> 02:35:13.702
All right, you win.

02:35:13.771 --> 02:35:16.137
Soon as I get back to the city,
I'll meet with the board.

02:35:16.206 --> 02:35:19.334
<i>You're meeting with the board right
now, Drew. Resignation accepted.</i>

02:35:19.410 --> 02:35:23.710
Moreover, I propose a motion
to reconfirm William Parrish...

02:35:23.781 --> 02:35:26.875
as chairman of the board
of Parrish Communications,

02:35:26.950 --> 02:35:30.681
<i>as well as a rejection of the
merger with Bontecou International.</i>

02:35:30.754 --> 02:35:34.087
<i>How say you,
board? - Yes. - Yes.</i>

02:35:34.158 --> 02:35:36.456
<i>- Yes.
- Yes. The motion is passed.</i>

02:35:36.527 --> 02:35:38.654
<i>Thank you.
That's great.</i>

02:35:38.729 --> 02:35:42.529
But it's more than I bargained for. I
just wanted to set the record straight.

02:35:42.599 --> 02:35:46.831
<i>You have. Sounds like these guys want you
back, Bill. We'll get their apologies later.</i>

02:35:46.904 --> 02:35:50.772
<i>Meanwhile, enjoy your party. Celebrate.
I'll attend to the nasty details.</i>

02:35:50.841 --> 02:35:53.332
And, Mr. Black,
may we say thank you?

02:35:53.410 --> 02:35:56.504
My pleasure.
This is an I.R.S. Agent's dream.

02:35:56.580 --> 02:35:58.741
I'll be promoted
chief of section off this.

02:36:05.456 --> 02:36:08.516
Who would have believed it?

02:36:08.592 --> 02:36:10.753
You an I.R.S. Agent?

02:36:13.364 --> 02:36:16.458
Death and taxes.

02:36:24.641 --> 02:36:28.202
<i>~ Happy birthday to you ~</i>

02:36:28.278 --> 02:36:31.611
~ Happy birthday to you ~

02:36:31.682 --> 02:36:37.211
~ Happy birthday
dear William ~

02:36:37.287 --> 02:36:42.953
~ Happy birthday to you ~

02:37:25.202 --> 02:37:28.194
Speech! Speech!
Speech!

02:37:28.272 --> 02:37:33.141
Speech! Speech! Speech!

02:37:33.210 --> 02:37:35.610
Thank you.

02:37:37.981 --> 02:37:42.975
I thought I was gonna
sneak away tonight. No!

02:37:45.055 --> 02:37:48.115
What a glorious night.

02:37:48.192 --> 02:37:50.626
Every face I see
is a memory.

02:37:50.694 --> 02:37:55.654
It may not be a perfectly
perfect memory.

02:37:55.732 --> 02:38:01.227
Uh, sometimes we had
our ups and downs.

02:38:01.305 --> 02:38:03.671
But we're all together,

02:38:03.740 --> 02:38:07.073
and you're mine for a night.

02:38:10.013 --> 02:38:15.849
And I'm gonna break precedent
and tell you my one candle wish.

02:38:15.919 --> 02:38:19.082
That you would have a life
as lucky as mine,

02:38:19.156 --> 02:38:24.184
<i>where you can wake up
one morning and say,</i>

02:38:24.261 --> 02:38:27.287
"I don't want anything more."

02:38:36.440 --> 02:38:40.342
Sixty-five years.

02:38:40.410 --> 02:38:43.937
Don't they
go by in a blink?

02:39:26.924 --> 02:39:28.915
Hi.

02:39:28.992 --> 02:39:32.553
Oh. What a night.

02:39:32.629 --> 02:39:36.258
I'm having
a hell of a time.

02:39:39.036 --> 02:39:42.802
You were right...
about Joe.

02:39:42.873 --> 02:39:45.671
He, uh...

02:39:45.742 --> 02:39:47.676
He is going somewhere.

02:39:49.513 --> 02:39:51.504
I'm sorry.

02:39:53.850 --> 02:39:56.080
You relieved?

02:39:57.154 --> 02:40:00.282
Yes, but...

02:40:00.357 --> 02:40:02.848
But what?

02:40:09.099 --> 02:40:11.829
I want you to know
how much I love you,

02:40:11.902 --> 02:40:15.201
that you've given a meaning to my
life that I had no right to expect,

02:40:15.272 --> 02:40:17.763
that no one can
ever take from me.

02:40:17.841 --> 02:40:19.968
Dad...
No!

02:40:20.043 --> 02:40:24.104
I love you so much.

02:40:24.181 --> 02:40:27.116
And I want you
to promise me something.

02:40:27.184 --> 02:40:31.712
I don't want you
to ever worry about me.

02:40:31.788 --> 02:40:35.280
And if anything should
happen, I'm gonna be okay.

02:40:35.359 --> 02:40:38.294
And everything's
gonna be all right.

02:40:38.362 --> 02:40:40.296
And I have no regrets.

02:40:40.364 --> 02:40:43.697
And I want you
to feel the same way.

02:40:49.473 --> 02:40:51.407
I love you, Daddy.

02:40:51.475 --> 02:40:54.239
That's why it's okay.

02:40:59.583 --> 02:41:01.517
No regrets?

02:41:03.320 --> 02:41:05.379
No regrets.

02:41:05.455 --> 02:41:07.685
That's a good feeling,
isn't it?

02:41:07.758 --> 02:41:10.454
Yeah.

02:41:14.498 --> 02:41:16.728
Everybody's saying good-bye.

02:41:19.670 --> 02:41:22.104
I'm still here.

02:41:23.974 --> 02:41:26.442
Would you like to dance
with me, Susan?

02:41:29.413 --> 02:41:31.643
Yeah.

02:41:36.887 --> 02:41:39.549
If you don't mind dancing
with an old fogey like me.

02:41:39.623 --> 02:41:44.822
Oh, Dad, you're not old.

02:41:49.166 --> 02:41:51.794
You'll never be old.

02:41:56.506 --> 02:41:58.440
Can I get you
anything, sir?

02:41:58.508 --> 02:42:01.636
No.

02:42:01.712 --> 02:42:04.203
Do you have
any peanut butter?

02:42:05.582 --> 02:42:07.777
Uh, I don't think so, sir.

02:42:07.851 --> 02:42:12.584
Mmm. Thank you anyway.

02:42:12.656 --> 02:42:15.147
You're welcome.

02:43:54.090 --> 02:43:56.422
What's that?

02:43:56.493 --> 02:43:59.018
The fireworks are starting.

02:43:59.095 --> 02:44:02.292
Let's go down and watch.

02:44:06.136 --> 02:44:10.095
Shall we?
You go on ahead, honey.

02:44:10.173 --> 02:44:12.733
I'm just gonna
catch my breath.

02:44:20.917 --> 02:44:22.851
Okay.

02:44:41.238 --> 02:44:43.172
Okay.

02:45:56.846 --> 02:45:59.337
Happy birthday, Bill.

02:45:59.416 --> 02:46:01.350
Thank you.

02:46:04.120 --> 02:46:06.554
Did you say good-bye?

02:46:06.623 --> 02:46:09.558
Not exactly.

02:46:09.626 --> 02:46:13.187
I guess you have
your reasons.

02:46:13.263 --> 02:46:15.197
Yes.

02:46:21.404 --> 02:46:23.964
Now that we have a moment,

02:46:24.040 --> 02:46:28.033
would you mind if I expressed my
gratitude for what you did for Susan?

02:46:30.814 --> 02:46:35.513
I've never heard her speak of
any man as she spoke of you.

02:46:35.585 --> 02:46:38.611
That's what I always
wanted for her.

02:46:40.957 --> 02:46:43.858
But what happens
to her now?

02:46:45.128 --> 02:46:47.858
I wouldn't worry
about it, Bill.

02:46:47.931 --> 02:46:50.866
These things have a way
of working out.

02:46:54.270 --> 02:46:58.172
Would you mind if
I expressed my gratitude?

02:46:59.542 --> 02:47:02.272
For you,

02:47:02.345 --> 02:47:04.973
for the time
you've given me,

02:47:05.048 --> 02:47:07.243
for the person you are.

02:47:09.853 --> 02:47:14.517
Don't blow smoke up my ass.
You'll ruin my autopsy.

02:47:25.602 --> 02:47:28.196
It's hard to let go,
isn't it?

02:47:32.108 --> 02:47:34.099
Yes, it is, Bill.

02:47:36.212 --> 02:47:39.306
Well, that's life.

02:47:39.382 --> 02:47:41.907
What can I tell you?

02:48:16.286 --> 02:48:18.277
Should I be afraid?

02:48:20.256 --> 02:48:22.417
Not a man like you.

02:49:54.083 --> 02:49:56.017
You're here.

02:50:00.623 --> 02:50:02.591
You bet.

02:50:05.828 --> 02:50:08.296
Well, where did you go?

02:50:09.732 --> 02:50:13.133
I don't know.

02:50:13.203 --> 02:50:15.137
I don't...

02:50:20.043 --> 02:50:24.173
I... I don't know,
you know. I...

02:50:25.982 --> 02:50:30.783
It's all kind of blurred up
and hazy, but...

02:50:30.853 --> 02:50:35.847
Would you know what I mean if I said
I don't think I'll ever figure it out?

02:50:39.796 --> 02:50:41.991
But now I'm back.

02:50:47.103 --> 02:50:49.003
That's it?

02:50:53.309 --> 02:50:57.075
Well, I don't know what else to
say. Looks like a hell of a party.

02:51:00.016 --> 02:51:02.484
You think so?

02:51:04.954 --> 02:51:07.889
You look beautiful.

02:51:09.192 --> 02:51:11.660
When you disappeared
around the corner,

02:51:11.728 --> 02:51:16.688
I wasn't sure if I was
ever gonna see you again.

02:51:27.610 --> 02:51:29.601
Hey, are you all right?

02:51:38.454 --> 02:51:42.220
The coffee shop.
Yep.

02:51:42.292 --> 02:51:47.093
I asked you if I said something wrong and
you said no, it was so right it scared you.

02:51:47.163 --> 02:51:49.927
And then you said...

02:51:49.999 --> 02:51:55.301
Forgive me for saying this, but
it's been with me ever since.

02:51:58.441 --> 02:52:00.375
What has?

02:52:01.844 --> 02:52:03.971
You said you liked me.

02:52:07.784 --> 02:52:10.981
No.
You didn't?

02:52:12.522 --> 02:52:17.585
I said...
I liked you so much.

02:52:27.303 --> 02:52:29.931
Yeah.

02:52:30.006 --> 02:52:32.668
We know so little
about each other.

02:52:35.611 --> 02:52:37.943
But we've got time.

02:52:40.583 --> 02:52:42.517
Yeah.

02:52:51.728 --> 02:52:54.720
I wish you...

02:52:58.067 --> 02:53:00.865
could've known my father.

02:53:03.005 --> 02:53:05.405
Me too.

02:53:09.145 --> 02:53:11.079
Me too.

02:53:17.820 --> 02:53:19.754
What do we do now?

02:53:23.459 --> 02:53:25.893
It'll come to us.

02:53:27.230 --> 02:53:29.164
Yeah.

02:55:00.389 --> 02:55:03.449
<i>~ Somewhere ~</i>

02:55:03.526 --> 02:55:06.552

02:56:54.070 --> 02:56:58.700
<i>~ What a wonderful world ~</i>

02:57:01.043 --> 02:57:04.069
<i>~ Well, I see skies of blue ~</i>

02:57:04.146 --> 02:57:06.910
<i>~ And I see clouds of white ~</i>

02:57:06.983 --> 02:57:10.783
<i>~ And the brightness of day ~</i>

02:57:10.853 --> 02:57:12.787
<i>~ I like the dark ~</i>

02:57:12.855 --> 02:57:16.689
<i>~ And I think to myself ~</i>

02:57:16.759 --> 02:57:21.128
<i>~ What a wonderful world ~</i>

02:57:24.300 --> 02:57:27.064
<i>~ The colors of the rainbow ~</i>

02:57:27.136 --> 02:57:29.900
<i>~ So pretty in the sky ~</i>

02:57:29.972 --> 02:57:32.634
<i>~ Are also on the faces ~</i>

02:57:32.708 --> 02:57:35.268
<i>~ Of people passing by ~</i>

02:57:35.344 --> 02:57:37.835
<i>~ I see friends shaking hands ~</i>

02:57:37.913 --> 02:57:41.644
<i>~ Saying, how do you do ~</i>

02:57:41.717 --> 02:57:44.151
<i>~ They're really saying ~</i>

02:57:44.220 --> 02:57:48.247
<i>~ I, I love you ~</i>

02:57:49.325 --> 02:57:52.055
<i>~ I hear babies cry ~</i>

02:57:52.128 --> 02:57:55.256
<i>~ And I watch them grow ~</i>

02:57:55.331 --> 02:57:58.596
<i>~ They'll learn much more ~</i>

02:57:58.668 --> 02:58:00.727
<i>~ Than we'll know ~</i>

02:58:00.803 --> 02:58:04.261
<i>~ And I think to myself ~</i>

02:58:04.340 --> 02:58:09.778
<i>~ What a wonderful world ~</i>

02:58:09.845 --> 02:58:11.779
<i>~ World ~</i>

02:58:11.847 --> 02:58:14.941
<i>~ Some day I wish upon a star ~</i>

02:58:15.017 --> 02:58:18.976
<i>~ Wake up where the clouds
are far behind ~</i>

02:58:20.756 --> 02:58:26.126
<i>~ Be where trouble melts
like lemon drops ~</i>

02:58:26.195 --> 02:58:28.755
<i>~ High above the chimney top ~</i>

02:58:28.831 --> 02:58:31.356
<i>~ That's where ~</i>

02:58:31.434 --> 02:58:34.631
<i>~ You'll find me, oh ~</i>

02:58:34.704 --> 02:58:37.537
<i>~ Somewhere ~</i>

02:58:37.606 --> 02:58:40.598
<i>~ Over the rainbow ~</i>

02:58:41.811 --> 02:58:44.905
<i>~ Way up high ~</i>

02:58:46.115 --> 02:58:51.576
<i>~ And the dreams
that you dare to ~</i>

02:58:51.654 --> 02:58:57.615
<i>~ Why, oh, why, can't I ~</i>

02:58:57.693 --> 02:59:00.161
<i>~ I ~</i>
