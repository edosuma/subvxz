WEBVTT

00:01.072 --> 00:02.273
PREVIOUSLY ON...

00:02.273 --> 00:05.076
SUSAN TRACKED DOWN THE WIFE
OF THE MAN SHE HELPED BURY

00:07.308 --> 00:09.040
I THINK YOU ADDED
AN EXTRA ZERO.

00:09.040 --> 00:10.381
I WANNA DO SOMETHING
TO HELP.

00:10.381 --> 00:14.045
LYNETTE ADJUSTED TO LIFE
WITHOUT TOM.

00:14.045 --> 00:15.246
LOTS OF THINGS LIKE THIS
ARE GOING TO HAPPEN.

00:15.246 --> 00:17.248
I HAVE TO BE ABLE
TO FIX THEM.

00:17.248 --> 00:20.291
MIKE STOPPED BEN
FROM MAKING A MISTAKE...

00:20.291 --> 00:22.393
ARE YOU CRAZY?
 WHO IS THIS GUY?

00:22.393 --> 00:24.255
SORRY, PAL, THE DEAL'S OFF.
HE'S NOT TAKING YOUR MONEY.

00:24.255 --> 00:27.398
THEN TOLD HIM SOMETHING
HE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT RENEE.

00:27.398 --> 00:29.230
IF SHE DIVORCED
A CRICKET PLAYER,

00:29.230 --> 00:31.402
I MIGHT RECOGNIZE THE NAME.
 IF SHE DIVORCED
A CRICKET PLAYER,

00:31.402 --> 00:34.105
SHE WOULDN'T HAVE GOTTEN
$12 MILLION.

00:34.105 --> 00:36.137
AND BREE'S FALLING OUT
WITH HER FRIENDS

00:37.408 --> 00:39.110
(man) CAN I BUY YOU
ANOTHER DRINK?

00:39.110 --> 00:41.272
YOU CAN BUY ME BREAKFAST.

00:45.346 --> 00:46.417
(Mary Alice) BREE VAN DE KAMP

00:46.417 --> 00:51.382
HAD ALWAYS ENJOYED
A STERLING REPUTATION.

00:51.382 --> 00:55.226
SHE WAS KNOWN FOR BEING KIND
TO STRANGERS

00:55.226 --> 01:01.262
AND FOR GREETING THEM
WITH A WARM WELCOME.

01:03.294 --> 01:07.238
SHE MADE SURE EVERY GUEST
FELT COMFORTABLE

01:07.238 --> 01:12.143
AND THAT NO PART OF HER HOME
WAS OFF-LIMITS.

01:14.105 --> 01:17.348
SHE NEVER HAD THE HEART
TO TURN ANYONE AWAY,

01:17.348 --> 01:22.113
BECAUSE NO MATTER HOW MANY
GUESTS SHE WAS HOSTING

01:22.113 --> 01:25.456
OR HOW LATE
SHE WAS ENTERTAINING,

01:25.456 --> 01:30.221
HER GENEROSITY KNEW NO BOUNDS.

01:30.221 --> 01:31.362
THAT WAS AMAZING.

01:31.362 --> 01:32.423
IT WAS NICE.

01:32.423 --> 01:35.095
(panting) AND UNEXPECTED.

01:35.095 --> 01:37.097
MM.

01:37.097 --> 01:40.100
AN HOUR AGO, WHEN I OFFERED
TO BUY YOU THAT GLASS OF WINE,

01:40.100 --> 01:42.273
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT
A GOOD INVESTMENT IT WOULD BE.

01:42.273 --> 01:45.176
I DON'T WASTE ANY TIME...

01:45.176 --> 01:47.308
(whispers)
WHEN I SEE SOMETHING I LIKE.

01:47.308 --> 01:48.309
DECISIVE.

01:48.309 --> 01:49.410
HMM.

01:52.183 --> 01:54.285
(alarm ringing)

01:54.285 --> 01:56.387
GET OUT.

01:56.387 --> 01:57.488
WHAT?

01:57.488 --> 02:01.492
AHEM. I MEAN... (chuckles)
IT'S TIME TO GO.

02:01.492 --> 02:06.257
UH... IT'S--IT'S--
IT'S 4:00 IN THE MORNING.

02:06.257 --> 02:08.359
YEAH, AND MY NEIGHBOR,
KAREN McCLUSKEY,

02:08.359 --> 02:10.130
STARTS HER DAY AT 5:00
WITH A POT OF COFFEE

02:10.130 --> 02:11.402
AND A SEAT
NEAR HER FRONT WINDOW.

02:11.402 --> 02:13.334
THIS IS MY ONLY CHANCE
TO GET YOU OUT OF HERE

02:13.334 --> 02:14.335
WITHOUT HER NOTICING.

02:14.335 --> 02:16.437
WHO CARES IF SHE NOTICES?

02:16.437 --> 02:19.210
I DO. I HAVE A CERTAIN
REPUTATION ON THIS STREET,

02:19.210 --> 02:23.274
AND I DON'T WANT TO BECOME
THE SUBJECT OF IDLE GOSSIP.

02:23.274 --> 02:25.145
NOW COME ON.

02:28.319 --> 02:31.282
WELL, UH... THANKS AGAIN.
THIS--THIS WAS TERRIFIC.

02:31.282 --> 02:33.224
AH, YES,
HERE ARE YOUR PANTS.

02:33.224 --> 02:37.188
THANKS. UH, REALLY LOVE
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

02:37.188 --> 02:39.230
AW, THAT'S SWEET.
DON'T FORGET YOUR JACKET.

02:39.230 --> 02:41.332
IT'S QUITE CHILLY OUT TONIGHT.

02:41.332 --> 02:43.364
MM.

02:43.364 --> 02:45.336
I'M SERIOUS.
LET'S DO THIS AGAIN.

02:45.336 --> 02:48.269
HOW ABOUT FRIDAY?

02:48.269 --> 02:49.300
OH, I'M AFRAID I'M BUSY.

02:49.300 --> 02:51.171
THURSDAY OR WEDNESDAY?

02:52.373 --> 02:54.174
CAN I AT LEAST
GET YOUR PHONE NUMBER

02:54.174 --> 02:56.277
OR YOUR LAST NAME?

02:56.277 --> 02:58.379
(sighs) YOU SEEM LIKE
A GOOD PERSON,

02:58.379 --> 02:59.510
SO I'M GONNA BE HONEST.

02:59.510 --> 03:02.453
I HAVE NO INTEREST IN
HAVING A RELATIONSHIP WITH YOU.

03:02.453 --> 03:05.316
WHY NOT?

03:05.316 --> 03:07.318
BECAUSE I AM PAST
THE POINT IN MY LIFE

03:07.318 --> 03:08.519
WHERE I HOPE EVERY DATE
WILL FLOWER

03:08.519 --> 03:11.222
INTO
A MEANINGFUL RELATIONSHIP.

03:11.222 --> 03:12.523
I HAVE HAD HUSBANDS
AND BOYFRIENDS,

03:12.523 --> 03:14.495
AND THEY'VE BROUGHT ME
NOTHING BUT HEARTBREAK AND PAIN.

03:14.495 --> 03:20.271
SO NOW ALL I WANT IS A BODY
IN MY BED AT NIGHT, BRIEFLY.

03:20.271 --> 03:22.473
SO THAT'S IT? YOU'RE JUST
GONNA KICK ME OUT?

03:22.473 --> 03:26.537
I AM SO SORRY.
WHERE ARE MY MANNERS?

03:28.309 --> 03:33.213
YES, BREE HAD ALWAYS ENJOYED
A STERLING REPUTATION...

03:33.213 --> 03:35.486
IT WAS LOVELY
HAVING SEX WITH YOU.

03:35.486 --> 03:37.518
HAVE A WONDERFUL DAY.

03:40.351 --> 03:58.339
AND SHE SAW NO REASON
THAT SHOULD CHANGE.

04:00.441 --> 04:05.245
THERE COMES A TIME
FOR RENOVATION...

04:06.547 --> 04:11.582
WHEN AN EAGER CHILD
LEARNS A NEW SKILL...

04:11.582 --> 04:19.459
WHEN A ROMANTIC EVENING
BECOMES AN UNSIGHTLY MESS...

04:19.459 --> 04:26.597
OR WHEN A DINNER PARTY
COMES TO AN UNEXPECTED END.

04:26.597 --> 04:31.472
BUT SOMETIMES THE ONLY THING
THAT NEEDS TO BE REMOVED...

04:32.643 --> 04:35.306
IS A MEMORY.

04:37.277 --> 04:38.649
SO BASICALLY I WANT
A WHOLE NEW LOOK--

04:38.649 --> 04:41.352
NEW FURNITURE, NEW PAINT,
YOU NAME IT.

04:41.352 --> 04:43.354
SO WE CAN GET RID OF EVERYTHING,

04:43.354 --> 04:45.456
INCLUDING THE VIRGIN MARY
AND HER KID?

04:45.456 --> 04:48.489
AH. NO, NO, NO, NO. MY FAITH
IS VERY IMPORTANT TO ME.

04:48.489 --> 04:50.521
NAME THREE APOSTLES.

04:52.323 --> 04:54.365
OKAY, FINE.
MOVE IT TO THE GUEST ROOM.

04:54.365 --> 04:56.497
HEY, CAN YOU GUYS GET THIS
ALL DONE IN TWO WEEKS?

04:56.497 --> 04:58.629
PROBABLY. WHY THE RUSH?

04:58.629 --> 05:00.431
THAT'S WHEN CARLOS IS DONE
WITH REHAB.

05:00.431 --> 05:01.632
I DON'T WANT HIM COMING BACK
INTO THE ROOM.

05:01.632 --> 05:02.673
IT JUST FREAKS HIM OUT.

05:02.673 --> 05:05.305
WHY WOULD THIS ROOM
FREAK HIM OUT?

05:07.408 --> 05:10.411
'CAUSE IT WAS WHERE
CELIA WAS CONCEIVED,

05:10.411 --> 05:14.415
AND FRANKLY, THAT KID'S BEEN
NOTHING BUT TROUBLE. (chuckles)

05:14.415 --> 05:16.517
UH, SO, LYNETTE,
IS TOM BACK FROM PARIS?

05:16.517 --> 05:18.649
NOT YET.
JANE ARRANGED FOR THEM...

05:18.649 --> 05:20.320
(imitates British accent)
TO POP OVER TO LONDON

05:20.320 --> 05:21.422
FOR A COUPLE DAYS.

05:21.422 --> 05:22.623
(sighs) THAT SLUT.

05:22.623 --> 05:24.555
I'M SORRY.
 NO, NO, NO.

05:24.555 --> 05:25.696
I MEAN, YEAH, SHE'S A SLUT,

05:25.696 --> 05:29.460
BUT I'M DONE FEELING SORRY
FOR MYSELF.

05:29.460 --> 05:31.502
IT'S THE KICK IN THE PANTS
I NEED TO START DATING AGAIN.

05:31.502 --> 05:34.435
GOOD FOR YOU.
 YEAH, IT'S A BIG STEP.

05:34.435 --> 05:36.567
I KNOW, WHICH IS WHY I'M HOPING
YOU TWO MIGHT KNOW SOMEONE

05:36.567 --> 05:39.410
YOU COULD SET ME UP WITH.

05:40.541 --> 05:43.414
UH, SURE.
WE WILL THINK ABOUT IT.

05:43.414 --> 05:44.615
WHAT WAS THAT?

05:44.615 --> 05:46.577
WHAT WAS WHAT?

05:46.577 --> 05:48.379
WHAT WAS THAT LOOK THING
YOU JUST DID?

05:49.450 --> 05:52.352
OH. THERE IT IS.
YOU DID IT AGAIN.

05:52.352 --> 05:55.726
IT... LYNETTE,
YOU'RE A WONDERFUL PERSON.

05:55.726 --> 05:58.629
YOU ARE STRONG AND SEXY
AND SMART,

05:58.629 --> 06:02.563
SO... FIXING YOU UP
WOULD BE A BIT OF A CHALLENGE.

06:02.563 --> 06:03.634
WHY?

06:03.634 --> 06:08.469
WELL... BECAUSE
YOU'RE SO UNIQUE.

06:08.469 --> 06:10.571
SUCH AN ORIGINAL.

06:10.571 --> 06:14.705
FEISTY AND SO CERTAIN
OF WHAT YOU BELIEVE.

06:14.705 --> 06:17.408
STOP TRYING TO MAKE ALL THOSE
SOUND LIKE COMPLIMENTS.

06:17.408 --> 06:19.410
YOU'RE BASICALLY TELLING ME
I'M A BITCH.

06:21.452 --> 06:24.515
(gasps) OH, MY GOD!

06:24.515 --> 06:28.459
(sighs) WE'RE JUST SAYING
IT TAKES A CERTAIN KIND OF MAN

06:28.459 --> 06:30.661
TO APPRECIATE ALL YOU HAVE
TO OFFER.

06:30.661 --> 06:32.463
PREFERABLY ONE
WITH A HIDE LIKE A RHINO

06:32.463 --> 06:35.466
AND THE FIGHTING SPIRIT
OF A BABY HARP SEAL.

06:35.466 --> 06:37.498
OKAY, SO WE'RE DONE
SUGARCOATING?

06:37.498 --> 06:40.431
OKAY, LOOK, I'VE MET ME.

06:40.431 --> 06:42.503
I KNOW I CAN COME ON
A LITTLE STRONG,

06:42.503 --> 06:44.435
BUT I HAVE TO BELIEVE THERE'S
A GUY OUT THERE SOMEWHERE

06:44.435 --> 06:46.637
THAT FINDS THAT APPEALING.

06:48.609 --> 06:52.412
AND... YOU TWO ARE
GONNA HELP ME FIND THAT GUY.

06:52.412 --> 06:54.414
OHH, FINE. YOU WIN.

06:54.414 --> 06:59.419
YOU ALWAYS DO,
BECAUSE YOU'RE SO... FEISTY.

07:01.522 --> 07:05.496
(knock on door)

07:05.496 --> 07:06.497
(knocking continues)

07:06.497 --> 07:08.459
(gasps) OH, MY GOD.

07:08.459 --> 07:09.800
AAH! OH, MY GOD!

07:09.800 --> 07:12.763
WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?!
DIDN'T THE ALARM GO OFF?

07:12.763 --> 07:15.466
YEAH, AT 4:00 IN THE MORNING.
I SHUT IT OFF.

07:15.466 --> 07:17.568
NO, THAT'S WHEN YOU LEAVE.
THAT'S WHEN ALL THE MEN LEAVE.

07:17.568 --> 07:18.569
IT'S THE RULE.

07:18.569 --> 07:19.740
(pounding on door)

07:19.740 --> 07:21.441
OKAY, I'LL GET RID
OF WHOEVER'S KNOCKING,

07:21.441 --> 07:23.744
AND YOU CAN SNEAK
OUT THE BACK. STAY PUT.

07:23.744 --> 07:25.646
YEAH, BUT I HAVE--
 SHH!

07:25.646 --> 07:27.447
(whispers) AND DON'T MOVE.

07:28.619 --> 07:31.552
KAREN, HI.

07:31.552 --> 07:32.753
TH-THIS IS NOT A GOOD TIME.

07:32.753 --> 07:34.825
I AM SO ANGRY, I COULD SPIT.

07:34.825 --> 07:37.628
YOU'VE GOTTA HELP ME, BREE.

07:37.628 --> 07:38.789
WITH WHAT?

07:38.789 --> 07:40.561
THE CHURCH BAKE SALE.

07:40.561 --> 07:43.564
EVERYONE KNOWS I MAKE
THE LEMON BARS,

07:43.564 --> 07:46.537
BUT THIS YEAR, HELEN SIMPSON
SAYS SHE'S MAKING THEM, TOO,

07:46.537 --> 07:50.501
AND I CAN'T COMPETE WITH HER.
SHE USES REAL LEMONS.

07:50.501 --> 07:51.842
AND WHAT DO YOU USE?

07:51.842 --> 07:54.705
I'M ON A FIXED INCOME, OKAY?

07:54.705 --> 07:56.747
(gasps) OH, GOD!

07:58.849 --> 08:04.555
(sighs) I MEAN...
THAT MUST BE SO HARD FOR YOU.

08:04.555 --> 08:05.586
YOU'RE THE HEAD
OF THE WOMEN'S AUXILIARY.

08:05.586 --> 08:06.717
WHAT SHOULD I DO?

08:06.717 --> 08:10.791
HAVE YOU CONSIDERED
 COVERING YOUR LEMONS?

08:10.791 --> 08:11.822
WHAT?

08:11.822 --> 08:14.795
I-I MEAN, YOU HAVE
LEMON BARS COVERED,

08:14.795 --> 08:17.768
SO I'M GONNA ASK HELEN
TO MAKE BLUEBERRY CHEESECAKE.

08:17.768 --> 08:18.829
OKAY, THANKS.

08:18.829 --> 08:20.631
NOW OFF YOU GO.

08:20.631 --> 08:23.534
I WILL. I'M JUST WAITING
FOR THE NAKED GUY BEHIND ME

08:23.534 --> 08:26.577
TO FINISH GETTING DRESSED.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.840
SORRY. COULDN'T WAIT.

08:29.840 --> 08:32.783
I'VE GOT A MEETING.
HAVE YOU SEEN MY PANTS?

08:32.783 --> 08:34.885
UH, YOU LEFT THEM
ON THE KITCHEN ISLAND.

08:41.592 --> 08:44.725
DON'T GIVE ME
THE JUDGMENTAL EYEBROW.

08:44.725 --> 08:46.757
HE IS A DEAR OLD FRIEND
OF MINE

08:46.757 --> 08:48.599
VISITING FROM OUT OF TOWN.

08:48.599 --> 08:49.860
SEE YOU LATER, DAN.

08:49.860 --> 08:51.602
DON. HI.

08:51.602 --> 08:53.533
JUST GO.

08:55.566 --> 08:57.738
NOW CAN I GIVE YOU
THE EYEBROW?

08:57.738 --> 09:01.612
FINE. I MET HIM LAST NIGHT
AT MURRAY'S.

09:01.612 --> 09:03.614
MY CAR BROKE DOWN, AND I--

09:03.614 --> 09:05.676
I WENT INSIDE
TO WAIT FOR A TOW TRUCK.

09:05.676 --> 09:07.818
AND HOW ABOUT THE GUY
I SAW LEAVING THE OTHER MORNING?

09:07.818 --> 09:09.880
MY GOD.
WHAT TIME ARE YOU GETTING UP?

09:09.880 --> 09:12.583
CAUGHT THAT ONE
ON THE WAY TO THE CAN.

09:12.583 --> 09:14.554
WHAT IS GOING ON, BREE?

09:14.554 --> 09:17.628
YOU DON'T SEEM... YOURSELF
LATELY.

09:17.628 --> 09:19.890
I AM ABSOLUTELY FINE.

09:23.834 --> 09:27.638
OKAY. WHATEVER YOU SAY.

09:33.874 --> 09:35.676
(sighs)

09:35.676 --> 09:37.948
COME ON.

09:37.948 --> 09:39.780
WHAT IS YOUR BIG SURPRISE?

09:39.780 --> 09:41.752
JUST A FEW MORE FEET.

09:41.752 --> 09:43.614
BECAUSE IF IT'S A 3-WAY,
I GOTTA WARN YOU,

09:43.614 --> 09:44.915
THAT'S HOW I MET
MY EX-HUSBAND.

09:44.915 --> 09:48.719
UH, NO, IT'S NOT THAT.

09:48.719 --> 09:51.591
YOUR FISH.

09:51.591 --> 09:52.723
YOU'RE GETTING RID OF IT?

09:52.723 --> 09:54.725
WELL, I KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU HATE IT.

09:54.725 --> 09:56.667
WELL, IT MEANT SO MUCH
TO YOU...

09:56.667 --> 09:58.929
FOR SOME STUPID-ASS REASON
YOU ONCE EXPLAINED TO ME.

09:58.929 --> 09:59.930
YEAH.

09:59.930 --> 10:01.932
BRUCE AND I HAD SOME
GOOD TIMES TOGETHER.

10:01.932 --> 10:03.774
BUT YOU AND I HAVE BEEN
HAVING OUR SHARE, TOO,

10:03.774 --> 10:06.807
AND, UH, YOU KNOW,
IF I HAVE TO PICK ONE OF YOU

10:06.807 --> 10:09.640
FOR THE LONG HAUL, WELL...

10:09.640 --> 10:12.883
THE LONG HAUL?
WHAT ARE YOU TRYING TO SAY?

10:12.883 --> 10:14.915
I'M TRYING TO SAY...

10:14.915 --> 10:17.948
I WANT YOU TO COME
TO DINNER TOMORROW NIGHT.

10:17.948 --> 10:20.951
AH. SOUNDED LIKE THERE WAS
MORE TO IT THAN THAT.

10:20.951 --> 10:22.753
WELL, MAYBE THERE IS,

10:22.753 --> 10:25.756
BUT YOU'LL HAVE TO COME
TO DINNER TO FIND OUT.

10:25.756 --> 10:28.699
SOUNDS INTRIGUING.

10:28.699 --> 10:29.960
WE'RE NOT HAVING SWORDFISH,
ARE WE?

10:29.960 --> 10:33.834
(cell phone rings)

10:33.834 --> 10:35.706
(sighs) WORK.

10:35.706 --> 10:36.907
I WILL BE UPSTAIRS.

10:36.907 --> 10:38.709
MM-HMM.

10:40.640 --> 10:41.812
KEEP IT SHORT.

10:45.846 --> 10:46.847
(beep)

10:46.847 --> 10:48.979
HEY, CARL. WHAT'S UP?

10:48.979 --> 10:52.652
NO, NO, DON'T SEND OUT
THE LAYOFF NOTICES.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.825
WE'LL MAKE PAYROLL.
I'VE GOT THIS COVERED.

10:55.956 --> 10:57.988
NO, NOT THE BANK.

10:57.988 --> 11:01.932
I'M WORKING ON SOMETHING ELSE.

11:01.932 --> 11:03.794
(whirring)

11:03.794 --> 11:05.936
(pounding on door)

11:05.936 --> 11:08.839
(turns off vacuum cleaner)

11:09.940 --> 11:10.971
CLAUDIA.

11:10.971 --> 11:12.002
WHERE THE HELL
IS MY HUSBAND?

11:12.002 --> 11:14.044
(gasps)

11:14.044 --> 11:16.977
(pounding)

11:18.048 --> 11:21.051
OH, HEY, I'M SORRY.
THE DOOR SLIPPED.

11:21.051 --> 11:23.814
WHOA. OKAY. I JUST VACUUMED,
SO IF YOU COULD--

11:23.814 --> 11:25.756
RAMON!

11:25.756 --> 11:26.787
RAMON!

11:26.787 --> 11:29.720
HE ISN'T HERE.
H-HOW DID YOU FIND ME?

11:29.720 --> 11:30.991
YOUR ADDRESS WAS
ON THE CHECK, GENIUS.

11:30.991 --> 11:34.725
WHEN I FIND YOU, I'M GONNA
WRING YOUR NECK LIKE A CHICKEN!

11:34.725 --> 11:38.068
YOU SEEM A LITTLE TENSE. DO--
DO YOU WANT SOME HERBAL TEA?

11:38.068 --> 11:40.030
I WANT MY HUSBAND!

11:40.030 --> 11:43.003
WHAT MAKES YOU THINK
I KNOW WHERE HE IS?

11:43.003 --> 11:44.975
YOU TOLD MY DAUGHTER
HE WAS NEVER COMING BACK.

11:44.975 --> 11:47.908
YOU THINK IT'S THAT EASY
TO STEAL MY MAN, BITCH?

11:47.908 --> 11:51.812
WAIT. YOU THINK THAT I'M HAVING
AN AFFAIR WITH RAMON?

11:51.812 --> 11:52.983
DID HE GIVE THESE TO YOU?

11:52.983 --> 11:56.887
NO! NO! THESE ARE
FROM MY HUSBAND.

11:56.887 --> 11:59.049
SO YOU'RE CHEATING ON
YOUR HUSBAND, TOO. YOU WHORE.

11:59.049 --> 12:01.922
OKAY, LOOK, I SWEAR
THERE IS NO POSSIBLE WAY

12:01.922 --> 12:04.995
I COULD BE HAVING AN AFFAIR
WITH YOUR HUSBAND. TRUST ME.

12:04.995 --> 12:06.797
WELL, I THINK YOU'RE LYING.

12:06.797 --> 12:08.799
AND YOU WANNA SEE
WHAT I DO TO LIARS?

12:10.000 --> 12:12.763
HEY, MOM. WHO'S THAT?

12:12.763 --> 12:13.864
(whispers) PLEASE DON'T.

12:16.867 --> 12:18.839
YOU'RE THE HOME WRECKER,
NOT ME.

12:18.839 --> 12:20.811
BUT THIS ISN'T OVER.

12:22.773 --> 12:24.074
(door slams)

12:27.017 --> 12:29.749
(sighs)

12:35.355 --> 12:38.288
I WANNA GET TO THE CARPET STORE
BEFORE IT CLOSES.

12:38.288 --> 12:39.359
OH, RELAX.
IT'S A BLOCK AWAY.

12:39.359 --> 12:40.530
JUST NEED TO CONFIRM
MY APPOINTMENT.

12:40.530 --> 12:43.463
HI. MAKING SURE
I'M STILL ON WITH FRANK

12:43.463 --> 12:45.495
2:00 THURSDAY,
AND REMINDING YOU WHAT HAPPENED

12:45.495 --> 12:48.298
THE LAST TIME YOU SCREWED UP
MY APARTMENT.

12:48.298 --> 12:50.540
SHE HASN'T FORGOTTEN, RENEE.
NONE OF US HAVE.

12:50.540 --> 12:52.803
(laughs) HELLO. MWAH.
 MWAH.

12:52.803 --> 12:55.405
HOW ARE YOU?
THIS IS MY FRIEND LYNETTE.

12:55.405 --> 12:56.506
HI.

12:56.506 --> 13:00.350
WOW. WHO'S THE LUCKY GUY
DOING YOU?

13:00.350 --> 13:03.453
ACTUALLY...

13:03.453 --> 13:05.515
NOBODY. MY HUSBAND AND I
ARE SEPARATED,

13:05.515 --> 13:07.787
AND HE JUST TOOK HIS GIRLFRIEND
TO LONDON AND--

13:07.787 --> 13:09.559
HE WAS TALKING ABOUT YOUR HAIR.

13:09.559 --> 13:12.823
(gasps)
OH, OF COURSE YOU WERE.

13:12.823 --> 13:14.424
(chuckles)

13:14.424 --> 13:17.367
I'M GONNA MEET YOU
AT THE CARPET STORE.

13:17.367 --> 13:19.529
SERIOUSLY,
YOUR HAIR IS AMAZING.

13:19.529 --> 13:21.431
ANY CHANCE YOU'D EVER
LET ME STYLE YOU?

13:21.431 --> 13:23.573
UH, WELL, I'VE BEEN GOING
TO GUSTAVE ON MAIN FOR YEARS.

13:23.573 --> 13:25.836
I'D FEEL LIKE I WAS
CHEATING ON HIM.

13:25.836 --> 13:28.839
WELL, HE DOESN'T HAVE TO KNOW.

13:28.839 --> 13:30.810
(chuckles)

13:30.810 --> 13:32.843
YEAH, BUT...

13:32.843 --> 13:35.415
GUSTAVE IS JEALOUS
AND FRENCH,

13:35.415 --> 13:37.417
AND I WOULDN'T WANT THIS
ENDING UP

13:37.417 --> 13:40.420
A PISTOLS-AT-DAWN
KIND OF THING.

13:40.420 --> 13:43.393
LOYALTY.
JUST MAKES ME WANT YOU MORE.

13:43.393 --> 13:46.296
ALL RIGHT.
STOP SNIFFING EACH OTHER.

13:46.296 --> 13:48.528
I NEED
A BOTTLE OF CONDITIONER.

13:48.528 --> 13:49.559
COMING RIGHT UP.

13:52.502 --> 13:54.504
(lowered voice)
WELL, HE SEEMS GREAT.

13:54.504 --> 13:56.436
WHY DON'T YOU SET ME UP
WITH HIM?

13:56.436 --> 13:58.568
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

13:58.568 --> 14:00.510
WHY NOT?
YOU SAW HE WAS FLIRTING.

14:00.510 --> 14:01.841
WELL, NO,
HE'S NOT RIGHT FOR YOU.

14:01.841 --> 14:03.373
HE JUST GOT DIVORCED,

14:03.373 --> 14:05.445
AND HE'S NOT LOOKING
FOR ANYTHING SERIOUS.

14:05.445 --> 14:06.616
NEITHER AM I. IT'S PERFECT.

14:06.616 --> 14:09.479
HONEY, YOU'RE ABOUT TO GO
ON YOUR FIRST DATE IN 20 YEARS.

14:09.479 --> 14:12.382
I REALLY DON'T WANNA SEE YOU
GET HURT.

14:12.382 --> 14:15.455
DON'T WORRY ABOUT ME.
I'M FEISTY, REMEMBER?

14:15.455 --> 14:17.387
NO.

14:17.387 --> 14:20.430
DON'T MAKE ME USE
THE BABY VOICE.

14:20.430 --> 14:22.362
OH, NOT THE BABY VOICE.

14:22.362 --> 14:23.533
(baby voice) PWEASE.

14:23.533 --> 14:26.336
I EVEN HATE WHEN BABIES
USE THE BABY VOICE.

14:26.336 --> 14:32.472
PWEASE, WENEE, HELP WYNETTE
 DATE THE BIG, SEXY HAIR DWESSER.

14:32.472 --> 14:33.543
PWEASE.
 OKAY, OKAY.

14:33.543 --> 14:35.545
OKAY. OH, THANKS.

14:35.545 --> 14:37.377
HI.
 (chuckles)

14:37.377 --> 14:39.910
LOOK, LYNETTE MAY BE LOYAL
TO HER HAIRDRESSER,

14:39.910 --> 14:41.651
BUT SHE IS SINGLE.

14:41.651 --> 14:43.383
SO MAYBE THE TWO OF--

14:43.383 --> 14:46.416
I'D LOVE TO.
HOW ABOUT TONIGHT?

14:46.416 --> 14:47.887
SOUNDS GREAT.

14:47.887 --> 14:50.490
LEAVE YOUR NUMBER WITH LINDA.
I'LL CALL YOU WHEN I'M DONE.

14:50.490 --> 14:52.592
GREAT. THANK YOU.

14:55.595 --> 14:59.469
TO THANK YOU, I WILL NEVER
AGAIN DO THE BABY VOICE.

14:59.469 --> 15:00.670
AN, I APPRECIATE IT.

15:00.670 --> 15:02.402
(imitates British accent)
BUT I'VE STILL GOT

15:02.402 --> 15:03.603
THE BRITISH ONE.

15:03.603 --> 15:06.906
PIP, PIP, CHEERIO,
JOLLY OL' CRUMPETS AND TEA,

15:06.906 --> 15:08.908
LET'S GO. TA-TA.

15:10.580 --> 15:13.643
(sighs)

15:20.490 --> 15:21.621
OH, MY GOD.

15:26.926 --> 15:29.429
OH, MY GOD!

15:31.461 --> 15:33.563
WHY CAN'T WE WALK TO THE BUS
BY OURSELVES?

15:33.563 --> 15:34.704
ALL OF OUR FRIENDS DO.

15:34.704 --> 15:37.537
I'M NOT TRUSTING YOU WITH CELIA.
REMEMBER YOUR GERBIL?

15:37.537 --> 15:38.708
I WAS YOUNGER THEN.

15:38.708 --> 15:42.572
I DIDN'T KNOW HOW
TO MAKE A PARACHUTE YET.

15:42.572 --> 15:43.643
OKAY, FINE. GO.

15:43.643 --> 15:44.674
SERIOUSLY?

15:44.674 --> 15:46.516
YEAH. WALK, RUN. WHATEVER.

15:46.516 --> 15:48.618
QUICK,
BEFORE SHE CHANGES HER MIND!

15:58.528 --> 16:00.590
SUSAN!

16:00.590 --> 16:02.692
...AND THAT'S WHEN I DECIDED
TO FLY TO OKLAHOMA CITY

16:02.692 --> 16:03.963
AND VISIT THEM.

16:03.963 --> 16:05.435
UNBELIEVABLE.

16:05.435 --> 16:07.467
AND I OBVIOUSLY DIDN'T HAVE
$1,000 CASH,

16:07.467 --> 16:08.598
SO I HAD TO WRITE A CHECK.

16:08.598 --> 16:10.640
WITH YOUR ADDRESS ON IT.
PERFECT.

16:10.640 --> 16:13.573
AND I WAS HOPING THAT
WHEN SHE CALMED DOWN,

16:13.573 --> 16:16.476
SHE WOULD REALIZE
WE WEREN'T HAVING AN AFFAIR.

16:16.476 --> 16:17.677
APPARENTLY NOT.

16:17.677 --> 16:19.479
I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU WOULD GO TO HIS FAMILY.

16:19.479 --> 16:21.451
WHY WOULD YOU DO THAT?

16:21.451 --> 16:23.713
I FELT SO GUILTY.
OH, IT WAS EATING ME UP.

16:23.713 --> 16:25.485
THE GUILT AGAIN?

16:25.485 --> 16:26.716
YOU FEEL GUILTY,
SO YOU ASSAULT A COP.

16:26.716 --> 16:28.658
YOU FEEL GUILTY,
SO YOU PAINT THE MURDER SCENE.

16:28.658 --> 16:30.590
YOU FEEL GUILTY,
SO YOU GO TO HIS HOUSE?

16:30.590 --> 16:32.522
WHEN IS THIS GONNA END?

16:32.522 --> 16:35.525
I JUST NEEDED TO MAKE SURE
THEY WERE OKAY.

16:35.525 --> 16:36.596
YOU KNOW,
 THEY DIDN'T DO ANYTHING.

16:36.596 --> 16:38.028
SUSAN, WE WERE IN THE CLEAR.

16:38.028 --> 16:40.600
THERE WAS NOBODY WHO COULD
CONNECT HIM TO US,

16:40.600 --> 16:42.532
AND THEN YOU HAD TO GO
TELL HIS WIFE--

16:42.532 --> 16:44.634
NO, NO, NO, HIS WIDOW--

16:44.634 --> 16:46.776
HE WAS NEVER COMING BACK.

16:46.776 --> 16:48.478
(papers rustling)

16:48.478 --> 16:50.710
I DIDN'T TELL CLAUDIA.
I TOLD MARISA.

16:50.710 --> 16:52.642
WHO THE HELL IS MARISA?

16:52.642 --> 16:55.014
HIS 15-YEAR-OLD STEPDAUGHTER.

16:59.018 --> 17:00.590
WAIT. YOU TALKED TO HER?

17:02.752 --> 17:05.595
DO YOU THINK HE WAS...

17:12.632 --> 17:14.503
WELL, HOW DO YOU KNOW?
DID SHE TELL YOU?

17:18.808 --> 17:21.570
SHE DIDN'T HAVE TO.

17:21.570 --> 17:26.576
I'VE ONLY SEEN THAT LOOK
IN SOMEONE'S EYES ONCE BEFORE--

17:26.576 --> 17:28.548
YOURS.

17:32.782 --> 17:34.784
(sighs)

17:34.784 --> 17:36.586
DO YOU THINK SHE'S TOLD
HER MOTHER?

17:36.586 --> 17:41.531
IT DIDN'T SEEM
LIKE SHE TOLD ANYONE.

17:43.693 --> 17:46.566
SHE NEEDS TO.

17:46.566 --> 17:50.540
KEEPING A SECRET LIKE THAT--
IT JUST... TEARS YOU UP.

17:53.543 --> 17:55.745
I'M SO SORRY. I...

17:55.745 --> 17:59.809
I DON'T KNOW HOW WE'RE GONNA
GET OUT OF THIS ONE.

18:03.082 --> 18:06.556
I DO.

18:06.556 --> 18:08.718
CALL CLAUDIA AND TELL HER
I WANNA TALK TO HER.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.692
WHO DO I SAY YOU ARE?

18:14.864 --> 18:17.797
THE WOMAN'S WHO GONNA TELL HER
THE TRUTH ABOUT HER HUSBAND.

18:26.636 --> 18:29.539
(piano playing,
indistinct conversations)

18:29.539 --> 18:32.342
SO... WHAT'S YOUR FEELING
ON CARPACCIO?

18:32.342 --> 18:33.643
MY FEELING IS I'D LIKE
TO BE LOCKED

18:33.643 --> 18:37.387
INSIDE A ROOM MADE OF CARPACCIO
AND EAT MY WAY OUT.

18:37.387 --> 18:38.548
(both chuckle)

18:38.548 --> 18:40.590
I AM SO HAPPY TO HEAR YOU
SAY THAT.

18:40.590 --> 18:42.392
MY EX NEVER LET ME ORDER
ANYTHING RAW

18:42.392 --> 18:44.624
WITHOUT GIVING ME A LECTURE
ABOUT THE DANGERS OF E. coli.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.526
UGH. SEXY.

18:46.526 --> 18:48.558
(chuckles)

18:48.558 --> 18:50.660
I'M SORRY. I SHOULDN'T
BE TALKING ABOUT HER.

18:50.660 --> 18:52.502
NO, IT'S NICE TO HEAR

18:52.502 --> 18:54.504
ABOUT SOMEONE ELSE'S
MARRIAGE PROBLEMS FOR A CHANGE.

18:54.504 --> 18:55.635
OH, THERE WAS NO PROBLEM,

18:55.635 --> 18:58.508
AS LONG AS WE DID EVERYTHING
EXACTLY HER WAY.

18:58.508 --> 19:00.340
AH.

19:00.340 --> 19:02.442
"WHY DO YOU HAVE TO WORK
FOR SOMEBODY ELSE?

19:02.442 --> 19:04.374
WHY DON'T YOU GET
YOUR OWN SALON?"

19:04.374 --> 19:06.476
I CAN SEE HOW THAT
WOULD BE FRUSTRATING.

19:08.348 --> 19:11.521
ALTHOUGH...

19:11.521 --> 19:12.652
I SUPPOSE
SOMEONE COULD ARGUE

19:12.652 --> 19:14.624
THAT SHE WAS JUST
TRYING TO HELP YOU.

19:14.624 --> 19:18.428
HELP ME? BY MAKING ME FEEL
LIKE A FAILURE ALL THE TIME?

19:18.428 --> 19:22.362
YEAH, THAT IS PRETTY AWFUL.

19:22.362 --> 19:23.433
ALTHOUGH...

19:23.433 --> 19:28.468
MAYBE SHE MEANT IT
AS A MOTIVATIONAL TECHNIQUE.

19:28.468 --> 19:30.340
SO YOU AGREE WITH HER?

19:30.340 --> 19:32.342
I AM JUST TRYING
TO UNDERSTAND

19:32.342 --> 19:33.473
WHAT SHE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
THINKING.

19:33.473 --> 19:37.377
I MEAN, YOU DON'T WANNA BE
A STYLIST FOREVER, RIGHT?

19:37.377 --> 19:38.548
WHY NOT?

19:38.548 --> 19:40.550
(chuckles) BECAUSE...

19:40.550 --> 19:42.582
WHO WANTS TO BE CUTTING HAIR
WHEN THEY'RE 60?

19:42.582 --> 19:44.614
I MEAN, WOULDN'T YOU RATHER BE
CHECKING IN ON YOUR OWN SALON

19:44.614 --> 19:46.656
FROM A BEACH IN BALI?

19:46.656 --> 19:48.718
I LIKE CUTTING HAIR.

19:48.718 --> 19:51.691
THEN THAT IS
ALL THAT MATTERS.

19:54.624 --> 19:57.397
ALTHOUGH...

19:59.569 --> 20:03.433
MY GOODNESS,
YOU CERTAINLY DO WORK OUT.

20:03.433 --> 20:06.536
I JUST LOVE A MAN
WITH A FIRM BICEP.

20:06.536 --> 20:08.738
YOU WANT TO FEEL MINE?

20:08.738 --> 20:11.511
REVEREND SYKES,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

20:11.511 --> 20:13.743
THE MORE PERTINENT QUESTION IS,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

20:13.743 --> 20:17.447
WELL... AS YOU ALWAYS SAY,

20:17.447 --> 20:18.648
THERE'S NO POINT
IN PREACHING TO THE CHOIR.

20:18.648 --> 20:20.490
YOU'VE GOTTA GO
OUT INTO THE WORLD

20:20.490 --> 20:23.723
AND... TRY TO SET THE YOUTH
ON A DIFFERENT PATH.

20:23.723 --> 20:26.556
I THINK YOUR PATH
SHOULD TAKE YOU ELSEWHERE,

20:26.556 --> 20:27.757
PERHAPS TO ONE
OF THOSE LADIES

20:27.757 --> 20:30.400
NOT SO BURDENED DOWN
WITH CLOTHING.

20:32.562 --> 20:35.535
I CAN ONLY IMAGINE
WHAT YOU MUST THINK.

20:35.535 --> 20:39.469
OH, WHAT I THINK IS,
AS KAREN McCLUSKEY PUT IT,

20:39.469 --> 20:41.411
"YOU'RE BACK
ON THE YAHOO JUICE."

20:41.411 --> 20:42.512
OH, THAT'S NOT MINE.

20:42.512 --> 20:45.415
SOME POOR SOUL WHO WAS HERE
BEFORE ME MUST HAVE LEFT IT.

20:54.684 --> 20:58.728
I SUPPOSE I HAVE ALLOWED MYSELF
TO SLIP BACK INTO SOME...

20:58.728 --> 20:59.759
OLD HABITS.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.461
WELL, THAT'S WHY I'M HERE,

21:01.461 --> 21:02.762
TO KEEP YOU FROM SLIPPING
ANY FURTHER,

21:02.762 --> 21:06.536
SO GATHER UP YOUR THINGS
AND LET'S GO.

21:06.536 --> 21:08.768
YOU MUST BE SO DISAPPOINTED
IN ME.

21:08.768 --> 21:10.770
IT'S ALL RIGHT, BREE.
I'VE BEEN YOUR PASTOR FOR YEARS,

21:10.770 --> 21:12.702
AND YOU'RE THE MOST PROPER
AND APPROPRIATE WOMAN

21:12.702 --> 21:14.444
I'VE EVER COME ACROSS.

21:14.444 --> 21:15.575
THIS IS OBVIOUSLY
A TEMPORARY LAPSE

21:15.575 --> 21:19.509
AND NOT WHO YOU TRULY ARE.

21:19.509 --> 21:22.682
HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?
 EXCUSE ME?

21:22.682 --> 21:25.715
HOW CAN YOU SAY WHO I TRULY AM
WHEN I DON'T EVEN KNOW MYSELF?

21:25.715 --> 21:28.718
WE CAN DISCUSS THIS LATER.
NOW COME ON. FOLLOW ME.

21:28.718 --> 21:30.520
BUT I HAVE BEEN
FOLLOWING YOU FOR YEARS,

21:30.520 --> 21:33.493
AND I AM STILL TERRIBLY LOST.

21:33.493 --> 21:35.525
I NEED TO FIND OUT
WHO I REALLY AM,

21:35.525 --> 21:40.470
AND I THINK... MAYBE THE PLACE
I NEED TO SEARCH IS RIGHT HERE.

21:40.470 --> 21:45.475
YOU DO REALIZE,
IF YOU CONTINUE TO DO THIS,

21:45.475 --> 21:48.478
I CAN NO LONGER LET YOU
LEAD THE WOMEN'S AUXILIARY.

21:48.478 --> 21:51.841
YOU CAN'T DO THAT.
THE BAKE SALE IS THIS SUNDAY.

21:51.841 --> 21:53.843
IT WOULD BE A DISASTER
WITHOUT ME.

21:53.843 --> 21:57.517
I'M LOOKING AT A MUCH BIGGER
DISASTER RIGHT HERE.

21:57.517 --> 21:59.589
NOW YOU'RE JUST BEING CRUEL.

21:59.589 --> 22:01.751
THAT'S NOT VERY MINISTERIAL
OF YOU.

22:01.751 --> 22:03.593
I DIDN'T ONLY COME HERE
AS YOUR MINISTER.

22:03.593 --> 22:06.626
I ALSO CAME AS YOUR FRIEND.

22:06.626 --> 22:09.699
BUT CLEARLY, YOU HAVE
NO INTEREST IN EITHER RIGHT NOW.

22:19.739 --> 22:20.810
SO AS YOU CAN SEE,

22:20.810 --> 22:23.743
WITHIN TWO YEARS
OF OPENING THE SALON,

22:23.743 --> 22:26.576
YOU WILL HAVE AMORTIZED
ALL THE START-UP COSTS.

22:26.576 --> 22:27.817
UH, WE ARE NOT READY YET.

22:27.817 --> 22:29.719
AT THAT POINT,
THERE'S NO REASON

22:29.719 --> 22:31.681
YOU COULDN'T CONSISTENTLY
TURN A PROFIT.

22:31.681 --> 22:33.683
OH, MY GOD.

22:33.683 --> 22:35.525
CAN WE TALK
ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE?

22:35.525 --> 22:37.827
I'M JUST TRYING TO HELP.
FROM WHAT RENEE TELLS ME,

22:37.827 --> 22:39.689
PEOPLE GO TO THE SALON
BECAUSE OF YOU,

22:39.689 --> 22:41.831
AND YET HALF THAT MONEY--
YOUR MONEY--

22:41.831 --> 22:43.593
IS GOING TO THE OWNER.

22:43.593 --> 22:45.835
SERIOUSLY, THIS IS MAKING
MY STOMACH HURT.

22:45.835 --> 22:47.837
COULD IT BE
'CAUSE YOU'RE SCARED?

22:47.837 --> 22:50.800
HOW COULD YOU SAY THAT?
YOU KNOW NOTHING ABOUT ME.

22:50.800 --> 22:53.773
I KNOW. I KNOW. IT'S JUST...
WE'VE SPENT AN HOUR

22:53.773 --> 22:56.546
COMING UP WITH A PERFECTLY
REASONABLE 5-YEAR PLAN,

22:56.546 --> 22:58.608
AND IT JUST MAKES
YOUR STOMACH HURT.

22:58.608 --> 23:01.751
YOU KNOW WHO ELSE
HAD A 5-YEAR PLAN? STALIN.

23:04.754 --> 23:10.820
OKAY. OH, I'M SORRY
I SAID ANYTHING.

23:10.820 --> 23:12.562
(sighs)

23:12.562 --> 23:14.564
YOU'RE HAPPY WHERE YOU ARE.
THAT'S GREAT.

23:14.564 --> 23:16.626
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG
WITH BEING AVERAGE.

23:16.626 --> 23:18.768
I AM NOT AVERAGE.

23:18.768 --> 23:20.900
I'M SORRY. ADEQUATE,
SETTLED, COMFORTABLE.

23:20.900 --> 23:22.572
WHATEVER YOU WANNA CALL IT.

23:22.572 --> 23:23.773
WHY DON'T WE JUST ORDER?

23:23.773 --> 23:24.904
GOOD IDEA.

23:30.680 --> 23:31.781
OH, THE SALMON LOOKS GOOD.

23:31.781 --> 23:34.714
AT A STEAKHOUSE?

23:34.714 --> 23:36.846
YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M SURE
IT'S PERFECTLY ADEQUATE--

23:36.846 --> 23:38.618
SETTLED, COMFORTABLE.

23:44.624 --> 23:46.596
I DON'T KNOW WHAT BEN
HAS UP HIS SLEEVE,

23:46.596 --> 23:47.857
BUT IT'S GONNA BE
A SPECIAL NIGHT,

23:47.857 --> 23:51.861
SO I REALLY WANNA
LOOK GREAT.

23:51.861 --> 23:53.663
SPEAKING OF WHICH,

23:53.663 --> 23:55.935
HOW WAS YOUR, UH, BIG DATE
WITH LYNETTE?

23:55.935 --> 23:58.838
AH! (chuckles) LITTLE TIGHT.

23:58.838 --> 24:00.810
SORRY.
 OH.

24:00.810 --> 24:02.872
THE DATE WAS INTERESTING.

24:02.872 --> 24:05.875
I REALLY OWE YOU ONE.

24:05.875 --> 24:08.648
(gasps)

24:08.648 --> 24:09.779
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR HAIR?

24:13.983 --> 24:16.786
FRANK WAS THE ONE GUY
IN THIS PODUNK TOWN

24:16.786 --> 24:18.958
WHO KNEW HOW TO RELAX
A BLACK WOMAN'S HAIR.

24:18.958 --> 24:21.961
NOW I LOOK LIKE AN EXTRA
FROM "FOXY BROWN."

24:21.961 --> 24:24.864
AND THANKS TO YOU,
OUR RELATIONSHIP IS RUINED.

24:24.864 --> 24:26.796
WAIT. FRANK DID THAT?

24:26.796 --> 24:28.938
I HAD NO IDEA
OUR DATE WAS THAT BAD.

24:28.938 --> 24:29.999
OH, REALLY?

24:29.999 --> 24:32.902
DID YOU OR DID YOU NOT
GIVE HIM A 5-YEAR PLAN

24:32.902 --> 24:34.744
ON A COCKTAIL NAPKIN?!

24:34.744 --> 24:37.877
WELL, I MAY HAVE MADE
A FEW CONSTRUCTIVE SUGGESTIONS,

24:37.877 --> 24:39.979
BUT ONLY BECAUSE I SAW
POTENTIAL IN THE GUY.

24:39.979 --> 24:42.812
HE COULD REALLY
 BE SOMETHING.

24:42.812 --> 24:45.715
HE IS SOMETHING,
AND HE LIKES WHO HE IS.

24:45.715 --> 24:47.957
HE DOESN'T NEED YOU TELLING HIM
THAT IT ISN'T GOOD ENOUGH.

24:47.957 --> 24:50.820
I AM NOT GOING TO APOLOGIZE
FOR TRYING TO HELP THE GUY.

24:50.820 --> 24:52.892
IF HE CAN'T HANDLE IT,
THAT'S HIS PROBLEM.

24:52.892 --> 24:54.924
AH, I SEE.

24:54.924 --> 24:57.897
SO IT'S HIS FAULT
YOU TRIED TO CONTROL HIM?

24:57.897 --> 25:01.671
JUST LIKE IT WAS TOM'S FAULT
YOU TRIED TO CONTROL HIM?

25:01.671 --> 25:05.675
WHAT DID BOTH OF THOSE GUYS
HAVE IN COMMON?

25:05.675 --> 25:08.808
OH, WAIT. GIVE ME A SECOND.
UH, I'LL THINK OF IT.

25:08.808 --> 25:09.909
I'D SAY PUT
ON A THINKING CAP,

25:09.909 --> 25:11.841
BUT I DON'T THINK
THERE'S ONE BIG ENOUGH.

25:11.841 --> 25:13.813
WELL, AT LEAST I CAN
COVER UP THIS MESS.

25:13.813 --> 25:16.015
THAT ONE IS GONNA TAKE
A HELL OF A LOT MORE WORK.

25:18.918 --> 25:21.821
(door opens and closes)

25:23.753 --> 25:25.755
COME ON.
TAKE OFF THE SCARF.

25:25.755 --> 25:26.956
(chuckles)
HOW BAD COULD IT BE?

25:26.956 --> 25:31.731
YOU'D BE SURPRISED.
I LOOK LIKE A BOTTLE BRUSH.

25:31.731 --> 25:33.833
SO WHAT'S
THE BIG OCCASION HERE?

25:33.833 --> 25:36.906
FIRST, A TOAST.

25:36.906 --> 25:38.868
TO THE WOMAN WHO CAME
ROARING INTO MY LIFE

25:38.868 --> 25:39.969
LIKE A ONE-EYED WOMBAT.

25:41.711 --> 25:42.912
UH, IT'S A GOOD THING.

25:42.912 --> 25:44.974
A FORCE WHO MAKES EACH DAY

25:44.974 --> 25:47.917
MORE EXCITING
AND SURPRISING THAN THE LAST.

25:47.917 --> 25:49.819
(clink)

25:51.751 --> 25:53.783
(swallows) AHH.
 MMM.

25:53.783 --> 25:56.055
NOW... I REALIZE
IT'S ONLY BEEN A FEW MONTHS,

25:56.055 --> 25:58.928
BUT, UH...

25:58.928 --> 26:01.731
I FOUND MYSELF
FALLING FOR YOU, RENEE.

26:03.062 --> 26:08.067
AND, UH... I KNOW A KEEPER
WHEN I SEE ONE.

26:08.067 --> 26:10.740
OH, BEN.

26:10.740 --> 26:11.741
(glass clatters)

26:11.741 --> 26:12.842
YOU LIKE IT?

26:12.842 --> 26:14.974
I LOVE IT.
 YEAH?

26:14.974 --> 26:17.877
IT'S JUST... IT'S SO FAST.

26:17.877 --> 26:19.809
WELL, IF YOU NEED TO TAKE
YOUR TIME, I UNDER--

26:19.809 --> 26:22.051
NO, NO, I DON'T NEED
TO TAKE MY TIME. YES!

26:22.051 --> 26:23.753
I'LL MARRY YOU!

26:23.753 --> 26:25.054
(both laugh)

26:25.054 --> 26:27.056
OHH.

26:27.056 --> 26:31.090
YOU HAVE MADE ME SO HAPPY.

26:31.090 --> 26:35.895
OHH. YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'VE DONE FOR ME.

26:35.895 --> 26:38.898
WHEN MY... MARRIAGE ENDED,

26:38.898 --> 26:40.129
I FELT SO BETRAYED.

26:40.129 --> 26:43.132
I DECIDED I WOULD NEVER
TRUST ANYONE AGAIN.

26:43.132 --> 26:46.105
(voice breaking)
AND THEN YOU CAME ALONG.

26:46.105 --> 26:49.038
(sighs)

26:49.038 --> 26:50.940
I JUST FEEL SO SAFE
WITH YOU

26:50.940 --> 26:53.843
IN A WAY
THAT I'VE NEVER FELT BEFORE.

26:56.115 --> 26:58.147
AND I KNOW THAT...

26:58.147 --> 27:01.821
IN MY HEART THIS IS RIGHT.

27:04.153 --> 27:06.125
(sighs)

27:07.927 --> 27:09.098
I CAN'T DO THIS.

27:10.960 --> 27:12.061
WHAT?

27:12.061 --> 27:14.003
JUST FORGET I SAID ANYTHING,
OKAY?

27:14.003 --> 27:16.005
FORGET YOU ASKED ME
TO MARRY YOU?

27:16.005 --> 27:17.166
WHAT? GIVE ME THE RING.

27:17.166 --> 27:20.009
YOU DON'T WANNA MARRY ME, RENEE.
I'M AN AWFUL PERSON.

27:20.009 --> 27:22.111
YOU'RE AN AMAZING PERSON.

27:22.111 --> 27:23.873
NOW SLIDE IT ON RIGHT THERE.

27:23.873 --> 27:25.014
I CAN'T.
 WHY?

27:25.014 --> 27:26.876
WHAT IS GOING ON?

27:26.876 --> 27:29.078
OH, GOD.
YOU'RE GONNA HATE ME FOR THIS.

27:33.923 --> 27:35.955
I'M HAVING SOME
FINANCIAL PROBLEMS,

27:35.955 --> 27:37.987
AND...

27:37.987 --> 27:41.891
I GUESS I THOUGHT IF WE POOLED
OUR RESOURCES, THAT... OH.

27:43.192 --> 27:45.194
YOU WANTED TO MARRY ME
FOR MY MONEY?

27:45.194 --> 27:47.166
I KNOW.

27:47.166 --> 27:48.968
I'M SORRY.

27:52.842 --> 27:54.103
WOW.

27:54.103 --> 27:57.076
(sighs)

27:57.076 --> 27:59.108
LOOK, RENEE...

28:01.150 --> 28:04.013
I MEANT EVERY WORD I SAID.

28:04.013 --> 28:05.855
I DO LOVE YOU.

28:05.855 --> 28:11.120
THERE'S REALLY NO WAY FOR ME
TO KNOW THAT NOW, IS THERE?

28:22.932 --> 28:24.904
(sighs heavily)

28:32.181 --> 28:33.883
HI, CLAUDIA.

28:33.883 --> 28:35.945
I'M GABY. THANKS FOR COMING.

28:35.945 --> 28:38.147
YEAH. THIS ONE SAID
YOU WANTED TO TALK TO ME?

28:38.147 --> 28:39.889
WHAT ABOUT?

28:42.892 --> 28:45.024
WE SHOULD GO INSIDE.

28:48.097 --> 28:50.159
YOU'RE NOT COMING?
 NO.

28:50.159 --> 28:52.031
I'M--I'M GONNA WAIT OUT HERE.

28:52.031 --> 28:56.165
I THINK YOU TWO COULD PROBABLY
USE SOME PRIVACY.

29:07.847 --> 29:10.119
IT'S NOT USUALLY THIS MESSY
IN HERE. WE'RE REDECORATING.

29:10.119 --> 29:11.981
EXCUSE ME, MRS. SOLIS?
DO YOU HAVE A SECOND?

29:11.981 --> 29:13.122
WHAT--WHAT IS THAT?

29:16.886 --> 29:19.028
RED WINE.
NEW YEAR'S EVE PARTY.

29:19.028 --> 29:20.930
WE WERE PLAYING...
SMASH-THE-BOTTLE,

29:20.930 --> 29:22.131
WHICH IS A TERRIBLE GAME.

29:22.131 --> 29:24.193
OKAY. UH, WE'RE TAKING LUNCH.

29:24.193 --> 29:26.896
JUST WANTED TO GIVE YOU
A HEADS-UP BEFORE WE REPLACE IT.

29:26.896 --> 29:31.070
GREAT! GREAT. DON'T NEED ANY
REMINDERS OF THAT CRAZY NIGHT.

29:31.070 --> 29:33.903
(sighs) CAN I GET YOU
SOMETHING TO DRINK?

29:33.903 --> 29:35.875
NO. YOU CAN TELL ME
WHAT THE HELL I'M DOING HERE.

29:35.875 --> 29:36.946
WHERE'S RAMON?

29:36.946 --> 29:40.209
WELL... HOW TO START THIS...

29:43.212 --> 29:46.986
FIRST OF ALL,
THE MAN YOU'RE LOOKING FOR--

29:46.986 --> 29:49.058
HIS REAL NAME
IS ALEJANDRO PEREZ.

29:49.058 --> 29:50.990
WHAT?

29:50.990 --> 29:53.122
NO, IT'S NOT.

29:53.122 --> 29:55.224
TRUST ME.

29:55.224 --> 29:57.226
I KNEW HIM
BEFORE HE EVER MET YOU.

29:59.128 --> 30:00.199
HOW?

30:00.199 --> 30:03.903
HE WAS MY STEPFATHER.

30:10.239 --> 30:11.240
HI.

30:13.943 --> 30:15.084
YOU OKAY?

30:15.084 --> 30:17.116
I JUST WANT ALL THIS
TO BE OVER.

30:17.116 --> 30:19.919
ME, TOO.

30:19.919 --> 30:22.021
BUT IT'S NEVER
GOING TO END.

30:22.021 --> 30:26.255
SHE WON'T STOP LOOKING FOR HIM.
SHE STILL LOVES HIM.

30:26.255 --> 30:29.929
SO YOU DIDN'T TELL HER?

30:29.929 --> 30:31.931
NO WAY.

30:31.931 --> 30:33.232
SHE WOULD NEVER BELIEVE ME.

30:33.232 --> 30:36.265
DID YOU TELL ANYONE?

30:39.108 --> 30:40.169
NO.

30:40.169 --> 30:44.273
MARISA, I'M NOT GONNA
PRETEND TO UNDERSTAND

30:44.273 --> 30:46.175
WHAT YOU'RE DEALING WITH.

30:46.175 --> 30:48.978
BUT I HAVE A FRIEND
WHO WENT THROUGH THE SAME THING,

30:48.978 --> 30:54.323
AND SHE SAID
THAT AS AWFUL AS IT WAS,

30:54.323 --> 30:58.988
KEEPING THE SECRET
ONLY MAKES IT WORSE.

31:03.032 --> 31:05.164
SO IF HE LEFT YOU
AND YOUR MOM,

31:05.164 --> 31:08.237
CHANGED HIS NAME,
STARTED A WHOLE NEW LIFE,

31:08.237 --> 31:10.099
WHY'D HE COME BACK
TO SEE YOU?

31:10.099 --> 31:14.143
I HAD VISITED MY HOMETOWN.
I SAID SOME THINGS ABOUT HIM.

31:14.143 --> 31:16.105
HE HEARD,
AND HE WANTED ME TO STOP.

31:16.105 --> 31:18.047
WHAT KIND OF THINGS?

31:18.047 --> 31:19.979
(sighs)

31:19.979 --> 31:21.250
LOOK, THIS ISN'T EASY
FOR ME--

31:21.250 --> 31:23.082
WHAT KIND OF THINGS?

31:25.114 --> 31:27.116
WHEN I WAS 15,
HE MOLESTED ME.

31:29.158 --> 31:30.289
(scoffs)

31:33.062 --> 31:34.293
(scoffs)

31:34.293 --> 31:36.295
YOU EXPECT ME
TO BELIEVE THAT?

31:36.295 --> 31:39.328
I WAS A VIRGIN,
AND HE HURT ME.

31:39.328 --> 31:41.070
LIAR.

31:41.070 --> 31:42.371
CLAUDIA.

31:42.371 --> 31:45.004
I KNOW THIS IS HARD
TO HEAR.

31:45.004 --> 31:46.305
I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU
AND YOUR FRIEND DID.

31:46.305 --> 31:48.137
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED TO MY HUSBAND.

31:48.137 --> 31:50.279
ALL I KNOW IS EVERYTHING
I'M BEING TOLD IS A LIE.

31:50.279 --> 31:53.012
IT'S NOT!
HE WAS A CHILD MOLESTER.

31:53.012 --> 31:56.185
SHUT UP! YOU CAN MAKE IT SOUND
AS BAD AS YOU WANT.

31:56.185 --> 31:58.247
YOU CAN TELL ALL THE DISGUSTING
LIES YOU CAN THINK OF.

31:58.247 --> 32:01.050
I WILL NEVER BELIEVE YOU.

32:01.050 --> 32:02.391
(Marisa, voice breaking)
THEN BELIEVE ME.

32:05.254 --> 32:07.256
WHAT?

32:09.258 --> 32:12.061
I WAS TOO SCARED
TO TELL YOU.

32:12.061 --> 32:14.033
I KNOW HOW MUCH
YOU LOVE HIM.

32:14.033 --> 32:16.165
(voice breaking) OH, MY GOD.

32:16.165 --> 32:17.306
ARE YOU SAYING...

32:17.306 --> 32:19.368
I KEPT THINKING
IT WOULD STOP.

32:19.368 --> 32:21.370
(crying)

32:21.370 --> 32:25.244
NO. (crying) NO.

32:25.244 --> 32:28.117
(both sobbing)

32:28.117 --> 32:29.178
NOT MY BABY.

32:29.178 --> 32:31.180
NO.

32:31.180 --> 32:33.322
(sobbing)

32:33.322 --> 32:35.084
NO.

32:45.594 --> 32:48.397
IT IS ALL MY FAULT.

32:48.397 --> 32:51.300
(sighs)

32:51.300 --> 32:52.401
COME IN.

32:57.446 --> 32:58.547
YOU WERE RIGHT.

32:58.547 --> 33:00.279
ALL THOSE YEARS,
I THOUGHT I PUSHED TOM

33:00.279 --> 33:02.281
BECAUSE HE NEEDED ME TO.

33:02.281 --> 33:03.482
WELL, HE DID.

33:03.482 --> 33:05.484
NO, HE DIDN'T,
AND THAT GUY WASN'T TOM.

33:05.484 --> 33:07.586
HE WAS JUST
A PERFECTLY LOVELY GUY,

33:07.586 --> 33:09.518
PERFECTLY CONTENT
WITH HIS LIFE

33:09.518 --> 33:12.361
UNTIL HURRICANE LYNETTE
HIT HIM.

33:12.361 --> 33:14.393
AT LEAST YOU RECOGNIZE IT.

33:14.393 --> 33:16.365
THEY ALWAYS SAY
THAT'S THE FIRST STEP.

33:16.365 --> 33:18.627
MM, CAN I TELL YOU THE TRUTH?
THERE WAS A PART OF ME

33:18.627 --> 33:21.630
THAT RECOGNIZED IT
THE WHOLE TIME.

33:21.630 --> 33:24.573
A LITTLE VOICE INSIDE MY HEAD
TELLING ME,

33:24.573 --> 33:27.536
"YOU LIKE THIS GUY, AND YOU'RE
DRIVING HIM NUTS. STOP."

33:27.536 --> 33:30.409
BUT I COULDN'T.

33:30.409 --> 33:33.482
WHAT IF AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,
I CAN'T STOP?

33:33.482 --> 33:36.645
WHAT IF THIS IS WHO I AM?

33:36.645 --> 33:41.350
REMEMBER IN COLLEGE
YOU USED TO BITE YOUR NAILS?

33:41.350 --> 33:42.521
YOU STOPPED THAT.

33:42.521 --> 33:45.424
YEAH, BY TAKING UP SMOKING.

33:45.424 --> 33:47.496
REMEMBER HOW
YOU QUIT SMOKING?

33:47.496 --> 33:49.398
YOGA.

33:49.398 --> 33:50.599
I'VE NEVER SEEN YOU
MORE RELAXED

33:50.599 --> 33:52.501
THAN WHEN YOU WERE TAKING
THOSE CLASSES.

33:52.501 --> 33:54.433
I DON'T KNOW.

33:54.433 --> 33:55.634
ALL I'M SAYING IS

33:55.634 --> 33:58.437
YOU ARE THE MOST DETERMINED
PERSON I KNOW.

33:58.437 --> 34:00.409
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING
YOU WANT.

34:00.409 --> 34:01.670
I JUST WANNA BE DIFFERENT.

34:01.670 --> 34:06.445
I'M SICK OF BEING
THIS HYPERCRITICAL NUT JOB.

34:06.445 --> 34:09.447
IT'LL GET BETTER.

34:09.447 --> 34:11.580
TRUST ME.
AND SO WILL DATING.

34:11.580 --> 34:13.581
YOU WILL FIND SOMEBODY.

34:13.581 --> 34:17.525
I HOPE YOU'RE RIGHT.

34:17.525 --> 34:20.359
I MEAN, HELL,
IF YOU FOUND BEN...

34:23.362 --> 34:25.634
I'M JOKING. I'M JOKING.

34:25.634 --> 34:27.366
UM... (sighs)

34:27.366 --> 34:29.467
BEN AND I...

34:29.467 --> 34:31.600
(sighs)

34:31.600 --> 34:33.402
IT'S OVER.

34:33.402 --> 34:35.674
OH.

34:35.674 --> 34:37.476
(sighs)

34:47.386 --> 34:48.456
HEY.

34:48.456 --> 34:50.719
SO THAT'S WHERE
THE TOUGH GUY LIVES, HUH?

34:53.362 --> 34:54.663
CAN WE JUST DO
OUR BUSINESS, PLEASE?

34:54.663 --> 34:59.498
YOU PAY EVERY WEEK,
EVERYONE'S HAPPY.

34:59.498 --> 35:01.630
YOU MISS ONE,
IT'LL COST YOU.

35:01.630 --> 35:03.702
YOU MISS TWO...

35:03.702 --> 35:05.504
YOU DON'T WANNA MISS TWO.

35:05.504 --> 35:06.705
DON'T WORRY.
 (latches click)

35:06.705 --> 35:08.537
I JUST HAVE TO GET
PAST THIS ROUGH PATCH,

35:08.537 --> 35:10.739
AND THEN THE MONEY
WILL BE ROLLING IN.

35:10.739 --> 35:13.612
TAKE YOUR TIME. BESIDES,
IF YOU'RE NOT GOOD FOR IT,

35:13.612 --> 35:17.446
I UNDERSTAND THAT PRETTY
GIRLFRIEND OF YOURS IS LOADED.

35:17.446 --> 35:20.719
SHE'S GOT NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS.

35:20.719 --> 35:24.393
YOU KEEP HER OUT OF IT.
YOU UNDERSTAND ME?

35:24.393 --> 35:27.556
THERE'S A LOT OF TOUGH GUYS
ON THIS STREET.

35:35.704 --> 35:37.636
(sighs)

35:39.508 --> 35:40.769
HI! COME IN.

35:40.769 --> 35:42.471
WE'RE NOT STAYING.

35:42.471 --> 35:43.672
JUST... CAME TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

35:43.672 --> 35:45.444
AND THANK YOU.

35:45.444 --> 35:48.677
YOU SURE YOU DON'T WANNA STAY?
I HAVE A GUEST ROOM.

35:48.677 --> 35:50.649
NO, WE NEED TO BE GETTING BACK.

35:50.649 --> 35:53.622
THIS ONE'S MISSED ENOUGH SCHOOL
ALREADY.

35:53.622 --> 35:54.753
GIVE ME A SECOND, MIJA.

35:54.753 --> 35:56.755
MM.

36:09.768 --> 36:11.500
I STILL DON'T KNOW HOW
THIS COULD HAVE HAPPENED

36:11.500 --> 36:12.671
UNDER MY NOSE.

36:12.671 --> 36:14.803
YOU MUST THINK I'M
THE WORST MOTHER IN THE WORLD.

36:14.803 --> 36:17.646
NO.

36:17.646 --> 36:20.509
AT LEAST YOU BELIEVE HER.
MY MOTHER NEVER DID.

36:20.509 --> 36:21.810
(voice breaking) BUT I'M THE ONE
WHO BROUGHT THAT MAN

36:21.810 --> 36:23.582
INTO HER LIFE.

36:23.582 --> 36:26.455
YOU DIDN'T KNOW.
NOBODY EVER KNEW--

36:26.455 --> 36:29.788
WHAT A MONSTER HE WAS?
I KNOW NOW, THANKS TO YOU.

36:36.525 --> 36:39.628
YOU SAID THAT STAIN
WAS RED WINE?

36:41.570 --> 36:43.732
UH-HUH.

36:43.732 --> 36:47.606
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
GET RID OF THAT.

37:00.949 --> 37:02.451
(door closes)

37:32.281 --> 37:34.453
(clatter)

37:36.425 --> 37:37.926
(bottle clatters)

37:37.926 --> 37:39.458
(sighs)

37:49.498 --> 37:51.400
(sighs)

37:51.400 --> 37:54.403
(indistinct conversations)

38:01.009 --> 38:02.981
BREE, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

38:02.981 --> 38:04.953
OH, I'VE BEEN RUNNING
THIS BAKE SALE FOR EIGHT YEARS.

38:04.953 --> 38:06.455
WHY WOULDN'T I BE HERE?

38:06.455 --> 38:08.016
I TOLD EVERYONE
YOU WEREN'T FEELING WELL

38:08.016 --> 38:10.058
AND HAD DECIDED
TO SIT THIS ONE OUT.

38:10.058 --> 38:12.961
WELL, I'M FEELING BETTER NOW.

38:12.961 --> 38:16.995
BESIDES EVERY BAKE SALE
NEEDS... A TART.

38:16.995 --> 38:20.969
WHILE I APPRECIATE
A GOOD CULINARY DOUBLE ENTENDRE

38:20.969 --> 38:22.331
AS MUCH AS THE NEXT MAN,

38:22.331 --> 38:25.003
I REALLY DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD
BE HERE IN YOUR CONDITION.

38:25.003 --> 38:29.538
I'M FINE. LOOK HOW BEAUTIFULLY
MY DESSERT CAME OUT.

38:29.538 --> 38:32.411
SHORTCRUST PASTRY,
FRESH STRAWBERRIES--

38:32.411 --> 38:33.982
YOU'VE OBVIOUSLY
BEEN DRINKING.

38:33.982 --> 38:36.415
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO EMBARRASS YOURSELF.

38:36.415 --> 38:39.388
WELL, I APPRECIATE
YOUR CONCERN, REVEREND,

38:39.388 --> 38:41.520
BUT I CAN TAKE CARE
OF MYSELF.

38:45.023 --> 38:47.526
(mouths words)

38:47.526 --> 38:49.398
YOU'RE VERY WELCOME.

38:49.398 --> 38:51.530
TELL ARE YOUR FRIENDS
TO COME TO MY TABLE.

38:51.530 --> 38:55.534
ALL RIGHT, WHO'S NEXT?

38:55.534 --> 38:57.366
GREG.

38:57.366 --> 38:59.337
OH, MY GOD. BREE.

38:59.337 --> 39:00.469
WH-WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

39:00.469 --> 39:02.070
THIS IS MY CHURCH.

39:02.070 --> 39:03.572
ARE YOU A MEMBER? I'VE NEVER
SEEN YOU HERE BEFORE.

39:03.572 --> 39:07.045
I, UH, JUST JOINED. YES.
NICE TALKING TO YOU.

39:07.045 --> 39:08.517
WAIT, WAIT.

39:08.517 --> 39:10.449
CAN'T I TEMPT YOU
WITH A SLICE

39:10.449 --> 39:13.452
OF MY FAMOUS STRAWBERRY...
TART?

39:13.452 --> 39:15.424
I, UH, I SHOULD PROBABLY
GET GOING--

39:15.424 --> 39:17.085
WHAT A FUNNY COINCIDENCE
THIS WAS.

39:17.085 --> 39:20.058
WILL I SEE YOU
AT MURRAY'S LATER?

39:20.058 --> 39:22.060
OR... WE COULD JUST SKIP
THE MURRAY'S PART,

39:22.060 --> 39:24.593
AND YOU COULD COME...
(whispers) STRAIGHT TO MY HOUSE.

39:24.593 --> 39:28.136
GREG,
WHO IS THIS WOMAN?

39:28.136 --> 39:32.541
UH, THIS IS BREE. SHE, UM,
SHE GOES TO THIS CHURCH.

39:32.541 --> 39:34.603
DOESN'T SOUND LIKE YOU
MET HER IN CHURCH.

39:34.603 --> 39:38.046
EXCUSE ME. WHAT BUSINESS IS IT
OF YOURS HOW WE MET?

39:38.046 --> 39:39.377
I'M HIS WIFE.

39:39.377 --> 39:44.413
OH. I GUESS
IT IS YOUR BUSINESS.

39:44.413 --> 39:48.056
UNBELIEVABLE.

39:48.056 --> 39:51.159
YOU'RE ALWAYS GOING ON
ABOUT WORKING LATE

39:51.159 --> 39:53.492
AND SLEEPING IN THE OFFICE,
AND MEANWHILE,

39:53.492 --> 39:56.625
YOU'RE HANGING OUT
AT DIVE BARS PICKING UP TRASH.

39:58.497 --> 40:00.469
I DON'T LIKE
YOUR ACCUSATION.

40:00.469 --> 40:03.071
OH, YEAH?
GUESS WHAT I DON'T LIKE?

40:03.071 --> 40:05.073
YOU SCREWING MY HUSBAND!

40:05.073 --> 40:06.475
BREE, THIS IS WHAT
I WAS WORRIED ABOUT.

40:06.475 --> 40:08.106
YOU NEED TO LEAVE.

40:08.106 --> 40:11.610
YOU'RE KICKING ME OUT?
SHE'S THE ONE MAKING A SCENE,

40:11.610 --> 40:15.113
AND A DRY BATCH OF CUPCAKES,
BY THE LOOKS OF IT.

40:15.113 --> 40:17.546
THANKS, BUT I'M NOT LOOKING
FOR BAKING TIPS

40:17.546 --> 40:20.418
FROM THE TOWN WHORE.

40:20.418 --> 40:23.091
DON'T LISTEN TO HER, BREE.
SHE DOESN'T KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

40:27.556 --> 40:29.558
ACTUALLY, KAREN...

40:29.558 --> 40:31.630
I THINK SHE DOES.

40:37.435 --> 40:39.508
NOW I KNOW
YOU'RE ALL ANXIOUS TO DIG IN

40:39.508 --> 40:43.441
TO THE DELICIOUS GOSSIP
I'VE PROVIDED FOR YOU.

40:43.441 --> 40:46.444
AND I COULD REALLY USE A DRINK.

40:46.444 --> 40:49.447
TSK-TSK-TSK.

40:52.120 --> 40:55.524
YES, IN THE LIFE
OF EVERY HOUSEWIFE,

40:55.524 --> 41:00.158
THERE COMES A TIME
FOR RENOVATION.

41:00.158 --> 41:06.464
SHE MAY BE DOING AWAY
WITH AN UNPLEASANT MEMORY...

41:07.696 --> 41:12.200
BREAKING UP
A ONCE HAPPY RELATIONSHIP...

41:14.673 --> 41:21.149
OR MAKING THE NECESSARY CHANGES
TO PREPARE FOR A NEW ONE.

41:23.181 --> 41:25.614
BUT NO MATTER HOW MUCH
A HOUSEWIFE

41:25.614 --> 41:29.217
MAY EMBRACE THE WAY
HER LIFE IS CHANGING,

41:29.217 --> 41:32.621
THE PEOPLE IN HER NEIGHBORHOOD

41:32.621 --> 41:36.194
MAY TAKE A DIFFERENT VIEW.

41:36.194 --> 41:37.225
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

41:37.225 --> 41:39.698
MAYBE WE SHOULD, UH,
GO INSIDE.

41:42.230 --> 41:46.705
OR MAYBE WE SHOULDN'T.
