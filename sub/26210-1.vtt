WEBVTT

00:06.973 --> 00:08.041
The women's division

00:08.041 --> 00:10.677
of WWE has come a very long way.

00:10.677 --> 00:12.345
In 2013, the women

00:12.345 --> 00:13.413
didn't have a match.

00:13.413 --> 00:15.148
When are you guys going out?

00:15.148 --> 00:16.149
We got cut.

00:16.149 --> 00:16.983
The next year, we

00:16.983 --> 00:17.984
made our first appearance on the

00:17.984 --> 00:18.952
main stage.

00:18.952 --> 00:19.986
Having a

00:19.986 --> 00:20.987
WrestleMania moment.

00:20.987 --> 00:22.355
In 2016, the Divas

00:22.355 --> 00:23.524
division became the women's

00:23.524 --> 00:24.591
division.

00:24.591 --> 00:25.792
You will no longer

00:25.792 --> 00:27.861
be referred to as "Divas."

00:27.861 --> 00:31.064
You will simply be Superstars.

00:31.064 --> 00:32.698
The first‐ever

00:32.698 --> 00:36.069
women's championship.

00:36.069 --> 00:37.203
And a revolution was

00:37.203 --> 00:38.438
born.

We had the first‐ever

women's ladder match.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.001
The first‐ever

02:15.782 --> 02:17.751
That's gorgeous. Awesome.

02:17.751 --> 02:18.752
Cool. Okay.

02:18.752 --> 02:19.586
Well, I've been

02:19.586 --> 02:20.587
watching someone's storyline on

02:20.587 --> 02:22.088
TV, looks like someone might...

02:22.088 --> 02:23.089
Do you like it?

02:23.089 --> 02:23.824
Love it.

02:23.824 --> 02:25.191
It's so good, dude.

02:25.191 --> 02:28.061
Oh, my gosh. So good.

02:28.061 --> 02:30.664
And I love it, too, because, um,

02:30.664 --> 02:31.898
I like how they've really kept

02:31.898 --> 02:34.100
the multiple stories for women.

02:34.100 --> 02:35.636
Yes. Well then,

02:35.636 --> 02:37.137
Charlotte and Asuka with their

02:37.137 --> 02:37.838
singles.

02:37.838 --> 02:39.405
And then, possibly Lexi and me,

02:39.405 --> 02:40.373
and then the battle royal.

02:40.373 --> 02:41.241
Yeah.

02:41.241 --> 02:42.142
Right now, the women's

02:42.142 --> 02:43.810
division is killing it.

02:43.810 --> 02:45.712
At WrestleMania, we have two

02:45.712 --> 02:48.314
singles matches and I happen to

02:48.314 --> 02:50.016
be in one of those matches.

02:50.016 --> 02:51.017
And here is a

02:51.017 --> 02:52.052
woman who has a date at

02:52.052 --> 02:54.354
WrestleMania against a woman Nia

02:54.354 --> 02:56.289
thought was once her friend,

02:56.289 --> 02:57.724
Alexa Bliss.

02:57.724 --> 02:59.025
The closer and closer

02:59.025 --> 03:00.400
we get to WrestleMania, I'm

03:00.400 --> 03:02.202
just, I'm freaking out and I

03:02.202 --> 03:04.137
want to make sure that I‐I put

03:04.137 --> 03:05.171
on the best show that I possibly

03:05.171 --> 03:05.872
can.

03:05.872 --> 03:07.508
And then Ronda...

03:07.508 --> 03:08.542
And then Ronda.

03:08.542 --> 03:09.610
How has it been with

03:09.610 --> 03:10.711
Ronda at TV?

03:10.711 --> 03:12.513
Um, honestly, Ronda has

03:12.513 --> 03:13.514
been cool.

03:13.514 --> 03:15.816
She's so strong and she's so

03:15.816 --> 03:18.118
powerful and I think it's great.

03:18.118 --> 03:18.785
Yeah.

03:18.785 --> 03:19.920
It's interesting because she's

03:19.920 --> 03:21.154
definitely bringing attention to

03:21.154 --> 03:22.288
the division, but it's awesome

03:22.288 --> 03:23.323
to see that your storyline's

03:23.323 --> 03:24.658
still going strong to Mania.

03:24.658 --> 03:26.092
Ronda Rousey is a beast.

03:26.092 --> 03:27.493
She's on a different level.

03:27.493 --> 03:29.395
She just got signed to the WWE

03:29.395 --> 03:31.665
and I'm definitely nervous,

03:31.665 --> 03:33.166
hoping that what I have is good

03:33.166 --> 03:34.167
enough against somebody like

03:34.167 --> 03:35.035
Ronda Rousey.

03:35.035 --> 03:36.169
You're so stunning on

03:36.169 --> 03:36.837
camera.

03:36.837 --> 03:38.438
Oh, what?

03:38.438 --> 03:39.506
Got a new twin in town.

03:39.506 --> 03:40.507
Yes.

03:40.507 --> 03:42.643
Peace out, Brie. Sorry.

03:42.643 --> 03:43.977
See ya, bitch.

03:43.977 --> 03:46.246
Peace out.

03:46.246 --> 03:48.414
New tag partner.

03:48.414 --> 03:50.050
That's what sisters do.

What‐what?

04:06.172 --> 04:08.074
Look, there you are.

04:08.074 --> 04:09.075
Holy crud.

04:09.075 --> 04:10.243
My tit is literally

04:10.243 --> 04:11.645
out.

04:13.179 --> 04:14.414
How long has it been

04:14.414 --> 04:16.182
this way?

04:16.182 --> 04:17.750
Are you posting this right now?

04:17.750 --> 04:18.619
I hate you.

04:18.619 --> 04:21.654
I'm back, bitches.

04:21.654 --> 04:22.789
We're in New Orleans and I get

04:22.789 --> 04:24.290
to do commentary for

04:24.290 --> 04:25.659
WrestleMania.

04:25.659 --> 04:26.627
I don't know, I don't think

04:26.627 --> 04:27.628
you're loud enough, guys.

04:27.628 --> 04:28.629
You need to make some more

04:28.629 --> 04:30.163
noise.

04:30.163 --> 04:31.765
I made my debut here back in

04:31.765 --> 04:32.766
2014.

04:32.766 --> 04:33.900
Won the Divas championship,

04:33.900 --> 04:35.068
and now we're back again, four

04:35.068 --> 04:36.169
years later.

04:36.169 --> 04:37.370
It's kind of bittersweet 'cause

04:37.370 --> 04:38.738
I'm not gonna be wrestling due

04:38.738 --> 04:40.040
to injury.

04:40.040 --> 04:41.508
Her name is Paige,

04:41.508 --> 04:43.209
and she's here on <i>Raw.</i>

04:43.209 --> 04:44.344
Paige is looking to take

04:44.344 --> 04:45.345
advantage.

04:45.345 --> 04:46.680
And there‐‐ Oh!

04:46.680 --> 04:47.681
Paige‐Turner, she

04:47.681 --> 04:49.449
did it. Paige did it!

04:49.449 --> 04:51.451
We have a new champion.

04:51.451 --> 04:52.485
I kind of have a

04:52.485 --> 04:53.654
um, I have to

04:53.654 --> 04:55.221
give my retirement speech after

04:55.221 --> 04:56.523
WrestleMania.

04:56.523 --> 04:58.358
And I'm so sad.

04:58.358 --> 05:00.000
I made my debut here and now I

05:00.000 --> 05:02.035
have to make my retirement here.

05:02.035 --> 05:03.036
Oh, there's the

05:03.036 --> 05:04.838
Mercedes‐Benz Superdome.

05:04.838 --> 05:06.006
Dude, isn't it cool

05:06.006 --> 05:07.774
though, just, like, like, it

05:07.774 --> 05:09.242
gives me, like, it makes my

05:09.242 --> 05:10.376
heart beat, like, a little bit

05:10.376 --> 05:11.244
fast, just thinking about it for

05:11.244 --> 05:12.078
you; I'm just, like, super

05:12.078 --> 05:13.113
excited for you.

05:13.113 --> 05:14.080
Yeah. It's just a lot

05:14.080 --> 05:14.748
of pressure.

05:14.748 --> 05:16.449
It's just, I mean, obviously,

05:16.449 --> 05:18.418
Lexi, who's been my best friend

05:18.418 --> 05:20.186
since I got here‐‐ it's weird.

05:20.186 --> 05:21.487
It's cool, it's just...

05:21.487 --> 05:22.956
Dude, your match is

05:22.956 --> 05:24.090
gonna be incredible. Like...

05:24.090 --> 05:25.091
Ooh, I hope so.

05:25.091 --> 05:26.026
And you can walk away

05:26.026 --> 05:26.927
being like, "Hey, like, I made

05:26.927 --> 05:27.794
history today.

05:27.794 --> 05:29.029
I got to have a singles match

05:29.029 --> 05:30.130
on WrestleMania."

05:30.130 --> 05:31.197
A frickin' good one, 'cause I

05:31.197 --> 05:32.833
know you can, like, do that.

05:32.833 --> 05:35.201
Thank you.

05:35.201 --> 05:36.637
Dude! Thank you.

05:36.637 --> 05:37.771
I'm really glad that we've

05:37.771 --> 05:38.905
bonded.

05:38.905 --> 05:41.642
Let's get this week started.

05:41.642 --> 05:42.609
We have arrived.

05:42.609 --> 05:43.577
Yeah.

05:43.577 --> 05:44.410
Hey, what do you want

05:44.410 --> 05:45.145
to do right now?

05:45.145 --> 05:46.680
Do you want to go for food?

05:46.680 --> 05:47.914
We're in New Orleans, baby!

05:47.914 --> 05:48.649
No, I know.

05:48.649 --> 05:49.482
It's gonna be fun.

05:49.482 --> 05:50.250
But I seriously have to

05:50.250 --> 05:51.151
go and, like, get my hair stuff

05:51.151 --> 05:51.952
together.

05:51.952 --> 05:53.186
Like, my hair is falling out.

05:53.186 --> 05:54.187
Okay, well, you want

05:54.187 --> 05:55.421
to go do something afterwards

05:55.421 --> 05:56.590
then?

05:56.590 --> 05:57.824
Um, I'll hit you up if I

05:57.824 --> 05:58.892
can, for sure.

05:58.892 --> 05:59.826
Come on.

05:59.826 --> 06:00.801
I know.

06:00.801 --> 06:02.235
It's just a crazy, crazy day.

06:02.235 --> 06:03.269
Okay.

06:03.269 --> 06:04.037
You know?

06:04.037 --> 06:04.871
Let me know

06:04.871 --> 06:05.672
afterwards.

06:05.672 --> 06:06.607
I'll go have fun for the both of

06:06.607 --> 06:07.340
us right now.

06:07.340 --> 06:08.408
Do it for the both of

06:08.408 --> 06:10.010
us, sis.

06:18.084 --> 06:19.085
Oh, my gosh, baby

06:19.085 --> 06:21.688
girl.

06:21.688 --> 06:22.889
It is WrestleMania week

06:22.889 --> 06:24.625
and we are in New Orleans.

06:24.625 --> 06:26.593
Everyone's so excited.

06:26.593 --> 06:27.928
This is the biggest event of the

06:27.928 --> 06:29.530
year and it's just really

06:29.530 --> 06:31.965
exciting to be a part of this.

06:35.201 --> 06:36.202
What up, though?

06:36.202 --> 06:37.437
We're about to go

06:37.437 --> 06:38.438
swamping and we're gonna go to

06:38.438 --> 06:39.573
dinner and we're gonna go on a

06:39.573 --> 06:40.574
girls' date.

06:40.574 --> 06:41.441
Oh, you've just got

06:41.441 --> 06:42.342
it all mapped out for us today,

06:42.342 --> 06:43.343
huh?

06:43.343 --> 06:44.177
Yeah, baby girl, I am

06:44.177 --> 06:45.111
not doing much this week and I

06:45.111 --> 06:47.080
just wanted to have a touristy

06:47.080 --> 06:48.114
shared experience with

06:48.114 --> 06:49.149
everybody.

06:49.149 --> 06:50.450
Of course Paige will

06:50.450 --> 06:51.585
pick us up straight from the

06:51.585 --> 06:52.786
airport and take us on a swamp

06:52.786 --> 06:53.820
tour.

06:53.820 --> 06:54.921
I have never been on a swamp

06:54.921 --> 06:56.456
tour, but...

06:56.456 --> 06:57.691
first time for everything,

06:57.691 --> 06:58.692
right?

06:58.692 --> 06:59.760
So, they're saying as

06:59.760 --> 07:01.434
of now, you can't wrestle.

07:01.434 --> 07:02.435
No. No, I can't

07:02.435 --> 07:03.504
wrestle again.

07:03.504 --> 07:05.038
Dr. Uribe was like, you can have

07:05.038 --> 07:07.207
this surgery, get the‐the screws

07:07.207 --> 07:08.509
taken out and then have rods in

07:08.509 --> 07:09.776
your neck like TJ.

07:09.776 --> 07:10.777
It had to take a long

07:10.777 --> 07:12.145
time to heal because of his

07:12.145 --> 07:13.379
injury but he's loving his role

07:13.379 --> 07:14.380
as a producer.

07:14.380 --> 07:15.381
He's doing a great

07:15.381 --> 07:16.382
job, though, dude, like,

07:16.382 --> 07:17.417
everyone gets super excited if

07:17.417 --> 07:19.152
they're like, he's the producer.

07:19.152 --> 07:20.286
He loves to come back

07:20.286 --> 07:21.421
and tell me after he's finished

07:21.421 --> 07:22.556
with Raw how great the girls are

07:22.556 --> 07:23.924
doing and how much he loves them

07:23.924 --> 07:25.358
all.

07:25.358 --> 07:27.260
Paige is a star, Mandy's a star,

07:27.260 --> 07:28.328
everybody's a star.

07:28.328 --> 07:29.596
It's like, tell me that I'm,

07:29.596 --> 07:30.831
like, just tell me that I did

07:30.831 --> 07:31.832
good tonight.

07:31.832 --> 07:32.799
It's like, with us girls, it's

07:32.799 --> 07:33.767
like don't screw with us.

07:33.767 --> 07:34.735
When we're right, we're right,

07:34.735 --> 07:35.702
and when we're wrong, we're

07:35.702 --> 07:36.903
still right.

07:36.903 --> 07:38.171
Exactly.

07:42.275 --> 07:43.243
Want an apple cider

07:43.243 --> 07:44.077
vinegar shot?

07:44.077 --> 07:45.478
No. Ugh.

07:45.478 --> 07:46.513
I can smell it from here.

07:46.513 --> 07:47.514
Yeah, some things

07:47.514 --> 07:48.649
aren't worth the health

07:48.649 --> 07:49.683
benefits, huh?

07:49.683 --> 07:51.384
So I think I'm gonna need to

07:51.384 --> 07:52.686
make a Whole Foods run today

07:52.686 --> 07:53.687
to pack...

07:53.687 --> 07:54.755
I'll probably be

07:54.755 --> 07:56.523
packing some big suitcases, too,

07:56.523 --> 07:57.758
for WrestleMania.

07:57.758 --> 07:58.759
For what?

07:58.759 --> 07:59.860
Because Birdiebee might

07:59.860 --> 08:01.902
be in the WWE Superstore.

08:01.902 --> 08:03.169
When did that happen?

08:03.169 --> 08:04.170
Nicole actually came

08:04.170 --> 08:06.239
up with the idea and, um, we

08:06.239 --> 08:08.174
asked WWE and they were all

08:08.174 --> 08:09.610
like, if there's enough space,

08:09.610 --> 08:11.411
we'd love to have that.

08:11.411 --> 08:12.579
When would you need

08:12.579 --> 08:13.614
to go out?

08:13.614 --> 08:14.615
Well, I told them,

08:14.615 --> 08:15.649
because of Birdie, just the

08:15.649 --> 08:17.651
weekend, but I also told Nicole

08:17.651 --> 08:20.286
that, you know, I feel like I

08:20.286 --> 08:21.888
could run Birdiebee.

08:21.888 --> 08:24.124
And, like, I could be the

08:24.124 --> 08:25.959
president of the company.

08:25.959 --> 08:27.694
Owning your own brand is hard

08:27.694 --> 08:29.229
work and, unfortunately, we had

08:29.229 --> 08:30.764
to part ways with our current

08:30.764 --> 08:32.498
president, which has really left

08:32.498 --> 08:34.167
a huge hole at Birdiebee.

08:34.167 --> 08:35.268
So I decided to put on my big

08:35.268 --> 08:37.070
girl pants and step up and be

08:37.070 --> 08:38.572
the president.

08:38.572 --> 08:39.405
I support you in

08:39.405 --> 08:40.573
trying, the same way that you

08:40.573 --> 08:41.707
supported me in going back to

08:41.707 --> 08:42.543
wrestling.

08:42.543 --> 08:45.111
Win, place. Place.

08:45.111 --> 08:47.814
Winston, place.

08:47.814 --> 08:48.882
Good boy.

08:48.882 --> 08:50.483
Screw you, Win.

08:50.483 --> 08:52.118
I'm the freaking boss now.

08:52.118 --> 08:53.019
You listen to me.

08:53.019 --> 08:53.854
Mm, she's the

08:53.854 --> 08:55.155
president.

09:00.200 --> 09:01.267
Where's Nia?

09:01.267 --> 09:02.335
She's got a lot going

09:02.335 --> 09:03.570
on, like, schedule‐wise.

09:03.570 --> 09:04.437
Okay.

09:04.437 --> 09:05.338
All right, ladies, are

09:05.338 --> 09:06.540
you ready to go on a swamp tour?

09:06.540 --> 09:07.340
Hell yeah.

09:07.340 --> 09:08.274
Let's do this.

09:08.274 --> 09:09.109
If anyone tries to tip the boat,

09:09.109 --> 09:10.143
I kill them.

09:10.143 --> 09:11.277
Ladies, ladies, I am

09:11.277 --> 09:13.880
your tour guide.

09:13.880 --> 09:16.316
Welcome to Paige Encounters.

09:16.316 --> 09:17.483
So, as you can see, there's a

09:17.483 --> 09:18.585
lot of swampy areas.

09:18.585 --> 09:19.920
Smells a little weird.

09:19.920 --> 09:21.522
There's a gator!

09:21.522 --> 09:22.656
There's one coming over

09:22.656 --> 09:23.524
there and there's one coming

09:23.524 --> 09:24.257
over there and there's one

09:24.257 --> 09:25.091
coming over there.

09:25.091 --> 09:25.792
Oh, my God! There's three

09:25.792 --> 09:28.061
coming!

09:28.061 --> 09:29.062
Are you kidding me?

09:29.796 --> 09:30.797
All right, listen up, ladies.

09:30.797 --> 09:31.765
I'm about to show you what a

09:31.765 --> 09:33.033
real crocodile hunter does right

09:33.033 --> 09:34.167
now.

09:34.167 --> 09:35.435
Ooh, give the stick

09:35.435 --> 09:36.870
back, greedy bitch.

09:37.571 --> 09:38.572
I'm flying, Jack!

09:38.572 --> 09:39.606
I'm flying!

09:39.606 --> 09:40.874
There's a pig!

09:40.874 --> 09:41.875
What?!

09:41.875 --> 09:42.943
Whoa!

09:42.943 --> 09:43.744
Little piggy.

09:43.744 --> 09:44.711
Stop the boat.

09:44.711 --> 09:46.346
Whoa! Oh, my God!

09:46.346 --> 09:47.180
There's huge pigs over there!

09:47.180 --> 09:47.881
Whoa!

09:47.881 --> 09:49.015
Oh, God, oh, God, oh, God, oh,

09:49.015 --> 09:49.916
God, oh, God.

09:52.519 --> 09:53.720
Oh, my God. My God.

09:53.720 --> 09:54.855
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

09:54.855 --> 09:55.589
Are these things gonna

09:55.589 --> 09:56.523
bite me?

09:56.523 --> 09:58.458
Bye, Big Bertha!

09:58.458 --> 09:59.726
Oh, this is, like, the

09:59.726 --> 10:00.967
road you don't take.

10:00.967 --> 10:01.702
This is certain death.

10:01.702 --> 10:02.536
Wrong turn.

10:02.536 --> 10:03.269
Do you guys believe in

10:03.269 --> 10:03.937
ghosts?

10:03.937 --> 10:04.605
Of course.

10:04.605 --> 10:05.305
And New Orleans is,

10:05.305 --> 10:06.139
like, the home of a lot of

10:06.139 --> 10:06.640
ghosts.

10:06.640 --> 10:07.407
Don't start that.

10:07.407 --> 10:08.174
It's, like, a real

10:08.174 --> 10:08.842
thing.

10:08.842 --> 10:09.576
It's, like, a real,

10:09.576 --> 10:10.243
real thing.

10:10.243 --> 10:11.044
Witches and stuff like

10:11.044 --> 10:11.712
that.

10:11.712 --> 10:12.445
The place, in general,

10:12.445 --> 10:13.479
is very spiritual, whether it be

10:13.479 --> 10:15.315
ghosts or, you know, voodoo

10:15.315 --> 10:16.883
stuff.

10:16.883 --> 10:18.118
I went to go see, like, the best

10:18.118 --> 10:19.586
voodoo lady in town.

10:19.586 --> 10:20.587
She was creepy, but I liked her

10:20.587 --> 10:21.254
a lot.

10:21.254 --> 10:22.188
But she's actually making me a

10:22.188 --> 10:23.890
voodoo doll, but it's, like, a

10:23.890 --> 10:24.825
healing voodoo doll, right?

10:24.825 --> 10:25.491
Really?

10:25.491 --> 10:26.292
And then she's like,

10:26.292 --> 10:27.327
"Oh, like, maybe in a couple

10:27.327 --> 10:28.161
months' time, you go and get the

10:28.161 --> 10:29.262
MRI again and see how it turns

10:29.262 --> 10:30.463
out."

10:30.463 --> 10:31.798
With my neck, I've tried

10:31.798 --> 10:33.767
everything to try and heal it.

10:33.767 --> 10:35.502
And so we're in New Orleans, and

10:35.502 --> 10:36.770
there's psychics, there's voodoo

10:36.770 --> 10:38.138
doll ladies.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.139
And, honestly, like, I'm a

10:39.139 --> 10:40.240
spiritual person, but, like,

10:40.240 --> 10:41.642
there's no harm in trying.

10:41.642 --> 10:42.442
I'm kind of expert in

10:42.442 --> 10:43.777
the voodoo doll area.

10:43.777 --> 10:44.778
That's why we came to

10:44.778 --> 10:45.445
you.

10:46.513 --> 10:47.581
I might need a little

10:47.581 --> 10:49.015
bit more time, because, you

10:49.015 --> 10:50.016
know, this is personalized to

10:50.016 --> 10:50.684
you.

10:50.684 --> 10:51.685
It's not, you know, hanging on

10:51.685 --> 10:52.352
the rack.

10:52.352 --> 10:53.754
Great. Let's do it.

10:53.754 --> 10:54.921
Mm‐mm.

10:54.921 --> 10:55.922
I don't even want to talk about

10:55.922 --> 10:56.590
it.

10:56.590 --> 10:57.257
What?

10:57.257 --> 10:58.024
Scares me.

10:58.024 --> 10:58.792
Creeps me out.

10:58.792 --> 10:59.693
I don't want no spirits, no

10:59.693 --> 11:01.835
demons, no ghosts, nothing

11:01.835 --> 11:03.469
coming up in my life stealing my

11:03.469 --> 11:04.304
glow.

11:04.304 --> 11:05.471
If it ain't God or Jesus, I

11:05.471 --> 11:06.272
don't want nothing to do with

11:06.272 --> 11:07.007
it.

11:07.007 --> 11:08.041
I prayed to Lord Jesus

11:08.041 --> 11:08.842
Christ.

11:08.842 --> 11:09.676
But, again, I haven't...

11:09.676 --> 11:10.410
That might work for

11:10.410 --> 11:11.277
you.

11:11.277 --> 11:12.278
I'm just saying, I don't want it

11:12.278 --> 11:13.313
to work for me.

11:13.313 --> 11:14.214
I've done everything

11:14.214 --> 11:15.849
in my power to do something.

11:15.849 --> 11:16.717
I mean, like, this is kind of,

11:16.717 --> 11:17.383
like, the last resort.

11:17.383 --> 11:18.384
My heart goes out to

11:18.384 --> 11:19.853
Paige not being able to wrestle

11:19.853 --> 11:21.287
anymore due to her injury.

11:21.287 --> 11:22.623
But I feel like Paige just has

11:22.623 --> 11:24.490
to stay positive and keep

11:24.490 --> 11:25.659
believing in herself, not the

11:25.659 --> 11:27.193
voodoo and the stuff she's

11:27.193 --> 11:30.096
looking into.

11:30.096 --> 11:31.598
Every Birdiebee shirt

11:31.598 --> 11:32.666
is going to be sold out.

11:32.666 --> 11:33.834
I want to do whatever I can to

11:33.834 --> 11:35.035
really get the word out there

11:35.035 --> 11:36.436
that Birdiebee is at the

11:36.436 --> 11:37.370
Superstore.

11:37.370 --> 11:38.805
You know the WWE Superstore?

11:38.805 --> 11:39.740
Brie and Bryan are gonna be

11:39.740 --> 11:40.974
there.

11:40.974 --> 11:41.975
We're here in New

11:41.975 --> 11:43.343
Orleans, but today we have a

11:43.343 --> 11:44.144
signing.

11:44.144 --> 11:44.811
Hey, you guys.

11:44.811 --> 11:45.612
Now we've got this

11:45.612 --> 11:46.279
flyer.

11:46.279 --> 11:47.013
Where's brunch at tomorrow?

11:47.013 --> 11:48.014
Nattie gave us this

11:48.014 --> 11:48.982
flyer and said that we could

11:48.982 --> 11:50.817
hang out.

11:50.817 --> 11:51.985
Trust me, I'm trying

11:51.985 --> 11:53.486
everything in my power to get

11:53.486 --> 11:54.420
better again.

11:54.420 --> 11:55.656
All I want to do is wrestle.

11:55.656 --> 11:56.957
WWE was supposed to be my

11:56.957 --> 12:04.470
future, and it was cut short.

12:07.974 --> 12:09.009
Oh, my God, this is

12:09.009 --> 12:10.443
amazing.

12:10.443 --> 12:12.045
Aw, there's Paige!

12:12.045 --> 12:13.313
We might find a

12:13.313 --> 12:15.015
stand‐up doll of you or I.

12:15.015 --> 12:17.217
Wow, this is so cool.

12:17.217 --> 12:18.184
Here's the twins'

12:18.184 --> 12:19.119
section.

12:19.119 --> 12:21.321
Ooh!

12:21.321 --> 12:22.288
Hi.

12:22.288 --> 12:23.256
How you doing, ladies?

12:23.256 --> 12:23.924
Good, thanks.

12:23.924 --> 12:24.925
Our store is closed.

12:24.925 --> 12:25.726
Are y'all supposed to be up in

12:25.726 --> 12:26.392
here?

12:26.392 --> 12:27.127
Yes.

12:27.127 --> 12:27.794
You sure?

12:27.794 --> 12:28.595
Oh, my face is up

12:28.595 --> 12:29.362
there.

12:29.362 --> 12:30.096
What?

12:30.096 --> 12:31.097
On that poster.

12:31.097 --> 12:32.098
Do you want to get a selfie?

12:32.098 --> 12:32.766
Yes.

12:32.766 --> 12:33.466
Here, Lana, take a

12:33.466 --> 12:34.267
picture of us.

12:34.267 --> 12:35.636
Brie and Nicole are not gonna be

12:35.636 --> 12:37.270
in WrestleMania this year.

12:37.270 --> 12:38.171
And for the first time in their

12:38.171 --> 12:40.140
WWE careers, they're gonna be

12:40.140 --> 12:41.141
spectators.

12:41.141 --> 12:42.308
But it's awesome, because

12:42.308 --> 12:43.176
they're doing something really

12:43.176 --> 12:44.110
cool.

12:44.110 --> 12:45.145
They're showcasing their line at

12:45.145 --> 12:46.479
the WWE Superstore.

12:47.147 --> 12:48.982
Oh, it's Brie.

12:48.982 --> 12:50.383
Hey, Brie.

12:50.383 --> 12:51.552
Nattie!

12:51.552 --> 12:52.953
Hey! I'm wear...

12:52.953 --> 12:53.954
Oh, my gosh, look at

12:53.954 --> 12:54.788
you two.

12:54.788 --> 12:55.488
I'm wearing my

12:55.488 --> 12:56.523
Birdiebee.

12:56.523 --> 12:57.558
I‐I'm wearing my "Bee

12:57.558 --> 12:58.224
Fearless"!

12:58.224 --> 12:58.892
And show her your

12:58.892 --> 12:59.560
shirt.

12:59.560 --> 13:00.300
Aw, you guys look so

13:00.300 --> 13:00.967
good!

13:00.967 --> 13:01.635
Well, this is

13:01.635 --> 13:02.368
awesome.

13:02.368 --> 13:03.369
The Superstore is awesome.

13:03.369 --> 13:04.738
And you guys better have enough

13:04.738 --> 13:06.039
stock, because these shirts are

13:06.039 --> 13:07.007
all gonna be gone.

13:07.007 --> 13:07.674
Yeah.

13:07.674 --> 13:08.975
Really? I hope so.

13:08.975 --> 13:09.710
I'm praying.

13:09.710 --> 13:10.443
Oh, it's definitely

13:10.443 --> 13:11.111
going to.

13:11.111 --> 13:11.845
Maybe you could throw a

13:11.845 --> 13:12.546
couple posts on your Instagram

13:12.546 --> 13:13.213
for me.

13:13.213 --> 13:14.715
Oh, yeah. Absolutely.

13:14.715 --> 13:16.216
And I promise you that every

13:16.216 --> 13:17.618
single Birdiebee shirt is going

13:17.618 --> 13:18.919
to be sold out.

13:18.919 --> 13:19.686
I promise.

13:19.686 --> 13:20.687
Aw, you've always been

13:20.687 --> 13:21.855
so supportive.

13:21.855 --> 13:23.456
I think it's, like‐‐

13:23.456 --> 13:25.158
I want this to be a great year

13:25.158 --> 13:26.827
for you guys for WrestleMania.

13:26.827 --> 13:27.861
And I was saying to Lana, like,

13:27.861 --> 13:29.162
"Last year, Nicole had this big

13:29.162 --> 13:30.163
year.

13:30.163 --> 13:30.964
The year before, you had this

13:30.964 --> 13:31.765
big year."

13:31.765 --> 13:33.199
And, like, I want this year to

13:33.199 --> 13:34.200
be, like, special for you guys.

13:34.200 --> 13:34.868
Yeah.

13:34.868 --> 13:35.669
Aw, you're so sweet,

13:35.669 --> 13:36.336
Nattie.

13:36.336 --> 13:37.671
That means a lot. Thank you.

13:37.671 --> 13:38.772
I've known the twins

13:38.772 --> 13:39.906
for over a decade.

13:39.906 --> 13:41.575
And I know that Brie and Nicole

13:41.575 --> 13:43.209
have had this vision for years.

13:43.209 --> 13:45.011
So I want to do whatever I can

13:45.011 --> 13:46.713
to really get the word out there

13:46.713 --> 13:47.781
that Birdiebee is at the

13:47.781 --> 13:49.115
WrestleMania Superstore.

13:49.115 --> 13:50.751
If I was in Brie's situation, I

13:50.751 --> 13:51.885
know that she would do the exact

13:51.885 --> 13:52.953
same thing.

13:52.953 --> 13:53.687
Tell me when you're

13:53.687 --> 13:54.354
ready.

13:54.354 --> 13:55.088
Ooh, I like that.

13:55.088 --> 13:55.822
"Bee Fearless."

13:55.822 --> 13:56.489
That's really good.

13:56.489 --> 13:57.157
That's good marketing.

13:57.157 --> 13:59.225
Okay, one, two, three, go.

13:59.225 --> 14:00.200
If you come to the

14:00.200 --> 14:02.836
WWE Superstore, to come and‐‐

14:02.836 --> 14:04.170
Hold on. Start over.

14:04.170 --> 14:06.507
And if you buy Birdiebee at the

14:06.507 --> 14:08.474
WWE Superstore, you're gonna get

14:08.474 --> 14:11.277
a chance to meet Nikki Bella and

14:11.277 --> 14:13.413
Brie Bella in person, here.

14:13.413 --> 14:14.748
Perfect.

14:14.748 --> 14:15.448
Hold on, let me do

14:15.448 --> 14:16.416
one more.

14:18.552 --> 14:20.721
You look so ridiculous, Nat.

14:20.721 --> 14:21.588
I can't breathe.

14:21.588 --> 14:22.689
I literally can't breathe.

14:22.689 --> 14:23.624
Get close, so I can‐‐

14:23.624 --> 14:24.891
you actually can‐‐

14:24.891 --> 14:27.293
And not only are you gonna meet

14:27.293 --> 14:28.929
Nikki Bella... but

14:28.929 --> 14:30.564
you're also gonna meet Brie

14:30.564 --> 14:32.198
Bella and Daniel Bryan.

14:32.198 --> 14:33.033
You're out of your

14:33.033 --> 14:33.834
mind.

14:33.834 --> 14:35.068
You're out of your mind.

14:35.068 --> 14:35.869
Now you're promoting Daniel

14:35.869 --> 14:37.270
Bryan?

14:37.270 --> 14:38.338
You want people to

14:38.338 --> 14:39.039
come and buy this stuff?

14:39.039 --> 14:39.840
First of all, you look

14:39.840 --> 14:40.707
like J. Lo from the block right

14:40.707 --> 14:42.242
now, with a small little shirt,

14:42.242 --> 14:43.176
but...

14:43.176 --> 14:44.377
Lana, I'm a big girl.

14:45.912 --> 14:46.913
Let me see that.

14:46.913 --> 14:47.614
I think this is the

14:47.614 --> 14:48.549
winner.

14:48.549 --> 14:49.950
Ew.

14:49.950 --> 14:51.351
Hold on. Start over.

14:51.351 --> 14:53.286
Start that over.

15:10.977 --> 15:11.978
Hi, guys.

15:11.978 --> 15:13.113
What's up, guys?

15:15.048 --> 15:16.182
Come to mama!

15:20.286 --> 15:21.988
Nattie! Nattie!

15:21.988 --> 15:23.189
This guy's going all out.

15:23.189 --> 15:24.190
Oh, my gosh!

15:24.190 --> 15:25.592
This is amazing!

15:25.592 --> 15:26.793
This is one of my biggest fans.

15:26.793 --> 15:27.594
Good luck in the battle

15:27.594 --> 15:28.428
royal on Sunday.

15:28.428 --> 15:29.262
Thank you so much.

15:29.262 --> 15:30.396
TJ, what do you think?

15:30.396 --> 15:31.164
She's gonna win?

15:31.164 --> 15:32.198
Battle royal?

15:32.198 --> 15:33.199
Yeah.

15:33.199 --> 15:34.535
I think she's gonna win.

15:34.535 --> 15:35.536
She has a chance, but you

15:35.536 --> 15:36.803
got Sasha in there, you got

15:36.803 --> 15:39.573
Bayley, you got Mandy.

15:39.573 --> 15:40.440
This year at

15:40.440 --> 15:41.341
WrestleMania, I'm gonna be in

15:41.341 --> 15:42.475
the first‐ever women's battle

15:42.475 --> 15:43.544
royal.

15:43.544 --> 15:44.845
And today TJ and I are at a

15:44.845 --> 15:46.112
signing together.

15:46.112 --> 15:47.681
But for some reason, I never

15:47.681 --> 15:49.783
felt so unimportant by my own

15:49.783 --> 15:51.251
husband.

15:51.251 --> 15:52.185
So, are you gonna come

15:52.185 --> 15:52.919
out and go...

15:52.919 --> 15:54.054
♪ Nattie is the best

15:54.054 --> 15:55.556
Nattie number one. ♪

15:55.556 --> 15:56.222
I'll leave that

15:56.222 --> 15:57.490
cheerleader stuff for Rusev.

♪ Lana is the best

15:58.759 --> 16:00.300

16:00.300 --> 16:02.102
♪ Lana is the best

16:02.102 --> 16:03.937
Lana's number one. ♪

16:03.937 --> 16:05.071
I know you think it's

16:05.071 --> 16:06.940
funny, but it's sometimes...

16:06.940 --> 16:08.374
Oh, hell yeah.

16:08.374 --> 16:09.375
Giving me a

16:09.375 --> 16:10.243
compliment isn't the hardest

16:10.243 --> 16:11.144
thing in the world.

16:11.144 --> 16:12.078
It just seems cheesy if I

16:12.078 --> 16:13.179
just say, "Oh, Nattie's gonna

16:13.179 --> 16:13.980
win."

16:13.980 --> 16:14.781
Be cheesy.

16:14.781 --> 16:15.782
I like cheesy.

16:15.782 --> 16:16.650
I love you, but you

16:16.650 --> 16:18.251
just made my weekend.

16:18.251 --> 16:19.285
You are one of my top five of

16:19.285 --> 16:20.453
the last decade.

16:20.453 --> 16:21.221
I miss him.

16:21.221 --> 16:21.988
Thank you.

16:21.988 --> 16:23.323
Aw. He's amazing.

16:23.323 --> 16:24.791
For me, I‐I don't have a problem

16:24.791 --> 16:26.359
throwing around compliments.

16:26.359 --> 16:28.094
Nattie gives TJ a compliment, TJ

16:28.094 --> 16:29.663
gives Nattie a compliment,

16:29.663 --> 16:31.364
especially when he also knows

16:31.364 --> 16:32.432
I'm really nervous for the

16:32.432 --> 16:33.900
battle royal.

16:33.900 --> 16:35.235
But TJ is like a spoiled Persian

16:35.235 --> 16:36.837
cat.

16:36.837 --> 16:38.204
Yeah, he thinks Sasha's gonna

16:38.204 --> 16:39.305
win the battle royal on Sunday.

16:39.305 --> 16:40.406
Honestly, good guess.

16:40.406 --> 16:41.441
He gets it.

16:41.441 --> 16:43.309
No! I‐I am the best!

16:43.309 --> 16:45.478
I am number one.

16:45.478 --> 16:46.547
I'm sorry.

16:46.547 --> 16:47.548
My voice keeps going in and out.

16:47.548 --> 16:48.348
Okay. No worry.

16:48.348 --> 16:49.149
It's probably seeing

16:49.149 --> 16:49.816
him, actually.

16:49.816 --> 16:50.483
I lose my voice.

16:50.483 --> 16:51.151
Yeah!

16:51.151 --> 16:51.952
'Cause I was excited

16:51.952 --> 16:52.886
to see my boy.

16:52.886 --> 16:53.787
All Italian fans want

16:53.787 --> 16:55.989
to see you again, in the ring as

16:55.989 --> 16:56.923
a performer.

16:56.923 --> 16:58.925
Are there any hopes for this to

16:58.925 --> 17:00.834
happen?

17:00.834 --> 17:03.003
Well, you know, never

17:03.003 --> 17:04.003
say never, which is also...

17:04.003 --> 17:05.137
I need to see more doctors, and

17:05.137 --> 17:06.138
hopefully, I get the big

17:06.138 --> 17:07.674
clearance, but never say never.

17:07.674 --> 17:09.209
Obviously, there's a lot of

17:09.209 --> 17:10.310
rumors going around about my

17:10.310 --> 17:12.078
neck, and I can't say anything

17:12.078 --> 17:13.780
about it, so I'll just be like,

17:13.780 --> 17:14.781
"Everything's fine.

17:14.781 --> 17:16.148
Next question."

17:16.148 --> 17:16.983
I love watching you

17:16.983 --> 17:17.983
in the ring.

17:17.983 --> 17:18.984
Thank you.

17:18.984 --> 17:19.819
But I have to say

17:19.819 --> 17:21.320
that I really do miss seeing

17:21.320 --> 17:22.589
you compete.

17:22.589 --> 17:23.723
How hard has it been to not be

17:23.723 --> 17:24.724
able to compete and deal with

17:24.724 --> 17:25.726
your injury?

17:25.726 --> 17:26.727
It is tough, 'cause I

17:26.727 --> 17:28.228
don't like not being able to

17:28.228 --> 17:29.229
tell them, too.

17:29.229 --> 17:30.230
It's the women's

17:30.230 --> 17:31.231
battle royal this weekend.

17:31.231 --> 17:32.232
It is.

17:32.232 --> 17:33.066
Sadly, you're not

17:33.066 --> 17:34.000
going to be in it.

17:34.000 --> 17:34.668
No.

17:34.668 --> 17:35.902
I'm getting so burned out.

17:35.902 --> 17:36.737
We're just talking about not

17:36.737 --> 17:37.738
being in a ring.

17:37.738 --> 17:38.572
I'm trying to keep myself

17:38.572 --> 17:39.573
together.

17:39.573 --> 17:40.641
Like, I don't ever want to seem

17:40.641 --> 17:42.308
weak in front of people.

17:42.308 --> 17:44.410
It just gets really frustrating.

17:44.410 --> 17:45.478
Like, honestly, I just...

17:45.478 --> 17:46.312
I'm so done with this.

17:46.312 --> 17:47.480
I just want to go back to my

17:47.480 --> 17:49.482
room; I just want to hide out.

17:49.482 --> 17:50.316
Like, I don't...

17:50.316 --> 17:51.317
I just don't want to be around

17:51.317 --> 17:52.318
anyone right now.

17:52.318 --> 17:54.320
Oh, my goodness.

17:54.320 --> 17:55.321
Hey, guys.

17:55.321 --> 17:56.623
If you guys show up on Saturday,

17:56.623 --> 17:58.424
Nikki, Brie and Bryan are gonna

17:58.424 --> 17:59.425
be there.

17:59.425 --> 18:00.601
Nattie is promising

18:00.601 --> 18:01.602
things that she doesn't even

18:01.602 --> 18:02.503
know that the Bellas are gonna

18:02.503 --> 18:03.504
do.

18:03.504 --> 18:04.404
You cannot be saying that

18:04.404 --> 18:05.405
they're gonna be there.

18:05.405 --> 18:06.406
I believe in God and

18:06.406 --> 18:07.407
Jesus.

18:07.407 --> 18:08.441
If it ain't about that, then I

18:08.441 --> 18:09.275
don't want to have nothing to do

18:09.275 --> 18:10.276
with it.

18:10.276 --> 18:11.111
Trin isn't, obviously,

18:11.111 --> 18:12.345
into the whole spiritual stuff.

18:12.345 --> 18:13.313
Aah! I'm not gonna!

18:13.313 --> 18:14.314
I don't... No. No.

18:14.314 --> 18:15.148
Mm, just one second.

18:15.148 --> 18:19.452
Just one second.

18:26.059 --> 18:27.493
Oh,.

18:27.493 --> 18:28.494
I'm too big for these cars.

18:28.494 --> 18:29.495
All right, ándele, girls.

18:29.495 --> 18:30.496
Let's go.

18:30.496 --> 18:31.497
Mama's got you.

18:31.497 --> 18:32.298
Aah! You're putting

18:32.298 --> 18:33.099
your finger directly in my

18:33.099 --> 18:34.100
ass.

18:34.100 --> 18:34.935
You good?

18:36.770 --> 18:37.604
That, like, made me tickle a

18:37.604 --> 18:38.404
little bit.

18:38.404 --> 18:39.239
Did I get you?

18:39.239 --> 18:40.073
Yeah, I'm good.

18:40.073 --> 18:40.941
Oh, my God, is she...?

18:40.941 --> 18:41.742
You know Daniel

18:41.742 --> 18:42.576
Bryan, Brie Bella, Nikki Bella?

18:42.576 --> 18:43.577
Yes.

18:43.577 --> 18:44.344
Wait. What are you

18:44.344 --> 18:45.011
saying?

18:45.011 --> 18:45.879
So come down.

18:45.879 --> 18:46.913
Check us out at WrestleMania

18:46.913 --> 18:47.748
Axxess, and if you come down,

18:47.748 --> 18:48.749
they're gonna be there.

18:48.749 --> 18:50.450
I'm so excited because we're

18:50.450 --> 18:51.351
going out with Paige tonight.

18:51.351 --> 18:52.485
What are you drinking?

18:52.485 --> 18:53.486
Margarita.

18:53.486 --> 18:54.420
Oh, I love

18:54.420 --> 18:55.421
margaritas.

18:55.421 --> 18:56.222
I do, too.

18:56.222 --> 18:57.223
And it's Bourbon

18:57.223 --> 18:57.891
Street.

18:57.891 --> 18:58.892
There's nothing but people.

18:58.892 --> 18:59.926
There's people that are excited

18:59.926 --> 19:00.701
about life, that are excited

19:00.701 --> 19:01.602
about drinking, that are excited

19:01.602 --> 19:02.769
about WrestleMania.

19:02.769 --> 19:03.837
And for me, it's a great

19:03.837 --> 19:06.172
opportunity to pass out flyers

19:06.172 --> 19:07.574
and just do stuff to kind of get

19:07.574 --> 19:08.742
the word out there that the

19:08.742 --> 19:09.743
twins have Birdiebee at the WWE

19:09.743 --> 19:10.744
Superstore.

19:10.744 --> 19:11.745
Hey, guys.

19:11.745 --> 19:13.346
If you guys show up on Saturday,

19:13.346 --> 19:15.015
you might meet my cat 2Pawz.

19:15.015 --> 19:16.817
Oh, okay.

19:16.817 --> 19:18.885
Birdiebee!

19:18.885 --> 19:19.886
Come and support Birdiebee on

19:19.886 --> 19:20.887
Saturday, and you never know

19:20.887 --> 19:21.888
who's gonna show up.

19:21.888 --> 19:22.889
Yeah.

19:22.889 --> 19:23.757
I might bring my

19:23.757 --> 19:24.825
husband Tyson Kidd.

19:24.825 --> 19:26.292
This is so awkward,

19:26.292 --> 19:27.293
Nattie.

19:27.293 --> 19:29.029
You're doing the most.

19:29.029 --> 19:30.030
Birdiebee!

19:30.030 --> 19:32.465
Birdiebee! Birdiebee!

19:32.465 --> 19:33.667
Stop that!

19:33.667 --> 19:34.500
You're cut off.

19:34.500 --> 19:35.502
This isn't the type of

19:35.502 --> 19:36.870
promotion that I feel Nikki and

19:36.870 --> 19:37.871
Brie would want.

19:37.871 --> 19:38.872
You know the WWE

19:38.872 --> 19:39.873
Superstore?

19:39.873 --> 19:41.474
Nikki, Brie and Bryan are gonna

19:41.474 --> 19:42.308
be there, and you get to meet

19:42.308 --> 19:43.143
them if you buy some of the

19:43.143 --> 19:44.144
Birdiebee.

19:44.144 --> 19:45.145
Hey!

19:45.145 --> 19:45.946
They might be there,

19:45.946 --> 19:46.747
but, yeah.

19:46.747 --> 19:47.548
Definitely come get Birdiebee.

19:47.548 --> 19:48.348
We're pretty sure

19:48.348 --> 19:49.550
they're gonna be there.

19:49.550 --> 19:50.383
Nattie is promising

19:50.383 --> 19:51.184
things that she doesn't even

19:51.184 --> 19:51.985
know that the Bellas are gonna

19:51.985 --> 19:52.986
do, so it's gonna make fans

19:52.986 --> 19:53.987
upset.

19:53.987 --> 19:54.988
I mean, she's just going about

19:54.988 --> 19:56.389
this all the wrong way.

19:56.389 --> 19:57.390
Seriously, you cannot be saying

19:57.390 --> 19:58.391
that they're gonna be there.

19:58.391 --> 19:59.459
Like, this is...

19:59.459 --> 20:00.333
The fact that we're handing out

20:00.333 --> 20:01.334
flyers is...

20:01.334 --> 20:02.335
No, no, no.

20:02.335 --> 20:03.336
But seriously?

20:03.336 --> 20:04.170
I'm getting a little

20:04.170 --> 20:05.739
excited, but, you know, whatever

20:05.739 --> 20:07.307
it takes to get the word out.

20:07.307 --> 20:09.409
And when Birdiebee sells out at

20:09.409 --> 20:10.844
the WWE Superstore, Brie and

20:10.844 --> 20:11.845
Nicole are...

20:11.845 --> 20:12.846
They're gonna be thanking me.

20:12.846 --> 20:13.847
It's too much.

20:13.847 --> 20:14.848
It's too much. Oh, boy.

20:14.848 --> 20:15.849
Hey!

20:15.849 --> 20:16.850
Hey.

20:16.850 --> 20:17.851
How are you?

20:17.851 --> 20:18.852
I'm great.

20:18.852 --> 20:19.686
How are you?

20:19.686 --> 20:20.687
Come and have a seat

20:20.687 --> 20:22.689
with me, I need to talk to you.

20:22.689 --> 20:23.690
What is this?

20:23.690 --> 20:25.325
Guys, I need privacy.

20:25.325 --> 20:26.459
What I want you to do

20:26.459 --> 20:27.861
for me‐‐ just relax yourself.

20:27.861 --> 20:29.663
Take three deep breaths and

20:29.663 --> 20:30.664
shuffle these cards for me.

20:30.664 --> 20:31.665
Shuffle 'em?

20:31.665 --> 20:32.666
Oh, no. What...?

20:34.300 --> 20:35.301
Hey, guys, take a

20:35.301 --> 20:37.203
hike, all right?

20:37.203 --> 20:38.539
The first thing that

20:38.539 --> 20:39.540
you need to realize is that

20:39.540 --> 20:41.041
you're a very powerful woman.

20:41.041 --> 20:42.042
Ooh.

20:42.042 --> 20:43.143
The responsibility

20:43.143 --> 20:44.144
with that is great.

20:44.144 --> 20:45.145
That looks so shady.

20:45.145 --> 20:46.146
Are you, like, afraid if

20:46.146 --> 20:48.148
she says something?

20:48.148 --> 20:49.149
You know what I mean? Like...

20:49.149 --> 20:49.983
It's not so much

20:49.983 --> 20:50.984
afraid, it's just, I believe in

20:50.984 --> 20:52.218
God and Jesus.

20:52.218 --> 20:53.687
If it ain't about that, then I

20:53.687 --> 20:54.888
don't want to have nothing to do

20:54.888 --> 20:55.556
with it.

20:55.556 --> 20:56.557
That's just what I believe.

20:56.557 --> 20:57.558
No. That's totally fine.

20:57.558 --> 20:58.391
You are a gift to this

20:58.391 --> 20:59.392
planet.

20:59.392 --> 21:00.233
If you just agree that you're a

21:00.233 --> 21:01.067
powerful woman, you will be

21:01.067 --> 21:02.068
unconquerable.

21:02.068 --> 21:02.836
Thank you for my

21:02.836 --> 21:03.904
reading.

21:03.904 --> 21:04.905
Thank you so much.

21:04.905 --> 21:05.672
It was very, very

21:05.672 --> 21:06.873
accurate, and I love it.

21:06.873 --> 21:08.008
I‐I have a question to ask you,

21:08.008 --> 21:08.675
though.

21:08.675 --> 21:09.543
Yes.

21:09.543 --> 21:10.711
The woman with the

21:10.711 --> 21:11.578
green hair over there‐‐ she has

21:11.578 --> 21:12.579
long hair with the green hair?

21:12.579 --> 21:13.547
I see.

21:13.547 --> 21:14.648
I want you to, like,

21:14.648 --> 21:15.481
tell her to come over, and then

21:15.481 --> 21:16.282
be like, "Wait. I can't read

21:16.282 --> 21:17.117
you."

21:17.117 --> 21:18.118
I'll give you 50 bucks to do

21:18.118 --> 21:19.119
that.

21:19.119 --> 21:20.921
Okay. We ready?

21:20.921 --> 21:22.188
Trin isn't into the

21:22.188 --> 21:23.189
whole spiritual stuff.

21:23.189 --> 21:24.725
She's more God and Jesus and all

21:24.725 --> 21:25.726
that kind of stuff.

21:25.726 --> 21:26.527
But you know me.

21:26.527 --> 21:27.528
I like to play pranks on people.

21:27.528 --> 21:28.529
Trin? Yeah.

21:28.529 --> 21:29.495
No, no, no.

21:29.495 --> 21:30.296
No, no, no, no.

21:30.296 --> 21:31.197
Hey, baby girl.

21:31.197 --> 21:32.098
Come here just for one second.

21:32.098 --> 21:32.899
At least just say hi to the

21:32.899 --> 21:33.900
lady...

21:33.900 --> 21:34.901
Hi!

21:34.901 --> 21:35.902
Over here.

21:35.902 --> 21:36.903
No. Aah!

21:36.903 --> 21:37.704
I'm not gonna. I don't...

21:37.704 --> 21:38.705
No. No.

21:38.705 --> 21:39.472
Just one second.

21:39.472 --> 21:40.473
Just one second.

21:40.473 --> 21:41.241
I will kill

21:41.241 --> 21:41.908
you.

21:41.908 --> 21:42.843
I will love you.

21:42.843 --> 21:43.877
No! I will say hello

21:43.877 --> 21:44.711
and shake her hand, but that's

21:44.711 --> 21:46.212
it.

21:46.212 --> 21:47.213
You know what?

21:47.213 --> 21:49.115
I don't want to read you.

21:49.115 --> 21:50.116
You're not ready.

21:50.116 --> 21:51.117
You're not ready.

21:51.117 --> 21:52.118
You're not ready.

21:52.118 --> 21:53.119
She's not

21:53.119 --> 21:54.120
ready.

21:54.120 --> 21:55.121
You're damn right

21:55.121 --> 21:56.857
I'm not, bitch.

22:03.670 --> 22:06.272
I need a water.

22:06.272 --> 22:08.208
I need a water and a whiskey.

22:08.208 --> 22:09.209
I just saw a picture of you

22:09.209 --> 22:10.744
sitting up on the barricade, and

22:10.744 --> 22:11.745
a kid staring at your ass.

22:11.745 --> 22:12.746
Did you see that?

22:12.746 --> 22:13.747
Oh, that was on

22:13.747 --> 22:14.615
yesterday.

22:14.615 --> 22:15.616
Was it? Oh, my God.

22:15.616 --> 22:17.450
I was dying.

22:17.450 --> 22:19.553
Nene, I'm excited

22:19.553 --> 22:20.554
to see you Sunday.

22:20.554 --> 22:21.555
I'm still nervous as

22:22.556 --> 22:24.057
I'm blessed that I'm a part of a

22:24.057 --> 22:25.526
singles match at WrestleMania.

22:25.526 --> 22:26.993
Like, for a female, that's huge.

22:26.993 --> 22:28.428
The closer and closer we get to

22:28.428 --> 22:29.996
WrestleMania, I am just...

22:29.996 --> 22:31.264
I'm so stressed.

22:31.264 --> 22:32.265
I really will be

22:32.265 --> 22:33.266
disappointed if you don't win.

22:33.266 --> 22:34.267
I'll be disappointed!

22:34.267 --> 22:35.268
I know, but...

22:35.268 --> 22:36.436
Not only am I getting to

22:36.436 --> 22:37.838
wrestle on the grandest stage of

22:37.838 --> 22:39.205
them all‐‐ WrestleMania‐‐ but

22:39.205 --> 22:41.274
I'm going against my ex‐best

22:41.274 --> 22:42.275
friend, Alexa Bliss.

22:42.275 --> 22:43.276
Chest bump.

22:43.276 --> 22:44.277
Got you.

22:44.277 --> 22:45.278
I'm coming around.

22:46.279 --> 22:47.047
I'm just saying...

22:47.047 --> 22:47.881
You know what I'm talking about?

22:47.881 --> 22:48.882
Just kidding.

22:48.882 --> 22:49.716
Watch your vagina.

22:49.716 --> 22:50.717
I'll always have her

22:50.717 --> 22:51.552
back, and she'll always have

22:51.552 --> 22:52.218
mine.

22:52.218 --> 22:52.886
Got you!

22:52.886 --> 22:54.320
Alexa and I used to be really

22:54.320 --> 22:55.856
close, but we've had a falling

22:55.856 --> 22:58.124
out, and, you know, we have a

22:58.124 --> 22:59.359
lot of animosity going into

22:59.359 --> 23:00.366
this, so, it's adding a ton of

23:00.366 --> 23:01.367
pressure to me.

23:01.367 --> 23:02.368
You, like, literally have an

23:02.368 --> 23:03.436
excuse for everything that I

23:03.436 --> 23:04.437
say.

23:04.437 --> 23:06.172
Excuse after an excuse after an

23:06.172 --> 23:07.674
excuse.

23:07.674 --> 23:08.675
She can't take the

23:08.675 --> 23:09.776
time to understand my life and

23:09.776 --> 23:11.077
what I'm going through with my

23:11.077 --> 23:12.345
love life, I don't want to take

23:12.345 --> 23:14.548
time to try to understand hers.

23:14.548 --> 23:15.549
I have new gear!

23:15.549 --> 23:16.550
Can I see?

23:16.550 --> 23:17.551
Oh, yeah. I had to get

23:17.551 --> 23:18.552
it fixed 'cause I had a camel

23:18.552 --> 23:19.553
toe.

23:19.553 --> 23:20.554
I hate when I get

23:20.554 --> 23:21.221
camel toe.

23:22.589 --> 23:24.424
Oh, my God, that's beautiful!

23:24.424 --> 23:25.626
So it's done like a body

23:25.626 --> 23:26.627
suit.

23:26.627 --> 23:27.393
It's beautiful.

23:27.393 --> 23:28.762
Show Trin.

23:28.762 --> 23:31.865
Ooh.

23:31.865 --> 23:32.866
Wait. Is this for this?

23:32.866 --> 23:34.234
This is Mania.

23:34.234 --> 23:35.969
Oh, my God, I <i>love.</i>

23:35.969 --> 23:36.803
I'm gonna be livid if

23:36.803 --> 23:37.638
you don't win that title on

23:37.638 --> 23:38.639
Sunday.

23:38.639 --> 23:39.640
I feel like I'd be

23:39.640 --> 23:42.509
very selfish thinking like,

23:42.509 --> 23:43.610
"Hey, you guys can't talk about

23:43.610 --> 23:44.545
your stuff, because you have to

23:44.545 --> 23:45.546
worry about me."

23:45.546 --> 23:46.547
Like, they're excited.

23:46.547 --> 23:47.681
It's WrestleMania, and I'm happy

23:47.681 --> 23:48.915
for them, but, like, I really

23:48.915 --> 23:50.283
want to be a part of this, and

23:50.283 --> 23:51.284
it makes me feel, like, really

23:51.284 --> 23:52.485
sad, and I'm just kind of

23:52.485 --> 23:53.486
sitting there, being, like,

23:53.486 --> 23:54.588
"Well, I have nothing to talk

23:54.588 --> 23:55.789
about with you guys right now,

23:55.789 --> 23:57.891
so, I'm just gonna be quiet."

24:00.000 --> 24:01.001
Some little things we

24:01.001 --> 24:03.069
have to do to get her started.

24:03.069 --> 24:03.904
When you have

24:03.904 --> 24:04.971
something as serious as a

24:04.971 --> 24:06.339
career‐ending injury, you want

24:06.339 --> 24:07.708
to try anything.

24:09.743 --> 24:10.677
Most people‐‐ they

24:10.677 --> 24:11.678
never have a singles match...

24:11.678 --> 24:12.679
In their career.

24:12.679 --> 24:13.680
In their career.

24:13.680 --> 24:15.048
Not only will all your

24:15.048 --> 24:16.216
competitors eat you up.

24:16.216 --> 24:17.217
Also, all the fans are gonna eat

24:17.217 --> 24:17.884
you up.

24:17.884 --> 24:18.919
I would be... I would legit be

24:18.919 --> 24:19.753
freaking out, like, for real.

24:19.753 --> 24:26.459
Yeah.

24:36.236 --> 24:37.237
We have arrived in

24:37.237 --> 24:38.238
NOLO.

24:38.238 --> 24:39.239
Wait. No. I totally said that

24:39.239 --> 24:40.240
wrong.

24:40.240 --> 24:41.241
NOLA.

24:41.241 --> 24:42.375
Uh, but we're here, New Orleans,

24:42.375 --> 24:44.711
WrestleMania week, but today, we

24:44.711 --> 24:46.547
have a signing, and I just

24:46.547 --> 24:48.081
always get excited for these,

24:48.081 --> 24:49.550
because my Bella Army means the

24:49.550 --> 24:50.717
world to me.

24:50.717 --> 24:52.118
Hi. How are you? What's up?

24:54.387 --> 24:55.388
Hey, guys.

24:55.388 --> 24:58.091
Hey. Hi.

24:58.091 --> 24:59.092
Love you.

25:02.669 --> 25:05.105
Yes! Yes!

25:07.841 --> 25:10.276
Daniel Bryan!

25:10.276 --> 25:12.278
Daniel Bryan!

25:12.278 --> 25:13.279
You guys ready?

25:13.279 --> 25:13.947
Yes.

25:13.947 --> 25:15.281
Yeah, let's do it.

25:15.281 --> 25:16.282
How are you, cutie?

25:16.282 --> 25:17.283
Oh, it's so nice to meet you.

25:17.283 --> 25:18.284
You are so my

25:18.284 --> 25:19.285
inspiration.

25:19.285 --> 25:20.286
Oh!

25:20.286 --> 25:21.287
Oh, my gosh.

25:21.287 --> 25:22.288
Thank you so much.

25:22.288 --> 25:23.089
That means so much.

25:23.089 --> 25:24.090
Okay.

25:24.090 --> 25:24.925
Oh, my gosh.

25:24.925 --> 25:25.759
Oh, you're so...

25:25.759 --> 25:26.560
Oh, my gosh, did you

25:26.560 --> 25:29.663
get...? Yes.

25:29.663 --> 25:32.966
You having fun?

25:32.966 --> 25:34.535
Your outfit's so cute.

25:34.535 --> 25:36.369
I feel like I need this. Oh...

25:36.369 --> 25:37.804
As a dad, you don't know

25:37.804 --> 25:39.205
what it's like for her to be

25:39.205 --> 25:40.373
able to look up to women like

25:40.373 --> 25:41.508
you that are ridiculously strong

25:41.508 --> 25:42.509
and...

25:42.509 --> 25:43.043
Thank you.

25:43.043 --> 25:44.044
Keep on doing what

25:44.044 --> 25:44.545
you're doing.

25:44.545 --> 25:45.846
You guys are the classiest.

25:45.846 --> 25:47.548
What up? How are you?

25:47.548 --> 25:48.549
Fine,

25:48.549 --> 25:49.049
and you?

25:49.049 --> 25:50.050
Good, thanks.

25:50.050 --> 25:51.351
Hello. Bonjour.

25:51.351 --> 25:52.519
Je m'appelle Brie.

25:52.519 --> 25:53.520
Et toi?

25:54.521 --> 25:55.656
Oh, yeah, no idea.

25:56.823 --> 25:57.824
Hello.

25:57.824 --> 25:59.793
Hi. How are you? Oh.

25:59.793 --> 26:01.267
Nattie gave us this

26:01.267 --> 26:02.636
flyer on Bourbon Street, and

26:02.636 --> 26:03.837
said that we could hang out.

26:03.837 --> 26:05.171
Oh. Nattie did?

26:05.171 --> 26:06.372
Yeah.

26:06.372 --> 26:07.874
Nattie gave us this on

26:07.874 --> 26:10.076
Bourbon, and lunch is tomorrow.

26:10.076 --> 26:11.244
Oh, really?

26:11.244 --> 26:13.046
Wait, what? Like, I'm really

26:13.046 --> 26:14.615
confused right now.

26:14.615 --> 26:15.616
Was it Bourbon Street and she

26:15.616 --> 26:16.282
was drunk?

26:16.282 --> 26:17.383
She had a big... one

26:17.383 --> 26:18.752
of those big drinks with her.

26:18.752 --> 26:20.053
I bet she did.

26:20.053 --> 26:22.155
I love Nattie, but I can't help

26:22.155 --> 26:23.423
but think, like, did Nattie and

26:23.423 --> 26:24.558
Brie tell people that we would

26:24.558 --> 26:26.326
hang out with fans, that we

26:26.326 --> 26:28.962
would do certain activities?

26:28.962 --> 26:31.031
I'm just like, "Wait, what is

26:31.031 --> 26:32.198
happening?"

26:32.198 --> 26:34.200
I'm sorry, guys! I love you!

26:35.836 --> 26:37.270
What was up with all this stuff

26:37.270 --> 26:38.371
with, um, everyone asking

26:38.371 --> 26:39.372
about...

26:39.372 --> 26:40.607
Nattie said she wanted

26:40.607 --> 26:42.042
to help out, which I was like,

26:42.042 --> 26:43.476
"That's awesome, whatever."

26:43.476 --> 26:44.044
Yeah?

26:44.044 --> 26:47.013
And... I just thought,

26:47.013 --> 26:48.114
like, her and Lana went to the

26:48.114 --> 26:49.149
store, and they were doing cute

26:49.149 --> 26:50.216
videos, they tagged us, and I'm

26:50.216 --> 26:51.217
like, "Oh, that's awesome."

26:51.217 --> 26:51.885
I didn't know...

26:51.885 --> 26:52.886
Do you have the

26:52.886 --> 26:53.386
videos?

26:53.386 --> 26:54.387
I have it.

26:54.387 --> 26:55.388
If you buy

26:55.388 --> 26:56.757
Birdiebee in the WWE Superstore,

26:56.757 --> 26:58.424
you're gonna get a chance to

26:58.424 --> 27:00.967
meet Nikki Bella and Brie Bella

27:00.967 --> 27:01.968
in person here at the

27:01.968 --> 27:02.503
Superstore.

27:02.503 --> 27:03.837
Oh, I didn't see this.

27:03.837 --> 27:04.905
We need to talk to

27:04.905 --> 27:05.906
her.

27:05.906 --> 27:06.907
Nattie knows that

27:06.907 --> 27:08.408
WrestleMania weekend's chaotic,

27:08.408 --> 27:10.343
and to promise stuff like that

27:10.343 --> 27:11.678
is ridiculous.

27:11.678 --> 27:13.246
And the worst part about all of

27:13.246 --> 27:16.016
this is that this is all my

27:16.016 --> 27:17.784
doing, in my sister's eyes.

27:17.784 --> 27:18.785
And you know what,

27:18.785 --> 27:19.452
President?

27:19.452 --> 27:20.554
We really need to talk to

27:20.554 --> 27:21.555
Nattie, but I need to use the

27:21.555 --> 27:22.789
bathroom so bad.

27:22.789 --> 27:23.757
Why didn't you guys tell me

27:23.757 --> 27:25.258
this outfit made me look fat?

27:25.258 --> 27:26.259
It doesn't make you

27:26.259 --> 27:27.260
look fat.

27:27.260 --> 27:28.261
It's just because you have

27:28.261 --> 27:29.262
clothes on, and you're not used

27:29.262 --> 27:29.763
to that.

27:29.763 --> 27:31.131
Exactly.

27:38.304 --> 27:39.305
And it's such an

27:39.305 --> 27:41.842
honor to be, um, representing

27:41.842 --> 27:43.276
the Boys & Girls Clubs of

27:43.276 --> 27:45.278
America.

27:49.950 --> 27:51.084
Wait, are these all the

27:51.084 --> 27:52.085
stuff from Mardi Gras?

27:52.085 --> 27:53.086
This is Mardi Gras.

27:53.086 --> 27:54.087
Oh, my gosh.

27:54.087 --> 27:55.088
I kind of want to,

27:55.088 --> 27:56.089
like, walk though a little bit.

27:56.089 --> 27:57.090
Let's walk.

27:57.090 --> 27:58.091
Let's walk through.

27:58.091 --> 27:59.092
Hi, Cleopatra.

27:59.092 --> 28:00.333
King Tut, what's up?

28:00.333 --> 28:01.635
This is so neat.

28:01.635 --> 28:03.103
We are here at Superstars for

28:03.103 --> 28:06.206
Hope, and the event is amazing.

28:06.206 --> 28:08.074
It's so New Orleans.

28:08.074 --> 28:10.276
But Nattie will be here, which

28:10.276 --> 28:11.878
I'm very happy about, because I

28:11.878 --> 28:12.879
need to have a little

28:12.879 --> 28:13.880
conversation with her.

28:13.880 --> 28:14.881
I hate having these

28:14.881 --> 28:15.882
conversations.

28:15.882 --> 28:17.551
I do, but I'm president, so I

28:17.551 --> 28:19.219
need to start learning.

28:19.219 --> 28:20.253
When I was breastfeeding, this

28:20.253 --> 28:21.387
is what I felt like.

28:21.387 --> 28:22.055
Yeah?

28:22.055 --> 28:22.723
All day long.

28:22.723 --> 28:23.223
Nattie!

28:23.223 --> 28:24.224
Both of you look so

28:24.224 --> 28:24.725
cute.

28:24.725 --> 28:25.726
Oh, my gosh, look at

28:25.726 --> 28:26.727
you.

28:26.727 --> 28:27.728
You guys.

28:27.728 --> 28:29.329
Is this not crazy?

28:29.329 --> 28:30.330
So, Nattie, you know

28:30.330 --> 28:31.331
you're in trouble with Brie and

28:31.331 --> 28:31.832
I.

28:31.832 --> 28:32.833
Why?

28:32.833 --> 28:33.834
You know, it's always

28:33.834 --> 28:34.835
hard to get mad at you, I'm not

28:34.835 --> 28:35.836
gonna lie.

28:35.836 --> 28:37.604
So, we had an Axxess signing

28:37.604 --> 28:39.305
today, and I found out that you

28:39.305 --> 28:40.841
made some promises to some fans

28:40.841 --> 28:44.277
that... aren't happening.

28:44.277 --> 28:45.445
I told Brie on the

28:45.445 --> 28:46.613
phone, I was like, "I'm gonna do

28:46.613 --> 28:47.681
everything in my power to make

28:47.681 --> 28:49.015
sure that we sell every single

28:49.015 --> 28:50.751
shirt in this store," because

28:50.751 --> 28:53.119
that way we spread the message.

28:53.119 --> 28:54.354
Yeah, and I love that,

28:54.354 --> 28:55.822
but do you also see how

28:55.822 --> 28:58.158
promising people certain things

28:58.158 --> 29:00.066
could either make the brand look

29:00.066 --> 29:01.067
desperate, or it could hurt the

29:01.067 --> 29:02.068
brand if it doesn't get

29:02.068 --> 29:03.069
delivered.

29:03.069 --> 29:04.070
No, you're right.

29:04.070 --> 29:05.138
And I feel bad; I should

29:05.138 --> 29:07.340
probably not have promised...

29:07.340 --> 29:08.341
I'm sorry, I feel bad.

29:08.341 --> 29:09.342
No, it's okay.

29:09.342 --> 29:10.343
I understood where you were

29:10.343 --> 29:11.612
coming from.

29:11.612 --> 29:13.046
Well, here's to Birdiebee.

29:13.046 --> 29:14.047
Yes. And us three being

29:14.047 --> 29:15.048
back together again here at

29:15.048 --> 29:15.549
WrestleMania.

29:15.549 --> 29:16.550
I know.

29:16.550 --> 29:17.551
Now, let's go look at

29:17.551 --> 29:18.985
these crazy floats.

29:18.985 --> 29:20.220
No Bourbon Street for

29:20.220 --> 29:21.221
Nattie tonight.

29:21.221 --> 29:22.388
Nattie, we're staying here.

29:41.241 --> 29:42.242
Aah.

29:42.743 --> 29:43.744
Good luck.

29:43.744 --> 29:44.945
Thank you so much.

29:44.945 --> 29:48.148
Nia. Baby girl!

29:48.148 --> 29:49.750
I missed you today.

29:49.750 --> 29:51.117
Let's go!

29:51.117 --> 29:52.485
We have to go do the cemetery

29:52.485 --> 29:53.486
shoot.

29:53.486 --> 29:54.487
Uh, was that today?

29:54.487 --> 29:55.488
Yeah, it's, like,

29:55.488 --> 29:55.989
right now.

29:55.989 --> 29:56.990
I've been waiting for you, baby

29:56.990 --> 29:57.490
girl.

29:57.490 --> 29:59.059
Uh... I totally forgot.

29:59.059 --> 30:01.835
I have Axxess. I have to go.

30:01.835 --> 30:02.836
So, okay, like, what

30:02.836 --> 30:03.837
were you doing, like... what

30:03.837 --> 30:05.205
were you doing right now?

30:05.205 --> 30:06.640
You keep promising me all this

30:06.640 --> 30:08.008
stuff, and then you didn't sign

30:08.008 --> 30:09.075
up for the swamp tour.

30:09.075 --> 30:10.110
My schedule obviously isn't as

30:10.110 --> 30:11.645
busy as yours.

30:11.645 --> 30:12.646
Paige is making it seem

30:12.646 --> 30:14.014
like I'm a bad friend and that

30:14.014 --> 30:15.415
I'm completely ignoring her this

30:15.415 --> 30:17.183
week, and I've been so busy, and

30:17.183 --> 30:18.819
any chance I have, I've hung out

30:18.819 --> 30:20.086
with her.

30:20.086 --> 30:21.154
I don't know where she's coming

30:21.154 --> 30:22.155
from with all this.

30:22.155 --> 30:23.189
I feel like I'm, like, feel bad,

30:23.189 --> 30:24.190
because I have a match.

30:24.190 --> 30:25.792
You know, like, I'm sorry, like,

30:25.792 --> 30:27.060
that I can't go around and,

30:27.060 --> 30:28.962
like, be a tourist.

30:28.962 --> 30:30.130
I'm sorry, it's, like, it's not

30:30.130 --> 30:31.898
my fault, like, I, you know, I

30:31.898 --> 30:32.899
have to wrestle.

30:32.899 --> 30:33.900
Okay. Well...

30:33.900 --> 30:34.901
So, like...

30:34.901 --> 30:35.902
All right, well, now,

30:35.902 --> 30:36.903
you see, that is the exact

30:36.903 --> 30:38.271
problem that I'm talking about.

30:38.271 --> 30:39.673
I can see now who my real

30:39.673 --> 30:40.874
friends are.

30:40.874 --> 30:41.975
You don't want to be my friend,

30:41.975 --> 30:43.209
because I can't wrestle anymore.

30:43.209 --> 30:44.210
I get it. I get it.

30:44.210 --> 30:45.211
That is not even close.

30:45.211 --> 30:46.379
I get it. No, no, no.

30:46.379 --> 30:47.380
I'll go do the cemetery thing

30:47.380 --> 30:48.615
myself; you keep being busy,

30:48.615 --> 30:49.683
baby girl, you keep being busy.

30:49.683 --> 30:50.183
I...

30:50.183 --> 30:51.184
You're doing stupid

30:51.184 --> 30:52.185
stuff and just blowing me off.

30:52.185 --> 30:53.186
It has nothing to do

30:53.186 --> 30:53.687
with that.

30:53.687 --> 30:54.688
No, no, I'm done.

30:54.688 --> 30:55.689
Don't you dare.

30:55.689 --> 30:56.690
Get back here.

30:56.690 --> 30:57.691
No.

30:57.691 --> 30:58.692
You get back here right

30:58.692 --> 31:00.400
now.

31:00.400 --> 31:01.501
Paige. She just kind of broke

31:01.501 --> 31:02.168
down.

31:02.168 --> 31:03.169
She's just like, "Well, you

31:03.169 --> 31:04.237
know, I feel like Trin thought

31:04.237 --> 31:05.238
I was being weird."

31:05.238 --> 31:06.239
Let me holla at you

31:06.239 --> 31:07.240
right quick, ol' sis.

31:07.240 --> 31:08.509
I got a sip of some tea.

31:08.509 --> 31:09.810
Is it gossip?

31:09.810 --> 31:10.644
I talked to Nia.

31:10.644 --> 31:11.477
I just feel you

31:11.477 --> 31:12.478
thought I was a weirdo, not that

31:12.478 --> 31:13.714
you, like, you didn't really

31:13.714 --> 31:15.281
hurt my feelings in a way where

31:15.281 --> 31:17.350
I was like, "What a bitch."

31:21.121 --> 31:22.122
You get back here right

31:22.122 --> 31:22.623
now.

31:22.623 --> 31:24.925
Hey, Paige! Hi, Nia!

31:24.925 --> 31:28.228
Seriously.

31:28.228 --> 31:29.930
I'm not... I don't...

31:29.930 --> 31:31.397
You don't realize

31:31.397 --> 31:32.398
right now, Nia, New Orleans is

31:32.398 --> 31:33.600
exactly where I debuted.

31:33.600 --> 31:35.301
I'm back here after being out

31:35.301 --> 31:36.637
for a year and a half, and now I

31:36.637 --> 31:37.137
can't wrestle.

31:37.137 --> 31:38.138
Yeah.

31:38.138 --> 31:39.139
And everything's

31:39.139 --> 31:40.140
being taken away from me right

31:40.140 --> 31:41.141
now.

31:41.141 --> 31:43.343
And all I want is to do stuff,

31:43.343 --> 31:46.980
to keep being, like...

31:46.980 --> 31:48.949
I know. I'm sorry, dude.

31:48.949 --> 31:50.584
And you know I'm‐‐ Oh!‐‐ you

31:50.584 --> 31:51.852
know I'm your biggest fan.

31:51.852 --> 31:52.919
You are one of the strongest

31:52.919 --> 31:53.920
people I know, and nothing

31:53.920 --> 31:54.420
holds you back.

31:54.420 --> 31:55.421
It's just hard to

31:55.421 --> 31:56.422
remain strong when you're in,

31:56.422 --> 31:58.091
like, a hotel full of people,

31:58.091 --> 31:59.092
full of fans, every single one

31:59.092 --> 32:00.066
of them's gone up to me, being

32:00.066 --> 32:01.067
like, "When are you getting in

32:01.067 --> 32:01.735
the ring again?

32:01.735 --> 32:02.736
When are you gonna do this?

32:02.736 --> 32:03.403
When are you gonna do that?"

32:03.403 --> 32:04.437
I don't know what to tell them,

32:04.437 --> 32:05.506
and then I see you guys.

32:05.506 --> 32:06.507
We go to have drinks, we go to

32:06.507 --> 32:07.508
have dinners, and everyone's

32:07.508 --> 32:08.509
talking about their

32:08.509 --> 32:09.510
WrestleMania, everyone's talking

32:09.510 --> 32:10.744
about their WrestleMania match,

32:10.744 --> 32:11.878
and I'm literally the only

32:11.878 --> 32:13.714
one being like, "Okay, cool,

32:13.714 --> 32:14.881
what do I do?" You know?

32:14.881 --> 32:16.082
And it's not jealousy.

32:16.082 --> 32:17.150
Like, I'm happy for you guys.

32:17.150 --> 32:18.151
I know you are.

32:18.151 --> 32:19.152
It's more just, like,

32:19.152 --> 32:20.153
I'm just sad.

32:20.153 --> 32:20.721
It's sad.

32:20.721 --> 32:21.722
I want to wrestle

32:21.722 --> 32:22.222
again.

32:22.222 --> 32:23.223
And, like, I'm looking at

32:23.223 --> 32:25.225
Trin... sometimes, and I just

32:25.225 --> 32:26.627
feel like she's ridiculing me

32:26.627 --> 32:27.628
all the time.

32:27.628 --> 32:28.995
Like, I'm a freak because I want

32:28.995 --> 32:30.363
to go see a voodoo person, I

32:30.363 --> 32:31.565
want to go see a psychic.

32:31.565 --> 32:32.566
Trust me, I've done everything I

32:32.566 --> 32:33.567
can.

32:33.567 --> 32:34.701
I've prayed to her god, you know

32:34.701 --> 32:35.201
what I mean?

32:35.201 --> 32:36.202
I've prayed, and it hasn't done

32:36.202 --> 32:38.505
anything for me.

32:38.505 --> 32:40.373
And so I'm trying everything in

32:40.373 --> 32:42.308
my power to get better again,

32:42.308 --> 32:43.309
because all I want to do is

32:43.309 --> 32:43.810
wrestle.

32:43.810 --> 32:44.811
I know.

32:44.811 --> 32:45.812
And everything's been

32:45.812 --> 32:46.813
taken away from me.

32:46.813 --> 32:47.814
I've definitely been trying to

32:47.814 --> 32:49.683
avoid the inevitable, you know,

32:49.683 --> 32:51.585
just because I don't want to

32:51.585 --> 32:52.586
think about it.

32:52.586 --> 32:54.320
Like, wrestling has been my

32:54.320 --> 32:56.523
life, literally my life; since

32:56.523 --> 32:58.058
the womb, I've been surrounded

32:58.058 --> 32:59.059
by wrestling.

32:59.059 --> 33:00.166
Like, WWE was supposed to not

33:00.166 --> 33:01.167
just be my passion, it was

33:01.167 --> 33:02.435
supposed to be my future, and,

33:02.435 --> 33:05.806
um, unfortunately, it was... cut

33:05.806 --> 33:06.807
short.

33:06.807 --> 33:07.808
Honestly, whatever you

33:07.808 --> 33:08.809
want to try‐‐ if you want to go

33:08.809 --> 33:09.810
to voodoo, if you want to do it,

33:09.810 --> 33:10.343
like, any psychic...

33:10.343 --> 33:11.344
I just feel like I

33:11.344 --> 33:12.478
piled it all up after, like,

33:12.478 --> 33:12.979
this week.

33:12.979 --> 33:13.980
Yeah.

33:13.980 --> 33:14.715
Just, like, I'm like,

33:14.715 --> 33:15.716
"Great, no one wants to hang out

33:15.716 --> 33:16.717
with me, 'cause I don't wrestle

33:16.717 --> 33:17.217
anymore."

33:17.217 --> 33:18.218
I wish you would have

33:18.218 --> 33:19.219
told me that earlier, then I

33:19.219 --> 33:20.220
would have definitely not have

33:20.220 --> 33:22.523
been... so insensitive.

33:22.523 --> 33:25.025
I'm sorry I'm busy this week.

33:25.025 --> 33:28.061
But I am here for you.

33:28.061 --> 33:29.129
♪ Whoa

33:29.129 --> 33:30.931
Can you hear the sound?

33:30.931 --> 33:33.133
♪ We're getting all dressed up

33:33.133 --> 33:35.068
To get on down... ♪

33:35.068 --> 33:36.269
A lot of

33:36.269 --> 33:37.804
anticipation in the air here

33:37.804 --> 33:38.805
tonight.

33:38.805 --> 33:39.806
This is what it's all gonna come

33:39.806 --> 33:40.807
down to.

33:40.807 --> 33:43.744
The class of 2018 right here on

33:43.744 --> 33:46.046
the WWE Hall of Fame Red Carpet

33:46.046 --> 33:47.047
Show.

33:47.047 --> 33:48.048
Hall of Fame is

33:48.048 --> 33:49.315
special, because it's a time to

33:49.315 --> 33:51.251
honor and celebrate those who

33:51.251 --> 33:53.453
paved the way and accomplished

33:53.453 --> 33:54.588
the things that we're all

33:54.588 --> 33:55.856
working towards and doing right

33:55.856 --> 33:57.123
now in our career.

33:57.123 --> 33:58.759
It's just a special night.

33:58.759 --> 33:59.760
Itty‐bitty titty committee.

33:59.760 --> 34:00.767
This is a big titty

34:00.767 --> 34:01.768
committee.

34:01.768 --> 34:02.803
Big, big, big titty

34:02.803 --> 34:03.804
committee...

34:03.804 --> 34:04.871
A big, big, big titty

34:04.871 --> 34:06.039
committee.

34:06.039 --> 34:06.840
I'm rooting for you

34:06.840 --> 34:07.841
to win the title on Sunday.

34:07.841 --> 34:08.708
And if she doesn't win, I'm

34:08.708 --> 34:09.409
gonna riot.

34:09.409 --> 34:10.143
Thanks, guys.

34:10.143 --> 34:10.944
It's your time.

34:10.944 --> 34:11.945
It's your time.

34:11.945 --> 34:12.946
I've been so stressed

34:12.946 --> 34:14.313
and freaking out and, like, just

34:14.313 --> 34:15.315
wanting to make sure all these

34:15.315 --> 34:16.315
things done.

34:16.315 --> 34:17.784
Like, I didn't even, like, think

34:17.784 --> 34:19.119
about how it would be affecting,

34:19.119 --> 34:20.120
like, Paige.

34:20.120 --> 34:21.722
She debuted here.

34:21.722 --> 34:23.289
She won the championship here.

34:23.289 --> 34:24.090
Yeah.

34:24.090 --> 34:25.091
You know what I mean?

34:25.091 --> 34:25.958
Like, this is, like, the

34:25.958 --> 34:27.027
beginning for her.

34:27.027 --> 34:28.027
I didn't even think

34:28.027 --> 34:28.862
about that.

34:28.862 --> 34:29.862
Yeah. She's really

34:29.862 --> 34:31.496
trying to, like, see a psychic,

34:31.496 --> 34:32.733
see voodoo, like, whatever she

34:32.733 --> 34:33.734
can do to try to heal.

34:33.734 --> 34:34.735
Right.

34:34.735 --> 34:35.569
She just kind of broke

34:35.569 --> 34:36.570
down, and she's just like,

34:36.570 --> 34:37.571
"Well, you know, I feel like

34:37.571 --> 34:38.572
Trin thought I was being weird

34:38.572 --> 34:40.005
and, you know, that she's just,

34:40.005 --> 34:41.007
like..."

34:41.007 --> 34:42.007
No! I would never

34:42.007 --> 34:44.409
think she's being weird.

34:44.409 --> 34:46.279
It's just not my preference, but

34:46.279 --> 34:48.447
I'm all for whatever she needs

34:48.447 --> 34:50.016
in her life or what makes her

34:50.016 --> 34:51.016
happy and what makes her feel

34:51.016 --> 34:51.784
good.

34:51.784 --> 34:52.553
Yeah.

34:52.553 --> 34:53.319
I would never judge

34:53.319 --> 34:54.087
her for that.

34:54.087 --> 34:54.855
Yeah. Exactly.

34:54.855 --> 34:55.621
So I got to let her

34:55.621 --> 34:56.289
know that...

34:56.289 --> 34:57.056
You're being called to

34:57.056 --> 34:57.724
the red carpet.

34:57.724 --> 34:58.525
All right.

34:58.525 --> 34:59.292
Okay, thanks, Ni.

34:59.292 --> 35:00.200
You look beautiful.

35:00.200 --> 35:01.201
Best‐dressed couple

35:01.201 --> 35:02.035
alert.

35:02.035 --> 35:02.869
Look at this.

35:02.869 --> 35:03.870
I made it myself.

35:03.870 --> 35:04.938
That's how I do it.

35:04.938 --> 35:06.272
A month ago, you were

35:06.272 --> 35:08.008
the general manager of <i>SmackDown</i>

35:08.008 --> 35:09.943
Live,and now you are on the

35:09.943 --> 35:11.678
verge of returning at

35:11.678 --> 35:13.547
WrestleMania.

35:13.547 --> 35:14.548
I haven't slept.

35:14.548 --> 35:16.082
I'm a little just, like...

35:16.082 --> 35:17.350
What's the matter?

35:17.350 --> 35:18.351
A huge championship match on the

35:18.351 --> 35:19.252
line?

35:19.252 --> 35:20.253
It's just, it's one of

35:20.253 --> 35:21.588
those... I don't know.

35:21.588 --> 35:22.923
It's all hitting me all at once.

35:22.923 --> 35:24.190
And I'm, like, ready to, like...

35:24.190 --> 35:26.192
I'm ready to climb under a rock.

35:26.192 --> 35:28.595
I'm extremely nervous because I

35:28.595 --> 35:29.796
still feel like I'm still so new

35:29.796 --> 35:30.797
to this company.

35:30.797 --> 35:31.798
Like, am I gonna be able to make

35:31.798 --> 35:32.799
it?

35:32.799 --> 35:34.034
And it's a singles match.

35:34.034 --> 35:35.435
Like, how many women can say

35:35.435 --> 35:36.469
they had a singles match at

35:36.469 --> 35:37.571
WrestleMania for the title?
