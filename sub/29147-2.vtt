00:01.535 --> 00:03.769
<i>-Previously on</i> BH90210...
-That's my dress!

00:03.804 --> 00:06.538
<i>This is the time</i>
<i>to do a reboot.</i>

00:06.574 --> 00:08.374
Wasn't Vegas enough punishment?

00:08.409 --> 00:09.942
And that was without Shannen.

00:09.977 --> 00:11.443
And I don't need
acting advice from you.

00:11.479 --> 00:13.746
All you'll ever be
is Brandon Walsh.

00:15.916 --> 00:18.083
<i>We got a great relationship,
the perfect marriage.</i>

00:18.119 --> 00:19.852
Okay.

00:19.887 --> 00:22.021
-Is that my phone?
-Mm-hmm.

00:22.056 --> 00:24.023
Andrea Zuckerman
was my first crush.

00:24.058 --> 00:26.258
<i>Hi, Brian.</i>

00:26.293 --> 00:28.794
-Hi. -Do you know when Shay's
new album is gonna drop?

00:28.829 --> 00:32.131
Any other questions...
that do not involve my wife?

00:32.165 --> 00:33.699
<i>Do you ever wonder</i>

00:33.734 --> 00:36.268
what our lives would be like
if we hadn't done that show?

00:36.303 --> 00:38.237
Every single day.

00:43.577 --> 00:45.210
I'm pregnant.

00:52.186 --> 00:55.421
Kel, are you okay? I heard Tara
held you at gunpoint.

00:55.456 --> 00:58.657
Are you on diet pills again?
We talked about this, Kel.

00:58.692 --> 01:01.293
Hey, if you go to that frat
party, you're gonna get burned.

01:01.328 --> 01:02.428
You have to quit

01:02.463 --> 01:04.629
The New Evolution.
They're brainwashing you.

01:04.665 --> 01:07.132
<i>Students of West Beverly,</i>

01:07.168 --> 01:09.468
<i>I've just received word</i>
<i>that Kelly Taylor was shot</i>

01:09.503 --> 01:10.836
<i>in the parking lot at LAX.</i>

01:10.871 --> 01:12.838
It is shocking and sad,

01:12.873 --> 01:14.907
and this one goes out to her.

01:17.845 --> 01:19.645
Kelly's dead?

01:21.215 --> 01:22.915
Kelly's dead!

01:28.155 --> 01:29.688
Whatever, Mom.

01:29.723 --> 01:31.924
Lots of people dream about
being back in high school.

01:31.959 --> 01:33.826
You don't need
to be so dramatic.

01:33.861 --> 01:35.794
This whole reboot idea
has me so freaked out.

01:35.830 --> 01:37.796
Right, 'cause being on a show
where you get paid

01:37.832 --> 01:41.300
a zillion dollars
is really that traumatic.

01:41.335 --> 01:45.170
It was traumatic, and it wasn't
zillions of dollars,

01:45.206 --> 01:48.273
so why don't you ease up
on the online shopping?

01:48.309 --> 01:50.375
Well, I think it sounds fun.
I mean, how many people get

01:50.411 --> 01:53.011
-a chance at a do-over?
-What is this?

01:53.047 --> 01:55.280
I was gonna tell you about that.

01:55.316 --> 01:56.381
Looks like a script.

01:56.417 --> 01:59.218
There is, um,
there's an audition that I...

01:59.253 --> 02:01.553
It's just a part that I think
I'm really right for.

02:01.589 --> 02:02.721
We've talked about this, Kyler.

02:02.756 --> 02:04.189
No acting.
Conversation's closed.

02:04.225 --> 02:06.792
Okay, well,
can we reopen the conversation?

02:06.827 --> 02:08.660
Sure. After your 18th birthday.

02:08.696 --> 02:10.929
Well, then, can I please have
the script back?

02:14.902 --> 02:16.802
-I'll trade you.
-What is that?

02:16.837 --> 02:18.003
I don't know. Came this morning.

02:21.175 --> 02:23.041
Have a good day.

02:23.077 --> 02:25.144
Yep.

02:27.000 --> 02:33.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:40.861 --> 02:42.194
So he's actually
going through with it?

02:42.229 --> 02:44.763
Mm-hmm.
That makes divorce number three.

02:44.798 --> 02:46.698
-Up high.
-Hmm.

02:46.734 --> 02:49.067
He wasn't good enough for you.

02:49.103 --> 02:50.836
Ladies.

02:50.871 --> 02:52.371
Welcome back to Fox.

02:52.406 --> 02:53.705
We're excited
to hear your pitch.

03:00.981 --> 03:02.114
<i>It doesn't seem very smart</i>

03:02.149 --> 03:04.750
<i>for me to leave my wallet</i>
<i>at a crime s...</i>

03:04.785 --> 03:07.519
So, why are we showing you this?

03:07.555 --> 03:09.555
Certainly not
my proudest moment,

03:09.590 --> 03:13.125
and I don't plan on committing
theft again, any time soon.

03:13.160 --> 03:18.197
But this video right here got
five million views in 24 hours.

03:18.232 --> 03:20.899
Everyone wants to see
the <i> 90210</i> cast together,

03:20.935 --> 03:22.367
even after all these years.

03:22.403 --> 03:24.036
This is why we think

03:24.071 --> 03:26.738
that now is the time
for a <i> real</i> reboot.

03:28.943 --> 03:30.209
Well, I love this idea.

03:30.244 --> 03:32.477
It's no secret, I'm a huge fan.

03:32.513 --> 03:35.214
I had an entire set of the cast
dolls in middle school.

03:35.249 --> 03:37.049
Still haven't forgiven my mother
for throwing them out

03:37.084 --> 03:38.383
when I left for college.

03:38.419 --> 03:41.286
I happen to have an entire set
in my storage.

03:41.322 --> 03:45.724
I mean, it was <i> the</i> Christmas
gift of 1992, wasn't it, Jen?

03:45.759 --> 03:47.993
Right up there with fanny packs.

03:48.028 --> 03:49.394
We'd love to do
the show with you.

03:49.430 --> 03:50.462
-You would?
-Really?

03:50.497 --> 03:51.964
All of you together again...

03:51.999 --> 03:53.165
it is too good to pass up.

03:53.200 --> 03:55.133
Too good to be
true, I would have said.

03:55.169 --> 03:56.768
How'd you get everyone on board?

03:56.804 --> 03:59.104
Wh-When you say "everyone..."

03:59.139 --> 04:00.772
You do have them all, right?

04:00.808 --> 04:02.341
Well, we, uh...

04:02.376 --> 04:03.508
They wouldn't have come in

04:03.544 --> 04:04.843
with this pitch if they didn't.

04:04.878 --> 04:07.613
So, how soon can you get
the whole cast in here?

04:07.648 --> 04:10.415
-Soon.
-Ish. Uh, we're actually

04:10.451 --> 04:11.850
seeing everyone later today.

04:15.289 --> 04:17.122
Hi. Hi... oh.

04:17.156 --> 04:19.992
I love you, too.
Thank you for all your support.

04:20.027 --> 04:22.327
Okay, can you stop being
such a publicity whore?

04:22.363 --> 04:24.263
Why? It's what I do best.

04:24.298 --> 04:26.331
Look at this.
It's like a red carpet.

04:26.367 --> 04:27.699
Yeah, with metal detectors.

04:27.735 --> 04:29.268
This is the perfect timing

04:29.303 --> 04:31.270
to pitch them
the reboot afterwards,

04:31.305 --> 04:33.639
'cause they're already
feeling the love.

04:33.674 --> 04:35.507
Jennie,
one with you and Jason? -Oh...

04:35.542 --> 04:38.210
Ah, sure. Looking good, Jen.

04:38.245 --> 04:39.711
You, too.
A little puffy, though.

04:39.747 --> 04:41.647
You have Chinese food
last night?

04:41.682 --> 04:43.649
Can't we just be
adults about this?

04:43.684 --> 04:45.450
Mm. Can't you just take
your hand off my back

04:45.486 --> 04:47.953
before I gouge
your eyes out? Thanks.

04:47.988 --> 04:49.721
Good talk.

04:51.925 --> 04:53.959
Jason,
can you sign this, please?

04:53.994 --> 04:55.661
- Hey, Z. Hey.
- Hey, buddy.

04:55.696 --> 04:58.297
-Talk to Stacey about
what happened yet? -Nope.

04:58.332 --> 05:01.133
Not planning to. At least not
without a lawyer present.

05:01.168 --> 05:03.001
- There you go.
- Thank you so much.

05:03.037 --> 05:04.569
- Anyone else? Hey, buddy.
- Over here.

05:04.605 --> 05:06.471
Jennie, Jennie, over here!

05:09.410 --> 05:11.176
That is not the best picture

05:11.211 --> 05:12.878
I've ever taken, but...

05:12.913 --> 05:14.212
...I'll sign it anyway.

05:14.248 --> 05:16.548
I love you, Brian.

05:16.583 --> 05:19.751
I'll sign that one... hey, how
you doing? I'll sign this one...

05:19.787 --> 05:21.653
-Gabrielle!
-Gabrielle!

05:21.689 --> 05:23.922
Gab.

05:23.957 --> 05:26.658
-What's her problem?
-Wow.

05:26.694 --> 05:29.828
All right, guys, thank you.

05:29.863 --> 05:31.863
Larceny,
destruction of property,

05:31.899 --> 05:35.200
public drunkenness,
public urination.

05:35.235 --> 05:36.435
That is disgusting.

05:36.470 --> 05:38.036
Why would you assume
that was me?

05:38.072 --> 05:40.372
You just love to
mark your territory, don't you?

05:40.407 --> 05:42.708
Would you two just get a room?

05:42.743 --> 05:43.875
Your behavior is deplorable.

05:43.911 --> 05:46.878
You should all be very ashamed
of yourselves.

05:46.914 --> 05:48.780
We agree, Your Honor.

05:48.816 --> 05:50.115
Well, fortunately for all of us,

05:50.150 --> 05:52.617
your defense attorney
was persuasive enough...

05:52.653 --> 05:53.785
Your Honor?

05:53.821 --> 05:54.953
I object.

05:54.988 --> 05:57.022
...to get the D.A.

05:57.057 --> 05:59.124
to drop most
of the criminal charges.

05:59.159 --> 06:00.359
Oh.

06:00.394 --> 06:02.527
Okay. Thank you.

06:02.563 --> 06:04.730
Um, actually,
can I say something?

06:04.765 --> 06:06.198
What is she doing?

06:06.233 --> 06:08.066
Babe, clamp it.

06:08.102 --> 06:10.736
I would like
to state for the record

06:10.771 --> 06:13.705
that I acted alone,

06:13.741 --> 06:16.375
and none of my fellow
codefendants

06:16.410 --> 06:17.943
should have to answer
for my crime.

06:17.978 --> 06:20.912
Well, very honorable of
you, but you can save

06:20.948 --> 06:23.382
that stipulation
for the civil case

06:23.417 --> 06:25.917
with the owner of the dress,
Mr. Johnson Deitz.

06:28.655 --> 06:29.988
I'm really sorry, sir,

06:30.023 --> 06:31.923
-that I stole your dress.
-Mr. Deitz

06:31.959 --> 06:33.925
cannot comment, Ms. Spelling.

06:33.961 --> 06:35.660
But he will be
seeking compensation

06:35.696 --> 06:37.996
in the neighborhood of $100,000.

06:38.031 --> 06:39.231
-Okay, now I object.
-A hundred grand?

06:39.266 --> 06:40.632
You can't be serious.

06:40.667 --> 06:43.268
- That dress is polyester.
- In addition,

06:43.303 --> 06:46.405
Ms. Spelling, you will
personally return the dress

06:46.440 --> 06:48.306
in question to Mr. Deitz...

06:49.610 --> 06:52.944
- ...unlaundered.
- Ew...

06:52.980 --> 06:53.945
Oh.

06:55.349 --> 06:58.283
-May I approach the bench?
-No, you may not,

06:58.318 --> 06:59.751
and I am out of patience.

06:59.787 --> 07:01.753
So, for the remaining charge
of larceny,

07:01.789 --> 07:03.755
the court sentences each of you

07:03.791 --> 07:05.657
to 50 hours
of community service...

07:05.692 --> 07:06.858
What?

07:06.894 --> 07:09.494
...and we are adjourned here.

07:09.530 --> 07:10.529
Thanks, Tori.

07:17.471 --> 07:19.304
Ugh, that was humiliating.

07:19.339 --> 07:21.873
Wait! Guys.

07:21.909 --> 07:24.709
I, I just wanted
to thank you for being here.

07:24.745 --> 07:26.511
I-I mean,
I know you had no choice

07:26.547 --> 07:28.680
because you were named
in the suit...

07:28.715 --> 07:32.517
--...but it
means a lot to me, and...

07:32.553 --> 07:36.154
-I'd like to make it up to you.
-Oh, really? How?

07:36.190 --> 07:37.889
By doing all the community
service work for us?

07:37.925 --> 07:39.224
That would be a good start.

07:39.259 --> 07:43.795
I was thinking more
like a business proposition.

07:43.831 --> 07:46.631
We have a huge opportunity
right now,

07:46.667 --> 07:48.200
and I want
to talk to you about it,

07:48.235 --> 07:50.001
because we have a chance
at a do-over.

07:50.037 --> 07:53.071
We could be great together.
I mean, we were great together.

07:53.106 --> 07:55.674
Do you remember how great
we used to be together?

07:55.709 --> 07:56.708
And we could be
great again together.

07:56.743 --> 07:58.310
-Greatness can be ours.
-She wants us all

07:58.345 --> 08:00.011
to do a <i> 90210</i> reboot.

08:00.047 --> 08:01.680
What she said.

08:08.789 --> 08:10.188
Come on.

09:08.448 --> 09:11.249
-You can't be serious.
-I am. And so is Fox.

09:11.285 --> 09:13.018
This could be huge.

09:13.053 --> 09:15.220
You saw all the fans up there
waiting for us.

09:15.255 --> 09:18.456
And... there's money
to be made here.

09:19.593 --> 09:21.560
This can be fun, too.

09:21.595 --> 09:23.228
-Guys?
-Yeah.

09:23.263 --> 09:24.563
Please, guys, I need this.

09:28.135 --> 09:31.469
I-I stood up in court for you.

09:31.505 --> 09:33.271
- I took a bullet for you.
- Oh, my God,

09:33.307 --> 09:35.574
- you shot the gun.
- Yeah, I don't think so, T.

09:35.609 --> 09:37.042
The last thing
I want to do is put on

09:37.077 --> 09:38.643
a Peach Pit uniform again.

09:38.679 --> 09:39.978
I'm getting a divorce.

09:40.013 --> 09:41.646
I got to prove
my wife is cheating

09:41.682 --> 09:43.882
to trigger the fidelity clause
in my prenup.

09:43.917 --> 09:45.250
I'm not signing
any five-year contract

09:45.285 --> 09:46.785
if she's gonna get half.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.887
Bri?

09:48.922 --> 09:49.888
You want to get back

09:49.923 --> 09:51.890
- into acting, right?
- Totally.

09:51.925 --> 09:55.160
You know what's super sexy?
A middle-aged white rapper.

09:55.195 --> 09:57.095
I want to try for movies, Tor.

09:58.165 --> 09:59.598
Gab?

10:00.801 --> 10:02.434
We had fun in Vegas.

10:02.469 --> 10:03.969
We're in the courthouse
because of Vegas.

10:04.004 --> 10:05.170
Hmm.

10:05.205 --> 10:07.238
And you'll never get Shannen.

10:07.274 --> 10:10.108
-Good luck, Tori.
-See you in another 30 years.

10:13.213 --> 10:16.581
Yeah...

10:16.617 --> 10:18.617
we always knew it was
a long shot.

10:20.654 --> 10:22.721
Come on.

10:31.131 --> 10:34.866
Hey, babe.
What are you doing, exactly?

10:34.901 --> 10:37.469
I am strategizing how to get
the rest of the cast

10:37.504 --> 10:38.970
on board for this reboot.

10:39.006 --> 10:40.605
Isn't this a little extreme?

10:40.641 --> 10:43.708
Extreme is the $100,000
in damages

10:43.744 --> 10:45.677
that we owe my creepster
number-one fan.

10:45.712 --> 10:46.945
I have to make this reboot work.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.613
T, they said no.

10:48.649 --> 10:50.548
No never stopped my dad.

10:50.584 --> 10:53.718
Do you know what happened
when he had this crazy idea

10:53.754 --> 10:57.389
to pitch a show about
three sexy female detectives?

10:57.424 --> 10:58.623
No. What happened?

10:58.659 --> 10:59.791
They told him it wouldn't work,

10:59.826 --> 11:01.626
and he refused
to take no for an answer.

11:01.662 --> 11:02.861
Wait,<i> Charlie's Angels?</i>

11:02.896 --> 11:06.031
Yep. 'Cause my dad
was persistent.

11:06.066 --> 11:09.801
And sometimes he threatened
to buy the studio.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.369
Obviously,
that can't happen here.

11:11.405 --> 11:13.471
And clearly, money management...
not genetic.

11:13.507 --> 11:17.409
He always found
a way to make it happen.

11:17.444 --> 11:19.010
T, a show of this size
would be almost impossible

11:19.046 --> 11:20.412
for you to manage.

11:20.447 --> 11:22.814
I mean, it's like fighting a
forest fire with a garden hose.

11:22.849 --> 11:24.916
Are you saying
that I can't do this?

11:24.951 --> 11:28.987
No. I'm saying
that you're incredible.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.523
And you're amazing, but maybe

11:31.558 --> 11:33.358
producing isn't genetic.

11:42.369 --> 11:44.602
Okay, there's one thing I like
about being pregnant.

11:44.638 --> 11:46.571
That we get a baby
at the end of it?

11:46.606 --> 11:47.739
Was gonna say eating carbs.

11:49.042 --> 11:51.843
It's Tori.

11:51.878 --> 11:54.512
She won't give up
on this stupid reboot idea.

11:54.548 --> 11:56.748
What's wrong with that?
Reboots are hot right now.

11:56.783 --> 11:59.851
Playing Brandon Walsh again is
the last thing I want to do.

11:59.886 --> 12:01.853
All right, come on, babe,

12:01.888 --> 12:03.121
let's think
of the possibilities here.

12:03.156 --> 12:05.457
Brandon and Kelly back together.

12:05.492 --> 12:07.692
-People would eat it up.
-Mm.

12:07.728 --> 12:09.961
Plus, a steady acting gig
could be perfect.

12:09.996 --> 12:11.463
For all of us.

12:15.168 --> 12:16.634
You okay?

12:16.670 --> 12:20.038
Yeah, just, um... I just got
a little nauseous.

12:20.073 --> 12:22.073
I'm gonna...
I need some fresh air, okay?

12:22.109 --> 12:23.975
All right.

12:26.012 --> 12:27.312
Are you crazy?

12:27.347 --> 12:28.813
I told you
you can't just come here.

12:28.849 --> 12:31.216
And you can't just ignore
my calls; we need to talk.

12:31.251 --> 12:33.718
-I have nothing to say to you.
-Maybe not.

12:33.754 --> 12:35.386
But you do have
something I want.

12:35.422 --> 12:37.655
You're a publicist,
you have connections.

12:37.691 --> 12:39.758
Do one thing for me,
and your little secret

12:39.793 --> 12:41.626
stays a secret.

12:46.433 --> 12:49.300
Don't ever come back here again.

12:53.106 --> 12:54.506
Oh.

12:54.541 --> 12:55.907
You scared the crap
out of me, Mom.

12:55.942 --> 12:58.276
Good. Your school called.

12:58.311 --> 12:59.911
Tell me you didn't go
on that audition.

12:59.946 --> 13:01.946
I did, and I booked it.

13:03.784 --> 13:05.250
"Drunk cheerleader."

13:05.285 --> 13:06.251
It's really hard
to play a good drunk,

13:06.286 --> 13:07.352
and I nailed it.

13:07.387 --> 13:08.920
Oh, please, I could
do that in my sleep.

13:08.955 --> 13:10.755
-This isn't about you.
-No.

13:10.791 --> 13:14.092
-It's about you and how
grounded you are. -Mom!

13:14.127 --> 13:15.927
I said no acting.

13:15.962 --> 13:18.296
Not while you're under my roof.

13:23.303 --> 13:27.038
I feel you, Peanut.

13:27.073 --> 13:31.843
It's hard enough to be punished
for being who you are,

13:31.878 --> 13:34.512
but for being who you aren't...

13:36.416 --> 13:39.017
But you're strong.
You'll get through this.

13:40.987 --> 13:44.122
Now come on over here,
give me some of that love.

13:44.157 --> 13:45.824
That was great, Brian.

13:45.859 --> 13:47.492
Nah, that blew.

13:47.527 --> 13:50.461
I didn't connect
to the comedy at all.

13:50.497 --> 13:51.896
I mean, is this a comedy
or is it a drama?

13:51.932 --> 13:54.499
This almost reads
like it doesn't really know

13:54.534 --> 13:55.633
what it is.

13:55.669 --> 13:57.669
I'll share your thoughts
with the writer.

13:57.704 --> 13:59.137
No, no, no, don't...

13:59.172 --> 14:00.839
I don't...
I don't want to be rude,

14:00.874 --> 14:03.508
I just...

14:03.543 --> 14:05.910
Just being rude.

14:05.946 --> 14:08.046
So this is going great.

14:08.081 --> 14:10.715
-Can I do it again?
-We're good.

14:12.719 --> 14:15.987
All right. Thank you
for having me in.

14:16.022 --> 14:17.655
Thank you.

14:17.691 --> 14:19.357
How soon could you be
in Atlanta?

14:21.461 --> 14:23.595
Welcome to the cast.

14:23.630 --> 14:25.230
What?

14:25.265 --> 14:27.665
Looking forward
to working with you.

14:27.701 --> 14:29.934
Are you sure?

14:29.970 --> 14:31.069
Say hi to Shay.

14:31.104 --> 14:32.704
Can't wait to see
what she comes up with.

14:34.541 --> 14:36.841
I will.
Thank you.

14:36.877 --> 14:38.576
Lucky man.

14:40.614 --> 14:44.015
Not one single person
has called me back.

14:44.050 --> 14:46.251
I am officially
the worst producer

14:46.286 --> 14:48.086
-in the entire world.
-Mm.

14:48.121 --> 14:49.754
Well, at least you're not
the worst mother

14:49.789 --> 14:52.190
-in the entire world,
'cause that's my title. -Trust me,

14:52.225 --> 14:54.525
if they're mad at you,
you're doing something right.

14:54.561 --> 14:57.695
I took away Emma's tablet for,
like, one hour last week.

14:57.731 --> 14:58.897
She's still giving me 'tude.

14:58.932 --> 15:01.766
Oh, shoot, that reminds me.

15:01.801 --> 15:02.867
Okay...

15:02.903 --> 15:05.770
I have to change Declan's tutor

15:05.805 --> 15:07.872
from Monday to Friday.

15:07.908 --> 15:10.875
And that means I can put
Emma's karate...

15:10.911 --> 15:12.310
Okay, field trip. Shoot.

15:12.345 --> 15:15.213
Sign the field trip form.

15:15.248 --> 15:17.582
Signed, dated, done.

15:17.617 --> 15:19.384
That's impressive.

15:19.419 --> 15:22.420
You know what would be
impressive?

15:22.455 --> 15:25.723
Getting one phone call back.
Super impressive?

15:25.759 --> 15:27.458
Getting the entire cast
to sign on.

15:27.494 --> 15:30.962
But no, not one call.
Producer fail.

15:30.997 --> 15:32.563
Okay, you know what,
you've got to stop doing that.

15:32.599 --> 15:35.400
-What? What? Cooking?
-No.

15:35.435 --> 15:37.168
Being so hard on yourself.

15:37.203 --> 15:38.636
Uh, look what you do.

15:38.672 --> 15:40.939
You keep
six little people alive.

15:40.974 --> 15:42.073
That's not easy.

15:42.108 --> 15:44.943
No, it's not easy.

15:49.549 --> 15:53.251
In fact, most days it is like

15:53.286 --> 15:55.954
putting out a forest fire
with a garden hose.

15:57.624 --> 16:00.291
-I got this.
-What?

16:00.327 --> 16:03.361
Charlie just needs some angels.

16:05.732 --> 16:10.001
Right after I change
this poopy diaper.

16:10.036 --> 16:12.637
-BRB.
-Have fun with that.

16:18.878 --> 16:20.945
I know you want to distance
yourself from this character,

16:20.980 --> 16:22.680
and I respect that.

16:22.716 --> 16:24.215
Why don't you have
a membership here?

16:24.250 --> 16:26.017
I've been on the waiting list
for, like, two years.

16:26.052 --> 16:28.019
-Ah. -I also know you want
to focus on directing.

16:28.054 --> 16:29.020
Again, I respect that.

16:29.055 --> 16:30.188
You know, as a founding member,

16:30.223 --> 16:32.190
I could move you up
on that list.

16:32.225 --> 16:33.224
Can you front my dues?

16:35.228 --> 16:37.628
Anyway, this is a big TV pilot,

16:37.664 --> 16:40.064
so a directing gig...
pretty sweet.

16:40.100 --> 16:41.933
What, are you saying,
if I sign on to the project,

16:41.968 --> 16:43.067
I could direct the pilot?

16:43.103 --> 16:45.269
If you could,
would you reconsider?

16:45.305 --> 16:46.471
Well, it would definitely
move the needle.

16:46.506 --> 16:48.706
I can talk to the network.

16:48.742 --> 16:50.074
I like the sound of that.

16:52.746 --> 16:55.413
Aw, congratulations. Oh...

16:55.448 --> 16:57.081
-Support her head.
Support her head. -Hey, Gab,

16:57.117 --> 16:58.483
I've held plenty of babies.

16:58.518 --> 17:01.052
I'm gonna be holding
my own soon enough.

17:06.960 --> 17:09.394
You okay?

17:09.429 --> 17:11.061
That stupid actor I punched...

17:11.097 --> 17:12.630
he's costing me jobs.

17:12.665 --> 17:15.098
Apparently, I'm not even allowed
to direct myself anymore.

17:15.135 --> 17:16.666
Wait, you want to do
the reboot now?

17:16.703 --> 17:17.902
If I can direct the pilot, sure.

17:17.936 --> 17:20.070
It'd be good for me,
good for my family.

17:20.106 --> 17:24.675
Oh, I'm not gonna offer.
You got to ask... nicely.

17:24.711 --> 17:26.676
All right.

17:26.713 --> 17:29.647
Gab, can you please
pull some strings

17:29.682 --> 17:31.449
with the Actors Guild?

17:31.484 --> 17:33.584
I really need that little
teenage douchebag

17:33.620 --> 17:34.919
to drop his complaint.

17:34.954 --> 17:36.954
I said nicely.

17:36.990 --> 17:38.790
I said please.

17:40.627 --> 17:41.959
I don't pull strings.

17:42.962 --> 17:45.596
But I do set up mediations.

17:45.632 --> 17:47.098
Love you.

17:47.133 --> 17:49.100
I know you do.

17:49.135 --> 17:51.302
Okay, you just better never
touch another actor again,

17:51.337 --> 17:53.304
or I will beat the crap
out of you.

17:53.339 --> 17:54.939
Yeah, I know.

17:54.974 --> 17:56.274
Sorry to lay
all my problems on you

17:56.309 --> 17:59.277
when you have so much
to be happy for.

17:59.312 --> 18:01.279
It's all right,
I got my own troubles...

18:01.314 --> 18:03.981
Oh, my God, I'm kind of caught
in the middle of something

18:04.017 --> 18:05.983
since Vegas myself.

18:06.019 --> 18:08.553
Oh, my God, did Jennie tell you?

18:08.588 --> 18:09.821
Tell me what?

18:11.324 --> 18:13.958
Jay, did you sleep
with Jennie in Vegas?

18:13.993 --> 18:16.828
Well, we didn't exactly sleep.

18:16.863 --> 18:18.396
Look, it was a one-time thing.

18:18.431 --> 18:20.231
It was a drunken mistake.

18:21.668 --> 18:23.801
I guess Vegas was made
for those.

18:23.837 --> 18:28.306
Wha...?
Did <i> you</i> do something in Vegas?

18:28.341 --> 18:31.209
-Mm...
-What did you do?

18:31.244 --> 18:36.647
I, uh... I kissed someone who...

18:36.683 --> 18:38.316
who was a woman.

18:38.351 --> 18:40.885
Oh... Wow.

18:40.920 --> 18:42.887
That's new.

18:42.922 --> 18:46.357
Well, Jay, it's not exactly
new feelings.

18:47.360 --> 18:50.595
Well, I think that's great.

18:50.630 --> 18:53.764
But what made you, you know,

18:53.800 --> 18:55.199
this time?

18:55.235 --> 18:56.367
Like, why now?

18:58.204 --> 19:00.204
Just holding her.

19:01.474 --> 19:03.908
Wanting her to be
her most authentic self

19:03.943 --> 19:05.710
and realizing what kind
of hypocrite would I be

19:05.745 --> 19:07.879
if-if I didn't do that myself?

19:08.982 --> 19:10.948
Jay, I have been totally
freaking out.

19:10.984 --> 19:13.518
The one person who I would
normally talk to this about

19:13.553 --> 19:16.587
is the one person who's most
likely to be hurt by this.

19:23.229 --> 19:24.962
All right, I know
we've been here all day,

19:24.998 --> 19:28.032
but I'm a perfectionist,
so one more time from the top.

19:28.067 --> 19:30.868
- And keep it sexy.

19:30.904 --> 19:32.603
Five, six, seven, eight.

19:32.639 --> 19:35.206
Go. I like this.

19:35.241 --> 19:37.241
Now sexy. Sexy.

19:37.277 --> 19:38.643
Yes.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.411
Here's our part, turn.

19:40.446 --> 19:42.880
Pop, pop, pop. Yes!

19:42.916 --> 19:43.881
So good.

19:43.917 --> 19:44.949
-Shay.
-Feel it...

19:44.984 --> 19:46.551
Hey, Bri.

19:46.586 --> 19:48.452
Did you promise the producers
of the movie a song

19:48.488 --> 19:49.587
if they hired me?

19:49.622 --> 19:51.088
Girls, take five real quick.

19:52.959 --> 19:55.459
You're not excited that we're
gonna be in a movie together?

19:55.495 --> 19:56.827
Just answer the question, Shay.

19:56.863 --> 19:59.830
I answered the question, Bri.

19:59.866 --> 20:02.567
You wanted to be in the movie,
and they wanted my song.

20:02.602 --> 20:03.801
What's the big deal?

20:03.836 --> 20:06.337
So they're doing you a favor
by hiring me.

20:06.372 --> 20:08.005
No, it's not that blatant.

20:08.041 --> 20:10.241
Come on, you look good.
You're a good actor.

20:10.276 --> 20:11.742
They probably were gonna
hire you anyway.

20:11.778 --> 20:12.977
Come on, you're sexy.

20:13.012 --> 20:14.512
-They wanted you. What is...?
-Stop it. Stop. Stop it.

20:14.547 --> 20:16.347
I don't want to do this
right now.

20:16.382 --> 20:17.848
Bri, how is it that
I did a good thing,

20:17.884 --> 20:20.251
and now all of a sudden you're
looking at it as a bad thing?

20:20.286 --> 20:22.253
If I look like a chump
because I can't get a job

20:22.288 --> 20:25.056
without my wife helping,
that is a bad thing, Shay.

20:26.793 --> 20:28.392
Bri...

20:30.563 --> 20:32.830
-Can we talk about this, please?
-We're done talking.

20:32.865 --> 20:34.432
I have to go pick up
the girls now.

20:34.467 --> 20:36.634
Just do your thing.

20:41.708 --> 20:45.142
I'm sorry, girls.
Let's just go from the top.

20:47.146 --> 20:50.281
All right.
Five, six, seven, eight.

21:13.389 --> 21:14.922
Well, I'm glad this
is working out, Jay.

21:14.958 --> 21:16.691
I think it's kind of flattering
that the kid's condition

21:16.726 --> 21:18.359
for dropping the complaint
is having you as a guest star

21:18.394 --> 21:21.495
-on his show.
-Yeah, real flattering.

21:21.531 --> 21:23.230
Okay,

21:23.266 --> 21:24.932
just like we rehearsed.

21:26.436 --> 21:28.536
Rolling.

21:28.571 --> 21:30.705
And... action.

21:32.075 --> 21:34.608
Earth is an even sadder planet
if you are the last line

21:34.644 --> 21:36.043
of defense.

21:36.079 --> 21:37.878
My defense is the best offense.

21:42.251 --> 21:44.118
-Whew!
-Cut. Perfect.

21:47.924 --> 21:49.523
And scene.

21:51.294 --> 21:52.727
Hey, Jay, are you okay?

21:52.762 --> 21:54.395
We need a medic over here.

21:54.430 --> 21:55.596
Come on, we're gonna have
to go to the hospital.

21:55.631 --> 21:56.597
Ooh, yeah.

21:56.632 --> 21:58.299
You have to go to the doctor.

21:58.334 --> 22:00.234
As soon as I get the feeling
back in my coconuts.

22:01.504 --> 22:03.804
At least he dropped
the complaint, huh?

22:03.840 --> 22:06.140
Guy's clearly got some issues.
I guess he needed

22:06.175 --> 22:07.842
to work 'em out
through his character, huh?

22:11.180 --> 22:13.581
That's gonna leave a mark.
Oh, yeah.

22:19.322 --> 22:21.322
Yes.

22:28.998 --> 22:30.231
<i>So I've been</i>
<i>thinking about the reboot,</i>

22:30.266 --> 22:32.066
-and if I'm gonna do it...
-Yes!

22:32.101 --> 22:33.968
-I said "if."
-Okay.

22:34.003 --> 22:35.302
I'd want to do things
differently.

22:35.338 --> 22:36.570
All right, well, totally.

22:36.606 --> 22:38.339
I mean, Andrea doesn't
have to be the frumpy nerd

22:38.374 --> 22:39.507
she was back then.

22:39.542 --> 22:40.741
I'm not talking about looks.

22:40.777 --> 22:41.976
You know, Tori,
I'm talking about, like,

22:42.011 --> 22:43.244
inclusion and diversity.

22:43.279 --> 22:45.413
I don't know if you know,
but back in the '90s,

22:45.448 --> 22:46.580
I wasn't even allowed to touch

22:46.616 --> 22:47.848
my African American
TV boyfriend.

22:47.884 --> 22:49.417
I know.
I know things have changed,

22:49.452 --> 22:51.318
but you know what,
they haven't changed enough.

22:51.354 --> 22:53.587
We can do better.
We need to do better.

22:53.623 --> 22:56.290
Okay. So what's happening
with Andrea?

22:56.325 --> 22:59.260
I don't know.
I was thinking maybe...

22:59.295 --> 23:02.763
maybe Andrea could be
exploring her sexuality.

23:02.799 --> 23:03.831
Andrea's gay?

23:03.866 --> 23:05.666
No, she's exploring
her sexuality.

23:05.701 --> 23:06.967
She's figuring it out.

23:07.003 --> 23:10.337
I mean, we could cast queer,
we could do it right.

23:10.373 --> 23:13.374
I couldn't agree more. I think
we should totally do this.

23:13.409 --> 23:14.542
Yeah?

23:14.577 --> 23:16.444
-Oh, Tori, yay.
-Yeah.

23:16.479 --> 23:17.678
-Yay!
-Okay.

23:17.713 --> 23:19.180
-Good idea.
-Good, all right, good.

23:19.215 --> 23:20.848
I'm glad, 'cause that's
what I think will work.

23:25.488 --> 23:26.887
Yeah, so I hired a tech firm.

23:26.923 --> 23:28.122
They set up some cameras
around the house

23:28.157 --> 23:29.290
so I can catch her cheating.

23:29.325 --> 23:31.659
-I needed that for the divorce.
-And you got it?

23:31.694 --> 23:33.627
Oh, I got it.

23:33.663 --> 23:35.696
In the kitchen,
the living room, the bedroom,

23:35.731 --> 23:38.699
my McLaren, which is being
detailed as we speak.

23:38.734 --> 23:40.501
I am so sorry.

23:40.536 --> 23:42.636
If she's gonna betray me
after I was so good to her,

23:42.672 --> 23:44.371
after helping her build a brand

23:44.407 --> 23:46.474
and grow a business,
it's on her. I'm moving on.

23:46.509 --> 23:48.309
Talk to me about this reboot.

23:48.344 --> 23:50.978
Really? Okay.

23:51.013 --> 23:52.813
We need you.

23:52.849 --> 23:55.483
I know. So here's the deal, Tor,

23:55.518 --> 23:58.185
now that I no longer have
to focus on my backstabbing,

23:58.221 --> 24:00.488
cheating wife's businesses,
I can focus on my own.

24:00.523 --> 24:02.556
-Okay, what do you want?
-You.

24:02.592 --> 24:05.259
Our names on a line
of health and beauty products.

24:05.294 --> 24:08.229
Ooh, our faces on the products.

24:08.264 --> 24:09.930
Not our faces, our names.

24:09.966 --> 24:11.899
The product has to be the star.

24:11.934 --> 24:14.235
NexGen by Ian and Tori.

24:14.270 --> 24:15.703
Oh, I don't love that.

24:15.738 --> 24:18.539
-Do you want me to be a
part of this reboot? -Yes.

24:18.574 --> 24:21.709
Fall in love with it.

24:27.817 --> 24:29.283
So, congratulations
on the movie.

24:29.318 --> 24:31.352
We're gonna work
around your schedule.

24:31.387 --> 24:34.555
Yeah, I'm, uh, I'm not doing
the movie anymore.

24:34.590 --> 24:35.556
Why?

24:38.828 --> 24:41.896
They only wanted Shay.
They didn't really want me.

24:41.931 --> 24:43.197
That's why you should do it.

24:43.232 --> 24:44.932
Show them they're wrong.

24:44.967 --> 24:46.400
Yeah, but are they?
I mean, I don't know.

24:46.435 --> 24:47.902
I've been out of the game
for a while.

24:47.937 --> 24:50.538
Maybe I just...
maybe I don't have it anymore.

24:50.573 --> 24:52.540
At least Shay
is trying to help you.

24:52.575 --> 24:55.543
I feel like the only thing Nate
thinks I can produce are babies.

24:55.578 --> 24:57.478
Well, Nate's crazy.

24:57.513 --> 24:59.213
You are a force of nature.

24:59.248 --> 25:02.483
You, you see what you want
and you-you get it.

25:02.518 --> 25:04.251
It's, it's really inspiring.

25:05.621 --> 25:08.222
Well, what I want
right now is you.

25:09.525 --> 25:11.959
In the reboot. What I want...

25:11.994 --> 25:13.260
I want you in the reboot.

25:15.097 --> 25:18.465
Gabby's in. Brian's in.

25:18.501 --> 25:21.235
Oh, we are so close.

25:21.270 --> 25:23.270
I don't know how
to tell you this.

25:27.310 --> 25:29.176
I'm out.

25:29.212 --> 25:30.678
-No.
-Yeah.

25:30.713 --> 25:33.347
Wait, you're bailing on me?
You're not gonna do the reboot?

25:33.382 --> 25:36.917
Kyler filed for emancipation
from me.

25:36.953 --> 25:38.752
My own daughter wants a divorce.

25:38.788 --> 25:40.521
-What?
-Yeah.

25:40.556 --> 25:42.122
I don't want this for her.

25:42.158 --> 25:43.757
I want her to have
a normal life.

25:43.793 --> 25:46.360
I don't want her growing up
in a fishbowl like I did.

25:46.395 --> 25:48.295
-What are you gonna do?
-I don't know!

25:48.331 --> 25:50.364
I don't even know
how to have a normal life.

25:50.399 --> 25:51.532
I'm not equipped for this.

25:51.567 --> 25:54.268
I can't even keep
a marriage together.

25:54.303 --> 25:56.437
I just know that I want her
to finish school.

25:56.472 --> 25:58.105
I want her to have
all those things,

25:58.140 --> 26:00.474
go to prom, date real guys,
not actor guys.

26:00.509 --> 26:02.776
--I don't know how to fix
it, but I have to.

26:02.812 --> 26:06.347
And if that means
staying home with her

26:06.382 --> 26:08.816
and not being on set with you
for 14 hours a day,

26:08.851 --> 26:10.484
then that's what
I'm gonna have to do.

26:10.519 --> 26:12.553
I respect that.

26:12.588 --> 26:15.389
You do?
Wait, what, you're not mad?

26:15.424 --> 26:19.360
Oh, I am furious,

26:19.395 --> 26:21.562
but only because I can't imagine

26:21.597 --> 26:23.030
doing this without you.

26:23.065 --> 26:25.065
You are gonna be great.
Look what you've already done.

26:26.335 --> 26:27.868
Now stop doubting yourself.

26:29.071 --> 26:32.906
While you're at it,
stop playing with dolls.

26:35.011 --> 26:37.544
So you came to L.A. and you
didn't even bother visiting me.

26:37.580 --> 26:39.847
- That's insulting.
<i>- I know.</i>

26:39.882 --> 26:41.415
<i>I'm so sorry, but duty calls.</i>

26:41.450 --> 26:43.817
Well, I need my secret
best friend.

26:43.853 --> 26:45.886
-Thank you for picking up.
<i>-Aw.</i>

26:45.921 --> 26:47.154
You know that I love you, Bri.

26:47.189 --> 26:49.390
What's going on? Talk to me.

26:49.425 --> 26:50.858
Same thing I-I left
on your voice mail.

26:50.893 --> 26:51.859
<i>It's the Shay thing?</i>

26:51.894 --> 26:54.895
<i>-Yeah.</i>
-Hi.

26:54.930 --> 26:55.829
Hey!

26:55.865 --> 26:57.831
<i>Stop! Okay, so</i>

26:57.867 --> 27:00.601
you want my advice? Here it is.
You got to let it go.

27:00.636 --> 27:03.003
I can't let it go.
She deceived me.

27:03.039 --> 27:05.272
No, she did not.
She was just trying to help you.

27:05.308 --> 27:08.275
This is not a reflection
on her lack of faith in you.

27:08.311 --> 27:09.543
That's your own
insecurity talking.

27:09.578 --> 27:10.878
<i>You know what's annoying?</i>

27:10.913 --> 27:12.780
The fact that you know me
as well as you do.

27:12.815 --> 27:14.281
<i>Let me give you</i>
<i>an analogy real quick.</i>

27:14.317 --> 27:17.251
I use decoys

27:17.286 --> 27:19.586
<i>to attract mates</i>
<i>for my rescues.</i>

27:19.622 --> 27:21.655
-Now, is that deceptive?
<i>-Yes.</i>

27:21.691 --> 27:24.692
Yes, it is, but is it also
for the greater good?

27:24.727 --> 27:27.695
- Yes, it is.
<i>- Endangered birds</i>

27:27.730 --> 27:30.664
deserve to continue
their species,

27:30.700 --> 27:33.167
just like you deserve
to continue your career.

27:33.202 --> 27:35.402
Thank you for your wisdom.

27:35.438 --> 27:38.272
<i>-Oh, Tori's trying to reach you.</i>
-Me?

27:38.307 --> 27:39.840
<i>I don't have time</i>
<i>for that right now.</i>

27:39.875 --> 27:41.709
<i>Baby, I have got to go</i>
<i>because I've got</i>

27:41.744 --> 27:44.511
this sea lion who's not exactly
cooperating right now,

27:44.547 --> 27:46.347
and he's got all these
gill nets around.

27:46.382 --> 27:49.616
-May the Force be with you.
<i>-All right. Bye.</i>

27:49.652 --> 27:51.652
Good job. Go.

27:57.693 --> 27:58.759
What are you doing here?

27:58.794 --> 28:00.427
How do you know where I live?

28:00.463 --> 28:03.630
-Star maps.
-What do you want?

28:04.700 --> 28:06.767
Tori said
you're not doing the reboot.

28:06.802 --> 28:10.237
I just came over to say
I hope it's not because of me.

28:10.272 --> 28:13.140
You're not that important,
Jason.

28:13.175 --> 28:16.777
You are very mean to me.

28:19.081 --> 28:22.750
Okay, it's...
because of my daughter.

28:22.785 --> 28:25.719
She okay?

28:25.755 --> 28:27.454
No, she wants to be an actor.

28:27.490 --> 28:29.156
Oh, no.

28:29.191 --> 28:31.925
Exactly, yeah.
I got to put an end to that.

28:31.961 --> 28:33.560
Well, if she's anything
like we were at that age,

28:33.596 --> 28:35.929
she's gonna find a way to do it,
whether you're on board or not.

28:35.965 --> 28:37.965
Okay, that's very reassuring.
Thank you.

28:38.000 --> 28:39.633
Oh, I'm just saying,

28:39.668 --> 28:41.668
do you want her
to think of you as someone

28:41.704 --> 28:45.172
who supported her dreams
or someone who stood in her way?

28:45.207 --> 28:47.508
I want her not to repeat
my mistakes.

28:47.543 --> 28:49.676
-She won't.
-You don't know that.

28:49.712 --> 28:50.911
-Sure, I do.
-How?

28:50.946 --> 28:53.280
'Cause she's got you
for a mother.

29:06.629 --> 29:08.362
Hey.

29:10.065 --> 29:11.365
I'm in.

29:11.400 --> 29:13.434
Really? Jen...

29:13.469 --> 29:15.936
On one condition.
Kyler gets to be on the show.

29:15.971 --> 29:18.705
If she wants to act,
I'm gonna have it be by my side.

29:18.741 --> 29:20.841
Keep her from doing
all the stupid stuff we did.

29:20.876 --> 29:22.509
Yes, I think it's a great idea!

29:22.545 --> 29:25.512
Actually,
Jason deserves the credit.

29:25.548 --> 29:26.947
Jason?

29:26.982 --> 29:29.883
Jason Priestley?
Since when do you talk to him?

29:31.754 --> 29:33.887
-Are we gonna work or what?
-Go.

29:35.925 --> 29:37.524
I was thinking,
you're such a neat freak,

29:37.560 --> 29:39.059
you might actually
get off on this.

29:39.094 --> 29:40.961
Hmm, if only you would fit
in one of these bags.

29:40.996 --> 29:42.496
Oh, look,

29:42.531 --> 29:45.833
a hypodermic needle
in a public park. How sweet.

29:45.868 --> 29:47.868
Let me get that for you.

29:47.903 --> 29:49.470
-Thank you.
-Don't mention it.

29:49.505 --> 29:50.904
Oh, great, now we're
thanking each other

29:50.940 --> 29:52.239
for picking up
hypodermic needles.

29:52.274 --> 29:55.542
Yeah, I was thanking you
for the parenting advice.

29:55.578 --> 29:58.011
It was surprisingly useful.

29:58.047 --> 29:59.646
Well, I'm glad,

29:59.682 --> 30:03.150
because I'm gonna ask you
to return the favor soon.

30:03.185 --> 30:06.220
Camille's pregnant.

30:06.255 --> 30:08.255
Seriously?

30:09.725 --> 30:11.024
Wow.

30:11.060 --> 30:13.694
-"Wow"?
-Uh...

30:13.729 --> 30:17.364
I'm sorry. I mean, congrats.

30:17.399 --> 30:19.733
Yeah, I didn't find out
till after Vegas.

30:19.768 --> 30:21.201
Guys.

30:21.237 --> 30:24.438
I just, uh, want to take this
opportunity and say thank you.

30:24.473 --> 30:26.440
I know it hasn't been easy...

30:26.475 --> 30:27.908
No, actually,
it's been disgusting.

30:27.943 --> 30:30.410
Oh, is that a turkey carcass?

30:30.446 --> 30:31.712
Yeah, I'm sure it is, Brian.

30:31.747 --> 30:34.248
Griffith Park is overrun
with wild turkeys.

30:34.283 --> 30:35.883
We're the turkeys
for wearing these jumpsuits.

30:35.918 --> 30:39.186
You know what? This punishment
does not fit the crime.

30:39.221 --> 30:42.122
Okay. Fine.
Hate me for Vegas.

30:42.157 --> 30:43.357
But come on, you guys.

30:43.392 --> 30:45.559
Aren't you a little excited
to do the reboot?

30:45.594 --> 30:47.895
<i>I</i> am.
I'm so happy everyone signed on.

30:47.930 --> 30:51.031
- I like to consider myself loosely
attached. - Okay. That's fine.

30:51.066 --> 30:52.799
But I do think we should
all talk before we go to Fox.

30:52.835 --> 30:55.135
We really need
an updated version.

30:55.170 --> 30:57.204
<i>-90210</i> needs a face-lift.
-I know <i> I</i> need a face-lift.

30:57.239 --> 30:59.206
Like, Gab and I were talking.

30:59.241 --> 31:02.042
Maybe Andrea could be
exploring her sexuality.

31:02.077 --> 31:04.211
What, are you guys, like,
you're talking story already?

31:04.246 --> 31:06.647
Uh... no, it-it's
not what I meant.

31:06.682 --> 31:08.982
- Al-Although we did hire a writer.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

31:09.018 --> 31:10.951
Don't you think <i> I</i> should
sit down with this writer?

31:10.986 --> 31:12.920
I mean, I am the director.

31:12.955 --> 31:15.589
What do you mean, the director?
What... who made <i> that</i> decision?

31:15.624 --> 31:19.393
Me. I...<i> I</i> made that decision.

31:19.428 --> 31:22.396
- Because I'm the producer.
- Okay, Ms. Producer,

31:22.431 --> 31:24.498
if people have demands,
I have one, too.

31:24.533 --> 31:26.066
I need a brand relaunch.

31:26.101 --> 31:29.102
Natural integration of my solo
entrepreneurial efforts.

31:30.205 --> 31:31.638
Okay, are you speaking English?

31:31.674 --> 31:32.773
Product placement.

31:32.808 --> 31:34.408
Whoa, whoa, hold on.

31:34.443 --> 31:37.578
I'm not letting you turn <i> my</i> show
into a commercial.

31:37.613 --> 31:40.013
Excuse me.
What are you talking about

31:40.049 --> 31:41.915
<i>your</i> show for?
Since when did this become

31:41.951 --> 31:45.452
-your show? -When did any of
this become your commercial?

31:45.487 --> 31:46.653
Okay, so, is that the way
it's gonna be?

31:46.689 --> 31:47.754
'Cause if it is, then I'm out.

31:47.790 --> 31:49.256
Wait a minute.
How can you be out?

31:49.291 --> 31:50.924
- 'Cause I'm out.
- This is not your show.

31:50.960 --> 31:52.926
You were never <i> in</i>
in the first place.

31:52.962 --> 31:54.761
-Guys, guys, listen, guys. -You've
got to be in before you can get out.

31:54.797 --> 31:56.930
Stop! Stop!

31:56.966 --> 31:58.098
You guys.

31:58.133 --> 32:02.536
Listen. We all agreed
to do this for a reason.

32:02.571 --> 32:03.937
If there's something
that's important

32:03.973 --> 32:05.872
to you, you can have it. Jen,

32:05.908 --> 32:07.941
- she wants her daughter cast in the show.
- What?

32:07.977 --> 32:10.110
Nepotism, Jen?
Didn't you learn enough lessons

32:10.145 --> 32:11.545
from Tori being
on her dad's show?

32:11.580 --> 32:13.447
I'm right here.
Jay's directing.

32:13.482 --> 32:15.616
-Gab's bi.
-Andrea's bi.

32:15.651 --> 32:17.951
Z? You want product placement?
It's all yours.

32:17.987 --> 32:20.120
- Bri, what do you want? Anything.
- If we did this show

32:20.155 --> 32:23.223
for ten years, and we'll
possibly do it for <i> another</i> ten,

32:23.258 --> 32:24.458
we should all be equal partners.

32:24.493 --> 32:26.627
-Creatively. Everything.
-Agreed.

32:26.662 --> 32:27.961
We're all a team.

32:27.997 --> 32:29.963
But do you know what, you guys?

32:29.999 --> 32:32.633
If you guys all get something,
I want something, too.

32:32.668 --> 32:34.034
Oh, boy, here it comes.

32:39.942 --> 32:42.476
- Group therapy.
- What's that?

32:42.511 --> 32:44.578
- Just say it now.
- Group therapy?

32:44.613 --> 32:46.680
-Group therapy?
Are you kidding me? -No...

32:46.715 --> 32:48.248
-N-N-Not me, I'm not...
-I don't need that.

32:48.283 --> 32:49.549
If there's anything...
hey-hey-hey-hey.

32:49.585 --> 32:51.251
If there's anything this group
needs, it's...

32:51.286 --> 32:52.352
- Medication.
- Therapy.

32:52.388 --> 32:54.021
- We do need medication.
- Oh, my God.

32:54.056 --> 32:55.322
How much can one person have?

32:55.357 --> 32:56.490
It's a nonnegotiable, guys.

32:56.525 --> 32:58.425
What do you mean
it's a non-negotiable?

32:58.460 --> 33:00.160
-That's not true.
-It's a non-nego... you... look at us!

33:01.196 --> 33:02.362
Here we go.
Come on, guys.

33:02.398 --> 33:03.530
Oh, it's a...
it's a photo shoot now?

33:03.565 --> 33:05.599
-Hey.
-Here we are.

33:12.741 --> 33:16.009
Hey, guys, game time.

33:16.045 --> 33:17.511
-Nice to see you.
-Good to see you. -How are you?

33:17.546 --> 33:18.845
-Good to see you. -Hi. -Hi.

33:18.881 --> 33:19.946
-Very nice to see you.
-Good to see you.

33:19.982 --> 33:21.181
-Hi.
-Hi. Thank you.

33:21.216 --> 33:23.050
- Hi.
- Shannen's delayed

33:23.085 --> 33:25.252
-in Africa.
-Well, this is a real thrill.

33:25.287 --> 33:27.954
Seeing the whole gang
back together again.

33:27.990 --> 33:29.423
Well, it's a thrill
for all of us, too.

33:29.458 --> 33:31.725
Uh, as a token of our
appreciation, we brought you

33:31.760 --> 33:33.393
- a little gift.
- Thank you.

33:33.429 --> 33:34.695
That is amazing.

33:34.730 --> 33:37.130
Before we get started,
we would like to introduce you

33:37.166 --> 33:39.366
to a new executive who will be
running the show day-to-day.

33:39.401 --> 33:40.967
In fact, you all know her.

33:41.003 --> 33:43.236
I'm sure you all remember?

33:46.075 --> 33:47.474
Holy Emily Valentine.

33:47.509 --> 33:49.543
I definitely remember <i> you.</i>

33:51.246 --> 33:53.413
Maybe therapy wasn't a bad idea.

33:53.449 --> 33:55.315
So hello, everyone.

33:55.350 --> 33:57.551
It's so great to see all of you.

33:57.586 --> 34:01.154
And thank you so much
for showering after that whole

34:01.190 --> 34:02.889
garbage pickup thing.

34:02.925 --> 34:05.625
And the pictures at TMZ,
awesome.

34:05.661 --> 34:07.160
Way to rock that vest, Tori.

34:07.196 --> 34:08.228
Oh, thanks.

34:08.263 --> 34:10.230
And I think therapy
is a great idea.

34:10.264 --> 34:12.099
I think each and every one
of you should explore

34:12.134 --> 34:14.400
your narcissism, your neuroses,

34:14.436 --> 34:16.402
your pathological
self-absorption.

34:16.438 --> 34:20.005
Embrace it. It's gonna
make great television.

34:20.042 --> 34:22.743
Um... thank you?

34:22.777 --> 34:26.612
This is gonna be
so... much... fun.

34:31.920 --> 34:33.286
<i>What do you want</i>
<i>to talk about, Mom?</i>

34:33.322 --> 34:34.920
When you said you wanted
to get into acting,

34:34.956 --> 34:37.224
I couldn't really separate
my experience

34:37.259 --> 34:39.993
from what yours could be.

34:40.027 --> 34:42.728
-I got scared.
-Of what?

34:42.764 --> 34:44.630
Of how it could affect you.

34:44.666 --> 34:48.601
Now and 20 years from now.

34:48.637 --> 34:51.605
Look, I know you think
you're ready for this,

34:51.639 --> 34:53.072
but the reason
for that is because

34:53.108 --> 34:54.940
you have no idea
what you're getting into.

34:54.976 --> 34:56.009
-Well, Mom, I...
-And the reason

34:56.043 --> 34:59.279
for that is because
I shielded you.

35:00.315 --> 35:01.915
I don't want to be the person

35:01.950 --> 35:04.785
that stands in the way
of your dreams.

35:07.289 --> 35:10.457
Are these
the emancipation papers?

35:10.492 --> 35:12.292
Mm, no.
I shredded those.

35:12.327 --> 35:15.428
This is a contract
for a recurring role

35:15.464 --> 35:18.698
-on the <i> 90210</i> reboot.
-What? Really?

35:18.734 --> 35:19.966
-Mm.
-But... I thought you said...

35:20.002 --> 35:21.268
If I'm going to protect you,

35:21.303 --> 35:23.470
I've got to prepare you,
so that means I'm gonna tell you

35:23.505 --> 35:24.971
all about how it was for me.

35:25.007 --> 35:27.641
Every last gory detail.

35:27.676 --> 35:30.277
And if, after that,
you still want to do this,

35:30.312 --> 35:33.947
then we'll sign the papers.
We'll do it together.

35:33.982 --> 35:36.449
Deal.

35:36.485 --> 35:38.451
So this talk, how long you
thinking, like, 15 minutes?

35:38.487 --> 35:39.452
Couple hours?

35:39.488 --> 35:42.956
-Could be days.
-Okay.

35:42.991 --> 35:44.791
So buckle up, baby.

35:44.827 --> 35:46.960
<i>Here's to 30 years.</i>

35:46.995 --> 35:48.228
-Mm.
-30 years?

35:48.263 --> 35:49.563
Are we that old?

35:49.598 --> 35:51.965
Not me, just you.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.366
Here's to Friday date nights.

35:53.402 --> 35:56.837
Every one better than the last.

35:56.872 --> 36:00.674
-Mm.
-What's the matter?

36:00.709 --> 36:02.242
Oh... this.

36:03.278 --> 36:05.412
You know me so well.

36:05.447 --> 36:07.848
This is exactly what I needed.

36:07.883 --> 36:08.982
I would be...

36:09.017 --> 36:11.084
I'd be so lost without you.

36:11.119 --> 36:14.087
Well, then, it's a good thing
I'm not going anywhere.

36:15.691 --> 36:18.658
I want to tell you something.

36:18.694 --> 36:21.294
-It's about the reboot.
-Mm.

36:22.431 --> 36:24.397
I've decided to do it.

36:24.433 --> 36:25.932
Really?

36:25.968 --> 36:28.001
Part of my agreeing to do it

36:28.036 --> 36:32.305
is having Andrea
explore her sexuality.

36:34.276 --> 36:36.610
It's an important story
for me to tell.

36:36.645 --> 36:38.845
I think that's great.
It's high time.

36:38.881 --> 36:39.946
Good for you.

36:41.049 --> 36:43.083
I want to tell you why

36:43.118 --> 36:45.819
it is so important to me.

36:53.095 --> 36:57.030
Okay, I stalked you, but
I couldn't wait to talk to you.

36:57.065 --> 37:00.133
Listen... you were right.

37:00.168 --> 37:03.737
I am so sorry about overstepping
with your audition.

37:05.407 --> 37:07.641
Please don't be mad at me.

37:07.676 --> 37:10.377
I'm not mad at you.

37:10.412 --> 37:12.212
I've been, I've been
thinking about it,

37:12.247 --> 37:14.247
and, uh, you were just
trying to help.

37:14.283 --> 37:15.715
-I'm sorry.
-I was,

37:15.751 --> 37:17.951
but I'm gonna stay in my lane
from now on.

37:17.986 --> 37:20.820
-You got a lot going on.
-Yeah.

37:20.856 --> 37:22.822
So, are you excited
for the reboot?

37:22.858 --> 37:26.226
Yeah. Yeah. I-I mean
it's gonna be a, a big change,

37:26.261 --> 37:28.461
you know, I'm not,
not gonna be around as much

37:28.497 --> 37:29.896
as I'm used to.

37:29.932 --> 37:31.998
Might have to hire
my own assistant.

37:32.034 --> 37:33.934
As long as you don't try
to take one of mine.

37:33.969 --> 37:35.902
--Never.
I wouldn't even think about

37:35.938 --> 37:37.404
poaching one of your assistants.

37:37.439 --> 37:39.839
Call my agent
and have him hook me up.

37:39.875 --> 37:41.408
I'm sorry.

37:41.443 --> 37:44.110
-I love you.
-I love you.

37:57.993 --> 37:59.859
It's really coming together.

37:59.895 --> 38:01.494
We got the cast on board.

38:01.530 --> 38:03.129
Jason's meeting
with the writer tomorrow.

38:03.165 --> 38:04.965
The network's excited.

38:05.000 --> 38:08.868
And... I know you think
I can't do this, but...

38:10.372 --> 38:12.372
I actually know I can.

38:13.308 --> 38:15.442
And it has n...

38:15.477 --> 38:17.978
It has nothing to do
with the money.

38:18.013 --> 38:20.246
It's because I'm passionate
about it.

38:23.685 --> 38:25.485
And I'd just...

38:25.520 --> 38:28.154
I'd really like you
to support me on this.

38:28.190 --> 38:30.323
And I know it's not
gonna be easy.

38:31.526 --> 38:32.826
Babe?

38:35.430 --> 38:37.397
<i>Really, Tori?</i>

38:37.432 --> 38:39.666
How much food can one woman
possibly eat?

38:44.172 --> 38:46.806
Hey, Doc.
What's the good news?

38:46.842 --> 38:50.710
<i>-Well, your set injury caused no permanent
damage.</i> -Yeah, that is good news.

38:50.746 --> 38:54.581
<i>-But I did discover a preexisting
fertility issue.</i> -What?

38:54.616 --> 38:57.050
<i>Yeah, conceiving children</i>
<i>is possible,</i>

38:57.085 --> 39:00.020
<i>but it will require significant</i>
<i>medical intervention.</i>

39:00.055 --> 39:02.522
Fertility issue?
What are you talking about?

39:02.557 --> 39:04.190
-Jason.
-What?

39:04.226 --> 39:06.860
Jack Carlisle.
Great to meet you.

39:06.895 --> 39:08.061
I can't explain how excited I am

39:08.096 --> 39:09.496
to be writing the pilot
for the reboot.

39:09.531 --> 39:11.731
-What's that now?
-The reboot.

39:11.767 --> 39:13.199
A friend of mine
reached out to the network,

39:13.235 --> 39:15.168
who put me in touch
with Tori Spelling.

39:15.203 --> 39:16.503
I'm the new writer.

39:16.538 --> 39:20.206
Oh.
Uh, take a seat.

39:20.242 --> 39:22.008
Doc, I'm gonna have
to call you back.

39:22.044 --> 39:24.511
-You want a drink?
-Yeah, I'd love one.
