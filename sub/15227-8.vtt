01:16.308 --> 01:18.910
Oh, boy.

01:18.978 --> 01:23.181
Nothing like seeing <i>E.T.</i>
        for the 64th time

01:23.248 --> 01:26.084
to pick up your day.

01:26.152 --> 01:29.254
Oh, Jim, aren't you sick
       of that movie yet?

01:29.321 --> 01:31.423
Does this look
like I'm sick of it?

01:31.490 --> 01:33.024
(grunts)

01:33.092 --> 01:34.559
I bet you've seen that movie
           more times

01:34.626 --> 01:35.826
than anybody else in the city.

01:35.894 --> 01:36.928
No.

01:36.996 --> 01:40.264
Actually, there's this kid--

01:40.332 --> 01:44.536
fat kid, wears glasses,
         13 years old--

01:44.603 --> 01:47.839
who's just seen it
              for the 74th time.

01:47.907 --> 01:49.540
I love that movie, too...

01:49.608 --> 01:52.110
What was your
                favorite part?

01:52.178 --> 01:54.979
Uh... I guess
      when he was watching

01:55.047 --> 01:57.248
the mother read <i>Peter Pan</i>
     to the kids, you know?

01:57.316 --> 01:58.250
Oh, yes.

01:59.351 --> 02:01.453
Touching.

02:01.520 --> 02:02.553
Magical.

02:02.621 --> 02:03.922
Hey, hey, that was good,

02:03.989 --> 02:05.823
but what about when he made
       the bicycles fly?

02:05.891 --> 02:06.824
(Elaine and Jim gasp)

02:06.892 --> 02:09.827
I loved that.
       Brilliant, moving.

02:09.895 --> 02:13.197
This is making me want
      to go see it again.

02:14.266 --> 02:17.001
What was
   your favorite part, Alex?

02:17.069 --> 02:18.102
I haven't seen it.

02:19.204 --> 02:22.174
Why the hell not?

02:22.241 --> 02:25.343
Because I-I just don't, uh...
     I just haven't, uh...

02:25.411 --> 02:28.880
I-I admit the lines were
     pretty long at first,

02:28.947 --> 02:30.247
but that doesn't cut it anymore.

02:30.315 --> 02:33.651
I haven't seen it because
        I don't happen to, uh...

02:33.718 --> 02:34.652
Why?

02:34.720 --> 02:37.055
Why? Why, why, why?

02:37.123 --> 02:40.558
Because I don't like science
   fiction movies, all right?

02:40.626 --> 02:43.160
(incredulous gasp)

02:43.228 --> 02:45.997
All right, then.

02:46.065 --> 02:47.598
Here's five bucks.

02:47.666 --> 02:48.733
What?

02:48.800 --> 02:50.201
Mr. Smug.
                    What are you
                  talking about?

02:50.269 --> 02:52.303
Go see <i>E.T.</i>

02:52.370 --> 02:53.605
Oh, come on, Jim.

02:53.672 --> 02:55.674
Do me and your soul a favor.

02:55.741 --> 02:57.409
Jim, I don't want--

02:57.476 --> 02:59.244
I don't want the money, please.

02:59.311 --> 03:02.313
If you go see the movie
and you don't like it,

03:02.381 --> 03:04.683
then I'll take
your money back.

03:06.786 --> 03:09.888
And by the way, don't sit

03:09.955 --> 03:13.858
next to a little fat kid
         with glasses.

03:13.926 --> 03:16.227
He flicks Milk Duds at people

03:16.295 --> 03:19.531
who say the dialogue
     along with the movie.

03:20.799 --> 03:22.199
(Milk Dud clacks into can)

03:22.267 --> 03:24.202
(phone rings)

03:25.304 --> 03:27.772
Sunshine Cab.

03:29.108 --> 03:31.042
Who do you want?

03:31.110 --> 03:32.377
Who?

03:32.445 --> 03:34.779
W-Whoa, whoa, whoa, lady, lady,
    I can't understand you.

03:34.847 --> 03:37.348
You're slurring your speech.

03:37.416 --> 03:40.285
Uh, Lilewoowi?

03:40.353 --> 03:43.722
Lilewoowi De Palma?

03:43.789 --> 03:45.723
This is him.

03:45.791 --> 03:48.259
Who's this?

03:48.326 --> 03:49.427
What do you want?

03:50.529 --> 03:52.831
Uh...

03:52.898 --> 03:55.333
where are you?

03:55.401 --> 03:56.668
Oh, yeah?

03:56.736 --> 03:58.302
Well, no, I-I-I don't know,
         I don't know.

03:58.370 --> 04:00.538
I-I-I...

04:00.606 --> 04:02.073
Yeah.

04:02.141 --> 04:03.274
Okay.

04:03.342 --> 04:05.076
Goodbye.

04:05.143 --> 04:09.080
Now, who was that, Lilewoowi?

04:12.651 --> 04:17.021
It was a voice
      from the past, Iggy.

04:17.089 --> 04:18.689
A woman.

04:18.757 --> 04:23.394
A seductress who possessed class

04:23.461 --> 04:26.731
and charm and sophistication

04:26.799 --> 04:31.102
that made her seem
        beyond my grasp.

04:31.169 --> 04:32.903
You mean that prison guard?

04:35.007 --> 04:37.609
You love bringing that up,
       don't you, Reiger?

04:37.676 --> 04:39.444
No, not the prison guard.

04:39.511 --> 04:41.446
Emily.

04:42.547 --> 04:44.949
Oh, Emily.

04:45.017 --> 04:45.950
Emily.

04:46.017 --> 04:47.618
Who's that?

04:47.686 --> 04:51.856
She's a beautiful photographer

04:51.924 --> 04:56.060
who I once took a crazy trip
       to the stars with.

04:56.128 --> 04:58.929
Excuse me, for those of you
    interested in accuracy,

04:58.997 --> 05:01.666
I'm going to do a simultaneous
    translation on this one.

05:02.968 --> 05:06.170
She had an unusual quality
    that I love in a woman.

05:06.238 --> 05:07.639
She managed
to stomach him.

05:10.375 --> 05:12.644
She fell in love
       with me like that.

05:12.711 --> 05:13.978
She was tanked up
          on pills and booze.

05:14.046 --> 05:16.247
Somebody just dumped her.

05:16.315 --> 05:21.218
But our love, even like
   the most beautiful flower,

05:21.286 --> 05:23.554
wilted and fell.

05:23.622 --> 05:26.024
She sobered up.

05:26.092 --> 05:29.794
Reiger, it was painful.

05:29.862 --> 05:34.766
When she came to, she thought
  I was gross and disgusting.

05:34.833 --> 05:36.801
She said it out loud.

05:36.869 --> 05:39.603
Nobody has ever said that
        out loud before.

05:39.671 --> 05:41.438
Didn't you say that today?
      I say it every day.

05:41.506 --> 05:44.809
ALEX:
                     Who hasn't?

05:44.877 --> 05:46.044
Poor Emily.

05:46.111 --> 05:48.580
What do, what do you mean,
poor Emily?

05:48.647 --> 05:51.081
Well, it's so sad that she
         mixed drugs and alcohol

05:51.149 --> 05:52.750
and ended up spending
              the night with you

05:52.817 --> 05:56.520
when most people
                       only die.

06:01.293 --> 06:02.226
Why do I try?

06:02.294 --> 06:03.294
(laughs)

06:03.362 --> 06:05.530
Hey, Lou, what'd
                 she call about?

06:05.597 --> 06:07.932
Well, the same guy
       dumped her again,

06:07.999 --> 06:10.869
and now she's in a bar,
      crocked off her nut,

06:10.936 --> 06:13.971
and she wants to see me.

06:14.039 --> 06:15.606
What are you going to do?
        You going to go?

06:15.674 --> 06:19.544
It's the only score in my life
       I haven't settled.

06:19.611 --> 06:22.112
For a year,
I've wanted to do this.

06:22.180 --> 06:25.116
When she called me
     gross and disgusting,

06:25.184 --> 06:26.717
I had a drink in my hand.

06:26.785 --> 06:30.621
I always regretted that I didn't
     throw it in her face.

06:30.689 --> 06:32.757
She's in a bar now.

06:32.825 --> 06:36.961
I'm going to go down there
and sluice down that little tart

06:37.029 --> 06:40.431
until there's eye makeup
   running out of her shoes.

06:41.533 --> 06:45.470
(piano playing)

06:51.577 --> 06:55.246
(light applause)

06:55.314 --> 06:57.615
(piano begins
playing another melody)

06:57.682 --> 06:59.250
Hello there.

06:59.318 --> 07:01.652
Hey.

07:01.720 --> 07:02.854
Uh...

07:02.922 --> 07:07.391
I-I'm supposed to meet,
uh, a young woman here.

07:07.459 --> 07:11.462
Uh, dark hair,
uh, attractive?

07:12.931 --> 07:15.500
Heavily sedated,
possibly suicidal?

07:16.568 --> 07:17.702
Oh, you mean Emily.

07:17.770 --> 07:19.003
Yeah, yeah.

07:19.071 --> 07:21.172
She's here. Uh...

07:21.240 --> 07:22.740
She's probably in
               the ladies' room.

07:22.808 --> 07:23.741
Ah.

07:23.808 --> 07:24.976
You want a drink?

07:25.044 --> 07:27.845
Yeah, yeah, uh, uh,
let me have something, uh,

07:27.913 --> 07:31.148
tall, cold, and sticky--

07:31.216 --> 07:32.950
something that would be
impossible

07:33.017 --> 07:34.519
to wash
out of your hair.

07:34.587 --> 07:36.020
What?

07:36.088 --> 07:38.323
Man says there's a bug
        in his mai tai.

07:38.390 --> 07:40.024
Oh, I'll take it,
I'll take it.

07:40.092 --> 07:42.026
No charge, right?
                          Right.

07:44.129 --> 07:46.797
Psst.

08:08.287 --> 08:11.789
Hello, Emily, you
             little pill popper.

08:11.856 --> 08:13.157
Louie?

08:13.225 --> 08:14.859
Oh, Louie.

08:14.927 --> 08:18.763
Oh, Louie,
Louie, Louie.

08:18.831 --> 08:22.166
Oh, thank God
you came.

08:22.234 --> 08:23.434
Oh, I wouldn't have
blamed you

08:23.502 --> 08:25.636
if you'd just hung up
on me when I called.

08:25.704 --> 08:27.304
I would have
deserved it.

08:27.372 --> 08:29.473
Actually, anything
that you would have done to me

08:29.541 --> 08:31.208
I would have deserved.

08:31.276 --> 08:32.208
Hold that thought.

08:32.277 --> 08:34.845
Oh, Louie.

08:34.913 --> 08:37.582
Louie,
I'm so sorry, Louie.

08:37.649 --> 08:41.552
I had no one else to turn to
and you came.

08:41.620 --> 08:46.157
You are the most wonderful,
the most remarkable man that,

08:46.224 --> 08:47.792
that I've ever known.

08:47.859 --> 08:49.259
Oh...

08:49.327 --> 08:50.628
(sobbing)

08:50.696 --> 08:52.630
Oh...

08:53.966 --> 08:58.936
Hey, Mac, you got a bar rag
    back there or something?

09:00.005 --> 09:00.971
Yes.

09:01.039 --> 09:03.207
I'm sorry, Louie, I...

09:03.275 --> 09:05.944
Here, here,
               blow, blow, blow.

09:06.011 --> 09:08.779
(grunting)

09:08.847 --> 09:11.215
Louie?
               Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:13.285 --> 09:14.252
Now, Louie...
                     What, what?

09:14.319 --> 09:15.385
Louie, couldn't we,

09:15.453 --> 09:17.454
c-couldn't we go back
to your place, Louie?

09:17.522 --> 09:18.456
Could...

09:18.524 --> 09:20.958
No chance,
                Sundance, uh-uh.

09:21.025 --> 09:24.128
Well, why?

09:24.196 --> 09:26.831
Because it's not you talking,
           it's your pharmacist.

09:26.898 --> 09:29.567
You think
that the pills

09:29.635 --> 09:32.269
that I take govern
my actions?

09:32.337 --> 09:35.572
Emily, your purse should
          have a childproof cap.

09:35.640 --> 09:37.307
(chuckles)

09:37.375 --> 09:38.375
You know something,
Louie?

09:38.443 --> 09:39.643
Do you know
you're delightful?

09:39.711 --> 09:40.778
Yeah, yeah,
                   yeah, yeah...

09:40.846 --> 09:42.814
Oh, great, I'll add
                 it to the list.

09:42.881 --> 09:45.282
Gross, disgusting,
                     delightful.

09:46.352 --> 09:47.284
Right.
       Louie...

09:47.352 --> 09:48.286
Yeah, yeah,
                   yeah, yeah...

09:48.353 --> 09:49.620
Louie, Louie, Louie.

09:49.688 --> 09:51.255
Eh...
         Oh.

09:54.759 --> 09:58.095
Aw...

09:58.163 --> 09:59.497
No, n-no, no,
                    Emily, look.

09:59.565 --> 10:04.468
No, look, I feel great
      that I'm turning you down.

10:04.536 --> 10:07.138
I feel great that I'm
             walking out on you.

10:07.205 --> 10:08.972
Too bad, baby.

10:09.040 --> 10:13.477
I'm too smart to fall
        for your song and dance.

10:16.215 --> 10:19.283
¶ It had to be you

10:21.186 --> 10:25.790
¶ It had to be you

10:25.857 --> 10:30.728
¶ I wandered around,
        finally found ¶

10:30.796 --> 10:35.666
¶ The somebody who

10:36.735 --> 10:40.704
¶ Could make me be true

10:40.772 --> 10:45.276
¶ Could make me
be blue ¶

10:45.344 --> 10:48.145
¶ Could make me feel glad

10:48.212 --> 10:50.714
¶ Just to be sad

10:50.782 --> 10:54.986
¶ Thinking of you

10:55.053 --> 10:58.656
¶ Nobody else

10:58.724 --> 11:01.124
¶ Gave me a thrill...

11:04.963 --> 11:07.465
¶ With all your faults

11:07.532 --> 11:10.601
¶ I love you still

11:12.671 --> 11:16.173
¶ It had to be me

11:16.241 --> 11:19.643
¶ Wonderful you

11:19.711 --> 11:22.079
¶ It had to be...

11:23.182 --> 11:25.816
¶ Me.

11:38.097 --> 11:40.430
(light jazz melody
       playing on piano)

12:06.524 --> 12:08.459
(melody swells)

12:27.512 --> 12:29.079
(camera shutter clicks)

12:35.988 --> 12:38.021
(screams)

12:41.226 --> 12:43.794
What are you doing here?

12:43.861 --> 12:45.662
Come on, come on,
     what happened to, uh,

12:45.730 --> 12:47.932
"It had to be you,
      I gave you a thrill,

12:47.999 --> 12:50.301
and nobody's
                 as good as me"?

12:50.368 --> 12:52.270
No, Emily, you
               can't, you can't.

12:52.337 --> 12:53.403
You can't do this.

12:53.471 --> 12:55.339
You can't throw me out.

12:55.407 --> 12:57.975
I really need
     to be alone right now.

12:58.043 --> 13:00.611
No, no, Emily, Emily,
      don't do this to yourself.

13:00.678 --> 13:04.648
You are crazy if you let me
      slip through your fingers.

13:05.783 --> 13:08.485
You've had the handsome guys.

13:08.553 --> 13:11.188
You've had, uh,
                  the rich guys.

13:11.256 --> 13:13.457
You've had the
                    smooth guys.

13:13.525 --> 13:17.027
You've had the,
                 uh, sharp guys;

13:17.095 --> 13:19.463
the, uh, smart guys;

13:19.531 --> 13:20.730
the tough guys,

13:20.798 --> 13:22.966
the young guys.

13:23.034 --> 13:25.469
Well, I'm none of those.

13:29.575 --> 13:32.142
But I can make you happy.

13:33.811 --> 13:36.280
Because...
                   you know why?

13:36.347 --> 13:38.081
Because it
                     takes work.

13:38.149 --> 13:40.317
Every morning, I'll
           wake up and I'll say,

13:40.385 --> 13:42.353
"How do I make
                   Emily happy?"

13:42.420 --> 13:44.288
And every night, I'll
               go to bed saying,

13:44.356 --> 13:45.656
"How do I make
                   Emily happy?"

13:45.724 --> 13:47.124
I'll-I'll go to
                    work saying,

13:47.191 --> 13:49.159
"How do I make
                   Emily happy?"

13:49.227 --> 13:50.828
I'll eat
                   lunch saying,

13:50.895 --> 13:53.097
(muffled):
                  "How do I make
                   Emily happy?"

13:55.734 --> 13:57.335
Aw...

13:57.402 --> 13:59.603
Look who's on
                     first base.

14:01.673 --> 14:03.207
Hi, Elaine.
Hi, Tony.

14:03.275 --> 14:04.909
Hey, Jim,
        I just saw <i>E.T.</i>

14:04.976 --> 14:07.078
It was fantastic.
           Fantastic!

14:07.145 --> 14:08.412
I laughed, I cried.

14:08.480 --> 14:09.880
I-I felt like a kid again.

14:09.948 --> 14:11.114
You mean that?

14:11.182 --> 14:14.485
You didn't just say that
    to keep the five bucks?

14:15.587 --> 14:17.388
What does this tell you?

14:17.455 --> 14:18.455
(chuckles)

14:18.523 --> 14:20.057
Alex!

14:21.459 --> 14:23.193
How did you see it
on your shift?

14:23.261 --> 14:24.628
Oh, I was having
a terrible night.

14:24.696 --> 14:25.862
I've been stiffed
by every fare.

14:25.930 --> 14:27.465
Then I took this guy
to a theater--

14:27.532 --> 14:28.599
movie house, right?

14:28.667 --> 14:29.900
Dropped him in front
      of the movie house.

14:29.968 --> 14:31.135
The movie's about to start.
            I said,

14:31.202 --> 14:32.603
"Eh, what the hell? I'll go in."

14:32.671 --> 14:35.639
Hey, if Louie finds out, Alex,
     he's going to can you.

14:35.707 --> 14:37.608
(as E.T.):
             Ouch.

14:39.577 --> 14:41.512
He knows lines!

14:42.613 --> 14:45.182
(as E.T.):
        E.T. phone home.

14:45.250 --> 14:46.616
Home phone.

14:46.684 --> 14:48.418
Phone home, E.T.

14:48.486 --> 14:49.653
(as E.T.):
               Elliott.

14:49.721 --> 14:51.155
Elliott.
                        Elliott.

14:51.223 --> 14:53.391
Elliott.
                     Elliott.

14:53.458 --> 14:55.792
Elliott.
                        Elliott.

15:00.966 --> 15:02.566
Can we finish this conversation
        over at Mario's?

15:02.634 --> 15:03.834
Hey, good idea.
Oh, yeah, great.

15:03.902 --> 15:05.002
Kiddies.

15:05.069 --> 15:06.604
(all conversing,
           laughing)

15:06.672 --> 15:08.272
Oh, oh, wait, wait.

15:08.340 --> 15:11.008
Wait, I...
  I need some advice, Reiger.

15:11.076 --> 15:12.642
Oh, yeah,
sure, Louie.

15:12.710 --> 15:14.578
(as E.T.):
            Be good.

15:14.646 --> 15:16.480
(laughing)
            No, no, no.

15:16.547 --> 15:17.581
This is serious.

15:17.648 --> 15:19.250
This is serious.
                           JEFF:
                     Hey, Louie.

15:19.318 --> 15:20.751
Hey, Louie, it's Emily.

15:20.819 --> 15:22.152
Oh, ooh!
    Oh, hold these, Reiger.

15:22.220 --> 15:23.854
What are you doing?
        Hold those.

15:23.921 --> 15:24.922
We'll get a table.

15:24.990 --> 15:26.123
I-I-I'll see you.

15:27.225 --> 15:28.459
Oh! Hi, Emily.

15:28.527 --> 15:30.327
Hi... yeah, I did that.

15:30.395 --> 15:31.862
Yeah, I did that, too.
                           Yeah.

15:31.930 --> 15:33.297
Look, honey,
  I can't get the blueberries.

15:33.364 --> 15:35.699
I looked... I looked all over
      for the blueberries.

15:35.767 --> 15:38.668
I-I-I went every... I went
  20 different places, but...

15:38.736 --> 15:39.670
No, no.

15:39.738 --> 15:40.871
Yeah, okay.

15:40.939 --> 15:42.472
Well, I'll try.
                 I'll-I'll go...

15:42.540 --> 15:43.607
Okay, I'm sorry.

15:43.674 --> 15:45.743
I'm sorry about
             the... blueberries.

15:45.810 --> 15:46.944
(hangs up phone)

15:47.012 --> 15:48.045
Help him, Alex.

15:48.112 --> 15:50.180
I can't stand to
              see him like this.

15:50.248 --> 15:51.448
Yeah, but blueberries.

15:51.516 --> 15:53.017
I looked for
           blueberries all over.

15:53.085 --> 15:54.151
I can't find blueberries.

15:54.219 --> 15:55.485
It's snowing out there.

15:55.553 --> 15:56.820
ALEX:
Louie, Louie!

15:56.887 --> 15:58.822
I need my
                    blueberries!

15:58.890 --> 15:59.890
Louie!

15:59.958 --> 16:01.124
Louie, Louie,
get out of there.

16:01.192 --> 16:02.259
I can't find the
                    blueberries.

16:02.326 --> 16:03.761
Stop that. Stop it!

16:03.828 --> 16:05.329
Stop it, Louie!

16:05.397 --> 16:06.363
I looked for
                    blueberries.

16:06.430 --> 16:07.832
Louie, listen. Hey!

16:07.899 --> 16:10.067
Now, listen, before we deal
       with your problem,

16:10.134 --> 16:11.968
I want you to answer me
         one question.

16:12.036 --> 16:13.703
What the hell you walking around

16:13.771 --> 16:15.639
dressed like that for
          in the snow?

16:16.741 --> 16:19.376
She didn't like my overcoat.

16:20.879 --> 16:22.546
Well, on behalf
of New York City,

16:22.614 --> 16:25.282
let me say that I'm glad
she liked your pants.

16:28.653 --> 16:32.489
(laughing)

16:32.557 --> 16:34.658
What a guy you are.

16:34.726 --> 16:36.927
Trying to cheer
                  me up, Reiger.

16:36.995 --> 16:38.462
Thanks.

16:38.529 --> 16:41.031
I'm going to talk to
           her about it tonight.

16:41.099 --> 16:43.034
I'll tell her
                 the pants joke.

16:43.101 --> 16:44.234
(laughs)

16:45.336 --> 16:47.270
Maybe she'll
                     talk to me.

16:48.473 --> 16:50.240
She doesn't talk to you?

16:51.342 --> 16:55.011
She doesn't talk to me.

16:55.079 --> 16:58.715
She doesn't go out
      with me... anywhere.

16:59.818 --> 17:02.219
She'd never go
to Mario's with me.

17:02.286 --> 17:04.354
All she does is...

17:04.422 --> 17:07.057
is tell me
to do things.

17:08.159 --> 17:10.861
What do you call a man

17:10.929 --> 17:14.097
who spends two hours

17:14.165 --> 17:16.266
walking through the snow

17:16.334 --> 17:18.469
looking for blueberries?

17:20.105 --> 17:22.606
A romantic fool.

17:22.673 --> 17:24.040
No.

17:24.108 --> 17:26.443
A weenie.

17:26.511 --> 17:30.614
I'm turning
into the same kind of guy

17:30.682 --> 17:33.683
who always made me
want to puke.

17:33.751 --> 17:36.453
One of those weenies
     who would do anything

17:36.521 --> 17:40.391
that a broad asked him
   and then say, "Yes, dear."

17:40.458 --> 17:41.992
One of those guys.

17:42.060 --> 17:44.794
Reiger, don't let me
      become one of those.

17:44.862 --> 17:46.830
Don't let me
become a weenie.
            Louie, Louie, Louie.

17:46.898 --> 17:48.466
I'm becoming a weenie!
                          Louie!

17:48.533 --> 17:50.201
I don't want
to be a weenie.

17:52.336 --> 17:54.738
How did you get
                 into this mess?

17:54.806 --> 17:56.072
How?

17:56.140 --> 17:57.674
How?

17:59.944 --> 18:01.278
Look at her, Reiger.

18:01.346 --> 18:03.313
She's beautiful.

18:04.816 --> 18:06.783
She's beautiful!

18:12.223 --> 18:13.523
EMILY:
Louie?

18:13.591 --> 18:14.891
Oh...

18:14.959 --> 18:16.293
Hi, honey.

18:16.360 --> 18:17.628
Hi, honey.

18:17.696 --> 18:18.728
Oh...
                       Hi.

18:18.796 --> 18:19.796
Oh...

18:19.864 --> 18:20.864
Louie, I just came

18:20.932 --> 18:22.532
from my psychiatrist,

18:22.600 --> 18:25.336
and she says that you and I
       are about to have

18:25.403 --> 18:27.871
the most incredible breakthrough
      in our relationship.

18:27.939 --> 18:30.674
Oh!
             Everything is going
                to be different.

18:30.742 --> 18:32.776
I want to talk to you.
       Come sit with me.

18:32.843 --> 18:34.712
Can I just wash the pits
off my fingers?

18:34.779 --> 18:36.213
No, this is
                  too important.

18:36.281 --> 18:37.748
Come on, sit down.

18:37.815 --> 18:39.349
All right.

18:40.718 --> 18:42.652
Let me get this
straight now, Louie.
          Oh. What?

18:42.720 --> 18:45.723
You know that I have
              always allowed men

18:45.790 --> 18:48.091
to make me the victim.

18:49.561 --> 18:54.498
But you have cared for me
so much that you have forced me

18:54.566 --> 18:55.866
to make you the victim,

18:55.933 --> 18:58.101
and even though I
                love you for it,

18:58.169 --> 18:59.135
it has to stop.
You...

18:59.203 --> 19:01.204
I mean, it has to...
you said you love me!

19:01.272 --> 19:03.774
You said you love me.
You said you love me.

19:03.841 --> 19:06.477
Emily, you not only said
you love me,

19:06.545 --> 19:07.912
but you're talking
to me, Emily!

19:07.979 --> 19:09.880
Of course, I do love you.

19:09.948 --> 19:11.782
Oh, that-that means
we can go out.

19:11.849 --> 19:13.918
We can go out...
we can be seen in public.

19:13.985 --> 19:15.085
We can go to Mario's.

19:15.153 --> 19:16.353
We can go to the park.

19:16.420 --> 19:18.722
We can go places,
Emily.
             No! No, no, no, no.

19:18.790 --> 19:20.390
Don't you see?

19:20.458 --> 19:22.125
We're-we're trapped
                     in these...

19:22.193 --> 19:23.593
What? What? What? What?
                 I don't know...

19:23.661 --> 19:25.362
...in these roles.
                          Roles?
                     What? What?

19:25.429 --> 19:27.631
And, you see, we have
a close relationship,

19:27.698 --> 19:30.167
but it...
but it's sick.

19:30.235 --> 19:32.869
Oh, and I think I know
how all of this started,

19:32.937 --> 19:34.437
and maybe it could
have been avoid...

19:34.505 --> 19:36.106
Do you know what you
should have done?

19:36.173 --> 19:38.208
What?
When I got you
in that bar

19:38.276 --> 19:40.377
and you... and I started
to manipulate you

19:40.445 --> 19:42.279
all over again...
               Yeah, what, what,
               what, what, what?

19:42.346 --> 19:44.348
Well, uh, something...
I mean, anything...
               What, what, what?

19:44.415 --> 19:46.049
This.

19:49.353 --> 19:51.554
Why didn't I
                  think of that?

19:51.622 --> 19:54.391
I'm only saying that you
should have done something

19:54.459 --> 19:56.693
to knock some sense
into me.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.795
And that way,
I would have known

19:58.863 --> 20:00.230
that you cared,

20:00.298 --> 20:02.099
but in a healthy way.

20:02.166 --> 20:03.834
I do care.

20:13.677 --> 20:15.645
It's too late for that.

20:15.713 --> 20:17.580
Louie, there is only one way

20:17.648 --> 20:19.149
that I'm going
      to love you forever.

20:19.216 --> 20:20.250
How? How?

20:20.318 --> 20:21.384
Do-do-do...

20:21.452 --> 20:22.552
I don't think you could do it.

20:22.620 --> 20:25.822
Do-do I have to
           squeeze more oranges?

20:25.890 --> 20:28.558
No, you have to stop
being a victim.

20:28.626 --> 20:30.961
You have to walk
out that door

20:31.028 --> 20:32.796
and never see me again.

20:34.398 --> 20:36.132
W-well, could-couldn't I...

20:36.200 --> 20:38.669
I stay here and
                not be a victim?

20:38.736 --> 20:39.836
No, it-it...

20:39.904 --> 20:41.404
I-I can't resist
        controlling you.

20:41.472 --> 20:42.773
It's too easy.

20:42.841 --> 20:44.040
How long am I supposed
to stand here

20:44.108 --> 20:45.341
with all this stuff
all over me?

20:45.409 --> 20:46.443
Oh, I-I'll get
                    you a towel.

20:46.511 --> 20:47.544
I'll get you a towel!

20:47.612 --> 20:48.645
Here.
                        You see?

20:48.712 --> 20:51.181
(groans)

20:51.249 --> 20:54.551
There's no other way,
           is there?

20:55.653 --> 20:56.686
No.

20:56.754 --> 20:58.421
Oh, wait a minute,
      wait a minute, wait.

20:58.489 --> 21:01.291
Wait, let me...
 let me get this straight here.

21:01.359 --> 21:04.361
You...

21:04.428 --> 21:07.497
will love me...

21:07.565 --> 21:10.534
if I never see you again.

21:10.602 --> 21:12.102
Right.

21:15.940 --> 21:18.275
But if I stay,
       you won't like me?

21:18.343 --> 21:20.677
I'll despise you.

21:22.914 --> 21:25.482
And if I walk
out that door...

21:25.550 --> 21:27.384
I'm yours forever.

21:32.857 --> 21:35.625
You're a very complicated girl,
             Emily.

21:38.630 --> 21:39.830
You want me, don't you?

21:39.897 --> 21:42.266
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
          I want you.

21:42.334 --> 21:45.268
You will never
                 have me totally

21:45.336 --> 21:48.104
until you walk
                  out that door.

21:52.276 --> 21:54.578
Interesting, interesting.

21:54.645 --> 21:56.747
Okay. I-I...

21:56.814 --> 21:59.016
Go a... go ahead.

22:04.823 --> 22:06.823
Oh, Louie.

22:12.063 --> 22:13.664
I am loving you more

22:13.731 --> 22:15.966
with every step you take
       toward that door.

22:22.774 --> 22:24.775
(sighs)

22:24.843 --> 22:26.977
Oh, Louie.

22:32.584 --> 22:34.718
Do we write letters?

22:35.820 --> 22:39.890
I write to you,
    and you never answer me.

22:46.464 --> 22:47.765
Well...
           (chuckles)

22:47.832 --> 22:48.865
I guess it's all right.

22:48.933 --> 22:51.367
I guess... I guess I just...

22:51.435 --> 22:54.471
had my first
  sophisticated relationship.

22:54.539 --> 22:56.173
(chuckles)

22:57.742 --> 23:00.677
You know something, Emily?

23:00.745 --> 23:02.879
Someday...

23:02.947 --> 23:06.049
your Mr. Right
    is going to come along.

23:07.786 --> 23:11.655
And when he does, he's going
   to be wearing a white coat

23:11.722 --> 23:13.990
and carrying a butterfly net.

23:15.493 --> 23:17.593
(laughs)

23:17.661 --> 23:20.063
Oh, and-and another thing.

23:20.131 --> 23:22.833
I knew where to get blueberries,

23:22.901 --> 23:26.136
but it was too far and I
  figured, "The hell with it!"

23:36.313 --> 23:38.882
(theme song playing)

24:00.604 --> 24:02.004
WOMAN:
    <i>Good night, Mr. Walters!</i>

24:02.072 --> 24:03.474
(man grumbling)
