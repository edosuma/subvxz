19:39.800 --> 19:41.567
THAT'S WHY I MARRIED YOU.

19:41.567 --> 19:42.867
REALLY?

19:42.867 --> 19:44.033
YEAH.

19:44.033 --> 19:46.500
I MEAN,
I LOVE EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU,

19:46.500 --> 19:48.467
AND THAT'S
NEVER GONNA CHANGE.

19:54.567 --> 19:56.400
NO BABY, DARLING?

19:56.400 --> 19:58.200
NO.

19:58.200 --> 19:59.667
THEN GIVE ME BACK
THE CHECK.

20:00.867 --> 20:03.000
I HAVE A BABY.

20:09.967 --> 20:12.300
LOOK HOW CUTE THIS IS.

20:12.300 --> 20:15.200
HONEY, YOU'LL
NEVER FIT INTO THAT.

[ LAUGHS ]

20:16.467 --> 20:20.000
ARE YOU DISAPPOINTED
ABOUT THE BABY?

20:20.000 --> 20:21.500
A LITTLE.

20:21.500 --> 20:24.000
I MEAN, ONCE I GOT PAST
THE OVERWHELMING DESIRE

20:24.000 --> 20:25.500
TO JUMP OFF A BRIDGE,

20:25.500 --> 20:27.900
I WAS KIND OF LOOKING FORWARD
TO IT, YOU KNOW?

20:27.900 --> 20:29.734
I KNOW WHAT YOU MEAN.

20:29.734 --> 20:33.300
IT'S GONNA BE GREAT, THOUGH,
SOMEDAY, YOU KNOW?

20:33.300 --> 20:35.900
ME AND YOU
WALKING ARM IN ARM,

20:35.900 --> 20:38.800
PUSHING OUR BABY
THROUGH THE PARK.

20:38.800 --> 20:41.834
YOU WERE GONNA BE
A GREAT FATHER.

20:45.400 --> 20:47.400
YOU WANNA GO
FOR THE DVD PLAYER?

20:47.400 --> 20:49.400
NOT YET.

20:49.400 --> 20:51.000
ME NEITHER.

20:51.000 --> 20:53.300
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
WE CAN'T KEEP PRACTICING.

20:53.300 --> 20:54.500
RIGHT!

20:54.500 --> 20:55.800
[ CHUCKLES ]

20:55.800 --> 20:57.000
WHEE!

20:57.000 --> 21:00.133
I LOVE
YOUR LITTLE LOVE HANDLES!
