00:00.027 --> 00:01.018
I'm Olivia Ross.

00:01.090 --> 00:02.785
I'm a big fan of yours.

00:04.560 --> 00:06.187
Congratulations, Magnum.

00:06.262 --> 00:08.730
You're our new stunt double
for Jack Martin.

00:08.798 --> 00:09.730
Action!

00:14.704 --> 00:15.898
Who are those guys?

00:15.972 --> 00:17.200
The Sushi brothers.

00:18.841 --> 00:20.775
This is the movies, T.C.
The movies!

00:20.843 --> 00:21.901
This is boring.

00:21.978 --> 00:24.003
Would you read lines
with me?

00:24.080 --> 00:25.945
Uh, it says here
they kiss.

01:43.326 --> 01:45.521
<i>Good morning,</i>
<i>ladies and gentlemen.</i>

01:45.595 --> 01:49.258
<i>This concludes our midnight flight</i>
<i>from Los √Ångeles to Honolulu.</i>

01:49.332 --> 01:51.027
<i>It's 7:30 a.m. Local time</i>

01:51.100 --> 01:54.069
<i>and the temperature</i>
<i>is a comfortable 76 degrees.</i>

01:54.137 --> 01:55.764
<i>We hope you've</i>
<i>enjoyed your flight</i>

01:55.838 --> 01:57.066
<i>and that you'll keep us</i>
<i>in mind</i>

01:57.140 --> 01:59.540
<i>for future travel plans.</i>
<i>Mahalo.</i>

02:01.310 --> 02:03.540
<i>Even on the red-eye,</i>
<i>it's wonderful flying</i>

02:03.613 --> 02:05.808
<i>into Honolulu for</i>
<i>a vacation in paradise.</i>

02:06.082 --> 02:07.743
<i>But it's not</i>
<i>nearly so wonderful</i>

02:07.817 --> 02:09.478
<i>when you're</i>
<i>a private investigator</i>

02:09.551 --> 02:11.349
<i>who's spent two weeks</i>
<i>in Bakersfield</i>

02:11.421 --> 02:14.015
<i>on a case and been</i>
<i>stiffed by your client.</i>

02:14.724 --> 02:16.123
<i>It's even worse</i>
<i>when your ride</i>

02:16.192 --> 02:17.784
<i>from the airport</i>
<i>didn't show up</i>

02:17.860 --> 02:19.088
<i>and the cab driver's listening</i>

02:19.162 --> 02:21.096
<i>to the</i> Orange
Blossom Special.

02:22.298 --> 02:23.492
Excuse me.

02:32.008 --> 02:33.202
Do you mind?

02:36.846 --> 02:40.009
This is Kalakawa
Kalakua Road there, mister.

02:40.083 --> 02:42.142
How far down?

02:42.218 --> 02:43.412
It's right up there.

02:43.486 --> 02:44.646
You can sort of
see the gate.

02:44.720 --> 02:47.587
It's right where that guy's
standing by the ladder.

02:48.124 --> 02:49.591
Standing by the ladder?

02:49.659 --> 02:51.058
Wait, no, back up.
Back up.

02:51.127 --> 02:53.755
Okay, brother,
all right.

03:07.009 --> 03:08.306
Hey!

03:11.147 --> 03:12.478
Here, keep the change.

03:12.548 --> 03:14.539
Okay, brother. Right on.

03:27.563 --> 03:29.030
What the...

03:29.165 --> 03:30.655
Hold it!
Cut! Cut! Cut!

03:31.000 --> 03:33.093
What happened?
Are you all right?

03:33.202 --> 03:34.601
Oh, my back.
It's your back?

03:34.670 --> 03:35.602
Yeah.

03:35.671 --> 03:37.138
You better go lie down
for a minute.

03:37.206 --> 03:38.901
Sorry, I didn't know
what was happening.

03:38.975 --> 03:41.136
I saw this ladder,
this guy going over the wall.

03:41.210 --> 03:43.405
You think I'm gonna buy
you're just a Good Samaritan?

03:43.479 --> 03:44.741
I didn't know
he was an actor.

03:44.814 --> 03:47.442
Oh, you thought all these
people and these cameras

03:47.517 --> 03:50.418
were here just to film a one-man
invasion of Robin's Nest.

03:50.486 --> 03:52.818
That's wilder than
the script I'm shooting.

03:52.889 --> 03:54.914
Look, I'm sorry
I wrecked your shot,

03:54.991 --> 03:56.481
or... or whatever it is
you call it.

03:56.559 --> 03:58.527
I'm sorry, fellow.
But, look, I just got back

03:58.594 --> 04:00.152
from the mainland,
and I'm exhausted.

04:00.229 --> 04:02.720
So now, I will get
out of the way, okay?

04:02.798 --> 04:04.959
Hey, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait a minute.

04:06.836 --> 04:08.463
You're Thomas Magnum,
aren't you?

04:08.538 --> 04:09.664
What?

04:09.739 --> 04:11.070
I should've known
right off.

04:11.140 --> 04:13.938
Higgins said you were
gonna be back on Wednesday.

04:14.010 --> 04:16.375
Well, I'm Mert Callaghan,
the director.

04:22.985 --> 04:24.043
It's uncanny.

04:24.120 --> 04:25.519
What's uncanny?

04:26.255 --> 04:28.052
Might be a little young.

04:28.891 --> 04:30.916
It's okay.
There's somebody you've just gotta meet.

04:30.993 --> 04:32.824
Wait a minute.
What are you talking about?

04:32.895 --> 04:33.953
Come on, let's go.

04:34.030 --> 04:35.395
No, I gotta get my bag.

04:35.464 --> 04:36.692
Uh, get his bag.

04:37.533 --> 04:39.933
<i>Zeus, Apollo, attack.</i>

04:44.941 --> 04:46.533
Down, lads. Sit.

04:49.712 --> 04:52.408
Not bad, in here.

04:53.716 --> 04:57.208
But will they do it in front
of the camera, out there?

04:57.286 --> 04:59.254
Mr. Knox, I guarantee
these dogs

04:59.322 --> 05:01.347
will perform under
any circumstances.

05:01.424 --> 05:03.187
They're like
finely-tuned machines

05:03.259 --> 05:05.284
designed to respond
to their master's command.

05:05.361 --> 05:08.057
I don't want machines.
I want a couple of dogs that can act.

05:08.130 --> 05:10.894
They're gonna have to go up
against the boys. I want vicious.

05:10.967 --> 05:13.458
I assure you,
they have multiple levels of ferocity

05:13.536 --> 05:15.697
whatever the situation
should require.

05:19.475 --> 05:21.102
A case in point.

05:21.277 --> 05:24.178
Oh, Magnum, I see
you've finally returned.

05:24.347 --> 05:26.144
This is Thomas Magnum?
Yep.

05:26.215 --> 05:27.614
Yes, indeed.

05:27.717 --> 05:29.082
Excuse me.

05:31.887 --> 05:33.787
Higgins, what is
going on here?

05:34.257 --> 05:37.090
Magnum, may I introduce you
to William B. Knox.

05:37.159 --> 05:38.592
He's producing the film
based on

05:38.661 --> 05:41.186
Robin Masters' latest novel,
<i>Tahiti Kill.</i>

05:41.297 --> 05:43.629
The final days of shooting
will be done here.

05:43.699 --> 05:44.893
How do you do?

05:44.967 --> 05:46.594
Same height,
same build, same face.

05:46.669 --> 05:47.761
A little younger.

05:47.837 --> 05:49.964
I don't know if
Jack will like that.

05:50.039 --> 05:51.267
Are you in good shape?

05:51.340 --> 05:52.864
Are you kidding?
I just saw him jump

05:52.942 --> 05:54.967
over a wall and attack
one of the commandos.

05:55.044 --> 05:56.238
Damn near killed him.

05:56.312 --> 05:57.472
Excellent.
We'll go with him.

05:57.546 --> 05:59.480
Higgins, you're right.
He's perfect.

05:59.548 --> 06:01.175
Congratulations, Magnum.

06:01.250 --> 06:03.741
You're our new
stunt double for Jack Martin.

06:08.391 --> 06:09.585
I took the liberty

06:09.659 --> 06:11.650
of volunteering
your services.

06:11.827 --> 06:14.557
The previous double
had an unfortunate accident.

06:14.964 --> 06:17.091
Robin thought it
a splendid idea.

06:17.166 --> 06:18.531
What kind
of an accident?

06:18.601 --> 06:20.262
Nothing, nothing.
Don't worry about it.

06:20.336 --> 06:22.395
Look, the rest of the stunts
are minimal, Magnum.

06:22.471 --> 06:24.268
I mean, they're not
really stunts at all.

06:24.340 --> 06:26.171
It's just
a little running around.

06:26.242 --> 06:27.732
Did I happen
to mention to you

06:27.810 --> 06:29.277
the kind of money
you'd be making?

06:29.345 --> 06:30.835
It doesn't matter

06:30.913 --> 06:32.471
because I wouldn't
have much fun

06:32.548 --> 06:34.277
spending it
from a wheelchair.

06:34.583 --> 06:35.709
Wheelchair?

06:37.119 --> 06:38.518
He's funny.

06:38.888 --> 06:41.152
Excuse me, Mr. Knox,
but we need the wrangler on the set.

06:41.223 --> 06:43.123
And, Mert, we're ready
whenever you are.

06:43.192 --> 06:44.557
Oh, I'll... I'll be
right there.

06:44.627 --> 06:46.618
Listen, Magnum,
I gotta get back to the set.

06:46.696 --> 06:49.096
Think about it, will you?
We'll talk later.

06:49.165 --> 06:51.326
There's nothing
to talk about.

06:57.373 --> 06:58.897
Welcome aboard.

07:07.016 --> 07:08.483
Who are those guys?

07:08.951 --> 07:10.441
The Sushi brothers.

07:10.686 --> 07:12.950
Sushi is just
a stage name, of course.

07:13.022 --> 07:15.547
Black belts in at least four
or five of the martial arts.

07:15.624 --> 07:17.421
Quite a talented twosome.

07:17.493 --> 07:19.120
Not too chatty, though.

07:19.495 --> 07:20.928
The lads will be
taking them on in

07:20.996 --> 07:23.191
one of the more
action-packed sequences.

07:23.265 --> 07:24.960
I think you'll enjoy
working with them.

07:25.034 --> 07:27.696
The only thing I am
going to be working on

07:27.770 --> 07:29.032
is three days of sleep.

07:29.105 --> 07:31.596
And maybe, just maybe
when I wake up,

07:31.674 --> 07:33.608
all these people
will be gone.

07:38.447 --> 07:39.709
Oh, Higgins.

07:40.383 --> 07:43.477
By the way, what did happen
to the other stunt double?

07:44.653 --> 07:46.484
Insurance took care of it.

07:46.555 --> 07:47.544
Ah.

07:56.098 --> 07:57.497
"You are so lovely.

07:57.566 --> 08:00.831
"Even in your sadness,
now is the time for inner strength.

08:00.903 --> 08:03.167
"I know it's lonely out there.

08:04.006 --> 08:05.633
"It's always lonely

08:05.708 --> 08:08.142
"after they walk away
that last time.

08:09.979 --> 08:11.879
But I'm with you now."

08:13.549 --> 08:14.811
Thomas!

08:14.884 --> 08:17.114
Thanks a lot for picking
me up at the airport.

08:17.186 --> 08:19.620
Buddy, am I glad to see you.
Guess what?

08:19.688 --> 08:21.315
I am gonna be
in a movie.

08:21.457 --> 08:22.890
Oh, no. Not you, too.

08:22.958 --> 08:24.789
Well, I didn't get
the part officially yet,

08:24.860 --> 08:26.691
but I'm quite sure
it's a shoo-in.

08:27.196 --> 08:28.424
A shoo-in?

08:28.497 --> 08:30.590
Yeah. The audition's
in a couple of days.

08:30.666 --> 08:32.929
That's why I've been
practicing every chance I get.

08:33.001 --> 08:35.732
Wait a minute. Isn't it a little
late to be casting a part?

08:35.804 --> 08:37.898
Higgins said this was the
last week of shooting.

08:37.972 --> 08:41.169
The guys were all set but the director
changed some stuff in his character.

08:41.243 --> 08:45.043
They had to get rid of him. That's why
I'm positive this part was meant for me.

08:45.347 --> 08:47.008
Here read this.

08:47.950 --> 08:50.510
"Enter Garson Swift,

08:50.786 --> 08:53.880
a short, debonair,
well-dressed man in his middle 30s."

08:53.956 --> 08:55.890
That's you, all right.
Short.

08:55.958 --> 08:57.516
Hey, come on,
don't be a wisenheimer.

08:57.593 --> 09:00.027
I'm serious, this part
was meant for me, Thomas.

09:00.095 --> 09:02.495
This could be
the start of a big career.

09:03.866 --> 09:05.891
Whoa!
Oh, no, now what?

09:05.968 --> 09:07.299
That's T.C.
With the stars.

09:07.369 --> 09:08.393
The stars?

09:08.471 --> 09:10.598
I'm shivering with delight.

09:12.508 --> 09:15.602
We're talking
Jack Martin and Olivia Ross.

09:15.678 --> 09:16.872
Come on.

09:16.946 --> 09:18.504
Olivia Ross?

09:22.117 --> 09:23.345
Come on.

09:30.593 --> 09:33.687
<i>Jack Martin and Olivia Ross</i>
<i>were the rarest of creatures,</i>

09:33.762 --> 09:36.424
<i>a Hollywood marriage that had</i>
<i>lasted through 15 years</i>

09:36.499 --> 09:37.557
<i>and a dozen pictures</i>

09:37.633 --> 09:40.124
<i>where they'd played</i>
<i>America's dream couple.</i>

09:50.713 --> 09:52.044
<i>As for me?</i>

09:53.415 --> 09:55.645
<i>Well, I'd been secretly</i>
<i>in love with Olivia</i>

09:55.718 --> 09:58.448
<i>from the day that</i>
<i>I'd seen her first picture.</i>

09:59.455 --> 10:00.922
<i>To get close to her,</i>

10:01.023 --> 10:03.014
<i>I'd even become</i>
<i>a stunt double.</i>

10:03.092 --> 10:07.051
<i>Oh, I know, actresses are never supposed</i>
<i>to be like the people they portray,</i>

10:07.129 --> 10:10.121
<i>but somehow, I just didn't</i>
<i>think that applied to Olivia.</i>

10:10.199 --> 10:12.895
<i>She was so wonderful.</i>

10:24.413 --> 10:25.937
You're not using
full loads?

10:26.015 --> 10:28.779
You kidding. I wouldn't
do that to you, Jack.

10:28.851 --> 10:31.012
Sure, sure, I've been
there before.

10:31.086 --> 10:32.713
I'm glad you changed
your mind.

10:32.788 --> 10:34.153
You may as well
meet Jack Martin.

10:34.223 --> 10:35.918
He's getting
wired up over here.

10:35.991 --> 10:39.518
Jack, I'd like you to meet
your new stunt double.

10:39.795 --> 10:41.353
This is
Thomas Magnum.

10:41.497 --> 10:43.089
My God, there is
a resemblance.

10:43.165 --> 10:46.760
Maybe he could do the 52-city
promotional tour and, uh,
I'll take a vacation.

10:46.835 --> 10:49.497
Actually, Magnum was a little
reluctant to take this job.

10:49.572 --> 10:50.937
Nice having you
join us, Magnum.

10:51.006 --> 10:52.769
Okay, finished, Mr. Martin.
Thanks, Tim.

10:52.841 --> 10:54.399
We're set up over here, Jack.

10:54.476 --> 10:56.171
Okay, everybody, let's go.

10:57.112 --> 10:59.307
All right, places, everybody.

10:59.381 --> 11:01.474
Now, if, uh, if you'll get

11:01.550 --> 11:03.780
in place down here,
we can, uh...

11:05.321 --> 11:06.413
Ready?

11:06.488 --> 11:09.082
Yeah, come on.
Check it with my crew.

11:16.498 --> 11:17.658
Oh!
Oh!

11:18.033 --> 11:20.695
I'm so sorry.
Did I step on your foot?

11:20.803 --> 11:22.998
No, no, it's okay.

11:24.907 --> 11:27.000
No, it's okay, really.
It's fine.

11:27.543 --> 11:30.307
I'm, uh, Mr. Martin's
stunt double.

11:31.380 --> 11:33.507
You know, for a second,
I thought you looked

11:33.582 --> 11:35.641
just like Jack
when I married him.

11:36.051 --> 11:37.177
Really?

11:37.886 --> 11:39.478
I'm Olivia Ross.

11:40.889 --> 11:43.483
Oh, yes, I know.
I- I'm Thomas Magnum.

11:45.327 --> 11:46.919
I'm a big fan of yours.

11:46.996 --> 11:48.395
Thank you.

11:49.398 --> 11:50.922
Welcome aboard.

12:00.409 --> 12:03.139
<i>Quiet on the set. Rolling.</i>

12:03.646 --> 12:05.876

12:06.882 --> 12:09.146
And action!

12:09.485 --> 12:11.453
Is that the way
you're going to end it?

12:11.520 --> 12:13.181
Just walk out?

12:13.489 --> 12:15.286
I've done everything
I can do.

12:15.357 --> 12:17.154
The rest is up to you.

12:29.772 --> 12:30.830
Cut it.

12:30.906 --> 12:33.704
That's a cut.
We'll do it once more.

12:34.610 --> 12:35.599
Olivia?

12:35.678 --> 12:37.873
I'm sorry.
Jack, your makeup.

12:38.313 --> 12:39.940
Maybe it's nothing.

12:40.649 --> 12:41.547
What?

12:41.617 --> 12:43.346
Well, you look washed-out.

12:44.286 --> 12:45.810
Is it just me?

12:46.689 --> 12:48.452
He looks fine to me.

12:49.091 --> 12:50.388
Albert?

12:53.595 --> 12:56.257
Wait a minute.
Let me get a touchup.

13:08.944 --> 13:10.468
All right, what's gonna
happen now?

13:10.546 --> 13:12.013
Just wait.
You'll find out.

13:12.081 --> 13:14.379
Wait? I ain't got time
to wait around here all day.

13:14.450 --> 13:16.611
Especially if they're
gonna stop all the time.

13:16.685 --> 13:18.812
This is the movies, T.C.
The movies!

13:18.887 --> 13:21.287
This is boring,
that's what it is.

13:23.525 --> 13:24.822
Take 2.

13:25.521 --> 13:26.579
Action!

13:27.362 --> 13:29.421
Is this the way
you're going to end it?

13:29.498 --> 13:30.897
Just walk out?

13:31.800 --> 13:33.392
I've done everything
I can do.

13:33.535 --> 13:35.162
The rest is up to you.

13:40.909 --> 13:43.309
You're a coward,
just like your brother.

13:43.912 --> 13:46.176
At least he died
a brave man.

13:46.849 --> 13:49.181
You want
a brave man, Stefanie?

13:49.618 --> 13:51.711
Okay, here, shoot me.

13:51.787 --> 13:53.778
I'll die a brave man
for you.

13:58.894 --> 14:01.021
Oh! My body mike slipped.

14:01.296 --> 14:02.354
Cut it.

14:02.431 --> 14:03.898
Can we help you here?

14:03.966 --> 14:05.433
Can we help you
with that?

14:06.902 --> 14:09.132
Ah, why don't we just
go to lunch?

14:09.371 --> 14:10.736
What else?

14:20.382 --> 14:21.610
Take 3.

14:22.251 --> 14:23.445
Action!

14:23.652 --> 14:25.745
It's not gonna work.
You want the gun.

14:26.121 --> 14:27.383
Oh, hell, I'm sorry.

14:27.456 --> 14:29.219
Keep it rolling.
Keep it rolling.

14:29.458 --> 14:31.358
And action!

14:33.195 --> 14:35.595
You're a coward,
just like your brother.

14:36.098 --> 14:38.191
At least he died a brave man.

14:39.134 --> 14:41.125
You want
a brave man, Stefanie?

14:42.204 --> 14:45.401
Okay, here, shoot me.
I'll die a brave man for you.

14:52.981 --> 14:54.448
Now who's a coward?

15:06.328 --> 15:07.488
Jack?

15:10.032 --> 15:12.762
<i>All right, everybody.</i>
<i>Let's get ready to move.</i>

15:16.872 --> 15:18.863
Help me,
somebody, please!

15:23.145 --> 15:24.612
He's been shot for real.

15:24.680 --> 15:25.908
Somebody give me
a hand here.

15:25.981 --> 15:27.175
T.C., roll up
the chopper.

15:27.249 --> 15:28.273
Got it.

15:28.350 --> 15:30.477
Somebody grab his feet.
Higgins.

15:30.552 --> 15:31.883
Call Bishop Emergency.

15:31.954 --> 15:33.751
Tell them to have
their crash team ready.

15:33.822 --> 15:35.847
Oh, my God, Jack!

15:35.944 --> 15:37.050
Jack!

15:41.598 --> 15:43.793
All right, it's gonna
be all right.

15:46.403 --> 15:49.497
Say again, Mr. Masters,
I can barely hear you.

15:50.573 --> 15:52.700
No one knows.
It's quite baffling.

15:53.710 --> 15:55.200
He's still in a coma.

15:55.278 --> 15:57.508
The doctors won't know
for a while.

15:58.515 --> 16:00.244
Well, as well as
could be expected,

16:00.316 --> 16:02.546
uh, she's at the hospital now.

16:02.619 --> 16:03.950
Every day we're shut down,

16:04.020 --> 16:06.318
it's costing
the company $60,000.

16:06.389 --> 16:08.152
You're already
two weeks over.

16:08.224 --> 16:10.385
I want to start up again
as soon as possible.

16:10.460 --> 16:11.688
Tomorrow.

16:11.761 --> 16:12.955
Tomorrow?

16:13.229 --> 16:15.026
Oh, I don't know, Billy.

16:15.098 --> 16:17.726
The crew's pretty shook up.
Lots of grief.

16:18.001 --> 16:20.902
People can grieve and work
at the same time.

16:21.504 --> 16:22.801
I see it a lot.

16:23.306 --> 16:25.433
Yes, if that's what
you want.

16:27.143 --> 16:28.508
Yes, Mr. Masters.

16:29.112 --> 16:31.137
I will keep you informed.

16:31.781 --> 16:32.975
Goodbye.

16:35.418 --> 16:37.511
Robin wants me
to investigate.

16:37.587 --> 16:38.918
Of course.

16:38.988 --> 16:41.821
I hope you do better
than the local cops.

16:42.225 --> 16:44.125
What a bunch
of bozos.

16:44.828 --> 16:47.194
Yeah,
real clowns.

16:50.200 --> 16:52.600
Lt. Tanaka, Homicide.

16:54.738 --> 16:57.104
You must be William B. Knox.

16:57.807 --> 16:59.798
I am a big fan
of yours.

17:00.376 --> 17:02.071
You know,
my favorite picture

17:02.145 --> 17:05.478
was your original version of
<i>23 Guns To Cairo.</i>

17:07.217 --> 17:09.242
I've seen it 16 times.

17:11.121 --> 17:12.145
Thanks.

17:12.222 --> 17:13.519
You know, it's a shame

17:13.589 --> 17:16.752
you haven't done many pictures
in the last couple of years.

17:16.826 --> 17:19.954
Oh, well, it's a feast
or famine kind of business.

17:21.297 --> 17:23.321
And you must be
Mert Callaghan.

17:24.601 --> 17:26.933
Maybe you can
answer a question for me.

17:27.002 --> 17:28.402
I was just curious

17:28.471 --> 17:30.405
about the end
of your last film

17:30.473 --> 17:31.963
where the old blind woman

17:32.041 --> 17:34.271
baked a cake for
the dying psychic.

17:34.344 --> 17:37.211
Were the metaphysical
implications intentional?

17:37.280 --> 17:39.714
Lieutenant,
you did not come here

17:39.783 --> 17:41.683
to discuss cinema,
did you?

17:42.085 --> 17:43.518
Hi, Magnum.
Hi.

17:43.586 --> 17:44.951
How're you doing?
Pretty good.

17:45.021 --> 17:46.511
Hey, you hear?

17:46.589 --> 17:48.250
Tigers traded Kemp.

17:48.625 --> 17:50.092
Yeah, for Lemon.

17:50.160 --> 17:51.422
Uh, you didn't come here

17:51.528 --> 17:53.462
to discuss baseball either,
did you?

17:53.530 --> 17:57.296
Magnum, you just can't stand chitchat,
can you?

17:58.134 --> 18:01.331
Well, actually,
I came here to find out

18:01.671 --> 18:04.504
how a gun
with live ammunition

18:04.808 --> 18:06.901
could be switched
with a prop.

18:06.976 --> 18:09.410
Maybe you ought to ask
the prop man.

18:09.479 --> 18:12.175
You mean Carl?
Yeah, I talked with him.

18:12.749 --> 18:14.478
Oh, he's quite distraught.

18:15.084 --> 18:17.211
You know, he told me
that he's worked

18:17.287 --> 18:19.380
on every one of
Jack's pictures.

18:19.856 --> 18:21.448
Like most of the crew.

18:23.493 --> 18:25.927
Sounds like one
big happy family.

18:26.963 --> 18:28.362
Well, anyway,

18:28.431 --> 18:30.626
I got all
the family's statements.

18:32.268 --> 18:33.997
I'll take yours now.

18:34.304 --> 18:36.670
Who wants
to bat first? Huh?

18:41.010 --> 18:44.104
<i>Tanaka managed to drag</i>
<i>an hour's work into three.</i>

18:44.314 --> 18:46.908
<i>If only to avoid him,</i>
<i>I wanted out of this.</i>

18:47.250 --> 18:48.911
<i>On the other hand,</i>
<i>the woman I grew up</i>

18:48.985 --> 18:51.283
<i>dreaming about</i>
<i>was in a real mess</i>

18:51.354 --> 18:54.221
<i>and I knew I couldn't stop</i>
<i>myself from helping her.</i>

18:56.459 --> 18:58.484
<i>A beautiful woman</i>
<i>in distress.</i>

18:58.561 --> 19:01.860
<i>A reluctant but finally</i>
<i>heroic private investigator.</i>

19:02.165 --> 19:04.258
<i>It was just like the movies.</i>

19:05.134 --> 19:06.761
<i>And I was hooked.</i>

19:25.355 --> 19:26.720
Mrs. Ross.

19:28.791 --> 19:30.383
I was only gone
for a minute.

19:30.526 --> 19:32.118
I hope you won't tell.

19:32.362 --> 19:33.624
Of course not.

19:40.036 --> 19:41.367
Mrs. Ross?

19:43.373 --> 19:45.637
I want you to know
that I've always been

19:45.708 --> 19:48.006
a big fan of both
you and Mr. Martin.

19:48.444 --> 19:49.934
I always wanted
to meet you.

19:50.079 --> 19:51.569
Since I was a kid.

19:52.849 --> 19:54.407
I can't tell you
how sorry I am

19:54.484 --> 19:56.384
that it had
to be like this.

19:57.153 --> 19:58.279
Thank you.

19:59.255 --> 20:02.816
You know, I've seen him
in so many pictures,

20:02.892 --> 20:04.883
all of that action stuff.

20:07.630 --> 20:09.962
It's hard to believe
that something could...

20:10.033 --> 20:12.001
could really happen to him.

20:12.869 --> 20:16.168
You know, it's hard
to believe that he's...

20:16.239 --> 20:18.264
He's a real human being.

20:18.408 --> 20:20.433
Yeah, I guess.

20:21.544 --> 20:24.206
I can't tell you
how really human he is.

20:26.516 --> 20:28.108
That's why I love him.

20:36.192 --> 20:37.989
Oh, Olivia.

20:41.197 --> 20:43.631
Olivia, is... is... is he...

20:44.567 --> 20:45.864
Not yet.

20:50.540 --> 20:53.065
Let's get out of here
and grab some coffee.

21:07.924 --> 21:10.085
Well, we're here.

21:11.094 --> 21:12.789
Here's your coffee.

21:14.197 --> 21:15.391
Thanks.

21:15.465 --> 21:17.695
Did you tell her about
the... the guy with the gun?

21:17.767 --> 21:18.791
No.
Ugh.

21:19.435 --> 21:22.268
There's this, uh, cop
who's been nosing around.

21:22.405 --> 21:24.669
Unbelievable, this guy.
He's a lunatic.

21:24.741 --> 21:26.538
Yeah, he thinks
one of us did it.

21:27.076 --> 21:29.544
Yeah. I mean, I was
never even near the gun.

21:29.612 --> 21:31.239
Nobody was near the gun,

21:31.314 --> 21:34.340
except special effects
and props and...

21:34.417 --> 21:35.611
And me.

21:38.621 --> 21:42.421
You know, sometimes you really
say stupid things, Billy Knox.

21:42.959 --> 21:44.392
It's okay, Mert.

21:44.460 --> 21:45.893
He's only saying out loud

21:45.962 --> 21:48.157
what I'm sure
everyone else is thinking.

21:48.231 --> 21:50.563
Did she or didn't she?

21:52.268 --> 21:53.565
That's not true.

21:53.636 --> 21:55.900
Did she finally find out
about his affair

21:55.972 --> 21:58.338
with that stand-in
on his last picture?

21:58.908 --> 22:01.172
No, no. Nobody... Nobody's
been thinking that.

22:01.244 --> 22:02.973
The only thing
they're thinking is

22:03.046 --> 22:04.707
what a terrible tragedy
this is.

22:04.781 --> 22:07.079
Mert and I, we came over here
in an attempt to see you,

22:07.150 --> 22:09.516
be with you,
help if we could.

22:10.386 --> 22:12.911
Everybody's just
as concerned for you, Olivia,

22:12.989 --> 22:14.889
as they are for Jack.

22:14.957 --> 22:19.621
But, well, we've all
just gotta keep on going.

22:21.230 --> 22:24.063
I mean, you've gotta
keep on going.

22:25.501 --> 22:28.026
Jack would want that.
Yeah.

22:28.171 --> 22:31.140
Oh, yeah, absolutely.
I mean, Mert's right.

22:31.207 --> 22:33.437
You know the best thing
for you right now?

22:33.509 --> 22:35.374
Keep right on working.

22:35.878 --> 22:38.278
It would certainly
take your mind off things,

22:38.347 --> 22:40.178
give you a... a focus.

22:40.249 --> 22:42.581
Besides, you're a pro.

22:43.719 --> 22:45.710
I don't believe you two.

22:45.788 --> 22:48.723
Jack could be dying
and all that you care about

22:48.791 --> 22:50.918
is finishing
your damn picture.

22:50.993 --> 22:52.255
Olivia,

22:54.030 --> 22:55.725
we care about you.

22:56.299 --> 22:58.733
Oh, you are
so transparent, Billy.

22:58.935 --> 23:01.904
You haven't had a hit since
<i>23 Guns To Cairo,</i>

23:01.971 --> 23:03.666
and you need this one bad.

23:04.006 --> 23:05.371
Olivia!

23:08.945 --> 23:10.640
Now, wait a minute.

23:11.747 --> 23:13.942
We've all been through a lot.

23:14.951 --> 23:18.079
There's no reason
to attack, Olivia.

23:18.488 --> 23:20.183
Oh, spare me, Mert.

23:21.057 --> 23:22.854
The only picture
you've ever done

23:22.925 --> 23:26.088
had dark lighting,
an incomprehensible script,

23:26.162 --> 23:29.029
and the Danish coastline.
So you need it, too.

23:31.000 --> 23:32.558
I don't.

23:33.236 --> 23:34.533
Olivia.

23:49.051 --> 23:50.985
Hey, can I have
your watch and ring please?

23:51.053 --> 23:52.953
My watch and my ring?
Yeah, it won't match.

23:53.022 --> 23:54.887
I'll take care of it.
Don't worry about it.

23:54.957 --> 23:56.584
I'll take good care of it,
don't worry.

23:56.659 --> 23:57.887
All right.

23:58.361 --> 24:00.090
Okay, thanks very much.

24:00.997 --> 24:03.693
<i>All right, people,</i>
<i>let's get ready.</i>

24:04.300 --> 24:06.063
I don't see what
all the fuss is about.

24:06.135 --> 24:08.262
You don't look like Jack Martin,
short or healthy.

24:08.337 --> 24:09.634
Are you getting
a screen credit?

24:09.705 --> 24:11.400
I don't know.
I'm only doing this

24:11.474 --> 24:13.101
so I can hang out
with these people.

24:13.176 --> 24:14.973
Yeah. Yeah.

24:16.012 --> 24:17.775
You coming close
to find out who did it?

24:17.847 --> 24:18.905
No.

24:18.981 --> 24:20.346
I sure hope
those Sushi brothers

24:20.416 --> 24:21.849
know how to
pull their punches.

24:21.918 --> 24:23.647
It's their kicks
I'd be worrying about.

24:23.719 --> 24:26.153
You think they
won't pull their kicks?

24:28.024 --> 24:29.924
Scene 75, Take 1.

24:30.526 --> 24:32.221
Now, remember, falter.

24:32.428 --> 24:35.795
And action, Magnum!

24:39.569 --> 24:41.662
All right,
Sushi brothers, come on.

24:44.307 --> 24:45.706
Cue the dogs, Higgins.

24:45.775 --> 24:47.538
Zeus, Apollo, attack.

24:49.979 --> 24:50.968
Cut!

24:51.047 --> 24:52.071
Higgins!

24:52.148 --> 24:53.809
Down, lads. Back.

24:58.654 --> 25:01.851
Higgins, the dogs are
supposed to attack

25:01.924 --> 25:04.188
the Sushi brothers,
not Magnum.

25:04.260 --> 25:06.820
Sorry, force of habit.
It won't happen again.

25:09.165 --> 25:10.530
Seventy-six. Take 1.

25:10.600 --> 25:12.329
<i>Action!</i>

25:21.177 --> 25:22.235
Take 3.

25:28.484 --> 25:29.610
Take 7.

25:37.193 --> 25:38.285
Take 10.

25:50.506 --> 25:51.598
Cut it.

25:51.674 --> 25:54.199
<i>Save it. That's a print.</i>

25:55.611 --> 25:56.805
Get wardrobe.

25:56.879 --> 25:58.210
Wardrobe. Wardrobe.

25:58.281 --> 26:00.181
Get some robes for
the Sushi brothers.

26:00.249 --> 26:01.273
They're soaking wet.

26:26.193 --> 26:27.319
Mert?

26:44.745 --> 26:47.873
I'm sorry.
I was looking for Mert.

26:48.548 --> 26:50.345
I was at the hospital
all afternoon.

26:50.417 --> 26:53.079
When I came back,
they said I'd find her here.

26:53.153 --> 26:55.383
Oh, uh, she went
to dinner with Knox.

26:55.455 --> 26:56.615
Oh.

26:56.690 --> 26:58.351
How's Mr. Martin?

26:59.826 --> 27:01.191
No change.

27:01.261 --> 27:03.195
Tomorrow they're going
to try and get out

27:03.263 --> 27:04.753
the bullet from
near his lung.

27:04.831 --> 27:05.957
They're worried.

27:06.032 --> 27:07.397
Oh.

27:07.467 --> 27:09.196
Sorry to intrude.
I'll... I'll go.

27:09.269 --> 27:11.203
No, no, that's all right.

27:11.271 --> 27:12.533
Can I get you anything?

27:12.606 --> 27:13.800
No, thank you.

27:13.874 --> 27:15.136
Anything at all?

27:15.208 --> 27:16.232
No, really.

27:16.309 --> 27:18.334
You're sure? A drink?
No.

27:19.579 --> 27:21.274
Oh, thank you.
Okay.

27:30.357 --> 27:32.416
May I tell you
something foolish?

27:32.492 --> 27:33.891
Sure.

27:35.762 --> 27:37.753
I really came
to see you.

27:39.566 --> 27:40.624
Me?

27:42.269 --> 27:45.466
Well, I don't know you
very well,

27:46.373 --> 27:48.102
but you have a look

27:48.175 --> 27:51.474
in the eyes, especially,
that's very much like Jack.

27:52.446 --> 27:55.108
When he was
younger and happier.

27:56.116 --> 27:58.676
Maybe a little more
in love with me.

28:01.455 --> 28:03.889
I'm sorry.
Now I really do feel foolish.

28:04.991 --> 28:06.891
Oh, there's
no need to be.

28:09.296 --> 28:11.025
You're very kind

28:12.365 --> 28:15.732
and modest, which is where
you and Jack part company.

28:17.637 --> 28:19.366
Would you do me a favor?

28:19.506 --> 28:20.598
Sure.

28:20.674 --> 28:22.232
Would you read lines with me?

28:22.309 --> 28:24.743
I'd really like to get
my mind off things.

28:24.845 --> 28:27.075
Me? I'm not an actor.

28:27.314 --> 28:30.442
Well, go on, give it a try.
Where's your script?

28:30.617 --> 28:32.209
It's over here.
Oh.

28:37.290 --> 28:38.484
Okay.

28:39.659 --> 28:40.648
Um,

28:42.162 --> 28:43.959
you read the part of Victor.

28:44.564 --> 28:46.361
Scene 79.

28:50.504 --> 28:51.835
All right.

28:51.905 --> 28:53.236
All right.

28:54.307 --> 28:56.172
I'll start, all right?

29:00.480 --> 29:02.471
"Just tell me
one thing, Victor.

29:03.216 --> 29:05.946
What really happened
to your first wife?"

29:08.622 --> 29:10.886
"I loaned her to a friend
while I was out of town.

29:10.957 --> 29:13.221
"She was never
the same after that.

29:13.426 --> 29:15.360
"Her bottom was
covered with barnacles,

29:15.428 --> 29:17.293
"and her nose was
cracked down the middle.

29:17.364 --> 29:19.525
There was nothing"...
Where are you reading?

29:19.599 --> 29:21.999
Are you...
Are you on Scene 79?

29:22.068 --> 29:23.467
Yeah.

29:23.537 --> 29:24.936
Let me see.

29:26.473 --> 29:28.600
Oh, that's an old draft.

29:28.775 --> 29:31.243
Come on,
we'll read from mine.

29:31.511 --> 29:32.876
Oh, all right.

29:41.421 --> 29:42.752
Shall we try it again?

29:42.822 --> 29:43.982
All right.

29:47.394 --> 29:49.692
"Just tell me
one thing, Victor.

29:52.532 --> 29:54.932
What really happened
to your first wife?"

29:56.503 --> 29:58.869
No, no, we'll start again,
all right?

29:59.205 --> 30:00.433
Sure.

30:03.243 --> 30:05.234
Just tell me
one thing, Victor.

30:06.046 --> 30:08.446
What really happened
to your first wife?

30:11.451 --> 30:13.681
"I don't know.
Uh, she left the country,

30:13.753 --> 30:15.812
"and I never
heard from her again.

30:16.222 --> 30:17.519
"But it never
mattered because

30:17.591 --> 30:20.151
then I met you
and my life was changed."

30:22.128 --> 30:24.460
Oh, Victor,
I want to believe that.

30:24.798 --> 30:28.165
It would make our time apart
so much easier to bear.

30:35.241 --> 30:38.074
"Believe it, Stefanie,
because I love you."

30:38.712 --> 30:39.701
Ahem.

30:43.383 --> 30:45.283
Uh, it says here they kiss.

31:11.044 --> 31:12.671
Excuse me, I...

31:13.980 --> 31:15.743
For a second, I...

31:17.684 --> 31:19.481
Bravo, bravo.

31:20.220 --> 31:22.085
I am really impressed.

31:22.689 --> 31:24.350
That was so real.

31:24.958 --> 31:27.518
Tanaka, for once,
I want a straight answer out of you.

31:27.594 --> 31:30.062
What the hell are you doing
in my guest house?

31:30.130 --> 31:33.896
Magnum, I came here
to arrest your guest

31:35.402 --> 31:37.427
for shooting
her husband.

31:54.487 --> 31:56.546
How bad do things look?

31:56.623 --> 31:58.022
Pretty bad.

31:59.759 --> 32:01.420
That's what I thought.

32:05.632 --> 32:08.396
I said it was bad.
I didn't say it was hopeless.

32:09.502 --> 32:10.992
I'm so tired.

32:11.905 --> 32:14.066
I'm cold. Hold me.

32:23.049 --> 32:26.644
We've been working nonstop
on this film for three months.

32:27.520 --> 32:28.782
We thought
coming to Hawaii

32:28.855 --> 32:31.187
would be like
a vacation for us.

32:31.357 --> 32:34.053
Jack's shrink said
it would do a worid of good.

32:35.929 --> 32:37.794
Jack sees
a psychiatrist?

32:37.964 --> 32:40.091
In this industry,
doesn't everyone?

32:41.334 --> 32:43.768
Lots of fragile egos
in Hollywood.

32:44.604 --> 32:46.504
How fragile is Jack's?

32:49.209 --> 32:52.201
Like most actors,
he's insecure about himself.

32:53.012 --> 32:55.310
He hasn't had a hit
for quite a while.

32:56.216 --> 32:58.343
So I suppose he's depressed.

32:58.618 --> 33:00.210
Enough to worry you?

33:01.254 --> 33:03.984
I'm concerned.
I mean, he's my husband.

33:04.691 --> 33:06.682
But he's dealing with it.

33:07.994 --> 33:09.120
How?

33:10.463 --> 33:12.226
No more girlfriends.

33:13.466 --> 33:15.696
No more cheap affairs
with women who want

33:15.769 --> 33:18.397
bed time with Jack Martin,
the movie star.

33:20.707 --> 33:22.732
He's taken
a really long, harsh look

33:22.809 --> 33:25.505
at himself, and gone
for professional help.

33:26.546 --> 33:28.844
I really thought
he was better.

33:32.018 --> 33:34.111
Are you trying
to convince me

33:35.021 --> 33:36.420
or yourself?

33:56.042 --> 33:58.510
Miss, I'm ready now.

34:09.755 --> 34:10.916
Tom.

34:12.792 --> 34:14.054
Help me.

34:21.400 --> 34:23.335
<i>Oh, you're grandstanding,</i>
<i>Lieutenant.</i>

34:23.402 --> 34:25.667
You know me, Magnum.
I'm not that kind of guy.

34:25.737 --> 34:28.571
Oh, no? Out of the blue,
you just go and arrest Olivia Ross

34:28.641 --> 34:31.166
for the murder attempt on her husband?
It doesn't make sense.

34:31.244 --> 34:32.302
Really?

34:32.378 --> 34:33.868
What part doesn't
make sense to you?

34:33.947 --> 34:35.915
Well, what do you got
on her? Why Olivia?

34:36.014 --> 34:37.983
Why not Carl,
the prop man?

34:38.484 --> 34:40.782
Carl gave Mr. Martin
a prop gun.

34:40.853 --> 34:43.482
He has lots of witnesses
to back that one up.

34:43.556 --> 34:45.387
He puts a white stripe
on the clip,

34:45.458 --> 34:47.891
indicates how much powder
there is in that cartridge.

34:47.960 --> 34:49.087
Okay, what about
the others?

34:49.161 --> 34:51.722
What about Mert Callaghan
or William Knox?

34:51.831 --> 34:54.129
Carl gave the gun
to two people.

34:54.199 --> 34:55.963
One of them was Mr. Martin.

34:56.034 --> 34:58.060
The other one was Miss Ross.

34:58.137 --> 35:01.937
Mr. Martin is now
in the hospital almost dead.

35:02.308 --> 35:04.071
The other one was Miss Ross.

35:04.143 --> 35:06.202
Still doesn't
make sense to you?

35:06.279 --> 35:07.473
Have you found
the prop gun?

35:07.547 --> 35:08.673
No.

35:08.748 --> 35:11.478
My guess is she dumped it.
Probably in the ocean.

35:11.551 --> 35:13.041
And what's her motive?

35:13.152 --> 35:14.585
I gotta be honest with you.

35:14.654 --> 35:17.350
I don't have anything solid
on that one yet.

35:17.457 --> 35:20.255
But I've heard some stuff.
You know, this Martin fellow,

35:20.326 --> 35:22.157
he's really fine
with the ladies.

35:22.228 --> 35:24.253
What? You arrest someone
based on gossip?

35:24.330 --> 35:26.696
I arrested someone
based on fact.

35:26.900 --> 35:29.164
She had the gun and time
to make the switch.

35:29.235 --> 35:31.066
Well, maybe you believe that.

35:31.204 --> 35:33.536
Maybe you've
convinced yourself.

35:35.875 --> 35:37.740
But you haven't
convinced me.

35:44.550 --> 35:46.177
He'll only hurt you

35:46.286 --> 35:48.618
like he's done
so many times before.

35:48.988 --> 35:51.821
Stefanie, let him go.

35:52.292 --> 35:53.782
Let him leave.

35:54.294 --> 35:56.524
"I can't, Garson.
I need him.

35:56.796 --> 35:58.354
Oh, do l"...
But you can't depend...

35:58.431 --> 35:59.921
Quit jumping ahead.

35:59.999 --> 36:01.728
I still got one more line.

36:03.603 --> 36:05.935
"I can't, Garson.
I need him.

36:06.005 --> 36:07.529
"Oh, do I need him.

36:07.607 --> 36:09.165
He's my life."

36:09.742 --> 36:11.972
But you can't
depend on him.

36:12.045 --> 36:13.569
Not anymore.

36:20.787 --> 36:22.152
T.C.?

36:23.856 --> 36:25.915
Would you say your line,
for crying out loud?

36:25.992 --> 36:27.118
Hold on.

36:27.193 --> 36:29.252
It says here
you're supposed to grab

36:29.329 --> 36:31.991
Stefanie by the shoulders
and shake her.

36:32.065 --> 36:33.327
T.C., that doesn't matter.

36:33.399 --> 36:35.196
Now will you
read the line?

36:37.470 --> 36:39.062
"Let go of me."

36:39.973 --> 36:41.531
Can't you put
a little more into it?

36:41.607 --> 36:43.541
How am I supposed
to react off of:

36:43.609 --> 36:45.008
"Let go of me."

36:45.078 --> 36:46.545
Hey, man, I'm doing
the best I can.

36:46.612 --> 36:49.410
You ain't no Sir Laurence
Olivier yourself, Orville.

36:49.482 --> 36:51.575
What do you expect
with you as my leading lady?

36:51.651 --> 36:53.642
Who's Laurence Olivier?
That does it.

36:53.720 --> 36:55.779
I don't need
this acting madness.

36:56.089 --> 36:57.886
T.C.? T.C.?

36:57.957 --> 36:59.390
You don't like
my performance,

36:59.459 --> 37:01.427
you get you
somebody else.

37:02.095 --> 37:03.255
Like him.

37:03.329 --> 37:05.024
Hey, what's the matter
with you guys?

37:05.098 --> 37:06.588
I'm not working
with him anymore.

37:06.666 --> 37:08.258
Hey, I'd rather
fly my chopper

37:08.334 --> 37:09.858
through automatic
weapons fire

37:09.936 --> 37:11.460
than do any kind
of acting with you.

37:11.537 --> 37:13.368
You know...
You know something...

37:13.439 --> 37:15.304
Cut it out, will you?
I need your help.

37:15.375 --> 37:16.399
T.C.?

37:16.476 --> 37:18.171
Sure, man,
I'd rather do anything

37:18.244 --> 37:20.508
than acting parts
with Mickey Rooney here.

37:27.887 --> 37:29.115
Where're we going?

37:29.188 --> 37:30.587
Shh. Just follow me.

37:30.656 --> 37:32.590
I've heard that before.

37:38.364 --> 37:40.855
Didn't the cops
search everything already?

37:43.269 --> 37:45.328
Here, T.C., hold the light
on the door.

37:45.405 --> 37:46.895
You said you was
going searching.

37:46.973 --> 37:48.600
Now you're
breaking and entering.

37:48.674 --> 37:50.437
What makes you think
the gun's in here?

37:50.510 --> 37:51.943
'Cause just
before he was shot,

37:52.011 --> 37:54.502
Jack went in the motor home
to fix his makeup.

37:54.580 --> 37:56.548
And he had the gun
with him.

38:02.121 --> 38:03.554
Ow!

38:03.623 --> 38:05.056
Shh!

38:05.124 --> 38:06.648
Watch it, T.C.

38:06.759 --> 38:08.659
Shh, wait a minute.
I feel something.

38:08.728 --> 38:10.491
Yeah,
it's my foot.

38:10.596 --> 38:11.756
Oh?

38:13.099 --> 38:15.499
Hey, T.C., bring that light
back here, will you?

38:15.568 --> 38:17.502
I can't see anything.

38:17.904 --> 38:19.963
I'm looking for a switch.

38:22.508 --> 38:23.998
Oh, there you go.

38:29.148 --> 38:32.311
5- O must have used a
vacuum cleaner on this rig.

38:34.220 --> 38:37.280
So you saying that Jack
switched guns or something, huh?

38:37.356 --> 38:39.017
I'm hoping he did.

38:42.328 --> 38:44.762
Hey, come on, you guys.
You're not looking.

38:44.831 --> 38:47.527
Yeah, but you're
talking about suicide.

38:47.967 --> 38:51.698
Look, Olivia said that Jack
had been real depressed lately.

38:52.105 --> 38:54.596
Maybe he was more depressed
than people thought.

38:54.674 --> 38:57.142
Come on, Thomas.
Enough to kill himself?

38:57.210 --> 39:00.236
Yeah, that's a little crazy,
even for these people.

39:00.313 --> 39:02.838
I mean, it's one thing
to commit suicide,

39:02.915 --> 39:04.883
but to set it up
as part of a scene,

39:04.951 --> 39:06.885
and then have
your wife kill you?

39:06.953 --> 39:08.818
Sounds real
far-fetched to me.

39:24.937 --> 39:26.461
And real sick.

39:27.424 --> 39:29.289
Miss Ross, Miss Ross,
do you have any idea

39:29.359 --> 39:31.327
why your husband
wanted to kill himself?

39:31.395 --> 39:33.386
Miss Ross isn't answering
any questions.

39:33.463 --> 39:35.954
How will this affect
the film completion, Mr. Knox?

39:36.033 --> 39:38.331
The film is
virtually complete.

39:38.402 --> 39:41.394
Do you think the publicity
concerning Mr. Martin's accident

39:41.471 --> 39:42.995
will favorably
affect the box office?

39:43.073 --> 39:45.337
Will you use any
of the footage in the film?

39:45.409 --> 39:46.842
Even though
you've been exonerated,

39:46.910 --> 39:48.400
do you feel responsible
in any way

39:48.478 --> 39:49.911
for your husband's
mental state

39:49.980 --> 39:52.346
that led to his
attempted suicide?

39:55.886 --> 39:58.616
Forget him.
Let's go. Now.

40:01.358 --> 40:02.825
Am I responsible?

40:02.893 --> 40:04.520
There have been rumors
of Mr. Martin's

40:04.595 --> 40:06.153
increased alcohol
consumption.

40:06.230 --> 40:08.425
And of the deterioration
within your marriage.

40:08.498 --> 40:10.693
I don't know
any of you people.

40:10.767 --> 40:14.203
But you seem to know everything
there is about me, about my husband,

40:14.271 --> 40:15.966
even about our marriage.

40:16.406 --> 40:18.601
Our lives are nothing,
are they?

40:18.675 --> 40:20.836
Just a story,
an open book.

40:21.445 --> 40:25.381
You invade our privacy, our homes,
you go through our trash.

40:25.649 --> 40:27.514
You take everything
that you can find

40:27.584 --> 40:30.553
and spread it across every
newspaper in the country.

40:31.421 --> 40:34.447
And while my husband
lies dying in a hospital,

40:34.658 --> 40:36.717
you are speculating
on the effect

40:36.793 --> 40:39.284
that the publicity
will have on our picture.

40:39.363 --> 40:41.888
And you have the audacity
to ask me

40:41.965 --> 40:44.729
whether I feel responsible
for his mental health?

40:50.374 --> 40:52.399
Well, thank you very much.

40:52.476 --> 40:53.966
Thanks, bye.

41:08.258 --> 41:11.250
<i>I'd done my part</i>
<i>to save the lady in distress.</i>

41:11.328 --> 41:13.489
<i>But life isn't as neat</i>
<i>as the movies.</i>

41:13.563 --> 41:16.191
<i>It doesn't fade out</i>
<i>after the happy ending.</i>

41:16.433 --> 41:19.425
<i>I'd go back to divorces</i>
<i>and missing persons.</i>

41:19.670 --> 41:22.605
<i>Olivia Ross would go on</i>
<i>to another location.</i>

41:23.273 --> 41:25.366
<i>I'd probably</i>

41:25.876 --> 41:27.173
Tom?

41:29.980 --> 41:31.277
I thought
you'd be asleep.

41:31.348 --> 41:32.440
No.

41:32.983 --> 41:35.543
A warm bath,
fresh change works wonders.

41:35.619 --> 41:37.143
I'm glad I found you.

41:38.355 --> 41:41.085
I expected to see you
at my release

41:41.158 --> 41:43.251
from that awful
police station.

41:43.994 --> 41:46.360
Well, I just thought
I'd be in the way.

41:46.863 --> 41:48.797
There's that modesty again.

41:48.865 --> 41:51.425
You know, you carry it
too far sometimes.

41:55.105 --> 41:56.504
You know,

41:58.775 --> 42:01.505
I've played this scene
a lot for film

42:01.778 --> 42:04.713
but in real life,
words seem so inadequate.

42:05.282 --> 42:07.307
How do you say "thank you"

42:07.918 --> 42:10.386
and have it carry
everything you feel?

42:11.922 --> 42:13.583
It carries plenty.

42:19.896 --> 42:21.261
They're showing
dailies inside.

42:21.331 --> 42:24.789
What do you say we go see
how photogenic you are?

42:24.868 --> 42:26.358
Miss Ross?

42:28.438 --> 42:29.803
Hello, Higgins.

42:29.873 --> 42:31.204
The hospital just called.

42:31.274 --> 42:33.799
Mr. Martin regained
consciousness for a few minutes.

42:33.877 --> 42:35.367
He appears
to be improving.

42:35.445 --> 42:36.776
Oh, thank God.

42:38.482 --> 42:40.575
Can I take your car?
Of course.

42:40.650 --> 42:42.208
I can drive you.

42:42.285 --> 42:44.048
No, no, you go see
your dailies.

42:44.121 --> 42:46.681
No, no, I-I'm sure
I can see them anytime.

42:49.393 --> 42:51.418
I'd better see him alone.

42:53.430 --> 42:54.761
You're a dear.

43:01.171 --> 43:02.160
Well,

43:02.873 --> 43:05.501
shall we go see
how photogenic you are?

43:10.247 --> 43:11.737
That'll work.

43:15.252 --> 43:16.583
Damn good.

43:22.459 --> 43:24.484
I say, this is delightful.

43:28.498 --> 43:30.159
And so close to reality.

43:30.233 --> 43:31.530
That's terrific.
You see the way

43:31.601 --> 43:33.762
they flipped him
into the water?

43:34.037 --> 43:35.937
Oh, that really played.

43:39.276 --> 43:41.039
If you'll excuse me.

43:41.178 --> 43:42.770
You needn't
be embarrassed, Magnum.

43:42.846 --> 43:44.939
It's a
stellar performance.

43:50.253 --> 43:51.481
Uh-uh.

43:51.555 --> 43:52.681
Here it comes, guys.

43:52.756 --> 43:54.656
You sure you
wanna watch this?

44:12.709 --> 44:14.438
Now wait a minute.

44:15.779 --> 44:17.906
Wait a minute.
Wait. No, just a minute.

44:17.981 --> 44:19.312
Can you back this up?

44:19.382 --> 44:20.610
Yeah, sure.
Magnum.

44:20.684 --> 44:22.481
No, just back it up.

44:25.822 --> 44:27.619
Stop it right there.

44:28.992 --> 44:30.584
Are these takes
printed in order?

44:30.660 --> 44:32.218
Well, these here
are, yeah. Why?

44:32.295 --> 44:36.391
And this was taken after Jack got his
makeup adjusted in the motor home?

44:36.466 --> 44:37.592
That's right.

44:38.401 --> 44:40.926
What're you talking about?
That's the prop gun, isn't it?

44:41.004 --> 44:42.369
The white stripe on it?

44:42.439 --> 44:43.531
Yes.

44:44.241 --> 44:45.731
I say, Magnum.

44:50.146 --> 44:52.171
He does that all the time.

44:53.049 --> 44:54.243
Does what?

44:54.384 --> 44:55.612
Never mind.

45:43.366 --> 45:44.355
Tom?

45:45.068 --> 45:46.831
What are you doing here?

45:48.772 --> 45:51.036
I came to stop you
from trying again.

45:51.308 --> 45:52.400
What?

46:06.222 --> 46:08.087
You switched the guns.

46:08.291 --> 46:10.020
What were you
gonna do this time?

46:10.093 --> 46:11.754
Pump his heart
full of air?

46:11.828 --> 46:13.227
What are you
talking about?

46:13.296 --> 46:14.888
Oh, you're really terrific,
Olivia.

46:14.965 --> 46:16.523
It's too bad
this isn't a movie.

46:16.600 --> 46:18.295
Tom, what is this?

46:18.501 --> 46:20.662
When Jack came back
from the motor home,

46:20.737 --> 46:22.762
he still had the prop gun.

46:23.073 --> 46:25.303
Oh, it's all in the dailies.
I saw a white stripe

46:25.375 --> 46:27.366
on the bottom
of the magazine.

46:28.945 --> 46:31.106
No, no, you switched the guns,

46:31.181 --> 46:34.150
afterward, when you had
trouble with your mike.

46:34.217 --> 46:35.479
That isn't true, Tom.

46:35.552 --> 46:37.782
You found
the prop gun yourself.

46:38.288 --> 46:40.882
I let you lead me
around by the nose.

46:41.257 --> 46:43.191
You made me think
Jack was suicidal,

46:43.326 --> 46:45.294
and you planted
the gun in the icemaker.

46:45.362 --> 46:47.830
Oh, you played me
really well, Olivia.

46:48.632 --> 46:49.929
Tom...
Why?

46:53.670 --> 46:55.797
Okay, you're right.

46:57.240 --> 47:00.437
But I hope you don't
expect me to turn myself in.

47:01.778 --> 47:04.576
Really? What else can you do?

47:06.182 --> 47:07.615
What have you got?

47:07.684 --> 47:10.380
You got a piece of film
that's probably not too clear.

47:10.453 --> 47:12.045
Could be a mistake.

47:13.056 --> 47:15.684
And if you think this has
been a good performance,

47:15.759 --> 47:17.727
you wait until
you see Olivia Ross

47:17.794 --> 47:19.694
on the witness stand,
mister.

47:19.763 --> 47:22.527
She'll have them
eating out of her hand.

47:22.666 --> 47:25.635
Something you understand, too,
Thomas Magnum.

47:27.437 --> 47:29.268
At least you've done
one good thing today.

47:29.339 --> 47:31.273
You've saved Jack's life.

47:31.474 --> 47:33.066
Congratulations.

48:07.544 --> 48:10.445
<i>Illusion and reality</i>
<i>finally came together.</i>

48:10.513 --> 48:13.311
<i>And like I always knew,</i>
<i>deep down inside,</i>

48:13.383 --> 48:15.908
<i>illusion never</i>
<i>really had a chance.</i>
