Previously on Van Helsing...

00:02.654 --> 00:03.742
Vanessa!

00:03.786 --> 00:05.788
I need to make sure
you live!

00:05.831 --> 00:06.615
What?!

00:06.658 --> 00:07.398
You're my sister!

00:07.442 --> 00:08.791
I love you!

00:08.834 --> 00:11.098
If you love me then come back!

00:11.141 --> 00:13.709
I have to do this on my own.

00:16.494 --> 00:17.887
Sam.

00:17.930 --> 00:19.236
Go find him.

00:19.280 --> 00:20.933
You don't need me now.

00:20.977 --> 00:22.761
You can do it on your own.

02:09.216 --> 02:10.826
I've seen you before.

02:16.136 --> 02:19.530
In the beginning.

02:19.574 --> 02:21.184
When I was a kid.

02:21.228 --> 02:24.100
When your rage first began.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.580
You get a kick out of that?

02:25.623 --> 02:27.147
Scaring little kids?

02:27.190 --> 02:31.063
I come to those
who show promise.

02:31.107 --> 02:32.761
Promise of what?

02:32.804 --> 02:38.070
I think you know
deep inside you.

02:38.114 --> 02:39.898
Who are you really
and what do you want?

02:39.942 --> 02:41.204
I'm a seer.

02:41.248 --> 02:42.684
A messenger.

02:42.727 --> 02:45.077
A caller to the chosen.

02:45.121 --> 02:47.297
You look like an elder to me.

02:47.341 --> 02:48.516
Or worse.

02:48.559 --> 02:54.478
You threaten me with
your blade of steel.

02:54.522 --> 02:59.614
You cannot destroy
that which you harbour.

02:59.657 --> 03:01.442
And what's that?

03:01.485 --> 03:04.532
Your seed of thirst.

03:04.575 --> 03:06.403
Anger.

03:06.447 --> 03:08.100
Rage.

03:08.144 --> 03:11.191
Now the seed has taken root.

03:11.234 --> 03:14.672
Fed by the blood of a sacrifice.

03:14.716 --> 03:16.631
What sacrifice?

03:16.674 --> 03:21.940
You drank blood before but now,
now you have killed for it.

03:26.728 --> 03:29.209
Savoured it.

03:29.252 --> 03:31.994
That runs inside you.

03:33.909 --> 03:36.216
It won't happen again.

03:36.259 --> 03:41.177
You say no but the blood
burrows deeper.

03:41.221 --> 03:43.005
Feeds the seed.

03:43.048 --> 03:44.398
I can control it.

03:44.441 --> 03:45.790
Yes.

03:45.834 --> 03:47.488
Perhaps.

03:47.531 --> 03:49.664
But why?

03:49.707 --> 03:53.929
Nurture the darkness
and you will find yourself.

03:53.972 --> 03:56.497
I'm a Van Helsing.

03:56.540 --> 03:57.759
That's who I am.

03:57.802 --> 03:59.630
Be who you really are.

03:59.674 --> 04:04.287
Spawn of the darkness,
holder of its blood.

04:04.331 --> 04:08.857
And I will find that last totem
and I will raise the dark one.

04:08.900 --> 04:10.380
Yes.

04:10.424 --> 04:12.556
Release him.

04:12.600 --> 04:17.169
And then I will carve out
his heart and leave it to rot.

04:17.213 --> 04:18.954
But will you?

04:18.997 --> 04:20.999
Can you now?

04:29.617 --> 04:33.664
Do you have the light left
to fight the dark?

04:33.708 --> 04:37.102
One act of good
can tip the scales,

04:37.146 --> 04:38.713
or topple them.

04:38.756 --> 04:41.324
If you have something
to say, say it.

04:41.368 --> 04:44.458
I see your path.

04:44.501 --> 04:47.243
It's not straight.

04:47.287 --> 04:50.028
Nor clear.

04:50.072 --> 04:52.640
Hangs in the balance.

04:52.683 --> 04:54.468
Hangs.

04:54.511 --> 04:57.340
It hangs.

04:57.384 --> 04:59.995
And it begins.

05:36.466 --> 05:37.467
Hey.

05:39.687 --> 05:41.079
Don't move.

05:41.123 --> 05:43.212
I'll make this quick
and painless.

05:51.699 --> 05:52.700
Mohamad?

05:57.182 --> 06:01.535
Mohamad, it's- it's me.
Vanessa.

06:03.406 --> 06:06.235
I'm not gonna hurt you.

06:06.278 --> 06:08.237
It's me.

06:08.280 --> 06:09.891
You know me.

06:24.819 --> 06:25.950
Vanessa.

06:25.994 --> 06:28.388
Yeah.

06:28.431 --> 06:30.825
I thought you were dead.

06:33.175 --> 06:35.395
I can help you.

06:35.438 --> 06:36.918
I can try to turn you.

06:42.097 --> 06:43.098
Mohamad!

06:46.884 --> 06:48.146
Mohamad!

06:56.807 --> 06:57.982
Mohamad!

07:01.725 --> 07:02.944
Mohamad!

07:10.995 --> 07:12.344
Mohamad!

07:22.354 --> 07:23.747
Mohamad!

07:26.576 --> 07:28.273
I'm just trying
to help you.

07:32.277 --> 07:34.062
Stay still!

07:34.105 --> 07:35.803
I need to bite you.

07:35.846 --> 07:36.630
No.

07:36.673 --> 07:38.675
Listen to me.

07:38.719 --> 07:41.373
Stay down!

07:41.765 --> 07:43.332
Stay back!

07:49.730 --> 07:52.384
Ok, you wanna do this
the hard way.

07:54.822 --> 07:56.563
Shit.

08:08.531 --> 08:10.490
You're not getting away
that easy.

08:17.845 --> 08:19.368
Just stay still!

08:20.195 --> 08:21.413
Stay back!

08:24.982 --> 08:26.854
I don't have time
for this bullshit!

11:22.464 --> 11:24.118
Wendy says hi.

11:25.772 --> 11:27.121
John?

11:27.164 --> 11:31.516
But I guess you never really
met Wendy, did you?

11:31.560 --> 11:33.127
Watching her get murdered
by that marine

11:33.170 --> 11:37.174
doesn't really count I guess.

11:37.218 --> 11:39.176
You're dead, I killed you.

11:39.220 --> 11:42.658
Believe me, I remember.

11:42.702 --> 11:47.663
Well, you got yourself
in a bit of trouble there.

11:47.707 --> 11:51.275
That's gonna leave
a mark.

11:51.319 --> 11:54.148
Must feel strange,
stuck like that.

11:54.191 --> 11:57.238
Weak, helpless.

11:57.281 --> 12:01.242
Sorta like you're human.

12:01.285 --> 12:02.634
I am human.

12:02.678 --> 12:05.812
You think?

12:05.855 --> 12:08.945
And I think maybe that uh,

12:08.989 --> 12:10.642
I think maybe
that hook must have

12:10.686 --> 12:12.688
nicked your heart.

12:12.732 --> 12:16.039
Maybe your heart doesn't heal up
like the rest of you does.

12:16.083 --> 12:19.042
Makes a lot of sense
if you ask me.

12:19.086 --> 12:23.568
Anyway, I guess I can't
really blame you

12:23.612 --> 12:26.789
for what that asshole Axel did,

12:26.833 --> 12:28.704
not letting me out to look
for my wife.

12:28.748 --> 12:36.190
He didn't try to help, just
shooting her in the head.

12:36.233 --> 12:37.931
It was his decision not mine.

12:37.974 --> 12:41.848
Still, it's not like you helped.

12:41.891 --> 12:45.416
I cut her down.

12:45.460 --> 12:47.810
I carried her to you
so you could say goodbye.

12:47.854 --> 12:52.206
You didn't hand yourself
over to Julius's thugs, right?

12:52.249 --> 12:55.731
All they wanted was you.

12:55.775 --> 12:56.993
I tried.

12:57.037 --> 12:58.952
You stopped me, remember?

12:58.995 --> 13:00.649
Right.

13:00.692 --> 13:02.085
You let G.I. Joe run rampant

13:02.129 --> 13:04.696
'cause all you gave a shit about
was who you loved.

13:04.740 --> 13:05.828
Who you'd lost.

13:05.872 --> 13:09.701
I- I understand that.

13:09.745 --> 13:11.312
What do you want?

13:11.355 --> 13:12.879
Maybe you should ask yourself
that 'cause I'm pretty sure

13:12.922 --> 13:16.012
I'm just a figment of your
crumbling psyche or whatever.

13:16.056 --> 13:19.015
A manifestation of guilt,
maybe.

13:19.059 --> 13:22.062
Of shame.

13:22.105 --> 13:24.368
The witch sent you.

13:24.412 --> 13:25.674
Who knows?

13:25.717 --> 13:27.110
Maybe.

13:27.154 --> 13:32.812
I gotta tell you, all bets
are off then, right?

13:32.855 --> 13:34.857
'Cause I could be capable
of anything.

13:34.901 --> 13:38.121
Helping you, hurting you,

13:38.165 --> 13:42.604
wreaking a little revenge,
maybe... Huh?

13:42.647 --> 13:44.911
Go on.

13:44.954 --> 13:47.739
Try it.

13:51.482 --> 13:52.832
Nah.

13:53.702 --> 13:55.312
Nah.

13:55.356 --> 13:57.358
I think I'll pass for now.

13:57.401 --> 14:02.102
Maybe just let the strength
leak out of you a bit more.

14:02.145 --> 14:05.888
Always such a gentleman,
John.

14:07.977 --> 14:11.459
Still bleeding, huh?

14:11.502 --> 14:15.811
I wonder if something like this
could actually kill you.

14:15.855 --> 14:18.118
Even vampires die, right?

14:18.161 --> 14:19.641
I'm not a vampire, asshole.

14:19.684 --> 14:20.685
Yeah, sure.

14:20.729 --> 14:23.036
Just keep telling yourself that.

14:23.079 --> 14:24.994
You know what I really
wanna know?

14:25.038 --> 14:28.128
The real reason I'm here?

14:28.171 --> 14:31.174
Why you murdered me
in cold blood.

14:31.218 --> 14:33.437
Huh?

14:33.481 --> 14:35.526
I thought you were the killer.

14:35.570 --> 14:37.137
Everyone did.

14:37.180 --> 14:40.618
You thought I strung up that
girl Cynthia in the stairwell?

14:40.662 --> 14:44.057
You thought I stabbed whoever
that guy was Doc was working on?

14:44.100 --> 14:45.797
You thought I cut off
their fingers,

14:45.841 --> 14:47.495
stuffed them in my pack?

14:47.538 --> 14:48.931
Bullshit!

14:48.975 --> 14:50.019
Yeah? You didn't exactly have
a glowing reputation

14:50.063 --> 14:52.239
at the time, John.

14:52.282 --> 14:54.328
Attempted rape?

14:54.371 --> 14:56.069
It can give people
the wrong impression.

14:56.112 --> 14:58.245
It wasn't attempted anything!

14:58.288 --> 15:01.857
I kissed her, she kissed
me back!

15:04.207 --> 15:05.600
Then she pulled away.

15:05.643 --> 15:08.646
I tried to stop her
and she screamed, ok?

15:08.690 --> 15:09.778
I panicked.

15:09.821 --> 15:12.302
I choked her a little
to shut her up.

15:12.346 --> 15:14.957
So what?

15:15.001 --> 15:18.482
You really have no idea
what an asshole you are.

15:18.526 --> 15:21.964
Panicking isn't
a capitol offence.

15:22.008 --> 15:23.705
I was drunk.

15:23.748 --> 15:26.273
We all were, remember?

15:26.316 --> 15:30.320
Oh...

15:30.364 --> 15:35.891
So that means you can just
get away with anything?

15:35.935 --> 15:39.547
You sound like every guy
I've ever met.

15:39.590 --> 15:45.031
You just think any excuse
is ok.

15:45.074 --> 15:48.077
That's the reason you jammed
a knife in my throat.

15:48.121 --> 15:51.907
You never bought I was
a killer, not really.

15:51.951 --> 15:55.955
Not totally.

15:55.998 --> 15:57.130
You know what I think?

15:57.173 --> 15:59.349
I don't give a shit, John.

15:59.393 --> 16:02.004
Oh, what am I doing here then?

16:02.048 --> 16:04.311
'Cause I'm really leaning
towards the manifestation

16:04.354 --> 16:06.835
of your guilt angle.

16:06.878 --> 16:09.011
Really?

16:09.055 --> 16:10.970
Huh.

16:11.013 --> 16:19.456
'Cause I don't really
feel guilty, John.

16:19.500 --> 16:22.416
I wanted to do it.

16:22.459 --> 16:27.856
In fact, I enjoyed it.

16:27.899 --> 16:29.684
And I'd do it again.

16:29.727 --> 16:32.078
I have no doubt.

16:32.121 --> 16:34.297
None.

16:34.341 --> 16:35.820
'Cause I know when you dig

16:35.864 --> 16:38.606
past all that stuff
about saving humanity,

16:38.649 --> 16:41.478
doing your best in bad times
and all that crap,

16:41.522 --> 16:49.921
deep down in you it's just black
right at the core.

16:49.965 --> 16:52.489
And I think you know that,
too.

17:41.973 --> 17:43.105
Let it out.

17:43.149 --> 17:44.976
It might help, you know.

17:52.984 --> 17:53.985
Hey, tough guy.

17:54.029 --> 17:55.335
How's it hangin'?

17:57.902 --> 18:00.557
Sorry, I couldn't resist.

18:00.601 --> 18:01.602
Julius.

18:05.954 --> 18:07.216
It's good to see you.

18:07.260 --> 18:09.610
Wow, this kinda sucks, huh?

18:09.653 --> 18:11.829
Yeah, a little bit.

18:11.873 --> 18:13.483
Listen, that guy
from before?

18:13.527 --> 18:14.789
The guy you were
talking to?

18:14.832 --> 18:16.921
I don't know who he is
or what his problem is

18:16.965 --> 18:21.535
but you were bang on
on the asshole part.

18:21.578 --> 18:24.190
Well, I did kill him.

18:24.233 --> 18:26.192
And he deserved it.

18:30.805 --> 18:31.893
But there are others.

18:31.936 --> 18:32.937
Come on.

18:32.981 --> 18:34.504
Who do you think
you're talking to?

18:34.548 --> 18:36.115
If there's anyone that has
to live with the things

18:36.158 --> 18:38.856
that they have done
it's this guy.

18:38.900 --> 18:41.859
It's different.
You were turned.

18:41.903 --> 18:42.860
It's not your fault.

18:42.904 --> 18:44.427
Isn't it?

18:44.471 --> 18:47.169
I have done a lot of things
before as a human

18:47.213 --> 18:48.649
that I am not proud of.

18:48.692 --> 18:51.478
I know you, Julius.

18:51.521 --> 18:53.132
You're good to the core.

18:53.175 --> 18:56.483
And so are you.

18:56.526 --> 18:58.093
I'm not so sure anymore.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.660
I am.

19:01.401 --> 19:03.054
What the hell was that?

19:04.317 --> 19:06.884
I don't know but I think my time
here is almost up.

19:09.104 --> 19:12.673
Listen, you saved me.

19:12.716 --> 19:16.459
You saved a lot of people
and I know in my heart

19:16.503 --> 19:20.942
that you're gonna get out
of this and save us all.

19:20.985 --> 19:22.509
I don't know.

19:22.552 --> 19:25.207
You do know that.

19:25.251 --> 19:31.213
I believe in you and I know
you believe in your heart.

19:31.257 --> 19:34.434
Believe in your heart,
Vanessa.

19:34.477 --> 19:37.045
If you've still got one.

20:04.812 --> 20:07.293
What is at your core,
Vanessa?

20:07.336 --> 20:09.773
Nothing as rotten as yours.

20:11.949 --> 20:18.956
So much delicious blood
poured out of you.

20:23.483 --> 20:28.488
Such a waste.

20:28.531 --> 20:30.272
Help yourself.

20:30.316 --> 20:32.927
A change might
do you good.

20:32.970 --> 20:38.889
You know all about
blood now.

20:38.933 --> 20:41.283
How it eats at you,

20:44.330 --> 20:47.158
and wanting in your belly.

20:50.292 --> 20:52.990
Coursing through you.

20:53.034 --> 20:54.035
Ah!

20:55.428 --> 21:00.563
How it makes you vibrate
with life.

21:00.607 --> 21:03.523
You'll never shake the need.

21:03.566 --> 21:08.615
It's in you and you know it.

21:08.658 --> 21:11.618
Dig deep.
It's there.

21:11.661 --> 21:13.359
The hunger.

21:13.402 --> 21:16.623
More craving.

21:16.666 --> 21:19.800
More lust.

21:19.843 --> 21:23.194
I've lost the taste
for it myself.

21:26.502 --> 21:29.331
You and I are the same.

21:32.987 --> 21:37.557
We are both killers by nature.

21:38.949 --> 21:40.777
John.

21:40.821 --> 21:45.347
Before that, his wife.

21:45.391 --> 21:48.002
You can still hear the screams,
can't you?

21:48.045 --> 21:50.352
Don't blame your murders
on me.

21:50.396 --> 21:53.486
How much blood is on your hands,
Vanessa?

21:53.529 --> 21:55.923
Not as much as yours.

21:55.966 --> 21:57.751
Yeah.

21:57.794 --> 21:59.709
Yes, that we know of.

21:59.753 --> 22:03.496
That we know.

22:03.539 --> 22:05.236
But your last one...

22:16.335 --> 22:25.605
Your last one, that one put you
on the right track.

22:25.648 --> 22:29.043
Give in, Vanessa.

22:29.086 --> 22:31.480
Give in.

22:33.134 --> 22:37.399
I'd rather hang here and rot.

22:37.443 --> 22:41.403
And that you will.

22:41.447 --> 22:44.406
You have always been one
to suffer.

22:44.450 --> 22:48.541
You love to suffer.

22:48.584 --> 22:52.675
You could have saved
your daughter, but no.

22:52.719 --> 22:55.678
You love the pain
too much.

22:55.722 --> 22:58.377
I did everything I could.

22:58.420 --> 22:59.943
That's a lie.

23:02.468 --> 23:05.427
Dylan.

23:05.471 --> 23:08.169
Why didn't you feed me,
mom?

23:08.212 --> 23:10.606
All I needed was blood.

23:10.650 --> 23:12.826
What kind of mother
are you?

23:12.869 --> 23:15.437
You won't hunt
for your own.

23:15.481 --> 23:17.134
Dylan I tried.

23:17.178 --> 23:19.136
No you didn't.

23:19.180 --> 23:21.704
I'm sorry.

23:21.748 --> 23:23.010
I'm so sorry.

23:23.053 --> 23:24.533
You can still join her.

23:24.577 --> 23:25.969
Be with her.

23:26.013 --> 23:28.929
You know what you have
to do.

23:28.972 --> 23:29.973
Dylan.

23:32.498 --> 23:33.803
Dylan!

23:36.545 --> 23:38.286
The darkness is calling.

23:38.329 --> 23:39.679
Feel the relief.

23:39.722 --> 23:42.595
Dylan! Dylan!

23:42.638 --> 23:44.510
Everything that you've lost
can be yours again.

23:44.553 --> 23:46.990
Get away from me!

23:49.079 --> 23:50.472

I have to admit,

24:59.541 --> 25:04.546
I fed on a couple dogs back
in my vampire days but bats?

25:11.031 --> 25:13.207
Is it really you this time?

25:13.250 --> 25:16.079
Who else would I be,
hmm?

25:16.123 --> 25:18.604
I am who I am.

25:18.647 --> 25:20.257
Just like you.

25:20.301 --> 25:22.564
I don't know who
that is anymore.

25:22.608 --> 25:24.914
Yes you do.

25:28.831 --> 25:32.356
I killed a man for blood.

25:32.400 --> 25:36.012
You should feel shitty
about that.

25:36.056 --> 25:39.799
But you can't let that get
in the way of who you are

25:39.842 --> 25:44.107
and what you have to do.

25:44.151 --> 25:47.241
You're stronger than that.

25:47.284 --> 25:49.025
I don't know about that.

25:49.069 --> 25:52.986
Yeah you do.

25:53.029 --> 25:59.166
And you have to dig deep
right now and know it, too.

25:59.209 --> 26:02.648
It's the only way out.

26:02.691 --> 26:04.388
You're so sure.

26:04.432 --> 26:05.868
Mmmhmm.

26:05.912 --> 26:08.218
I know you.

26:08.262 --> 26:10.612
I love you.

26:10.656 --> 26:14.703
And love always wins.

26:17.924 --> 26:19.273
Liar.

26:23.233 --> 26:25.192
She lies.

26:25.235 --> 26:26.497
Get away from her.

26:26.541 --> 26:29.718
No. No.

26:29.762 --> 26:30.850
No.

26:30.893 --> 26:33.026
Don't hurt her.

26:33.069 --> 26:35.115
I already did.

26:35.158 --> 26:38.945
Shouldn't I again?

26:38.988 --> 26:41.556
Why did you do these things,
Sam?

26:41.600 --> 26:44.820
I killed Susan because
she was weak.

26:44.864 --> 26:47.606
Because she was suffering.

26:47.649 --> 26:48.563
That's not true.

26:48.607 --> 26:49.433
Yes.

26:49.477 --> 26:52.306
She was so strong.

26:52.349 --> 26:53.786
No.

26:53.829 --> 26:58.965
She was filled with pain,
just like the others.

26:59.008 --> 27:03.056
She was in the way
of the strong.

27:03.099 --> 27:05.885
I killed her to clear the way.

27:05.928 --> 27:12.718
You killed her because
you're a sick piece of shit.

27:15.895 --> 27:17.592
See?

27:17.636 --> 27:19.986
See her cower.

27:20.029 --> 27:21.030
See the truth.

27:21.074 --> 27:22.466
She's like most
of humanity.

27:22.510 --> 27:23.685
Pathetic.

27:23.729 --> 27:25.078
Undisciplined.

27:25.121 --> 27:26.209
I'm better than that.

27:26.253 --> 27:27.907
I am more.

27:27.950 --> 27:30.257
Don't listen to him, Vanessa.

27:30.300 --> 27:31.214
Shut him out.

27:31.258 --> 27:36.045
I'm not sick or crazy or psycho.

27:36.089 --> 27:38.831
I understand life.

27:38.874 --> 27:42.573
I see the truth.

27:42.617 --> 27:44.401
You're a monster.

27:44.445 --> 27:45.794
Me?

27:45.838 --> 27:47.361
Aren't you a monster?

27:47.404 --> 27:49.406
Don't let him get
into your head.

27:49.450 --> 27:54.890
Why did you not kill me
in those woods?

27:54.934 --> 27:59.852
Why did you cripple me
and leave me there instead?

27:59.895 --> 28:03.856
Because I wanted you
to suffer, Sam.

28:03.899 --> 28:10.253
I wanted you to suffer
for killing all those people.

28:10.297 --> 28:11.646
For killing Susan.

28:11.690 --> 28:15.215
Hmm.

28:15.258 --> 28:17.173
You deserve to suffer.

28:17.217 --> 28:18.479
See?

28:18.522 --> 28:20.481
I kill out of compassion.

28:20.524 --> 28:22.875
I put the weak out
of their misery.

28:22.918 --> 28:24.137
That's bullshit.

28:24.180 --> 28:31.797
You maimed me to inflict
pain and suffering.

28:31.840 --> 28:32.798
You did that.

28:32.841 --> 28:34.582
And you don't?

28:34.625 --> 28:35.975
What about Felix?

28:36.018 --> 28:40.414
What about that sick torture
you put him through?

28:40.457 --> 28:44.940
I gave him the opportunity
to grow and he did.

28:44.984 --> 28:46.812
He became better.

28:46.855 --> 28:48.204
God, you really believe that?

28:48.248 --> 28:50.816
Don't you?

28:50.859 --> 29:00.086
Late at night and alone, aren't
you drawn to become better?

29:00.129 --> 29:05.918
To rise above these
feeble humans,

29:05.961 --> 29:12.185
when the voice of truth whispers
in your ear...

29:12.228 --> 29:17.799
it is time.

29:17.843 --> 29:24.806
You are the darkness.

29:24.850 --> 29:26.808
Don't let him in.

29:26.852 --> 29:28.679
Silence!!!

29:28.723 --> 29:30.420
The humans have lost.

29:30.464 --> 29:32.814
The world is no longer theirs.

29:32.858 --> 29:34.642
They deserve to lose.

29:34.685 --> 29:37.776
Vicious, ignorant beasts.

29:37.819 --> 29:39.125
You should know.

29:39.168 --> 29:41.562
So should you.

29:41.605 --> 29:47.002
You kill for blood.

30:06.108 --> 30:08.415
I was weak.

30:08.458 --> 30:09.895
I gave in.

30:09.938 --> 30:11.461
I own that.

30:11.505 --> 30:15.857
Oh, you did not succumb.

30:15.901 --> 30:23.125
You emerged.

30:23.169 --> 30:25.998
You saw the truth.

30:26.041 --> 30:29.523
The truth of life.

30:29.566 --> 30:33.527
The truth inside you.

30:33.570 --> 30:34.658
No.

30:34.702 --> 30:37.661
You did not falter.

30:37.705 --> 30:41.404
You thrived.

30:41.448 --> 30:43.102
Don't listen to him,
Vanessa.

30:43.145 --> 30:46.366
You will save us all.

30:46.409 --> 30:47.976
Enough.

30:52.024 --> 30:53.025
Leave her alone!

30:53.068 --> 30:56.289
She's nothing, you know that.

30:56.332 --> 31:01.555
You always wanted to drink
from her.

31:02.295 --> 31:04.253
No. Susan.

31:04.297 --> 31:06.429
From the very start.

31:06.473 --> 31:08.301
Don't hurt her, Sam!

31:10.172 --> 31:13.610
That was your real craving.

31:13.654 --> 31:17.963
Ahhhh!!! Sam!

31:18.006 --> 31:24.273
You need more time...
to reflect.

31:24.317 --> 31:26.014
Susan!

31:26.710 --> 31:30.801
See who you really are!

32:07.273 --> 32:09.797
She was right.

32:09.840 --> 32:11.712
Shut him out.

32:15.368 --> 32:17.500
Dylan.

32:17.544 --> 32:21.200
You need to save your strength
for the real fight.

32:21.243 --> 32:22.897
Look at you.

32:26.422 --> 32:27.858
You've grown.

32:35.649 --> 32:40.828
You're so beautiful.

32:40.871 --> 32:42.917
I miss you.

32:42.961 --> 32:45.311
I never really left.

32:45.354 --> 32:48.140
I'm always with you.

32:48.183 --> 32:50.664
No one ever really leaves.

32:50.707 --> 32:53.275
You taught me that.

32:55.364 --> 32:57.540
It's ok, mom.

32:57.584 --> 33:03.851
Everyone dies, even me.

33:03.894 --> 33:07.246
I should have tried harder.

33:07.289 --> 33:10.989
I'm so sorry.

33:11.032 --> 33:13.121
I should have done more
to keep you alive.

33:13.165 --> 33:15.558
It wasn't your fault.

33:15.602 --> 33:19.910
You tried your best to save me
and it didn't work.

33:19.954 --> 33:23.914
That took a lot of courage.

33:23.958 --> 33:29.268
Look, I know there's darkness
in you.

33:29.311 --> 33:33.185
It's been true since
before all this.

33:33.228 --> 33:37.232
But you can do anything,
mom.

33:37.276 --> 33:39.408
Nothing can stop you.

33:39.452 --> 33:40.975
You're unstoppable.

33:41.019 --> 33:42.585
I hope you're right.

33:42.629 --> 33:44.065
I'm always right.

33:51.377 --> 33:52.987
Look.

33:53.031 --> 33:56.121
Look what you have.

33:56.164 --> 33:59.428
Keep it.

33:59.472 --> 34:01.213
You'll need it.

34:06.218 --> 34:09.743
You know what you have
to do now.

34:09.786 --> 34:11.875
Vanessa.

34:17.359 --> 34:20.101
You have to change him.

34:20.145 --> 34:21.581
Yes.

34:22.973 --> 34:24.366
Don't go.

34:26.890 --> 34:29.197
Use what you have left of me.

34:29.241 --> 34:32.374
The light you have inside.

34:32.418 --> 34:34.420
You'll find a way.

34:43.168 --> 34:47.041
Vanessa!

34:47.085 --> 34:48.825
You want a piece of me?

34:52.394 --> 34:54.309
Come to mama.

34:58.270 --> 34:59.401
Come on.

34:59.445 --> 35:01.403
Yes.

35:01.447 --> 35:03.057
I know you're hungry,
Mohamad.

35:03.101 --> 35:04.624
Come on.

35:07.235 --> 35:09.019
Come on.

35:10.804 --> 35:12.458
Come on.

35:14.982 --> 35:17.680
Come on, Mohamad.

35:17.724 --> 35:19.900
Aren't you hungry?

35:19.943 --> 35:21.380
Yeah, you're hungry.

35:21.423 --> 35:23.338
Come on.

35:23.382 --> 35:24.948
Come on.

35:24.992 --> 35:26.559
Keep coming.

35:26.602 --> 35:28.604
Come on, Mohamad.

35:34.088 --> 35:36.656
Keep coming.
That's right.

35:36.699 --> 35:38.179
That's right.

35:38.223 --> 35:40.181
Yep.

35:40.225 --> 35:42.966
Come on.

35:43.010 --> 35:44.620
Come to mama.

35:47.232 --> 35:48.668
That's right.

35:48.711 --> 35:50.670
You're almost there.

35:50.713 --> 35:53.325
Yeah, come on.

35:53.368 --> 35:54.369
Come on.

36:05.641 --> 36:07.469
Come on.

36:07.513 --> 36:08.862
Yeah.

36:08.905 --> 36:10.516
Does that smell good?

36:10.559 --> 36:12.387
Yeah, come on.

36:12.431 --> 36:15.216
Come on, baby.

36:38.848 --> 36:40.110
Come on.

36:43.288 --> 36:45.115
Come on.

36:48.684 --> 36:50.686
Mohamad, come on.

37:28.115 --> 37:30.596
Vanessa?

37:30.639 --> 37:33.076
Oh my god, what happened
to you?

37:33.120 --> 37:34.469
You have to get me
off this thing.

37:34.513 --> 37:35.296
The chair.

37:35.340 --> 37:38.168
Get the chair, the chair!

37:44.305 --> 37:45.306
Oh, Jesus.

37:45.350 --> 37:46.829
I've healed around
the hook.

37:46.873 --> 37:47.874
You have to help me.

37:47.917 --> 37:48.657
Ok, ready?

37:48.701 --> 37:50.398
Yeah.

37:50.442 --> 37:53.314
Ahhhh!!!!!!

38:00.800 --> 38:03.106
You have to-
you have to feed.

38:03.150 --> 38:04.586
No.

38:04.630 --> 38:07.328
You don't really have that much
of a choice, Vanessa.

38:07.372 --> 38:08.808
You're gonna die
if you don't feed,

38:08.851 --> 38:10.288
you know that, right?

38:10.331 --> 38:11.680
Take some blood, here.

38:11.724 --> 38:15.597
No. Not anymore.

38:15.641 --> 38:18.078
Just get me outta here.

38:18.121 --> 38:20.123
Ok.

38:20.167 --> 38:22.169
Alright, let's go.

38:26.129 --> 38:27.566
There we go.

38:45.192 --> 38:46.236
I need to sit.

38:46.280 --> 38:46.802
Ok.

38:46.846 --> 38:47.499
Yeah.

38:47.542 --> 38:49.327
Slowly.

38:49.370 --> 38:50.284
There you go.

38:50.328 --> 38:52.155
There you go.

38:55.071 --> 38:57.552
You ok?

38:57.596 --> 39:01.861
Yeah.

39:01.904 --> 39:03.471
Ok. I'll get you better.

39:06.039 --> 39:08.258
Maybe get some food?

39:08.302 --> 39:09.390
Some water?

39:09.434 --> 39:11.436
Yeah, in a bit.

39:15.440 --> 39:16.702
Ok.

39:16.745 --> 39:19.705
You're ok.

39:19.748 --> 39:23.186
Yeah. We're ok.

39:25.188 --> 39:26.189
You sure you're ok?

39:26.233 --> 39:28.061
You don't wanna rest up
for a bit?

39:28.104 --> 39:29.497
I mean, I could use the rest,
too.

39:29.541 --> 39:31.586
I'm fine.

39:31.630 --> 39:34.154
Thank you.

39:34.197 --> 39:37.810
You're welcome.

39:37.853 --> 39:39.855
So when were you turned?

39:39.899 --> 39:41.596
Back in that field
where I left you?

39:41.640 --> 39:44.730
Nah, it was way after that.

39:44.773 --> 39:48.690
Flesh saved me and...
I got taken after that.

39:48.734 --> 39:50.866
Taken, by who?

39:50.910 --> 39:53.216
By Sam.

39:53.260 --> 39:54.043
Sam.

39:54.087 --> 39:55.741
Yeah.

39:55.784 --> 39:57.525
So he's still alive.

39:57.569 --> 39:58.526
Yes, he is.

39:58.570 --> 40:00.833
He bit me and left me to die.

40:00.876 --> 40:02.400
Why?

40:02.443 --> 40:05.664
Because I didn't want to be
whatever he wanted me to be.

40:05.707 --> 40:07.579
So he switched me out
for another kid

40:07.622 --> 40:09.494
and left me in a bunker.

40:09.537 --> 40:11.583
Felix.

40:11.626 --> 40:13.976
I got out and got away.

40:14.020 --> 40:18.633
I really don't remember much
but I remember hunting,

40:18.677 --> 40:21.375
feeding...

40:21.419 --> 40:23.203
I- I really don't
wanna remember.

40:23.246 --> 40:25.684
Yeah, don't.

40:25.727 --> 40:28.643
You're back.

40:28.687 --> 40:30.471
Yes, we are.

40:30.515 --> 40:32.995
Back together again
and back on the road.

40:33.039 --> 40:37.609
Oh, Mohamad, you-
you can't come with me.

40:37.652 --> 40:39.001
The hell I can't.

40:39.045 --> 40:40.699
Not where I'm going, ok?

40:40.742 --> 40:41.787
It's too dangerous.

40:41.830 --> 40:43.876
Wherever you go I go,
too.

40:43.919 --> 40:46.226
Not this time.

40:46.269 --> 40:47.880
Ok, look.

40:47.923 --> 40:50.709
I need to know that I at least
saved one person in all this.

40:50.752 --> 40:53.494
So after everything I've done

40:53.538 --> 40:56.018
you wanna make sure
that I am safe?

40:58.238 --> 40:59.413
I know that everything
you did

40:59.457 --> 41:01.459
you did out of love
for your sister.

41:01.502 --> 41:03.635
And I get that.

41:03.678 --> 41:06.942
Turns out I have a sister, too.

41:06.986 --> 41:08.466
Wait, what? Seriously?

41:08.509 --> 41:10.337
Yeah.

41:10.380 --> 41:12.121
Damn.

41:12.165 --> 41:15.168
This is a crazy ass world
we live in.

41:15.211 --> 41:18.606
I saw some people camping out
over there in the woods.

41:18.650 --> 41:19.607
Find them.

41:19.651 --> 41:22.567
Take care of them.

41:22.610 --> 41:25.221
Do it for me.

41:33.099 --> 41:35.318
Don't follow me.

41:35.362 --> 41:37.277
Promise.

41:37.320 --> 41:41.281
I promise.

41:41.324 --> 41:43.675
'Cause I will kick your ass
if you do.

41:43.718 --> 41:45.720
Yes ma'am.

41:51.813 --> 41:54.337
I mean it.

41:54.381 --> 41:55.600
Stay alive.

41:55.643 --> 41:59.560
You too.

42:20.233 --> 42:23.323
As if I'd leave you
on your own.
