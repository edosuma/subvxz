WEBVTT

00:03.036 --> 00:05.503
Hey, good morning, Lou.
Looks that way.

00:05.538 --> 00:08.506
Hey, do anything fun last night?
Yeah, I had a date with my girl.

00:08.541 --> 00:12.879
-Ooh, the gigantic vet?
-Well, you never met her. How do you know she's gigantic?

00:13.380 --> 00:14.881
Well, I was on the way
to work today,

00:15.382 --> 00:17.384
and I saw her swatting planes away
from the Empire State Building.

00:17.419 --> 00:20.387
Well, I'm gonna have her here
soon. You'll see. She's hot.

00:20.422 --> 00:22.187
Oh, good.
Thanks for the update.

00:22.222 --> 00:26.226
We'll reinforce the floors and
raise the ceiling five feet.

00:26.261 --> 00:28.228
Hey, boys, what's goin' on?
Hi, guys.

00:28.263 --> 00:30.028
Hey.
You remember Heather.

00:30.063 --> 00:33.400
- Yeah.
- How's it goin'? You find another place to live yet?

00:33.435 --> 00:35.367
The place that burned,
that was my friend's place.

00:35.402 --> 00:37.969
- I'm staying with another friend downtown.
-Well, for now.

00:38.004 --> 00:41.741
That situation might change if
things go this well, right, babe?

00:41.776 --> 00:43.743
That's right, cookie.

00:44.144 --> 00:46.978
Yep.
My cream just curdled.

00:47.013 --> 00:50.583
-He's gonna show me his locker.
- Yeah. I'm gonna show her my locker.

00:50.618 --> 00:52.919
- Okay.
-You ready?

00:53.153 --> 00:58.024
I'm ready, Mr. Perfectly Hairy
Chest. Don't-Don't do that.

01:03.263 --> 01:08.268
Did I miss somethin'? Just another
episode of When Geeks Collide.

01:08.303 --> 01:10.235
Here.
What's that?

01:10.270 --> 01:12.570
Some doughnuts.
Peace offering.

01:12.605 --> 01:14.607
Just put a little button on our
situation, and we'll move on.

01:14.642 --> 01:17.777
Why don't we forget the button,
and you move on?

01:18.011 --> 01:20.563
Yeah. You're a real charmer.

01:20.598 --> 01:23.116
No wonder your wife left you.

01:26.352 --> 01:28.388
She got you.
Yeah, she got me.

01:28.888 --> 01:31.891
Get your hands off of those,
asshole, all right? Those are mine.

01:35.795 --> 01:38.263
Ah! No jelly.
Bitch.

01:38.298 --> 01:41.099
How-- Hey, guys.
What's goin'--

01:41.134 --> 01:43.601
Hey, what have we got here?
Hallelujah.

01:43.636 --> 01:46.906
Looks like it's not gonna be a shitty
day after all. Trouble with the wife?

01:46.941 --> 01:49.976
No, everything's okay on
that account. No jellies.

01:50.210 --> 01:52.110
Son of a bitch.

01:52.145 --> 01:55.248
The son is down to give me a hand for
a couple of weeks. Oh, your gay son?

01:57.817 --> 02:01.320
You had to go there with that?
Was that absolutely necessary?

02:01.355 --> 02:04.824
When people ask me about you,
do I say, "The retarded probie"?

02:04.859 --> 02:06.993
No. I just say,
"The probie."

02:07.227 --> 02:10.096
He's my son.
Just my son.

02:10.395 --> 02:12.397
Sorry.
Stay where you are.

02:12.432 --> 02:14.434
McManus is out front looking
for you. Mike McManus?

02:14.934 --> 02:16.436
Yeah.
Why didn't you say so?

02:16.936 --> 02:19.439
I got distracted by the
doughnuts. Understandable.

02:19.739 --> 02:22.240
Now, you.
Don't ever, I repeat,

02:22.275 --> 02:25.678
don't ever refer to my son
as my gay son.

02:25.713 --> 02:28.313
You got that, asshole?

02:28.348 --> 02:32.185
Now get out there and wash
and polish the rig twice. Okay.

02:32.220 --> 02:34.354
Go!

02:35.855 --> 02:37.690
Sorry, Chief.
Yeah.

02:38.057 --> 02:39.526
Hold on a second.
Hold on.

02:40.026 --> 02:42.494
Come here, come here, come here.
I changed my mind.

02:42.529 --> 02:45.031
Run down to Dunkin' Donuts and
get me a half a dozen jellies...

02:45.066 --> 02:47.033
and one Bavarian cream.

02:47.534 --> 02:49.501
Dunkin' Donuts is,
like, eight blocks. Yeah.

02:49.536 --> 02:53.873
And be back here in 10 minutes or you'll be
washing the rig five times. Now go, asshole.

02:53.908 --> 02:56.709
Jesus. They'll let
anybody in here. Hey, Mike.

02:56.744 --> 02:59.677
How ya doin', kid?
Still at it, huh?

02:59.712 --> 03:02.215
Yeah, well, I'm not about to
retire like some pussies I know.

03:02.715 --> 03:04.682
How's it goin'?
I'm fine, I'm fine.

03:04.717 --> 03:08.186
Good. This afternoon, you
gonna do the bone marrow thing?

03:08.221 --> 03:11.224
I know it's for a good cause, you know,
but I'd rather put my nuts in a vice.

03:11.259 --> 03:14.359
Nobody's asking you to donate.
Mayor's gonna be there.

03:14.394 --> 03:19.232
Then I'm definitely not goin'. We're the
only two donors with surviving recipients.

03:19.267 --> 03:21.401
So why don't you go and talk
to the guy who got your marrow?

03:21.436 --> 03:23.701
What am I gonna say to him?

03:23.736 --> 03:25.703
"How's the marrow workin'
out for you"? I don't know.

03:25.738 --> 03:28.540
Come on. Be a pal. All right,
all right, all right. I'll come.

03:28.575 --> 03:31.077
It'll give me a chance to kick the mayor
in the balls for not giving us a raise.

03:31.112 --> 03:33.246
Yeah, you do that
after the ceremony.

03:33.746 --> 03:35.081
See ya later, fellas.
Bye.

03:35.315 --> 03:38.550
-You know her?
- She looks awfully familiar to me.

03:38.585 --> 03:41.754
She's dated every firefighter
in the tristate area.

03:41.789 --> 03:44.924
She's bangin' somebody
here, huh? Yes, she is.

03:44.959 --> 03:46.926
Oh, shit!

03:47.327 --> 03:51.364
So you're not in jail yet?
No. Why would I be in jail?

03:51.631 --> 03:55.368
Except maybe for killing you, which I'd do
right now except it would interrupt my smoke.

03:55.403 --> 03:58.605
Still going after your
kids? Yep, tomorrow.

03:59.105 --> 04:02.073
You got a plan?
Yeah, I got a plan.

04:02.108 --> 04:06.613
I got a big plan...
which I'm still formulating.

04:06.648 --> 04:08.580
Look, Tommy,
you really think...

04:08.615 --> 04:11.718
that some school is gonna let you
waltz in and just take your kids back?

04:11.753 --> 04:13.685
No. They got a picture of me.

04:13.720 --> 04:15.722
So I figured if I show up, they'd
probably shut the whole state down.

04:16.154 --> 04:19.125
How'd you find out
about the picture?

04:19.160 --> 04:21.628
Colleen told me.
Excuse me?

04:23.630 --> 04:26.382
So now you're using your own
daughter as an accomplice?

04:26.417 --> 04:29.100
She's got my D.N.A., okay?
To help your evil little plan?

04:29.135 --> 04:31.137
She understands. You haven't even
thought this through, have you?

04:31.638 --> 04:33.640
I've thought it through. Where
are those kids gonna sleep, huh?

04:33.675 --> 04:36.160
They're gonna sleep in my
apartment. You got beds?

04:36.195 --> 04:38.610
I got a bed in the bedroom,
and I got the couch.

04:38.645 --> 04:41.648
The couch is a bed. You can sleep
on the couch. Got plenty of beds.

04:41.683 --> 04:44.150
You know, Tommy,
when you pick up the kids,

04:44.185 --> 04:46.117
drop 'em off
in a forest somewhere.

04:46.152 --> 04:49.155
Leave 'em with a pack of wolves, 'cause
they're gonna have a better chance of making it.

04:49.190 --> 04:51.122
Thanks for stopping by.

04:51.157 --> 04:55.460
Tommy, when you're in jail
in some hick town...

04:55.495 --> 04:58.998
and you're taking it up the ass
from Otis the drunk, don't call me.

04:59.033 --> 05:00.934
You'll be on your own,
bro.

05:00.969 --> 05:02.835
No, I won't.
I'll have Otis.

05:09.342 --> 05:12.310
On another day
C'mon, c'mon

05:12.345 --> 05:15.648
With these ropes I tied
can we do no wrong

05:15.683 --> 05:18.449
Now we grieve
'cause now is gone

05:18.484 --> 05:21.854
Things were good
when we were young

05:22.221 --> 05:25.374
With my teeth locked down
I can see the blood

05:25.409 --> 05:28.528
Of a thousand men
who have come and gone

05:28.563 --> 05:31.996
Now we grieve
'cause now is gone

05:32.031 --> 05:35.201
Things were good
when we were young

05:35.236 --> 05:38.336
Is it safe to say
C'mon, c'mon

05:38.371 --> 05:41.624
Was it right to leave
C'mon, c'mon

05:41.659 --> 05:44.936
Will I ever learn
C'mon, c'mon

05:44.971 --> 05:48.214
C'mon, c'mon,
c'mon, c'mon

05:52.185 --> 05:55.555
- Hey. How you doin'?
- Hi, cutes.

05:55.788 --> 05:59.826
Listen, I was thinkin'. When's
your next doctor's appointment?

05:59.861 --> 06:01.728
Why? You know, a couple of months ago,

06:02.228 --> 06:05.732
you were talking about how I should
be more involved in the whole process.

06:05.767 --> 06:08.252
Right? Yeah, and you told
me that I was pregnant...

06:08.287 --> 06:10.737
and that was enough involvement
from your side, so--

06:10.772 --> 06:12.704
See? Now,
that was a joke.

06:12.739 --> 06:16.743
I've been thinking about it, and I think,
you know, I should be-- I should be there.

06:17.243 --> 06:18.976
I should be like a coach,
you know what I mean?

06:19.011 --> 06:21.247
So I thought maybe, you know, I'd
go along on your next appointment...

06:21.748 --> 06:25.084
and check things out, you know,
check out the microwave and the--

06:25.318 --> 06:27.652
- You mean ultrasound?
- Right, the ultrasound.

06:27.687 --> 06:29.689
Oh, well, I just had an
appointment a couple days ago,

06:30.156 --> 06:35.695
and, um, the next one's not
for another month, maybe longer.

06:36.129 --> 06:38.364
Maybe we'd just do a little surprise
visit, take a look at the kid.

06:38.399 --> 06:40.667
Yeah. My doctor really
encourages that, Tommy.

06:40.702 --> 06:42.900
What's your doctor's name again,
by the way?

06:42.935 --> 06:45.521
- Why?
- I'm takin' an interest. What's his name?

06:45.556 --> 06:48.107
I told you his name
a couple of months ago...

06:48.608 --> 06:50.943
when I first wanted you to come to
the appointment, and you blew me off.

06:50.978 --> 06:54.714
So I'm not gonna tell you
now. That's your punishment.

06:55.214 --> 06:58.217
Right. So we can't call the guy
and just ask about stopping by?

07:00.987 --> 07:02.920
It's not a big deal, really.

07:02.955 --> 07:06.459
Who'd you hear that from? Friend
of mine. Pretty reliable source.

07:06.959 --> 07:08.461
So she likes firemen.

07:08.961 --> 07:11.464
Garrity, she's liked half the
F.D.N.Y. at one point or another.

07:11.499 --> 07:13.650
Remember how I kept saying
she looked so familiar?

07:13.685 --> 07:15.802
She was banging Tony the
Fish down in 71 Truck.

07:16.202 --> 07:18.971
That the guy with the webbed toes?
Best swimmer in the department.

07:19.006 --> 07:22.308
Jesus. Well, you know, she's
not with Tony the Fish anymore.

07:22.343 --> 07:24.811
She's with me, okay?
And I think she's pretty neat.

07:25.044 --> 07:27.545
Did you just say neat?
Yeah, I'm sorry.

07:27.580 --> 07:31.083
Look, you know what? It's none of my
business. I just thought you should know.

07:31.118 --> 07:32.985
You know, I appreciate it.
But it doesn't matter...

07:33.486 --> 07:35.988
if she's dated four or five
or a dozen other firemen.

07:36.489 --> 07:38.491
I wouldn't care, really.

07:38.526 --> 07:40.493
Thanks, though.
Okay.

07:40.860 --> 07:43.596
Hey, uh, you think
it's more than a dozen?

07:43.631 --> 07:46.297
Oh, yeah.
Well, that's fine, you know?

07:46.332 --> 07:50.770
I mean, it's not a problem. I just-- I
mean, you know, I've gotten over some stuff.

07:50.805 --> 07:53.840
It's not like I haven't banged 12
chicks in, like, the last three months.

07:53.875 --> 07:56.676
At least you got some help, right?
Yeah, a couple of weeks anyway.

07:56.711 --> 07:59.143
Well, that'll be a relief.
Yeah, but it's different.

07:59.178 --> 08:02.181
What do you mean? I mean,
before, when she was still good,

08:02.216 --> 08:05.184
whenever he'd come to visit,
which wasn't that often-- Right.

08:05.219 --> 08:06.686
I mean, she was there,
you know?

08:07.186 --> 08:09.153
She was right in the middle,
keeping things flowin'.

08:09.188 --> 08:12.191
Even if we hit a rough spot,
she'd jump in and turn it around.

08:12.226 --> 08:14.659
She was the buffer.
Yeah, exactly.

08:14.694 --> 08:18.197
The buffer. Now, most evenings,
she's up in bed by 5:30.

08:18.232 --> 08:20.765
Right. And then I'm stuck. No buffer.

08:20.800 --> 08:23.870
It's just me and him. And
nothing to talk about, right?

08:23.905 --> 08:25.872
Exactly. Not a goddamn word. Wow.

08:26.372 --> 08:27.874
I mean,
it's terrifying, Tommy.

08:28.374 --> 08:30.877
I'm sittin' watchin' the game the other
night in the den, and I'm thinking,

08:30.912 --> 08:32.879
"Please don't come in.
Don't even come in."

08:33.279 --> 08:35.648
Is it a gay thing?
No. It--

08:36.982 --> 08:39.951
Well, maybe a little. Tommy,
he's my own flesh and blood.

08:39.986 --> 08:42.488
You'd think I'd be able to talk to
him. It don't work that way, Chief.

08:42.523 --> 08:44.490
He's not just one of
the guys. He's family.

08:44.790 --> 08:47.660
It's a whole different,
judgmental, ugly goddamn animal.

08:47.960 --> 08:52.498
That's true. I just never
thought of it that way.

08:52.798 --> 08:54.333
This is the moment
that makes...

08:54.834 --> 08:58.536
the F.D.N.Y. bone marrow
donation program so important,

08:58.571 --> 09:03.075
when our brother firefighters can stand
side by side with their marrow recipients,

09:03.576 --> 09:05.578
once again saving a life.

09:06.078 --> 09:10.583
And not through bravery, heroism
or their firefighting skills,

09:11.083 --> 09:14.837
but through the gifts of giving,
of sacrifice, and of caring.

09:14.872 --> 09:18.591
Please give a hand to our F.D.N.Y.
donors and their recipients.

09:26.766 --> 09:28.768
Son of a bitch!

09:30.770 --> 09:33.022
Excuse me.

09:33.057 --> 09:35.274
Jesus!

09:39.278 --> 09:42.246
Aah! Yeah.

09:42.281 --> 09:44.283
You Gavin? Yeah. What are
you doin' in my apartment?

09:44.318 --> 09:47.286
It's my apartment.
Get your ass in here.

09:48.788 --> 09:51.589
You must be
the F.B.I. guy, huh?

09:51.624 --> 09:54.592
What the hell are
you doin' here? I--

09:54.627 --> 09:57.630
I asked your brother about a hundred
times to tell you to keep a low profile.

09:57.665 --> 10:00.097
You couldn't keep
a higher profile if you tried.

10:00.132 --> 10:03.135
I got so many complaints, the board's
talking about kicking me out, asshole.

10:03.170 --> 10:05.137
No, no. I was--
I was keeping a low profile.

10:05.172 --> 10:07.156
And what's this?
What's this tape?

10:07.191 --> 10:09.106
I was asking myself
the same thing.

10:09.141 --> 10:12.144
First day I moved in here-- I was gonna
take it down-- Yeah, it's pretty amazing.

10:12.179 --> 10:14.981
Did you tell one of my
neighbors to suck your balls? No.

10:15.016 --> 10:17.448
No, that was this guy,
this weird guy.

10:17.483 --> 10:21.153
Some kind of crazy guy was coming
through and screaming in the hallway.

10:21.188 --> 10:24.824
I stuck my head out. He did mention
something about sucking his balls.

10:24.859 --> 10:27.792
Uh-huh. I come in here,
the place stinks of pot.

10:27.827 --> 10:30.329
There's a puddle of beer on
my couch. No, no, no. Can't be.

10:30.830 --> 10:33.332
I don't smoke pot and I quit
drinkin', so-- No, no. Not you.

10:33.833 --> 10:36.067
Her. Her and her little friend
that were here. I come in here.

10:36.102 --> 10:39.839
They got a big doobie goin'. They're
on my cocktail table in her underwear...

10:39.874 --> 10:44.844
dancin' around drinking tall boys
with the stereo going full blast.

10:44.879 --> 10:47.645
In your underwear?
We got hot from dancing.

10:47.680 --> 10:50.783
Oh, I'm sure you did. Yeah.
Who brought the pot?

10:50.818 --> 10:52.483
Jennifer, Dad.

10:52.518 --> 10:54.020
Okay. That's it. You're not
going out with her anymore.

10:54.520 --> 10:56.355
Your lesbian thing is over.
Daddy--

10:56.390 --> 10:58.155
Aah, aah, aah, aah!

10:58.190 --> 11:00.960
Hey, listen, do your parenting
somewhere else. You got an hour.

11:01.227 --> 11:03.661
An hour to do what?

11:03.696 --> 11:06.163
To take the tape down? To
pack your stuff and get out.

11:06.198 --> 11:09.368
What, you think you can just
kick us out of this place? Yeah.

11:09.403 --> 11:11.669
Oh, that's right.
It's your apartment. I forgot.

11:11.704 --> 11:15.708
Look, I have two more kids
of mine coming, and-- Get out.

11:16.208 --> 11:18.175
Okay.
Mr. Big Shot, huh?

11:18.210 --> 11:21.213
Just come in and kick people out
of apartments. All right, fine.

11:21.714 --> 11:23.716
Where were you at
before 9/11, Big Shot,

11:24.216 --> 11:26.218
with some of the information
that could've captured Bin Laden?

11:26.719 --> 11:28.686
Where were you then?
Nowhere. No F.B.I.

11:28.721 --> 11:31.689
No. You know why? The F.B.I.
sucks. C.I.A. all the way.

11:31.724 --> 11:35.728
Get your stuff. I'm not takin' that
tape down either. Okay, asshole?

11:38.230 --> 11:41.734
So where are you from, Leon? New York.

11:41.769 --> 11:44.737
Oh. Born and raised?
No.

11:49.742 --> 11:52.745
But you're feeling okay? I mean,
I know that transplant procedure...

11:52.780 --> 11:56.248
can be pretty painful, having
lived through one end of it.

11:56.283 --> 11:58.250
But, uh--
But, uh, you're good?

12:00.753 --> 12:03.721
I guess.

12:03.756 --> 12:07.259
Come on! Come on! I wanna
introduce you to my guy. He's great.

12:07.760 --> 12:10.763
We got tickets for the Mets
game. We're going tomorrow.

12:11.263 --> 12:13.731
How's your guy?
I don't think I should be here.

12:13.766 --> 12:18.771
Why not? 'Cause after talking to
him, I don't think my guy survived.

12:18.806 --> 12:23.776
Hey, listen, I wanted to ask you
somethin' I've been thinking about.

12:24.276 --> 12:25.743
They're real.

12:25.778 --> 12:27.745
What? Oh. Jesus.
Hey, look.

12:27.780 --> 12:30.247
No, that's good. That's
good to know. I just--

12:30.282 --> 12:32.785
And, listen, you don't have to
answer this if you don't want to.

12:32.820 --> 12:36.789
What?
I'll tell you anything.

12:36.824 --> 12:39.256
Okay. Um,

12:39.291 --> 12:42.294
have you dated any other
firefighters before?

12:42.329 --> 12:44.762
Why? Jealous?
No, no.

12:44.797 --> 12:50.302
I just was wondering. Sean, I will
always, always tell you the truth.

12:50.337 --> 12:53.806
Okay.
The answer is yes.

12:53.841 --> 12:56.826
Okay. Okay.

12:56.861 --> 12:59.777
That's fine.

12:59.812 --> 13:03.280
How many, would you say?
A couple.

13:03.315 --> 13:06.318
I don't know. I forgot
everybody else once I met you.

13:06.353 --> 13:09.321
That's very sweet.

13:10.823 --> 13:12.825
So, like, four or five,
maybe? Ball park figure?

13:12.860 --> 13:14.792
I don't remember.
What?

13:14.827 --> 13:18.796
Who cares, baby?
It's just you and me now.

13:18.831 --> 13:20.833
I know. I know. You're
right. You're totally right.

13:20.868 --> 13:23.801
I just--

13:23.836 --> 13:26.839
You're right.
So where did you meet 'em?

13:26.874 --> 13:29.359
Who? The guys. All these firefighters.

13:29.394 --> 13:31.809
You know how it is.
You date a guy.

13:31.844 --> 13:34.096
You get to know
his firefighter buddies.

13:34.131 --> 13:36.313
You meet all the guys
in his house. I know.

13:36.348 --> 13:39.852
But you don't have to, like,
sleep with all of 'em.

13:39.887 --> 13:41.819
Ah.
I'm gonna go home.

13:41.854 --> 13:44.356
No, I didn't-- I didn't mean
that. Really, Heather, seriously.

13:44.391 --> 13:47.324
I-I-- I'm sorry.
You're great and I'm an idiot,

13:47.359 --> 13:49.361
and I just-- I might have just
ruined a really fantastic evening.

13:49.396 --> 13:52.364
Yeah. I'm sorry. I'm really sorry.

13:55.367 --> 13:58.871
It's just you and me, right?
I don't know.

13:58.906 --> 14:00.873
What do you mean,
you don't know?

14:05.211 --> 14:08.179
Mom was up.

14:08.214 --> 14:13.219
Said something about going into the
city for the white sale at Macy's.

14:13.254 --> 14:15.221
I put her back into bed.

14:18.657 --> 14:20.624
Yeah, I'm gonna go up.

14:20.659 --> 14:22.661
The game just started,
didn't it?

14:23.162 --> 14:25.414
I'm just--
I'm bushed.

14:25.449 --> 14:27.666
I'll see you tomorrow.

14:34.640 --> 14:36.640
You didn't have to give him the
bone marrow, you know what I mean?

14:36.675 --> 14:40.679
Well, you know, it's not like I needed
to go through that delightful procedure.

14:40.714 --> 14:43.147
Nobody likes getting wheeled into
surgery and having a spigot...

14:43.182 --> 14:47.186
shoved into their spine like a goddamn
maple tree at the height of sap season.

14:47.686 --> 14:49.153
Right.
That thing hurt.

14:49.188 --> 14:51.690
And not one word of thanks. I
mean, that's just incredible to me.

14:52.191 --> 14:55.194
I am tempted to go call H.Q.,
find this guy's name, number,

14:55.229 --> 14:57.661
go over there
and give him both barrels.

14:57.696 --> 15:00.199
Am I wrong? No. You're
absolutely not wrong.

15:00.499 --> 15:03.435
Thank you. Can I crash at your
place for a couple of nights?

15:03.470 --> 15:05.903
What's wrong with your
apartment? Well, long story.

15:05.938 --> 15:07.940
Colleen's staying over at my dad's house,
but there's no way I'm staying over there...

15:07.975 --> 15:09.740
with the dragon lady
and her 110 cats.

15:09.775 --> 15:12.444
You got room, right? You
know, Tom, I sold the house.

15:12.479 --> 15:14.245
When?
A couple weeks ago.

15:14.280 --> 15:17.283
Too many memories. Tired of knocking
around there at night all by myself.

15:17.318 --> 15:20.970
So where are you staying? At the
firehouse. Don't tell anybody.

15:21.005 --> 15:24.623
Okay. Plenty of room if you
want to join me. But one thing.

15:24.658 --> 15:26.458
Yeah?
I don't spoon.

15:27.459 --> 15:30.229
Since when?

15:32.000 --> 15:38.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

15:58.324 --> 16:01.593
Damien?

16:05.331 --> 16:07.333
Hello?

16:28.354 --> 16:32.358
Dr. Feinberg's office.
This is Jill.

16:32.858 --> 16:35.861
Oh, no problem. Take your
time. He's running late.

16:35.896 --> 16:39.048
Okay, we'll see you then. Bye. Hi.

16:39.083 --> 16:42.166
Hi. Can I help you?
Yeah, I'm, uh--

16:42.201 --> 16:45.537
I'm with Sheila Keefe.
She's having a baby.

16:45.771 --> 16:48.540
Oh, you're Mr. Keefe?
Uh, yeah.

16:48.575 --> 16:51.008
Have a seat, Mr. Keefe.

16:51.043 --> 16:53.545
I'll, uh, let Dr. Feinberg
know you're here. Thank you.

16:56.048 --> 16:58.015
Hey, Garrity, can I
talk to you? Yeah, sure.

16:58.050 --> 17:01.018
What's goin' on? It's about
that new girl you've been datin'.

17:01.053 --> 17:04.556
Look, Chief, if it's about all the other
firefighters she's dated, I've heard it, all right?

17:04.590 --> 17:07.023
No, no, no. It isn't.
Well, maybe it is.

17:07.059 --> 17:11.028
Perolli just, uh, read that report
about the fire in the apartment.

17:11.063 --> 17:14.566
It was her friend's apartment. Her third
friend's apartment where a fire broke out.

17:14.601 --> 17:17.470
So? Two of 'em, includin' the
fire that you responded to,

17:17.505 --> 17:20.339
started when the candles
were too close to the curtain.

17:20.606 --> 17:25.077
And the third, some old newspaper
fell into a bathtub and caught on fire.

17:25.577 --> 17:28.747
See what I'm gettin' at here?
No. What exactly are you saying?

17:28.981 --> 17:30.849
I have to spell this out
for you?

17:30.884 --> 17:32.584
Actually, yeah.

17:32.951 --> 17:35.020
Your little friend
is a firebug. Chief--

17:35.454 --> 17:37.388
It makes sense. She dates
bunches of firefighters.

17:37.423 --> 17:39.723
That's where you meet guys like
that-- when you start your own fires.

17:39.758 --> 17:42.094
It's not true. I'm so sick and tired
of everybody telling me what's going on.

17:42.129 --> 17:44.596
It's not the case, Chief.
Garrity. Garrity.

17:45.097 --> 17:50.602
No fire starts in an empty
bathtub unless somebody lights it.

17:51.103 --> 17:53.105
Get rid of her.
Mm-hmm.

17:57.309 --> 18:02.114
So, what exactly is the, um,
situation here, Mr. Keefe?

18:02.481 --> 18:05.416
Well, um,
she and I are not--

18:05.451 --> 18:10.456
We're separated, so we're
not, um, really communicating.

18:10.956 --> 18:14.925
It's, um--
Long story short--

18:14.960 --> 18:17.563
Look, I, um--
I do this for a living.

18:18.063 --> 18:23.068
Deliver babies and deal with all
the varied and storied aspects...

18:23.569 --> 18:25.070
to male and female
relationships.

18:25.537 --> 18:28.038
If she hasn't been keeping you
up to date with the pregnancy,

18:28.073 --> 18:32.978
believe me, I have seen every available
meditation on that particular theme.

18:33.013 --> 18:36.482
Now, what was the last piece of
information she shared with you?

18:36.517 --> 18:39.318
That she was having
a healthy and happy baby.

18:41.920 --> 18:44.455
Why?

18:44.490 --> 18:46.992
Look, I, um--
I have other patients.

18:47.493 --> 18:50.294
I'm gonna give you
a couple of minutes.

18:50.329 --> 18:54.166
The information you're looking
for is on the top sheet.

19:14.786 --> 19:16.753
Mr. Keefe?
Yeah?

19:16.788 --> 19:21.293
The, uh, doctor
needs his room back.

19:21.328 --> 19:23.695
All right, yeah.

19:28.200 --> 19:30.202
Cocksucker!

19:33.205 --> 19:35.672
Jesus!

19:35.707 --> 19:38.477
Here's the thing.
At first, I was livid.

19:38.512 --> 19:40.677
That's why I ain't been around.

19:40.712 --> 19:44.216
My best friend, my cousin,
banging my wife, my widow.

19:44.716 --> 19:47.684
We were in the same house,
the same crew together.

19:47.719 --> 19:51.156
You-You broke so many rules, I-I
just-- I didn't know what to do.

19:51.191 --> 19:52.991
- Jimmy, listen--
- Shut up!

19:53.292 --> 19:56.061
You shut up now, or I'll
kill you. You understand that?

19:56.096 --> 19:59.415
I'll snap your neck and
I'll drag your sorry ass ...

19:59.450 --> 20:02.677
right into this endless
goddamn limbo I exist in!

20:02.712 --> 20:05.904
What happened was, she had
the thing, the microwave.

20:05.939 --> 20:08.038
The ultrasound.

20:08.073 --> 20:12.376
Right. And it was a girl,
Tom. All right? It was a girl.

20:12.411 --> 20:17.249
Not that you ever cared enough
to find out, but it was a girl,

20:17.284 --> 20:21.253
which is why I just sat back
and I sucked it up for her.

20:21.753 --> 20:24.189
I wanted her to be happy.
Just try and do...

20:24.224 --> 20:28.058
the right thing by her,
you prick!

20:28.093 --> 20:31.363
And now, this. Shit!
She always wanted a girl.

20:34.600 --> 20:37.603
Now-- Now you gotta
do this for me, Tom.

20:37.638 --> 20:39.336
Do what?

20:39.371 --> 20:41.572
Get her pregnant again,
asshole!

20:41.607 --> 20:44.776
I'm not getting her pregnant
again, man. Yes, you are!

20:46.878 --> 20:49.580
I ain't asking you, asshole.
I'm tellin' you.

20:49.615 --> 20:53.669
You gotta bang her brains out
until she gets a girl!

20:53.704 --> 20:57.723
I don't care if it takes
five goddamn years, numb nuts!

20:59.958 --> 21:03.128
Not doin' it.

21:04.963 --> 21:09.067
I said I'm not doin' it, Jimmy.

21:09.102 --> 21:13.036
Aah!
Um, Mr. Keefe,

21:13.071 --> 21:18.076
I know it was a shock,
but, uh--

21:22.314 --> 21:24.316
My glasses.

21:31.156 --> 21:34.159
Stay in the truck. What are
we doing at Aunt Sheila's?

21:34.194 --> 21:36.495
Stay in the truck!

21:36.862 --> 21:39.331
Jesus Christ!

21:39.831 --> 21:42.333
Time for talking, bitch. Oh,
my God! Okay, wait, wait, wait!

21:42.368 --> 21:44.836
Why didn't you tell me? Huh?
Let me explain to you!

21:45.337 --> 21:49.675
My wife stole my kids because of you. I got
kicked out of my firehouse because of you!

21:50.042 --> 21:52.277
Check your cock, asshole! He
might just disagree with you!

21:55.180 --> 21:58.684
Time to eat. You're eating
for two now, right? Huh?

21:58.719 --> 22:01.585
No!

22:01.620 --> 22:04.623
Get back here!
You'd better get back here!

22:04.658 --> 22:06.625
No!
Bitch!

22:09.127 --> 22:14.132
You happy now? Huh? This is how
we honor Jimmy's memory, huh?

22:14.167 --> 22:18.136
Nice.
Real nice.

22:18.403 --> 22:20.337
No, please don't go.
I love you so much!

22:20.372 --> 22:25.175
Don't you walk out on me!
Don't you leave me!

22:25.210 --> 22:28.213
You told me I was the closest thing
you had to Jimmy on this Earth.

22:28.248 --> 22:32.050
And that was the same way
I felt about you.

22:32.551 --> 22:35.053
And this is what
you do to me, goddamn it?

22:39.558 --> 22:41.858
He used to come and see me.
Who, Jimmy?

22:41.893 --> 22:45.128
He was with me today at
the doctor's office. Bitch!

22:45.163 --> 22:50.402
Wait! What are you talking
about? What did he say to you?

22:53.238 --> 22:55.706
What did he say? What did
he-- Did he know about us?

22:55.741 --> 22:59.745
Did he know about the baby? Did
he know that it was a little girl?

22:59.780 --> 23:01.747
Shut up.

23:02.247 --> 23:04.715
Please don't go.
Please don't go.

23:04.750 --> 23:08.754
I love you so much.
I didn't know how to tell you.

23:09.254 --> 23:13.759
I didn't know how to tell you.
I was scared! I was scared!

23:47.225 --> 23:51.094
Can I help you?
Ken Shea.

23:51.129 --> 23:55.133
- Remember? We met yesterday.
- Yeah. Yeah, sure.

23:55.168 --> 23:57.934
What do you want?
What do I want?

23:57.969 --> 24:00.972
You know, you're unbelievable.
What do you think I want?

24:01.007 --> 24:03.809
I don't know.
I'm upstairs watching a show.

24:04.309 --> 24:06.777
I don't wanna miss too much
of it. Oh, is that right?

24:06.812 --> 24:09.314
I watched a show about a year
and a half ago. It's called...

24:09.349 --> 24:11.817
Stick a Needle in My Spine and
Take Me Down About Half a Quart.

24:13.819 --> 24:16.321
Is this about the bone marrow? Yes.

24:16.822 --> 24:18.323
Believe it or not, yes,
it's about the bone marrow.

24:18.824 --> 24:20.325
I thought you would have
a little bone marrow etiquette.

24:20.826 --> 24:24.162
If someone gives you something, you say
thank you. Or is that too much to ask?

24:24.663 --> 24:27.165
- Thank you.
- Yeah, well, the thing is now, I had to get you to thank me.

24:27.666 --> 24:29.668
It doesn't make any--

24:32.170 --> 24:34.137
This was a mistake coming here.

24:34.172 --> 24:38.176
Good-bye.
Enjoy the marrow, asshole.

24:38.211 --> 24:41.697
Uh, I'm sorry, Ken.

24:41.732 --> 24:45.148
Can I buy you a drink?

24:45.183 --> 24:47.150
And you're sure
you didn't take them?

24:47.185 --> 24:49.938
How many times you gonna ask me
that? I told you I didn't take 'em.

24:49.973 --> 24:52.656
What, are you callin' me a liar?
You gave me the bottle. It was full.

24:52.691 --> 24:55.694
The next time I saw it, it was half empty.
I never even opened the goddamn thing.

24:56.194 --> 24:58.662
Well, I can't get you more
until early next week.

24:58.697 --> 25:02.701
You are kidding me, right? Well, I told
you, I'm going home to see my folks.

25:02.736 --> 25:05.203
My mother's been sick, and--
You know what? I'm sick, okay?

25:05.238 --> 25:07.671
Right here. I'm livin'
with some serious pain.

25:07.706 --> 25:10.208
I think it's time you see a doctor
if your shoulder hurts that bad.

25:10.243 --> 25:13.677
You know what? Forget
about it. Have a nice trip,

25:13.712 --> 25:17.382
tell your mother I said hello, and
thanks for goddamn nothin', bitch!

25:17.417 --> 25:21.052
Daddy, you should talk nice on the
phone. You tell me to talk nice.

25:21.087 --> 25:22.853
Yeah, I know, honey.

25:22.888 --> 25:26.391
Sweetie, have you seen Daddy's little
pill bottle here? Daddy's medicine?

25:26.426 --> 25:28.560
You know where that is?
The little bottle?

25:28.595 --> 25:31.361
Yeah. It was right here.
I--

25:31.396 --> 25:33.498
I took it and I gave some
to my bears.

25:33.765 --> 25:38.069
Honey, you don't touch
Daddy's things, okay?

25:38.303 --> 25:40.839
Just like Daddy doesn't go
touching your dolls or your bears.

25:41.306 --> 25:43.842
Now, where's my medicine?
I'll show you.

25:44.109 --> 25:46.077
Okay.

25:50.081 --> 25:53.483
She wasn't bad today, huh?

25:53.518 --> 25:56.987
Took a shower
without incident.

25:57.022 --> 26:00.025
Told me a couple stories
about Grandma.

26:00.060 --> 26:02.027
Clear as a bell.

26:02.527 --> 26:04.029
Lots of detail.

26:06.031 --> 26:09.534
Maybe we should get a journal and
you should write this stuff down...

26:09.569 --> 26:12.037
so when, uh--

26:12.537 --> 26:14.940
Not easy, is it?

26:16.274 --> 26:17.776
It's a hateful disease.

26:19.778 --> 26:22.781
Actually,
I was talking about us.

26:25.784 --> 26:28.752
Never been easy,

26:28.787 --> 26:32.290
but it seemed easier
when she was refereeing.

26:32.325 --> 26:35.759
Well, whatever she did.

26:35.794 --> 26:38.797
I'm gonna go upstairs and read.
No.

26:41.299 --> 26:43.301
Stay, Dad.

26:43.802 --> 26:46.538
Let's talk.

26:46.573 --> 26:49.239
About what?

26:49.274 --> 26:52.510
All the stuff
we never talked about,

26:52.545 --> 26:55.747
which would be
pretty much everything.

26:56.247 --> 26:59.250
I'm pretty exhausted. We were runnin'
in and out of the firehouse all day.

26:59.285 --> 27:01.753
Are you really
that scared?

27:09.761 --> 27:13.765
All right.
Let's talk.

27:17.268 --> 27:20.271
Okay, Keela, now Daddy is getting
very angry. Where are my pills?

27:20.306 --> 27:22.674
Mr. Bailey had them.

27:23.174 --> 27:25.677
Yeah, well, Mr. Bailey doesn't have
any pills now. So where are they?

27:25.712 --> 27:28.697
- Maybe they're under the bed.
- I looked under the bed, Keela.

27:28.732 --> 27:31.876
- Maybe that's where they are.
- I said I looked under the bed!

27:31.911 --> 27:35.020
You want me to look again, I
can look again. No, no pills.

27:35.055 --> 27:37.289
I can look under every
goddamn inch of this place.

27:37.324 --> 27:39.524
Is that what you want, Keela?
Is that what you want?

27:39.559 --> 27:43.994
The city
is so beautiful today.

27:44.029 --> 27:47.532
I mean, that air.
Where's that air coming from?

27:48.033 --> 27:53.038
Must be Canada. It's so
clean and crisp and clear.

27:55.040 --> 27:57.007
What are you doing?

27:57.042 --> 28:01.880
Uh, I was just-- I was
thinking. About what?

28:03.214 --> 28:06.217
You know that fire in your
friend's apartment the other day?

28:06.252 --> 28:08.386
You wanna tell me about it?
Tell you what?

28:08.887 --> 28:11.389
I don't know. How did
it start? I don't know.

28:11.424 --> 28:13.857
I was sitting there.
I smelled smoke, and--

28:13.892 --> 28:16.394
'Cause you know what? People have
been saying some things about you.

28:16.429 --> 28:18.897
I mean, three fires in friends'
apartments. What is that?

28:18.932 --> 28:20.565
One in the bathtub?
Come on.

28:21.066 --> 28:23.068
I thought you were gonna be honest
with me. I am being honest with you.

28:23.103 --> 28:24.903
You're not.

28:26.071 --> 28:28.907
Okay, I started
the one in the bathtub.

28:32.744 --> 28:35.211
Look, I was lonely, Sean.

28:35.246 --> 28:37.213
Look, I'll never do it again.
Well, that's--

28:37.248 --> 28:39.751
I'm glad to hear that.
But you know what? I can't--

28:39.786 --> 28:41.718
I can't see you anymore.

28:41.753 --> 28:44.589
I mean, what you did, that goes
against everything that I am.

28:44.624 --> 28:47.425
I said I'd never do it again.
No, it's fine.

28:47.460 --> 28:50.393
I'm sorry.
I thought this was--

28:50.428 --> 28:54.098
Sean, I'm sorry. Look,
nobody got hurt. Yeah.

28:54.133 --> 28:57.734
Nobody. Sean-- Come
on. Don't be like this.

28:57.769 --> 29:02.190
I am never getting married,
and I'm never getting pregnant.

29:02.225 --> 29:06.576
Well, you just made your dad
a very happy man, sweetheart.

29:06.611 --> 29:09.114
I thought Aunt Sheila was gonna pop
a vein right there in the street.

29:09.149 --> 29:12.617
Yeah. Don't worry about
Aunt Sheila anymore.

29:13.118 --> 29:15.120
She's out of the picture.

29:19.124 --> 29:21.591
I'm bored.

29:21.626 --> 29:24.094
Well, I'd get up
and do a jig for ya,

29:24.129 --> 29:27.632
but I'm a little busy doing something
I like to call driving right now.

29:32.137 --> 29:34.639
It didn't take this long
when Mom drove.

29:35.140 --> 29:37.107
Take a nap.

29:37.142 --> 29:40.645
- I'm too bored to take a nap.
- This is gonna be fun.

29:41.146 --> 29:42.647
- What?
- I said, I'm bored.

29:47.652 --> 29:50.655
Can I get two more down
here, please? Thanks.

29:52.157 --> 29:57.627
So, you had the surgery.
Yeah. Yeah, and I got better.

29:57.662 --> 30:01.166
As far as my health is concerned,
I don't think I've ever felt better.

30:01.201 --> 30:03.967
Well, you know,
that's kind of surprising,

30:04.002 --> 30:07.505
'cause you don't really come across as
a guy that just got a new lease on life.

30:07.540 --> 30:12.510
After I got out of the hospital,
everything went to shit.

30:12.545 --> 30:15.013
My wife left me.
Sorry to hear that.

30:15.048 --> 30:17.981
I sort of don't blame her.

30:18.016 --> 30:21.519
We both thought maybe
I was gonna die,

30:21.554 --> 30:24.522
so our relationship changed.

30:25.023 --> 30:27.525
It was, like,
she'd take care of me.

30:28.026 --> 30:31.779
Then I'd die.
Then she'd meet somebody else.

30:31.814 --> 30:35.533
And me not dying
put a big wrench into that.

30:35.568 --> 30:40.538
So she, uh,
went ahead as scheduled.

30:40.573 --> 30:43.006
Yeah. Yeah,
I met the guy.

30:43.041 --> 30:46.544
Sat down with them.
Had a drink.

30:47.045 --> 30:49.047
I think they're happy.
That's strange.

30:49.547 --> 30:53.051
My wife left me recently
for another guy,

30:53.551 --> 30:58.556
and I sat down
and had a drink with him.

30:59.057 --> 31:01.024
Weird.

31:01.059 --> 31:05.063
Oh, forget it.
What?

31:07.498 --> 31:09.465
The problems with
you and your wife,

31:09.500 --> 31:13.037
I mean, maybe they were
'cause of my marrow.

31:13.072 --> 31:15.006
Like it's cursed or something.

31:18.009 --> 31:20.511
I never thought of that.
Shit.

31:22.013 --> 31:25.266
That bone marrow
transfusion thing--

31:25.301 --> 31:28.519
that was...
pretty painful, right?

31:28.554 --> 31:31.988
Yeah.

31:32.023 --> 31:35.526
Why?
I think I might need one.

31:36.027 --> 31:38.529
Oh, come on. There must be
something you want to ask me.

31:41.532 --> 31:44.035
Who's the girl?
Huh?

31:44.535 --> 31:47.038
I mean, in the relationship,
who's the girl?

31:47.538 --> 31:49.040
We're both men.

31:52.543 --> 31:55.546
But Steve is probably
the girl more than I am.

31:57.048 --> 31:59.550
Good, 'cause if you
were the girl, that--

31:59.585 --> 32:02.553
that would've been
tough on me.

32:05.056 --> 32:08.559
So why do you think you're-- What
is it that you think made you--

32:09.060 --> 32:11.062
Gay?

32:11.097 --> 32:13.029
Yeah.

32:13.064 --> 32:16.467
I feel like
I was born that way.

32:17.969 --> 32:20.471
I mean, I just don't know if
there was anything that I did...

32:20.506 --> 32:25.977
that turned you
the way you are.

32:26.477 --> 32:31.316
No. No.
I was, uh, born who I am.

32:33.151 --> 32:35.153
It's not your fault, Dad.
Don't worry.

32:35.653 --> 32:37.155
I didn't think so.

32:37.655 --> 32:39.157
If I could have...

32:39.657 --> 32:43.661
any person's marrow
in the world,

32:43.696 --> 32:47.665
in the whole world,
right,

32:47.700 --> 32:50.633
it'd be yours.

32:50.668 --> 32:53.171
Or Ellen DeGeneres's.

32:54.672 --> 32:56.841
Why Ellen DeGeneres's?

32:56.876 --> 32:59.010
I think she's funny.

32:59.510 --> 33:02.513
I gotta go. Why don't you settle
up here, and let's get out of here.

33:03.014 --> 33:05.016
Okay.

33:07.518 --> 33:10.521
Okay, I owe 7.50.
You have the rest.

33:12.523 --> 33:15.026
What do you mean? You-You expect me
to pay? You invited me out for a drink.

33:16.527 --> 33:19.363
That's right,adrink.
I'm paying for one drink.

33:19.398 --> 33:22.165
Okay? That was the deal.
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

33:22.200 --> 33:24.702
This is a joke, right? 'Cause
you remember who I am, right?

33:24.737 --> 33:27.170
I'm the guy who gave you your
bone marrow. You remember that?

33:27.205 --> 33:30.708
Does that ring a goddamn bell? Yeah,
maybe I didn't want your marrow.

33:30.743 --> 33:33.711
Maybe my wife left me
because of your marrow.

33:33.746 --> 33:36.214
All right?
Your tainted marrow.

33:39.717 --> 33:42.185
Give it back.
What?

33:42.220 --> 33:47.225
Give me back my goddamn bone
marrow now! I want it! Give it back!

33:47.260 --> 33:49.192
Give me back my marrow!
Hey!

33:49.227 --> 33:51.729
Just give it back! Stay
away from me, all right?

33:51.764 --> 33:55.698
This is my marrow now,
jerk!

33:55.733 --> 33:59.237
You come around me again, I'm
calling the cops! Go call the cops!

33:59.272 --> 34:02.507
Where were they
when you needed marrow?

34:02.542 --> 34:05.743
You loser! Hey, keep it! Keep my marrow!

34:05.778 --> 34:08.246
I hope you choke on it!

34:21.759 --> 34:23.726
I don't think that covers it,

34:23.761 --> 34:28.766
but, you know,
I'm a firefighter.

34:32.770 --> 34:36.774
I mean, when you were little,
I used to think about...

34:36.809 --> 34:39.793
what you'd be like
when you grew up.

34:39.829 --> 34:42.745
I thought you'd be
a different person.

34:42.780 --> 34:47.217
A regular guy, you know? Somebody I
could bring to a ball game, you know?

34:47.253 --> 34:51.187
I like sports. I'd love
to go to a game with you.

34:51.222 --> 34:55.476
I guess I spent a lot of time
dreaming about who you'd be.

34:55.511 --> 34:59.730
Let's just say you didn't
turn out the way I expected.

35:02.233 --> 35:04.700
Look at me, Dad.

35:04.735 --> 35:08.739
You can hang onto your dream kid
from a million years ago,

35:08.774 --> 35:10.908
or you can start
dealing with me.

35:10.943 --> 35:13.644
Start being a father
to me.

35:18.149 --> 35:20.151
It's tough lettin' go
of your dreams, you know?

35:23.154 --> 35:25.156
I know.

35:29.660 --> 35:31.662
I dream too.

35:33.664 --> 35:36.132
I dream of you saying
you're proud of me.

35:36.167 --> 35:41.672
I dream of you hugging me
like you did when I was little.

35:41.707 --> 35:45.610
My nose full of sweat
and smoke...

35:45.645 --> 35:48.578
and Aqua Velva.

35:48.613 --> 35:51.115
And you telling me
you love me.

35:53.618 --> 35:55.620
I dream of you being
interested in my life...

35:55.655 --> 35:58.140
and wanting to be
a part of it.

35:58.175 --> 36:00.625
Maybe we should both
stop dreaming.

36:03.127 --> 36:08.533
Why? Because they're
never gonna come true?

36:08.568 --> 36:13.037
I wish I-I could, uh,

36:15.540 --> 36:17.542
accept--

36:19.544 --> 36:21.546
It's a lot.

36:22.046 --> 36:24.549
I know.

36:39.497 --> 36:42.450
I told you to go to sleep.

36:42.485 --> 36:45.368
You're mad at me.

36:45.403 --> 36:48.906
Yeah, you bet I'm mad at you!
Now, stop crying and go to bed.

37:32.550 --> 37:36.053
Listen, I, uh--

37:37.288 --> 37:39.255
I feel kind of bad
about this.

37:39.290 --> 37:43.628
It was never my intention to drag
you into this whole situation.

37:43.663 --> 37:47.965
Unfortunately, um, I really
had no choice, you know.

37:48.000 --> 37:52.803
I, um--
You know, your mother--

37:53.037 --> 37:55.538
This whole thing was her
idea. I mean-- Listen.

37:55.573 --> 37:58.476
If I'm not back in 10 minutes,
it means something's gone wrong.

37:58.709 --> 38:01.245
If that happens, I'll grab the
kids, go through the side entrance...

38:01.280 --> 38:03.045
and cut through the woods
behind the school.

38:03.080 --> 38:05.816
There's a gas station one
block down and two blocks over.

38:06.317 --> 38:09.820
Meet me there in 15 minutes, and
make sure you're not followed. Got it?

38:09.855 --> 38:11.322
Yeah.
Okay, 15 minutes?

38:11.822 --> 38:13.824
I got it.

38:17.328 --> 38:19.330
That's my girl.

38:21.332 --> 38:23.334
Two blocks down--

38:23.369 --> 38:25.801
Wait.

38:25.836 --> 38:28.105
One-One block down,
two blocks over.

38:31.842 --> 38:34.143
- Hi.
- Can I help you?

38:34.178 --> 38:37.515
Yeah, my name's Colleen Gavin. My
little brother and sister go here,

38:38.015 --> 38:40.017
and they forgot to take
their medicine this morning.

38:40.052 --> 38:42.019
So my mom told me to come
and make sure they got it.

38:42.054 --> 38:44.021
Sure. One second.

38:50.027 --> 38:54.865
Is it two blocks up and one
block over? One block up.

38:54.900 --> 38:56.367
Two blocks up--

38:56.867 --> 38:58.369
Hey!
Dad!

38:58.869 --> 39:00.871
What's goin' on, guys?
Hey! I missed you!

39:01.372 --> 39:02.707
I missed you too.
Looks like everybody.

39:02.742 --> 39:04.709
All right, guys,
we gotta go.

39:05.209 --> 39:09.380
Put your seat belts on.
Everybody buckle up. Act normal.

39:09.415 --> 39:13.884
Act normal, okay?
Dad, that was so cool.

39:30.067 --> 39:33.571
Keela, honey, come on.
I'm gonna be late for work.

39:33.606 --> 39:35.573
Keela?

40:26.457 --> 40:28.125
Taxi!

40:32.296 --> 40:37.802
Dropped to the ground And
the people ran to a place

40:37.837 --> 40:41.072
Where the pavement
was soaked

40:41.107 --> 40:44.308
With the life
of a holy ghost

40:46.277 --> 40:51.614
And a fox
hovered over the crowd

40:51.649 --> 40:56.821
And she mocked and destroyed
the sound of the cries

40:56.856 --> 40:59.288
In the eyes of the Lord

40:59.323 --> 41:04.829
Who gave me a message
and saved my soul, said

41:04.864 --> 41:08.099
I can't be

41:08.134 --> 41:11.335
Broken down

41:13.337 --> 41:17.306
By the sword

41:17.341 --> 41:23.514
'Cause it's life or death
to me

41:23.549 --> 41:27.618
Shifting moons

41:27.918 --> 41:31.487
Overnight

41:31.522 --> 41:36.425
Keep me floating
over streets

41:36.460 --> 41:43.467
Of a total soul they leave
not broken down

41:45.469 --> 41:49.256
Not broken down

41:49.291 --> 41:53.043
Not broken down

41:54.545 --> 42:01.385
Not broken down

43:11.055 --> 43:12.456
Cloudland.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
