seven, eight,

00:24.733 --> 00:26.652
nine, ten...

00:26.694 --> 00:28.737
I don't want to play
this game anymore.

00:28.779 --> 00:30.614
This game is not fun!

00:34.869 --> 00:38.038
[music continues]

00:39.498 --> 00:42.125
Where did you go? I'm scared.

00:55.764 --> 00:57.933
Come on.
Don't you wanna play my games?

00:57.975 --> 00:59.685
-No.
-Well, too bad.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.729
'Cause no one's here
to save you.

01:01.770 --> 01:03.188
Where's my mommy?

01:03.230 --> 01:05.941
She went shoppin'
and left me to take care of you.

01:05.983 --> 01:07.651
So now you have to play
my games.

01:07.693 --> 01:10.404
-No, I don't!
-Yes, you do!

01:18.119 --> 01:20.121
-No. No.
-Come on. Come on.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.917
-Let's go. Stop stalling.
-Where are you taking me?

01:22.958 --> 01:24.501
Don't worry about
where I'm takin' you.

01:24.543 --> 01:27.128
-I want my mommy.
-Stop cryin' for your mommy.

01:27.170 --> 01:28.881
[girl] No, no, no.

[sighs]

02:40.702 --> 02:43.204
God, does this town get smaller
every time we leave? Watch out.

02:43.246 --> 02:44.915
[Preston] Yeah.

02:44.957 --> 02:46.875
-Mom, I'm hungry.
-Okay, yeah.

02:46.917 --> 02:48.335
I know,
but grandma's making dinner,

02:48.376 --> 02:50.045
so we're gonna have
just a little snack.

02:50.087 --> 02:52.589
-A snack, Preston, okay?
-Okay.

02:52.631 --> 02:54.257
Mommy used to come here
all the time.

02:54.299 --> 02:55.300
They have the best croissant.

02:55.342 --> 02:57.469
What's a qua..
Wait, what?

02:57.511 --> 02:58.846
It's a French pastry.

02:58.887 --> 03:00.848
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

03:00.889 --> 03:02.516
-[indistinct chatter]
-[Preston gasps]

03:02.557 --> 03:05.811
Preston, one. One thing, okay?

03:05.853 --> 03:08.229
-Hi.
-Hi. Um, can I have a latte?

03:08.271 --> 03:10.524
Is that Jamie Mayfield?

03:10.565 --> 03:13.735
Oh, my God!
Bonnie? Hi.

03:13.777 --> 03:15.236
You didn't tell me
you were comin' to visit!

03:15.278 --> 03:17.531
Oh, yeah, it wasn't really
a-a planned visit.

03:17.572 --> 03:20.701
It was just...
You, wow! You look amazing.

03:20.742 --> 03:22.119
Oh, you're so sweet.

03:22.161 --> 03:24.245
Lookin' decent
is a full-time job these days.

03:24.287 --> 03:26.581
-We're not 16 anymore.
-Oh, don't I know it?

03:26.623 --> 03:30.044
-And... Oh, my God.
-Oh, Preston. Yeah, Preston.

03:30.085 --> 03:32.754
Hey, do you remember... Bonnie?

03:32.796 --> 03:34.173
Nope.

03:36.758 --> 03:39.178
I'm sorry.
We're, we're workin' on manners.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.262
-[rattling]
-Oh!

03:41.304 --> 03:43.306
[gasps]

03:43.348 --> 03:46.018
Which is obviously going
really well.

03:46.060 --> 03:48.854
Preston? Preston, hey!

03:48.896 --> 03:50.480
No.

03:50.522 --> 03:51.940
Come here.

03:53.483 --> 03:55.402
You have gotten so big, Preston.

03:55.443 --> 03:57.154
You're the big man on campus,
huh?

03:58.947 --> 04:00.490
So, what's on the agenda?

04:00.532 --> 04:02.826
Oh, um, nothing really--

04:02.868 --> 04:05.037
Oh, my God. We need to get
the girls together.

04:05.079 --> 04:06.872
Gonna be so excited
you're in town!

04:06.914 --> 04:08.331
Ah, yeah.

04:08.373 --> 04:11.334
Yeah, I'll organize it.
How's tomorrow?

04:11.376 --> 04:13.628
-Tomorrow's great.
-Amazing.

04:13.670 --> 04:15.338
It's been too long.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.757
So write it down, the men
can just go smoke cigars

04:17.798 --> 04:21.261
or watch baseball,
whatever it is they do.

04:21.302 --> 04:23.972
Um, my husband's
actually not here.

04:24.014 --> 04:26.307
Oh. Are you two...

04:26.349 --> 04:28.810
Oh, it's just a,
just another long story.

04:28.852 --> 04:31.772
Oh. Okay.
Well, um...

04:31.813 --> 04:33.732
I'm so sorry.
I should probably deal with--

04:33.774 --> 04:35.984
Oh, no, no, no, no. Go ahead.
I gotta run.

04:36.026 --> 04:37.485
-Yeah. Yeah.
-See you tomorrow? Yes?

04:37.527 --> 04:38.403
Yeah.

04:38.445 --> 04:39.780
-Mwah.
-Okay.

04:39.821 --> 04:42.157
See you,
Miss Northern California.

04:42.199 --> 04:44.034
Oh. Thank you.
Lovely to see you, Bonnie.

04:44.076 --> 04:46.286
Good to see you, too.

04:46.327 --> 04:48.080
[Jamie] I am truly sorry
for that.

04:48.122 --> 04:51.250
I will take this
and the 17 cupcakes.

04:51.291 --> 04:54.377
-Heh, okay.
-Sure, just...

04:56.046 --> 04:57.297
-There you go.
-Thank you.

04:57.338 --> 04:58.465
Yeah, have a great day.

04:58.506 --> 05:00.259
Preston. Ugh...

05:00.300 --> 05:02.677
-[Jamie gasps]
-Oh!

05:02.719 --> 05:03.971
-I'm so sorry.
-It's okay.

05:04.012 --> 05:05.513
No, it's not.
It's all over you.

05:05.555 --> 05:08.558
Let me get you some napkins.
I'm so sorry.

05:08.600 --> 05:10.393
-That funny?
-[laughing] Yes.

05:10.435 --> 05:12.312
Yeah, I guess it kinda is.

05:12.353 --> 05:14.982
-Here you go.
-No, it's okay, um--

05:15.023 --> 05:16.608
-And again, I...
-Uh...

05:16.650 --> 05:18.986
No, no. Can-can we get her
another coffee?

05:19.027 --> 05:20.403
No, look,
I was standing too close.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.322
-Honestly, it's my fault.
-No, no. No.

05:22.363 --> 05:24.199
Who are you?

05:25.700 --> 05:27.577
Whit. Who are you?

05:27.619 --> 05:31.248
Preston with the chips,
the movie.

05:31.290 --> 05:34.501
Nice to meet you,
Preston with the chips,

05:34.542 --> 05:36.377
the movie.

05:36.419 --> 05:38.005
[Preston giggling]

05:39.380 --> 05:41.258
Hey, you like baseball?

05:41.300 --> 05:42.676
I love baseball.

05:42.717 --> 05:44.678
I was a pitcher in college,
actually.

05:44.719 --> 05:47.514
You were? Well,
he was a pitcher in college!

05:47.555 --> 05:49.224
-Oh! Yeah. Here.
-Isn't that cool?

05:49.266 --> 05:52.560
-Well, thank you.
-Of course.

05:52.602 --> 05:53.979
Hey, sweetie, we gotta go, okay,

05:54.021 --> 05:57.107
because grandma's expecting us,
so...

05:57.149 --> 06:00.110
-Thank you again.
-Yeah.

06:00.152 --> 06:02.946
Hey, um, my name's Whit,
by the way.

06:02.988 --> 06:04.948
Oh. Um, Jamie.

06:04.990 --> 06:06.825
[chuckles] Spiller of coffee,

06:06.867 --> 06:09.036
mother of monster.

06:09.077 --> 06:10.829
And beauty queen.

06:11.955 --> 06:14.291
I-I heard y-y-your friend
say that

06:14.333 --> 06:16.751
you were
Miss Northern California.

06:16.793 --> 06:18.712
Yes.

06:18.753 --> 06:20.379
Not for a long time.

06:20.421 --> 06:22.090
I actually don't really like
to talk about it.

06:22.132 --> 06:24.134
It's kind of a weird curse.

06:25.760 --> 06:26.887
Okay, so we're gonna go.

06:26.928 --> 06:28.305
Uh, it was really nice
to meet you.

06:28.347 --> 06:29.806
-Oh? For, for me?
-Again.

06:29.848 --> 06:31.266
-Thank you, yeah.
-That's on us.

06:31.308 --> 06:32.433
Yeah. Got it.

06:32.475 --> 06:34.561
-Okay, Preston.
-Bye, stranger!

06:34.602 --> 06:36.146
-See you again?
-Yeah, I hope so.

06:36.188 --> 06:38.565
Okay.

06:40.108 --> 06:41.776
[chuckles]

06:55.832 --> 06:58.960
[dramatic music]

07:04.632 --> 07:06.718
-[Jamie] Buckle up!
-[engine starts]

07:30.325 --> 07:33.453
[birds chirping]

07:45.882 --> 07:48.093
[Jamie] Here we are.

07:49.219 --> 07:51.305
-[Jamie] Here they are!
-Grandma!

07:51.346 --> 07:53.307
-Hey!
-[Boone] Hey, buddy!

07:53.348 --> 07:55.350
-Look at you! Oh, that hair!
-Look how much you've grown!

07:55.392 --> 07:57.227
[Boone]
You got big like grandpa.

07:57.269 --> 07:58.686
-Hey, buddy!
-Hi, sweetheart.

07:58.728 --> 08:00.688
Look how big you are! My God!

08:00.730 --> 08:03.191
-Hey, honey.
-Hi, Daddy.

08:03.233 --> 08:06.611
I made your favorites. Macaroni
and cheese, chocolate milk.

08:06.653 --> 08:08.155
Oh, you hear that, Preston?

08:08.196 --> 08:09.990
-I'm not hungry, I--
-Yup.

08:10.031 --> 08:11.616
-Yup, yup.
-Come on in.

08:11.658 --> 08:13.452
[Boone] Don't let grandma
hear you say that.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.287
-Let's eat.
-[Preston] I ate chips.

08:15.329 --> 08:17.538
Hey, what do you say we take
your backpack up to your room?

08:17.580 --> 08:18.957
I've got some presents for you.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.584
-So glad you're here.
-[Preston] Yay, presents!

08:29.259 --> 08:31.052
It's like a time capsule
in here.

08:31.094 --> 08:35.515
[chuckles] Well, I know better
than to touch your things.

08:39.519 --> 08:43.690
Everyone is gonna be so happy
to see you.

08:43.731 --> 08:45.942
Do you know how long
you're stayin'?

08:45.984 --> 08:47.277
I don't really...

08:47.319 --> 08:50.447
You know, stay as long
as you'd like and...

09:02.792 --> 09:07.130
Well, us Mayfield girls,
we survive.

09:08.798 --> 09:10.758
Well, Casey's downstairs.

09:10.800 --> 09:14.471
So why don't you wash up
and supper'll be ready in 15?

09:37.452 --> 09:41.164
[Preston roaring]
I'm gonna eat you!

09:42.999 --> 09:45.335
[imitating roaring]

09:45.377 --> 09:46.920
You ready to eat, kiddo?

09:46.961 --> 09:48.588
I'm not hungry.

09:48.629 --> 09:50.590
Oh? Hm...

09:50.631 --> 09:53.634
Well, grandma made all this food
and we have to eat it, so...

09:53.676 --> 09:54.844
Come on.

09:54.886 --> 09:56.471
Three bites?

09:56.513 --> 09:57.931
Five bites.

09:58.306 --> 09:59.766
Fine.

10:00.767 --> 10:03.019
Well, when is daddy coming?

10:07.190 --> 10:08.483
[clears throat]

10:11.319 --> 10:15.490
-I don't know yet, sweetie.
-When are we going home?

10:15.532 --> 10:17.784
Well, we're actually gonna stay
here at grandma and grandpa's

10:17.825 --> 10:19.494
for a few days, okay,

10:19.536 --> 10:22.663
while mommy and daddy
work through some stuff.

10:22.705 --> 10:24.165
What stuff?

10:24.999 --> 10:28.169
Boring grown-up stuff. Ugh!

10:28.211 --> 10:29.921
[chuckles]

10:31.214 --> 10:33.258
But it's, it's fun
to be back here, isn't it?

10:33.300 --> 10:36.303
It's kinda nice
to be in a big house.

10:36.344 --> 10:38.388
Okay. Come on, five bites.

10:38.430 --> 10:41.308
And then you can come
and play more, okay?

10:43.184 --> 10:45.853
-Watch out for the ghost!
-[laughs] Where?

10:45.895 --> 10:50.233
Has anybody seen my really
little nephew Preston anywhere?

10:50.275 --> 10:52.402
-Oh!
-[Preston laughing]

10:52.444 --> 10:55.530
Where is he? You couldn't be
him, you're too big.

10:55.572 --> 10:56.781
Mm, I ate him.

10:56.823 --> 10:58.533
[laughs] Oh, you did?

10:58.575 --> 11:00.577
Go see your grandma.

11:00.619 --> 11:01.911
-Hi.
-Hey.

11:01.953 --> 11:03.913
Mm...

11:03.955 --> 11:05.248
How you doin'?

11:05.290 --> 11:08.251
I'm all right,
for a scorned woman.

11:08.293 --> 11:10.295
Should we kill him?

11:10.337 --> 11:12.005
Nah.

11:12.046 --> 11:14.132
Well, are you sure?

11:14.841 --> 11:15.967
Maybe his girlfriend.

11:16.009 --> 11:18.970
-Just say the word.
-[chuckles]

11:19.012 --> 11:20.679
No. It'll never last.

11:20.721 --> 11:23.266
Yeah, that is true.

11:23.308 --> 11:25.935
And I mean, I'm,
I'm really sorry it happened.

11:25.977 --> 11:27.728
But selfishly
I'm kinda glad you're here.

11:27.770 --> 11:29.814
[chuckles] Yeah,
there's no place like home

11:29.856 --> 11:30.815
to lick your wounds.

11:30.857 --> 11:32.567
Or plot murder.

11:40.033 --> 11:42.994
And then he goes, "Mr. Caroway,

11:43.036 --> 11:44.954
you can take
your triflin' business with you

11:44.996 --> 11:47.374
back to Texas
'cause here in Wine Country

11:47.415 --> 11:49.125
we've got standards!"

11:49.167 --> 11:50.709
That is not what I said!

11:50.751 --> 11:52.920
[Casey] That is exactly
what you said, Daddy.

11:52.962 --> 11:55.215
Heh. You could be in a sorority
with all that pettiness.

11:55.256 --> 11:56.966
[Bonne] I'd be
a great sorority sister.

11:57.008 --> 11:58.385
[Marlene] Hey!

11:58.426 --> 12:00.512
What do you say
when you're done?

12:00.554 --> 12:03.139
May I be excused?

12:03.181 --> 12:04.683
Yes, you may.

12:04.723 --> 12:06.809
Yes! Video games!

12:07.810 --> 12:10.855
So how you doin', kid?
How you feelin'?

12:10.897 --> 12:12.899
-I'm fine.
-Yeah.

12:12.940 --> 12:14.359
How's Rick?

12:15.776 --> 12:17.904
I don't really know.

12:17.945 --> 12:20.948
Well, maybe you guys just need
to talk it out.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.617
You know,
find some common ground.

12:22.659 --> 12:26.204
Yeah, we tried that.
Just wasn't working out.

12:27.622 --> 12:29.790
Well, marriage is hard work,
honey.

12:29.832 --> 12:31.668
-Ask your mother.
-Dad.

12:31.710 --> 12:33.086
I'm just saying,
Preston has only

12:33.127 --> 12:34.421
one father in this world.

12:34.462 --> 12:36.047
Okay, can we not, please?

12:36.089 --> 12:37.674
I've been here for five minutes.

12:37.716 --> 12:39.758
I know, I just don't want you
to throw in the towel

12:39.800 --> 12:42.011
because you hit a little bump
in the road.

12:46.140 --> 12:47.475
He cheated.

12:48.351 --> 12:50.019
Did what?

12:50.061 --> 12:53.147
Yeah, with his assistant.

12:56.234 --> 12:59.946
I'm so...
I'm sorry, Jamie.

12:59.987 --> 13:01.906
I'm sorry, that was
a big mistake on his part.

13:01.948 --> 13:04.951
Yeah, it is.
It's a big mistake.

13:04.992 --> 13:06.869
Well...

13:06.911 --> 13:09.581
Yeah, you, you just tell him
that you forgive him.

13:09.623 --> 13:11.165
Tell him that you forgive him,
and I'm sure

13:11.207 --> 13:12.751
he'll come running back
with his tail between--

13:12.791 --> 13:14.043
Dad, stop!

13:14.085 --> 13:15.670
-Just stop.
-What?

13:15.712 --> 13:18.172
I just mean...

13:18.214 --> 13:19.674
to forgive is divine.

13:19.716 --> 13:21.593
-[scoffs] Oh, my God!
-Jamie...

13:21.635 --> 13:23.428
-Everybody makes mistakes.
-No, I'm done, I'm done!

13:23.470 --> 13:24.971
[Boone]
Everybody makes mistakes, Jamie!

13:25.012 --> 13:26.640
-Jamie?
-Dad?

13:26.681 --> 13:28.015
Jamie?

13:28.767 --> 13:30.477
Seriously?

13:35.398 --> 13:38.568
[crickets chirping]

13:41.404 --> 13:44.616
[instrumental music]

13:54.250 --> 13:55.710
[man] Jamie?

13:57.712 --> 14:00.423
[dramatic music]

14:00.465 --> 14:01.924
[man] Jamie?

14:05.136 --> 14:08.348
[eerie music]

14:10.809 --> 14:12.101
Dad?

14:14.103 --> 14:16.648
-Daddy! Dad!
-Jamie, what is it?

14:16.690 --> 14:18.316
Jamie? What?

14:18.358 --> 14:20.234
There's somebody out there.
There's somebody out there.

14:20.276 --> 14:21.695
-What? Where?
-There's a man outside!

14:21.736 --> 14:23.530
-Look! Look, there's a man.
-Where?

14:23.571 --> 14:24.864
-[Boone] Where?
-[Jamie] Th...

14:24.905 --> 14:26.157
-Where am I looking?
-There was a...

14:26.199 --> 14:27.450
-I swear there was a guy.
-Okay.

14:27.492 --> 14:29.243
Look, Jamie, Jamie, honey.

14:29.285 --> 14:31.496
-Here you are. It's okay.
-[Jamie breathing heavily]

14:31.538 --> 14:34.499
It's okay. Shh... It's okay.

14:34.541 --> 14:37.210
You are safe here, I promise.

14:38.127 --> 14:42.215
-I'm sorry.
-No, don't be sorry.

14:42.256 --> 14:45.844
Okay.
Come on. Let's get you in bed.

14:47.178 --> 14:48.929
And you can sleep in

14:48.971 --> 14:52.016
because your mom and I
will take care of Preston.

14:56.688 --> 14:59.816
-No sugary cereals, right?
-Of course not.

15:03.820 --> 15:05.946
Jamie, I'm sorry about tonight.

15:05.988 --> 15:09.409
It was insensitive and selfish.

15:10.451 --> 15:11.994
Thanks, Daddy.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.915
All right.

15:15.956 --> 15:18.376
Get some sleep, it's late.

15:18.418 --> 15:20.587
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

15:21.462 --> 15:24.674
[instrumental music]

15:32.432 --> 15:35.309
[eerie music]

15:35.351 --> 15:36.936
[laughing]

15:43.777 --> 15:46.738
[doorknob rattling]

16:00.334 --> 16:02.211
[girl screaming]

16:05.298 --> 16:08.509
[breathing heavily]

16:26.820 --> 16:30.030
[crickets chirping]

16:30.698 --> 16:32.074
Hi.

16:33.284 --> 16:35.829
-Mind if I join you?
-Come on.

16:40.500 --> 16:42.084
[Jamie sighs]

16:42.126 --> 16:44.253
Well, you're up late.

16:46.756 --> 16:49.509
Don't sleep too much
these days.

16:52.595 --> 16:54.138
You okay?

16:55.014 --> 16:57.767
Yeah. Just had a bad dream.

16:59.644 --> 17:01.646
You still have those, huh?

17:07.568 --> 17:10.154
So what do you wanna do
while you're here?

17:11.113 --> 17:12.406
Well, tomorrow
I'm having breakfast

17:12.448 --> 17:13.782
with some old girlfriends.

17:13.825 --> 17:16.410
Oh. Well...

17:16.452 --> 17:19.622
I would like
to have my time with you.

17:19.664 --> 17:21.248
And so would your sister.

17:22.249 --> 17:23.710
Yeah?

17:24.335 --> 17:27.296
She misses you.

17:27.338 --> 17:31.384
She always seems so busy
with her company and everything.

17:31.425 --> 17:34.136
Honey, you two used to be
so close.

17:34.178 --> 17:36.430
-Like two peas in a pod.
-Two peas in a pod.

17:36.472 --> 17:37.974
Yes.

17:39.767 --> 17:42.729
I just don't want you two
to have a strained relationship

17:42.770 --> 17:44.939
like my sisters and I.

17:44.981 --> 17:47.984
Competitive and petty.

17:48.026 --> 17:50.611
Going years without speaking.

17:51.738 --> 17:53.907
You know, it's sad, really.

17:55.199 --> 18:00.204
Most important thing is kin,
you know?

18:01.831 --> 18:04.959
You could give Aunt Maddy
and Auntie Loretta a call.

18:07.127 --> 18:08.588
No.

18:08.629 --> 18:11.507
No, no, no. No.

18:11.549 --> 18:14.093
They can call me.

18:23.310 --> 18:26.439
[dramatic music]

18:46.876 --> 18:49.796
[birds chirping]

18:59.430 --> 19:02.767
-Oh, my God. I am so sorry.
-Oh, man.

19:05.061 --> 19:07.063
You know, I wouldn't drink
out of these if I were you.

19:07.105 --> 19:09.148
Oh, yeah, I wasn't, I...

19:13.611 --> 19:15.029
Oh, no, not you.

19:15.071 --> 19:18.407
No, I just mean that
it's the second time in two days

19:18.449 --> 19:21.577
that I have made myself
look like a walking disaster.

19:21.619 --> 19:24.163
No, no!
It was an accident, come on.

19:24.204 --> 19:27.333
Uh, these things are made
with Bisphenol A and Phthalates.

19:27.374 --> 19:30.586
Big Industry created things
to cause cancer, birth defects.

19:30.628 --> 19:33.297
-You name it.
-Oh.

19:33.339 --> 19:36.509
Well, I was not actually
going to buy one of those,

19:36.550 --> 19:39.804
but that is very good
information, so thank you.

19:39.846 --> 19:43.099
Uh, where are you headed?

19:43.141 --> 19:44.684
Uh, just down the street.

19:44.725 --> 19:47.895
I'm gonna catch up with
some old high-school friends.

19:49.063 --> 19:51.732
Mind if I walk with you?

19:51.774 --> 19:52.775
No, not at all.

19:52.817 --> 19:56.029
-Great.
-[chuckles]

19:56.988 --> 19:58.781
So what brings you into town?

19:58.823 --> 20:00.741
I grew up here...

20:00.783 --> 20:04.328
and I'm just visiting parents.

20:04.370 --> 20:05.913
Well, welcome back.

20:07.581 --> 20:10.001
-Uh, where are you from?
-San Francisco.

20:10.043 --> 20:13.504
Oh, I love San Francisco.
I have family there.

20:13.546 --> 20:16.132
My parents,
they used to take us to, uh,

20:16.174 --> 20:17.758
The Cameo to see old movies.

20:17.800 --> 20:21.512
-I love The Cameo.
-Yeah, it's great.

20:21.554 --> 20:23.973
So, uh, what brings you here?

20:24.015 --> 20:25.850
I'm getting my law degree
at Berkeley.

20:25.892 --> 20:29.269
I took a few years off,
traveled around...

20:29.311 --> 20:31.522
International man.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.691
-Where to?
-All over.

20:33.733 --> 20:37.277
I had a goal, I wanted to hit
all seven continents in a year.

20:37.319 --> 20:39.197
-Did you make your goal?
-I did.

20:39.238 --> 20:41.741
[chuckles] Wow!

20:41.782 --> 20:44.410
So what was your favorite place
to go visit?

20:44.451 --> 20:46.871
Africa. It's incredible.

20:46.913 --> 20:50.833
Tanzania, Morocco, Namibia.

20:50.875 --> 20:53.753
Yeah, Africa would be amazing.

20:53.794 --> 20:55.462
It is.

20:55.504 --> 20:59.967
-But there's no place like home.
-Yeah.

21:00.009 --> 21:01.886
You know, Jamie,
you know, I was worried

21:01.928 --> 21:04.680
I wasn't gonna see you again
and I don't want to leave it up

21:04.722 --> 21:07.683
to chance a second time,
I apologize if this is forward,

21:07.725 --> 21:11.854
but I would love
to take you out to dinner.

21:11.896 --> 21:15.441
-Oh, um...
-I know this great steakhouse.

21:15.482 --> 21:17.568
Coleman's?

21:17.610 --> 21:20.238
Right. You grew up here.

21:20.279 --> 21:21.572
Yeah.

21:23.032 --> 21:24.491
Sure.

21:25.076 --> 21:27.161
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

21:29.747 --> 21:30.957
This is me.

21:30.998 --> 21:34.752
Okay, uh,
how about Friday at 7 p.m.?

21:34.794 --> 21:38.131
-That sounds good.
-Great. It's a date.

21:38.172 --> 21:40.258
O-or d-dinner, whatever.

21:40.299 --> 21:42.969
-[chuckling]
-Can I pick you up?

21:43.010 --> 21:45.221
[laughs] Yeah, my parents...

21:45.263 --> 21:48.891
Uh, it's the big blue house
at Euclid and 15th.

21:53.229 --> 21:55.982
-Come on.
-[chuckles]

21:58.276 --> 22:00.527
Be careful of those girls.

22:00.569 --> 22:01.904
My old high-school friends?

22:01.946 --> 22:05.116
Yeah.
Old friends can be so catty.

22:05.158 --> 22:07.660
Ugh! Tell me about it.

22:16.585 --> 22:17.586
[Alice] Are you kidding?

22:17.628 --> 22:18.587
If Margie were to leave,

22:18.629 --> 22:19.880
my husband just wouldn't eat.

22:19.922 --> 22:21.048
He'd die before he'd figure out

22:21.090 --> 22:22.424
how to bake a chicken.

22:22.466 --> 22:24.969
I'll have you know,
I taught Marcus well.

22:25.011 --> 22:26.137
He knows how to boil an egg.

22:26.179 --> 22:28.139
[all laughing]

22:28.181 --> 22:31.142
So spill it, Jamie.
Tell us everything.

22:31.184 --> 22:33.602
[Dixie] So after Berkeley,
you guys moved to Albuquerque...

22:33.644 --> 22:36.147
Oh, my God, I, when I heard,
I said there's no way

22:36.189 --> 22:39.441
Ms. Jamie Mayfield
last a year in the desert.

22:39.483 --> 22:40.985
Why would you say that?

22:41.027 --> 22:42.862
Just because... Come on.

22:42.903 --> 22:44.404
You're the queen of California.

22:44.446 --> 22:46.448
There's nothing for you
in dusty New Mexico.

22:46.490 --> 22:47.700
Well, it's not that bad.

22:47.741 --> 22:49.285
We all thought
you'd move to Hollywood

22:49.327 --> 22:50.703
and be this big movie star.

22:50.744 --> 22:53.371
Marry a ball player
at the very least!

22:54.999 --> 22:58.376
You know, I moved to Albuquerque
for him and he just...

22:58.418 --> 23:00.087
It was like he was never happy,
you know,

23:00.129 --> 23:01.588
I never felt like I was enough.

23:01.630 --> 23:03.049
Oh, I completely understand

23:03.090 --> 23:06.886
about not feeling appreciated,
et cetera...

23:06.927 --> 23:09.305
You know,
sometimes I just need to cuddle.

23:09.347 --> 23:12.975
-What, Barry doesn't cuddle?
-All right.

23:13.017 --> 23:14.476
Um, I understand

23:14.518 --> 23:16.770
if you don't wanna
talk about it, no pressure.

23:16.812 --> 23:19.523
But what's going on with Rick?

23:22.693 --> 23:25.487
-Um, we're getting a divorce.
-[all] Aww!

23:25.529 --> 23:28.241
[Jamie] Yeah,
it's just not working out.

23:28.282 --> 23:30.284
He was having an affair
with his 21-year-old assistant.

23:30.326 --> 23:32.912
-What?
-Who does he think he is?

23:32.953 --> 23:34.788
-Does he know who you are?
-Apparently...

23:34.830 --> 23:36.040
I'm not much of anybody.

23:36.082 --> 23:39.001
Okay, you are
Jamie freakin' Mayfields.

23:39.043 --> 23:41.170
That's right.
Good riddance!

23:41.212 --> 23:44.590
Well, good, then let's find
Jamie Mayfield a real man.

23:44.631 --> 23:47.634
I got the perfect man for you.
He's gorgeous, rich--

23:47.676 --> 23:48.844
Oh, no, you need to meet
my doctor.

23:48.886 --> 23:51.097
I cannot believe
he's still single.

23:51.138 --> 23:53.266
I mean, if I were still single,
I'd be faking an illness

23:53.307 --> 23:54.350
every other week.

23:54.392 --> 23:57.228
[all laughing]

24:05.278 --> 24:08.406
[dramatic music]

24:33.055 --> 24:35.724
[music continues]

24:38.144 --> 24:39.645
[Marlene sighs]

24:41.188 --> 24:42.856
Who are you going out with
tonight?

24:42.898 --> 24:45.734
I told you, mama.
I met him at the coffee shop.

24:45.776 --> 24:48.695
Well, does he have a name?

24:48.737 --> 24:52.032
-Yes, Guy From Coffee Shop.
-Oh...

24:53.575 --> 24:56.078
Preston, come say goodnight
to your mama!

24:56.120 --> 24:57.788
Oh, hello, mama.
Yeah, you still got it.

24:57.830 --> 25:00.124
-Oh, yeah? Thank you.
-Yeah, you look great.

25:00.166 --> 25:01.459
Thanks.

25:02.542 --> 25:03.752
[Marlene] Preston?

25:03.794 --> 25:05.796
Someone's coming down
the driveway.

25:05.838 --> 25:07.673
Oh, great. Must be him.

25:07.714 --> 25:09.507
Mm...

25:09.549 --> 25:10.884
-Oh.
-Oh.

25:10.926 --> 25:12.761
-Good Lord, child.
-Preston.

25:12.803 --> 25:15.055
-What have you gotten into?
-Hah.

25:15.097 --> 25:17.266
I told you,
no sugar after five o'clock.

25:17.308 --> 25:20.353
-No wonder he can't sleep.
-Come here. Oh, my God.

25:20.394 --> 25:23.814
But my bedtime's, like,
I don't know...

25:23.856 --> 25:25.983
-Like 9:00?
-In, like, an hour?

25:26.025 --> 25:27.525
-Yeah.
-[whines]

25:27.567 --> 25:29.195
Hey. I love you.

25:29.236 --> 25:31.947
Be good. Yeah?

25:31.989 --> 25:33.531
So is he gonna come inside,

25:33.573 --> 25:35.034
meet your parents
like a gentleman?

25:35.075 --> 25:38.037
Hm, no, 'cause I'm not 16
anymore, Daddy.

25:38.078 --> 25:40.538
-Oh.
-[chuckles]

25:40.580 --> 25:42.249
Okay. Love you, guys. Goodnight!

25:42.291 --> 25:44.335
-You two be careful.
-Be safe!

25:44.751 --> 25:46.504
[Casey] Bye!

25:47.754 --> 25:50.883
[Whit] Hey. You look great.

25:50.924 --> 25:53.344
[Jamie] Oh! Thanks.

25:53.386 --> 25:55.929
[chuckles] Gentleman.

25:58.098 --> 25:59.933
Go, go, go!

26:01.601 --> 26:04.480
[instrumental music]

26:04.522 --> 26:05.939
[Boone] I don't like him.

26:05.981 --> 26:08.566
[Marlene] Come on now,
you don't even know him.

26:09.151 --> 26:10.528
[engine starts]

26:10.568 --> 26:12.863
[Casey] Jamie said
he was a polite gentleman.

26:19.078 --> 26:21.330
[Whit] And so there I was,
I was swimming,

26:21.372 --> 26:22.915
relaxing in the Orinoco River,

26:22.956 --> 26:25.042
when I noticed this group
of people on the shore.

26:25.084 --> 26:27.127
They're-they're waving their
hands, and trying to signal me

26:27.169 --> 26:28.837
and they're screaming,
and I'm thinking,

26:28.879 --> 26:30.089
"What's-what's happenin' here?"

26:30.130 --> 26:33.967
And then I feel it,
small sharp bites.

26:34.009 --> 26:35.719
[Jamie] What? Like, jellyfish?

26:35.761 --> 26:37.471
No, I wish! Piranhas!

26:37.513 --> 26:39.597
I swam into the middle
of a feeding frenzy.

26:39.639 --> 26:42.684
-No! What did you do?
-I swam back as fast as I could.

26:42.726 --> 26:44.019
Screaming the entire way.

26:44.061 --> 26:46.980
-Oh, thank you.
-[man] You're welcome.

26:47.022 --> 26:48.774
-Excuse me?
-[man] Yes?

26:48.815 --> 26:52.027
Um, can, can we get another set
of glasses, please?

26:52.069 --> 26:53.611
-[man] Certainly.
-Hand-washed, preferably.

26:53.653 --> 26:54.988
If it's not
too much of a hassle.

26:55.030 --> 26:57.575
[man] Right away, sir.

26:57.615 --> 27:00.869
The majority of restaurant
dishwashers contain Exophiala.

27:00.911 --> 27:04.206
It's linked to all sorts of
lung and skin problems and...

27:04.248 --> 27:07.084
Uh, I'm coming off crazy,
aren't I?

27:07.126 --> 27:08.544
[giggles] No, you're fine.

27:08.586 --> 27:10.879
Normally, I'm not this much
of a germaphobe,

27:10.921 --> 27:13.424
but I'd just feel terrible
if you got sick on my watch.

27:13.466 --> 27:15.050
[Jamie chuckles]

27:15.092 --> 27:17.928
Well, I really appreciate that.

27:17.970 --> 27:20.847
I have been talking about myself
this entire time--

27:20.889 --> 27:23.476
[laughs] I love your stories,
though. That's like...

27:23.517 --> 27:26.520
It's like listening
to an adventure novel on tape.

27:26.562 --> 27:28.188
<i>Robinson Crusoe</i> or something.

27:28.230 --> 27:30.149
No, no, no.
Please, tell me about yourself.

27:30.190 --> 27:32.568
Uh, uh, what's it like
bein' back home?

27:32.610 --> 27:35.779
It's...
interesting.

27:35.821 --> 27:37.364
I feel like
I'm back in high school,

27:37.406 --> 27:40.742
although I'm obviously
not back in high school.

27:40.784 --> 27:42.786
What were you like back then?

27:42.828 --> 27:45.080
[chuckles] Um, well,
the first couple of years

27:45.122 --> 27:49.001
I was really social.
I did pageants.

27:51.086 --> 27:55.174
And the second couple of years?

27:55.215 --> 27:57.593
-Those were different.
-Well...

27:57.635 --> 27:59.845
-Hand washed.
-Thanks.

28:02.556 --> 28:04.724
I feel like
there's a story here.

28:04.766 --> 28:07.603
Yeah, I'm gonna need
all the wine.

28:11.315 --> 28:12.566
Why am I gonna tell you this?

28:12.608 --> 28:14.985
[Jamie chuckles]

28:15.027 --> 28:18.489
Oh, man. Why am I smiling?
It's really not funny.

28:18.531 --> 28:19.990
Um...

28:23.202 --> 28:25.329
Um, okay, so...

28:25.371 --> 28:28.290
after I won
Miss Northern California...

28:28.332 --> 28:31.418
[clears throat] I had to do all
these appearances and events.

28:31.460 --> 28:34.505
I-I started noticing
that this one guy

28:34.547 --> 28:37.257
would just show up
to all of them.

28:37.299 --> 28:41.679
And then I started seeing him,
um, outside of school

28:41.720 --> 28:44.515
and at the gym...

28:46.099 --> 28:50.020
And then, eventually,
outside my home.

28:50.062 --> 28:52.606
My parents thought
that I was making it up,

28:52.648 --> 28:54.900
um, until he started sending me
stuff in the mail,

28:54.941 --> 28:56.694
like gifts and letters.

28:56.735 --> 28:59.154
It started off innocent
at first, I guess,

28:59.196 --> 29:01.407
but, um, it got really...

29:03.033 --> 29:05.202
really scary.

29:05.244 --> 29:06.953
Anyway,
my parents finally got it,

29:06.995 --> 29:09.873
and, uh, we filed
a restraining order

29:09.915 --> 29:11.917
and that was it.

29:11.958 --> 29:14.044
But I couldn't help feeling, um,

29:14.086 --> 29:16.880
you know, exposed.

29:18.465 --> 29:21.510
What happened to him,
the stalker?

29:23.512 --> 29:25.264
He was murdered.

29:25.847 --> 29:27.349
Murdered?

29:30.060 --> 29:32.563
I guess
he got what he deserved.

29:32.605 --> 29:34.981
Yeah, I don't know
if he deserved to die,

29:35.023 --> 29:37.735
but, um, I'd be lying if I said

29:37.776 --> 29:40.446
I didn't wish that upon him
sometimes.

29:41.280 --> 29:44.157
[dramatic music]

29:44.199 --> 29:45.701
Are you okay?

29:47.202 --> 29:48.454
Yeah. Yeah. Uh...

29:48.495 --> 29:50.623
[clears throat] Sorry.

29:51.873 --> 29:54.084
Oh, no, um...

29:54.126 --> 29:57.296
Maybe let's move on,
talk about something else.

29:57.337 --> 29:58.964
Of course, so...

29:59.005 --> 30:00.633
[clears throat]

30:00.674 --> 30:02.134
Where were you
before you were here?

30:02.175 --> 30:05.262
Mm, Albuquerque.

30:06.764 --> 30:08.557
What brought you there?

30:10.016 --> 30:11.977
My, uh, my husband.

30:12.894 --> 30:15.564
I'm sorry for the bomb drop.

30:15.606 --> 30:17.566
Do I look phased?

30:18.108 --> 30:20.026
No. You don't.

30:20.068 --> 30:23.822
But for the record,
we are separated, hence.

30:24.448 --> 30:26.659
His loss, my gain.

30:30.412 --> 30:33.248
So what about you?
You ever been married?

30:35.041 --> 30:37.210
I was close. Engaged.

30:38.504 --> 30:41.340
-[cell phone rings]
-Oh, my God, that is so loud.

30:41.381 --> 30:43.342
I'm so sorry,
I thought I turned that off.

30:43.383 --> 30:46.428
[dramatic music]

30:47.721 --> 30:49.765
It was him, wasn't it?

30:52.017 --> 30:53.519
It's all right.

30:54.436 --> 30:56.814
What do you say
we get out of here

30:56.855 --> 30:59.065
and go someplace more private?

31:00.693 --> 31:02.861
I say that's a good idea.

31:05.280 --> 31:06.865
Check, please.

31:08.534 --> 31:11.704
[music continues]

31:15.207 --> 31:16.667
[Whit] It's beautiful up here,
isn't it?

31:16.709 --> 31:18.836
It is, yeah, I used to come
here as a kid.

31:18.877 --> 31:20.295
Yeah, but it's been a while

31:20.337 --> 31:23.298
'cause, you know, well,
as I...

31:23.340 --> 31:26.926
[Whit] Very well. Here we are.

31:33.392 --> 31:36.603
[instrumental music]

31:49.074 --> 31:51.076
The view is beautiful.

31:52.411 --> 31:53.829
[Jamie chuckles]

32:00.711 --> 32:04.130
I want to thank you for being
so open with me earlier.

32:04.172 --> 32:05.841
About your past.

32:05.883 --> 32:08.594
I'm sure that wasn't easy.

32:08.635 --> 32:11.597
Well, I think
honesty is really important.

32:12.556 --> 32:14.182
So do I.

32:18.687 --> 32:20.647
Uh, Jamie, uh...

32:21.523 --> 32:23.734
I have to tell you something.

32:25.193 --> 32:26.820
I'm just...

32:27.987 --> 32:30.198
I'm just a little nervous.

32:31.825 --> 32:35.412
Well, it's okay.
You can trust me.

32:35.454 --> 32:38.331
I wasn't traveling for pleasure
all those years.

32:39.583 --> 32:41.167
Okay.

32:42.085 --> 32:43.754
I was in the CIA.

32:45.631 --> 32:47.090
Whoa!

32:49.008 --> 32:50.385
Really?

32:52.387 --> 32:55.682
-Are you still?
-No, no.

32:55.724 --> 32:59.269
About a year ago
I told them I wanted out.

32:59.311 --> 33:00.854
You know, I just wanted
to get my law degree,

33:00.896 --> 33:04.733
I wanted to start my life
over again. I just...

33:04.775 --> 33:07.945
And they, you know, they let me,
that just did not happen.

33:10.238 --> 33:12.616
They're monitoring me, Jamie.

33:12.658 --> 33:14.868
When you become an agent, you,

33:14.910 --> 33:17.120
you learn sensitive information.

33:17.162 --> 33:21.500
I'm sorry. I'm sorry
I wasn't honest with you.

33:21.541 --> 33:25.879
It's just, when I met you,
I, I felt this-this, this pull

33:25.921 --> 33:29.132
that I haven't felt
in a really long time.

33:29.174 --> 33:32.845
[chuckles] I understand
if this freaks you out.

33:32.886 --> 33:35.973
No. No, it doesn't.

33:37.766 --> 33:39.267
You make me feel safe.

33:43.772 --> 33:46.984
[instrumental music]

34:16.054 --> 34:17.723
[Rick] Jamie.

34:19.808 --> 34:21.518
-Rick, what are you doing here?
-[Rick] Where have you been?

34:21.560 --> 34:24.312
I've been calling you.
I left you a million messages.

34:24.353 --> 34:26.356
How did you even get in here?

34:26.398 --> 34:28.734
-Your father let me in.
-[scoffs] Oh, my God.

34:28.775 --> 34:30.150
Of course he did.

34:30.193 --> 34:32.987
Jamie, I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

34:33.030 --> 34:34.907
How many times do I have
to say it for everything?

34:34.947 --> 34:37.034
Okay, but Preston is my son.

34:37.074 --> 34:38.534
You don't have the right
to keep him from me.

34:38.577 --> 34:41.246
I'm not trying
to keep P-Preston from you.

34:41.286 --> 34:44.290
I-I just need space to think.

34:44.331 --> 34:47.168
I know that you think
that I left you, but I didn't.

34:47.210 --> 34:49.838
The truth is,
you left me years ago, you did.

34:49.880 --> 34:51.797
Maybe not physically,
but emotionally.

34:51.840 --> 34:55.134
Okay, wow. So this is my fault?

34:55.176 --> 34:56.553
I mean, most days
I was convinced

34:56.594 --> 34:57.846
that you didn't even like me,

34:57.888 --> 34:59.097
let alone respect me and hear me

34:59.138 --> 35:00.724
out on this,
so why bother, right?

35:00.766 --> 35:02.350
Okay, so you sleep
with your assistant

35:02.392 --> 35:04.227
because that's the best way
to earn my respect.

35:04.269 --> 35:06.730
I did not sleep
with my assistant.

35:06.772 --> 35:08.732
Rick, you are lying!

35:08.774 --> 35:11.150
Jamie, you have to believe me.

35:11.192 --> 35:12.360
-I have proof!
-You have proof?

35:12.402 --> 35:14.071
-Yeah! Yes!
-Really?

35:14.112 --> 35:15.447
Okay, well, show me the proof,

35:15.488 --> 35:16.656
because it didn't happen,

35:16.698 --> 35:18.992
so you can't.

35:19.034 --> 35:21.369
-Okay. Really? You're done?
-Yes!

35:21.411 --> 35:23.204
[Jamie] Please go.

35:24.372 --> 35:25.582
[scoffs]

35:36.051 --> 35:39.137
Why did you let Rick inside?

35:39.178 --> 35:42.348
What would you have
wanted us to do, Jamie?

35:43.934 --> 35:46.686
Um, stay out of it, Dad.

35:46.728 --> 35:48.647
I can take care
of my own problems.

35:48.688 --> 35:52.818
Sweetheart, your father
was just trying to help.

35:52.859 --> 35:57.489
-Goodnight.
-I should get going, too.

35:57.530 --> 35:58.991
[Marlene] I think you should go
talk to her.

35:59.032 --> 36:01.284
[Casey] Mom, she needs time.
Okay?

36:01.326 --> 36:02.744
She found out her husband's
cheating on her

36:02.786 --> 36:04.788
and she's been here,
like, a week.

36:04.830 --> 36:08.041
-So, give her some space.
-She's gonna be okay, honey.

36:08.083 --> 36:10.961
Maybe they just really need
some time apart.

36:11.003 --> 36:12.337
No, Dad, she's better off alone

36:12.378 --> 36:14.255
than with a cheatin' husband.
Okay?

36:14.297 --> 36:16.800
[Boone] All I'm saying is I hope
he comes back a changed man.

36:16.842 --> 36:19.719
[Casey] Daddy, once a cheater,
always a cheater.

36:19.761 --> 36:21.471
Mom, tell him.

36:21.513 --> 36:23.140
Well...

36:23.181 --> 36:25.142
Hey, one of you finish
that bottle of wine, okay?

36:25.183 --> 36:27.185
It's a nice one,
I opened it, sorry.

36:45.078 --> 36:48.206
[dramatic music]

36:58.216 --> 37:00.259
-Hey.
-Oh!

37:01.511 --> 37:03.096
Aw...

37:03.138 --> 37:05.807
-Thank you for coming.
-Of course.

37:10.228 --> 37:13.356
Ah. I just...

37:13.398 --> 37:14.649
I needed to get out
of that house.

37:14.691 --> 37:16.985
Yeah? You okay?
You seem stressed.

37:17.027 --> 37:21.656
[sighs] It's stuff
with my husband. My ex.

37:21.698 --> 37:23.366
Hey, whatever happened
to your ex,

37:23.408 --> 37:24.409
the one you were engaged to?

37:24.450 --> 37:27.579
Oh. Well, that's a long story.

37:27.620 --> 37:30.999
Basically, she didn't support
the work I was doing.

37:31.041 --> 37:33.877
She wanted a normal life,
which is understandable,

37:33.919 --> 37:37.130
but at that point it wasn't
something I could give her.

37:38.215 --> 37:39.966
So what's goin' on with your ex?

37:42.343 --> 37:43.636
When you dropped me off
yesterday,

37:43.678 --> 37:45.972
he was there waiting for me.

37:47.682 --> 37:49.392
He claims he didn't cheat.

37:49.434 --> 37:51.603
-You have proof though, right?
-Yes.

37:51.644 --> 37:53.230
Then what's wrong?

37:54.647 --> 37:57.817
I'm worried that he might go
for full custody of Preston.

37:57.859 --> 38:00.070
You're his mother. A judge will
always decide in your favor.

38:00.112 --> 38:02.572
Nope, the truth is,

38:02.614 --> 38:04.950
if we went to court,
he might win.

38:04.991 --> 38:07.326
Why? Why would he win?

38:07.368 --> 38:09.204
Because I don't have a job.

38:09.246 --> 38:11.998
He owns the business, he owns
the house, I mean, on paper

38:12.040 --> 38:14.459
he may look like a much more
fit parent than I do.

38:14.500 --> 38:16.002
What's on paper
isn't everything.

38:16.044 --> 38:17.045
I... You know, I'm...

38:17.087 --> 38:18.088
I feel like I'm crumbling

38:18.130 --> 38:19.839
under all the pressure, I...

38:19.881 --> 38:21.507
I feel like
I'm failing as a mother.

38:21.549 --> 38:23.218
Jamie, I know we've only

38:23.260 --> 38:24.552
known each other
for a little bit,

38:24.594 --> 38:25.511
but Preston is lucky

38:25.553 --> 38:28.056
to have a mother like you.

38:28.098 --> 38:32.811
I'm trying. I am trying
to be level-headed about it.

38:32.852 --> 38:34.771
But I just keep thinking about
how he brought

38:34.813 --> 38:37.565
that woman around Preston.

38:37.607 --> 38:41.111
-That's confusing for a child.
-It is, yeah.

38:42.195 --> 38:43.404
But it's not all about Preston.

38:43.446 --> 38:46.699
I mean, if I'm being honest,

38:46.741 --> 38:49.410
it's also about my bruised ego.

38:50.328 --> 38:53.539
Or heart. Or both.

38:54.749 --> 38:57.919
-What's his name?
-Rick.

38:58.670 --> 39:00.046
Richard Thompson.

39:00.088 --> 39:02.757
Well, mind if I do
a little checking of my own?

39:02.799 --> 39:05.426
Yeah, that's fine,
just don't tell me

39:05.468 --> 39:08.888
if you find out
about other women, okay?

39:08.930 --> 39:10.348
I won't.

39:17.856 --> 39:20.733
Jamie, I care about you.

39:20.775 --> 39:21.693
[Jamie chuckles]

39:21.734 --> 39:23.278
[Whit] A lot.

39:27.573 --> 39:29.951
I won't let anything happen
to you.

39:36.708 --> 39:38.918
What's wrong?

39:38.960 --> 39:41.462
-Nothing.
-Then don't stop.

39:43.048 --> 39:46.634
Mm, I'm sorry. I'm just
so worried about Preston.

39:46.676 --> 39:49.387
Of course.
He's your number-one priority.

39:49.428 --> 39:51.931
That says a lot about you.

39:51.973 --> 39:54.351
Well, thank you
for understanding.

39:55.894 --> 39:58.063
Um, can I see you again soon?

39:58.104 --> 39:59.731
-The sooner the better.
-[chuckles]

39:59.772 --> 40:02.108
Okay, then, I'll call you.

40:03.401 --> 40:06.612

40:48.238 --> 40:50.282
[man] <i> Yes? Inquiry department.</i>
[Whit] Yeah.

40:50.323 --> 40:52.158
<i>Oh, we just want to confirm</i>
<i>the name.</i>

40:52.200 --> 40:55.954
-Name is Richard Thompson.
<i>-Richard Thompson of Sonoma?</i>

40:55.995 --> 40:57.789
-Yup.
<i>-Affirmative.</i>

40:57.830 --> 40:59.791
<i>You'll need level-two clearance</i>
<i>to enter database.</i>

40:59.832 --> 41:01.126
Okay, thanks.

41:01.167 --> 41:04.379

[chuckles]

41:44.502 --> 41:45.878
[sighs]

41:45.920 --> 41:47.839
[man] Jamie?

41:49.424 --> 41:52.635
[eerie music]

42:04.105 --> 42:05.523
[gasps]

42:09.986 --> 42:11.612
[Preston laughing]

42:11.654 --> 42:13.531
Ah, you're gonna hurt his back.

42:14.324 --> 42:17.118
[Boone laughing]

42:17.160 --> 42:19.287
[Marlene]
All right. Time to go in.

42:19.329 --> 42:21.539
[indistinct chatter]

42:21.580 --> 42:24.292
-I'll come back.
-Aw...

42:24.334 --> 42:25.877
[Preston] You come on!

42:29.506 --> 42:31.883
That boy is gonna kill me.

42:31.924 --> 42:34.969
[chuckles] Not if the heat
kills you first!

42:36.971 --> 42:40.099
-Oh! Thank you.
-[Preston] Grandma, come on!

42:40.141 --> 42:42.810
-[Bonne] Come on!
-Come on, you're no fun!

42:43.602 --> 42:45.355
Mm...

42:46.814 --> 42:50.151
You've been spending a lot
of time with that young man.

42:50.193 --> 42:53.112
[chuckles] Well...

42:53.154 --> 42:56.449
He is smart, interesting...

42:57.409 --> 43:00.119
and really honest, for a change.

43:00.161 --> 43:01.829
Honest is good.

43:01.871 --> 43:05.124
I don't know, there's something
really familiar about him.

43:05.166 --> 43:07.585
Like I've known him
my whole life or something.

43:07.626 --> 43:09.087
I know that sounds <i> cliche.</i>

43:09.128 --> 43:11.964
No, it all sounds good.

43:12.006 --> 43:14.426
I just hope you know that...

43:15.676 --> 43:18.263
You don't have to rush it,
Jamie.

43:20.473 --> 43:21.766
Okay.

43:22.683 --> 43:24.894
-You sure?
-Oh, I'm sure.

43:24.936 --> 43:27.105
[Preston] Grandma!
Grandma, come on!

43:27.146 --> 43:28.981
-Mm.
-Not fun without you!

43:29.023 --> 43:31.650
-I'm back in.
-[Boone] Come on, come on!

43:31.692 --> 43:34.070
[cell phone vibrates]

44:08.229 --> 44:09.564
Hey.

44:13.485 --> 44:14.735
Hi.

44:15.736 --> 44:17.280
Something wrong?

44:18.615 --> 44:21.033
I just, I feel like
I've been here before.

44:21.075 --> 44:23.495
-Is this a family home?
-No.

44:23.536 --> 44:24.996
No. I-I mean, it's not mine.

44:25.037 --> 44:26.038
I bought this about a year ago

44:26.080 --> 44:27.123
from this old lady

44:27.165 --> 44:28.583
just before she passed.

44:28.625 --> 44:30.251
I don't know,
maybe your parents knew her

44:30.293 --> 44:33.254
and they brought you here
when you were little.

44:33.296 --> 44:36.048
Yeah, maybe that's it.

44:36.090 --> 44:39.469
Yeah, it needs some work, but
I'm, I'm gettin' around to it.

44:40.553 --> 44:42.180
Come inside.

44:45.266 --> 44:47.185
I'm happy to see you.

44:47.226 --> 44:49.270
Happy to see you, too.

44:54.233 --> 44:55.776
I was just finishing
something up.

44:55.818 --> 44:58.196
-I'll be right back.
-Uh-huh.

45:18.633 --> 45:21.219
You said you had something
you wanted to talk to me about.

45:23.971 --> 45:26.140
I've been doing some research
and I found

45:26.182 --> 45:28.142
some really disturbing
information.

45:28.184 --> 45:30.311
-About your ex.
-About Rick?

45:30.353 --> 45:33.730
He's gonna try
and take your son.

45:33.772 --> 45:35.024
He's gonna go for full custody?

45:35.066 --> 45:36.568
You mean he's gonna take me
to court.

45:36.609 --> 45:40.154
No, Jamie, he's going to try
and kidnap Preston.

45:40.196 --> 45:42.365
-What? No, Rick would never--
-Just think about it.

45:42.407 --> 45:44.576
You think he's gonna win in
court? He-he's cheated on you.

45:44.617 --> 45:45.577
He's ruined your family.

45:45.618 --> 45:46.911
There's no way he's gonna

45:46.952 --> 45:48.413
be able to win.

45:48.454 --> 45:50.789
How? How would he even--

45:50.831 --> 45:54.627
Lauren. She's connected
to Mexican drug cartels.

45:54.669 --> 45:57.129
Well, these people, they make
entire bus loads of children

45:57.171 --> 45:58.881
disappear.

46:00.966 --> 46:02.968
Okay, wait. Wait. Wait-wait...

46:03.010 --> 46:05.054
No. This... Where,
where are you getting this--

46:05.096 --> 46:06.431
I have my sources, I-I can't

46:06.472 --> 46:08.140
tell you anymore,
but they're reliable.

46:08.182 --> 46:09.642
Listen, I promise, Jamie,
I'm not gonna

46:09.684 --> 46:11.394
let anything happen to Preston,
okay?

46:11.436 --> 46:12.437
Trust me.

46:12.478 --> 46:13.646
I just need you to be aware

46:13.688 --> 46:16.023
of anyone suspicious
following you.

46:18.067 --> 46:22.071
Oh, my God! The man.
Outside my window.

46:22.113 --> 46:24.282
I knew I saw someone.

46:24.323 --> 46:26.033
I-I saw someone.
I could feel it!

46:26.075 --> 46:28.494
-What man? When?
-A-a few days ago.

46:28.536 --> 46:30.705
There was someone there.
And then last night...

46:30.747 --> 46:34.500
That makes sense. They're
probably already watching you.

46:34.542 --> 46:37.878
Jamie, you are in
so much danger right now.

46:37.920 --> 46:40.047
-I gotta go. I gotta go.
-I'll protect you, both of you.

46:40.089 --> 46:42.592
You and Preston
are my number-one priority.

46:42.634 --> 46:45.303
Listen to me, you need to be
careful who you speak to

46:45.344 --> 46:46.763
and who you trust
around Preston.

46:46.803 --> 46:48.347
-Can you do that?
-Uh-huh.

46:48.389 --> 46:49.848
And beware
of any connected device.

46:49.890 --> 46:51.517
Smart TVs, phones, cars...

46:51.559 --> 46:53.770
They can all be used as
surveillance tools to track you,

46:53.810 --> 46:55.563
to spy on you.

46:55.605 --> 46:57.982
-I have to go.
-It's okay.

47:18.336 --> 47:19.836
-Jamie?
-Where's Preston?

47:19.878 --> 47:21.838
-Upstairs.
-Are you sure?

47:21.880 --> 47:24.717
-Well, yeah, I just came down.
-Okay.

47:24.759 --> 47:27.637
-Where were you?
-Out.

47:27.679 --> 47:30.139
Well, Preston was asking
"Where's mommy?" all day.

47:30.181 --> 47:31.683
Okay, could you do me a favor?

47:31.724 --> 47:32.725
Could you make sure that Preston

47:32.767 --> 47:34.185
doesn't watch TV for a while?

47:34.226 --> 47:35.687
-Is he punished?
-No.

47:35.728 --> 47:37.563
I just don't know
what the TVs are hooked up to.

47:37.605 --> 47:40.316
-They could be monitoring us.
-Moni...

47:40.358 --> 47:43.027
-Who is "they?"
-Just please.

47:43.068 --> 47:44.570
Stop letting him watch TV.

47:44.612 --> 47:46.531
Okay, Jamie, okay.

47:46.572 --> 47:48.199
Thank you.

47:48.240 --> 47:51.076
What is going on with you?

47:51.118 --> 47:52.787
Don't you think it was weird

47:52.829 --> 47:55.623
that that man always knew
where I was?

47:55.665 --> 47:57.792
Where and when I would be there.

47:57.834 --> 47:59.293
Man?

48:00.670 --> 48:04.048
Jamie, you're safe here.
That was years ago.

48:04.089 --> 48:07.301
How do you know that we're safe?

48:08.302 --> 48:11.556
Okay. You need to talk to me.

48:11.597 --> 48:14.642
What has happened? I have
never seen you act like this.

48:14.684 --> 48:16.352
Act like what?

48:16.394 --> 48:19.397
Taking initiative,
all on my own.

48:19.438 --> 48:22.775
Being proactive
about our safety.

48:22.817 --> 48:24.985
-What?
-I heard you.

48:25.027 --> 48:27.154
Talking about me, last night.

48:27.196 --> 48:30.533
We love you and we are worried.

48:30.575 --> 48:32.660
And I have never seen you
so upset.

48:32.702 --> 48:36.414
And I think that you need
to talk to a therapist.

48:36.455 --> 48:37.914
Okay, I'm going upstairs.

48:37.956 --> 48:40.459
Jamie, I am talking to you.

48:40.501 --> 48:42.919
No, you're talking <i> at</i> me.

48:42.961 --> 48:45.297
And, look, I'm sorry
that I did not tell you

48:45.339 --> 48:47.633
where I was going
or when I would be back,

48:47.675 --> 48:49.009
but I am an adult.

48:49.051 --> 48:50.678
And if you can't
take care of Preston

48:50.720 --> 48:52.971
the way that I would like you
to take care of him

48:53.013 --> 48:55.932
when I am gone,
then we will go somewhere else.

48:59.478 --> 49:02.939
-Yes, we can.
-Okay. Thank you.

49:14.911 --> 49:18.038
[birds chirping]

49:20.917 --> 49:22.084
[groans]

49:22.668 --> 49:24.462
Hey.

49:24.503 --> 49:26.589
Um, mama,

49:26.631 --> 49:29.341
grandma won't let me watch TV.

49:29.383 --> 49:30.760
Good.

49:30.802 --> 49:33.011
I'm bored.

49:33.053 --> 49:35.514
Only boring kids are bored.

49:35.556 --> 49:36.849
Ah...

49:42.020 --> 49:44.816
[Preston] Mom,
there's someone outside.

49:51.988 --> 49:54.283
[gasps] Preston,
get away from the window.

50:01.624 --> 50:03.626
It's just grandpa.

50:03.668 --> 50:04.877
Okay.

50:04.919 --> 50:06.504
Hey, you wanna play
hide and seek?

50:06.545 --> 50:08.213
[giggles] Yeah, and I'm
definitely gonna find you.

50:08.255 --> 50:10.883
No, you won't.
It might take years.

50:10.925 --> 50:13.009
-Maybe centuries.
-Mm!

50:13.051 --> 50:14.762
You've never been up here.

50:14.804 --> 50:18.432
This is the best place
to play hide and seek.

50:18.474 --> 50:21.185
-[laughs] So...
-Yeah.

50:22.102 --> 50:24.814
[laughs] Whoa!

50:24.856 --> 50:27.399
-It's so big!
-Pretty cool, huh?

50:27.441 --> 50:28.985
[laughs]

50:30.486 --> 50:32.028
Whoa-ho!

50:34.949 --> 50:36.450
[chuckles]

50:36.492 --> 50:39.203
This thing really turns. Uh...

50:39.244 --> 50:41.622
-You're gonna hide or what?
-Yeah.

50:46.627 --> 50:48.044

[echoing] <i> This game is not fun.</i>

51:35.843 --> 51:37.219
Preston?

51:40.389 --> 51:42.975
Come out, come out,
wherever you are.

51:45.477 --> 51:47.772
Where are you hiding?

51:49.105 --> 51:50.524
Preston?

51:51.316 --> 51:53.360
I'm gonna find you.

51:54.445 --> 51:56.864
Preston?

51:56.906 --> 51:58.783
Preston, we're not
supposed to be down here.

51:58.824 --> 52:01.744
-It's not part of the game.
-[Boone] Cool.

52:01.786 --> 52:04.830
-[Preston] Cool!
-That is cool, buddy.

52:04.872 --> 52:07.291
-[Marlene] That is...
-[Preston] No!

52:07.332 --> 52:09.209
I'm taking that.
I love these things!

52:09.251 --> 52:11.503
[Marlene] ...grandpa.
You better hold on.

52:11.545 --> 52:13.255
Get your hands off of my son!

52:13.297 --> 52:16.341
-Jamie...
-Okay.

52:16.383 --> 52:19.428
Hey, buddy, why don't you go
upstairs and play in your room?

52:19.470 --> 52:21.513
-I'll be up in a little bit.
-No, you won't.

52:21.555 --> 52:22.890
-Okay, come on, Preston.
-It's okay.

52:22.932 --> 52:24.266
Come on, grandma has something

52:24.308 --> 52:25.559
she wants you to do for her.

52:25.601 --> 52:27.311
I want you to run upstairs

52:27.352 --> 52:29.521
and get my sweater for me.

52:29.563 --> 52:31.189
You can't keep my son
away from me.

52:31.231 --> 52:33.067
Did you think I wasn't gonna
find out, Rick?

52:33.109 --> 52:35.945
About your plan?
Having people follow us?

52:35.987 --> 52:37.863
-What?
-What were you going to do?

52:37.905 --> 52:39.406
Take him by force?

52:39.448 --> 52:41.700
It is never going to happen.
Do you understand me?

52:41.742 --> 52:43.702
-What are you talking about?
-[Casey] Whoa, whoa, whoa!

52:43.744 --> 52:45.370
Jamie, Jamie, calm down, okay?

52:45.412 --> 52:47.915
Rick just wanted to see his son.
Calm down.

52:47.957 --> 52:49.667
No, I'm not gonna calm down.

52:49.708 --> 52:51.376
You don't know
what I know about him.

52:51.418 --> 52:54.212
-What? What do you know?
-He's having people spy on us.

52:54.254 --> 52:55.631
Go ahead, tell 'em!

52:55.673 --> 52:58.092
I saw him.
I saw him outside the window.

52:58.134 --> 52:59.760
Jamie, dad went out and looked.

52:59.802 --> 53:02.680
Jamie, honey,
there was nobody out there.

53:02.721 --> 53:04.849
-No one was out there.
-[Rick] Jamie...

53:04.890 --> 53:07.309
Just listen to yourself.
Okay, stop.

53:07.351 --> 53:09.269
None of this is true.

53:09.311 --> 53:10.980
I love you.

53:13.524 --> 53:15.609
You don't believe me?

53:17.945 --> 53:20.364
None of you believe me?

53:22.240 --> 53:25.036
Stay the hell away
from me and my son.

53:26.202 --> 53:29.331
-He's my son, too!
-Jamie! Jamie!

53:29.373 --> 53:31.083
Jamie!

53:32.751 --> 53:36.047
We'll talk to her.
We will, we'll talk to her.

53:36.088 --> 53:37.798
I-I don't know
what to tell you, Rick.

53:37.840 --> 53:39.800
I've never seen her like this.

53:43.095 --> 53:44.513
-[Preston] Mom?
-Preston.

53:44.555 --> 53:46.057
I need you to go
grab your backpack, okay?

53:46.098 --> 53:47.599
We're leaving.

53:47.641 --> 53:50.519
-Why?
-Because I said so!

53:52.146 --> 53:54.606
-Can I stay with daddy?
-No.

53:54.648 --> 53:56.734
-Absolutely not.
-Please?

53:56.775 --> 53:59.444
Preston!
Please, go get your backpack!

54:07.452 --> 54:09.705
-You guys are crazy.
-Let us talk to her.

54:09.747 --> 54:13.542
She is, she's going through
a really rough time right now.

54:13.584 --> 54:15.502
I get it. I do, okay? I get it.

54:15.544 --> 54:17.963
But... she's so angry.

54:18.005 --> 54:19.924
-I know.
-Gosh, I wonder why that is.

54:19.965 --> 54:22.634
I did not cheat on her.
I didn't.

54:24.095 --> 54:25.470
[car door shuts]

54:25.512 --> 54:27.765
Oh, my goodness...

54:27.806 --> 54:30.768
[car engine revving]

54:34.188 --> 54:36.065
I'm going after her.

54:47.618 --> 54:50.079
[sighs] Oh, man.

54:50.121 --> 54:52.164
They were looking at me
like I was...

54:52.206 --> 54:54.875
[chuckles] crazy.

54:56.877 --> 54:59.838
I feel like I am going crazy.

54:59.880 --> 55:02.216
You're not crazy.

55:02.258 --> 55:03.884
That word is offensive.

55:03.926 --> 55:05.928
Well, it's just that...

55:07.263 --> 55:09.723
Now that we know the truth,

55:09.765 --> 55:12.810
I'm beginning to realize
how, how vulnerable we are,

55:12.851 --> 55:14.686
how easy it is to find us.

55:14.728 --> 55:16.939
-And I...
-[cell phone rings]

55:19.357 --> 55:21.819
You did the right thing
coming here.

55:21.860 --> 55:24.738
You're safe here.
You're safe here with me.

55:25.906 --> 55:28.117
And I'm glad you're here.

55:38.585 --> 55:40.545
[Preston laughs]

55:41.672 --> 55:43.590
[Preston] Over here!

55:43.632 --> 55:46.844
[indistinct chatter]

56:03.861 --> 56:07.072
[cell phone ringing]

56:18.000 --> 56:19.918
[Preston] You're never gonna
catch me!

56:21.461 --> 56:23.714
[intense music]

56:23.755 --> 56:25.465
Good throw.

56:41.773 --> 56:43.025
[chuckling]

57:03.670 --> 57:06.340
[Casey on voicemail] <i> Come on,</i>
<i>Jamie, I'm on your side always.</i>

57:06.382 --> 57:08.008
<i>You gotta talk to me.</i>

57:08.050 --> 57:10.719
<i>Listen. I have bad news</i>
<i>to share. So call me back.</i>

57:10.761 --> 57:13.013
<i>Let me know</i>
<i>where you're staying, okay?</i>

57:13.055 --> 57:16.225
<i>I love you. Call me, please.</i>

57:29.071 --> 57:30.530
-Over here!
-Whoa! Up!

57:30.572 --> 57:32.449
-You want it? You want it?
-Come back.

57:32.490 --> 57:34.243
-[Whit] I want it.
-[Preston] What? Yeah?

57:34.285 --> 57:36.161
-[Preston] Cool.
-[Whit] Yeah.

57:38.496 --> 57:41.625
[indistinct chatter]

57:42.793 --> 57:45.503
-[Casey] How's Preston?
-[Jamie] He's fine.

57:45.545 --> 57:48.299
Hey, Jamie, come on.

57:48.340 --> 57:49.716
Well, don't shut me out.

57:51.260 --> 57:53.511
Don't be a Mayfield.

57:55.180 --> 57:57.057
Look. I know you're mad.

57:57.099 --> 58:00.644
I know that it, it seems like we
were consorting with the enemy,

58:00.685 --> 58:04.689
but I will hate Rick with you,
okay? Done. Hate him.

58:06.524 --> 58:08.193
But you gotta talk to me.

58:08.235 --> 58:10.821
I found out some information
about him.

58:11.822 --> 58:13.782
Bad stuff.

58:13.824 --> 58:15.367
What?

58:15.409 --> 58:19.037
I can... I can't.
I can't talk about it.

58:21.248 --> 58:22.207
Jamie, did he hit you?

58:22.249 --> 58:24.501
-No.
-Did he hit Preston?

58:24.542 --> 58:26.711
Because you said something about
him taking Preston by force.

58:26.753 --> 58:30.632
No. I just... Look, I can't
get into it right now, okay?

58:30.674 --> 58:33.969
I'm on your side, Jamie, okay,

58:34.011 --> 58:36.888
even if mom and dad are trying
to be all nice-y nice.

58:36.930 --> 58:39.266
It's just 'cause they don't
like drama, you know that.

58:41.477 --> 58:45.689
We have to protect Preston,
okay?

58:45.730 --> 58:47.858
Always.

58:47.899 --> 58:50.527
What did you wanna
tell me about?

58:50.568 --> 58:51.820
Um...

58:53.322 --> 58:55.949
Jamie, I have some bad news.

58:58.369 --> 59:01.079
Auntie Loretta died yesterday.

59:01.663 --> 59:03.207
Oh...

59:03.248 --> 59:05.501
-Oh, no.
-I know.

59:07.794 --> 59:11.507
-How's mom?
-Being very mom-like.

59:11.548 --> 59:14.176
Taking over all the arrangements
so she doesn't have to sit down

59:14.218 --> 59:17.262
and actually deal with it
for a minute.

59:18.596 --> 59:22.393
They're having the memorial
at her house...

59:22.434 --> 59:23.935
and you need to be there.

59:23.977 --> 59:25.770
And I know it's bad timing,
okay?

59:25.812 --> 59:29.983
One family drama at a time
would obviously be preferable,

59:30.025 --> 59:34.029
but, well, I do think
death is the trump card.

59:34.071 --> 59:35.447
Yeah.

59:36.656 --> 59:39.368
Ha! Bummer times!

59:39.410 --> 59:43.455
Now that I wanna eat
five gallons of ice cream...

59:43.497 --> 59:45.999
Tell me something good. Tell me,
tell me about this new guy.

59:46.041 --> 59:47.625
Spill the tea.

59:47.667 --> 59:49.461
Oh, um...

59:51.088 --> 59:53.048
He's wonderful.

59:53.090 --> 59:54.925
Brilliant.

59:54.966 --> 59:57.094
He's traveled the world.

59:57.135 --> 59:58.720
He's studying law at Berkeley.

59:58.762 --> 01:00:02.182
Oh! Wow! Law at Berkeley!

01:00:02.224 --> 01:00:03.767
[laughs]

01:00:13.944 --> 01:00:15.987
Here you go, babe.

01:00:19.032 --> 01:00:21.868
-I don't like green beans.
-Mm, nice try.

01:00:21.910 --> 01:00:24.121
Where did these green beans
come from?

01:00:24.162 --> 01:00:25.414
Uh, the grocery store.

01:00:25.456 --> 01:00:29.209
-What section?
-The frozen foods.

01:00:30.627 --> 01:00:33.338
There was a listeriosis bacteria
outbreak in Europe.

01:00:33.380 --> 01:00:36.633
Because of frozen vegetables,
nine people died last week.

01:00:36.674 --> 01:00:40.471
-Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know.
-Yeah, it's okay.

01:00:40.512 --> 01:00:42.389
We just, we just need
to be more careful.

01:00:42.431 --> 01:00:44.057
[Whit] There's,
there's all sorts of risks

01:00:44.099 --> 01:00:45.683
associated with processed foods.

01:00:45.725 --> 01:00:47.018
[Jamie] Right.

01:00:47.060 --> 01:00:49.938
So, I, um...

01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:52.149
I met with Casey today.

01:00:53.567 --> 01:00:55.319
We got some bad news.

01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:58.405
-My Aunt Loretta passed away.
-Oh, no.

01:00:58.447 --> 01:01:01.699
-Who?
-Your Great-aunt Loretta.

01:01:01.741 --> 01:01:03.076
You were really young
when you met her,

01:01:03.118 --> 01:01:04.911
you probably don't remember.

01:01:04.953 --> 01:01:06.497
But she loved you.

01:01:06.538 --> 01:01:10.459
-I'm sorry, Jamie.
-Yeah, thanks.

01:01:10.501 --> 01:01:13.795
And tomorrow is the memorial
service at my parents' house.

01:01:13.837 --> 01:01:17.299
-So I've gotta go.
-I'll come with you.

01:01:17.341 --> 01:01:19.635
-Really?
-It's, it's a known location.

01:01:19.676 --> 01:01:21.678
I need to make sure it's safe.

01:01:23.096 --> 01:01:24.556
Okay.

01:01:26.183 --> 01:01:29.436
I-is there any proof
that your-your aunt passed away?

01:01:29.478 --> 01:01:30.812
Oh, I, I don't know.

01:01:30.854 --> 01:01:33.273
Because maybe Casey came up
with this idea

01:01:33.315 --> 01:01:35.733
to get you to talk,
preying on your sympathy.

01:01:35.775 --> 01:01:37.277
No.

01:01:37.319 --> 01:01:40.531
No, Casey would never lie
about something like that.

01:01:40.572 --> 01:01:42.533
If there's anything that I know
is that you can never

01:01:42.574 --> 01:01:43.825
really know a person.

01:01:43.867 --> 01:01:45.702
People will surprise you
sometimes.

01:01:45.743 --> 01:01:47.954
Right, and I agree with you,
but Casey

01:01:47.996 --> 01:01:50.290
has always been my ally.

01:01:50.332 --> 01:01:53.043
She was the only one
who believed me when...

01:01:56.588 --> 01:01:59.299
Okay. Yeah,
if-if you think it's...

01:01:59.341 --> 01:02:01.718
If you think it's legitimate,
then we'll go.

01:02:01.759 --> 01:02:03.928
Yeah. Thanks.

01:02:06.473 --> 01:02:08.016
Where's grandma and grandpa?

01:02:08.058 --> 01:02:09.726
-Inside.
-Inside.

01:02:10.686 --> 01:02:12.103
You sure you're ready for this?

01:02:12.145 --> 01:02:14.731
Yeah. Yeah, I wanna support you.

01:02:14.772 --> 01:02:18.527
-Jamie, let's get in and out.
-Ah, yeah.

01:02:18.569 --> 01:02:20.278
[indistinct chatter]

01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:23.031
[whispers] I told her
he was welcome to come.

01:02:26.076 --> 01:02:28.662
-There's grandpa.
-[Preston] Grandpa!

01:02:28.704 --> 01:02:29.954
Hey, buddy.

01:02:29.996 --> 01:02:32.207
Oh, you're getting so heavy.

01:02:32.249 --> 01:02:33.625
-You wanna go get a sandwich?
-Yeah.

01:02:33.667 --> 01:02:34.876
All right.

01:02:34.918 --> 01:02:37.629
-Hi, can I take that for you?
-Oh.

01:02:37.671 --> 01:02:39.089
Thanks.

01:02:45.178 --> 01:02:46.430
Okay, you stay in here.

01:02:46.471 --> 01:02:47.514
I'm gonna go check out
the other rooms.

01:02:47.556 --> 01:02:49.266
-Okay.
-Yeah.

01:02:51.393 --> 01:02:54.605
[instrumental music]

01:03:02.404 --> 01:03:04.155
[Maddy] Jamie!

01:03:04.197 --> 01:03:05.741
[gasps]

01:03:05.782 --> 01:03:09.369
-Oh, I can't believe it.
-Oh, Aunt Maddy.

01:03:10.954 --> 01:03:13.164
[Jamie] I'm so sorry.

01:03:13.998 --> 01:03:15.250
Hey, have you seen my mom?

01:03:15.292 --> 01:03:17.544
Yeah, baby, just right in here.
Come on.

01:03:17.586 --> 01:03:18.836
-Okay.
-Look at you.

01:03:18.878 --> 01:03:20.797
You're a full-grown woman.

01:03:20.838 --> 01:03:23.634
My gosh,
I barely recognized you.

01:03:23.675 --> 01:03:26.678
-Thank Marlene for that.
-Oh, yeah.

01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:29.389
-I know. Oh, there she is.
-Oh.

01:03:29.431 --> 01:03:31.849
Hi, sweetheart.
Thank you for coming.

01:03:31.891 --> 01:03:33.935
Hi, Mom. Of course.

01:03:35.270 --> 01:03:36.896
So...

01:03:36.938 --> 01:03:39.857
[Maddy] My son's here.
I haven't seen him in a while.

01:03:39.899 --> 01:03:43.445
-Let's go say hi.
-I suppose we should.

01:03:45.989 --> 01:03:49.117
Oh, my God,
I'm so glad you're here.

01:03:50.285 --> 01:03:52.287
How is she doing?

01:03:52.329 --> 01:03:55.081
I don't know. Ask me tonight
when everyone's gone.

01:03:55.123 --> 01:03:57.000
Yeah, right.

01:03:57.041 --> 01:04:00.420
Oh. So I brought him.

01:04:00.462 --> 01:04:02.839
-Who?
-The guy.

01:04:02.880 --> 01:04:05.091
-Him? Yes!
-Yeah.

01:04:06.468 --> 01:04:09.304
Oh, my God!

01:04:09.346 --> 01:04:10.888
Whit?

01:04:10.930 --> 01:04:12.599
Little Whittie?

01:04:12.641 --> 01:04:15.059
-Hey, Casey!
-[Maddy] This is fantastic.

01:04:15.101 --> 01:04:16.770
[Maddy] You know,
you guys haven't seen each other

01:04:16.812 --> 01:04:19.397
since you were kids.

01:04:19.439 --> 01:04:22.609
[intense music]

01:04:47.884 --> 01:04:49.678
Excuse me.

01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:51.847
I-I'm sorry, I'm sorry.

01:04:51.888 --> 01:04:53.557
[breathing heavily]

01:04:54.850 --> 01:04:56.685
Whit, let's go say hi
to your father.

01:04:56.727 --> 01:04:58.729
Give me a minute.

01:05:01.314 --> 01:05:03.316
Where did your sister go?

01:05:03.358 --> 01:05:05.318
I have no idea.

01:05:08.196 --> 01:05:10.782
I cannot believe
that Whit showed up.

01:05:10.824 --> 01:05:14.494
-Yeah. Never seen him in--
-Twelve years.

01:05:14.536 --> 01:05:17.455
Um, would you help me
find your Aunt Annabelle?

01:05:17.497 --> 01:05:19.708
I know she's here.

01:05:20.375 --> 01:05:21.668
Yeah.

01:05:23.545 --> 01:05:25.171
No, no, no, no, no.

01:05:25.213 --> 01:05:27.173
-No. Whit!
-Hey.

01:05:27.215 --> 01:05:28.966
-Calm down, calm down.
-This is a joke, right?

01:05:29.008 --> 01:05:30.927
-Please tell me this is a joke!
-Jamie...

01:05:30.968 --> 01:05:33.012
We're cousins.
You're my Cousin Whit.

01:05:33.054 --> 01:05:34.222
Whit, Whit my cousin is you.

01:05:34.264 --> 01:05:35.432
-We are cousins.
-Listen to me.

01:05:35.473 --> 01:05:37.267
Oh, my God. Wait, wait.

01:05:37.308 --> 01:05:39.269
-Oh, my God.
-I love you.

01:05:39.310 --> 01:05:41.229
What?

01:05:41.271 --> 01:05:42.606
I love you.

01:05:42.647 --> 01:05:45.316
Wait! Hold on!
You didn't know, right?

01:05:45.358 --> 01:05:47.861
No, of course not.

01:05:47.903 --> 01:05:50.530
You're not freaked out?

01:05:50.572 --> 01:05:52.407
-I guess not.
-You guess not?

01:05:52.449 --> 01:05:54.367
-We didn't grow up together.
-So?

01:05:54.409 --> 01:05:55.993
So it's not like
you're my sister.

01:05:56.035 --> 01:05:59.289
-Our moms are sisters!
-Sisters that never speak.

01:05:59.330 --> 01:06:01.291
God, is anyone
who they claim to be?

01:06:01.332 --> 01:06:04.127
-Me! I am!
-You're not hearing me.

01:06:04.168 --> 01:06:06.797
I am, Jamie. I love you.

01:06:06.838 --> 01:06:08.590
And I feel this need
to protect you

01:06:08.632 --> 01:06:10.967
from anything and everything
that could possibly hurt you.

01:06:11.008 --> 01:06:13.511
You don't know the things
that I know.

01:06:15.054 --> 01:06:18.349
Okay. I'm-I...
Please, I-I need you to leave.

01:06:18.391 --> 01:06:21.352
Okay? Just, just give me
a little bit of time to think.

01:06:21.394 --> 01:06:23.271
Preston and I will stay here.

01:06:23.313 --> 01:06:25.440
I don't think
that's a good idea.

01:06:25.482 --> 01:06:26.900
We'll be fine.

01:06:28.860 --> 01:06:30.612
Just do me a favor.

01:06:30.654 --> 01:06:32.572
Sleep in the same bedroom
as Preston.

01:06:32.614 --> 01:06:34.282
Lock all the doors and windows
to the house.

01:06:34.324 --> 01:06:35.742
Note any suspicious activity.

01:06:35.784 --> 01:06:37.452
Please, please...

01:06:38.912 --> 01:06:41.122
Don't hesitate to call me.

01:07:02.185 --> 01:07:05.062
Oh. Aunt Maddy, are you okay?

01:07:05.104 --> 01:07:07.148
Yeah. I'm good.

01:07:09.275 --> 01:07:10.819
It was crazy seeing Whit today.

01:07:10.861 --> 01:07:14.823
I haven't seen him since...
since forever.

01:07:14.865 --> 01:07:19.035
Yeah. Well, I can never
keep track of him.

01:07:19.661 --> 01:07:21.788
Believe me, I try.

01:07:21.830 --> 01:07:25.333
Well, I heard he's,
I heard he's in law school.

01:07:25.375 --> 01:07:27.711
Is that what he told you?

01:07:27.752 --> 01:07:29.420
I doubt that.

01:07:29.462 --> 01:07:33.633
Don't get me wrong.
He's smart enough.
He's brilliant.

01:07:34.718 --> 01:07:38.095
He could do so much.

01:07:38.137 --> 01:07:41.641
But wasn't, uh, wasn't he
travelling this last year?

01:07:41.683 --> 01:07:43.184
Abroad?

01:07:43.226 --> 01:07:47.605
Casey, Whit doesn't even have
a passport.

01:07:47.647 --> 01:07:50.525
He was denied one
by the State Department.

01:07:50.567 --> 01:07:52.235
Thank God.

01:07:52.736 --> 01:07:54.029
Denied?

01:07:54.070 --> 01:07:55.488
[Maddy] Lord knows
I love that boy.

01:07:55.530 --> 01:07:59.283
[sobs] But I don't know
what I did wrong.

01:07:59.659 --> 01:08:01.118
No.

01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:04.163
Tell me, Casey.
Tell me what I did wrong.

01:08:04.205 --> 01:08:07.124
I mean,
I got him the best tutors,

01:08:07.166 --> 01:08:09.460
the best therapists, doctors...

01:08:09.502 --> 01:08:11.462
because I always knew

01:08:11.504 --> 01:08:14.549
he was different
from my other boys.

01:08:15.592 --> 01:08:17.426
Different how?

01:08:18.469 --> 01:08:20.388
He'd fixate, you know,

01:08:20.430 --> 01:08:22.515
obsess on things.

01:08:22.557 --> 01:08:25.435
He'd lock himself in his room
for hours and hours

01:08:25.475 --> 01:08:27.520
just reading, you know?

01:08:27.562 --> 01:08:29.397
Reading about CIA...

01:08:29.439 --> 01:08:32.399
He, he would create
whole worlds.

01:08:32.442 --> 01:08:34.527
[sniffles] That boy...

01:08:34.569 --> 01:08:37.613
he could convince you
the sky was purple.

01:08:40.658 --> 01:08:43.453
I just didn't know back then
there was a name for it.

01:08:44.203 --> 01:08:45.705
A name?

01:08:46.790 --> 01:08:49.166
Paranoid schizophrenia.

01:08:49.207 --> 01:08:51.294
-Paranoid--
-Shh!

01:08:51.335 --> 01:08:54.255
Don't tell anybody. We're not
supposed to tell anybody.

01:08:54.296 --> 01:08:56.299
Lord knows we wouldn't wanna
bring any shame

01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:58.384
on the family, right?

01:08:59.886 --> 01:09:01.763
All I ever wanted

01:09:01.805 --> 01:09:03.555
was for him to meet a nice girl.

01:09:03.598 --> 01:09:05.265
I thought he had.

01:09:05.308 --> 01:09:08.685
I mean, he met
this lovely girl, Sandy.

01:09:08.728 --> 01:09:11.064
You know,
she was smart and beautiful

01:09:11.106 --> 01:09:15.068
and... just a beauty queen,
just like Jamie.

01:09:15.819 --> 01:09:17.403
Well, what happened?

01:09:17.444 --> 01:09:19.322
I don't know really.

01:09:19.363 --> 01:09:23.283
I never know
which part of his story is truth

01:09:23.326 --> 01:09:26.245
and which part
is complete fabrication.

01:09:27.872 --> 01:09:29.957
But when he told you a story,

01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:32.710
he believed it to his bones.

01:09:32.752 --> 01:09:34.671
One minute,
"Mom, I met this girl

01:09:34.712 --> 01:09:38.549
and we're gonna get married
and she's it."

01:09:38.591 --> 01:09:42.428
Next minute, there's
a restraining order out on him.

01:09:43.846 --> 01:09:45.348
He just disappeared.

01:09:45.389 --> 01:09:49.268
I haven't seen him
for over a year until right now.

01:09:56.943 --> 01:09:59.070
Mama. Mama, stop.
Why don't you let me do that?

01:09:59.112 --> 01:10:01.238
-[Casey] You just relax.
-No, I'm, I'm fine.

01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:03.324
Hey, what do you say, you and I

01:10:03.366 --> 01:10:05.409
go out on the front porch
and sit?

01:10:05.451 --> 01:10:07.620
I'm just gonna wrap up the food.

01:10:07.662 --> 01:10:10.081
No, mama, I got it. Stop.

01:10:11.124 --> 01:10:12.625
Come on, honey.

01:10:12.667 --> 01:10:14.585
What's wrong?

01:10:14.627 --> 01:10:16.671
What do you think?

01:10:16.713 --> 01:10:18.131
Sorry.

01:10:18.173 --> 01:10:20.884
Mama, can I watch TV?

01:10:20.925 --> 01:10:23.720
No, Preston.
I told you, no video games.

01:10:23.761 --> 01:10:25.555
Give it to me.

01:10:25.596 --> 01:10:28.183
I told him
he could play a little bit.

01:10:28.224 --> 01:10:31.602
Okay, well, I'm saying no.
So the answer's no, okay?

01:10:31.644 --> 01:10:33.813
Jamie, I told him
he could watch for five minutes

01:10:33.855 --> 01:10:35.439
and then
he could get ready for bed.

01:10:35.481 --> 01:10:37.316
I'm his mother, actually!

01:10:37.358 --> 01:10:40.361
Hey, Jamie. Chill.

01:10:40.403 --> 01:10:43.156
Mama, five minutes!

01:10:43.198 --> 01:10:44.615
What did I just say? I said no.

01:10:44.657 --> 01:10:47.577
Please, listen to me
and just go up to your room.

01:10:49.746 --> 01:10:51.956
Jamie...

01:10:51.998 --> 01:10:53.583
it's a video game.

01:10:53.624 --> 01:10:57.128
Which I don't want him
playing. Okay?

01:10:58.295 --> 01:10:59.797
Jamie...

01:11:00.381 --> 01:11:01.716
Jamie.

01:11:01.758 --> 01:11:03.342
-I can't do this right now.
-Jamie, stop.

01:11:03.384 --> 01:11:05.261
-Stop! Jamie!
-What?

01:11:05.302 --> 01:11:07.180
I know.

01:11:07.222 --> 01:11:08.932
You know what?

01:11:08.973 --> 01:11:12.185
I know that Cousin Whit
is the guy from the coffee shop.

01:11:13.686 --> 01:11:16.606
-What are you doing?
-I didn't know.

01:11:16.647 --> 01:11:20.735
-I didn't know.
-Okay. Okay. It's okay.

01:11:20.777 --> 01:11:23.362
What am I gonna do, Casey?

01:11:23.404 --> 01:11:25.865
-What do I do? I--
-You end it.

01:11:25.907 --> 01:11:28.910
-Yeah, but it just, but he--
-He's your cousin.

01:11:28.952 --> 01:11:30.995
I know, but...
No, you don't understand.

01:11:31.037 --> 01:11:33.706
He knows all the stuff,
he knows the stuff about Rick

01:11:33.748 --> 01:11:35.750
and the cartel
and-and then, and then--

01:11:35.792 --> 01:11:37.919
-No. No, Jamie, no.
-He knows about the man who's--

01:11:37.961 --> 01:11:39.336
We're being monitored, okay?

01:11:39.378 --> 01:11:41.047
And the electronics,
the electronics,

01:11:41.089 --> 01:11:42.257
we don't know
what they're doing.

01:11:42.298 --> 01:11:43.549
No, no, no, no, Jamie!

01:11:43.591 --> 01:11:45.551
No, no, no, stop, stop.
Listen to me.

01:11:45.593 --> 01:11:48.512
No one has seen
or heard from Whit in months.

01:11:48.554 --> 01:11:51.933
Not even Aunt Maddy.
Do you know why?

01:11:51.975 --> 01:11:54.518
-Because he was travelling.
-No.

01:11:54.560 --> 01:11:57.063
No, Jamie,
he doesn't even have a passport.

01:11:58.189 --> 01:12:00.399
Whit is sick.

01:12:00.441 --> 01:12:02.777
He's been dealing with all sorts
of mental health issues.

01:12:02.819 --> 01:12:04.988
He has ever since we were kids,
don't you remember?

01:12:05.029 --> 01:12:08.074
He'd always be away
at boarding school.

01:12:09.366 --> 01:12:11.661
Okay. Well,
it wasn't boarding school.

01:12:11.702 --> 01:12:13.746
[cell phone ringing]

01:12:13.788 --> 01:12:15.498
No, don't answer that.

01:12:15.539 --> 01:12:17.500
[cell phone ringing]

01:12:17.541 --> 01:12:19.043
Jamie, don't answer that.

01:12:19.085 --> 01:12:21.129
[cell phone ringing]

01:12:21.796 --> 01:12:24.423
Hey. Hey, look.

01:12:24.465 --> 01:12:27.177
It was a mistake. It's okay.

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:33.891
[Whit on voicemail] <i> Jamie.</i>
<i>Jamie, you are in danger.</i>

01:12:33.933 --> 01:12:35.726
<i>You can't stay there, Jamie.</i>

01:12:35.768 --> 01:12:37.603
<i>-Do you understand? Call me...</i>
-You see?

01:12:37.645 --> 01:12:39.355
He says that I'm in danger here.
And I just, I--

01:12:39.396 --> 01:12:42.358
No, Jamie, stop,
and listen to yourself!

01:12:42.399 --> 01:12:44.610
You are so paranoid!

01:12:44.652 --> 01:12:46.696
Whit is crazy.

01:12:46.737 --> 01:12:48.948
You are safe here. Okay?

01:12:48.990 --> 01:12:52.243
You and Preston are safe here.
I promise.

01:12:52.285 --> 01:12:53.577
Okay.

01:12:54.620 --> 01:12:56.789
[cell phone ringing]

01:12:56.831 --> 01:13:01.377
Ugh! Answer and just tell him
you need space.

01:13:04.463 --> 01:13:06.132
-Whit? Whit?
-[Whit on phone] <i> Jamie, Jamie!</i>

01:13:06.174 --> 01:13:07.675
-Stop.
<i>-Don't, don't do this, come on.</i>

01:13:07.717 --> 01:13:10.261
-You need my protection.
-[Jamie] <i> No, I need you--</i>

01:13:10.303 --> 01:13:12.305
-Don't, you don't understand!
<i>-Stop, stop.</i>

01:13:12.347 --> 01:13:13.931
<i>-Listen.</i>
-You're vulnerable there.

01:13:13.973 --> 01:13:15.558
This is over, okay? I'm sorry.

01:13:15.599 --> 01:13:17.101
-They're coming for you.
-I'm sorry. It's over.

01:13:17.143 --> 01:13:18.311
They're coming for you.

01:13:18.353 --> 01:13:19.854
They're coming
for you and Preston.

01:13:19.896 --> 01:13:21.522
Whit, I'm sorry, this is over.

01:13:21.564 --> 01:13:23.191
I'm sorry.

01:13:24.525 --> 01:13:27.028
Come here. Come here. I gotcha.

01:13:27.070 --> 01:13:28.905
Jamie! Jamie!

01:13:28.946 --> 01:13:31.115
Jamie, d-don't do this.

01:13:37.663 --> 01:13:39.249
[grunts]

01:13:41.584 --> 01:13:44.170
[panting]

01:13:45.462 --> 01:13:47.840
-What are you doing?
-Shut up!

01:13:47.882 --> 01:13:50.134
This is all your fault!

01:13:50.176 --> 01:13:52.929
[Whit grunting]

01:13:56.391 --> 01:13:59.435
[Whit] No! No, no!

01:14:03.522 --> 01:14:05.649
I can't, I can't!

01:14:08.527 --> 01:14:11.281
[Whit] Yes, I can! Yes, I can.

01:14:12.489 --> 01:14:14.117
Listen to me.

01:14:18.955 --> 01:14:21.707
Listen, Whit.
Look, you don't have to do this.

01:14:21.749 --> 01:14:23.500
I know who you are.

01:14:23.542 --> 01:14:26.545
-I know everything about you.
-She's my wife.

01:14:26.587 --> 01:14:29.548
-You stay away from her.
-She's not your wife.

01:14:29.590 --> 01:14:31.842
She's not your wife.

01:14:31.884 --> 01:14:35.096
-What's the matter with you?
-You think I'm crazy?

01:14:38.933 --> 01:14:42.895
Just let me go. Look, let's just
talk about this, okay?

01:14:42.937 --> 01:14:44.688
Let's just...

01:14:50.236 --> 01:14:53.281
She was supposed to be mine.

01:14:53.323 --> 01:14:56.993
I've loved her my entire life.
You hardly even know her.

01:14:58.035 --> 01:15:00.413
It's time for you
to go to sleep.

01:15:12.758 --> 01:15:14.010
[Jamie sighs]

01:15:19.807 --> 01:15:22.101
When did this arrive?

01:15:22.143 --> 01:15:23.811
Uh, a few days ago.

01:15:23.853 --> 01:15:26.730
-While you were sleeping.
-And you kept it from me?

01:15:26.772 --> 01:15:29.900
Well, you've been a little
preoccupied lately, Jamie.

01:15:31.402 --> 01:15:34.197
Basically, straight forward,
it's divorce paperwork

01:15:34.238 --> 01:15:36.657
with joint custody for Preston.

01:15:36.699 --> 01:15:40.661
[scoffs] What if
this is a diversion?

01:15:40.703 --> 01:15:41.996
Why would it be a diversion?

01:15:42.038 --> 01:15:43.164
Well, I don't know, but I'm not,

01:15:43.206 --> 01:15:44.207
I'm not gonna sign those.

01:15:44.248 --> 01:15:45.249
Jamie.

01:15:45.291 --> 01:15:46.501
What would be so wrong

01:15:46.542 --> 01:15:47.710
with joint custody?

01:15:47.751 --> 01:15:49.920
-Are you serious?
-Well, yeah.

01:15:49.962 --> 01:15:53.341
I mean, part of a divorce
is learning how to co-parent.

01:15:53.383 --> 01:15:55.759
He's not even demanding
sole custody, honey.

01:15:55.801 --> 01:15:58.554
[Casey] Actually, he's
not even demanding anything.

01:15:58.595 --> 01:16:01.724
He's requesting. And they
are reasonable requests.

01:16:01.765 --> 01:16:03.726
Okay, well,
I want full custody.

01:16:03.767 --> 01:16:06.103
[Marlene] Why, Jamie? Why?

01:16:06.145 --> 01:16:08.772
Why, because he...
It's my job to protect my child.

01:16:08.814 --> 01:16:10.900
W-why are you guys
fighting me on this?

01:16:10.941 --> 01:16:12.318
[Marlene] And you are my child

01:16:12.360 --> 01:16:14.153
and part of my job
is to protect you.

01:16:14.195 --> 01:16:18.615
And right now you are being
completely nonsensical.

01:16:18.657 --> 01:16:22.078
Don't act like you've always
protected me, mama.

01:16:22.119 --> 01:16:23.538
Do not.

01:16:24.830 --> 01:16:27.791
Okay. Uh, you know what
I'm in the mood for?

01:16:27.833 --> 01:16:29.668
-Ice cream.
-Ice cream!

01:16:29.710 --> 01:16:31.587
-Yeah? Let's go get some.
-[Preston] Okay.

01:16:31.628 --> 01:16:33.923
-[Casey] Come on.
-No, no, it's...

01:16:33.964 --> 01:16:35.425
You know what?
It's too dangerous.

01:16:35.466 --> 01:16:37.009
-No. Jamie, Jamie.
-I don't want him outside.

01:16:37.051 --> 01:16:38.802
You gotta calm down. Okay?

01:16:38.844 --> 01:16:40.721
Preston needs to get out of here
where you guys talk

01:16:40.763 --> 01:16:42.139
and we're gonna get
some ice cream

01:16:42.181 --> 01:16:43.933
and then I'm gonna bring him
right back.

01:16:43.974 --> 01:16:45.642
Okay, but don't let him
out of your sight.

01:16:45.684 --> 01:16:47.144
Okay, I won't, I promise.

01:16:47.186 --> 01:16:49.564
He's very safe
with his Auntie Casey.

01:16:49.605 --> 01:16:51.357
I'm tough. Come on. Let's go.

01:16:51.399 --> 01:16:54.735
-Bye, Mommy. Love you.
-Bye, baby. I love you, too.

01:16:59.407 --> 01:17:00.657
Okay.

01:17:01.951 --> 01:17:04.620
I just, I need you
to be on my side.

01:17:08.916 --> 01:17:10.293
Jamie...

01:17:11.461 --> 01:17:14.589
we <i> are</i> on your side,

01:17:14.630 --> 01:17:18.175
and we are also
on Preston's side.

01:17:20.386 --> 01:17:22.388
Why do you say that
like it's two separate things?

01:17:22.430 --> 01:17:25.724
Enough, Jamie. Enough already.

01:17:27.184 --> 01:17:29.145
This is why I left home.

01:17:31.272 --> 01:17:32.482
[sighs]

01:17:34.984 --> 01:17:37.194
[cell phone ringing]

01:18:00.176 --> 01:18:03.346
[banging on door]

01:18:13.356 --> 01:18:16.526
[banging on door]

01:18:18.444 --> 01:18:20.655
What in the world?

01:18:24.283 --> 01:18:26.452
-Whit?
-Jamie!

01:18:26.494 --> 01:18:27.953
-Whit!
-Jamie?

01:18:27.995 --> 01:18:30.080
Whit, what are you doing?

01:18:31.332 --> 01:18:34.043
Where is she?
What did you do with her?

01:18:34.084 --> 01:18:36.045
What are you talking about,
Whit?

01:18:36.086 --> 01:18:38.088
If you don't tell me
where Jamie is right now,

01:18:38.130 --> 01:18:39.923
I will force you to tell me.

01:18:39.965 --> 01:18:41.425
Whit!

01:18:42.801 --> 01:18:44.178
What the hell is going on here?

01:18:44.220 --> 01:18:47.181
You need to tell me
where Jamie is right now!

01:18:47.223 --> 01:18:48.516
I will not ask you again.

01:18:48.558 --> 01:18:50.476
Don't you ever come into my home

01:18:50.518 --> 01:18:51.977
and talk to me like that, ever!

01:18:52.019 --> 01:18:53.979
I was afraid you were gonna
say that, Uncle Boone.

01:18:54.021 --> 01:18:56.273
Okay, Whit,
you need to calm down.

01:18:56.315 --> 01:18:58.526
I wouldn't let you hurt her.

01:18:58.568 --> 01:19:00.027
Hurt Jamie?

01:19:00.069 --> 01:19:02.405
-[grunting]
-[screams]

01:19:02.446 --> 01:19:04.907
Oh! Oh! Wait! Boone!

01:19:04.948 --> 01:19:06.659
[gasps]

01:19:07.910 --> 01:19:10.663
Boone! What did you do, Whit?

01:19:10.705 --> 01:19:12.789
-God, Whit, you...
-Where is she?

01:19:12.831 --> 01:19:15.292
-What have you done?
-Come on.

01:19:15.334 --> 01:19:18.045
What? Oh, my God!

01:19:18.087 --> 01:19:20.631
Daddy? Daddy?

01:19:20.673 --> 01:19:23.259
-Oh, my God. Daddy?
-[Marlene] Oh!

01:19:24.134 --> 01:19:25.720
Mama.

01:19:25.761 --> 01:19:27.304
Oh, my God.

01:19:27.346 --> 01:19:28.931
Mama! Mama!

01:19:28.972 --> 01:19:31.016
Mama? Mama? Mama, are you okay?

01:19:31.058 --> 01:19:33.185
-He pushed me down.
-Who did?

01:19:33.227 --> 01:19:34.687
Whit.

01:19:39.024 --> 01:19:41.318
-Whit.
-You were right.

01:19:41.360 --> 01:19:44.280
Rick manipulated them.
They had become threats.

01:19:45.615 --> 01:19:47.408
What did you do, Whit?

01:19:47.450 --> 01:19:49.868
I love you, Jamie.

01:19:49.910 --> 01:19:51.078
How could you do this to us?

01:19:51.120 --> 01:19:53.122
I know this is a lot
for you. Okay?

01:19:53.163 --> 01:19:55.374
I tried to shield you from it.

01:20:04.300 --> 01:20:07.010
Hey, Preston, stay here, okay?

01:20:07.052 --> 01:20:09.472
-What's happening?
-I don't know.

01:20:09.513 --> 01:20:11.974
But lock the doors behind me
when I get out, okay?

01:20:12.015 --> 01:20:13.225
Mm-hmm.

01:20:18.981 --> 01:20:20.399
[door lock clicks]

01:20:31.786 --> 01:20:34.705
You're sick, Whit.

01:20:34.747 --> 01:20:37.416
Did it ever occur to you
that maybe you're the crazy ones

01:20:37.458 --> 01:20:39.585
and I'm the only sane one
in this family?

01:20:39.627 --> 01:20:42.338
-Did it?
-[Casey] Whit!

01:20:45.382 --> 01:20:46.842
Hey, calm down, Casey.

01:20:46.883 --> 01:20:48.051
I don't wanna shoot you, cuz.

01:20:48.093 --> 01:20:51.597
I'm not who you think I am,
okay?

01:20:51.639 --> 01:20:53.015
-Let's just talk this through.
-Hey.

01:20:53.056 --> 01:20:54.517
Just you and me.

01:20:54.558 --> 01:20:57.812
-[groans]
-No! Casey? Casey?

01:20:57.853 --> 01:21:00.815
-Shh! Shh! No. Shh!
-[groans]

01:21:00.856 --> 01:21:04.610
Come on. Shh! Shh! Shh!
Stop. Stop, Jamie, stop.

01:21:04.652 --> 01:21:08.071
-I need to protect you, okay?
-Then why are you doing this?

01:21:08.113 --> 01:21:11.492
Because sometimes you need a
little protection from yourself.

01:21:11.534 --> 01:21:14.620
Whit. Whit, you just need help.

01:21:14.662 --> 01:21:17.122
Okay? You're hurting me.

01:21:17.164 --> 01:21:19.375
[laughs]

01:21:19.416 --> 01:21:20.793
You said that same thing
in the basement

01:21:20.835 --> 01:21:23.045
when you were a little girl.

01:21:23.713 --> 01:21:25.506
Don't cry.

01:21:25.548 --> 01:21:27.090
Please don't hurt me, Whit.

01:21:27.132 --> 01:21:28.467
I won't hurt you,

01:21:28.509 --> 01:21:30.177
but stop your crying, Jamie.

01:21:30.219 --> 01:21:33.681
Please, let me go. I don't
want to play this game anymore.

01:21:33.723 --> 01:21:36.141
I said, shut up!

01:21:36.183 --> 01:21:37.476
[sobbing] Oh, my God, it's you!

01:21:37.518 --> 01:21:38.811
You remember now, don't you?

01:21:38.853 --> 01:21:41.522
-Get away from me!
-[grunts]

01:21:41.564 --> 01:21:44.483
-[Rick] Jamie, get the gun.
-[Whit groans]

01:21:45.526 --> 01:21:47.737
[grunting]

01:21:51.990 --> 01:21:54.159
Rick...

01:21:54.201 --> 01:21:57.580
[groans] What are you
doing here?

01:21:57.621 --> 01:21:59.206
Stay back, Whit.

01:22:01.041 --> 01:22:03.085
I'm a trained assassin, Rick.

01:22:03.126 --> 01:22:04.461
This is a fight
you're gonna lose.

01:22:04.503 --> 01:22:05.880
Shut up, Whit.

01:22:05.921 --> 01:22:08.632
[grunting]

01:22:09.425 --> 01:22:11.719
-[gun cocks]
-Hey! Hey!

01:22:11.761 --> 01:22:13.053
What are you doing?

01:22:13.095 --> 01:22:14.722
-Whit...
-Come on, Jamie.

01:22:14.764 --> 01:22:17.099
-No. Hey.
-Stay away from me.

01:22:17.140 --> 01:22:19.560
No, no, no. We can leave.
We can go away from here.

01:22:19.602 --> 01:22:22.062
-Stay back.
-We can take Preston.

01:22:22.104 --> 01:22:23.731
-No.
-No, right now.

01:22:23.773 --> 01:22:25.274
-Right now we'll run away.
-No.

01:22:25.315 --> 01:22:27.735
Please,
where no one can hurt you.

01:22:30.404 --> 01:22:33.073
-What do you say?
-I say...

01:22:33.115 --> 01:22:34.700
[gunshot]

01:22:41.707 --> 01:22:43.918
I'm sick of running.

01:22:48.297 --> 01:22:50.424
-Rick?
-[Rick groaning]

01:22:52.885 --> 01:22:54.637
Jamie.

01:22:54.678 --> 01:22:57.055
-Are you okay? Did he hurt you?
-No.

01:22:57.097 --> 01:22:58.557
He's been planning this
from months, Jamie.

01:22:58.599 --> 01:23:01.143
-I never cheated on you.
-I know, I'm sorry.

01:23:03.562 --> 01:23:05.105
Where's Preston?

01:23:05.147 --> 01:23:06.857
-Preston?
-Preston?

01:23:07.650 --> 01:23:09.652
-Preston?
-Preston?

01:23:09.693 --> 01:23:11.695
-Preston?
-Preston?

01:23:11.737 --> 01:23:13.572
-Preston?
-Preston?

01:23:13.614 --> 01:23:16.116
-Preston!
-Preston!

01:23:18.619 --> 01:23:20.579
Preston?

01:23:20.621 --> 01:23:22.748
-Oh...
-Preston?

01:23:24.834 --> 01:23:26.251
Preston?

01:23:26.293 --> 01:23:29.087
-Preston!
-Mommy! Daddy!

01:23:29.129 --> 01:23:31.632
-Oh, buddy. Buddy, come here.
-Preston? Preston.

01:23:31.674 --> 01:23:33.968
-Oh!
-Oh!

01:23:34.009 --> 01:23:35.845
Baby, are you okay?

01:23:35.886 --> 01:23:38.555
-Where did you go?
-I ran and hid.

01:23:38.597 --> 01:23:40.933
-Oh.
-That's my boy. Attaboy.

01:23:50.985 --> 01:23:52.611
[Casey] Special omelet.

01:23:52.653 --> 01:23:54.279
That looks good.

01:23:54.321 --> 01:23:55.781
You need to get
a proper cutting knife.

01:23:55.823 --> 01:23:57.199
[Boone] All right,
this is, this is...

01:23:57.240 --> 01:23:59.284
Would you guys stay away...

01:23:59.326 --> 01:24:01.036
Step back from the bananas.

01:24:01.077 --> 01:24:03.580
-Okay.
-That is a butter knife.

01:24:03.622 --> 01:24:05.081
