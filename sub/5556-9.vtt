00:00.600 --> 00:02.800
You must not watch this.

00:06.800 --> 00:08.800
I'm warning you.

00:09.000 --> 00:11.140
You can never unsee it.

00:13.000 --> 00:15.070
But if you do watch...

00:16.000 --> 00:18.950
...Gagan Rassmussen. I'm Gagan Rassmussen.

00:19.000 --> 00:22.400
This is Le Verrier lab
in orbit around Neptune.

00:25.000 --> 00:27.950
I've put things together
into some kind of order

00:28.000 --> 00:29.950
so that you can understand,

00:30.000 --> 00:30.950
so you can have some idea.

00:31.000 --> 00:34.950
There are bits missing. Sorry about that.

00:35.000 --> 00:38.000
I don't fully understand
what's been going on here.

00:39.000 --> 00:40.470
But, er...

00:41.000 --> 00:43.070
This is what happened.

00:52.000 --> 00:53.950
Stop staring!

00:54.000 --> 00:55.950
'They came from Triton.

00:56.000 --> 00:56.950
'This is Chopra.

00:57.000 --> 00:59.950
'Bit of an attitude, in my opinion.'

01:00.000 --> 01:02.000
Calm down, pet!

01:03.000 --> 01:04.950
Well, it's ridiculous!

01:05.000 --> 01:06.960
That thing's meant to be
a lethal fighting machine

01:07.000 --> 01:08.950
and it just moons around
like a love-sick puppy!

01:09.000 --> 01:09.950
I could hear you ranting

01:10.000 --> 01:12.950
- from inside the pod, Chopra, for the Gods' sake!
- Feel better?

01:13.000 --> 01:14.950
'Commander Nagata.

01:15.000 --> 01:16.950
'Young, for the responsibility.

01:17.000 --> 01:18.950
'Quite a baptism of fire, I'm afraid.'

01:19.000 --> 01:21.950
Marvellous, ma'am. All hail, Morpheus, eh?

01:22.000 --> 01:23.950
'Deep-Ando. Conscript.

01:24.000 --> 01:25.950
'Likes to think of himself as
the joker of this little group.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.950
'Well... he DID...'

01:28.000 --> 01:29.950
Morpheus, Morpheus, Morpheus...

01:30.000 --> 01:30.950
Sleep's the one thing left to us.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.950
The one thing they couldn't
get their filthy mitts on.

01:34.000 --> 01:36.950
Now, they're even grabbing
that! Colonising it.

01:37.000 --> 01:39.950
- Spoken like a true Rip!
- Don't call me that.

01:40.000 --> 01:43.950
- "Don't call me that, ma'am." Give it a rest, pet.
- Give what a rest?

01:44.000 --> 01:46.950
This is a mission, Chopra. We find
out what's happened on Le Verrier

01:47.000 --> 01:49.950
and then we all go home. Keep
your politics to yourself, OK?

01:50.000 --> 01:52.950
I know someone who'd love to get Chopra

01:53.000 --> 01:53.950
- back home to Triton, eh?
- Ho-ho!

01:54.000 --> 01:56.950
'This one's obvious from
the markings, isn't it?

01:57.000 --> 02:00.950
'We all know a Grunt when we see one.'

02:01.000 --> 02:02.800
Come on. Behave.

02:09.000 --> 02:11.070
Nearly there, kiddies.

02:12.000 --> 02:13.950
'These are the rescue crew.

02:14.000 --> 02:15.950
'Don't get too attached.

02:16.000 --> 02:19.950
'Everything you're about to see is
from their individual viewpoints

02:20.000 --> 02:23.950
'or taken from the station itself
...the only footage available.'

02:24.000 --> 02:25.950
They came to find me.

02:26.000 --> 02:27.950
This is my station.

02:28.000 --> 02:29.340
My lab.

02:33.000 --> 02:36.600
'I've pieced together the
rescue as best I could.

02:37.000 --> 02:40.950
'If you're going to watch,
then... pay close attention.

02:41.000 --> 02:43.470
'Your lives may depend on it.'

02:50.000 --> 02:51.950
Emergency lighting only.

02:52.000 --> 02:55.300
Grav and orbit's stable.
There must be power.

03:01.000 --> 03:02.400
Nothing?

03:05.000 --> 03:06.870
No sign of anyone.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.000
There was no crew.

03:12.000 --> 03:13.670
No crew left.

03:15.000 --> 03:17.470
They did find others, though.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.470
Strangers.

03:21.000 --> 03:23.950
What the hell happened here?

03:24.000 --> 03:26.950
- Hide seek.
- Maybe they play hide seek.

03:27.000 --> 03:30.950
Hide AND seek! Why do they miss
out words? It's infuriating!

03:31.000 --> 03:32.950
Chopra, don't be anger.

03:33.000 --> 03:33.950
"Don't be an-gry!"

03:34.000 --> 03:37.950
Is it so hard to breed
them to speak properly?

03:38.000 --> 03:39.740
Oh, lighten up!

03:41.000 --> 03:42.950
- What now?
- Talk.

03:43.000 --> 03:43.950
- What?
- People talk.

03:44.000 --> 03:46.950
Do you ever get the feeling
like you're being watched?

03:47.000 --> 03:47.950
Paranoia!

03:48.000 --> 03:49.950
- Why is it so dark?
- Night-time setting.

03:50.000 --> 03:52.950
Faulty filament. Three-day week.

03:53.000 --> 03:55.950
- So, orbit around Neptune?
- Yeah. This close into the planet,

03:56.000 --> 03:59.950
they must have some pretty powerful
anti-grav shielding on board.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.950
Looks like a Japanese restaurant.

04:03.000 --> 04:05.950
Oh! Have you brought me
to a space restaurant!?

04:06.000 --> 04:08.950
- People never do that, you know?
- Do what?

04:09.000 --> 04:11.950
They never put the word
"space" in front of something

04:12.000 --> 04:15.950
just because everything's all
sort of hi-tech and future-y.

04:16.000 --> 04:17.959
It's never "space restaurant"
or "space champagne"

04:18.000 --> 04:20.950
or "space"... you know..."hat".

04:21.000 --> 04:22.950
It's just "restaurant",
"champagne" or "hat".

04:23.000 --> 04:24.950
Even if this was a restaurant...

04:25.000 --> 04:27.950
- What about spacesuit?
- Pedant!

04:33.000 --> 04:35.070
- Hello!
- You crew?

04:37.000 --> 04:39.000
Are you crew?

04:45.000 --> 04:47.950
"Engineering stress assessors"?

04:48.000 --> 04:51.000
Yes, yes, we are.

04:52.000 --> 04:55.950
- We're here to, er...
- We're here to, er... to, er...

04:56.000 --> 04:58.000
...assess stress...

05:00.000 --> 05:02.950
- So, what happened?
- From the beginning of time?

05:03.000 --> 05:04.950
- That's a very long story.
- (Doctor...!)

05:05.000 --> 05:08.950
Well, we just arrived, you know,
and there was nobody about.

05:09.000 --> 05:11.470
Well, what are you doing here?

05:15.000 --> 05:17.950
24 hours ago, this station fell silent.

05:18.000 --> 05:19.950
No comm signal. Nothing. Dead.

05:20.000 --> 05:21.950
We've come to find out why.

05:22.000 --> 05:24.950
Theories?

05:25.000 --> 05:26.950
Could be anything. Meteorite strike.

05:27.000 --> 05:27.950
Space pirates...

05:28.000 --> 05:30.950
Ah, see? Not just
"pirates". "SPACE pirates"!

05:31.000 --> 05:33.950
- So, what, you are a rescue mission?
- Yes.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.200
- Of four?
- Cuts, pet.

05:37.000 --> 05:39.950
Right. You're to consider yourself...

05:40.000 --> 05:41.950
♪ Part of the furniture! ♪

05:42.000 --> 05:44.950
...under my command.

05:45.000 --> 05:46.950
- OK. Really?
- Yes, really.

05:47.000 --> 05:48.400
Come on.

05:51.950 --> 05:52.950
We still don't know where we are.

05:53.000 --> 05:55.000
Indo-Japanese.

05:58.000 --> 06:00.000
38th century.

06:02.000 --> 06:05.000
- Tuesday.
- 38th century?

06:06.000 --> 06:08.950
After the Great Catastrophe,
there was a tectonic realignment.

06:09.000 --> 06:11.470
India and Japan, they were...

06:12.000 --> 06:13.950
...sort of merged.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.950
We still don't know where the
rest of the crew are, though.

06:16.000 --> 06:16.950
I mean, a place this size...

06:17.000 --> 06:18.950
Hey, what? "Great Catastrophe"?

06:19.000 --> 06:21.200
What Great Catastrophe?!

06:22.000 --> 06:25.950
Well... You've got all that to
look forward to, haven't you?

06:26.000 --> 06:27.950
Mind you,

06:28.000 --> 06:31.000
this place looks as if it's
been dead for a long while now.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.540
What is it?

06:44.000 --> 06:45.950
I still can't shake the feeling.

06:46.000 --> 06:47.950
Eyes. Watch.

06:48.000 --> 06:49.950
Eyes in sky.

06:50.000 --> 06:51.950
What the hell is that supposed to mean?

06:52.000 --> 06:55.000
Chopra not worry. 474 protect Chopra.

06:57.000 --> 06:58.950
Chopra pretty.

06:59.000 --> 06:59.950
Oh, for the Gods'...

07:00.000 --> 07:00.950
Just back off!

07:01.000 --> 07:03.950
Oh, come on now...

07:04.000 --> 07:05.950
- Let him go, pet!
- 474 sorry!

07:06.000 --> 07:09.000
- Let him go, now!
- Not help it!

07:20.950 --> 07:21.950
It could have killed me!

07:22.000 --> 07:26.000
That's how they're grown. You know
that. They react to any attack.

07:27.000 --> 07:30.950
"Grown"?! They might not
give them much upstairs,

07:31.000 --> 07:32.950
but our friend here
certainly knows how to fight.

07:33.000 --> 07:35.950
You'd be glad of her in
a tight corner, I'll bet.

07:36.000 --> 07:36.950
What does she mean "grown"?

07:37.000 --> 07:38.950
She's a Grunt, Clara.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.950
They're bred in hatcheries.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.950
Cloned muscles.

07:43.000 --> 07:43.950
Low intelligence.

07:44.000 --> 07:46.270
Brute force. Instant army.

07:48.000 --> 07:49.950
That's disgusting!

07:50.000 --> 07:53.600
Well, that's how they
roll in the 38th century...

08:06.000 --> 08:07.950
(Hold my hand.)

08:08.000 --> 08:08.950
I'm OK.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.400
I'm not.

08:14.000 --> 08:15.950
- Oh, run, run, run!
- Run! Run!

08:16.000 --> 08:18.000
Follow me!

08:18.950 --> 08:19.950
Straight ahead.

08:20.000 --> 08:20.950
NO! This way!

08:21.000 --> 08:22.950
Deep-Ando!

08:23.000 --> 08:24.400
Come on!

08:25.000 --> 08:27.950
Quick! Push anything in front of
it! We've got to keep them out!

08:28.000 --> 08:30.950
Deep-Ando! We've lost him!

08:31.000 --> 08:32.950
What the hell are they?

08:33.000 --> 08:34.950
- Not pirates.
- We've got to get Deep-Ando!

08:35.000 --> 08:35.950
Where's your friend?

08:36.000 --> 08:39.799
- Deep-Ando? I dunno. He's...
- He's still out there!

08:41.000 --> 08:42.200
474!

08:59.000 --> 09:01.140
What the hell are they?

09:02.000 --> 09:03.870
Where did they go?

09:06.000 --> 09:09.950
'Chief Nagata, this is
Deep-Ando. Where did you go?

09:17.000 --> 09:21.000
'Nagata, this is Deep-Ando! May the
Gods look favourably upon you!'

09:24.000 --> 09:26.470
May the Gods... Are you there?

09:31.000 --> 09:32.950
Deep-Ando, this is Nagata.

09:33.000 --> 09:34.950
May the Gods look favourably upon you.

09:35.000 --> 09:36.950
Deep-Ando, are you there?

09:37.000 --> 09:38.950
What are you doing?

09:39.000 --> 09:39.950
Finding out what they're made of.

09:40.000 --> 09:41.950
Deep-Ando, are you there?

09:42.000 --> 09:43.950
- Send the Grunt!
- No.

09:44.000 --> 09:44.950
Why not? That's what it's for.

09:45.000 --> 09:47.950
Look, he's still out there!
You can't just abandon him.

09:48.000 --> 09:51.950
I need proper intel before I
risk anyone else. Including 474.

09:52.000 --> 09:54.950
Keep trying the comms.

09:55.000 --> 09:56.950
Deep-Ando, may the Gods
look favourably upon you.

09:57.000 --> 09:58.950
- Well?
- Organic. Definitely organic.

09:59.000 --> 10:00.950
Blood cells. Skin cells. Mucus.

10:01.000 --> 10:05.950
Deep-Ando, may the Gods look
favourably upon you. Deep-Ando...

10:06.000 --> 10:09.000
- What are these?
- "Morpheus"? - Morpheus?

10:10.000 --> 10:12.950
Named after the God of Dreams?

10:13.000 --> 10:14.950
Oh, yeah... Ooh, yeah! Not just this.

10:15.000 --> 10:18.950
- So, what are they, then? Sleep pods?
- More than that.

10:19.000 --> 10:23.950
- Deep-Ando? Deep-Ando, can you hear me?
- Keep trying.

10:24.000 --> 10:26.950
I could take a look at that, you
know. Triangulate the signal.

10:27.000 --> 10:30.950
- Help you find your friend.
- First, tell me what those things are.

10:31.000 --> 10:32.950
- Deep... Deep-Ando?
- 'This is Deep...'

10:33.000 --> 10:34.950
Deep-Ando, this is Chopra.

10:35.000 --> 10:35.950
...I'm getting a signal!

10:36.000 --> 10:36.950
Deep-Ando can you hear me?

10:37.000 --> 10:39.950
Deep-Ando? Deep-Ando, this is Chopra.

12:34.000 --> 12:37.000
It's OK.

12:42.000 --> 12:44.950
'Ah, this is where I come in.'

12:45.000 --> 12:46.950
Hello.

12:47.000 --> 12:48.950
I wanted to get out of there.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.950
Immediately. Of course I did.

12:52.000 --> 12:54.470
But this man... the Doctor...

12:56.000 --> 12:58.600
.. he wanted explanations first.

12:59.000 --> 13:01.000
So...

13:04.000 --> 13:07.000
May the Gods look favourably upon us all!

13:08.000 --> 13:11.950
Friends. We live in a time
of unparalleled prosperity.

13:12.000 --> 13:16.000
A golden age of peace,
harmony and industry...

13:18.000 --> 13:22.000
But every shift must come to an
end. Every working day must stop.

13:24.000 --> 13:27.950
Of course, we can take
stimulants to make that deadline,

13:28.000 --> 13:30.950
to keep us propped up through
that important meeting.

13:31.000 --> 13:32.950
But always, always,

13:33.000 --> 13:34.950
sleep claims us in the end.

13:35.000 --> 13:35.950
Until now!

13:36.000 --> 13:38.950
Sleep-deprivation pods?

13:39.000 --> 13:40.600
Not exactly.

13:41.000 --> 13:42.950
Welcome, Morpheus.

13:43.000 --> 13:44.950
♪ Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom... ♪

13:45.000 --> 13:47.950
The Morpheus machine concentrates
the whole nocturnal experience

13:48.000 --> 13:50.950
into one five-minute burst.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.950
Now, you can go a whole
month without sleep!

13:53.000 --> 13:55.950
- A month?
- All the chemical benefits of rest,

13:56.000 --> 14:00.950
but freeing up the nights to
continue working, working, working!

14:01.000 --> 14:02.950
To get the edge on your competitor.

14:03.000 --> 14:04.950
To turn that extra profit.

14:05.000 --> 14:06.950
That's insane. That's HORRIBLE!

14:07.000 --> 14:09.950
Finally, someone who
sees it for what it is!

14:10.000 --> 14:11.950
Leave the Rip Van Winkles behind

14:12.000 --> 14:15.950
and become one of the new
generation of Wide-Awakes!

14:16.000 --> 14:17.950
The future is here.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.870
The future is now.

14:21.000 --> 14:25.950
Let yourself slip into...
the arms of Morpheus!

14:26.000 --> 14:28.950
- But sleep is...
- Terms and conditions apply.

14:29.000 --> 14:31.950
Sleep is vital. Sleep is
wonderful. Even I sleep.

14:32.000 --> 14:32.950
When?!

14:33.000 --> 14:35.470
Well, when you're not looking.

14:37.000 --> 14:40.950
Morpheus is mine. My invention.

14:41.000 --> 14:43.950
It's changed Triton society forever.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.950
So, how does it work?

14:46.000 --> 14:48.950
The pod sends out a
coded electronic signal

14:49.000 --> 14:51.950
that acts on certain parts of the brain.

14:52.000 --> 14:53.950
Changes the fundamental chemistry.

14:54.000 --> 14:55.950
It's disgusting!

14:56.000 --> 14:57.950
Making people into bloody drones!

14:58.000 --> 15:00.950
- I've said it before...
- Aye. You have.

15:01.000 --> 15:02.950
Colonising our sleep! Is nothing sacred?

15:03.000 --> 15:06.950
We spend a third of our lives
asleep. And time is money.

15:07.000 --> 15:08.950
He's right, man! It's amazing.

15:09.000 --> 15:10.950
Everyone on Triton's using it.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.000
Are they now?

15:14.000 --> 15:17.950
"Sleep, that knits up the
ravelled sleeve of care.

15:18.000 --> 15:20.950
"The death of each day's life,

15:21.000 --> 15:21.950
"sore labour's bath.

15:22.000 --> 15:23.950
"Balm of hurt minds,

15:24.000 --> 15:28.000
"chief nourisher in life's great feast."

15:29.000 --> 15:30.950
Congratulations, Professor!

15:31.000 --> 15:33.950
You've revolutionised the labour market!

15:34.000 --> 15:36.950
- You've conquered nature!
- Thank you.

15:37.000 --> 15:39.740
You've also created an abomination.

15:41.000 --> 15:43.950
The Doctor said that we had
to find the other soldier.

15:44.000 --> 15:45.950
And to find answers.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.950
So, we left the lab.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.950
He thought that there was
some connection between

15:51.000 --> 15:55.000
my Morpheus process and those
creatures that attacked us.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.950
Anyway, you'll see. He...

15:59.000 --> 16:01.000
He had a theory.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.950
- "Sleep dust"?! - Sleep
dust. - You're kidding!

16:05.000 --> 16:05.950
Do I look like I'm kidding?

16:06.000 --> 16:08.950
Is this a kidding face? Ask the crew
of this station if they're kidding.

16:09.000 --> 16:10.950
Or what's left of them.

16:11.000 --> 16:13.950
- But sleep dust?
- Yes. The stuff in the corner of your eye.

16:14.000 --> 16:15.950
The stuff you wipe away every
morning when you wake up.

16:16.000 --> 16:18.950
That's ridiculous. This
is getting us nowhere.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.950
OK, how, Doctor, how can those
things be made of "sleep dust"?

16:22.000 --> 16:24.950
Well, when we sleep, the mucus
crust builds up in our eyes.

16:25.000 --> 16:28.950
Blood cells. Skin cells. That's
what dust largely is. Human skin.

16:29.000 --> 16:30.950
But your meddling has
evolved it. Hot-housed it.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.950
What used to be sleep in your eye

16:33.000 --> 16:35.950
has turned into a carnivorous life form!

16:36.000 --> 16:38.950
You can't just throw
accusations like that around!

16:39.000 --> 16:41.950
So, the longer you're in Morpheus,
the more the dust builds up?

16:42.000 --> 16:42.950
That's slander!

16:43.000 --> 16:46.950
Lying there in those pods, people
are a ready-made food source.

16:47.000 --> 16:47.950
Where are they, then?

16:48.000 --> 16:49.950
Where's the crew?

16:50.000 --> 16:51.470
Digested.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.740
Come on, we need to find Deep-Ando.

16:59.000 --> 17:00.950
Come on.

17:01.000 --> 17:02.950
Oh, come on.

17:03.000 --> 17:06.950
Must be an exit here somewhere.

17:07.000 --> 17:08.950
Listen to me.

17:09.000 --> 17:11.670
Those things. They're everywhere.

17:12.000 --> 17:14.800
For the Gods' sake, come and get me.

17:26.000 --> 17:28.950
What about us? We've all
used the pods back on Triton.

17:29.000 --> 17:32.950
- Not all of us.
- This isn't a good time to be smug, pet.

17:33.000 --> 17:36.950
My guess is that the ones you're
using are pretty primitive

17:37.000 --> 17:37.950
compared to what's going on up here.

17:38.000 --> 17:40.950
These are a sort of a Mark II, yeah?

17:41.000 --> 17:43.950
Obviously, I have tried
to improve the process.

17:44.000 --> 17:44.950
Speed things up.

17:45.000 --> 17:46.950
You've succeeded there.

17:47.000 --> 17:49.950
But how does the dust
become those creatures?

17:50.000 --> 17:51.950
You saw what happened.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.950
The dust conglomerates. It moulds
itself into a humanoid form.

17:55.000 --> 17:57.950
It's adaptable. It's clever.

18:02.000 --> 18:03.950
And it's coming for us.

18:04.000 --> 18:08.000
Look, you came to rescue the
crew. I'm crew. So, rescue me!

18:10.000 --> 18:12.670
How come you're the only one left?

18:13.000 --> 18:14.950
Because I hid.

18:15.000 --> 18:17.950
I hid in the only place I thought
those monsters wouldn't find me.

18:18.000 --> 18:18.950
Look, we've got to get out of here!

18:19.000 --> 18:21.950
No. We can't leave this place until
there's not a trace of the dust

18:22.000 --> 18:23.950
or your machines left.
Or that's it for your lot.

18:24.000 --> 18:25.950
Our lot? What do you mean?

18:26.000 --> 18:29.000
Oh, the human race.

18:57.950 --> 18:58.950
'Hey.'

18:59.000 --> 19:00.950
Haruka Deep-Ando, 6897. Let me in.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.950
'I'd love to.'

19:03.000 --> 19:07.950
Well, do it then! My ID must
be on the Corporation index.

19:08.000 --> 19:08.950
'You have to do the song.'

19:09.000 --> 19:10.950
What?!

19:11.000 --> 19:13.950
'You have to do the song, Deep-Ando 6897.'

19:14.000 --> 19:15.950
I haven't got time for this!

19:16.000 --> 19:17.950
'Do the song, please.'

19:18.000 --> 19:19.950
What the hell are you talking about?

19:20.000 --> 19:23.950
'After the Maha
Shivaratri/Oshogasu/Christmas party

19:28.000 --> 19:31.950
'Yes. In order to enter rooms,
everyone must do the song.

19:32.000 --> 19:34.000

19:35.000 --> 19:36.950
But you know who I am! You
just called me by my name.

19:37.000 --> 19:40.950
'Nevertheless...'

19:41.000 --> 19:41.950

19:42.000 --> 19:43.950
'You know the one.'

19:44.000 --> 19:45.400
I don't!

19:46.000 --> 19:48.950
'Now you're just being
silly. Of course you do!

19:49.000 --> 19:51.950
'Silly Deep-Ando 6897.

'You must know the song.

23:24.000 --> 23:26.950
Oh, God. Of all the places! A cold store.

23:27.000 --> 23:27.950
Nagata, are you OK?

23:28.000 --> 23:29.600
No, I'm not.

23:31.000 --> 23:33.950
- What about the others? - I don't
know. - We have to go after them!

23:34.000 --> 23:35.950
- Don't be ridiculous.
- Doctor!

23:36.000 --> 23:38.950
They're under my command!
I owe it to them.

23:39.000 --> 23:41.950
To die? They wouldn't thank you for that.

23:42.000 --> 23:43.950
Nor you, Clara.

23:44.000 --> 23:44.950
"To die, to die.

"Macbeth shall sleep no more."

23:55.000 --> 23:56.950
Shakespeare.

23:57.000 --> 23:58.950
He really knew his stuff.

23:59.000 --> 24:03.000
They all did. The Ancients. The poets.

24:04.000 --> 24:07.100
All those sad songs. All those lullabies.

24:09.000 --> 24:12.950
Sleep is essential to every
sentient being in the universe.

24:13.000 --> 24:18.000
But to humans... greedy,
filthy, stupid humans...

24:20.000 --> 24:22.950
...it's an inconvenience
to be bartered away!

24:23.000 --> 24:25.950
Well, now we know the truth.

24:26.000 --> 24:29.000
Sleep isn't just a function. It's blessed.

24:32.000 --> 24:35.000
Every night we dive
deep into that inky pool.

24:37.000 --> 24:38.950
Deep into the arms of Morpheus.

24:39.000 --> 24:42.950
Every morning, we wake up and
wipe the sleep from our eyes.

24:43.000 --> 24:44.950
And that keeps us safe.

24:45.000 --> 24:47.950
Safe from the monsters inside.

24:48.000 --> 24:51.950
Well, the bloody monsters are
outside now. What do we do?!

25:13.000 --> 25:14.470
Dead meat.

25:23.000 --> 25:25.950
Dear Gods, what are we going to do?

25:26.000 --> 25:27.870
Get ship. Go home.

25:29.000 --> 25:30.950
We can't let those things off here!

25:31.000 --> 25:34.950
If they were to get out, to
spread... It's like an infection.

25:35.000 --> 25:37.470
You don't understand, do you?

25:37.950 --> 25:38.950
Sleepmen bad.

25:39.000 --> 25:40.950
Kill sleepmen.

25:41.000 --> 25:43.400
Yeah. That about sums it up.

25:45.950 --> 25:46.950
Chief Nagata, this is Chopra.

25:47.000 --> 25:49.870
May the Gods look favourably upon you.

25:51.000 --> 25:54.000
Chief Nagata, this is Chopra. May the...

25:55.000 --> 25:57.950
We'll head for the rescue ship.

25:58.000 --> 25:59.950
If we don't hear from them soon,

26:00.000 --> 26:01.950
I'm going to have to assume they're dead.

26:02.000 --> 26:04.950
Then what Chopra do?

26:05.000 --> 26:06.870
I have no choice.

26:08.000 --> 26:11.000
I'll have to destroy this whole station.

26:18.000 --> 26:20.950
- What are you doing?
- I've hacked into your helmet cams.

26:21.000 --> 26:22.950
- What?
- Reviewing the footage.

26:23.000 --> 26:25.950
- There's something not right here.
- We don't have helmet cams.

26:26.000 --> 26:27.950
Why did it kill Rassmussen like that?

26:28.000 --> 26:31.950
That's what they do,
isn't it? Kill people?

26:32.000 --> 26:33.950
But that's a direct attack.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.950
It's not how they operate. Dust grows.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.950
Consumes the host.

26:39.000 --> 26:40.950
They evolve. You said so yourself.

26:41.000 --> 26:44.950
Maybe. There's something going on here.

26:45.000 --> 26:47.400
Something we're not getting.

26:49.000 --> 26:50.950
'Please stand clear of the pod.

26:51.000 --> 26:52.950
'Dangerous materials in transit.'

26:53.000 --> 26:54.950
What now? We can't stay in here.

26:55.000 --> 26:55.950
We're going to freeze to death.

26:56.000 --> 26:59.000
And we can't go back out there
because the Sandmen will get us.

27:03.000 --> 27:04.950
"Sandmen"?

27:05.000 --> 27:06.950
Yeah, it's a good name.

27:07.000 --> 27:09.950
It fits. Like the song.
♪ Bah, bah, bah... ♪

27:10.000 --> 27:13.000
No, you don't get to name things.
I'm the Doctor. I do the naming!

27:15.000 --> 27:16.870
All right. Sorry.

27:17.000 --> 27:18.950
It's like the Silurians all over again!

27:19.000 --> 27:22.000
OK, well, what would you
prefer then? The "Dustmen"?

27:24.000 --> 27:25.470
(Sandmen.)

27:27.000 --> 27:30.000
- What did you just say?
- When? - 1.83 minutes ago.

27:32.000 --> 27:34.670
I said we don't have helmet cams.

27:50.000 --> 27:52.950
Doctor, that door isn't
going to last much longer.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.870
So, what do we do?

27:57.000 --> 27:58.950
We let them in.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.270
What?!

28:01.000 --> 28:02.740
We let them in.

28:04.000 --> 28:05.950
Hmm. Clever, that.

28:06.000 --> 28:06.950
Clever strategy.

28:07.000 --> 28:09.950
If they'd stayed in there,
they'd have frozen to death.

28:10.000 --> 28:13.000
So, the Doctor had to let the
creatures in. That was his theory.

28:15.000 --> 28:17.000
Oh, I'm not dead.

28:18.000 --> 28:20.800
You've probably guessed that by now.

28:42.000 --> 28:43.950
What happen?

28:44.000 --> 28:47.300
Must be damage from when
we fell out of orbit.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.000
We have to go back.

28:56.000 --> 29:00.000
I don't know what to do. I can't save us.

29:02.000 --> 29:05.000
- 474 can.
- What?!

29:24.000 --> 29:26.950
The Doctor worked it out.

29:27.000 --> 29:29.340
The creatures... can't see.

29:39.000 --> 29:41.000
Sssh!

29:50.000 --> 29:54.000
Run! Engine room!

30:00.000 --> 30:01.950
What happened?

30:02.000 --> 30:04.000
474 help.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.270
What?!

30:11.000 --> 30:12.950
474... die soon.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.950
No, no! Don't say that!
You got us through!

30:16.000 --> 30:18.070
You can survive this!

30:21.000 --> 30:22.470
Chopra go.

30:23.950 --> 30:24.950
Get ship.

30:25.000 --> 30:27.000
Chopra be safe.

30:29.000 --> 30:30.670
Chopra pretty.

30:50.000 --> 30:52.000
Yaaaargh!

30:55.000 --> 30:56.950
You said you felt like you
were being watched, Clara.

30:57.000 --> 31:00.000
- "Paranoia", you said.
- Not this time.

31:05.950 --> 31:06.950
There is a feed. Wireless.

31:07.000 --> 31:10.950
These images are being
stored by someone. Collated.

31:11.000 --> 31:12.950
Nagata, look at this footage!

31:13.000 --> 31:14.950
What's wrong with it?

31:15.000 --> 31:15.950
- What's wrong with it?
- Don't know.

31:16.000 --> 31:18.950
Look, there's one very
obvious thing about it.

31:19.000 --> 31:20.950
Do you see it yet?

31:21.000 --> 31:25.000
No? OK. I'll tell you what's wrong.

31:26.000 --> 31:28.950
There's footage here of everyone.

31:29.000 --> 31:30.950
But what's missing in all of it?

31:31.000 --> 31:33.400
What can't you see anywhere?

31:34.000 --> 31:36.870
Not in the footage, not on this ship.

31:37.950 --> 31:38.950
Look...

31:39.000 --> 31:41.000
Really look.

31:43.000 --> 31:44.950
There are no cameras here.

31:45.000 --> 31:45.950
No CCTV.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.950
No helmet cams.

31:48.000 --> 31:51.000
So, how and why does
this footage even exist?

31:52.000 --> 31:54.950
The dust has been watching us.

31:55.000 --> 31:58.000
Each little organic speck...

31:59.000 --> 32:00.950
...just a tiny spy!

32:01.000 --> 32:02.950
Drifting through the air.

32:03.000 --> 32:05.950
The monsters have been with us all along.

32:06.000 --> 32:07.950
That's why the Sandmen are blind.

32:08.000 --> 32:12.000
Their visual receptors are being
hijacked! But by whom, and why?

32:13.000 --> 32:15.140
And then, there's this.

32:15.950 --> 32:16.950
That's you, Clara.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.270
That's you, looking at me.

32:21.000 --> 32:22.140
Me?

32:24.000 --> 32:26.070
You went into the pod.

32:28.000 --> 32:30.540
The Morpheus process has begun.

32:30.950 --> 32:31.950
Well...

32:32.000 --> 32:35.950
There's nothing here from
Chopra's point of view

32:36.000 --> 32:37.950
because he refuses to use Morpheus.

32:38.000 --> 32:39.950
But everybody else is here. Including you.

32:40.000 --> 32:42.540
You don't have a camera, Clara.

32:44.000 --> 32:45.950
But you will have by now,

32:46.000 --> 32:47.870
sleep in your eye.

32:49.950 --> 32:50.950
OK, well, we'll fix this.

32:51.000 --> 32:52.950
You will fix this.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.950
Yes. I'm sure it'll be fine.
I'm sure you'll be fine.

32:56.000 --> 32:57.950
Sure?

32:58.000 --> 32:59.950
We will sort this, Clara.

33:00.000 --> 33:02.950
We'll sort you. We'll sort Nagata.

33:03.000 --> 33:04.950
And everyone back on Triton.

33:05.000 --> 33:08.000
And then we will destroy Morpheus forever.

33:09.000 --> 33:10.400
OK then.

33:12.000 --> 33:14.070
Let's get on with it.

33:16.000 --> 33:18.950
The power's been almost
entirely out since we arrived.

33:19.000 --> 33:21.940
But we've still got emergency lighting.

33:23.000 --> 33:24.950
But the engines are still on.

33:25.000 --> 33:28.000
Well, there was that incident
with the grav-shields, but...

33:32.000 --> 33:33.950
Ah! What, what, what?

33:34.000 --> 33:35.950
The grav-shields didn't fail.

33:36.000 --> 33:37.950
They were deliberately powered down.

33:38.000 --> 33:40.000
By the Sandmen?

33:41.000 --> 33:43.800
Well, that's not their style, is it?

33:51.000 --> 33:54.000
It's like... It's like
something's been kept here.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.950
Near the engines. Where it's hot.

33:58.000 --> 33:59.950
Like something's being...

34:00.000 --> 34:01.540
kept alive.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.950
'Warning! Dangerous materials in transit.

34:06.000 --> 34:07.950
'Human contact not advised.

34:08.000 --> 34:11.949
'Warning! Dangerous materials in transit.

34:12.000 --> 34:14.400
'Human contact not advised.'

34:15.000 --> 34:17.949
Well, you said someone's
watching. Collating images.

34:18.000 --> 34:22.949
- Yeah. - Well, if it's not
the Sandmen, then who is it?

34:23.000 --> 34:24.949
I have an idea who.

34:25.000 --> 34:28.000
A very... nasty idea.

34:34.000 --> 34:36.949
In the absence of any further
communication with Chief Nagata

34:37.000 --> 34:42.000
and the others, I must regrettably
assume them to be deceased.

34:44.000 --> 34:47.949
Under the circumstances, I'm
now returning to the ship

34:48.000 --> 34:52.000
and will begin preparations
to destroy Le Verrier station.

35:08.000 --> 35:09.950
Who's there?

35:10.000 --> 35:11.340
Chief?!

35:36.000 --> 35:37.950
"Rescue ship"?

35:38.000 --> 35:41.000
- Why are we going to the rescue ship?
- Because that's where he'll be.

35:44.000 --> 35:45.950
'Gagan Rassmussen. I'm Gagan Rassmussen.

35:46.000 --> 35:49.000
'This is Le Verrier lab
in orbit around Neptune.

35:52.000 --> 35:54.950
'I've put things together
into some kind of order...'

35:55.000 --> 35:57.950
You had that prepared well
in advance, didn't you?

35:58.000 --> 35:59.950
Your statement.

36:00.000 --> 36:00.950
Your alibi.

36:01.000 --> 36:04.950
There would inevitably be
questions when you got to Triton.

36:05.000 --> 36:08.000
So, you needed to get your story straight.

36:09.000 --> 36:11.200
'This is what happened.'

36:15.000 --> 36:16.950
You can't fight them, Doctor.

36:17.000 --> 36:18.870
There's no point.

36:19.950 --> 36:20.950
They're the future.

36:21.000 --> 36:22.950
A new life form!

36:23.000 --> 36:24.950
A BETTER life form.

36:25.000 --> 36:26.950
That's very clear to me now.

36:27.000 --> 36:29.340
They've made me understand.

36:34.950 --> 36:35.950
And we're to be their food

36:36.000 --> 36:37.950
and that's only correct.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.950
I just needed to find a way
to get them off this station,

36:41.000 --> 36:42.950
and back to Triton. And
then, they'll spread.

36:43.000 --> 36:45.950
- Spread everywhere.
- And that's what you want?!

36:46.000 --> 36:47.950
You're helping them wipe out Humanity?

36:48.000 --> 36:49.950
Things have been made very clear to me!

36:50.000 --> 36:51.950
We saw you die!

36:52.000 --> 36:53.950
The Sandmen swallowed you...

36:54.000 --> 36:56.950
I think the Professor has been
playing a long game. Am I right?

36:57.000 --> 36:58.950
They speak to me...

36:59.000 --> 37:00.950
in my mind.

37:01.000 --> 37:03.000
Trust me, I think...

37:04.000 --> 37:06.270
But they're like children.

37:06.950 --> 37:07.950
Babies.

37:08.000 --> 37:09.340
So new.

37:11.000 --> 37:12.950
Evolving.

37:13.000 --> 37:13.950
Hungry.

37:14.000 --> 37:15.950
Always so hungry.

37:16.000 --> 37:17.950
I made them understand.

37:18.000 --> 37:19.950
We had to find a way out.

37:20.000 --> 37:21.950
And then there'd be new food sources.

37:22.000 --> 37:23.950
Unlimited.

37:24.000 --> 37:25.950
So, they spared me.

37:26.000 --> 37:27.670
And we waited.

37:29.000 --> 37:30.940
You and your cargo?

37:34.000 --> 37:37.950
I got it in here while
you were all distracted.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.000
What's in there?

37:51.000 --> 37:52.270
Dust?

37:54.000 --> 37:57.950
It's like smuggling a jam jar
full of germs through customs.

37:58.000 --> 37:58.950
No. No.

37:59.000 --> 38:01.000
More than that.

38:03.000 --> 38:04.870
What do you mean?

38:06.000 --> 38:09.950
I've been working on Morpheus
for a very long time, Doctor.

38:10.000 --> 38:11.950
I had to start somewhere.

38:12.000 --> 38:14.200
Morpheus's first client.

38:15.000 --> 38:16.670
Patient Zero.

38:18.000 --> 38:20.200
The ultimate Wide-Awake.

38:21.000 --> 38:22.950
Inside there...

38:23.000 --> 38:25.950
is a man who hasn't slept in five years.

38:26.000 --> 38:28.950
Or what's left of him.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.950
He's the well-spring.

38:31.000 --> 38:33.950
Once we get to Triton,
he will spread his spores.

38:34.000 --> 38:35.950
But you said it was an encoded signal.

38:36.000 --> 38:37.950
Something electronic
in the Morpheus process

38:38.000 --> 38:39.950
that changed the chemical
reaction in the brain.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.950
That's how it started, yes.

38:42.000 --> 38:43.950
But it's changing all the time.

38:44.000 --> 38:45.950
Evolving new ways to infect.

38:46.000 --> 38:47.950
To flourish.

38:48.000 --> 38:49.950
Whole moons, whole planets,

38:50.000 --> 38:51.950
whole civilisations.

38:52.000 --> 38:53.950
They'll spread everywhere.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.950
You know I can't allow that.

38:56.000 --> 38:57.950
You can't stop them.

38:58.000 --> 38:59.950
None of us can.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.000
I wouldn't bet on that, pet.

39:13.950 --> 39:14.950
Doctor!

39:15.000 --> 39:17.000
Doctor!

39:22.000 --> 39:23.950
What he wants is to get
that thing off this ship.

39:24.000 --> 39:26.800
- We have to stop him.
- Any ideas?

39:28.000 --> 39:30.950
The doors are not a problem.

39:31.000 --> 39:32.670
[But that is!]

39:36.000 --> 39:39.000
We need a distraction.

39:43.000 --> 39:45.950
When I say "run", run.

39:49.000 --> 39:50.950
Hey! Sandy!

39:51.000 --> 39:54.000
- ♪ Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom... ♪
- Run!

39:56.000 --> 39:58.950
♪ Bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom, bom

39:59.000 --> 40:01.950
♪ Mr Sandman, bring me your dreams... ♪

40:02.000 --> 40:03.950
Rassmussen!

40:04.000 --> 40:05.950
Turn off the engines. Shut this ship down!

40:06.000 --> 40:07.950
I can't do that, I'm afraid, Doctor.

40:08.000 --> 40:09.950
We can't fight the inevitable.
Humanity's day is done.

40:10.000 --> 40:12.950
Yeah? Well, Humanity might have
something to say about that, pet.

40:13.000 --> 40:14.950
- Aargh!
- No!

40:16.000 --> 40:19.950
- Is that your answer for everything?!
- Did you have a better one?

40:20.000 --> 40:21.950
He's not the only one dead.

40:22.000 --> 40:27.100
According to this data, we're the
only ones left alive on this station.

40:28.000 --> 40:29.470
Doctor...

40:31.000 --> 40:33.470
Come on, man! We've got to go!

40:33.950 --> 40:34.950
- This doesn't make any sense.
- What?

40:35.000 --> 40:36.950
A man who hasn't slept for five years...

40:37.000 --> 40:39.950
Well, you heard what he said.
That's the first Morpheus patient!

40:40.000 --> 40:41.950
But the dust consumes the host.

40:42.000 --> 40:43.950
And then they make
Sandmen, they conglomerate.

40:44.000 --> 40:47.950
We escaped from that cold storage
room because they were blind.

40:48.000 --> 40:49.950
And why power down the
grav-shields when he did?

40:50.000 --> 40:51.950
It's like this is all for effect...

40:52.000 --> 40:52.950
Look, can we maybe have this conversation

40:53.000 --> 40:54.950
when we get off this thing?

40:55.000 --> 40:55.950
...like a story.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.400
Come on!

41:08.000 --> 41:11.000
- How do we get off this crate?
- Alternative transport.

41:18.000 --> 41:20.950
We have to get to Triton. Destroy
all the Morpheus machines.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.950
- End this.
- This is how we get home?

41:23.000 --> 41:26.000
I've never been so pleased to see...

41:36.000 --> 41:37.340
Nagata!

41:40.000 --> 41:41.950
Doctor, quickly!

41:47.000 --> 41:49.950
- What did you just do?
- Self-destructed the grav-shields.

41:50.000 --> 41:51.950
- What?!
- Urgh!

41:59.950 --> 42:00.950
It's working!

42:01.000 --> 42:04.950
Neptune's gravity is pulling
them apart, bit by bit!

42:05.000 --> 42:05.950
Doesn't make sense.

42:06.000 --> 42:08.470
None of this makes any sense.

42:22.000 --> 42:23.950
Hello again!

42:24.000 --> 42:26.950
Thing is, you see, this
message, this testament,

42:27.000 --> 42:29.950
it wasn't just my alibi. It was my plan.

42:30.000 --> 42:31.950
There are no spores. No infection.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.950
The Morpheus process remains the same.

42:34.000 --> 42:36.950
An electronic signal that affects
the sleep centres of the brain.

42:37.000 --> 42:38.950
Changes them.

42:39.000 --> 42:41.950
An electronic signal that's
contained in this recording.

42:42.000 --> 42:43.950
There it is.

42:44.000 --> 42:44.950
Tickles, doesn't it?

42:45.000 --> 42:48.950
I've just got time to fit this bit
in and then I can finish the story.

42:49.000 --> 42:53.950
Then I'm going to transmit this
footage to the whole Solar System.

42:54.000 --> 42:54.950
I do hope you've enjoyed the show.

42:55.000 --> 42:57.950
I did try to make it exciting.
All those scary bits.

42:58.000 --> 42:59.950
All those death-defying scrapes,

43:00.000 --> 43:02.950
monsters, and a proper climax
with a really big one at the end!

43:03.000 --> 43:03.950
Compulsive viewing.

43:04.000 --> 43:07.000
I did tell you not to watch.

43:12.000 --> 43:15.000
There's nothing left
of Rassmussen any more.

43:16.000 --> 43:17.400
Only us.

43:19.000 --> 43:20.400
Only us.

43:21.000 --> 43:23.950
You will show this film
to your family, won't you?

43:24.000 --> 43:25.950
And your friends.

43:26.000 --> 43:27.950
And everyone, really.

43:28.000 --> 43:31.950
Then we can all be together,

43:32.000 --> 43:34.000
dust to dust.

43:36.000 --> 43:37.950
Excuse me,

43:38.000 --> 43:39.950
you've got something...

43:40.000 --> 43:42.000
there...

43:44.000 --> 43:46.670
...just in the corner of your eye.

44:00.000 --> 44:01.950
Rigsy! Hey, what's wrong?

44:02.000 --> 44:04.950
So, I have this, er... It
kinda looks like a tattoo.

44:05.000 --> 44:07.950
- There's no nice way to say
you're about to die. - What?!

44:08.000 --> 44:09.950
I don't know who did this to you,

44:10.000 --> 44:13.950
but I do almost certainly
know how to find them.

44:14.000 --> 44:16.950
So, this is your life, then,
bouncing around time saving people?

44:17.000 --> 44:20.950
There have always been rumours,
mutterings about hidden streets.

44:21.000 --> 44:23.950
Secret pockets of alien
life, right here on Earth.

44:24.000 --> 44:26.950
Peace on this street depends on one thing.

44:27.000 --> 44:29.000
To break it is to face the Raven.

44:30.305 --> 44:36.495
