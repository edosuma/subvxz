Buffy the Vampire Slayer.

00:05.238 --> 00:07.674
You're never here.
You can't even stand
to be around me.

00:07.708 --> 00:09.210
That is not true.

00:09.243 --> 00:12.712
You didn't want to come back.
I know that.

00:12.746 --> 00:14.414
You want
to go away again.

00:14.448 --> 00:16.917
Come in.
Ante up.

00:16.949 --> 00:19.018
You're gonna play cards?

00:20.454 --> 00:23.423
I have been called,
and vengeance shall I reap.

00:23.457 --> 00:25.492
- [ Gasps ]
- Hello.

00:25.525 --> 00:27.928
- Halfrek.
- Anyanka?

00:27.960 --> 00:29.562
Ah!
Hey!

00:29.597 --> 00:33.567
- How are you?
- You two--
you know each other?

00:33.600 --> 00:35.435
Funny, Halfrek.
I didn't summon you
to kill Xander.

00:35.469 --> 00:36.869
I called to invite you
to our wedding.

00:38.139 --> 00:39.273
Tara.

00:39.307 --> 00:41.075
What are you doing here?

00:41.109 --> 00:43.676
Uh, it's okay
for you to be here
if you have things...

00:43.710 --> 00:45.878
that you have to
be here for.

00:45.912 --> 00:49.716
I'm doing better.
No spells for 32 days.

00:49.750 --> 00:51.784
Buffy, uh, I promise,
there's nothing wrong
with you.

00:51.819 --> 00:53.454
There has to be.

00:53.487 --> 00:56.223
Why do I feel like this?

00:56.256 --> 00:59.960
Why do I let Spike
do those things to me?

00:59.993 --> 01:01.395
Oh.

01:01.429 --> 01:03.831
- Don't tell anyone, please.
- I won't.

01:05.832 --> 01:09.537
[ Sighs ]
I'm sorry.

01:09.569 --> 01:13.373
It's okay.
No. We're gonna sit down and
have a real dinner-- someday.

01:13.406 --> 01:15.608
I hate having to
run out in the middle.

01:15.643 --> 01:18.545
It's just, you know,
 there's this thing out there.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.513
Definitely non-vampire.
I understand.

01:22.750 --> 01:27.287
Well, maybe when you
get back, we can set up
for your party tomorrow.

01:27.320 --> 01:31.459
Yeah. Uh, this could take
a while, though.
I wouldn't wait up.

01:31.492 --> 01:34.728
Besides, Willow promised to be
on birthday patrol, so there's
nothing left for us to do.

01:34.762 --> 01:38.299
- Right.
- Okay, so finish dinner,
homework,

01:38.331 --> 01:41.402
- and don't stay up
too late, all right?
- Okay.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.271
Okay.

[ Roaring ]

[ Roaring ]

02:30.884 --> 02:35.288
Run off, huh?
Afraid to face a true warrior?

02:35.323 --> 02:37.925
Ooh, shiny.

03:38.618 --> 03:42.256
Do you think we should
set up lots of candles
for Buffy's party tomorrow?

03:42.289 --> 03:45.759
Not if they're that
horrible slug kind
you keep trying to unload.

03:45.793 --> 03:48.429
I don't know why people
get so turned off by slug.

03:48.461 --> 03:50.764
Honey, slugs get
turned off by slug.

03:50.798 --> 03:54.468
- Oh, actually, I wanted to
talk to you about that.
- Slugs?

03:54.502 --> 03:59.639
- No, the party--
or Tara at the party.
- Oh.

03:59.673 --> 04:02.575
It's just-- Buffy really
wants her there.

04:02.610 --> 04:05.579
It seems important to her,
so I told her I'd ask you.

04:05.612 --> 04:08.649
Oh. Yeah. Of course.

04:08.681 --> 04:11.151
She should totally be there.
It'll be great.

04:11.183 --> 04:15.389
- Hey.
- Hey, Dawnie.

04:15.423 --> 04:18.391
Buffy, uh, out
patrolling already?

04:18.425 --> 04:21.261
So anything new about Warren
 and the nerd herd?

04:21.295 --> 04:23.764
No, just
a big monster hunt.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.932
Man, a nerd goes
into hiding, he really
goes into hiding.

04:25.966 --> 04:28.235
Anybody want to come to
the mall with me
for birthday presents?

04:28.268 --> 04:32.305
Oh, I would, honey,
but I've got my group.

04:32.340 --> 04:34.408
You know, the whole
 Spellcasters Anonymous thing?

04:34.442 --> 04:37.310
We're still looking
for a better name.

04:37.345 --> 04:39.245
Oh, well, yeah, uh, no.

04:39.278 --> 04:41.981
That-- That's good.
 You should do that.

04:44.718 --> 04:49.122
- So what about you guys?
- Stuck in
doing-the-books-ville.

04:49.156 --> 04:54.627
I'd love to go, but I gotta
 finish this new shift schedule
 for the crew by tomorrow.

04:54.661 --> 04:57.197
Sorry, it just looks like
one of those nights,
you know?

04:57.230 --> 04:59.367
Yeah.

04:59.399 --> 05:02.536
You okay going
 on your own?

05:02.569 --> 05:05.572
Yeah. Somehow I'll
manage to pull it off.

[ Woman ]
 If we can come up with
 things Jim lost...

06:24.785 --> 06:27.086
during his years
 in Shanghai
 and things he gained.

06:27.120 --> 06:29.389
Excuse me.

[ Woman ]
 I'm so sorry.
 I didn't mean to scare you.

06:46.973 --> 06:49.476
Just a follow-up
after your, um--

06:49.509 --> 06:51.812
your loss.

06:51.845 --> 06:54.715
Since I'm new here, I thought
it would give us a chance
to get to know each other.

06:54.747 --> 06:58.151
Great.
So I've been looking
through your file,

06:58.185 --> 07:00.920
and, um, your grades have
slipped a little.

07:00.954 --> 07:04.257
I have really hard
classes this quarter.

07:04.290 --> 07:07.627
Yeah. Still,
teachers say that you seem
a little distracted lately.

07:07.661 --> 07:10.898
I'm not.
I'm fine.

07:10.930 --> 07:14.134
Okay. It's just, you know,
I know it must seem weird--

07:14.166 --> 07:17.336
[ Chuckles ]
talking to a stranger
about stuff, but, um,

07:17.370 --> 07:20.973
I want you to know that
if something's going on,
something's up,

07:21.007 --> 07:25.278
my job-- the most
important part of my job--
is looking out for you.

07:30.350 --> 07:33.319
I'm really okay.

07:36.856 --> 07:41.360
I know there's been
a lot of loss.

07:43.863 --> 07:47.668
Yeah. Kinda.

07:47.701 --> 07:52.139
I-I mean, yes.
People keep--

07:52.172 --> 07:57.310
People have a tendency
to go away, and I miss them.

07:57.343 --> 08:00.112
And sometimes...

08:00.146 --> 08:04.250
I wish I could just
make them stop going away.

08:07.387 --> 08:12.560
But, seriously, it's--
it's no big deal. I'm fine.

[ Xander ]
We're feeding an army.

08:14.927 --> 08:17.396
No, they couldn't make it.

08:17.430 --> 08:20.533
- So who's coming?
 You invite anyone else?
- Just you guys.

08:20.567 --> 08:24.004
Willow, Tara, the gang.
Oh, and Sophie from work.

08:26.774 --> 08:28.742
What, like I'm one
of those losers

08:28.776 --> 08:30.911

No. I'm friendly.
 We bonded instantly.

Bonded peas.

Really? Um,
what's Sophie's last name?

- Okay. Shut up.
- Don't worry about it.

We're all over
the "new friend" thing.

- What "new friend" thing?
- Well, well, we invited
someone for you.

08:52.231 --> 08:55.201
[ Whispering ]
A guy.

08:55.235 --> 08:57.705
For Buffy? Really?
Ah, don't worry.
It's not a setup.

08:57.738 --> 09:00.173
Right. No.

09:00.206 --> 09:04.778
Just an attractive single man
 with whom we hope
 you find much in common.

09:04.812 --> 09:08.615
And if you happen to form
a romantic relationship
leading to babies...

09:08.649 --> 09:12.284
and many double dates with us,
 so we have someone else
 to talk to-- yea!

09:12.318 --> 09:15.554
I assume that this was
an act of kindness?

09:15.589 --> 09:18.926
That'll help
with the not throttling.

No.
He may be a chip-head,

but he still doesn't play
too well with others.

 a very good judge,

Yeah.

time, hasn't it?
Not yet, sweetie.

- And sometimes dairy.
- No problem.

15:05.404 --> 15:08.075
Our friend is better.

15:08.107 --> 15:11.443
[ Buffy ] We can do official
 introductions now that
 everyone's officially here.

15:11.477 --> 15:13.745
Dawnie,
 you mind getting the door?

15:13.779 --> 15:17.616
Sophie, this is Anya
 and Willow--

15:33.000 --> 15:35.534
Wish granted.

** [ Dance ]

16:00.326 --> 16:02.662
Hey.
Great party.
Hi.

16:02.695 --> 16:05.432
Everyone's having fun.
I hope so.

16:05.465 --> 16:08.801
I mean, look what time it is,
and no one's even
thinking about leaving.

16:08.835 --> 16:11.270
I know I can't
tear myself away.

16:11.303 --> 16:13.639
Yeah?
Yeah.

16:13.673 --> 16:17.509
Hey, can I get
you a drink?
Uh,

16:17.543 --> 16:21.280
I-I'm good.
Thank you.

16:21.313 --> 16:25.951
Okay.
I think I'll just
head back in.

16:25.985 --> 16:28.520
Well, I'll look
for you.
Okay.

16:30.722 --> 16:33.692
Ooh, Buffy.

16:33.725 --> 16:37.330
Can I get you
a soda pop?
I think I'm in love.

16:37.364 --> 16:40.767
Stop it.
Someone's gonna see.

16:43.403 --> 16:46.373
Mm-hmm.

17:01.019 --> 17:05.592
I had a muscle cramp.
Buffy was, uh, helping.

17:05.625 --> 17:10.762
A muscle cramp?
In your pants?

17:10.797 --> 17:13.165
What? It's a thing.

17:13.200 --> 17:15.134
Right.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.573
- No, you go.
- No, you go.

17:20.606 --> 17:22.075
No, you go.
Okay.

17:23.608 --> 17:25.877
It's just a beer run.
I'll go.

17:25.912 --> 17:28.115
Oh. Well, I can't
really drink beer,

17:28.146 --> 17:31.917
'cause, you know, barley,
but I'll go with you
to get some.

17:31.951 --> 17:34.253
Perfect. Here we go.
The beer-gettin'.

17:42.261 --> 17:44.631
This sucks.
I'm out.

17:44.663 --> 17:47.866
No way.
I think you're
doing fine.

17:47.900 --> 17:52.638
- You wanna try poker?
- I still say it's weird
without the kittens.

17:52.672 --> 17:55.107
No kittens.

17:55.142 --> 17:59.378
- He's quirky.
- Look, we've already been
playing for three hours.

17:59.412 --> 18:03.150
It's, like,
two-something
in the morning.

18:03.182 --> 18:07.386
- You can't bail now.
- Yeah. Come on, Buffy. Stay.
I wanna bankrupt somebody.

18:07.420 --> 18:10.056
Oh, we should totally
 have a slumber party.

18:10.088 --> 18:13.292
Oh, I don't know.

18:13.326 --> 18:16.563
I guess, as long as everyone's
staying up anyway.

18:16.596 --> 18:20.267
Must be some late-night
activities to keep us
busy till morning.

18:20.299 --> 18:23.236
How's that cramp, Spike?
Still bothering you?

18:23.269 --> 18:25.605
What? Oh. Yeah.

18:25.637 --> 18:27.973
Maybe you, uh, want to
put some ice on it.

18:33.346 --> 18:35.815
[ TV, Indistinct ]
 [ Laughing ]

18:37.683 --> 18:39.986
[ Cards Shuffling ]

18:45.224 --> 18:47.160
Hey, Xander, we gotta be
at work in a few minutes.

18:47.193 --> 18:49.862
Okay.

18:52.798 --> 18:56.502
- I can't be late today.
 - [ Spike ]
 You should definitely go.

18:56.536 --> 18:58.871
Let's find your coat
and get you on
your merry way.

18:58.904 --> 19:01.941
- Spike.
- I don't know why
I'm not leaving.

19:01.973 --> 19:04.443
Me, either.
Besides, Richie,

19:04.477 --> 19:07.314
you can't skip breakfast,
a growing boy like you.

19:07.346 --> 19:10.282
Me? I used to
love breakfast.

19:10.317 --> 19:13.185
In the old days,
I probably would
have eaten by now.

19:13.220 --> 19:15.121
Of course, with that
new diet of yours,
you wanna be careful...

19:15.153 --> 19:17.155
what you try putting
in your mouth now, Spikey.

19:17.190 --> 19:19.858
Yeah? I don't know.

19:19.892 --> 19:22.028
Tummy's making
all kinds of gurglies.

19:22.060 --> 19:26.465
Maybe I ought to just feed
 on whatever's around even if
 it doesn't go down well.

19:26.499 --> 19:29.736
You, uh, work out?
Okeydokey.

19:32.404 --> 19:34.340
Excuse us.

19:36.409 --> 19:39.578
Mr. Passive-Aggressive Guy,
you want to take it down
a notch or two in there?

19:39.612 --> 19:41.681
What? Poor, dainty Richard
can't take a joke?

19:41.713 --> 19:45.384
We do not joke
about eating people
in this house.

19:45.417 --> 19:47.753
What are you gonna do?
Beat me up again?

19:47.787 --> 19:49.922
I should have
thrown you out
the second you got here.

19:49.955 --> 19:52.392
I was insane to ever think
you could just hang out
with my friends.

19:52.424 --> 19:55.528
And I was insane
to think--

19:55.561 --> 19:59.766
No, wait.
You were right.
You're insane.

19:59.798 --> 20:02.368
[ Liquid Pouring ]
 [ Willow ]
 Oh. Hi.

20:02.402 --> 20:05.605
Hey.

20:05.637 --> 20:09.509
Breakfast. Didn't really plan
for a sleepover.

20:09.541 --> 20:12.511
No. Me either.

20:12.545 --> 20:16.082
It's weird. I--
I have class.
I know I should go.

20:16.115 --> 20:19.451
I know. It's like
I wanna leave,

20:19.486 --> 20:22.721
but I don't want to.
Exactly.

20:22.755 --> 20:26.125
I think it's time
for you to go.
Yeah. Well, can't. Daylight.

20:26.157 --> 20:27.859
Okay. I'll go.
I'll get the door.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.127
Fine.
Fine.

20:29.161 --> 20:32.365
I'm actually trying
to move now.
Me too.

20:32.398 --> 20:34.099
[ Sighs ]

20:35.734 --> 20:39.338
Well,
this can't be good.

20:45.010 --> 20:47.246
There's something
keeping us
in this house.

20:47.279 --> 20:50.549
Or someone.
Has everyone tried
to get out?

20:50.583 --> 20:53.085
What if we just, like,

20:53.118 --> 20:55.755
as a group, got upand threw
ourselves at the door?

20:55.788 --> 20:57.757
All right.
Count of three.

20:57.789 --> 21:02.628
One, two, three!

21:03.930 --> 21:06.499
Here we go.

21:08.601 --> 21:12.270
Hence the problem.
 [ Richard ]
 I really need to go.

21:12.305 --> 21:14.773
- I mean,
I have a job to get to.
- I have to open the Magic Box.

21:14.807 --> 21:18.310
I have a shift
at the Doublemeat.
Actually, I'm okay here.

21:18.345 --> 21:20.946
Yeah, I'm-I'm fine.

21:20.980 --> 21:23.316
Willow and Tara have class.
 I gotta be at the site.

21:23.349 --> 21:25.284
I know. We all have places
that we'd rather be.

21:25.317 --> 21:27.787
[ Spike ]
 Things we'd rather be doing.

21:27.819 --> 21:31.257
I think the first priority
has to be to find a way out.

21:31.289 --> 21:33.759
Sure. Of course you all
 want to leave.

21:33.792 --> 21:36.528
'Cause being stuck in here
with me, that would
really suck, right?

21:36.563 --> 21:40.333
No, Dawnie. It's just
 we have more important
 things to do.

21:40.366 --> 21:43.802
Yeah. I know. Important.
Whatever that means, right?

21:55.981 --> 21:57.616
Dawn?
What?

21:57.650 --> 22:01.153
Did you
do something?
Me?

22:01.186 --> 22:04.391
Do you know something?
'Cause we want you to feel
like you can tell us.

22:04.423 --> 22:06.992
- What would I know?
- Look, we're not
accusing you of anything.

22:07.026 --> 22:12.298
It's just you were
kind of taking it
personal down there.

22:12.330 --> 22:16.067
Oh, okay. So you've all
just decided that
somehow I'm responsible.

22:16.102 --> 22:19.171
Great. Here's me
basking in the love.

22:19.204 --> 22:22.409
No, it's just, you know,
you're upset 'cause
we all want to leave.

22:22.442 --> 22:24.510
Now we can't leave.
 Only thing missing
 is a cornfield.

22:24.544 --> 22:27.980
There-- There isn't
a cornfield, is there?

22:28.013 --> 22:30.416
Dawn, it's okay.
You know, we're
not gonna be mad.

22:30.450 --> 22:33.051
Yeah, only I didn't
do anything.

22:33.085 --> 22:35.822
- You sure?
- You want me to ask
my other self?

22:35.855 --> 22:38.691
- Dawn, we're just trying to
figure out what's going on.
- Figure it out yourself.

22:38.724 --> 22:40.527
I'm done being talked to
like a kid.

22:40.559 --> 22:43.695
Well, 'cause you know,
sometimes we do something...

22:43.730 --> 22:47.834
that seems like a good idea
at the time like, say, invoke
the power of a musical amulet.

22:47.866 --> 22:50.068
And it turns out,
you know, not so much.

22:50.102 --> 22:54.272
God! I didn't do
anything! I wish I had.

22:54.306 --> 22:56.542
I'm glad
 you're trapped.

22:56.576 --> 23:01.713
How else can I get anybody
to spend any time with me?

23:01.748 --> 23:04.884
Dawn, if you want us
to spend time with you--

23:04.916 --> 23:09.154
I don't. Get out.
Get out! Get out! Get out!

23:19.164 --> 23:22.801
- [ Anya ]
 I think she's possessed.
- She's a teenager.

23:22.835 --> 23:26.172
The phones are all out.
We're totally cut off.

23:28.106 --> 23:31.644
- She's just so angry.
- It happens.
We all went through it.

23:31.678 --> 23:36.115
I know. I just can't
figure out why
she didn't come to me.

23:36.147 --> 23:40.051
Well, you have been
 a little busy lately.

23:40.086 --> 23:42.922
Hey, I don't want to
 keep you all from
 the touchy-feelies,

23:42.954 --> 23:44.790
but maybe the encounter
group can meet later?

23:44.824 --> 23:47.326
Say, when we're not
trapped in a house.

23:47.358 --> 23:50.395
Even if Dawn does know
something, she's obviously
not gonna help us right now.

23:50.429 --> 23:52.898
We need another way.

23:52.932 --> 23:56.268
I think magic's
gonna be our best bet.
Something general, you know?

23:56.301 --> 23:58.938
Cast a wide net?

23:58.971 --> 24:01.907
- But, Willow.
- No. I'll do it.

24:01.941 --> 24:05.811
It's just-- obviously,
 I didn't bring any supplies.

24:05.845 --> 24:10.415
[ Buffy ] Well, we don't
 have any in the house.
 We got rid of everything.

24:10.449 --> 24:15.421
Actually...
not everything.

24:15.453 --> 24:20.026
I, uh, might have kept
one or two things, sort of.

24:21.693 --> 24:25.096
Just in case.

24:25.131 --> 24:27.666
That's great!

In a very bad way.

Just bring me what you have,
but then I'm doing this alone.

You need to
stay away from it.

24:58.329 --> 25:01.534
So we're supposed
to just wait?
It won't take long.

25:07.673 --> 25:11.376

want to tell me what's--
what's going on here?

25:11.410 --> 25:16.147

By what, some unseen
force or something?

she's doing in there.

 I don't think that's
 a skin condition.

That's the demon
 I killed two nights ago.

 you killed.

Oh, God.
Let's get him upstairs.

26:48.807 --> 26:51.743
We need to get him
to a doctor soon.

Hey, it's gonna be okay.
 Just trust me.

out of here soon.

26:57.884 --> 27:03.021
Oh, God.
Oh, God.

27:03.055 --> 27:06.424
Okay, so maybe "soon" was
 a bit of an overstatement.

27:06.458 --> 27:09.461
So, you ever think
about not celebrating
a birthday?

27:09.494 --> 27:12.631
Just to try it, I mean?
I'm gonna go
check upstairs.

27:12.664 --> 27:15.300

down here.

31:18.243 --> 31:22.280
Nothing.
Dawn, come on.

31:22.314 --> 31:26.018
No.
You don't know.

31:26.051 --> 31:29.855
You have this thing you do.
You have all these friends.

31:29.887 --> 31:31.958
You have no idea
what it's like.

31:31.990 --> 31:35.027
What are you talking about?
I don't know what, what?

31:35.060 --> 31:37.963
Being alone.

31:37.997 --> 31:40.766
You're not alone.

31:40.798 --> 31:44.971
Then why
do I feel like this?

31:45.003 --> 31:47.806
I just think we haven't
thought of the right way
out yet-- that's all.

31:47.838 --> 31:49.607
[ Spike ]
 We can't stay put
 like cattle,

31:49.641 --> 31:53.112
waiting for that thing
to pop out every time
it gets peckish.

31:53.144 --> 31:55.948
I'd say we do another spell,
but I think
we've tried everything.

31:58.017 --> 32:00.751
That's not
completely true, is it?

32:00.786 --> 32:05.590
I mean, not everything.
Not exactly.

32:05.624 --> 32:09.461
We're sitting here with
 an incredibly powerful witch.

32:09.494 --> 32:11.998
Much more powerful
than you, Tara, I'm sorry.

32:12.030 --> 32:14.465
Only no one seems
willing to say it.

32:14.500 --> 32:19.305
- I can't.
- No. See, that's not
exactly true, either.

32:19.337 --> 32:23.509
Not can't. Won't.

32:23.541 --> 32:27.145
You don't know
how much I hate this.

32:27.179 --> 32:29.914
I don't know if there's
even anything I could do.

32:29.948 --> 32:34.519
Yes, and a good way to find
out is to sit around
and try nothing.

32:34.552 --> 32:37.288
That was sarcasm,
by the way.

32:37.323 --> 32:38.624
Look--
It's dangerous.

32:38.656 --> 32:42.461
And so is all of us dying.

32:42.493 --> 32:46.698
Wil, look, I don't want to
gang up on you, but Anya
kind of has a point.

32:46.731 --> 32:48.967
We brought you back
 from it once.

32:49.000 --> 32:51.269
We're all here.
It's just one little spell.

32:51.302 --> 32:54.472
- Whatever happens, we can
 bring you back again.
- No. I can't.

32:54.506 --> 32:58.277
If I start, I might not
 be able to stop.

32:58.309 --> 33:00.878
And whose fault is that?

33:00.912 --> 33:04.016
If you hadn't gotten so much
of this in your system
in the first place--

33:04.049 --> 33:08.287
Hey! You're gonna back off.
She said no, and that's it.

33:08.319 --> 33:12.191
You're not gonna make her
do something that she doesn't
want to, and if you try,

33:12.223 --> 33:15.560
you're gonna have to
go through me first.

33:15.594 --> 33:18.130
Understood?

33:18.163 --> 33:21.166
Fine.

33:21.200 --> 33:24.369
If you all aren't willing
to get us out of this,
then I will do it myself.

33:30.541 --> 33:33.878
I wish you would've
told me.

33:33.912 --> 33:35.681
You haven't really been--

33:38.784 --> 33:42.921
What?
I haven't been what?
Around.

33:45.090 --> 33:50.429
Dawn, the most important
job that I have
is looking out for you.

33:50.461 --> 33:54.566
You sound like
my guidance counselor.

33:54.599 --> 33:56.734
Did she give you
a handbook or something?

33:56.768 --> 33:58.369
"Talkin' To the Troubled Teen"?

33:58.403 --> 34:02.607
Counselor?
It wasn't my idea.

34:02.641 --> 34:05.042
I didn't even know
we had guidance counselors.

34:05.076 --> 34:07.278
She called me out of class
like I was a total J.D.

34:07.313 --> 34:10.715
And you'd never
met her before?

34:10.748 --> 34:14.052
No. Not until yesterday.

34:14.085 --> 34:19.056
And she got you to start
talking about things
that bothered you at home?

34:19.090 --> 34:22.594
Uh, yeah.

34:23.994 --> 34:29.067
You didn't,
by any chance,
happen to express,

34:29.101 --> 34:32.902
like, a wish,
or something to her?

34:32.938 --> 34:36.074
Um, maybe just a little.

34:36.108 --> 34:38.277
[ Clattering ]

34:38.309 --> 34:41.213
Honey. Hey, honey.
 Come on. This isn't the way.
 Calm down.

34:41.246 --> 34:44.215
She knows something.

34:44.250 --> 34:45.951
She knows something.
We have to find out
what it is.

34:45.983 --> 34:48.585
Hey!

34:48.619 --> 34:50.722
An, just stop
 for a second.

34:50.755 --> 34:53.458
- There's gotta be a clue
in here somewhere.
- Stop it.

34:53.492 --> 34:55.893
- [ Buffy ]
 Anya, it wasn't her fault.
- Where is it?

34:55.927 --> 34:57.963
No.

35:06.137 --> 35:07.972
[ Anya ]
 Half this stuff
 is from the Magic Box.

35:17.648 --> 35:19.617
How could you do this?

35:31.862 --> 35:35.434
I work hard at that store,
and I helped you.

35:35.467 --> 35:39.103
I took care of you.
This is how you say thank you?

35:39.137 --> 35:41.840
Anya, hold on, okay?
Tell her you didn't do this.

35:41.873 --> 35:43.641
Tell her it's a mistake.

35:47.012 --> 35:49.315
No.

35:52.318 --> 35:56.855
- Oh.
- Buffy.

35:56.887 --> 36:00.958
How are we supposed to
trust you, Dawn?

36:00.992 --> 36:04.362
I mean, you-- you say
you didn't put us here,
but look at this stuff.

36:04.396 --> 36:06.664
How are we supposed
 to believe you?

36:06.697 --> 36:08.666
Look, I don't think
 it's all her fault, okay?

36:08.699 --> 36:11.902
She-- There was
someone pretending to be
a guidance counselor.

36:11.936 --> 36:14.539
She made Dawn
make a wish.

36:14.572 --> 36:18.909
Guidance counselor?
You made a wish to someone
you've never seen before?

36:18.943 --> 36:20.811
Yeah.

36:20.846 --> 36:25.351
Did she wear a pendant
with a dark blue stone?

36:25.384 --> 36:27.853
And little red flecks?

36:27.885 --> 36:31.322
For cryin' out loud.
Halfrek!

36:31.356 --> 36:33.592
It's Halfrek,
a vengeance demon.

36:33.625 --> 36:37.161
- You made a wish to
a vengeance demon.
- I didn't know.

36:37.195 --> 36:39.597
Only a vengeance demon
can break her own
vengeance spell.

36:39.630 --> 36:43.034
Nothing else will work.
She's the only one
who can get us out of here.

36:43.068 --> 36:46.838
Hallie, get your ass
down here!
You rang?

36:46.871 --> 36:49.240
[ Gasps ]

37:00.050 --> 37:03.454
I hope you die,
you stupid jerkface!

37:12.931 --> 37:14.800
Anya!

37:22.407 --> 37:24.476
The sword!

37:40.458 --> 37:42.360
Her pendant.
 Get her pendant.

37:47.766 --> 37:50.501
There will be no touching
of the pendant.

37:59.177 --> 38:01.847
What?
[Laughs]

38:01.880 --> 38:05.351
Did you think I'd be stopped
by a sword in the chest?
Flesh wound.

38:05.384 --> 38:08.853
Honestly, Anyanka,
you used to know better.

38:10.856 --> 38:16.027
How could you?
Why would you do this?

38:16.061 --> 38:19.530
I told you I was going to
take care of some business
while I was here in town.

38:19.565 --> 38:23.101
Yeah, but cursing us?
Some of them are
in the wedding party.

38:23.134 --> 38:25.670
I just go where I'm--

38:25.704 --> 38:28.840
William?

38:28.873 --> 38:31.510
Hey, wait a minute.

38:31.543 --> 38:33.878
You guys know each other?

38:36.347 --> 38:39.851
Uh, no.
[ Laughs ]
No.

38:39.885 --> 38:42.387
Not really.
 I thought vengeance demons...

38:42.420 --> 38:44.489
only punished men
who wronged women.

38:44.523 --> 38:47.726
Oh, that was Anya's
little raison d'être.

38:47.759 --> 38:49.994
Most of us try to be
a little more well-rounded,

38:50.027 --> 38:51.996
and actually,
we prefer "justice demon."

38:52.030 --> 38:54.298
Okay? F.Y.I.

38:54.331 --> 38:57.969
Well-rounded, huh?
Is that how you explain
your thing for bad parents?

38:58.003 --> 39:00.371
It's not a thing.
The children need me.

39:00.405 --> 39:03.875
Hmph.
[ Coughing ]
Daddy issues.

39:03.909 --> 39:08.579
Sling all the little barbs
at me that you want, Anyanka.

39:08.614 --> 39:13.251
It doesn't change the fact
that this girl was in pain,
and none of you could hear it.

39:13.284 --> 39:16.320
I could hear her crying out
everywhere I went in this town.

39:16.353 --> 39:21.192
It was unbearable,
and none of you knew.

39:23.293 --> 39:27.398
You people deserve
to be cursed.
Enjoy your time together.

39:27.432 --> 39:30.835
From now on,
all you have is time.

39:30.869 --> 39:34.072
Time and each other.

39:35.541 --> 39:37.141
Good luck.

39:46.652 --> 39:48.820
Wait. Wait.

39:50.221 --> 39:52.824
Time and each other.
[ Clears Throat ]

39:58.063 --> 40:02.000
[ Sighs ]
It's the curse, Hallie.

40:03.668 --> 40:06.103
For crying out loud.

40:06.137 --> 40:09.574
Fine, the curse is lifted.
We can all leave now.

40:09.608 --> 40:11.510
Damn it.

40:18.148 --> 40:21.418
Thanks for before,

40:21.452 --> 40:24.155
and for taking
this stuff with you.

40:26.023 --> 40:28.927
No problem.

40:28.960 --> 40:33.231
Just so you know,
I was never gonna use it.

40:33.264 --> 40:38.670
I mean, not really.
I just kept it
like a safety net.

40:38.704 --> 40:42.106
'Cause there was always...

40:42.139 --> 40:45.143
this thing in
the back of my head.

40:45.175 --> 40:48.579
This, you know, voice,
saying, like,

40:48.614 --> 40:51.617
"What if things get bad,
really bad,

40:51.650 --> 40:55.987
and what if you
can't handle it?"

40:56.021 --> 41:00.358
And it made me panic,
so that's why I kept
a couple of things.

41:03.829 --> 41:06.463
I kept them, so I didn't
have to think about it,

41:06.498 --> 41:09.534
so I could focus on
getting better.

41:12.503 --> 41:16.440
I get it.
I really do,

41:16.474 --> 41:19.277
but it's time to work
without the net, Wil.

41:19.309 --> 41:22.280
You know, I don't know
if you noticed,

41:22.313 --> 41:24.148
but it actually did
get bad in there.

41:24.181 --> 41:29.186
Really bad,
and you still said no.

41:36.393 --> 41:38.597
[ Groaning ]
Ow.

41:43.001 --> 41:45.469
You have some
weird friends.

41:45.503 --> 41:47.472
News from the file
marked "Duh."

41:47.505 --> 41:49.541
We're gonna get
him to the E.R.

41:49.574 --> 41:52.376
And then we're gonna talk
 about payment, and, Dawnie,
 there are two words...

41:52.409 --> 41:55.280
I want you to get used to:
punitive damages.

41:56.882 --> 42:00.952
Think it's worn off?
Just one thing to do.

42:16.568 --> 42:19.103
Okay. Who's pushing?

42:19.137 --> 42:22.106
- Oh, look at the stars.
- Good party.

[ Xander ]
 I just wanna run barefoot
 on the grass...

42:24.474 --> 42:27.813

 between my--
 God, look at the stars!
