WEBVTT

00:04.372 --> 00:06.774
- Your tea's ready, babe.
- Aww!

00:06.807 --> 00:10.144
- I can't thank
your aunt enough

00:10.178 --> 00:11.379
for taking care of Jenna.

00:11.412 --> 00:13.181
I now am left
with some free time

00:13.214 --> 00:15.183
to look after my lady.

00:15.216 --> 00:16.617
- Aww, loving that.

00:16.650 --> 00:20.020
But are you sure
I'm not distracting you?

00:20.054 --> 00:21.722
You look like you got
a lot going on.

00:21.755 --> 00:25.726
- Well, I thought that
when I left the force

00:25.759 --> 00:28.862
that I would dig into
Kristen Kramer's background.

00:28.896 --> 00:32.266
You know, see what she wants
with this city's metas

00:32.300 --> 00:35.002
since she's replaced me
as captain.

00:35.035 --> 00:39.107
And look, everything I've
dug up so far looks like this.

00:39.140 --> 00:43.344
- Hmm, I actually
have something for you.

00:43.377 --> 00:45.313
So one of my pro bono clients

00:45.346 --> 00:47.548
is a meta who's
also an army vet.

00:47.581 --> 00:49.083
I was prepping
for his deposition,

00:49.117 --> 00:50.418
and I came across a name

00:50.451 --> 00:52.520
I think you might
find interesting.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.054
- Kristen Kramer?
- Yep.

00:56.857 --> 00:59.260
- This says they served
together at Fort Dakota,

00:59.293 --> 01:02.263
but her DOD doesn't say that.

01:02.296 --> 01:03.497
- Maybe it's an oversight?

01:03.531 --> 01:04.698
- Or it could be

01:04.732 --> 01:05.966
that she doesn't
want anybody to know

01:05.999 --> 01:07.668
that she served there.

01:07.701 --> 01:11.272
If these files are still
around, they're here.

01:11.305 --> 01:13.507
I'll be back
in a couple of hours.

01:13.541 --> 01:15.376
- Good luck.

01:21.615 --> 01:26.620

01:38.999 --> 01:41.369

01:50.478 --> 01:53.614
Somebody help me!

02:12.132 --> 02:15.569
- Wow! This is new.

02:15.603 --> 02:16.737
- Uh, frak.

02:16.770 --> 02:18.539
Was I supposed to ask

02:18.572 --> 02:20.541
before I changed everything?

02:20.574 --> 02:23.110
'Cause, look, I kept
the pinball machine.

02:23.143 --> 02:25.613
- Oh, and Frost
is gonna love that.

02:25.646 --> 02:29.082
It's just I've never seen
this room

02:29.116 --> 02:30.784
without all of Cisco's stuff
in it.

02:30.818 --> 02:34.455
- Which I totally understand.

02:34.488 --> 02:35.456
I'll tell you what.

02:35.489 --> 02:36.890
It ain't no thang.

02:36.924 --> 02:38.892
I can take all my junk
back to my garage.

02:38.926 --> 02:40.261
I can bring everything--
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

02:40.294 --> 02:41.595
Slow down, Chester, okay?

02:41.629 --> 02:42.896
I just said it's different.

02:42.930 --> 02:44.732
That's not necessarily
a bad thing.

02:44.765 --> 02:47.801
And look, S.T.A.R. Labs
is your lab,

02:47.835 --> 02:50.003
and we want you
to feel at home here too.

02:51.239 --> 02:53.474
Thank you for saying that...

02:53.507 --> 02:55.776
'cause it took
a very long time

02:55.809 --> 02:58.512

03:15.128 --> 03:17.064
- No worries,
I will teach you the basics,

03:17.097 --> 03:21.935
which, I might add,
I learned from building robots.

03:21.969 --> 03:23.003
- Amazing.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.638
- You know
what I think we need?

03:24.672 --> 03:27.475
I think we need
some more bass up in here!

Oh!

03:49.897 --> 03:53.401
Uh...not to worry.

03:53.434 --> 03:55.436
We have a replacement cable
just like this one

03:55.469 --> 03:56.637
in the Starchives.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.472
Aisle B, Shelf 52.

03:58.506 --> 04:01.975
- Wow, you're inventorying
the Starchives as well.

04:02.009 --> 04:04.778
Cisco really did leave us
in good hands.

04:04.812 --> 04:06.947
- Well, I learned
from the best.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.782
Now, don't go anywhere,

04:08.816 --> 04:09.983

Your hair.
And your shirt's inside out.

05:21.389 --> 05:23.256
- Um, I have that call.

05:23.290 --> 05:24.825
I was telling you
about the work call...

05:24.858 --> 05:25.826
- You were.
- I was telling you about?

05:25.859 --> 05:27.094
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.

05:27.127 --> 05:28.396
- So I'm gonna go do that,

05:28.429 --> 05:29.463
You boys have fun.

05:38.572 --> 05:41.074
- Sorry about this.

05:41.108 --> 05:42.976
You know, after everything
that happened with the Forces,

05:43.010 --> 05:45.312
Iris and I,
we've decided to start trying--

05:45.345 --> 05:47.280
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
No, no. Cool. Cool.

05:47.314 --> 05:48.816
Nice, bro. No, it's cool. Cool.
- Yeah. Well--

05:48.849 --> 05:50.250
- I don't need to know.
- Okay.

05:50.283 --> 05:51.952

- All right. Cool.

- We good, man. Yeah.
I don't need to know. I'm good.

05:53.320 --> 05:54.622
- Yeah.
Actually, that's the Cecile.

05:54.655 --> 05:56.056
She needs help with the case...

05:56.089 --> 05:57.458
- Cool. Cool, cool.
- So I should go. Bye.

05:57.491 --> 06:00.861
<i>*</i>

06:00.894 --> 06:03.330
- Cisco, you did not warn me
about this.

06:03.363 --> 06:07.100
<i>*</i>

06:07.134 --> 06:10.037
- So what do you think?
Does my client have a case?

06:10.070 --> 06:12.506
- I mean, as you know,
the State says

06:12.540 --> 06:14.074
your meta client Erik Frye

06:14.107 --> 06:17.244
used his pyrokinetic powers
to burn the building,

06:17.277 --> 06:19.780
but CSIs found butane
at the scene.

06:19.813 --> 06:22.716
So obviously,
seems more like human arson.

06:22.750 --> 06:24.885
- Mm, sounds
like reasonable doubt to me.

06:24.918 --> 06:25.919
Great work, Barr.

06:25.953 --> 06:28.989
- Yeah, and this case,

06:29.022 --> 06:32.159
does it feel familiar to you?

06:32.192 --> 06:35.262
Didn't you defend someone
like this a few years ago?

06:37.164 --> 06:39.232
Whoa.
- Hey, are you okay?

06:39.266 --> 06:42.536
- I don't know.
I feel numb all of a sudden.

06:42.570 --> 06:45.539
<i>*</i>

06:45.573 --> 06:47.007
- What's the matter, Barry?

06:47.040 --> 06:49.342
Getting ill?

06:49.376 --> 06:50.811
- I can't see.

06:50.844 --> 06:53.080
Cecile, what are you
doing to me?

06:53.113 --> 06:54.615
- Getting you out of the way.

06:54.648 --> 06:56.416
I have a plan, Barry Allen,

06:56.450 --> 06:58.852
and you need to be gone
for it to work.

06:58.886 --> 07:03.290
Oh, one more thing.
Ugh, I'm not Cecile.

07:03.323 --> 07:08.829
Your mind belongs to me now,
so just let go.

07:11.865 --> 07:15.769
<i>*</i>

07:15.803 --> 07:17.805
- What the hell?

07:18.606 --> 07:21.274
- Barry?

07:22.409 --> 07:24.512
Is it really you?

07:24.545 --> 07:26.914
<i>*</i>

07:31.852 --> 07:33.086
- I don't know what happened.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.254
One second he was helping me
with a case,

07:34.287 --> 07:36.323
and the next,
he just passed out.

07:36.356 --> 07:38.091
- Barry's brainwaves
are oscillating

07:38.125 --> 07:40.994
at 0.5 hertz, which
is typical of a coma patient.

07:41.028 --> 07:42.730
Look what the EEG picked up.

07:42.763 --> 07:46.500
It appears to be some sort of
psychic neurofeedback signal.

07:46.534 --> 07:49.402
I think that's what's causing
this brain activity.

07:49.436 --> 07:50.904
But I've never seen
anything like it.

07:50.938 --> 07:53.373
If Barry's brain activity
stays like this,

07:53.406 --> 07:55.509
he could be comatose
for the rest of his life.

07:57.711 --> 07:59.747
We need to figure out
who did this and fast.

07:59.780 --> 08:02.449
- Okay. And how do we do that?

08:02.482 --> 08:07.521
- Well, this may
be a long shot, but...

08:08.656 --> 08:10.624
- What? Me?

08:10.658 --> 08:11.792
<i>*</i>

08:11.825 --> 08:13.561
Oh.

08:13.594 --> 08:15.963
Yeah, I would love to try,

08:15.996 --> 08:19.399
but guys, I'm just an empath.

08:19.432 --> 08:21.201
- Cecile, if you use
your powers

08:21.234 --> 08:23.403
on Barry's brain,
you'll be able to sense

08:23.436 --> 08:25.205
if there's someone else's
emotions

08:25.238 --> 08:26.774
that are active
within his mind.

08:26.807 --> 08:28.676
- Chester's right.
It could work.

08:28.709 --> 08:30.544
<i>*</i>

08:30.578 --> 08:33.914
- Okay. I'll give it a shot.

08:33.947 --> 08:36.684
<i>*</i>

08:40.053 --> 08:44.291
Barry's emotions,
I can't sense them.

08:44.324 --> 08:47.394
But I can feel something else.

08:47.427 --> 08:50.030
Something...cold.

08:50.063 --> 08:52.499
Like madness.

08:52.532 --> 08:54.067
I can see something now.
I can see something.

08:54.101 --> 08:57.705
It's--it's like a light
in the middle

08:57.738 --> 08:59.339
of all of that darkness.

08:59.372 --> 09:00.908
It's shining.

09:00.941 --> 09:03.677
Glowing gold?

09:03.711 --> 09:07.681
Like a golden mask?

09:07.715 --> 09:10.483
- Sweet Ira Cooper.

09:10.517 --> 09:14.387
Folks, I think I know
who did this.

09:14.421 --> 09:16.690
<i>*</i>

09:16.724 --> 09:19.993
So, Cecile,
the mask that you saw,

09:20.027 --> 09:22.562
did it look like this?

09:22.596 --> 09:27.267
<i>*</i>

09:27.300 --> 09:28.936
- Mm-hmm.

09:28.969 --> 09:30.804
- Psycho Pirate. I knew it.

09:30.838 --> 09:32.572
- Roger Hayden?

09:32.606 --> 09:35.575
He was a patient
at Arkham Asylum who we fought.

09:35.609 --> 09:37.310
He claimed
that he got psychic powers

09:37.344 --> 09:39.479
from a mask he stole
from the Khandaqi Embassy.

09:39.512 --> 09:43.250
But no one believed him because
he was certifiably insane.

09:43.283 --> 09:44.517
- But I-I don't get it.

09:44.551 --> 09:45.786
Why would Hayden
go after the Flash?

09:45.819 --> 09:46.987
- He didn't.

09:47.020 --> 09:49.056
He's at Arkham,
but the mask isn't.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.058
It says here
that after the breakout,

09:51.091 --> 09:52.693
Arkham returned the mask
to the embassy

09:52.726 --> 09:55.295
but then they donated it
to the Central City Museum.

09:55.328 --> 09:59.166
It's going on display tomorrow
as a part of an exhibition.

09:59.199 --> 10:00.567
- Okay, they have no idea

10:00.600 --> 10:02.602
just how dangerous
this thing really is.

10:02.636 --> 10:04.938
<i>*</i>

10:04.972 --> 10:06.606
According to legends,

10:06.640 --> 10:09.009
the warrior Gilgamesh
used a gold mask

10:09.042 --> 10:12.479
to imprison a powerful demon,
or what we might consider today

10:12.512 --> 10:14.547
as an ancient psychic
meta-human.

10:14.581 --> 10:16.817
But with the centuries,
the mask has popped up

10:16.850 --> 10:20.253
the Yoruba Tribe in Africa,

10:20.287 --> 10:24.224
17th-century pirates,
all the way up to Hayden.

10:24.257 --> 10:27.127
Now, the story goes,
if you wear the mask,

10:27.160 --> 10:29.396
it doesn't just
give you powers.

10:29.429 --> 10:31.564
It feeds off of your mind,

10:31.598 --> 10:34.301
leaving you insane
and leaving the mask

10:34.334 --> 10:36.103
in search of a new wearer.

10:36.136 --> 10:38.638
- A psychic parasite
moving from host to host,

10:38.672 --> 10:41.274
and now it found a brain that's
capable of speed thinking.

10:41.308 --> 10:44.044
- So it's the mask
that's attacking Barry.

10:44.077 --> 10:45.612
- But Barry's not
wearing the mask.

10:45.645 --> 10:48.315
- No. The neurofeedback signal
must be the mask

10:48.348 --> 10:49.950
trying to start feeding.

10:49.983 --> 10:51.284
And now that
it's touched something,

10:51.318 --> 10:52.619
it'll just keep feeding
and feeding

10:52.652 --> 10:54.121
until it gets rid
of all the brainwaves.

10:54.154 --> 10:55.789
- What about
the cerebral inhibitor

10:55.823 --> 10:57.691
that you guys used on DeVoe?
- That would stop the signal

10:57.725 --> 11:00.060
and get Barry's brain
functioning again.

11:00.093 --> 11:02.662
But we need the mask here
to do that.

11:02.696 --> 11:05.465
<i>*</i>

11:07.167 --> 11:10.070
It's too bad you can't just
grab the mask

11:10.103 --> 11:11.671
from the museum, huh?

11:11.705 --> 11:15.175
<i>*</i>

11:15.208 --> 11:17.778
- Why can't we?

11:17.811 --> 11:20.981
<i>*</i>

11:21.014 --> 11:24.517
- Cecile?
-

11:24.551 --> 11:26.353
- Are you okay?

11:26.386 --> 11:29.122
- I don't know. I don't know.

11:29.156 --> 11:31.391
I'm so happy to see you.

11:31.424 --> 11:33.193
- It's okay.

11:33.226 --> 11:37.164
I'm gonna get you out of here,
wherever here is.

11:37.197 --> 11:38.999
Do you have any idea
where we are?

11:39.032 --> 11:42.602
<i>*</i>

11:42.635 --> 11:46.974
- The last thing I remember,
I was--I was at home with Joe

11:47.007 --> 11:48.776
and there was a storm.

11:53.881 --> 11:56.049
<i>*</i>

11:56.083 --> 11:57.417
<i>And then I woke up...</i>

11:58.585 --> 12:00.287
<i>And I was locked in this room.</i>

12:00.320 --> 12:03.456
<i>*</i>

12:03.490 --> 12:06.593
- Cecile, the Force Storm
was two weeks ago.

12:06.626 --> 12:07.961
- What?

12:07.995 --> 12:08.996
- Have you've been in here

12:09.029 --> 12:10.798
this whole time all alone?

12:10.831 --> 12:15.102
- Barry, I don't think there's
any way out of this place.

12:15.135 --> 12:16.804
- Then we have to make one.

12:16.837 --> 12:20.207
<i>*</i>

12:20.240 --> 12:23.276
Before I got here,
I thought I was talking to you.

12:23.310 --> 12:26.947
I think whoever trapped us here
took over your body.

12:26.980 --> 12:29.216
- Who could do something
like that?

12:29.249 --> 12:32.285
- I'm not sure. I don't know.

12:32.319 --> 12:34.121
Bashir, maybe.

12:34.154 --> 12:36.423
But Bashir is on our side now.

12:36.456 --> 12:38.892
So I don't think this was him.

12:41.929 --> 12:48.268
<i>*</i>

12:48.301 --> 12:49.702
I don't have my powers.

12:49.736 --> 12:53.640
<i>*</i>

12:53.673 --> 12:55.342
When I was in Grodd's mind,
he trapped me

12:55.375 --> 12:58.511
in one of his old cages.

12:58.545 --> 13:03.583
If this--if this
is a mindscape, like that was,

13:03.616 --> 13:06.786
maybe this asylum is a memory.

13:06.820 --> 13:09.356
But whose memory is it?

13:09.389 --> 13:12.492
And why trap is here now?

13:17.297 --> 13:18.765
Has that ever happened?

13:18.798 --> 13:19.933
<i>*</i>

13:19.967 --> 13:21.969
- No.

13:22.002 --> 13:23.270
<i>*</i>

13:23.303 --> 13:24.771
- Okay. All right.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.506
We have to see if there's
a way out of this place.

13:26.539 --> 13:30.077
- Wait. Barry, wait.
Your powers aren't working.

13:30.110 --> 13:31.478
What if it's not safe
out there?

13:31.511 --> 13:32.946
What if--what if--
what if it's not safe

13:32.980 --> 13:37.184
and--what happens if we die
in a mindscape?

13:37.217 --> 13:39.352
- Then we die in real life too.

13:39.386 --> 13:42.222
But we're not the only ones
in danger here.

13:42.255 --> 13:43.523
Whoever took over your body

13:43.556 --> 13:45.592
could hurt Joe or Iris.
All right. Look.

13:45.625 --> 13:49.229
If there's any chance we can
escape, we have to take it.

13:52.265 --> 13:57.270
<i>*</i>

14:06.313 --> 14:07.780
- Barry's still losing
brain activity.

14:07.814 --> 14:09.482
How long till we get
our hands on that mask?

14:09.516 --> 14:12.019
- Okay. So heists aren't really
my expertise,

14:12.052 --> 14:14.087
but Cisco did leave me

14:14.121 --> 14:16.789
a number to call
in case of an emergency.

14:16.823 --> 14:18.425
- It's a good thing too.

14:20.427 --> 14:22.762
'Cause this one sounds
like a doozy.

14:22.795 --> 14:28.668
<i>*</i>

14:33.907 --> 14:35.442
- So the mask
goes on display tomorrow.

14:35.475 --> 14:37.410
But for tonight,
it's on lockdown

14:37.444 --> 14:39.079
in Central City Museums'

14:39.112 --> 14:41.681
state-of-the-art
restoration lab.

14:41.714 --> 14:43.483
Hermetically sealed
and protected

14:43.516 --> 14:44.985
by a laser security grid system

14:45.018 --> 14:48.688
that's sensitive enough
to detect a dust mite.

14:48.721 --> 14:51.524
Which is nothing
I can't handle.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.026
There is one snag, though.

14:53.060 --> 14:54.962
the museum just installed

14:54.995 --> 14:58.231
a bleeding-edge
Montgomery 5000 vault.

14:58.265 --> 15:00.267
It has a passcode
that changes every day.

15:00.300 --> 15:04.304
The only person that knows that
code is the security guard.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.206
- Hold up.

15:06.239 --> 15:07.840
Cecile.
- Huh?

15:07.874 --> 15:11.044
- You could put some kind
of empathic whammy on him.

15:11.078 --> 15:12.379
You know, like getting

15:12.412 --> 15:14.047
to the guard's noggin'
with your powers?

15:14.081 --> 15:16.783
- I'm not a mind reader,
Chester.

15:16.816 --> 15:17.917
Okay.

15:17.951 --> 15:21.921
But--but maybe

15:21.955 --> 15:24.391
if I get close enough
to the guard,

15:24.424 --> 15:28.461
I could try transferring
my emotions into him,

15:28.495 --> 15:30.030
making him anxious enough

15:30.063 --> 15:34.167
to want to open
the vault door for us?

15:34.201 --> 15:36.369
But no.
No, it's way too risky.

15:36.403 --> 15:39.706
Look, I am a lawyer.
I am not a cat burglar.

15:39.739 --> 15:41.341
There's no way
I can pull that off.

15:41.374 --> 15:44.978
- Uh, yes, you can.
I know you, Cecile.

15:45.012 --> 15:47.614
You're just as brave and
as capable as the rest of us.

15:47.647 --> 15:49.249
Look, all you need to do
is follow Sue in

15:49.282 --> 15:51.184
after you disable
the lasers, right?

15:51.218 --> 15:52.986
- Mm-hmm.

15:55.788 --> 15:57.124
Joe is never
gonna believe this.

15:58.925 --> 16:00.093
- Okay, then.

16:00.127 --> 16:02.529
- I am definitely gonna need
a better outfit

16:02.562 --> 16:04.364
for breaking and entering.

16:07.400 --> 16:10.703
<i>*</i>

16:10.737 --> 16:12.239
- Feeling
pretty confident, huh?

16:12.272 --> 16:14.707
- Oh, I am now.
You planned that heist so fast,

16:14.741 --> 16:16.276
you made Dom Toretto
in "Fast Five"

16:16.309 --> 16:18.311
look like Dom Toretto
in "Fast One."

16:18.345 --> 16:20.980
- About that.

16:21.014 --> 16:22.649
Is there anything
about this whole situation

16:22.682 --> 16:28.288
that seems kind of,
I don't know, odd to you?

16:28.321 --> 16:30.457
I mean, we ID'd our target
an hour ago,

16:30.490 --> 16:32.859
and we've done zero recon.

16:32.892 --> 16:34.361
It's heist 101.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.329
- You think
it's almost too easy.

16:36.363 --> 16:38.065
Okay. Look.

16:38.098 --> 16:40.633
Ever since I got here,
I've been training my butt off

16:40.667 --> 16:42.869
for craziness
exactly like this.

16:42.902 --> 16:45.638
So I-I've done my homework,
I've checked the math.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.340
Heck, this isn't even
the first time

16:47.374 --> 16:49.676
I've helped save Barry's brain.

16:49.709 --> 16:52.112
Team Flash
just makes it look easy.

16:52.145 --> 16:53.946
We got this.

16:53.980 --> 16:55.548
- If you say so.

16:55.582 --> 17:01.388
<i>*</i>

17:01.421 --> 17:05.192
- Yeah, no, we--we got this.

17:05.225 --> 17:08.161
Yeah. Yeah, we got this.

17:08.195 --> 17:13.233
<i>*</i>

17:13.266 --> 17:15.835
- Okay, it looks like security
just switched shifts.

17:15.868 --> 17:19.206
- Ilsa Faust,
you are good to go.

17:19.239 --> 17:24.244
<i>*</i>

17:31.184 --> 17:33.186
I'm in.

17:33.220 --> 17:34.687
<i>- How's it looking?</i>

17:34.721 --> 17:36.489
- Well, I'll know in a second.

17:36.523 --> 17:41.528
<i>*</i>

17:49.602 --> 17:52.004
<i>- Whoa, those
are some serious lasers.</i>

17:52.038 --> 17:53.306
- Oh, this is nothing.

17:53.340 --> 17:56.042
You should see what Ralph and I
faced in Tunisia.

18:00.913 --> 18:05.918
<i>*</i>

18:38.685 --> 18:39.752
Lasers are clear.

18:39.786 --> 18:41.988
- You learned that in Tunisia?

18:42.021 --> 18:44.724
- No.
DeMatteis Academy of Dance.

18:45.725 --> 18:46.726
She's good to go.

18:46.759 --> 18:49.462
- Ahh. Ah! Okay. Oh.

18:54.801 --> 18:58.805
I remember why
I hate rock climbing.

18:58.838 --> 19:00.907
- You're doing great.

19:00.940 --> 19:02.609
Let's find that security guard
and get in there.

19:05.645 --> 19:08.715
<i>*</i>

19:11.751 --> 19:16.756
<i>*</i>

19:20.660 --> 19:23.830
- All these doors are locked.

19:23.863 --> 19:25.332
I think we should
try another floor.

19:25.365 --> 19:28.935
- No.
It's a one-story building.

19:28.968 --> 19:30.637
I think that we should
just double back.

19:30.670 --> 19:35.475
<i>*</i>

19:35.508 --> 19:38.311
- What was that?
- Barry, don't.

19:38.345 --> 19:41.748
- It's okay. Come on.

19:41.781 --> 19:48.755
<i>*</i>

19:48.788 --> 19:50.490
- What is that?

19:50.523 --> 19:52.592
<i>*</i>

19:52.625 --> 19:54.961
- That's our way out.

19:54.994 --> 19:57.364
I've seen portals
like this before.

19:57.397 --> 19:59.532
We go through there,
we're home free.

20:05.338 --> 20:06.606
What the hell?

20:06.639 --> 20:08.508
- Barry, we gotta go.

20:08.541 --> 20:10.209
- Hold on a sec.

20:10.243 --> 20:13.179
Hello?

20:13.212 --> 20:15.315
Are you okay?

20:16.716 --> 20:19.018
- Please, forget her.
We gotta get out of here.

20:19.051 --> 20:22.689
- Somethings not right.
Who are you?

20:22.722 --> 20:24.624
Are you trapped here too?

20:24.657 --> 20:26.192
- Barry, let's go!

20:26.225 --> 20:30.463
- Hey, we can help you.

20:30.497 --> 20:32.231
<i>*</i>

20:36.869 --> 20:39.406
Have a nice day, Barry.

20:39.439 --> 20:40.640
- Cecile...

20:42.375 --> 20:45.912
<i>*</i>

20:55.154 --> 20:58.458
<i>*</i>

21:01.494 --> 21:06.499
<i>*</i>

21:17.410 --> 21:19.078
- No.

21:19.111 --> 21:21.581
I gotta make sure
everything's still there.

21:21.614 --> 21:24.083
<i>*</i>

21:38.465 --> 21:39.732
- Vault secured.

21:39.766 --> 21:41.968
- Okay. Be very careful.

21:42.001 --> 21:44.504
Until we get that mask
secure in S.T.A.R. Labs,

21:44.537 --> 21:47.474
<i>consider it dangerous.</i>

21:47.507 --> 21:49.909
<i>*</i>

21:49.942 --> 21:52.244
- Guys, we've got
a serious problem.

21:52.278 --> 21:54.013
I was reading
two brain signals,

21:54.046 --> 21:57.417
Barry and the mask,
but now there's a third.

21:57.450 --> 21:58.951
- But how's that possible?

21:58.985 --> 22:01.120
The mask is already
feeding off of Barry.

22:01.153 --> 22:03.990
- Must be targeting
someone else.

22:04.023 --> 22:05.358
- There's something
I've been trying to dig up.

22:05.392 --> 22:06.426
For a case.

22:06.459 --> 22:07.760
It's too bad you can't just

22:07.794 --> 22:10.162
grab the mask
from the museum, huh?

22:10.196 --> 22:11.798
- Oh my God.

22:11.831 --> 22:16.836
<i>*</i>

22:19.406 --> 22:20.640
<i>Sue, that's not Cecile.</i>

22:20.673 --> 22:22.341
<i>You need
to get out of there now.</i>

22:22.375 --> 22:27.013
<i>*</i>

22:27.046 --> 22:31.451
- A mortal weapon
against the likes of me?

22:31.484 --> 22:32.752
Pathetic.

22:32.785 --> 22:36.956
- Stop it! No!

22:36.989 --> 22:41.628
Okay, this is gonna suck.

22:42.929 --> 22:47.099
<i>*</i>

22:47.133 --> 22:50.870
- Since time began,
many have tried to stop me.

22:50.903 --> 22:53.740
All have failed.
- Cecile, this isn't you.

22:53.773 --> 22:55.642
- Let our friends go,
or we'll make you.

22:55.675 --> 22:57.243
- Such hubris.

22:57.276 --> 23:00.279
And from the boy who delivered
everything I needed.

23:00.312 --> 23:05.351
How amusing.
Now my host shall serve me.

23:05.384 --> 23:08.054
For eternity.

23:13.259 --> 23:14.961
- I'm up. I feel great.
I feel amazing.

23:14.994 --> 23:16.128
- No, no, no, no, no.
You're not going anywhere.

23:16.162 --> 23:18.397
Not for a little while.

23:18.431 --> 23:20.032
- Okay, fine.

23:20.066 --> 23:22.769
Since when does Cecile
have that kind of power?

23:22.802 --> 23:24.403
- She doesn't.
It was the mask.

23:24.437 --> 23:27.139
That was the voice
inside of our heads.

23:27.173 --> 23:29.942
She was possessed
just like Hayden

23:29.976 --> 23:31.177
and all the others before him.

23:31.210 --> 23:33.012
- Okay.
When did all this happen?

23:33.045 --> 23:35.648
- During the Force Storm,
we thought Cecile was hit

23:35.682 --> 23:37.249
by the Sage Force lightning.

23:37.283 --> 23:39.185
But it must have been
the psychic spirit of the mask

23:39.218 --> 23:41.621
that used that as a cover
to take over her mind.

23:41.654 --> 23:44.524
Now they're both missing.
We have no idea where they are.

23:44.557 --> 23:46.826
- Or what they're up to.
- We have to find her.

23:46.859 --> 23:49.161
That mask is the only link
to helping Barry

23:49.195 --> 23:51.931
and figuring out what happened
to the real Cecile.

23:51.964 --> 23:53.700
- The legend says that the mask

23:53.733 --> 23:56.368
gives the wielder
enhanced psychic powers.

23:56.402 --> 24:00.873
So maybe if we track
her neurological signals?

24:00.907 --> 24:03.175
- And how about
we let someone else

24:03.209 --> 24:05.377
come up with a plan
for a change?

24:05.411 --> 24:06.946
- Sue, Chester
was just trying to help.

24:06.979 --> 24:08.715
- Yeah, so was I
when I told him

24:08.748 --> 24:10.016
that this job seemed too easy.

24:10.049 --> 24:12.118
But he brushed me off,

24:12.151 --> 24:15.788
and I shot a tranq
into my own neck.

24:15.822 --> 24:19.325
- She's right. This is on me.

24:19.358 --> 24:21.728
- Chester, that thing
tricked all of us.

24:21.761 --> 24:23.229
- But you heard what it said.

24:23.262 --> 24:25.765
It put Barry in that coma,
just like Grodd did,

24:25.798 --> 24:29.669
to play me and zing
my insecurities as the new guy.

24:29.702 --> 24:32.605
It knew I'd pick Psycho Pirate
out of that binder

24:32.639 --> 24:35.207
and call Sue to help us
break into that museum.

24:35.241 --> 24:37.844
All to make me think
I had this all figured out.

24:39.846 --> 24:43.482
Really, I didn't know jack.

24:43.516 --> 24:45.818
<i>*</i>

24:48.855 --> 24:49.856
<i>*</i>

24:49.889 --> 24:51.223
- Oh, thank God.

24:51.257 --> 24:53.092
You're okay.

24:53.125 --> 24:56.462
- That thing that attacked me,
that was you.

24:56.495 --> 24:58.330
How is that possible?

24:58.364 --> 24:59.566
- I don't know.

24:59.599 --> 25:02.735
- Cecile, you said
there wasn't a second story.

25:02.769 --> 25:05.304
<i>*</i>

25:05.337 --> 25:06.939
There's no way
you could know that

25:06.973 --> 25:08.775
unless you've been here before.

25:08.808 --> 25:11.978
You know exactly where we are,
don't you?

25:12.011 --> 25:14.547
<i>*</i>

25:14.581 --> 25:17.083
- We're at St. Carmine's
Psychiatric Hospital,

25:17.116 --> 25:21.487
just outside
of Houston, Texas...

25:21.520 --> 25:23.022
where I was a patient.

25:23.055 --> 25:28.060
<i>*</i>

25:35.134 --> 25:40.940
- My first year in law school,
I--I got a job

25:40.973 --> 25:43.509
interning at the DA's office.

25:43.542 --> 25:46.212
It was so fulfilling.

25:46.245 --> 25:51.050
I was working around the clock
even when Mom got sick.

25:54.486 --> 25:58.290
And when we found out
that it was cancer, she said,

25:58.324 --> 26:02.629
"Cece, don't worry about me.

26:02.662 --> 26:03.930
"You keep working.

26:03.963 --> 26:07.566
I can feel myself
getting better already."

26:07.600 --> 26:11.938
I was in court
when I got the call.

26:11.971 --> 26:15.842
<i>*</i>

26:15.875 --> 26:18.544
She died all alone, Barry.

26:18.577 --> 26:20.212
<i>*</i>

26:20.246 --> 26:25.551
She died alone because of me.

26:25.584 --> 26:27.453
- Cecile.

26:27.486 --> 26:30.022
- After that, I couldn't eat,
I couldn't sleep.

26:30.056 --> 26:32.625
<i>*</i>

26:32.659 --> 26:35.895
Couldn't stop hating myself.

26:35.928 --> 26:39.498
<i>*</i>

26:39.531 --> 26:43.770
And I just spiraled
into anxiety and depression.

26:43.803 --> 26:47.774
<i>*</i>

26:47.807 --> 26:51.143
And then I had a breakdown
and I ended up in here.

26:51.177 --> 26:54.814
<i>Most days I'd just
wander those halls.</i>

26:54.847 --> 26:57.383
I'd spend all night lying awake

26:57.416 --> 27:00.787
staring at that ceiling
thinking about my mom.

27:00.820 --> 27:02.188
<i>*</i>

27:02.221 --> 27:07.559
When I finally checked out,
I was so ashamed

27:07.593 --> 27:11.130
and afraid
that all of that darkness

27:11.163 --> 27:12.732
<i>was gonna catch up
to me again,</i>

27:12.765 --> 27:17.369
and so I...

27:17.403 --> 27:22.374
I told myself, "Toughen up.

27:22.408 --> 27:25.111
Toughen--toughen up.
That's it. Smile."

27:25.144 --> 27:27.113
<i>*</i>

27:27.146 --> 27:30.249
"And you pretend
like this never happened."

27:30.282 --> 27:32.484
And that is exactly what I did.

27:32.518 --> 27:37.757
- And you hid all that pain,
but it never went away.

27:39.125 --> 27:42.628
- I carry it with me every day.

27:44.096 --> 27:47.599
- Cecile...

27:47.633 --> 27:51.170
I'm never gonna know
what it was like for you

27:51.203 --> 27:53.172
to go through all this.

27:53.205 --> 27:55.942
But I know what it's like
to lose a mom.

27:55.975 --> 28:02.715
And to blame yourself for it,
even when it's not your fault.

28:02.749 --> 28:06.085
It makes you want to take that
pain and bury it under a mask.

28:06.118 --> 28:09.321
Away from the people you love.

28:09.355 --> 28:12.825
But masks don't heal wounds.

28:12.859 --> 28:14.493
They only hide them.

28:14.526 --> 28:17.329
Facing those wounds
can be scary as hell,

28:17.363 --> 28:20.166
but it's the only way
to start healing.

28:20.199 --> 28:24.670
- What if I can't do it?

28:24.703 --> 28:28.741
- You can. I know it.

28:28.775 --> 28:33.780
<i>*</i>

28:36.415 --> 28:39.318
Maybe that's our way
out of here.

28:39.351 --> 28:41.353
This is your memory.

28:41.387 --> 28:43.655
That thing is just amplifying
your fears.

28:43.689 --> 28:47.026
When the door opened before,
what were you thinking about?

28:47.059 --> 28:48.627
- The truth about my time here.

28:48.660 --> 28:53.199
But, Barry, I'm thinking
about it right now.

28:53.232 --> 28:54.934
Nothing's changing.

28:57.336 --> 28:58.604
- You sure about that?

28:58.637 --> 29:00.472
<i>*</i>

29:00.506 --> 29:05.144
If you face this,
if you can confront your past,

29:05.177 --> 29:07.880
I believe you can get us home.

29:11.750 --> 29:13.152
- Okay.

29:14.120 --> 29:15.721
- Hey, you okay?
- Yeah.

29:15.754 --> 29:18.757
I need more neuro-fiber
to fix the memory machine,

29:18.791 --> 29:20.659
so we can use it
like we did against Grodd,

29:20.692 --> 29:22.161
but we don't have
enough supplies here.

29:22.194 --> 29:25.097
So I gotta go back
to my garage.

29:25.131 --> 29:26.899
Shouldn't be here anyway.

29:27.666 --> 29:32.171
- Wait, Chester.
Yes, you should, Chester.

29:32.204 --> 29:34.907
I mean, this is--it's your lab.

29:34.941 --> 29:38.610
- No, Iris. It's not.

29:38.644 --> 29:40.312
- What?

29:40.346 --> 29:42.048
- Look, I didn't come
to S.T.A.R. Labs

29:42.081 --> 29:44.316
to replace Cisco.

29:44.350 --> 29:46.685
I came here to work with him.

29:46.718 --> 29:49.822
And I want to do a good job
more than anything.

29:49.856 --> 29:55.194
But when I saw Barry
in trouble today,

29:55.227 --> 29:57.396
Iris, I didn't even know
where to start.

29:57.429 --> 30:01.133
I thought to myself, you know,
what would Cisco do?

30:03.402 --> 30:06.805
Decided I'm gonna act
confident and brave.

30:06.839 --> 30:09.008
<i>*</i>

30:09.041 --> 30:12.044
Act like I had it
all figured out.

30:14.580 --> 30:21.620
- Chester, confidence
isn't what made Cisco Cisco.

30:21.653 --> 30:23.822
- I know.

30:23.856 --> 30:27.126
What made Cisco Cisco
was the connections

30:27.159 --> 30:30.162
and the love
that he had for you all.

30:30.196 --> 30:32.664
Don't you get it?

30:32.698 --> 30:37.103
I don't have those bonds, Iris.
I barely know you guys.

30:37.136 --> 30:40.472
And I can't help with thinking
that if I just knew Team Flash

30:40.506 --> 30:42.574
a little bit better,
that I would have been able

30:42.608 --> 30:45.111
to figure out that
that wasn't the real Cecile.

30:45.144 --> 30:46.312
And then this entire thing
just would--

30:46.345 --> 30:48.847
- Okay. Okay.

30:48.881 --> 30:52.151
Chester, Cisco didn't form
these bonds overnight.

30:52.184 --> 30:54.220
It took time. It took patience.

30:54.253 --> 30:57.456
And we all have your back.

30:57.489 --> 31:01.093
Just like we know
that you've got ours.

31:01.127 --> 31:02.328
- Thanks.

31:02.361 --> 31:05.932
And look, Iris,
I promise, okay?

31:05.965 --> 31:08.834
From today on,
I'm really gonna up my game,

31:08.867 --> 31:10.736
and I'm gonna, like--

31:13.772 --> 31:15.341
<i>*</i>

31:15.374 --> 31:18.244
I think I know
where Psycho-Cecile is going.

31:18.277 --> 31:19.578
<i>*</i>

31:19.611 --> 31:22.681
Back at the museum,
the mask said

31:22.714 --> 31:25.417
it wanted Cecile
to be its host for eternity.

31:25.451 --> 31:26.885
But the legend says

31:26.919 --> 31:29.321
that once the mask
feeds on the host's mind,

31:29.355 --> 31:31.157
it moves on to another.

31:31.190 --> 31:32.824
- So if Cecilia is an empath,

31:32.858 --> 31:35.361
then maybe that makes her
a stronger host.

31:35.394 --> 31:36.362
- But not strong enough.

31:36.395 --> 31:38.164
She would need something

31:38.197 --> 31:40.666
to amplify
her mental abilities.

31:40.699 --> 31:43.035
To create a permanent
food source.

31:43.069 --> 31:45.337
- Okay. So where do we find
a device like that?

31:45.371 --> 31:47.339
<i>*</i>

31:47.373 --> 31:49.175
- In our basement.

31:52.211 --> 31:57.216
<i>*</i>

32:00.552 --> 32:04.823
- At last.
The key to permanence.

32:04.856 --> 32:07.759
<i>*</i>

32:13.165 --> 32:14.166
- Barry's about to experience

32:14.200 --> 32:15.534
complete brain death.

32:15.567 --> 32:17.236
Please tell me we have a plan.

32:17.269 --> 32:19.505
- We think the mask is trying
to use the Thinker's chair

32:19.538 --> 32:23.175
to create
a permanent bond with Cecile.

32:23.209 --> 32:25.777
- Oh, frak!
She's already there.

32:25.811 --> 32:28.314
- How the hell are we
gonna stop this thing?

32:28.347 --> 32:30.916
- Okay,
this is gonna sound crazy...

32:30.949 --> 32:32.584
- Crazy works sometimes.

32:32.618 --> 32:33.885
- It's just--I don't know
if it's the best idea.

32:33.919 --> 32:34.953
- Look, Chester,

32:34.987 --> 32:36.388
if you believe
that it will work,

32:36.422 --> 32:38.757
then I do too.

32:38.790 --> 32:40.392
- Okay.

32:43.429 --> 32:45.031
<i>*</i>

32:45.064 --> 32:47.433
- This is where
the portal was before.

32:47.466 --> 32:49.568
That's our only way out.

32:52.804 --> 32:57.609
<i>*</i>

32:57.643 --> 32:59.478
- What's happening
to this place?

32:59.511 --> 33:04.516
<i>*</i>

33:11.390 --> 33:14.093
You can't leave here.

33:14.126 --> 33:18.897
You belong here. Forever.

33:18.930 --> 33:23.935
<i>*</i>

33:29.375 --> 33:31.009
- Barry!

33:31.043 --> 33:33.979
- And this time,
you're never checking out.

33:34.012 --> 33:39.017
<i>*</i>

33:43.322 --> 33:46.992
- Who dares avoid my gaze?

33:47.025 --> 33:53.832
<i>*</i>

33:53.865 --> 33:55.167
- I do.

33:55.201 --> 34:00.206
<i>*</i>

34:17.623 --> 34:21.927
- You can't trap me in here.
This is my mind, not yours.

34:21.960 --> 34:25.264
- Ooh, so brave.

34:25.297 --> 34:29.301
But you weren't so brave
for Mommy, were you, Cecile?

34:30.669 --> 34:32.671
<i>*</i>

34:32.704 --> 34:34.440
- Don't you remember her?

34:34.473 --> 34:39.878
Your mommy dying alone
in a hospital bed

34:39.911 --> 34:41.880
calling out for her
only daughter,

34:41.913 --> 34:46.185
"Where is she?
Where is my sweet Cece?"

34:47.586 --> 34:52.591
<i>*</i>

35:05.904 --> 35:09.341
- I can sense the faith
you have in yourself.

35:09.375 --> 35:11.109
It's the faith of a fool!

35:17.449 --> 35:20.152
- Oh you cracked once,

35:20.186 --> 35:22.554
and you will crack again.

35:22.588 --> 35:28.894
And then you'll be a psycho
just like me.

35:29.995 --> 35:33.064
- I used to think that.
I used to think that too.

35:33.098 --> 35:34.800
I was so afraid
of losing myself

35:34.833 --> 35:39.638
that I hid a piece of me away,

35:39.671 --> 35:43.975
but I am not ashamed
of it anymore.

35:47.012 --> 35:52.017
<i>*</i>

35:56.455 --> 35:59.991
So go ahead.
Try and scare me.

36:00.025 --> 36:04.330
But I know exactly who I am,
and I am done wearing a mask.

36:04.363 --> 36:09.668
<i>*</i>

36:13.239 --> 36:17.142
<i>*</i>

36:17.175 --> 36:22.180
- Ahh!

36:25.217 --> 36:32.123
<i>*</i>

36:36.562 --> 36:38.764
- Barry, Barry, the portal.

36:41.800 --> 36:46.204
<i>*</i>

36:46.238 --> 36:49.174
- Barry! You're okay.

36:49.207 --> 36:50.309
- Cecile.

36:50.342 --> 36:53.579
<i>*</i>

36:53.612 --> 36:56.682
- No, don't shoot.
Don't shoot.

36:56.715 --> 36:58.216
It's me, it's me, it's me.

36:58.250 --> 37:02.288
<i>*</i>

37:07.259 --> 37:08.394
- So what happens

37:08.427 --> 37:09.895
with that crazy mask now?

37:09.928 --> 37:12.163
- Yeah. Caitlin's taking it
to A.R.G.U.S.

37:12.197 --> 37:14.032
with an armored escort
as we speak.

37:14.065 --> 37:16.268
She's gonna help Cisco
retrofit a vault there

37:16.302 --> 37:17.803
with medical dampeners

37:17.836 --> 37:22.107
that'll keep the mask
from finding more victims.

37:22.140 --> 37:25.010
- So, Sue, I'm sure you can't
wait to get out of here, huh?

37:25.043 --> 37:27.112
- All right. Relax, Chester.

37:27.145 --> 37:29.615
Iris explained everything
to me.

37:29.648 --> 37:32.684
And I'm sorry
that I was so harsh.

37:34.152 --> 37:37.222
I guess getting whammied
makes me grumpy.

37:37.255 --> 37:38.624
<i>*</i>

37:38.657 --> 37:40.826
As for my next move,
Ralph is still busy,

37:40.859 --> 37:43.194
and I did miss Central City.

37:43.228 --> 37:46.064
So I think I'm gonna
stick around for a while.

37:46.097 --> 37:48.900
I'm staying at the penthouse
suite of the Lily Hotel.

37:48.934 --> 37:51.503
Nightcaps and a late dinner
on my terrace?

37:51.537 --> 37:53.772
My treat.
Yes.

37:53.805 --> 37:56.342
- Yes.
- Yeah? All right.

37:56.375 --> 37:57.543
See you there.

37:57.576 --> 37:58.610
<i>*</i>

37:58.644 --> 38:01.680
- Um, hey, Barry...

38:01.713 --> 38:05.250
<i>*</i>

38:05.283 --> 38:07.052
You know,
if it weren't for you,

38:07.085 --> 38:09.988
I probably never would've
gotten out of that place.

38:10.021 --> 38:15.160
- No. It was all you.
And I knew you could do it.

38:15.193 --> 38:19.130
But I'm not the only one
that believes in you.

38:19.164 --> 38:21.333
- I know.

38:21.367 --> 38:24.836
I should probably go home
and talk to Joe.

38:24.870 --> 38:27.172
Few things I should tell him.

38:27.205 --> 38:28.540
Tell Sue rain check.

38:28.574 --> 38:30.676
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

38:30.709 --> 38:32.411
- Chester, are you coming?

38:32.444 --> 38:34.813
I mean, I know you're more
of a root beer kind of guy,

38:34.846 --> 38:36.415
but you've earned
a victory meal too.

38:36.448 --> 38:37.816
- Really?

38:37.849 --> 38:39.284
Even after falling
for the wrath

38:39.317 --> 38:43.955
of some omnipotent,
psychotropic, immortal mask?

38:46.358 --> 38:48.794
You know, after saying it
out loud and hearing it back,

38:48.827 --> 38:50.662
I'm kind of like,
you know-

38:50.696 --> 38:52.063
Yeah, count me in.

38:52.097 --> 38:55.367
- Chester, you are
a full-fledged member

38:55.401 --> 38:56.702
of Team Flash now.

38:56.735 --> 38:58.737
Your voice will
always matter here.

38:58.770 --> 39:01.407
Just make sure you use it.

39:01.440 --> 39:04.075
- Yeah. Okay.

39:04.109 --> 39:08.780
With that being said, there
is a--just this tiny thing

39:08.814 --> 39:12.017
that I wanted to talk
to you both about.

39:12.050 --> 39:14.252
- Yeah, what's up?
- Okay.

39:14.285 --> 39:17.456
So you know, the next time
you guys wanna, you know...

39:17.489 --> 39:18.924
- Oh
- Yeah.

39:18.957 --> 39:21.560
Please just, you know,
take a day off, maybe?

39:21.593 --> 39:23.128
Or go on vacation.

39:23.161 --> 39:24.530
- A vacation. Yeah.
- Totally. We hear you. Yeah.

39:24.563 --> 39:25.731
- Yeah. Okay. Cool. Yeah.

39:25.764 --> 39:26.998
- Cool.
- Kay, bye.

39:27.032 --> 39:28.567
- All right.
- Yeah. Bye.

39:31.603 --> 39:36.608
<i>*</i>

39:41.379 --> 39:43.682
- Babe, I had no idea.

39:43.715 --> 39:46.017
Why didn't you
tell me this before?

39:48.820 --> 39:51.256
- I didn't want you
to see me differently.

39:52.390 --> 39:53.959
Or think that I was weak.

39:53.992 --> 39:58.163
- Oh, Cecile,

39:58.196 --> 40:01.399
I know what it's like
in our community.

40:02.267 --> 40:05.704
There's sometimes a shame
in asking for help

40:05.737 --> 40:07.839
when it comes to mental health.

40:09.808 --> 40:13.244
With what our families
go through,

40:13.278 --> 40:16.081
on top of everything else
in this world...

40:19.451 --> 40:21.887
It could crush us.

40:21.920 --> 40:26.992
But we need to start
taking good care of ourselves.

40:27.025 --> 40:30.929
And that's just what you did,
so don't apologize.

40:30.962 --> 40:34.500
Just know that I will always

40:34.533 --> 40:38.604
be here for you.

40:39.538 --> 40:45.511
And we will get through this
or anything together.

40:48.547 --> 40:50.482
<i>*</i>

40:50.516 --> 40:51.983
- Love you.

40:52.017 --> 40:53.585
- I love you.

40:53.619 --> 40:56.354
<i>*</i>

40:56.387 --> 41:00.626
- Hey, whatever happened
with Fort Dakota?

41:00.659 --> 41:02.227
- Yeah.

41:02.260 --> 41:05.263
You weren't the only one
wearing a mask.

41:05.296 --> 41:07.298
There's a reason
that Kristen Kramer

41:07.332 --> 41:10.035
wants this part of her past
to stay buried.

41:12.137 --> 41:16.608
Kramer's last army mission,

41:16.642 --> 41:18.409
she was in command of a squad

41:18.443 --> 41:23.048
sent in to take out
several strategic facilities.

41:23.081 --> 41:25.717
She never completed
the mission.

41:25.751 --> 41:28.286
She led them into an ambush.

41:28.319 --> 41:31.489
- Oh my God.
- Yeah, there's more.

41:31.523 --> 41:34.392
<i>*</i>

41:34.425 --> 41:37.563
She was the only one
that survived.

41:37.596 --> 41:43.702
Cecile, I think Kristen Kramer
was working with the enemy.

41:43.735 --> 41:47.138
<i>*</i>

41:53.679 --> 41:58.684

42:09.695 --> 42:10.962
- Greg, move your head.
