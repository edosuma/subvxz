01:30.512 --> 01:32.517
Son of a bitch.

01:33.720 --> 01:36.356
Damn people
driving around.

01:36.358 --> 01:38.359
What's the matter? What,
are you fucking stupid?

01:38.361 --> 01:39.865
Are you stupid?

01:51.454 --> 01:53.356
It's going to cost you $200.

01:53.358 --> 01:55.761
But, hey, who cares?
It's Vegas, right?

01:55.763 --> 01:57.499
It's Vegas.

01:59.871 --> 02:02.811
It's not like you need
the money, right?

02:23.451 --> 02:26.058
- Henry?
- Yeah, yeah. Hop on in.

02:28.830 --> 02:30.865
Welcome to Las Vegas.

02:30.867 --> 02:33.069
Thanks, man.
Thrilled to be here.

02:33.071 --> 02:35.811
Well, hope you can
check it off your list.

02:36.979 --> 02:39.047
How long you been in Vegas?

02:40.586 --> 02:42.688
My whole life.

02:42.690 --> 02:43.758
Sweet.

02:43.760 --> 02:45.727
That must be nice.

02:45.729 --> 02:46.964
No. No, it isn't.

03:11.682 --> 03:13.216
Mirage.

03:13.218 --> 03:15.156
Yeah, it's on the phone.

03:24.842 --> 03:26.610
I mean, just take a look around
at this place.

03:26.612 --> 03:28.916
Look at it.
I mean, it's...

03:29.951 --> 03:31.653
It's got, you know,

03:31.655 --> 03:33.791
money in its veins, you know?

03:33.793 --> 03:35.160
The whole reason it's here

03:35.162 --> 03:37.132
is to make just a couple
people richer.

03:50.058 --> 03:51.763
So, the Mirage, huh?

03:53.098 --> 03:55.470
Means you got
a big client.

03:57.006 --> 03:59.108
Going to have enough
to tip me on the way back?

03:59.110 --> 04:02.548
I thought you weren't allowed
to accept tips.

04:02.550 --> 04:05.255
I thought prostitution
was illegal.

04:07.727 --> 04:09.863
No, no, not supposed to.

04:09.865 --> 04:11.733
Sorry?

04:11.735 --> 04:13.269
Not supposed
to accept tips.

04:13.271 --> 04:14.908
You're right.

04:19.784 --> 04:21.184
Maybe I can get you
on the way back.

04:21.185 --> 04:23.723
I don't have any cash
right now.

04:23.725 --> 04:26.194
Sure.

04:26.196 --> 04:28.099
Almost there.

04:28.101 --> 04:29.334
Thank you.

04:29.336 --> 04:31.040
No problem.

04:34.312 --> 04:36.816
Should I stick around?

04:36.818 --> 04:38.086
I'm sorry?

04:38.088 --> 04:39.387
Should I stick around?

04:39.389 --> 04:40.791
Oh, no.

04:40.793 --> 04:43.028
I'll just call someone.

04:43.030 --> 04:45.266
Okay.

04:45.268 --> 04:48.038
I mean, you know,
Vegas actually is the one city

04:48.040 --> 04:51.312
where money can buy you
anything.

04:52.817 --> 04:54.351
Oh, but if you don't
have money...

04:54.353 --> 04:56.022
well...

04:56.024 --> 04:57.694
go fuck yourself.

04:58.762 --> 05:00.801
It's ridiculous,
it's ridiculous.

05:02.402 --> 05:04.039
Good luck to you.

05:05.175 --> 05:07.848
Thank you.
Have a good night.

05:43.885 --> 05:46.454
<i>Good morning.
This is your wake-up call.</i>

05:46.456 --> 05:48.127
Fuck you.

06:27.539 --> 06:29.978
<i>You know I can't reinstate you.</i>

06:31.379 --> 06:33.550
It's been three years.

06:33.552 --> 06:36.826
Yeah, but I've seen
no improvement.

06:42.301 --> 06:45.940
I see two assault charges.

06:45.942 --> 06:48.045
One against
a fellow officer.

06:48.047 --> 06:50.318
Two restraining orders
against you.

06:53.959 --> 06:55.496
One from your new ex-wife.

06:56.497 --> 06:58.331
We're separated.

06:58.333 --> 07:02.608
Tell me, are you still
investigating your wife's murder?

07:04.078 --> 07:06.015
Yes, I am.

07:06.017 --> 07:08.520
You're not on that case.
You never were.

07:08.522 --> 07:10.490
You know who's on that case?

07:10.492 --> 07:12.127
Nobody.

07:12.129 --> 07:14.030
It's sitting in a box
on a shelf somewhere

07:14.032 --> 07:16.467
collecting dust until this guy
shows up and kills another woman

07:16.469 --> 07:18.474
the same way
he killed Helen.

07:19.543 --> 07:21.345
Listen, I get it.

07:21.347 --> 07:25.653
If my wife were killed,
I'd do the exact same thing.

07:25.655 --> 07:27.190
But I'm not your therapist.

07:27.192 --> 07:29.628
And I'm not here to sympathize
with you.

07:29.630 --> 07:33.971
I'm here to protect the
department from another lawsuit.

07:33.973 --> 07:36.040
We live in a new age.

07:36.042 --> 07:39.180
Everyone has
a fucking camera.

07:39.182 --> 07:41.420
We can't have a loose cannon
on the force.

07:57.452 --> 08:00.055
Man, you got stuff?

08:00.057 --> 08:01.425
No. Go, go away.

08:01.427 --> 08:02.560
No.

08:02.562 --> 08:04.131
Come on, man.
I got money.

08:04.133 --> 08:05.601
Just go. Leave me...

08:05.603 --> 08:07.037
leave me alone.

08:07.039 --> 08:08.471
Come on, man.
You know that...

08:08.473 --> 08:10.142
you know that good stuff
you gave me last time?

08:10.144 --> 08:11.445
You got to be kidding
right now.

08:11.447 --> 08:13.816
- What? What do you want?
- That good stuff.

08:13.818 --> 08:15.787
Look, I don't have anything,
all right?

08:15.789 --> 08:18.125
I got money this time.

08:18.127 --> 08:19.796
Goddamn junkies.

08:19.798 --> 08:22.067
Look, you ask me this
every night.

08:22.069 --> 08:24.136
Do you... you just
don't remember?

08:24.138 --> 08:26.843
Look, I don't have anything.
Just get off my car.

08:26.845 --> 08:28.713
Go. You scratch it,
I'll beat the shit out of you.

08:28.715 --> 08:30.216
- Go.
- Be cool.

08:30.218 --> 08:32.251
- Just go.
- Just chill, chill, chill.

08:35.629 --> 08:36.794
Goddamn.

08:47.619 --> 08:49.488
Start journaling.

08:49.490 --> 08:52.193
Give me something
to put on file.

08:52.195 --> 08:53.562
<i>Just use your cell phone.</i>

08:53.564 --> 08:56.502
<i>Give me five minutes
every day.</i>

08:56.504 --> 08:58.338
<i>Text me.</i>

08:58.340 --> 08:59.575
<i>You don't have to come in.</i>

08:59.577 --> 09:02.580
<i>You don't even
have to see me.</i>

09:02.582 --> 09:03.883
<i>I want to help you.</i>

09:03.885 --> 09:06.391
<i>But you got to help me.</i>

09:09.930 --> 09:11.632
<i>All right?</i>

09:11.634 --> 09:13.469
<i>I'm not the bad guy here.</i>

09:13.471 --> 09:15.874
<i>So why am I?</i>

09:15.876 --> 09:18.513
<i>You beat the shit out of
those two dealers in broad daylight.</i>

09:18.515 --> 09:21.821
<i>You scared the hell
out of your ex-wife.</i>

09:45.502 --> 09:47.336
Hi. Alicia?

09:48.541 --> 09:49.909
Yup, that's me.

09:49.911 --> 09:53.752
All right, well,
welcome aboard.

10:03.036 --> 10:04.774
Okay.

10:15.995 --> 10:18.234
Let's do this.

10:22.843 --> 10:24.548
Okay.

10:27.017 --> 10:30.856
Three years ago,
I was working undercover.

10:30.858 --> 10:34.601
I was running drugs for an
organization out of Mexico City.

10:36.805 --> 10:39.373
Got into some
pretty rough stuff.

10:39.375 --> 10:43.051
Um... my cover was blown.

10:47.526 --> 10:49.729
And they killed my wife.

10:52.736 --> 10:54.971
You're a piece of shit!

11:12.441 --> 11:17.016
So, uh, it's Treasure Island
you're going to, right?

11:17.018 --> 11:18.419
Right, yes.

11:18.421 --> 11:19.922
You know, um,

11:19.924 --> 11:22.960
my favorite place
on the Strip was the Riv.

11:22.962 --> 11:25.733
- And it was... the Riviera.
- Right.

11:25.735 --> 11:27.970
It's right up the street
from Treasure Island.

11:27.972 --> 11:32.180
And they had dollar blackjack,
dollar roulette, I think.

11:32.182 --> 11:35.151
Anyway, now the bastards
are just tearing it down.

11:35.153 --> 11:37.691
Making it a convention center.

11:37.693 --> 11:39.627
It's just...

11:39.629 --> 11:41.801
That sucks.

11:55.027 --> 11:57.931
Um...

11:57.933 --> 11:59.834
So, yeah, yeah.

11:59.836 --> 12:01.571
I, um, I beat up some guys.

12:01.573 --> 12:04.276
Some local...
drug pushers.

12:04.278 --> 12:07.018
Just piece-of-shit scumbags.

12:08.888 --> 12:11.929
I can't say that I wouldn't
do it again.

12:18.107 --> 12:22.015
I can say I wouldn't
do it again.

12:30.096 --> 12:33.101
I wouldn't do it again.

12:33.103 --> 12:35.238
Not because I give a shit
about them,

12:35.240 --> 12:37.910
but because of the job.

12:37.912 --> 12:39.683
I'm a good cop.

12:45.596 --> 12:46.962
Well...

12:46.964 --> 12:48.900
question.

12:48.902 --> 12:52.173
Do you know a good place
to get drinks around here?

12:52.175 --> 12:54.612
Possibly?

12:54.614 --> 12:56.114
Yeah, yeah.

12:56.116 --> 12:58.218
You want to make
a detour?

12:58.220 --> 13:01.256
Is that possible?
Yes, please.

13:01.258 --> 13:02.894
I guess it's possible.

13:02.896 --> 13:04.801
Yeah, of course.

13:06.738 --> 13:10.042
Yeah, I know this place
right off the Strip,

13:10.044 --> 13:12.012
it's tucked away.

13:12.014 --> 13:14.887
There's great drink specials
yet it's quiet.

13:16.824 --> 13:18.157
Something like that?

13:18.159 --> 13:19.827
Um...

13:19.829 --> 13:22.032
yeah, I kind of meant
like a...

13:22.034 --> 13:24.138
like a liquor store.

13:25.776 --> 13:27.008
Yeah. Yeah...

13:27.010 --> 13:28.980
- I'm sorry.
- No, no. I know.

13:28.982 --> 13:31.787
I know.

13:33.724 --> 13:35.260
I didn't mean for...

13:37.031 --> 13:38.733
- No...
- Sorry.

13:38.735 --> 13:40.401
No, that's not what...
I wasn't thinking that.

13:40.403 --> 13:42.305
I just, you know...

13:42.307 --> 13:45.446
if you wanted to come back
with somebody else... you know,

13:45.448 --> 13:46.949
that's a good spot.

13:46.951 --> 13:49.019
Oh, well...

13:49.021 --> 13:51.694
maybe you could
show me sometime.

13:53.832 --> 13:55.703
Sure.

14:04.118 --> 14:06.186
Do you mind waiting here
for just a moment?

14:06.188 --> 14:08.124
I'll be right back.

14:08.126 --> 14:09.460
Yeah, sure.

14:09.462 --> 14:11.200
Awesome. Thank you.

14:16.308 --> 14:19.146
Stupid.

14:19.148 --> 14:21.450
What do you think
you're doing, huh?

14:21.452 --> 14:24.323
What, do you think
she likes you?

14:26.362 --> 14:29.000
Get over yourself, Henry.

14:29.002 --> 14:31.971
She doesn't like you.
She's just another whore.

14:31.973 --> 14:33.575
Just another whore.

14:33.577 --> 14:37.583
What are you going to do, huh?
Huh? You going to do it?

15:09.182 --> 15:10.886
Hello?

15:11.887 --> 15:13.420
Oh, hey, Dee.

15:13.422 --> 15:16.193
Yeah, I'm coming.
I'm on my way.

15:18.100 --> 15:20.004
Wait, what?

15:21.205 --> 15:22.607
What do you mean
the strippers are...?

15:22.609 --> 15:24.914
Dee, make him wait.
You know he's mine.

15:26.181 --> 15:27.983
Okay.

15:27.985 --> 15:30.656
Yes, I'm on my way.
I'm on my way. I'm coming.

15:30.658 --> 15:33.629
All right, I'm coming.
I'll see you soon. Alright.

15:33.631 --> 15:35.234
Bye.

15:36.368 --> 15:38.037
Sorry about that.

15:38.039 --> 15:39.975
Big party, huh?

15:39.977 --> 15:42.382
Yeah. Bachelorette party.

15:49.027 --> 15:51.100
Hey, do you want
a drink?

15:52.301 --> 15:54.972
Can't. I'm driving.

15:54.974 --> 15:57.710
I won't tell anyone.

15:57.712 --> 16:00.952
Wouldn't want to crash,
now would we?

16:08.065 --> 16:09.501
Uh... hey.

16:09.503 --> 16:12.373
Isn't Treasure Island
just down the street?

16:12.375 --> 16:15.212
It's just a shortcut.

16:15.214 --> 16:16.648
Look, I appreciate that,

16:16.650 --> 16:19.352
but Treasure Island's
just down the road.

16:21.058 --> 16:23.394
Oh, you're right.
I'm...

16:23.396 --> 16:25.167
Yeah, I'm sorry.

16:28.372 --> 16:30.542
You should have done it
when you had the chance.

16:30.544 --> 16:32.614
When did I have
the chance?

16:32.616 --> 16:34.386
What?

16:35.621 --> 16:37.188
Nothing. Sorry.

16:37.190 --> 16:38.694
Sorry.

16:41.433 --> 16:42.833
Can you just
get me there?

16:42.835 --> 16:44.370
Yeah, absolutely.

16:44.372 --> 16:45.840
- Thanks.
- Get you right there.

16:45.842 --> 16:47.512
Thank you.

17:04.244 --> 17:05.679
We're there.

17:05.681 --> 17:07.148
Thanks.

17:07.151 --> 17:09.119
Have a good night, huh?

17:09.122 --> 17:10.458
You too.

17:17.571 --> 17:19.309
God...

17:22.414 --> 17:24.650
I just need to get my hands
on her.

17:24.652 --> 17:25.887
I like her too.

17:25.888 --> 17:27.923
What do you think
I'll do with her?

17:27.925 --> 17:29.861
Oh, we'll have a great time.

17:29.863 --> 17:32.533
I'll tell you
what she was like.

17:32.535 --> 17:34.603
Tell you how wet she was.

17:38.914 --> 17:41.687
<i>One West 823, over.</i>

17:42.956 --> 17:45.358
<i>Go ahead, One West 823.</i>

17:51.438 --> 17:55.445
<i>Please stand by while
I notify Homicide and the coroner.</i>

17:55.447 --> 17:58.451
<i>One West 823, standing by.</i>

17:58.453 --> 18:00.723
<i>One North 89 en route.</i>

18:00.725 --> 18:02.694
<i>ETA: 20 minutes.</i>

18:02.696 --> 18:05.699
<i>Has the scene been secured?</i>

18:05.701 --> 18:07.604
<i>The scene's secure.</i>

18:07.606 --> 18:12.346
<i>We have a Jane Doe,
mid-30's, roughly decomposed.</i>

18:44.779 --> 18:46.682
You're late.

18:46.684 --> 18:48.519
I was sleeping.

18:48.521 --> 18:50.321
Passed out.

18:50.323 --> 18:52.927
Whatever. It's not like
I'm on the job anymore.

18:52.929 --> 18:55.499
No, but you still
showed up.

18:55.501 --> 18:57.305
Yeah.

19:10.731 --> 19:12.667
Moved the body already.

19:12.669 --> 19:13.869
Yeah.

19:13.871 --> 19:15.538
We considered
waiting for you,

19:15.540 --> 19:17.542
but you're not part
of the force anymore, so...

19:17.544 --> 19:19.949
That's two this month.

19:20.985 --> 19:22.451
Yeah.

19:22.453 --> 19:23.788
This one was pretty well
decomposed

19:23.790 --> 19:25.893
by the time
we got to it, so...

19:25.895 --> 19:27.629
Let me guess.

19:27.631 --> 19:29.501
Blunt force trauma?

19:29.503 --> 19:32.609
Most likely a crowbar?

19:35.446 --> 19:38.718
Yeah. But it's not
a serial killer, so... enough.

19:38.720 --> 19:40.455
This is a big-ass desert.

19:40.457 --> 19:42.927
If you find two,
there's 20 out here.

19:42.929 --> 19:45.131
Are you done?
I want to get out of here.

19:45.133 --> 19:47.904
Yeah, I got what I need.

19:47.906 --> 19:49.974
Come on, man,
give me something.

19:49.976 --> 19:52.680
You want something?
Sober up, get on the scanner.

19:52.682 --> 19:53.915
Maybe show up before
we clear the scene.

19:53.917 --> 19:56.022
Get your shit together.

22:52.106 --> 22:53.239
Fuck.

23:18.893 --> 23:20.595
Hey, I'm here.

23:20.597 --> 23:22.467
Okay.

23:26.407 --> 23:27.943
- Hey.
- Hey.

23:27.945 --> 23:29.145
- How are you?
- Good, how are you?

23:29.147 --> 23:30.517
Good.

24:11.464 --> 24:14.502
<i>Well, I've been told that
I have trouble letting go.</i>

24:14.504 --> 24:17.709
<i>Actually...</i>

24:17.711 --> 24:19.178
Debbie told me that

24:19.180 --> 24:20.681
right before
she kicked me out,

24:20.683 --> 24:22.720
so maybe it's true.

24:22.722 --> 24:27.430
Spent three years investigating
my deceased wife, Helen.

24:29.736 --> 24:31.606
And then I get
remarried to...

24:33.242 --> 24:35.478
this chick.

24:35.480 --> 24:37.482
And she calls it quits
after six months.

24:37.484 --> 24:40.190
So, yeah,
maybe that's true.

24:41.491 --> 24:43.630
She's too young
for me anyway.

24:45.332 --> 24:47.535
She got daddy issues.

24:57.056 --> 24:58.792
<i>What the fuck are you doing?</i>

25:00.262 --> 25:01.496
<i>Are you fucking
stalking me?</i>

25:01.498 --> 25:03.835
- No.
- <i>Oh, my God.</i>

25:03.837 --> 25:05.437
This is a stakeout.

25:05.439 --> 25:07.140
I'm calling the real
fucking police.

25:07.142 --> 25:08.577
Yeah, go ahead.

25:08.579 --> 25:11.249
I'm 50 yards
away from the property.

25:11.251 --> 25:13.620
So you think you can just
sit there and watch me

25:13.622 --> 25:15.090
from 50 yards away?

25:15.092 --> 25:16.694
<i>I don't...
No, I'm not.</i>

25:16.696 --> 25:20.401
Really, you're going
to send Joe Cool over here?

25:20.403 --> 25:22.241
Debbie...

25:28.486 --> 25:30.320
Just move the fucking car.

25:30.322 --> 25:33.359
Yeah? "Move the fucking car."
Go back in the fucking house.

25:33.361 --> 25:34.629
Art...

25:34.631 --> 25:35.832
I'm out of here.

25:35.834 --> 25:37.435
Just go back inside.

25:37.437 --> 25:39.271
You don't want to mess
with this right now.

25:39.273 --> 25:41.111
Thank you.

25:43.717 --> 25:44.917
Fucking Ken doll.

25:44.919 --> 25:46.757
It'll be okay.

26:23.729 --> 26:25.464
Guess what?

26:25.466 --> 26:27.468
We just got married.

26:30.677 --> 26:33.412
Our Elvis was the minister.

26:33.414 --> 26:34.682
No, he's...

26:34.684 --> 26:35.852
Wait, oh, wait.

26:35.854 --> 26:38.457
No, our minister
was the Elvis.

26:38.459 --> 26:39.659
Wait a minute... right?

26:39.661 --> 26:41.696
The singers
were celebrities.

26:43.636 --> 26:48.744
Oh, and there is a jukebox
playing our favorite song.

26:48.746 --> 26:50.682
And we did 'shrooms.

26:52.554 --> 26:54.488
It was totally
a spur-of-the-moment thing.

26:54.490 --> 26:57.361
I just won the jackpot
on the slot machines.

26:57.363 --> 26:59.331
I was like,
why the hell not?

26:59.333 --> 27:01.504
I mean, we got
a giant check now.

27:01.506 --> 27:03.306
We can get a house.

27:03.308 --> 27:05.577
You know, we've been talking
about getting married.

27:05.579 --> 27:07.816
So you won a whole
bunch of money

27:07.818 --> 27:10.524
and decided to give
half of it to her.

27:12.928 --> 27:14.997
So we're going to Red Rock?

27:14.999 --> 27:17.969
Yeah, yeah, we hear
it's the best park in town.

27:17.971 --> 27:20.641
You realize
it's midnight, right?

27:20.643 --> 27:22.413
So?

27:23.549 --> 27:24.985
Your funeral.

28:07.003 --> 28:08.838
We're there.

28:08.840 --> 28:10.742
Huh?

28:10.744 --> 28:11.943
Oh, yeah.

28:13.582 --> 28:14.985
Come on.

28:17.824 --> 28:19.225
It's spooky.

28:24.236 --> 28:26.909
It's so hot out here.

28:31.985 --> 28:33.556
Yo.

28:35.024 --> 28:36.627
Hey, man. Here.

28:36.629 --> 28:38.730
- Fuck...
- Just wait here a minute.

28:38.732 --> 28:41.268
I got more where that came from,
all right?

28:41.270 --> 28:42.838
All right, yeah, fine.

28:42.840 --> 28:44.912
All right.

28:46.214 --> 28:47.815
Take our picture.

28:47.817 --> 28:50.787
Yeah. Wedding photos!

28:53.762 --> 28:55.798
Okay, here, let me set this up.
Let me set this up.

28:55.800 --> 28:58.838
Babysitting a couple
of tripping assholes.

28:58.840 --> 29:00.642
That's what she said.

29:00.644 --> 29:03.580
You're stroking
my stick, babe.

29:03.582 --> 29:06.019
Okay, okay, yeah, like a little
tepee or something.

29:06.021 --> 29:08.089
- Babe, you got it!
- Yeah, I am the man.

29:08.091 --> 29:10.961
Okay, don't move.
Don't move.

29:10.963 --> 29:13.768
I think...

29:13.770 --> 29:17.073
Done! Damn it. Fucking...

29:17.075 --> 29:19.848
- I had it. Okay, okay, okay.
- Babe, go...

29:25.091 --> 29:26.897
Yo.

29:28.198 --> 29:30.299
Hey, man,
sorry to bother you,

29:30.301 --> 29:34.845
but could you, like, take some
photos of us or something?

29:37.149 --> 29:38.784
Come on, man.
I'll give you more money.

29:38.786 --> 29:40.120
Yeah, all right.

29:40.122 --> 29:42.191
Yeah, come on.
I'm not being a dick.

29:48.740 --> 29:50.339
Okay...

29:50.341 --> 29:51.876
All right.

29:51.878 --> 29:53.680
- Okay...
- Shh!

29:53.682 --> 29:55.316
Don't shush me.

29:55.318 --> 29:58.691
Okay, okay, just wait
till we're in frame...

29:58.693 --> 30:01.194
Shh! Stop.

30:01.196 --> 30:02.698
Just wait till...
yeah, like that.

30:02.700 --> 30:04.100
Just push the button.

30:04.102 --> 30:07.741
Not yet! Okay...

30:21.204 --> 30:23.173
Hey, man.

30:23.175 --> 30:24.909
Whoa, wait...

30:24.911 --> 30:26.715
what are you doing?

30:37.036 --> 30:38.503
Kill 'em!

30:38.505 --> 30:40.406
Let's go to
the strip club.

30:40.408 --> 30:42.512
- Strip club!
- Yeah, I want to see some pussy.

30:42.514 --> 30:45.050
They took you out to the middle
of the desert at midnight.

30:45.052 --> 30:46.886
Here, take us
to a strip club.

30:46.888 --> 30:49.157
Come on, they pretty much
just bag and tag themselves.

30:49.159 --> 30:50.927
Just finish them off.

30:50.929 --> 30:52.799
You're like the only guy
we know out here.

30:52.801 --> 30:54.503
He could be our best man.

30:54.505 --> 30:56.774
<i>Yeah.</i>

31:33.950 --> 31:35.482
Dude, this isn't
our hotel.

31:35.484 --> 31:36.920
We're at...

31:36.922 --> 31:38.255
the Arizona Charlie.

31:38.257 --> 31:39.892
I am done with you.

31:39.894 --> 31:41.361
Get out of the car!

31:41.363 --> 31:43.933
Jesus. Get out, get out.

31:47.644 --> 31:49.545
Oh, goddamn it!

31:49.547 --> 31:52.016
Hey!

32:13.427 --> 32:14.962
Art.

32:14.964 --> 32:16.500
Hey.

32:16.502 --> 32:18.704
<i>Damn. I was expecting
your call earlier.</i>

32:18.706 --> 32:20.978
Yeah, I figured.

32:22.981 --> 32:25.684
Got the papers in front of you
right now, I just know it.

32:25.686 --> 32:30.025
No, actually,
I'm in the can, so...

32:30.027 --> 32:31.529
<i>Just give me the name
of the girl.</i>

32:31.531 --> 32:33.231
I can't tell you that.

32:33.233 --> 32:35.671
You owe me.

32:35.673 --> 32:38.042
<i>I saved you twice.</i>

32:38.044 --> 32:40.447
Just stop talking. Stop.

32:40.449 --> 32:43.654
If I tell you this information,
I could lose my fucking job.

32:43.656 --> 32:45.523
Never stopped you before.

32:45.525 --> 32:47.493
All right, asshole,
listen up.

32:47.495 --> 32:48.997
<i>Not repeatable.</i>

32:48.999 --> 32:51.035
I'm not writing a report.

32:51.037 --> 32:54.474
She's one of your
friend's girls.

32:54.476 --> 32:55.778
Whoa.

32:55.780 --> 32:57.648
He's got girls now?

33:02.126 --> 33:03.793
Who is it?

33:03.795 --> 33:05.700
Police.

33:08.470 --> 33:10.105
You got some ID?

33:10.107 --> 33:12.277
Just tell Reggie
that Art's here to see him.

33:14.215 --> 33:16.084
Thank you.

33:22.733 --> 33:24.802
Who the fuck are you?

33:24.804 --> 33:26.237
Art.

33:26.239 --> 33:27.707
Oh, you're Reggie's boy?

33:27.709 --> 33:31.449
Yeah. You think you can
go find him for me?

33:31.451 --> 33:34.792
You're a fucking cop?
Not rerouting shit?

33:38.632 --> 33:40.771
- Hello.
- Hi.

33:43.140 --> 33:45.243
Diamond, sweetheart,
it's not this kind of business.

33:45.245 --> 33:46.846
Come on, sweetheart.
Just chill out in the back.

33:46.848 --> 33:48.717
I'll be right back there.
Be right with you.

33:48.719 --> 33:50.788
Art, what the fuck
brings you here?

33:50.790 --> 33:52.724
Looks like the state
paid you pretty good.

33:52.726 --> 33:54.461
Oh, you think your settlement
paid for this?

33:54.463 --> 33:57.199
I'm expanding, man.
I got girls now.

33:57.201 --> 33:59.438
I'm sure they love to see how
you're spending their money.

33:59.440 --> 34:02.744
What? It's an escort service.
It's all aboveboard.

34:02.746 --> 34:05.851
My girls all pay
their taxes, right?

34:05.853 --> 34:07.353
What's the tax
on a blowjob?

34:07.355 --> 34:09.659
Hey, I don't owe you
jack shit, dude,

34:09.661 --> 34:11.661
and you don't have
anything on me.

34:11.664 --> 34:14.266
I told you everything I knew,
and you didn't want to hear it.

34:14.268 --> 34:16.505
So I'm not doing this
around and around with you.

34:16.507 --> 34:18.609
Listen, I know the girl
they found in the desert

34:18.610 --> 34:20.213
was one of yours.

34:20.215 --> 34:21.782
I'm just trying
to track down her killer.

34:21.784 --> 34:23.385
I-I was friends with...

34:23.387 --> 34:25.658
Britney, shut the fuck up!

34:25.659 --> 34:27.193
What are you afraid of?

34:27.195 --> 34:29.732
My girls don't talk
to cops.

34:29.734 --> 34:33.175
I'm trying to keep your girls
from getting killed, asshole.

34:33.943 --> 34:35.543
All right, fine.

34:35.545 --> 34:39.217
Pay the rate,
you get the time.

34:39.219 --> 34:40.688
Okay.

34:44.965 --> 34:46.431
Twenty bucks
ain't going to cut it.

34:46.433 --> 34:49.539
You think I'm a fucking tourist?

34:49.541 --> 34:52.243
Tell me you never turned
a $20 trick before.

34:52.245 --> 34:53.512
All right,
fuck you, then.

34:53.514 --> 34:55.583
All right, Jesus!

34:55.585 --> 34:57.020
Talk to him for 15 minutes.

34:57.022 --> 34:58.790
But don't give him
a blowjob, okay?

34:58.792 --> 35:00.396
He's a cop.

35:07.510 --> 35:09.380
All right.

35:11.718 --> 35:12.984
Tell me what you know.

35:12.986 --> 35:14.757
Uh...

35:16.027 --> 35:20.400
last I heard from her
was February 16th.

35:20.402 --> 35:23.507
We kept track
of each other like that.

35:23.509 --> 35:26.044
Amber only had one client
that night.

35:26.046 --> 35:30.554
It was 220 Western Avenue.

35:30.556 --> 35:33.426
She told me
it was a 20-minute job.

35:33.428 --> 35:36.866
She checked in with me
when she got there...

35:36.868 --> 35:38.873
<i>said it was
a family man's home.</i>

35:43.046 --> 35:45.519
Twenty minutes later,
she said she was leaving.

35:46.721 --> 35:48.525
She never came back.

35:51.096 --> 35:53.334
Time's up.

35:54.770 --> 35:56.308
All right.

35:58.745 --> 36:01.518
Listen, why don't you
do me a favor.

36:03.988 --> 36:05.890
If you think of anything,

36:05.892 --> 36:08.465
let me know, okay?

36:09.566 --> 36:10.937
Thank you.

36:14.977 --> 36:16.513
Reggie, good to see you again.

36:16.515 --> 36:18.716
I don't owe you shit.
Remember that.

36:18.718 --> 36:20.152
Okay.

36:20.154 --> 36:22.457
What are you going
to do about it, pussy?

36:22.459 --> 36:24.998
Get the fuck
out of here.

36:45.773 --> 36:48.576
Hi. Uh...

36:48.578 --> 36:49.945
...can I talk
to your husband?

36:49.947 --> 36:51.983
I'm sorry, he's at work.

36:51.985 --> 36:55.623
- Where does he work?
- Security, at the Palace.

36:55.625 --> 36:56.825
Is he a big guy?

36:56.827 --> 36:58.896
I guess so, yeah.

36:58.898 --> 37:00.098
Damn it.

37:00.100 --> 37:01.738
Is something wrong?

37:04.610 --> 37:06.046
Go back upstairs.

37:08.050 --> 37:11.288
Uh, no, nothing. Um...

37:11.290 --> 37:12.257
You know when
he'll be home?

37:12.259 --> 37:14.059
Probably around 8:00.

37:14.061 --> 37:16.197
Are you sure
everything's okay?

37:16.199 --> 37:18.570
I'll have to ask him that.

37:18.572 --> 37:21.173
- Is he all right?
- He's fine.

37:21.175 --> 37:23.012
What did you say
your name was?

37:23.014 --> 37:25.185
I didn't.

37:57.382 --> 37:59.284
What the hell
is that smell?

37:59.286 --> 38:01.990
It was that guy from Harrah's
I picked up.

38:01.992 --> 38:05.328
He was disgusting,
had dried puke on his face.

38:05.330 --> 38:08.135
Oh, come on.
Come on, it was you.

38:08.137 --> 38:09.938
No, I swear to God,

38:09.940 --> 38:11.808
the second he got in the car
the whole thing reeked.

38:20.093 --> 38:22.229
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

38:22.231 --> 38:24.300
Look at that one
over there.

38:24.302 --> 38:26.939
Where?

38:26.941 --> 38:30.714
Come on, the ho with the purse.

38:30.716 --> 38:34.020
I mean, she's not
all that bad... considering.

38:34.022 --> 38:35.322
Oh, yeah?

38:35.324 --> 38:37.329
You like what you see, huh?

38:38.732 --> 38:40.900
Come on, I'm not going
to pay for it.

38:40.902 --> 38:43.939
Hey, who said anything
about paying for it, huh?

38:43.941 --> 38:46.014
Nah...

38:47.482 --> 38:49.386
I'm working.

38:50.387 --> 38:51.922
What, you call this working?

38:51.924 --> 38:53.291
Huh?

38:53.293 --> 38:55.229
What are you,
nervous or something?

38:55.231 --> 38:56.898
I'm not nervous.

38:56.900 --> 38:59.805
I just don't want
to do it.

38:59.807 --> 39:01.174
What?

39:01.176 --> 39:03.277
Whoa, is it that time
of month again?

39:03.279 --> 39:05.920
Hmm? Huh, pussy?

39:16.439 --> 39:19.812
What the fuck, man?

39:19.814 --> 39:21.782
What are you doing
in my driveway?

39:21.784 --> 39:24.320
Why don't you tell me
where you were on February 16th?

39:24.322 --> 39:26.391
Then I'll get out
of your driveway.

39:26.393 --> 39:29.464
George, is everything okay?

39:29.466 --> 39:31.300
Everything's fine.

39:31.302 --> 39:33.271
I'm just going to have a quick
conversation with this man

39:33.273 --> 39:35.108
and have him go
on his way.

39:35.110 --> 39:37.346
You can call the police.
Tell him we have a trespasser.

39:37.348 --> 39:39.384
I am the police.

39:39.386 --> 39:40.987
Vegas PD.

39:40.989 --> 39:43.929
Just go inside
and close the door, honey.

39:48.170 --> 39:50.105
You have a badge?

39:50.107 --> 39:53.412
Nope. All I want to know is
what happened on February 16th.

39:53.414 --> 39:55.115
How the fuck would I know?

39:55.117 --> 39:58.187
Drinking, bowling.
Drifting, maybe.

39:58.189 --> 39:59.489
Yeah? How about a prostitute?

39:59.491 --> 40:03.200
Listen, you fuck,
I know she was here.

40:05.037 --> 40:07.073
- Why'd you kill her?
- Kill her?

40:07.075 --> 40:10.415
I didn't kill her.
I only fucked her.

40:11.884 --> 40:15.557
Get back in the fucking house,
woman.

40:15.559 --> 40:18.294
Get back in the house!
What happened?

40:18.296 --> 40:20.231
I put her in a car
I sent her home.

40:20.233 --> 40:21.903
Who called the car, you or her?

40:21.905 --> 40:24.206
- I did.
- Did you see the driver's face?

40:24.208 --> 40:25.879
No.

40:27.314 --> 40:29.316
Did he text you
when he arrived?

40:29.318 --> 40:30.519
I don't know!

40:30.521 --> 40:31.656
Then check
your fucking phone!

40:31.658 --> 40:33.494
Okay!

40:39.272 --> 40:40.940
I got it, yeah.

40:40.942 --> 40:42.544
What's his fucking number?

40:42.546 --> 40:45.452
702-817...

40:52.967 --> 40:56.437
I'm sorry, ma'am.
Just... homicide investigation.

40:56.439 --> 40:59.243
I just had to ask him
a couple questions.

40:59.245 --> 41:00.714
I...

41:00.716 --> 41:03.317
I got the wrong guy.

41:03.319 --> 41:05.421
I'm sorry.

41:05.423 --> 41:07.161
Sorry.

41:27.535 --> 41:30.272
No, not anymore.

41:31.810 --> 41:33.348
Not doing it...

41:36.721 --> 41:39.125
No, no...

41:40.126 --> 41:41.697
I am fine.

41:43.466 --> 41:45.237
I am in control.

41:46.373 --> 41:48.775
I am in control.

41:48.777 --> 41:51.615
<i>I am in control.</i>

41:51.617 --> 41:54.189
<i>I am in control.</i>

42:21.777 --> 42:23.377
Detective Hutchins.

42:23.379 --> 42:24.715
<i>Hey, buddy, listen.</i>

42:24.717 --> 42:26.183
<i>It's me again.</i>

42:26.185 --> 42:28.321
I got one last favor
to ask you.

42:28.323 --> 42:31.694
And I told you to call other
people when you need favors.

42:31.696 --> 42:35.702
I got a real lead
on the dead escort.

42:35.704 --> 42:38.310
<i>The night before she was
murdered she was out on a call.</i>

42:39.880 --> 42:43.450
The address
was 220 Western Avenue.

42:43.452 --> 42:45.658
You think the date did it.

42:48.630 --> 42:50.365
No, I don't.

42:50.367 --> 42:52.202
<i>Well,
then what's going on, Art?</i>

42:52.204 --> 42:54.273
<i>Talk to me.
What's happening?</i>

42:54.275 --> 42:57.314
Sorry, I shouldn't have...
I shouldn't have bothered you.

43:11.544 --> 43:14.280
<i>Detective Art
Matthews calling for Henry Falcon.</i>

43:14.282 --> 43:15.749
<i>I have some
questions for you</i>

43:15.751 --> 43:17.486
<i>regarding a homicide
investigation.</i>

43:17.488 --> 43:18.789
- Fuck!
- <i>Give me a call back</i>

43:18.791 --> 43:22.399
<i>at 702-445-0318.</i>

43:24.035 --> 43:25.937
Fuck. He knows.

43:25.939 --> 43:29.346
If he knew, he would have
arrested you already.

43:30.414 --> 43:31.881
You fucking killed her.

43:31.883 --> 43:35.225
I just did what
you wanted me to do.

43:37.929 --> 43:41.003
Yeah, but I don't
do that shit.

43:55.565 --> 43:56.765
Oh.

43:56.767 --> 43:58.805
He had another wife.

44:01.676 --> 44:04.379
And look, her address.

44:04.381 --> 44:10.124
3126 Rainbow Ave.

44:10.126 --> 44:12.897
No, no, no.
He's already looking for us.

44:12.899 --> 44:15.067
It's either him or us.

44:15.069 --> 44:18.007
Then why don't you want
to kill him, you dumb fuck?

44:18.009 --> 44:19.744
Goddamn.

44:28.630 --> 44:31.400
I'm disappointed.
In the past week,

44:31.402 --> 44:34.776
<i>I haven't seen one single
constructive thing you've done.</i>

44:36.747 --> 44:38.716
You're obsessed
with your wife's killer.

44:38.718 --> 44:40.418
You're off the force

44:40.420 --> 44:42.692
because we're trying
to get you off the case.

44:45.029 --> 44:46.697
You asked me for the meeting.

44:46.699 --> 44:48.668
What did you think
I was going to say?

44:48.670 --> 44:49.970
You recorded the videos.

44:49.972 --> 44:52.443
You could have lied to me.

44:52.445 --> 44:53.949
Look!

44:55.552 --> 44:56.988
Here I am at the park.

44:58.123 --> 44:59.794
Here I am at the bookstore.

45:02.933 --> 45:04.804
Here I am at the theater.

45:07.541 --> 45:10.044
Henry, this is Detective
Matthews calling again.

45:10.046 --> 45:12.553
I still haven't
heard back from you.

45:15.658 --> 45:17.494
Art, you're delusional.

45:27.248 --> 45:29.653
She's coming.

45:30.787 --> 45:32.659
I said leave me alone.

45:39.237 --> 45:41.108
Knock-knock.

45:43.212 --> 45:44.883
Hi. May I get a ride?

45:46.184 --> 45:48.121
You're supposed to pay
with your phone.

45:48.123 --> 45:49.557
I know. I know.

45:49.559 --> 45:51.259
My phone is dead.

45:51.261 --> 45:53.898
You should have tipped
last time.

45:53.900 --> 45:55.569
Yeah, I know.

45:55.571 --> 45:57.305
But I'll make it up
to you.

45:57.307 --> 45:58.976
How?

45:58.978 --> 46:00.277
Take me to Flamingo

46:00.279 --> 46:02.117
and we can talk about it
on the way.

46:03.620 --> 46:04.820
Yeah.

46:04.822 --> 46:06.356
We'll work something out.

46:06.358 --> 46:08.029
Great.

46:08.997 --> 46:10.799
Thank you.

46:10.801 --> 46:13.203
It has been the worst day.

46:13.205 --> 46:15.643
Sorry to hear that.

46:15.645 --> 46:16.945
Yeah.

46:16.947 --> 46:18.782
Yeah, so, like,
my baby's sick,

46:18.784 --> 46:21.988
and then now
her babysitter's sick,

46:21.990 --> 46:25.963
so she's with my sister
for a little.

46:25.965 --> 46:28.233
<i>And, like, the hospital bills.
Oh, my God, the hospital bills.</i>

46:28.235 --> 46:30.005
<i>They're killing me.</i>

46:30.007 --> 46:31.942
<i>Sir, there's nothing I can do.</i>

46:31.944 --> 46:34.814
Please just give me
one more day.

46:34.816 --> 46:37.052
I'm waiting for a check
to get here.

46:37.054 --> 46:38.722
<i>Sir, we have a strict policy.</i>

46:38.724 --> 46:40.125
You know how long
I've been staying here?

46:40.127 --> 46:42.129
I must have
a free night by now.

46:42.131 --> 46:44.166
<i>I'm checking
your invoice, sir.</i>

46:44.168 --> 46:45.869
God.

46:51.850 --> 46:53.819
Listen,

46:53.821 --> 46:55.220
I'm hanging up now.

46:55.222 --> 46:57.863
I'll bring a credit card by
later, okay?

47:05.477 --> 47:09.415
<i>And so he's trying
to get my sister to give her to him,</i>

47:09.417 --> 47:13.694
<i>and my sister
is such a bitch.</i>

47:19.038 --> 47:21.778
Yeah, it's pretty tough.

47:24.915 --> 47:29.523
And so my boyfriend
said he'll marry me,

47:29.525 --> 47:32.900
then the state
can't take my baby.

47:38.243 --> 47:41.116
Thank you so much
for the ride.

47:42.084 --> 47:43.822
Um...

47:46.192 --> 47:48.362
we had a deal.

47:56.278 --> 47:58.581
I'm sorry,
I can get you the next time.

47:59.952 --> 48:02.454
Yeah, you've said that before.

48:02.456 --> 48:04.928
I really mean it.

48:04.930 --> 48:08.099
No, I think you can
pay me right now.

48:08.101 --> 48:09.871
I told you,
I don't have any money.

48:09.873 --> 48:11.439
My last client
robbed me.

48:11.441 --> 48:14.847
You think I'm going to believe
a fucking whore?

48:14.849 --> 48:16.550
Honestly, I... I don't.

48:16.552 --> 48:19.223
Mm-hmm.

48:19.225 --> 48:22.262
Who do you think I am? You can't
just walk over me like that.

48:22.264 --> 48:24.533
Mm-mm.

48:24.535 --> 48:27.037
Listen, I have
somewhere to be.

48:27.039 --> 48:28.440
Oh, yeah?

48:28.442 --> 48:30.110
- Yeah, I have a job.
- Oh, you have a job?

48:30.112 --> 48:33.019
I think you need to pay
for this job right here.

48:39.498 --> 48:42.538
I'll make it up to you.

48:44.275 --> 48:46.442
We'll just find
someplace quiet.

48:46.444 --> 48:48.147
I have a room
at the Flamingo.

48:48.149 --> 48:50.150
It's pretty quiet.

48:50.152 --> 48:52.154
You think
I'm just a mark?

48:54.160 --> 48:56.032
Uh-uh.

48:57.100 --> 48:59.036
Okay, all right,
I'm sorry.

48:59.038 --> 49:01.140
I should have been
honest with you.

49:01.142 --> 49:04.278
Listen, I've been doing this
since I was 13.

49:04.280 --> 49:06.984
Do you have any idea
how it is to sell your body?

49:06.986 --> 49:10.361
You're just an actress who
couldn't cut it in Hollywood.

49:14.001 --> 49:15.467
I got you now.

49:15.469 --> 49:18.173
Where are you going?

49:18.175 --> 49:19.610
Oh...

49:19.612 --> 49:22.418
I'm just looking
for someplace quiet.

49:25.222 --> 49:28.129
It's fine, it's fine.
Not yet, not yet.

49:31.135 --> 49:32.536
Please just pull
the car over,

49:32.538 --> 49:34.710
and I'll give you
whatever you want.

49:36.779 --> 49:40.153
- You know you want me.
- Stop it. Stop it.

49:42.056 --> 49:44.562
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

49:46.031 --> 49:49.235
Stop it. It's a lie.
It's a lie.

49:49.237 --> 49:51.075
It's a lie.

50:05.102 --> 50:07.672
- I'll call the police.
- Oh, well, that's convenient.

50:07.674 --> 50:09.409
Your phone works.

50:10.815 --> 50:12.247
I guess you should have
just paid me,

50:12.249 --> 50:15.121
then we wouldn't be here.

50:15.123 --> 50:17.324
Go ahead, call them.

50:17.326 --> 50:19.261
Hey, I'm the whore

50:19.263 --> 50:21.736
that works over
by the Flamingo!

50:33.192 --> 50:34.459
Fight me like that, huh?

50:34.461 --> 50:36.430
Oh, yeah,
give me a little fight.

50:36.432 --> 50:38.200
Give me a little fight!

50:39.706 --> 50:41.541
Hey, remember
what you said?

50:41.543 --> 50:45.213
Do you? You said that
you couldn't afford it.

50:45.215 --> 50:46.584
You did, you did.

50:46.586 --> 50:48.353
How about this, huh?
How about this?

50:48.355 --> 50:50.692
I'm going to look
in that little purse of yours,

50:50.694 --> 50:54.600
and if we find less than...
200 bucks, huh?

50:54.602 --> 50:56.336
How about 200 bucks?

50:56.338 --> 50:58.707
We'll say you're not lying,
you fucking whore.

50:58.709 --> 51:00.177
How about that, huh?

51:00.179 --> 51:02.515
Yeah.

51:02.517 --> 51:04.586
Fucking...

51:04.588 --> 51:06.190
fucking stay there.

51:06.192 --> 51:08.393
Fucking stay still.

51:08.395 --> 51:11.233
Ooh. Huh?

51:11.235 --> 51:13.708
That's a nice little purse
you got here.

51:16.244 --> 51:17.713
What's this?

51:17.715 --> 51:19.316
Money for my baby.

51:19.318 --> 51:20.685
It's for your baby?

51:20.687 --> 51:23.256
That's a lot of money.
Oh, goddamn it!

51:23.258 --> 51:25.327
If I only had
fucking kids,

51:25.329 --> 51:30.470
you fucking goddamn whore.

52:15.630 --> 52:17.835
Why did you do it?

52:19.971 --> 52:21.709
Oh, why?

53:07.167 --> 53:08.871
Oh, fuck.

53:11.174 --> 53:13.911
Oh, God, why'd you kill her?
Fuck.

53:13.913 --> 53:15.815
Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.

53:15.817 --> 53:18.556
God, you're going
to get us caught.

53:24.601 --> 53:26.102
How does...

53:26.104 --> 53:27.976
how does that happen?

53:47.246 --> 53:48.817
It's the same number.

53:50.821 --> 53:52.525
Fuck.

53:56.230 --> 53:58.834
Goddamn.

53:58.836 --> 54:00.574
Fuck!

54:01.910 --> 54:04.180
It's a detective.

54:05.148 --> 54:06.851
What's he want?

54:06.853 --> 54:08.253
What's he know?

54:13.164 --> 54:14.700
You fucking killed her.

54:14.702 --> 54:16.573
I just did
what you wanted...

54:21.582 --> 54:23.185
My neck...

55:11.882 --> 55:13.884
Reggie!

55:24.273 --> 55:25.874
Fuck, you again?

55:25.876 --> 55:28.181
- Is Britney here?
- Who?

55:29.719 --> 55:32.722
It's all right.
Just the crazy cop.

55:32.724 --> 55:35.797
Britney, the girl that I talked
to the last time I was here.

55:36.865 --> 55:38.466
Oh, yeah. Uh-huh.

55:38.468 --> 55:40.938
Well, she didn't show up
for work yesterday.

55:40.940 --> 55:42.909
Or today.

55:42.911 --> 55:45.379
You see, the girls make
their own schedules.

55:45.381 --> 55:47.218
And I got a policy
around here

55:47.220 --> 55:49.889
that if they're not making
me money, then, you know,

55:49.891 --> 55:51.359
not my responsibility.

55:51.361 --> 55:54.034
Yeah, well,
I think she's dead.

55:57.508 --> 56:00.312
You telling me I got two dead
girls on my hands now?

56:02.215 --> 56:04.919
If I was a cop,
motherfucker,

56:04.921 --> 56:08.159
I'd pin you for the link
between those two.

56:08.161 --> 56:10.299
That's all I got to say.

56:11.401 --> 56:13.571
Reggie, come on, man.
Talk to me.

56:13.573 --> 56:14.972
Talk to me.

56:14.974 --> 56:16.442
Talk to me!

56:16.444 --> 56:18.379
Get rid of him.

56:18.381 --> 56:20.117
Get the fuck out of here.

56:20.119 --> 56:21.519
- Fuck you, man!
- Fuck you, pig!

56:21.521 --> 56:24.762
- Open the fucking door!
- Fuck you!

57:09.450 --> 57:11.084
Henry...

57:11.086 --> 57:13.188
I'm going to give you
one more chance.

57:13.190 --> 57:16.630
Meet me tomorrow at 3:00 p.m.
at the Desert Breeze Inn.

57:16.632 --> 57:20.372
I'll be waiting on the bench
at the top of the south circle.

57:22.476 --> 57:24.549
Be there, motherfucker.

57:55.409 --> 57:58.345
It's an unusual meeting point,
Detective.

57:58.347 --> 57:59.615
Yeah.

57:59.617 --> 58:01.686
You questioned
for murder often?

58:01.688 --> 58:04.559
I watch a lot of movies.

58:04.561 --> 58:05.795
So why'd you come?

58:05.797 --> 58:08.065
I've got nothing
to hide from you.

58:08.067 --> 58:09.703
Well, that's good.

58:09.705 --> 58:12.677
Can you tell me what happened
on February 16th?

58:14.815 --> 58:17.619
No. No, I can't.

58:17.621 --> 58:20.157
I have no fucking clue
what day that was.

58:20.159 --> 58:21.491
Let me refresh your memory.

58:21.493 --> 58:23.495
Picked up a whore
at 220 Western Avenue.

58:23.497 --> 58:26.469
Remember that?

58:26.471 --> 58:28.673
I drive a lot of whores
from point A to point B.

58:28.675 --> 58:32.147
Yeah, well, this particular one
didn't make it to point B.

58:32.149 --> 58:33.651
Really?

58:33.653 --> 58:36.690
What'd you do with her?

58:36.692 --> 58:39.328
I can't answer for where you
think she was supposed to be.

58:39.330 --> 58:41.299
All right?

58:41.301 --> 58:43.737
Can say I dropped her off where
she asked to be dropped off.

58:43.739 --> 58:46.610
But a lot of whores get sick
of the life, you know?

58:46.612 --> 58:48.178
Run away.

58:48.180 --> 58:49.716
Oh, is that right?

58:49.718 --> 58:51.589
They found her buried
in the desert.

58:53.125 --> 58:54.826
That's unfortunate
for her.

58:54.828 --> 58:56.361
Yeah, well,
I got a witness who says

58:56.363 --> 58:58.502
you were the last person
seen with her.

59:00.371 --> 59:03.376
That guy says you were
the last one seen with me.

59:03.378 --> 59:05.412
Look, I don't keep
paperwork

59:05.414 --> 59:07.450
on where I pick up
and drop off fares, all right?

59:07.452 --> 59:10.828
So if that's all you got,
I got better things to do.

59:18.375 --> 59:19.712
Helen.

59:26.256 --> 59:28.359
So you remember Helen.

59:28.361 --> 59:30.601
You stabbed her to death
in my kitchen.

01:00:03.832 --> 01:00:06.769
He knows everything,
you fuck!

01:00:06.771 --> 01:00:08.974
He doesn't have anything.
If he knew something,

01:00:08.976 --> 01:00:11.411
he wouldn't be meeting us
in a park.

01:00:11.413 --> 01:00:12.882
He's meeting you in a park

01:00:12.884 --> 01:00:16.723
because he's going
to fucking kill you.

01:00:16.725 --> 01:00:18.894
I told you, he doesn't need
evidence, he doesn't need proof.

01:00:18.896 --> 01:00:20.731
He just wanted to know
that you killed her

01:00:20.733 --> 01:00:23.971
and you fucking gave it
right to him.

01:00:23.973 --> 01:00:25.573
Just let me drive.

01:00:25.575 --> 01:00:27.644
You're going to kill a cop.

01:00:27.646 --> 01:00:31.521
<i>You have to do it carefully.
It's not like killing a whore.</i>

01:01:00.011 --> 01:01:04.384
This is not the time
to hide, Henry.

01:01:04.386 --> 01:01:08.627
What are you talking about?
Now is the perfect time to hide.

01:01:08.629 --> 01:01:10.964
You're going to run away
your whole life.

01:01:10.966 --> 01:01:13.970
Come on, stand up.
Be a man about it.

01:01:13.972 --> 01:01:15.808
Yeah, I'm going to stand up

01:01:15.810 --> 01:01:17.911
and I'm going to get
a bullet for it.

01:01:17.913 --> 01:01:21.588
That's why you
got to hit him first.

01:01:39.055 --> 01:01:40.994
Mac.

01:01:49.978 --> 01:01:52.682
What?

01:01:52.684 --> 01:01:55.122
I need you to run
some plates for me.

01:01:59.763 --> 01:02:01.231
Arizona.

01:02:01.233 --> 01:02:03.569
Copper can't run
his own plates?

01:02:03.571 --> 01:02:05.943
I need it off the books.

01:02:08.848 --> 01:02:10.249
Give me a couple hours.

01:02:10.251 --> 01:02:11.619
Thanks.

01:02:11.621 --> 01:02:12.988
For all I know,

01:02:12.990 --> 01:02:15.761
the whole department
is looking for me.

01:02:15.763 --> 01:02:17.968
Use your head.

01:02:19.036 --> 01:02:20.537
<i>Did you see a badge?</i>

01:02:20.539 --> 01:02:23.579
Did you see backup?
Did he have a gun?

01:02:26.284 --> 01:02:27.887
He's gone rogue, Henry.

01:02:56.243 --> 01:02:57.978
Hello?

01:02:57.980 --> 01:03:00.350
<i>I got the 411
on your plates.</i>

01:03:00.352 --> 01:03:03.121
- Mm-hmm?
- <i>I got a name.</i>

01:03:03.123 --> 01:03:05.058
<i>Henry Falcon.</i>

01:03:05.060 --> 01:03:07.133
I knew that already.

01:03:08.868 --> 01:03:11.138
<i>But he put down
a fake address.</i>

01:03:11.140 --> 01:03:14.076
What do you mean
it's a fake address?

01:03:14.078 --> 01:03:16.317
<i>It's a vacant lot
in Phoenix.</i>

01:03:17.819 --> 01:03:19.955
So how am I supposed
to find this guy?

01:03:19.957 --> 01:03:21.825
<i>Not my problem.</i>

01:03:21.827 --> 01:03:24.931
Fuck you, Mac!

01:03:51.220 --> 01:03:53.291
I got it.

01:03:54.961 --> 01:03:56.699
Yeah, I got it.

01:04:30.566 --> 01:04:32.968
Come on, it's green, asshole.
Go!

01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:36.477
It's green, asshole.

01:05:17.058 --> 01:05:19.360
Hey!

01:05:19.362 --> 01:05:21.902
Don't get in that car!

01:05:30.952 --> 01:05:33.354
Who's your date?
The big, bad wolf?

01:05:33.356 --> 01:05:35.997
Of course.
I even brought a basket.

01:05:37.934 --> 01:05:39.501
You know, to be honest,
I almost missed you.

01:05:39.503 --> 01:05:41.237
I thought we were looking
for a blonde.

01:05:41.239 --> 01:05:44.313
Oh, yeah, sorry.
That's a really old picture.

01:05:45.683 --> 01:05:48.217
Don't feel bad.
It works for you.

01:05:48.219 --> 01:05:49.454
Thanks.

01:05:51.159 --> 01:05:52.963
Fuck!

01:06:02.148 --> 01:06:04.117
You wanted my account
of what happened

01:06:04.119 --> 01:06:05.686
on the night that Helen
was murdered.

01:06:11.367 --> 01:06:13.469
You knew I was undercover,

01:06:13.471 --> 01:06:17.179
<i>and that somebody leaked
my identity.</i>

01:06:21.419 --> 01:06:23.655
When I got home,
the door was wide open.

01:06:23.657 --> 01:06:27.131
<i>Helen was inside and she had
been stabbed to death.</i>

01:06:31.306 --> 01:06:33.108
No prints.

01:06:33.110 --> 01:06:36.149
<i>No forced entry.</i>

01:06:38.522 --> 01:06:42.660
I'm no longer on active duty,
because I was a suspect.

01:06:42.662 --> 01:06:44.698
They think that I could have...

01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:46.234
slit my wife's throat?

01:06:46.236 --> 01:06:49.143
Stabbed her repeatedly?

01:06:56.490 --> 01:06:58.596
<i>I was betrayed.</i>

01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:04.103
So as much as red
is your color,

01:07:04.105 --> 01:07:06.541
what's going on
with the cape?

01:07:06.543 --> 01:07:08.414
It's for a costume party.

01:07:09.616 --> 01:07:11.521
You party a lot?

01:07:12.522 --> 01:07:14.325
Little more than I used to.

01:07:16.730 --> 01:07:18.633
Can I be honest
with you?

01:07:18.635 --> 01:07:20.335
Oh, yeah, of course.

01:07:20.337 --> 01:07:21.806
I hate this.

01:07:23.276 --> 01:07:24.711
It's going to be
people from high school,

01:07:24.713 --> 01:07:27.219
and I hate everyone
from high school.

01:07:28.855 --> 01:07:31.528
Oh, yeah? Come on,
you got to tell me why.

01:07:33.330 --> 01:07:35.499
My friends...
I don't know.

01:07:35.501 --> 01:07:37.704
They were always
doing something.

01:07:37.706 --> 01:07:41.343
Just felt like
I didn't fit in.

01:07:41.345 --> 01:07:43.247
I guess I still
don't fit in.

01:07:43.249 --> 01:07:45.255
They're all doing
big stuff, and...

01:07:46.824 --> 01:07:49.798
and I don't do anything
by myself.

01:07:51.333 --> 01:07:52.768
Yeah, I get it.

01:07:52.770 --> 01:07:54.236
Thanks.

01:07:54.238 --> 01:07:55.874
No, no.

01:07:55.876 --> 01:07:57.847
I get it.

01:08:00.317 --> 01:08:02.353
I don't know. I guess I just
feel a little ridiculous.

01:08:02.355 --> 01:08:04.357
You know, I mean, I haven't
seen them in a few years,

01:08:04.359 --> 01:08:07.262
and here I am
for a costume party.

01:08:07.264 --> 01:08:09.501
Well, you're dressed
to the nines.

01:08:09.503 --> 01:08:11.471
Hey, go big
or go home, right?

01:08:13.009 --> 01:08:15.379
You're not going home.

01:08:16.818 --> 01:08:19.486
Hey, wait,
this isn't my stop.

01:08:19.488 --> 01:08:20.890
No.

01:08:20.892 --> 01:08:22.426
No, this is my stop.

01:08:22.428 --> 01:08:24.330
The "check engine" light's on.

01:08:24.332 --> 01:08:25.933
Just give me a minute.
I'll get it fixed.

01:08:25.935 --> 01:08:27.703
Oh, it's okay.
I can just call another car.

01:08:27.705 --> 01:08:29.611
Don't. Put the...

01:08:30.645 --> 01:08:33.314
put the phone down.

01:08:33.316 --> 01:08:34.517
Look, I'll handle it.

01:08:34.519 --> 01:08:36.423
Just give me a minute,
all right?

01:08:39.563 --> 01:08:41.298
Look, I really have to go.

01:08:43.002 --> 01:08:46.041
I said don't use the phone!

01:08:46.042 --> 01:08:48.682
But you didn't do anything.
Get out!

01:08:51.821 --> 01:08:53.555
What big eyes you have.

01:08:53.557 --> 01:08:56.328
You remember what you told me?

01:08:56.330 --> 01:08:57.897
- Please! Please!
- You remember what you told me?

01:08:57.899 --> 01:08:59.501
That you can't do anything
on your own.

01:08:59.502 --> 01:09:02.607
That you can't do
anything on your own, huh?

01:09:02.609 --> 01:09:03.943
Remember that?

01:09:03.944 --> 01:09:05.779
You remember that, huh?

01:09:05.782 --> 01:09:06.982
Come here.

01:09:06.984 --> 01:09:08.451
Oh, hey.

01:09:08.453 --> 01:09:09.654
Hey, no, no, come on.

01:09:09.656 --> 01:09:10.923
Be quiet,
Little Riding Hood.

01:09:10.925 --> 01:09:13.461
No one can hear you
scream out here.

01:09:13.462 --> 01:09:15.566
Oh, please!

01:11:09.361 --> 01:11:11.932
Help. Help me.

01:11:11.934 --> 01:11:14.605
Goddamn!

01:11:16.009 --> 01:11:18.377
I thought you got rid of her
last night!

01:11:18.379 --> 01:11:20.048
No.

01:11:20.050 --> 01:11:22.055
I saved her.

01:11:23.155 --> 01:11:24.790
You saved her?

01:11:24.792 --> 01:11:27.766
You can't do that!

01:11:29.167 --> 01:11:31.371
Yes, I can.

01:11:31.373 --> 01:11:33.374
And tonight...

01:11:33.376 --> 01:11:35.882
Oh, Henry, tonight...

01:11:37.017 --> 01:11:38.785
we'll be rid of Art.

01:11:42.996 --> 01:11:45.265
What are you going to do?

01:11:47.672 --> 01:11:50.274
Don't... don't look at me like...
Don't do that.

01:11:54.017 --> 01:11:56.789
Oh, I don't want
to do this anymore.

01:11:56.791 --> 01:12:00.398
I don't want to do this anymore.
Just stop.

01:12:02.234 --> 01:12:04.139
Just go away.

01:12:05.742 --> 01:12:08.179
Please, just go away.

01:12:13.089 --> 01:12:15.394
Calm down, Henry.

01:12:16.897 --> 01:12:18.499
You're going
to be all right.

01:12:21.773 --> 01:12:24.445
We're going to have ourselves...

01:12:25.815 --> 01:12:27.385
<i>a good old time.</i>

01:12:33.262 --> 01:12:35.000
Now what?

01:12:44.018 --> 01:12:45.756
Shit.

01:12:57.011 --> 01:12:58.444
Debbie?

01:12:58.446 --> 01:13:01.082
<i>Art, I saw you taking photos.</i>

01:13:01.084 --> 01:13:03.021
Debbie, that wasn't me.

01:13:03.023 --> 01:13:06.260
- <i>I fucking saw you.</i>
- I... listen, Debbie...

01:13:06.262 --> 01:13:09.099
- <i>I'm calling the police.</i>
- Yes, call the police.

01:13:09.101 --> 01:13:12.906
Just... listen, lock the door
and don't open it for anybody,

01:13:12.908 --> 01:13:14.242
no matter what.
I'll...

01:13:14.244 --> 01:13:15.948
Debbie?

01:13:17.350 --> 01:13:18.922
Fuck!

01:13:40.565 --> 01:13:42.468
Debbie?

01:14:08.987 --> 01:14:10.990
Get the fuck
away from me.

01:14:10.992 --> 01:14:13.127
It's okay.
It's just me.

01:14:13.129 --> 01:14:16.166
Yeah, you get away from me.

01:14:16.168 --> 01:14:17.502
I was worried about you.

01:14:17.504 --> 01:14:19.106
I've already called
the police.

01:14:19.108 --> 01:14:20.342
They're on their way.

01:14:20.344 --> 01:14:21.744
Your door was open,

01:14:21.746 --> 01:14:24.282
and I just... I wanted
to check on you.

01:14:24.284 --> 01:14:27.525
Those photos
were texted to me.

01:14:29.628 --> 01:14:32.700
I just wanted to make sure
you were okay.

01:14:32.702 --> 01:14:34.306
Sorry.

01:14:35.339 --> 01:14:37.277
Sorry.

01:14:43.790 --> 01:14:48.163
The door was open.
Why was your door open?

01:14:48.165 --> 01:14:50.036
It wasn't open.

01:14:51.471 --> 01:14:54.109
Henry?

01:14:54.111 --> 01:14:55.344
- Henry!
- There's nobody here.

01:14:55.346 --> 01:14:57.049
- Just go.
- Show your face!

01:14:57.051 --> 01:14:58.819
Go!

01:14:58.821 --> 01:15:01.322
I know he's here.

01:15:01.324 --> 01:15:04.098
Oh, God.

01:15:05.467 --> 01:15:08.273
Please, just go.

01:15:27.611 --> 01:15:30.214
<i>This is going to be
my last journal entry.</i>

01:15:30.216 --> 01:15:34.191
I spent three years
searching for my wife's killer.

01:15:35.327 --> 01:15:36.798
And I found him.

01:15:39.536 --> 01:15:41.306
He's a driver.

01:15:42.541 --> 01:15:44.142
His name is Henry Falcon.

01:15:44.144 --> 01:15:46.815
He's killed at least
three other women

01:15:46.817 --> 01:15:49.452
since Helen's death.

01:15:55.867 --> 01:15:57.536
In case we never
see each other again,

01:15:57.538 --> 01:16:00.343
I just wanted you to know...

01:16:01.379 --> 01:16:03.383
that I found peace.

01:16:32.708 --> 01:16:34.276
Detective Hutchins.

01:16:34.278 --> 01:16:35.980
<i>This is Nathan Jones.</i>

01:16:35.982 --> 01:16:40.421
What was Art's identity
when he was working undercover?

01:16:40.423 --> 01:16:41.594
Henry Falcon.

01:16:42.962 --> 01:16:45.267
I'll take it from here.

01:16:57.423 --> 01:16:59.458
Get the fuck
away from me.

01:16:59.460 --> 01:17:01.296
It's okay.

01:17:01.298 --> 01:17:03.437
It's me.
