OF THEMSELVES.

09:57.431 --> 09:59.266
- PLEASE.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.892
YOU'LL BE RUNNING AFTER THEM
WHEN THEY'RE 35 YEARS OLD.

10:00.892 --> 10:03.270
- AT LEAST ONE PARENT WILL.

10:03.270 --> 10:06.690
- GET OUT.
- OH, MY PLEASURE.

10:06.690 --> 10:08.818
HERE'S YOUR LAST STUPID BOX.

10:08.818 --> 10:10.820
[glass breaks]
- WHAT THE HELL ARE YOU DOING?

10:10.820 --> 10:12.112
GO. THIS IS GOING NOWHERE.

10:12.112 --> 10:13.405
- YEAH, I WAS JUST LEAVING.

10:13.405 --> 10:14.740
- YEAH,
AFTER I TOLD YOU TO LEAVE.

10:14.740 --> 10:16.199
- NO, NO, NO,
I WAS THINKING ABOUT IT

10:16.199 --> 10:18.828
WAY BEFORE YOU SAID ANYTHING!

10:18.828 --> 10:19.953
[glass breaks]

10:28.628 --> 10:30.380
- IS THAT MY SHIRT?

10:30.380 --> 10:32.549
- OH.

10:32.549 --> 10:35.135
I CAN GIVE IT BACK.

10:35.135 --> 10:37.971
I WAS JUST LOOKING FOR SOMETHING
TO WEAR, AND THERE WAS A MESS,

10:37.971 --> 10:40.432
SO I STARTED TO STRAIGHTEN UP.

10:40.432 --> 10:42.392
I ORGANIZE WHEN I'M NERVOUS.

10:42.392 --> 10:44.186
- I COOK.

10:49.149 --> 10:50.942
EAT.

10:57.741 --> 11:00.160

11:00.160 --> 11:03.831
- YEAH, ME EITHER.

11:03.831 --> 11:07.626
- I'M SORRY.

11:07.626 --> 11:09.169
- I THOUGHT WE'D MAKE IT
AT LEAST A YEAR

11:09.169 --> 11:10.880
BEFORE WE HIT OUR FIRST BUMP.

11:10.880 --> 11:13.006
- YEAH.

11:13.006 --> 11:15.759
- IF WE WERE JUST DATING, IT'D
BE EASY TO WALK AWAY, BUT...

11:19.930 --> 11:21.598
WHY'D YOU SLEEP WITH HIM?

11:24.392 --> 11:26.937
- IT JUST HAPPENED.

11:26.937 --> 11:30.816
WE WERE...UNFINISHED.

11:30.816 --> 11:32.651
- IS IT STILL UNFINISHED?

11:50.710 --> 11:52.838
I WANT TO MEET HIM.

11:52.838 --> 11:54.631
- WHAT?

11:54.631 --> 11:57.926
- YEAH, JIMMY, OR STEVE,
WHATEVER THE HELL HIS NAME IS.

11:57.926 --> 12:01.889
- WHY?
- JUST TALK, SORT THINGS OUT.

12:01.889 --> 12:03.807
I WANT TO LEARN MORE ABOUT YOU,
SEE WHAT I'M DEALING WITH.

12:03.807 --> 12:06.226
OTHERWISE MY BRAIN IS JUST
GONNA FILL IN THE BLANKS.

12:08.436 --> 12:10.230
- OKAY.

12:18.906 --> 12:20.908

- HUH?

12:20.908 --> 12:22.742

12:22.742 --> 12:23.953
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO BE HERE.

12:23.953 --> 12:25.120
- YEAH, ME TOO.

12:25.120 --> 12:26.663
I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO BE HERE, EITHER.

12:26.663 --> 12:29.040
- WELL, I AM.

12:38.216 --> 12:39.759
- IS THAT THE WAY OUT?

12:39.759 --> 12:41.636
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING OVER HERE?
BACK IN LINE.

12:41.636 --> 12:42.762
YOU HEAR ME?

12:42.762 --> 12:44.139

12:44.139 --> 12:46.892
- MICKEY'S WAITING FOR ME,

12:46.892 --> 12:47.809
I NEED TO SEE FIONA.

12:47.809 --> 12:49.394

12:49.394 --> 12:51.563
DO YOU WANT ME TO SEDATE
YOUR DUMB, TURKEY ASS?

12:56.109 --> 12:57.527

I LOVE LUCY'S THINGS.

13:52.207 --> 13:53.792

13:53.792 --> 13:55.001
HE DOESN'T ND
THAT SHIT AT THE HOSPITAL.

13:55.001 --> 13:56.920
- NOT FOR HOSPITAL.
FOR MOVING OUT.

13:56.920 --> 13:59.130
- HE'S NOT MOVING OUT.
HE'S GONE FOR, LIKE, THREE DAYS.

13:59.130 --> 14:00.548
- HE CAN'T STAY HERE.

14:00.548 --> 14:01.967
- THE FUCK HE CAN'T.
SAYS WHO?

14:01.967 --> 14:03.718

14:05.053 --> 14:06.137
EVERYTHING IS FINE.

14:06.137 --> 14:08.390
THE BABY'S BACK SAFE AND SOUND.

14:08.390 --> 14:10.684
- COULD HAPPEN AGAIN.
- IT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN AGAIN.

14:10.684 --> 14:12.727
- BECAUSE HE DOESN'T
LIVE HERE ANYMORE.

14:14.688 --> 14:16.023
- YOU CAN'T JUST KICK HIM OUT.

14:16.023 --> 14:17.274
HE'S SICK.

14:17.274 --> 14:19.902
HE HAS A DISEASE,
LIKE FUCKING CANCER.

14:19.902 --> 14:21.319
WOULD YOU KICK HIM OUT
IF HE HAD CANCER?

14:21.319 --> 14:23.196
- IF CANCER
MAKES HIM STEAL BABY, YES.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.614
- WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:24.614 --> 14:25.949
IT'S NOT
YOUR FUCKING HOUSE, IS IT?

14:25.949 --> 14:27.784
THE WAY I SEE IT,
YOU'RE FREELOADING HERE.

14:27.784 --> 14:29.202
SO IF YOU DON'T LIKE IT,

14:29.202 --> 14:30.787
THE FRONT DOOR'S
PLENTY WIDE ENOUGH FOR YOU

14:30.787 --> 14:31.913
TO WALK THE FUCK OUT,

14:31.913 --> 14:33.665
FIND YOURSELF
SOMEWHERE ELSE TO LIVE.

14:38.003 --> 14:39.796

14:49.639 --> 14:51.266
THE PLACE IS A DUMP.

14:51.266 --> 14:53.102
WHAT ARE YOU GUYS DOING?

14:53.102 --> 14:55.104

AND HAND COORDINATION.

14:55.104 --> 14:57.355
SO, UH, DOES THIS MEAN
YOU GUYS ARE BROKEN UP?

14:57.355 --> 14:58.857
WHERE'S THE SQUEAKY TOY?

14:58.857 --> 15:00.275
- OH, NO, WE'RE NOT BROKEN UP.

15:00.275 --> 15:01.860
AT LEAST I DON'T THINK
WE'RE BROKEN UP.

15:01.860 --> 15:03.611
WHAT, YOU THINK VERONICA
WANTS TO BE BROKEN UP?

15:03.611 --> 15:05.655
- SHE'S YOUR WIFE.
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO KNOW?

15:05.655 --> 15:07.198
SO THIS IS A SEPARATION, THEN?

15:07.198 --> 15:09.034
I MEAN, YOU'RE JUST
PRESSING THE PAUSE BUTTON?

15:09.034 --> 15:10.201
- OH, WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE?

15:10.201 --> 15:13.038
I DON'T KNOW.
NEITHER?

15:13.038 --> 15:14.999
- DOMINICK.

15:14.999 --> 15:18.877
YES, HE FOUND HIS 'CAUSE HE'S
THE SMARTEST OF THE THREE.

15:18.877 --> 15:21.129
YOU SHOULD HAVE FUCKED THE SENSE
RIGHT BACK INTO HER.

15:21.129 --> 15:23.007
- ALL RIGHT,
PLEASE, NOT YOU, TOO.

15:23.007 --> 15:24.799
- LOOK, GOD GAVE YOU THAT
JOYSTICK TO CONTROL YOUR WOMAN,

15:24.799 --> 15:26.676
AND YOU'RE JUST LETTING THAT
THING DANGLE BETWEEN YOUR LEGS.

15:26.676 --> 15:28.219
- THIS IS NOT ALL MY FAULT.

15:28.219 --> 15:30.263
IF SHE WAS A LITTLE BIT MORE
INTO OUR KIDS, MAYBE,

15:30.263 --> 15:32.974
I DON'T KNOW, IT WOULD TURN ME
ON AND I COULD FUCK HER.

15:32.974 --> 15:35.560
- YOU DO HAVE A POINT, THERE.
- I DO?

15:35.560 --> 15:37.062
- THERE'S NOTHING SEXIER

15:37.062 --> 15:38.938
THAN SEEING THE PERSON
YOU LOVE BE A GOOD PARENT.

15:38.938 --> 15:39.939
- EXACTLY.

15:39.939 --> 15:41.483
- I REMEMBER THE WAY MY REGINALD

15:41.483 --> 15:43.443
USED TO THROW VERONICA
AND HER BROTHER IN THE AIR.

15:43.443 --> 15:45.528
OOH, GOT MY JUICES FLOWING.

15:45.528 --> 15:48.406

34:17.890 --> 34:19.725
LOVE IS A INFINITE,
RENEWABLE SOURCE.

34:19.725 --> 34:21.310

36:18.385 --> 36:19.928
- DOES THAT MEAN
I CAN LEAVE NOW?

36:19.928 --> 36:22.348
- YOU SIGNED AN AUTHORIZATION
TO BE ADMITTED.

36:22.348 --> 36:25.142
- MY FAMILY WANTED ME TO.
- WHY'S THAT?

36:25.142 --> 36:27.603
- UH, THEY THINK I HAVE
WHAT MY MOTHER HAS.

36:27.603 --> 36:29.272

TO KILL HERSELF.

36:44.036 --> 36:46.330
AND THEN WOULD TAKE US
ON A SHOPPING SPREE,

36:46.330 --> 36:47.664
AND THEN SHE WOULD SLEEP
ON THE COUCH

36:47.664 --> 36:49.374
DEPRESSED FOR MONTHS,
AND THEN WOULD THROW US

36:49.374 --> 36:51.377
A BIG PARTY IN THE PARK
FOR ONE OUR BIRTHDAYS,

36:51.377 --> 36:53.378
AND THEN LEAVE US ON THE STREET
CORNER TO BUY DRUGS.

36:53.378 --> 36:55.381
SHOULD I GO ON?

36:55.381 --> 36:56.882
- HAVE YOU DONE ANY OF
THE THINGS YOUR MOTHER'S DONE?

36:56.882 --> 36:58.508
- NO.

37:03.305 --> 37:07.309
- POLICE REPORT SAYS YOU STOLE
YOUR LOVER'S BABY AND TOOK HIM--

37:07.309 --> 37:09.311

THEY WERE TRYING TO STEAL HIM.

37:09.311 --> 37:11.521

37:11.521 --> 37:12.731
WHO WAS TRYING TO STEAL HIM?

37:12.731 --> 37:14.317
- NO, WE WERE GOING TO ORLANDO,

37:14.317 --> 37:15.901
AND THEN THE POLICE
TRIED TO STEAL HIM.

37:15.901 --> 37:17.277
- YOU KNOW THAT'S NOT TRUE,
RIGHT?

37:17.277 --> 37:19.237
- WERE YOU THERE?

37:19.237 --> 37:21.990
- I WAS NOT.

37:21.990 --> 37:25.369
YOU RAN INTO A GROCERY STORE
SCREAMING THAT GABRIEL'S DEMONS

37:25.369 --> 37:26.662
WERE TRYING TO TAKE THE BABY.

37:26.662 --> 37:28.246
- I LEFT HIM FOR,
LIKE, TWO MINUTES, OKAY?

37:28.246 --> 37:31.124
- A WITNESS SAYS IT WAS 20.
- SHE WAS OLD.

37:31.124 --> 37:32.668
- YOU PUT THAT BABY
IN HARM'S WAY.

37:32.668 --> 37:34.461
- I LOVE YEVGENY.

37:34.461 --> 37:35.754

37:35.754 --> 37:37.255
WHY ISN'T SHE IN HERE?

37:40.300 --> 37:42.303
- I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT
TO HEAR THIS, IAN,

37:42.303 --> 37:45.013
BUT YOU SHOW SIGNS
OF BIPOLAR DISORDER.

37:47.433 --> 37:49.976
LOOK, WITH PROPER MEDICATION,
IT CAN BE MANAGED.

37:49.976 --> 37:52.354
BUT YOU NEED TO PARTICIPATE
IN YOUR TREATMENT.

37:56.484 --> 37:59.487
WHY DON'T WE TALK AGAIN
TOMORROW?

37:59.487 --> 38:02.447
- I PAINTED THIS AND NO ONE
MADE FUN OF ME.

38:02.447 --> 38:05.158
- OH, CHUCKIE.

38:05.158 --> 38:09.162
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE FINALLY HAPPY
AT YOUR NEW SCHOOL.

38:09.162 --> 38:11.498

38:14.876 --> 38:16.211

38:18.588 --> 38:20.215
CHUCKIE, BRING MY MY FOOD.

38:20.215 --> 38:21.758

YOU WILL DO NO SUCH THING.

38:21.758 --> 38:24.511
CARL, WHY IS CHUCKIE YOUR SLAVE?

38:24.511 --> 38:25.929
- NEEDED TO SWEETEN OUR DEAL.

38:25.929 --> 38:27.597

38:27.597 --> 38:28.849
- I KNOW,

38:28.849 --> 38:32.144
- GOOD EVENING, FAMILY.

38:32.144 --> 38:34.146
ONE FOR YOU

38:34.146 --> 38:35.355
AND ONE FOR YOU.

38:35.355 --> 38:37.149

38:37.149 --> 38:38.650
GET OUT.

38:38.650 --> 38:40.736

A REGISTERED LETTER THIS SUMMER?

38:45.449 --> 38:47.368
- I DON'T KNOW.

38:47.368 --> 38:49.453
DOES ANYONE THINK TO GET RID
OF THE FUCKING JUNK MAIL?

38:49.453 --> 38:50.787

38:50.787 --> 38:52.456
TO KEEP THIS HOUSE AFLOAT, LIP.

- COOL.

38:58.628 --> 39:00.881
- YOU DO NOT GET TO EAT MY FOOD.

39:00.881 --> 39:02.591
- SERIOUSLY, GUYS,
WHERE COULD IT BE?

39:02.591 --> 39:04.468
IT'S FROM THE GOVERNMENT.
- I DIDN'T TOUCH IT.

39:04.468 --> 39:05.802
- CHUCKIE, GET ME SALT.

39:05.802 --> 39:07.596
- CHUCKIE, NO.

39:07.596 --> 39:09.347

- I JUST HAD TO TAKE OUT
A $5,000 CASH ADVANCE, OKAY?

39:23.403 --> 39:24.654

39:24.654 --> 39:26.406
- LOOK, MY CREDIT IS RUINED

39:26.406 --> 39:28.825
BECAUSE NOBODY TOLD ME ABOUT
THESE GODDAMN FUCKING PAPERS.

39:28.825 --> 39:31.161
- WE'RE ALL ADULTS HERE, LIP.

39:31.161 --> 39:34.540
WE HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY
FOR OUR OWN ACTIONS.

39:34.540 --> 39:36.208
WE CAN'T RELY ON EACH OTHER.

39:36.208 --> 39:38.418
IT COMES OFF
AS NEEDY AND DESPERATE.

39:38.418 --> 39:41.421
- I AM NOT NEEDY OR DESPERATE.
