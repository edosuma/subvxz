WEBVTT

01:18.843 --> 01:21.413
Oh my goodness.

01:21.446 --> 01:27.619
Oh, hello. Welcome. I'm just
reading this remarkable story about

01:28.553 --> 01:31.723
you know, the man here,
the man of the hour.

01:31.756 --> 01:37.963
I guess it's true, fact can be
sometimes stranger than fiction.

01:39.497 --> 01:46.905
Dear old Bernie. What a
story, want to hear it? Oh, why not?

01:46.938 --> 01:49.241
What else are you going to do
for the next hour or so.

01:49.274 --> 01:51.577
Once upon a time,

01:51.610 --> 01:54.846
in the land of the free
and the home of the brave,

01:54.880 --> 02:01.920
came a man who thought capitalism was,
oh, so great. In a country much blessed,

02:01.953 --> 02:07.259
he was very unimpressed.
Believing the prosperous to be evil,

02:07.292 --> 02:10.328
he devised a plan of upheaval.

02:10.362 --> 02:15.467
"Free stuff for all," he opined,
"On the taxpayer's dime."

02:15.501 --> 02:21.340
And thinking himself quite clever
and grand, he attempted to become

02:21.372 --> 02:23.675
leader of the land.

02:23.709 --> 02:27.712
Come with me and as we go on,

02:27.745 --> 02:34.786
you'll see exactly
what could go wrong. Oh, Bernie.

02:34.819 --> 02:38.823
Bless his cotton socks.

03:44.923 --> 03:49.527
Bernie, what can you tell
us about Hillary's email controversy?

03:49.561 --> 03:53.633
Do you agree with the Republican's
call for your opponent to be locked up?

03:55.633 --> 03:58.738
<i>Go for it.
Go for the jugular, buddy.</i>

03:58.770 --> 04:01.607
<i>You could take Hillary out
once and for all.</i>

04:01.639 --> 04:03.875
<i>You can be president.
You can be president.</i>

04:03.908 --> 04:05.377
- Bernie.
- Huh?

04:05.411 --> 04:07.646
Bernie, your response.

04:09.847 --> 04:13.685
All I've got to say about that
is the American people

04:13.718 --> 04:17.655
are sick and tired
of hearing about her emails.

04:21.859 --> 04:23.095
Oh, crap.

04:25.763 --> 04:26.965
Crap! Crap!

04:30.636 --> 04:35.441
Hillary!

04:35.474 --> 04:36.409
Oh, crap.

04:49.754 --> 04:52.424
Hi, sweetie,
go wash up for dinner.

04:52.458 --> 04:55.094
Wait a second. Stop. stop.

04:55.126 --> 04:58.163
Oh my God. Bernard, another
black eye what happened?

04:58.196 --> 05:01.766
- Nothing.
- Harris Todd steal your lunch money again?

05:01.799 --> 05:04.936
- I will go to that school. I will break his little fingers.
- I don't want to talk about it.

05:04.970 --> 05:06.839
You never want to talk about it.

05:32.797 --> 05:34.532
What's going to
become of our Bernie?

05:34.566 --> 05:39.772
What? Easy, easy, easy. Come on.
What? He'll find his way.

05:39.804 --> 05:42.507
No, no, no.
I'm serious about this.

05:42.540 --> 05:45.577
Is he going to be a doctor? No!

05:45.611 --> 05:47.813
Is he going to be
a shrewd lawyer?

05:47.845 --> 05:49.814
- What are the chances?
- What? Come on. Come on.

05:49.847 --> 05:51.984
Wait. Do you think he'll be
a prosperous businessman.

05:52.016 --> 05:53.585
- It's never gonna happen!
- You don't know that!

05:53.619 --> 05:55.921
I'm sick and tired of rich kids

05:55.953 --> 05:58.756
like Harris Todd
stealing my lunch!

05:58.789 --> 06:03.061
Let's face facts.
Darcy, let's face facts.

06:03.095 --> 06:06.999
Bernie hasn't been the same since
he became interested in cloning.

06:07.032 --> 06:10.068
Oh, stop it. You're obsessed with the
Communism. As far as I'm concerned,

06:10.102 --> 06:12.905
- I think he's on to something.
- All right, at this juncture,

06:12.938 --> 06:15.908
he'll be lucky if he becomes
a pharmacist or even

06:15.941 --> 06:17.643
a soda jerk for that matter.

06:17.676 --> 06:21.514
From now on, <i>I</i> get the lunches.

06:24.715 --> 06:28.220
I'm ready, Comrade Stalin.
I'm ready.

06:32.691 --> 06:37.929
If you want to have a doctor, well, maybe
we should think about having more kids.

06:39.196 --> 06:40.932
Huh.

06:40.965 --> 06:42.001
We could do that.

06:55.147 --> 06:58.851
- Come here. Come on, the hands.
- Okay, you and your hands. Oh my God. No!

06:58.883 --> 07:04.657
I totally pledge with this
blood oath to dedicate my life

07:04.689 --> 07:07.091
to never picking up
a dinner check,

07:07.124 --> 07:12.564
never donating to charity, like
in the glorious Soviet Union.

07:12.597 --> 07:16.669
Making sure the government
pays for everything.

07:17.736 --> 07:21.106
And I mean everything.

07:24.842 --> 07:26.110
Oh my God,
you're like an animal.

07:26.143 --> 07:28.013
Ow!

07:28.046 --> 07:30.049
Get your hands off of me!

07:30.082 --> 07:31.784
Ow! Owee!

07:31.816 --> 07:34.186
Oh my God, stop it!

07:45.196 --> 07:47.632
Five alpha, take one, mark one.

07:51.369 --> 07:55.006
I have to say, bullying
Bernie was problematic.

07:55.039 --> 07:59.777
But he was prone to fainting which
needless to say made it very difficult

07:59.811 --> 08:01.347
to shake him down
for lunch money.

08:02.414 --> 08:04.817
Because you know once I, uh,

08:04.850 --> 08:08.621
confronted him, he did pass out
right there on the playground.

08:10.321 --> 08:12.824
Now that I think about it, uh,

08:12.857 --> 08:14.926
I fully believe
that was a tactic.

08:14.960 --> 08:17.196
What he lacked in intelligence,

08:17.229 --> 08:19.664
he made up with sloth.

08:19.698 --> 08:21.200
Know our first date?

08:21.232 --> 08:24.836
I paid for the movie
and the popcorn,

08:24.869 --> 08:27.939
and he said is it...

08:27.972 --> 08:29.074
Oh. Pff!

08:30.275 --> 08:31.210
No.

08:33.210 --> 08:35.080
I don't know why
you have to go up to Vermont.

08:35.113 --> 08:37.650
It's a godforsaken place where
there are more cows than people.

08:37.682 --> 08:39.851
An eagle has to soar, Ma.

08:39.884 --> 08:42.720
- So, there's a pigeon.
- Technically pigeons don't actually soar,

08:42.753 --> 08:45.056
they just sort of flap their wings
around for short periods of time!

08:45.090 --> 08:48.060
- Spitting hairs.
- Freida says that they don't have a synagogue

08:48.093 --> 08:51.229
- in the entire state!
- Did Freida also tell you that Vermont has some of

08:51.263 --> 08:53.666
the most lenient welfare
qualifications in the country?

08:53.699 --> 08:56.101
Let the boy go, Dorothy.

08:56.133 --> 08:58.103
He's eating us
out of house and home.

08:59.437 --> 09:02.206
- I'm gonna miss you.
- Ma.

09:02.239 --> 09:04.176
- Dorothy.
- All right, Ma.

09:04.209 --> 09:06.012
Dorothy! Come here, you.

09:06.945 --> 09:09.348
Son, just one
little piece of advice.

09:09.380 --> 09:12.016
- Yeah?
- Watch out for those mountain women,

09:12.050 --> 09:14.820
- they'll break you in half.
- Mountain women. Okay, thanks, Pa.

09:14.853 --> 09:16.689
Bernard, wait.

09:18.389 --> 09:24.295
I found these under your bed. It gets cold
in Vermont. I figured you could use them.

09:27.298 --> 09:29.734
Okay. Thanks, Mom.

09:53.892 --> 09:57.229
George Washington?
What are you doing here?

09:57.262 --> 10:00.398
It was either me or Jefferson,
and I drew the short straw.

10:00.431 --> 10:01.933
But why?

10:03.301 --> 10:05.771
You are... you need to
get your mind right.

10:05.803 --> 10:08.172
- It's not too late.
- Okay. My mind is perfectly fine.

10:08.205 --> 10:11.777
- Thank you very much.
- That's exactly what Benedict Arnold said.

10:11.810 --> 10:15.114
- What are you insinuating?
- Bernie.

10:15.147 --> 10:19.184
This country was founded on the principles
of freedom, equality and prosperity.

10:19.216 --> 10:21.252
America is
The shining city on the hill.

10:21.286 --> 10:24.356
It's a beacon of opportunity
for we, the people...

10:24.388 --> 10:28.092
Woah. By we, the people,
do you mean the wealthy one percent

10:28.125 --> 10:29.927
or the evil corporations?

10:29.960 --> 10:33.431
Believe it or not Bernie,
one day...

10:33.465 --> 10:34.934
you're gonna be a one percent.

10:36.000 --> 10:37.068
- Really?
- Mm.

10:38.069 --> 10:40.005
No, I mean, that's bad.

10:40.037 --> 10:42.975
That's... that's very bad. Then
I'm going to change it to being

10:43.008 --> 10:45.410
the one tenth of one percent.

10:45.442 --> 10:48.946
Look, I've got to get
to another dream for this

10:48.979 --> 10:52.317
- Cherokee woman named Elizabeth who's about to apply to Harvard.
- Right on.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.855
You can still turn back.
It's not too late.

10:59.257 --> 11:01.994
Nah. Sorry,
but I got a blood pact

11:02.027 --> 11:04.263
with another founding father
from a different country.

11:04.296 --> 11:07.800
Hey, I know all about your Joseph
Stalin, the man who killed

11:07.832 --> 11:11.035
20 million of his own
countrymen in the name

11:11.069 --> 11:15.340
- of Socialism and really...
- That number seems a little bit high to me.

11:15.373 --> 11:18.811
Also, it's Communism
not Socialism, by the way.

11:18.844 --> 11:23.181
Your intransigence
will define you.

11:39.598 --> 11:42.200
<i>♪ Move to the suburbs? ♪</i>

11:43.634 --> 11:45.837
Bombing moved out of state.

11:47.339 --> 11:49.842
Gone gone to the next world.

11:51.343 --> 11:53.312
Just.

12:02.486 --> 12:03.955
Headed to Vermont?

12:07.024 --> 12:10.128
- Why are you off to Vermont, pal?
- I don't know.

12:11.595 --> 12:13.431
- I'd rather not say.
- Well...

12:13.465 --> 12:15.367
I'm gonna say you're headed

12:15.399 --> 12:17.535
to Vermont for the easy
wealthy payments.

12:17.569 --> 12:20.639
Am I right?
'Cause you know what, pal?

12:20.672 --> 12:23.008
You've got welfare cheat
written all over you.

12:30.348 --> 12:34.253
If you must know, I've gone to Vermont
to be part of the utopian commune

12:34.286 --> 12:38.290
in the same vein as the Soviet Union.

12:38.322 --> 12:41.125
All right, old pal,
you know what?

12:41.158 --> 12:46.631
I might not speak French, but I can
understand bullshit when I hear it, eh?

12:46.665 --> 12:50.235
Let me be perfectly clear.
There's nothing wrong with Communism.

12:50.268 --> 12:53.906
Oh, right oh. The fourth
Marx brother then now, are we?

12:53.939 --> 12:58.243
Well, actually, there were four Marx
brothers, so technically speaking

12:58.276 --> 13:01.079
if I was an extra brother,
I'd be the fifth Marx brother.

13:01.111 --> 13:04.482
Whatever, pal. You're
a bit of a joker either way.

13:10.021 --> 13:13.358
And why, pray tell are you going
to the Green Mountain State?

13:13.391 --> 13:15.995
For real, I'm not
clipping the government.

13:17.394 --> 13:19.297
I'm clipping sheep.

13:19.330 --> 13:20.632
What's the difference?

13:52.529 --> 13:56.968
<i>Hello, Mother. Hello, Father.</i>

13:57.002 --> 14:01.239
<i>Here I am at Camp Granola.</i>

14:01.272 --> 14:07.378
<i>Camp is not so super gripping.
But I think I'll have some fun.</i>

14:07.412 --> 14:14.353
<i>When I stop tripping. I did
mushrooms with Jill Spivey.</i>

14:14.385 --> 14:16.988
<i>She developed poison ivy.</i>

14:31.668 --> 14:35.006
- Sanders, we need to have a discussion.
- Yeah. Yeah, of course.

14:35.040 --> 14:39.244
- What is it Miss, Qin?
- Have I or have I not asked you multiple times

14:39.277 --> 14:41.213
to clean
the downstairs bathroom?

14:41.245 --> 14:43.581
I seem to recall you mentioning
something about that in passing.

14:43.614 --> 14:46.350
However, I'm certain there are
other members of this commune

14:46.383 --> 14:50.154
that are more qualified for
that particular job than me.

14:51.790 --> 14:54.192
I'm trying to stay
centered here,

14:54.225 --> 14:56.027
but it seems
pretty obvious to me

14:56.061 --> 14:58.662
that you don't
get what a commune is.

14:58.696 --> 15:02.566
Madame, I assure you that I am familiar
with the concept of the collective.

15:02.600 --> 15:07.571
No, no, we divvy up all the household chores
to maintain our existence and we share all

15:07.604 --> 15:12.643
material goods for the betterment of
all, we're creating a Utopia.

15:12.676 --> 15:15.714
Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. I read the brochure.

15:18.450 --> 15:22.653
And speaking of sharing. Why
are you bogarting your stash?

15:22.686 --> 15:24.388
That is a totally
false accusation.

15:24.422 --> 15:27.392
I want everyone to be
as high as I am

15:27.425 --> 15:29.361
or possibly even higher.

15:30.628 --> 15:33.698
We found this
under a rock in the backyard.

15:33.730 --> 15:38.702
LSD, psilocybin,
Thai sticks. Primo shit, Bernie.

15:38.735 --> 15:41.739
I swear to you,
that is not mine.

15:41.773 --> 15:45.811
Oh. And we found this picture of
you stashing it under the rock!

15:45.844 --> 15:48.647
- That could be anybody.
- Oh, really? Well, it looks like you.

15:48.680 --> 15:51.516
- Look at that hair.
- Okay, I'll come clean.

15:51.548 --> 15:55.619
Yeah, that's me. But I swear to you, I was
just holding on to that stuff for a friend.

15:55.652 --> 16:00.725
You are so screwed.

16:03.194 --> 16:07.365
- Did I mention that I had a blood pact with Stalin?
- Congratulations.

16:12.736 --> 16:14.338
Ouch!

16:14.372 --> 16:16.641
What a bastard.

16:16.673 --> 16:21.112
All right, 30 seconds,
scene 10, take two, slap sticks.

16:22.880 --> 16:25.749
Bernie Sanders.

16:25.782 --> 16:27.351
Where do I start?

16:34.425 --> 16:40.232
Well, for one thing, he really enjoyed
doing things with other people's money.

16:42.600 --> 16:46.838
Like the one time he organized
a big May Day celebration.

16:46.870 --> 16:51.143
He collected five dollars
from everyone in the commune

16:51.176 --> 16:56.248
for what he said would be a big feast
followed by some mind-blowing fireworks.

16:56.281 --> 16:58.383
But what did we get?

16:59.651 --> 17:03.287
Some really
bad borscht and burning.

17:04.555 --> 17:05.823
On the front lawn.

17:07.859 --> 17:09.927
In a loincloth.

17:09.961 --> 17:12.697
And something just
that I can never unsee

17:12.730 --> 17:15.834
were some really
lame sparklers, okay?

17:15.867 --> 17:19.738
It still messes
with my head to this day.

17:21.839 --> 17:23.875
Dude.

17:23.907 --> 17:26.211
All I gotta say is...

17:26.244 --> 17:29.180
can you really trust
a man that bogarts?

17:30.380 --> 17:33.417
Think about it, man.

17:33.451 --> 17:34.419
Think about it.

17:37.621 --> 17:41.258
- Pig!
- I'm definitely feeling oppressed here.

17:41.292 --> 17:47.365
I still can't imagine how this guy
became a United States Senator.

17:47.398 --> 17:51.802
I guess failing upward
is a thing in Vermont.

18:00.278 --> 18:02.981
Oh, man.

18:03.013 --> 18:04.483
Next.

18:11.388 --> 18:13.257
Do you mind?

18:17.695 --> 18:20.532
Excuse me.

18:20.564 --> 18:22.633
I'm not a big fan
of public displays of laughter.

18:22.667 --> 18:26.638
- I find that to be very off-putting.
- What's your problem, pal?

18:26.670 --> 18:28.974
I'm working on an excuse for
Why an able-bodied man has been

18:29.006 --> 18:31.243
unemployed for 20 years,
and your laughter is

18:31.275 --> 18:33.911
a little distracting.
Like, what's your angle?

18:34.978 --> 18:37.915
- Angle?
- Yeah, you know, to get the check.

18:39.516 --> 18:42.620
I was... I was a foreman of the papers
in the factory that just shut down.

18:42.654 --> 18:45.824
I worked there since I graduated high
school and I got two kids in college.

18:45.857 --> 18:48.859
- So, pff. Here I am.
- They're never gonna buy that.

18:48.892 --> 18:51.862
You got anything else?

18:52.763 --> 18:54.965
Have you tried,
death of a loved one?

18:54.998 --> 18:57.902
Yeah, more times than I can count.
I'm actually running out of loved ones.

18:59.369 --> 19:00.504
I guess that didn't take long.

19:00.538 --> 19:01.973
Next.

19:02.005 --> 19:04.708
An unemployable guy
with no sense of humor.

19:04.742 --> 19:07.479
You should try politics.

19:07.512 --> 19:11.649
Like this guy. He made $100,000
just by running for office.

19:11.683 --> 19:14.819
- That's impressive.
- Yeah, he ran for Attorney General of Pennsylvania.

19:14.851 --> 19:17.321
He raised $100,000
for his campaign.

19:18.523 --> 19:19.924
That's... yeah.

19:19.956 --> 19:22.293
Next!

19:22.327 --> 19:24.763
Yeah, but the rub is,
he only spent

19:24.795 --> 19:27.898
$20,000 on his campaign
and he freaking lost.

19:27.932 --> 19:29.401
- Hey.
- So?

19:29.434 --> 19:31.936
So? He got to eat the leftovers.

19:31.968 --> 19:33.571
Look at the swimming pool
in his house. Right?

19:33.603 --> 19:36.340
Look at his swimming pool.
Not bad, huh?

19:36.373 --> 19:37.775
Tell you what,

19:37.809 --> 19:40.845
politicians,
they got a license to steal

19:40.878 --> 19:44.081
and there's no heavy lifting.

19:44.115 --> 19:46.818
Next!

19:49.686 --> 19:51.322
- You're up.
- Are you finished with that?

19:51.356 --> 19:53.458
- Yeah.
- Thank you very much...

19:53.491 --> 19:54.658
- Sure.
- ...kind sir.

19:54.692 --> 19:56.561
Anytime.

19:56.593 --> 20:00.298
- Next!
- Ah, we got a bitch.

20:01.131 --> 20:02.700
Are you kidding?

20:06.704 --> 20:09.607
Have you had any work
in the past 30 days?

20:09.639 --> 20:13.344
Just a little light carpentry. However,
I'm also trying my hand at writing.

20:14.378 --> 20:16.548
What kind of writing?

20:16.580 --> 20:20.984
Adult situational erotica,
like Anais Nin?

20:21.017 --> 20:24.355
- Any income from this writing?
- Not yet.

20:24.388 --> 20:28.726
However, I've got a bondage fantasy
piece that's getting a lot of interest.

20:28.760 --> 20:31.096
Gross.

20:34.831 --> 20:35.801
Thank you.

20:39.035 --> 20:41.572

Sanders, your banned
till you pay your tax.

21:03.427 --> 21:05.097
No, good news, good news,
I can pay, see?

21:07.497 --> 21:11.034
You know damn well it's illegal
for bars to cash welfare checks.

21:11.068 --> 21:12.936
I prefer to call it
temporary public assistance.

21:12.969 --> 21:16.573
That you're on permanently.
The answer's still no.

21:16.607 --> 21:18.777
Fine. Good day to you, sir.

21:29.020 --> 21:33.458
- Hey.
- So we were just discussing the best ways to, uh...

21:33.491 --> 21:36.161
- stick it to the man.
- Guys, guys, guys.

21:36.194 --> 21:39.763
- I have it all figured out.
- Yeah, you say that every time you get your welfare check.

21:39.796 --> 21:41.832
Hey, I prefer to call it
temporary public assistance,

21:41.866 --> 21:44.536
which by the way, is the right
of every human being.

21:44.569 --> 21:46.704
Sure,
Bernie, whatever.

21:46.736 --> 21:48.773
No, I'm being serious.

21:48.805 --> 21:50.975
We need to become...

21:52.009 --> 21:52.977
politicians.

21:57.715 --> 22:00.984
Hey. All we've been talking about
are ways to take down the man.

22:01.017 --> 22:03.053
Why the hell would
we want to become the mayor?

22:03.087 --> 22:05.424
Just think about
the Trojan horses.

22:07.625 --> 22:09.727
- Horse condoms.
- No.

22:09.760 --> 22:12.629
Are you not talking about
equine prophylactic.

22:12.663 --> 22:14.032
The Trojan Horse.

22:15.565 --> 22:18.869
The Trojans built a horse to sneak into
the city of Troy. Look, never mind.

22:18.903 --> 22:22.707
The point is that if we want
to stick it to the man,

22:22.740 --> 22:25.109
we have to get inside
the gates of power.

22:26.077 --> 22:27.212
What's the plan?

22:28.513 --> 22:33.685
Simple. We create our own party.

22:33.717 --> 22:35.219
And then we start
running for office.

22:35.253 --> 22:39.023
Doesn't running for election
cost big bucks, man?

22:39.055 --> 22:41.024
That's the beauty of it.

22:41.058 --> 22:43.528
We get people to donate
to our campaigns,

22:43.561 --> 22:47.264
then after we lose, we can use the
rest of the money for whatever we want.

22:47.298 --> 22:49.534
It's all right there.

22:50.967 --> 22:53.705
So, what are we going to
call this new political party?

22:54.638 --> 22:59.142
The Soviet Union party, SUP.

22:59.176 --> 23:01.012
It's catchy don't you think.

23:01.044 --> 23:03.580
You think that in the middle
of the Cold War

23:03.613 --> 23:06.083
- people are going to warm up to a name like that?
- All right. All right.

23:06.117 --> 23:08.720
Then what's your brilliant idea,
Mr. horse condoms?

23:09.954 --> 23:11.656
- Drop the Soviet.
- Ooh.

23:11.688 --> 23:13.757
- But that's the best part.
- No.

23:15.126 --> 23:21.065
Something Union...
the something, you need that something.

23:21.098 --> 23:25.069
- People's Union.
- The People's Union? Poo.

23:25.101 --> 23:27.037
Nah. That's no good.
No, that stinks.

23:27.071 --> 23:30.641
How about a bait-and-switch.

23:30.675 --> 23:35.280
- Liberty Union Party.
- Liberty Union Party?

23:36.313 --> 23:40.551
"Hi. I'm from the Liberty Union Party.
Give your donations to the Liberty...

23:40.584 --> 23:42.119
to the Liberty Union Party."

23:42.153 --> 23:44.589
"We're from
the Liberty Union Party."

23:44.621 --> 23:45.789
It's not bad.

23:47.058 --> 23:48.159
All right.

23:48.192 --> 23:49.794
To the Liberty Union Party.

23:49.827 --> 23:51.930
- Woo!
- I got dibs on governor.

23:53.697 --> 23:56.301
<i>Democrat Thomas Salmon
wins the Vermont Governor's</i>

23:56.333 --> 23:58.936
<i>race with 54% of the vote.</i>

23:58.969 --> 24:01.071
- Hmm.
- <i>Republican Luther Hackett</i>

24:01.105 --> 24:03.074
<i>was second with 44% of the vote.</i>

24:03.107 --> 24:05.910
- Not bad.
- <i>And Liberty Union candidate Bernie Sanders</i>

24:05.943 --> 24:08.246
<i>with a very, very distant third,</i>

24:08.279 --> 24:10.682
<i>with less than
one percent of the vote.</i>

24:12.716 --> 24:14.319
- You want another beer?
- Giddy-up.

24:14.351 --> 24:17.788
- Right.
- Oh, hey.

24:17.821 --> 24:18.856
Oh.

24:18.888 --> 24:19.991
When you have a chance, could we

24:20.023 --> 24:21.859
get a couple more drinks?

24:21.891 --> 24:24.661
Yeah. Oh, hey,
did you win your race?

24:24.695 --> 24:28.832
- No. It was close.
- At least you're trying, right?

24:30.368 --> 24:31.769
Yeah.

25:45.876 --> 25:48.245
Um, I'll have Alex send
a couple beers.

25:50.747 --> 25:52.116
Okay.

25:58.388 --> 25:59.791
Hey.

26:01.024 --> 26:02.426
That waitress, huh?

26:02.459 --> 26:05.362
Yeah. I don't know, Bernie.

26:05.396 --> 26:09.901
Maybe this wasn't, uh, such a good idea.
Kind of got our asses handed to us.

26:09.934 --> 26:13.971
Are you kidding me? While
drinking on campaign donations.

26:14.003 --> 26:17.942
- We'd be nuts to stop now.
- Sanders, pay your tab.

26:24.013 --> 26:27.350
There you go.
My tab paid in full.

26:27.384 --> 26:29.887
And there's an extra five

26:29.919 --> 26:33.090
- in there for you, my good man.
- Five dollars.

26:33.123 --> 26:38.361
Yep. That's what the Liberty Union party
is all about, helping the working man.

26:38.395 --> 26:41.898
Oh, yeah? Well, this working man's
going to take this five dollars

26:41.932 --> 26:44.001
and buy that house
on Lake Champlain

26:44.033 --> 26:47.938
- I've always dreamed about.
- Hey, good for you.

26:47.972 --> 26:49.273
Jesus.

26:50.574 --> 26:54.144
- Are we gonna smoke that or what?
- Yeah, you got a lighter?

26:55.980 --> 26:58.916
- No.
- Got any matches?

26:58.948 --> 27:00.984
Oh my goodness.

27:01.017 --> 27:04.254
Bernie and his pals
ran for every office

27:04.288 --> 27:08.359
from Cemetery Commissioner to
Governor every election cycle.

27:08.391 --> 27:10.061
Hello, miss? No?

27:10.093 --> 27:11.495
<i>And as Chaucer said</i>

27:11.529 --> 27:13.431
<i>in</i> The Tale of Melibee,

27:13.464 --> 27:16.399
<i>"Familiarity breeds contempt."</i>

27:18.968 --> 27:21.304
<i>And for a Frenchman,
he was spot on.</i>

27:21.338 --> 27:24.175
<i>The more Bernie and his radical
buddies ran for office...</i>

27:25.576 --> 27:26.978
Next!

27:27.011 --> 27:29.113
<i>...the worse they did.</i>

27:42.392 --> 27:44.194
Good day.

27:44.227 --> 27:45.263
So.

27:46.563 --> 27:49.833
There I was standing
on the street corner.

27:49.867 --> 27:51.335
A public thoroughfare,
by the way.

27:51.368 --> 27:53.337
My leg! Ooh!

27:53.369 --> 27:56.541
My leg! Anyone?

27:56.573 --> 28:01.211
And I was knocked to the ground
because of my political beliefs.

28:02.580 --> 28:07.318
Do you know the penalties for
filing a fault workers comp claim?

28:12.022 --> 28:13.558
Is it bad?

28:13.590 --> 28:16.459
If you like spending
three years in the slammer...

28:16.493 --> 28:19.330
- not so bad.
- Three years?

28:19.362 --> 28:20.864
There's an echo in here?

28:29.974 --> 28:33.444
I'm cured! It's a miracle.

28:33.476 --> 28:37.948
There you go. There you go.
Merry Christmas to you.

28:42.019 --> 28:46.991
Ah. Please. Bernie was left
once again to ponder his future.

28:47.023 --> 28:51.262
But as quick as you can say Jerry
Garcia, the perpetually unemployed

28:51.294 --> 28:58.034
Bernie made friends with some once
and future ice cream entrepreneurs.

28:58.068 --> 28:58.936
Next election...

29:00.103 --> 29:03.340
I'm gonna run for senate.
I'm thinking...

29:06.443 --> 29:10.615
that the Liberty Union Party having
a candidate for the Federal Office

29:10.648 --> 29:14.318
will at least double
the campaign contributions.

29:14.350 --> 29:16.620
Well, failing upwards
is an American birthright.

29:16.654 --> 29:20.124
Yeah, man, one word,
Ted Kennedy.

29:22.359 --> 29:24.328
So can I put you guys
down for contributions?

29:24.360 --> 29:27.297
Look, man,
we've got ice cream to make.

29:27.330 --> 29:29.600
Yeah, man.
And flavors to invent.

29:31.334 --> 29:33.503
Almost forgot to tell you.

29:33.536 --> 29:37.908
I met a woman who has
agreed to marry me.

29:38.609 --> 29:40.110
I'm Santa Claus.

29:40.144 --> 29:42.546
- Ho-ho-ho!
- No, seriously.

29:42.579 --> 29:44.447
We're going to Moscow
on our honeymoon.

29:44.481 --> 29:46.584
Oh, Moscow. Really?

29:46.617 --> 29:48.519
You sure you don't want
to just go to Youngstown?

29:48.551 --> 29:51.455
Youngstown? Eugh.

29:51.487 --> 29:55.558
Seeing Moscow has always been...
my lifelong dream.

29:55.591 --> 29:58.428
Well, good luck with that.

30:02.498 --> 30:06.370
Expensive ice cream, as if
that will ever catch on.

30:08.504 --> 30:12.376
Oh, man, I could go for
some ice cream right now.

30:12.408 --> 30:15.612
<i>And so, Bernie and the nice
waitress from the bar got married,</i>

30:15.646 --> 30:18.316
<i>and off they went.</i>

30:20.250 --> 30:24.555
<i>And their honeymoon
was blissful by all accounts.</i>

30:27.157 --> 30:29.393
<i>No, not to the Caribbean.</i>

30:29.426 --> 30:34.130
<i>No, not to Mexico,
not to Cancun.</i>

30:40.003 --> 30:41.205
<i>To Moscow!</i>

30:45.109 --> 30:47.544
So... want to...

30:49.112 --> 30:51.748
- rock the casbah?
- No, thank you.

30:51.782 --> 30:55.720
- Come on, please.
- Honey, since we have been here, all we have done

30:55.753 --> 30:59.156
are visit the tombs of Lenin and
Stalin where you weep uncontrollably.

30:59.188 --> 31:01.359
- But I told you that those guys are my heroes.
- Be that as it may,

31:01.391 --> 31:04.195
it's not exactly the kind of thing
that puts a woman in the mood.

31:04.227 --> 31:06.464
You're kidding me,
seeing the open caskets

31:06.496 --> 31:09.265
of embalmed communists doesn't
get your juices flowing?

31:09.299 --> 31:11.769
Because it sure does
for me, baby. Come on.

31:11.801 --> 31:14.171
May I please have
the toilet paper?

31:15.371 --> 31:16.640
Fine.

31:23.379 --> 31:26.751
- How much you gonna need?
- Just give me the damn roll!

31:26.783 --> 31:27.752
Wait.

31:28.852 --> 31:32.122
- Can we at least pretend to have relations?
- What?

31:34.157 --> 31:35.693
They're listening.

31:38.294 --> 31:40.430
And I want to make a good
impression on the comrades.

31:42.800 --> 31:46.604
When we get back,
I am filing for divorce!

32:05.789 --> 32:09.359
Oh, you still want it? Well,
yeah, we can... we can do that.

32:10.828 --> 32:13.097
What? Oh, yeah.

32:16.233 --> 32:17.702
Yeah, do you like that?

32:19.269 --> 32:21.305
<i>Here we go. Come on.</i>

32:21.338 --> 32:23.074
Yeah. Yeah. There it is.

32:23.107 --> 32:25.376
<i>There it is. Oh.
There it is. Come on.</i>

32:25.408 --> 32:27.110
Just a little bit.
Just a little bit.

32:27.144 --> 32:29.280
Yeah, just a little.
Oh, a little more.

32:29.312 --> 32:31.114
Yeah. Harder.
Harder. Okay. Harder.

32:31.148 --> 32:33.283
Good. Give it to me.
That's good.

32:33.317 --> 32:36.153
<i>Yeah. Yeah. There it is.
Yeah, come on. Dammit, that's good.</i>

32:36.186 --> 32:38.688
That's good. Yeah, there it is.
I like it. Yeah.

32:38.722 --> 32:40.491
<i>There it is. Hold on. Hold on!</i>

32:40.523 --> 32:43.127
<i>There it is! Good!
Yeah! Yeah! Ah!</i>

32:43.159 --> 32:44.128
Yes!

32:57.573 --> 32:58.775
That man...

33:00.543 --> 33:01.545
is freak.

33:08.351 --> 33:09.553
<i>Da.</i>

33:20.196 --> 33:23.199
Her toilet paper needs
were extremely excessive.

33:23.233 --> 33:25.903
So, what's next, man?

33:25.936 --> 33:30.374
Well... I've been submitting my short
story to a number of publishers.

33:30.407 --> 33:32.810
Author. Author.

33:32.842 --> 33:36.679
Simon Schuster or Random House.

33:36.713 --> 33:38.616
Um...

33:38.648 --> 33:42.887
- not exactly.
- What if the rating thing doesn't work out?

33:42.919 --> 33:45.156
I have every confidence
that it will.

33:45.188 --> 33:48.892
Why don't you set your
sight a little lower.

33:48.926 --> 33:54.398
Lower than writing porn? Because I feel
like that's pretty sufficiently low.

33:56.733 --> 34:01.272
- I'm, uh... talking about your political gig.
- Oh, yeah.

34:01.304 --> 34:04.141
- Yeah, that's... that's... that's what I was talking about too.
- Oh.

34:07.276 --> 34:10.181
Instead of running
for governor or senator,

34:10.214 --> 34:15.418
why don't you try something more
local, like school board or...

34:15.451 --> 34:19.723
Or, I'm just spitballing
here, man, but mayor.

34:20.757 --> 34:22.826
Chunky monkey.

34:22.859 --> 34:24.795
Hey, calm down,
Jerry, calm down.

34:24.828 --> 34:28.266
Chunky monkey, Chunky monkey.

34:29.766 --> 34:32.336
What do overweight primates
have to do with anything?

34:32.368 --> 34:37.874
- Just coming up with a new flavor banana ice cream.
- Chunky monkey.

34:37.907 --> 34:39.710
Good boy, hey, good boy.

34:41.377 --> 34:46.950
Hey, if you want to run for Mayor, we
could put a petition in the ice cream shop.

34:48.284 --> 34:52.656
<i>And then Ben and...
or Jerry gave Bernie the most</i>

34:52.688 --> 34:54.891
<i>unfortunate of ideas.</i>

34:54.924 --> 34:56.259
Mayor, huh?

34:59.429 --> 35:00.697
Ice cream for monkeys.

35:02.498 --> 35:06.837
<i>And like Daisy Duck
and Donald Duck, Minnie Mouse</i>

35:06.869 --> 35:09.973
<i>was never actually married
to Mickey Mouse</i>

35:10.007 --> 35:11.809
<i>and now you know the rest...</i>

35:11.842 --> 35:13.577
That's interesting,
I didn't know that.

35:13.610 --> 35:15.946
<i>Hi, this is Burlington Mayor,
Gordon Paquette.</i>

35:15.978 --> 35:19.515
<i>It's been my pleasure to serve
you for the past decade.</i>

35:19.549 --> 35:21.552
"It's been my pleasure
to serve you for the decade."

35:21.585 --> 35:23.920
<i>We've come a long way,
but there's more to do.</i>

35:23.953 --> 35:27.657
<i>I hope I can count on your vote on
Tuesday, so we can keep making</i>

35:27.690 --> 35:30.360
<i>Burlington
the biggest city in Vermont.</i>

35:30.393 --> 35:32.428
"I hope I can count
on your vote on Tuesday."

35:32.462 --> 35:35.565
- <i>Bernie!</i>
- "Biggest city in Vermont." La-di-da.

35:35.598 --> 35:37.834
<i>Bernie!</i>

35:39.435 --> 35:41.704
- Comrade Stalin, is that you?
- <i>Oh.</i>

35:45.808 --> 35:48.978
- But how?
- <i>Air time is surprisingly expensive.</i>

35:49.011 --> 35:50.980
<i>Even in your little Vermont.</i>

35:51.014 --> 35:53.017
- <i>So, listen up.</i>
- Oh, yeah. I'm all ears.

35:53.049 --> 35:57.654
<i>Yes, sadly, this is
your order number 227.</i>

35:57.688 --> 36:01.692
Order 227? Isn't that
a little drastic?

36:01.725 --> 36:04.795
<i>You must win mayor election.</i>

36:04.828 --> 36:07.665
The guy in there now,
he's pretty solid.

36:07.697 --> 36:10.600
<i>They're traitors,
panic makers and cowards</i>

36:10.634 --> 36:15.673
<i>will be liquidated
on the spot order 227.</i>

36:15.706 --> 36:17.641
Comrade?

36:17.674 --> 36:19.442
Hello?

36:22.045 --> 36:23.380
I'm so...

36:29.085 --> 36:31.354
- Hmm?
- Good day.

36:32.755 --> 36:35.326
I'd like to get my name on the
ballot for the next mayor election.

36:36.460 --> 36:37.994
Mayoral.

36:38.027 --> 36:40.997
- Excuse me?
- It's not mayor election.

36:41.031 --> 36:44.967
- It is mayoral election.
- I stand corrected.

36:45.000 --> 36:48.339
- I bet that happens to you often.
- Not if I'm sitting down,

36:49.605 --> 36:52.375
You know, stand corrected,
sitting down?

36:52.409 --> 36:53.777
Not a fan of
public laughter, okay.

36:53.810 --> 36:56.980
So, are these signatures real

36:57.013 --> 37:00.618
or are they just people
you buy or sell dope from?

37:02.485 --> 37:03.953
Well, both.

37:06.589 --> 37:08.524
- What party?
- Communist.

37:08.558 --> 37:12.730
Oh. Not a lot of commies
elected in Vermont lately,

37:12.763 --> 37:16.967
- but hey, it's your funeral.
- No, wait, wait, wait, um, socialist.

37:18.735 --> 37:19.704
Um...

37:23.973 --> 37:25.875
in... independent?

37:29.179 --> 37:31.014
And only because you
don't have a snowball's

37:31.047 --> 37:35.085
- chance in hell of ever being elected.
- Right on!

37:35.118 --> 37:36.753
Vote for me!

37:40.022 --> 37:42.625
God help us all.

37:42.659 --> 37:45.429
<i>And Bernie caught
lightning in a bottle.</i>

37:51.034 --> 37:55.172
<i>Gordon Paquette had been
a very popular Democrat mayor</i>

37:55.205 --> 37:59.109
<i>of Burlington forever and didn't
take Bernie seriously.</i>

37:59.141 --> 38:00.810
<i>I mean, who would.</i>

38:00.844 --> 38:03.013
If you're in there,
you should vote for me!

38:08.018 --> 38:10.621
<i>A vote here. A vote there.</i>

38:10.654 --> 38:13.123
Oh my. Uh-oh.

38:13.156 --> 38:15.692
All right, I'm just gonna
leave this outside for you.

38:19.529 --> 38:22.032
Mr. Sanders. Oh, no. No, no, no.

38:22.065 --> 38:24.467
Not in the middle of the day,
the lights are on. What's gotten into you?

38:24.500 --> 38:27.703
<i>Bingo bango.
And at the age of 40,</i>

38:27.737 --> 38:34.677
<i>Bernie Sanders had his first
full-time paying job, mayor.</i>

38:34.710 --> 38:38.514
<i>♪ Won't you take me to
Funky Town ♪</i>

38:38.547 --> 38:41.851
<i>♪ Won't you take me to
Funky Town ♪</i>

38:45.087 --> 38:48.624
- What media outlet did you say it's from again?
- <i>Teen Vogue.</i>

38:48.657 --> 38:54.565
<i>Teen Vogue?</i> You're French.
That's excellent. <i>Vive La révolucion.</i>

38:54.598 --> 38:57.801
- What?
- Never mind. What do you want? What are the questions?

38:57.833 --> 39:00.670
If you were a tree,
what kind of tree would you be?

39:00.703 --> 39:02.939
If I was a tree?
What is that, a trick question?

39:02.973 --> 39:04.507
There's a lot of
trees out there.

39:08.645 --> 39:11.014
- Lemon tree.
- Why?

39:11.047 --> 39:13.884
Like Peter, Paul
and the other one said,

39:13.917 --> 39:18.489
there's a lot of lessons you can
learn from a lemon tree because...

39:18.522 --> 39:23.627
lemon tree very pretty and
the flower, oh so sweet, but...

39:23.659 --> 39:26.931
the fruit of the poor
lemon tree is impossible to eat.

39:27.964 --> 39:30.000
What does that even mean?

39:30.032 --> 39:32.969
Well, the pretty flower
represents the working man.

39:33.904 --> 39:36.840
And the lemon, the bitter
taste of capitalism.

39:36.873 --> 39:38.575
Lemon tree, final answer.

39:46.049 --> 39:50.052
Good day, I'm here to
pick up my pay check.

39:50.085 --> 39:55.625
- What are you getting paid for?
- For being mayor... of Burlington.

40:11.174 --> 40:13.877
Wait, wait, wait a second.

40:13.909 --> 40:18.080
This isn't going to
bounce, is it?

40:18.114 --> 40:21.284
Not if people
pay their taxes, no.

40:21.317 --> 40:23.586
Rest assured.

40:24.621 --> 40:28.092
Taxes... will be paid.

40:30.594 --> 40:31.762
Wonderful.

40:32.795 --> 40:35.698
Just wonderful. Just...

40:36.600 --> 40:37.900
...wonderful.

40:37.933 --> 40:39.735
My constituents,

40:39.768 --> 40:42.171
as your elected representative,

40:42.205 --> 40:47.277
I can assure you labors rights,
managements rights...

40:47.310 --> 40:48.645
I'm strictly neutral.

41:03.759 --> 41:06.964
Mr. Mayor, how's it hanging?

41:06.996 --> 41:09.866
Uh, low and loose. Hazel!

41:09.898 --> 41:11.801
- Your secretary?
- That's right.

41:11.835 --> 41:14.204
She said to tell you
she went to lunch.

41:16.272 --> 41:17.473
Well, as soon as she gets back,

41:17.507 --> 41:20.043
you can go ahead and make an
appointment with her to see me

41:20.076 --> 41:22.646
because as you know,
my door is always open.

41:22.679 --> 41:24.247
Now, if you'll excuse me,

41:24.279 --> 41:26.616
I have a very important
mayor business to attend to.

41:31.755 --> 41:33.123
Something on your mind?

41:34.257 --> 41:36.827
- Is it true what they say?
- Depends on what they're saying.

41:38.094 --> 41:39.128
What are they saying?

41:40.263 --> 41:43.900
You got one of them blood pacts
with that Chinaman,

41:43.933 --> 41:47.737
- Mao Zebradong.
- Mao? No, I assure you, sir,

41:47.770 --> 41:50.306
that I have a blood pact with a
completely different communist.

41:50.339 --> 41:52.975
Now, if you'll excuse me,
now that we sorted that out,

41:53.009 --> 41:54.777
I have mayor business
to attend to.

42:00.449 --> 42:02.319
- Parking ticket?
- Good eye.

42:03.420 --> 42:06.790
I assure you, I am far too busy
to deal with things like this.

42:06.822 --> 42:10.359
The last guy had plenty of time to
take care of these particular matters.

42:10.393 --> 42:13.295
- So what? That was him, this is me.
- And how long was he mayor?

42:13.328 --> 42:14.831
I don't know, a long time.

42:19.935 --> 42:25.241
- All right, I'll take a look at it.
- Much appreciated.

42:25.275 --> 42:27.244
All right.
Now, if you'll excuse me.

42:36.018 --> 42:40.290
Hazel, no more
constituents today.

42:49.232 --> 42:53.136
<i>Bernie is now the mayor
of the biggest city in Vermont.</i>

42:53.168 --> 42:57.741
<i>If you consider 40,000 people
big, he was making bank.</i>

43:00.375 --> 43:01.344
Sales tax...

43:06.915 --> 43:10.086
<i>All was not
right in Bernieville.</i>

43:20.462 --> 43:22.865
Commander Stalin.

43:22.898 --> 43:24.467
You were expecting Avon lady?

43:25.902 --> 43:29.773
Bernie, being mayor of
a small city is peanuts.

43:29.806 --> 43:30.941
You can do better.

43:32.107 --> 43:33.476
What could be
better than being Mayor.

43:33.509 --> 43:35.878
If I could kill 20 million
of my countrymen,

43:35.911 --> 43:39.348
the least you could do is get
your sorry butt to Washington.

43:39.382 --> 43:42.018
Washington... D.C.?

43:42.051 --> 43:45.422
No, Washington, Iowa.
Of course Washington, D.C.

43:45.455 --> 43:49.226
Now get your ass to Washington
and do what you said you would do.

43:49.259 --> 43:52.128
- We have a blood oath.
- Yeah.

43:52.161 --> 43:53.362
How?

43:54.831 --> 43:56.233
How?

43:56.266 --> 43:58.836
- <i>Blood oath!</i>
- How?

44:02.237 --> 44:04.340
How?

44:09.112 --> 44:11.481
I'm going to run for Congress.

44:11.514 --> 44:15.852
Sexual Congress? Pretty sure you
don't have to run for that, man.

44:15.884 --> 44:18.120
- Unless you're desperate.
- What?

44:18.154 --> 44:20.190
No.

44:20.223 --> 44:22.324
United States Congress. Damn it.

44:22.357 --> 44:24.160
Oh, I don't know
about that, Bernie.

44:25.261 --> 44:28.031
How about you call me Mr. Mayor,
because you know,

44:28.063 --> 44:31.167
- people are calling me that nowadays.
- Wavy gravy.

44:31.201 --> 44:33.869
Wavy... gravy.

44:33.902 --> 44:36.305
- We gonna do something about that?
- Wavy gravy!

44:36.339 --> 44:41.110
- It's his process, man.
- Alright, alright. So, where are we on me running for Congress.

44:41.143 --> 44:43.846
Oh, I don't know, the Republican
that's in there right now

44:43.880 --> 44:45.916
- is pretty solid.
- Solid shmolid.

44:45.949 --> 44:48.217
Why you so hot about it, man?

44:48.250 --> 44:51.187
Last night I got a visit

44:51.221 --> 44:55.926
from Ioseb Besarionis
dze Jughashvili.

44:55.958 --> 45:00.397
- Please don't tell me you're talking to Stalin again!
- Shh. Not so loud.

45:00.429 --> 45:03.265
- Okay. Okay.
- Did you know

45:03.299 --> 45:06.969
that congressmen make
$74,000 a year?

45:07.002 --> 45:09.972
- They get a huge expense account.
- Dude.

45:10.005 --> 45:12.408
Right... Mr. Mayor. Please.

45:12.442 --> 45:18.315
- You in it for the money or to help the people, man?
- Wavy gravy.

45:18.348 --> 45:19.416
Wavy gravy.

45:20.884 --> 45:24.154
Wavy gravy. Wavy Gravy!

45:24.186 --> 45:29.025
Damn it, Jerry. You said you
weren't gonna drop acid again, man!

45:30.293 --> 45:33.163
Why can't it be about the money
and help with the oppressed?

45:34.063 --> 45:37.067
Because they can't
exist together.

45:38.000 --> 45:40.569
Hey, vote for me. Come on.

45:40.603 --> 45:42.973
<i>Like a menu
in a Chinese restaurant,</i>

45:43.005 --> 45:45.908
<i>Bernie took
a little from column A</i>

45:45.942 --> 45:50.045
<i>and B, and he ran for congress.</i>

45:50.078 --> 45:54.650
- Care to buy a poppy?
- Oh, no, no. I'm not a big believer in terrorists.

45:54.683 --> 46:01.457
But, uh, however, I do like poppies
for, uh, for other reasons.

46:01.491 --> 46:05.896
You do understand you can't smoke these
poppies, because I get that a lot.

46:05.929 --> 46:08.532
Oh, my mistake. Well then...

46:10.132 --> 46:12.168
good luck to you
and your needy people, sir.

46:17.639 --> 46:22.244
I promise that if you elect me to represent you in Washington,

46:22.277 --> 46:27.484
I will force all wealthy people to pay
at least 100% of their income in taxes

46:27.516 --> 46:33.489
and also make them work in factories
or possibly even salt mines.

46:33.522 --> 46:35.357
Are there any questions?

46:35.391 --> 46:37.694
- I was told there would be donuts.
- No, there are no donuts.

46:37.726 --> 46:39.495
Any other questions?

46:41.496 --> 46:42.665
Okay.

46:48.003 --> 46:53.208
- So, did you enjoy my speech?
- It was okay, I guess.

46:53.241 --> 46:58.414
Then perhaps you'd like to come over to my walk-up apartment

46:58.447 --> 47:03.219
and check out my copy of <i>Das Kapital?</i>
It's a first edition.

47:03.252 --> 47:04.388
Yeah, you gotta be kidding me.

47:13.763 --> 47:17.634
What did you think of my speech?

47:18.768 --> 47:20.136
Okay.

47:23.639 --> 47:27.143
<i>Polls just in
for the congressional race puts</i>

47:27.176 --> 47:30.714
<i>Republican Peter Smith at 72%.</i>

47:30.746 --> 47:34.384
<i>Burlington Mayor
Bernie Sanders at 15%.</i>

47:34.417 --> 47:37.987
<i>And I Don't Remotely
Care at 10%.</i>

47:40.288 --> 47:42.558
Look, it's not that I don't agree
with your position on the issue,

47:42.592 --> 47:47.030
but I think you might want to consider
toning down the rhetoric about

47:47.063 --> 47:49.366
rounding up rich people
to work in the salt mines.

47:49.398 --> 47:56.505
Wait, so you're saying that people don't
want the rich working in salt mines?

47:56.538 --> 48:00.243
- Pretty much. Yeah.
- Playing the happy game.

48:00.275 --> 48:03.178
At least you're polling a little
higher than I Don't Remotely Care.

48:03.212 --> 48:07.317
Guys, what am I gonna do? I gave up
the mayor's job to run for Congress.

48:07.350 --> 48:10.420
There's always your
porn writing career and

48:10.453 --> 48:13.590
- public assistance.
- Territory you know well.

48:13.623 --> 48:17.793

Always go with your strong suit.

48:33.442 --> 48:37.179
- You have a higher calling, my son.
- What is it?

48:38.114 --> 48:42.284
- What is my higher calling?
- It rhymes with "battery."

48:43.386 --> 48:45.188
Cattery?

48:45.221 --> 48:46.188
Cattery?

48:47.355 --> 48:50.426
- Cattery?
- I don't even have any cats, I'm allergic.

48:50.460 --> 48:52.195
Anarchy.

48:52.228 --> 48:54.097
Your higher calling is anarchy

48:54.130 --> 48:57.200
and taking down
capitalism. Sheesh!

48:57.232 --> 48:59.735
No disrespect but, uh...

48:59.768 --> 49:03.172
battery doesn't exactly
rhyme with anarchy, so...

49:03.206 --> 49:05.275
- You dare to question me?
- No, I'm...

49:05.308 --> 49:07.409
- You want to go to Gulag?
- I don't want to go to Gulag.

49:07.442 --> 49:10.345
- You are going to be in Gulag so fast.
- Please don't put me in Gulag.

49:10.378 --> 49:13.549
Don't... don't want to be in Gulag.

49:14.516 --> 49:17.386
Dude. Are you okay?

49:18.621 --> 49:20.490
Yeah.

49:20.522 --> 49:21.624
Yeah.

49:22.657 --> 49:24.627
- Yeah.
- Massive flashback.

49:24.659 --> 49:26.529
- Cool.
- Yeah, what were we talking about?

49:28.264 --> 49:30.600
What you're going
to do next, man.

49:30.632 --> 49:31.701
Right.

49:32.668 --> 49:38.208
So, what is it,
back to the writing thing?

49:38.241 --> 49:41.610
Yeah. Um, yeah, I do love
that bondage fantasy piece

49:41.643 --> 49:43.612
that people seem to really like.

49:43.645 --> 49:45.714
There you go. Fly, Bernie.

49:46.781 --> 49:48.717
- Fly.
- Yeah.

49:48.750 --> 49:51.186
But fate
intervened and Bernie didn't

49:51.219 --> 49:53.456
need to rely on writing porn.

49:54.456 --> 49:57.560
So there was an assassination
attempt on President Reagan.

49:57.592 --> 50:02.297
And in the ensuing backlash,
Congress proposed gun control called

50:02.331 --> 50:05.602
the Brady Bill. The incumbent
Vermont Congressman,

50:05.634 --> 50:09.371
a republican no less,
voted for the bill.

50:09.404 --> 50:11.740
<i>♪ This is my country
my damn country ♪</i>

50:11.773 --> 50:14.377
<i>♪ Give me my country

50:14.409 --> 50:16.913

50:22.284 --> 50:24.888
<i>♪ Then take off your boots
you rhinestone frog ♪</i>

50:39.601 --> 50:44.440
In fact, Vermonters love
their guns, even the hippies.

50:44.473 --> 50:47.610
And they're not inclined to vote
for someone who wants to restrict

50:47.643 --> 50:50.547
their second amendment
rights. Quite right.

50:50.580 --> 50:51.915
Yee-haw!

50:51.947 --> 50:53.750
I sure do love guns.

50:53.782 --> 50:57.286
Woo! Woo-hoo!

50:57.319 --> 51:00.289
<i>♪ So then it don't mean a thing

51:00.322 --> 51:02.725

<i>♪ Just keep your hands off my country

51:21.344 --> 51:23.780
Well, you know,
you get the picture.

51:23.813 --> 51:28.751
Bernie frigging Sanders becomes
a United States Congressman.

51:28.784 --> 51:31.654
Woah! Let's all
dance to that one.

51:31.686 --> 51:37.527
Yes. Think about it. Congressman
Sanders, let it sink in.

51:39.494 --> 51:40.862
So.

51:40.895 --> 51:43.398
What's the Washington plan, man?

51:43.431 --> 51:46.502
Well, I'm thinking
that I lay low.

51:49.871 --> 51:53.342
Wait for the country to
come unravelled economically.

51:53.375 --> 51:56.345
And then launch my plan
with Soviet-style Socialism.

51:56.378 --> 51:58.848
- Communism.
- Socialism.

51:58.880 --> 52:02.551
I thought we've been talking about
from each according to their ability,

52:02.585 --> 52:04.686
- to each according to their need.
- No.

52:04.719 --> 52:07.857
come on, man. It's all about the
redistribution of wealth, man.

52:07.889 --> 52:09.958
I mean, we've been
talking about this for a while.

52:09.991 --> 52:13.462
- No, Ben, trust me on this one.
- Don't cave into the establishment.

52:13.496 --> 52:16.599
Trust me on this one.
If we call it Communism,

52:16.632 --> 52:19.002
then all the people that
we're trying to quietly co-opt

52:19.034 --> 52:20.869
are gonna go running
for the hills.

52:20.902 --> 52:24.406
Okay, but aren't Vermonters

52:24.440 --> 52:27.277
gonna expect you to pass
legislation in the meantime?

52:28.310 --> 52:33.315
Vermonters think that I'm a gun guy.
So that's gonna buy me plenty of time.

52:33.348 --> 52:35.651
Shotgun sherbert.

52:37.386 --> 52:39.755
- So, guys.
- Yeah.

52:39.788 --> 52:40.991
Come here.

52:42.058 --> 52:43.693
Yeah.

52:43.726 --> 52:45.862
Yeah.

52:48.998 --> 52:52.335
So. Now that
I'm a congressman...

52:53.636 --> 52:55.338
how about a little...

52:56.739 --> 52:59.042
- consideration.
- Consideration?

52:59.074 --> 53:01.343
Yeah, you know, just a little
bit of cash to help with

53:01.377 --> 53:03.013
the expenses moving
to Washington.

53:04.547 --> 53:06.849
Bernie, doesn't
the government pay for that?

53:06.882 --> 53:09.585
Well, yeah, but you know,

53:09.618 --> 53:11.420
this isn't that.

53:13.022 --> 53:16.525
You know, I may be
in a position...

53:18.060 --> 53:23.099
where I could help two certain ice
cream manufacturers with some, you know,

53:23.132 --> 53:25.501
certain national
distribution issues.

53:25.534 --> 53:30.340
- Is this a shakedown?
- Shakedown sorbet.

53:30.373 --> 53:34.411
No, it's just a little...
consideration.

53:35.777 --> 53:40.515
Well, then... I'll consider it.

53:40.549 --> 53:43.719
Cool. Yeah. Okay.

53:43.752 --> 53:49.891
Well, as you guys know,
I hate rich people.

53:49.924 --> 53:54.830
- Man.
- I hate rich people. Not that you guys are rich.

53:56.699 --> 53:58.401
Don't make me hate you too.

54:08.411 --> 54:14.050
- Look for a wavy gravy container in your mailbox.
- Good. Good, very good. Good.

54:19.922 --> 54:21.557
We've created a monster.

54:21.589 --> 54:27.562
Yeah, monster marshmallow mash.

54:27.596 --> 54:29.766
- Home run, man.
- Bro.

54:33.536 --> 54:35.104
- Yeah.
- That turned the day around.

54:35.136 --> 54:36.037
Yeah, it did.

55:05.835 --> 55:09.139
Hey,
it's the commie from Vermont!

55:10.672 --> 55:12.141
Oh, hey, Bernie.

55:13.174 --> 55:15.944
- What you writing?
- Just authoring some legislation.

55:15.978 --> 55:18.447
- No, no, really, what you got there?
- No, come on, give it back.

55:18.480 --> 55:21.450
Give it back!
Hey. Hey! That's important.

55:21.484 --> 55:27.190
Whoa. "I held
her down and she resisted,

55:27.223 --> 55:29.159
but I knew she wasn't into it."

55:31.060 --> 55:36.433
Holy shit, your legislation
is a bondage fantasy?

55:40.902 --> 55:43.672
You are gross, Sanders.

55:45.206 --> 55:47.542
I'd like to
get me a piece of that.

55:49.043 --> 55:51.614
Someday <i>I'm</i> going
to be in charge.

55:52.547 --> 55:55.051
Then you're going to be
first in the Gulag, first.

55:56.985 --> 55:59.022
Ow!

56:01.723 --> 56:03.926
This is no good,

56:03.958 --> 56:06.161
when I'm looking at this,
it's not going to work.

56:06.194 --> 56:10.732
I mean, we're polling
terrible with African Americans,

56:10.766 --> 56:14.938
With the pipe fitters, and with
rational adults over the age of 30.

56:16.138 --> 56:18.206
This is problem why?

56:18.239 --> 56:20.275
Because the pipe fitters
are my pathway to victory.

56:20.308 --> 56:21.543
Mm...

56:24.580 --> 56:26.815
- We kill all pipe fitters.
- What?

56:26.848 --> 56:30.252
Yeah. Round them up.

56:30.286 --> 56:33.589
Yeah, but they can't vote for me
if they're...

56:35.824 --> 56:40.296
Of course dead men can vote.
Why you think your JFK becomes president?

56:40.328 --> 56:44.734
Well, fair enough, but let's just...
let's put a pin in that for now.

56:44.766 --> 56:47.837
- Or a six inch stiletto.
- Yeah. No, wait. No. No, no.

56:47.869 --> 56:51.040
Just spitballing here.
Just spitballing here.

56:52.141 --> 56:53.877
How about...

56:54.909 --> 57:00.049
we round up all political
prisoners and put them in Gulag.

57:00.081 --> 57:02.752
Um... I... I like
where you're heading.

57:02.784 --> 57:08.723
However, let's... let's not put the prison
camps in front of the horse quite yet.

57:08.757 --> 57:12.195
Hmm. Fine. Bernie knows best.

57:14.596 --> 57:15.730
Yeah.

57:30.346 --> 57:32.748
<i>Feeling
lonely and disillusioned,</i>

57:32.781 --> 57:36.719
<i>Bernie made friends with someone
who could help him with inclusion.</i>

57:51.400 --> 57:53.802
It's not easy being
the newbie, is it?

57:53.835 --> 57:56.839
No. No, if I'm being
totally honest? No, it's not.

57:59.007 --> 58:00.676
You know...

58:00.708 --> 58:04.946
Tom Foley made me do
a Kabuki dance in front of

58:04.980 --> 58:09.752
the entire house leadership.
My freshman year.

58:11.052 --> 58:14.123
One time I had to do an Irish
jig in front of the entire

58:14.156 --> 58:17.259
Burlington Lions Club,
so, you know, I feel your pain.

58:19.395 --> 58:22.732
- Things we have to do to get elected.
- Yeah. Yeah.

58:25.333 --> 58:27.036
I like you, honey.

58:28.337 --> 58:30.339
Where did you say
you were from again?

58:30.371 --> 58:33.676
Vermont.
It's... it's, Bernie, by the way.

58:33.708 --> 58:35.043
- Vermont?
- Yeah.

58:35.076 --> 58:36.645
Where the hell is that?

58:36.679 --> 58:38.814
It's basically East New York.

58:38.846 --> 58:41.049
Do you? You really like me?

58:43.018 --> 58:45.221
Let me give you
a little advice, Ernie.

58:45.253 --> 58:49.424
Play your cards right
and you can do real well here.

58:49.458 --> 58:54.864
- Yeah, how's that?
- Well... let's just say

58:55.797 --> 59:02.037
I put down a down payment on a
kick-ass mansion in Los Angeles

59:02.071 --> 59:04.906
with a damn fine swimming pool.

59:07.042 --> 59:08.210
You know...

59:09.844 --> 59:11.647
money is in the Senate.

59:13.815 --> 59:16.384
Huh. How big is your mansion?

59:19.487 --> 59:21.424
<i>And Bernie would get his help.</i>

59:21.456 --> 59:26.295
<i>Vermont's Republican Senator
decided not to run again.</i>

59:26.328 --> 59:31.132
<i>Seeing an opening, Bernie ran for senate.
And despite not having passed</i>

59:31.165 --> 59:34.436
<i>one single piece of
legislation as a congressman,</i>

59:34.469 --> 59:38.873
<i>Bernie Sanders was elected
to the United States Senate.</i>

59:38.906 --> 59:43.845
<i>Which begs the question,
are all Vermonters on drugs?</i>

59:50.284 --> 59:51.353
Ha-ha!

59:53.188 --> 59:54.724
Very mature.

1:00:10.272 --> 1:00:12.875
Ooh!

1:00:17.279 --> 1:00:21.050
<i>Hi, my name is Jane.
My perfect man is someone</i>

1:00:21.083 --> 1:00:24.286
<i>who would not want to be checking
all of his wife's bank forms</i>

1:00:24.319 --> 1:00:29.491
and accounting records and such
things, and is up for cashing in.

1:00:29.525 --> 1:00:32.360
Not picky about looks
but a disheveled man

1:00:32.393 --> 1:00:34.730
is a turn-on.

1:00:39.601 --> 1:00:43.438
And by the authority vested
in me by the state of Vermont,

1:00:43.471 --> 1:00:47.475
I now pronounce you
man and wife.

1:00:47.509 --> 1:00:51.280
Or whatever you identify as.

1:00:55.417 --> 1:00:59.855
We're going with Manchurian
Candidate and wife.

1:01:02.357 --> 1:01:03.793
You may kiss the bride.

1:01:05.127 --> 1:01:08.029
<i>Flush with marital
bliss, the new Mrs. Sanders</i>

1:01:08.063 --> 1:01:11.032
<i>set out to do exactly
what her dating profile said.</i>

1:01:11.065 --> 1:01:16.105
<i>She became the President of
Burlington College, and quickly put</i>

1:01:16.138 --> 1:01:17.906
<i>the institution out of business.</i>

1:01:17.940 --> 1:01:18.907
Gross.

1:01:23.011 --> 1:01:26.482
<i>And fulfilling his
part of the Faustian bargain,</i>

1:01:26.514 --> 1:01:29.551
<i>Bernie decided
to run for president.</i>

1:01:29.585 --> 1:01:31.086
<i>I mean, why not?</i>

1:01:31.118 --> 1:01:33.021
And so today,

1:01:33.054 --> 1:01:34.857
I announce my candidacy for

1:01:34.889 --> 1:01:38.393
the office of
Chief amongst equals.

1:01:38.427 --> 1:01:41.964
I mean, President
of the United States.

1:01:41.996 --> 1:01:45.400
Woo! Presidential
pistachio pudding.

1:01:45.433 --> 1:01:48.536
Oh! Ben, can you do
something about that?

1:01:48.569 --> 1:01:51.206
- All you got to do is ask, man.
- Come on!

1:01:51.239 --> 1:01:54.542
- Geez! Well, where was I?
- Heads up!

1:01:54.576 --> 1:01:56.978
Oh, geez. What's going on here?

1:01:58.013 --> 1:02:02.116
Oh, lovely looking group here
this morning, really nice.

1:02:02.150 --> 1:02:07.223
And by the way, if you can send a few dollars
to Bernie Sanders, I would appreciate it.

1:02:21.569 --> 1:02:23.038
Morning, Seattle!

1:02:24.473 --> 1:02:26.141
I want to thank you all
for being the most...

1:02:26.174 --> 1:02:27.942
You better get up there, girl.

1:02:27.976 --> 1:02:30.579
- Get up there and let him know!
- Black lives matter!

1:02:30.612 --> 1:02:32.081
Black lives matter!

1:02:32.114 --> 1:02:33.882
Pretty damn good coffee too.

1:02:33.915 --> 1:02:35.316
Progressive my ass.

1:02:35.350 --> 1:02:37.485
You just as racist
as the rest of America.

1:02:37.518 --> 1:02:39.154
We ain't doing
this today, Bernie.

1:02:39.186 --> 1:02:41.022
- No?
- No, we're not listening to

1:02:41.056 --> 1:02:42.891
no more kooky crap.

1:02:42.924 --> 1:02:44.893
Black lives matter.

1:02:44.927 --> 1:02:47.563
- I want my microphone back.
- No. It's a new day.

1:02:47.596 --> 1:02:49.197
- Give me my microphone.
- Black lives matter!

1:02:49.230 --> 1:02:51.132
Black lives matter!

1:02:51.165 --> 1:02:52.934
Black lives matter!

1:02:52.967 --> 1:02:54.670
- Give me my microphone.
- Black lives matter!

1:02:54.703 --> 1:02:57.273
Black lives matter, Bernie!

1:02:57.306 --> 1:02:58.641
I paid for that microphone!

1:02:58.674 --> 1:03:02.478
The taxpayers paid
for this microphone.

1:03:02.511 --> 1:03:04.446
- No!
- Black lives matter!

1:03:04.478 --> 1:03:06.348
Black lives matter!

1:03:06.380 --> 1:03:09.984
Black lives matter!
Black lives matter!

1:03:10.018 --> 1:03:14.188
Black lives matter!
Black lives matter!

1:03:14.221 --> 1:03:17.525
Black lives matter!
Black lives matter!

1:03:20.027 --> 1:03:23.331
I'm thinking...
next time I use one of those

1:03:23.364 --> 1:03:27.502
megaphones 'cause, you know,
the harder the steel.

1:03:27.536 --> 1:03:31.407
You should have gotten
the damn mic back, Bernie!

1:03:31.440 --> 1:03:35.210
In my defence, she was
a very large woman.

1:03:35.243 --> 1:03:41.250
Look, I didn't sign up
to be first lady of loser!

1:03:44.386 --> 1:03:45.955
Figure it out!

1:03:47.422 --> 1:03:51.359
<i>Despite Bernie's rocky
start in his tenuous relationships with</i>

1:03:51.393 --> 1:03:57.599
<i>the black community, lo and behold,
Bernie started to win primaries,</i>

1:03:57.632 --> 1:04:02.738
<i>much to the consternation
of you know who.</i>

1:04:02.770 --> 1:04:07.208
So, what will it take for you to cool
your socialist jets and endorse me.

1:04:07.241 --> 1:04:10.178
I am not for sale.

1:04:11.612 --> 1:04:14.282
- Of course you are.
- She's negotiating,

1:04:14.315 --> 1:04:16.484
and, ooh, that's hot.

1:04:16.518 --> 1:04:22.057
- Don't you let her push you around, Bernie!
- Me, Tarzan. You, Jane.

1:04:22.089 --> 1:04:26.694
- Huh?
- You're the media buyer for your husband's campaign, right?

1:04:26.728 --> 1:04:30.699
- How do you know?
- Like all media buyers, you get ten percent of the ads

1:04:30.732 --> 1:04:33.335
- you place.
- No comment.

1:04:33.368 --> 1:04:38.507
Mr. Feel The Burn here has spent a
hundred million in placed ads so far.

1:04:38.540 --> 1:04:44.313
- That's ten million in commissions.
- I'm not that good at math.

1:04:44.346 --> 1:04:48.784
So, riddle me this, Jane,
what happened to your ten mil commission?

1:04:48.817 --> 1:04:54.123
Is it buried under a rock in your
backyard next to your bogarted stash?

1:04:56.157 --> 1:04:59.060
You can name your price
or you can be found by

1:04:59.094 --> 1:05:01.230
the park police
next to the cannon.

1:05:01.263 --> 1:05:05.601
Yeah, but that's the one,
that gets them every time.

1:05:05.634 --> 1:05:08.804
This fosters the gift
that keeps on giving.

1:05:08.837 --> 1:05:12.107
So, Comrade, what is it?

1:05:12.139 --> 1:05:16.377
All right. All right.
Hypothetically speaking,

1:05:16.411 --> 1:05:20.749
if there were a boss vacation
home at Lake Champlain

1:05:20.781 --> 1:05:23.084
that should happen
to come our way,

1:05:23.118 --> 1:05:26.587
just maybe, maybe, I don't know,
maybe I should retire to that place.

1:05:26.621 --> 1:05:29.291
A lake house? That's it?

1:05:29.324 --> 1:05:32.061
Really? Talk about a cheap date.

1:05:32.094 --> 1:05:36.197
And we want an Audi
A8 sports car.

1:05:36.230 --> 1:05:39.634
I'm sick and tired of driving
that piece of crap Prius.

1:05:39.668 --> 1:05:42.538
That Audi is a bona fide
pussy magnet.

1:05:42.571 --> 1:05:47.342
- Trust me. I got me one too.
- Shut up, Bill.

1:05:47.375 --> 1:05:51.612
Sure enough. See, our
relationship is complicated.

1:05:51.645 --> 1:05:55.484
I want an endorsement statement
from your campaign tomorrow.

1:05:55.516 --> 1:06:01.522
- You'll get your endorsement when I see the goods.
- Don't mess with me, Bernie.

1:06:01.556 --> 1:06:07.329
I will be President of all the
land, except for the deplorables.

1:06:07.362 --> 1:06:11.233
And I will kick your little commie
ass from here to Des Moines.

1:06:11.266 --> 1:06:16.105
And she will, if you don't
believe me, ask Joe Biden.

1:06:16.138 --> 1:06:18.873
You'll make better care for all

1:06:18.906 --> 1:06:24.779
part of your platform and
campaign in Wisconsin and Ohio.

1:06:24.813 --> 1:06:29.518
Sure, Bernie, Whatever you say.

1:06:29.551 --> 1:06:32.321

The masked wonder is here!

1:07:25.373 --> 1:07:27.442
Oh, Bernie, would you knock it off?

1:07:27.475 --> 1:07:29.244
I'm not in the mood.

1:07:32.846 --> 1:07:36.217
Burlington College is bankrupt.

1:07:36.250 --> 1:07:41.956
- So?
- "So?" So, unlike you, <i>I'm</i> president of something.

1:07:41.989 --> 1:07:46.661
- So?
- So, I followed your Venezuela financing plan.

1:07:46.694 --> 1:07:48.596
Venezuela?

1:07:48.630 --> 1:07:50.666
Burlington College is finished.

1:07:50.699 --> 1:07:52.534
And you said it
would all work out.

1:07:52.567 --> 1:07:55.237
- Did you use other people's money?
- Of course!

1:07:55.270 --> 1:07:57.973
- People's Bank.
- There you go.

1:07:58.005 --> 1:08:00.208
You did it wrong.

1:08:00.241 --> 1:08:03.477
- What?
- Yes, you should never use the bank's money

1:08:03.511 --> 1:08:05.313
when you can use
the taxpayer's money.

1:08:05.346 --> 1:08:11.386
- Oh, so it's my fault.
- You said that, I didn't.

1:08:11.418 --> 1:08:14.723
You know what, Bernie? I think you
should run for president again.

1:08:17.625 --> 1:08:19.727
Hillary said
she'd kill me if I did.

1:08:21.362 --> 1:08:23.566
And I think she means it.

1:08:25.566 --> 1:08:27.835
I'm willing to take that chance.

1:08:30.271 --> 1:08:31.339
Huh.

1:08:41.715 --> 1:08:45.753
<i>I would just like to
say, I totally hate rich people.</i>

1:08:45.786 --> 1:08:48.490
<i>And I would just like to say...</i>

1:08:48.522 --> 1:08:51.493
<i>uh, and I would
just like to say...</i>

1:08:53.527 --> 1:08:55.429
<i>I totally hate rich people?</i>

1:08:55.463 --> 1:08:59.735
<i>Poor Bernie.
He lost his way again.</i>

1:09:00.834 --> 1:09:05.540
I've done everything that I can.
I thought there would be more chicks.

1:09:06.907 --> 1:09:11.946
I got nothing, Comrade Stalin.

1:09:13.847 --> 1:09:16.284
I'm taking a lot
of crap out here.

1:09:17.485 --> 1:09:18.954
A little help would be nice.

1:09:18.986 --> 1:09:21.022
<i>What is it? What is
my higher calling?</i>

1:09:21.056 --> 1:09:25.460
Anarchy. Your higher
calling is anarchy

1:09:25.493 --> 1:09:27.830
and taking down capitalism.

1:09:37.806 --> 1:09:43.044
<i>I promise that I will force all wealthy
people to pay 100% of their income in taxes.</i>

1:09:44.913 --> 1:09:47.449
<i>And to possibly also
work in factories.</i>

1:09:49.017 --> 1:09:51.720
<i>Or maybe even salt mines.</i>

1:09:51.753 --> 1:09:55.456
<i>Bernie was once again all
the rage with the young socialist crowd,</i>

1:09:55.490 --> 1:10:00.728
<i>and quickly gained the attention of
a like-minded rising political star.</i>

1:10:00.762 --> 1:10:04.066
Are you f###### kidding?

1:10:10.739 --> 1:10:14.875
Yes, Jane. I understand.
The College is bankrupt.

1:10:14.909 --> 1:10:17.512
There's nothing I can do about that from here.

1:10:17.544 --> 1:10:20.748
Listen. Oh. Somebody's here. I must go.

1:10:20.781 --> 1:10:22.383
Must go.

1:10:22.417 --> 1:10:25.620
Miss Ocasio Cortez,
pleasure to meet you.

1:10:25.652 --> 1:10:28.757
- Likewise, I'm sure.
- Take a load off.

1:10:32.826 --> 1:10:37.598
So... here we are, two people of
different generations trying to take

1:10:37.632 --> 1:10:40.502
the country downtown
to Socialism Town, <i>corillo.</i>

1:10:40.535 --> 1:10:42.471
Sure. Sure.

1:10:42.504 --> 1:10:44.606
Together we can make history.

1:10:44.638 --> 1:10:47.542
Ah. I understand that you
were a bartender before.

1:10:47.575 --> 1:10:49.645
- That's right.
- Well...

1:10:51.044 --> 1:10:54.048
can we discuss something
that has been on my mind

1:10:54.081 --> 1:10:56.651
- for quite a while now.
- Climate change.

1:10:56.683 --> 1:10:57.619
Huh?

1:10:58.520 --> 1:11:00.455
Income inequality.

1:11:00.487 --> 1:11:03.023
- How do you make a Manhattan?
- Excuse me?

1:11:03.057 --> 1:11:07.562
Yeah, I've always been confused,
do you use whiskey or bourbon?

1:11:07.594 --> 1:11:10.030
I can't believe you
just asked me that.

1:11:10.063 --> 1:11:11.432
It's always confused me.

1:11:12.200 --> 1:11:14.703
- That is totally a lit question.
- Lit.

1:11:14.736 --> 1:11:17.038
People often say that you could
use bourbon or Canadian whiskey,

1:11:17.070 --> 1:11:19.073
but you really have
to use rye whiskey.

1:11:19.106 --> 1:11:21.909
Otherwise you're mixing up a whack
insult to a proper Manhattan.

1:11:21.942 --> 1:11:24.178
Well, that answers
that question, thank you.

1:11:24.212 --> 1:11:26.615
And I like to make sure that
the orange peels and bitters

1:11:26.647 --> 1:11:29.517
- are good and smushed up in the bottom of the glass.
- Smushed. Yes.

1:11:29.551 --> 1:11:33.754
- Oh, and make sure you pour the sweet vermouth slowly.
- Slowly. Got it.

1:11:33.788 --> 1:11:37.459
And I can't stress this enough, but
don't over shake the whiskey and vermouth

1:11:37.491 --> 1:11:40.962
once it's in the ice, because if you over
shake it, it will dilute the whole thing.

1:11:40.995 --> 1:11:45.634
I'm totally against diluting, just tell
the greedy corporations about that!

1:11:45.667 --> 1:11:47.201
- Oh. Oh. Oh. Oh. And...
- What, for God sakes.

1:11:47.235 --> 1:11:49.638
One more thing, people often
mistake a Manhattan

1:11:49.670 --> 1:11:52.039
- with an Old Fashioned.
- And this is an issue for you?

1:11:52.072 --> 1:11:55.910
It's a tragic mistake because a Manhattan
is sweetened with sweet vermouth

1:11:55.944 --> 1:11:58.847
and an Old Fashioned
is sweetened with sugar. Yuck.

1:11:58.879 --> 1:12:01.182
- Uh, Bernie?
- Oh, look. The cat video.

1:12:01.215 --> 1:12:04.186
Aw, that's so cute.

1:12:10.023 --> 1:12:12.828
So, there you have it.

1:12:12.861 --> 1:12:17.766
A tale so curious
it may seem quite spurious.

1:12:17.798 --> 1:12:22.003
Do as you want, do as you
hunch, but please remember...

1:12:23.004 --> 1:12:28.710
there's no such thing
as a free lunch. Chin-chin.

1:12:34.615 --> 1:12:37.151
I hope he enjoys
his lakeside house.

1:12:38.052 --> 1:12:42.191
Maybe I'll get an invite.
What a bastard, eh?

1:12:43.124 --> 1:12:48.196
And he's got this wonderful private
bank in the south of France, I hear.

1:12:48.228 --> 1:12:51.467
But probably just a rumor.
Lights out.

1:13:12.253 --> 1:13:14.255
Oi, oi!

1:13:14.289 --> 1:13:15.757
Got what you asked for.

1:13:18.293 --> 1:13:21.862
I need a drink. Proper
Manhattan coming right up.

1:13:27.735 --> 1:13:29.004
Here.

1:13:30.004 --> 1:13:31.606
That's a bag of dirt.

1:13:31.638 --> 1:13:34.543
Yep. I dug it up just
like you told me to.

<i>♪ ...move to a town

1:13:38.579 --> 1:13:40.948
I have to put dirt

Oh, I got that too.
And for future reference,

1:13:43.918 --> 1:13:46.054
it's actually
opposition research.

1:13:46.087 --> 1:13:52.160
Yeah. Or oppo search,
as some of us in the biz like to call it.

1:13:52.192 --> 1:13:54.963
Oh, well, that's good.
We'll go with that.

1:13:56.830 --> 1:13:58.299
<i>♪ Talk about ♪</i>

1:13:58.333 --> 1:14:01.835
First off, turns out
Pete Buttigieg is gay.

1:14:01.869 --> 1:14:05.139
- He's married to a man.
- Really?

1:14:05.173 --> 1:14:08.777
- Yeah. Oh, there's more.
- Very good. Very good.

1:14:08.810 --> 1:14:12.681
Well, I'm not too sure about the
reliability of me sources on this one,

1:14:12.713 --> 1:14:18.352
but Elizabeth Warren has been
pretending to be Native American.

1:14:18.386 --> 1:14:22.723
When really she's an Asian
woman. That's totally different.

1:14:22.757 --> 1:14:24.793
Totally different.

1:14:24.825 --> 1:14:27.795
- Anything else?
- Oh, yes, I have.

1:14:27.829 --> 1:14:31.799
Get ready.
Okay, so, I found a dossier,

1:14:31.833 --> 1:14:37.304
all right, in a dumpster right
behind Hillary Clinton's house.

1:14:37.338 --> 1:14:41.009
It said Donald Trump
once paid hookers,

1:14:41.042 --> 1:14:47.214
and get ready, to urinate
on a hotel room bed in Moscow.

1:14:47.248 --> 1:14:51.386
Hey? Oh, you're gonna hit him really hard
with that tidbit, now aren't you, hey?

1:14:51.419 --> 1:14:54.923
- Hey?
- I am so screwed.

1:14:58.959 --> 1:15:01.128
- Proper Manhattan.
- Oh, yeah. Thanks, love.

1:15:01.161 --> 1:15:02.931
That's nice.
I'll have that. Good on you.

1:15:08.102 --> 1:15:13.208

- Patience, Comrade. Patience.

the way either of these
two jokers turned out.

1:15:41.703 --> 1:15:44.438
How could you say that?
I was Mayor of Burlington.

1:15:44.472 --> 1:15:46.074
- Careful, kid.
- Yeah.

1:15:46.106 --> 1:15:48.176
Bernie is accessing

1:15:48.209 --> 1:15:51.980

1:15:57.819 --> 1:15:59.754
Oh, yeah,
at least I wasn't an incel, pal.

1:15:59.786 --> 1:16:03.357
Okay, let's all dial back the
hostility meter a few clicks.

1:16:03.391 --> 1:16:05.826
I wouldn't have
had that heart attack

if this guy hadn't got addicted
to Twinkies, the little shit.

1:16:09.864 --> 1:16:12.801
- Dial it back.
- Yeah, well, you wouldn't have embarrassed us all if you

1:16:12.834 --> 1:16:15.370
didn't fold like a cheap
five dollar suitcase to Hillary.

1:16:15.402 --> 1:16:17.405
- What he said, old man.
- Yeah.

1:16:17.437 --> 1:16:19.840
What I got to say about that is.

1:16:19.874 --> 1:16:23.111
Ah! Ah!

1:18:16.423 --> 1:18:21.995
Yeah, Bernie's fantasy bondage
porn story was... pretty creepy.

1:18:22.029 --> 1:18:27.334
I mean, trying to have your wife have sex
with you while the KGB listens in is...

1:18:27.368 --> 1:18:31.239
quite frankly beyond the pale...
even for me.
