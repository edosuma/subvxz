WEBVTT

01:01.333 --> 01:04.208
Who the fuck are these guys?

01:12.666 --> 01:17.541
Overwatch One. Come in, Overwatch One.
Overwatch, we got a problem.

01:17.625 --> 01:18.791
<i>Do you copy?</i>

01:18.875 --> 01:20.500
Stay off this channel.

01:20.583 --> 01:23.541
No, we have a serious problem.
Did you not hear me?

01:24.208 --> 01:27.541
<i>That's why you ever bring a lawyer</i>
<i>on an op. Stay off this channel.</i>

01:29.500 --> 01:30.500
Fuck!

02:26.416 --> 02:28.250
Mr. Nyland will see you now.

02:29.000 --> 02:30.000
Great. Thank you.

02:36.708 --> 02:38.708
-Sir.
-Are you Henderson?

02:40.208 --> 02:42.666
Uh, Hendricks, sir. Owen Hendricks.

02:43.166 --> 02:45.083
How long you been here, Mr. Hendricks?

02:45.583 --> 02:49.708
Only ten minutes, but you're very busy.
You're running the whole operation--

02:49.791 --> 02:54.250
You mean how long I've been working here.
About two days. Just finished CIA 101.

02:56.375 --> 02:58.166
I'm sending you to the Senate.

03:00.500 --> 03:01.333
Score.

03:01.916 --> 03:05.083
Word is, head of the Senate
Intelligence Committee is planning

03:05.166 --> 03:08.083
to read a classified document
at a public hearing.

03:09.583 --> 03:11.541
Okay, and you want me
to tell him he can't.

03:11.625 --> 03:14.250
Tell him that he's an engorged ball sack

03:14.333 --> 03:16.833
who should walk
into an airplane propeller.

03:18.291 --> 03:21.458
Yes, sir.
You mean tell him that figuratively.

03:23.291 --> 03:27.166
No, I don't.
Listen to me carefully, Mr. Hendricks.

03:27.250 --> 03:30.208
If you fail to stop Senator Smoot
from reading that document...

03:31.166 --> 03:34.250
you won't be working here tomorrow.
Am I clear?

03:39.583 --> 03:42.208
You're a dead man walking.

03:43.333 --> 03:47.833
Nyland thinks he can keep me in the dark
on the agency's covert clusterfucks,

03:47.916 --> 03:49.125
but he's wrong!

03:49.708 --> 03:53.458
If I wanna read a document,
I'll read a document!

03:53.541 --> 03:57.958
I have a constitutional mandate
to oversee the CIA,

03:58.041 --> 04:03.000
and I am gonna exercise the hell
out of it, starting by subpoenaing you.

04:03.750 --> 04:06.000
Now, I'm going back into my hearing...

04:08.833 --> 04:10.791
and I'm quoting this document.

04:16.541 --> 04:21.041
Sir, that is completely your prerogative
as you are head of... the committee,

04:21.666 --> 04:24.625
but may I just remind you
that revealing classified information

04:24.708 --> 04:27.666
is in violation
of 18 U.S. code section 798

04:27.750 --> 04:30.791
and will result
in not only criminal sanctions,

04:30.875 --> 04:33.791
but potential reprimand
and censure in the Senate.

04:33.875 --> 04:37.666
Also, that type of shit looks really bad
in a campaign video against you.

04:38.750 --> 04:42.208
If there's nothing else I can help with,
I gotta get back to Langley.

04:43.250 --> 04:44.750
It was a pleasure meeting you.

04:50.750 --> 04:52.208
-How did it go?
-Pretty good.

04:52.291 --> 04:54.083
-Dave!
-Thanks for your help.

04:54.166 --> 04:57.041
In my office! Now!

05:00.125 --> 05:02.541
Hey. Did you check out that new CIA swag?

05:02.625 --> 05:04.833
Yeah. I'm gonna get me
one of those ski masks.

05:04.916 --> 05:06.833
Yeah. Those are nice, right?

05:06.916 --> 05:08.458
-I don't even ski.
-Well...

05:08.541 --> 05:10.750
-I just wanna look like a bank robber.
-Oh, oh, oh.

05:11.333 --> 05:12.166
Here we go.

05:13.916 --> 05:15.375
Oh, shit-- I'm sorry.

05:15.458 --> 05:16.791
Okay. What?

05:17.791 --> 05:22.208
-Yeah. Hi. This is my office.
-We heard Nyland sent you to Capitol Hill.

05:22.291 --> 05:25.666
Yeah, I didn't get to the Senate
for six months. You get there on day two?

05:25.750 --> 05:27.875
-Trust me, it wasn't a reward.
-What was the assignment?

05:29.500 --> 05:31.625
Just advising on a classification.

05:31.708 --> 05:34.250
Don't lie to us, Hendricks.
I was a professional sneak.

05:34.333 --> 05:36.750
We know you met
with the head of Senate Intelligence.

05:36.833 --> 05:39.458
Yeah. And I got my ass handed to me.

05:39.541 --> 05:42.541
I was straight-up cannon fodder
in the Nyland-Smoot feud.

05:42.625 --> 05:44.666
Only reason
the general counsel sent me was--

05:44.750 --> 05:46.416
Because new guys
get the shit work.

05:47.625 --> 05:49.041
What the hell is this?

05:49.125 --> 05:50.333
This is the crazies.

05:50.416 --> 05:53.250
-The nutjobs.
-People trying to graymail the CIA.

05:53.333 --> 05:54.791
Every letter is from someone

05:54.875 --> 05:58.708
threatening to expose classified
information if we don't help them.

05:58.791 --> 06:01.625
-That's extortion.
-Yet we get hundreds a year.

06:01.708 --> 06:05.500
Your job? Vet each one of those.
See if the author can back up the threat.

06:08.333 --> 06:10.458
-How often does that happen?
-Hmm.

06:11.041 --> 06:11.875
It happens.

06:11.958 --> 06:15.875
Yeah. Oh, and if the secrets
they're threatening to reveal are bad,

06:16.458 --> 06:18.291
it's a nightmare to navigate.

06:34.666 --> 06:36.500
-That is a lot of coffee.
-Fuck.

06:38.416 --> 06:40.083
I can't afford to fall asleep.

06:40.166 --> 06:44.083
-Why? You got a brief?
-A brief? No. I work directly with SOG.

06:45.833 --> 06:49.208
Sorry, who are they? I'm struggling
to keep all the acronyms straight.

06:49.291 --> 06:50.916
Special Operations Group.

06:51.000 --> 06:54.625
Imagine if meth became sentient
and was given weaponry.

06:55.625 --> 06:58.250
I've been in this building
for three straight days,

06:58.958 --> 07:02.875
but if I leave, those crazy fucks
are gonna green-light a covert op

07:02.958 --> 07:05.625
that I am single-handedly
keeping them from executing.

07:05.708 --> 07:07.708
They don't listen to their lawyer?

07:09.083 --> 07:11.833
No, this place
is an organization of con men,

07:11.916 --> 07:13.875
which makes us lawyers
for cheats and liars

07:13.958 --> 07:15.916
who are actively trying to sabotage us.

07:16.416 --> 07:20.166
If you have any brains, get out before
the ink dries on your paperwork, kid.

07:20.708 --> 07:21.708
Thanks.

07:21.791 --> 07:24.250
<i>I've been unjustly imprisoned</i>
<i>in Connecticut.</i>

07:24.333 --> 07:26.541
<i>I don't know how that ham</i>
<i>ended up in my purse.</i>

07:26.625 --> 07:30.625
<i>I know about the aliens. I worked</i>
<i>for the agency in Cuba in 1963.</i>

07:30.708 --> 07:32.458
<i>It was a false flag operation.</i>

07:32.541 --> 07:36.083
<i>If you don't help me, I'll expose</i>
<i>all I know about the JFK assassination.</i>

07:36.166 --> 07:38.125
<i> My boyfriend is cheating on me.</i>

07:38.208 --> 07:42.125
<i>If you don't get him to stop, I'll expose</i>
<i>all the secret CIA prisons in Jersey.</i>

07:49.250 --> 07:51.208

<i>I'm in prison in Phoenix.</i>

07:53.625 --> 07:58.166
<i>Get me out or I will spill agency secrets</i>

07:59.208 --> 08:00.041
<i>You owe me.</i>

08:28.166 --> 08:29.125
Um...

08:43.833 --> 08:46.416
-Yo. Whoa, whoa, whoa!
-Jesus Christ! Okay.

08:46.500 --> 08:48.000
It's just Owen. You good?

08:48.500 --> 08:50.958
It's me, from the coffee... room.

08:53.083 --> 08:53.958
What do you want?

08:54.041 --> 08:56.291
Working on the crazies,
hoping you could help me.

08:56.375 --> 08:58.333
No. Absolutely not.

08:58.958 --> 09:00.166
It'll take a second.

09:00.250 --> 09:04.625
Rule number one:
Never help anyone around here.

09:04.708 --> 09:06.083
And definitely do not trust anyone.

09:06.166 --> 09:08.500
This place is designed
to pit us against each other.

09:08.583 --> 09:09.416
Okay.

09:10.375 --> 09:12.875
Got it. Except I really do need your help.

09:12.958 --> 09:16.000
So, what can I do to get you
to answer a few questions?

09:18.291 --> 09:19.833
Do you have any speed?

09:20.416 --> 09:21.250
No.

09:22.666 --> 09:25.291
-Well, this has been fun. Toodle-oo.
-My roommate takes Adderall.

09:26.166 --> 09:28.333
Good enough.
Five pills for every question. Go.

09:28.416 --> 09:33.583
Okay, so I got this letter and I came
across a very weird name, PW Butcher.

09:33.666 --> 09:35.166
Any idea what that means?

09:35.250 --> 09:36.833
Yeah, that's a cryptonym.

09:37.416 --> 09:40.041
An agency code name
for a clandestine operation.

09:40.125 --> 09:42.375
The first two letters, PW, are a digraph,

09:42.458 --> 09:45.541
literally the country code
where the operation is taking place,

09:45.625 --> 09:48.958
and the two-syllable word that follows,
Butcher, is the actual code name.

09:49.041 --> 09:50.166
Where did you find that?

09:50.250 --> 09:53.125
In the graymail letter.
Some woman in prison for murder.

09:54.166 --> 09:57.833
Yeah, there's no way an asset
should know an agency cryptonym

09:57.916 --> 09:59.375
or even know they exist.

09:59.458 --> 10:01.250
Does that mean this is the real deal?

10:02.750 --> 10:05.083
-Pfft. Not my department. Mm-mm.
-Come on.

10:06.916 --> 10:08.708
I'll give you ten extra pills.

10:12.416 --> 10:14.208
Do I follow up on this or not?

10:16.666 --> 10:17.500
I wouldn't.

10:18.625 --> 10:20.708
Why does it feel like that's a yes?

10:21.291 --> 10:25.500
Okay, if you were not gonna follow up
on this, where would you not go?

10:30.291 --> 10:32.291
I gotta talk to someone about an old op.

10:34.958 --> 10:38.166
Excuse me, ladies, could you--?
What's up, dude? Could you, uh--?

10:43.166 --> 10:45.791
My name's Owen Hendricks
from the general counsel's office.

10:46.375 --> 10:47.583
Not interested.

10:47.666 --> 10:50.500
I can respect that,
but I got questions that need answering.

10:52.375 --> 10:53.458
Make it fast.

10:53.541 --> 10:54.416
Sure.

10:57.416 --> 11:00.416
What can you tell me
about the cryptonym PW Butcher?

11:00.500 --> 11:03.458
PW is the country code for Belarus,
and then Butcher...

11:04.125 --> 11:06.958
is a code name
for an operation in Belarus in 2009.

11:07.041 --> 11:10.041
Okay. Great.
And what about the name Selby Shaw?

11:10.750 --> 11:13.750
-What about it?
-Is it connected to PW Butcher?

11:17.333 --> 11:19.541
I don't have access to the specifics,

11:19.625 --> 11:21.916
but Selby Shaw
is a pseudonym for a DO officer

11:22.000 --> 11:23.750
who operated in Belarus at that time.

11:23.833 --> 11:26.541
Hmm. Okay. They're both tracking as--

11:27.958 --> 11:30.541
Would you mind putting in the name
Max Meladze? Maxine Meladze.

11:30.625 --> 11:32.666
M-E-L-A-D-Z-E. See what comes up.

11:37.666 --> 11:38.500
Please.

11:42.750 --> 11:43.583
Nothing.

11:44.250 --> 11:45.625
-You sure?
-Yeah.

11:47.083 --> 11:48.708
What's this about, anyways?

11:51.875 --> 11:54.375
Agency got a graymail letter from Meladze.

11:54.458 --> 11:55.666
Jesus Christ.

11:56.250 --> 11:59.041
-What?
-There's no way anyone outside the agency

11:59.125 --> 12:02.208
should know a classified agency cryptonym
and an officer pseudonym.

12:02.875 --> 12:07.666
-Could Meladze could be one of ours?
-Not without her showing up in the system.

12:08.500 --> 12:09.500
But?

12:11.083 --> 12:13.083
But it's possible
she was a hip-pocket asset,

12:13.166 --> 12:16.333
so there wouldn't be a file on her
and no way to ID her case officer.

12:16.416 --> 12:19.125
Why would her handler soft file her
in the first place?

12:19.833 --> 12:22.291
She could've been a new source
he hadn't fully vetted.

12:22.375 --> 12:24.500
With that level
of institutional knowledge?

12:25.083 --> 12:25.916
No.

12:26.583 --> 12:27.750
That's troubling.

12:28.708 --> 12:29.541
Okay.

12:30.583 --> 12:34.000
Listen to me. I need you
to give me Selby Shaw's real name.

12:38.291 --> 12:41.000
-And you think this is real?
-Yes.

12:41.083 --> 12:43.333
Sir, she knows classified information.

12:43.416 --> 12:45.791
-And you ran all this down in a few hours.
-Yes, sir.

12:45.875 --> 12:48.791
And I have a lead on where to go next.
Our operative's real name.

12:50.041 --> 12:52.916
Selby Shaw
is a pseudonym for Dawn Gilbane.

12:53.958 --> 12:55.875
What the hell is wrong with you?

12:58.041 --> 13:01.333
Never write an officer's true name
and their pseudonym on the same paper.

13:03.583 --> 13:06.916
-Uh, sorry, sir, I didn't know.
-Get Kitchens and Ebner in here.

13:13.375 --> 13:14.583
This can't be good.

13:18.291 --> 13:21.291
-Where is she now?
-Meladze? At a prison in Phoenix.

13:21.375 --> 13:22.791
-No, the operative.
-Gilbane.

13:22.875 --> 13:24.833
She's at an agency black site in Yemen.

13:27.083 --> 13:27.916
Yes, sir?

13:28.000 --> 13:29.916
Who had the crazies
before Hendricks?

13:31.291 --> 13:33.541
-I did.
-Did you even open the folder?

13:33.625 --> 13:36.666
Of course, sir. I did my due diligence
with everything in there--

13:37.833 --> 13:39.583
Keep going with the investigation.

13:39.666 --> 13:42.000
These two will pick up the slack
on your workload.

13:42.083 --> 13:42.916
Yes, sir.

13:47.666 --> 13:49.583
-Yes, sir?

13:57.291 --> 13:58.416
Oh, sh--

14:11.166 --> 14:14.708
-Thanks for screwing me over.
-I'm sorry, man. I had no idea.

14:14.791 --> 14:16.583
Yeah, bullshit. You set me up.

14:17.125 --> 14:20.791
You set yourself up by doing jack shit
with those folders when you had them.

14:20.875 --> 14:23.791
That's not true.
Violet had the folders before me.

14:23.875 --> 14:27.791
-How many cases of graymail did you find?
-A few. So, what's the story?

14:27.875 --> 14:30.916
A possible hip-pocket asset
that knows too much.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.000
How do I get to Yemen?

14:32.083 --> 14:33.666
Nyland didn't say, "Go to Yemen."

14:33.750 --> 14:36.000
He said:
"Keep going with the investigation."

14:36.083 --> 14:39.375
Yes, but the answers I need are in Yemen.
So how do I get there?

14:41.875 --> 14:43.916
Travel coach. Rent an economy car.

14:44.000 --> 14:44.958
Seriously?

14:47.083 --> 14:49.833
Yeah.
And keep the receipts for everything.

14:50.541 --> 14:52.916
They don't call this place
"the Company" for nothing.

14:55.041 --> 14:59.208
I don't think
I've ever seen you dance like that before.

14:59.291 --> 15:01.375
This is amazing.

15:02.708 --> 15:04.375
-All right. What's up?
-Okay.

15:05.000 --> 15:09.083
If I get this in,
you have to buy groceries for the week.

15:10.750 --> 15:13.375
-Oh, wow, that was so close.
-Ooh.

15:14.291 --> 15:19.041
Okay, you have gotta clean the bathroom.
No. You gotta clean Owen and I's shower.

15:19.125 --> 15:20.916
That sounds disgusting.

15:21.916 --> 15:23.708
Whoo! Thank you.

15:25.000 --> 15:26.416
-Hey.
-Hi.

15:27.041 --> 15:28.916
Did you bring beer? I texted you.

15:29.000 --> 15:30.583
Uh, no. You didn't.

15:31.333 --> 15:33.458
-Huh.
-Hey.

15:34.541 --> 15:36.833
-What's up, Bubba?
-I texted my mom.

15:36.916 --> 15:38.833
No, you slow down, Mother.

15:38.916 --> 15:43.458
-Ooh. Sucks. Is there any food?
-Uh, there might be some pizza left.

15:45.958 --> 15:47.666
What are you wearing?

15:48.541 --> 15:51.625
It's Tad's. We're role playing later.

15:51.708 --> 15:54.083
I am making a special delivery.

15:54.166 --> 15:55.708
I'm so sorry that I asked.

15:58.625 --> 16:00.416
-I'll take that.
-Where you going?

16:00.500 --> 16:02.625
-Ah. You got next.
-I gotta pack.

16:02.708 --> 16:03.833
To go where?

16:04.541 --> 16:05.500
It's classified.

16:07.458 --> 16:09.416
Look how smug he is about that.

16:09.500 --> 16:11.166
So smug. Why so smug?

16:14.166 --> 16:16.541
Are you ready, Chicago?

16:24.541 --> 16:28.125
So, seriously, where are you going?

16:28.208 --> 16:29.875
Seriously, I can't tell you.

16:31.250 --> 16:33.083
Okay. Well, how's your new job?

16:33.625 --> 16:37.416
Have you made any new friends
or overthrown any foreign governments?

16:37.500 --> 16:40.208
No to the friends.
Maybe to the governments.

16:40.291 --> 16:41.250
Fingers crossed.

16:43.875 --> 16:46.250
-Your mom called me.
-Oh?

16:46.333 --> 16:49.166
Apparently, you forgot to tell her
that we aren't dating anymore.

16:49.250 --> 16:52.166
Well, I haven't talked to her
in six months,

16:52.250 --> 16:55.000
so she also doesn't know
I work at the CIA.

16:56.750 --> 16:59.166
You can't avoid dealing with her forever.

16:59.708 --> 17:00.791
Sure I can.

17:00.875 --> 17:02.625
-Hey, how's the firm?
-Ugh.

17:03.125 --> 17:06.125
All I do
is freeze my ass off in a conference room,

17:06.208 --> 17:09.541
reading technical specs
on homicidal dialysis machines.

17:09.625 --> 17:12.166
The joy of being a first year
at a law firm.

17:12.250 --> 17:14.750
You should've joined the agency with me.

17:14.833 --> 17:18.083
Oh, my God. Could you imagine?
My parents would kill me.

17:19.708 --> 17:20.666
There's this cool thing.

17:20.750 --> 17:24.000
It's called "not giving a fuck what
your parents think." Super liberating.

17:24.083 --> 17:27.916
-Did you find out where he's going?
-My powers of seduction were ineffective.

17:28.416 --> 17:30.125
Do you mind if I take this?

17:30.208 --> 17:31.375
-No.
-Thank you.

17:31.458 --> 17:34.750
Well, he's definitely flying
because he's packing a carry-on,

17:34.833 --> 17:38.875
but he is not flying for long
because he's only packing a carry-on.

17:38.958 --> 17:42.791
Your powers of deduction
are wasted at the Department of Treasury.

17:42.875 --> 17:45.875
Okay, just for that, Tad and I,
we're gonna role play in your room tonight

17:45.958 --> 17:48.916
once you're off circumnavigating the globe
in your government jet.

17:49.416 --> 17:52.666
-I don't get a jet.
-Since when do spies fly commercial?

17:53.208 --> 17:54.250
I'm not a spy.

17:54.333 --> 17:55.166
I am a lawyer.

18:51.750 --> 18:53.375
Hey!

18:53.458 --> 18:55.833
What's going on, man? How's it going?

18:56.541 --> 18:59.791
I'm Owen Hendricks
over at the general counsel's office.

19:00.583 --> 19:04.500
Oh, shit. Oh, fuck.
Okay, listen, man. No, no, no. Wait. Whoa!

19:04.583 --> 19:05.916
God.

19:11.375 --> 19:14.041
Hey, hi.
I think there's been a mistake. Fuck.

19:16.916 --> 19:19.583
Wow. You guys really loosened these teeth.

19:20.750 --> 19:24.750
I'm an American, dumbass.
So, there's been--

19:30.208 --> 19:34.375
Thank God. Hi. I'm Owen Hendricks
from the general counsel's office.

19:34.458 --> 19:38.291
And you just thought
you'd pop by a black site unannounced.

19:38.375 --> 19:40.208
Sorry. Was I supposed to call?

19:45.083 --> 19:47.583
There was no cable traffic
about your trip.

19:48.166 --> 19:51.541
No clearance
from the ambassador or diplomatic cover.

19:51.625 --> 19:53.583
-Well, I'm new.
-You're an idiot.

19:54.500 --> 19:57.875
-Or just pretending to be one.
-It's actually neither of those.

19:57.958 --> 20:00.333
-Hmm.
-I flew all the way here

20:00.416 --> 20:01.833
to talk to you about an old op

20:01.916 --> 20:04.916
-from many years ago. What--?
-Bullshit. Bullshit.

20:08.166 --> 20:09.791
-What color is this?

20:13.416 --> 20:14.250
Blue?

20:15.916 --> 20:21.041
You really are new. Otherwise, the agency
would have issued you a black passport

20:21.541 --> 20:24.041
which grants you diplomatic immunity.

20:25.791 --> 20:26.708
No one told me that.

20:27.291 --> 20:28.333
-Strip him.
-What?

20:29.125 --> 20:32.625
What? Wait a second.
What are you doing? No, no. Whoa, guys.

20:35.916 --> 20:39.083
Fuck. No.
Hey, this is a new suit. What is going on?

20:39.166 --> 20:43.625
That's what I wanna know. No way
you came out here to talk about an old op.

20:43.708 --> 20:46.791
I think you're here to investigate us,
which makes you a hostile.

20:46.875 --> 20:48.125
But you fucked up.

20:48.208 --> 20:50.666
Without a cover identity
and a diplomatic passport,

20:50.750 --> 20:54.333
the Yemeni secret police will arrest you
for spying and shoot you in the head.

20:54.416 --> 20:57.166
With a black passport,
you just get deported.

20:57.791 --> 21:00.750
But someone should have told you that
before you got on the plane.

21:02.208 --> 21:05.166
-Made some enemies at work already?
-Looks like it.

21:05.250 --> 21:08.958
-You sure don't have any friends here.
-All right. Let's-- Wait.

21:09.458 --> 21:12.458
So... here's what's gonna happen.

21:13.916 --> 21:16.458
You're gonna tell me
what you're really doing in my black site

21:16.541 --> 21:20.250
or the PSO is gonna get
an anonymous tip you're up to no good.

21:20.333 --> 21:23.958
You're gonna end up with a cattle prod
in one end, a hollow point in the other.

21:24.583 --> 21:25.625
No, no, no.

21:25.708 --> 21:27.541
Fuck!

21:28.291 --> 21:31.833
God! I'm telling you the truth!
I came across a graymail

21:31.916 --> 21:36.708
that was connected to a fucking operation
that you ran. Wait, wait, listen to me.

21:36.791 --> 21:39.625
It's my first week on the job.
I got recruited in law school.

21:39.708 --> 21:41.541
I said no to a bunch of high-paying jobs

21:41.625 --> 21:44.000
because I got this pathological need
for stimulation.

21:44.083 --> 21:46.375
Probably 'cause my dad
got blown up in Afghanistan.

21:46.458 --> 21:47.458
My mom never got over it.

21:47.541 --> 21:50.166
I have just been running away

21:50.250 --> 21:53.833
from having to spend any longer than five
minutes with my thoughts alone ever since.

21:53.916 --> 21:55.500
So, yeah, when that recruit came

21:55.583 --> 21:58.416
and he promised me I could do cool stuff,
I thought, "Fuck it."

21:58.500 --> 22:02.125
And, you know, fuck it.
Maybe I'll even make my dad proud.

22:02.208 --> 22:06.375
You know, I have been faking it
until I made it for my entire life,

22:06.458 --> 22:08.916
but I'm sorry
because I can fucking understand

22:09.000 --> 22:13.083
how I have clearly miscalculated
applying that approach to the agency.

22:19.250 --> 22:20.083
What's the op?

22:22.166 --> 22:24.958
PW Butcher.
The asset's name is Maxine Meladze.

22:25.041 --> 22:26.458
She wrote us a graymail letter.

22:29.458 --> 22:30.500
Cut him loose.

22:38.500 --> 22:40.291
Yeah, I fucking pissed myself.

22:40.833 --> 22:43.333
Congratulations.
You are good at your jobs.

22:44.458 --> 22:46.041
<i>I never met Meladze.</i>

22:46.125 --> 22:47.375
But you remember her.

22:48.041 --> 22:48.875
Vaguely.

22:49.458 --> 22:51.958
I used HUMINT from her to carry out an op.

22:52.541 --> 22:55.333
If I remember right,
she was a pretty valuable asset.

22:55.416 --> 22:58.708
Upper-level player of the Belarus chapter
of the Russian mafia.

22:58.791 --> 23:02.041
She had serious connections
inside Russian intelligence.

23:02.625 --> 23:05.541
-Who was her handler?
-Sorry, I don't remember.

23:06.333 --> 23:09.291
It was a long time ago,
and I've run a hundred ops since then.

23:09.375 --> 23:10.958
But she was a big deal.

23:11.750 --> 23:14.708
And the fact that somebody
would hip-pocket a girl like that

23:14.791 --> 23:16.333
should scare the crap out of you.

23:16.416 --> 23:20.083
Listen,
sorry about the enhanced interrogation.

23:20.583 --> 23:22.791
-Yeah.
-Some guys might hold a grudge.

23:22.875 --> 23:27.125
I chalk it up to a communication breakdown
and a lesson on the importance

23:27.208 --> 23:30.041
of following protocol when interacting
with clandestine services.

23:30.125 --> 23:33.708
So I don't have to tell anyone
at Langley about the whole torture thing?

23:33.791 --> 23:37.208
Exactly. Although some people
might enjoy hearing about it.

23:37.750 --> 23:42.000
Yeah. Pretty sure
I can smooth things out with them, though.

23:42.916 --> 23:46.416
Working at the CIA is like
a never ending game of musical chairs.

23:46.500 --> 23:51.000
Everyone is maneuvering to figure out
who will have a seat when the music stops.

23:51.083 --> 23:55.583
Easiest way to make sure you have a seat
is to hamstring the guy next to you.

23:56.583 --> 23:59.583
If you don't start playing,
figuring out how shit works,

24:00.083 --> 24:01.708
you're gonna be in trouble.

24:02.500 --> 24:04.500
More trouble than getting
my fingernail pulled out?

24:04.583 --> 24:07.750
Nails grow back. Drive safe.

24:08.791 --> 24:10.625
Keep an eye peeled for the PSO.

24:40.541 --> 24:41.375
How did it go?

24:57.916 --> 24:59.583
Oh, I can't talk about it.

25:00.291 --> 25:02.375
-What?
-I can't talk about it.

25:02.458 --> 25:06.083
-Come on, man. Just let me sleep.
-What are you wearing?

25:08.333 --> 25:09.791
My suit got ruined.

25:09.875 --> 25:10.833
Mm-hm.

25:12.625 --> 25:15.000
I'm surprised they let you
on the plane wearing that.

25:16.750 --> 25:19.291
Suggests a country
with lesser security standards.

25:19.375 --> 25:22.833
-Third world, perhaps?
-I said I can't talk about it.

25:26.291 --> 25:28.125
-What's going on?
-Oh, my God.

25:28.208 --> 25:31.708
-Owen was in the shit somewhere.
-Owen loves being in the shit.

25:31.791 --> 25:34.916
-He didn't love this.
-Can you guys please just let me sleep?

25:35.625 --> 25:36.458
What happened?

25:37.791 --> 25:39.125
I can't talk about it.

25:40.125 --> 25:40.958
But I'm fine.

25:42.500 --> 25:43.708
You don't seem fine.

25:49.458 --> 25:50.291
Come on.

25:50.791 --> 25:52.708
What--? What are you doing?

25:54.208 --> 25:55.916
Mm. Being human.

25:58.250 --> 26:00.000
Come on. Get in here.

26:00.708 --> 26:04.250
-I don't wanna wrinkle my outfit.
-Said by no one young ever.

26:09.083 --> 26:10.083
I'm running late.

26:11.083 --> 26:13.166
Call me if you wanna talk. Okay?

26:13.250 --> 26:14.166
Thank you.

26:17.000 --> 26:17.833
Are you okay?

26:19.833 --> 26:20.666
I am now.

26:22.000 --> 26:23.416
Now, get out of my room.

26:24.375 --> 26:26.333
Okay. Get some sleep.

26:33.083 --> 26:35.041
-No.

26:44.333 --> 26:46.625
-Hello.
-<i>Hold for the general counsel.</i>

26:48.166 --> 26:49.541
<i>Where the fuck are you?</i>

26:59.708 --> 27:01.083
-Hi.
-How was Yemen?

27:03.500 --> 27:05.583
It was great. No thanks to you two.

27:06.500 --> 27:10.375
Look, I don't mind getting hazed
'cause I'm the new guy,

27:10.458 --> 27:13.375
but if either one of you try to
torpedo me like that again,

27:14.125 --> 27:15.500
we're gonna have a problem.

27:17.291 --> 27:18.291
Hmm.

27:18.375 --> 27:22.041
Now, I gotta get upstairs.
General counsel needs me. Again.

27:24.166 --> 27:25.000
Cheers.

27:26.416 --> 27:29.958
Without a 201 file, no way to know
who Meladze's handler was.

27:30.458 --> 27:34.000
But given that Agent Gilbane
confirmed that Max was an asset,

27:34.083 --> 27:36.750
we have to take
the graymail threat seriously.

27:37.625 --> 27:40.541
-I didn't tell you to go to Yemen.
-Yes, sir.

27:41.958 --> 27:45.000
I decided to make the judgment call
that it was the necessary next step.

27:45.541 --> 27:49.208
Plus, I figured you're the type of leader
who appreciates initiative,

27:49.291 --> 27:51.416
but if you want me to get approval--

27:51.500 --> 27:53.041
No. Initiative is good.

27:54.916 --> 27:55.750
Nice job.

27:57.166 --> 27:58.000
Thank you.

28:00.291 --> 28:01.916
What happened to your hand?

28:07.041 --> 28:08.458
Closed it in a car door.

28:09.291 --> 28:10.291
Ah.

28:13.541 --> 28:15.416
Go to Phoenix. Talk to Meladze.

28:16.375 --> 28:17.208
Yes, sir.

28:23.625 --> 28:24.458
Now?

28:26.083 --> 28:28.750
Sir, it's just,
my day started three days ago.

28:31.333 --> 28:32.958
Great. Yeah. Phoenix it is.

28:39.666 --> 28:41.541
<i>What can you tell me about Max Meladze?</i>

28:42.250 --> 28:45.250
She's been held without bail
due to the brutal nature of her crime.

28:45.333 --> 28:48.708
-Who'd she kill?
-A trucking guy named Salvatore Kwitny.

28:49.291 --> 28:53.208
Phoenix PD thinks Miss Meladze
was using his trucks to run product.

28:55.541 --> 28:57.791
So, what is the CIA's interest in her?

28:57.875 --> 29:01.791
Not at liberty to say,
but I'll need a digital copy of her file

29:01.875 --> 29:04.666
and a private room to meet with her.
No listeners, no cameras.

29:45.833 --> 29:46.666
Shall we?

29:51.625 --> 29:52.875
Who are you?

29:52.958 --> 29:55.833
I'm Owen Hendricks from the
general counsel's office at the CIA.

29:56.625 --> 29:57.750
We got your letter.

29:59.791 --> 30:02.208
-Took you long enough.
-Yeah, it's a busy place.

30:02.291 --> 30:06.083
You know that making threats
against the agency's a crime, right?

30:06.666 --> 30:07.791
I know many things.

30:08.875 --> 30:11.083
More than you, that's for sure.

30:14.208 --> 30:16.708
So how long has it been, huh? A few weeks?

30:17.208 --> 30:21.208
-You know how to use the copy machine?
-We're not here to talk about me.

30:21.291 --> 30:25.166
-What happened to your hand?
-I closed it in a car door.

30:26.625 --> 30:32.125
Liar. I've pulled out enough fingernails
to know what it looks like afterwards.

30:34.625 --> 30:36.000
You seem really proud of that.

30:36.083 --> 30:38.541
Shouldn't I be?
Some of those nails were for the CIA.

30:38.625 --> 30:41.500
Oh, is that one of the things
that you're threatening to expose?

30:41.583 --> 30:42.416
No.

30:43.458 --> 30:47.750
-So how do you like the agency so far?
-It's great. Who was your handler?

30:48.250 --> 30:51.083
Dumb question, because now I know
you have no hard file on me.

30:51.583 --> 30:55.083
Which means you have no idea
what I know or who I can burn.

30:56.666 --> 30:59.833
Maybe. But I'm gonna find out soon enough.

30:59.916 --> 31:02.041
Only if I tell you, which I won't...

31:03.041 --> 31:05.000
unless you do some things for me.

31:06.166 --> 31:08.541
-Who pulled out your fingernail?
-No one.

31:08.625 --> 31:10.750
I have classified CIA documents.

31:12.125 --> 31:13.375
You have documents?

31:13.875 --> 31:16.666
So many documents.
Who pulled out your nail?

31:19.500 --> 31:22.750
An operative in Yemen.
I went to ask her about you.

31:22.833 --> 31:27.000
"Her." You know, you give away information
without realizing it.

31:28.041 --> 31:30.541
I'm surprised you survived your trip.

31:32.375 --> 31:34.208
It certainly doesn't inspire confidence

31:34.291 --> 31:36.791
that you're the right lawyer
to help me get out of here.

31:36.875 --> 31:39.500
-I am not here to get you out.
-Games.

31:40.083 --> 31:41.708
I am bored.

31:41.791 --> 31:45.291
-Tell your boss to call someone else.
-Wait, hold on. Just--

31:47.458 --> 31:51.125
Hi, excuse me, one second, excuse me.
Excuse me. Miss, please.

31:56.625 --> 31:57.875
Give me those documents.

31:57.958 --> 32:00.791
If you're telling me the truth,
then I'll help you.

32:01.791 --> 32:02.916
There. See?

32:03.500 --> 32:04.791
Was that so hard?

32:05.833 --> 32:08.833
-They're in a storage locker.
-You have top-secret CIA documents

32:08.916 --> 32:11.083
in a storage locker
where anyone can find them?

32:11.166 --> 32:12.791
I like to live dangerously.

32:13.291 --> 32:15.083
<i>you need to secure</i>
<i>those files ASAP.</i>

32:15.166 --> 32:18.000
<i>Call the local FBI office</i>
<i>and get an escort.</i>

32:18.083 --> 32:18.916
Yes, sir.

32:19.500 --> 32:22.500
-You need me to send Kitchens to help?
<i>-No, sir. Definitely not.</i>

32:23.583 --> 32:26.291
-I've got this.
-<i>All right. Don't fuck this up.</i>

32:33.125 --> 32:35.000
<i>You have reached</i>
<i>the Phoenix Division</i>

32:35.083 --> 32:36.583
<i>of the Federal Bureau of Investigation.</i>

32:36.666 --> 32:39.666
<i>If you know your party's extension,</i>
<i>you can dial it at any time.</i>

32:39.750 --> 32:41.541
<i>For Cyber Division, press one.</i>

32:41.625 --> 32:44.083
<i>For International Operations Division,</i>
<i>press two.</i>

32:44.166 --> 32:47.083
<i>For Critical Incident Response Group,</i>
<i>press three.</i>

32:47.166 --> 32:50.041
<i>For Criminal Investigative Division,</i>
<i>press four.</i>

32:50.125 --> 32:52.833
<i>You have pressed four,</i>
<i>Criminal Investigative Division.</i>

32:52.916 --> 32:54.458
<i>All investigators are--</i>

32:54.541 --> 32:55.458
Fuck it, man.

33:16.666 --> 33:19.291
<i>Empathy can be thought of in several ways.</i>

33:20.291 --> 33:23.333
<i>The first is to contrast empathy</i>
<i>with sympathy...</i>

33:37.875 --> 33:38.875
<i>In true psychopaths...</i>

33:38.958 --> 33:40.458
Who the fuck is this guy?

33:40.541 --> 33:43.500
<i>...the parts of the brain</i>
<i>that control empathy are dark.</i>

33:52.250 --> 33:54.375
<i>Psychopaths have reduced connections</i>

33:54.458 --> 33:56.625
<i>between the ventral medial</i>
<i>prefrontal cortex,</i>

33:57.291 --> 33:59.125
<i>the part of the brain responsible for...</i>

34:15.250 --> 34:16.375
We'll take the bag.

34:23.125 --> 34:26.958
Bro, what's your plan here?
It's not like you'll get out of there.

34:28.291 --> 34:29.666
I'm sorry. Who are you?

34:29.750 --> 34:32.916
We're the guys who are gonna take the bag.
Did you not see his gun?

34:33.000 --> 34:34.083
No, I saw it, man.

34:34.166 --> 34:37.125
Just not the first one I've seen today--
Yesterday.

34:37.208 --> 34:39.916
It was two days ago.
I can't do the math, man.

34:40.000 --> 34:43.291
-It's been an epically strange day.
-No problem. We can end it for you.

34:43.375 --> 34:46.041
No, I'm good. Wasn't really complaining.

34:46.125 --> 34:49.625
Open the gate. Give us the bag,
maybe we'll let you go home.

34:49.708 --> 34:51.541
Not gonna happen, man. My bad.

34:52.666 --> 34:55.250
You do know
bullets go through metal, right?

34:58.166 --> 35:00.333
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

35:02.333 --> 35:04.041
Hey, relax! Relax! <i>Calmate!</i>

35:04.125 --> 35:06.625
I got it! It's fine! Come in. I got it.

35:06.708 --> 35:08.541
-All right.

35:16.333 --> 35:17.375
Shit.

36:23.500 --> 36:25.083
That was not cool, bro.

36:26.500 --> 36:28.666
You made me run. I hate running.

36:30.375 --> 36:31.208
The bag.

36:33.208 --> 36:34.041
Fuck you.

37:54.125 --> 37:55.250
You look rough.

37:57.208 --> 37:59.125
You got a little bit of vomit...

38:06.875 --> 38:09.583
Using me as an errand boy
almost got me killed.

38:10.083 --> 38:12.208
Who the fuck booby-traps a bag with acid?

38:13.375 --> 38:14.208
A survivor.

38:16.291 --> 38:17.125
Where's my money?

38:17.208 --> 38:20.458
In my trunk. Who were the guys
trying to get it from me?

38:20.541 --> 38:23.750
Disgruntled competitors.
They think it belongs to them.

38:24.250 --> 38:26.666
As soon as we're done,
I'm giving it to the police.

38:26.750 --> 38:28.375
Are you really this stupid?

38:29.375 --> 38:31.208
No, you're not handing it over.

38:31.291 --> 38:33.416
When you leave here, take the bag,

38:33.500 --> 38:36.041
put it in a garbage can
at the back of the parking lot,

38:36.125 --> 38:38.458
and I will have someone
pick it up and secure it for me.

38:38.541 --> 38:39.583
Why would I do that?

38:39.666 --> 38:42.625
Because I have all the leverage.
You have no idea who I am,

38:42.708 --> 38:46.750
or what I know, Owen,
and that should scare the shit out of you.

38:47.375 --> 38:50.708
So I spent the afternoon
going through your social media.

38:51.208 --> 38:53.708
Thank you for giving me
your real name by the way.

38:53.791 --> 38:55.250
Who I am is hardly relevant.

38:55.333 --> 38:59.250
I disagree because now I know
everything you've done since college.

38:59.791 --> 39:02.166
Every place you've lived.
Every woman you've dated.

39:02.958 --> 39:07.375
I know that your father
is buried in a military cemetery and...

39:08.208 --> 39:10.208
you spend a lot of time there.

39:10.291 --> 39:12.333
I don't need social media
to know who you are, Max.

39:13.208 --> 39:16.583
I read your arrest report.
I saw the photos of your house.

39:17.416 --> 39:22.458
You're a woman that lives without life.
Not even one photo on any of your walls.

39:22.541 --> 39:24.291
What, no family? No friends?

39:25.250 --> 39:26.166
No joy?

39:27.666 --> 39:31.166
Seems like the only thing that you have
is being a criminal.

39:32.625 --> 39:34.708
How I live my life isn't important.

39:35.333 --> 39:40.083
I know about dozens of top secret
CIA operations in Belarus and Russia

39:40.166 --> 39:42.375
involving incredibly
well-connected people.

39:42.458 --> 39:45.458
Stuff the agency
would do anything to keep secret.

39:45.541 --> 39:47.541
So here's what you're going to do.

39:47.625 --> 39:51.041
You're gonna go back to Langley and make
sure the Company's number one priority

39:51.125 --> 39:53.000
is having the murder charges
against me dropped.

39:53.583 --> 39:57.083
And if anyone there thinks
it would be easier to have me killed,

39:57.166 --> 40:01.166
if anything happens to me,
a press release will go out

40:01.250 --> 40:04.958
detailing the minutiae of a decade's worth
of clandestine operations.

40:05.041 --> 40:07.416
-And guess who will be blamed?
-I get it.

40:09.708 --> 40:11.166
Let me call my boss.

40:11.250 --> 40:12.083
Oh, my God.

40:12.625 --> 40:13.833
No. Owen.

40:15.041 --> 40:16.791
You're not calling your boss.

40:16.875 --> 40:19.375
He isn't going to want
anything to do with this.

40:19.458 --> 40:21.000
When he finds out how bad this is,

40:21.083 --> 40:24.000
he will do anything
to wrap this around your neck.

40:24.791 --> 40:28.875
There's no reason why you need
to be collateral damage in all of this.

40:29.625 --> 40:31.708
Do not try to manipulate me. Don't.

40:33.375 --> 40:35.250
I'm just a lawyer doing my job.

40:35.333 --> 40:38.166
No. You're just a lawyer
standing in the middle of a minefield,

40:38.250 --> 40:39.500
and you don't even know it.

40:39.583 --> 40:41.625
So, yeah. Do what you need to do.

40:41.708 --> 40:43.916
Stumble around, blow yourself up,

40:44.000 --> 40:48.125
or you can let me guide you through this
so you don't destroy yourself.

40:49.750 --> 40:51.958
Your compassion is touching,

40:52.041 --> 40:55.291
but there's no way you're offering to
help me out of the goodness of your heart.

40:58.791 --> 41:01.291
So, you don't have
the leverage that you claim.

41:01.375 --> 41:02.541
-Oh, no?
-No.

41:03.791 --> 41:07.125
If I'm in a minefield,
and I'm not buying your premise...

41:08.583 --> 41:12.000
you need me to get out safe
or else you might not survive.

41:13.208 --> 41:16.625
You really thought it was
Christmas morning when I walked in here.

41:17.333 --> 41:20.250
A kid fresh out of law school who
doesn't even know how to run the copier.

41:20.333 --> 41:21.541
I think that's what you said.

41:22.041 --> 41:24.833
You thought you could manipulate
and bully me into doing things your way,

41:24.916 --> 41:28.583
but you made a mistake, I'm a guy
that doesn't mind falling on his face

41:28.666 --> 41:29.916
or getting in over my head.

41:30.000 --> 41:31.583
I actually kinda like that.

41:32.916 --> 41:34.416
It's why I get up in the morning.

41:36.250 --> 41:37.791
So stop playing games.

41:40.125 --> 41:41.875
I need you and you need me.

41:43.166 --> 41:44.416
So let's make a deal.

41:48.083 --> 41:51.958
Forget it. You're a murderer.
The last thing I need is your help.

41:52.041 --> 41:54.583
I'm going back to Langley,
giving a full report on what happened.

41:54.666 --> 41:55.750
I'll be in touch.

41:55.833 --> 41:57.083
-Okay.
-Guard.

41:57.166 --> 42:00.500
You do that, but before you leave,
I have a parting gift for you.

42:03.291 --> 42:05.041
My handler was Not Bob.

42:07.791 --> 42:11.416
-What is that, a fucking riddle?
-No, your agency will know who it is.

42:12.458 --> 42:14.375
-Good luck.

42:15.791 --> 42:17.125
You're gonna need it.

42:49.125 --> 42:52.458
<i>So I spent the afternoon</i>
<i>going through your social media.</i>

42:57.458 --> 43:00.291
<i>Now I know</i>
<i>everything you've done since college.</i>

43:10.208 --> 43:11.541
<i>Every place you've lived.</i>

43:20.916 --> 43:22.416
<i>Every woman you've dated.</i>

43:41.791 --> 43:43.333
Sor--- Just one second.

43:56.791 --> 43:58.541
Oh, no. No.

43:59.583 --> 44:01.791
No, no, no. What-- What time is it?

44:02.541 --> 44:06.000
-What day is it?
-It's 9 a.m. on Thursday.

44:07.791 --> 44:08.666
Oh, fuck.

44:09.875 --> 44:10.958
Fuck. Uh...

44:12.583 --> 44:15.125
Last thing I remember, I-- I was eating...

44:19.291 --> 44:20.125
Yep.

44:20.833 --> 44:23.708
Those barbarians. They drugged me
so they could go run their op.

44:24.583 --> 44:25.958
Uh, can't you stop them?

44:26.041 --> 44:28.666
No, once they're wheels up,
all I can do is damage control.

44:30.666 --> 44:33.208
Well, so long as you're not busy, um,

44:33.833 --> 44:36.666
if I said the name "Not Bob,"
what would you say?

44:37.625 --> 44:38.458
What?

44:39.500 --> 44:43.083
Hey, I ate an Ambien sandwich.
I need short simple questions.

44:43.166 --> 44:44.416
Who is Not Bob?

44:45.041 --> 44:47.458
-Everybody's heard of Not Bob.
-I haven't.

44:48.000 --> 44:50.083
He's a legend inside the agency,

44:50.166 --> 44:53.083
ran the most dangerous ops in history,
he retired as a division chief.

44:53.166 --> 44:54.791
Why do we call him Not Bob?

44:55.291 --> 44:59.750
Because he refused to use the pseudonym
of Bob or Robert as a first name.

44:59.833 --> 45:02.916
Well, I just got Not Bob's name
from my graymailer.

45:07.583 --> 45:09.291
-You're lying.
-I'm not.

45:09.375 --> 45:12.291
Assets don't know
their case officers' real names,

45:12.375 --> 45:14.416
and sure as shit wouldn't know
an internal nickname.

45:14.500 --> 45:18.250
People keep saying that she shouldn't know
these things, and then she does.

45:18.333 --> 45:21.500
-So, what am I supposed to do?
-Get out of my office.

45:21.583 --> 45:22.416
Janus.

45:22.500 --> 45:25.333
I have enough trouble
trying to control my rogue spec ops team.

45:25.416 --> 45:28.541
The last thing I need is any of your
radioactive graymail case getting on me.

45:28.625 --> 45:30.791
Come on. It can't be that bad.

45:30.875 --> 45:33.458
It's always that bad, you moron.

45:34.583 --> 45:37.833
Not Bob isn't just some
former king shit CIA officer.

45:37.916 --> 45:40.041
He is currently the chief of staff--

45:41.166 --> 45:42.375
The-- The president?

45:42.458 --> 45:45.166
For the fucking
President of the United States.

45:54.791 --> 45:56.375
So, what happened in Phoenix?

46:03.750 --> 46:05.083
Uh...

46:07.083 --> 46:08.166
Um...

46:09.791 --> 46:10.625
Well?

46:16.458 --> 46:18.583
Upon interviewing Max Meladze,

46:19.750 --> 46:22.416
I feel that
her threat of graymail is credible

46:23.083 --> 46:25.916
and requires further investigation.

46:31.416 --> 46:32.250
Okay.

46:33.750 --> 46:34.666
Keep me posted.

47:45.666 --> 47:48.541
-Hello?
-<i>I'm gonna ask you one question.</i>

47:52.583 --> 47:55.083
And if you answer honestly,
I'll accept your offer.

47:58.291 --> 47:59.500
What's the question?

48:02.458 --> 48:03.416
Can I trust you?

48:05.958 --> 48:07.458
When our interests align.

48:07.958 --> 48:08.791
Otherwise, no.

48:11.125 --> 48:11.958
I'm in.

48:27.708 --> 48:31.041
You already pissed off
the Senate Intelligence Committee.

48:31.125 --> 48:32.416
It's the least of my issues.

48:32.500 --> 48:36.000
Since I met you, I've been chased,
tortured, and subpoenaed.

48:36.083 --> 48:39.708
You're being followed
by the entire United Nations.

48:40.791 --> 48:43.458
-Get this under control.
-Yes, sir.

48:45.333 --> 48:46.791
Ever had a panic attack?

48:46.875 --> 48:49.541
I've had one since 2019.
You get used to it.

48:49.625 --> 48:52.416
You have a plan of action
for this woman or not?

48:54.541 --> 48:55.750
No, not yet.

48:57.125 --> 48:59.125
Higher stakes make it challenging.

48:59.208 --> 49:04.208
But as soon as I figure out the system,
I'll be able to navigate the obstacles.

49:04.291 --> 49:07.708
I'm 24, I'm supposed to make mistakes,
take big swings.

49:07.791 --> 49:10.041
-Martini?
-How about a White Claw?

49:11.375 --> 49:14.416
Inserting yourself in my operation
without notifying me?

49:14.500 --> 49:18.000
Wanna climb in so the whole world
doesn't see through our covert clown car?

49:22.250 --> 49:23.666
I'm just a lawyer.

49:30.333 --> 49:31.541
Is that a piña colada?

49:31.625 --> 49:32.583
Yeah.
