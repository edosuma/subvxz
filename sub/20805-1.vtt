As I was leaving
my hotel this morning,

02:12.265 --> 02:15.063
the doorman asked me,

02:16.136 --> 02:18.331
''Where are you
bound for, sir?''

02:18.438 --> 02:21.271
When I replied,
''West Point,''

02:22.742 --> 02:26.473
he remarked,
''It's a beautiful place.

been there before?''

Duty, Honor, Country.

02:45.865 --> 02:50.768

reverently dictate...

02:50.870 --> 02:53.600
what you ought to be,

02:53.706 --> 02:56.004
what you can be...

02:56.075 --> 02:58.305
and what you will be.

02:58.378 --> 03:01.313
They are your
rallying points.

03:01.347 --> 03:03.941
They give you
a temper of the will,

03:04.017 --> 03:06.713
a quality of
the imagination,

03:06.753 --> 03:09.313
a vigor of
the emotions,

03:09.355 --> 03:13.223
a freshness of
the deep springs of life,

03:13.259 --> 03:17.923
a temperamental predominance
of courage over timidity,

03:18.031 --> 03:21.023
an appetite
for adventure...

03:21.067 --> 03:23.831
over love of ease.

03:23.937 --> 03:28.772
In this way, they will teach you
to be an officer...

03:28.841 --> 03:30.775
and a gentleman.

03:30.843 --> 03:35.473
From your ranks come the great

those magic words:

04:04.110 --> 04:08.410
Duty, Honor, Country!

04:09.549 --> 04:12.712
This does not mean
that you are warmongers.

04:12.819 --> 04:16.755
On the contrary, the soldier,
above all other people,

04:16.822 --> 04:19.553

You said you wanted
to talk over
the Corregidor problem.

07:11.731 --> 07:15.633
I certainly do.
I've gone out on a limb
with the Filipinos.

made it?

One ship has reached Mindanao,
two more made it to Cebu.

07:26.546 --> 07:28.810

sunk or captured.
Thank you.

07:28.915 --> 07:31.110
So far we've lost better
than 80,000 tons.

07:31.217 --> 07:33.447

MacArthur has received
practically nothing.

they hold out?

than Pearl Harbor.

the whole North American
continent for a target...

what's going to happen.

is a figment of my imagination,

of hot coffee
up forward, sir.

21:49.975 --> 21:52.569
Would you
like some?
No coffee!

21:53.679 --> 21:56.079
How do you feel,
sir?

21:57.582 --> 21:59.516
I'm not exactly
a navy man, Phil.

22:00.952 --> 22:04.410
Well, when we get to Australia,
the commissioner of railways...

22:04.456 --> 22:08.517
has ordered his own personal car
for your trip to Melbourne.

22:11.830 --> 22:14.526
Anything
I can do, sir?

22:15.634 --> 22:17.534
Can't sleep.

22:18.837 --> 22:21.931
We're safe.
They're doomed!

22:23.475 --> 22:25.443
I know what
they're saying.

22:25.477 --> 22:28.378
''Dugout Doug MacArthur
lies a-shakin' on the Rock,

22:28.447 --> 22:32.349
safe from any danger
and any sudden shock.''

22:32.384 --> 22:34.352
I've heard that song.

22:34.386 --> 22:38.049
Well, I'm sure that the men
who thought that one up...

22:38.090 --> 22:40.888
were just blowin'
off steam, sir.

22:42.761 --> 22:45.559
I'm only thankful my father
isn't alive to hear it.

22:57.476 --> 22:59.376
Sir!

23:01.947 --> 23:04.415

23:28.240 --> 23:30.640
I knew the train
would be the best.

23:30.675 --> 23:33.439
This is the first time
he's really slept
since Pearl Harbor.

23:33.545 --> 23:35.445

23:51.963 --> 23:55.558
Good crowd, and it looks like
all the Australian brass
you want to talk to...

23:55.667 --> 23:57.862
are out there
waiting for you, sir.

23:57.903 --> 24:00.599
All I see is people.
Where are the kangaroos?

24:00.705 --> 24:03.299
I'm sure we'll see
some soon, dear.

24:07.212 --> 24:11.342
[Man] What I'd like to have
is a public address system
by the back there.

24:16.121 --> 24:20.057
[Crowd Cheering,

24:34.539 --> 24:37.440
Hello, Dick.
Do you have a report for me?

24:37.542 --> 24:42.070
Ah, yes, I do, but...
but there's
a crowd waiting.

24:42.147 --> 24:45.139
Why don't you go out,
and I'll brief you
in the hotel.

24:46.251 --> 24:50.381
Well, good news can wait,
bad news can't.

24:50.455 --> 24:52.389
Let's have it.

24:55.760 --> 24:57.694
Well, sir,

24:58.763 --> 25:01.891
I, uh...

25:02.000 --> 25:04.901
Nobody knows anything about
a Philippine relief expedition.

25:06.004 --> 25:07.904
I'm sorry.

25:08.006 --> 25:12.807
In the whole of Australia,
there is a grand total
of some 30,000 U.S. Personnel,

25:12.844 --> 25:15.108
mostly artillery
and engineers,

25:15.146 --> 25:17.410
scattered all over
the continent.

25:18.650 --> 25:21.915
At present,
there's no American infantry.

25:22.020 --> 25:23.920
Air units?

25:24.022 --> 25:27.617
There are about 250 planes
of all types...

25:27.726 --> 25:29.751
more or less
in commission.

25:29.828 --> 25:32.262
Sixty-five of them
are undergoing repairs,

25:32.330 --> 25:35.265
a hundred and twenty-two
of them are being assembled.

25:35.333 --> 25:37.267
There's almost
no navy at all.

25:37.335 --> 25:39.963
[MacArthur]
And no infantry.
God help us.

25:40.071 --> 25:43.234
Well, there are approximately
300,000 Australian troops,

25:43.341 --> 25:47.175
but they've been described as
undertrained and underequipped.

25:47.245 --> 25:49.270
You know what that means.

25:49.347 --> 25:53.784
Not only is the Bataan
rescue mission so much
blue sky over the horizon,

25:53.852 --> 25:57.344
it is even open to question
if we can defend Australia.

25:57.389 --> 25:59.584

MacArthur! MacArthur!

25:59.658 --> 26:01.785
Ready to go, Daddy?
Shh.

26:01.893 --> 26:04.521
However, there is
one more thing, sir.

26:04.596 --> 26:07.190
Headquarters
here at Melbourne
has received...

26:07.299 --> 26:10.234
a message for you from
President Roosevelt.

26:11.536 --> 26:14.630
He has awarded you
the Medal of Honor.

You know, my father...

26:37.629 --> 26:40.826

when he was only 19.

26:40.932 --> 26:42.923

from a low angle?

that effect very much.

27:50.535 --> 27:54.767
[Cheering Continues]

27:59.177 --> 28:02.874
The president of the
United States ordered me...

28:02.981 --> 28:05.506
to break through
the Japanese lines...

28:05.583 --> 28:10.282
and proceed from Corregidor
to Australia...

28:10.388 --> 28:12.515
for the purpose
of organizing...

28:12.590 --> 28:15.821
the American offensive
against Japan,

28:15.894 --> 28:18.385
a primary object of which...

28:18.496 --> 28:21.397
is the retaking
of the Philippines.

28:22.834 --> 28:25.394
I came through...

28:25.437 --> 28:27.837
and I shall return.

28:37.115 --> 28:39.913
[Over Radio]
This is General
Wainwright speaking.

28:39.951 --> 28:42.317
Subject: Surrender.

28:42.420 --> 28:46.823
To put a stop to further
useless sacrifice of human life,

28:46.925 --> 28:48.825
I've decided to accept,

28:48.927 --> 28:51.725
in the name of humanity,
the formal surrender...

28:51.830 --> 28:55.630
of all American and Philippine
army troops...

28:55.667 --> 28:57.828
in the Philippine Islands.

28:57.936 --> 29:02.771
It became apparent
that the garrisons
would be eventually destroyed.

29:02.807 --> 29:06.174
This dissension
was forced upon me...

29:06.211 --> 29:09.510
by means entirely
beyond my control.

29:09.581 --> 29:12.573
Let me emphasize there
must be no thought whatever...

29:12.684 --> 29:15.585
of disregarding
these instructions.

29:15.687 --> 29:19.179
My assistant chief of staff
will repeat the complete text...

29:19.290 --> 29:23.727
of this letter by radio
to General MacArthur.

29:23.795 --> 29:26.229
[MacArthur]
It's a trick!
It's a Japanese deception!

29:26.297 --> 29:29.095
No, sir.
Everyone recognized
the general's voice.

29:29.134 --> 29:32.535
He struck Old Glory
and ran up a bedsheet!

29:32.637 --> 29:35.936
By what authority does he issue
such an unlawful order?

29:36.007 --> 29:37.941
He's the acting commander.

29:38.009 --> 29:41.001
The only possible
explanation is that
he's temporarily deranged.

29:41.045 --> 29:44.014
For that reason alone,
his orders have no validity.

29:44.048 --> 29:47.415
I place no credence
on this alleged broadcast.

29:47.452 --> 29:51.149
Everybody up there believed him,
the Japanese included!
The conditions...

29:51.222 --> 29:53.656
If it's true, then we
should get back at once.

29:53.725 --> 29:56.353
It's not too late to join
the guerrillas on Luzon.

29:56.427 --> 29:58.361
General, you-you
can't be serious.

29:58.429 --> 30:00.624
They-They won't be
organized for months.

30:00.732 --> 30:03.860
Now, we both know that
Wainwright could not
hold on indefinitely.

30:03.935 --> 30:06.028
He was not asked
to hold on indefinitely!

30:06.137 --> 30:09.334
His job was to
defend the island
until help arrived!

30:09.440 --> 30:12.534
That was his assignment.
He had no supplies,
no food left!

30:12.644 --> 30:15.169
The malaria was
totally out of hand.

30:15.246 --> 30:18.044
If he had tried to
hold out one more day,

30:18.149 --> 30:20.549
we would've had
a dreadful massacre.

just a matter of time.

He'll call back later.

31:07.632 --> 31:10.624
There's some talk
in Washington about...

31:10.735 --> 31:13.329
a Medal of Honor
for Wainwright.

31:14.772 --> 31:16.740
They want you
to recommend it.

31:20.445 --> 31:22.379
Medal of Honor?

31:27.986 --> 31:30.045
If Wainwright
received it,

31:30.154 --> 31:34.250
it would constitute
an injustice to others
who have done far more.

31:40.865 --> 31:43.857
Send the following radio
to General Marshall.

31:43.902 --> 31:47.303
''I believe that Wainwright has
become temporarily unbalanced,

31:47.405 --> 31:51.603
and that his condition renders
him susceptible of enemy use.''

is well and good,
but it's not enough.

until their first battle.

have the transport...

32:11.629 --> 32:14.154
to supply a single division
for 24 hours.

32:14.232 --> 32:16.427
Hell, I can't even
land 'em on the beach.

32:16.534 --> 32:20.026

action from you,
not complaints.

32:20.138 --> 32:23.039
If I don't get going,
the navy's gonna
win this war.

32:23.141 --> 32:26.338
Look what Nimitz did up
at Coral Sea and Midway.

32:26.377 --> 32:28.345
I know you don't have
everything you need.

32:28.379 --> 32:30.347
Sir, if I could just have
a little more time...

32:30.381 --> 32:32.349
That's because our
friends in Washington...

32:32.383 --> 32:34.874
are sending it all
to George Patton
in North Africa,

32:34.953 --> 32:37.945
so he can run around
in the desert, fighting
a seesaw tank battle.

32:37.989 --> 32:40.457
If I could just have...
Sid, I want to see
my new air commander.

33:05.817 --> 33:07.808
It flew in from the States
this morning.

33:07.852 --> 33:10.616
We're puttin' together several
squadrons up in Brisbane.

33:10.655 --> 33:12.919
Good! How soon can you
get 'em in the air?

33:12.957 --> 33:15.755
Soon enough to get
the enemy off our back,

33:15.827 --> 33:18.523
and maybe go kick his butt
for a change.

33:18.629 --> 33:21.928
Good, good!
My boys say
you can't do it.

33:21.966 --> 33:23.957
Well, your boys
aren't fliers.

33:24.035 --> 33:25.969
Give me five days
to prepare,

33:26.070 --> 33:29.471
and I'll ship the whole goddamn
United States Army
to New Guinea by air.

33:29.540 --> 33:32.168
[Chuckles]
Really?

33:32.276 --> 33:34.972
- My staff hear about this?
- I doubt it.

33:35.046 --> 33:37.844
Don't tell 'em.
You'll scare 'em half to death!

33:37.882 --> 33:39.850

34:16.621 --> 34:19.054
[Man]
And you ram it
right down his throat!

34:19.123 --> 34:23.025
The recent bombings of our
northern airfields give us
every reason to believe...

34:23.061 --> 34:28.966
that the nips' next move
will be a massive invasion
of the Australian continent.

34:29.033 --> 34:31.763
The garrison at Darwin,
up here,

34:31.835 --> 34:35.397
doesn't have enough troops
to hold for more than 48 hours.

34:35.540 --> 34:39.476
So our best plan, therefore,
is to show token resistance...

34:39.577 --> 34:43.638
and fall back rapidly to this,
the Brisbane Line.

34:43.681 --> 34:48.380
To the north, the enemy
will find only burnt offerings.

34:48.453 --> 34:51.478
Meanwhile in the southeast,
we will throw everything...

34:51.556 --> 34:55.652
into the fight for the cities
and the farmlands around them.

34:55.760 --> 34:58.558
This is the living heart
of Australia,

34:58.596 --> 35:01.292
and we shall defend it
with our lives.

- General.
- Thank you.

35:05.636 --> 35:07.604
Gentlemen,

35:10.241 --> 35:12.209
I've been deeply moved...

35:12.243 --> 35:14.234
and deeply stirred...

35:15.346 --> 35:17.837
by the allied efforts,

35:17.915 --> 35:20.509
and by the courage
and determination
of the Australians...

35:20.618 --> 35:23.951
as expressed by
General Blamey, but...

35:24.021 --> 35:27.821
as supreme commander of
the southwest Pacific area,

35:27.892 --> 35:31.157
I will not be the leader
of another lost cause.

35:31.229 --> 35:34.858
We are attacking, gentlemen.

35:34.932 --> 35:38.231
I am going to make
the fight for Australia...

[Tokyo Rose]
Hey, Joe,
whatcha doing out here?

35:54.752 --> 35:58.552
You should be home on the farm
walking with your girl,

35:58.656 --> 36:01.784
getting your chores done
and sitting down to supper.

36:01.859 --> 36:05.090
Or maybe you should
be taking in a show,

36:05.129 --> 36:07.620
walking down Broadway,
sipping Coke.

36:08.866 --> 36:12.097
Thejungle's where we live.
It's where you die.

36:14.305 --> 36:16.239
[MacArthur]
Bob, I sent for you...

36:16.307 --> 36:18.605
because I don't think
you like a stalemate
any better than I do,

36:18.709 --> 36:21.109
and that's what we've got
here in New Guinea.

36:21.212 --> 36:25.706
They tell me that American boys
are actually throwing away
their rifles and turning tail.

36:25.750 --> 36:28.218
That hasn't happened since
the first battle of Bull Run.

36:28.319 --> 36:30.116
I want you
to relieve Harding.

36:30.154 --> 36:32.816
This isn't
the Civil War, General.

36:32.857 --> 36:35.325
Harding's a good man,
he's a good officer.

36:35.359 --> 36:38.522
- It's just that
he's up against...
- I'm sending you in, Bob.

36:38.563 --> 36:40.827
I want you to remove
all officers who won't fight.

36:40.932 --> 36:43.332
If necessary, put sergeants
in charge of battalions...

36:43.434 --> 36:45.664
and corporals in charge
of companies.

36:45.770 --> 36:47.738
Anyone who will fight.

36:47.772 --> 36:50.240
I want you to take Buna
or don't come back alive,

36:50.274 --> 36:52.834

the Joint Chiefs of Staff...

47:36.453 --> 47:39.911
have been considering
for about a year,
without a decision,

47:40.023 --> 47:42.958
the next step to be taken
in the Pacific war.

47:43.026 --> 47:46.257

would like to hear firsthand...

47:46.330 --> 47:49.561
the views of his commanders
in chief in the field.

47:49.633 --> 47:53.660
Admiral Nimitz, would you
please present the plan prepared
by you and Admiral King.

47:53.770 --> 47:55.829
Yes, sir.

47:55.939 --> 47:58.840
In our westward drive
across the Pacific,

47:58.942 --> 48:01.172
the navy's
consistent goal...

48:01.278 --> 48:04.611
has been to cut Japan's
line of communication.

48:04.681 --> 48:07.115
Now, as you know, the central
Pacific offensives...

48:07.184 --> 48:11.985
have taken under control
the Gilbert, the Marshall,
and the Mariana Island groups.

48:12.022 --> 48:15.583
In our view,
the sound strategy
for early victory...

48:15.692 --> 48:20.129
is to occupy the western Pacific
and seize Formosa,

48:20.197 --> 48:22.529
both to control
the Formosa Strait...

48:22.599 --> 48:25.432
and as a jumping-off point
against Japan.

48:25.502 --> 48:29.131
Now, this means bypassing...

48:29.239 --> 48:31.799
the main Philippine island
of Luzon...

48:31.909 --> 48:34.343
until Formosa is secured.

48:34.411 --> 48:37.141
After General MacArthur's
troops...

48:37.214 --> 48:39.614
have seized
the southern Philippines,

48:39.716 --> 48:42.810
the access of advance
that should get
the highest priority...

48:42.920 --> 48:46.014
is the central Pacific offensive
toward Formosa.

48:46.056 --> 48:49.423
General MacArthur
could then move into Luzon...

48:49.459 --> 48:53.259
and recapture Manila after
my forces have taken Formosa.

48:53.330 --> 48:57.027
In fact,
with the fall of Japan,

48:57.134 --> 48:59.261
the liberation
of the northern Philippines,

48:59.336 --> 49:01.270
including Manila,

49:01.371 --> 49:04.363
will follow de facto, without
any need for force of arms.

49:04.408 --> 49:07.775
We therefore propose
to invade Formosa...

49:07.811 --> 49:10.177
at the earliest
opportunity.

49:10.280 --> 49:12.475
And my planners
are convinced...

49:12.582 --> 49:16.109
that a target date
of March 1, '45,

49:16.186 --> 49:18.120
is not unreasonable.

49:20.190 --> 49:23.182
Well, Douglas,
how does it sound to you?

49:31.501 --> 49:35.130
I'm a soldier, and I'll
hold the horse if so ordered.

49:36.707 --> 49:40.404
To bypass isolated islands
is one thing,

49:40.444 --> 49:43.208
but to leave
in your rear...

49:43.246 --> 49:47.012
250,000
Japanese troops...

49:47.117 --> 49:49.711
drawing their sustenance
from the Philippines,

49:49.820 --> 49:52.812
involves serious
and unnecessary risks.

49:52.923 --> 49:56.256
From Luzon,
I can clamp a blockade...

49:56.326 --> 49:59.318
on all supplies
from the south to Japan,

49:59.429 --> 50:02.227
thus forcing her
to an early capitulation.

50:02.332 --> 50:04.926
Therefore, I propose...

50:05.035 --> 50:08.061
that we land
at Leyte Beach on Luzon,

50:08.171 --> 50:10.731
and then carry
the fight to Manila.

50:10.841 --> 50:14.743
Given a successful landing,
aren't you afraid of a long
and bloody campaign?

50:14.845 --> 50:18.281
With the kind of
performance and support...

50:18.382 --> 50:21.476
provided thus far
by the navy,

50:21.551 --> 50:23.485
I can be in Manila
in five weeks...

50:23.553 --> 50:26.647
from the day my troops
step ashore on the beaches,

50:26.690 --> 50:28.658
and well before
next March.

50:28.692 --> 50:31.160
General, how can
you say that?

50:31.261 --> 50:34.355
Because for two years, Filipino
guerrillas have been working...

50:34.464 --> 50:38.491
behind the Japanese lines to
set the stage for our landings.

50:38.568 --> 50:42.095
It's your position to know,
but I can't conscientiously
agree with this estimate.

50:42.205 --> 50:45.606
To take Luzon would
demand heavier losses
than we can stand.

50:45.675 --> 50:47.609
It seems to me
we should bypass it.

50:47.677 --> 50:50.407
In my two years of fighting
in the southwest Pacific area,

50:50.480 --> 50:52.414
and they have been
long, hard years,

50:52.482 --> 50:56.976
fewer Americans
have been killed than
in the single battle of Anzio.

50:57.087 --> 50:59.817
The days of the frontal
attack are over.

50:59.890 --> 51:02.859
Only your mediocre
commanders use it.

51:02.926 --> 51:06.555
Your good commanders
do not turn in heavy losses.

51:06.630 --> 51:11.124
[Roosevelt] Douglas,
Admiral Nimitz's victories
have been no less than your own.

51:11.234 --> 51:14.761
Franklin, all the years
we've known each other,

51:14.871 --> 51:19.035
I don't believe
I told you how my father
won his Medal of Honor.

51:19.142 --> 51:22.134
No, you never did.
But you're about to
do it now, aren't you?

51:23.747 --> 51:27.046
It was during the Battle
of Missionary Ridge.

51:27.150 --> 51:29.744
At the height of the fighting,
he saw the flag go down.

51:29.786 --> 51:32.448
As others around him faltered,
he seized up the colors...

51:32.489 --> 51:34.753
and rallied
the troops to victory.

51:37.461 --> 51:40.589
Admiral Nimitz is one
of our greatest admirals.

51:40.664 --> 51:44.760
But just now,
as I listened to the plan,

51:44.801 --> 51:47.668
I thought I saw our flag
going down.

51:47.771 --> 51:50.467
Oh, did you?

51:50.574 --> 51:53.168
Mr. President,
had we the will to do so,

51:53.276 --> 51:56.973
we could have saved Bataan and
Corregidor in the first place!

51:57.013 --> 52:00.642
To sacrifice Luzon a second time
cannot be condoned or forgiven.

52:00.717 --> 52:02.708
My dear General,

52:02.752 --> 52:05.721
bypassing Luzon is not
synonymous with sacrificing...

52:05.822 --> 52:10.657
But bypassing Luzon
has implications
which stain American honor.

52:10.727 --> 52:15.027
Do you realize what
theJapanese propagandists are
telling the Filipino people?

52:15.132 --> 52:17.123
That Americans will never
shed their blood...

52:17.167 --> 52:19.727
to save the colored peoples
of the earth!

52:19.769 --> 52:22.169
Your zeal is understandable.
I admire it.

52:22.272 --> 52:25.139
But we can't
let it interfere...

52:25.175 --> 52:27.643
with a workable
Pacific strategy.

52:33.884 --> 52:37.285
''I give to the Philippines
my solemn pledge...

52:37.354 --> 52:40.289
''that their freedom
will be redeemed.

52:40.357 --> 52:43.758
''Entire resources
of men and material
of the United States...

52:43.860 --> 52:45.851
stand behind that pledge.''

52:47.297 --> 52:50.357
Your words, sir.

52:53.770 --> 52:55.670
Mr. President,

52:55.772 --> 52:58.263
General MacArthur's points
are well taken,

52:58.375 --> 53:02.744
and I'm sure that
the Joint Chiefs will wish
to consider them very carefully.

53:02.812 --> 53:04.746
I shall return.

53:04.814 --> 53:08.614
I am going back there next fall
if I have to paddle a canoe.

53:08.652 --> 53:13.021
If your decision be
to bypass Luzon with
its millions of people,

53:13.123 --> 53:16.115
thousands of American
prisoners of war,

53:16.159 --> 53:20.220
to continue to languish there
in agony and despair,

53:21.631 --> 53:25.260
I daresay that the American
public would be so aroused...

53:25.335 --> 53:30.170
that they would register
complete resentment against you
at the polls next fall.

53:34.377 --> 53:37.835
Arthur!
Arthur Prettyman!

53:37.948 --> 53:42.078
[Roosevelt]
Get me an aspirin tablet.
No, no, make it two.

53:42.152 --> 53:47.249
Nobody can talk me
into a headache the way
General MacArthur can.

53:47.290 --> 53:50.555
Gentlemen, I think
it's time to call a recess.

53:50.594 --> 53:53.392
It's been a fatiguing day.
Indeed it has, sir.

53:53.463 --> 53:56.159
Recess was my favorite time
in school.

53:56.199 --> 53:58.667
It's getting
to be that way in war.

54:00.303 --> 54:02.237
[Roosevelt Coughing]

54:02.305 --> 54:05.604
Douglas.
Yes, Mr. President?

54:05.709 --> 54:08.337
Why haven't you come home
all these years?

54:08.411 --> 54:11.847
Well, I've had
my hands full out here.

54:13.016 --> 54:16.247
The country
has evolved,

54:16.319 --> 54:18.253
grown mature.

54:18.321 --> 54:20.846
Change is inevitable,
you know.

54:22.025 --> 54:25.222
The things I value
never change.

54:25.262 --> 54:28.925
My only regret is that my son
has never seen his country.

54:28.965 --> 54:31.058
He's never been home.

54:32.135 --> 54:34.126
Where is that
for you?

54:36.139 --> 54:38.630
Well, in a sense,
the army is home.

54:39.743 --> 54:41.973
Even my swaddling clothes
were khaki.

54:45.248 --> 54:47.842
Mainly l...

54:47.884 --> 54:50.148
I think of West Point
as home.

54:50.253 --> 54:52.380
The lecture halls,

54:52.455 --> 54:55.083
the football fields
where I became a man.

54:55.158 --> 54:57.956
And l...

54:58.061 --> 55:02.225
I also see a terrace
overlooking Manila Bay.

55:02.299 --> 55:04.597
Yes, the Philippines
are also home.

55:06.736 --> 55:09.637
I appreciate and understand
your feelings, Douglas.

55:11.207 --> 55:14.506
Now, I shall inform
the Joint Chiefs of Staff,

55:14.544 --> 55:18.605
upon my return home,
that I have had two
excellent briefings.

55:18.648 --> 55:21.515
I'm sure they'll be
both pleased and delighted.

55:21.618 --> 55:23.916
And I shall ask them to make
their decision promptly.

55:25.021 --> 55:27.012
Thank you.

55:27.123 --> 55:30.320
I'd like to return to my command
as soon as possible.

55:30.427 --> 55:32.918
For 40 years,
I've held a firm conviction...

55:32.962 --> 55:35.931
that a commander's place
is at the scene of the battle.

55:36.032 --> 55:38.159
I agree with you
entirely, Douglas.

55:38.234 --> 55:40.634
That is why I am here.

55:50.146 --> 55:53.240
[Man]
''Southwest Pacific forces...

55:53.350 --> 55:55.580
''to invade Leyte.

55:57.153 --> 56:01.783
Target date
advanced to 20 October. ''

56:01.825 --> 56:04.225
Hot damn, we got it!

56:04.294 --> 56:06.228
This'll make
the old man happy.

56:06.296 --> 56:09.288
He'll be returning
to the Philippines two months
earlier than he expected.

56:09.332 --> 56:11.800
Sergeant, I want you to get this
out immediately, if not sooner,

56:11.835 --> 56:13.803
to all top command
headquarters.

56:53.343 --> 56:55.777
Good morning, sir.
Good morning,
General.

56:55.845 --> 56:58.245
Earplugs, sir.
Thank you.

56:59.582 --> 57:03.382
Good morning,
Mr. President.
Good morning, General.

57:03.420 --> 57:07.083
President Osmena,
earplugs for your ears.
Thank you.

58:06.983 --> 58:10.009
I hope to hell they do
as well on the beaches
as they did in training.

58:10.086 --> 58:12.486
I don't think
you have to worry
about that, General.

58:12.522 --> 58:14.820
I know the 5th Cavalry.

58:14.891 --> 58:18.793
When I was a little boy,
my father was a captain
at Fort Selden,

58:18.895 --> 58:21.591
New Mexico territory.

58:21.631 --> 58:25.795
Geronimo, the Apache scourge,
was on the loose,

58:25.902 --> 58:29.895
and it was a troop
from this same 5th Cavalry
that rode through to help us.

58:30.006 --> 58:32.998
They fought then.
They'll fight now.

58:33.910 --> 58:35.810
And they'll win.

58:41.050 --> 58:43.518
Look at that, Mr. President.

58:43.620 --> 58:46.453
The second wave
is going in upright.

58:46.523 --> 58:49.617
Our intelligence reports
said the Japanese wouldn't
let us on the beach.

58:49.726 --> 58:53.958
But just look at those boys!
Nothing will stop them!

59:29.599 --> 59:32.500
Where's my landing craft?
I'm going ashore.

59:32.602 --> 59:35.093
I had it delayed, sir.
Heavy enemy mortar fire
on the beach.

59:35.204 --> 59:37.399
I felt it was unsafe for
the commander in chief...

59:37.507 --> 59:40.908
The landing craft,
Captain.
Aye, aye, sir.

01:00:02.231 --> 01:00:04.927
President Osmena,
you're home at last.

01:00:12.141 --> 01:00:14.075
Follow me.

01:00:14.143 --> 01:00:17.442
Correspondents, please
stay in the rear until after
the general makes his statement.

01:00:17.480 --> 01:00:20.847
No questions...
Gerry, where are you
going with that?

01:00:20.950 --> 01:00:23.350
I'm gonna get a better shot
down the beach, sir.

01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:27.287
I want that camera where it was.
I wanna see that wreckage
in the background.

01:00:27.357 --> 01:00:30.793
The general will think
this smoke is marvelous!

01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:32.794
Get back.
Correspondents, back.

01:00:32.862 --> 01:00:34.796
Low angle, remember.

01:00:40.069 --> 01:00:43.300
Right over there.
Stay.

01:00:49.379 --> 01:00:51.313
You see, General,

01:00:51.381 --> 01:00:54.908
my people are going to laugh
if I fell in deep water.

01:00:54.984 --> 01:00:58.784
I cannot swim!
That's not so bad,
Mr. President.

01:00:58.821 --> 01:01:02.154
Everyone's about to see
that I can't walk on water.

01:01:46.302 --> 01:01:49.362
People of the Philippines,

01:01:50.606 --> 01:01:53.166
I have returned.

01:01:54.277 --> 01:01:57.804
By the grace
of Almighty God,

01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:01.407
our forces
stand again...

01:02:01.517 --> 01:02:03.815
on Philippine soil.

01:02:05.154 --> 01:02:08.521
The hour of your
redemption is here.

01:02:08.558 --> 01:02:10.526
Rally to me.

01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:12.528
Let the indomitable spirit...

01:02:12.562 --> 01:02:17.226
of Bataan and Corregidor
lead on.

01:02:17.266 --> 01:02:20.633
As the lines of battle
roll forward,

01:02:20.670 --> 01:02:23.230
rise and strike...

01:02:23.339 --> 01:02:26.274
for your homes and hearts.

01:02:26.342 --> 01:02:28.333
Strike...

01:02:28.444 --> 01:02:30.469
for future generations...

01:02:30.546 --> 01:02:33.242
of your sons and daughters.

01:02:33.282 --> 01:02:36.547
Strike in the name...

01:02:36.652 --> 01:02:38.745
of your sacred dead.

01:02:38.855 --> 01:02:43.258
Strike!
Let no heart be faint.

01:02:43.292 --> 01:02:46.659
Let every arm be steel!

01:02:46.763 --> 01:02:51.666
The divine guidance of God
points the way.

01:02:51.701 --> 01:02:57.503
Follow in His name
to the Holy Grail
of righteous victory!

01:03:06.015 --> 01:03:09.849
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hold it! Hold it!

01:03:09.919 --> 01:03:12.854
General, sir, you've
arrived at the front lines.

01:03:12.922 --> 01:03:16.255
Well, I see our boys
fully 100 yards
up ahead.

01:03:16.325 --> 01:03:19.624
Sir, that's only
a forward patrol.
The men are under enemy fire.

01:03:19.662 --> 01:03:23.621
You'd be in extreme hazard
if you go on up
past this point.

01:03:23.666 --> 01:03:25.657
There's Japs
right up there.

01:03:25.735 --> 01:03:28.329
You can't fight 'em
if you can't see 'em, son.

01:03:28.437 --> 01:03:30.371
Let's go.

01:03:35.044 --> 01:03:36.944
[Soldier]
I don't believe it.

01:03:37.046 --> 01:03:39.981
That's the first time
I've ever seen a commander
in chief take the point.

01:03:41.851 --> 01:03:44.752
Yeah, he's the
greatest general
since Sergeant York.

01:03:44.854 --> 01:03:47.652
[Gunfire]

01:03:47.690 --> 01:03:50.659
[Explosion]

01:04:02.038 --> 01:04:05.098
Cease fire!
Cease fire!

01:04:06.509 --> 01:04:08.409
Come on.

01:04:08.511 --> 01:04:10.411
Will you look at him?

01:04:10.513 --> 01:04:12.413
Does he really think
that he can't get hurt?

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:15.348
Goddamn it,
of course he does!

01:04:15.418 --> 01:04:18.114
I've got a little surprise
for the general.

01:04:21.224 --> 01:04:23.317
Morning, gentlemen.
Good morning, sir.

01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:26.328
Sir,

01:04:26.429 --> 01:04:28.329
pursuant to
an act of Congress,

01:04:28.431 --> 01:04:30.922
you have been promoted
to the rank of
General of the Army.

01:04:31.033 --> 01:04:35.026
Such promotion
to take effect
18 December, 1944,

01:04:35.137 --> 01:04:37.037
by order of
the president.

01:04:37.139 --> 01:04:41.041
Sir, we thought that you should
get these on as soon as you can.

01:04:41.143 --> 01:04:43.373
[Explosion]

01:04:43.446 --> 01:04:46.347
[Man]
You got your fifth
star, General.

01:04:46.382 --> 01:04:50.375
Well, I have no objections.
I like the look of'em.

01:04:50.453 --> 01:04:53.251
Congratulations,
sir.
Thank you, Court.

01:04:58.761 --> 01:05:00.626
[MacArthur]
I think it would
be a good idea...

01:05:00.696 --> 01:05:03.995
to take that mortar out
before someone gets hurt.

01:05:37.967 --> 01:05:41.061
Follow me. Come around
so we can get the general.

01:05:41.170 --> 01:05:44.628
[Prisoners Cheering]

01:05:50.646 --> 01:05:53.774
So good to see you, General.
Finally returned,
but a little late.

01:05:53.849 --> 01:05:57.376
So good to see you.
Thank you.

01:05:59.155 --> 01:06:01.521
Get me some more shots
of these people.

01:06:05.695 --> 01:06:09.131
Hello, sonny.
Aah.

01:06:09.198 --> 01:06:12.292
You know, I've got a boy at home
just about your size.

01:06:12.335 --> 01:06:15.099
I have.
Here we are.

01:06:15.204 --> 01:06:17.001
[Man]
Nice going, General.

01:06:17.106 --> 01:06:19.540
Survivors of the
death march are in here.

01:06:19.608 --> 01:06:22.805
[Cheering]

01:06:28.351 --> 01:06:31.616
[Clapping,
Chattering]

01:06:35.858 --> 01:06:37.826
[Coughing]

01:06:40.029 --> 01:06:42.327
General, you really
made it back.

01:06:44.533 --> 01:06:46.524
Oh, I'm never gonna
forget this.

01:06:46.569 --> 01:06:49.231
We're long overdue, sir.
Long overdue.
It's okay.

01:06:49.338 --> 01:06:53.035
We knew you'd come back, sir.
We knew you wouldn't forget us.
Thank you.

01:06:53.142 --> 01:06:55.042
We're a little late.
I'm sorry.

01:06:55.144 --> 01:06:58.238
Colonel Fox here, sir.
We're sure glad to see you, sir.

01:06:58.347 --> 01:07:00.508
We're a little late.
I'm sorry.
Yes, sir.

01:07:00.583 --> 01:07:02.676
General?
General?

01:07:02.718 --> 01:07:05.186
[Coughing]
General?

01:07:05.287 --> 01:07:07.312
Thank God you're here.

01:07:07.390 --> 01:07:10.018
We're long overdue.
Long overdue.

01:07:26.842 --> 01:07:30.300
- Pedro!
- Yes, sir.

01:07:30.413 --> 01:07:32.813
I'm sorry I'm so
unpresentable, sir.

01:07:46.629 --> 01:07:49.029
You never looked
so good to me, Castro.

01:08:10.786 --> 01:08:12.686
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:08:12.788 --> 01:08:14.881
if you've ever had
a load of hay fall on you,

01:08:14.924 --> 01:08:17.392
then you know
how I feel right now.

01:08:17.426 --> 01:08:21.385
I don't know if any of you pray,
but if you do, you could
pray God to help me.

01:08:22.698 --> 01:08:25.394
[Man]
Good luck, Mr. President.

01:08:25.434 --> 01:08:27.402
I wish you didn't
have to call me that.

01:08:27.435 --> 01:08:29.700
I never felt so out of place
in all my life.

01:08:29.805 --> 01:08:34.207
[Man On Radio]
Here is the caisson
of Franklin Delano Roosevelt,

01:08:34.310 --> 01:08:37.404
now making the turn
off of 15th Street...

01:08:37.513 --> 01:08:39.912
into Pennsylvania Avenue.

01:08:40.015 --> 01:08:42.813
God give me strength
to do this.

01:08:44.019 --> 01:08:47.819
And there is
the flag-draped coffin.

01:08:47.857 --> 01:08:52.920
The horses with black blankets
under their saddles.

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:55.522
The horses
on the right side,

01:08:55.564 --> 01:08:58.032
unmounted.

01:08:58.067 --> 01:09:00.501
And it's moving
ever so slowly...

01:09:00.603 --> 01:09:03.662
as the crowd stands...

01:09:03.772 --> 01:09:06.366
to pay their
last respects...

01:09:06.475 --> 01:09:10.206
to the man who was their leader,
their commander in chief,

01:09:10.279 --> 01:09:12.212
their friend.

01:09:14.283 --> 01:09:17.548
Mr. President.
Hello, General.

01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:20.612
We need your
authorization.
What have you got?

01:09:28.096 --> 01:09:30.031
Well, the President...

01:09:33.702 --> 01:09:35.636
Mr. Roosevelt
never told me.

01:09:36.138 --> 01:09:37.901
They never told me.

01:09:40.209 --> 01:09:42.904
We spent months
of staff time,

01:09:43.011 --> 01:09:45.446
tens of millions of dollars
in preparation...

01:09:45.514 --> 01:09:47.505
for the greatest invasion
in history,

01:09:47.582 --> 01:09:50.518
and when we're
primed and ready,

01:09:50.586 --> 01:09:53.020
they send
an air force officer...

01:09:53.055 --> 01:09:57.515
to tell me they've
constructed
this-this apparatus!

01:09:57.560 --> 01:10:00.324
General, what happens
if it doesn't work?

01:10:02.731 --> 01:10:04.926
What happens
if it does?

01:10:42.771 --> 01:10:44.864
[Knocking]
Yes?

01:10:44.974 --> 01:10:46.874
Excuse me.

01:10:46.976 --> 01:10:49.376
Admiral Halsey,
the representatives
are all on board, sir.

01:10:49.411 --> 01:10:53.177
The British commander
of Singapore has just been
released from a prison camp.

01:10:53.282 --> 01:10:55.978
Percival. Good, good.
What about that
Russian fellow?

01:10:56.085 --> 01:10:58.076
General Derevyanko.
He's here.

01:10:58.120 --> 01:11:00.088
[Chuckles]
What gall!

01:11:00.122 --> 01:11:03.558
The Soviets declared war after
we'd won it, and now they want
to horn in on the surrender.

01:11:03.626 --> 01:11:06.595
There's someone else
here too, sir.

01:11:18.173 --> 01:11:20.107
General.

01:11:32.855 --> 01:11:34.789
Jim.

01:11:36.125 --> 01:11:38.116
General.
Jim!

01:11:40.296 --> 01:11:42.560
I'm so glad to see you.

01:11:51.273 --> 01:11:54.299
General Wainwright,
I don't think you know
Admiral Halsey.

01:11:54.410 --> 01:11:56.776
Welcome aboard, sir.
Thank you, sir.

01:11:56.812 --> 01:11:59.076
Jonathan.
Good to see you.
Yes, of course.

01:11:59.148 --> 01:12:01.013
And Admiral Nimitz.

01:12:01.083 --> 01:12:02.948
General.
Admiral.

01:12:03.018 --> 01:12:05.009
Come and sit down,
Jim.

01:12:06.121 --> 01:12:08.521
I'm sorry.
No, don't talk
like that.

01:12:08.590 --> 01:12:13.027
I've disgraced you
and the army.
You have not.

01:12:13.062 --> 01:12:16.225
We were starving.
You don't have
to say anything, Jim.

01:12:17.333 --> 01:12:19.733
I had to shoot my horse.

01:12:20.969 --> 01:12:23.938
I realize they'll never
restore me to active duty.

01:12:23.972 --> 01:12:27.430
That's not true, Jim.
You can have
whatever you want.

01:12:31.347 --> 01:12:34.839
Command of a corps.
That's all I want.

01:12:36.485 --> 01:12:41.184
Your old corps is yours
whenever you're ready,
General.

01:12:47.262 --> 01:12:49.560
[Camera Shutter Clicking]

01:13:20.529 --> 01:13:22.463
Sid.
Yes, sir?

01:13:22.531 --> 01:13:25.125
What did I do
with Jean's pen?

01:13:25.167 --> 01:13:27.135
Here we go, sir.

01:13:42.451 --> 01:13:44.385
[MacArthur]
We are gathered here,

01:13:44.453 --> 01:13:46.444
representatives
of the major warring powers,

01:13:46.555 --> 01:13:52.255
to conclude
this solemn agreement
whereby peace may be restored.

01:13:52.361 --> 01:13:56.764
The issues have
been determined upon
the battlefields of the world...

01:13:56.799 --> 01:14:01.202
and hence are not
for our discussion or debate.

01:14:01.303 --> 01:14:04.932
The representative
of the emperor ofJapan,

01:14:05.040 --> 01:14:07.941
and of theJapanese Imperial
general headquarters,

01:14:08.010 --> 01:14:11.411
now sign
the instrument of surrender.

01:14:13.115 --> 01:14:17.142
General Sutherland,
will you show him
where to sign, please?

01:14:55.891 --> 01:14:59.054
The supreme commander
of the Allied powers...

01:14:59.094 --> 01:15:03.724
will now sign on behalf
of all the nations
at war with Japan.

01:15:13.642 --> 01:15:18.045
Will Generals Percival
and Wainwright
come forward, please?

01:15:29.525 --> 01:15:32.221
[Foghorn Blasts]

01:16:10.198 --> 01:16:14.396
The representative of
the United States of America
will now sign.

01:16:17.706 --> 01:16:21.107
The representative of
the Republic of China
will now sign.

01:16:21.143 --> 01:16:24.601
The representative of
the United Kingdom
will now sign.

01:16:24.646 --> 01:16:27.206
The representative of Canada
will now sign.

01:16:27.249 --> 01:16:29.410
The representative
of France...

01:16:29.451 --> 01:16:31.942
The representative of Australia
will now sign.

01:16:32.020 --> 01:16:34.318
The representative
of the Netherlands
will now sign.

01:16:34.356 --> 01:16:37.018
The representative
of New Zealand
will now sign.

01:16:37.125 --> 01:16:40.117
The representative
of the Union of Soviet
Socialist Republics...

01:16:40.162 --> 01:16:42.130
will now sign.

01:16:44.066 --> 01:16:46.830
Today...

01:16:46.868 --> 01:16:48.836
the guns are silent.

01:16:48.937 --> 01:16:51.838
A great tragedy
has ended.

01:16:51.873 --> 01:16:53.841
I speak...

01:16:53.875 --> 01:16:57.436
for the thousands of silent lips
forever stilled...

01:16:57.546 --> 01:16:59.446
among the jungles
and the beaches...

01:16:59.548 --> 01:17:01.812
and in the deep waters
of the Pacific...

01:17:01.883 --> 01:17:03.874
which marked the way.

01:17:03.919 --> 01:17:05.887
I pray...

01:17:05.921 --> 01:17:08.788
that an omnipotent
Providence...

01:17:08.890 --> 01:17:11.085
will summon
all persons of goodwill...

01:17:11.126 --> 01:17:15.290
to the realization
of the utter futility of war.

01:17:15.330 --> 01:17:20.393
We have known
the bitterness of defeat,

01:17:20.502 --> 01:17:24.700
the exultation of triumph,
and from both we have learned...

01:17:24.806 --> 01:17:27.536
that there can be
no turning back.

01:17:27.609 --> 01:17:31.306
We must go forward
to preserve in peace...

01:17:31.413 --> 01:17:33.506
what we won in war.

01:17:33.548 --> 01:17:37.314
The destructiveness
of the war potential...

01:17:37.352 --> 01:17:40.219
through progressive advances
in scientific discovery...

01:17:40.322 --> 01:17:43.155
has in fact
now reached a point...

01:17:43.225 --> 01:17:47.924
which revises
the traditional concept of war.

01:17:49.031 --> 01:17:50.965
War...

01:17:51.033 --> 01:17:54.434
the most
malignant scourge...

01:17:54.536 --> 01:17:57.027
and greatest sin
of mankind...

01:17:57.072 --> 01:18:02.305
can no longer be controlled,
only abolished.

01:18:05.981 --> 01:18:09.576
We are in a new era.

01:18:09.618 --> 01:18:11.882
If we do not devise...

01:18:11.920 --> 01:18:14.684
some greater
and more equitable means...

01:18:14.790 --> 01:18:17.816
of settling disputes
between nations...

01:18:18.794 --> 01:18:21.922
Armageddon will be
at our door.

01:18:24.900 --> 01:18:29.428
We have had
our last chance.

01:18:45.821 --> 01:18:49.120
[MacArthur] Court,
I want you to tell Washington
that I'm transferring food...

01:18:49.157 --> 01:18:51.352
and medical supplies
to theJapanese authorities.

01:18:51.426 --> 01:18:55.522
- Yes, sir.
- The next priority
is to get those men home,

01:18:55.630 --> 01:18:57.723
get them to work
rebuilding this country.

01:18:57.766 --> 01:18:59.734
I don't know.

01:18:59.768 --> 01:19:02.999
In terms of communication,
transport, industrial plant,
there isn't any country.

01:19:03.105 --> 01:19:05.665
Yeah, well, they'll have
to build a new one.

01:19:05.774 --> 01:19:08.971
A new Japan
with new ideas...

01:19:09.077 --> 01:19:12.103
but preserving
the best of the old.
Yes, sir.

01:19:12.180 --> 01:19:14.774
All of our troops
will be judged by me...

01:19:14.883 --> 01:19:17.408
for their conduct as men
and as soldiers.

01:19:17.486 --> 01:19:19.477
I want them to understand
that the Japanese...

01:19:19.588 --> 01:19:22.921
must be treated
with courtesy and respect.

01:19:23.992 --> 01:19:26.688
Alexander,
Caesar, Napoleon...

01:19:26.728 --> 01:19:29.390
all failed as occupiers
of conquered countries...

01:19:29.431 --> 01:19:32.025
because of the harshness
of their policies.

01:19:33.401 --> 01:19:35.335
I do not intend to fail.

01:19:35.437 --> 01:19:37.632
We're coming up
on the palace now.

01:19:39.307 --> 01:19:41.207
I wonder whether
it wouldn't be a good idea...

01:19:41.309 --> 01:19:43.300
to summon the emperor
to explain your policies.

01:19:43.411 --> 01:19:45.402
Show of authority
to the Japanese people.

01:19:45.514 --> 01:19:49.109
No. After a lifetime
of studying the Oriental mind,

01:19:49.217 --> 01:19:53.313
I can tell you that I must not
directly challenge...

01:19:53.421 --> 01:19:55.446
the authority
of the emperor.

01:19:55.524 --> 01:20:00.154
He lives there in that palace
across that moat, half god,
half king.

01:20:00.228 --> 01:20:03.527
His decrees limit the degree
of each man's freedom.

01:20:03.565 --> 01:20:05.726
His word is absolute.

01:20:07.135 --> 01:20:09.968
The time will come
when Hirohito,
of his own volition,

01:20:10.071 --> 01:20:12.471
will cross that moat
and come to me,

01:20:12.541 --> 01:20:14.532
and that will mark
the beginning of the end...

01:20:14.643 --> 01:20:17.043
of his absolute power
over the Japanese people.

01:20:17.345 --> 01:20:19.142
[Crowd Chattering]

01:20:40.068 --> 01:20:42.161
Good morning, sir.
Good morning, Court.

01:20:42.270 --> 01:20:45.364
Morning, gentlemen.
I've been going over
these additional suggestions...

01:20:45.473 --> 01:20:48.067
from the State Department
on the occupation.

01:20:48.176 --> 01:20:51.873
I have to work them in
with our own task force
recommendations.

01:20:51.913 --> 01:20:54.473
General Marquat,
what's happening
with land reform?

01:20:54.516 --> 01:20:57.280
The landowners
are having difficulty
with their tenant farmers.

01:20:57.319 --> 01:21:02.052
Oh, they are?
I don't want to ever hear
the word ''tenant farmer'' again.

01:21:02.123 --> 01:21:05.024
I want these
privileged landowners
stripped of their holdings.

01:21:05.126 --> 01:21:07.720
We'll break up
these great estates.
Yes, sir, but...

01:21:07.829 --> 01:21:10.457
They've been squeezing
the farmers dry
far too long.

01:21:11.933 --> 01:21:14.834
But, sir,
they're very strong.
[Chuckles]

01:21:14.936 --> 01:21:17.427
They may not be
as strong as they think.

01:21:17.539 --> 01:21:21.976
And the right-wing
industrialists are the fellows
who led this country to ruin.

01:21:22.043 --> 01:21:24.034
I want them expunged.

01:21:24.145 --> 01:21:26.841
''Expunged,''sir?
Don't you think that you...

01:21:26.948 --> 01:21:29.542
All in the best possible
legal language, of course.

01:21:29.584 --> 01:21:31.950
[All Chuckle]

01:21:32.053 --> 01:21:35.045
I want to see
a labor movement
take root.

01:21:35.156 --> 01:21:37.556
Labor movement?
That's right.

01:21:37.592 --> 01:21:41.358
The workers must have
a strong voice in
the means of production.

01:21:41.396 --> 01:21:45.992
General, pardon me,
but this reminds me
somewhat of...

01:21:46.067 --> 01:21:48.900
Well, it's like...
Like what?

01:21:49.004 --> 01:21:51.165
Like the New Deal.

01:21:52.974 --> 01:21:57.172
Ah. Well, this is Japan,
not America.

01:21:57.212 --> 01:21:59.476
But considering
her fascist past...

01:21:59.581 --> 01:22:03.244
it might be good to move her
just a little left of center,
don't you agree?

01:22:03.318 --> 01:22:05.650
Yes, sir.
Of course, we wouldn't
call it the New Deal.

01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:07.654
No, sir.
[Laughs]

01:22:07.722 --> 01:22:10.555
Now...

01:22:10.625 --> 01:22:12.650
Japanese women.
What about them?

01:22:12.727 --> 01:22:15.218
They must be given
the vote.
[Whistles]

01:22:15.330 --> 01:22:18.424
The men are not
gonna like that.
Neither did our men at first.

01:22:18.533 --> 01:22:22.731
General, I'm sorry,
but it's too much to expect
a feudal country likeJapan...

01:22:22.837 --> 01:22:25.362
to swallow
a whole new constitution
in one gulp.

01:22:25.473 --> 01:22:27.532
Their cabinet
will never go for it.

01:22:27.642 --> 01:22:32.045
The old cabinet wouldn't,
but we've yet to hear
from the new prime minister.

01:22:32.147 --> 01:22:35.639
[MacArthur] And may I
congratulate you on your
appointment, Mr. Shidehara.

01:22:35.750 --> 01:22:37.650
Thank you.

01:22:37.752 --> 01:22:39.982
General, I extend to you
my gratitude...

01:22:40.055 --> 01:22:44.583
for the penicillin
your medical services
made available to me.

01:22:44.659 --> 01:22:47.753
It aided me
in recovering from
a serious illness.

01:22:47.862 --> 01:22:49.955
Happy to be
of assistance.

01:22:51.800 --> 01:22:53.791
Diseases are conquered,
sir...

01:22:54.769 --> 01:22:59.263
even very old
epidemic diseases.

01:22:59.307 --> 01:23:01.798
Yes?
Sometimes, though...

01:23:01.910 --> 01:23:05.346
the cure is slow
and painful.

01:23:06.448 --> 01:23:08.416
Yes, of course.

01:23:09.751 --> 01:23:13.016
Is there some
particular difficulty?

01:23:19.527 --> 01:23:22.018
General,
our new constitution...

01:23:22.063 --> 01:23:27.524
must forbid any
military establishment
in Japan whatsoever.

01:23:27.569 --> 01:23:29.560
There must not
be an army...

01:23:29.671 --> 01:23:33.129
a navy or an air force.

01:23:33.241 --> 01:23:36.438
We must renounce now
and forever...

01:23:36.478 --> 01:23:40.972
the use of force
as an instrument
of national power.

01:23:48.256 --> 01:23:51.987
- Mr. Prime Minister,
I can only...
- Please. Hear me out.

01:23:52.060 --> 01:23:53.994
Of course.

01:23:54.062 --> 01:23:57.088
In this way...

01:23:57.165 --> 01:23:59.599
and only this way...

01:23:59.667 --> 01:24:03.603
can we eliminate forever...

01:24:03.705 --> 01:24:06.037
the power of
the militarists.

01:24:06.107 --> 01:24:08.132
Only in this way...

01:24:08.243 --> 01:24:12.543
can we reassure the world
that Japan...

01:24:12.614 --> 01:24:17.608
no longer has warlike design
against any people.

01:24:20.355 --> 01:24:22.823
We are a poor country...

01:24:22.924 --> 01:24:27.418
with 70 million person
to feed and clothe.

01:24:28.730 --> 01:24:30.823
We cannot afford armaments.

01:24:30.932 --> 01:24:35.631
We cannot afford
the trapping of power.

01:24:37.839 --> 01:24:40.831
And never, never again
can we suffer...

01:24:40.942 --> 01:24:42.876
Nagasaki and Hiroshima.

01:24:46.548 --> 01:24:48.675
Let us renounce war, sir.

01:24:49.751 --> 01:24:51.685
Please.

01:24:51.753 --> 01:24:56.281
Let us renounce war
in the new constitution...

01:24:56.357 --> 01:24:58.291
and forever.

01:25:00.595 --> 01:25:02.495
Mr. Shidehara...

01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:09.694
no man detests war...

01:25:09.804 --> 01:25:11.704
more than this soldier.

01:25:11.806 --> 01:25:15.105
My abhorrence for it
reached its height...

01:25:15.143 --> 01:25:18.010
with the development
of the atom bomb.

01:25:20.415 --> 01:25:23.509
No man, sir, could be
more moved by your offer...

01:25:24.953 --> 01:25:28.116
or more determined
to accept it.

01:25:28.223 --> 01:25:30.657
It's damned embarrassing.

01:25:30.725 --> 01:25:33.660
I've been telling Congress
for months we need
400,000 men in Japan.

01:25:33.728 --> 01:25:37.027
MacArthur holds
a press conference, says he can
make do with half that number.

01:25:37.132 --> 01:25:39.032
General, did he clear
this with you?
No, sir.

01:25:39.134 --> 01:25:41.932
There's been some
misunderstanding.
Not by me there isn't.

01:25:41.970 --> 01:25:45.428
I invited MacArthur to
come home. I wanted to discuss
occupation policy with him,

01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:49.533
and I expected him to
back up our position before
the congressional committees.

01:25:49.644 --> 01:25:51.737
So I held out
the big carrot to him.

01:25:51.846 --> 01:25:55.145
I told him we'd set up a series
of welcome-home demonstrations
and a joint session of congress.

01:25:55.250 --> 01:25:57.343
You know what he replied?

01:25:57.385 --> 01:25:59.979
He said he thought the situation
was just too dangerous there
for him to come home right now.

01:26:00.054 --> 01:26:03.717
He was just too busy. That's
what he said to the president of
the United States, damn it!

01:26:03.791 --> 01:26:05.782
[MacArthur Chuckling]

01:26:05.894 --> 01:26:08.522
General Derevyanko,
I must say...

01:26:08.596 --> 01:26:11.588
I've missed you.

01:26:11.699 --> 01:26:15.396
Only short visit to Moscow,
a meeting with my superiors,

01:26:15.503 --> 01:26:17.801
a holiday on Caspian Sea
with family.

01:26:17.906 --> 01:26:21.808
Good. I was afraid
that Stalin had
had you shot.

01:26:21.910 --> 01:26:24.401
No, no.
Why do you say that?

01:26:24.512 --> 01:26:26.912
Would Truman
have you shot?

01:26:26.948 --> 01:26:28.916
Sometimes I wonder.

01:26:31.319 --> 01:26:34.117
General, it's come
to my attention that several
hundreds of thousands...

01:26:34.155 --> 01:26:36.316
of Japanese prisoners
fell into your hands...

01:26:36.424 --> 01:26:39.120
in the closing days
of the war.

01:26:39.160 --> 01:26:41.151
You understand that
the Japanese authorities...

01:26:41.229 --> 01:26:46.724
and my own superiors as well
are pressing me for
an accounting.

01:26:46.768 --> 01:26:50.226
Ah, we have some small numbers
of enemy troops in our hands,
that is true.

01:26:50.338 --> 01:26:54.638
But I can assure
that in this matter,
as you know,

01:26:54.676 --> 01:26:58.271
my government will abide
by the decisions of
the Potsdam Conference.

01:26:58.346 --> 01:27:01.008
Yes. When will they
be repatriated?

01:27:01.082 --> 01:27:02.982
Soon.
[Chuckles]

01:27:03.017 --> 01:27:06.214
In that connection,
my government is making plans...

01:27:06.287 --> 01:27:09.313
for the occupation
of Hokkaido Island.

01:27:09.390 --> 01:27:14.123
Hokkaido Island is occupied.
It is under my command.

01:27:15.396 --> 01:27:17.921
The Soviet Union
is a coequal ally.

01:27:17.999 --> 01:27:20.297
It is my government's
intention...

01:27:20.335 --> 01:27:22.929
to occupy Hokkaido
on its own behalf.

01:27:25.039 --> 01:27:29.408
As the supreme commander,
I represent all Allied powers.

01:27:31.112 --> 01:27:34.809
We are fully prepared
to commence our
rightful occupation...

01:27:34.849 --> 01:27:37.215
whether you permit or not.

01:27:37.318 --> 01:27:40.412
You see, the terms of
my command are absolute.

01:27:41.456 --> 01:27:43.447
This is not Germany.

01:27:43.524 --> 01:27:48.621
I will not countenance
separate spheres of
influence or occupation...

01:27:48.730 --> 01:27:51.927
of the home islands of Japan
as long as I'm in command.

01:27:53.635 --> 01:27:56.627
Well, then, sir,
my government...

01:27:56.738 --> 01:27:59.036
will insist upon
a new supreme commander.

01:28:01.175 --> 01:28:03.769
If the day comes
when Soviet troops...

01:28:03.878 --> 01:28:08.372
attempt to land on
Japanese soil without
my expressed consent...

01:28:09.884 --> 01:28:13.684
I will throw the entire
Soviet delegation in Tokyo
into jail.

01:28:15.323 --> 01:28:17.382
Including you...

01:28:17.425 --> 01:28:19.393
General Derevyanko.

01:28:21.996 --> 01:28:23.930
I believe you would.

01:28:23.998 --> 01:28:27.331
And I believe
this is where you get off.

01:28:37.545 --> 01:28:42.005
[Man Narrating Newsreel]
As the historic changes continue
to transform Japanese life...

01:28:42.050 --> 01:28:44.814
it was becoming
evident this week
that the women of Japan...

01:28:44.852 --> 01:28:48.549
were winning their fight to end
family contract marriages,

01:28:48.623 --> 01:28:51.456
the right to equal
cigarette and sake rations,

01:28:51.526 --> 01:28:54.461
and the right to vote.

01:28:54.529 --> 01:28:58.522
Dress fashions
are not the only thing
that have changed radically.

01:28:58.566 --> 01:29:03.663
In the newly established
election, 13 million women
went to the polls,

01:29:03.771 --> 01:29:07.207
and in an unprecedented sweep,
elected 38 women lawmakers...

01:29:07.275 --> 01:29:10.574
to the house
of representatives.

01:29:10.611 --> 01:29:13.375

I regret to say something
terrible has happened.

01:29:13.481 --> 01:29:15.381
A prostitute,
Your Excellency,

01:29:15.483 --> 01:29:18.509
has been elected
to house of representative.

01:29:18.586 --> 01:29:23.580
- Prostitute?
- How many votes
did she receive?

01:29:23.624 --> 01:29:25.819
256,000.

01:29:29.697 --> 01:29:33.997
She must have
an unusually loyal clientele.

[Newsreel Narrator]
Now after two and a half years
of painstaking work...

01:29:37.205 --> 01:29:40.504
the war crimes trial in Tokyo
comes to an end.

As America prepares for another
presidential election year...

with the first anniversary
of its new constitution.

01:29:49.917 --> 01:29:52.511
Mmm... not these.

01:29:55.022 --> 01:29:58.514

I thought you might
like that one.

in Wisconsin?

- Polls closed an hour ago,
and I wish I had been there.

- I would have had one of
these on every lamppost.
- No, you don't, Vic.

No electioneering within
50 feet of the candidate.

01:30:18.780 --> 01:30:22.546
Why, General, you're not
a candidate. Just another
available citizen.

Excuse me, General,
but I'm from Wisconsin,

are voting for you.

surrounded in the Civil War.

is simple and apparent.

''The enemy is closing on me
from three sides,

is to fight like hell.''

MacArthur to Formosa
to do just the opposite?

01:34:59.994 --> 01:35:04.021
Call off Chiang and tell him
he couldn't send his troops into
mainland China or anywhere?

01:35:04.098 --> 01:35:06.692
We didn't send him
over there to forge
his own personal alliances.

01:35:06.801 --> 01:35:11.602
Hell, that sounds like
we're concluding some kind
of mutual defense treaty.

01:35:11.706 --> 01:35:14.800
Mr. Secretary,
I want you to radio a message
to His Majesty MacArthur.

01:35:16.110 --> 01:35:19.307
What's the matter with them
back there?

01:35:19.413 --> 01:35:22.314
Have they lost their nerve?
I know all about Chiang.

01:35:22.416 --> 01:35:24.407
If he had two horns
and a tail...

01:35:24.452 --> 01:35:28.115
we should use him
as long as he's anticommunist.

01:35:28.155 --> 01:35:30.248
We can reform him later.

01:35:32.860 --> 01:35:35.420
It's my destiny
to defeat Communism,

01:35:35.463 --> 01:35:39.729
and only God or those
Washington politicians
will keep me from doing it.

01:35:39.834 --> 01:35:41.961
[Truman]
You didn't read this one,
did you?

01:35:42.036 --> 01:35:44.766
It's a letter to
the Veterans of Foreign Wars.

01:35:44.872 --> 01:35:47.841
''Nothing could be
more fallacious than
the threadbare argument...

01:35:47.875 --> 01:35:51.743
''by those who advocate
appeasement and defeatism
in the Pacific...

01:35:51.779 --> 01:35:55.772
''that if we defend Formosa,
we alienate continental Asia.

01:35:55.850 --> 01:35:57.977
Signed, Douglas MacArthur.''

01:35:58.052 --> 01:36:00.145
You hear that?
Appeasement. Defeatism.

01:36:00.221 --> 01:36:02.689
That's me he's talking about.
Alvin, can you explain why
he's done this?

01:36:02.790 --> 01:36:05.520
No, Mr. President,
I'm afraid I can't.

01:36:05.593 --> 01:36:09.495
Did any of you know
in advance this letter
was gonna be printed?

01:36:09.530 --> 01:36:12.192
I want it withdrawn
right now.

01:36:31.018 --> 01:36:34.010
Good morning, General.
Whitney.

01:36:34.054 --> 01:36:36.545
I haven't seen that pipe
in a long time.

01:36:36.624 --> 01:36:40.116
In looking over your positions
this morning, General Walker,

01:36:40.161 --> 01:36:45.030
I saw that plans are afoot
to conduct retrograde movements
and abandon the perimeter.

01:36:45.065 --> 01:36:48.228
Effective immediately,
these plans will be scrapped.

01:36:48.269 --> 01:36:50.533
The present line
will be held.

01:36:50.638 --> 01:36:54.369
We don't have any perimeter,
General. Just a few
scattered strong points.

01:36:54.441 --> 01:36:57.137
As soon as I put out one fire,
another two get started.

01:36:57.244 --> 01:37:00.975
I know that you're
outnumbered in this thing,
but sending you more troops...

01:37:01.015 --> 01:37:03.779
so you can hang on to
this little corner of Korea...

01:37:03.818 --> 01:37:06.582
is not good enough.

01:37:06.687 --> 01:37:09.383
Well, I'll settle for
a regimental combat team.

01:37:09.423 --> 01:37:12.790
Can't do it, Walt.
We need every man we've got.

01:37:12.893 --> 01:37:14.793
General Shepherd...

01:37:14.895 --> 01:37:19.298
is putting together
an overwhelming amphibious
assault on Inchon.

01:37:19.333 --> 01:37:23.929
- Inchon?
- In one stroke, it'll cut
across the enemy's rear,

01:37:24.038 --> 01:37:27.906
sever his supply lines
and isolate all of his forces
south of Seoul.

01:37:28.008 --> 01:37:30.408
Without munitions, supplies,
communications,

01:37:30.444 --> 01:37:32.810
the North Koreans
will be paralyzed.

01:37:32.847 --> 01:37:35.441
Inchon is the worst...
Then you can break out
of that corner,

01:37:35.516 --> 01:37:38.314
move north
and overpower them.

01:37:38.419 --> 01:37:42.617
I think that Inchon
will finish the North Koreans.

01:37:44.425 --> 01:37:47.622
- What?
- It'll never be approved.

01:37:47.661 --> 01:37:50.630
[Man]
Inchon has some of
the highest tides in the world,

01:37:50.731 --> 01:37:53.222
but only once a month
do they reach a height...

01:37:53.334 --> 01:37:56.132
sufficient for our
largest landing craft to go in.

01:37:56.170 --> 01:37:58.536
There are maybe two
three-hour periods...

01:37:58.639 --> 01:38:00.800
when MacArthur
can put troops ashore.

01:38:00.908 --> 01:38:03.468
Which is not enough time
for a major amphibious landing.

01:38:03.577 --> 01:38:06.569
Exactly. This is little more
than a trench in the mudflats.

01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:11.083
If every possible
handicap were listed,
Inchon has them all.

01:38:11.185 --> 01:38:15.622
However, gentlemen, MacArthur
claims that these very handicaps
are what he's counting on.

01:38:15.689 --> 01:38:18.180
He feels that the enemy
won't believe that anyone...

01:38:18.292 --> 01:38:20.988
would try to surmount
such obstacles.

01:38:21.028 --> 01:38:24.987
The element of surprise
will be his most valuable ally.

01:38:26.600 --> 01:38:29.592
What do you think
of His Majesty's plan?

01:38:29.637 --> 01:38:32.800
It's daring, it's brilliant
and it's dangerous.

01:39:00.668 --> 01:39:03.364
Court, you remember
I once said,

01:39:03.470 --> 01:39:08.271
''The bullet has
not yet been cast
with my name on it''?

01:39:08.375 --> 01:39:10.275
I certainly do.

01:39:11.512 --> 01:39:14.504
Inchon could be
that bullet.

01:39:16.383 --> 01:39:19.682
There's 70,000 men
out there...

01:39:19.787 --> 01:39:21.687
waiting to hit Inchon.

01:39:23.791 --> 01:39:28.728
As of this moment,
the president has not personally
approved this mission.

01:39:28.796 --> 01:39:32.493
The last communication I had
from the Joint Chiefs...

01:39:32.599 --> 01:39:35.796
said that he'd
been ''informed.''

01:39:38.439 --> 01:39:40.532
He vacillated, delayed.

01:39:42.609 --> 01:39:46.807
Finally gave
begrudging permission...

01:39:46.847 --> 01:39:48.815
to proceed here.

01:39:55.322 --> 01:39:57.222
Powerful enemies, Court.

01:39:59.026 --> 01:40:03.258
Who advised Truman
that I was insubordinate
when I visited Chiang Kai-shek?

01:40:03.330 --> 01:40:05.662
Who persuaded him
to force me...

01:40:05.733 --> 01:40:09.362
to withdraw my letters to
the Veterans of Foreign Wars?

01:40:09.470 --> 01:40:13.668
Who are those
who seek to humiliate me
and undermine my authority?

01:40:15.642 --> 01:40:19.738
The Communists
and their fellow travelers
in the British Foreign Office.

01:40:22.549 --> 01:40:27.145
If Inchon fails,
they will have a jubilee.

01:40:27.254 --> 01:40:31.657
The Joint Chiefs of Staff
approved this invasion because
your arguments were valid.

01:40:31.692 --> 01:40:33.785
Yes, they were valid.

01:40:33.861 --> 01:40:36.796
But if the enemy is ready
with a superior force...

01:40:38.699 --> 01:40:41.190
we will not be able
to disengage...

01:40:41.268 --> 01:40:43.463
without suffering
enormous losses.

01:40:48.976 --> 01:40:53.072
We could lose
this entire fleet.

01:40:53.113 --> 01:40:59.018
This date could be marked
as one of the greatest military
tragedies in American history.

01:40:59.086 --> 01:41:02.249
General,
I don't think for one...
Are you surprised, Court?

01:41:03.624 --> 01:41:06.559
I'm sharing my doubts with you
after all these years.

01:41:07.961 --> 01:41:11.124
[Sardonic Chuckle]
Did you think
I was invulnerable?

01:41:13.233 --> 01:41:18.068
- It just came in.
We've got Wolmi-do Island.
- What?

01:41:18.172 --> 01:41:21.232
- Wolmi-do is ours.
- It took my boys 58 minutes.

01:41:21.341 --> 01:41:24.276
Ho ho! Ha ha!

01:41:26.847 --> 01:41:30.044
Good work, General Shepherd.
Good work.

01:41:31.652 --> 01:41:34.348
I'll be the first
to admit it.

01:41:34.455 --> 01:41:37.549
He did a hell of a job,
and here's to him.
Hear, hear.

01:41:41.061 --> 01:41:43.859
What's the matter, Alvin?
Don't you like
the taste of victory?

01:41:43.964 --> 01:41:45.955
Bourbon's not bad, either.
[Chuckles]

01:41:45.999 --> 01:41:48.365
Yes, Inchon is
a masterstroke.
Damn right it is.

01:41:48.402 --> 01:41:50.495
Now that's what
I call ''generaling.''

01:41:50.604 --> 01:41:53.698
I've heard that the
North Koreans have turned tail
and are running for home.

01:41:53.807 --> 01:41:55.866
It's not the North Koreans
I'm worried about.

01:41:55.976 --> 01:41:58.274
Mr. Panika,
the Indian ambassador to Peking,

01:41:58.312 --> 01:42:00.644
informs us that
any American troops
above the 38th parallel...

01:42:00.714 --> 01:42:03.308
will provoke an intervention
by the Chinese.

01:42:03.417 --> 01:42:07.319
Yesterday we monitored
this very same warning
over Radio Peking.

01:42:07.421 --> 01:42:11.016
We've heard that
sort of thing before.
How serious are they?

01:42:11.125 --> 01:42:13.025
Frankly, we don't know.

01:42:13.127 --> 01:42:15.425
What's MacArthur
say about it?
He's not worried.

01:42:15.462 --> 01:42:18.124
He's calling it
political blackmail.
He's probably right.

01:42:18.165 --> 01:42:23.068
Mr. President, let's watch
our step. If we expand the war
in Korea to include Red China,

01:42:23.170 --> 01:42:26.037
we're up against
the Soviets,
A-bomb and all.

01:42:32.246 --> 01:42:37.843
Alvin. You go on
ahead to Wake Island.
Make the usual preparations.

01:42:37.951 --> 01:42:41.443
I think it's time
I had a talk with
General MacArthur.

01:42:41.488 --> 01:42:44.480
I've never met the man.
Yes, sir.

01:42:50.397 --> 01:42:52.695
Wake Island,
Mr. President.

01:42:52.766 --> 01:42:55.758
[Truman]
By golly, that was quick.

01:42:55.869 --> 01:42:58.463
How about one of you fellas
radio on ahead?

01:42:58.572 --> 01:43:01.006
See if
the big general's there.

01:43:01.108 --> 01:43:04.339
The president should be greeted.
He shouldn't be the greeter.

01:43:11.852 --> 01:43:15.413
I don't see him,
Mr. President.

01:43:15.455 --> 01:43:19.357
They probably had
a little trouble getting
him down off his cross.

01:43:46.253 --> 01:43:50.383
[No Audible Dialogue]

01:43:50.457 --> 01:43:54.860
Wait a minute. There he is.
That son of a bitch isn't
in uniform, he's in costume.

01:43:54.962 --> 01:43:58.591
I don't know why it is
an old man like that,
and a five-star general to boot,

01:43:58.665 --> 01:44:02.192
has to run around dressed up
like a 19-year-old
second lieutenant.

01:44:02.302 --> 01:44:05.738
[Laughing]
I'll tell you one thing, if he
was an officer in my outfit...

01:44:05.806 --> 01:44:09.105
I'd bust him so fast
he wouldn't know what happened.

01:44:09.142 --> 01:44:11.110
And making me wait.

01:44:11.144 --> 01:44:14.602
He can do that to Harry Truman,
but not to his
commander in chief.

01:44:31.331 --> 01:44:33.561
General, I've been
a long time meeting you.

01:44:33.634 --> 01:44:36.125
I hope it won't be
so long next time.
So do I.

01:44:36.169 --> 01:44:38.137
General Bradley.
MacArthur.

01:44:38.238 --> 01:44:40.729
Bess sent along a plum cake
for the missus.

01:44:40.841 --> 01:44:43.366
How very thoughtful.
Thank you, sir.

01:44:43.477 --> 01:44:45.968
And how are Mrs. Truman
and your daughter?

01:44:46.079 --> 01:44:48.172
They're fine.
Just fine, thank you.

01:44:58.558 --> 01:45:01.186
General,
I've read a little...

01:45:03.096 --> 01:45:07.123
military history, and it's
a pleasure to congratulate you
on your success at Inchon.

01:45:07.200 --> 01:45:09.498
That was the work
of a master strategist.

01:45:09.536 --> 01:45:13.939
Thank you, Mr. President.
Coming from you,
that's a real tribute.

01:45:14.007 --> 01:45:18.410
And I'd like to apologize
for any misunderstanding
raised by my trip to Formosa.

01:45:18.445 --> 01:45:21.812
Don't think any more about that.
I understand your feelings.

01:45:21.848 --> 01:45:25.614
I was a captain in
Battery D in World War I,

01:45:25.652 --> 01:45:28.621
and that was the center
of the war effort for me.

01:45:28.655 --> 01:45:32.022
Perhaps you should have
stayed in the army.

01:45:32.059 --> 01:45:35.051
[Laughs]
Nope, I don't think so.

01:45:35.128 --> 01:45:38.962
I've heard it's
a bad idea for army men
to dabble in politics.

01:45:39.032 --> 01:45:43.435
Mr. President, you know
that I'm not involved
in politics in any way.

01:45:43.470 --> 01:45:48.339
I did let the politicians
make a chump out of me
in the '48 elections.

01:45:48.442 --> 01:45:51.240
If a general is going
to be running against you,

01:45:51.345 --> 01:45:54.473
his name will be Eisenhower,
not MacArthur.

01:45:54.548 --> 01:45:56.482
Eisenhower?

01:45:56.550 --> 01:46:00.042
That man doesn't know
as much about politics
as a pig does about Sunday.

01:46:00.153 --> 01:46:01.916
[Chuckles]

01:46:05.892 --> 01:46:08.690
Uh, General...

01:46:08.795 --> 01:46:11.696
I came over here
to listen to your ideas...

01:46:11.798 --> 01:46:14.790
on the rehabilitation
of postwar Korea.

01:46:16.903 --> 01:46:18.996
Mind if I smoke,
Mr. President?

01:46:19.106 --> 01:46:23.406
No, I suppose I've had
more smoke blown in my face
than any man alive.

01:46:29.249 --> 01:46:32.309
The formal resistance,
I believe...

01:46:34.521 --> 01:46:39.220
should end in Korea
by Thanksgiving.

01:46:39.259 --> 01:46:42.751
And now that we've authorized
military operations
above the parallel,

01:46:42.829 --> 01:46:46.424
do you include North Korea
in that estimate?
Yes, I do.

01:46:46.466 --> 01:46:50.630
By the time I'm finished,
we should have the entire
peninsula under control.

01:46:50.737 --> 01:46:53.365
General, you do
understand the limitations
on your directive...

01:46:53.473 --> 01:46:55.839
from the Joint Chiefs
of Staff?

01:46:55.876 --> 01:47:00.279
No military operations
beyond the Chinese
and Soviet borders...

01:47:00.380 --> 01:47:03.577
and no American troops
near those borders.

01:47:03.617 --> 01:47:06.711
Yes, I believe I understand
that directive fully...

01:47:06.787 --> 01:47:09.984
and our boys should
be home by Christmas,
Mr. President,

01:47:10.090 --> 01:47:14.083
provided that Red China
stays out of the conflict.

01:47:15.495 --> 01:47:17.520
Well, I'm glad
to hear that, General.

01:47:17.597 --> 01:47:20.498
I've got the whole
United Nations on my back.

01:47:20.534 --> 01:47:23.002
A couple dozen members
have got troops under you
in Korea,

01:47:23.103 --> 01:47:27.597
and the bunch of them
are scared stiff that we're
pushing them into World War III.

01:47:27.707 --> 01:47:30.198
There's no doubt
that Stalin's pact
with Mao Tse-tung...

01:47:30.310 --> 01:47:34.804
pledges that the Soviet A-bomb
backs the Chinese if we should
tangle with them.

01:47:34.848 --> 01:47:38.045
You mentioned
Chinese intervention.
Is there any chance of that?

01:47:38.118 --> 01:47:41.315
Mr. President,
you must have...

01:47:41.354 --> 01:47:44.915
more complete intelligence
on that matter than I have.

01:47:45.025 --> 01:47:48.552
- Anything that I would say
would be purely speculative.
- Of course.

01:47:48.628 --> 01:47:51.062
I'm sure that you
also realize that...

01:47:51.131 --> 01:47:53.156
any question
involving China...

01:47:53.233 --> 01:47:57.260
requires a political evaluation,
not simply a military one.

01:47:57.370 --> 01:48:00.999
Our intelligence
on the Chinese is limited.

01:48:01.107 --> 01:48:05.976
They're believed to have
about 300,000 men in Manchuria,

01:48:06.012 --> 01:48:10.176
but I doubt they could get
more than 50,000 across
the Yalu River.

01:48:10.217 --> 01:48:13.482
They'd be highly vulnerable
to our air attacks.

01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:18.719
So in my opinion, the chances
of Red intervention...

01:48:18.792 --> 01:48:20.726
are minimal.

01:48:20.794 --> 01:48:23.228
And if they were to try
to get down to the parallel,

01:48:23.296 --> 01:48:25.730
they'd be walking into disaster,
a crushing defeat.

01:48:25.799 --> 01:48:28.324
[Crowd Cheering]

01:48:37.410 --> 01:48:41.744
Well, I've, uh...
I've never had a more
satisfactory conference...

01:48:41.815 --> 01:48:43.840
since I've been president.

01:48:43.917 --> 01:48:46.715
General MacArthur is
a member of the government
of the United States,

01:48:46.753 --> 01:48:49.722
and he's loyal
to that government
and to the United Nations,

01:48:49.756 --> 01:48:51.951
and he's loyal to the president
and his foreign policy,

01:48:52.025 --> 01:48:55.119
and he's confident
that the fighting
in Korea will soon be over.

01:48:55.228 --> 01:48:57.628
[Applause]

01:49:03.970 --> 01:49:07.201
[Man]
Hey! What the hell is this?

01:49:07.307 --> 01:49:09.775
Turkey!
Real turkey!

01:49:09.876 --> 01:49:12.470
What'd you expect,
shithead?
It's Thanksgiving.

01:49:14.414 --> 01:49:16.882
Best thing about Thanksgiving
is eating white meat!

01:49:16.983 --> 01:49:19.281
[Laughter]

01:49:19.319 --> 01:49:21.685
I tell you,
if I had my way...

[Man Shouting In Korean]

01:49:55.422 --> 01:49:59.620
General Bradley called me
at 6: 15 this morning with a
message from General MacArthur.

01:50:01.127 --> 01:50:05.427
He says there are
260,000 Chinese out there
against him.

01:50:05.465 --> 01:50:08.332
He says he's stymied.

01:50:08.435 --> 01:50:10.630
Says he has to go over
on the defensive.

01:50:10.737 --> 01:50:14.229
It isn't a matter of
a few volunteers. The Chinese
have jumped in with both feet.

01:50:16.176 --> 01:50:20.135
Well, what are they saying
about me in Washington?

01:50:20.246 --> 01:50:23.545
Sir, to be candid about it,
they think you walked into
a Chinese trap.

01:50:24.751 --> 01:50:27.151
That was a deliberate
misunderstanding.

01:50:27.253 --> 01:50:30.279
The defeat of the North Koreans
was decisive.

01:50:30.357 --> 01:50:33.349
In the face of this victory,
the Chinese Communists...

01:50:33.393 --> 01:50:38.160
have committed the most
offensive act of international
lawlessness in history!

01:50:38.264 --> 01:50:42.291
We are now facing
a new, fresh,

01:50:42.369 --> 01:50:44.667
highly trained army!

01:50:44.771 --> 01:50:50.300
What does Truman mean
by calling this
a ''police action''?

01:50:50.410 --> 01:50:54.972
Isn't it a fact
that the casualties
are mounting daily?

01:50:55.015 --> 01:50:57.279
This ''police action''...

01:50:57.317 --> 01:51:00.809
has almost destroyed
the Korean nation.

01:51:00.920 --> 01:51:02.751
For what?

01:51:04.824 --> 01:51:08.123
I've seen as much blood
and disaster as any man
now living.

01:51:08.228 --> 01:51:10.526
Every time
I come out of here...

01:51:11.631 --> 01:51:15.931
I could just...
just be sick!

01:51:16.036 --> 01:51:18.231
It curdles my stomach.

01:51:18.338 --> 01:51:21.330
Does he intend
to let this go on?

01:51:21.441 --> 01:51:23.341
By what sophistry
of reason?

01:51:23.443 --> 01:51:25.570
Sir, he has the Russians
to consider...

01:51:25.645 --> 01:51:27.579
and our allies.

01:51:27.647 --> 01:51:29.945
General Bradley
feels the same way.

01:51:30.050 --> 01:51:32.951
He says that a war
with China would
be the wrong war...

01:51:33.053 --> 01:51:37.285
at the wrong time
in the wrong place
and with the wrong enemy.

The Joint Chiefs of Staff.

01:51:40.794 --> 01:51:45.458
I requested permission
to bomb the Chinese airfields
in Manchuria.

01:51:45.498 --> 01:51:47.466
The request was denied.

01:51:47.500 --> 01:51:50.901
I requested permission
for hot pursuit
of enemy aircraft...

01:51:51.004 --> 01:51:53.199
into their privileged sanctuary
above the Yalu.

01:51:53.306 --> 01:51:55.274
That request was denied.

01:51:55.375 --> 01:51:59.869
I requested permission to bomb
the Yalu bridges to keep
the Chinese out of Korea.

01:51:59.979 --> 01:52:01.742
They said,

01:52:01.815 --> 01:52:04.045
you might bomb...

01:52:04.117 --> 01:52:07.143
the southern half
of the bridges only.

01:52:07.220 --> 01:52:11.350
In my 50 years
of military service...

01:52:11.424 --> 01:52:16.123
I have never learned
how to bomb half a bridge!

01:52:20.166 --> 01:52:24.034
It's the most imbecilic order
ever given to a commander
in the field.

01:52:28.742 --> 01:52:31.472
This...

01:52:31.544 --> 01:52:33.569
is appeasement.

01:52:33.680 --> 01:52:36.843
Unless some positive
and immediate action
can be taken,

01:52:36.950 --> 01:52:39.976
we should withdraw
our forces to Japan.

01:52:40.053 --> 01:52:42.283
Forgive me, sir,
but...

01:52:42.355 --> 01:52:44.346
there are some
of those back home
who believe...

01:52:44.457 --> 01:52:48.291
that it's possible
to regain the offensive
without...

01:52:48.361 --> 01:52:50.591
well, without danger
of widening the war.

01:52:50.663 --> 01:52:54.155
Without widening the war?

01:52:57.704 --> 01:53:02.698
Well, the 8th Army
is Ridgway's now.
He can do what he likes.

01:53:02.809 --> 01:53:04.936
It won't do any good.

01:53:05.011 --> 01:53:08.811
For the first time
in military history...

01:53:08.915 --> 01:53:14.012
a commander has been denied
the use of his military power...

01:53:14.053 --> 01:53:19.116
to safeguard the lives
of his soldiers
and the safety of his army.

01:53:19.159 --> 01:53:24.961
It leaves me with a sense
of inexpressible... shock.

01:53:29.169 --> 01:53:32.730
Well, hallelujah.

I wish I could celebrate...

01:53:40.180 --> 01:53:42.375
but the war
hasn't been won.

01:53:42.448 --> 01:53:45.440

roll up and down,
up and down.

01:53:46.553 --> 01:53:48.453
Victory nowhere in sight.

01:53:50.056 --> 01:53:52.490
This isn't war.
It's half war.

01:53:54.093 --> 01:53:57.256
It's an immoral compromise
with evil.

01:53:59.666 --> 01:54:02.499
There's more than dust
settling in Korea, Sid.

01:54:04.003 --> 01:54:05.994
It's American blood.

01:54:06.105 --> 01:54:08.699
Yes, sir.

01:54:08.808 --> 01:54:13.040
Oh, the head of the
United Kingdom mission wants
an appointment with you, sir.

01:54:13.112 --> 01:54:15.205
What does he want?

01:54:15.315 --> 01:54:18.409
He's worried
that we're getting
desperate in Korea,

01:54:18.451 --> 01:54:20.919
and we'll use
the bomb.
Huh!

01:54:20.954 --> 01:54:24.412
Probably more worried about
protecting British profits
in Hong Kong...

01:54:24.457 --> 01:54:28.757
than in saving lives
in Korea.
I'll shift his

01:54:28.828 --> 01:54:31.661
Excuse me, General.
We just got word that
Washington wants you...

01:54:31.731 --> 01:54:34.165
to stop all offensive
operations immediately.

01:54:38.171 --> 01:54:40.139
What?

01:54:40.173 --> 01:54:45.076
They want to affect a political
rather than a military solution.

01:54:45.144 --> 01:54:49.046
They're planning to draft
a cease-fire proposal.

01:54:49.082 --> 01:54:51.983
They ask for any recommendations
you may have for
minor adjustments...

01:54:52.051 --> 01:54:54.952
along your battle lines
to consolidate your position
for adequate defense.

01:54:54.988 --> 01:54:58.446
''Minor adjustments''?
What are they
talking about?

01:54:58.491 --> 01:55:01.983
Why should
I recommend anything?
This is total capitulation!

01:55:02.095 --> 01:55:05.587
Well, sir, in view of
Truman's feeling, you want to
substitute your policy for his.

01:55:05.632 --> 01:55:08.533
[MacArthur]
I couldn't substitute
my policy for Mr. Truman's,

01:55:08.601 --> 01:55:12.731
because Mr. Truman
doesn't have a policy!

01:55:12.839 --> 01:55:16.935
Fine, sir. Why don't you let me
notify them that you're taking
the proposals under study...

01:55:17.043 --> 01:55:20.809
No.
I have a better idea.

01:55:20.847 --> 01:55:23.509
We'll send a message
to the Chinese commander.

01:55:23.549 --> 01:55:26.950
Put it on all the wire services.
I want maximum exposure.

01:55:27.020 --> 01:55:30.421
Sir, you have been
specifically prohibited
from issuing any statements.

01:55:30.456 --> 01:55:33.016
Sir, that is a direct order
from the president.

01:55:36.629 --> 01:55:39.860
And that is part
of a dangerous concept...

01:55:39.933 --> 01:55:43.926
that men of the armed forces
owe their primary allegiance...

01:55:44.037 --> 01:55:47.529
to these temporary occupants
of the White House,

01:55:47.640 --> 01:55:51.940
instead of to the country
and the Constitution
we're sworn to defend!

01:55:54.781 --> 01:55:57.443
[Truman] I ought to
kick his insubordinate ass
right in the Sea of Japan.

01:55:57.550 --> 01:56:01.816
The lousiest trick he's pulled.
I travel 14,000 miles to reach
an understanding face-to-face,

01:56:01.888 --> 01:56:04.982
and he still thinks he can do
what he damn well pleases.
[Alvin] Can you imagine?

01:56:05.091 --> 01:56:09.790
He actually sent a message
to the Chinese threatening
to destroy their forces...

01:56:09.829 --> 01:56:12.696
unless they were to
negotiate a solution
with him personally.

01:56:12.799 --> 01:56:15.495
You know,
there's a story...

01:56:15.601 --> 01:56:18.593
where Abe Lincoln was
trying to mount a horse
that was skittish,

01:56:18.638 --> 01:56:21.698
and the horse
kicked a hind hoof
into the stirrup.

01:56:21.808 --> 01:56:24.436
So Lincoln says to him,
''If you're gonna get on,
I'll get off.''

01:56:24.544 --> 01:56:26.512
Well, I'm not
getting off.

01:56:26.612 --> 01:56:29.513
I think Roosevelt
should have pulled Wainwright
out of Corregidor...

01:56:29.615 --> 01:56:32.413
and left that
five-star brass hat MacArthur
there to be the martyr.

01:56:32.518 --> 01:56:35.146
What shall I do with
the cease-fire proposal?

01:56:35.221 --> 01:56:39.021
Scrap it. I can't
approach the Chinese on any
political basis, not after this.

01:56:39.125 --> 01:56:42.322
That man's trying
to start World War III,
and I'm trying to prevent it.

01:56:42.428 --> 01:56:46.421
I'm gonna fire that brass hat
prima donna right now.
Who does he think he is? God?

01:56:46.532 --> 01:56:49.524
What do you think
Congress would do if
I relieve the big general?

01:56:49.569 --> 01:56:51.662
Congress would
flay you alive.

01:56:51.771 --> 01:56:55.434
Fortunately for me,
the Navy outfielder's throw
was also wild,

01:56:55.541 --> 01:56:59.238
over the third baseman's head,
and with those two wild throws,

01:56:59.278 --> 01:57:02.179
I was able to dash around
the bases into home...

01:57:02.215 --> 01:57:05.082
with what turned out to be
the winning run.

01:57:05.118 --> 01:57:09.179

And...
And the final score was...

were led by my mother.

West Point on the same day.

Meanwhile,
in our nation's capital,

01:59:24.023 --> 01:59:27.186
the statement from
the Joint Chiefs of Staff
said in part, quote:

01:59:27.293 --> 01:59:30.228
''It is fundamental
that all military commanders...

01:59:30.296 --> 01:59:33.788
''must be governed by our laws
and the constitutional
guarantee...

01:59:33.833 --> 01:59:36.393
of civilian control
over the military.''

01:59:36.502 --> 01:59:38.629
When asked to comment,
President Truman said:

01:59:38.738 --> 01:59:42.697
People who think they're God
are bound to get into trouble
sooner or later.

01:59:42.742 --> 01:59:46.610
You have to understand that
the people of this country are
men and women of common sense,

01:59:46.712 --> 01:59:52.150
and whenever anybody gets too
far out of line, the people are
gonna put him out of business.

[Applause]

01:59:55.555 --> 02:00:00.754

But once war
has been forced upon us...

02:00:00.826 --> 02:00:04.023
there is no other
alternative...

02:00:04.130 --> 02:00:07.122
than to apply
every available means...

02:00:07.233 --> 02:00:09.463
to bring it to a swift end.

02:00:11.571 --> 02:00:15.530
War's very object
is victory,

02:00:15.641 --> 02:00:18.132
not prolonged indecision.

02:00:19.645 --> 02:00:21.636
In war...

02:00:21.747 --> 02:00:26.684
there can be no substitute
for victory.

02:00:30.590 --> 02:00:35.050
For history teaches us,
with unmistakable emphasis...

02:00:35.161 --> 02:00:40.656
that appeasement but begets
new and bloodier war.

02:00:40.700 --> 02:00:45.467
Like blackmail,
it lays the basis for new...

02:00:45.571 --> 02:00:48.005
and increasingly
greater demands...

02:00:48.074 --> 02:00:50.770
until, as in blackmail...

02:00:50.876 --> 02:00:54.812
violence becomes
the only alternative.

02:01:02.121 --> 02:01:04.715
''Why...''

02:01:04.757 --> 02:01:10.127
''Why,'' my soldiers
asked of me,

02:01:10.162 --> 02:01:16.067
''surrender military advantages
to an enemy in the field?''

02:01:19.872 --> 02:01:21.840
I could not answer.

02:01:24.377 --> 02:01:27.744
The magnificence
of the courage...

02:01:27.780 --> 02:01:30.840
and fortitude
of the Korean people...

02:01:32.852 --> 02:01:34.786
defies description.

02:01:37.156 --> 02:01:41.354
They have chosen
to risk death...

02:01:41.460 --> 02:01:43.758
rather than slavery.

02:01:46.065 --> 02:01:48.556
Their last words
to me were...

02:01:51.103 --> 02:01:55.563
''Don't scuttle
the Pacific.''

02:02:06.419 --> 02:02:11.118
I am closing my 52 years
of military service.

02:02:14.126 --> 02:02:17.755
When I joined the army,
even before the turn
of the century...

02:02:19.465 --> 02:02:24.528
it was the fulfillment
of all my boyish hopes
and dreams.

02:02:26.672 --> 02:02:28.731
The world
has turned over many times...

02:02:28.841 --> 02:02:32.538
since I took the oath
on the plain at West Point...

02:02:34.046 --> 02:02:37.948
and the hopes and dreams
have long since vanished.

02:02:40.686 --> 02:02:42.654
But I still remember
the refrain...

02:02:42.688 --> 02:02:47.591
of one of the most popular
barrack ballads of that day...

02:02:48.661 --> 02:02:51.755
which proclaimed
most proudly that...

02:02:52.865 --> 02:02:57.268
''Old soldiers never die...

02:02:59.004 --> 02:03:02.940
they just... fade away.''

02:03:05.911 --> 02:03:08.607
Like the old soldier
of that ballad...

02:03:10.549 --> 02:03:13.347
I now close
my military career...

02:03:15.721 --> 02:03:19.817
and just... fade away...

02:03:19.859 --> 02:03:22.020
an old soldier...

02:03:23.062 --> 02:03:26.031
who tried to do his duty...

02:03:26.065 --> 02:03:28.033
as God...

02:03:29.068 --> 02:03:32.936
gave him the light
to see that duty.

02:03:42.648 --> 02:03:44.582
Good-bye.

02:03:46.952 --> 02:03:49.284
[Whistles,
Shouts Of Approval]

02:03:59.165 --> 02:04:02.498
Good-bye, hell.
He's running for president.
[Clicks Off]

02:04:02.601 --> 02:04:05.695
[Male Convention Speaker]
I give you
the greatest war hero...

02:04:05.805 --> 02:04:09.832
America has ever known,
our finest leader of men,

02:04:09.942 --> 02:04:12.410
our most
brilliant strategist,

02:04:12.445 --> 02:04:15.107
a man of inspiration
and a man of action...

02:04:15.147 --> 02:04:19.709
I give you the next president
of the United States,

02:04:19.819 --> 02:04:23.016
five-star General
of the Army...

02:04:23.122 --> 02:04:26.523
Dwight David Eisenhower!

02:04:26.625 --> 02:04:28.616
[Crowd Cheering]

02:04:40.039 --> 02:04:42.564
What kind of president
do you think he's gonna make?

02:04:47.179 --> 02:04:50.273
I think he'll make
a fine president.

02:04:50.349 --> 02:04:53.580
He was the best clerk
who ever served under me.

02:05:03.496 --> 02:05:06.192
[MacArthur's Voice]
The shadows
are lengthening for me.

02:05:07.733 --> 02:05:09.701
Twilight is here.

02:05:11.604 --> 02:05:17.304
My days of old have vanished
tone and tint,

02:05:17.409 --> 02:05:21.311
they have gone glimmering
through the dreams of things
that were.

02:05:23.616 --> 02:05:26.813
Their memory is one...

02:05:26.919 --> 02:05:29.319
of wondrous beauty...

02:05:29.355 --> 02:05:32.415
watered by tears
and coaxed and caressed...

02:05:32.458 --> 02:05:35.518
by the smiles
of yesterday.

02:05:35.628 --> 02:05:38.859
I listen vainly
but with thirsty ear...

02:05:38.931 --> 02:05:41.331
for the witching melody...

02:05:41.433 --> 02:05:45.164
of faint bugles
blowing reveille,

02:05:45.271 --> 02:05:48.434
of far drums
beating the long roll.

02:05:49.742 --> 02:05:52.677
In my dreams,
I hear the crash of guns,

02:05:52.778 --> 02:05:55.941
the rattle of musketry,

02:05:55.981 --> 02:05:59.439
the strange
mournful mutter...

02:05:59.552 --> 02:06:01.486
of the battlefield.

02:06:05.391 --> 02:06:08.417
But in the evening
of my memory...

02:06:09.495 --> 02:06:11.486
always I return...

02:06:13.799 --> 02:06:15.790
to West Point.

02:06:17.403 --> 02:06:20.600
Always there echoes
and re-echoes...

02:06:21.707 --> 02:06:24.107
duty...

02:06:24.143 --> 02:06:26.805
honor...

02:06:26.912 --> 02:06:28.812
country.

02:06:34.253 --> 02:06:36.346
Today...

02:06:36.422 --> 02:06:40.916
marks my final roll call
with you.

02:06:43.062 --> 02:06:47.055
But I want you to know
that when I cross the river...

02:06:47.132 --> 02:06:50.932
my last
conscious thoughts...

02:06:53.238 --> 02:06:57.140
will be of the Corps...

02:06:59.645 --> 02:07:01.476
and the Corps...

02:07:03.582 --> 02:07:05.482
and the Corps.

02:07:12.024 --> 02:07:13.992
I bid you...

02:07:15.894 --> 02:07:17.828
farewell.
