May ljoin you?

19:40.440 --> 19:42.090
Actually,
I'm waiting for a friend.

19:42.280 --> 19:44.282
Then let me
keep you company
while you wait.

19:44.440 --> 19:45.601
Please.

19:49.120 --> 19:50.485
Terrible what happened
to you.

19:50.640 --> 19:51.687
Just bad luck.

19:51.760 --> 19:53.046
I don’t think
you believe that.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.089

drank himself to death

19:55.160 --> 19:57.811

20:03.680 --> 20:05.284
You think anyone
born in my situation

20:05.360 --> 20:06.805
could have done the same?

20:07.840 --> 20:10.161
There is
no such thing as luck.

20:10.320 --> 20:12.322
Just like you being here.

you are here.

20:32.880 --> 20:35.406
And what is it
you want from me?

20:35.680 --> 20:38.206
All I ever wanted
was to be a dancer.

20:39.280 --> 20:42.090
Ever since I was
a small child...

20:42.600 --> 20:45.729
when I would take the bus
to rehearsal after school...

20:46.360 --> 20:47.850
and I would look out
of the windows

20:47.920 --> 20:49.445
at the people
going about their lives...

20:50.640 --> 20:53.120
going to work,
half-asleep...

20:53.280 --> 20:55.521

tell myself...

26:37.760 --> 26:39.603
Ustinov dismissed
his security,

26:39.680 --> 26:42.251
so I saw an opportunity,
and I took it.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.729
Why would he do that?

What you said in that bar
was exactly right...

57:31.240 --> 57:34.562
Registered as a translator
for the Embassy.

57:34.760 --> 57:38.890
But her real name
is Dominika Egorova.

57:39.280 --> 57:42.090
She used to dance
with the Bolshoi.

57:42.240 --> 57:44.811
There's officially no record
of her being SVR...

57:44.960 --> 57:46.962
but that's bullshit.
She's here for Marble.
I know it.

57:47.120 --> 57:49.361
Stay away from her.
I think she's valuable.

she's recruitable?

sticks his head out again...

57:58.680 --> 58:00.762
so we can get him
back into play.
That's the priority.

58:00.920 --> 58:03.287
She's Ivan Egorov's niece.

58:12.800 --> 58:14.211

on the Internet.

58:14.360 --> 58:16.044
Why would she use
her real name?

58:16.200 --> 58:17.486
Because
she's an innocent.

58:17.680 --> 58:20.047
Or because
ifs a provocation.

58:20.200 --> 58:22.009
Both of which are
very good reasons
to stay away from her.

Mmm-hmm?

58:35.280 --> 58:38.250

let you fuck her,
she's definitely SVR...

because she’s
way out of your league.

And in exchange,

my mother would get
the doctor she needed.

Instead, they cut his throat,
and he died on top of me.

you want from me?

01:22:17.320 --> 01:22:18.924
Whatever you can give us.

01:22:19.120 --> 01:22:21.043

Be your SPY?

01:22:25.200 --> 01:22:28.488
ls that any different
from being his?

01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:31.484
Yeah, because I would never
ask you to do what he did.

01:22:31.640 --> 01:22:33.369
Nothing's worth that.

01:22:35.160 --> 01:22:36.844
I need to sleep.

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:38.650
Why don't you
take my room?

01:22:46.720 --> 01:22:49.690
You know, you asked me
why I fired the gun
in Moscow?

01:22:49.840 --> 01:22:53.640
Well, the man

01:22:53.800 --> 01:22:56.041
He was benefiting
from the system.“

01:22:56.240 --> 01:22:58.846
but when he saw what was
happening in his name...

01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:01.128
he didn't just say
that he didn't know.

01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:03.647
He risked his life.
He risked everything.

01:23:03.800 --> 01:23:06.007
He didn't deserve to die
in a cellar somewhere.

01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:07.764
If you do this...

01:23:07.960 --> 01:23:10.486
I'll do everything
in my power
to protect you.

01:23:44.160 --> 01:23:45.764

Hey.

01:25:08.040 --> 01:25:09.166
Thank you.

01:25:14.520 --> 01:25:17.171
I danced
my first solo to this.

01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:19.930
It's Grieg.

01:25:20.920 --> 01:25:25.369
I was so nervous
the night before,
I couldn't sleep.

01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:29.126
And I played this music
in my room...

01:25:30.240 --> 01:25:33.449
and, after I fell asleep,
I dreamed that...

01:25:33.600 --> 01:25:37.650
the music was color,
and I could paint...

01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:42.488
over all the audiences'
faces with my hands.

01:25:54.640 --> 01:25:57.086
I'm sorry about
what happened to you.

01:26:00.880 --> 01:26:03.770
But I'm really very glad
that you're here.

01:26:03.920 --> 01:26:05.081
Me too.

Are you sure about this?

01:26:08.520 --> 01:26:10.682
Okay. Well, listen.

Did you eat breakfast
this morning?

01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:10.241
Yes.

01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:11.606
Are you an officer

01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:13.330
of the Russian
Intelligence Service?

01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:14.561
Yes.

01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:16.400
TRISH:
Are you here because

01:27:16.480 --> 01:27:18.721
CIA Officer Nate Nash
recruited you?

01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:19.967
Yes.

01:27:22.000 --> 01:27:24.287
TRISH: Are you willing
to work for the
American government?

01:27:24.440 --> 01:27:25.487
Yes.

01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.890
TRISH: And you intend to
give us genuine information?

01:27:29.320 --> 01:27:30.401
Yes or no?

01:27:30.480 --> 01:27:31.481
Yes.

01:27:31.600 --> 01:27:32.601
TRISH: Why would you
do that?

01:27:32.680 --> 01:27:34.284
I thought itwas
just yes or no?

01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:36.727
I'm just curious.

01:27:36.880 --> 01:27:38.882
I know the nature
of the men I work for.

01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:40.201
So why work for them?

01:27:40.400 --> 01:27:42.402
They gave me no choice.
I have a question.

01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:44.927
You only spike
when Nate's name comes up.

01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:47.242
Did you engage in
sexual intercourse
with him?

01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:48.401
Hey, that's...
Take it easy.

01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:49.481
Because that's
what you do, right?

01:27:49.560 --> 01:27:50.561
NATE: Marty? Marty.

01:27:50.640 --> 01:27:51.641
MARTY: That's what
you're trained for.

01:27:51.720 --> 01:27:52.721
Anybody ever
tell you that...

01:27:52.800 --> 01:27:54.325
Why do you need
to know, bratok?

01:27:55.080 --> 01:27:56.081
Big brother?

01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:58.210
Please answer the question.

01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:00.124
We'd need to know if
you're emotionally involved.

01:28:00.280 --> 01:28:01.361
The answer is no.

01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:06.844
So, are you satisfied?

01:28:07.560 --> 01:28:09.210
Yeah.
If I am to work for you...

01:28:09.360 --> 01:28:12.443
I will need money transferred
to a bank account in Vienna.

01:28:13.640 --> 01:28:15.802
$30,000 to start.

01:28:17.320 --> 01:28:19.004
TRISH: I don't know
what you and Nate discussed...

01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:20.571
but I think we’re getting
a little ahead of ourselves.

01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:22.563
We'd have to see
what you brought us.

01:28:22.640 --> 01:28:24.085
if it's significant...

01:28:24.240 --> 01:28:26.049
What about a senator's
chief of staff?

01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:27.531
Excuse me?

01:28:27.680 --> 01:28:30.001
A chief of staff
run by the SVR?

01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:32.248
She's agreed
to sell information

01:28:32.320 --> 01:28:33.845
on a satellite
defense system.

01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:36.241
I'm to fly to London
on Friday
to meet with her.

01:28:38.760 --> 01:28:41.206
Shall I provide you
with the account
information?

01:28:59.280 --> 01:29:00.486

01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:16.885
It's to the left.

01:29:22.800 --> 01:29:24.006
We'll get it.
We're good.

What are you doing here?

01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:39.089
Thought you might
need some help

01:29:39.160 --> 01:29:41.322
after what happened
to poor Marta.

01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:45.443
Of course, you were lucky
not to be harmed yourself.

01:29:45.600 --> 01:29:47.921
I appreciate your concern.

01:29:48.080 --> 01:29:49.206
Though I do wonder how
Swan would react

01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:50.526
if she saw me with you.

01:29:50.680 --> 01:29:52.011
Do you really
want to be the one

01:29:52.080 --> 01:29:53.525
to blow
this whole operation?

01:29:53.680 --> 01:29:56.729
Director Egorov would be
very displeased.

01:29:57.400 --> 01:30:01.291
Go upstairs, room 624.
I'll call you
if I need you.

01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:03.121
Go.

01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:21.601
TRISH: Who the hell is that?
NATE: He's got a key.

01:30:21.760 --> 01:30:23.330
Did she say anybody else
was gonna be in that room?

01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:26.922
No. I think that's...
Yeah, it's Volontov.

01:30:27.800 --> 01:30:28.847
That's her boss.

01:30:36.600 --> 01:30:37.601
Vodka.

01:30:56.440 --> 01:30:57.441
Do I know you?

01:30:57.520 --> 01:30:59.090
We have a friend
in common.

01:31:00.840 --> 01:31:01.887
Where is she?

01:31:02.040 --> 01:31:04.884
Unfortunately, Marta
wasn't able to make it.

01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:06.291
So she sent me.

01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:09.640
Oh.

01:31:09.880 --> 01:31:11.291
I'll just be leaving.

01:31:25.600 --> 01:31:27.762
You really think
I care if people know

01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:29.205
who I'm meeting with?

01:31:29.800 --> 01:31:31.370
I think in this case,
you might.

01:31:31.520 --> 01:31:34.285
Marta's a known
intelligence officer.

01:31:34.440 --> 01:31:35.521
If photographs
of your relationship

01:31:35.600 --> 01:31:36.601
were to go public...

01:31:36.800 --> 01:31:39.485
you would lose your security
clearance, and your job.

01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:41.682
But I don't think
that any of that is necessary.

01:31:41.840 --> 01:31:43.604
You're here for business,
as am I.

01:31:43.760 --> 01:31:47.401
$250,000 was the figure
that you agreed upon.

01:31:47.600 --> 01:31:50.649
Your daughter's tuition
payments are coming up.

01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:53.007
I believe your ex-husband
is about to lose another job.

01:31:56.280 --> 01:31:57.441
Don't you think
you would be

01:31:57.520 --> 01:31:59.249
more comfortable
in a private room?

01:32:00.080 --> 01:32:01.684
Where do they find you?

01:32:02.040 --> 01:32:03.121

01:32:28.680 --> 01:32:30.523
I just want to be clear.

01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:34.082
I'm here in a strictly
exploratory manner.

01:32:34.240 --> 01:32:36.129
As long as what you have
to offer is of value...

01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:38.049
I'm sure we will have
no difficulty.

01:32:38.240 --> 01:32:42.370

want to waste any time.

anything to sell?

that I'm not doing this...

a real pour, huh, Boris?
