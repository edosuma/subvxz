[door opens]

00:03.492 --> 00:06.426
Damn! My advertisers
are gonna freak.

00:06.492 --> 00:09.526
I sold all this space based
on having "TLC" on the cover

00:09.592 --> 00:13.792
but now "TLC" has to go to LA
to shoot a PSA for the NBA.

00:13.859 --> 00:17.792
‐ Now, I'm PO'ed.
‐ Join the club.

00:17.859 --> 00:20.392
I tried to get tickets
for "Naughty by Nature" today

00:20.459 --> 00:24.826
all they had was row, Triple Z.
And I do not like nose bleeds.

00:24.892 --> 00:26.359
"Naughty by Nature" is in town?

00:26.426 --> 00:28.292
‐ 'Yeah.'
‐ I'll get them for the cover.

00:28.359 --> 00:29.526
I know Vinnie.

00:29.592 --> 00:32.125
You're tight
with "Naughty by Nature"?

00:32.192 --> 00:34.426
Prove it. Get me
a date with Treach.

00:36.826 --> 00:38.392
Nah. She's tight with him.

00:38.459 --> 00:41.192
Her and Vinnie used to torture
me when we were kids.

00:41.259 --> 00:43.859
Alright, let it go, Regine.

00:43.926 --> 00:46.726
He made me eat flies,
Khadijah. Flies!

00:48.526 --> 00:51.026
Khadijah, you think you can
get me front row seats?

00:51.092 --> 00:52.659
I mean, money is no object.

00:52.726 --> 00:54.859
I'll pay 40 percent
of the face value.

00:54.926 --> 00:56.926
‐ Consider it done.
‐ Thank you.

00:56.992 --> 00:59.459
Me and Vinnie are like fam,
I'm tellin' you.

00:59.526 --> 01:03.166
But he's a big celebrity
and you're a big...nobody.

01:03.232 --> 01:05.199
[Kyle smirks]

01:05.266 --> 01:07.266
Please, I can call
him anytime.

01:07.332 --> 01:08.732
Hm‐hm.

01:08.799 --> 01:10.566
Got his home number memorized.

01:10.632 --> 01:11.932
Uh‐huh.

01:15.399 --> 01:18.266
Hi, Vinnie?
Wassup, it's Dijah.

01:18.332 --> 01:19.866
Yeah.

01:19.932 --> 01:22.866
Oh. A photo shoot, huh?

01:22.932 --> 01:24.866
Well, I'll call you back later.

01:24.932 --> 01:27.132
Alright, peace.
Ha ha.

01:27.199 --> 01:29.432
‐ That's my boy. Ha ha.

Oh, the chick
was a total villain.

How she manipulated
her husband into committing

02:31.772 --> 02:33.972
terrible acts of evil.

02:34.039 --> 02:36.872

I had no idea that
you could act like that.

You're a natural.

02:54.739 --> 02:56.172
‐ Really?
‐ Yeah.

02:56.239 --> 02:58.472
Now, there's this play
I wrote that's being produced

02:58.539 --> 03:00.812
at the Park Slope Playhouse.

03:00.879 --> 03:02.346
And we open in a week

03:02.412 --> 03:04.779
and there's one part
I still haven't cast.

03:04.846 --> 03:06.746
I want you to be in it.

03:06.812 --> 03:09.246
Me? I don't know
what to say.

03:09.312 --> 03:12.812
Say you'll read it. And if
you like the part, you'll do it.

03:12.879 --> 03:15.479
Okay. Which character
would I play?

03:15.546 --> 03:20.279
Oh, it's major. You'd be,
woman with shopping bag.

03:22.746 --> 03:24.279
Wow!

03:25.812 --> 03:27.212
Exactly.

03:29.479 --> 03:32.212
Guess what? I just got offered
a part in a play.

03:32.279 --> 03:33.612
‐ Alright.
‐ Oh.

03:33.679 --> 03:35.879
That's great, sweet pea.
Congratulations.

03:35.946 --> 03:37.912

really paid off, huh?

03:37.979 --> 03:39.146
Big time.

03:39.212 --> 03:41.946
Being on stage has always
been a secret dream of mine.

03:42.012 --> 03:43.746
I wouldn't say
takin' acting classes

03:43.812 --> 03:46.412
and updating your headshot
every six months is a secret.

03:48.479 --> 03:51.379
So, what part do you play,
my little mahogany?

03:51.446 --> 03:53.746
Woman with shopping bag.

03:53.812 --> 03:55.646
Sounds good, eh?

03:55.712 --> 03:58.446
Nah, I don't know. Depends on
where she went shoppin'.

Well, let's have
a little look, shall we?

04:03.419 --> 04:06.119
Yada yada yada, my part.

04:06.186 --> 04:09.986
Yada yada, my part,
my part, my part.

04:10.052 --> 04:12.452
My part, whoa!
This is a good play.

04:14.452 --> 04:16.452
You know, it's gonna take
a lotta rehearsal.

04:16.519 --> 04:18.652
It could eke into
our snuggle time.

04:18.719 --> 04:20.619
You don't have
to use our relationship

04:20.685 --> 04:22.952
as an excuse
not to pursue your dream.

04:23.019 --> 04:25.252
I find plenty of time
to practice the oboe

04:25.319 --> 04:26.819
it doesn't interfere.

04:28.186 --> 04:30.886
I didn't know
you play the oboe, Obie.

04:30.952 --> 04:32.885
I didn't know you
had headshots.

04:38.352 --> 04:40.619
No, I told you,
I'm a friend of Vinnie's.

04:42.252 --> 04:43.986
No, I already spoke
to the agent

04:44.052 --> 04:45.652
who transferred me
to their publicist

04:45.719 --> 04:47.686
who transferred me
to their personal assistant

04:47.752 --> 04:50.419
who transferred me to you.
Who are you?

04:54.019 --> 04:56.419
No, I'm very happy
with my long distance carrier.

04:59.552 --> 05:01.292
‐ Hey.
‐ Oh, good, Regine, you're home.

05:01.359 --> 05:04.259
Need your help with this acting
exercise called The Mirror.

05:04.326 --> 05:07.826
The Mirror?
Hmm, sounds intriguing.

05:07.892 --> 05:11.159
Yes, all we have to do
is look each other in the eyes

05:11.226 --> 05:13.159
and mirror each other's
every move.

05:21.192 --> 05:23.126
Wha‐what are you doing?

05:24.726 --> 05:26.959
Well, in my mirror,
you need a touch up.

05:33.992 --> 05:37.959
Hey, hi, ma.

05:38.026 --> 05:39.392
Oh, nothing.

05:39.459 --> 05:43.292
I just wanted to call you
and tell you I love you.

05:43.359 --> 05:44.926
Okay, here's a favor.

05:44.992 --> 05:47.726
Look, I need you to run over
to Vinnie's mother's house

05:47.792 --> 05:49.892
and get his number for me.

05:49.959 --> 05:52.459
She's not talking to you?

05:52.526 --> 05:54.492
Well, ma, there
is a pooper‐scooper law.

05:54.559 --> 05:58.059
You shouldn't have let Smokey
do that on her lawn.

05:58.126 --> 06:00.066
She said what about Smokey?

06:02.732 --> 06:04.699
You didn't track down
Naughty yet?

06:04.766 --> 06:06.366
[chuckles]

06:06.432 --> 06:08.299
Look. I'm a journalist, Max.

06:08.366 --> 06:10.132
Would you let me
work my sources?

06:10.199 --> 06:11.299
[whispers]
I'm sorry.

06:11.366 --> 06:13.299
Okay, ma, thanks anyway.

06:15.032 --> 06:17.766
‐ Oh, eggplant.
‐ Back off, it's mine.

06:19.599 --> 06:22.099
I don't wanna eat it.
I wanna say it.

06:22.166 --> 06:25.332
Oh, well, that makes sense.

06:25.399 --> 06:26.832
It's an acting technique.

06:26.899 --> 06:29.132
If you remove all language
except for one word

06:29.199 --> 06:32.899
it forces you to use that
one word to express all emotion.

06:34.499 --> 06:36.099
Eggplant.

06:37.732 --> 06:39.532
Eggplant.

06:40.732 --> 06:41.999
Eggplant!

06:44.966 --> 06:46.666
Eggplant.

06:48.999 --> 06:52.166
You know, somehow I don't think
Denzel's walking around

06:52.232 --> 06:54.166
his house going..

06:55.499 --> 06:57.099
Eggplant.

06:59.232 --> 07:01.139
So, what is this play about?

07:01.206 --> 07:03.439
It's about the choices
that we have to make

07:03.506 --> 07:06.606
between material goods
and spiritual fulfillment.

07:06.672 --> 07:09.406
Nah, I read it and thought
it was about eight people

07:09.472 --> 07:12.939
standing in line at the ATM.

07:13.006 --> 07:14.406
It's about that too.

07:14.472 --> 07:17.372
And Aaron is thinking
about expanding my part.

07:17.439 --> 07:19.906
So that you're woman
with two shopping bags.

07:19.972 --> 07:21.206
[laughing]

07:24.039 --> 07:26.872
Hey, now, I finally found
something I'm good at.

07:26.939 --> 07:30.306
Remember, many a successful
actor had humble beginnings.

07:30.372 --> 07:32.639
Michelle Pfeiffer
was a checkout girl.

07:32.706 --> 07:35.406
Brad Pitt worked
in a chicken suit.

07:35.472 --> 07:38.672
I worked for Khadijah,
I'm gonna be big.

07:38.739 --> 07:40.906
[laughing]

07:40.972 --> 07:42.872
Eggplant.

07:45.606 --> 07:48.006
The ATM just ate my card.

07:49.139 --> 07:51.906
And I have exceeded
my withdrawal limit.

07:53.739 --> 07:56.172
I can receive no more.

07:58.172 --> 08:00.546
Then you may only give.

08:03.879 --> 08:05.046
[clapping]

08:07.612 --> 08:09.646
Powerful stuff, people.

08:09.712 --> 08:10.979
Oh.

08:11.046 --> 08:12.779
Okay, notes.

08:12.846 --> 08:16.446
Uh, lady in heels, project.

08:17.646 --> 08:20.846
Fat man with camera

08:20.912 --> 08:22.579
you need to focus.

08:22.646 --> 08:25.812
That was a truly
moving performance

08:25.879 --> 08:27.246
and I should know.

08:27.312 --> 08:30.463
I studied acting across
the street from Juilliard.

08:30.530 --> 08:32.363
Oh.

08:32.429 --> 08:34.363
Okay. Everybody, gather around.

08:36.530 --> 08:39.863
Now, last night,
I was reading this final scene

08:39.929 --> 08:42.297
and I got really bummed out.

08:42.363 --> 08:45.197
You know, I felt like
the climax just didn't.

08:46.530 --> 08:48.463
Then I got inspired.

08:49.997 --> 08:52.497
It is so exciting
when your muse strikes.

08:52.563 --> 08:54.497
Mine always pops up
when I loofah.

08:55.963 --> 08:58.297
Aaron, the scene, yeah

08:58.363 --> 09:00.870
it takes the play
to a whole new level.

09:00.937 --> 09:04.370
From heels, to clogs,
to sandals.

09:04.437 --> 09:06.270
It's every woman's story.

09:07.870 --> 09:10.470
Aaron, um, this Xerox
is a little fuzzy.

09:10.537 --> 09:12.803
What's that word?
Rude, crude?

09:12.870 --> 09:15.570
Oh, no, that's nude.

09:15.637 --> 09:18.803
‐ I come into the scene nude?
‐ Yeah.

09:18.870 --> 09:22.270
Okay. Everybody,
let's take it from the top.

09:30.533 --> 09:32.000
[door opens]

09:37.562 --> 09:39.529
I come home
from a long day's work

09:39.595 --> 09:41.829
and find you two kickin'
it in my apartment

09:41.895 --> 09:44.529
what's wrong with this picture?

09:44.595 --> 09:47.295
Kyle's here.

09:47.362 --> 09:50.129
I'm here waitin' for Khadijah
to come home with my tickets.

09:50.195 --> 09:52.695
I'm waitin' for Khadijah
to come home with my weekend.

09:52.762 --> 09:54.195
Treach.

10:00.895 --> 10:04.502
There I am trying to jump on
the hood of Vinnie's car, right

10:04.569 --> 10:06.902
as it comes out
of the private garage.

10:06.969 --> 10:09.469
Then out of nowhere,
these two bodyguards

10:09.535 --> 10:12.835
grab me and throw me
into the fruit stand.

10:12.902 --> 10:14.835
I got kiwi all over my butt.

10:16.302 --> 10:19.469
Oh, so basically
what I'm hearing

10:19.535 --> 10:21.469
is there are no tickets.

10:23.135 --> 10:24.435
Come on, Khadijah

10:24.502 --> 10:26.735
you can call one of your
other celebrity friends.

10:26.802 --> 10:28.769
I hear Shaun Cassidy is in town.

10:30.635 --> 10:32.135
Okay.

10:32.202 --> 10:33.169
Hmm.

10:33.235 --> 10:35.869
You win.
I guess you're right.

10:35.935 --> 10:38.702
I guess me and Vinnie
weren't as tight as I thought.

10:38.769 --> 10:41.469
I don't know why you tryin'
to track him down.

10:41.535 --> 10:45.069
Little rat used to wear mirrors
on his shoes in the playground.

10:47.169 --> 10:49.469
Looking up under my dress.

10:54.235 --> 10:55.635
[sighs]

11:03.009 --> 11:04.242
[sighs]

11:06.775 --> 11:08.709
Alright, this time
try it happy.

11:10.375 --> 11:12.509
Wassup, Synclaire?

11:12.575 --> 11:14.609
Aaron reconceptualized
the play.

11:16.142 --> 11:20.042
He made a very interesting
costume change.

11:20.109 --> 11:23.842
Oh, well, if you don't like
the wardrobe just accessorize.

11:23.909 --> 11:26.475
Some pearls and a purse
makes a world of difference.

11:28.142 --> 11:31.442
I'd need a whole lot of pearls
and a mighty big purse.

11:33.442 --> 11:35.509
So, what does
he want you to wear?

11:35.575 --> 11:37.475
Nothing.

11:37.542 --> 11:39.475
You, you gonna be naked?

11:43.509 --> 11:47.975
Synclaire, I'm asking
you this because I love you.

11:48.042 --> 11:50.009
You're not gonna be
dancing in a cage

11:50.075 --> 11:52.409
or nothin' like that, are you?

11:52.475 --> 11:54.275
Of course not.

11:54.342 --> 11:58.442
My character represents purity
in this technocratic society.

11:58.509 --> 12:00.415
Her nudity is essential
to the play.

12:00.482 --> 12:01.982
So what's the big deal?

12:02.049 --> 12:05.749
My character looks
a lot like me in the nude.

12:05.815 --> 12:08.415
Oh, please.
It's no big deal.

12:08.482 --> 12:11.649
I've gone to a lotta nude
beaches, this is no different.

12:11.715 --> 12:14.282
Yeah, but you don't have
50 people starin' at you

12:14.349 --> 12:15.915
with their mouths wide open.

12:15.982 --> 12:18.049
Speak for yourself.

12:19.549 --> 12:21.515
I don't know what to do?

12:21.582 --> 12:24.449
This is gonna be
a hard one for you, Khadijah.

12:24.515 --> 12:27.282
Uh‐ah, no, it's not.
This is your decision.

12:27.349 --> 12:29.849
Yeah, what's running
through my mind is

12:29.915 --> 12:31.982
what did Overton have to say?

12:32.049 --> 12:34.882
I haven't seen him yet.
I'm sure he'll understand.

12:34.949 --> 12:36.382
Hell, no!

12:38.382 --> 12:40.382
I don't want your
special gifts on display

12:40.449 --> 12:42.815
for every Tom, Dick or Rahim.

12:45.749 --> 12:47.115
I know.

12:47.182 --> 12:50.382
One of the messages of the play
is that clothing is artificial.

12:50.449 --> 12:52.382
Not if you wear all cotton.

12:54.015 --> 12:55.449
I'm so confused.

12:55.515 --> 12:58.515
If I wanna be an actor
and the part calls for nudity

12:58.582 --> 13:00.049
who am I to say no?

13:00.115 --> 13:02.755
Overton's girlfriend.

13:02.822 --> 13:05.255
Obie, I'm not totally
comfortable with it either

13:05.322 --> 13:07.055
but isn't this part
of the commitment

13:07.122 --> 13:08.622
I've made to my craft?

13:08.689 --> 13:10.155
Oh, hey, I'm a craftsman too

13:10.222 --> 13:13.489
but you don't see me usin'
my ratchet in the raw, do you?

13:15.589 --> 13:18.789
Alright, Obie, if you
really don't want me to do it.

13:18.855 --> 13:21.355
Oh, no. Oh, no.

13:21.422 --> 13:23.722
I'm man of the 90s,
I'm much too savvy

13:23.789 --> 13:25.289
to fall into that trap.

13:25.355 --> 13:28.855
Gee, if I say no, you'll resent
me for the rest of your life.

13:28.922 --> 13:32.422
If I say yep, then you catch
a cold and it's still my fault.

13:34.089 --> 13:37.455
Oh, no, girly,
this decision is yours.

13:37.522 --> 13:39.755
You're not gonna help
me with this, are you?

13:39.822 --> 13:41.555
Oh, sure I will.

13:41.622 --> 13:43.989
I'll be behind you
no matter what you do.

13:44.055 --> 13:46.589
Now, if you'll excuse me

13:46.655 --> 13:49.989
I'm gonna go down to my workshop
and make a sign that says

13:50.055 --> 13:51.955
"Upon entering the theater

13:52.022 --> 13:55.189
please leave all photographic
equipment with the handyman."

13:58.655 --> 14:00.595
Aaron, how do I put this?

14:01.695 --> 14:03.429
There's no way
on God's green Earth

14:03.495 --> 14:05.562
I'm gonna show
my tatas on stage.

14:06.695 --> 14:08.629
Now, let me explain
what I've done

14:08.695 --> 14:10.462
with the ballet sequence.

14:10.529 --> 14:15.129
You will pirouette, arabesque,
and leap, landing here.

14:16.329 --> 14:18.662
‐ So, we're loosing the split.
‐ Hm‐hm.

14:18.729 --> 14:22.395
[chuckles]
Aaron, you're a genius.

14:22.462 --> 14:24.962
Synclaire, you're not supposed
to be here for another hour.

14:25.029 --> 14:26.762
Well, I‐I want to talk to you.

14:26.829 --> 14:30.595
Oh, you guys have got
to be my most dedicated actors.

14:30.662 --> 14:32.929
You know, that's the kinda
commitment that separates

14:32.995 --> 14:36.895
the wannabes from
the gonnabes. You two rule.

14:37.962 --> 14:39.562
Fat man, why don't
you stretch

14:39.629 --> 14:41.062
while I talk to Synclaire?

14:41.129 --> 14:44.195
So, uh, what's up?

14:45.395 --> 14:46.595
Aaron.

14:46.662 --> 14:49.162
You, I believe you are
an extraordinary director

14:49.229 --> 14:50.762
and I respect your work deeply.

14:50.829 --> 14:51.962
Ditto.

14:52.029 --> 14:54.629
You know, that's why
I gave you the pivotal moment.

14:54.695 --> 14:57.395
Because I know
you can carry it.

14:57.462 --> 14:59.429
Oh, gee, it's
not so much me

14:59.495 --> 15:01.835
as a gift that
comes through me.

15:01.902 --> 15:04.235
Man, I can't wait
for tomorrow night.

15:04.302 --> 15:06.502
You know, we are gonna
show that audience

15:06.569 --> 15:08.502
something they rarely see.

15:10.202 --> 15:12.269
Maybe not. Ha ha ha.

15:12.335 --> 15:15.235
What I'm trying to say,
Aaron, is that I fee‐‐

15:15.302 --> 15:18.302
You know what? Wait till you see
these really cool posters.

15:19.202 --> 15:21.535
Check it out.

15:21.602 --> 15:24.402
'"ATM. No Funds Available.'

15:24.469 --> 15:27.335
Featuring, Synclaire James."

15:28.602 --> 15:31.935
Why, I've never been
featured before.

15:32.002 --> 15:34.035
My name is so big.

15:35.469 --> 15:37.702
What time do you
want me here tomorrow night?

15:37.769 --> 15:39.369
‐ 6:30, sharp.
‐ I'm there.

15:39.435 --> 15:41.935
Aaron, question.

15:42.002 --> 15:44.102
Who's going to lift me?

15:47.902 --> 15:49.902
Alright, Regine,
curtain goes up at 8 o'clock

15:49.969 --> 15:51.602
let's get a move on.

15:51.669 --> 15:52.802
[knocking]

16:06.909 --> 16:08.442
Vinnie!

16:08.509 --> 16:11.409
Well, you can hey‐ho
your ass right out the building.

16:14.809 --> 16:17.475
Khadijah, that
was "Naughty by Nature."

16:17.542 --> 16:19.075
Treach!

16:22.409 --> 16:25.109
Hi, Naughty. I am too.
Won't you come in please.

16:27.709 --> 16:30.942
Khadijah, how you just
go and slam the door on my face.

16:31.009 --> 16:33.275
I knew he wasn't
still tight with her.

16:33.342 --> 16:37.275
Braggin' about knowin' some
big magazine publisher. Yeah.

16:37.342 --> 16:39.609
So, so, Treach.

16:39.675 --> 16:41.809
What are your plans
for the evening?

16:41.875 --> 16:44.575
Hmm. Nothin' much,
just a little..

16:52.809 --> 16:54.642
Ooh, it's, uh

16:54.709 --> 16:56.642
too freaky for me,
excuse me.

17:00.982 --> 17:02.249
Oh, come on, Khadijah.

17:02.315 --> 17:05.582
I came as soon as I figured out
what happened at the hotel.

17:05.648 --> 17:08.382
It was that silly clerk,
told me it was some groupie

17:08.449 --> 17:10.315
stalkin' me,
named Cathedral Jones.

17:12.015 --> 17:13.315
Cathedral Jones?

17:13.382 --> 17:17.315
Isn't that the girl who did
those scrap movies in the 70s?

17:17.382 --> 17:20.714
Look, first of all, your mother
owes my dog an apology.

17:20.781 --> 17:22.982
Alright, cool.
It's‐it's done, It's done.

17:23.049 --> 17:25.415
Secondly, the reason I'm going
through all of this..

17:25.482 --> 17:27.982
I really need an interview
and some photos for "Flavor."

17:28.049 --> 17:30.215
Alright, we'll handle that too.
Anything for you.

17:30.282 --> 17:31.749
Cathedral.

17:35.115 --> 17:36.649
Hey, Nay‐Nay.

17:40.315 --> 17:42.249
Get him out of my house.

17:43.449 --> 17:46.082
We sure got a big
Vin Fan Club in here.

17:47.349 --> 17:49.082
Vinnie, I got
one question for you.

17:49.149 --> 17:50.315
Hm‐mm?

17:50.382 --> 17:53.915
Why did you
make me eat flies?

17:53.982 --> 17:57.649
Listen, listen, I was just
a kid and it was the only way

17:57.715 --> 18:01.222
I could think of to let
you know that I liked you.

18:01.289 --> 18:02.522
Yeah, well..

18:02.589 --> 18:04.355
You must've really
liked Wanda Richardson

18:04.422 --> 18:06.355
you made her eat
a caterpillar.

18:08.122 --> 18:10.922
Check it out, babe, you see,
he's the smoothest player

18:10.989 --> 18:12.789
out of the three of us here.

18:15.455 --> 18:16.489
So, so, so, so.

18:16.555 --> 18:17.622
[chuckles]

18:17.689 --> 18:18.855
Listen, um..

18:18.922 --> 18:21.655
Would you guys like
to go to a play with us?

18:21.722 --> 18:23.189
Khadijah's cousin
is starring in it.

18:23.255 --> 18:25.622
Hmm, thanks, but we really
don't have the time.

18:25.689 --> 18:27.455
‐ She's going to be naked.
‐ Whoa!

18:27.522 --> 18:30.622
‐ We can carve out an hour.
‐ Two.

18:30.689 --> 18:33.789
Alright, alright.
Hey‐ho. Ha ha.

18:37.089 --> 18:40.389
There, your face is done.

18:40.455 --> 18:42.589
And these are the only
cheeks I'm doin'.

18:47.589 --> 18:49.822
Aww, there's
my little theater moss.

18:49.889 --> 18:52.189
Oh, Obie, I wasn't
sure you'd come.

18:52.255 --> 18:54.889
Oh, I wasn't sure either,
but I figured since you

18:54.955 --> 18:57.455
gonna be topless, you might
need a little extra support.

18:58.789 --> 19:00.762
Thank you.
They're beautiful.

19:00.829 --> 19:04.029
Yep. You can either put 'em
in a vase or wear them.

19:05.762 --> 19:07.395
Pretty much your choice.

19:07.462 --> 19:09.595
Synclaire, this is nothing
like a nude beach

19:09.662 --> 19:11.762
even I couldn't do this.
Good luck.

19:12.895 --> 19:15.095
You know, I'm really
proud of you.

19:15.162 --> 19:18.429
You are really showing me
what you're made of.

19:18.495 --> 19:21.062
'Course, you're showing
that crowd out there too.

19:22.595 --> 19:25.529
But, you know, rock on
with your bad self.

19:28.462 --> 19:31.962
Synclaire, Synclaire,
when I tread the boards

19:32.029 --> 19:33.662
while I was in college

19:33.729 --> 19:36.029
I had the occasional bout
of stage fright.

19:36.095 --> 19:39.495
So, I'd just imagine
the audience in their underwear.

19:39.562 --> 19:42.362
However, in this case, maybe
you should imagine yourself

19:42.429 --> 19:44.262
in your underwear.

19:44.329 --> 19:46.262
Anyway, break a leg.
Alright?

19:46.329 --> 19:47.862
Okay.

19:47.929 --> 19:51.862
Okay, everybody, places.
Curtain in five minutes.

19:51.929 --> 19:53.995
I am so stoked!

19:56.829 --> 19:58.695
Hey, you okay,
my little showstopper?

19:58.762 --> 20:00.702
I'm so nervous,
I'm shaking.

20:00.769 --> 20:02.969
Oh, well.
Don't shake too much.

20:03.035 --> 20:06.669
You are here to inform
and entertain. Not titillate.

20:11.035 --> 20:13.335
When my camera is disposable..

20:14.469 --> 20:16.569
...what will ever develop?

20:19.169 --> 20:21.569
You know, actually, Vincent

20:21.635 --> 20:23.835
this is a fascinating
examination

20:23.902 --> 20:26.069
of societal values.

20:26.135 --> 20:28.569
You know, I disagree,
treacherous one.

20:28.635 --> 20:30.769
This is nothing
we haven't seen before.

20:32.902 --> 20:35.502
I think Synclaire's
big moment is comin' up.

20:35.569 --> 20:37.002
Shorty, look away.

20:39.202 --> 20:40.702
As agreed.

20:41.869 --> 20:43.135
[panting]

20:43.202 --> 20:44.235
No!

20:44.302 --> 20:47.135
No funds available?

20:47.202 --> 20:49.802
I'm zeroed out.

20:49.869 --> 20:52.435
I have nothing.

20:52.502 --> 20:54.635
Therefore, I am nothing.

20:59.669 --> 21:02.842
Alright, you guys lead,
I'll follow.

21:07.075 --> 21:09.775
(Synclaire)
Greed strips us of everything.
More ATMs inside.

21:09.842 --> 21:11.042
[camera clicking]

21:14.509 --> 21:17.175
Was that Synclaire?

21:17.242 --> 21:19.342
I just recognized her voice.

21:20.842 --> 21:22.842
I didn't know she could
run that fast.

21:23.942 --> 21:26.809
(Synclaire)
'More ATMs inside.'

21:27.575 --> 21:32.285
We should all go...inside.

21:34.418 --> 21:35.485
[applause]

21:35.552 --> 21:37.452
Is it over?

21:37.518 --> 21:39.118
I believe so.

21:39.785 --> 21:41.318
Oh, bravo!

21:42.852 --> 21:43.818
Delightful!

21:44.918 --> 21:46.118
Delightful!

21:47.552 --> 21:48.752
[applause continues]

21:53.718 --> 21:55.885
[instrumental music]

22:11.958 --> 22:14.225
[music continues]
