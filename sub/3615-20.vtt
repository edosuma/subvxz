WEBVTT

00:08.967 --> 00:10.967
Phoebe?

00:14.687 --> 00:16.887
Phoebe, you in here?

00:23.768 --> 00:26.068
- Hey, sweetie. Wake up.
- Cole?

00:26.168 --> 00:28.208
No. It's just me.

00:29.288 --> 00:33.568
- Come on, let's go home.
- No, I have to wait here for Cole.

00:34.288 --> 00:36.428
Phoebe, you can't just wait here,
all right?

00:36.528 --> 00:38.988
He will know where to find you.

00:39.088 --> 00:40.868
Come on.

00:40.968 --> 00:44.448
I don't understand.
He was supposed to go back under

00:44.768 --> 00:47.889
so that they wouldn't be suspicious
of him. But it's been over a week.

00:48.249 --> 00:51.249
He probably just hasn't found
a safe way out yet, that's all.

00:51.569 --> 00:54.149
But what if he can't?

00:54.249 --> 00:56.389
What if the Brotherhood
found him out?

00:56.489 --> 01:00.009
Look, even if they did,
he would put some sort of a spin on it.

01:00.329 --> 01:03.769
You know, get out of it.
Hey, come on, you know Cole.

01:04.089 --> 01:06.589
He knows what he's doing.

01:06.689 --> 01:08.229
You don't make
demon of the century

01:08.329 --> 01:10.849
without having a few tricks
up your sleeve.

01:11.169 --> 01:13.170
I just hope he's okay, Prue.

01:27.410 --> 01:30.470
It seems our brother's suspicions
were well founded.

01:30.570 --> 01:32.350
- Why, what do you see?
- Sickness.

01:32.450 --> 01:35.610
The kind that only comes from being
in the world of light too long.

01:38.291 --> 01:39.631
It's contaminated him.

01:39.731 --> 01:42.391
How is that possible, Raynor?
A demon as great as Belthazor?

01:42.491 --> 01:46.811
It's not his demon half that's
been infected. It's his human half.

01:49.491 --> 01:51.151
He's in love.

01:51.251 --> 01:53.591
- The witch.
- Not just any witch.

01:53.691 --> 01:56.511
One of the Charmed Ones.
But she's not only loved him,

01:56.611 --> 01:59.211
she's turned him against us,
sent him here to destroy us.

01:59.531 --> 02:01.472
Well, then we must destroy him.

02:01.572 --> 02:03.952
You still have
so much to learn, Tarkin.

02:04.052 --> 02:06.192
You don't just kill a demon
like Belthazor.

02:06.292 --> 02:08.512
- But he betrayed us.
- And in so doing,

02:08.612 --> 02:10.972
he's acquired the knowledge
of how to kill the Charmed Ones,

02:11.292 --> 02:13.272
something no demon's been able
to accomplish.

02:13.372 --> 02:16.352
That, with his power, makes him
a very precious commodity for us,

02:16.452 --> 02:18.592
one worthy of saving.

02:18.692 --> 02:21.932
- But how can you save...?
- How can we save him? Simple.

02:22.612 --> 02:26.253
We remove the only thing
that's reawakened his human half,

02:26.613 --> 02:29.253
his only foothold to good:

02:29.573 --> 02:31.973
The witch's love for him.

03:34.575 --> 03:36.275
Okay.

03:36.375 --> 03:39.536
Ou est la Tour Eiffel?

03:39.856 --> 03:42.936
That is "Where is the Eiffel Tower?"

03:43.296 --> 03:45.496
In my dreams,
if we don't get you a passport.

03:45.816 --> 03:48.716
Honey, we don't need a passport
to honeymoon in Paris.

03:48.816 --> 03:51.076
With the blink of an orb,
we can be sipping champagne

03:51.176 --> 03:53.176
at the Champs ÐlysÐ¹es.

03:54.816 --> 03:57.036
Yes, as romantic
as you make that sound,

03:57.136 --> 03:59.476
I would rather fly Air France
than Air Leo,

03:59.576 --> 04:01.637
just like every other
normal newlywed.

04:01.737 --> 04:03.797
Well, great, except that we're not.

04:03.897 --> 04:06.957
Well, a passport for you
could change all that.

04:07.057 --> 04:09.597
If I could just find...

04:09.697 --> 04:13.137
Voila. Birth certificate.

04:13.497 --> 04:15.517
- Where did you get that?
- From Dan's old file,

04:15.617 --> 04:19.216
the one that he put together
when he was suspicious of you.

04:19.536 --> 04:20.916
You remember him, don't you?

04:21.017 --> 04:24.037
Let's see, perfect hair, cleft chin,
tried to steal you away from me?

04:24.137 --> 04:26.138
Vaguely. Vaguely.

04:26.858 --> 04:29.298
This isn't gonna work.
I was born in 1924.

04:29.618 --> 04:31.738
No, you weren't.

04:33.098 --> 04:37.538
Okay. Off-white background,
black ink.

04:37.938 --> 04:39.798
Little trick I learned in high school.

04:39.898 --> 04:42.318
- You're forging my birth certificate?
- No.

04:42.418 --> 04:45.778
Just going to change
one little number,

04:47.418 --> 04:50.899
so 1924 becomes 1974.

04:51.219 --> 04:53.859
And just like that,
you are 50 years younger.

04:56.339 --> 04:59.199
Wait a minute. That makes you 27.

04:59.299 --> 05:02.179
That's younger than me. Maybe
I should change another number.

05:02.699 --> 05:05.339
- Piper, this is completely illegal.
- Yeah?

05:06.419 --> 05:09.039
Well, so is marrying
a dead guy, okay?

05:09.139 --> 05:11.159
Let's not get technical now.

05:11.259 --> 05:13.480
Morning. What's up?

05:13.580 --> 05:15.860
Oh, probably three to five years in jail
if we're lucky.

05:17.940 --> 05:19.760
Never mind.

05:19.860 --> 05:23.460
- Were you up late working again?
- No, I was up looking for Phoebe.

05:23.780 --> 05:25.840
Three guesses where she was.

05:25.940 --> 05:27.600
- The mausoleum?
- Yeah.

05:27.700 --> 05:30.500
- It's become like her second home.
- Still no word from Cole?

05:30.820 --> 05:32.360
No, and you know what?

05:32.460 --> 05:35.400
You would think that he could take
three lousy seconds

05:35.500 --> 05:40.381
just to shimmer and let all of us
know that he's okay.

05:40.781 --> 05:42.901
Maybe he can't.
Maybe he's afraid he'll get caught.

05:43.821 --> 05:45.821
Maybe he already has.

05:51.941 --> 05:54.101
Just follow my lead.

06:01.141 --> 06:02.842
Raynor.

06:02.942 --> 06:05.022
Good to see you're still
with us, Belthazor.

06:05.342 --> 06:07.702
- What happened?
- I tried to kill you.

06:09.022 --> 06:11.842
Accidentally, of course. I didn't
recognise you in your human form.

06:11.942 --> 06:13.322
My mistake.

06:13.422 --> 06:16.142
Not many are strong enough
to survive an energy ball, Belthazor.

06:16.462 --> 06:18.162
You're lucky.

06:18.262 --> 06:20.262
Forgive me.

06:32.303 --> 06:35.543
How could I not? After all,
you taught me everything I know.

06:35.903 --> 06:38.263
Well, not everything.

06:41.783 --> 06:43.163
How long was I out?

06:43.263 --> 06:45.163
Long enough for us
to investigate reports

06:45.263 --> 06:47.423
that you'd crossed over
to the other side.

06:47.743 --> 06:51.584
- Rumours, not reports.
- Don't worry.

06:51.944 --> 06:54.444
We don't blame you
for the failed hit last week,

06:54.544 --> 06:57.664
even if you were seduced by one
of the witches that thwarted our plan.

06:59.024 --> 07:02.324
I've already explained to you
that I was over her.

07:02.424 --> 07:06.904
Yeah, but you didn't explain that
she was one of the Charmed Ones.

07:08.064 --> 07:11.504
It doesn't matter that you stray,
Belthazor, as long as you come back.

07:11.824 --> 07:14.245
To that end,
I have an assignment for you,

07:14.345 --> 07:17.105
something that only your powers
can achieve.

07:17.465 --> 07:19.165
I need you to get me
a magical amulet,

07:19.265 --> 07:21.545
one that's hanging from
the neck of a witch.

07:23.745 --> 07:25.365
Problem?

07:25.465 --> 07:28.565
Just that it's a little bit risky,
don't you think?

07:28.665 --> 07:30.945
Sending me after a witch
with the Charmed Ones on my trail?

07:31.265 --> 07:32.885
Tarkin will provide backup.

07:32.985 --> 07:35.265
That way, if they show up,
you can catch them by surprise.

07:35.585 --> 07:38.786
That should take care of all
of our problems, now shouldn't it?

07:39.586 --> 07:41.586
Where do I get the amulet?

07:45.746 --> 07:47.946
This shouldn't take long.

07:50.866 --> 07:52.446
Think he'll actually get the amulet?

07:52.546 --> 07:56.306
Yes, but not before he tells his
beloved witch what he's about to do.

07:56.666 --> 08:00.546
And that should plant the first seed
of suspicion in her heart.

08:10.707 --> 08:13.267
Promise me when I turn around,
you'll still be there.

08:21.667 --> 08:23.947
- I thought...
- I know.

08:26.708 --> 08:28.708
I missed you so much.

08:29.548 --> 08:31.868
I missed you too.

08:38.388 --> 08:40.388
Hi.

08:42.948 --> 08:47.588
They've given me an assignment,
one that if I turn down...

08:47.948 --> 08:49.948
What do you mean, an assignment?

08:50.269 --> 08:52.269
What kind of assignment?

08:52.869 --> 08:55.149
I can't tell you.

09:00.309 --> 09:03.069
They've asked me to steal
an amulet from a witch.

09:03.389 --> 09:06.469
- A witch?
- Don't worry, I won't hurt her.

09:06.829 --> 09:09.869
Oh, well, that's good news, Cole.
You can't do this!

09:10.229 --> 09:12.229
You think I want to, damn it?!

09:12.589 --> 09:15.230
Phoebe, I just have to buy some time
so I can figure a way out.

09:15.550 --> 09:17.670
In the meantime,
I have to at least pretend I'm evil.

09:17.990 --> 09:21.950
Yeah, but don't you see? If you turn
into Belthazor, then you will be evil.

09:22.350 --> 09:26.790
- What makes you think I'll have to?
- Well, because an amulet protects.

09:27.150 --> 09:30.990
It takes someone of great strength
to overcome that.

09:32.910 --> 09:37.510
- Why do you think they chose you?
- To set me up, perhaps.

09:38.631 --> 09:41.711
- Raynor may be on to me.
- Who's Raynor?

09:42.831 --> 09:45.211
He's the head of the Brotherhood,
and my old mentor.

09:45.311 --> 09:49.791
He has the power to read thoughts.
And if he's read mine...

09:50.671 --> 09:53.311
Prue and I will come with you
and watch your back.

09:53.631 --> 09:55.331
No, no, no, you can't.

09:55.431 --> 09:57.451
That could be exactly
what Raynor is expecting.

09:57.551 --> 10:01.911
He could be setting me up to get
to you. I have to do this alone.

10:02.351 --> 10:04.352
Cole, I...

10:10.152 --> 10:12.272
Trust me, okay?

10:12.592 --> 10:14.592
I know what I'm doing.

10:16.472 --> 10:19.412
Just concentrate
on finishing the potion.

10:19.512 --> 10:24.112
If it works, Belthazor will disappear,
and Raynor won't be able to track me.

10:24.512 --> 10:26.512
Then...

10:30.353 --> 10:32.433
...we can be together.

10:50.753 --> 10:52.754
Prue!

10:53.594 --> 10:55.094
Prue!

10:55.194 --> 10:57.414
- What's wrong?
- Cole's in trouble. I need your help.

10:57.514 --> 10:59.774
- Okay, anything.
- We need to scry for a witch. Fast.

10:59.874 --> 11:01.874
All right.

11:07.714 --> 11:09.714
Who are you?

11:10.194 --> 11:11.614
How did you get in here?

11:11.714 --> 11:14.994
Just do exactly as I say,
and I won't hurt you.

11:15.315 --> 11:17.515
Just take off the amulet
and put it down.

11:17.835 --> 11:22.475
- I've been sworn to protect it.
- And I've been ordered to steal it.

11:25.035 --> 11:27.555
Don't fight me. I beg you.

11:35.595 --> 11:37.715
You can't take it from me.

11:38.275 --> 11:40.276
Maybe I can't.

11:44.516 --> 11:46.836
But I can.

12:08.797 --> 12:13.677
Tell no one about the amulet,
not even your whitelighter.

12:23.397 --> 12:28.118
Whitelighter. Is that my occupation,
or should I just put "guardian angel"?

12:28.478 --> 12:30.638
Hi, how you doing?

12:32.318 --> 12:34.578
What's the matter with you?

12:34.678 --> 12:37.738
We shouldn't be here, Piper.
This is wrong.

12:37.838 --> 12:40.218
Wanting a normal life
is not wrong, okay?

12:40.318 --> 12:42.438
In fact, it couldn't be any more right.

12:42.758 --> 12:46.598
For crying out loud,
stop being so good all the time.

12:47.998 --> 12:49.998
Newlyweds. First fight.

12:51.158 --> 12:53.299
- Eyes front.
- Piper.

12:53.399 --> 12:56.719
Leo, look, I love you,
but I'm getting a migraine here, okay?

12:57.039 --> 12:59.619
Just... Look, we're not hurting anyone.

12:59.719 --> 13:02.139
We're not breaking
any commandments, okay?

13:02.239 --> 13:04.859
We just changed
a lousy two to a lousy seven.

13:04.959 --> 13:07.839
- Next person in line, please.
- So let go before I blow!

13:09.999 --> 13:11.999
Okay, we're almost there.

13:17.840 --> 13:19.620
What?

13:19.720 --> 13:22.500
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no! No!

13:22.600 --> 13:26.360
You cannot leave right now, okay?
Pretend you're... Pretend you're out.

13:26.720 --> 13:30.120
- I can't do that.
- Yes, you can. Come on!

13:30.480 --> 13:33.260
- I gotta go.
- Leo, you can't go right now, okay?

13:33.360 --> 13:36.160
We've been waiting in this line
for two and a half freaking hours.

13:58.481 --> 14:00.481
Who are you?

14:03.121 --> 14:05.342
If you've come for the amulet,
it's gone.

14:05.442 --> 14:06.742
And yet you're still here.

14:06.842 --> 14:09.922
Living proof that Belthazor
has indeed gone soft.

14:10.282 --> 14:11.822
Belthazor?

14:11.922 --> 14:14.042
The demon who'll be blamed
for your death.

14:35.683 --> 14:37.683
Anything?

14:38.003 --> 14:40.003
No.

14:40.483 --> 14:42.603
Do you think maybe we scried
for the wrong witch?

14:43.563 --> 14:45.563
I don't think so.

14:51.363 --> 14:53.544
Scorch marks.

14:53.644 --> 14:55.544
Oh, my God,
do you think she's dead?

14:55.644 --> 14:58.464
Unfortunately, I don't know
what else to think.

14:58.564 --> 15:01.564
That doesn't make any sense.
Cole said she wouldn't get hurt.

15:02.204 --> 15:05.364
Yeah, well, somebody sure fired
an energy ball in here.

15:05.684 --> 15:07.964
Somebody like Cole, you mean?

15:08.284 --> 15:11.324
Phoebe, I am not saying
that it was Cole, okay?

15:11.644 --> 15:15.284
All that I'm telling you
is what I see, what we both see.

15:16.244 --> 15:20.165
For what it's worth,
I don't think it was Cole.

15:20.885 --> 15:22.885
Thank you.

15:23.325 --> 15:25.225
All right. But if he didn't do it,
who did?

15:25.325 --> 15:28.885
Well, Cole said that he thought
he was being set up by his mentor.

15:29.245 --> 15:31.905
So maybe he is.
Maybe they're trying to frame him.

15:32.005 --> 15:33.585
- Why?
- I don't know.

15:33.685 --> 15:36.225
But if it's true, that means
his cover's blown.

15:36.325 --> 15:38.445
- And we gotta get him out of there.
- Yeah.

15:40.005 --> 15:42.006
Leo.

15:42.606 --> 15:44.506
- What are you doing here?
- Looking for you.

15:44.606 --> 15:47.166
The Elders called me because
a powerful amulet has been stolen.

15:47.486 --> 15:49.186
- Yeah, we know.
- You do?

15:49.286 --> 15:51.746
Yes, and the witch that had it
has been killed.

15:51.846 --> 15:53.966
It was supposed to protect her.
That's why they gave it to her.

15:54.286 --> 15:56.906
Only the most evil of demons
could've had the power to take it.

15:57.006 --> 15:59.146
Why would a demon want
that amulet so bad?

15:59.246 --> 16:01.906
Because it's one half
of an ancient charm.

16:02.006 --> 16:04.106
Whoever connects
the two amulets together

16:04.206 --> 16:06.747
more than doubles
the protection power.

16:06.847 --> 16:08.947
With it, they become invincible.

16:09.047 --> 16:12.367
Well, that certainly explains why
the Brotherhood wanted Cole to get it.

16:12.727 --> 16:14.387
- Cole?
- Forget it.

16:14.487 --> 16:16.667
- Who's got the other half?
- Another witch.

16:16.767 --> 16:19.807
The amulets were divided between
two local covens for safekeeping,

16:20.127 --> 16:23.647
but the bearers have always been
kept secret, guarded even from them.

16:24.047 --> 16:26.687
Well, obviously that's why
the Brotherhood wants them both.

16:27.007 --> 16:29.448
Only to destroy them
so good can never use them.

16:29.768 --> 16:31.848
The amulet won't protect
anyone evil.

16:32.168 --> 16:34.668
All right, we need to find
that other witch before they do.

16:34.768 --> 16:37.148
Will you go with Piper
so I can work on Cole's potion?

16:37.248 --> 16:39.968
Yeah. Speaking of,
where is Piper?

16:40.848 --> 16:44.968
She's at the manor
recovering from a little problem

16:45.328 --> 16:47.328
we had at the passport office.

16:47.808 --> 16:52.928
- What problem?
- Well, she sort of blew some of it up.

17:03.449 --> 17:06.608
- Nervous?
- Impatient.

17:06.929 --> 17:08.749
Something you're not telling me,
brother?

17:08.848 --> 17:13.689
Actually, I was about to ask you
the same question, brother.

17:14.888 --> 17:18.369
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I had business to attend to.

17:18.690 --> 17:20.690
The amulet?

17:21.730 --> 17:24.690
Must feel good to be back in the game.
Was it a beautiful death?

17:25.369 --> 17:28.170
- What do you mean?
- The witch. How did you kill her?

17:29.250 --> 17:32.150
I didn't. I'd never risk alerting
the Charmed Ones

17:32.250 --> 17:34.310
just for the thrill
of offing a low-level witch.

17:34.410 --> 17:36.410
Too bad. I would and did.

17:37.530 --> 17:40.290
Don't make me clean up
after you again.

17:40.610 --> 17:42.231
You shouldn't have killed her,
Raynor.

17:42.331 --> 17:44.431
You're right. You should have.

17:44.531 --> 17:46.971
You told me to get the amulet,
you didn't say kill the witch.

17:47.291 --> 17:49.431
Some things go without saying.

17:49.531 --> 17:51.231
You want me to get
the second amulet?

17:51.331 --> 17:54.091
No, I want Belthazor to.

17:54.411 --> 17:57.571
Let Tarkin. My strength isn't back yet.

17:57.891 --> 18:00.191
I barely fought through the magic
to get the first one.

18:00.291 --> 18:02.551
You can do it. I know you.
You're the great Belthazor.

18:02.651 --> 18:05.892
You can do anything you want.
You seem to have forgotten that.

18:07.932 --> 18:09.932
Find the witch.

18:12.532 --> 18:14.572
But this time, show no mercy.

18:20.332 --> 18:21.712
You think he'll do it?

18:21.812 --> 18:23.592
We keep putting the bottle
in front of him,

18:23.692 --> 18:25.312
sooner or later, he'll take a drink.

18:25.412 --> 18:28.132
- What if he doesn't?
- Don't worry.

18:30.373 --> 18:32.453
I have insurance.

18:37.253 --> 18:38.833
All right, I'll start scrying.

18:38.933 --> 18:41.773
I don't think it'll work.
The amulet wards off magic, all magic.

18:42.093 --> 18:44.253
That must be why we didn't find
the first witch in time.

18:44.573 --> 18:47.113
We didn't get a read on her
until after the amulet was stolen.

18:47.213 --> 18:49.893
Okay, but what happens
if we don't find her before?

18:55.654 --> 18:57.654
Piper?

18:58.534 --> 19:03.294
- Okay, was it a demon?
- No, it was watermelon!

19:03.694 --> 19:06.394
Honey, why did you vanquish
watermelon?

19:06.494 --> 19:08.434
I didn't vanquish watermelon.

19:08.534 --> 19:12.134
I threw it up in the air, and I tried
to freeze it, and it exploded.

19:18.575 --> 19:20.575
This is the little problem
I was telling you about.

19:22.175 --> 19:25.975
Okay, Piper, slowly put your hands
down, and no one will get hurt.

19:28.855 --> 19:30.195
Honey!

19:30.295 --> 19:32.755
Sweetie, it's gonna be okay.
We're gonna figure it out.

19:32.855 --> 19:35.455
No, no, no, don't come near me.
I don't want anybody to get hurt.

19:35.775 --> 19:38.735
Okay, put these on.
Maybe this will help.

19:39.095 --> 19:40.555
Put these on and...

19:40.655 --> 19:43.076
Okay, now try the teapot.

19:43.176 --> 19:45.176
Try the teapot.

19:52.056 --> 19:54.196
Okay, okay. That wasn't that bad. It's...

19:54.296 --> 19:56.356
All right, just relax, okay?

19:56.456 --> 19:59.616
Just calm down. Because I think
your emotions are making this worse.

19:59.976 --> 20:02.296
I'll check with the Elders,
see if they know what happened.

20:02.616 --> 20:03.836
Hurry!

20:03.936 --> 20:08.137
Hey, and ask them how we're
supposed to find the second witch.

20:10.097 --> 20:12.817
- I know where to find her.
- Cole.

20:13.697 --> 20:15.597
I didn't kill her, Phoebe.

20:15.697 --> 20:18.517
- I swear.
- It's okay.

20:18.617 --> 20:20.657
I know. We believe you.

20:21.377 --> 20:24.257
You don't look so good.
Are you okay?

20:25.617 --> 20:27.617
I'm not sure.

20:31.178 --> 20:33.178
Come on.

20:38.258 --> 20:40.038
What about the potion?
How close are you?

20:40.138 --> 20:43.498
We're just missing one ingredient,
billings root, whatever that is.

20:43.818 --> 20:46.058
But as soon as I find it,
then I can finish it.

20:46.378 --> 20:50.098
I don't have much time. I'm kind of
hanging on by my fingertips as it is.

20:50.498 --> 20:52.978
Well, you have to hold on
a little longer.

20:54.018 --> 20:56.019
You can do it, Cole. I know you.

20:56.979 --> 20:59.139
Raynor says he knows me too.

21:00.179 --> 21:03.339
Cole, look at me. Look at me.

21:04.059 --> 21:05.999
You have to keep fighting it.

21:06.099 --> 21:08.619
You have to keep fighting him.
You cannot let him win.

21:08.939 --> 21:11.199
But me fighting is how he does win.

21:11.299 --> 21:14.359
Raynor's just waiting for me to slip
so he can drag me back into the fold.

21:14.459 --> 21:16.459
I know that's what he's doing.

21:19.180 --> 21:21.180
He can't have you.

21:21.820 --> 21:23.820
I won't let him.

21:24.740 --> 21:26.740
Then save me, Phoebe.

21:27.940 --> 21:29.960
I've been ordered to kill
the next witch.

21:30.060 --> 21:32.420
Now, you have to get there first
and stop me.

21:32.740 --> 21:35.280
Otherwise, Raynor will...

21:35.380 --> 21:37.380
...win.

21:43.181 --> 21:46.981
The birth and rebirth of all nature

21:47.301 --> 21:50.481
The passing of winter and spring

21:50.581 --> 21:53.461
We share in the life universal

21:53.781 --> 21:57.461
Rejoice in the magical ring

22:00.901 --> 22:03.821
I'll see you all next week. Blessed be.

22:04.141 --> 22:06.381
Blessed be.

22:17.982 --> 22:20.142
What are you doing here?

22:20.942 --> 22:22.682
- Just watching your back.
- Yeah?

22:22.782 --> 22:25.442
Well, watching it's one thing.
Stabbing it's another.

22:25.542 --> 22:27.122
What's the matter,
don't you trust me?

22:27.222 --> 22:29.282
- I don't trust anyone.
- You never did.

22:29.382 --> 22:31.243
That's part of what made you
so great.

22:31.343 --> 22:35.343
No allegiances, no conscience,
no hesitation.

22:36.743 --> 22:39.363
You know what Raynor wants.
Just give it to him.

22:39.463 --> 22:41.863
You'll feel better
after you kill the witch.

22:50.303 --> 22:52.303
Who's there?

22:57.984 --> 22:59.984
You can't hurt me.

23:08.064 --> 23:09.924
- Cole, don't!
- Piper, freeze him!

23:10.024 --> 23:12.104
I might blow him up.

23:16.664 --> 23:18.664
It's okay. We're witches too.

23:19.184 --> 23:21.185
Piper!

23:23.585 --> 23:26.585
Okay, that was good.
That... That was fine.

23:28.185 --> 23:30.185
Kill them.

23:35.985 --> 23:37.985
Phoebe!

24:00.946 --> 24:02.366
Leo!

24:02.466 --> 24:04.526
- He's our whitelighter.
- And our brother-in-law.

24:04.626 --> 24:08.387
I don't know what is up with me.
Every time I try to freeze, I flame.

24:09.107 --> 24:12.027
- Leo?
- I'm fine. Really, it's no big deal.

24:12.347 --> 24:14.967
Phoebe, it's a huge deal.
Cole tried to kill you.

24:15.067 --> 24:17.827
- He's the demon.
- And her boyfriend.

24:18.147 --> 24:21.047
We have very complicated lives.

24:21.147 --> 24:23.527
I'm just thrilled to meet you.

24:23.627 --> 24:26.027
I mean, I've heard of
the Charmed Ones, of course. I just...

24:26.347 --> 24:29.207
- I never dreamed I'd...
- Nearly die with us?

24:29.307 --> 24:33.988
- Yes, well, welcome to our lives.
- You saved me and the amulet.

24:34.868 --> 24:36.868
That's enough.

24:37.428 --> 24:39.608
May I?

24:39.708 --> 24:41.648
Well, the wound isn't deep.

24:41.748 --> 24:45.148
A salve would cleanse it
and ease the pain.

24:45.908 --> 24:48.028
Would you allow me entrance
to your herb cupboard?

24:49.028 --> 24:51.608
- Kitchen. She means kitchen.
- Oh, right.

24:51.708 --> 24:55.148
- Sure. Follow me.
- Hands down. Hands down!

24:56.749 --> 24:58.689
Come on. Sit down. Take it easy.

24:58.789 --> 25:02.349
I'm fine, Prue. Really.
And Cole did not try to kill me.

25:02.669 --> 25:04.949
He knew that the amulet
would protect me.

25:05.269 --> 25:07.469
He could've fired at you or Piper,
but he didn't.

25:08.469 --> 25:11.209
With the other demon there,
he made the only choice he could.

25:11.309 --> 25:14.469
- And you really believe that, right?
- Yeah, I know it.

25:14.789 --> 25:20.230
I saw his eyes.
They were filled with pain, not evil.

25:21.190 --> 25:23.910
Prue, we gotta get him out of there
before it's too late.

25:24.230 --> 25:26.410
Right. Then we better figure out a way
to finish

25:26.510 --> 25:29.790
that power-stripping potion, fast.
Come on.

25:36.150 --> 25:39.510
Check her out. Whipping it up
like it's Toll House cookies.

25:39.870 --> 25:42.370
Maybe after she fixes Phoebe,
she could fix me.

25:42.470 --> 25:44.571
Piper, you don't need fixing.

25:44.671 --> 25:47.571
If it's taking the Elders this long
to tell Leo what is wrong with me,

25:47.671 --> 25:49.671
then I definitely need fixing.

25:50.391 --> 25:52.991
This will feel a little warm.

25:55.791 --> 25:57.731
That is amazing.

25:57.831 --> 26:01.551
It doesn't hurt at all.
Hey, how are you at making potions?

26:02.431 --> 26:05.071
- Well, what do you need?
- We need to detox a demon.

26:05.431 --> 26:07.991
Yeah, and we need something
called billings root.

26:08.592 --> 26:11.632
Well, you have that. It's on...

26:12.472 --> 26:14.592
...the bottom shelf.

26:14.952 --> 26:18.352
- No, that's ginger.
- Now that's what it's called.

26:18.672 --> 26:21.832
In the old covens,
they called it billings root.

26:22.152 --> 26:25.112
Janna, you have healed me twice.

26:26.392 --> 26:28.972
Piper, do you think you could help
Janna with the potion?

26:29.072 --> 26:31.012
Just not point at anything.

26:31.112 --> 26:33.113
Only one way to find out.

26:33.473 --> 26:35.853
Hey, where are you going?

26:35.953 --> 26:37.613
To get Cole back here.

26:37.713 --> 26:41.153
If I'm right about what I saw in
his eyes, he'll go to the mausoleum.

26:41.553 --> 26:43.573
And what if you're wrong?

26:43.673 --> 26:46.833
Well, then he'll be back here
with his buddy to get the amulet.

26:47.473 --> 26:50.033
I'm not wrong.
Cole's not the enemy.

26:50.473 --> 26:52.653
He's the victim.

26:52.753 --> 26:54.873
And I'm gonna save him.

27:00.394 --> 27:03.014
How could you have failed?
It was just one little witch.

27:03.114 --> 27:04.894
No, it wasn't.
The Charmed Ones were there

27:04.994 --> 27:07.634
- just like I warned you they might be.
- We could've taken them.

27:07.954 --> 27:10.174
We would've died.

27:10.274 --> 27:13.494
- The amulet protected them.
- Which is exactly why I wanted it!

27:13.594 --> 27:15.614
What has happened to you, Belthazor?

27:15.714 --> 27:19.314
The witches' magic never stopped you
before. You never would've given up.

27:19.674 --> 27:21.615
What's changed?

27:21.715 --> 27:24.055
You know what, let's just drop
the pretences, okay?

27:24.155 --> 27:27.035
I'm tired of playing games.
We both know what you're trying to do.

27:27.355 --> 27:29.515
- It's not gonna work.
- No?

27:29.835 --> 27:32.015
You don't care about the amulet.

27:32.115 --> 27:34.095
You only care about turning me
against Phoebe.

27:34.195 --> 27:37.315
How smart. And yet foolish enough
to fall in love.

27:37.675 --> 27:40.055
Loving her is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

27:40.155 --> 27:42.275
You can destroy me,
but you can't change that.

27:42.595 --> 27:45.056
After all that I've taught you
and all that I've given you,

27:45.156 --> 27:47.676
you're willing to give it all up
for a witch?

27:48.236 --> 27:51.836
I'm not gonna kill for you, Raynor.
Not anymore.

27:52.196 --> 27:54.716
Not even for your father's soul?

27:59.916 --> 28:03.716
- Settle, brother.
- How did you get that? The Source?

28:04.036 --> 28:07.516
Promised to free him if you fulfilled
your end of the bargain.

28:07.996 --> 28:11.437
You kill the witch, come back
and finish your obligations,

28:11.797 --> 28:15.757
and you and your father
will both be free.

28:25.197 --> 28:27.137
All that separates us
from getting him back

28:27.237 --> 28:29.957
are a few drops of innocent blood.

28:30.597 --> 28:32.637
And they're about to be spilled.

28:40.078 --> 28:42.078
Cole.

28:42.638 --> 28:44.638
Surprised to see me?

28:45.918 --> 28:49.178
I hoped, but why did you come
after what I did?

28:49.278 --> 28:51.318
Because you need me.

28:52.158 --> 28:55.438
Besides, it's not like you haven't
tried to kill me before.

28:55.758 --> 28:58.479
A little energy ball
isn't gonna stop me.

28:59.159 --> 29:02.559
You know, I didn't have a choice.

29:02.879 --> 29:06.479
- I didn't mean to hurt you.
- I know, I know, I know. It's okay.

29:06.799 --> 29:08.799
We just need to get you back
to the house.

29:09.159 --> 29:12.379
Get that potion in you,
and you will be safe.

29:12.479 --> 29:15.219
It's too late for that now.

29:15.319 --> 29:17.319
What do you mean?

29:24.680 --> 29:27.800
- We have to hurry.
- Maybe I should shimmer us there.

29:28.120 --> 29:31.880
You can't use your demonic powers,
it's too much temptation.

29:32.240 --> 29:34.240
We'll just drive. Come on.

29:37.320 --> 29:40.840
"Shake water vigorously
for 200 heartbeats.

29:41.200 --> 29:46.881
Then add a pinch of dandelion
and a dash of chickweed. "

29:47.321 --> 29:51.281
- You're using bottled water?
- For Cole, the purer the better.

29:52.441 --> 29:55.081
- I got it.
- Okay.

29:55.401 --> 29:57.521
Time me. I got it.

29:57.841 --> 29:59.301
Leo should've been back by now.

29:59.401 --> 30:02.021
It must mean my powers
are screwed forever.

30:02.121 --> 30:04.221
They're punishing me.

30:04.321 --> 30:07.241
You're a fulfilment
of a great prophecy. Why punish you?

30:07.561 --> 30:11.002
Oh, forgery.
Wanting to have a normal life.

30:11.362 --> 30:12.782
Getting pissed off.

30:12.882 --> 30:16.522
By next week, I'll be walking around
like Carrie at the prom.

30:16.882 --> 30:19.442
I think that's enough shaking.

30:22.842 --> 30:26.722
- Leo, where the hell have you been?
- Hi. Easy, remember:

30:27.082 --> 30:28.822
Breathe, okay? Hi.

30:28.922 --> 30:31.662
Leo, Janna, the innocent.
Janna, Leo, the whitelighter.

30:31.762 --> 30:35.723
- Leo, why are my powers so wonky?
- They're not. They're advancing.

30:36.683 --> 30:39.563
Turns out your powers work
by slowing down molecules.

30:39.883 --> 30:42.323
And apparently, now
you can speed them up as well.

30:42.643 --> 30:45.363
Okay, but why now? Couldn't
they have picked a better time?

30:45.723 --> 30:48.303
Hey, okay, don't look
a gift power in the mouth.

30:48.403 --> 30:50.543
That one kicks ass,
and we may need it

30:50.643 --> 30:52.863
- sooner than you think.
- Why?

30:52.963 --> 30:55.023
Because when the two amulets
are joined together,

30:55.123 --> 30:57.783
only a spell can activate their power.
This spell.

30:57.883 --> 31:00.304
- What does that mean?
- It means that if the Brotherhood

31:00.404 --> 31:01.824
wants to actually use the amulets,

31:01.924 --> 31:04.104
they're gonna have to come here
for the spell.

31:04.204 --> 31:06.204
But I was told that evil
couldn't use the amulets.

31:06.684 --> 31:08.684
Maybe they've figured out a way.

31:09.244 --> 31:11.244
Hey.

31:16.124 --> 31:18.124
You look like hell.

31:18.564 --> 31:21.804
You have no idea.

31:23.005 --> 31:27.845
- Is the potion done?
- It still has to cool and turn blood red.

31:28.205 --> 31:30.425
I'll get some ice.

31:30.525 --> 31:33.525
I'll help you so you don't melt it.

31:37.205 --> 31:39.345
Well, look on the bright side.
You got a new power.

31:39.445 --> 31:41.465
You've been bitching about it
long enough.

31:41.565 --> 31:43.725
Yeah, well, careful what you bitch for.

32:01.486 --> 32:03.486
Try again!

32:11.087 --> 32:13.147
Phoebe, help!

32:13.247 --> 32:15.247
Phoebe!

32:16.647 --> 32:18.647
Phoebe, help!

32:21.407 --> 32:23.407
Watch out!

32:28.207 --> 32:30.207
Oh, please, please, please.

32:36.088 --> 32:38.088
I did it!

32:39.008 --> 32:40.628
- I did it!
- Very good.

32:40.728 --> 32:42.988
Of course, I meant to freeze him.
Are you all right?

32:43.088 --> 32:45.268
I am, thanks to you.

32:45.368 --> 32:47.508
I don't think Prue is gonna be
quite as grateful.

32:47.608 --> 32:50.128
Wake her up.
I gotta get back to Cole.

32:57.768 --> 32:59.769
It's ready.

33:13.129 --> 33:15.129
Leave her out of this, Raynor.

33:15.929 --> 33:19.849
I serve with every breath,
even my last.

33:20.209 --> 33:21.709
Love to take you up on that.

33:21.809 --> 33:24.010
But I think I'll save that pleasure
for my brother.

33:36.930 --> 33:38.930
Cole!

33:42.210 --> 33:43.790
I've come to take you home.

33:43.890 --> 33:45.390
- I am home.
- Cole!

33:45.490 --> 33:48.311
You will be when you kill the witch.

33:48.411 --> 33:50.591
Stop fighting it, Belthazor!

33:50.691 --> 33:52.431
You're a demon.

33:52.531 --> 33:56.531
Embrace it. Let evil make you
strong again. Give in to it.

33:58.131 --> 34:00.371
Cole? Leo!

34:00.851 --> 34:04.571
The rage in you is building,
but it's not me that you want to kill.

34:04.891 --> 34:06.891
It's her.

34:07.331 --> 34:10.091
Do it. Free yourself.

34:11.972 --> 34:13.512
No.

34:13.612 --> 34:17.371
Cole, open up the door
and let me in!

34:19.851 --> 34:23.292
Is she really worth sacrificing
your father's soul for?

34:23.652 --> 34:26.452
Cole. No, don't do it.

34:41.333 --> 34:43.333
Cole.

34:55.333 --> 34:57.333
Phoebe.

34:59.093 --> 35:01.094
What did you do to him?

35:13.854 --> 35:15.854
I saw what you did.

35:16.654 --> 35:18.834
It's not what it looks like.
It wasn't...

35:18.934 --> 35:22.254
Janna is dead and Leo is unconscious.
What else could it be?

35:22.614 --> 35:25.895
Raynor forced me.
I had no choice.

35:26.255 --> 35:28.895
There's always a choice, Cole!

35:34.375 --> 35:36.375
The potion.

35:39.295 --> 35:42.415
- Before it's too late.
- It's already too late.

35:42.735 --> 35:46.975
You killed an innocent woman.
There is no turning back from that.

35:47.375 --> 35:50.636
I didn't wanna kill her.

35:50.736 --> 35:54.176
You gotta understand that.
I can still be good.

35:55.056 --> 35:57.196
There's nothing good in you anymore.

35:57.296 --> 35:59.736
Maybe there never was.

36:00.056 --> 36:02.736
You have to read the spell
to activate the amulets, right?

36:03.616 --> 36:07.656
I mean, Cole, maybe that was
your plan all along, to get the Book.

36:08.016 --> 36:10.456
But evil can't use the amulets
or the Book.

36:10.776 --> 36:12.777
He could have if we'd
stripped his powers.

36:13.257 --> 36:14.997
Is that why you wanted
the potion, Cole?

36:15.097 --> 36:19.097
So you could get to the spell
and use the amulets against us?

36:19.937 --> 36:21.977
Oh, Phoebe.

36:26.857 --> 36:28.517
You gotta believe me.

36:28.617 --> 36:30.657
I think she's believed you
one too many times.

36:30.977 --> 36:33.157
Stay out of this!

36:33.257 --> 36:35.717
This is between me...

36:35.817 --> 36:37.318
...and her.

36:37.418 --> 36:39.978
There's nothing between us
anymore.

36:40.778 --> 36:42.958
Phoebe.

36:43.058 --> 36:46.198
Don't let Raynor take this away
from us. Don't let him win.

36:46.298 --> 36:48.978
Raynor didn't set you up.

36:49.298 --> 36:51.298
You set me up.

36:52.778 --> 36:54.778
What am I supposed to do?

36:55.458 --> 36:57.458
Please...

36:58.298 --> 37:00.299
...save me.

37:01.659 --> 37:03.659
Save yourself.

37:31.700 --> 37:34.240
Sorry about knocking you out,
nothing personal.

37:34.340 --> 37:36.540
Yeah, well, at least
you didn't blow me up.

37:36.860 --> 37:38.760
Yeah, I was kind of relieved too.

37:38.860 --> 37:43.580
- Piper, the control will come.
- Yeah, tell that to the ficus.

37:43.980 --> 37:47.460
- Well, you sure told it to Tarkin.
- That was kind of cool.

37:48.381 --> 37:50.841
So see, we can celebrate.

37:50.941 --> 37:53.821
You know, I mean, you got a new
power and you beat a demon with it.

37:54.141 --> 37:57.381
I wish I could've done more
for Janna and Cole.

37:57.701 --> 38:00.501
I mean, vanquishing one bad guy
and losing three good guys

38:00.821 --> 38:02.821
is not exactly a winning score.

38:03.821 --> 38:06.581
Okay, so we are still counting
Cole as good, right?

38:06.901 --> 38:11.541
Yeah. I mean, I actually
finally understand how he feels.

38:11.901 --> 38:15.142
Having something inside of you
that you can't control

38:15.462 --> 38:19.502
which is capable of hurting the people
you love even if you don't want it to.

38:20.422 --> 38:21.642
Oh, I'm sorry, guys.

38:21.742 --> 38:25.022
I didn't mean to stick you
with the morning-after cleanup.

38:25.342 --> 38:27.342
How you doing?

38:28.262 --> 38:30.082
I'm not sure.

38:30.182 --> 38:32.602
Well, you have a lot to sort out.

38:32.702 --> 38:34.762
No, not really.

38:34.862 --> 38:38.543
I lost my soul mate to evil.
End of story.

38:38.903 --> 38:42.443
- Pheebs, I think he really tried, but...
- It wasn't enough.

38:42.543 --> 38:44.543
I wasn't enough.

38:45.423 --> 38:50.583
I thought we could do a blessing
for our two fallen witches...

38:50.983 --> 38:52.983
...and for Cole.

38:55.823 --> 39:01.704
For Leeza, a lost sister.
May her spirit soar.

39:03.504 --> 39:08.304
For Janna, our lost friend.
May we meet again.

39:10.784 --> 39:12.784
For Cole...

39:13.304 --> 39:15.304
...a lost love.

39:19.864 --> 39:21.984
May you find peace.

39:25.345 --> 39:27.205
Piper, we're going to have...

39:27.305 --> 39:31.065
- Plenty of time to talk later.
- No, it's okay, Leo.

39:31.465 --> 39:33.485
We could actually use
some good news.

39:33.585 --> 39:35.365
And it seems like you have some.

39:35.465 --> 39:40.905
Well, I don't have news,
but I do have a passport.

39:43.025 --> 39:44.365
You went back?

39:44.465 --> 39:47.485
Yeah, well, I was thinking,
with everything that's happened,

39:47.585 --> 39:51.506
and your new power making life
a little crazy... All right, crazier,

39:51.866 --> 39:55.266
I figured that the least I could do
is make it somewhat normal.

39:55.626 --> 39:58.006
- Are you sure?
- Anything that it takes to get you

39:58.106 --> 40:00.106
on a plane to Paris.

40:00.866 --> 40:03.706
You know what?
I think we should wait on that.

40:04.026 --> 40:06.246
I wouldn't wanna, like,
sneeze at 40,000 feet

40:06.346 --> 40:09.546
and have a whole bunch of people
explode. That would be bad.

40:26.027 --> 40:29.107
I knew you'd come back.
I've been waiting for you.

40:29.627 --> 40:32.667
My father's soul, where is it?

40:47.268 --> 40:50.288
Or course, now that you're evil,
what can you do with it?

40:50.388 --> 40:54.228
- That's not your concern.
- True. You were my only concern.

40:54.868 --> 40:57.908
- How'd you get me to do it, a spell?
- Does it really matter?

40:58.268 --> 41:00.988
Part of you enjoyed it,
didn't you? Killing the witch?

41:01.348 --> 41:04.029
Not as much as I'm gonna enjoy this.

41:09.869 --> 41:12.489
You killed Phoebe's love for me.

41:12.589 --> 41:15.229
Now I'm gonna watch you die.

41:16.789 --> 41:18.789
I can feel your heart.

41:19.109 --> 41:23.229
It's racing even as mine slows.
You're enjoying this.

41:23.549 --> 41:25.610
I can feel it.

41:25.710 --> 41:29.150
This is what I hoped for.
Your inner demonic nature

41:29.510 --> 41:32.710
finally showing itself in all its glory.

41:43.630 --> 41:46.470
You're truly evil now, Belthazor.

41:48.670 --> 41:50.911
Welcome home.
