<i>Previously on</i> Gotham...

00:05.070 --> 00:06.670
Told you, easy as pie.

00:06.672 --> 00:08.505
What?
Sorry, Frankie.

00:08.507 --> 00:10.707
<i>Arnold Flass,</i>

00:10.709 --> 00:12.509
you're under arrest
for the murder of Leon Winkler.

00:12.511 --> 00:14.344
You really think these guys
are gonna let you arrest me?

00:14.346 --> 00:15.712
Shut up, Flass.

00:15.714 --> 00:17.280
<i>Penguin, come here.</i>

00:17.282 --> 00:19.383
You're a smart monkey.
But I'm the zookeeper.

00:19.385 --> 00:21.251
<i>I didn't think
it was going to be you,</i>

00:21.253 --> 00:23.086
my dear.
You can come out now.

00:23.088 --> 00:24.755
Right as usual,
my friend.

00:27.558 --> 00:29.259
- We got to go!
<i>- I swear, Butch,</i>

00:29.261 --> 00:31.995
<i>I'm gonna come back
and kill Penguin.</i>

Oh, no, please.

Don't, don't, please, please!

01:48.873 --> 01:50.173
Ah.

01:50.175 --> 01:51.908
You're sure, now?

01:51.910 --> 01:53.910
Fish Mooney is done.

01:53.912 --> 01:56.079
She tried to bring down Falcone.

01:56.081 --> 01:57.581
She failed.

01:57.583 --> 02:00.217
Last time I saw her,
Victor Zsasz had her cornered.

02:00.219 --> 02:01.618
We can assume she's either

02:01.620 --> 02:04.187
dead or extremely unwell.

02:04.189 --> 02:05.269
Well, then.<i> Salud.</i>

02:07.225 --> 02:10.860
Mmm. You know, this creates
some intriguing opportunities.

02:10.863 --> 02:12.162
Falcone will struggle

02:12.164 --> 02:13.663
to hold on to her territories.

02:13.665 --> 02:14.998
If we move quickly...

02:15.000 --> 02:16.633
My thinking exactly.

02:16.635 --> 02:17.635
In fact,

02:17.636 --> 02:19.169
I took the liberty

02:19.171 --> 02:20.537
of claiming her nightclub.

02:20.539 --> 02:23.340
In your name, of course.

02:23.342 --> 02:24.875
You did, huh?

02:26.310 --> 02:29.012
Good thinking.

02:29.014 --> 02:31.281
A bird in the hand is
nine-tenths of the law, right?

02:31.283 --> 02:34.017
Yeah. Yeah.

02:34.019 --> 02:35.352
Phone for you, boss.

02:36.487 --> 02:37.754
Speak.

02:37.756 --> 02:40.423
Hello, Sal.

02:41.425 --> 02:42.893
Hey.

02:42.895 --> 02:44.728
You sound surprised.

02:44.730 --> 02:46.596
Let me guess...
your little friend Penguin

02:46.598 --> 02:47.864
told you I was dead.

02:47.866 --> 02:48.999
As good as.

02:49.001 --> 02:50.066
Mm. I'm just

02:50.068 --> 02:52.969
on a vacation for a while.

02:52.971 --> 02:55.038
Huh.
I'm not going to lie,

02:55.040 --> 02:57.274
I thought I was gonna
end up on top.

02:57.276 --> 02:58.775
Instead, I got played.

02:58.777 --> 03:01.444
Turns out, Penguin has been

03:01.446 --> 03:03.346
Falcone's man the whole time.

03:03.348 --> 03:05.815
They played us both for suckers.

03:05.817 --> 03:07.284
Is that right?

03:07.286 --> 03:08.952
Ah, indeed.

03:08.954 --> 03:11.988
He told me himself, right before
I was about to gut him.

03:11.990 --> 03:14.157
You understand why
I might be skeptical,

03:14.159 --> 03:15.659
considering it's you
telling me this.

03:15.661 --> 03:17.661
Oh, wake up, dummy.

03:17.663 --> 03:18.995
You mean to tell me
this whole time

03:18.997 --> 03:21.097
you haven't suspected anything?

03:21.099 --> 03:24.134
That he hasn't made one slip
that he's had to explain away?

03:24.136 --> 03:28.038
Or maybe even you wanted
to believe his lies.

03:28.040 --> 03:30.040
But it still gnaws at you,
doesn't it?

03:30.042 --> 03:32.042
The doubt.

03:32.044 --> 03:34.711
It's right there. A smudge.

03:34.713 --> 03:36.179
Don't let it happen again.

03:36.181 --> 03:38.548
Maybe a couple of times.

03:38.550 --> 03:41.184
It's time to get your house
in order, Salvatore.

03:41.186 --> 03:44.554
And remember who put you wise.

03:49.794 --> 03:51.361
Not bad news, I hope.

03:51.363 --> 03:53.730
Nah. I got to go upstate.

03:53.732 --> 03:55.732
See a guy about a thing.

03:55.734 --> 03:57.234
Come with me.

03:57.236 --> 03:59.236
We can talk about
opportunities.

03:59.238 --> 04:01.171
Sure.

04:02.373 --> 04:04.407
Just, uh, let me
run home and...
Bup, bup.

04:04.409 --> 04:06.142
We got to go now.

04:06.144 --> 04:07.277
Right now.

04:07.279 --> 04:10.146
Super.

04:10.148 --> 04:12.882
I love a road trip. Yay.

04:12.884 --> 04:14.884
Yay.

04:20.559 --> 04:22.592
Harvey?

04:22.594 --> 04:24.494
Captain.

04:24.496 --> 04:25.629
What have we got?

04:25.631 --> 04:26.930
Sometime last night,
Mr. Lucky there

04:26.932 --> 04:29.633
got tied to that chair,
noose was dropped over his neck

04:29.635 --> 04:31.067
and he's heaved
over the side.

04:31.069 --> 04:33.236
Some suits coming up for a smoke
this morning found him.

04:33.238 --> 04:34.738
How'd he get back up
to the roof?

04:34.740 --> 04:35.905
See that pulley there?

04:35.907 --> 04:38.775
My guess: it was the killer.

04:38.777 --> 04:40.810
Guy went to a lot of trouble
to get him back up.

04:40.812 --> 04:42.279
Why not just leave him hanging?

04:42.281 --> 04:43.446
Morning, Captain.

04:43.448 --> 04:45.615
Morning, Ed.
The more you cut me

04:45.617 --> 04:47.117
the bigger I grow.
What am I?

04:47.119 --> 04:48.351
We're on a rooftop, Nygma.

04:48.353 --> 04:49.353
Don't tempt me.

04:49.354 --> 04:51.154
A hole. I'm a hole.

04:51.156 --> 04:52.156
Okay.

04:52.157 --> 04:53.223
Relevance?

04:53.225 --> 04:54.724
There's a hole,
a surgical incision

04:54.726 --> 04:55.859
in our victim's abdomen.

04:55.861 --> 04:57.794
Certainly postmortem.

04:57.796 --> 04:59.996
My guess: killer was
looking for something.

04:59.998 --> 05:01.931
I'll have to examine the body
more fully back at the lab.

05:01.933 --> 05:03.566
You mean
the medical examiner will.

05:03.568 --> 05:04.568
Well, but...

05:04.569 --> 05:06.069
You handle forensics, Ed.

05:06.071 --> 05:07.904
The bodies belong to Dr. Guerra.

05:07.906 --> 05:10.040
And he's made
formal complaints.

05:10.042 --> 05:12.242
I can't cover
for you anymore.

05:12.244 --> 05:13.943
I read you, ma'am.

05:13.945 --> 05:15.645
Loud and clear.

05:17.415 --> 05:19.082
So where's Gordon?

05:19.084 --> 05:20.917
Personal stuff.
He'll be in soon.

05:20.919 --> 05:23.853
Hey, don't stand
so near the edge.

05:23.855 --> 05:25.255
You worried about me, Captain?

05:25.257 --> 05:27.924
You know I don't
start drinking till noon.

05:27.926 --> 05:29.192
I got to spell it out for you?

05:29.194 --> 05:31.227
Detective Flass had
a lot of friends,

05:31.229 --> 05:33.530
and your partner
arrested him for murder.

05:33.532 --> 05:35.098
Accidents happen.

05:35.100 --> 05:36.399
You put the cuffs on him.

05:36.401 --> 05:37.934
So we should all be careful.

05:45.009 --> 05:47.344
To hell with them.

06:07.232 --> 06:09.299
Barbara?

06:44.803 --> 06:45.803
Hi.

06:45.804 --> 06:47.003
Let go of me.

06:47.005 --> 06:48.138
How long you been here?

06:48.140 --> 06:50.140
Just last night.

06:50.142 --> 06:51.875
And a couple times before.

06:51.877 --> 06:54.110
I knew your girlfriend
was gone,

06:54.112 --> 06:56.179
and I heard you got sent
to guard that loony bin,

06:56.181 --> 06:58.348
so I figured better here
than sleeping on the street.

06:58.350 --> 07:00.283
Have you seen Barbara?
No.

07:01.452 --> 07:03.787
Oh, so things are over
between you two, huh?

07:03.789 --> 07:05.222
Sure you should be here then?

07:05.224 --> 07:06.890
Maybe you're the one
breaking in.

07:06.892 --> 07:09.059
Came by to drop off keys.
Go get your stuff.

07:09.061 --> 07:11.194
Why? Where are you taking me?
Well, you're not
staying here,

07:11.196 --> 07:12.596
and you're not gonna
stay on the street.

07:12.598 --> 07:14.030
I'll find you someplace safe.

07:14.032 --> 07:16.833
Hmm. Safe.

07:16.835 --> 07:19.202
Safe like Wayne Manor?

07:20.171 --> 07:22.272
That was your last great idea.

07:22.274 --> 07:24.074
So someplace else.

07:24.076 --> 07:26.142
You're still my only witness
to the Wayne murders.

07:26.144 --> 07:27.844
Hmm.

07:27.846 --> 07:30.380
You haven't talked to Bruce
since he got back?

07:30.382 --> 07:33.583
No. Why?
Because I told him already.

07:33.585 --> 07:35.952
I didn't see anything.

07:35.954 --> 07:37.220
I lied.

07:38.923 --> 07:41.024
Sucks about your girlfriend.

07:41.026 --> 07:42.292
She's got
some really nice stuff.

07:42.294 --> 07:43.827
Hey, wait!

07:43.829 --> 07:44.928
Stop!

08:03.441 --> 08:05.508
Detective James Gordon
to see you, Master Bruce.

08:06.444 --> 08:07.777
Detective.

08:07.779 --> 08:11.281
Bruce, how are you?

08:13.584 --> 08:15.518
I'm fine, thank you.

08:16.554 --> 08:18.021
I would've come by earlier,

08:18.023 --> 08:19.923
but things were a little crazy.

08:19.925 --> 08:21.791
You were gone for a while.

08:21.793 --> 08:23.460
Switzerland.

08:23.462 --> 08:24.661
Probably wise.

08:24.663 --> 08:26.563
I saw Selina Kyle.

08:26.565 --> 08:28.164
She told me she lied.

08:28.166 --> 08:29.265
She saw nothing.

08:29.267 --> 08:30.333
Yes.

08:30.335 --> 08:31.801
That's what she told me.

08:31.803 --> 08:34.070
She made up the story
to get out of juvie.

08:34.072 --> 08:36.806
She could be saying this now
because she's scared.

08:36.808 --> 08:38.808
It would be understandable
after what happened.

08:38.809 --> 08:40.443
No.

08:40.445 --> 08:42.679
She doesn't scare easily.

08:42.681 --> 08:44.447
I believe her.

08:44.449 --> 08:46.649
She didn't see the killer.

08:51.489 --> 08:53.356
Look, this is unfortunate,

08:53.358 --> 08:56.292
but it doesn't mean
we're back to square one.

08:56.294 --> 08:58.495
Someone sent
assassins after her.

08:58.497 --> 09:00.463
Only a guilty person
would do that.

09:00.465 --> 09:03.900
Yes, and led her bloody
assassins to the manor.

09:04.769 --> 09:06.536
Thank you very much.

09:06.538 --> 09:09.939
Anyway, you need no longer
concern yourself with the case.

09:09.941 --> 09:12.709
Bruce, this isn't
the time to give up.

09:12.711 --> 09:14.077
I'm not giving up.

09:14.079 --> 09:16.246
I don't understand.

09:16.248 --> 09:17.514
Months ago,
you promised you'd find

09:17.516 --> 09:19.449
who killed my parents,
and in all that time,

09:19.451 --> 09:20.717
you've managed to find
one witness,

09:20.719 --> 09:22.252
who turned out
to be a liar.

09:23.621 --> 09:26.256
An investigation like this
takes time.

09:26.258 --> 09:29.159
I understand, but I don't
want you to feel bound

09:29.161 --> 09:30.660
by an oath
you can't fulfill.

09:32.063 --> 09:35.598
I'm releasing you
from your promise.

09:35.600 --> 09:37.667
I'll pursue the matter
on my own.

09:39.570 --> 09:41.104
Bruce.

09:41.106 --> 09:43.540
Yeah, no, I really wouldn't
bother, actually, mate.

09:43.542 --> 09:44.641
Once Master Bruce

09:44.643 --> 09:46.076
makes up his mind,

09:46.078 --> 09:47.877
there's no arguing with him.

09:47.879 --> 09:50.747
He can't pursue
this case on his own.

09:50.749 --> 09:51.981
It's too dangerous.

09:51.983 --> 09:53.683
Then I'll have to
look after him.

09:54.952 --> 09:56.653
Can I show you the door?

10:02.326 --> 10:04.327
Hey, sleepy head.

10:04.329 --> 10:05.628
We're here.

10:05.630 --> 10:08.431
You smell that air?

10:10.201 --> 10:12.268
That's country air.

10:14.204 --> 10:15.805
Let's get some chow.

10:19.710 --> 10:22.045
Chow.

10:22.047 --> 10:24.113
Excellent.

10:32.990 --> 10:34.524
So where's the guy?

10:34.526 --> 10:36.192
Which guy?

10:36.194 --> 10:38.027
The guy with the thing.

10:38.029 --> 10:39.462
Oh, he'll be along.

10:39.464 --> 10:41.564
You don't like the coffee?

10:41.566 --> 10:42.965
I like the coffee.

10:42.967 --> 10:45.468
How about the oatmeal?

10:45.470 --> 10:46.869
Also delicious.

10:46.871 --> 10:48.371
It's good to get
out of the city, huh?

10:48.373 --> 10:51.374
Away from the
fumes, the noise.

10:51.376 --> 10:53.409
I can finally hear
myself think.

10:53.411 --> 10:55.244
It's all so...

10:55.246 --> 10:58.314
simple and clean
and honest out here.

10:58.316 --> 11:01.484
Fresh air, oatmeal,

11:01.486 --> 11:02.819
good friends.

11:02.821 --> 11:04.487
How true.
In Gotham,

11:04.489 --> 11:06.489
we never have any time
to connect,

11:06.491 --> 11:07.957
to reflect.

11:07.959 --> 11:09.892
You feel that?
Absolutely.

11:09.894 --> 11:11.761
Mm.

11:12.463 --> 11:15.031
This guy with the thing...

11:15.833 --> 11:17.800
What is the thing?

11:17.802 --> 11:19.168
Stop worrying about that guy.

11:19.170 --> 11:20.970
You know what I
was thinking about?

11:20.972 --> 11:22.372
This is crazy.

11:22.374 --> 11:24.374
Indian Hill.

11:24.376 --> 11:28.077
You know, that dump in Arkham
that I traded to Falcone

11:28.079 --> 11:29.479
for your neck.

11:29.481 --> 11:31.214
How could I forget?

11:31.216 --> 11:33.149
I'm eternally grateful.

11:33.151 --> 11:36.018
You suggested it,
whispered it in my ear.

11:36.020 --> 11:38.788
It's worthless land.

11:38.790 --> 11:40.656
But was it so worthless?

11:40.658 --> 11:42.492
I mean, Falcone

11:42.494 --> 11:43.926
snapped it up pretty quick.

11:43.928 --> 11:45.294
It was a token.

11:45.296 --> 11:46.829
He simply needed to save face.

11:46.831 --> 11:48.297
After Nikolai died...

11:48.299 --> 11:49.932
Ah, see, you
wouldn't believe it.

11:49.934 --> 11:51.968
That's the other thing
I was thinking about.

11:51.970 --> 11:54.837
The fight with Nikolai
when Frankie was killed.

11:54.839 --> 11:55.972
What was he stabbed,

11:55.974 --> 11:57.840
like, ten times?

11:57.842 --> 12:00.176
I don't recall the exact number.

12:00.178 --> 12:02.145
Only, it was a gunfight.

12:02.147 --> 12:04.747
How'd Frankie get
killed with a knife?

12:06.417 --> 12:08.351
That always kind of bugged me.

12:08.353 --> 12:09.619
Honestly,

12:09.621 --> 12:12.155
I'm not much use
when things get physical.

12:12.157 --> 12:14.223
I'm sorry I couldn't save him.

12:14.225 --> 12:15.758
I was just reminiscing.

12:15.760 --> 12:18.261
Don't beat yourself up about it.

12:18.263 --> 12:20.696
We all got our talents, right?

12:20.698 --> 12:22.765
Yes, we do.

12:22.767 --> 12:24.200
Me...

12:25.736 --> 12:28.438
I'm deceptively quick
for a big guy.

12:28.440 --> 12:31.107
Yes, you are.

12:33.745 --> 12:35.611
I'm gonna go get some air.

12:36.547 --> 12:39.582
Wait for the guy
with the thing, hmm?

12:39.584 --> 12:42.885
The guy. Right.

12:56.268 --> 12:58.635
<i>How about getting it
right the first time</i>

12:58.637 --> 13:00.603
so we don't have
to keep doing this?

13:00.605 --> 13:02.071
Detective Bullock?

13:02.073 --> 13:04.374
It's my name.
Don't wear it out.

13:04.376 --> 13:05.441
I'm Scottie Mullens.

13:05.443 --> 13:07.176
You called me about
Adam Jodowsky.

13:07.178 --> 13:09.712
Oh... Oh, Miss Mullens, yes.

13:09.714 --> 13:11.347
Thank you for stopping by.

13:11.349 --> 13:12.982
Uh, Miss? Mrs.?

13:12.984 --> 13:13.783
Miss.

13:13.785 --> 13:15.885
Good. Good. Please.

13:15.887 --> 13:17.720
So...

13:17.722 --> 13:20.890
how did you know
Mr. Jodowsky?

13:20.892 --> 13:23.459
I was his sponsor, sort of.

13:23.461 --> 13:26.863
We're... we're in
a support group together.

13:26.865 --> 13:28.331
He's dead, isn't he?

13:28.333 --> 13:30.333
Why would you say that?

13:30.335 --> 13:31.534
This is a homicide division.

13:31.536 --> 13:33.903
You're a homicide detective.

13:33.905 --> 13:37.040
We found his body
this morning.

13:37.042 --> 13:39.475
Your number was
in his pocket.

13:39.477 --> 13:41.477
I'd just given it to him.

13:41.479 --> 13:43.646
I recently
started being his sponsor.

13:43.648 --> 13:45.048
Mm-hmm.

13:45.050 --> 13:47.050
So, uh, what kind
of group is this?

13:47.052 --> 13:49.052
Uh, for booze, pills?

13:49.054 --> 13:50.987
It's for people
suffering from phobias.

13:50.989 --> 13:52.855
You're joking.
Fear can be debilitating.

13:52.857 --> 13:55.391
It helps to talk
to someone about it.

13:55.393 --> 13:56.859
Don't be an ass.

13:56.861 --> 13:59.062
Excuse me?
You were about
to make fun.

13:59.064 --> 14:00.563
Don't be an ass.

14:00.565 --> 14:02.832
You're right.
I'm sorry. I was.

14:02.834 --> 14:04.467
No fun-making. Please.

14:04.469 --> 14:07.003
Um...

14:07.005 --> 14:09.839
what was Mr. Jodowsky's phobia?

14:09.841 --> 14:12.108
Heights.

14:12.110 --> 14:14.777
Hmm. So if he was found dangling

14:14.779 --> 14:16.779
from the top
of a tall building...

14:16.781 --> 14:19.082
Oh, my God. Is that how he...?

14:19.084 --> 14:22.118
I'm gonna need the names of all
the people in the support group.

14:22.120 --> 14:23.519
It's completely anonymous.

14:23.521 --> 14:25.288
Adam was the only one
I knew personally.

14:25.290 --> 14:28.491
You don't think someone
from the group did this?

14:28.493 --> 14:31.361
Could be. Killer certainly
seemed to know of his phobia.

14:32.629 --> 14:34.797
Are you Irish?

14:35.733 --> 14:37.633
Y-You seem like
you could be Irish.

14:37.635 --> 14:38.668
What's it to you?

14:38.670 --> 14:40.436
I'm just curious.

14:40.438 --> 14:41.771
When's the next meeting?

14:41.773 --> 14:43.172
Tonight, 6:00.

14:43.174 --> 14:44.340
And these things...

14:44.342 --> 14:45.942
they usually run, what, an hour?

14:45.944 --> 14:48.344
Mm-hmm.
So,

14:48.346 --> 14:52.348
you could maybe go
to dinner afterwards.

14:53.150 --> 14:54.851
Hypothetically.

14:54.853 --> 14:57.120
Hypothetically.

14:57.122 --> 14:58.988
Okay, well, I'm gonna keep
working the case,

14:58.990 --> 15:02.258
and I'm gonna call you if I feel
the need to go to this meeting.

15:05.362 --> 15:08.164
We're gonna find who did this.

15:08.166 --> 15:10.066
I promise, Miss Mullens.

15:10.068 --> 15:13.002
Okay.

15:15.973 --> 15:18.541
So I went through the materials
from the scene.

15:18.543 --> 15:20.209
Ropes and pulleys
can be bought

15:20.211 --> 15:21.711
anywhere.

15:21.713 --> 15:23.946
For what it's worth,
I, uh, traced the chair

15:23.948 --> 15:25.782
the victim was tied to.

15:25.784 --> 15:27.583
Yeah. I'm listening.

15:27.585 --> 15:30.787
Banker's chair, wooden, made by
some company in the Narrows

15:30.789 --> 15:32.388
that's been closed down
for years.

15:32.390 --> 15:33.589
Great. Let's go.

15:33.591 --> 15:35.625
You sure?
That's a pretty thin lead, Harv.

15:35.627 --> 15:38.294
Since when have you been
scared of a little work, huh?

16:11.094 --> 16:13.796
What was he after?

16:27.110 --> 16:29.011
Well, now.

16:32.182 --> 16:34.584
There! See?
I told you!

16:34.586 --> 16:35.618
Oh.

16:35.620 --> 16:36.719
Oh, dear.

16:36.721 --> 16:38.221
Get your hand

16:38.223 --> 16:40.423
out of that corpse.

16:40.425 --> 16:41.891
Now.

16:41.893 --> 16:44.427
I was just passing by,
and I, um,

16:44.429 --> 16:46.562
uh... I was... I
was just curious.

16:46.564 --> 16:48.564
What was I thinking?

16:48.566 --> 16:49.866
I... Sorry.

16:49.868 --> 16:51.467
Won't happen again. Promise.

16:51.469 --> 16:53.302
Do something about this
or I'm going over your head.

16:53.304 --> 16:55.538
I'm the medical examiner!

16:55.540 --> 16:57.473
Not this gibbering loon!

16:58.742 --> 17:01.744
I'm sorry, Ed.

17:01.746 --> 17:03.880
Till further notice,
you're suspended.

17:03.882 --> 17:05.181
Finally.

17:10.954 --> 17:13.589
But I found something.

17:17.361 --> 17:19.729
So, word around
the house is that

17:19.731 --> 17:21.897
you and Doc Caliente
have a thing.

17:21.900 --> 17:23.465
Thompkins?

17:23.468 --> 17:25.233
Yeah, kind of. I guess.

17:25.236 --> 17:27.470
So you and Barbara
are finally finito?

17:27.472 --> 17:29.005
Yeah.

17:29.007 --> 17:31.707
Dropped the keys off
at her apartment today.

17:31.709 --> 17:34.477
Get any of that
righteous breakup sex?

17:34.479 --> 17:35.845
She wasn't there.

17:35.847 --> 17:38.214
You notice I don't ask you
about your love life?

17:38.216 --> 17:40.883
My love life is an open book
and a short and nasty one.

17:40.885 --> 17:42.251
But I'm working on
the vic's friend

17:42.253 --> 17:44.587
in the phobia support group,
and unless she's the killer,

17:44.589 --> 17:45.888
I think I'm in there.

17:45.890 --> 17:47.256
You see why I don't ask?

17:47.258 --> 17:49.592
Don't screw it up
with the doctor.

17:49.594 --> 17:50.760
I'll try not to.

17:50.762 --> 17:53.062
Seriously, been willing
to forgive you on account

17:53.064 --> 17:54.864
of you're not getting laid,
but you mean to tell me

17:54.866 --> 17:56.399
this whole time
you've been making speeches,

17:56.401 --> 17:58.434
raising hell,
you've had a woman?

17:58.436 --> 18:00.903
The thought of
what you would do if alone

18:00.905 --> 18:02.572
is truly terrifying.

18:09.313 --> 18:11.247
GCPD!

18:11.249 --> 18:12.381
Drop the knife!

18:17.220 --> 18:19.121
What the hell?

18:27.064 --> 18:28.965
Thin lead, huh?

18:43.643 --> 18:45.243
Come in.

18:46.679 --> 18:48.213
I hope everything is

18:48.215 --> 18:50.014
to your satisfaction, ma'am.

18:50.016 --> 18:52.383
It is. Thank you, Captain.

18:52.385 --> 18:54.052
You can see

18:54.054 --> 18:56.821
Gotham on the horizon
if you want to say good-bye.

18:56.823 --> 18:57.889
No need.

18:57.891 --> 18:59.657
I'll be back soon enough.

18:59.659 --> 19:00.859
Well...

19:00.861 --> 19:03.461
if you need anything,
just let me know.

19:03.463 --> 19:04.996
I will.

19:12.238 --> 19:14.239
This lucky fellow
and the previous victim

19:14.241 --> 19:16.441
are both part of the same
phobia support group.

19:16.443 --> 19:18.276
Pigs. Go figure.

19:18.278 --> 19:19.578
How is he?

19:19.580 --> 19:21.346
He's at Gotham General,
scared half to death.

19:21.348 --> 19:22.581
The medics had
to sedate him.

19:22.583 --> 19:24.583
The man you shot...
was he in this group, too?

19:24.585 --> 19:27.219
Nope. No I.D. as yet.
We're running his prints.

19:27.221 --> 19:29.221
So is he our man or are we still
looking for someone else?

19:29.223 --> 19:30.989
- Hard to say.
- He's our man.

19:30.991 --> 19:32.391
These sort of wackos work alone.

19:32.393 --> 19:33.792
I'm gonna run by

19:33.794 --> 19:34.794
the support group,

19:34.795 --> 19:35.827
tell them it's been settled.

19:35.829 --> 19:36.828
Hey, we don't
know that yet.

19:36.830 --> 19:39.064
You need to be more optimistic.

19:40.600 --> 19:42.334
You do. You need to be
more optimistic.

19:42.336 --> 19:43.669
We have a perp.

19:44.937 --> 19:48.407
The postmortem incision on
the first victim is weird.

19:48.409 --> 19:50.676
The killer was after something.
I want to know what.

19:50.678 --> 19:52.344
I'm gonna ask Nygma
to take a look.

19:52.346 --> 19:55.013
No. He's been suspended.

19:56.349 --> 19:58.250
You got the report from the M.E.

19:58.252 --> 20:00.485
The same M.E. who said
my last witness stabbed himself

20:00.487 --> 20:02.254
to death in the back
with an ice pick?

20:02.256 --> 20:03.989
No. No, thanks. Nygma...

20:03.991 --> 20:06.525
Is not the medical examiner.

20:07.994 --> 20:09.628
I like him, too.

20:09.630 --> 20:12.664
But there's nothing I can do,
not with the way things are.

20:12.666 --> 20:14.700
What do you mean?

20:14.702 --> 20:16.535
Look, I'm glad
we took down Flass,

20:16.537 --> 20:19.771
but there are people you
go after and people you don't.

20:19.773 --> 20:22.174
So now everything we do
is being watched.

20:22.176 --> 20:24.576
You got the bad guy. Let it go.

20:25.545 --> 20:27.846
I'm sorry you got
dragged into it.

20:27.848 --> 20:30.182
Don't be.

20:30.184 --> 20:31.616
Felt good.

20:31.618 --> 20:34.419
Did, didn't it?

20:42.696 --> 20:45.531
Miss Kringle,
I came to tell you that I...

20:45.533 --> 20:47.833
Have you been crying?

20:47.835 --> 20:49.468
No, no. I'm-I'm fine.

20:49.470 --> 20:51.470
But I can see tears
on your face.

20:51.472 --> 20:54.406
Is it because your friend
Detective Flass was arrested?

20:54.408 --> 20:56.308
What do you need, Mr. Nygma?

20:56.310 --> 20:58.110
Yes.

20:58.112 --> 21:01.747
I've been suspended
and won't be seeing you anymore.

21:01.749 --> 21:03.549
So I wanted to return
this pencil.

21:03.551 --> 21:05.584
I took it from your office
some time ago.

21:05.586 --> 21:07.386
I kept meaning to return it.

21:07.388 --> 21:09.855
Used to be longer.

21:12.592 --> 21:15.027
You're an odd man, Mr. Nygma.

21:16.896 --> 21:19.698
But I'm sorry
that you've been suspended.

21:19.700 --> 21:22.034
I wish something could be done.

22:01.775 --> 22:04.109
Have a seat. We got to talk.

22:11.084 --> 22:13.519
I feel that the time has come
in our relationship

22:13.521 --> 22:17.523
when we should have
trust with each other.

22:17.525 --> 22:19.158
Real trust.

22:21.094 --> 22:24.530
Total honesty between us.

22:24.532 --> 22:26.098
No secrets.

22:26.100 --> 22:28.734
I 100% agree.

22:28.736 --> 22:32.104
So here's a secret to start off.

22:32.106 --> 22:34.907
There is no guy with a thing.
I lied.

22:34.909 --> 22:37.276
I was beginning
to wonder about him.

22:37.278 --> 22:38.811
Now you.

22:38.813 --> 22:40.746
Me?
We're being honest.

22:40.748 --> 22:43.449
You have to tell me
a secret in return.

22:43.451 --> 22:46.919
Secrets from you, Don Maroni?

22:46.921 --> 22:48.220
I have none.

22:48.222 --> 22:50.089
Please.

22:50.091 --> 22:52.324
Um...

22:52.326 --> 22:55.928
Honestly...
I don't really like oatmeal.

22:55.930 --> 22:57.329
Good to know.

22:57.331 --> 22:58.764
See, I like this game.

22:58.766 --> 23:00.733
I'll tell you another secret.

23:01.901 --> 23:03.469
Fish Mooney's alive.

23:03.471 --> 23:05.971
I spoke to her.

23:05.973 --> 23:08.674
Good secret, huh?

23:08.676 --> 23:10.142
What did Fish say?

23:10.144 --> 23:11.543
Oh, no.

23:11.545 --> 23:13.312
You have to tell me
a secret first.

23:13.314 --> 23:14.980
That's how it works.

23:14.982 --> 23:18.217
I don't much like coffee either.

23:18.219 --> 23:19.318
Fair enough.

23:19.320 --> 23:21.653
What did Fish say?

23:21.655 --> 23:26.392
Said you and Falcone have been
working together all this time.

23:26.394 --> 23:28.727
She said you've
been playing me

23:28.729 --> 23:32.064
for a chump
since the first day I met you.

23:32.066 --> 23:34.666
She would say that,
wouldn't she?

23:34.668 --> 23:36.902
The bitch.

23:36.904 --> 23:38.704
You don't believe her, do you?

23:38.706 --> 23:40.773
Well, she did put
some incidents

23:40.775 --> 23:44.009
in a different and
troubling light, I must say.

23:44.011 --> 23:46.011
Uh-huh.

23:46.013 --> 23:47.413
Well, that's too bad.

23:47.415 --> 23:48.781
Your turn.

23:48.783 --> 23:50.783
Tell me another secret.

23:50.785 --> 23:52.885
A good one this time.

23:52.887 --> 23:55.621
I took your gun.

23:57.257 --> 23:59.892
I have it right here.

24:00.860 --> 24:03.195
That's a good secret.

24:03.197 --> 24:06.198
I took it because I figured
Mooney had called you somehow.

24:06.200 --> 24:08.834
I knew you might believe her.

24:08.836 --> 24:10.769
Doesn't mean
she's telling the truth.

24:10.771 --> 24:11.771
Is she?

24:12.872 --> 24:15.741
Have you been playing me
for a chump, Penguin?

24:19.846 --> 24:22.881
I think it's your turn
to tell a secret.

24:22.883 --> 24:24.883
You little dirtbag.

24:24.885 --> 24:26.518
I treated you like a friend.

24:26.520 --> 24:28.520
Like a monkey friend.

24:28.522 --> 24:30.522
You're the zookeeper, remember?

24:32.292 --> 24:34.860
Tell me a secret now.

24:34.862 --> 24:36.862
Just one more then.

24:36.864 --> 24:38.397
I'm tired of this game.

24:39.499 --> 24:42.468
That gun is loaded with blanks.

24:42.470 --> 24:44.536
Liar.

24:50.977 --> 24:52.311
You...
Yeah.

24:52.313 --> 24:54.112
Good secret, huh?

25:05.091 --> 25:07.092
Hi.

25:07.094 --> 25:09.094
Hi.

25:09.096 --> 25:10.762
Thank you for coming.

25:10.764 --> 25:13.398
I was glad
to get your call.

25:15.368 --> 25:16.969
How are things at Arkham?

25:16.971 --> 25:19.338
Little less interesting
since you've left.

25:19.340 --> 25:20.472
Oh.

25:20.474 --> 25:22.174
How are things at the precinct?

25:22.176 --> 25:24.176
Um, well, actually,
that was what I was hoping

25:24.178 --> 25:25.410
you could help me with.

25:25.412 --> 25:27.613
Um, we've got this case,

25:27.615 --> 25:30.415
and I can't understand what
exactly our perp was doing.

25:30.417 --> 25:32.417
And our medical examiner
is kind of a clown.

25:34.487 --> 25:36.321
Uh, something wrong?

25:36.323 --> 25:38.991
No, not at all.

25:40.827 --> 25:44.296
Only, last time we met,
you were very passionate.

25:44.298 --> 25:47.866
So when you called me,
I thought...

25:47.868 --> 25:49.868
Well, whatever.

25:49.870 --> 25:51.370
I put on lipstick.

25:51.372 --> 25:52.971
And you want
forensic advice.

25:52.973 --> 25:55.641
You're very confusing.

25:55.643 --> 25:57.576
I don't mean to be. Uh...

26:00.046 --> 26:01.580
Case is a pretext.

26:01.582 --> 26:03.015
I wanted to see you.

26:03.017 --> 26:05.017
Why didn't you just say that?

26:05.019 --> 26:07.219
I should have.
I haven't done this in a while.

26:07.221 --> 26:08.253
I'm a little rusty.

26:08.956 --> 26:10.589
Sorry.

26:10.591 --> 26:11.957
All right.

26:11.959 --> 26:13.191
Well, good.

26:13.193 --> 26:14.927
I don't like to put on
lipstick by mistake.

26:14.929 --> 26:16.361
So what's the issue?

26:16.363 --> 26:17.796
Uh, no, no, no,
forget the case.

26:17.798 --> 26:19.197
Don't worry.
Please.

26:19.199 --> 26:20.599
I'm interested.

26:22.136 --> 26:23.869
Uh...

26:23.871 --> 26:25.437
Excuse me.

26:26.973 --> 26:29.174
Gordon.

26:31.210 --> 26:32.578
When?

26:32.580 --> 26:34.479
Uh, yeah, okay.

26:34.481 --> 26:36.548
Take his statement.
I'll be right there.

26:38.484 --> 26:39.952
I'm sorry, I have to go.

26:39.954 --> 26:41.253
I'm fine.

26:41.255 --> 26:42.554
You sure?
Yes.

26:42.556 --> 26:43.676
I'll bring this back to you.

26:51.231 --> 26:52.464
It's Harvey.

26:52.466 --> 26:54.466
Harvey, second victim woke up.

26:54.468 --> 26:56.468
Says he was abducted by two men.

26:56.470 --> 26:59.237
There's someone still out there.

27:02.341 --> 27:05.143
It's kind of you to come here
and tell us what happened.

27:05.145 --> 27:06.178
No problem.

27:06.180 --> 27:08.914
I just didn't want
you worrying, so...

27:08.916 --> 27:11.917
To be honest, you don't strike
me as the fraidy cat type.

27:11.919 --> 27:13.852
Phobics are not fraidy cats.

27:13.854 --> 27:16.855
I know. It's just, you seem
like a strong lady is all.

27:16.857 --> 27:18.356
I am strong.

27:18.358 --> 27:21.359
I just happen to be
terrified of swimming pools.

27:21.361 --> 27:22.761
You're kidding.

27:22.763 --> 27:25.764
Well, I can see how
that might be a thing.

27:25.766 --> 27:27.933
Nearly everyone has a thing.

27:27.935 --> 27:30.936
I'm sure that you, if
you dig deep enough,

27:30.938 --> 27:32.938
would have issues that
you need to confront.

27:32.940 --> 27:35.807
I'm a cop; the only thing
I'm scared of is decaf coffee.

27:35.809 --> 27:38.243
Really? I've always found

27:38.245 --> 27:40.212
that the best and bravest
people are the ones

27:40.214 --> 27:42.547
that willingly acknowledge
their fears.

27:42.549 --> 27:43.949
Maybe you've just
been hanging out

27:43.951 --> 27:45.917
with too many timid
and whiny people.

27:46.920 --> 27:48.587
You are so bad.

27:48.589 --> 27:50.956
I'm scared all the time.

27:50.958 --> 27:52.924
And it's something I'd be

27:52.926 --> 27:54.860
willing to share with the group

27:54.862 --> 27:56.962
if you think
it might be helpful.

27:56.964 --> 27:58.463
Yes.

27:58.465 --> 27:59.965
Yes, thank you.

27:59.967 --> 28:01.433
I think it would.

28:10.676 --> 28:12.510
First time?

28:12.512 --> 28:13.712
Yeah. You?

28:13.714 --> 28:15.780
No, I'm a regular.

28:24.518 --> 28:26.519
So here's the deal.
You go in the car,

28:26.521 --> 28:28.021
the car's already
in the crusher,

28:28.023 --> 28:29.355
you get squeezed to death,

28:29.357 --> 28:30.823
it takes a couple
of minutes to die.

28:30.825 --> 28:32.825
Whatever comes out,
I send to Falcone.

28:32.827 --> 28:34.861
Maybe he uses it
as a coffee table.

28:34.863 --> 28:36.729
Don Maroni, please listen to me.

28:36.731 --> 28:38.231
Oh, this is the begging part?

28:38.233 --> 28:39.832
Oh, good, 'cause this is
my favorite part.

28:39.834 --> 28:42.068
Go ahead and beg
for your miserable life.

28:42.070 --> 28:44.737
Just allow me to suggest
some options here.

28:44.739 --> 28:45.905
Mm-hmm.

28:45.907 --> 28:48.308
Dead, I'm worthless.

28:48.310 --> 28:51.311
If you factor in Falcone's
inevitable retaliation,

28:51.313 --> 28:53.880
killing me will be
a net loss for you.

28:53.882 --> 28:56.282
This is not a business issue.

28:57.351 --> 28:59.752
Me and Frankie Carbone
go back 20 years.

28:59.754 --> 29:01.154
You hurt me, Penguin.

29:01.156 --> 29:03.389
You were right
about Indian Hill.

29:03.391 --> 29:04.624
There's more to it.

29:04.626 --> 29:05.892
Falcone knows something.

29:05.894 --> 29:08.127
I don't know what,
b-but I-I can find out...

29:08.129 --> 29:09.129
Stop it.

29:09.130 --> 29:10.697
You're making me sad.

29:11.799 --> 29:13.566
How did I ever fall
for your crap?

29:14.468 --> 29:15.468
N-No.

29:15.470 --> 29:16.936
No. No. No.

29:16.938 --> 29:18.137
Please. Please.

29:18.139 --> 29:19.772
No. No.

29:24.778 --> 29:26.779
Hey.

29:26.781 --> 29:28.848
Say hi to Frankie for me.

30:04.451 --> 30:07.052
I'm afraid every day.

30:07.054 --> 30:10.956
I'm afraid I'm gonna die
in an alley.

30:10.958 --> 30:14.527
Bleeding out while some scumbag
goes through my pockets

30:14.529 --> 30:16.796
and laughs at me.

30:16.798 --> 30:19.732
And I try to speak,
but nothing comes out.

30:19.734 --> 30:21.567
And I just lie there,

30:21.569 --> 30:25.504
staring at a small space
of sky between the buildings.

30:25.506 --> 30:28.340
And then I die.

30:28.342 --> 30:30.810
Alone.

30:30.812 --> 30:34.480
I don't want to die
alone in some gutter.

30:34.482 --> 30:38.317
I want to die in a warm cozy bed

30:38.319 --> 30:40.286
in the arms
of a beautiful woman.

30:42.255 --> 30:45.624
Thank you for sharing, Harvey.

30:49.529 --> 30:52.231
Would anyone else
like to share?

30:53.867 --> 30:55.301
Tod, go ahead.

30:57.270 --> 30:59.138
My name is Tod, and...

30:59.140 --> 31:01.006
I've never
spoken here before, but...

31:02.509 --> 31:05.945
...I have a horrible
terror of failure.

31:05.947 --> 31:08.948
I torment myself
and those around me.

31:08.950 --> 31:12.751
I'd crawl on broken
glass to avoid failing.

31:12.753 --> 31:14.753
About anything.

31:14.755 --> 31:16.188
I inherited

31:16.190 --> 31:18.190
this illness from my father,

31:18.192 --> 31:23.362
but I'm afraid
I'm passing it on to my son.

31:27.968 --> 31:30.102
We're here for you, Tod.

31:30.104 --> 31:33.772
When I came home
from work yesterday,

31:33.774 --> 31:36.442
my precious son was crying,

31:36.444 --> 31:38.344
and he said to me that he...

31:41.281 --> 31:42.481
I'm sorry.

31:42.483 --> 31:43.515
I can't speak.

31:43.517 --> 31:45.150
I'm so sorry.
Tod?

31:45.152 --> 31:47.353
Tod.

31:47.355 --> 31:48.420
Tod?

32:04.238 --> 32:06.439
Oh, you got to be kidding me.
What?

32:06.441 --> 32:07.874
Don Maroni, you have
to listen to me.

32:07.876 --> 32:08.876
Uh, see, no.

32:08.877 --> 32:10.109
This is how this all began,

32:10.111 --> 32:11.111
me listening to you.

32:11.112 --> 32:12.945
I was telling the truth.

32:12.947 --> 32:14.213
About Indian Hill.

32:14.215 --> 32:15.448
And Arkham.

32:15.450 --> 32:17.417
Whoever controls Arkham

32:17.419 --> 32:18.818
will control Gotham! I can...

32:18.820 --> 32:21.287
Would you shut up
and take it like a man?

32:39.106 --> 32:40.306
Yuh-huh.

32:40.308 --> 32:41.741
Hello, is this Mr. Duffy?

32:41.743 --> 32:42.743
Yuh-huh.

32:42.744 --> 32:43.810
Listen to me very carefully.

32:43.812 --> 32:45.812
I'm the man in the car

32:45.814 --> 32:47.513
in this ferocious machine
of yours.

32:47.515 --> 32:49.449
My name is Oswald Cobblepot.

32:49.451 --> 32:52.418
And I work for Don Carmine
Falcone of Gotham City.

32:52.420 --> 32:53.653
Do you know who Don Falcone is?

32:53.655 --> 32:54.655
Yuh-huh.

32:54.656 --> 32:55.656
Good.

32:55.657 --> 32:56.989
I just called Don Falcone,

32:56.991 --> 32:58.391
and I told him

32:58.393 --> 33:00.760
exactly where I am
and what's happening.

33:00.762 --> 33:04.230
So, Duffy, you better stop
this machine right now,

33:04.232 --> 33:05.898
because if I die,

33:05.900 --> 33:08.000
Don Falcone is gonna send
a team up here

33:08.002 --> 33:11.337
to skin you alive
and slaughter your family.

33:11.339 --> 33:12.371
But Don Maroni said...

33:12.373 --> 33:13.506
Don Falcone

33:13.508 --> 33:14.874
runs Gotham,

33:14.876 --> 33:18.277
and you're about to murder
his right-hand man.

33:23.517 --> 33:24.617
What the hell?

33:34.127 --> 33:35.895
Hey!

33:35.897 --> 33:37.964
Get back here!

33:57.951 --> 34:00.453
Son of a bitch.

34:00.955 --> 34:03.355
Is it just me, or have those two

34:03.357 --> 34:04.857
been gone a while?

34:10.530 --> 34:13.931
This has been real and fun,
but I got to go.

34:51.900 --> 34:53.467
Oh, my God.

35:00.676 --> 35:02.777
This isn't what it looks like.

35:02.779 --> 35:05.446
Other members say our abductor's
been coming the last month.

35:05.448 --> 35:07.648
Said his name was Tod,
but group protocol

35:07.650 --> 35:08.916
requires they remain anonymous.

35:08.918 --> 35:10.351
So no real I.D.

35:10.353 --> 35:12.353
And the guy you shot,
the one with the pigs?

35:12.355 --> 35:13.854
Prints came back:
career criminal.

35:13.856 --> 35:16.190
Probably just the muscle.
The other guy was in charge.

35:16.192 --> 35:18.626
He knew there was a cop there
at the meeting.

35:18.628 --> 35:20.161
He still took her.

35:20.163 --> 35:21.862
That's cold or crazy.

35:21.864 --> 35:24.432
Either way, he's almost sure
to follow the same M.O.

35:24.434 --> 35:26.634
He'll confront Miss Mullens
with her greatest fear.

35:26.636 --> 35:27.768
Which is drowning.

35:27.770 --> 35:29.003
Specifically in a pool.

35:29.005 --> 35:30.204
There's hundreds
of pools in Gotham.

35:30.206 --> 35:31.206
We can't possibly get

35:31.207 --> 35:33.007
to every...
That was her mother.

35:33.009 --> 35:34.308
When she was seven,
Scottie almost drowned

35:34.310 --> 35:35.509
in Lemmars Park pool uptown.

35:36.511 --> 35:37.712
It's a start, I guess.

35:37.714 --> 35:39.274
That's where he took her,
I can feel it.

35:41.817 --> 35:43.818
Boss?
Uh, not now, Joe.

35:43.820 --> 35:45.519
Wait.

35:47.222 --> 35:49.390
Tell me that's not
what it looks like.

35:52.227 --> 35:54.295
<i>You're brave.</i>

35:54.297 --> 35:57.598
I'd say you're an eight
on the Crane Scale.

35:59.668 --> 36:01.569
Profound fear.

36:01.571 --> 36:03.637
12 is top.

36:03.639 --> 36:06.040
Abject heart-stopping terror.

36:06.042 --> 36:08.709
I'm surprised
you're only an eight.

36:08.711 --> 36:11.645
You do understand
that this is really happening?

36:12.681 --> 36:14.215
I'm going to drown you.

36:16.152 --> 36:17.284
Right now.

36:18.253 --> 36:21.122
There! That's a ten.

36:21.990 --> 36:24.058
Dad.

36:26.195 --> 36:28.095
Jonathan, I said
to wait in the van.

36:28.097 --> 36:30.131
The parking meter ran out.

36:35.337 --> 36:37.505
Look, son,
I know this hard,

36:37.507 --> 36:39.240
but we talked about it.

36:39.242 --> 36:41.809
It's for the common good,
for humanity.

36:43.879 --> 36:45.846
I know. I just... I think...

36:45.848 --> 36:48.182
This will be over soon. Here.

36:48.184 --> 36:50.384
Go and feed the meter.

36:50.386 --> 36:53.220
Go on, go.

37:01.830 --> 37:03.430
Now, my dear,

37:03.432 --> 37:05.266
don't think badly of me.

37:31.193 --> 37:32.359
GCPD!

37:32.361 --> 37:33.561
Don't move!

37:40.001 --> 37:41.435
I'm on him! You get her!

39:11.422 --> 39:13.890
He's alive.

39:13.892 --> 39:15.726
I told you he was alive.

39:15.728 --> 39:18.295
Praise the Lord.

39:18.297 --> 39:20.330
Glory be.

39:21.466 --> 39:23.734
What happened to you, boy?

39:23.736 --> 39:27.638
Like the prodigal son, ma'am,
I have fallen.

39:27.640 --> 39:28.805
Like Job,

39:28.807 --> 39:30.707
I've been tested
in the deepest pits

39:30.709 --> 39:32.843
of the devil's perfidy
and survived.

39:32.845 --> 39:34.911
Lord have mercy.

39:40.785 --> 39:43.353
Are you headed to Gotham City,
by any chance?

39:43.355 --> 39:44.821
Sure.

39:44.823 --> 39:46.256

40:19.157 --> 40:21.324
Case files you gave me
about that man

40:21.326 --> 40:22.793
who was thrown from the roof.

40:22.795 --> 40:24.127
Did you catch his killer yet?

40:24.129 --> 40:25.829
Uh, no. He's
still out there.

40:25.831 --> 40:27.164
Hi.
I followed up,

40:27.166 --> 40:28.699
and I had a quick look
at his corpse.

40:28.701 --> 40:30.467
A quick look
at his corpse?

40:30.469 --> 40:32.202
Yeah, its' just downstairs
at the morgue. No trouble.

40:32.204 --> 40:34.071
So the killer removed
his adrenal glands.

40:34.073 --> 40:35.539
Adrenal glands?
That's strange.

40:35.541 --> 40:37.374
They have no value
on the black market, do they?

40:37.376 --> 40:39.176
No. Kidneys and livers, yes.

40:39.178 --> 40:40.677
Adrenal glands, no.

40:40.679 --> 40:43.513
It produces cortisol,
the hormone that gives us

40:43.515 --> 40:45.716
that adrenalized
fight-or-flight reaction.

40:45.718 --> 40:47.884
Essentially, it's
the fear gland.

40:47.886 --> 40:50.821
And our man wants to take it
from the victim

40:50.823 --> 40:52.956
when he's most fearful.
Why do that?

40:52.958 --> 40:55.459
All I can think of is that
at the moment of death,

40:55.461 --> 40:57.794
the victim's adrenals
would produce a massive,

40:57.796 --> 40:59.763
highly-elevated form
of cortisol.

40:59.765 --> 41:01.431
Fascinating, huh?

41:01.433 --> 41:03.133
This is one weird dude.

41:03.135 --> 41:05.902
A doctor or a nurse,
most likely.

41:05.904 --> 41:08.739
Takes some skill to remove
adrenals as cleanly as they did.

41:08.741 --> 41:10.640
You really like
this kind of work, huh?

41:10.642 --> 41:11.908
I do.

41:11.910 --> 41:13.076
Good.

41:13.078 --> 41:14.444
Maybe there'll be more for you.

41:14.446 --> 41:17.180
A full-time job, even.

41:17.182 --> 41:19.316
Our M.E. has been fired
for stealing body parts.

41:19.318 --> 41:20.450
Can you believe that?

41:20.452 --> 41:22.085
Only in Gotham.

41:22.087 --> 41:26.456
So, what do you say we discuss
this potential job

41:26.458 --> 41:28.091
over dinner?

41:29.093 --> 41:31.261
Nice segue, Mr. Smooth.

41:31.263 --> 41:32.496
Thank you.

41:32.498 --> 41:34.464
Dinner sounds good.

41:34.466 --> 41:37.033
Are you gonna bring
your case files?

41:37.035 --> 41:39.136
Go ahead, mock my crude
dating skills.

41:39.138 --> 41:40.871
I'm doing my best.

41:40.873 --> 41:43.039
You're doing fine.

41:46.010 --> 41:49.079
I have a powerful urge
to kiss you right now.

41:50.047 --> 41:52.282
Why don't you?

41:57.021 --> 41:58.622
Because I'm on duty,

41:58.624 --> 42:01.224
and, uh...

42:01.226 --> 42:03.093
there's about 50 people
watching us.

42:03.095 --> 42:04.561
Scaredy-cat.

42:04.563 --> 42:06.696
Damn straight.
I have an image to keep up.

42:06.698 --> 42:09.933
The heartless, by-the-book,
hard man.

42:09.935 --> 42:11.168
Kind of.

42:12.303 --> 42:14.571
On the count of three,
I'm gonna lean in,

42:14.573 --> 42:15.739
so that it's subtle.

42:15.741 --> 42:16.773
Then you're gonna kiss me

42:16.775 --> 42:18.441
on the cheek or no dinner.

42:18.443 --> 42:19.976
Come on.
I'm serious.

42:23.114 --> 42:25.615
One,

42:25.617 --> 42:28.418
two,

42:28.420 --> 42:30.020
three.

42:48.473 --> 42:50.574
I'm not leaving after all.

42:50.576 --> 42:52.576
What?

42:52.578 --> 42:54.545
It turns out that
the medical examiner is leaving,

42:54.547 --> 42:56.547
so Captain Essen decided
to reinstate me.

42:56.549 --> 42:57.915
Oh.

42:57.917 --> 43:00.350
Okay, good.

43:03.688 --> 43:05.589
Mr. Nygma?

43:08.526 --> 43:11.495
You owe me a new pencil.

43:28.746 --> 43:29.947
What's going on?
What's happening?

43:29.949 --> 43:30.949
I can hide you.

43:30.950 --> 43:32.215
Quickly.
