I smelled the smoke,

01:12.971 --> 01:15.207
and I didn't open the door,

01:15.274 --> 01:17.376
and that was my mistake,

01:17.442 --> 01:19.911
but I panicked.

01:19.978 --> 01:22.714
I've never had to deal
with anything like this before.

01:26.985 --> 01:28.753
It was crystal meth.

01:31.256 --> 01:32.557
Are you on the phone?

01:32.624 --> 01:33.958
I gotta go.

01:37.096 --> 01:38.029
Thank you.

01:39.698 --> 01:40.632
Hmm.

01:40.699 --> 01:41.933
Who was that?

01:42.000 --> 01:43.068
Where?

01:43.135 --> 01:44.569
On the phone.

01:44.636 --> 01:46.271
Oh, uh, nobody.

01:46.338 --> 01:48.307
Highly unprofessional.

01:48.373 --> 01:51.576
Highly unprofessional.

01:51.643 --> 01:53.545
I know.
Look, it was Tom Lipsky,

01:53.612 --> 01:56.281
and we talk about these
kind of things, and he asked.

01:56.348 --> 01:59.518
You don't talk to clients
about your personal life.

01:59.584 --> 02:00.985
I... I know that,
but I was just...

02:01.052 --> 02:03.662
I was going through
the events of today,

02:03.728 --> 02:05.230
and I started to think

02:05.297 --> 02:07.299
maybe there's another way
we can approach this...

02:07.366 --> 02:08.833
Don't you dare.

02:08.900 --> 02:10.801
Don't you dare try to back out.

02:10.869 --> 02:13.272
Jeanette, fine!

02:13.338 --> 02:14.939
Fine!

02:15.006 --> 02:17.909
Jeanette, I said, "Fine," okay?

02:17.975 --> 02:20.579
The Facebook invite
went out days ago.

02:20.645 --> 02:22.281
I freaking Facebooked it.

02:22.347 --> 02:23.948
Do you even get that?!

02:24.015 --> 02:25.317
Yes, I understand,

02:25.384 --> 02:26.985
but if his own mother's
not coming,

02:27.051 --> 02:28.787
maybe we should
just postpone it.

02:28.853 --> 02:30.689
You don't postpone it.

02:30.755 --> 02:33.892
You put out the invite,
you gather who you can,

02:33.958 --> 02:37.262
and you confront it,
like the Women's March!

02:37.329 --> 02:38.430
What?

02:38.497 --> 02:40.399
The Facebook-organized
revolts.

02:40.465 --> 02:41.866
This isn't the same as that.

02:43.001 --> 02:43.868
Ed...

02:45.437 --> 02:47.939
we're talking
about saving your son's life.

02:55.747 --> 02:58.183
Repeat after me.

02:58.250 --> 03:03.795
Today at noon, we are
having the intervention.

03:07.932 --> 03:09.033
Yeah, I know. It's weird.

03:09.101 --> 03:10.469
My dad found a crack pipe

03:10.535 --> 03:12.371
in my little brother's room
or something.

03:12.437 --> 03:13.905
- Mm-hmm.
- So trite.

03:15.540 --> 03:17.176
But that's life.

03:20.545 --> 03:21.746
I don't know. It's weird.

03:21.813 --> 03:24.516
It's like,
you think when you grow up

03:24.583 --> 03:28.520
and get your own apartment
and boyfriend,

03:28.587 --> 03:30.722
your family shit won't follow
you around, but it's just like...

03:30.789 --> 03:33.192
I know, babe. That why
you have to take this anger

03:33.258 --> 03:34.993
and this sexuality
and put it in your art.

03:35.060 --> 03:36.995
I know, but we have
to go, though, okay, baby?

03:37.062 --> 03:38.197
- Uh-huh. Oh, God.
- He's my blood.

03:38.263 --> 03:39.864
So loyal. I love you, baby.

03:42.601 --> 03:44.069
Ah, I'm the shelter
in the storm.

03:44.136 --> 03:45.070
Oh, my God.

03:46.905 --> 03:49.341
I watched my mother
give birth in her bedroom

03:49.408 --> 03:51.576
when I was 16 years old.

03:51.643 --> 03:52.777
Yeah.

03:55.013 --> 03:58.217
Wow, your own mother?

03:58.283 --> 04:02.561
Yeah. Midwives
coming and going, but not me.

04:02.627 --> 04:05.597
I stayed right there,
and I held her hand

04:05.664 --> 04:08.467
through every labor pain
and contraction.

04:10.169 --> 04:12.137
God, you know, after witnessing

04:12.204 --> 04:14.806
the miracle
of childbirth, well,

04:14.873 --> 04:18.110
I never looked at my mother's
vagina the same way again. Heh.

04:19.644 --> 04:23.315
Oh, um, I have to conclude
my examinations

04:23.382 --> 04:25.084
a little early today.
My friend...

04:25.150 --> 04:28.653
My best friend has had
a real string of bad luck,

04:28.720 --> 04:31.690
and I... I'll be darned if I'm
not gonna be by his side

04:31.756 --> 04:35.427
holding his hand, too,
so thanks for understanding.

04:38.796 --> 04:40.765
Keeping your hips closed
just a tad longer, Rick,

04:40.832 --> 04:41.966
'cause you're
flailing 'em again.

04:42.033 --> 04:43.235
I guess, as a married man,

04:43.302 --> 04:44.969
my hips are a little rusty,
you know?

04:45.036 --> 04:46.871
Oh, yeah. I hear you.

04:48.440 --> 04:50.209
Yeah. Not that I, uh,

04:50.275 --> 04:54.613
miss being young and reckless
one damn bit, 'cause I don't.

04:54.679 --> 04:58.650
I got way too much
to fill my cup these days.

04:58.717 --> 05:00.692
My cup is full!

05:04.863 --> 05:07.199
I do feel bad
for my brother, though.

05:07.266 --> 05:10.702
I told you about that, right,
with his kid, what's going on?

05:10.769 --> 05:12.337
Breaks your heart.

05:13.505 --> 05:15.440
Not that I fear it.

05:16.908 --> 05:18.843
I don't fear nothin'.

05:22.481 --> 05:24.015
Except maybe my wife.

05:24.083 --> 05:25.950
She scares the hell out of me.

05:27.452 --> 05:29.154
Clarice is my wife.

05:29.221 --> 05:30.322
We live in Nebraska.

05:30.389 --> 05:33.057
Yes. We live in Nebraska.

05:33.125 --> 05:35.694
We're here to see Ed.

05:35.760 --> 05:39.030
Ed's wife Marley
is my first cousin

05:39.098 --> 05:42.367
on my father's side,
which makes the boy...

05:42.434 --> 05:43.502
- And the girl.
- and...

05:43.568 --> 05:46.071
Yes, and the girl
my relatives.

05:47.572 --> 05:49.174
Mmm.

05:49.241 --> 05:51.876
This trip is for pleasure
and for work.

05:51.943 --> 05:54.012
We run
an eBay business together.

05:54.079 --> 05:55.747
We are incorporated.

05:55.814 --> 05:57.549
Yes. We've done quite well.

05:57.616 --> 05:58.583
Quite well.

06:56.115 --> 06:57.716
We'll move to the mountains.

06:57.782 --> 06:59.484
- You say that.
- We'll go to the mountains.

06:59.551 --> 07:01.693
- We'll have babies, yeah.
- Oh, God.

07:01.760 --> 07:03.628
Are you the boy?

07:05.230 --> 07:06.231
What?

07:06.298 --> 07:08.100
Are you the troubled boy?

07:08.167 --> 07:10.102
Oh, no.

07:10.169 --> 07:12.071
Oh, this is... this is Tom.

07:12.137 --> 07:13.638
Hi. Tom.

07:13.705 --> 07:14.639
I'm Clarice.

07:15.740 --> 07:17.176
Ding-dong.

07:18.343 --> 07:19.444
Ed!

07:19.511 --> 07:21.346
Which Ed are you talking to?

07:21.413 --> 07:23.948
Uh, no, I was talking
to myself, Ed.

07:24.015 --> 07:25.650
So was I, Ed.

07:25.717 --> 07:27.519
You talkin' to me?

07:27.586 --> 07:29.254
Are you talkin' to me,

07:29.321 --> 07:31.156
'cause there's nobody else
in this room right now.

07:33.057 --> 07:35.627
Oh, gosh. Gosh.

07:35.694 --> 07:37.362
How you doing, old friend?

07:37.429 --> 07:38.863
- I'm hanging in.
- Yeah.

07:38.930 --> 07:40.432
I'm hanging in, Ed.

07:40.499 --> 07:41.633
- Hey.
- Rick!

07:41.700 --> 07:43.034
I brought you flowers.

07:43.102 --> 07:45.337
- Ah, thanks, bro.
- Yeah.

07:45.404 --> 07:47.172
You can just put 'em
anywhere, wherever.

07:47.239 --> 07:49.441
- Sure. All right.
- I don't care.

07:49.508 --> 07:51.543
We're gonna fix this.
You understand?

07:51.610 --> 07:52.777
I'm gonna find a way.

07:52.844 --> 07:54.146
Do you trust me?

07:54.213 --> 07:56.047
- Yeah.
- All I needed to hear.

07:56.115 --> 07:57.849
I'm with you
all the way to the end.

07:57.916 --> 07:59.151
- Thanks.
- Okay?

07:59.218 --> 08:01.019
- It was nice of you to come.
- Of course.

08:01.086 --> 08:03.462
So, uh, where's the wife?

08:03.528 --> 08:05.397
Ice-skating tournament in
Vegas with the girls all week.

08:05.464 --> 08:06.531
I text you about this.

08:06.598 --> 08:09.768
Oh.
Well, thank you for coming,

08:09.834 --> 08:12.036
even though they
couldn't make us a priority.

08:12.104 --> 08:13.438
It's a big tourney, bro.

08:13.505 --> 08:15.240
One of the judges
is Scott Hamilton.

08:16.408 --> 08:17.909
I'm... I'm sorry.

08:17.976 --> 08:19.344
I'm sorry I took a dig there.

08:19.411 --> 08:21.045
- Yeah.
- I'm... I'm not myself lately.

08:21.113 --> 08:22.481
I understand.

08:22.547 --> 08:24.015
I'm on edge
like you wouldn't believe.

08:24.083 --> 08:26.151
No worries. What about you?
You hear from the wife?

08:26.218 --> 08:28.420
Ah, I don't think
I have a wife anymore.

08:28.487 --> 08:29.554
Don't say that.

08:29.621 --> 08:30.989
She didn't have the decency

08:31.055 --> 08:33.325
to even say she wasn't coming,
not a word.

08:33.392 --> 08:35.760
Two years, not a word.

08:35.827 --> 08:37.196
It's unbelievable.

08:37.261 --> 08:38.263
I don't know.

08:38.330 --> 08:39.898
I don't know, bro.

08:41.600 --> 08:44.169
You look at me right here.

08:44.236 --> 08:45.237
Are you looking?

08:45.304 --> 08:46.571
Yeah.

08:51.843 --> 08:54.579
Oh, baby. Mmm.

08:55.747 --> 08:56.948
Oh, thanks, man.

08:57.015 --> 08:58.583
Oh.

09:01.126 --> 09:02.461
- Hi.
- Hey.

09:02.527 --> 09:04.263
- You must be Mitch.
- Yes.

09:04.329 --> 09:06.765
- I'm Clarice.
- I know that from Facebook.

09:06.831 --> 09:09.268
Thank you for inviting us
to your intervention.

09:09.334 --> 09:10.969
You really went to town.

09:11.035 --> 09:12.271
Yeah.

09:12.337 --> 09:14.473
Well, enjoy yourselves,
and, you know,

09:14.539 --> 09:16.275
this might be a tough night,
but we're gonna...

09:16.341 --> 09:19.043
we're here together
to support Benjamin,

09:19.111 --> 09:21.480
and, um, Ed and I
really appreciate it.

09:21.546 --> 09:22.947
Excuse me.

09:24.716 --> 09:25.650
Jeanette.

09:25.717 --> 09:26.651
Rick, hi.

09:26.718 --> 09:27.952
Wow.

09:28.019 --> 09:30.655
You look great.

09:30.722 --> 09:31.890
Thanks.

09:31.956 --> 09:33.758
Have you cut your hair
or something

09:33.825 --> 09:35.059
since I saw you last?

09:35.127 --> 09:37.329
- Probably, a couple of times.
- Hmm.

09:37.396 --> 09:38.930
I do it myself, even the back,

09:38.997 --> 09:41.433
- so it gets kind of tricky.
- All right.

09:41.500 --> 09:43.835
So there's refreshments
and hors d'oeurves,

09:43.902 --> 09:46.105
and if you'll excuse me,
I have to talk to Ed.

09:46.171 --> 09:47.306
Okay, yeah.

09:47.372 --> 09:48.640
I gotta use the bathroom.

09:48.707 --> 09:50.309
Okay.

09:50.375 --> 09:53.011
Hey, you.

09:53.078 --> 09:55.780
Hey, you.

09:55.847 --> 09:56.781
What do we have here?

09:56.848 --> 09:58.350
I printed up the brochure

09:58.417 --> 10:00.452
from the Youth Wilderness
Rehabilitation Center in Utah.

10:00.519 --> 10:02.194
It's supposed to be
the best in the country,

10:02.261 --> 10:04.396
but still, I wanted you
to have a look at it

10:04.463 --> 10:05.597
before I gave it a go.

10:06.765 --> 10:08.032
Wow.

10:09.334 --> 10:11.236
Uh, it says here

10:11.303 --> 10:13.638
he'll be taken from his bed
in the middle of the night

10:13.705 --> 10:16.208
with no idea where he's going
and whisked away,

10:16.275 --> 10:18.910
like he's some sort
of kidnap victim.

10:18.977 --> 10:21.113
Jeanette, this is all
feeling very extreme to me.

10:21.180 --> 10:23.215
Stop! That's enough!

10:23.282 --> 10:24.883
I want you to be quiet.

10:24.949 --> 10:28.553
We are trying to help him,
so you need to have a spine.

10:28.620 --> 10:29.988
Do you know what that is, Ed?

10:30.054 --> 10:33.057
For God sakes, grow a spine.

10:34.826 --> 10:36.395
How much time do we have?

10:36.461 --> 10:38.463
Well, if I go
and make the call,

10:38.530 --> 10:40.599
two uniformed men,
possibly in ski masks,

10:40.665 --> 10:41.900
will be standing by
until midnight.

10:41.966 --> 10:43.468
We need to do this
after the intervention.

10:43.535 --> 10:44.603
That's what they say.

10:44.669 --> 10:46.004
Ski masks?

10:49.040 --> 10:50.809
Okay, fine.

10:50.875 --> 10:52.111
Make the call.

10:52.177 --> 10:54.113
I know how hard
this is for you.

10:59.218 --> 11:00.819
Are you teasing me?

11:00.885 --> 11:02.627
Uh, no.

11:04.196 --> 11:05.530
That's too bad.

11:08.233 --> 11:09.434
Yeah, but, Jeanette...

11:10.502 --> 11:12.104
if he's okay, we... we can...

11:12.171 --> 11:13.505
we can just leave him alone,
right?

11:13.572 --> 11:15.940
I want him to be okay
just as much as you do,

11:16.007 --> 11:17.842
but we have to be certain,

11:17.909 --> 11:20.345
for when the hands
of that grandfather clock

11:20.412 --> 11:24.683
strike midnight,
they're coming for him.

11:34.559 --> 11:35.960
What am I doing?

12:05.597 --> 12:07.499
Come on, everybody.
Gather around.

12:07.566 --> 12:09.368
Come on in the living room.

12:09.434 --> 12:12.337
Come on. Let's go.

12:12.404 --> 12:14.073
Thank you so much for coming.

12:14.139 --> 12:15.707
Uh, Benjamin just got home.

12:15.774 --> 12:18.610
It is imperative
that Ed speaks to us now.

12:18.677 --> 12:19.611
Hurry up.

12:19.678 --> 12:22.247
Oh. Okay.

12:22.314 --> 12:25.184
Um, I, uh...

12:26.818 --> 12:28.287
Jeanette and I...

12:30.089 --> 12:31.356
Uh, could I...

12:34.226 --> 12:35.260
Thank you.

12:35.327 --> 12:37.162
I've asked you all to come here,

12:37.229 --> 12:41.966
because, uh, I have a situation
that I'm not familiar with,

12:42.033 --> 12:43.702
and I've never
dealt with it before,

12:43.768 --> 12:45.304
but according to Wikipedia,

12:45.370 --> 12:47.272
there's gonna be
a lot of lying,

12:47.339 --> 12:50.109
lot of cheating,
lot of back-stabbing,

12:50.175 --> 12:52.744
and a heaping bucket load
of deception,

12:52.811 --> 12:54.979
and it's all
typical addict behavior,

12:55.046 --> 12:56.248
so what I'm asking for...

12:56.315 --> 12:58.650
for all of you
is just to be on guard.

12:58.717 --> 13:01.760
Use your eyes and ears,
and come to me if you need to,

13:01.826 --> 13:03.328
every single one of you,
even you.

13:05.464 --> 13:07.832
I'm sorry.
I... I don't know you.

13:07.899 --> 13:08.867
Oh, I'm Ronny.

13:08.933 --> 13:10.569
He's with me, Mr. Thompson.

13:10.635 --> 13:12.104
Tom's my BFF.

13:14.239 --> 13:15.607
All right.

13:15.674 --> 13:17.342
Okay, then I'd like
to turn the reins over

13:17.409 --> 13:20.011
to my best friend, um,
who's gonna take over

13:20.079 --> 13:22.847
the intervention,
Dr. Ed Morris.

13:27.352 --> 13:28.287
Whoa, whoa.

13:28.353 --> 13:29.688
Okay, hold on. I need a...

13:29.754 --> 13:32.324
I need a 20-second
timeout here, Ed.

13:32.391 --> 13:34.759
- I'm sorry?
- I'm... I'm just a...

13:34.826 --> 13:36.961
I'm just a little taken back
by the request is all.

13:37.028 --> 13:38.663
I wasn't expecting
anything like that.

13:38.730 --> 13:41.733
Well, yeah, but it's obvious
that you're a doctor.

13:41.800 --> 13:43.702
You're the perfect one
to lead the intervention.

13:43.768 --> 13:44.969
I thought you'd understand.

13:45.036 --> 13:46.838
- And be honored.
- And be honored.

13:46.905 --> 13:50.509
I mean, I... I could really
use your expertise here, Ed.

13:50.575 --> 13:52.177
I'm an OB-GYN.

13:52.244 --> 13:53.478
Yes, but you're
still a doctor.

13:53.545 --> 13:55.347
You went to medical school.

13:55.414 --> 13:57.116
You know how to treat patients.

13:57.182 --> 13:59.284
I mean, am I... am I wrong here?

13:59.351 --> 14:01.293
No, he's right.

14:03.762 --> 14:04.729
Yes! Yes.

14:04.796 --> 14:06.198
You know what? I'll do it.

14:06.265 --> 14:07.366
I'll... I'll run
the intervention, okay?

14:08.933 --> 14:10.902
Thank you.
Let's hear it for Dr. Ed.

14:10.969 --> 14:12.371
Thank you so much.

14:17.809 --> 14:20.745
I always wondered
what "OB-GYN" stood for.

14:20.812 --> 14:25.016
Obstetrics-gynecology,
female reproductive health.

14:27.119 --> 14:29.554
That's what they say,
but I still wonder.

14:29.621 --> 14:31.923
Okay, everybody,
moving right along.

14:31.990 --> 14:33.858
I would, uh, like to ask

14:33.925 --> 14:37.896
my lovely girlfriend
and executive assistant

14:37.962 --> 14:41.066
to please go retrieve
Benjamin from his bedroom.

14:41.133 --> 14:43.068
You didn't have to mention
the assistant part.

14:43.135 --> 14:44.869
May I remind you
that when we have sex,

14:44.936 --> 14:47.606
we say, "I love you,"
to each other?

14:47.672 --> 14:52.077
Uh, that's a... that's a very
personal thing to be sharing.

14:52.144 --> 14:53.945
And also how you
cried on my shoulder

14:54.012 --> 14:55.947
for months
after Marley left you.

14:56.014 --> 14:58.517
You seduced me. You did.

14:58.583 --> 15:01.560
You lured me in,
because I was so vulnerable,

15:01.626 --> 15:03.262
and then you cast
your wicked spell.

15:04.829 --> 15:08.433
Unbelievable. Unbelievable.

15:11.870 --> 15:13.272
Jeanette, I'm s... I'm sorry.

15:13.338 --> 15:15.574
I... If I... If I could, uh...

15:15.640 --> 15:17.776
If Tom ever
called me his assistant,

15:17.842 --> 15:19.678
I'd cut off his balls.

15:21.146 --> 15:23.082
I would never do that.
You're my angel.

15:23.148 --> 15:24.149
I know, baby.

15:24.216 --> 15:25.317
Everybody, I'm... I'm sorry.

15:25.384 --> 15:27.086
I'm just gonna...

15:27.152 --> 15:28.653
I'm gonna go
get Benjamin myself.

15:28.720 --> 15:31.323
It's cool, bro. I got it.

15:31.390 --> 15:32.624
- Thank you, Rick.
- Uh-huh.

15:32.691 --> 15:33.792
- Thank you, Rick.
- Mm-hmm.

15:35.026 --> 15:37.662
Oh, and, Rick, good luck.

15:40.099 --> 15:41.333
Jeanette, I...

15:41.400 --> 15:42.501
No.

15:46.037 --> 15:47.506
Could I get a water?

15:47.572 --> 15:50.442
Roger, please,
this is not the time.

15:50.509 --> 15:51.610
We're getting Benjamin.

15:51.676 --> 15:54.446
His name is Ronny, Dad.

15:55.680 --> 15:57.982
Ronny, go ahead,
and get the water.

15:58.049 --> 15:59.418
But actually, you know what?

15:59.484 --> 16:01.526
Not the...
Not the bottled water, okay?

16:01.593 --> 16:02.994
The sink water.

16:14.606 --> 16:15.707
Hey.

16:20.379 --> 16:21.880
This is a damn fun game.

16:25.417 --> 16:28.653
These other guys
are complete noobs, huh?

16:31.623 --> 16:33.992
Ooh, that guy
did not need his guts.

16:34.058 --> 16:35.994
Yeah, you can't hear me.
That's cool.

16:41.466 --> 16:43.502
What the hell
is taking him so long?

16:43.568 --> 16:46.505
You know how uncles can be
when they get you alone.

16:49.374 --> 16:50.675
Heh. Sorry.

16:50.742 --> 16:52.677
- It was bad joke.
- No, baby, that was funny.

16:52.744 --> 16:54.313
- I'm sorry. Right?
- That was funny.

16:54.379 --> 16:56.348
No, dude, that shit was funny.
You're the shit, Tom.

16:56.415 --> 16:58.817
Come on! Focus now, guys.

16:58.883 --> 17:01.293
Focus up. You know, we gotta...

17:01.360 --> 17:03.228
stay on track here.

17:03.295 --> 17:05.564
Dr. Ed is right. If you guys
are gonna screw around,

17:05.630 --> 17:07.732
we're just gonna call off
this whole intervention thing.

17:07.799 --> 17:09.501
No, I'm sorry, Ed. We're good.

17:09.568 --> 17:11.336
We will go get him.

17:11.403 --> 17:14.673
Yes. We will go get him.

17:15.773 --> 17:17.076
Thank you.

17:24.782 --> 17:26.285
Hi!

17:26.351 --> 17:28.553
Come downstairs
with us now, okay?

17:28.620 --> 17:30.422
- Hey.
- Come downstairs with us now,

17:30.489 --> 17:32.056
- okay?
- Is everything all right?

17:32.124 --> 17:33.325
- We have a surprise.
- A surprise.

17:33.392 --> 17:34.426
Great.

17:37.596 --> 17:39.431
- Surprise!
- Surprise!

17:39.498 --> 17:41.800
Oh, Benjamin,
I'm sure you remember

17:41.866 --> 17:44.603
your Aunt Clarice
and Uncle Mitch.

17:44.669 --> 17:47.706
You met them, I believe, when
you were just a little baby.

17:49.474 --> 17:51.876
So, uh, thank you
for stopping your video game

17:51.943 --> 17:53.145
and coming out of your room.

17:53.212 --> 17:54.913
Just wanted
to bring you downstairs,

17:54.979 --> 17:57.282
'cause I was just having
some people over this afternoon

17:57.349 --> 18:00.385
and just wanted you
to come on down and say hi.

18:03.027 --> 18:04.396
Hi.

18:05.697 --> 18:07.432
So, uh, you know what?

18:07.499 --> 18:09.468
Uh, I... I know you were busy

18:09.534 --> 18:11.336
and you want
to get back to your game,

18:11.403 --> 18:13.938
but if you want,
you can, um, hang here.

18:14.005 --> 18:17.176
I'd love for you to just stay
in here with us and just hang.

18:17.242 --> 18:18.910
Could be totally chill,

18:18.977 --> 18:20.579
be cool.

18:20.645 --> 18:21.980
And we could all just, you know,

18:22.046 --> 18:24.416
have a nice little talk
and... and hang.

18:25.884 --> 18:27.986
Or... Or if you...
if you'd rather go back up

18:28.052 --> 18:31.256
and... and finish your game
and... and be in your room and...

18:31.323 --> 18:33.958
that'd be okay,
if that's what you want.

18:56.081 --> 18:57.382
I froze up.

18:57.449 --> 18:59.151
I couldn't do it.

18:59.218 --> 19:01.793
I don't know what came over me.
I panicked.

19:01.860 --> 19:05.664
You can do this,
and you don't have to be alone.

19:05.730 --> 19:07.132
We are all here for you.

19:07.199 --> 19:08.867
You are not alone.

19:10.034 --> 19:12.304
I'm not alone anymore, am I?

19:12.371 --> 19:13.938
No.

19:14.005 --> 19:16.208
- No.
- You're right, Jeanette.

19:16.275 --> 19:18.009
I can do this.

19:29.321 --> 19:30.755
Sorry, everybody.

19:30.822 --> 19:32.357
Just a little glitch
in the Matrix.

19:32.424 --> 19:34.326
Don't worry about it.
We are taking two.

19:34.393 --> 19:36.561
Take two.

19:36.628 --> 19:38.029
All right.
I'm gonna go get Benjamin,

19:38.097 --> 19:39.598
and I think
I'll bring him in here

19:39.664 --> 19:42.167
and then sit him right
in that cushy chair right there,

19:42.234 --> 19:43.835
and then we
can get this thing cooking.

19:43.902 --> 19:45.837
Uh, actually, Ed, I don't know

19:45.904 --> 19:47.272
if sitting him alone's
a good idea.

19:47.339 --> 19:49.374
Oh, alone is good.
We want to isolate.

19:49.441 --> 19:50.642
No, he should feel safe.

19:50.709 --> 19:52.444
He should be
on the couch with us.

19:52.511 --> 19:55.214
Uh, okay, perhaps...
perhaps he could sit alone.

19:55.280 --> 19:57.516
Maybe he could,
but hear me out.

19:57.582 --> 20:00.885
We could move this coffee table
from the center of the room

20:00.952 --> 20:03.128
to remove
any spatial barriers.

20:03.195 --> 20:04.829
I like that idea, Ed.

20:04.896 --> 20:06.131
Thank you.

20:06.198 --> 20:08.133
Tom, Robby,
you lift the table, please,

20:08.200 --> 20:09.901
and we'll take it
down this hallway.

20:09.968 --> 20:12.137
There's another room down there.
Just put it on in there,

20:12.204 --> 20:14.139
and I'm gonna go up
and get Benjamin. Okay.

20:14.206 --> 20:15.540
Lift with the legs, guys.

20:19.244 --> 20:21.513
So, what, you've done,
like, a ton of these?

20:21.580 --> 20:23.815
- Weren't you just here?
- When?

20:23.882 --> 20:25.684
When I said I was an OB-GYN.

20:25.750 --> 20:27.419
- Oh, right.
- Right.

20:27.486 --> 20:29.221
You ever get excited
looking at one of those?

20:29.288 --> 20:30.322
Nope. It's my work.

20:30.389 --> 20:31.656
Uh-huh.

20:31.723 --> 20:33.258
- You're a car salesman, right?
- Right.

20:33.325 --> 20:34.493
So that's like me asking you

20:34.559 --> 20:36.261
if you get turned on
looking at a car.

20:36.328 --> 20:37.896
I do, so I can only imagine.

20:37.962 --> 20:39.664
Well, in medicine,

20:39.731 --> 20:42.667
we learn to separate
human desire from the equation.

20:42.734 --> 20:44.369
Right.

20:44.436 --> 20:45.937
So what do you do for fun?

20:46.004 --> 20:47.939
You golf?

20:48.006 --> 20:50.275
Mountain bike? Jet Ski?

20:50.342 --> 20:51.376
Yeah, I golf.

20:51.443 --> 20:53.178
I do golf sometimes. Uh, I...

20:53.245 --> 20:58.717
I also sometimes like to put on
women's makeup and clothing.

20:58.783 --> 21:01.993
That, I find to be
very decompressing.

21:02.061 --> 21:03.195
Yeah, right.

21:12.304 --> 21:14.906
Whew. It's stuffy in here.

21:14.973 --> 21:16.808
You mean
like a can of sardines?

21:16.875 --> 21:20.044
You know, family is
the backbone of our culture.

21:20.112 --> 21:23.248
And social media
is the nervous system.

21:23.315 --> 21:25.784
Just try and say, "paella,"
without a smile.

21:25.850 --> 21:27.686
- Can't.
- You can't.

21:28.920 --> 21:30.355
I'll see you ladle.

21:31.456 --> 21:33.958
You're adorable.

21:38.397 --> 21:39.564
What the hell are you doing?

21:39.631 --> 21:40.932
Sorry.

21:40.999 --> 21:43.235
He just touched my leg.

21:43.302 --> 21:44.603
You sure?

21:44.669 --> 21:46.571
Yes, I'm sure.

21:46.638 --> 21:47.972
Is that true, Ronny?

21:49.074 --> 21:50.909
Uh, it was an accident.

21:50.975 --> 21:53.278
You're so damn glib, Ronny.

21:54.979 --> 21:56.415
Hmm.

22:00.252 --> 22:01.860
These two, huh?

22:01.926 --> 22:02.961
Huh?

22:03.027 --> 22:04.129
Lovebirds.

22:04.196 --> 22:05.664
Yeah, like rabbits.

22:05.730 --> 22:06.698
Right?

22:06.765 --> 22:07.799
Are you okay?

22:07.866 --> 22:10.034
Yeah, I guess.

22:10.102 --> 22:12.371
You seem a little tense.

22:12.437 --> 22:14.005
No, no, it's not like that.

22:14.073 --> 22:15.507
Oh, I know.

22:15.574 --> 22:18.143
I'm just a little raw.

22:18.210 --> 22:19.611
Sure. I understand.

22:19.678 --> 22:20.912
You do?

22:20.979 --> 22:21.846
Yeah.

22:27.352 --> 22:29.721
So, Benjamin, look.

22:29.788 --> 22:34.093
Everybody's here,
and, uh, look at that.

22:34.159 --> 22:36.761
You even got your own
cushy chair all ready for you.

22:36.828 --> 22:39.831
Somebody's put your name on it
on a name tag and everything.

22:39.898 --> 22:41.200
I did it.

22:41.266 --> 22:42.634
Great!

22:42.701 --> 22:43.735
Okay, everyone.

22:43.802 --> 22:46.037
Benjamin is here
for the surprise.

22:46.105 --> 22:47.639
You told him
it was a surprise?

22:47.706 --> 22:49.040
I didn't know
what else to say,

22:49.108 --> 22:50.542
so I just rolled with it.

22:50.609 --> 22:53.245
- That is so glib, Dad.
- I'm sorry?

22:53.312 --> 22:55.147
You're being even more glib
right now. Stop that.

22:55.214 --> 22:57.249
I'm not. I'm not glib.

22:57.316 --> 22:59.151
Nobody likes
a glib-assed liar, okay?

22:59.218 --> 23:01.160
There's enough dishonesty
in this family already.

23:02.961 --> 23:05.164
Well, you're right about that.

23:05.230 --> 23:07.299
All right. Okay, I'm sorry.

23:07.366 --> 23:09.434
I'm sorry. I'm sorry, okay?!

23:09.501 --> 23:11.002
Carry on.

23:11.070 --> 23:13.438
All right.
Um, everybody take a seat.

23:13.505 --> 23:14.706
Benjamin, sit.

23:15.774 --> 23:17.176
I'll go get a chair.

23:18.410 --> 23:19.911
All right.

23:19.978 --> 23:21.880
And, uh, let's all get settled.

23:23.248 --> 23:24.916
Mm-hmm, okay.

23:25.984 --> 23:27.419
Um...

23:28.487 --> 23:32.124
Benjamin, uh, this is...

23:33.458 --> 23:35.627
This is not a surprise

23:35.694 --> 23:38.230
in... in the traditional
sense of the word.

23:38.297 --> 23:40.432
It's not like the surprise
that I went through

23:40.499 --> 23:43.335
when I walked past your room
the other day

23:43.402 --> 23:45.737
and, uh, I smelled smoke.

23:50.809 --> 23:53.278
Were you smoking something
in there, Benjamin?

23:56.448 --> 23:57.416
Okay.

23:57.482 --> 23:59.751
This is, um...

23:59.818 --> 24:01.426
This is, uh, an event.

24:01.493 --> 24:02.994
It's a...

24:03.062 --> 24:04.763
It's an intervention,
Benjamin.

24:04.829 --> 24:06.731
We care about you.

24:06.798 --> 24:08.133
Because we love you.

24:08.200 --> 24:09.668
That's right.

24:10.969 --> 24:12.437
Yes.

24:12.504 --> 24:15.374
Because we all love you,

24:15.440 --> 24:19.278
and I don't know how bad
things are going right now,

24:19.344 --> 24:22.681
but I'm... I'm guessing
they're pretty far along.

24:31.055 --> 24:32.257
Uh, you know what?

24:32.324 --> 24:34.259
I'm gonna turn this over
to Dr. Ed,

24:34.326 --> 24:36.628
because now would be
a good time for all of us

24:36.695 --> 24:40.132
to have some of your expertise,
since you're the professional.

24:45.003 --> 24:46.138
Sorry.

25:13.905 --> 25:15.707
So...

25:15.774 --> 25:17.409
You have crumbs
on your face, man.

25:17.476 --> 25:18.877
- What's that?
- Crumbs on your face.

25:18.943 --> 25:19.944
Oh.

25:21.113 --> 25:22.214
Thank you.

25:37.462 --> 25:38.830
Hmm.

25:41.966 --> 25:43.668
That's part of the jacket.

25:48.940 --> 25:53.678
So, uh,
in a situation like this,

25:53.745 --> 25:56.581
I think it's best
if we went around the room

25:56.648 --> 25:59.884
and, uh, shared a little bit
of our own experience

25:59.951 --> 26:03.262
to, you know,
encourage honest dialogue.

26:03.328 --> 26:05.029
Uh, and since...

26:05.097 --> 26:06.565
I got this, Dr. Spock.

26:06.631 --> 26:09.301
All right, so my friends and I,
we would go through

26:09.368 --> 26:11.803
two, three tanks of nitrous
in a single weekend,

26:11.870 --> 26:14.439
frying brain cells
like they're eggs,

26:14.506 --> 26:16.208
balloon after balloon
after balloon.

26:16.275 --> 26:19.478
Pretty soon, you're seeing
starts, planetary alignments.

26:19.544 --> 26:21.646
I've never tried that.
Is it fun?

26:21.713 --> 26:23.082
- Amber!
- It's amazing.

26:23.148 --> 26:25.550
You gotta lean back
in, like, a pool chair.

26:25.617 --> 26:28.019
Yes, pool chair! What the hell
is it about a pool chair?

26:28.087 --> 26:29.221
Comfortable.

26:29.288 --> 26:31.390
Right! More comfortable.

26:32.691 --> 26:34.593
I'm not proud
of any of this, okay?

26:34.659 --> 26:35.927
I'm just trying to demonstrate

26:35.994 --> 26:38.663
what it looks like
when a man owns his shit.

26:40.165 --> 26:42.834
Ahem. Tom and I
used to huff paint thinner

26:42.901 --> 26:44.169
and, uh, battery acid

26:44.236 --> 26:46.238
out of a bucket
in my parents' garage.

26:46.305 --> 26:49.408
We did stuff like that
all the time.

26:49.474 --> 26:51.976
You never told me that, baby.

26:52.043 --> 26:54.846
I once snorted
a prescription drug.

26:54.913 --> 26:56.148
We both did.

26:56.215 --> 26:57.416
We traded for it.

26:57.482 --> 26:58.650
On Craigslist.

26:58.717 --> 27:01.160
Yes, we use Craigslist now.

27:01.226 --> 27:02.894
I don't like it.

27:02.961 --> 27:04.463
I do.

27:04.529 --> 27:05.864
Yes, she does,

27:05.930 --> 27:08.433
and it hurts my feelings.

27:08.500 --> 27:09.601
It shouldn't.

27:09.668 --> 27:12.971
I know, but still it does.

27:14.038 --> 27:15.274
I know what it's like

27:15.340 --> 27:17.309
to be with someone
who doesn't get you.

27:18.377 --> 27:19.878
Was that a dig?

27:19.944 --> 27:24.349
When I first met Tom,
he wouldn't even look at me.

27:24.416 --> 27:27.018
I thought he hated me.

27:27.086 --> 27:29.488
Think that's probably
why I liked him so much.

27:29.554 --> 27:32.824
That right there
is a tale as old as time.

27:32.891 --> 27:35.260
Even when
we were first dating,

27:35.327 --> 27:37.096
he would be such a dick,

27:37.162 --> 27:40.499
and then he would not text back
when he said he would,

27:40.565 --> 27:41.866
and I'd cry and cry,

27:41.933 --> 27:45.404
and one time,
I even cut myself a little bit.

27:45.470 --> 27:47.005
- Amber!
- Dad, don't worry.

27:47.072 --> 27:49.208
It was... I was so young then.

27:49.274 --> 27:51.710
You two have been together
for maybe a year.

27:51.776 --> 27:53.912
Exactly. I was only, like, 22.

27:53.978 --> 27:56.748
I didn't know myself
like I do at 23.

27:56.815 --> 27:59.584
I didn't know
that you did that.

27:59.651 --> 28:02.194
He's so perfect now,
though, Dad.

28:02.261 --> 28:05.530
I mean, he didn't even know that
I wanted him to text me back.

28:05.597 --> 28:10.569
It was just emojis,
very confusing ones,

28:10.635 --> 28:14.106
but now I know it was
just a self-defense mechanism

28:14.173 --> 28:16.575
to protect herself.

28:16.641 --> 28:19.711
Still, self-inflicted cutting
is not okay.

28:19.778 --> 28:21.080
I've done it.

28:22.247 --> 28:25.750
I cut myself the wrong way.

28:25.817 --> 28:27.586
Cry for help.

28:27.652 --> 28:29.921
It was a cry for help.

28:29.988 --> 28:31.890
I didn't do it.

28:31.956 --> 28:34.893
I've thought about doing it,
but I never did.

28:35.994 --> 28:37.196
Ahem.

28:37.262 --> 28:40.499
Uh, these are
very, very serious issues,

28:40.565 --> 28:44.469
very, very serious, and...

28:44.536 --> 28:47.339
But this is a circle of trust,
and I'm glad we could all share,

28:47.406 --> 28:48.607
so much so, that I'd like...

28:48.673 --> 28:50.375
I've cried
more tears this year

28:50.442 --> 28:52.377
than I have in my whole life.

28:52.444 --> 28:55.380
Yeah, I know.
I can't take it anymore.

28:55.447 --> 28:57.316
Your stress is stressing me.

28:57.382 --> 29:00.051
It's affecting me
in unusual ways.

29:13.938 --> 29:16.441
My job is not
an easy one to talk about.

29:18.243 --> 29:20.745
Uh, sometimes when people
ask me what I do for a living,

29:20.812 --> 29:22.347
I just, uh, make something up,

29:22.414 --> 29:24.949
tell 'em that I'm a garbageman
or a car salesman.

29:25.016 --> 29:27.686
Hey, Dr. Lady Parts,
I'm a car salesman.

29:27.752 --> 29:31.790
No, it's not easy
being a male OB-GYN.

29:31.856 --> 29:33.992
People look at you funny.
You know,

29:34.058 --> 29:37.796
sometimes they even think that
y-you're some kind of pervert.

29:37.862 --> 29:39.131
Pervert.

29:39.198 --> 29:41.533
And... And they tell jokes,
too, of course,

29:41.600 --> 29:44.035
and, yes, I have heard them all.

29:44.103 --> 29:46.138
What about the one
where the gynecologist...

29:46.205 --> 29:47.539
Enough!

29:49.074 --> 29:50.642
I said I heard 'em all,

29:50.709 --> 29:53.178
all of 'em,
every single one of 'em.

29:53.245 --> 29:56.148
The... The echo one, uh,

29:56.215 --> 29:57.449
the... the, uh, truck driver,

29:57.516 --> 30:00.285
the dozen
long-stemmed red roses,

30:00.352 --> 30:01.726
all of them.

30:06.865 --> 30:10.069
Every... Every vagina
that walks into my office

30:10.135 --> 30:11.970
is like a valuable piece of art,

30:12.036 --> 30:16.641
and... and sometimes I think of
myself as like a museum curator

30:16.708 --> 30:20.545
working hard to preserve
each priceless specimen.

30:20.612 --> 30:22.147
Because that's
what they are to me.

30:22.214 --> 30:23.382
As specimens?

30:23.448 --> 30:25.184
Canals of life.

30:25.250 --> 30:29.788
Uh, oh,
barometers of human existence.

30:29.854 --> 30:31.490
The vagina don't lie.

30:31.556 --> 30:32.957
Ho!

30:33.024 --> 30:34.259
You just said a mouthful.

30:34.326 --> 30:37.429
No. No, it does not.

30:37.496 --> 30:38.530
Vaginas are like, uh,

30:38.597 --> 30:41.533
the royal family
of human orifices.

30:41.600 --> 30:44.436
They... They rule
our every decision,

30:44.503 --> 30:48.207
and... and they work
in miraculous ways.

30:50.175 --> 30:56.515
So, you see, my job, my job
is of the utmost importance.

30:56.581 --> 30:58.850
You know,
it's... it's not a punch line.

31:00.452 --> 31:03.228
Have you ever seen,
like, a really huge pussy?

31:05.430 --> 31:07.066
Vagina.

31:07.132 --> 31:08.067
I have.

31:08.133 --> 31:09.968
I need a cigarette.

31:10.034 --> 31:11.370
I need a break, too.

31:11.436 --> 31:12.871
Okay. Guys, hey, why...

31:12.937 --> 31:14.373
- why don't we take a fiver?
- Yeah.

31:14.439 --> 31:16.408
And who needs a cigarette,
smoke a cigarette.

31:16.475 --> 31:19.411
I just want to thank
you all for being here.

31:26.085 --> 31:28.753
Especially you, Benjamin.

31:57.616 --> 31:59.184
Wow, that was
intense in there...

32:00.385 --> 32:02.427
wow, real eye-opener.

32:02.494 --> 32:03.795
Are you okay?

32:04.863 --> 32:06.431
Yeah. You?

32:06.498 --> 32:07.532
I'm cool.

32:07.599 --> 32:09.068
That's cool.

32:09.134 --> 32:11.936
Listen, I got
a little something for you.

32:12.003 --> 32:13.605
What?

32:17.842 --> 32:19.811
I just thought
I'd take the edge off a little.

32:24.283 --> 32:25.750
My stomach's been in knots.

32:25.817 --> 32:27.786
- Sure.
- I know it's not very ladylike.

32:27.852 --> 32:29.221
It was completely ladylike.

32:29.288 --> 32:30.889
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

32:33.825 --> 32:35.360
Was that you or me?

32:35.427 --> 32:37.596
That was definitely me.

32:40.499 --> 32:44.169
Well, every fireworks show
deserves a finale.

32:44.236 --> 32:45.470
Indeed.

32:50.542 --> 32:52.144
Give me that.

32:52.211 --> 32:53.945
Well, so that...
that went pretty well, I think.

32:54.012 --> 32:54.946
Yes, I believe it did.

32:55.013 --> 32:56.281
Yeah.

32:56.348 --> 32:57.782
It smells over here.

32:57.849 --> 32:59.418
- Does it?
- Boy, if that neighbor's dog

32:59.484 --> 33:01.626
dookied on my lawn again,
I'm gonna lose it.

33:01.693 --> 33:03.628
- Hmm.
- How do you two stand this?

33:06.531 --> 33:08.200
I didn't know I put you

33:08.267 --> 33:10.469
on such
an emotional roller coaster.

33:10.535 --> 33:12.604
- I know you didn't know, baby.
- It doesn't matter.

33:12.671 --> 33:15.540
I feel like I have
to prove my love to you.

33:15.607 --> 33:18.443
I'm gonna put a cut in my wrist,
little one.

33:18.510 --> 33:20.945
- You would do that for me?
- Of course I would, baby.

33:21.012 --> 33:22.981
- Oh, baby.
- I fricking love you.

33:23.047 --> 33:25.384
- I haven't had you in so long.
- Too long.

33:25.450 --> 33:26.651
Three hours.

33:26.718 --> 33:28.019
Wait. What?

33:28.087 --> 33:29.954
Since the last time
you guys had each other,

33:30.021 --> 33:31.890
it's been...
it's been about three hours.

33:31.956 --> 33:33.725
It was right before
we left your apartment.

33:33.792 --> 33:35.994
Amber, uh,
you had eight orgasms,

33:36.060 --> 33:38.197
and, Tom, you said it was
like starting a new universe.

33:38.263 --> 33:40.499
- You heard all that?
- No.

33:40.565 --> 33:41.866
You must have been spying.

33:41.933 --> 33:43.835
Mm-mm. No, I wasn't.

33:48.940 --> 33:49.974
I'm sorry.

33:51.543 --> 33:53.412
It's okay, Ronny.
You're my boy.

33:53.478 --> 33:55.680
Come on, baby.

33:55.747 --> 33:57.516
- Let's go up to my old room.
- Okay.

33:57.582 --> 33:58.917
We can play
the high school game.

33:58.983 --> 34:00.319
- I'm the sophomore.
- Okay.

34:00.385 --> 34:01.326
Okay.

34:03.762 --> 34:05.330
I miss you two when you leave.

34:10.001 --> 34:12.071
We used to give 'em hell,
Tom and I.

34:12.137 --> 34:13.405
Ah.

34:13.472 --> 34:15.574
We had quite the reputation.

34:15.639 --> 34:17.109
We had a nickname.

34:17.176 --> 34:19.543
It was, uh, Tron.

34:19.610 --> 34:22.380
Hah! T-Ron.

34:22.447 --> 34:24.349
'Cause, uh, his name's Tom,

34:24.416 --> 34:26.085
and my name's, uh, Ron.

34:26.150 --> 34:27.351
Yeah, I got it right away.

34:27.418 --> 34:28.387
- Yeah.
- Good one.

34:28.453 --> 34:30.255
Oh, boy.

34:44.369 --> 34:47.706
Ohh.

34:47.772 --> 34:50.574
It's been a while since I've
had to do something this brave.

34:50.641 --> 34:52.811
Since Boy Scouts, really.

34:58.049 --> 35:00.419
Or maybe it's like
the time when I was 16

35:00.485 --> 35:02.827
and my mother
gave birth in our home.

35:05.164 --> 35:07.499
But I hide my nerves,
then and now,

35:07.566 --> 35:09.834
'cause, you know, these guys,

35:09.901 --> 35:13.238
they sort of look at me
as the alpha male of the group,

35:13.305 --> 35:16.007
the wise elder sage,
or what have you.

35:17.342 --> 35:20.512
But I... I bear the burden.

35:21.780 --> 35:23.882
I shoulder the load.

35:33.192 --> 35:34.426
Hey.

35:37.196 --> 35:38.430
Look...

35:40.332 --> 35:42.767
I know things are messed up,

35:42.834 --> 35:44.669
but we're gonna
get through this.

35:48.540 --> 35:50.509
I'm sorry, Benjamin.

35:53.078 --> 35:55.013
You're in a lot of pain, Dad.

36:04.863 --> 36:05.964
Hey, Ed.

36:06.030 --> 36:08.200
Hi, Ed.

36:08.267 --> 36:10.402
Did you see him in there?

36:10.469 --> 36:11.836
It makes my skin crawl

36:11.903 --> 36:15.006
even trying
to make eye contact with him.

36:15.074 --> 36:16.975
My own son is being
thrown to the wolves,

36:17.041 --> 36:18.743
and I can't do a thing
to protect him.

36:18.810 --> 36:22.581
I... I think you need
to shift your frame, Ed.

36:22.647 --> 36:24.849
W-What do you mean, Ed?

36:24.916 --> 36:27.752
I'm not quite sure here,
but I... I imagine

36:27.819 --> 36:31.223
that this is all a bit myopic
for you at the moment,

36:31.290 --> 36:33.725
so perhaps if you pretend
you're somebody else.

36:33.792 --> 36:37.028
Somebody else?
But... But I'm just me, Ed,

36:37.096 --> 36:39.231
just stupid old me.

36:42.101 --> 36:45.237
Sorry, could you...
could give me a minute, Ed?

36:45.304 --> 36:47.439
Yeah. Yeah. I'll...

36:51.110 --> 36:53.545
Aren't you glad
we quit our jobs?

36:53.612 --> 36:55.046
I sure am.

36:55.114 --> 36:57.716
Not only
has it enabled us to travel,

36:57.782 --> 37:00.652
but it lets us
reconnect with family.

37:00.719 --> 37:01.826
Yeah.

37:01.893 --> 37:02.827
Look how pretty.

37:02.894 --> 37:03.828
Oh, pretty.

37:07.665 --> 37:09.101
Ta-da!

37:09.167 --> 37:11.969
It is I, Ed, the great Houdini.

37:12.036 --> 37:13.271
Ed, what are you doing?

37:13.338 --> 37:16.074
Everybody pick a card,
any card.

37:16.141 --> 37:17.075
Ed?

37:17.142 --> 37:18.276
Pick a card, any card.

37:18.343 --> 37:19.878
- Pick a card.
- Sit down.

37:19.944 --> 37:21.813
Pick a card, Timmy.

37:21.880 --> 37:24.649
Come on. Sit down!

37:25.884 --> 37:27.586
But you told me
to be someone else.

37:27.652 --> 37:29.388
Well, not like that.
That's not what I meant.

37:29.454 --> 37:30.655
Will you sit down?

37:36.261 --> 37:37.862
Now that we've all shared,

37:37.929 --> 37:40.299
I think it's time
to, uh, move on

37:40.365 --> 37:41.500
to the pressing issue at hand.

37:41.566 --> 37:43.168
I wonder what
those two were up to.

37:44.636 --> 37:46.171
Afternoon delight.

37:46.238 --> 37:47.806
Welcome back, you two.

37:47.872 --> 37:49.941
Amber was just showing me
her old room.

37:50.008 --> 37:52.177
That is a nice jacket,
Mr. Thompson.

37:52.244 --> 37:53.778
Did you get that
at a vintage store?

37:59.651 --> 38:00.985
What is he doing?

38:01.052 --> 38:02.861
He's like
some sort of a lap dog.

38:04.396 --> 38:05.797
It's okay, Ronny.

38:07.432 --> 38:08.967
I don't do drugs.

38:09.033 --> 38:11.070
I'm sorry.
What was that, Benjamin?

38:12.537 --> 38:13.805
What was that?

38:13.872 --> 38:15.140
Sounded like your doorbell.

38:15.207 --> 38:17.309
Oh, my.
Oh, it's not midnight.

38:17.376 --> 38:19.644
Oh, my God. It might be Marley.

38:19.711 --> 38:22.214
- You invited Mom?
- Well, I Facebooked her,

38:22.281 --> 38:24.216
but she didn't respond,
so I didn't think she'd show.

38:24.283 --> 38:25.817
Tell her
she's not welcome here.

38:25.884 --> 38:27.152
Oh, my God.

38:27.219 --> 38:30.555
I can't move my legs.
I... I... Somebody...

38:30.622 --> 38:32.491
Somebody has to go to the door
and get her.

38:32.557 --> 38:33.992
I can't let her leave again.

38:34.058 --> 38:34.993
Mr. Thompson, are you okay?

38:35.059 --> 38:36.828
We'll look for you!

38:36.895 --> 38:38.963
My arms,
I have no feeling in my arms.

38:39.030 --> 38:41.333
Ed, calm down.

38:41.400 --> 38:42.534
My chest hurts.

38:44.936 --> 38:46.738
Dad, you look like you're
having a panic attack.

38:46.805 --> 38:48.073
I have those all the time.

38:48.140 --> 38:52.344
I am.
I-I'm having a panic attack.

38:52.411 --> 38:53.645
Breathe, Ed. Breathe.

38:53.712 --> 38:54.713
Let's take off this jacket.

38:54.779 --> 38:55.714
Okay.

38:56.881 --> 38:58.683
Oh, okay.

39:00.252 --> 39:02.361
Ooh, it's yummy pizza!

39:02.427 --> 39:04.229
Oh, I forgot!
I wanted to surprise everyone.

39:04.296 --> 39:06.665
I ordered a couple of pies.
I'm so sorry. I'll get it.

39:11.170 --> 39:12.137
Pizza.

39:12.204 --> 39:13.905
Everybody likes pizza.

39:13.972 --> 39:15.907
How you like this job, huh?

39:15.974 --> 39:18.743
Look at this. Bring pizza.
People give you money.

39:18.810 --> 39:21.080
Take the rest of the minute off,
will you?

39:21.146 --> 39:22.614
Mmm.

39:22.681 --> 39:23.682
Pizza! Who wants pizza?!

39:23.748 --> 39:25.084
Hey, look at the two pies, yeah.

39:25.150 --> 39:26.651
Yeah!

39:26.718 --> 39:28.087
- That smells ♪ heavenly ♪
- That's right.

39:28.153 --> 39:30.189
That's right.

39:30.255 --> 39:32.557
Get in here.
Come on. It's hot.

39:32.624 --> 39:34.193
Really good.

39:34.259 --> 39:36.361
This is
some awesome-ass pizza.

39:36.428 --> 39:37.629
Come on, people.

39:37.696 --> 39:39.131
- Thank you, Uncle Rick.
- Please.

39:39.198 --> 39:40.799
- Dude, this is so good.
- This pizza's amazing.

39:40.865 --> 39:42.634
This was a great idea, Rick.

39:42.701 --> 39:43.868
- Not bad.
- Yes, thank you, Rick.

39:43.935 --> 39:45.104
None of this is great.

39:45.170 --> 39:46.138
What's the matter, bro?

39:46.205 --> 39:47.339
Nothing is great.

39:47.406 --> 39:49.608
She didn't show.

39:49.674 --> 39:51.643
She never showed.

39:51.710 --> 39:53.945
- Bro, what's up?
- None of this is great.

39:54.012 --> 39:57.716
- Okay. Have a slice of pizza.
- I don't want any pizza.

39:57.782 --> 39:59.718
Come on, Mr. Thompson.
This is some really good pizza.

39:59.784 --> 40:01.993
I don't want a goddamn
slice of pizza, okay?

40:05.064 --> 40:06.831
I'm sorry.

40:06.898 --> 40:08.367
I'm sorry, Reginald.

40:08.433 --> 40:09.368
It's Ronny.

40:09.434 --> 40:11.170
I'm sorry, everybody.

40:11.236 --> 40:13.938
I'm... I'm falling apart.

40:14.005 --> 40:16.075
I just had a panic attack.

40:16.141 --> 40:20.179
Yeah, but, uh,
it wasn't even Mom at the door.

40:20.245 --> 40:23.815
I mean, you had a panic attack
'cause of the pizza guy.

40:26.785 --> 40:29.288
Come on.
You have to admit that's funny.

40:29.354 --> 40:31.556
It's not funny, Ed.

40:31.623 --> 40:33.958
Is it funny that I
want my wife to come home

40:34.025 --> 40:37.196
and take some accountability
for this family?

40:37.262 --> 40:40.432
Is it funny that I'm...
I'm scared to death,

40:40.499 --> 40:42.367
that the idea of her
coming through the door

40:42.434 --> 40:43.768
fills me with sheer terror?

40:43.835 --> 40:45.370
Mr. Thompson, it was

40:45.437 --> 40:47.872
just-a the pizza guy, man.

40:49.141 --> 40:51.143
It's not funny!
None of this is.

40:51.210 --> 40:52.877
Is she funny?

40:52.944 --> 40:54.413
What's that supposed to mean?

40:54.479 --> 40:56.515
Is a panic attack funny?

40:56.581 --> 40:57.782
Is he funny?

40:59.318 --> 41:01.426
Wish I could be like her,

41:01.493 --> 41:04.329
just free,
doing whatever she wants,

41:04.396 --> 41:08.600
and me, I'm stuck here
in a relationship and a job...

41:08.667 --> 41:10.735
- That's nice.
- and a mortgage,

41:10.802 --> 41:12.971
and she just did
whatever she wanted,

41:13.037 --> 41:14.406
just a free spirit.

41:14.473 --> 41:16.441
I wish I could be like her.

41:17.809 --> 41:19.578
I wish I could just quit.

41:19.644 --> 41:21.113
Okay, new plan.

41:21.180 --> 41:23.382
Come work with me
at the dealership.

41:23.448 --> 41:25.184
I don't want to work with you.

41:25.250 --> 41:28.620
I want to do
something freestyle.

41:28.687 --> 41:31.156
I wanna be a fisherman
or... or a shepherd,

41:31.223 --> 41:33.592
anything with animals.
I don't care.

41:33.658 --> 41:35.594
Crap! Shit! Piss!

41:35.660 --> 41:36.695
Hey, mister.

41:38.697 --> 41:41.500
What do you say you take it easy
with that language?

41:41.566 --> 41:43.502
Hey, screw you, Mitch.

41:43.568 --> 41:45.036
It's your first cousin

41:45.104 --> 41:47.005
that started this whole mess
in the first place.

41:47.072 --> 41:48.507
Take it easy, buddy.

41:48.573 --> 41:49.674
I don't need your "buddy,"

41:49.741 --> 41:51.343
and I'm sick
of you and your wife

41:51.410 --> 41:54.613
just gallivanting around here
like you have all these years.

41:54.679 --> 41:58.450
I don't care how many mice
you traded for houses

41:58.517 --> 42:00.452
or how great
your credit rating is.

42:00.519 --> 42:01.826
I just don't give a shit.

42:01.893 --> 42:03.662
You're not helping
this situation at all.

42:03.728 --> 42:05.830
Mince your words, cowboy.

42:10.969 --> 42:13.538
Why are you
looking at me like that?

42:14.939 --> 42:15.874
Like what?

42:17.242 --> 42:19.178
I've seen that look before,

42:19.244 --> 42:23.415
back in the eighties,
in a sports bar.

42:23.482 --> 42:25.850
You want to fight me, don't you?

42:28.420 --> 42:29.588
I'll fight you.

42:29.654 --> 42:30.689
Oh, you will?

42:30.755 --> 42:32.224
Oh, Mr. Big Man,
you wanna fight?

42:32.291 --> 42:33.358
- Mm.
- Okay, let's fight.

42:33.425 --> 42:34.626
Let's throw this down.

42:34.693 --> 42:36.361
Dad, stop it!
You're acting crazy!

42:36.428 --> 42:39.264
No! Let 'em fight.

42:39.331 --> 42:40.899
Come on. Come on, baby.

42:40.965 --> 42:42.334
- Oh! Oh!
- Baby.

42:42.401 --> 42:43.902
- You little baby.
- Ow.

42:43.968 --> 42:45.770
Oh, your hands
are clammy like a girl.

42:45.837 --> 42:47.706
- Dad.
- Put the left up.

42:47.772 --> 42:49.908
Ah!

42:49.974 --> 42:52.611
I'm sorry, baby.
I don't do well with violence.

42:52.677 --> 42:55.614
- I'll be back. Be right back.
- Ow! Ow!

42:55.680 --> 42:57.582
Is that how you fight
in Nebraska?

42:57.649 --> 42:59.218
He doesn't do well
with violence.

42:59.284 --> 43:01.025
Don't take that.

43:02.094 --> 43:04.028
- Huh?
- Mm.

43:04.096 --> 43:05.230
- Hey.
- Thanks, hon.

43:05.297 --> 43:07.499
All right, here we go.
All right.

43:07.566 --> 43:09.234
- Dad.
- You fight like a girl.

43:09.301 --> 43:10.569
That's it.

43:10.635 --> 43:11.836
You got no guts.

43:11.903 --> 43:12.804
No!

43:15.874 --> 43:19.043
That statue of David
is an ancient family heirloom.

43:20.345 --> 43:21.413
Ohh!

43:25.784 --> 43:27.719
Come on.
No, no, no, no, no, no, no!

43:27.786 --> 43:28.720
Oh!

43:29.821 --> 43:32.056
Look out.

43:32.124 --> 43:33.992
Ahh! Okay.

43:34.058 --> 43:35.594
I tap out. I tap out.

43:35.660 --> 43:36.728
Okay.

43:40.632 --> 43:42.801
He fought well,

43:42.867 --> 43:45.237
but I just brought
a little extra today.

43:48.740 --> 43:49.941
Dad...

43:51.643 --> 43:52.811
are you okay?

43:52.877 --> 43:54.579
It's my arm, honey.

43:54.646 --> 43:56.014
It's not good.

43:57.149 --> 43:58.950
I gotta go find Tom.

43:59.017 --> 44:01.860
Okay.
Why don't we take a fiver,

44:01.926 --> 44:03.595
cigarette break, huh?

44:03.662 --> 44:05.264
I think you deserve it.

44:19.911 --> 44:21.680
Please stay.

44:21.746 --> 44:23.682
"Stuck in a relationship."

44:23.748 --> 44:24.949
I'll admit it. You're right.

44:25.016 --> 44:26.651
I felt stuck, too.

44:26.718 --> 44:28.320
Please stay?

44:28.387 --> 44:31.223
I'll stay tonight for Ben,
not for you.

44:31.290 --> 44:33.392
I'm done trying to fix you, Ed.

44:40.365 --> 44:41.500
Hey, Mitch...

44:42.701 --> 44:44.236
nice arm bar.

44:44.303 --> 44:47.706
- Thank you, Ed.
- Where'd you learn that?

44:47.772 --> 44:51.343
Clarice and I take
a jujitsu class at the "Y."

44:51.410 --> 44:53.712
I figured you had training.

44:53.778 --> 44:57.216
Your technique was spot on.

44:57.282 --> 44:59.684
So, uh, no hard feelings, right?

44:59.751 --> 45:00.885
Oh, no, Ed.

45:00.952 --> 45:04.729
No hard feelings,
only hard lessons.

45:05.997 --> 45:07.199
Touché.

45:10.269 --> 45:11.636
You all right?

45:11.703 --> 45:14.873
Yeah, I'm...
I'm hanging in there, pal.

45:14.939 --> 45:16.108
Hmm.

45:16.175 --> 45:17.909
Can I ask you a question?

45:17.976 --> 45:19.178
Shoot.

45:19.244 --> 45:21.513
When did
everything go wrong for me?

45:21.580 --> 45:24.683
Well, I think it was
when your wife left you, no?

45:25.850 --> 45:27.686
I don't know.

45:27.752 --> 45:30.255
I think it was way before that.

45:30.322 --> 45:32.691
Yeah, probably. Who knows?

45:32.757 --> 45:36.060
But, you know, it's never
too late to redeem yourself.

45:38.197 --> 45:42.567
Time's gonna come
when the world needs a hero,

45:42.634 --> 45:45.404
and you gotta be ready
to answer that call.

45:47.672 --> 45:51.310
Now, come on. You owe
these folks a big apology, huh?

45:51.376 --> 45:52.577
Yeah.

45:52.644 --> 45:53.712
Oh, yeah, yeah.

45:53.778 --> 45:55.114
Big one.

45:57.048 --> 45:58.417
- Thanks, Ed.
- Yeah, I know. Come on.

45:58.483 --> 46:00.085
Go. Go. Apologize.

46:05.364 --> 46:09.468
Look, everyone, I'm sorry.

46:09.534 --> 46:11.736
I know I have some issues,

46:11.803 --> 46:14.773
and you all have been
super supportive of them,

46:14.839 --> 46:16.941
and I think it's time that I...

46:17.008 --> 46:19.144
He's gone.
He didn't even have the nerve

46:19.211 --> 46:21.513
to tell me to my face.
He texted me.

46:21.580 --> 46:22.947
This is all your fault.

46:23.014 --> 46:25.184
What did he say?

46:25.250 --> 46:26.485
"I feel triggered.

46:26.551 --> 46:28.120
I can't take the drama.
I just..."

46:28.187 --> 46:31.623
"I just have to take ownership
of myself for a while."

46:31.690 --> 46:32.991
- What?
- Yeah.

46:33.057 --> 46:35.026
He's done this before,

46:35.094 --> 46:38.029
enough times that it's safe
to say he isn't coming back.

46:38.097 --> 46:40.599
He can't be owned. Heh.

46:40.665 --> 46:43.268
As much as any of us
might want to own him

46:43.335 --> 46:47.806
with all of our might,
Tom is the CEO of Tom.

46:47.872 --> 46:49.341
He always used to say that.

46:49.408 --> 46:51.543
But I didn't do anything.

46:51.610 --> 46:53.745
I love him. I mean...

46:53.812 --> 46:59.884
Sometimes we can love the one,
but he is unable...

46:59.951 --> 47:04.596
...to contain that love
inside their own self...

47:04.663 --> 47:07.199
...mm,
because of the wounds.

47:07.266 --> 47:12.637
Yes, because the wounds
don't leave room.

47:12.704 --> 47:13.672
Mm-mm.

47:13.738 --> 47:15.540
You know what?

47:15.607 --> 47:19.178
I love him
just as much as you did.

47:19.244 --> 47:21.546
And you know what else?
I'm just gonna say it.

47:21.613 --> 47:23.682
I'm in love with you,
too, Amber.

47:23.748 --> 47:25.850
I've always loved you.

47:25.917 --> 47:27.552
I love both of you.

47:27.619 --> 47:29.854
I loved what the two of you
were together.

47:29.921 --> 47:32.091
I loved what... I don't know...

47:32.157 --> 47:35.026
maybe what the three of us
could have been together

47:35.094 --> 47:38.430
if... if it was a perfect world,
if we had just had the time,

47:38.497 --> 47:41.600
if I had just said something
when I had the chance.

47:41.666 --> 47:43.034
But...

47:45.504 --> 47:48.773
I don't know. Maybe now...

47:51.510 --> 47:55.547
Maybe now it could...
it could just be us,

47:55.614 --> 47:57.616
just you and me.

47:57.682 --> 47:59.084
What do you say?

48:00.785 --> 48:02.727
What?

48:02.794 --> 48:03.728
Eww.

48:03.795 --> 48:05.464
No! I hate this!

48:05.530 --> 48:06.898
Oh, my God.

48:06.965 --> 48:08.767
Yeah. No, I... That's...

48:08.833 --> 48:11.570
I was just sharing my feelings.

48:11.636 --> 48:13.305
I hate feelings!

48:13.372 --> 48:15.140
This is bullshit!

48:15.207 --> 48:17.242
You are bullshit!

48:17.309 --> 48:18.610
Amber, wait!

48:18.677 --> 48:21.313
This is all my fault.
Amber! Wait!

48:21.380 --> 48:23.215
Amber, come back.

48:33.192 --> 48:35.227
Hey, Benjamin.

48:39.664 --> 48:41.766
Are you all right, Benjamin?

48:44.103 --> 48:46.838
I know this is confronting.

48:46.905 --> 48:49.308
Believe me, I know.

48:51.543 --> 48:54.479
My father was a military man.

48:54.546 --> 48:57.582
He was stern and distant.

48:57.649 --> 49:00.519
He was so distant that he
went to a base in Germany

49:00.585 --> 49:02.461
when I was 15,
and he never came home.

49:04.896 --> 49:06.798
Can I get you
a sugar-free lemonade?

49:08.233 --> 49:09.201
Okay.

49:18.777 --> 49:20.879
You don't talk much, do you?

49:22.847 --> 49:24.883
It's all right.
I completely understand.

49:32.724 --> 49:35.059
By the way,
I'm on your side, Benjamin.

49:35.127 --> 49:37.662
I'm not gonna say nothing
to nobody. I promise.

49:38.797 --> 49:40.332
Hey, do you know
I gave your mother

49:40.399 --> 49:42.000
her first ultrasound with you?

49:42.067 --> 49:45.137
Heh. I determined your sex.

49:45.204 --> 49:49.608
I was the first person
to see you into this world.

49:49.674 --> 49:55.046
So, I mean,
you can trust me, Benjamin.

49:55.114 --> 49:58.217
Shoot, I got problems
just like everybody else.

49:58.283 --> 50:00.959
I'm a doctor, and I'm lost.

50:02.227 --> 50:05.764
A doctor, and I'm so, so lost.

50:06.931 --> 50:08.433
I'm a liar.

50:09.501 --> 50:10.935
I'm a liar.

50:12.003 --> 50:13.037
You know what?

50:13.105 --> 50:15.039
I'm just gonna be real with you,

50:15.107 --> 50:17.676
not gonna tiptoe around this.
You deserve to know.

50:17.742 --> 50:21.813
Sometimes I like to dress...

50:28.087 --> 50:29.053
Never mind.

50:38.230 --> 50:39.464
Are you happy, Rick?

50:39.531 --> 50:42.033
No. You?

50:43.135 --> 50:45.537
No. No.

50:47.239 --> 50:48.640
You know, my girls,
my two daughters,

50:48.707 --> 50:51.210
they, uh, ice-skate
at a very competitive level,

50:51.276 --> 50:52.844
so they're doing that
all the time,

50:52.911 --> 50:55.046
and their mom is with them,
and they've ghosted me,

50:55.114 --> 50:56.848
because apparently
I make them nervous.

50:56.915 --> 50:58.550
Nervous?

50:58.617 --> 51:00.819
Yeah. I yell at the judges,
'cause their scoring system

51:00.885 --> 51:02.761
is completely ludicrous
and made up.

51:02.827 --> 51:04.629
What about your wife?

51:06.098 --> 51:09.234
She's cheating on me
with their instructor.

51:10.635 --> 51:12.871
He's a former
Olympic skater champion.

51:12.937 --> 51:15.707
I don't want to say who it is.

51:15.774 --> 51:18.510
If you were to watch
the '88 games from Calgary,

51:18.577 --> 51:20.345
you would be
on the right track.

51:21.680 --> 51:23.382
She doesn't know that I know,

51:23.448 --> 51:26.651
but truth is
it's best that she's moved on.

51:28.353 --> 51:31.823
Well, you know,
Olympian or not,

51:31.890 --> 51:34.793
that figure skater isn't
half the man that you are.

51:36.295 --> 51:37.962
You're an alpha male.

51:38.029 --> 51:40.299
You could kick his ass
if you wanted to.

51:40.365 --> 51:41.400
I really could.

51:41.466 --> 51:42.767
I try not to get angry

51:42.834 --> 51:44.636
unless it's
completely necessary, though.

51:44.703 --> 51:47.906
Takes an awful lot
to drag out the war cannons.

51:47.972 --> 51:49.141
I'll bet.

51:49.208 --> 51:50.142
Whoa.

51:50.209 --> 51:51.210
Surprising.

51:51.276 --> 51:52.311
I'm not surprised.

51:56.148 --> 51:57.449
I'm horny.

51:57.516 --> 51:58.750

There he is.

53:57.082 --> 53:58.383
Heh.

54:49.941 --> 54:53.945
Bred and cultivated
in a sickly soil of dysfunction,

54:54.012 --> 54:55.414
I do my part.

54:57.349 --> 54:59.351
And it's
a real shit-show in there,

54:59.418 --> 55:01.620
but the world is no different.

55:01.686 --> 55:06.131
We're all subject to winds
and tides and ash and fog.

55:08.032 --> 55:09.634
And if I've gone
off the deep end,

55:09.701 --> 55:12.304
it's only because the night
beckons some sort of fire

55:12.371 --> 55:14.773
illuminating
the burning knowledge of self...

55:16.241 --> 55:19.778
of existing within a prism
of my own creation.

56:11.836 --> 56:13.505
Come out of there!

56:13.572 --> 56:15.707
Nothing's gonna get settled
with you locked in your room.

56:15.774 --> 56:17.409
No! you've done enough, okay?

56:17.476 --> 56:19.010
Can I just have a moment?

56:19.078 --> 56:20.912
I'm sorry, Amber.
I didn't mean to alarm you.

56:20.979 --> 56:22.914
I just... I thought
it could be a really good idea

56:22.981 --> 56:24.416
if we were together.

56:24.483 --> 56:26.718
Well, you couldn't
have picked a worse time.

56:26.785 --> 56:28.052
Doesn't matter, Roman.

56:28.120 --> 56:29.488
She's only gonna
break your heart anyway.

56:29.554 --> 56:31.556
Shut up, Dad! I heard that!

56:31.623 --> 56:33.458
I know. I only said it
so you could hear,

56:33.525 --> 56:35.360
'cause I know what you're
going through, honey!

56:35.427 --> 56:37.028
Come out of there, please!

56:37.096 --> 56:39.731
Wait. I get it now.

56:39.798 --> 56:42.467
I need to do what Tom never did.

56:42.534 --> 56:43.968
I'm gonna cut myself

56:44.035 --> 56:46.805
to prove to you
that this is the real deal!

56:47.972 --> 56:49.108
Hey, wait! That's my bedroom!

56:49.174 --> 56:50.542
You can't go in there!

56:50.609 --> 56:51.676
Excuse me.

56:52.944 --> 56:54.546
Ronny, stop!

56:56.548 --> 56:57.482
Jesus!

56:58.550 --> 57:00.085
- Hey there.
- Oh, hey, man.

57:05.397 --> 57:06.598
We won't talk...

57:06.665 --> 57:08.433
...without an attorney.

57:08.500 --> 57:11.670
Okay. Everybody
in the living room right now.

57:13.305 --> 57:14.773
- No!
- What?

57:14.839 --> 57:16.808
You heard her. She said, "No."

57:16.875 --> 57:19.344
I know what she said, Rick,
you pernicious skirt chaser.

57:19.411 --> 57:21.146
For God sakes,
you have a wife and kids!

57:21.213 --> 57:22.414
Who hate me.

57:22.481 --> 57:23.948
Just like you hate me, Amber.

57:24.015 --> 57:25.150
I don't hate you, Ronny.

57:25.217 --> 57:26.751
I just don't
want to be with you.

57:26.818 --> 57:29.188
Yep, yes.
You said that. I hear you.

57:29.254 --> 57:31.290
You're entitled to that,
and I accept it.

57:31.356 --> 57:34.659
Wow, that is
a lot of porno, Mr. Thompson.

57:35.760 --> 57:37.162
It's not mine.

57:37.229 --> 57:38.863
- It was my wife's.
- That's disgusting.

57:38.930 --> 57:41.032
No, that's true.
He told me that a long time ago.

57:41.100 --> 57:42.033
Your mom loved porno.

57:46.205 --> 57:47.372
What?

57:49.241 --> 57:52.444
Where are you going?
You're stealing from me?

57:52.511 --> 57:54.279
I mean, haven't you
already done enough?

57:54.346 --> 57:56.281
I mean, you twisted
the shit out of my arm.

57:56.348 --> 57:57.282
I should press charges.

57:57.349 --> 57:58.317
Please don't.

57:58.383 --> 57:59.818
We just want another house.

57:59.884 --> 58:01.826
Well, petty thievery
is not the way to get one.

58:01.893 --> 58:03.995
We promise
not to do it again to you.

58:04.063 --> 58:05.830
You shouldn't do it to anyone.

58:05.897 --> 58:07.866
Now, you're just
being unreasonable.

58:07.932 --> 58:11.736
My God, why is this happening?

58:11.803 --> 58:14.206
You're all hurting me so much!

58:14.273 --> 58:15.740
Shut up already, Ed.

58:15.807 --> 58:18.009
You're so self-centered.

58:18.077 --> 58:19.878
You think everyone else's
problems are about you.

58:19.944 --> 58:21.246
Well, they're not.

58:21.313 --> 58:23.482
This night was supposed
to be about Benjamin.

58:23.548 --> 58:24.649
Benjamin.

58:25.984 --> 58:27.419
Where's Benjamin?

58:31.623 --> 58:32.891
Benjamin!

58:32.957 --> 58:34.559
He's in some kind
of drug coma.

58:34.626 --> 58:36.027
I'm gonna call 911.

58:36.095 --> 58:37.596
- Oh, my God.
- Out of my way, please.

58:37.662 --> 58:38.663
Excuse me.

58:53.478 --> 58:54.746
He's dead.

58:58.283 --> 59:02.694
Benjamin? If you can hear us,
try and wiggle your toes.

59:04.329 --> 59:06.398
Why did you say he was dead?

59:06.465 --> 59:08.867
I... I don't... I meant
to say he was knocked out.

59:08.933 --> 59:10.735
I don't know.
I mixed up my words.

59:10.802 --> 59:12.571
I'm usually way more thorough
in my examinations.

59:12.637 --> 59:13.705
It's just that today,

59:13.772 --> 59:15.640
the pressure
has been unbearable.

59:15.707 --> 59:16.841
- Your arms.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

59:16.908 --> 59:18.277
Take it easy.
Take it easy, Benjamin.

59:18.343 --> 59:19.344
I'm sorry. Who are you?

59:19.411 --> 59:20.745
Oh, I'm a doctor, Dr. Ed.

59:20.812 --> 59:22.647
He is... He is a doctor.

59:24.649 --> 59:27.619
Oh, I do this sometimes.

59:27.686 --> 59:29.454
Okay. Uh, Benjamin,

59:29.521 --> 59:32.291
uh, against my better judgment,
I'm gonna leave you here,

59:32.357 --> 59:34.759
but if you feel lightheaded
or dizzy at any time,

59:34.826 --> 59:36.961
be sure to, uh,
tell the good doctor

59:37.028 --> 59:38.763
or any of your relatives,
and they'll take you

59:38.830 --> 59:41.400
to the hospital
immediately, okay?

59:41.466 --> 59:42.734
All right, up you go.

59:42.801 --> 59:43.835
Upsy-daisy!

59:43.902 --> 59:45.404
Up you go.

59:45.470 --> 59:46.805
Thank you so much.

59:46.871 --> 59:48.640
Okay.

01:00:14.806 --> 01:00:17.542
I'm glad you're okay, Benjamin.

01:00:17.609 --> 01:00:19.878
I'm most certainly glad,

01:00:19.944 --> 01:00:21.413
but make no mistake.

01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:24.416
These matters
are very, very serious.

01:00:24.483 --> 01:00:26.551
You've been doing drugs
in our home.

01:00:26.618 --> 01:00:30.822
I thought it was crystal meth,
but how wrong I was.

01:00:30.889 --> 01:00:32.657
It's worse.

01:00:32.724 --> 01:00:34.493
It's marijuana.

01:00:34.559 --> 01:00:36.561
Marijuana,

01:00:36.628 --> 01:00:39.964
the most condemned street drug
Mexico has to offer.

01:00:40.031 --> 01:00:42.401
This is worse than any of us
could have imagined,

01:00:42.467 --> 01:00:44.403
but I know you need my help now.

01:00:44.469 --> 01:00:45.770
Just smoke
a little weed, right?

01:00:45.837 --> 01:00:47.239
What was that?

01:00:47.306 --> 01:00:49.741
I said he's just
smoking a little weed.

01:00:49.808 --> 01:00:52.244
Just a little weed?

01:00:52.311 --> 01:00:53.778
Just a little weed?

01:00:53.845 --> 01:00:55.614
That's like saying
"The Old Man and the Sea"

01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:57.282
is just a little novel

01:00:57.349 --> 01:00:59.017
or that possession of narcotics

01:00:59.084 --> 01:01:00.985
will get you
just a little prison time.

01:01:01.052 --> 01:01:02.294
No biggie, right?

01:01:02.361 --> 01:01:05.164
Do you know that weed
is a gateway drug?

01:01:05.230 --> 01:01:07.432
It leads to this and to this.

01:01:07.499 --> 01:01:09.134
I don't know, Ed.

01:01:09.201 --> 01:01:11.370
I smoke a little medicinal
marijuana from time to time.

01:01:11.436 --> 01:01:12.371
I've never done anything else.

01:01:12.437 --> 01:01:14.005
Oh, man, I like nothing more

01:01:14.073 --> 01:01:15.474
than getting hella stoned

01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:17.876
and grubbing
on some frozen yogurt.

01:01:17.942 --> 01:01:20.044
Tom and I used to...

01:01:20.112 --> 01:01:23.382
Well, we used to do that
a lot is all.

01:01:23.448 --> 01:01:25.850
I like smoking weed
when I'm by myself,

01:01:25.917 --> 01:01:28.987
'cause then it's like
I'm smoking with someone,

01:01:29.053 --> 01:01:31.690
but the someone is still me.

01:01:31.756 --> 01:01:33.658
I used to partake
before I knew you.

01:01:33.725 --> 01:01:35.327
Really?

01:01:35.394 --> 01:01:37.162
Who are you people?!

01:01:37.229 --> 01:01:39.731
I feel like I'm
in the Twilight Zone.

01:01:39.798 --> 01:01:42.301
Wait a minute. You brought us
all together here,

01:01:42.367 --> 01:01:44.869
because you said
you smelled crystal meth,

01:01:44.936 --> 01:01:47.172
which smells
a lot different than marijuana.

01:01:47.239 --> 01:01:49.374
I mean,
even you should know that.

01:01:49.441 --> 01:01:51.076
It was meth, right?
That's what you smelled?

01:01:52.944 --> 01:01:54.579
Eh, take a deep breath, Ed.

01:01:54.646 --> 01:01:56.681
It's a little hard
to take a deep breath, Ed,

01:01:56.748 --> 01:01:58.383
when everyone you know,
your friends and family,

01:01:58.450 --> 01:01:59.984
are dissolving
right in front of you.

01:02:00.051 --> 01:02:01.693
Ooh, I think you're having
another panic attack.

01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:03.462
You let go
of that vase, Ronny.

01:02:03.528 --> 01:02:04.696
This is an ancient
family heirloom,

01:02:04.763 --> 01:02:06.098
irreplaceable in value.

01:02:06.165 --> 01:02:07.999
- You said my name.
- So what?

01:02:08.067 --> 01:02:11.603
Dad, weren't you
just having a panic attack?

01:02:11.670 --> 01:02:13.338
- Huh?
- Yeah, just a moment ago.

01:02:13.405 --> 01:02:14.906
So what's happening now?

01:02:14.973 --> 01:02:16.575
I don't know.

01:02:16.641 --> 01:02:18.577
I believe
something here is awry.

01:02:18.643 --> 01:02:20.212
Awry? Awry?

01:02:20.279 --> 01:02:21.680
What do you mean, Ed?

01:02:21.746 --> 01:02:24.716
People don't just
snap out of panic attacks.

01:02:24.783 --> 01:02:26.785
- Maybe he's faking it.
- Faking it?

01:02:26.851 --> 01:02:28.287
Yeah, are you faking it?

01:02:28.353 --> 01:02:30.722
No, I'm not faking it!

01:02:30.789 --> 01:02:33.425
- I have diabetes!
- What?

01:02:33.492 --> 01:02:35.660
Since when
do you have diabetes?

01:02:35.727 --> 01:02:38.397
I don't.
Now you know what it feels like

01:02:38.463 --> 01:02:40.465
to be deceived by people
that you thought you knew.

01:02:40.532 --> 01:02:41.900
I have diabetes, Ed.

01:02:41.966 --> 01:02:43.935
You know that.
That's not a laughing matter.

01:02:44.002 --> 01:02:45.737
- Ooh, wow.
- Really insensitive, Dad.

01:02:45.804 --> 01:02:47.139
- What's wrong with you?
- No, not cool.

01:02:47.206 --> 01:02:49.241
Okay. Very funny, potheads!

01:02:49.308 --> 01:02:50.875
Really, really mature!

01:02:50.942 --> 01:02:52.577
You know what?!
You're all crazy!

01:02:52.644 --> 01:02:54.045
You know that? You're crazy!

01:02:57.149 --> 01:02:59.451
Someone say the "C" word?

01:02:59.518 --> 01:03:04.229
I got a Facebook message
my son is on hard drugs.

01:03:06.465 --> 01:03:10.135
Ulf here was playing
a minor-league hockey game

01:03:10.202 --> 01:03:11.603
up in Bakersfield,

01:03:11.670 --> 01:03:13.638
and we were halfway
home on the Grapevine

01:03:13.705 --> 01:03:15.507
at the TGI Fridays
when I got the message,

01:03:15.574 --> 01:03:20.745
and as soon as I did, I said
to Ulf and the rest of the team,

01:03:20.812 --> 01:03:24.116
I had to change trails,

01:03:24.183 --> 01:03:27.519
'cause the universe
is telling me

01:03:27.586 --> 01:03:30.622
that I gotta come home
and see my family.

01:03:30.689 --> 01:03:32.657
Hello, relative.

01:03:37.762 --> 01:03:39.831
- Oh, my God.
- Dad?

01:03:48.840 --> 01:03:50.041
Hi, Benjamin.

01:03:50.109 --> 01:03:51.943
Bitch! Rat! Misanthrope!

01:03:52.010 --> 01:03:54.379
You left us, Marley.

01:03:55.947 --> 01:03:59.151
I know. I did,
and I... I understand

01:03:59.218 --> 01:04:01.526
that you're all going to feel
this way towards me,

01:04:01.593 --> 01:04:03.628
but I came back anyway.

01:04:03.695 --> 01:04:06.131
You don't understand anything,
you wretched biker.

01:04:06.198 --> 01:04:07.532
What are you wearing?

01:04:09.568 --> 01:04:12.237
Two months ago,
I was walking silently

01:04:12.304 --> 01:04:14.373
on Mount Baldy with a monk.

01:04:14.439 --> 01:04:16.508
I'd been there for weeks.

01:04:16.575 --> 01:04:19.244
We hadn't exchanged one word,

01:04:19.311 --> 01:04:22.013
only utter quietude.

01:04:22.081 --> 01:04:24.516
Was he an Asian man?

01:04:24.583 --> 01:04:30.222
Now, I was imagining
the Dalai Lama or Ben Kingsley.

01:04:30.289 --> 01:04:32.424
That's exactly
what he looked like.

01:04:34.093 --> 01:04:35.860
And we were standing there,

01:04:35.927 --> 01:04:38.497
gazing out
on the Earth below us,

01:04:38.563 --> 01:04:41.200
and finally he spoke,
and you know what he said?

01:04:41.266 --> 01:04:42.601
Would you just get on with it?

01:04:42.667 --> 01:04:44.736
"None of this exists,

01:04:44.803 --> 01:04:46.871
none of it."

01:04:46.938 --> 01:04:50.742
Everything we experience
is just our senses

01:04:50.809 --> 01:04:55.380
playing little tricks
on our true selves.

01:04:55.447 --> 01:04:56.748
It's all an illusion.

01:04:56.815 --> 01:04:59.384
No one in this room is real, Ed,

01:04:59.451 --> 01:05:01.860
and change is evidence of that.

01:05:03.462 --> 01:05:06.231
Anyway, I nailed the guru, Ed.

01:05:06.298 --> 01:05:08.467
Why would you include
that detail?

01:05:08.533 --> 01:05:09.734
Yeah, I'd do you, too.

01:05:09.801 --> 01:05:11.070
You would?

01:05:12.504 --> 01:05:15.640
You're... You're a fraud.

01:05:15.707 --> 01:05:17.109
Just get out!

01:05:17.176 --> 01:05:18.877
Okay.

01:05:18.943 --> 01:05:20.645
I'll leave...

01:05:21.946 --> 01:05:23.815
but I just want to say
one more thing.

01:05:23.882 --> 01:05:25.817
No, I can't.
I can't listen to anything else.

01:05:25.884 --> 01:05:27.619
- I feel sick.
- Tough!

01:05:27.686 --> 01:05:32.091
After the purgatory and
neglect you put me through...

01:05:34.359 --> 01:05:38.163
You were the only man
I ever made love to, Ed.

01:05:38.230 --> 01:05:41.233
You just said
you nailed the guru.

01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:42.634
Yeah.

01:05:42.701 --> 01:05:45.337
Lot of men have had my body,

01:05:45.404 --> 01:05:46.905
but not my heart,

01:05:46.971 --> 01:05:50.409
not my passion, not my soul.

01:05:54.179 --> 01:05:56.381
We used to be so sexual.

01:05:58.217 --> 01:06:01.025
What happened to us
those last few years?

01:06:02.294 --> 01:06:04.796
I think we succumbed to...

01:06:04.863 --> 01:06:10.769
to the... this illusion
I was talking about, you know?

01:06:10.835 --> 01:06:15.540
I mean, we resisted change,
and we bought into the lie.

01:06:15.607 --> 01:06:18.510
You forgot I was here.

01:06:18.577 --> 01:06:22.481
A lot of times, we would sit
for hours in the same room,

01:06:22.547 --> 01:06:26.151
and you'd call out for me
like I was in another room.

01:06:26.218 --> 01:06:30.054
You would call me like I was
in another room, and I was here.

01:06:30.122 --> 01:06:31.490
I was there, Ed.

01:06:31.556 --> 01:06:32.991
I was there for 21 years.

01:06:33.057 --> 01:06:34.493
I was here.

01:06:34.559 --> 01:06:36.060
For the record,

01:06:36.128 --> 01:06:40.299
this would be threatening to me,
but I've moved on.

01:06:40.365 --> 01:06:42.033
Me, too.

01:06:42.101 --> 01:06:44.203
I didn't have to come back,

01:06:44.269 --> 01:06:47.506
but I... I wanted you
to forgive me, Ed,

01:06:47.572 --> 01:06:49.408
and I want to forgive you,

01:06:49.474 --> 01:06:51.843
and I want the kids to, too.

01:06:51.910 --> 01:06:53.845
Everything we have
will always exist,

01:06:53.912 --> 01:06:55.614
including the failures,

01:06:55.680 --> 01:06:57.916
but I want you
to let go of the anger, not...

01:06:57.982 --> 01:07:00.585
not for me, for you.

01:07:00.652 --> 01:07:02.627
Let's embrace change.

01:07:04.329 --> 01:07:07.766
Ed, dear, sweet, man.

01:07:10.435 --> 01:07:13.238
I got in an altercation
with Mitch today.

01:07:13.305 --> 01:07:14.373
Really?

01:07:14.439 --> 01:07:16.241
- Who... Who won?
- He did.

01:07:16.308 --> 01:07:18.877
Got in a few good moves,
though, Ed.

01:07:18.943 --> 01:07:21.846
That's true, bro. If it wasn't
for that arm-bar move of his,

01:07:21.913 --> 01:07:23.282
you would have kicked his ass.

01:07:23.348 --> 01:07:25.917
And then he smashed
a statue of David. It was...

01:07:25.984 --> 01:07:27.752
I don't know. It was
really dramatic and cool.

01:07:27.819 --> 01:07:29.354
Hey, Marley, it's me, Dr. Ed.

01:07:29.421 --> 01:07:30.555
- Dr. Ed.
- Yeah.

01:07:30.622 --> 01:07:32.056
It's so great
to see you again.

01:07:32.124 --> 01:07:34.093
- Good to see you.
- Oh, I forgot.

01:07:34.159 --> 01:07:37.996
This is Ulf. Ulf is
kind of my boyfriend these days,

01:07:38.062 --> 01:07:41.866
but I have a feeling
after what just transpired,

01:07:41.933 --> 01:07:44.869
we'll probably
say our goodbyes tonight.

01:07:46.138 --> 01:07:49.741
Hi. I'm Ulf, boyfriend.

01:07:51.176 --> 01:07:52.377
You know what?

01:07:52.444 --> 01:07:54.713
This is... This is all
happening too fast.

01:07:54.779 --> 01:07:56.115
I... I can't deal
with this right now.

01:07:56.181 --> 01:07:57.249
I need a smoke.

01:07:57.316 --> 01:08:00.085
Since when
did he start smoking?

01:08:00.152 --> 01:08:01.726
I don't know.
I don't think anybody knows.

01:08:01.793 --> 01:08:03.495
It could even be tonight.

01:08:03.562 --> 01:08:04.929
You wearing makeup?

01:08:04.996 --> 01:08:06.098
Is it that noticeable?

01:08:06.165 --> 01:08:08.433
Oh, it kicks ass,
is what it does.

01:08:08.500 --> 01:08:09.934
- Come on.
- All right.

01:08:10.001 --> 01:08:11.770
I could use a fiver, too.
You coming, babe?

01:08:11.836 --> 01:08:12.771
Yeah.

01:08:22.514 --> 01:08:25.450
Is this seat taken, milady?

01:08:32.823 --> 01:08:34.658
You can't blame her forever,
you know?

01:08:36.194 --> 01:08:40.299
I don't blame anyone,
except maybe Tom,

01:08:40.365 --> 01:08:43.535
but you've gotta
move on with life.

01:08:43.602 --> 01:08:46.037
Yes, you do.

01:08:48.607 --> 01:08:51.276
She used to write me
these letters...

01:08:52.877 --> 01:08:55.214
really, really long,

01:08:55.279 --> 01:08:58.317
with, like,
way too much description.

01:09:00.051 --> 01:09:03.962
And I would not write back,
because I'd be angry, but...

01:09:05.697 --> 01:09:08.399
now I realize
that she was just trying

01:09:08.466 --> 01:09:12.237
to have fun with her life
before it was too late.

01:09:13.471 --> 01:09:17.408
And so me with my relationship,

01:09:17.475 --> 01:09:18.710
I mean, that's what it was.

01:09:18.777 --> 01:09:21.580
It was just fun. It's...

01:09:21.645 --> 01:09:22.814
I don't know,

01:09:22.881 --> 01:09:28.319
like a spell
for a moment in my life.

01:09:30.122 --> 01:09:32.657
That was very insightful.

01:09:34.459 --> 01:09:36.194
Now that I've had
a few minutes to reflect,

01:09:36.261 --> 01:09:38.363
I think it was lust, not love.

01:09:38.430 --> 01:09:43.568
Well, I myself spent a very
lusty and passionate summer

01:09:43.635 --> 01:09:45.504
in Vienna
when I was young intern.

01:09:45.569 --> 01:09:48.207
Of course, still unaware
of the twists and turns

01:09:48.273 --> 01:09:50.109
this fragile
and heart-wrenching life...

01:09:50.175 --> 01:09:52.644
Not that this conversation
has become totally banal,

01:09:52.711 --> 01:09:55.180
but I have to take a piss.

01:09:55.247 --> 01:09:58.383
Oh.

01:09:58.450 --> 01:09:59.718
TMI.

01:10:01.153 --> 01:10:03.862
Listen. I wanna see
more of the girls, okay?

01:10:03.928 --> 01:10:06.465
I don't want to have to hide in
the shadow at their tournaments.

01:10:08.233 --> 01:10:10.369
You did not know
about the mascot outfit.

01:10:10.435 --> 01:10:12.137
Somebody told you about that.

01:10:14.139 --> 01:10:16.375
I know about him.

01:10:16.441 --> 01:10:19.578
Mr. '88 Games, yeah.

01:10:19.644 --> 01:10:23.014
We competed against each other
when we were kids.

01:10:23.082 --> 01:10:24.383
Doesn't matter now.

01:10:25.450 --> 01:10:27.652
Listen. I gotta go.

01:10:27.719 --> 01:10:31.223
I want the Ping-Pong table,
not a debate.

01:10:33.392 --> 01:10:35.026
Yep.

01:10:35.094 --> 01:10:36.895
Okay, then.

01:10:36.961 --> 01:10:38.730
So long.

01:10:41.400 --> 01:10:43.068
Well, how did it go?

01:10:43.135 --> 01:10:46.171
Sometimes you gotta put
your foot down on these things.

01:10:46.238 --> 01:10:47.606
You really are all man.

01:10:47.672 --> 01:10:48.773
I can't help it.

01:10:48.840 --> 01:10:49.774
<i>Yo quiero.</i>

01:10:49.841 --> 01:10:51.276
What?

01:10:51.343 --> 01:10:54.113
It's "I want you" in Spanish.

01:10:54.179 --> 01:10:56.581
That's what the dog is saying
in the commercial, "I want you"?

01:10:56.648 --> 01:10:58.117
- Yeah.
- He says that to a taco?

01:10:58.183 --> 01:10:59.384
Yeah. "I want you, tacos."

01:10:59.451 --> 01:11:00.719
I want your taco.

01:11:02.494 --> 01:11:07.932
♪ All the sand

01:11:09.168 --> 01:11:13.905

01:11:16.475 --> 01:11:18.710

01:11:37.129 --> 01:11:38.297
Hey.

01:11:39.364 --> 01:11:41.433
Hey.

01:11:41.500 --> 01:11:42.801
Where you going?

01:11:42.867 --> 01:11:46.971
Uh, home, I guess.

01:11:47.038 --> 01:11:48.973
Just like that?

01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:50.775
Yeah.

01:11:50.842 --> 01:11:53.745
Yeah, no, I get it now, Amber.

01:11:53.812 --> 01:11:56.281
I know I come on
a little strong.

01:11:56.348 --> 01:11:59.751
I, uh, feel like the best thing
I can do right now

01:11:59.818 --> 01:12:01.126
is give you a little space.

01:12:03.128 --> 01:12:05.164
I wasn't a part
of your relationship,

01:12:05.230 --> 01:12:07.932
and I'm not
a part of your family,

01:12:07.999 --> 01:12:09.834
and I never will be.

01:12:09.901 --> 01:12:11.670
Ronny, it's not like that.

01:12:11.736 --> 01:12:13.838
No, it is. It is.

01:12:13.905 --> 01:12:16.475
It's okay. You've been a...
You've been a saint

01:12:16.541 --> 01:12:20.679
for letting me tag along
as long as you have.

01:12:20.745 --> 01:12:24.383
But, hey, we had a good ride,
didn't we?

01:12:24.449 --> 01:12:26.218
Yeah, we did.

01:12:26.285 --> 01:12:28.820
It's like that biker chick
was saying a little bit ago...

01:12:28.887 --> 01:12:31.190
Oh, your mom, I guess.

01:12:31.256 --> 01:12:33.625
Sometimes things change.

01:12:33.692 --> 01:12:35.560
That's okay, too.

01:12:40.232 --> 01:12:42.401
Well, I, uh...

01:12:43.568 --> 01:12:45.470
I guess this is goodbye.

01:12:47.139 --> 01:12:48.840
Yeah, I guess.

01:12:50.475 --> 01:12:51.710
Bye, Ronny.

01:12:54.579 --> 01:12:56.014
Goodbye.

01:13:06.631 --> 01:13:09.334
So is it
just a little weed, Benjamin?

01:13:09.401 --> 01:13:13.138
Because if it's
just a little weed, I mean,

01:13:13.205 --> 01:13:15.107
you should defend yourself.

01:13:15.174 --> 01:13:16.208
You know what I'm saying?

01:13:34.826 --> 01:13:35.960
Whoa.

01:13:37.262 --> 01:13:39.464
- Oh, my God!
- Oh!

01:13:40.932 --> 01:13:42.601
What's going on?

01:13:43.835 --> 01:13:44.769
What was that?

01:13:44.836 --> 01:13:46.004
Cries of ecstasy.

01:13:46.071 --> 01:13:48.140
Sex, if I had
to venture a guess.

01:13:48.207 --> 01:13:50.809
- Oh, God! Oh, God!
- Yes! Oh, no!

01:13:50.875 --> 01:13:51.810
Oh, Ed!

01:13:51.876 --> 01:13:53.312
- What?!
- Sorry!

01:13:53.378 --> 01:13:55.414
Ed, what is wrong with you?

01:13:55.480 --> 01:13:56.448
You don't look so good.

01:13:56.515 --> 01:13:57.649
Oh, me?

01:13:57.716 --> 01:13:59.218
Oh, I'm fine.

01:13:59.284 --> 01:14:00.785
I'm just peachy.

01:14:00.852 --> 01:14:02.260
- Oh, yeah!
- Right there!

01:14:02.327 --> 01:14:03.461
Where's Benjamin?

01:14:05.797 --> 01:14:07.099
Oh, no.

01:14:28.019 --> 01:14:29.587
Listen! He's not in here!

01:14:29.654 --> 01:14:31.523
You can't take him!
You can't take my boy!

01:14:31.589 --> 01:14:33.491
- What's the password?
- I don't need a password!

01:14:33.558 --> 01:14:35.627
- I'm his father!
- And I'm his mother!

01:14:35.693 --> 01:14:37.762
What? What?!

01:14:39.731 --> 01:14:41.366
Benjamin!

01:14:41.433 --> 01:14:43.535
Benjamin, come out! I'm here!

01:14:43.602 --> 01:14:45.637
- What the hell's going on?
- Benjamin is missing.

01:14:45.704 --> 01:14:47.139
- Benjamin's missing.
- What, Dad?

01:14:47.206 --> 01:14:48.840
- Benjamin!
- Benjamin's missing!

01:14:48.907 --> 01:14:51.143
- Benjamin's missing!
- Benjamin's missing!

01:14:51.210 --> 01:14:54.213
- Benjamin's missing!
- Benjamin's missing!

01:14:54.279 --> 01:14:56.448
- Benjamin's missing!
- He's not in his room.

01:14:56.515 --> 01:14:58.883
Oh, my God.
I can't feel my feet.

01:14:58.950 --> 01:14:59.984
What did you do?

01:15:00.051 --> 01:15:01.960
So sorry. So sorry.

01:15:02.026 --> 01:15:03.195
Everybody can hear you
downstairs.

01:15:03.262 --> 01:15:05.164
Benjamin is missing, okay?

01:15:05.230 --> 01:15:07.832
Benjamin's... This is nice.
What is this?

01:15:07.899 --> 01:15:09.801
This is like
one of those Caspers, huh?

01:15:09.868 --> 01:15:10.802
Benjamin's missing.

01:15:10.869 --> 01:15:12.204
Okay. All right.

01:15:12.271 --> 01:15:13.638
Don't kill the messenger.

01:15:14.906 --> 01:15:16.541
- I'll get you a robe.
- Yeah, yeah.

01:15:16.608 --> 01:15:18.577
Benjamin!

01:15:18.643 --> 01:15:20.145
Benjamin!

01:15:20.212 --> 01:15:21.980
- Benjamin!
- Oh, my God!

01:15:22.046 --> 01:15:23.248
- Benjamin!
- Oh, my God!

01:15:23.315 --> 01:15:24.383
Benjamin!
They're in the house!

01:15:24.449 --> 01:15:25.917
- Ed!
- Dad?

01:15:25.984 --> 01:15:27.552
- Ed, the terrace.
- Benjamin!

01:15:27.619 --> 01:15:29.188
- Try the terrace.
- Terrace!

01:15:29.254 --> 01:15:30.555
Everybody, up to the terrace!

01:15:30.622 --> 01:15:32.023
The terrace?

01:15:36.661 --> 01:15:37.662
Benjamin!

01:15:39.164 --> 01:15:41.200
Oh, my God.
Jeanette, what's the password?

01:15:41.266 --> 01:15:42.734
- What?
- What's the password, Jeanette?

01:15:42.801 --> 01:15:43.735
Pomegranate.

01:15:49.007 --> 01:15:50.209
- Well...
- Well...

01:15:50.275 --> 01:15:52.211
our work here is done.

01:15:54.179 --> 01:15:55.347
Excuse us.

01:15:58.550 --> 01:15:59.818
Honey.

01:15:59.884 --> 01:16:02.094
Benjamin...

01:16:02.161 --> 01:16:03.362
I'm so sorry.

01:16:03.428 --> 01:16:06.265
You're not going
to wilderness rehab.

01:16:06.331 --> 01:16:08.233
I'm really, really sorry.

01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:11.236
I never meant
for it to go this far.

01:16:11.303 --> 01:16:14.539
It's all just like
a bad dream to me now.

01:16:14.606 --> 01:16:17.542
What felt like a dream, Ed?

01:16:21.446 --> 01:16:23.615
Do you want me to tell them
the truth, Benjamin?

01:16:23.682 --> 01:16:24.949
Is that what you want?

01:16:25.016 --> 01:16:27.386
- Wait. What truth?
- Yeah, Dad, what truth?

01:16:27.452 --> 01:16:30.155
My good son Benjamin here
isn't the one with the problem.

01:16:30.222 --> 01:16:32.157
I mean, you know,
he just smokes a little weed.

01:16:32.224 --> 01:16:33.792
I mean,
what's a little weed, right?

01:16:33.858 --> 01:16:35.294
- That's what I said.
- What we've been saying.

01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:36.661
- Yeah.
- Each of us

01:16:36.728 --> 01:16:38.430
- said that separately.
- Yeah.

01:16:38.497 --> 01:16:39.798
The truth is...

01:16:41.833 --> 01:16:43.802
when I said
I smelled crystal meth

01:16:43.868 --> 01:16:46.271
coming out of one
of the bedrooms in the house,

01:16:46.338 --> 01:16:49.007
it wasn't Benjamin's room.

01:16:49.074 --> 01:16:51.009
- It was mine.
- What?

01:16:52.544 --> 01:16:54.513
I've been on meth
for, like, four weeks now.

01:16:54.579 --> 01:16:56.281
Jeanette would come in
every morning

01:16:56.348 --> 01:16:59.484
and ask me why I'm sharpening,
like, 300 pencils a day,

01:16:59.551 --> 01:17:03.562
and I just made up some lie
in my... my stupor,

01:17:03.628 --> 01:17:05.397
in my meth-addled stupor.

01:17:05.464 --> 01:17:06.831
I blamed the one person

01:17:06.898 --> 01:17:09.368
that never did anything wrong
to me, anything,

01:17:09.434 --> 01:17:10.769
Benjamin.

01:17:12.003 --> 01:17:13.838
I've been teetering on that edge

01:17:13.905 --> 01:17:16.975
just like you
for a very long time,

01:17:17.041 --> 01:17:19.678
and you've been nothing
but the best son.

01:17:22.081 --> 01:17:23.315
- Dad, I...
- Please.

01:17:23.382 --> 01:17:25.016
Please don't hurt yourself.

01:17:25.084 --> 01:17:28.052
All I want is to be
with you and your sister

01:17:28.120 --> 01:17:30.054
and your dad, our family.

01:17:30.122 --> 01:17:31.490
Please.

01:17:31.556 --> 01:17:32.491
Is that true?

01:17:32.557 --> 01:17:34.526
Yes.

01:17:34.593 --> 01:17:36.728
- Mom, I-I'm...
- Benjamin,

01:17:36.795 --> 01:17:38.597
life's worth holding on to.

01:17:38.663 --> 01:17:41.866
I mean, I never would have
been able to embrace who I am

01:17:41.933 --> 01:17:45.104
in front of people
had I not lived.

01:17:45.170 --> 01:17:47.306
He's right.

01:17:47.372 --> 01:17:49.508
You'll know
when you fall in love

01:17:49.574 --> 01:17:51.143
and out of love,

01:17:51.210 --> 01:17:54.813
and then you realize
you had a best friend all along.

01:17:55.947 --> 01:17:58.083
You talking about me?

01:17:58.150 --> 01:17:59.151
Yeah.

01:17:59.218 --> 01:18:00.152
You mean it?

01:18:00.219 --> 01:18:02.094
Yeah, sure.

01:18:02.161 --> 01:18:05.230
And who knows?
You know, maybe more.

01:18:08.167 --> 01:18:09.701
It's true.

01:18:09.768 --> 01:18:12.104
I thought it was over
for me, too, really,

01:18:12.171 --> 01:18:14.206
and then I found this angel.

01:18:14.273 --> 01:18:16.375
I'm with your uncle now,
Benjamin,

01:18:16.441 --> 01:18:18.277
and I didn't think
that happiness

01:18:18.343 --> 01:18:20.445
was in the cards for me,
but look at me.

01:18:20.512 --> 01:18:21.446
I'm kinda happy.

01:18:21.513 --> 01:18:23.682
- Uh-huh.
- We used eBay.

01:18:23.748 --> 01:18:25.184
And Craigslist.

01:18:25.250 --> 01:18:27.419
Yes. And now we own

01:18:27.486 --> 01:18:30.422
most of the property
in and around our township.

01:18:30.489 --> 01:18:32.724
We sure do.

01:18:32.791 --> 01:18:35.927
I wonder
what I'm doing here sometimes.

01:18:35.994 --> 01:18:38.730
I wonder who people you are.

01:18:38.797 --> 01:18:41.466
I miss my hockey.

01:18:42.601 --> 01:18:43.568
I want to leave,

01:18:43.635 --> 01:18:46.905
but don't know where I ams.

01:18:50.275 --> 01:18:53.412
See, Benjamin?
Life is so worth living.

01:18:53.478 --> 01:18:54.413
Guys...

01:18:56.215 --> 01:18:58.150
I'm not gonna kill myself.

01:18:58.217 --> 01:18:59.318
I never was.

01:18:59.384 --> 01:19:01.226
- God.
- Good.

01:19:01.293 --> 01:19:02.661
Not even a little bit?

01:19:02.727 --> 01:19:04.062
No.

01:19:04.129 --> 01:19:06.065
No, I... I come out here
every once in a while

01:19:06.131 --> 01:19:08.833
to look up at the stars,
clear my head a little bit.

01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:11.770
That and I figured there
might be some kinda standoff

01:19:11.836 --> 01:19:13.972
between me and some rehab thugs.

01:19:14.038 --> 01:19:15.507
I've watched
enough daytime television

01:19:15.574 --> 01:19:16.975
to know
how these things go down.

01:19:18.843 --> 01:19:21.746
Did you know it was me
with the drug problem?

01:19:23.182 --> 01:19:25.484
I knew you had
some kind of problem

01:19:25.550 --> 01:19:27.519
that you were projecting
onto me, sure,

01:19:27.586 --> 01:19:30.189
but no, no, not once did I think

01:19:30.255 --> 01:19:34.093
that crystal meth was anything
more than an inventive ruse.

01:19:36.228 --> 01:19:39.664
But it's a really serious
addiction, Dad.

01:19:41.333 --> 01:19:42.767
You need help.

01:19:44.736 --> 01:19:46.171
I know.

01:19:46.238 --> 01:19:47.539
So just to be clear,

01:19:47.606 --> 01:19:49.774
you were never gonna
jump off the roof or the...

01:19:49.841 --> 01:19:51.576
No. O-Of course not.

01:19:51.643 --> 01:19:53.645
I... I love... I love all...

01:19:53.712 --> 01:19:55.347
- Oh!
- Oh!

01:19:55.414 --> 01:19:56.981
No!

01:19:58.217 --> 01:19:59.518
I got you, son.

01:19:59.584 --> 01:20:01.560
I got you. Come on.

01:20:01.626 --> 01:20:03.262
I got you. I got you.

01:20:03.328 --> 01:20:04.996
I got you, boy. Come on.

01:20:17.409 --> 01:20:19.311
You saved my life, Dad.

01:20:19.378 --> 01:20:20.512
That was awesome!

01:20:21.646 --> 01:20:23.948
No, you saved mine.

01:20:25.417 --> 01:20:27.152
I love you.

01:20:27.219 --> 01:20:29.254
I love all of you.

01:20:29.321 --> 01:20:30.755
Even me?

01:20:30.822 --> 01:20:33.825
Well, in a different way.

01:20:33.892 --> 01:20:35.927
What about the hockey player?

01:20:35.994 --> 01:20:37.629
Who was intimate
with your wife?

01:20:37.696 --> 01:20:40.765
Well, I don't love him.

01:20:40.832 --> 01:20:42.033
I don't hate him either.

01:20:42.101 --> 01:20:43.602
I mean, look at him.

01:20:46.538 --> 01:20:50.275
And, Rick and Jeanette,
I mean, I'm...

01:20:50.342 --> 01:20:52.544
I'm not happy
with you two right now,

01:20:52.611 --> 01:20:54.045
but I'm not mad at you either.

01:20:54.113 --> 01:20:56.047
Good. You shouldn't be.

01:20:56.115 --> 01:20:57.649
Nah.

01:20:57.716 --> 01:20:59.084
I know.

01:21:00.619 --> 01:21:04.028
I... I love you both,
and I want you to be happy.

01:21:04.096 --> 01:21:05.197
Thanks, man.

01:21:15.207 --> 01:21:16.641
I want to come home.

01:21:17.709 --> 01:21:19.144
It'll take time.

01:21:19.211 --> 01:21:22.514
Oh, Ed, time is a concept.

01:21:22.581 --> 01:21:24.483
It's only in our head.

01:21:24.549 --> 01:21:28.420
I mean, time to get off
this meth I'm on right now.

01:21:28.487 --> 01:21:31.856
Oh.

01:21:31.923 --> 01:21:34.326
I love you.

01:21:34.393 --> 01:21:36.695
I love you, too, Marley.

01:21:48.807 --> 01:21:50.675
Got room for...

01:21:52.111 --> 01:21:53.512
Get in here.

01:21:53.578 --> 01:21:55.447
