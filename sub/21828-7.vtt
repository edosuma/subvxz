WEBVTT

00:03.000 --> 00:04.834
(Ryan) Previously on Mech-X4...

00:04.917 --> 00:05.917
So, when's your next visit?

00:06.000 --> 00:08.291
Well, we have one more hospital
to build in Egypt.

00:08.375 --> 00:09.834
(sneezes)

00:09.917 --> 00:12.667
The good thing about being adopted
is I didn't inherit your weirdo sneeze.

00:12.750 --> 00:15.125
-We're gonna do great things together.
-(high-pitched humming)

00:15.208 --> 00:16.083
Ah! (groans)

00:16.166 --> 00:18.417
(Harper) I'll see you soon... partner.

00:18.500 --> 00:20.792
Grey! Whatever you're doing,
it stops now!

00:20.875 --> 00:22.375
You're too late!

00:23.792 --> 00:26.083
(Harris) This guy's power ratings
are off the charts.

00:26.166 --> 00:28.291
You will address me...

00:29.542 --> 00:31.583
as Traeger.

00:31.667 --> 00:33.500
I have no idea how to stop him.

00:34.000 --> 00:36.667
(humming)

00:38.083 --> 00:39.709
It's following me wherever I go.

00:39.792 --> 00:42.375
That's because I added
facial recognition software.

00:42.458 --> 00:44.625
Now, we can search the city
for Grey and Traeger.

00:44.709 --> 00:46.750
Yeah, what happens when we find 'em?

00:46.834 --> 00:49.041
It'll tell us where they are
and, wait for it...

00:49.125 --> 00:50.834
-Oh, heads up.
-(grunts)

00:52.041 --> 00:53.959
Stun blast. I get it. I get it.

00:54.041 --> 00:56.750
Okay, what happens
if Traeger destroys the drone?

00:56.834 --> 00:58.792
I mean, he threw
the robot like a rag doll.

00:58.875 --> 01:00.667
-Okay.
-There's nothing Ryan could do to stop it.

01:00.750 --> 01:02.417
-I was there.
-Yeah.

01:04.125 --> 01:05.542
-Dang!
-Dude!

01:05.625 --> 01:08.792
-Oh. Harris, why would you...
-No. Watch.

01:08.875 --> 01:10.291
I added nanites to the drones,

01:10.375 --> 01:12.542
little microscopic robots.

01:12.625 --> 01:13.959
When one is destroyed,

01:14.041 --> 01:17.875
the nanites will carry
all of its data to the nearest drone.

01:17.959 --> 01:19.709
No matter what happens,
we'll never lose any intel

01:19.792 --> 01:20.709
on Grey or Traeger.

01:20.792 --> 01:23.834
And, once it confirms
its target, it'll attack!

01:23.917 --> 01:25.959
(humming loudly)

01:26.041 --> 01:27.291
-Oh.
-(keyboard clacks)

01:27.375 --> 01:29.792
(computer beeps)
New target accepted.

01:31.083 --> 01:33.834
Ah. Fly.

01:33.917 --> 01:36.208
(Harris) Find the bad guys. Be free.

01:37.083 --> 01:39.792
All right. So, we're gonna be
on watch this whole weekend.

01:39.875 --> 01:44.166
Yup. No eating, no leaving to shower.
Gonna go to the bathroom right here.

01:44.875 --> 01:47.000
-We have bathrooms.
-I don't care.

01:47.083 --> 01:50.000
-(beeps)
-Hey, dingus, didn't you get Mom's text?

01:50.083 --> 01:52.166
-She wants to see us right now.
-All right. On my way.

01:52.250 --> 01:54.000
Do not go to the bathroom in here.

01:54.083 --> 01:55.333
I promise.

01:56.000 --> 01:57.959
(whispers) I gotta go
to the bathroom real quick.

02:09.166 --> 02:10.750
-What do you think Mom wants?
-I don't know,

02:10.834 --> 02:13.041
but as soon as we're done here,
we're going back to the robot.

02:13.125 --> 02:14.917
This whole weekend,
looking for bad guys.

02:15.000 --> 02:16.458
(laughs) Hey! Whoa, whoa!

02:16.542 --> 02:18.083
-Dad!
-(laughs) Dad!

02:18.166 --> 02:19.375
You guys are a little on edge.

02:19.458 --> 02:22.208
We thought you were working
at the hospital in Bolivia.

02:22.291 --> 02:24.834
Yeah, we finished up early,
so I can get home and see you guys.

02:24.917 --> 02:25.792
And check this out.

02:25.875 --> 02:28.166
I got a few tickets
for the Future Technology Expo.

02:28.250 --> 02:30.500
-(laughs)
-Dad, that's been sold out for months!

02:30.583 --> 02:31.959
Probably because slam-dunk champion

02:32.041 --> 02:34.542
Demetrious "D-Win" Winston's
gonna be there signing his new video game.

02:34.625 --> 02:36.125
(Davis) See? How perfect is that?

02:36.208 --> 02:39.083
See? Tech for Ryan, sports for you,
and music for everyone.

02:39.166 --> 02:41.458
You know DJ Live-Rat$z
performed there last year?

02:41.542 --> 02:43.417
Eh. She played a set
in our living room once.

02:43.500 --> 02:44.709
-(Davis laughs) Really?
-Mm-hmm.

02:44.792 --> 02:47.166
An international superstar DJ
played your living room?

02:47.250 --> 02:50.625
Yeah. Mom's billionaire
tech-genius ex-boyfriend paid her to.

02:50.709 --> 02:52.709
And then he tried to destroy the world.

02:52.792 --> 02:54.375
We should talk more.

02:55.709 --> 02:58.125
But thanks, Dad.
This is... this is awesome.

02:58.208 --> 02:59.583
Hey, I'm glad you're so excited.

02:59.667 --> 03:01.792
You guys didn't have
any other plans this weekend, did you?

03:01.875 --> 03:05.458
(both) Uhh... no. Nah.

03:05.542 --> 03:07.917
(laughs) Come on! Lighten up.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.375
It's a couple days with your dad.
It's not the end of the world.

03:10.458 --> 03:12.166
(parents chuckle)

03:14.959 --> 03:16.959
(theme music plays)

03:52.333 --> 03:54.417
(people chattering)

03:56.291 --> 03:57.542
(beeping)

04:04.959 --> 04:07.542
(door) Hi, there!
Welcome, Davis Walker,

04:07.625 --> 04:10.375
Mark Walker, and Ryan Walker!

04:11.625 --> 04:13.458
Okay, don't get me wrong.
This is awesome,

04:13.542 --> 04:15.291
and I love hanging out with Dad,

04:15.375 --> 04:16.917
but we're supposed
to be looking for Traeger.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.250
There's nothing we can do now.

04:18.333 --> 04:20.333
If the drones get a lead,
then we can bail,

04:20.417 --> 04:23.750
but this means a lot to Dad,
let's try to have a good time.

04:23.834 --> 04:26.542
You know what? You're right.

04:29.166 --> 04:31.375
(birds chirping)

04:31.458 --> 04:32.834
It's like we're there.

04:36.792 --> 04:39.583
(chittering)

04:39.667 --> 04:42.083
(gasps) It's like we're there.

04:42.166 --> 04:43.333
(laughs)

04:44.375 --> 04:47.375
Step right up.
Check out the latest in 3D printing.

04:47.458 --> 04:49.333
A perfect print every time.

04:51.417 --> 04:53.709
(whirs)

04:53.792 --> 04:58.291
And... it's... a... butt?

04:58.375 --> 05:00.083
(laughter)

05:00.166 --> 05:02.750
-It was supposed to look like my face.
-(woman) It does.

05:02.834 --> 05:04.750
-(laughter)
-Who said that?

05:08.166 --> 05:09.750
(hip-hop music playing)

05:09.834 --> 05:13.208
Oh! What you guys know
about the "cabbage patch"?

05:13.291 --> 05:15.750
-(laughs)
-Uh, literally nothing.

05:15.834 --> 05:18.834
-Come on.
-(laughs) Yeah.

05:18.917 --> 05:21.542
-(laughs)
-(cell phone chimes)

05:23.208 --> 05:25.959
-(clears throat)
-(chuckles)

05:26.041 --> 05:28.500
-There you go.
-(music continues)

05:29.750 --> 05:31.625
-Do you mind if I get in line for this?
-Go for it.

05:31.709 --> 05:34.208
I think we're gonna go play
Legends of Wyvern 6.

05:34.291 --> 05:36.834
-Yeah.
-As fun as that sounds, later!

05:36.917 --> 05:38.250
(laughs) Hey, I'll tell you what.

05:38.333 --> 05:40.792
I'm gonna get us some snacks.
I'll meet you at Wyvern in 15?

05:40.875 --> 05:42.083
-Heck yeah, man.
-My man!

05:51.375 --> 05:52.750
Hey, Veracity, you won?

05:52.834 --> 05:54.000
-That's awesome.
-Ah, you know.

05:54.083 --> 05:55.834
-(barks)
-Whoa! What is that?

05:55.917 --> 05:58.834
Ah. This is my robot dog.

05:58.917 --> 06:01.959
I call him... L'il Harris.

06:02.041 --> 06:05.000
(woofs) Dang, son!

06:05.083 --> 06:08.041
-Okay, Harris would actually love this.
-(laughs)

06:08.125 --> 06:10.542
Wait. You invented all of these
and won every prize?

06:10.625 --> 06:13.500
Yes. Everything
but sixth place. (sighs)

06:13.583 --> 06:15.125
Kristi Medlin.

06:17.917 --> 06:22.333
But... this baby right here
is what won me first place.

06:22.417 --> 06:24.500
(clears throat) The Buzzkill.

06:24.583 --> 06:28.291
A hand-held annoying-person
device disabler. Here, watch.

06:28.375 --> 06:29.792
-(girl chatting)
-(humming)

06:29.875 --> 06:31.375
All I did was take a selfie
at the funeral,

06:31.458 --> 06:33.917
and everyone
made such a big deal out of it.

06:34.000 --> 06:36.875
I was... hello? Grandma?

06:36.959 --> 06:38.458
(phone beeps)

06:40.208 --> 06:43.166
It sends out a signal
that stops digital butthead behavior,

06:43.250 --> 06:45.125
you know, like texting during a movie,

06:45.208 --> 06:48.375
talking too loud
on a cell phone, et cetera.

06:48.458 --> 06:52.458
-You're kinda scary.
-(laughs) Mmm. Yeah.

06:54.542 --> 06:55.709
-Later.
-Yeah.

06:57.542 --> 06:59.667
(hip-hop music plays)

07:01.458 --> 07:03.750
Is this where I meet Demetrius Winston?

07:04.417 --> 07:05.750
Am I in the right line?

07:05.834 --> 07:08.583
(angelic choir sings)

07:08.667 --> 07:11.291
I'm in the right line. Yup.

07:11.375 --> 07:13.125
Smooth.

07:13.208 --> 07:15.625
Hey, has anyone ever told you
that your princess dress

07:15.709 --> 07:18.166
really brings out the flecks
of amber in your eyes?

07:18.250 --> 07:20.667
-(laughs) Less smooth.
-(clears throat)

07:20.750 --> 07:24.208
I'm Emeline of Navarre,
ruthless warrior.

07:24.291 --> 07:27.166
Umm... I like your shield thing.

07:27.250 --> 07:30.250
You mean my plus four
Shield of Gragaloon?

07:30.333 --> 07:32.291
Sure.

07:32.375 --> 07:34.542
Sorry, no, I have no idea
what any of this is.

07:34.625 --> 07:38.125
(laughs) That's okay.
You're lucky you're cute.

07:38.208 --> 07:39.875
It really does help.

07:39.959 --> 07:41.083
(laughs)

07:41.166 --> 07:42.750
I am Emeline of Navarre!

07:42.834 --> 07:44.917
We can free the king!
Ready your sword.

07:45.000 --> 07:46.959
-(grunts)
-There may be trolls.

07:47.041 --> 07:51.041
(both grunting)

07:51.125 --> 07:52.625
(cell phone chimes)

07:57.542 --> 08:01.041
Ryan. Hey, man, we don't have to play
if you don't want to.

08:01.125 --> 08:03.375
No, no, my friends are
constantly blowing up my phone.

08:03.458 --> 08:05.000
You know how it is. Yeah, Dad.

08:05.083 --> 08:06.792
Come on. Let's play. Come on.

08:07.375 --> 08:11.250
Well there, Harris, Veracity won
the Junior Inventor's competition.

08:11.333 --> 08:12.917
(beeps)

08:13.000 --> 08:16.250
-Why did you not win?
-All of my inventions go into...

08:16.333 --> 08:18.917
Oh, I don't know... killing monsters.

08:19.000 --> 08:21.583
Since when did you start
reading the Bay City Planet?

08:21.667 --> 08:23.083
Since always.

08:23.166 --> 08:25.417
Their bloggers are never afraid
to say what needs to be said.

08:25.500 --> 08:27.875
(beeping)

08:27.959 --> 08:28.959
(Harris) Bam!

08:29.041 --> 08:32.083
We've got a possible match
at Bay City International Airport.

08:32.166 --> 08:35.625
(scoffs) It's a distorted reflection,
but it could be Traeger.

08:35.709 --> 08:39.750
Or it could be Canadian Prime Minister,
Justin Trudeau.

08:39.834 --> 08:43.166
-Why would it be Justin Trudeau?
-Why not?

08:44.583 --> 08:46.875
-(Spyder) Should we tell Ryan and Mark?
-Not yet.

08:46.959 --> 08:47.792
You know Ryan.

08:47.875 --> 08:51.000
If he even thinks it's a bad guy,
he'll bail out on his dad.

08:51.083 --> 08:52.959
-We need to make sure.
-Okay.

08:53.041 --> 08:54.792
If it is Traeger,
we'll shoot him with trackers

08:54.875 --> 08:56.750
and hunt him down
with Ryan and Mech-X4.

08:56.834 --> 08:58.542
I just hope he doesn't feel it
when they hit.

08:58.625 --> 09:01.583
-(mech-link hums, firing)
-Yeah, I wouldn't worry about that.

09:01.667 --> 09:03.750
What? (gasps)

09:05.625 --> 09:08.458
Dude, not cool.
Let's see how you like it.

09:08.542 --> 09:12.208
-Ah!
-Not the eyes! Not the eyes!

09:14.333 --> 09:16.250
We don't have time for this.
Let's get to the airport.

09:16.333 --> 09:18.667
Come on, there's always time
to shoot your friend in the butt.

09:18.750 --> 09:20.166
(grunts) Dang, son.

09:20.250 --> 09:22.166
No, there is no way

09:22.250 --> 09:24.333
that they would've made it
to the playoffs without D-Win!

09:24.417 --> 09:26.542
He is a beast at offense.

09:26.625 --> 09:28.333
They're trash without his three.

09:28.417 --> 09:31.000
(laughs) They still have
Perkins and Ivanovich.

09:31.083 --> 09:33.667
-Those guys are useless.
-Wow.

09:33.750 --> 09:36.583
We might have to settle this
over some jalapeño poppers.

09:36.667 --> 09:39.917
Actually... I do know a great place.

09:40.000 --> 09:42.083
Oh. Okay.

09:42.166 --> 09:44.792
(humming, beeping)

09:48.625 --> 09:50.250
(clears throat) Uh...

09:50.875 --> 09:52.125
I gotta go.

09:59.458 --> 10:02.375
(both grunting)

10:03.500 --> 10:05.917
(Davis) We must get you
to the White Witch for a healing poultice.

10:06.000 --> 10:08.375
To the trunk of the white tree,
and watch out for trolls.

10:08.458 --> 10:11.166
(both grunting)

10:11.250 --> 10:14.917
Oh, straight to the Internet.

10:19.875 --> 10:21.875
(clicks, chimes)

10:21.959 --> 10:23.917
Ryan, where are you?
We're being hunted!

10:25.458 --> 10:28.500
(humming loudly)

10:28.583 --> 10:29.750
We are.

10:32.166 --> 10:33.417
(humming loudly)

10:35.166 --> 10:37.208
(Davis grunting)

10:44.083 --> 10:45.583
Why is one of Harris's
hunter drones here?

10:45.667 --> 10:47.542
I don't know.
It looks like it was after you.

10:47.625 --> 10:50.166
(beeping)

10:53.417 --> 10:56.083
When Harris showed me these,
they targeted me first.

10:56.166 --> 10:57.792
-Maybe it's a glitch.
-(Davis grunting)

10:57.875 --> 10:59.000
Hey, man.

11:01.166 --> 11:03.667
I will be your Emeline of Navarre!

11:04.792 --> 11:07.208
-(laughs) Huh?
-Sure, man.

11:07.291 --> 11:11.166
Yeah! Woo-hoo! Hyah!

11:12.333 --> 11:14.083
-We have to get back to Dad.
-(whirring)

11:14.166 --> 11:15.709
-Look out!
-(people shout)

11:23.000 --> 11:26.291
-(people yelp)
-So, now regular tech is after me?

11:26.375 --> 11:28.959
(beeping)

11:31.166 --> 11:32.709
Wait. Harris's nanites are in there.

11:32.792 --> 11:34.750
He said they were designed
to spread to other drones.

11:34.834 --> 11:37.166
-He didn't say anything about other tech.
-Can't you just zap 'em?

11:37.250 --> 11:38.792
(whirring)

11:41.333 --> 11:44.375
No, there's too many.
It's like a thousand tiny little robots!

11:44.458 --> 11:45.750
(explosion)

11:47.000 --> 11:49.250
The nanites are infecting
all the tech around us,

11:49.333 --> 11:51.041
but they're not compatible.

11:51.125 --> 11:54.417
Great, so it's either gonna explode
and hurt a lot of people or attack us.

11:54.500 --> 11:55.709
I'm gonna call Harris.

11:55.792 --> 11:56.875
(beeps)

12:08.041 --> 12:09.792
-(gasps)
-(Harris) It is Traeger!

12:10.417 --> 12:12.583
Okay, we should probably go invisible.

12:12.667 --> 12:13.667
(buzzes)

12:13.750 --> 12:15.583
There's not enough power
left to go invisible.

12:15.667 --> 12:17.250
I asked you to charge
these things yesterday.

12:17.333 --> 12:18.750
I asked you to not ask me to do things.

12:18.834 --> 12:20.959
(sighs) We need to figure out
what they're doing.

12:21.041 --> 12:22.875
(panting)

12:22.959 --> 12:25.834
(beeps, humming)

12:25.917 --> 12:27.166
(grunts)

12:28.041 --> 12:30.166
(beeps, hums)

12:30.250 --> 12:33.166
Steel girders, PVC piping,

12:33.250 --> 12:34.917
and some sort of polymide.

12:36.166 --> 12:37.125
Oh, no.

12:38.166 --> 12:39.917
Oh, no, no, no. Not polymide.

12:41.208 --> 12:42.458
I don't know what that is.

12:42.542 --> 12:45.375
It's an element they use
to protect equipment during cold weather.

12:45.458 --> 12:46.625
(phone rings loudly)

12:46.709 --> 12:47.959
-Hmm?
-(shushing)

12:48.041 --> 12:49.792
(beeps, ringing stops)

12:58.875 --> 13:00.917
(voicemail) You've reached Harris.
Leave a message, y'all.

13:01.000 --> 13:02.208
He isn't answering his phone.

13:02.291 --> 13:05.208
Looks like we're gonna have
to deal with this ourselves.

13:09.834 --> 13:12.000
(drone buzzes)

13:13.208 --> 13:14.667
-(Veracity) Oh!
-(beeping)

13:16.875 --> 13:19.500
Bam! (growls)

13:19.583 --> 13:22.083
First thing we have to do
is get away from all these people.

13:22.166 --> 13:24.500
If the tech is after me,
we can just lead it away.

13:24.583 --> 13:25.667
Then let's go.

13:26.208 --> 13:29.125
-(beeping)
-(whirring)

13:35.000 --> 13:37.834
(people chattering)

13:39.709 --> 13:41.834
All right, here I am!
Come and get me!

13:45.125 --> 13:46.875
What's going on?
That stuff wasn't after me?

13:46.959 --> 13:48.667
(L'il Harris barking, growling)

13:48.750 --> 13:49.959
I'm sorry.

13:51.000 --> 13:52.000
Sorry.

13:52.083 --> 13:53.500
Whoa! Sorry, sorry, sorry.

13:53.583 --> 13:56.041
-(growling continues)
-(Veracity) Hey!

13:56.125 --> 13:59.583
Uh... down boy.
What is wrong with you?

13:59.667 --> 14:00.834
I will put you down.

14:00.917 --> 14:03.125
(high-pitched humming)

14:04.542 --> 14:06.542
-(people screaming)
-It's after Veracity?

14:06.625 --> 14:09.250
(Mark) Wait. Was she around
every time the tech attacked?

14:09.333 --> 14:10.834
Yeah, I think she was.

14:11.750 --> 14:13.917
It was targeting her.
You were just in the way.

14:14.000 --> 14:15.709
But why is the tech targeting Veracity?

14:15.792 --> 14:18.792
(gasps) Dude, not cool.

14:18.875 --> 14:20.583
Let's see how you like it.

14:20.667 --> 14:23.250
-Ah!
-(both grunting)

14:23.333 --> 14:24.875
(beeping)

14:24.959 --> 14:27.625
(L'il Harris growling)

14:28.875 --> 14:30.041
(powers down)

14:30.125 --> 14:32.208
(people screaming)

14:32.291 --> 14:33.500
Scary.

14:33.583 --> 14:36.875
-Uh, Veracity's gonna get hurt.
-And anyone who's around her.

14:36.959 --> 14:38.250
(Davis) Ryan!

14:39.875 --> 14:42.041
Okay, I'm gonna protect
Veracity, you deal with Dad.

14:42.125 --> 14:43.041
Okay.

14:44.750 --> 14:46.709
-You okay?
-Oh, yeah, never better.

14:46.792 --> 14:48.750
(whirring)

14:48.834 --> 14:49.834
-Whoa!
-Oh!

14:53.667 --> 14:54.834
What is going on?

14:54.917 --> 14:56.709
It's the first time
I've seen you in a month.

14:56.792 --> 14:58.375
It seems like you couldn't care less.

14:58.458 --> 15:00.458
-(whirring)
-No, Dad, that's not true.

15:03.583 --> 15:05.583
-(humming)
-What is it, son?

15:05.667 --> 15:07.083
You can tell me anything.

15:07.166 --> 15:09.458
Dad, can you please
just give me some space?

15:12.000 --> 15:13.709
(sighs) Yeah.

15:20.792 --> 15:22.375
(beeping)

15:24.625 --> 15:26.417
-(door) Exits are now sealed.
-(screaming)

15:26.500 --> 15:28.792
Targeting Veracity Campbell.

15:28.875 --> 15:30.250
I'm sorry. What?

15:31.792 --> 15:33.000
(man) Let us out!

15:33.625 --> 15:35.792
Great. We're trapped in here.

15:36.375 --> 15:39.583
Every piece of tech in here
is a Veracity-seeking missile.

15:42.291 --> 15:45.291
See? This is what happens
when you are the smartest kid in Bay City.

15:45.375 --> 15:47.500
Somebody programmed
all of this tech to attack me.

15:47.583 --> 15:48.834
Who would do such a thing?

15:48.917 --> 15:51.250
There's only one person
who is smart enough

15:51.333 --> 15:53.166
and petty enough to do this.

15:54.291 --> 15:56.166
Kristi Medlin.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.458
-(people screaming)
-Yeah! That's who it was, Kristi Medlin.

16:02.542 --> 16:05.417
-Definitely not Harris.
-If I could just get to my Buzzkill

16:05.500 --> 16:07.709
and then I could crank it up,
then it might have the power

16:07.792 --> 16:10.875
to end all the tech at once,
but it's back at my booth.

16:18.417 --> 16:21.166
(Grey) The plane is fully loaded.
It's good to go.

16:21.250 --> 16:23.917
Take it to the destination
and wait for me there.

16:24.000 --> 16:25.917
There's one more thing I need.

16:33.041 --> 16:35.166
-What are you doing?
-To find out where they're going.

16:35.250 --> 16:38.041
-(people screaming)
-(whirring)

16:41.250 --> 16:44.125
(whirring)

16:44.208 --> 16:45.375
(people scream)

16:45.458 --> 16:48.041
(light jazz music playing)

16:50.417 --> 16:52.917
-We're gonna get you to your booth.
-Yeah, let's get to work.

16:53.917 --> 16:55.625
(whirring)

16:59.417 --> 17:03.542
Hey, Mark, things are getting crazy.
You might need this.

17:04.333 --> 17:06.375
She remembers my name.
It's 'cause I'm cute.

17:06.458 --> 17:08.333
Focus! You're not that cute.

17:08.417 --> 17:09.625
Go!

17:10.458 --> 17:15.208
(rock music playing)

17:30.291 --> 17:32.417
(whirring)

17:47.792 --> 17:49.542
(thuds, yelps)

17:50.959 --> 17:52.834
(groaning)

17:54.375 --> 17:56.500
Whoa, whoa! Hey! Harris!

17:56.583 --> 17:57.458
That was awesome.

17:57.542 --> 17:59.500
You were like a superhero
in an action movie.

17:59.583 --> 18:03.083
Owie! Oh!
Mommy's precious cargo got an owie!

18:03.166 --> 18:05.542
When I tell this story,
I'll leave that part out.

18:05.625 --> 18:08.542
-(rumbling)
-(people screaming)

18:08.625 --> 18:11.291
(roars, clangs)

18:11.375 --> 18:12.709
Oh, no.

18:19.625 --> 18:21.417
(Ryan) It's not stopping!

18:21.500 --> 18:24.709
(whirring)

18:29.166 --> 18:31.083
(Veracity) Mark! The Buzzkill!

18:41.875 --> 18:43.250
(Ryan) They're gonna blow!

18:43.333 --> 18:46.834
-(whirring)
-(roars)

18:46.917 --> 18:50.667
(grunts) There's not enough power!
There's just too many of them!

18:51.417 --> 18:52.667
(humming)

18:56.291 --> 18:59.166
(whirring stops)

19:02.959 --> 19:05.875
-(man) What happened?
-(chuckles) Wow.

19:06.709 --> 19:08.709
I-I'm more impressive than I thought.

19:08.792 --> 19:11.250
(laughs)

19:11.417 --> 19:13.208
Don't ever tell Harris we did that.

19:13.291 --> 19:15.625
-Done and done. Okay, yeah.
-Cool. Go, go.

19:15.709 --> 19:19.166
-Hey, Emeline of Navarre.
-(giggles)

19:19.250 --> 19:21.250
Here's some of your shield back.

19:22.208 --> 19:25.041
-I'm really sorry.
-It's plastic.

19:25.125 --> 19:29.417
It was the price of like one basket
of jalapeño poppers.

19:29.500 --> 19:33.291
Oh, okay. Well, that's,
what, six bucks? Six-fifty?

19:33.375 --> 19:35.291
(guffaws) I mean...

19:35.375 --> 19:38.458
I want you to take me out
for jalapeño poppers, champ.

19:38.542 --> 19:40.291
-Oh.
-Wow.

19:40.375 --> 19:42.709
You're really bad at this.

19:42.792 --> 19:44.208
Give me your phone.

19:44.959 --> 19:45.875
(laughs)

19:47.125 --> 19:49.917
Text me... if you want.

19:51.250 --> 19:52.333
You know...

19:53.000 --> 19:55.166
every Emeline needs a Merek.

19:56.041 --> 19:57.917
I could pull that off.

19:58.000 --> 20:00.166
-(growls)
-(laughing)

20:03.875 --> 20:05.750
Ryan! They finally got the doors open.

20:05.834 --> 20:07.250
Are you okay, man?
I was so worried.

20:07.333 --> 20:09.125
Yeah, Dad, we're-we're okay.

20:09.667 --> 20:11.542
Seriously, we're fine.

20:11.625 --> 20:12.959
Good.

20:13.709 --> 20:16.375
So, about before...

20:16.458 --> 20:19.208
Yeah, Dad, about what
I said back there. I...

20:19.291 --> 20:21.417
When you told me
I should give you some space,

20:21.500 --> 20:22.542
at the top of your lungs?

20:22.625 --> 20:25.333
(chuckles) Yeah, I'm really sorry.

20:25.417 --> 20:28.500
-That was really harsh, and I...
-No, no, Ryan, I get it.

20:29.208 --> 20:30.417
You're a teenager now.

20:30.500 --> 20:32.792
I mean, why would you want
to hang out with your lame dad?

20:32.875 --> 20:34.959
No, Dad, I like hanging out with you,

20:35.041 --> 20:37.917
even when my head's buried
in my phone when I do.

20:38.417 --> 20:40.333
Believe me, I really do.

20:41.542 --> 20:42.750
So, we're cool?

20:43.875 --> 20:46.458
-What do we say?
-(both) Frosty.

20:46.542 --> 20:48.208
(laughs)

20:51.875 --> 20:56.125
Okay, I am really sorry
about the nanite stuff.

20:56.208 --> 20:58.834
I definitely didn't think
it could spread to other tech.

20:58.917 --> 21:01.000
-I can't believe you took on Traeger.
-Yeah.

21:01.083 --> 21:03.291
-Are you insane?
-It was awesome.

21:04.166 --> 21:07.041
(whispers) Yeah, left the part out
about "mommy's precious cargo."

21:07.125 --> 21:10.166
-I'm sorry. What was that?
-Don't-don't worry about it.

21:10.250 --> 21:11.834
I'm just glad you're okay.

21:12.959 --> 21:15.083
So... what's next?

21:16.041 --> 21:18.542
We watch this guy's every move...

21:18.625 --> 21:19.583
(beeping)

21:19.667 --> 21:22.083
...and when the time is right,
we take this guy down.

21:22.166 --> 21:23.375
For good.

21:30.041 --> 21:33.542
(ominous music plays)

21:33.625 --> 21:36.375
(whirring)

21:46.500 --> 21:49.291
-(whirs)
-(creaks, clunks)

21:49.375 --> 21:50.667
Well, what do you know?

21:53.959 --> 21:55.375
It works.

22:03.291 --> 22:06.750
(theme music plays)

22:29.375 --> 22:30.250
(barks)
