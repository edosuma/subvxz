Your mission, should
you choose to accept it,

00:21.387 --> 00:22.720
is to take this
little camera here,

00:22.722 --> 00:24.556
go down that path
to the old Brandt house

00:24.558 --> 00:26.091
and stand on the porch,
all right?

00:26.093 --> 00:27.559
You hold it up.
Show us you made it.

00:27.561 --> 00:28.793
- That's it?
- That's it.

00:28.795 --> 00:31.563
And if you make it, you might
be a part of the Hell Gang.

00:31.565 --> 00:34.468
Screw you guys.
I got a flashlight.

00:40.508 --> 00:43.576
There better be a freaking house
at the end of this damn road.

00:43.578 --> 00:45.414
What the hell?

00:51.152 --> 00:53.351
Oh, Billy, man.

00:53.353 --> 00:54.753
Come on.

00:54.755 --> 00:57.058
Do you really
have to do this shit?

00:58.191 --> 01:00.128
Oh, shit.
Here we go.

01:02.296 --> 01:03.999
Oh, damn it.

01:05.132 --> 01:07.369
Oh, freaking A.

01:13.308 --> 01:14.711
Shit.

01:16.812 --> 01:18.444
Oh, shit!

01:18.446 --> 01:20.049
Oh...

01:20.782 --> 01:23.418
Oh, my gosh,
I freaking hate spiders.

01:27.157 --> 01:28.491
Oh, damn it.

01:38.167 --> 01:41.237
What the hell? Guys!

01:43.506 --> 01:45.575
Guys, it's not funny.

01:48.212 --> 01:49.447
You playing games with me?

02:01.192 --> 02:03.425
Guys?

02:03.427 --> 02:05.127
Guys, is that you?

02:05.129 --> 02:06.431
Guys!

02:31.656 --> 02:33.391
What the hell?

02:35.559 --> 02:37.196
A swimming pool.

03:12.865 --> 03:14.234
What the hell?

03:15.268 --> 03:16.603
Where am I?

03:21.674 --> 03:24.512
Little girl? Little girl?

03:29.417 --> 03:30.552
Whoa!

04:13.330 --> 04:16.666
Sweetie? It's okay.

04:18.935 --> 04:21.404
It's okay. It's okay.

04:27.543 --> 04:29.180
I'm sorry.

04:32.781 --> 04:34.752
Oh, no, no. God no.

04:40.524 --> 04:41.860
What the hell?

04:43.394 --> 04:46.427
How did I get here?
How did I get here?

04:46.429 --> 04:48.731
Where's the pool?
Where's the pool?

04:48.733 --> 04:49.965
What the hell?

08:52.085 --> 08:53.852
Dude, are we finally here?

08:53.854 --> 08:55.654
Yeah.

08:55.656 --> 08:57.088
You know, for a place
that's supposed to be abandoned,

08:57.090 --> 08:59.024
this really doesn't
look like it.

08:59.026 --> 09:00.727
Seriously?

09:00.729 --> 09:02.262
It's cool though,
right?

09:02.264 --> 09:04.097
But do you think this place
is scary enough

09:04.099 --> 09:06.766
to keep sending people here
for the Hell Gang challenge?

09:06.768 --> 09:09.002
Dude, what kind of
question was that? Of course.

09:09.004 --> 09:10.703
It's probably
terrifying at night.

09:10.705 --> 09:12.208
Yeah.

09:13.107 --> 09:15.141
Hey, what's up there?

09:15.143 --> 09:16.642
Oh, that must be the pool.

09:16.644 --> 09:18.210
Want to check it out?

09:18.212 --> 09:19.112
No, man. No. Come on.

09:19.114 --> 09:20.113
We're here
to find Billy,

09:20.115 --> 09:23.181
- and I can't get ahold of him.
- Are you serious?

09:23.183 --> 09:25.786
Fine, let's find a place
where we have service

09:25.788 --> 09:27.186
and we'll call him.

09:27.188 --> 09:28.989
And you have
footage of that anyway.

09:28.991 --> 09:30.691
Austin, come on.

09:30.693 --> 09:31.959
Okay, I'm coming.

09:31.961 --> 09:33.263
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

09:42.672 --> 09:45.339
Luke, smile.

09:45.341 --> 09:47.307
Come on.

09:54.885 --> 09:56.784
Hey, you're here!

09:56.786 --> 09:59.122
It's party time, man.
Come on.

10:01.824 --> 10:03.124
- Hey, new guy.
- Hey, dude,

10:03.126 --> 10:04.759
thank you so much
for the invite, man.

10:04.761 --> 10:07.328
I mean, this party is just
supposed to be amazing.

10:07.330 --> 10:08.863
You can't ask questions.

10:08.865 --> 10:10.230
You have to be a member
of Hell Gang first.

10:10.232 --> 10:12.268
People have to like you.
So smile.

10:12.270 --> 10:14.703
- But don't be creepy.
- You wanna be our friend.

10:14.705 --> 10:16.938
- But don't try so hard.
- So stand up straight.

10:16.940 --> 10:19.274
You're slouching.
Fix your hair. Your hair.

10:21.079 --> 10:22.812
I like it, I like it.

10:22.814 --> 10:26.348
You guys are really
going all Oceans 11.

10:26.350 --> 10:28.384
Of course, it's
kind of my favorite movie.

10:28.386 --> 10:30.086
Why is this a dudes-only thing?

10:30.088 --> 10:31.656
Because it's Hell Gang only.

10:33.156 --> 10:34.756
I suppose you have a tree house

10:34.758 --> 10:35.992
with a "no girls allowed" sign
too.

10:35.994 --> 10:37.227
We should get one of those.

10:37.229 --> 10:38.661
Too bad.

10:38.663 --> 10:40.229
Hey, Hayley.

10:40.231 --> 10:42.632
Are you kidding me?
I need to clean the lens now.

10:42.634 --> 10:45.102
Do I always
have to be your...

10:48.706 --> 10:50.339
- You love me?
- I love you.

10:50.341 --> 10:51.977
Aww!

10:53.745 --> 10:55.712
We have yet to find someone
to pass the challenge.

10:55.714 --> 10:57.848
The only other person
brave enough to try it failed.

10:57.850 --> 10:59.349
Failed terribly.

10:59.351 --> 11:02.786
So... so we remain
Lucky 13.

11:02.788 --> 11:06.391
Cheers, cheers, unless Eddie
here makes it to the mansion.

11:06.393 --> 11:08.963
- To the mansion.
- Yeah, right!

11:12.264 --> 11:14.831
There was a couple, the Brandts.

11:14.833 --> 11:16.968
And Mr. Brandt would do
whatever it takes

11:16.970 --> 11:19.170
to make his wife happy.

11:19.172 --> 11:21.406
First, he made her a mansion.

11:21.408 --> 11:23.941
But that didn't do it for her.

11:23.943 --> 11:26.244
What made her happier than ever
was kids.

11:28.214 --> 11:30.816
And she was in labor
with the 13th child.

11:30.818 --> 11:35.756
And the baby chokes itself
with its own umbilical cord...

11:37.091 --> 11:39.628
and rips her insides out.

11:40.694 --> 11:42.194
He saw his kids differently.

11:42.196 --> 11:44.696
He thought they were
the very reason his wife died.

11:44.698 --> 11:47.833
He calls them down one by one
to the root cellar,

11:47.835 --> 11:50.736
and hangs them all.

11:50.738 --> 11:52.772
And then he hangs himself.

11:52.774 --> 11:55.475
So now the mansion's haunted
with all their spirits,

11:55.477 --> 11:57.177
including Mrs. Brandt.

11:57.179 --> 11:59.446
So you find yourself in
the wrong place in that house,

11:59.448 --> 12:01.114
and you might hear a scream.

12:01.116 --> 12:03.716
Hear kids running.

12:03.718 --> 12:05.452
Or you might feel something
on your neck.

12:05.454 --> 12:07.187
Mr. Brandt...

12:07.189 --> 12:09.322
getting ready
to hang you next.

12:19.167 --> 12:20.736
Ha!

12:25.874 --> 12:27.374
I'm just saying, like,
I would feel better

12:27.376 --> 12:29.209
if we knew
what actually happened.

12:29.211 --> 12:31.312
You want to know why no one
knows what actually happened?

12:31.314 --> 12:33.047
Because no one wants to.

12:33.049 --> 12:34.914
Because that wouldn't make
amusing little stories

12:34.916 --> 12:37.218
to tell your friends in front
of a campfire, would it?

12:37.220 --> 12:39.020
Thank you, buzzkill. Thank you.

12:41.023 --> 12:42.824
Maybe we should
just leave it alone then.

12:42.826 --> 12:44.162
Eddie, Eddie, Eddie,
Eddie, buddy.

12:49.066 --> 12:50.799
You're not giving up already,
are you?

12:50.801 --> 12:52.099
No. Dude, I'm good.

12:52.101 --> 12:53.769
Then let's go. Let's go.

12:53.771 --> 12:55.771
Come on.

13:02.179 --> 13:04.816
It'll be okay.
Come on.

13:11.288 --> 13:13.792
Aah!
Jesus Christ, dude.

13:15.326 --> 13:17.794
You seriously left the party
early to start editing?

13:17.796 --> 13:19.228
Yeah.

13:19.230 --> 13:20.930
You don't even have
all the footage yet.

13:20.932 --> 13:22.498
No, I know. Yo, is Eddie
ready to go, though?

13:22.500 --> 13:24.201
Yeah, we're all in the van
waiting for you.

13:24.203 --> 13:25.502
Okay, all right,
just let me save.

13:25.504 --> 13:26.840
- All right, come on.
- Yeah.

13:28.039 --> 13:30.941
Okay... all right, yeah.
Coming.

13:30.943 --> 13:32.241
Don't forget your camera.

13:32.243 --> 13:33.479
Right. Good call, good call.

13:43.255 --> 13:44.855
What about Billy?
What happened to him?

13:44.857 --> 13:46.056
From the video?

13:46.058 --> 13:47.826
Is he still pissed at you guys,
or what?

13:47.828 --> 13:50.061
I hope not. We were
just messing with him.

13:50.063 --> 13:52.362
Didn't he say something
about having to move again?

13:52.364 --> 13:53.932
Move again?

13:53.934 --> 13:55.332
Yeah, yeah.
His dad is in the military.

13:55.334 --> 13:57.101
He moves all over
the place.

13:57.103 --> 13:59.069
It's pretty cool. He even spent
some time in Germany.

13:59.071 --> 14:01.272
I think he said he was moving
to San Diego, right?

14:01.274 --> 14:03.040
Yeah.

14:03.042 --> 14:05.442
Why do you think we chose him
to do the challenge?

14:05.444 --> 14:08.580
I mean, even if he made it, he'd
only be here for a couple weeks.

14:08.582 --> 14:10.514
We wanted to
give him a chance, man.

14:10.516 --> 14:14.352
I mean, you imagine
moving every few months?

14:14.354 --> 14:16.454
Having to make
new friends.

14:16.456 --> 14:18.289
It would suck.

14:18.291 --> 14:20.059
So why'd you guys
pick me?

14:20.061 --> 14:22.026
I mean, I'm not moving around
every few months, so...

14:22.028 --> 14:24.096
Because we picked you.
It doesn't matter.

14:24.098 --> 14:25.865
You're cool,
I guess.

14:25.867 --> 14:27.600
I mean, if we're going
to have anybody in the gang,

14:27.602 --> 14:29.968
might as well not be an asshole,
right?

14:29.970 --> 14:31.569
Cool. Thanks, guys.

14:31.571 --> 14:33.371
Yeah, but don't get too excited,
all right?

14:33.373 --> 14:35.208
Okay, you're not
going to make it anyway.

14:35.210 --> 14:36.609
You're totally going
to pussy out.

14:36.611 --> 14:38.944
Hey, he can do it.
Come on. You'll see.

14:38.946 --> 14:40.048
No...

14:41.383 --> 14:43.382
- What is going on?
- Beer run, bitches!

14:43.384 --> 14:45.084
Oh, beer run.
Beer run.

14:45.086 --> 14:47.119
Actually, Chase, Chase,

14:47.121 --> 14:48.420
I'm definitely going
to need a beer.

14:48.422 --> 14:49.890
Follow them.

14:49.892 --> 14:51.290
Hey, I'm actually gonna cut it.

14:51.292 --> 14:53.159
It always trips me out
when we go get beer.

14:53.161 --> 14:54.597
It takes forever.

14:58.133 --> 14:59.666
Muzo, that's you.

14:59.668 --> 15:01.904
- I got it. I got it.
- Talk to your boy.

15:04.673 --> 15:06.474
Do you think
he's giving up already?

15:06.476 --> 15:07.974
- Maybe.
- To be honest,

15:07.976 --> 15:09.210
even if he is,
I don't blame him.

15:09.212 --> 15:11.078
He better not.
We need the footage.

15:11.080 --> 15:12.546
Nothing's going
to happen to you.

15:12.548 --> 15:14.348
I'm not going to let anything
happen to you.

15:14.350 --> 15:16.017
I mean, let's be real.
Even if he does it,

15:16.019 --> 15:17.618
are we actually going
to let him in the group?

15:17.620 --> 15:19.019
- Probably not.
- Yo, look,

15:19.021 --> 15:20.253
I got to be honest
with you guys.

15:20.255 --> 15:21.622
I know I got a little hot
earlier.

15:21.624 --> 15:23.292
But I just... I really...
No, I'm serious...

15:23.294 --> 15:25.159
Keith, you're never hot, buddy.

15:25.161 --> 15:27.229
Of course you're going to be
part of the Hell Gang, man.

15:27.231 --> 15:29.431
Something doesn't feel
right about this entire thing.

15:29.433 --> 15:32.066
- Nothing feels right.
- All right, he's smiling.

15:38.141 --> 15:39.474
- You good?
- Yeah, let's do it.

15:39.476 --> 15:42.043
Yeah, we're good.
He's good to go.

15:42.045 --> 15:44.178
His fake ID is terrible.

15:44.180 --> 15:45.580
His ID's terrible.

15:45.582 --> 15:47.216
It works.

16:36.168 --> 16:37.437
Eddie, come here.

16:40.206 --> 16:41.975
Eddie.

16:44.211 --> 16:45.513
This is crazy, man.

16:47.413 --> 16:50.180
Look, if I do this,
I'm part of Hell Gang, right?

16:50.182 --> 16:51.715
Right?

16:51.717 --> 16:54.018
Dude, we have the common
courtesy to reach around

16:54.020 --> 16:55.520
and finish
all of our victims.

16:55.522 --> 16:56.720
Don't worry about it.

16:56.722 --> 16:58.223
Dude, stop moving.

16:58.225 --> 16:59.591
God.

16:59.593 --> 17:01.160
What are you doing?

17:01.162 --> 17:02.762
What are you... Ow!

17:02.764 --> 17:04.696
I'm just making sure
it's not going to come off.

17:04.699 --> 17:07.002
It's not going to come off.
Can we go, please?

17:08.367 --> 17:10.036
All right, when you
hop the fence,

17:10.038 --> 17:12.470
make sure this is facing
your face, and turn this on.

17:12.472 --> 17:14.140
Got it.
You got it?

17:14.142 --> 17:15.807
Yeah. Please, can we
get this over with?

17:15.809 --> 17:17.742
Eddie's ready.

17:17.743 --> 17:20.013
Eddie, do you think you
can accomplish this task?

17:26.387 --> 17:28.055
Watch the barbwire.

17:28.057 --> 17:30.326
Ooh. Look at him go.

17:32.627 --> 17:36.229
- Get up there.
- Pace yourself, buddy.

17:36.231 --> 17:37.830
There you go.

17:42.604 --> 17:44.203
Be here when I get back, okay?

17:44.205 --> 17:46.105
Okay. All right, bro.

17:46.107 --> 17:48.408
All right, guys. Do we think
he's going to actually do it?

17:48.410 --> 17:50.644
- I think he's going to make it.
- Yeah, he's going to make it.

17:50.646 --> 17:52.446
He's moving right along.

17:52.448 --> 17:54.182
So should we
release the hounds?

17:54.184 --> 17:56.584
- He heard that on the video.
- I have more than one.

17:56.586 --> 17:59.119
- Be my guest.
- All right, Muzo,

17:59.121 --> 18:00.587
just do it in profile for me
this time

18:00.589 --> 18:02.423
so I can get a cool shot.

18:02.425 --> 18:04.192
Yes, sir.

18:20.711 --> 18:22.543
Awesome. Very, very good.

18:22.545 --> 18:24.213
That was the best yet.

18:24.215 --> 18:25.646
When he comes down,
I want you to get him

18:25.648 --> 18:27.382
right when he's coming down
the fence, okay?

18:27.384 --> 18:29.184
Ah, damn it.

18:29.186 --> 18:30.422
Not now. Damn it.

18:32.356 --> 18:34.423
- Just act normal.
- Don't worry about it.

18:34.425 --> 18:36.358
- Hide your beers.
- Can't get caught again.

18:36.360 --> 18:37.796
Screw this.
I'm going to the van.

18:40.364 --> 18:42.365
Yo, just be chill.

18:42.367 --> 18:44.233
What's going on tonight, guys?

18:44.235 --> 18:46.168
We're just hanging out, officer.

18:46.170 --> 18:48.206
This is the wrong place
to hang out.

18:52.143 --> 18:54.277
Hey, are you
Dr. Pierce's kid?

18:54.279 --> 18:56.846
- Head of surgery at...
- Memorial Hospital.

18:56.848 --> 18:58.819
- Memorial Hospital, yeah.
- Hey, Officer King.

19:00.719 --> 19:02.785
- Turn the camera off.
- Right. Sorry, officer.

19:02.787 --> 19:04.821
You guys back it up.
Get back by the car.

19:04.823 --> 19:07.291
- How you doing tonight?
- I'm doing well. Yourself?

19:07.293 --> 19:08.492
Good, thank you.

19:08.494 --> 19:10.426
Yeah, it's a little cold out.

19:10.428 --> 19:12.196
Are you going to stay warm?

19:12.198 --> 19:13.664
Richie, Richie, take it.

19:13.666 --> 19:15.398
Do not cut this camera.

19:19.338 --> 19:20.540
Turn.

19:22.240 --> 19:23.941
All right, look,
I know your dad

19:23.943 --> 19:25.877
and I like him a lot.

19:25.879 --> 19:27.678
The man saved the life
of Captain Miller

19:27.680 --> 19:29.246
not that long ago.

19:29.248 --> 19:31.248
I remember him talking
about the shooting.

19:31.250 --> 19:33.517
Yeah? Well, I don't want
to have to call your dad

19:33.519 --> 19:35.754
to tell him he has
to pick you up downtown.

19:35.756 --> 19:37.621
Do your parents know
you're out this late?

19:37.623 --> 19:39.224
They're at a conference
in New York...

19:39.226 --> 19:41.825
- In New York.
- And why are you speaking?

19:41.827 --> 19:43.762
I don't know.

19:43.764 --> 19:45.629
Okay.

19:45.631 --> 19:47.934
I'm willing to overlook
the underaged drinking,

19:47.936 --> 19:50.335
because there isn't much here.

19:50.337 --> 19:52.638
But I can't overlook
you guys trespassing.

19:52.640 --> 19:55.640
So clean up
and clear out now.

19:55.642 --> 19:57.376
- Yes, sir. Absolutely.
- Yup, okay.

19:57.378 --> 19:58.843
Guys, we're going to do that
right now.

19:58.845 --> 20:02.415
If you guys come back down here,
we will take you all in.

20:02.417 --> 20:04.316
- Got it?
- It won't happen.

20:04.318 --> 20:05.817
- Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you.

20:05.819 --> 20:07.753
- Lock it up and clean up.
- Absolutely.

20:07.755 --> 20:09.822
Officer, he's just...
He's just being a clown.

20:09.824 --> 20:11.557
Officer King,
I'll take care of it.

20:11.559 --> 20:12.859
I promise I'll take care of it.

20:12.861 --> 20:14.260
- This is on you.
- Yes, sir.

20:14.262 --> 20:15.528
Yes, sir.
Absolutely.

20:15.530 --> 20:17.397
Seriously?

20:17.399 --> 20:19.902
- Thank you. Thank you.
- Have a good night, guys.

20:22.570 --> 20:25.505
Please tell me
you got that.

20:25.507 --> 20:27.440
I told you I didn't have
a good feeling about this.

20:27.442 --> 20:28.808
Why didn't you listen to me?

20:28.810 --> 20:30.611
No, we could have got
in some serious trouble.

20:30.613 --> 20:31.978
Just be quiet.

20:31.980 --> 20:33.980
Honestly, what are we
supposed to do now?

20:33.982 --> 20:36.383
Are you guys... Are you guys
coming back to get Eddie?

20:36.385 --> 20:37.818
Of course
we are.

20:37.820 --> 20:39.586
As long as he
doesn't get back

20:39.588 --> 20:41.521
while the cops are still here
or while we're gone.

20:41.523 --> 20:44.726
- Yeah. He'll be pissed.
- No, he won't.

20:44.728 --> 20:46.893
If we're back in time,
he won't know the difference.

20:46.895 --> 20:48.895
I'm going to take
Richie and Shrock.

20:48.897 --> 20:50.965
It's late and they're sketch,
I'll get in trouble, so...

20:50.967 --> 20:52.900
- You're gonna bail?
- It's late.

20:52.902 --> 20:55.603
You guys knew how late we were
going, and Eddie's not back yet.

20:55.605 --> 20:56.970
We all agreed to be here.

20:56.972 --> 20:58.941
Dude, I already said
I have to go.

20:58.943 --> 21:00.709
- My parents, okay?
- What about Eddie, though?

21:00.711 --> 21:02.678
You're going to be the first one
to be arrested anyway.

21:02.680 --> 21:04.613
- Let's get out of here.
- Yo, man, it ain't worth it.

21:04.615 --> 21:05.980
Yeah, no, get out of here.

21:05.982 --> 21:07.982
- Go, go, go, go, guys.
- Are you serious?

21:07.984 --> 21:09.985
Sorry we ruined your party.

21:09.987 --> 21:11.854
So it's just the five of us?

21:11.856 --> 21:13.889
You guys said that
you were all going to stay.

21:13.891 --> 21:15.591
Show us the video tomorrow.

21:15.593 --> 21:17.526
We're not going
to show you the video.

21:17.528 --> 21:19.961
I don't know
why we're arguing.

21:19.963 --> 21:23.502
Everybody knew what they were
getting into. This is stupid...

21:25.604 --> 21:26.935
Hey, Keith.

21:26.937 --> 21:28.438
Keith, will you take the camera?

21:28.440 --> 21:30.039
I don't really trust
anybody else,

21:30.041 --> 21:32.375
and I kind of want to be
in the video too, so...

21:32.377 --> 21:33.777
- Yeah.
- Just real quick.

21:33.779 --> 21:35.580
- Just take the flashlight then.
- Yeah.

21:38.684 --> 21:39.883
- You got it?
- Yeah.

21:39.885 --> 21:41.084
All right, cool.

21:41.086 --> 21:42.320
I'm coming.

21:46.390 --> 21:48.024
I trust him.
I trust him with the camera.

21:48.026 --> 21:49.693
Do you?

21:49.695 --> 21:51.695
- Wait, do you trust me?
- No.

21:51.697 --> 21:53.530
That's enough being alone.

21:53.532 --> 21:55.665
Really? Does he
actually want me to answer that?

21:55.667 --> 21:58.402
Okay, this is just too creepy.

21:58.404 --> 22:00.538
Fuck! Damn, dude,

22:00.540 --> 22:02.006
did you have to park
so far away?

22:02.008 --> 22:04.107
Oh, is your head cold,
little guy?

22:04.109 --> 22:06.510
Dude, do you
guys even see Eddie?

22:06.512 --> 22:08.578
No, we don't see Eddie.
I told you he'd do it.

22:08.580 --> 22:11.116
Yeah, but how long is that road?
Quarter mile? Half a mile long?

22:11.118 --> 22:12.650
He's got to be back by now.

22:12.652 --> 22:14.352
Eddie! Eddie!

22:14.354 --> 22:15.820
Maybe he left already.

22:15.822 --> 22:17.422
Dude, if he left with my rig,

22:17.424 --> 22:19.424
I'm going to strangle him
until dead.

22:19.426 --> 22:21.592
Guys, if he's still in
here, we have to go get him.

22:21.594 --> 22:22.627
Chase, you're out of your mind.
I'm not going up there.

22:22.629 --> 22:24.428
Eddie!

22:24.430 --> 22:26.764
Yeah, just give him
some time. He'll be okay.

22:26.766 --> 22:28.767
Eddie!

22:28.769 --> 22:31.569
- Shit, guys.
- What? What? What?

22:31.571 --> 22:33.038
I don't...
What is that?

22:33.040 --> 22:35.006
- Get down, get down.
- Is that cops?

22:35.008 --> 22:37.710
- That's not a cop car.
- Dude, that's Jenny.

22:37.712 --> 22:39.544
It's Jenny's car.

22:39.546 --> 22:41.147
- Hey!
- Shh. Quiet.

22:41.149 --> 22:42.548
What are you doing here?

22:42.550 --> 22:43.782
Are you guys kidding me?

22:43.784 --> 22:45.385
- Austin?
- Austin?

22:45.387 --> 22:47.052
- Austin?
- What?

22:47.054 --> 22:50.956
Did you forget something?
Like, I don't know, batteries?

22:50.958 --> 22:52.992
Oh, my God.

22:52.994 --> 22:54.827
Ah, yes.
Thank you.

22:54.829 --> 22:57.463
That will definitely
come in handy.

22:57.465 --> 22:59.433
Scared the crap out of me.

22:59.435 --> 23:00.934
- Hello.
- Hey.

23:00.936 --> 23:04.103
Where's your car?
I thought you guys left already.

23:04.105 --> 23:05.805
- Don't worry about it.
- How'd you get here?

23:05.807 --> 23:08.108
Well, since we're already here,
can we watch?

23:08.110 --> 23:09.842
No, this is
a Hell Gang thing.

23:09.844 --> 23:11.110
- I told you.
- What? Why not?

23:11.112 --> 23:12.879
Come on,
it's just us.

23:12.881 --> 23:14.782
We're not like all the other
girls at the party.

23:14.784 --> 23:16.783
- No, it doesn't matter.
- We're practically Hell Gang.

23:16.785 --> 23:18.819
Practically isn't officially,
so no.

23:18.821 --> 23:20.454
You're just jealous,
Lucas.

23:20.456 --> 23:22.054
Yeah, I think she's right,
Lucas.

23:22.056 --> 23:24.158
I think you have a little
third wheel syndrome going on.

23:24.160 --> 23:26.060
Well, you have a little
unusual syndrome going on.

23:26.062 --> 23:27.528
Look, man,
they're already here.

23:27.530 --> 23:29.496
Just let them stay
for a little bit.

23:29.498 --> 23:31.666
Dude, Eddie's your friend, man.
He's been in there way too long.

23:31.668 --> 23:33.033
Why do you not care
about getting him?

23:33.035 --> 23:34.936
I do care about him,
I just...

23:34.938 --> 23:36.204
He's a big boy, and I don't
think we need to hurry.

23:36.206 --> 23:37.472
What, are you scared all of the
sudden?

23:37.474 --> 23:38.672
I'm not scared.

23:38.674 --> 23:40.841
I just have
better things to do.

23:40.843 --> 23:42.043
- Hey.
- Ow.

23:42.045 --> 23:43.511
I'm not a thing.

23:43.513 --> 23:44.912
But you can do me.

23:44.914 --> 23:46.480
Oh, nice.

23:48.486 --> 23:51.656
Austin. Dude, man, I'm serious.
He's been in there way too long.

23:53.825 --> 23:55.925
Just five minutes.

23:55.927 --> 23:58.627
Can I shoot stuff on the camera
while we wait?

23:58.629 --> 24:01.596
- Sure.
- Okay, okay. All right.

24:01.598 --> 24:04.533
- Five minutes, okay?
- All right. I got it.

24:04.535 --> 24:05.935
I got it.

24:05.937 --> 24:08.169
- So you forgot this?
- Yeah, thank you.

24:08.171 --> 24:10.974
I thought you would
forget it.

24:10.976 --> 24:12.641
I know,
I know, I know.

24:12.643 --> 24:14.744
Does Eddie
have your rig on?

24:14.746 --> 24:16.246
Yeah. It's...

24:16.248 --> 24:18.047
How many times have I told you
to buy a remote?

24:18.049 --> 24:19.748
Then you can see
where he is.

24:19.750 --> 24:21.250
You know I got to save up
for film school.

24:21.252 --> 24:22.919
I mean,
it's not that cheap.

24:22.921 --> 24:25.622
Can we not talk about
film school for a second?

24:25.624 --> 24:27.224
It's not even going to be
that far away, okay?

24:27.226 --> 24:29.659
Yeah, but I'm going to miss you
and it sucks.

24:29.661 --> 24:31.928
- Listen, we are going to be okay.
- Okay, this is boring.

24:31.930 --> 24:33.662
- I'm going to move on.
- Oh, really? Boring?

24:33.664 --> 24:35.165
- Shut up, Chase.
- Excellent.

24:35.167 --> 24:36.834
I'm glad we're boring you
with my life.

24:36.836 --> 24:38.236
- It's just my life.
- Chase, come here.

24:38.238 --> 24:40.604
Listen, I really think
that we should just

24:40.606 --> 24:42.073
wait out here for Eddie.

24:42.075 --> 24:44.040
And when he gets here,
we can leave and go home.

24:44.042 --> 24:46.177
- Keith, we're going.
- There's no point in us going.

24:46.179 --> 24:48.712
Unless you want to be the
only one out here by yourself...

24:48.714 --> 24:50.780
- You're done here. You're a dick.
- You serious?

24:50.782 --> 24:53.553
Muzo, come on. Let's go.

24:56.522 --> 24:58.856
Please don't
go in there.

24:58.858 --> 25:00.726
What? Why?

25:00.728 --> 25:02.928
I don't know. It's...

25:02.930 --> 25:05.162
it's not a good idea.

25:05.164 --> 25:06.964
Muzo, come on.
We're waiting on you.

25:06.966 --> 25:08.232
It's a fine idea.
It's just Eddie.

25:08.234 --> 25:09.934
Eddie's just trying
to mess with us.

25:09.936 --> 25:11.836
- Tick-tock, buddy.
- We're going to be fine.

25:11.838 --> 25:13.271
- Guaranteed.
- You don't look so convinced.

25:13.273 --> 25:15.274
You look scared.

25:15.276 --> 25:17.209
I'm not scared.

25:17.211 --> 25:18.947
It's going to be fine.

25:22.249 --> 25:24.049
Use your head.
I'm telling you, use your head.

25:24.051 --> 25:27.052
So, can we go?
Pretty, pretty please?

25:27.054 --> 25:28.954
No. No, Jenny, no.

25:28.956 --> 25:30.623
Come on.
No.

25:30.625 --> 25:32.291
Wow, seriously?
Yes.

25:32.293 --> 25:34.327
Seriously, we don't need you
getting scared and, like,

25:34.329 --> 25:36.095
grabbing on to all of us.

25:36.097 --> 25:38.030
Oh, that's for you.

25:38.032 --> 25:39.566
I don't want you.

25:39.568 --> 25:41.033
Okay, listen, listen, listen.

25:41.035 --> 25:42.902
Girls, girls, girl.

25:42.904 --> 25:44.737
We're just going in there.
We're getting Eddie,

25:44.739 --> 25:46.306
we're getting the footage
so we can post it,

25:46.308 --> 25:48.341
- and we're coming right back.
- Okay. Cool. Go.

25:48.343 --> 25:50.711
It's not a big deal. We'll call
you when we get to the car.

25:50.713 --> 25:52.046
Fine.
Good?

25:52.048 --> 25:53.981
- Let's go, dude. Come on.
- I'm coming.

25:53.983 --> 25:57.216
Are we going? Are we going?

25:57.218 --> 26:00.087
I'll leave the headlights on
until you guys go in.

26:00.089 --> 26:01.754
Thank you.

26:01.756 --> 26:02.958
Go.

26:06.896 --> 26:08.662
Go.

26:11.301 --> 26:13.236
- Bye, babe. Love you.
- Let's do this!

26:15.138 --> 26:19.741
Is he already over there?
Get over there, Chase.

26:19.743 --> 26:22.042
- All right, you got it.
- I got this.

26:22.044 --> 26:24.044
- Do you, though?
- I do.

26:24.046 --> 26:25.981
I got it.

26:25.983 --> 26:28.883
It's like watching a
bull trying to climb a fence.

26:28.885 --> 26:30.955
Ha! A very agile bull.

26:33.956 --> 26:36.291
- Good job.
- Hey, Chase, Chase.

26:36.293 --> 26:38.793
Chase, take the camera,
because I'm going to do it,

26:38.795 --> 26:40.763
and I'm going to do it
way faster than all you guys.

26:40.765 --> 26:42.298
- And I want that on record.
- Oh! Yeah, okay.

26:42.300 --> 26:43.799
I'm going to cream you guys.

26:43.801 --> 26:45.037
All right, all right,
all right.

26:46.870 --> 26:48.803
All right, you boys.
Are you watching this?

26:48.805 --> 26:50.138
Make it over, parkour-style.

26:50.140 --> 26:51.340
All right.

26:51.342 --> 26:52.974
Oh, yeah!

26:52.976 --> 26:54.409
- Look at you.
- Here he goes.

26:57.215 --> 26:59.349
Come on, I'm stuck.
No, seriously.

26:59.351 --> 27:01.251
No, seriously,
I'm stuck.

27:01.253 --> 27:03.754
I don't think you
made it over faster.

27:03.756 --> 27:05.321
Is Kimmie going to get mad?

27:05.323 --> 27:07.090
Are you...
Is Kimmie...

27:07.092 --> 27:09.091
I'm good.

27:09.093 --> 27:11.395
- Guys? Guys?
- Oh, come on.

27:11.397 --> 27:13.830
No, just stop, please.

27:13.832 --> 27:15.799
Just give me the camera.
Just give me the camera.

27:15.801 --> 27:18.838
- No, no, wait...
- Keith, dude, Keith.

27:20.272 --> 27:22.171
Feeling all right?
All right.

27:22.173 --> 27:24.277
Just... Here. Thanks.

27:27.814 --> 27:29.980
All right, I got it.

27:29.982 --> 27:31.918
All right, boys.
Here we go.

27:33.385 --> 27:35.419
Oh, shit.

27:35.421 --> 27:38.755
- Come on!
- Yo, watch out.

27:38.757 --> 27:40.858
- Hey, watch out, man.
- Come on!

27:40.860 --> 27:42.459
It's so dark, I can't even see.

27:42.461 --> 27:44.094
Yo, we are such dicks.

27:44.096 --> 27:46.465
We didn't even give Eddie
a flashlight.

27:46.467 --> 27:48.167
You didn't me
a flashlight, either.

27:48.169 --> 27:49.435
Eddie!

27:49.437 --> 27:51.969
Come on, Eddie!

27:51.971 --> 27:53.171
Hey, Keith.

27:53.173 --> 27:55.440
You okay?

27:55.442 --> 27:57.308
- Dude, let me ask you something.
- What?

27:57.310 --> 27:59.277
Why'd you get so mad when
everybody was talking about

27:59.279 --> 28:01.112
- those ghost stories?
- 'Cause it pisses me off

28:01.114 --> 28:03.215
that you guys use the Internet
to look at these stupid videos,

28:03.217 --> 28:04.483
but don't take the time
to research

28:04.485 --> 28:06.051
what actually happened
to the house.

28:06.053 --> 28:07.452
Yeah, but you know that's just

28:07.454 --> 28:09.353
because it's more fun
that way.

28:09.355 --> 28:11.857
Those stories have been around
a lot longer than the Internet.

28:11.859 --> 28:13.459
Yeah, Austin,
I get it, okay?

28:13.461 --> 28:16.729
But I just feel like if I was
the one living back then,

28:16.731 --> 28:18.465
I would have painted pictures
on the rock wall

28:18.467 --> 28:19.998
of what actually happened,
that's all.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.468
Hey, dude. Me too. No doubt.

28:21.470 --> 28:23.135
I completely agree.

28:23.137 --> 28:26.171
But, like... but, like,
you did research on it?

28:26.173 --> 28:27.474
Yeah.

28:27.476 --> 28:29.042
- You know what happened?
- Yeah.

28:29.044 --> 28:30.910
And haunted or not,

28:30.912 --> 28:33.813
it's not what actually happened
up there that makes it so sick.

28:33.815 --> 28:36.750
Yo, are you saying you know
what happened in the house?

28:36.752 --> 28:37.951
Yes. I just said that.

28:37.953 --> 28:39.787
- Yo, yo, guys!
- Austin...

28:39.789 --> 28:41.489
Keith knows the truth about what
happened in the house.

28:41.491 --> 28:43.089
- Dude, tell us.
- Yeah, what is it?

28:43.091 --> 28:44.758
- What's the story?
- Come on, man.

28:44.760 --> 28:46.360
Yo, dude, you'll be fine.

28:46.362 --> 28:48.328
Seriously? You had
that light this whole time?

28:48.330 --> 28:50.131
Yeah, dude. It was in my bag.

28:50.133 --> 28:52.066
Austin, that's really bright.
Can you turn it down?

28:52.068 --> 28:53.433
Will you just go?
Just go. Seriously.

28:53.435 --> 28:55.335
All right, like I said,
it's not a story.

28:55.337 --> 28:58.240
It's just this thing I found
on this website

28:58.242 --> 29:00.142
when we first started talking
about bringing Billy

29:00.144 --> 29:01.175
- up to the mansion.
- Okay, yeah.

29:01.177 --> 29:02.410
So, what is it?

29:02.412 --> 29:04.045
Just police reports
and pictures.

29:04.047 --> 29:06.347
And according to one
of the police reports,

29:06.349 --> 29:09.084
Lady Brandt and her children
went up to church every Sunday.

29:09.086 --> 29:10.885
So, one Sunday when
they didn't show up,

29:10.887 --> 29:12.854
you know, a neighbor of theirs
got a little nervous

29:12.856 --> 29:15.156
because she was about to have
her 13th child.

29:15.158 --> 29:17.092
She was, you know,
almost due.

29:17.094 --> 29:19.227
And, uh, they had the cops go up
there and check it out.

29:19.229 --> 29:21.163
And when the cops walked in,
they found Lady Brandt

29:21.165 --> 29:23.566
and her children
dead in the nursery.

29:23.568 --> 29:25.300
All of them.

29:25.302 --> 29:27.170
You know, and they didn't
have forensics and CSI

29:27.172 --> 29:29.305
like we have now,
so they didn't know how she died

29:29.307 --> 29:32.174
or how long she'd been dead
or who even killed her.

29:32.176 --> 29:33.408
The only thing
they knew for sure

29:33.410 --> 29:36.145
was that Mr. Brandt
was missing.

29:36.147 --> 29:39.281
And look, you know I've seen some
really bloody murder scenes.

29:39.283 --> 29:41.317
I showed you the...
The Wonderland photos.

29:41.319 --> 29:42.984
- Yeah.
- You know?

29:42.986 --> 29:44.886
Nothing compares to these
black-and-white photos

29:44.888 --> 29:46.322
that were in
this police report.

29:46.324 --> 29:48.157
I mean, were they, like...
were they hacked up?

29:48.159 --> 29:49.492
I mean,
like the kids?

29:49.494 --> 29:51.127
I've seen the Lizzie Borden
videos.

29:51.129 --> 29:52.896
- No, no, no. It wasn't like...
- And pictures.

29:52.898 --> 29:54.231
No, it wasn't like that.

29:54.233 --> 29:56.098
No, it wasn't
anything like that.

29:56.100 --> 29:57.901
It wasn't gory at all.
There wasn't any blood.

29:57.903 --> 29:59.302
It was like...
what are you doing?

29:59.304 --> 30:01.171
I'm just zooming in.
Keep going.

30:01.173 --> 30:03.373
It wasn't... There wasn't blood
or anything like that.

30:03.375 --> 30:05.509
There were wounds, you know, because
they'd been murdered, obviously.

30:05.511 --> 30:08.578
But there was, like...
I don't know.

30:08.580 --> 30:11.482
It was the sick bastard, he...

30:11.484 --> 30:14.319
it's like he killed...
He killed his own family,

30:14.321 --> 30:16.320
and then he...
And then he cleaned them up.

30:16.322 --> 30:18.322
And the most
disturbing part...

30:18.324 --> 30:20.059
the most disturbing part
was that he, like...

30:21.962 --> 30:23.994
he posed them.

30:23.996 --> 30:26.330
Posed them?
Like mannequins?

30:26.332 --> 30:29.900
Yeah, yeah, kind of like
mannequins, man.

30:31.972 --> 30:33.538
I don't know.

30:33.540 --> 30:36.242
Lady Brandt, I mean,
she was like in a rocking chair.

30:36.244 --> 30:38.377
And all of her children were
just sitting in front of her.

30:38.379 --> 30:40.512
Kind of like remember when
we were in Miss Carter's class

30:40.514 --> 30:42.481
when we were growing up,
and she read us story time?

30:42.483 --> 30:44.116
Sure, sure, yeah.

30:44.118 --> 30:46.051
They were all sitting in
front of her cross-legged,

30:46.053 --> 30:48.387
just waiting for their mother
to tell them a bedtime story.

30:48.389 --> 30:52.957
But instead of a book in her
hand, she had her 13th child.

30:52.959 --> 30:54.359
Sitting right there
in her lap.

30:54.361 --> 30:55.994
Seriously?

30:55.996 --> 30:58.264
And you want to know
the most disturbing part?

30:58.266 --> 31:02.002
The umbilical cord was still
attached to the baby and her.

31:02.004 --> 31:04.337
I don't know
if the baby was stillborn

31:04.339 --> 31:07.940
or if that sick freak
left it attached

31:07.942 --> 31:09.408
so that when she died
the baby died.

31:09.410 --> 31:12.611
But I can't...

31:12.613 --> 31:15.581
I can't get that image
out of my head.

31:15.583 --> 31:17.516
It's just, like.
Burnt in there forever.

31:17.518 --> 31:21.655
I mean, the looks on these
poor kids' faces, man.

31:21.657 --> 31:23.861
It's like they died really bad,
you know?

31:26.595 --> 31:28.629
Look, I don't mind that
we're going up to the mansion.

31:28.631 --> 31:31.064
In fact, I hope Eddie is okay.
But I just...

31:31.066 --> 31:34.101
you guys got to promise me
if we go in the house, I-I-I...

31:34.103 --> 31:35.602
We cannot go up to the nursery,
okay?

31:35.604 --> 31:37.237
- I can't do it.
- Sure. Yeah.

31:37.239 --> 31:38.605
Promise me that, because...

31:38.607 --> 31:40.344
- What was that?
- What was that?

31:41.710 --> 31:43.311
Shh.

31:43.313 --> 31:45.282
- Get the camera.
- Guys, shut up.

31:52.122 --> 31:54.158
Guys, shut up.

31:55.659 --> 31:57.526
Dude, I think that...

31:57.528 --> 31:59.264
Dude, I think it's kind of...

32:06.470 --> 32:09.237
Damn it! Damn it!

32:09.239 --> 32:10.605
- Goddamn it, dude.
- Muzo!

32:10.607 --> 32:12.342
- God, you dick!
- I got you guys.

32:12.344 --> 32:14.277
That was not cool, dude.
That was not cool.

32:14.279 --> 32:16.144
- Not cool.
- Not cool at all.

32:16.146 --> 32:18.081
- Guys, it was just a joke.
- Dude, no.

32:18.083 --> 32:19.548
- No, that was a dick move.
- Not funny, man.

32:19.550 --> 32:21.284
Jesus Christ.

32:21.286 --> 32:23.152
You know Keith
is already freaking out.

32:23.154 --> 32:25.721
- Hey, I'm just joking.
- Dude, not a joke.

32:25.723 --> 32:28.757
Keith, come on, man.
Don't get too far ahead.

32:28.759 --> 32:30.226
Come on, dude.

32:30.228 --> 32:32.298
Hey, you know,
I'm really sorry.

32:33.765 --> 32:35.598
Hey, I'm going to need some help

32:35.600 --> 32:37.369
getting down there
with this camera.

32:39.137 --> 32:40.770
Here, hand it to me.

32:40.772 --> 32:42.405
Yeah, I'd rather not.

32:42.407 --> 32:43.707
Just give me a hand.

32:43.709 --> 32:45.308
How about you turn
that light back on?

32:45.310 --> 32:47.076
No, it's killing the battery.

32:47.078 --> 32:48.746
Hey, Chase, can we have
a little bro talk real quick?

32:48.748 --> 32:50.381
Sure.

32:50.383 --> 32:51.781
Um. What is
up with you and Jenny?

32:51.783 --> 32:53.552
- What about her?
- Because she...

32:56.254 --> 32:58.022
- Dude. Damn, dude.
- Ah, shit.

32:58.024 --> 32:59.289
Yo, are you all right, Keith?

32:59.291 --> 33:00.525
Yeah, take the flashlight.

33:00.527 --> 33:02.059
Are you good?

33:02.061 --> 33:04.029
Yo, yo,
check that out.

33:04.031 --> 33:05.596
Are you getting this?
Check this out.

33:05.598 --> 33:07.198
Yo, dude, that's freaky.

33:07.200 --> 33:09.366
- That's freaky.
- All right...

33:09.368 --> 33:11.236
We're getting close
to the house, I guess.

33:11.238 --> 33:13.270
All right, come on.
Austin, is the camera all right?

33:13.272 --> 33:15.406
Yeah, man, it's fine.
Let's just get out of here.

33:15.408 --> 33:16.775
I don't really
like this place.

33:16.777 --> 33:18.375
This place is creepy.

33:18.377 --> 33:20.310
Dude, we have three flashlights.

33:20.312 --> 33:22.481
We didn't give Eddie one.
It's still pitch-black out here.

33:22.483 --> 33:23.482
I feel bad for sending
Eddie out here by himself.

33:23.484 --> 33:25.317
Eddie!

33:25.319 --> 33:27.453
I'm starting to feel
really bad for Billy, man.

33:27.455 --> 33:28.753
No one gave him a flashlight?

33:28.755 --> 33:30.489
We didn't give him a flashlight.

33:30.491 --> 33:32.223
We have three
and it's still dark.

33:32.225 --> 33:33.425
That was kind of
a dick move on our part.

33:33.427 --> 33:35.560
He had that light
on his camera.

33:35.562 --> 33:37.829
- Yeah?
- Yo, guys,

33:37.831 --> 33:40.433
there's nothing up...
Oh, my God!

33:40.435 --> 33:42.768
- Dude. Damn, guys.
- Okay, enough, man.

33:42.770 --> 33:44.703
Enough!

33:44.705 --> 33:46.673
What the hell was that for?
You're an asshole.

33:46.675 --> 33:48.774
- Enough! Stop. Stop.
- That's what I get for what?

33:48.776 --> 33:51.278
- Messing with Keith.
- Stop. Just stop.

33:51.280 --> 33:52.479
That's enough, man.

33:52.481 --> 33:54.548
- How old are we?
- Shut up, Austin.

33:54.550 --> 33:56.582
Dude... Stop.
Let's go find Eddie.

33:56.584 --> 33:58.752
You guys are acting like
children, man. Let's just go.

33:58.754 --> 34:01.521
Watch out for this right here.

34:01.523 --> 34:04.357
- Can you see anything?
- No, I can't.

34:04.359 --> 34:06.358
- It's really narrow.
- Watch out.

34:06.360 --> 34:07.793
Keith, you doing all right?

34:07.795 --> 34:09.862
Muzo, watch out right there.

34:09.864 --> 34:12.500
- You good?
- Yeah.

34:12.502 --> 34:15.402
Dude, tell me if I'm about...

34:15.404 --> 34:17.205
Oh, shit! It's Eddie!

34:17.206 --> 34:18.505
It's Eddie!

34:18.507 --> 34:20.241
No, no, it's not Eddie.

34:20.243 --> 34:22.275
It's not Eddie. Shit.

34:22.277 --> 34:23.781
What's going on? What? What?

34:25.482 --> 34:27.248
- Ow, my leg.
- You all right?

34:27.250 --> 34:29.183
- God, that smells terrible.
- Oh, that stinks.

34:29.185 --> 34:31.185
No, dude, don't touch it.
Don't touch it.

34:31.187 --> 34:33.320
Yeah, dude. That
thing's been dead for weeks.

34:33.322 --> 34:34.755
I wonder what killed
that thing.

34:34.757 --> 34:37.693
Dude, we got to move.
That smells terrible.

34:37.695 --> 34:40.264
- You all right?
- Ugh! Come on, Chase.

34:42.900 --> 34:44.364
Come on, Chase.

34:44.367 --> 34:45.800
I think I see something.

34:45.802 --> 34:47.505
I think it's that pool.

34:48.670 --> 34:50.638
You see that sign?

34:50.639 --> 34:52.672
Dude, well we're
either going in or we're not.

34:52.675 --> 34:54.208
Well, they're going in.

34:54.210 --> 34:55.513
I'm terrified.

34:56.914 --> 34:58.480
Watch your step.

34:58.482 --> 35:00.650
I always watch my step.

35:02.620 --> 35:04.821
- Careful.
- I'm sorry. Sorry.

35:04.823 --> 35:06.656
Hey, Luke, slow down, man...

35:06.658 --> 35:08.360
Austin, come
check this out.

35:09.828 --> 35:11.661
Well, it's kind of demonic.

35:11.663 --> 35:13.496
I feel like I've
seen that face before.

35:13.498 --> 35:15.397
Yeah, I know what you mean.

35:15.399 --> 35:17.766
It's creepy.

35:19.738 --> 35:21.670
- Are you cold?
- Yeah, yeah, I'm cold.

35:21.672 --> 35:23.610
Dude, I'm not going over there.

35:30.249 --> 35:32.916
You going? You going in?

35:32.918 --> 35:34.918
I think I'm going
to stay up here.

35:34.920 --> 35:36.686
- You sure?
- Yeah.

35:36.688 --> 35:38.655
You want to take my flashlight?
I'll take the camera.

35:38.657 --> 35:40.490
Sure. Just be careful.

35:40.492 --> 35:41.728
- I will.
- Please?

35:43.262 --> 35:44.631
- Got it?
- Yeah, yeah. Got it.

35:47.334 --> 35:48.602
Be careful.

35:51.471 --> 35:53.872
Oh, my God.

35:53.874 --> 35:56.640
Oh my God, guys.
I think this is blood.

35:56.642 --> 35:58.609
What?

35:58.611 --> 36:00.615
I think I just found blood
down here.

36:03.350 --> 36:04.915
That's totally blood.

36:04.917 --> 36:06.685
- Don't touch it!
- Don't touch it!

36:06.687 --> 36:08.252
That's, like,
fresh blood.

36:08.254 --> 36:10.759
Yo, Keith, turn off
my camera light, man.

36:16.663 --> 36:18.496
Nothing.

36:18.498 --> 36:20.499
All right. Come on, guys.
Let's go.

36:20.501 --> 36:23.001
Oh, there he is.

36:49.531 --> 36:51.267
Hey, guys?

36:55.671 --> 36:57.506
You know
there's no way out.

36:58.775 --> 36:59.974
Billy?

36:59.976 --> 37:01.608
Austin, come on.

37:01.610 --> 37:02.976
Billy?

37:02.978 --> 37:05.445
Hey, come on, man.
Let's go.

37:05.447 --> 37:06.716
You okay?

37:09.286 --> 37:10.854
Yeah.

37:18.661 --> 37:20.930
- Goddamn.
- Shit.

37:22.533 --> 37:24.365
What? What is it?

37:24.367 --> 37:25.801
Dude, don't pick up stuff,
man.

37:25.803 --> 37:28.636
We got to be
getting close, right?

37:28.638 --> 37:30.004
Oh, shit...

37:30.006 --> 37:31.640
I want to go home.

37:31.642 --> 37:33.776
Hot shower.

37:33.778 --> 37:35.678
Yo, it is cold out here.

37:35.680 --> 37:37.412
I think we're almost there.

37:37.414 --> 37:38.747
Oh, shit, guys, guys, look.

37:38.749 --> 37:41.450
Austin, this is the shot.

37:41.452 --> 37:44.486
- Shit.
- Come here and get this.

37:48.025 --> 37:49.958
This place is... Whoa.

37:49.960 --> 37:51.795
Did you see that?

37:51.797 --> 37:54.531
- Are you serious?
- That's got to be Eddie.

37:54.533 --> 37:57.366
Why would Eddie
be in the nursery?

37:57.368 --> 38:00.372
Yo, I don't think
Eddie would go in there.

38:04.076 --> 38:06.009
Look how far
back this house goes.

38:06.011 --> 38:07.880
What the hell?

38:10.582 --> 38:12.450
- You see something?
- Dude, let's be real.

38:12.452 --> 38:14.117
I'm exhausted.

38:14.119 --> 38:16.486
I thought I saw someone
walking around the corner.

38:16.488 --> 38:18.655
- You didn't see it?
- Probably just a shadow.

38:18.657 --> 38:19.990
Yeah, I'm just tired.

38:19.992 --> 38:21.758
- Austin!
- What?

38:21.760 --> 38:23.494
Look what I found.

38:23.496 --> 38:24.961
Dude, is that my rig?

38:24.963 --> 38:26.463
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

38:26.465 --> 38:27.832
Are you kidding me?

38:27.834 --> 38:29.966
Muzo, come hold this.

38:29.968 --> 38:31.338
Damn.

38:32.738 --> 38:34.641
Shine the light
right here.

38:37.844 --> 38:39.745
Oh, shit. The door.

38:39.747 --> 38:41.415
Dude, what are you...?

38:52.725 --> 38:54.125
- You want to go in?
- No.

38:54.127 --> 38:55.527
Austin?

38:55.529 --> 38:56.862
Uh... yeah, what?

38:56.864 --> 38:58.131
It looks like it's still on,

38:58.133 --> 38:59.798
but the memory card's full.

38:59.800 --> 39:01.166
Yeah, well it's probably because

39:01.168 --> 39:02.869
he, like, had it running
the entire time,

39:02.871 --> 39:04.771
so he just drained
the entire card.

39:04.773 --> 39:06.972
And I didn't bring another one
for that camera.

39:06.974 --> 39:09.809
You guys want to at
least watch what's on it?

39:09.811 --> 39:11.910
- We can, can't we?
- Not a bad idea.

39:11.912 --> 39:13.746
Yeah, no, we can.

39:13.748 --> 39:16.148
Chase, if you grab the monitor
out of my pack, we can watch it.

39:16.150 --> 39:17.885
Yeah, all right.

39:26.729 --> 39:28.728
You remember
how to do it, right?

39:28.730 --> 39:30.566
I think so.

39:37.806 --> 39:39.709
Ready?
Yeah.

39:51.221 --> 39:53.757
Dude, he looks
terrified.

39:55.625 --> 39:56.927
What's that?

39:58.795 --> 40:01.496
Yo, rewind it, so we can
see what scared him.

40:01.498 --> 40:03.768
No, no, I want to see
what happens to the guy.

40:08.871 --> 40:10.805
Looks like he's
running from something.

40:10.807 --> 40:12.607
Yeah, what the
hell is he running from?

40:12.609 --> 40:14.044
I don't know.

40:16.881 --> 40:18.583
<i>No, no, no.</i>

40:23.921 --> 40:25.921
Sounds like he's
being chased or something.

40:25.923 --> 40:27.790
- Yeah.
- <i>Get off me!</i>

40:27.792 --> 40:29.258
<i>Get off me!</i>

40:32.964 --> 40:34.530
Did he fall?

40:34.532 --> 40:35.931
No, he's up here on the porch.

40:35.933 --> 40:37.266
Yeah, he's on the porch.

40:37.268 --> 40:38.969
Yeah, I told you he'd do it.

40:38.971 --> 40:40.871
I don't understand.
So where is he?

40:40.873 --> 40:42.771
He's probably hiding
around here somewhere

40:42.773 --> 40:44.507
just waiting to jump out
and scare us.

40:44.509 --> 40:46.009
No, that's the door.

40:46.011 --> 40:47.744
He's standing
right where we are.

40:47.746 --> 40:49.014
<i>Guys, I'm here.</i>

40:50.815 --> 40:53.516
<i>Guys, I did it, okay?
Guys, I did it.</i>

40:53.518 --> 40:55.552
<i>I'm your number four...</i>

40:55.554 --> 40:56.786
What the fuck?

40:56.788 --> 40:59.022
Oh, shit.

40:59.024 --> 41:00.660
What the hell is that?

41:05.999 --> 41:07.999
Um... uh...

41:08.001 --> 41:10.133
That's it.
That's all we have.

41:10.135 --> 41:12.102
- That's it?
- What does that...?

41:12.104 --> 41:14.638
I don't get it. Where the hell...
Where the hell is he at?

41:14.640 --> 41:15.839
Yeah, um...

41:15.841 --> 41:17.542
All right, you know what?

41:17.544 --> 41:19.243
He probably just
did this with the door

41:19.245 --> 41:20.711
and then held the camera
like that

41:20.713 --> 41:23.081
and made it seem like
that happened.

41:23.083 --> 41:25.250
I mean... I mean, I
guess that kind of makes sense.

41:25.252 --> 41:29.154
Like, it was a little convenient
how we just kinda found my rig

41:29.156 --> 41:31.123
like, in the middle of the open
on the porch.

41:31.125 --> 41:33.025
- Exactly. Exactly.
- But, I mean...

41:33.027 --> 41:35.726
Right? I mean, like, he
said he was gonna mess with us.

41:35.728 --> 41:37.094
Yeah. Yeah.
Right?

41:37.096 --> 41:38.630
Yeah, he did say that.

41:38.632 --> 41:40.165
No, that's exactly what he did.

41:40.167 --> 41:42.067
He was standing on the porch,
he dropped the rig,

41:42.069 --> 41:44.201
and then he left it exactly
where we would find it.

41:44.203 --> 41:46.138
This little shit's
trying to mess with us.

41:46.140 --> 41:48.941
Yeah, he's good,
but he's not that good.

41:48.943 --> 41:51.144
Like, this is what
we're gonna do.

41:51.146 --> 41:53.680
Here, Austin, hold this.
Take this back.

41:53.682 --> 41:55.184
All right, all right...

41:56.684 --> 41:58.318
You three go
through the front.

41:58.320 --> 42:00.053
Austin, you and I
go around the back.

42:00.055 --> 42:01.988
We'll meet in the middle
and then try to scare him

42:01.990 --> 42:03.622
- and get it on camera.
- Hell, yeah.

42:03.624 --> 42:05.224
Wait, wait, wait.

42:05.226 --> 42:07.193
Let's just go in there
and get him and then go home.

42:07.195 --> 42:09.227
That was the plan, that was
the whole reason we came.

42:09.229 --> 42:11.130
We're here, we might as well
take advantage of it.

42:11.132 --> 42:13.266
Chase, Chase,
fine, get your footage.

42:13.268 --> 42:16.103
But don't forget that we came
here to get Eddie and go home.

42:16.105 --> 42:18.371
All right? I'm done with this
video shit, all right? I just...

42:18.373 --> 42:20.206
We're going to get him,
but, like, why not have some fun

42:20.208 --> 42:22.109
in the process
and get some footage?

42:22.111 --> 42:24.243
If it happens, it happens.
Come on, you're gonna be fine.

42:24.245 --> 42:25.813
Dude, you're going to be fine.

42:25.815 --> 42:27.246
- I just want to go home.
- No, I know.

42:27.248 --> 42:28.915
We'll go home as soon
as we get Eddie.

42:28.917 --> 42:32.118
- Austin, take this.
- Oh, yeah, thank you.

42:32.120 --> 42:33.957
Come on, Keith.

42:36.392 --> 42:37.728
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

42:39.396 --> 42:41.262
The lights aren't
working down here, man.

42:41.264 --> 42:43.765
What? But the
light was on upstairs.

42:43.767 --> 42:45.133
I... I know.

42:45.135 --> 42:46.671
What's going on?

42:50.106 --> 42:52.073
- Hey, bro.
- What?

42:52.075 --> 42:55.075
Why don't you go,
like, talk to him real quick?

42:55.077 --> 42:57.014
He's really nervous.

43:00.084 --> 43:01.719
Hey, Eddie...

43:04.689 --> 43:06.721
I just don't think it's a good
idea to go in there.

43:06.723 --> 43:09.792
I think we should just... I think
we should just stay out here.

43:12.964 --> 43:14.830
Dude, we're fine.
It's fine.

43:14.832 --> 43:18.167
It's fine, all right?
Look, we're together.

43:18.169 --> 43:20.069
You have to remember
it's just a house.

43:20.071 --> 43:21.871
All right?
It's just a house.

43:21.873 --> 43:23.706
I know it's just a house,
but you can't tell me

43:23.708 --> 43:25.441
that you think it's a good idea
that we go in there.

43:25.443 --> 43:28.045
- It doesn't feel right.
- It doesn't matter how it feels.

43:28.047 --> 43:29.945
It's fun. We're all together.
It's an empty house.

43:29.947 --> 43:31.914
Nothing's gonna
happen, all right?

43:31.916 --> 43:34.184
Nothing's gonna
happen.

43:34.186 --> 43:36.789
Muzo, come here.

43:39.925 --> 43:41.691
Stay with him.

43:41.693 --> 43:43.325
Jesus Christ.

43:43.327 --> 43:45.095
Come on, Keith.

43:45.097 --> 43:47.201
Just go around the back and just
meet us in the back, okay?

43:50.069 --> 43:51.939
Yeah, I know.
I know. It's Keith.

43:58.178 --> 44:00.944
Wow. Look at this place.

44:00.946 --> 44:02.348
This is creepy.

44:04.149 --> 44:06.350
Yeah, um, next time
let's take the front door...

44:06.352 --> 44:08.752
Dude, shine that
light back over there.

44:08.754 --> 44:10.190
Shine the light... Dude?

44:12.358 --> 44:13.895
Yeah.

44:15.295 --> 44:16.830
What are you doing?

44:18.799 --> 44:21.036
I think this is the root
cellar they were talking about.

44:25.371 --> 44:26.905
Let's go down there.

44:26.907 --> 44:28.507
No, man, come on. Let's go.

44:28.509 --> 44:30.509
Why not?

44:30.511 --> 44:33.312
Yo, I don't want to
go down there, man. Come on.

44:33.314 --> 44:35.251
- You serious?
- Yeah.

44:57.071 --> 44:59.308
It's so dark,
I can't see anything.

45:07.784 --> 45:09.152
It's unlocked.

45:24.334 --> 45:26.504
Wow, look at this thing.

45:27.905 --> 45:29.107
It's massive.

45:31.207 --> 45:33.341
Yo, what, what is that?

45:33.343 --> 45:35.142
Imagine having
to chop down a tree

45:35.144 --> 45:36.845
and start a fire
just to make breakfast.

45:36.847 --> 45:38.513
Yo, just, just
keep your voice down.

45:38.515 --> 45:39.850
Chase, keep your voice down.

45:42.052 --> 45:43.954
No wonder Mr. Brandt
went crazy.

45:51.929 --> 45:54.165
Chase, do you not hear that?

46:06.411 --> 46:08.147
Oh, this is creepy.

46:09.380 --> 46:10.949
Yo, what are you doing?

46:16.255 --> 46:18.521
I think that's the root cellar.

46:18.523 --> 46:20.122
Ugh!

46:20.124 --> 46:21.959
Oh, it smells
like dry rot in there.

46:21.961 --> 46:23.526
Yo, I don't
want to go down there.

46:23.528 --> 46:26.166
Oh, it's like the rest
of this house, but worse.

46:35.107 --> 46:36.410
What?

46:38.645 --> 46:41.081
Come on.
Are you serious?

47:18.619 --> 47:21.257
- Are you seeing this?
- Dude, dude, dude, dude.

47:25.493 --> 47:27.660
Muzo. Dude.

47:27.662 --> 47:30.029
- I know. I'm sorry.
- Really? Are you serious?

47:30.031 --> 47:31.964
Aren't we done with that shit?

47:31.966 --> 47:33.500
I'm sorry. I'm done.

47:33.502 --> 47:35.335
We were just trying
to lighten the mood.

47:35.337 --> 47:36.669
I know. I'm done. All right.

47:36.671 --> 47:38.404
I'm done.

47:38.406 --> 47:39.875
Thank you.

47:40.942 --> 47:43.442
I'm so scared.

47:43.444 --> 47:45.579
This house is getting to me too.

47:45.581 --> 47:48.115
Look at this. Creepy.

47:48.117 --> 47:50.284
Eddie!

47:50.286 --> 47:53.420
Keith, have you seen Eddie?
Look...

47:53.422 --> 47:55.424
What's Keith looking at?

48:01.163 --> 48:03.063
Will you grab the glow sticks
out of my pack?

48:03.065 --> 48:05.199
Yeah.

48:05.201 --> 48:07.568
Hey, Chase, go ahead
and break one of those.

48:07.570 --> 48:10.642
Austin, check this out.
Looks like an urn.

48:12.542 --> 48:14.209
No way. Are you serious?

48:14.211 --> 48:16.214
Yeah. Looks like
Mr. Brandt's.

48:18.582 --> 48:21.051
Come on. Can we just leave?

48:22.653 --> 48:24.553
Put down the urn.

48:24.555 --> 48:26.620
Keith, what'd you find, dude?

48:26.622 --> 48:28.223
Austin, come get this.

48:28.225 --> 48:30.325
Look, see that?
Right in the middle?

48:30.327 --> 48:32.294
That's Mrs. Brandt.

48:32.296 --> 48:34.030
I don't get it,
though.

48:34.032 --> 48:36.231
I don't recognize a lot
of the kids in the picture.

48:36.233 --> 48:38.400
I mean, I will never
forget the ones

48:38.402 --> 48:40.302
that I saw
in the police report, but...

48:40.304 --> 48:42.405
I mean, they're right...
They're right in the front here.

48:42.407 --> 48:44.673
But the older ones...

48:44.675 --> 48:46.378
I don't know who
the hell they are.

48:48.413 --> 48:51.748
I mean, maybe it was
like some sort of family reunion.

48:51.750 --> 48:54.217
Just took a picture
with all of the cousins.

48:54.219 --> 48:55.688
I have no idea.

48:57.722 --> 49:01.024
Well, anyway, Chase
and I found the root cellar.

49:01.026 --> 49:02.760
You did? Did you find
anything down there?

49:02.762 --> 49:05.328
No, I mean, we didn't
actually go down there yet.

49:05.330 --> 49:07.464
Yeah, we're going
to check it out later.

49:07.466 --> 49:09.732
Let's keep looking
for Eddie.

49:09.734 --> 49:11.403
Yeah, good idea.

49:13.539 --> 49:15.140
Austin, come on.

49:16.675 --> 49:19.343
Hey, look,
everything's still here.

49:19.345 --> 49:22.212
Yeah. A lot of
them are medical books.

49:22.214 --> 49:24.114
I don't feel good about this.

49:24.116 --> 49:26.183
Keith, did the murders
happen at Christmastime?

49:26.185 --> 49:27.685
Hey, is this Lady Brandt?

49:27.687 --> 49:29.357
Everything here
creeps me out. What?

49:30.824 --> 49:32.760
I don't know, man.
That's creepy.

49:38.697 --> 49:40.697
Careful. Just... Hey...
Just, guys, just be careful.

49:40.699 --> 49:42.266
I got it, I got it.

49:42.268 --> 49:43.567
Look.

49:43.569 --> 49:45.271
Muzo, move. Muzo.

49:45.273 --> 49:47.173
I'm trying to get the shot.

49:47.175 --> 49:49.408
Creepy. It's a closet.
Okay, just go, come on.

49:49.410 --> 49:51.109
Yo, Keith, chill out.

49:51.111 --> 49:53.479
Guys, come on.

49:53.481 --> 49:56.582
Come on, guys.
Let's go.

49:56.584 --> 49:57.816
You all right,
buddy?

49:57.818 --> 49:59.286
Yeah.

50:02.322 --> 50:04.523
Okay, I'm definitely not going
in there first. You guys go.

50:04.525 --> 50:06.492
Someone shine the light in here.

50:06.494 --> 50:08.693
I don't want to be last, either.
Jesus Christ, Lucas!

50:08.695 --> 50:10.496
- Really, Luke?
- What's going on?

50:10.498 --> 50:12.399
It's not funny. You know what?
Just stay in there.

50:12.401 --> 50:14.169
- Seriously, dude.
- Dick.

50:16.571 --> 50:19.041
Let's go.
Guys, come on.

50:32.154 --> 50:33.553
We're home.

50:33.555 --> 50:35.092
What are you looking at?

50:42.831 --> 50:44.367
You okay?

50:47.237 --> 50:49.236
I feel like
I'm gonna be sick.

50:49.238 --> 50:50.673
There's a bathroom...

54:18.956 --> 54:20.557
Oh, God!

54:20.559 --> 54:22.495
Are you okay?

54:23.595 --> 54:24.927
Where were you?

54:24.929 --> 54:26.498
I was in the bathroom.

54:32.872 --> 54:34.538
Dude, come on.

54:34.540 --> 54:36.009
I just need to
check something out.

55:01.635 --> 55:03.403
Do you see anything?

55:12.780 --> 55:14.449
Austin, I'm going, man.

55:18.885 --> 55:21.053
Oh, shit! Shit!

55:22.823 --> 55:25.394
Okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay...

55:26.995 --> 55:28.895
Okay, okay, okay, okay...

55:28.897 --> 55:30.163
You good?

55:30.165 --> 55:32.433
Yeah, yeah. Why?

55:35.537 --> 55:37.039
Yo, what are you guys
looking at?

55:40.674 --> 55:42.644
That light's still on.

55:44.145 --> 55:45.582
Let's go.

56:00.161 --> 56:02.831
Keith, did you see her?

56:06.634 --> 56:09.236
Keith, Keith, what's the matter
with you?

56:09.238 --> 56:11.742
Chase? Man, I'm worried
about Keith.

56:14.010 --> 56:15.713
Keith? Come on, man.

56:18.247 --> 56:21.950
Chase? Dude, there's something
wrong with Keith.

56:21.952 --> 56:24.821
I found another picture
of Lady Brandt.

56:26.490 --> 56:28.526
That must
be Mr. Brandt.

56:29.593 --> 56:30.859
Kind of looks like you.

56:30.861 --> 56:32.060
Don't say that, okay?

56:32.062 --> 56:33.498
I'm serious.

56:36.833 --> 56:38.136
What is that noise?

56:42.239 --> 56:44.974
Guys, who
turned that light off?

56:44.976 --> 56:46.675
I didn't do it.

56:46.677 --> 56:48.610
This light was on
when we came up the stairs.

56:48.612 --> 56:51.049
Lucas tried the switches.
The power isn't even on.

56:52.984 --> 56:54.849
Where are you going, Keith?

56:54.851 --> 56:56.251
- Yo, isn't that the nursery?
- Yeah.

56:56.253 --> 56:58.187
I thought he said he was afraid
to go up there.

56:58.189 --> 56:59.591
Keith...

57:01.260 --> 57:02.993
Keith, you don't got
to prove anything to us

57:02.995 --> 57:04.464
by going up there.

57:13.037 --> 57:14.573
Creepy.

57:18.142 --> 57:20.877
Yo, this one's
of the pool.

57:20.879 --> 57:22.882
There's a dead body in it.

57:25.585 --> 57:27.721
Swimming without
adult supervision.

57:32.625 --> 57:34.094
What?

57:51.244 --> 57:53.680
It's freaking cold in here.

57:54.914 --> 57:56.747
Hey, Keith...

57:56.749 --> 57:59.554
is this where they found Lady
Brandt and all the kids killed?

58:14.602 --> 58:17.069
I feel like we should leave
flowers or something.

58:17.071 --> 58:18.540
Yeah.

58:19.975 --> 58:21.844
Keith, Keith, come on.

58:34.657 --> 58:36.226
We need to get
Keith out of here.

58:39.894 --> 58:41.829
Keith?

58:41.831 --> 58:44.133
Come on, buddy,
let's go.

58:46.302 --> 58:48.968
I wanna play.

58:48.970 --> 58:51.041
What are we
gonna play?

58:52.842 --> 58:55.742
- Is he coming?
- Just give him a minute.

58:55.744 --> 58:57.712
He's still by that damn chair.

58:57.714 --> 58:58.980
He's losing it, man.

59:00.383 --> 59:02.283
I wanna play.

59:02.285 --> 59:04.254
Can my friends come?

59:05.788 --> 59:06.924
Now?

59:09.325 --> 59:10.660
Okay...

59:15.064 --> 59:16.931
Keith, come on, man.

59:16.933 --> 59:18.269
Keith, snap out of it!

59:21.706 --> 59:23.204
It's Lady Brandt!
It's Lady Brandt!

59:23.206 --> 59:24.807
Keith! Keith!

59:24.809 --> 59:26.374
Muzo, come on, man!

59:26.376 --> 59:29.177
Keith! Keith!
Open the door, now!

59:29.179 --> 59:30.713
Guys, downstairs!

59:30.715 --> 59:32.815
Go, go!
Keith!

59:32.817 --> 59:34.382
Keith!

59:34.384 --> 59:36.418
Keith, come on!

59:36.420 --> 59:38.954
Help me! Get off of me! Please!

59:42.793 --> 59:45.227
Oh, man, he's upstairs.
Why are we coming down here?

59:45.229 --> 59:47.064
Guys, shh!

59:47.066 --> 59:48.397
Muzo, watch out!

59:50.301 --> 59:52.002
Somebody was just in that wall.

59:52.004 --> 59:53.370
You saw that, right? Right?

59:53.372 --> 59:55.171
- Austin, you saw that, right?
- Yes!

59:55.173 --> 59:57.339
- I mean, that was a person!
- What the hell was that?

59:57.341 --> 59:58.774
- A person?
- That was not a person.

59:58.776 --> 01:00:00.109
I mean, maybe it was Keith.

01:00:00.111 --> 01:00:02.078
People don't come
out of the walls.

01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:03.479
Walls don't move like that!

01:00:03.481 --> 01:00:05.247
Just shut up and let me
figure this out.

01:00:05.249 --> 01:00:06.783
Hold on, shut up, shut up.

01:00:06.785 --> 01:00:08.118
There's nothing to figure out!

01:00:08.120 --> 01:00:09.753
How can you
figure that out?

01:00:09.755 --> 01:00:11.288
Austin, turn it off
right now.

01:00:11.290 --> 01:00:13.090
Guys, this is not
helping anything.

01:00:13.092 --> 01:00:16.760
Guys! Guys, shut up.
It's not helping anything.

01:00:16.762 --> 01:00:18.896
Turn it off.
Turn it off right now.

01:00:18.898 --> 01:00:20.465
- Turn it off.
- All right. All right.

01:00:20.467 --> 01:00:22.934
I saw Keith. I saw Keith.

01:00:22.936 --> 01:00:24.469
I think he's dead, man.

01:00:24.471 --> 01:00:26.137
I saw... I saw him
get lifted up.

01:00:26.139 --> 01:00:27.838
- I saw him...
- Just because you saw him

01:00:27.840 --> 01:00:29.440
get lifted up doesn't mean
he's dead.

01:00:29.442 --> 01:00:31.275
We heard him downstairs
after the door slammed.

01:00:31.277 --> 01:00:33.278
I saw that Lady Brandt lady.
Man, I saw her.

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:35.080
You think you saw
Lady Brandt.

01:00:35.082 --> 01:00:37.115
I'm not thinking anything, man!
I'm not making this up.

01:00:37.117 --> 01:00:38.917
- Just because a door slams...
- No, man!

01:00:38.919 --> 01:00:41.854
Yo, stop! Stop! Stop! Stop!
This is not helping anybody.

01:00:41.856 --> 01:00:43.122
You don't listen to me ever!

01:00:43.124 --> 01:00:44.756
- I am listening to you!
- Shut up, dude.

01:00:44.758 --> 01:00:46.390
It's not helping anybody.

01:00:46.392 --> 01:00:48.526
Just because a door slams
doesn't mean our friend is dead.

01:00:48.528 --> 01:00:50.528
I know, but we don't
know what's going on.

01:00:50.530 --> 01:00:53.298
Guys, guys, guys.

01:00:55.068 --> 01:00:57.170
Oh...

01:00:57.172 --> 01:00:59.272
That's Eddie! That's Eddie!
I can't, man.

01:00:59.274 --> 01:01:01.040
That's Eddie, man.

01:01:01.042 --> 01:01:03.143
Look at that photo and tell me
you don't see Eddie!

01:01:03.145 --> 01:01:05.011
Tell me that's not Eddie!

01:01:05.013 --> 01:01:07.447
Why did we come here
in the first place?

01:01:07.449 --> 01:01:08.882
That is Eddie.

01:01:10.252 --> 01:01:12.051
That's impossible.

01:01:12.053 --> 01:01:13.485
Stop, dude.

01:01:13.487 --> 01:01:15.355
Stop. You're scaring the hell
out of me, man.

01:01:18.092 --> 01:01:20.125
Please. I promise
I'm not making this up.

01:01:20.127 --> 01:01:21.461
I promise I'm not
making this up.

01:01:21.463 --> 01:01:23.963
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

01:01:33.175 --> 01:01:35.209
Lucas, we can go.

01:01:35.211 --> 01:01:37.343
We're going, we're going.
Austin, come on. We're going.

01:01:37.345 --> 01:01:38.546
Let's go.

01:01:38.548 --> 01:01:40.213
Make them stay.

01:01:40.215 --> 01:01:41.448
No! No, you can't leave.

01:01:41.450 --> 01:01:43.517
Hey! Don't you
touch him!

01:01:43.519 --> 01:01:45.487
Stay down. What the hell
is the matter with you?

01:01:45.489 --> 01:01:48.022
We are done! No!
Hayley was right!

01:01:48.024 --> 01:01:50.025
We are out of here
right now!

01:01:51.828 --> 01:01:53.428
Put the camera down.

01:01:53.430 --> 01:01:55.297
Put the camera down.

01:01:55.299 --> 01:01:56.964
Put it down!

01:01:56.966 --> 01:01:58.466
Now!

01:01:58.468 --> 01:02:00.835
Muzo! Muzo!

01:02:00.837 --> 01:02:02.105
Muzo!

01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:04.906
Muzo, what's wrong, man?

01:02:04.908 --> 01:02:06.408
What's wrong? What's wrong?
What's wrong?

01:02:06.410 --> 01:02:07.909
I can hear them
screaming!

01:02:07.911 --> 01:02:10.146
- Calm down!
- What are you talking about?

01:02:10.148 --> 01:02:12.247
We're getting out.

01:02:13.351 --> 01:02:15.017
What the hell was that?

01:02:15.019 --> 01:02:16.852
Open the door!
Come on, Muzo, get up.

01:02:16.854 --> 01:02:18.220
- It's not opening.
- Pull harder.

01:02:18.222 --> 01:02:19.454
The lock's busted.

01:02:19.456 --> 01:02:21.189
I told you.

01:02:21.191 --> 01:02:22.624
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

01:02:22.626 --> 01:02:24.427
No, I got to get
out of here.

01:02:24.429 --> 01:02:27.028
- I got to open this door.
- Try the window.

01:02:28.432 --> 01:02:30.332
Stop. Stop.
Just calm down.

01:02:30.334 --> 01:02:32.068
We got to find a way
out of here.

01:02:32.070 --> 01:02:33.636
Screw this!

01:02:33.638 --> 01:02:35.439
Come on. Calm down, man.

01:02:35.441 --> 01:02:37.207
Calm down.
What's wrong with you?

01:02:37.209 --> 01:02:39.009
- What's wrong?
- Screw this.

01:02:39.011 --> 01:02:40.544
I just want to get out of here.

01:02:40.546 --> 01:02:43.145
Holy shit.

01:02:43.147 --> 01:02:45.214
- Damn it!
- We need to find another way out.

01:02:45.216 --> 01:02:47.484
- What if they're all like this?
- You want to stay and do nothing?

01:02:47.486 --> 01:02:49.085
- No! No!
- She's inside my head!

01:02:49.087 --> 01:02:50.920
- I'm going to die!
- Muzo, just calm down.

01:02:50.922 --> 01:02:52.623
Is she saying
we're all going to die?

01:02:52.625 --> 01:02:54.091
She's saying nobody leaves.

01:02:54.093 --> 01:02:55.292
She's not going
to let us leave.

01:02:55.294 --> 01:02:58.528
Shut the hell up.

01:02:58.530 --> 01:03:01.432
Dude, what is your problem?
What is your problem?

01:03:01.434 --> 01:03:02.599
Just stop, okay?

01:03:02.601 --> 01:03:04.568
Just stop.
Lucas, come on.

01:03:04.570 --> 01:03:07.005
We're gonna be right back, okay?
We'll be right back, okay?

01:03:07.007 --> 01:03:08.940
I'll be right back for you.
Can you just watch him?

01:03:08.942 --> 01:03:11.041
That's all you got to do,
is just watch him.

01:03:11.043 --> 01:03:12.409
Are you here?
Are you listening to me?

01:03:12.411 --> 01:03:14.012
- Yeah. Yes.
- Lucas, come on!

01:03:14.014 --> 01:03:15.249
I'm coming.

01:03:17.650 --> 01:03:21.319
Muzo, Muzo,
what is she saying to you?

01:03:21.321 --> 01:03:23.221
What is she
saying to you?

01:03:23.223 --> 01:03:24.589
She's saying
we don't leave.

01:03:24.591 --> 01:03:26.357
We're not going
to leave.

01:03:26.359 --> 01:03:28.459
Okay, have you seen her?

01:03:28.461 --> 01:03:30.062
Have you seen her?
Have you seen her?

01:03:30.064 --> 01:03:31.529
I need to know.
I need to know, man.

01:03:31.531 --> 01:03:33.299
- Have you seen her?
- No, I haven't seen her.

01:03:33.301 --> 01:03:34.600
- I haven't seen her.
- Come on.

01:03:34.602 --> 01:03:37.201
- Have you seen Billy?
- No! No! No, dude.

01:03:37.203 --> 01:03:40.004
Just people just screaming
inside of my head.

01:03:40.006 --> 01:03:41.607
- I don't see anyone.
- You haven't seen anybody?

01:03:41.609 --> 01:03:43.542
I haven't seen
anyone, okay?

01:03:43.544 --> 01:03:45.478
I just hear them screaming,
and I know we're never

01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:47.215
gonna get out
of this house.

01:03:48.650 --> 01:03:50.219
Austin.

01:03:52.253 --> 01:03:53.552
Muzo.

01:03:53.554 --> 01:03:55.088
I need you to stay
right here.

01:03:55.090 --> 01:03:57.123
I will be right back.
Just do not move.

01:03:57.125 --> 01:03:58.724
You stay right here.

01:03:58.726 --> 01:04:00.994
I'll be right back, okay?

01:04:00.996 --> 01:04:03.432
Okay? Don't move.
I'll be right back, okay?

01:05:32.725 --> 01:05:34.361
Shit.

01:06:06.760 --> 01:06:09.562
All right, we checked
all the windows, and...

01:06:09.564 --> 01:06:11.763
- Austin, where's Muzo?
- I don't know.

01:06:11.765 --> 01:06:13.799
- I left him right there.
- Where the hell's Muzo?

01:06:13.801 --> 01:06:15.234
- He's not here.
- I'm sorry.

01:06:15.236 --> 01:06:16.634
I left him right here...

01:06:16.636 --> 01:06:18.504
You promised.
I told you to watch him, man.

01:06:18.506 --> 01:06:19.871
Dude, what the hell
were you doing upstairs?

01:06:19.873 --> 01:06:21.272
Don't get mad at me
right now.

01:06:21.274 --> 01:06:22.674
You had one job.
To watch him Muzo.

01:06:22.676 --> 01:06:24.176
He was right there.

01:06:24.178 --> 01:06:25.643
Yo, okay, why is it
my responsibility?

01:06:25.645 --> 01:06:27.379
Because I told you to watch him!

01:06:27.381 --> 01:06:28.614
Don't yell at me, man.

01:06:28.616 --> 01:06:29.647
Get your head out of your ass.

01:06:29.649 --> 01:06:31.382
Don't tell me to do that.

01:06:31.384 --> 01:06:32.619
You don't know what's going on
with me, okay?

01:06:32.621 --> 01:06:34.186
Then tell us what's going on!

01:06:34.188 --> 01:06:35.621
I'm seeing things
all over the place!

01:06:35.623 --> 01:06:37.490
I'm seeing kids
running around.

01:06:37.492 --> 01:06:38.691
I'm seeing Mrs. Brandt.

01:06:38.693 --> 01:06:40.659
I'm seeing myself places.

01:06:40.661 --> 01:06:42.662
I'm seeing Billy
in the pool.

01:06:42.664 --> 01:06:44.530
I just saw Keith
upstairs.

01:06:44.532 --> 01:06:46.766
I am losing
my goddamn mind.

01:06:46.768 --> 01:06:49.436
So, I'm sorry
if I lost Muzo.

01:06:49.438 --> 01:06:51.304
Don't be sorry. This place
is getting to all of us.

01:06:51.306 --> 01:06:52.905
Okay? I don't know what you saw.

01:06:52.907 --> 01:06:54.807
I don't know why we can't
get out of this house,

01:06:54.809 --> 01:06:57.645
but if we're gonna do it,
we're gonna do it together.

01:06:57.647 --> 01:06:58.879
I'm scared shitless, guys.

01:06:58.881 --> 01:07:00.848
We all are, man.

01:07:00.850 --> 01:07:03.683
Okay, let's just stick together
and let's look for Muzo, okay?

01:07:03.685 --> 01:07:05.486
Okay?

01:07:05.488 --> 01:07:07.221
Okay.

01:07:07.223 --> 01:07:08.422
Just stay together.

01:07:08.424 --> 01:07:10.158
Come on.
Let's stay together.

01:07:10.160 --> 01:07:11.662
You all right?

01:07:15.665 --> 01:07:17.468
Muzo!

01:07:25.608 --> 01:07:26.677
He's probably dead.

01:07:28.846 --> 01:07:31.213
- Come on, we'll find him.
- He would have heard us by now.

01:07:31.215 --> 01:07:32.584
Come on. Muzo.

01:08:21.867 --> 01:08:24.337
What the hell?

01:08:26.939 --> 01:08:30.310
Oh, my God. This can't be real.
This can't be happening.

01:08:33.379 --> 01:08:35.279
You got something?

01:08:35.282 --> 01:08:37.782
The camera's showing
something else.

01:08:37.783 --> 01:08:39.250
What's it showing?

01:08:39.252 --> 01:08:40.484
The murders.

01:08:40.486 --> 01:08:42.353
Lady Brandt killing
her children.

01:08:42.354 --> 01:08:43.721
That's impossible.

01:08:43.724 --> 01:08:45.991
Here, look.

01:08:45.993 --> 01:08:47.392
There's nothing there.

01:08:47.394 --> 01:08:48.893
- What?
- There's nothing there.

01:08:48.895 --> 01:08:50.428
No, it's right there.
It's right there. Look.

01:08:50.430 --> 01:08:51.763
Dude, I'm looking right at it.

01:08:51.765 --> 01:08:52.934
There's nothing there.

01:08:55.033 --> 01:08:57.536
Austin, is this some kind
of joke, man?

01:08:57.537 --> 01:08:58.770
Austin.

01:08:58.772 --> 01:09:00.973
Austin, look at me.

01:09:00.975 --> 01:09:03.742
Look at me.
There is nothing there.

01:09:03.743 --> 01:09:05.978
We don't have time
for this shit.

01:09:05.979 --> 01:09:08.616
Chase, they're right behind you.

01:09:17.892 --> 01:09:20.060
You killed them.

01:09:20.062 --> 01:09:22.395
You killed all your children.

01:09:22.397 --> 01:09:26.365
I want to be with my family
forever, my sweet.

01:09:26.367 --> 01:09:28.702
Keep them.
Just please let us leave.

01:09:28.703 --> 01:09:30.636
They are my family.

01:09:30.638 --> 01:09:33.340
Nobody takes my family.

01:10:26.997 --> 01:10:28.664
Muzo?

01:10:28.666 --> 01:10:29.997
What?

01:10:29.999 --> 01:10:32.434
Muzo.

01:10:32.436 --> 01:10:34.403
Muzo, where the hell
have you been, man?

01:10:34.405 --> 01:10:35.607
Come on, we're getting
out of here.

01:10:38.677 --> 01:10:40.046
Muzo, you okay?

01:10:41.413 --> 01:10:42.711
Hey, hey, hey.

01:10:42.713 --> 01:10:44.716
Something's wrong.

01:10:47.651 --> 01:10:49.551
Muzo. Come on, man.

01:10:49.553 --> 01:10:50.955
It's not him, Chase.
He has a knife.

01:10:52.723 --> 01:10:54.623
Muzo. Muzo.

01:10:54.625 --> 01:10:56.092
- Lucas, he has a knife.
- Muzo, you asshole.

01:10:56.094 --> 01:10:57.528
I was looking for you.

01:10:57.530 --> 01:10:59.396
- No, no, no, no.
- No, come on, come on...

01:11:05.538 --> 01:11:07.104
Muzo, just put the knife down.

01:11:07.106 --> 01:11:08.773
- Put the knife down.
- Muzo, stop.

01:11:08.775 --> 01:11:10.841
- Please don't. No!
- Put the knife down!

01:11:18.884 --> 01:11:21.820
Put pressure on it.
Put pressure on it.

01:11:21.822 --> 01:11:23.754
Put pressure on it.

01:11:23.756 --> 01:11:26.792
Muzo. Muzo, stop.

01:11:26.794 --> 01:11:28.863
Chase, don't let him
get the knife.

01:11:31.631 --> 01:11:34.466
Muzo. Muzo, stop.
Muzo!

01:11:34.468 --> 01:11:36.200
Come on, it's us.

01:11:36.202 --> 01:11:38.904
Muzo, it's me, Chase.
Look at me.

01:11:38.906 --> 01:11:40.838
Muzo, we've been friends
since we were eight years old.

01:11:40.840 --> 01:11:42.440
Come on, you're the toughest guy
I know.

01:11:42.442 --> 01:11:43.742
Fight this.

01:11:43.744 --> 01:11:45.178
- Chase, stop, stop.
- Look at him.

01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:46.879
Look at your best friend.
That's Lucas.

01:11:46.881 --> 01:11:48.647
If we don't make it
out of here soon,

01:11:48.649 --> 01:11:50.085
he's not going to make it,
Muzo.

01:11:51.685 --> 01:11:53.855
Look what you did!
Muzo, fight this!

01:11:57.625 --> 01:11:58.860
Please.

01:12:01.996 --> 01:12:03.196
No!

01:12:03.198 --> 01:12:06.798
I miss all of us.

01:12:06.800 --> 01:12:07.936
No!

01:12:12.675 --> 01:12:13.907
Muzo.

01:12:18.681 --> 01:12:20.950
He's dead.

01:12:24.220 --> 01:12:26.021
We gonna get out of here.

01:12:27.489 --> 01:12:29.923
Come on, Lucas.
Come on.

01:12:29.925 --> 01:12:31.491
We're going to get you
out of here.

01:12:31.493 --> 01:12:33.126
We're going to get some help.
Come on.

01:12:33.128 --> 01:12:34.895
Come on,
you have to help me.

01:12:34.897 --> 01:12:36.797
Easy.

01:12:36.799 --> 01:12:38.166
Come on.

01:12:38.168 --> 01:12:39.766
Give me your hand.

01:12:39.768 --> 01:12:41.504
Come on. Come on.

01:12:42.739 --> 01:12:44.506
Come on, Austin.

01:12:44.508 --> 01:12:45.840
Here.

01:13:37.563 --> 01:13:39.065
It is done.

01:13:42.166 --> 01:13:44.134
The inevitable is happening,
my sweet.

01:13:44.136 --> 01:13:46.105
He is with me.

01:13:47.840 --> 01:13:49.676
I want my family.

01:13:50.944 --> 01:13:52.677
You tried to leave.

01:13:52.679 --> 01:13:54.210
You tried to take
my children.

01:13:54.212 --> 01:13:56.816
You tried to destroy
my family!

01:13:59.319 --> 01:14:00.787
You've upset Mother.

01:14:02.588 --> 01:14:04.254
Come now.

01:14:04.256 --> 01:14:06.022
Return to the family,
my sweet.

01:14:06.024 --> 01:14:07.357
Stop calling me that.

01:14:07.359 --> 01:14:08.827
Don't raise your voice
to Mother.

01:14:08.829 --> 01:14:10.062
Do you want to make Mother
angry?

01:14:18.305 --> 01:14:20.238
There, there.

01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:22.076
There, there, my sweet.

01:14:24.311 --> 01:14:26.080
That didn't hurt.

01:14:30.750 --> 01:14:32.955
Why now? Why me?

01:14:34.856 --> 01:14:37.090
Why?

01:14:37.092 --> 01:14:39.594
All this
is because of you.

01:14:40.928 --> 01:14:44.997
We are all here
because you came back.

01:14:44.999 --> 01:14:46.399
I told the children
that you'd be back,

01:14:46.401 --> 01:14:48.301
that Father
would be back.

01:14:48.303 --> 01:14:51.404
You tired to leave us, Father,
but now you've returned.

01:14:51.406 --> 01:14:53.576
With more children.

01:14:54.909 --> 01:14:56.345
With our children.

01:14:58.981 --> 01:15:00.983
We can be
a big family now.

01:15:06.255 --> 01:15:08.191
Don't run away
anymore, Father.

01:15:09.791 --> 01:15:11.694
You know this is where
you belong.

01:15:15.164 --> 01:15:16.966
That's why I saw it?

01:15:19.134 --> 01:15:20.670
Stay with us.

01:15:21.837 --> 01:15:23.737
Stay with me.

01:15:23.739 --> 01:15:26.708
It won't take long.
Just let go.

01:15:26.710 --> 01:15:28.677
It will only hurt
a little while, my sweet.

01:16:14.860 --> 01:16:17.027
Hold it, hold it.

01:16:17.029 --> 01:16:18.360
Come on.

01:16:19.932 --> 01:16:21.934
All right, I got you.
I got you. Come on.

01:16:33.213 --> 01:16:36.183
Aah!

01:16:40.754 --> 01:16:42.990
Come on.
Austin, come on.

01:16:46.291 --> 01:16:48.696
Don't let them leave.

01:16:53.031 --> 01:16:54.834
Oh, shit.

01:16:56.170 --> 01:16:57.439
Oh, shit.

01:17:07.247 --> 01:17:08.981
Go by the door.

01:17:08.983 --> 01:17:10.949
Austin, come on, man.
Come on.

01:17:10.951 --> 01:17:12.854
What's wrong with you?
Hurry up.

01:17:14.087 --> 01:17:16.457
Austin, snap out of it.
Come on.

01:17:21.797 --> 01:17:23.263
It just picked me up, man.

01:17:23.265 --> 01:17:25.063
Come on, get up,
get up, get up.

01:17:25.065 --> 01:17:26.299
Get up, come on.

01:17:26.301 --> 01:17:27.870
Come on, stay up.

01:17:29.203 --> 01:17:31.072
Oh, my God. The urn.

01:17:33.207 --> 01:17:35.340
Get out the window, man! Stop!

01:17:35.342 --> 01:17:36.979
Just go.

01:17:40.548 --> 01:17:42.016
Lucas, come on.

01:17:44.553 --> 01:17:46.554
- Austin, help me, please.
- Just let go.

01:17:46.556 --> 01:17:48.792
What the...? Chase!

01:17:51.427 --> 01:17:53.460
Austin, help me!

01:17:53.462 --> 01:17:56.165
- Let him go!
- What? Help me!

01:18:01.137 --> 01:18:03.173
Come on.
Let's go, Austin.

01:18:04.606 --> 01:18:06.142
Austin, come on!

01:18:09.079 --> 01:18:11.613
I got the camera.

01:18:15.151 --> 01:18:16.453
Austin!

01:18:17.888 --> 01:18:20.221
Austin, come on!

01:18:24.961 --> 01:18:27.628
Austin, walk faster, buddy.

01:18:27.630 --> 01:18:30.066
Austin, stop pulling me.
Come on.

01:18:32.202 --> 01:18:33.805
Austin.

01:18:37.908 --> 01:18:40.976
Austin, buddy, what's wrong?

01:18:40.978 --> 01:18:43.014
Dude, we got to go!
Come on!

01:18:44.581 --> 01:18:46.214
No.

01:18:46.216 --> 01:18:48.219
No, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

01:18:49.519 --> 01:18:51.889
Shit. Shit.

01:18:57.128 --> 01:19:00.196
I can't leave him.
I can't leave him.

01:19:00.198 --> 01:19:01.565
Austin.

01:19:01.567 --> 01:19:02.965
Come on.

01:19:02.967 --> 01:19:04.968
Austin, come on...

01:19:04.970 --> 01:19:06.306
Shit.

01:19:07.439 --> 01:19:08.575
Oh, shit.

01:19:10.309 --> 01:19:11.978
Austin, come on.

01:19:17.983 --> 01:19:19.951
Please help me.

01:19:19.953 --> 01:19:21.251
Oh, shit.

01:19:24.257 --> 01:19:25.590
Wait.

01:19:27.394 --> 01:19:29.460
Wait. Wait.

01:19:29.462 --> 01:19:31.165
Wait.

01:19:33.934 --> 01:19:35.633
All right,
I don't have much time.

01:19:35.635 --> 01:19:38.670
This was supposed
to be a joke.

01:19:38.672 --> 01:19:41.371
This was not
supposed to be serious.

01:19:41.373 --> 01:19:43.542
And... and there's something
really wrong in this house.

01:19:43.544 --> 01:19:45.380
Don't fight it.

01:20:10.071 --> 01:20:12.574
Oh, my God. The pool.

01:20:17.211 --> 01:20:18.915
Shit.

01:20:21.983 --> 01:20:24.583
Guys, guys, I'm sorry.
I'm sorry.

01:20:24.585 --> 01:20:26.254
Please...

01:20:27.488 --> 01:20:29.288
I'm sorry...

01:21:05.596 --> 01:21:07.496
So, what's up,
everybody?

01:21:07.498 --> 01:21:09.734
This is Chase here,
and this is the Hell Gang.

01:22:06.325 --> 01:22:07.758
It feels weird
to feel a muscle

01:22:07.760 --> 01:22:09.194
that I haven't used
in forever...

01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:15.165
You have to yell "Squanto"
and throw the ball.

01:23:12.226 --> 01:23:13.460
Whoa, that's not okay!

01:23:51.835 --> 01:23:53.435
Aah!

01:24:05.786 --> 01:24:10.786
