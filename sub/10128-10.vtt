00:31.500 --> 00:32.900
YOU TALKING
TO ME?

00:32.900 --> 00:35.100
ACTUALLY, I WAS JUST
TALKING TO MYSELF,

00:35.100 --> 00:37.467
BUT YOU LOOK LIKE
YOU'RE IN THE SAME BOAT.

00:37.467 --> 00:38.500
WHAT BOAT? WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

00:38.500 --> 00:40.467
I'M JUST SITTING HERE
AT MY TABLE ALONE,

00:40.467 --> 00:42.367
TRYING TO ENJOY
A CUP OF COFFEE.

00:42.367 --> 00:43.867
LOOK AT THEM.

00:45.100 --> 00:50.100
LAUGHING, ENJOYING THEMSELVES,
HAVING A GOOD TIME...

00:50.100 --> 00:51.100
I HATE THEM!

00:52.200 --> 00:53.200

00:53.200 --> 00:54.900
THEM--

00:54.900 --> 00:57.133
THE POPULAR.

00:57.133 --> 00:58.667
I'M POPULAR.

00:59.900 --> 01:02.233
HEY, MAN, WHY DON'T YOU
COME AND SIT WITH ME?

01:02.233 --> 01:03.467
NO.

01:03.467 --> 01:06.300
WHY DON'T YOU COME
SIT WITH ME?

01:06.300 --> 01:07.667
NAH.

01:07.667 --> 01:09.300
THEN THERE IT IS, THEN.

01:09.300 --> 01:10.400
YEAH,
THERE IT IS.

01:10.400 --> 01:12.500
P.A.: ATTENTION.
THE PENNBROOK HARVEST MIXER

01:12.500 --> 01:14.400
IS ABOUT TO START
ON THE SECOND FLOOR.

01:14.400 --> 01:20.600
AND REMEMBER, ONLY THOSE
WITH INVITATIONS MAY ATTEND.

01:20.600 --> 01:24.100
WELL, LOOKS LIKE
IT'S JUST YOU
AND ME, HUH?

01:25.867 --> 01:27.867
NOW IT'S JUST YOU.

01:36.467 --> 01:38.300
GOOD MORNING.

01:38.300 --> 01:39.867

ONE OF THOSE

01:39.867 --> 01:42.467
DELICIOUS CUPS OF COFFEE
FROM BREW LAGOON,

01:42.467 --> 01:43.467
CONVENIENTLY LOCATED

01:43.467 --> 01:44.967
IN THE PENNBROOK
STUDENT UNION?

01:44.967 --> 01:47.200
HEH...WHY ARE YOU
TALKING LIKE THAT?

01:47.200 --> 01:48.300
I'M NOT.

01:52.500 --> 01:55.000
RACHEL, WHY DON'T YOU
SCRAPE THE GARBAGE

01:55.000 --> 01:56.000
INTO THE GARBAGE DISPOSAL?

01:56.000 --> 01:59.000
I'D JUST RATHER
DO IT THIS WAY, OK?

02:00.100 --> 02:01.934
OK.

02:01.934 --> 02:02.934
HAVE A GOOD MORNING,

02:02.934 --> 02:04.100

02:11.033 --> 02:12.967
HEY, WHAT'S ALL
THE EXCITEMENT?

02:12.967 --> 02:14.767
11 A.M., MAN.
SHE'S BACK FROM THE GYM,

02:14.767 --> 02:16.300
LITTLE SWEATY, VERY SEXY.

02:16.300 --> 02:17.967
DRIVES ME CRAZY, DUDE!

02:17.967 --> 02:19.200
AND THEN, THE SHOWER.

02:19.200 --> 02:21.800
WAIT A MINUTE.
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

02:21.800 --> 02:23.600
HER, MAN!

02:23.600 --> 02:25.367
THE ONE
IN THE BACKGROUND,

02:25.367 --> 02:29.200
BEHIND THE UNPOPULAR GUY
DOING THE PUPPET SHOW.

02:29.200 --> 02:30.200
HEY!

02:30.200 --> 02:31.700
GET OUT OF THE WAY,
CUCKOO'S NEST!

02:31.700 --> 02:33.800
YOU'RE BLOCKING
THE GODDESS!

02:42.233 --> 02:44.100
YOU SURE
THAT'S 3 CHEESES?

02:44.100 --> 02:45.500
'CAUSE I ONLY SEE 2.

02:45.500 --> 02:47.500
WHERE'S THE GOUDA, PAL?

02:48.667 --> 02:49.767
THAT'S RIGHT.
THAT'S BETTER.

02:49.767 --> 02:51.600
THERE'S A LOT RIDING
ON THESE HERE EGGS.

02:51.600 --> 02:54.567
HEY, I MADE FEENY
A HAPPY FACE WAFFLE.

02:54.567 --> 02:57.100
HUH? THE BLUEBERRIES
ARE THE EYES.

02:57.100 --> 02:59.000
OH, THIS IS
SO GONNA WORK.

02:59.000 --> 03:01.734
BUT I AM CONCERNED
THIS IS A TAD
MORALLY WRONG.

03:01.734 --> 03:03.400
OH, PLEASE.
CORY, ALL WE'RE DOING

03:03.400 --> 03:06.600
IS TREATING THE MAN WHO
HAS BEEN THE DRIVING FORCE
IN OUR LIVES TO A BRUNCH.

03:06.600 --> 03:10.400
AND IF HE HAPPENS
TO GO A LITTLE EASIER
ON US IN CLASS,

03:10.400 --> 03:11.800
SO BE IT.

03:12.867 --> 03:14.500
HERE YOU GO,
MR. FEENY.

03:14.500 --> 03:16.467
OOH, A HAPPY FACE
WAFFLE.

03:16.467 --> 03:17.934
AND A 3-CHEESE OMELET

03:17.934 --> 03:20.300
FIT FOR THE BEST EDUCATOR
IN AMERICA.

03:20.300 --> 03:23.367
THAT'S 1, 2...
AND GOUDA MAKES 3.

03:23.367 --> 03:24.667
I LIKE GOUDA.

03:24.667 --> 03:26.000
I KNEW THAT.

03:26.000 --> 03:28.834
BUT BRUNCH REALLY
WASN'T NECESSARY.

03:28.834 --> 03:32.700
OH, IT'S NOTHING.
IT'S OUR WAY OF
SAYING THANKS.

03:32.700 --> 03:35.033
WE'RE JUST GLAD
WE COULD SNEAK AWAY

03:35.033 --> 03:36.734
FROM ALL OUR STUDIES
TO DO IT.

03:36.734 --> 03:39.133
BEEN BURNING
THE MIDNIGHT OIL,
HAVE YOU?

03:39.133 --> 03:41.500
HA HA. THEY ARE
KILLING US, FEENY.

03:41.500 --> 03:44.867
I MEAN, THAT PROFESSOR
WILLIAMS IS A SADIST.

03:44.867 --> 03:47.367
WELL, THERE'S
ALWAYS ONE
TOUGH CLASS.

03:47.367 --> 03:48.400
IF ONLY.

03:48.400 --> 03:49.567
THEY'RE ALL RIDICULOUS.

03:49.567 --> 03:50.600
SCONE?

03:50.600 --> 03:51.600
OH, NO. PLEASE,

03:51.600 --> 03:52.800
I REALLY HAVE
QUITE ENOUGH FOOD.

03:52.800 --> 03:55.367
ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
LOOK AT YOU.

03:55.367 --> 03:57.600
YOU'RE RIPPED.
YOU'RE CUT.

03:57.600 --> 03:59.400
JELLY?

03:59.400 --> 04:00.967
BOYS, FAR BE IT
FROM ME

04:00.967 --> 04:02.567
TO LOOK
A HAPPY-FACED WAFFLE

04:02.567 --> 04:05.100
IN ITS HAPPY-FACED
LITTLE MOUTH,

04:05.100 --> 04:06.600
BUT WHAT'S
THE DEAL?

04:06.600 --> 04:07.600
DEAL?

04:07.600 --> 04:08.600
OUCH.

04:08.600 --> 04:10.600
YOUR WORDS HURT
LIKE FISTS.

04:10.600 --> 04:12.967
WE REALLY TOOK YOU OUT
AS AN APPRECIATION

04:12.967 --> 04:14.500
OF HOW MUCH YOU'VE
TAUGHT US THUS FAR.

04:14.500 --> 04:16.834
AND WE KNOW THAT
YOU'VE GOT A VESTED
INTEREST IN US

04:16.834 --> 04:17.867
AND WANT TO SEE US
DO WELL.

04:17.867 --> 04:19.233
OH, I DO, I DO.

04:19.233 --> 04:21.300
WE WANT YOU TO KNOW
WE'LL TRY VERY HARD
IN YOUR CLASS.

04:21.300 --> 04:24.133
EVEN THOUGH WE'VE GOT
SO MUCH WORK IN ALL
OUR OTHER CLASSES.

04:24.133 --> 04:25.300
I MEAN, THEY'RE
KILLING US, FEENY.

04:25.300 --> 04:26.700
IT'S LIKE
WE CAN'T BREATHE.

04:26.700 --> 04:30.033
BUT WE DO NOT WANT
ANY SPECIAL TREATMENT
OR CONSIDERATION...

04:30.033 --> 04:33.467
AND WE DON'T WANT YOU
TO THINK OF THIS BRUNCH
AS A BRIBE.

04:33.467 --> 04:34.567
A BRIBE?

04:34.567 --> 04:36.400
YOU WANT AN EXTENSION
ON YOUR MIDTERM PAPERS?

04:36.400 --> 04:40.033
WE'LL GIVE YOU
100 BUCKS CASH RIGHT NOW.

04:41.200 --> 04:43.300
BOYS, WE'VE KNOWN
EACH OTHER FOR YEARS.

04:43.300 --> 04:45.200
WE HAVE A LONG HISTORY
TOGETHER.

04:45.200 --> 04:46.867
YOU DON'T HAVE TO
GO THROUGH ALL THIS.

04:46.867 --> 04:49.400
IF YOU NEED SOME HELP,
JUST ASK.

04:49.400 --> 04:51.867
WE JUST NEED A FEW DAYS.

04:51.867 --> 04:53.233
3.
4.

04:53.233 --> 04:54.767
2.

04:54.767 --> 04:56.734
ALL RIGHT. 2.

04:56.734 --> 04:59.567
NOW THAT'S HOW
YOU MAKE A DEAL.

05:00.600 --> 05:02.834
MORE BUBBLY?

05:05.400 --> 05:07.600
[SLURPING]

05:07.600 --> 05:09.900
AND THAT'S HOW
YOU EAT SOUP.

05:09.900 --> 05:10.900
IF IT'S HOT,

05:10.900 --> 05:12.934
I'VE FOUND
YOU CAN BLOW ON IT.

05:12.934 --> 05:14.233
LET'S TRY IT.

05:15.300 --> 05:16.734
WHY?!

05:17.900 --> 05:20.467
ARRRGHH!

05:22.100 --> 05:24.400
HOW LONG HAVE YOU
BEEN FILMING US?

05:24.400 --> 05:25.934
IT'S NOT FILM.
IT'S LIVE.

05:25.934 --> 05:27.700
IT'S SPONTANEOUS.
IT'S UNREHEARSED.

05:27.700 --> 05:30.500
ABSOLUTELY ANYTHING
CAN HAPPEN. EVEN THIS!

05:31.567 --> 05:34.834
TOLD YOU
THEY WERE GAY.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.100
WHY WOULD YOU
DO THIS?

05:36.100 --> 05:38.100
YOU WANNA KNOW?

05:38.100 --> 05:41.233
I WAS AFRAID, OK?

05:41.233 --> 05:43.133
I'M AFRAID
TO JUST BE ANOTHER FACE

05:43.133 --> 05:46.967
IN THE COLLEGE CROWD.
I JUST WANT PEOPLE
TO KNOW ME.

05:46.967 --> 05:49.100
MAYBE IF THEY DO,
THEN THEY'D COME OVER

05:49.100 --> 05:52.900
AND THEY'D SIT WITH ME
IN THE MORNING AND JUST
DRINK A CUP OF COFFEE.

05:52.900 --> 05:54.500
YOU DID THIS
TO HAVE FRIENDS?

05:54.500 --> 05:57.133
YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.
I DID THIS TO BE POPULAR.

05:59.100 --> 06:01.367

JUST TO GET TO THIS.

06:26.667 --> 06:28.700

BE WATCHING HER?
THAT'S CRAZY.

06:36.500 --> 06:38.000
SHE'S NOT EVEN DRESSED--

HEY, WE GOT
THE SAME GRADE.

07:21.133 --> 07:22.200
THIS IS A TRAVESTY.

07:22.200 --> 07:23.600
I GOT A B-PLUS.

07:23.600 --> 07:27.100
WHO CARES? HOW DO I
GET THE SAME GRADE

07:27.100 --> 07:29.800
FEENY, THANK YOU

IF I UNDERSTAND THIS.

08:03.033 --> 08:06.800
YOU JUST DECIDED
THAT I WOULD GIVE YOU
ANOTHER EXTENSION?

08:06.800 --> 08:09.700

OUR LONG HISTORY
TOGETHER.

08:09.700 --> 08:13.300
SO YOU JUST
DIDN'T BOTHER TO DO
THE PAPERS AT ALL?

08:13.300 --> 08:14.600
THEY'RE
KILLING US.

08:14.600 --> 08:16.934
IT'S LIKE WE
CAN'T BREATHE.

08:16.934 --> 08:18.734
I SEE. WELL,
THERE'S NO NEED

08:18.734 --> 08:22.700
FOR YOU TO TURN IN
YOUR PAPERS AT ALL, BOYS.

08:23.767 --> 08:25.567
SOUNDS GOOD.

08:25.567 --> 08:27.600

08:47.367 --> 08:50.567
YEAH, I KNOW.
HE DIDN'T EVEN
DISCUSS IT, DID HE?

08:50.567 --> 08:52.367
HE GAVE US
AN EXTENSION
ON THE MIDTERM.

08:52.367 --> 08:53.700
WHAT'S THE BIG DEAL
WITH THIS ONE?

08:53.700 --> 08:55.367

18:37.567 --> 18:38.667
ON THE STRENGTHS
OF OUR EFFORTS

18:38.667 --> 18:41.400
AND NOT ON
THE STRENGTHS OF
OUR FRIENDSHIP.

18:41.400 --> 18:43.200
WELL, I AM...

18:43.200 --> 18:44.834
DEEPLY...

18:46.200 --> 18:48.133
DEEPLY...

18:48.133 --> 18:49.467
TOUCHED.

18:50.500 --> 18:52.033
"F."

18:53.800 --> 18:55.367
"F."

19:05.033 --> 19:08.367
WHAT WOULD A D-MINUS
GET ME?

19:17.934 --> 19:19.300
I GOTTA TELL YOU,
THAT LITTLE STUNT
YOU PULLED,

19:19.300 --> 19:21.467
REALLY BACKFIRED.

19:21.467 --> 19:22.800
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

19:22.800 --> 19:24.967
I'M THE MOST
POPULAR DUDE ON CAMPUS.

19:24.967 --> 19:27.500
NOT WITH RACHEL.
WHILE YOU WERE BUSY
TERRORIZING HER,

19:27.500 --> 19:29.467
RACHEL AND I
GOT MUCH CLOSER,

19:29.467 --> 19:31.033
IF YOU CATCH
MY DRIFT.

19:31.033 --> 19:33.500
YOU INGRATE.

19:33.500 --> 19:36.300
I PUT YOU ON TV,
AND THAT'S HOW YOU REPAY ME?

19:36.300 --> 19:37.800
HUH? BY STEALING
MY GIRL?

19:37.800 --> 19:39.600
HOW DO YOU LIVE
WITH YOURSELF?

19:39.600 --> 19:41.867
I DON'T.
I LIVE WITH YOU.

19:41.867 --> 19:43.467
YEAH, I'M THINKING
RACHEL AND I

19:43.467 --> 19:46.100
MIGHT TAKE
OUR RELATIONSHIP
TO THAT NEXT LEVEL.

19:46.100 --> 19:48.667
THANK YOU, ERIC.

19:48.667 --> 19:50.100
OH, COULD YOU GUYS
DISAPPEAR?

19:50.100 --> 19:52.500
I'D LIKE TO BE LEFT ALONE
WITH MY DATE.

19:52.500 --> 19:53.667
DATE?

19:53.667 --> 19:54.967
YEAH. I FOUND A GUY

19:54.967 --> 19:57.500
WHO'S ABSOLUTELY
CRAZY ABOUT ME.

19:57.500 --> 20:00.467
HEY, LOSERS.
