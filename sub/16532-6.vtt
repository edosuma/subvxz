00:03.410 --> 00:05.380
Hey, baby brother!

00:05.550 --> 00:07.890
Let's not insult us both.
How much do you need?

00:07.920 --> 00:10.190
Mom paid my car insurance this month,
and I told her I'd have it today...

00:10.220 --> 00:12.030
The number, the number. $120.

00:13.190 --> 00:15.030
Grandpa got me a job
at his country club,

00:15.060 --> 00:17.030
and I've been cleaning up
in tips.

00:17.060 --> 00:19.400
I also like
the way those guys talk.

00:19.430 --> 00:22.570
There's actually an ethnic slur
for Norwegians.

00:22.600 --> 00:24.570
It's ice ers.

00:24.600 --> 00:26.380
Hey, buddy,
they canceled my showing,

00:26.410 --> 00:27.910
so I can drive you to work.

00:27.940 --> 00:29.250
That looks good.
What is it?

00:29.280 --> 00:31.250
Lobster Thermidor
from the country club.

00:31.280 --> 00:32.920
There's also cherries jubilee
in the fridge.

00:32.950 --> 00:34.420
Mmm.

00:34.450 --> 00:38.520
Look at us eating
like rich people in the '50s.

00:38.550 --> 00:40.120
Hey, Mom!
Have a good day at work.

00:40.150 --> 00:42.690
Uh, I already did that.
It's 3:30.

00:42.720 --> 00:44.730
How are you just waking up?

00:44.760 --> 00:46.960
I set my alarm for noon.
I must have slept through it.

00:46.990 --> 00:48.600
I was working late
promoting a new club.

00:48.630 --> 00:51.800
Oh, by the way,
here is the insurance money.

00:51.830 --> 00:53.700
Thank you.
A lot of singles
in there.

00:53.730 --> 00:55.370
What exactly do you do
at this club?

00:55.400 --> 00:56.470
Oh, right.

00:56.500 --> 00:58.410
'Cause I'm a stripper, Alex.

00:58.440 --> 01:01.480
Oh, my God, do you really think
I'm a stripper?

01:01.510 --> 01:02.610
No.
No.

01:02.640 --> 01:04.050
Okay, well, I'm off.

01:04.080 --> 01:05.220
I'm signing up
for some business classes

01:05.250 --> 01:06.380
at community college.

01:06.410 --> 01:07.920
Business class, huh?

01:07.950 --> 01:10.090
Sounds like somebody's
been influenced

01:10.120 --> 01:12.220
by living under the same roof

01:12.250 --> 01:13.990
with a certain
captain of industry.

01:14.020 --> 01:16.090
Thank you, honey,
but none of my success

01:16.120 --> 01:19.000
would have been possible without
your support as a homemaker.

01:19.030 --> 01:20.430
Sweetheart,
while I'm very flattered

01:20.460 --> 01:22.430
by your sudden interest
in business,

01:22.460 --> 01:24.670
how about instead of
another class, you get a job?

01:24.700 --> 01:26.400
Get your hands a
little dirty, huh?

01:26.430 --> 01:27.970
She could run her hands
through her hair.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.610
That would do it.
I've already
pre-registered.

01:29.640 --> 01:30.810
Also, I signed us up
for that book signing tonight.

01:30.840 --> 01:31.810
You still in?

01:31.840 --> 01:32.980
Absolutely.

01:33.010 --> 01:34.910
Got my book right here.

01:34.940 --> 01:36.820
Trying to make it look like
you read it?
Amateur.

01:49.020 --> 01:51.960
**

01:55.130 --> 01:56.470
So, I don't really have
a job title

01:56.500 --> 01:57.600
or even a set place to work,

01:57.630 --> 01:58.800
so I kind of just float around

01:58.830 --> 02:01.170
and make sure
everyone has what they need.

02:01.200 --> 02:02.610
4:00,
Your Honor.

02:02.640 --> 02:04.810
Don't forget
to take your medicine.

02:04.840 --> 02:06.640
Well, all these powerful guys.

02:06.670 --> 02:09.180
You can make connections here
that'll last forever.

02:09.210 --> 02:10.180
Not really.

02:10.210 --> 02:11.680
We have a lot of turnover here.

02:11.710 --> 02:13.550
That flag outside has been
at half-mast since April.

02:13.580 --> 02:15.020
Oh.

02:15.050 --> 02:16.720
That's why we have these.

02:16.750 --> 02:18.620
Oh.
How's that work?

02:18.650 --> 02:20.060
You find a member
to sponsor you,

02:20.090 --> 02:21.630
come have some drinks
with the committee,

02:21.660 --> 02:22.960
and they vote a few people in.

02:22.990 --> 02:25.400
Similar process to a secret
cheer society I was in.

02:25.430 --> 02:26.460
Skull and Pom-Poms.

02:26.490 --> 02:27.900
I've said too much already.

02:27.930 --> 02:29.400
Are you thinking of joining?

02:29.430 --> 02:30.970
Both my partners are in clubs.

02:31.000 --> 02:32.040
They've drummed up
a lot of business.

02:32.070 --> 02:33.070
Maybe I...

02:33.100 --> 02:34.470
Hey, there's Jay.
Maybe he can...

02:34.500 --> 02:35.970
Jay. Jay!

02:36.000 --> 02:37.810
Jay, Jay, Jay!

02:37.840 --> 02:38.980
Go, go, go!

02:39.010 --> 02:40.340
Jay, wait up!

02:40.370 --> 02:42.010
I think
someone's calling for you.

02:42.040 --> 02:43.380
I didn't hear anything.
What's wrong with this cart?

02:43.410 --> 02:45.750
You got the brakes on?
Go!
Ow! Your spikes.

02:45.780 --> 02:47.380
Hey, hey, hey!
Cramps.

02:47.410 --> 02:49.690
Luke and I
just split a Beef Wellington

02:49.720 --> 02:50.820
and clams casino.

02:50.850 --> 02:52.390
Um, I'm wondering
if you'd, uh, sponsor me

02:52.420 --> 02:53.860
for the new-members thing
tonight.

02:53.890 --> 02:55.430
Gee, I'd like to,
but they got rules

02:55.460 --> 02:57.090
about relatives
sponsoring new members, so...

02:57.120 --> 02:58.600
No, they don't.
I just did it.

02:58.630 --> 03:00.030
Gee,
they must have changed that.

03:00.060 --> 03:01.730
Oh, great, I'll see you tonight.
What time should I be here?

03:01.760 --> 03:03.400
Oh, I think it starts
about 9:30.

03:03.430 --> 03:05.600
No, it'll be over by then.
It starts at 7:00.

03:05.630 --> 03:07.270
They must have
changed that, too.

03:07.300 --> 03:09.040
Thanks, Jay.
See you at 7:00.

03:09.070 --> 03:11.040
Wait, that was
Claire's husband, right?

03:11.070 --> 03:13.510
Yes, it was, Anders,
you stupid ice

03:13.540 --> 03:16.580
I haven't had one night
to myself in six months,

03:16.610 --> 03:19.250
but tonight,
Manny's going to a party.

03:19.280 --> 03:22.420
And if I can get Joe
tired enough to go to sleep,

03:22.450 --> 03:25.890
I can finally relax
and take a long, nice bath.

03:25.920 --> 03:28.860
I even have a wine glass
that floats.

03:28.890 --> 03:32.230
In case I fall asleep,
nothing bad can happen.

03:32.260 --> 03:34.060
Ohh.
Okay,
little reindeer,

03:34.090 --> 03:36.200
we didn't get
to the North Pole yet.

03:36.230 --> 03:37.200
Ooh.

03:37.230 --> 03:39.070
I'm tired of this game.

03:40.430 --> 03:42.970
Well, we need to take this food
to Santa Claus.

03:43.000 --> 03:44.940
If not,
he's gonna starve to death.

03:44.970 --> 03:46.210
Which shirt for the party...

03:46.240 --> 03:47.610
The canary or the daffodil?

03:47.640 --> 03:49.210
We're not doing this again.

03:49.240 --> 03:51.420
I just the herringbone
or the tweed for your vest.

03:51.450 --> 03:53.250
Just pick one and go.

03:53.280 --> 03:55.590
Okay.
Oh, well, this needs ironing.

03:55.620 --> 03:57.050
Okay, jump on.

03:57.080 --> 03:59.890
Rudolph, to the laundry room!

03:59.920 --> 04:00.990
Ohh.

04:02.660 --> 04:04.290
I know it's just
community theater,

04:04.320 --> 04:06.130
but aren't opening nights
so exciting?

04:06.160 --> 04:07.600
Yes, the cream of society

04:07.630 --> 04:09.930
decked out
in their finest flip-flops.
Mitchell.

04:09.960 --> 04:12.070
Oh, my God, I can't believe it.

04:12.100 --> 04:14.900
I haven't seen you
since high school!

04:14.930 --> 04:17.570
Uh, yes, it's been years,
huh, uh, T-T-Tammy.

04:17.600 --> 04:19.279
Hey, let me know

04:19.310 --> 04:20.640
if you want to roll around
under the bleachers again, doll.

04:20.670 --> 04:21.649
Oh.

04:21.680 --> 04:23.450
Oh.

04:23.480 --> 04:25.350
That's weird... I feel like
I would've remembered her.

04:25.380 --> 04:26.850
Why was she wearing
a name tag?
I don't know.

04:26.880 --> 04:28.320
Oh, there he is!

04:28.350 --> 04:29.450
Remember that time in band

04:29.480 --> 04:30.950
when you dropped your flute
in the gutter?

04:30.980 --> 04:32.820
I'm sorry... I never played
the flute or anything...

04:32.850 --> 04:34.450
Ha!
Old gutter flute.

04:36.720 --> 04:38.360
Okay, what is going on?

04:38.390 --> 04:39.830
Why is everyone talking to me?

04:39.860 --> 04:42.200
I think
they're just being friendly.
Cam, oh, my God.

04:42.230 --> 04:44.800
Is... is this one of those
interactive theater experiences?

04:44.830 --> 04:47.000
Oh, do you mean
where the audience participates

04:47.030 --> 04:49.340
and the line between
performer and spectator

04:49.370 --> 04:50.810
is delightfully blurred?

04:50.840 --> 04:53.810
Mitchell, we're at
a high-school reunion!

04:53.840 --> 04:55.950
Stop pretending, all right?
You tricked me.

04:55.980 --> 04:56.980
I did not.
You always trick me.

04:57.010 --> 04:58.350
Every time we leave the house,

04:58.380 --> 05:00.020
it's like a game
of Three-card Monte.

05:00.050 --> 05:01.520
Interactive theater is fun.

05:01.550 --> 05:03.190
It's not fun.
It's never fun.

05:03.220 --> 05:04.550
It's the worst thing
that can happen to human

05:04.580 --> 05:05.860
during peace time.

05:05.890 --> 05:07.060
Okay, you know what, Mitchell?

05:07.090 --> 05:08.060
Please, I'm on the board,

05:08.090 --> 05:09.690
and I couldn't
not bring my husband

05:09.720 --> 05:11.230
while everyone else's
significant other

05:11.260 --> 05:12.560
is happy to be here.

05:12.590 --> 05:14.130
It's interactive?

05:14.160 --> 05:15.830
You son of a bitch.

05:15.860 --> 05:17.500
There's a quote for your poster.

05:22.700 --> 05:24.740
Front door open.
Ay, no!

05:24.770 --> 05:26.980
Please. Who?! Who?!

05:27.010 --> 05:29.380
Ay, what the hell
are you doing here?

05:29.410 --> 05:32.180
I had the most humiliating
experience of my entire life.

05:32.210 --> 05:33.880
I may never
leave this house again.

05:33.910 --> 05:35.220
Okay, you're just tired.

05:35.250 --> 05:36.820
I'm gonna make you an espresso,
and you go back.

05:36.850 --> 05:38.150
No, I can't go back there.

05:38.180 --> 05:40.590
Did you get in trouble again
for adjusting the lighting?

05:40.620 --> 05:41.860
You're still young.

05:41.890 --> 05:43.260
You can take a bright bulb.

05:43.290 --> 05:44.860
I was flirting with Ava Morris,

05:44.890 --> 05:46.230
and I walked into a coffee table

05:46.260 --> 05:47.600
and hit my shin really hard

05:47.630 --> 05:49.370
and started crying
in front of everyone.

05:49.400 --> 05:51.100
Bad enough...
But then I noticed

05:51.130 --> 05:53.070
I spilled my drink
on my crotch area,

05:53.100 --> 05:55.240
creating
a very incriminating stain.

05:55.270 --> 05:57.710
I ran to the bathroom and
started drying it with a towel,

05:57.740 --> 05:58.880
but the door swung open,

05:58.910 --> 06:00.410
and I was viewed
by my classmates

06:00.440 --> 06:02.180
vigorously attending
to my groin.

06:02.210 --> 06:04.680
Oh, and did I mention
the picture of Ava's grandmother

06:04.710 --> 06:07.250
water skiing in a bikini
that was directly in my eyeline?

06:07.280 --> 06:09.090
That happens to everyone
sometimes.

06:09.120 --> 06:10.550
You're gonna be fine
once you drink...

06:10.580 --> 06:12.020
Ay, no!

06:12.050 --> 06:13.550
Hi, Mama!
Hi, Mama! Hi, Mama!

06:16.990 --> 06:19.300
In the workplace,
we women have been told

06:19.330 --> 06:23.230
to suppress it,
contain it, ignore it.

06:23.260 --> 06:24.730
Well, you know what I say?

06:24.760 --> 06:26.240
Grab it!
Grab it.

06:26.270 --> 06:28.140
Alex is not
my most expressive child,

06:28.170 --> 06:30.040
but when she enrolled
in a business class

06:30.070 --> 06:31.810
and then signed up
for a lecture series

06:31.840 --> 06:33.480
called "Meet the She-E-O,"

06:33.510 --> 06:36.950
it was pretty clear to me
what she was trying to say...

06:36.980 --> 06:38.450
"I admire you, Mom."

06:38.480 --> 06:40.220
So, what do you think?
Quiet.

06:40.250 --> 06:41.920
I think...
Stop talking.

06:41.950 --> 06:43.420
I mean, sure, it was tough...

06:43.450 --> 06:45.260
Raising three kids
and running a business.

06:45.290 --> 06:48.160
But when the chance
to be She-E-O arose,

06:48.970 --> 06:51.340
I had only one thought.

06:51.480 --> 06:52.560
Grab it. Grab it.
Grab it. Grab it.

06:52.580 --> 06:54.160
I get it.
I grabbed it.

06:54.180 --> 06:55.800
I will move my seat.

06:55.820 --> 06:58.200
A mother knows
how to read between the lines.

06:58.220 --> 07:00.800
Alex's mouth may have said,
"You're embarrassing me."

07:00.820 --> 07:04.210
But her heart was saying,
"You're inspiring me."

07:04.230 --> 07:05.910
"Leave me alone."

07:05.930 --> 07:07.510
"Show me the way."

07:07.530 --> 07:09.580
"Are you still talking?"

07:09.600 --> 07:12.050
"Never stop rocking."

07:12.070 --> 07:14.180
Okay, first question.

07:14.200 --> 07:16.150
Ah, right up front.

07:16.170 --> 07:17.220
Hi. Hi.

07:17.240 --> 07:19.020
Hi, I'm Alex.

07:19.040 --> 07:20.540
Long-time reader,
first-time grabber.

07:21.680 --> 07:23.230
Anyway, I'm a biochemistry major
and CalTech,

07:23.250 --> 07:25.330
but your book got me thinking
about a business career.

07:25.350 --> 07:26.830
And now I'm considering
double-majoring,

07:26.850 --> 07:30.030
but is that taking on
a little too much?

07:30.050 --> 07:31.500
Alex, look at me.

07:31.520 --> 07:34.340
If you can think it,
you can grab it.

07:34.360 --> 07:35.940
Aah! Oh, my God!

07:35.960 --> 07:37.840
You're my hero, Nancy.
Thank you.

07:37.860 --> 07:38.670
Who's next?

07:38.690 --> 07:40.410
Hmm?

07:40.430 --> 07:42.250
I've got a...
Just a quick comment.

07:42.270 --> 07:44.450
Um, I also raised
three children,

07:44.470 --> 07:46.850
and I am the She-E-O
of a large company.

07:46.870 --> 07:48.020
And I got to say,

07:48.040 --> 07:49.550
it's like
looking a mirror, Nancy.

07:49.570 --> 07:51.220
That's great.
What's the company?

07:51.240 --> 07:53.060
Pritchett's Closets and Blinds.

07:53.080 --> 07:54.790
You sell closets and blinds?

07:54.810 --> 07:56.230
Mm-hmm.

07:56.250 --> 07:58.530
I could understand shutters
and blinds or closets and...

07:58.550 --> 07:59.960
We're good, Nancy.

07:59.980 --> 08:03.600
What I wanted to talk about
was how on page 1 of your book,

08:03.620 --> 08:06.700
you say you had hard time
not bringing your work home.

08:06.720 --> 08:08.740
That was just a joke.

08:08.760 --> 08:11.040
As you remember, my business
was started in my garage.

08:11.060 --> 08:12.610
Ah.

08:12.630 --> 08:16.080
So, you know how it's not
just family time that matters.

08:16.100 --> 08:17.780
It's quality family time.

08:17.800 --> 08:19.320
I agree.

08:19.340 --> 08:21.450
That's why I home-school
all three of my children.

08:21.470 --> 08:23.620
The conference table
in our boardroom

08:23.640 --> 08:25.590
actually rests
on their play structure.

08:25.610 --> 08:27.410
What am I saying?
Stand up, kids?

08:28.440 --> 08:30.590
Aww! Aww!
Aww! Aww!

08:30.610 --> 08:32.059
So, three daddies?

08:32.080 --> 08:33.159
You sound insane!

08:33.179 --> 08:34.380
All right.

08:35.950 --> 08:37.799
Hey, Pritch,
isn't that your gay son?

08:37.820 --> 08:38.799
Son-in-law.

08:38.820 --> 08:41.270
You've got
a gay son-in-law, too?

08:41.289 --> 08:44.130
I'm not doing this dance
with you guys again.

08:45.460 --> 08:47.810
I don't know
what I was worried about.

08:47.830 --> 08:50.280
All I had to do
was let Phil be Phil.

08:50.300 --> 08:51.950
He'd never get past the vote.

08:51.970 --> 08:54.620
Fortunately, clueless boobs
are one group

08:54.640 --> 08:57.420
the Supreme Court
can't force us to let in.

08:57.440 --> 08:59.090
So, tell us
about yourself, Phil.

08:59.110 --> 09:02.460
Well, uh, you and I have
something in common, actually.

09:02.480 --> 09:04.130
We're both Congressmen.

09:04.150 --> 09:05.760
Go on, with that, Phil.

09:05.780 --> 09:07.700
You're in the state congress,

09:07.720 --> 09:09.970
and I was in
the Junior Tumbling Congress.

09:09.990 --> 09:11.800
I was in Tumbling Congress.

09:11.820 --> 09:13.000
You trampoline?

09:13.020 --> 09:15.020
I'm on my tramp
like three nights a week!

09:16.730 --> 09:18.530
The rest of the time,
I'm... I'm with my wife.

09:25.730 --> 09:27.720
So, I go back to the seller

09:27.740 --> 09:30.450
with an all-cash
no-contingency offer

09:30.470 --> 09:31.820
that'd pay off
both his mortgages

09:31.840 --> 09:33.460
and leave enough
after capital gains

09:33.480 --> 09:35.290
to put a down payment
on a condo.

09:35.310 --> 09:37.530
I give him an hour
or I'm pulling the offer.

09:37.550 --> 09:39.730
I love this story.
It's like a western.

09:39.750 --> 09:41.060
It was a nightmare.

09:41.080 --> 09:44.130
Tumbling stories, bad jokes,
and they ate it up!

09:44.150 --> 09:46.000
I'd say they were being polite,

09:46.020 --> 09:47.800
but I've personally seen
two of those guys

09:47.820 --> 09:49.810
hit pedestrians
and not even slow down!

09:49.830 --> 09:52.010
No, true story!
True story.

09:52.030 --> 09:53.080
One second.

09:53.100 --> 09:54.740
These guys are great.

09:54.760 --> 09:56.150
Listen.

09:56.170 --> 09:58.010
You need one more move
to drive this home,

09:58.030 --> 09:59.220
and I'm thinking,

09:59.240 --> 10:01.680
what does Phil
bring to the party no else does?

10:01.700 --> 10:02.920
Magic.

10:02.940 --> 10:04.490
Are you sure?
I'm a little rusty.

10:04.510 --> 10:05.550
My money's on you.

10:05.570 --> 10:07.020
Go big, then go home.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.720
Sounded like you said...
Hey, everybody!

10:08.740 --> 10:10.090
Phil's gonna do
a little magic trick for you.

10:10.110 --> 10:11.660
Okay, uh...

10:11.680 --> 10:15.200
This one is for
all of the lawyers in the room

10:15.220 --> 10:18.770
because you're so good
at making our money...

10:18.790 --> 10:20.040
disappear.

10:20.060 --> 10:21.770
Oh, hold on.

10:21.790 --> 10:24.210
Um...

10:24.230 --> 10:27.340
Congressman Morley,
enough with the taxes.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.450
You don't see us
making you pay...

10:29.470 --> 10:30.550
through the nose.

10:30.570 --> 10:31.850
Okay, hold on.
Nobody move, I got this!

10:31.870 --> 10:32.900
Oh!

10:47.550 --> 10:50.600
Who am I kidding?
I can't fall asleep.

10:50.620 --> 10:52.440
Every car alarm,
every whistle of the wind

10:52.460 --> 10:54.400
sounds like
people laughing at me.

10:54.420 --> 10:55.930
It's all in your imagination.

10:59.060 --> 11:00.640
I just want to Netflix and Mom.

11:00.660 --> 11:02.950
Manny, you don't understand.

11:02.970 --> 11:05.950
An hour ago,
I had made the perfect tub!

11:05.970 --> 11:07.780
Yeah, thanks again for that,
but it didn't help.

11:07.800 --> 11:08.780
Sugar!

11:08.800 --> 11:09.990
I love sugar!

11:10.010 --> 11:11.490
Okay, that is it!

11:11.510 --> 11:13.990
You don't want to go to sleep!

11:14.010 --> 11:15.720
And you don't want
to go to the party!

11:15.740 --> 11:17.230
Then I'm canceling
the nighttime!

11:17.250 --> 11:18.230
Mom?

11:18.250 --> 11:19.900
You heard me.
It's tomorrow.

11:19.920 --> 11:21.000
We're going to school.

11:21.020 --> 11:22.600
Wait for me in the car.

11:22.620 --> 11:24.000
Hey, Jay.

11:24.020 --> 11:25.400
If you get this, please come...

11:25.420 --> 11:27.790
No one can help you now!

11:29.190 --> 11:31.070
Yo, looks like everyone made it.

11:31.090 --> 11:32.310
But where's Vlad?

11:32.330 --> 11:34.410
The exchange student
from Latvia?

11:34.430 --> 11:35.610
I haven't seen him.

11:35.630 --> 11:38.180
I'd love to catch up
with that dreamboat.

11:38.200 --> 11:41.080
So much has happened
since high school.

11:41.100 --> 11:42.620
Alcoholism.

11:42.640 --> 11:46.190
I tried to find happiness
in the bottom of a bottle.

11:46.210 --> 11:49.190
A shattering depiction
of human suffering.

11:49.210 --> 11:51.430
But enough about how I felt.

11:51.450 --> 11:53.460
I just keep remembering
how Vlad and I

11:53.480 --> 11:55.200
had the best time
in high school.

11:55.220 --> 11:58.770
For some of us,
that was the last best time.

11:58.790 --> 12:00.000
Vietnam.

12:00.020 --> 12:01.470
Oof.

12:01.490 --> 12:03.370
What time period
was all this taking place?

12:03.390 --> 12:05.670
It didn't make any sense.

12:05.690 --> 12:08.140
The way things ended
with me and Vlad,

12:08.160 --> 12:09.450
it still haunts me.

12:09.470 --> 12:11.980
A lot of things haunt me.

12:12.000 --> 12:14.480
It was the night of the prom.

12:14.500 --> 12:16.150
Car accident.
Shh.

12:16.170 --> 12:17.690
The roads were very icy.

12:17.710 --> 12:20.060
Car accident.
You don't know.

12:20.080 --> 12:23.160
Through the mist,
I saw the truck's headlights.

12:23.180 --> 12:26.700
When I came to, the doctor
told me we'd been in a horrible

12:26.720 --> 12:28.030
car accident!
Car accident.

12:28.050 --> 12:29.970
Oh, you've got to be kidding me.

12:29.990 --> 12:32.200
Mitchell, this is the theater.
Have some respect.

12:32.220 --> 12:34.670
All you have to do
is sit there and be quiet.

12:34.690 --> 12:37.010
Tammy, you are never
gonna believe who's here.

12:37.030 --> 12:38.810
Who?
Vlad.

12:38.830 --> 12:40.580
Oh, my God, where?

12:40.600 --> 12:41.860
Out there.

12:45.530 --> 12:49.740
There he is.
That's Vlad.

12:55.010 --> 12:56.190
I swear I didn't know
they were gonna pick you.

12:56.210 --> 12:57.430
They probably
assumed you were fun

12:57.450 --> 13:00.000
because you were with me.
They didn't know.

13:00.020 --> 13:02.400
Vlad, come up here.

13:02.420 --> 13:03.830
Move your country ass.
I'm... I'm leaving.

13:03.850 --> 13:05.030
No, no.

13:05.050 --> 13:06.340
Just go up there, hug Tammy,

13:06.360 --> 13:08.170
and wait
for the surprise ending.

13:08.190 --> 13:09.870
I don't care about
the surprise ending!

13:09.890 --> 13:11.340
You go be Vlad.

13:11.360 --> 13:13.610
I can't be Vlad because
I am the surprise ending.

13:13.630 --> 13:15.410
What?
And it's a show-stopper.

13:15.430 --> 13:16.680
I've been rehearsing for weeks.

13:16.700 --> 13:18.580
Now, just stop being selfish
and get up there.

13:18.600 --> 13:19.580
Just do it!

13:19.600 --> 13:21.420
We all want to get out of here!

13:21.440 --> 13:22.570
Vlad.

13:25.810 --> 13:28.060
I didn't know how,
I didn't know when,

13:28.080 --> 13:29.260
but I was gonna get him.

13:29.280 --> 13:32.030
Vladdie, sweetie, you're here.

13:32.050 --> 13:33.900
Oh, you're really here.

13:33.920 --> 13:35.200
Not okay.

13:35.220 --> 13:36.770
Oh, what a happy ending.

13:36.790 --> 13:37.890
I'll say.

13:39.120 --> 13:40.400
Okay, okay.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.040
That...
That is your gum.

13:42.060 --> 13:43.240
What a great reunion.

13:43.260 --> 13:44.970
Yeah, everybody made it.

13:44.990 --> 13:46.410
Almost everybody.

13:46.430 --> 13:47.610
Oh.

13:47.630 --> 13:48.940
Hello, students!

13:48.960 --> 13:50.880
Janitor Joe!
Janitor Joe! Janitor Joe!

13:50.900 --> 13:53.420
Or should I say farewell?

13:53.440 --> 13:55.440
All of a sudden, I knew how.

13:56.470 --> 13:58.620
Hello again, students.

13:58.640 --> 14:02.660
Or should I say farewell?

14:02.680 --> 14:04.330
And I knew when.

14:04.350 --> 14:06.760
Wait, wait, does...
Does anybody else

14:06.780 --> 14:08.060
see his ghost right now?

14:08.080 --> 14:09.300
What?

14:09.320 --> 14:10.800
Yeah, who could forget

14:10.820 --> 14:13.640
how he courageously
showed up to our 25th

14:13.660 --> 14:16.470
and then... and then died
in front of all of us.

14:16.490 --> 14:18.110
No, I'm about to die right now.

14:18.130 --> 14:20.010
Mm-hmm, in fact, I...
I remember his death

14:20.030 --> 14:22.280
went a little something
like... like this.

14:22.300 --> 14:25.010
I've lived a long life.

14:25.030 --> 14:27.180
Mitchell,
what are you doing?
Many friends.

14:27.200 --> 14:29.440
Oh, my beautiful Bess.

14:30.770 --> 14:33.590
Even took a trip
to Washington, D.C.,

14:33.610 --> 14:36.130
and had my picture made
with the Congressman.

14:36.150 --> 14:38.650
Never had any children,
of course.

14:40.180 --> 14:43.970
Which is why it was so important
that I made it here tonight.

14:43.990 --> 14:45.970
To see each of you.

14:45.990 --> 14:50.440
You are my children!

14:50.460 --> 14:53.610
And I want to leave you
with this one last thing.

14:53.630 --> 14:54.810
Do not go gentle...

14:54.830 --> 14:56.980
Do not go gentle
into that good night.

14:57.000 --> 14:58.710
Rage!

14:58.730 --> 15:04.640
Rage against
the dying of the light!

15:07.180 --> 15:10.050
And I don't feel good either.

15:12.220 --> 15:14.530
Yeah, good save.

15:14.550 --> 15:16.470
Find anything on "Grab It" lady?

15:16.490 --> 15:18.570
"Nancy Decker lawsuit"...
Nope.

15:18.590 --> 15:21.200
"Nancy Decker nose job"...
Nope.

15:21.220 --> 15:23.810
"Nancy Decker kills..."...
Oh!

15:23.830 --> 15:26.210
"at CEO
comedy night."

15:26.230 --> 15:28.410
Hello, we're here.

15:28.430 --> 15:29.750
Gloria?

15:29.770 --> 15:31.010
Haley, you remember that day

15:31.030 --> 15:33.380
when you said
that if I ever needed a nanny,

15:33.400 --> 15:35.250
you would love
to take care of Joe?

15:35.270 --> 15:36.890
Well,
here you go.
No, no.

15:36.910 --> 15:38.520
You can keep him
for as long as you want.

15:38.540 --> 15:39.820
Thank you.

15:39.840 --> 15:42.690
Uh, no, uh, that doesn't really
sound like me,

15:42.710 --> 15:45.230
plus I have a 9-to-5 job now,
so bye.

15:45.250 --> 15:46.360
Please take me with you.

15:46.380 --> 15:47.860
What's going on?

15:47.880 --> 15:49.060
Mama's crazy.

15:49.080 --> 15:50.230
I am not crazy!

15:50.250 --> 15:52.540
I just canceled the night.

15:52.560 --> 15:54.840
Manny, maybe you could
help out here.

15:54.860 --> 15:56.740
Mom's upset
because Joe won't go to sleep

15:56.760 --> 15:58.370
and I won't go back to a party.

15:58.390 --> 16:00.210
You won't go back
to a party? Why?

16:00.230 --> 16:03.410
I suffered an unfortunate series
of embarrassing incidents.

16:03.430 --> 16:06.420
I just want a wine bath
and to go to sleep.

16:06.440 --> 16:07.780
Listen up, Manny.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.350
Of course you want to run away

16:09.370 --> 16:11.050
from whatever happened
back that party.

16:11.070 --> 16:12.560
Anybody would.

16:12.580 --> 16:16.230
But that just guarantees
that it sticks with you forever.

16:16.250 --> 16:20.630
But if you march back in there
and you own it,

16:20.650 --> 16:22.800
you let those people know
that you're better than them,

16:22.820 --> 16:24.900
and you will be a legend.

16:24.920 --> 16:26.470
Okay.
Yeah.

16:26.490 --> 16:27.540
Okay.

16:27.560 --> 16:30.040
You, get on the couch,
go to sleep.

16:30.060 --> 16:31.710
But I'm not tired.

16:31.730 --> 16:34.040
Don't care.
Five, four, three...

16:34.060 --> 16:35.440
Okay, I'm going!

16:35.460 --> 16:37.610
Two...
"Okay, I'm going"?

16:37.630 --> 16:40.550
I spend hours trying,
and then you just come one...

16:40.570 --> 16:43.790
The only thing I did
was not be their mother.

16:43.810 --> 16:46.760
Look, I don't get it either,
but for some reason...

16:46.780 --> 16:49.260
the kids respond
better to other adults.

16:49.280 --> 16:51.160
Yeah, but that's not fair.

16:51.180 --> 16:52.960
Well, most of being a parent
isn't fair.

16:52.980 --> 16:54.430
Right now, Alex is obsessed

16:54.450 --> 16:56.830
with some
CEO business woman author

16:56.850 --> 17:00.000
who's basically
an older-looking version of me.

17:00.020 --> 17:01.270
We're the same age, by the way.

17:01.290 --> 17:02.910
You know that Alex
look up to you, right?

17:02.930 --> 17:04.740
Not by anything she says, no.

17:04.760 --> 17:06.280
Yeah, they never say it.

17:06.300 --> 17:07.839
I guess they think

17:07.859 --> 17:10.450
that they're giving the parents
too much power.

17:10.470 --> 17:13.250
They find little ways
to express it.

17:13.270 --> 17:15.150
Being a mom
is like being a model.

17:15.170 --> 17:17.190
You have to learn
how to live on crumbs.

17:17.210 --> 17:18.210
Hmm.

17:19.880 --> 17:20.920
Hi, honey.

17:20.940 --> 17:23.490
Hey.

17:23.510 --> 17:26.599
Right.

17:26.619 --> 17:29.700
Honey, I'm so sorry about
the way I was tonight.

17:29.720 --> 17:31.000
It's okay.

17:31.020 --> 17:33.200
I actually got to go backstage
and meet Nancy.

17:33.220 --> 17:35.370
She invited a few of us
out for coffee.

17:35.390 --> 17:36.840
Oh, fun.

17:36.860 --> 17:39.440
Yeah, no, uh, not fun, actually.

17:39.460 --> 17:40.810
All she did
was talk about herself.

17:40.830 --> 17:42.810
It really just seemed like
she wanted an audience.

17:42.830 --> 17:45.450
And when the check came,
you know what she didn't do?

17:45.470 --> 17:46.450
Grab it.

17:46.470 --> 17:47.450
Sorry.

17:47.470 --> 17:49.050
Joe's sleeping in the couch.

17:49.070 --> 17:50.910
Can he stay here?
Okay, thank you so much.

17:52.210 --> 17:54.820
Well, I mean,
the night wasn't a total waste.

17:54.840 --> 17:56.690
After she left,
I sat there thinking,

17:56.710 --> 17:58.130
"Why am I taking
a business course anyway?"

17:58.150 --> 17:59.860
I should go out in the world
and do something.

17:59.880 --> 18:02.200
So I saw a help-wanted sign
in the coffee shop

18:02.220 --> 18:03.900
and got a job as a barista.

18:03.920 --> 18:04.870
Really?

18:04.890 --> 18:06.170
Yeah, I start tomorrow.

18:06.190 --> 18:07.540
I'm excited.

18:07.560 --> 18:09.340
I just thought,
why not get out there

18:09.360 --> 18:10.570
and get my hands
a little dirty, you know?

18:10.590 --> 18:11.840
Mm-hmm.

18:11.860 --> 18:13.840
Good night.

18:13.860 --> 18:15.960
Good night.

18:23.510 --> 18:25.150
Sauna over here.

18:25.170 --> 18:27.160
Hot tub that way.

18:27.180 --> 18:28.720
Legend has it that the holes

18:28.740 --> 18:30.560
in the individual
shower partitions

18:30.580 --> 18:31.830
were cigar holders.

18:31.850 --> 18:33.570
At least that's the story
we're sticking to.

18:34.420 --> 18:36.100
Follow me, folks.

18:36.120 --> 18:37.900
Ever been in here, Jay?

18:37.920 --> 18:39.840
This looks like a good place

18:39.860 --> 18:41.820
to sweat out some Peach Melba.

18:45.430 --> 18:47.030
Uh-oh.
What did you do?

18:47.900 --> 18:49.210
I'm stuck.

18:49.230 --> 18:50.680
I think there's a wet towel
wedged underneath the door.

18:50.700 --> 18:51.710
Could you pull on it?

18:51.730 --> 18:53.620
Is this gonna happen
all the time now?

18:53.640 --> 18:56.440
Me babysitting you
every minute of the day?

18:58.070 --> 18:59.290
It won't budge.

18:59.310 --> 19:01.790
Oh, wait, I think
I found the emergency button.

19:01.810 --> 19:03.260
No, no!
Okay!

19:03.280 --> 19:05.460
Jay, I'm trying not to panic.

19:05.480 --> 19:07.560
Stand back...
I'm gonna throw

19:07.580 --> 19:09.800
one of these emergency rocks
through the glass!

19:09.820 --> 19:11.900
Aah-aah!
That's hot!

19:11.920 --> 19:13.370
I'm texting the front desk.

19:13.390 --> 19:14.800
Listen, Phil, I can't do this.

19:14.820 --> 19:15.800
You're leaving me here?!

19:15.820 --> 19:18.410
No, I can't have you
at this club!

19:18.430 --> 19:19.980
This is my place, damn it.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.380
No!

19:21.400 --> 19:23.050
I'm sorry, Phil.

19:23.070 --> 19:24.480
Can't you find another club?

19:24.500 --> 19:26.150
I mean, look at my life.

19:26.170 --> 19:27.420
I mean, I built my house,

19:27.440 --> 19:29.220
and before I even lived in it,
I got married.

19:29.240 --> 19:30.320
And that's fantastic.

19:30.340 --> 19:31.790
And then I have my study,

19:31.810 --> 19:33.660
where I can close the door
and have a glass of Scotch.

19:33.680 --> 19:35.490
And now it's Joe's room,
and that's fantastic.

19:35.510 --> 19:37.490
But this is the only place
I have left

19:37.510 --> 19:39.150
that I don't have to share
with my family.

19:40.250 --> 19:42.400
I don't want to be that guy,
but did you send that text yet?

19:42.420 --> 19:44.130
The one place I feel special...

19:44.150 --> 19:46.400
They call me "Ace"
and "Jay Boy" and "Pritch."

19:46.420 --> 19:48.570
I'm not comfortable
other places, okay?

19:48.590 --> 19:50.410
But you...
You fit in everywhere.

19:50.430 --> 19:52.070
The whole world is you club!

19:52.090 --> 19:53.510
But I have this place!

19:53.530 --> 19:54.930
You get that, right?

20:01.840 --> 20:03.750
Maintenance arrived
one minute later

20:03.770 --> 20:05.450
and packed him in ice
from the seafood bar,

20:05.470 --> 20:06.510
and he was as good as new.

20:08.610 --> 20:09.690
How you feeling?

20:09.710 --> 20:10.990
Better.

20:11.010 --> 20:14.200
Jay, I was thinking about
what you said before.

20:14.220 --> 20:17.370
It was so honest and sensitive.

20:17.390 --> 20:18.530
And vulnerable.

20:18.550 --> 20:19.800
Hey.

20:19.820 --> 20:21.440
No one needs to know about that.

20:21.460 --> 20:23.370
Anyway, this is your club.

20:23.390 --> 20:25.210
I'm...
I'm dropping out.

20:25.230 --> 20:26.840
Well, you deserve it
just as much as I do.

20:26.860 --> 20:28.360
It's fine.

20:29.460 --> 20:31.610
I can't let you
give all this up.

20:31.630 --> 20:33.980
For God's sake,
there's the club chair

20:34.000 --> 20:36.650
Fatty Arbuckle
anxiously awaited his verdict.

20:36.670 --> 20:37.890
Jay, I mean it.

20:37.910 --> 20:39.890
Well, at least let me
give you something in return.

20:39.910 --> 20:40.890
You name it.

20:40.910 --> 20:42.120
Really?

20:42.140 --> 20:44.230
Yeah.
Well...

20:44.250 --> 20:46.500
I don't like
how happy you look right now.

20:46.520 --> 20:48.030
This is living, huh?

20:48.050 --> 20:50.500
How long
do we have this thing for?

20:50.520 --> 20:51.830
Only three hours.

20:51.850 --> 20:53.000
You saw the sign.

20:53.020 --> 20:54.570
Every bounce counts!

20:54.590 --> 20:55.570
Yes!

20:55.590 --> 20:57.160
Get you some!
Get it!

21:01.060 --> 21:05.480
The way things ended with me
and Vlad, it always haunted me.

21:05.500 --> 21:06.550
Cam wasn't wrong about this.

21:06.570 --> 21:07.650
We paid for the whole seat,

21:07.670 --> 21:09.180
but we're only using
the edge of it.

21:09.200 --> 21:10.890
You know,
I only owe you so much.

21:10.910 --> 21:12.720
You don't get
an unlimited number of these.

21:12.740 --> 21:15.590
Tammy, you are never
gonna believe who's here.

21:15.610 --> 21:17.060
Who?
Vlad.

21:17.080 --> 21:19.030
Oh, my God, where?

21:19.050 --> 21:20.160
Out there.

21:20.180 --> 21:23.030
I think might duck out early.

21:23.050 --> 21:25.530
There he is.
That's Vlad.

21:25.550 --> 21:26.920
Lucky!
