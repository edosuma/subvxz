00:01.458 --> 00:03.542
Announcer: PREVIOUSLY ON
DAWSON'S CREEK...

00:03.542 --> 00:04.625
YOU KISSED MY GIRLFRIEND.

00:04.625 --> 00:05.959
I DID. TRUTH IS,
I'D DO IT AGAIN.

00:07.041 --> 00:08.834
AFTER EVERYTHING
WE'VE BEEN THROUGH,

00:08.834 --> 00:09.458
YOU WANT TO GO BACK
TO BEING FRIENDS?

00:09.458 --> 00:11.792
YEAH.

00:11.792 --> 00:13.834
IF YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY THAT CAN'T HAPPEN,

00:13.834 --> 00:15.583
IF YOU DON'T GET THAT,
YOU DON'T GET ME.

00:15.583 --> 00:18.166
YOUR MOTHER AND I
HAVE DECIDED TO SPEND
SOME TIME APART.

00:18.166 --> 00:22.000
NOW, THIS IS A CONCLUSION
THAT WE'VE REACHED.

00:22.000 --> 00:24.333
WELL, I CONCLUDE THAT
YOUR CONCLUSION SUCKS.

00:24.333 --> 00:27.333
YOU'RE AWARE
THAT HIS GOAL IS TO
SLEEP WITH YOU TONIGHT?

00:27.333 --> 00:27.750
ARE WE ON
THE SAME PAGE?

00:27.750 --> 00:29.208
SAME PAGE.

00:32.208 --> 00:33.500
WELL, I GUESS
THE GENTLEMEN

00:33.500 --> 00:35.458
ARE IN A PRETTY TALL HURRY
TO GET ME OUT OF HERE.

00:35.458 --> 00:38.291
AND THE WAY THE EVIDENCE
IS PILED UP AGAINST ME,

00:38.291 --> 00:39.834
I CAN'T SAY
I BLAME THEM MUCH.

00:39.834 --> 00:41.125
AND I'M QUITE WILLING
TO GO, SIR,

00:41.125 --> 00:42.375
WHEN THEY
VOTED THAT WAY...

00:42.375 --> 00:43.875
MIND IF I HAVE
THESE EXTRA PEPPERONIS?

00:43.875 --> 00:46.542
SHH!
FOR THE 10th TIME.

00:46.542 --> 00:48.166

THE CRUSHED PEPPER.

DRIVING ME CRAZY.

00:50.125 --> 00:51.041
I'M A HUNGRY PERSON.

00:51.041 --> 00:52.375
YOU'RE
AN ANNOYING PERSON.

00:52.375 --> 00:53.542
A BORED PERSON.

00:53.542 --> 00:55.000
MR. SMITH GOES
TO WASHINGTON,  DAWSON?

00:55.000 --> 00:57.291
COME ON, IT'S IN
BLACK AND WHITE.

00:57.291 --> 00:58.750
IT'S A FRANK CAPRA
CLASSIC.

00:58.750 --> 01:00.208
WITH A BUNCH
OF DEAD PEOPLE IN IT.

01:00.208 --> 01:02.375
EVERYBODY IN THIS MOVIE
IS DECOMPOSING SOMEWHERE.

01:02.375 --> 01:03.458
IT'S MORBID.

01:03.458 --> 01:05.375
WE GOT THIS WHOLE SECTION
AT THE VIDEO STORE.

01:05.375 --> 01:07.083
IT'S CALLED NEW RELEASES.
CHECK IT OUT.

01:07.083 --> 01:09.542
THIS IS A TIMELESS TALE
ABOUT A MAN FACED WITH
HIS HEROIC NATURE.

01:09.542 --> 01:12.875
I CAN'T CONNECT
TO THE WHOLESOME
AND MORALLY GROUNDED.

01:12.875 --> 01:14.500
THAT'S MORE YOUR STYLE.
WHO YOU ARE.

01:14.500 --> 01:15.750
ARE YOU INSULTING ME?

01:15.750 --> 01:18.708
MM-MMM. YOU'RE
AN ENDANGERED SPECIES.

01:18.708 --> 01:20.583
THE LAST
OF A DYING BREED.

01:20.583 --> 01:23.041
THIS MOVIE IS
KILLING YOU SOFTLY
WITH ITS SONG.

01:23.041 --> 01:24.417
YOU ARE INSULTING ME.

01:24.417 --> 01:25.708
NO. I'M STATING
THE OBVIOUS.

01:25.708 --> 01:27.875

DAWSON.

ACROSS THE STREET.

01:30.083 --> 01:32.041
YOU JUST SAY NO.
YOU ARE JIMMY STEWART.

01:32.041 --> 01:32.333
WHAT DOES THAT
MAKE YOU?

01:34.917 --> 01:36.000
THE NEEDLESS WASTE,

01:36.000 --> 01:38.667
BORN TO WALK IN THE SHADOWS
OF GREATER MEN.

01:38.667 --> 01:40.500
SOMEBODY'S HAVING
A SELF-ESTEEM CRISIS.

01:40.500 --> 01:42.333
ON THE CONTRARY,
MY FRIEND.

01:42.333 --> 01:43.291
KNOWLEDGE IS POWER.

01:43.291 --> 01:45.166
I'M HAPPY WITH
MY BELOW-AVERAGE STATUS.

01:45.166 --> 01:46.041
[BANG]

01:46.041 --> 01:47.750
I DROPPED MY PURSE
IN YOUR HEDGE.

01:47.750 --> 01:50.125

01:50.125 --> 01:52.125

HI, PACEY.

01:52.125 --> 01:54.250
OHH!

01:54.250 --> 01:57.083
LOOKS LIKE
YOU GOT COMPANY.

01:57.083 --> 01:59.000
THIRD TIME THIS WEEK.

01:59.708 --> 02:02.625
COME HERE.
HELP ME OUT.

02:03.750 --> 02:06.834
ONCE AGAIN,
HERO DAWSON TO THE RESCUE.

02:06.834 --> 02:07.959
SHUT UP.

02:07.959 --> 02:09.875
IT'S NOT EXACTLY
THE IDEAL SITUATION.

02:09.875 --> 02:11.792
TOO BAD FOR YOU.

02:11.792 --> 02:13.000
OHH!

02:13.000 --> 02:15.625
UGH! I THINK
I'M GOING TO BE SICK.

02:15.625 --> 02:16.417

02:23.708 --> 02:24.250
FALSE ALARM.

02:32.166 --> 02:32.750
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO ABOUT HER.

02:32.750 --> 02:35.125
SHE'S SPIRALING.

02:35.125 --> 02:37.291
MAYBE YOU SHOULD JUST
FINISH WATCHING THE MOVIE.

02:37.291 --> 02:39.750
JIMMY STEWART WOULD
KNOW WHAT TO DO.

02:41.500 --> 02:43.458
TV: AND THIS SAME MAN,
MR. JAMES TAYLOR,

02:43.458 --> 02:44.750
CAME DOWN HERE
AND OFFERED ME--

03:51.000 --> 03:52.417
HEY. WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

03:52.417 --> 03:57.583
I WAS JUST, UH, PACKING UP
SOME MORE STUFF.

03:57.583 --> 03:59.708
MOVING OUT.

03:59.708 --> 04:01.333
OH.

04:02.375 --> 04:04.417
ACTUALLY,
I WAS GOING TO SEE

04:04.417 --> 04:05.875
IF YOU COULD GIVE ME
A HAND LATER.

04:05.875 --> 04:08.750
THEN I THOUGHT WE COULD
GRAB A BITE TO EAT,

04:08.750 --> 04:11.375
SPEND SOME TIME,
DO, LIKE, A FRIEND THING.

04:11.375 --> 04:12.583
UM...SURE.

04:12.583 --> 04:15.417
MIGHT HAVE TO SKIP ON
THE FRIEND THING, THOUGH.

04:15.417 --> 04:17.625
I HAVE REAL FRIENDS
FOR THAT.

04:19.041 --> 04:21.750
LOOK, DAWSON, I KNOW
THIS ISN'T EASY FOR YOU

04:21.750 --> 04:23.834
AND THAT YOU'RE
DISAPPOINTED IN ME.

04:23.834 --> 04:25.834

04:25.834 --> 04:28.041
I WISH THINGS COULD BE
DIFFERENT, BUT...

04:28.041 --> 04:30.083
THEY'RE NOT.

04:32.333 --> 04:34.500
I'M TRYING HERE,
DAWSON.

04:37.083 --> 04:38.542

AFTER SCHOOL, THEN?

04:38.542 --> 04:39.500

04:39.500 --> 04:41.083
OH, BEFORE I FORGET.

04:41.083 --> 04:42.542

MY MAIL YESTERDAY.

WHAT'S BEST FOR THIS FAMILY,

HOW MOVING OUT

IN THE RIGHT DIRECTION.

10:47.458 --> 10:49.375
I MEAN, EINSTEIN FAILED
THE 2nd GRADE

10:49.375 --> 10:50.875
AND NOT BECAUSE
HE WAS STUPID,

10:50.875 --> 10:52.166
BUT BECAUSE HE WAS BORED.

10:52.166 --> 10:55.041
AND THE INCOMPETENCY
OF AN INFERIOR
PUBLIC SCHOOL SYSTEM

10:55.041 --> 10:56.542
FAILED TO RECOGNIZE IT.

10:56.542 --> 11:00.458
THEY RATHER DISMISS SOMEONE
WHO'S IN OBVIOUS NEED
OF SOME GUIDANCE

11:00.458 --> 11:01.625
RATHER THAN
REACH OUT TO HIM.

11:01.625 --> 11:03.625
IF SOMEONE ALONG THE WAY

11:03.625 --> 11:05.375
HAD JUST TAKEN
2 SECONDS TO NOTICE,
TO CARE,

11:05.375 --> 11:06.458
THEY WOULD HAVE REALIZED

11:06.458 --> 11:10.333
THAT YOU NEEDED TO BE RESCUED,
NOT RIDICULED.

11:10.333 --> 11:12.917
LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,
ANDIE McPHEE.

11:17.375 --> 11:19.125
LINDLEY.

11:19.125 --> 11:21.542
HEY, YOU GUYS. I WAS
LOOKING FOR YOU EARLIER.

11:21.542 --> 11:24.000
IMPRESSIVE SHOWING
LAST NIGHT.

11:24.000 --> 11:24.667
I'M SURPRISED
TO SEE YOU HERE.

11:24.667 --> 11:27.125
WELL, I RECUPERATE WELL.

11:27.125 --> 11:27.667
HEY, DAWSON.

11:27.667 --> 11:29.542
WHAT'S UP, CHRIS?

11:29.542 --> 11:31.458
SO, LISTEN.
I GOT TO CONFESS.

11:31.458 --> 11:33.125
I AM ON A MISSION.
MMM.

11:33.125 --> 11:36.917
TODD HERE IS HAVING
A P-A-RTY TONIGHT.

11:36.917 --> 11:37.792
KEGS AND EGGS.
PARTY TILL BREAKFAST.

11:37.792 --> 11:39.875
WE'RE JUST GETTING
THE WORD OUT.

11:39.875 --> 11:41.583
WELL, YOU KNOW THAT
YOU CAN SIGN ME UP.

11:41.583 --> 11:43.166
EXCELLENT. SEE YOU THERE.

11:43.166 --> 11:44.500
ALL RIGHT.

11:45.333 --> 11:49.000
SO...WHAT'S YOUR DEAL
WITH THEM?

11:50.333 --> 11:51.417
I'VE JUST BEEN
HANGING OUT. WHAT?

11:51.417 --> 11:53.125
WELL, I--

11:53.125 --> 11:56.708
COME ON, DAWSON. SAVE ME
THE CHARACTER DISSECTION.

11:56.708 --> 11:59.959
AND WHILE WE'RE AT IT,
WHY DON'T YOU COME WITH ME?

12:00.500 --> 12:03.000
WELL, LET'S SEE.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.417
WE'VE GOT SCRIPTWRITING
CAREER ADVANCEMENT
ON ONE SIDE,

12:05.417 --> 12:07.000
USELESS DRUNK OBLIVION
ON THE OTHER.

12:07.000 --> 12:09.041
TSK.
THAT'S A TOUGH CALL.

12:09.041 --> 12:10.458
DON'T JUDGE ME, DAWSON.

12:10.458 --> 12:12.959
YOU DON'T WANT TO GO,
DON'T GO. THAT'S FINE.

12:12.959 --> 12:15.750
BUT JUST BECAUSE
I'M FINALLY ENJOYING MYSELF,

12:15.750 --> 12:18.708
YOU DON'T HAVE TO TREAT ME
LIKE I'VE BEEN LOST
TO THE OTHER SIDE.

12:18.708 --> 12:20.250
I'M NOT OUT OF CONTROL.

12:20.250 --> 12:21.834
ALL I'M DOING IS HAVING FUN.

12:21.834 --> 12:25.625
ALL RIGHT, IT'S
A SIMPLE 3-LETTER-WORD--
FUN, F-U-N.

12:25.625 --> 12:27.417
I DIDN'T SAY A WORD,
JEN.

12:31.750 --> 12:33.750
Andie: THIS ISN'T FUNNY,
PACEY.

12:33.750 --> 12:36.375
IT'S JUST THAT
YOUR ENTIRE FUTURE
IS ON THE LINE HERE,

12:36.375 --> 12:37.917
I THINK YOU SHOULD
BE MORE NERVOUS.

12:37.917 --> 12:40.083
YOU'RE SO NOT NERVOUS
THAT YOU'RE MAKING ME NERVOUS.

12:40.083 --> 12:41.708
NOW THAT MY POSTURING
AS VILLAGE IDIOT

12:41.708 --> 12:43.083
HAS BEEN DULY DOCUMENTED,

12:43.083 --> 12:45.291
I FEEL LIKE A WEIGHT'S
BEEN TAKEN OFF, YOU KNOW?

12:45.291 --> 12:47.041
IF THAT'S THE WAY
YOU PERCEIVE YOURSELF,

12:47.041 --> 12:48.750
THAT'S THE WAY
PEOPLE WILL LOOK AT YOU.

12:48.750 --> 12:51.125
IF YOU ACT LIKE A JOKER,
PEOPLE WILL TREAT YOU
LIKE ONE.

12:51.125 --> 12:52.959
FINALLY FIGURED IT OUT.

12:52.959 --> 12:54.333
I'M NOT LUKE SKYWALKER.

12:54.333 --> 12:55.959
I'M NOT EVEN LUKE PERRY.

12:55.959 --> 12:57.458
THERE'S NO HERO HERE,
ANDIE.

12:57.458 --> 12:59.208
I AM A JOKE.

12:59.208 --> 13:02.041
I'M NOT COMING
TO YOUR PITY PARTY.

13:02.041 --> 13:04.917
YOU KNOW I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE A JOKE, PACEY.

13:04.917 --> 13:05.875
IT'S TOO LATE.

13:05.875 --> 13:08.708
I'VE SPENT SO LONG
BEING A SCREW-UP,

13:08.708 --> 13:11.166
I'M PAST THE PROVERBIAL
POINT OF NO RETURN.

13:11.166 --> 13:12.750
BULL. CHANGE YOUR COURSE.
BREAK THE CHAIN.

13:12.750 --> 13:15.041
ANYONE CAN
REINVENT THEMSELVES.

13:15.041 --> 13:17.208
IT'S AMERICA.
MADONNA DOES IT EVERY WEEK.

13:19.291 --> 13:21.792
BUT I DON'T KNOW HOW.

13:24.166 --> 13:25.959
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE TO START.

13:25.959 --> 13:27.917
TRY STARTING
FROM THE INSIDE.

13:27.917 --> 13:30.708
I MEAN, ANYONE
CAN CHANGE THEIR FATE.

13:30.708 --> 13:34.583
HEROES ARE MADE, NOT BORN.

13:50.625 --> 13:54.041
AHEM. WELCOME TO
CHEZ CAFETERIA.

13:54.041 --> 13:58.333
ONE OF OUR SPECIALS TONIGHT
IS A CHATEAUBRIAND FOR TWO,

13:58.333 --> 14:03.000
WITH A SIDE
OF BRAISED BABY CARROTS
ON A BED OF SPRING LETTUCE,

14:03.000 --> 14:04.125
WHICH I HIGHLY
RECOMMEND.

14:04.125 --> 14:06.083
NOW, WE HAVE SOME OTHER
SPECIALS TONIGHT,

14:06.083 --> 14:08.208
WHICH INCLUDE SOME
REDDISH-YELLOW STUFF
DOWN THERE.

14:08.208 --> 14:12.708
AND, OF COURSE, WE HAVE
THIS GREEN GELATIN DESSERT

14:12.708 --> 14:14.959
OF A HIGHLY
SUSPICIOUS NATURE.

14:14.959 --> 14:16.375
YOU ARE SUCH A FREAK.

14:16.375 --> 14:17.959
THANKS.

14:17.959 --> 14:21.291
HEY, UM, WHAT ARE YOU
UP TO TONIGHT?

14:21.291 --> 14:22.625
OH, I DON'T KNOW.

14:22.625 --> 14:25.166
PROBABLY JUST THE USUAL.

14:25.166 --> 14:27.667
YOU KNOW, HAVE MY DRIVER
PICK ME UP AROUND 8:00,

14:27.667 --> 14:29.875
GO FOR A MASSAGE
BEFORE MY CATERED DINNER
ABOARD MY YACHT,

14:29.875 --> 14:31.083
THEN MAYBE
JET OVER TO PARIS

14:31.083 --> 14:33.667
TO SEE THE MATISSE
EXHIBIT AT THE LOUVRE.

14:33.667 --> 14:36.417
ACTUALLY, THAT EXHIBIT
WAS MOVED TO THE MET
LAST WEEK.

14:36.417 --> 14:38.542
HOWEVER, I'M PRETTY SURE

14:38.542 --> 14:39.708
I COULD GET US
A RESERVATION--

14:39.708 --> 14:44.667
SAY...8:00?
AT WILLIAM'S.

14:44.667 --> 14:46.208
YOU KNOW. BILLY.

14:46.208 --> 14:50.333
THAT HOT DOG VENDOR GUY
DOWN AT BAILEY'S WHARF.

14:52.041 --> 14:53.875
YOU MEAN LIKE A DATE?

14:53.875 --> 14:56.375
NO. NO, OF COURSE NOT.

14:56.375 --> 15:00.041
IT'S MORE LIKE, UM...
MORE LIKE A DAT.

15:00.041 --> 15:01.458
OH, A DAT.

15:01.458 --> 15:02.667
YEAH, YOU TAKE
THE "E" OFF OF DATE,

15:02.667 --> 15:05.083
YOU HAVE A DAT.

15:05.083 --> 15:06.959
AND WHAT DO PEOPLE
DO ON DATS?

15:06.959 --> 15:10.417
WELL, THERE'S REALLY
NO CODE OF CONDUCT.

15:10.417 --> 15:12.375
ETIQUETTE IS
DEFINITELY OPTIONAL.

15:12.375 --> 15:15.917
SO, JUST KIND OF
MAKE UP OUR OWN RULES.

15:15.917 --> 15:18.041
THE ONLY REQUIREMENT
IS THAT WE HAVE
A GREAT TIME.

15:19.750 --> 15:21.792
OOH, AND DON'T WORRY,

15:21.792 --> 15:22.750
BECAUSE I CHECKED OUT
THE LUNAR CALENDAR.

15:22.750 --> 15:25.250
NO FULL MOON FOR WEEKS.

15:25.250 --> 15:26.917
OK.

15:26.917 --> 15:30.417
YOU KNOW, JACK,
YOU DO HAVE
A CERTAIN CHARM.

15:30.417 --> 15:32.125
BUT I'M GOING
TO IGNORE IT

15:32.125 --> 15:34.166
AND HANG OUT
WITH YOU ANYWAY.

15:34.166 --> 15:34.583
SEE YOU.

15:34.583 --> 15:36.917
SEE YOU.

15:45.125 --> 15:46.750
I HAVE A DATE
WITH JOEY.

15:46.750 --> 15:47.792
THAT'S GREAT.

15:47.792 --> 15:49.250
YEAH.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.291
UH...

15:52.291 --> 15:53.667
PACE, I'M SORRY.
I KNOW DAWSON'S
A FRIEND.

15:53.667 --> 15:56.750
DOESN'T MATTER.
IT'S OK. JUST LEAVE ME
OUT OF THIS, RIGHT?

15:56.750 --> 15:58.166
YEAH.

15:58.166 --> 16:00.417
SO, ANDIE,
UM, I KNOW THAT IT'S
MY NIGHT WITH MOM.

16:00.417 --> 16:01.417
SO IF YOU DON'T
WANT ME TO GO OUT--

16:01.417 --> 16:03.959
NO. I HAVE TO STAY IN
AND STUDY, ANYWAY.

16:03.959 --> 16:04.959
GO.

16:04.959 --> 16:07.041
WE  HAVE TO STAY IN
AND STUDY.

16:07.041 --> 16:08.083
REMEMBER?

16:08.083 --> 16:11.708
RIGHT.
I CAN'T BELIEVE
I'VE FORGOTTEN.

16:11.708 --> 16:13.291
LOOK, JACK,
DON'T WORRY ABOUT MOM.

16:13.291 --> 16:15.792
I MEAN, SHE'S NOT ENTIRELY
YOUR RESPONSIBILITY, OK?

16:15.792 --> 16:18.625
THERE'S 2 OF US.
AND BESIDES, WITH THIS
NEW MEDICATION SHE'S ON,

16:18.625 --> 16:20.917
SHE'S DOING
SO MUCH BETTER.

16:20.917 --> 16:21.500
ANDIE, COME ON.

16:21.500 --> 16:23.083
I MEAN,

16:23.083 --> 16:25.500
MOM PULLED ANOTHER
SYBIL LAST WEEK.

16:25.500 --> 16:27.417
LET'S AT LEAST
BE HONEST
WITH EACH OTHER.

16:27.417 --> 16:29.083
LOOK, JUST GO OUT
WITH JOEY, OK?

16:29.083 --> 16:30.625
EVERYTHING'S
UNDER CONTROL.

16:30.625 --> 16:32.208
I'VE GOT IT
ALL UNDER CONTROL.

16:40.667 --> 16:42.875
[KNOCK ON DOOR]

16:45.667 --> 16:46.667
DAWSON, UM...

16:46.667 --> 16:47.834
WHAT YOU DOING HERE?

16:47.834 --> 16:51.834
UM, THIS IS FOR YOU.

16:51.834 --> 16:52.625
WHAT IS IT?

16:52.625 --> 16:55.083
IT'S HALF
THE PRIZE MONEY.

16:56.000 --> 16:57.625
YOU CAN USE IT
FOR ART CLASSES OR...

16:57.625 --> 17:00.083
WHATEVER.

17:00.083 --> 17:02.166
I CAN'T ACCEPT THIS,
DAWSON. THIS IS
FOR YOUR MOVIE.

17:02.166 --> 17:03.250
JOEY, I WANT YOU
TO HAVE IT.
YOU DESERVE IT.

17:06.208 --> 17:08.500
JOEY, MY INTENTIONS HERE
ARE HONORABLE.

17:08.500 --> 17:11.500
I'M NOT ASKING
FOR ANYTHING IN RETURN.

17:11.500 --> 17:12.290
EXCEPT THAT
YOU BE HAPPY.

17:14.208 --> 17:15.625
I COULD USE
THE MONEY. I MEAN--

17:15.625 --> 17:18.708
THANK YOU.

17:18.708 --> 17:20.708
I BELIEVE IN YOU, JOEY.

17:20.708 --> 17:22.165
I ALWAYS HAVE.

17:24.625 --> 17:26.083
THANKS.

17:26.625 --> 17:28.541
SO, UM...

17:28.541 --> 17:29.875
ARE YOU GOING SOMEWHERE?

17:29.875 --> 17:32.458
OH, NO. I'M JUST
HANGING OUT
WITH A FRIEND.

17:32.458 --> 17:36.083
OK. ALL RIGHT,
UM, SO I'LL, UM...

17:36.083 --> 17:37.917
I GUESS
I'LL SEE YOU AROUND.

17:37.917 --> 17:38.917
OK.

17:38.917 --> 17:40.125
OK.

17:41.542 --> 17:42.542
DAWSON.

17:42.542 --> 17:45.291
YEAH?

17:45.291 --> 17:47.959
DO YOU THINK THINGS
COULD GET BACK TO
NORMAL BETWEEN US,

17:47.959 --> 17:49.291
AND WE COULD JUST
BE FRIENDS AGAIN?

17:52.000 --> 17:53.250
I'D LIKE THAT. YEAH.

17:55.542 --> 17:57.959
OK.

18:02.208 --> 18:04.542
AND, UM...

18:04.542 --> 18:06.667
YOU KNOW,

18:06.667 --> 18:09.500
WHATEVER KIND OF MOVIE
YOU DECIDE TO MAKE,

18:09.500 --> 18:11.208
I...

18:11.208 --> 18:13.417
I KNOW
IT'LL BE GREAT.

18:13.417 --> 18:17.000
I'M THINKING OF DOING
A LOVE STORY.

18:17.000 --> 18:19.583
YOU KNOW,
BOY MEETS GIRL,

18:19.583 --> 18:22.750
BOY GETS GIRL,
BOY LOSES GIRL.

18:22.750 --> 18:25.875
BOY GETS GIRL BACK.

18:28.291 --> 18:29.291
DAWSON.

18:29.291 --> 18:30.375
HEH.

18:30.375 --> 18:33.500
YOU KNOW ME. I'M A SUCKER
FOR HAPPY ENDINGS.

18:33.500 --> 18:34.708
YEAH.

18:39.750 --> 18:42.959
WELL, THANK YOU.

18:42.959 --> 18:44.166
YEAH.

18:52.834 --> 18:54.041
HEY.

18:55.875 --> 18:57.083
HEY.

19:04.291 --> 19:04.625
HEY.

19:04.625 --> 19:06.708
HEY.

19:06.708 --> 19:08.208
HEY.

19:08.208 --> 19:09.792
EVERYTHING OK?

19:09.792 --> 19:12.542
YEAH. YEAH, FINE.
JUST, UH, YOU KNOW,

19:12.542 --> 19:13.542
SAYING HI.

19:14.875 --> 19:16.291
MAYBE WE SHOULD
GO INSIDE.

19:16.291 --> 19:17.291
SURE.

19:17.291 --> 19:18.291
GO AHEAD.

19:18.291 --> 19:19.250
THANKS.

19:33.917 --> 19:35.166
ALL RIGHT.

19:35.166 --> 19:36.875
THE LAST BOX.

19:36.875 --> 19:37.667
SO,

19:37.667 --> 19:39.166
I GUESS
I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

19:39.166 --> 19:42.834
WHOA. DAWSON,
WHAT'S THE RUSH?

19:42.834 --> 19:43.959
STICK AROUND.

19:43.959 --> 19:45.125
HANG OUT.

19:45.125 --> 19:48.834
WORKING THAT
FRIEND ANGLE?

19:48.834 --> 19:50.708
I WAS TRYING.

19:50.708 --> 19:53.041
TALK TO ME.

19:55.291 --> 19:56.083
LOOK, DAWSON, WE'VE
ALWAYS BEEN ABLE

19:56.083 --> 19:58.542
TO TALK FREELY
AND OPENLY.

19:58.542 --> 19:59.083
I DON'T WANT THAT
TO CHANGE.

19:59.083 --> 20:01.834
OK. LET'S TALK.

20:01.834 --> 20:03.834
OK, GOOD. SO, UM...

20:03.834 --> 20:06.000
HOW'S JOEY?

20:06.000 --> 20:07.500
JOEY DUMPED ME

20:07.500 --> 20:09.000
AND IS FALLING
FOR ANOTHER GUY.

20:09.000 --> 20:10.250
NEXT.

20:13.375 --> 20:14.875
AND, UH, JEN?

20:14.875 --> 20:17.542
PROBABLY DRUNK AND STUCK
TO A SIDEWALK SOMEWHERE.

20:17.542 --> 20:18.625
DAWSON--

20:18.625 --> 20:20.375
DAD, THIS ISN'T
GOING TO WORK, OK?

20:20.375 --> 20:22.291
I'M SO--I'M
GOING TO GET GOING.

20:22.291 --> 20:23.291
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIKE
MY DECISIONS, DAWSON.

20:23.291 --> 20:25.875
I JUST ASK THAT
YOU RESPECT THEM.

20:25.875 --> 20:28.208
YOU KNOW WHAT?
ALL I EVER DO

20:28.208 --> 20:29.959
IS RESPECT
OTHER PEOPLE'S
WISHES, OK?

20:29.959 --> 20:32.625
I'M SICK OF IT.
IT MAKES EVERYBODY ELSE
FEEL BETTER.

20:32.625 --> 20:34.041
IT MAKES ME FEEL
LIKE HELL.

20:34.041 --> 20:35.291
WELL, MAYBE
THAT'S BECAUSE

20:35.291 --> 20:36.917
YOU'RE ONLY CONSIDERING
THE OUTCOMES

20:36.917 --> 20:38.542
AND NOT THE INTENTIONS.

20:40.000 --> 20:40.959
