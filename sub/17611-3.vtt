Bubbles: Ricky, look, I'm sorry

00:36.244 --> 00:39.206
but there's no fucking time

00:39.247 --> 00:40.875
to go to Christiania.

00:40.916 --> 00:43.002
I know we're in Copenhagen but it's too fucking bad.

00:43.042 --> 00:45.212
We've got to focus and make some money.

00:45.253 --> 00:47.088
You know, I can almost hear what you're saying.

00:47.130 --> 00:48.507
I can almost do that.

00:48.549 --> 00:50.217
But everything I've fucking read on the webernet

00:50.258 --> 00:51.844
says this place is almost like Amsterdam.

00:51.886 --> 00:53.804
So we're fucking making time and we're going!

00:53.846 --> 00:55.597
We... No, we're not! It's not going

00:53.846 --> 00:55.597

We're not! Ah, fuck off!

Good morning, piss-stains.

00:59.852 --> 01:02.229
How was your breakfast? Mine was amazing.

01:02.270 --> 01:04.648
Ha ha, real funny. Asshole.

01:04.690 --> 01:06.901
Why don't you fuck your bag with your

01:04.690 --> 01:06.901
tits and ass?

01:06.942 --> 01:08.068
How about that?

01:08.109 --> 01:10.278
Ricky, what the fuck does that even mean?

01:10.320 --> 01:12.197
How was that joint you took off me last night?

01:12.239 --> 01:14.449
'Cause I know you smoked every fucking

01:12.239 --> 01:14.449
bit of it, didn't you?

01:14.491 --> 01:16.076
Yeah, I did. Cocksucker.

01:16.117 --> 01:18.245
Some of the best fucking weed I ever

01:16.117 --> 01:18.245
smoked in my life.

01:18.286 --> 01:20.247
It took me right off my head.

01:20.288 --> 01:22.666
Here's your task for today.

01:38.724 --> 01:40.684
Yeah, like we're going to fucking do that.

01:40.726 --> 01:42.937
I don't think so. There's a little

01:49.526 --> 01:51.486
Pretty easy money right there if

01:49.526 --> 01:51.486
you're motivated.

01:51.528 --> 01:53.238
That's...fucked!

01:53.280 --> 01:55.699
Oh, Jesus, Ricky, look. This solves

01:53.280 --> 01:55.699
the problem here.

"Number 2: do not go into Christiania,

01:55.741 --> 01:58.869

02:03.916 --> 02:06.334
We're not going. We just won't go

02:03.916 --> 02:06.334
anywhere near it.

02:06.376 --> 02:07.753
That'll solve that.

02:07.795 --> 02:09.337
Wrong.

02:09.379 --> 02:11.131
Strap that fucker on.

02:11.172 --> 02:12.716
Go around, get me some shots.

02:12.758 --> 02:14.551
I'll meet you at the gates of that fucker.

02:14.593 --> 02:17.096

02:17.137 --> 02:19.890
What else is there?

02:19.932 --> 02:22.726

02:39.534 --> 02:42.329

02:42.370 --> 02:44.123
When you say two blows to the nuts,

02:44.164 --> 02:45.916
do you mean hit him twice in the nuts

02:45.958 --> 02:47.542
or do something else I'd rather not do?

02:47.584 --> 02:49.336
We're not going to... blow on his nuts twice?

02:49.377 --> 02:51.755
Hit him, kick him, punch him. Fuck,

02:49.377 --> 02:51.755
it doesn't matter.

02:51.797 --> 02:54.382

03:06.812 --> 03:08.939
Do you even know who Brian Nielsen is, man?

03:08.981 --> 03:11.274
He fought Tyson and Holyfield,

03:08.981 --> 03:11.274
for fuck's sakes!

03:11.316 --> 03:13.401
But you don't got to fight him.

03:13.443 --> 03:16.571
We're not asking you to jack him off or fucking tongue his balls

03:13.443 --> 03:16.571
or massage him.

03:16.613 --> 03:18.365
You've just got to fucking hit him

03:16.613 --> 03:18.365
in the nuts twice.

03:18.406 --> 03:20.784
I haven't eaten yet, though, boys. Fuck!

03:20.826 --> 03:22.619
You haven't done anything else either.

03:22.661 --> 03:25.789
Like, maybe it's your turn to do something.

03:25.831 --> 03:27.541
I've done all kinds of shit.

03:27.582 --> 03:29.334

03:27.582 --> 03:29.334
the fucking asshole

03:29.376 --> 03:31.837

You got it?

03:33.130 --> 03:34.548

03:44.850 --> 03:46.560
another strip club!

03:46.601 --> 03:47.978

03:48.020 --> 03:50.189
We're in the fucking grease district.

03:50.271 --> 03:52.191
And why are we even doing this greasy stuff?

03:52.232 --> 03:54.359
I mean, if you're getting in the ring with the big guy,

03:54.401 --> 03:56.361
can't we just go do that and make the big money?

03:56.403 --> 03:57.946
Bubs, I haven't eaten yet!

03:57.988 --> 03:59.406
I need some food for some energy, man.

03:59.447 --> 04:01.200
This guy's going to fucking kill me.

04:01.241 --> 04:02.826
And I've got to find some fucking weed

04:01.241 --> 04:02.826
and hash.

04:02.868 --> 04:04.661
It's almost like Amsterdam here, man.

04:07.873 --> 04:09.332
I almost got fucking high in Germany.

04:09.374 --> 04:10.625
That was just a goddamn tease.

04:10.667 --> 04:12.377
Where the fuck are we going to

04:10.667 --> 04:12.377
find a strap-on?

04:12.419 --> 04:14.462
That's the question. There's sex shops

04:12.419 --> 04:14.462
everywhere.

04:14.504 --> 04:15.839
Sex shop, right here.

04:19.467 --> 04:21.428
All right, cool. There's only one person

04:19.467 --> 04:21.428
working in there.

04:21.469 --> 04:23.430
This is the plan. We're all going to go in.

04:23.471 --> 04:25.099
Him and I are going to cause a distraction.

04:25.140 --> 04:26.225
You take it. You leave.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.227
We'll come out after you.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.227
Why me?

04:28.268 --> 04:31.479
What do you mean why you? I'm getting

04:28.268 --> 04:31.479
into a fucking ring

04:31.521 --> 04:33.232
with a heavyweight champion!

04:31.521 --> 04:33.232
Fine.

04:33.273 --> 04:35.234
I'll steal the fucking thing but

04:33.273 --> 04:35.234
I'm not wearing it.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.069
One of you two guys is wearing it.

04:35.275 --> 04:37.069
Jesus!

04:37.111 --> 04:38.904
Well, I guarantee you, I'm not wearing

04:37.111 --> 04:38.904
the fucking thing.

04:38.946 --> 04:41.364
I was in a goddamn marathon, so I did

04:38.946 --> 04:41.364
my part.

04:41.406 --> 04:43.366
I'll wear the fucking thing.

04:43.408 --> 04:46.245
You'll wear a strap-on around Copenhagen?

04:43.408 --> 04:46.245
I don't give a fuck anymore.

04:46.286 --> 04:48.455
I need a drink. I need food. Come on!

04:46.286 --> 04:48.455
Deal! Deal!

04:48.496 --> 04:49.915

05:00.926 --> 05:02.469
Here we go.

05:02.510 --> 05:03.971
Find one with straps.

05:04.012 --> 05:06.056
Give me a thumbs up when you're ready.

05:06.098 --> 05:08.267
(Whispering) It's got to be at least a

05:06.098 --> 05:08.267
10-incher. Don't forget.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.310
Okay. Miss, can we have some

05:08.308 --> 05:10.310
help down here please?

05:10.351 --> 05:12.062
Woman: Yes.

05:12.104 --> 05:13.897
Look at these fucking things, man.

05:13.939 --> 05:16.316
Bubbles: Jesus. I didn't

05:13.939 --> 05:16.316
know these existed.

05:16.357 --> 05:17.484
(Speaking in Danish)

05:17.525 --> 05:18.902
My friend has a couple of questions

05:18.944 --> 05:20.528
about these things here. No, I... no! I d...!

05:20.570 --> 05:22.489
Uh... yeah... no... I was just...

05:22.530 --> 05:24.532
wondering, you know... these type of things...

05:24.574 --> 05:26.076
What's that all about there?

05:26.118 --> 05:30.497
Woman: (Speaking in Danish)

05:30.538 --> 05:32.916
Oh... yeah...!

05:32.958 --> 05:34.501
Oh yeah! Look at that!

05:34.542 --> 05:36.503
Yeah, oh... you fuck...

05:36.544 --> 05:38.005
(In Danish)

05:38.046 --> 05:39.714
Oh, yes, yeah...

05:39.756 --> 05:41.508
Oh, it opens right up too, yeah.

05:41.549 --> 05:43.135
(In Danish)

05:43.177 --> 05:44.511
What?

05:44.552 --> 05:47.181
Oh, yeah, look at that! It's just like a turkey!

05:47.222 --> 05:49.348
Just like a turkey!

05:49.390 --> 05:51.726
Yeah... oh, doo-dee-doo!

05:51.768 --> 05:53.520
Are you going to take this or... what?

05:53.561 --> 05:55.105
Err, no, I was looking...

05:55.147 --> 05:56.940
No, that's not exactly what I was looking for.

05:56.982 --> 05:58.525
All right. It's not what he's looking for.

05:58.566 --> 06:00.194
Thank you, thank you.

06:00.235 --> 06:01.444
Thank you!

06:01.486 --> 06:03.113
(In Danish)

06:03.155 --> 06:05.115
(Whispering) She made me put

06:03.155 --> 06:05.115
my finger in it!

06:05.157 --> 06:06.950
I never felt so awkward in my life.

06:06.992 --> 06:08.576
I thought we were just going to go in

06:08.618 --> 06:10.745
and, you know, create a basic distraction

06:10.787 --> 06:12.747
and the next thing you know,

06:12.789 --> 06:15.209
I'm fingering a rubber torso!

06:15.250 --> 06:16.751
Greasy!

06:16.793 --> 06:18.003
Ricky: Money time!

06:18.045 --> 06:19.546
Is it a 10-incher? Oh, yeah.

06:19.587 --> 06:20.964
Here, Julian. Put it on, bud.

06:21.006 --> 06:22.465
Wait now, wait now. Just a second.

06:22.507 --> 06:24.343
Here. No.

06:24.383 --> 06:26.345
I think those Swearnet fucks are trying to

06:24.383 --> 06:26.345
fuck us over again, man.

06:26.385 --> 06:27.971
What are you talking about?

06:26.385 --> 06:27.971
Technicalities.

06:28.013 --> 06:29.973
Check this out: "Acquire a strap-on dildo

06:30.015 --> 06:32.226
and wear it around the city for an hour. 25 bucks."

06:32.267 --> 06:33.476
Yeah, there you go.

06:33.518 --> 06:35.145
No, think about it, man.

06:35.187 --> 06:37.356
"Acquire a strap-on and wear it."

06:37.438 --> 06:39.607
That means that they want the person that

06:37.438 --> 06:39.607
stole the fucking thing

06:39.649 --> 06:40.817
to wear the fucking thing.

06:40.859 --> 06:42.610
That could mean... They could get us

06:40.859 --> 06:42.610
on that!

06:42.652 --> 06:44.238
No, it doesn't! It's totally

06:42.652 --> 06:44.238
what it means.

06:44.279 --> 06:45.655
He'll get us on that. Fine. I'll put it back

06:45.697 --> 06:47.615
and you can fucking steal it, then.

06:47.657 --> 06:49.034
We're not going to risk doing that

06:47.657 --> 06:49.034
again, you dumbass!

06:49.076 --> 06:50.535
I'm not wearing a 10-inch cock

06:50.577 --> 06:51.703
around the fucking city.

06:51.745 --> 06:52.954
Do you want to get in the fucking ring

06:52.996 --> 06:54.455
with a heavyweight champion?

06:54.497 --> 06:55.999
Do you want to do that? Huh? Huh?

06:56.041 --> 06:58.710
The cock's a better idea, Ricky.

06:58.752 --> 07:01.420
This is fucked... Strap on that cock

06:58.752 --> 07:01.420
and suck it up.

07:01.462 --> 07:02.797
Do something.

07:02.839 --> 07:04.423
How the fuck does this thing work?

07:05.633 --> 07:07.010
Bubs, give him a hand.

07:07.052 --> 07:09.012
I don't how to work it. Here, Ricky, just...

07:09.054 --> 07:12.057
put it on like a belt probably, do you?

07:12.099 --> 07:13.058
I don't know.

07:13.100 --> 07:14.309
Here, hold it for a second.

07:14.351 --> 07:15.727
No, here, I'll just work the straps.

07:15.769 --> 07:18.021
(People wooing) Let me get the straps.

07:18.063 --> 07:20.399
Just hold the shaft for a second and let

07:18.063 --> 07:20.399
me fucking get this!

07:20.440 --> 07:22.442
(Mixed wooing and chuckling) Oh, my fuck!

07:22.483 --> 07:24.027
Here, hurry up.

07:24.069 --> 07:26.029
Bubs, it's not real, man. Chill out.

07:24.069 --> 07:26.029
I know, but...

07:26.071 --> 07:27.655
(Mixed cheering and cat-calling)

07:27.697 --> 07:29.657
Yup, nothing to see here. Just keep moving.

07:29.699 --> 07:31.076
(Mixed calls)

07:31.118 --> 07:32.660
You got it?

07:32.702 --> 07:34.454
It's all greasy.

07:34.495 --> 07:35.705
Fucking Jesus!

07:35.747 --> 07:36.706
Ricky, don't hit me with it.

07:36.748 --> 07:38.833
Man: What the fuck, man!

07:38.875 --> 07:41.420
It's actually not that noticeable.

07:41.461 --> 07:43.588
Not that noticeable? Man:

07:41.461 --> 07:43.588
Yeah yeah, it's good!

07:43.630 --> 07:46.216
I wish I had a fucking meat-log this

07:43.630 --> 07:46.216
big, but anyway...

07:46.258 --> 07:48.302
Let's just get this going, boys.

07:46.258 --> 07:48.302
Come on.

07:48.343 --> 07:49.510
This is so fucked.

07:50.678 --> 07:52.639
(Whispering) This is fucked.

07:52.680 --> 07:54.057
For fuck's sakes!

07:54.099 --> 07:56.684
Cat-caller: Whoo! I like your dick...!

07:56.726 --> 07:57.852
Man: (Indistinct)

07:57.894 --> 08:00.063
How's it going? Good times.

08:03.275 --> 08:05.652
(Mixed laughs) Man:

08:03.275 --> 08:05.652
Welcome to Denmark!

08:05.693 --> 08:06.903
Sorry.

08:06.945 --> 08:08.405
(Car horn honking)

08:08.447 --> 08:09.614
Man: How you doing!

08:10.698 --> 08:12.075
(Whistle)

08:12.117 --> 08:14.244
Boys, where the fuck are these statues?

08:14.286 --> 08:16.246
They're still a little ways, Ricky.

08:16.288 --> 08:18.290
Better be some good fucking hash for

08:16.288 --> 08:18.290
going through this.

08:18.332 --> 08:19.707
(Bicycle bell chiming)

08:19.749 --> 08:21.793
(In Danish) It's a cock, okay?

08:19.749 --> 08:21.793
No big deal.

08:21.835 --> 08:22.794
Fuck off.

08:22.836 --> 08:24.421
It's going pretty good.

08:24.463 --> 08:25.797
Woman: (Cat-calling in Danish)

08:24.463 --> 08:25.797
Thank you!

08:25.839 --> 08:27.674
Man: Y tu mama tambien!

08:27.715 --> 08:29.259
Maybe you should wear it for a little bit.

08:29.301 --> 08:31.886
No, Ricky. I... Man:

08:29.301 --> 08:31.886
Eh, eh, eh!

08:31.928 --> 08:33.305
Don't fuck this over.

08:33.347 --> 08:34.806
(Mixed wooing) For fuck's sakes!

08:34.848 --> 08:35.807
Just keep that cock on.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.018
(More people cat-calling)

08:38.059 --> 08:41.729
Could you fucking at least walk in front of me and block it a

08:38.059 --> 08:41.729
little bit?

08:41.771 --> 08:43.690
People are fucking losing it, here.

08:44.941 --> 08:46.485
Man: Hello, mister!

08:46.526 --> 08:48.278
Oh, look, boys. There's what

08:46.526 --> 08:48.278
I'd like to...

08:48.320 --> 08:50.280
Ricky! (Laughing)

08:48.320 --> 08:50.280
Jesus, Bubs!

08:50.322 --> 08:52.740
Well, don't stop if you're in front

08:50.322 --> 08:52.740
of me like that!

08:52.782 --> 08:54.701
Jesus, you almost got me!

08:54.742 --> 08:55.952
I say we go this way.

08:55.994 --> 08:57.912
Ricky, stop stabbing me with it!

08:59.747 --> 09:01.708
Wait, now, you get in front of me, man.

09:01.749 --> 09:02.959
What's that?

09:03.001 --> 09:04.211
I'm not... Get...

09:04.252 --> 09:05.628
Turn around. Get... Keep going.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.047
You go in the front. It's too dangerous.

09:07.088 --> 09:08.715
Are you sure? It's too

09:07.088 --> 09:08.715
dangerous...

09:08.756 --> 09:10.175
Ricky, stop fucking around!

09:10.217 --> 09:11.343
Ricky.

09:11.385 --> 09:13.928
Walk! Walk! Get that away from me.

09:13.970 --> 09:15.347
Walking around the city with this big,

09:15.389 --> 09:17.349
giant meat fucking bag hanging off is one thing

09:17.391 --> 09:19.600
but banging statues within broad daylight,

09:19.642 --> 09:20.935
not being drunk or stoned,

09:20.977 --> 09:23.104
that takes it to a whole another level.

09:23.146 --> 09:25.773
Just so we're clear, boys, the guys from Swearnet

09:23.146 --> 09:25.773
are fucked in the head!

09:25.815 --> 09:27.025
This is ridiculous!

09:27.067 --> 09:28.776
The first statue's right there, buddy.

09:28.818 --> 09:29.777
Let's get this over with.

09:29.819 --> 09:31.238
For fuck's sakes!

09:32.572 --> 09:34.157
Does it say where I'm supposed to bang it?

09:34.199 --> 09:35.742
You've just got to bang it, man.

09:35.783 --> 09:37.160
Mouth, behind, wherever.

09:37.202 --> 09:38.537
Bubbles: There's three

09:37.202 --> 09:38.537
of them, though.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.539
Should I bang  the horse or the dude?

09:40.580 --> 09:42.582
Doesn't matter, you've just got to bang the statue.

09:42.623 --> 09:43.833
Well, just wait. You know what?

09:43.875 --> 09:45.335
Just so they don't get us on

09:43.875 --> 09:45.335
a technicality,

09:45.377 --> 09:46.753
why don't you do all three, I mean,

09:46.794 --> 09:48.338
look, his mouth's open.

09:48.380 --> 09:49.964
Jam it in there. Get up there, man.

09:50.006 --> 09:51.966
Then slink up behind the fella.

09:55.220 --> 09:57.013
Julian: All right, get him

09:55.220 --> 09:57.013
right in the mouth.

09:57.055 --> 09:58.765
Stick it right in there.

09:58.806 --> 10:00.225
All right. Get the picture,

09:58.806 --> 10:00.225
for fuck's sakes!

10:00.267 --> 10:01.768
We've got the... Move out the way, Bubs.

10:01.809 --> 10:03.019
Sorry.

10:03.061 --> 10:04.521
We got that one. Next one.

10:04.563 --> 10:05.730
Up behind this guy.

10:07.399 --> 10:08.858
Bubbles: Can you get up there, Ricky?

10:08.900 --> 10:10.444
Be careful.

10:10.485 --> 10:12.237
Be careful. Don't break your fucking

10:10.485 --> 10:12.237
ankle or something.

10:12.279 --> 10:14.072
Julian: All right, put it

10:12.279 --> 10:14.072
right in the back there.

10:15.031 --> 10:16.241
Ricky: You see it?

10:16.283 --> 10:18.618
Yeah. Got it, got it. All right.

10:18.659 --> 10:20.454
Good going, man.

10:20.495 --> 10:21.996
This is fucked, boys.

10:22.038 --> 10:23.248
Bubbles: Nice work, Ricky.

10:23.290 --> 10:25.708
The shit you do for fucking money!

10:25.750 --> 10:28.211
Here, this way.

10:28.253 --> 10:30.213
Julian: Don't fucking

10:28.253 --> 10:30.213
kill yourself.

10:31.298 --> 10:32.507
Goddammit!

10:32.549 --> 10:33.716
Don't fall, Ricky.

10:35.051 --> 10:36.803
Push on his ass so he doesn't fall.

10:36.844 --> 10:38.054
Ricky: Okay.

10:38.096 --> 10:40.014
Can you get up to the hole?

10:40.056 --> 10:42.476
Julian: Get it in the hole, man.

10:42.517 --> 10:44.811
A bit more. Okay...

10:44.852 --> 10:46.480
Got it!

10:46.521 --> 10:47.481
Right on, man!

10:47.522 --> 10:49.483
Nice work, Ricky. 10 bucks, boys!

10:49.524 --> 10:51.234
That's 10! Where's the next one?

10:51.276 --> 10:53.236
Let's get a couple more of these fucking things.

10:53.278 --> 10:55.196
Fuck's sakes! I think we've

10:53.278 --> 10:55.196
got to go...

10:56.531 --> 10:57.698
this way.

10:58.825 --> 11:00.368
Yeah, this way. Right up here.

11:00.410 --> 11:02.621
I've never done anything this fucked in my life

11:02.662 --> 11:04.205
to make money, but I did it.

11:04.247 --> 11:06.040
My did it, and me's going to decide what the fuck

11:06.082 --> 11:07.459
to do with the money!

11:07.501 --> 11:09.085
Ricky: All right, let's fucking go.

11:09.127 --> 11:10.962
You owe me some money. I just wore this

11:09.127 --> 11:10.962
for an hour.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.256
Tom: Oh, I know you did.

11:11.004 --> 11:13.256
Let me see it.

11:14.882 --> 11:17.260
Yup. Regulation size. That's 25.

11:17.302 --> 11:19.846
What else you got? Show him, Julian.

11:19.887 --> 11:22.056
We're real fucking proud of these. Thanks, man.

11:23.891 --> 11:25.644
Nice statue fucking.

11:25.684 --> 11:28.771
That's three. That's 55 I owe you.

11:28.813 --> 11:29.939
There you go.

11:29.981 --> 11:31.858
There's an extra 100 in there for you

11:31.899 --> 11:33.652
if you can stay out of there.

11:33.692 --> 11:35.069
There's a lot of weed and hash in there.

11:35.111 --> 11:36.737
It's going to be hard.

11:36.779 --> 11:38.156
We can stay out of there.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.907
Stay out of there, Ricky. Let's just walk away.

11:39.949 --> 11:42.202
Just give me the money. Let's go.

11:39.949 --> 11:42.202
Just smell it, boys.

11:42.243 --> 11:44.663
I can smell it. It smells like KFC and

11:42.243 --> 11:44.663
McDonald's, but it's hash.

11:44.703 --> 11:46.914
I know, Ricky. I can smell it

11:44.703 --> 11:46.914
but you know what?

11:46.956 --> 11:48.291
There's lots other places

11:48.333 --> 11:50.084
that we can get weed and hash,

11:48.333 --> 11:50.084
so let's just...

11:50.126 --> 11:51.710
Julian: Let's go. Boys,

11:50.126 --> 11:51.710
let's just fucking go.

11:51.752 --> 11:53.547
You're right, boys. Bubbles:

11:51.752 --> 11:53.547
Let's go.

11:53.588 --> 11:56.090
Are you fucking kidding me? Ricky!

11:56.132 --> 11:58.510
Ricky! Fuck's sakes!

12:00.970 --> 12:02.681
He could be fucking anywhere, Julian.

12:02.721 --> 12:04.474
We've just got to find where there's

12:02.721 --> 12:04.474
some weed, man.

12:04.516 --> 12:06.476
Where there's some weed, there's going to be Ricky.

12:06.518 --> 12:08.102
I know but there's weed... look, there's weed

12:08.144 --> 12:09.937
growing out in the open.

12:09.979 --> 12:11.939
Like, we're going to be lucky to get

12:09.979 --> 12:11.939
Ricky out of here.

12:11.981 --> 12:14.484
He's probably building a fucking house by now.

12:14.526 --> 12:17.945
Or he's moved into a car or something.

12:14.526 --> 12:17.945
You watch.

12:17.987 --> 12:19.322
Check out the weed plants, man.

12:19.364 --> 12:20.948
I know. Like, look. That's just...

12:22.158 --> 12:23.910
This is going to be paradise to Ricky.

12:23.951 --> 12:25.744
We're never going to get him out of here.

12:25.786 --> 12:27.914
All right. I say we go this way.

12:27.955 --> 12:29.916
Ricky: Weed, hash, has anybody got any?

12:29.957 --> 12:31.167
Just looking for some smoke.

12:31.209 --> 12:32.919
I've got money. Come on, please,

12:32.960 --> 12:34.921
would someone give me some weed or hash here?

12:34.962 --> 12:36.923
I heard this place has got all kinds of it.

12:38.383 --> 12:41.511
(Sighing) Please get me

12:38.383 --> 12:41.511
some fucking hash.

12:41.553 --> 12:43.971
This is going to be fucking impossible, man.

12:44.013 --> 12:46.140
I know. This place is fucking gigantic.

12:46.182 --> 12:47.975
Jesus Christ, he better not have spent

12:48.017 --> 12:49.352
all the fucking money, man!

12:49.394 --> 12:51.938
Oh, do you think he didn't?

12:49.394 --> 12:51.938
(Sighing)

12:51.979 --> 12:54.023
Excuse me, have you seen a guy...

12:54.065 --> 12:55.983
He sort of has hair like Elvis

12:56.025 --> 12:57.776
and, like, a fiery Japanese shirt.

12:57.818 --> 13:01.155
Elvis? (In Danish)

13:01.197 --> 13:03.991
Down here there's an Elvis guy, down here.

13:04.033 --> 13:05.993
That's got to be him.

13:06.035 --> 13:07.579
Holy fuck, look at this!

13:07.621 --> 13:10.749
A big load of awesome stuff here

13:07.621 --> 13:10.749
getting thrown out!

13:12.208 --> 13:14.168
Julian, look at this!

13:14.210 --> 13:16.379
Bubs, I don't give a fuck about that

13:14.210 --> 13:16.379
right now.

13:16.421 --> 13:18.172
Decent! We've got to go.

13:18.214 --> 13:19.591
We've got to go. Just wait.

13:19.633 --> 13:21.426
I just want to go through it quickly.

13:21.468 --> 13:23.052
You're not going to go through a dumpster

13:21.468 --> 13:23.052
full of shit!

13:23.094 --> 13:24.679
Let's go. Come on! Why not?

13:24.721 --> 13:26.097
What are you going to do with it

13:24.721 --> 13:26.097
when you find it?

13:26.139 --> 13:27.515
I'll weld something together.

13:27.557 --> 13:28.933
There's a blacksmith right in there.

13:28.975 --> 13:30.977
(Sighing) Bubs, we don't have time.

13:31.018 --> 13:32.853
I need food! Okay?

13:32.895 --> 13:34.606
Do you understand that? I do.

13:34.648 --> 13:37.191
Well, I do too. It's been days!

13:34.648 --> 13:37.191
This is bad enough.

13:37.233 --> 13:39.986
Like, I haven't... Look at this!

13:40.027 --> 13:42.155
This is why there's no shopping carts around,

13:40.027 --> 13:42.155
right here.

13:42.196 --> 13:44.407
Okay, great. Brilliant.

13:42.196 --> 13:44.407
They've got them built on the bikes.

13:44.449 --> 13:46.242
You're great, you've figured it

13:44.449 --> 13:46.242
out, man, let's go.

13:46.284 --> 13:47.910
It's basically like a ice-cream bike

13:47.952 --> 13:50.037
but with the top lopped off.

13:50.079 --> 13:52.624
Oh, decent! Check this out!

13:54.459 --> 13:57.253
Bubs, are you fucking kidding me? Let's go!

13:57.295 --> 13:59.005
Bubs! Let's just...

13:59.046 --> 14:02.049
I just want to have a look at how

13:59.046 --> 14:02.049
it's put together.

14:02.091 --> 14:03.593
We waste a couple of minutes here,

14:03.635 --> 14:05.679
he could be moving on to another spot.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.263
Let's go.

14:07.305 --> 14:09.015
That's a fucking...

14:09.056 --> 14:10.684
wicked buggy!

14:10.725 --> 14:12.644
Ricky!

14:12.686 --> 14:14.145
Fuck's sakes!

14:16.897 --> 14:19.025
Weed! Hash! Herbal! Who's selling?

14:19.066 --> 14:20.860
Come on, I can smell it.

14:20.901 --> 14:22.612
You know where I can get some weed or hash?

14:22.654 --> 14:26.032
Oh, yeah. You're going the wrong

14:22.654 --> 14:26.032
direction. This way.

14:26.073 --> 14:28.075
Oh, yeah? Man:

14:26.073 --> 14:28.075
(Indistinct)

14:28.117 --> 14:29.452
Awesome!

14:29.494 --> 14:32.038
Oh, that looks like J-Roc's bus.

14:32.079 --> 14:34.290
J-Roc's fuck-wagon.

14:34.332 --> 14:35.500
Ricky!

14:37.502 --> 14:39.086
Look, there's an old circus tent.

14:39.128 --> 14:41.464
Maybe he crawled under there, baked.

14:41.506 --> 14:43.466
He didn't crawl under there, Bubs.

14:43.508 --> 14:45.635
Well, think about it. If you were...

14:45.677 --> 14:48.262
Ricky super-baked, where would you go?

14:45.677 --> 14:48.262
You know.

14:48.304 --> 14:51.098
I don't fucking know where I'd go, man.

14:51.140 --> 14:52.475
Did you guys see a guy who looks like Elvis

14:52.517 --> 14:55.061
walking around, red flaming shirt?

14:55.102 --> 14:57.063
He's looking for weed. No?

14:59.273 --> 15:01.108
I'm not crawling in any fucking bushes.

15:01.150 --> 15:02.485
You guys see a guy looks like,

15:02.527 --> 15:05.279
sort of looks like Elvis, red-flamed shirt on?

15:05.321 --> 15:07.490
Probably baked out of his goddamn mind.

15:07.532 --> 15:09.701
I think I would remember if I saw him.

15:09.743 --> 15:11.077
Julian: Yeah, no?

15:11.118 --> 15:12.662
If you see him, tell him we're looking for him.

15:12.704 --> 15:15.081
Where do you buy the weed around here?

15:12.704 --> 15:15.081
Over that way?

15:15.122 --> 15:17.166
Man: Right that way.

15:17.208 --> 15:18.543
That way?

15:18.585 --> 15:20.211
Man 2: There's a lot

15:18.585 --> 15:20.211
of weed also.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.671
Man: He's probably there.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.671
Yeah?

15:21.713 --> 15:23.089
Bubbles: Things are going to shit here.

15:23.130 --> 15:25.132
I mean, we're in this awesome place,

15:25.174 --> 15:27.134
Christiania, where there's...

15:27.176 --> 15:29.888
ladies doing hula-hoops and... no rules.

15:29.929 --> 15:32.515
We should be having a great time but we can't find Ricky,

15:32.557 --> 15:34.893
we've got no food, no dope.

15:34.934 --> 15:37.061
Poor Julian hasn't eaten in days

15:37.103 --> 15:40.774
and he's got to get in the ring with

15:37.103 --> 15:40.774
that big bastard.

15:40.815 --> 15:42.525
I feel bad for him.

15:42.567 --> 15:45.069
Julian, we've been over every square inch

15:42.567 --> 15:45.069
of this fucking place.

15:45.111 --> 15:47.530
What are we going to do? Well, we've got

15:45.111 --> 15:47.530
to keep looking.

15:47.572 --> 15:49.115
I know, but I'm starting to get worried.

15:49.156 --> 15:50.700
What if we don't ever find him?

15:50.742 --> 15:52.660
Then what? We'll find him.

15:52.702 --> 15:54.954
We've got to find him! We're going to...

15:52.702 --> 15:54.954
just leave him here?

15:54.995 --> 15:56.539
No. Just (indistinct).

15:54.995 --> 15:56.539
Ricky!

15:56.581 --> 15:59.166
Ricky: Boys!

15:56.581 --> 15:59.166
There he is!

15:59.208 --> 16:00.334
Ricky: Let's get

15:59.208 --> 16:00.334
fucked up!

16:00.376 --> 16:02.044
Bubbles: He's right there

16:00.376 --> 16:02.044
on the thing.

16:02.086 --> 16:04.130
Julian: We've been looking all over the fucking

16:02.086 --> 16:04.130
place for you,

16:04.171 --> 16:05.339
you asshole! Hey, boys!

16:05.381 --> 16:07.174
Give me the rest of the money.

16:07.216 --> 16:09.176
Just in time for Round 2! Give me the rest

16:07.216 --> 16:09.176
of the money!

16:09.218 --> 16:10.678
It's right here.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.263
You spent it all?

16:12.305 --> 16:14.140
I just handed the money and said I needed

16:12.305 --> 16:14.140
some hash, some weed

16:14.181 --> 16:16.016
and some fucking oil... For fuck's

16:14.181 --> 16:16.016
sakes, Ricky!

16:16.058 --> 16:17.184
...few mushrooms and some food.

16:17.226 --> 16:18.853
I got you a bottle of rum!

16:18.895 --> 16:20.104
Be happy, man.

16:20.146 --> 16:21.147
Fuck, Rick! There we go.

16:21.188 --> 16:22.565
I need food, man!

16:22.607 --> 16:23.983
Right here. Chocolate...

16:24.024 --> 16:26.068
No, I was talking about pasta or something, man.

16:26.110 --> 16:27.236
Chocolate. Not fucking... brownies!

16:27.278 --> 16:28.655
It'll give you lots of energy.

16:28.696 --> 16:30.657
Give you lots of energy for the big fight.

16:30.698 --> 16:33.326
Ricky, chocolate doesn't give you energy.

16:33.367 --> 16:35.829
It's not the chocolate that's going to give

16:33.367 --> 16:35.829
him the energy, bud.

16:35.870 --> 16:37.079
(Chuckling)

16:37.121 --> 16:38.080
What?

16:38.122 --> 16:39.540
What? Are those, hash cookies?

16:39.582 --> 16:41.167
(With a mouth full) What? What are these?

16:41.208 --> 16:43.169
Hash, weed and... this has mushrooms in it.

16:43.210 --> 16:45.839
What? Ricky!

16:45.880 --> 16:47.173
Fucking idiot!

16:47.214 --> 16:49.175
Ricky: What, man? Here.

16:47.214 --> 16:49.175
(Spitting)

16:49.216 --> 16:51.051
You want some of this, Bubs?

16:51.093 --> 16:52.303
What is it?

16:52.345 --> 16:53.680
This one's hash

16:53.721 --> 16:55.473
but I got some weed in these ones...

16:53.721 --> 16:55.473
No.

16:55.515 --> 16:57.099
And this one here actually is honey oil.

16:57.141 --> 16:59.185
No, that looks like it would take my

16:57.141 --> 16:59.185
fucking head off.

16:59.226 --> 17:00.603
We've got a job. Let's go.

17:00.645 --> 17:02.438
You guys ready? Let's go! Come on!

17:02.480 --> 17:04.315
Fuckin' love this place, boys.

17:02.480 --> 17:04.315
Fucking asshole.

17:04.357 --> 17:05.775
I might move here. Let's go.

17:05.817 --> 17:08.194
I'm not wasting these fuckers.

17:05.817 --> 17:08.194
Jesus Christ!

17:08.235 --> 17:09.779
You're fucking selfish, man!

17:08.235 --> 17:09.779
Selfish?

17:09.821 --> 17:11.614
You know, you're selfish!

17:11.656 --> 17:13.616
Yeah? Who had to wear the cock around the city

17:11.656 --> 17:13.616
all by themselves?

17:13.658 --> 17:14.993
Looked like an idiot! Well, you know what?

17:15.034 --> 17:16.619
You're not in charge of the money any more!

17:16.661 --> 17:18.287
I don't need money any more.

17:16.661 --> 17:18.287
I've got drugs.

17:18.329 --> 17:19.998
Look at this hash! I feel fantastic!

17:20.039 --> 17:22.667
Why don't you fucking gear down a little bit?

17:22.709 --> 17:24.126
Why?

17:24.168 --> 17:25.378
(Chuckles)

17:25.419 --> 17:26.796
I fucking love it here.

17:26.838 --> 17:28.422
I wish we could just fucking leave you here.

17:28.464 --> 17:30.299
I wish you could too. Look who it fucking is!

17:30.341 --> 17:32.301
Hope you boys enjoyed Christiania.

17:32.343 --> 17:33.302
Loved it. Had a great time.

17:33.344 --> 17:34.888
You just lost an easy hundred.

17:34.929 --> 17:36.556
Oh, yeah? We're about to make a thousand

17:36.597 --> 17:38.182
when he gets in a fight, so I don't give a fuck.

17:38.224 --> 17:40.267
Nope. Change of plans.

17:40.309 --> 17:41.268
What? What?

17:41.310 --> 17:42.520
Swearnet called.

17:42.562 --> 17:44.022
Said you cheated in the marathon.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.232
The Green Bastard's fighting the champ.

17:46.273 --> 17:48.609
I don't fucking think so. I don't think so.

17:48.651 --> 17:50.444
First of all, I didn't cheat

17:50.486 --> 17:52.446
and I don't even have the Green Bastard suit here.

17:52.488 --> 17:53.865
So it's not happening.

17:53.907 --> 17:56.075
The Green Bastard's rig's at the gym.

17:56.116 --> 17:57.451
So is the champ.

17:57.493 --> 17:59.245
Two shots to the nut sack

17:59.286 --> 18:01.288
or go three rounds with him.

18:01.330 --> 18:02.665
Your choice. And good luck.

18:02.707 --> 18:04.291
He's built like a brick shithouse.

18:05.501 --> 18:07.336
You can do this, man. You can do this.

18:07.378 --> 18:08.337
Boys! Here, have a brownie!

18:08.379 --> 18:09.589
Two shots to the nuts.

18:09.630 --> 18:10.840
Are you guys fucking crazy?

18:10.882 --> 18:12.258
Just tie him up. You'll be fine.

18:12.299 --> 18:14.093
Boys, I'll tell you right now.

18:14.134 --> 18:15.469
There is fucking zero chance

18:15.511 --> 18:17.221
I'm getting in the ring with that guy!

18:17.263 --> 18:18.222
Ricky: Okay, Bubs.

18:18.264 --> 18:19.682
Go through the three rounds, man.

18:19.724 --> 18:21.267
Just tie him up, don't let him hit you.

18:21.308 --> 18:22.936
Just like wrestling, okay?

18:22.977 --> 18:24.687
Bubbles: Yeah, do you know how fucking difficult

18:22.977 --> 18:24.687
that is, Ricky?

18:24.729 --> 18:26.355
It's only here nine minutes.

18:26.397 --> 18:27.815
Holy fuck, boys, that's him.

18:27.857 --> 18:29.316
What?

18:29.358 --> 18:31.277
(Chuckling) Holy fuck! Okay!

18:29.358 --> 18:31.277
What are you talking about!

18:31.318 --> 18:32.904
Motherfucker can hit, man! Holy shit!

18:32.946 --> 18:34.781
(Whispering) I thought it was

18:32.946 --> 18:34.781
a little guy!

18:34.822 --> 18:36.282
It's a heavyweight champion.

18:34.822 --> 18:36.282
That's not him!

18:36.323 --> 18:37.533
Forget the three round thing.

18:37.575 --> 18:39.118
You're going to have to fucking...

18:39.159 --> 18:40.661
dig in the nuts. Are you fucking

18:39.159 --> 18:40.661
kidding me?

18:40.703 --> 18:42.288
How's it going? Come on, you got this one.

18:42.329 --> 18:43.539
Good...

18:43.581 --> 18:44.791
Ricky: Are you Brian?

18:44.832 --> 18:46.459
I'm Brian. Ricky:

18:44.832 --> 18:46.459
Okay.

18:46.500 --> 18:48.127
Oh, I thought you were...

18:48.168 --> 18:49.295
little smaller than that.

18:49.336 --> 18:50.546
You're a big fella.

18:50.588 --> 18:52.131
I'm a little big.

18:52.172 --> 18:54.008
Maybe we could just take it easy in there, then.

18:54.050 --> 18:55.885
Do you want to try me, asshole?

18:57.303 --> 18:59.513
Ricky: Yeah, he's ready. He's ready to

18:57.303 --> 18:59.513
kick some ass.

18:59.555 --> 19:01.348
Ricky! (Chuckling)

19:01.390 --> 19:02.349
Hope you're ready. Bubs, listen.

19:02.391 --> 19:05.103
Ricky! Maybe not taunt the man!

19:05.144 --> 19:06.729
Listen to me. This is the game plan.

19:06.771 --> 19:08.272
Two uppercuts right to the fucking balls.

19:08.314 --> 19:09.899
30 seconds you're out of here,

19:08.314 --> 19:09.899
Exactly.

19:09.941 --> 19:12.151
we're a thousand bucks richer.

19:09.941 --> 19:12.151
Remember that.

19:12.192 --> 19:13.694
(Imitating punch)

19:13.736 --> 19:15.362
Julian: Real quick, man.

19:13.736 --> 19:15.362
Real quick.

19:15.404 --> 19:16.906
Bubbles: Oh, yeah. No problem.

19:16.948 --> 19:18.908
No problem. I'll just fucking...

19:18.950 --> 19:20.785
Whip that off, whip that together.

19:20.827 --> 19:22.536
(Imitating impact) Yeah, man.

19:22.578 --> 19:24.622
Brian: Come on, you fucking pussy!

19:22.578 --> 19:24.622
Here, have a little drink.

19:24.664 --> 19:26.124
Distraction. Uppercut to the nuts.

19:26.165 --> 19:27.291
Brian: Hurry up!

19:27.333 --> 19:28.542
I don't need a fucking drink, Ricky.

19:28.584 --> 19:30.086
Sure? You okay? Yes.

19:30.128 --> 19:31.629
How you feeling? What's your confidence level?

19:31.671 --> 19:33.547
Oh, fuck, Ricky. About 100%.

19:33.589 --> 19:35.382
I'll walk in there

19:35.424 --> 19:36.926
and drop the guy, no problem.

19:36.968 --> 19:39.386
He's coming, he's coming for you.

19:36.968 --> 19:39.386
Ricky!

19:39.428 --> 19:40.387
Better fucking watch yourself!

19:40.429 --> 19:42.932
Hurry up! You fucking pussy.

19:42.974 --> 19:45.351
Bubs, the Green Bastard is afraid of no one.

19:45.392 --> 19:46.769
Remember that.

19:46.811 --> 19:48.938
When it's at fucking Sunnyvale

19:48.980 --> 19:50.940
and I've got everything pre-staged!

19:50.982 --> 19:53.192
Don't give me that shit. Put on the gloves, man.

19:53.233 --> 19:55.153
30 seconds. (Indistinct)

19:55.194 --> 19:57.446
He punches you, he's probably going to fucking kill you.

19:57.488 --> 19:58.698
Strap me in. Good luck, buddy.

19:58.739 --> 20:00.491
Think of the ladies tonight.

20:00.533 --> 20:01.742
Think of the ladies. Come on, you got this.

20:01.784 --> 20:03.953
A thousand fucking Euros!

20:03.995 --> 20:06.539
It's not going to fucking do any good to have ladies

20:03.995 --> 20:06.539
if I'm fucking dead!

20:06.580 --> 20:08.124
Brian: You fucking idiot!

20:08.166 --> 20:09.959
Ricky: Buy you all the drinks

20:08.166 --> 20:09.959
you want tonight, buddy!

20:10.001 --> 20:11.711
And lots of hash! Brian: Come on,

20:10.001 --> 20:11.711
you fucking pussy!

20:11.752 --> 20:13.713
Come on, pussy! All right,

20:11.752 --> 20:13.713
fuckbrains, you ready?

20:13.754 --> 20:15.673
Come on, you little green pussy!

20:15.715 --> 20:17.383
Bubbles: Ricky!

20:15.715 --> 20:17.383
What?

20:17.424 --> 20:19.010
Brian: Come on, pussy!

20:17.424 --> 20:19.010
Don't taunt the man!

20:19.052 --> 20:20.511
You're the fucking pussy!

20:20.553 --> 20:21.762
Go get him, Bubs. Fuck him.

20:21.804 --> 20:23.181
Bubs, you've got it, man. In and out, twice.

20:23.222 --> 20:24.682
That's all you've got to do. 30 seconds.

20:24.724 --> 20:26.184
Don't let him fucking hit you.

20:26.225 --> 20:28.102
It's going to fucking hurt a lot, okay?

20:28.144 --> 20:29.353
So hit him in the nuts twice.

20:28.144 --> 20:29.353
It's not going to hurt.

20:29.395 --> 20:31.313
Just go right up and say "Hey, Mr..."

20:31.355 --> 20:34.108
He's the one calling you names! I wasn't calling you fucking

20:31.355 --> 20:34.108
names!

20:34.150 --> 20:35.943
He doesn't look that tough, you got this,

20:35.985 --> 20:37.778
maybe you should go three fights.

20:35.985 --> 20:37.778
Come on, you fucking pussy!

20:37.820 --> 20:39.363
He's not going to go three fucking rounds.

20:39.405 --> 20:40.823
Two shots to the nuts. Let's go. Come on, man.

20:40.865 --> 20:42.491
Best you can do, is not even think about it.

20:42.533 --> 20:43.492
Get out there, buddy! Let's go.

20:43.534 --> 20:44.952
Ricky! Good luck!

20:46.495 --> 20:48.622
Ah, just before we start here,

20:48.664 --> 20:49.874
I just had a couple questions.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.333
I was wondering if I could...

20:53.794 --> 20:55.254
Ricky: Bubs, I think

20:53.794 --> 20:55.254
he's on to you!

20:55.295 --> 20:56.881
I think he knows you're trying to sucker him!

20:56.923 --> 20:59.466
Bob and weave, Bubs! Bob and weave!

20:59.508 --> 21:00.634
Okay, get out of the corner, Bubs!

21:00.676 --> 21:02.136
This is your chance now! Take it!

21:02.178 --> 21:03.554
Lights out! Two quick ones!

21:02.178 --> 21:03.554
Two quick ones!

21:03.596 --> 21:05.472
Snap snap snap snap!

21:05.514 --> 21:06.849
Two shots! Two shots!

21:06.891 --> 21:08.475
Bubbles: Boys! Throw in

21:06.891 --> 21:08.475
the fucking towel!

21:08.517 --> 21:09.643
For fuck's sakes!

21:09.685 --> 21:11.478
Throw in the towel!

21:11.520 --> 21:12.646
You're a fucking pussy!

21:12.688 --> 21:14.481
Okay, you made your fucking point.

21:14.523 --> 21:16.025
You okay, buddy?

21:16.067 --> 21:17.651
You need a drink? Get back out there?

21:17.693 --> 21:19.653
I got you. I got you, buddy.

21:19.695 --> 21:21.822
Okay, you're good. You're good.

21:21.864 --> 21:23.407
Brian: Get the fuck out of

21:21.864 --> 21:23.407
my gym, you fucking pussy!

21:23.449 --> 21:25.451
There's a stool right there, there

21:23.449 --> 21:25.451
you go, buddy.

21:25.492 --> 21:27.078
Just give him a little drink

21:27.120 --> 21:28.871
and we'll get him back out there.

21:28.913 --> 21:30.664
You okay, man? He was on you, Bubs.

21:30.706 --> 21:33.251
He knew you were trying to hit him in the nuts.

21:30.706 --> 21:33.251
Did I get him?

21:33.292 --> 21:34.501
No. No, man.

21:34.543 --> 21:35.502
No, you missed him both times.

21:35.544 --> 21:36.921
Wasn't even close.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.297
I thought, when we sent Bubbles in there,

21:38.338 --> 21:40.049
we actually had a really good chance.

21:40.091 --> 21:41.675
I mean, all he had to do was go,

21:40.091 --> 21:41.675
like, bang-bang.

21:41.717 --> 21:43.261
Or just two quick shots, boom-boom.

21:43.302 --> 21:44.511
Yeah, he fucked things up big time.

21:43.302 --> 21:44.511
Boom-boo...

21:44.553 --> 21:46.472
Ah, fuck! Dumbass.

21:46.513 --> 21:47.890
Bubs, you okay?

21:47.932 --> 21:49.767
(Mumbling) No... no I just want to...

21:49.809 --> 21:52.019
relax for a second... Brian:

21:49.809 --> 21:52.019
Go home, man!

21:52.061 --> 21:54.480
Ricky: He just needs a few minutes and then we'll get him

21:52.061 --> 21:54.480
back out there.

21:54.521 --> 21:56.482
I'm not going back out, Ricky. It's over!

21:56.523 --> 21:59.110
You're not going back? What do you mean you're

21:56.523 --> 21:59.110
not going back in?

22:00.527 --> 22:01.862
For fuck's sake! I guess we're done.

22:01.904 --> 22:03.697
He beat the living fuck out of me, Julian!

22:03.739 --> 22:07.034
Go home, you fucking idiot! (Chuckling)

22:07.076 --> 22:09.954
You looked like you were holding your own pretty

22:07.076 --> 22:09.954
good there for a bit.

22:09.996 --> 22:11.914
You kidding me?

22:11.956 --> 22:13.916
Bubbles: Well, that went

22:11.956 --> 22:13.916
just as I expected.

22:13.958 --> 22:16.919
I got the living shit kicked out of me.

22:16.961 --> 22:18.504
Didn't make a goddamn cent.

22:18.545 --> 22:20.923
Ricky and Julian say, "Oh, just go in, Bubbles.

22:20.965 --> 22:24.302
It's no big deal. 30 seconds, in and out."

22:24.343 --> 22:27.096
30 seconds to break your goddamn ribs!

22:27.138 --> 22:29.307
Boys, I need some fucking painkillers.

22:29.347 --> 22:32.185
I'm not joking. I think my ribs are snapped.

22:32.226 --> 22:33.769
I think he broke them.

22:33.811 --> 22:35.479
Well, if fuckbrains over here

22:35.521 --> 22:37.148
hadn't spent all of our money

22:35.521 --> 22:37.148
on himself,

22:37.190 --> 22:38.899
we'd have some money to fucking help you

22:37.190 --> 22:38.899
out, man.

22:38.941 --> 22:40.318
I didn't spend it on me.

22:40.358 --> 22:41.694
All the drugs I bought in Christiania,

22:41.735 --> 22:43.361
they were for us, asshole!

22:41.735 --> 22:43.361
Okay,

22:43.403 --> 22:44.697
where are they, then? Huh?

22:44.738 --> 22:46.115
Where's all the drugs?

22:44.738 --> 22:46.115
Well, I did them all.

22:46.157 --> 22:47.533
Well, there you go! Drank most of the booze.

22:47.574 --> 22:49.035
You guys didn't seem like you wanted any!

22:49.076 --> 22:50.953
Julian: Fucking selfish,

22:49.076 --> 22:50.953
that's what!

22:50.995 --> 22:52.788
But that was for us! Another worthless

22:50.995 --> 22:52.788
and weak effort, guys.

22:52.830 --> 22:54.372
You better step up your game

22:54.414 --> 22:56.000
or you're going to fucking starve to death.

22:56.042 --> 22:57.543
Would you go fuck yourself, you asshole?

22:57.584 --> 23:00.587
Look, can we just please go back to the bus.

23:00.629 --> 23:01.964
I just need to lay down.

23:02.006 --> 23:04.133
No. The bus is out getting washed.

23:04.175 --> 23:06.552
Go find something to do for a couple

23:04.175 --> 23:06.552
of hours.

23:06.593 --> 23:09.347
I'm going to go get a steak and see some peelers.

23:09.387 --> 23:11.557
What the fuck are we supposed to do?

23:11.598 --> 23:13.142
(Whimpering)

23:13.184 --> 23:15.561
Let's just go lay on a park bench.

23:15.602 --> 23:17.395
We'll get you a park bench.

23:15.602 --> 23:17.395
Let's go.

23:17.437 --> 23:20.149
Kind of hard to tell if he's making contact

23:17.437 --> 23:20.149
with you. Like...

23:20.191 --> 23:21.775
Julian: Sure it's not just

23:20.191 --> 23:21.775
a shit cramp?

23:21.817 --> 23:23.277
Bubbles: Yeah...

23:23.319 --> 23:38.251
( ♪♪ )

24:51.991 --> 24:54.576
(Seabirds squawking)

25:06.672 --> 25:10.634
Fish: Fuck! Fuck! Fuck off! Fuck!...

25:10.676 --> 25:14.263
Fuck off! Jesus Christ!

25:18.100 --> 25:19.726
(Whisper) Fuck.

25:19.768 --> 25:21.687
(Light clicks off) Fuck off.
