00:01.418 --> 00:04.296
<i>Kids, this is a story about
the time your Uncle Marshall</i>

00:04.296 --> 00:07.090
<i>went before the New York State
Judiciary Committee,</i>

00:07.174 --> 00:10.260
<i>a panel that would decide
the fate of his career.</i>

00:10.344 --> 00:12.429
<i>He thought he'd open
with an icebreaker.</i>

00:12.513 --> 00:16.808
By the way, did I mention
those robes really do you all...

00:16.892 --> 00:18.101
justice?

00:20.020 --> 00:23.398
I'm just saying
that you're all guilty...

00:23.482 --> 00:24.566
of looking sharp.

00:24.650 --> 00:25.651
Mr. Eriksen, please.

00:25.651 --> 00:26.777
You're here to discuss

00:26.777 --> 00:28.695
your conduct in court

00:28.779 --> 00:31.865
during the week
of November 19, 2012.

00:31.949 --> 00:33.408
Of course, Your Honor.

00:33.492 --> 00:35.410
It all started when...

00:35.494 --> 00:37.579
<i>a so-called friend
from law school</i>

00:37.663 --> 00:38.664
<i>conned me into believing</i>

00:38.664 --> 00:40.249
<i>that he needed my help
getting a job,</i>

00:40.249 --> 00:42.835
<i>when in reality,
he stole my firm's strategy</i>

00:42.835 --> 00:44.711
<i>for our upcoming trial against</i>

00:44.795 --> 00:47.756
<i>Gruber Pharmaceuticals, who'd
been polluting a lake upstate.</i>

00:47.840 --> 00:50.425
<i>Turns out,
he was representing Gruber.</i>

00:50.509 --> 00:53.053
Win this case
or you're fired, Eriksen.

00:53.053 --> 00:54.888
How could you trick me
like that?

00:54.972 --> 00:56.682
This is the biggest trial
in my career.

00:56.682 --> 00:58.058
Mine too, brobeans.

00:58.058 --> 00:59.518
When I win this trial,

00:59.518 --> 01:00.811
I'm gonna buy a new car.

01:00.811 --> 01:01.979
Thinking Lambo.

01:01.979 --> 01:03.939
Awesome. I mean, no!

01:03.939 --> 01:05.232
What happened to you?

01:05.232 --> 01:07.234
You used to be, like,
the nicest guy ever.

01:07.234 --> 01:08.527
We were bros.

01:08.527 --> 01:10.445
More than bros.

01:10.529 --> 01:12.739
We ate brunch together.

01:12.823 --> 01:14.283
And I'll always cherish that.

01:14.283 --> 01:16.326
But after Kara
broke my heart again

01:16.410 --> 01:17.661
for the millionth time,

01:17.661 --> 01:19.246
I said screw being nice,

01:19.246 --> 01:21.707
suited up and started lying
to get what I want.

01:21.707 --> 01:22.958
That does happen.

01:22.958 --> 01:25.002
But you used to want to fight
for the little guy.

01:25.002 --> 01:27.337
Little guys pay
with little checks.

01:27.421 --> 01:29.214
But... you already know that.

01:29.298 --> 01:31.341
You're in
environmental law.

01:31.425 --> 01:33.010
Marshall, you have a kid.

01:33.010 --> 01:34.094
How are you
gonna provide

01:34.178 --> 01:35.804
for the little dude's futche?

01:35.888 --> 01:38.724
I'm worried
about Planet Earth's futche!

01:38.724 --> 01:40.893
That's why I'm gonna
kick your ass in this trial.

01:40.893 --> 01:43.770
Sure, you may have swiped our
entire strategy for this case,

01:43.854 --> 01:45.647
but I still got
some tricks up my sleeve

01:45.731 --> 01:47.774
that you know
absolutely nothing about.

01:47.858 --> 01:50.110
- Really?
- No.

02:03.123 --> 02:05.501
<i>Kids, Robin and Barney
had recently shared</i>

02:05.501 --> 02:06.919
<i>an awkward moment.</i>

02:06.919 --> 02:08.045
Whoa, whoa.

02:08.045 --> 02:11.924
<i>After that, they did
what any two mature adults would do.</i>

02:11.924 --> 02:13.008
- Hey!
- Hey!

02:13.008 --> 02:14.426
- How are you?
- Great. You?

02:14.510 --> 02:15.511
Good, so good.

02:15.511 --> 02:17.346
- Oh, great. Good to see you!
- You, too!

02:17.346 --> 02:19.014
<i>They pretended
it never happened.</i>

02:19.014 --> 02:20.098
All right, guys,

02:20.182 --> 02:21.808
this is the biggest case
of Marshall's career.

02:21.892 --> 02:23.018
That is why it's so great

02:23.018 --> 02:24.686
that we all called in sick
to work tomorrow,

02:24.770 --> 02:26.355
so we could be in that
courtroom to support him.

02:26.355 --> 02:27.523
I didn't call in sick.

02:27.523 --> 02:28.607
I called in
for all of us.

02:28.607 --> 02:29.900
Uh, I have strep throat.

02:29.900 --> 02:30.984
Robin, bronchitis.

02:31.068 --> 02:32.236
Barney, massive hemorrhoids.

02:32.236 --> 02:34.238
Why'd you have
to say "massive"?

02:34.238 --> 02:35.822
Well, if you're gonna
miss work for hemorrhoids,

02:35.906 --> 02:37.407
they kind of have
to be massive.

02:37.491 --> 02:39.743
I don't want to sit
in a courtroom all day.

02:39.743 --> 02:42.162
I bet you don't want to sit
anywhere with those hemorrhoids.

02:42.246 --> 02:44.623
I don't have... Shut up.

02:44.623 --> 02:46.333
Look, you guys
wouldn't understand,

02:46.333 --> 02:49.086
but when you have a rap sheet
as long as mine,

02:49.086 --> 02:50.462
the last place
you want to spend

02:50.546 --> 02:51.588
a day is in court.

02:51.672 --> 02:52.798
Rap sheet?

02:52.798 --> 02:54.258
That's right.

02:54.258 --> 02:56.510
When I was a teenager, Lily,

02:56.510 --> 02:58.512
I was a total badass. Pfft.

02:58.512 --> 03:00.973
You want to talk
about teenage badasses?

03:00.973 --> 03:03.892
I was like John Gotti
in a training bra.

03:03.976 --> 03:06.270
I'm serious.

03:06.270 --> 03:08.772
In high school, before
I started dating Scooter,

03:08.856 --> 03:10.607
even he was afraid of me.

03:20.409 --> 03:21.451
Lily coming!

03:21.535 --> 03:22.911
Lily coming!

03:27.416 --> 03:29.626
You look okay.

03:29.710 --> 03:30.878
Want to hang out?

03:30.878 --> 03:33.338
Uh, my mom says I'm only allowed
three friends, so...

03:33.422 --> 03:36.133
Your mom don't make the rules
no more, Scooter.

03:36.133 --> 03:37.593
My name's Jeff.

03:37.593 --> 03:39.803
Not no more it ain't.

03:41.805 --> 03:43.557
The one part of
that story I believe

03:43.557 --> 03:45.475
is that Scooter only
had three friends.

03:45.559 --> 03:47.436
Ah!
Here he is.

03:47.436 --> 03:48.896
The pride of St. Cloud,

03:48.896 --> 03:50.898
the environmental lawyer
we've come to know and love.

03:50.898 --> 03:52.733
He's mean. He's green.

03:52.733 --> 03:54.401
He's not wearing the tie
I bought him for the trial,

03:54.401 --> 03:55.485
but I'm not gonna
mention it...

03:55.569 --> 03:58.864
Marshall "I Was Gonna
Say 'Nice Tie'" Eriksen!

03:59.990 --> 04:02.159
How you feeling,
Counselor?

04:02.159 --> 04:03.410
Well, uh, I mean,
at first

04:03.410 --> 04:04.912
that Brad thing
had me rattled,

04:04.912 --> 04:06.663
but now I feel
pretty good.

04:06.747 --> 04:08.040
I mean, for one thing,

04:08.040 --> 04:09.625
I don't have massive
hemorrhoids. Sorry, buddy.

04:09.625 --> 04:12.044
- I don't have ma...
- And more importantly, unlike Brad,

04:12.044 --> 04:14.630
I actually have something
to fight for.

04:14.630 --> 04:16.632
Pop, because of
your precedent-setting

04:16.632 --> 04:18.634
legal victory 14 years ago,

04:18.634 --> 04:20.260
kids like me can fish
in clean lakes

04:20.344 --> 04:22.387
all over the world.

04:22.471 --> 04:25.140
They sure can, champ.

04:25.224 --> 04:28.227
Because when you
do one good deed...

04:30.646 --> 04:32.773
...it creates
a ripple effect.

04:32.773 --> 04:34.691
One good deed

04:34.775 --> 04:38.320
leads to another and another.

04:38.320 --> 04:39.988
Man, you're wise.

04:40.072 --> 04:42.533
That's probably why I never
have felt the need to do drugs

04:42.533 --> 04:44.076
or rebel in any way.

04:47.955 --> 04:50.582
Anyhoo...

04:50.666 --> 04:52.501
<i>The next day,
we all headed down to court</i>

04:52.501 --> 04:54.378
<i>to support Uncle Marshall.</i>

04:54.378 --> 04:55.796
Yeah.

04:55.796 --> 04:58.006
Want to know what
I looked like at age 15?

04:58.090 --> 04:59.258
There it is.

04:59.258 --> 05:01.093
I don't get it.
That guy wasn't masturbating.

05:01.093 --> 05:03.178
Yeah, and the waistband
of his undies wasn't pulled up

05:03.262 --> 05:04.596
to his Cub Scouts neckerchief.

05:07.099 --> 05:09.685
Ted,
you were never a badass.

05:09.685 --> 05:10.769
<i>Au contraire.</i>

05:10.853 --> 05:12.104
Off to a good start...

05:12.104 --> 05:14.815
I was locked up
plenty of times as a teenager.

05:14.815 --> 05:15.899
Let's just say

05:15.983 --> 05:17.943
Johnny Law was not a fan

05:17.943 --> 05:19.820
of Teddy Westside.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.822
Make sure you get
my good side...

05:21.822 --> 05:24.449
Princess.

05:26.994 --> 05:28.078
You guys want to talk

05:28.078 --> 05:30.163
about hassling
the fuzz?

05:30.247 --> 05:32.249
Finish that, Scoots.

05:34.084 --> 05:36.253
Okay,
let's see some IDs.

05:36.253 --> 05:38.922
Scooter, do you
smell bacon?

05:40.424 --> 05:41.800
Laugh, bitch.

05:41.884 --> 05:43.051
Ha!

05:43.135 --> 05:44.136
Ha ha!

05:44.136 --> 05:45.929
ID now, both of you.

05:49.474 --> 05:51.310
Which one of you
is Yuki Hakutani?

05:51.310 --> 05:53.103
Right here.

05:53.187 --> 05:56.773
So, Yuki, you're 6'1"
and you were born in 1947?

05:56.857 --> 05:59.443
Congratulations.
You can read.

06:04.615 --> 06:06.033
Barney Stinson?

06:06.033 --> 06:09.286
Well, if it isn't
Warren Frankel.

06:09.286 --> 06:11.622
Bailiff
Warren Frankel,

06:11.622 --> 06:13.916
who knows me.
You know,

06:13.916 --> 06:15.501
I almost didn't recognize you
without handcuffs on.

06:15.501 --> 06:18.253
Yeah, I've matured quite
a bit since the old days.

06:18.337 --> 06:19.963
The only time I'm wearing
handcuffs now is, uh,

06:20.047 --> 06:21.048
in the bedroom.

06:21.048 --> 06:23.634
Bondage. I get it.

06:23.634 --> 06:25.761
Well, I have to run.

06:25.761 --> 06:28.222
Stay out of trouble.

06:29.515 --> 06:31.433
Badass.

06:33.310 --> 06:36.146
In summary, I will prove
that Gruber Pharmaceuticals

06:36.230 --> 06:39.358
wantonly and knowingly
polluted Frog Lake

06:39.358 --> 06:42.486
and therefore must pay
restitution of no less

06:42.486 --> 06:44.780
than $25 million.

06:44.780 --> 06:46.615
Thank you.

06:49.159 --> 06:51.370
How's this for a fact:

06:51.370 --> 06:52.538
Frog Lake is home

06:52.538 --> 06:54.581
to a buttload of frogs
and birds.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.042
If it's so polluted,

06:57.042 --> 07:00.379
why don't all those birds fly
to a cleaner lake?

07:00.379 --> 07:02.297
And why don't the frogs
just be like,

07:02.381 --> 07:04.758
"Hey, birds, can I catch
a ride, ribbit?"

07:04.842 --> 07:07.594
Marshall's gonna wipe
the floor with this ding-dong.

07:08.762 --> 07:10.305
Oops.

07:10.389 --> 07:11.473
I seem to have dropped my pen.

07:22.276 --> 07:23.360
Objection, Your Honor.

07:23.360 --> 07:25.529
Nobody needs this long
to pick up a pen.

07:25.529 --> 07:26.738
I'll allow it.

07:33.287 --> 07:36.331
The biggest case of my life
and I'd already lost the jury.

07:36.415 --> 07:38.208
I mean,

07:38.292 --> 07:40.669
I've heard of
<i>Twelve Angry Men</i>,

07:40.669 --> 07:43.463
but this was more
like Twelve Horny Women.

07:43.547 --> 07:45.591
Stay on topic.

07:45.591 --> 07:47.593
I can't compete
with Brad.

07:47.593 --> 07:49.303
The jury is
in love with him.

07:49.303 --> 07:52.389
During recess, one of those
ladies raced across the hall

07:52.389 --> 07:54.141
to see if she could
get a divorce.

07:54.141 --> 07:56.101
And I'm pretty sure
there was some funny business

07:56.185 --> 07:58.687
going on under
that judge's robe.

07:58.687 --> 08:00.898
What you guys saw
Brad do was nothing.

08:00.898 --> 08:03.150
He's taken it to a
whole other level.

08:03.150 --> 08:04.776
Ladies and...

08:04.860 --> 08:07.487
Ladies of the jury,

08:07.571 --> 08:09.823
I'm sorry if I seem down.

08:09.907 --> 08:11.909
My girlfriend Kara...

08:11.909 --> 08:13.243
broke up with me last night.

08:13.327 --> 08:15.245
Aww...

08:15.329 --> 08:17.372
She said I listen too much,

08:17.456 --> 08:19.166
whatever that means.

08:19.166 --> 08:20.959
Aww...
- Aww...

08:23.462 --> 08:24.838
Can you believe this guy?

08:28.550 --> 08:30.093
Really?

08:30.177 --> 08:31.720
Do I even want to see
what I look like?

08:35.682 --> 08:37.851
Wow.

08:37.935 --> 08:40.562
That's, like, super mean.

08:40.646 --> 08:44.274
Next, Brad brought out
his "expert witness."

08:44.358 --> 08:47.277
So, Dr. Bedrosian,
you're saying

08:47.361 --> 08:49.947
that even if Gruber
Pharmaceuticals'

08:49.947 --> 08:54.785
industry-leading drugs
somehow seeped into Frog Lake,

08:54.785 --> 08:57.996
they could actually be
helping the otter population

08:58.080 --> 09:00.749
grow thicker
coats of fur?

09:00.749 --> 09:02.918
Absolutely.

09:02.918 --> 09:05.087
And for the older
birds, who...

09:05.087 --> 09:08.590
maybe don't perform as well
in the bedroom as they used to,

09:08.674 --> 09:09.967
could actually
be having

09:09.967 --> 09:11.552
healthier sex lives?

09:11.552 --> 09:14.012
In my expert opinion...

09:14.096 --> 09:15.848
yes...?

09:15.848 --> 09:18.058
Yes.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.601
So Gruber...

09:19.685 --> 09:21.478
is giving these animals
free medicine.

09:21.562 --> 09:26.400
Medicine that you or I would
have to pay a fortune for if...

09:26.400 --> 09:28.485
we needed help
in the bedroom...

09:28.569 --> 09:29.653
which I don't.

09:31.822 --> 09:34.741
You're so bad.

09:34.825 --> 09:36.076
But I realized,

09:36.076 --> 09:39.788
if Brad could call a quack
as his star witness,

09:39.872 --> 09:41.915
then so could I.

09:43.083 --> 09:45.169
You'll get that in a second.

09:45.169 --> 09:46.962
Meet Paddles,

09:46.962 --> 09:48.046
the duckling.

09:48.130 --> 09:50.549
- "Quack."
- Continue.

09:50.549 --> 09:52.342
Little Paddles here just spent

09:52.426 --> 09:54.303
three months being nursed
back to health.

09:54.303 --> 09:56.013
Why?

09:56.013 --> 09:58.557
Well, because he was found
in Frog Lake

09:58.557 --> 10:01.310
suffering
from acute dermatitis...

10:02.728 --> 10:06.064
...a painful full-body rash,
caused by who?

10:06.148 --> 10:08.275
Gruber Pharmaceuticals.

10:09.693 --> 10:11.737
For a brief, shining moment,

10:11.737 --> 10:14.281
it looked like I might
just win this thing.

10:14.281 --> 10:15.657
But then...

10:15.741 --> 10:19.494
I took a field trip to this
so-called "polluted" lake.

10:19.578 --> 10:20.871
If you'll indulge me,

10:20.871 --> 10:23.624
I'd like to share my experience.

10:23.624 --> 10:28.212
<i>Frog Lake.</i>

10:28.212 --> 10:30.005
<i>Behold...</i>

10:30.005 --> 10:33.550
<i>nature's beauty.</i>

10:33.634 --> 10:34.968
<i>Polluted?</i>

10:35.052 --> 10:36.970
<i>Polluted with good times.</i>

10:39.515 --> 10:41.892
<i>You're dreaming</i>

10:41.892 --> 10:45.479
<i>Frog... Lake.</i>

10:47.147 --> 10:48.732
<i>You're screaming</i>

11:00.160 --> 11:01.620
Frog Lake.

11:01.620 --> 11:02.829
Come on in.

11:02.913 --> 11:05.123
The water's fine.

11:07.960 --> 11:09.586
<i>You're dreaming</i>

11:11.588 --> 11:13.715
I shot and edited that myself.

11:13.799 --> 11:16.927
Yep, I edit stuff, too.

11:18.595 --> 11:21.682
Sorry, Ms. Aldrin,
there's no rap sheet under your name.

11:21.682 --> 11:23.934
Oh, y-you know what,
it must be under

11:23.934 --> 11:26.645
my street tag: Number One Gunna.

11:26.645 --> 11:30.023
Nope. Sorry,
Number One Gunna.

11:30.107 --> 11:32.860
Next!

11:32.860 --> 11:35.195
Those jive-ass turkeys
must've lost it.

11:35.279 --> 11:36.280
Well, they're
pretty swamped

11:36.280 --> 11:38.282
arresting 1970s pimps
like yourself.

11:38.282 --> 11:40.534
Lily, let it go.

11:40.534 --> 11:43.036
I didn't want to brag,
but I think

11:43.120 --> 11:44.162
it's time to acknowledge

11:44.246 --> 11:46.373
that I was the ultimate

11:46.373 --> 11:47.708
teenage badass of this group.

11:49.168 --> 11:51.253
You were a teen
pop star in Canada.

11:51.253 --> 11:53.714
- You sang songs about the mall.
- Hey.

11:53.714 --> 11:56.633
There is a dark side
to being a rocker on the road

11:56.717 --> 11:58.343
north of the 49th.

12:00.304 --> 12:01.597
Mm, thanks.

12:04.558 --> 12:05.559
Hey.

12:05.559 --> 12:07.603
We've received
some noise complaints, eh?

12:07.603 --> 12:09.563
Can you please lower the music?

12:09.563 --> 12:12.399
Oh, yeah. Yeah, sure.

12:12.399 --> 12:13.483
Sure.

12:13.567 --> 12:15.777
How aboot, uh,
I lower the TV, too,

12:15.861 --> 12:16.945
yeah?

12:23.410 --> 12:26.205
Three hours later,
I was arrested

12:26.205 --> 12:29.541
drunk, naked,
and driving a Zamboni.

12:29.625 --> 12:32.586
Man, that DUI drove my insurance
through the roof.

12:34.296 --> 12:35.756
Please be seated.

12:37.549 --> 12:38.926
Mr. Morris,
good seeing you this morning.

12:38.926 --> 12:40.719
Mr. Eriksen...

12:40.719 --> 12:42.346
you're here.

12:42.346 --> 12:44.223
Any, uh,
final witnesses?

12:44.223 --> 12:46.475
Well, Your Honor, um...

12:47.476 --> 12:48.769
um...

12:52.064 --> 12:55.526
actually, Your Honor,
uh, I'm afraid...

12:56.527 --> 12:58.153
Mr. Eriksen?

13:02.491 --> 13:03.909
Your Honor,
I call Brad Morris

13:03.909 --> 13:04.993
to the stand.

13:05.077 --> 13:06.161
Mr. Eriksen, this is

13:06.245 --> 13:07.871
highly irregular.
I would like

13:07.955 --> 13:09.414
Mr. Morris to remove his shirt.

13:09.498 --> 13:11.875
I'll allow it.
Objection, Your Honor,

13:11.959 --> 13:13.502
on grounds that this is ridonk!

13:13.502 --> 13:15.170
Overruled. Take it off.

13:29.268 --> 13:30.853
Acute...

13:30.853 --> 13:32.646
dermatitis,

13:32.646 --> 13:35.274
courtesy of Frog Lake

13:35.274 --> 13:37.860
and Gruber Pharmaceuticals.

13:39.111 --> 13:41.738
That was badass.

13:41.822 --> 13:43.115
So, in the end,

13:43.115 --> 13:46.743
one might say you were forced
to do something...

13:46.827 --> 13:47.828
rash?

13:47.828 --> 13:50.789
Rash!

13:50.873 --> 13:53.458
You know, I had that one,
but Lily told me to cut it.

13:53.542 --> 13:55.711
Um, anyway...

13:55.711 --> 13:57.838
all that was left
was the verdict.

13:59.131 --> 14:03.468
"We, the jury,
find Gruber Pharmaceuticals...

14:03.552 --> 14:04.887
guilty."

14:04.887 --> 14:06.722
Yes!

14:08.974 --> 14:10.642
$25 million.

14:10.726 --> 14:14.313
That tie is not only
tasteful; it's lucky!

14:14.313 --> 14:19.151
I hereby fine Gruber
in the amount of $25,000.

14:19.151 --> 14:20.235
Court is adjourned.

14:28.076 --> 14:31.622
Your Honor, $25,000?
What just happened?

14:31.622 --> 14:34.541
Son, yes, Gruber Pharmaceuticals
probably polluted that lake,

14:34.625 --> 14:36.376
but I'm not gonna ruin
an important company

14:36.460 --> 14:38.086
just because they gave
some bird a rash.

14:38.170 --> 14:40.130
No, but it's thousands of birds,

14:40.214 --> 14:42.007
- and fish and otters and turtles...
- Look, Eriksen,

14:42.007 --> 14:43.091
I hate to cut you short,

14:43.175 --> 14:45.093
but I got tickets to <i>Annie</i>
and my wife is waiting.

14:45.177 --> 14:49.014
You have a wi...
Won... Wonderful show to see?

14:49.014 --> 14:50.390
Guilty. <i>Ciao</i>.

14:54.728 --> 14:56.522
You'd best get
your mind right, son!

14:56.522 --> 14:58.857
The game is the game,
and there ain't no winners.

14:58.941 --> 15:01.944
How many retired
gangbangers you know?

15:01.944 --> 15:03.862
Exactly.

15:07.950 --> 15:09.910
Barney...

15:09.910 --> 15:10.994
check it out.

15:11.078 --> 15:12.538
I found my scrapbook
from the old days.

15:12.538 --> 15:13.622
We're kind of busy
right now, Warren.

15:13.622 --> 15:15.207
We're scaring kids
straight, so...

15:15.207 --> 15:16.333
- No, no.
- Barney was

15:16.333 --> 15:18.585
the youngest member
of our Magic Enthusiasts Club

15:18.669 --> 15:20.295
years back.

15:20.379 --> 15:22.089
Famous for
escaping from handcuffs.

15:22.089 --> 15:23.298
Handcuffs, huh?

15:23.382 --> 15:24.383
Very tiny hands.

15:24.383 --> 15:26.552
That was his secret.

15:26.552 --> 15:28.637
See you around, baby hands.

15:30.013 --> 15:33.851
So, you don't know the bailiff
because you were a badass.

15:33.851 --> 15:36.770
You knew him because you guys
were in a nerd club together.

15:36.854 --> 15:40.607
Where you dazzled audiences
with your sleight-of-tiny-hand.

15:40.691 --> 15:43.735
So I was a late hand bloomer!

15:43.819 --> 15:45.612
Go ahead, laugh,

15:45.696 --> 15:47.114
laugh like all the others,

15:47.114 --> 15:50.617
but those magicians pulled off
the greatest trick of all:

15:50.701 --> 15:52.953
they accepted me.

15:54.955 --> 15:56.707
Okay, well,
to be fair,

15:56.707 --> 15:59.543
I... may have
slightly exaggerated

15:59.543 --> 16:01.837
my badass story, too.

16:03.005 --> 16:05.549
Oh, sorry. Uh, no,
thank you, housekeeping.

16:05.549 --> 16:06.717
I've already made my bed.

16:06.717 --> 16:10.929
And I only used
one washcloth, so it's...

16:11.013 --> 16:12.848
Congratulations,
Miss Sparkles.

16:12.848 --> 16:15.267
On behalf
of the Manitoba Hotel

16:15.267 --> 16:18.020
and Curling Rink Association,
we'd like to thank you

16:18.020 --> 16:21.648
for being the nicest, most
well-behaved hotel guest ever.

16:21.732 --> 16:23.984
Oh, yippee!

16:23.984 --> 16:25.903
What a loser!

16:25.903 --> 16:27.571
Your story's not true,
either, is it, Ted?

16:27.571 --> 16:30.365
Not at all.

16:30.449 --> 16:32.826
Make sure you get
my good side, Princess!

16:35.746 --> 16:37.456
I left the courthouse that day

16:37.456 --> 16:40.792
questioning what
I was even doing with my life...

16:40.876 --> 16:43.128
and then that night,
I had a dream.

16:43.212 --> 16:45.214
Sorry I failed, son.

16:45.214 --> 16:47.799
What about your
Pebble Theory, Dad?

16:47.883 --> 16:50.636
One good deed ripples out
and makes another and another?

16:50.636 --> 16:53.180
Yeah.

16:53.180 --> 16:54.598
This is what really happens

16:54.598 --> 16:57.518
when you throw a pebble
into Frog Lake.

17:01.980 --> 17:04.066
The truth is,
you can fight

17:04.066 --> 17:07.486
your whole life to do good
and still get nowhere.

17:07.486 --> 17:08.612
You're wrong.

17:08.612 --> 17:11.114
Some good's gonna ripple
out of this, Dad.

17:11.198 --> 17:13.158
I promise.

17:15.661 --> 17:17.788
Great, I've angered the Frog King.

17:19.665 --> 17:23.210
Later that night,
some good did ripple out.

17:24.545 --> 17:27.089
Hey.

17:27.089 --> 17:29.091
What, are you here to gloat?

17:29.091 --> 17:32.219
No. Came here to thank you.

17:32.219 --> 17:35.389
For reminding me
of why I got into law in the first place:

17:35.389 --> 17:37.808
to fight for the little guy.

17:37.808 --> 17:40.394
Which is why
I said <i>"Hasta Lucia"</i> to my firm,

17:40.394 --> 17:42.354
and took a job
at your firm, brobeans.

17:42.354 --> 17:44.481
Don't "brobeans" me.

17:44.565 --> 17:47.651
My boss would never hire you
after the way you lied to us.

17:47.651 --> 17:50.028
I told him I'd take every
last bit of manipulation,

17:50.112 --> 17:52.406
deception, and accidental
pen-dropping

17:52.406 --> 17:56.368
I used against you guys and
put it towards saving the world.

17:56.368 --> 17:57.452
Even if that's true,

17:57.536 --> 18:00.914
I'm still not sure
that I can forgive you.

18:00.998 --> 18:03.375
Would you object to
an 11:15 brunch rezzy for two

18:03.375 --> 18:05.502
tomorrow at the Popover Pantry?

18:08.714 --> 18:12.217
- I'll allow it.
- Yes! The Brunch Bros are back!

18:14.386 --> 18:17.222
And thank God we were, because...

18:17.306 --> 18:21.143
well, what he said next is the reason
that I'm sitting in this chair.

18:21.143 --> 18:25.189
Seriously, thanks
for giving my soul a little redempsh.

18:25.189 --> 18:28.483
And B-T-dubs,
that judge was an idiot.

18:28.567 --> 18:30.444
It's people like you,

18:30.444 --> 18:33.614
people with hope
and vision and integ,

18:33.614 --> 18:36.450
that should be behind that bench
making the calls.

18:37.910 --> 18:40.913
And that's when I realized
I wanted to be a judge.

18:40.913 --> 18:43.957
Because judges are the ones
who can effect real change.

18:44.041 --> 18:45.792
And that's why I'm here,

18:45.876 --> 18:48.837
before the New York State
Judiciary Committee.

18:48.921 --> 18:51.548
I hope that you will consider me

18:51.632 --> 18:54.343
for an appointment
to a judgeship.

18:54.343 --> 18:55.761
Thank you, Mr. Eriksen.

18:55.761 --> 18:58.722
The panel will take this
under advisement.

18:58.722 --> 19:00.766
Take your time.

19:02.476 --> 19:04.311
It could be a few months.

19:06.647 --> 19:08.023
Better tell my wife
I won't be home for dinner.

19:08.023 --> 19:09.358
Get out.

19:14.530 --> 19:15.614
Hey.

19:15.614 --> 19:16.782
- Hey!
- How are you?

19:16.782 --> 19:20.786
- Uh, great. You?
- So gr...

19:20.786 --> 19:22.496
Can we talk about this
for a second?

19:22.496 --> 19:24.748
Yeah.

19:24.748 --> 19:27.918
It is super-weird between us,
and I don't want it to be.

19:27.918 --> 19:29.127
Me, neither.

19:29.211 --> 19:31.547
So let me just say this.

19:31.547 --> 19:33.131
I'm done.

19:33.215 --> 19:35.926
You don't have
to worry anymore.

19:35.926 --> 19:39.012
- What do you mean?
- I'm done trying to get you.

19:39.096 --> 19:40.764
I can't do it anymore.

19:40.848 --> 19:42.474
I'm sorry it's taken me
this long to figure it out,

19:42.558 --> 19:45.602
but I promise...

19:45.686 --> 19:48.146
I'm done making
a fool of myself.

19:48.230 --> 19:50.065
Barney, you haven't been making
a fool out of yourself...

19:50.065 --> 19:51.984
It's okay. It's okay.

19:51.984 --> 19:54.778
I want it to be okay.

19:54.862 --> 19:56.363
So here's what's
gonna happen.

19:56.363 --> 19:58.740
I'm gonna get us two drinks,

19:58.824 --> 20:01.577
come back and comment
on the likely size and color

20:01.577 --> 20:03.787
of the nipples
on that redhead at the bar,

20:03.871 --> 20:06.123
with the big, dark nipples.

20:06.123 --> 20:07.624
And you're gonna
be grossed out,

20:07.708 --> 20:09.918
but you're gonna laugh a little anyway,
and then you'll tell

20:10.002 --> 20:13.088
a funny story about
"that bitch Patrice" at work,

20:13.172 --> 20:15.048
but neither one of us
are gonna say,

20:15.132 --> 20:17.259
"Hey, how's it going?"
or "Good to see you!"

20:17.259 --> 20:20.179
Because it really will be
good to see you.

20:22.347 --> 20:24.016
Think we can swing that?

20:25.309 --> 20:26.476
Yeah, I do.

20:28.353 --> 20:30.314
Badass.

20:41.658 --> 20:42.951
Huh.

20:47.664 --> 20:50.334
Thanks for your support, guys.
It means a lot.

20:52.127 --> 20:54.379
We'll call in sick anytime
you have a problem.

20:58.842 --> 21:01.303
Lily coming!

21:04.097 --> 21:05.641
Badass.
