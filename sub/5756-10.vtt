00:00.501 --> 00:03.736
<i> PREVIOUSLY ON</i> PRETTY
LITTLE LIARS...

00:03.738 --> 00:05.237
HANNA, WE HAVE
TO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS.

00:05.239 --> 00:07.306
THIS IS
A ONE-PAYCHECK FAMILY,

00:07.308 --> 00:09.808
AND WE CAN NO LONGER LIVE
A TWO-PAYCHECK LIFE.

00:09.810 --> 00:11.777
I LOVE THIS SONG.
B-26.

00:11.779 --> 00:13.779
( thunder crashes )

00:13.781 --> 00:15.848
IT WAS ONE KISS!
LISTEN TO ME, ALISON.

00:15.850 --> 00:17.583
OR WHAT?
<i> IF YOU SAY ONE WORD</i>

00:17.585 --> 00:19.284
<i> TO MY SISTER</i>
<i> ABOUT IAN,</i>

00:19.286 --> 00:21.120
<i> I WILL TELL EVERYONE THE TRUTH</i>
<i> ABOUT THE JENNA THING.</i>

00:21.122 --> 00:23.822
IAN? WAIT,
MELISSA'S IAN?

00:23.824 --> 00:25.190
( shutter clicking )

00:27.595 --> 00:28.560
WHERE ARE THE PICTURES?

00:34.268 --> 00:35.701
I'M TRYING TO FIND A WAY

00:35.703 --> 00:37.770
TO TELL YOU ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED LAST SUMMER.

00:37.772 --> 00:40.005
<i> TOBY, YOU'RE</i>
<i> SCARING ME.</i>

00:40.007 --> 00:42.107
EMILY, WAIT!

00:42.109 --> 00:43.876
( sirens blaring )

00:43.878 --> 00:45.778
SO, WHERE'S TOBY NOW?
WE DON'T KNOW.

00:45.780 --> 00:48.180
LOOKS LIKE HE HANDED HER OVER
TO A NURSE AND RAN OFF.

00:48.182 --> 00:50.115
<i> Spencer: TOBY CALLED ALISON</i>
<i> THE NIGHT SHE DIED?</i>

00:50.117 --> 00:52.684
HE DID, OR SOMEBODY ELSE DID
USING HIS PHONE.

00:52.686 --> 00:55.988
<i> Hanna: SO, IS TOBY DEAD?</i>
<i> Emily: I COULDN'T BRING</i>
<i> MYSELF TO ASK.</i>

00:55.990 --> 01:00.826
"THANKS FOR GETTING TOBY
OUT OF MY WAY. - 'A'"

01:00.828 --> 01:05.164
¶¶

01:05.166 --> 01:08.133
OKAY, I NEED TO ASK
YOU GUYS SOMETHING,

01:08.135 --> 01:11.537
AND I NEED YOU TO BE
TOTALLY HONEST WITH ME.

01:11.539 --> 01:12.604
Spencer:
OF COURSE.

01:14.108 --> 01:16.642
IS THIS SIDE OF MY FACE
FATTER THAN THIS SIDE?

01:19.180 --> 01:20.979
NO.
NO.

01:23.417 --> 01:26.351
IS THAT IAN?

01:26.353 --> 01:29.021
Emily: YEAH. I HEAR HE'S
THE NEW FIELD HOCKEY COACH.

01:29.023 --> 01:30.856
DOES MELISSA
KNOW HE'S BACK?

01:30.858 --> 01:32.891
I DON'T KNOW WHY
SHE EVER BROKE UP
WITH HIM.

01:32.893 --> 01:34.893
SHE DIDN'T.
HE BROKE UP WITH HER.

01:34.895 --> 01:37.563
HEY. THE FIRST ONE'S
FOR MY BESTIE,

01:37.565 --> 01:39.031
AND ONE FOR EACH
OF YOU,

01:39.033 --> 01:40.699
MY BESTIE'S
OTHER FRIENDS.

01:40.701 --> 01:42.835
OH, UH...
WHAT'S THIS?

01:42.837 --> 01:44.636
OH, NOTHING.
ONLY AN INVITATION

01:44.638 --> 01:47.106
TO THE MOST AWESOME
BIRTHDAY PARTY EVER--

01:47.108 --> 01:48.474
CAMP MONA.

01:52.246 --> 01:53.512
CAMP MONA?

01:53.514 --> 01:56.048
DON'T LET THE CAMPING
PART SCARE YOU.

01:56.050 --> 01:57.749
IT'S "GLAMPING,"
NOT CAMPING.

01:57.751 --> 02:00.052
"M" IS FOR MONA
AND MASSAGES,

02:00.054 --> 02:01.687
NOT MOSQUITOES.

02:01.689 --> 02:04.223
OH, NAOMI, RILEY!
HEY, WAIT UP!

02:06.527 --> 02:10.262
WHY IS MONA INVITING US
TO HER BIRTHDAY PARTY?

02:10.264 --> 02:12.097
SHE KNOWS THAT
WE'RE FRIENDS AGAIN,

02:12.099 --> 02:14.900
AND SHE'S JUST TRYING
TO REACH OUT TO YOU.

02:14.902 --> 02:16.969
SHE'S TRYING TO BE NICE.

02:16.971 --> 02:18.403
SO, ARE YOU GONNA GO?

02:19.773 --> 02:21.406
I KNOW SHE'S
YOUR FRIEND, BUT...

02:21.408 --> 02:22.975
Aria: I'M GONNA
HAVE TO PASS.

02:22.977 --> 02:24.643
I'VE GOT THIS...

02:24.645 --> 02:26.745
I GOT A LOT OF STUFF
TO DO THIS WEEKEND.

02:26.747 --> 02:27.746
ME TOO.

02:27.748 --> 02:30.916
( ringtones playing )

02:36.891 --> 02:40.425
"CAMP MONA'S A SCAVENGER
HUNT AND I'M THE PRIZE."

02:40.427 --> 02:42.928
"COME AND FIND ME,
BITCHES."

02:42.930 --> 02:44.630
All: "A."

02:49.503 --> 02:50.769
The Pierces:
<i> ¶ GOT A SECRET ¶</i>

02:50.771 --> 02:52.271
<i> ¶ CAN YOU KEEP IT? ¶</i>

02:52.273 --> 02:54.306
<i> ¶ SWEAR THIS ONE YOU'LL SAVE ¶</i>

02:54.308 --> 02:56.909
<i> ¶ BETTER LOCK IT</i>
<i> IN YOUR POCKET ¶</i>

02:56.911 --> 02:59.578
<i> ¶ TAKING THIS ONE</i>
<i> TO THE GRAVE ¶</i>

02:59.580 --> 03:01.680
<i> ¶ IF I SHOW YOU</i>
<i> THEN I KNOW YOU ¶</i>

03:01.682 --> 03:04.783
<i> ¶ WON'T TELL WHAT I SAID ¶</i>

03:04.785 --> 03:06.985
<i> ¶ 'CAUSE TWO</i>
<i> CAN KEEP A SECRET ¶</i>

03:06.987 --> 03:08.854
<i> ¶ IF ONE OF THEM IS DEAD ¶</i>

03:11.992 --> 03:15.294
TALK TO A REPRESENTATIVE.

03:15.296 --> 03:18.263
( over-enunciating )
TALK TO A REPRESENTATIVE.

03:20.601 --> 03:22.834
UGH! SCREW YOU!

03:22.836 --> 03:24.403
IS EVERYTHING ALL RIGHT?

03:24.405 --> 03:25.837
UH, YEAH.

03:25.839 --> 03:27.339
CAN I HELP?

03:27.341 --> 03:28.774
I'M HANDLING IT.

03:28.776 --> 03:30.242
( doorbell rings )

03:34.381 --> 03:36.415
( redial tones beeping )

03:36.417 --> 03:38.050
( ringing )

03:38.052 --> 03:40.085

03:47.928 --> 03:50.562
HAPPY BIRTHDAY!
HI.

03:50.564 --> 03:52.264
THE BIRTHDAY GIRL
WANTS TO BE SHOPPING

03:52.266 --> 03:55.000
THE SECOND THE STORES OPEN
AND HAVE LUNCH AT RIVE GAUCHE.

03:55.002 --> 03:56.501
EXCUSE ME?

03:56.503 --> 03:59.805
DID I SAY LUNCH? MY BAD.
IT'S DINNER AT RIVE GAUCHE.

03:59.807 --> 04:01.340
AFTER SCHOOL.

04:01.342 --> 04:02.941
MONA.

04:02.943 --> 04:04.176
MRS. M.

04:04.178 --> 04:05.444
I'M SERIOUS.

04:05.446 --> 04:06.478
ME TOO.

04:11.352 --> 04:13.385
OKAY, SO, SHOULD WE MEET
AFTER FIRST PERIOD

04:13.387 --> 04:15.020
OR JUST BAIL
ON SCHOOL COMPLETELY?

04:15.022 --> 04:16.855
NO, YOU HEARD MY MOM.
I CAN'T DITCH.

04:16.857 --> 04:19.191
YEAH, SO? I DON'T SEE

04:19.193 --> 04:21.493
A LOCATOR BRACELET
ON THAT ANKLE.

04:21.495 --> 04:23.462
LOOK, MONA, I REALLY
WANT TO GO WITH YOU--

04:23.464 --> 04:26.131
HANNA, DO YOU WANT
TO BE MY FRIEND OR NOT?

04:26.133 --> 04:27.633
BECAUSE LATELY I'M FEELING

04:27.635 --> 04:29.635
LIKE YOU'RE EVERYBODY'S
FRIEND BUT MINE.

04:29.637 --> 04:33.105
YOU'RE EITHER WITH SEAN
OR SHIM OR THE OTHERS.

04:33.107 --> 04:35.807
THIS IS OUR SPECIAL DAY,
AND IF YOU SCREW IT UP

04:35.809 --> 04:37.809
I'M NOT TURNING
THE OTHER CHEEK.

04:37.811 --> 04:40.045
IF YOU DISAPPOINT ME,
I'M GOING ROGUE.

04:40.047 --> 04:42.147
MONA, COME ON, YOU KNOW
THAT I'M YOUR FRIEND

04:42.149 --> 04:44.149
AND I TOTALLY WANT
TO CELEBRATE WITH YOU,

04:44.151 --> 04:46.151
IT'S JUST... THINGS HAVE

04:46.153 --> 04:48.987
JUST BEEN A LITTLE TIGHT
AROUND HERE.

04:48.989 --> 04:50.922
EVER SINCE MY DAD LEFT,

04:50.924 --> 04:52.658
IT REALLY HASN'T BEEN
THAT EASY TO--

04:52.660 --> 04:53.625
HANNA.

04:55.029 --> 04:57.362
I COMPLETELY FORGOT.

04:57.364 --> 05:00.065
I'M GONNA BE WORKING LATE
TONIGHT, SO...

05:05.239 --> 05:07.973
THIS SHOULD
COVER DINNER, RIGHT?

05:07.975 --> 05:10.642
NO, MOM, I REALLY
DON'T NEED THAT.

05:16.216 --> 05:18.250
HAPPY BIRTHDAY, MONA.
DON'T FORGET TO LOCK UP.

05:20.454 --> 05:23.322
OOH, BEN FRANKLIN. SCORE.

05:28.429 --> 05:31.663
OH, UM, I WAS GONNA
DO THE LAUNDRY TONIGHT.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.765
THIS PLACE IS
OUT OF CONTROL.

05:33.767 --> 05:36.535
YEAH, WELL, I GUESS WE'RE
ALL GONNA HAVE TO PITCH IN

05:36.537 --> 05:38.203
A LITTLE BIT MORE
AROUND HERE.

05:38.205 --> 05:39.705
MAYBE WE COULD
TAKE TURNS.

05:39.707 --> 05:42.007
WE EACH CHOOSE
A NIGHT TO, UH, COOK

05:42.009 --> 05:43.842
AND THEN DO THE LAUNDRY
AND THEN PAY THE BILLS

05:43.844 --> 05:45.344
AND THEN HELP YOUR BROTHER
WITH HIS HOMEWORK.

05:45.346 --> 05:47.179
AND THEN FIND TIME
TO GRADE PAPERS

05:47.181 --> 05:49.114
AND WRITE LECTURES
AND GO TO PTA MEETINGS.

05:49.116 --> 05:52.384
DAD, HOW MUCH COFFEE
HAVE YOU HAD?

05:52.386 --> 05:55.253
( sighs )

05:55.255 --> 05:57.856
ARE YOU STILL HAVING LUNCH
WITH YOUR MOM TOMORROW?

05:57.858 --> 06:00.859
YEAH.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.294
AT THE GRILL?

06:02.296 --> 06:04.663
YEP.

06:04.665 --> 06:08.533
WHAT DO YOU THINK SHE WOULD
DO IF I WERE TO COME ALONG?

06:08.535 --> 06:11.036
UM, I DON'T KNOW.

06:11.038 --> 06:13.605
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST CALL HER AND ASK?

06:13.607 --> 06:17.042
DAD, NO. THAT'S DIRTY.

06:17.044 --> 06:20.512
( sighs )

06:20.514 --> 06:22.547
WHAT'S STOPPING YOU?

06:22.549 --> 06:24.649
SHE ASKED ME
FOR SPACE.

06:24.651 --> 06:26.151
SHE MOVED OUT.

06:26.153 --> 06:28.453
HOW MUCH MORE SPACE
DOES SHE NEED?

06:35.262 --> 06:36.628
GOOD MORNING.

06:47.307 --> 06:48.440
JUICE?

06:50.144 --> 06:52.611
WHY ARE YOU BEING
NICE TO ME?

06:55.649 --> 06:57.416
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME
IAN WAS BACK?

06:59.453 --> 07:02.287
BECAUSE NORMAL FOR US
IS NOT SPEAKING.

07:02.289 --> 07:05.090
HE TOLD ME HE SAW YOU
AT ALISON'S MEMORIAL.

07:05.092 --> 07:06.858
WELL, WE DIDN'T TALK.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.627
HE ASKED ME OUT
FOR COFFEE.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.095
THAT'S GOOD, RIGHT?

07:10.097 --> 07:12.664
IAN BROKE MY HEART,
SPENCER,

07:12.666 --> 07:14.833
AND I'M STILL
GETTING OVER WREN,

07:14.835 --> 07:16.234
SO I SAID NO.

07:16.236 --> 07:18.603
I'M REALLY SORRY
ABOUT WREN, MELISSA.

07:18.605 --> 07:20.972
I REALLY AM.

07:22.676 --> 07:23.942
YEAH.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.984
UH, NO. HERE.
LET ME SHOW YOU.

07:34.922 --> 07:37.255
AHEM. OKAY.
LIKE THIS.

07:37.257 --> 07:39.057
OKAY?
MM-HMM.

08:07.955 --> 08:09.354
DID YOU LIKE THAT?

08:10.791 --> 08:12.324
MAYBE.

08:15.128 --> 08:16.795
AHEM.

08:16.797 --> 08:18.663
WELL, UH...

08:18.665 --> 08:21.166
I'LL SEE YOU
ON THE FIELD, OKAY?

08:21.168 --> 08:22.133
OKAY.

08:25.873 --> 08:27.439
OKAY, GROSS.

08:29.877 --> 08:31.576
WHAT DID YOU SEE?

08:31.578 --> 08:33.812
ENOUGH TO MAKE ME
WANT TO PUKE.

08:33.814 --> 08:35.514
HE'S YOUR
SISTER'S BOYFRIEND,

08:35.516 --> 08:37.849
AND HE'S, LIKE, OLD.

08:37.851 --> 08:41.920
WELL, IT WAS NOTHING.
JUST FORGET IT, OKAY?

08:41.922 --> 08:43.622
IT LOOKED LIKE
YOU WERE INTO IT.

08:43.624 --> 08:45.457
WELL, I WASN'T.

08:45.459 --> 08:47.192
I HOPE NOT,

08:47.194 --> 08:51.496
BECAUSE IF WERE WERE,
THAT WOULD MAKE YOU A SKANK.

08:51.498 --> 08:54.399
<i> THAT WOULD MAKE YOU</i>
<i> A SKANK.</i>

08:54.401 --> 08:57.669
( period bell rings )

08:57.671 --> 09:00.405
IT'S A BUMMER CAMP MONA'S
A GIRLS-ONLY PARTY.

09:00.407 --> 09:02.307
I WAS HOPING TO SEE
YOU THIS WEEKEND.

09:02.309 --> 09:03.909
YEAH, WELL,
THERE'S SUNDAY.

09:03.911 --> 09:05.877
WE COULD...

09:05.879 --> 09:09.247
LAY AROUND BEING LAZY TOGETHER
WATCHING OLD MOVIES ALL DAY?

09:09.249 --> 09:10.582
I LOVE THAT.

09:10.584 --> 09:12.317
THEN IT'S A DATE.

09:15.222 --> 09:16.521
READY TO GO?

09:16.523 --> 09:18.456
OH, WE GOTTA

09:25.165 --> 09:27.832
HOW'S MY TANK? UHH!

09:33.040 --> 09:34.573
HE PLAYS
FOOTBALL, RIGHT?

09:34.575 --> 09:36.741
HE'S ACTUALLY
REALLY SMART...

09:36.743 --> 09:39.377
AND HE'S FUNNY

09:39.379 --> 09:41.179

09:58.298 --> 09:59.564
HEY, WHAT'S
GOING ON?

09:59.566 --> 10:00.899
THE COPS ARE HERE.

10:00.901 --> 10:03.001

I WANT TO SHOW YOU
SOMETHING THAT WAS SENT

10:55.389 --> 10:59.024

THEY'RE AT
THE KISSING ROCK.

BEHIND THE LAKE.

11:39.366 --> 11:42.767
I-I THINK THIS WAS TAKEN
THE NIGHT ALISON DISAPPEARED.

11:42.769 --> 11:45.236
SHE WAS WEARING
THAT YELLOW TOP.

11:45.238 --> 11:47.005
Hanna: WAIT, THAT'S
NOT HER SWEATER.

11:47.007 --> 11:48.473
ARE YOU SURE?

11:48.475 --> 11:50.408
ASK ME WHAT'S IN EACH ONE
OF OUR CLOSETS,

11:50.410 --> 11:51.910
AND I'LL GIVE YOU
AN ITEMIZED LIST.

11:51.912 --> 11:53.745
I KNOW CLOTHES.

11:53.747 --> 11:56.981
I THINK SHE'S TALKING
TO THE OLDER BOY.

11:56.983 --> 12:00.085
SO-CALLED, UH,
MYSTERY BOYFRIEND?

12:00.087 --> 12:03.221
ALISON DIDN'T WANT US
TO KNOW WHO HE WAS.

12:03.223 --> 12:05.290
WAS HE AN OLDER
HIGH SCHOOL BOY?

12:05.292 --> 12:07.792
SHE ONLY TOLD ME ENOUGH
TO MAKE IT A SECRET.

12:07.794 --> 12:11.129
HUH. ALISON LIKED
SECRETS, HUH?

12:11.131 --> 12:14.032
SHE THOUGHT
SHARING SECRETS KEPT US CLOSE.

12:14.034 --> 12:16.468
THEY DO,
BUT SECRETS ARE MADE

12:16.470 --> 12:18.203
TO BE FOUND OUT
WITH TIME.

12:20.006 --> 12:23.174
<i> I KNOW YOU WANT TO KISS ME.</i>

12:23.176 --> 12:25.510
I'M TRYING
TO REFINANCE,

12:25.512 --> 12:28.480
BUT THE HOUSE ISN'T WORTH
AS MUCH AS IT WAS

12:28.482 --> 12:30.548
WHEN I BOUGHT OUT
MY EX.

12:30.550 --> 12:33.585
I JUST NEED
ANOTHER EXTENSION.

12:33.587 --> 12:37.055
<i> I'M SORRY,</i>
<i> BUT YOUR REQUEST IS DENIED.</i>

12:37.057 --> 12:40.725
PLEASE. I'M--
I'M BEGGING YOU.

12:40.727 --> 12:43.361
<i> I'M SORRY, BUT THE ANSWER</i>
<i> IS STILL NO.</i>

12:45.599 --> 12:47.665
OKAY.
<i> HAVE A NICE DAY.</i>

12:49.136 --> 12:50.401
( intercom buzzes )

12:50.403 --> 12:52.137
Woman:<i> MRS. POTTER IS HERE,</i>

12:52.139 --> 12:54.305
<i> AND SHE'D LIKE TO VISIT</i>
<i> HER SAFE-DEPOSIT BOX.</i>

12:54.307 --> 12:57.275
( sighs ) EVERY YEAR,
LIKE CLOCKWORK.

12:57.277 --> 12:58.810
THANK YOU.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.216
MRS. POTTER,
HOW ARE YOU?

13:05.218 --> 13:06.785
I'M OLD.
HOW ARE YOU?

13:08.955 --> 13:11.322
LET ME GET MY KEY.

13:11.324 --> 13:13.491
MY SISTER DIED.

13:13.493 --> 13:14.759
I'M SORRY TO HEAR THAT.

13:16.163 --> 13:18.563
OH... HERE IT IS.

13:21.268 --> 13:23.201
I'M THE LAST POTTER.

13:23.203 --> 13:26.037
WHEN I GO, THAT'S
THE END OF THE LINE.

13:27.841 --> 13:29.073
ARE YOU READY?

13:38.518 --> 13:40.585
HEY.

13:40.587 --> 13:43.922
HEARD YOU GOT CALLED
DOWN TO THE OFFICE.
EVERYTHING OKAY?

13:43.924 --> 13:46.457
YEAH. THERE'S A WOMAN
IN TOWN FROM THE FBI,

13:46.459 --> 13:48.459
AND SHE JUST HAD
A FEW QUESTIONS ABOUT ALISON.

13:50.530 --> 13:52.230
WHAT'S THIS?

13:52.232 --> 13:53.898
I DON'T KNOW.

13:53.900 --> 13:55.567
"A" WANTS YOU
TO READ PAGE 22.

13:57.904 --> 14:00.772
IT'S A POEM
BY EZRA FITZ.

14:00.774 --> 14:03.241
"B-26.
IT'S A NUMBER.

14:03.243 --> 14:06.477
IT'S A SONG.
IT'S A GIRL..."

14:06.479 --> 14:07.512
CAN I HAVE THAT?
SURE.

14:14.354 --> 14:16.754
HAVE A NICE DAY,
THEN.

14:16.756 --> 14:18.223
TAKE CARE.

14:18.225 --> 14:22.727
OH... ARE THOSE BUTTERSCOTCH?

14:22.729 --> 14:24.195
HELP YOURSELF.

14:24.197 --> 14:26.097
THANK YOU.

14:34.507 --> 14:36.941
RIGHT, SEE YA
NEXT YEAR.

14:54.995 --> 14:56.828
UH, YOU DON'T KNOW ME,

14:56.830 --> 14:59.697
BUT I'M IN YOUR FOURTH-PERIOD
SOCIAL STUDIES CLASS.

14:59.699 --> 15:00.865
OKAY.

15:00.867 --> 15:02.533
COULD YOU GIVE ME THE NAME

15:02.535 --> 15:04.002
OF YOUR LIPOSUCTION DOCTOR?

15:05.305 --> 15:07.272
UH, SURE.

15:07.274 --> 15:09.107
IF I HAD ONE.

15:15.815 --> 15:18.349
( chattering )

15:20.687 --> 15:23.688
GOD, THIS DAY JUST
KEEPS GETTING WEIRDER.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.857
I'M SORRY ABOUT LUNCH.
DID YOU GET MY TEXT?

15:25.859 --> 15:28.993
I GOT YOUR TEXT, AND THEN
I GOT A TEXT FROM "A,"

15:28.995 --> 15:31.329
WHOEVER THAT IS, CLUING
ME INTO THE REAL REASON

15:31.331 --> 15:33.197
YOU GOT SKINNY LAST SUMMER.

15:33.199 --> 15:34.933
"A" SENT YOU A TEXT?

15:34.935 --> 15:37.135
I WAS EATING
THREE ALMONDS A DAY,

15:37.137 --> 15:39.103
AND YOU WERE
GETTING LIPOSUCTION?

15:39.105 --> 15:40.438
NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE.

15:41.775 --> 15:43.341
I BOUGHT NAOMI AND RILEY

15:43.343 --> 15:44.776
MATCHING PAJAMAS
FOR MY PARTY.

15:44.778 --> 15:47.078
I WAS GONNA PICK UP
A PAIR FOR YOU,

15:47.080 --> 15:49.080
BUT THEN I REMEMBERED
YOU'RE NOT COMING.

15:49.082 --> 15:51.015
OF COURSE I'M COMING.

15:51.017 --> 15:53.117
COME ON,
YOU KNOW I'D NEVER
MISS YOUR BIRTHDAY.

15:53.119 --> 15:56.220
IT'S INVITE-ONLY, HANNA,
AND YOU'RE UNINVITED.

15:56.222 --> 15:57.755
MONA, YOU'RE
MY BEST FRIEND.

15:57.757 --> 15:59.190
WE<i> WERE</i> BEST FRIENDS.

15:59.192 --> 16:01.960
NOW YOU'RE JUST SOMEBODY
I USED TO HANG OUT WITH.

16:08.501 --> 16:11.769
IT'S NOT LIKE I DIDN'T
GIVE YOU A WARNING.

16:11.771 --> 16:15.473
HANNA, MONA...
RIP CORD.

16:19.179 --> 16:21.145
NAOMI, RILEY.

16:23.049 --> 16:25.016
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

16:25.018 --> 16:26.985
UM, "A" SENT
MONA A TEXT,

16:26.987 --> 16:29.988
AND I THINK SHE JUST
BROKE UP WITH ME.

16:29.990 --> 16:31.789
"A" SENT
MONA A TEXT?

16:31.791 --> 16:33.491
I'M SO OVER
THAT BITCH.

16:34.928 --> 16:37.095
I THOUGHT YOU GUYS
WERE STILL CLOSE.

16:37.097 --> 16:39.430
NOT MONA. "A."
WHAT DID IT SAY?

16:39.432 --> 16:41.466
IT DOESN'T REALLY MATTER.
IT'S ALL LIES.

16:41.468 --> 16:43.501
HANNA, I'M SO SORRY.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.336
I KNOW THAT MONA'S
REALLY IMPORTANT TO YOU.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.305
SHE WAS MY FRIEND
WHEN YOU GUYS WEREN'T.

16:47.307 --> 16:49.140
WELL, WE'RE HERE NOW,

16:49.142 --> 16:51.209
SO IF YOU'RE NOT
GOING TO THE PARTY,

16:51.211 --> 16:53.244
THEN WE'RE NOT
GOING EITHER.
NO.

16:53.246 --> 16:55.413
NO! NO, YOU'RE GOING
ON THAT SCAVENGER HUNT,

16:55.415 --> 16:56.848
AND I'M GOING TOO.

16:56.850 --> 16:59.083
"A" MIGHT BE PLAYING GAMES,
BUT I'M NOT.

17:04.057 --> 17:07.759
¶ STILL TOO YOUNG
TO FAIL ¶

17:12.065 --> 17:16.300
¶ TOO SCARED
TO SAIL AWAY ¶

17:16.302 --> 17:18.669
¶ ONE OF THESE DAYS ¶

17:18.671 --> 17:23.408
¶ I'LL GROW OLD
AND I'LL GROW BRAVE ¶

17:23.410 --> 17:24.942
¶ AND I'LL GO ¶

17:28.715 --> 17:31.249
¶ ONE OF THESE DAYS ¶

17:37.624 --> 17:38.956
I READ YOUR POEM.

17:41.127 --> 17:42.560
"B-26"?

17:42.562 --> 17:44.796
HOW COULD YOU?!

17:44.798 --> 17:47.198
HOW COULD YOU
WRITE THESE WORDS

17:47.200 --> 17:48.666
AND FEEL
THESE FEELINGS

17:48.668 --> 17:50.568
BUT GIVE UP
ON US SO EASILY?

17:50.570 --> 17:53.337
I-I NEVER INTENDED
FOR YOU TO READ THAT.

17:53.339 --> 17:55.139
YOU LET ME BELIEVE
THAT YOU DIDN'T LOVE ME.

17:55.141 --> 17:57.308
I THOUGHT I WAS DOING
THE RIGHT THING.

17:57.310 --> 17:59.310
FOR YOU. NOT FOR ME.

17:59.312 --> 18:00.711
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

18:00.713 --> 18:02.613
OH, ARE WE GONNA TALK
ABOUT TRUTH NOW?

18:02.615 --> 18:05.083
WHAT, TODAY'S TRUTH
OR YESTERDAY'S

18:05.085 --> 18:06.717
OR LAST WEEK'S?
BECAUSE, HONESTLY,

18:06.719 --> 18:09.220
I DON'T KNOW
WHICH OF YOUR STORIES
TO BELIEVE ANYMORE.

18:09.222 --> 18:11.355
THE, UH, "I THOUGHT
ABOUT YOU EVERY SECOND

18:11.357 --> 18:12.657
I WAS GONE" STORY,

18:12.659 --> 18:16.194
OR THE ONES THAT END
WITH "I'M OUTTA HERE"?

18:16.196 --> 18:19.030
BUT IT WASN'T MY AGE
THAT RUINED US, EZRA.
YOU DID.

18:19.032 --> 18:21.466
ARIA, PLEASE.
NO. I'VE MOVED ON.

18:23.169 --> 18:25.236
YOU SHOULD, TOO.

18:25.238 --> 18:26.404
WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

18:30.110 --> 18:31.676
NOTHING.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.847
THERE IS ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING GOING ON HERE.

18:43.189 --> 18:45.990
IS THERE SOMETHING
YOU'D LIKE TO SAY TO ME?

19:11.985 --> 19:13.851
( knocks )

19:15.221 --> 19:16.921
IAN?

19:19.726 --> 19:21.559
AM I ALLOWED IN?

19:21.561 --> 19:24.896
WHAT PART OF ME
NOT RETURNING YOUR CALLS
DO YOU NOT UNDERSTAND?

19:24.898 --> 19:27.098
LOOK, I KNOW YOU
DON'T WANT TO SEE ME,

19:27.100 --> 19:28.499
AND I DON'T BLAME YOU.

19:28.501 --> 19:31.836
YOU BROKE UP WITH ME,
REMEMBER?

19:31.838 --> 19:33.337
I JUST WANNA
TAKE YOU OUT FOR COFFEE.

19:33.339 --> 19:34.639
( scoffs )

19:34.641 --> 19:37.475
YOU GUYS ARE
GOING CAMPING? CUTE.

19:40.613 --> 19:42.713
WAIT.

19:42.715 --> 19:45.750
HEY. HEY.
WAIT.

19:45.752 --> 19:47.985
WHAT?

19:47.987 --> 19:50.254
MAYBE YOU SHOULD
GIVE HIM A CHANCE.

19:50.256 --> 19:53.824
AND YOU'RE SUDDENLY
LOOKING OUT FOR ME BECAUSE...

19:53.826 --> 19:55.293
I DON'T KNOW
WHEN THIS WAR

19:55.295 --> 19:56.928
BETWEEN US GOT
STARTED, MELISSA,

19:56.930 --> 19:58.930
BUT CAN'T IT
JUST BE OVER?

19:58.932 --> 20:01.899
I'M ONLY 16,
AND I'M TIRED.

20:01.901 --> 20:04.001
IS THIS YOU TRYING TO FIX
WHAT YOU BROKE WITH WREN?

20:05.505 --> 20:07.705
NO. JUST TRYING
TO DO THE RIGHT THING.

20:12.912 --> 20:14.478
( sighs )

20:14.480 --> 20:17.081
COFFEE.
THAT'S IT.

20:17.083 --> 20:18.049
OKAY.

20:27.060 --> 20:29.827
SINCE WHEN ARE YOU MENDING
MELISSA'S RELATIONSHIPS?

20:29.829 --> 20:32.296
I KIND OF OWE
IT TO HER.

20:32.298 --> 20:34.565
WHAT'S SHE EVER
DONE FOR YOU?

20:34.567 --> 20:36.300
IT'S MORE ABOUT
WHAT DID I DO TO HER.

20:38.171 --> 20:40.204
I'M THE REASON
SHE AND WREN BROKE UP.

20:40.206 --> 20:44.642
WE HAD A MOMENT, AND...
MELISSA SAW US.

20:44.644 --> 20:46.210
A MOMENT?

20:46.212 --> 20:47.712
YEAH, IT GETS WORSE.

20:50.049 --> 20:52.450
YEAH, MELISSA
DOESN'T KNOW THIS PART.

20:52.452 --> 20:55.586
I ALSO HAD A MOMENT
WITH IAN.

20:55.588 --> 20:57.121
SHUT UP!

20:57.123 --> 21:00.091
IT WAS EARLY IN THE SUMMER
BEFORE ALISON WENT MISSING.

21:00.093 --> 21:01.692
IT WAS JUST ONE KISS,

21:01.694 --> 21:03.861
BUT AFTER THEY BROKE UP
WE STARTED SEEING EACH OTHER.

21:05.531 --> 21:08.266
I FEEL LIKE THE POSTER CHILD
FOR POOR JUDGMENT.

21:08.268 --> 21:10.534
YOU COULD'VE
TOLD US, SPENCER.

21:10.536 --> 21:12.403
REALLY? 'CAUSE ALI KNEW
ABOUT THE FIRST KISS,

21:12.405 --> 21:13.838
AND SHE THOUGHT
I WAS AWFUL.

21:13.840 --> 21:15.439
WELL, WE
ARE NOT ALI.

21:15.441 --> 21:17.975
I SHOULD NOT
TELL MELISSA, RIGHT?

21:17.977 --> 21:19.410
All: ( scoff ) RIGHT.

21:21.214 --> 21:23.314
SPENCE, TURN
THE TV UP.

21:27.887 --> 21:30.621
<i> AUTHORITIES SEARCHED</i>
<i> THE FAMILY HOME EARLIER TODAY,</i>

21:30.623 --> 21:33.424
<i> AND INITIAL REPORTS HAVE</i>
<i> CONFIRMED THAT A BLOODSTAIN</i>

21:33.426 --> 21:36.060
<i> ON THE SWEATER IS A MATCH</i>
<i> TO THE VICTIM'S.</i>

21:36.062 --> 21:38.596
<i> IF YOU JUST TUNED IN,</i>
<i> POLICE HAVE ISSUED A WARRANT</i>

21:38.598 --> 21:42.300
<i> FOR THE ARREST OF MISSING</i>
<i> ROSEWOOD TEEN TOBY CAVANAUGH.</i>

21:42.302 --> 21:45.269
<i> HE IS WANTED FOR THE MURDER</i>
<i> OF ALISON Di LAURENTIS.</i>

21:45.271 --> 21:47.638
THAT SWEATER
IS TOBY'S!

21:47.640 --> 21:50.541
NO, ALISON
WAS NOT DATING TOBY.

21:50.543 --> 21:53.110
THERE'S NO WAY THAT
THAT'S THE GUY SHE'S
TALKING TO IN THE VIDEO.

21:53.112 --> 21:55.313
ARIA, YOU SAW THE NEWS.
THEY HAVE PROOF.

21:55.315 --> 21:58.282
Spencer: IF IT'S TOBY'S SWEATER,
THAN HE HAS TO BE THE BOY
AT THE KISSING ROCK.

22:00.586 --> 22:03.120
IS IT FINALLY OVER?

22:03.122 --> 22:06.624
NO. TOBY'S BEEN
MISSING FOR WEEKS.

22:06.626 --> 22:08.626
IT WON'T BE OVER

22:08.628 --> 22:10.261
UNTIL HE'S
BEHIND BARS.

22:13.333 --> 22:16.300
HOW COULD I BE SO WRONG
ABOUT SOMEONE?

22:16.302 --> 22:19.804
I THINK
THE TOBY YOU KNEW

22:19.806 --> 22:21.672
WASN'T THE TOBY
THAT KILLED ALISON.

22:24.444 --> 22:27.278
WE ALL HAVE
A DARK SIDE.

22:27.280 --> 22:28.779
SHE JUST BROUGHT
HIS TO THE SURFACE.

22:31.117 --> 22:35.052
ALISON WENT MISSING
RIGHT AFTER MY DAD LEFT,

22:35.054 --> 22:39.490
AND I ALWAYS HOPED
THAT WHEN HE CAME BACK
I'D FEEL SAFE AGAIN.

22:39.492 --> 22:41.025
YOU WILL.

22:41.027 --> 22:43.094
( phone rings )

22:43.096 --> 22:45.696
CAN YOU GET THAT?
I THINK IT'S MY MOM.

22:45.698 --> 22:49.166
YOU REALLY WANT HER
TO KNOW WE'RE TOGETHER?

22:49.168 --> 22:50.901
SHE CAN KNOW
WE'RE TOGETHER

22:50.903 --> 22:53.371
WITHOUT KNOWING
WE'RE... TOGETHER.

22:53.373 --> 22:54.839
( chuckles )

22:57.477 --> 22:59.910
EMILY'S PHONE.

22:59.912 --> 23:01.712
HELLO?

23:01.714 --> 23:04.148
( sighs )
IS SOMEBODY THERE?

23:04.150 --> 23:05.549
I CAN HEAR
YOU BREATHING.

23:08.654 --> 23:10.554
HELLO?

23:14.694 --> 23:16.927
( door opens )

23:16.929 --> 23:18.429
MOM?

23:23.236 --> 23:24.635
MOM?

23:27.173 --> 23:28.973
HELLO?

23:28.975 --> 23:31.409
( footsteps )

23:36.315 --> 23:38.616
( laughing )
DAD!

23:38.618 --> 23:39.984
THERE SHE IS!

23:45.725 --> 23:47.958
UH, MAYA?

23:47.960 --> 23:50.227
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
SHE HAD COMPANY.

23:50.229 --> 23:52.830
UM, DAD, THIS IS
MY FRIEND MAYA.

23:52.832 --> 23:54.365
HI!

23:54.367 --> 23:56.767
EMILY'S TALKED
SO MUCH ABOUT YOU.

23:56.769 --> 23:58.936
I'M REALLY HAPPY
TO MEET YOU.

23:58.938 --> 24:00.638
IT'S GOOD TO MEET
YOU TOO, MAYA.

24:00.640 --> 24:03.474
OH, GOD.
LOOK AT YOU.

24:03.476 --> 24:05.443
I THINK WE'RE READY FOR
SOME FAMILY TIME HERE,

24:05.445 --> 24:07.044
SO, UH, MAYA?

24:09.515 --> 24:11.048
OH, UM. SURE.

24:13.319 --> 24:15.352
I'LL, UH, I'LL
CALL YOU LATER.

24:15.354 --> 24:17.855
OKAY.

24:17.857 --> 24:21.492
SO, I HAVE ALL THE FIXINGS
FOR YOUR FAVORITE MEAL,

24:21.494 --> 24:22.793
AND THAT'S A GOOD THING,

24:22.795 --> 24:24.929
BECAUSE BAKED POTATOES
ARE MAKING A COMEBACK.

24:24.931 --> 24:27.364
COME HERE, MY GIRLS.

24:30.102 --> 24:33.804
ALISON, SHE CONVINCED
US THAT SHE HATED TOBY,

24:33.806 --> 24:37.942
AND I TOTALLY
BELIEVED HER.

24:37.944 --> 24:40.511
AH. GUESS SHE WAS
JUST PLAYING A GAME.

24:40.513 --> 24:41.779
PEOPLE AREN'T DOLLS.

24:41.781 --> 24:43.347
YOU CAN'T JUST
PLAY WITH THEM

24:43.349 --> 24:44.949
AND THEN PUT THEM
BACK IN THE BOX.

24:49.255 --> 24:50.988
YOU'VE BEEN PAINTING.

24:50.990 --> 24:53.524
YEAH. FOR YEARS,
I COULDN'T FIND

24:53.526 --> 24:56.227
THE INSPIRATION
TO GET BACK TO IT.

24:56.229 --> 24:58.295
LITTLE DID I KNOW
THAT ALL I NEEDED

24:58.297 --> 25:00.064
WAS SOME LIES
AND INFIDELITY

25:00.066 --> 25:01.699
TO LIGHT THAT FIRE.

25:06.005 --> 25:08.272
DO YOU BLAME ME
FOR KEEPING THAT SECRET?

25:12.445 --> 25:14.745
I WISH YOU
WOULD'VE TOLD ME,

25:14.747 --> 25:16.881
BUT I DON'T
BLAME YOU.

25:16.883 --> 25:19.250
I THOUGHT I WAS
PROTECTING YOU.

25:20.820 --> 25:22.086
I KNOW.

25:23.523 --> 25:27.391
I FEEL THAT I MADE
A REALLY BIG MISTAKE, AND...

25:27.393 --> 25:29.593
I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE
YOU'RE HEARING ME

25:29.595 --> 25:30.794
WHEN I SAY
I'M REALLY SORRY.

25:37.270 --> 25:38.736
I HEAR YOU, BABY.

25:41.140 --> 25:43.541
BUT NO MORE SECRETS,
OKAY?

25:45.111 --> 25:46.510
NO MORE SECRETS.

26:01.661 --> 26:03.894
I'VE BEEN WATCHING
THE NEWS.

26:03.896 --> 26:06.196
ARE YOU OKAY WITH ALL
THIS STUFF YOU'RE HEARING?

26:08.768 --> 26:12.369
I KNOW IT'S SUPPOSED
TO FEEL LIKE CLOSURE,

26:12.371 --> 26:14.505
BUT I ONLY HAVE
MORE QUESTIONS.

26:14.507 --> 26:16.540
YOUR MOM TOLD ME
ABOUT HOMECOMING.

26:19.278 --> 26:21.278
TOBY CAVANAUGH?

26:21.280 --> 26:23.547
IS HE THE REASON YOU
BROKE UP WITH BEN?

26:23.549 --> 26:26.417
HE'S JUST A FRIEND.
A GOOD FRIEND, ACTUALLY.

26:26.419 --> 26:29.420
EMMY,
HE'S DANGEROUS.

26:29.422 --> 26:31.889
YOU KNOW THAT
NOW, RIGHT?

26:31.891 --> 26:32.723
I GUESS.

26:34.160 --> 26:35.960
I JUST DON'T
UNDERSTAND IT.

26:41.434 --> 26:44.368
THE ONLY THING
THAT TOBY CAN GIVE

26:44.370 --> 26:47.871
ALISON'S FRIENDS
AND HER FAMILY NOW IS THE TRUTH.

26:47.873 --> 26:51.008
THERE'S AN HONOR
TO BEING TRUTHFUL.

26:51.010 --> 26:53.410
IT COULD SET
THAT BOY FREE.

26:53.412 --> 26:55.746
BUT WHAT IF WE'RE
NOT READY FOR THE TRUTH?

26:55.748 --> 26:57.214
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

26:57.216 --> 26:59.116
MAYBE IT'LL BE
TOO HARD TO HEAR.

27:00.820 --> 27:03.954
EMMY, YOU KNOW IT'S ALWAYS
BETTER TO BE HONEST

27:03.956 --> 27:06.357
THAN TO TELL A LIE.

27:11.030 --> 27:12.162
DAD...

27:17.370 --> 27:20.237
I MISSED YOU
SO MUCH.

27:20.239 --> 27:22.706
ME TOO, BABY. ME TOO.

27:34.253 --> 27:36.320
( knocking )
KNOCK, KNOCK.

27:39.792 --> 27:42.626
I ACTUALLY HAD
A GOOD TIME WITH IAN.

27:42.628 --> 27:46.130
WOW. I WILL CALL TMZ.

27:49.902 --> 27:51.502
I WAS THINKING ABOUT

27:51.504 --> 27:53.837
WHAT YOU SAID EARLIER,
ABOUT BEING TIRED.

27:53.839 --> 27:57.508
YOU AND I HATING EACH OTHER
HAS BECOME A LOT OF WORK.

27:57.510 --> 28:00.644
I DIDN'T KNOW THAT
WE HATED EACH OTHER.

28:00.646 --> 28:03.480
I JUST-- I THOUGHT WE
DIDN'T LIKE EACH OTHER.

28:05.251 --> 28:06.850
( simpers )

28:10.022 --> 28:12.890
YOU'VE SEEN THE NEWS, RIGHT?

28:12.892 --> 28:14.925
YEP.

28:14.927 --> 28:17.161
ALISON FOOLED US ALL,
DIDN'T SHE?

28:17.163 --> 28:19.863
I REMEMBER HER CONSTANTLY
TRASHING THAT KID,

28:19.865 --> 28:22.066
AND THE WHOLE TIME
SHE WAS SEEING HIM.

28:22.068 --> 28:26.003
WELL, ALI PLAYED A LOT
OF GAMES, MELISSA.

28:26.005 --> 28:27.905
THAT'S PROBABLY
WHAT GOT HER KILLED.

28:29.475 --> 28:33.911
¶ ASHES I LAID TO REST ¶

28:33.913 --> 28:37.915
¶ THEY STILL HAVE
SOME LIFE IN THEM ¶

28:37.917 --> 28:41.452
( song continues
over car stereo )

28:54.033 --> 28:55.699
( gasps )

28:55.701 --> 28:58.368
I WANT TO FINISH WHAT I STARTED
TO TELL YOU AT HOMECOMING.

29:08.314 --> 29:11.882
SEPTEMBER 1st IS THE DAY
I ENDED IT WITH JENNA.

29:11.884 --> 29:13.951
I FELT TERRIBLE
ABOUT WHAT WE WERE DOING,

29:13.953 --> 29:15.953
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW
HOW TO STOP IT.

29:15.955 --> 29:18.555
STAY THERE, OKAY?
PLEASE, IF YOU WANT
ME TO LISTEN,

29:18.557 --> 29:20.390
JUST STAY THERE.

29:20.392 --> 29:24.094
JENNA TOLD ME SHE'D
TELL PEOPLE THAT I FORCED
MYSELF ON HER.

29:24.096 --> 29:26.196
SHE DIDN'T WANT
IT TO STOP.

29:26.198 --> 29:29.066
JENNA WANTED
TO BE WITH YOU?

29:29.068 --> 29:31.201
JENNA WAS IN LOVE WITH ME.

29:33.372 --> 29:36.607
SHE'S STILL IN LOVE WITH ME.

29:36.609 --> 29:38.375
THANK YOU SO MUCH!
THAT'S SO SWEET.

29:38.377 --> 29:41.011
I SPECIFICALLY SAID
NO GIFTS, BUT LOOK AT THIS.

29:41.013 --> 29:42.880
THIS IS AMAZING.
I'M NOT GONNA SAY NO.

29:42.882 --> 29:46.850
OH, EXCUSE ME.
WELCOME TO CAMP MONA!

29:46.852 --> 29:48.418
HAPPY BIRTHDAY.

29:48.420 --> 29:50.687
OH, WHATEVER IT IS,
I'M SURE I'LL LOVE IT,

29:50.689 --> 29:52.156
AND IF NOT,
I'LL RETURN IT.

29:54.293 --> 29:56.460
SWAG!

29:56.462 --> 29:57.928
OH... THANKS.

29:57.930 --> 29:59.129
MM-HMM.

29:59.131 --> 30:01.899
OH, IT'S, UM... SUBTLE.

30:01.901 --> 30:03.934
OKAY, TOUR TIME.

30:03.936 --> 30:07.070
SO, OVER HERE, WE HAVE
THE MASSAGE TENT,

30:07.072 --> 30:10.073
THE MANI-PEDI AREA,
THE BLOW ME BAR,

30:10.075 --> 30:13.076
AND THE MINI BAR.

30:13.078 --> 30:16.446
( sighs ) EXCUSE ME.

30:16.448 --> 30:19.283
UM, DID I JUST SEE YOU
EAT A COOKIE?

30:21.520 --> 30:24.388
( scoffs )

30:24.390 --> 30:27.090
I ASKED ALISON TO MEET ME
SO I COULD TELL HER

30:27.092 --> 30:29.359
THAT SHE DID ME A FAVOR.

30:29.361 --> 30:31.228
SHE GOT ME AWAY
FROM JENNA.

30:31.230 --> 30:32.729
WHY WAS SHE
WEARING YOUR SWEATER,

30:32.731 --> 30:35.199
AND WHY WOULD ALI MEET
YOU AT THE KISSING ROCK?

30:35.201 --> 30:36.700
WE DIDN'T GO ANYWHERE.

30:36.702 --> 30:39.469
WE MET RIGHT OUTSIDE
OF SPENCER'S BARN.

30:39.471 --> 30:43.574
I GAVE HER MY SWEATER
BECAUSE IT WAS COLD.

30:43.576 --> 30:46.043
WHEN I LEFT HER,
SHE WAS GETTING IN THE CAR

30:46.045 --> 30:49.213
WITH SOME GUY,
STILL WEARING MY SWEATER.

30:49.215 --> 30:51.315
SHE WAS VERY MUCH ALIVE.

30:51.317 --> 30:52.816
YOU HAVE TO TELL
THE POLICE.

30:52.818 --> 30:54.484
YOU SEE HOW IT LOOKS.

30:54.486 --> 30:56.987
THEY'VE ALREADY
DECIDED I'M GUILTY.

30:56.989 --> 30:59.356
( chatter )

30:59.358 --> 31:00.891
IF I DON'T GO
TO THIS PARTY,

31:00.893 --> 31:02.759
MY FRIENDS ARE GONNA KNOW
THAT SOMETHING'S WRONG.

31:02.761 --> 31:05.162
I ONLY CAME BACK
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

31:05.164 --> 31:06.363
BACK FROM WHERE?

31:06.365 --> 31:08.599
I SPENT A YEAR
IN REFORM SCHOOL.

31:08.601 --> 31:11.668
I'VE GOT FRIENDS
IN ALL THE WRONG PLACES...

31:11.670 --> 31:14.504
AND MISERY LOVES COMPANY.

31:14.506 --> 31:16.173
YOU CAN'T KEEP RUNNING.

31:16.175 --> 31:18.842
I NEED TO GET AS FAR AWAY
FROM HERE AS I CAN NOW.

31:18.844 --> 31:20.043
BUT IF YOU'RE INNOCENT--

31:20.045 --> 31:22.479
IF? YOU THINK
I'M LYING?

31:25.117 --> 31:27.918
I NEED YOU TO BELIEVE
ME, EMILY.

31:27.920 --> 31:30.120
IT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

31:30.122 --> 31:32.122
BUT I STILL HAVE
SO MANY QUESTIONS.

31:32.124 --> 31:34.124
I LEFT MY STUFF
BEHIND THE CHURCH.

31:34.126 --> 31:35.993
IF THERE'S ANY WAY
YOU CAN COME,

31:35.995 --> 31:38.195
MY RIDE'S NOT PICKING
ME UP UNTIL MIDNIGHT.

31:41.767 --> 31:44.701
IF YOU TELL YOUR FRIENDS,
YOU KNOW THEY'LL CALL THE COPS.

31:51.677 --> 31:54.177
AND SO I SAID TO HER,
"IF YOU WERE INVITED,

31:54.179 --> 31:55.379
YOU WOULD'VE RECEIVED
AN INVITATION."

31:55.381 --> 31:57.047
CAN YOU BELIEVE THAT?

31:57.049 --> 31:59.716
HE CAME BACK TO TELL ME
THAT HE'S INNOCENT

31:59.718 --> 32:01.785
AND THAT HE DIDN'T HURT ALI.

32:01.787 --> 32:03.420
HE'S LYING.

32:03.422 --> 32:05.489
WE HAVE TO TELL
THE POLICE.

32:07.359 --> 32:09.893
( ringing )

32:09.895 --> 32:12.529
IT'S HANNA.

32:12.531 --> 32:14.031
HEY.

32:14.033 --> 32:15.132
HEY, HOW'S MY FRIEND MONA?

32:17.736 --> 32:20.904
UH... SHE'S MONA.

32:20.906 --> 32:22.739
<i> WELL, I'M LEAVING</i>
<i> IN TEN,</i>

32:22.741 --> 32:26.410
AND IF "A's" WATCHING YOU,
I'LL BE WATCHING HER.

32:26.412 --> 32:28.345
ARE YOU SURE
YOU'RE GONNA BE OKAY?

32:28.347 --> 32:30.314
ARIA, I WENT TO FAT CAMP
FOR FIVE SUMMERS.

32:30.316 --> 32:31.581
I CAN HANDLE
SOME WOODS.

32:31.583 --> 32:33.550
HANNA, LISTEN.

32:33.552 --> 32:34.918
EMILY SAW TOBY.

32:37.122 --> 32:38.689
HELLO?

32:38.691 --> 32:40.958
GOD, SERVICE
OUT HERE SUCKS.

32:43.128 --> 32:44.895
( ringing )

32:44.897 --> 32:46.096
IT'S FROM "A."

32:47.633 --> 32:49.032
"YOU FOUND MY BRACELET.

32:49.034 --> 32:51.335
NOW COME FIND ME.
GOOD LUCK, BITCHES."

32:51.337 --> 32:53.737
I THINK WE'RE SUPPOSED
TO GO TO WHERE WE FOUND
ALI'S BRACELET.

32:53.739 --> 32:55.439
THAT WAS IN THE MIDDLE
OF NOWHERE.

32:55.441 --> 32:58.942
ACTUALLY, IT WAS 15 STEPS
EAST OF THE HALF-POINT TREE,

32:58.944 --> 33:01.912
WHICH IS 136 STEPS
FROM THE MAIN ROAD.

33:01.914 --> 33:05.148
YOU'RE A FREAK,
AND I LOVE YOU.

33:05.150 --> 33:07.818
EMILY, ARIA!
YOUR TURN TO GET BLOWN.

33:11.290 --> 33:13.991
WELL, IT HAS TO LOOK LIKE
WE'RE HERE FOR THE PARTY,

33:13.993 --> 33:16.460
SO, GO GLAMP, AND I'LL BE
BACK BEFORE IT GETS DARK.

33:17.997 --> 33:19.930
( ringing )

33:21.333 --> 33:22.399
IS IT "A"?

33:24.103 --> 33:25.635
NO. UH, JUST MY MOM.

33:55.634 --> 33:58.001
WOW.

33:58.003 --> 33:59.870
SHUT UP.

33:59.872 --> 34:01.872
WHAT HAPPENS
IF YOU TOUCH IT?

34:01.874 --> 34:03.340
( chuckles )

34:03.342 --> 34:04.841
DID YOU FIND ANYTHING?

34:04.843 --> 34:07.477
( clears throat )

34:07.479 --> 34:08.311
COME HERE.

34:13.752 --> 34:16.019
GUYS, CHECK IT OUT.

34:19.124 --> 34:20.857
IS JENNA TELLING US
THAT SHE'S "A"?

34:20.859 --> 34:23.827
I DON'T THINK SO.
THERE'S SOMETHING ELSE.

34:23.829 --> 34:26.863
"YOU'RE AS IN THE DARK
AS JENNA,

34:26.865 --> 34:28.398
LOOKING FOR ME IN ALL
THE WRONG PLACES."

34:29.802 --> 34:31.401
WELL, IF THIS IS
THE WRONG PLACE,

34:31.403 --> 34:32.369
THEN WHAT'S
THE RIGHT PLACE?

34:46.518 --> 34:49.753
( knocks )
HEY.

34:49.755 --> 34:52.923
JUST WALKING HOME.
MAYBE YOU COULD GIVE ME A LIFT.

34:52.925 --> 34:54.858
I'M NOT GOING HOME.

34:54.860 --> 34:56.293
I-I'M LATE.

35:13.245 --> 35:15.712
¶ YOU'RE ALWAYS BOUND
TO FALL ¶

35:17.850 --> 35:21.885
¶ THERE'S NOTHING
YOU CAN DO ¶

35:25.324 --> 35:31.128
¶ THE WEIGHT
OF GRAVITY BEGINS ¶

35:31.130 --> 35:35.098
¶ TO PULL YOU DOWN AGAIN ¶

35:37.202 --> 35:40.504
¶ SO WHAT ARE YOU
TO DO NOW ¶

35:40.506 --> 35:42.639
( siren wails )

35:42.641 --> 35:47.544
¶ STUCK BETWEEN THE HOPE
AND DOUBT ¶

35:49.848 --> 35:55.418
¶ YOU GET SO CLOSE
TO CLARITY ¶

35:55.420 --> 35:59.356
¶ MAKES YOU QUESTION
EVERYTHING ¶

36:01.994 --> 36:06.296
¶ YOU'RE SO FAR AWAY ¶

36:06.298 --> 36:09.833
¶ SO FAR AWAY FROM ME ¶

36:27.085 --> 36:30.287
"YOU'RE LOOKING FOR ME
IN ALL THE WRONG PLACES."

36:32.291 --> 36:34.658
"LOOKING FOR ME
IN ALL THE WRONG PLACES."

36:42.668 --> 36:43.700
HERE.

36:59.985 --> 37:02.419
HEY, WHERE'S ARIA?

37:02.421 --> 37:03.787
I DON'T KNOW.

37:03.789 --> 37:05.822
WE HAVE TO GO
TO THE WRIGHT PLACE.

37:05.824 --> 37:08.425
W-R-I-G-H-T.

37:10.829 --> 37:11.995
WRIGHT'S PLAYGROUND!

37:29.781 --> 37:31.615
( sighs )

37:47.899 --> 37:50.267
Emily: I THINK YOU'RE
ACTUALLY ENJOYING THIS.

38:07.653 --> 38:09.519
( chain squeaks )

38:34.946 --> 38:37.314
Ezra: THANKS
FOR MEETING ME.

38:37.316 --> 38:39.282
( clears throat )

38:42.888 --> 38:46.222
I DON'T BLAME YOU
FOR BEING ANGRY.

38:46.224 --> 38:48.491
I DESERVE IT.

38:48.493 --> 38:51.161
I WAS A COWARD.

38:51.163 --> 38:53.596
I SHOULD'VE FOUGHT
FOR YOU.

38:53.598 --> 38:55.165
YEAH? WHY DIDN'T YOU?

38:57.436 --> 39:00.437
I WAS LOOKING FOR ANOTHER JOB
SO I COULD LEAVE YOU, ARIA.

39:00.439 --> 39:03.273
I WAS... LOOKING
FOR YOU.

39:03.275 --> 39:05.008
I THOUGHT THAT
IF I RESIGNED

39:05.010 --> 39:07.310
FROM ROSEWOOD,
WE'D HAVE A CHANCE.

39:09.448 --> 39:12.182
THEN I SAW YOU
WITH NOEL.

39:12.184 --> 39:15.018
( chuckles )
AND...

39:15.020 --> 39:17.253
I DECIDED I WAS
BEING SELFISH,

39:17.255 --> 39:19.489
AND IF YOU HAD
A CHANCE OF BEING HAPPY

39:19.491 --> 39:20.990
WITHOUT ALL
THE COMPLICATIONS...

39:20.992 --> 39:23.226
YOU REALLY ARE
A JERK, EZRA.

39:23.228 --> 39:25.862
( scoffs ) YOU CAN'T
JUST GO AROUND DECIDING

39:25.864 --> 39:28.298
HOW THINGS ARE
SUPPOSED TO WORK OUT.

39:28.300 --> 39:31.868
I MEAN, YOU DON'T GET
TO CHOOSE HOW I FEEL.

39:31.870 --> 39:35.071
LOOK, WHETHER YOU
BELIEVE ME OR NOT,

39:35.073 --> 39:37.407
I HAVE ALWAYS
BEEN HONEST WITH YOU.

39:37.409 --> 39:39.676
BUT YOU HIDING YOUR FEELINGS
FROM ME IS JUST LIKE LYING.

39:45.050 --> 39:47.250
I WAS WRONG.

39:51.390 --> 39:52.789
FORGIVE ME.

39:54.926 --> 39:56.459
NO.

40:00.265 --> 40:01.965
Forgive me.

41:46.505 --> 41:48.037

41:50.509 --> 41:52.175

41:54.446 --> 41:55.578

42:00.919 --> 42:02.852

42:15.934 --> 42:19.702

42:19.704 --> 42:21.671

42:40.525 --> 42:41.558

42:41.560 --> 42:43.326

42:43.328 --> 42:44.594
