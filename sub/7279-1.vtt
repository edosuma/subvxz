But taking the Alamo
changed everything.

under the Federalist
Constitution of 1824.

Santa Anna tore
that document up
personally, did he not?

07:00.128 --> 07:02.589
Named himself
supreme dictator?

07:02.589 --> 07:05.884
Well, I, for one,
ain't swearin' allegiance

of the army if they
won't listen to me?

07:49.261 --> 07:51.263
We need to muster
and train troops here,

07:51.263 --> 07:54.224
not send soldiers
all over Texas.

07:54.224 --> 07:56.435
Idiots. They think
Santa Anna's just gonna

Mexico without a fight?

want you humble,

08:05.235 --> 08:08.947
I humble myself before God,
and there the list ends.

08:08.947 --> 08:13.327
To march an
expedition between
here and Matamoros

is lunacy!

08:16.079 --> 08:18.874

into vagabond militias

the slightest pretext
like bloodthirsty rabble.

Do you really
believe this war is over?

08:26.381 --> 08:29.552
You opposed Bexar,
but victory was ours!

08:29.552 --> 08:31.053
MEN: Yeah!

08:31.053 --> 08:33.847
And now you oppose
Matamoros, where victory
will be as sweet.

08:33.847 --> 08:35.349
No.

08:35.349 --> 08:37.225
Perhaps, sir, you simply
oppose fighting.

Fighters shall
lead the new country
of Texas, sir.

08:39.729 --> 08:42.438

consider the removal
of General Houston

Any excuse to start
removin' your clothes,
is that right, Houston?

09:15.097 --> 09:16.765
This is not your
concern, Mr. Bowie.

09:16.765 --> 09:19.935
Indeed. This is between me
and the Scottish catamite.

09:23.188 --> 09:25.650
Wanna borrow mine, Grant?

give it to ya.

like the uniform sent?

10:17.367 --> 10:19.286
San Antonio de Bexar.

10:19.286 --> 10:21.288
I'll be there
defending the Alamo.

10:22.622 --> 10:24.624
Defend against what?

10:24.624 --> 10:27.169
The Mexican army
left there with their
tail between their legs.

11:14.633 --> 11:18.804

are abandonment, adultery,

11:18.804 --> 11:20.931
or cruel and
barbarous treatment.

11:20.931 --> 11:23.934
I think
abandonment's most accurate.

11:23.934 --> 11:26.603
Any of the choices
would be appropriate.

11:48.875 --> 11:51.044
You sure
you want to do this?

11:53.338 --> 11:55.841
Well, we-we signed the papers.

this harshly,

example in his life.

arrangements for him

12:05.559 --> 12:07.894

family while I'm away.

12:10.021 --> 12:12.983
Well, we have a
long way to travel.

out in the open.

there ain't no slaves, right?

01:06:24.773 --> 01:06:26.983
Yeah.
And contract or no,
that's what you is.

01:06:28.194 --> 01:06:29.736
Now, the Mexicans
see your color,

01:06:29.736 --> 01:06:32.239

They pass you by.

01:06:32.239 --> 01:06:34.449
But Mr. William,
he gonna give me a gun,
and I'll...

30 men from here in Gonzales
have already
left for the Alamo.

01:07:01.309 --> 01:07:03.062
Assemble the men
that we have.

01:07:13.989 --> 01:07:15.365
HOUSTON:
We need more men.

01:07:17.118 --> 01:07:20.287
If they arrive every day,
soon we will have enough.

01:07:20.287 --> 01:07:21.329
But for now, we wait.

01:07:22.831 --> 01:07:25.500
If we can't run, we walk.
If we can't walk, we crawl.

01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:28.712
But we gotta go to
the aid of those boys.
It's only right.

01:07:28.712 --> 01:07:31.006
General, I'm the man
who left Travis there.

01:07:31.006 --> 01:07:34.050
I do not enjoy waiting
any more than the next man,

01:07:34.050 --> 01:07:36.344
but I will not
sacrifice Texas.

01:07:38.096 --> 01:07:42.100
These 124 men cannot pierce
an army of thousands.

01:07:44.186 --> 01:07:47.439
Colonel Fannin is
en route from Goliad
with 400 men.

01:07:47.439 --> 01:07:50.066
These troops need training.
I suggest that you
commence with it.

01:07:51.067 --> 01:07:52.903
What should I tell Travis?

01:07:52.903 --> 01:07:54.488
Nothing.
You're staying here.

01:07:54.488 --> 01:07:57.449
No. General... Sam.
I gave my word!

01:07:57.449 --> 01:07:59.201
That's an order.

01:08:07.542 --> 01:08:10.212
Good work, boys.

01:08:10.212 --> 01:08:13.089
Always good to have
a fall-back position.

ain't it, Cap?

01:08:24.975 --> 01:08:27.103
I'm reassigning you

01:08:27.103 --> 01:08:29.648
to the battery at
the rear of the church

01:08:29.648 --> 01:08:33.319
so you can be
near your families.

01:08:33.319 --> 01:08:36.279
And I've arranged
for a replacement
for your midnight watch.

01:08:37.238 --> 01:08:38.657
Thank you, sir.

01:08:49.251 --> 01:08:50.961
Gracias.

01:08:56.258 --> 01:08:57.466
Here you go, son.

01:09:01.263 --> 01:09:03.180
So, Davy,

01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:07.602
in all your Indian fightin',
you ever get into
a scrape like this?

01:09:07.602 --> 01:09:11.564
I was never in
but one real scrape
in my life, feller.

01:09:11.564 --> 01:09:14.024
Yeah, but you was in
the Red Stick War.

01:09:14.024 --> 01:09:16.528
Yeah, it's true.
I was in that.

01:09:16.528 --> 01:09:17.988
I sure was.

01:09:20.323 --> 01:09:22.951
I was just about your
age when it broke out.

01:09:24.868 --> 01:09:30.332
The Creeks boxed up
about 400 or 500
people at Fort Mims

01:09:30.332 --> 01:09:33.587
and massacred
every one of 'em.

01:09:33.587 --> 01:09:35.671
Of course, this was
big news around those parts,

01:09:35.671 --> 01:09:38.133
so I up and joined
the volunteers.

01:09:38.133 --> 01:09:41.176
I did a little scoutin',
but mostly...

01:09:41.176 --> 01:09:44.805
I just fetched in
venison for the cookfire,
things of that nature.

01:09:47.183 --> 01:09:53.732
Well, we caught up
with those redskins
at Tallushatchee,

01:09:53.732 --> 01:09:58.069
surrounded the village,
come in from all directions.

01:09:58.069 --> 01:10:00.989
Wasn't much of a fight,
really.

01:10:00.989 --> 01:10:02.741
We just shot 'em
down like dogs.

01:10:04.701 --> 01:10:06.119
Finally...

01:10:08.247 --> 01:10:12.042
what Injuns was left,
they crowded into
this little cabin.

01:10:12.917 --> 01:10:14.919
They wanted to surrender.

01:10:17.547 --> 01:10:21.676
But this squaw,
she loosed an arrow
and killed one of the fellers,

01:10:23.387 --> 01:10:24.346
and then we shot her.

01:10:28.434 --> 01:10:30.435
And then we set
the cabin on fire.

01:10:33.439 --> 01:10:35.565
We could hear 'em screamin'
for their gods in there.

01:10:38.318 --> 01:10:39.569
We smelled 'em burnin'.

01:10:42.989 --> 01:10:47.285
We'd had nary to eat
but parched
corn since October.

01:10:47.285 --> 01:10:51.456
And the next day,
when we dug through the ashes,

01:10:51.456 --> 01:10:54.084
we found some potaters
from the cellar.

01:10:57.296 --> 01:11:01.342
They'd been
cooked by that grease
that run off them Indians.

01:11:04.135 --> 01:11:06.179
And we ate till
we nearly burst.

01:11:14.437 --> 01:11:16.064
Since then...

01:11:18.108 --> 01:11:22.028
you pass the taters,
I'll pass 'em right back.

01:11:37.085 --> 01:11:39.629
He's been stabbed three times,

01:11:39.629 --> 01:11:41.840
once through the lungs,

01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:44.467
shot two or three times.

he has been sent.

I don't know

My time in Washington,

01:20:21.025 --> 01:20:23.611
the fellas in Congress
made a good deal
of sport of me.

01:20:24.820 --> 01:20:26.447
I learned
an awful lot from 'em.

01:20:27.823 --> 01:20:31.619
Learned how to dress,
to a certain degree,

01:20:31.619 --> 01:20:34.998
what fork to use
in polite company,
things like that.

01:20:36.123 --> 01:20:38.918
I was never afraid to
stretch things a bit.

been through an awful lot.

that they've earned
the right to hear the truth.

politicians and generals,

a second chance for me.

ask each of you

01:22:36.994 --> 01:22:38.996
what it is you value so highly

01:22:40.247 --> 01:22:45.002
that you are willing to
fight and possibly die for.

01:22:48.798 --> 01:22:50.883

hopes to lure us into
attempting escape.

better than remaining
in this place, penned up.

lf, however,
we force the enemy to attack,

01:23:11.320 --> 01:23:14.115
I believe every one of you
will prove himself
worth ten in return.

01:23:16.742 --> 01:23:21.497
We will not
only show the world
what patriots are made of,

01:23:21.497 --> 01:23:24.917
but we will also
deal a crippling blow
to the army of Santa Anna.

stay here, with me,

you out with an escort.

given your condition,

01:26:05.995 --> 01:26:08.163

01:26:08.163 --> 01:26:09.456

01:56:47.543 --> 01:56:50.088
20-odd years ago,

01:56:50.088 --> 01:56:53.382
Napoleon returns
from exile in Elba,

01:56:53.382 --> 01:56:56.969
puts together an army
and moves east, swiftly,

01:56:58.345 --> 01:57:01.056
before an alliance
of nations can occur.

01:57:03.267 --> 01:57:05.269
Wellington,

01:57:05.269 --> 01:57:08.647
with fewer men,
fewer armaments,

01:57:08.647 --> 01:57:10.899
stays one step
ahead of the French,

01:57:10.899 --> 01:57:12.901
teasing them
with his presence,

01:57:12.901 --> 01:57:16.530
knowing that a large army
will have to splinter
to keep up.

01:57:16.530 --> 01:57:18.949
He moves and waits.

01:57:18.949 --> 01:57:22.411
Moves and waits
for Napoleon to
make a mistake,

01:57:22.411 --> 01:57:26.290
to fall into a scenario
that condemns him to defeat.

01:57:26.290 --> 01:57:30.377
Wellington chooses
the setting for victory

01:57:30.377 --> 01:57:33.214
before it exists for him,
before he lays eyes on it.

01:57:34.173 --> 01:57:36.717
It has an open battleground,

01:57:37.134 --> 01:57:39.344
a sloping plain,

01:57:39.344 --> 01:57:41.430
cover for encampment

01:57:41.430 --> 01:57:44.141
and an opportunity
to flank the enemy.

01:57:49.188 --> 01:57:52.691
The Mexican army
is splintered,

01:57:52.691 --> 01:57:54.067
and though they
do not know it,

01:57:54.067 --> 01:57:58.113
Santa Anna's troops
subsist on gasps of
air and sips of hope.

01:57:59.948 --> 01:58:02.285
I share Wellington's
battleground vision,

01:58:02.285 --> 01:58:05.704
though I do not know
the name of
the place that I imagine.

01:58:07.748 --> 01:58:11.543
I, sir, do not consider
myself Wellington.

01:58:11.543 --> 01:58:14.129
Santa Anna, however,
does consider himself

01:58:14.129 --> 01:58:16.548
to be the Napoleon
of the West.

01:58:18.259 --> 01:58:22.221
We shall move and wait
until he makes a mistake

01:58:24.014 --> 01:58:26.517
and presents us
with his own Waterloo.

01:58:28.435 --> 01:58:32.273
(DISTANT SHOUTING
OF ORDERS IN SPANISH)

01:58:35.067 --> 01:58:37.361
Stay back, everybody.
Stay back.

01:58:37.361 --> 01:58:39.238
SEGUIN:
Bring him here.

01:58:41.406 --> 01:58:43.325
Water!

01:58:43.325 --> 01:58:45.244
Tranquilo. Tranquilo.

01:58:45.244 --> 01:58:46.245
Water!

01:58:46.245 --> 01:58:48.121
Escucha. Escucha.

01:58:52.793 --> 01:58:55.254
Deaf captured
a Mexican courier.

01:58:55.254 --> 01:58:57.339
His letters tell us
that Santa Anna's nearby

01:58:57.339 --> 01:58:59.299
and separated from
the rest of his army.

01:59:16.066 --> 01:59:17.359
General...

01:59:18.860 --> 01:59:21.364
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

01:59:28.287 --> 01:59:30.414
(REPLIES IN SPANISH)

(REPLIES IN SPANISH)

01:59:55.314 --> 01:59:57.190
(FAINT VOICES)

01:59:57.190 --> 01:59:59.860
Left! Left, march!

02:00:05.616 --> 02:00:07.075
Attention!

02:00:17.878 --> 02:00:19.713
Back to back. Stay sharp.

02:00:24.718 --> 02:00:26.219
MAN: Bayonets!

02:00:27.179 --> 02:00:28.388
Ready!

02:00:29.222 --> 02:00:30.557
March!

02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:36.563
March!

02:01:13.809 --> 02:01:15.352
Do you have a name?

02:01:26.947 --> 02:01:29.408
There is a bridge
behind the Mexican line.

02:01:30.909 --> 02:01:33.412
Send Deaf Smith and
his men to burn it.

02:01:35.747 --> 02:01:37.416
Captain Seguin.

02:01:43.338 --> 02:01:47.300
You and your men
shall guard the camp.

02:01:47.300 --> 02:01:49.511
There could be
confusion out there.

02:01:49.511 --> 02:01:51.304
Men shooting any
Mexican they see.

02:01:51.304 --> 02:01:55.016
General,
you ordered me to stay,
and I stayed.

02:01:56.394 --> 02:01:58.353
But this is our fight, too.

02:02:00.647 --> 02:02:03.401
You shall join Sherman
on the left flank.

02:02:13.493 --> 02:02:14.619
MAN: Two blades per man!

02:02:25.505 --> 02:02:27.507
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

02:02:35.098 --> 02:02:37.809
MAN: Company, shoulder arms!

02:02:59.623 --> 02:03:02.501
You will remember
this battle,

02:03:02.501 --> 02:03:04.669
remember each minute of it,

02:03:05.670 --> 02:03:07.714
each second,

02:03:07.714 --> 02:03:10.717
till the day that you die.

02:03:10.717 --> 02:03:13.471
But that is for
tomorrow, gentlemen!

02:03:14.054 --> 02:03:15.388
For today,

02:03:16.473 --> 02:03:17.974
remember the Alamo!

02:03:19.351 --> 02:03:21.394
The hour is at hand!

02:03:21.394 --> 02:03:23.230
(MEN CHEERING)

02:03:23.230 --> 02:03:24.482
Form ranks!

02:03:38.537 --> 02:03:40.413
Battalion, halt!

02:03:43.124 --> 02:03:44.376
Fire!

02:03:50.298 --> 02:03:51.383
Fire!

02:03:55.053 --> 02:03:56.137
March!

02:04:00.934 --> 02:04:02.603
Remember the Alamo!

02:04:17.450 --> 02:04:18.952
Forward guns! Fight!

02:04:35.468 --> 02:04:37.596
SOLDIER:
Remember the Alamo!

02:04:37.596 --> 02:04:39.639
(MAN SHOUTS IN SPANISH)

02:05:06.416 --> 02:05:08.793
MAN: Dig the plot, boys.
Kill them all!

02:05:14.674 --> 02:05:16.552
(ALL SHOUTING)

02:06:49.769 --> 02:06:51.479
Let's kill him and
be done with it.

02:06:51.479 --> 02:06:52.815
MEN: Yeah!

02:06:52.815 --> 02:06:55.608
I say we hang him
from this very tree.

02:06:55.608 --> 02:06:57.736
MEN: Yeah! Hang him!

02:06:57.736 --> 02:06:59.320
MAN: Hang him!

02:07:00.238 --> 02:07:01.364
No.

02:07:02.407 --> 02:07:03.533
You'll settle for blood.

02:07:07.287 --> 02:07:08.789
I want Texas.
