Oh, no!

Yes!

from the warlocks.

00:28.696 --> 00:31.599

00:31.699 --> 00:33.767

Mr. Smith,

01:12.773 --> 01:15.643

the best dungeon master around.

01:15.743 --> 01:19.780

Dude, she is into you!

01:27.755 --> 01:29.690

This is not a game.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.259
Baseball is a game.

01:31.359 --> 01:33.127

01:47.241 --> 01:49.610

01:49.710 --> 01:50.978
No.

too crestfallen for love.

01:53.547 --> 01:54.948

01:55.048 --> 01:57.485
