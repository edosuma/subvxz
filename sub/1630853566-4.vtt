the relegation match.

many turrets were on that map."

he was being a fucking idiot,

09:51.329 --> 09:54.115
I want a chalupa
from Taco Bell Cantina.

09:54.158 --> 09:55.638
And the closest one
is in Las Vegas.

09:55.682 --> 09:58.075
So I'm like, "This guy,
if he really wants to show me,

09:58.119 --> 09:59.686
"he's gonna have
to pull out his phone,

09:59.729 --> 10:03.515
pay some Postmates guy
to drive from Las Vegas."

10:03.559 --> 10:07.650
Nathan looks me in the eyes,
he says, "Come with me."

10:07.694 --> 10:09.739
NATHAN: This is how you guys
should be getting around.

10:09.783 --> 10:11.741
-Holy shit, bro.
-This is it.

10:11.785 --> 10:13.134
-Enjoy. Step in, step in.
-Oh, my God.

10:13.177 --> 10:16.137
CREAMCHEESE:
He drives us to a fucking hangar

10:16.180 --> 10:19.053
and puts us on a private jet
to Las Vegas.

10:19.096 --> 10:23.013
GURU: Oh, my God,
I can't believe we're here!

10:23.057 --> 10:24.275
FORESITE:
If you've been eating Taco Bell

10:24.319 --> 10:25.973
your whole life, thinking,

10:26.016 --> 10:27.714
"This is as good as it gets,"

10:27.757 --> 10:30.194
you've obviously never been

10:30.238 --> 10:31.935
-to a Taco Bell Cantina.
-CREAMCHEESE: Guys, is this--

10:31.979 --> 10:34.590
This is beautiful right?
Like, this is art.

10:34.634 --> 10:38.420
It is a non-negligible step up
from regular Taco Bell.

10:38.463 --> 10:40.988
PAUL: Th-There's alcoholic
slush things, there's a DJ.

10:41.031 --> 10:43.904
There's cool lights, it's very
clean, the food is really good.

10:43.947 --> 10:45.253
There are often bachelor

10:45.296 --> 10:47.429
and bachelorette parties
at the same time.

10:47.472 --> 10:50.519
FRUGGER: Taco Bell Cantina is
like Taco Bell after dark.

10:50.562 --> 10:52.086
Like, it's-it's not,
like, a strip club

10:52.129 --> 10:55.393
or anything, right,
but it's... it's close.

10:55.437 --> 10:56.786
APRIL:
As soon as we got back

10:56.830 --> 10:58.266
from Vegas,
he wanted to show them

10:58.309 --> 10:59.746
the new living arrangements.

10:59.789 --> 11:01.399
-This is it.

11:01.443 --> 11:03.184
CREAMCHEESE:
I could get used to this.

11:03.227 --> 11:04.576
He'd put us in this house
that had the resources

11:04.620 --> 11:06.709
that we needed to level up.

11:06.753 --> 11:09.016
FORESITE:
Scrim rooms, war room,

11:09.059 --> 11:11.714
coach's office,
our own bathrooms?

11:11.758 --> 11:13.716
APRIL: On top of the perks,
Nathan was offering

11:13.760 --> 11:15.718
six-figure salaries
for the players and me.

11:15.762 --> 11:17.459
CREAMCHEESE:
It, like, looks-- it looks--

11:17.502 --> 11:18.721
the sky looks nicer here.

11:18.765 --> 11:20.288
I remember, at the time,

11:20.331 --> 11:23.204
April and Braxton were wary.

11:23.247 --> 11:26.381
And I think Guru
was especially wary.

11:26.424 --> 11:27.643
Looking back,
that was the beginning

11:27.687 --> 11:30.385
of the end with Guru, you know?

11:30.428 --> 11:34.389
I haven't spoken to him
in two, three years,

11:34.432 --> 11:37.827
and I think
that's the main reason why.

11:37.871 --> 11:40.090
We are worth so much more.

11:40.134 --> 11:42.397
Why would you take
the first offer, is my point.

11:42.440 --> 11:44.878
And-and Cream
and fucking, uh, Foresite,

11:44.921 --> 11:47.750
they're just ready to take,
they're ready to sell now.

11:47.794 --> 11:50.100
APRIL:
I rarely agree with Guru,

11:50.144 --> 11:53.060
but I was looking at Nathan
rolling out the red carpet

11:53.103 --> 11:56.759
and I realized
we could have been worth...

11:56.803 --> 12:00.154
12, 15, 20 times that
in a few years.

12:00.197 --> 12:01.982
We didn't know
what the ceiling could be.

12:02.025 --> 12:04.811
Money aside, this was our team.

12:04.854 --> 12:07.378
We built it from nothing,

12:07.422 --> 12:10.686
and-and Nathan just didn't
have anything to do with that.

12:10.730 --> 12:14.298
CREAMCHEESE: Kyle and April and
Guru, they weren't as impressed

12:14.342 --> 12:15.909
by the glitz and the glam.

12:15.952 --> 12:18.215
April doesn't even like
Mexican food that much.

12:18.259 --> 12:22.959
PuttPutt to a lesser degree, but
Foresite really wanted the cash.

12:23.003 --> 12:24.395
And I wanted to go
where Foresite was.

12:24.439 --> 12:26.571
FORESITE:
I wanted to win NA.

12:26.615 --> 12:28.878
I wanted to win Worlds.

12:28.922 --> 12:31.489
And when Nathan's
offer came through,

12:31.533 --> 12:34.057
if we didn't take it,
I felt like it meant

12:34.101 --> 12:36.103
that we didn't want to win.

12:36.146 --> 12:39.584
It was clear he was saying,

12:39.628 --> 12:42.196
"If we don't sell,
I'm gonna leave."

12:42.239 --> 12:44.372
And I wasn't
gonna let that happen.

12:44.415 --> 12:45.982
I-I-- We were the Axe Bros.

12:46.026 --> 12:47.505
A-And I didn't really see

12:47.549 --> 12:49.203
the downside either.

12:49.246 --> 12:50.900
The team was pretty split.

12:50.944 --> 12:52.684
And they did,

12:52.728 --> 12:55.426
in retrospect,
the most ridiculous thing

12:55.470 --> 12:58.473
to decide whether to run
the team on their own

12:58.516 --> 13:01.171
or take the payout
from Nathan Resnick,

13:01.215 --> 13:03.391
and they played

13:03.434 --> 13:06.089
a game of Mundo Dodgeball.

13:06.133 --> 13:09.571
And they recorded it
and they posted it to YouTube.

13:11.791 --> 13:14.576
GURU: It's a tie vote to decide
whether we completely bitch out,

13:14.619 --> 13:15.838
-sell the team, or we man up.
-I haven't watched this video

13:15.882 --> 13:17.231
in, like, three years.

13:17.274 --> 13:18.101
It's all gonna come down
to one game

13:18.145 --> 13:19.537
of Mundo Dodgeball.

13:19.581 --> 13:22.410
-We're bitching out.
-Foresite versus Braxton.

13:22.453 --> 13:23.846
Let's go.

13:23.890 --> 13:25.630
Mundo Dodgeball is simple.

13:25.674 --> 13:27.850
Two Mundos enter the Baron pit,

13:27.894 --> 13:31.985
no items, one ability,
you dodge or you die.

13:32.028 --> 13:33.987
I mean, if you want
to decide, like,

13:34.030 --> 13:36.816
who's paying for the pizza,
you play Mundo Dodgeball.

13:36.859 --> 13:38.600
You don't play Mundo Dodgeball

13:38.643 --> 13:40.907

To me, that video is just

13:49.045 --> 13:51.874

for where esports went,

13:51.918 --> 13:53.223

13:53.267 --> 13:55.747

13:55.791 --> 13:58.794

13:58.838 --> 14:00.491

where it started.

14:00.535 --> 14:02.624
-Axe Bros, baby.
-GABRIELLA: I don't think

14:02.667 --> 14:04.800
we're ever gonna see
anything like that ever again.

14:04.844 --> 14:06.976
This is a million-dollar game
right here.

14:07.020 --> 14:08.586
-This is a million-dollar game.
-You win this,

14:08.630 --> 14:10.327
you get a million dollars.

14:10.371 --> 14:12.852
Based on the valuation
of the team now,

14:12.895 --> 14:15.158
it turned out to be a lot more

14:15.202 --> 14:18.248

In the meantime, Liberty Green
Group is not interested

18:56.178 --> 18:58.615
in our operations,
so they have asked me

18:58.659 --> 19:00.965
to take over all
Fugitive Gaming activities...

19:01.009 --> 19:02.358
CREAMCHEESE:
April.

19:02.402 --> 19:04.186
-...for a couple months...
-Oh, my God.

19:04.230 --> 19:05.579
-...until they find a buyer.
-Oh, my God.

19:05.622 --> 19:08.451
Boss April. Nathan: gone, right?

19:08.495 --> 19:10.497
Fuck yeah,
are you kidding me, dude?

19:10.540 --> 19:12.499
Ugh! This is fucking incredible.
This is the best news

19:12.542 --> 19:14.327
-I've ever heard.
-We're gonna have new owners.

19:14.370 --> 19:16.155
-We've got our team back.
-They're gonna step in.

19:16.198 --> 19:17.591
-Cream, it's a temporary thing.
-It's not forever, dude.

19:17.634 --> 19:19.332
CREAMCHEESE:
This is fucking incredible.

19:19.375 --> 19:21.160
-Nightfall, you got a question?
-Yeah. Does that mean

19:21.203 --> 19:23.118
-I can drive the team truck?
-PAUL: No.

19:23.162 --> 19:25.033
Yes. You can drive
the team truck.

19:25.076 --> 19:26.991
-It's our team now.
-APRIL: They're gonna step in.

19:27.035 --> 19:28.428
They're gonna do what they want.

19:28.471 --> 19:29.907
-Did you text me? What's up?
-Dude. Yes.

19:29.951 --> 19:31.344
I-I have the best
fucking news for you.

19:31.387 --> 19:32.823
Please tell me
I'm back on the team.

19:32.867 --> 19:34.434
You're back
on the fucking team.

19:34.477 --> 19:37.045
-Is he ri-- is he serious?
-KYLE: Hey! Hey!

19:37.088 --> 19:38.481
-FRUGGER: Is he serious?
-We have the old team back.

19:38.525 --> 19:40.309
-Bro, this is incredible.
-Is he serious?

19:40.353 --> 19:42.137
APRIL: We cannot answer
these questions right now.

19:42.181 --> 19:43.921
-Why can't we do this? What?
-Cream!

19:43.965 --> 19:46.010
Can we discuss
strategy later, please?

19:46.054 --> 19:49.144
Discuss strategy? Dude, we're--
This is incredible.

19:49.188 --> 19:50.841
-Cream, for the love of God...
-We get-- Organizm's out,

19:50.885 --> 19:52.321
-and Frugger gets to be back in.
-Later! Later!

19:52.365 --> 19:54.105
-KYLE: Thank you.
-APRIL: Have a seat.

19:54.149 --> 19:56.107
CREAMCHEESE:
No offense to Organizm, but...

19:56.151 --> 19:57.979
it just didn't work out
and he was terrible

19:58.022 --> 19:59.459
and he won't be missed.

19:59.502 --> 20:02.070
This is the best day
of my life.

20:02.113 --> 20:03.941
-[exhales]
-This feels right.

20:03.985 --> 20:06.553
This is what-- Org would
never do this with me.

20:06.596 --> 20:08.772
This is how
it was supposed to be.

20:08.816 --> 20:10.731
PAUL: I-I think we should
hold back on hugs a little bit,

20:10.774 --> 20:13.821
because there's th-- there's
just a lot that's up in the air.

20:13.864 --> 20:15.779
-We can't hug now, Paul?
-I...

20:15.823 --> 20:18.260
Hug police, right?

20:18.304 --> 20:21.263
It's 'cause his parents
didn't hug him.

20:21.307 --> 20:22.743
I heard your girlfriend
dumped you on the phone

20:22.786 --> 20:23.961
-the other day, by the way.
-I don't...

20:24.005 --> 20:25.441
That shit was sad.
[chuckles]

20:25.485 --> 20:27.704
-It was a...
-That shit was fucking sad.

20:27.748 --> 20:29.619
Yeah, it was.

20:31.926 --> 20:34.058
KYLE:
[sighs] It's a tough situation.

20:34.102 --> 20:35.799
PAUL:
Yep.

20:35.843 --> 20:38.411
What do the guys think
for this weekend?

20:38.454 --> 20:39.803
They want Frugger.

20:39.847 --> 20:41.892
-I-- You know, I...
-Yeah.

20:41.936 --> 20:44.895
Nightfall says, um, start
scrimming Frugger Monday,

20:44.939 --> 20:47.507
-play Org tomorrow.
-That makes sense.

20:47.550 --> 20:49.596
-Yeah.
-I think I agree with him,

20:49.639 --> 20:52.251
if the MSS wasn't on the line,
if it wasn't 100 Thieves.

20:52.294 --> 20:54.253
We'll throw Frugger in
tomorrow, but...

20:54.296 --> 20:56.472
Well, that's the thing,
it's a huge game.

20:56.516 --> 21:00.346
-Creamcheese is gonna hate this.
-[chuckles] Yeah.

21:00.389 --> 21:03.523
He's gonna say a bunch
of really mean stuff to me.

21:03.566 --> 21:05.568
[chuckles]

21:05.612 --> 21:10.051
And I guess that's just
how that's gonna go.

21:10.094 --> 21:12.140
Yeah.

21:12.183 --> 21:14.621
He'll be like,
"You fucking idiot,

21:14.664 --> 21:16.579
-and stupid-stupid..."
-What was that?

21:16.623 --> 21:19.756
Uh, just, like, he would say,
like, "You're fucking stupid."

21:19.800 --> 21:21.192
-Uh, yeah, probably yeah.
-Yeah.

21:21.236 --> 21:22.890
Something like that.

21:22.933 --> 21:24.326
Dude, I-I mean,
this is-- I think

21:24.370 --> 21:25.762
this is a fucking terrible play.

21:25.806 --> 21:27.547
The kid doesn't
even communicate.

21:27.590 --> 21:29.462
Honestly, dude, the FlyQuest
offer is still on the table,

21:29.505 --> 21:31.115
so maybe I should
just go with them.

21:31.159 --> 21:33.683
Honestly, Trevor,
if-if you are gonna continue

21:33.727 --> 21:35.772
every week
threatening to leave the team,

21:35.816 --> 21:37.774
I don't want you on the team.
I don't want you in Fugitive.

21:37.818 --> 21:39.385
-What do you mean...
-If you go to FlyQuest...

21:39.428 --> 21:41.256
-You don't want me in Fugitive?
-If you're going

21:41.300 --> 21:42.562
-to threaten to leave every...
-Are you fucking kidding me?

21:42.605 --> 21:44.607
You can't kick me
out of Fugitive.

21:44.651 --> 21:46.392
-Fugitive is my fucking team.
-It's your team.

21:46.435 --> 21:48.481
I am Fugitive.
Yeah, it's my team.

21:48.524 --> 21:50.787
-I built this fucking team.
-I want to hear, y-you're saying

21:50.831 --> 21:54.356
that this is not as much
my team as it is yours.

21:54.400 --> 21:56.706
That I haven't put as much
into this team as you have.

21:56.750 --> 21:58.012
[sighs]

22:02.146 --> 22:03.147
It's our team. I mean,

22:03.191 --> 22:04.323
-it is our team.
-Thank you.

22:04.366 --> 22:06.237
I know you work hard.

22:06.281 --> 22:10.241
I just feel like... I really
want to win a championship.

22:10.285 --> 22:12.069
-I know.
-You know?

22:12.113 --> 22:15.072
I wanted to win--
I want to win one, too.

22:15.116 --> 22:16.857
-I want that.
-Okay, well, it just

22:16.900 --> 22:19.207
feels like Nathan is gone,

22:19.250 --> 22:22.602
this is our last chance.

22:22.645 --> 22:24.038
Okay, let me, let me

22:24.081 --> 22:25.518
-walk you through...
-Give me Frugger.

22:25.561 --> 22:27.781
I will win a championship
if you give me Frugger.

22:27.824 --> 22:30.087
...my train of thought
here, okay?

22:30.131 --> 22:34.222
On the one hand,
we have Organizm.

22:34.265 --> 22:37.094
Who, while you were gone,
by the way,

22:37.138 --> 22:39.445
held it down with Cronklyn.

22:39.488 --> 22:41.664
CREAMCHEESE:
But he still lost.

22:41.708 --> 22:43.579
KYLE:
With Cronklyn.

22:43.623 --> 22:45.233
I'm sorry.

22:45.276 --> 22:47.888
And on the other hand,
we-we have Frugger,

22:47.931 --> 22:51.805
who hasn't scrimmed with us
since January.

22:51.848 --> 22:56.157
Look, if Org
shits the bed tomorrow,

22:56.200 --> 22:58.377
I'm right there with you,
we put Frugger in next week.

22:58.420 --> 23:01.380
You know, we have him start
scrimming immediately, but...

23:01.423 --> 23:02.946
it cannot be tomorrow.

23:02.990 --> 23:04.992
It just doesn't make sense.
You know this.

23:05.035 --> 23:07.168
[sighs]

23:09.083 --> 23:12.391
Yo, you know
you don't need Nathan, right?

23:12.434 --> 23:15.916
'Cause the only one
that you need is you.

23:15.959 --> 23:18.571
And me, you need me, too.
But you already know that shit.

23:18.614 --> 23:20.181
[laughs softly]

23:20.224 --> 23:22.096
It's like back in college,

23:22.139 --> 23:23.967
when I played against Ursinus,
you remember that shit,

23:24.011 --> 23:25.926
like I was doing everything
in my power to make sure

23:25.969 --> 23:27.318
my ass didn't get cut.

23:27.362 --> 23:29.190
I stepped the fuck up, man.

23:29.233 --> 23:31.671
Eight points,
five fucking rebounds.

23:31.714 --> 23:34.108
I took a charge in there,
I played like fire

23:34.151 --> 23:36.240
'cause that's what winners do--
that's what Elmores do.

23:36.284 --> 23:37.851
That's our shit. We win.

23:39.809 --> 23:43.465
Let me ask you something, man,
you gonna step up?

23:43.509 --> 23:46.468
-Yeah.
-You gonna step up, Percy?

23:46.512 --> 23:48.035
-Hmm? You gonna step--
-Yeah.

23:48.078 --> 23:51.473
-you gonna step up, Organizm?
-Yeah.

23:51.517 --> 23:53.127
ORGANIZM:
Rudy's always telling

23:53.170 --> 23:55.259
D3 basketball stories.

23:55.303 --> 23:58.567
It's like advice
or something, but...

23:58.611 --> 24:01.483
You know he just wants me
to win, and I do, too.

24:01.527 --> 24:03.050
And you gonna prove
that you the shit,

24:03.093 --> 24:05.095
that you the fucking man,
a'ight?

24:05.139 --> 24:09.099
'Cause this is your kingdom,
and you gonna rule.

24:09.143 --> 24:10.579
ORGANIZM:
Because going back to Academy

24:10.623 --> 24:12.581
would just mean that I failed.

24:12.625 --> 24:16.106
And I don't fail.

24:20.850 --> 24:23.200
DASH: Welcome back to the LCS,
where we turn out attention

24:23.244 --> 24:25.333
to the next game of the day,
and it's a big one.

24:25.376 --> 24:26.987
MARKZ: For Creamcheese,
that's who I'm looking at--

24:27.030 --> 24:28.945
he has never missed
a mid-season showdown.

24:28.989 --> 24:30.773
He has made it
every single time in spring,

24:30.817 --> 24:32.775
and you know that he wants
to continue that streak.

24:32.819 --> 24:34.037
[cheering, applause]

24:35.996 --> 24:40.087
CAPTAINFLOWERS: And this is
a massive game for Fugitive.

24:40.130 --> 24:42.089
They need this victory
if they want to keep

24:42.132 --> 24:43.960
their chances of playing in
the mid-season showdown alive.

24:44.004 --> 24:45.396
KOBE:
And in order to do that

24:45.440 --> 24:47.268
versus 100 Thieves,
who have been killing it,

24:47.311 --> 24:50.489
they need Organizm to step up.

24:50.532 --> 24:52.708
RUDY JR.: Going into this game,
it was all on him.

24:52.752 --> 24:54.841
-You got this!
-I mean, I ain't trying to say

24:54.884 --> 24:55.972
I was nervous,
but I was nervous.

24:56.016 --> 24:57.321
This is you.

24:57.365 --> 24:59.541
His job was on the line.

24:59.585 --> 25:00.890
CAPTAINFLOWERS: Org follows in
with an aggressive flash,

25:00.934 --> 25:02.544
but he can't finish him off.

25:02.588 --> 25:05.547
And 100 Thieves
will turn that one around.

25:05.591 --> 25:08.942
That is first blood and Organizm
pays dearly for the flash.

25:08.985 --> 25:11.161
Oh, my fucking God,
are you kidding me, bro?

25:11.205 --> 25:13.120
Stay with it. Don't give up!

25:13.163 --> 25:14.861
CAPTAINFLOWERS: Gragas is
circling around for the dive.

25:14.904 --> 25:17.124
They're going after Organizm,
and there it is.

25:17.167 --> 25:21.171
The E flash.
Organizm has no way out.

25:21.215 --> 25:22.782
Okay, fuck this. I'm coming top.

25:22.825 --> 25:24.827
-I'm not gonna stay in bot-lane.
-No, this wave is good.

25:24.871 --> 25:27.134
KOBE: Creamcheese is trying to
make something happen topside.

25:27.177 --> 25:29.266
CAPTAINFLOWERS: Hey, those moves
are going to get them

25:29.310 --> 25:32.008
this Herald, this topside river
is uncontested.

25:32.052 --> 25:33.575
Hell yeah, let's go.

25:33.619 --> 25:35.098
CAPTAINFLOWERS: Organizm
has got to be careful.

25:35.142 --> 25:36.752
He's staying around
for too long--

25:36.796 --> 25:39.842
He should have backed! Too late.

25:39.886 --> 25:42.062
-Fuck.
-Go in. Is this a joke?

25:42.105 --> 25:44.804
CAPTAINFLOWERS: Organizm
is finding himself alone

25:44.847 --> 25:47.894
and out of position
throughout this entire game.

25:47.937 --> 25:49.548
[echoing]:
Organizm takes the Blast Cone,

25:49.591 --> 25:51.419
but he'll be
immediately exploded

25:51.462 --> 25:54.770
by the Gragas cast
and Yasuo combination.

25:54.814 --> 25:58.687
KOBE: Organizm just racking up
death after death in this game.

26:00.559 --> 26:02.604
I hope you're enjoying
your last pro game, Org,

26:02.648 --> 26:04.345
'cause I'm
certainly fucking not.

26:04.388 --> 26:06.173
KOBE: Creamcheese and Organizm
don't even look

26:06.216 --> 26:09.132
like they're playing
the same game.

26:09.176 --> 26:11.613
CAPTAINFLOWERS: There it goes.
There's the Gragas flash.

26:11.657 --> 26:14.616
They engage,
and the Yasuo falls.

26:14.660 --> 26:17.837
It's the end of Fugitive Gaming.

26:17.880 --> 26:19.273
That's game. No, that's game.

26:21.536 --> 26:23.277
CAPTAINFLOWERS:
With that loss,

26:23.320 --> 26:25.627
Fugitive is
statistically eliminated

26:25.671 --> 26:28.630
from the mid-season showdown
here for the first time

26:28.674 --> 26:30.589
in Creamcheese's career.

26:32.808 --> 26:36.029
And all on the back
of an absolutely brutal showing

26:36.072 --> 26:37.857
by his teammate
and young rookie.

26:37.900 --> 26:40.424
KOBE: Yeah, I don't know what
was going on with him, Clayton.

26:40.468 --> 26:42.557
He was just dying
all over the place.

26:47.606 --> 26:50.304
Jesus Christ.
It's time to have a real idea.

26:50.347 --> 26:52.698
I-I can't, I can't.

26:52.741 --> 26:54.917
I-I can't give time
for this shit.

26:54.961 --> 26:56.440
It's, like, seven times?
Eight times?

26:56.484 --> 26:58.442
Truly.

26:58.486 --> 27:00.314
What the hell was that?

27:03.273 --> 27:04.710
CREAMCHEESE: Wait,
are you talking to me?

27:04.753 --> 27:07.408
-Yeah. I'm talking to you.
-About the game?

27:07.451 --> 27:09.149
You didn't follow the game plan.

27:09.192 --> 27:11.368
-You abandoned bot-lane.
-I...

27:11.412 --> 27:13.457
You want to tell me
what you were doing?

27:13.501 --> 27:15.372
Are you kidding me?
I carried the whole game.

27:15.416 --> 27:17.810
It's not carrying
if you lose the game.

27:17.853 --> 27:20.203
[laughs]: It was not my fault
that we lost the game.

27:20.247 --> 27:22.336
There's nothing I could do.
I was the only one making plays.

27:22.379 --> 27:26.166
Making-- You were forcing plays
that weren't even there!

27:27.689 --> 27:29.909
-Are you joking?
-No.

27:29.952 --> 27:31.737
-No, I'm not.
-You think that's my fault?

27:31.780 --> 27:33.564
Are you fucking kidd--
Did you-- were you not watching

27:33.608 --> 27:35.001
-the same game I was watching?
-I was watching the game.

27:35.044 --> 27:37.264
-Nightfall...
-I watched the whole game.

27:37.307 --> 27:39.570
...how many fucking deaths
did this kid have?

27:39.614 --> 27:42.530
It was, like, eight? Seven?
I-I don't know.

27:42.573 --> 27:45.185
-There you go.
-But?

27:45.228 --> 27:47.100
Well, I mean, yeah,
I mean, him dying

27:47.143 --> 27:50.016
is his fault, but, like...

27:50.059 --> 27:54.673
I feel like you-you have
something to do with it, too.

27:54.716 --> 27:55.891
-What...
-Because?

27:55.935 --> 27:57.588
What could I have
literally done?

27:57.632 --> 27:59.416
I mean, like, you came
to the Herald fight

27:59.460 --> 28:01.984
where-- when we didn't
really need you there.

28:02.028 --> 28:03.769
-Yep.
-Like, Organizm said

28:03.812 --> 28:05.205
-he needed your bot.
-Oh, my fucking God.

28:05.248 --> 28:06.728
Are you guys kidding me?
Are you, are you

28:06.772 --> 28:08.382
-kidding me right now?
-It's-- It's true.

28:08.425 --> 28:09.731
I honestly
don't understand this.

28:09.775 --> 28:11.211
You guys are defending this kid

28:11.254 --> 28:12.908

for himself.

28:12.952 --> 28:15.215
He-he won't say anything.

28:20.046 --> 28:22.570
At level two, you exhausted
after the Cade headshot,

28:22.613 --> 28:24.572
which costed us first blood.

28:24.615 --> 28:26.356
At level five, you roamed mid

28:26.400 --> 28:28.054
when the wave was clearly
about to bounce back into us.

28:28.097 --> 28:30.099
-Oh, Jesus Christ. I can't...
-At level eight,

28:30.143 --> 28:32.319
you flashed Q to take
a kill that I could have had

28:32.362 --> 28:33.886
with my explosive shot.

28:33.929 --> 28:36.627
At level 11,
you went to ward pixel brush

28:36.671 --> 28:40.501
when we saw that Gragas
was pathing towards blue.

28:40.544 --> 28:43.069
At level 14, you engaged
when you should've peeled

28:43.112 --> 28:46.637
because Baps didn't have flash
and Nightfall didn't have ult,

28:46.681 --> 28:49.510
so no one
could keep up with you.

28:49.553 --> 28:52.556
Also, you missed
a lot of skillshots.

28:55.298 --> 28:56.560
RUDY JR.:
Fuck yeah, baby brah.

28:56.604 --> 28:58.258

29:01.348 --> 29:05.918
Really fucking helpful
and insightful after the game.

29:07.876 --> 29:11.184
Because, you know,
Organizm is usually quiet,

29:11.227 --> 29:14.622
I never thought that he would
be thinking about that stuff.

29:14.665 --> 29:17.451
Like, he remembered
every single second of the game.

29:17.494 --> 29:19.235
That was just amazing.

29:19.279 --> 29:21.281

That's what we need.

uh, and i-it just speaks
to his enormous potential.

29:28.984 --> 29:31.465
You should be a coach.

29:31.508 --> 29:33.641
The coach where, like, you know,
like your team loses

29:33.684 --> 29:35.643

really smartly afterwards

29:35.686 --> 29:38.254

about-about why they lost.

There's the kill on the Rell,
