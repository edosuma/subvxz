What is it you wanted
to talk about, Michael?

01:03.438 --> 01:05.273
Baseball.

Jean:
Baseball?

Hmm.

03:32.045 --> 03:33.546
Please don't say
anything to Sophie.

03:36.716 --> 03:38.551
Just let her see it.

Durham, North Carolina.

04:54.627 --> 04:55.628
As you can see...

04:58.131 --> 05:00.216
I'm not on
the Cabo diet today.

05:00.299 --> 05:02.343
Beef sliders are not
part of the regimen,

05:02.427 --> 05:05.263
but I'm back home
with my brother

05:05.346 --> 05:07.640
on a very important
family trip.

05:09.642 --> 05:10.643
-No.
-Clay.

05:10.727 --> 05:14.605
-Clay-Man, say hi.
-Get the fuck outta here.

05:14.689 --> 05:18.401
Well, he has always been
the shyer brother.

05:18.484 --> 05:20.903
Anyways, thank you guys
so much for checking in,

05:20.987 --> 05:23.656
and I hope to be back soon
with some good news.

05:27.827 --> 05:29.203
How many people watch that?

05:29.287 --> 05:33.541
Well, it's like a little
over 100 every post.

05:33.624 --> 05:35.877
But it's all about
consistency and quantity.

05:35.960 --> 05:36.294
I mean, that's how
you build the following.

05:39.172 --> 05:40.548
Do you think people
are there because of Dad?

05:41.215 --> 05:43.259
Yeah, I mean, absolutely.

05:43.342 --> 05:45.595
There's people that
are fans of the, the doc,

05:45.678 --> 05:46.804
true crime fans.

05:47.805 --> 05:49.515
I mean, even people
that don't like Dad

05:49.599 --> 05:50.892
are happy
to see me doing well.

05:54.395 --> 05:55.480
Well, you're doing great, man.

Thanks, Clay.

Margaret Ratliff:
Are you reading Dad's book?

06:03.279 --> 06:04.697
Martha Ratliff:
Yeah.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.991
My therapist recommended
reading it years ago,

06:07.075 --> 06:09.118
but I just started.

06:10.828 --> 06:13.039
There's a lot to dissect
in there, Margie.

06:13.122 --> 06:13.414
I'm sure.

06:18.878 --> 06:20.838
(phone chimes)

06:22.548 --> 06:23.841
You have a match.

06:25.885 --> 06:27.011
You want to see?

06:30.306 --> 06:31.641
Can you check it?

06:31.724 --> 06:32.725
Yeah.

06:44.779 --> 06:47.031
She's cute.

06:47.782 --> 06:49.617
Oh yeah?

06:51.160 --> 06:52.161
Let me see.

07:01.754 --> 07:02.839
Hm...

07:06.759 --> 07:08.052
Why are you smiling?

07:11.055 --> 07:12.431
I don't know,
you just, you...

07:13.808 --> 07:14.475
you never said
anything to me.

07:17.854 --> 07:20.231
You never asked.

07:20.314 --> 07:22.441
Like, no one ever asked me.

07:22.525 --> 07:23.484
I would have told you.

07:26.028 --> 07:27.572
I just, I, I just...

07:28.906 --> 07:31.367
figured you didn't
want to talk about it.

07:31.450 --> 07:33.494
That's the whole fucked-up thing
about our family, Margie.

07:33.578 --> 07:35.371
Like, nobody,

07:35.454 --> 07:39.041
nobody ever really just
talks about anything, ever.

07:39.125 --> 07:41.210
Like, we haven't
talked about

07:41.294 --> 07:42.420
my trip,
about Germany.

07:42.503 --> 07:45.381
Yeah, we did.
You said it was enlightening.

07:45.464 --> 07:47.884
Okay. Yeah, but, like,
don't you want to know why?

07:47.967 --> 07:48.885
Jesus, Martha.
Why does everything have

07:48.968 --> 07:51.053
to be so serious?

07:51.137 --> 07:52.555
It's my birthday tomorrow.

07:52.638 --> 07:55.474
Can we just eat a bunch of candy
and act like 15-year-olds

07:55.558 --> 07:58.227
who've never had
a hotel room to themselves?
Please.

08:08.321 --> 08:11.866
I know, I know. I just...
I want to celebrate this moment.

08:11.949 --> 08:14.243
Celebrate how?

08:22.460 --> 08:25.421

-Kathleen Peterson: Hey, Candy.

09:30.319 --> 09:31.487
Oh, hey.

09:33.447 --> 09:36.617
I know we haven't spoken
since Thanksgiving.

09:36.701 --> 09:40.746
It's, it's all been
really... crazy.

09:40.830 --> 09:42.790
(chuckles)
Yeah. Same here.

09:43.499 --> 09:46.043
Kathleen:
Right. Um...

09:47.295 --> 09:50.339
Anyway, I,
I wanted to say...

09:53.259 --> 09:55.594
thank you for hosting us.

09:55.678 --> 09:57.346
Candace Zamperini:
Of course, was happy to spend
some time with Mike.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.932
I hope everyone
got enough to eat.

10:02.018 --> 10:04.437
How's work?
Is it any easier this week?

10:04.520 --> 10:07.189
Well, no,
they're sending me

10:07.273 --> 10:09.692
on this last-minute trip
to Toronto.

10:09.775 --> 10:11.986
-Everything okay there?
-Candace: It's fine.

10:12.069 --> 10:13.362
You know, full steam
ahead for Christmas.

10:13.446 --> 10:15.406
I'm at the doctor now.
Just...

10:15.489 --> 10:17.825
-Kathleen: You okay?
-Yeah, fine.

10:17.908 --> 10:20.536
Just, you know, routine.

10:20.620 --> 10:21.954
Can never be too careful.

10:23.748 --> 10:24.749
Are you doing okay?

10:24.832 --> 10:26.542
I was really worried
after you left.

10:26.625 --> 10:26.667
Hey...

10:28.669 --> 10:30.629
what if I ditched
the Toronto trip

10:30.713 --> 10:32.173
and you leave Ash
with Mark

10:32.256 --> 10:33.341
and we get a flight
to Turks and Caicos?

10:33.424 --> 10:35.885
What are you talking about?

10:35.968 --> 10:37.553
Yeah. Or Aruba.

10:37.636 --> 10:40.181
I mean,
we deserve it, right?

10:40.264 --> 10:41.766
Are you joking?

10:47.355 --> 10:48.230
Of course.

10:48.314 --> 10:50.649
Candace: (chuckles)
Yeah. That's funny.

10:53.861 --> 10:54.695
Yeah.

10:54.779 --> 10:58.407
Alright. Well, I got
to get back to it.

10:58.491 --> 10:59.784
Candace:
Okay.

10:59.867 --> 11:01.243

Love to Mark and Ash.

20:46.244 --> 20:48.288
Kathleen's family
would like to be heard.

20:48.372 --> 20:49.331
I'd like to call
Candace Zamperini.

20:57.422 --> 20:59.007
-Good morning.
-Judge Hudson: Good morning.

21:00.676 --> 21:03.887
I'm Candace Zamperini,
one of Kathleen's sisters.

21:05.472 --> 21:07.057
Not long after
my sister's death,

21:07.140 --> 21:08.266
I went for the first time

21:08.350 --> 21:11.019
to meet with
District Attorney Jim Hardin.

21:11.103 --> 21:12.229
Inevitably, I didn't
want to believe.

21:14.106 --> 21:16.441
Obviously, I didn't
want to believe

21:16.525 --> 21:18.694
that my sister
had been murdered.

21:18.777 --> 21:20.821
I was sure
this was an accident.

21:21.863 --> 21:23.532
At that meeting,
Jim Hardin asked

21:23.615 --> 21:25.701
if I wanted to see
the autopsy pictures

21:25.784 --> 21:27.119
and some crime scene photos.

21:29.871 --> 21:33.125
It was my Pandora's box.

21:35.961 --> 21:38.714
All the evils
of my sister's death

21:38.797 --> 21:40.632
leaped into my eyes.

21:40.716 --> 21:43.802
The horrors of my sister's
beating were shown.

21:43.885 --> 21:45.554
And because of you,

21:45.637 --> 21:47.305
my sister has been gone

21:47.389 --> 21:50.434
from this world for ten years.

21:51.852 --> 21:55.313
Ten years ago today,
she was murdered.

21:55.397 --> 22:00.235
Her 35 cuts, bruises,
wounds, contusions.

22:00.318 --> 22:03.155
Yes, she was strangled.

22:03.238 --> 22:05.490
And the seven death blows
to the back of her head,

22:05.574 --> 22:09.202
causing her to bleed
slowly to death.

22:09.286 --> 22:12.581
My sister has lied
in her grave for 16 years.

22:12.664 --> 22:16.001
Ten years

22:16.084 --> 22:18.920
Lori and I have been
without our sister

22:19.004 --> 22:22.174
and ten years
her daughter hasn't had her.

22:22.883 --> 22:25.093
You took the life

22:26.428 --> 22:28.388
of the one
that provided for you...

22:31.475 --> 22:33.226
and guided your children.

22:34.061 --> 22:36.188
She loved you guys.

22:38.356 --> 22:38.440
She loved you.

22:41.526 --> 22:45.113
Kathleen was the best thing
you ever had.

22:46.907 --> 22:49.701
Michael Peterson
was correctly charged,

22:49.785 --> 22:51.328
and he is pleading
guilty today.

22:51.411 --> 22:55.290
The words "Alford plea,"
they're meaningless.

22:55.373 --> 23:00.420
Alford schmal-ford.
Means nothing. Guilt.

23:00.504 --> 23:02.380
An innocent man
doesn't plead guilty.

23:02.464 --> 23:03.465
A guilty one does.

23:03.548 --> 23:07.803
And that's why I'm asking you,
Judge Hudson, today

23:07.886 --> 23:12.516
to immediately dismiss
this retrial hearing.

23:13.558 --> 23:14.768
Please.

23:14.851 --> 23:15.852
Please.

23:21.066 --> 23:23.318
Do not give this killer
a chance at freedom.

23:25.112 --> 23:26.947
Thank you, Your Honor.

23:32.953 --> 23:34.037
(exhales)

23:38.458 --> 23:42.546
Your words are very moving,
Mrs. Zamperini.

23:42.629 --> 23:45.298
Your sister's memory
is not lost on this court.

23:51.930 --> 23:53.348
Come on. Come on.

23:59.104 --> 24:00.355
The court,
in its discretion,

24:00.438 --> 24:03.692
will deny the motion
to dismiss the hearing.

24:07.028 --> 24:10.115
The court is ready to proceed
with the hearing for a retrial.

24:10.782 --> 24:11.908
(door opens)

24:19.124 --> 24:20.667
Your Honor,
I would like to call

24:20.750 --> 24:22.919
Evelyn Ivins
to the stand.

24:23.003 --> 24:25.422
Evelyn Ivins:
I was specifically
focused on Greg Taylor,

24:25.505 --> 24:27.549
who was
wrongfully convicted,

24:27.632 --> 24:29.718
which led me
to Duane Deaver

24:29.801 --> 24:33.305
and the inner workings
of the North Carolina SBI.

24:33.388 --> 24:35.056
What did you learn?

24:35.140 --> 24:37.851
For years, the SBI
has been engaging

24:37.934 --> 24:40.353
in unconstitutional behavior,

24:40.437 --> 24:43.398
hiding exculpatory evidence
from the defense

24:43.481 --> 24:45.692
in order to ensure
convictions for the state.

24:46.818 --> 24:48.778
David Rudolf:
Thank you, Ms. Ivins.

24:48.862 --> 24:51.156
Jim Hardin: (on screen)
And why should we trust you?

24:51.239 --> 24:55.243
Well, sir, I've written
over 200 bloodstain reports

24:55.327 --> 24:59.247
and overseen 500 scenes.

25:00.332 --> 25:01.833
Jim:
No further questions,
Your Honor.

25:04.169 --> 25:05.962
David: Have you had
a chance to review

25:06.046 --> 25:07.297
all documents
provided by the State

25:07.380 --> 25:11.051
related to
Agent Duane Deaver's

25:11.134 --> 25:12.636
20-year career?

25:13.678 --> 25:14.137
I did.

25:14.221 --> 25:16.223
Well over 100,000 pages.

25:16.306 --> 25:20.268
And you reviewed
all of that?

25:20.352 --> 25:21.686
Ron Guerette:
Unfortunately.

25:21.770 --> 25:23.396
-Yeah. Alright. Alright.
-(crowd laughs)

25:23.480 --> 25:26.066
How many cases
were there in total

25:26.149 --> 25:30.111
in which Agent Deaver
just observed bloodstains,

25:30.195 --> 25:33.657
either at the scene,
at the SBI laboratory,

25:33.740 --> 25:36.493
or by looking at photos?

25:36.576 --> 25:38.119
Only 54.

25:38.203 --> 25:40.288
In how many of those cases
did Agent Deaver provide

25:40.372 --> 25:44.334
a bloodstain pattern
analysis opinion?

25:44.417 --> 25:46.795
Thirty-six. Not 200.

25:46.878 --> 25:49.089
David:
Not 200.

25:49.172 --> 25:51.549
How many cases were there
in which Agent Deaver

25:51.633 --> 25:54.636
actually performed tests

25:54.719 --> 25:56.263
or experiments

25:56.346 --> 25:58.181
before the Peterson case?

25:58.265 --> 26:01.851
Three. Only three.

26:01.935 --> 26:03.520
Mr. Guerette, if someone
claims that they've worked

26:03.603 --> 26:08.608
on hundreds of cases
over a 20-year career

26:08.692 --> 26:11.569
but actually only worked

26:11.653 --> 26:14.072
on less than five,
what would you call that?

26:14.155 --> 26:15.031
-Lying.
-Lawyer: Objection,
Your Honor.

26:15.115 --> 26:16.616
-That is a lie.
-Judge Hudson: Sustained.

26:19.077 --> 26:20.412
David:
No more questions,
Your Honor.

26:21.705 --> 26:24.833
As Mrs. Zamperini
mentioned earlier,

26:24.916 --> 26:27.127
today marks
the ten-year anniversary

26:27.210 --> 26:29.337
of Kathleen's death.

26:30.422 --> 26:31.715
Ten years ago,

26:32.549 --> 26:35.802
Michael
and Kathleen Peterson

26:35.885 --> 26:38.138
enjoyed a night in
with a movie

26:38.221 --> 26:40.724
from Blockbusters,
"America's Sweethearts."

26:42.267 --> 26:45.353
After she finished
with a work call,

26:45.437 --> 26:47.022
they decided to go out
by the pool

26:47.105 --> 26:49.482
with a bottle of wine.

26:50.483 --> 26:53.236
They talked about the kids

26:53.320 --> 26:55.280
and Christmas.

26:55.363 --> 26:57.490
They were looking
towards the future.

26:58.408 --> 27:01.369
Then she said good night.

27:01.453 --> 27:02.579
Michael stayed out
by the pool.

27:07.917 --> 27:09.878
And when he
came back in later,

27:09.961 --> 27:11.296
he found his wife...

27:12.589 --> 27:15.550
the love of his life,
barely breathing

27:15.633 --> 27:18.762
at the bottom of the steps
from a fall.

27:20.347 --> 27:23.725
A tragic accident.

27:23.808 --> 27:27.354
But in large part
because of Duane Deaver,

27:27.437 --> 27:30.899
the DA convinced the jury
that this was murder.

27:30.982 --> 27:34.402
What we know now is that
Deaver had a habit

27:34.486 --> 27:37.405
of preparing
misleading reports

27:37.489 --> 27:40.075
and presenting
misleading testimony

27:40.158 --> 27:41.201
under oath.

27:42.327 --> 27:44.704
We never asked
for a perfect trial.

27:46.498 --> 27:46.623
Uh...

27:51.503 --> 27:53.880
but we at least
deserved a fair one.

27:53.963 --> 27:55.673
I'm therefore going to ask
the court at this time

27:55.757 --> 27:58.676
to grant Michael Peterson
a new trial

27:58.760 --> 28:02.430
at which the evidence
can be presented

28:02.514 --> 28:04.933
in a fair
and unbiased way.

28:05.016 --> 28:06.434
Then...

28:08.103 --> 28:10.105
let a jury of 12, uh...

28:11.856 --> 28:12.816
sort it out.

28:14.609 --> 28:14.734
Thank you, Your Honor.

28:23.743 --> 28:23.785
Alright.

28:25.703 --> 28:27.705
Would the defendant
please rise?

28:30.875 --> 28:33.002
Do you understand, sir,
that you do have the right

28:33.086 --> 28:36.047
to plead not guilty
and have a jury trial?

28:37.006 --> 28:39.676
-Yes.
-Judge Hudson:
Mr. Peterson,

28:39.759 --> 28:41.302
you're pleading guilty pursuant

28:41.386 --> 28:43.471
to North Carolina
versus Alford case

28:43.555 --> 28:45.098
of voluntary manslaughter.

28:45.181 --> 28:47.100
-Do you understand, sir?
-Yes.

28:47.183 --> 28:47.976
Judge Hudson:
Has Mr. Peterson proven

28:48.059 --> 28:51.062
that Duane Deaver
misled this court?

28:51.146 --> 28:53.857
The answer to
that question is yes.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.610
Has Mr. Peterson proven
that Duane Deaver misled

28:57.694 --> 29:01.489
the jury on the validity
of his argument?

29:01.573 --> 29:02.824
The answer to
that question is...

29:04.325 --> 29:05.368
yes.

29:06.244 --> 29:09.164
Was Deaver's
misleading testimony

29:09.247 --> 29:10.915
critical and material

29:10.999 --> 29:14.210
to the conviction
of Mr. Peterson?

29:14.294 --> 29:16.087
The answer to
that question is...

29:16.421 --> 29:17.672
yes.

29:21.718 --> 29:22.844
Alright.

29:22.927 --> 29:25.889
Do you understand that
when you enter a plea of Alford,

29:25.972 --> 29:27.932
the court will treat you
as though you're guilty

29:28.016 --> 29:30.018
for the purpose
of sentencing?

29:30.101 --> 29:30.810
Yes, sir.

29:30.894 --> 29:33.313
Judge Hudson:
So, Mr. Peterson,

29:33.396 --> 29:35.607
to the charge
of voluntary manslaughter

29:35.690 --> 29:37.150
in the death
of Kathleen Peterson,

29:37.233 --> 29:38.651
how do you plead?

29:54.626 --> 29:55.668
Guilty.

29:56.961 --> 29:58.129
I plead guilty.

29:59.797 --> 30:01.382
Judge Hudson:
The court finds
that the defendant

30:01.466 --> 30:02.634
will receive a new trial

30:02.717 --> 30:04.677
at a time that
the State deems fit.

30:04.761 --> 30:06.429
(all exclaiming)

30:08.306 --> 30:09.098
The court will begin
the process

30:09.182 --> 30:11.809
of releasing
Mr. Peterson immediately.

30:12.852 --> 30:14.604
The court finds
that Mr. Peterson

30:14.687 --> 30:17.232
has fulfilled his obligation
pursuant to the Alford plea

30:17.315 --> 30:19.943
and has no further obligations
to the State of North Carolina.

30:20.026 --> 30:22.111
-You're free to go.
-(gavel banging)

30:22.195 --> 30:23.279
Judge Hudson:
Court dismissed.

30:29.786 --> 30:30.745
Congratulations.

30:31.371 --> 30:33.289
Alright, let's, uh...

30:50.682 --> 30:53.017
Bailiff:
You have a 10 p.m. curfew

30:53.101 --> 30:55.186
that will be
strictly monitored.

30:56.354 --> 30:57.480
Be right back.

30:58.189 --> 31:00.108
(door opens)

31:02.527 --> 31:03.611
(door closes)

31:13.580 --> 31:16.833
-(cork pops)
-(all cheering)

31:21.379 --> 31:23.298
Do you want to shower
and get some rest?

31:23.381 --> 31:27.260
No. No, no,
absolutely not.

31:27.343 --> 31:29.429
No, no, I'm okay.
Thank you.

31:30.388 --> 31:32.557
(Christmas music playing)

31:34.434 --> 31:36.978
So, you old man, where do
you want to go celebrate?

31:39.689 --> 31:41.733
Clay, let's go to Amalfi.

31:41.816 --> 31:45.403
I feel I could eat
an enormous, obscene bowl

31:45.486 --> 31:46.487
of spaghetti
and meatballs.

31:46.571 --> 31:48.031
-Can you get on that?
-Clayton: On it.

31:49.741 --> 31:51.576
Jessica: (on phone)
Amalfi. This is Jessica.
How may I help you?

31:51.659 --> 31:52.869
Yeah, I need to make
a reservation

31:52.952 --> 31:54.996
for a large group,
12 for tonight.

31:55.079 --> 31:56.998
Jessica:
Certainly. What's the name?

31:57.081 --> 31:58.124
Uh, it's for Michael Peterson.

31:58.207 --> 32:00.460
Jessica:
Michael Peterson,
Michael Peterson?

32:01.586 --> 32:04.505
-Yes.
-Jessica: Oh. Okay.

32:04.589 --> 32:05.840
Just a moment.
Please hold.

32:09.093 --> 32:11.512
Man: (on phone)
Hello. Are you calling
about Michael Peterson?

32:11.596 --> 32:14.349
Yep. We used
to go there all the time.

32:14.432 --> 32:15.975
Yes. Well, the thing is
we don't seat convicted killers.

32:17.685 --> 32:18.853
Thank you.

32:30.114 --> 32:33.076
Reporter: In 2011,
Michael Peterson
was granted a retrial

32:33.159 --> 32:35.703
and released from prison
based on a technicality.

32:35.787 --> 32:37.914
-Michael: We good?
-Amalfi can't take us.

32:37.997 --> 32:38.998
We're too big of a party.

32:41.292 --> 32:43.586
How does everyone feel
about Baja Palace?

32:43.670 --> 32:45.463
Reporter: Peterson remained
out of prison

32:45.546 --> 32:46.798
for the last six years
awaiting the retrial.

32:46.881 --> 32:49.550
But the negotiations
between the State

32:49.634 --> 32:50.885
and the defense
ended in a stalemate,

32:50.968 --> 32:53.096
with both sides conceding that
a retrial could be difficult.

32:53.179 --> 32:57.392
Today, Michael Peterson
entered an Alford plea,

32:57.475 --> 32:59.602
thus ending
the 16-year saga

32:59.686 --> 33:01.979
of the State versus
Michael Iver Peterson.

33:02.063 --> 33:04.649
Tune in later tonight
for my sit-down interview

33:04.732 --> 33:06.859
with Michael Peterson himself.

33:06.943 --> 33:07.735
Man:
You want me to keep going?

33:07.819 --> 33:12.240
Uh... sorry.
Give me a minute.

33:12.323 --> 33:14.033
-Man: Yeah, of course. I get it.
-(notification chimes)

33:16.369 --> 33:19.455
(cheering)

33:20.707 --> 33:22.583
Hi, everybody.

33:22.667 --> 33:25.837
-Whoa!
-Woman: Whoo! Come on, Nate!

33:25.920 --> 33:27.088
Whoo! You got this!

33:29.549 --> 33:33.344
(texts blooping)

33:41.185 --> 33:41.978
(keys clacking)

33:47.191 --> 33:49.110
(sighs)

33:49.193 --> 33:52.447
Don't be afraid to possess
the space that you need

33:52.530 --> 33:54.615
to express these feelings.

33:54.699 --> 33:57.326
You're safe here.
This is a safe space.

33:57.410 --> 34:00.663
(kids whooping, growling)

34:16.554 --> 34:18.014
-Man: You okay?
-(sighs) Yeah.

34:21.017 --> 34:22.643
-Let's get back to it.
-Alright.

34:22.727 --> 34:23.978
Interviewer: (on TV)
What was the worst part?

34:25.354 --> 34:27.148
Do we have
to show my face?

34:27.231 --> 34:27.899
Interviewer:
Of course not. No.

34:27.982 --> 34:30.276
Whatever makes you comfortable.

34:30.359 --> 34:31.903
Tilt down, please.

34:33.988 --> 34:36.491
Hey, guys. Todd here.

34:36.574 --> 34:39.619
You know, every day I wake up
just so grateful.

34:39.702 --> 34:41.287
Grateful to be alive
and to be healthy

34:41.370 --> 34:44.207
and to be talking
to you guys.

34:44.290 --> 34:45.708
I know last week
I was a bit confused

34:45.792 --> 34:48.002
in anticipation of today.

34:49.545 --> 34:51.255
A lot of you guys
reached out to me

34:51.339 --> 34:52.840
to check in
to see if I was okay,

34:52.924 --> 34:55.051
and that meant
the world to me.

34:59.472 --> 35:00.932
Lori Campbell:
I don't know, Candy.
I just...

35:03.392 --> 35:04.644
I feel nothing now.

35:04.727 --> 35:06.521
Well, then something maybe
is wrong with me

35:06.604 --> 35:07.146
because I still feel pissed.

35:10.316 --> 35:11.651
We waited six years
for a retrial--

35:11.734 --> 35:14.445
You have to let it go.

35:16.572 --> 35:17.949
We knew.

35:18.491 --> 35:20.326
I knew

35:21.619 --> 35:22.078
something was wrong
with him.

35:26.749 --> 35:28.251
Why didn't...

35:28.334 --> 35:30.461
why didn't we say
anything to Kathleen?

35:32.713 --> 35:35.842
To be polite?

35:35.925 --> 35:38.970
We couldn't tell our sister
to leave her husband

35:39.053 --> 35:40.179
because we thought that
he was an arrogant jerk.

35:41.848 --> 35:42.557
Candace:
No.

35:42.640 --> 35:44.684
It was more than that.

35:49.772 --> 35:50.189
I had a feeling.

35:52.233 --> 35:53.067
Lori:
You can't stop fate.

35:53.150 --> 35:56.571
Kathleen died the day
that she met him.

36:02.535 --> 36:05.496
♪

36:23.055 --> 36:24.849
What are you
thinking about?

36:26.809 --> 36:29.729
Kathleen:
Oh, I'm thinking
about going to Aruba.

36:30.438 --> 36:31.397
Then Paris.

36:33.190 --> 36:35.109
Or Paris then Aruba.

36:36.694 --> 36:40.323
And then I'm thinking
about how I can't afford
anywhere but Durham.

36:42.366 --> 36:45.620
Well, honey, we can afford
pasta and Blockbusters.

36:45.703 --> 36:46.287

37:01.552 --> 37:03.471
Oh, maybe they have, uh...

37:03.554 --> 37:05.556
(indistinct chatter)

37:08.768 --> 37:11.437
Oh yeah.
It's him.

37:11.520 --> 37:12.813
(indistinct chatter)

37:12.897 --> 37:16.317
Should we say something?

37:16.400 --> 37:19.236
Clayton:
No, just ignore it.
We have nothing to hide.

37:19.320 --> 37:19.654
Waiter:
What would you like?

37:19.737 --> 37:22.573
Uh, well...

37:24.909 --> 37:25.201
(clears throat)
Here, Dad, you need help?

37:26.786 --> 37:28.829
Uh, fuck.

37:28.913 --> 37:30.998
Clayton, can you pick for me?

37:31.082 --> 37:32.458
-Clayton: Sure.
-You do it.

37:32.541 --> 37:34.001
Michael:
I haven't had good food
in a century.

37:34.085 --> 37:36.003
Clayton: He'll have
the steak fajitas, please.

37:36.087 --> 37:39.590
(Mexican music playing
over loudspeakers)

37:41.592 --> 37:42.468
Excuse me.

37:42.551 --> 37:44.637
Can I get a double tequila
neat, please.

37:44.720 --> 37:46.514
Yes, sir.

37:50.351 --> 37:53.396
Margaret:
Dad, I have a surprise.

All:
Oh.

(applause)

37:58.359 --> 37:59.527
What is it?
What is it?

37:59.610 --> 38:03.197
It's a, it's just a silly cup
that Kathleen and I bought.

38:03.280 --> 38:04.699
I hid it so
it wouldn't get sold.

38:04.782 --> 38:06.909
Who'd want it?

38:14.208 --> 38:15.876
-Dad--
-Please, no.

38:15.960 --> 38:16.377
Please, don't start with me.

38:20.881 --> 38:22.049
Okay.

38:23.426 --> 38:25.177
Um, Sophie,

38:25.803 --> 38:28.055
thank you for,

38:28.139 --> 38:29.890
for being there for our dad

38:29.974 --> 38:33.227
and for fighting for him.

38:33.310 --> 38:33.769
You never gave up.

38:33.853 --> 38:36.647
And I don't think

38:36.731 --> 38:38.649
my dad would be here
if it weren't for you.

38:40.484 --> 38:40.901
To Sophie.

38:40.985 --> 38:43.320
All:
To Sophie.

38:44.488 --> 38:46.073

Margaret:
Could you pass it?

38:48.576 --> 38:49.368
It's your turn.

38:50.536 --> 38:53.414
-To Margaret--
-No, you pick someone else.

38:53.497 --> 38:54.582
Sophie:
Okay.

38:54.665 --> 38:56.167
-(laughter)
-Okay.

(muttering in French)

38:59.503 --> 39:02.506
Um... to Martha.

39:02.590 --> 39:03.632
Oh!

39:03.716 --> 39:06.969
Well, from the first footage
that Jean sent to Paris,

39:07.053 --> 39:10.723
I knew you were bright...
and sensitive.

39:10.806 --> 39:14.268
It wasn't easy with the cameras
in your face all the time.

39:14.351 --> 39:16.771
But you had courage.
You didn't hide.

39:16.854 --> 39:19.065
So thank you for letting us
into your life.

39:19.148 --> 39:21.400
-To Martha.
-All: To Martha.

39:21.484 --> 39:26.489
And know all of you that
Paris is your second home.

39:27.531 --> 39:28.949
Margaret:
Great. Thank you.

39:29.033 --> 39:30.701
-Cheers to that.
-Waiter: Here you go.

39:30.785 --> 39:32.453
-Sophie: Just don't come
all together.
-Thank you.

39:32.536 --> 39:33.913
(laughter)

39:35.498 --> 39:36.791
Martha:
Thank you.

39:38.209 --> 39:40.586
Um... to Patty.

39:41.879 --> 39:44.423
Thank you for your kindness.

39:44.507 --> 39:46.759
What I've learned
about just empathy

39:46.842 --> 39:49.136
and understanding
from you has...

-You alright?
-Yeah. I'm okay.

40:02.566 --> 40:04.443
To my eldest.

40:04.527 --> 40:05.903
A husband,

40:05.986 --> 40:07.822
a father
in his own right,

40:07.905 --> 40:10.074
and a hero
to his own father

40:10.157 --> 40:12.159
all these years.

40:12.243 --> 40:14.745
How you turned
your life around.

40:15.955 --> 40:17.915
And I wasn't going
to tell you yet,

40:17.998 --> 40:20.000
but I have decided

40:20.084 --> 40:23.462
to relocate to Durham
to be closer to you, Michael,

40:24.547 --> 40:26.549
and to everyone here.

40:30.553 --> 40:33.055

-Surprise!

Sorry.

40:54.201 --> 40:56.495
Just another one, please.

Sorry, Clay, go on.

41:19.727 --> 41:21.353
Welcome home.
We missed you.

the man I am today.

What am I, incontinent?

the cheesecake.

Don't be so dramatic.

I don't even
like cheesecake.

47:55.664 --> 47:59.209
Come. Come to
your dear mama.

48:00.586 --> 48:01.962
Clayton, help me.

48:02.045 --> 48:03.839
-Come on.
-Clayton: Okay.

48:03.922 --> 48:05.090
-Come on.
-Patty: Come on.

48:05.173 --> 48:05.966
Todd:
I'm such a fuck-up, Mom.

48:06.049 --> 48:09.428
Patty: No, no, no.
You need some sleep.

48:14.891 --> 48:17.144
Oh shit. I forgot.
I got you a birthday present.

48:17.769 --> 48:18.770
Ooh.

48:20.772 --> 48:23.650
Don't say
I never got you anything.

48:36.663 --> 48:38.957
Margaret:
What is it?

48:39.041 --> 48:41.168
Martha:
It's the view
from our bedroom

48:41.251 --> 48:42.044
in Germany.

48:45.756 --> 48:47.341
We used to see that
every morning

48:47.424 --> 48:48.800
when we were little.

48:51.219 --> 48:52.304
It just seemed so peaceful

48:52.387 --> 48:53.889
that I thought
it would be a nice memory.

48:59.853 --> 48:59.895
I'm sorry.

49:01.521 --> 49:02.564
Why?

49:05.192 --> 49:06.693
You're the only one
in this family

49:06.777 --> 49:08.612
who's actually trying
to be honest.

49:10.739 --> 49:11.948
(sighs)

49:13.283 --> 49:14.618
And I lied to you.

49:16.286 --> 49:17.287
Not lied like...

49:18.705 --> 49:20.207
but I... (sighs)

49:23.085 --> 49:24.711
kept something from you.

49:31.551 --> 49:33.512
Dad tried to...

49:34.971 --> 49:36.848
separate us
when we were kids.

49:39.434 --> 49:41.603
Give you away
and keep me.

49:51.363 --> 49:54.241
And...

49:54.324 --> 49:57.244
I was so scared
that if it got out,

49:57.327 --> 49:58.620
it would hurt him.

50:00.163 --> 50:00.914
And...

50:04.584 --> 50:06.920
I wasn't thinking about you.

50:10.841 --> 50:11.925
You weren't.

50:13.677 --> 50:15.011
I'm sorry.

50:25.439 --> 50:27.524
You don't need
to protect me, you know,

50:27.607 --> 50:29.484
or anyone else, Margie.

50:31.945 --> 50:32.112
Not anymore.

50:36.700 --> 50:39.578
-It's okay.
-(sniffles)

50:41.913 --> 50:43.874
Just promise me...

50:43.957 --> 50:45.459
Well, we'll promise
each other.

50:45.542 --> 50:46.877
From here on out...

50:50.338 --> 50:52.466
we just, we live our own lives.

50:54.801 --> 50:55.802
Okay?

50:57.888 --> 50:59.931
Don't cry.

51:00.015 --> 51:01.016
(kissing)

51:04.770 --> 51:06.396
(door opens)

51:06.480 --> 51:08.607
-Michael: Oh. It's okay.
-I'm sorry.

51:18.408 --> 51:19.284
(keys clattering)

51:28.710 --> 51:30.837
-It's nice.
-Ah.

51:30.921 --> 51:32.339
It's nice.

51:32.422 --> 51:33.840
(faucet running)

51:53.443 --> 51:55.070
Shit.
It's stuck.

51:55.153 --> 51:57.030
-Let me help you.
-(Michael grunts)

51:57.113 --> 51:58.323
(Sophie chuckles)

52:03.245 --> 52:04.371
This thing got stuck.

52:07.332 --> 52:09.793
I got it. Alright.

52:09.876 --> 52:10.085
Thank you.

52:29.312 --> 52:30.397
It's been a while.

52:32.983 --> 52:34.025
Me too.

52:37.904 --> 52:40.156
(moaning)

52:52.210 --> 52:54.296
Lots to do
before we leave.

53:01.595 --> 53:03.263
Reporter: (on TV)
Now we caught up with Michael

53:03.346 --> 53:06.182
days before
the Alford plea.

53:06.266 --> 53:09.269
What have the years following
your release been like?

53:09.352 --> 53:11.563
Michael:
Ah, well, they've been,
uh, been good.

53:11.646 --> 53:13.982
You know, I spent some time
with my, my granddaughters

53:14.065 --> 53:17.110
and, uh, traveled about
a bit once they took
my ankle monitor off.

53:17.193 --> 53:19.529
Sophie Brussard:
Don't you get tired
of watching yourself?

53:19.613 --> 53:22.407
Come on! You can pack
and watch TV.

53:22.490 --> 53:24.784
Reporter:
...when an investigation
into the SBI

53:24.868 --> 53:26.703
allowed Peterson's
defense to argue

53:26.786 --> 53:29.623
that a key witness,
SBI agent Duane Deaver,

53:29.706 --> 53:31.249
perjured himself
on the stand.

53:31.333 --> 53:31.666
A retrial was granted...

53:31.750 --> 53:34.794
Did you pack it?

53:34.878 --> 53:36.755
-What?
-My passport. I can't find it.

53:38.548 --> 53:40.634
Reporter:
And they decided
that the best route

53:40.717 --> 53:41.968
was an Alford plea.

53:42.052 --> 53:43.219
Michael: (on TV)
I wanted to go on fighting.

53:43.303 --> 53:46.473
The last thing I ever wanted

53:46.556 --> 53:47.182
was to say the word.

53:49.726 --> 53:51.561
-But...
-Where'd you put it?

53:52.812 --> 53:54.773
Hmm? I didn't
put it anywhere.

53:56.274 --> 53:57.192
Michael: (on TV)
But I'm 73.

53:59.319 --> 54:02.781
I have to think of
the time I have left.

54:05.325 --> 54:07.994
And the risk of losing
was too great, so...

54:08.078 --> 54:10.580
Reporter: You spent
eight years in prison.

54:10.664 --> 54:11.498
What was that like?

54:11.581 --> 54:14.501
Michael:
The experience of prison is

54:14.584 --> 54:17.754
possibly even more
dehumanizing than...

54:17.837 --> 54:20.590
-It was next to the bed.
-...the experience
of going to war.

54:20.674 --> 54:22.258
Reporter:
So...

54:22.342 --> 54:24.386
I notice you're still
wearing a wedding ring.

54:25.512 --> 54:27.555
Hmm. Yeah.

54:27.639 --> 54:29.724
Reporter: Is she still
a part of your life.

54:29.808 --> 54:31.017
Oh yes.

54:31.101 --> 54:34.062
I, I think about
Kathleen every day,

54:34.145 --> 54:35.522
all the time.

54:35.605 --> 54:37.440
I can be standing
in the kitchen here

54:37.524 --> 54:38.274
and think she's
just going to walk

54:38.358 --> 54:40.402
through that door
any moment.

54:44.864 --> 54:46.324
Well, Jim, for now,

54:46.408 --> 54:46.908
it looks like
Michael's content

54:46.992 --> 54:48.243
living a solitary life

54:48.326 --> 54:50.328
-and being a grandfather--
-(TV switches off)

54:50.412 --> 54:52.038
Come on,
let's get to it.

54:52.122 --> 54:54.040
Will you just give me a minute
to catch my breath.

54:56.084 --> 54:57.711
Jesus.

54:57.794 --> 54:58.712
What's wrong with you?

55:01.631 --> 55:03.049
I'm just tired.
I'm sorry.

55:04.134 --> 55:04.259
I'm sorry.

55:17.272 --> 55:19.858
Maybe you want to go on
tomorrow without me.

55:21.067 --> 55:23.194
I'll just come
on my own later.

55:24.029 --> 55:27.073
Go to Paris without you?

55:28.158 --> 55:29.743
-Michael: Yeah.
-No!

55:29.826 --> 55:31.036
I don't want that.

55:31.119 --> 55:33.038
Well, I need a second.

55:33.121 --> 55:35.999
You know, this is all
happening so fast, too fast.

55:36.082 --> 55:37.459
Too fast?

55:47.260 --> 55:48.470
Do you not want to go?

55:53.058 --> 55:56.936
God, I'm just too tired to pack.

55:57.020 --> 55:59.481
I'll finish up
packing here this week.

56:01.566 --> 56:03.401
Let's just relax
and enjoy the night, huh?

56:04.360 --> 56:05.278
I can't just rush off.

56:07.197 --> 56:10.784
We've been planning this
for months, for years.

56:10.867 --> 56:13.203
So what's
another week then?

56:15.038 --> 56:16.414
If you don't want
to move to Paris...

56:17.540 --> 56:18.625
that's fine.

56:20.210 --> 56:21.419
Just tell me.

56:25.924 --> 56:27.717
No, it's not that
I don't want to go.

56:28.885 --> 56:32.639
I'm just worried about
leaving my kids, my grandkids.

56:32.722 --> 56:35.058
-You know,
they still need me here.
-Your children?

56:35.141 --> 56:36.226
(scoffs)

56:36.309 --> 56:38.728
They don't need you
anymore.

56:38.812 --> 56:39.854
Clearly.

56:41.231 --> 56:42.816
They didn't
even come today.

56:47.737 --> 56:48.738
(sniffles)

56:48.822 --> 56:49.489
(clattering)

56:52.283 --> 56:53.827
I told them not to come.

56:53.910 --> 56:55.620
You didn't have
to tell them anything.

56:58.081 --> 57:00.583
You know, in that
interview, they asked,

57:00.667 --> 57:02.669
"What have you been
doing since prison?"

57:04.671 --> 57:09.467
You say everything
but being with me.

57:09.551 --> 57:11.594
What about me traveling
with your family?

57:11.678 --> 57:13.221
What about me
taking care of you?

57:13.304 --> 57:15.348
You keep saying
this bullshit

57:15.431 --> 57:18.518
about Kathleen walking
through the door?

57:18.601 --> 57:20.353
I walk through the door,
not her.

57:20.436 --> 57:21.855
Those people don't need
to know my business.

57:21.938 --> 57:22.397
What do you care
if I mention you?

57:22.480 --> 57:24.315
I'm the editor, not you.

57:24.399 --> 57:25.024
-Oh! Oh.
-Okay?

57:25.108 --> 57:26.860
I can edit me out
if I want.

57:26.943 --> 57:28.153
You don't edit me.

57:28.236 --> 57:30.697
So, so that's it, huh?
Control.

57:30.780 --> 57:33.575
You and Kathleen always trying
to control everything.

57:33.658 --> 57:34.868
Sophie:
Control?

57:34.951 --> 57:36.703
I've been taking care of you

57:36.786 --> 57:38.913
like Kathleen
took care of you.

57:38.997 --> 57:42.041
You always act like
you know everything about me.

57:42.125 --> 57:44.961
I had a whole life
before that documentary

57:45.044 --> 57:46.588
that you know nothing about.

57:49.174 --> 57:51.801
-Are you coming
with me tomorrow?
-I'm not.

57:56.806 --> 58:00.310
You're the one who said
you, you wanted Paris.

58:00.393 --> 58:03.146
Paris, Paris,
Paris, Paris, Paris.

58:03.229 --> 58:06.858
-Shut up.
-I've given you everything
I had. Everything!

58:06.941 --> 58:08.902
I built my life
around you!

58:08.985 --> 58:10.028
Michael:
Jesus. Shut up.

58:11.738 --> 58:12.906
For what?

58:13.531 --> 58:15.408
For what?

58:15.491 --> 58:18.828
I don't wanna fucking live
with women anymore, okay?

58:18.912 --> 58:20.371
Is that so hard
for you to understand?

58:20.455 --> 58:20.580
I'm done!

58:22.457 --> 58:23.833
I am fucking done!

58:39.224 --> 58:40.433
Did you ever love me?

58:42.894 --> 58:44.729
I don't know.

58:48.399 --> 58:50.068
-I don't know.
-(Sophie sobs)

58:53.738 --> 58:54.864
Michael: It's okay.

58:55.865 --> 58:57.158
Sophie...

58:57.242 --> 58:58.660
(keys jingling)

58:59.994 --> 59:01.996
-I'll...
-Sophie.

59:03.665 --> 59:05.959
(door opens, closes)

59:09.671 --> 59:11.631
Jean:
What is it you wanted
to talk about, Michael?

59:13.174 --> 59:15.301
Michael:
Baseball.

59:16.636 --> 59:17.470
Jean:
Baseball?

59:18.263 --> 59:20.390
Don't worry
about the time.

59:21.432 --> 59:23.434
Why are we really
sitting here, Michael?

59:25.395 --> 59:27.814
I used to play baseball
when I was 11 or 12.

59:29.357 --> 59:33.403
And one night, I was
fantasizing about this girl,

59:33.486 --> 59:35.321
my neighbor's daughter,
Melanie,

59:35.405 --> 59:39.158
and suddenly he was there
in that fantasy.

59:39.242 --> 59:41.119
And I was
very confused by that.

59:41.202 --> 59:42.912
I mean, we played
on the same ball team.

59:42.996 --> 59:44.664
Jean:
Wait, wait, who was there?

59:46.082 --> 59:46.541
The shortstop.

59:48.710 --> 59:51.963
At that moment,
I realized that I had

59:52.046 --> 59:54.048
a great attraction
for, for females,

59:54.132 --> 59:58.219
but for guys also.

59:58.303 --> 1:00:00.972
And that that was something
I was going to have to hide.

1:00:01.055 --> 1:00:03.308
Jean:
Did your parents find out?

1:00:03.391 --> 1:00:05.143
One night,
my father found us,

1:00:06.436 --> 1:00:08.521
just, you know,
experimenting.

1:00:11.482 --> 1:00:12.525
He got so mad.

1:00:16.612 --> 1:00:17.363
Violent.

1:00:17.447 --> 1:00:20.533
I remember sitting
in our car

1:00:20.616 --> 1:00:22.869
outside the garage
listening to the radio.

1:00:25.538 --> 1:00:27.582
Just me, my mother,

1:00:27.665 --> 1:00:28.958
Mahler's Fifth Symphony,

1:00:29.542 --> 1:00:31.294
and my black eye.

1:00:32.712 --> 1:00:34.088
After that, I knew
it was easier to lie.

1:00:34.172 --> 1:00:36.257
It was safer.

1:00:38.134 --> 1:00:38.968
Jean:
Is that it?

1:00:40.303 --> 1:00:42.388
Is there something else
you wanted to say?

1:00:45.975 --> 1:00:47.185
I always felt

1:00:48.269 --> 1:00:50.229
there was something
you were holding back

1:00:50.313 --> 1:00:52.565
during the first trial.

1:00:52.648 --> 1:00:55.568
I don't know what,
but there was something.

1:00:59.113 --> 1:01:00.698
I was. There is.

1:01:06.162 --> 1:01:07.497
I lied about Kathleen.

1:01:08.206 --> 1:01:10.416
She never knew.

1:01:13.294 --> 1:01:14.796
I never told her
about that side of me.

1:01:15.922 --> 1:01:18.591
You know, in the beginning
when people asked,

1:01:18.674 --> 1:01:21.219
you know, "Did she know
about the men?"

1:01:21.302 --> 1:01:23.805
I, I told them,
"Of course, she did.

1:01:23.888 --> 1:01:25.014
She knew me."

1:01:27.308 --> 1:01:28.643
And I'd hoped
that would be enough.

1:01:28.726 --> 1:01:32.021
But then people ask
again and again, so...

1:01:35.900 --> 1:01:40.029
But no, no,
we never talked about... it.

1:01:42.657 --> 1:01:46.119
I could never make
the leap to say to her,

1:01:46.994 --> 1:01:49.038
"This is who I am."

1:01:51.916 --> 1:01:54.168
To make that leap is,
is very difficult and...

1:01:55.837 --> 1:01:56.671
I didn't make
the leap with Kathleen.

1:01:59.590 --> 1:02:02.468
I'm sure I felt guilty,
you know.

1:02:05.388 --> 1:02:06.764
But when you get away
with something

1:02:06.848 --> 1:02:08.641
and you keep
getting away with it,

1:02:08.724 --> 1:02:11.477
it becomes,
"Oh, it's alright,"

1:02:11.561 --> 1:02:11.686
you see?

1:02:14.272 --> 1:02:15.648
I wish I could have
told her.

1:02:17.191 --> 1:02:18.568
I wonder what
she would have said.

1:02:20.570 --> 1:02:22.864
She'd have made it right.

1:02:27.034 --> 1:02:28.286
Jean:
Did you kill Kathleen?

1:02:34.584 --> 1:02:37.378
Kathleen's death
was an accident.

1:02:43.301 --> 1:02:44.635
(sighs)

1:02:48.014 --> 1:02:49.390
This man...

1:02:51.058 --> 1:02:52.810
this man is a liar.

1:02:52.894 --> 1:02:55.313
He lied about everything.
Everything!

1:02:57.773 --> 1:02:59.984
The whole time he lied.

1:03:00.067 --> 1:03:02.195
Yes, he did, but maybe
this is him trying to stop.

1:03:02.278 --> 1:03:04.030
You really think so?

1:03:08.326 --> 1:03:11.329
(breathing heavily)

1:03:18.961 --> 1:03:20.338
I don't know...

1:03:22.798 --> 1:03:24.550
what to think.

1:03:27.512 --> 1:03:28.721
I don't know.

1:03:33.559 --> 1:03:34.810
But, I know...

1:03:37.021 --> 1:03:37.855
you will be happier
without him.

1:03:44.987 --> 1:03:45.821
Jean...

1:03:49.367 --> 1:03:49.909
He didn't.

1:03:54.163 --> 1:03:56.582
He couldn't.

Hey, Mom. Hey, Mike.

1:04:09.929 --> 1:04:10.763
I'm starting to get packed up
to see you guys soon.

1:04:10.846 --> 1:04:12.557
Um, I was thinking
of driving down

1:04:12.640 --> 1:04:13.808
if the weather
wasn't so bad

1:04:13.891 --> 1:04:16.102
and maybe seeing
some friends on the way.

1:04:16.185 --> 1:04:19.021
But anyway, I can't wait
to see you guys for Christmas.

1:04:19.105 --> 1:04:20.773

Hey, Kathleen.
Sorry to call so late,

1:04:25.486 --> 1:04:26.904
but we have to do
a conference call tomorrow

1:04:26.988 --> 1:04:28.447
to get on the same page
about Toronto

1:04:28.531 --> 1:04:30.116
before you fly out.

1:04:30.199 --> 1:04:32.785
A work call on the weekend.
It sucks, I know,

1:04:32.868 --> 1:04:35.204

the presentation.
