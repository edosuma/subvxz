00:19.185 --> 00:21.855
Here is the thing called ferdali.

00:21.938 --> 00:25.525
Its local name is perdeli (curtains).

00:26.192 --> 00:31.114
It's the forefather
of the dish called kebab.

00:33.033 --> 00:37.287
But it's not like other kebabs.
It's made with a single skewer.

00:41.708 --> 00:46.463
<i>Kebab has existed in Istanbul even prior</i>
<i>to the proclamation of the republic,</i>

00:47.130 --> 00:49.466
<i>200-250 years.</i>

00:50.633 --> 00:55.263
<i>But around the time I opened</i>
<i>Çiya Kebab, in the '80s,</i>

00:55.930 --> 00:58.600
<i>foods such as kebab</i>

00:58.683 --> 01:04.439
were made objects of ridicule in movies
and everywhere else.

01:06.274 --> 01:09.694
<i>It was considered food consumed</i>

01:09.778 --> 01:13.615
<i>by people without culture.</i>

01:15.825 --> 01:22.290
<i>I was disturbed by the profiling of people</i>
<i>as cultured and uncultured.</i>

01:26.628 --> 01:30.715
<i>I had to do something about it.</i>

01:35.220 --> 01:38.932
<i>I had the idea to play classical music</i>
<i>in the restaurant.</i>

01:54.364 --> 01:59.452
<i>People would eat kebab in the restaurant</i>
<i>listening to </i>Carmina Burana <i>or Chopin.</i>

02:03.206 --> 02:05.667
<i>Slowly, people from a variety</i>
<i>of different backgrounds</i>

02:05.750 --> 02:07.544
<i>started to come into the restaurant.</i>

02:09.838 --> 02:14.634
<i>And they were discussing culture</i>
<i>while eating kebab.</i>

02:23.101 --> 02:25.687
<i>Culture has nothing to do with</i>
<i>being educated,</i>

02:27.897 --> 02:32.944
<i>or being a doctor or being a lawyer.</i>

02:36.322 --> 02:38.408
<i>What a villager lives...</i>

02:38.491 --> 02:40.243
<i>What a shepherd lives...</i>

02:41.119 --> 02:42.162
<i>This is also culture.</i>

02:44.622 --> 02:48.251
Culture is what everyone lives.

06:37.271 --> 06:38.523
Hello, everyone.

06:39.982 --> 06:41.442
How's everything going?

06:44.862 --> 06:46.280
I think it's like that.

06:49.575 --> 06:50.993
How is school going?

06:51.077 --> 06:52.620
It's good. I've graduated.

06:52.703 --> 06:55.248
What does the school teach you?

06:55.331 --> 06:58.042
Basic information,

06:58.126 --> 07:03.506
like baking temperatures
for different kinds of flour.

07:04.006 --> 07:10.555
Do they teach you what silkme is?

07:10.638 --> 07:14.851
-No.
-Do they teach Turkish cooking techniques?

07:14.934 --> 07:20.857
Not really, only the main dishes,
like dolmas.

07:21.357 --> 07:23.443
What about regional cuisines?

07:23.526 --> 07:27.363
We study them region by region.

07:27.864 --> 07:30.158
Which region is this from?

07:32.577 --> 07:33.995
I don't know.

07:35.746 --> 07:39.208
It is from Kayseri.

07:39.292 --> 07:42.795
It's called dizme manti.

07:48.092 --> 07:51.888
<i>I've always felt my country</i>
<i>has this problem:</i>

07:52.388 --> 07:55.850
<i>People always want to say,</i>

07:55.933 --> 07:58.603
<i>"This is Kurdish food, Greek food,</i>
<i>Armenian food."</i>

07:59.437 --> 08:04.984
<i>When you define food in ethnic terms,</i>
<i>it sets communities against each other</i>

08:05.985 --> 08:12.200
<i>and can create a serious alienation</i>
<i>and extinction of our food culture.</i>

08:20.374 --> 08:23.961
<i>The local food culture varies</i>
<i>greatly all over Turkey,</i>

08:24.045 --> 08:27.882
<i>and it has such rich characteristics.</i>

08:31.010 --> 08:34.305
<i>This is what we should be focusing on.</i>

08:40.561 --> 08:44.273
<i>Humans are carriers in the world.</i>

08:47.568 --> 08:51.155
<i>They carry culture.</i>
<i>They carry food, music, electricity...</i>

08:56.035 --> 09:01.415
We must acquire the traditions
from the carriers of our culture,

09:03.459 --> 09:08.548
<i>and celebrate our rich diversity</i>
<i>in a way that unites us.</i>

09:26.148 --> 09:29.860
Auntie! What were you doing
when there was no mincing machine?

09:29.944 --> 09:35.658
We did it very slowly with two knives.

09:36.158 --> 09:38.035
Did the men help?

09:38.119 --> 09:41.831
Come on. No way.

09:43.374 --> 09:48.087
<i>I am the youngest of six siblings:</i>
<i>one girl and five boys.</i>

09:49.463 --> 09:51.882
<i>Being the youngest,</i>

09:51.966 --> 09:54.635
<i>nobody listens to you.</i>
<i>You don't get to talk.</i>

09:55.136 --> 09:56.429
<i>You hear things like,</i>

09:56.512 --> 09:59.974
"Keep quiet! You're a kid.
You aren't a grown-up yet."

10:01.309 --> 10:02.476
Be careful.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.353
Or you will get an owie.

10:06.272 --> 10:11.611
<i>But when I compare myself to my siblings,</i>
<i>I was luckier.</i>

10:12.361 --> 10:15.031
<i>I was with my mom more often.</i>

10:21.662 --> 10:26.792
<i>I was able to learn</i>
<i>nearly all the traditions and customs</i>

10:26.876 --> 10:29.378
<i>of the region we lived in from my mom.</i>

10:32.923 --> 10:36.427
<i>My mom used to prepare</i>
<i>greasy dumplings as an appetizer.</i>

10:42.683 --> 10:46.354
<i>I used to steal some</i>
<i>while she was working,</i>

10:46.437 --> 10:50.191
and she would slap my wrist.
She used to say, "Be patient."

10:52.860 --> 10:56.697
<i>It had an extraordinary taste.</i>

10:59.825 --> 11:05.998
<i>My mother said,</i>
<i>"Your siblings don't see what you see.</i>

11:07.750 --> 11:10.086
<i>You are the seed.</i>

11:13.464 --> 11:16.258
<i>You're going to keep our traditions alive.</i>

11:17.635 --> 11:19.887
<i>This is your duty."</i>

11:49.041 --> 11:50.584
Let's taste a piece.

11:52.545 --> 11:57.633
Does the tradition of stealing a piece
of the best lahmacun continue?

11:59.218 --> 12:01.387
Not anymore. Not anymore.

12:02.263 --> 12:05.057
We never take anything without
the customer's permission, brother.

12:05.141 --> 12:08.227
We used to steal from the stingy ones.

12:12.898 --> 12:15.276
<i>I didn't grow up in a wealthy family.</i>

12:16.026 --> 12:19.905
<i>So, as a kid,</i>
<i>I was taught not to waste anything</i>

12:20.656 --> 12:25.286
and to know the value
of every little thing.

12:33.461 --> 12:37.965
<i>From the time I was five or six years old,</i>
<i>I used to work at my uncles' bakery.</i>

12:42.178 --> 12:44.638
<i>Rich people would buy meat</i>
<i>from the butcher</i>

12:44.722 --> 12:47.808
<i>and bring the meat to the bakery.</i>

12:48.642 --> 12:51.061
<i>That meat would get cooked at the bakery.</i>

12:56.150 --> 12:59.153
<i>At some point, when no one was looking,</i>

12:59.236 --> 13:02.448
<i>the baker's helper would take</i>
<i>the leftover fat from the meat,</i>

13:03.240 --> 13:07.036
<i>spread it over the newly baked bread,</i>

13:07.119 --> 13:08.662
<i>and eat it.</i>

13:14.710 --> 13:19.340
<i>It's much more delicious than the meat.</i>

13:28.349 --> 13:31.727
<i>A rich person can buy what they want.</i>

13:34.104 --> 13:36.607
<i>A poor person makes their wealth</i>

13:36.690 --> 13:41.987
by means of creativity.

13:52.957 --> 13:57.419
We'll pick peppers and sunflowers.

13:58.546 --> 14:04.552
Half of us will pick red peppers,
and half will pick green.

14:09.306 --> 14:10.641
Like this, for kebab.

14:10.724 --> 14:12.017
Yes, very nice.

14:16.605 --> 14:19.608
These look ready to pick.

14:25.155 --> 14:27.575
<i>I spent my youth living in Nizip.</i>

14:29.326 --> 14:34.665
<i>People in Nizip were never defined</i>
<i>by their religious or political beliefs.</i>

14:35.666 --> 14:38.335
They never say, "Your ethnicity is that.

14:38.419 --> 14:42.131
You belong to this denomination
or your nationality is that."

14:42.715 --> 14:44.133
We were just people from Nizip.

14:47.678 --> 14:54.351
<i>But when I was 12,</i>
<i>there was a military coup in my country.</i>

14:58.105 --> 15:02.776
<i>People started to kill each other</i>
<i>for having different beliefs.</i>

15:03.944 --> 15:05.154
<i>It was scary.</i>

15:11.285 --> 15:15.289
<i>In the house where we lived,</i>
<i>everybody took turns keeping vigil.</i>

15:21.086 --> 15:26.759
<i>It became unbearable.</i>

15:38.479 --> 15:40.189
<i>All these things were happening,</i>

15:40.272 --> 15:42.858
<i>and I was questioning</i>
<i>why they were happening.</i>

15:44.902 --> 15:47.529
<i>So, I started to read.</i>

16:07.508 --> 16:12.137
<i>That's when I started learning about</i>
<i>what fascism is, what communism is,</i>

16:12.221 --> 16:14.640
<i>what democracy is...</i>

16:20.312 --> 16:23.190
<i>In a way, it was as if the curtain</i>
<i>in front of my eyes was lifted.</i>

16:33.367 --> 16:40.332
<i>To exist in society,</i>
<i>you must choose a side.</i>

16:49.383 --> 16:54.346
<i>So, I decided I was going to fight</i>
<i>for the things I believed in.</i>

17:08.694 --> 17:10.946
-Give it to uncle.
-Thanks a lot.

17:19.455 --> 17:23.917
<i>In Nizip, bakeries are vital</i>
<i>for the food culture.</i>

17:27.212 --> 17:33.093
<i>There were 40 bakeries in Nizip,</i>
<i>including the one I worked in.</i>

17:34.970 --> 17:38.098
<i>None of the bakers had been able</i>
<i>to get health insurance.</i>

17:39.224 --> 17:41.268
<i>This bothered me.</i>

17:44.229 --> 17:47.024
<i>So, a few of us started a union.</i>

17:52.613 --> 17:55.949
<i>We visited all of the bakeries,</i>
<i>one by one,</i>

17:56.033 --> 17:59.787
<i>and convinced the employees</i>
<i>that this was important to them,</i>

18:00.287 --> 18:02.790
<i>and we decided to go on strike.</i>

18:10.506 --> 18:14.676
<i>Everyone really struggled.</i>
<i>No one got paid.</i>

18:21.391 --> 18:24.436
<i>The police threatened us,</i>

18:25.145 --> 18:29.691
<i>saying we would be killed</i>
<i>if we didn't stay quiet.</i>

18:36.448 --> 18:38.492
<i>But we continued.</i>

18:41.995 --> 18:44.623
<i>This strike went on for 40 days.</i>

18:47.960 --> 18:50.754
<i>After those 40 days,</i>

18:51.255 --> 18:53.257
<i>they agreed to our demands.</i>

18:59.221 --> 19:01.265
<i>I had a strong political stance.</i>

19:02.766 --> 19:06.562
<i>And I was able to express it.</i>

19:37.342 --> 19:41.054
First, we make the spoon
out of a bay leaf.

19:41.138 --> 19:43.140
We split the leaf.

19:45.267 --> 19:48.812
This is what a shepherd eats at noon.

19:49.313 --> 19:53.400
He gathers his friends
and other shepherds.

19:53.483 --> 19:56.111
They sit together.

19:56.195 --> 19:57.571
They eat together.

19:58.155 --> 20:03.035
Everybody brings their goats.
They have their bowls on their belts.

20:03.118 --> 20:07.539
They take out their bread and figs.
They have everything on their belts.

20:07.623 --> 20:10.334
-This is their lunch.
-Great.

20:12.544 --> 20:13.670
Let's find a goat.

20:22.012 --> 20:23.805
Now, to make teleme,

20:24.389 --> 20:26.475
our ingredients, our figs...

20:27.142 --> 20:29.311
inside the bowl.

20:37.152 --> 20:40.072
It is the fig sap that ferments the milk.

20:45.577 --> 20:47.996
Come on. Let's spoon up.

20:48.622 --> 20:49.957
Magnificent.

20:50.499 --> 20:51.667
This is for one?

20:51.750 --> 20:53.919
In the past, this wouldn't be enough
for one shepherd.

20:54.002 --> 20:57.256
-Big copper bowls, right?
-The old bowls were made out of copper,

20:57.756 --> 21:02.302
because a shepherd has friends every day.

21:03.929 --> 21:05.305
There is nothing like this.

21:22.906 --> 21:24.950
My mom used to make it like this.

21:26.743 --> 21:27.786
You take it from the top.

21:28.370 --> 21:30.122
That's how we dried eggplant
back in the day.

21:30.622 --> 21:35.377
If we worked that long
on a single eggplant, we'd lose our job.

21:41.425 --> 21:45.554
<i>Leaving Nizip was never something</i>
<i>I even thought of.</i>

21:48.265 --> 21:54.771
<i>But after the bakery strike,</i>
<i>there were real dangers to my life.</i>

21:57.274 --> 21:59.693
<i>So, I had to flee Nizip.</i>

22:02.404 --> 22:04.573
<i>And that's why I came to Istanbul.</i>

22:19.046 --> 22:22.674
<i>At first, I experienced some kind</i>
<i>of a culture shock.</i>

22:26.887 --> 22:29.598
<i>It was an enormous city, full of people.</i>

22:37.564 --> 22:42.569
<i>I noticed differences in restaurants</i>
<i>from one neighborhood to another.</i>

22:45.947 --> 22:52.662
<i>Restaurants run by Albanians,</i>
<i>Armenians, Circassians.</i>

22:55.916 --> 22:59.294
<i>People came from all over Turkey</i>
<i>to Istanbul...</i>

23:00.504 --> 23:05.801
<i>and they brought all of the richness</i>
<i>from their regions.</i>

23:05.884 --> 23:10.013
<i>And those differences</i>
<i>made Istanbul colorful.</i>

23:26.988 --> 23:32.160
<i>I slowly began to feel this richness</i>
<i>as a part of who I was.</i>

23:46.299 --> 23:50.095
One side is too thin. It's not equal.

23:55.100 --> 23:58.186
Who did this, Oguzhan? Send him here.

23:58.854 --> 24:02.232
Next time, do it even.

24:05.360 --> 24:10.157
Look, wait a minute. Do it like this.

24:28.717 --> 24:32.012
<i>After I arrived in Istanbul,</i>
<i>I needed a job.</i>

24:33.388 --> 24:35.265
<i>My uncle had a restaurant.</i>

24:36.433 --> 24:37.893
So that's where I started to work.

24:48.612 --> 24:50.405
<i>I was experienced as a baker.</i>

24:51.907 --> 24:55.619
<i>But I was interested in</i>
<i>all the other aspects of the restaurant.</i>

25:00.165 --> 25:04.544
<i>I started learning their way of working,</i>
<i>what they were serving.</i>

25:06.463 --> 25:09.758
<i>If the cooks who made the cold dishes</i>
<i>or the kebabs weren't in,</i>

25:09.841 --> 25:10.884
<i>I would get very happy,</i>

25:10.967 --> 25:13.136
because this would mean that I would
get a chance to make them.

25:16.348 --> 25:21.144
<i>Everybody would admire my work,</i>
<i>but I'd say the cooks prepared it.</i>

25:22.270 --> 25:26.358
<i>Otherwise, they would've gotten</i>
<i>a scolding for not doing their job.</i>

25:29.653 --> 25:34.532
<i>Being a part of the kitchen</i>
<i>was truly exhilarating.</i>

25:50.173 --> 25:53.009
<i>My interest in cooking grew,</i>

25:53.760 --> 25:56.846
<i>and I knew I wanted to be a chef.</i>

26:21.788 --> 26:23.290
Chef Mustafa?

26:24.249 --> 26:26.793
Shall we make today's menu?

26:31.339 --> 26:35.635
Zucchini, beans, okra and meat are ready.

26:35.719 --> 26:40.598
Okay, let's start with potato soup, then.

26:40.682 --> 26:42.851
Kartol soup.

26:46.354 --> 26:49.899
<i>In Turkey,</i>
<i>all men have to serve in the military.</i>

26:51.651 --> 26:55.113
<i>I joined the military in 1983.</i>

26:57.073 --> 27:01.077
<i>Since I was a cook and a baker,</i>
<i>I was taken aside.</i>

27:02.078 --> 27:06.374
<i>And they put me on cook duty</i>
<i>at the regiment in Ezine.</i>

27:13.214 --> 27:19.637
<i>The first thing I noticed was</i>
<i>they weren't using good techniques.</i>

27:21.514 --> 27:26.603
<i>They put all the ingredients</i>
<i>in one big pot.</i>

27:28.229 --> 27:30.565
So, the food had a weird color.

27:33.068 --> 27:35.070
<i>It came out mainly looking like mud.</i>

27:38.615 --> 27:43.870
<i>Everybody in the regiment would curse</i>
<i>at us, saying this meal is terrible.</i>

27:47.707 --> 27:52.170
I told my boss, Mustafa,
"This isn't the right way to do this."

27:53.838 --> 27:55.840
<i>I told him that I would change this.</i>

27:56.841 --> 28:03.306
<i>He said, "You won't be able to.</i>
<i>There are over 2,000 hungry men."</i>

28:04.224 --> 28:05.767
<i>I said I would give it a shot.</i>

28:09.270 --> 28:10.397
Hello, everyone.

28:12.816 --> 28:17.737
<i>So, the next day,</i>
<i>I boiled the beans in a copper boiler.</i>

28:19.406 --> 28:22.492
<i>Then the meat was sautéed</i>
<i>in a separate copper boiler.</i>

28:23.201 --> 28:26.162
<i>The onions were sautéed,</i>
<i>along with the tomato paste.</i>

28:29.082 --> 28:34.295
<i>At the end, everything was cooked together</i>
<i>in the broth.</i>

28:38.383 --> 28:42.554
<i>And with this, something new started.</i>

28:46.850 --> 28:50.812
Look, it says, "Eat me."

28:52.397 --> 28:55.567
<i>The same people</i>
<i>who would leave after a spoonful</i>

28:55.650 --> 28:58.278
<i>were now coming back for a second serving.</i>

28:59.779 --> 29:02.782
Before, the food was getting thrown away.

29:02.866 --> 29:06.244
Now, people started to complain
that there wasn't enough.

29:07.620 --> 29:08.872
There wasn't enough.

29:34.272 --> 29:36.691
How is the handled one's durability
with wood-fired ovens?

29:36.775 --> 29:38.401
You can't break these.

29:38.485 --> 29:44.282
I swear to God, we have some cooks
who can break steel.

29:44.365 --> 29:47.243
The cast iron ones may break when dropped.

29:47.327 --> 29:51.206
This one is brass.
It is made of the strongest stuff.

29:55.960 --> 29:58.004
-I could engrave here.
-Yes, that's better.

29:58.087 --> 29:59.964
It's better. Great.

30:00.048 --> 30:01.007
Right.

30:02.884 --> 30:04.928
<i>When I got back from the military,</i>

30:05.553 --> 30:07.764
<i>I decided to open up Çiya Kebab.</i>

30:10.475 --> 30:12.602
<i>It wasn't easy.</i>

30:14.896 --> 30:17.857
<i>I had to work day and night.</i>

30:19.025 --> 30:22.487
I was sleeping in the restaurant
on the chairs,

30:22.570 --> 30:26.616
wrapping my shoes in paper or my apron,
sleeping on them.

30:29.828 --> 30:31.371
<i>I needed help.</i>

30:32.455 --> 30:34.374
<i>And that help was Zeynep.</i>

30:44.884 --> 30:49.681
<i>I went to Çiya for lunch one day.</i>

30:50.723 --> 30:53.685
We said that we wanted oruk.

30:53.768 --> 30:57.230
But the waiter replied,
"It isn't called oruk."

30:57.313 --> 31:00.149
I insisted that it was oruk.

31:04.571 --> 31:09.492
<i>I stop the waiter. I ask her,</i>
<i>"Madam, where are you from?"</i>

31:10.243 --> 31:11.536
She says, "Antakya."

31:11.619 --> 31:17.584
I told the waiter that she was right.
People of Antakya call içli köfte "oruk."

31:17.667 --> 31:19.878
So, she was right.

31:22.714 --> 31:27.552
<i>There wasn't too much romance</i>
<i>between us in the beginning.</i>

31:28.177 --> 31:33.892
Musa's romanticism involved food,
food and food! Nothing else!

31:37.520 --> 31:42.609
<i>She offered a friendly helping hand</i>
<i>at the restaurant.</i>

31:44.319 --> 31:46.696
<i>We were together every moment,</i>
<i>all the time.</i>

31:47.280 --> 31:50.491
<i>We had fun together, laughed together,</i>
<i>created together.</i>

31:52.702 --> 31:57.248
<i>Then this friendship</i>
<i>turned into this thing.</i>

32:07.842 --> 32:11.930
What would have happened
if we didn't meet?

32:14.182 --> 32:15.224
I don't know.

32:16.476 --> 32:17.727
<i>If Çiya exists today,</i>

32:18.311 --> 32:20.688
<i>it does so</i>
<i>not only because of Musa Dağdeviren.</i>

32:20.772 --> 32:23.650
<i>It's because of Zeynep's</i>
<i>incredible contributions.</i>

32:27.904 --> 32:31.074
<i>Çiya became the fruit of our love.</i>

32:48.591 --> 32:53.054
<i>In the '90s, there were</i>
<i>a lot of political problems in Turkey.</i>

32:54.764 --> 32:57.558
<i>Istanbul became polarized.</i>

33:00.812 --> 33:05.066
<i>In essence, it caused</i>
<i>you-versus-me fights.</i>

33:09.862 --> 33:12.824
<i>At that time, a customer came in</i>
<i>with his friend.</i>

33:16.119 --> 33:18.871
The customer said,
"This is Kurdish food.

33:19.539 --> 33:22.709
I don't eat Kurdish food."

33:25.169 --> 33:26.921
<i>And they left.</i>

33:34.178 --> 33:39.142
<i>People made condescending remarks</i>
<i>about different food cultures...</i>

33:45.481 --> 33:48.234
<i>saying things like,</i>
<i>"I don't eat at a Sunni's restaurant.</i>

33:50.653 --> 33:54.323
<i>I don't eat at an Armenian's restaurant.</i>

33:57.035 --> 33:59.746
<i>I don't eat at a Turk's restaurant."</i>

34:04.375 --> 34:06.210
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

34:07.587 --> 34:09.839
<i>This food is from your own country.</i>

34:14.969 --> 34:17.930
<i>Now they were rejecting these cultures.</i>

34:29.692 --> 34:35.990
<i>The colorfulness of Istanbul was</i>
<i>what reminded us of our cultural richness.</i>

34:38.159 --> 34:41.079
<i>But now the restaurants</i>
<i>which showcased our diversity...</i>

34:42.330 --> 34:43.539
<i>were disappearing.</i>

35:15.780 --> 35:19.867
<i>I decided to take a trip home to Nizip.</i>

35:22.036 --> 35:26.249
<i>I needed to be reminded of the richness</i>
<i>of my culture firsthand.</i>

35:29.168 --> 35:32.004
<i>When I got back,</i>
<i>I wanted to eat greasy dumplings.</i>

35:33.131 --> 35:35.341
<i>But I soon realized the greasy dumpling</i>

35:35.424 --> 35:38.094
<i>was not known by the people</i>
<i>in the region anymore.</i>

35:39.345 --> 35:41.472
<i>I couldn't even see its traces.</i>

35:55.611 --> 36:00.825
<i>I had observed our food culture</i>
<i>disappearing in Istanbul.</i>

36:03.119 --> 36:05.788
<i>But in Nizip, where I was born and raised,</i>

36:06.664 --> 36:08.833
<i>I thought they were</i>
<i>preserving our culture.</i>

36:18.759 --> 36:21.929
<i>In my heart,</i>
<i>that dish was associated with my mom.</i>

36:29.228 --> 36:32.773
<i>This disappearance shook me to my core.</i>

37:24.867 --> 37:26.118
<i>Who is it?</i>

37:26.202 --> 37:28.579
<i>It is me, Aunt Hatice. Musa!</i>

37:28.663 --> 37:29.830
<i>Come in, Musa.</i>

37:30.414 --> 37:31.624
How are you?

37:31.707 --> 37:33.918
I kiss your eyes. Welcome.

37:37.463 --> 37:40.466
-What are we going to do with this?
-Pişik dumplings.

37:43.719 --> 37:46.180
Make it as you always make it.

37:47.932 --> 37:49.767
I make this in the summer...

37:51.102 --> 37:52.478
not in winter,

37:53.271 --> 37:56.440
because there isn't good enough tomato
in the winter time.

37:57.942 --> 37:59.235
Let me have the tomato.

38:03.948 --> 38:05.533
Bless your hands.

38:06.492 --> 38:09.453
These foods are still alive,
thanks to you.

38:10.162 --> 38:12.248
It is my duty.

38:16.627 --> 38:21.882
<i>I realized that I needed to compile</i>
<i>the older generation's knowledge,</i>

38:22.383 --> 38:29.307
<i>so that the next generations will at least</i>
<i>know about the existence of this culture.</i>

38:37.106 --> 38:40.943
<i>I thought I should write a book.</i>

38:47.575 --> 38:49.076
<i>It wasn't going to be a book</i>

38:49.160 --> 38:51.579
<i>prepared by scanning the internet</i>
<i>and googling.</i>

38:52.371 --> 38:56.667
<i>It had to be done through fieldwork.</i>

39:12.058 --> 39:15.603
<i>We decided on about 40 villages.</i>

39:20.232 --> 39:22.485
-Let me see if I can make it.
-Sure you can.

39:22.568 --> 39:24.195
Do I stir like this?

39:25.196 --> 39:29.158
<i>And we visited about 40 villages</i>
<i>over an 18-month period.</i>

39:33.537 --> 39:36.332
-There isn't a word to describe it.
-Enjoy it.

39:36.832 --> 39:37.792
Unbelievably delicious.

39:38.918 --> 39:44.715
<i>There were so many dishes</i>
<i>I didn't know about, nobody knew about!</i>

39:48.219 --> 39:49.220
Almost done.

39:51.222 --> 39:53.391
<i>I was talking to the elderly,</i>

39:53.474 --> 39:58.562
<i>absorbing and internalizing</i>
<i>their histories and life experiences.</i>

40:07.154 --> 40:09.365
<i>I compiled all of this information...</i>

40:12.034 --> 40:14.912
<i>and I returned to Istanbul.</i>

40:33.514 --> 40:37.852
Do you have some purple basil?
Five bundles?

40:37.935 --> 40:38.769
Yes!

40:39.437 --> 40:41.063
-Also give me five bundles of the green.
-Okay.

40:43.315 --> 40:44.900
Are these date palms domestic produce?

40:45.651 --> 40:47.027
Yes, they are.

40:47.111 --> 40:49.488
The date palms come from Alanya region.

40:49.572 --> 40:51.657
Let's have half a kilo.

40:54.076 --> 40:56.745
<i>When Musa came back</i>
<i>from his field studies,</i>

40:56.829 --> 40:59.832
<i>making kebab wasn't satisfactory enough</i>
<i>for him anymore.</i>

41:01.333 --> 41:04.170
At that point,
the shop across us became vacant.

41:06.964 --> 41:11.343
Zeynep said, "Why don't you postpone
this book project?

41:11.844 --> 41:16.056
Instead, let's just implement
your idea over here."

41:17.683 --> 41:20.519
<i>When we first shared this idea</i>
<i>with others,</i>

41:20.603 --> 41:22.271
<i>they told us this was crazy.</i>

41:22.354 --> 41:25.441
<i>They said that people wouldn't like it, </i>

41:26.775 --> 41:30.696
<i>because people didn't know this food.</i>

41:31.530 --> 41:33.324
But we wanted to try it.

41:39.455 --> 41:43.375
<i>We sent 600 invitations out</i>
<i>to Çiya Kebab's customer base.</i>

41:50.591 --> 41:54.470
<i>Musa's mother, my mother,</i>
<i>Musa's big brother, my big sister...</i>

41:54.553 --> 41:57.056
<i>Everybody, in the best way</i>
<i>they could help,</i>

41:57.556 --> 41:58.891
<i>squeezed into that tiny kitchen</i>

41:58.974 --> 42:03.646
<i>and together made all the dishes,</i>
<i>all night long.</i>

42:07.483 --> 42:10.611
<i>The next day,</i>
<i>we had the surprise of a lifetime.</i>

42:11.111 --> 42:14.782
We had to serve 2,500 people that day.

42:23.832 --> 42:26.502
<i>People were flooding in with excitement.</i>

42:28.587 --> 42:30.589
<i>They said, "This is our region's food!"</i>

42:33.092 --> 42:34.760
It was just unbelievable.

42:40.975 --> 42:44.478
<i>People came,</i>
<i>and their purpose wasn't just to eat,</i>

42:45.729 --> 42:51.527
<i>but to feel the acceptance</i>
<i>of their culture's existence.</i>

43:08.752 --> 43:15.467
<i>Çiya's customers were the manifestation</i>
<i>of the food served there.</i>

43:16.510 --> 43:18.929
<i>They're all different.</i>

43:20.931 --> 43:26.854
<i>And they share their different</i>
<i>characteristics at one table.</i>

45:03.033 --> 45:04.660
Now, the gravel bread

45:04.743 --> 45:10.624
is an old method which is done
in many parts of our country.

45:11.208 --> 45:12.584
Look. It's here.

45:15.087 --> 45:16.713
What will we do with this?

45:21.051 --> 45:22.553
We put this into the oven.

45:40.612 --> 45:43.073
-We put it into the gravel?
-Yes.

45:44.950 --> 45:46.493
Is it like that?

45:49.121 --> 45:51.999
-I couldn't do it.
-Don't worry about the gravel.

45:52.082 --> 45:53.041
Look.

45:53.125 --> 45:56.712
Toss it on the gravel like that.

46:11.018 --> 46:13.061
-Folded.
-It's normal.

46:27.534 --> 46:29.661
Here is the gravel bread.

46:30.162 --> 46:33.248
Yours is better than all, even mine.

46:37.211 --> 46:43.634
My mom said I was the seed
for the continuation of our kind.

46:46.470 --> 46:50.390
<i>That's how it started,</i>
<i>and it's been my duty ever since.</i>

46:51.350 --> 46:53.393
<i>But now, the important thing is</i>

46:53.477 --> 46:57.606
that I leave this knowledge
to the next generation.

46:58.982 --> 47:02.402
<i>They are now the carriers of this culture.</i>

47:03.820 --> 47:06.323
Now we will repeat this
at least ten times,

47:07.074 --> 47:09.743
until the day is done.
