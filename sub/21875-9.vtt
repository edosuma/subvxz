Stand over there.

00:15.840 --> 00:16.940
Alrighty.

00:18.150 --> 00:21.850
Well, we're hot
in four, three, two.

00:23.450 --> 00:26.020
This is Tracy Ralston
reporting to you live

00:26.020 --> 00:27.920
outside the Texas state prison

00:27.920 --> 00:30.120
where convicted killer
Woodrow Wilton

00:30.130 --> 00:32.729
is scheduled to be executed
in three days

00:32.729 --> 00:35.760
for the bizarre electrocution
slayings five years ago,

00:35.760 --> 00:37.160
dubbed the
"night shift murders,"

00:37.170 --> 00:40.630
<i> in which women were abducted</i>
<i> late at night</i>

00:40.640 --> 00:42.570

<i> at 24-hour fast-food</i>

00:45.710 --> 00:47.210
Man, this guy's a sicko, huh?

00:47.210 --> 00:49.710
<i> Fifteen women fell victim</i>
<i> to the night shift murderer...</i>

00:49.710 --> 00:52.280
That's what they say.

00:52.280 --> 00:53.880
<i> Against Wilton's wishes,</i>

00:53.880 --> 00:57.820
<i> his lawyers have attempted</i>
<i> a last-ditch stay of execution.</i>

00:57.820 --> 01:00.790
<i> That stay has been denied.</i>

01:00.790 --> 01:04.790
<i> In three days, Woodrow Wilton</i>
<i> will be executed.</i>

01:04.790 --> 01:06.760
<i> We're going to try</i>
<i> and get a comment</i>

01:06.760 --> 01:08.730
<i> from the woman</i>
<i> who prosecuted Wilton:</i>

01:08.730 --> 01:11.060
<i> Assistant District Attorney</i>
<i> Alex Cahill.</i>

01:11.070 --> 01:12.630
Turn it off, Trivette.

01:12.630 --> 01:14.800
<i> She's expected to arrive here</i>
<i> at Texas state prison</i>

01:14.800 --> 01:16.040
<i> within the hour.</i>
All right.

01:16.040 --> 01:18.110
What are you so uptight about?
( clicks )

01:18.110 --> 01:19.640
Nothing.

01:22.550 --> 01:24.180
Stakeout doesn't
make any sense, anyway.

01:24.180 --> 01:25.910
I mean, Critter jumped bail.

01:25.920 --> 01:28.080
He's not gonna come waltzing
out here in broad daylight.

01:28.080 --> 01:29.520
His uncle owns
this nursery,

01:29.520 --> 01:31.120
and it closes
in a few minutes.

01:31.120 --> 01:33.950
Critter has no money,
and he has no place else to go.

01:33.960 --> 01:34.960
He'll be here.

01:34.960 --> 01:36.520
No, he won't.

01:36.530 --> 01:38.160
Yes, he will.

01:38.160 --> 01:39.260
No, he won't.

01:46.100 --> 01:48.470
Well, speak of the devil.

01:48.470 --> 01:50.470
I hate it when you gloat.

01:52.170 --> 01:53.740
Critter.

Texas Rangers.

02:44.530 --> 02:45.990
Whoa, whoa.
Slow down, Trivette.

02:47.800 --> 02:50.500
You wanna read him
his rights?

02:50.500 --> 02:53.070
Do I look like I want
to read him his rights?

02:53.070 --> 02:55.900
I just ran my legs off,
so you could catch him--

02:57.740 --> 02:58.740
Ah, Critter.

02:58.740 --> 03:01.340
Attempted murder of a Ranger.

03:01.340 --> 03:05.010
TRIVETTE:
That will put you away
for a long time, pal.

03:05.010 --> 03:07.010
CRITTER:
Wait, wait.
Let's negotiate.

03:07.020 --> 03:09.050
You got nothing to negotiate.

03:09.050 --> 03:10.750
I got something.

03:10.750 --> 03:13.290
Woodrow Wilton
ain't Night Shift.

03:13.290 --> 03:15.520
Killer's still out there.

03:15.520 --> 03:17.890
You're fixin' to kill
an innocent man.

04:02.000 --> 04:03.970
Can I have a smoke?

04:03.970 --> 04:04.970
No.

04:05.970 --> 04:08.910
Now, I'm trying to be friendly.

04:08.910 --> 04:12.510
Y'all could...meet me halfway.

04:13.950 --> 04:17.579
You lyin', thievin',
drug-dealing piece of trash.

04:17.589 --> 04:22.420
You're already halfway
to the deepest, darkest hole

04:22.420 --> 04:23.660
in the state of Texas.

04:23.660 --> 04:26.290
For life.

04:26.300 --> 04:27.760
ALEX:
Trivette!

04:31.270 --> 04:32.500
He's getting to be
as bad as you.

04:39.210 --> 04:40.870
Hell, this is a waste of time.

04:43.010 --> 04:45.250
Woodrow Wilton's
the night shift killer,

04:45.250 --> 04:47.580
how come you never found
all the stuff?

04:47.580 --> 04:50.850
Fifteen murders,
only one bag of clothes.

04:50.850 --> 04:51.850
He admitted he did it.

04:51.850 --> 04:55.390
Why not tell you
where the stuff is?

04:55.390 --> 04:57.490
Why would he wanna
do that, Critter?

04:57.490 --> 05:00.490
He knows he's getting
the death penalty anyway.

05:00.500 --> 05:03.430
It's a form of psychological
retribution.

05:03.430 --> 05:05.200
Now, there's a mouthful.

05:05.200 --> 05:07.300
Almost wrap your arms
around words like that.

05:07.300 --> 05:08.970
Make you sleep better at night.

05:10.140 --> 05:11.910
You want a matching
pair of eyes?
Ugh.

05:11.910 --> 05:13.370
Walker.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.080
I take it back.

05:18.080 --> 05:19.810
Nobody's as bad as you.

05:19.820 --> 05:22.220
No deal.

05:22.220 --> 05:24.750
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

05:26.520 --> 05:28.860
There's a dried-up creek bed
in Hamilton's gulch.

05:28.860 --> 05:30.890
You go look there.

05:30.890 --> 05:33.130
Just to the right
of Simmons Bridge.

05:33.130 --> 05:34.160
Buried by the creek.

JUDGE:
The closing arguments
will begin with the prosecution.

06:16.510 --> 06:18.400
Your Honor.

06:23.880 --> 06:27.310
For the past four months,

06:27.320 --> 06:29.850
you've heard things
that no human being

06:29.850 --> 06:32.320
should have ever
been forced to hear.

06:33.990 --> 06:35.620
You have listened to evidence

06:35.620 --> 06:38.660
of the most grizzly nature

06:38.660 --> 06:40.530
and seen pictures more horrible

06:40.530 --> 06:42.930
than any of us
could have ever imagined.

06:44.930 --> 06:47.100
Ladies and gentlemen,

06:47.100 --> 06:48.300
the evidence has shown

06:48.300 --> 06:51.870
that Woodrow Jonathan Wilton

06:51.870 --> 06:54.610
stalked our neighborhoods.

06:54.610 --> 06:59.550
Fifteen women were tortured
and brutally electrocuted,

06:59.550 --> 07:01.310
and any one of them
could've been...

07:02.420 --> 07:03.880
your sister...

07:05.650 --> 07:06.950
or your daughter.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.990
Or yours.

07:10.990 --> 07:13.260
And then he'd leave them

07:13.260 --> 07:16.130
brazenly out in the open
for us to find,

07:16.130 --> 07:17.700
daring us to stop him.

07:20.000 --> 07:21.000
After every killing,

07:21.000 --> 07:23.870
he sent letters
to the newspapers

07:23.870 --> 07:27.370
mocking us,
daring us to stop him.

07:31.010 --> 07:33.780
You have heard
how we found the clothing

07:33.780 --> 07:38.050
of one of the victims
buried in Wilton's backyard.

07:38.050 --> 07:40.350
You have heard

07:40.360 --> 07:42.820
how we matched the typewriter
found in his home

07:42.820 --> 07:45.790
to the letters that were sent
to the newspaper.

07:45.790 --> 07:47.560
And you have heard

07:47.560 --> 07:50.660
the defendant's
own confession.

07:50.670 --> 07:51.930
Ladies and gentlemen,

07:51.930 --> 07:56.200
Woodrow Wilton is still
daring us to stop him.

07:56.210 --> 07:58.540
You can stop him

07:58.540 --> 08:01.410
with a guilty verdict
of capital murder.

08:18.890 --> 08:20.890
TRIVETTE:
And then you know
what I'm gonna do?

08:20.900 --> 08:22.600
I'm gonna take the shovel
back to the jail.

08:22.600 --> 08:24.360
I'm gonna beat Critter
over the head with it.

08:25.430 --> 08:26.770
Of course,
this is good exercise.

08:26.770 --> 08:28.740
Maybe I ought to work this
into my cross-training.

08:28.740 --> 08:30.170
Maybe you should work
some silence

08:30.170 --> 08:31.340
into your cross-training.

08:31.340 --> 08:33.309
It's good to talk, Walker.

08:33.309 --> 08:35.580
Especially when you're doing
something like this.

08:35.580 --> 08:37.210
Helps relieve the tension.

08:37.210 --> 08:39.080
That way the stress
won't build up inside of you.

08:39.080 --> 08:42.780
You feel good,
if you learn to open up

08:42.780 --> 08:44.980
and express your feelings, huh?

08:47.390 --> 08:49.120
Hey, I got something here.

08:53.330 --> 08:54.460
It's a damn beer can.

08:54.460 --> 08:56.200
See? People don't know
what they do.

08:56.200 --> 08:57.630
They're ruining the outdoors.

08:57.630 --> 08:58.670
We got nice, clean country.

08:58.670 --> 09:00.200
Fresh air.

09:00.200 --> 09:01.900
Walker,
Critter's yanking our chain.

09:01.900 --> 09:03.200
There's nothing here, all right?

09:03.210 --> 09:04.440
Keep digging.

09:04.440 --> 09:05.840
There's nothing here.

09:05.840 --> 09:07.410
Dig another one.

09:07.410 --> 09:10.340
Right. A job worth starting
is a job worth finishing.

09:10.350 --> 09:11.510
That's what I always say.

09:11.510 --> 09:12.980
That's why, when
I played football,

09:12.980 --> 09:14.510
I ran out every play.

09:14.520 --> 09:16.320
'Cause you never know
when a little hustle

09:16.320 --> 09:17.880
could make a difference.

09:17.890 --> 09:20.490
Like a downfield block
on a broken play

09:20.490 --> 09:21.490
springs the back...

09:23.430 --> 09:25.090
What do you got?

09:36.800 --> 09:38.370
"Loretta Coleman."

09:38.370 --> 09:39.370
It's one of the victims?

09:39.370 --> 09:40.840
Yeah.

09:40.840 --> 09:42.610
Let's keep digging.

09:50.790 --> 09:53.050
Looks like we got 'em all now.

09:53.050 --> 09:54.150
All 14 of 'em.

10:00.300 --> 10:02.730
I guess Critter wasn't yanking
our chain after all, huh?

10:06.570 --> 10:09.640
Why didn't Wilton tell us
about this after he confessed?

10:09.640 --> 10:12.340
I got to admit,
it's getting awful crazy.

10:14.010 --> 10:15.010
Let's go.

10:15.010 --> 10:16.140
Where to?

10:16.140 --> 10:17.810
State prison.

10:18.810 --> 10:20.350
( crowd shouting angrily )

10:25.250 --> 10:26.420
Hey, there's Cordell Walker,

10:26.420 --> 10:27.950
one of the Rangers
who arrested Wilton.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.190
Testified against him in court.

10:29.190 --> 10:30.290
Hey, hey!

10:33.100 --> 10:35.930
These people are nuts.

10:35.930 --> 10:38.670
Like you said, Trivette,
makes 'em feel good.

10:38.670 --> 10:41.530
They're just opening up
and expressing themselves.

10:41.540 --> 10:44.940
Anybody ever tell you
you got a mean sense of humor?

10:44.940 --> 10:46.570
Mm-hm.

10:59.650 --> 11:00.920
You got visitors.

11:03.960 --> 11:05.990
Why are you here?

11:05.990 --> 11:07.460
Come to see me sweat, Ranger?

11:09.300 --> 11:10.300
Oh, where's the other guy?

11:12.270 --> 11:14.270
Oh, that's right.
He had some bad luck.

11:14.270 --> 11:16.770
He got shot,
and he had to retire.

11:16.770 --> 11:19.440
Why are you so eager to die,
Woodrow?

11:19.440 --> 11:21.540
Because I did it.

11:21.540 --> 11:23.880
I got caught, I die.
That's it.

11:23.880 --> 11:27.180
No use stretching it out
with appeals.

11:27.180 --> 11:28.610
Let's get it over with.

11:28.620 --> 11:31.480
But I would think you at least
would want to brag about it.

11:31.490 --> 11:33.150
Tell your whole story.

11:34.620 --> 11:36.720
I mean, there's people
pay big bucks for that.

11:36.730 --> 11:38.120
Couldn't your family
use the money?

11:38.130 --> 11:39.890
You leave my family out of this.

11:39.900 --> 11:41.130
Got nothing
to do with them.

11:41.130 --> 11:42.130
I done what I done.

11:44.130 --> 11:45.900
And you can just quit
with all your questions,

11:45.900 --> 11:47.630
'cause I'm taking
my answers to the grave.

11:51.140 --> 11:53.340
Well, give me one answer.

11:53.340 --> 11:55.380
What did you do with
those women's clothes?

11:55.380 --> 11:57.940
I don't have to answer that,
now do I?

11:57.950 --> 12:01.450
No, you don't.
Because we already know.

12:01.450 --> 12:03.050
We found them
out at Cedar Creek.

12:06.590 --> 12:08.790
Oh.

12:08.790 --> 12:10.560
Good for you.

12:12.090 --> 12:13.360
Now you know.

12:13.360 --> 12:16.500
(<i> mysterious theme playing</i> )

12:19.500 --> 12:20.630
Guard.

12:29.980 --> 12:32.410
He didn't know
about the clothes, Walker.

12:32.410 --> 12:34.210
I know.

12:41.860 --> 12:43.720
It doesn't make sense

12:43.730 --> 12:45.490
for Woodrow to want
to be executed

12:45.490 --> 12:47.690
for something that
he didn't do, Walker.

12:47.700 --> 12:49.000
Maybe not, Alex.

12:49.000 --> 12:50.130
But he didn't know

12:50.130 --> 12:51.770
where those women's clothes
were buried.

12:51.770 --> 12:54.500
His bust never did set right
with you, did it?

12:54.500 --> 12:55.840
No.

12:55.840 --> 12:58.670
RAY:
I remember when
he was arrested, Washoe.

12:58.670 --> 13:00.170
You couldn't sleep
for a month,

13:00.180 --> 13:02.340
and the spirits cried
out your window every night.

13:02.340 --> 13:03.940
Spirits?

13:03.950 --> 13:05.880
Well, there's a storm
out at the ranch,

13:05.880 --> 13:07.880
and the wind was howling
all night.

13:07.880 --> 13:10.320
The wind carries
the voice of the spirits.

13:10.320 --> 13:12.390
Your head might
tell you otherwise,

13:12.390 --> 13:15.590
but if your heart
is Cherokee, it knows.

13:15.590 --> 13:17.860
Good night.
I'll be at the ranch.

13:17.860 --> 13:18.930
Good night, Uncle Ray.

13:18.930 --> 13:20.490
Night, Ray.

13:23.460 --> 13:25.530
Woodrow has to be
protecting someone.

13:25.530 --> 13:27.870
He got awful protective
when I mentioned his family.

13:27.870 --> 13:29.740
He has a wife
and 9-year-old daughter.

13:29.740 --> 13:31.270
Alex, contact the judge

13:31.270 --> 13:32.870
and see if you can get
a stay of execution.

13:32.870 --> 13:35.070
( sighing ):
I'll speak to him,

13:35.080 --> 13:36.340
but I'm sure
that we don't have

13:36.340 --> 13:38.780
enough new evidence
to convince him.

13:38.780 --> 13:39.880
C.D.:
Cordell,

13:39.880 --> 13:41.750
we didn't make
a mistake here, did we?

13:41.750 --> 13:43.050
I mean, we had the evidence.

13:43.050 --> 13:45.180
I don't know, C.D.

13:45.190 --> 13:46.790
Let's go.

13:48.690 --> 13:49.890
Yeah, good night.

13:52.060 --> 13:54.990
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

14:10.210 --> 14:11.480
Walker. Walker, come back.

14:11.480 --> 14:12.810
This is C.D.

14:12.810 --> 14:13.880
( buzzing )

14:16.220 --> 14:17.550
What's up, C.D.?

14:17.550 --> 14:20.290
Yeah, I just got a hot tip
on this night shift thing.

14:20.290 --> 14:21.990
I think it's worth
looking into.

14:21.990 --> 14:25.060
Well, don't get too excited.
Could be another crank.

14:25.060 --> 14:27.690
You're just jealous
'cause you never get any tips.

14:27.700 --> 14:28.760
You know why?

14:28.760 --> 14:30.660
Why?

14:30.670 --> 14:32.370
'Cause you been
knocking people out

14:32.370 --> 14:34.300
and expecting them
to talk in their sleep.

14:34.300 --> 14:35.740
That's why.

14:35.740 --> 14:38.610
What's the address?

14:38.610 --> 14:41.140
355 Wilmont.

14:41.140 --> 14:42.780
( pencil scratching )

14:42.780 --> 14:43.810
Yeah, meet you there.

14:45.550 --> 14:46.750
Ten-four.

15:04.430 --> 15:06.000
What you got, Jim?
Hey, C.D.

15:06.000 --> 15:07.670
This guy's not here.
We're out back.

15:07.670 --> 15:08.740
All right.

15:12.640 --> 15:14.670
( digging and grunting )

15:16.240 --> 15:17.740
How's the family doing, Jim?

15:17.750 --> 15:19.310
Doing fine, C.D.
How 'bout yourself?

15:19.310 --> 15:21.250
C.D.:
Good. No complaints.

15:21.250 --> 15:23.320
Robert,
let me have that shovel.

15:23.320 --> 15:25.850
You city boys
couldn't even dig worms.

15:25.850 --> 15:27.820
( chuckles )

15:27.820 --> 15:30.420
Hey, C.D.,
I got something here.
Yeah?

15:41.070 --> 15:43.370
You sure as hell do.

15:43.370 --> 15:44.670
Now, C.D., hold on a minute.

15:44.670 --> 15:46.470
Nah. We got probable cause.

15:52.710 --> 15:55.510
<i> "Dallas Evening Chronicle,</i>
I've done it again.

I've fried,

It's him.
He just drove up.

16:03.160 --> 16:04.590
C.D.:
Texas Ranger.
Freeze, boy.

16:04.590 --> 16:05.730
Get your butt
up on that hood.

16:05.730 --> 16:06.760
What's this about?

16:06.760 --> 16:08.690
Put your butt up
on that hood, I said.

16:08.700 --> 16:10.360
It's about murder.
That's what it's about.

16:10.360 --> 16:11.560
You can remain silent.

16:11.570 --> 16:13.200
If you give up your right
to remain silent,

16:13.200 --> 16:15.840
anything you say can be used
against you in a court of law.

16:15.840 --> 16:17.170
I didn't do anything.

16:17.170 --> 16:19.140
If you can't afford
an attorney, we'll provide--

16:19.140 --> 16:20.310
C.D., ease up.
Ease up, C.D.

16:20.310 --> 16:21.670
No. No!

16:22.880 --> 16:24.880
Please, help me.

16:24.880 --> 16:26.880
I'm innocent.

I'm innocent!

16:31.090 --> 16:33.020
I'm innocent!

16:33.020 --> 16:34.220
Read him his rights.

16:34.220 --> 16:35.620
You have the right
to remain silent.

16:35.620 --> 16:37.090
I'm innocent!

16:51.770 --> 16:55.010

17:22.099 --> 17:23.270
So I guess, uh...

17:23.270 --> 17:24.540
Well, you don't think

17:24.540 --> 17:26.010
this is a waste of time
after all.

17:26.010 --> 17:27.470
Ten to 15.

17:27.480 --> 17:29.980
What? Uh, no way.

17:29.980 --> 17:31.480
This is too good.
One to five.

17:31.480 --> 17:33.650
You're looking at life.

17:33.650 --> 17:35.550
So are you.

17:35.550 --> 17:37.680
Woodrow Wilton's.

17:37.690 --> 17:39.750
And it's all your fault.

17:41.590 --> 17:42.990
You know, Critter,

17:42.990 --> 17:44.860
I wouldn't be surprised
if you weren't mixed up

17:44.860 --> 17:45.920
in these murders.

17:45.930 --> 17:47.030
What do you think, Trivette?

17:47.030 --> 17:48.760
He knew about the clothes.

17:48.760 --> 17:49.930
Works for me.

17:49.930 --> 17:51.460
That's right.

17:51.470 --> 17:53.570
You can't do this.
You can't use that against me.

17:53.570 --> 17:56.000
You were read your rights.
You waived them.

17:58.910 --> 17:59.940
Okay, ten to 15.

18:01.310 --> 18:02.840
Now that we're all friends,

18:02.840 --> 18:04.810
how 'bout a smoke?

18:04.810 --> 18:06.480
Who did it?

18:06.480 --> 18:10.850
Okay, I used to live
in this little town

18:10.850 --> 18:12.590
near Hamilton's gulch
about five years ago.

18:13.490 --> 18:14.850
Part of a club.

18:14.860 --> 18:19.230
Well, some of my associates
used to be pretty severe.

18:19.230 --> 18:20.630
But there was this one guy.

18:20.630 --> 18:22.900
He'd scare the devil.

18:22.900 --> 18:24.860
Spooky.
He had these eyes like...

18:26.600 --> 18:27.700
Like, I don't know.

18:29.070 --> 18:30.270
Manson or something.

18:32.370 --> 18:35.910
Anyway, one day I was out
partying by the creek,

18:35.910 --> 18:38.080
and I saw him burying the stuff

18:38.080 --> 18:40.650
day after one of them women
disappeared.

18:40.650 --> 18:41.780
What stuff?

18:41.780 --> 18:43.650
Clothes.

18:43.650 --> 18:46.050
I hightailed it out of there,
so he couldn't see me.

18:46.050 --> 18:47.620
Give me a name.

18:47.620 --> 18:49.320
Leon.

18:49.320 --> 18:50.860
Leon who?

18:53.460 --> 18:54.460
That's all I know.

18:54.460 --> 18:55.600
WALKER:
That's all you know.

18:55.600 --> 18:57.060
Guard, get him out of here!

18:57.070 --> 18:59.170
Forget it.
You get life.

18:59.170 --> 19:00.470
Ah, well, um...

19:01.700 --> 19:04.440
He had a tattoo on his forearm.

19:04.440 --> 19:06.440
A scorpion?
That's right.

19:07.380 --> 19:08.640
CRITTER:
A scorpion.

19:08.640 --> 19:12.540
Uh, he used to hang out
at Mac's Pool Hall on Main.

19:24.020 --> 19:26.460
Ugh! You broke my damn wrist.

19:26.460 --> 19:27.760
You know what they say.

19:27.760 --> 19:29.560
Them's the breaks.

19:29.560 --> 19:31.460
My money.

19:35.800 --> 19:37.240
Your name Leon?

19:38.640 --> 19:41.010
That's what my mama said.

19:41.010 --> 19:43.180
Texas Rangers, Leon.

19:43.180 --> 19:45.240
We want a word with ya.
Come here.

19:50.250 --> 19:52.320
Do you know a guy
by the name of Woodrow Wilton?

19:53.490 --> 19:55.850
I reckon anybody with a TV
knows who he is.

19:55.860 --> 19:57.220
He's the night shift killer.

19:57.230 --> 19:59.190
That's it? You've just
seen him on television?

19:59.190 --> 20:01.890
Matter of fact, that damn wacko

20:01.900 --> 20:03.960
used to be my electric man.

20:03.960 --> 20:05.670
Sick puppy.

20:05.670 --> 20:06.870
Good riddance.

20:06.870 --> 20:08.500
Is that it?

20:08.500 --> 20:10.200
Yeah.

20:10.200 --> 20:12.840
Say, have you been
to Hamilton's gulch lately?

20:14.280 --> 20:16.140
Mister, I don't know
what you're talking about.

20:16.140 --> 20:17.610
I never heard of no
Hamilton's gulch.

20:17.610 --> 20:19.280
That's funny,
'cause a friend of yours

20:19.280 --> 20:20.950
said he rode
with you down there.

20:20.950 --> 20:22.210
Well, I didn't.

20:22.220 --> 20:23.250
TRIVETTE:
You sure?

20:24.820 --> 20:25.990
He described you pretty well.

20:25.990 --> 20:27.820
Even your tattoo.

20:27.820 --> 20:29.560
Fella goes by the name
of Critter.

20:29.560 --> 20:30.560
Critter?

20:30.560 --> 20:31.560
( scoffs )

20:31.560 --> 20:33.890
I rode with him in Fort Worth.

20:33.900 --> 20:36.030
Ah, he's totally gone.

20:36.030 --> 20:37.760
You know, drugs and such.

20:37.770 --> 20:40.300
Lights are on.
Nobody's home.

20:40.300 --> 20:41.630
That's funny.

20:41.640 --> 20:43.070
He said the same thing
about you.

20:43.070 --> 20:46.840
Mister, look.
I'm a law-abiding citizen.

20:46.840 --> 20:49.680
Ain't done nothing
to be ashamed of.

20:49.680 --> 20:51.040
So you leave me be.

20:51.050 --> 20:53.710
We will...for now.

20:55.950 --> 20:59.350
MAN: You ain't goin'?
MAN 2: No way, man, I'm in.

20:59.350 --> 21:00.420
MAN 2:
I'm here to play.

21:04.290 --> 21:06.990
MAN: Oh, that's good.
MAN 2: Here comes five in a--

21:09.660 --> 21:11.830
<i> And</i> Critter was right
on the money

21:11.830 --> 21:14.630
about Muncie's eyes.
That is one bad hombre.

21:14.640 --> 21:16.370
I guarantee you guys
he's bent the law

21:16.370 --> 21:17.500
more than a couple of times.

21:17.510 --> 21:19.510
You told me it was too neat.

21:19.510 --> 21:22.540
Good Lord, what have I done?

21:22.540 --> 21:24.440
Come on, C.D.

21:24.450 --> 21:25.880
Aren't you the one that said

21:25.880 --> 21:27.780
never to worry about
what's been done?

21:27.780 --> 21:29.450
But to concentrate
on what needs to be done.

21:29.450 --> 21:31.580
TRIVETTE:
Yeah, you saved my life
with that advice.

21:31.590 --> 21:34.920
Maybe it's time for you
to take some of it, huh?

21:34.920 --> 21:36.560
Yeah.

21:37.590 --> 21:38.620
Thanks.

21:39.360 --> 21:40.760
Hey, wait a minute.

21:40.760 --> 21:44.230
There was always something
that we left out of the papers

21:44.230 --> 21:45.430
to keep the kooks away.

21:45.430 --> 21:46.500
On all the bodies,

21:46.500 --> 21:48.930
we found melted wax
on the right foot.

21:48.940 --> 21:50.740
That's right.
I remember that.

21:50.740 --> 21:53.010
Sort of a signature.

21:53.010 --> 21:55.010
Hell, I don't have
any idea what it meant.

21:55.010 --> 21:57.510
Washoe,
you gotta take time

21:57.510 --> 21:58.910
to listen to the spirits.

21:58.910 --> 22:00.450
If you listen to the wind,
it will tell ya

22:00.450 --> 22:01.950
if there's danger near.

22:01.950 --> 22:03.150
It could save you.

22:03.150 --> 22:04.520
I will, Uncle Ray.

22:04.520 --> 22:06.320
The judge denied the stay.

22:06.320 --> 22:08.350
The execution will
proceed as scheduled.

22:12.930 --> 22:14.830
GUARD:
Lockdown.

22:22.140 --> 22:25.700
(<i> ominous theme playing</i> )

23:06.380 --> 23:07.380
Mrs. Wilton?

23:07.380 --> 23:08.380
Yes.

23:08.380 --> 23:10.780
I'm Ranger Walker.

23:10.790 --> 23:13.020
Hi. I remember you
from Woodrow's trial.

23:13.020 --> 23:14.420
Yes, ma'am.

23:14.420 --> 23:16.290
Could I talk to you
for a few minutes?

23:16.290 --> 23:18.690
Why? What's there
to talk about?

23:18.690 --> 23:20.490
I mean, it'll all be
over soon anyway.

23:20.500 --> 23:23.160
I'm trying to reopen
your husband's case.

23:23.160 --> 23:25.000
I have reason to believe
he's innocent.

23:36.610 --> 23:37.740
I never thought he was guilty,

23:37.750 --> 23:39.610
even when he confessed.

23:39.610 --> 23:42.010
Can you remember anything that
your husband may have told you

23:42.020 --> 23:43.650
that would help me
with his case?

23:44.620 --> 23:48.190
I mean, when they arrested him,

23:48.190 --> 23:49.390
he swore he was innocent.

23:51.360 --> 23:53.430
Held him in my arms. He cried.

23:55.830 --> 23:58.230
I couldn't understand
how anyone could believe

23:58.230 --> 23:59.630
he would do something
like that.

24:01.840 --> 24:03.300
He hated being away
from Chrissie.

24:05.110 --> 24:06.440
Wanted to make sure
that I told her

24:06.440 --> 24:09.480
how much he loved her
every night.

24:09.480 --> 24:11.580
Then, a week later,
he confessed.

24:13.580 --> 24:15.550
Told me to stay away,
that he never wanted

24:15.550 --> 24:16.750
to see either one of us again.

24:19.020 --> 24:20.890
He never answered
any of my letters.

24:22.920 --> 24:25.390
So finally I-- I gave up.

24:28.660 --> 24:30.230
But I still love him.

24:35.240 --> 24:38.940
'Cause I know he could never
do anything like that.

24:41.240 --> 24:43.380
I just know it.

24:48.180 --> 24:50.980
Okay, something must have
happened after he was arrested

24:50.990 --> 24:53.090
for him to change his plea.

24:53.090 --> 24:54.650
He was in jail.

24:56.690 --> 24:59.320
Let's find out who
his visitors were that week.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.500
( keyboard clicking )

25:08.300 --> 25:09.300
Here it comes.

25:09.300 --> 25:12.500
Let me guess.

25:12.510 --> 25:13.910
His wife.

25:13.910 --> 25:15.270
His lawyer.

25:15.280 --> 25:16.840
And Leon Muncie.

25:17.510 --> 25:18.840
I'll be damned.

25:20.450 --> 25:21.850
See if he has a record.

25:21.850 --> 25:24.380
( keyboard clicking )

25:27.920 --> 25:29.690
One conviction for assault.

25:29.690 --> 25:32.730
Six other arrests.
No convictions.

25:32.730 --> 25:34.460
Burglary.

He was in the Navy.

An electrician.

25:46.810 --> 25:49.210
You got visitors again.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.150
Hello, Woodrow.

25:53.150 --> 25:54.550
Ranger.

25:59.450 --> 26:03.320
Woodrow, why'd you
burn their hands with wax

26:03.320 --> 26:04.990
before you fried them?

26:06.330 --> 26:09.290
That's my business,
isn't it?

26:09.300 --> 26:10.600
I did what I did.

26:10.600 --> 26:12.060
Now I'm paying the price.

26:12.070 --> 26:13.930
Ain't that enough for you?

26:13.930 --> 26:15.800
Might be,
except it wasn't their hands

26:15.800 --> 26:16.900
that were burned with wax,

26:16.900 --> 26:17.940
it was their feet.

26:18.740 --> 26:19.740
Well.

26:19.740 --> 26:21.710
Who's Leon Muncie?

26:21.710 --> 26:23.470
Why don't you two leave me be.

26:23.480 --> 26:25.340
Let me die in peace.

out of here!

26:30.050 --> 26:31.550
What's the problem,
Woodrow?

26:31.550 --> 26:33.990
You are!

26:35.860 --> 26:38.660
I have to die.

26:38.660 --> 26:41.960
But I don't have to
talk to you anymore.

26:41.960 --> 26:45.730
You're dying for something
you didn't do, Woodrow.

26:45.730 --> 26:48.300
And we don't know why.

27:16.830 --> 27:18.600
Stay away from me.

27:18.600 --> 27:20.200
You ain't got
many friends

27:20.200 --> 27:22.100

27:22.100 --> 27:25.070
You ought to be
nice to me.

27:25.070 --> 27:26.340
You'll never
get away with this.

27:27.140 --> 27:29.640
Of course, I will.

You're lying.

27:42.790 --> 27:44.490
I would never
lie to you.

27:45.290 --> 27:47.890
They'll arrest you.

You'll never get near
my family.

27:50.400 --> 27:51.900
Tsk, tsk, tsk.

27:51.900 --> 27:53.400
You gonna bet
your family's life

27:53.400 --> 27:54.930
on the cops?

27:54.940 --> 27:57.300
Come on, Woodrow.

27:57.300 --> 27:58.970
You already called them
once anonymously,

27:58.970 --> 27:59.970
didn't you?

28:01.780 --> 28:02.780
Sure, you did.

28:03.640 --> 28:07.750
I told you I would know.

28:07.750 --> 28:09.750
You called and you said

28:09.750 --> 28:11.120
you found the power box

28:11.120 --> 28:14.020
diverting extra electricity
into a house,

28:14.020 --> 28:17.860
and there was a woman
frying inside.

28:19.990 --> 28:23.900
I tapped your phone, sport.

28:23.900 --> 28:27.670
And they didn't find
any power box

28:27.670 --> 28:30.640
diverting electricity,
did they?

28:30.640 --> 28:33.510
All they found
were her clothes

28:33.510 --> 28:35.810
in your backyard.

28:36.610 --> 28:38.110
Hey, I'll tell you what.

28:38.110 --> 28:39.540
The name is Leon.

28:39.550 --> 28:41.780
Leon Muncie.

28:41.780 --> 28:46.150
Tell the cops, okay?

28:46.150 --> 28:48.750
I bet I get your family,

28:48.760 --> 28:52.990
and I fry them up real good.

28:52.990 --> 28:55.260
You bet on the cops.

You're crazy.

You're out of your mind.

You say that

some buffalo wings?

30:40.900 --> 30:42.530
They're hot off
the roach coach.

30:42.540 --> 30:44.540
You lied to us, Leon.

30:44.540 --> 30:47.510
You told us Woodrow Wilton
was just your electrician,

30:47.510 --> 30:49.770
but we found out you went
to visit him in jail.

30:49.780 --> 30:51.780
Ah, he's a nice guy.

30:51.780 --> 30:53.480
Look, I know how
the law can be.

30:53.480 --> 30:55.280
I did a little time myself
for a fistfight.

30:55.280 --> 30:57.080
Yeah, a year in county jail.

30:57.080 --> 30:59.590
That's right.
A whole year in stir

30:59.590 --> 31:01.820
just for defending myself
in a bar fight.

31:01.820 --> 31:03.490
It's interesting,
in defending yourself,

31:03.490 --> 31:04.560
you broke a man's jaw,

31:04.560 --> 31:06.390
tore his arm
clear out of the socket,

31:06.390 --> 31:08.530
and then you caved in
his rib cage.

31:08.530 --> 31:09.590
You're right.

31:09.600 --> 31:12.660
That's mighty interesting,
Ranger.

31:12.670 --> 31:14.670
Anyhow, I know how it is

31:14.670 --> 31:16.670
to get railroaded by the law,

31:16.670 --> 31:19.810
so I figure I'll give old
Woodrow a little moral support.

Woo-hoo.

to him once alone,

31:26.210 --> 31:27.480
I never went back again.

You're not as smart
as you think are, Leon.

31:30.380 --> 31:32.050
No?

31:32.050 --> 31:34.350
No, you're not, Leon.

31:34.350 --> 31:36.320
You tell a good story.

Where you at?

43:50.490 --> 43:54.930
Don't you just love this
fine justice system of ours?

43:54.930 --> 43:56.230
Wilton's gonna burn today,

43:56.230 --> 43:58.060
and then I can do my thing

43:58.060 --> 44:01.200
and find some other sucker
for you guys to fry.

44:01.200 --> 44:02.930
"He leadeth me
in the paths of righteousness

44:02.940 --> 44:04.470
"for his name's sake.

44:04.470 --> 44:06.100
"Yea, though I walk

44:06.110 --> 44:07.770
"through the valley
of the shadow of death,

44:07.770 --> 44:09.640
"I will fear no evil.

44:09.640 --> 44:11.910
"For thou art with me.

44:11.910 --> 44:13.750
Thy rod and thy staff..."

44:13.750 --> 44:16.710
Where you at, Ranger?
You dead already?

44:16.720 --> 44:17.850
( laughs )

44:20.390 --> 44:24.360
Come out, come out
wherever you are.

44:27.490 --> 44:29.860
Ask and you shall
receive, Leon.

44:29.860 --> 44:31.360
You're under arrest.

44:31.360 --> 44:34.400
No way. You ain't
taking me back alive.

44:34.400 --> 44:37.470
( grunting )

44:42.610 --> 44:43.710
( groans )

44:45.250 --> 44:46.910
Killing's too good for you,
Leon.

44:54.420 --> 44:57.150
PRIEST:
"Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me

44:57.160 --> 44:58.490
"all the days of my life.

44:58.490 --> 45:01.830
And I will dwell in the house
of the Lord forever."

45:03.330 --> 45:05.460
Hold it!
Hold everything.

45:05.460 --> 45:07.600
ALEX:
I've got an order from
the governor that states,

45:07.600 --> 45:08.930
"Due to new evidence uncovered

45:08.940 --> 45:10.570
"by Cordell Walker
of the Texas Rangers,

45:10.570 --> 45:14.270
I hereby order a stay
of execution of Woodrow Wilton."

45:14.270 --> 45:15.440
But-- But I--

45:15.440 --> 45:16.570
We arrested Leon Muncie,

45:16.580 --> 45:19.240
and we'll make it stick.

45:19.250 --> 45:20.550
Your family's safe.

45:20.550 --> 45:21.880
(<i> joyous theme playing</i> )

45:21.880 --> 45:23.110
( crying happily )

45:26.090 --> 45:27.590
( muffled ):
Thank you.

45:27.590 --> 45:29.490
Thank you.

45:29.490 --> 45:31.160
Thank you.

45:32.090 --> 45:33.260
Thank you.

45:46.470 --> 45:49.070
C.D.:
Isn't that just about
the prettiest little girl

45:49.080 --> 45:51.410
you ever seen in your life?

45:51.410 --> 45:53.950
To think she almost
lost her father forever

45:53.950 --> 45:55.610
because of
something I did.

45:55.610 --> 45:57.280
I'll tell you one thing, Alex.

45:57.280 --> 46:00.020
I'm not gonna be near
so quick to judge anymore.

46:00.020 --> 46:01.320
Uh-uh.

46:01.320 --> 46:03.120
I'm gonna make sure
I always look

46:03.120 --> 46:06.320
for the signs of innocence
as well as the guilt.

46:06.330 --> 46:07.830
Come here, Cordell.

46:07.830 --> 46:11.030
We done a real good thing
here today.

46:11.030 --> 46:13.200
Yeah, we sure did.

46:13.200 --> 46:15.170
I'll tell you one thing,
C.D.,

46:15.170 --> 46:17.570
I'm gonna listen
to my instincts from now on.

46:17.570 --> 46:20.270
Well, we all learned
a good lesson.

46:20.270 --> 46:23.240
Yeah, like not to hide
behind a propane tank

46:23.240 --> 46:24.640
in the middle
of a dang gunfight.

46:24.640 --> 46:25.740
Or run like hell.
Ow!

46:25.740 --> 46:27.110
Oh, I'm sorry.
