WEBVTT

01:10.809 --> 01:12.898
[narrator] From the bowels
of the earth

01:12.942 --> 01:15.336
and the depths
of the oceans,
they came.

01:15.379 --> 01:19.166
Titans. Kraken. Kaiju.

01:19.209 --> 01:22.299
Their earth-shattering battles
thrilled mankind.

01:22.343 --> 01:26.999
Human and creature teamed up
to create the greatest sport
of all time:

01:27.043 --> 01:29.915
Monster Wrestling!

01:29.959 --> 01:32.135
From the ancient arenas
of yesteryear

01:32.179 --> 01:34.572
to the cutting-edge stadiums
of today,

01:34.616 --> 01:36.574
these rare beasts wrestle

01:36.618 --> 01:39.534
for the glory
of their hometowns and cities,

01:39.577 --> 01:43.712
fighting for the World
Monster Wrestling championship.

01:43.755 --> 01:46.323
And it was the town
of Stoker-on-Avon

01:46.367 --> 01:50.153
that gave us the greatest
wrestling team of all time--

01:50.197 --> 01:52.764
Rayburn
and Coach Jimbo Coyle.

01:52.808 --> 01:54.853
Yeah! That'’s how
you do it, champ.

01:54.897 --> 01:58.770
Nine-time winners
of the Big Belt,
they dominated the sport...

02:00.468 --> 02:02.557
until tragedy stuck.

02:03.514 --> 02:05.908
En route to
a championship match,

02:05.951 --> 02:08.650
Rayburn and Jimbo
were lost at sea...

02:11.435 --> 02:14.090
and Stoker was left
without hope.

02:14.134 --> 02:16.310
[sirens wailing]

02:18.007 --> 02:20.792
But now, Stoker dares
to dream again.

02:20.836 --> 02:26.058
Jimbo'’s protégé, Siggy Marlon,
has found a new monster:

02:26.102 --> 02:28.017
Tentacular.

02:28.060 --> 02:31.847
Tonight, Stoker unveils
their newly renovated
Jimbo Coyle Stadium,

02:31.890 --> 02:37.200
where their phenom hopes
to claim the biggest prize
in sports:

02:37.244 --> 02:39.159
the Big Belt!

02:41.900 --> 02:44.773
[announcer]
Welcome to match night
at Jimbo Coyle Stadium,

02:44.816 --> 02:47.167
center of the monster
wrestling universe.

02:47.210 --> 02:49.430
[people chattering]

02:52.433 --> 02:55.175
Hey, Fred!Hiya, Winnie!

02:55.218 --> 02:57.612
Your new tentacle sign
looks amazing.

02:57.655 --> 03:01.181
Thanks, Winnie!
It'’s in honor of Tentacular!

03:01.224 --> 03:02.921
Pretty clever, huh?I love it.

03:02.965 --> 03:05.010
-Stoker!
-Stoker.

03:05.054 --> 03:07.012
-Stoker!
-Stoker!

03:07.056 --> 03:09.232
-Stoker!
-Stoker-- Aah!

03:09.276 --> 03:11.713
Wha--[both] Stoker!

03:11.756 --> 03:14.063
[all] Stoker!

03:14.106 --> 03:16.239
Wait!See you up there, Fred.

03:16.283 --> 03:18.894
Yep! Oh, I hope we win.

03:22.245 --> 03:25.509
[people chanting]
Tentacular! Tentacular!

03:25.553 --> 03:28.512
Tentacular! Tentacular!

03:28.556 --> 03:30.471
[exclaiming, cheering]

03:30.514 --> 03:33.169
[announcer speaking, indistinct]

03:33.213 --> 03:35.563
[people chanting, cheering]

03:41.221 --> 03:43.832
[sighs] Wish you were here
today, Dad.

03:47.966 --> 03:49.968
[exclaiming]

03:50.969 --> 03:54.103
Live in five, Mr. Remy.All right, ready?

03:54.146 --> 03:56.671
[exclaiming, gibbering]

03:57.976 --> 04:00.501
[announcer]
Slime Zone ticket holders
enter through gate C.

04:00.544 --> 04:02.981
-Hey, Winnie.
-Hey, Susie. Up top.

04:03.025 --> 04:04.896
Bring it.

04:04.940 --> 04:08.291
Oh! Oh, yeah!
This is gonna be awesome.

04:08.335 --> 04:09.771
-Whoop! Oh, sorry.
-Hey, Winnie!

04:09.814 --> 04:11.773
Pineapple-slaw dog with
extra ketchup coming at ya!

04:11.816 --> 04:14.732
Yes! Thank you, Hoppy.[shouts]

04:14.776 --> 04:17.561
[all exclaiming]

04:17.605 --> 04:20.564
[clerk] Fifteen dollars.
That'’s 22.54. Two for 25.

04:20.608 --> 04:25.090
There'’s enough for everyone.
Calm down. Everybody,
please be patient.

04:25.134 --> 04:26.831
Hey, Mom! Coming in hot.

04:26.875 --> 04:29.486
Oh. Thanks, Win.
Been a while since
we'’ve been this busy.

04:29.530 --> 04:31.923
-See you in the stands, Mom.
-That'’s 25 even.

04:31.967 --> 04:33.969
Coach Siggy,
as Jimbo'’s assistant,

04:34.012 --> 04:36.276
you were such a huge part
of Stoker'’s wrestling history.

04:36.319 --> 04:39.061
Now you have a chance
to make your own
with Tentacular.

04:39.104 --> 04:41.324
But first, you gotta beat
the champ tonight.

04:41.368 --> 04:43.239
King Gorge was
a great champ.

04:43.283 --> 04:46.329
But he'’s never fought
anyone like Tentacular.

04:46.373 --> 04:48.853
Oh, man!
Siggy wants this
in the worst way.

04:48.897 --> 04:51.116
No, way, bro.
Two rounds, and it'’s over.

04:51.160 --> 04:52.901
It'’s gonna be Tentacular
in the third.

04:52.944 --> 04:55.077
Dude,
that'’s Winnie Coyle!

04:55.120 --> 04:57.558
[chuckles] You know it.Jimbo'’s daughter?

04:57.601 --> 05:00.169
-No way, bro.
-You got this.

05:00.212 --> 05:01.301
Hey, Carl.Hey, Winnie.

05:01.344 --> 05:03.041
Wearing
your lucky socks?

05:03.085 --> 05:04.695
Going on
three weeks now.

05:04.739 --> 05:05.827
[sniffing]

05:05.870 --> 05:09.657
Smells like... victory![exclaiming]

05:12.137 --> 05:13.965

05:35.900 --> 05:38.990
[announcer]
World Monster Wrestling
presents

05:39.034 --> 05:42.080
The Smackdown in Stoker!

05:43.430 --> 05:45.997
Live from Stoker-on-Avon,
I'’m Marc Remy,

05:46.041 --> 05:47.521
welcoming you at home

05:47.564 --> 05:49.827
to the biggest night
of monster wrestling
in years,

05:49.871 --> 05:53.222
right here in the house
that Rayburn and Jimbo built.

05:53.265 --> 05:55.006
And I'’m
Lights Out McGinty,

05:55.050 --> 05:58.009
and I could not be
more excited.[groans]

05:58.053 --> 06:01.012
But with that excitement
comes some sadness, Marc.

06:01.056 --> 06:03.450
I can'’t believe
it'’s been nine years

06:03.493 --> 06:06.322
since we tragically lost
Rayburn and Jimbo.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.803
Nobody was greater.
We all miss them.

06:08.846 --> 06:12.197
[crowd chanting]
Rayburn! Jimbo!

06:12.241 --> 06:15.331
[Marc] Just listen
to this crowd.
Boy, this is special!

06:15.375 --> 06:18.378
Jimbo! Rayburn! Oh!

06:18.421 --> 06:20.902
But now
we are moments away

06:20.945 --> 06:23.208
from seeing
if Tentacular can bring

06:23.252 --> 06:26.386
the glory days
back to Stoker.

06:26.429 --> 06:30.825
Welcome, monster wrestling fans
from every corner of the globe.

06:30.868 --> 06:35.133
For tonight, we wrestle
for the Big Belt!

06:35.177 --> 06:38.354
-Yeah!
-Stoker!

06:38.398 --> 06:42.489
And now,
from Stoker-on-Avon,

06:42.532 --> 06:45.405
the hometown hero,

06:45.448 --> 06:47.537
the challenger,

06:47.581 --> 06:51.846
Tentacular!

06:51.889 --> 06:55.110
Yeah! [laughs]
Light '’em up!

06:55.153 --> 06:57.460
[upbeat music playing]

06:58.983 --> 07:01.246
-[McGinty] The new
pride of Stoker...
-Oh, yeah!

07:01.290 --> 07:02.900
...is in the house!

07:02.944 --> 07:05.729
He'’s ready.
Look at him go.

07:05.773 --> 07:07.209
Do it for Stoker, T!

07:07.252 --> 07:09.994
[Marc laughs]
Just listen to that passion.

07:10.038 --> 07:11.431
Yeah! Tentacular!

07:11.474 --> 07:15.304
I'’ve got your whole life story
tattooed on my body!

07:15.347 --> 07:19.090
Whoa, whoa. I hope
you saved room for the win
I'’m gonna have tonight.

07:19.134 --> 07:23.791
[McGinty] He just tore
through the Western Division
to set up this match.

07:23.834 --> 07:27.055
-Cheese!
-[Marc] Yes, sir.
He sure did.

07:28.143 --> 07:31.015
Who wants a selfie? I do!Oh, yeah!

07:31.059 --> 07:32.582
[chuckles] Hey-o!

07:32.626 --> 07:34.628
I'’m so pretty!

07:37.718 --> 07:39.284
[McGinty]
Look at those muscles!

07:39.328 --> 07:43.114
The guy'’s traps
are busting out
of his neck, Marc.

07:43.158 --> 07:45.639
Yeah, T! Pop those pecs!

07:45.682 --> 07:48.380
Come on, come get
some of this. Here I am.

07:48.424 --> 07:50.034
Uh-huh!

07:50.078 --> 07:53.385
[announcer]
Here comes the king.

07:53.429 --> 07:55.257
[fanfare playing]

07:55.300 --> 07:57.520
Sixty-two feet
of pure pain.

07:57.564 --> 08:02.699
The slimy limey!
The no-bull British bulldog!

08:03.352 --> 08:06.877
King Gorge!

08:06.921 --> 08:07.748
[roars]

08:07.791 --> 08:10.011
[upbeat music playing]

08:10.054 --> 08:11.360
Boo!

08:11.403 --> 08:13.928
Bow to your king.

08:13.971 --> 08:17.366
Bad dog! Bad dog!You'’re going down, Gorge!

08:17.409 --> 08:21.588
[McGinty]
Listen to the crowd.
They are heated!

08:21.631 --> 08:24.068
[Marc] This home crowd
does not like the king.

08:24.112 --> 08:27.028
-No one'’s bowing
in this stadium.
-Boo! Boo!

08:30.031 --> 08:31.859
[roars]

08:32.642 --> 08:35.166
[exclaiming]

08:35.210 --> 08:39.344
[ring announcer]
Ladies and gentlemen
and monsters!

08:39.388 --> 08:44.393
-Let'’s get ready to rumble!
-[both growling]

08:44.436 --> 08:46.874
I am so ready for this.

08:46.917 --> 08:48.440
You ready?
Who needs a stress ball?

08:48.484 --> 08:50.617
You look stressed, Maddie.
Here'’s a stress ball.

08:50.660 --> 08:53.315
I got you.
Take a stress ball.[bell rings]

08:53.358 --> 08:56.797
[Marc]
And this championship match
is officially under--

08:56.840 --> 08:59.495
This is awesome!
Spectacular! Electrifying!

08:59.539 --> 09:01.410
Whatever word
you wanna come up with!

09:01.453 --> 09:03.194
Okay.
Breathe, Fred. Breathe.

09:03.238 --> 09:05.109
There it is:
the Inverted Cloverleaf.

09:05.153 --> 09:07.242
Siggy got that
right out of Dad'’s playbook.

09:07.285 --> 09:09.200
He might have this, Fred.

09:09.244 --> 09:11.594
Come on. I'’m not watching.
I'’m watching,
but I'’m not watching.

09:11.638 --> 09:13.378
[wrestler groans]Oh, wake up, ref!

09:13.422 --> 09:15.598
That'’s a gill gouge, again!

09:15.642 --> 09:19.254
[Winnie scoffs]
What is he doing?
He'’s gotta stick to the plan!

09:19.297 --> 09:23.737
Gorge is doing the Irish Whip
into the Flying Right-Hook
Lariat every time!

09:23.780 --> 09:26.478
Come on, T.
Don'’t let him get the--

09:26.522 --> 09:28.045
Watch that Elbow Smash!

09:28.089 --> 09:30.395
[Marc] Tentacular came in
to this match the hot favorite.

09:30.439 --> 09:32.920
But the wily old champ,
he'’s got some other ideas.

09:32.963 --> 09:34.486
Did you see that?Yeah. I saw it.

09:34.530 --> 09:36.488
He licked his nose again.
You saw that, right?Yeah.

09:36.532 --> 09:39.579
Just before he looked up--
There! He did it again.

09:39.622 --> 09:41.711
Did what?
I'’m not watching!

09:42.669 --> 09:44.235
It'’s so...I know, right?

09:45.280 --> 09:46.890
...obvious.

09:48.022 --> 09:49.545
Winnie!
Where you going?

09:49.589 --> 09:51.678
Sorry! Watch your head.

09:51.721 --> 09:54.594
-Hey!
-My bad! Watch your back!
Sorry.

09:54.637 --> 09:56.334
Whoops! Heads up!

09:59.250 --> 10:00.425
Whoa! Whoa!

10:00.469 --> 10:01.992
[exclaims]

10:05.300 --> 10:09.217
[Marc] Ooh! Gorge has got him
in the Chickenwing
Over-the-shoulder Dropface.

10:09.260 --> 10:14.091
[McGinty] Oh! And Tentacular
is in real trouble
early in this match.

10:14.135 --> 10:16.050
I'’m gonna go out
on a limb here and say

10:16.093 --> 10:19.836
that we'’re in for
another coronation
of King Gorge.

10:19.880 --> 10:23.100
-[bell rings]
-[Marc] There goes that round.

10:23.144 --> 10:25.276
What are you doing?
This is your chance.

10:25.320 --> 10:28.671
Listen to me.
Look at me. Focus, T.
Remember the game plan.

10:28.715 --> 10:32.632
Get him up on his hind legs,
and then you wrap him
up with your tentacles--

10:32.675 --> 10:34.546
Wait a second! Wait.
He'’s got--

10:34.590 --> 10:36.548
Winnie!He'’s got a tell!

10:36.592 --> 10:39.769
How many times do I have
to tell you? Ringside'’s
no place for no little girl.

10:39.813 --> 10:41.771
He licks his nose
every time.

10:41.815 --> 10:43.512
What are you talking about?

10:43.555 --> 10:45.340
He licks
before he strikes!

10:45.383 --> 10:47.429
Is Winnie right, Sig?

10:52.173 --> 10:55.132
You'’re a good boy, aren't you?
Yes, you are.

10:55.176 --> 10:58.092
Good boy.
Who'’s a good boy, then?

10:59.049 --> 11:01.878
Pull up your socks
and take this guy out.

11:01.922 --> 11:04.098
[bell rings]Good call, Winnie.

11:07.449 --> 11:09.843
[snarling]

11:13.455 --> 11:15.065
Ah! Yeah!

11:22.986 --> 11:25.162
-Yes!
-Whoa!

11:25.859 --> 11:28.165
Yay! Go, Tentacular, go!

11:30.733 --> 11:32.474
Yeah, T! Finish him!

11:38.393 --> 11:42.092
[McGinty exclaims][Marc] T with the Shark Fin
Super Stunner!

11:47.663 --> 11:49.752
-He'’s out!
-[bell ringing]

11:49.796 --> 11:52.059
[cheering]

11:52.102 --> 11:55.758
We did it, Sig.
Stoker'’s back on top.

11:55.802 --> 11:58.413
Yeah, yeah.
Yeah, sure is, kid.

11:58.456 --> 12:02.765
Oh, yeah, Stoker!
I'’m going to an unnamed
theme park!

12:02.809 --> 12:04.549
[laughing]

12:04.593 --> 12:06.290
T, get over here,
big guy.

12:06.334 --> 12:08.684
You did it.
You are the champion.

12:08.728 --> 12:11.600
You got the job done.
Can you tell us
what this means to you?

12:11.643 --> 12:15.865
Marc, let me tell you.
This means so much
to Tentacular.

12:15.909 --> 12:19.564
But first,
I just have to thank Stoker.

12:19.608 --> 12:22.132
I love you, Tentacular!

12:22.176 --> 12:25.919
Oh, this town,
you have given Tentacular

12:25.962 --> 12:28.312
everything Tentacular needed

12:28.356 --> 12:31.620
to realize
Tentacular'’s dream!

12:31.663 --> 12:33.840
I love you, Stoker!

12:33.883 --> 12:36.059
[all] Aw!

12:36.103 --> 12:37.626
So, thank you, Stoker.

12:37.669 --> 12:42.065
You will always have
a special place in my heart

12:42.109 --> 12:44.764
as the place
that Tentacular left

12:44.807 --> 12:48.593
to go somewhere much,
much better.

12:48.637 --> 12:50.334
-What?
-Huh?

12:50.378 --> 12:51.988
What?

12:52.032 --> 12:54.817
Are you serious?
You'’re really leaving Stoker?

12:54.861 --> 12:56.514
Of course, Marc.

12:56.558 --> 13:00.083
I'’m about to make history.
My own history.

13:00.127 --> 13:04.871
Can'’t do that in Stoker.
There'’s too much history
here already.

13:06.873 --> 13:10.615
That'’s why I'm taking
my talents to Slitherpoole.

13:10.659 --> 13:11.791
No!

13:11.834 --> 13:14.184
What'’s happening, Daddy?

13:14.228 --> 13:17.057
Why? Why?

13:17.971 --> 13:19.537
Jimothy! Come here.

13:19.581 --> 13:23.106
This is my ticket to bigger
and brighter things, Marc.

13:23.150 --> 13:27.589
Oh, ho, ho!
Just let me finish
this killer tweet.

13:27.632 --> 13:29.983
Marc, you look good.
Can we take a quick pic?

13:30.026 --> 13:32.115
And send. Perfect. Okay.

13:32.159 --> 13:33.769
That is right, Marc.

13:33.813 --> 13:37.817
Now the big guy
can actually win
somewhere that matters,

13:37.860 --> 13:40.123
on a stage as big
and beautiful--

13:40.167 --> 13:42.212
you know you are--
as he is.

13:42.256 --> 13:44.780
I'’m talking about Slitherpoole.

13:44.824 --> 13:47.261
And, Marc, can I just give
a big shout-out to Pop-Pop

13:47.304 --> 13:49.045
for buying me the franchise?

13:49.089 --> 13:53.484
We did it! Anything is possible!
Thank you, Pop-Pop.

13:55.051 --> 13:59.839
So thank you again, Stoker.
Much love. T out.

13:59.882 --> 14:01.841
[upbeat music playing]

14:01.884 --> 14:03.494
[feedback squeals]

14:03.538 --> 14:07.585
Come on, Sig.
Time for the T train
to leave the station.

14:07.629 --> 14:10.937
I'’m sorry, Winnie.
I gotta go where he goes.

14:16.899 --> 14:21.121
[audience booing, jeering]

14:30.478 --> 14:32.610
[Marc] The sports world
is absolutely abuzz

14:32.654 --> 14:35.918
with Tentacular'’s
shocking departure
from Stoker last night.

14:35.962 --> 14:38.965
Why did I buy
this stupid sign?

14:39.008 --> 14:41.402
-You gotta be kidding.
-What do we do?

14:41.445 --> 14:43.186
Can you believe it?
I can'’t.

14:43.230 --> 14:45.188
Mom,
are we gonna be okay?

14:45.232 --> 14:47.887
I don'’t know, hon,
but we'’ve been
through worse.

14:47.930 --> 14:51.891
"Do you want neon?"
"Sure," I said.
"Money'’s no object."

14:51.934 --> 14:53.718
Have you seen
my hair salon?

14:53.762 --> 14:57.809
Your hair salon?
What about that tattoo
I just got on my--

14:57.853 --> 14:59.942
[all clamoring]

14:59.986 --> 15:03.119
All right everybody,
now, settle down.
Just settle down.

15:03.163 --> 15:05.034
[clears throat]

15:05.078 --> 15:06.731
Look,
I know you'’re all worried.

15:06.775 --> 15:10.518
After all, each of us owns
a piece of Stoker Stadium.

15:10.561 --> 15:13.260
But what
you don'’t realize is

15:13.303 --> 15:17.568
that things are actually
much, much worse
than you know.

15:17.612 --> 15:19.179
Hang on. What?

15:19.222 --> 15:22.051
Uh, our councilwoman
over here can explain
everything to you.

15:22.095 --> 15:23.966
Probably her fault
anyway.

15:24.010 --> 15:27.535
Wow. Thank you so much,
Mr. Mayor.

15:27.578 --> 15:29.406
Pretty sure
it'’s your fault, though.

15:29.450 --> 15:31.539
Okay, let me
make it simple.

15:32.018 --> 15:34.237
Very simple.

15:34.281 --> 15:38.067
The stadium costs
lots of money. Okay?

15:38.111 --> 15:42.811
No monster means
no money.

15:42.854 --> 15:46.815
No money means
no stadium.

15:46.858 --> 15:49.470
Which is bad for Stoker.

15:51.820 --> 15:55.084
Oh, my gosh!
Remember when Pittsmore
lost LeBrontosaurus?

15:55.128 --> 15:56.607
[all] Not Pittsmore!

15:56.651 --> 15:58.653
That'’s right.
All they have left

15:58.696 --> 16:01.264
is that illegal
monster wrestling club

16:01.308 --> 16:03.875
in that abandoned
bobblehead factory.

16:03.919 --> 16:06.791
[thunder crashes][voices scream]

16:06.835 --> 16:10.012
Ooh.
Scary lightning.
[imitates wind gust]

16:10.056 --> 16:11.666
Okay, hold on,
everybody.

16:11.709 --> 16:15.061
I'’m here to tell you
that there is a solution.

16:15.104 --> 16:17.454
The owner of
the Slitherpoole franchise

16:17.498 --> 16:20.892
has offered us a lot of money
to buy the stadium.

16:20.936 --> 16:23.112
Yes!We'’re saved.

16:23.156 --> 16:25.071
Yes, yes, that is great.

16:25.114 --> 16:29.075
He'’s gonna blow up the stadium
and turn it into a parking lot.

16:29.118 --> 16:31.251
-What?
-What?

16:31.294 --> 16:33.383
-A parking lot?
-Yes!

16:33.427 --> 16:36.473
With shuttle service
to Slitherpoole.

16:36.517 --> 16:40.173
You can'’t do that
to the Jimbo Coyle Stadium!
That'’s-- No!

16:40.216 --> 16:43.654
Sorry. The whole town
will go bankrupt
unless we sell to Jimothy.

16:43.698 --> 16:46.788
But without monster wrestling,
we'’re not Stoker.

16:46.831 --> 16:49.138
-We'’ll have nothing.
-We'’ll have a parking lot.

16:49.182 --> 16:53.142
You can'’t just tear down
everything my dad
and Rayburn built here.

16:53.186 --> 16:54.622
They never quit.

16:54.665 --> 16:56.841
You know what
my dad always said?

16:56.885 --> 16:59.192
"When you get knocked down,
you get back up."

16:59.235 --> 17:01.759
Getting back up isn'’t gonna
pay my bills, Winnie.

17:01.803 --> 17:05.067
I invested
everything in him.What am I supposed to do?

17:05.111 --> 17:06.634
Winnie, look, I'’m sorry.

17:06.677 --> 17:09.724
The loans on the stadium
are due in 90 days.

17:09.767 --> 17:13.641
And if you think we can
replace a champion
like Tentacular before then,

17:13.684 --> 17:16.818
that-- that'’s just--
it'’s crazy!

17:18.167 --> 17:21.214
Get real.We'’re doomed.

17:58.599 --> 18:01.210
[crowd cheering]

18:01.254 --> 18:03.778
[ring announcer]
And in the blue corner,

18:03.821 --> 18:06.476
the hometown hero:

18:06.520 --> 18:09.653
Rayburn!

18:11.177 --> 18:13.744
Hey, Win,
what do you think?

18:13.788 --> 18:18.140
It'’s gonna be tough,
but Rayburn has one thing
Gargantuan doesn'’t.

18:18.184 --> 18:20.186
Oh. What'’s that?

18:20.229 --> 18:21.578
You, Dad.

18:21.622 --> 18:23.754
[chuckling]
Better watch out, Siggy.

18:23.798 --> 18:26.583
Looks like Jimbo'’s got himself
a new assistant coach.

18:26.627 --> 18:29.717
You'’re a riot, Rayburn.
Now can we please
focus on the match?

18:29.760 --> 18:33.112
Okay, Rayburn.
You know what to do.

18:33.155 --> 18:36.419
Everything we need to win
is in here,

18:36.463 --> 18:39.814
in here, and in here.

18:40.423 --> 18:42.991
Now, go make
Stoker proud.

18:43.034 --> 18:45.124
[announcer]
And here we go!

18:46.777 --> 18:48.170
Take him down!

18:49.171 --> 18:50.955
And there it is!
The Reverse STO

18:50.999 --> 18:54.176
and another championship
for Rayburn,
the greatest of all time!

18:54.220 --> 18:57.179
He did it!
He got the Big Belt, Dad!

18:59.660 --> 19:01.618
[gasps]

19:06.797 --> 19:10.540
Bye, Mom! I'’m going to Pittsmore
to find Stoker a new monster.

19:10.584 --> 19:11.541
What? No.

19:11.585 --> 19:13.587
This isn'’t
your responsibility.

19:13.630 --> 19:16.198
You don'’t have to do this.It'’s what Dad
would have done.

19:16.242 --> 19:20.637
I'’m Jimbo Coyle's daughter.
How can I do anything less?

19:22.944 --> 19:26.382
[person]
Now approaching the station,
the Pittsmore Local.

19:35.478 --> 19:38.177
[person 2]
Last stop, Pittsmore.What? Wha--

19:45.923 --> 19:48.578
[upbeat music playing]

19:48.622 --> 19:50.232
[sighs]

19:50.276 --> 19:52.539
[people whooping, cheering]

19:57.892 --> 19:59.633
[bodies thudding]

20:00.895 --> 20:02.897
[cat snarls][gasps]

20:05.204 --> 20:07.380
[crowd cheering]

20:12.994 --> 20:15.866
[crowd chanting] Axehammer!
Axehammer! Axehammer!

20:15.910 --> 20:17.128
Hey, watch it!

20:17.172 --> 20:19.305
Five minutes till bets close!
Place your bets!

20:20.306 --> 20:22.264
[monster roars]Sorry.

20:24.266 --> 20:26.137
Yeah!

20:26.181 --> 20:30.359
Come on, give me a challenge.
Axehammer wants a challenge!

20:30.403 --> 20:32.535
[wrestler]
Ah! Just take it easy.

20:32.579 --> 20:35.843
[Axehammer] Oh, you want
some more of that? You want
some more of the Axehammer?

20:35.886 --> 20:38.715
No, bro! No, no,
no, no, no, no--
[groans]

20:38.759 --> 20:40.064
[chuckles]

20:40.108 --> 20:41.283
[roars]

20:41.327 --> 20:44.112
That is so much pain, bro.
[screams]

20:44.155 --> 20:45.418
Ooh!

20:45.461 --> 20:48.769
You like that?
Axehammer is the man!

20:48.812 --> 20:50.727
[laughing]

20:50.771 --> 20:53.643
[crowd chanting]
Defenestrate! Defenestrate!

20:53.687 --> 20:56.385
[chanting continues][exclaiming]

21:00.607 --> 21:01.564
Ooh.

21:01.608 --> 21:03.827
[wrestler screams, body thuds]

21:03.871 --> 21:05.960
[roaring]

21:06.003 --> 21:08.571
Just think about it.
Sign up with Stoker.

21:08.615 --> 21:11.008
I can get you matches
in a real stadium.

21:11.052 --> 21:12.923
You'’ll be wrestling
in the big leagues,

21:12.967 --> 21:16.536
and, as a bonus,
you'’ll get me
as your coach!

21:16.579 --> 21:18.842
It'’s a win-win-Winnie!
[chuckles]

21:20.627 --> 21:22.629
You'’re the coach, huh?

21:38.471 --> 21:39.907
Oh, too much.

21:39.950 --> 21:43.824
And me as your coach.
It'’s a win-win-Winnie!

21:45.652 --> 21:47.001
It'’s a win-win-Winnie?

21:48.437 --> 21:50.396
-Win-win-Winnie?
-[braying]

21:50.439 --> 21:51.832
Winnie?

21:53.747 --> 21:55.836
Another root beer
on the rocks.

21:57.533 --> 21:59.100
[glass shatters]Ugh!

21:59.143 --> 22:00.623
Tough night, huh?

22:00.667 --> 22:03.496
Eh, don'’t worry. Your luck's
gotta change, right?

22:03.539 --> 22:04.975
I mean, look at me.

22:05.019 --> 22:08.327
I just put
every last cent
I have on that guy.

22:08.370 --> 22:10.416
[Winnie]
Uh, the guy with the tusks?

22:10.459 --> 22:11.982
Looks like a pretty sure thing.

22:12.026 --> 22:16.857
No. The slobby-looking guy
with the horns.

22:16.900 --> 22:18.467
[Winnie] Oh!

22:18.511 --> 22:21.209
That there is
Steve the Stupendous.

22:21.252 --> 22:24.647
-He'’s...
-He'’s never won
a single match.

22:24.691 --> 22:26.388
He'’s a thousand-to-one odds!

22:26.432 --> 22:29.391
He wins,
I get a hundred grand!

22:29.435 --> 22:31.785
Okay, you asked for it.

22:31.828 --> 22:34.570
Get ready for the Moon Boom!

22:34.614 --> 22:38.052
-[gasps]
-Get ready for the Moon Boom!

22:38.661 --> 22:40.750
Oh, careful, Son.

22:40.794 --> 22:41.925
[giggling]

22:43.405 --> 22:46.321
Rayburn Jr.?
This is perfect!

22:46.365 --> 22:47.540
[chuckles] Huh?

22:47.583 --> 22:49.280
-Wha--
-[gasps]

22:49.324 --> 22:52.414
I said, here it comes!

22:52.458 --> 22:55.939
Bring it on,
you sack of warm puke.

22:55.983 --> 22:59.639
Oh, I'’m bringing
the warm puke.
Don'’t worry.

22:59.682 --> 23:02.511
There'’s gonna be a lot of puke
coming outta me,

23:02.555 --> 23:04.861
which is obviously
super gross.

23:04.905 --> 23:07.037
You know, um,
I can'’t jump that far.

23:07.081 --> 23:08.735
Why did you have to
climb up there?

23:08.778 --> 23:11.825
I thought it would look cool.
This looks cool, right?

23:11.868 --> 23:13.261
This sucks!

23:13.304 --> 23:16.307
You suck! Just come closer.

23:16.351 --> 23:18.571
Rayburn Jr.!
What are you doing here?

23:18.614 --> 23:20.660
Hmm? [exclaiming]

23:21.835 --> 23:22.792
Dang it.

23:22.836 --> 23:24.359
Come on, man.
What are you doing?

23:24.403 --> 23:26.883
You'’re supposed to
land on me.
Then I reverse you--

23:26.927 --> 23:28.755
-Ray-Ray! Yoo-hoo! Up here!
-Who is Ray?

23:28.798 --> 23:30.713
No one.
I'’ve never heard of Ray.

23:30.757 --> 23:33.107
Did you see that?
Yeah, Steve!

23:33.150 --> 23:36.502
Quit messing around, Steve.
You'’re supposed to lose.

23:36.545 --> 23:38.939
What'’s wrong with you?[chuckles] Nothing.

23:38.982 --> 23:42.682
Stick to the script, fellas.
Don'’t wanna get
the boss upset, do we?

23:44.292 --> 23:47.817
No, we do not. Okay, Klonk,
let'’s end this with a bang.

23:47.861 --> 23:49.515
I'’m gonna go for
the Kesagiri Chop,

23:49.558 --> 23:52.735
but you catch it
and finish me off
with a Reverse Clothesline.

23:52.779 --> 23:55.434
[chuckles] Classic.

23:55.477 --> 23:57.305
This little piggy'’s
coming home!

23:57.348 --> 24:00.917
Hey! Over here! Rayburn,
I can'’t believe it's you!

24:00.961 --> 24:04.443
-This has gotta be fate.
-Hey, get off the ropes, kid.

24:04.486 --> 24:07.576
Steve,
just go down already.Got it.

24:07.620 --> 24:10.579
Sorry, buddy.
Just clothesline me.

24:11.580 --> 24:14.714
Ray-Ray, come on.
It'’s me, Winnie Coyle!

24:14.757 --> 24:16.629
Uh-oh.
Would you get outta here?

24:16.672 --> 24:19.458
Rayburn, when you'’re done
doing whatever this is,
we should talk.

24:19.501 --> 24:21.808
I said, get outta here!

24:25.333 --> 24:26.987
No!

24:30.381 --> 24:32.166
-[crowd exclaims]
-Oh, no.

24:35.648 --> 24:38.215
-Uh, one.
-[monster snarls]

24:38.259 --> 24:40.130
-[gasps]
-Two.

24:40.174 --> 24:41.958
Klonk! You gotta get up.

24:42.002 --> 24:43.525
Three...Get up, get up!

24:43.569 --> 24:45.832
And Steve the Stupendous
seems to be trying--

24:45.875 --> 24:48.138
unsuccessfully--
to lose now.

24:48.182 --> 24:50.445
Six. Seven.He'’s up, he's up!

24:50.489 --> 24:53.492
-Eight. Nine.
-Really?

24:53.535 --> 24:55.624
Nine and a half.Come on, Klonk!

24:55.668 --> 24:57.234
Nine and three-quarters.

24:58.584 --> 25:01.935
Get up, Klonk.Nine and nine-tenths!

25:01.978 --> 25:04.633
Ugh. Ten. Takedown.[bell rings]

25:04.677 --> 25:06.505
Fight'’s over.[gasps]

25:06.548 --> 25:09.159
I won! I won, I won!

25:09.203 --> 25:10.552
[gasps]

25:10.596 --> 25:13.033
[buzzer sounding]

25:14.295 --> 25:15.818
[gasps]

25:18.560 --> 25:19.779
I'’m out of here.

25:19.822 --> 25:22.303
[door creaking][gasps]

25:22.346 --> 25:25.088
Oh. Whoa.
Hey, Denise.

25:25.132 --> 25:27.656
Where do you think
you'’re going, Steve?

25:27.700 --> 25:30.267
Uh, nowhere.

25:38.624 --> 25:40.669
[sinister chuckle]

25:40.713 --> 25:43.716
Steve. Steve.[people gasping]

25:43.759 --> 25:47.023
Steve, Steve,
Stevie, Stevie, Steve.

26:02.299 --> 26:06.303
Looks like we have
a little bit
of a problem, Stevie.

26:06.347 --> 26:09.698
I paid you
to lose tonight,

26:09.742 --> 26:12.353
like I do every night.

26:12.396 --> 26:15.617
It was an accident, I swear.
You know me. I love to lose.

26:15.661 --> 26:17.532
I'’m the best loser
in the biz.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.490
Yes, you were.

26:19.534 --> 26:21.231
[laughing] I won!

26:21.275 --> 26:24.583
I won a hundred grand!
I can go to college now!

26:24.626 --> 26:29.675
Do you know what happens
to those who betray Lady Mayhen?

26:30.284 --> 26:31.633
Very...Yeah?

26:31.677 --> 26:33.156
...bad...Uh-huh.

26:33.200 --> 26:35.245
...painful things.

26:35.289 --> 26:38.988
[chuckles]
Lady Mayhen wants her money.

26:39.032 --> 26:40.860
Listen,
I'’ll make it up to you.

26:40.903 --> 26:43.819
I'’ll wrestle for free.
I'’ll clean the toilets.
Whatever you want.

26:44.777 --> 26:48.432
You know what I really want?
The money, honey!

26:48.476 --> 26:51.958
All of it, times ten.

26:52.001 --> 26:54.134
Honestly,
I'’m not great with math,

26:54.177 --> 26:56.440
but I don'’t know how
I'’m ever gonna be able
to pay you.

26:56.484 --> 26:59.356
-I think I can help.
-I don'’t know you.
I don'’t know her!

26:59.400 --> 27:03.839
Sure, you do. It'’s me.
Winnie Coyle? Come on.
You remember me, Rayb--

27:03.883 --> 27:06.233
My name is Steve.Hello!

27:06.276 --> 27:09.628
I hate to interrupt
this charming little
reunion you'’re having,

27:09.671 --> 27:12.456
but, Steve, there'’s still
the matter of my money.

27:12.500 --> 27:16.939
I don'’t want to see you again
until you have all of it.

27:16.983 --> 27:20.116
Every last dollar bill.

27:21.552 --> 27:23.816
Oh, Klonk! Where are you?

27:23.859 --> 27:27.820
Clock is ticking, Steve.
Ticktock, ticktock.

27:28.690 --> 27:30.344
Whoa!

27:30.387 --> 27:32.389
[grunts, groans]

27:32.433 --> 27:34.827
Hey! Wait up!

27:34.870 --> 27:37.133
Man, I never thought
I'’d see you again.

27:37.177 --> 27:39.309
Oh, won'’t you just
leave me alone?

27:39.353 --> 27:43.531
Just hear me out.
I can help you get that money.

27:43.574 --> 27:45.533
Tentacular turned heel
and bailed,

27:45.576 --> 27:48.579
and you probably saw that,
along with everyone else
in the stinking world,

27:48.623 --> 27:49.798
which was awesome.

27:49.842 --> 27:52.758
But that means
Stoker needs a monster.

27:52.801 --> 27:54.760
Yeah, no.

27:54.803 --> 27:56.239
Listen to me.

27:56.283 --> 27:59.155
I can help you.
Just come with me to Stoker.

27:59.199 --> 28:02.985
I'’m not going back...
to that place that
I'’ve never been.

28:04.073 --> 28:07.163
Ha! Wow. You are not
good at lying, Rayburn.

28:07.207 --> 28:10.166
Hey, kid.
You got the wrong monster.

28:10.210 --> 28:12.821
I don'’t think so, Rayburn.

28:12.865 --> 28:17.696
Rayburn was my dad.
And I'’m not gonna cash in
on his name. Ever.

28:17.739 --> 28:20.176
[laughs] I knew it!
I knew it was you!

28:20.220 --> 28:22.352
[groans]I mean, it'’s been forever,

28:22.396 --> 28:24.833
and I was yea small,
and you were yea tall,

28:24.877 --> 28:26.269
and now you'’re, like, yea!

28:26.313 --> 28:28.924
Hey, you think
monster puberty was easy?

28:28.968 --> 28:32.623
Sorry. This is a real thing
I'’m offering you.

28:32.667 --> 28:34.103
Look, I have my dad'’s playbook.

28:34.147 --> 28:36.932
I could coach you up,
get you a big match in Stoker,

28:36.976 --> 28:39.543
and, boom,
both our problems are solved.

28:39.587 --> 28:43.286
[chuckling] You think
you'’re gonna coach me?

28:45.245 --> 28:47.029
Oh, Stevie!

28:47.073 --> 28:51.033
What are you still doing here?
Go get me my money, man!

28:52.513 --> 28:53.732
Help me.

28:53.775 --> 28:56.517
Oh, Klonk,
you'’re on mani-pedi duty.

28:56.560 --> 28:58.214
[Klonk] Oh, no. No!

28:58.258 --> 28:59.128
So, Coach...

28:59.172 --> 29:01.304
[clears throat] Stoker?Yes!

29:03.176 --> 29:06.788
Isn'’t this just great?
It'’ll just be like old times
again, you know?

29:06.832 --> 29:10.270
Pretty sure that doesn'’t
mean the same thing
to me as it does to you.

29:10.313 --> 29:14.448
Hey. Are you gonna make me
walk to Stoker?

29:14.491 --> 29:15.971
Yep. I am.

29:16.755 --> 29:18.234
All the way?All the way.

29:18.278 --> 29:20.628
Come on.
Just give me a ride, Rayburn.

29:20.671 --> 29:23.370
Never call me
that name again.

29:23.413 --> 29:27.417
Okay. I'’ll never
call you that again...
if you give me a ride.

29:27.461 --> 29:28.767
[groans]

29:32.292 --> 29:33.946
[yawns]

29:39.647 --> 29:41.257
Comfy up there?

29:41.301 --> 29:44.913
You must be exhausted
from ruining my life.

29:44.957 --> 29:47.611
Need a pillow?
Maybe a chocolate?

29:47.655 --> 29:50.440
Sorry we don'’t provide
turndown service.

29:56.359 --> 29:58.013
[sighs]

30:08.894 --> 30:10.373
Whoa.

30:12.854 --> 30:16.945
Wow. This place
hasn'’t changed a bit.

30:16.989 --> 30:20.122
[Winnie] I know.
It'’s magical, isn't it?

30:20.166 --> 30:21.820
It'’s still got that--
[sniffs]

30:21.863 --> 30:25.040
mmm, that smell
of sweat and feet.

30:25.084 --> 30:27.260
Ah. Really big feet.

30:28.087 --> 30:31.090
You'’re a real weird kid.
Real weird.

30:31.133 --> 30:33.135
[Winnie] Yeah, I know.
[chuckles]

30:33.179 --> 30:36.835
You know, Steve,
you'’re not the first person
to say that to me, actually.

30:36.878 --> 30:38.401
You'’re really not.

30:49.935 --> 30:51.501
Whoo!

30:53.025 --> 30:55.679
It looks
just like you, Dad.

30:55.723 --> 30:57.986
You wanna live up
to the Rayburn name?Yeah.

30:58.030 --> 31:02.556
It'’s gonna take a lot more
than some fancy dance moves,
Junior.

31:02.599 --> 31:04.384
Time to get serious.

31:06.603 --> 31:07.996
[Winnie] Steve?

31:08.736 --> 31:10.085
Steve?

31:10.607 --> 31:12.827
-Steve!
-[shouts]

31:12.871 --> 31:16.004
Are you okay?Oh, sure. Never better.

31:16.048 --> 31:17.571
[sighs]

31:21.053 --> 31:24.404
Look, I know
you don'’t wanna be here.

31:24.447 --> 31:29.365
And I'’m really sorry
that I messed things up
for you in Pittsmore.

31:29.931 --> 31:32.629
But if we don'’t do this,

31:32.673 --> 31:36.982
they'’re gonna knock down
the stadium and turn it
into a parking lot,

31:37.025 --> 31:39.375
and that'’s all
I have left of Dad.

31:39.419 --> 31:42.901
And your dad is
part of that too.A parking lot?

31:42.944 --> 31:44.250
Yep.

31:44.815 --> 31:46.252
No monster, no money.

31:46.295 --> 31:48.515
Maybe it'’s for the best.What?

31:48.558 --> 31:51.561
How can you say that?
That'’s our dads' legacy!

31:51.605 --> 31:55.435
I hate to break it to you,
but saving that stadium
won'’t bring him back.

31:55.478 --> 31:58.917
I know that. I just thought
you might actually care
about helping--

31:58.960 --> 32:03.095
Let'’s get something straight.
I love wrestling.
I loved my dad.

32:03.138 --> 32:04.705
But I'’m not gonna be him.

32:04.748 --> 32:06.533
Especially for you.

32:06.576 --> 32:07.969
I'’m gonna be me.

32:08.013 --> 32:10.841
And who are you, Steve?

32:10.885 --> 32:15.716
I'’m the guy
who'’s here for the money.
You got me?

32:15.759 --> 32:17.587
Oh, I got you.

32:17.631 --> 32:19.415
Money all the way.

32:20.895 --> 32:24.464
You should probably
get some rest.
We start training tomorrow.

32:24.507 --> 32:26.509
[chuckling]

32:26.553 --> 32:28.947
Training.
Yeah, right. Good one.

32:28.990 --> 32:31.340
6:00 a.m. Sharp.

32:31.993 --> 32:33.908
You'’re-- You'’re serious?

32:33.952 --> 32:35.997
[crickets chirping]

32:36.041 --> 32:38.521
-[alarm blaring]
-[gasps] What?

32:48.140 --> 32:50.272
-Good morning.
-Hi, Mom.

32:50.316 --> 32:53.014
How are you feeling?
You ready?

32:53.058 --> 32:54.885
[sighs]

32:54.929 --> 32:57.149
Do you think
I can do this?

32:57.192 --> 32:59.934
I think you won'’t know
until you try.

32:59.978 --> 33:01.457
Just remember:

33:01.501 --> 33:05.157
Train the monster you have,
not the one you wish you had.

33:05.200 --> 33:07.072
Did Dad say that?

33:07.115 --> 33:10.031
Uh, no.
Mom did, just now.

33:10.075 --> 33:11.990
[sighs] Okay.

33:12.033 --> 33:14.035
Hey. You forgetting
something?

33:14.079 --> 33:16.951
Oh. Mwah!
See you tonight.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.997
I meant these.

33:20.215 --> 33:22.304
Dad'’s keys?

33:23.044 --> 33:25.829
You tell Rayburn--
I mean, Steve--

33:25.873 --> 33:27.657
that Mrs. C says hi.

33:27.701 --> 33:29.007
Now, go coach him.

33:29.050 --> 33:30.660
Yes!

33:31.966 --> 33:34.099
[gasping]

33:37.058 --> 33:39.147
[shouting]

33:43.673 --> 33:44.892
Whoa!

33:44.935 --> 33:46.763
Whoo!

33:47.721 --> 33:49.853
Morning, Fred!Whoa!

33:49.897 --> 33:52.204
Namaste, Winnie!

33:56.773 --> 33:58.688
Whoo-hoo!

34:00.908 --> 34:02.127
Whoa!

34:06.435 --> 34:07.871
What-- Hey, come back!

34:07.915 --> 34:09.482
[door closes]

34:11.092 --> 34:12.485
Steve.

34:13.051 --> 34:14.443
You ready?

34:15.749 --> 34:17.881
Hey. Rise and shine.

34:17.925 --> 34:19.970
Hey, Steve, wake up!What?

34:20.014 --> 34:23.322
I had this terrible dream
that I promised I would
get up and train.

34:23.365 --> 34:24.540
Oh, it'’s real!

34:24.584 --> 34:26.977
So, are you ready?
Let'’s do this.

34:27.021 --> 34:29.676
Go ahead. You start.
Set up all the cones
or whatever.

34:29.719 --> 34:32.853
Oh, ho! No, you don'’t.
Up and at '’em, sunshine.

34:32.896 --> 34:37.205
It is go time. Game day.
Ain'’t no time like the present.

34:37.249 --> 34:39.468
Man, why can'’t I think of
more sports clichés?

34:39.512 --> 34:42.384
Uh... Well, until I do,
let'’s train.

34:42.428 --> 34:44.865
You are a rude little girl.

34:44.908 --> 34:47.215
Scooch your booty!
[grunting]

34:47.259 --> 34:49.043
This is important.

34:49.087 --> 34:50.610
With a capital I.

34:50.653 --> 34:55.180
Yeah, well,
I never really felt
training was important.

34:55.832 --> 34:57.399
I can tell.

34:57.443 --> 35:00.620
No one thinks we can do this,
but we'’re gonna show them.

35:03.884 --> 35:05.190
I'’m going back to sleep.

35:05.233 --> 35:07.105
You are not, mister!

35:07.148 --> 35:10.891
You just go get me that match,
and I'’ll take care of the rest.

35:12.327 --> 35:15.548
Okay. I'’ll get you a match.

35:16.810 --> 35:19.073
[hooting]

35:19.117 --> 35:23.121
[announcer] Welcome,
everyone, to an evening
of monster wrestling!

35:23.164 --> 35:24.731
Weighing in at 18 tons,

35:24.774 --> 35:28.430
you know him, you love him,
you'’re scared of him:

35:28.474 --> 35:32.608
Wham Bam
Ramarilla Jackson!

35:32.652 --> 35:35.568
Here comes the Rammer Hammer!

35:36.873 --> 35:40.225
-Rama, Rama, Rama!
-Rilla, Rilla, Rilla!

35:40.268 --> 35:43.880
Boom! Boom!
It'’s Ramarilla time!

35:45.752 --> 35:47.449
[exclaiming]

35:47.493 --> 35:49.973
Oh, wow. This guy'’s
a real showman.

35:50.017 --> 35:52.150
Okay. Everything we need

35:52.193 --> 35:54.804
is in here, in here,
and in--

35:54.848 --> 35:56.980
Oh, this is original.
Are you for real?

35:57.024 --> 35:59.809
What do you think
you'’re doing right now?I'’m doing my coach speech.

35:59.853 --> 36:03.683
Do I look like the kind
of guy who'’s gonna go
for the "rah-rah" stuff?

36:04.858 --> 36:08.296
Fine.
Then let'’s talk strategy.

36:08.340 --> 36:10.080
You wanna feint
a Reverse STO.Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

36:10.124 --> 36:12.344
And then when we get him
behind you--You know what?

36:12.387 --> 36:14.302
I think I'’m just gonna go
with what I know.

36:14.346 --> 36:15.956
-For reals?
-Yeah, for realsies.

36:15.999 --> 36:18.741
No. I'’m your coach,
and we need a strategy.

36:18.785 --> 36:21.657
Trust me. I got this.
Watch and learn.

36:21.701 --> 36:25.313
You know the rules.
I want a good,
clean wrestling match.

36:25.357 --> 36:28.186
So if you'’re gonna do
something illegal,
don'’t let me see it.

36:28.229 --> 36:30.449
Go to your corners
and come out wrestling!

36:30.492 --> 36:33.060
Not too hard, right?

36:33.103 --> 36:36.368
Sorry. I just love
to laugh. That'’s me.I ain'’t laughing.

36:36.411 --> 36:38.674
But I will be
when I pin your face
in the dirt

36:38.718 --> 36:40.720
and break your jaw
with my horns!

36:41.851 --> 36:44.332
Boy, does that sound painful.
Can'’t wait.

36:44.376 --> 36:46.073
[bell rings][roars]

36:46.116 --> 36:49.772
[announcer]
And here come the wrestlers,
circling each other.

36:49.816 --> 36:53.559
Hey, why don'’t you circle down
to Georgie'’s Mattress Outlet?

36:54.864 --> 36:58.128
Oh, gosh, you really
got me on that!

36:58.172 --> 37:00.392
I think I'’m knocked out.

37:00.435 --> 37:03.525
I am going down. Timber.

that'’s kind of a waste?Seven! Eight!

I'’m already down here.Nine!

And that'’s round one.

That'’s the bell.

Remember, folks,
if Ramarilla gets
a knockout in the second...

37:39.605 --> 37:42.912
What was that? You are
embarrassing us out there!

37:42.956 --> 37:45.088
This isn'’t Pittsmore.
This is a real match.

37:45.132 --> 37:48.309
You can'’t just throw it.Yeah, I get that now, okay?

37:48.353 --> 37:52.270
So I just need to figure out
how not to die,
and then cha-ching.

37:52.313 --> 37:55.447
-That'’s the sound
of me making money.
-There'’s no money if you lose.

37:55.490 --> 37:57.536
Wait, what?
You said this was a paid match.

37:57.579 --> 37:59.451
It is. Winner takes all.

37:59.494 --> 38:01.757
You didn'’t read the paperwork
I had you sign?

38:01.801 --> 38:03.368
Nobody reads the paperwork!

38:03.411 --> 38:05.326
So, if you want
that money,

38:05.370 --> 38:08.198
we'’re gonna have to
try a very radical
new strategy here.

38:08.242 --> 38:10.505
Ready for it? Try to win.

38:10.549 --> 38:12.290
Okay, big shot. How?

38:12.333 --> 38:14.596
Okay.
Uh, so, he'’s strong.

38:14.640 --> 38:17.338
Yeah, I got that.He'’s really
freakishly strong.

38:17.382 --> 38:19.949
But you know what that means.
No stamina.

38:19.993 --> 38:22.038
So here'’s what
you'’re gonna do. Run away.Uh-huh.

38:22.082 --> 38:25.694
If he does catch you,
let him hit you.
Then start running again.

38:25.738 --> 38:27.392
That'’s your big plan?

38:27.435 --> 38:29.829
Yep, and then
when he'’s all punched out,
we make our move.

38:29.872 --> 38:32.135
So run away
and then let him hit me.

38:32.179 --> 38:35.443
And if you get knocked down,
you'’re gonna get back up.

38:35.487 --> 38:38.054
Staying down is much easier.

Just keep going in a circle

he runs out of steam?

And now for my favorite segment:
"Worst Match of the Week."

40:58.107 --> 41:01.241
Easy choice this week, Marc.
Take a look.

41:01.284 --> 41:04.374
Oh, man. It'’s really
an insult to the sport.

41:04.418 --> 41:07.116
And I don'’t just mean
this sport. I mean any sport!

41:07.160 --> 41:10.772
To competitiveness,
for crying out loud!
This is just awful!

41:10.816 --> 41:13.079
Okay, calm down there, Marc.

41:13.122 --> 41:16.299
And now we'’re gonna go
from the bottom of the league

And to everybody who wondered

41:24.307 --> 41:27.963
how Tentacular would handle
the big-city pressure,
the answer'’s simple.

41:28.007 --> 41:29.661
He'’s never wrestled better.

of that monster

42:06.393 --> 42:08.351
[chortles] How awesome.No.

42:08.395 --> 42:10.005
No, it'’s not awesome, Steve.

No one'’s ever gonna
fight us in Stoker.
We'’re a joke.

And just for
the tiniest moment there,
I was feeling okay about myself.

42:15.620 --> 42:19.188
Yeah, well, that'’s over now.
Look, you still need
a pile of cash,

42:19.232 --> 42:24.193
and I need to stop Jimothy
from turning this
into a parking lot.

[screams]

49:00.981 --> 49:05.290
Come on, push it, Steve.
Pain is weakness
leaving the body.

49:07.640 --> 49:09.468
I'’m awake! Whoa!

49:14.342 --> 49:15.387
Yes.

49:25.136 --> 49:28.748
-Yes!
-Steve! Whoo-hoo! Up top.

49:28.791 --> 49:30.315
Now you'’re dancing.

49:44.068 --> 49:48.550
Okay, so, there'’s no spots
left in the Saturday
Super Smashdown.

49:48.594 --> 49:53.033
But some lizard dude
in the Eastern League is
shedding his skin right now.

49:53.077 --> 49:54.861
Ew! Gross!

49:54.904 --> 49:56.428
Ugh! I know.

49:56.471 --> 49:59.344
So, they'’ll take us
as a replacement!

50:00.736 --> 50:03.609
The only catch is,
this guy you'’re gonna wrestle,

50:03.652 --> 50:06.090
he is really big.

50:07.134 --> 50:08.657
Like, I mean, huge!

50:08.701 --> 50:12.531
Think of the biggest thing
you'’ve ever seen. Enormous!

50:15.055 --> 50:16.709
Oh, come on.

50:17.971 --> 50:21.018
-It'’s in my mouth!
-Ugh!

50:21.061 --> 50:24.543
The only way
we'’re gonna beat him is
by getting him on his back.

50:24.586 --> 50:27.546
-So how do we do that?
-[Winnie] Wait for it.

50:27.589 --> 50:30.244
-[cries out]
-We'’re gonna need some help.

50:30.288 --> 50:34.683
Long time no see, Steve.

50:34.727 --> 50:37.512
What? [gasps, groans]

50:37.556 --> 50:38.644
Okay, get ready.

50:38.687 --> 50:41.560
Nobody puts Ray-Ray
in a corner.

50:41.603 --> 50:43.127
[chortling]

50:44.084 --> 50:45.346
[Winnie] Now, lift!

50:45.390 --> 50:47.174
Come on.Lift me!

50:47.218 --> 50:49.742
[Winnie]
Do it again! Again!

50:51.004 --> 50:52.571
That'’s it. You got it.

50:53.876 --> 50:55.443
Whee!

50:55.487 --> 50:57.576
[Winnie]
And now, do the lift!

51:04.757 --> 51:06.324
[grunting]

51:07.238 --> 51:09.414
[screaming]

51:09.457 --> 51:11.024
[sighs]

51:11.068 --> 51:13.113
[groans][bell rings]

51:13.157 --> 51:14.854
You did it! You won!

51:14.897 --> 51:17.987
Oh, come on, Mac.
This ain'’t monster wrestling.

51:18.031 --> 51:20.381
It'’s an affront to the sport,
and you know it.

51:20.425 --> 51:22.209
We all should be shocked
and appalled.

51:22.253 --> 51:25.517
But somehow they'’ve won
three in a row.

51:25.560 --> 51:29.129
And the way he combines
traditional Cuban salsa

51:29.173 --> 51:30.870
with a hint of modern swing

51:30.913 --> 51:33.873
and then finishes
with a lovely technical lift,

51:33.916 --> 51:37.442
that is a high degree
of difficulty right there.

51:37.485 --> 51:40.532
Your knowledge of dance moves
is mystifying to me.

51:40.575 --> 51:44.362
Still waters run deep, Marc.
Still waters run deep.

51:44.405 --> 51:47.582
Right, Mac. Joining us now
from their latest match

51:47.626 --> 51:50.237
is Winnie Coyle
and Steve the Stupendous.

51:50.281 --> 51:52.152
-[cheering]
-Well, guys,

51:52.196 --> 51:54.067
congratulations
on your latest win.

51:54.111 --> 51:55.808
But, please,
somebody admit it.

51:55.851 --> 51:58.637
This is hardly wrestling.
Y'’all know that, right?

52:01.727 --> 52:03.903
Uh, Coach Winnie,
we'’re live.

52:03.946 --> 52:06.645
Live? We'’re-- We're live.
Right. Right. We'’re live.

52:06.688 --> 52:08.908
[chuckles] You know--
You know what?

52:08.951 --> 52:12.085
It is a little hot in here.
I could use a fan.

52:12.129 --> 52:14.479
Speaking of,
I am a fan to you, Marc.

52:14.522 --> 52:18.570
Big fan. Uh, you know,
but just what you said before--

52:18.613 --> 52:22.617
If it is hardly wrestling,
then how come we just
keep winning?

52:22.661 --> 52:25.794
Ho, ho!
She got you there, Marc.Whatever.

52:25.838 --> 52:28.754
You won a couple
against some very, very
questionable opponents.

52:28.797 --> 52:32.323
I'’ll give you that much.
But what'’s next
for Steve the Stupendous?

52:32.366 --> 52:34.629
You know, I was hoping
you would ask that.

52:34.673 --> 52:36.501
We are ready
for our next match.

52:36.544 --> 52:40.244
And you know where we want it?
Back in Stoker!

52:40.287 --> 52:41.984
Stoker!Stoker!

52:42.028 --> 52:43.551
You tell '’em, Winnie!

52:43.595 --> 52:46.641
That'’s right! We'll wrestle
any monster anytime!

52:46.685 --> 52:50.079
So, monsters, coaches,
you think you want a crack

52:50.123 --> 52:54.171
at the undefeated, unbeatable
Steve the Stupendous,

52:54.214 --> 52:55.694
you give me a call.

52:55.737 --> 52:58.479
You think you'’re ready
for a big match in Stoker?

52:58.523 --> 53:01.178
Jimothy.
Hey, you watching this?

53:02.570 --> 53:04.703
Look at me. I'’m shaking.

53:04.746 --> 53:07.009
Oh, my gosh.
I'’m still shaking so much.

53:07.053 --> 53:10.926
Look at my hands!
Was I too much back there?
I was too much, right?

53:10.970 --> 53:13.233
Yeah, well,
when it comes to wrestling,

53:13.277 --> 53:15.279
"too much" isn'’t really a thing.

53:15.322 --> 53:18.717
-Oh, right.
-Okay. What do we do now, Coach?

53:18.760 --> 53:20.327
Now? We wait.

53:20.371 --> 53:22.460
[ringtone: monster roaring][gasps]

53:22.503 --> 53:26.246
Hello. This is
Coach Winnie Coyle.
Uh-- Oh.

53:26.290 --> 53:28.074
It'’s King Gorge's coach.
It worked!

53:28.117 --> 53:31.860
Really? He wants to wrestle
Steve the Stupendous?

53:31.904 --> 53:34.776
In Stoker?
He'’ll gladly accept.

53:34.820 --> 53:37.866
[exclaims]
We got a match in Stoker!

53:37.910 --> 53:42.044
All right. Okay, King,
I'’ve got you a match
you can'’t lose.

53:42.088 --> 53:44.090
[whining]

53:44.133 --> 53:45.700
Oh, come on, King!

53:45.744 --> 53:49.095
It'’ll get
your confidence back up.
Make you feel good.

53:49.138 --> 53:50.792
[whimpering]

53:52.881 --> 53:55.362
New sign is looking good,
Fred.

53:55.406 --> 53:57.930
Thanks, Winnie.
I made it myself.

53:57.973 --> 54:01.368
Took me seven sheets
to spell "stupendous" correctly!

54:01.412 --> 54:04.197
S-T-O-K-E-R!

54:04.241 --> 54:05.285
Stoker!

54:05.329 --> 54:07.548
[Winnie] S-T-E-V-E!

54:07.592 --> 54:11.683
-[Steve] Steve!
-[both] Stoker! Steve!

54:14.947 --> 54:16.035
What'’s going on?

54:16.078 --> 54:17.515
I'’m sorry, Winnie.

54:17.558 --> 54:20.082
I know all of this
really old,

54:20.126 --> 54:23.521
completely useless stuff
means a lot to you,

54:23.564 --> 54:24.957
but we gotta
clear it out.

54:25.000 --> 54:27.699
They need to rig this place
to blow...

54:27.742 --> 54:29.918
-What?
-...up and explode.

54:29.962 --> 54:33.008
No, no, no. They can'’t
do that! We don'’t need
to sell to Jimothy.

54:33.052 --> 54:36.360
That'’s mine.We just got a match
right here in Stoker.

54:36.403 --> 54:40.581
Listen, Jimothy sweetened
the deal if we moved up
the signing date.

54:40.625 --> 54:43.932
So, it'’s a lot of money.Uh, what? [sighs]

54:43.976 --> 54:46.283
Please, there must be
something you can do.

54:46.326 --> 54:48.110
I'’m sorry.
You'’re too late.

54:48.154 --> 54:52.419
The mayor is signing the deal
at Slitherpoole Stadium
this afternoon.

54:52.463 --> 54:53.768
Drink Tentaculade,

54:53.812 --> 54:56.684
the official drink
of the greatest time of--

54:56.728 --> 54:58.120
Uh, line?

54:58.164 --> 55:02.124
Tentaculade,
the official drink
of the great-- Um, no.

55:02.168 --> 55:05.432
The official great--
Drink greatness! This time--

55:05.476 --> 55:08.000
Oh! This tastes disgusting.

55:08.043 --> 55:11.090
I can'’t believe
this is my drink.
Who approved this?

55:11.133 --> 55:12.700
That was you, T.Oh, me? Oh.

55:12.744 --> 55:14.702
Okay, let'’s take five,
everyone.

55:14.746 --> 55:16.791
[bell ringing][cameraman] All right,
everyone. Let'’s reset.

55:16.835 --> 55:20.142
Mr. Jimothy? Uh, the mayor
of Stoker is here for you.

55:20.186 --> 55:22.319
I'’d really just like
to thank you, Mr. Jimothy.

55:22.362 --> 55:25.496
You'’ve really saved our bacon.
Gosh, I'’m hungry.

55:25.539 --> 55:27.672
Oh, me too.
Intermittent fast day.

55:27.715 --> 55:30.805
I'’ve been doing it for
a week now, and my blood sugar
is going banana--

55:30.849 --> 55:33.721
I'’m having a cookie.
Can someone grab me
a cookie real quick?

55:33.765 --> 55:38.465
Stop! We don'’t need to do this.
Mr. Mayor, don'’t sign.

55:38.509 --> 55:40.728
I already did.I love this part.

55:40.772 --> 55:43.078
I'’m nervous.
I was practicing
my signature yesterday.

55:43.122 --> 55:45.429
I realize that
I just scribble,
but watch.

55:45.472 --> 55:46.821
Just hold on!What?

55:46.865 --> 55:48.954
Mr. Jimothy, Stoker has
a new champion wrestler

55:48.997 --> 55:51.173
that everyone in Stoker
is gonna come see.

55:51.217 --> 55:52.610
So we don'’t need your money.

55:52.653 --> 55:54.481
Is that true, Winnie?Yes.

55:54.525 --> 55:58.572
Steve over here
just got a big-time match
in Stoker against King Gorge.

55:58.616 --> 56:00.008
That'’s right.

56:00.052 --> 56:01.401
[laughing]

56:01.445 --> 56:03.838
King Gorge? Oh, man.

56:03.882 --> 56:07.102
He hasn'’t come out
of his kennel
since I destroyed him.

56:08.060 --> 56:09.278
He'’s broken.

56:09.322 --> 56:10.976
Everybody in the game
knows that.

56:11.019 --> 56:14.980
This is so embarrassing for you.
You haven'’t seen this?

56:15.023 --> 56:17.678
[Tentacular]
Old Gorge is never
gonna wrestle again.

56:17.722 --> 56:19.985
And even if he did,

56:20.028 --> 56:22.422
it ain'’t gonna be
in Stoker Stadium.

56:22.466 --> 56:24.163
Sign the papers,
Jimothy.

56:24.206 --> 56:26.383
I don'’t understand.

56:26.426 --> 56:28.385
Oh, you still don'’t get it,
do you?

56:28.428 --> 56:30.212
It was never
about the money.

56:30.256 --> 56:33.868
Stoker Stadium
is coming down
because I want it to.

56:33.912 --> 56:35.609
But why?

56:35.653 --> 56:39.874
Because no matter how many
championships I win,

56:39.918 --> 56:45.706
some chump'’s always
gonna be telling me that
I'’m not as good as Rayburn.

56:45.750 --> 56:49.580
So I figure I can live
in his shadow,

56:49.623 --> 56:53.061
or I can tear down
everything

56:53.105 --> 56:55.107
that casts that shadow.

56:55.150 --> 56:56.630
Boom!

56:56.674 --> 56:59.981
Wow. And I thought I had issues.
That'’s just crazy.

57:00.025 --> 57:03.028
Who asked you?
You make me sick.

57:03.071 --> 57:05.291
Dancin'’ ain't wrestlin'’.

57:05.334 --> 57:07.249
You'’re pathetic.

57:07.293 --> 57:09.513
-Hey, hey, put him down!
-Okay.

57:09.556 --> 57:11.558
[grunts, groans]

57:11.602 --> 57:14.996
Oh! This is gonna go
so viral!

57:18.783 --> 57:21.176
Please don'’t do this.

57:22.003 --> 57:24.658
That stadium is
everything to that town.

57:25.311 --> 57:26.617
To me.

57:27.313 --> 57:29.489
Please don'’t take that away.

57:29.533 --> 57:32.274
Winnie,
this isn'’t about you.

57:32.318 --> 57:34.102
It'’s all about me.

57:34.146 --> 57:35.669
Sign the papers, Jimothy.

57:39.847 --> 57:42.633
[seethes]
You'’re okay with this?

57:42.676 --> 57:45.287
With him destroying
everything you and Dad built?

57:45.331 --> 57:48.508
Winnie,
let me tell you something.
I loved your dad.

57:48.552 --> 57:50.467
And he did great things
with Rayburn.

57:50.510 --> 57:53.818
But now it'’s my chance
to do great things
with Tentacular.

57:53.861 --> 57:55.297
That'’s just wrestling.

57:55.341 --> 57:56.777
[groaning]

57:58.257 --> 58:01.826
What you'’re doing
with this dancing,

58:01.869 --> 58:04.872
I'’m just glad
Jimbo ain'’t around
to see it.

58:32.552 --> 58:33.988
[sighs]

58:34.032 --> 58:35.555
[sighs]

58:36.600 --> 58:38.602
[groans]

58:39.690 --> 58:42.649
You have enough money
to pay Lady Mayhen now.

58:42.693 --> 58:46.131
You don'’t need me.
Just leave me alone.

58:46.174 --> 58:47.524
Even if I wanted to...

58:47.567 --> 58:48.742
[grunts]

58:48.786 --> 58:51.049
...I'’m pretty sure
I live here now.

58:52.050 --> 58:55.053
[sighs] I thought I was
saving my dad'’s legacy.

58:55.880 --> 58:58.709
And instead, I ruined it.

58:58.752 --> 59:01.929
I'’ve made
the Coyle name a joke.

59:01.973 --> 59:03.365
Well, the good news is,

59:03.409 --> 59:06.325
you can always
change your name
and run away.

59:06.368 --> 59:08.196
That worked for you, Steve.

59:08.240 --> 59:12.853
But if I'’m not Winnie Coyle,
I'’m nothing.

59:14.246 --> 59:15.943
Come on, Winnie.

59:20.774 --> 59:24.561
What a sad end
to the legacy of Stoker.

59:24.604 --> 59:26.301
I told you, Mac! I told you!

59:26.345 --> 59:29.609
The whole thing was a joke
and a disgrace to the sport!

59:29.653 --> 59:32.046
To the Coyle name!
I'’ll tell you that too!

59:32.090 --> 59:34.571
And I for one
am glad it'’s over.

59:36.007 --> 59:38.444
Well, it was fun
while it lasted.

59:38.487 --> 59:39.967
And I still think

59:40.011 --> 59:42.927
Steve has a bright
dancing future ahead of him.

59:42.970 --> 59:45.364
Oh, please! Who cares
about dancing, anyway?

59:45.407 --> 59:48.236
Everyone cares about dancing!
Live a little, Marc!

59:48.280 --> 59:50.282
[thunder crashes]

59:56.288 --> 59:57.463
Look who'’s back.

59:57.506 --> 59:59.900
[sighs] It'’s all there.

59:59.944 --> 1:00:03.556
I should know,
'’cause I counted
every dollar bill,

1:00:03.600 --> 1:00:05.776
and they are--
they'’re tiny.

1:00:07.125 --> 1:00:09.649
Ah. Your old locker'’s
waiting, Steve.

1:00:12.304 --> 1:00:13.610
[sighs]

1:00:15.133 --> 1:00:18.397
[Lady Mayhen]
Welcome back, twinkle toes.
We missed you.

1:00:18.440 --> 1:00:21.443
It seems like you are
the hot new favorite

1:00:21.487 --> 1:00:23.358
after all of your adventures.

1:00:23.402 --> 1:00:25.186
Cha-cha-cha!

1:00:25.230 --> 1:00:27.841
We got a lot of money on you
to win tonight.

1:00:27.885 --> 1:00:33.760
And I'’m gonna keep all of it
when you lose.

1:00:33.804 --> 1:00:35.762
Yeah, I know the drill.

1:00:35.806 --> 1:00:39.810
You always were
my best loser.

1:00:42.551 --> 1:00:46.077
[door opens, closes]

1:01:02.354 --> 1:01:06.010
[people chattering][vehicles revving]

1:01:18.196 --> 1:01:19.371
[sighs]

1:01:23.854 --> 1:01:27.771
Hey. You did
everything you could.

1:01:27.814 --> 1:01:30.730
Then why do I feel like
I let everyone down?

1:01:30.774 --> 1:01:32.732
Oh, honey, you didn'’t.

1:01:32.776 --> 1:01:36.257
What you did out there,
coaching Ray-Ray,

1:01:36.301 --> 1:01:37.955
you were incredible.

1:01:37.998 --> 1:01:40.131
You should be so proud
of yourself.

1:01:40.174 --> 1:01:43.874
It'’s okay, Mom.
I don'’t care
about that anymore.

1:01:45.745 --> 1:01:48.748
Froyo. Froyo makes
everything better.

1:01:48.792 --> 1:01:50.576
What flavor do you want?

1:01:50.619 --> 1:01:52.404
Chocolate.You got it.

1:01:57.931 --> 1:01:59.716
[door closes]

1:01:59.759 --> 1:02:01.456
[sighs]

1:02:01.500 --> 1:02:03.371
[screams]

1:02:03.415 --> 1:02:05.722
Oh, my gosh.
What are you doing here?

1:02:05.765 --> 1:02:08.028
Ow! Right in the eye!

1:02:08.072 --> 1:02:10.204
I'’m sorry!No.

1:02:10.248 --> 1:02:13.120
That'’s all right.
I should'’ve called first.

1:02:13.164 --> 1:02:16.689
But, you know,
I don'’t have a phone.
Or pockets or...

1:02:16.733 --> 1:02:20.127
[chuckles] Look,
I need my coach back.

1:02:20.171 --> 1:02:22.564
[scoffs] Don'’t you get it?

1:02:22.608 --> 1:02:25.567
We'’re a total joke.
We don'’t belong in the ring.

1:02:25.611 --> 1:02:29.354
Hey, you know that feeling
that you'’re feeling
right now?

1:02:29.397 --> 1:02:31.008
That'’s how I felt
my whole life.

1:02:31.051 --> 1:02:33.750
I spent so much time
running away

1:02:33.793 --> 1:02:35.839
from what I thought
I should be

1:02:35.882 --> 1:02:38.798
or what people
expected me to be

1:02:38.842 --> 1:02:40.931
that I never found out
what I could be.

1:02:40.974 --> 1:02:44.238
And now-- now I have.

1:02:44.282 --> 1:02:48.329
And I know that
I'’m never gonna be the GOAT

1:02:48.373 --> 1:02:51.768
or win the Big Belt,
and that is just fine.

1:02:51.811 --> 1:02:54.988
But I am not going back
to being a loser.

1:02:55.684 --> 1:02:57.251
And that'’s on you.

1:02:57.295 --> 1:02:59.166
You ruined losing
for me.

1:02:59.210 --> 1:03:02.387
And you know what?
It feels good.

1:03:02.430 --> 1:03:06.260
I feel good for, like,
the first time.

1:03:06.304 --> 1:03:08.785
So, thank you.

1:03:08.828 --> 1:03:11.265
Rayburn, I...

1:03:14.486 --> 1:03:16.140
Thank you.Mmm.

1:03:17.010 --> 1:03:20.231
Okay, okay.
Enough with the sappy stuff.

1:03:20.274 --> 1:03:21.362
Ugh.

1:03:21.406 --> 1:03:24.278
I am here to help you
save that stadium.

1:03:24.322 --> 1:03:25.584
What?

1:03:26.890 --> 1:03:29.588
[Jimothy]
With this super-sweet
satellite parking lot,

1:03:29.631 --> 1:03:32.460
you'’ll be able to park
on quality asphalt.

1:03:32.504 --> 1:03:34.898
Stuff you guys haven'’t seen
in a while.

1:03:34.941 --> 1:03:38.162
And we'’ve put some beautiful
yellow lines right on there.

1:03:38.205 --> 1:03:40.468
And then you can take
the shuttle--

1:03:40.512 --> 1:03:43.776
Uh, is that a fin on top?
[laughs] I'’ll never tell--

1:03:43.820 --> 1:03:46.953
and see Tentacular wrestle
once again

1:03:46.997 --> 1:03:50.957
in classy and distant
Slitherpoole.

1:03:51.001 --> 1:03:53.133
-[jeering]
-[Fred] Hot dogs are on you!

1:03:53.177 --> 1:03:56.484
Hey, buddy. I'’m getting hurt.
If we can blow this up
and get out, that'’d be great.

1:03:56.528 --> 1:03:57.834
With pleasure!

1:03:57.877 --> 1:04:00.227
Five, four, three,
two, one. Go!

1:04:00.271 --> 1:04:02.403
[gasping]

1:04:05.015 --> 1:04:07.669
-Ha!
-[quizzical grunts]

1:04:08.888 --> 1:04:13.110
-Well, that was disappointing.
-[hip-hop music playing]

1:04:13.153 --> 1:04:16.983
What'’s the matter, boys?
You show up, but no blow up.

1:04:17.027 --> 1:04:19.986
-Oh, not these clowns again.
-That'’s right.

1:04:20.030 --> 1:04:21.770
What,
are you scared of clowns?

1:04:21.814 --> 1:04:25.513
I mean, obviously some
of them seem kinda creepy,
but, you know, us?

1:04:25.557 --> 1:04:29.735
Yeah! And we'’re here
to challenge you,
you big jabroni!

1:04:29.778 --> 1:04:31.258
Jabroni?You heard her.

1:04:31.302 --> 1:04:34.087
I'’m calling you out,
"Spentacular."

1:04:34.131 --> 1:04:38.352
I'’m gonna wrestle you
right here in Stoker.

1:04:38.396 --> 1:04:39.788
No. Yeah, right!

1:04:39.832 --> 1:04:44.924
Why would I wrestle
a nobody loser
like you, Steve?

1:04:44.968 --> 1:04:48.623
Oh. My name is not Steve.

1:04:48.667 --> 1:04:53.585
I'’m the son of the greatest
monster wrestler of all time.

1:04:53.628 --> 1:04:54.760
[all gasp]

1:04:54.803 --> 1:04:58.024
My name is Rayburn Jr.

1:04:58.068 --> 1:04:59.896
That'’s--It can'’t be.

1:04:59.939 --> 1:05:03.682
Oh, yeah!
Feel the burn--
the Rayburn!

1:05:03.725 --> 1:05:05.423
Yes!Rayburn!

1:05:07.207 --> 1:05:10.732
There is absolutely no way.
Are you kidding me?

1:05:10.776 --> 1:05:13.387
-Oh, I see it.
-[panting]

1:05:13.431 --> 1:05:14.693
Are you okay?

1:05:14.736 --> 1:05:17.391
Yeah. Felt pretty good
to get it off my chest.

1:05:17.435 --> 1:05:21.395
-You'’re Rayburn's kid?
-You bet he is.

1:05:21.439 --> 1:05:24.050
If you really wanna blow up
Rayburn'’s legacy,

1:05:24.094 --> 1:05:25.834
then fight his son.

1:05:25.878 --> 1:05:28.881
He'’s standing right
in front of you.[crowd chanting "Rayburn"]

1:05:28.925 --> 1:05:31.362
I would destroy you!

1:05:31.405 --> 1:05:33.364
Oh. Like you destroyed
King Gorge?

1:05:33.407 --> 1:05:36.497
Why don'’t you "tell" us
all about that one.

1:05:36.541 --> 1:05:38.195
What? Oh, no.

1:05:38.238 --> 1:05:41.285
What was it? The third round?
I bet we could beat that,
Rayburn.

1:05:41.328 --> 1:05:44.984
We said one, not three.
We were gonna go for one round.

1:05:45.028 --> 1:05:46.681
I got excited.
Just go with it.

1:05:46.725 --> 1:05:50.598
[clears throat]
Um, right, three.
That'’s right.

1:05:50.642 --> 1:05:53.601
What? You think
you could go three rounds
with Tentacular?

1:05:53.645 --> 1:05:56.561
[chortles]
I think we should make a bet.

1:05:56.604 --> 1:05:59.346
A bet?We'’ll go
three rounds with you.

1:05:59.390 --> 1:06:03.698
And if I survive,
Stoker keeps the stadium.

1:06:03.742 --> 1:06:08.660
I mean, unless
you'’re ch-ch-ch-chicken.

1:06:08.703 --> 1:06:11.010
[imitating chicken clucking][crowd laughing]

1:06:11.054 --> 1:06:14.927
Fine! It'’s on!
By the time
Tentacular'’s done,

1:06:14.971 --> 1:06:19.236
there'’s not gonna be
a thing left of you,
this town,

1:06:19.279 --> 1:06:21.281
or your overrated dads.

1:06:21.325 --> 1:06:24.023
Tentacular'’s
gonna bury it all.

1:06:25.372 --> 1:06:26.721
Let'’s see you try.

1:06:26.765 --> 1:06:30.203
Let'’s see you try
right here in Stoker.

1:06:30.247 --> 1:06:34.512
[crowd cheering,
chanting "Stoker"]

1:06:36.949 --> 1:06:38.995
[seethes]

1:06:47.220 --> 1:06:50.049
Incredible scenes in Stoker.
Rayburn Jr.

1:06:50.093 --> 1:06:52.182
That'’s right, son of
the legendary Rayburn...

1:06:52.225 --> 1:06:53.574
What did he just say?

1:06:53.618 --> 1:06:55.924
[speaking French]

1:06:55.968 --> 1:06:59.493
[speaking Japanese]

1:06:59.537 --> 1:07:03.628
-Holy--
-Guacamole and chips
for lunch today.

1:07:03.671 --> 1:07:05.369
[bird caws]

1:07:05.412 --> 1:07:08.850
And everyone is totally
super excited

1:07:08.894 --> 1:07:12.680
for what they are calling
the match of the century.

1:07:12.724 --> 1:07:14.987
And though Rayburn Jr...Whoa!

1:07:15.031 --> 1:07:17.859
Steve is Rayburn Jr.!

1:07:17.903 --> 1:07:21.080
Big boots to fill, Marc.
Well, if he'’d worn boots.

1:07:21.124 --> 1:07:25.041
But I'’m thinking about it now,
and I don'’t remember him
wearing boots. So scratch that.

1:07:25.084 --> 1:07:28.348
But for now it'’s goodbye
Steve the Stupendous,

1:07:28.392 --> 1:07:31.612
and hello, Rayburn Jr.!

1:07:31.656 --> 1:07:34.093
[groans, sobbing]

1:07:34.137 --> 1:07:35.747
[groans]

1:07:35.790 --> 1:07:38.097
[Winnie] Okay, the town
has come together and built

1:07:38.141 --> 1:07:42.145
this spectacular
anti-Tentacular agility
and evasion training device,

1:07:42.188 --> 1:07:46.236
otherwise known as
the Gauntlet of Doom!

1:07:46.279 --> 1:07:48.281
[Rayburn]
That'’s not a fun name.

1:07:48.325 --> 1:07:51.110
[Winnie] Nothing we'’ve done
comes close to going
three rounds with Tentacular.

1:07:51.154 --> 1:07:52.807
But we might just have a shot

1:07:52.851 --> 1:07:56.420
if you can survive the gauntlet
and reach my dad'’s statue.

1:08:01.555 --> 1:08:02.469
Uh-oh.

1:08:02.513 --> 1:08:04.384
All right, twinkle toes.

1:08:04.428 --> 1:08:07.039
Put on your red shoes.
Let'’s dance.

1:08:07.083 --> 1:08:08.823
["Tubthumping" playing]

1:08:08.867 --> 1:08:10.390
[shouts]

1:08:10.434 --> 1:08:12.262
Ooh![Winnie]
Let'’s do it again.

1:08:12.305 --> 1:08:14.568
[Rayburn exclaiming]

1:08:18.050 --> 1:08:19.617
[snoring]

1:08:19.660 --> 1:08:22.359
[Winnie]
The most important thing
you gotta do

1:08:22.402 --> 1:08:24.230
is neutralize Tentacular'’s
biggest threat.

1:08:24.274 --> 1:08:26.102
His right hook.No, it'’s in his name.

1:08:26.145 --> 1:08:28.800
[Rayburn] Oh, his tentacles.
I was gonna say his tentacles.

1:08:31.933 --> 1:08:34.240
We'’re gonna use every trick
you learned in the underground,

1:08:34.284 --> 1:08:39.158
every step you learned
on your global dance journey
that you do not talk about.

1:08:39.202 --> 1:08:40.594
Oh, come on!

1:08:40.638 --> 1:08:43.249
[Winnie]
Every fake-out and foxtrot.

1:08:47.297 --> 1:08:48.646
Singin'’ in the Rain.

1:08:48.689 --> 1:08:50.169
The Worm.

1:08:50.213 --> 1:08:51.692
Pop and lock.

1:08:51.736 --> 1:08:54.347
They say offense
is the best defense?

1:08:54.391 --> 1:08:57.133
No! Defense
is the best defense!

1:08:57.176 --> 1:09:00.875
It doesn'’t have to look pretty.
It just has to get us through
the third.

1:09:00.919 --> 1:09:03.139
Come on. That was pretty.

1:09:03.182 --> 1:09:04.618
To survival!

1:09:04.662 --> 1:09:06.664
[cheering]

1:09:11.669 --> 1:09:14.498
Ah-ah! You'’re not done yet.

1:09:24.334 --> 1:09:26.901
[gasping]

1:09:26.945 --> 1:09:29.165
[grunting]

1:09:29.208 --> 1:09:30.992
[panting]

1:09:31.036 --> 1:09:33.952
[grunting]

1:09:42.961 --> 1:09:45.050
Am I ready now?

1:09:45.093 --> 1:09:48.271
Mm-hmm.
You'’re ready, Rayburn.

1:09:51.970 --> 1:09:55.234
Oh, yeah! I'’m stoked
to be back in Stoker.

1:09:55.278 --> 1:09:58.455
[laughs] We all are!
Whoo!

1:09:58.498 --> 1:10:01.284
Tonight is going to
go down in history

1:10:01.327 --> 1:10:02.981
as the greatest match ever

1:10:03.024 --> 1:10:05.113
or the shortest,
most painful embarrassment

1:10:05.157 --> 1:10:07.290
to ever happen
in professional
monster wrestling.

1:10:07.333 --> 1:10:09.857
I'’m praying it's a great match,
'’cause I got something
to tell you.

1:10:09.901 --> 1:10:12.730
I am not interested
in going home tonight.

1:10:14.558 --> 1:10:16.255
It sounds like
there'’s a story there,

1:10:16.299 --> 1:10:18.039
but I'’m gonna have to
cut you off, Marc,

1:10:18.083 --> 1:10:21.391
because I am just hearing
we'’re moments away

1:10:21.434 --> 1:10:24.481
from the competitors
entering the ring.

1:10:25.395 --> 1:10:27.527
[exhales sharply]You ready, champ?

1:10:27.571 --> 1:10:29.268
It'’s show time.

1:10:34.273 --> 1:10:35.753
[joints crack]

1:10:45.371 --> 1:10:46.677
[groans]

1:10:46.720 --> 1:10:49.201
Well, that ruined
my cool entrance.

1:10:49.245 --> 1:10:50.855
[ring announcer]
Ladies and gentlemen,

1:10:50.898 --> 1:10:55.163
World Monster Wrestling
presents a special event.

1:10:55.207 --> 1:10:58.732
One stadium.
One last chance.

1:10:58.776 --> 1:11:00.299
Two monsters.

1:11:00.343 --> 1:11:04.434
The Smackdown
to Save the Stadium!

1:11:05.783 --> 1:11:08.002
Let him win!In this corner,

1:11:08.046 --> 1:11:10.527
weighing in at 22 tons,

1:11:10.570 --> 1:11:14.705
standing 43 feet tall,
from Stoker,

1:11:14.748 --> 1:11:18.186
Rayburn Jr.!

1:11:18.230 --> 1:11:20.319
[salsa music playing]

1:11:20.363 --> 1:11:22.669
[crowd cheering]

1:11:22.713 --> 1:11:23.844
Oh, yeah.

1:11:25.716 --> 1:11:27.761
-Rayburn Jr.!
-[Fred] You got this, Winnie!

1:11:27.805 --> 1:11:29.763
[laughing]
Hey, everybody.

1:11:29.807 --> 1:11:32.549
I know her!
She eats in my diner!

1:11:32.592 --> 1:11:34.681
[Mac] Look at
the confidence, Marc.

1:11:34.725 --> 1:11:36.857
[Marc] Somebody'’s gotta
say this about Rayburn Jr.

1:11:36.901 --> 1:11:41.035
We know he'’s audacious,
he'’s courageous, but three
rounds with Tentacular?

1:11:41.079 --> 1:11:43.560
What is he thinking?
He might be losing
his monster mind.

1:11:43.603 --> 1:11:47.477
-I just don'’t know.
-[Mac] There is so much
riding on him tonight.

1:11:47.520 --> 1:11:50.306
Let'’s not forget to mention
that in his corner

1:11:50.349 --> 1:11:53.265
is the young rookie coach
Winnie Coyle.

1:11:53.309 --> 1:11:58.052
That'’s right: daughter
of the legendary coach
Jimbo Coyle.

1:11:58.096 --> 1:12:00.968
Winnie, no matter
what happens tonight,

1:12:01.012 --> 1:12:03.884
your father would be
so proud of you.

1:12:03.928 --> 1:12:05.364
Thanks, Mom.

1:12:06.713 --> 1:12:09.934
[ring announcer] And now,
in his return to Stoker,

1:12:09.977 --> 1:12:13.938
the undefeated reigning
holder of the Big Belt:

1:12:13.981 --> 1:12:16.941
Tentacular!

1:12:16.984 --> 1:12:20.423
[crowd jeering]What'’s going on, Stoker?

1:12:20.466 --> 1:12:22.207
Oh, you miss this?

1:12:22.250 --> 1:12:23.774
Forget about it!

1:12:23.817 --> 1:12:26.516
'’Cause you ain't ever seeing
one of these again.

1:12:33.044 --> 1:12:35.263
[Winnie] Ray, you okay?

1:12:35.307 --> 1:12:37.483
Rayburn!
Are you with me?

1:12:37.527 --> 1:12:39.398
[gasps]

1:12:39.442 --> 1:12:42.532
I am literally terrified.

1:12:42.575 --> 1:12:46.274
I don'’t think I can do this.
I can'’t be him.

1:12:46.318 --> 1:12:48.538
[Winnie] No, you can'’t.

1:12:49.365 --> 1:12:51.584
But we don'’t have to
be our dads.

1:12:51.628 --> 1:12:55.066
We just have to be ourselves.
You showed me that.

1:12:55.109 --> 1:12:59.375
They wrote their stories,
and we'’re writing ours
right now.

1:12:59.418 --> 1:13:03.161
And, yeah, maybe theirs was all
dramatic and super serious,

1:13:03.204 --> 1:13:07.252
and maybe ours is more like
a slapstick comedy.

1:13:07.295 --> 1:13:08.471
Oh, I love those.

1:13:08.514 --> 1:13:10.995
Me too.
Especially ones about friends.

1:13:12.475 --> 1:13:15.695
So, are you ready
to go out there
and look ridiculous tonight?

1:13:15.739 --> 1:13:17.610
Yes.How ridiculous?

1:13:17.654 --> 1:13:19.656
Very, very ridiculous!

1:13:19.699 --> 1:13:21.614
-And do we care?
-We don'’t care.

1:13:21.658 --> 1:13:23.268
Uh, I can'’t hear you.

1:13:23.311 --> 1:13:25.052
We do not care!

1:13:25.096 --> 1:13:27.925
Now, buck up,
put your game face on,

1:13:27.968 --> 1:13:31.363
because it'’s time
to wrestle.

1:13:31.407 --> 1:13:33.409
And dance. Both!

1:13:35.149 --> 1:13:38.196
Whoa. Time out.
Was that a coach speech?

1:13:38.239 --> 1:13:40.633
Man,
I feel so inspired!

1:13:40.677 --> 1:13:42.113
You do?Yeah.

1:13:42.156 --> 1:13:43.941
You should'’ve done that
before every match.

1:13:43.984 --> 1:13:46.900
All right, wrestlers,
to the center of the ring.

1:13:46.944 --> 1:13:49.076
Okay, let'’s go make it
through the third.

1:13:49.120 --> 1:13:51.427
And if you live,
let'’s get froyo afterwards.

1:13:51.470 --> 1:13:54.560
Oh, I love froyo.
Wait, if I live?

1:13:54.604 --> 1:13:56.867
Okay, champ,
let'’s get this over quick.

1:13:56.910 --> 1:13:59.870
I got a hot date
at the Kaiju Lodge with Edna.
[chortles]

1:13:59.913 --> 1:14:01.611
[growls]

1:14:01.654 --> 1:14:04.309
I want a good, clean match,

1:14:04.352 --> 1:14:06.267
and obey my rules
at all times.

1:14:06.311 --> 1:14:09.532
Okay, touch appendages
and come out wrestling.

1:14:10.968 --> 1:14:12.796
Ow! Ow!

1:14:20.456 --> 1:14:22.545
Let'’s dan--

1:14:22.588 --> 1:14:24.068
-[gasps]
-[all gasp]

1:14:24.111 --> 1:14:26.592
[sighs]
Guess I'’m going home.

1:14:26.636 --> 1:14:27.941
Looks that way, Marc.

1:14:27.985 --> 1:14:29.943
Yeah!What? I'’m texting.

1:14:29.987 --> 1:14:31.771
Oh, did we win?
Should I celebrate?

1:14:31.815 --> 1:14:34.208
No, wait. I'’m up.

1:14:34.252 --> 1:14:37.951
That was a good shot.
Kind of lucky,
but I'’m all right.

1:14:38.822 --> 1:14:40.084
What?

1:14:40.867 --> 1:14:42.826
What are you waiting for?
Go get him.

1:14:43.566 --> 1:14:45.524
[Marc] Oh, come on.
Really? Really?

1:14:45.568 --> 1:14:47.091
Rayburn isn'’t even
trying to wrestle.

1:14:47.134 --> 1:14:49.180
He thinks he'’s gonna dance
his way through this.

1:14:49.223 --> 1:14:53.184
It would appear that way, Marc.
And I gotta say it'’s working.

1:14:53.227 --> 1:14:56.013
Watch his hands,
not his shimmering
salsa feet!

1:14:56.056 --> 1:15:00.844
-Yes! That'’s it!
-[Marc] Really?
We came out here for this?

1:15:00.887 --> 1:15:03.629
[Mac] Look at that!
Tentacular can'’t get near him!

1:15:03.673 --> 1:15:05.631
Look out!

1:15:05.675 --> 1:15:07.503
[Mac] Missed again.

1:15:10.157 --> 1:15:11.855
[Marc] Here we go!
Oh, there it is!

1:15:11.898 --> 1:15:14.205
Watch the tentacles!What?

1:15:14.248 --> 1:15:15.511
[Mac] Oh, and he gets away.

1:15:15.554 --> 1:15:17.382
-Oh! Right into the post!
-Yes!

1:15:17.425 --> 1:15:19.515
[Marc] I can'’t believe
what I'’m seeing.

1:15:19.558 --> 1:15:22.779
Rayburn hasn'’t landed
a single blow, and he'’s
still in the match.

1:15:22.822 --> 1:15:24.258
[Rayburn]
Take that, traitor!

1:15:25.259 --> 1:15:29.394
[Fred] Tonight'’s special:
fried calamari!

1:15:29.437 --> 1:15:32.832
[Marc]
Tentacular is seething mad,
and I don'’t blame him one bit.

1:15:32.876 --> 1:15:34.921
I mean, can we have
our money back?

1:15:34.965 --> 1:15:38.534
Yeah, I really hate to sit here
and say that you'’re right
about anything, Marc,

1:15:38.577 --> 1:15:42.276
but I'’m not even sure
we can call this a monster
wrestling match right now.

1:15:42.320 --> 1:15:45.932
We'’re doing this.
We'’re actually doing this.

1:15:45.976 --> 1:15:48.631
Hey, stay focused.
We'’re not ordering
froyo yet.

1:15:48.674 --> 1:15:51.416
Okay, champ,
he thinks he'’s got us
with his sweet moves,

1:15:51.459 --> 1:15:54.550
but he don'’t know
we got a few moves of our own.

1:15:54.593 --> 1:15:56.552
Why don'’t we ask him
to dance?

1:15:56.595 --> 1:15:58.249
Don'’t mind if I do.

1:15:58.728 --> 1:16:00.077
[crowd cheers]

1:16:02.253 --> 1:16:05.430
Come on, Rayburn!
Dance around him, not with him!

1:16:05.473 --> 1:16:07.998
[Mac] Looks like Siggy'’s
done his homework.

1:16:08.041 --> 1:16:10.348
Is that a Paso Doble
step routine?

1:16:10.391 --> 1:16:12.916
[Marc]
They'’re both dancing now.
Good grief.

1:16:12.959 --> 1:16:15.048
I can'’t take this.
I can'’t take this.

1:16:15.092 --> 1:16:18.399
[Marc] Look at Tentacular go!

1:16:18.443 --> 1:16:20.053
Attaboy!

1:16:20.097 --> 1:16:22.795
-[shouts]
-[Marc] What a sweet move.

1:16:22.839 --> 1:16:24.797
-I'’m not watching.
-[Marc] There it is!

1:16:24.841 --> 1:16:28.322
Don'’t let him corner you!
Get out there![Marc] This match is over.

1:16:28.366 --> 1:16:30.237
[Mac] Not yet.

1:16:30.281 --> 1:16:32.892
I don'’t know what
we'’re watching at this point,
but you know what?

1:16:32.936 --> 1:16:35.460
I like it. I like it a lot.

1:16:35.503 --> 1:16:38.942
Maybe more than
monster wrestling.[Marc] Oh, come on!

1:16:40.117 --> 1:16:41.553
[Mac] Oh, man.

1:16:41.597 --> 1:16:46.776
Tentacular is all over him
like a bad rash right now.

1:16:49.300 --> 1:16:52.433
Ah, this is too easy.

1:16:52.477 --> 1:16:54.827
You like that, Stoker? Bam!

1:16:58.483 --> 1:17:00.572
Suplex!

1:17:00.616 --> 1:17:02.530
[Mac]
Oh, this is a massacre.

1:17:02.574 --> 1:17:05.664
The ref'’s gonna have to
step in and stop this.

1:17:05.708 --> 1:17:06.926
[Winnie] Rayburn, heads up!

1:17:06.970 --> 1:17:08.449
-[Marc] Oh!
-Oh, no!

1:17:08.493 --> 1:17:11.191
[Marc] It'’s a wrap, y'all.
This match is over.

1:17:11.235 --> 1:17:13.454
[grunting]

1:17:13.498 --> 1:17:14.978
[jeering]

1:17:19.112 --> 1:17:21.506
[Tentacular]
You'’re an embarrassment
to your dad'’s name!

1:17:22.594 --> 1:17:25.423
You come out
this next round,
I'’m gonna end you,

1:17:25.466 --> 1:17:29.557
then bury what'’s left
under the ruins
of the stadium.

1:17:29.601 --> 1:17:33.126
All right, that'’s the bell!
Break it up, break it up!

1:17:34.519 --> 1:17:35.781
[sighs]

1:17:35.825 --> 1:17:37.478
Tentacular didn'’t want
that round to end.

1:17:37.522 --> 1:17:39.350
I can'’t see this lasting
much longer, Mac.

1:17:39.393 --> 1:17:42.440
[Mac] All he has to do
is hold on for this

1:17:42.483 --> 1:17:45.008
one last round,
and he saves the stadium.

1:17:45.051 --> 1:17:46.749
[Marc] Not happening, Mac.

1:17:46.792 --> 1:17:50.796
Tentacular'’s about
to destroy Rayburn Jr.
You can book that.

1:17:50.840 --> 1:17:53.581
Winnie, listen to me.
This ain'’t good.

1:17:53.625 --> 1:17:56.497
There'’s no stopping T
when he smells blood
in the water.

1:17:56.541 --> 1:17:59.413
I'’m begging you,
don'’t put Ray-Ray
back out there.

1:17:59.457 --> 1:18:03.417
You wanna be a real coach?
Think of your monster first.

1:18:03.461 --> 1:18:04.941
[gasps]

1:18:08.335 --> 1:18:10.729
[Rayburn panting]

1:18:10.773 --> 1:18:12.165
[Mac] It'’s over.

1:18:12.209 --> 1:18:15.038
Winnie Coyle
is throwing in the towel.

1:18:15.081 --> 1:18:16.866
Wait. What are you doing?

1:18:16.909 --> 1:18:19.303
It'’s just a building, Ray.

1:18:20.652 --> 1:18:22.436
Winnie. Ray-Ray.

1:18:22.480 --> 1:18:24.351
I want you to remember:

1:18:24.395 --> 1:18:27.441
This stadium
isn'’t your dads' legacy.

1:18:28.225 --> 1:18:29.269
You are.

1:18:34.797 --> 1:18:38.931
Who'’s chicken now, huh?
You'’re nothing, you hear me!

1:18:38.975 --> 1:18:41.542
You'’ll always be nothing!

1:18:41.586 --> 1:18:44.415
[crowd chanting "Rayburn Jr."]

1:18:45.503 --> 1:18:48.071
[spectator]
We love you, Rayburn Jr.!

1:18:49.899 --> 1:18:51.030
I wanna keep going.

1:18:51.074 --> 1:18:54.251
No. Ray, it'’s not worth it.

1:18:54.294 --> 1:18:55.774
Yes, it is.

1:18:55.818 --> 1:18:59.038
But we'’re gonna have to try
a radical new strategy.

1:18:59.082 --> 1:19:00.736
You ready for it?

1:19:00.779 --> 1:19:02.781
-Try to win.
-To win.

1:19:02.825 --> 1:19:04.391
We gotta take
the fight to him.

1:19:04.435 --> 1:19:06.872
He can'’t hit me
if I'’m hitting him, right?

1:19:06.916 --> 1:19:08.569
Right.It'’s just one round.

1:19:08.613 --> 1:19:11.921
We can do this,
but you'’ve gotta do
something for me.

1:19:11.964 --> 1:19:14.880
Anything.You gotta coach me up.

1:19:14.924 --> 1:19:16.969
Are you coming back out?

1:19:18.449 --> 1:19:21.278
Hey, Siggy.
We'’re not quite done.

1:19:21.321 --> 1:19:22.583
Oh, yeah.

1:19:22.627 --> 1:19:24.455
[crowd cheering]Hmm?

1:19:29.286 --> 1:19:32.419
Wait a second.
It looks like Rayburn'’s
gonna fight on.

1:19:32.463 --> 1:19:35.074
I am not sure
that'’s a good idea.

1:19:35.118 --> 1:19:38.121
Are you serious right now?
I cannot believe this.

1:19:38.164 --> 1:19:41.559
Tell me when
it'’s over, Marc.
I can'’t watch.

1:19:41.602 --> 1:19:43.169
Do it for Stoker!

1:19:43.213 --> 1:19:46.085
Then combine the Renegade
with the Roundhouse Tail Whip,

1:19:46.129 --> 1:19:48.000
and if he anticipates
and gets a hold of you,

1:19:48.044 --> 1:19:51.177
hit him as hard as you can
right in the tentacles.

1:19:51.221 --> 1:19:55.268
Just to be clear,
you are saying "tentacles,"
right?

1:19:55.312 --> 1:19:57.444
Yeah. Tentacles. Okay.[relieved sigh]

1:19:57.488 --> 1:20:00.447
Everything you need to win
is in here,

1:20:00.491 --> 1:20:02.536
in here and in here.

1:20:02.580 --> 1:20:04.495
[chuckles]You got this.

1:20:04.538 --> 1:20:07.367
You should'’ve stayed down,
chump!

1:20:07.411 --> 1:20:09.630
You don'’t know
what you'’ve got
yourself into!

1:20:09.674 --> 1:20:12.198
-[shouting]
-[shouting]

1:20:15.985 --> 1:20:17.638
Yes!What is this?

1:20:17.682 --> 1:20:20.554
Rayburn knocked
the champ down!
I can'’t believe it!

1:20:20.598 --> 1:20:22.208
[chuckles] It'’s on.

1:20:22.252 --> 1:20:25.124
[Marc] It'’s almost like
we finally got
a wrestling match.

1:20:25.168 --> 1:20:27.866
[spectator]
Come on, Rayburn!

1:20:27.910 --> 1:20:31.391
[Marc] Now they'’re actually
going toe-to-toe,
like it'’s supposed to be.

1:20:31.435 --> 1:20:33.654
Come on, huh?
What are we waiting for?

1:20:33.698 --> 1:20:36.832
He shouldn'’t even be
in the same ring with you.
Throw this bum out.

1:20:36.875 --> 1:20:38.877
No, no, no!
Don'’t let him in so close!

1:20:38.921 --> 1:20:40.792
[Marc] That'’s what
I'’m talking about.

1:20:40.836 --> 1:20:42.838
Time to shut
this dance club down.

1:20:42.881 --> 1:20:44.970
[Mac] Oh!
That can'’t feel good!

1:20:45.014 --> 1:20:46.754
Yeah!No, it didn'’t.

1:20:46.798 --> 1:20:50.497
Rayburn!
Don'’t play his game.
Feel the rhythm.

1:20:50.541 --> 1:20:54.588
[Mac] Well, this is
way more of a match
than we were expecting.

1:20:54.632 --> 1:20:56.721
[Winnie] Come on, Rayburn.
Let me see those sweet feet.

1:20:56.764 --> 1:20:59.158
[Marc]
Coach Winnie'’s invented
a whole new style of wrestling,

1:20:59.202 --> 1:21:00.768
and Tentacular
can'’t deal with it.

1:21:00.812 --> 1:21:02.640
He looks completely lost.

1:21:02.683 --> 1:21:05.556
I'’m seeing ghosts
out there, Sig!He'’s making a joke out of us.

1:21:05.599 --> 1:21:07.950
He switches it up every time.T, look out!

1:21:07.993 --> 1:21:10.039
[Mac] Rayburn,
out of nowhere.

1:21:10.082 --> 1:21:12.041
He'’s on his heels.
Keep it up!

1:21:12.084 --> 1:21:14.826
[Marc] Oh, this is special.
I'’ve never seen a match
like this before.

1:21:14.870 --> 1:21:18.482
[Mac] Slams him down.
Oh, but Rayburn comes back
with the clothesline.

1:21:18.525 --> 1:21:20.527
I'’m not saying I was wrong,
because I'’m never wrong,

1:21:20.571 --> 1:21:24.357
but I may not have been
entirely correct
about these kids.

1:21:24.401 --> 1:21:26.925
[Mac] I mean,
this is truly incredible.

1:21:26.969 --> 1:21:29.449
I never thought
I would see the day

1:21:29.493 --> 1:21:32.496
that Marc admitted
he was wrong
about something.

1:21:32.539 --> 1:21:34.454
[Marc]
First time for everything.

1:21:35.978 --> 1:21:38.328
The round'’s almost over!
Just hold on!

1:21:38.371 --> 1:21:40.939
Holding on is the only thing
I'’m doing!

1:21:40.983 --> 1:21:44.464
[Mac] Oh, no.
Tentacular has got him.

1:21:44.508 --> 1:21:46.640
Oh, the piledriver!

1:21:46.684 --> 1:21:50.296
[Marc] What? He'’s back up?[Mac] He'’s spinning
like a B-boy!

1:21:51.036 --> 1:21:53.256
But Tentacular
was ready for it.

1:21:55.040 --> 1:21:57.608
This is not looking good
for Rayburn.

1:22:01.046 --> 1:22:02.743
[Winnie] Suckers!What?

1:22:02.787 --> 1:22:06.399
-The suckers!
-Oh!

1:22:06.443 --> 1:22:09.750
-[laughs] Sucker!
-[Marc] What is this?

1:22:09.794 --> 1:22:13.276
[Mac chuckling]
Rayburn landed
a huge blow there.

1:22:13.319 --> 1:22:15.060
Okay, Ray,
make this count!

1:22:15.104 --> 1:22:17.149
I got this, Winnie.

1:22:17.193 --> 1:22:19.804
[Marc] I can'’t believe it!
Tentacular actually looks like
he'’s in trouble!

1:22:19.847 --> 1:22:21.588
Come on!

1:22:32.904 --> 1:22:34.950
Huh?

1:22:37.822 --> 1:22:40.607

1:22:50.269 --> 1:22:53.316
[Marc] Did you see that?
Did you see that?

1:22:53.359 --> 1:22:55.100
Oh! They'’re both down!

1:22:55.144 --> 1:22:56.493

Oh, my goodness,

1:24:00.209 --> 1:24:02.385
What is even happening
right now?

1:24:08.869 --> 1:24:12.090
[Marc] Oh!
Rayburn psyched him out!
Are you kidding me?

1:24:12.134 --> 1:24:14.527
-Looks like we'’re all tied up.

1:24:15.702 --> 1:24:18.183

a Tentacle Whip. The champ'’s
up against the ropes.
