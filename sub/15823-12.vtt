was on a plane to China

Taylor: But he had filed
for divorce.

And after his wife and kid
were found murdered,

00:17.885 --> 00:20.519
he didn't have to pay alimony
or child support.

00:20.554 --> 00:22.154
And he remarried
four months later.

00:55.422 --> 00:56.389
Chief Delk.

00:56.423 --> 00:58.124
What a surprise.

00:58.158 --> 01:00.192
What can I do for you?

01:00.227 --> 01:01.294
Over the last two months,

01:01.328 --> 01:02.828
11 medical marijuana
dispensaries

01:02.863 --> 01:04.230
have been robbed
at gunpoint.

01:04.263 --> 01:06.132
Mm-hmm.

01:06.166 --> 01:07.366
And robbery/homicide
is no closer

01:07.401 --> 01:09.035
to finding the perpetrators
than they were on day one.

01:09.069 --> 01:10.703
Mm. Apparently, they're
finding it hard

01:10.737 --> 01:13.039
to care about
this little crime spree.

01:13.073 --> 01:15.541
Which is why I'm now assigning
<i>their</i> investigation

01:15.575 --> 01:16.609
to <i>your</i> division.

01:17.811 --> 01:19.679
Oh, uh,
you may not be aware,

01:19.713 --> 01:22.648
but, um, we just picked up
a case from Chief Pope.

01:22.683 --> 01:24.650
The Crawford murder's
seven years old.

01:24.685 --> 01:25.851
It can wait
a few more days.

01:25.886 --> 01:28.554
You really think these robberies
are that important?

01:28.588 --> 01:29.622
<i>Armed</i> robberies.

01:29.656 --> 01:31.590
They may not have
the violent impact

01:31.625 --> 01:33.292
of some of
your regular cases,

01:33.327 --> 01:34.460
but if we don't
stop them soon,

01:34.494 --> 01:35.494
they <i>will.</i>

01:35.529 --> 01:38.164
Hey. This is nothing new.

01:38.198 --> 01:41.801
Every incoming Chief
tries to be hands-on...

01:41.835 --> 01:43.736
till he gets caught
holding a bomb.

01:43.770 --> 01:45.338
Flynn:
We know the pattern --

01:45.372 --> 01:47.039
one Chief
centralizes everything...

01:47.074 --> 01:48.674
Then the next one
tears it apart.

01:48.709 --> 01:52.478
Major Crimes
could be on his hit list.

01:53.714 --> 01:55.514
Weren't you going down
to records

01:55.549 --> 01:56.582
to get that box
you forgot?

01:58.118 --> 02:00.152
I'm going.
I'm going.

02:00.187 --> 02:02.154
Brenda: There's an awful lot
of material here.

02:02.189 --> 02:03.489
Delk:
But the basics never change.

02:03.523 --> 02:04.623
The same three guys

02:04.658 --> 02:07.159
using the same M.O.
At each dispensary.

02:07.194 --> 02:10.128
Uh, you're not concerned
that we will be playing catch-up

02:10.163 --> 02:11.330
with robbery/homicide?

02:11.365 --> 02:13.265
Robbery/homicide,
counterterrorism,

02:13.300 --> 02:14.600
Major Crimes --

02:14.634 --> 02:16.102
I've always had my doubts

02:16.136 --> 02:18.270
about these
specialized divisions.

02:18.305 --> 02:20.906
People standing around
waiting for a crime

02:20.941 --> 02:22.641
that matches the name
of their department.

02:23.577 --> 02:26.379
And with
our hiring freeze,

02:26.413 --> 02:28.781
I need every work hour
to be well spent,

02:28.815 --> 02:30.649
even if I have to move people
to do it --

02:30.684 --> 02:32.318
like, say, uh, <i>you.</i>

02:32.352 --> 02:35.488
M-me? Move <i>me?</i>
<i>Move me where?</i>

02:35.522 --> 02:37.890
I like to have people
in their proper places.

02:37.924 --> 02:39.825
You, for example,
would make

02:39.860 --> 02:43.996
an excellent Assistant Chief
of Operations.

02:44.031 --> 02:46.165
That's Will Pope's job.

02:46.199 --> 02:48.234
And I'd like someone
with more hands-on experience

02:48.268 --> 02:49.668
in his position.

02:51.071 --> 02:54.840
We may have elite divisions,
Chief Johnson,

02:54.875 --> 02:56.675
but we don't have
elite problems.

02:56.710 --> 02:59.311
My idea of a major crime

02:59.346 --> 03:01.614
differs from that
of Will Pope.

03:03.250 --> 03:05.217
Flynn:
So now we're doing robberies?

03:05.252 --> 03:06.786
<i>Armed</i> robberies,
Lieutenant.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.220
11 in a row
by the same 3 men.

03:08.255 --> 03:10.222
That doesn't sound like
a major crime to you?

03:10.257 --> 03:13.325
Now, let's take a look
at the pattern.

03:13.360 --> 03:15.261
Our 3-man team,
all wearing motorcycle helmets,

03:15.295 --> 03:16.662
hits a medical marijuana
dispensary

03:16.696 --> 03:18.364
once every
three to four days.

03:18.398 --> 03:19.598
So we're due right now,
Chief.

03:19.633 --> 03:21.167
Gabriel:
Yeah, they target dispensaries

03:21.201 --> 03:22.735
with light security --
they rush in in the morning

03:22.769 --> 03:24.203
before customers
get in their way.

03:24.237 --> 03:25.838
I have video up
of the last robbery.

03:27.574 --> 03:28.941
Our robbers wait
just out of view

03:28.975 --> 03:30.009
of the security cameras

03:30.043 --> 03:32.611
until someone comes out,
then they go in.

03:32.646 --> 03:33.646
The two with pistols
cover the staff.

03:33.680 --> 03:35.114
Then the third comes in

03:35.148 --> 03:36.215
and covers the camera
with gold spray paint.

03:36.249 --> 03:37.883
Brenda: Why wait
for someone to leave?

03:37.918 --> 03:40.453
Why don't they just
enter directly?

03:40.487 --> 03:42.455
Most marijuana dispensaries
have electronic security doors

03:42.489 --> 03:43.722
that only unlock
from the inside.

03:43.757 --> 03:46.625
And you know this
because...

03:47.527 --> 03:50.629
My mom has a prescription
for pot.

03:52.566 --> 03:53.399
Oh.

03:53.433 --> 03:54.834
What's wrong with her?

03:54.868 --> 03:56.635
Insomnia and glaucoma.

03:56.670 --> 03:58.471
I-I have to guide her
to the door sometimes.

03:58.505 --> 03:59.538
Ever buy anything?

03:59.573 --> 04:01.073

he got the name "Buzz"?

04:01.108 --> 04:03.042
[ Chuckles ]
<i>Very</i> funny.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.777
No, Lieutenant,
you can't shop for pot

04:04.811 --> 04:06.312
unless you have a prescription
from a doctor

04:06.346 --> 04:07.446
and a photo I.D.

04:07.481 --> 04:09.115
Provenza: And, uh,
does your mother claim

04:09.149 --> 04:11.283
that this maryjane
actually helps her?

04:11.318 --> 04:12.785
I don't know,
but she sleeps all the time,

04:12.819 --> 04:14.120
and she doesn't
complain anymore...

04:14.154 --> 04:15.020
Uh-huh.

04:15.055 --> 04:16.055
...About anything.

04:19.024 --> 04:20.326
Brenda:
Well [Clears throat]

04:20.360 --> 04:23.696
Okay, so their pattern
is every three or four days.

04:23.730 --> 04:26.365
What else do these 11 stores
have in common?

04:26.399 --> 04:28.767
Other than free love
and patchouli oil?

04:28.802 --> 04:31.203
Gabriel: Um, Chief,
they're all cash heavy

04:31.238 --> 04:33.105
and with lots
of inventory.

04:33.140 --> 04:34.640
I mean, after each robbery,

04:34.674 --> 04:36.609
the dispensaries are reporting
losses in the five figures

04:36.643 --> 04:39.145
and 10 to 15 pounds
of pot missing.

04:39.179 --> 04:40.880
What's the street value
of medical marijuana?

04:40.914 --> 04:42.181
$5,000 to $20,000
a pound,

04:42.215 --> 04:44.116
and there are
always buyers.

04:44.151 --> 04:46.385
Hmm.
Better than robbing a bank.

04:46.419 --> 04:48.220
Tao: And I've checked all
the witness statements, Chief.

04:48.255 --> 04:51.290
And even though our robbers were
wearing motorcycle helmets,

04:51.324 --> 04:53.292
no one actually saw a motorcycle
leave the scene.

04:53.326 --> 04:56.028
Okay, so all the victims
of these robberies --

04:56.062 --> 04:58.464
"victims"?!

04:58.498 --> 04:59.999
Don't you mean
"drug dealers"?

05:00.033 --> 05:01.467
Lieutenant, these dispensaries

05:01.501 --> 05:03.302
are considered legal
by the state.

05:03.336 --> 05:04.937
We are sworn to protect them.
Bull.

05:05.839 --> 05:08.240
Hey. What happened
to our cold case?

05:08.275 --> 05:11.243
Uh, Chief Delk put it back
in the freezer.

05:11.278 --> 05:13.646
Gabriel: And he assigned us
to a string of armed robberies

05:13.680 --> 05:14.980
at marijuana
dispensaries.

05:15.015 --> 05:16.382
Taylor: Oh?

05:16.416 --> 05:17.550
Anyone tell Pope?

05:22.055 --> 05:24.590
Delk is changing the definition
of Major Crimes.

05:24.624 --> 05:27.593
He's blurring the lines between
you and robbery/homicide,

05:27.627 --> 05:28.994
and not only that,
he's targeting me, too.

05:29.029 --> 05:31.263
Well, he won't fire you.

05:31.298 --> 05:32.731
He could demote me
to Commander,

05:32.766 --> 05:33.999
which cuts my pension

05:34.034 --> 05:35.935
and puts me at the same rank
as Taylor.

05:35.969 --> 05:36.869
That can't happen.

05:36.903 --> 05:38.604
Well, do you have

05:38.638 --> 05:40.439
any outside offers?

05:40.473 --> 05:42.074
Uh, yeah, some.

05:42.108 --> 05:44.243
Yeah, New York, Chicago --
all private sector.

05:48.682 --> 05:49.848
unless their mother
goes, too.

05:49.883 --> 05:52.284
Why are you asking me
about my other offers?

05:52.319 --> 05:53.886
Did Delk say something?

05:53.920 --> 05:55.120
Did he outright
offer you my job?

05:55.155 --> 05:57.790
Why would you
even say that?

05:57.824 --> 05:59.258
Because he likes you...

05:59.292 --> 06:02.461
Obviously, and taking you off
a case that I gave you --

06:02.495 --> 06:03.896

indication

06:03.930 --> 06:06.565
my time at the L.A.P.D.
has come to a close.

06:09.002 --> 06:10.970

it is imperative

06:11.004 --> 06:12.738
that your division clear up
these armed robberies.

06:12.772 --> 06:14.640
Why?

06:14.674 --> 06:16.041
A failure in a case
like this

06:16.076 --> 06:17.409
would be just the excuse
Delk needs

06:17.444 --> 06:18.677

No, Mr. Dodson,
you put it up here,

37:20.319 --> 37:21.920
[ Scoffing ] How would I
have known that?

I don't think so.

37:54.153 --> 37:57.088
Okay, what possible reason
would I have to kill Shea?

37:57.122 --> 37:58.456
Maybe because
he was talking people
