13:38.752 --> 13:41.920
Pretty logically in the past,
but I've failed when it comes to

13:41.922 --> 13:43.254
But I've failed when it comes to
understanding emotions of

13:43.256 --> 13:44.756
Understanding emotions of
people, and that's been a huge

13:44.758 --> 13:45.790
People, and that's been a huge
flaw.

13:45.792 --> 13:47.425
Flaw.

14:20.827 --> 14:23.027
Bonds that will actually be
helpful, and that will carry me

14:23.029 --> 14:24.696
Helpful, and that will carry me
further, so when I tell jeremy

14:24.698 --> 14:26.164
Further, so when I tell jeremy
about something really honest,

14:26.166 --> 14:28.666

14:33.707 --> 14:36.140
Care about what he says, I want
to get to know him because it's

14:36.142 --> 14:37.075
To get to know him because it's
something I haven't taken the

14:37.077 --> 14:38.710
Something I haven't taken the
time to do before, and it might

14:38.712 --> 14:40.812
Time to do before, and it might
just make the difference in my

14:40.814 --> 14:41.045
Just make the difference in my
game.

14:41.047 --> 14:43.114

This is a conversation that

33:52.631 --> 33:53.630
This is a conversation that
doesn't need to happen right

33:53.632 --> 33:54.998
Doesn't need to happen right

I'm voting with them.
That's how I'm voting.

34:03.809 --> 34:05.475
That's how I'm voting.
That made up my mind, I wanted

34:05.477 --> 34:05.909
That made up my mind, I wanted
her gone.

34:05.911 --> 34:07.377

Talking to me.
>> it's so easy.

34:24.228 --> 34:26.596
>> it's so easy.
It's so easy to create suspicion

34:26.598 --> 34:28.565
It's so easy to create suspicion
or misdirection between peih-gee

34:28.567 --> 34:30.233
Or misdirection between peih-gee
and abi.

34:30.235 --> 34:35.938
And abi.
Peih-gee wants to vote abi.

34:35.940 --> 34:40.077
Peih-gee wants to vote abi.
So you and tash vote peih-gee.

34:40.079 --> 34:41.445
So you and tash vote peih-gee.
I can't believe how quickly

34:41.447 --> 34:44.246
I can't believe how quickly
everything changed on this

34:44.248 --> 34:48.518
Everything changed on this
tribe.

34:48.520 --> 34:50.152
Tribe.
>> I came back to this camp

34:50.155 --> 34:52.289

thinking I was done, but if I

34:52.291 --> 34:54.257
Thinking I was done, but if I
can take this cloud that's over

34:54.259 --> 34:55.826
Can take this cloud that's over
me right now and sling it over

34:55.828 --> 34:57.394
Me right now and sling it over
somebody else, I'm going to do

34:57.396 --> 34:58.795
Somebody else, I'm going to do
it.

34:58.797 --> 34:59.596
It.

Peih-gee will be voting abi, and
abi will be voting peih-gee.

35:14.746 --> 35:16.313
Abi will be voting peih-gee.
The thing about abi is you don't

35:16.315 --> 35:17.747
The thing about abi is you don't
know what you're going to get,

35:17.749 --> 35:20.550
Know what you're going to get,
and peih-gee, she's indecisive.

35:20.552 --> 35:21.618
And peih-gee, she's indecisive.
So it's hard.

35:21.620 --> 35:25.122
So it's hard.
It's a tough decision, but it

35:25.124 --> 35:26.957
It's a tough decision, but it
feels fantastic to have the

35:26.959 --> 35:28.225
Feels fantastic to have the
tables turned.

35:28.227 --> 35:30.694
Tables turned.
Savage and I were down 4-2.

35:30.696 --> 35:31.795

36:02.760 --> 36:03.894
>> jeff: Savage and tashback

36:03.896 --> 36:08.899
Grab a torch.
Dip it in and get fire.

36:08.901 --> 36:10.834
Dip it in and get fire.
As part of the ritual as tribal

36:10.836 --> 36:11.935
As part of the ritual as tribal
council, because fire represents

36:11.937 --> 36:12.502
Council, because fire represents
your life.

36:12.504 --> 36:15.338
Your life.
When your fire is gone, so are

36:15.340 --> 36:18.875
When your fire is gone, so are
you.

36:18.877 --> 36:20.544
You.
So savage, let's start by going

36:20.546 --> 36:22.312
So savage, let's start by going
back to the switch.

36:22.314 --> 36:24.147
Back to the switch.
First reaction was what?

36:24.149 --> 36:26.016
First reaction was what?
>> I couldn't process it.

36:26.018 --> 36:28.385
>> I couldn't process it.
It was too much in terms of the

36:28.387 --> 36:29.553
It was too much in terms of the
massive amount of work to get

36:29.555 --> 36:31.054
Massive amount of work to get
just reasonable shelter,

36:31.056 --> 36:32.255
Just reasonable shelter,
reasonable camp, and then to see

36:32.257 --> 36:35.292
Reasonable camp, and then to see
that there's two bayons and four

36:35.294 --> 36:37.794
That there's two bayons and four
ta keos, tough to process.

36:37.796 --> 36:39.496
Ta keos, tough to process.
>> jeff: So peih-gee, is it a

36:39.498 --> 36:42.132
>> jeff: So peih-gee, is it a
fair assumption to say savage

36:42.134 --> 36:43.800
Fair assumption to say savage
and tasha would probably be in

36:43.802 --> 36:45.001
And tasha would probably be in
trouble simply based on history.

36:45.003 --> 36:46.536
Trouble simply based on history.
>> that's how it works.

36:46.538 --> 36:47.804
>> that's how it works.
When you're in a swap and you're

In the minority from the
original tribe, you're in

36:50.642 --> 36:51.041
Original tribe, you're in
trouble.

36:51.043 --> 36:52.342
Trouble.
>> jeff: Now let's fast

36:52.344 --> 36:54.544

Happening there?
>> I was sending a signal to

37:02.487 --> 37:03.520
>> I was sending a signal to
someone on the other tribe I

37:03.522 --> 37:05.188
Someone on the other tribe I
care about, and tasha just jumps

37:05.190 --> 37:06.923
Care about, and tasha just jumps
out of nowhere and calls me a

37:06.925 --> 37:08.358
Out of nowhere and calls me a
rat, and I wasn't being a rat.

37:08.360 --> 37:09.659
Rat, and I wasn't being a rat.
I didn't feel like I was being a

37:09.661 --> 37:10.327
I didn't feel like I was being a
rat.

37:10.329 --> 37:11.428
Rat.
And that just hit me.

37:11.430 --> 37:12.529
And that just hit me.
I've had no sleep.

37:12.531 --> 37:13.730
I've had no sleep.
I've had in food.

37:13.732 --> 37:14.764
I've had in food.
I'm emotional.

37:14.766 --> 37:15.966
I'm emotional.
And honestly, I don't remember

37:15.968 --> 37:16.533
And honestly, I don't remember
it.

37:16.535 --> 37:18.268
It.
It was an emotional meltdown

37:18.270 --> 37:19.502
It was an emotional meltdown
that I don't recall.

37:19.504 --> 37:21.404
That I don't recall.
>> jeff: Tasha, I have a

37:21.406 --> 37:22.289

feeling you remember it.

37:22.290 --> 37:23.173
Feeling you remember it.
>> I do.

37:23.175 --> 37:25.075
>> I do.
And, jeff, my mama always told

37:25.077 --> 37:27.944
And, jeff, my mama always told
me, keep your family business at

37:27.946 --> 37:28.612
Me, keep your family business at
home.

37:28.614 --> 37:30.847
Home.
You know, whatever issues we

37:30.849 --> 37:32.182
You know, whatever issues we
had, we should have kept it

37:32.184 --> 37:32.949
Had, we should have kept it
amongst the family.

37:32.951 --> 37:35.518
Amongst the family.
All I know is that there was

37:35.520 --> 37:36.686
All I know is that there was
communication when our family's

37:36.688 --> 37:37.654
Communication when our family's
right here.

37:37.656 --> 37:39.723
Right here.
So my initial thought was, take

37:39.725 --> 37:41.524
So my initial thought was, take
'em out now so that we don't

37:41.526 --> 37:43.193
'em out now so that we don't
have to worry about loyalty

37:43.195 --> 37:44.961
Have to worry about loyalty
later on.

37:44.963 --> 37:45.762
Later on.

of things.

37:50.636 --> 37:52.102
Of things.
Wouldn't bit great if I could

37:52.104 --> 37:57.741
Wouldn't bit great if I could
escape without one vote?

37:57.743 --> 37:59.009
Escape without one vote?
>> jeff: Is there a plan?

37:59.011 --> 38:01.544
>> jeff: Is there a plan?
Who should go home?

38:01.546 --> 38:03.079
Who should go home?
>> I've heard so many names

38:03.081 --> 38:04.214
>> I've heard so many names
thrown around, I have no idea

38:04.216 --> 38:05.649
Thrown around, I have no idea
who is going home.

So I guess savage and tasha have
found their way from the bottom

38:17.262 --> 38:18.561
Found their way from the bottom
of the heap to the top.

38:18.563 --> 38:20.430
