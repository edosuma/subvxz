WEBVTT

00:07.790 --> 00:10.793
Ooh, make-out session.

00:10.880 --> 00:12.142
You go, girl.

00:12.229 --> 00:14.666
Eat that face.

00:14.753 --> 00:16.320
What are you looking at?

00:16.407 --> 00:18.801
This girl is chewing
this guy up.

00:18.888 --> 00:20.716
She'’s got her tongue down his...

00:20.803 --> 00:21.891
Uh-oh.

00:21.978 --> 00:22.935
What?

00:23.023 --> 00:25.416
It'’s your daughter.

00:25.503 --> 00:26.896
Oh...

00:26.983 --> 00:28.419
It'’s fine.

00:28.506 --> 00:31.335
I kept all her
old maternity clothes.

00:31.422 --> 00:33.207
Hang on.

00:33.294 --> 00:34.338
Now what?

00:34.425 --> 00:36.819
That'’s not her boyfriend.

00:36.906 --> 00:38.821
Whoa.

00:42.433 --> 00:45.393
No, that is
definitely not Luke.

00:47.134 --> 00:48.787
I can'’t believe
she'’d cheat on him.

00:48.874 --> 00:50.311
What'’s not
to believe?

00:50.398 --> 00:52.835
He'’s sweet, he'’s
loyal, he loves her.

00:52.922 --> 00:54.793
You'’re right,
he'’s asking for it.

00:56.491 --> 00:58.014
Oh, God.

00:58.101 --> 00:59.624
Now what?

00:59.711 --> 01:01.844
The old perv in 1F
is watching them, too.

01:01.931 --> 01:04.325
[harsh whisper]:
Hey, put some pants on!

01:05.804 --> 01:07.719
Stop that!

01:13.160 --> 01:15.423
Really?
3:00 a.m.?

01:15.510 --> 01:16.946
I have 3:14.

01:17.033 --> 01:18.295
Will you let me do this?

01:18.382 --> 01:19.557
Yeah.

01:19.644 --> 01:23.039
Really? 3:14?

01:23.126 --> 01:25.172
Really?
Trying to be a mom?

01:25.259 --> 01:26.434
Have you been drinking?

01:26.521 --> 01:28.392
I'’m not doing this.

01:28.479 --> 01:29.872
We saw you outside
with that guy.

01:29.959 --> 01:31.134
Oh, whatever.

01:31.221 --> 01:32.527
Why are you
cheating on Luke?

01:32.614 --> 01:34.137
Good night.

01:34.224 --> 01:35.921
And why are you dressed
like a cheap hooker?

01:36.008 --> 01:39.708
Yeah, next time you want
to borrow my clothes, ask first!

01:57.465 --> 01:58.988
Oh, God.

01:59.075 --> 02:00.468
I need a drink.

02:00.555 --> 02:01.643
What'’s the matter?

02:01.730 --> 02:03.079
You know that weird smell

02:03.166 --> 02:04.602
from Mrs. Valinski'’s apartment

02:04.689 --> 02:05.908
that everyone'’s been
complaining about?

02:05.995 --> 02:06.909
Yeah.

02:06.996 --> 02:09.520
It'’s Mrs. Valinski.

02:09.607 --> 02:10.739
Oh, God, no.

02:10.826 --> 02:12.567
Yeah.

02:12.654 --> 02:14.438
She must'’ve been there
for a couple of days.

02:14.525 --> 02:16.397
She looked like
a beanbag chair in a nightgown.

02:17.746 --> 02:19.226
That'’s so sad.

02:19.313 --> 02:20.488
You want
to know sad?

02:20.575 --> 02:22.142
All her jewelry--

02:22.229 --> 02:24.318
fake.

02:24.405 --> 02:25.362
You didn'’t.

02:25.449 --> 02:27.277
Why would I?

02:27.364 --> 02:28.844
[knocking at door]

02:28.931 --> 02:31.760
That'’s probably the cops.

02:31.847 --> 02:33.544
Nice.

02:33.631 --> 02:35.459
Cops at the door,
and it'’s not about us.

02:38.723 --> 02:39.637
Hey.

02:39.724 --> 02:41.204
Oh. Luke. Hi.

02:41.291 --> 02:42.858
Is, uh, Violet here?

02:42.945 --> 02:44.816
She'’s still sleeping.
Can I give her a message?

02:44.903 --> 02:46.427
Uh, yeah.

02:46.514 --> 02:48.211
I was just worried about her.

02:48.298 --> 02:50.039
I'’ve been texting her
for a couple days now,

02:50.126 --> 02:50.996
and she doesn'’t answer.

02:51.083 --> 02:52.172
Is that so?

02:52.259 --> 02:53.347
Is something going on

02:53.434 --> 02:54.478
that I should know about?

02:54.565 --> 02:55.827
Yes. Violet is sick.

02:55.914 --> 02:57.177
Very sick.

02:57.264 --> 03:00.180
Where'’s the body?

03:00.267 --> 03:01.659
Oh, my God!

03:01.746 --> 03:03.879
Oh, no, no.

03:03.966 --> 03:05.054
No, not that sick.

03:05.141 --> 03:06.534
Upstairs.

03:06.621 --> 03:08.362
The door'’s open.
Follow your nose.

03:08.449 --> 03:09.885
She just got a stomach bug.

03:09.972 --> 03:10.886
Puking her guts out.

03:10.973 --> 03:12.148
[exhales]

03:12.235 --> 03:13.541
Hey, what'’s going on?

03:13.628 --> 03:15.586
Oh, Luke just came by
to see Violet,

03:15.673 --> 03:17.545
and I told him the reason
she hasn'’t been calling him back

03:17.632 --> 03:18.937
is '’cause she'’s sick.

03:19.024 --> 03:21.244
Oh, right.
Nasty head cold.

03:21.331 --> 03:23.681
At first. And then it morphed
into the stomach bug

03:23.768 --> 03:24.987
I just told Luke about.

03:25.074 --> 03:27.555
Yeah, yeah,

03:27.642 --> 03:29.252
it'’s that morphin'’ thing
that'’s going around.

03:31.602 --> 03:33.778
It'’s morphin'’ season.

03:33.865 --> 03:35.780
Well, can I
do anything?

03:35.867 --> 03:36.955
Uh, get her
some soup?

03:37.042 --> 03:39.044
Oh, you are just
the sweetest.

03:39.131 --> 03:41.569
Yeah, you gotta quit that.

03:41.656 --> 03:43.005
Here, you want to help?

03:43.092 --> 03:44.398
Go to the store,

03:44.485 --> 03:45.703
get a half dozen cans
of air freshener

03:45.790 --> 03:46.835
and a couple of chocolate bars.

03:46.922 --> 03:48.271
Chocolate bars?

03:48.358 --> 03:49.664
Dead people
tweak my sweet tooth.

03:49.751 --> 03:52.014
Go.

03:53.972 --> 03:55.147
Head cold?

03:55.235 --> 03:56.584
How many times
have I told you?

03:56.671 --> 03:58.238
When there is a lie
already in motion,

03:58.325 --> 03:59.587
always follow the leader.

03:59.674 --> 04:00.979
Never add new information.

04:02.720 --> 04:05.288
No one is more disappointed
in me than me.

04:09.292 --> 04:10.250
Get up.

04:10.337 --> 04:11.599
Leave me alone.

04:11.686 --> 04:12.643
Now!

04:12.730 --> 04:14.079
What is your problem?

04:14.166 --> 04:16.125
I just had to lie
to your boyfriend.

04:16.212 --> 04:17.909
And she did a really bad job.

04:19.084 --> 04:20.172
Just so you know,

04:20.260 --> 04:21.957
you were home sick last night.

04:22.043 --> 04:24.481
You had a stomach bug that
morphed into a head cold.

04:24.568 --> 04:26.222
Head cold into a stomach bug.

04:26.309 --> 04:27.789
You'’re still doing a bad job.

04:27.876 --> 04:30.095
Sorry. I'’m a little rusty.

04:30.182 --> 04:32.402
You'’ll get it back.
It'’s like stealing a bike.

04:33.621 --> 04:35.013
I didn'’t ask you to lie.

04:35.100 --> 04:36.754
No, you forced us to.

04:36.841 --> 04:38.278
CHRISTY:
For reasons I
don'’t understand,

04:38.365 --> 04:39.931
that kid loves you.

04:40.018 --> 04:41.890
She was an easy lay.
What'’s hard to understand?

04:43.370 --> 04:44.806
And it'’s not
just Luke.

04:44.893 --> 04:46.677
You'’ve been treating
everyone like crap.

04:46.764 --> 04:49.027
You'’ve been lying, drinking,
staying out all night...

04:49.114 --> 04:50.115
Get off my back.

04:50.202 --> 04:51.291
I just gave up a baby.

04:51.378 --> 04:52.727
Oh, give me a break.

04:52.814 --> 04:54.294
That'’s your excuse
for everything.

04:54.381 --> 04:55.773
The other day,
you couldn'’t do the dishes

04:55.860 --> 04:57.645
'’cause you
"just gave up a baby."

04:57.732 --> 04:59.429
You two could never
understand what...

04:59.516 --> 05:01.213
Understand what you'’ve
been going through.

05:01.301 --> 05:02.693
You sound like a broken record.

05:02.780 --> 05:04.347
Not that you know
what a record is.

05:04.434 --> 05:05.914
I don'’t want to talk
about this with you.

05:06.001 --> 05:07.307
Fine.

05:07.394 --> 05:08.612
But you have to talk
with someone.

05:10.048 --> 05:11.441
Why don'’t you
see a therapist?

05:11.528 --> 05:13.008
There are people
at the free clinic.

05:13.095 --> 05:14.183
It doesn'’t cost anything.

05:14.270 --> 05:16.403
No way I am seeing a shrink.

05:16.490 --> 05:18.187
Why? You can'’t be embarrassed.

05:18.274 --> 05:20.058
For God'’s sake,
your water broke at the prom.

05:20.145 --> 05:21.495
You can'’t top that.

05:21.582 --> 05:23.540
Oh, forget it.

05:30.939 --> 05:32.157
So there'’s free therapy?

05:32.244 --> 05:34.203
Yeah.

05:34.290 --> 05:36.553
Why haven'’t you been going?

05:39.948 --> 05:41.428
[doorbell rings]

05:41.515 --> 05:44.169
It'’s open.

05:44.256 --> 05:45.257
Hey.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.998
Hey.

05:47.085 --> 05:48.478
Where is everyone?

05:48.565 --> 05:50.524
Mom went to pick Roscoe
up from school

05:50.611 --> 05:54.266
and Grandma'’s organizing
a dead lady'’s yard sale.

05:54.354 --> 05:55.355
Okay.

05:55.442 --> 05:56.486
What'’s up with you?

05:56.573 --> 05:58.488
Nothing.

05:58.575 --> 05:59.446
Nothing'’s cool.

06:01.491 --> 06:04.886
I'’m salesman of the month
at my car dealership.

06:04.973 --> 06:06.714
Good for you.

06:06.801 --> 06:08.672
That'’s why I
got this pin.

06:10.631 --> 06:13.024
They gave me a pin.

06:13.111 --> 06:15.810
Awesome.

06:15.897 --> 06:19.204
Brr. Frosty.

06:22.904 --> 06:24.384
Something
bothering you?

06:24.471 --> 06:25.994
No.

06:26.081 --> 06:28.213
Violet, I was your
stepdad for six years.

06:28.300 --> 06:29.519
I can read you
pretty well.

06:29.606 --> 06:30.999
It was four years.

06:31.086 --> 06:32.522
Wow.

06:32.609 --> 06:34.698
Your mom really made
it feel like longer.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.007
She wants me to go to therapy.

06:39.094 --> 06:40.095
Why?

06:40.182 --> 06:41.444
Who knows?

06:41.531 --> 06:42.880
Doesn'’t matter. I'’m not going.

06:42.967 --> 06:44.752
You should.

06:44.839 --> 06:47.363
It'’s a priceless opportunity
to piss her off.

06:50.148 --> 06:51.889
What do you mean?

06:51.976 --> 06:54.544
You get your
life together,

06:54.631 --> 06:57.373
and then she is forced
to look at her own.

06:57.460 --> 07:00.028
And, Violet, believe
me when I tell you

07:00.115 --> 07:02.073
she hates that.

07:02.160 --> 07:04.859
You got smarter
when you stopped smoking weed.

07:06.556 --> 07:08.166
She hates that, too.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.476
Man, free clinics
are so cool.

07:13.563 --> 07:16.174
Check this out.
Free mammograms, flu shots,

07:16.261 --> 07:18.220
STD testing, diabetes screening

07:18.307 --> 07:21.441
and, I kid you not,
calligraphy classes.

07:21.528 --> 07:23.791
Oh, that'’s nice.

07:23.878 --> 07:25.575
Send a beautiful,
handwritten note

07:25.662 --> 07:27.098
to all your former sex partners

07:27.185 --> 07:28.752
that you gave them herpes.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.234
You have any idea
why Violet changed her mind

07:32.321 --> 07:33.583
about going to therapy?

07:33.670 --> 07:35.846
Mmm. I gotta assume

07:35.933 --> 07:38.109
that she needed to process
what I said to her

07:38.196 --> 07:39.676
and eventually came
to the right decision.

07:41.722 --> 07:42.853
Just let me assume that!

07:44.594 --> 07:45.987
You ever think
about seeing a therapist?

07:46.074 --> 07:47.118
Nah, I'’m good.

07:48.772 --> 07:50.644
I need to believe I'’m good!

07:50.731 --> 07:52.559
You don'’t have any issues.

07:52.646 --> 07:55.344
Hey, we'’re here
to support Violet

07:55.431 --> 07:56.998
so she can deal
with her issues.

07:57.085 --> 07:58.826
This is not about me;
it'’s about her.

08:00.567 --> 08:02.482
The therapist wants you
to join our session.

08:02.569 --> 08:04.353
Son of a bitch!

08:04.440 --> 08:07.095
I think this just became
about you.

08:08.270 --> 08:09.793
He wants you
in there, too.

08:09.880 --> 08:11.839
Son of a bitch!

08:11.926 --> 08:13.318
Ha-ha!

08:15.407 --> 08:17.540
Just want you to know,
everything discussed here

08:17.627 --> 08:19.716
is protected
by doctor-patient privilege.

08:19.803 --> 08:20.978
This is a safe space.

08:21.065 --> 08:22.632
You can say anything you'’d like.

08:22.719 --> 08:25.679
Okay, I'’d like to say,
"When is your bedtime?"

08:27.550 --> 08:29.117
I assure you,
I'’m completely qualified.

08:29.204 --> 08:32.511
I may look young,
but I'’m actually 23 and a half.

08:33.948 --> 08:35.123
Free clinic.

08:35.210 --> 08:37.212
You get what you pay for.

08:37.299 --> 08:39.256
Now, Violet, you have something
you wanted to share?

08:39.344 --> 08:41.216
Yeah. You
ruined my life.

08:41.303 --> 08:43.347
Ah-ah-ah. Say it like
you did to the puppet.

08:43.434 --> 08:46.003
"I'’m angry because..."

08:48.310 --> 08:50.791
I am angry because...

08:50.878 --> 08:52.575
you totally screwed up
my chances

08:52.662 --> 08:54.664
of having a healthy relationship
with a man.

08:54.751 --> 08:56.623
You'’re looking
at her, right?

08:58.320 --> 08:59.843
I'’m looking at both of you.

08:59.930 --> 09:02.280
I thought you were
supposed to help her

09:02.367 --> 09:03.673
get over giving up the baby.

09:03.760 --> 09:05.066
VIOLET:
It'’s all tied together.

09:05.153 --> 09:06.763
If I wasn'’t so
messed up with guys,

09:06.850 --> 09:08.243
I probably wouldn'’t have
even gotten pregnant.

09:08.330 --> 09:10.898
See what I did there?

09:10.985 --> 09:13.248
Wait, it'’s my fault
you got pregnant?

09:13.335 --> 09:15.119
I believe the point
Violet is trying to make

09:15.206 --> 09:17.165
is that there was a lack
of male role models

09:17.252 --> 09:18.427
that she could look up to.

09:18.514 --> 09:19.907
You drove
Alvin away.

09:19.994 --> 09:21.169
You drove
Baxter away.

09:21.256 --> 09:22.692
And I never even
knew my father.

09:22.779 --> 09:24.781
Hey, your
father left me.

09:24.868 --> 09:26.000
You were a drunken mess.

09:26.087 --> 09:27.131
Of course he did.

09:27.218 --> 09:28.611
You know what?

09:28.698 --> 09:29.656
We'’re not here
to talk about him.

09:29.743 --> 09:30.831
See?

09:30.918 --> 09:32.006
This is what
she always does.

09:32.093 --> 09:33.268
Whenever I ask
about my dad,

09:33.355 --> 09:34.704
she shuts
me down.

09:34.791 --> 09:36.271
I don'’t know a thing
about that guy.

09:36.358 --> 09:37.446
How screwed up is that?

09:37.533 --> 09:39.100
In my professional opinion,

09:39.187 --> 09:40.797
I would suggest
that Violet has a right

09:40.884 --> 09:42.146
to know some information
about her father.

09:42.233 --> 09:43.495
Oh, really?

09:43.583 --> 09:45.410
You have
a "professional opinion"?

09:47.195 --> 09:49.066
Maybe. I mean...

09:49.153 --> 09:52.200
Honestly, sometimes
you just say things.

09:52.287 --> 09:55.856
Look, she'’s drinking,
she'’s cheating on her boyfriend.

09:55.943 --> 09:57.640
Shouldn'’t we focus on that?

09:57.727 --> 09:59.773
I bet you I would be
a much happier person

09:59.860 --> 10:01.470
if you were the one
that took off,

10:01.557 --> 10:02.906
and I grew up with my father.

10:02.993 --> 10:04.952
Oh, boy, would you
lose that bet.

10:05.039 --> 10:07.824
Mom, no.
Shush. You don'’t
know anything.

10:07.911 --> 10:10.000
Mom, please.
She'’s 18.
She can hear it.

10:10.087 --> 10:11.785
You want to know
the truth?
Mom!

10:11.872 --> 10:14.483
Your father used to beat
the crap out of my daughter.

10:14.570 --> 10:15.702
Stop.

10:15.789 --> 10:17.312
He sent her
to the ER twice.

10:17.399 --> 10:20.271
I seriously doubt you'’d
be happier living with him.

10:30.891 --> 10:32.762
[door opens, closes]

10:39.116 --> 10:41.379
Why didn'’t you tell me?

10:41.466 --> 10:43.381
Because I never
wanted you to know.

10:43.468 --> 10:44.774
You looked in my direction.

10:44.861 --> 10:46.167
Does that mean
we'’re speaking again?

10:47.559 --> 10:48.865
So, no.

10:48.952 --> 10:50.911
How long did you
stay with him?

10:50.998 --> 10:52.782
Too long.

10:52.869 --> 10:54.915
Well, it wasn'’t as if
I had you to run home to.

10:55.002 --> 10:57.526
Hey, at that time in my life,
I was in my own prison.

10:57.613 --> 11:00.050
Prison.

11:00.137 --> 11:02.096
I want to meet him.

11:02.183 --> 11:04.228
What?!Did you not get
what he did to your mother?

11:04.315 --> 11:06.927
Yeah, he sounds
like a total loser.

11:07.014 --> 11:09.581
But he'’s still my father,
and I have a right to know him.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.671
This is exactly why I didn'’t
want her to find out.

11:11.758 --> 11:12.802
Maybe he'’s changed.

11:12.889 --> 11:14.761
People like that
don'’t change.

11:14.848 --> 11:16.763
Aren'’t you in a program
that'’s all about second chances?

11:16.850 --> 11:18.112
I mean, you guys keep saying

11:18.199 --> 11:20.114
that you turned
your lives around.

11:20.201 --> 11:22.116
Isn'’t it possible that my dad
became a half-decent guy?

11:22.203 --> 11:23.117
It'’s not the same.

11:23.204 --> 11:24.945
Just because you say so?

11:25.032 --> 11:26.947
I want to hear his side
of the story.

11:27.034 --> 11:29.297
You think he has a side?!

11:30.428 --> 11:31.647
That'’s it.

11:31.734 --> 11:32.996
Christy!
Cars! Truck!

11:33.083 --> 11:34.824
[car honks]

11:34.911 --> 11:36.391
You want to meet him,
we'’re gonna meet him.

11:36.478 --> 11:39.089
Great.
Great.

11:39.176 --> 11:41.048
What are you doing?

11:45.182 --> 11:47.097
The first U-turn was
just to be dramatic.

11:47.184 --> 11:49.056
It'’s actually
this way.

11:53.408 --> 11:54.409
You sure you know
what you'’re doing?

11:54.496 --> 11:55.410
Yeah.

11:58.195 --> 12:00.154
Okay.

12:00.241 --> 12:02.112
Here he is.

12:04.245 --> 12:06.987
"James Sutcliff."

12:07.074 --> 12:08.640
I thought his name was Butch.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.468
Butch was
his nickname.

12:10.555 --> 12:12.427
Oh.

12:12.514 --> 12:14.298
Do you know how he died?

12:14.385 --> 12:16.823
Car accident.

12:16.910 --> 12:20.740
Anyway, I know this isn'’t
how you wanted to meet him,

12:20.827 --> 12:22.829
but here'’s your dad.

12:22.916 --> 12:26.441
Why couldn'’t you have
been a cool guy?

12:26.528 --> 12:28.660
He was cool.

12:28.748 --> 12:30.619
He was so cool,
I couldn'’t even believe

12:30.706 --> 12:32.447
he wanted
to go out with me.

12:32.534 --> 12:33.927
What happened?

12:34.014 --> 12:36.973
The first few months
were fun.

12:37.060 --> 12:41.804
Then one night, we were doing
tequila shots with his friends.

12:41.891 --> 12:44.807
He came in and said,
"Kirk Cobain just died."

12:44.894 --> 12:48.463
And I said, "No, genius,
it'’s Kurt, with a T."

12:48.550 --> 12:50.465
And everyone laughed.

12:50.552 --> 12:52.467
It was no big deal.

12:52.554 --> 12:55.949
Then everyone cried because,
you know, Kurt Cobain died.

12:57.559 --> 12:59.648
Then we get in the
car to go home,

12:59.735 --> 13:02.651
and he starts yelling at
me for embarrassing him.

13:02.738 --> 13:05.306
His reaction was so crazy,
I thought he was kidding.

13:05.393 --> 13:07.264
So I laughed.

13:09.440 --> 13:12.792
He slapped me so hard,
I heard a ringing in my ears.

13:14.968 --> 13:16.447
That was the beginning.

13:20.321 --> 13:23.237
I packed my bags
so many times,

13:23.324 --> 13:25.761
but he always said
that he loved me

13:25.848 --> 13:29.243
and it would never
happen again.

13:29.330 --> 13:32.289
Until it did.

13:32.376 --> 13:36.250
After a while, I just started
feeling like I deserved it.

13:38.252 --> 13:41.211
Anyway...

13:41.298 --> 13:43.170
that'’s my side.

13:50.699 --> 13:52.309
I'’ll be in the car.

13:57.401 --> 13:59.012
So...

13:59.099 --> 14:01.014
Who the hell is
James Sutcliff?

14:01.101 --> 14:02.972
[sighs]

14:06.933 --> 14:10.197
No idea.

14:10.284 --> 14:12.373
But I would rather
Violet think Butch is dead

14:12.460 --> 14:14.375
than ever go looking
for that monster.

14:14.462 --> 14:16.768
I get it.

14:16.856 --> 14:18.727
I'’m sorry I called
you a bad liar.

14:18.814 --> 14:20.076
You'’re a great liar.

14:20.163 --> 14:22.426
Thanks, coach.

14:22.513 --> 14:25.473
Means a lot
coming from you.

14:25.560 --> 14:28.041
I'’m also sorry I
wasn'’t there for you.

14:30.391 --> 14:32.262
You'’re here now.

14:34.830 --> 14:36.440
[sighs]

14:36.527 --> 14:39.269
Sorry for dragging you
into this, James Sutcliff.

14:39.356 --> 14:42.272
I'’m sure you were
a very nice man.

14:42.359 --> 14:44.274
She'’s looking.
She'’s looking.

14:44.361 --> 14:46.798
I hope you rot in hell,
you miserable bastard!

14:53.196 --> 14:55.720
Why'’d you spit
on my husband'’s grave?

14:57.200 --> 14:58.462
Oh.

14:58.549 --> 15:00.073
I think you know.

15:05.774 --> 15:06.731
When'’s Mom gonna
be back?

15:06.818 --> 15:08.124
Shouldn'’t be long.

15:08.211 --> 15:09.299
She took your
sister to therapy.

15:09.386 --> 15:10.344
Oh.

15:10.431 --> 15:11.780
What'’s therapy?

15:11.867 --> 15:13.738
You'’ll find out
soon enough.

15:16.219 --> 15:18.613
Hey, guess who made
salesman of the month.

15:18.700 --> 15:19.962
You told me.

15:20.049 --> 15:21.268
They gave you a pin.

15:21.355 --> 15:23.618
[door opens]

15:24.967 --> 15:26.012
Hey.

15:26.099 --> 15:27.317
Hey, what took you
so long?

15:27.404 --> 15:29.580
Sorry, we had to make
a couple of stops.

15:29.667 --> 15:30.973
Is that frozen yogurt?

15:31.060 --> 15:33.584
Yep, dead people tweak
my sweet tooth.

15:35.456 --> 15:37.197
I'’m gonna change
and then head over to Luke'’s.

15:37.284 --> 15:39.068
Remember-- you'’re recovering
from a stomach bug

15:39.155 --> 15:40.722
that morphed into a head cold.

15:40.809 --> 15:43.029
You keep reversing it.Head cold, stomach bug.

15:43.116 --> 15:45.596
Just say "diarrhea."
He won'’t ask any questions.

15:46.771 --> 15:47.990
Baxter, kitchen.

15:48.077 --> 15:49.687
What did I do?

15:49.774 --> 15:52.299
The bitch be crazy.
Does it matter?

15:53.735 --> 15:54.997
Sit down.

15:55.084 --> 15:56.042
Oh, boy.

15:56.129 --> 15:56.956
Relax.

15:57.043 --> 15:58.305
You'’re not in trouble.

15:59.959 --> 16:01.786
Then what are we gonna
talk about?

16:04.137 --> 16:07.357
So, listen, some stuff
came up in therapy,

16:07.444 --> 16:11.840
and it got me thinking
about our relationship.

16:11.927 --> 16:14.495
And I'’m notin trouble?

16:14.582 --> 16:17.541
No.

16:17.628 --> 16:19.543
Remember what I told you
about Violet'’s dad?

16:19.630 --> 16:21.415
Yeah, I remember.

16:21.502 --> 16:23.025
Bad guy.

16:23.112 --> 16:26.594
Yeah, well, I was really
messed up after that,

16:26.681 --> 16:29.727
and you kind of paid
the price for it.

16:29.814 --> 16:33.122
Is that Freudian for you
were really mean to me?

16:35.124 --> 16:37.039
I'’m so sorry.

16:37.126 --> 16:39.085
You were
a stand-up guy,

16:39.172 --> 16:42.044
and I just couldn'’t
appreciate it.

16:42.131 --> 16:44.394
Wow.

16:44.481 --> 16:46.266
Thanks.

16:46.353 --> 16:48.442
Thank you.

16:48.529 --> 16:52.054
I have a girlfriend, so I
can'’t make out with you.

16:52.141 --> 16:53.186
Baxter.

16:53.273 --> 16:55.405
Although she
isn'’t here...

16:55.492 --> 16:57.668
And neither am I.

16:59.279 --> 17:01.150
Now I'’m in trouble.

17:05.198 --> 17:06.112
Hey.

17:06.199 --> 17:07.113
Hey.

17:07.200 --> 17:09.289
How'’d it go with Luke?

17:09.376 --> 17:12.248
I told him I made out
with another guy,

17:12.335 --> 17:14.294
and he broke up with me.

17:14.381 --> 17:17.252
So, pretty much the perfect end
to the perfect day.

17:17.339 --> 17:18.298
I'’m sorry.

17:19.473 --> 17:20.996
It'’s okay.

17:21.083 --> 17:23.390
I haven'’t exactly been
the best girlfriend.

17:25.479 --> 17:28.263
Or daughter, but that probably
goes without saying.

17:28.351 --> 17:31.920
No, it doesn'’t.

17:32.007 --> 17:34.488
Say it.

17:34.575 --> 17:36.446
Mom, it never occurred to me

17:36.533 --> 17:38.405
that it could
have been his fault.

17:42.496 --> 17:44.802
When you look at
me, is it just...

17:48.415 --> 17:51.113
Am I just a constant
reminder of a terrible time?

17:51.200 --> 17:52.593
Are you kidding?

17:54.073 --> 17:56.553
Just the opposite.

17:56.640 --> 17:58.512
I might not be here
without you.

17:58.599 --> 17:59.556
I don'’t understand.

17:59.643 --> 18:00.731
What do you mean?

18:00.818 --> 18:02.472
When I found out
I was pregnant,

18:02.559 --> 18:04.822
I knew it wasn'’t just
about me anymore.

18:06.737 --> 18:09.653
You gave me
the courage to leave.

18:09.740 --> 18:11.351
You saved my life.

18:13.527 --> 18:14.919
Well, good, then.

18:17.400 --> 18:19.315
[sighs]

18:19.402 --> 18:20.577
It'’s been a long day.

18:20.664 --> 18:21.796
I'’ll see you
in the morning.

18:31.849 --> 18:34.113
So... how do we do this?

18:34.200 --> 18:35.810
Uh, well, why don'’t
you just tell me

18:35.897 --> 18:37.028
what'’s going on
in your life?

18:37.116 --> 18:38.682
What'’s been bothering you?

18:38.769 --> 18:42.686
Okay, well, let'’s see...

18:44.297 --> 18:45.428
Bonnie,
could you please join us?

18:45.515 --> 18:46.951
Son of a bitch!
