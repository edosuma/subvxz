[Lisa clears throat]

00:25.734 --> 00:29.195
If this is going to end with a bullet
in my head, just tell me now.

00:32.157 --> 00:33.158
[Sam clears throat]

00:33.616 --> 00:34.659
Um...

00:35.493 --> 00:38.538
When you got in touch before,
I wasn't ready to have this conversation,

00:38.621 --> 00:40.248
but thanks for making the effort.

00:41.166 --> 00:42.000
Of course.

00:42.083 --> 00:44.210
I-- I-- I really wanted the chance
to apologize,

00:44.294 --> 00:45.545
-and just to try to do--
-No.

00:45.712 --> 00:46.713
I mean there's...

00:47.130 --> 00:48.548
nothing, you can say.

00:49.090 --> 00:50.133
Okay.

00:50.592 --> 00:53.595
Uh, look,
with Max's bachelor party coming up,

00:53.678 --> 00:58.224
Marianne thought it would be a good idea
for me to sit down with you beforehand.

00:58.308 --> 01:00.727
I'm-- I'm so glad that you reached out.

01:01.603 --> 01:04.773
It'd be so much easier, if I never had to
see you again, but that is...

01:05.440 --> 01:06.733
not a reality, so--

01:06.816 --> 01:09.152
I could kill myself. [chuckles]

01:13.073 --> 01:14.991
Obviously we're never going to be friends
again,

01:15.075 --> 01:16.868
but we can be civil.

01:17.660 --> 01:19.162
I'd like to be able to be in the same room

01:19.245 --> 01:21.372
without it being an issue
for other people.

01:21.498 --> 01:24.876
I actually wrote a letter that I'd
really love the opportunity to...

01:25.585 --> 01:26.753
-read to you.
-No.

01:31.925 --> 01:33.134
You could...

01:33.259 --> 01:34.469
-take it to go.
-No, thank you.

01:36.012 --> 01:37.764
But I do want to ask you something.

01:38.139 --> 01:38.973
Anything.

01:39.808 --> 01:42.018
Remember that time,
we all went to Killington,

01:42.102 --> 01:44.771
and we rented that ski-in
ski-out house?

01:45.146 --> 01:48.483
Of course. Yeah, the place
with all the pewter stuff,

01:48.566 --> 01:50.485
-and the shag rug.
-Yes, right, that one.

01:51.569 --> 01:52.654
That was really nice.

01:53.363 --> 01:54.739
Yeah, I loved that trip.

01:55.198 --> 01:57.826
But now I keep thinking about how
you and Ethan...

01:58.618 --> 01:59.577
stayed behind...

01:59.702 --> 02:02.705
that one day, when we all went skiing.
Do you remember that?

02:04.040 --> 02:04.874
Kind of.

02:07.460 --> 02:10.588
That whole trip is tainted for me now.
I'm sure you understand.

02:11.798 --> 02:12.632
Absolutely.

02:13.466 --> 02:17.137
You see, times that I thought
were really happy...

02:18.054 --> 02:18.888
weren't.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.934
Turns out I didn't understand what was
happening in my own life.

02:24.644 --> 02:26.146
It makes me feel dumb,

02:27.438 --> 02:28.565
and it makes me feel sad.

02:31.943 --> 02:32.777
Oh, well,

02:33.862 --> 02:34.863
For what it's worth.

02:36.114 --> 02:37.615
Nothing happened on that trip.

02:39.075 --> 02:40.702
Well, for what it's worth,

02:41.327 --> 02:43.329
I'll never believe another word you say.

02:49.794 --> 02:51.921
[theme music plays]

03:03.516 --> 03:04.851
This is crazy.

03:04.976 --> 03:06.394
I know they're here somewhere.

03:06.895 --> 03:09.189
You can buy me sunglasses at the airport.

03:09.856 --> 03:10.732
Relax.

03:10.815 --> 03:13.359
Look. You and Lisa are going to be fine.

03:13.526 --> 03:15.278
It's easy for you to say.

03:15.570 --> 03:18.156
It was brutal.
I mean I deserved it, but...

03:19.115 --> 03:20.033
it was brutal.

03:20.116 --> 03:21.784
You know, I'm just glad that you and Lisa

03:21.868 --> 03:24.621
are taking the first step toward
everything getting better

03:24.704 --> 03:28.750
Uh, there's no universe in which
things get better between me and Lisa.

03:29.417 --> 03:30.460
You never know.

03:30.543 --> 03:32.045
Trust me. I know.

03:32.378 --> 03:35.965
Just going to lie low tonight
and be human elevator music.

03:36.132 --> 03:37.759
Is that why you're wearing full beige?

03:38.009 --> 03:38.843
Yeah.

03:39.469 --> 03:41.721
Oh yeah, you're really going to disappear
in that thing.

03:41.804 --> 03:43.973
Oh, almost didn't see you coming.

03:44.349 --> 03:45.558
-Right?
-Yeah.

03:45.642 --> 03:47.477
Hello, gentlemen.

03:47.644 --> 03:49.020
Do not say gentlemen.

03:49.145 --> 03:50.772
-That's the grossest word.
-It is?

03:50.855 --> 03:51.689
Really?

03:51.773 --> 03:52.732
-Yes!
-All right.

03:53.107 --> 03:54.067
Hello players.

03:54.192 --> 03:56.861
-See, gentlemen, much better.
-I was wrong. You're right. Thank you.

03:56.945 --> 03:57.904
Where's Merrill Morgan?

03:58.905 --> 03:59.739
Couldn't make it.

03:59.822 --> 04:00.823
I'm in the doghouse.

04:00.990 --> 04:01.824
Really?

04:02.408 --> 04:04.535
I was kind of hoping she'd be here
to keep you in check.

04:04.786 --> 04:07.288
Gonna take a lot more than Merrill Morgan
to tame this pony dog.

04:07.413 --> 04:08.623
All right, yeah, get on there.

04:09.207 --> 04:11.084
[both mimicking horse noises]

04:12.377 --> 04:14.879
-Get out of here, girl! Get out of here.
-Save it, save it.

04:15.004 --> 04:16.256
Save it for the bachelor party.

04:16.339 --> 04:19.217
-Save it for the bachelor party.
-Why the "save it for the bachelor party"?

04:19.300 --> 04:21.177
You said it was going to be
a co-ed classy affair.

04:21.302 --> 04:22.470
-That was the theme?
-Relax.

04:22.553 --> 04:23.930
I mean, define classy, bro.

04:24.055 --> 04:26.015
Guys, please! You know.

at Eleven Madison Park?

04:28.393 --> 04:30.103
-Stop. Okay.
-Max, relax, man.

04:30.186 --> 04:33.356
-This is going to be way better. Trust me.
-All right. Just no strip clubs, okay?

04:33.439 --> 04:35.024
-I don't want that.
-Somebody's horned up.

04:35.149 --> 04:36.109
He sure is.

04:36.359 --> 04:37.318
I'm not horned up.

04:37.902 --> 04:39.487
-I'm not horned up!
-This guy cannot stop

04:39.570 --> 04:40.989
-talking about strippers.
-I know.

04:41.072 --> 04:42.740
No, I'm saying I don't want to
go to a club

04:42.824 --> 04:44.826
-and have like an oiled-up guy
-Oiled-up?

04:44.909 --> 04:46.160
asking me where I'm from.

04:46.244 --> 04:47.370
I'm sorry, you said oiled-up.

04:47.537 --> 04:48.371
-That's horny.
-Yeah.

04:48.454 --> 04:50.415
-Because that's what they do there.
-Was it like a muscled and chiseled guy?

04:50.498 --> 04:53.793
-Chiseled guys making small talk?
-I'm turned off at the prospect

04:53.876 --> 04:55.628
-of going there.
-Understood.

04:55.837 --> 04:57.547
-No strip clubs.
-No strip clubs.

04:57.922 --> 04:58.756
Gross.

04:59.048 --> 04:59.924
-Good.
-Thank you.

05:00.008 --> 05:01.134
-Yeah.
-Alright.

05:01.217 --> 05:02.635
Okay, here we go.

Hey, you can--

05:04.512 --> 05:06.014
you can vouch his plan, right?

05:06.472 --> 05:07.640
100 percent.

05:09.350 --> 05:11.394
I mean-- I actually I have no idea
what the plan is,

05:11.477 --> 05:12.478
but yes, absolutely.

05:12.562 --> 05:13.855
Oh, shit!

05:13.980 --> 05:14.814
Really?

05:18.818 --> 05:20.236
You got a private jet?

05:20.528 --> 05:21.446
Yeah.

05:21.529 --> 05:23.364
-What!
-Gulfstream V, baby.

05:23.448 --> 05:24.449
-Oh my God.
-Yeah, man,

-when he sees these pictures.
-Guys, get together.

05:30.371 --> 05:31.706
Say "private jet."

G Five!

05:35.793 --> 05:36.753
Hey!

05:36.836 --> 05:37.837
This is insane!

05:38.463 --> 05:39.505
-Right?
-Hey.

05:39.589 --> 05:40.465
-Hello.
-Hi

05:40.548 --> 05:42.550
-Hi buddy, I'm so excited.
-Hello.

05:42.633 --> 05:43.801
-How are you?
-I'm good.

05:43.885 --> 05:45.345
I'm so glad you could make it.

05:45.428 --> 05:46.304
Oh, hey. Hey.

05:46.429 --> 05:48.723
-And thanks for having me, man!
-Of course!

05:48.848 --> 05:49.807
I can't wait.

-Charley.
-Charley.

05:51.184 --> 05:52.935
-Finding the Charley pad.
-Yeah, he is.

05:53.311 --> 05:54.395
Making memories.

05:54.604 --> 05:56.147
-Hey!
-Hi.

05:56.230 --> 05:57.190
Hi.

05:57.732 --> 05:59.359
The last hurrah!

06:00.485 --> 06:04.447
-Hello. Hello.
-Hello. Hello. Hello!

06:04.906 --> 06:05.823
-Hi.
-Hi.

06:06.115 --> 06:08.493
Aw, this is so exciting!

06:08.618 --> 06:10.953
Okay! Oh, my god. Alright.

06:11.037 --> 06:12.246
Looks like everybody's here?

06:12.330 --> 06:14.499
Yeah, let's find a seat. Buckle up.

06:16.000 --> 06:17.335
Guys, what do you mean, um...

06:18.294 --> 06:21.214
everyone's here? What about,
like my friends from work and, uh,

06:21.923 --> 06:22.965
like childhood?

06:23.174 --> 06:25.218
I sent you a list. I emailed you
a whole bunch of names.

06:25.301 --> 06:28.179
Don't look at me.
Marianne was in charge of the invites.

06:28.346 --> 06:31.349
Okay, I thought it'd be way more fun
to keep it small.

06:31.432 --> 06:33.142
You know, spend quality time together.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.520
Right, but I verbally invited
all these people.

06:35.603 --> 06:37.814
-Ah.
-My point, Nick, is that my best friend

06:37.897 --> 06:39.607
from first grade,
he was planning on coming.

06:39.690 --> 06:41.901
He blocked out the weekend.
He got a sitter.

06:42.527 --> 06:43.611
-That was too bad.
-Mm.

06:43.694 --> 06:45.029
Oh, well. You snooze you lose.

06:45.113 --> 06:46.531
But-- Nobody snoozed.

06:46.614 --> 06:47.532
You snoozed.

06:47.657 --> 06:48.825
-They just lost.
-Not really.

06:48.950 --> 06:51.035
No. He should've reached out.
He should've found out.

06:51.119 --> 06:52.161
You never invited him!

06:52.912 --> 06:55.123
I'm gonna be your captain today
and I'm gonna need you

06:55.206 --> 06:56.958
-to take your seats, please.
-Sure.

06:57.250 --> 06:58.334
Are you Max?

06:58.418 --> 06:59.252
Ah, yes.

06:59.752 --> 07:01.295
I'm going to have to ask you to...

07:01.671 --> 07:03.756
buckle in good and tight because this ride

07:03.965 --> 07:05.383
is about to get bumpy.

07:05.883 --> 07:07.718
[Max] Oh, God.

07:07.802 --> 07:08.636
Yeah!

07:08.803 --> 07:10.555
-Yes!
-Oh my god.

07:10.638 --> 07:11.931
Nick, are you serious?

07:12.682 --> 07:13.516
Damn it!

07:13.599 --> 07:15.268
No. God!

07:15.977 --> 07:19.897
I don't think that shirt
was the right size. I said no strippers!

07:20.022 --> 07:22.150
-You said no strip  clubs!
-I-- what?

07:22.233 --> 07:23.901
-Totally different.
-Oh my. Sir.

07:24.360 --> 07:28.614
Sir, what vibe am I giving off
that says "come close to me"?

07:28.698 --> 07:30.908
Please. Just please read my cues.

07:30.992 --> 07:32.702
I don't want to do this
anymore. Please stop.

07:32.785 --> 07:35.663
Please stop. Thank you. You've been
so nice, and your mustache is great.

07:35.746 --> 07:37.331
I just don't want you to be here anymore.

07:37.415 --> 07:38.875
-Hey.
-Hey.

07:39.250 --> 07:40.209
So, how did it go?

07:40.793 --> 07:41.627
Oh, with Sam?

07:41.711 --> 07:44.422
Um, you know what? I think...

07:44.839 --> 07:46.299
I think talking to her really helped.

07:46.549 --> 07:47.925
Thank you for making me do that.

07:48.009 --> 07:50.011
Yeah, we're both really grateful to you.

07:50.219 --> 07:51.971
You know? I know it's a little awkward,

07:52.054 --> 07:53.931
but I'm so glad that you guys are here.

07:54.390 --> 07:57.059
You know what?
It actually hasn't been that awkward.

07:57.143 --> 07:59.228
I'm having a really good time
with everyone.

07:59.604 --> 08:00.938
I never saw that coming.

08:02.315 --> 08:04.567
But, um, what is up with Sam?

08:06.027 --> 08:07.653
She's keeping a low profile.

08:07.987 --> 08:09.655
Well, that's just ridiculous.

08:09.739 --> 08:11.282
We should all have fun tonight.

08:11.365 --> 08:12.408
Um, excuse me.

08:13.075 --> 08:14.535
Can we get another round of drinks?

08:15.077 --> 08:16.120
-To Max.
-To Max.

08:16.204 --> 08:17.288
Yeah!

08:18.206 --> 08:19.040
You know what?

08:19.123 --> 08:20.666
-I could get used to this, Nick.
-Uh-huh.

08:20.833 --> 08:23.002
Okay, Nick. Tell us where we're going.

08:23.169 --> 08:24.837
-It's time, seriously.
-Please. Please, man.

08:24.921 --> 08:26.506
-Yeah.
-Wouldn't it be more fun

08:26.589 --> 08:28.257
-just to touch down and look around?
-Tell us.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.717
-We want to know.
-May-- maybe.

08:30.635 --> 08:31.594
Alright. Fine.

08:32.428 --> 08:33.679
I will spoil the surprise.

08:34.138 --> 08:35.389
We are going...

08:35.640 --> 08:39.060
to Atlantic City. What up?

08:41.521 --> 08:42.396
Atlantic City?

08:43.439 --> 08:44.273
New Jersey?

08:44.357 --> 08:46.859
-We're not really going to Atlantic City?
-Yeah.

08:47.068 --> 08:49.612
[shouts] Yeah, yeah, yeah. A. C., baby.

08:49.695 --> 08:52.365
-What's up?
-No. Boo!

08:52.490 --> 08:54.033
-Lame.
-That's the worst.

08:54.116 --> 08:54.992
-Boo!
-That sucks!

08:55.701 --> 08:57.328
What is wrong with A.C., baby?

08:57.411 --> 09:00.039
-That's old school.
-Old school doesn't make it good.

09:00.248 --> 09:01.958
You know what else is old school? Slavery.

09:02.083 --> 09:04.919
You don't take a private jet for a
15-minute flight.

09:05.044 --> 09:06.462
Yeah, we are.

09:06.629 --> 09:08.464
Old school!

09:08.923 --> 09:11.384
It doesn't make a difference
if it is old school. It's horrible.

09:11.467 --> 09:13.261
Why would you tell us
to bring bathing suits?

09:13.344 --> 09:14.595
-What was that all about?
-Dudes!

09:14.679 --> 09:15.513
Hot tubs.

09:15.596 --> 09:17.098
Oh. Gross.

09:17.181 --> 09:19.934
Nobody wants to get in an Atlantic City
hot tub.

09:20.017 --> 09:21.602
Aw, you say that sober.

09:21.686 --> 09:23.104
Atlantic City hot tubs?

09:23.437 --> 09:25.481
More like a yeast-infection broth.

09:25.690 --> 09:27.024
Am I right, ladies?

09:27.191 --> 09:28.442
-Marianne!
-Ooh, Marianne!

09:39.870 --> 09:40.955
Come on. How great is this?

09:41.080 --> 09:41.956
Yeah. Just uh--

09:42.206 --> 09:43.457
I don't love casinos.

09:43.666 --> 09:44.500
Really?

09:44.584 --> 09:45.543
I didn't know that.

09:46.043 --> 09:47.003
You could've asked.

09:47.670 --> 09:48.504
Not my style.

09:50.423 --> 09:52.216
Careful. We're being watched.

09:53.009 --> 09:54.343
Obviously. It's a casino.

09:54.760 --> 09:55.761
They're watching everyone.

09:56.137 --> 09:58.681
The two of us checking in together
isn't a great look.

09:58.764 --> 10:00.558
We're not checking in together.

10:00.641 --> 10:02.685
We're just standing next to each other
in a line...

10:03.227 --> 10:04.103
awkwardly.

10:04.270 --> 10:06.355
-And then we're gonna try--
-Just act normal,

10:06.439 --> 10:07.607
and nobody will be suspicious.

10:07.690 --> 10:08.691
Suspicious of what?

10:09.191 --> 10:10.610
We haven't had any contact.

10:11.068 --> 10:12.153
Except for that text.

10:13.613 --> 10:14.864
Which you didn't respond to.

10:15.781 --> 10:16.949
What would you want me to do?

10:17.033 --> 10:17.908
Send hearts?

10:19.869 --> 10:22.580
Maybe "thumbs up" or just...
you know, like a unicorn,

10:22.705 --> 10:25.541
or like, you know that-- an egg beater,
a pizza slice...

10:26.000 --> 10:27.251
-an emoji.
-Stop!

10:28.210 --> 10:29.128
Are you mad?

10:29.879 --> 10:30.838
No, I just...

10:31.422 --> 10:33.257
I don't want to get all this
started again.

10:33.341 --> 10:34.383
[Ethan sighs]

10:34.842 --> 10:35.718
One text?

10:36.135 --> 10:36.969
Like it's...

10:38.596 --> 10:40.014
It's like with cookies, right?

10:40.097 --> 10:42.183
You take one bite
and then you eat the whole box.

10:43.976 --> 10:45.061
[Ethan chuckles]

10:45.603 --> 10:46.729
[Ethan clears throat]

10:51.233 --> 10:52.109
What?

10:52.318 --> 10:53.235
Eating box.

10:55.196 --> 10:56.447
What are you, 14?

10:57.073 --> 10:57.990
Jesus.

10:59.116 --> 11:00.993
-Adults muff-dive.
-[Ethan laughs]

11:03.704 --> 11:04.622
Stop. Stop.

11:04.747 --> 11:06.999
Seriously, I'm not here
to have a good time. Okay?

11:07.083 --> 11:08.542
-Okay. Okay.
-Don't make me laugh.

11:08.626 --> 11:10.586
-You're the one who said "muff-dive".
-Please stop.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.880
All right. Meet back here in an hour.

11:13.005 --> 11:15.132
All right. I got another big surprise
on deck...

11:15.216 --> 11:17.426
Oh, is this a surprise that
we're going back to New York?

11:17.510 --> 11:18.928
That'd be the most amazing surprise.

11:19.011 --> 11:21.222
-That would be the best possible surprise,
-No one would see that coming.

11:21.305 --> 11:23.265
-That'd be a-- right?
-Nick, please.

11:23.349 --> 11:25.601
-Please can that  be the surprise?
-Where are we really staying?

11:25.685 --> 11:27.395
Oh, man, we're staying here for real.

11:38.614 --> 11:39.782
Classy!

11:40.324 --> 11:41.200
High-end.

11:41.283 --> 11:42.618
-Oh.
-This is amazing!

11:42.993 --> 11:44.745
-Yeah!
-So the theme is like a...

11:44.829 --> 11:45.788
This is classy.

11:45.871 --> 11:47.873
-Like a bachelorette party, right?
-Yeah.

11:47.957 --> 11:50.334
I don't know if it were offensive
or ironic. You pick.

11:50.584 --> 11:51.502
I like it, though.

11:51.961 --> 11:53.212
Attention, please.

11:53.337 --> 11:56.924
I would introduce you, but this man needs
no introduction.

11:57.007 --> 11:59.927
Uh... I think he absolutely does.

12:02.012 --> 12:03.139
Are you ser-- guys.

12:04.265 --> 12:05.349
It's David Beckham.

12:05.433 --> 12:06.600
[Charley laughs]

12:07.143 --> 12:08.060
Thank you.

12:08.936 --> 12:10.312
Hi, I'm David Beckham.

12:10.646 --> 12:13.232
I cannot wait to show you
my town, Atlantic City.

12:14.942 --> 12:16.318
I know who I'm fucking tonight.

12:16.819 --> 12:18.195
-Let's see the abs.
-Exciting.

12:19.363 --> 12:21.407
Thank you, guys.
It's very exciting to meet

12:21.490 --> 12:23.492
the fake version of someone that I...

12:23.576 --> 12:25.286
literally have never once
thought about.

12:25.369 --> 12:26.620
Come on. Really,

12:26.704 --> 12:30.124
-Why would I--
-Because he's a huge gay icon.

12:30.833 --> 12:32.042
-Is he?
-Yes!

12:32.126 --> 12:33.544
Big time. Tell him.

12:34.378 --> 12:37.006
Yeah, I have a massive
homosexual following.

12:37.089 --> 12:38.382
[all] Oh!

12:38.549 --> 12:39.967
-Now, it's true.
-I stand corrected.

12:40.134 --> 12:41.469
He said it, so that makes it real.

12:41.552 --> 12:42.595
-He told me.
-He said it.

12:42.678 --> 12:44.555
-And now-- Yes.
-The fake version of him said it.

12:44.722 --> 12:46.182
So, now, it's true. You're right.

12:46.390 --> 12:47.224
-That's my bad.
-So--

12:47.349 --> 12:48.476
In your-- in your face.

12:48.726 --> 12:49.977
Oh, man. Guys.

12:50.060 --> 12:52.396
Felix is doing a private tour
of the MET right now.

12:52.480 --> 12:53.314
Who cares?

12:53.397 --> 12:55.357
That sounds lovely.

12:55.941 --> 12:57.568
Do museums have this?

12:57.651 --> 12:58.819
-I mean, come on.
-[Ethan] Yeah.

12:58.903 --> 13:01.238
-Do they have these Max?
-They do not.

13:01.322 --> 13:02.823
Look at this stuff.

13:03.741 --> 13:05.451
Here.   Put the wig on.

13:06.744 --> 13:07.912
Oh my God, guys.

13:08.037 --> 13:10.080
We have David Beckham, and now we have

13:10.247 --> 13:11.957
Victoria Beckham.

13:12.208 --> 13:13.375
-Posh.
-[Ethan] That's amazing!

13:13.459 --> 13:14.460
-[Nick] Wow.
-[Marianne] Oh my God.

13:14.543 --> 13:16.003
[Ethan] No, it looks real. It's good.

13:16.086 --> 13:17.421
-That's it.
-Look at that. That's it.

13:17.505 --> 13:19.256
-Oh my God.
-Unbelievable.

13:19.340 --> 13:20.382
[Ethan] Sam, it's amazing.

13:20.466 --> 13:21.509
Hello, America.

13:22.259 --> 13:23.761
Hello Atlantic City.

13:23.844 --> 13:25.846
[Max] Oh my Gosh.

13:25.930 --> 13:27.097
-[Nick] That was really good.
-[Ethan] Perfect.

13:27.598 --> 13:28.474
Thank you.

13:28.557 --> 13:29.767
[all] Oh!

13:29.850 --> 13:30.684
Look at her.

13:33.896 --> 13:35.147
[Lisa] Ah, I got the tip.

13:35.231 --> 13:36.732
My turn. Hold on, wait a minute.

13:36.816 --> 13:37.983
Oh, what a shot!

13:38.067 --> 13:39.485
[Sam] Yes! Are you having fun?

13:41.237 --> 13:42.988
This is really nice dinner, guys.

13:43.072 --> 13:44.740
[all] Yeah!

13:45.407 --> 13:46.575
What do you recommend?

13:46.659 --> 13:48.786
The New York strip is very popular.

13:49.286 --> 13:50.538
Okay, I'll have that.

13:50.621 --> 13:51.747
Rare, please. Thank you.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.458
Um, we're actually
out of the New York strip tonight.

13:54.542 --> 13:56.836
Instead, may I offer you
the New Jersey Strip?

13:57.461 --> 13:58.462
Oh, what's that?

13:59.088 --> 14:01.465
No! Dammit!

14:01.590 --> 14:03.592
I walked right into that shit.

14:04.260 --> 14:06.428
Are you serious? Come on, man.

14:06.512 --> 14:08.013
I said "no strippers", Nick.

14:08.097 --> 14:09.014
No strippers!

14:09.098 --> 14:12.059
-Sorry, I forgot about this one.
-You think! this is the second stripper!

14:12.142 --> 14:13.018
Okay, I forgot!

14:13.102 --> 14:14.979
Oh, would you please turn off the music?

14:15.437 --> 14:16.605
This is bumming me out.

14:16.689 --> 14:18.065
You want me to take my bum out?

14:18.190 --> 14:19.149
You know what I meant.

14:19.233 --> 14:21.485
Please. No-- the music is over.

14:21.652 --> 14:22.736
Come on, man.

14:22.820 --> 14:25.114
-Alright.
-Oh, my gosh.

14:25.197 --> 14:27.533
Oh, don't take it personally, Tony.

14:27.616 --> 14:28.701
Your ass is ripped.

14:29.743 --> 14:31.412
-I know.
-Oh, he knows.

14:31.495 --> 14:32.538
All right, I'm stuffed.

14:32.621 --> 14:34.707
I have never had so much meat.

14:36.208 --> 14:37.209
Really, I mean--

14:37.293 --> 14:38.919
-Don't be gross.
-I don't know how or where

14:39.003 --> 14:39.837
to start with that.

14:39.920 --> 14:42.172
-I'm very full with meat I'm saying.
-In the Atlantic strip.

14:42.256 --> 14:45.593
-[Nick] It's never happened before?
-Can I ask you. Are you Victoria Beckham?

14:45.676 --> 14:47.011
Yes, it is. And that's David Beckham.

14:47.136 --> 14:48.137
I told you it was them!

14:48.345 --> 14:50.180
I am David Beckham. That is me.

14:50.764 --> 14:52.057
See. I told you.

14:53.058 --> 14:54.184
Huge gay icon.

14:54.935 --> 14:56.437
Can we take a photo with both of you?

14:56.520 --> 14:57.479
Please, if we could.

14:57.563 --> 14:59.273
-Come on, do it, Posh!
-Come on, Victoria.

14:59.356 --> 15:01.358
-Okay. Sure.
-It'll be so fast.

15:01.442 --> 15:02.359
Thank you.

15:02.443 --> 15:03.777
Get over here, fancy boy.

15:03.861 --> 15:05.988
Oh, no, no, no. I think you guys
have it covered.

15:06.071 --> 15:07.907
-No, no, no. You have to.
-You want him in.

15:07.990 --> 15:09.241
You really need this guy.

15:09.325 --> 15:11.327
-This is our manager.
-Oh, your- oh, wow.

15:11.410 --> 15:14.663
That's right, Manager.
Nigel McCartney. No relation.

15:14.747 --> 15:16.081
-Wow.
-Hello, Nigel.

15:16.165 --> 15:17.124
-Hi.
-That's right.

15:17.291 --> 15:19.418
So I guess Nigel's Australian.

15:19.585 --> 15:21.837
What a ride it has been, aye, Vic.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.923
[all laugh]

15:24.048 --> 15:25.841
-Amazing! Amazing.
-Can you take our picture?

15:26.008 --> 15:26.884
I'm freaking out.

15:26.967 --> 15:27.885
Thank you so much.

15:29.678 --> 15:31.221
-Okay.
-Everyone, do Posh face.

15:34.892 --> 15:37.645
-Alright. There you go.
-One more where I kiss the Mrs.?

15:37.728 --> 15:38.562
No.

15:42.358 --> 15:43.776
Okay, look. Posh, over here.

15:43.901 --> 15:46.528
-You're my queen, Posh!
-Yes. You guys are King and Queen.

15:46.612 --> 15:47.446
This is ridiculous.

15:47.529 --> 15:49.782
-They don't even look like them.
-Who cares? This is fun.

15:49.865 --> 15:50.991
We love you, Posh!

15:51.909 --> 15:53.619
[Lisa] Why are you encouraging her?

15:54.453 --> 15:56.205
What? I thought you wanted her
to have fun.

15:56.288 --> 15:57.164
Yeah, within reason.

15:57.247 --> 15:59.124
She's having the best night
of fucking life.

15:59.208 --> 16:01.460
-Posh, over here.
-Over here. Look down.

16:01.543 --> 16:03.087
-Okay.
-Peace sign. Girl power.

16:03.170 --> 16:05.631
-Yeah, peace it.
-Hello, hello. It's me,

16:05.714 --> 16:07.007
Baby Spice.

16:07.758 --> 16:09.760
Let's kick this party into high gear.

16:09.843 --> 16:13.555
Woo! A-zig-a-zig-ah!

16:14.098 --> 16:16.600
A-zig-a-zig-ah!

16:17.226 --> 16:18.102
Oh, look,

16:18.936 --> 16:21.355
it's my favorite bird, Baby Spice.

16:21.438 --> 16:22.398
You're not Baby Spice.

16:22.523 --> 16:24.942
-You don't have bangs.
-Okay, well, guess what?

16:25.234 --> 16:29.405
Posh was already taken, even though
I clearly look more like her. So--

16:29.488 --> 16:30.406
Oh, I mean-- look,

16:30.531 --> 16:32.866
you can totally be Posh.

16:32.950 --> 16:34.576
I don't want to be Posh.

16:34.702 --> 16:36.161
-I'm Baby Spice.
-Hold up.

16:37.121 --> 16:37.997
Two Poshes.

16:38.414 --> 16:39.289
I like that idea.

16:41.583 --> 16:42.960
You know what? This is so dumb.

16:43.168 --> 16:44.545
This is so dumb.

16:44.628 --> 16:46.588
I mean, who gives a shit
about the Spice Girls anyway.

16:46.672 --> 16:48.090
This is-- let's do something fun.

16:48.257 --> 16:50.300
Okay? Come on, Beckham.
Let's do something fun.

16:50.384 --> 16:51.885
Come on. Come on, Charley.

16:52.011 --> 16:53.971
[Charley] What are we doing?
Are we gonna do something fun.

16:54.054 --> 16:56.181
-Guys, what are we doing?
-You almost won that elephant.

16:56.265 --> 16:57.808
-That was fun.
-[Lisa] Guys.

16:57.891 --> 17:00.561
Oh my God. We should totally do that.
That looks like so much fun.

17:00.644 --> 17:01.937
I don't know.

17:02.062 --> 17:04.231
-I just ate like a ton of steaks.
-I get really car sick.

17:04.314 --> 17:06.942
I wish I could, but I'm not going to...

17:07.026 --> 17:08.444
-under any circumstances.
-Oh, come on.

17:08.527 --> 17:10.696
-Charley and I are going to do it.
-Yeah.

17:11.488 --> 17:12.364
Oh, re-- okay.

17:12.448 --> 17:13.866
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Come on. It'll be fun.

17:13.949 --> 17:14.992
-Yep.
-Oh, God.

17:15.075 --> 17:15.909
Oh man.

17:16.076 --> 17:18.412
[rock music plays]

17:19.163 --> 17:20.205
This is the worst part.

17:20.289 --> 17:22.416
because we're just waiting for it
to happen.

17:27.171 --> 17:28.505
[both scream]

17:30.049 --> 17:31.216
[Lisa laughs]

17:32.342 --> 17:33.177
Oh my God.

17:51.361 --> 17:53.197
You did it, babe. [chuckles]

17:53.322 --> 17:54.156
See.

17:54.323 --> 17:55.991
-I knew you had it in you.
-Oh, my God.

17:56.075 --> 17:57.826
Easy. Easy.

17:58.410 --> 17:59.369
What were you afraid of?

17:59.453 --> 18:00.454
-Scary.
-No!

18:01.830 --> 18:03.957
Oh, look,
You just get this beautiful view.

18:04.041 --> 18:04.917
Oh my God.

18:05.626 --> 18:06.668
Oh my God!

18:07.669 --> 18:09.088
-Oh, my God.
-Oh, my God.

18:09.338 --> 18:10.297
[both scream]

18:10.422 --> 18:11.298
[Lisa] Oh, shoot.

18:12.549 --> 18:13.842
Charley, are you okay?

18:13.926 --> 18:16.095
You want like a-- like a Ginger Ale or...

18:16.512 --> 18:17.346
MRI?

18:18.138 --> 18:21.642
I had no idea that you were out cold
the entire time. Are you okay?

18:21.725 --> 18:23.685
I'm fine. I'm fine.
Must've been like the...

18:23.894 --> 18:26.688
you know, the positive and negative
G forces, one right after the other?

18:26.855 --> 18:28.565
-I feel great now though, guys.
-No. Totally.

18:28.649 --> 18:30.651
Just to make sure though.
Who's the President?

18:31.026 --> 18:32.111
[all laugh]

18:32.778 --> 18:34.780
[Charley laughs sarcastically]

18:34.863 --> 18:38.075
Oh, involuntary physical reactions
are hilarious, guys.

18:38.200 --> 18:40.536
I really like having a
traumatic experience,

18:40.619 --> 18:42.412
and having you guys all mock me
to my face.

18:42.496 --> 18:44.039
Thanks guys. You're the best.

18:44.123 --> 18:45.249
Come on, Lisa. Let's go.

18:46.458 --> 18:47.876
-[Ethan] Whoa!
-Oh my God, Charley!

18:47.960 --> 18:49.336
-No, no.
-Yeah!

18:50.254 --> 18:51.088
-Oh, shit!
-[all cheer]

18:51.171 --> 18:52.256
Oh, shit!

18:52.464 --> 18:54.133
[Max] Charley, that was amazing!

18:54.675 --> 18:55.843
[Ethan] Okay, well played.

18:55.926 --> 18:57.594
Bravo. Bravo. That was good.

18:58.512 --> 18:59.930
[dealer] Seven out. Right away.

19:00.472 --> 19:02.683
-I just lost so much money so fast, guys,
-In the line.

19:02.766 --> 19:03.642
I hate casinos.

19:03.767 --> 19:05.394
-This is a disaster.
-Here.

19:05.519 --> 19:06.728
Honestly, no more gambling.

19:06.854 --> 19:08.480
-I can't do it.
-[dealer] Let's come get some.

19:08.647 --> 19:11.024
Here. Here. Come on, ta-- take it.
Put it on the pass line.

19:11.108 --> 19:12.276
No, I don't want your money.

19:12.359 --> 19:14.111
-I don't want your money, Nick.
-No, take it.

19:14.194 --> 19:15.362
He's trying to apologize.

19:15.445 --> 19:16.446
Look.

19:16.530 --> 19:18.407
I just thought it would be fun
to lowbrow it.

19:18.490 --> 19:19.700
Your next bachelor party...

19:19.867 --> 19:21.201
like way classier.

19:21.451 --> 19:22.286
I promise.

19:22.578 --> 19:23.662
Come on, come on.

19:23.954 --> 19:24.872
[dealer] Sir, they're your dice.

19:24.955 --> 19:27.833
Yeah, well, I can't-- I can't
roll the dice. I'm like ice cold.

19:27.958 --> 19:30.544
But this is your party. You should--
you should-- you should roll.

19:30.711 --> 19:32.754
-Sam, would you do it for me, please?
-Are you sure?

19:32.880 --> 19:34.965
Yeah, why I mean, I'd rather have Posh

19:35.048 --> 19:36.258
-take over my bet.
-Oh-oh. Posh.

19:36.341 --> 19:37.342
-Posh.
-Let's do it Posh.

19:37.426 --> 19:39.845
Posh, Posh.

19:39.928 --> 19:41.930
Posh, Posh.

19:42.014 --> 19:44.558
All right. Maybe we got to spice...

19:45.058 --> 19:46.268
it up.

19:46.351 --> 19:47.978
-Yeah.
-Yes.

19:48.061 --> 19:48.896
Blow me, Beckham.

19:49.229 --> 19:51.315
Here we go. Okay.

19:53.025 --> 19:54.318
-[dealer] Seven. Winner's Circle.
-Yes!

19:54.484 --> 19:55.319
Made it.

19:55.444 --> 19:56.653
I didn't lose my money.

19:56.737 --> 19:58.363
I'm getting more money?

19:58.447 --> 19:59.907
-There you go.
-I'm getting more money!

20:02.075 --> 20:03.327
Blow me, Becksy.

20:05.746 --> 20:06.997
[all cheer]

20:07.998 --> 20:09.791
-Everybody ready?
-Yes.

20:09.875 --> 20:12.753
-Yes!
-[all] Spice it up!

20:16.673 --> 20:18.675
[all cheer]

20:19.384 --> 20:21.386
Oh, my god!

20:22.387 --> 20:24.514
We're gonna roll again, I guess!

20:27.601 --> 20:28.435
[dealer] Winner!

20:29.102 --> 20:30.187
Wait.

20:30.312 --> 20:31.688
-No way!
-Yes!

20:34.816 --> 20:36.818
[Ethan] Go. Go. Go! Go Right. Go.

20:36.902 --> 20:39.529
We've got to spice it up!

20:40.113 --> 20:41.573
-Can you blow me, Becksy.
-Pack it up!

20:41.657 --> 20:43.909
-Oh, shit.
-Give me. Let it-- let!

20:44.493 --> 20:45.661
-Why did she do that?
-My god.

20:46.912 --> 20:48.288
Made it rain. Making it rain.

20:50.624 --> 20:51.500
Nice form there.

20:53.252 --> 20:54.253
I'll-- I'll get 'em.

20:54.336 --> 20:55.170
I'll get  'em!

20:57.047 --> 20:59.049
Wow, why did you do that?

21:00.050 --> 21:01.343
Thank God you're here.

21:02.135 --> 21:03.303
Some lady threw dice.

21:04.429 --> 21:05.847
I think she, um...

21:07.933 --> 21:09.268
-she's went that way.
-That way.

21:09.768 --> 21:10.602
Either way.

21:10.686 --> 21:12.271
Okay, I'm going. I'm going.

21:12.354 --> 21:13.355
Get you out of here.

21:13.438 --> 21:14.606
Don't-- you can't touch me.

21:14.690 --> 21:16.483
You're not allowed to touch--
Stop. I got you.

21:16.566 --> 21:18.026
-Jesus Christ.
-Sorry. We're sorry.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.570
-Lis. Hey. Hey. Lis.
-You messed with the wrong lawyer, sir.

21:21.947 --> 21:25.117
It's been a long night, you know.
Maybe we should just go back to the room.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.910
I don't want to go back to the room,
Charley,

21:26.994 --> 21:28.662
I want to keep having fun with my friends.

21:29.121 --> 21:30.747
I kind of think that ship has sailed.

21:30.831 --> 21:31.873
At least for tonight.

21:32.082 --> 21:34.584
No, Charley, I don't want to go back
to the room, Okay?

21:35.544 --> 21:36.878
Just because she steals my husband

21:36.962 --> 21:39.256
doesn't mean she gets to steal my
friends, too.

21:39.840 --> 21:41.883
Okay. I don't think that's
what's happening here.

21:47.222 --> 21:48.056
Hey guys.

21:48.432 --> 21:49.266
Hey.

21:50.559 --> 21:52.436
I'm sorry. I don't know what happened.

21:52.561 --> 21:54.855
I know this is Max's night.
And I...

21:55.689 --> 21:56.690
I don't want to ruin it.

21:58.066 --> 21:59.860
It's okay, Baby Spice.

22:01.403 --> 22:02.612
I can't help it.

22:03.071 --> 22:04.740
I'm just a baby, you know.

22:04.823 --> 22:06.533
-No, no, no, everyone...
-You're just a baby.

22:06.700 --> 22:08.493
-Everyone loves you, Baby Spice.
-Totally fine.

22:08.577 --> 22:09.494
Just a wee little baby.

22:09.578 --> 22:12.080
Your brain is not developed yet.
You don't know any better.

22:12.664 --> 22:14.833
Guys! $6,800!

22:15.459 --> 22:17.961
We can get a lot of salt water taffy
with this money.

22:18.253 --> 22:19.296
-Do you see this?
-Yeah!

22:19.379 --> 22:20.213
We did good.

22:20.297 --> 22:21.882
-Is that what you want?
-Taffy, guys.

22:21.965 --> 22:23.050
I want all the taffy!

22:23.133 --> 22:25.135
Uh! Oh!

22:25.218 --> 22:26.720
The banana flavor is gross.

22:26.970 --> 22:28.305
I'll have it. They're my favorite.

22:28.388 --> 22:30.307
-Here you go.
-Oh!

22:30.390 --> 22:31.308
-Hey.
-Hey.

22:31.933 --> 22:32.768
Hey.

22:34.936 --> 22:35.771
You know what?

22:37.230 --> 22:38.607
When you're facing this way,

22:39.024 --> 22:41.234
Atlantic City is kind of pretty.

22:44.946 --> 22:45.822
Felix...

22:47.532 --> 22:49.951
I bet Felix went to bed before midnight.

22:52.120 --> 22:53.080
This is nice, guys.

22:53.997 --> 22:55.248
Thank you.

22:56.541 --> 23:00.003
Ooh, I think I see a used condom.
Right there in front of you, Nick.

23:01.421 --> 23:03.382
Sex on the beach! So romantic.

23:05.175 --> 23:06.009
Oh, god.

23:07.135 --> 23:09.388
I think I just swallowed a filling
with my taffy.

23:12.516 --> 23:13.350
Charley.

23:15.352 --> 23:17.396
-Should he be sleeping?
-Yeah, let him sleep that off.

23:17.687 --> 23:19.815
The best thing you can do
for a concussion.

23:19.940 --> 23:21.858
-I don't-- I don't think so.
-Yeah.

23:21.942 --> 23:24.319
-I think you're not supposed to sleep?
-No, it's good for you.

23:25.028 --> 23:26.488
It's okay. Charley.

23:27.406 --> 23:29.282
Hey Lisa's boyfriend, wake up.

23:39.960 --> 23:40.877
-Hey.
-Hey.

23:41.753 --> 23:43.088
I was just seeing how you're doing.

23:44.714 --> 23:45.549
Uh-huh.

23:46.091 --> 23:47.676
No, seriously,
I'm just checking up on you.

23:47.759 --> 23:48.760
I'm fine.

23:49.219 --> 23:51.096
-Good.
-More tired than anything.

23:51.346 --> 23:52.389
Cool. Okay.

23:52.597 --> 23:55.559
Lisa... obviously has some
unresolved anger towards...

23:56.143 --> 23:57.018
Victoria Beckham.

23:58.228 --> 24:00.230
[Ethan chuckles]

24:01.648 --> 24:03.859
Well, you did make
a pretty hot Mrs. Beckham.

24:04.234 --> 24:06.903
Well, you've got a thing
for married women.

24:07.654 --> 24:08.488
Not anymore.

24:11.450 --> 24:12.451
Goodnight.

25:46.920 --> 25:48.922
