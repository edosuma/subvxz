high-energy particles...

were halted after that.

11:58.009 --> 11:59.676
Yes, that's him.

11:59.844 --> 12:03.055
Can you tell us
how you handled
your father's absence?

12:04.891 --> 12:06.392
Well...

12:09.479 --> 12:11.688
My mother was
certainly distressed by it.

12:11.773 --> 12:13.816

at the time.

12:14.317 --> 12:17.361
But he was,
uh, committed to his job...

12:17.529 --> 12:19.655
and I'm sure it was very
difficult for him as well.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.116
STROUD: Roy...

12:22.826 --> 12:26.829
we have something that might
come as quite a shock to you.

12:29.624 --> 12:33.710
We believe your father
is still alive near Neptune.

12:33.878 --> 12:35.421
Where exactly, we do not know.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.131

numerous drones,

12:37.215 --> 12:39.550

it's a vast area to cover.

12:45.807 --> 12:48.600

12:48.977 --> 12:50.519
We believe so.

12:51.312 --> 12:53.605
STROUD: Roy, The Surge
seems to be the result

12:53.690 --> 12:56.024
of some kind
of anti-matter reaction.

12:56.693 --> 12:59.278
Now, the Lima Project was
powered by that material...

12:59.446 --> 13:01.321
and your father
was in charge of it.

13:02.031 --> 13:03.031
Now, we're talking about

13:03.116 --> 13:06.076
a potentially unstoppable
chain reaction here.

13:06.995 --> 13:09.163
The uncontrolled release
of anti-matter...

13:09.247 --> 13:10.622
could ultimately threaten

13:10.707 --> 13:13.459
the stability of
our entire solar system.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.712
All life could be destroyed.

13:18.173 --> 13:21.008
Major, we would like you to send

13:21.092 --> 13:23.969
a personal message on Mars
by secure laser...

13:24.053 --> 13:27.389
to what we hope
is the Lima Project.

13:27.724 --> 13:28.765
The text of your message

13:28.850 --> 13:31.059
would be prepared in advance,
of course.

13:31.227 --> 13:33.729
Mars, sir?
I'm going to Mars?

13:34.355 --> 13:37.774
It is the last secure hub
we have.

13:39.235 --> 13:41.695
STROUD: Roy,
we need to find out

13:41.779 --> 13:43.906
just what we're up against here.

13:44.073 --> 13:45.532
Our underground Mars base

13:45.617 --> 13:49.286
was the only one
unaffected by The Surge.

13:49.454 --> 13:51.163
And we believe a personal plea,

13:51.247 --> 13:54.416
from you to your father,
might elicit a response.

13:54.584 --> 13:56.335
We can track that signal...

13:56.503 --> 14:00.088
locate him and figure out
a way to stop this.

14:00.256 --> 14:05.761
What is happening out there is
a crisis of unknown magnitude.

14:05.929 --> 14:09.014
Now, we're counting on you
to help us find him.

14:09.182 --> 14:11.016
Are you with us?

14:14.437 --> 14:16.271

on the Far Side.

on a need-to-know basis.

14:23.196 --> 14:24.196

of the threat...

formulated to avoid all panic.

commercially to the moon

14:32.664 --> 14:33.872

Colonel Pruitt will be your
point person from here on.

14:36.626 --> 14:39.711
Absolute top secrecy
must be maintained.

14:40.588 --> 14:42.256
ROY: "Are you with us?"

14:44.342 --> 14:45.968
Like I have a choice.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.806
My dad was a pioneer.

14:50.974 --> 14:54.017
He sacrificed himself
for the search
for intelligent life.

14:55.520 --> 14:57.396
My dad was the program.

14:59.315 --> 15:02.234
I was 16 when he left,
29 when he disappeared.

15:12.287 --> 15:15.163
I'm coming at you
from the Lima Project.

15:15.331 --> 15:18.792
Just on our way past Jupiter
and ultimately on to Neptune.

15:19.294 --> 15:21.336

15:21.421 --> 15:24.214
that we have excited
real and enormous interest...

15:24.299 --> 15:27.843
around the world,
and we are grateful for it.

15:28.303 --> 15:30.470
We're doing big things
up here, real big.

15:31.681 --> 15:34.933
Namely, we're about to answer
the number one question...

15:35.101 --> 15:38.520
when do we find
all the intelligent life
out there?

15:38.688 --> 15:40.105
And we know we will.

15:40.607 --> 15:42.566
We're going to the edge
of the heliosphere...

15:42.734 --> 15:44.276
where the sun's magnetic field

15:44.360 --> 15:46.987
won't affect
our instruments one bit.

15:47.155 --> 15:51.241
We'll be able to examine

I've seen that rage
in my father...

47:09.619 --> 47:11.995

He left us.

47:21.506 --> 47:23.715
You know...

47:24.634 --> 47:25.884

all I see is hurt.

47:34.352 --> 47:38.563
I just see pain.

it keeps me walled off...

walled off from relationships...

with equal severity.

01:49:34.777 --> 01:49:35.777
Thank you.

01:49:35.945 --> 01:49:37.570
MAN 2: K-R-5 on the 4-2.

01:49:37.655 --> 01:49:38.738
MAN 1: Good copy, flight.

01:49:38.822 --> 01:49:40.323
We're ready to go.

01:49:51.210 --> 01:49:53.461
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

01:50:22.950 --> 01:50:24.075
(THUDS)

01:50:24.159 --> 01:50:25.493
(INDISTINCT CHATTER ON RADIO)

01:50:25.577 --> 01:50:27.078
(ENGINE POWERS DOWN)

01:50:27.162 --> 01:50:28.162
MAN: Coming in, clean.

01:50:28.455 --> 01:50:30.290
Copy that. Thanks.

01:50:31.417 --> 01:50:34.168
One ready to go.
Data is good.

01:50:34.336 --> 01:50:36.296
We have all good. All good.

01:51:14.335 --> 01:51:16.044
You're all right, Major.

01:51:35.564 --> 01:51:39.359
ROY: I'm steady, calm.

01:51:40.361 --> 01:51:43.112
I slept well. No bad dreams.

01:51:45.616 --> 01:51:48.826
I am active and engaged.

01:51:52.581 --> 01:51:53.998
I'm aware of my surroundings

01:51:54.083 --> 01:51:56.501
and those
in my immediate sphere.

01:51:58.212 --> 01:51:59.712
I'm attentive.

01:52:04.009 --> 01:52:05.718
I'm focused on the essential...

01:52:05.886 --> 01:52:08.221
to the exclusion of all else.

01:52:24.988 --> 01:52:27.907
I'm unsure of the future...

01:52:28.075 --> 01:52:29.575
but I'm not concerned.

01:52:35.124 --> 01:52:38.000
I will rely
on those closest to me.

01:52:42.631 --> 01:52:44.841
And I will share
their burdens...

01:52:53.308 --> 01:52:54.976
as they share mine.

01:53:00.315 --> 01:53:01.649
I will live...

01:53:03.193 --> 01:53:04.986
and love.

01:53:11.910 --> 01:53:13.161
Submit.
