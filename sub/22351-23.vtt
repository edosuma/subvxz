00:02.999 --> 00:03.999
Julie: Tonight, it's double
eviction night.

00:04.000 --> 00:06.998
Survive, and you are two steps
closer to winning the half

00:06.999 --> 00:07.999
million dollar grand prize.

00:08.000 --> 00:10.998
The craziest night of the summer
starts right now.

00:10.999 --> 00:13.541
Welcome to "big brother."

00:13.542 --> 00:21.542
( Cheers and applause )
>> Previously on "big brother":

00:21.999 --> 00:25.416
With Becky control the house...
>> Congratulations, Becky.

00:25.417 --> 00:27.998
You are the new head of
household.

00:27.999 --> 00:33.998
She got Meg, Jackie, and
James all aboard to take out a

00:33.999 --> 00:34.000
big target.

00:34.000 --> 00:37.998
We're going to put up shelli
and Steve but it's going to be

00:37.999 --> 00:38.125
Vanessa.

00:38.126 --> 00:41.291
After telling shelli she was
just a pawn...

00:41.292 --> 00:43.998
We want Vanessa out bad.

00:43.999 --> 00:46.998
Becky set the stage for a
backdoor plan.

00:46.999 --> 00:50.998
I've nominated you, shelli,
and you, Steve.

00:50.999 --> 00:52.998
Knowing Vanessa was the true
target...

00:52.999 --> 00:54.999
Vanessa's the backdoor?

00:55.000 --> 00:57.998
That's plan.

00:57.999 --> 01:05.999
Steve left torn between
his two allies and a super power

01:06.999 --> 01:09.958
veto competition, the engineer
took down his rivals.

01:09.959 --> 01:15.708
Steve, you have won the
golden power of veto.

01:15.709 --> 01:17.998
After a conversation with
Becky...

01:17.999 --> 01:19.998
You're sieg I'm not going up?

01:19.999 --> 01:21.416
No.

01:21.417 --> 01:22.998
Vanessa felt sure she was
safe.

01:22.999 --> 01:25.998
The good news is I'm going to
be here another week!

01:25.999 --> 01:26.999
But at the veto meeting.

01:27.000 --> 01:31.998
I have decided to use the
power of veto on myself.

01:31.999 --> 01:34.998
The poker player was dealt
a bad hand.

01:34.999 --> 01:36.998
Vanessa, please take a seat.

01:36.999 --> 01:39.998
Tonight, which 6th sense
member will walk out the door,

01:39.999 --> 01:40.999
Vanessa or shelli?

01:41.000 --> 01:43.998
Plus a second houseguest is
leaving because it's double

01:43.999 --> 01:45.999
eviction night, baby.

01:46.000 --> 01:49.998
All this live on "big brother."

01:49.999 --> 01:53.708
Oh, my god!

01:53.709 --> 01:56.709
Yeah!

02:29.999 --> 02:37.999
( Cheers and applause )
>> Julie: Good evening.

02:38.999 --> 02:39.999
I'm Julie chen.

02:40.000 --> 02:41.998
Welcome to double eviction
night.

02:41.999 --> 02:46.998
It's been a summer of blindsides
and backdoors, but nothing could

02:46.999 --> 02:49.998
propose the houseguests for what
is about to happen.

02:49.999 --> 02:54.998
Tonight, the game goes into
overdrive as we play a week's

02:54.999 --> 02:56.998
worth of "big brother" in just
one night.

02:56.999 --> 03:00.998
And the two houseguests evicted
tonight will become the first to

03:00.999 --> 03:02.998
members of the jury.

03:02.999 --> 03:05.998
So who's headed to the jury
house?

03:05.999 --> 03:07.998
We'll find out before the hour
is up.

03:07.999 --> 03:12.998
But first, they dominated the
game for most of the summer, but

03:12.999 --> 03:16.998
now, the 6th sense alliance is
crumbling.

03:16.999 --> 03:24.999
Tonight, they will be forced to
say good-bye to another member.

03:29.999 --> 03:30.417
Okey-dokey.

03:30.418 --> 03:33.998
Here I am, I'm on the block
against my closest friend in the

03:33.999 --> 03:34.000
house.

03:34.000 --> 03:36.998
It's difficult because now our
interests are opposed, and only

03:36.999 --> 03:41.998
one of cuss stay.

03:41.999 --> 03:46.998
Becky has told me that I'm
safe, so I feel okay in this

03:46.999 --> 03:47.000
moment.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.958
My best-case scenario is to lay
low, and that's all I plan to

03:50.959 --> 03:55.416
do.

03:55.417 --> 03:59.998
Well, another week and
another two 6th sense alliance

03:59.999 --> 04:00.999
members are on the block.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.998
Obviously, I'm closer to Vanessa
than shelli but this was a total

04:03.999 --> 04:06.998
blindside and I'm not sure she
has enough votes to stay this

04:06.999 --> 04:10.998
week.

04:10.999 --> 04:13.416
My goal is to get Vanessa out
this week.

04:13.417 --> 04:17.998
Eight people will be voting, so
I only need James, Jackie, Meg,

04:17.999 --> 04:18.709
and John.

04:18.710 --> 04:20.833
I break the tie, she goes home.

04:20.834 --> 04:28.834
But I'm not putting anything
past Vanessa.

04:29.999 --> 04:32.999
I'm hurt and confused about
the things Becky said when she

04:33.000 --> 04:34.833
put me up on the block.

04:34.834 --> 04:37.998
A bunch of us made a deal last
week before Clay went home.

04:37.999 --> 04:38.999
I'll make a deal.

04:39.000 --> 04:41.998
I'm willing to say we don't put
any of each other on the block.

04:41.999 --> 04:44.833
I will give you my word none of
you are going on the block.

04:44.834 --> 04:45.998
You can give me your word?

04:45.999 --> 04:46.999
Absolutely.

04:47.000 --> 04:50.416
And you give me your word?

04:50.417 --> 04:57.998
And Becky broke that deal, and I
need some answers.

04:57.999 --> 04:58.000
Yo.

04:58.000 --> 05:00.998
Those were some pretty harsh
words, especially for someone

05:00.999 --> 05:01.999
like me.

05:02.000 --> 05:05.541
So I would love it if you could
explain them.

05:05.542 --> 05:07.998
So we all made a deal in a
group.

05:07.999 --> 05:13.124
You sat me in a room and
pointed your finger at me and

05:13.125 --> 05:16.291
said, "I do have your word?"
I felt like my word was bees

05:16.292 --> 05:17.998
forced from me, not given.

05:17.999 --> 05:18.000
I was pissed.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.998
It wasn't my idea, this whole
thing.

05:20.999 --> 05:22.291
You know what?

05:22.292 --> 05:23.998
I'm going to end it here.

05:23.999 --> 05:26.998
It just eye don't understand
why you're being so venomous

05:26.999 --> 05:27.999
with me.

05:28.000 --> 05:29.124
I'm the one on the block.

05:29.125 --> 05:31.998
I just don't feel like
explaining.

05:31.999 --> 05:32.999
You're a cold-hearted person.

05:32.999 --> 05:33.999
You really are.

05:34.000 --> 05:36.998
I just don't understand.

05:36.999 --> 05:42.999
Whoa!

05:44.999 --> 05:45.999
Yeah, of course.

05:46.000 --> 05:49.708
I'm not doing this all day.

05:49.709 --> 05:51.998
I have your vote, right?

05:51.999 --> 05:54.998
Right now, the reality is
Vanessa's not staying this week

05:54.999 --> 05:55.999
no matter how I vote.

05:56.000 --> 05:58.998
If I vote to keep Vanessa it's
just going to cause a problem

05:58.999 --> 06:00.291
with John for no reason.

06:00.292 --> 06:02.998
Sorry, Vanessa, I have to choose
the Ally who's staying in the

06:02.999 --> 06:05.998
house this week.

06:05.999 --> 06:06.000
Yeah.

06:06.000 --> 06:12.998
I just need to fiend a way to
cover it.

06:12.999 --> 06:15.998
I don't want to burn any
Bridges with shelli and John.

06:15.999 --> 06:18.998
Steve was one of the votes
they thought I could count on in

06:18.999 --> 06:24.998
the house, and he's acting super
sketch and it actually really

06:24.999 --> 06:25.999
piss me off.

06:25.999 --> 06:26.999
I don't want to lie to you.

06:26.999 --> 06:27.999
Okay.

06:28.000 --> 06:29.124
I don't want you to, either.

06:29.125 --> 06:30.998
I respect you too much to do
that to you.

06:30.999 --> 06:32.124
Okay.

06:32.125 --> 06:34.998
You understand the pickle I'm
in?

06:34.999 --> 06:36.998
Not really.

06:36.999 --> 06:37.999
Okay, just think about it.

06:38.000 --> 06:41.998
I have not promised shelli,
and trust me, it's been on my

06:41.999 --> 06:42.000
mind.

06:42.000 --> 06:43.998
Fican't count on Steve's vote
this week.

06:43.999 --> 06:46.998
Have to looka that like a
pardon betrayal, and I'm very,

06:46.999 --> 06:48.998
very disappointed about it.

06:48.999 --> 06:56.999
Go have a fun day in the pool.

07:04.999 --> 07:05.999
Good night, shelli.

07:06.000 --> 07:11.998
Good night.

07:11.999 --> 07:12.999
What are you doing?

07:13.000 --> 07:15.998
Oh, my god!

07:15.999 --> 07:18.998
Oh, my god!

07:18.999 --> 07:19.125
( Laughing ).

07:19.126 --> 07:20.998
Yeah!

07:20.999 --> 07:27.998
Got her!

07:27.999 --> 07:29.541
How are you?

07:29.542 --> 07:29.999
Good.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.998
You will have to look at my
nasty, disgusting eyes.

07:34.999 --> 07:35.999
You have seen eyes like that?

07:36.000 --> 07:37.708
They're the saddest eyes.

07:37.709 --> 07:41.998
I know I'm coming into this
thing as the underdog but I have

07:41.999 --> 07:42.999
a fighting chance.

07:43.000 --> 07:47.998
Maybe if I Fitch James a solid
enough reason he'll go for it.

07:47.999 --> 07:50.998
I feel like it's a super unfairp
situation I'm in and the reason

07:50.999 --> 07:54.998
I am in it is I gave my word and
stuck to it and other people

07:54.999 --> 07:55.834
didn't.

07:55.835 --> 07:57.998
There are some things,
obviously, that have to do with

07:57.999 --> 07:58.000
Becky.

07:58.000 --> 08:01.998
I want to show you how she's
playing the game and why it's so

08:01.999 --> 08:02.999
dangerous for everyone right
now.

08:03.000 --> 08:06.998
When you were h.O.H., she goes,
"my target is James."

08:06.999 --> 08:09.998
And I'm like, "okay.

08:09.999 --> 08:10.999
Why?"
And she's like, "well, he's on

08:11.000 --> 08:13.998
the other side of the house,
first of all."

08:13.999 --> 08:15.998
She doesn't like you personally.

08:15.999 --> 08:18.998
If she won, she was 100% putting
you up.

08:18.999 --> 08:20.998
100% you were her target.

08:20.999 --> 08:22.998
I'm telling you, James, every
conversation you have up there

08:22.999 --> 08:25.541
she was going in this little
room and telling everything to

08:25.542 --> 08:25.999
shelli and Clay.

08:26.000 --> 08:29.124
They are going to put both of
you up at the same time, all

08:29.125 --> 08:30.998
three of them.

08:30.999 --> 08:38.999
Becky, Becky, Becky.

08:41.999 --> 08:44.833
I knew there was a rat in the
group last week when I was

08:44.834 --> 08:44.999
h.O.H.

08:45.000 --> 08:48.998
Now it makes me wonder even why
I want to support Becky and do

08:48.999 --> 08:50.998
her bidding for her game.

08:50.999 --> 08:52.291
Shelli or Vanessa.

08:52.292 --> 08:54.998
Shelli or Vanessa?

08:54.999 --> 08:57.998
Who's more likely to win h.O.H.?

08:57.999 --> 09:00.998
If we send Vanessa home,
shelli wins.

09:00.999 --> 09:01.999
He goes home.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.998
For our game, yeah.

09:04.999 --> 09:06.998
Shelli needs to go.

09:06.999 --> 09:10.998
Oh, my god, she's coming
after us for sure.

09:10.999 --> 09:12.998
150% for you.

09:12.999 --> 09:16.998
But would she hold a grudge
afterwards?

09:16.999 --> 09:18.998
We have to play it safe.

09:18.999 --> 09:21.998
It's a big decision.

09:21.999 --> 09:29.999
This is a tough situation.

09:31.999 --> 09:33.998
Julie: It's time to reveal
tonight's can double eviction to

09:33.999 --> 09:36.998
the houseguests.

09:36.999 --> 09:37.999
Hello, houseguests.

09:38.000 --> 09:40.998
Hi, Julie!

09:40.999 --> 09:42.998
Julie: You've been
speculating about this for weeks

09:42.999 --> 09:43.999
now.

09:43.999 --> 09:44.000
Yup.

09:44.000 --> 09:46.998
Julie: Well, the night
you've all been waiting for is

09:46.999 --> 09:48.998
finally upon us.

09:48.999 --> 09:51.998
It is double eviction night.

09:51.999 --> 09:57.998
Before the hour is up, two of
you will leave the "big brother"

09:57.999 --> 10:00.998
house and become the first two
members of the jury.

10:00.999 --> 10:05.998
Butta I warned you last week,
just because you're out of the

10:05.999 --> 10:09.833
house doesn't necessarily mean
you're out of the game.

10:09.834 --> 10:13.998
With that, it's time to begin
the first live eviction of the

10:13.999 --> 10:14.000
evening.

10:14.000 --> 10:17.999
Shelli, Vanessa, in just a few
moments your housemates will

10:18.000 --> 10:21.998
cast their votes to evict live,
but before they do, you each

10:21.999 --> 10:26.998
have a final chance to sway
their vote with one brief

10:26.999 --> 10:27.000
statement.

10:27.000 --> 10:28.833
Shelli, you're first.

10:28.834 --> 10:31.998
Well, first of all, happy
birthday, Jason!

10:31.999 --> 10:34.541
It's his birthday today!

10:34.542 --> 10:36.998
( Applause )
The house has been pretty boring

10:36.999 --> 10:38.998
without you, I must say.

10:38.999 --> 10:41.541
To my family, I love you all so
much.

10:41.542 --> 10:44.124
I know you're all worried about
me but don't worry I'm doing

10:44.125 --> 10:44.999
just fine.

10:45.000 --> 10:46.998
Clay, I miss you so much.

10:46.999 --> 10:50.998
To the rest of all of y'all, I
mean, let's get down to the

10:50.999 --> 10:51.999
brass tacks, okay.

10:52.000 --> 10:54.998
We're nay house where we're all
pushing each other out the door

10:54.999 --> 10:57.998
and kicking each other out, but
at the end of the day I freaking

10:57.999 --> 10:58.999
love all y'all.

10:59.000 --> 11:04.998
It doesn't like, matter, and I
hope I get a chance to come back

11:04.999 --> 11:06.998
into this game and it can be
bonus.

11:06.999 --> 11:07.999
That's it!

11:08.000 --> 11:09.998
Julie: Thank you, shelli.

11:09.999 --> 11:10.000
Vanessa.

11:10.000 --> 11:10.999
Hi, you guys.

11:11.000 --> 11:13.998
So 10 years ago when I was in
law school, and grappling with

11:13.999 --> 11:16.998
what I wanted to do for the rest
of my life, I was writing in my

11:16.999 --> 11:18.998
journal, and I wrote the
following words that have guided

11:18.999 --> 11:24.998
me ever since, "I find my calm
not at the finish line looking

11:24.999 --> 11:27.124
back at the distance I've
traveled, but in the moment, on

11:27.125 --> 11:30.998
the run, out of breath, look
forward."

11:30.999 --> 11:33.998
I don't know where I'm going and
I hope to god I never get there.

11:33.999 --> 11:37.998
Because I'm happy as I am
chasing something eternal and

11:37.999 --> 11:38.000
ethereal.

11:38.000 --> 11:40.998
The destination has never been,
is not, and never will be what

11:40.999 --> 11:42.124
it is about for me.

11:42.125 --> 11:44.998
And that's j.T. Just the way I
like it.

11:44.999 --> 11:45.999
Mel, I love you more than life.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.708
I think about you every day.

11:47.709 --> 11:51.998
Mom, the rest of my family and
friends, your support means the

11:51.999 --> 11:52.417
world.

11:52.418 --> 11:53.998
Houseguests, please vote to keep
me.

11:53.999 --> 11:55.999
I don't want to get off the ride
yet.

11:56.000 --> 11:56.999
Julie: Thank you, Vanessa.

11:56.999 --> 11:57.999
Thank you, both.

11:58.000 --> 12:00.998
It's time for the live vote to
begin.

12:00.999 --> 12:03.998
Neither nominee is allowed to
vote.

12:03.999 --> 12:08.998
Becky, as head of household you
will only vote in the event of a

12:08.999 --> 12:09.000
tie.

12:09.000 --> 12:13.998
One at a time the rest of you
will enter the diary room and

12:13.999 --> 12:15.998
cast your vote to evict.

12:15.999 --> 12:16.999
Austin, you are up first.

12:17.000 --> 12:18.000
Please go to the diary room.

12:18.001 --> 12:21.998
As a member of the 6th sense
alliance, Austin is close to

12:21.999 --> 12:22.999
both nominees.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.998
Who will he let go?

12:24.999 --> 12:25.000
Hello, Austin.

12:25.000 --> 12:26.998
Hello, Julie.

12:26.999 --> 12:29.998
Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

12:29.999 --> 12:35.124
Clay, I'm very sorry to do
this, but Judas has to evict

12:35.125 --> 12:35.999
shelli.

12:35.999 --> 12:36.000
Julie: Thank you.

12:36.000 --> 12:38.998
Steve is feeling the pressure
this week, caught between

12:38.999 --> 12:43.998
helping Vanessa and doing what
he thinks the house wants.

12:43.999 --> 12:44.000
Hi, Steve.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.124
Hi, Julie.

12:45.125 --> 12:47.998
Please cast your vote to
evict.

12:47.999 --> 12:50.998
I vote to evict shelli.

12:50.999 --> 12:51.999
Julie: Thank you.

12:52.000 --> 12:56.998
Thanks, Julie glail James was
part of the plan to backdoor

12:56.999 --> 12:59.124
Vanessa this week put he knows
he could be the target of

12:59.125 --> 13:00.416
shelli's revenge.

13:00.417 --> 13:00.999
Hi, James.

13:00.999 --> 13:01.999
Hey, Julie.

13:02.000 --> 13:04.998
Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

13:04.999 --> 13:07.998
I vote to evict shelli.

13:07.999 --> 13:08.999
Julie: Thank you.

13:09.000 --> 13:10.998
Thank you, Julie.

13:10.999 --> 13:12.998
Julie: Meg is concerned
about going against the h.O.H.'S

13:12.999 --> 13:13.999
wishes this week.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.998
But what's best for her game?

13:16.999 --> 13:17.542
Hi, Meg.

13:17.543 --> 13:18.998
Hey, Julie.

13:18.999 --> 13:20.998
Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

13:20.999 --> 13:25.998
For my boo Jason, I vote to
evict shelli.

13:25.999 --> 13:26.417
Julie: Thank you.

13:26.418 --> 13:28.998
Thank you!

13:28.999 --> 13:31.998
Julie: Jackie is on to
Vanessa's tricks, so is this her

13:31.999 --> 13:35.998
chance to take Vanessa out?

13:35.999 --> 13:36.999
Hi, Jackie.

13:37.000 --> 13:39.998
Hi, Julie happy birthday,
Jason!

13:39.999 --> 13:42.998
I vote to evict shelli.

13:42.999 --> 13:46.998
Julie: Thank you.

13:46.999 --> 13:47.999
It's official.

13:48.000 --> 13:51.998
With five votes to evict shelli,
shelli will become the first

13:51.999 --> 13:54.998
member of the "big brother"
jury, but let's see how the

13:54.999 --> 13:56.998
other votes fall.

13:56.999 --> 13:57.999
Hi, Julia.

13:58.000 --> 14:00.958
Hi, Julie.

14:00.959 --> 14:01.999
Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

14:02.000 --> 14:04.833
I vote to evict shelli.

14:04.834 --> 14:06.833
Julie: Thank you.

14:06.834 --> 14:09.998
Johnny Mac is worried that
Vanessa is gunning for him, but

14:09.999 --> 14:13.541
does he know the house has
flipped?

14:13.542 --> 14:13.999
Hi, John.

14:13.999 --> 14:14.999
What do you want?

14:15.000 --> 14:16.999
Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

14:17.000 --> 14:17.999
( Laughter ).

14:18.000 --> 14:19.998
I vote to evict shelli.

14:19.999 --> 14:20.999
Julie: Thank you.

14:21.000 --> 14:24.998
Yeah, wharf.

14:24.999 --> 14:25.000
( Laughter ).

14:25.000 --> 14:27.998
Julie: Liz is aligned with
both of the nominees.

14:27.999 --> 14:30.998
Will she follow her sister's
vote?

14:30.999 --> 14:31.000
Hi, Liz.

14:31.000 --> 14:32.998
Hi, Julie.

14:32.999 --> 14:34.998
Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

14:34.999 --> 14:38.998
I unfortunately vote to evict
shelli.

14:38.999 --> 14:39.999
Julie: Thank you.

14:40.000 --> 14:48.000
Thank you.

14:53.959 --> 14:54.998
Julie: All of the votes are
in.

14:54.999 --> 14:58.998
Let's give the news to the
houseguests.

14:58.999 --> 15:00.998
Houseguests, the votes are in.

15:00.999 --> 15:03.999
When I reveal the vote, the
evicted houseguest will have

15:04.000 --> 15:07.998
just a few moments to say
good-bye, gather her belongings,

15:07.999 --> 15:09.998
and walk out the front door.

15:09.999 --> 15:15.998
By a vote of 8-0, Vanessa, you
are safe.

15:15.999 --> 15:19.998
Which means, shelli, you are
evicted from the "big brother"

15:19.999 --> 15:22.998
house.

15:22.999 --> 15:24.291
Big hugs.

15:24.292 --> 15:32.292
I love you so much!

15:45.542 --> 15:47.833
Shelli, we love you so much.

15:47.834 --> 15:48.998
I love you all!

15:48.999 --> 15:56.999
( Applause )
( Cheers and applause )

16:12.999 --> 16:17.998
All right, I have no idea how
we're going to do an h.O.H. And

16:17.999 --> 16:20.998
p.O.V. In the next 30 minutes.

16:20.999 --> 16:21.000
What?

16:21.000 --> 16:25.999
Oh!

16:26.000 --> 16:27.998
All right.

16:27.999 --> 16:29.998
Julie: Shelli.

16:29.999 --> 16:30.000
Yes.

16:30.000 --> 16:33.998
Julie: When Becky was
h.O.H., she told you you were

16:33.999 --> 16:34.999
safe.

16:34.999 --> 16:35.999
Uh-huh.

16:36.000 --> 16:38.999
Julie: She said, "Vanessa's
my target."

16:39.000 --> 16:40.958
8-0, unanimous vote.

16:40.959 --> 16:42.998
What do you think went wrong for
you?

16:42.999 --> 16:45.541
Vanessa is a good player, and
in "big brother," when someone

16:45.542 --> 16:48.291
says you're safe, you're not the
target, you always know you're

16:48.292 --> 16:49.998
probably walking out the door.

16:49.999 --> 16:50.999
So, I don't know.

16:51.000 --> 16:54.998
I think that James had a lot to
do with it, and I think Vanessa

16:54.999 --> 16:59.708
has really good game play and
she had a lot to do with it,

16:59.709 --> 16:59.999
too.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.998
Julie: Do you feel betrayed
by Vanessa your 6th sense

17:02.999 --> 17:03.125
alliance member?

17:03.126 --> 17:04.998
A bit.

17:04.999 --> 17:09.998
I can only go by heresay because
I haven't seen everything that's

17:09.999 --> 17:11.708
happened but I heard things.

17:11.709 --> 17:13.998
I know she was... well, from what
people have told me, she was

17:13.999 --> 17:17.291
kind of behind a little bit of
the "let's get the target out of

17:17.292 --> 17:18.998
Clay and shelli."

17:18.999 --> 17:20.998
And I've been told she was a
part of that.

17:20.999 --> 17:23.998
Julie: You want to see her
bounced tonight as the second

17:23.999 --> 17:24.292
person?

17:24.293 --> 17:27.708
You know, if I do come back
in the house, she is someone

17:27.709 --> 17:29.998
that... you know, I don't know.

17:29.999 --> 17:32.998
Honestly, at this point, I
really don't know.

17:32.999 --> 17:35.708
Julie: Let's talk about
Clay.

17:35.709 --> 17:35.999
You're 33.

17:35.999 --> 17:36.125
He's 23.

17:36.126 --> 17:38.998
Yeah, right.

17:38.999 --> 17:41.998
Oh, man!

17:41.999 --> 17:42.000
Shhh!

17:42.000 --> 17:42.999
He's cute, though, Julie.

17:42.999 --> 17:43.999
Julie: He is cute.

17:43.999 --> 17:44.999
I will give you that.

17:45.000 --> 17:48.708
Do you regret putting the target
on your back being in a

17:48.709 --> 17:52.998
showmance so fast and so
powerful so quickly?

17:52.999 --> 17:55.291
Um, actually, not at all.

17:55.292 --> 17:58.291
To me, I said when I came into
this house that I wanted to pick

17:58.292 --> 18:01.998
one person that could be my
loyal partner, and whether that

18:01.999 --> 18:05.998
turned into a showmance or be a
best friend, if you are riding

18:05.999 --> 18:07.998
very closely with someone, it
doesn't matter how the

18:07.999 --> 18:10.998
relationship is, you become a
target.

18:10.999 --> 18:11.000
Julie: Do you love him?

18:11.000 --> 18:12.833
Well, it's not that quick.

18:12.834 --> 18:15.291
Come on, Julie.

18:15.292 --> 18:15.999
Whoo!

18:16.000 --> 18:18.541
We're not still in the real
world yet.

18:18.542 --> 18:20.291
Julie: I asked him the same
question.

18:20.292 --> 18:21.708
Oh!

18:21.709 --> 18:22.998
Julie: I'm not saying
anymore.

18:22.999 --> 18:25.998
If you get the chance to get
back in the house, will you,

18:25.999 --> 18:26.999
would do you anything different?

18:27.000 --> 18:28.998
It will totally depend on who
is in the house.

18:28.999 --> 18:32.998
I'll tell you right now I'm
rooting for my boys Stevie and

18:32.999 --> 18:33.000
Johnny.

18:33.000 --> 18:35.998
And if they're there, you better
believe I'll be riding with them

18:35.999 --> 18:37.416
all the way.

18:37.417 --> 18:38.998
Julie: They weren't even in
your alliance.

18:38.999 --> 18:42.291
They weren't, but Clay and I
were really close to them.

18:42.292 --> 18:45.998
I've been close to Stevie since
the beginning.

18:45.999 --> 18:48.998
John has looked out for us, and
right now where I stand, we're

18:48.999 --> 18:51.124
the loners in the middle.

18:51.125 --> 18:54.998
Julie: Well, you might get
that chance, but for now you are

18:54.999 --> 18:56.998
for sure heading to the jury
house.

18:56.999 --> 18:57.000
That's right.

18:57.001 --> 18:59.998
Julie: Thank you, shelli.

18:59.999 --> 19:00.999
Thank you.

19:01.000 --> 19:02.124
Julie: Stay right there.

19:02.125 --> 19:07.998
The most excitingo night of the
summer continues with the light

19:07.999 --> 19:12.998
head of household competition,
the live veto, and the second

19:12.999 --> 19:13.999
live eviction of the night.

19:13.999 --> 19:14.999
Stay with us.

19:21.999 --> 19:29.999
Cant get enough big brother

19:40.999 --> 19:42.998
Julie: Welcome back to "big
brother."

19:42.999 --> 19:45.958
Earlier today, the houseguests
viewed video loops of themselves

19:45.959 --> 19:47.998
from earlier this summer.

19:47.999 --> 19:53.998
Clues that will be essential to
winning tonight's h.O.H.

19:53.999 --> 19:54.417
Competition.

19:54.418 --> 19:57.998
Guys, did you see the memory
wall by any chance?

19:57.999 --> 20:03.541
Time to get loopy!

20:03.542 --> 20:04.998
I'm dying.

20:04.999 --> 20:06.708
Powder puff!

20:06.709 --> 20:11.998
The memory wall just changed
to 16 ridiculous fun moments in

20:11.999 --> 20:13.416
the house.

20:13.417 --> 20:17.416
I'm terrified of what's being
shown on national television.

20:17.417 --> 20:20.998
Look at Clay's fly attack.

20:20.999 --> 20:23.958
Oh, my god.

20:23.959 --> 20:23.999
Look, Austin.

20:24.000 --> 20:27.998
The minute I see he's loops I
know it has everything to do

20:27.999 --> 20:28.999
with upcoming h.O.H.

20:28.999 --> 20:29.959
Competition.

20:29.960 --> 20:32.998
You have to study everything to
the "t."

20:32.999 --> 20:33.999
Steve went down.

20:34.000 --> 20:37.998
No!

20:37.999 --> 20:41.998
Julie: It's now time to
crown a new head of household.

20:41.999 --> 20:44.998
This h.O.H. Will have to
immediately nominate two

20:44.999 --> 20:45.999
houseguests for eviction.

20:46.000 --> 20:50.291
Let's head to the backyard and
get things started.

20:50.292 --> 20:52.124
Houseguests, the power is up for
grabs.

20:52.125 --> 20:55.998
Becky, as outgoing head of
household, you are not eligible

20:55.999 --> 20:56.959
to compete.

20:56.960 --> 20:58.998
This competition is called
"getting loopy."

20:58.999 --> 21:00.998
And here's how it works.

21:00.999 --> 21:05.998
Earlier, you all had the chance
to watch video loops of events

21:05.999 --> 21:07.998
that have taken place in the
house this summer.

21:07.999 --> 21:13.998
I will now read you a series of
statements based on the video

21:13.999 --> 21:15.124
loops you all viewed.

21:15.125 --> 21:18.998
For each question, you will
answer either true or false.

21:18.999 --> 21:21.998
If you get the answer right, you
stay in the game.

21:21.999 --> 21:25.998
Get it wrong, and you will be
eliminated.

21:25.999 --> 21:29.998
Last houseguest standing will be
the new h.O.H.

21:29.999 --> 21:30.959
Everyone understand?

21:30.960 --> 21:31.998
Yes.

21:31.999 --> 21:32.000
Yes.

21:32.001 --> 21:34.998
Julie: Good, then let's
begin.

21:34.999 --> 21:39.998
Question one, true or false, in
the conga line video, Audrey's

21:39.999 --> 21:43.998
hat was blue.

21:43.999 --> 21:46.998
Answers, please.

21:46.999 --> 21:48.998
The correct answer is false.

21:48.999 --> 21:50.998
Her hat was red.

21:50.999 --> 21:51.999
Everyone got it right.

21:51.999 --> 21:52.959
Everyone reset.

21:52.960 --> 21:54.998
Moving on to question two.

21:54.999 --> 22:00.998
True or false, in the fly attack
video, Clay was holding a bowl

22:00.999 --> 22:02.998
with his right hand.

22:02.999 --> 22:05.998
Answers, please.

22:05.999 --> 22:08.998
I need a final answer.

22:08.999 --> 22:11.998
The correct answer is false.

22:11.999 --> 22:17.998
He was holding it in his left
hand, which means James, Liz,

22:17.999 --> 22:20.998
Meg, Jackie, reset, step down.

22:20.999 --> 22:22.998
You've all been eliminated.

22:22.999 --> 22:24.998
Everyone reset as we move on to
question three.

22:24.999 --> 22:32.999
True or false, in the punchy
video, someone was in the

22:33.999 --> 22:34.000
hammock?

22:34.000 --> 22:36.998
Answers, please.

22:36.999 --> 22:40.998
The correct answer is false.

22:40.999 --> 22:41.999
Everyone got it right.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.416
Everyone reset as we move on to
question four.

22:44.417 --> 22:52.417
True or false, in the powder
puff video, three bulbs were on.

22:52.999 --> 22:54.541
Answers, please.

22:54.542 --> 22:56.998
The correct answer is false.

22:56.999 --> 23:01.998
There were two bulbs, Julia and
Vanessa reset and step down.

23:01.999 --> 23:05.541
Everyone reset.

23:05.542 --> 23:12.998
Question five, true or false, in

23:12.999 --> 23:15.998
extinguisher was visible.

23:15.999 --> 23:16.999
Answers, please.

23:17.000 --> 23:18.998
The correct answer is true.

23:18.999 --> 23:20.541
Everyone got it right.

23:20.542 --> 23:21.542

Answers, please.

23:34.417 --> 23:37.416

23:37.417 --> 23:42.833
Congratulations, Steve, you are
the new head of household.

23:42.834 --> 23:45.998
Nominations will take place in
just a few minutes.

23:45.999 --> 23:47.998
Steve, you have a very important
decision to make.

23:47.999 --> 23:55.124
I need everyone to please head
inside the house right now.

23:55.125 --> 23:59.998
Did I not tell you, that
Steve.

23:59.999 --> 24:02.998
Julie: Up next, Steve must
nominate two houseguests for

24:02.999 --> 24:03.999
eviction.

24:04.000 --> 24:08.291
Who will he put up on the block
and who will be evictd and join

24:08.292 --> 24:10.998
shelli in the jury house?

24:10.999 --> 24:12.998
Stay with us.

24:12.999 --> 24:13.292
( Applause ).

24:13.293 --> 24:19.998
You did it, Steve!

24:19.999 --> 24:21.999
Well, we got that wrong.

24:22.000 --> 24:23.998
What was the last question?

24:23.999 --> 24:26.999
It was did he have a collared
shirt?

24:27.000 --> 24:33.998
And Jason had his pink shirt...
>> We had, like, a debate about

24:33.999 --> 24:34.000
it.

24:34.000 --> 24:36.998
Vanessa, we got the same one
wrong.

24:36.999 --> 24:37.959
The bowl!

24:37.960 --> 24:39.998
I didn't even look at the bowl!

24:39.999 --> 24:40.999
Good jock, Austin.

24:40.999 --> 24:41.959
Austin!

24:41.960 --> 24:42.999
Yeah, thanks, guys.

24:43.000 --> 24:45.998
Good job!

24:45.999 --> 24:49.998
Oh, my god, I knew as soon as
she said the...

24:49.999 --> 24:50.999
The bowl!

24:51.000 --> 24:53.998
I was wondering when I was
talking to Austin, I was like, I

24:53.999 --> 24:55.919
bet... I wonder which one we
can't figure it out.

25:16.999 --> 25:18.998
Julie: Welcome back to "big
brother."

25:18.999 --> 25:21.998
Just moments ago, Steve became
the new head of household.

25:21.999 --> 25:25.998
It is now his responsibility to
put two houseguests on the

25:25.999 --> 25:26.999
chopping block.

25:27.000 --> 25:31.541
Let's head to the living room
for the live nomination

25:31.542 --> 25:32.998
ceremony.

25:32.999 --> 25:35.998
Houseguests, it is time for the
live nomination ceremony to

25:35.999 --> 25:36.000
begin.

25:36.001 --> 25:44.001
If you are not in the living
room, please go there now.

25:44.999 --> 25:48.998
It looks like you're all there.

25:48.999 --> 25:50.541
Oh, okay, thank you.

25:50.542 --> 25:51.998
Careful!

25:51.999 --> 25:54.998
Julie: Steve, as head of
household, it is now time to

25:54.999 --> 25:59.998
face your housemates and make
your two nominations.

25:59.999 --> 26:00.999
I love you all.

26:00.999 --> 26:01.999
This is a game.

26:02.000 --> 26:03.416
This is nothing personal.

26:03.417 --> 26:09.998
Meg and Jackie, I'm sorry.

26:09.999 --> 26:13.998
Julie: Meg, Jackie, thank
you for taking your slots in the

26:13.999 --> 26:14.999
nomination chairs.

26:15.000 --> 26:19.416
One of you may be the next
houseguest to be evicted, but

26:19.417 --> 26:22.998
you still have one last chance
to save yourselves because the

26:22.999 --> 26:26.998
live veto competition is next.

26:26.999 --> 26:29.998
Up next, who will win the power
of veto?

26:29.999 --> 26:34.541
And will it be used to save one
of the two nominees?

26:34.542 --> 26:35.999
Stay with us.

26:36.000 --> 26:37.840

26:51.999 --> 26:59.999
Be a fly on the wall

27:09.999 --> 27:13.416
Julie: Welcome back to a
special double eviction episode

27:13.417 --> 27:13.999
of "big brother."

27:14.000 --> 27:17.998
Already tonight, shelli was
evicted from the "big brother"

27:17.999 --> 27:18.292
house.

27:18.293 --> 27:20.998
Then Steve became the new head
of household.

27:20.999 --> 27:25.124
He then put Meg and Jackie up
for eviction.

27:25.125 --> 27:28.998
Now, the h.O.H., the two
nominees, along with John,

27:28.999 --> 27:32.958
James, and Vanessa, who were
just chosen by random draw, will

27:32.959 --> 27:36.541
face off in the power of veto
competition.

27:36.542 --> 27:40.416
At stake, the ability to change
the nominations, or keep them in

27:40.417 --> 27:41.541
place.

27:41.542 --> 27:45.998
Let's head to the backyard and
get things started.

27:45.999 --> 27:49.998
Houseguests, it's now time for
the power of veto competition.

27:49.999 --> 27:53.998
The winner of the power of veto
can use it to remove one of the

27:53.999 --> 27:59.998
nominees from the chopping block
or they can leave Steve's

27:59.999 --> 28:01.291
nominations intact.

28:01.292 --> 28:04.998
This competition is called
"slippery slope," and here's how

28:04.999 --> 28:05.999
it works.

28:06.000 --> 28:10.998
On my go, you will roll a ball
down your ski slope in which

28:10.999 --> 28:12.998
there are three holes.

28:12.999 --> 28:17.998
The goal is to get one ball into
each hole.

28:17.999 --> 28:22.998
The first houseguest to get one
ball in each of the three holes

28:22.999 --> 28:25.998
and buzz in will win the power
of veto.

28:25.999 --> 28:32.998
Keep in mind... you must sink
your balls in numerical order,

28:32.999 --> 28:34.708
one to three.

28:34.709 --> 28:38.998
If you sink them out of order,
you will be eliminated.

28:38.999 --> 28:41.999
If the game is not over after
three and a half minutes, the

28:42.000 --> 28:46.998
winner will be the houseguest
with the most balls in place in

28:46.999 --> 28:49.998
the least amount of time.

28:49.999 --> 28:51.998
Does everyone understand?

28:51.999 --> 28:53.998
Yes.

28:53.999 --> 28:56.124
Julie: Everyone yesterday.

dirt on myself.

33:08.999 --> 33:11.998

a horrible reason.

36:32.999 --> 36:36.998
One at a time, the rest of you
will enter the diary room and

36:36.999 --> 36:37.999
cast your vote to evict.

36:38.000 --> 36:40.124
Vanessa, you're up first.

36:40.125 --> 36:44.998
Please go to the diary room.

36:44.999 --> 36:47.998
Vanessa beat the odds and
survived tonight's first

36:47.999 --> 36:48.000
eviction.

36:48.000 --> 36:49.998
Now the tables have turned.

36:49.999 --> 36:52.998
So what will she do.

36:52.999 --> 36:53.000
Hi, Vanessa.

36:53.000 --> 36:54.998
Hi, Julie.

36:54.999 --> 36:56.998
Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

36:56.999 --> 36:58.999
I vote to evict Jackie.

36:59.000 --> 37:00.998
Julie: Thank you.

37:00.999 --> 37:04.833
Becky's allies abandoned her
this week, so what is best for

37:04.834 --> 37:06.708
her moving forward?

37:06.709 --> 37:07.998
Hi, Becky.

37:07.999 --> 37:09.291
Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

37:09.292 --> 37:11.998
I vote to evict Meg.

37:11.999 --> 37:15.998
Julie: Thank you.

37:15.999 --> 37:17.999
Johnny Mac came out from under
the radar this week but it

37:18.000 --> 37:19.833
didn't go as planned.

37:19.834 --> 37:22.998
So what will he do now?

37:22.999 --> 37:23.999
John, please cast your vote to
evict.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.998
I vote to evict Jackie.

37:26.999 --> 37:30.998
Julie: Thank you.

37:30.999 --> 37:33.998
Austin remains out of the
spotlight another week.

37:33.999 --> 37:37.998
Where will he throw his vote?

37:37.999 --> 37:38.999
Austin, please cast your vote to
evict.

37:39.000 --> 37:41.998
I vote to evict Jackie.

37:41.999 --> 37:42.999
Julie: Thank you.

37:43.000 --> 37:44.998
Thank you.

37:44.999 --> 37:47.998
Julie: James sent his
biggest threat out of the house

37:47.999 --> 37:48.709
earlier.

37:48.710 --> 37:52.998
Now, he has to choose between
his allies.

37:52.999 --> 37:53.000
Hello, James.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.998
Hey, Julie.

37:54.999 --> 37:55.999
Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.998
I vote to evict Jackie.

37:58.999 --> 38:01.998
Sorry, girl.

38:01.999 --> 38:02.999
Julie: Thank you.

38:03.000 --> 38:05.998
Thank you, jewel.

38:05.999 --> 38:08.998
Julie: It's official, with
four votes to evict Jackie,

38:08.999 --> 38:10.998
Jackie will be leaving the "big
brother" house tonight.

38:10.999 --> 38:12.541
Let's see how the other votes
fall.

38:12.542 --> 38:13.833
Hi, Liz.

38:13.834 --> 38:14.998
Hey, Julie.

38:14.999 --> 38:15.999
Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.998
I vote to evict Jackie.

38:18.999 --> 38:19.000
Julie: Thank you.

38:19.000 --> 38:22.416
Thank you.

38:22.417 --> 38:25.998
Julie: Julia's only true
loyalty is to her sister, so

38:25.999 --> 38:28.998
what's best for the twins
tonight?

38:28.999 --> 38:29.000
Hi, Julia.

38:29.000 --> 38:30.998
Hey, Julie.

38:30.999 --> 38:32.291
Julie: Please cast your
vote to evict.

38:32.292 --> 38:34.998
I vote to evict Jackie.

38:34.999 --> 38:42.999
Julie: Thank you.

38:48.999 --> 38:49.999
All of the votes are in.

38:50.000 --> 38:54.998
Let's give the news to the
houseguests.

38:54.999 --> 38:58.708
Houseguests, just a reminder,
when I reveal the vote, the

38:58.709 --> 39:01.998
evicted houseguest will have
just a few moments to say

39:01.999 --> 39:03.541
good-bye and walk out the front
door.

39:03.542 --> 39:09.998
By a vote of 6-1, Jackie, you
are evicted from the "big

39:09.999 --> 39:12.124
brother" house.

39:12.125 --> 39:13.998
I'm so sorry, Jackie.

39:13.999 --> 39:21.998
It's okay.

39:21.999 --> 39:22.999
I love you so much.

39:23.000 --> 39:24.998
I love you guys.

39:24.999 --> 39:27.708
I love you guys.

39:27.709 --> 39:32.998
You've got to get back here!

39:32.999 --> 39:34.833
Of course, Steve!

39:34.834 --> 39:35.000
It's okay!

39:35.000 --> 39:35.999
It's okay!

39:36.000 --> 39:37.998
I'm sorry, Jackie.

39:37.999 --> 39:38.542
Come back.

39:38.543 --> 39:41.998
Bye, Jackie.

39:41.999 --> 39:43.541
We're going to miss you!

39:43.542 --> 39:44.833
I don't have anything!

39:44.834 --> 39:45.998
I love you guys.

39:45.999 --> 39:52.998
<i>( Applause ) </i>>> I'm coming back!

39:52.999 --> 39:54.998
Be a super hero!

39:54.999 --> 40:02.999
( Applause )
( Cheers and applause )

40:08.999 --> 40:16.998
Sorry, that was, like, a
shocker.

40:16.999 --> 40:18.998
We love you, Meg.

40:18.999 --> 40:21.998
That was too much.

40:21.999 --> 40:22.000
God.

40:22.000 --> 40:26.998
She's even beautiful in black
and white!

40:26.999 --> 40:30.291
Julie: All right, Jackie,
in your final pleas, you were

40:30.292 --> 40:32.998
talking about miscommunication
pup seemed to know you would be

40:32.998 --> 40:33.998
What were you talking about?

40:33.999 --> 40:38.541
So, Steve had put me up when
I was h.O.H. Last.

40:38.542 --> 40:41.998
He thought that... or he was told
that I was going to backdoor him

40:41.999 --> 40:44.541
but I was actually going to
backdoor Austin.

40:44.542 --> 40:45.998
Austin knows that.

40:45.999 --> 40:46.999
Everyone in the house knows
that.

40:47.000 --> 40:48.998
So I don't know who planted that
on human.

40:48.999 --> 40:49.999
Julie: Hmmm.

40:50.000 --> 40:51.998
It's okay.

40:51.999 --> 40:55.998
Julie: When you first
entered you and Jeff were the

40:55.999 --> 40:56.999
"amazing racers."

40:57.000 --> 40:59.998
And it seemed when Jeff left the
house your game came to life.

40:59.999 --> 41:00.999
It did.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.998
Julie: Was it actually
easier to play this without Jeff

41:03.999 --> 41:06.998
in there with Jew it was a very
interesting game with Jeff,

41:06.999 --> 41:07.000
definitely.

41:07.000 --> 41:09.998
It was weird being there with
him at first, I hadn't seen him

41:09.999 --> 41:10.999
fair while.

41:11.000 --> 41:14.998
He's very more outspoken and he
definitely was the life of the

41:14.999 --> 41:15.000
house.

41:15.000 --> 41:17.998
So I kind of took a little
backseat there but that's okay

41:17.999 --> 41:20.999
that's how I wanted to play, lay
low, get to know everyone.

41:21.000 --> 41:23.998
Julie: If you get the
chance to get back in there,

41:23.999 --> 41:25.998
will you do anything
differently?

41:25.999 --> 41:30.998
Hmmm... I mean, I feel like I
played a loyal game.

41:30.999 --> 41:32.998
I wanted to get to know
everybody.

41:32.999 --> 41:34.998
I guess just keep my eyes a
little more open.

41:34.999 --> 41:37.291
Julie: For now you're off
to the jury house.

41:37.292 --> 41:38.998
Thank you, Julie!

41:38.999 --> 41:39.999
Julie: Thank you so much.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.998
Stay right there.

41:41.999 --> 41:44.291
Nine houseguests remain in the
race to a half million dollars.

41:44.292 --> 41:46.998
Tune in Sunday to see which one
of them will become the new head

41:46.999 --> 41:49.998
of household and which two will
be nominated for eviction.

41:49.999 --> 41:53.541
And on Wednesday, the power of
veto supfor grabs and holds the

41:53.542 --> 41:57.708
power to save one of the two
nominees.

41:57.709 --> 42:00.998
Then one week from tonight I'll
be back for the next live

42:00.999 --> 42:01.999
eviction.

42:02.000 --> 42:06.998
And don't mis"big brother after
dark" airing tonight and every

42:06.999 --> 42:07.999
night on pop.

42:08.000 --> 42:10.998
For now, let's eavesdrop on the
houseguests.

42:10.999 --> 42:15.998
From outside the "big brother"
house with Jackie, I'm Julie

42:15.999 --> 42:16.000
chen.

42:16.000 --> 42:16.999
Good night.

42:17.000 --> 42:23.998
( Applause )
>> Okay, Stephen.

42:23.999 --> 42:31.999
Well, that all just happened.

42:32.999 --> 42:34.998
( Whispering )
Lawyer.

42:34.999 --> 42:36.998
I don't know.

42:36.999 --> 42:37.999
They were dancing in there.

42:38.000 --> 42:41.998
Who?

42:41.999 --> 42:48.999
And Austin.
