00:02.524 --> 00:04.047
Beth, this is Doreen Paulson.

00:04.091 --> 00:05.701
She's our in-house attorney.

00:05.744 --> 00:07.050
DOREEN:
It's come to our attention

00:07.094 --> 00:09.313
that you may have falsified
a quote.

00:09.357 --> 00:11.359
AMBER:
We all know your reputation.

00:11.402 --> 00:13.013
The way you were fired
from the Chronicle.

00:13.056 --> 00:14.144
You don't know
what you're talking about.

00:14.188 --> 00:15.798
I was wrongfully accused.

00:15.841 --> 00:17.147
WES:
Ellie, baby, say cheese.

00:17.191 --> 00:18.888
Ah, perfect!

00:18.931 --> 00:20.455
I want a cousin.

00:20.498 --> 00:21.978
There are some people

00:22.022 --> 00:24.285
who can have babies
like Mommy and Daddy,

00:24.328 --> 00:26.809
and then there are some people
like me and your Uncle Marco,

00:26.852 --> 00:28.071
who can't.

00:28.115 --> 00:29.594
This one's for you.

00:29.638 --> 00:30.682
It's from Toni Plimpton.

00:30.726 --> 00:32.249
FIONA:
The Duck Cutter!

00:32.293 --> 00:34.077
-[gunshot]
-BETH: "Three and a half

00:34.121 --> 00:36.471
"years ago, I was convicted
of murdering my husband.

00:36.514 --> 00:38.342
"I could come to peace with that
if I had pulled the trigger,

00:38.386 --> 00:39.909
but I didn't do it."

00:39.952 --> 00:41.171
FIONA:
You don't believe this woman,

00:41.215 --> 00:42.477
do you?
I mean, the whole thing

00:42.520 --> 00:44.044
seems super sketchy.

00:44.087 --> 00:45.567
Who did kill Wallace?

00:45.610 --> 00:48.831
Wyatt, Wallace's brother.
They ran guns.

00:48.874 --> 00:50.398
That's the guy
the D.A. should've gone after,

00:50.441 --> 00:52.661
but who's serving time?

00:58.362 --> 01:00.451
[sirens wailing]

01:03.324 --> 01:05.282
-[dog barking]
-Wyatt Plimpton?

01:05.326 --> 01:07.545
[dog snarling, barking]

01:14.117 --> 01:15.249
Hi there.

01:15.292 --> 01:16.989
[dog barking, growling]

01:17.033 --> 01:18.643
Down, Freddy! Down!

01:18.687 --> 01:20.689
-[kick lands]
-[Freddy barks, whimpers]

01:20.732 --> 01:21.907
Who the fuck are you?

01:21.951 --> 01:23.561
Uh, I'm a journalist.

01:23.605 --> 01:25.737
Uh, I'm here to ask you
a few questions

01:25.781 --> 01:27.696
about the night
your brother was murdered.

01:27.739 --> 01:29.001
-Oh.
-Nope.

01:29.045 --> 01:30.742
I don't talk to the press.

01:30.786 --> 01:32.440
Mr. Plimpton, I think you're
misunderstanding. I'm not...

01:32.483 --> 01:33.528
You got, you got five seconds
to get off the property.

01:33.571 --> 01:34.833
-[Beth groans]
-One.

01:34.877 --> 01:36.226
-Okay, can I just explain?
-Two.

01:36.270 --> 01:37.227
I'm not with the press
in the traditional sense.

01:37.271 --> 01:38.533
-Three.
-I'm...

01:38.576 --> 01:40.100
-Four.
-I'm in TV.

01:40.143 --> 01:41.884
What kind of TV?

01:41.927 --> 01:44.756
Right, so w-we're making
a show about women.

01:44.800 --> 01:47.194
-What kind of show?
-Awful women.

01:47.237 --> 01:51.589
It's-it's called, uh, Crazy...
Crazy Bitches Who Kill.

01:51.633 --> 01:54.462
Crazy Bitches Who Kill?

01:54.505 --> 01:56.203
Yeah.

01:56.246 --> 01:57.769
I would watch that show.

01:57.813 --> 01:59.293
I would straight--
I would fucking watch that show.

01:59.336 --> 02:01.556
Every bitch I know is
fucking crazy.

02:01.599 --> 02:02.861
[chuckles]: Oh, God.

02:02.905 --> 02:04.515
-I know, right?
-[Wyatt scoffs]

02:04.559 --> 02:06.648
Um, but why watch the show
when you could star in it?

02:06.691 --> 02:09.259
We want to profile you.

02:09.303 --> 02:10.391
Word?

02:13.785 --> 02:15.613
How do I know you're not just
some psycho bitch

02:15.657 --> 02:17.224
out here to fuck me over,
you know what I'm saying?

02:17.267 --> 02:19.139
You say you're from TV, huh?

02:19.182 --> 02:20.183
Uh, then where's your cameras
at, you know what I'm saying?

02:20.227 --> 02:21.532
Where's your microphones?

02:21.576 --> 02:23.273
Where's your little
pretty makeups and shit?

02:23.317 --> 02:24.796
You know what I'm saying?
Where's the glamour?

02:24.840 --> 02:26.233
Preliminary, uh,
interview first,

02:26.276 --> 02:29.366
and-and-and then, uh,
that comes after we've...

02:29.410 --> 02:31.107
Oh, you think I'm stupid,
don't you?

02:31.151 --> 02:32.326
Think you can just come up here
and lie to my face?

02:32.369 --> 02:35.155
-Hell no!
-No! Ah! Goddamn it!

02:35.198 --> 02:37.157
Why would, why would you do
that? Why would you stick

02:37.200 --> 02:39.028
your foot in the door
as I'm trying to slam the shit?

02:39.071 --> 02:40.377
[inhales sharply]

02:40.421 --> 02:42.205
You got a small-ass brain
or something?

02:42.249 --> 02:44.076
Mr. Plimpton, please.
If I could...

02:44.120 --> 02:45.904
I'm not lying
when I tell you that

02:45.948 --> 02:48.516
what happened to your family
was... was brutal.

02:48.559 --> 02:50.213
And unfair.

02:50.257 --> 02:53.434
That crazy woman Toni,
she took your brother from you.

02:53.477 --> 02:56.567
I think the world needs to hear
your story.

02:56.611 --> 02:58.700
Sorry.
D-Do you have any ice?

02:58.743 --> 02:59.788
Can...

03:01.703 --> 03:03.357
Yeah, come on in.

03:03.400 --> 03:04.749
Of course I got fucking ice.

03:04.793 --> 03:07.143
It's just frozen water.

03:09.667 --> 03:11.756
â™ª

03:19.111 --> 03:21.201
-What? No fucking way.
-Yep.

03:21.244 --> 03:23.028
Straight up, true.

03:23.072 --> 03:26.206
Yeah, Wally would be over there
making us pancakes and shit,

03:26.249 --> 03:27.598
and when we weren't looking,
homeboy would be dunking

03:27.642 --> 03:29.165
his fucking nuts
up in the batter.

03:29.209 --> 03:32.255
Wait, so, so...
Wallace lived here?

03:32.299 --> 03:33.474
Yeah, this was his house,
you know what I'm saying?

03:33.517 --> 03:34.562
He got shot right there.

03:34.605 --> 03:35.911
-[gunshot]
-[sizzling]

03:35.954 --> 03:37.782
-Right there?
-Yep.

03:37.826 --> 03:40.568
Before Toni dragged his ass off
to be trampled by the buffalo.

03:40.611 --> 03:42.526
I tell you what,

03:42.570 --> 03:44.485
Toni, she...

03:44.528 --> 03:46.617
[sighs] I met some crazy ones,
but Toni,

03:46.661 --> 03:48.010
she wasn't just crazy,
she made him crazy.

03:48.053 --> 03:49.446
I mean, she maimed
the motherfucker.

03:49.490 --> 03:51.231
He didn't even do shit,
you know what I'm saying?

03:51.274 --> 03:53.145
That'd been my wife,
damn, I would smoke the bitch.

03:53.189 --> 03:54.451
-Bam! You know what I'm saying?
-[gasps]

03:54.495 --> 03:56.888
No, of course.
I totally get that.

03:56.932 --> 03:59.717
Um, so this was her house, too?

03:59.761 --> 04:02.503
[scoffs] Yeah, she wishes.

04:02.546 --> 04:04.287
Wh-What's it called when
someone, like, lives somewhere

04:04.331 --> 04:05.419
but they, like, never pay rent,

04:05.462 --> 04:06.724
they just live there for free?

04:06.768 --> 04:08.248
A squatter?

04:08.291 --> 04:10.250
Yep, squatter.
She was a fucking squatter.

04:10.293 --> 04:12.469
A magician-ass squatter,
you know what I'm saying?

04:12.513 --> 04:14.341
Like, she had his ass
believing he loved her.

04:14.384 --> 04:16.995
[scoffs] I mean, like,
I'll tell you what, though,

04:17.039 --> 04:19.302
like, I mean, he loved
that sweet ass.

04:19.346 --> 04:21.130
I'll give it to her,
she was fucking fine.

04:21.173 --> 04:22.218
You know what I'm saying?
She was some A1 spank fuel.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.959
I thought they didn't get along.

04:24.002 --> 04:25.439
You never knew with those two,
you know what I'm saying?

04:25.482 --> 04:27.136
-[laughter]
-One day it'd be all, like,

04:27.179 --> 04:30.313
-kissy-kissy, fucky-fucky.
-[laughing]: Stop!

04:30.357 --> 04:32.141
Stop.

04:32.184 --> 04:33.751
Next day, like,
you know what I'm saying,

04:33.795 --> 04:35.187
he'd be mad as hell at her
for something.

04:35.231 --> 04:37.146
Wally, I said stop!

04:37.189 --> 04:39.279
Oh. I'm so-- I'm sorry.

04:39.322 --> 04:40.932
No, I just... Wally.

04:40.976 --> 04:42.238
-Get the fuck back here!
-Wally, Wally!

04:42.282 --> 04:43.239
-Stop!
-[door slams]

04:43.283 --> 04:45.937
[sniffles, groans]

04:45.981 --> 04:47.504
That's what's up.

04:47.548 --> 04:49.332
Ain't no road flares,
cold medicine in this shit.

04:49.376 --> 04:51.073
You know what I'm saying?
I get this imported from, uh,

04:51.116 --> 04:52.379
Hawaii, you know
what I'm saying?

04:52.422 --> 04:54.250
A little Honolulu style.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.208
You want to hit this?
You want a little aloha?

04:56.252 --> 04:58.515
Oh, I would love an aloha,

04:58.559 --> 05:01.170
but, um,
not while I'm on the clock.

05:01.213 --> 05:03.651
Word. I hear that. I hear that.
You know what I'm saying?

05:03.694 --> 05:05.130
A working girl,
you know what I'm saying?

05:05.174 --> 05:06.175
You got to keep
your mental straight.

05:06.218 --> 05:07.437
Right.

05:07.481 --> 05:08.960
Um, what line of work
are you in?

05:09.004 --> 05:12.355
Um... I got a card right here,
actually.

05:13.356 --> 05:15.706
-Mile-High Linens?
-Yep. Linens.

05:15.750 --> 05:17.404
-Regional delivery manager.
-Yeah.

05:17.447 --> 05:18.753
-Cool.
-That's what's up.

05:18.796 --> 05:20.450
And-and Wallace, too?

05:20.494 --> 05:22.322
Yeah, it's a family affair,
you know what I'm saying?

05:22.365 --> 05:24.367
-Family business.
-Hmm.

05:24.411 --> 05:26.238
Is there a lot of money
in linens?

05:26.282 --> 05:28.719
Yes. You look educated,

05:28.763 --> 05:30.591
but you're coming off
lightweight dumb, for real.

05:30.634 --> 05:33.115
Know what I'm saying, dressed
like a time traveler and shit.

05:33.158 --> 05:34.682
Yo, let me just show you
some stuff.

05:34.725 --> 05:36.161
I'll show you what
linens gets you, straight up.

05:36.205 --> 05:37.902
Come take a look at this.

05:38.903 --> 05:40.340
Yep, check it out.

05:40.383 --> 05:42.254
This is the entertainment dojo
right here,

05:42.298 --> 05:43.952
-you know what I'm saying? Yeah.
-Whoa.

05:43.995 --> 05:45.867
-All this from linens?
-Yep, all of it.

05:45.910 --> 05:47.869
Linen Kingdom,
that's what I call it.

05:47.912 --> 05:49.827
Anyway, check it out,
I got my katanas right here.

05:49.871 --> 05:51.873
They're ceremonial, but, uh,
you know what I'm saying?

05:51.916 --> 05:53.788
I know how to use 'em,
self-taught.

05:53.831 --> 05:56.312
Do you keep a lot of weapons
in the house?

05:56.356 --> 05:57.879
Oh, yeah, you got to.

05:57.922 --> 05:59.402
Say a bunch of illegals
come in here and try to rape me.

05:59.446 --> 06:00.882
[unsheathes sword]

06:01.839 --> 06:04.755
Know what I'm saying? They
wouldn't get past the mailbox.

06:04.799 --> 06:06.409
And if they do
slip in the house--

06:06.453 --> 06:08.106
and that's a big if--

06:08.150 --> 06:09.717
oh, it's Wu-Tang time, baby.

06:09.760 --> 06:11.283
Shaolin, motherfucker.

06:11.327 --> 06:12.372
-Oh!
-[Freddy barking]

06:12.415 --> 06:13.329
-Hell yeah.
-Oh, my God.

06:13.373 --> 06:14.939
Aw, chill, Freddy.

06:14.983 --> 06:16.419
That's Lucy right there.

06:16.463 --> 06:17.986
-[hissing]
-You scared?

06:18.029 --> 06:19.204
What is that?

06:19.248 --> 06:20.554
It's a dragon
from the isle of Komodo.

06:20.597 --> 06:22.599
Yep, she's a little
bunny rabbit,

06:22.643 --> 06:24.601
unless she catches the whiff
of a fertile woman.

06:24.645 --> 06:26.429
What?

06:26.473 --> 06:28.213
Yeah, if she catches a whiff
of you when you're on the rag,

06:28.257 --> 06:31.565
she will eat your insides out,
fucking K.D. Lang style.

06:31.608 --> 06:33.436
Saying, eating pussy for real.

06:33.480 --> 06:35.177
Talk about a crazy bitch.

06:35.220 --> 06:37.092
[hissing]

06:38.093 --> 06:40.225
Yo...

06:40.269 --> 06:43.141
You still bleed?

06:43.185 --> 06:45.230
Yeah.

06:46.797 --> 06:48.451
That's what's up.

06:48.495 --> 06:50.758
Yo, this is what I want
to show you right here.

06:50.801 --> 06:52.890
Check this out.

06:52.934 --> 06:54.283
Boom.

06:54.326 --> 06:55.502
BETH [sighs]:
Oh.

06:55.545 --> 06:57.329
Cool boat.

06:57.373 --> 07:00.855
Yep. That was Wally's pride
and joy right there.

07:00.898 --> 07:02.378
Yep.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.640
He never even got to use it,
though,

07:03.684 --> 07:04.946
you know what I'm saying,
because, uh...

07:04.989 --> 07:06.774
'cause he, uh...
[clears throat]

07:06.817 --> 07:08.297
Fucking Toni.

07:08.340 --> 07:09.777
Fucking Toni had to go
fucking shoot him,

07:09.820 --> 07:11.126
like the fucking stupid bitch
that she is,

07:11.169 --> 07:12.780
and fucked everything up.

07:12.823 --> 07:14.738
I'm s-so sorry.

07:14.782 --> 07:16.479
-Goddamn! You fucking...
-Oh, God!

07:16.523 --> 07:18.873
-Fuck.
-[sighs]: Yeah.

07:18.916 --> 07:20.483
It's chill, it's chill.
It's just whatever, just...

07:20.527 --> 07:22.224
But how about I-I give you
a minute?

07:22.267 --> 07:23.878
Uh, is-is the bathroom
down the hall?

07:23.921 --> 07:25.445
Yeah, just down--
Yeah, go-- Yeah.

07:25.488 --> 07:26.881
Okay.

07:27.838 --> 07:29.927
[dance music playing faintly]

07:31.668 --> 07:33.496
[dishes clatter]

07:34.845 --> 07:37.282
[door creaks]

07:47.075 --> 07:49.164
[gasps quietly]

07:56.737 --> 07:59.435
-The fuck are you doing?
-Um...

07:59.479 --> 08:01.002
-Where's the bathroom?
-Who the fuck are you,

08:01.045 --> 08:02.873
and what are you doing?

08:02.917 --> 08:05.180
I'm here to, uh...

08:05.223 --> 08:06.834
Wyatt!

08:06.877 --> 08:08.531
[sniffs, clears throat]
Yo, Georgie.

08:08.575 --> 08:10.402
Fucking chill out.
Be nice to the little lady.

08:10.446 --> 08:12.361
Bro, she's snooping in our shit.

08:12.404 --> 08:14.276
-Oh, word? You snooping?
-No. No.

08:14.319 --> 08:15.799
I wa-- I was
looking for the bathroom.

08:15.843 --> 08:17.845
-She was looking in the closet.
-No, I wasn't.

08:17.888 --> 08:19.455
I wasn't.

08:19.499 --> 08:21.849
-I swear. I wasn't.
-What's the deal?

08:21.892 --> 08:23.546
You fucking pooping
or you snooping?

08:23.590 --> 08:25.592
You calling my boy a liar?

08:27.550 --> 08:29.944
You know what, I don't,
I don't need this.

08:29.987 --> 08:33.904
I-I thought you might be
a good interview for the show,

08:33.948 --> 08:37.342
but this-this tough guy shit,
this is boring.

08:37.386 --> 08:38.996
Uh, and as you say,

08:39.040 --> 08:41.521
there's-there's tons of
crazy bitches out there, so...

08:41.564 --> 08:43.914
Yeah, it's chill.

08:43.958 --> 08:45.394
-It's chill.
-Okay.

08:45.437 --> 08:47.701
-Thanks for the peas. Oh!
-Yo, hold the fuck up.

08:47.744 --> 08:49.311
-Chill the fuck out, man!
-Don't you fucking push me.

08:49.354 --> 08:50.617
[Freddy barking]

08:50.660 --> 08:52.053
Oh, yeah,
you're gonna fucking hit me?

08:52.096 --> 08:53.576
Gonna fucking hit me?
Oh, go for it.

08:53.620 --> 08:55.230
'Cause if you punch me,
you know what,

08:55.273 --> 08:56.318
you got to find
a new fucking boat to live in.

08:56.361 --> 08:57.580
-[barks]
-[gasps]

08:57.624 --> 08:59.060
Man, you're fucking high
as shit!

08:59.103 --> 09:01.149
You fucking,
fucking chill the fuck out!

09:02.585 --> 09:04.369
Yeah, that's right,
you little pussy.

09:04.413 --> 09:05.806
Yeah.

09:05.849 --> 09:08.330
Fucking, fucking walk.
Pussing out as usual.

09:13.161 --> 09:14.597
-[bangs wall]
-[gasps]

09:14.641 --> 09:16.381
-Fucking dumbass.
-Okay.

09:17.382 --> 09:19.646
-Oh, God!
-Hold the fuck up.

09:19.689 --> 09:21.561
I did not get your name.

09:21.604 --> 09:24.564
It's Vivian.
Uh, Vivian Steele.

09:24.607 --> 09:26.566
Word. All right,
Vivian Steele.

09:26.609 --> 09:29.569
Well, you know where to find me.

09:30.700 --> 09:33.050
-GEORGE: What the fuck?
-WYATT: Shit, man.

09:33.094 --> 09:34.617
GEORGE: Why the fuck
did you invite her in?

09:34.661 --> 09:36.271
WYATT:
Nice one, you fucking dumbass.

09:36.314 --> 09:38.099
-Trying to get my dick wet.
-GEORGE: Fuck you.

09:38.142 --> 09:40.667
-[panting]
-[siren wailing in distance]

09:40.710 --> 09:42.103
[car door opens]

09:43.539 --> 09:45.149
Oh, my God.

09:45.193 --> 09:47.151
-Oh, my God, oh, my God.
-[Freddy barks in distance]

09:47.195 --> 09:48.892
[sighs]

09:48.936 --> 09:50.938
Vivian Steele?

09:50.981 --> 09:52.679
Fuck.

09:56.378 --> 09:58.423
â™ª

10:01.339 --> 10:02.384
[sighs]

10:07.171 --> 10:08.564
-[quiet chatter]
-I found it. The big one.

10:08.608 --> 10:09.652
Toni Plimpton.

10:10.958 --> 10:12.133
FIONA: What, the psycho?
Did you go and see her?

10:12.176 --> 10:13.656
BETH:
Yes, I did.

10:13.700 --> 10:15.745
And her brother-in-law,
who's actually psycho,

10:15.789 --> 10:18.269
-he owns a dragon.
-I'm sorry, a dragon?

10:18.313 --> 10:21.403
Yeah, like a, like a monster
in his house, like a pet.

10:21.446 --> 10:22.926
Will someone please tell me
what we're talking about?

10:22.970 --> 10:25.581
Toni Plimpton. She was convicted
of killing her husband

10:25.625 --> 10:28.236
three and a half years ago,
but it's actually a story

10:28.279 --> 10:30.542
of a young African American
wife and mother,

10:30.586 --> 10:32.936
who was raised in a,
in a country that systematically

10:32.980 --> 10:34.764
kept her down
and locked her up.

10:34.808 --> 10:36.244
Are you talking
about the Dick Cutter?

10:36.287 --> 10:37.637
Yes. You've heard of her, too?

10:37.680 --> 10:38.899
-Yeah.
-BETH: Okay, okay. [stammers]

10:38.942 --> 10:40.596
She-she nicked
her husband's penis once,

10:40.640 --> 10:42.163
but that, but that's not
the whole story.

10:42.206 --> 10:44.078
-Well...
-It'd be the whole story for me.

10:44.121 --> 10:46.080
Amber, trust me.
It has everything.

10:46.123 --> 10:47.951
It has guns, murder, injustice.

10:47.995 --> 10:51.607
So, you want to write a story
about you saving a Black woman?

10:51.651 --> 10:53.696
Uh, no,
the story's not about me.

10:53.740 --> 10:57.395
But the goal is to save her,
right?

10:57.439 --> 11:00.877
From a life of
wrongful incarceration, sure.

11:00.921 --> 11:02.531
PIERRE:
She cut a dick.

11:02.574 --> 11:05.012
There are consequences
when you do that.

11:05.055 --> 11:06.666
Oh, fuck off, Pierre.

11:06.709 --> 11:10.974
It... reeks of white saviorism.
Right?

11:11.932 --> 11:13.281
FIONA:
Sure.

11:13.324 --> 11:16.066
But maybe we're not
understanding.

11:16.110 --> 11:18.199
Okay?
If Toni was white,

11:18.242 --> 11:20.331
you'd still love the story,
right?

11:20.375 --> 11:22.072
Right, but if Toni was white,
she wouldn't be in prison.

11:22.116 --> 11:24.727
-Fair point.
-Sorry, Beth.

11:24.771 --> 11:26.598
-I don't like the optics.
-The optics?

11:26.642 --> 11:28.644
Since when does Fiona
have to be a wizard

11:28.688 --> 11:30.690
-to write about wizards?
-Dude, what the fuck?

11:30.733 --> 11:32.692
-Sorry.
-Please tell me you didn't just

11:32.735 --> 11:34.432
equate America's original sin

11:34.476 --> 11:35.956
with Ron Weasley.

11:35.999 --> 11:37.653
Okay, I'm sorry, you guys.

11:37.697 --> 11:38.915
I've been doing this
a lot longer than all of you,

11:38.959 --> 11:42.136
and this is
a huge opportunity.

11:42.179 --> 11:45.269
I just feel like, when do we
ever get to write a story

11:45.313 --> 11:48.185
that's great
and also redeems a human life?

11:48.229 --> 11:51.145
But that's-that's why
we signed up for the job.

11:51.188 --> 11:53.495
Or at least it's why I did.

11:55.149 --> 11:57.499
Fine, but please,

11:57.542 --> 11:59.631
God, keep it short for once.

11:59.675 --> 12:00.763
Oh, thank you.

12:00.807 --> 12:02.243
Mwah! I love you.

12:02.286 --> 12:04.201
-[coworkers murmur]
-Never do that again.

12:04.245 --> 12:05.725
Okay.

12:08.466 --> 12:10.947
-Hey, you owe me.
-I'm sorry. I do. I owe you.

12:10.991 --> 12:13.080
â™ª

12:23.830 --> 12:25.309
Hi there.

12:25.353 --> 12:27.137
Beth Burgess
to see Toni Plimpton.

12:27.181 --> 12:28.835
Are you a lawyer?

12:28.878 --> 12:31.011
No.

12:31.054 --> 12:32.969
No visits on Thursdays
unless you're a lawyer.

12:33.013 --> 12:34.928
Okay, well, I'm a,
I'm a journalist.

12:34.971 --> 12:37.017
And I'm working
on Ms. Plimpton's case,

12:37.060 --> 12:39.323
so in a way I-I'm like a lawyer.

12:39.367 --> 12:41.282
She's not a lawyer.

12:41.325 --> 12:43.327
Not a lawyer exactly.

12:43.371 --> 12:44.764
No. Look, I need to see

12:44.807 --> 12:46.417
-Toni Plimpton.
-No.

12:46.461 --> 12:49.812
I don't think you understand
the stakes here.

12:49.856 --> 12:51.161
That woman is innocent.

12:51.205 --> 12:52.815
Do you understand Thursday?

12:52.859 --> 12:54.904
No visits on Thursday.

12:54.948 --> 12:56.993
Okay, uh...

12:57.037 --> 12:58.429
Could-could I call her?

12:58.473 --> 12:59.822
Or-or could you have her
call me?

12:59.866 --> 13:01.302
That's my card.

13:02.172 --> 13:04.784
Lady, do you get
how a prison works?

13:04.827 --> 13:07.395
BETH:
I know she has rights.

13:07.438 --> 13:10.137
Uh, this has to be
a violation of her rights.

13:10.180 --> 13:11.529
-That's really funny.
-[guard laughs]

13:11.573 --> 13:14.141
Oh, man.
Can you say that again,

13:14.184 --> 13:15.969
just the way you said it?

13:16.012 --> 13:17.884
I want to remember it
to tell it to the guys.

13:17.927 --> 13:20.669
Okay. Go ahead.
Mock me, threaten me.

13:20.712 --> 13:24.064
I'm not leaving
until I see Toni Plimpton, okay?

13:24.107 --> 13:25.239
This is a protest.

13:25.282 --> 13:27.284
So, until you let me in,

13:27.328 --> 13:30.897
I'm-a stay right here,
raising hell!

13:31.898 --> 13:34.596
ANCHORMAN [on TV]: The body
was found in the area east...

13:34.639 --> 13:36.206
[phone chimes, vibrates]

13:36.250 --> 13:37.729
Cause of death appears

13:37.773 --> 13:39.253
-to be strangulation.
-[sighs]: Shit.

13:39.296 --> 13:41.211
No suspects have been
arrested yet.

13:41.255 --> 13:43.518
TESSA: And that'll be Denver's
seventh homicide this year.

13:43.561 --> 13:45.825
Tragic stuff.

13:45.868 --> 13:49.524
But... on a lighter note,
uh, tonight

13:49.567 --> 13:51.395
I will be accepting my first

13:51.439 --> 13:54.007
Colorado Journalist
Association award,

13:54.050 --> 13:57.532
and I am just so beyond humbled.

13:57.575 --> 14:00.796
And I vow, I vow
to continue bringing you

14:00.840 --> 14:02.624
the stories
that matter most.

14:02.667 --> 14:04.844
De mi corazÃ³n a tuya,

14:04.887 --> 14:06.628
as my father used to say,
in heaven.

14:06.671 --> 14:08.673
"From my heart...
[kiss]

14:08.717 --> 14:11.285
to yours."

14:11.328 --> 14:13.722
ANCHORMAN: Thank you for that,
Tessa. In other news...

14:13.765 --> 14:15.680
Hello again.

14:15.724 --> 14:17.682
Do you happen to know if, uh,

14:17.726 --> 14:21.512
any other journalists
have come by to visit?

14:21.556 --> 14:24.472
Tessa Flores? She's...

14:24.515 --> 14:28.476
she's TV-pretty but in person
her head is way too big.

14:30.130 --> 14:31.392
[Beth sighs]

14:34.003 --> 14:36.005
Um...

14:36.049 --> 14:38.312
Have you heard
of Susan Burgess?

14:38.355 --> 14:41.924
She wrote a best-selling memoir
called Acts of Devotion,

14:41.968 --> 14:43.926
about a single mom
in the '80s.

14:43.970 --> 14:47.147
Kind of reinvented our concept
of modern motherhood.

14:47.190 --> 14:48.931
[sighs]

14:48.975 --> 14:51.151
Well, I'm her daughter.

14:53.283 --> 14:56.417
[quietly]:
Not a big reader? Okay.

15:02.945 --> 15:04.686
Five minutes.

15:06.079 --> 15:08.168
â™ª

15:10.779 --> 15:12.346
Get off me!

15:12.389 --> 15:15.697
I'm a taxpaying citizen!
I have the right to be here!

15:15.740 --> 15:18.308
-[Beth groans]
-OFFICER: Don't come back!

15:20.049 --> 15:22.530
I want my 20 bucks back!

15:24.358 --> 15:26.447
[busy chatter]

15:30.146 --> 15:31.974
You guys,
I'm so sorry I'm late.

15:32.018 --> 15:33.410
My boss is a total lunatic.

15:33.454 --> 15:35.586
-Hi.
-Hey.

15:35.630 --> 15:37.719
-What, still no table?
-No, they wouldn't seat us

15:37.762 --> 15:39.416
till our whole party's here.

15:39.460 --> 15:40.852
-Geez.
-Yeah.

15:40.896 --> 15:42.115
Why didn't you tell them
I was in the bathroom?

15:42.158 --> 15:43.290
Well, 'cause you weren't
in the bathroom.

15:43.333 --> 15:45.727
Okay, here, Beth.
Before I forget,

15:45.770 --> 15:47.555
I made you some prints
from the other day.

15:47.598 --> 15:49.992
-Oh, wow. Thanks.
-Yeah.

15:50.036 --> 15:53.213
BETH:
Aw, look at Ellie's little face.

15:53.256 --> 15:55.998
It's crazy how much she looks
like the both of you.

15:56.042 --> 15:57.652
So, what's this Marco tells us,

15:57.695 --> 16:00.481
-you're moving to Wyoming?
-[mutters]

16:00.524 --> 16:02.396
Wyoming is where white people
go to get killed in the woods.

16:02.439 --> 16:03.527
-Yeah, a-all right.
-Yeah, we're not moving

16:03.571 --> 16:05.007
to Wyoming. Right, babe?

16:05.051 --> 16:06.574
Well, I mean,
anything's possible.

16:06.617 --> 16:07.923
-It's not possible.
-They just posted the job today.

16:07.967 --> 16:09.403
It's possible.

16:09.446 --> 16:11.100
-Would you work out there?
-MARCO: Of course.

16:11.144 --> 16:13.842
No. No. That's why we're not
seriously considering it.

16:13.885 --> 16:15.017
-MARCO: Yes.
-Besides, I think I just landed

16:15.061 --> 16:17.411
a really big new story, so...

16:17.454 --> 16:19.413
-Oh, that's great!
-Yeah.

16:19.456 --> 16:21.154
Wait, hon.

16:21.197 --> 16:22.807
For real this time?

16:22.851 --> 16:24.853
-What? Yes, for real this time.
-[Wes shushing]

16:24.896 --> 16:26.246
She's coming back.

16:26.289 --> 16:28.030
MARCO: Excuse me, miss,
we're all here.

16:28.074 --> 16:31.164
-Great. Right this way.
-[phone vibrating]

16:31.207 --> 16:33.079
All right!

16:34.689 --> 16:36.299
Oh, uh, you guys.

16:36.343 --> 16:37.518
This is gonna take one second.

16:37.561 --> 16:38.998
-No, Beth. No, no, Beth.
-One second.

16:39.041 --> 16:40.042
-One second.
-Beth. Beth, Beth, Beth.

16:40.086 --> 16:41.478
No, no, no. I'm so hungry.

16:43.132 --> 16:44.220
[door closes]

16:44.264 --> 16:46.657
She just went to the bathroom.

16:46.701 --> 16:48.268
AUTOMATED VOICE: ...may be
recorded and monitored.

16:48.311 --> 16:50.922
To accept this call,
press one or say yes.

16:50.966 --> 16:52.533
-Yes!
-Now.

16:52.576 --> 16:54.056
Yes, yes, yes.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.015
[phone line beeps]

16:56.058 --> 16:59.192
Hey, Toni. Are you there?

16:59.235 --> 17:00.802
TONI: Hey, what the hell
do you think you're doing?

17:00.845 --> 17:02.543
Staging a protest or something?

17:02.586 --> 17:04.327
Yeah, I sure am.

17:04.371 --> 17:06.764
I told them I won't leave
until they let us talk.

17:06.808 --> 17:08.418
You fucking fascists!

17:08.462 --> 17:09.550
I hope you eat your own shit!

17:09.593 --> 17:11.160
-Hey, look.
-Sorry, not you.

17:11.204 --> 17:13.032
COs are up my ass right now.

17:13.075 --> 17:15.208
If you want to help me,
leave me the hell alone.

17:15.251 --> 17:16.992
Toni, listen.

17:17.036 --> 17:18.950
I know the first time
we met was...

17:18.994 --> 17:21.431
was weird, and-and
I'm really sorry about that,

17:21.475 --> 17:22.563
but I...

17:22.606 --> 17:24.608
I've been diving into your case

17:24.652 --> 17:27.785
and, uh, and doing
my homework and...

17:27.829 --> 17:30.353
Listen,
I went to your house.

17:30.397 --> 17:33.008
-My house?
-Yeah.

17:33.052 --> 17:35.619
I met Wyatt,
and-and-and he told me a lot.

17:35.663 --> 17:38.231
I mean, Mile-High Linens?

17:38.274 --> 17:39.493
Yeah, it's a front.

17:39.536 --> 17:40.711
Yeah, obviously.

17:40.755 --> 17:42.365
And-and I found
a bunch of guns,

17:42.409 --> 17:44.411
clearly illegal guns.

17:44.454 --> 17:46.108
Yeah, he's a gun runner,
I told you.

17:46.152 --> 17:48.067
No, I know,
I know that you did.

17:48.110 --> 17:49.633
And I just...

17:49.677 --> 17:51.766
I just wanted to say
that I believe you.

17:51.809 --> 17:55.378
And your story,
I know how to tell it.

17:55.422 --> 17:58.860
Like, I know how to write it
so that you come off innocent.

17:58.903 --> 18:00.383
I aminnocent.

18:00.427 --> 18:01.776
Yes, but the-the world
doesn't know that.

18:01.819 --> 18:04.300
-Beth.
-Listen, I can do this.

18:04.344 --> 18:05.519
I know I can. [stammers]

18:05.562 --> 18:06.607
I really can do this.

18:06.650 --> 18:09.740
Beth, I gave the story to Tessa.

18:09.784 --> 18:11.220
[quietly]:
Fuck.

18:11.264 --> 18:13.962
I mean, she has
a bigger audience.

18:14.005 --> 18:15.616
[scoffs]

18:15.659 --> 18:17.531
How is a local
Denver news station

18:17.574 --> 18:20.055
a bigger audience
than the World Wide Web?

18:20.099 --> 18:22.884
And she has, uh,
more credibility.

18:22.927 --> 18:24.625
What did she tell you?

18:24.668 --> 18:26.105
That you got fired
from theChronicle

18:26.148 --> 18:28.933
'cause you misquoted people.

18:28.977 --> 18:31.153
-Put words in their mouths.
-No.

18:31.197 --> 18:33.068
Those were false allegations

18:33.112 --> 18:34.852
made by a lying scumbag.

18:34.896 --> 18:37.290
I was railroaded, okay?

18:37.333 --> 18:39.379
You of all people
should understand that.

18:39.422 --> 18:42.208
Toni, please.

18:42.251 --> 18:43.905
You're making the wrong choice.

18:43.948 --> 18:46.125
I know Tessa Flores.
She's vile.

18:46.168 --> 18:48.257
Yeah, but we watch her in here
every night.

18:48.301 --> 18:50.520
And when she speaks,
people listen.

18:50.564 --> 18:52.479
They believe.

18:54.742 --> 18:56.613
I just want to get back
with my baby girl,

18:56.657 --> 18:59.181
and Tessa is my best chance.

19:00.182 --> 19:02.141
So, that's it?

19:02.184 --> 19:03.968
Look, if you ever get
that tattoo,

19:04.012 --> 19:05.535
you let me know, all right?

19:05.579 --> 19:07.102
[line beeps, clicks]

19:07.146 --> 19:08.190
AUTOMATED VOICE:
Your call has ended.

19:08.234 --> 19:10.627
-Goodbye.
-[sighs]

19:11.976 --> 19:14.022
[sobs quietly]

19:35.261 --> 19:37.132
I stole these from a table.

19:37.176 --> 19:39.961
-Uh, they look untouched.
-Oh, thank you, Marco.

19:40.004 --> 19:41.180
[knocking on window]

19:41.223 --> 19:43.182
Work emergency!

19:43.225 --> 19:45.314
Sorry!

19:47.142 --> 19:49.057
Hi, excuse me.

19:49.100 --> 19:51.364
We'll just take a table
for three.

19:55.933 --> 19:59.241
TESSA: But in a country
where the press is

19:59.285 --> 20:01.504
under assault...

20:01.548 --> 20:05.116
and where media is no longer
synonymous with objectivity

20:05.160 --> 20:07.728
but instead with bias,

20:07.771 --> 20:10.557
we, all of us here
in this room,

20:10.600 --> 20:13.037
are this nation's last line
of defense

20:13.081 --> 20:16.780
against outrageous
manipulations of the truth.

20:16.824 --> 20:19.914
This award is
for all of you out there

20:19.957 --> 20:23.222
on the front lines,
speaking truth to power.

20:23.265 --> 20:26.834
Just know that I see you.

20:26.877 --> 20:30.446
I see you.

20:30.490 --> 20:32.709
Te veo.

20:32.753 --> 20:35.321
-[applause]
-Thank you.

20:41.283 --> 20:43.764
Hi, can I get a...

20:43.807 --> 20:46.070
Hello?

20:46.114 --> 20:48.334
Nice. Real nice.

20:48.377 --> 20:52.207
What are you doing here?

20:52.251 --> 20:55.689
Getting a drink.

20:55.732 --> 20:59.606
Tessa Flores taking home
the blue ribbon.

20:59.649 --> 21:01.129
How far we've fallen.

21:01.172 --> 21:03.262
Oh, well,
some of us didn't fall.

21:03.305 --> 21:05.307
-We were pushed.
-Don't.

21:05.351 --> 21:07.570
-Don't dredge it all back up.
-Just admit it.

21:07.614 --> 21:09.572
-I want my fish back.
-Why?

21:09.616 --> 21:11.226
So you can flush it
down the toilet

21:11.270 --> 21:13.576
as soon as it doesn't do
exactly what you want?

21:13.620 --> 21:15.752
I want my reputation back,
Ravi.

21:15.796 --> 21:17.711
I don't suppose you have that
sitting in a glass tank

21:17.754 --> 21:19.800
in your office?

21:19.843 --> 21:22.368
It's a tropical red swordtail,
Beth.

21:22.411 --> 21:24.544
It needs very specific food.

21:24.587 --> 21:26.981
I didn't take your fish.

21:28.199 --> 21:30.332
[sighs] Look, there's
an exotic pet store

21:30.376 --> 21:33.335
down on 26th and Cherry.
Ask for Pete.

21:35.946 --> 21:40.081
And remember, you're mad at me,
not the fish.

21:43.389 --> 21:46.261
Can I get a goddamn drink?!

21:46.305 --> 21:48.089
Please?

21:54.922 --> 21:58.055
TESSA:
Well, look at you, all...

21:58.099 --> 22:01.189
dolled up on my big night.

22:05.149 --> 22:07.761
Is this because of Toni?

22:07.804 --> 22:09.806
It's not my fault
she has brains in her head.

22:09.850 --> 22:11.852
You're just using her.

22:11.895 --> 22:14.855
I'm using her?
I'm using her, wow.

22:14.898 --> 22:16.683
What are you trying to do?
You're trying to...

22:16.726 --> 22:18.728
save her precious soul?

22:18.772 --> 22:21.383
She's not just
another piece of crime-porn

22:21.427 --> 22:22.906
to feed to
your perverted fanbase.

22:22.950 --> 22:25.561
Do not tell me
how to do my job.

22:25.605 --> 22:27.694
-You've had plenty of chances.
-Okay.

22:27.737 --> 22:30.871
-Okay?
-Fine. Fine.

22:30.914 --> 22:34.048
Just, please look
into Wyatt and the linens.

22:34.091 --> 22:35.919
Okay? There's more there.

22:35.963 --> 22:39.096
It could be a path
to reopening her case.

22:39.140 --> 22:41.490
Thank you, but I'd really
rather just skip

22:41.534 --> 22:45.842
the Beth Burgess master class
for now.

22:45.886 --> 22:48.367
Why don't you, uh, watch this
while I take a piss.

22:48.410 --> 22:51.761
Get reacquainted
with an old friend.

22:54.111 --> 22:56.244

Can you call 911?

What the fuck are youdoing?!

24:28.379 --> 24:30.120
You followed me.

24:30.164 --> 24:31.513
You tracked me down

24:31.557 --> 24:32.514
-and you followed me?
-Shut up, shut up.

24:32.558 --> 24:33.994
Well, guess what, George,

24:34.037 --> 24:34.516
you picked a real shit time
to follow me.

24:34.560 --> 24:36.257
Shut up.

24:36.300 --> 24:38.477
If you need a witness,
I saw the whole thing.

24:38.520 --> 24:39.695
She's clearly nuts.

24:39.739 --> 24:41.305
That's okay.
It's under control.

24:41.349 --> 24:43.090
Thank you, sir. I'm not nuts.
He's a criminal.

You really know how
to pick 'em, don't you, George?

that made you go,

I'll give her a hard time?"

-Lady,

-Oh, my God. Shut the fuck up.

I'm a husk! I'm a dried-up husk
of a useless woman!

-Why?

25:03.197 --> 25:04.590
-[shushes]
-Why?

25:04.633 --> 25:06.026
So I can spend my life
pumping out babies,

25:06.069 --> 25:08.507

in the Tetons?

25:08.550 --> 25:11.422
You go ahead and kill me.
Be doing me a favor.

-What you saw, you didn't see.

26:05.868 --> 26:08.479
Okay? You didn't see anything,

26:08.523 --> 26:11.787
you didn't hear anything,
because you were never there.

26:11.831 --> 26:13.397
All right?

26:13.441 --> 26:17.097
No more coming around,
no TV show, no cameras.

26:17.140 --> 26:19.403
We don't want any of it.

26:19.447 --> 26:21.188
All right?

26:22.145 --> 26:24.060
I need to hear you say
"All right."

26:24.104 --> 26:25.496
Well, first you tell me
not to talk

26:25.540 --> 26:26.410
-and now you want...
-Say "All right"!

26:26.454 --> 26:27.977
All right.

we've been over this.

27:28.124 --> 27:29.822
She's a vampire.

27:29.865 --> 27:32.651
She's gonna use you
for ratings, for attention,

27:32.694 --> 27:34.653
to ratchet up her own career.

27:34.696 --> 27:36.089
And then, when she gets
what she wants,

27:36.132 --> 27:37.525
she will pull her fangs
from your neck

27:37.568 --> 27:39.614
and let you rot in here.

27:39.658 --> 27:40.746
I'm trying to help you.

27:40.789 --> 27:42.530
Or are you trying
to help yourself?

27:42.573 --> 27:44.140
How do I know
you're not playing me?

27:44.184 --> 27:45.838
Well, how do I know
you're not a murderer?

-Okay, wait. Stop, stop.

What?
