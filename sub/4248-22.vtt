I OVERHEARD
THE TEACHERS TALKING,

11:27.144 --> 11:29.271
AND TONIGHT THEY'RE GOING
TO INITIATE JASON FULLY

11:29.355 --> 11:30.815
INTO THE SOCIETY.

11:30.898 --> 11:33.984
- SO WE'RE GOING BACK DOWN
TO THE CELLAR?

11:34.068 --> 11:37.071
- MISS MARTIN,
A WORD IN MY OFFICE.

11:46.038 --> 11:49.625
I KNOW THAT YOU KNOW

11:49.708 --> 11:53.629
THAT EMILY GRANT WAS IN FACT
SARAH FROBISHER-SMYTHE,

SO LET US NOT PRETEND,

I ALSO KNOW THAT YOU ARE AWARE
OF HER LINK TO THIS HOUSE.

12:05.182 --> 12:07.309

12:07.393 --> 12:09.645
SHE TOLD ME
SHE USED TO LIVE HERE.

12:09.728 --> 12:10.980
BUT WHO KNOWS?

12:11.063 --> 12:15.359
SHE WASN'T EXACTLY
SARAH CLARITY-SMYTHE.

12:15.443 --> 12:16.902
- LISTEN TO ME.

12:20.322 --> 12:22.825
RUFUS ZENO IS
AN EXTREMELY DANGEROUS MAN.

12:22.908 --> 12:26.287

FOR YOURSELF.

12:26.370 --> 12:27.788

12:31.792 --> 12:34.003

JOY'S DAD FOR SOME REASON,

SHE'S GONE INTO HIDING.

I'M JUST TRYING TO SHAKE
THE VICTOR OFF ME.

HIMSELF A ROBOT GIRLFRIEND

13:51.330 --> 13:54.583

- WE DON'T KNOW.

14:17.982 --> 14:20.150

IF YOU WANT TO.

16:15.974 --> 16:19.103
