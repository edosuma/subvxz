00:04.640 --> 00:05.801
Previously on "Power"...

00:05.960 --> 00:08.486
Once you get in bed with Stern,
it's near impossible to get out.

00:08.640 --> 00:11.120
But if you and I work hard,
we can beat him to the punch.

00:11.320 --> 00:13.402
Stern and Madeline
are getting a divorce.

00:13.560 --> 00:14.735
Why do you think he's been
out of the country so much?

00:14.760 --> 00:16.204
Hiding his assets.

00:16.360 --> 00:18.886
I just want you to know that
I'm here for you, you and the kids.

00:19.080 --> 00:22.050
I'm here to let you know the due date's
been pushed up, so now I'm pushing.

00:22.200 --> 00:25.170
Tommy here will contact you
about pickups. Let's get paid.

00:25.320 --> 00:28.369
Ghost and Tommy had a meeting,
the whole group. You weren't invited.

00:28.520 --> 00:30.363
I got something for you.
It's my grandmother's.

00:30.520 --> 00:33.842
If I don't prove James is Ghost,
Tommy's gonna take the hit.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.365
See you here tomorrow night.

00:35.520 --> 00:37.568
Your money, new ID,
and train ticket.

00:38.600 --> 00:40.284
The Feds called me in
for questioning.

00:40.440 --> 00:42.408
I can save us
by giving them Ghost.

00:42.600 --> 00:45.251
Are you out of your fucking mind?
Holly!

00:45.440 --> 00:47.442
Angela is close
to arresting Tommy.

00:47.600 --> 00:49.489
She loves you,
so she will protect you.

00:49.640 --> 00:52.769
You keep fucking that bitch

you need to control her body.

a shot at staying out of jail.

03:16.360 --> 03:18.488
What am I saying?
Of course you're hitting it right.

03:18.640 --> 03:21.883
That was never your problem.
Thank you.

03:26.160 --> 03:28.891
Angela talked to Holly.

03:29.040 --> 03:31.805
- What'd the bitch tell her?
- I don't know, but I'll find out.

03:31.960 --> 03:33.485
You better.

03:33.640 --> 03:35.608
Tasha, I could have come
to the house to talk.

03:35.760 --> 03:38.525
No, you couldn't have.

03:39.720 --> 03:41.882
You gonna talk to Holly?

03:42.040 --> 03:43.451
No need. She's gone.

03:43.600 --> 03:45.648
I need to find out
if she told Tommy anything.

03:45.800 --> 03:47.680
With her out of the picture,
he's unpredictable.

03:47.760 --> 03:50.491
Got Lobos collecting any day now,
Stern's up my ass...

03:50.640 --> 03:54.281
I asked for my bacon crispy.
These people don't listen.

04:01.080 --> 04:03.082
Look, Lobos I get.

04:03.240 --> 04:04.730
But after we pay him,

04:04.880 --> 04:07.884
we still got
the biggest problem... Angela.

04:08.040 --> 04:10.566
And you keeping her
happy enough not to arrest you.

04:10.720 --> 04:12.324
Angela isn't that simple, Tasha.

04:12.520 --> 04:14.760
Great sex ain't gonna keep her
from thinking for herself.

04:16.279 --> 04:19.204
Then you need to outthink her,

Ghost. What's up, kid?

06:04.280 --> 06:07.523
- What's up, man?
- Just about to go on a run.

06:07.720 --> 06:09.484

- Dre.

06:10.480 --> 06:13.051

You had a rough night?

06:36.640 --> 06:38.005

06:40.040 --> 06:43.840
Not even, man.
I'm... I'm a hunnerd.

06:44.000 --> 06:45.206
- All right. Okay.
- For real.

06:45.360 --> 06:47.160
Nah, but for real,
I gotta... I gotta head out

06:47.275 --> 06:48.765
to this meeting,
meet up with Dre.

06:48.915 --> 06:51.365
You know,
let him know that the...

06:51.520 --> 06:52.885
schedule's been moved up.

06:53.040 --> 06:54.804
Why don't you let me
handle that?

06:54.960 --> 06:57.281
We got Lobos and a whole lot
of other big shit coming up.

06:57.440 --> 06:59.681
I need your head right.

07:03.440 --> 07:05.681
- Thank you.
- Always.

07:09.280 --> 07:10.611
Clean up a bit.

07:10.760 --> 07:13.604
Fuck you.

07:31.520 --> 07:33.522
Thomas Patrick Egan.

07:33.720 --> 07:36.371
Never heard his name before.

07:36.520 --> 07:39.364
Not one of our usual suspects
this time, Ms. Valdes.

07:39.560 --> 07:41.688
Your Honor,
the government believes

07:41.840 --> 07:43.763
the affidavit before you
demonstrates

07:43.920 --> 07:46.002
sufficient probable cause
for Mr. Egan's arrest.

07:46.160 --> 07:47.525
May I question my witness,

07:47.680 --> 07:49.603
Special Agent Gregory Knox,

07:49.760 --> 07:52.366
the lead investigator
on our Felipe Lobos task force?

07:52.520 --> 07:54.522
Proceed. I'm all ears.

07:57.320 --> 07:59.891
Agent Knox, who is Thomas Egan

08:00.080 --> 08:03.129
and what is his relationship
to the subject under investigation?

08:03.280 --> 08:05.009
We believe Thomas Patrick Egan

08:05.160 --> 08:06.810
is Lobos' New York distributor

08:07.000 --> 08:09.048
known on the street as "Ghost."

08:09.200 --> 08:11.248
Our goal is to apprehend Egan

08:11.400 --> 08:13.926
and pressure him
to testify against Lobos.

08:14.080 --> 08:16.526
We have strong evidence
to support that Mr. Egan

08:16.720 --> 08:18.051
is responsible for the killing

08:18.200 --> 08:19.884
of a confidential informant,
Nomar Arcielo,

08:20.040 --> 08:23.010
who was working for us
within Egan's network.

08:24.360 --> 08:26.124
We believe Egan
discovered Arcielo

08:26.280 --> 08:28.521
was working for us
and killed him.

08:32.320 --> 08:35.289
Agent Knox, what was Arcielo's
dying declaration?

08:45.120 --> 08:47.327
He said Ghost was
the man that stabbed him.

08:47.480 --> 08:50.609
And if you want
an arrest warrant for Ghost,

08:50.800 --> 08:53.610
I'll sign one right now,
but what exactly is your evidence

08:53.800 --> 08:56.371
that Thomas Patrick Egan
is this Ghost?

08:56.520 --> 08:59.444
His car near the scene
of a murder?

08:59.640 --> 09:01.130
A voice on a tape?

09:01.280 --> 09:04.966
Any photographs to prove
that Egan was actually driving his car

09:05.120 --> 09:07.487
at the time of its location
at the Ruiz hideout?

09:07.640 --> 09:10.041
No, Your Honor, but the frequency
of these occurrences

09:10.160 --> 09:11.720
leads us to believe
there is no doubt...

09:11.745 --> 09:12.680
Were his fingerprints

09:12.840 --> 09:15.684
at the scene of the murder
of Nomar Arcielo?

09:15.840 --> 09:17.763
- Blood, DNA of any kind?
- No.

09:17.920 --> 09:19.640
Your Honor, there's enough
in this affidavit

09:19.665 --> 09:22.484
to grant us a warrant.
It's just an arrest, not a trial.

09:22.640 --> 09:26.361
I am fully aware of the government's
burden here, Ms. Valdes.

09:26.520 --> 09:28.170
The question is, are you?

09:29.520 --> 09:31.363
Do you have a witness

09:31.520 --> 09:33.727
who can prove Egan is Ghost

09:33.920 --> 09:36.969
or that Ghost exists at all?

09:39.640 --> 09:41.210
I'll watch Egan,
see what I can find.

09:41.360 --> 09:45.251
As for a witness, all we have
is Egan's girlfriend, Holly Weaver.

09:45.400 --> 09:47.801
Unfortunately, when
the Ohio warrant vanished,

09:47.960 --> 09:49.689
our leverage against her
went with it.

09:49.840 --> 09:51.569
You saw her, Greg.
You know she won't flip.

09:51.720 --> 09:53.404
I also know you're
still talking to her.

09:53.560 --> 09:55.847
You heard Schepisi.

09:56.000 --> 09:57.923
Only Holly can get us
what we need.

09:59.600 --> 10:03.207
- I'll find her.
- Good. I'll stay on Egan.

10:03.360 --> 10:05.249
Who knows? Maybe he'll slip up.

10:08.200 --> 10:11.090
Holly Elizabeth Weaver.

10:11.240 --> 10:14.449
Age is 25. Eyes... blue.

10:14.600 --> 10:15.965
Hair is red.

10:16.120 --> 10:18.964
Is she considered to be
armed or dangerous?

10:19.120 --> 10:21.487
- No, not armed.
- Good.

10:21.680 --> 10:24.251
Not dangerous,
if you don't count her mouth.

10:24.400 --> 10:26.243
Hey, didn't we look
for this girl before?

10:26.400 --> 10:28.368
I requested a trace on her cell.

10:28.560 --> 10:30.210
Right. It was in
a garbage can somewhere.

10:30.360 --> 10:32.647
And you think
this girl's still alive?

10:32.800 --> 10:34.484
I got information
that she left town.

10:34.640 --> 10:37.120
If she is out there,
we will find her.

10:37.320 --> 10:39.129
Call me as soon
as you get anything.

10:39.320 --> 10:40.651
You got it.

11:01.520 --> 11:04.490
Stay in the car, Shawn.

11:04.680 --> 11:07.286
Finally get to meet the man.

11:07.440 --> 11:10.762
- He left you in charge, right?
- Yeah.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.968
Good. I'm gonna need that money
sooner than later.

11:13.120 --> 11:14.724
- You can handle that?
- Shit.

11:14.880 --> 11:17.565
Gonna leave me broker than
a motherfucker, but you the boss.

11:17.720 --> 11:19.768
We play by your rules.

11:19.920 --> 11:22.764
Let's walk, man.
How you know Special K?

11:22.920 --> 11:24.649
I met him on the inside.

11:24.800 --> 11:26.400
He was an old head,
you know what I mean?

11:26.549 --> 11:27.989
Kept his distance
from us youngsters,

11:28.014 --> 11:30.411
but when I got jumped...

11:30.560 --> 11:33.211
that motherfucker
was right there, man.

11:34.640 --> 11:36.642
He saved your life.

11:37.640 --> 11:40.120
He said y'all ran the streets
together, though.

11:40.280 --> 11:43.011
You didn't stay long.
You got out.

11:43.160 --> 11:46.243
You want to get out of the hood?

11:46.400 --> 11:48.368
I mean, doesn't everybody?

11:48.560 --> 11:50.130
Not Kanan.

11:50.280 --> 11:52.362
Offered him a job.
He said, "No, thanks."

11:52.560 --> 11:54.767
Went right back to them streets.

11:54.920 --> 11:56.843
Some people, you know,

11:57.000 --> 11:58.729
only believe
in what they can see.

12:00.840 --> 12:03.810
I can see you, and you
ain't from here no more.

12:07.640 --> 12:09.802
I got a little girl, you know.

12:09.960 --> 12:11.325
Would be good if she grew up

12:11.480 --> 12:13.050
and didn't remember
living here at all.

12:18.600 --> 12:21.080
You got ambition.

12:21.240 --> 12:23.402
No doubt.

12:34.840 --> 12:36.285
Hey, Tasha. What's up?

12:36.480 --> 12:39.802
- Shawn, are you alone?
- Yeah, for a minute. Why?

12:39.960 --> 12:42.167
I need to know if that woman
has ever been in the house.

12:42.360 --> 12:44.522
Angela? Nah,
I never took her there.

12:44.680 --> 12:47.206
Wait. She's been in the car?

12:47.360 --> 12:50.204
I guess you saying Kanan
can't teach me how to get out the hood.

12:50.360 --> 12:52.681
I'm saying he trusts you,
so he'll keep you close,

12:52.840 --> 12:54.251
tell you everything he's thinking.

12:54.400 --> 12:57.609
Nah. He don't tell me everything.

12:57.760 --> 12:59.250
He got somebody else for that.

13:02.600 --> 13:04.364
All right, bet.

13:04.520 --> 13:06.727
I'm gonna get you your money
when you come back.

13:23.280 --> 13:25.123
Have you ever
left her alone in the car?

13:25.320 --> 13:27.243
- No. Why?
- Are you sure?

13:27.400 --> 13:29.400
I know Ghost had you
driving her around everywhere.

13:29.425 --> 13:30.291
Shit, I gotta go.

13:30.440 --> 13:33.205
Okay, well, I need you
to bring that car by here

13:33.360 --> 13:35.089
as soon as you
take Ghost to Truth.

13:35.240 --> 13:36.969
Yeah, okay. I will.

13:46.600 --> 13:49.365
Goin' to the club now, Uncle G?

13:50.840 --> 13:52.120
We're almost done
with the house.

13:52.145 --> 13:53.804
Looking clean.

13:53.960 --> 13:55.530
No bugs or listening devices.

13:57.280 --> 13:58.327
Well...

13:58.520 --> 14:02.605
maybe you guys can
go grab some coffee

14:02.760 --> 14:05.923
and come back, because there's
one other place I need you to check.

14:06.080 --> 14:08.845
Sure. Guys.

14:20.720 --> 14:24.167
This fucking bitch again.

14:24.320 --> 14:27.324
Hey, yo, I think that car over there
has driven by twice already.

14:27.480 --> 14:28.481
- The blue one?
- Yeah.

14:28.640 --> 14:30.927
With the old lady driving?

14:31.080 --> 14:33.651
Come on, dawg. You tripping.
Relax.

14:35.080 --> 14:37.321
Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're right.

14:42.320 --> 14:44.368
I ain't never processed
this much money in my life,

14:44.520 --> 14:45.760
and now they want to move it?

14:45.920 --> 14:49.845
It's just been a little wild.
Keep your mouth shut, though.

14:50.000 --> 14:54.369
You don't want to end up
on the wrong side of this motherfucker.

14:54.520 --> 14:56.615
Look, now, we never had a problem
with the Wash and Fold before.

14:56.640 --> 14:58.735
What makes you think we gotta move
all the money out of here right now?

14:58.760 --> 15:00.125
- Call it a hunch.
- All at once?

15:00.280 --> 15:03.360
I'm just thinking it's probably smarter
if you move it a little bit at a time.

15:03.385 --> 15:05.964
I ain't paying you to think.
We gotta get this shit out of here.

15:06.120 --> 15:09.329
Split it up, get all our eggs
out of one basket.

15:23.000 --> 15:26.129
Hey. There you are.

15:26.320 --> 15:30.530
Look...
What are you doing over there?

15:30.680 --> 15:32.284
Used to be my office, Kantos.

15:32.440 --> 15:34.640
Just needed something I left
in what used to be my desk.

15:34.720 --> 15:38.088
All right.

15:38.240 --> 15:40.600
Anyway, listen, the other night
when we had a couple drinks,

15:40.640 --> 15:42.404
I was way out of line.

15:42.560 --> 15:44.880
I really shouldn't have been
talking about Stern's divorce.

15:44.905 --> 15:47.404
- Doesn't affect me one way or another.
- Still, I...

15:47.560 --> 15:51.326
It's a private matter, right?
Don't worry.

15:51.480 --> 15:56.088
I won't blow you up
with your boss.

15:56.240 --> 15:58.402
- Thanks.
- You got it.

16:00.000 --> 16:02.048
I'm gonna work on the deposits.

16:02.200 --> 16:03.565
Here's my time card, James.

16:03.720 --> 16:04.926
- Thank you.
- Hey, Dominique.

16:05.080 --> 16:07.048
You change your hair?

16:07.200 --> 16:09.089
You look... good.

16:09.240 --> 16:11.607
Thanks.

16:24.080 --> 16:26.200
- All right, perfect.
- Just a signature's all I need.

16:26.225 --> 16:27.842
All right. Well, thank you.

16:28.000 --> 16:29.286
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

16:29.440 --> 16:31.681
Oh, Shawn, can you
give him your keys?

16:35.760 --> 16:37.205
Hey, what's going on?

16:37.360 --> 16:39.240
What, you think Angela
put something in the car?

16:39.265 --> 16:40.565
Why would she do that?

16:40.720 --> 16:42.722
I was hoping she left
something behind,

16:42.880 --> 16:45.167
proof that she and Ghost are fucking.
I might need it.

16:47.160 --> 16:49.288
You can't tell Ghost
any of this, okay?

16:49.480 --> 16:52.211
You can't tell him anything that I do,
even if he asks directly.

16:52.400 --> 16:55.802
Tasha... you can trust me.

16:56.800 --> 16:59.849
Okay, if we're gonna do this,
we need to be very careful.

17:00.000 --> 17:02.765
Anything that happens between us,
you have to keep it a secret.

17:02.920 --> 17:06.560
- You cannot make a mistake.
- I won't make a mistake.

17:08.640 --> 17:12.087
Tasha, I'm ready to do
whatever it takes to be with you.

17:18.440 --> 17:20.169
Good.

17:33.720 --> 17:36.200
Come on, move your fucking feet.

17:36.360 --> 17:38.761
Let's go. Let's go. Let's go.

18:04.720 --> 18:07.371
Hey, J, you ever get molested
in one of these things?

18:07.560 --> 18:11.042
- Shit, I try to block that day out.
- I do, too, but I can't.

18:11.200 --> 18:13.123
Father Maloney's hands,
they were so soft.

18:20.960 --> 18:22.041
Fuck.

18:24.080 --> 18:25.730
What do you want me to do, man?

18:25.880 --> 18:28.040
Well, you ain't gonna outrun 'em
in this piece of shit.

18:28.065 --> 18:29.724
And none of y'all strapped?

18:29.920 --> 18:33.208
No? Good. Pull over.

18:35.960 --> 18:40.249
Yo, V... smile, motherfucker.
Don't give him a reason to shoot.

18:45.600 --> 18:47.762
You ever hear
of "probable cause," Officer?

18:47.920 --> 18:50.924
Come on, T, don't fuck with the officer.
He's got plenty of probable cause.

18:51.080 --> 18:53.003
- And what's that?
- "DWB."

18:53.160 --> 18:55.925
"Driving while black,"
on account of my friend over there.

18:56.080 --> 18:59.368
Sorry, Officer.
I'll never drive while black again.

18:59.520 --> 19:00.646
Cute.

19:00.800 --> 19:02.529
But this van was identified

19:02.680 --> 19:04.520
as a vehicle used
in the commission of a crime.

19:04.545 --> 19:07.196
I will be searching it.

19:17.440 --> 19:21.365
Beautiful. You gonna arrest us
for having dirty drawers, or can we go?

20:03.000 --> 20:04.331
Well, what's up, James?

20:04.480 --> 20:07.370
Any news on our resident
cocksucker Stern?

20:07.520 --> 20:08.920
The cocksucker's
out of the country,

20:09.040 --> 20:11.321
but I want to ask you a question.
You keep your own books,

20:11.346 --> 20:14.164
- do your own accounting?
- Not since I signed up for the team.

20:14.320 --> 20:17.369
Stern sent this asshole over
to handle all of that.

20:17.520 --> 20:19.363
I'm blackballed
from my own affairs.

20:19.520 --> 20:21.727
Same fucking problem here,

20:21.880 --> 20:24.201
except the asshole in question
used to work for me.

20:24.360 --> 20:26.169
I'm totally shut out, man.

20:26.320 --> 20:28.400
I think there's something
they don't want us to know.

20:28.596 --> 20:30.276
You ever heard of something
called Ravenna?

20:30.436 --> 20:33.328
No, can't say that I have.

20:33.480 --> 20:36.290
Well, that name's been popping up
everywhere over here.

20:36.440 --> 20:40.729
My lease says "Ravenna Holdings"
all of a sudden,

20:40.920 --> 20:43.605
but I haven't met one soul
this whole time from Ravenna,

20:43.800 --> 20:46.770
- not even a lawyer.
- I'll look into it, Lee.

20:46.920 --> 20:50.766
You made me a promise, James.
You better follow through.

20:52.840 --> 20:54.968
Have a good night, man.

20:55.960 --> 20:58.691
Come in.

20:58.840 --> 21:01.605
Hey. We're running low
on bottles of Effen.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.649
I need to go to the storeroom
to restock,

21:03.800 --> 21:06.963
- thought maybe you could help.
- Where's James?

21:07.160 --> 21:08.810
It's his job to keep
the liquor stocked.

21:08.960 --> 21:13.329
He's really busy,
so I thought I'd ask the boss.

A good divorce attorney
is part forensic accountant,

22:20.520 --> 22:22.841
part psychologist,
and part attack dog.

22:23.000 --> 22:24.809
You trust me with your secrets,

22:24.960 --> 22:27.850
and I promise to protect
your interests with my dying breath.

22:28.000 --> 22:31.288
- You make that speech a lot?
- It's usually effective.

22:31.440 --> 22:33.169
Not on you?

22:34.480 --> 22:37.848
I got a pretty fine-tuned
bullshit detector.

22:39.120 --> 22:41.646
Well, at least, I thought I did.

22:41.800 --> 22:44.041
I looked over the documents
you sent.

22:44.200 --> 22:45.850
Is this everything?

22:46.000 --> 22:47.968
Yeah, that's it...

22:48.120 --> 22:51.966
Our wills, trust funds
for the kids, our prenup.

22:52.120 --> 22:54.964
You know what's in here.
If you instigate the divorce,

22:55.120 --> 22:57.168
you leave with nothing.

22:58.560 --> 23:02.565
I know. That's why I hired you.

23:02.720 --> 23:05.530
I'm sure you think I was
pretty stupid to sign it.

23:06.520 --> 23:10.047
When you signed this,
you were 20 years old, in love.

23:10.240 --> 23:12.811
You had no idea
what you were doing.

23:12.960 --> 23:15.122
But I have to admit
this kind of agreement

23:15.280 --> 23:17.328
can be hard to break.

23:18.840 --> 23:22.162
You said your husband
was living outside the home?

23:24.000 --> 23:25.445
Yeah, I kicked him out.

23:27.360 --> 23:29.203
There are some women
in your situation

23:29.360 --> 23:32.250
who choose to work
within the marriage.

23:32.400 --> 23:34.721
That might be the better option
for you.

23:34.880 --> 23:36.644
You mean stay married to him?

23:36.800 --> 23:39.963
You live completely
separate lives,

23:40.120 --> 23:43.203
but you keep the joint bank account
and the status.

23:43.400 --> 23:45.482
As long as he lets you
keep the family residence,

23:45.640 --> 23:47.722
it can work out.

23:50.160 --> 23:54.165
If you hire me, Tasha,
I will try to break this prenup,

23:54.320 --> 23:56.129
but I can't make any guarantees.

23:56.280 --> 23:59.762
If you pursue this divorce,
you could end up with nothing.

24:09.080 --> 24:10.525
Ange.

24:10.680 --> 24:12.170
You found something that quick?

24:12.320 --> 24:14.368
Well, actually, it's about
what I didn't get.

24:14.520 --> 24:18.445
Ms. Holly Elizabeth Weaver
hasn't used a credit card.

24:18.640 --> 24:20.529
She hasn't made
an ATM withdrawal

24:20.680 --> 24:24.127
or so much as bought a box
of tampons in the past 36 hours.

24:24.280 --> 24:25.930
She hasn't crossed
the border into Canada.

24:26.080 --> 24:27.411
She hasn't boarded a plane.

24:27.560 --> 24:29.528
Maybe her purse got stolen.

24:29.680 --> 24:32.520
If so, she didn't call the bank
or the credit card company to report it.

24:32.545 --> 24:33.803
She either ditched her purse,

24:33.960 --> 24:37.328
or she is somewhere
lotioning up for Buffalo Bill.

24:38.960 --> 24:40.086
- Or...
- She's dead.

24:40.240 --> 24:42.163
At her age, most likely.

24:43.720 --> 24:46.041
Ange, are you okay?

24:48.640 --> 24:50.529
Yeah. She is...

24:52.400 --> 24:55.051
was an important witness,
that's all.

24:55.200 --> 24:57.885
Who was she supposed to be
testifying against?

25:15.720 --> 25:19.930
- Hey, you're a pleasant surprise.
- We need to talk. Now.

25:20.120 --> 25:21.531
And you're upset.

25:21.680 --> 25:24.490
Sit down.
I need to see your eyes.

25:24.640 --> 25:27.120
- What's this about?
- I'm gonna show you.

25:27.280 --> 25:29.567
Sit down.

25:36.760 --> 25:39.411
- I know Holly Weaver's dead, Jamie.
- Angie, I...

25:39.560 --> 25:41.369
I know
what you told me... a lie...

25:41.560 --> 25:43.562
So that Tommy
could get away with murder.

25:43.720 --> 25:45.085
- She left town.
- Right.

25:45.240 --> 25:46.480
To a magical place

25:46.640 --> 25:48.449
where ATMs
and credit cards don't exist.

25:48.600 --> 25:51.888
Even if you did give her money,
there'd still be a trail-

25:52.040 --> 25:54.486
a hotel receipt, a plane ticket,
something.

25:54.640 --> 25:59.282
I know why he did it.
Fuck it, I'm probably responsible.

26:00.320 --> 26:04.484
He killed her because I asked her
to testify against him.

26:04.640 --> 26:08.008
I asked her
to testify about this.

26:11.680 --> 26:13.728
And this.

26:18.120 --> 26:19.920
You think Tommy
had something to do with this?

26:19.960 --> 26:22.611
Tommy killed her because
I asked her to explain

26:22.760 --> 26:24.842
what his car was doing here...

26:25.000 --> 26:26.570
and here.

26:28.440 --> 26:30.044
You asked Holly
to testify against Tommy?

26:30.200 --> 26:32.089
You wouldn't testify
against him,

26:32.240 --> 26:33.890
so I asked her.

26:34.040 --> 26:35.929
Did you think I was
gonna give up, Jamie?

26:36.080 --> 26:38.924
You know me better than that.

26:39.080 --> 26:42.004
I asked her to testify about this.

26:50.640 --> 26:52.688
I knew this kid
from the neighborhood.

26:52.880 --> 26:54.325
Rolla, right?

26:56.040 --> 26:57.849
Yeah, Rolla.

26:58.000 --> 27:00.162
He was killed the night
of the big snowstorm

27:00.320 --> 27:02.721
a couple of months ago.
How did you know him?

27:02.880 --> 27:04.560
If you hadn't left
the neighborhood, Angie,

27:04.709 --> 27:06.074
you would have known him, too.

27:06.229 --> 27:08.645
He was a good kid. It's a shame.

27:08.800 --> 27:11.485
Tommy wouldn't have done that.
He wouldn't have done any of it,

27:11.640 --> 27:14.166
- and he didn't kill Holly.
- Bullshit.

27:14.360 --> 27:18.570
You know he did it, or you know
who he asked to do it for him.

27:18.720 --> 27:20.848
Tell me, Jamie.

27:21.000 --> 27:24.402
Tell me right now what the fuck
happened to Holly Weaver.

27:24.560 --> 27:26.961
Tell me right now,
or I'm gonna walk out of here,

27:27.160 --> 27:29.242
and you're never
gonna see me again.

27:37.640 --> 27:39.768
Fine.

27:47.800 --> 27:49.848
Goodbye, Jamie.

28:08.080 --> 28:09.889
Angie, wait.

28:10.080 --> 28:13.721
I wasn't lying,
and I can prove it.

28:16.400 --> 28:18.880
When Holly left town,
she left with a fake ID.

28:19.040 --> 28:20.610
That's why you can't find her.

28:20.800 --> 28:22.600
She's traveling under the name
"Monica Moore."

28:26.120 --> 28:28.487
- Are you serious?
- I'm a club owner, Angie.

28:28.680 --> 28:29.920
I can get a fake ID.

28:30.080 --> 28:31.840
She wanted to disappear,
so I made it happen.

28:31.920 --> 28:33.968
But now you'll find her,
I promise.

28:34.120 --> 28:36.088
Holly's alive.

29:17.320 --> 29:19.368
Okay, so then
what's the problem?

29:21.840 --> 29:24.446
What did the divorce
attorney say?

29:27.000 --> 29:30.846
She says that she's not sure
she can break my prenup.

29:31.000 --> 29:33.844
She reminded me
that if I leave Ghost,

29:34.040 --> 29:35.405
I could end up with nothing.

29:35.560 --> 29:37.562
But if you leave him,
then we'll be together.

29:37.720 --> 29:39.165
I'll take care of you.

31:46.920 --> 31:48.445
I'm not looking
for a smoke, Ghost.

31:48.600 --> 31:51.649
I'm looking for the time
and place of your Lobos meet.

31:51.840 --> 31:55.686
That's what I meant when I said
I wanted a seat at the table.

31:55.840 --> 31:59.208
You're right, Lobos and I did not
get along, but that doesn't mean

31:59.360 --> 32:02.125
he should be unaware of my
importance to the organization.

32:02.280 --> 32:03.884
He should learn some respect.

32:04.040 --> 32:06.884
I don't have a time nor a place.

32:07.040 --> 32:09.771
Jefe hasn't given me
any details.

32:09.920 --> 32:13.811
But when I know, you know.

32:13.960 --> 32:16.281
I plan to hold you to that.

32:24.080 --> 32:26.003
We're good.

32:41.600 --> 32:42.806
- It all there?
- Yeah.

32:42.960 --> 32:45.440
But I ain't gonna bullshit you, man.
This turnaround hurt.

32:45.600 --> 32:47.480
- I'm gonna need that re-up soon.
- I hear that.

32:47.600 --> 32:49.602
I got it, all right?

32:51.840 --> 32:53.285
Later.

32:55.120 --> 32:57.521
Yo, so where do
we take this drop to?

32:57.680 --> 32:59.489
To the fucking Wash and Fold.
What you mean?

32:59.640 --> 33:02.041
Nah, we bugged out of that.

33:02.200 --> 33:04.441
We moved all the money
out of the Wash and Fold?

33:04.600 --> 33:06.489
- Why?
- Tommy had a hunch.

33:06.640 --> 33:10.611
He wasn't wrong either.
Our van got searched on the way out.

33:10.800 --> 33:13.610
- We didn't have shit in it, but still.
- Sure it wasn't a random stop?

33:13.800 --> 33:15.962
Cops went straight for the bags.

33:17.160 --> 33:19.845
Where's the money now?

33:20.000 --> 33:22.162
It's in transit.

33:25.320 --> 33:28.563
Good work, J. Let's go.

33:30.800 --> 33:32.404
I need you to try again.

33:32.560 --> 33:35.040
Use the same picture,
same height, same weight,

33:35.240 --> 33:36.969
but this time, try the name
"Monica Moore."

33:37.160 --> 33:38.600
Monica Moore
is a really common name.

33:38.680 --> 33:40.648
I mean, this could take a while.

33:40.800 --> 33:43.640
Call me when you get something,
even if it's in the middle of the night.

33:43.665 --> 33:45.528
I don't care.
Wake me the fuck up.

33:45.680 --> 33:48.251
Hey, Ghost! Come here.

33:48.400 --> 33:50.687
- Get over here.
- Where the hell you been?

33:50.880 --> 33:53.645
- You ducking my calls?
- No. I can't talk on the phone.

33:53.840 --> 33:56.240
- Tommy, where are we going?
- They could be listening to us.

33:56.265 --> 33:58.487
- They who?
- No, they're closing in on us,

33:58.680 --> 34:00.280
and it's too fucking late
to go anywhere.

34:00.400 --> 34:03.324
They know where we keep our money.
We got pulled over today for no reason.

34:03.480 --> 34:05.005
The cop went through our bags.

34:05.160 --> 34:07.162
They didn't find shit,
but he knew where to look.

34:07.320 --> 34:10.164
Tommy, I told you I had
all of this under control, didn't I?

34:10.320 --> 34:12.846
You moving money around
and shit puts us more at risk.

34:13.000 --> 34:14.411
You gotta keep
your head low, man.

34:14.560 --> 34:16.164
We get the money
from our primeras.

34:16.360 --> 34:18.283
We turn it over to Lobos,
then we have options.

34:18.440 --> 34:20.120
Angela is way closer
than you think, Ghost.

34:20.145 --> 34:21.724
Way closer. You can't stop her.

34:21.880 --> 34:24.610
You and I own
the Wash and Fold legally.

34:24.760 --> 34:26.603
Operative fucking word, legally.

34:26.760 --> 34:28.639
Public record.
You look it up in the phone book,

34:28.719 --> 34:30.085
there it is, "Wash and Fold."

34:30.239 --> 34:32.000
If the Feds show up
at the goddamn warehouse,

34:32.120 --> 34:33.610
then we have a fucking problem.

34:33.800 --> 34:35.802
Oh, yeah.

34:35.960 --> 34:37.495
Angela ain't got proof of who we are
or what the fuck we do.

34:37.520 --> 34:39.362
If she did, we'd be arrested
a long time ago.

34:39.520 --> 34:42.763
We gotta just stay cool, man,
act like nothing happened.

34:42.920 --> 34:45.366
Trust me. I got a plan.
It'll all work out.

34:45.560 --> 34:48.245
I trust you.
It's her I don't trust.

34:48.400 --> 34:50.447
She's the problem, G.

34:50.600 --> 34:53.560
You been fucking her this whole time,
telling her you're gonna leave Tasha.

34:53.585 --> 34:56.123
Well, you did. You left Tasha.
And she's still coming after us.

34:56.320 --> 34:57.970
Don't you get it?
When you gonna realize

34:58.120 --> 34:59.960
you ain't in control
of this situation no more?

35:00.040 --> 35:04.568
No plan of yours is gonna stop her
till she gets what she fucking wants.

35:15.440 --> 35:17.568
Tasha, I need to see you.
It's an emergency.

35:20.600 --> 35:21.965
Where are the kids?

35:22.120 --> 35:24.771
You said it was an emergency,
so I sent them out with Mama.

35:24.920 --> 35:26.160
We got a problem with Tommy.

35:26.320 --> 35:28.243
I think he's gonna
try to kill Angela.

35:28.400 --> 35:30.687
- Good!
- I'm serious. Come on.

35:30.840 --> 35:34.401
Tasha, he'll listen to you.
I need you to get him under control.

35:34.560 --> 35:36.767
I know what I'm
asking you to do.

35:36.920 --> 35:38.888
You have no idea.

35:41.120 --> 35:44.283
I was a good wife. I helped you.

35:44.440 --> 35:46.169
I loved you.

35:46.320 --> 35:47.651
I trusted you.

35:47.800 --> 35:49.404
So I signed a piece of paper

35:49.560 --> 35:51.608
that said if I leave you,
I don't get a dime.

35:51.760 --> 35:53.524
Why are you looking
at our prenup again?

35:53.680 --> 35:55.842
Why the fuck do you think?

35:59.800 --> 36:03.486
I couldn't risk a divorce.
You knew everything.

36:03.680 --> 36:05.011
You know everything.

36:05.160 --> 36:07.720
As long as you remain my wife,
then you can't testify against me.

36:07.800 --> 36:10.371
Testify against you?
I wouldn't do that to the kids.

36:10.560 --> 36:12.847
I didn't want
to give you a choice.

36:13.000 --> 36:15.890
So now you got us all hooked
into you and your shit.

36:17.240 --> 36:18.924
So if you go down,
we all go down.

36:19.080 --> 36:22.084
- Fuck you, Ghost.
- I got a plan, Tasha, okay?

36:22.280 --> 36:24.120
But Angela's gotta remain alive
for it to work.

36:24.240 --> 36:25.765
If Tommy kills Angela,

36:25.920 --> 36:28.605
then the entire force of the FBI
comes raining down on us.

36:28.760 --> 36:31.240
We lose everything,
you lose everything,

36:31.400 --> 36:32.970
the children lose everything.

36:34.280 --> 36:36.601
Look around, Tash.

36:36.760 --> 36:38.205
All of it, gone.

36:40.280 --> 36:42.248
Or you can trust me

36:42.400 --> 36:44.562
and help me see this
through to the end.

37:02.360 --> 37:03.646
You got something?

37:03.800 --> 37:05.689
So a redheaded Monica Moore

37:05.840 --> 37:07.880
just checked into a seedy motel
outside of Scranton.

37:07.905 --> 37:10.360
- Scranton?
- The girl matches the description.

37:10.520 --> 37:12.682
- Text me the address.
- Okay. Bye.

37:47.400 --> 37:49.209
- Tommy.
- What the fuck are you doing?

37:49.360 --> 37:51.124
I know what you're
about to do, okay?

37:51.280 --> 37:53.089
Then you should let me do it,

37:53.240 --> 37:54.890
- you of all people.
- I know everything.

37:55.080 --> 37:56.969
As much as I want
this bitch dead, too,

37:57.120 --> 37:58.406
now is not the time.

37:58.560 --> 38:00.324
He send you?

38:00.480 --> 38:03.370
Yeah, but he was right
this time.

38:03.520 --> 38:07.525
Fucking Ghost. He's everywhere.

38:35.760 --> 38:37.569
Mrs. Stern.

38:37.720 --> 38:40.690
James. You can tell Simon

38:40.880 --> 38:42.928
I will in no way capitulate
to any of his demands.

38:43.080 --> 38:44.605
He wasted your time
sending you here.

38:44.800 --> 38:47.201
You don't understand.
I know how you feel.

38:47.360 --> 38:48.885
Excuse me?

38:49.040 --> 38:50.960
That's the most ridiculous thing
I've ever heard.

38:52.120 --> 38:53.485
You were young when you met him.

38:53.680 --> 38:55.284
He's not the man
you thought he was.

38:55.440 --> 38:57.886
You gave him your whole life,
and now he's abandoned you.

38:58.040 --> 39:01.442
- You want him to burn.
- So do I.

39:02.840 --> 39:04.171
What do you want?

39:04.360 --> 39:06.280
I have good reason to believe
that Simon has been

39:06.305 --> 39:08.009
skimming from the clubs,
hiding assets.

39:08.160 --> 39:11.243
And I don't have proof yet,
but I know he's working

39:11.400 --> 39:12.680
with an outside
company, Ravenna.

39:12.705 --> 39:14.648
Ravenna?

39:14.800 --> 39:17.565
That sick bastard.

39:17.720 --> 39:19.006
What is it?

39:19.160 --> 39:21.083
Our daughter's name.

39:21.240 --> 39:23.402
I didn't know you had kids.

39:23.560 --> 39:27.281
We don't. She died, 10 days old.

39:27.440 --> 39:29.090
I'm sorry.

39:29.240 --> 39:30.969
Ravenna's
not an outside company.

39:31.120 --> 39:32.929
That's Simon.
I can promise you that.

39:33.080 --> 39:35.160
Well, then he's hiding money
from you and properties.

39:35.280 --> 39:37.009
But that could also be a trick.

39:37.160 --> 39:38.855
I wouldn't put it past Simon
to send you here with this story.

39:38.880 --> 39:40.200
I wouldn't put it
past him either,

39:40.334 --> 39:41.574
but you should get your lawyers

39:41.599 --> 39:42.965
to check out what I'm saying...

39:43.120 --> 39:44.884
His travel out of the country,
bank accounts.

39:45.040 --> 39:47.042
If I'm wrong, no foul.

39:47.200 --> 39:49.009
But if I'm right...

39:49.160 --> 39:50.730
Well, if I'm right,

39:50.880 --> 39:53.201
you and I could
help each other out.

39:53.360 --> 39:54.521
Would you do that for me?

39:54.680 --> 39:56.170
For yourself?

40:07.200 --> 40:09.680
Nah, nah.

40:09.880 --> 40:12.281
I'm gonna call you back.

40:14.640 --> 40:17.166
- Give me the phone.
- Uncle G, I was just talking to my mom.

40:17.320 --> 40:18.685
You been acting like a punk kid,

40:18.840 --> 40:20.800
hanging up the phone
every time you see me coming.

40:20.825 --> 40:23.146
What the fuck
is going on, Shawn?

40:24.880 --> 40:27.201
Give me the fucking phone.

40:32.240 --> 40:34.686
Where's your father?
Where's Kanan?

40:34.840 --> 40:36.524
- I don't know.
- That's bullshit.

40:36.680 --> 40:38.170
You ain't never
kept a secret from me

40:38.320 --> 40:40.520
till that motherfucker got out of jail.
Now where is he?

40:40.545 --> 40:42.562
I honestly don't know, Uncle G.

40:42.720 --> 40:44.609
You tell him
if he doesn't show up

40:44.760 --> 40:46.489
or you can't make him show up,

40:46.640 --> 40:49.166
I don't have any use for you,
not for another fucking minute.

40:49.320 --> 40:51.561
I can't trust you.

40:51.760 --> 40:54.081
You understand what I'm saying?

40:55.680 --> 40:57.682
Take your fucking phone.

41:09.760 --> 41:11.603
You shoulda let me kill her.

41:11.760 --> 41:15.321
Nah, Ghost says that
he needs Angela alive

41:15.480 --> 41:19.201
for his plan to work.
But as soon as this is over,

41:19.360 --> 41:22.648
that bitch is catching a bullet...
From my gun, not yours.

41:22.800 --> 41:25.610
That is why I love you, T.

41:25.760 --> 41:28.411
You a stone-cold bitch!

41:29.960 --> 41:32.281
Hey-

41:32.440 --> 41:34.647
Here. Here.

41:34.840 --> 41:36.251
Buy yourself a drink.

41:36.400 --> 41:38.289
And mind your own
fucking "bidness."

41:43.320 --> 41:45.800
Holly could have
been like you, T.

41:45.960 --> 41:47.291
She had it in her.

41:47.480 --> 41:49.847
That's the first time
in my life I could, like,

41:50.000 --> 41:52.002
see down the road.

41:53.720 --> 41:56.041
Like a kid, with her.

42:05.680 --> 42:07.045
Stay right there.

42:07.200 --> 42:09.441
What you doing?

42:10.480 --> 42:12.881
Try not to look
like a sad puppy.

42:14.240 --> 42:16.163
Hi. You see my friend
over there?

42:16.320 --> 42:17.560
He just had his heart broken...

42:19.800 --> 42:21.928
Bartender, can I get
another round over here!

42:22.080 --> 42:23.923
- Yeah.
- Yeah, let's go.

42:28.800 --> 42:32.043
Tommy, I think
you've had a lot to drink.

42:33.520 --> 42:36.603
- Yeah?
- Meghan and Sarah here

42:36.760 --> 42:39.411

you get home safe.

fucking mutt with you.

44:07.200 --> 44:09.567
Get out of here.

No, no, no, no.
Come back. Come back.

44:12.800 --> 44:14.450
- Give me the dog.
- But...

44:14.600 --> 44:16.443
Get out of here.

44:37.240 --> 44:39.607
Who the fuck is it?

44:41.120 --> 44:44.249
I've got a gun! And herpes,

44:44.400 --> 44:46.846
so you should find
some other girl to mess with.

44:47.000 --> 44:50.607
Well, at least we both know
you don't have a gun, Holly.

44:53.200 --> 44:54.645
You've got the wrong room.

44:54.800 --> 44:57.406
Look, I can get the state troopers
to open the door,

44:57.560 --> 44:59.483
but I think you'd
rather just talk to me.

45:03.400 --> 45:05.289
How the fuck
did you find me here?

45:05.440 --> 45:07.249
You really fucked me, Holly.

45:07.400 --> 45:10.722
You fucked me first.
That's how I ended up here.

45:10.880 --> 45:13.770
What happened? Why'd you run?

45:24.840 --> 45:28.401
I didn't have a choice...
because of you.

45:28.560 --> 45:30.210
You told Tommy what I wanted?

45:30.360 --> 45:31.646
He asked me where I was

45:31.800 --> 45:33.723
the whole fucking day
you had me in custody.

45:33.880 --> 45:35.440
Couldn't come up
with a good enough lie.

45:35.520 --> 45:36.851
He threw me out.

45:37.040 --> 45:38.929
I was worried.
I thought you were dead.

45:39.080 --> 45:42.163
Well, I could have been,
thanks to you.

45:42.320 --> 45:43.845
I was lucky to get out of there

45:44.000 --> 45:45.760
before he put my head
through a fucking wall.

45:45.840 --> 45:47.410
You could have called me.

45:47.560 --> 45:49.847
You told me you wouldn't help me
without the gun,

45:50.000 --> 45:53.129
so I went to your boyfriend.
He helped me get away from Tommy.

45:53.280 --> 45:56.762
The fake-name thing was his idea,
in case Tommy looked for me.

46:00.240 --> 46:03.528
If James is Ghost,
why would he help you?

46:03.680 --> 46:05.444
Why would you
go to him for help?

46:07.480 --> 46:09.164
I lied.

46:09.320 --> 46:11.800
Excuse me?
You told me he was Ghost.

46:13.760 --> 46:17.287
You come to me with a story
about Tommy being a drug dealer.

46:17.440 --> 46:19.408
Looks like you have proof.
I don't know.

46:19.560 --> 46:22.404
You said you were looking
for someone named "Ghost."

46:23.800 --> 46:27.521
I recognized you.
I knew you knew James.

46:27.720 --> 46:31.361
When I said it, I saw your face.
You bought in.

46:31.520 --> 46:33.170
And then you wouldn't let it go,

46:33.320 --> 46:36.688
so I figured I could save Tommy
and save myself.

46:36.840 --> 46:39.605
Turns out I could
only save one of us.

46:39.760 --> 46:41.091
I pick me.

46:41.240 --> 46:43.971
So you're completely done
with Tommy?

46:45.320 --> 46:46.810
You don't care
what happens to him?

46:46.960 --> 46:50.089
No, I don't.

46:52.000 --> 46:56.050
So then tell me about his
relationship with Felipe Lobos.

46:56.200 --> 46:57.884
I know you know something.

47:13.000 --> 47:15.606
I'm not gonna tell you shit.

47:15.760 --> 47:17.967
Get the fuck out of here.
I never want to see you again.

47:18.120 --> 47:21.249
Okay. Well, if you
change your mind,

47:21.440 --> 47:25.126
you know where to find me.
Good luck, Holly.

47:25.320 --> 47:27.482
It's Monica now.

47:30.920 --> 47:32.445
Fuck.

47:34.880 --> 47:38.089
- She bought it.
- I heard everything.

47:38.240 --> 47:40.280
There's a Western Union
about a mile from the motel.

47:40.305 --> 47:41.161
Be there in an hour.

47:41.320 --> 47:45.041
I'm sending you enough
for you to disappear for good.

47:45.200 --> 47:46.645
Goodbye, Holly.

47:48.240 --> 47:50.163
Goodbye, Ghost.

48:24.920 --> 48:27.040
Seems like you made the wrong turn
somewhere, playboy.

48:27.065 --> 48:30.806
Yeah, well, I grew up around here,
all right? So don't forget that.

48:30.960 --> 48:32.371
Looks like you already have.

48:34.440 --> 48:36.647
Where's my father at, man?

48:36.800 --> 48:38.775
He ain't been answering my calls
and I know he's been talking to you.

48:38.800 --> 48:40.564
I ain't heard
from that nigga, man.

48:40.720 --> 48:43.001
Maybe he's done with New York
for a while. What's up, bro?

48:47.520 --> 48:49.761
Well, tell him that Lobos
is comin' into town, all right?

48:49.920 --> 48:52.321
Maybe that'll change his mind.

48:56.280 --> 49:00.365
♪ I've got the space,
I'm good now... ♪

49:02.040 --> 49:04.964
There she is. For you.

49:05.120 --> 49:06.451
Thanks.

49:06.600 --> 49:08.443
- Nice place.
- Thanks.

49:08.600 --> 49:10.841
I can see why Simon
wanted to take it from you.

49:12.680 --> 49:14.808
Your information checked out.

49:14.960 --> 49:16.720
With proof I can destroy him
in this divorce.

49:16.840 --> 49:19.525
- You said you had documentation?
- I will.

49:19.720 --> 49:22.320
I have to get some papers in Florida,
actually, some other places.

49:22.474 --> 49:24.074
May take a minute,
but I'll come through.

49:24.194 --> 49:28.284
I'll stall my attorneys.
And what do you want in exchange?

49:28.480 --> 49:29.766
Well, you said it.

49:29.920 --> 49:32.048
It's a nice place.

49:33.400 --> 49:35.767
It's my place.

49:35.920 --> 49:38.161
I want it back.

49:40.800 --> 49:42.928
So I put a little extra
in here for you.

49:43.120 --> 49:45.122
All right?

49:49.400 --> 49:50.765
- Hey, Julio.
- Yo.

49:50.960 --> 49:53.531
What the fuck's going on, man?

49:53.680 --> 49:56.604
First all these hits.
Now the police searching our shit?

49:56.800 --> 49:58.689
If there was something
that we needed to know,

49:58.840 --> 50:01.650
Tommy would have
told us, all right?

50:01.800 --> 50:03.370
He was right
about moving the shit out

50:03.560 --> 50:05.881
and he was right
about dividing it up.

50:06.040 --> 50:07.720
Now y'all know
where the fuck you're going?

50:07.800 --> 50:10.406
- Yeah.
- Let's go. Get to work.

50:23.240 --> 50:25.368
Yo, the news
you were waiting for

50:25.520 --> 50:27.284
just walked through
the front door, man.

50:27.440 --> 50:28.805
Buy yourself
a bus ticket, nigga,

50:29.000 --> 50:30.968
'cause you need to get
back in town ASAP.

51:03.840 --> 51:05.410
Felipe.

51:14.880 --> 51:16.291
New Jersey.

51:16.440 --> 51:18.761
Teterboro.

51:20.360 --> 51:22.522
New York.

51:41.960 --> 51:44.770
I found Holly Weaver.

51:44.920 --> 51:49.130
Or should I say Monica Moore?

51:49.280 --> 51:51.442
What did she say?

51:51.600 --> 51:53.682
That you helped her
get away from Tommy.

51:53.880 --> 51:56.645
I wouldn't be here otherwise.

51:56.840 --> 51:59.081
So we can stop
with all this drama

51:59.240 --> 52:01.129
about me being a liar
and trying to trick you?

52:01.280 --> 52:02.770
Yes.

52:13.720 --> 52:16.690
That doesn't mean I'm gonna stop
trying to arrest Tommy.

52:18.840 --> 52:21.002
You need to know that.

52:24.800 --> 52:26.450
I know that.

52:26.600 --> 52:28.602
You won't stop
until Tommy's in jail...

52:28.760 --> 52:30.250
for nothing.

52:31.800 --> 52:35.282
It's not actually Tommy
I'm after.

52:36.560 --> 52:39.086
Just the man he works for...

52:41.400 --> 52:43.721
Felipe Lobos.

52:47.240 --> 52:50.084
Sounds like the new announcer
for "Sabado Gigante."

52:51.680 --> 52:54.763
"Soy Felipe Lobos."

53:09.400 --> 53:11.482
Angie Valdes.

54:12.360 --> 54:15.807
Hi, it's me.
What do I need to do?

54:22.120 --> 54:23.326

54:23.480 --> 54:28.407

54:28.560 --> 54:35.205
The MID is... O-O-X-Y-Q-9-4-4.

54:37.680 --> 54:40.809
That's all I need

54:41.000 --> 54:43.162
