00:11.554 --> 00:12.889

a room with a door,

and a black friend.

to little girls.

09:07.965 --> 09:10.008

17:37.181 --> 17:38.600
'Cause I can't remember.

17:38.683 --> 17:40.936
Did you tell me
that he surfed at night

17:41.019 --> 17:43.981
so his nemesis Gonzo wouldn't
sabotage his board again

17:44.063 --> 17:45.899
before the big competition?

17:45.983 --> 17:48.944
Or did I read about it?

17:49.027 --> 17:51.237
Everything you've said
about your boyfriend

17:51.321 --> 17:53.406
is straight out
of Baby-Sitters Club Mystery

17:53.490 --> 17:57.160
Number 12, colon,
Dawn and the Surfer Ghost.

17:57.243 --> 17:59.120
Isn't that right, Kelea?

17:59.203 --> 18:01.665
Or should I say, Xan?

18:01.748 --> 18:03.374
How did you know that?

18:03.458 --> 18:06.377
I only had two books with me
down in the...

18:06.461 --> 18:07.796
reading nook
when I was growing up

18:07.879 --> 18:09.047
and this was one of them.

18:09.130 --> 18:11.215
You cannot tell anyone
about this.

18:11.299 --> 18:12.509
Yeah.

18:12.592 --> 18:14.886
It'd be a shame if Simone
or Vidalia were to find out

18:14.970 --> 18:16.513
your story was a lie,

18:16.596 --> 18:18.932
a lie taken from a book
for middle schoolers.

18:19.016 --> 18:20.391
That's not true.

18:20.475 --> 18:21.935
Those books are recommended
for 12 and up.

18:22.019 --> 18:23.478
"And up," Kimmy!

18:23.561 --> 18:25.856
Go to your room, Xan,

18:25.939 --> 18:28.942
'cause you're fudging grounded.

18:29.026 --> 18:30.193
I hate you!

18:30.276 --> 18:31.862
This is for your own good.

18:31.945 --> 18:33.780
You're a kid,
and childhood is precious.

18:33.864 --> 18:35.406
It's okay that you're a virgin.

18:35.490 --> 18:37.034
What is your deal?

18:37.116 --> 18:40.537
What kind of 29-year-old woman
wears light-up Skechers?

18:40.620 --> 18:41.830
This isn't over.

18:41.913 --> 18:44.290
I'm gonna figure
you out, Kimmy,

18:44.374 --> 18:46.543
and then
I'm gonna destroy you.

18:46.626 --> 18:48.670
I know you are...

18:48.753 --> 18:50.881
but what am I?

18:51.631 --> 18:52.924
[scoffs]

18:56.887 --> 18:58.722
[knock at door]

18:58.805 --> 19:00.348
Mrs. Voorhees?

19:00.431 --> 19:02.392
Oh, Kimmy, perfect.

19:02.475 --> 19:04.895
I forgot to actually
fire you earlier.

19:04.978 --> 19:06.980
Anyway, you're fired.

19:07.064 --> 19:08.648
Just clean up downstairs

19:08.732 --> 19:10.901
and rotate the mattresses
before you leave.

19:10.984 --> 19:12.193
Okay,

19:12.276 --> 19:13.987
but just so you know,
I grounded Xan.

19:14.071 --> 19:15.864
She's in her room
listening to a rock tape,

19:15.947 --> 19:19.617
and Buckley is downstairs having
the best birthday of his life.

19:19.701 --> 19:21.745
Die, Iron Man!
Die!

19:21.828 --> 19:23.121
No!

19:24.081 --> 19:25.916
Did you really do all that?

19:25.999 --> 19:27.792
I did.

19:27.876 --> 19:30.169
I'm sorry that the party wasn't
what you wanted it to be.

19:30.253 --> 19:32.797
It's not your fault.

19:32.881 --> 19:34.382
I know I must seem crazy.

19:34.465 --> 19:35.967
I just thought
that if today were perfect,

19:36.051 --> 19:39.178
it would make a difference.
[voice breaking]

19:39.262 --> 19:41.598
Kimmy, I think my marriage
is falling apart.

19:41.681 --> 19:44.225
[Titus]
Please, not in the crotch!

19:44.308 --> 19:45.643
It was supposed to be
a two-week trip,

19:45.727 --> 19:48.312
but Julian's been gone
for two months.

19:48.396 --> 19:51.149
I was sure he was gonna
come back for this.

19:51.232 --> 19:53.568
And then he'd see me
being the perfect mother

19:53.651 --> 19:55.236
and the perfect wife,

19:55.319 --> 19:58.239
and then later in the evening,
the perfect foot slut.

19:58.322 --> 20:01.701
You know, who among us
is a perfect foot slut?

20:01.785 --> 20:03.995
[crying]
I know.

20:04.079 --> 20:07.415
Julian's probably
cheating on me...

20:07.498 --> 20:09.542
not with Fat Rhonda,
obviously,

20:09.626 --> 20:12.211
but he's been in Japan
a lot lately.

20:12.295 --> 20:14.923
You can get a mistress
in a vending machine there.

20:15.006 --> 20:16.800
Kimmy, what's happening to me

20:16.883 --> 20:19.677
is the worst thing that's ever
happened to any woman ever.

20:19.761 --> 20:22.680
[sobbing]

20:22.764 --> 20:25.558
[clears throat]
Mrs. Voorhees...

20:25.642 --> 20:28.478
do you think you can make it
through the next ten seconds?

20:28.561 --> 20:30.438
I guess so.

20:30.521 --> 20:31.731
Is it over?

20:31.815 --> 20:34.776
No, but it will be very soon.

20:34.859 --> 20:37.570
And then you start
on the next ten seconds.

20:37.654 --> 20:39.781
Just take it ten seconds
at a time.

20:39.864 --> 20:41.741
Everything will be okay.

20:41.825 --> 20:43.493
[sighs]

20:43.576 --> 20:46.621
Oh, Kimmy,
what would I do without you?

20:46.704 --> 20:49.415
[chuckles]

20:49.499 --> 20:52.543
You're my best friend.

20:54.087 --> 20:56.881
Well, why don't you get
some rest,

20:56.965 --> 20:59.176
Mrs. Voorhees?

20:59.258 --> 21:01.011
Okay.

21:02.637 --> 21:04.181
Kimmy, where do you think
you're going?

21:04.263 --> 21:06.349
I need human contact.

21:06.432 --> 21:08.685
Spoon me.

21:15.650 --> 21:17.360
Mm.

21:17.443 --> 21:21.489
[quietly]
One, two, three,

21:21.572 --> 21:24.993
four, five...

21:26.077 --> 21:27.078
[Titus] No!

21:28.121 --> 21:30.414
Look, look, look,
look, look, look.

21:30.498 --> 21:32.500
Iron Man is sorry,
Professor Genocide.

21:32.583 --> 21:34.169
I mean, you should blow up
the hospital.

21:34.252 --> 21:36.796
So... truce?

21:36.880 --> 21:37.964
Oh.

21:39.132 --> 21:40.299
Aw, damn it.

21:40.383 --> 21:42.301
What white bitch
got him golf clubs?

21:42.927 --> 21:44.428
You okay out there, Titus?

21:44.512 --> 21:46.097
I've made less for worse.

21:46.181 --> 21:48.099
Thanks, Kimmy!
Awesome party.

21:55.398 --> 21:57.234
[giggles]

23:03.382 --> 23:04.717
Good night, everybody!
