It's fine.

05:29.287 --> 05:31.331
She usually makes my costumes,

for her.

have you been working here?

to get me out of CDI.

09:31.862 --> 09:33.573
That, with the money I have saved up,

09:33.656 --> 09:36.951

I keep track of everything.
Can you just check it again?

12:06.809 --> 12:09.729
I understand that, Miss,
but you have no money in your account.

12:11.605 --> 12:12.857
That's not possible.

12:14.483 --> 12:16.986
Wait. It says here
that the co-owner of the account

12:17.069 --> 12:18.696

I know how hard it is for you
to handle Kat sometimes,

14:18.566 --> 14:20.150
especially since you're bipolar.

14:22.486 --> 14:23.654

14:27.908 --> 14:29.243
Why did you do that?

Can you let Mandy know I brought this by?

14:45.759 --> 14:47.303
Of course, Mr. Davis.

face-to-face?

15:07.531 --> 15:08.616
What are you talking about?

15:08.699 --> 15:11.744
I had to find out from my little brothers
that you and Mandy are having a kid.

Justin, I--

15:13.537 --> 15:15.873
It's fine that you don't give a shit
about what I think.

15:16.248 --> 15:18.167
The thing that really sucks is that...

15:18.709 --> 15:21.170
I'm the only one
that still seems to remember Mom.

15:23.005 --> 15:24.590

Are you driving home tonight?

16:31.657 --> 16:33.534
That is the rest, ma'am.
You gave me a twenty.

I gave you a hundred-dollar bill,
and you know it.

Ma'am, I promise you
that's your exact change.

and came over to help.

16:56.932 --> 16:59.268

-I didn't--
-I'm so sorry to hear that, ma'am.

17:02.771 --> 17:04.273
We absolutely can call the police,

to pull the security footage right now.

I think it's best that you leave that
at the bar, ma'am.

17:31.258 --> 17:33.052
Looks like you've had
a too much to drink.

17:45.606 --> 17:47.066
Can you believe that shit?

17:47.983 --> 17:50.986
I swear, they try to use the police
as their own personal bodyguard.

-Look, I don't have a choice,

19:06.854 --> 19:07.688

19:12.234 --> 19:14.027
for the costume she's having made for me,

19:14.111 --> 19:16.655

I'm just gonna have to make my own.

23:52.556 --> 23:53.723
I don't know what's wrong.

23:53.807 --> 23:56.268
Can you just tow me
to the nearest repair shop, please?

23:57.477 --> 23:59.187
And then give me a ride
to Pinecrest Lodge?

23:59.271 --> 24:01.481
I'm supposed to meet someone there,
like, now.

24:02.691 --> 24:03.692
Two hours?

24:04.526 --> 24:05.402
Fuck!

24:05.485 --> 24:07.821
No! No, okay, that's fine.
I'll be waiting.

24:12.993 --> 24:13.827
[beeping]

24:14.244 --> 24:16.621
No, no, no, no! Fuck!

24:25.755 --> 24:26.923
No-show, huh?

24:28.383 --> 24:29.217
Hm.

24:29.593 --> 24:32.471
Any chance this friend you're waiting for
is a girlfriend?

24:33.221 --> 24:35.348
To be honest,
I don't know what me and Kat are.

24:35.974 --> 24:36.850
Kat?

24:36.933 --> 24:38.685
Little ice skater chick at Jimmy's?

24:40.437 --> 24:41.521
Oh, come on.

24:41.605 --> 24:43.398
There's nothing wrong
with dating a white girl.

24:43.482 --> 24:44.691
I didn't even say nothing.

24:44.774 --> 24:46.693
Yeah, but I know what you're thinking.

24:46.776 --> 24:48.361
Trust me. I've heard it before.

24:48.737 --> 24:50.614
It's not some big deal. It's just...

24:50.697 --> 24:51.573
all I know.

24:52.032 --> 24:54.034
They were the only girls
I was around growing up.

24:54.618 --> 24:56.203
You do look like the Jack and Jill type.

24:56.703 --> 24:58.163
[both laugh]

24:59.164 --> 25:02.417
So you mean to tell me you didn't meet
any other black girls there?

25:02.501 --> 25:03.335
I did,

25:03.793 --> 25:06.171
but it was always awkward
'cause at every event,

25:06.254 --> 25:08.632
my mom would damn near
make me talk to them,

25:08.715 --> 25:10.634
so it never worked out.

25:11.092 --> 25:11.968
Hm-mm.

25:13.720 --> 25:14.554
[chuckles]

25:14.638 --> 25:16.473
[laughs]

25:16.890 --> 25:18.266
So...

25:18.350 --> 25:20.268
I'm about to go meet my friends.

25:22.312 --> 25:23.855
I think I'm gonna just head home.

25:25.982 --> 25:27.067
You have fun, though.

25:27.609 --> 25:28.610
All right. You too.

25:34.407 --> 25:35.242
Hey, wait.

[Carol] Nice jacket.

26:53.987 --> 26:55.405

27:01.620 --> 27:04.205
That's a thousand-dollar bottle
of champagne.

You used my savings to buy that.

27:14.674 --> 27:15.759
You promised.

27:17.719 --> 27:21.014
You promised you'd stay on your meds.
Look at you!

27:21.681 --> 27:24.476
-You're a mess.
-Always with the fucking meds! I'm fine!

27:24.893 --> 27:25.977
I don't have time for this.

27:27.228 --> 27:29.064
[Carol] Don't ignore me!

27:29.147 --> 27:30.565
I am still your mother!

27:31.066 --> 27:31.900
Stop!

27:31.983 --> 27:33.443
Oh, what? What's wrong, Kat?

27:33.526 --> 27:34.819
Am I embarrassing you?

27:34.903 --> 27:37.864
[shouting] Do I embarrass you?
You're gonna wish you were nicer to me.

27:37.947 --> 27:40.158
Calm down, okay? Just-- Just calm down.

27:40.241 --> 27:43.161
No! I will calm down
whenever I'm goddamn ready to calm down!

27:44.996 --> 27:45.955
You'll see!

27:46.706 --> 27:48.833
You'll see you need
to respect your mother!

27:50.210 --> 27:51.961
Me, not that other bitch!

27:57.509 --> 28:00.011
You wanna know what I think of Mandy
and her perfect fucking hair?

28:00.095 --> 28:01.012
[Kat] Stop!

28:01.554 --> 28:03.640
And her perfect
fucking real estate company?

28:04.057 --> 28:07.143
-It's fucking trash! It's all trash!
-[stammering] You're right.

28:07.602 --> 28:10.063
Okay. I'm ungrateful. All right?

28:10.563 --> 28:12.774
I'm sorry. You can keep the money.
Let's get outta here.

28:12.857 --> 28:15.068
No, now you're just saying
what you think I wanna hear.

28:15.151 --> 28:17.862
You think I can't tell the difference
between a lie and the truth!

28:17.946 --> 28:19.197
But I can! I do!

28:19.280 --> 28:21.491
I see everything! I know everything!

28:21.991 --> 28:24.994
Mom, you're having an episode.
We need to leave, okay?

28:25.078 --> 28:26.996
Don't you dare judge me.

28:27.956 --> 28:30.083
'Cause you'll never know what it's like
to get dirty,

28:32.043 --> 28:34.754
How could you?
You don't have the tools to succeed.

28:34.838 --> 28:37.841
You're just a fucking loser
who couldn't get over a little fall!

28:38.675 --> 28:40.009
You're not yourself right now.

28:40.093 --> 28:41.428
At least I'm not you.

28:41.511 --> 28:43.680
You'll never be a champion. Never.

28:44.889 --> 28:46.599
All that glitters isn't gold, Kat,

28:47.308 --> 28:48.601
and you're just a little glitter.

28:48.685 --> 28:50.186
[Mandy] Kat. Carol.

28:52.188 --> 28:53.314
Is everything all right?

28:53.398 --> 28:55.066
Stay out of it.
It's none of your business.

28:55.150 --> 28:56.234
It's okay. It's okay.

28:57.694 --> 28:59.195
Um, I need--

28:59.279 --> 29:00.572
I need to go, okay?

29:00.655 --> 29:01.614
Go.

29:05.243 --> 29:06.494
[panting]

29:06.578 --> 29:09.998
I don't know how you gave birth
to a girl as wonderful as your daughter,

29:10.081 --> 29:11.750
and I don't know what you're on right now,

29:12.500 --> 29:15.545
but if you're gonna mess with Kat,
you'll be messing with me too.

29:15.628 --> 29:18.423
And you do not want to fuck with me!

29:21.134 --> 29:22.927
Could we call a cab for Ms. Baker, please?

29:23.011 --> 29:24.721

Yeah, everywhere except the ice.

29:58.880 --> 30:00.006
Ssh. Don't tell my parents.

30:00.089 --> 30:02.300
At least you have parents
that actually care about you.

30:02.383 --> 30:03.927
Uh, be careful what you wish for.

It's also stupid.

You definitely can't drive.

36:12.211 --> 36:13.087
you get some sleep?

36:13.171 --> 36:15.089
I can't. Not till Serena gets home.

36:15.756 --> 36:17.049
I'll wait up for Serena.

36:18.676 --> 36:19.719
You should rest.

36:23.055 --> 36:24.098
Okay.

36:41.490 --> 36:42.658
Ugh!

36:44.118 --> 36:46.078
What is your car doing on my golf course?

36:47.788 --> 36:49.248
[Justin] What's... [sighs]

36:50.291 --> 36:51.542
[Justin] Well...

36:51.626 --> 36:55.213
that's the 12th tee, right?
So I was probably scared of hooking it.

36:55.296 --> 36:57.131
This some kinda joke to you?

36:57.215 --> 36:58.549
No! Twelfth's a killer.

36:59.133 --> 37:01.719
Three hundred yards, damn sand trap.

37:05.223 --> 37:07.391
Okay, yeah, I'll pay for the damage
to the greens, okay?

37:08.476 --> 37:11.229
You think I give a shit
about the goddamn greens?

37:11.604 --> 37:14.023
You got drunk,
and you got behind the wheel of a car!

37:14.106 --> 37:17.193
I was a block away from the bar, Dad.
I was taking a shortcut.

37:17.693 --> 37:21.447
You got drunk,
and you got behind the wheel of a car.

37:25.701 --> 37:26.619
Fuck.

37:28.329 --> 37:29.163
[sighs]

37:29.247 --> 37:30.748
You're right, Dad. That was...

37:32.875 --> 37:34.877
That was stupid. I wasn't thinking about--

37:34.961 --> 37:37.505
I can't do this again, Justin. I can't.

37:38.464 --> 37:39.882
I can't lose you this way, too.

37:39.966 --> 37:41.842
Dad, you won't. Okay?

37:45.930 --> 37:47.223
This won't happen again.

37:47.890 --> 37:48.975
I promise.

37:49.850 --> 37:51.936
I'm sorry you found out the way you did.

37:52.645 --> 37:53.604
It's okay.

37:54.772 --> 37:56.524
And I will always love your mother.

37:57.942 --> 37:59.527
I miss her like hell.

38:01.779 --> 38:02.613
Yeah.

38:08.160 --> 38:09.704
I blame myself for this.

38:11.956 --> 38:13.082
Your behavior.

38:14.000 --> 38:15.001
I've coddled you.

38:16.085 --> 38:19.088
I've given you too much,
trying to fill a void your mother left.

38:20.881 --> 38:22.967
But I can't do this anymore, Justin.

38:23.050 --> 38:24.427
This is your final warning.

38:25.136 --> 38:26.220
One more fuck-up,

Knocked my son right out of the top spot.

41:40.664 --> 41:42.208
Not an easy task.

She's gotta catch a five o'clock flight,

Oh, thank you, sweetie, but you know
you really didn't have to do that.

[James] I know why she did it.

42:22.665 --> 42:24.667
I'm the same way. Never liked a handout.

And thank you, by the way,
for being such a good example with Justin.

He certainly needs all the help
he can get right now.
