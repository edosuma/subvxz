00:02.134 --> 00:03.828
Previously on The Vampire Diaries:

00:04.003 --> 00:06.938
For over a century,
I have lived in secret, until now.

00:07.106 --> 00:08.971
I know the risk,
but I have to know her.

00:09.141 --> 00:12.804
- How come you don't sparkle?
- Because vampires burn in the sun.

00:12.978 --> 00:15.811
- You go in the sun.
- I have a ring. Protects me.

00:15.981 --> 00:17.448
The pocket watch, where is it?

00:17.616 --> 00:19.743
- It's mine.
- Did you get the Gilbert watch?

00:19.952 --> 00:21.476
- I can get it.
- Good. We need it.

00:21.720 --> 00:24.211
- What is that?
- It's a very important crystal.

00:24.390 --> 00:29.054
You're the mystery guy, and I like that,
but with mystery comes secrets.

00:29.261 --> 00:32.389
- I just need you to trust me.
- Trust is earned.

00:32.564 --> 00:33.724
Caroline, what happened?

00:33.899 --> 00:35.457
- Nothing.
- Did Damon hurt you?

00:35.634 --> 00:38.865
- There are bruises all over Caroline.
- I'm handling it.

00:39.071 --> 00:41.301
Vervain could weaken him if he ingested it.

00:41.473 --> 00:43.771
It would help get you the upper hand.

00:44.276 --> 00:47.905
I knew I couldn't
spike your drink, so I spiked hers.

00:50.115 --> 00:52.675
- Five bodies all drained of blood?
- They've come back.

01:07.499 --> 01:09.330
Where's my ring?

01:10.102 --> 01:11.831
Won't be needing it anymore.

01:17.109 --> 01:20.101
- How long have I been here?
- Three days.

01:21.947 --> 01:23.175
What are you doing?

01:23.348 --> 01:25.680
During the Dark Ages,
when a vampire's actions...

01:25.918 --> 01:29.410
...threatened to expose
or bring harm upon the entire race...

01:29.621 --> 01:31.054
...they would face judgment.

01:31.290 --> 01:35.522
They sought to reeducate them
rather than to punish them.

01:36.862 --> 01:40.696
You know what will happen
if I don't feed on blood.

01:40.866 --> 01:42.333
You'll grow weaker and weaker.

01:42.534 --> 01:45.059
And eventually,
you won't be able to move or speak.

01:45.304 --> 01:48.535
In a week, your skin will desiccate,
and you'll mummify.

01:48.707 --> 01:50.299
A living corpse.

01:50.509 --> 01:53.706
Unable to hurt anyone. Ever.

01:53.879 --> 01:57.679
So, what, you're just gonna leave me
in the basement forever?

01:57.850 --> 02:00.580
I've injected you with enough vervain
to keep you weak.

02:00.819 --> 02:03.913
Once your circulation stops,
I'll move you to the family crypt...

02:04.089 --> 02:06.956
...and then in 50 years,
we can reevaluate.

02:07.392 --> 02:10.452
- I'm stronger than you think.
- You always have been.

02:10.963 --> 02:15.696
But you're not stronger than the vervain,
and we both know it.

02:18.403 --> 02:20.064
I'm sorry.

02:23.208 --> 02:25.540
Didn't have to be this way.

03:14.726 --> 03:16.751
Oh, I'm sorry. I'm almost done.

03:17.429 --> 03:20.023
It's okay. Take your time.

03:27.472 --> 03:30.236
I think you might be in trouble.

03:30.909 --> 03:32.467
What'd you do?

03:32.644 --> 03:36.239
- Elena saw me.
- I'm a drug-using delinquent.

03:36.415 --> 03:39.350
Girl in bed doesn't really rank. Sorry.

03:43.822 --> 03:45.414
Jenna.

03:45.591 --> 03:47.991
Are you aware of what's going on upstairs?

03:48.160 --> 03:49.457
Uh-huh.

03:49.628 --> 03:52.859
- And you have no objection?
- He could be craftier about it.

03:53.332 --> 03:55.800
At least make an effort
to sneak her in and out.

03:56.001 --> 03:59.459
Oh, and just so you know,
I won't be home for dinner.

03:59.638 --> 04:03.836
Ohh. So you're actually going to do it.
You're gonna go out with Logan.

04:04.076 --> 04:07.443
I'm gonna show up
and torture him, yes.

04:07.946 --> 04:09.675
And have you heard from Stefan?

04:10.182 --> 04:14.118
Not since he left
that very vague message three days ago.

04:14.286 --> 04:18.689
"Hi. Um, Elena, I, um...
I have something I have to do.

04:18.890 --> 04:21.882
I'll, uh, explain in a few days."

04:22.661 --> 04:24.458
- Haven't you called him?
- Nope.

04:24.663 --> 04:26.324
Not going to either.

04:27.165 --> 04:28.689
And you're okay with everything?

04:29.968 --> 04:33.995
No, I'm not okay with any of it.
But I'm not gonna cry about it either.

04:34.206 --> 04:36.674
I was gonna write in my diary,

04:36.842 --> 04:39.834
"What am I gonna write?"
I'm not gonna be one of those girls...

04:40.045 --> 04:43.208
...whose world stops spinning
because of some guy.

04:43.749 --> 04:44.875
Okay, then.

04:45.517 --> 04:47.382
I'll be fine.

04:48.553 --> 04:51.044
He's awake.
He's weak, but it's probably best...

04:51.223 --> 04:53.418
...to stay out of the basement.
He's Damon.

04:53.625 --> 04:55.525
I'm not sure how dangerous
he might be.

04:55.694 --> 04:58.219
- You're going to school?
- Came here to live a life.

04:58.430 --> 05:02.059
It's time I get back to that,
and Elena, if she's still speaking to me.

05:02.234 --> 05:03.565
Why haven't you called her?

05:03.735 --> 05:05.999
What am I supposed to do,
feed her another lie?

05:06.171 --> 05:09.538
I hate lying. I'm not good at it.
She thinks I'm hiding something.

05:09.708 --> 05:12.939
What choice do you have? You came
back here because you wanted...

05:13.145 --> 05:17.081
...to live as normal a life as you could.
You knew this was gonna be a part of it.

05:19.785 --> 05:21.184
I remember the party.

05:22.454 --> 05:23.716
Damon came up behind me...

05:23.889 --> 05:29.156
...and he was kissing my neck,
or biting my neck.

05:30.295 --> 05:31.455
I passed out.

05:31.663 --> 05:33.927
It's like there's holes
in my memory lately.

05:34.099 --> 05:36.397
It's just weird.

05:36.968 --> 05:40.904
- Maybe I let him bite me.
- Why would you do that?

05:42.274 --> 05:43.764
Can we just not talk about it?

05:43.942 --> 05:46.877
Okay?
I just don't wanna talk about Damon.

05:47.045 --> 05:50.037
I don't wanna talk about any of it.

05:50.215 --> 05:52.706
Just want to go back to normal.

05:54.219 --> 05:56.585
What are you doing with that candle?

05:57.456 --> 05:58.616
Um...

05:58.790 --> 06:00.451
Nothing.

06:01.126 --> 06:02.616
What's this?

06:02.794 --> 06:04.819
Damon gave it to me.

06:04.996 --> 06:08.227
Or he was going to give it to me.

06:08.400 --> 06:12.564
- All I know is it's mine now.
- It's ugly.

06:12.738 --> 06:15.468
Well, then get
your grubby hands off it.

06:26.084 --> 06:28.143
The Sexy Suds Car Wash is tomorrow.

06:28.320 --> 06:30.811
The football team
and the band have committed.

06:30.989 --> 06:34.083
Well, not all the band.
Just the ones who can pull off a bikini.

06:34.259 --> 06:36.420
I want in-your-face sexy.

06:36.595 --> 06:39.928
I mean, it's a fundraiser,
for God's sake.

06:40.499 --> 06:42.023
Unbelievable.

06:42.267 --> 06:44.861
- It's like nothing happened.
- She's in denial.

06:48.106 --> 06:49.767
Hey.

06:50.308 --> 06:52.538
Hey. Uh, you know, I gotta go...

06:53.011 --> 06:54.501
...uh, be somewhere right now.

06:57.249 --> 06:59.012
I'm so sorry I haven't called.

07:00.752 --> 07:03.050
No worries. I'll live.

07:03.288 --> 07:05.620
I was dealing with Damon.

07:05.824 --> 07:09.760
- And did you deal with Damon?
- Yes. Yeah.

07:10.395 --> 07:11.828
For four days?

07:12.030 --> 07:13.998
You have every right
to be upset with me.

07:14.199 --> 07:19.466
- But can I explain it all to you, please?
- Sure. When?

07:19.638 --> 07:23.267
I gotta be home after school,
but the Grill around 4:00?

07:25.577 --> 07:27.670
- Okay.
- Thanks.

07:27.846 --> 07:31.976
Stefan, where's Damon?
He has some serious apologizing to do.

07:32.551 --> 07:33.984
He's gone, Caroline.

07:35.487 --> 07:36.715
When's he coming back?

07:37.789 --> 07:39.723
He's not coming back.

07:41.293 --> 07:43.193
I'm sorry.

07:51.570 --> 07:54.038
This is a good thing, Caroline.

07:56.241 --> 07:58.038
I know that.

08:05.851 --> 08:09.753
- Hey, Matt. Um, have you seen Stefan?
- Nope.

08:11.923 --> 08:15.950
But if you wanna kill some time,
you can rack.

08:17.095 --> 08:19.563
Come on,
we haven't played in forever.

08:20.131 --> 08:21.758
I'll let you break.

08:44.656 --> 08:45.987
I'm full of vervain.

08:48.660 --> 08:52.391
I've been putting it in my coffee
for 16 years.

08:53.465 --> 08:55.956
My blood will only make you worse.

08:58.069 --> 09:00.435
- Damon?
- So it was your vervain?

09:00.605 --> 09:02.402
Good for you.

09:03.241 --> 09:05.607
Good for you.

09:06.678 --> 09:09.476
Family only runs so deep, huh?

09:10.916 --> 09:14.408
We're not family, Damon.
Only in the most dysfunctional sense.

09:14.619 --> 09:18.316
In fact, I avoided having a living,
breathing, loving family because of you.

09:18.490 --> 09:22.950
I don't guess I could talk you
into bringing me a rabbit or something?

09:23.128 --> 09:25.926
I'd settle for Stefan's diet
at this point.

09:26.097 --> 09:28.031
You know I can't do that.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.298
You succeeded, Zach.

09:32.671 --> 09:34.002
I'm shutting down.

09:36.141 --> 09:38.803
You're like your grandfather.

09:39.277 --> 09:41.609
He didn't like it
when I came to visit either.

09:41.780 --> 09:43.270
But you don't visit, Damon.

09:43.448 --> 09:47.475
You appear, unannounced,
reminding me that this isn't my house...

09:47.686 --> 09:50.120
...that you're just permitting me
to live here.

09:51.156 --> 09:53.681
Hell, that you're permitting me to live.

09:53.858 --> 09:55.621
Someone had to mow the lawn.

09:58.997 --> 10:01.488
I came to say goodbye, Damon.

10:07.005 --> 10:09.200
Unlock the door, Zach.

10:23.955 --> 10:25.013
Keep it up, Damon.

10:25.223 --> 10:28.351
More energy you expend,
the faster you'll go.

10:28.560 --> 10:31.028
And there's Vicki
all nonchalant in the bathroom...

10:31.196 --> 10:33.596
...like it's no big deal
that they're hooking up.

10:33.765 --> 10:36.461
Yeah, I'm not gonna lie,
your brother and my sister, that's weird.

10:36.635 --> 10:37.624
Yeah.

10:40.005 --> 10:41.165
How late is he?

10:43.375 --> 10:46.776
Hitting the hour mark.
Nothing's wrong, though.

10:47.612 --> 10:51.048
Which means I'm not talking
boy problems with you.

10:51.216 --> 10:55.778
Good. I mean, it's not like
we were ever best friends or anything.

10:57.989 --> 10:59.513
Okay.

10:59.891 --> 11:01.381
Here goes.

11:02.394 --> 11:04.021
What do you think of Stefan?

11:04.195 --> 11:06.356
- Is he a good guy?
- Why? What's he done?

11:06.531 --> 11:07.964
Not any one thing.

11:08.133 --> 11:10.727
He's just so secretive.
I think there's something...

11:10.902 --> 11:14.235
...that he doesn't want me to know,
which makes me wanna know.

11:14.406 --> 11:17.898
Like that he's a serial killer
and he keeps a clown suit in his trunk?

11:18.076 --> 11:20.010
No, of course not.

11:20.645 --> 11:22.738
But what do we know
about him, really?

11:23.314 --> 11:24.781
He's great at football.

11:25.650 --> 11:27.618
Little bit of a loner.

11:27.786 --> 11:32.018
And as much as I hate saying it,
he might be a nice guy.

11:35.293 --> 11:37.784
So you think I'm just being paranoid?

11:38.430 --> 11:41.729
- I think you should talk to him.
- Talk to who?

11:41.900 --> 11:44.391
I'm so sorry that I'm late.

11:44.602 --> 11:47.628
- What happened?
- I got held up.

11:48.606 --> 11:51.598
- Is everything okay?
- There's this thing with my uncle.

11:51.776 --> 11:54.677
You couldn't call and tell me
you're gonna be an hour late?

11:54.913 --> 11:56.608
Okay. You two have fun.

11:58.650 --> 12:02.746
- I'm really sorry. It was unavoidable.
- What was unavoidable?

12:05.757 --> 12:08.351
- Okay.
- No. Elena, please.

12:08.560 --> 12:10.494
No, Stefan, don't you get it?

12:10.662 --> 12:13.358
Every question
gets a vague non-answer.

12:13.598 --> 12:16.089
What is so awful
that you're afraid to tell me?

12:16.267 --> 12:18.201
I know you.

12:20.972 --> 12:22.439
My God.

12:23.007 --> 12:24.702
- I'm sorry?
- I know you.

12:26.111 --> 12:29.638
- How can it be?
- I think you have the wrong person, sir.

12:29.848 --> 12:32.783
You haven't aged a day.

12:35.019 --> 12:37.010
I'm sorry. Excuse me.

12:37.188 --> 12:41.955
Hey, can I take you home,
and we can talk about it?

12:42.127 --> 12:43.958
Is that okay?

12:44.129 --> 12:46.723
Wait. What was that?

12:47.132 --> 12:49.965
I don't know. Nothing.

12:50.602 --> 12:52.695
Right, nothing. Okay. Um...

12:53.338 --> 12:54.669
I gotta go, Stefan.

12:54.839 --> 12:56.636
Excuse me.

13:10.822 --> 13:12.084
I tried.

13:12.257 --> 13:14.248
I want so much to make things right...

13:14.492 --> 13:18.394
...but every instinct in my body
is telling me to be careful.

13:18.563 --> 13:21.191
What you don't know can hurt you.

13:21.399 --> 13:23.162
Evening, sheriff.

13:26.437 --> 13:28.905
- Anything?
- We went over the west side of the lake.

13:29.073 --> 13:32.065
All the caverns by the falls were clean.
No signs of habitat.

13:32.277 --> 13:33.869
Then they're staying in town.

13:34.045 --> 13:36.536
We canvassed all abandoned buildings
and warehouses.

13:36.714 --> 13:40.115
- There has to be a private residence.
- And that much harder to locate.

13:40.285 --> 13:42.344
These creatures know
how to go undetected.

13:42.520 --> 13:45.546
Someone who only comes out at night
should become obvious.

13:45.723 --> 13:47.748
- What about the watch?
- I'm working on it.

13:47.926 --> 13:51.384
I knew the Gilberts. That watch
is passed down to the men in the family.

13:51.563 --> 13:53.656
- I'd start with Jeremy.
- Hey, Logan.

13:58.436 --> 14:00.301
Can't believe you really came.

14:00.471 --> 14:01.563
You have an hour.

14:02.207 --> 14:03.265
Make it count.

14:04.542 --> 14:07.443
- You okay
- Is Vicki in there?

14:07.612 --> 14:09.773
Don't answer a question
with another question.

14:09.981 --> 14:11.881
Maybe.

14:12.217 --> 14:13.878
What's wrong with you?

14:15.587 --> 14:16.781
I'm miserable.

14:16.988 --> 14:19.582
Well, you should go
get something to eat.

14:27.432 --> 14:29.229
Jenna?

14:31.703 --> 14:33.330
Jenna?

14:35.106 --> 14:36.403
Stefan?

14:37.842 --> 14:40.174
- What are you doing here?
- Dinner.

14:40.345 --> 14:43.075
Jeremy told me chicken Parmesan
is one of your favorites.

14:43.248 --> 14:44.772
And I happen to be a good cook.

14:44.949 --> 14:48.510
Italian roots demand it. I can even make
my own homemade mozzarella.

14:48.753 --> 14:53.952
Only, tonight, it is,
unfortunately, store-bought. Sorry.

14:54.626 --> 14:57.288
I don't know
what you're trying to accomplish.

14:58.096 --> 14:59.654
You wanna know me, right?

15:01.299 --> 15:03.267
Well, I figure
if you're gonna dump me...

15:03.434 --> 15:06.369
...you should at least, um,
know who you're dumping.

15:08.239 --> 15:10.707
- So let's start with Katherine.
- Stefan...

15:10.875 --> 15:15.642
She was the most beautiful girl
that I had ever met.

15:16.648 --> 15:19.276
She had this perfect olive skin.

15:19.450 --> 15:22.681
And she had this laugh.
It was ridiculous.

15:22.854 --> 15:25.186
I mean, her laugh made you laugh.

15:26.391 --> 15:28.882
And she was fun.
She knew how to have a good time.

15:29.060 --> 15:35.966
But Katherine was also very impatient
and entitled and selfish and impulsive.

15:37.168 --> 15:38.829
Enter Damon.

15:39.037 --> 15:41.562
He claims that he was with her first.
I don't know.

15:41.806 --> 15:46.539
I do know that I did some things
that I'm not proud of.

15:47.879 --> 15:51.280
And my biggest regret...

15:52.083 --> 15:54.779
...is not being able to make it right
before she died.

15:57.922 --> 15:59.890
I miss her...

16:00.892 --> 16:04.350
...but I'm no longer crippled
by her loss.

16:06.331 --> 16:08.322
It was very nice what you did for Stefan.

16:08.533 --> 16:12.401
- Very romantic.
- Well, I was feeling romantic.

16:12.570 --> 16:14.561
Look what I found.

16:14.739 --> 16:16.172
"Elena Gilbert.

16:16.374 --> 16:19.673
Take one tablet every four to six hours
as needed for pain."

16:19.844 --> 16:21.903
Those are left over
from the car accident.

16:22.113 --> 16:24.411
So she won't miss them.

16:25.416 --> 16:28.078
No, not with that. That's an antique.

16:34.258 --> 16:37.022
I feel like we're always getting high.

16:37.562 --> 16:40.861
- That's the beauty of choice.
- Well, then let's choose not to.

16:41.065 --> 16:44.034
I mean, we don't have to be high
all the time, right?

16:44.569 --> 16:46.400
I hope you're not one of those guys...

16:46.571 --> 16:49.972
...who, now that we're together,
tries to change everything about me.

16:50.475 --> 16:51.965
No.

16:53.878 --> 16:55.368
Good.

17:01.119 --> 17:05.818
I'm an avid reader. Huge Fitzgerald fan.
The Great Gatsby, his masterpiece.

17:05.990 --> 17:08.481
But I'm no snob.
I love some good Grisham.

17:08.659 --> 17:12.390
I think Seinfeld is the best American
television show of the past 50 years...

17:12.563 --> 17:15.054
...but I Love Lucy is all-time.

17:15.266 --> 17:17.496
The "Loving Cup" episode
is the best, I think.

17:17.667 --> 17:19.260
Huge Scorsese fan.

17:19.436 --> 17:23.099
I can watch Taxi Driver
over and over again.

17:23.307 --> 17:25.468
Here. Let me.

17:25.643 --> 17:28.271
As far as music,

17:28.445 --> 17:31.813
Dylan, Hendrix, Patsy,
Willie, little Kanye.

17:31.983 --> 17:34.315
You know what?
I even like that one Miley song.

17:34.652 --> 17:35.676
Easy.

17:35.887 --> 17:39.015
I didn't say anything.
Hey, this is for the garlic bread, right?

17:39.190 --> 17:42.523
Because I'm not eating garlic
unless you agree to, too.

17:42.693 --> 17:44.627
Are you kidding? I love garlic.

17:46.564 --> 17:48.555
Ow! Ah!

17:49.333 --> 17:50.891
- You okay?
- Um...

17:51.102 --> 17:53.502
Yeah, I think so.

18:07.218 --> 18:10.016
- Your face.
- Yeah, yeah.

18:10.188 --> 18:12.156
I think I got something in my eye.

18:12.323 --> 18:14.018
Stefan.

18:14.725 --> 18:16.352
Hey.

18:16.527 --> 18:18.427
Stefan.

18:26.003 --> 18:32.841
Um, I think that my paranoia
has turned into full-blown hallucinations.

18:33.010 --> 18:34.944
Part of your charm.

18:57.702 --> 18:59.761
Caroline.

19:01.038 --> 19:02.369
Caroline.

19:02.540 --> 19:07.603
No, Tiki, do not do the one-piece, okay?
I've seen it on you. Trust me.

19:07.778 --> 19:11.270
Yeah, we are going for
a stripper-pole vibe this year.

19:12.517 --> 19:14.348
Caroline.

19:15.786 --> 19:19.051
Yeah, maybe we should wash the cars
in slow motion.

19:19.690 --> 19:21.089
No.

19:21.259 --> 19:23.193
Caroline.

19:26.264 --> 19:29.062
What? Oh, no, sorry. Um...

19:29.233 --> 19:31.201
So I'll just see you tomorrow.

19:31.369 --> 19:34.896
Two-piece. Okay. Bye.

19:39.310 --> 19:42.302
Shoo. Shoo. Shoo!

19:44.215 --> 19:45.876
God.

20:01.232 --> 20:05.225
I bet you're feeling pretty good
about yourself, aren't you?

20:10.474 --> 20:14.069
- Not particularly.
- You won.

20:14.245 --> 20:16.338
You got the bad guy.

20:16.847 --> 20:19.441
Now nothing can come between
you and Elena.

20:21.652 --> 20:23.051
Except the truth.

20:23.688 --> 20:26.316
The lies will catch up to you, Stefan.

20:26.557 --> 20:29.788
Long as you keep lying to yourself
about what you are.

20:29.961 --> 20:33.124
The beauty of you in there
and me out here...

20:33.664 --> 20:35.256
...is that I can walk away.

20:48.579 --> 20:51.047
No friend discounts. No freebies.

20:51.215 --> 20:53.706
No pay-you-laters.
We are not running a charity here.

20:53.884 --> 20:55.647
- No, we are not.
- Hi.

20:55.820 --> 20:57.617
Hey.

20:58.889 --> 21:02.825
Uh, the event is called Sexy Suds,
you know?

21:05.162 --> 21:06.561
Did we just get scolded?

21:06.731 --> 21:08.665
- And judged, yeah.
- Wow.

21:08.833 --> 21:11.301
I'm sorry, but I guess
you're gonna have to take that off.

21:11.469 --> 21:13.630
Uh, I think you have to go first.

21:13.804 --> 21:15.669
Okay.

21:18.342 --> 21:19.707
Okay. Um...

21:19.877 --> 21:23.608
Sorry. So not sexy.

21:27.118 --> 21:29.018
I disagree.

21:33.991 --> 21:36.960
Uh-uh. No.
None of that tortured pining stuff.

21:37.762 --> 21:39.992
- I'm just observing.
- Uh-huh.

21:40.498 --> 21:43.331
Oh. Tiki. This one's yours.

21:44.502 --> 21:46.265
Why do I always get the homely ones?

21:47.705 --> 21:50.230
Just to be clear, your car's a POS.

21:50.408 --> 21:53.036
I mean, we can wash it,
but it's still a POS.

21:53.244 --> 21:54.541
You don't have to be rude.

21:54.745 --> 21:57.441
No, rude is uglying up the road
with that junker.

22:07.458 --> 22:09.551
What the... Oh, my God. What the...?

22:09.727 --> 22:11.092
Whoa. Hey.

22:12.163 --> 22:14.358
- Whoa!
- What the hell?

22:16.701 --> 22:18.191
Wet and wild, Tik.

22:26.610 --> 22:29.374
Proceeds are going
to the school's Athletic Department...

22:29.580 --> 22:33.482
...still healing from the tragic death
of their football coach, William Tanner.

22:33.718 --> 22:36.482
The citizens of Mystic Falls
coming together in support...

22:36.687 --> 22:38.678
...of one of their own.

22:39.390 --> 22:40.823
Cut it.

22:41.926 --> 22:44.486
- Classy.
- Thank you.

22:44.695 --> 22:47.994
But you're still gonna video
the girls in bikinis, right?

22:48.232 --> 22:51.827
Oh, 53 percent of Americans
watch the news with the sound off.

22:53.204 --> 22:55.638
Thank you for dinner.
I had a nice time.

22:55.806 --> 22:59.333
Do you remember the last time
we were in the school parking lot?

22:59.510 --> 23:01.978
Nope. Doesn't ring a bell.

23:02.213 --> 23:03.737
- Really? Hm.
- Nada.

23:05.082 --> 23:08.074
Especially not having sex
in the minivan.

23:09.820 --> 23:11.617
Yeah. That was a good day.

23:13.591 --> 23:14.922
- What?
- Ha, ha.

23:16.327 --> 23:19.455
- You're getting soap in that.
- Oh, it's fine.

23:19.630 --> 23:22.758
I noticed that Damon has one too.
Is there a story behind it?

23:22.967 --> 23:24.491
Yeah, it's the, um...

23:24.668 --> 23:27.102
It's the family crest.
It's from the Italian Renaissance.

23:27.271 --> 23:28.602
Huh.

23:30.341 --> 23:32.036
What's the stone?

23:32.243 --> 23:34.905
- It's called lapis lazuli.
- Ah.

23:35.746 --> 23:39.443
You should really take it off.
I can put it in my bag.

23:39.617 --> 23:42.211
No, it's fine, really.

23:42.386 --> 23:44.946
- Thanks, though.
- Okay.

23:45.122 --> 23:46.680
I'm gonna get some towels.

23:46.857 --> 23:48.347
Okay.

24:00.204 --> 24:03.071
Hey, we're out of towels
and those shimmy things.

24:03.274 --> 24:05.538
I will get some more. Mind the money.

24:39.944 --> 24:41.878
Caroline, help me.

24:42.346 --> 24:43.938
Caroline.

24:44.448 --> 24:46.177
Help me.

24:46.851 --> 24:48.409
Help me.

24:50.354 --> 24:53.551
- That'll be $20.
- Okay.

24:54.325 --> 24:55.519
I saw you last night.

24:55.726 --> 24:59.253
You were talking to a friend of mine.
At the Grill.

24:59.897 --> 25:02.365
Well, I thought
it was somebody I knew.

25:02.833 --> 25:04.061
Stefan Salvatore.

25:04.235 --> 25:08.035
No, it can't be.
It was just my mind playing tricks on me.

25:08.839 --> 25:10.773
Where do you think
you'd seen him before?

25:11.709 --> 25:14.872
When I first moved here,
I stayed at the Salvatore boarding house.

25:15.412 --> 25:18.939
Stefan was just passing through
to visit his uncle.

25:19.116 --> 25:22.244
I mean, none of us knew
he was even here until the attack.

25:22.453 --> 25:25.422
- The attack?
- His uncle got killed.

25:25.956 --> 25:28.754
Mauled by an animal in the woods.

25:31.595 --> 25:32.789
His uncle? Zach?

25:33.130 --> 25:35.223
Mm-mm. Joseph.

25:35.966 --> 25:38.764
I'm sorry, sir,
I don't think I'm familiar with the story.

25:38.936 --> 25:41.962
How could you?
I mean, this happened years ago.

25:42.907 --> 25:45.273
Grandpa, you gotta go.
Mom wants you home.

25:45.476 --> 25:47.171
Okay?

25:48.779 --> 25:51.680
He wasn't bugging you, was he?
He's a little Alzy-heimer.

25:51.882 --> 25:54.407
No, he was sweet.

25:56.253 --> 25:58.778
Hey, sir, I'm sorry.

25:58.956 --> 26:02.084
Are you sure
that the man that you saw...

26:02.593 --> 26:05.426
...that you knew,
his name was Stefan Salvatore?

26:05.596 --> 26:07.427
Yes.

26:07.598 --> 26:10.692
I remember his ring and his brother.

26:10.935 --> 26:12.630
- Damon?
- Yeah.

26:13.337 --> 26:15.601
Stefan and Damon Salvatore.

26:17.341 --> 26:23.837
- When was this?
- It was early June, 1953.

26:24.014 --> 26:29.816
Yeah. June, 1953.

26:45.970 --> 26:47.801
I'll be back.

26:51.175 --> 26:52.870
Caroline finally freed you, huh?

26:53.043 --> 26:56.979
Uh, I don't know where she went.
She abandoned me.

26:57.181 --> 27:01.345
Hey, I realized earlier, I had no idea
that your family was from Italy.

27:01.518 --> 27:05.511
No? Last name Salvatore
didn't do it for you?

27:05.689 --> 27:07.919
Right. Duh.

27:08.592 --> 27:11.459
Are there any other Salvatores
in Mystic Falls?

27:12.062 --> 27:14.724
- My Uncle Zach.
- Where did everyone else go?

27:16.533 --> 27:20.025
- Kind of just spread out.
- Mm.

27:20.204 --> 27:21.569
Why?

27:22.673 --> 27:25.335
I'm just trying to learn
more about you.

27:28.045 --> 27:29.512
Where are you taking me?

27:29.680 --> 27:32.513
We can't hide out in your room all the time.

27:32.683 --> 27:35.550
Welcome to
my other favorite party place.

27:35.719 --> 27:37.414
What, the cemetery?

27:37.588 --> 27:39.783
Yeah. It's cool, huh?

27:40.424 --> 27:43.689
- Yo, Vick.
- What's up, Jared?

27:43.861 --> 27:46.921
- You babysitting, Donovan?
- This is Jeremy. He's cool.

27:47.131 --> 27:48.928
Smoke up.

27:49.900 --> 27:50.992
Thanks.

28:00.210 --> 28:04.306
- Your car was done an hour ago.
- You are saying that out loud, why?

28:04.515 --> 28:06.107
Hi. Elena, right?

28:06.283 --> 28:08.376
I think I met you once
when you were 9.

28:08.585 --> 28:11.110
Your emotional maturity level
when we were together.

28:11.321 --> 28:12.982
Ouch. I thought we were
making progress.

28:13.157 --> 28:17.491
Is he enough in your good graces
that I can ask him for a favor?

28:17.661 --> 28:20.630
If I do her a favor,
will I get back in your good graces?

28:20.798 --> 28:24.734
- A very reluctant "maybe" to both.
- Done. Wait.

28:24.902 --> 28:28.394
Dinner, tonight, your house.

28:28.605 --> 28:30.664
Fine. But you're eating leftovers.

28:30.874 --> 28:31.966
Ooh.

28:32.676 --> 28:33.734
What do you need?

28:33.911 --> 28:37.438
Do you have access
to old news stories, say, '50s?

28:37.614 --> 28:41.573
At the station. Between the archives
and the Internet, we have everything.

28:41.752 --> 28:44.448
I have this report, way past due.
You'd be a lifesaver.

28:44.655 --> 28:46.088
I'm heading there now.

28:46.256 --> 28:47.814
Let's go.

28:48.425 --> 28:49.449
If anyone asks...

28:49.626 --> 28:53.619
...you don't know where I went.
I don't want Caroline to know that I left.

29:00.604 --> 29:02.799
Caroline.

29:08.479 --> 29:10.310
Help.

29:40.711 --> 29:42.110
Caroline.

29:46.049 --> 29:47.983
Damon?

29:57.895 --> 29:59.487
Damon?

30:02.065 --> 30:03.123
Damon?

30:07.838 --> 30:09.703
Oh, my God.

30:09.873 --> 30:10.931
What is this?

30:11.942 --> 30:13.671
How did I know that you were here?

30:14.711 --> 30:16.338
Because I wanted you to.

30:17.080 --> 30:20.243
Very, very badly.

30:23.453 --> 30:26.889
Let me out of here. Please.

30:28.158 --> 30:32.151
- You bit me.
- You liked it. Remember?

30:34.698 --> 30:39.897
Why do I keep remembering
the same things, but in different ways?

30:40.404 --> 30:43.862
You remember
what I want you to remember.

30:44.041 --> 30:46.737
And now that the vervain
has passed out of your system...

30:46.910 --> 30:50.038
...you won't remember
what you're about to do.

30:51.949 --> 30:54.076
What am I about to do?

30:54.985 --> 30:57.579
You're gonna open the door.

31:00.090 --> 31:02.217
You're gonna open the door.

31:07.698 --> 31:09.325
No.

31:11.835 --> 31:14.133
Get out of here. Now. Run!

31:15.305 --> 31:16.932
Run.

32:01.451 --> 32:04.113
- Sweeper duty.
- What?

32:04.288 --> 32:06.654
- We have to clean the pavement.
- It's a car wash.

32:06.857 --> 32:09.519
- By definition, the pavement's clean.
- But not dry.

32:09.760 --> 32:10.886
And I'm doing this, why?

32:11.061 --> 32:14.030
Caroline bailed,
so that leaves me in charge.

32:14.364 --> 32:16.389
Fabulous.

32:42.359 --> 32:44.054
Somebody call the fire department.

32:53.236 --> 32:54.897
Bonnie.

32:55.072 --> 32:56.437
Bonnie.

32:56.606 --> 32:57.800
Bonnie.

32:58.742 --> 33:00.676
- Hey.
- What just happened?

33:00.844 --> 33:04.109
You were in some kind of a trance.

33:05.816 --> 33:07.909
Did I do this?

33:08.452 --> 33:09.749
I think so, yeah.

33:11.254 --> 33:12.812
Nobody else saw, did they?

33:14.257 --> 33:16.350
No? Don't tell anybody.

33:17.594 --> 33:19.255
Please.

33:22.366 --> 33:24.698
We digitized all our archives last year.

33:24.901 --> 33:27.927
You can pull all the remote footage
right up on-screen.

33:28.105 --> 33:29.936
What is it exactly you're looking for?

33:30.107 --> 33:33.133
An incident from 1953,
if it even happened...

33:34.644 --> 33:37.044
...at the old Salvatore boarding house.
- Sorry, one second.

33:37.214 --> 33:40.650
Yeah? Fire?
All right. I'll be right there.

33:40.851 --> 33:44.048
I gotta go. You believe there's
actual news to cover in this town?

33:44.254 --> 33:47.417
Use keywords to search the database.
It's pretty easy to navigate.

33:47.591 --> 33:50.389
Brady, down in Tech, will help you out,
anything you need.

33:50.560 --> 33:52.391
- Okay.
- All right?

33:52.929 --> 33:56.660
Oh, hey. Could you put in a good word
for me with Jenna?

33:57.167 --> 33:59.294
- You got it.
- All right.

33:59.503 --> 34:00.765
Good luck.

34:05.876 --> 34:09.902
- What?
- I'm stoned in a cemetery.

34:10.679 --> 34:12.670
They don't mind. They're dead.

34:13.315 --> 34:15.876
You know what?
I'm gonna take us up a notch.

34:17.087 --> 34:19.112
Hey, Tony.

34:20.424 --> 34:22.085
Nice.

34:22.259 --> 34:24.989
Vickies from Vicki. Ha!

34:25.161 --> 34:28.255
Oh, thank you, Elena Gilbert,
whoever you are.

34:28.431 --> 34:31.799
- You took those from the house?
- She wasn't using it.

34:32.268 --> 34:35.329
She's gonna notice if they're gone.
That's not cool.

34:36.206 --> 34:39.300
- It's no big deal, Jer.
- Yeah, it kind of is, Vick.

34:39.476 --> 34:41.467
Damn, dude.

34:41.645 --> 34:45.775
- Vicki brought the party police.
- Shut up, Tony.

34:48.185 --> 34:50.085
Sorry. I didn't mean to make you mad.

34:50.253 --> 34:52.447
What are we doing
with a bunch of losers?

34:52.621 --> 34:53.679
Those are my friends.

34:53.857 --> 34:56.621
They're waste-of-space,
small-town lifers.

34:56.793 --> 34:58.727
Yeah? What am I?

34:58.962 --> 35:00.953
- You're different, Vick.
- No, you are.

35:01.131 --> 35:04.794
You're the kid with the big house who's
acting out because his parents died.

35:04.968 --> 35:08.460
Guess what, you'll get over it.
You'll pull yourself together, move on...

35:08.638 --> 35:12.074
...and one day tell your kids stories
about your dark period growing up.

35:12.242 --> 35:15.575
I'll still be waiting tables at the Grill,
partying at the cemetery...

35:15.745 --> 35:18.646
...with a bunch of waste-of-space,
small-town lifers.

35:19.649 --> 35:20.741
Go home, Jeremy.

35:20.984 --> 35:25.512
If I wanna feel like crap about myself,
I'll just go back to Tyler.

35:32.596 --> 35:34.587
Hey, have you seen Elena?

35:35.265 --> 35:37.460
No, not for a while.

35:37.968 --> 35:40.198
- You think she went home?
- Not sure.

35:40.403 --> 35:42.166
- Thanks.
- Hey.

35:42.339 --> 35:44.705
- Yeah?
- I'm not saying this for you.

35:44.875 --> 35:48.902
I'm saying it for her.
But she's big on trust.

35:49.079 --> 35:51.104
So whatever
you're holding back from her...

35:51.281 --> 35:55.217
...the more you try to hide it, the more
she won't stop till she figures it out.

36:12.369 --> 36:15.998
This is Franklin Fell reporting to you
from the Salvatore boarding house...

36:16.206 --> 36:19.403
...where a brutal animal attack
has ended in tragedy.

36:20.443 --> 36:23.435
Hey, they're bringing out the body.
See if you can get closer.

36:29.019 --> 36:30.714
Is that the nephew?

37:03.587 --> 37:06.078
I didn't see you at the car wash.

37:07.357 --> 37:08.756
Left early.

37:09.993 --> 37:11.551
Honey, are you okay?

37:12.262 --> 37:15.425
Anything you wanna talk about?

37:16.433 --> 37:17.457
Is it a boy thing?

37:18.702 --> 37:22.604
Mom, if I wanna talk boys,
I'll call Dad.

37:22.772 --> 37:24.603
At least he's successfully dating one.

37:39.189 --> 37:40.781
Zach!

37:43.893 --> 37:46.020
Oh, God, no, Zach.

37:46.196 --> 37:49.962
Dear diary. I'm not a believer.

37:50.133 --> 37:53.364
People are born, they grow old,
and then they die.

37:54.037 --> 37:56.471
That's the world we live in.

38:03.313 --> 38:07.079
There's no magic, no mysticism,
no immortality.

38:07.250 --> 38:10.242
There is nothing
that defies rational thought.

38:15.325 --> 38:17.486
I don't know what's happening to me.

38:18.695 --> 38:20.162
I know, dear.

38:22.832 --> 38:24.891
Oh, Grams.

38:27.837 --> 38:29.361
Logan?

38:32.442 --> 38:33.875
Logan?

38:35.578 --> 38:38.706
People are supposed to be
who they say they are, and not lie...

38:38.882 --> 38:41.544
...or hide their true selves.

38:43.553 --> 38:45.418
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, hey, man.

38:45.655 --> 38:47.646
Just looking for the bathroom.

38:57.734 --> 39:01.693
It's not possible.
I'm not a believer. I can't be.

39:01.871 --> 39:05.898
But how can I deny
what's right in front of me?

39:06.076 --> 39:08.271
Someone who never grows old.

39:08.445 --> 39:10.936
1953.

39:11.181 --> 39:12.478
Never gets hurt.

39:12.682 --> 39:16.413
Oh, my God. Your hand.
Is it deep? How bad is it?

39:17.554 --> 39:20.216
Someone who changes
in ways that can't be explained.

39:20.423 --> 39:23.722
Hey. Um, are you okay? Your eye.

39:29.999 --> 39:31.057
Your face.

39:31.267 --> 39:32.291
Girls bitten.

39:32.469 --> 39:35.097
- What is that What happened to you?
- It's nothing.

39:35.271 --> 39:37.068
Bodies drained of blood.

39:37.273 --> 39:42.438
- Did she say what kind of animal it was?
- She said it was a vampire.

39:54.524 --> 39:56.082
Donovan?

39:56.793 --> 39:58.818
No, I'm good.

40:07.370 --> 40:08.496
- Not it.
- Not it.

40:08.671 --> 40:10.138
Not it.

40:10.306 --> 40:12.297
Ha, ha! Vicki.

40:26.890 --> 40:28.619
Hey, man, you okay?

40:32.162 --> 40:33.789
Come here.

40:34.264 --> 40:35.959
Come here.

40:36.132 --> 40:39.067
- Come here.
- You don't look good.

40:39.269 --> 40:40.327
Come closer.

40:41.037 --> 40:43.130
I have something...

40:43.306 --> 40:45.536
...I have to tell you.

40:48.745 --> 40:51.236
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.

40:51.414 --> 40:54.850
I gotcha. I gotcha. It's okay. It's okay.

41:34.023 --> 41:35.581
What are you?
