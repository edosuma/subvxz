(serene music playing)

01:04.633 --> 01:06.100
Hi, Rose.
How's it going?

01:06.166 --> 01:07.600
Hi, Blanche.

01:09.500 --> 01:11.300
God, I hate morning people.

01:13.800 --> 01:15.633
Ever since
I've been a candy striper,

01:15.700 --> 01:19.333
I've been giving all my patients
the traditional St. Olaf fun pack.

01:19.400 --> 01:24.233
Each one has a pack of gum,
a bar of soap, and sock puppets.

01:26.033 --> 01:30.333
I like to pretend one's you
and one's Dorothy.

01:30.400 --> 01:34.000
(imitating Blanche)
Hi, Dorothy. How you feel?

01:34.066 --> 01:37.000
(imitating Dorothy)
Oh, woe is me.

01:37.066 --> 01:38.800
I can't get a date.

01:38.867 --> 01:43.300
Nobody asks me out.
Woe is me. Woe...

01:45.533 --> 01:46.767
Bad puppet.

01:48.233 --> 01:49.767
Dorothy, how's Sophia doing?

01:49.834 --> 01:52.900
She's resting,
but a hernia is painful.

01:52.967 --> 01:55.266
Well, honey,
put your mind at ease.

01:55.333 --> 01:58.066
The operation today's just
a minor procedure.

01:58.133 --> 02:01.500
And by the way, you have nothing
to be guilty about.

02:01.567 --> 02:03.900
What? I don't feel guilty.

02:03.967 --> 02:05.433
Oh, Dorothy, good God.

02:05.500 --> 02:06.834
You were cleaning
out the garage,

02:06.900 --> 02:09.200
and you asked Sophia
to move a sofa?

02:11.633 --> 02:13.166
Don't start with me.

02:13.233 --> 02:15.033
She's 84.

02:15.100 --> 02:17.400
You're asking her
to do the work of two men?

02:17.467 --> 02:19.300
It was wicker, all right?

02:20.700 --> 02:22.567
And the lazy boy?

02:22.633 --> 02:25.467
Blanche, leave her alone.
She feels bad enough.

02:25.533 --> 02:26.500
Thanks, Rose.

02:26.567 --> 02:28.233
Do we have any orange juice?

02:28.300 --> 02:30.667
Sure.
Should I pour you a glass

02:30.734 --> 02:33.400
or have Sophia come in
and bring you the refrigerator?

02:38.033 --> 02:39.367
Enough.

02:39.433 --> 02:43.600
Pussycat, I moved that safe
to the attic like you asked me to.

02:47.834 --> 02:50.266
Can I have food now?

02:50.333 --> 02:52.033
Ma, you can't have food

02:52.100 --> 02:54.133
because you're not supposed
to eat or drink anything

02:54.200 --> 02:55.667
the day of an operation.

02:55.734 --> 02:58.000
I'm not going to any hospital.

02:58.066 --> 03:00.533
I'm working on the admitting desk.

03:00.600 --> 03:02.000
Does that make it less scary?

03:02.066 --> 03:04.934
Oh, sure. In that case,
I'll get a boob job too.

03:07.400 --> 03:10.500
People die in hospitals.
They go in, they don't come out.

03:10.567 --> 03:12.100
Ma, that's not true.

03:12.166 --> 03:13.300
I'm still not going.

03:13.367 --> 03:16.500
You can't just
ignore your hernia.

03:16.567 --> 03:19.433
Blanche is right.
Right now it's very minor,

03:19.500 --> 03:22.900
but, honey, left untreated,
it could be very serious.

03:22.967 --> 03:26.166
A trip to the hospital
is the best thing for you.

03:26.233 --> 03:27.800
You think I'm stupid?

03:27.867 --> 03:31.233
This scam has Shady Pines
written all over it.

03:31.734 --> 03:33.166
Ma, be serious.

03:33.233 --> 03:34.734
We're all adults here.

03:34.800 --> 03:37.200
I see how you've been
eyeing my bedroom.

03:37.266 --> 03:40.934
"Wouldn't a wet bar go great
where the old lady is?"

03:40.967 --> 03:45.333
Why take you to Shady Pines
when you have a hernia?

03:45.400 --> 03:48.266
You took me there
after I had a stroke.

03:48.333 --> 03:50.934
I'm not getting anywhere.
Blanche, talk to her.

03:51.000 --> 03:53.200
-A wet bar...
-Blanche!

03:55.700 --> 03:59.467
Look, Ma, I love you.
I know what's best for you.

03:59.533 --> 04:01.834
Besides, I don't want
to feel pangs of guilt

04:01.900 --> 04:04.934
for the next 20 years
whenever you say "ow,"

04:05.000 --> 04:07.667
because I once asked you
to move a sofa.

04:07.734 --> 04:10.467
I have no choice. I'm in agony.

04:10.533 --> 04:13.133
Did you hear that?
Agony, Dorothy.

04:13.200 --> 04:17.367
Sophia, don't worry.
You made the right decision.

04:17.433 --> 04:19.567
I was going to give you this
when you got to the hospital,

04:19.633 --> 04:20.667
but I'm too excited.

04:20.734 --> 04:24.233
Here's your St. Olaf fun pack.

04:24.300 --> 04:26.200
Thanks. All right, I'm going.

04:26.266 --> 04:28.033
Here, Dorothy,
you throw this out.

04:29.734 --> 04:32.033
I'll push the car
around the front.

04:32.100 --> 04:36.767
(mellow music playing)

04:36.834 --> 04:40.000
All right.
Let's see. Who's next?

04:40.066 --> 04:41.467
Number 43?

04:44.033 --> 04:45.233
Thank you.

04:45.300 --> 04:47.500
Let's just fill out these forms.

04:47.567 --> 04:49.200
Your name? Brother Martin.

04:49.266 --> 04:50.266
Occupation?

04:50.333 --> 04:52.934
I'm a monk.

04:53.000 --> 04:55.633
Oh, good.
I almost wrote down Trekkie.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.033
What brings you to the hospital,
brother Martin?

05:01.100 --> 05:02.600
I don't enjoy talking about it,

05:02.667 --> 05:06.000
but I hurt my knee
dancing in my room.

05:07.400 --> 05:10.333
Do I know you?
You look awfully familiar.

05:10.400 --> 05:11.867
I get that a lot.

05:11.934 --> 05:14.567
People say
I look like Wilma Flintstone.

05:16.633 --> 05:20.200
Not when she was on the air,
more the way she looks today.

05:20.266 --> 05:22.233
No, I can see that too,

05:22.300 --> 05:26.066
but you remind me of someone
I knew a long time ago.

05:26.133 --> 05:31.133
I was cloistered in a small
monastery in St. Olaf, Minnesota.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.767
Where every spring
the ducks return?

05:33.834 --> 05:36.533
If we remember
to throw out corn, yes,

05:36.600 --> 05:38.433
you know it?

05:38.500 --> 05:39.667
I know it very well.

05:39.734 --> 05:42.166
I was born and raised in St. Olaf.

05:42.233 --> 05:45.567
Well, this is extraordinary.

05:45.633 --> 05:48.433
Did you know an Ingrid Kerclavaner?

05:48.934 --> 05:51.367
You knew Ingrid?

05:51.433 --> 05:53.166
She must have been 19 then.

05:53.233 --> 05:54.600
She worked in the kitchen
in the monastery.

05:54.667 --> 05:57.500
Talk, talk, all she did.

05:57.567 --> 06:01.266
We were a silent order,
so that was very refreshing.

06:01.333 --> 06:02.600
I suppose it was.

06:02.667 --> 06:05.734
Shortly after that,
Ingrid died in childbirth.

06:05.800 --> 06:08.900
-You know the story?
-Oh, yes.

06:08.967 --> 06:12.934
Late one night, a basket was left
at the local orphanage

06:13.000 --> 06:17.200
containing hickory smoked cheese,
spicy beef sticks,

06:17.266 --> 06:21.800
a baby, and some kind of crackers
that didn't go with anything.

06:23.066 --> 06:25.600
Eventually,
the Lindstroms took the baby

06:25.667 --> 06:27.867
and the beef sticks,
'cause that was the deal.

06:29.567 --> 06:31.500
They named the baby Rose.

06:31.567 --> 06:33.767
Did you know her,
Rose Lindstrom?

06:33.834 --> 06:36.500
Know her?
You're looking at her.

06:37.800 --> 06:42.633
The lord certainly works
in mysterious ways.

06:42.700 --> 06:44.233
What do you know
about your father?

06:44.300 --> 06:49.233
There was a rumor he was a clown
with Ringling brothers,

06:49.300 --> 06:51.066
but I never believed it.

06:51.133 --> 06:53.633
It just seemed too
much to hope for.

06:54.900 --> 06:56.800
Did you know him too?

06:56.867 --> 06:59.800
I've asked and I've asked,
and I've never found anybody

06:59.867 --> 07:01.266
who could tell me about him.

07:01.333 --> 07:04.166
Rose, I don't quite
know how to put this,

07:04.233 --> 07:08.266
but I'm your father.

07:10.567 --> 07:12.000
My father?

07:13.867 --> 07:18.133
(soft music playing)

07:18.200 --> 07:20.100
I can't believe it.
This really is the hospital.

07:20.166 --> 07:22.100
Ma, you have a hernia.

07:22.166 --> 07:25.934
Where'd you think I was taking you,
<i>Trampoline Village?</i>

07:26.000 --> 07:28.200
I thought you were taking me
to Shady Pines.

07:28.266 --> 07:32.066
I was looking forward
to the Chicken a la King.

07:32.133 --> 07:34.333
You really think
I tried to deceive you?

07:34.400 --> 07:36.800
I was, but I don't anymore.

07:36.867 --> 07:39.233
Now I think
you're trying to kill me.

07:39.300 --> 07:41.233
Ma, I know you're frightened,

07:41.300 --> 07:43.600
but do you think
I'd push for this operation

07:43.667 --> 07:45.900
if there was any risk?

07:45.967 --> 07:48.934
I don't know,
my little beneficiary.

07:53.734 --> 07:55.900
Oh, God.

07:55.967 --> 07:57.100
What's wrong?

07:57.166 --> 08:00.033
There's a very handsome doctor
coming this way.

08:00.100 --> 08:02.200
Dorothy, listen.

08:02.266 --> 08:04.834
If he walks by, pretend
we're having a conversation

08:04.900 --> 08:07.533
and casually mention
my unparalleled ability

08:07.600 --> 08:09.133
to satisfy a man.

08:10.600 --> 08:13.633
What, you don't think he's read
the men's room wall?

08:17.467 --> 08:18.834
Apparently not.

08:20.867 --> 08:23.600
I wonder where Rose is.
She said she'd be here.

08:23.667 --> 08:26.767
Rose, we've been
waiting for you.

08:26.834 --> 08:29.133
Rose? Rose?

08:29.200 --> 08:32.033
I'm sorry. I was distracted.

08:32.100 --> 08:33.633
You're not going to believe it.

08:33.700 --> 08:37.200
I just met my father,
my natural father.

08:37.266 --> 08:38.333
He's alive?

08:38.400 --> 08:39.667
He's in Miami?

08:39.734 --> 08:41.233
He's an earthling?

08:44.200 --> 08:47.100
He just walked in.
He's a monk.

08:47.166 --> 08:50.166
Must be a pretty
reformed order.

08:50.667 --> 08:52.433
Let's get you signed in.

08:52.500 --> 08:54.467
Rose, are you sure you're
up to this?

08:54.533 --> 08:56.033
Honey, maybe you'd rather talk.

08:56.100 --> 08:59.367
I'm ok. I can do this job
without thinking.

08:59.433 --> 09:01.100
Ok, name?

09:01.166 --> 09:04.166
Zulu, queen of the dwarf people.

09:06.133 --> 09:09.567
Rose, I don't think
you are up to this.

09:09.633 --> 09:10.700
Where were we?

09:10.767 --> 09:13.100
-Name.
-Rose Nylund.

09:14.233 --> 09:16.200
No, I'm fine.

09:16.266 --> 09:18.467
Here, Sophia.
Just sign this.

09:18.533 --> 09:19.667
I'll fill it in later.

09:19.734 --> 09:21.900
It's a standard consent form

09:21.967 --> 09:24.066
releasing the hospital
of responsibility,

09:24.133 --> 09:27.667
like if you're missing jewelry
or they kill you.

09:30.400 --> 09:32.033
I'm not getting
out of here alive.

09:32.100 --> 09:33.400
Ma, will you calm down?

09:33.467 --> 09:36.266
You're in the finest hospital
in Florida.

09:36.333 --> 09:38.200
Nothing's going to go wrong.

09:38.266 --> 09:42.433
Ok, Mrs. Petrillo,
let's see if we can patch you up.

09:42.500 --> 09:43.734
Thank you, Rose.

09:43.800 --> 09:46.800
Why is a woman your age
moving furniture?

09:48.100 --> 09:49.300
For food.

09:51.834 --> 09:53.000
Right this way.

09:54.633 --> 09:56.667
You make me sick.

09:58.100 --> 10:03.533
(calm music playing)

10:03.600 --> 10:07.700
Oh, I'm just so relieved ma came
through that operation ok.

10:07.767 --> 10:09.567
Yeah, she's a tough old woman.

10:09.633 --> 10:12.834
It takes a lot more than someone
like you to kill her.

10:17.233 --> 10:18.767
Rose, you going back
to the hospital?

10:18.834 --> 10:22.500
I promised a friend
I'd fill in for her,

10:22.567 --> 10:25.367
but it's the last place
in the world I want to be.

10:25.433 --> 10:26.767
Why, honey?

10:26.834 --> 10:28.266
Because of my father.

10:28.333 --> 10:33.800
How would you feel if you found out
your father was a celibate monk?

10:33.867 --> 10:36.367
It's not so unusual.

10:37.433 --> 10:41.367
Rose, we don't necessarily
get the parents we want.

10:41.433 --> 10:43.500
We get the ones we're dealt.

10:43.567 --> 10:46.700
When I was a kid,
I got angry with my parents.

10:46.767 --> 10:49.066
I imagined I had
different parents.

10:49.133 --> 10:51.233
Who? Who? It's really silly.

10:51.300 --> 10:52.867
-Come on, now, who?
-Tell us.

10:52.934 --> 10:56.867
Well, my dad was Errol Flynn.

10:56.934 --> 11:00.900
And my mother was Amelia Earhart.

11:00.967 --> 11:04.166
I wanted dad all to myself.

11:09.266 --> 11:11.633
You know
who my fantasy parents were?

11:11.700 --> 11:14.767
Who, Blanche?
Masters and Johnson?

11:17.767 --> 11:20.233
Not my fantasy neighbors.

11:21.567 --> 11:24.633
My fantasy mother was
the Queen of England,

11:24.700 --> 11:28.000
and then she died,
and I became queen.

11:28.066 --> 11:30.400
And all the men
were very happy

11:30.467 --> 11:32.900
for all the obvious reasons.

11:32.967 --> 11:35.734
And I looked cute on the money.

11:37.200 --> 11:39.467
'Course, all the women
were unhappy,

11:39.533 --> 11:42.633
but screw them, I was queen.

11:46.066 --> 11:48.600
I never worried about
who my fantasy parents were.

11:48.667 --> 11:52.300
I only worried about
who my real parents were.

11:52.367 --> 11:55.633
Imagine, a monk
who'd taken a vow of silence.

11:55.700 --> 11:56.567
I mean, they made love,

11:56.633 --> 11:58.800
and he never even
called her the next day.

11:59.800 --> 12:02.467
Oh, Rose, I know
you're disappointed,

12:02.533 --> 12:04.567
but, honey, confront your father.

12:04.633 --> 12:05.934
Tell him how you feel.

12:06.000 --> 12:07.900
At least you'll have
some relationship.

12:07.967 --> 12:11.066
-Right now you have nothing.
-I'm lucky.

12:11.133 --> 12:14.133
I had a wonderful father
whom I loved dearly,

12:14.200 --> 12:17.667
but now you have an opportunity
I'd give anything for,

12:17.734 --> 12:20.300
to have 10 minutes
more with big daddy,

12:20.367 --> 12:24.433
to hear that sweet old husky voice
once more,

12:24.500 --> 12:27.133
"They're admitting who
to my country club?"

12:29.800 --> 12:32.533
No, there's a difference, Blanche.

12:32.600 --> 12:35.066
That bigot was there for you.

12:36.400 --> 12:38.433
(telephone rings)

12:42.133 --> 12:43.467
Hello?

12:43.533 --> 12:46.633
Yes, this is her daughter.

12:46.700 --> 12:49.734
No, she's not here.
I left her with you.

12:49.800 --> 12:52.100
I was told she'd be in recovery.

12:52.166 --> 12:54.200
Never mind! I'm on my way!

12:54.266 --> 12:56.467
-What's the matter?
-They've lost my mother!

13:07.967 --> 13:10.066
Dorothy, wait up.

13:10.133 --> 13:11.400
Will you wait a minute?

13:11.467 --> 13:13.934
-You just walk so fast.
-I am in a hurry.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.600
It's not sexy.

13:16.667 --> 13:17.800
Well, it's not.

13:19.567 --> 13:21.667
A woman should take
little delicate steps.

13:21.734 --> 13:26.500
As if to say, "I may be slower than you,
but maybe I'm worth waiting for."

13:27.000 --> 13:29.500
It is the middle of the night,
my mother is missing,

13:29.567 --> 13:32.533
I am scared to death,
and I'm trying to find a doctor.

13:32.600 --> 13:37.133
You'll have to excuse me
if I don't have a rolling gait.

13:38.867 --> 13:42.266
Now, look, Dorothy,
I'm scared too.

13:42.333 --> 13:44.533
Sophia's practically my mother too.

13:44.600 --> 13:47.667
If we don't find her, I don't
know how I'm gonna respond.

13:47.734 --> 13:51.400
But I like to think
I won't be any less sexy.

13:51.467 --> 13:54.800
You're just a big pile of estrogen,
aren't you?

13:56.433 --> 13:59.100
Where is Dr. Warren?
This is insane.

13:59.166 --> 14:01.333
Where do doctors go
in the middle of the night?

14:01.400 --> 14:04.333
Their call rooms are up
on the twelfth floor, but...

14:05.867 --> 14:08.533
you have to take
the back stairs.

14:10.700 --> 14:13.834
Unless you have a special key
for the main elevator.

14:16.600 --> 14:17.900
I'm guessing.

14:19.800 --> 14:24.433
(serene music playing)

14:26.633 --> 14:28.066
Where am I?

14:29.000 --> 14:30.433
I must be dead.

14:31.834 --> 14:33.100
Is this heaven?

14:37.300 --> 14:39.500
Sal, is that you, Sal?

14:39.567 --> 14:41.033
Sorry, ma'am. Who's Sal?

14:41.100 --> 14:45.433
My husband. He's been waiting
for me a long time.

14:45.500 --> 14:47.066
Boy, you're pretty young.

14:47.133 --> 14:48.800
What brings a guy
like you up here?

14:48.867 --> 14:50.834
A lunatic. I'm a police officer.

14:50.900 --> 14:53.266
I was working a political rally

14:53.333 --> 14:54.967
when this madman
pulls out a revolver

14:55.033 --> 14:57.233
and blasts away from the roof.

14:57.300 --> 15:00.567
I got shot pulling a baby carriage
from the line of fire.

15:00.633 --> 15:01.500
How about you?

15:01.567 --> 15:02.900
The same.

15:06.467 --> 15:09.333
Pardon me, ma'am, but what are
you doing in here by yourself?

15:09.400 --> 15:11.734
Who are you?
Are you an angel?

15:11.800 --> 15:13.533
I'm the guy that shaves everybody.

15:16.000 --> 15:19.333
Amazing. That's not even
mentioned in the bible.

15:19.400 --> 15:21.200
Heaven sure isn't what I expected.

15:21.266 --> 15:22.233
Heaven?

15:22.300 --> 15:24.233
Ma'am,
you're on an elevator in a hospital.

15:26.000 --> 15:27.200
You mean I'm alive?

15:27.266 --> 15:29.166
Very much so.

15:29.233 --> 15:32.667
-What am I doing in here?
-That's what I was asking.

15:32.734 --> 15:34.467
Tell you what, ma'am.
I'll call patient care.

15:34.533 --> 15:36.900
They'll send somebody.

15:36.967 --> 15:39.233
-This is our floor.
-Good luck.

15:39.300 --> 15:44.033
Guys like you make it safe for old
ladies like me to walk the streets.

15:44.100 --> 15:46.767
I don't get the connection, ma'am,
but thank you.

15:59.667 --> 16:01.367
I'm glad you're visiting me.

16:01.433 --> 16:02.867
This is not a visit.

16:02.934 --> 16:04.400
It's part of my job.

16:04.467 --> 16:07.533
As far as I'm concerned,
you're just another patient,

16:07.600 --> 16:09.500
a monk with my nose.

16:11.834 --> 16:14.967
I realize it's a lot for you to deal
with suddenly.

16:15.033 --> 16:17.000
You must have so many questions.

16:17.066 --> 16:19.367
Just one, actually.

16:19.433 --> 16:21.867
Will you be having the halibut
or the chicken Kiev?

16:23.767 --> 16:26.100
Boy, you're really angry,
aren't you?

16:26.166 --> 16:29.033
"Where's this louse been
all these years?"

16:29.100 --> 16:31.600
But I assure you
there's an explanation.

16:31.667 --> 16:32.700
Halibut.

16:35.033 --> 16:36.567
I'm sure there is.

16:36.633 --> 16:38.433
I'll bet you're
quite a smooth talker.

16:38.500 --> 16:41.333
I'm sure it wasn't the uniform
that my mother fell for.

16:43.967 --> 16:46.233
Broccoli or creamed corn?

16:46.300 --> 16:49.166
Rose, you're terribly upset.

16:49.233 --> 16:50.367
Corn, please.

16:52.533 --> 16:54.834
I'm not upset. I couldn't care less.

16:54.900 --> 16:57.100
I owe you an explanation.

16:57.166 --> 17:00.133
You owe me more than that.

17:00.200 --> 17:01.767
Why didn't you ever
come to visit me?

17:01.834 --> 17:05.233
Rose, I stayed away because I
thought my appearing out of nowhere

17:05.300 --> 17:06.734
would be more than
you could handle.

17:06.800 --> 17:09.934
That's up to me to decide.

17:10.000 --> 17:12.567
No, and it's not up to me, either.

17:12.633 --> 17:14.533
It's up to the man
who brought us together.

17:14.600 --> 17:16.700
The intern in the paper shoes?

17:20.800 --> 17:23.266
No, Rose.
The Lord almighty.

17:23.333 --> 17:27.834
All these years,
wondering and hurting,

17:27.900 --> 17:31.333
but now by his bringing us together,
I believe he's forgiven me.

17:32.767 --> 17:34.600
My mother, did you love her?

17:34.667 --> 17:38.834
Yes, very, very much,
but then the Abbot found out.

17:38.900 --> 17:40.400
Bud Abbott?

17:42.667 --> 17:45.934
It would be nice
if you got one of these right.

17:46.000 --> 17:47.900
No, Rose, theAbbot.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.600
He told me to choose between
the church and your mother.

17:51.100 --> 17:53.200
I chose God.

17:53.266 --> 17:56.400
I think I have his forgiveness.

17:56.467 --> 18:00.300
But now, more than anything,
I'd like your forgiveness.

18:00.800 --> 18:02.166
I don't know.

18:04.033 --> 18:06.967
Lime Jell-o with pears
or fresh lemon meringue pie?

18:07.033 --> 18:08.033
Pie.

18:08.100 --> 18:10.867
We don't have any.
We never did.

18:10.934 --> 18:12.734
Now we're even.

18:21.166 --> 18:22.900
Oh, any luck?

18:22.967 --> 18:24.500
-What?
-Have you found her?

18:24.567 --> 18:27.233
Yes. About a half hour ago,

18:27.300 --> 18:30.533
but I've hidden her again
so you can find her.

18:34.734 --> 18:36.200
The Dow was down again.

18:36.266 --> 18:38.667
I told my broker
to short my hi-tech holdings

18:38.734 --> 18:41.066
and put it into precious metals.

18:41.133 --> 18:43.233
Hey, you sound like doctors.

18:45.734 --> 18:48.700
Can you find out
why I was left on this elevator?

18:48.767 --> 18:50.533
You were left here?

18:50.600 --> 18:51.433
What's your name?

18:51.500 --> 18:54.166
Read it yourself
right here on the bracelet.

18:54.233 --> 18:57.667
"Zulu, queen of the dwarf people."

19:00.800 --> 19:02.967
Petrillo's the name.
Sophia Petrillo.

19:03.033 --> 19:06.633
-Get me out of here.
-Who is your insurance company?

19:06.700 --> 19:09.300
Lloyds of London.

19:09.367 --> 19:11.033
What do I look like?
I'm on Medicare.

19:15.000 --> 19:17.734
We'll tell the desk.
They'll send somebody.

19:59.433 --> 20:00.767
Oh, you're up.

20:02.934 --> 20:04.100
Rose?

20:04.166 --> 20:06.000
While you were sleeping,
I've been thinking.

20:06.066 --> 20:08.867
There's something
I have to know.

20:08.934 --> 20:11.166
You said you chose God.

20:11.233 --> 20:14.433
How could you when it meant
giving up your child?

20:14.500 --> 20:16.433
I never knew about a child.

20:16.500 --> 20:18.233
After you were living
with the Lindstroms,

20:18.300 --> 20:20.600
I found out about Ingrid.

20:20.667 --> 20:24.233
By then, I didn't want to interfere
with your new life.

20:24.300 --> 20:25.333
I'm sorry.

20:25.400 --> 20:28.333
You don't need to be sorry.

20:28.400 --> 20:30.066
In fact, I should thank you.

20:30.133 --> 20:32.867
-For what?
-For giving me life!

20:32.934 --> 20:34.567
And it's been a great one.

20:34.633 --> 20:37.700
The Lindstroms
were wonderful parents,

20:37.767 --> 20:41.834
I had a wonderful husband,
I have beautiful children,

20:41.900 --> 20:43.333
and I owe it all to you.

20:43.400 --> 20:44.800
I have grandchildren?

20:44.867 --> 20:47.800
Yes.
I bet they'd love to know you.

20:47.867 --> 20:51.800
Oh, my. So would I.

20:51.867 --> 20:54.266
Rose, have you seen my mother?

20:54.333 --> 20:57.066
Dad, these are my roommates,
Dorothy and Blanche.

20:57.133 --> 20:58.633
Hello there.

20:58.700 --> 21:00.767
Rose has told me about you.

21:00.834 --> 21:02.867
I know it's late for me to start
acting like a father,

21:02.934 --> 21:06.934
but could you stop hitting
my little girl with the newspaper?

21:09.767 --> 21:11.700
-We'll try.
-We'll try.

21:13.166 --> 21:14.667
You'll have to excuse us.

21:14.734 --> 21:16.200
Rose, can you help?

21:16.266 --> 21:17.800
We're searching the hospital.

21:17.867 --> 21:19.433
We can't find my mother.

21:19.500 --> 21:21.133
Maybe she's lost.

21:23.433 --> 21:26.433
That-a-girl, Rose.
You finally got one.

21:26.934 --> 21:29.333
-Nice meeting you, sir.
-Bye-bye.

21:29.400 --> 21:31.166
Thanks, Dad.

21:41.800 --> 21:44.100
You don't have to go through
with this.

21:44.166 --> 21:47.266
I never thought I'd be looking
for my mother in the morgue.

21:47.333 --> 21:51.433
The last words I said to her were,
"Shut up, Zulu."

21:56.333 --> 21:59.200
I just wish I was lost
instead of ma.

21:59.266 --> 22:01.533
You'd be a lot easier to find.

22:02.000 --> 22:05.100
-Ma! Oh, Ma.
-We've been worried sick.

22:05.166 --> 22:07.133
Easy, easy, easy!

22:07.200 --> 22:08.867
Not healed. Not healed.

22:08.934 --> 22:09.834
Not healed.

22:09.900 --> 22:11.300
Where have you been?

22:11.367 --> 22:12.633
Why are you on this elevator?

22:12.700 --> 22:15.667
I'm into easy-listening.
How the hell should I know?

22:15.734 --> 22:19.033
What difference does it make?
We found you!

22:19.100 --> 22:21.000
What a day this has been.

22:21.066 --> 22:24.633
I found my father.
You found your mother.

22:24.700 --> 22:26.934
And I found you can't
give a sponge bath

22:27.000 --> 22:29.033
without the patient's consent.

22:31.133 --> 22:32.767
Oh, Ma, I'm so sorry
about everything.

22:32.834 --> 22:35.200
I'm sorry
I asked you to move that sofa.

22:35.266 --> 22:36.767
I'm sorry you're sick.

22:36.834 --> 22:39.633
I'll never ask you
to move furniture again.

22:39.700 --> 22:42.800
I'm just so happy you're safe.

22:42.867 --> 22:44.934
Speaking of God,
I made a little promise

22:45.000 --> 22:47.467
that if he got me
through this operation,

22:47.533 --> 22:50.066
I'd tell the truth
how I got this hernia.

22:50.133 --> 22:52.200
Not lifting the sofa?

22:52.266 --> 22:54.600
Oh, please. It's Wicker.

22:56.800 --> 22:59.100
A few of us thought
it would be funny

22:59.166 --> 23:01.300
to put Gladys' VW on the lawn

23:01.367 --> 23:05.767
while she was having
her feet sanded,

23:05.834 --> 23:08.700
and that's why I'm on this gurney,
pussycat.

23:08.767 --> 23:10.867
Aw, Ma, it's ok.

23:10.934 --> 23:13.033
As long as I found you.

23:13.100 --> 23:15.100
Rose, push morgue.

23:24.500 --> 23:27.700
(theme music playing)
