00:01.835 --> 00:04.504
- STEPH: Okay, ready to see
our Halloween costumes?

00:07.632 --> 00:10.760
- You're going as
splattered entrails?

00:10.844 --> 00:16.099
- I'm bacon and you guys
are gonna be eggs.

00:16.181 --> 00:18.810
We're trick or treating
as a family breakfast.

00:18.893 --> 00:21.938
You're the jumbo egg.
- Jumbo? Seriously?

00:22.021 --> 00:23.273
To a teenaged girl?

00:23.356 --> 00:25.775
You ain't that new here.

00:25.859 --> 00:28.027
- Bacon and eggs doesn't seem
like a scary costume.

00:28.111 --> 00:31.698
- Come on, James.
You'll be high cholesterol.

00:31.781 --> 00:33.199
That's the silent killer.

00:33.283 --> 00:35.994
Woooo! I've come
to stop your blood!

00:36.077 --> 00:37.996
- So, does this mean
you're not doing

00:38.079 --> 00:40.039
your thing on
the porch this year?

00:40.123 --> 00:42.041
- Oh, no, I have
to do that.

00:42.125 --> 00:43.752
I'm going for first place

00:43.835 --> 00:45.795
on neighborhood
trickortreat.com.

00:45.879 --> 00:48.006
Oh, I came so close
last year,

00:48.089 --> 00:50.383
'til the Maharys dressed up
their little wiener dog

00:50.467 --> 00:52.427
as a balloon animal.

00:52.510 --> 00:54.512
So, I can't trick
or treat with you.

00:54.596 --> 00:56.097
But between doorbells,

00:56.181 --> 00:58.183
I'm up for whatever
you've got.

00:58.266 --> 00:59.642
What have you got?

00:59.726 --> 01:01.770
- Bobbing for apples.
Witches' ring toss.

01:01.853 --> 01:04.147
And my favorite
part of Halloween--

01:04.230 --> 01:05.690
pumpkin carving.

01:05.774 --> 01:08.443
- All that?
And carving pumpkins?

01:08.526 --> 01:10.403
Mind blown.

01:10.487 --> 01:12.405
- You're darn right
it's blown

01:12.489 --> 01:14.491
because this party
is going to be awesome.

01:14.574 --> 01:16.284
And, of course, the evening

01:16.367 --> 01:18.328
will culminate with
trick or treating.

01:18.411 --> 01:20.079
- I don't know, Steph.

01:20.163 --> 01:21.998
I have a big report due
on photosynthesis.

01:22.081 --> 01:25.668
If I come to your party,
I won't be able to finish it.

01:25.752 --> 01:28.254
I'm in!

01:28.338 --> 01:30.924
- You know what, Steph?
This sounds like fun.

01:31.007 --> 01:32.634
I'll go as sexy egg.

01:32.717 --> 01:34.761
I'll cut out the yolk,
show a little midriff,

01:34.844 --> 01:36.387
maybe some fishnets.

01:36.471 --> 01:38.389
- Forget about it.
You're going as a waffle.

01:38.473 --> 01:41.017
- Okay, sexy waffle.
Cut a couple of squares.

01:41.100 --> 01:44.687
Show a little midriff.
Maybe some fishnets.

01:44.771 --> 01:46.356
- You know what?

01:46.439 --> 01:48.358
You're going as shut-in teenaged
girl in a suit of armor.

01:48.441 --> 01:52.362
- Hey, cut through the chain
mail, show a little midriff.

01:52.445 --> 01:59.869

- No, I'm an open heart--

02:19.848 --> 02:22.976
{\an8}Aw. I love this costume!

02:23.059 --> 02:26.604
{\an8}I never get to have any fun with
the gory parts of my job.

02:26.688 --> 02:28.064

those trick or treaters

02:32.735 --> 02:34.404
{\an8}however you like.

02:34.487 --> 02:36.489
{\an8}Just make sure you pop in
for the pumpkin carving.

02:36.573 --> 02:38.241
{\an8}- Oh, can I use my scalpel?

02:38.324 --> 02:39.742
{\an8}- No, you have to use
one of these cute,

02:39.826 --> 02:41.077
{\an8}teeny weeny pumpkin knives.

02:41.161 --> 02:44.330
{\an8}They come with the carving
kit for a reason.

02:44.414 --> 02:45.748
{\an8}- Yeah, the reason
is they break

02:45.832 --> 02:48.042
{\an8}and you have to
buy another kit.

02:48.126 --> 02:50.044
{\an8}- Just get your butt
on the porch,

02:50.128 --> 02:52.797
{\an8}Mr. Know-It-All.
- Dr. Know-It-All.

02:52.881 --> 02:54.465
{\an8}- Hey, where are my eggs?

02:54.549 --> 02:58.803
{\an8}We need to get crackin'.
- Oh, ho!

02:58.887 --> 03:00.805
{\an8}- Hey, medium-sized egg,

03:00.889 --> 03:02.307
{\an8}why aren't you
medium-sized egg?

03:02.390 --> 03:03.850
{\an8}- I sat on a wall
and had a great fall.

03:03.933 --> 03:06.686
{\an8}Now I'm a zombie mortician.

03:06.769 --> 03:08.938
{\an8}- Okay, you're kind of
ruining the theme--

03:09.022 --> 03:10.607
{\an8}Bacon, eggs,
and rotting flesh

03:10.690 --> 03:11.900
{\an8}isn't exactly
a balanced breakfast.

03:11.983 --> 03:14.319
{\an8}- I'm sorry, Steph,
but I'm out.

03:14.402 --> 03:16.487
{\an8}I'm doing a Haunted
House in the garage.

03:16.571 --> 03:18.197
- Since when?

03:18.281 --> 03:20.283
- Since I realized how much
the church makes off theirs.

03:20.366 --> 03:21.868
I can charge
two bucks a head,

03:21.951 --> 03:23.703
plus donations to
the needy children--

03:23.786 --> 03:26.289
as in I "needy" some money.

03:26.372 --> 03:28.541
- Okay, but what about
our family party?

03:28.625 --> 03:31.336
I...I had this
whole thing planned.

03:31.419 --> 03:33.296
- I don't know,
the apple bob,

03:33.379 --> 03:35.298
pumpkin thing sounded
kind of childish.

03:35.381 --> 03:37.342
- Pumpkin carving childish?

03:37.425 --> 03:40.637
This says ages eight
to eighty.

03:40.720 --> 03:42.722
- When you finish carving one,
bring it out to the garage.

03:42.805 --> 03:45.224
I can use it as
a spooky cash box.

03:45.308 --> 03:49.228
Money goes in,
but it doesn't come out.

03:49.312 --> 03:50.647
- Sorry, honey.

03:50.730 --> 03:52.815
But the rest of us
will do your Halloween stuff.

03:52.899 --> 03:55.318
- Oh, honey, I don't
want the rest of us.

03:55.401 --> 03:56.986
I want all of us.

03:57.070 --> 03:59.155
I've been looking forward
to this big family Halloween

03:59.238 --> 04:00.698
ever since I got
this big family.

04:00.782 --> 04:02.700
It's half the reason
I married you.

04:02.784 --> 04:06.496
- Is the other half
my deadside manner?

04:06.579 --> 04:08.498
- BOTH: [laughing]

04:08.581 --> 04:09.707
- Oh, cute outfit.

04:09.791 --> 04:12.460
It's almost a shame to cover
it up with an egg costume.

04:12.543 --> 04:14.337
- That's why I'm not gonna.

04:14.420 --> 04:15.338
Noah and Molly
are coming over.

04:15.421 --> 04:18.173
- Oh, I guess the costumes
aren't important--

04:18.257 --> 04:21.761
especially when we're getting
two more people at our partay.

04:21.844 --> 04:24.389
- Hold your happy.

04:24.472 --> 04:27.225
We'll kind of be
partay adjacent.

04:27.308 --> 04:30.269
- Really?
First, James, now you?

04:30.353 --> 04:32.897
It's not really a party
if everybody's all adjacent.

04:32.981 --> 04:34.607
- Noah's bringing
over a movie.

04:34.691 --> 04:36.067
Halloween is kinda
for kids, anyway.

04:36.150 --> 04:36.943
- Wait, why do you guys
keep saying that?

04:37.026 --> 04:41.406
You're kids!
It's for you!

04:41.489 --> 04:44.075
Can you believe everyone's
abandoning me, Charlie?

04:44.158 --> 04:45.827
Charlie?

04:50.164 --> 04:53.459
- Look at me
scrambling myself.

04:55.461 --> 04:59.007
- I could just eat you up.
But I won't.

04:59.090 --> 05:02.051
- Yeah, I am a lot of egg.

05:02.135 --> 05:04.595
- Yes, plus, we've
got a full schedule.

05:04.679 --> 05:06.556
We are going to bob
for apples,

05:06.639 --> 05:08.391
make scarecrows of ourselves.

05:08.474 --> 05:10.560
I even went out
and got hay.

05:10.643 --> 05:12.145
Hay!

05:12.228 --> 05:14.147
- When do we go
trick or treating?

05:14.230 --> 05:16.024
- That comes last, remember?

05:16.107 --> 05:18.026
I said the evening would
culminate in trick or treating.

05:18.109 --> 05:21.487
- I like how you thought
I would know what that meant.

05:21.571 --> 05:23.281
- [knock at door]
- Oh.

05:23.364 --> 05:25.742
The candy's in the front.

05:25.825 --> 05:27.410
- Hey, Mrs. Phillips.
- Hi.

05:27.493 --> 05:29.078
- Well, well, well...

05:29.162 --> 05:33.082
if it isn't the
too-cool-for-Halloween crowd.

05:33.166 --> 05:37.253
Gabby's in the living room.
Fun adjacent.

05:37.336 --> 05:38.296
- Oh, you guys are
gonna bob for apples?

05:38.379 --> 05:41.758
- We used to do that when
I was a little kid.

05:41.841 --> 05:45.344
- Little kid? Do you
think I'm too old for this?

05:45.428 --> 05:48.097
- No. What are you,
like seven?

05:48.181 --> 05:51.142
- [gritting teeth]
I'm nine.

05:51.225 --> 05:52.810
- Oh.

05:52.894 --> 05:54.437
- Yeah, this'll probably
be my last year

05:54.520 --> 05:55.271
for all this
Halloween stuff.

05:55.354 --> 05:57.940
- Oh, you don't mean
that, sweetie.

05:58.024 --> 05:59.609
You love Halloween.

05:59.692 --> 06:01.486
See what you did?
Get in the living room--

06:01.569 --> 06:05.573
both of you--before you
ruin Christmas, too.

06:05.656 --> 06:07.950
- Hey, Gabby.
We've got the movie.

06:08.034 --> 06:10.119
- Oh, hold on a sec.
Gabby's doing some thing for me.

06:10.203 --> 06:12.288
- Dad, I'm not gonna
rate my own house.

06:12.371 --> 06:13.831
That's cheating.

06:13.915 --> 06:16.000
- Not if you use Molly's phone.
Molly, give her your phone.

06:16.084 --> 06:19.378
- [doorbell ringing]
- KIDS: Trick or treat!

06:19.462 --> 06:21.464
- Uh, don't give me
a rating yet! I'm coming!

06:21.547 --> 06:23.299
Oh, I never should have
left my post.

06:23.382 --> 06:25.802
- I saw some kids from our class
out there trick or treating.

06:25.885 --> 06:28.304
- Seriously?
How pathetic is that?

06:28.387 --> 06:31.140
- Yeah, who likes free candy?

06:31.224 --> 06:33.142
- So, what movie
did you bring?

06:33.226 --> 06:36.312
- "Nosferatu."
- Oh, good choice, babe.

06:36.395 --> 06:38.356
What is it, babe?
[laughing]

06:38.439 --> 06:39.982
- It's a vampire movie.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.151
- Ooh, great.
Shirtless dudes sparkling.

06:42.235 --> 06:43.486
I can get with that.

06:43.569 --> 06:47.824
- Actually, it's a silent German
film from the 1920s.

06:47.907 --> 06:50.159
My older sister says
it's awesome.

06:50.243 --> 06:52.161
- Oh... [laughing]
Silent.

06:52.245 --> 06:54.497
It sounds very
sophisticated.

06:54.580 --> 07:00.169
- How can it sound anything?
It's silent.

07:00.253 --> 07:02.213
- Noah and I think
it's cool.

07:02.296 --> 07:04.674
- All right,
silent film it is.

it last year, Dr. Phillips?

Well, I'm out.

09:44.917 --> 09:46.877
- You're gonna miss
the ending.

09:46.961 --> 09:48.671
- I doubt it.

09:48.754 --> 09:51.007
- I've always liked
that girl.

09:51.090 --> 09:54.552
I'm still iffy
about you.

09:54.635 --> 09:57.847
- Maggie, you're supposed to
be passing out candy.

09:57.930 --> 09:59.849
- Your candy ran off.

09:59.932 --> 10:02.184
As did your candy bowl.

10:02.268 --> 10:03.686
- That was all I had.

10:03.769 --> 10:05.855
My trick or treat ranking
is gonna tank.

10:05.938 --> 10:07.690
Look, the Maharys
are way ahead of me.

10:07.773 --> 10:11.986
- That's because they dressed
their dog up as a cat.

10:12.069 --> 10:17.199
Oh, little rascal's confused,
but adorable.

10:17.283 --> 10:19.035
- I can't beat that.

10:19.118 --> 10:21.746
And now I have no candy.

10:21.829 --> 10:24.290
James! He's got to be hiding
candy up in his room.

10:24.373 --> 10:25.916
He's hiding everything else.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.127
Maybe I'll find the key
to my lock box.

10:28.210 --> 10:30.796
Also, my lock box!

10:30.880 --> 10:35.217
- Ya oughta be looking for
a dog dressed up like a cat.

10:35.301 --> 10:37.303
[heavy sigh]
Oh, the bald one

10:37.386 --> 10:41.557
and those teenagers
are boring!

10:41.640 --> 10:42.725
So, what are you up to?

10:42.808 --> 10:44.435
- We're making scarecrows
of ourselves.

10:44.518 --> 10:47.730
Scarecrow Stephanie,
you are working these pants!

10:47.813 --> 10:50.066
What your number is?

10:50.149 --> 10:52.234
We're having fun,
huh, Aaron?

10:52.318 --> 10:54.904
- Heck, yeah, we are.
But have we finished yet?

10:54.987 --> 10:56.197
I wanna go
trick or treating.

10:56.280 --> 10:58.574
- We will, but first we
have to carve the pumpkins.

10:58.657 --> 10:59.992
It's not Halloween
without them.

11:00.076 --> 11:02.328
- It's not Halloween
without trick or treating.

11:02.411 --> 11:03.704
Take the boy out.

11:03.788 --> 11:06.832
- Come on. All the good
candy will be gone.

11:06.916 --> 11:08.167
And they'll just have
the knock-offs

11:08.250 --> 11:11.587
like Two Musketeers
and Feet Tarts.

11:11.670 --> 11:15.341
- Aaron, we can buy
candy any time,

11:15.424 --> 11:16.926
but we can't buy memories.

11:17.009 --> 11:19.345
- The only memories
this boy will have

11:19.428 --> 11:23.474
is that you didn't
take him trick or treating.

11:23.557 --> 11:25.184
- Fine. We'll go.

11:25.267 --> 11:27.686
But, first, can we just carve
one little pumpkin each?

11:27.770 --> 11:28.979
- That can be fun.

11:29.063 --> 11:31.774
- [straining]
Here's yours.

11:31.857 --> 11:34.527
[louder straining]
And here's mine.

11:37.947 --> 11:39.490
- Welcome...

11:39.573 --> 11:41.325
to death!

11:41.409 --> 11:44.286
Prepare to feel the horrors
of the afterlife.

11:44.370 --> 11:45.371
- Okay.

11:45.454 --> 11:47.665
- But, first, a disclaimer.

11:47.748 --> 11:50.876
The Haunter is not liable for
any medical issues

11:50.960 --> 11:53.212
this Hauntee may suffer
during or after

11:53.295 --> 11:55.339
his or her haunted
experience.

11:58.300 --> 12:00.094
You're not pregnant
are you?

12:00.177 --> 12:02.138
- I don't think so.

12:02.221 --> 12:06.267
- In that case,
prepare to feel death!

12:06.350 --> 12:10.187
Your nightmare begins!

12:10.271 --> 12:13.023
As your zombie mortician,

12:13.107 --> 12:14.817
I will have to pull
out your brains...

12:14.900 --> 12:17.319
just like these!
- [hand splats gooey stuff]

12:17.403 --> 12:20.030
- Is this macaroni?

12:20.114 --> 12:21.949
- No, it's...

12:22.032 --> 12:24.201
brains.

12:24.285 --> 12:29.623
And these are the cold
eyeballs of the dead.

12:29.707 --> 12:30.332
- Those are grapes.

12:30.416 --> 12:33.836
They're still in a bunch.

12:33.919 --> 12:37.089
Dude, this Haunted
House is lame.

12:37.173 --> 12:41.177
- I know you didn't just
call my grandbaby lame.

12:41.260 --> 12:43.345
- This Haunted House
is a rip-off.

12:43.429 --> 12:45.681
- Say it again! Say it again!

12:45.764 --> 12:49.185
And I'll rip something
off of you.

12:49.268 --> 12:52.771
I'm thinking about
those ears.

12:52.855 --> 12:56.484
- [gasping]

12:56.567 --> 12:59.153
[screaming]

12:59.236 --> 13:01.405
- [laughing]
My!

13:01.489 --> 13:03.532
- Grandma Maggie,
you terrified him.

13:03.616 --> 13:09.872
- Ha, a whole bag of candy
and traumatizing children?

13:09.955 --> 13:16.879
James, this Halloween
is shaping up real nice.

13:16.962 --> 13:19.673
You need to tighten up
weave, though, baby.

13:21.675 --> 13:25.387
- Okay, almost done
carving the smile.

13:25.471 --> 13:27.848
I've just gotta do
one last dimple.

13:27.932 --> 13:28.766
How's it going back
there, Aaron?

13:28.849 --> 13:30.601
I wonder if you call it
a Jack-o-Lantern

13:30.684 --> 13:33.062
before it has
a candle in it?

13:33.145 --> 13:35.231
Or is it just a Jack-o?

13:35.314 --> 13:36.899
- Steph, who are
you talking to?

13:36.982 --> 13:38.484
- Aaron.
- Scarecrow Aaron?

13:38.567 --> 13:40.778
'Cause that's the only
Aaron that's here.

13:40.861 --> 13:43.072
- Where's Aaron?

13:43.155 --> 13:44.782
- I don't know,
but I could help you look.

13:44.865 --> 13:46.742
How much left
on the movie?

13:46.825 --> 13:48.661
- NOAH: Uh, 52 minutes.

13:48.744 --> 13:51.121
- I've got 52 minutes, girl.
Please keep me busy.

13:51.205 --> 13:53.165
- NOAH: I was wrong.
It's actually 62 minutes.

13:53.249 --> 13:55.251
But take your time.
I've got it on pause.

13:55.334 --> 13:57.086
- Guess you're on your own.

13:57.169 --> 13:59.088
The sooner I get back,
the sooner it ends.

13:59.171 --> 14:01.090
- Do we have any baker's
chocolate?

14:01.173 --> 14:03.008
I've gotta give
something out to the kids.

14:03.092 --> 14:05.094
- Charlie, Aaron's gone missing.
- No, he hasn't.

14:05.177 --> 14:07.054
Tommy and his mom came
to the door.

14:07.137 --> 14:09.139
He left with them
to go trick or treating.

14:09.223 --> 14:10.808
- And you let him leave?

14:10.891 --> 14:12.935
- He said you guys were done.
- No, we weren't done.

14:13.018 --> 14:13.936
- Well, maybe he said
he was done.

14:14.019 --> 14:16.939
Are these white chocolate
bunnies still good?

14:17.022 --> 14:18.941
- They were dark
chocolate bunnies

14:19.024 --> 14:19.775
when we got them, so, no.

14:19.858 --> 14:22.736
Charlie, we've got
a bigger problem.

14:22.820 --> 14:25.614
There is nothing left of
my whole family Halloween.

14:25.698 --> 14:28.450
- Baloney!
- No, really.

14:28.534 --> 14:31.161
Aaron left before we even
finished carving pumpkins.

14:31.245 --> 14:33.205
- What if I sprinkle
sugar on it?

14:33.289 --> 14:35.874
Is that weird?
I'm hearing it. It's weird.

14:35.958 --> 14:37.293
- [cellphone dings]

14:37.376 --> 14:40.212
- No, no, no, no.

14:40.296 --> 14:42.256
I'm in last place
on the whole block.

14:42.339 --> 14:44.133
It's baloney or nothin'.

14:44.216 --> 14:46.176
I've gotta go!

14:49.555 --> 14:51.599
- Next.

14:56.645 --> 14:59.106
Change? You'd better
change that to some bills.

14:59.189 --> 15:01.191
Get outta here.

15:01.275 --> 15:03.277
- Please, man,
it's all I've got.

15:03.360 --> 15:06.405
And I heard that this is
the scariest Haunted House ever.

15:06.488 --> 15:09.366
[sighs]
Okay, fine.

15:09.450 --> 15:12.286
- That's more like it.

15:12.369 --> 15:14.496
Welcome to your nightmare.

15:14.580 --> 15:17.541
- [recorded thunder crashing]

15:17.625 --> 15:21.337
- And what the heck
are you supposed to be?

15:21.420 --> 15:24.131
- A...a robot?

15:24.214 --> 15:25.007
- A robot?

15:25.090 --> 15:30.387
In that tired piece
of cardboard? Ha!

15:30.471 --> 15:34.850
You'd better go home
and do your homework,

15:34.933 --> 15:40.272
or else you're gonna end up
livin' in that box.

15:40.356 --> 15:42.358
- But my mom said--
- Your mama said!

15:42.441 --> 15:45.819
What your mama said?

15:49.990 --> 15:51.659
Are you gonna cry?

15:51.742 --> 15:53.702
Ya little baby!

15:53.786 --> 15:57.831
I'm gonna give you
somethin' to cry about!

15:59.375 --> 16:02.086
- BOY: Stop shouting!
I'll never...

16:02.169 --> 16:04.380
[screaming]
- Maggie: [screaming]

16:04.463 --> 16:07.049
- [slams door]

16:07.132 --> 16:09.134
- You're great,
Grandma Maggie.

16:09.218 --> 16:10.803
- Mmm!
- I am cleanin' up.

16:10.886 --> 16:14.223
- What you mean
you're cleaning up?

16:14.306 --> 16:16.809
Boo!

16:19.520 --> 16:22.314
- NOAH: [sighs]

16:22.398 --> 16:24.525
That was something.

16:24.608 --> 16:28.445
- [yawning] Yeah,
that was something.

16:28.529 --> 16:30.155
[laughing]
And a lot of it.

16:30.239 --> 16:31.990
- Those three hours
flew by.

16:32.074 --> 16:35.077
- It was only 94 minutes.
- Really?

16:35.160 --> 16:37.079
Because it felt
like forever.

16:37.162 --> 16:37.871
- Oh, I'm so glad
you said that

16:37.955 --> 16:40.624
because I spent
the last half

16:40.708 --> 16:42.751
trying to figure out
how to dump you.

16:42.835 --> 16:44.420
- BOTH: [laughing]

16:44.503 --> 16:46.755
- I just can't believe
that movie was so terrible.

16:46.839 --> 16:49.883
My sister loved it.
- Your sister wears a beret.

16:52.177 --> 16:53.262
- Good point.

16:53.345 --> 16:55.180
You know, if we're
being honest,

16:55.264 --> 16:56.265
I miss Halloween.
- Really?

16:56.348 --> 16:59.768
- Because it looks like it puked
all over my house.

16:59.852 --> 17:00.811
- Think your stepmom's got
any apples left to bob?

17:00.894 --> 17:03.647
- We could check
in the kitchen.

17:03.731 --> 17:05.523
- Last one in there has to
watch "Nosferatu" again.

17:05.607 --> 17:07.693
- Get outta my way!
- Wait! No, no, no!

17:09.069 --> 17:11.696
- And make sure you tell
your mom or your stepmom

17:11.780 --> 17:14.616
how important she is to you.

17:14.700 --> 17:15.742
Ah! Don't you roll
your eyes, Frankenstein.

17:15.826 --> 17:20.038
You'd better be taking notes.

17:20.122 --> 17:21.957
That's right--run away.

17:22.040 --> 17:24.792
The truth is terrifying!

17:24.877 --> 17:27.463
- Honey, I'm the one who's
supposed to be scaring the kids.

17:27.546 --> 17:28.797
- Oh, you're scaring
them, all right--

17:28.881 --> 17:30.716
with that sugared baloney.

17:30.799 --> 17:32.468
- Shhhhh!

17:32.551 --> 17:35.345
They're lickable
meat discs.

17:36.805 --> 17:39.516
Actually, they're not bad.

17:39.600 --> 17:41.727
Ha! Ha! Take that, Maharys!
And your little dog, too!

17:41.810 --> 17:44.646
- Honey, I was just starting

17:44.730 --> 17:46.690
to get the hang of this
mothering thing

17:46.774 --> 17:48.525
and now I've got no
one left to mother.

17:48.609 --> 17:50.527
- Oh, honey, Aaron's
still little.

17:50.611 --> 17:52.488
He's gonna need you
for a long time.

17:52.571 --> 17:54.615
I cannot believe these
neighborhood kids!

17:54.698 --> 17:59.161
My skeleton is not
a trash can!

17:59.244 --> 18:01.330
- He's already
pulling away.

18:01.413 --> 18:04.458
We always used to share
a cinnamon bun at the mall.

18:04.541 --> 18:06.335
Last week,
he wanted his own.

18:06.418 --> 18:08.212
- Well, so?
- So?

18:08.295 --> 18:10.506
Cinnamon buns are
huge and shameful.

18:10.589 --> 18:11.882
But Aaron and I
split the shame.

18:11.965 --> 18:14.843
This time, I had
to eat my own shame.

18:14.927 --> 18:17.429
- You didn't have
to eat your whole shame.

18:17.513 --> 18:19.014
- Of course, I did.
Those things are delicious.

18:19.097 --> 18:22.184
And I felt so bad about it,
I ate a second one.

18:22.267 --> 18:25.145
It was like eating a hug.

18:25.229 --> 18:26.438
Three hugs.

18:26.522 --> 18:28.190
Okay, I had three.

18:28.273 --> 18:31.401
Charlie, I just wish the kids
wouldn't grow up quite so fast.

18:31.485 --> 18:33.862
- Well, kids have a way
of doing that.

18:33.946 --> 18:37.157
I'm still getting
used to it.

18:37.241 --> 18:40.869
I try to think of it as part
of growing up as a parent.

18:40.953 --> 18:42.996
- Best Halloween ever!

18:43.080 --> 18:44.540
Check out all
the candy I got.

18:44.623 --> 18:47.918
Steph, I told my friends how
awesome our party was.

18:48.001 --> 18:49.753
Can you show them how
to bob for apples?

18:49.837 --> 18:51.547
- You know I can.

18:51.630 --> 18:53.549
Party in here.
Ain't nothin' out there.

18:53.632 --> 18:56.593
[laughing]

18:59.346 --> 19:00.138
- Meat disc?

19:02.474 --> 19:05.227
- Steph, the Halloween party
is off the hook.

19:05.310 --> 19:07.771
- Aw, you guys
are doing Halloween?

19:07.855 --> 19:09.898
- It turns out we're not
as mature as we thought.

19:09.982 --> 19:12.442
- Hey, speak for yourself.

19:12.526 --> 19:16.989
Oh, whoopee, ghost cookies!

19:17.072 --> 19:20.367
- Steph, Grandma Maggie took
all my Haunted House money.

19:20.450 --> 19:21.785
- Oh, stop your whining.

19:21.869 --> 19:23.495
I will give you
what you deserve.

19:23.579 --> 19:27.249
- No fair! I deserve
more than I deserve.

19:27.332 --> 19:28.125
How about we apple
bob for it?

19:28.208 --> 19:30.919
- I might just help
you stay under.

19:31.003 --> 19:33.881
If you get my drift.

19:33.964 --> 19:37.175
- Why don't we just
play ring toss?

19:37.259 --> 19:40.053
- Looks like you got exactly
the Halloween you wanted.

19:40.137 --> 19:41.513
- Aw, thank you, doctor.

19:41.597 --> 19:43.390
- You know, doctors and bacon
may be enemies,

19:43.473 --> 19:46.602
but I can't help wanting
to take a nibble.

19:46.685 --> 19:49.563
