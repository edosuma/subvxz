You gotta be kidding me.
[shifts gear]

00:29.449 --> 00:33.118
Hey.
That's my spot.

00:33.153 --> 00:36.087
- I don't see your name on it.
- You cut me off.

00:36.123 --> 00:39.591
- You got a problem?
- Your car in my spot.

00:39.626 --> 00:40.892
What are you gonna do about it?

00:40.927 --> 00:42.761
Come on.
Don't be an asshole.

00:42.796 --> 00:46.464
- What did you call me?
- You heard me.

00:53.940 --> 00:56.941
<i>- What's wrong?
- What happened?</i>

01:11.857 --> 01:13.209
<i>IÂ´m sorry.</i>

01:17.564 --> 01:19.931
Hello?

01:19.966 --> 01:21.432
<i>Surprise!</i>

01:22.836 --> 01:25.069
Presenting...

01:25.105 --> 01:27.138
the president of the New England
Medical Officers...

01:27.174 --> 01:28.673
Dr. Maura Isles.

01:28.708 --> 01:31.409
Well, technically,
I'm the president-elect.

01:31.444 --> 01:34.546
Congratulations, president-elect.

01:34.581 --> 01:36.614
Wait! No, Ma!
It's gonna go everywhere.

01:36.650 --> 01:40.084
Please.
This is not my first rodeo.

01:40.120 --> 01:42.020
I just got elected.
How do you all know about this?

01:42.055 --> 01:44.155
Oh, they called to ask
how to engrave the plaque,

01:44.191 --> 01:45.623
and I had to tell someone.

01:45.659 --> 01:48.960
- So she told me, and I told...
- Everyone.

01:48.995 --> 01:50.428
<i>Of course he did.</i>

01:50.463 --> 01:52.463
<i>After all, she's the New England...</i>

01:52.499 --> 01:54.499
<i>- What is it?
- Uh, it's an ethics committee.</i>

01:54.534 --> 01:57.101
They review and they publish
cases of interest

01:57.137 --> 01:58.770
to the medical community at large.

01:58.805 --> 02:01.639
And dr. Isles is
the first president-elect

02:01.675 --> 02:03.908
in the field of forensic pathology.

02:03.944 --> 02:07.378
Yes, and the first
whose patients are all dead.

02:07.414 --> 02:08.913
Yes.

02:08.949 --> 02:11.382
Well, we used to be the outcasts
of the medical community.

02:11.418 --> 02:13.785
Not long ago, a medical degree
wasn't even required

02:13.905 --> 02:16.821
- to be certified, so...
- This is a really big deal.

02:16.857 --> 02:19.858
And N.E.M.O. is very lucky to have you.

02:19.893 --> 02:22.694
Wait.

02:24.564 --> 02:25.997
Nemo?

02:26.032 --> 02:27.799
Oh, no relation to
the vengeful submarine captain

02:27.834 --> 02:30.702
with a bitter hatred 
for British imperialism.

02:31.705 --> 02:35.573
Why is everyone
looking at me like that?

02:35.609 --> 02:38.576
Oh, Nemo's the little
striped clown fish.

02:38.612 --> 02:40.812
With the tiny, tiny fin.

02:40.847 --> 02:43.081
Jack, tell me I'm not alone.

02:43.116 --> 02:45.617
I might've read it in high school?

02:45.652 --> 02:47.752
Oh, come on. Who cares?

02:47.787 --> 02:50.154
This is a party, not a book report.

02:50.190 --> 02:52.023
To you, Maura!

02:52.058 --> 02:53.791
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

02:55.595 --> 02:57.495
Mmm! Cake!

02:57.530 --> 03:00.431
<i>Aw!</i>

03:00.467 --> 03:04.936
- You okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine. Why?

03:04.971 --> 03:07.071
You just downed that like
somebody was chasing you.

03:07.107 --> 03:10.375
Oh.
Um... it's delicious.

03:10.410 --> 03:11.709
<i>Oh, we need a cake knife.</i>

03:11.745 --> 03:12.977
- Scalpels are clean.
- Oh.

03:13.013 --> 03:14.512
<i>Oh, wait. Whoa. Whoa.</i>

03:14.547 --> 03:16.814
I am all up for
dead people getting props,

03:16.850 --> 03:19.117
but I draw the line at autopsy tools.

03:19.152 --> 03:21.786
Ma, back me up on this!

03:21.821 --> 03:25.056
Whoa! What I could do to
a pork chop with these things.

03:27.894 --> 03:30.094
Rizzoli.

03:32.565 --> 03:33.865
Mnh.

03:33.900 --> 03:36.801
Okay, I'll just, uh,
take this to the fridge.

03:37.136 --> 03:39.671
Not the morgue fridge.

03:39.706 --> 03:42.540
That goes anywhere near a person
with a toe tag, I'll know it.

03:42.575 --> 03:47.512
- I understand.
- I'm watching you, Chang.

03:48.848 --> 03:52.150
The morgue fridge is the only
place big enough to fit this cake.

03:52.185 --> 03:57.121
- Dead men tell no tales.
- Oh!

04:10.584 --> 04:14.067

04:15.747 --> 04:18.632
<b>5x17 - "Bite out of Crime"</b>

04:20.779 --> 04:24.615
- So can I call you Captain Nemo or not?
- Not.

04:24.651 --> 04:26.017
Well, I have to call you something.

04:26.052 --> 04:28.553
I got it.
Captain Morgan.

04:28.588 --> 04:29.887
I'm not sure a pirate theme

04:29.923 --> 04:31.155
is in line with
the committee's mission.

04:31.191 --> 04:33.224
No, I'm very sure
they're anti-scurvy.

04:33.259 --> 04:35.159
When kind of grades
do you think a pirate would make

04:35.195 --> 04:37.495
- in medical school?
- Please don't.

04:37.530 --> 04:39.897
High seas.

04:39.933 --> 04:41.966
Why didn't the pirate go to the movie?

04:42.001 --> 04:45.703
- Because it was rated "arrrr!"
- How do I make it stop?

04:45.738 --> 04:48.106
You can't! I haven't even gotten
to the booty jokes yet.

04:48.141 --> 04:50.908
Somehow, I'm gonna
make Jack pay for this.

04:50.944 --> 04:52.543
You guys all right?

04:52.579 --> 04:54.645
He didn't look like
a very Jolly Roger back there.

04:54.681 --> 04:57.682
I didn't notice.
But then I was distracted.

04:57.717 --> 05:00.485
By your reflection in the shiny,
shiny plaque? No, I get it.

05:00.520 --> 05:03.570
Thank you, by the way.
I couldn't do this work without you.

05:03.690 --> 05:05.790
My pleas-arrrr.

05:05.825 --> 05:07.992
That was a stretch.
Walk the plank.

05:08.027 --> 05:09.594
Hey, what do we got?

05:09.629 --> 05:12.196
Ned Drake.
32. Married.

05:12.232 --> 05:14.599
Owns a carpet cleaning business
on the other side of town.

05:14.634 --> 05:17.168
Witnesses saw him arguing
with another driver

05:17.203 --> 05:20.371
- right before he dropped dead.
- Road rage?

05:20.406 --> 05:22.973
Except no one saw
the other driver raise a gun.

05:23.009 --> 05:25.276
Significant tissue loss
around the entrance wound.

05:25.311 --> 05:27.678
Went clean through him.

05:27.714 --> 05:29.080
<i>- We recover the bullet?
- Not yet.</i>

05:29.115 --> 05:31.657
The other driver is Jay Clark.
He admits to stealing

05:31.777 --> 05:33.967
Ned's spot,
exchanging words, but that's it.

05:34.087 --> 05:36.354
Claims he doesn't own a gun,
says he's a pacifist.

05:36.389 --> 05:38.956
We're looking for places where
he could've ditched the gun.

05:38.991 --> 05:43.127
Trash cans, storm drains.
But no one heard a shot either.

05:44.263 --> 05:47.832
So witnesses saw the argument,
they saw him drop dead,

05:47.867 --> 05:50.267
but nobody saw a gun
or heard a shot?

05:50.303 --> 05:51.869
That's what we have.

05:53.005 --> 05:54.438
Well, he is shot, right, Maura?

05:54.474 --> 05:56.874
He wasn't run through
with a spear or something?

05:56.909 --> 05:58.843
Well, I'll need to autopsy
to confirm the cause of death,

05:58.878 --> 06:01.779
but these wounds are consistent
with a gunshot, yes.

06:01.814 --> 06:04.181
- Drive-by maybe? Stray bullet?
- It's possible.

06:04.217 --> 06:06.417
Maybe wrong place
at the wrong time?

06:06.537 --> 06:09.869
Then again, people will do anything
for a good parking spot.

06:20.233 --> 06:22.867
Hey.

06:22.902 --> 06:25.736
So we tried to call Ned's wife
to notify her of his death,

06:25.772 --> 06:27.938
but her cell phone
was in his car.

06:27.974 --> 06:29.673
- Oh?
- Yeah.

06:29.709 --> 06:31.208
Turns out she forgot it
on her way to work this morning.

06:31.244 --> 06:33.993
- He was bringing it to her.
- Well, that's nice of him.

06:34.113 --> 06:36.881
Oh, but if she hadn't
forgotten it, then...

06:36.916 --> 06:39.632
He wouldn't have been there.
Did you find anything?

06:39.752 --> 06:41.886
Well, C.S.R.U. hasn't
recovered a bullet.

06:41.921 --> 06:44.388
Uh, but the dimensions of
the entrance and exit wounds

06:44.424 --> 06:46.357
suggest a high velocity,
large caliber bullet.

06:46.392 --> 06:48.426
- What, like a rifle?
- I can't speculate what it was,

06:48.461 --> 06:51.095
but I can eliminate
the handgun family.

06:51.130 --> 06:52.430
What about a shotgun slug?

06:52.465 --> 06:54.231
Bullets in
a large game hunting caliber

06:54.267 --> 06:57.101
would've caused
more extensive damage.

06:57.136 --> 06:58.335
I can't imagine our truck driver
whipping out a rifle

06:58.371 --> 06:59.837
in the middle of an argument.

06:59.872 --> 07:02.907
And based on the angle
of the wound track,

07:02.942 --> 07:04.241
I think that
your pacifist truck driver

07:04.277 --> 07:06.243
- was telling the truth.
- What do you mean?

07:06.279 --> 07:09.313
The bullet entered
just above his heart

07:09.348 --> 07:13.651
and exited between
anterior ribs five and six.

07:13.686 --> 07:15.786
Which means
the bullet traveled down

07:15.822 --> 07:18.122
- instead of straight through.
- Which means it was likely fired

07:18.157 --> 07:20.057
from a position above
street level.

07:20.092 --> 07:21.692
How far above?

07:21.727 --> 07:23.093
Well, knowing the distance
that the bullet traveled

07:23.129 --> 07:25.166
would allow me to determine
the angle by degree.

07:25.286 --> 07:28.614
But without it, i can only say
that the shot was fired from above.

07:28.734 --> 07:31.202
So unless my truck driver
was on stilts,

07:31.237 --> 07:33.804
I'm out of suspects.

07:33.840 --> 07:35.873
Hey, that's mine.
Get outta here.

07:35.908 --> 07:37.741
No. It is my spot.

07:37.777 --> 07:39.210
Ohh!

07:39.245 --> 07:42.012
Okay, when did our crime scene
become an improv class?

07:42.048 --> 07:45.349
If I look through Ned's eyes,
I may see what we missed.

07:45.384 --> 07:47.218
All right, well, try to
stay alive long enough

07:47.253 --> 07:49.854
to help me track the shot.

07:49.889 --> 07:52.356
Lots of windows.

07:52.391 --> 07:54.692
Well, the uniforms are
going door-to-door.

07:54.727 --> 07:57.962
maybe somebody has a problem
with Ned we don't know about.

07:57.997 --> 08:01.165
Windows would allow for height,
but they're too close

08:01.200 --> 08:02.666
based on the angle
of the wound track.

08:02.702 --> 08:05.402
Yeah. The shot was fired
from farther away.

08:10.076 --> 08:12.710
- Care for a walk in the park?
- Oh, I'd love to.

08:14.080 --> 08:15.846
Wait.

08:18.751 --> 08:20.818
Streamers.

08:20.853 --> 08:23.354
Wind indicators
for long-range hunting.

08:28.961 --> 08:30.327
Any one of these trees

08:30.363 --> 08:32.863
has an unobstructed view
of the street.

08:35.268 --> 08:36.767
That's the one.

08:39.705 --> 08:42.373
Camouflage climbing pegs.

08:43.376 --> 08:45.943
Branches are perfect
for a perch.

08:45.978 --> 08:48.345
Yeah, and the distance
from the street

08:48.381 --> 08:50.814
explains why no
one heard a shot.

08:50.850 --> 08:53.017
It's a sniper's nest.

08:53.052 --> 08:56.854
Ned's death wasn't an accident.
It was a cold-blooded execution.

09:07.009 --> 09:09.086
All right, thanks.

09:09.122 --> 09:10.855
C.S.R.U. says
the area's swept clean.

09:10.890 --> 09:12.490
They couldn't even get
a boot print.

09:12.525 --> 09:14.492
- Professional.
- Could be.

09:14.527 --> 09:16.360
But who orders a hit on Ned?

09:16.396 --> 09:17.895
Well, just because it's
a professional killer

09:17.930 --> 09:19.163
doesn't mean it's
a professional hit.

09:19.198 --> 09:21.165
Ned wasn't even supposed
to be here.

09:21.200 --> 09:22.566
Professional killer,
random target?

09:22.602 --> 09:26.170
Don't say the "r" word.
It's bad for morale.

09:41.020 --> 09:43.254
Ugh. Somebody lives here.

09:43.289 --> 09:45.022
Or used to.
Ugh.

09:45.058 --> 09:47.425
Urine. Mnh.

09:47.460 --> 09:50.294
Explains why the k-9s
are all worked up.

09:50.330 --> 09:51.896
Hey, hey, hey.
Look at this.

09:55.335 --> 09:58.135
Sniper streamers.

09:58.171 --> 10:01.005
I bet that's our missing
shell casing.

10:01.040 --> 10:02.873
Yep.

10:02.909 --> 10:04.275
Large caliber.

10:04.310 --> 10:06.010
Perfect for
long-range shooting.

10:07.680 --> 10:09.280
Nice job, officer.

10:23.062 --> 10:24.628
Oh, hey!

10:24.664 --> 10:27.098
They're not hiding behind you
with more champagne, are they?

10:27.133 --> 10:28.899
Just me.

10:28.935 --> 10:30.901
Well, I hope you're here
to make up for

10:30.937 --> 10:32.903
the car ride's worth
of pirate jokes

10:32.939 --> 10:35.473
that I was subject to...
In traffic.

10:35.508 --> 10:38.209
- Pirates?
- Never mind.

10:39.479 --> 10:41.112
What's up?

10:41.147 --> 10:43.948
I...
Have some news.

10:43.983 --> 10:46.217
Bad news?

10:46.252 --> 10:48.452
Uh, great, actually.
For my ex-wife, anyway.

10:48.488 --> 10:51.055
She's been offered a job
with Nasa

10:51.090 --> 10:53.491
on the R&D team for
the latest jupiter probe.

10:53.526 --> 10:56.060
- She must be thrilled.
- It's a job of a lifetime.

10:56.095 --> 10:58.596
She's gonna be running
the Albuquerque facility.

10:58.631 --> 11:01.399
- New Mexico.
- Yeah.

11:01.434 --> 11:03.134
Our custody agreement
requires my consent

11:03.169 --> 11:06.303
for her to move Allie.
I could object, but...

11:06.339 --> 11:08.906
I hate to get in the way of
such an amazing opportunity.

11:08.941 --> 11:11.308
Now I'm working on options ...

11:11.344 --> 11:13.277
Visiting her in Albuquerque,

11:13.312 --> 11:15.479
having her come here
for holidays.

11:17.183 --> 11:22.086
But look,
I don't want this to hang over us.

11:22.121 --> 11:25.456
I'm gonna make it work out.
It's gonna be okay.

11:27.193 --> 11:29.660
I'm sure it is.

11:32.098 --> 11:33.597
The lab's processing
the shell casing.

11:33.633 --> 11:35.299
There's plenty of prints
around the encampment.

11:35.334 --> 11:37.301
So far, no match.

11:37.336 --> 11:38.936
Nina,
could you generate a list

11:38.971 --> 11:40.571
of current and ex-military
snipers in the area?

11:40.606 --> 11:43.574
Could be a loose canon using
civilians for target practice.

11:43.609 --> 11:45.209
Give me a few minutes.

11:45.244 --> 11:47.511
If the guy's military,
his prints would be on file.

11:47.547 --> 11:49.313
That den didn't belong
to our sniper.

11:49.348 --> 11:51.916
Whoever lived there just had
the casing and the streamers

11:51.951 --> 11:53.184
for some reason.

11:53.219 --> 11:54.919
Maybe he had a partner.
A lookout?

11:54.954 --> 11:58.055
Possible, but atypical.
Snipers like to work alone.

11:58.090 --> 12:00.991
Just their god complexes
keeping them company.

12:01.027 --> 12:02.426
What worries me is that

12:02.462 --> 12:04.495
the typical sniper doesn't stop
after one victim.

12:11.904 --> 12:13.270
You get something
off the shell casing?

12:13.306 --> 12:15.005
It's standard.
Winchester.

12:15.041 --> 12:18.209
.30-06. Factory made.
Available everywhere.

12:18.244 --> 12:20.578
- No matching print, I'm guessing.
- Unfortunately.

12:20.613 --> 12:23.147
But it's the gunpowder that
I wanted to talk to you about.

12:23.182 --> 12:24.582
I found a chemical additive

12:24.617 --> 12:27.084
that might've been mixed in
by the manufacturer.

12:27.119 --> 12:29.420
Yeah, a tag. So it can be traced
if it's used in a bomb.

12:29.455 --> 12:30.888
I'll send it to A.T.F.

12:30.923 --> 12:32.423
They keep track of tags
here and abroad.

12:32.458 --> 12:34.325
There's been another shooting
at a park.

12:34.360 --> 12:37.470
- Same M.O. as our sniper?
- Yeah, looks that way.

12:44.670 --> 12:46.337
Yep.

12:46.372 --> 12:50.474
That looks just like
the first nest.

12:50.510 --> 12:53.611
The victim was Jeremy Fritz.
54. Stockbroker.

12:53.646 --> 12:56.447
He was walking to
a physical therapy appointment

12:56.482 --> 12:59.049
- when he got shot.
- Does he live nearby?

12:59.085 --> 13:00.885
No, but he works
right around the corner.

13:00.920 --> 13:03.153
He was on his lunch break.

13:03.189 --> 13:04.889
Well, anything that makes him
a likely target?

13:04.924 --> 13:06.423
Well, not according to
his coworkers.

13:06.459 --> 13:08.292
Seems like a good guy.

13:08.327 --> 13:10.349
- Just like Ned?
- No, not like Ned.

13:10.469 --> 13:12.637
Jeremy Fritz is still alive.
The bullet hit him in the shoulder.

13:12.757 --> 13:14.539
- He's in surgery.
- When can we talk to him?

13:14.659 --> 13:16.752
Soon as the doctor
gives his okay.

13:16.872 --> 13:20.420
Okay. In the meantime, let's ...
let's check into these two victims.

13:20.540 --> 13:22.523
You think there's a reason
why these guys were targeted?

13:22.643 --> 13:23.256
I hope so.

13:23.376 --> 13:26.043
If they went to the same barber
or had the same birthday,

13:26.078 --> 13:27.578
- maybe that means something.
- I'll get Nina on it.

13:27.613 --> 13:29.880
We'll start looking for
a connection right away.

13:29.916 --> 13:31.549
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

13:31.584 --> 13:35.519
Look at this,
right there in the bushes.

13:41.260 --> 13:42.560
Boston police! Freeze!

13:42.595 --> 13:44.428
<i>Go! Go!
Cover the East!</i>

13:44.463 --> 13:47.031
<i>Tell them we got a suspect...</i>

13:47.066 --> 13:48.299
<i>South side of the park!</i>

13:54.941 --> 13:57.675
Stop!

14:03.282 --> 14:04.548
<i>Come on!</i>

14:08.020 --> 14:10.054
What's your name?
What are you doing out here?

14:10.089 --> 14:12.089
<i> Hey!</i>

14:14.060 --> 14:16.660
- Did he just try to bite you?
- Yeah.

14:30.372 --> 14:33.206
Hey, hey, hey, hey.
We have your fingerprints

14:33.242 --> 14:36.009
on a shell casing connected to
the murder of Ned Drake.

14:36.044 --> 14:38.345
Did you help the shooter?
Were you his lookout?

14:39.982 --> 14:42.115
We also have your prints
on a roll of streamers

14:42.151 --> 14:44.484
used in both shootings.

14:44.520 --> 14:46.119
Hey!

14:49.391 --> 14:52.659
We can help you, okay?
But you have to talk to us.

14:55.197 --> 14:57.397
Kid, come on.
You gotta explain this.

15:02.604 --> 15:07.574
He's got no I.D., fingerprints
aren't in the system,

15:07.609 --> 15:09.042
and nothing showed up
in missing persons.

15:09.077 --> 15:12.045
So in lieu of an actual name,

15:12.080 --> 15:14.214
we're calling him McGruff.

15:14.249 --> 15:15.515
Like the crime dog?

15:15.551 --> 15:19.862
Well, it's better than buster
or spot.

15:19.982 --> 15:23.256
He just seems too erratic
to work with someone

15:23.292 --> 15:25.325
- as methodical as the shooter.
- Yeah, I thought the same thing,

15:25.360 --> 15:28.261
Which leaves us
with drugs or...

15:28.297 --> 15:29.663
Cray-cray.

15:31.033 --> 15:33.187
- This is interesting.
- Hmm.

15:34.236 --> 15:35.635
A few minutes ago,

15:35.671 --> 15:37.370
he was about to rip out
Korsak's jugular.

15:37.406 --> 15:40.502
Now he's a bored kid
in study hall? What happened?

15:41.243 --> 15:42.943
The behavior is defensive.

15:42.978 --> 15:45.645
He's relaxed when
the perceived threat is gone.

15:45.681 --> 15:48.081
Or when he thinks no one's watching.

15:48.116 --> 15:50.250
I don't think it's an act.

15:50.285 --> 15:52.219
I have a theory,
but I'll have to test it

15:52.254 --> 15:54.387
before I can make a diagnosis.

15:54.423 --> 15:57.424
I'm going to need a cheeseburger.

16:00.128 --> 16:03.029
We'll search the park in quadrants.

16:03.065 --> 16:06.333
Look for places he could
hide materials to build nests,

16:06.368 --> 16:07.934
or any evidence of any new nests
under construction.

16:07.970 --> 16:09.302
We're checking traffic cameras,

16:09.338 --> 16:11.238
but we think our guy was
hiding in plain sight.

16:11.273 --> 16:13.235
This guy built nests
and hung streamers.

16:13.355 --> 16:15.991
- Nobody noticed a thing.
- So how'd he blend in?

16:16.111 --> 16:18.578
See if any park employees
or sanitation workers

16:18.614 --> 16:22.381
have reported missing uniforms,
if any regular park visitors

16:22.501 --> 16:24.433
heard or seen anything unusual
near the nests.

16:24.553 --> 16:26.186
We need to know
if the victims' locations

16:26.221 --> 16:28.221
- had anything in common.
- Are there any chain stores,

16:28.257 --> 16:31.191
restaurants, or banks
that are near both areas?

16:31.226 --> 16:33.460
The sniper might've had a cause,
and the shootings are

16:33.495 --> 16:35.929
his way of drawing attention
to his message.

16:35.964 --> 16:37.464
<i>I'll be here for a while
if you have any questions.</i>

16:37.499 --> 16:39.366
Any news on Jeremy Fritz?

16:39.401 --> 16:41.468
Bullet caused severe vascular damage.

16:41.503 --> 16:43.603
He'll be in surgery
at least another six hours.

16:43.639 --> 16:46.473
What's the connection between

16:46.508 --> 16:48.942
- Ned Drake and Jeremy Fritz?
- They're both men,

16:48.977 --> 16:50.377
shot near the park.

16:51.513 --> 16:53.346
That's it so far.

16:53.382 --> 16:55.115
You're joking.

16:55.150 --> 16:56.398
Jeremy Fritz is

16:56.518 --> 16:58.151
a highly successful
54-year-old stockbroker.

16:58.186 --> 17:00.231
His office overlooks
the West side of Franklin Park.

17:00.351 --> 17:02.088
And Ned Drake has an office

17:02.124 --> 17:04.190
over a chinese restaurant
in Dorchester.

17:04.226 --> 17:05.892
They never called
the same number.

17:05.926 --> 17:08.295
They had no friends
or business dealings in common.

17:08.329 --> 17:11.564
They didn't go to stores or restaurants
in each other's neighborhoods.

17:11.599 --> 17:13.997
- He's picking the victims at random?
- Looks that way so far.

17:14.117 --> 17:16.306
Which means studying the victims
won't tell us anything.

17:16.425 --> 17:18.502
Then we refocus on the sniper
himself. What do we know?

17:18.622 --> 17:20.573
That's what I wanted to tell you.
The A.T.F. called.

17:20.608 --> 17:22.309
The chemical tags
in the gunpowder residue

17:22.344 --> 17:23.432
are from a german company

17:23.551 --> 17:25.612
that makes high-end powder
for... custom reloaders?

17:25.646 --> 17:28.788
They create unique mixes of powder
and make special order ammunition.

17:28.908 --> 17:31.918
I'll look for local reloaders that
buy from the German company.

17:31.953 --> 17:34.587
And we'll need a list
of the reloaders' clients.

17:34.623 --> 17:36.089
When I get their names,
I'll cross-reference addresses

17:36.124 --> 17:38.058
within a 2-mile radius
of Franklin Park.

17:38.093 --> 17:40.960
Let's hope it amounts
to something. Come on.

17:50.038 --> 17:51.604
Hi.

17:51.640 --> 17:53.139
My name is Maura.

17:53.175 --> 17:55.075
I just came to sit with you,
if that's all right.

17:57.646 --> 17:59.379
<i>Are you hungry?</i>

18:16.098 --> 18:18.932
Your hand looks like
it hurts.

18:20.202 --> 18:22.535
I'm a doctor. I can help
if you let me.

18:26.341 --> 18:29.294
It must be hard to find
enough food to eat in the park.

18:35.550 --> 18:37.750
I see you understand English.

18:41.823 --> 18:43.289
That's good.

18:46.623 --> 18:49.295
I'm here if there's anything
you wanna tell me.

18:52.133 --> 18:53.766
Like how you got hurt.

19:02.510 --> 19:04.223
The hunter.

19:07.582 --> 19:08.981
He hurt you.

19:13.688 --> 19:16.622
How did you know
he was a hunter?

19:16.657 --> 19:20.092
G-Gun.

19:20.128 --> 19:23.095
Did he give you the shell casing
and the streamers,

19:23.131 --> 19:25.631
or did you take them?
That's okay.

19:25.666 --> 19:27.099
Okay, we don't have to talk
about him if you don't want to.

19:27.135 --> 19:29.341
Okay? We can just start
at the beginning.

19:29.461 --> 19:32.271
Can you tell me your name?

19:41.983 --> 19:43.549
At least you got him to talk.

19:43.584 --> 19:45.818
Well, he might never
talk again after that.

19:45.853 --> 19:47.787
Then we'll try pizza.

19:47.822 --> 19:49.555
- Chicken wings?
- The food wasn't a bribe.

19:49.590 --> 19:51.957
I wanted to observe
his manner of eating.

19:51.993 --> 19:54.860
- Like an animal.
- Exactly.

19:54.896 --> 19:57.530
You know, I think he has
clinical lycanthropy,

19:57.565 --> 20:01.300
usually brought on by schizophrenia
or a psychotic break.

20:03.304 --> 20:05.204
Do I need a tattoo on my forehead

20:05.239 --> 20:07.673
that says "What does
that mean, Maura?"

20:07.708 --> 20:09.942
Oh. I assumed you were
just shocked into silence

20:09.977 --> 20:13.079
- because his condition is so rare.
- Nope!

20:13.114 --> 20:14.713
Less than 1% of the population

20:14.749 --> 20:17.249
suffers from split personality
schizophrenia,

20:17.285 --> 20:22.221
and less than 1% of that group
fits the criteria for this diagnosis.

20:22.256 --> 20:26.125
- Which is what?
- The word "lycanthrope" is derived

20:26.160 --> 20:27.893
from the Greek term
meaning "werewolf."

20:27.929 --> 20:30.963
The subject's doglike behavior
is due to his belief that ...

20:30.998 --> 20:32.698
Hold up.

20:32.733 --> 20:34.567
Okay, you were speaking
rather quickly there,

20:34.602 --> 20:37.837
but I'm fairly confident
you said the word "werewolf."

20:37.872 --> 20:39.972
- I did.
- He does not!

20:40.007 --> 20:43.576
- He might.
- This is my shocked face!

20:43.611 --> 20:45.978
Oh, it looks like your
"I smell pickles" face.

20:46.013 --> 20:47.713
Why would I make this face
when I smell pickles?

20:47.748 --> 20:49.115
I love pickles ... okay!

20:49.150 --> 20:51.016
What you're telling me

20:51.052 --> 20:54.053
is that McGruff thinks
he can turn into a wolf.

20:54.088 --> 20:57.056
- Teeth, claws, the whole business?
- That's correct.

20:57.091 --> 20:59.909
When his condition is activated,
he experiences delusions

20:59.910 --> 21:02.728
and hallucinations that make
him believe he is an animal.

21:02.763 --> 21:06.532
In this case, a subspecies of
genus Canis called Canis Lupus.

21:08.236 --> 21:11.570
Okay, well, he said that
he was hurt by a hunter,

21:11.606 --> 21:14.974
which is most likely our sniper.
That makes him an eyewitness.

21:16.244 --> 21:20.987
- Who thinks he's a wolf.
- Nobody's perfect.

21:27.610 --> 21:29.607
McGruff is the only lead we've got.

21:29.642 --> 21:31.799
There must be a way to get
a coherent statement out of him.

21:31.919 --> 21:35.079
Possibly after several weeks
of intensive treatment.

21:35.115 --> 21:37.618
Okay, well, we don't have time
for that.

21:37.738 --> 21:39.902
He's not a ...
He's not a patient yet, right?

21:40.022 --> 21:42.387
Technically, no, until I call
forensic mental health services.

21:42.422 --> 21:44.088
Hold on. Patient?

21:44.124 --> 21:46.591
Are you guys buying into
this kid's wolverine act?

21:46.626 --> 21:48.659
- Come on.
- I don't think he's faking.

21:48.695 --> 21:51.362
He's been living in
a urine-soaked den in the park

21:51.398 --> 21:53.498
- for at least two weeks.
- He told you that?

21:53.533 --> 21:56.100
Or did he bark his way through
a game of charades?

21:56.136 --> 21:58.936
I checked the records.
Calls about a growling man

21:58.972 --> 22:01.939
Stealing people's food in the park
started a few weeks ago.

22:01.975 --> 22:05.176
Yeah. The smell alone...

22:05.211 --> 22:09.147
It's a very long, smelly con.
It seems unlikely.

22:09.182 --> 22:11.015
All right.

22:11.050 --> 22:14.552
So the only person who can I.D.
Our sniper bays at the moon.

22:14.587 --> 22:17.455
Terrific.
How's that gonna hold up?

22:17.490 --> 22:19.424
How do we keep this kid
out of the psych ward?

22:19.459 --> 22:21.926
We need to avoid
aggravating his condition.

22:21.961 --> 22:23.628
So we keep him calm,
he doesn't wolf-out.

22:23.663 --> 22:25.930
Give him as many cheeseburgers
as he wants.

22:25.965 --> 22:29.307
- And that should buy us some time.
- Let's hope it's enough.

22:36.743 --> 22:40.445
Turns out custom reloaders are
very cooperative people...

22:40.480 --> 22:42.247
After I threatened them
with a warrant

22:42.282 --> 22:44.282
to seize all their chemicals
to search for unregistered tags.

22:44.317 --> 22:49.721
Nice work.
These people all buy custom gunpowder?

22:49.756 --> 22:52.290
These are members of clubs where
our shooter's gunpowder is sold.

22:52.325 --> 22:53.992
Don't they keep transaction records?

22:54.027 --> 22:55.893
They do for bullets but not gunpowder.

22:55.929 --> 22:58.763
It's gonna take us days to
run full checks on every one of 'em.

22:58.798 --> 23:00.265
We don't have that kind of time.

23:00.300 --> 23:02.200
Pull driver's license photos
on all these people.

23:02.235 --> 23:05.003
Maybe the wolf kid can pick one
out of the pack.

23:05.038 --> 23:07.138
You said "pack."

23:13.446 --> 23:17.024
- You get it, right?
- I'm laughing on the inside.

23:28.173 --> 23:31.696
Oh, hi. I didn't know
you were gonna stop by.

23:31.731 --> 23:34.258
I feel like I handed you a pile of...

23:34.378 --> 23:37.284
Anxiety and indecision
and just walked away.

23:37.404 --> 23:39.237
- Not cool.
- Well...

23:39.272 --> 23:42.240
- It's a lot to process.
- I've done some thinking.

23:42.275 --> 23:45.243
I think I've got an option
that might work.

23:45.278 --> 23:46.911
And now that I have
some actual details,

23:46.946 --> 23:48.279
I thought it'd be appropriate
to share with you

23:48.315 --> 23:50.715
so we can work through it together.

23:50.750 --> 23:52.417
Why are you looking at me
like that?

23:52.452 --> 23:54.385
I love when you say mature things.

23:54.421 --> 23:58.256
- Well, I am a grown man.
- You are, and that's very rare.

23:58.291 --> 24:00.792
And incredibly disappointing
to my gender as a whole.

24:00.827 --> 24:02.927
I'm gonna have to bring that up
at our next meeting.

24:02.962 --> 24:07.065
- So you said you figured out a plan.
- Yes. I talked to N.M.U.,

24:07.100 --> 24:08.933
and they have an opening
for a full-time professor.

24:08.968 --> 24:11.718
That's great.
It isn't?

24:11.838 --> 24:14.105
That would mean relocating full-time.

24:14.140 --> 24:17.208
But they also have room
for an adjunct professor,

24:17.243 --> 24:20.775
which would allow me to live
and work part-time in Boston.

24:21.781 --> 24:25.216
But then you'd be walking away
going to a tenure track job

24:25.251 --> 24:27.785
and you would only be
seeing Allie part of the year.

24:27.820 --> 24:29.353
If we're gonna make this work,

24:29.388 --> 24:31.255
we're all gonna have to make sacrifices.

24:32.859 --> 24:35.426
Do you disagree?

24:37.622 --> 24:41.565
All I know is I...
I don't wanna lose you.

24:45.171 --> 24:48.730
Sorry.
It's Jane.

24:48.850 --> 24:50.574
- I have to get back to this case.
- Of course.

24:50.610 --> 24:52.510
But I don't wanna
leave things like this.

24:52.545 --> 24:56.113
Maura, if we both want the same
thing, it's gonna work out fine.

24:56.149 --> 24:58.315
We'll solve this together.

24:58.351 --> 24:59.850
Right. Together.

24:59.886 --> 25:01.685
Wait. Sorry.

25:02.873 --> 25:04.118
Bye.

25:09.095 --> 25:10.761
I gotta call you back.

25:10.797 --> 25:14.298
Uniform searching in Franklin Park
just found a third sniper's nest.

25:14.334 --> 25:15.766
Same as the first two?

25:15.802 --> 25:17.301
Pegs in the trunk,
perch in the branches.

25:17.337 --> 25:18.903
Well, let's go.

25:18.938 --> 25:21.038
There's gotta be a connection
between these nests.

25:21.074 --> 25:23.074
If we find his pattern,
we'll find the guy.

25:29.967 --> 25:32.050
Hey. Did you get my text?

25:32.170 --> 25:34.518
- You said you were coming down.
- Yeah, and then I said,

25:34.638 --> 25:37.203
"scratch that I need you to
come upstairs and talk to teen wolf."

25:37.323 --> 25:39.121
Um...
Well, after that,

25:39.241 --> 25:41.430
it's just variations
of "where the hell are you?"

25:41.550 --> 25:45.166
These emoticons don't deserve to
be used in such disturbing ways.

25:45.286 --> 25:47.898
Gets the point across, doesn't it?

25:47.934 --> 25:50.334
- How is he?
- He's sleeping.

25:50.370 --> 25:52.303
But we just found
a third sniper's nest,

25:52.338 --> 25:53.638
and he's the only witness we have,

25:53.673 --> 25:55.239
so we gotta get in there
and talk to him.

25:55.274 --> 25:57.041
Well, I know, but the subject
of the hunter

25:57.076 --> 25:58.976
triggers his fear response,
and you saw what happened.

25:59.012 --> 26:01.445
Yeah. Kaboom.
Wolf-nado.

26:01.481 --> 26:03.747
Somehow that's exactly right.

26:03.867 --> 26:05.583
All right, so how'd you
get him to talk?

26:05.618 --> 26:08.185
- Was it the cheeseburger?
- I think it was more my sympathy.

26:08.221 --> 26:09.854
- For his hand?
- Well, not just that,

26:09.889 --> 26:13.057
but also the suffering that he
endures because of his condition.

26:13.177 --> 26:16.637
You know, maybe if I indulge
his delusion and show compassion

26:16.638 --> 26:20.097
for his experience of being
a man who turns into a wolf,

26:20.132 --> 26:23.067
he might feel safe enough to
endure talking about the hunter

26:23.102 --> 26:25.135
and not trigger his fear response.

26:25.171 --> 26:28.105
Great! Do that upstairs.

26:37.951 --> 26:40.918
All the nests are
within 300 yards of streets.

26:40.954 --> 26:44.055
Two commercial, one residential.
No pattern there.

26:44.090 --> 26:47.256
The other two were in busy areas.
This one has less foot traffic.

26:47.376 --> 26:50.470
Looks like the nest locations
are just as random as the victims.

26:50.590 --> 26:53.097
<i>- There's gotta be ...
- Here's a photo from the nest.</i>

26:53.132 --> 26:55.132
Thank you.

26:55.168 --> 26:57.501
Bring up the pictures
of the second nest.

26:57.537 --> 26:59.870
- Yeah. Mm-hmm.
- The one where he shot Fritz.

27:03.542 --> 27:06.176
There's only one streamer
in the second nest.

27:06.212 --> 27:09.046
Maybe he only had time to hang
one, or the others fell off.

27:09.082 --> 27:10.781
No, this guy plans everything
to a tee.

27:10.817 --> 27:12.817
If he wanted to use
three streamers, he would have.

27:12.852 --> 27:14.352
What's the difference
between one and three?

27:14.387 --> 27:16.187
With three streamers,
the shooter picks his target,

27:16.222 --> 27:19.290
checks the closest streamer
for wind factor, makes the shot.

27:19.325 --> 27:21.058
For one streamer to be useful,

27:21.094 --> 27:23.327
he's gotta know the exact
location of his target.

27:23.363 --> 27:27.031
The sniper knew when Jeremy
Fritz would be at that exact spot.

27:27.066 --> 27:29.066
All the other shootings
were just to throw us off.

27:29.102 --> 27:31.402
Fritz was the sniper's
primary target.

27:48.464 --> 27:51.966
If you'll let me, I'd like to
take a look at your hand.

27:53.102 --> 27:55.185
I can help it feel better.

27:55.305 --> 27:59.440
May I take a look at your hand?

28:13.990 --> 28:16.891
It's sprained very badly.

28:16.926 --> 28:18.526
Here.

28:20.330 --> 28:25.099
This will help it heal faster
and it won't hurt all the time.

28:25.134 --> 28:27.468
<i>Okay?</i>

28:30.039 --> 28:33.140
<i>Must be hard to live in the park.</i>

28:35.612 --> 28:37.311
Hungry.

28:40.283 --> 28:43.241
Is that how you...
you met the hunter?

28:43.361 --> 28:45.104
You were looking for food?

28:47.624 --> 28:50.858
He came at night

28:50.893 --> 28:53.094
to make the trees.

28:56.099 --> 28:59.166
Did you ever see him in the daylight?

29:03.373 --> 29:05.940
He had a gun.

29:05.975 --> 29:09.877
Did you ... did you see him
with a gun just one time?

29:15.251 --> 29:17.342
You saw him with a gun twice?

29:20.590 --> 29:22.156
And the second time you saw him,

29:22.191 --> 29:24.966
you knew what he was
going to do, didn't you?

29:25.086 --> 29:28.095
Tried to...

29:28.131 --> 29:31.232
stop him in the tree.

29:31.267 --> 29:33.100
You climbed up in the tree
after the hunter?

29:33.136 --> 29:35.436
That's ... that's really brave.

29:35.471 --> 29:39.440
He pushed me out.
He hit me more.

29:39.475 --> 29:42.109
You can help us stop him for good.
Do you wanna do that?

29:42.145 --> 29:45.012
I know you've been hurt,

29:45.048 --> 29:49.850
but you're safe with me.
Okay?

29:49.886 --> 29:53.451
I'm not afraid of you.
I know that you wanna help.

29:59.362 --> 30:03.230
Now tell me what else
you remember about the hunter.

30:07.437 --> 30:09.303
He loud.

30:11.174 --> 30:13.145
Copper.

30:15.078 --> 30:17.311
Wet.

30:22.618 --> 30:25.553
Okay. Thanks.

30:25.588 --> 30:28.022
Jeremy Fritz is out of surgery,
but he's in recovery.

30:28.057 --> 30:30.591
The doctor still won't give us
the okay to talk to him.

30:30.626 --> 30:32.560
All right. What about
his routine? What do we know?

30:32.595 --> 30:35.563
He goes to work every day
at the same time.

30:35.598 --> 30:37.298
On Tuesdays,

30:37.333 --> 30:40.101
he goes to physical therapy
during his lunch hour.

30:40.136 --> 30:42.103
Where is that?

30:42.138 --> 30:43.904
Here.
Two blocks North of the park.

30:43.940 --> 30:47.942
- And walking distance from his office.
- So once a week at lunch,

30:47.977 --> 30:50.377
Jeremy Fritz stands on
the same street corner.

30:50.413 --> 30:52.346
It was the perfect plan,
but he missed.

30:52.381 --> 30:55.316
Wolf kid said he got
into the tree with the hunter.

30:55.351 --> 30:57.485
Words he used to describe
the guy were "copper" and "wet."

30:57.520 --> 31:01.155
- What if he was describing blood?
- You think he bit the sniper?

31:01.190 --> 31:03.157
Could've. Thrown the shot off,
saved Jeremy's life.

31:03.192 --> 31:05.577
Drivers' license photos
of people who had access

31:05.578 --> 31:08.462
to the tagged gunpowder and
also live or work near the park.

31:08.498 --> 31:10.331
Get these to Jane and have her
run 'em by the kid.

31:10.366 --> 31:11.932
Maybe it'll spark something.

31:11.968 --> 31:13.901
Let's hope he bites
with his eyes open.

31:21.377 --> 31:22.943
Psst!

31:25.515 --> 31:27.281
I got your text.
He needs a C.A.T. scan?

31:27.316 --> 31:29.049
I think his condition
could be the result

31:29.085 --> 31:30.885
of a tumor on his hypothalamus,

31:30.920 --> 31:33.888
which is part of the brain that
detects changes in the body.

31:33.923 --> 31:36.502
It's potentially life-threatening.
I had to bring him in.

31:36.622 --> 31:39.744
And we were hoping
he'd get a look at these photos.

31:39.864 --> 31:41.753
Well, he's just sedated for the test.

31:41.873 --> 31:43.164
I'm sure
if you come back later,

31:43.199 --> 31:44.431
he'll be alert enough
to go through them.

31:44.467 --> 31:45.933
I'm sorry, Jane.
I really had no choice.

31:45.968 --> 31:47.654
Mm, no.
Of course. Of course.

31:48.938 --> 31:52.039
- What's this?
- Well, the sniper doesn't know

31:52.074 --> 31:54.859
that he isn't a reliable witness.
As far as he knows,

31:54.860 --> 31:57.344
this is the only person
who can tie him to the shootings.

31:57.380 --> 32:00.948
- Which makes him a target.
- Yes, it does.

32:00.983 --> 32:02.583
Stay with him no matter what.

32:03.920 --> 32:07.321
- Thanks, Jane.
- Mm-hmm.

32:07.356 --> 32:12.026
<i>Dr. Reddick, radiology.
Dr. Reddick, radiology.</i>

32:17.466 --> 32:19.500
Yeah. Thanks.

32:21.070 --> 32:22.603
Jeremy Fritz picked out
three of the people

32:22.638 --> 32:24.471
from the driver's license photos,

32:24.507 --> 32:27.617
- but they all have alibis.
- Any of them have connections

32:27.737 --> 32:29.240
- to Fritz or his family?
- Nope.

32:29.360 --> 32:31.579
And I think the painkillers
aren't helping much.

32:31.614 --> 32:35.316
Well, maybe a doped up victim is
less helpful than the wolf kid.

32:35.351 --> 32:37.017
If Maura can turn him into
a reliable witness,

32:37.053 --> 32:38.919
he might be all we need.

32:44.319 --> 32:45.626
It's called a C.A.T. scan.

32:45.746 --> 32:47.686
They're gonna take a picture
of your insides.

32:47.806 --> 32:50.568
- Does it hurt?
- Not at all. It looks like a doughnut,

32:50.688 --> 32:53.033
and you're gonna go through
the doughnut hole on the table.

32:53.069 --> 32:56.070
Mm. You come, too.

32:56.105 --> 32:58.939
You'll hear my voice the entire time.

32:58.975 --> 33:03.244
Hey, it's okay.
You're all right. You're all right.

33:03.279 --> 33:05.846
No, no. Stop.
He's not trying to hurt me.

33:05.882 --> 33:07.583
- What is scaring you?
- What are you ...

33:07.703 --> 33:09.984
You, run!
Run!

33:13.289 --> 33:15.356
Okay, get him into a room
and lock the door!

33:17.626 --> 33:21.062
Jane, I think the sniper tracked
us to the hospital. He's here.

33:21.182 --> 33:24.380
<i>All right, I'll turn around.
I'll be there in five.</i>

33:24.500 --> 33:25.732
<i>Hey!</i>

33:31.765 --> 33:34.165
Maura, I'm here.
Tell me exactly where you are.

33:34.201 --> 33:36.868
<i>East atrium, fifth floor.
I think he's going down.</i>

33:36.903 --> 33:38.903
Okay, Frankie's on his way
with backup.

33:38.939 --> 33:40.472
What does this guy look like?

33:40.507 --> 33:42.474
<i>Tall, dark hair,
jeans, a-and jacket.</i>

33:42.509 --> 33:43.875
Be right there.

33:50.217 --> 33:52.350
<i>- Excuse me.
- Oh!</i>

34:34.860 --> 34:37.395
Don't... You... Move.

34:41.567 --> 34:43.300
You all right?

34:43.335 --> 34:45.069
He's got a laceration

34:45.103 --> 34:46.904
in his right quadricep.

34:48.107 --> 34:50.174
And you're holding a scalpel.

34:54.347 --> 34:57.182
Remind me
not to piss you off.

35:09.830 --> 35:12.730
Piedmont Westley junior.

35:12.766 --> 35:14.299
Prints brought up
a lot of arrests,

35:14.334 --> 35:15.733
but not too many charges.

35:15.769 --> 35:18.570
- His family politically connected?
- Just rich.

35:18.605 --> 35:20.405
Westley's father always got him
out of trouble,

35:20.440 --> 35:23.408
everything from plagiarism
to arson.

35:23.443 --> 35:24.909
Great parenting.

35:24.945 --> 35:26.711
Now his kid's graduated to
murder and attempted murder.

35:26.746 --> 35:28.479
Why did he target
Jeremy Fritz?

35:28.515 --> 35:31.583
Uh, daddy's latest move
was to get Westley Jr. a job

35:31.618 --> 35:33.718
at Fritz's investment firm.

35:33.753 --> 35:35.420
Piedmont worked for Fritz?

35:35.455 --> 35:37.322
For about five minutes.
Fritz fired him a month ago.

35:37.357 --> 35:38.623
He didn't think
he should mention

35:38.658 --> 35:40.291
a disgruntled ex-employee?

35:40.327 --> 35:41.726
Maybe Fritz didn't realize
he was disgruntled.

35:41.761 --> 35:44.696
He also didn't know
that this job

35:44.731 --> 35:46.331
was Westley's last chance.

35:46.366 --> 35:48.833
Or what? Daddy takes
his allowance away?

35:48.869 --> 35:51.636
This guy never worked
for anything his whole life...

35:51.671 --> 35:55.440
Except for one notable skill.

35:55.475 --> 35:57.308
Marksmanship.

35:57.344 --> 35:58.576
He was the captain
of the rifle club

35:58.612 --> 35:59.844
at his prep school.

35:59.880 --> 36:01.346
He was gonna kill his boss

36:01.381 --> 36:03.181
along with a couple of
innocent people

36:03.216 --> 36:05.116
just to make us thin.

36:05.151 --> 36:06.851
If I've said it once,
I've said it a hundred times ...

36:06.887 --> 36:12.156
Sociopaths always underestimate
the resilience of the werewolf.

36:29.776 --> 36:31.142
Hey.

36:33.046 --> 36:34.979
A benign tumor
near your brain stem

36:35.014 --> 36:37.081
is causing your condition.

36:37.116 --> 36:39.850
But once the doctors
remove it...

36:39.886 --> 36:41.619
No more wolf.

36:41.654 --> 36:43.754
No more wolf.

36:46.993 --> 36:48.959
Smart doctor.

36:48.995 --> 36:51.562
Maura.

36:51.597 --> 36:52.863
There are a lot of
other smart people

36:52.899 --> 36:55.232
working really hard
to help you.

36:55.268 --> 36:57.702
They found
a missing persons report

36:57.737 --> 36:59.704
that matched
your description.

36:59.739 --> 37:02.306
But it took a while because you
went missing in New Hampshire,

37:02.342 --> 37:04.141
and your family is from Hartford.

37:06.594 --> 37:08.646
Your name is Michael Lyons.

37:08.681 --> 37:14.585
- You're a student at U.N.H.
- Michael...

37:14.620 --> 37:17.988
You were taking the bus home
and you got kicked off in Boston.

37:18.024 --> 37:22.593
We've contacted your family,
and they're on their way.

37:28.768 --> 37:33.030
Thank you, Maura.

37:51.026 --> 37:52.452
Maura.

37:55.728 --> 37:58.729
- How are you?
- Good.

38:00.733 --> 38:03.167
I feel like I know
what you're gonna say,

38:03.202 --> 38:06.170
and it starts with
"I've been thinking."

38:06.205 --> 38:07.638
I have.

38:07.673 --> 38:09.507
Uh-huh.

38:09.542 --> 38:11.575
About human cell division.

38:12.945 --> 38:15.246
Okay, strike that. I have
no idea what you're gonna say.

38:15.281 --> 38:17.181
It's really very fascinating.

38:17.216 --> 38:18.783
Okay. Go on.

38:18.818 --> 38:24.822
Well, the way the chromosomes
just line up just so.

38:24.857 --> 38:27.258
And then,
when the time's right,

38:27.293 --> 38:31.529
they're pulled apart
by a force beyond their control.

38:31.564 --> 38:32.930
And then they go on

38:32.965 --> 38:35.733
to thrive as new,
entirely separate entities.

38:35.768 --> 38:38.002
How reassuring.

38:38.037 --> 38:40.070
Did you know that
these newly divided cells

38:40.106 --> 38:41.672
are actually called daughter cells?

38:41.707 --> 38:42.973
Separation is inevitable.

38:43.009 --> 38:45.676
Is that what you're trying
to tell me?

38:45.711 --> 38:47.611
Not for you and Allie.

38:49.982 --> 38:55.586
You can't be so far away
from her, not even part-time.

38:55.621 --> 38:58.889
These years are so precious,
and I can't ask you to miss

38:58.925 --> 39:01.258
not one moment
of your daughter's life.

39:01.294 --> 39:03.093
That would be my decision.

39:03.129 --> 39:05.229
The burden of knowing

39:05.264 --> 39:09.767
that I was the reason that you
weren't there for her...

39:09.802 --> 39:11.261
It would kill me.

39:12.972 --> 39:16.207
And eventually, that would...
That would kill us.

39:16.242 --> 39:19.043
So the net effect is the same
whether I stay or go.

39:19.078 --> 39:21.612
Not for Allie.

39:26.085 --> 39:28.252
So...

39:28.287 --> 39:30.154
This is good-bye.

39:35.728 --> 39:37.895
I'm glad you said it,
because I can't.

39:51.244 --> 39:53.711
- So he'll make a full recovery.
- No more wolf.

39:53.746 --> 39:55.279
If you ask me,

39:55.314 --> 39:57.948
that wolf situation
was a lucky break.

39:57.984 --> 40:00.017
You wanna field this one?

40:01.754 --> 40:03.554
Uh, well, it is true that,

40:03.589 --> 40:06.223
if Michael hadn't been living
like an animal in the park,

40:06.259 --> 40:08.692
he wouldn't have been there
to witness the shooting.

40:08.728 --> 40:11.095
The sniper would've killed
at least three people,

40:11.130 --> 40:14.832
and he would've walked,
like that guy in the movie.

40:14.867 --> 40:16.200
Here we go.

40:16.235 --> 40:19.970
That guy with the limp?
Come on, you know.

40:20.006 --> 40:22.573
- Kaiser Soze?
- Yes!

40:22.608 --> 40:24.575
<i>Thank you! Thank you!</i>

40:24.610 --> 40:28.178
Okay, you two,
don't stay out too late.

40:28.214 --> 40:30.316
And, Jane, you know when you're
tired, you get that...

40:30.436 --> 40:31.522
- Twitch?
- Yeah.

40:31.642 --> 40:32.750
- Thanks, Ma.
- Love you.

40:32.785 --> 40:34.618
Love you, too.

40:35.821 --> 40:37.254
You okay?

40:40.192 --> 40:43.861
Allie's relationship with her
father is more important than mine.

40:43.896 --> 40:47.631
And is that making us feel better now?

40:47.667 --> 40:48.933
Not at the moment, no.

40:50.703 --> 40:54.171
Look, Maura....

40:54.206 --> 40:56.173
you were given that plaque

40:56.208 --> 41:00.077
because you put others
before yourself. Okay?

41:00.112 --> 41:02.746
And, yes, I'm sure
at the pearly gates,

41:02.782 --> 41:05.849
virtue will be rewarded. But...

41:05.885 --> 41:08.152
right now, virtue kinda sucks.

41:10.805 --> 41:14.119
- Beeing a grown-up sucks.
- I'll drink to that.

41:15.479 --> 41:18.541
All right.

41:19.195 --> 41:21.637
- Mmm! Yes!
- Oh!

41:22.950 --> 41:25.150
And ... no, wait, 'cause ...
Well, it's on Ma!

41:25.270 --> 41:28.526
And Korsak.
All right.

41:30.108 --> 41:33.473
<i>- Here's to ... being an adult.
- Mnh. </i>

41:33.593 --> 41:36.487
<i>- It sucks.
- Yes, is does.</i>
