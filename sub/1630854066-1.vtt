00:13.833 --> 00:15.583
NETFLIX PRESENTS

00:38.916 --> 00:40.791
INSPIRED BY REAL EVENTS

02:54.250 --> 02:55.666
<i>Lophiiformes.</i>

02:56.375 --> 02:57.541
Anglerfish.

03:00.000 --> 03:02.166
Bluntnose sixgill sharks.

03:03.375 --> 03:05.333
<i>Macropinna microstoma.</i>

03:06.000 --> 03:07.125
Barreleyes<i>.</i>

03:08.333 --> 03:11.083
The giant squid, <i>Architeuthis dux.</i>

03:11.875 --> 03:14.666
All these creatures
are capable of surviving

03:14.750 --> 03:17.750
in depths extending
far beyond the epipelagic zone

03:17.833 --> 03:19.083
and any sunlight.

03:19.166 --> 03:22.708
So how can these creatures
adapt to such depths?

03:23.208 --> 03:25.750
They are survivors of the sea.

03:26.250 --> 03:30.083
There is a microlayer on the surface of
the ocean that moves between sea and sky.

03:30.166 --> 03:31.583
DIVISIONS OF OCEANIC ENVIRONMENT

03:31.666 --> 03:34.416
It is simultaneously both and neither.

03:35.000 --> 03:40.000
Every known life form exists
in relation to this microlayer.

03:40.083 --> 03:43.333
Above it,
the world of land, air, sunlight.

03:43.833 --> 03:46.166
Below it, the world of water,

03:46.250 --> 03:48.458
the world of depth, and pressure.

03:49.458 --> 03:53.416
The deeper that you go,
the darker it gets, the more hostile.

03:53.500 --> 03:57.500
At around 30 meters, the alveoli
in your lungs start to contract,

03:57.583 --> 04:01.625
leaving you with only a portion
of the air you inhaled at the surface.

04:01.708 --> 04:06.708
The massive amount of water pressure
bearing down on you would be excruciating.

04:06.791 --> 04:10.791
And should you go deeper,
your lungs would cease to function,

04:10.875 --> 04:12.500
killing you on the spot.

04:13.041 --> 04:15.125
Have a good week, everyone.

04:31.500 --> 04:34.583
CONFERENCE
FREEDIVING CLASS

04:34.666 --> 04:39.875
BY THE 2015 WORLD CHAMPION
PASCAL GAUTIER

05:01.416 --> 05:02.875
Is that you, sweetie?

05:04.166 --> 05:05.125
Yeah.

05:05.208 --> 05:07.875
You know, you could sit while you eat.

05:12.041 --> 05:13.666
You stopped going.

05:13.750 --> 05:16.291
-You're not going anymore?
-Well, I don't need her.

05:16.375 --> 05:18.791
According to who? According to you or her?

05:18.875 --> 05:21.583
Mom, don't. I don't wanna talk about it.

05:21.666 --> 05:22.666
You never want to.

05:22.750 --> 05:25.875
-We need to discuss it. It's important.
-Well, later. I have schoolwork.

05:25.958 --> 05:28.375
-Maybe later.
-Later, it's always later! Tell me when!

05:28.958 --> 05:30.708
Seriously.

06:01.291 --> 06:03.208
MOM
I WON'T BE THERE THIS WEEKEND

06:03.291 --> 06:04.791
I'M STAYING WITH A FRIEND
LOVE YOU

06:17.833 --> 06:19.500
Excuse me! Wake up.

06:21.208 --> 06:23.125
Come on, get up. Let's go!

06:23.208 --> 06:26.041
You can't sleep on the beach.
This isn't some hotel.

06:27.208 --> 06:30.041
There's a youth hostel nearby.
This isn't actually a bed.

06:38.583 --> 06:40.625
-You speak English?
-Uh, yes.

06:40.708 --> 06:43.208
I'm here for the diving class with Pascal.

06:45.625 --> 06:48.791
We get a bunch of kids sleeping
on the beach, so I thought that…

06:49.708 --> 06:51.333
Was the youth hostel full, then?

06:51.416 --> 06:54.291
I'm not sure.
I spent all my money on the course.

06:55.083 --> 06:56.166
I'm glad.

06:57.041 --> 07:00.041
Sorry, I'm Tom, one of the instructors.

07:00.125 --> 07:01.416
You want a coffee?

07:02.416 --> 07:03.541
Yeah, okay.

07:05.875 --> 07:09.083
PORQUEROLLES, MAY 2016

07:11.166 --> 07:14.500
Freediving isn't about how long
you can stay underwater without breathing

07:14.583 --> 07:16.708
or how deep you can go
while holding your breath.

07:16.791 --> 07:19.375
It's about the experience down there.

07:19.958 --> 07:20.833
The peace.

07:21.416 --> 07:22.791
The tranquility.

07:22.875 --> 07:24.958
In fact, most of my course is focused on

07:25.041 --> 07:28.375
how to be in the best state of mind
before you dive.

07:28.458 --> 07:31.041
You need to be at peace
in order to know the limits of your body.

07:31.125 --> 07:32.958
There are three golden rules.

07:34.500 --> 07:35.625
Number one…

07:36.125 --> 07:37.333
Anybody?

07:39.083 --> 07:40.875
Never dive by yourself, okay?

07:40.958 --> 07:45.000
You always gotta freedive with a partner,
with another safety diver. Yeah?

07:45.083 --> 07:49.833
Two. Don't try to dive down as deep
as possible because it's dangerous.

07:49.916 --> 07:51.541
And pointless. Okay?

07:52.125 --> 07:53.541
And the third one?

07:54.041 --> 07:55.875
Just stay calm, relaxed,

07:57.000 --> 07:57.916
zen.

07:59.500 --> 08:00.791
-All right.
-Well.

08:02.750 --> 08:05.000
Everyone take a deep breath with me.

08:07.875 --> 08:10.333
And let the breath go.

08:10.916 --> 08:13.750
And get rid of all of your frustrations,
all your anger.

08:13.833 --> 08:15.166
All your fears.

08:29.708 --> 08:32.750
Here he is, the maestro himself!

08:33.333 --> 08:35.291
World champion, world record holder,

08:35.375 --> 08:37.750
although he's not quite
as good-looking as I am.

08:37.833 --> 08:39.625
I give you Pascal Gautier!

08:42.416 --> 08:43.333
Hi, everyone.

08:44.625 --> 08:45.791
I'm glad you're here.

08:46.375 --> 08:49.000
A big part of what stands
between you and success

08:49.583 --> 08:50.666
is your fear.

08:51.250 --> 08:53.625
So you'll need to learn
how to handle this fear.

08:54.125 --> 08:55.000
To control it.

08:55.583 --> 08:58.291
This is what will enable you
to go beyond your limits.

08:59.166 --> 09:01.458
And I promise you that after today,

09:02.166 --> 09:04.250
you're going to have a different feeling.

09:04.333 --> 09:06.041
A new connection with the ocean.

09:06.125 --> 09:09.333
A new strength and a new sensation,
a new power.

09:10.541 --> 09:13.625
And then,
you'll wanna sign up for the next level.

09:14.375 --> 09:15.541
I promise.

09:20.791 --> 09:23.041
All right, here we go,
everyone in the water.

09:42.500 --> 09:44.541
Nice work. You're doing well.

09:45.125 --> 09:49.041
You need to block your air around your
glottis and throat, not your lips, okay?

09:50.041 --> 09:52.666
Don't release any air. Not even a bit.

09:53.291 --> 09:56.041
Not until you're sure you're actually
going to breathe again.

09:56.125 --> 09:59.166
Each movement is a waste of energy.
So don't waste it.

10:14.500 --> 10:15.791
Stay calm.

10:15.875 --> 10:17.041
Trust your teachers.

10:17.625 --> 10:19.000
Trust your instincts.

10:26.958 --> 10:29.875
Everyone, listen up! Take a look
at how he's moving to go lower.

10:29.958 --> 10:31.416
Watch what he does!

10:58.750 --> 10:59.833
How far can he go?

11:00.833 --> 11:03.916
Pascal is special.
He can do 80, 100 meters, no problem.

11:04.000 --> 11:05.500
What makes him so special?

11:06.250 --> 11:08.916
It's mainly his ability to stay calm.

11:09.000 --> 11:12.666
It's what I said earlier. He's focused.
You need to stay calm down there.

11:12.750 --> 11:16.125
He's also developed
an extraordinary threshold for pain.

11:17.333 --> 11:19.750
The difference between
great divers and the rest

11:20.333 --> 11:23.750
is the ability to endure that pain.

11:24.375 --> 11:26.041
How long has he been down there for?

11:27.666 --> 11:28.541
Around two minutes.

11:42.500 --> 11:43.708
Thanks again.

11:43.791 --> 11:45.833
Keep it up,
be ready for a challenge, okay?

11:45.916 --> 11:47.416
-Did you have a good time?
-Yeah.

11:47.500 --> 11:49.791
-See you all tomorrow.
-Okay, see you tomorrow.

11:49.875 --> 11:51.333
-Hey, thanks.
-Hey.

11:51.416 --> 11:52.250
-See you.
-Thank you.

11:52.333 --> 11:54.958
-Do you know where you're staying?
-Uh, no, not yet.

11:55.041 --> 11:56.375
Not on a beach chair, I hope.

11:56.458 --> 11:58.833
Why not?
It's nice sleeping under the stars.

11:59.583 --> 12:01.750
Thank you for today. I learned a lot.

12:04.500 --> 12:06.541
-You had me fooled.
-With what?

12:06.625 --> 12:08.916
-You've dived before.
-Not really.

12:09.000 --> 12:12.000
I went spear fishing with my grandpa,
but that's different.

12:12.083 --> 12:13.833
Not really. It all started with that.

12:13.916 --> 12:16.041
You should stick with it. You're good.

12:17.958 --> 12:20.791
I'd like to.
But it's not really in my budget.

12:21.375 --> 12:23.458
Hey, Tom, where are you going?

12:23.541 --> 12:25.291
-I'm here!
-Well, come help us.

12:26.291 --> 12:28.666
All right.
Come meet me and the team tonight.

12:28.750 --> 12:30.250
I'll help you find a place to sleep.

12:30.333 --> 12:32.291
I'm friends with the guy
at the youth hostel.

12:32.375 --> 12:33.625
-Okay.
-Okay?

12:33.708 --> 12:35.041
I'll shoot you a message.

12:38.541 --> 12:39.458
Coming.

12:39.541 --> 12:41.458
-Seriously, we need your help.
-Okay, okay!

12:41.541 --> 12:42.541
-Hey!
-Come on!

12:42.625 --> 12:44.958
These guys get there
with six bottles of vodka.

12:45.041 --> 12:48.666
They were huge, big Russian guys,
like a Bolshevik reunion or something.

12:48.750 --> 12:50.541
-This little French guy with them.
-No way!

12:50.625 --> 12:53.208
He looked like Asterix,
with this creepy mustache, yeah?

12:53.291 --> 12:56.208
But yeah, anyway, they show up
with this Russian girl, and oh, man.

12:56.291 --> 12:58.833
Look, you girls are Champions League,
but, uh…

12:58.916 --> 13:00.625
she was World Cup, so…

13:00.708 --> 13:02.583
I love you guys.
So, we get the party started.

13:02.666 --> 13:04.625
Nothin' but shots, shots, shots.

13:04.708 --> 13:07.166
I down one, two, three.
This guy was holdin' his own, man.

13:07.250 --> 13:10.708
Holdin' up the table, the bar, the walls.
He was a beast!

13:10.791 --> 13:13.166
I knew we were done.
But shit, we drank so much.

13:13.250 --> 13:16.333
Bretons, Normans, whatever,
not one of them could keep up.

13:16.416 --> 13:17.583
But now…

13:20.083 --> 13:22.625
Well, now you gotta tell us
how it ends.

13:24.041 --> 13:24.916
-Hey.
-Hey.

13:26.541 --> 13:28.250
Uh, Roxana, everybody.

13:28.333 --> 13:30.083
-Everybody, Roxana.
-Hey.

13:30.583 --> 13:31.625
-Hi, everyone.
-Welcome.

13:31.708 --> 13:33.250
-Hi.
-How's it going?

13:33.333 --> 13:35.875
-Roxana, from class today.
-What? I know.

13:35.958 --> 13:37.958
He's lying, he doesn't know.

13:38.458 --> 13:41.125
Don't wink at me, all right?
I do remember.

13:41.208 --> 13:43.666
You've got a nerve, you bastard.

13:43.750 --> 13:46.166
Uh… Right, Well, then, anyway.

13:46.250 --> 13:48.083
So the guy shows up
with this Russian girl,

13:48.166 --> 13:50.166
and she's been looking at me
from the start.

13:50.250 --> 13:54.541
This one guy's watching me. We're losing,
but I am focused on the Russian girl.

13:54.625 --> 13:55.833
So did you beat them?

13:55.916 --> 13:58.250
These dudes started drinking vodka
when they were children.

13:58.333 --> 14:01.041
-What are you gonna do? I mean, no.
-You can't outdrink Russians.

14:01.125 --> 14:03.250
We all ended up in jail in Athens.

14:03.333 --> 14:05.458
It was a bit of Prison Greek!

14:05.541 --> 14:08.166
-Oh! Prison! Prison Greek, okay!
<i>-</i>Guys, guys, guys.

14:08.250 --> 14:10.708
This is the time for bad jokes, guys.
This is it.

14:10.791 --> 14:12.208
I love it when you're like this.

14:12.291 --> 14:14.125
<i>Na zdarovie</i> to all the Russians!

14:14.208 --> 14:16.708
-And Greeks! All right!
-<i>Na zdarovie </i>to the Greeks!

14:16.791 --> 14:20.500
-<i>Na zdarovie </i>to the Greeks!
-But it's true. It was insane!

14:20.583 --> 14:22.125
I bet.

15:58.125 --> 16:00.166
Of course that whore
put a curse on me!

16:00.250 --> 16:02.000
I told you she was meeting with shamans!

16:02.083 --> 16:04.291
She cursed me in Russian!

16:05.458 --> 16:06.791
Oh, man.

16:07.750 --> 16:10.875
I got the moves. My skin is tingling.
I just wanna go dance.

16:21.208 --> 16:22.416
Everything okay here?

16:29.166 --> 16:32.500
-You start the party already?
-Wanna join?

16:34.041 --> 16:35.208
Asshole!

16:35.291 --> 16:38.666
-What a fucking asshole. Unbelievable.
-But… Anna!

16:38.750 --> 16:40.666
Come back!

16:46.750 --> 16:48.291
Just can't help yourself.

16:49.500 --> 16:50.541
You were saying?

16:52.916 --> 16:53.875
Well, uh…

16:54.625 --> 16:55.666
Here's to love.

16:56.250 --> 16:57.500
And to sex.

16:57.583 --> 16:59.333
-Kevin, know Russia?
-Cheers.

16:59.416 --> 17:01.958
-Military secret.
-Military secret? Seriously!

17:02.041 --> 17:04.041
-Yeah!
-He won't talk about it!

17:38.250 --> 17:41.416
"From birth, man bears the weight
of gravity on his shoulders."

17:41.500 --> 17:43.291
"He is bolted to the Earth."

17:43.375 --> 17:45.833
"But man only has to sink
below the surface…"

17:46.333 --> 17:48.250
"And he is free."

17:49.500 --> 17:50.458
You like Cousteau?

17:51.250 --> 17:53.166
A lot. He's one of my mentors.

17:56.708 --> 17:57.666
Come on.

17:59.125 --> 18:00.791
Now show me what you've learned.

18:44.416 --> 18:46.500
You're not bad.

18:47.291 --> 18:48.791
What? For a girl?

18:49.375 --> 18:50.625
For a Parisian.

19:24.375 --> 19:25.666
Stéphane.

19:25.750 --> 19:28.083
Can you look after Roxy?
Show her a few things?

19:30.708 --> 19:31.583
Shit.

19:34.166 --> 19:37.083
-Don't let me get in your way.
-You're already here.

19:37.166 --> 19:39.791
If it were up to me,
I'd never let a rookie join us.

19:39.875 --> 19:42.000
But it's not my decision.

19:42.666 --> 19:44.666
Besides, it's always the same with him.

19:46.125 --> 19:47.333
Just watch and learn.

19:54.625 --> 19:58.291
-Did he tell you what he's doing today?
-Yeah. A practice dive, right?

19:58.375 --> 20:00.041
That asshole.

20:00.791 --> 20:02.041
Yeah, just practice.

20:02.541 --> 20:04.416
He's doing 172 meters.

20:04.916 --> 20:08.416
That's two meters deeper than
the current world record for no limit.

20:09.166 --> 20:10.166
Oh shit.

20:10.666 --> 20:12.250
No one's gone that deep before.

20:12.333 --> 20:13.791
Except in a submarine.

20:15.750 --> 20:16.791
Is it dangerous?

20:19.250 --> 20:22.458
All no limit dives are dangerous.
Especially for a new world record.

20:23.041 --> 20:25.125
-You know what no limit is?
-No.

20:25.208 --> 20:27.458
You're hooked to a sled
that takes you into the depths.

20:27.541 --> 20:30.583
To get back up, you inflate a lift bag,
it fills with air, and pshht.

20:30.666 --> 20:32.208
You come back to the surface.

20:32.291 --> 20:34.083
There are many other categories.

20:34.166 --> 20:36.750
CNF, CWF, static.

20:36.833 --> 20:37.791
Uh, CN what?

20:38.625 --> 20:39.916
CNF.

20:40.000 --> 20:42.125
Constant Weight No Fins.

20:42.208 --> 20:43.916
WF, With Fins.

20:44.000 --> 20:45.833
So it's with or without fins.

20:46.458 --> 20:48.833
-And he's using this?
-This is the sled.

20:48.916 --> 20:50.541
This thing takes him down.

20:51.250 --> 20:53.083
And this brings him back up.

20:53.166 --> 20:55.125
We'll check everything before he dives.

20:55.625 --> 20:57.625
The diving tank. The pony tank.

20:58.541 --> 21:00.208
The release. The lift bag.

21:00.833 --> 21:02.750
The lift cord and the pressure valve.

21:03.416 --> 21:05.875
We check everything
multiple times before a dive.

21:06.458 --> 21:09.666
And that… that guarantees
he gets back to the surface.

21:09.750 --> 21:11.458
There's no room for error.

21:11.541 --> 21:13.625
Unless he pisses us off, then…

21:14.250 --> 21:15.250
No, I'm kidding.

21:17.333 --> 21:18.791
Uh.

21:19.500 --> 21:20.708
The connection's fine.

21:20.791 --> 21:22.458
Everything's good. Perfect.

21:22.541 --> 21:24.041
Okay, so, uh…

21:24.125 --> 21:26.166
This takes the diver down,

21:26.250 --> 21:29.375
and then you wait for him down there
in case something happens?

21:30.000 --> 21:31.208
Yeah, more or less.

21:31.708 --> 21:34.708
There are divers every 40 meters.
That makes eight of us.

21:35.291 --> 21:36.541
And a medic.

21:37.125 --> 21:39.791
I'm at the bottom,
and after he comes back up, I wait.

21:39.875 --> 21:43.041
I have to decompress in stages for three
hours before I get back to the surface.

21:43.125 --> 21:47.208
All right. All right, 30 minutes
for the dive team. Thirty minutes!

21:47.291 --> 21:48.833
-Okay!
-Thirty minutes!

21:51.083 --> 21:53.250
And what if he passes out down there?

21:53.333 --> 21:56.500
All blackouts happen 20 meters
before the surface.

21:57.083 --> 22:00.666
He might get nitrogen narcosis.
It's like being drunk underwater.

22:00.750 --> 22:03.041
Some divers lose function
when they reach the bottom.

22:03.125 --> 22:04.958
So Pascal needs to do four things.

22:05.041 --> 22:06.916
Number one, he gives us an okay.

22:07.458 --> 22:09.041
Two, he grabs the lift bag.

22:09.125 --> 22:11.583
Three, he twists the valve,
releases the pin, and goes up.

22:11.666 --> 22:13.833
He's going through
18 pressure atmospheres. That's big.

22:13.916 --> 22:16.041
His lungs are the size of an orange
down there.

22:16.125 --> 22:20.041
And if there's a problem, I can't
give him any air. His lungs would explode.

22:20.916 --> 22:23.500
Safety meeting! Everyone, let's go!

22:23.583 --> 22:26.583
All divers, state your name
and depth position.

22:27.375 --> 22:29.041
Jacques, surface safety.

22:30.125 --> 22:32.750
Mathieu, deep safety diver, at 40 meters.

22:32.833 --> 22:35.041
Alain Calmette, emergency rescue.
Surface team.

22:35.125 --> 22:37.666
Loïc, safety Trimix diver, 172 meters.

22:37.750 --> 22:39.916
Thierry, deep diver, 40 meters.

22:40.000 --> 22:41.250
9:42!

22:50.125 --> 22:53.166
Tom, safety Trimix diver. 172 meters.

22:53.250 --> 22:55.500
-Three minutes to immersion.
-Three minutes!

23:46.958 --> 23:49.250
Okay!
Thirty seconds to dive.

24:12.625 --> 24:15.500
Five, four, three,

24:16.125 --> 24:18.583
two, one, go!

24:49.916 --> 24:51.208
110 meters.

24:53.958 --> 24:55.208
140 meters.

24:56.916 --> 24:58.500
172 meters.

25:06.583 --> 25:07.875
Here he comes!

25:21.666 --> 25:23.000
110 meters!

25:23.958 --> 25:25.458
100 meters!

25:34.541 --> 25:35.458
Here he is!

25:47.833 --> 25:49.291
-I'm okay.
-Yeah!

25:49.375 --> 25:50.333
-Whoo!
-Yeah! All right!

25:50.416 --> 25:52.166
Yeah!

25:52.250 --> 25:53.291
-All right!
-Yeah!

25:53.375 --> 25:54.333
-Yes!
-Whoo!

25:54.416 --> 25:55.625
-Yeah!
-Yeah!

25:55.708 --> 25:57.041
-All right! Let's go!
-Whoo!

25:59.458 --> 26:00.625
Mathieu?

26:00.708 --> 26:02.583
Shit, Mathieu? Mathieu!

26:02.666 --> 26:04.125
-Where's Mathieu?
-Hey!

26:05.333 --> 26:07.125
-Go!
-Go! Go! Go!

26:07.708 --> 26:08.583
Where is he?

26:09.583 --> 26:10.750
We have to go!

26:30.916 --> 26:32.125
I'm calling for help.

26:33.125 --> 26:34.541
Mayday, mayday!

26:34.625 --> 26:36.916
This is the Ketos.
We need emergency medical assistance.

26:37.000 --> 26:38.291
A diver hasn't come up.

26:38.375 --> 26:42.125
Our location is 40° 00' 02" North,
6° 13' 38" East.

26:42.208 --> 26:43.916
-Hurry, hurry, hurry!
-Watch his head.

26:44.000 --> 26:45.791
-Bring him up.
-Hold his head up. Mathieu!

26:46.500 --> 26:48.541
-Here we go.
-Careful. Help me lift him.

26:48.625 --> 26:50.291
-Let's get him up.
-Hold his head.

26:50.958 --> 26:51.833
Okay.

26:56.916 --> 26:59.541
-Squeeze my hand. Can you hear me?
-Harbor master, Ketos.

26:59.625 --> 27:02.541
We have an unconscious diver on board,
he's completely unresponsive.

27:02.625 --> 27:05.166
-We need emergency help!
-<i>Roger that, Ketos.</i>

27:05.250 --> 27:06.958
-Aren't you a first responder?
<i>-Sending help.</i>

27:07.541 --> 27:08.916
What happened?

27:09.875 --> 27:13.541
-Shit! He's in cardiogenic shock!
-I need to do something!

27:13.625 --> 27:16.416
-He's not breathing. There's no pulse.
-Damn it.

27:18.291 --> 27:19.375
Get him to a hospital!

27:19.458 --> 27:22.458
-Sacha! First aid, damn it!
-Okay, keep going.

27:22.541 --> 27:25.041
Where is the harbor master?

27:26.208 --> 27:29.375
-Thierry, did you see what happened?
-We gotta get him to shore.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.833
Here, toss me that, will you?

27:40.916 --> 27:42.041
Excuse me.

27:43.125 --> 27:45.083
Now, you were
on the boat, correct?

27:45.916 --> 27:47.125
Yes, I was.

27:50.291 --> 27:51.458
Okay, guys.

27:53.041 --> 27:55.875
Let's unload, and then we have to make
a statement at the police station.

27:55.958 --> 27:57.791
Yeah? And tell them what?

27:58.500 --> 28:01.125
That he shouldn't have been at 40 meters
because he was a rookie?

28:01.208 --> 28:02.791
Then why'd you say it was fine?

28:03.375 --> 28:04.500
So did you.

28:05.375 --> 28:07.375
-It was an accident.
-Exactly, it was an accident.

28:07.458 --> 28:09.333
A horrible accident.

28:10.291 --> 28:11.958
That we should have prevented.

28:12.041 --> 28:16.333
Everyone here knows the risks, okay?
And he wasn't just your friend.

28:21.875 --> 28:22.875
Stéph!

28:25.250 --> 28:26.541
I'm sorry, okay?

28:27.833 --> 28:31.000
It's the stress.
And I'm angry too. He was my friend.

28:32.458 --> 28:33.625
And a good diver.

28:34.666 --> 28:35.750
You hear me?

28:36.500 --> 28:37.916
A good diver.

28:38.541 --> 28:40.708
Don't worry, I'll say whatever you say.

29:26.166 --> 29:27.708
I'd like us to take a moment.

29:29.125 --> 29:30.666
We lost a friend yesterday.

29:31.250 --> 29:32.666
A member of our family.

29:34.000 --> 29:35.458
Mathieu loved this work.

29:35.958 --> 29:37.541
He was conscientious.

29:38.916 --> 29:40.125
Applied himself.

29:41.708 --> 29:43.833
And he was passionate,
just like all of us.

29:44.750 --> 29:47.375
Despite that, he knew the risks.
He accepted them.

29:49.250 --> 29:52.416
I don't wanna speak for him.
But he'd want us to continue.

29:54.708 --> 29:57.375
If you all agree,
I think we should go for the record.

29:58.875 --> 30:00.083
And we'll do it for Mathieu.

30:01.666 --> 30:03.916
But we need another safety diver
at 40 meters.

30:06.833 --> 30:09.208
Shit, okay. All right, I'll do it.

30:10.250 --> 30:11.291
Okay, great.

30:12.541 --> 30:13.541
Thanks, Jacques.

30:17.500 --> 30:18.708
We need a surface diver.

30:20.583 --> 30:21.416
Okay.

30:22.166 --> 30:23.375
Um…

30:24.583 --> 30:25.666
I can do it.

30:25.750 --> 30:27.000
Hey!

30:29.500 --> 30:30.666
Are you crazy?

30:31.250 --> 30:34.333
You did okay yesterday, but you don't
become a safety diver in two days.

30:35.000 --> 30:36.166
This is bullshit.

30:37.125 --> 30:39.083
I think she's more than capable.

30:40.583 --> 30:41.833
She's talented.

30:43.041 --> 30:44.291
And has great instincts.

30:46.083 --> 30:47.791
Pascal. Hey.

30:47.875 --> 30:50.208
Let's ask the rest of the team
what they think.

30:50.791 --> 30:52.375
Then we'll decide all together.

30:55.083 --> 30:57.000
Well, I also think she can do it.

30:57.083 --> 30:58.125
She's good.

30:59.125 --> 31:01.000
She's held longer than five minutes,
no problem.

31:01.083 --> 31:03.375
She shouldn't be in the water, regardless!

31:04.458 --> 31:05.333
Tom!

31:05.916 --> 31:07.166
She has a gift, Stéphane.

31:07.250 --> 31:08.500
Tom.

31:08.583 --> 31:11.125
She knows first aid.
And she won't be alone.

31:13.291 --> 31:15.083
No one else, huh?

31:22.291 --> 31:24.083
Go fuck yourselves, all of you.

31:26.166 --> 31:27.333
Stéphane's right.

31:27.416 --> 31:30.000
-This is too fast.
-We need someone, don't we?

31:30.541 --> 31:33.000
Do you think you could
learn the procedure quickly?

31:33.583 --> 31:35.083
If you teach me, I can.

31:36.291 --> 31:39.333
I've been diving since I was little.
I'm first aid certified.

31:40.916 --> 31:43.333
Okay. So, who's in favor?

31:55.375 --> 31:58.291
You should go back to school.
To your life.

31:59.916 --> 32:02.625
No, I was serious.
I want to be a part of the team.

32:02.708 --> 32:04.250
And be away from your family?

32:04.958 --> 32:05.916
And school?

32:09.708 --> 32:10.791
I've decided.

32:14.125 --> 32:15.583
You should go back to school.

32:17.916 --> 32:20.166
I said no, all right?

32:21.500 --> 32:22.416
Okay.

32:23.500 --> 32:25.208
So you stay for this competition.

32:27.375 --> 32:28.458
Then what?

32:32.166 --> 32:33.541
Well, that's up to you.

32:42.791 --> 32:44.541
See. He's losing his air.

32:44.625 --> 32:46.916
That means he fainted. Blackout.

32:47.000 --> 32:49.166
Vice grip. Cradle the back of the neck.

32:49.250 --> 32:51.125
Protect the airways. All right?

32:51.208 --> 32:53.208
Remove his mask. Try to wake him up.

32:53.291 --> 32:55.000
Breathe, breathe, Pascal, breathe.

32:55.083 --> 32:58.291
He's not responding.
Put your hand on his mouth. Mouth to nose.

32:59.208 --> 33:01.625
Blow hard.
Remove your hand each time. All right?

33:02.125 --> 33:04.458
And if he doesn't come to,
boat and oxygen.

33:08.750 --> 33:10.250
Vice grip, okay? Roxy!

33:18.208 --> 33:20.791
Pascal, breathe. Pascal, just breathe.

33:27.875 --> 33:30.125
Freediving is serious.
You know what I mean?

33:30.208 --> 33:33.541
That's why we implement all
of the rescuers, the gestures, and all.

33:33.625 --> 33:36.000
You need to know everything,
have everything under control,

33:36.083 --> 33:37.500
-You got that?
-Okay, yeah.

33:37.583 --> 33:38.958
-If you're cold, signal this.
-Mm.

33:39.041 --> 33:41.583
-If you're tired, signal "I'm done."
-Like this, you mean?

33:41.666 --> 33:43.791
This means, "It's over, end of the event."

33:44.541 --> 33:50.166
AIDA WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP
PORQUEROLLES AUGUST 2016

33:52.250 --> 33:55.291
<i>Pascal Gautier.</i>
<i>No limit world record attempt,</i>

33:56.000 --> 33:57.666
<i>172 meters.</i>

34:00.375 --> 34:02.166
<i>Two minutes to official top.</i>

34:20.166 --> 34:21.625
Thirty seconds to dive.

34:22.791 --> 34:23.916
Thirty seconds.

36:19.416 --> 36:20.458
Thirty seconds!

36:21.708 --> 36:24.166
Safety team three, let's go down!

36:59.083 --> 37:01.041
I'm okay. I'm okay!

37:01.750 --> 37:04.333
<i>Pascal Gautier, 172 meters!</i>

37:06.166 --> 37:07.625
Whoo!

37:07.708 --> 37:08.750
Amazing!

37:09.416 --> 37:11.875
<i>New world record: 172 meters!</i>

37:51.000 --> 37:52.583
No, I'm telling you, I'm fine.

37:53.625 --> 37:54.708
<i>You're lying.</i>

37:55.541 --> 37:56.458
<i>Where are you?</i>

37:57.916 --> 37:59.125
I met someone.

37:59.208 --> 38:00.416
<i>I see.</i>

38:00.500 --> 38:01.791
You met a man.

38:01.875 --> 38:04.208
-And so, uh?
<i>-No, Mom, it's…</i>

38:04.291 --> 38:07.000
<i>-It's serious.</i>
<i>-</i>What are you saying? Are you pregnant?

38:07.583 --> 38:08.833
No, I'm not pregnant.

38:11.833 --> 38:12.750
Um…

38:13.625 --> 38:15.875
But, uh… I'm not going back to school.

38:15.958 --> 38:17.458
<i>Not right now, anyway.</i>

38:21.083 --> 38:23.208
<i>And, um…</i>

38:23.791 --> 38:26.000
Who is this man? What's he do?

38:27.250 --> 38:28.916
Well, his name's Pascal Gautier.

38:29.541 --> 38:30.791
He's a freediver.

38:31.875 --> 38:34.250
<i>He's a world champion.</i>
<i>He runs a diving school.</i>

38:34.333 --> 38:35.833
<i>He travels all over for competitions.</i>

38:35.916 --> 38:37.000
And he wants…

38:38.291 --> 38:39.750
He wants me here with him.

38:42.333 --> 38:44.125
So, you're telling me
you're quitting college

38:44.208 --> 38:47.833
and abandoning all of your plans
for some guy you met five minutes ago?

38:48.416 --> 38:50.208
Mom, I knew
that you would react like this.

38:50.291 --> 38:52.000
Why can't you be happy for me for once?

38:52.083 --> 38:55.041
<i>This is what I want.</i>
<i>He is my plan. A life with him.</i>

38:55.125 --> 38:57.416
I want you to look out
for yourself, Roxana.

38:57.500 --> 38:59.250
And I want you to take care of yourself.

38:59.333 --> 39:02.166
Look Mom, I have to go.
People are waiting for me right now.

39:03.500 --> 39:04.458
<i>Wait--</i>

39:56.208 --> 39:58.500
-Know the capital of Australia?
-Yeah, Canberra.

39:58.583 --> 40:00.291
Aaah!

40:00.375 --> 40:01.958
-Shit!
-Do you know the capital…

40:02.041 --> 40:03.541
-What?
-Stéphane, play!

40:03.625 --> 40:06.541
-Stop acting all shy over there!
-Do you… So, do you know the capital of…

40:06.625 --> 40:08.500
Ouagadougou! Burkina Faso!

40:18.666 --> 40:20.750
Fuck you.

40:20.833 --> 40:22.250
Don't listen to these idiots.

40:23.416 --> 40:24.625
Damn it.

40:24.708 --> 40:26.500
Alexi Sobiesky set a new record.

40:26.583 --> 40:27.791
-Oh, fuck.
-No, no way.

40:27.875 --> 40:29.291
-He did.
-Let me see that.

40:31.000 --> 40:33.541
Oh yeah. 174 meters.

40:33.625 --> 40:34.833
Who did?

40:35.458 --> 40:36.333
Sobiesky.

40:39.958 --> 40:43.416
Look we'll go for it again, Pascal.
That's what records are made for.

40:45.916 --> 40:47.875
Russian guys mean Russian babes.

40:51.000 --> 40:52.041
They do.

40:52.125 --> 40:53.916
I love it. I love it!

41:02.041 --> 41:04.250
-Show off those looks. Come on.
-No.

41:04.750 --> 41:06.916
Show me what you got.
Show me what you got!

41:08.500 --> 41:11.125
-No, no, you didn't.
-Yes, I did. I'm telling you. It was fast.

41:11.208 --> 41:12.750
-Oh, yeah, okay.
-But I was a kid.

41:12.833 --> 41:13.750
No, you weren't.

41:15.708 --> 41:17.000
I'm on my way!

41:29.791 --> 41:31.958
PRACTICE 176 METERS
FRENCH RIVIERA SEPTEMBER 2016

41:32.041 --> 41:33.166
One minute!

41:38.958 --> 41:40.375
Let's go. Let's go!

41:42.750 --> 41:43.833
Camera ready!

41:45.000 --> 41:46.208
Ten seconds.

41:49.500 --> 41:50.500
Coming.

43:10.291 --> 43:11.208
-Pascal!
-I've got him.

43:11.291 --> 43:12.583
-Pascal, breathe!
-Pascal!

43:12.666 --> 43:14.333
-We've gotta get him in.
-Breathe!

43:14.416 --> 43:15.875
-Pascal, breathe!
-He's not breathing.

43:15.958 --> 43:17.583
-Come on, get him on the boat.
-That's it.

43:17.666 --> 43:19.541
-Breathe.
-Pascal! Pascal!

43:19.625 --> 43:20.625
-Watch his head.
-Let's go.

43:20.708 --> 43:22.666
-That's it, come on.
-Pascal, breathe!

43:42.791 --> 43:45.625
BIOCHEMISTRY, HEMATOLOGY,
PHARMACOLOGY AND TOXICOLOGY

43:51.291 --> 43:52.666
And when was the last time?

43:53.875 --> 43:55.000
The last time I what?

43:56.083 --> 43:57.166
That I passed out?

43:59.000 --> 44:00.416
Hasn't happened in years.

44:01.375 --> 44:03.000
It's Roxana, isn't it?

44:04.041 --> 44:06.083
Your boyfriend is playing with fire.

44:06.166 --> 44:09.041
If he continues to dive,
this will not end well.

44:09.125 --> 44:11.833
If you love him,
you need to convince him to stop.

44:12.625 --> 44:14.000
Well, I can't do that.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.291
It's his whole life.

44:17.208 --> 44:18.375
For now, it is.

44:19.791 --> 44:22.541
You need to understand.
These blackouts aren't harmless.

44:23.375 --> 44:24.791
I'm asking you to stop.

44:26.625 --> 44:28.500
You're taking too many risks now.

44:29.833 --> 44:31.125
It is what it is.

44:32.083 --> 44:33.333
It's my life.

44:35.083 --> 44:37.208
Maybe you should see a different doctor.

44:37.833 --> 44:41.833
He's doing his job. It's always the same.
I'll dive again when I feel like it.

44:43.250 --> 44:45.208
-But I thought of somethin' else.
-What?

44:49.083 --> 44:50.000
Go on.

44:52.250 --> 44:53.791
Come on, what?

44:55.708 --> 44:58.208
Just tell me!

44:58.708 --> 45:04.041
FIRST PRACTICE
PORQUEROLLES AUGUST 2016

45:05.333 --> 45:07.500
Clear mind. Clear dive.

45:08.041 --> 45:11.125
You have the technique, the lungs.
You know what to do.

45:12.041 --> 45:14.625
Things get complicated
the day of the competition.

45:14.708 --> 45:18.416
When you're alone with your team,
you have enough oxygen for a week.

45:19.125 --> 45:21.500
But when the countdown
with the judges starts…

45:21.583 --> 45:24.666
The pressure, the crowd,
the noise, the countdown…

45:24.750 --> 45:26.916
That's what separates
the men from the boys.

45:29.000 --> 45:29.916
You ready?

45:32.500 --> 45:33.583
Okay.

46:28.000 --> 46:33.125
AIDA GRAND PRIX
BARI, ITALY SEPTEMBER 2016

46:40.375 --> 46:42.125
Five. Four.

46:42.208 --> 46:44.208
Three. Two.

46:44.291 --> 46:46.083
One. Official top!

47:19.708 --> 47:22.000
-What's happening?
-No, thanks.

47:23.583 --> 47:25.250
-She's gotta…
-You wish!

48:12.375 --> 48:13.500
I'm okay.

48:18.375 --> 48:21.458
Roxana Aubry, 56 meters!

48:21.541 --> 48:24.125
A new French women's record in CWF!

48:24.208 --> 48:26.083
You got it!

48:26.666 --> 48:27.583
You did it!

48:29.708 --> 48:33.208
Congratulations again, Roxana,
for that amazing dive of yours.

48:33.291 --> 48:36.166
You're the best French freediver today.
How does it feel?

48:36.250 --> 48:38.958
Well, it feels good.
It feels really good.

48:39.458 --> 48:42.208
But I never could have
done it without him.

48:42.291 --> 48:43.250
Pascal Gautier.

48:43.333 --> 48:47.583
Indeed, who knows the depths better than
Pascal Gautier? But you already know that.

48:48.208 --> 48:49.041
Mwah!

48:49.125 --> 48:50.375
-No, thank you, guys.
-Thank you.

48:50.458 --> 48:52.250
-Are you proud?
-Well, yeah, I am.

48:52.333 --> 48:55.208
-You deserve it.
-That RMC journalist is a bit of a boor.

48:55.291 --> 48:56.916
-Are you Pascal?
-Well, no.

48:57.000 --> 48:58.625
-He was really weird.
-I'm Roxana's mother.

48:58.708 --> 49:01.833
Nice to meet you. A pleasure.
Did you have a nice trip down?

49:01.916 --> 49:02.791
-Mom?
-Yes, I did.

49:02.875 --> 49:05.041
-What are you doing here?
-Oh, well.

49:05.833 --> 49:09.250
I had no idea this event
would be so… important.

49:10.041 --> 49:12.666
But why are you here?
You don't like the beach. Uh…

49:12.750 --> 49:14.250
Or boats, or the ocean, I mean…

49:14.333 --> 49:15.791
Why are you so aggressive?

49:17.291 --> 49:18.666
What's the problem here?

49:18.750 --> 49:21.416
All this isn't good for her. It's harmful.

49:21.500 --> 49:24.208
-You don't even know my daughter.
-Mom! Don't say that.

49:24.291 --> 49:26.041
You shouldn't risk your life like this!

49:26.125 --> 49:28.458
-How are you not able to see that?
-Mom, just quit it!

49:29.250 --> 49:32.500
-She's fragile. She's--
-Stop it! Just hold on, we need a minute.

49:40.375 --> 49:42.000
I think you should just come home.

49:42.083 --> 49:44.666
Stop it. I know what you're doing,
and it's pointless.

49:46.250 --> 49:47.208
Hmm.

49:49.500 --> 49:51.125
That was impressive today.

49:51.708 --> 49:52.916
Very impressive.

49:56.250 --> 49:57.375
And you're good.

49:58.750 --> 50:01.166
I told Grandpa about it.
He couldn't believe it.

50:01.666 --> 50:03.083
He was overjoyed.

50:05.291 --> 50:06.375
How's he doing?

50:06.458 --> 50:07.541
Good.

50:08.041 --> 50:11.958
Of course, his heart is still weak.
That's not going to change. But he's fine.

50:12.708 --> 50:14.083
He misses you.

50:18.875 --> 50:20.666
I'm not going home with you.

50:21.958 --> 50:23.208
I know that.

50:30.583 --> 50:32.083
Take care of yourself.

51:58.000 --> 51:59.041
You okay, my love?

52:11.500 --> 52:12.416
You okay?

52:15.083 --> 52:16.375
Uh-huh.

52:22.666 --> 52:24.125
What's on your mind?

52:25.541 --> 52:28.250
Don't worry, I'll be right there.
Just go back to bed.

52:37.833 --> 52:41.541

52:43.833 --> 52:46.958
DAY 2

52:49.208 --> 52:50.125
You find him?

52:51.125 --> 52:52.541
He's not on board.

52:52.625 --> 52:53.708
I'm not sure he's coming.

52:53.791 --> 52:56.791
Of course. The only interview
we all need to be present for.

52:57.875 --> 52:59.541
How long's that guy been under?

53:00.041 --> 53:01.250
Two minutes 50.

53:05.000 --> 53:06.166
Here he comes!

53:07.833 --> 53:09.625
Get his head.

53:09.750 --> 53:11.708
-Come on.
-Breathe, breathe, breathe.

53:13.458 --> 53:15.125
Come on, come on. Breathe!

53:17.375 --> 53:18.208
He's okay.

53:18.291 --> 53:20.875
Well, at least there won't be
any new world record.

53:21.791 --> 53:23.958
Hey, hey, hey. Is she the American?

53:24.041 --> 53:25.041
-Yeah.
-Wow.

53:25.125 --> 53:26.083
Yeah.

53:27.000 --> 53:28.791
She wants to get to 178 meters.

53:28.875 --> 53:30.000
What?

53:30.083 --> 53:32.625
Her last competition,
she reached 130 meters.

53:32.708 --> 53:33.958
-Well…
-You sure?

53:34.041 --> 53:36.958
-Suit yourself.
-She wants to beat the record like that?

53:37.041 --> 53:40.166
-They'll never let her.
-They will. She did it during training.

53:40.250 --> 53:42.958
They're watching the video now.
She's gonna beat the men's record.

53:44.458 --> 53:46.708
-She'll do it.
-Oh, you think I will, huh?

53:47.916 --> 53:50.458
-<i>Hi…</i>
-And he won't pick up his fucking phone.

53:51.500 --> 53:54.125
Five. Four. Three.

53:54.208 --> 53:56.291
Two. One<i>.</i>

53:56.375 --> 53:57.500
Official top!

54:23.916 --> 54:25.166
Amazing.

54:25.250 --> 54:27.166
-Thank you.
-Congratulations.

54:27.250 --> 54:28.250
Nice work.

54:28.875 --> 54:29.875
Congrats!

54:31.541 --> 54:33.083
-Thank you.
-Well done.

54:40.666 --> 54:42.125
Guys, I wanna dive.

54:43.333 --> 54:44.500
Does he know about the record?

54:44.583 --> 54:46.791
-Set it to 180.
-Why do you think we're here?

54:46.875 --> 54:48.333
He wants to reach 180 meters.

54:49.500 --> 54:51.791
He's crazy if he thinks we're gonna
watch him self-destruct.

54:51.875 --> 54:53.833
-I'm gonna dive!
-Please listen. It wasn't planned.

54:53.916 --> 54:56.333
You know I have to beat it. I'm doing it.

54:56.416 --> 54:59.208
-I don't wanna see this.
-They'll never let him. Plus, no time.

54:59.916 --> 55:01.250
All right, let's go.

55:01.833 --> 55:03.458
-He's out of his mind.
-Yeah.

55:03.541 --> 55:06.250
-I'm ready. I'll destroy her. And you too!
-No. No!

55:06.333 --> 55:07.833
-Oh, okay…
-You'll fucking regret this.

55:07.916 --> 55:09.166
Hey, whoa, calm down.

55:09.875 --> 55:12.083
Fuck you! I won't forget this.

55:12.166 --> 55:15.000
-Calm down, Pascal.
-Let's go! Come on, let's go!

55:15.083 --> 55:16.583
You want me to drive, or what?

55:23.083 --> 55:25.041
Okay, thank you, thank you.

55:25.125 --> 55:26.208
Ladies and gentlemen,

55:26.791 --> 55:30.041
we have a national record
for a new French diver.

55:30.125 --> 55:32.750
And that's not necessarily a big deal,

55:32.833 --> 55:35.083
but the woman who made this record,

55:35.791 --> 55:38.541
this was her very first competitive dive.

55:38.625 --> 55:40.916
And that's a big deal.

55:43.166 --> 55:46.791
Ladies and gentlemen,
a new record for France

55:47.291 --> 55:49.541
in the Constant Weight with Fins category…

55:49.625 --> 55:51.416
56 meters.

55:51.916 --> 55:55.083
Allow me to introduce Roxana Aubry!

56:07.166 --> 56:08.791
Whoo! Yes!

56:10.375 --> 56:11.500
Oh, hang on a second.

56:11.583 --> 56:13.166
Yeah, there…

56:13.250 --> 56:17.333
-Now, the Earth shatters under our feet.
-That's you!

56:17.416 --> 56:19.708
For the first time ever in our sport,

56:19.791 --> 56:23.083
a woman replaces a man
for the world record

56:23.166 --> 56:27.000
to the deepest place
a human has gone in the sea.

56:27.583 --> 56:30.791
Ladies and gentlemen,
the champion of the deep,

56:31.625 --> 56:35.625
holding a new world record of 178 meters,

56:36.166 --> 56:38.000
Naomi Clarke!

56:39.833 --> 56:41.083
Naomi!

56:41.708 --> 56:42.583
Naomi!

56:45.583 --> 56:47.291
Naomi!

56:49.083 --> 56:50.375
Naomi!

56:51.416 --> 56:52.833
Yeah!

56:53.333 --> 56:54.958
Naomi!

56:58.875 --> 57:01.125
Congratulations. Congratulations.

57:01.208 --> 57:02.250
There you go!

57:04.833 --> 57:08.125
<i> </i>You call this late?

57:10.875 --> 57:12.958
-<i>Buongiorno, è possibile…</i>
-Thank you.

57:13.041 --> 57:14.541
<i>Sì, perfetto.</i>

57:14.625 --> 57:16.291
Hup! Hup!

57:16.375 --> 57:18.541
Great. Hup!

57:19.208 --> 57:21.333
I'm gonna walk a little.
I'll take a taxi.

57:21.416 --> 57:22.583
-Really?
-Why?

57:22.666 --> 57:23.541
-Because.
-No.

57:23.625 --> 57:26.000
-You're not walking home!
-I need some air. It's fine.

57:26.083 --> 57:28.208
-Come on, get in!
-No, go ahead, it's okay.

57:28.291 --> 57:31.541
-Wait, she doesn't have the key!
-We love you, Roxy!

57:36.583 --> 57:37.750
Hey, Roxy!

57:38.333 --> 57:40.000
Wait for me!

57:42.250 --> 57:43.666
I couldn't stay there.

57:45.708 --> 57:47.000
You could have tried.

57:50.875 --> 57:52.666
It was an important moment for me.

57:53.666 --> 57:55.791
I have nothing to do
with your record getting beaten.

57:55.875 --> 57:58.458
Beaten? That whole dive was bullshit!

57:58.541 --> 58:00.000
Did you see the video?

58:00.083 --> 58:02.208
-No.
-Well, she's an imposter.

58:02.291 --> 58:04.666
-And I'm winning my title back.
-What are you even saying?

58:04.750 --> 58:08.166
I'm not gonna stop competing
'cause of a couple unlucky dives, okay?

58:08.250 --> 58:09.750
Just let your body rest!

58:10.666 --> 58:12.125
Listen to the doctors.

58:12.208 --> 58:15.541
You've gotta be kidding.
I'm never going to!

58:15.625 --> 58:18.375
I'd rather anyone else hold this record.
Even you.

58:18.958 --> 58:22.083
Because I saw you back there. I saw
the way that you loved the spotlight.

58:22.166 --> 58:24.875
-That's really sad.
-That's really sad?

58:26.166 --> 58:27.291
Oh, yeah?

58:29.291 --> 58:30.708
I'll tell you what's sad.

58:31.708 --> 58:33.375
My father left when I was five.

58:34.708 --> 58:36.208
He beat my mother every night.

58:39.041 --> 58:41.041
And we were relieved
when he finally left us.

58:42.083 --> 58:43.583
And then my mother left.

58:45.166 --> 58:48.541
The poor woman couldn't take care of me.
She drank so much.

58:49.541 --> 58:51.333
But now look at me today.

58:52.208 --> 58:54.000
I've set 25 world records.

58:54.958 --> 58:58.125
There are those who sit in the sun
and those who touch the sun.

58:58.625 --> 59:02.541
I built this myself. I got my revenge
on everything and everyone.

59:02.625 --> 59:05.625
Threw back every punch I got.
And I'm not tired of fighting.

59:06.375 --> 59:07.375
I'm a champion.

59:09.291 --> 59:11.708
But I guess you think
that's also sad, don't you?

59:13.416 --> 59:16.208
-I'm sorry, but that's not what I meant--
-It's fine, forget it.

59:19.291 --> 59:20.833
I need a little air.

59:21.416 --> 59:23.000
You go back to the hotel.

59:41.750 --> 59:45.041
<i>Hi. You've reached Pascal Gautier.</i>
<i>I'm unavailable at the moment.</i>

59:45.125 --> 59:47.750
<i>Leave a message after the beep. Thank you.</i>

59:56.000 --> 59:59.000
<i>Hi. You've reached Pascal Gautier.</i>
<i>I'm unavailable at the moment.</i>

59:59.083 --> 1:00:01.333
<i>Leave a message after the beep.</i>

1:00:11.000 --> 1:00:13.958
<i>Hi. You've reached Pascal Gautier.</i>
<i>I'm unavailable at the moment.</i>

1:00:16.625 --> 1:00:17.958
Give me that.

1:00:24.958 --> 1:00:26.083
No, I'm good.

1:00:26.666 --> 1:00:29.875
-How you feelin'?
-Tired. Have you seen Pascal?

1:00:30.458 --> 1:00:32.791
-He didn't mention it?
-No. What do you mean?

1:00:34.958 --> 1:00:36.125
Wait. What's going on?

1:00:36.666 --> 1:00:38.833
He needed to be alone.
He left for Kalamata.

1:00:40.000 --> 1:00:42.333
They wouldn't let him dive
because he blacked out.

1:00:42.833 --> 1:00:45.041
I'm sorry. I thought he'd said something.

1:00:46.791 --> 1:00:49.291
No, he did. I just didn't know
he'd be leaving so early.

1:00:49.375 --> 1:00:51.250
Hey, I know Léa was sad to say goodbye.

1:00:51.333 --> 1:00:52.666
How would you know that?

1:00:53.583 --> 1:00:54.875
-No.
-Stéph?

1:00:57.625 --> 1:00:59.208
Are the blackouts really serious?

1:00:59.833 --> 1:01:03.125
Well, they're not good.
It happens to some divers, with age.

1:01:04.208 --> 1:01:06.958
The problem is that once they start,
they rarely stop.

1:01:09.375 --> 1:01:10.291
There you have it.

1:01:15.208 --> 1:01:16.750
You want me to call Pascal?

1:01:17.291 --> 1:01:20.125
No. If I needed to call him,
then I'd call him myself.

1:01:20.208 --> 1:01:21.291
All right, let's go.

1:01:39.666 --> 1:01:41.583
See, for me, this is the real deal.

1:01:42.083 --> 1:01:44.291
No fins. No sled.

1:01:44.791 --> 1:01:46.666
No lift bag for resurfacing.

1:01:46.750 --> 1:01:50.208
Just you, your strength,
and your know-how.

1:01:50.916 --> 1:01:54.166
You've got the technique.
You've got the lungs. You're gifted.

1:01:54.250 --> 1:01:55.458
I'm not kidding.

1:01:55.541 --> 1:01:58.291
Some people immediately excel in sports.

1:01:58.375 --> 1:02:01.458
It's rare, especially
in freediving, but still.

1:02:02.041 --> 1:02:02.916
You…

1:02:03.416 --> 1:02:05.291
You have a natural physiology for it.

1:02:05.375 --> 1:02:06.291
And that…

1:02:06.958 --> 1:02:08.125
That is a gift.

1:02:08.833 --> 1:02:10.208
But it's not enough.

1:02:10.291 --> 1:02:11.791
What matters most

1:02:12.791 --> 1:02:13.875
is your mind.

1:02:14.791 --> 1:02:17.541
Visualize the dive
as if you were in a training session.

1:02:18.291 --> 1:02:19.583
Stay focused.

1:02:20.083 --> 1:02:21.041
Stay calm.

1:02:21.541 --> 1:02:22.625
There.

1:02:23.583 --> 1:02:25.083
Long breath in…

1:02:30.458 --> 1:02:31.375
What is it?

1:02:33.750 --> 1:02:36.208
-I'm not sure I'm ready.
-Of course you're ready.

1:02:36.291 --> 1:02:39.916
I wouldn't let you dive if I didn't
think you could do it. All right?

1:02:41.583 --> 1:02:43.375
It's not the same without him.

1:02:43.458 --> 1:02:44.375
Roxy.

1:02:45.375 --> 1:02:47.958
You don't need Pascal.
You don't need anyone.

1:02:53.291 --> 1:02:55.041
You don't even need me, so…

1:02:58.666 --> 1:02:59.666
Thanks.

1:03:08.000 --> 1:03:12.333
HELLENIC FREEDIVING CUP
KALAMATA, GREECE OCTOBER 2016

1:04:11.541 --> 1:04:13.958
And it's a…
it's a beautiful kind of meditation

1:04:14.041 --> 1:04:16.750
when you're that deep underwater.

1:04:16.833 --> 1:04:18.791
But what really
makes it unique is, uh…

1:04:18.875 --> 1:04:21.375
It's… it's the loneliest team sport.

1:04:21.916 --> 1:04:26.166
A lot of fans have recently commented
on the fact that freediving as a sport

1:04:26.666 --> 1:04:29.041
is being taken over by gorgeous women.

1:04:30.125 --> 1:04:32.791
Which, for me,
isn't necessarily a problem, but…

1:04:32.875 --> 1:04:38.291
I was wondering if you cared to comment on
both your newfound role as a star athlete

1:04:39.708 --> 1:04:40.791
and, let's be honest…

1:04:41.541 --> 1:04:42.458
a sex symbol.

1:04:42.541 --> 1:04:44.375
Whoa.

1:04:45.208 --> 1:04:46.958
Oh, I don't know, it's, uh…

1:04:47.041 --> 1:04:50.291
It's not very feminist,
but thank you for saying that.

1:04:50.875 --> 1:04:51.791
Um…

1:04:52.291 --> 1:04:54.375
I'm not a star athlete yet.

1:04:54.458 --> 1:04:57.583
Uh… And I'm definitely not a sex symbol.

1:04:57.666 --> 1:04:59.666
Yes, you are!

1:05:00.250 --> 1:05:03.083
Uh, no, no, but I think it's, um…

1:05:03.166 --> 1:05:05.166
It's a very interesting moment
in this sport.

1:05:05.250 --> 1:05:07.833
One where the… the line is blurring
between men and women,

1:05:07.916 --> 1:05:10.041
and it's just about who's the best.

1:05:11.791 --> 1:05:12.958
Or maybe that's naive.

1:05:13.041 --> 1:05:13.958
-Uh…
-Not one bit.

1:05:14.625 --> 1:05:15.666
Congratulations again.

1:05:15.750 --> 1:05:17.333
Ah, thank you.

1:05:19.583 --> 1:05:21.916
I think what you're doing
is so amazing, and…

1:05:22.000 --> 1:05:24.083
Other than being a sex symbol, obviously.

1:05:24.166 --> 1:05:27.000
And now you're really killing it.
I think we got what we wanted, yeah?

1:05:27.083 --> 1:05:29.166
-Everything's good.
-No, uh… thank you.

1:05:29.250 --> 1:05:30.833
I really appreciate this.

1:05:31.500 --> 1:05:33.000
-It's my pleasure.
-Yeah.

1:05:33.083 --> 1:05:34.291
Thanks.

1:05:34.916 --> 1:05:36.166
I think we're all good.

1:05:37.041 --> 1:05:38.625
-Thanks.
-That's all right.

1:05:40.166 --> 1:05:41.333
You came.

1:05:45.291 --> 1:05:47.333
And at just the right time,
apparently.

1:05:49.291 --> 1:05:51.750
What do you mean? Where were you?

1:05:51.833 --> 1:05:54.500
You disappeared
and the team had to tell me you left?

1:05:54.583 --> 1:05:56.125
I said I needed some space.

1:05:56.625 --> 1:05:58.666
You said that you needed to take a walk.

1:06:00.041 --> 1:06:01.083
What was that, huh?

1:06:02.125 --> 1:06:03.083
What was what?

1:06:05.791 --> 1:06:08.458
It doesn't matter whether
I'm here holding your hand or not.

1:06:10.125 --> 1:06:11.833
You're a professional athlete now.

1:06:12.583 --> 1:06:14.375
You're my partner,
and you're part of my team.

1:06:14.458 --> 1:06:16.375
-Yeah, and?
-Then start acting like it!

1:06:18.541 --> 1:06:20.500
Blushing like a schoolgirl
when a guy looks at you.

1:06:20.583 --> 1:06:22.416
Don't forget how we got here.

1:06:36.625 --> 1:06:37.583
<i>Pascal!</i>

1:06:44.250 --> 1:06:45.666
Pascal!

1:06:50.166 --> 1:06:51.666
They're all waiting for you.

1:06:56.916 --> 1:06:58.125
I've been thinking.

1:06:59.041 --> 1:07:00.500
And I think it's time now.

1:07:01.291 --> 1:07:03.708
To go for the record.
We can't leave things how they are.

1:07:03.791 --> 1:07:06.250
-Ugh. Come on.
-Wait. I know what you're about to say.

1:07:07.000 --> 1:07:09.250
That I'm not ready.
That I need more training.

1:07:09.333 --> 1:07:11.541
I'm not in good enough shape. I get that.

1:07:12.083 --> 1:07:13.125
And it's true.

1:07:14.125 --> 1:07:15.916
You're right. I wouldn't be.

1:07:20.166 --> 1:07:21.416
But Roxana is.

1:07:21.500 --> 1:07:24.041
-What's that?
-You know she's more than capable.

1:07:24.541 --> 1:07:26.833
CWF is a lot more complicated
than no limit.

1:07:26.916 --> 1:07:28.666
-Oh, really?
-That right?

1:07:30.125 --> 1:07:32.250
You really think she's ready for no limit?

1:07:34.208 --> 1:07:35.083
Okay.

1:07:36.708 --> 1:07:37.875
Forget about it.

1:07:38.375 --> 1:07:39.375
I quit.

1:07:39.958 --> 1:07:41.166
I quit.

1:07:41.708 --> 1:07:44.750
We've done some crazy stuff together,
Pascal, but this is too far.

1:07:44.833 --> 1:07:46.458
This isn't the time to fucking give up.

1:07:47.041 --> 1:07:50.750
No. You can risk your own life doing this,
but you can't do it with others.

1:07:52.458 --> 1:07:53.375
Stéph.

1:07:53.958 --> 1:07:55.791
-I agree.
-You're kidding.

1:07:56.875 --> 1:07:58.583
This time, I won't do it.

1:07:58.666 --> 1:08:02.083
You think I'd put the love of my life
in danger like that? Just because?

1:08:05.333 --> 1:08:06.625
You actually think that.

1:08:07.500 --> 1:08:08.541
Go ahead.

1:08:09.250 --> 1:08:11.291
Mr. Tom and Mr. Stéphane are out.

1:08:11.875 --> 1:08:13.833
You want out? Do you wanna quit?

1:08:16.458 --> 1:08:17.583
Seriously, you're leaving?

1:08:17.666 --> 1:08:20.291
So after everything we've been
through together, you're bailing.

1:08:20.375 --> 1:08:22.625
You want to go home?
Then beat it, get lost!

1:08:22.708 --> 1:08:25.041
If you don't like it,
then you can just go! All of you, go!

1:08:25.125 --> 1:08:27.083
I don't need anyone here. You got that?

1:08:27.166 --> 1:08:29.041
You're not leaving, I'm firing all of you!

1:08:29.125 --> 1:08:30.958
-Get out! All of you!
-Stop it!

1:08:31.041 --> 1:08:32.791
All of you, sit down!

1:08:32.875 --> 1:08:37.041
I am tired of everyone else
making my decisions and speaking for me.

1:08:38.250 --> 1:08:40.166
Pascal wouldn't put me in danger.

1:08:42.625 --> 1:08:45.833
And just stop talking about me
like I'm not even fucking here!

1:08:45.916 --> 1:08:47.291
I'm right here!

1:08:50.208 --> 1:08:52.083
Doing this dive is my choice.

1:08:52.166 --> 1:08:53.666
I'm not doing this for Pascal.

1:08:54.166 --> 1:08:55.416
I'm doing this for me.

1:09:05.625 --> 1:09:06.833
Is this your father?

1:09:07.333 --> 1:09:08.708
No.

1:09:09.250 --> 1:09:10.250
That's my uncle.

1:09:10.916 --> 1:09:12.125
The one who raised me.

1:09:18.916 --> 1:09:20.916
He's the one who taught me how to dive.

1:09:24.166 --> 1:09:26.375
Back then,
I could barely hold the spear gun.

1:09:28.166 --> 1:09:29.541
You'll have your comeback.

1:09:31.916 --> 1:09:33.041
You don't know.

1:09:36.208 --> 1:09:37.708
Maybe you're right, but…

1:09:39.750 --> 1:09:42.625
I know what it's like to…
feel like it's over.

1:09:50.000 --> 1:09:51.458
I was an awkward kid.

1:09:52.833 --> 1:09:55.291
I had braces. I was skinny.

1:09:56.833 --> 1:09:58.416
I told you that.

1:10:00.458 --> 1:10:01.375
But…

1:10:02.166 --> 1:10:03.166
I felt alone.

1:10:07.916 --> 1:10:10.375
My dad killed himself when I was 12.

1:10:10.458 --> 1:10:12.750
Depression. He refused to get help.

1:10:15.250 --> 1:10:16.541
He was so young.

1:10:17.291 --> 1:10:18.708
My mother was a wreck.

1:10:19.875 --> 1:10:22.541
I was… I don't know.

1:10:23.458 --> 1:10:24.750
I just had questions.

1:10:25.791 --> 1:10:27.250
Why did he want to do it?

1:10:28.416 --> 1:10:30.166
Why did he want to leave us?

1:10:32.625 --> 1:10:35.458
Could I… could I have stopped him?

1:10:35.541 --> 1:10:37.333
Or did I do something?

1:10:41.458 --> 1:10:43.916
I kind of got obsessed
with the idea of death.

1:10:47.208 --> 1:10:48.541
What would it feel like?

1:10:50.666 --> 1:10:51.625
Uh…

1:10:54.000 --> 1:10:56.083
And at some point, it was all too much.

1:11:01.541 --> 1:11:03.375
And one day, I just decided.

1:11:05.416 --> 1:11:07.833
That was the day.
That was it, I would join him.

1:11:11.166 --> 1:11:13.041
I filled up the tub with water

1:11:15.750 --> 1:11:17.500
and cut open my wrists.

1:11:26.583 --> 1:11:28.833
My grandfather found me in there.

1:11:30.041 --> 1:11:31.208
And he saved my life.

1:11:35.541 --> 1:11:36.958
That's not who you are now.

1:11:39.458 --> 1:11:41.333
You mean more to me than…

1:11:41.416 --> 1:11:42.916
than any trophy or any record.

1:11:43.000 --> 1:11:44.166
It's the truth.

1:11:48.250 --> 1:11:49.875
I would throw it all away.

1:11:51.416 --> 1:11:54.166
I don't know, give it up,
go to a deserted island with you,

1:11:54.250 --> 1:11:55.708
and have children.

1:12:32.708 --> 1:12:34.541
Oh!

1:13:20.125 --> 1:13:22.166
Why don't we put everything else aside?

1:13:33.416 --> 1:13:35.333
I just want to do what's best for us.

1:13:45.250 --> 1:13:46.625
You already wanna give up?

1:13:47.708 --> 1:13:48.875
We don't give up.

1:13:53.416 --> 1:13:54.666
You're a champion now.

1:13:55.375 --> 1:13:56.541
Thanks to me.

1:13:59.208 --> 1:14:00.875
You wanna be insignificant again?

1:14:02.166 --> 1:14:03.625
Live life in the shadows?

1:14:05.041 --> 1:14:06.250
You're just afraid.

1:14:07.458 --> 1:14:08.333
Right?

1:14:10.000 --> 1:14:11.875
When you're the best, you don't quit.

1:14:12.458 --> 1:14:13.541
I'm going for a walk.

1:14:37.250 --> 1:14:38.541
Okay, okay.

1:14:38.625 --> 1:14:40.833
-How are you?
-Tom!

1:14:40.916 --> 1:14:42.916
-Oh!
-How ya doin'?

1:14:43.750 --> 1:14:45.333
-Oof!
-Mmm!

1:14:45.416 --> 1:14:48.000
-How are you?
-Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

1:14:48.083 --> 1:14:49.708
I'm glad to see you as well.

1:14:51.416 --> 1:14:55.375
-Two shots?
-Two shots. All right, two shots, please.

1:14:56.125 --> 1:14:59.000
-What are you drinkin'?
-Uh, red Martini.

1:15:01.750 --> 1:15:03.875
-What shall we drink to?
-Um…

1:15:03.958 --> 1:15:05.708
-To diving. To the record.
-Okay.

1:15:05.791 --> 1:15:07.708
Here. Here we go.

1:15:07.791 --> 1:15:08.708
Thanks.

1:15:14.125 --> 1:15:15.375
Ugh!

1:15:15.916 --> 1:15:17.583
Bleh!

1:15:18.208 --> 1:15:20.166
You feeling stressed? Are you nervous?

1:15:20.250 --> 1:15:22.708
-You want to--
-Uh, no, no, um…

1:15:22.791 --> 1:15:24.541
-What do you wanna talk about?
-Uhh…

1:15:24.625 --> 1:15:26.875
I'm a little nervous.

1:15:26.958 --> 1:15:28.500
-Mm-hm?
-But…

1:15:29.416 --> 1:15:31.458
I just… I wanted, uh…

1:15:31.541 --> 1:15:34.458
to set things straight with us
before the dive.

1:15:35.125 --> 1:15:36.791
What do you mean?

1:15:40.833 --> 1:15:42.416
Maybe I made the wrong choice.

1:15:51.541 --> 1:15:53.375
You liked me first, didn't you?

1:15:56.416 --> 1:15:57.291
No.

1:15:58.375 --> 1:15:59.333
Hmm.

1:15:59.416 --> 1:16:00.500
Yes, yes.

1:16:01.541 --> 1:16:03.541
Yes. Yes, I liked you, yeah.

1:16:05.458 --> 1:16:07.000
And I think that you liked me.

1:16:12.208 --> 1:16:13.291
I'm so sorry.

1:16:16.208 --> 1:16:18.541
Ooh, you had a fight
with Pascal, didn't you?

1:16:18.625 --> 1:16:19.625
Huh?

1:16:22.041 --> 1:16:23.541
He's cheating on me.

1:16:26.208 --> 1:16:28.458
Look, Roxy, it's best
I don't get myself in the middle.

1:16:28.541 --> 1:16:31.708
No, but I'm not asking you
to verify anything. I already know.

1:16:33.333 --> 1:16:34.958
Everyone does.

1:16:39.541 --> 1:16:41.666
I really am sorry, because I… I--

1:17:03.708 --> 1:17:05.916
-I'm a nice girl, right?
<i>-</i>Yes. Yes.

1:17:06.416 --> 1:17:08.000
You're incredibly nice.

1:17:08.083 --> 1:17:09.791
Yeah, you're amazing.

1:17:10.750 --> 1:17:13.333
But right now, you're drunk. Huh?

1:17:13.416 --> 1:17:15.791
I don't blame you.

1:17:17.833 --> 1:17:20.416
No, but…

1:17:20.500 --> 1:17:22.708
I just don't want you
to regret kissing me.

1:17:23.625 --> 1:17:24.791
Hm?

1:17:40.375 --> 1:17:41.458
Wanna go for a bike ride?

1:17:41.541 --> 1:17:43.041
-Yes!
<i>-</i>Okay.

1:19:03.208 --> 1:19:04.375
I'm okay.

1:19:05.666 --> 1:19:06.541
-Bravo!
-All right!

1:19:06.625 --> 1:19:07.916
-Whoo!
-Yeah!

1:19:08.000 --> 1:19:09.166
-All right!
-Yeah!

1:19:09.250 --> 1:19:10.125
-Yeah!
-Whoo!

1:19:10.208 --> 1:19:11.458
-Nice stuff! Yes!
-Yeah!

1:19:18.000 --> 1:19:20.833
See, I told you guys.
I told you she's a champion.

1:19:22.791 --> 1:19:24.000
I knew you could do it.

1:19:25.166 --> 1:19:26.666
176.

1:19:27.416 --> 1:19:28.416
Boom!

1:19:34.541 --> 1:19:35.625
Set the plate to 180.

1:19:37.208 --> 1:19:38.333
You mean for her?

1:19:38.958 --> 1:19:40.541
Not for her, idiot. For me.

1:19:40.625 --> 1:19:41.833
What?

1:19:43.625 --> 1:19:45.375
180 meters. Do it.

1:20:47.083 --> 1:20:48.125
I'm fine.

1:20:48.875 --> 1:20:49.875
I know.

1:20:50.833 --> 1:20:52.166
I know you're fine.

1:20:55.916 --> 1:20:57.250
Can we talk for a sec?

1:21:04.750 --> 1:21:06.875
What if we took a vacation?

1:21:06.958 --> 1:21:08.416
I told you to stop worrying.

1:21:09.625 --> 1:21:12.583
We could leave all this behind
for a while, just me and you.

1:21:13.083 --> 1:21:14.291
Get away from it all.

1:21:14.375 --> 1:21:15.791
-From the water--
-No!

1:21:16.583 --> 1:21:17.791
-Just a little--
-Quiet!

1:21:20.000 --> 1:21:21.958
Nobody treats me like I'm a child.

1:21:23.125 --> 1:21:24.750
We're not going anywhere.

1:21:25.250 --> 1:21:27.375
When things get bad, I don't run and hide.

1:21:31.541 --> 1:21:33.250
So you're gonna keep training.

1:21:33.958 --> 1:21:36.083
You have a competition in five days.

1:21:37.500 --> 1:21:38.750
You'll be there.

1:21:40.958 --> 1:21:42.000
Okay?

1:22:11.000 --> 1:22:12.250
That's bullshit.

1:22:12.875 --> 1:22:14.000
I swear.

1:22:15.625 --> 1:22:16.541
Okay.

1:22:18.666 --> 1:22:20.875
Okay, that works, yeah. Take care.

1:22:21.791 --> 1:22:22.833
Big hug.

1:22:26.750 --> 1:22:28.000
Who was that?

1:22:32.416 --> 1:22:33.666
No one.

1:22:33.750 --> 1:22:35.958
A friend. Nothing important.

1:22:36.041 --> 1:22:38.375
Well, if it's not important, then tell me.

1:22:39.916 --> 1:22:41.208
You think it was a girl?

1:22:43.125 --> 1:22:46.291
You think I'd flaunt an affair
in your face?

1:22:49.791 --> 1:22:51.000
You're an ass.

1:22:54.708 --> 1:22:57.666
You ask stupid questions,
you get asshole answers.

1:22:59.125 --> 1:23:00.708
I'm goin' out. I need some air.

1:24:45.583 --> 1:24:47.458
Come here!

1:24:54.750 --> 1:24:56.250
Take it easy, huh?

1:24:57.291 --> 1:24:59.333
-You ready?
-Of course.

1:25:27.166 --> 1:25:29.500
Yeah, it's open!

1:25:31.208 --> 1:25:33.041
Hey, Roxy, what's goin' on?

1:25:35.041 --> 1:25:37.250
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:25:38.375 --> 1:25:39.666
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1:25:41.041 --> 1:25:42.416
What's the matter?

1:25:42.916 --> 1:25:44.583
What's going on? Come here.

1:25:51.791 --> 1:25:53.916
-Tell me what's wrong.
-It's too much.

1:25:55.708 --> 1:25:57.458
I'm leaving him. I can't…

1:26:02.125 --> 1:26:03.416
That's good.

1:26:04.833 --> 1:26:06.500
Shhh.

1:26:12.666 --> 1:26:15.083
I wanna do this last dive with you.

1:26:16.166 --> 1:26:17.666
But it's the last.

1:26:20.041 --> 1:26:21.083
Okay.

1:26:22.083 --> 1:26:23.708
-Okay.
-Okay?

1:26:23.791 --> 1:26:25.041
Sure.

1:26:26.416 --> 1:26:27.458
Shhh.

1:26:59.166 --> 1:27:00.708
This time, I'm not drunk.

1:27:02.458 --> 1:27:04.250
-Uh, no?
-No.

1:27:06.916 --> 1:27:08.708
I did make the wrong choice.

1:27:50.500 --> 1:27:51.375
Where were you?

1:27:53.500 --> 1:27:54.625
Hey!

1:28:05.875 --> 1:28:06.875
What are you doin'?

1:28:08.583 --> 1:28:10.541
You tell me. What's it look like?

1:28:10.625 --> 1:28:13.666
-Okay, just calm down.
-Don't tell me to calm down.

1:28:18.125 --> 1:28:19.666
Get away from me!

1:28:20.166 --> 1:28:21.375
Okay, I will.

1:28:23.708 --> 1:28:24.833
We're done.

1:28:25.666 --> 1:28:26.541
Do you hear me?

1:28:27.916 --> 1:28:29.666
I'm done being walked all over.

1:28:29.750 --> 1:28:30.958
Okay, then go.

1:28:32.250 --> 1:28:34.041
But you're the one quitting on us. Not me.

1:28:36.333 --> 1:28:37.416
You cheated. Fine.

1:28:38.000 --> 1:28:40.750
You needed to do that.
That's fine. So did I!

1:28:41.666 --> 1:28:46.083
-It wasn't important. It was meaningless.
-Well, it meant something to me!

1:28:47.958 --> 1:28:51.583
Everything that you and I went through
together had meaning!

1:28:55.250 --> 1:28:57.000
You're the only woman I've ever loved.

1:28:57.083 --> 1:28:59.208
-You know that.
-No, I don't buy it.

1:29:01.916 --> 1:29:03.291
I know it's not easy.

1:29:03.916 --> 1:29:05.125
And that I'm not easy.

1:29:05.625 --> 1:29:08.166
But we're not living
some stupid average life.

1:29:12.250 --> 1:29:15.083
And what we have together,
what we are together…

1:29:15.708 --> 1:29:18.000
It's exceptional. It's rare.

1:29:20.125 --> 1:29:21.833
It comes once in a lifetime.

1:29:23.791 --> 1:29:25.958
Roxana, do you hear me?

1:30:02.333 --> 1:30:03.791
What did you do?

1:30:10.875 --> 1:30:12.291
-I'm sorry.
-No.

1:30:13.625 --> 1:30:15.750
No, Roxy.

1:30:18.875 --> 1:30:20.000
I'm sorry.

1:30:20.875 --> 1:30:21.916
No.

1:31:32.333 --> 1:31:33.291
Okay!

1:31:33.791 --> 1:31:34.875
Okay, not bad.

1:31:34.958 --> 1:31:38.000
Again.
Give me your maximum diving time now.

1:31:44.166 --> 1:31:45.375
I JUST WANTED TO CHECK IN

1:31:45.458 --> 1:31:47.625
-Okay, all good, I've welded it.
-Mm-hm.

1:31:47.708 --> 1:31:48.833
You've got the bar.

1:31:48.916 --> 1:31:50.833
So that's… Here, grab it.

1:31:51.416 --> 1:31:54.333
Whoa! Hey, I said grab it!
Oh! What are you doing?

1:31:55.250 --> 1:31:56.500
Just sending a text.

1:31:57.000 --> 1:31:58.416
Who are you texting?

1:32:06.416 --> 1:32:07.750
TOM
I'M THINKING OF YOU

1:32:07.833 --> 1:32:09.958
ARE YOU OKAY, I JUST WANTED TO CHECK IN

1:32:15.041 --> 1:32:16.875
JANUARY 2017

1:32:16.958 --> 1:32:19.083
<i>Thank you all for coming.</i>

1:32:19.166 --> 1:32:23.166
Pascal Gautier and Roxana Aubry
are here together,

1:32:23.666 --> 1:32:26.375
this time in the capacity
of diver and coach,

1:32:26.458 --> 1:32:28.083
to take some of your questions

1:32:28.166 --> 1:32:31.208
about tomorrow's event
and her record attempt.

1:32:32.125 --> 1:32:33.458
Fabrice, Canal Plus.

1:32:34.083 --> 1:32:36.000
Well, looking at you sitting there, uh…

1:32:36.083 --> 1:32:38.333
Well, I see the two best
French freedivers.

1:32:38.416 --> 1:32:40.708
A living legend with more records
than anyone in this sport,

1:32:40.791 --> 1:32:42.375
and a young woman who came out of nowhere

1:32:42.458 --> 1:32:44.750
and managed to beat
two records in six months.

1:32:44.833 --> 1:32:48.041
And not to mention her upcoming attempt
to reach 180 meters.

1:32:49.375 --> 1:32:50.333
Is there a question?

1:32:50.416 --> 1:32:51.500
There is. Sorry.

1:32:51.583 --> 1:32:55.083
My question is twofold.
First of all, how are you managing

1:32:55.166 --> 1:32:58.833
being in a relationship
where you are constantly both in danger?

1:32:59.750 --> 1:33:03.250
And second, Roxana, could you tell us what
it's like to be trained by your partner?

1:33:03.333 --> 1:33:04.416
Thank you.

1:33:04.500 --> 1:33:06.833
Everyone talks
about the dangers of freediving.

1:33:07.333 --> 1:33:11.041
Actually, it's not the most dangerous,
if you think about race car driving,

1:33:11.541 --> 1:33:13.083
or skiing, or rugby.

1:33:14.875 --> 1:33:16.500
I mean, even cheerleading.

1:33:16.583 --> 1:33:19.625
Do you know how many cheerleaders die
while practicing that sport?

1:33:19.708 --> 1:33:21.833
If it's a real sport.

1:33:21.916 --> 1:33:24.666
Of course it's dangerous.

1:33:24.750 --> 1:33:26.000
But we are very careful.

1:33:26.541 --> 1:33:29.250
And we have the best safety teams
in the entire world.

1:33:31.666 --> 1:33:33.833
Um… And as for the other question,

1:33:34.625 --> 1:33:39.000
for me, if there is trust and love,
you always want to go further.

1:33:40.041 --> 1:33:42.125
I could have never done this without him.

1:33:42.625 --> 1:33:43.625
Thank you.

1:33:45.833 --> 1:33:47.208
Another question?

1:33:47.875 --> 1:33:49.333
Nathalie, TF1.

1:33:53.500 --> 1:33:56.291
Thank you. Roxana, uh…

1:33:56.375 --> 1:33:59.625
You're seen as a feminist model
in the world of sports.

1:34:00.333 --> 1:34:04.166
So, I would like to know,
as a journalist but also as a woman…

1:34:04.250 --> 1:34:07.041
…how you're feeling
as you are about to attempt

1:34:07.125 --> 1:34:10.416
to beat a world record
that used to be held by your partner.

1:34:13.583 --> 1:34:15.166
Roxana?

1:34:15.250 --> 1:34:16.583
A question from TF1.

1:34:17.750 --> 1:34:19.291
Sorry, could you repeat the question?

1:34:19.375 --> 1:34:22.708
Well, I was saying you're considered by
many as a model of feminism, as you know,

1:34:22.791 --> 1:34:25.291
and I wanted to know how you're feeling
as you're preparing--

1:34:25.375 --> 1:34:27.708
Um, sorry. Really sorry. Um…

1:34:28.208 --> 1:34:29.125
Thank you all.

1:34:35.375 --> 1:34:37.916
Um, another question. Guillaume!

1:36:23.875 --> 1:36:28.750
APNEA WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP

1:36:31.291 --> 1:36:33.708
-Tell me about the sled.
-On the platform.

1:36:34.541 --> 1:36:35.958
It hasn't been put on the line yet.

1:36:37.291 --> 1:36:38.125
The parachute?

1:36:38.208 --> 1:36:40.708
Checked it.
The containers are full and ready.

1:36:43.000 --> 1:36:44.750
Where are we on the safety teams?

1:36:49.916 --> 1:36:52.541
-Ready.
-We'll still do a check before the dive.

1:36:56.416 --> 1:36:57.750
And how's she doing?

1:36:59.750 --> 1:37:00.625
She's fine.

1:37:02.458 --> 1:37:03.625
All right.

1:37:23.041 --> 1:37:25.125
Hey. I didn't see you there.

1:37:30.208 --> 1:37:31.958
Things haven't been easy lately.

1:37:32.041 --> 1:37:33.291
Got it?

1:37:33.375 --> 1:37:34.375
Yeah.

1:37:35.791 --> 1:37:37.708
I just wanted you to know that we're good.

1:37:39.125 --> 1:37:40.083
Thanks, man.

1:37:57.791 --> 1:37:59.083
Fifteen minutes.

1:38:19.541 --> 1:38:20.625
My champion.

1:38:26.833 --> 1:38:31.958
<i>Platform one, next category,</i>
<i>no limit world record attempt.</i>

1:38:32.458 --> 1:38:33.583
<i>Platform one.</i>

1:39:02.208 --> 1:39:03.291
Everything okay?

1:39:03.791 --> 1:39:04.666
Just checkin' it.

1:39:05.833 --> 1:39:07.833
Stéph and I already did the final check.

1:39:09.375 --> 1:39:10.416
I know.

1:39:11.708 --> 1:39:13.000
It's good to go.

1:39:14.000 --> 1:39:15.500
Help me get it in the water.

1:39:17.708 --> 1:39:19.375
-One, two.
-Two.

1:39:23.375 --> 1:39:25.041
<i>Thirty seconds to dive.</i>

1:39:26.000 --> 1:39:27.500
<i>Roxana Aubry.</i>

1:39:28.250 --> 1:39:30.375
<i>180 meters.</i>

1:39:47.750 --> 1:39:49.000
<i>Ten seconds.</i>

1:39:49.708 --> 1:39:50.708
You good?

1:42:40.458 --> 1:42:41.541
Three minutes 40!

1:42:41.625 --> 1:42:43.750
Something's wrong. The sled's not moving.

1:42:44.375 --> 1:42:45.625
What's goin' on?

1:42:46.208 --> 1:42:47.208
Shit.

1:43:02.583 --> 1:43:04.500
It's taking too long. I'm going up.

1:43:05.041 --> 1:43:06.083
Tom! Tom!

1:43:06.166 --> 1:43:07.083
DANGER
STOP ASCENT

1:43:07.166 --> 1:43:08.916
Stop! Stop!

1:43:09.000 --> 1:43:11.916
You can't yet! No! Stop!

1:43:12.000 --> 1:43:13.333
Stop!

1:43:13.416 --> 1:43:15.791
-Let go of me!
-Don't! No, don't do it!

1:43:15.875 --> 1:43:19.250
-No! Let go of me! Let go!
-Stop! Stop!

1:43:21.125 --> 1:43:23.500
You can't resurface yet. Wait!

1:43:23.583 --> 1:43:24.833
No!

1:44:25.625 --> 1:44:28.208
Ah! Bring her out! Go!

1:44:37.250 --> 1:44:39.250
Six minutes and 50 seconds!

1:44:58.458 --> 1:44:59.583
That's several minutes.

1:45:12.541 --> 1:45:13.416
Here they are!

1:45:20.541 --> 1:45:21.791
Prep the team!

1:45:23.625 --> 1:45:24.916
She's coming up.

1:45:42.708 --> 1:45:44.125
That's it! Tilt back.

1:45:44.208 --> 1:45:45.250
Roxana!

1:45:46.125 --> 1:45:47.458
Roxana, breathe!

1:45:48.500 --> 1:45:50.416
Out of the way!
Out of the fucking way!

1:45:51.041 --> 1:45:53.166
Make some room! Go, go!

1:45:54.375 --> 1:45:56.666
-Out of the water.
-Fucking hurry up!

1:45:58.291 --> 1:45:59.833
Bring her out!

1:45:59.916 --> 1:46:02.125
Roxana! Shit, come on!

1:46:02.625 --> 1:46:04.458
-Roxana!
-Right now.

1:46:04.541 --> 1:46:05.916
Hurry, move!

1:46:06.000 --> 1:46:08.916
-Let's go, let's go, let's go!
-Come on! Come on!

1:46:09.500 --> 1:46:11.666
Roxana! Roxana, can you hear me?

1:46:13.208 --> 1:46:14.333
Medic!

1:46:15.166 --> 1:46:17.500
Just breathe. Can you hear me, Roxana?

1:46:17.583 --> 1:46:18.541
Shit! Fuck!

1:46:18.625 --> 1:46:20.333
Fuck, she's stopped breathing!

1:46:20.416 --> 1:46:21.291
Oxygen!

1:47:51.875 --> 1:47:52.958
Mr. Carole?

1:48:01.375 --> 1:48:05.083
You're saying you checked the tank
that was supposed to fill the lift bag?

1:48:06.416 --> 1:48:07.958
The lift bag too, yeah.

1:48:09.250 --> 1:48:11.500
I checked everything with Stéphane Géralt.

1:48:11.583 --> 1:48:12.791
And it was full?

1:48:14.875 --> 1:48:17.000
We check everything before every dive.

1:48:18.625 --> 1:48:20.416
It was full and functional.

1:48:21.750 --> 1:48:25.291
And when Miss Aubry reached the bottom
and tried to open it?

1:48:32.583 --> 1:48:33.666
It was empty.

1:48:43.458 --> 1:48:46.666
What do you think happened
to all that air?

1:49:24.375 --> 1:49:26.083
There you are, sir, we're here.

1:49:29.458 --> 1:49:30.458
Thanks.
