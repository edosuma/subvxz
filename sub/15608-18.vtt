to my drainpipe.

00:37.460 --> 00:40.000
So he's
duct-taped, then?

00:40.000 --> 00:45.210
The first event
is the tug of war
over the potato pool.

00:45.210 --> 00:47.920
Grizzlies and Weasels,
you're up.

00:47.920 --> 00:50.380
Winner plays Woodchucks.

00:50.380 --> 00:53.420

Needs more butter.

Woodchucks, you're next.
And hurry up!

01:09.460 --> 01:13.250

Hey, Weasels.
Still crying tater-tears

02:14.210 --> 02:17.120
over losing the tug of war
to us Woodchucks?

02:17.120 --> 02:18.920
I can't believe
Crystal fell for the old,

02:18.920 --> 02:20.080
"Your dad lost his job

02:20.080 --> 02:21.710
"and has to pull you

02:21.710 --> 02:22.960
Cheaters!

You know what they say,

02:24.420 --> 02:26.920
"All's fair in love
and tug of war."

02:28.000 --> 02:29.460
You guys
should be ashamed.

I can't hear
what you're saying!

02:36.500 --> 02:38.120
But I hate you.

02:40.960 --> 02:42.250
(IN DEEP VOICE)
Hey, everybody,

02:42.250 --> 02:47.000
it's me, the Grizzly Cabin
mascot, Beary!

02:47.000 --> 02:49.080
(IN NORMAL VOICE)
Guys, it's just me, Jorge!

02:50.710 --> 02:52.380
No kidding.

02:52.380 --> 02:55.210
BTW, that costume
does not look anything

02:55.210 --> 02:56.420
like a grizzly bear.

02:56.420 --> 02:57.540
Who cares?

02:57.540 --> 03:00.040
It came with
a top hat.

03:00.040 --> 03:03.580
I can be classy
while I'm shaking
my chassis.

03:03.580 --> 03:07.250
(IN DEEP VOICE) Hey, Gladys,
how many bonus points
does this move get us?

03:07.920 --> 03:09.620
(SCATTING)

03:09.620 --> 03:11.830
I'll give you
five points...
To stop!

03:13.580 --> 03:15.790
Okay, it's time
for the second event.

03:15.790 --> 03:19.250
Are you ready to play
The Friendship Game?

03:19.250 --> 03:22.500
(ALL CHEERING)

03:22.500 --> 03:26.380
Now, I've already asked
our contestants questions
about each other.

03:26.380 --> 03:29.670
Match your partner's answer,
and you get a point.
(CHUCKLES)

03:29.670 --> 03:33.420
Lou, what is Emma's
favorite word?

03:34.250 --> 03:36.460
Uh... "Duh!"

03:36.460 --> 03:39.080
I don't need your attitude.
I need the answer.

03:39.080 --> 03:41.040
She's right!
It's "duh"!

03:44.500 --> 03:46.250
Wait, where's
Zuri and Tiffany?

03:46.250 --> 03:47.670
I thought they
were our mascot.

03:47.670 --> 03:49.380
I don't know,

03:49.380 --> 03:51.080
but Crystal is killing it
over there as the
Weasel mascot.

03:54.540 --> 03:56.380
Zuri, we're late
for the friendship game!

03:56.380 --> 03:58.420
Our team needs
their mascot...

03:58.420 --> 04:01.580
(IN SQUEAKY VOICE)
Woody the woodchuck!

04:01.580 --> 04:07.210
There's no way
I'm going out
dressed as a giant tuchus.

04:07.210 --> 04:11.120
Zuri, a two-person mascot
is gonna get us
double the points.

04:11.120 --> 04:15.830
Besides, the downstairs
cheeks are just as cool
as the upstairs cheeks.

04:15.830 --> 04:21.250
I'm not taking "cool advice"
from someone with a poster
that says, "Geologists Rock!"

04:22.880 --> 04:25.080
Well, I can't go out there
without a butt!

04:25.080 --> 04:28.580
Sorry, but I'm too cute to be
hidden in a furry derriere.

04:28.580 --> 04:31.120
Does this look like
a radio face to you?

04:32.790 --> 04:37.420
Okay, our teams are tied,
and this is our last round.

04:37.420 --> 04:41.710
Lydia, what is Hazel's
favorite place to hang out?

04:41.710 --> 04:44.420
Um...
In Xander's shadow?

04:44.420 --> 04:46.540
No, the beach!

04:48.580 --> 04:53.790
Emma,
what is the name of Lou's
favorite farm animal?

04:53.790 --> 04:55.920
Easy.
Gary the goat.

04:55.920 --> 04:57.960
No!
It's Gertie the goat!

04:57.960 --> 05:00.250
Gary is my llama!

05:00.250 --> 05:03.210
It's like you don't
know me at all!

05:03.210 --> 05:05.000
It's hard to keep up
with all your animals.

05:05.000 --> 05:06.460
Your family
keeps eating them!

05:08.210 --> 05:11.380
Okay, Grizzlies,
if you get this,
you win.

05:11.380 --> 05:16.330
Xander,
what is the name
of Ravi's favorite pet?

05:16.330 --> 05:17.460
Mrs. Kipling!

05:17.460 --> 05:20.330
Although, he doesn't
think of her as a pet.

05:20.330 --> 05:23.580
She's a companion,
best friend,
and mother figure.

05:23.580 --> 05:24.580
It's complicated.

05:25.670 --> 05:27.250
Talk about TMI.

05:28.580 --> 05:30.080
He is correct!

05:30.080 --> 05:33.380
MS. GLADYS:
Well, it's all there
word for word.

05:33.380 --> 05:35.960
That's the game.
Grizzlies win!

05:35.960 --> 05:37.500
(GRIZZLIES CHEERING)

05:37.500 --> 05:40.120
Yes! In your face!

05:40.120 --> 05:42.380
Cha-ching!
Cha-ching!

05:42.380 --> 05:45.330
What are you,
a cash register?

05:46.210 --> 05:47.210
Got him.

05:52.380 --> 05:54.710
Lou, I'm really sorry
I lost us that game,

05:54.710 --> 05:56.580
but we can still win
the soapbox derby event.

05:56.580 --> 05:59.670
How? Ravi will make
some super-duper
science mobile,

05:59.670 --> 06:02.170
and nerd his way
to the finish line.

06:02.170 --> 06:05.540
Don't worry,
we'll think of something.

06:05.540 --> 06:11.170
Well, maybe you could use
your personal connections to
help us win the race.

06:11.170 --> 06:13.460
I called Vin Diesel to see
if he could drive our car,

06:13.460 --> 06:16.290
but he's shooting
a movie in Rome.

06:16.290 --> 06:20.040
No... Someone else
you know and love.

06:20.040 --> 06:21.330
(GASPS) Beyonce?

06:21.330 --> 06:23.580
But she doesn't drive,
she has a chauffeur.

06:24.170 --> 06:25.920
I meant Xander!

06:25.920 --> 06:28.290
Ask him what the boys
are using to power their car,

06:28.290 --> 06:30.380
so we can
sabotage them.

06:30.380 --> 06:32.250
Lou, that's cheating.

06:32.250 --> 06:34.750
No, it's not.
It's playing to win.

06:34.750 --> 06:37.170
Like stealing signs
in baseball.

06:37.170 --> 06:39.880
Huh?

06:39.880 --> 06:43.540
It's like finding out
what your frenemy's
wearing to a party

06:43.540 --> 06:46.290
and making sure
you wear a hotter dress.

06:46.290 --> 06:48.620
Oh, got it.

06:48.620 --> 06:51.250
But I feel weird
using Xander like that.

06:51.250 --> 06:55.290
Come on, Xander's cabin
wins every year.

06:55.290 --> 06:58.460
You'd make your favorite
person in the world
very happy.

06:58.460 --> 07:00.710
I really don't think
Beyonce cares...
No, me!

07:02.290 --> 07:04.330
Please, bestie?

07:04.330 --> 07:07.920
Okay, fine, I'll do it,
but I'll feel terrible.

07:07.920 --> 07:10.330
Let the espionage begin.

07:10.330 --> 07:15.580
(WHISPERING) From here on out,
we have to be secretive
and talk like spies.

07:15.580 --> 07:18.830
I really don't think
that's...
Shh! Spy talk.

07:25.670 --> 07:27.670
Hey, Xander,
I was thinking...

07:27.670 --> 07:29.210
I was thinking, too!

07:29.210 --> 07:30.750
That's what's
so great about us.

07:30.750 --> 07:32.750
We're always
on the same page.

07:32.750 --> 07:35.580
Yeah, it's like
we're one mind.
(CHUCKLES)

07:35.580 --> 07:39.830
And what would that mind say
the Grizzlies are doing
for the soap box derby?

07:39.830 --> 07:43.330
We haven't figured it out yet,
but I'm so glad
you brought that up.

07:43.330 --> 07:44.830
The thing is...

07:45.580 --> 07:48.080
I have to beat Lou.

07:48.080 --> 07:51.380
Why?
Because I don't want
you to date a loser.

07:51.380 --> 07:53.830
You deserve a winner.

07:53.830 --> 07:58.290
So I need you to tell me
how Lou is going to power
the Woodchuck car.

07:58.290 --> 08:00.620
Wait, you want me
to cheat on my own team?

08:00.620 --> 08:02.170
It's not cheating.

08:02.170 --> 08:04.710
It's like finding out
what your frenemy's
wearing to a party,

08:04.710 --> 08:06.000
and wearing
a hotter dress.

08:06.000 --> 08:08.880
That is a good point,

08:08.880 --> 08:11.920
but it makes me think
we should stop
binge-watching chick flicks.

08:11.920 --> 08:14.330
It's changing you.

08:14.330 --> 08:18.120
I know it's a lot to ask,
but I am your boo.

08:18.120 --> 08:20.920
And you don't want to
see your boo boo-hoo,
do you?

08:22.210 --> 08:24.250
Okay, I'll do it.

08:24.250 --> 08:26.080
But I'm going to
feel terrible.

08:26.080 --> 08:27.580
Works for me!

08:27.580 --> 08:29.460
You really are
the best girlfriend.

08:36.920 --> 08:37.920
LOU: Psst!

08:39.170 --> 08:40.920
(SCREAMS)

08:40.920 --> 08:43.420
Okay, I know
we're in spy mode,
but this is a little much.

08:43.420 --> 08:47.500
Keep your voice down,
and pretend I'm a bush,
so no one notices us.

08:47.500 --> 08:51.120
Okay, so you think
I'll draw less attention
if I'm talking to a bush?

08:52.290 --> 08:54.880
Don't overthink it.

08:54.880 --> 08:59.040
Now, have you figured out
how the boys are powering
their car for the derby race?

08:59.040 --> 09:00.460
I'll go talk
to Xander now.

09:00.460 --> 09:03.540
Good work, Miss Blue.
That's your code name.

09:03.540 --> 09:06.170
Can I be Miss Magenta?
Blue's not my best color.

09:08.210 --> 09:11.290
You've only been a spy
for a day, and you're
already being difficult.

09:12.880 --> 09:14.000
Bush out.

09:20.170 --> 09:22.790
Oh. (IN BRITISH ACCENT)
Hello, Emma.

09:22.790 --> 09:24.710
How lovely to see you.

09:24.710 --> 09:28.170
Do you have the
information I requested?

09:28.170 --> 09:30.380
Why are you talking
like the guy who cleans
our chimneys?

09:31.330 --> 09:33.000
It's my spy accent.

09:33.000 --> 09:35.750
The name's McCormick.
Xander McCormick.

09:35.750 --> 09:39.210
Well, that's annoying.
Very annoying.

09:39.210 --> 09:41.500
(NORMAL) Hey, did you find out
about the Woodchuck's
race car?

09:41.500 --> 09:43.000
Yes.

09:43.000 --> 09:45.420
Lou's using the big fan
from the mess hall
to power it.

09:45.420 --> 09:47.210
Thanks.

09:47.210 --> 09:50.330
So... How are you guys
going to power your car?

09:50.330 --> 09:53.120
Ravi is building us a
water-powered steam engine.

09:53.120 --> 09:56.210
We were gonna go with gas,
but Jorge's a sporadic farter.

09:56.210 --> 09:58.620
He's disgusting,
but undependable.

09:59.500 --> 10:00.620
Cheerio!

10:05.750 --> 10:09.580
Okay, you have 20 minutes
to prep your cars
for the derby.

10:09.580 --> 10:11.210
I have to go
buy a ski mask.

10:11.210 --> 10:15.170
Carl says covering up my face
really brings out my eyes.

10:16.380 --> 10:17.620
Psst! Emma!

10:20.170 --> 10:21.170
(IN RUSSIAN ACCENT)
Good to see you.

10:21.170 --> 10:24.710
Your intel proved
very, very valuable.

10:24.710 --> 10:27.120
So now
you're a vampire?

10:27.120 --> 10:30.420
No, I am Russian spy!

10:30.420 --> 10:32.170
Thank you for your
help, comrade.

10:32.170 --> 10:35.710
No problem.
It's not stressing me
out at all. (CHUCKLES)

10:39.170 --> 10:40.920
Little tip.

10:40.920 --> 10:44.330
Someone reversed
direction of blades
on Lou's fan. (CHUCKLES)

10:44.330 --> 10:46.420
Prepare to be
"blown away."

10:46.420 --> 10:48.120
(CHUCKLES)
Do svidanya.

10:52.330 --> 10:56.000
The cheese on
the pizza is melting.

10:56.000 --> 10:58.170
Okay, what else would
the cheese be doing?

10:58.170 --> 11:00.750
That's code for I filled
the Grizzlies' tank

11:00.750 --> 11:04.120
with toxic lake water
to destroy the engine.

11:04.120 --> 11:06.170
I would not
have guessed that.

11:06.170 --> 11:08.290
That's why it's code.
(CHUCKLES)

11:08.290 --> 11:09.250
(WHISPERS)
You never saw me.

11:12.460 --> 11:13.750
Hello, Jorge.

11:15.210 --> 11:18.330
Ravi, I'm supposed
to be the mascot!

11:18.330 --> 11:22.080
Your tacky bear costume
inspired me to get
one of my own,

11:22.080 --> 11:25.330
so we can actually
get those bonus points.

11:25.330 --> 11:28.750
(IN DEEP VOICE) Hey!
I'm beary offended!

11:28.750 --> 11:33.500
Well, Beary, my mascot
is a true representation
of the grizzly species,

11:33.500 --> 11:35.580
so you can suck an egg.

11:35.580 --> 11:37.380
Hey, check this out.

11:37.380 --> 11:39.960
(LAUGHS)
What the heck
is that?

11:39.960 --> 11:42.380
It's our two-faced
woodchuck mascot.

11:42.380 --> 11:46.210
So neither of us
have to do booty duty.

11:46.210 --> 11:50.120
There's no way your
lame giant rat costume
is gonna beat us!

11:50.120 --> 11:51.540
True dat!

11:51.540 --> 11:53.960
So I am taking the egg
I was going to have
Jorge suck on,

11:53.960 --> 11:56.750
and offering it to you.

11:56.750 --> 12:01.880
Well, we do not
egg-cept your egg.
(CHUCKLES)

12:01.880 --> 12:04.460
See what I did there?

12:04.460 --> 12:08.790
Very well, Woodchucks,
it is on like a stream
full of sal-mon! (CHUCKLES)

12:08.790 --> 12:10.500
(ROARING)

12:12.580 --> 12:14.080
(SCREAMS) Bear!

12:15.040 --> 12:16.290
RAVI: Ow!

12:19.170 --> 12:21.920
Oops!
It was self-defense.

12:21.920 --> 12:23.120
...Is what
I'll say in court.

12:25.830 --> 12:27.250
This is great!

12:27.250 --> 12:30.920
With Ravi down,
we got this mascot thing
in the bag.

12:30.920 --> 12:34.040
I don't know.
Crystal's gonna be
hard to beat.

12:35.580 --> 12:37.040
Man, she's good.

12:41.080 --> 12:43.210
It's time for the race!

12:43.210 --> 12:45.040
(ALL CHEERING)

12:48.290 --> 12:50.420
Drivers,
start your engines!

12:50.420 --> 12:53.460
Or whatever you've got
going on in there.

12:53.460 --> 12:55.710
Hey, Xander,
nice car.

12:55.710 --> 12:59.420
Too bad the only thing
that will be steaming is you,
when you lose!

12:59.420 --> 13:01.250
Boom!

13:01.250 --> 13:04.290
You're sounding real confident
for someone who's about to
blow it!

13:04.290 --> 13:05.460
Boom back at ya.

13:06.880 --> 13:10.210
Ready, set... Go!

13:10.210 --> 13:11.790
See ya, suckers!

13:15.120 --> 13:17.040
What the heck happened
to our engine?

13:17.040 --> 13:21.250
I don't know, but it's
beary disappointing!

13:21.250 --> 13:23.790
Is there a cheer
for when your team
loses horribly?

13:23.790 --> 13:25.710
Yeah. It's "boo!"

13:26.750 --> 13:30.000
And the Weasel car wins!
(CHEERING)

13:30.000 --> 13:33.290
It's all tied up
going into the last event!

13:33.290 --> 13:36.210
(CRASHING)

13:36.210 --> 13:40.670
Ooh, Hazel, looks like
your camper just high-fived
that tree with her face.

13:40.670 --> 13:42.250
That's fine.
I've got others.

13:44.330 --> 13:45.120
Oh!

13:46.210 --> 13:47.500
Did we win?

13:53.710 --> 13:56.040
(SCREAMS)
Shh!

13:56.040 --> 13:58.040
You are attracting
attention!

13:58.040 --> 14:00.540
Says the human
fruit bowl!

14:00.540 --> 14:02.290
Listen, I've got to
beat Xander,

14:02.290 --> 14:05.380
and the camp spirit
performance is my last chance!

14:05.380 --> 14:06.920
Your new mission
is to find out

14:06.920 --> 14:09.170
what the Grizzlies
are doing for their act.

14:09.170 --> 14:10.620
But I don't
wanna do that!

14:10.620 --> 14:13.620
Which we all know is code for,
"Whatever you say, Lou."

14:14.790 --> 14:17.170
I am depending on you,
Miss Magenta.

14:17.710 --> 14:18.960
Now I vanish.

14:21.750 --> 14:23.710
(IN FRENCH ACCENT)
Bonsoir, mademoiselle.

14:26.380 --> 14:28.250
I am in need
of intelligence.

14:28.250 --> 14:31.000
You certainly are.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.710
Now drop the stupid accent
and tell me what you want.

14:33.710 --> 14:36.920
Well, excuse-moi.

14:36.920 --> 14:40.250
(NORMAL) Look, I need to
know what the Woodchucks'
spirit performance is.

14:40.250 --> 14:42.380
Ugh, of course you do.
But we don't know
what it is yet!

14:42.380 --> 14:45.080
Well, as soon as you decide,
leave a note with the info
under my pillow.

14:45.080 --> 14:48.830
Okay, fine! Why not?
You can count on
Miss Magenta!

14:48.830 --> 14:51.170
Who's Miss Magenta?
I don't know anymore!

14:54.380 --> 14:56.250
LOU: Back off,
Weasel face!

14:56.250 --> 14:57.290
Bring it,
fruit bowl!

14:59.170 --> 15:00.380
That's what I thought.

15:08.290 --> 15:11.540
Ew! Hazel,
what are you doing?

15:11.540 --> 15:14.540
Not rubbing my scent
all over Xander's pillow,
so he'll dream of me.

15:14.540 --> 15:16.290
(CHUCKLES NERVOUSLY)

15:16.290 --> 15:18.710
Wait a minute,
what are you doing here?

15:18.710 --> 15:23.830
Uh... Dropping off a belated
Happy Groundhog Day card.

15:24.620 --> 15:25.830
Uh-huh.

15:25.830 --> 15:27.250
Give me that!
(CHUCKLES)

15:27.250 --> 15:28.460
(GASPS)

15:29.170 --> 15:30.830
You're a spy!

15:30.830 --> 15:32.500
What makes you say that?

15:32.500 --> 15:36.210
This note that says,
"Emma's top secret
spy info."

15:38.830 --> 15:41.290
This is your cabin's
performance plan!

15:41.290 --> 15:44.750
You're ratting on your own
cabin for your boyfriend's
cabin.

15:44.750 --> 15:47.330
To be fair, I'm also
ratting on the Grizzlies
for the Woodchucks.

15:47.330 --> 15:49.540
(GASPS)
Probably shouldn't
have told you that.

15:50.250 --> 15:52.500
So you're a double agent!

15:52.500 --> 15:58.750
Well, well, well, look at
Miss Goody-Two-Summer-Homes.

15:58.750 --> 16:02.580
It'd be a shame
if someone told your
boyfriend and your bestie

16:02.580 --> 16:04.670
that you were playing
both of them.

16:04.670 --> 16:06.250
(GASPS)
Who would do that?

16:07.210 --> 16:09.670
Doy, me!

16:09.670 --> 16:12.880
But you know what, Emma?
I'll keep your little secret,

16:12.880 --> 16:14.880
if you tell me
what the Woodchucks
and Grizzlies

16:14.880 --> 16:17.000
are planning
for their performances.

16:17.000 --> 16:19.170
Spy for the Weasels?

16:19.170 --> 16:21.120
I would rather
wear corduroy.

16:21.120 --> 16:24.380
(GAGS) It's even
gross to say!

16:24.380 --> 16:27.540
All right,
but Lou and Xander
will be so hurt

16:27.540 --> 16:29.540
when they find out
you betrayed them...

16:29.540 --> 16:31.460
Okay, okay.

16:31.460 --> 16:33.710
The Woodchucks are dressing up
like Gladys and dancing.

16:33.710 --> 16:36.790
And the Grizzlies
are doing an EDM remix
of the Kikiwaka song.

16:37.420 --> 16:39.040
Thank you, Emma.

16:39.040 --> 16:41.710
You just handed
the Weasels
Cabin of the Year.

16:41.710 --> 16:43.380
(LAUGHS EVILLY)

16:43.380 --> 16:47.000
By the way,
whatever you're doing
with your hair, keep it up.

16:47.000 --> 16:48.040
You look awful.

16:54.460 --> 16:58.210
Hey, the spirit performances
are about to start.

16:58.210 --> 17:02.750
You dumb-chucks
don't stand a chance
against Bear Force One!

17:04.250 --> 17:07.380
RAVI: Good one, bear bro!
Slap me some paw.

17:10.170 --> 17:12.710
I was so close
to a cool exit.

17:18.040 --> 17:21.250
Okay, we have got to beat
those salmon-sucking jerks!

17:21.250 --> 17:26.750
Yeah, maybe we should go the
more traditional one-headed
route with our costume.

17:26.750 --> 17:29.380
Rock, paper, scissors
to see who gets to be
the Woodchuck head?

17:29.380 --> 17:30.710
Deal.

17:30.710 --> 17:32.250
BOTH: Rock, paper,
scissors, shoot!

17:32.250 --> 17:35.330
(GASPS) Paper covers rock!
Ha! I win!

17:35.330 --> 17:39.290
That's not a rock.
This is a rock.

17:39.290 --> 17:41.670
A diamond?
And it's all yours.

17:41.670 --> 17:44.080
(GASPS) Correction.
You win. (CHUCKLES)

17:46.290 --> 17:49.540
Take your seats
for the performance!

17:49.540 --> 17:50.960
Our finalists are tied,

17:50.960 --> 17:54.830
so whoever wins this,
wins the coveted golden canoe,

17:54.830 --> 17:57.250
and Cabin of the Year!

17:57.250 --> 17:58.880
(ALL CHEERING)
Quiet!

18:01.040 --> 18:03.170
I'm sorry, I'm not
as bubbly as usual.

18:03.170 --> 18:06.880
(CHUCKLES) I was up all night
playing Hide and Seek
with Carl.

18:07.670 --> 18:09.250
I never did find him.

18:11.120 --> 18:13.290
And something tells me
she never will.

18:13.290 --> 18:16.460
Just like you'll never beat me
for Cabin of the Year.

18:16.460 --> 18:20.380
Think again!
We've got this in the bag.

18:20.380 --> 18:21.710
Right, Emma?

18:21.710 --> 18:23.790
Guys, maybe
neither of us will win.

18:23.790 --> 18:25.540
The Weasels might take
the whole thing.

18:25.540 --> 18:27.040
C'est la vie.

18:27.040 --> 18:29.040
Oh, so you can do
the French thing,
and I can't?

18:30.210 --> 18:31.790
Woodchuck walking!

18:33.000 --> 18:35.170
RAVI:
Oh, look who it is.

18:35.170 --> 18:38.750
You two really
put the "uck"
in Woodchuck.

18:38.750 --> 18:43.460
Well, you guys are about to
get em-bear-rassed.

18:43.460 --> 18:45.880
TIFFANY:
Ooh, nice bear-slam!

18:47.750 --> 18:51.620
Stand back and watch the bros
rack up the points!

18:51.620 --> 18:54.670
Oh, you just rump-bumped
the wrong Chucks!

18:54.670 --> 18:56.330
Tiffany, back
that thang up!

18:57.040 --> 18:58.380
RAVI: Oh.

18:58.380 --> 19:00.170
I cannot see!

19:00.170 --> 19:02.330
Hey! Watch
where you're going!

19:03.750 --> 19:06.170
Stop hitting yourself!
Stop hitting yourself!

19:06.170 --> 19:07.500
Guys, quit it!

19:07.500 --> 19:09.420
Why can't you be
more like Crystal?

19:11.210 --> 19:14.040
Okay, I guess
we should start.

19:14.040 --> 19:18.210
Let's welcome our first
performers, the Weasels.

19:18.210 --> 19:19.750
(ALL CHEERING)

19:19.750 --> 19:21.830
(DANCE MUSIC PLAYING)

19:21.830 --> 19:27.880
Yo, yo, you guys wanna
hear a Camp Kikiwaka
EDM remix?

19:27.880 --> 19:30.250
Wait, that's what
we were going to do!

19:31.420 --> 19:35.250
And we're the
dancing Gladyses!

19:37.170 --> 19:40.040
Hey, that's what
we were going to do!

19:43.670 --> 19:45.380
What are you doing?
Get off the stage!

19:45.380 --> 19:46.620
(ALL ARGUING)

19:50.250 --> 19:52.120
(WHISTLES)

19:52.120 --> 19:53.620
What's going on here?

19:53.620 --> 19:55.710
Hazel stole our act!
And ours, too!

19:55.710 --> 19:58.500
They're lying!
They're the ones who've been
cheating this whole time!

19:58.500 --> 20:01.460
Well, somebody
better fess up!
And make it fast.

20:01.460 --> 20:06.580
I'm hoping Carl
got tired of hiding and
wants to start seeking.

20:06.580 --> 20:09.580
Look, the Grizzlies
didn't do anything
wrong, okay?

20:09.580 --> 20:12.170
Hazel obviously
spied on us.
And us.

20:12.170 --> 20:14.170
The Woodchucks
are innocent
in all of this!

20:14.170 --> 20:16.880
Innocent,
I tell you.

20:16.880 --> 20:20.540
That's it!
I am so sick
of all the lying!

20:20.540 --> 20:22.210
You want the truth?
No!

20:23.880 --> 20:25.210
Lou made me
spy on Xander,

20:25.210 --> 20:26.250
then Xander made me
spy on Lou,

20:26.250 --> 20:27.880
then Hazel
made me spy on
both of them!

20:28.710 --> 20:30.000
You betrayed me?

20:30.000 --> 20:32.330
And me?
How could you?

20:32.330 --> 20:34.000
How could you?

20:34.000 --> 20:37.330
This game is supposed
to be about friendship
and working together,

20:37.330 --> 20:40.080
not stabbing each other
in the back!

20:40.080 --> 20:42.750
And look at what
being your puppet
has done to me!

20:42.750 --> 20:44.880
I'm a nine now!
A nine!

20:46.120 --> 20:47.500
Emma, wait!

20:49.290 --> 20:53.330
Wow, some people
are way too competitive.

20:53.330 --> 20:54.580
Where were we?

20:54.580 --> 20:56.750
RAVI: You were beating me
with my own appendage.

20:56.750 --> 21:00.290
Right.
Stop hitting yourself.
Stop hitting yourself.

21:00.290 --> 21:02.210
(SIGHS)

21:02.210 --> 21:04.290
Knock, knock.
Who's there?

21:04.290 --> 21:06.120
BOTH: Xander and Lou,

21:06.120 --> 21:09.880
and they're really sorry
for what they did to you.

21:11.210 --> 21:12.670
Go away.

21:12.670 --> 21:15.500
Okay, that wasn't worth
all that practice.

21:15.500 --> 21:18.500
Emma, we feel really bad
for what we did.

21:18.500 --> 21:21.170
Maybe we are
a little competitive.

21:21.170 --> 21:24.710
A little? That's like saying
I own a "little" island
in the Caribbean.

21:26.250 --> 21:28.540
I guess we did
get carried away.

21:28.540 --> 21:30.830
I just really wanted
that golden canoe.

21:30.830 --> 21:33.330
And I just really wanted
Xander to lose.

21:34.620 --> 21:37.080
(SIGHS) Look,
it's my fault, too.

21:37.080 --> 21:39.250
I shouldn't let people
walk all over me.

21:39.250 --> 21:42.170
And what I've learnt here
is I need to be stronger,
and just say no.

21:43.420 --> 21:46.250
So what you're
saying is...

21:46.250 --> 21:50.380
By being terrible friends,
we helped you become
a better person?

21:50.380 --> 21:53.290
(CHUCKLES) Wow,
we are such great
counselors!

21:53.290 --> 21:55.120
Well, me maybe
a little more than you.

21:55.830 --> 21:57.210
XANDER: Oh, yeah?

21:57.210 --> 21:59.040
How about
a little competition?
Emma, will you judge?

21:59.040 --> 22:00.170
No!

22:00.170 --> 22:04.380
Ooh, that felt good.
Ask me something else.

22:04.380 --> 22:08.710
So, since everyone cheated
at the Cabin of the Year
competition,

22:08.710 --> 22:12.290
I have no choice
but to disqualify
all of you!

22:12.290 --> 22:14.040
(ALL GROAN)

22:14.040 --> 22:15.960
This is all
your fault, Emma!

22:15.960 --> 22:20.120
You couldn't keep your
perfectly symmetrical
mouth shut!

22:20.120 --> 22:22.380
And I'm keeping
the golden canoe
for myself.

22:22.380 --> 22:25.580
That's at least ten minutes
of fun at the roulette table.

22:25.580 --> 22:28.750
I need some cheering up,
since Carl dumped me.

22:28.750 --> 22:31.830
What?
That is cray cray.

22:31.830 --> 22:33.290
Yeah.

22:33.290 --> 22:36.790
Aside from not wanting
to be around you,
or see your face,

22:36.790 --> 22:39.250
I thought he was
totally into you.

22:40.210 --> 22:42.120
Me too, kid.

22:42.120 --> 22:45.210
But there's always
the pizza guy.
(CHUCKLES)

22:45.210 --> 22:47.210
That reminds me,
I need to buy duct tape.

22:48.170 --> 22:49.460
RAVI: Hello.

22:49.460 --> 22:51.290
Guys, the competition
is over.

22:51.290 --> 22:53.460
Yeah, you don't have to wear
those costumes anymore.

22:53.460 --> 22:57.330
I sweated so much,
my costume fused to my skin.

22:59.250 --> 23:00.580
And I just like mine.

23:00.580 --> 23:03.330
I get to pretend
I have chest hair.

23:03.330 --> 23:05.290
I forgot
my buffet card.

23:05.290 --> 23:06.380
(SCREAMS)

23:07.210 --> 23:08.500
(GASPS)

23:10.500 --> 23:12.880
Gladys, that's Ravi,
not a bear!

23:12.880 --> 23:13.880
I know.
