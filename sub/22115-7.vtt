00:02.303 --> 00:03.504
Hi, I'm Jeffrey Tanner.

00:03.537 --> 00:05.339
Welcome to Sophe.

00:05.373 --> 00:08.042
We all know the Internet
changed the world.

00:08.076 --> 00:10.244
The only question is:
into what?

00:10.278 --> 00:11.545
It can be a platform
to bring us together

00:11.579 --> 00:13.147
or to tear us apart.

00:13.181 --> 00:14.448
I know, because I spent my life

00:14.482 --> 00:16.350
trying to turn it
into something

00:16.384 --> 00:18.486
that would connect us all.
Then...

00:18.519 --> 00:20.488
I love you, Dad.
...my daughter was murdered.

00:20.521 --> 00:22.423
Nothing else mattered anymore.

00:22.456 --> 00:24.458
Everyone was sure
they knew who did it--

00:24.492 --> 00:26.460
the police, my ex-wife--

00:26.494 --> 00:28.196
but I was convinced the
wrong man had been convicted

00:28.229 --> 00:30.231
and the real killer
was still out there.

00:30.264 --> 00:32.200
So together with my team,
I built Sophe,

00:32.233 --> 00:34.435
a crowdsource
crime solving platform

00:34.468 --> 00:37.471
powered by the smartest,
most diverse,

00:37.505 --> 00:40.374
independent collection of
detectives on the planet:

00:40.408 --> 00:42.576
you.

00:42.610 --> 00:45.146
Let's get to work.

00:45.179 --> 00:46.547
Previously on
Wisdom of the Crowd...

00:46.580 --> 00:48.416
Nell DeGraf sent
a cease-and-desist,

00:48.449 --> 00:50.151
claiming Sophe's running code

00:50.184 --> 00:51.585
stolen from AllSourcer.

00:51.619 --> 00:54.422
That is my code, not theirs.

00:54.455 --> 00:56.590
That all originated
from my grad work at Stanford.

00:56.624 --> 00:58.359
Then it's not really
about the code anymore.

00:58.392 --> 00:59.493
They're coming after you.

00:59.527 --> 01:01.295
At least, what's
in your head.

01:01.329 --> 01:02.430
Sophe. It closes cases.

01:02.463 --> 01:04.132
I want people
to know

01:04.165 --> 01:07.168
that SFPD is working with
Sophe on a regular basis.

01:07.201 --> 01:09.303
Tell him I might know
who killed Mia Tanner.

01:09.337 --> 01:10.604
CAVANAUGH: Carlos Ochoa
was attacked in prison.

01:10.638 --> 01:12.473
He was stabbed.

01:12.506 --> 01:14.275
TANNER:
Ochoa left a message.

01:14.308 --> 01:16.510
Said that he might
know something after all.

01:16.544 --> 01:19.113
What if that's why someone
was trying to kill him?

01:19.147 --> 01:20.248
You're talking about
a cover-up

01:20.281 --> 01:21.549
around your
daughter's murder?

01:21.582 --> 01:23.351
What if there is?

01:26.220 --> 01:28.256
You're sure that there's,
there's nothing else?

01:28.289 --> 01:30.391
I already told you everything
I know, Mr. Tanner.

01:30.424 --> 01:32.193
Yeah, no,
I know.

01:32.226 --> 01:33.661
I just want to go over it,
you know, again.

01:33.694 --> 01:35.429
Maybe, you know,
there's some small detail

01:35.463 --> 01:36.597
that you forgot.
I wish that there were.

01:36.630 --> 01:38.566
Carlos Ochoa called my office.

01:38.599 --> 01:40.201
He left a message,
trying to get ahold of you,

01:40.234 --> 01:41.535
saying he might have
some new information

01:41.569 --> 01:43.137
about who killed
your daughter.

01:43.171 --> 01:45.173
But by the time
the information got to me,

01:45.206 --> 01:46.340
it was too late.
He was already attacked.

01:46.374 --> 01:47.608
Can you hold this?

01:47.641 --> 01:48.609
So...

01:48.642 --> 01:50.544
you don't have any idea

01:50.578 --> 01:51.679
who he was referring to?

01:51.712 --> 01:53.214
No, I don't.

01:53.247 --> 01:54.515
And to be honest with you,

01:54.548 --> 01:56.517
I get messages
like this every day

01:56.550 --> 01:58.219
from clients in prison,

01:58.252 --> 02:00.454
with a new story about
who really did it.

02:00.488 --> 02:01.622
You want my advice?

02:01.655 --> 02:02.623
Move on.

02:02.656 --> 02:04.225
There's nothing there.

02:04.258 --> 02:05.693
No, of course
there's something there,

02:05.726 --> 02:07.461
because all I need is a lead,
any kind of a lead,

02:07.495 --> 02:09.363
and listen to me,
I could find that guy...
Shh.

02:09.397 --> 02:11.199
Look, this... if there
even is a guy, all right?

02:11.232 --> 02:12.633
I don't mean to be rude,
but if you wanted to help,

02:12.666 --> 02:14.268
the time to help
was during the trial.

02:14.302 --> 02:15.769
Right now, we don't even know

02:15.803 --> 02:17.171
if Carlos Ochoa's ever going
to wake up again.

02:17.205 --> 02:19.240
I gotta go,
that's my client.

02:19.273 --> 02:20.674
Your Honor. Louis Hines from
the public defender's office,

02:20.708 --> 02:21.675
for the defendant.

02:21.709 --> 02:23.177
Sorry I'm late.

02:23.211 --> 02:25.413
(continues indistinctly)

02:35.356 --> 02:37.525
FOREWOMAN:
We, the jury,

02:37.558 --> 02:40.428
in the matter of The State
of California v. Carlos Ochoa,

02:40.461 --> 02:42.696
on the charge of murder
in the first degree,

02:42.730 --> 02:45.165
find the defendant guilty.

02:46.767 --> 02:48.269
HINES:
I apologize

02:48.302 --> 02:49.270
for being late.

02:49.303 --> 02:50.804
Do not let it reflect.

02:50.838 --> 02:53.374
He has no choice
in counsel.

02:53.407 --> 02:54.675
It's not his fault.

02:54.708 --> 02:56.344
You're looking well.

03:00.448 --> 03:02.650
(sizzling)

03:02.683 --> 03:04.452
(smoke alarm beeping loudly)

03:04.485 --> 03:05.519
Jordan.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.221
Jordan!

03:07.255 --> 03:09.357
What the hell
are you doing?

03:09.390 --> 03:10.324
Whoa!

03:10.358 --> 03:11.592
Dad, no!

03:14.762 --> 03:16.764
Dude. Uncool.

03:16.797 --> 03:18.299
Where the hell
did you get a blowtorch?

03:19.400 --> 03:19.433
At the hardware store,
right next to the Whole Foods.

03:19.733 --> 03:21.235
Man...

03:21.269 --> 03:22.570
Well, there goes 60 bucks' worth

03:22.603 --> 03:24.438
of grass-fed rib eye.

03:24.472 --> 03:26.540
60 bucks...
Haven't you ever
heard of sous vide?

03:26.574 --> 03:28.842
No, but I've
heard of Domino's.

03:28.876 --> 03:30.578
Are you being
serious right now?

03:30.611 --> 03:33.647
You are your mother's son,
I'll tell you that much.

03:33.681 --> 03:36.350
People say cops
are married to their jobs.

03:36.384 --> 03:38.419
(line ringing)
They should meet
a chef sometime.

03:38.452 --> 03:40.721
Yeah. Hey, can I get,
uh, two large pies,

03:40.754 --> 03:42.723
extra cheese, pepperoni?

03:42.756 --> 03:44.792
Yeah, I'll hold.
Why two?

03:44.825 --> 03:46.460
What? Breakfast.

03:46.494 --> 03:48.629
Ain't trying
to burn up the place.

03:48.662 --> 03:49.830
(evidence alert beeping)
Yeah. Yeah, man, um...

03:49.863 --> 03:51.765
What the hell?

03:51.799 --> 03:53.434
Ooh, Sophe.

03:53.467 --> 03:54.768
Oh, please,
it's not like that.

03:59.373 --> 04:01.842
Hey, uh, cancel
that order. Thanks.

04:01.875 --> 04:03.577
I'll tell you in
the car. Let's go.

04:03.611 --> 04:04.612
Where we going?

04:04.645 --> 04:06.547
Yo, grab a jacket.

04:07.648 --> 04:09.883
RUIZ:
What do you got?

04:09.917 --> 04:12.320
Vic's name is Edward Ramirez,
he's the owner.

04:12.353 --> 04:13.754
Looks like a robbery gone bad.

04:15.856 --> 04:17.558
What about the
surveillance system?

04:17.591 --> 04:18.626
Guy took it out.

04:23.797 --> 04:25.766
Stay in the car.

04:25.799 --> 04:27.368
I'll be right back.

04:27.401 --> 04:28.702
If anybody asks
what you're doing,

04:28.736 --> 04:29.870
you tell 'em you're my son.
Dad...

04:29.903 --> 04:31.905
I'm 15.
I can take care of myself.

04:31.939 --> 04:33.341
Yeah, just stay
in the car.

04:33.374 --> 04:35.376
All right?
Thank you.

04:35.409 --> 04:37.545
Cavanaugh. Thanks.

04:41.515 --> 04:44.518
What, you don't have
enough cases on your desk?

04:44.552 --> 04:45.519
Special delivery.

04:45.553 --> 04:46.720
And I'm not staying.

04:46.754 --> 04:48.589
Guess who has a suspect
for your murder.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.824
What murder?

04:50.858 --> 04:52.292
What... this murder?

04:55.363 --> 04:57.798
Tommy, this has been a crime
scene for all of three hours.

04:57.831 --> 04:59.433
We haven't even
put out a statement yet.

04:59.467 --> 05:00.601
(evidence alert beeping)
Annoying, isn't it?

05:00.634 --> 05:03.471
Hey, Houston-- you read me?

05:03.504 --> 05:05.373
Loud and clear, Detective.
But the situation's changed.

05:05.406 --> 05:06.674
Changed how?

05:06.707 --> 05:07.808
I just talked to you
five minutes ago.

05:07.841 --> 05:09.777
Once users put this photo up,

05:09.810 --> 05:11.679
people started recognizing
this guy and posting more.

05:11.712 --> 05:12.680
What do you mean,
users putting it out?

05:12.713 --> 05:13.781
You guys aren't doing this?

05:13.814 --> 05:14.915
No, that's the thing--

05:14.948 --> 05:16.517
we didn't do anything here.

05:16.550 --> 05:18.352
The users found this one
on their own.

05:18.386 --> 05:19.687
They've been scanning
police bands,

05:19.720 --> 05:21.422
following local crimes.
(sniffs)

05:21.455 --> 05:22.923
We always knew,
once the crowd got motivated,

05:22.956 --> 05:24.658
they'd start solving cases
on their own.

05:24.692 --> 05:26.460
They pulled the image
from a weather camera

05:27.761 --> 05:27.795
across the street,
but the crazy thing isn't...
(Josh blows nose)

05:28.662 --> 05:30.364
...how they did it,
it's who they found.

05:35.436 --> 05:37.671
Jack Foley?
Wasn't he part
of the group

05:37.705 --> 05:39.540
that blew up the government
building in Kansas?

05:39.573 --> 05:41.442
TARIQ:
Yeah.

05:41.475 --> 05:43.711
The others were all sent
to federal prison in '98.

05:43.744 --> 05:44.812
CAVANAUGH:
Sovereign Destiny--

05:44.845 --> 05:47.781
that was the name of 'em, right?

05:47.815 --> 05:49.850
Some anti-government wackos?

05:49.883 --> 05:51.652
TARIQ:
Foley was their money guy.

05:51.685 --> 05:53.587
After the bombing,
he disappeared

05:53.621 --> 05:54.855
and feds thought he was killed
to protect the operation.

05:54.888 --> 05:56.590
Hey, Mom.
(on phone): Was it great?

05:56.624 --> 05:58.892
No, the, uh,
steak didn't really work well.

06:00.528 --> 06:01.729
Nothing.

06:01.762 --> 06:03.731
Just watching a dead body go by.

06:03.764 --> 06:04.865
What?

06:04.898 --> 06:06.534
Dad brought me to work.

06:06.567 --> 06:08.736
What? Where is he?
Put him on the phone!

06:08.769 --> 06:10.471
If you get anything else,
send it to me.

06:10.504 --> 06:12.473
On it. Thanks.

06:12.506 --> 06:14.742
I'm gonna call the
deputy chief and tell her

06:14.775 --> 06:17.010
we've got a domestic terrorist
loose in San Francisco.

06:17.044 --> 06:18.779
Yeah. Well, I get
to tell my son

06:18.812 --> 06:20.514
that tomorrow's
"bring your kid to work day."

06:20.548 --> 06:22.516
Uh...

06:22.550 --> 06:24.452
what part of "stay in the car"
didn't you understand?

06:24.485 --> 06:25.619
Mom wants to talk to you.

06:25.653 --> 06:27.888
Put him on the phone.

06:27.921 --> 06:28.889
Hello?

06:28.922 --> 06:30.491
Tommy, are you there?

06:30.524 --> 06:31.825
Tommy...

06:31.859 --> 06:33.494
Hey, what's going on, girl?

06:33.527 --> 06:35.463
*

06:37.598 --> 06:38.699
Good morning.

06:38.732 --> 06:39.733
There's been a development

06:39.767 --> 06:40.734
in the AllSourcer suit,

06:40.768 --> 06:42.636
and it's not good.

06:42.670 --> 06:44.037
What, Nell DeGraf wants
two pounds of flesh now?

06:44.071 --> 06:46.907
AllSourcer has filed
a preliminary injunction,

06:46.940 --> 06:48.776
prohibiting Sara
from working here.

06:48.809 --> 06:49.910
Basically, they're saying

06:49.943 --> 06:51.044
that you're
a walking trade secret,

06:51.078 --> 06:52.680
that you belong to them.

06:52.713 --> 06:54.915
Now, we're gonna have
a chance to state our case

06:54.948 --> 06:56.650
and I still think we can
get around this, so...

06:56.684 --> 06:59.520
Good. Then what seems
to be the problem?

06:59.553 --> 07:01.789
The problem is, the
judge issued a TRO.

07:03.957 --> 07:05.659
MIKE: That's a temporary
restraining order...

07:05.693 --> 07:07.961
Yes, I... I've seen Law & Order.

07:07.995 --> 07:11.599
It means that you
have to stop work.

07:11.632 --> 07:14.568
Basically now.

07:14.602 --> 07:17.538
SARA: But I thought
you said these lawsuits

07:17.571 --> 07:18.939
were frivolous.

07:18.972 --> 07:20.040
They were meant
to cost us money.

07:20.073 --> 07:22.009
I-I've been through this
a million times,

07:22.042 --> 07:23.811
and i-it's just, it's all
part of the process.

07:23.844 --> 07:24.978
MIKE:
It's only temporary.

07:25.012 --> 07:26.980
A few days, a week at the most.

07:27.014 --> 07:29.683
But until then,
counsel has stated

07:29.717 --> 07:30.851
that the smart thing
to do here

07:30.884 --> 07:34.488
is for you to go home,

07:34.522 --> 07:35.823
effective immediately.

07:35.856 --> 07:37.591
You're joking.

07:37.625 --> 07:40.628
I'm afraid not.

07:40.661 --> 07:42.095
AllSourcer will have private
investigators following you.

07:42.129 --> 07:44.598
And any contact,

07:44.632 --> 07:45.999
and they're gonna sell it
as a violation of the TRO.

07:46.033 --> 07:47.568
It's poisoning the well.

07:47.601 --> 07:48.836
Any contact?

07:48.869 --> 07:50.103
Yes.

07:50.137 --> 07:52.906
Online, personal,
physical...

07:52.940 --> 07:54.842
anything.

07:54.875 --> 07:56.910
All right? That includes
any covert communications

07:56.944 --> 07:58.579
or technical
workarounds.

07:58.612 --> 07:59.880
They will subpoena
our server logs, so...

07:59.913 --> 08:01.081
In other words,
play by the rules,

08:01.114 --> 08:02.583
while our opponent cheats.

08:02.616 --> 08:03.851
Why not?

08:03.884 --> 08:04.885
If you do need to communicate,

08:04.918 --> 08:06.620
you do it through me.

08:06.654 --> 08:07.855
All right?
I'm an officer of the court.

08:07.888 --> 08:09.557
The judge did agree to that.

08:09.590 --> 08:11.124
TANNER:
Delightful.

08:11.158 --> 08:12.593
But, Sara,

08:12.626 --> 08:13.861
for now...

08:13.894 --> 08:15.729
you need to leave.

08:17.565 --> 08:17.998
Right.

08:19.800 --> 08:21.769
Well...

08:22.870 --> 08:24.538
All right, then.

08:24.572 --> 08:25.105
Um...

08:34.815 --> 08:36.750
Tell the boys I'll be okay.

08:36.784 --> 08:38.051
I promise.

08:38.085 --> 08:39.853
(door opens)

08:39.887 --> 08:41.855
Jeffrey,
she's gotta go.

08:50.163 --> 08:52.966
*

09:04.812 --> 09:06.614
What do you mean, she went home?

09:06.647 --> 09:08.616
It's just a precaution.
For the lawyers.

09:08.649 --> 09:10.017
Yeah, but we need her here
to help.

09:10.050 --> 09:10.984
We can't...
Don't worry about it.

09:11.819 --> 09:12.953
Where-- where are we
with Jack Foley?

09:13.954 --> 09:14.922
Domestic terrorist on the loose?
People panic.

09:15.989 --> 09:16.757
Submissions are coming in
from all over the place.

09:17.691 --> 09:18.792
The public forums
are on fire...
Forum?

09:19.593 --> 09:20.260
Why isn't it on
the main platform?

09:20.293 --> 09:22.129
We opened up a case, didn't we?

09:22.162 --> 09:24.131
We did, but only after
the users ID'd him.

09:24.164 --> 09:26.033
They feel a sense of ownership,

09:26.066 --> 09:28.035
so they keep using
the public channels. Here, look.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.971
Foley's lived in nine
different cities since 1998,

09:31.004 --> 09:32.740
under 11 different
pseudonyms.

09:32.773 --> 09:34.074
(blows nose)

09:34.107 --> 09:36.610
A bunch of users
recognized his mug shot,

09:36.644 --> 09:37.978
but they all say they knew
him by a different name.

09:38.011 --> 09:39.947
TARIQ: And he's
been busy.

09:39.980 --> 09:41.682
Embezzlement schemes
in Utah and Texas.

09:41.715 --> 09:43.216
Tax fraud in Florida.

09:43.250 --> 09:44.985
And in Poulsbo, Washington,

09:45.018 --> 09:46.754
he left with the Christmas Eve
donation plate

09:46.787 --> 09:48.088
at the church
where he volunteered.

09:48.121 --> 09:48.956
They say that
I'm difficult.

09:48.989 --> 09:50.891
Best we can tell is,

09:50.924 --> 09:52.993
he's stolen a little over
$2 million over the years,

09:53.026 --> 09:54.962
mostly from small businesses
and old people.

09:54.995 --> 09:57.130
I don't get it.

09:57.164 --> 09:59.767
How does a homegrown terrorist
go from blowing up buildings

09:59.800 --> 10:02.736
to pulling off petty
financial schemes?

10:02.770 --> 10:04.237
How does he keep
getting away with it?

10:04.271 --> 10:06.239
Look at this.

10:06.273 --> 10:08.776
The users just found
one of Foley's aliases

10:08.809 --> 10:10.243
listed as the father
on a birth certificate

10:10.277 --> 10:12.012
in Duluth, Minnesota.

10:14.247 --> 10:17.751
He's got a son who's a freshman
at San Francisco State.

10:17.785 --> 10:19.753
That can't be a coincidence.
Must be why he's here.

10:19.787 --> 10:21.021
Call Cavanaugh.

10:21.054 --> 10:22.255
(elevator bell dings)

10:22.289 --> 10:24.224
So, this will only take
a second, all right?

10:24.257 --> 10:28.028
I promise you, we'll
get-- Hey, hey, hey, hey.

10:28.061 --> 10:30.898
I'll put this to bed quick,
and then we'll do our thing.

10:32.833 --> 10:35.002
I got tickets to the
Dubs, baby, the Dubs.

10:35.035 --> 10:36.737
JORDAN: Uh, actually, you know,
Dad, I was thinking, this time,

10:36.770 --> 10:38.005
maybe we could...
Jordan, hold that thought.

10:38.038 --> 10:40.040
Um, why don't you
stay in here,

10:40.073 --> 10:42.876
and, uh, I'll be
right back, okay?

10:42.910 --> 10:45.746
In fact, some
chips on me.

10:45.779 --> 10:47.014
Stay in the car.

10:47.047 --> 10:49.149
Always stay in the car.

10:49.182 --> 10:50.851
Sam, right?

10:50.884 --> 10:51.885
Yeah. Hi.

10:51.919 --> 10:53.086
Detective Cavanaugh.
Hey.

10:53.120 --> 10:54.755
Hey.

10:54.788 --> 10:57.691
You know this guy?

10:57.725 --> 10:58.892
Yeah.

10:58.926 --> 11:01.762
That's my father.

11:01.795 --> 11:04.031
I'm-I'm telling you,

11:04.064 --> 11:05.733
I don't know the man.

11:05.766 --> 11:07.167
I haven't had
any contact with him.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.136
You don't have any idea
where he is?

11:09.169 --> 11:13.040
Well, I haven't seen him
since I was four, so...

11:13.073 --> 11:15.709
Until ten minutes ago,
I thought he was dead.

11:15.743 --> 11:17.177
N-Now I find out that

11:17.210 --> 11:18.812
he's pretty much
the most wanted man in America

11:18.846 --> 11:20.180
for the last 20 years?

11:20.213 --> 11:22.282
That's great.

11:22.315 --> 11:24.918
That's... that's really great.

11:24.952 --> 11:26.086
I'm sorry about that, Sam.

11:26.119 --> 11:28.321
I know this must be
a lot to take in.

11:28.355 --> 11:30.223
You did nothing wrong.

11:30.257 --> 11:31.892
We're just trying to solve
a case, you understand?

11:31.925 --> 11:33.727
Yeah, right.

11:33.761 --> 11:36.196
It's just that people are
staking out my dorm

11:36.229 --> 11:38.932
and running up to me on campus
to ask me about a guy

11:38.966 --> 11:40.734
that I haven't seen in 15 years.

11:40.768 --> 11:46.073
I could really do without that
Sophe thing right about now.

11:46.106 --> 11:47.875
Yeah.

11:51.979 --> 11:54.314
I know exactly what you mean.

12:00.954 --> 12:02.990
You should just
set up a cot in here.

12:03.023 --> 12:05.759
Eh, I don't like the feng shui.

12:05.793 --> 12:07.027
Why are you still driving that?

12:07.060 --> 12:09.296
I mean, let the
cops take over.

12:09.329 --> 12:10.898
You know,
you're shorthanded.

12:10.931 --> 12:12.766
No.

12:12.800 --> 12:14.968
We'll lose users if there's
a drop in the functionality.

12:15.002 --> 12:16.804
Without Sara, I just want

12:16.837 --> 12:18.305
people to feel like
everything's normal.

12:18.338 --> 12:20.340
You want who to feel like that?
Them? You?

12:20.373 --> 12:22.910
Did you come here to give me
a hard time, Mike? Come on.

12:22.943 --> 12:25.846
No, I came to tell you
about a new problem.
Great.

12:25.879 --> 12:27.948
I talked to one of
my contacts at AllSourcer,

12:27.981 --> 12:30.017
and he said that
he's being subpoenaed

12:30.050 --> 12:32.152
by the House Cybersecurity
Committee.

12:32.185 --> 12:34.154
That's Alex's
committee.
Yeah.

12:34.187 --> 12:38.158
So, I mean, if Congress is
investigating AllSourcer,

12:38.191 --> 12:40.928
that's Nell's problem.
That's not mine.
(chuckles) No.

12:40.961 --> 12:42.395
Actually, it is your problem
because this guy

12:42.429 --> 12:44.297
doesn't work there anymore.
He's from your tenure.

12:44.331 --> 12:48.101
Alex's committee is coming
after something that I did?

12:48.135 --> 12:50.938
Well, I don't know,
but now might be a good time

12:50.971 --> 12:53.140
to call your ex-wife
and find out.
Oh, my God.

12:53.173 --> 12:55.342
Did this guy give you any
indication what this is about?

12:55.375 --> 12:57.377
Nope.

12:57.410 --> 13:00.313
Do you know?

13:00.347 --> 13:04.017
No, I don't.

13:04.051 --> 13:06.854
Look, let's just leave
it alone, all right?

13:06.887 --> 13:10.257
If it's a problem,
we'll know soon enough.

13:10.290 --> 13:12.359
Okay.

13:12.392 --> 13:15.228
Seriously.

13:15.262 --> 13:17.430
Do you need, like,
a futon or something?

13:17.464 --> 13:18.966
'Cause you're not moving.

13:18.999 --> 13:23.403
* Ooh *

13:25.472 --> 13:29.042
* Ooh *

13:33.480 --> 13:37.851
* Oh, my hands are tied

13:37.885 --> 13:39.920
* To a sharpened knife

13:39.953 --> 13:43.390
* Baby, roll the dice

13:43.423 --> 13:44.892
* Sick, seasick

13:44.925 --> 13:46.860
* From the tide

13:54.134 --> 13:55.969
* Got your darker smile

13:56.003 --> 14:00.473
* From your mama's side

14:00.507 --> 14:03.110
* But there's no silver line

14:03.143 --> 14:07.080
* Caught beneath your lies

14:07.114 --> 14:09.282
* Ooh *

14:13.420 --> 14:17.958
* I never knew you'd be so

14:17.991 --> 14:19.927
* Unforgettable

14:19.960 --> 14:24.998
* Ooh *

14:27.067 --> 14:30.437
* Ooh. *

14:33.406 --> 14:36.176
Duck confit...

14:36.209 --> 14:38.145
nachos.

14:38.178 --> 14:40.380
Very impressive.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.149
Did you...?

14:42.182 --> 14:44.484
I just wish I had some cilantro.

14:44.517 --> 14:46.419
Knock yourself out.
I got this right here.

14:46.453 --> 14:48.255
JORDAN:
Thank you.

14:48.288 --> 14:50.023
Absolutely.

14:50.057 --> 14:52.092
Are you sure this is your kid?

14:52.125 --> 14:53.526
He usually goes
for the Slim Jims.

14:53.560 --> 14:55.095
Yeah, well,
he's also a grown man

14:55.128 --> 14:56.529
who goes by
the name Tommy, so...

14:56.563 --> 14:59.266
Yeah, all right. We good here?
Yeah.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.534
You got a talented kid there.
(phone rings)

15:01.568 --> 15:03.170
Every time I see him,
it's like he's grown five feet.

15:03.203 --> 15:06.073
Yeah, I remember those days.
Yeah.

15:08.741 --> 15:11.144
Okay, what do you got?

15:11.178 --> 15:12.345
You may not think
Foley's son is important,

15:12.379 --> 15:14.281
but the users,
they're obsessed with him.

15:14.314 --> 15:17.017
TARIQ: They dug up everything
they could find on him,

15:17.050 --> 15:18.218
and then they posted it online.

15:18.251 --> 15:20.420
They straight up
doxed this kid.

15:20.453 --> 15:21.989
Well, I talked to Sam.
He doesn't know anything.

15:22.022 --> 15:23.523
I mean, can't you call them off?

15:23.556 --> 15:25.158
It's not that simple.
(sighs)

15:25.192 --> 15:26.459
This new, self-aware
version of the crowd?

15:26.493 --> 15:29.262
It is way more aggressive
than we had anticipated.

15:29.296 --> 15:30.397
How is this the most direct way
to find Foley?

15:30.430 --> 15:33.300
Detective, Sophe was designed
to turn over every rock.

15:33.333 --> 15:35.335
It may not be the route
that you would take,

15:35.368 --> 15:37.404
but we're gonna find
him. Trust me.

15:37.437 --> 15:38.471
Tanner, we...
MIKE:
Jeffrey.

15:38.505 --> 15:39.472
I tried calling you.

15:39.506 --> 15:41.574
Who is this?

15:41.608 --> 15:44.944
Dino Hutton. U.S.
Deputy Marshal.

15:47.214 --> 15:48.982
How can we help you, Marshal?

15:49.016 --> 15:50.483
You can stop whatever it is

15:50.517 --> 15:53.386
you're doing here immediately.

15:53.420 --> 15:55.255
What?
Jackson Foley,

15:55.288 --> 15:57.424
the guy you outed
with your-your little website.

15:57.457 --> 16:00.160
(chuckles)
All right? He is
a valuable government asset.

16:00.193 --> 16:01.995
He's part of the Federal
Witness Protection Program.

16:02.029 --> 16:03.430
Hold on, Foley's in WITSEC?

16:03.463 --> 16:05.298
TARIQ: Wait, so you're
protecting a terrorist?

16:05.332 --> 16:08.068
Gosh, imagine what would
happen if he looked like me.

16:08.101 --> 16:10.270
Foley did not blow up
that federal building.

16:10.303 --> 16:12.072
He rolled over
on the guys who did.

16:12.105 --> 16:14.307
What about the murder
in the liquor store?

16:14.341 --> 16:16.276
Well, he wasn't the killer.
He was the target.

16:16.309 --> 16:18.378
His old Sovereign Destiny
confederates

16:18.411 --> 16:21.181
trying to get even with him
for turning them in.

16:21.214 --> 16:23.050
Oh, this is great.
So, basically,

16:23.083 --> 16:25.118
you're protecting one bad guy
from a group of others.

16:25.152 --> 16:26.586
Okay, Foley is no angel,

16:26.619 --> 16:29.489
but, believe it or not,
the guy is actually a hero.

16:29.522 --> 16:31.291
I've been protecting him
for the past 20 years,

16:31.324 --> 16:33.426
and if you don't shut
down this machine here,

16:33.460 --> 16:35.995
you're gonna get him killed.

16:41.534 --> 16:42.702
JOSH: He doesn't get it.
That's the problem.

16:42.735 --> 16:44.071
No, it's saving lives.
That's the thing.

16:44.104 --> 16:45.238
It's an...
it's an actual function.

16:45.272 --> 16:46.706
No, it's not gonna
do them any...
Okay,

16:46.739 --> 16:48.308
so, what part of this
do you guys not understand?

16:48.341 --> 16:50.177
The people that want Foley dead,

16:50.210 --> 16:51.344
they're not a bunch of
shotgun-toting deplorables.

16:51.378 --> 16:53.246
They're more than capable

16:53.280 --> 16:56.616
of using this site to figure out
exactly where he is.

16:56.649 --> 16:58.751
Look, even if we
could shut it down,

16:58.785 --> 17:00.620
it wouldn't do any good.
The users would just migrate

17:00.653 --> 17:02.021
the investigation to
a parallel platform.

17:02.055 --> 17:04.324
I don't know what he's saying.
Okay, you know
how people have friends

17:04.357 --> 17:07.094
on Facebook and Twitter?

17:07.127 --> 17:08.761
Y-You probably
don't have friends, do you?

17:08.795 --> 17:10.297
If we shut down

17:10.330 --> 17:12.099
the discussion boards,

17:12.132 --> 17:14.067
the search for Foley
will go somewhere else,

17:14.101 --> 17:15.368
and then we won't be able
to track it.

17:15.402 --> 17:16.636
Well, we got to do something,

17:17.670 --> 17:18.305
because right now this
is working for the bad guys.

17:19.038 --> 17:19.539
Well, you have to let my people

17:20.039 --> 17:20.740
do their jobs, then.

17:20.773 --> 17:22.242
All right?

17:22.275 --> 17:24.311
Josh, let the users
know that Foley

17:24.344 --> 17:27.080
is in Witness Protection
and not a suspect.
Okay.

17:27.114 --> 17:29.382
Tariq, make sure that
everyone is steered over

17:29.416 --> 17:31.184
to the confidential tip line.
On it.

17:31.218 --> 17:33.586
Hold on. They're watching
Sophe and can't find Foley?

17:33.620 --> 17:35.288
Then they're gonna look
for his son.

17:35.322 --> 17:37.624
What's going on?
Give me one second.

17:37.657 --> 17:38.658
I need a pair of
black-and-whites

17:38.691 --> 17:41.394
to go and take Sam Calder
into protective custody.

17:41.428 --> 17:42.595
That's right.

17:42.629 --> 17:43.363
Sam Calder.

17:48.368 --> 17:51.238
Can I talk to you in private?

17:51.271 --> 17:54.341
Tanner?
Yeah.

17:54.374 --> 17:57.777
HUTTON: Do you have any idea
the colossal amount

17:57.810 --> 17:59.146
of crap that you've stirred up?

18:00.280 --> 18:01.581
You can't just blow the cover
of someone in the program.

18:02.749 --> 18:03.616
I think we both can agree
he was already compromised.

18:04.417 --> 18:05.252
I get it.
This is your pet project.

18:06.153 --> 18:06.819
You want to solve
your daughter's murder.

18:08.087 --> 18:08.688
But do you even care about the
amount of damage you're causing?

18:09.522 --> 18:10.123
Thank you. Yes, I care.
I care a lot.

18:10.890 --> 18:12.292
But I'm not gonna
take Sophe down

18:12.325 --> 18:14.294
just because you lost control
of your snitch.

18:14.327 --> 18:16.296
Okay, listen, we have protocols.

18:16.329 --> 18:18.298
Sure, Foley should have called
us to arrange a pickup,

18:18.331 --> 18:20.367
but you got the picture out so
fast, he probably got spooked.

18:20.400 --> 18:22.302
Well, what's preventing him

18:22.335 --> 18:24.437
from picking up a phone
right now?
I don't know.

18:24.471 --> 18:25.838
Maybe the city
full of vigilantes

18:25.872 --> 18:27.440
that you've empowered
to hunt him down.

18:27.474 --> 18:29.442
I swear to God,

18:29.476 --> 18:31.311
if you get him killed,
the federal government's

18:31.344 --> 18:33.446
gonna come down
on your head so fast...
I'll tell you what.

18:33.480 --> 18:34.714
Why don't you bring
the head Cheeto down

18:34.747 --> 18:36.216
right now. All right?

18:36.249 --> 18:37.817
Let's do it.

18:37.850 --> 18:39.719
I'll ruin you
in the press, Tanner.

18:39.752 --> 18:41.288
How are you gonna solve
your daughter's murder

18:41.321 --> 18:43.290
without public sentiment?

18:43.323 --> 18:45.258
That is what this place runs on,
isn't it?

18:49.762 --> 18:52.465
(sighs) I never really thought
law school would prepare me

18:52.499 --> 18:54.667
for a future
in delivering laundry.

18:54.701 --> 18:55.835
You are a lifesaver.

18:55.868 --> 18:57.770
Wow.

18:57.804 --> 18:59.872
I didn't realize
how much of my stuff

18:59.906 --> 19:01.474
had ended up at Jeffrey's.

19:01.508 --> 19:02.875
Uh, can we talk for a minute?

19:02.909 --> 19:04.877
Sure.

19:04.911 --> 19:08.315
Come in.

19:08.348 --> 19:11.384
Do you want some tea?

19:11.418 --> 19:13.353
Uh, yeah. That'd be great.

19:13.386 --> 19:15.288
Milk?
Yeah.

19:15.322 --> 19:16.456
Perfect.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.758
So, how's everyone doing

19:18.791 --> 19:20.693
with the WITSEC thing?

19:20.727 --> 19:22.695
I've been checking
the forums, and...
No, no, Sara.

19:22.729 --> 19:25.265
You... you can't go on Sophe,
even as a user.

19:26.366 --> 19:29.236
Of course.

19:29.269 --> 19:30.703
I just...

19:32.939 --> 19:34.741
(sighs)

19:34.774 --> 19:35.975
How's Jeffrey?

19:36.008 --> 19:37.777
Oh, he's okay.

19:37.810 --> 19:40.513
He-he misses you.

19:40.547 --> 19:43.350
Um, you know, actually, can...

19:43.383 --> 19:45.385
can we tell him
that you're a mess?

19:45.418 --> 19:47.820
You know, that your life
is-is unfulfilled without him?
(chuckles)

19:47.854 --> 19:50.390
There's nothing for you.
It'd make him feel better.
Sure. While you're at it,

19:50.423 --> 19:51.424
tell him I've started
knitting and baking pies.
(chuckles)

19:56.296 --> 19:58.231
But you're not here

19:58.265 --> 20:00.800
to discuss my domestic life,
are you?

20:00.833 --> 20:02.835
No, I want to talk to you

20:02.869 --> 20:04.437
about the next steps
in the AllSourcer case.

20:04.471 --> 20:06.539
All right, normally,
this TRO thing

20:06.573 --> 20:08.007
might only last
a couple days, but

20:08.040 --> 20:09.776
this is all about you, Sara.

20:09.809 --> 20:10.943
They want to use you
as a bargaining chip

20:10.977 --> 20:12.479
to force Jeffrey
to the table.

20:12.512 --> 20:13.913
But we've got
good lawyers.

20:13.946 --> 20:16.416
I mean, we're gonna
fight back, right?
Yes.

20:16.449 --> 20:18.285
The more pressing problem
is your visa.

20:18.318 --> 20:21.421
All right, you came here
on an H-1B,

20:21.454 --> 20:23.290
which is contingent
upon your working.

20:23.323 --> 20:24.557
So, if this case drags on

20:24.591 --> 20:26.426
and makes it difficult
for you to work

20:26.459 --> 20:27.494
for any appreciable amount
of time...
Right.

20:27.527 --> 20:30.497
I grok the implications, Mike.

20:32.465 --> 20:35.835
And you're okay?
What do you think?

20:35.868 --> 20:38.805
If all I wanted was to stay
in this country, there's...

20:38.838 --> 20:40.573
there's plenty of jobs
I could have taken.

20:40.607 --> 20:42.442
Sophe is the realization
of all my work.

20:42.475 --> 20:43.910
It's-it's
my creation.

20:43.943 --> 20:46.479
It's mine and Jeffrey's.

20:46.513 --> 20:48.815
AllSourcer had nothing
to do with it,

20:48.848 --> 20:51.050
and now they're trying
to take it away from me.

20:51.083 --> 20:52.552
I know.

20:52.585 --> 20:54.921
And I'm sorry.

20:54.954 --> 20:56.789
(sighs)

20:56.823 --> 21:00.460
Well...

21:00.493 --> 21:02.862
on the bright side,

21:02.895 --> 21:05.365
England's lovely
this time of year.

21:05.398 --> 21:07.400
(sighs)

21:07.434 --> 21:08.801
Thanks.

21:08.835 --> 21:10.036
What did I miss?

21:10.069 --> 21:12.004
Uh, not much.

21:12.038 --> 21:14.073
The guys are messing
with the forums.

21:14.106 --> 21:15.575
They're trying to change
the way the users work,

21:15.608 --> 21:17.410
without turning
anyone off.

21:17.444 --> 21:19.346
It's not going well.
(phone rings and buzzes)

21:21.381 --> 21:22.549
Cavanaugh.

21:23.616 --> 21:26.553
I need some help. They found me.
Sam?

21:26.586 --> 21:28.921
Sam, who found you?
The-the guys after my dad.

21:28.955 --> 21:30.423
What-what you talk...?
Where are you, Sam?

21:30.457 --> 21:32.024
Oh, crap.

21:32.058 --> 21:33.893
Just tell me where you are.

21:33.926 --> 21:34.527
Sam?

21:38.465 --> 21:40.567
(engine revving,
tires squealing)

21:45.004 --> 21:46.939
Oh, God.

21:48.441 --> 21:51.411
(tires squealing)

21:52.612 --> 21:54.547
(engine revving)

21:59.018 --> 22:01.020
(tires squeak)

22:01.053 --> 22:02.589
Sam, what's going on?
Talk to me, man!

22:02.622 --> 22:03.856
They're trying to kill me!

22:05.892 --> 22:08.928
I need help.
(grunts)

22:08.961 --> 22:11.063
Where are you? Just give me
a landmark, and I'll send a car.

22:11.097 --> 22:13.933
No, please. Please.

22:13.966 --> 22:15.668
Please. I'm not
a part of this.

22:15.702 --> 22:17.670
Please. I had nothing
to do with this. Please.

22:17.704 --> 22:19.038
Sam, are you there?

22:19.071 --> 22:20.507
Stay down!
Dad?

22:23.543 --> 22:25.612
(tires squealing)

22:27.013 --> 22:28.615
Sam?

22:28.648 --> 22:30.450
Sam...

22:35.121 --> 22:36.523
(evidence alert blaring)
Shots fired near campus.

22:36.556 --> 22:37.524
Users report
a van speeding away.

22:37.557 --> 22:38.825
Responses are still coming in.

22:38.858 --> 22:40.593
It's all going public.
TANNER:
Damn it.

22:40.627 --> 22:42.094
They're gonna lead
the hit men right back to them.

22:42.128 --> 22:43.496
I thought you had his son
in protective custody.

22:44.464 --> 22:44.797
He was laying low
at his friend's place.

22:45.698 --> 22:46.032
Sophe users
were staking out his dorm.

22:46.833 --> 22:47.500
How do you know
they're together?

22:48.300 --> 22:49.101
I distinctly heard him
say "Dad."

22:50.870 --> 22:52.872
Yeah, they're together.

22:52.905 --> 22:55.074
JOSH:
All right, three squad cars

22:55.107 --> 22:56.676
in the area, headed
that direction.

22:56.709 --> 22:58.645
At this hour?
They'll never get there in time.

22:58.678 --> 22:59.879
HUTTON:
Tanner, I already
told you, you need

22:59.912 --> 23:01.047
to shut this down,
let us bring him in.

23:01.080 --> 23:02.915
Leave it to the
professionals.

23:02.949 --> 23:05.151
And they already told you,
they can't shut the users down.

23:05.184 --> 23:07.153
TANNER:
No, but we can
slow them. Josh,

23:07.186 --> 23:09.155
can you give me a delay
between submissions

23:09.188 --> 23:11.758
and when they appear?
Sure, but if people
catch on...

23:11.791 --> 23:14.761
No, it won't be that long.
It'll be like a refresh lag.

23:14.794 --> 23:16.629
CAVANAUGH:
Whatever you're doing,
do it quick.

23:16.663 --> 23:18.698
There's a lot of dots
popping up on this thing.

23:18.731 --> 23:20.800
TANNER:
We just need to disrupt
the flow of information.

23:20.833 --> 23:22.001
It's not working. Users are

23:22.034 --> 23:23.970
still tracking.
Okay.

23:24.003 --> 23:25.805
Well, just increase
the delay.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.175
People are noticing.
TANNER:
Make it

23:29.208 --> 23:31.010
proximity-based, all right?
Give me exponential backoff.

23:31.043 --> 23:33.179
Got it.
HUTTON:
Hey, how about somebody

23:33.212 --> 23:35.014
tell me what the hell
it is you're saying?

23:35.047 --> 23:36.182
JOSH:
The closer a report is
to recent data,

23:36.215 --> 23:38.150
the longer it takes to appear.

23:38.184 --> 23:40.887
It makes it harder to chain
the information together.

23:40.920 --> 23:42.555
Look. I think
it's working.

23:43.790 --> 23:45.925
The posts are slowing.

23:45.958 --> 23:48.595
Users lost track
of the van.

23:54.667 --> 23:56.803
Mike?

23:56.836 --> 23:58.671
We need her back. Sara.

23:58.705 --> 24:00.707
What are you talking about?
You handled that like a champ.

24:00.740 --> 24:03.676
I just plugged a leaky boat
with bubble gum, all right?

24:03.710 --> 24:05.678
Look, Foley and his son
are still out there.

24:05.712 --> 24:07.113
We need the users
back on our side,

24:07.146 --> 24:08.948
or it's only going
to get worse.

24:08.981 --> 24:11.684
Jeffrey, the damage it would do
to bring her back here,

24:11.718 --> 24:13.753
not to mention the civil
contempt charges, okay?

24:13.786 --> 24:15.855
I am Jobs, and she's
Wozniak, all right?

24:15.888 --> 24:18.124
I can pull the levers,
she created the system.

24:18.157 --> 24:20.960
We need her back. Call her.

24:20.993 --> 24:23.062
Or I will.

24:28.067 --> 24:30.136
(playing Debussy's
"Clair de Lune")

24:50.222 --> 24:52.792
(sighs)

24:58.030 --> 25:01.634
(playing Deep Purple's
"Smoke on the Water")

25:09.809 --> 25:11.143
(playing discordant notes)

25:11.177 --> 25:13.145
(phone ringing and buzzing)

25:13.179 --> 25:15.247
(sighs)

25:15.281 --> 25:17.684
Hello.

25:23.189 --> 25:25.825
Thank God.

25:25.858 --> 25:27.827
Okay, boys and girls,
what do we have?

25:27.860 --> 25:29.195
Users lost track of the van
somewhere in the Inner Sunset.

25:29.228 --> 25:31.197
We have about 200
users in the area.

25:31.230 --> 25:34.233
Forum postings are at about
30 a minute and rising.

25:34.266 --> 25:36.035
Prevailing opinion is that Foley
is a danger to the public.

25:36.068 --> 25:37.704
Okay, we need
to get that under control.

25:37.737 --> 25:40.272
So, who is this?
Leave this to
the professionals.

25:40.306 --> 25:41.874
SARA:
User sentiment has been

25:41.908 --> 25:43.309
overrun by group think.

25:43.342 --> 25:45.177
We need to introduce
some dissonance dynamics.

25:45.211 --> 25:47.814
Okay, does anybody here
speak American?

25:49.081 --> 25:51.250
The crowd is fixating

25:51.283 --> 25:53.920
on one approach to the
detriment of better ideas.

25:53.953 --> 25:55.955
Minority opinions are
being shouted down.

25:55.988 --> 25:57.757
We're losing
diversity of thought.

25:57.790 --> 25:58.958
SARA:
Fewer competing theories
means the majority

25:58.991 --> 26:00.326
feels empowered.

26:00.359 --> 26:02.328
You end up with a
torch-wielding mob,

26:02.361 --> 26:04.997
and anyone who disagrees with
them just stops participating.

26:05.031 --> 26:08.968
How do you fix it?
We are gonna make it okay
to think differently.

26:09.001 --> 26:10.737
Josh, Tariq, get
a team together,

26:10.770 --> 26:11.771
make some
dummy accounts,

26:11.804 --> 26:14.173
and go on forums.
Got it.

26:14.206 --> 26:16.843
Try and get into
some arguments.
So how is this gonna help?

26:16.876 --> 26:18.344
It'll let people know that
not everyone thinks the same,

26:18.377 --> 26:20.179
that it's okay to disagree.

26:20.212 --> 26:22.882
You know, like
stepping up to a bully.

26:22.915 --> 26:25.051
That's my son Jordan.

26:26.753 --> 26:28.220
You want to get
in on this?

26:28.254 --> 26:30.256
Yeah. Grab
a terminal.

26:30.289 --> 26:32.124
Insult people.

26:32.158 --> 26:33.159
Type in all caps.

26:41.901 --> 26:43.970
You'll be happy to hear
diversity of opinion seems

26:44.003 --> 26:46.005
to be returning to the forums.

26:46.038 --> 26:49.075
The users have begun steering
submissions into the tip line

26:49.108 --> 26:50.877
instead of posting
to public.

26:50.910 --> 26:52.845
Marshal, I think you
owe Sara an apology.

26:52.879 --> 26:54.013
Oh, for what?

26:54.046 --> 26:56.115
For solving your mess?

26:56.148 --> 26:58.050
(laughs)
You basically just

26:58.084 --> 27:01.854
called off the mob that
you created, but sure.

27:01.888 --> 27:04.090
Private sector always better
than the government, right?

27:04.123 --> 27:05.792
Hey, sorry to interrupt.

27:05.825 --> 27:07.326
Sophe may have just
tracked down Foley.

27:07.359 --> 27:10.062
You were saying?

27:15.968 --> 27:17.937
TARIQ:
A user who works
for the phone company

27:17.970 --> 27:19.271
submitted cell tower logs

27:19.305 --> 27:21.273
from nodes
near the murder site.

27:21.307 --> 27:22.809
They came in over
private channels.

27:22.842 --> 27:24.110
JOSH:
We cross-referenced it with data

27:24.143 --> 27:25.277
from towers
near the apartment building

27:25.311 --> 27:26.879
where shots were fired
this afternoon.

27:26.913 --> 27:28.147
TARIQ:
Only one phone
was common to both.

27:28.180 --> 27:30.282
We believe this to be

27:30.316 --> 27:31.417
Foley's burner phone.

27:31.450 --> 27:34.253
(phones ringing)

27:34.286 --> 27:35.354
This is Cavanaugh.
Yeah, this is Hutton.

27:35.387 --> 27:37.356
We got something on Foley.

27:37.389 --> 27:40.226
CAVANAUGH:
Hey, I need emergency
tracking data on a cell phone.

27:40.259 --> 27:42.161
HUTTON: Yeah. I can tell you.
All right, let me know
when you're ready for the ID.

27:42.194 --> 27:44.330
Nice job, gentlemen.

27:44.363 --> 27:46.866
TANNER:
Josh, that stuff

27:46.899 --> 27:48.334
I said before--
I didn't mean it.

27:48.367 --> 27:50.069
Thanks.

27:50.102 --> 27:52.071
Wait. What'd you say earlier?

27:52.104 --> 27:53.272
CAVANAUGH:
Say, I hate to be
this guy, but

27:53.305 --> 27:54.974
can he stay here while
we go pick up Foley?

27:55.007 --> 27:56.375
No problem.

27:56.408 --> 27:59.078
Jordan, can I offer you
a white truffle Kobe slider?

28:01.213 --> 28:04.450
Y'all take culinary
appropriation to lengths

28:04.483 --> 28:07.854
that are both gastronomically
and culturally offensive.

28:07.887 --> 28:08.988
I will take that
as a yes.

28:09.021 --> 28:10.389
I will.
That's my boy.

28:10.422 --> 28:12.124
That's my boy.
All right.

28:12.158 --> 28:13.993
Hutton, let's go.
I'm driving.

28:16.929 --> 28:19.165
Come on. Let's go get a boba.

28:19.198 --> 28:21.433
TARIQ:
Nice assist today.

28:21.467 --> 28:25.404
Some of those posts you've
made-- does your dad know

28:25.437 --> 28:27.239
you talk like that?

28:27.273 --> 28:30.176
Are you kidding?
It would break him.

28:30.209 --> 28:33.145
I can't imagine what it'd be
like to be Cavanaugh's kid.

28:33.179 --> 28:35.214
It's not so bad.
He's my dad, you know?

28:35.247 --> 28:37.083
I guess he
just likes

28:37.116 --> 28:38.951
things to be a certain way.

28:38.985 --> 28:40.987
He wishes
I was eight years old forever.

28:41.020 --> 28:43.422
Hey, come down here a sec.

28:47.259 --> 28:49.161
(beeping)

28:49.195 --> 28:50.162
What's up?
Something didn't
seem right,

28:50.196 --> 28:52.231
so I went digging through
the cell tower logs.

28:52.264 --> 28:55.301
What do you make of this?

28:55.334 --> 28:57.937
Dude, you're paranoid.

28:57.970 --> 28:59.238
They tracked
this guy down already.

28:59.271 --> 29:00.973
Hey, do you want
to play some Ping-Pong?

29:01.007 --> 29:02.241
What's it say?
Nothing.

29:02.274 --> 29:03.943
Josh just had
way too much cold medicine.

29:03.976 --> 29:05.311
Nickel a point,
rally for serve?
Make it a buck.

29:05.344 --> 29:07.446
Sounds good. Get Tanner.

29:07.479 --> 29:08.881
Hurry.

29:12.184 --> 29:15.354
CAVANAUGH:
According to the tracking info,

29:15.387 --> 29:18.057
the van is in the
parking garage.

29:18.090 --> 29:20.259
Hutton said Foley didn't
follow protocol, right?

29:20.292 --> 29:23.262
But according to these phone
logs, Foley did call Hutton

29:23.295 --> 29:25.197
about ten minutes
before the liquor store

29:25.231 --> 29:26.966
shooting went down.
SARA:
Checking in with his handler.

29:26.999 --> 29:28.367
JOSH:
So,

29:28.400 --> 29:30.069
Hutton had
to know Foley had a cell phone.

29:30.102 --> 29:31.303
Which means he was lying.

29:38.310 --> 29:40.412
Why lie?
Because,

29:40.446 --> 29:42.081
right after Foley checked
in with him,

29:42.114 --> 29:43.282
the deputy marshal
called an unlisted number

29:43.315 --> 29:44.984
with an Idaho
area code.

29:45.017 --> 29:48.087
Hutton tipped off the killers.

29:48.120 --> 29:49.355
Cavanaugh's walking into a trap.

29:49.388 --> 29:51.457
It must be that van.

29:51.490 --> 29:54.460
We're in a
parking garage

29:54.493 --> 29:56.428
in the corner of Northwest Sixth
and Carillo.

30:01.200 --> 30:02.501
That won't be a problem.

30:02.534 --> 30:04.370
Let's go.

30:12.444 --> 30:15.848
Jack Foley!

30:15.882 --> 30:18.817
I'm Detective Cavanaugh
from the SFPD.

30:20.452 --> 30:22.021
Deputy Marshal Hutton and I

30:22.054 --> 30:23.990
came to take you into
protective custody.

30:26.058 --> 30:27.826
Mr. Foley!

30:40.072 --> 30:42.141
HUTTON:
Come on out, Jack.

30:42.174 --> 30:43.509
It's all safe.

30:47.013 --> 30:48.480
Mr. Foley.

30:48.514 --> 30:49.949
Are you in the vehicle?

31:09.301 --> 31:11.870
All clear!

31:15.507 --> 31:17.944
(phone rings and buzzes)

31:19.211 --> 31:21.680
Cavanaugh.

31:21.713 --> 31:23.282
TANNER:
Hutton is working with
the bad guys.

31:23.315 --> 31:25.551
He's the one who set Foley up,
you hear me?

31:25.584 --> 31:27.686
Leave us on the line, but you
got to get out of there.

31:27.719 --> 31:29.588
Yeah, thanks.

31:32.058 --> 31:33.659
Bad luck.

31:33.692 --> 31:35.327
Friends must have
figured it out, huh?

31:35.361 --> 31:36.929
CAVANAUGH:
Think about what you're doing,
Hutton.

31:36.963 --> 31:39.531
Damn it.
SFPD is six minutes out.

31:39.565 --> 31:41.000
Not fast enough.
I'm checking to see

31:41.033 --> 31:42.134
what users we have in the area.

31:44.971 --> 31:46.538
There's nowhere you can go

31:46.572 --> 31:48.274
that Tanner and
his people won't find you.

31:48.307 --> 31:51.643
I've been making people
disappear for 26 years.

31:51.677 --> 31:53.679
You don't think I know
how to vanish?

31:53.712 --> 31:55.948
You saw the way
Sophe works.

31:55.982 --> 31:57.316
Huh? You really want to take
that chance?

31:57.349 --> 31:58.650
That's it, keep him talking.

32:00.252 --> 32:02.955
JOSH:
Guys, I think I figured out

32:02.989 --> 32:05.124
where all that money
Foley stole went. Hutton has

32:05.157 --> 32:07.159
a bunch of bank accounts
opened under fake names.

32:07.193 --> 32:10.596
It's kind of genius, seeing as
how his job is pretty much

32:10.629 --> 32:12.731
to invent people
who don't actually exist.
Yeah.

32:12.764 --> 32:14.100
You're going down, Tariq.

32:14.133 --> 32:15.234
Let's see it.

32:15.267 --> 32:17.603
(exhales)
Oh.

32:17.636 --> 32:19.605
Where are you, Jack?

32:21.240 --> 32:23.042
Right here, Marshal.

32:27.413 --> 32:29.215
What's with the gun, Jack?

32:29.248 --> 32:30.382
I'm here to help you.

32:30.416 --> 32:32.584
No, he isn't.

32:32.618 --> 32:34.620
He tipped off your old buddies,
that's how they found you.

32:38.624 --> 32:40.759
All right,
let the cop go.

32:40.792 --> 32:43.162
HUTTON:
What's your play here, Jack?
Think this through?

32:43.195 --> 32:44.263
How's this gonna end?

32:44.296 --> 32:46.598
Anyone want next?

32:46.632 --> 32:48.634
Come on, five-four.
You're up.

32:48.667 --> 32:50.169
Me, I want next.
I want next.

32:50.202 --> 32:51.270
Let's go.
Yeah, all right.

32:51.303 --> 32:53.039
I don't know,

32:53.072 --> 32:55.374
but I am done stealing for you.

32:55.407 --> 32:57.609
That's for sure.
HUTTON:
Oh, it's not too late.

32:57.643 --> 32:59.111
We could both
split the money.

32:59.145 --> 33:00.312
Disappear.

33:01.680 --> 33:03.149
CAVANAUGH:
Foley, Foley.

33:03.182 --> 33:04.616
Think about your son, huh?

33:04.650 --> 33:06.618
You just reconnected with him.

33:06.652 --> 33:08.687
HUTTON:
You think this cop
is gonna let you go?

33:10.222 --> 33:12.024
CAVANAUGH:
Think about your kid.

33:12.058 --> 33:13.259
Think about Sam.

33:13.292 --> 33:15.261
Dad.

33:15.294 --> 33:17.129
(car engine revs, tires squeal)

33:17.163 --> 33:19.631
(gunshots)

33:19.665 --> 33:21.700
Cavanaugh!
(gunshots)

33:24.136 --> 33:26.338
(tires screech)

33:40.352 --> 33:41.753
Take care of Sam.

33:45.091 --> 33:46.225
(engine starts)

33:46.258 --> 33:48.360
(tires screeching)

33:51.197 --> 33:53.365
Cavanaugh!
CAVANAUGH:
Hutton's getting away.

33:53.399 --> 33:55.667
Headed down the structure in a
pickup with two Caucasian males.

33:59.305 --> 34:02.408
(siren whoops)

34:02.441 --> 34:05.444
Come on, come on.
Where the hell is the SFPD?

34:05.477 --> 34:08.714
Hold on. I've got an active user
who works in the building.

34:08.747 --> 34:10.816
Where are the cops coming from?
They're headed down
North Street.

34:10.849 --> 34:14.220
Yeah, just a sec.
I know the security guy.

34:14.253 --> 34:16.155
I'm gonna hand it over
to Mohammed now.

34:16.188 --> 34:17.823
How can I help you?

34:17.856 --> 34:20.092
Mohammed, is there any way
that you can divert

34:20.126 --> 34:22.394
all of the traffic
to the North Street exit?

34:22.428 --> 34:24.363
(brakes screech)

34:27.266 --> 34:28.667
Sure. Give me a sec.

34:35.307 --> 34:36.475
Go left! Go left!

34:36.508 --> 34:38.444
(brakes screech)

34:40.412 --> 34:42.381
(siren whoops)

34:52.158 --> 34:53.825
(sirens wailing)

35:07.306 --> 35:08.274
Hands up!

35:08.307 --> 35:10.242
Hands where I can see 'em!

35:10.276 --> 35:11.710
CAVANAUGH:
Everyone out of the truck!

35:12.944 --> 35:14.280
Hutton.

35:14.313 --> 35:15.881
Out of the truck.

35:15.914 --> 35:17.816
We got him.
SARA: Yes!

35:17.849 --> 35:18.717
Yes!

35:19.851 --> 35:22.821
(whooping and applause)

35:22.854 --> 35:24.190
Thank you, Mohammed.
You're welcome.

35:25.291 --> 35:27.359
(sighs)

35:27.393 --> 35:29.395
What?

35:29.428 --> 35:30.896
That is my dad, right?

35:30.929 --> 35:32.264
How did you...?

35:32.298 --> 35:33.932
When your dad's a cop,

35:33.965 --> 35:35.434
you learn how to know
when someone's covering.

35:35.467 --> 35:38.404
Come on, let's go join 'em.

35:38.437 --> 35:41.173
(sighs)
All right.

35:43.575 --> 35:44.743
You know the drill.
Get down.

35:50.916 --> 35:52.518
I had Dubs tickets.

35:54.320 --> 35:56.222
Get him out of here.

36:06.498 --> 36:08.434
Can you just give me
one minute, please?

36:24.583 --> 36:26.518
Take care of yourself, son.

36:40.532 --> 36:42.868
So what now?
He just goes back

36:42.901 --> 36:45.504
to Witness Protection,
like nothing happened?

36:45.537 --> 36:46.538
New city, new identity.

36:49.541 --> 36:50.976
Doesn't really seem fair.

36:51.009 --> 36:53.945
CAVANAUGH:
No. No, it doesn't.

36:53.979 --> 36:56.915
Look, I know this is
not much consolation,

36:56.948 --> 36:58.950
but I checked with
the U.S. attorney.

36:58.984 --> 37:02.254
Hutton told the truth
about one thing:

37:02.288 --> 37:04.656
your dad didn't know anything
about blowing up that building.

37:04.690 --> 37:06.392
And when he found
out, he got out.

37:06.425 --> 37:07.959
(elevator bell dings)

37:14.366 --> 37:18.470
I guess he did
save my life today.

37:18.504 --> 37:20.606
Whatever else he's done, it's...

37:20.639 --> 37:22.541
got to be worth something.

37:22.574 --> 37:25.010
Well, like it or not,

37:25.043 --> 37:27.346
a dad's always gonna
look out for his son.

37:31.650 --> 37:33.885
Good luck to you.

37:41.727 --> 37:44.363
Mmm.

37:44.396 --> 37:46.298
Okay.

37:46.332 --> 37:48.700
It's incredible, son.

37:48.734 --> 37:50.502
Incredible.

37:50.536 --> 37:52.404
See? Life skills.

37:52.438 --> 37:54.573
You know,
I could teach you.

37:54.606 --> 37:56.575
I'm sure you could.

37:56.608 --> 37:58.544
(grunts)

38:01.380 --> 38:03.315
I can't believe you have
to go home tomorrow.

38:03.349 --> 38:04.983
You know, we missed
the game, and...

38:05.016 --> 38:06.318
Nah. That's all right.

38:06.352 --> 38:08.053
No. No.

38:08.086 --> 38:11.523
It's... it's our thing
and I'm sorry, son.

38:13.124 --> 38:15.994
Honestly, Dad...

38:16.027 --> 38:17.563
that's more your thing.

38:19.498 --> 38:21.333
(laughing):
What? What? My...

38:21.367 --> 38:25.337
My thing?

38:25.371 --> 38:26.472
Are you saying you
don't like basketball?

38:26.505 --> 38:27.673
Uh-uh.

38:27.706 --> 38:30.342
Oh, hell, no. Wh...

38:30.376 --> 38:32.378
Why did you
never tell me?

38:32.411 --> 38:34.746
Because you like it.

38:34.780 --> 38:37.383
Besides, today I
finally got to see

38:37.416 --> 38:39.485
what my dad does
for a living.

38:39.518 --> 38:42.754
Sort of figured it would be
a letdown after, you know,

38:42.788 --> 38:45.491
traveling the world with
your mom and everything.

38:45.524 --> 38:47.359
You saved a kid's life.

38:47.393 --> 38:49.361
Mom sells buttered snails

38:49.395 --> 38:51.697
for a stupid
amount of money.
Stupid.

38:51.730 --> 38:54.533
Besides, it's not a competition.

38:54.566 --> 38:56.435
Well, I know that, you know?

38:56.468 --> 38:59.638
It's just... (sighs)

38:59.671 --> 39:02.374
It's just that,
I think she gets you

39:02.408 --> 39:05.043
more than I do, sometimes.

39:05.076 --> 39:07.045
Dad, I'm 15.

39:07.078 --> 39:09.681
Even I don't get me
half the time.

39:09.715 --> 39:12.518
(laughs) Yeah.

39:12.551 --> 39:15.053
Oh, I know what
would go perfect

39:15.086 --> 39:17.088
with these steaks.
Hmm?

39:17.122 --> 39:20.792
Basketball.
(laughs)

39:20.826 --> 39:22.994
Why am I supposed
to love basketball?

39:23.028 --> 39:25.697
Because you're tall, son.
Because you're tall.

39:25.731 --> 39:28.634
TANNER: (sighs)
Okay.

39:28.667 --> 39:31.069
Yeah. Thanks.

39:32.438 --> 39:34.139
That was Mike.

39:34.172 --> 39:36.141
Judge is pissed.

39:36.174 --> 39:38.544
Wants the lawyers there
in court first thing tomorrow.

39:38.577 --> 39:40.412
We'll argue public interest.

39:40.446 --> 39:42.414
We got a killer off the streets.

39:42.448 --> 39:44.616
Multiple killers, actually.

39:46.151 --> 39:47.819
Jeffrey, what
if we lose?

39:47.853 --> 39:49.721
What if their lawyers
are just better?

39:49.755 --> 39:51.022
What if...?
We'll win.

39:51.056 --> 39:53.592
No matter what they throw at us,

39:53.625 --> 39:55.627
we will beat it together.

39:57.629 --> 39:59.765
So we're gonna be okay?

39:59.798 --> 40:02.133
We're gonna be fine.
