00:06.000 --> 00:07.500
<i>Previously on </i>The Recruit:

00:07.583 --> 00:09.791
-Do you know who gatekeeper is yet?
-Lev Orlova.

00:09.875 --> 00:12.750
It's the Council member
who I need to bribe to welcome me back.

00:12.833 --> 00:14.708
Can you unsanction a Swiss bank account?

00:14.791 --> 00:18.333
Welcome to Geneva.
I'll be your operational support here.

00:18.416 --> 00:21.750
We go to the Bank of Geneva,
access one of Max's sanctioned accounts.

00:21.833 --> 00:25.375
Once the money is secure,
Max will reach out to Lev Orlova

00:25.458 --> 00:28.833
and set a meeting so she can buy her way
out of the Russian mafia doghouse.

00:28.916 --> 00:31.041
This is a uniquely dangerous moment, Owen.

00:31.125 --> 00:35.541
-We can only rely on each other.
-You think they're sleeping together?

00:37.958 --> 00:38.875
Hi.

00:38.958 --> 00:40.583
-How's it going?
-Better.

00:40.666 --> 00:42.041
-Owen.
-Marta.

00:43.041 --> 00:44.291
-Cheers.
-<i>Skál.</i>

00:44.875 --> 00:45.791
Who is this?

00:45.875 --> 00:46.875
A killer.

00:46.958 --> 00:49.833
He can't save you
if I decide to end your life.

00:49.916 --> 00:53.000
Then you will never find out
who slept with Stasia.

00:53.541 --> 00:54.583
I have pictures.

00:54.666 --> 00:57.208
The bounty, is it still 2 million euros?

00:57.291 --> 00:58.125
Pay her.

00:58.208 --> 01:00.333
No, send it to Lev.

01:02.833 --> 01:03.875
I am so dead.

01:21.583 --> 01:25.458
-Shit.
-Fuck. That's Xander.

01:26.250 --> 01:29.666
Do you think Max killed him? Or Hendricks?

01:29.750 --> 01:32.916
That's not what's important right now.
I'm going up.

01:34.083 --> 01:37.458
With any luck, cops haven't figured out
which room he came from.

01:37.541 --> 01:40.458
-You try to track down Owen.
-Are you insane?

01:40.541 --> 01:45.166
Nyland was clear. Protect the agency.
That means scrub the room.

02:11.208 --> 02:12.041
Owen?

02:12.875 --> 02:17.541
Please call me and just tell me
what's going on, okay? Please.

02:24.208 --> 02:25.583
All right, this is bad.

02:26.500 --> 02:30.000
If you really did see Owen
and he was running away...

02:30.666 --> 02:33.000
I mean, did he--?

02:35.083 --> 02:38.041
-Is that guy dead because--?
-No. No way.

02:41.375 --> 02:43.958
-I mean, not on purpose.

02:47.291 --> 02:49.666
Linus says the CIA staffers
are attached to embassies

02:49.750 --> 02:51.291
for their covers overseas.

02:51.375 --> 02:55.291
-That's where we should go, right?
-Think I wanna hang around here?

03:20.125 --> 03:23.958
The cops are on their way.
I tried texting you, you didn't answer.

03:24.041 --> 03:26.583
-What's happening?
-You don't need to know.

03:29.750 --> 03:33.125
-Any luck connecting with our guy?
-No, his phone keeps going to voicemail.

03:34.291 --> 03:37.666
If he's smart, he dumped it. Last thing
he wants is somebody tracking him.

03:37.750 --> 03:39.583
Yeah. We need to get to the consulate.

03:50.583 --> 03:52.666
You got a CIA officer killed.

03:53.208 --> 03:54.833
I didn't. His dick did.

03:59.708 --> 04:02.458
You signed his death warrant
when you handed over the photos.

04:02.541 --> 04:04.666
I can't believe I bought your spiel.

04:04.750 --> 04:07.833
How we'd be safer if operational support
didn't know where we were.

04:07.916 --> 04:10.458
You didn't wanna be standing
next to Xander

04:10.541 --> 04:13.750
-when they threw him out of a window.
-I did what I had to do.

04:13.833 --> 04:17.208
It was my only path back to Belarus
since you fucked up getting my money.

04:17.291 --> 04:19.666
Okay, if your plan was to kill Xander...

04:20.625 --> 04:24.166
-why are we on the run?
-Kirill is fast, but not that fast.

04:27.291 --> 04:28.291
What do you mean?

04:31.125 --> 04:33.916
There is a possibility
Xander wasn't the target.

04:34.708 --> 04:38.000
That the assassin was there
to kill me or us,

04:38.875 --> 04:41.000
that he was just wrong place, wrong time.

04:45.875 --> 04:49.000
Do you really think I saw Hannah?
Outside the hotel?

04:50.666 --> 04:53.291
-Well, you better hope not.
-Why?

04:55.208 --> 04:57.125
Because people are being killed.

05:14.875 --> 05:16.958
<i>-Pridurok,</i> your phone.
-Wait.

05:17.041 --> 05:18.458
Wait, wait, wait. No--

05:21.708 --> 05:23.625
Your phone is a tracking device.

05:24.750 --> 05:27.583
Do you want the person who killed Xander
to be able to find us?

05:27.666 --> 05:31.750
Let me answer that for you. No.
That is why I left my phone in Geneva.

05:34.041 --> 05:35.666
You didn't have to throw it out.

05:35.750 --> 05:38.958
We are radio silent until I say otherwise.
Do you understand?

06:16.708 --> 06:19.041
<i>What kind of minor league operation</i>
<i>are you running?</i>

06:19.125 --> 06:22.375
<i>I slip off to Florida to catch a marlin</i>
<i>or two, everything goes to hell?</i>

06:22.458 --> 06:26.416
<i>This was a simple supply run</i>
<i>before the asset was placed in country.</i>

06:26.500 --> 06:29.291
<i>What happened to Xander Goi</i>
<i>is a tragedy, but--</i>

06:29.375 --> 06:33.416
It's a fucking fiasco. What were
so many of your lawyers doing there?

06:33.500 --> 06:36.125
This phase involved
sanctioned bank accounts.

06:36.208 --> 06:38.416
So I sent Kitchens and Ebner to help.

06:38.500 --> 06:40.666
Did any of them happen to see
who killed my guy?

06:40.750 --> 06:42.083
That would have been helpful.

06:42.166 --> 06:45.208
Sir, we have no evidence yet
that points to who took out our CO.

06:45.291 --> 06:49.000
Hendricks and the asset
were clear of the location at the time.

06:49.083 --> 06:52.791
Or the asset killed Goi
and we'll find the new kid in a ditch.

06:54.500 --> 06:55.666
My money's on that.

06:55.750 --> 06:59.291
I made certain there was nothing in the
asset's room to identify the occupants.

06:59.375 --> 07:02.791
I'm in the process of pulling security
footage from in and around the hotel.

07:02.875 --> 07:04.958
Still no contact
from Hendricks or the asset?

07:05.041 --> 07:09.166
No. They may have gone quiet until they
can contact us from a secure location.

07:09.250 --> 07:13.458
<i>Since we got lawyers all over this,</i>
<i>tell me what's our legal exposure?</i>

07:13.541 --> 07:16.458
Ebner, you're handling the media scrub
from the consulate?

07:16.541 --> 07:17.791
<i> That's right, sir.</i>

07:17.875 --> 07:21.291
How Goi was papered, there's no reason
an agency connection would be made.

07:21.375 --> 07:22.458
Okay, um...

07:25.958 --> 07:29.250
Gilbane, shut down your op.
Focus on finding your asset.

07:29.333 --> 07:30.875
Sir, that's not necessary.

07:30.958 --> 07:33.500
Not necessary?
Your eyes and ears are dead.

07:33.583 --> 07:36.708
For all you know, your asset tipped
her hand and now your op is blown.

07:36.791 --> 07:39.833
Or my asset is still in play
and Goi's death is unrelated,

07:39.916 --> 07:43.750
<i>which means there's no need to terminate.</i>
<i>Before we pull the plug,</i>

07:43.833 --> 07:46.708
we need to do everything
to save this operation.

07:46.791 --> 07:49.958
This asset has unique access
to General Kuznetsov.

07:50.041 --> 07:51.625
<i>If we land her back in his orbit,</i>

07:51.708 --> 07:55.250
<i>it will be the biggest</i>
<i>Russian intelligence coup in 40 years.</i>

07:56.708 --> 07:58.916
<i>-How much time do you need?</i>
<i>-Twenty-four hours.</i>

07:59.000 --> 08:03.375
<i>If I don't have the asset by then,</i>
<i>we'll dump the op, go into cleanup mode.</i>

08:07.958 --> 08:10.208
You have a day,
but you're down a field operative.

08:10.291 --> 08:12.916
I'm putting Kitchens on operations duty
until this is over.

08:13.000 --> 08:16.833
Mr. Kitchens can't take off his lawyer hat
when it's convenient.

08:16.916 --> 08:20.291
I'm certain Lester understands
that in this time of crisis

08:20.375 --> 08:25.291
the agency needs him to be a CO regardless
of whether it jeopardizes his new career.

08:25.375 --> 08:27.041
Isn't that right, Kitchens?

08:28.375 --> 08:29.833
Don't do it.

08:29.916 --> 08:31.083
Yes, sir.

08:31.166 --> 08:33.916
<i>Good. Everyone who isn't Kitchens</i>
<i>or Gilbane, meeting's over.</i>

08:34.000 --> 08:35.791
-Sir--
<i>-That includes General Counsel.</i>

08:41.208 --> 08:42.041
<i>Okay.</i>

08:45.791 --> 08:48.958
I agree that Kuznetsov
is a priority one target.

08:49.041 --> 08:51.708
<i>We need to get an asset</i>
<i>next to the general.</i>

08:51.791 --> 08:54.416
<i>If it's not one of yours,</i>
<i>we need to move on.</i>

08:54.500 --> 08:57.458
If it comes down
to losing this opportunity altogether

08:57.541 --> 09:01.291
or cutting our losses and starting over,
burn the current players, understood?

09:05.875 --> 09:06.708
Understood.

09:06.791 --> 09:09.833
Now someone do me a favor,
who the fuck is Owen Hendricks?

09:19.291 --> 09:20.875
-Owen?
-What? What?

09:22.375 --> 09:25.083
We're clear to call in.
Get the nun's phone.

09:26.708 --> 09:27.916
Get the nun's phone.

09:31.666 --> 09:34.416
You don't think we have enough bad luck?
We'll rob a nun now?

09:34.500 --> 09:35.583
Just get it.

09:38.416 --> 09:39.250
Fine.

09:40.166 --> 09:41.000
Okay.

09:59.500 --> 10:01.208
<i>Hello.</i>
-Did I wake you?

10:03.375 --> 10:06.333
-I take it you cleared the border?
-<i>We did.</i>

10:06.833 --> 10:09.708
We're ready to come home. Is it safe?

10:11.375 --> 10:12.208
It is.

10:13.500 --> 10:15.000
<i>You remember the address?</i>

10:15.083 --> 10:17.875
I do, if it's where we debriefed
during Butcher.

10:21.291 --> 10:22.625
Can't wait to see you.

10:33.875 --> 10:35.125
Hey. Sorry.

10:37.250 --> 10:40.708
Um, I gotta use the--
I'll return the phone.

10:42.250 --> 10:45.208
-So you don't go to hell when you die?
-Better safe than sorry.

11:32.791 --> 11:33.625
What?

11:33.708 --> 11:34.916
It's me.

11:35.000 --> 11:38.666
-You're in trouble. I'm hanging up.
-<i>Hold on. I got an offer you can't refuse.</i>

11:38.750 --> 11:40.750
Something that could save you, us.

11:44.500 --> 11:45.458
What is it?

11:45.541 --> 11:48.875
<i>I have in my possession</i>
<i>high-level Russian intelligence.</i>

11:49.458 --> 11:52.125
I stole a notebook
from Max's safe deposit box,

11:52.208 --> 11:55.041
but there's a chance
I won't be able to hold onto it.

11:55.125 --> 11:57.125
I'm about to e-mail you pictures of it.

11:57.208 --> 12:01.125
No, don't. Don't. Otherwise,
they could be found during discovery.

12:01.208 --> 12:02.041
<i>Right.</i>

12:03.791 --> 12:07.458
Okay, I'm gonna save the pictures
to my Instagram draft folder.

12:07.541 --> 12:11.125
You'll get into my account,
download them, then delete them.

12:11.208 --> 12:14.708
-My password is 123LFG.
-Of course it is.

12:14.791 --> 12:16.875
There has got to be some way

12:17.375 --> 12:20.791
for you to use these
to muddy the waters on our scandal.

12:23.208 --> 12:26.083
-Holy shit, I think I know what to do.

12:26.166 --> 12:29.250
It's the end of the line.
We've gotta go steal a car.

12:29.333 --> 12:30.875
-<i>Yeah.</i>
-I didn't hear that.

12:31.416 --> 12:34.166
Yes, he was, in fact,
one of ours.

12:34.250 --> 12:39.375
I need you to confirm to the Swiss police
that he was a Commerce Department attaché,

12:39.458 --> 12:41.541
which is what it says
on the ID they found.

12:41.625 --> 12:43.125
Hey, there you are.

12:43.208 --> 12:44.916
I'm busy doing lawyer things,

12:45.000 --> 12:47.083
I'll let you know
if I need anything extracted.

12:48.833 --> 12:49.875
Wow.

12:52.125 --> 12:53.375
Next action item.

12:53.458 --> 12:57.583
You'll insist the Swiss authorities
run any leads or suspects by you,

12:57.666 --> 12:59.500
i.e., me, first.

13:00.208 --> 13:03.541
There are two American citizens here
who need emergency assistance.

13:03.625 --> 13:04.875
What's the emergency?

13:04.958 --> 13:08.041
They say their friend was at a hotel
where someone was murdered.

13:08.125 --> 13:11.625
-Does this friend have a name?
-Yes, Owen something.

13:22.833 --> 13:27.583
Good morning. Can you tell me
how you're associated with Mr. Hendricks?

13:27.666 --> 13:29.166
He's our roommate in D.C.

13:29.250 --> 13:30.375
Oh...

13:30.458 --> 13:32.166
Have you been in Geneva long?

13:32.250 --> 13:34.791
-Nope, we basically just got here.
-Oh.

13:35.333 --> 13:38.958
-You came out here to meet Mr. Hendricks?
-No, he didn't know we were coming.

13:39.791 --> 13:41.750
But I don't see how that matters.

13:41.833 --> 13:44.666
Someone was murdered,
and now we can't find him.

13:44.750 --> 13:46.458
So what brought you out here?

13:49.458 --> 13:52.583
I think you're missing the point.
This isn't about us.

13:52.666 --> 13:56.166
Our friend is missing
and you don't seem to be alarmed.

13:56.250 --> 13:57.958
Is there a supervisor we can talk to?

13:58.041 --> 14:00.916
There are hundreds of guests at the hotel.

14:01.000 --> 14:04.125
So why do you think
your friend is in trouble?

14:07.875 --> 14:09.958
Because he works for the CIA.

14:14.375 --> 14:16.541
So do I.

14:17.958 --> 14:21.083
-With Owen, in fact.
-Why didn't you just say that?

14:21.166 --> 14:24.083
Why did you follow a CIA officer
around the world?

14:25.000 --> 14:26.875
Like I said, we were concerned.

14:26.958 --> 14:31.166
You were concerned before the incident
at the hotel? That's interesting.

14:31.750 --> 14:34.458
Did he tell you
about what he was doing here

14:34.541 --> 14:37.958
or what he does on his work trips
or what he does at the agency?

14:38.041 --> 14:41.041
-He never talks about work.
-Why are you worried about this trip

14:41.125 --> 14:43.041
when you haven't been worried
about others?

14:43.125 --> 14:45.416
Was there something
about what he was doing here?

14:45.500 --> 14:48.125
Like I said, he doesn't tell us anything.

14:49.208 --> 14:51.291
Who besides me knows you're here?

14:51.375 --> 14:55.833
My mother, who's got half of D.C.
on speed dial, including your boss.

14:55.916 --> 14:59.208
How about giving us answers
instead of interrogating us?

15:00.333 --> 15:01.166
Well...

15:03.083 --> 15:04.958
I wish I had answers for you.

15:05.041 --> 15:08.125
But at the moment,
we don't know where Owen is either.

15:09.416 --> 15:11.250
Which is why I was asking the questions.

15:12.000 --> 15:14.875
But I'd be happy to reach out
if I find out anything.

15:14.958 --> 15:17.375
-Please do.
-That mean we're free to go?

15:18.708 --> 15:19.541
Of course.

15:21.166 --> 15:22.291
But some advice.

15:23.416 --> 15:24.250
Go home.

15:24.833 --> 15:26.500
The agency is all over this.

15:36.500 --> 15:38.458
You can blame me for coming here.

15:39.208 --> 15:41.041
We were questioned by the CIA.

15:42.125 --> 15:44.666
It feels like
you're not understanding that.

15:45.416 --> 15:47.083
Our names are now in a file.

15:47.166 --> 15:49.375
-We didn't do anything wrong.
-It doesn't matter.

15:51.375 --> 15:53.041
Need I remind you, you and I

15:53.125 --> 15:55.625
are not in the same position
when viewed by authorities.

15:59.000 --> 16:00.416
I'm sorry. You're right.

16:01.791 --> 16:04.125
Look, we have to face the facts that...

16:05.416 --> 16:07.916
Owen, he might be in some real trouble.

16:09.541 --> 16:12.750
And instead of helping,
we've unintentionally created more.

16:19.458 --> 16:21.375
-Who are you calling?
-My mother.

16:21.958 --> 16:23.333
So do you understand?

16:24.291 --> 16:27.125
Print the pages I sent you and plant them.

16:28.750 --> 16:33.333
How does a bunch of Russki scribbles
help with our rocket situation?

16:33.833 --> 16:35.416
<i>You know Havana Syndrome?</i>

16:35.500 --> 16:39.750
Pulsed radio frequency attacks
giving our diplomats concussions in Cuba,

16:39.833 --> 16:42.166
<i>China, Vietnam and Australia?</i>

16:42.250 --> 16:43.208
-Yeah.
-<i>Yeah.</i>

16:43.291 --> 16:45.500
<i>The scribbles from the notebook pages</i>

16:45.583 --> 16:49.541
confirmed they are courtesy
of Russian military intelligence.

16:50.458 --> 16:52.125
<i>Here's what you're gonna do.</i>

16:52.208 --> 16:56.083
Find these pages at the
Nigerian compound you're about to raid.

16:56.166 --> 16:58.125
Now, I want it on helmet cam,

16:58.208 --> 17:02.416
I want you to find them tucked
in some crevice like the Holy Grail.

17:02.500 --> 17:04.916
Copy that. Mission is the pages.

17:05.000 --> 17:07.708
Exactly. And then, amazing coinkidink,

17:07.791 --> 17:11.916
you also find the anti-tank rockets
you lost in the same place,

17:12.000 --> 17:14.916
and you destroy them
because they're unstable.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.250
Poof.

17:16.916 --> 17:21.416
-We blow up the notebook pages too?
-No. No! No. You bring me the pages.

17:21.500 --> 17:24.500
I wave them around,
an incredible intelligence coup,

17:24.583 --> 17:28.666
and nobody gives two shits why our rockets
ended up in the hands of Boko Haram.

17:28.750 --> 17:31.750
God help me,
you'll be a fucking hero.

17:31.833 --> 17:35.708
Copy that. Where did you find
the notebook pages anyway?

17:37.166 --> 17:38.458
Fuck you! I didn't.

17:38.541 --> 17:40.250
You did, at the compound.

17:41.291 --> 17:42.125
Copy that.

17:46.583 --> 17:48.583
Oh, fuck.

17:49.250 --> 17:52.166
-Mom, please.
-<i>I still don't understand.</i>

17:52.250 --> 17:54.958
<i>You think Owen's been arrested,</i>
<i>hurt, or what?</i>

17:55.041 --> 17:58.083
He's not answering his phone,
and he disappeared.

17:58.166 --> 18:03.916
I told you what happened at the consulate.
Can you just use some of your contacts

18:04.000 --> 18:07.416
<i>and make phone calls</i>
<i>to find out where he is, if he's okay?</i>

18:07.500 --> 18:10.000
Honey, people who have that clearance
take it seriously.

18:10.083 --> 18:12.583
<i>No one wants to wind up</i>
<i>like Scooter Libby.</i>

18:12.666 --> 18:15.208
Scooter Libby
is playing golf at Mar-a-Lago.

18:16.458 --> 18:19.833
Please. Okay, just make a few phone calls.

18:21.083 --> 18:23.458
Owen doesn't matter to anyone except me.

18:27.541 --> 18:31.000
Okay. I will look into this
on one condition.

18:31.083 --> 18:33.208
<i>You will move out of that apartment.</i>

18:33.291 --> 18:36.416
<i>-I don't want you involved in Owen's life.</i>
-Mom!

18:36.500 --> 18:39.666
<i>No. I'm tired</i>
<i>of him constantly derailing you.</i>

18:39.750 --> 18:41.250
This is non-negotiable.

18:45.333 --> 18:46.166
Fine.

18:46.666 --> 18:50.916
<i>Also, I'm buying two tickets for you</i>
<i>and Terence to come home. Coach.</i>

18:51.000 --> 18:53.916
Consider it your punishment
for being so reckless.

19:10.333 --> 19:13.666
-I'm going to tell you Dawn's secret.
-What? Why?

19:14.166 --> 19:19.083
If the agency thinks Xander's death has
compromised putting me back in Belarus,

19:19.166 --> 19:21.708
then I become useless to them
and Dawn kills me.

19:21.791 --> 19:25.166
But if I tell you her secret,
then she will have to kill us both.

19:25.250 --> 19:27.500
-Yeah. No, I'm good. Thank you.
-Owen--

19:27.583 --> 19:31.791
On the list of things I don't wanna know,
shit that gets me killed is at the top.

19:31.875 --> 19:33.083
Stop being a child.

19:33.166 --> 19:35.041
-I'm not being a child.
-Dawn--

19:35.125 --> 19:37.291
-No, don't-- Stop--

19:38.291 --> 19:40.625
Dawn is running ghost assets
and pocketing the money.

19:40.708 --> 19:43.041
I don't know what that means.
I'm still in the dark.

19:45.500 --> 19:49.625
Every asset gets paid depending
on the level of intelligence they provide.

19:49.708 --> 19:54.833
Dawn created high-level fake assets
and stole the money the CIA sent for them.

19:57.083 --> 19:58.750
-That is super illegal.
-Yes.

19:59.916 --> 20:03.208
And now I have a legal responsibility
to inform my boss.

20:03.291 --> 20:07.458
You didn't inform your boss
of all the illegal shit you and I did.

20:09.916 --> 20:13.333
As long as Dawn plays nice,
we keep her secret.

20:18.916 --> 20:21.583
Sir, the White House chief of staff
is here.

20:21.666 --> 20:23.583
-You mean on the phone?
-No, sir.

20:23.666 --> 20:24.666
-He's here.
-Shit.

20:26.166 --> 20:28.416
-Kevin. Nice surprise.

20:33.583 --> 20:36.833
Why the hell am I getting calls
about Owen Hendricks?

20:36.916 --> 20:38.666
I don't-- Calls from who?

20:38.750 --> 20:41.791
From a lobbyist
who says a CIA operation in Geneva

20:41.875 --> 20:44.875
has gone sideways
and a CIA lawyer's gone missing.

20:46.416 --> 20:48.625
What kind of leaky ship
are you running here?

20:49.208 --> 20:53.458
First, I resent the implication
that whatever issue D.O. might be having

20:53.541 --> 20:54.750
is somehow my fault.

20:55.333 --> 20:57.375
Secondly, do you really wanna be briefed?

20:57.458 --> 20:58.500
Of course not.

20:58.583 --> 21:02.791
But my previous conversations with
Hendricks about a certain former asset

21:02.875 --> 21:04.583
leaves me a little pregnant.

21:10.333 --> 21:12.291
There was an operation in Geneva.

21:13.000 --> 21:15.708
The first phase,
returning a former asset into the field.

21:16.375 --> 21:17.458
Things went wrong.

21:19.083 --> 21:22.625
Case officer was killed,
Hendricks and the asset are missing.

21:25.625 --> 21:27.125
Who was the case officer?

21:27.791 --> 21:28.666
Xander Goi.

21:35.666 --> 21:37.416
You keep this away from me.

21:37.500 --> 21:39.583
No reason to believe it'll get near you,

21:39.666 --> 21:41.750
unless there's something
you're not telling me.

21:41.833 --> 21:45.541
Not telling each other shit
is literally in our job description.

21:47.875 --> 21:53.000
My contact with Hendricks was incidental.
It doesn't ever need to be mentioned.

21:54.666 --> 21:55.500
Are we clear?

21:57.375 --> 22:00.000
-Kevin?
-Are we clear?

22:03.625 --> 22:04.791
-Yes.
-Great.

22:05.875 --> 22:06.916
I was never here.

22:27.500 --> 22:28.458
What's with the guns?

22:28.541 --> 22:32.500
Till we know what happened to Goi,
we have to treat you as hostiles.

22:33.625 --> 22:34.666
No hard feelings.

22:36.458 --> 22:38.208
What the fuck? Hey. Yo.

22:41.291 --> 22:43.375
Ow! Shit. Fuck!

22:45.583 --> 22:46.416
I know you.

22:46.500 --> 22:48.291
-Yeah, what's up, buddy?
-Shit.

22:52.541 --> 22:55.125
I'm telling Nyland about this.
You're way out of line.

22:55.208 --> 22:57.750
Park him in darkness
till I'm ready for him.

23:00.083 --> 23:03.458
Oh, fuck. Come on, man.
You can't be this stupid.

23:04.291 --> 23:07.708
Maybe nobody gives a shit about Meladze,
but I work at the OGC.

23:08.375 --> 23:09.666
Relax, hotshot.

23:10.541 --> 23:13.541
As long as you're not a problem,
this will all work out.

23:14.208 --> 23:16.583
Can't be a coincidence that you're here.

23:16.666 --> 23:19.583
Dawn made a request
since you and I go way back.

23:19.666 --> 23:21.750
Plus, this op has extra hazard pay,

23:21.833 --> 23:24.916
which is sweet since you made me
sign away half my fucking salary.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.958
That money goes to your wife and kids.

23:28.333 --> 23:29.166
Ex-wife.

23:34.625 --> 23:37.541
And I'm not sure
the rugrats are even mine.

23:42.666 --> 23:44.625
Do we really need all this drama?

23:45.875 --> 23:47.833
Can't you come cut me loose?

23:47.916 --> 23:50.625
We can open a bottle,
talk about what happened.

23:53.291 --> 23:54.125
Nah.

23:56.500 --> 23:57.958
I like the drama.

23:59.166 --> 24:00.500
And I don't trust you.

24:07.208 --> 24:08.041
Fair enough.

24:09.708 --> 24:11.083
Then let's get into it.

24:12.083 --> 24:16.958
Xander Goi's death had nothing
to do with me or our operation.

24:17.708 --> 24:20.083
He was killed
for fucking the wrong man's wife.

24:20.166 --> 24:22.541
I'd love to believe that. Why should I?

24:22.625 --> 24:25.791
Because the person
whose wife he was fucking

24:25.875 --> 24:29.208
is a high-level Russian mobster
who runs Geneva.

24:31.791 --> 24:36.041
And yesterday,
I gave him photos of Xander in the act.

24:38.000 --> 24:39.000
That's cold, Max.

24:39.875 --> 24:40.708
Even for you.

24:41.291 --> 24:42.708
I don't see you weeping.

24:43.958 --> 24:45.041
Why did you do it?

24:45.125 --> 24:47.083
The lawyer fucked my money.

24:47.958 --> 24:51.250
It was the only thing I had worth enough
to get me that meeting with Lev.

24:51.333 --> 24:55.583
You just confessed to being responsible
for a CIA officer's death.

24:56.083 --> 24:57.916
How does that help save our op?

24:58.000 --> 25:00.833
Because you're going
to leave that part out.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.125
Why would I do that?

25:02.208 --> 25:06.583
Because you want to become
Moscow station chief.

25:07.833 --> 25:12.500
And the only way that happens
is if this operation is a success.

25:12.583 --> 25:14.458
Otherwise, you've run a failed mission,

25:14.541 --> 25:17.750
got a fellow case officer killed,
which means

25:17.833 --> 25:21.958
you'll be lucky if they give you a desk
in some forgotten CIA basement.

25:26.750 --> 25:28.291
What does the lawyer know?

25:28.375 --> 25:31.458
That keeping his mouth shut
is in his best interest.

25:32.208 --> 25:33.750
You have dirt on him too?

25:46.833 --> 25:49.375
I'm starting to get
a real sense of déjà vu.

25:49.458 --> 25:50.500
Yeah, me too.

25:51.208 --> 25:54.625
That mean we can skip the conversation
where I tell you not to make a thing

25:54.708 --> 25:56.458
of a standard mission safety protocol?

25:56.541 --> 26:00.125
Is that what you call zip-tying
and assaulting an agency lawyer?

26:00.208 --> 26:04.333
It's what I call doing what was necessary
to protect an agency operation.

26:04.416 --> 26:07.750
-Now, if you're done being delicate,

26:08.458 --> 26:09.916
can I tell you the good news?

26:10.875 --> 26:12.791
You decided to retire
with the other replicants.

26:12.875 --> 26:14.833
We are about to get
on a call with Langley,

26:14.916 --> 26:18.291
where we will recommend to the director
that our operation should proceed

26:18.375 --> 26:21.041
because Goi's death was unconnected.

26:23.541 --> 26:26.000
Is that what you believe,
or what you wanna believe?

26:26.500 --> 26:30.166
It's what we both believe,
unless you plan not to back me up.

26:33.500 --> 26:34.333
<i>Mr. Hendricks.</i>

26:34.416 --> 26:36.583
You had people very worried.

26:36.666 --> 26:38.291
Yes, sir. I apologize.

26:38.375 --> 26:40.166
Given the death of the asset's handler,

26:40.250 --> 26:43.583
I felt it was prudent to go dark
until we knew if we were compromised.

26:43.666 --> 26:46.458
<i>Are you saying Goi's death</i>
<i>wasn't connected to your operation?</i>

26:49.333 --> 26:50.958
That is the working theory.

26:51.458 --> 26:53.291
I'm sorry to say we have HUMINT

26:53.375 --> 26:56.916
that Goi was killed for having an affair
with the wife of a Russian criminal.

26:57.416 --> 26:59.000
<i> Sir, I can confirm that.</i>

26:59.083 --> 27:02.458
I managed to pull security footage
from the hotel and surrounding streets.

27:02.541 --> 27:05.791
Facial recognition pinged
this woman, Nichka Lashin.

27:07.625 --> 27:10.250
<i>Intel pegs her</i>
<i>as a Russian mafia enforcer.</i>

27:10.333 --> 27:12.875
I saw her outside our hotel
before we left.

27:13.375 --> 27:14.958
Nyland, what do you think?

27:16.083 --> 27:19.291
-It's your call.
-Way to hedge your bets with the boss.

27:19.375 --> 27:22.333
Okay, I am satisfied
the op can proceed as planned.

27:22.416 --> 27:23.791
What are our next steps?

27:23.875 --> 27:26.791
We go to Prague with the asset
to make the buy-in.

27:26.875 --> 27:29.833
In success,
my team clears the path of obstacles,

27:29.916 --> 27:31.458
then we return her to Belarus.

27:32.375 --> 27:34.333
Try to avoid any more fuck-ups.

27:34.416 --> 27:35.416
Yes, sir.

27:36.625 --> 27:39.250
Okay, my turn.
Salazar, Hendricks stay here.

27:39.333 --> 27:40.750
Everybody else, go away.

27:50.750 --> 27:53.958
I got a very unwelcome visit today
from the White House chief of staff.

27:54.458 --> 27:56.791
-Someone called him about you.
-Sir...

27:56.875 --> 27:58.708
<i>This person, a lobbyist,</i>

27:58.791 --> 28:00.458
wanted to know if you were safe.

28:01.208 --> 28:03.541
Seemed to know things
had gone badly where you are.

28:04.375 --> 28:07.416
I take it from your reaction
you know who called?

28:07.500 --> 28:08.625
<i>Hannah's mom.</i>

28:09.500 --> 28:10.333
<i>Hannah's my...</i>

28:11.625 --> 28:13.958
<i>My roommate.</i>
<i>I'm pretty sure that she came to Geneva</i>

28:14.041 --> 28:18.000
<i>-because she was worried about me.</i>
-I can confirm she was concerned.

28:19.250 --> 28:22.666
I went to Owen's apartment
to help with the sanction SNAFU.

28:25.000 --> 28:27.708
When this is over,
you're both gonna take a refresher course

28:27.791 --> 28:30.416
in keeping your damn mouths shut.

28:30.500 --> 28:31.875
-Yes, sir.
-<i> Yes, sir.</i>

28:32.541 --> 28:35.083
Do I need to tell you
to remain radio silent

28:35.166 --> 28:37.916
-until this operation is complete?
-No, sir.

28:38.750 --> 28:42.416
And if I hear about any more calls
being made on your behalf...

28:43.208 --> 28:44.083
you're fired.

28:45.166 --> 28:46.291
Is that understood?

28:47.250 --> 28:48.083
Yes, sir.

28:55.208 --> 28:56.500
<i>Owen is fine.</i>

28:56.583 --> 28:57.791
-Are you sure?
<i>-Yes.</i>

28:57.875 --> 29:00.291
<i>I got it from the chief of staff himself.</i>

29:00.375 --> 29:02.500
<i>Owen is in the middle</i>
<i>of something sensitive,</i>

29:02.583 --> 29:06.708
<i>which is why he's not calling you back.</i>
<i>Now, get your ass on the plane.</i>

29:11.333 --> 29:12.166
Owen's fine.

29:13.000 --> 29:14.125
Thank God.

29:14.208 --> 29:15.041
Now, let's go.

29:23.708 --> 29:25.500
You're not coming, are you?

29:27.083 --> 29:27.916
No.

29:30.166 --> 29:31.458
I mean, I can't.

29:32.791 --> 29:35.833
If I'm this unhappy now,
where am I gonna be in five years?

29:36.333 --> 29:38.833
Or how much harder will it be
to make a change then?

29:39.916 --> 29:43.083
I could think of a lot worse places
to have a quarter-life crisis.

29:43.791 --> 29:45.625
Privilege has its privileges.

29:46.541 --> 29:50.625
Well, if you're gonna do
this emotional audit, don't stop halfway.

29:53.458 --> 29:56.625
You need to figure out
how you really feel about Owen.

29:56.708 --> 29:57.541
Yeah.

29:57.625 --> 30:01.083
Because you can't move forward
until you do. Come here.

30:08.541 --> 30:09.375
You got this.

30:09.916 --> 30:10.750
Be safe.

30:46.875 --> 30:47.750
Wow.

30:48.958 --> 30:49.958
Oh, this is sick.

30:50.041 --> 30:51.291
Don't touch anything.

30:52.875 --> 30:55.791
This is our mobile ops center.
You'll ride in this

30:56.500 --> 30:58.791
while we drive to Prague
for the meeting with Lev.

30:58.875 --> 31:02.458
-What's this?
-That is an RQ-4 Global Hawk drone

31:02.541 --> 31:05.083
currently taking off
from Ramstein Air Base.

31:05.166 --> 31:07.250
It's being piloted by a kid
sitting in a bunker

31:07.333 --> 31:09.000
underneath the Las Vegas Strip.

31:10.166 --> 31:12.958
It'll provide tactical surveillance
for Max's meeting with Lev

31:13.041 --> 31:16.125
while my team
provides boots-on-the-ground security.

31:24.583 --> 31:26.875
<i> JAG1, RAQ4 is on site.</i>

31:34.000 --> 31:36.250
<i>I see you landing at the staging area.</i>

31:45.333 --> 31:48.041
We're gonna move into position.
When I give the "all clear,"

31:48.125 --> 31:50.916
you're gonna get into the car,
drive to your meeting with Lev.

31:51.000 --> 31:52.541
We will provide overwatch.

31:52.625 --> 31:55.416
When the deal is done,
you'll get out of there.

31:55.500 --> 31:57.666
-Give me a gun.
-They're gonna take it away.

31:57.750 --> 32:00.458
Then give me two.
I'll put the first where they can find it.

32:02.458 --> 32:04.958
The goal is to not shoot anyone.

32:05.041 --> 32:07.625
Bullets start flying
and we came all this way for nothing.

32:07.708 --> 32:09.500
Put this in your pocket. There's a mic.

32:09.583 --> 32:11.875
It's active
so we can listen in on what's going on.

32:16.541 --> 32:18.708
If things go badly,
you're gonna come rescue me.

32:19.583 --> 32:20.416
Of course.

32:21.791 --> 32:23.666
Hey. What am I doing?

32:23.750 --> 32:24.666
You're with me.

32:25.625 --> 32:28.333
-Seriously?
-No, you stay in the fucking truck.

32:29.208 --> 32:30.041
Let's go!

32:49.666 --> 32:50.583
You nervous?

32:51.666 --> 32:53.125
No. I'm terrified.

32:56.458 --> 32:59.208
There's even odds Lev will kill me
once I give him the money,

32:59.291 --> 33:01.041
but there's no other way home, so...

33:05.791 --> 33:06.625
Go.

33:15.041 --> 33:16.791
We're in position. You're a go.

33:20.250 --> 33:22.083
I'll see you on the other side.

33:22.791 --> 33:23.916
Okay. Yeah.

34:59.291 --> 35:01.541
Kirill sent me your bounty.

35:01.625 --> 35:03.750
There's 7 million more in that case.

35:03.833 --> 35:05.333
That's serious money.

35:05.416 --> 35:07.666
Well, I'm serious about making amends.

35:10.125 --> 35:13.375
<i> You know, there are some that</i>

35:14.166 --> 35:18.291
won't let you come home
no matter how much money you give them.

35:18.375 --> 35:20.583
Well, that's my problem to deal with.

35:29.375 --> 35:31.750
<i>And what if they've already paid me</i>

35:31.833 --> 35:33.916
to leave your body out in the snow?

35:37.750 --> 35:39.541
Then I'd already be out there.

35:42.625 --> 35:45.125
So shall we talk terms?

35:51.833 --> 35:53.000
<i>Da.</i>

35:53.083 --> 35:54.625
Okay.

35:55.583 --> 35:56.416
Oh, jeez.

36:07.791 --> 36:09.875
<i>JAG1, I'm having a software glitch.</i>

36:11.083 --> 36:12.791
<i>You're flying solo while I reboot.</i>

36:12.875 --> 36:15.625
Roger that. Eyes peeled.
Eye of God closed.

36:36.750 --> 36:39.541
Who the fuck are these guys?

36:47.916 --> 36:50.416
Overwatch One. Come in, Overwatch One.

36:52.333 --> 36:54.208
Overwatch, we got a problem. Do you copy?

36:54.291 --> 36:56.208
Stay off this channel.

36:56.291 --> 36:58.416
We have a serious problem.
Do you not hear me?

36:58.500 --> 37:01.416
That's why you never bring a lawyer
on an op.

37:11.416 --> 37:12.250
Fuck.

37:52.375 --> 37:53.708
Shit.

38:13.875 --> 38:15.208
What the fuck is this?

38:15.875 --> 38:16.916
Fuck.

38:19.291 --> 38:23.000
I knew I couldn't trust you.

38:59.791 --> 39:01.125
RQ4,

39:01.208 --> 39:02.708
<i>I need you on-site now.</i>

39:03.750 --> 39:05.666
Yeah. Hi, I could use some help.

39:06.250 --> 39:07.125
<i>Where are you?</i>

39:07.208 --> 39:08.500
<i>Down here!</i>

39:10.750 --> 39:13.083
What the shit are you doing down there?

39:15.083 --> 39:18.916
JAG2, we got a friendly to protect.
You're weapons free.

39:19.541 --> 39:21.000
Let's fucking go!

41:56.625 --> 41:57.666
Fuck.

42:04.000 --> 42:04.833
Fuck.

42:24.250 --> 42:25.083
You got shot.

42:25.583 --> 42:26.791
Yeah, no shit.

42:29.625 --> 42:30.625
I killed someone.

42:32.166 --> 42:33.208
Oh, shit.

42:35.958 --> 42:36.791
Shit.

42:45.833 --> 42:46.666
Wait.

43:04.041 --> 43:04.875
Lev.

43:07.791 --> 43:08.625
Lev.

43:10.791 --> 43:11.625
Oh, God.

43:16.416 --> 43:17.916
I didn't do this.

43:24.291 --> 43:25.875
I didn't betray you.

43:26.708 --> 43:27.541
But...

43:28.541 --> 43:32.208
you'll never believe that,
which means if you live...

43:36.791 --> 43:38.250
then I don't get to go home.

43:39.041 --> 43:40.041
Max, no.

43:41.375 --> 43:42.208
No.

43:43.041 --> 43:44.500
And I'm going home.

43:51.583 --> 43:52.416
Let's go.

44:22.125 --> 44:24.541
<i> What was happening?</i>
<i>Who was shooting at the compound?</i>

44:25.125 --> 44:26.166
Owen!

44:26.250 --> 44:28.416
-Who was shooting at the compound?
-Nichka.

44:28.500 --> 44:29.875
-Nichka?
-Yeah.

44:29.958 --> 44:32.125
-How do you know her?
-I met her in Geneva.

44:32.208 --> 44:35.666
She was outside the hotel
that Xander got killed at.

44:35.750 --> 44:38.666
She was the one
who pushed the Council to kill me.

44:41.166 --> 44:42.416
I don't feel so good.

44:43.541 --> 44:46.541
Because you're in shock.
Just lie down for a minute.

44:46.625 --> 44:47.583
Close your eyes.

44:48.875 --> 44:50.208
Just rest and breathe.

44:53.583 --> 44:54.416
Just breathe.

45:18.333 --> 45:21.000
-Stop the car, Max.
-I'm not stopping the car.

45:21.083 --> 45:22.666
Stop the fucking car, Max.

45:22.750 --> 45:26.583
Stop the fucking car, Max! Fuck!

45:32.041 --> 45:33.750
What the fuck are you doing?

45:35.250 --> 45:36.666
I can't do this anymore.

45:38.500 --> 45:39.458
Look, I get it.

45:40.083 --> 45:42.000
Your first time, it's upsetting.

45:42.083 --> 45:45.666
Max, I pulled a trigger and a guy's head
came apart, and I can't stop seeing it.

45:45.750 --> 45:47.708
-That will pass.
-It's not the right answer.

45:47.791 --> 45:50.291
-That is what a psychopath says.
-Or a survivor.

45:50.375 --> 45:51.625
Same thing.

45:52.583 --> 45:53.625
Fuck.

45:53.708 --> 45:55.333
-Just get in the car.
-No!

45:55.416 --> 45:59.000
I quit. I'm through with you
and I'm through with the agency.

45:59.083 --> 45:59.916
Owen, stop.

46:05.291 --> 46:06.416
I said, stop.

46:26.041 --> 46:27.958
Oh, I have been so stupid.

46:33.500 --> 46:35.125
I thought I could save you.

46:37.000 --> 46:39.541
I thought
underneath this whole psychokiller

46:39.625 --> 46:43.666
that there was someone that
had actually suffered loss and tragedy,

46:44.625 --> 46:47.916
that was desperately alone and just,
I don't know, needed someone

46:48.000 --> 46:50.708
to fucking care about them.
I thought that I could help you.

46:51.500 --> 46:53.708
I thought if I helped you,
then you could change.

46:53.791 --> 46:55.041
But you can't change.

46:56.416 --> 47:00.375
Max, you have dug yourself
in so fucking deep, there's no way out.

47:00.458 --> 47:01.708
You are a prisoner...

47:03.291 --> 47:05.291
of this incessant need to survive.

47:08.333 --> 47:13.250
Just like I'm a prisoner
of my own self-sabotaging bullshit.

47:13.333 --> 47:14.166
Fuck.

47:16.208 --> 47:21.916
Dead dad, fucking manic mom,
as if that's an excuse to be so selfish,

47:22.583 --> 47:24.875
to hurt the people
that actually care about me. I--

47:29.791 --> 47:30.625
I need you.

47:32.416 --> 47:33.458
To get back home.

47:36.125 --> 47:37.750
After what just happened...

47:41.791 --> 47:42.625
Please.

47:43.958 --> 47:44.958
I can't.

47:49.208 --> 47:52.166
Max, if I don't get out now,
I'm gonna be lost forever. And you...

47:56.500 --> 47:57.708
Nobody can save you.

48:34.541 --> 48:36.083
-Hello?
-<i>Hannah.</i>

48:37.833 --> 48:38.666
Owen?

48:39.500 --> 48:40.333
Oh, my God.

48:40.916 --> 48:42.416
-Are you okay?
-Uh...

48:45.291 --> 48:47.333
I'm not sure.
I mean, nobody's shooting at me,

48:47.416 --> 48:48.333
<i>so that's good.</i>

48:50.250 --> 48:52.625
<i>I have made so many fucking bad choices.</i>

48:52.708 --> 48:56.208
Like, every decision I made
since I started working this job

48:56.291 --> 48:59.041
has been the wrong one,
including not listening when you said

48:59.125 --> 49:00.916
<i>that I was making bad choices.</i>

49:02.458 --> 49:03.875
<i>Are you still in Prague?</i>

49:06.750 --> 49:09.750
-How do you know I'm in Prague?
<i>-I'm here too.</i>

49:11.916 --> 49:13.833
I'm right near the war memorial.

49:14.958 --> 49:17.458
-I'll go there. Just come find me.
<i>-Okay.</i>

49:20.625 --> 49:23.708
Is this real?
Because, I swear, I'm so fucking tired.

49:24.708 --> 49:26.166
I feel like I could be dreaming.

49:27.416 --> 49:29.791
<i>It's real. I'm right here.</i>

49:29.875 --> 49:31.000
<i>It's gonna be okay.</i>

49:36.166 --> 49:37.000
Okay.

49:49.666 --> 49:53.000
-We have a problem.
-No shit. We're in full runaway mode.

49:53.541 --> 49:54.375
<i>No.</i>

49:54.458 --> 49:56.833
The lawyer is the problem.

50:01.083 --> 50:02.083
Are you with him?

50:02.166 --> 50:05.833
No. But I can track him
on the watch I gave him.

50:05.916 --> 50:08.916
<i>Good. I'm tracking you</i>
<i>through the phone I gave you.</i>

50:10.416 --> 50:11.625
See you in a minute.

50:38.541 --> 50:39.541
That was fast.

51:15.208 --> 51:16.166
What the--?

51:39.541 --> 51:40.375
God.

51:45.333 --> 51:46.166
Max.

51:48.416 --> 51:49.250
Where are we?

51:50.666 --> 51:52.666
-I don't know.
-Who has us?

52:03.750 --> 52:04.875
Karolina.

52:38.083 --> 52:38.916
Who are you?

52:41.333 --> 52:44.583
And what the fuck are you doing
running around with my mother?
