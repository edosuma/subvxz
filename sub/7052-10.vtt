00:01.284 --> 00:02.911
Previously on Fringe:

00:03.086 --> 00:04.781
They're calling these events
the Pattern.

00:04.954 --> 00:08.617
As if someone out there is experimenting,
only the whole world is their lab.

00:08.792 --> 00:13.058
- You're saying I can talk to John?
- You could access his memories.

00:13.229 --> 00:16.926
David Robert Jones was arrested
in possession of state secrets.

00:17.100 --> 00:21.594
The people I work with are loyal
to the end. Can you say the same?

00:21.938 --> 00:24.236
- Hello, Liv.
- You're not real.

00:24.407 --> 00:26.898
- What's happening?
- When you were in the tank...

00:27.077 --> 00:30.342
...part of his memories crossed over
into yours.

00:38.621 --> 00:40.486
Security camera's out. Disarming alarm.

00:42.258 --> 00:45.523
- Alarm disarmed.
- Roger, we're in.

00:47.000 --> 00:53.074

00:59.209 --> 01:01.973
- How we doing?
- Loop is up. You're good to go.

01:18.695 --> 01:20.185
- Hey, how we doing?
- Good to go.

01:20.363 --> 01:21.728
Okay. Powering up.

01:21.898 --> 01:26.995
Three, two, one, charge.

01:34.210 --> 01:36.804
- Oscillation's good.
- Ready to open the grid.

01:36.980 --> 01:39.676
- Where are we?
- Ninety-six percent.

01:39.849 --> 01:43.341
Ninety-eight. Resonance, set.

01:43.520 --> 01:45.385
Give me the grid.

01:47.423 --> 01:49.015
Careful.

01:58.535 --> 01:59.866
Magnet firm.

02:06.943 --> 02:11.209
- How long do we have?
- Confirming density and thickness.

02:11.381 --> 02:13.246
A minute, 41.

02:13.416 --> 02:14.906
- Forty.
- Let's go.

02:36.706 --> 02:38.264
Six-ten, six-ten, six-ten.

02:40.210 --> 02:41.802
Okay, I got it.

02:42.579 --> 02:44.046
Give me a charge gel.

02:51.287 --> 02:54.415
- Fifty-seven seconds.
- Oh, we gotta move.

03:01.965 --> 03:03.057
Thirty-five seconds.

03:06.202 --> 03:07.635
Get it up.

03:09.639 --> 03:12.301
- Get it over... Okay.
- I got it down.

03:12.475 --> 03:13.737
All right, let's move.

03:13.910 --> 03:15.741
Grab everything, and let's go.

03:16.813 --> 03:18.747
Let's go. I need help. Get it up.

03:21.084 --> 03:22.847
Okay, take it through.

03:39.669 --> 03:41.227
You got it?

03:42.105 --> 03:43.868
All right, I got it.

03:48.611 --> 03:50.943
They've gotta move,
or they're not gonna make it.

03:51.114 --> 03:52.342
Lugo, let's go.

03:52.515 --> 03:54.346
The magnet won't disengage.

03:54.517 --> 03:57.315
- Disengage it. We gotta go.
- You go. I'm working on it.

03:57.487 --> 03:59.148
I'm right behind you.

04:04.160 --> 04:06.185
Fifteen seconds.
What the hell is he doing?

04:06.362 --> 04:07.386
The magnet's stuck.

04:07.563 --> 04:10.555
- He can't leave that in there.
- I think he understands that.

04:13.536 --> 04:15.197
Come on.

04:18.141 --> 04:19.870
We got slack.

04:20.310 --> 04:22.210
Ten seconds, nine seconds...

04:22.912 --> 04:24.004
...eight, seven...

04:24.180 --> 04:26.978
I'm ready. Pull me through.
...six, five seconds...

04:27.150 --> 04:28.811
...four, three.

04:28.985 --> 04:31.818
- We've two seconds. Pull.
- Come on, push yourself through.

04:32.789 --> 04:35.314
All right, pull me through!

04:46.936 --> 04:49.530
Grab everything. Let's go.

04:54.844 --> 04:56.368
No.

04:56.546 --> 04:59.014
Help me. Please.

05:02.385 --> 05:04.046
Let's go.

05:05.088 --> 05:06.578
Let's go!

05:06.756 --> 05:09.122
Secure that gear.
I want nothing left behind.

05:41.891 --> 05:45.019
What do you mean you don't have
one? Everybody's got one. Even I.

05:45.194 --> 05:47.128
- What's that? A spleen?
- Yeah, a spleen.

05:47.296 --> 05:50.197
Unless one suffers from Asplenia,
a rare genetic condition...

05:50.366 --> 05:53.028
...in which one is born spleenless.
- Thank you, Walter.

05:53.202 --> 05:56.729
- You seriously don't have a best friend?
- Nope. Well, does a sister count?

05:56.906 --> 06:00.967
- Of course a sister doesn't count.
- Well, I've enjoyed being on my own.

06:01.144 --> 06:04.045
Even when I was at boarding school,
they used to call me Han.

06:04.213 --> 06:06.579
As in Solo? Cute.
At least you had a nickname.

06:06.749 --> 06:10.480
This is Phillip Broyles with Homeland
Security. Have him call me soon.

06:10.653 --> 06:12.917
- Yes, and they'll connect you.
- Oh.

06:13.122 --> 06:15.056
Clear the area, please.

06:17.560 --> 06:20.188
This is fascinating.

06:20.696 --> 06:23.563
Security guard was killed,
surveillance cameras disabled.

06:23.733 --> 06:25.223
- So, what do we have?
- Nothing.

06:25.401 --> 06:28.734
This may be related to a series
of robberies. This would be the third.

06:28.905 --> 06:31.840
- All in Philadelphia?
- First in Cleveland, second Baltimore.

06:32.008 --> 06:34.442
I was in Baltimore.
I remember a woman...

06:34.644 --> 06:36.578
...with particularly large breasts.

06:38.347 --> 06:42.374
Each time, the only thing taken has
been an oversized safe-deposit box.

06:42.552 --> 06:44.713
All without so much
as a breach to the vault.

06:44.887 --> 06:48.345
- Are the boxes traceable?
- I have a call in to the bank manager now.

06:48.524 --> 06:51.584
The who, what and why? That's you.

06:54.530 --> 06:57.522
Just when you thought things
couldn't get any weirder...

07:02.472 --> 07:04.872
Peter, I know this man.

07:05.041 --> 07:06.770
What, the guy in the wall?

07:06.943 --> 07:09.605
Really? Let me guess.
He's your best friend.

07:09.779 --> 07:13.146
- No, I mean it.
- You know him from where?

07:13.316 --> 07:16.911
To determine what happened here,
we'll have to cut him out of the wall.

07:17.086 --> 07:20.180
Or at least pieces of him.
I'll need some of this netting too.

07:20.456 --> 07:22.822
Raul. Raul Lugo.

07:22.992 --> 07:24.289
- You know this man?
- Yeah.

07:24.460 --> 07:27.623
- He was in my first unit in the Marines.
- You have my condolences.

07:27.797 --> 07:30.095
- You're being serious?
- Yeah.

07:30.266 --> 07:32.234
He's from Jersey.

07:32.401 --> 07:35.996
He's married, his wife's named Susan.
He plays baseball.

07:36.205 --> 07:39.072
He lives in Edison.
I've been to his house.

07:40.309 --> 07:41.776
Bullet in the head or no...

07:41.944 --> 07:45.004
...leaving a guy stuck in the wall
wasn't the most professional.

07:45.314 --> 07:48.283
- I thought it was a nice touch.
- You can joke all you want.

07:48.451 --> 07:50.009
Yeah, thanks.

07:50.219 --> 07:51.345
We had another grid.

07:51.521 --> 07:53.682
- We should've tried to get him.
- How we doing?

07:53.856 --> 07:57.587
Crappy. Self-sealing bolts. Magnetic
tumbler, some old-school chromo-alloy.

07:57.760 --> 07:59.751
- Someone didn't want this open.
- How long?

07:59.929 --> 08:02.193
Couple hours. Maybe three.

08:02.365 --> 08:03.832
We have one more box to go.

08:04.000 --> 08:06.992
If you're bitching as your way
of saying you want out, then go.

08:07.170 --> 08:10.037
Otherwise inject yourself
and shut your mouth.

08:27.790 --> 08:31.157
Mr. Kohl, please come in.

08:34.330 --> 08:35.854
This is amazing.

08:36.032 --> 08:39.159
The scale of this hardware store
is unprecedented.

08:39.335 --> 08:42.964
It's completely precedented.
There are stores like this everywhere.

08:43.139 --> 08:47.803
- All around the world, in every city.
- If anyone knows that, it's you.

08:47.977 --> 08:50.309
All right,
what's that supposed to mean?

08:50.479 --> 08:52.470
- My last phrase?
- Yes, your last phrase.

08:52.648 --> 08:55.242
"If anybody knows that, it's you."
What is that?

08:55.418 --> 08:58.012
I was implying
that you've traveled extensively.

08:58.187 --> 09:01.384
You were implying that I haven't stayed
still in the last 15 years.

09:01.557 --> 09:05.015
You were implying, and you've been
implying with increasing frequency...

09:05.194 --> 09:08.095
...that you don't approve
of my admittedly nomadic existence.

09:08.297 --> 09:11.425
You're saying you're disappointed
I haven't made more out of life.

09:11.601 --> 09:15.799
- That's what you're implying.
- Yes, I suppose so.

09:18.708 --> 09:21.438
The reason this store
seems like such a miracle to you...

09:21.611 --> 09:24.910
...is because you've been
in a mental institution for two decades...

09:25.081 --> 09:27.174
...which effectively does two things:
One...

09:27.350 --> 09:29.750
...it precludes you from knowing
much about me.

09:29.919 --> 09:33.411
About who I am, who I've been,
what I know, and what I've done.

09:33.589 --> 09:38.617
And two, it renders any fatherly
judgments you may have of me moot.

09:39.729 --> 09:41.424
Are we clear?

09:43.332 --> 09:45.061
Can I help you guys find something?

09:45.234 --> 09:48.931
Yes. We're looking for an electric saw.

09:49.105 --> 09:52.768
Preferably, variable speed
with an easily replaceable blade system.

09:52.942 --> 09:55.877
- What are you cutting, wood?
- Human tissue. Flesh and bone.

09:56.045 --> 09:58.240
It's more sinuous
than you may expect.

09:58.414 --> 10:00.541
It's really not that dire.

10:00.716 --> 10:03.617
Actually, potentially, it's far worse.

10:03.786 --> 10:07.722
I think that the saw you're looking for
is around the corner next to the routers.

10:07.890 --> 10:09.380
Thank you.

10:10.226 --> 10:12.456
No need to call the police.

10:15.765 --> 10:18.996
Mr. Jones, as you know,
we only have so much time so...

10:22.138 --> 10:24.265
The sentencing is scheduled
for next week.

10:24.440 --> 10:29.241
As I told you before,
I think the best we can hope for is life.

10:29.679 --> 10:33.115
- However, I will be filing an appeal.
- You spoke to my people?

10:33.816 --> 10:36.080
Do they have any news for me?

10:37.520 --> 10:42.924
Yes, they said that the job
in Philadelphia was successful.

10:43.092 --> 10:45.993
Good. Please, tell them
the following:

10:46.629 --> 10:51.032
They are to wire Mr. Loeb
another $100,000...

10:51.200 --> 10:55.330
...and to inform him of the location
of the next item.

10:58.474 --> 11:01.102
- I'll pass that along.
- Thank you.

11:01.277 --> 11:05.543
Here is the document.
If you could just take a quick look at it.

11:05.715 --> 11:09.515
This is a standard document for appeal.
If you'll just sign on the...

11:10.453 --> 11:11.477
What are you doing?

11:12.021 --> 11:15.548
Items that I will need
upon your next visit.

11:15.725 --> 11:17.625
My people will provide them for you.

11:17.793 --> 11:22.127
"Dramamine. Suntan lotion."
What are these for?

11:22.298 --> 11:28.294
As my employee, it really is
none of your concern, now, is it?

11:35.044 --> 11:38.639
What size are you? Suit size?

11:39.215 --> 11:40.842
Forty long. Why?

11:41.016 --> 11:43.507
The address of my personal tailor.

11:43.986 --> 11:46.546
He'll fix up something nice for you.

11:46.956 --> 11:50.824
My way of saying thank you
for all you've done for me.

12:03.672 --> 12:05.833
- Yes?
- Susan.

12:06.008 --> 12:07.373
Yeah.

12:07.543 --> 12:10.171
Olivia. Olivia Dunham.

12:11.080 --> 12:12.377
Hello.

12:12.882 --> 12:15.544
I'm afraid I have some bad news.

12:16.485 --> 12:20.251
I just can't believe it.
I just can't believe he's dead.

12:24.059 --> 12:26.926
Raul moved out about two years ago.

12:27.096 --> 12:28.893
We hadn't spoken in months.

12:29.532 --> 12:32.126
You know, I am so sorry.

12:32.301 --> 12:35.600
And please forgive me,
but did he mention these robberies?

12:35.771 --> 12:39.298
No. Can't say I'm surprised, though.

12:39.508 --> 12:41.100
What do you mean?

12:42.111 --> 12:45.979
Ever since he came back from the war,
he was just dark.

12:46.148 --> 12:50.608
Depression, drinking.
And I tried to help the best way I could.

12:50.786 --> 12:53.220
- I swear to God, but...
- I'm sure you did.

12:54.890 --> 12:57.120
And do you know anyone
he was hanging out with?

12:57.293 --> 13:00.421
Any of his recent friends?
Because I hadn't seen Raul in years.

13:00.596 --> 13:03.463
- You knew Raul?
- Yes, of course.

13:03.632 --> 13:05.395
We served together in the Marines.

13:06.469 --> 13:07.493
Oh.

13:07.903 --> 13:10.838
- I didn't know. I...
- We have met before.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.167
- Who? You and I?
- Yes.

13:13.342 --> 13:14.673
We had dinner here.

13:15.811 --> 13:17.335
You were in my house?

13:17.546 --> 13:21.482
Now, it took a little while to remember
because it was so long ago...

13:21.650 --> 13:24.278
...but Raul and I met
at Camp Pendleton.

13:24.587 --> 13:27.954
And we had dinner here,
the night that he became first lieutenant.

13:28.457 --> 13:31.017
No. You weren't here.

13:31.193 --> 13:33.787
Susan, I'm sorry, but I was.

13:33.963 --> 13:36.761
And you were a wonderful host.
You made pot roast...

13:36.932 --> 13:39.526
And it burned. Yes.
And we had to order in.

13:39.702 --> 13:42.671
Yeah, and the delivery guy
dropped the bag right here.

13:42.838 --> 13:46.501
And that piano
was actually in front of the window...

13:46.675 --> 13:48.700
...and the sofa was here by the fire.

13:48.878 --> 13:51.472
Yes, I remember.
But you were not here.

13:51.981 --> 13:56.577
The day Raul made first lieutenant,
it was just me, Raul, and John.

13:56.952 --> 13:58.010
Who?

13:58.454 --> 14:00.445
Raul's friend from Pendleton, John.

14:01.824 --> 14:04.588
- John who?
- John Scott.

14:10.666 --> 14:11.997
Are you okay?

14:24.547 --> 14:27.243
Almost there, son.

14:27.449 --> 14:30.885
Get ready. You can do it.

14:34.690 --> 14:36.180
Nice catch. Well done.

14:36.358 --> 14:39.691
I'm carrying a tray, Walter.
It's not exactly rocket science.

14:39.862 --> 14:42.729
What I said before
didn't come out as I intended.

14:42.898 --> 14:48.598
- What? The crack about the breasts?
- No, about my disappointment in you.

14:48.771 --> 14:51.706
It's more to do with your potential
than anything else.

14:51.874 --> 14:54.104
You have no idea
what you're capable of, Peter.

14:54.276 --> 14:58.110
That's sweet, Walter, but ultimately
unfair, especially coming from you.

14:59.281 --> 15:02.341
- So, what have we got here so far?
- Nothing yet.

15:02.518 --> 15:04.918
If we examine this flesh
at the cellular level...

15:05.087 --> 15:07.578
...we figure out how
they pass through solid matter.

15:07.756 --> 15:11.624
What we perceive as solid matter
is mostly empty space.

15:11.794 --> 15:14.695
Just as we may perceive
that a life is full...

15:14.863 --> 15:17.730
...that is actually a series
of empty encounters.

15:17.900 --> 15:20.425
He's been like that all day.
It's been awesome.

15:20.603 --> 15:23.902
To accomplish this,
your bank robbers would need...

15:24.073 --> 15:26.564
...cutting-edge knowledge
of quantum physics...

15:26.742 --> 15:28.232
...not to mention technology...

15:28.410 --> 15:31.038
...that would cost more
than a dozen banks could hold.

15:31.947 --> 15:34.643
How'd it go with Raul Lugo's wife?

15:34.817 --> 15:38.378
They were separated, so she hadn't
had much contact with him for months.

15:38.554 --> 15:41.751
But she said he'd suffered
from depression.

15:43.125 --> 15:44.888
Are you okay?

15:45.761 --> 15:47.820
Yeah. I'm good.

15:48.030 --> 15:52.160
No, Peter's right.
Your pupils are dilated.

15:52.668 --> 15:56.604
It's a symptom of high stress,
unless you're using hallucinogens.

15:56.772 --> 15:59.297
- Are you tripping, Agent Dunham?
- Walter.

16:03.312 --> 16:06.110
I didn't recognize Raul Lugo.

16:06.281 --> 16:07.612
John Scott did.

16:08.784 --> 16:10.945
You're confusing
John Scott's memories...

16:11.120 --> 16:12.678
With my own.

16:13.422 --> 16:15.822
- So you never met this guy.
- No.

16:15.991 --> 16:18.016
But I could've sworn I did.

16:18.193 --> 16:20.161
That...

16:20.329 --> 16:23.856
I don't understand that.
I need to look into that.

16:24.066 --> 16:26.591
Okay, first we need to figure out
what happened here.

16:26.769 --> 16:30.205
Who did this, what they want,
and what they're gonna do next.

16:45.988 --> 16:48.388
- Success.
- Nice job.

16:48.590 --> 16:51.525
- You gonna let us see what's in these?
- I don't think so.

16:51.694 --> 16:54.822
And even if I did,
you wouldn't understand.

17:13.682 --> 17:16.048
- I thought we were making progress.
- We were.

17:16.218 --> 17:19.654
But we've hit a dead end trying
to reconstruct John Scott's memories.

17:19.821 --> 17:23.883
If we push further, we risk destroying
the fragments we're trying to retrieve.

17:24.059 --> 17:26.892
Not to place any undue pressure
on you and your team...

17:27.061 --> 17:29.553
...but we're in a race against
motivated individuals.

17:29.732 --> 17:34.032
Right now,
John Scott is our only advantage.

17:34.269 --> 17:35.998
Understood.

17:49.551 --> 17:52.349
So why did you need me
to go get all that rice?

17:52.521 --> 17:53.852
No talking.

17:54.022 --> 17:56.684
Walter, what's the rice for?
What's with all the toys?

17:56.859 --> 18:00.795
These were in my storage. They're your
toys from when you were a little boy.

18:00.963 --> 18:04.296
- Those aren't mine.
- I suppose they must be mine.

18:04.466 --> 18:05.899
It's the netting, Peter.

18:06.068 --> 18:08.935
I believe the swatch left behind
was from a larger piece...

18:09.104 --> 18:12.437
...that was draped over the vault wall.
That somehow is the key.

18:12.608 --> 18:16.772
Although, I'm not sure yet exactly how
they would... Aha! Ha, ha, ha.

18:17.446 --> 18:21.644
Now, what do you see here?

18:21.817 --> 18:24.081
So far, some rice and a bunch of toys.

18:24.253 --> 18:27.882
This gentleman is standing on
what appears to be solid. Hm?

18:28.991 --> 18:32.483
However, add vibration.

18:39.768 --> 18:41.998
- I'm quite envious of this.
- Of what?

18:42.204 --> 18:45.640
Well, somehow the robbers
were able to weaken the vault wall.

18:45.808 --> 18:49.300
High-frequency vibrations
disrupting its atomic structure...

18:49.478 --> 18:52.572
...allowing another piece
of solid matter through it.

18:52.981 --> 18:55.575
Well, obviously
what I'm showing you here...

18:55.751 --> 18:57.082
...is a theoretical example.

18:57.252 --> 18:59.948
In actuality, this feat would
be immensely complicated...

19:00.122 --> 19:02.852
...and, apparently,
not without consequences.

19:03.025 --> 19:09.487
It seems that use of this technology
can render one slightly radioactive.

19:09.832 --> 19:12.266
- How slightly?
- Well...

19:12.434 --> 19:14.129
...not as slightly as I thought.

19:15.938 --> 19:18.805
Miss, uh, would you mind
putting the hand on ice?

19:18.974 --> 19:20.601
It will help preserve the tissue.

19:20.776 --> 19:22.141
Just so I'm clear, Walter...

19:22.311 --> 19:25.474
...the robbers have managed
to violate the laws of the universe...

19:25.647 --> 19:27.808
...and they're also radioactive?
- Who?

19:27.983 --> 19:30.315
Our robbers, apparently.
Where you been?

19:30.485 --> 19:32.180
Been working. Where have you been?

19:32.354 --> 19:34.822
I've been buying rice for Walter's toys.

19:34.990 --> 19:37.458
Did you get any leads
on the safety-deposit boxes?

19:37.626 --> 19:41.562
Yeah, they were all purchased
23 years ago, all paid for in cash.

19:41.763 --> 19:43.560
Bogus names on each account.

19:43.765 --> 19:46.131
- How radioactive?
- Slightly.

19:46.301 --> 19:48.360
Though not as slight
as Walter would like.

19:48.537 --> 19:51.233
We have no idea who those
safety-deposit boxes belong to.

19:51.406 --> 19:53.306
No. And it's untraceable.

19:53.475 --> 19:56.308
Can you call hospitals
in and around the Philadelphia area?

19:56.478 --> 20:00.141
Get them to call us if anyone comes in
showing signs of radiation poisoning.

20:00.315 --> 20:01.407
- Yeah, I'm on it.
- Okay.

20:02.217 --> 20:04.845
Okay. So, what's our next move?

20:05.020 --> 20:07.318
Raul Lugo was a good kid
before the military.

20:07.489 --> 20:10.322
Had a clean record,
responsible employee.

20:10.492 --> 20:12.824
I wanna know
how he became a criminal...

20:12.995 --> 20:15.657
...why they recruited him
and what they promised him.

20:15.831 --> 20:18.823
- So how are we gonna do that?
- Lugo's wife gave me some names.

20:19.001 --> 20:24.098
It just so happens his best friend from
high school works at a bar in Cambridge.

20:26.508 --> 20:28.499
Did I just hear "bar" and "Cambridge"?

20:29.811 --> 20:33.577
- Hey, Astrid, would you mind, uh...?
- Watching Walter? I'm on that too.

20:33.749 --> 20:38.186
Now, miss, I'm going to repeat
the demonstration with the rice.

20:38.353 --> 20:39.843
- Would you care to watch?
- Nope.

20:40.022 --> 20:41.751
Okay.

20:44.593 --> 20:48.256
- Just go along with this, okay?
- Sure thing, boss.

20:48.430 --> 20:49.624
- Hi.
- Hey.

20:49.831 --> 20:51.958
- How's your night?
- Had worse. What can I get?

20:52.134 --> 20:54.602
- Double shot of whiskey.
- What's your preference?

20:54.770 --> 20:56.203
- Your call.
- You?

20:56.738 --> 20:58.035
Same as the lady.

20:58.206 --> 21:00.140
I'm Stephanie.
This is my brother, Rick.

21:00.342 --> 21:02.242
- Hey, Brother Rick.
- Hi.

21:02.411 --> 21:06.040
- You know, you look familiar.
- Who, me?

21:10.385 --> 21:12.148
Cheers.

21:13.121 --> 21:14.213
Um...

21:15.223 --> 21:16.713
I'll take another.

21:18.727 --> 21:21.628
- Are you sure we haven't met before?
- I don't think so.

21:21.797 --> 21:23.128
- What's your name?
- Drew.

21:23.298 --> 21:25.789
Drew, I gotta tell you,
I never forget a face.

21:25.968 --> 21:29.131
It's true, she doesn't.
It's kind of creepy, actually.

21:29.304 --> 21:32.603
- I got it. Raul and Susan's wedding.
- No way. You were there?

21:32.774 --> 21:34.469
- You were the best man.
- Yeah.

21:34.643 --> 21:38.409
It's incredible. She's been able to do that
since we were kids. Remember that?

21:38.580 --> 21:39.911
- I do.
- Yeah.

21:40.082 --> 21:42.607
- So do you still see them?
- No, it's been years.

21:42.784 --> 21:45.753
I was friends with Susan in college,
but we lost contact too.

21:45.921 --> 21:47.855
It's horrible.
Where are they living now?

21:48.023 --> 21:50.457
- I don't know. I heard they split.
- Oh, no.

21:50.625 --> 21:52.593
- Yeah, well, I'm not surprised.
- Why not?

21:52.761 --> 21:54.695
I don't know. Raul got weird.

21:55.263 --> 21:57.595
- Weird how?
- You know, he was in the Gulf War...

21:57.766 --> 22:01.497
...and he sort of, I don't know, has
post-traumatic stress or something.

22:01.670 --> 22:05.663
I feel bad. I'm sure I would've lost my
mind if I'd gone to the Gulf War as well.

22:05.841 --> 22:08.639
Anyway, when he got back,
he didn't come around much.

22:08.810 --> 22:10.835
- He started hanging at the V.A.
- Which one?

22:11.013 --> 22:12.173
- Don't know.
- Bartender.

22:12.347 --> 22:14.212
A shame. He was a good guy.
Excuse me.

22:14.416 --> 22:15.974
Sure.

22:19.855 --> 22:21.948
- Brother?
- Uh-huh.

22:22.124 --> 22:25.218
Yeah. It, uh... It kind of works
better that way.

22:25.427 --> 22:26.917
Does it, now?

22:28.997 --> 22:30.328
- Broyles.
- It's Dunham.

22:30.499 --> 22:33.366
I was wondering if you could
find out what V.A. hospital...

22:33.535 --> 22:35.400
...Raul Lugo might've gone to.

22:35.570 --> 22:38.869
- There was nothing in his records.
- I know. That's why I'm calling.

22:39.041 --> 22:41.168
Can you help me?

22:41.343 --> 22:44.335
I'll do what I can.
I'll have an answer for you in an hour.

22:44.513 --> 22:46.037
Thanks.

22:47.049 --> 22:48.778
Let's go. He'll want us back
in an hour.

22:48.950 --> 22:50.474
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's the rush?

22:50.652 --> 22:52.517
Two's your limit?

22:54.056 --> 22:56.320
Is that a dare?

22:56.491 --> 22:57.515
Rook, to E-seven.

22:57.692 --> 22:59.023
Check.

22:59.194 --> 23:02.721
So I took a look at his papers
while he was checking in that box.

23:02.898 --> 23:04.729
- So?
- It's a map of Germany.

23:04.900 --> 23:07.095
- Germany?
- Yeah, Frankfurt. Lines all over it.

23:07.269 --> 23:11.000
Latitude and longitude. It looked
like he's planning a damn invasion.

23:11.173 --> 23:13.038
I got next.

23:13.208 --> 23:15.676
All right, listen up. We're headed out.

23:15.844 --> 23:17.368
- Let's go.
- Where to?

23:17.546 --> 23:19.275
Providence.

23:26.555 --> 23:27.988
Pick a card.

23:29.691 --> 23:30.988
All right.

23:31.860 --> 23:36.456
Now, I need you
to memorize that card.

23:36.631 --> 23:37.893
- Okay.
- You got it?

23:38.066 --> 23:39.090
- I got it.
- You sure?

23:39.267 --> 23:41.394
- Absolutely positive.
- Absolutely positive.

23:41.570 --> 23:43.629
- If you don't, it doesn't work.
- I remember.

23:43.805 --> 23:45.363
Good.

23:45.540 --> 23:49.408
And just like everything else we do
around here, it's about to get weirder.

23:52.614 --> 23:54.411
- It's good, right?
- That was great.

23:54.583 --> 23:56.107
- So top that.
- Okay.

23:56.284 --> 23:59.378
Seriously. That's fantastic.
Women never have card tricks.

23:59.554 --> 24:03.718
Tell me when to stop.
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven...

24:03.892 --> 24:06.019
- Stop.
- Which one?

24:07.095 --> 24:08.722
Four of clubs.

24:12.267 --> 24:16.033
- Eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve...
- Stop.

24:20.542 --> 24:22.305
Queen of diamonds.

24:23.812 --> 24:26.679
- You can count cards.
- That's all I would do when I was a kid.

24:26.848 --> 24:30.113
If I was a child today,
I would be diagnosed with something.

24:30.285 --> 24:33.652
I have this thing for numbers.
I see them once and remember them.

24:33.822 --> 24:34.846
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

24:35.056 --> 24:40.153
7240168.

24:40.328 --> 24:44.788
36, 21, 7.

24:44.966 --> 24:49.062
233, 377 and 610.

24:50.839 --> 24:52.329
- What?
- I can do more.

24:52.507 --> 24:55.305
Say that again, the numbers
on the safety-deposit boxes.

24:55.477 --> 24:59.777
- 233, 377 and 610. Why?
- I know those numbers.

25:03.218 --> 25:06.676
Walter. Hey, Walter. Wake up.

25:06.855 --> 25:08.584
Walter, Walter, wake up.
This is important.

25:08.757 --> 25:10.247
Oh.

25:10.792 --> 25:13.818
Oh, oh. Do you two want
to use the room?

25:13.995 --> 25:16.054
The numbers that you recite.
What are they?

25:16.231 --> 25:18.722
- Numbers?
- Every night, you recite a sequence...

25:18.900 --> 25:22.301
...to help you fall asleep:
233, 377, 610.

25:22.470 --> 25:25.906
- 987, 1597.
- Precisely those. What is that pattern?

25:26.107 --> 25:28.371
It's the Fibonacci sequence.

25:28.543 --> 25:31.376
You should know that, Peter.
If you had stayed at college...

25:31.546 --> 25:34.310
Walter, not everybody knows
the Fibonacci sequence.

25:34.482 --> 25:37.349
Sure they do. It's a wildly famous
mathematical sequence.

25:37.519 --> 25:41.421
Each number in the sequence
is the sum of the two preceding it.

25:41.623 --> 25:44.353
Including 233, 377 and 610...

25:44.526 --> 25:47.654
...which happen to be the numbers
of the boxes that were stolen.

25:47.829 --> 25:50.093
It's fascinating...

25:50.265 --> 25:55.259
...but it's a coincidence.
It can't possibly be significant.

25:58.707 --> 26:00.231
Unless...

26:01.443 --> 26:02.705
Oh, my God.

26:03.545 --> 26:05.172
What?

26:07.215 --> 26:10.446
The safety-deposit boxes are mine.

26:18.793 --> 26:22.593
Cleveland, Baltimore, Philadelphia.
Cleveland, Baltimore, Philadelphia.

26:22.764 --> 26:24.823
Walter, are there any other
deposit boxes...

26:25.000 --> 26:27.264
...that haven't been broken into yet?

26:27.435 --> 26:28.663
I don't know.

26:28.837 --> 26:30.998
I don't know where
because I can't remember...

26:31.172 --> 26:34.437
...why I put things into the boxes.
- So let me get this straight.

26:34.609 --> 26:36.600
You can remember traveling
23 years ago...

26:36.778 --> 26:39.042
...renting deposit boxes
under assumed names...

26:39.247 --> 26:41.772
...but you can't remember why?

26:43.051 --> 26:46.487
The why is of secondary importance
to what.

26:46.655 --> 26:49.123
What was I protecting?

26:50.025 --> 26:52.892
Whatever it was,
I didn't use my usual hiding places...

26:53.061 --> 26:56.462
...so I suspect it was something
of profound significance.

26:56.631 --> 26:59.361
Well, excellent. That clears it right up.

27:00.201 --> 27:03.659
I was under a great deal of stress
at the time.

27:06.041 --> 27:08.339
It was before the accident in the lab.

27:08.510 --> 27:12.412
Before that poor lab assistant
lost her life.

27:14.149 --> 27:18.483
I was distrustful of everybody.

27:18.653 --> 27:20.018
William Bell, your mother.

27:20.689 --> 27:24.648
I was convinced I was being followed.
Someone was watching my every move.

27:24.826 --> 27:26.487
Which medication is that, Walter?

27:29.564 --> 27:31.429
Supplements.

27:31.666 --> 27:33.861
Walter, did you tell anybody else?

27:38.540 --> 27:40.030
I told you I was paranoid.

27:40.208 --> 27:42.039
Okay, get dressed. We're going out.

27:43.912 --> 27:46.403
- Breakfast?
- According to your travel records...

27:46.581 --> 27:50.176
...in 1985, you gave a lecture
at Syracuse University.

27:50.352 --> 27:54.083
Now, these photos are of banks
in the Syracuse area.

27:54.255 --> 27:57.190
Does any of this
trigger anything in your mind?

27:57.359 --> 27:59.919
Yes, but not about banks.

28:00.095 --> 28:02.791
Think back 20 years.

28:02.964 --> 28:06.730
Imagine yourself then
imagining yourself now...

28:06.901 --> 28:09.199
...twenty years into the future.

28:09.838 --> 28:13.604
In your wildest imagination,
could you ever think you'd be here?

28:17.545 --> 28:20.207
- Is he stoned?
- Just show him the other batch...

28:20.382 --> 28:25.285
...and be patient with him.
His mind works in a different way.

28:27.856 --> 28:29.414
Agent Dunham.

28:31.459 --> 28:32.790
What's up?

28:32.961 --> 28:36.556
After he split up with his wife,
Raul Lugo moved to D.C..

28:36.731 --> 28:40.428
He was an inpatient at the V.A. there
from last May to mid-October.

28:40.602 --> 28:42.934
- No visitors.
- Not according to the records.

28:43.104 --> 28:44.435
Don't know what that does...

28:44.606 --> 28:48.736
...to your theory he was recruited there.
- Unless it was by another patient.

28:49.811 --> 28:50.835
You have something?

28:51.012 --> 28:53.003
Something remarkable, actually.

28:53.181 --> 28:55.411
We tried to access
Agent Scott's hippocampus.

28:55.583 --> 28:57.915
His brain-wave echo
suddenly became erratic.

28:58.086 --> 29:00.020
Inconsistent in ways
we've never seen.

29:00.188 --> 29:02.088
The cause of the inconsistency?

29:02.257 --> 29:05.522
We managed to resolve the last image
in Agent Scott's optic nerve...

29:05.693 --> 29:06.751
...before he died.

29:06.928 --> 29:10.386
This image is linked to a second set
of brain-wave echoes:

29:13.101 --> 29:14.125
Agent Dunham's.

29:14.302 --> 29:17.294
They must have somehow
shared consciousness.

29:17.472 --> 29:21.465
If that's the case, it would suggest
that some of John Scott's memories...

29:21.643 --> 29:26.512
...perhaps the very ones we need...
- Are in Agent Dunham's mind.

29:34.989 --> 29:39.153
Hi. Uh, Agent Dunham with DHS.
I'm looking for Dr. Bruce Miller.

29:41.463 --> 29:42.953
Thank you.

29:43.731 --> 29:46.165
Excuse me, Dr. Miller?

29:46.334 --> 29:49.826
- Agent Olivia Dunham. I'm with DHS.
- What can I do for you, Agent Dunham?

29:50.004 --> 29:53.132
I wanted to talk to you
about a patient of yours, Raul Lugo.

29:53.308 --> 29:55.503
Marine, Force Recon, history of PTSD.

29:55.677 --> 29:58.475
I'm sure you know
I can't violate patient confidentiality.

29:58.646 --> 30:00.341
Raul Lugo is dead, Dr. Miller...

30:00.515 --> 30:03.643
...so his right to confidentiality
no longer applies.

30:03.818 --> 30:06.082
I'm investigating his death...

30:06.254 --> 30:10.156
...and I need to know about his friends,
people that he got close to...

30:10.325 --> 30:13.488
If you're referring to patients,
those records are also protected.

30:13.661 --> 30:15.891
If they're involved in criminal activity...

30:16.064 --> 30:18.328
...it would be your duty
to release them to me.

30:18.500 --> 30:21.492
- What crimes?
- I'm sorry. I'm not authorized to tell you.

30:21.669 --> 30:24.035
Suffice to say, the criminals
I'm investigating...

30:24.205 --> 30:26.196
...are all highly trained, well-skilled...

30:26.374 --> 30:29.434
Agent Dunham, I have two dozen
patients to see before I go home.

30:29.611 --> 30:32.603
I'm not about to violate
my ethical duty based on your say-so.

30:32.780 --> 30:35.943
If you'd like to come back
with a subpoena, I'd be glad to help.

30:36.117 --> 30:39.177
But until then,
you'll have to excuse me.

30:46.094 --> 30:48.119
He liked to play chess.

30:48.696 --> 30:49.720
Raul.

30:49.898 --> 30:52.594
He, uh, used to play chess all day long.

30:52.767 --> 30:55.395
- With anyone in particular?
- There were four of them.

30:55.570 --> 30:58.437
- The chess club.
- And you remember their names?

30:58.606 --> 30:59.732
Get a pencil.

31:12.420 --> 31:13.819
Let's go.

31:14.022 --> 31:15.489
Let's go, let's move, let's go.

31:15.657 --> 31:17.989
Door. Let's move.

31:18.159 --> 31:20.491
Robert Norton, captain,
United States Air Force.

31:20.662 --> 31:22.459
Honorably discharged April of '04.

31:22.630 --> 31:24.598
Pull up his phone records
and financials.

31:24.766 --> 31:28.463
- See if anything else ties him to Lugo.
- I'm on it.

31:28.636 --> 31:31.628
These are the V.A. visitor logs.
These men were recruited.

31:31.806 --> 31:34.172
Comb the logs
and follow up on every entry.

31:34.342 --> 31:37.334
I talked to McNeil's wife.
Says her husband's away on business.

31:37.545 --> 31:40.810
- She hasn't heard from him in two days.
- Call his work.

31:40.982 --> 31:44.110
We got something. One of
our vets bought three one-way tickets...

31:44.285 --> 31:46.150
...to T.F. Green Airport in Providence.

31:46.321 --> 31:48.949
- When do they land?
- Forty-seven minutes ago.

31:53.428 --> 31:54.452
Hey, what's up?

31:54.629 --> 31:56.597
We think the next bank is in Providence.

31:56.764 --> 31:58.823
Can you see if it jogs Walter's memory?

31:59.000 --> 31:59.989
Yeah, sure.

32:00.168 --> 32:02.329
Downstrokes only.
Brush with the grain.

32:02.503 --> 32:05.836
Hey, Walter, are any of those banks
you rented boxes in in Providence?

32:06.007 --> 32:09.602
Providence? I don't believe so, no.

32:09.777 --> 32:12.371
I'm sorry, Peter.
I have tried everything to remember.

32:12.947 --> 32:17.577
I understand how important it is,
and I'm quite disappointed with myself.

32:18.820 --> 32:20.515
Hold on a sec.

32:22.657 --> 32:25.683
When she's finished chewing her cud,
brush her teeth.

32:25.860 --> 32:30.058
I am not brushing a cow's teeth, Walter.
You know I have real work to do, right?

32:30.231 --> 32:33.894
If you were gonna rent a deposit box
in Providence, what bank would you use?

32:34.102 --> 32:37.503
In Providence? That would have to be
the Fairmont Savings Bank.

32:37.672 --> 32:42.302
It's the only one with safe-deposit boxes
big enough for my purposes.

32:44.112 --> 32:45.704
Oh, well done, son.

32:47.649 --> 32:50.345
The Fairmont Savings Bank,
off Westminster Street.

32:50.518 --> 32:53.817
- You're sure?
- Oh, yeah. I'm sure.

32:53.988 --> 32:56.081
Agent. Sam Martin, Providence SAC.

32:56.257 --> 32:58.418
Francis and Dunham.
So, what's our status?

32:58.626 --> 33:00.491
All surrounding streets
are locked down.

33:00.662 --> 33:03.995
Per your request, my men are checking
all shared walls and alleyways.

33:04.165 --> 33:06.030
This is Mr. Grimes.
He manages the bank.

33:06.200 --> 33:09.328
I don't understand. We've had no alarms
or signs of forced entry.

33:09.504 --> 33:12.996
- This crew doesn't work like that.
- We have cameras, motion detectors...

33:13.174 --> 33:16.405
...sensors that detect fractional
variances in ambient temperature.

33:16.577 --> 33:18.602
They might be
disabling that wirelessly...

33:18.780 --> 33:22.113
...shooting you a feedback loop
of old data while they stop and shop.

33:22.283 --> 33:24.251
Oh, my God.

33:24.952 --> 33:28.615
Nine-eight-seven. It's the next
number in the Fibonacci sequence.

33:28.790 --> 33:30.781
These four walls are internal
to the bank.

33:30.958 --> 33:34.359
I don't care how they got in here,
they're still in my perimeter.

33:34.529 --> 33:36.190
This layout's not easy.

33:36.364 --> 33:38.730
Even if they did get through
one of these walls...

33:38.900 --> 33:41.368
...they've got multiple other walls
on every side.

33:41.536 --> 33:44.130
They wouldn't have time
to breach them all.

33:44.305 --> 33:46.899
What's underneath?
A basement or access tunnels?

33:47.075 --> 33:48.702
No, this is the basement.

33:48.876 --> 33:51.811
There's 2 feet of solid steel
and then the foundation.

33:51.979 --> 33:55.312
Gas main, sewer, electric.

33:55.483 --> 33:57.610
- Sewer.
- Providence P.D...

33:57.785 --> 34:01.482
...I need the closest sewer-line exit
to Fairmont Savings Bank.

34:03.424 --> 34:05.119
Let's go.

34:08.496 --> 34:11.397
- FBI, freeze!
- Go, go, go!

34:11.966 --> 34:13.956
Come on, come on.

34:20.108 --> 34:22.474
Come on, man.
Come on, you can do it. Come on.

34:22.643 --> 34:24.804
Reach out. You got it.
You got it.

34:24.978 --> 34:27.208
They're right there.
They're on your back.

34:27.415 --> 34:28.473
Let's go.

34:32.453 --> 34:36.081
This is Francis, ID number 31556.

34:36.257 --> 34:40.853
I need a BOLO on a black cargo van
heading south on Westminster...

34:41.027 --> 34:44.020
...license-plate number 10562-Sierra.

34:44.232 --> 34:47.531
I also need EMS. Suspect down.

34:56.710 --> 34:58.269
- Damn it!
- Shut up.

34:58.446 --> 35:01.142
Scrub down and take your shots.
I want this box open now.

35:01.315 --> 35:03.476
Not until you show me
what this is all about.

35:20.902 --> 35:23.268
One guy dead,
another put away for that? A camera?

35:23.437 --> 35:24.563
What the hell is it?

35:24.739 --> 35:29.506
Word of advice: Don't pry into things
you couldn't possibly understand.

35:33.614 --> 35:35.309
We're on.

35:35.483 --> 35:37.246
He's coming tonight.

35:37.952 --> 35:38.976
Perfect.

35:40.755 --> 35:42.620
Very good.

35:51.432 --> 35:55.266
I see you didn't take me up
on my offer to go see my tailor.

35:55.436 --> 35:58.633
No, I like this suit.
It's always been lucky for me.

35:58.806 --> 36:01.001
Well, I can appreciate that.

36:03.978 --> 36:05.343
Thank you, Mr. Kohl.

36:05.947 --> 36:09.178
Come back in the morning
with the paperwork for my appeal.

36:09.350 --> 36:14.117
Six-thirty sharp.
I'll be happy to sign it then.

36:14.288 --> 36:18.054
Oh, and wear one of your lucky suits.

36:19.026 --> 36:21.790
- Will there be anything else?
- As a matter of fact, yes.

36:21.963 --> 36:26.696
I'll need my people
to procure one last item.

36:26.868 --> 36:28.495
And what would that be?

36:28.669 --> 36:35.404
Not a what, Mr. Kohl.
In this case, a whom.

36:55.029 --> 36:56.929
Target in sight.

37:00.101 --> 37:02.228
We have your service record,
Mr. Eastwick.

37:02.403 --> 37:05.930
Your 10-40s.
We know everything about you...

37:06.107 --> 37:09.235
...except what it was
that you wanted so badly...

37:09.410 --> 37:11.435
...you'd walk through a solid wall.

37:11.612 --> 37:15.173
Ryan Shawn Eastwick, staff sergeant,
First Special Forces Group...

37:15.349 --> 37:20.082
...Third Battalion, 29-869-617.

37:20.254 --> 37:22.848
You're not a POW, Eastwick.
You're a criminal.

37:23.424 --> 37:25.392
Look at his hands.

37:25.593 --> 37:27.959
- They look jittery.
- She's wearing him down.

37:28.129 --> 37:30.893
No, I don't think so.
That looks physiological.

37:33.334 --> 37:36.462
Call her out, would you? I got an idea.

37:36.637 --> 37:39.128
I wasn't aware you had a background
in interrogation.

37:41.275 --> 37:45.644
I've been in rooms like that,
on both sides of the table.

37:45.846 --> 37:49.577
This'll either work, or it won't.
Either way, it's only two minutes.

37:49.750 --> 37:52.651
We have enough to put you down
for armed robbery times three.

37:52.853 --> 37:55.617
That's 20 years
in federal prison.

37:55.790 --> 37:58.953
Do you think the prisoners there will care
that you were a hero...

37:59.126 --> 38:00.889
...fighting for your country?

38:18.679 --> 38:22.376
You lose him, we lose time.
We lose everything.

38:28.756 --> 38:32.123
Look, you're a tough guy,
I'm a tough guy.

38:32.293 --> 38:34.818
I think we can dispense
with the formalities.

38:34.996 --> 38:37.362
I'm not gonna stick a thumb
in that shot-up leg...

38:37.531 --> 38:41.763
...because A, I think that's exactly
what you expect me to do, and B...

38:41.936 --> 38:44.166
...I don't think you'd crack anyway.

38:48.175 --> 38:50.803
Now, all I want from you...

38:52.546 --> 38:55.140
...is to show me your hands.

38:58.185 --> 38:59.948
Right.

39:00.121 --> 39:02.351
Let me see
if any of this rings a bell for you.

39:02.523 --> 39:06.391
You've been shaking uncontrollably.
You vomited twice in the last 10 hours.

39:06.560 --> 39:09.996
This morning, you found hair
on your pillow. It's starting to fall out.

39:10.164 --> 39:12.496
- What's wrong with me?
- Radiation poisoning.

39:13.434 --> 39:15.902
Right now,
you're in the walking-ghost phase. Enjoy.

39:16.070 --> 39:18.561
It's better
than the intestinal bleeding, delirium...

39:18.739 --> 39:21.333
...and coma phase
you're gonna hit in a couple days.

39:21.509 --> 39:23.841
You violated the laws of physics,
Mr. Eastwick...

39:24.011 --> 39:25.842
...and Mother Nature's a bitch.

39:30.384 --> 39:31.908
Are you a doctor?

39:32.086 --> 39:34.213
I need to know
what you were hired to steal.

39:34.388 --> 39:36.822
- He didn't tell us.
- Who's he? I need a name.

39:36.991 --> 39:39.983
He never told us his name. All right?

39:40.161 --> 39:43.892
We were freelance, hired out.
He equipped us, trained us.

39:44.865 --> 39:46.594
The others' names don't matter.

39:46.767 --> 39:49.759
- He's got everything he needs.
- Everything he needs to do what?

39:49.970 --> 39:52.768
Are you gonna help me or not?

39:54.875 --> 39:57.173
Actually, Ryan, no.

39:57.344 --> 40:00.905
I'm gonna go on the other side
of that glass and watch you bleed out...

40:01.082 --> 40:03.676
...unless you tell me
everything I need to know.

40:03.851 --> 40:06.217
I swear, I don't know what he's doing.

40:06.787 --> 40:09.688
Look, all I know is...
I overheard a phone conversation once.

40:09.857 --> 40:11.586
He's going to a field in Westford.

40:11.759 --> 40:13.886
- What field?
- I don't know!

40:14.061 --> 40:15.722
Look, you gotta help me, all right?

40:15.896 --> 40:18.524
I need some medicine, okay?
Some specialists.

40:19.366 --> 40:21.766
Please, you gotta help me.

40:21.936 --> 40:24.769
Hey! Hey!

40:27.741 --> 40:30.608
- There. Westford.
- That's 30 square miles.

40:30.778 --> 40:33.440
- How are we gonna find one field?
- Wait.

40:34.014 --> 40:35.413
What?

40:35.749 --> 40:39.048
I know where they're going.
There's an abandoned airstrip out there.

40:39.220 --> 40:41.211
It's called Little Hill Field.

40:41.388 --> 40:43.322
That's the code word...

40:43.524 --> 40:46.322
...Joseph Smith gave to Jones
in the case a few weeks ago.

40:46.527 --> 40:47.994
The guy from the German prison?

40:48.162 --> 40:51.962
It can't be a coincidence, Charlie.
It's in Westford, just off Route 3.

40:52.533 --> 40:54.558
You come in from the west.
I'll take south.

40:54.735 --> 40:56.566
All right. Listen up!

40:56.737 --> 41:00.173
I need every available unit
for field assist.

41:00.341 --> 41:02.275
Let's move, move, move!

41:08.349 --> 41:11.113
It's in here somewhere.

41:11.285 --> 41:13.651
What I hid in those banks.

41:13.821 --> 41:16.949
Must be. I kept very thorough records.

41:17.124 --> 41:20.582
Yeah. Unfortunately,
not very organized records.

41:26.834 --> 41:28.495
That's quite impressive.

41:28.669 --> 41:29.795
It's a nervous tic.

41:32.640 --> 41:34.267
Which hand?

41:37.044 --> 41:38.170
That's fantastic.

41:39.980 --> 41:41.038
Magic.

41:46.253 --> 41:47.686
What?

41:49.056 --> 41:51.115
You nearly died
when you were a boy.

41:52.326 --> 41:54.851
You started bruising,
then your kidneys failed.

41:55.029 --> 41:59.295
Doctors didn't know what it was.
The closest diagnosis was hepea.

41:59.466 --> 42:04.199
It's a rare form of bird flu
that hadn't been around for decades.

42:05.573 --> 42:09.202
Your mother was beside herself.

42:09.376 --> 42:12.777
She stopped eating,
she stopped sleeping...

42:13.514 --> 42:15.004
...and I was worse.

42:15.182 --> 42:18.811
After all, I was the scientist,
and here, my only son was dying...

42:18.986 --> 42:21.648
...and I couldn't do anything.
- I don't remember that.

42:21.822 --> 42:25.883
I became consumed with saving you,
conquering the disease.

42:26.060 --> 42:29.894
In my research, I discovered a doctor.

42:30.064 --> 42:33.591
Alfred Gross. Swiss. Brilliant physician.

42:33.801 --> 42:37.532
He was the only man that had ever
successfully cured a case of hepea.

42:37.705 --> 42:41.232
But there was a problem.
He had died in 1936...

42:41.408 --> 42:46.072
...and so I designed a device
intended to reach back into time...

42:46.247 --> 42:51.241
...to cross the time-space continuum
and retrieve Alfred Gross...

42:51.418 --> 42:55.821
...to bring him back with me
to fix you, my dying son.

42:56.924 --> 42:59.051
The device, Peter.

43:00.628 --> 43:03.563
I think that's what I hid
in those safe-deposit boxes.

43:03.731 --> 43:05.221
And it worked?

43:05.399 --> 43:08.334
You were able to go back to 1936
and get this guy?

43:09.336 --> 43:10.860
No.

43:11.038 --> 43:15.372
Before I could test it,
you started to recover.

43:15.542 --> 43:17.874
Doctors said it was a miracle.

43:18.612 --> 43:22.104
But the science behind it...
In theory, it would work.

43:22.283 --> 43:27.721
In theory,
it could retrieve anyone from anywhere.

43:37.731 --> 43:40.359
Continue north on Plain Avenue...

43:40.567 --> 43:42.865
...for 1.2 miles.

44:04.658 --> 44:06.353
- Dunham.
- It's Charlie.

44:06.527 --> 44:09.655
I'm headed east on Route 3,
about 2 miles out. What's your 20?

44:09.830 --> 44:12.594
I'm 10 minutes out,
coming in from the south on Plain.

44:20.307 --> 44:26.371
49.1.112295 degrees north.

44:26.547 --> 44:31.917
8.916092 degrees east.

44:33.520 --> 44:39.220
33.33 grad.
We're good to go.

44:42.563 --> 44:44.997
- What time do you have?
- Twelve-thirty.

44:51.171 --> 44:54.572
- Mr. Jones.
- Mr. Kohl.

44:55.376 --> 45:00.746
I have the appeal request
all prepared and ready to go.

45:02.449 --> 45:06.044
All I need is your signature.

45:06.587 --> 45:10.853
This is Bravo team, entering Westford,
pulling out onto Bridge Street.

45:36.617 --> 45:40.018
Charlie, a black SUV
just came out of nowhere.

45:56.203 --> 45:58.933
Where are you?
Give me your 20.

45:59.373 --> 46:00.431
Liv?

46:07.614 --> 46:09.104
Target captured.

48:08.168 --> 48:10.659
- Hello?
- Olivia Dunham is missing.

48:10.837 --> 48:11.861
What?

48:12.072 --> 48:16.168
- What do you mean, "missing"?
- It appears she's been abducted.

48:16.343 --> 48:17.537
Need I even ask?

48:19.346 --> 48:20.370
Are you there?

48:20.547 --> 48:23.778
No, yes, yes, I'm here.
Frankly, I resent the accusation.

48:23.951 --> 48:28.251
I don't make accusations,
so let me be clear.

48:28.422 --> 48:31.550
- If I find out...
- Phillip, that's enough.

48:31.725 --> 48:33.784
Now, you know how I feel
about Agent Dunham.

48:33.961 --> 48:36.930
Why would I want any harm
to come to her?

48:37.164 --> 48:42.796
Now, what do we know
about who may have taken her and why?

48:44.771 --> 48:47.467
So, what does one say
at a moment like this? Nice trip?

48:48.542 --> 48:50.305
I suppose that works well enough.

48:50.477 --> 48:52.638
I need to
get into the decompression chamber.

48:52.813 --> 48:55.748
- Of course.
- Do you have her? Agent Dunham?

48:55.916 --> 48:57.781
She didn't even put up a fight.

48:58.552 --> 49:01.919
Well, then. Let's not keep her waiting.
