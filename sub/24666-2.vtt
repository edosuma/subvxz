07:33.832 --> 07:37.387
There are few reminders of
colonial days in Montevideo,

07:37.422 --> 07:40.943
but plenty of evidence

07:40.977 --> 07:43.842

and progressive country.

07:43.877 --> 07:46.396
It was a pretty cool society.

07:46.431 --> 07:49.123
Healthcare was free,
cradle-to-grave.

07:49.158 --> 07:53.196
Uh, education free.
Also a very big medium class.

07:53.231 --> 07:54.888
That is very important
for Uruguay.

07:54.922 --> 07:56.372
- Right.
- That began to change

07:56.406 --> 07:58.339
after the '60s and '70s.

07:58.374 --> 08:00.549
One could say that
the prospect of

08:00.583 --> 08:02.516
socialist, or God forbid,
communist movements

08:02.551 --> 08:04.484
in Latin America in the '60s

08:04.518 --> 08:07.383
was an area
of great concern for the U.S.

08:07.417 --> 08:09.143
and its more
authoritarian-leaning

08:09.178 --> 08:11.180
allies in the region.

08:11.214 --> 08:14.252
So the emergence of the radical
National Liberation Movement,

08:14.286 --> 08:18.532
known as the Tupamaros, was
cause for alarm at the CIA.

08:18.567 --> 08:20.672
A lot of things happened
in the '60s

08:20.707 --> 08:22.363

08:22.398 --> 08:25.021
A lot of students, young people,

08:25.056 --> 08:27.817
were very active in politics.

08:27.852 --> 08:30.199
There weren't the low classes,
as you could say.

08:30.233 --> 08:32.056
They weren't the poor people
who were doing this.

08:32.063 --> 08:34.058
These are middle-class kids
and highly radicalized.

08:34.065 --> 08:35.445
Yeah.
At the beginning, I think,

08:35.480 --> 08:38.414
they really thought
they could change the system.

08:38.448 --> 08:41.417
With covert and overt
support by our country,

08:41.451 --> 08:43.557
a state of emergency
was declared,

08:43.592 --> 08:45.041
and a right-wing dictatorship

08:45.076 --> 08:47.250
grabbed hold of
the instruments of power

08:47.285 --> 08:49.563
launching a period of
repression that

08:49.598 --> 08:53.256
lasted from 1973 until 1985.

08:53.291 --> 08:56.536
Supported and often
guided by CIA officers

08:56.570 --> 08:58.468
trained in
what we call these days

- Professors from university.
- Troublesome intellectuals.

09:18.627 --> 09:22.078
Something like 3% to 5%
of the entire population,

No, no, no, no.

09:28.637 --> 09:29.983
They were tortured and then

09:30.017 --> 09:31.709
kept inside a prison system

09:31.743 --> 09:35.816
that was specifically designed
to pretty much destroy them.

09:35.851 --> 09:40.165

09:42.512 --> 09:45.136
forced the government
to hold elections,

was swept from power.

39:26.398 --> 39:28.227
as the mother ship
for this place.

39:28.262 --> 39:30.195
- Right?
- Man, what a spot.

39:30.229 --> 39:32.121

39:32.128 --> 39:33.898
The weather is difficult,
but it's beautiful.

39:33.923 --> 39:35.442
You'll stay the whole day.

39:35.476 --> 39:38.099
You know, you arrive at 2:00,
and you leave at 9:00.

Nice.
So, jefe, what's cooking?

Wow. Look at that,

Some suckling pig.
It's not some snack.

40:04.747 --> 40:07.128
That's no snack, man.
That's a meal right there. Wow.

40:07.163 --> 40:08.751
You want to help
in the kitchen, or...

this place been here?

40:34.501 --> 40:36.019
Like, about 12 years.

40:36.054 --> 40:38.159
It started as, like,
a shack or a house or a...

40:38.194 --> 40:41.300
It used to be a little house
on the beach with a bar.

40:41.335 --> 40:43.371
You're not allowed
to build here anymore, so

40:43.406 --> 40:47.375

on a sandbar, middle of nowhere,

41:01.666 --> 41:03.184
eating like gods.

41:03.219 --> 41:06.705
But this is what
I love about Uruguay, no?
