00:00.734 --> 00:05.437
<i>Previously on</i>
<i>two and a half men...</i>
<i>I'm dead.</i>

00:05.439 --> 00:06.872
You're in the hospital.
You had a mild heart attack.

00:06.874 --> 00:08.040
I almost died, alan.

00:08.042 --> 00:09.708
But the important thing is
you didn't.

00:09.710 --> 00:12.277
Other than you guys and my mom,
I got nobody.

00:12.279 --> 00:13.612
At least you
got jake.

00:13.614 --> 00:15.080
I want to have a kid of my own.

00:15.082 --> 00:18.283
You are obviously more
than qualified.
Thank you.

00:18.285 --> 00:19.685
I'd start looking
at golden retriever puppies,

00:19.687 --> 00:21.086
'cause there's no way
you're getting a baby.

00:21.088 --> 00:22.888
You're a single guy,
and the system

00:22.890 --> 00:24.356
Is really geared
towards married couples.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.759
Alan harper,
will you marry me?

00:29.129 --> 00:31.163
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

00:31.165 --> 00:33.432
Wait. You seriously
want to marry me?

00:33.434 --> 00:34.833
Yes.

00:34.835 --> 00:36.869
Alan jerome harper,

00:36.871 --> 00:39.438
Would you be my wi...?

00:39.440 --> 00:42.775
Hus...?

00:42.777 --> 00:44.109
Life buddy?

00:44.111 --> 00:46.245
Okay, I'm a little confused.

00:46.247 --> 00:50.249
And not like the time I-I got
that massage from that lady-boy.

00:51.951 --> 00:53.952
Look, I want
to adopt a kid,

00:53.954 --> 00:57.056
And the quickest way for me
to do that is to get married.

00:57.058 --> 00:59.224
And if I'm gonna
settle for someone,

00:59.226 --> 01:01.060
It might as well be you.

01:01.062 --> 01:03.896
That's exactly what
my first wife said.

01:03.898 --> 01:06.665
Listen, I-I know
this sounds crazy,

01:06.667 --> 01:10.202
But you would be doing me
the biggest favor of my life.

01:10.204 --> 01:11.703
Walden, there are
literally millions of women

01:11.705 --> 01:13.839
Who would marry you
at the drop of a hat.

01:13.841 --> 01:15.441
Yeah, but I wouldn't be
half as happy

01:15.443 --> 01:17.476
With any of them
as I would be with you.

01:17.478 --> 01:19.244
Go on.

01:21.848 --> 01:24.983
When-when I think of
the ten things I want in a wife,

01:24.985 --> 01:26.785
You have nine of them.

01:26.787 --> 01:29.021
You're my best friend,
you're trustworthy,

01:29.023 --> 01:32.324
You're loving, you're smart,
you'll never leave me.

01:32.326 --> 01:34.993
Married or not, till
death do us part.

01:34.995 --> 01:37.162
You're funny,
you're understanding.

01:37.164 --> 01:39.698
You don't care
if I leave the toilet seat up.

01:39.700 --> 01:41.500
I actually prefer it.

01:41.502 --> 01:43.635
Although, the other night,
I forgot it was up,

01:43.637 --> 01:45.237
And I had a surprise
splash-down.

01:46.506 --> 01:50.142
I was like a
turtle on its back.

01:50.144 --> 01:51.310
Right there. That's another one.

01:51.312 --> 01:52.511
As long as you're around,

01:52.513 --> 01:55.147
I will never be the most
awkward guy in the room.

01:55.149 --> 01:56.915
So, what's the one thing

01:56.917 --> 01:59.818
You want in a wife
that I don't have?

01:59.820 --> 02:01.687
Oh. Right, right.

02:01.689 --> 02:04.590
I-I do not have
one of those.

02:04.592 --> 02:06.358
I barely have one of these.

02:09.295 --> 02:11.296
I mean, how would
this work exactly?

02:11.298 --> 02:13.832
I mean, we're gonna
pretend to be a couple?

02:13.834 --> 02:15.501
We wouldn't pretend.

02:15.503 --> 02:18.504
We're actually going
to be a same-sex married couple.

02:18.506 --> 02:22.107
And like most married couples,
we will not have sex.

02:23.076 --> 02:25.811
Not even on my birthday?

02:25.813 --> 02:29.548
Sorry, sorry... Flashback
to the first wife.

02:29.550 --> 02:31.783
So, so, I can have
crazy, anonymous sex

02:31.785 --> 02:33.685
With any woman I want?

02:33.687 --> 02:36.955
No. You will still be you.

02:36.957 --> 02:39.424
Oh.

02:41.227 --> 02:43.829
Mr. Alan harper-schmidt.

02:45.398 --> 02:47.466
Dr. Alan schmidt.

02:47.468 --> 02:48.800
What are you doing?

02:48.802 --> 02:51.937
Oh, just trying
to see what sounds best.

02:51.939 --> 02:53.839
Yes, mr. And mr. Harper-schmidt,

02:53.841 --> 02:55.374
Welcome back
to the four seasons.

02:55.376 --> 02:57.342
Your ocean front suite is ready.

02:57.344 --> 02:59.545
Okay, cut the schmidt.

02:59.547 --> 03:02.114
Oh, yeah, I'd have
to put up with that schmidt.

03:02.116 --> 03:04.116
But you know what?
I'm gonna own it.

03:04.118 --> 03:05.684
I don't give a schmidt.

03:05.686 --> 03:08.220
What are you saying?

03:08.222 --> 03:10.856
I'm saying, yes, I'll marry you,
you big dumb schmidt.

03:10.858 --> 03:12.691
(laughing)

03:12.693 --> 03:14.960
Ah.

03:14.962 --> 03:18.263
Oh, please tell me that's
chapstick in your pocket.

03:18.265 --> 03:21.133
â™ª men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men â™ª

03:21.135 --> 03:23.969
â™ª ah.
â™ª men.
â™ª men.

03:28.308 --> 03:29.141
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

03:29.143 --> 03:30.375
(doorbell rings)

03:30.377 --> 03:30.976
Hi, mom.
Thanks for coming over.

03:30.978 --> 03:33.412
What is so important

03:33.414 --> 03:36.582
That I had to leave halfway
through my bikini wax?

03:36.584 --> 03:38.784
I look like a black
and white cookie.

03:40.720 --> 03:44.590
Wow. In one fell swoop, there
goes cookies and vaginas.

03:45.959 --> 03:48.627
What's going on?

03:48.629 --> 03:50.862
Is this another
intervention?

03:50.864 --> 03:54.833
For the millionth time, I do not
have a drinking problem.

03:54.835 --> 03:57.135
No, evelyn.
It's-it's a celebration.

03:57.137 --> 03:58.337
Well, in that case,

03:58.339 --> 04:00.539
I'll have a double martini
and hold the vermouth.

04:00.541 --> 04:02.541
Hello. I'm robin.
I'm walden's mother.

04:02.543 --> 04:04.376
Oh, how nice
to finally meet you.

04:04.378 --> 04:07.646
You have a wonderful son
and amazing breasts.

04:07.648 --> 04:09.214
Who did them?

04:09.216 --> 04:10.482
God?

04:10.484 --> 04:12.517
Well, he's still the best.

04:12.519 --> 04:15.587
Although dr. Schenkman
runs a close second.

04:15.589 --> 04:18.323
They are lovely.

04:18.325 --> 04:21.627
Okay, can everyone stop talking
about my mom's boobs? God.

04:21.629 --> 04:25.030
Oh, my god, that's why I had
so many friends in high school.

04:25.032 --> 04:28.500
So, what's
the big announcement?

04:28.502 --> 04:30.569
Uh... Well...
(chuckles)

04:30.571 --> 04:32.571
Alan and I...

04:32.573 --> 04:34.573
We're getting married!

04:34.575 --> 04:36.908
Dude! What the hell! We
agreed I was gonna say it.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.543
Sorry, sorry.
I'm just so excited.

04:38.545 --> 04:42.648
Uh, no offense, but
can't you do better than alan?

04:43.683 --> 04:46.685
Back up. You are marrying him?

04:46.687 --> 04:48.687
Yup.

04:48.689 --> 04:50.656
Ow! What was
that for?

04:50.658 --> 04:52.424
For marrying zippy.

04:52.426 --> 04:54.092
Hey! Why are you
hitting me?!

04:54.094 --> 04:56.561
For being zippy.

04:56.563 --> 04:58.363
This sounds great,
except for one thing.

04:58.365 --> 04:59.798
You guys aren't gay.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.500
No, we're not gay.

05:01.502 --> 05:03.302
We are getting
married because...

05:03.304 --> 05:05.704
It'll make it easier
for him to adopt a child!

05:05.706 --> 05:07.372
Aah, come on!

05:07.374 --> 05:08.774
Uh, thank you, berta.

05:08.776 --> 05:10.342
Robin:
Hold on.

05:10.344 --> 05:11.677
You want a child?

05:11.679 --> 05:13.712
Yes. I've been doing
a lot of thinking

05:13.714 --> 05:15.914
About my life,
and I believe

05:15.916 --> 05:18.450
That having a kid would
add more meaning to it.

05:18.452 --> 05:20.719
Parenthood can be
very rewarding.

05:20.721 --> 05:22.821
Some of the time.

05:24.457 --> 05:26.558
So, this marriage
is just a sham?

05:26.560 --> 05:28.994
I didn't March in all
of those gay rights parades

05:28.996 --> 05:32.531
So you guys could make a mockery
of our hard-won civil liberties.

05:32.533 --> 05:33.732
You marched in
those parades

05:33.734 --> 05:35.701
So you could get drunk
and pick up chicks.

05:35.703 --> 05:39.204
Hard-won chicks.

05:39.206 --> 05:41.573
All right, look, we're not
making a mockery of anything,

05:41.575 --> 05:44.209
And I get the challenges
that gay couples face,

05:44.211 --> 05:47.245
But I-I also know that there
are a lot of kids out there

05:47.247 --> 05:49.314
That are just looking
for a good home,

05:49.316 --> 05:51.249
And I think we
can provide that.

05:51.251 --> 05:53.251
And I get health insurance.

05:53.253 --> 05:55.487
You guys are lucky
you're in california.

05:55.489 --> 05:58.223
In some states, they still don't
let gay couples get married

05:58.225 --> 05:59.624
Or adopt kids.

05:59.626 --> 06:01.293
You know, when
I was in utah,

06:01.295 --> 06:04.663
I vomited on a police officer,
and I was arrested.

06:05.631 --> 06:08.166
Simply for being gay.

06:09.969 --> 06:12.003
Wow, this is a lot to take in.

06:12.005 --> 06:15.073
My son is going to get married
and have a child with...

06:16.442 --> 06:19.878
Oh, god, where...
Where did I go wrong?

06:22.014 --> 06:24.216
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

06:24.218 --> 06:28.019
Oh, there he is,
my same-sex shorty.

06:29.389 --> 06:31.823
My friend with no benefits.

06:33.192 --> 06:35.127
My boo.

06:35.129 --> 06:38.597
You know, I do have 99 problems,
and you're all of them.

06:40.666 --> 06:42.134
What's all this?

06:42.136 --> 06:43.468
Uh, oh, I'm, uh...

06:43.470 --> 06:45.637
I'm making a dream
board for our wedding.

06:45.639 --> 06:47.205
Uh, there's also
a pinterest page,

06:47.207 --> 06:49.975
Or you can go to: Alan
and walden's big day dot com.

06:49.977 --> 06:52.444
Yeah, I got the link
you sent me.

06:52.446 --> 06:54.980
Uh, I really loved
the photoshopped picture

06:54.982 --> 06:57.182
Of both us peeking
around the same tree.

06:59.819 --> 07:01.987
However, you know,

07:01.989 --> 07:04.790
We're not doing, like,
a big, lavish wedding.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.358
Oh, okay, I get it.

07:06.360 --> 07:08.093
You know,
small destination wedding.

07:08.095 --> 07:11.029
Just the two of us, the beach,
wearing leis around our necks,

07:11.031 --> 07:13.765
Matching linen shirts,
sand tickling our toes.

07:14.801 --> 07:16.768
Seagulls flying overhead.

07:17.904 --> 07:20.939
Ca-kaw! Ca-kaw!

07:20.941 --> 07:24.276
And where do you see this
happening?

07:24.278 --> 07:27.746
Well, obviously,
there's hawaii and cabo.

07:27.748 --> 07:29.247
Um,

07:29.249 --> 07:31.149
I'd be happy
with either one of those.

07:31.151 --> 07:34.119
Um, but I hear that greece is
fabulous this time of year.

07:34.121 --> 07:36.621
And just fyi, mykonos is very
friendly to same-sex couples.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.156
<i>Opa!</i>

07:39.125 --> 07:42.027
Nopa!

07:42.029 --> 07:43.929
We're getting married
in the courthouse.

07:43.931 --> 07:46.765
Please tell me "the courthouse"
is a chic bar in ibiza.

07:46.767 --> 07:48.733
No, it's a rundown courthouse

07:48.735 --> 07:50.702
Around the corner
from the jiffy lube.

07:50.704 --> 07:51.970
We'll pay 50 bucks,

07:51.972 --> 07:53.605
We'll do some paperwork,

07:53.607 --> 07:55.407
And if you're good,
we'll go outside

07:55.409 --> 07:57.843
To the food truck,
and I'll buy you a gyro.

07:57.845 --> 08:00.445
Opa!

08:00.447 --> 08:02.080
Oh.

08:02.082 --> 08:04.282
Okay. I see.

08:04.284 --> 08:06.218
What's wrong?

08:06.220 --> 08:08.353
Nothing.

08:08.355 --> 08:10.355
(sighs)
talk to me.

08:10.357 --> 08:12.023
No, it's fine.

08:12.025 --> 08:14.092
You know, I just
wanted to make sure

08:14.094 --> 08:15.894
This whole thing
was special for us,

08:15.896 --> 08:18.163
For you, but, you know,
it's no big deal.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.599
I'm sure we can
still make it special.

08:20.601 --> 08:22.634
Maybe, uh... Maybe jenny
can take some pictures

08:22.636 --> 08:24.636
On her iphone.

08:24.638 --> 08:26.905
Alan, come on.

08:26.907 --> 08:28.974
Don't touch me.

08:31.444 --> 08:34.045
Look, this isn't about us.

08:34.047 --> 08:36.381
It's about bringing
a kid into our lives.

08:36.383 --> 08:38.617
It's a simple
business transaction,

08:38.619 --> 08:41.253
Like paying an electric bill,
or buying dinner, or...

08:41.255 --> 08:43.255
Writing a rent check.

08:43.257 --> 08:46.758
Stop me when I land on something
you've actually done.

08:46.760 --> 08:48.126
I just got excited

08:48.128 --> 08:49.828
Because I've never had the
wedding I always dreamed of.

08:49.830 --> 08:54.332
Right, the wedding
that every little boy dreams of.

08:54.334 --> 08:59.104
You know, we still need
to get each other rings.

08:59.106 --> 09:01.306
We can just get something
online.

09:01.308 --> 09:04.910
Or we could go into
beverly hills and have brunch,

09:04.912 --> 09:06.978
And go ring shopping together.

09:06.980 --> 09:09.347
Really?

09:09.349 --> 09:10.916
Sure.

09:10.918 --> 09:13.585
Because I do have ideas.

09:16.389 --> 09:17.822
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

09:17.824 --> 09:19.558
Alan:
Hey, berta,

09:19.560 --> 09:21.226
Do we have any carrots?

09:21.228 --> 09:24.162
Oh, wait. I've got 14 karats
of white gold

09:24.164 --> 09:25.730
Right here.

09:25.732 --> 09:29.034
You'll make a beautiful
bride, zippy.

09:29.036 --> 09:31.770
Hey.
Hey, there's my future
baby daddy!

09:32.939 --> 09:35.574
If I got to listen to this,
I got to be a lot higher.

09:38.511 --> 09:41.580
Hey, uh, I got some paperwork
for you to sign.

09:41.582 --> 09:43.882
Oh, uh, and I've got some
paperwork for you to sign.

09:43.884 --> 09:46.484
Guess it's true. Married couples
do start to think alike.

09:46.486 --> 09:50.755
Maybe soon, we'll start to
look alike, he said hopefully.

09:50.757 --> 09:53.525
It's the application form
for our marriage license.

09:53.527 --> 09:56.127
Oh, look at you.
Yeah.

09:56.129 --> 09:58.063
I guess somebody's
gonna get that money

09:58.065 --> 09:59.965
For that mani-pedi
he wants after all.

09:59.967 --> 10:01.866
Ah, you spoil me.

10:01.868 --> 10:04.202
No, I'm just trying to be
a good business partner.

10:04.204 --> 10:07.105
The johnson to
your johnson.

10:07.107 --> 10:08.373
Wait, that-that
didn't come out right.

10:08.375 --> 10:10.442
So, uh... So what do
you need me to sign?

10:10.444 --> 10:12.911
Uh, just this.

10:12.913 --> 10:14.946
Oh. What's that?
(laughs)

10:14.948 --> 10:17.415
Oh, it's a simple dissolution
of services agreement.

10:18.684 --> 10:22.153
Oh! Oh, you-you mean,
like a... Like a prenup?

10:22.155 --> 10:24.522
Yup. So, it's not a big deal.

10:24.524 --> 10:28.126
Just go ahead and sign it,
he said hopefully.

10:28.128 --> 10:30.395
Why do we need a prenup?

10:30.397 --> 10:31.930
And here we go.

10:31.932 --> 10:33.264
Uh...

10:33.266 --> 10:35.133
When couples get married,

10:35.135 --> 10:37.002
Finances become complicated,

10:37.004 --> 10:39.304
And this just simplifies it.

10:39.306 --> 10:40.772
Oh, does it?

10:40.774 --> 10:42.741
'cause it seems like
it's pretty simple right now.

10:42.743 --> 10:43.942
You don't trust me.

10:43.944 --> 10:45.677
Okay, that's not true at all.

10:45.679 --> 10:46.911
Isn't it?

10:46.913 --> 10:49.314
I mean, is this what
you really think of me?

10:49.316 --> 10:52.250
That I'm some kind
of gold digger?

10:52.252 --> 10:55.854
Okay, yes, I have lived here
four years rent-free.

10:55.856 --> 10:58.223
Look, why do you have
to make this difficult?

10:58.225 --> 11:00.692
You know, why do you make
everything so difficult?

11:00.694 --> 11:03.161
It's like yesterday at brunch,
when you sent back the champagne

11:03.163 --> 11:06.931
Because the bubbles didn't taste
like "a mouthful of stars."

11:06.933 --> 11:09.834
If it doesn't explode in
your mouth, what's the point?

11:09.836 --> 11:13.772
You said that to the waiter,
too, and it was troubling then!

11:13.774 --> 11:16.508
Look, I'm just trying
to protect my assets.

11:16.510 --> 11:19.277
Oh-oh, yeah? Well, then maybe
I should protect my assets.
You know,

11:19.279 --> 11:21.613
Don't worry, I'm pretty sure
that your vhs copy

11:21.615 --> 11:23.748
Of <i>dirty dancing</i>
<i>and your complete collection</i>

11:23.750 --> 11:26.418
Of <i>ghostbusters</i> trading cards
are safe.

11:26.420 --> 11:30.088
I am a collector
of '80s movie memorabilia.

11:30.090 --> 11:33.658
And hobby mocking is not
an attractive color on you.

11:34.727 --> 11:36.561
Hobby mocker.

11:36.563 --> 11:39.698
I also have one other asset
that you cannot have,

11:39.700 --> 11:41.199
My dignity.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.434
Your dignity?!
Mm-hmm.

11:42.436 --> 11:44.069
Your dignity...?
Yes.

11:44.071 --> 11:46.004
Really? 'cause I'm pretty sure
that the security guard

11:46.006 --> 11:48.073
At the shopping mall had
to remove the bench

11:48.075 --> 11:51.109
From outside of victoria's
secret because of you!

11:52.144 --> 11:54.079
Mall flogger!

11:54.081 --> 11:56.815
I got to tell you,
I'm having a lot of
second thoughts right now.

11:56.817 --> 11:59.284
Really? Because this is exactly
where I want to be in my life,
mm-hmm.

11:59.286 --> 12:02.353
Begging a 47-year-old man
to marry me.

12:02.355 --> 12:04.823
Now sign the prenup!

12:04.825 --> 12:06.825
I agreed to marry you,
but that doesn't mean you get

12:06.827 --> 12:08.426
To shove whatever you want
down my throat

12:08.428 --> 12:10.061
And expect me to swallow it!

12:10.063 --> 12:13.064
Do-do you... Do you even hear

12:13.066 --> 12:15.400
The words that you are saying?!

12:15.402 --> 12:18.269
How about these words?
The wedding's off!

12:19.572 --> 12:20.939
(crying)

12:22.842 --> 12:26.745
I can't even get alan harper
to marry me.

12:27.713 --> 12:30.482
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

12:33.853 --> 12:36.387
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª
boy, this better be important.

12:36.389 --> 12:38.890
I just saw you
two days ago.

12:38.892 --> 12:41.626
Walden and I broke up.
The-the wedding is off.

12:41.628 --> 12:42.694
Oh, alan.

12:42.696 --> 12:44.696
You had a rich husband
on the hook

12:44.698 --> 12:46.231
And you couldn't reel him in.

12:47.199 --> 12:48.800
What happened?

12:48.802 --> 12:51.703
Well, he asked me to sign
a prenup and I refused.

12:51.705 --> 12:54.305
Well, of course you refused.

12:54.307 --> 12:58.143
The woman I paid to raise you
did not raise a fool.

12:58.145 --> 12:59.644
Mom, I don't want his money.

13:01.814 --> 13:04.883
Never say that again.

13:04.885 --> 13:06.217
Is that a new ring?

13:06.219 --> 13:08.052
Feels like cartier.

13:08.054 --> 13:10.588
Yes, it is.
And you know who gave it to me?

13:10.590 --> 13:11.956
My rich husband.

13:11.958 --> 13:15.460
When marty and I married, the
only thing I was willing to sign

13:15.462 --> 13:18.630
Was his "do not resuscitate"
order.

13:18.632 --> 13:21.633
Walden says this wedding is just
a-a business transaction.

13:21.635 --> 13:23.568
H-how many business
transactions end

13:23.570 --> 13:26.671
With the release of
grand monarch butterflies?

13:26.673 --> 13:28.807
Darling, it is
just business.

13:28.809 --> 13:31.810
He's using you
to get what he wants,

13:31.812 --> 13:34.679
And you should be using him
to get what you want:

13:34.681 --> 13:36.681
Financial security.

13:36.683 --> 13:38.416
I'm not doing it for
financial security.

13:38.418 --> 13:40.084
Walden genuinely
wants a child,

13:40.086 --> 13:43.054
The same way that I wanted
jake and-and you wanted...

13:43.056 --> 13:45.089
Charlie.

13:45.091 --> 13:46.925
I just thought that
after four years together

13:46.927 --> 13:48.526
That he would trust me
when it comes to money.

13:48.528 --> 13:52.397
Oh, darling, after 47 years,
I don't trust you.

13:52.399 --> 13:55.333
Maybe, uh, a-a
prenup is justified.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.068
Maybe I am just a sponge.

13:57.070 --> 13:59.270
A-a-a parasite.

13:59.272 --> 14:03.541
And-and he tolerates me
because he's my best friend.

14:04.476 --> 14:05.610
And I've let him down,

14:05.612 --> 14:08.413
And all I want to
do is make him happy.

14:08.415 --> 14:10.415
"best friend."

14:10.417 --> 14:12.083
"happy."

14:12.085 --> 14:14.786
I just have no idea where
you got these warped views

14:14.788 --> 14:16.321
On marriage.

14:16.323 --> 14:17.856
He wouldn't sign a prenup?

14:17.858 --> 14:21.192
No, he got all upset
and he threw a hissy fit.

14:21.194 --> 14:23.661
"you don't trust me.
The wedding's off.

14:23.663 --> 14:27.198
I'm going to
ibiza by myself."

14:27.200 --> 14:29.400
Let's face it, the man
is simply not your equal.

14:29.402 --> 14:31.669
If the two of you were
on a plane that crashed

14:31.671 --> 14:35.506
In the mountains, alan would be
the first person eaten.

14:35.508 --> 14:37.108
On the other hand,

14:37.110 --> 14:38.843
You're handsome,
successful, smart.

14:38.845 --> 14:41.279
You would be eaten last.

14:41.281 --> 14:44.883
You're just saying I'd be eaten
last 'cause you're my mom.

14:44.885 --> 14:47.819
Well, listen, I know you're
serious about this child thing,

14:47.821 --> 14:51.723
So I mentioned your situation
to a very cute intern at work.

14:51.725 --> 14:54.692
You didn't.
Oh, jessica's very amenable
to striking a business deal.

14:54.694 --> 14:56.027
(sighs)
plus,

14:56.029 --> 14:58.296
She's already visited
dr. Schenkman,

14:58.298 --> 14:59.764
If you know what I mean.

14:59.766 --> 15:02.700
Mom, that's exactly
what I don't want.

15:02.702 --> 15:04.369
I don't even
know this jess...

15:04.371 --> 15:07.105
Holy schenkman.

15:07.107 --> 15:09.107
Look, I-I w...

15:13.112 --> 15:16.614
No, she'd be eaten first.

15:16.616 --> 15:19.717
Look, no, I want
someone that I can trust.

15:19.719 --> 15:22.086
That's why I picked alan
in the first place.

15:22.088 --> 15:24.088
How can you possibly trust him?

15:24.090 --> 15:26.224
He siphons gas out of your car.

15:26.226 --> 15:27.625
Technically, I never caught him.

15:27.627 --> 15:29.027
I just assumed that he did it

15:29.029 --> 15:30.695
'cause the garden hose smelled
like gas

15:30.697 --> 15:32.363
And one time he burped
near a candle

15:32.365 --> 15:34.565
And it lit the couch on fire.

15:34.567 --> 15:37.602
I don't know why you ever
let alan live with you
in the first place.

15:37.604 --> 15:39.504
Uh, for starters,
he saved my life.

15:39.506 --> 15:42.173
And... He's been
there for me,

15:42.175 --> 15:46.778
Every time that I needed him
and even times when I didn't.

15:46.780 --> 15:49.180
The bottom line is...

15:49.182 --> 15:51.249
He's my best friend.

15:51.251 --> 15:52.350
Jessica could be
your best friend.

15:52.352 --> 15:54.485
I'm not going out with jessica.

15:54.487 --> 15:56.087
Fine. I get it.

15:56.089 --> 15:58.423
I do have another intern
that you might like better.

15:58.425 --> 16:00.325
His name is derek.
He does pilates...

16:00.327 --> 16:02.160
Mom, I'm not gay!

16:02.162 --> 16:04.295
I-I just want to marry a man.

16:04.297 --> 16:07.765
Why is that so difficult
to understand?

16:07.767 --> 16:09.834
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª

16:10.769 --> 16:12.937
Hey.

16:12.939 --> 16:15.106
Hey.

16:15.108 --> 16:17.709
Listen...
About earlier...

16:17.711 --> 16:20.712
Uh, that-that's,
that's my fault.

16:20.714 --> 16:23.715
I-I totally get why I need
to sign a prenup.

16:23.717 --> 16:26.384
I mean, there's guys standing
at freeway onramps

16:26.386 --> 16:28.386
That make more money than I do.

16:28.388 --> 16:31.289
You know what,
you don't need to sign it.

16:31.291 --> 16:33.291
Despite my mother's objections

16:33.293 --> 16:35.159
And despite everything
I've learned from...

16:35.161 --> 16:37.362
Two seasons of <i>basketball wives,</i>

16:37.364 --> 16:39.364
I trust you completely.

16:39.366 --> 16:40.965
That's nice, but, uh,

16:40.967 --> 16:43.735
I already signed it
and sent it to your attorney.

16:43.737 --> 16:44.736
Really?

16:44.738 --> 16:47.205
Thank you. I-I owe you.

16:47.207 --> 16:48.606
You owe me nothing.

16:48.608 --> 16:50.608
I mean, other than two dollars
for the envelope

16:50.610 --> 16:52.977
And $1.75 for postage.

16:52.979 --> 16:54.579
Nothing for gas?

16:54.581 --> 16:56.647
No, I just filled up.

17:01.754 --> 17:04.355
Will you still be my husband?

17:04.357 --> 17:06.657
You know I can't quit you.

17:06.659 --> 17:07.925
Listen, I-I know
this isn't the wedding

17:07.927 --> 17:09.327
That you've always dreamed of,

17:09.329 --> 17:12.163
But I-I got a little surprise
for you for the ceremony.

17:12.165 --> 17:15.500
Tell me vera wang
started making tuxes.

17:15.502 --> 17:16.901
Even better.

17:16.903 --> 17:21.072
â™ª when a man loves another man

17:22.674 --> 17:24.675
â™ª can't keep his mind
on nothing else... â™ª

17:24.677 --> 17:28.379
Oh... My... God.

17:28.381 --> 17:30.348
It's like you live
inside my dreams.

17:30.350 --> 17:33.184
Happy wife, happy life.

17:33.186 --> 17:35.119
Uh, fellas, can
we get this going?

17:35.121 --> 17:37.321
There's a lot of gay couples
here who'd like to get married

17:37.323 --> 17:39.657
Before the supreme court
changes its mind.

17:39.659 --> 17:41.993
Plus, this place
is crawling with cops,

17:41.995 --> 17:44.462
And I've got six months
to a year hidden in my purse.

17:44.464 --> 17:47.598
â™ª when a man loves
another man â™ª

17:47.600 --> 17:49.167
Kill it, bolton.

17:52.137 --> 17:53.971
Hello, michael.

17:53.973 --> 17:56.207
You know, I have a vibrator
named after you.

17:56.209 --> 17:57.775
Well, that's very flattering.

17:57.777 --> 17:59.310
Would you like me to sign it?

17:59.312 --> 18:01.312
I have a special pen.

18:02.714 --> 18:03.781
What a coincidence.

18:03.783 --> 18:05.450
I have a bit of
a nasty habit

18:05.452 --> 18:08.186
Of putting the tips
of pens into my mouth.

18:11.023 --> 18:12.690
We're here
to join walden schmidt

18:12.692 --> 18:15.359
And alan harper
in legal marriage.

18:15.361 --> 18:17.295
Have you two written
your own vows?

18:17.297 --> 18:18.563
No, the, uh, standard...
The standard

18:18.565 --> 18:21.199
"for richer, for poorer"
actually fits us quite well.

18:21.201 --> 18:22.233
Actually,

18:22.235 --> 18:24.669
I've written
a little something down.

18:24.671 --> 18:26.370
What? You didn't.

18:26.372 --> 18:27.672
I wanted to surprise you.

18:27.674 --> 18:29.674
(chuckles)
vows and bolton?

18:29.676 --> 18:30.875
â™ª when a man...

18:30.877 --> 18:32.443
Not the cue, bolton.

18:35.614 --> 18:37.081
Today,

18:37.083 --> 18:38.916
I'm marrying
my best friend.

18:38.918 --> 18:40.585
Do not cry.

18:40.587 --> 18:43.488
Keep it together, alan.
(clears throat)

18:43.490 --> 18:46.491
In the last four years,
I've been through a lot.

18:46.493 --> 18:50.695
Uh, there's been good times
and bad times.

18:50.697 --> 18:54.198
But through it all,
you were there.

18:54.200 --> 18:58.102
And I can't imagine
a future without you.

18:59.838 --> 19:03.007
I guess what I'm trying
to say is...

19:03.009 --> 19:04.675
I love you.

19:04.677 --> 19:06.377
(voice breaking):
I love you, too.

19:09.581 --> 19:14.485
This is the gayest wedding
I've ever been to.

19:14.487 --> 19:16.487
I think it's beaut...
Wh-whose hand is on my ass?

19:16.489 --> 19:18.656
Sorry.
Sorry.

19:18.658 --> 19:20.625
Walden,

19:20.627 --> 19:23.628
Do you take alan to be
your lawfully wedded husband?

19:24.596 --> 19:26.764
I do.

19:26.766 --> 19:29.333
And, alan, do you take walden
to be your...

19:29.335 --> 19:30.801
Try and stop me.

19:30.803 --> 19:33.237
I now
pronounce you married.

19:35.107 --> 19:36.040
You may kiss.

19:36.042 --> 19:37.375
Oh. Oh, yeah.

19:37.377 --> 19:39.844
Um, kiss. Right.
(chuckles)

19:39.846 --> 19:41.045
Let's...

19:41.047 --> 19:42.380
Aw, what the hell.

19:42.382 --> 19:44.015
(chuckles)

19:46.919 --> 19:51.489
â™ª when a man loves
another man... â™ª

19:54.826 --> 19:56.427
â™ª <i>men.</i> â™ª
morning.

19:56.429 --> 20:00.831
Hey. There's the old
balls and chain.

20:01.934 --> 20:03.834
How was your
wedding night?

20:03.836 --> 20:05.369
Much like my first one.

20:05.371 --> 20:08.439
I spent it
masturbating alone.

20:08.441 --> 20:10.107
You're the only guy I know

20:10.109 --> 20:13.778
That would register
for lotion and tissues.

20:13.780 --> 20:16.314
That was some party
last night, huh?

20:16.316 --> 20:19.250
Yeah, it must have been.
I woke up out here.

20:19.252 --> 20:21.519
And I'm pretty sure I'm
wearing jenny's underwear.

20:21.521 --> 20:23.187
Yeah.

20:23.189 --> 20:27.225
The whole evening's
a little fuzzy for me, too.

20:28.627 --> 20:30.761
The last thing I remember
is you doing body shots

20:30.763 --> 20:33.564
Off of michael bolton.

20:33.566 --> 20:36.834
All of us did body shots
off of michael bolton.

20:43.075 --> 20:44.475
Even our moms got along.

20:44.477 --> 20:46.310
I wasn't sure they'd
click at first, but...

20:46.312 --> 20:48.312
In the end, they
came together.

20:48.314 --> 20:50.648
â™ª when a man

20:50.650 --> 20:53.718
â™ª loves two women...
