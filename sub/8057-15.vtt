We saw the bus stop

00:04.337 --> 00:06.943
where a young Barack Obama used
to sit and wait for the bus.

00:07.007 --> 00:08.645
Theoretically.
It's possible.

00:08.708 --> 00:11.882
Then, we went and visited
Honolulu City Hall.

00:11.945 --> 00:13.288
(GASPS) Shut up.
I know.

00:13.346 --> 00:15.257
Oh, my God. What was it like?
It was amazing.

00:15.315 --> 00:16.794
Well, it looked amazing.
But it was closed.

00:16.850 --> 00:17.988
Oh, my God. Bummer.

00:18.051 --> 00:19.086
Okay, I have presents.

00:19.285 --> 00:20.320
Um...

00:20.387 --> 00:22.663
Chris, we got you
an acai tree.

00:22.722 --> 00:25.202
Because the acai berry
is a super food.

00:25.258 --> 00:27.033
And a super gift.

00:27.093 --> 00:29.300
Donna, we got you some coffee
because you said, and I quote,

00:29.362 --> 00:32.036
"I like my coffee like I like my men.
Dark, rich, and full-bodied."

00:32.098 --> 00:33.304
Yes, indeed.

00:33.366 --> 00:36.404

rare Hawaiian fertility tea.

00:36.469 --> 00:38.642
Guaranteed to help you have a baby.
That's so nice.

00:38.705 --> 00:39.706
Where did you find that?

00:39.773 --> 00:41.810
Well, the bus boy
at our restaurant,

00:41.875 --> 00:44.151
um, told us about a guy who
we met in a parking lot.

00:44.210 --> 00:46.417
And then, he had a backpack
full of this stuff.

00:46.479 --> 00:48.322
And I'm just realizing
now that it's not tea

00:48.381 --> 00:49.451
and I'm going
to throw it away.

00:49.516 --> 00:53.328

Hawaiian God of Anger.

00:53.386 --> 00:55.866

LESLIE: We did not forget Jerry.
Right, right, right.

00:58.858 --> 01:04.069
We got Jerry some ear
buds and a bag of peanuts

01:04.129 --> 01:05.700
and a SkyMall catalog.

01:05.765 --> 01:08.644
Same thing you got me from
your trip to Washington.

01:08.701 --> 01:12.706

01:16.209 --> 01:19.782
April, as requested, we threw that
box you gave us into that volcano.

01:20.513 --> 01:21.617
Thank you.

01:21.681 --> 01:23.251
Andy, as you
requested,

01:23.316 --> 01:26.388
we got you a three-pack of
white T-shirts from Target.

and I'll read it later.

09:36.509 --> 09:39.547
No. Andy found it, and he's going
to tell you about it right now.

09:39.612 --> 09:40.716
Go, babe.

09:40.780 --> 09:43.954
Uh, it's the Redwood
Music Program.

09:44.250 --> 09:47.697
It's an after-school music
class for at-risk kids.

09:47.753 --> 09:48.925
It will keep them
off the street.

09:48.988 --> 09:52.094
Whoa! And the streets, as
you know, are dangerous.

09:52.158 --> 09:55.765
Example, I fell in a sewer grate once.
I was there all day.

09:55.828 --> 09:59.605
In conclusion, we cannot let our
children live in the sewer any longer.

09:59.665 --> 10:02.976
Redwood Music Program.
Go. Your Honor. Amen.

10:03.803 --> 10:05.111
That's a great idea.
Yeah.

10:05.171 --> 10:08.118
Anyone else come across
anything good? Tom?

10:10.076 --> 10:12.317
Um, yeah.
I've got a good one.

10:13.379 --> 10:15.916
It's called
The Clean Sheet Foundation.

10:17.116 --> 10:18.618
That's my pick.

10:18.684 --> 10:23.531
They provide legal assistance to the KKK.
This is your pick?

10:23.623 --> 10:25.933
<i>Yeah. Can you pass
the hon-buns'?</i>

10:25.992 --> 10:27.994
<i>Perd Hapley
is here today.</i>

10:28.060 --> 10:29.801
<i>Or as Perd would say,</i>

10:29.862 --> 10:34.106
<i>”My name is Perd Hapley, and
the person I see here today</i>

10:34.333 --> 10:35.710
"is me." (LAUGHS)
(ALL LAUGHING)

10:37.303 --> 10:39.305
Everyone seems to
be laughing now.

10:39.672 --> 10:42.448
Do you see what is happening
with Chris and Shauna?

10:42.508 --> 10:44.749
They are flirting like crazy.

10:44.810 --> 10:46.585
It's disgusting.
They're in public.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.125
That's called
a conversation.

10:48.180 --> 10:51.286
Ron, there are
no ficuses. Okay?

10:51.350 --> 10:54.331
I wanted to ask Chris
to be the father of my baby.

10:54.387 --> 10:55.661
Good God.

10:55.721 --> 10:59.362
And the metaphor you chose was
"planting ficuses in your front yard"?

10:59.425 --> 11:01.063
I was going to wait until
he was single to ask him,

11:01.127 --> 11:02.470
but now, he's flirting
with Shauna again.

11:02.528 --> 11:04.269
What do I do?

11:05.631 --> 11:06.871
It's been nice
talking to you.

11:06.932 --> 11:07.933
What?

11:09.068 --> 11:11.275
Maybe I should
just do impressions.

11:11.337 --> 11:13.248
(FOREIGN ACCENT)
"I am Borat." There's one.

11:13.305 --> 11:15.478
But I need to do someone
that no one has heard before.

11:15.541 --> 11:17.179
Like, I don't know,
Neve Campbell?

11:17.243 --> 11:18.381
What does Neve
Campbell sound like?

11:18.444 --> 11:19.445
I don't know.

11:21.113 --> 11:22.956
Someone (BLEEP) tell me what
Neve Campbell sounds like.

11:23.015 --> 11:24.619
Just keep it short and get
the hell out of there.

11:24.750 --> 11:26.696
(AUDIENCE APPLAUDING)
Thank you.

11:26.752 --> 11:29.733
<i>Our next guest
has asked me to read this.</i>

11:29.789 --> 11:31.928
Oh, no. Oh, no. I forgot I did this.
Joan.

11:31.991 --> 11:34.335
<i>”Strap on your
adult diapers, everyone,</i>

11:34.393 --> 11:37.806

<i>Give it up for Leslie Knope.</i>

11:44.937 --> 11:46.678

11:47.039 --> 11:48.347

11:48.674 --> 11:49.880

11:53.813 --> 11:56.259
<i>Well, that's my time.
They're giving me the light.</i>

11:56.749 --> 11:58.353
<i>So, uh... [did great.</i>

11:58.417 --> 11:59.862
(SCATTERED APPLAUSE)

<i>MARTIN: Thank you,
Leslie Knope.</i>

12:01.253 --> 12:02.857
<i>You know what they say.
Drama is hard.</i>

12:02.922 --> 12:05.698
<i>And sometimes, comedy is not
in our wheelhouse.</i>

12:05.825 --> 12:07.099
(WHIRRING)

12:07.226 --> 12:09.467
Tom, do you have to
run that right now?

12:09.528 --> 12:12.634
Oh, no, Ben. These smoothies
will just blend themselves.

12:16.035 --> 12:17.241
(BLENDER STOPS)

12:17.303 --> 12:19.305
Okay.
(BLENDER WHIRRING)

12:20.406 --> 12:22.249
I think I have our winner.

12:23.042 --> 12:24.885
It's called
Ru ral Ambu-care.

12:24.944 --> 12:26.924
They want to buy
an ambulance for people

12:26.979 --> 12:28.652
who live far away
from the hospital.

12:28.714 --> 12:31.285
Ambulances are dumb. When has an
ambulance ever helped anyone?

12:31.350 --> 12:32.920
What about
Andy's music thing?

12:32.985 --> 12:35.693
Well, this is a great service that
will help a lot of needy people.

12:35.755 --> 12:36.961
Sorry, Andy.

12:37.022 --> 12:40.868
Why? No, it's totally fine. I'm
happy for them. That's awesome.

12:40.926 --> 12:43.873
You know what I'm going to do? I'm
going to head out to, uh, the car.

12:43.963 --> 12:45.465
Okay. It's a little hot in here.
I'm a little sweaty.

12:45.531 --> 12:47.442
Well, I'm terribly
disappointed,

12:47.500 --> 12:50.481
but I'm sure the doctors,
or giraffes,

12:50.536 --> 12:52.812
or whatever you
decided to help

12:52.872 --> 12:56.649
will be thrilled with the
whatever you decided to whatever.

12:56.709 --> 12:58.450
I'm outtie.
Great job, team.

13:00.079 --> 13:01.251
What?

13:01.313 --> 13:04.351
Ever since Andy failed the police
exam, he's been really depressed.

13:04.416 --> 13:07.522
Picking out a dumb charity is the
most excited he's been in weeks.

13:07.586 --> 13:08.792
You're so selfish.

13:08.854 --> 13:10.925
Selfish?
I'm running a charity.

13:10.990 --> 13:13.163
Oh! It's all about what
you're doing, isn't it?

13:13.692 --> 13:15.638
Classic Ben.
(CLATTERING)

13:15.694 --> 13:17.298
Sorry. Forgot
the oysters.

13:18.063 --> 13:19.667
Great work today.

13:21.901 --> 13:24.313
Christopher.
Chris, Toe, Fur.

13:24.770 --> 13:25.874
It's like you have
furry toes.

13:25.938 --> 13:27.349
Ha! Hilarious.

13:27.406 --> 13:29.545
I have a question
for you.

13:29.608 --> 13:32.817
It's something very important.
Which is...

13:33.913 --> 13:36.018
What is your

13:36.849 --> 13:38.726
spirit animal?
Jaguar. Why do you ask?

13:39.819 --> 13:43.790
Doing a survey. Whelp, survey completed.
So, take her easy.

13:43.856 --> 13:44.926
You didn't ask me.

13:44.990 --> 13:48.096
But if you had, the answer
I would have given is doggy.

13:48.160 --> 13:52.006
Chris, Ann wants to ask you
something right now. Go, Ann.

13:52.064 --> 13:53.168
In front of Perd?

13:53.232 --> 13:55.269
Yes. No more
delays. Go.

13:56.268 --> 13:58.578
(SPEAKING QUICKLY) I want to have a baby.
Will you be the sperm donor?

14:02.441 --> 14:06.116
The story of this situation
is it's extremely personal.

14:07.146 --> 14:08.420
Think it over. Bye.

14:10.783 --> 14:13.855
Leslie, permission to
leave the corner. Denied.

14:13.919 --> 14:15.899
But, look. I did not
lose your speech after all.

14:16.388 --> 14:19.801
I forgot. I put it in my
shoe for safekeeping.

14:20.492 --> 14:22.369
It's a little moist,
but it is still here.

14:22.728 --> 14:24.469
Then, how did Kim
get the speech?

14:25.231 --> 14:26.539
Wait a minute.
The Pawnee Sun

14:26.599 --> 14:28.545
has been one step ahead
of me for months.

14:28.601 --> 14:31.605
They knew that Kernston's withdrew
its sponsorship of the Commons

14:31.670 --> 14:32.944
before I even
announced it.

14:33.005 --> 14:35.781
They asked me about the sewage
eruption in Ramsett Park

14:35.841 --> 14:37.616
right after Ron
e-mailed me about it.

14:37.676 --> 14:41.214
And Kim asked me if I liked the
first season of Army <i>Wives</i>

14:41.580 --> 14:44.060
just moments
after Netflix did.

14:44.516 --> 14:47.725
The Pawnee Sun hacked my e-mail.
I've been hacked!

14:48.587 --> 14:51.193
Okay. Smashing your phone
won't stop hacking.

14:51.257 --> 14:54.500
That's also my phone. Jerry, quiet!
This is serious.

14:56.528 --> 14:58.565
Well, the police said they were
going to launch an investigation

14:58.631 --> 14:59.735
to see whether or
not I was hacked.

14:59.798 --> 15:02.210
But it's very complicated and
it could take up to a month.

15:02.268 --> 15:05.545
There is nothing more disgusting
than an invasion of privacy.

15:05.604 --> 15:08.881
And I should know. I've had many
women steal my undershirts.

15:08.941 --> 15:11.421
I have a press conference about
the Pawnee Commons in two hours.

15:11.477 --> 15:14.356
So, I need to go through every
e-mail that I've ever sent, ever.

15:14.413 --> 15:16.415
I need to know what they
might use against me.

15:16.482 --> 15:19.395
They can't hack into a typewriter.
That's all I have to say.

15:19.451 --> 15:21.431
Can it, Unabomber.
This is an emergency.

15:22.688 --> 15:24.292
Hey, Ben.
Hi.

15:24.356 --> 15:25.596
You wanted to talk to me?

15:25.658 --> 15:28.502
Or probably not. I mean, I
don't even want to talk to me.

15:28.560 --> 15:30.335
No, I wanted to talk to you. Oh.

15:30.396 --> 15:32.774
Just wanted to thank you so
much for your help, Andy.

15:32.831 --> 15:35.471
Sorry we didn't wind up choosing
the after-school music program.

15:35.534 --> 15:36.774
It's just...
I totally get it.

15:36.835 --> 15:38.337
The music program
would be effective,

15:38.404 --> 15:42.443
but the ambulance is going to help
people right now who are in trouble.

15:42.508 --> 15:43.987
And it would probably
look good in the media.

15:44.543 --> 15:47.387
Yeah. That's
exactly right.

15:47.446 --> 15:48.857
Your morning tea,
Mr. Wyatt?

15:48.914 --> 15:50.154
Imagine all the money
you could save

15:50.215 --> 15:51.956
if you didn't have to pay
for this expensive stuff.

15:52.017 --> 15:54.258
(LAUGHS) Am I right? You could help,
like, a zillion more charities.

15:54.320 --> 15:57.733
Yeah, that's also
exactly right.

15:57.790 --> 15:59.565
I feel like I should
have thought of that.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.696
Let me tell you something
else that's interesting, Ben.

16:01.760 --> 16:02.932
What?

16:02.995 --> 16:05.134
I farted five minutes ago.

16:06.031 --> 16:07.271
I didn't even smell
it until just now.

16:07.933 --> 16:09.378
That's how tight
my pants are.

16:09.435 --> 16:12.473
Anyhow.
Later days, dudes.

16:15.674 --> 16:17.517
Okay. Nothing
too bad, so far.

16:17.576 --> 16:21.046
There's a "Top Ten Ben's
Butts 2012" slideshow.

16:21.113 --> 16:25.061
<i>You e-mailed it to Ben. And Ann.
And the Huffington Post?</i>

16:25.117 --> 16:26.357
Yeah, I'm not
embarrassed by that.

16:26.418 --> 16:28.056
Who is Todo Toadfoot?

16:28.120 --> 16:32.159
You wrote him an e-mail about riding
your dragons to Pelennor Fields

16:32.224 --> 16:34.636
and signed it "Dimple
Broadbelt of Buckland."

16:34.727 --> 16:37.731
Yes, that's Ben in my fantasy Lord
of the <i>Rings</i> pen pal letters.

16:37.796 --> 16:39.173
I am a little
embarrassed by that.

16:39.231 --> 16:42.178
Here's one to me.
And it just says "Thanks".

16:42.234 --> 16:43.542
You're welcome.
(CELL PHONE VIBRATING)

16:43.602 --> 16:45.172
Oh, great.
I got a new e-mail

16:45.237 --> 16:46.841
about the parking lot
at the Pawnee Commons.

16:46.905 --> 16:48.851
I keep getting
e-mails all the time.

16:48.907 --> 16:50.978
I have to do well at this
press conference. Donna...

16:51.043 --> 16:52.750
Listen, freaky.

16:52.811 --> 16:54.552
Every single one
of my boyfriends

16:54.613 --> 16:56.320
has tried to
hack into my e-mail.

16:56.382 --> 16:58.726
I got an idea.
Everybody out.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.060
Sorry. Oh.

17:04.123 --> 17:06.501
Ann Perkins, I see you behind
that attractive purse.

17:06.592 --> 17:08.435
You haven't returned
any of my calls.

17:08.794 --> 17:11.569
Yeah. That's because,
uh, I'm mortified.

17:12.397 --> 17:15.641
I'm so sorry that I was
so weird and blunt.

17:15.701 --> 17:17.578
I am touched
and honored

17:17.636 --> 17:20.445
that you would even consider me
to be the father of your child.

17:20.506 --> 17:22.508
And I'm glad that you came
right out and said it.

17:22.574 --> 17:24.076
I mean, if we're
really considering this,

17:24.143 --> 17:26.589
then we have to start at a
place of complete honesty.

17:27.746 --> 17:30.317
You're right.
And I'll start now.

17:30.382 --> 17:34.194
You are a great specimen.

17:34.253 --> 17:35.994
That's a terrible
choice of words.

17:36.555 --> 17:40.332
If my baby turned out
to be anything like you,

17:41.260 --> 17:42.398
I'd be lucky.

17:44.763 --> 17:46.902
Can I have just a little bit
of time to think about it?

17:46.965 --> 17:49.468
Of course. Yes. Take as
much time as you want.

17:49.535 --> 17:52.243
Or maybe just, like, a couple of
days because I'm getting antsy.

17:52.337 --> 17:55.216
And I'm ovulating
on Thursday. So, chop-chop.

17:55.741 --> 17:56.742
But take your time.

17:58.744 --> 17:59.814
Wear loose pants!

18:04.383 --> 18:08.957
I've got to tell you, Ron. You
were absolutely and totally right.

18:09.021 --> 18:11.331
I know. Stop talking and get out.
Yep.

18:14.159 --> 18:17.003
The redneck ambulance
is a great choice.

18:17.062 --> 18:20.874
We can release a publicity
shot of a buck-toothed hayseed

18:20.933 --> 18:23.470
taking medicine for the
first time in his life.

18:23.535 --> 18:25.640
We can figure out
the photo later.

18:26.071 --> 18:29.280
Oh, I forgot. It's Fondue Friday.
Yay!

18:29.341 --> 18:32.720
Yeah, also, as President of the
Foundation, I'm making a few changes.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.951
I'm giving up this office.

18:35.013 --> 18:38.358
And no more visits from a
masseuse or fancy lunches.

18:38.417 --> 18:40.226
It's way out of hand.

18:40.285 --> 18:44.062
Sweetie, all the money we spend on
the Foundation is tax deductible.

18:44.123 --> 18:46.729
I know, and it's
a huge waste of money.

18:46.792 --> 18:49.102
I mean, there's plenty
of cheap office space around.

18:49.161 --> 18:52.608
And I have an idea for how to use
some of the money we'll save.

18:52.664 --> 18:55.338
(LAUGHS) Get yourself
a matching nude portrait?

18:55.801 --> 18:57.508
I can call the painter.
Please don't.

18:58.637 --> 19:00.947
First, I'd like you all
to check under your chairs.

19:01.006 --> 19:03.850
I think you might be surprised
and excited by what you find.

19:04.610 --> 19:06.817
Is it chocolate?
Even better. It's dirt.

19:06.879 --> 19:09.621
The EPA has recently reviewed
our soil samples,

19:09.681 --> 19:12.423
and they determined that
we achieved, and I quote,

19:12.484 --> 19:14.794
"Minimal
acceptable standards."

19:14.853 --> 19:17.129
So, not too shabby.

19:17.189 --> 19:21.331
Uh, Councilwoman Knope, you've claimed
construction will take 18 months,

19:21.393 --> 19:23.532
but a source tells me
it will be much longer.

19:23.595 --> 19:25.905
I would deny that report.

19:25.964 --> 19:30.811
I've also learned that the EPA
found midi-chlorians in the soil?

19:30.869 --> 19:32.507
How serious is that,
exactly?

19:32.804 --> 19:34.283
It's very serious, Kim.

19:34.339 --> 19:36.649
It's almost as serious
as e-mail hacking,

19:37.209 --> 19:40.088
which is what you have
been doing to me for weeks.

19:40.479 --> 19:41.549
(GASPS)

19:43.582 --> 19:45.391
I really thought
you guys would gasp there.

19:45.484 --> 19:47.623
That is a baseless accusation.

19:47.686 --> 19:50.030
Midi-chlorians are
a fictional substance

19:50.088 --> 19:52.694
found in the blood
of Jedi Knights

19:52.758 --> 19:56.262
<i>from the movie Star Wars:
Episode I, The Phantom Menace.</i>

19:56.328 --> 19:57.739
Which, side note,
was a terrible movie

19:57.796 --> 20:00.037
and almost destroyed the franchise,
according to my husband.

20:00.098 --> 20:01.270
But that is
neither here nor there.

20:01.333 --> 20:04.610
The point is, I sent Councilwoman
Knope the fake e-mail

20:04.670 --> 20:07.742
about the EPA finding
midi-chlorians an hour ago.

20:07.806 --> 20:08.841
As a trap.

20:08.907 --> 20:10.045
Into which
you have fallen.

20:10.209 --> 20:11.483
Well,

20:11.944 --> 20:13.446
I have never seen
Star <i>Wars.</i>

20:13.512 --> 20:18.359
Because I was too busy hooking
up with guys, unlike you losers.

20:18.417 --> 20:20.863
(LAUGHS) Oh, you want to
compare numbers, Terlando?

20:20.919 --> 20:22.364
Get to stepping.

20:22.421 --> 20:23.525
LESLIE: I would just like
to point out

20:23.589 --> 20:25.830
that Kim Terlando
stole all of my jokes

20:25.891 --> 20:27.165
for the Pawnee
Correspondents' Lunch.

20:27.226 --> 20:28.466
And they were great jokes.

20:28.527 --> 20:31.940
So I spent the whole night writing new ones.
Lucky for you.

20:31.997 --> 20:33.908
Let's get started.

20:33.966 --> 20:36.537
I've very excited to be here. You
know who else is excited to be here?

20:36.602 --> 20:37.910
Neve Campbell.

20:37.970 --> 20:39.677
What a great party.

20:39.738 --> 20:42.116
Of five.
All right. Thank you, guys.

20:43.942 --> 20:46.786
The point is, I could use someone
to help me at the Foundation

20:46.845 --> 20:50.156
as a part-time assistant,
but also an idea man.

20:50.215 --> 20:54.925
Might I suggest Tom? He loves ideas.
Also, a man.

20:54.987 --> 20:58.366
Well, no, Andy, I've
already chosen the person,

20:58.423 --> 21:00.300
and it is not Tom.

21:02.561 --> 21:03.733
Then, who is it?

21:04.730 --> 21:07.768
Well, he is, uh, sitting
right here in this courtyard.

21:11.136 --> 21:12.137
That guy?

21:12.771 --> 21:15.183
Do you even know him? Oh, my God.
Andy, it's you.

21:15.240 --> 21:18.346
I think you may have a knack
for charitable giving.

21:18.410 --> 21:19.650
Will you come work for me?

21:20.545 --> 21:22.525
Uh-oh.
What's happening?

21:24.049 --> 21:25.084
Oh!

21:26.305 --> 21:32.201
