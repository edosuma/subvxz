Edgar Leeman, where have you been?

01:13.069 --> 01:16.738
I have been to England to visit the Queen.

01:16.806 --> 01:19.440
You left 2 hours ago to buy soup bones!

01:19.509 --> 01:22.243
Why have soup...

01:22.311 --> 01:25.680
when you can have this... chicken!

01:25.748 --> 01:27.782
- We can't afford chicken.
- Ah.

01:27.850 --> 01:30.952
And then...

01:31.020 --> 01:32.953
there's this...

01:33.021 --> 01:36.323
Edgar, what in heaven!

01:36.391 --> 01:38.893
I bought it at a thrift store. 50 cents.

01:38.960 --> 01:41.228
But it looks brand new!

01:41.295 --> 01:44.064
Happy anniversary, dear.

01:44.132 --> 01:46.033
You haven't been gambling, have you?

01:46.100 --> 01:48.868
You swear on your mother's grave?

01:48.936 --> 01:50.870
On my mother's grave

01:50.938 --> 01:52.805
and a stack of Bibles up to my chin,

01:52.873 --> 01:56.509
I swear, these were not
bought with winnings.

01:56.577 --> 01:59.579
Oh, Edgar!

01:59.647 --> 02:01.948
I'll get it.

02:02.016 --> 02:04.950
Can I help you?

02:05.018 --> 02:06.952
I'm sorry, no!

02:07.020 --> 02:08.954
Edgar, who is it?

02:09.021 --> 02:11.523
Edgar!

02:11.591 --> 02:15.027
Oh, God! Edgar! Oh, Edgar!

02:35.713 --> 02:38.347
Mrs. Leeman?

02:40.317 --> 02:43.954
He left the house to buy bones.

02:44.121 --> 02:46.756
We had a dollar and 4 cents
to last us through the week,

02:46.824 --> 02:48.925
so we were making do with soup.

02:48.993 --> 02:50.827
And yet he came home with chicken

02:50.895 --> 02:52.895
and a fancy hat.

02:52.962 --> 02:56.198
He always had a keen eye for a bargain.

02:56.265 --> 02:59.367
Well then, perhaps you can
tell me how it is your husband

02:59.435 --> 03:02.671
came home with more money
than he had when he left?

03:10.377 --> 03:12.611
This way.

03:12.679 --> 03:14.546
"I'm sorry, no."

03:14.614 --> 03:17.416
- Those were his last words?
- According to his wife. Yes.

03:17.484 --> 03:20.452
That's what I say to all those
bloody door-to-door salesmen.

03:20.520 --> 03:23.388
Maybe one of them just cracked. A
man can only take so much rejection.

03:23.455 --> 03:25.590
Sir, I think it has more
to do with the money.

03:25.657 --> 03:28.559
After all, he did come home with
more money than he had when he left.

03:28.627 --> 03:31.228
- Perhaps he was a gambler.
- He assured his wife he wasn't.

03:31.296 --> 03:33.631
Ha! Ha! Ha! I assure the wife

03:33.699 --> 03:35.700
that the bottle in my desk is
the same one I was working on

03:35.768 --> 03:37.834
last week. Men lie, Murdoch.

03:37.902 --> 03:39.836
You may not, but the rest of us bloody do.

03:39.904 --> 03:42.706
Yes, I'm aware of that,
sir. But if he was gambling,

03:42.774 --> 03:46.142
why call attention to it by
buying his wife an elaborate gift?

03:46.210 --> 03:48.879
Well, if he had more money,
someone else had less,

03:48.946 --> 03:51.615
and maybe that someone
was unhappy about it.

03:51.682 --> 03:55.083
Right then, any new insights
into the pastor Henshaw murder?

03:55.151 --> 03:57.052
I'm afraid not, sir,

03:57.120 --> 03:59.054
although I believe I've
identified the murder weapon.

03:59.088 --> 04:01.123
According to the bruising, it's consistent

04:01.190 --> 04:04.827
with the pastor being
beaten to death with a cane.

04:04.895 --> 04:06.762
- Any finger marks on it?
- Only the pastor's.

04:06.830 --> 04:10.331
- And there's also this blood smear.
- Is that it?

04:10.399 --> 04:12.901
- I'm afraid so.
- Well, Murdoch,

04:12.968 --> 04:14.869
I think I'll take a crack at this one.

04:14.937 --> 04:17.439
Maybe there's something that the
old Thomas S. Brackenreid nose

04:17.505 --> 04:19.474
- can sniff out.
- Hmm, have at it, sir.

04:21.577 --> 04:24.045
- Gentlemen.
- Good morning, Doctor.

04:24.112 --> 04:26.246
You're having a busy week.
First, the pastor Henshaw murder

04:26.314 --> 04:28.248
and now another one.

04:28.316 --> 04:30.350
Yes, I've asked the doctor for any insights

04:30.418 --> 04:33.719
she may have into what possibly
motivated the pastor's killer.

04:33.787 --> 04:36.823
I'm afraid I don't have any
insights that aren't obvious.

04:36.890 --> 04:39.258
Given the amount of bruising on his face,

04:39.326 --> 04:42.595
it's apparent he was struck
repeatedly even after he collapsed.

04:42.663 --> 04:45.898
- So he was killed in anger.
- That would be my analysis.

04:45.966 --> 04:47.867
Well, you're right, that is bloody obvious.

04:47.935 --> 04:49.868
But who would be so enraged

04:49.936 --> 04:52.236
as to kill a pastor?

04:52.304 --> 04:55.139
Cause of death, a bullet
wound through the left aorta.

04:55.207 --> 04:57.542
Death would have occurred
within seconds, I should think.

04:57.610 --> 05:01.045
- Did you retrieve the bullet?
- Yes! .41 calibre.

05:01.113 --> 05:03.247
- A Derringer.
- The gambler's choice,

05:03.315 --> 05:05.383
- I believe.
- May I take this?

05:05.451 --> 05:07.417
We already know the calibre

05:07.486 --> 05:09.419
and the make of gun, what
more is there to discern?

05:09.488 --> 05:13.156
Every gun barrel has rifling

05:13.224 --> 05:15.626
which leaves striations on every bullet.

05:15.694 --> 05:21.264
These striations are as
distinctive as finger marks.

05:21.332 --> 05:24.100
Oh yes, I see, how interesting!

05:29.239 --> 05:32.041
I beg your pardon.

05:32.109 --> 05:34.611
Thank you.

05:34.678 --> 05:37.980
Crabtree, have a look at the
picture. Move your left arm.

05:38.047 --> 05:41.383
- Yes, that! That's it!
- But, sir, I'm trying!

05:41.450 --> 05:43.418
What's all this?

05:43.486 --> 05:46.087
Ah, Murdoch. Just working on a theory.

05:46.155 --> 05:49.324
I don't believe that this
was the murder weapon.

05:49.392 --> 05:52.661
But I thought the pastor's bruising was
consistent with the shape of this cane.

05:52.729 --> 05:56.497
Watch this. The victim was hit 8 times.

05:56.565 --> 05:59.099
One, two, three, four, five, six,

05:59.167 --> 06:00.968
seven, eight!

06:04.840 --> 06:08.609
And yet there is only blood on
the middle portion of the cane.

06:08.677 --> 06:12.345
I think that the cane
belonged to the pastor,

06:12.413 --> 06:14.648
who used it to try to defend
himself, but the killer

06:14.715 --> 06:17.918
Drove it, drove it into his face!

06:17.985 --> 06:20.053
Very good, sir.

06:20.120 --> 06:22.622
You're welcome, Murdoch.

06:22.690 --> 06:25.358
Right, up you get, George.

06:25.426 --> 06:27.526
Any progress on the hat?

06:27.594 --> 06:29.461
Sir, we've checked with every thrift store

06:29.529 --> 06:31.564
this side of Yonge Street.
None of them have sold

06:31.631 --> 06:34.667
an Italian straw hat with ostrich
plumage and champagne ribboning.

06:34.734 --> 06:37.169
That's a very detailed description, George.

06:37.236 --> 06:39.137
Oh, sir, my aunt Primrose
used to send me to fetch hats

06:39.205 --> 06:41.073
all the time. One had to be very specific,

06:41.140 --> 06:43.942
there was a great many hats.

06:44.009 --> 06:45.910
Right, uh, George,

06:45.978 --> 06:48.780
perhaps Mr. Leeman lied about
where he obtained the hat

06:48.847 --> 06:51.883
to conceal from his wife that
he had suddenly come into money.

06:51.951 --> 06:54.686
- Check all the other hat shops.
- Sir, we have,

06:54.753 --> 06:57.055
and there is one store
that sells that exact hat,

06:57.122 --> 06:59.656
with the ribboning also
available in plum and raspberry.

06:59.724 --> 07:01.357
Where is this?

07:01.425 --> 07:03.259
On the corner of Carlton and Parliament.

07:03.327 --> 07:05.996
I believe this to be a reasonable exchange.

07:06.064 --> 07:08.899
Let me tell you what hell is like.

07:08.967 --> 07:11.234
Imagine placing your hand

07:11.302 --> 07:14.003
over a candle at the tip of the flame.

07:14.071 --> 07:17.006
After a second, the pain
is already unbearable

07:17.074 --> 07:19.341
I don't care! I don't care!
I'm the one who's talking!

07:19.409 --> 07:23.245
That's right! She's the one.
She's the one. She's the one.

07:23.313 --> 07:25.280
She begged me. She begged me.

07:25.348 --> 07:28.150
- Come on in.
- You're going to love it.

07:28.218 --> 07:30.919
Honestly. Thank you so much. Ok, bye-bye.

07:33.055 --> 07:35.123
- Keep walking, Grimsby.
- As ugly as ever.

07:35.190 --> 07:37.525
Thank you. If you need some
rope to hang yourself...

07:37.593 --> 07:39.761
Fresh pizza pie!

07:39.829 --> 07:44.499
Pizza pie! Fresh pizza pie!

07:44.566 --> 07:46.667
Beautiful day today! Come
on in and get your meat!

07:46.735 --> 07:48.836
All right, George. Show
this photograph around

07:48.903 --> 07:51.538
and see if anyone recalls seeing
Mr. Leeman yesterday afternoon.

07:51.606 --> 07:53.907
- Sir.
- Pizza pie, don't be shy!

07:53.975 --> 07:56.243
Come on over, everybody!

07:56.310 --> 07:59.146
- Pizza pie! Fresh pizza pie!
- Sale over here, ladies and gentlemen!

07:59.213 --> 08:02.181
Come on in for some
specials on our meats today!

08:05.819 --> 08:09.088
Oh yes. I remember him.

08:09.156 --> 08:11.991
He came in to buy a hat for his wife.

08:12.059 --> 08:15.762
- What time was this?
- Just after closing, around 6.

08:15.829 --> 08:18.429
We weren't going to let him in,
but he was in such good spirits,

08:18.497 --> 08:21.867
we couldn't say no. Came in singing,

08:21.934 --> 08:25.336
kissed our hands, even
tried some of the hats.

08:25.404 --> 08:28.140
How much was the hat that he bought?

08:28.207 --> 08:30.676
4 dollars and 15 cents.

08:30.743 --> 08:33.178
- It was our most expensive hat.
- Hmm.

08:33.245 --> 08:36.380
Paid using a brand new 10-dollar bill.

08:36.447 --> 08:38.916
You don't see many of those.

08:38.984 --> 08:41.652
- Best price here.
- I don't care.

08:41.720 --> 08:45.156
I don't care. I don't care. I don't care.
She wanted me to, but I don't care...

08:45.223 --> 08:47.091
The devil tempts you all the time.

08:47.159 --> 08:50.894
She wanted me to. I don't care, don't care.

08:50.961 --> 08:53.063
Excuse me, sir.

08:53.130 --> 08:55.932
She wanted, wanted me
to go ahead and do it.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.967
Sir, did you see this
man yesterday afternoon?

08:58.035 --> 08:59.936
He's dead.

09:00.004 --> 09:01.938
Yes, but did you see
him yesterday afternoon?

09:02.006 --> 09:05.675
It wasn't my blood on him. Him. He knows.

09:05.742 --> 09:07.676
He knows what?

09:07.744 --> 09:10.645
Ooh, he's one of them. And then, then, then

09:10.714 --> 09:13.648
she just told me to do
it, she wanted me to do it.

09:13.717 --> 09:15.517
I just didn't want to, I didn't want to...

09:15.585 --> 09:18.787
Pizza pie! Fresh pizza pie!

09:18.855 --> 09:20.856
Excuse me, sir.

09:20.924 --> 09:22.824
Did you see this man yesterday afternoon?

09:22.891 --> 09:26.160
Hmm, sorry. Pizza pie! Fresh pizza pie!

09:26.229 --> 09:28.930
This chap seems to think that you did.

09:28.997 --> 09:31.233
That man's a bloody lunatic!

09:33.202 --> 09:35.803
Ah, who knows? Maybe I did see him.

09:35.871 --> 09:38.005
But if he didn't buy a bite,
I'm not going to remember, eh?

09:38.073 --> 09:39.973
What is this pizza pie?

09:40.041 --> 09:42.075
It's a tomato and cheese pie.

09:42.143 --> 09:44.010
If you want meat, you have
to wait for the next one, eh?

09:44.078 --> 09:47.715
- Well, a penny a bite, eh?
- Well, there you go.

09:49.884 --> 09:52.986
Trust no one but your Lord...

09:53.054 --> 09:55.555
- It's delicious!
- Yeah!

09:55.623 --> 09:58.190
- That's very good!
- Yeah! Pizza pie!

09:58.259 --> 10:00.860
Fresh pizza pie! Anything, George?

10:00.927 --> 10:03.296
Ah, sir. Nothing yet, I'm afraid.

10:03.364 --> 10:06.532
- Constable Crabtree!
- Mrs. Lynd, it's good to see you.

10:06.600 --> 10:09.235
- You still have your purse, I see.
- Yes, thanks to you.

10:09.303 --> 10:13.004
Two weeks ago I left it
on this bench right here

10:13.072 --> 10:15.674
and when I came back it was gone!

10:15.742 --> 10:17.876
Along with the only
photograph of my dear Jack.

10:17.943 --> 10:20.011
Higgins and I did a search of the alleys.

10:20.079 --> 10:22.381
Yes, and you found it!

10:22.448 --> 10:24.883
You know, someone just took what
they wanted and tossed it away.

10:24.950 --> 10:26.917
I mean, can you believe that?

10:26.985 --> 10:30.488
I was just so grateful I
brought a pie to his house.

10:30.555 --> 10:32.623
Yes, you did. It was excellent as well.

10:32.691 --> 10:35.526
Mrs. Lynd, did you see this
man yesterday afternoon?

10:35.594 --> 10:37.461
Oh...

10:37.529 --> 10:41.031
Yes... yes, a nice man.

10:41.099 --> 10:44.467
He tipped his hat to me.
People don't do that anymore.

10:44.535 --> 10:46.736
In my days, everybody greeted
with a little tip of the hat...

10:46.805 --> 10:49.673
Mrs. Lynd, hm, did you
see where the man went?

10:49.740 --> 10:52.642
Why, yes. Of course.

10:52.710 --> 10:55.645
People think I'm half-daft,
but I remember everything.

10:57.849 --> 11:00.416
Yeah, he was here. Came in with 4 cents

11:00.483 --> 11:03.820
wanting to buy soup bones,
like I'm some kind of charity.

11:03.887 --> 11:06.222
- Charity?
- Hey, you want soup bones

11:06.290 --> 11:09.158
for less than a nickel,
find 'em somewhere else.

11:09.226 --> 11:11.127
But he bought a chicken
from you, did he not?

11:11.195 --> 11:13.696
Yeah, that was later.

11:13.763 --> 11:15.997
Comes in smiling like he's my best friend,

11:16.065 --> 11:17.999
puts down two bits and buys a chicken.

11:18.067 --> 11:20.768
Didn't you find that strange?

11:20.837 --> 11:22.704
No, I call that business.

11:22.771 --> 11:25.473
You give me two bits, I give you a chicken.

11:25.541 --> 11:28.877
That's about market
price for a chicken, sir.

11:28.945 --> 11:31.345
Sir, do you know of anywhere near here

11:31.412 --> 11:33.413
where a man might be able to gamble?

11:33.481 --> 11:37.084
Right next door. Name's Robert Grimsby.

11:37.152 --> 11:41.288
Runs the tailor shop, but
he's really a 2-bit bookie.

11:41.356 --> 11:44.725
Never seen him before.

11:44.792 --> 11:47.493
So he wasn't here yesterday afternoon?

11:47.561 --> 11:50.330
If he was, I would have seen him.

11:50.397 --> 11:52.832
That's odd...

11:52.900 --> 11:55.835
because we believe this
man won some money gambling,

11:55.903 --> 11:58.104
and the word on the street is that your...

11:58.172 --> 12:00.874
business doubles as a betting shop.

12:00.941 --> 12:03.208
Who told you that? Oh, wait, let me guess.

12:03.276 --> 12:06.078
Runs a butcher shop next door?

12:06.145 --> 12:08.881
Do yourself a favour and don't
listen to anything he says.

12:08.948 --> 12:10.883
Why would he lie?

12:10.950 --> 12:13.886
- He owes me money.
- Oh!

12:13.953 --> 12:15.854
Well, I suppose that
explains whey he told me

12:15.922 --> 12:17.822
you were running a betting shop.

12:17.891 --> 12:20.992
It's in your best interests
to let us take a look around.

12:21.059 --> 12:23.227
Well, Detective, I can assure you

12:23.295 --> 12:26.197
that there is absolutely nothing
out of the ordinary for you

12:26.265 --> 12:29.767
to find here. Sir?

12:29.834 --> 12:33.437
Here's a book with some
interesting-looking measurements.

12:35.439 --> 12:37.840
Why, yes! Oh!

12:37.909 --> 12:39.776
And here is an E. Leeman

12:39.843 --> 12:43.146
right here. That's odd.
You say you don't know him,

12:43.214 --> 12:45.515
but his name is right here.

12:45.582 --> 12:47.517
All right, I knew him.

12:47.584 --> 12:49.619
He was here yesterday. He put one dollar

12:49.686 --> 12:52.087
on Wishbone to win. Said
he had been given a tip.

12:52.155 --> 12:54.290
- And he won?
- No, he lost.

12:54.357 --> 12:58.260
- Wishbone came in third.
- Sir.

13:08.304 --> 13:10.238
He lost?

13:10.306 --> 13:12.941
- Where did he get the money then?
- I don't know, sir.

13:15.610 --> 13:18.679
Is it the one that killed Leeman?

13:18.747 --> 13:22.850
- Doesn't appear to be.
- Bloody hell.

13:22.918 --> 13:26.019
Sirs, there's been another
murder. Mrs. Thelma Greene.

13:28.656 --> 13:31.591
The victim died from
a gunshot to the heart.

13:31.659 --> 13:33.994
Right ventricle this time.

13:34.062 --> 13:37.530
I found some powder residue on her dress.

13:37.598 --> 13:39.465
She was shot at close range, then.

13:39.532 --> 13:41.834
Indeed, I extracted this.

13:41.901 --> 13:44.337
From a Derringer I expect.

13:44.404 --> 13:46.472
Perhaps the same one
that killed Edgar Leeman.

13:46.539 --> 13:48.507
Would you like to confirm it yourself?

13:48.575 --> 13:50.576
May I?

13:56.882 --> 13:58.950
They're a match.

14:01.066 --> 14:04.268
- Same gun, same killer.
- Two very different victims.

14:04.335 --> 14:06.303
Edgar Leeman was a coalman,

14:06.371 --> 14:08.872
a bon vivant, drinker, gambler.

14:08.939 --> 14:12.075
While Thelma Greene was thick as
thieves with the Temperance League.

14:12.143 --> 14:14.444
They both lived in different worlds,

14:14.512 --> 14:17.013
professionally, socially,
and geographically.

14:17.081 --> 14:19.782
- So what's the connection?
- It's yet to be determined.

14:19.849 --> 14:22.585
Any chance the pastor's
murder could be related?

14:22.653 --> 14:25.120
Not likely, I think.

14:25.189 --> 14:27.190
The pastor was beaten,
the other 2 were shot.

14:29.125 --> 14:31.060
Yes, but all 3 victims
were found murdered inside

14:31.127 --> 14:33.196
their own front doors. There
could be something to that.

14:34.998 --> 14:37.131
Higgins!

14:37.200 --> 14:39.133
George, what have you?

14:39.202 --> 14:41.469
Sir, according to household staff,

14:41.537 --> 14:43.505
Mrs. Greene left her home on Jarvis Street

14:43.573 --> 14:45.473
yesterday afternoon to attend a...

14:45.541 --> 14:47.475
- Sir, your mail.
- ... Temperance League luncheon

14:47.543 --> 14:50.144
- at Broadview and Gerrard.
- Right. We'll need to find out

14:50.213 --> 14:52.713
if any of the luncheon guests
had a connection to Leeman.

14:52.780 --> 14:54.748
Sir, if I may, I believe
I have already found

14:54.816 --> 14:58.219
a connection between the
victims. It lies in their names.

14:58.286 --> 15:01.555
- Their names?
- Yes, sir. I had time to ponder this on the streetcar.

15:01.623 --> 15:04.592
As you know, sir, I enjoy a good word game.

15:04.659 --> 15:07.227
Actually, no, George, I didn't know.

15:07.294 --> 15:09.061
Well I do, and I found, sir,

15:09.129 --> 15:11.097
that if you eliminate the common letters

15:11.164 --> 15:14.033
in both of the victim's
names, you are left with

15:14.101 --> 15:17.203
D-E-A-T-H.

15:17.271 --> 15:19.305
Death!

15:21.775 --> 15:24.043
Surely, sir, you don't
think that's a coincidence?

15:24.111 --> 15:26.511
George, do we know when

15:26.579 --> 15:28.547
Mrs. Greene left the luncheon?

15:28.615 --> 15:30.616
2:45 or thereabouts.

15:30.683 --> 15:32.417
Do we have any idea where she went?

15:32.485 --> 15:34.419
According to witnesses at
the luncheon, she grew tired

15:34.487 --> 15:36.355
of waiting for a hansom
cab and walked home.

15:36.422 --> 15:39.191
Walked home. Right.

15:39.259 --> 15:41.760
If I'm not mistaken,
George, the shortest distance

15:41.827 --> 15:43.995
between the luncheon and Mrs. Greene's home

15:44.063 --> 15:46.164
is through Carlton and Parliament.

15:46.232 --> 15:49.000
- The lion's den.
- All right, Higgins,

15:49.068 --> 15:51.502
you take this side of the
street and I'll take this one.

15:51.570 --> 15:54.239
Well, why do you get
this side of the street?

15:54.306 --> 15:56.406
- Well, what's the difference?
- It shall come to pass

15:56.474 --> 16:00.210
to all who are not written
in the Lamb's book of life...

16:00.278 --> 16:02.913
It's these fire and brimstone
types, George, they...

16:02.981 --> 16:06.183
- It makes me uncomfortable.
- Well, I'll gladly switch with you Henry,

16:06.251 --> 16:08.485
but I've got a demented beggar on my side

16:08.552 --> 16:11.255
who talks night and
day to Heaven-knows-who.

16:11.322 --> 16:13.322
So, it's your choice.

16:15.225 --> 16:17.693
- Fine.
- Pizza pie!

16:17.761 --> 16:20.229
- The family's gonna love it!
- Got fresh meatloaf!

16:20.297 --> 16:23.065
- Mrs. Lynd!
- Hello, Constable.

16:23.133 --> 16:26.002
- How are you?
- I'm very well, come have a seat.

16:26.069 --> 16:28.036
- Piece of cake?
- No, I mustn't.

16:28.104 --> 16:30.738
I'll pop the buttons off my tunic.

16:30.807 --> 16:33.141
Mrs. Lynd, I'm afraid
there's been another murder.

16:33.209 --> 16:36.544
- Oh no!
- Do you remember seeing this woman?

16:36.612 --> 16:39.981
Pizza pie! Everybody, come
and get the best pizza in town!

16:40.049 --> 16:41.917
- Was she wearing a pink dress?
- Yes.

16:41.984 --> 16:44.585
I would have called it more
a coral tone, but that's her.

16:44.653 --> 16:46.587
I miss wearing colour.

16:46.655 --> 16:48.790
Ever since my dear Jack died,

16:48.857 --> 16:51.426
I only wear black. It's only right.

16:51.493 --> 16:54.128
Do you remember where she went?

16:54.196 --> 16:56.798
Oh yes. She went into the hat shop.

16:56.865 --> 16:58.433
Oh, I know her all right.

16:58.500 --> 17:00.500
Wish I didn't.

17:00.568 --> 17:03.036
- Why is that?
- She comes in all the time,

17:03.103 --> 17:05.439
treats everyone like a servant,

17:05.506 --> 17:07.173
tries on all the hats one by one.

17:07.241 --> 17:09.142
And if she ever does buy, she tries

17:09.210 --> 17:11.345
to haggle with the price,
like she can't afford it.

17:11.412 --> 17:14.714
It's my observation that rich
people are often the stingiest.

17:14.781 --> 17:17.717
Which I suppose has something to do with
how they became rich in the first place.

17:17.784 --> 17:21.185
- What happened to her?
- She was murdered.

17:21.253 --> 17:23.489
Oh, my Lord!

17:23.557 --> 17:26.459
She didn't deserve that, no
matter how miserly she was.

17:26.526 --> 17:28.661
Does it strike you as
strange, Mrs. Palmerston,

17:28.729 --> 17:31.664
that both victims passed through your
store shortly before their deaths?

17:31.732 --> 17:35.099
Are you suggesting I had
something to do with this?

17:35.167 --> 17:37.669
It's routine questioning, ma'am.

17:37.737 --> 17:39.871
I hardly think I'd still be in business

17:39.938 --> 17:42.674
if I were in the habit of
killing off my customers.

17:42.742 --> 17:46.210
Yes, of course. Thank you.

17:48.013 --> 17:53.216
Revelations 21 verse 8 makes it clear.

17:53.284 --> 17:56.587
"The fearful, and unbelieving,

17:56.654 --> 17:58.722
and the abominable, and murderers...

17:58.790 --> 18:01.091
- Sir...
- "And fornicators,

18:01.158 --> 18:03.927
and sorcerers, and idolaters,

18:03.995 --> 18:06.061
- and all liars..."
- Sir!

18:06.129 --> 18:08.964
"Shall find their part in the
lake which burneth with fire!"

18:09.032 --> 18:10.800
If you don't pay attention
to what I'm showing you,

18:10.868 --> 18:13.936
you'll be preaching atop a jailhouse bunk.

18:15.939 --> 18:19.074
Never seen her before.

18:19.142 --> 18:21.443
This is the second death,

18:21.511 --> 18:23.478
which shall come to pass

18:23.546 --> 18:25.480
- to all who are not written...
- George?

18:25.548 --> 18:27.516
I've just spoken to the
pizza Man. He says...

18:27.583 --> 18:29.684
- Did you have a bite?
- No, I didn't have a bite.

18:29.752 --> 18:31.686
I don't want a bite of something
someone else has chewed on.

18:31.754 --> 18:34.155
Oh, honestly, Henry, you're
so particular sometimes.

18:34.223 --> 18:36.190
Anyways. He remembers her.

18:36.258 --> 18:38.459
- Really? From where?
- He saw her outside

18:38.527 --> 18:41.562
the Bank of Toronto counting
money. The Bank of Toronto?

18:41.630 --> 18:43.531
- That's what he said, sir.
- What is it?

18:43.732 --> 18:46.534
Well, I was going through
pastor Henshaw's finances,

18:46.601 --> 18:48.702
and he does his banking
at the Carlton branch

18:48.770 --> 18:50.671
of the Bank of Toronto.

18:50.739 --> 18:52.672
Look at the final transaction.

18:52.740 --> 18:54.373
"May 11th."

18:54.442 --> 18:58.445
The day he was killed. That
connects my murder to your 2.

18:58.512 --> 19:00.847
It could be just a coincidence.

19:00.915 --> 19:02.782
Or it could be good news.

19:02.850 --> 19:04.818
You said so yourself,
Murdoch, all 3 victims passed

19:04.885 --> 19:06.786
through this neighbourhood
the day they were killed.

19:06.854 --> 19:10.322
So let's keep this quiet,
Murdoch. No need for a panic.

19:10.389 --> 19:12.223
What kind of person would
randomly target people

19:12.291 --> 19:14.259
as they walked by?

19:14.327 --> 19:16.895
I suspect we're looking
for a sequential killer.

19:16.963 --> 19:19.431
- A sequential killer?
- It's my coinage.

19:19.499 --> 19:22.200
It refers to killers who
murder multiple victims,

19:22.268 --> 19:24.735
one at a time, usually separated
by a period of a few days

19:24.803 --> 19:26.737
- to several months.
- Jack the Ripper.

19:26.805 --> 19:29.707
The most famous, but
there have been others.

19:29.775 --> 19:32.677
Joseph Vacher killed 11.
H. H. Holmes killed dozens,

19:32.744 --> 19:34.679
possibly hundreds.

19:34.746 --> 19:38.148
Were there any similarities
between the victims?

19:38.216 --> 19:40.217
Jack killed only women.

19:40.285 --> 19:42.486
Vacher tended to kill teenagers.

19:42.553 --> 19:46.155
Holmes killed anyone who would
cross his path, it would seem.

19:46.223 --> 19:49.258
But why? Why did they do it?

19:49.326 --> 19:52.195
No one knows. The Ripper was never caught,

19:52.262 --> 19:54.965
and the others were executed
before they could be studied.

19:55.032 --> 19:56.932
Were they insane?

19:57.000 --> 19:59.201
Some maybe but not all.

19:59.268 --> 20:01.837
The only thing we can say with certainty

20:01.905 --> 20:04.773
is that they felt a compulsion to kill.

20:04.841 --> 20:07.810
All you who walk in
the shadow of ignorance,

20:07.878 --> 20:11.714
who deny the true light of God.

20:11.781 --> 20:14.081
All you who stare at the ground

20:14.149 --> 20:18.219
in contemplation of your own selfish wants.

20:18.286 --> 20:20.488
You have no idea what I'm capable of.

20:20.556 --> 20:23.925
The blood on my hands. No.
I'm the one who's talking...

20:23.993 --> 20:26.995
Good day, Billy. Take
care of yourself, now.

20:28.997 --> 20:30.898
- Mrs. Lynd.
- Oh, Constable!

20:30.965 --> 20:33.233
I'm sorry to show you
such a frightful picture,

20:33.300 --> 20:35.268
but we need to know if
you've seen this man.

20:35.336 --> 20:37.538
Oh, dear heavens, not another one.

20:37.605 --> 20:39.540
This man was killed 2 weeks ago.

20:39.607 --> 20:42.609
Oh dear. Let me see.

20:42.677 --> 20:44.310
Yes.

20:44.378 --> 20:47.580
I know him, he was a pastor.

20:47.648 --> 20:50.416
My dear Jack was in the ministry
as well. Anglican he was.

20:50.483 --> 20:54.286
Mrs. Lynd, do you recall seeing
him 2 weeks ago on May the 11th?

20:54.354 --> 20:57.623
- That was a Friday.
- Uh...

20:57.691 --> 21:00.792
Yes. He went into the tailor shop.

21:03.395 --> 21:06.531
Yes, pastor Henshaw was a customer.

21:06.599 --> 21:08.633
And was he here on May 11th?

21:16.141 --> 21:19.376
He put $10 on Spendthrift to win. He lost.

21:19.444 --> 21:22.079
- Was he a regular?
- Every week.

21:22.146 --> 21:24.647
Thank you very much.
How are you doing today?

21:24.715 --> 21:26.749
Come on in. Come on in...

21:26.817 --> 21:29.018
Bloody preacher playing the ponies.

21:29.086 --> 21:31.020
- Not what you'd expect.
- I know what you mean, sir.

21:31.088 --> 21:34.557
I used to think of this
corner as being so...

21:34.625 --> 21:37.660
bright and lively, and now
it just seems full of...

21:37.728 --> 21:40.396
- menace.
- Repent now!

21:40.464 --> 21:44.766
On your knees and pray!

21:44.834 --> 21:46.768
You have no idea what I'm capable of.

21:50.205 --> 21:51.548
Pizza pie.

21:56.350 --> 21:59.118
What are you hoping to capture here, sir?

21:59.186 --> 22:01.120
Unusual behaviour.

22:01.188 --> 22:03.456
Does our killer stand and watch?

22:03.524 --> 22:05.891
Does he argue with his victims?

22:05.959 --> 22:07.892
Does he follow them? That sort of thing.

22:07.960 --> 22:10.295
And if there is another murder?

22:10.363 --> 22:13.298
Well then I'll have the evidence
I need to catch him, won't I?

22:13.366 --> 22:16.067
Sir, I have another theory.

22:16.135 --> 22:18.370
- Go on.
- Well, we know that we're looking

22:18.438 --> 22:20.372
for a sequential killer like
Jack the Ripper, but something

22:20.440 --> 22:23.407
you may not know sir, is that
Jack the Ripper's last victim

22:23.475 --> 22:25.743
was a prostitute who was
favoured by none other

22:25.811 --> 22:27.712
than the Prince of Wales.

22:27.779 --> 22:29.580
Indeed!

22:29.648 --> 22:31.649
Oh, it's a fact, sir. It's also established

22:31.717 --> 22:34.017
that at the time of her
death, she was with child.

22:34.085 --> 22:36.053
And of course it's widely suspected

22:36.120 --> 22:38.055
that the child was the prince's.

22:38.122 --> 22:40.323
Now of course, the monarchy couldn't have

22:40.391 --> 22:43.326
some bastard pretender to
the throne running around,

22:43.394 --> 22:45.695
so many people believe they had her killed!

22:45.763 --> 22:49.399
George, why are we
discussing Jack the Ripper?

22:49.467 --> 22:53.202
- Pass me the film magazine.
- To illustrate my point, sir.

22:53.270 --> 22:56.805
Perhaps only one of these
murders was truly motivated.

22:56.873 --> 22:59.742
The others were simply committed
to deflect our attention

22:59.809 --> 23:01.744
from that one true motive.

23:01.811 --> 23:04.680
And what would that motive be?

23:04.748 --> 23:06.648
Well, sir, the very fact
that we haven't discovered

23:06.716 --> 23:08.617
a motive yet leads me to believe

23:08.685 --> 23:10.819
that perhaps the one
truly motivated killing

23:10.887 --> 23:12.920
has yet to happen!

23:14.723 --> 23:18.793
An interesting theory, George.

23:20.662 --> 23:22.764
Ahha! Ha!

23:22.831 --> 23:26.133
- So, where are we going to put this, sir?
- George, we know for certain

23:26.201 --> 23:28.635
that all of the victims,
at one time or another,

23:28.703 --> 23:31.471
passed through the intersection
of Carlton and Parliament.

23:31.539 --> 23:34.508
I suggest that the scrutiny
camera would be best set up there.

23:34.575 --> 23:38.177
- Don't be a stranger.
- Come on in, ladies and gentlemen.

23:38.245 --> 23:40.980
So he's hoping to film a murder, then?

23:41.048 --> 23:44.149
Good grief, Higgins! He's not hoping to.

23:44.217 --> 23:46.519
But if there is another murder
it is incumbent on the detective

23:46.586 --> 23:48.521
to gather as much evidence as possible.

23:48.588 --> 23:50.589
I just thought film was very expensive.

23:50.657 --> 23:52.625
Well, it is, but he's rigged it

23:52.692 --> 23:55.060
in such a way that it takes
a picture every 4 seconds.

23:55.128 --> 23:58.230
That allows us to capture a full
day on a single roll of film.

24:02.080 --> 24:02.934
All right. Right there.

24:07.105 --> 24:10.007
There we go.

24:10.075 --> 24:11.976
Now I suppose the rest is up to the camera.

24:17.482 --> 24:20.818
- I'm hungry, George.
- Are you now?

24:20.885 --> 24:24.087
You're right, George, that's really good.

24:26.624 --> 24:29.827
Henry, would I ever steer you wrong.

24:29.894 --> 24:32.161
- Still seems a bit unhygienic.
- Fresh pizza pie!

24:32.228 --> 24:36.799
Fresh pizza pie! One penny a bite!

24:39.202 --> 24:41.838
George, there's $10 in here.

24:41.905 --> 24:44.707
It's half my month's salary!

24:44.775 --> 24:48.477
- What are you suggesting?
- Hmm...

24:48.544 --> 24:51.379
Oh, for Heaven's sake, Henry,
you can't keep the money.

24:51.447 --> 24:54.916
What if we couldn't find the owner?

24:54.984 --> 24:57.118
Well at least, have a look inside.

25:01.991 --> 25:05.926
"If found please deliver
to 349 Parliament Street."

25:10.431 --> 25:13.200
Oh, not this chap again.

25:13.267 --> 25:16.504
Stay away! It's not time! Not time!

25:16.571 --> 25:18.539
Sir, we're on official police
business if you don't mind!

25:18.607 --> 25:20.673
It wasn't my fault.
They wanted me to do it.

25:20.741 --> 25:22.241
Shut up. Shut up! Ok,

25:22.309 --> 25:25.912
I'm just... ok. Shut up. Shut up.

25:25.980 --> 25:29.716
Lunatic!

25:29.783 --> 25:32.251
We're not open until 6.

25:32.319 --> 25:34.220
What's this about?

25:34.287 --> 25:37.188
We found your wallet.

25:40.326 --> 25:42.360
Well...

25:42.428 --> 25:45.531
- thank you.
- You don't want to keep your wallet?

25:45.598 --> 25:48.233
Consider it your reward.

25:50.102 --> 25:52.369
There you go, Henry,
virtue is its own reward.

25:52.437 --> 25:54.639
- You've got a nice new wallet.
- I'd would have preferred

25:54.706 --> 25:58.142
the $10, George.

26:05.651 --> 26:07.584
Anything?

26:07.652 --> 26:09.619
Nothing I can discern, sir.

26:09.687 --> 26:11.655
It's been 2 days since we set this up.

26:11.722 --> 26:13.723
- He's due to strike again.
- I know.

26:13.791 --> 26:17.326
Sirs...

26:17.394 --> 26:20.897
Like the rest, Robert Grimsby
was shot through the heart.

26:20.965 --> 26:23.033
And the markings on this
bullet match the others.

26:23.100 --> 26:25.067
The time of death?

26:25.134 --> 26:27.369
Difficult to tell precisely
using body temperature.

26:27.437 --> 26:29.972
But I've analysed his stomach contents

26:30.040 --> 26:32.507
and can say with confidence
that he ate his last meal

26:32.576 --> 26:34.743
45 minutes before his death.

26:34.811 --> 26:36.879
Corned beef on rye bread.

26:49.058 --> 26:52.359
Sirs. I spoke to the owner
of the Sumach restaurant.

26:52.427 --> 26:55.262
Mr. Grimsby stopped by last
night for corned beef on rye.

26:55.330 --> 26:57.798
- What time was this?
- Between 8:15 and 8:25.

26:57.865 --> 27:00.467
That puts our murder sometime after 9pm.

27:00.534 --> 27:04.137
Sir, stop the projector!

27:04.205 --> 27:07.273
That's Robert Grimsby there,
arguing with the butcher.

27:07.341 --> 27:10.577
- So?
- This is proof of my theory.

27:10.645 --> 27:12.645
What is he rabbiting on about, Murdoch?

27:12.713 --> 27:16.449
Sir, George suspects that the
first 3 murders were random,

27:16.517 --> 27:18.818
to disguise the true
motivation of our killer.

27:18.885 --> 27:22.122
There's only one truly motivated
murder and this is that murder.

27:22.189 --> 27:25.158
- So what is the motivation?
- Hatred. Pure and simple.

27:25.226 --> 27:27.627
The butcher killed the tailor.

27:27.694 --> 27:31.130
The final blow in an ongoing feud.

27:31.197 --> 27:33.898
I never said I hated him.

27:33.966 --> 27:36.835
But you turned him in to the police.

27:36.902 --> 27:40.339
He was operating a gambling
business right next to my store.

27:40.406 --> 27:43.008
Yes. And you owed him money.

27:43.075 --> 27:46.277
You wouldn't have to
pay him if he were dead.

27:46.345 --> 27:48.279
Where were you last evening?

27:48.347 --> 27:51.048
Minding my own business.

27:51.116 --> 27:53.050
You have no alibi?

27:53.118 --> 27:54.885
I keep to myself. No crime in that.

27:54.953 --> 27:57.087
What about May the 11th, 17th,

27:57.156 --> 27:59.089
24th and 26th?

27:59.158 --> 28:01.124
What about 'em?

28:01.192 --> 28:03.426
Can you account for your
whereabouts on those evenings?

28:05.829 --> 28:09.498
Why? You think I had something
to do with those other murders?

28:09.566 --> 28:12.834
Why would I kill those
people? I didn't even know 'em.

28:12.902 --> 28:14.870
That was precisely the point, wasn't it?

28:14.937 --> 28:18.274
You randomly murder 3 people
to throw us off the scent.

28:18.341 --> 28:19.741
What?

28:19.809 --> 28:21.977
It's our belief

28:22.045 --> 28:24.212
that you killed the others in
order to disguise your motive

28:24.280 --> 28:26.214
for killing Mr. Grimsby.

28:26.282 --> 28:29.417
You 2 are crazy!

28:29.485 --> 28:32.053
He's a gruff old bastard,
I'll give you that,

28:32.120 --> 28:35.323
but to cold-bloodedly kill 3 innocent
people to throw us off the scent?

28:35.391 --> 28:37.625
Call it copper's instinct,
Murdoch, but I just don't think

28:37.693 --> 28:39.561
the old bugger has it in him.

28:39.628 --> 28:41.796
Anything, George?

28:41.863 --> 28:45.166
Possibly, sir. Watch this.

28:45.233 --> 28:47.835
Here's Robert Grimsby going into the bank.

28:49.871 --> 28:52.807
And here he is coming
out. And then he stops

28:52.874 --> 28:55.842
to pick something up, but
I can't figure out what.

28:55.910 --> 28:57.977
Right, George,

28:58.045 --> 29:00.446
enlarge this section. Sir.

29:02.349 --> 29:04.650
Sirs...

29:04.719 --> 29:07.486
it appears to be a wallet
that Grimsby is picking up.

29:07.554 --> 29:10.323
The thing is, Higgins and I found a wallet

29:10.390 --> 29:12.825
in almost the exact same location.

29:16.696 --> 29:18.997
- Crikey.
- Help yourselves.

29:19.065 --> 29:21.600
Really? I find this one quite handsome.

29:21.667 --> 29:24.737
George.

29:24.804 --> 29:27.339
None of these wallets belong to you?

29:27.406 --> 29:30.908
People have been finding them on
the street every couple of days.

29:30.976 --> 29:34.278
I've been thinking of building a drop box.
Save me from having to answer the door.

29:35.346 --> 29:37.715
Hm, and they all have your address in them?

29:37.783 --> 29:39.348
- And money usually.
- How much?

29:39.349 --> 29:41.109
If it's there, $10.

29:41.353 --> 29:43.954
Did that not strike you as a little odd?

29:44.021 --> 29:46.022
Of course it does.

29:46.090 --> 29:48.258
But I'll take donations
any way I can get them.

29:48.325 --> 29:51.728
How many of the wallets
had no money in them.

29:51.796 --> 29:53.630
Four.

30:02.038 --> 30:05.407
Edgar Leeman had recently come
into money and was in good spirits.

30:05.475 --> 30:08.077
Thelma Greene was seen counting
money outside of the bank.

30:08.145 --> 30:10.445
Pastor Henshaw made a $10 bet.

30:10.513 --> 30:12.381
He must have thought that
he had God in his corner.

30:12.448 --> 30:14.416
Four wallets, four deaths, sir.

30:14.484 --> 30:16.417
If you returned the money, you lived.

30:16.485 --> 30:18.519
If you kept it, you died.

30:22.715 --> 30:25.314
On the face of it, it seems to
be some kind of morality test.

30:26.326 --> 30:29.169
A morality test? Designed by a murderer?

30:29.606 --> 30:32.173
It's less ironic than it seems.

30:32.241 --> 30:36.044
Cold-blooded killers can have
strict codes of moral behaviour.

30:36.112 --> 30:39.447
Heavens, God himself wasn't above smiting
people who didn't measure up to his standards.

30:39.515 --> 30:42.783
Could our killer be a religious zealot?

30:42.851 --> 30:45.720
- There is one on the corner.
- Oh, my goodness! He stands on a soapbox

30:45.787 --> 30:48.188
and preaches hell and damnation all day.

30:48.256 --> 30:51.591
And he was less than cooperative
when it came to the investigation.

30:51.659 --> 30:53.593
Now, there is also a beggar who mills about

30:53.661 --> 30:55.029
outside the Parliament
Street Mission. I don't know

30:55.096 --> 30:57.631
if he's religious, but
he's definitely off his nut.

30:57.698 --> 31:01.168
Yes. We know our killer is angry.

31:01.236 --> 31:03.170
What could he be angry about?

31:03.238 --> 31:06.005
It's hard to say. He may
not even know himself.

31:06.073 --> 31:08.674
Anger of this magnitude is often displaced.

31:08.742 --> 31:12.278
Sigmund Freud has speculated
that our subconscious mind

31:12.346 --> 31:14.280
prevents us from expressing
our anger directly

31:14.348 --> 31:16.182
to the person responsible,

31:16.250 --> 31:18.251
forcing us to take our anger
out on persons unconnected

31:18.318 --> 31:20.252
to the true source of our rage.

31:20.319 --> 31:23.755
So, say if a police inspector

31:23.822 --> 31:25.924
was yelled at by his wife,
and then in turn takes it out

31:25.991 --> 31:28.427
- on an unsuspecting constable...
- George.

31:28.494 --> 31:31.863
- Suddenly makes sense, sir.
- This could explain

31:31.931 --> 31:33.865
why sequential killers...

31:33.933 --> 31:36.000
pick their victims apparently at random.

31:36.068 --> 31:37.935
Exactly.

31:40.405 --> 31:42.440
Sir, what are we looking for?

31:42.507 --> 31:44.308
Well, George, if we can
see who placed the wallet,

31:44.376 --> 31:48.045
then we'll have our murderer.

31:48.113 --> 31:50.381
The soapbox preacher just went by.

31:50.449 --> 31:53.450
As did 2 dozen others.

31:53.517 --> 31:55.751
Any one of them could have dropped it.

31:55.819 --> 31:58.754
For all we know the wallet could
have been lying there for hours.

31:58.822 --> 32:00.856
Then we'll set up a surveillance.

32:00.924 --> 32:03.326
We know exactly where
the wallet is dropped.

32:03.394 --> 32:05.495
Crabtree and Higgins will be on
the streets. Civilian clothes.

32:05.563 --> 32:07.530
We'll watch from upstairs.

32:07.598 --> 32:09.498
"We", sir?

32:09.566 --> 32:12.367
It's my bloody case too, Murdoch.

32:14.504 --> 32:16.705
Honestly, George, this is so tedious.

32:16.772 --> 32:18.740
Do you remember that time we
had to crawl through the sewer

32:18.808 --> 32:20.385
and look for the evidence
that detective Murdoch thought

32:20.386 --> 32:22.744
- had been flushed?
- Ugh! How can I forget?

32:22.812 --> 32:25.346
- This is worse than that.
- How is that, Henry?

32:25.414 --> 32:27.815
Endlessly walking in circles just hoping

32:27.882 --> 32:29.817
we see someone happen to drop a wallet.

32:29.884 --> 32:33.521
Well, look on the bright side. At
least, we get to wear our civvies.

32:33.589 --> 32:36.991
- That's the best you got?
- Well, you know, it could be worse for you, Higgins.

32:37.058 --> 32:40.527
- How's that?
- You could be me having to listen to you complain.

32:42.696 --> 32:45.165
Should have got Margaret
to make us some grub.

32:45.233 --> 32:49.068
George was telling me about
this new Italian dish, sir.

32:49.137 --> 32:51.304
"Pi-zah" pie.

32:51.372 --> 32:53.740
Italian? Oh...

32:53.807 --> 32:55.808
I'm strictly a meat-and-two-veg
kind of fellow, Murdoch.

32:55.876 --> 32:58.444
Oh, where's your sense of adventure sir?

33:00.447 --> 33:02.414
Why, Constable Crabtree.

33:02.482 --> 33:04.550
- Ah!
- You're out of uniform.

33:04.618 --> 33:07.820
Well, you know, Mrs. Lynd, even coppers
get a day off every now and then.

33:07.888 --> 33:09.756
Well, you're very smartly dressed.

33:09.823 --> 33:11.824
- Oh, thank you.
- Not like some these days.

33:11.892 --> 33:13.792
We have a big sale going on

33:13.860 --> 33:16.294
on all the meats I have in the sh!!

33:20.499 --> 33:22.367
Henry.

33:28.074 --> 33:30.541
- How to get there?
- $10.

33:30.608 --> 33:32.977
It's swallowing down my path.

33:33.045 --> 33:36.180
Blast! I'm calling the detective.

33:36.247 --> 33:38.849
He's better because he is everywhere.

33:38.917 --> 33:41.451
What is his address?
Where does the devil live?

33:44.556 --> 33:46.956
- Yes?
- Hello, sir.

33:47.024 --> 33:49.993
We found the wallet, but we
didn't see who dropped it.

33:50.061 --> 33:53.063
That's all right,
George. Stick to the plan.

33:53.130 --> 33:56.766
Make a big show of counting
the money, and then...

33:56.834 --> 33:59.936
spend it, as if this is the
greatest day of your life.

34:00.004 --> 34:02.071
Yes, sir.

34:02.138 --> 34:04.540
Sin is not just killing

34:04.608 --> 34:07.910
and stealing. Sin lies in the very thoughts

34:07.977 --> 34:10.612
that slither through your mind.

34:10.681 --> 34:13.716
It wasn't my fault. She wanted me to do it.

34:13.783 --> 34:16.686
Evil. Hoo-hoo! Hoo-hoo!
I know when I see it.

34:16.753 --> 34:18.719
- Hmhm, hm-hm, hm-hm!
- Don't you want to come in?

34:18.786 --> 34:20.722
- Come on inside!
- There's no grass

34:20.789 --> 34:24.192
amongst us, but there is a snake
amongst us. There is no grass...

34:24.260 --> 34:26.628
Absolutely, sir. Inside.

34:26.696 --> 34:29.996
He's off to buy a bloody hat.

34:30.065 --> 34:33.301
I didn't tell him what to
spend the money on, sir.

34:33.369 --> 34:36.036
Excellent selection sir.

34:36.105 --> 34:38.706
- That is one of our finest.
- Well, you know I've always been

34:38.774 --> 34:42.409
partial to a Leghorn Flop, and
nothing but the best for my gal.

34:42.476 --> 34:45.913
- I've just come into some money.
- Come back anytime.

34:45.981 --> 34:49.016
I will do. Thank you, ma'am.

34:52.585 --> 34:54.821
Well, thank you kindly.

34:54.889 --> 34:57.390
- You enjoy that now.
- Ah, thank you, sir.

34:59.360 --> 35:01.294
There goes another happy customer, folks.

35:01.362 --> 35:03.630
George. Stick to the
plan. Head on home now.

35:03.697 --> 35:06.932
Sir.

35:24.784 --> 35:27.718
- Were you followed?
- Oh, sweet mother of... Sir!

35:27.786 --> 35:30.087
Yes, there was a chap
about a block behind me,

35:30.155 --> 35:33.123
but he appears to have veered off.

35:33.191 --> 35:36.059
Do you think he knows where you live?

35:36.127 --> 35:38.629
I imagine so.

35:43.934 --> 35:46.135
- Put this on.
- The bulletproof vest, sir?

35:46.203 --> 35:48.171
Do you really think that's necessary?

35:48.238 --> 35:50.873
Oh, bugalugs! If you get
shot, do you want to be dead?

35:52.710 --> 35:54.444
Good point, sir.

36:11.128 --> 36:13.696
- Who is it?
- It's me, George.

36:15.965 --> 36:17.899
I've been watching from
across the street all night.

36:17.967 --> 36:19.901
I haven't seen anyone as much as slow down.

36:19.969 --> 36:21.837
I don't think our killer is coming tonight.

36:21.904 --> 36:24.306
Do you think he's
figured out it's a set-up?

36:24.373 --> 36:26.374
I don't know. Perhaps he recognized you

36:26.442 --> 36:28.877
as a constable and decided
not to follow through.

36:28.945 --> 36:30.945
Ah... I'm sorry, sir.

36:31.012 --> 36:32.980
It's not your fault, Crabtree.

36:33.048 --> 36:35.749
Get some sleep, lad.
We'll try again tomorrow.

36:57.037 --> 36:59.739
Constable Crabtree?

36:59.806 --> 37:02.941
I have a treat for you!

37:06.279 --> 37:08.713
Mrs. Lynd, you've brought me another pie!

37:08.781 --> 37:10.715
You shouldn't have.

37:10.783 --> 37:12.784
Oh! And plum. You know,
that's my favourite!

37:12.852 --> 37:15.387
You'll have to come in for a slice...

37:15.454 --> 37:18.190
She's still talking to
me. You know, she knows

37:18.258 --> 37:21.292
- I'm telling the truth...
- Hey! Hey, come on!

37:23.661 --> 37:26.097
One of these people is our killer, Murdoch.

37:26.164 --> 37:28.465
- Possibly, sir.
- Think about it.

37:28.533 --> 37:30.567
Whoever dropped the wallet had
to wait until the next victim

37:30.635 --> 37:33.304
picked it up. Who better
to do that than somebody

37:33.372 --> 37:35.372
who made it their business to be here?

37:39.576 --> 37:41.644
Do you think that's the old dear's?

37:41.712 --> 37:43.679
Belongs to Mrs. Lynd.

37:43.747 --> 37:47.517
- She's always leaving it here.
- Where is Mrs. Lynd?

37:47.584 --> 37:49.819
How could you?

37:49.887 --> 37:52.788
Such a nice young man and
a police constable too.

37:52.855 --> 37:55.024
- All rig, , Mrs. Lynd...
- What hope is there

37:55.091 --> 37:57.293
for the world if even
the police aren't honest?

37:57.360 --> 37:59.194
Mrs. Lynd, you've got it all wrong.

37:59.262 --> 38:01.563
- I didn't steal that wallet.
- I saw you!

38:01.631 --> 38:04.266
You bought a hat and a ham.

38:04.334 --> 38:06.435
The same ham that's sitting right there.

38:06.502 --> 38:09.337
No, Mrs. Lynd, this was all a set-up.

38:09.405 --> 38:12.240
- A what?
- We knew all about the wallets that you've been dropping.

38:12.308 --> 38:15.143
I took that money to set myself up as bait.

38:15.210 --> 38:18.512
We were trying to catch the killer.

38:18.580 --> 38:20.548
- Oh, I don't know about that...
- Mrs. Lynd, look at this.

38:20.615 --> 38:24.084
This is a bulletproof
vest. I wore this last night

38:24.152 --> 38:26.453
in case the killer showed
up and tried to shoot me.

38:28.622 --> 38:30.857
But you're not wearing one now.

38:30.925 --> 38:32.759
This time of morning she's usually visiting

38:32.827 --> 38:34.761
the grave of her "saintly" Jack.

38:34.829 --> 38:36.763
You don't think he was a saint?

38:36.831 --> 38:40.032
Sorry, did I just betray my thoughts?

38:40.100 --> 38:42.901
He preyed on every widow
in his congregation.

38:42.970 --> 38:44.837
He even made a pass at me one time.

38:44.904 --> 38:47.673
My... did Mrs. Lynd know this?

38:47.740 --> 38:50.943
She found his letters after he died.

38:51.011 --> 38:54.013
Some people just can't
face up to the truth.

38:56.215 --> 38:57.849
Come and get it while it's hot!

38:57.916 --> 39:00.718
Because you know that
won't last long, I swear!

39:00.786 --> 39:03.355
About the same width as a cane, sir.

39:03.422 --> 39:05.357
Very unlikely, Murdoch.

39:05.424 --> 39:07.725
She always had her nose in the Bible.

39:07.793 --> 39:10.028
And she's an old woman.

39:12.797 --> 39:16.566
I doubt she'd be a murderer.

39:27.644 --> 39:30.146
George.

39:34.084 --> 39:36.752
So now you have a decision to
make of your own, Mrs. Lynd.

39:36.820 --> 39:40.623
You can either give me that gun...

39:40.690 --> 39:43.225
or kill an innocent man.

39:48.464 --> 39:50.432
It's not fair.

39:50.500 --> 39:52.934
Mrs. Lynd, please give me that gun.

40:02.978 --> 40:06.213
- George!
- Sir, it's all right.

40:06.281 --> 40:08.783
Hello.

40:16.127 --> 40:19.663
Back in my day... people were honest.

40:19.731 --> 40:21.765
If you found someone's purse,

40:21.833 --> 40:24.301
you just gave it back to them,

40:24.368 --> 40:26.236
never even expecting a reward.

40:26.304 --> 40:28.305
But now they just take the money out,

40:28.372 --> 40:31.107
and they throw everything else away.

40:33.044 --> 40:35.812
The world changed when your
husband died, didn't it?

40:35.879 --> 40:39.349
Yes, it did.

40:39.417 --> 40:41.884
It got mean and ugly.

40:41.953 --> 40:45.254
And the more I thought
about it, the angrier I got.

40:45.322 --> 40:48.324
- So you set up a test?
- Yes, I did.

40:48.391 --> 40:52.161
I wanted to see. I mean,
who would do such a thing?

40:52.228 --> 40:54.430
I thought at first a...

40:54.497 --> 40:57.732
a vagabond, a prostitute...

40:57.800 --> 40:59.734
but a pastor...

40:59.802 --> 41:01.735
a minister of the church!

41:01.803 --> 41:04.705
He should have known better.

41:04.773 --> 41:08.309
Like your husband.

41:08.377 --> 41:11.912
He was a pastor too, wasn't he?

41:11.981 --> 41:14.048
Jack never let me down.

41:14.116 --> 41:16.350
He saw that I'd be well taken care of.

41:16.417 --> 41:19.119
Your husband violated your marriage vows.

41:19.187 --> 41:21.788
This isn't about Jack!

41:21.856 --> 41:25.058
This is about thieving and hypocrisy...

41:25.126 --> 41:29.429
people who have no sense
of common decency...

41:29.497 --> 41:32.465
people who think they can do
anything and get away with it!

41:35.268 --> 41:38.104
They deserved to die.

41:38.171 --> 41:40.639
All of them!

41:48.647 --> 41:50.648
She's as batty as they come.

41:50.716 --> 41:52.917
Imagine killing someone over a wallet.

41:52.985 --> 41:54.919
It wasn't about a wallet.

41:54.987 --> 41:57.354
Her husband was a church minister.

41:57.422 --> 41:59.423
She believed he was morally infallible.

41:59.491 --> 42:01.526
When she learned otherwise,

42:01.593 --> 42:03.561
her conscious mind just
couldn't face the truth.

42:03.629 --> 42:06.631
Yet her subconscious was still
seething with hurt and anger.

42:06.698 --> 42:09.834
Which she had to direct
somewhere, hence the moral test.

42:09.902 --> 42:13.403
Like I said, batty as they come.

42:13.470 --> 42:17.140
Pizza pie is more of a meal

42:17.207 --> 42:19.509
than dessert, but it
tastes just as good as pie,

42:19.577 --> 42:22.012
so in my opinion, it could
be your meal and your dessert.

42:22.079 --> 42:24.047
- What kind of food is this?
- It's Italian!

42:24.114 --> 42:26.416
Ah! Italian, how exotic, George!

42:26.483 --> 42:28.984
- How much for a slice, sir?
- A nickel.

42:29.052 --> 42:32.821
- Two then, please.
- Oh!

42:37.126 --> 42:39.094
Mmm! It's delicious!

42:39.162 --> 42:41.030
- And practical.
- Practical?

42:41.097 --> 42:43.064
Emily, think.

42:43.131 --> 42:46.000
Pizza pie serves as its
own plate. No dishes.

42:46.068 --> 42:48.536
Hmmm... it would be handy to have at home.

42:48.604 --> 42:51.138
- Perfect for a bachelor.
- Or a working woman.

42:51.206 --> 42:53.708
You know, if that man used his bicycle...

42:53.776 --> 42:55.710
He could deliver it right to your door.

42:55.778 --> 42:57.912
Exactly, George. We really
should starting writing down

42:57.980 --> 42:59.980
more of our ideas.

43:04.385 --> 43:06.286
Pizza pie! Fresh pizza pie!

43:06.353 --> 43:08.722
I still, I still talk to her.

43:08.790 --> 43:11.024
And pure in God's footsteps...

43:11.092 --> 43:13.727
- I still talk to her.
- It shall find you.

43:23.234 --> 43:24.234
Next Monday,

43:24.302 --> 43:25.770
on an all-new Murdoch Mysteries...

43:25.837 --> 43:26.604
You ready?

43:26.671 --> 43:27.605
I'm the boss!

43:27.672 --> 43:29.407
Someone was looking for something.

43:29.474 --> 43:31.709
Who's the bloke dressed as Sherlock Holmes?

43:31.777 --> 43:33.843
He claims to be Sherlock Holmes.

43:33.911 --> 43:35.678
An all-new Murdoch Mysteries,

43:35.746 --> 43:37.914
next Monday at 9:00 on CBC.
