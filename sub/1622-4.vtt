Oh Lord Tyrion. Come in, come in.

04:47.980 --> 04:51.790
I hope we might speak in confidence.

04:52.720 --> 04:55.330
Oh. Always in confidence.

04:55.390 --> 04:57.840
About the events of the Backwater.

04:58.960 --> 05:00.400
Perhaps this is the wrong time?

05:00.530 --> 05:02.010
Oh no it's a wonderful time.

05:03.230 --> 05:05.300
I thought one of your little birds might

05:05.470 --> 05:07.500
Have knowledge of my
sister's intentions to...

05:07.570 --> 05:09.380
End your life?

05:09.470 --> 05:11.240
I didn't inherit Littlefinger's spies

05:11.370 --> 05:13.180
along with his position, Fm afraid.

05:13.670 --> 05:16.710
Which is why I'm coming to you.
I need proof.

05:16.810 --> 05:19.050
Proof? (SNORTS) Will there be a trial?

05:19.150 --> 05:20.180
I need to know.

05:21.480 --> 05:24.490
I have no proof, only whispers.

05:24.650 --> 05:25.930
(GRUNTS)

05:28.020 --> 05:31.060
Before all this nastiness,

05:31.160 --> 05:35.000
I was going to tell you
the story of how I was cut.

05:35.060 --> 05:36.370
Do you want to hear it still?

05:36.430 --> 05:38.210
I don't know. Do I?

05:39.000 --> 05:43.570
As a boy, I traveled with a troupe of
actors through the Free Cities

05:43.670 --> 05:45.620
One day in Myr,

05:45.710 --> 05:50.350
a certain man made
my master an offer too tempting to refuse

05:50.410 --> 05:52.690
I feared the man meant to use me

05:52.850 --> 05:55.090
as I'd heard some men used small boys.

05:55.180 --> 05:57.690
But what he wanted was far worse.

05:59.020 --> 06:02.630
He gave me a potion
that made me powerless to move or speak,

06:02.720 --> 06:05.730
yet did nothing to dull my senses.

06:05.790 --> 06:08.360
With a hooked blade he sliced me,

06:08.530 --> 06:11.100
root and stem. chanting all the while.

06:11.200 --> 06:14.650
He burned my parts in a brazier.

06:14.740 --> 06:19.880
The ﬂames turned We
and I heard a voice answer has call.

06:24.880 --> 06:27.480
I still dream of that night.

06:28.780 --> 06:32.230
Not of the sorcerer, not of his blade.

06:33.390 --> 06:35.770
I dream of the voice from the flames.

06:35.820 --> 06:39.630
Was it a god? A demon? A conjuror's trick?

06:39.730 --> 06:41.970
I don't know.

06:42.060 --> 06:45.310
But the sorcerer called
and a voice answered.

06:45.400 --> 06:51.650
And ever since that day, I have hated magic
and all those who practice it.

06:51.740 --> 06:54.450
But you can see why I was
eager to aid in your

06:54.570 --> 06:57.320
fight against Stannis
and his red priestess.

06:57.410 --> 06:59.950
A symbolic revenge of sons.

07:00.010 --> 07:01.190
Yes.

07:01.620 --> 07:02.650
(CLEARS THROAT)

07:02.750 --> 07:05.860
I feel the need for actual revenge against

07:05.990 --> 07:09.160
the actual person who
tried to have me killed,

07:09.760 --> 07:13.000
which will require
a degree of influence, which...

07:13.090 --> 07:17.200
You do not possess at the moment.

07:18.200 --> 07:23.670
But influence is
largely a matter of patience, I have found.

07:23.770 --> 07:26.650
Once I had served the sorcerer's purpose,

07:26.770 --> 07:29.690
he threw me out of his house to die.

07:29.780 --> 07:33.950
I resolved to live to spite him.

07:34.010 --> 07:35.520
I begged.

07:35.620 --> 07:38.690
I sold what pans of my body remained to me.

07:38.790 --> 07:41.030
I became an excellent thief,

07:41.120 --> 07:44.690
and soon learned that
the contents of a man's letters

07:44.790 --> 07:48.570
are more valuable
than the contents of ms purse

07:48.660 --> 07:53.870
Step by step.
one distasteful task after another,

07:53.970 --> 07:59.510
I made my way from the shims of Myr
to the Small Council chamber

08:02.680 --> 08:05.490
Inﬂuence grows like a weed.

08:06.680 --> 08:09.390
I tended mine patiently

08:09.480 --> 08:12.760
until its tendrils reached
from the Red Keep

08:12.890 --> 08:16.200
all the way across to the
far side of the world,

08:16.260 --> 08:21.370
where I managed
to wrap them around something very special

08:24.500 --> 08:26.240
Ugh.

08:26.330 --> 08:27.510
The sorcerer.

08:28.200 --> 08:29.740
(WHIMPERING)

08:30.000 --> 08:33.250
Hello' my old friend.

08:33.340 --> 08:36.549
It's been a long time.

08:36.610 --> 08:41.390
I have no doubt
the revenge you want will be yours in time,

08:41.450 --> 08:44.400
if you have the stomach for it.

08:46.250 --> 08:47.290
(MUFFLED SCREAMS)

08:47.620 --> 08:49.860
When people talk about the Night's Watch,

08:50.020 --> 08:52.260
they never mention the shoveling.

08:52.360 --> 08:54.600
Or the shit.

08:54.690 --> 08:56.700
GRENN: They tell you about honor,

08:56.800 --> 08:58.780
pardoning crimes, and protecting the ream,

08:58.870 --> 09:03.250
but shoveling really is most of it.

09:03.300 --> 09:06.410
And getting attacked or killed or worse.

09:06.470 --> 09:07.580
And that.

09:07.640 --> 09:10.820
But when you're not getting attacked or
killed, usually you're shoveling.

09:12.110 --> 09:15.220
Ah, look. More shit.

09:16.380 --> 09:20.130
I was starting to wonder
what to do with the rest of me day.

09:20.220 --> 09:22.330
We need to get out of here.

09:23.560 --> 09:26.090
When the Lord Commander
says we go we go.

09:26.160 --> 09:29.140
The Lord Commander
told us to go to the Fist of the First Men.

09:29.230 --> 09:30.470
How'd that turn out for us?

09:30.600 --> 09:31.840
He had no way of knowing.

09:31.930 --> 09:34.970
We do now. We know what's out there.

09:35.070 --> 09:38.310
Craster's been out here surviving.

09:38.410 --> 09:42.320
So he's your
new protector now? Our good friend Craster?

09:42.410 --> 09:44.150
We're like the sons he never had.

09:44.240 --> 09:46.590
RAST: Mormont isn't gonna save you.

09:46.650 --> 09:49.820
This lummox here isn't gonna save you.

09:49.920 --> 09:54.490
When the Walkers come calling, Craster will
serve us up like so many pigs.

09:55.420 --> 09:57.600
If we want to live,

09:59.590 --> 10:01.830
we'll have to look out for ourselves.

I don't have time for anyone but him

12:31.780 --> 12:33.760
No larger than usual, apparently.

12:33.810 --> 12:35.260
And yet, they said that he was...

12:35.350 --> 12:36.760
Extraordinary.

12:36.820 --> 12:40.820
The most extraordinary man they've ever
had. And they've had a lot of men.

12:40.920 --> 12:42.800
We're talking about the same Podrick?

12:42.860 --> 12:46.930
The quiet boy in
Lord Tyrion's service? Seems a bit simple?

12:48.460 --> 12:49.870
What did he do to them?

12:50.000 --> 12:51.370
I don't know, my lord.

12:51.460 --> 12:53.670
The girls are usually quite descriptive.

12:53.770 --> 12:55.610
So what did they say?

12:55.670 --> 12:58.780
They said it was hard to describe.

12:58.840 --> 12:59.840
Huh.

13:01.040 --> 13:05.180
Prodigies appear in the oddest of places.

13:05.280 --> 13:09.350
And what did
Littlefinger say about this loss of income?

13:09.450 --> 13:11.400
He was too preoccupied to notice.

13:11.520 --> 13:13.500
He's leaving for the Eyrie soon.

13:13.550 --> 13:15.460
I'm helping him prepare for his journey.

13:15.520 --> 13:18.470
Ah, yes, to pursue his enduring love of the

13:18.630 --> 13:21.540
Lady Arryn and the title
that comes with her.

13:21.630 --> 13:23.700
Sad, really.

13:23.800 --> 13:26.140
Is that all it takes to make our friend

13:26.300 --> 13:28.680
Lose interest m poor Sansa Stark?

13:29.840 --> 13:33.150
He hasn't spoken to her
since the last time, as far as I know.

13:33.210 --> 13:34.210
Hmm.

13:34.310 --> 13:35.790
But I don't think he's lost interest.

13:36.980 --> 13:38.920
What makes you say so?

13:40.710 --> 13:42.090
His shipboard inventory.

I'm missing something obvious
you're about to point out?

13:55.660 --> 13:57.070
Two featherbeds.

13:57.160 --> 13:59.010
He's bringing two
featherbeds for the cabin.

14:01.870 --> 14:04.510
Who is important enough to Littlefinger

14:04.600 --> 14:07.240
to merit a featherbed,
besides Littlefinger?

14:07.340 --> 14:09.510
Could he be bringing one of his girls?

14:09.580 --> 14:11.720
He's not interested in them, my lord.

14:11.780 --> 14:13.550
How do you know?

14:13.610 --> 14:15.920
Because I'm one of his girls.

14:16.020 --> 14:19.360
Prodigies in odd maces indeed.

14:21.020 --> 14:23.690
Rhaenyra Targaryen was murdered

14:23.860 --> 14:26.570
by her brother or rather his dragon.

14:26.630 --> 14:29.230
It ate her while her son watched.

14:29.300 --> 14:30.540

14:48.820 --> 14:51.800
There aren't
more than 700 people of any importance.

14:51.890 --> 14:56.160
No the rest are there
to look adoringly upon the 700

14:56.260 --> 15:00.170
to remind them how superior they
must be to have the best seats.

15:00.260 --> 15:04.110
Over there, in that urn,
the ashes of Aerion Targaryen.

15:04.160 --> 15:06.170
Aerion Brightflame, they called him.

15:06.270 --> 15:09.300
He thought drinking wildfire
would turn him into a dragon.

And, of course,
there's the Mad King, killed by my uncle.

15:16.740 --> 15:19.750
Would you like to
see where the last Targaryens are buried?

15:19.810 --> 15:22.820
Are you sure Lady Margaery
doesn't find all this a bit macabre?

15:22.920 --> 15:24.990
No, it's quite all right, Your Grace.

15:25.120 --> 15:27.190
I'd love to see their tombs, really.

15:27.290 --> 15:29.430
It's like taking a walk through history.

15:33.490 --> 15:34.600
JOFFREY: The tomb's just up here.

15:34.760 --> 15:35.830
MARGAERY: This is so exciting.

15:35.930 --> 15:37.310
OLENNA: You were married here, Your Grace?

15:37.430 --> 15:38.810
CERSEI: Yes.

15:38.870 --> 15:40.640
Must seem like only yesterday.

15:40.770 --> 15:42.540
Hmm. Seems like a lifetime ago.

15:42.640 --> 15:44.670
Your husband was buried here as well?

15:44.770 --> 15:47.950
No, he wanted his remains
returned to Storms End.

15:48.010 --> 15:49.150
Such a tragedy.

15:49.210 --> 15:51.520
A fairly predictable tragedy.

15:51.610 --> 15:53.110
Hunting and drinking don't mix.

15:53.280 --> 15:54.780
I should say not.

15:54.850 --> 15:57.290
My son's a hunter. It helps him forget

15:57.380 --> 15:59.830
he's never been within a
mile of a real battle.

15:59.890 --> 16:04.230
I seem to recall he laid siege to Storm's
End for the better part of a year.

16:04.320 --> 16:08.360
All he laid siege to
was the banquet table in the command tent.

16:08.460 --> 16:09.740
(CHUCKLES)

16:09.860 --> 16:11.170
I told him to stay out
of Robert's Rebellion.

16:11.300 --> 16:14.040
He had no business fighting
an actual warrior.

16:16.200 --> 16:20.980
We mothers do what
we canto keep our sons from the grave.

16:21.040 --> 16:23.020
But they do seem to yearn for it.

16:23.080 --> 16:25.990
We shower them with good sense,

16:26.150 --> 16:29.060
and it slides right off,
like rain off a wing.

16:30.380 --> 16:31.560
And yet the world belongs to them.

16:31.680 --> 16:32.860

16:43.000 --> 16:44.770
My father didn't want them here.

16:44.860 --> 16:48.870
He was going to have their bodies burned
and thrown in the Blackwater,

16:48.940 --> 16:51.710
But the High Septon
convinced him otherwise.

16:51.770 --> 16:53.250
I'm glad he did.

16:55.340 --> 16:56.680
I'm sorry, Your Grace.

16:56.740 --> 16:59.520
I know they did terrible things at the end,

16:59.610 --> 17:02.390
but their ancestors built this.

17:04.680 --> 17:08.359
Sometimes severity
is the price we pay for greatness.

they will return it a thousand fold.

17:30.780 --> 17:35.590
I've spoken with them.
I know how they feel about you.

I was only a boy when they took you away.

My father brought us up to the bluffs

"That's Balon Greyjoy's last living son."

20:00.860 --> 20:05.070
He didn't trust me. Thought I was a Stark.

20:05.130 --> 20:07.300
(LAUGHS) I could never be a Stark.

20:07.400 --> 20:09.780
Robb Stark always reminded me of that.

You told them Tarth was full of sapphires.

28:59.500 --> 29:02.480
The city is made brighter by my presence?

Is that your usual line:
Lord Varys? Are you here to seduce me?

29:06.610 --> 29:08.140
A little obvious, perhaps.

29:08.240 --> 29:13.590
Oh no please.
Seduce away It's been so long.

29:13.650 --> 29:16.020
Though I rather think it's all for naught.

29:16.120 --> 29:19.490
What happens when
the nonexistent bumps against the decrepit?

29:20.820 --> 29:22.960
A question for the philosophers.

29:23.020 --> 29:26.000
But you've come mincing
all this way for something.

29:26.090 --> 29:28.090
- So?
- Might I sit?

29:28.160 --> 29:29.260
No.

29:30.200 --> 29:32.970
Come. I've heard you're such a clever man.

29:33.100 --> 29:35.940
I'm curious why you've sought me out.

29:37.200 --> 29:39.710
You've taken an interest in Sansa Stark

29:39.810 --> 29:42.840
Havel?
Because I spoke to her once in this garden

29:42.940 --> 29:45.850
and one of your little spies
came running to tell you?

29:45.940 --> 29:48.360
Why shouldn't I? She's an interesting girl.

29:48.450 --> 29:49.620
Is she?

29:49.780 --> 29:50.990
No. not particularly.

29:51.050 --> 29:52.960
But she's had an interesting childhood.

29:53.120 --> 29:55.030
She has. sadly.

29:55.890 --> 29:58.060
Well, forgive me for
wasting your time, then.

29:58.160 --> 30:01.230
I thought we shared
certain hopes for her well-being.

30:01.330 --> 30:05.330
(CHUCKLING) Come, come.
You surrender rather easily.

30:06.970 --> 30:08.310
Walk with me.

30:08.370 --> 30:12.510
I know the walls have ears,
but apparently the shrubbery does, too

30:12.570 --> 30:18.390
I choose my allies carefully, and
my enemies more carefully still.

30:18.480 --> 30:20.390
Which is Sansa Stark?

30:20.480 --> 30:23.050
Neither. A babe in the woods.

30:23.150 --> 30:24.150
I admired her father.

30:24.250 --> 30:25.250
Yes.

30:25.350 --> 30:27.390
Ned Stark had many admirers,

30:27.490 --> 30:31.430
and how marry stepped forward
when the executioner came for his head?

30:31.520 --> 30:34.870
I could not help Lord Stark.
Perhaps I can help his daughter.

30:34.930 --> 30:36.410
How?

30:36.500 --> 30:39.940
You're not the only one
who has taken an interest in her.

30:40.030 --> 30:44.170
That's hardly surprising.
She's a beautiful girl with a famous name.

30:44.240 --> 30:47.620
Indeed. She'd make a lovely
match for the right suitor.

30:47.710 --> 30:50.590
It almost feels
as if you're about to arrive at the point.

30:50.680 --> 30:53.250
Littlefinger is not long for the capital.

30:53.350 --> 30:55.420
A confidant of mine has told me that

30:55.550 --> 30:57.690
when he goes Sansa Stark goes with him.

30:58.280 --> 31:00.520
And why have you come
to me with this matter?

31:00.590 --> 31:04.430
Littlefinger was born
with no lands, no wealth, no armies.

31:04.520 --> 31:07.940
He has acquired the
first two. How long before he has the army?

31:08.730 --> 31:12.070
Perhaps you'll laugh,
but I know him better than most,

31:12.130 --> 31:14.440
and this is the truth.

31:14.530 --> 31:18.950
Littlefinger is one of
the most dangerous men in Westeros.

31:19.040 --> 31:23.710
If Robb Stark falls,
Sansa Stark is the key to the North.

31:23.780 --> 31:26.760
And if he marries her,
he'll have the key in his pocket

31:26.810 --> 31:28.450
Which seems such a shame.

31:28.550 --> 31:30.580
Why should a man with such a low reputation

31:30.720 --> 31:32.790
steal away such a lovely bride?

31:32.890 --> 31:37.060
You must despise him.
You're working so hard to undermine him.

31:37.120 --> 31:40.000
Actually, I rather enjoy him.

31:40.090 --> 31:42.000
But he would see this country burn

31:42.130 --> 31:44.070
if he could be king of the ashes.

31:44.660 --> 31:46.610
You are a clever man, Lord Varys.

31:46.670 --> 31:51.170
You are too kind.
I believe I have a possible solution.

31:51.270 --> 31:54.410
One doesn't need to
be clever for that. It's obvious, isn't it?

32:06.420 --> 32:07.990
(CLEARS THROAT)

32:08.090 --> 32:09.360
I didn't mean to disturb you.

32:09.490 --> 32:10.830
You haven't.

32:11.760 --> 32:13.460
We'd like some privacy, please.

32:13.530 --> 32:16.470
If you wouldn't mind
waiting back inside the keep.

32:18.260 --> 32:20.040
Or if you'd be kind enough
to give me your names,

32:20.130 --> 32:22.840
I'll ask the King to
speak with you himself.

32:27.110 --> 32:28.680
What did you pray for?

32:28.770 --> 32:30.050
I can't tell you.

32:30.180 --> 32:31.480
Why not?

32:31.540 --> 32:34.110
I'll tell you
what I prayed for in the Sept this morning

32:34.180 --> 32:37.990
Let's see,
for my family's health and happiness,

32:38.050 --> 32:41.160
for an end to the war, for a short winter.

32:41.220 --> 32:44.790
Boring and traditional, I'm afraid.
And you?

32:44.860 --> 32:47.700
I'm sorry, I just can't.

32:47.790 --> 32:51.900
MARGAERY: My cousin Alanna
was the most beautiful girl I'd ever seen.

32:52.000 --> 32:54.170
When I was 12, I was all elbows and knees,

32:54.230 --> 32:56.580
and Manna
looked like a goddess sent to torture me.

32:56.670 --> 32:58.480
"Pig Face," she called me.

32:58.640 --> 33:00.380
(LAUGHS) “Pig Face"? That's ridiculous.

33:00.470 --> 33:02.540
It had something to do with my nose.

33:02.640 --> 33:05.590
Whenever she passed me
in the halls, she'd oink.

33:05.680 --> 33:07.180
- (OINKS)
- (LAUGHS)

33:08.150 --> 33:10.920
So I prayed that
she'd catch a horrible skin disease.

33:11.020 --> 33:13.520
A week after that,
she came down with porridge plague.

33:13.590 --> 33:14.690
Porridge plague?

33:14.820 --> 33:15.890
Oh: you don't have it in the North?

33:15.990 --> 33:18.400
Your" skin starts to look like boiled oats,

33:18.490 --> 33:21.270
and eventually,
your face slides off and you die in agony.

33:21.360 --> 33:23.170
But that's awful.

33:25.200 --> 33:26.230
(LAUGHS)

33:26.430 --> 33:27.910
You're...

33:28.000 --> 33:30.070
I believed you!

33:30.170 --> 33:31.740
Porridge plague. I'm an idiot.

33:31.840 --> 33:34.370
Don't say that. No, you're not.

33:34.440 --> 33:36.750
So what happened to Alanna?

33:36.840 --> 33:38.750
Oh, she grew up to be
the most beautiful woman

33:38.840 --> 33:41.850
and married a handsome
lord and they have darling children

33:41.910 --> 33:43.590
and live in a castle by the sea.

33:43.680 --> 33:45.390
It's all terribly frustrating.

33:46.350 --> 33:49.060
SANSA: I'm sure she's jealous of you now.

33:49.120 --> 33:51.360
You'll be married here in the capital,

33:51.420 --> 33:53.200
and shew have to come watch and

33:53.290 --> 33:55.030
pretend to be happy that you're queen.

33:55.090 --> 33:56.090
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

33:57.860 --> 34:01.310
I want us to be friends, good friends.

34:02.030 --> 34:03.710
That would make me very happy.

34:05.540 --> 34:09.449
You must see Highgarden.
You'd love it there. I know you would.

34:09.540 --> 34:12.449
We have a great
masquerade the night of the harvest moon.

34:12.540 --> 34:15.389
You should see the
costumes. People work on them for months.

34:17.320 --> 34:20.560
Uh. I don't think the Queen would
let me leave King's Landing.

34:20.620 --> 34:24.659
The Queen Regent you mean.
Once I marry Joffrey. I'll be queen.

34:26.730 --> 34:30.800
And if you were to marry Loras,

34:33.330 --> 34:36.969
your place would
be at Highgarden, wouldn't it?

34:38.170 --> 34:42.280
We would be sisters,
you and I. Would you like that?

34:56.590 --> 34:59.260
His name was Bannen.

34:59.320 --> 35:02.670
He was a good man, a good ranger.

35:02.760 --> 35:04.760
He came to us from...

35:06.430 --> 35:08.470
Where did he come from?

35:08.530 --> 35:10.310
Down White Harbor way.

35:11.440 --> 35:13.470
He came to us from White Harbor.

35:13.540 --> 35:16.520
Never failed in his duty.

35:16.610 --> 35:19.680
He kept ms vows the best he could.

35:19.780 --> 35:23.280
He rode far. fought fiercely.

35:25.780 --> 35:28.200
We shall never see his like again.

35:28.290 --> 35:31.290
ALL: And now his watch has ended.

35:32.960 --> 35:35.300
And now his watch has ended.

35:39.630 --> 35:42.870
Didn't think a broke foot could kill a man.

35:42.970 --> 35:45.880
It wasn't his foot that killed him.

35:45.970 --> 35:48.510
That bastard Craster starved him to death.

35:48.570 --> 35:50.140
Craster's got his daughters to feed.

35:50.310 --> 35:51.880
RAST: You on his side?

35:51.980 --> 35:55.250
We can't just show up
and steal all his food.

35:55.350 --> 35:57.550
We're brothers of
the Nights Watch not thieves

35:57.650 --> 36:03.260
The day we leave.
Craster will tap a barrel of our wine,

36:03.360 --> 36:06.390
and sit down to a feast of ham and potatoes

36:06.530 --> 36:09.600
and laugh at us starving in the snow.

36:13.500 --> 36:15.210
He's a bloody wildling.

36:18.000 --> 36:21.210
Never knew Bannen could smell so good.

36:31.750 --> 36:35.130
You have one son. don't you, Mormont?

36:36.720 --> 36:39.130
I had my 99th.

36:40.530 --> 36:43.300
You ever meet a man with 99 sons?

36:45.230 --> 36:48.640
And more daughters than I can count.

36:48.730 --> 36:49.870
I'm glad for you.

36:49.970 --> 36:51.070
Are you now?

36:51.140 --> 36:54.710
Me, I'll be glad when
you and yours have gone.

36:54.770 --> 36:56.810
As soon as our wounded are strong enough.

36:56.910 --> 36:57.910
Ah!

36:58.940 --> 37:00.890
They're as strong as they're gonna get.

37:02.910 --> 37:04.620
Them that's dying, why don't you

37:04.750 --> 37:06.460
out their throats and be done with it?

37:08.650 --> 37:13.260
Or leave them if you've not the
stomach, and I'll sort them myself.

37:13.330 --> 37:14.330
(CHUCKLES)

37:14.830 --> 37:17.400
KARL: Whose throat you gonna out, old man?

37:20.900 --> 37:22.310
Wait outside.

37:22.400 --> 37:25.570
It's cold outside and
there's nothing to eat.

37:25.640 --> 37:27.240
My wives gave you bread.

37:27.310 --> 37:28.910
There's sawdust in the bread.

37:30.510 --> 37:34.320
You don't like it,
you go out there and eat the snow.

37:39.480 --> 37:42.990
I'd rather eat what you've got hidden away.

37:45.260 --> 37:48.300
I told you to wait outside.

37:48.360 --> 37:51.770
He's sitting there drinking our
wine, eating his fill while we die.

37:53.000 --> 37:54.600
I gave you crows enough.

37:55.600 --> 37:56.770
I've got to feed my women!

37:56.840 --> 37:58.470
You admit you've got a hidden larder?

37:58.600 --> 38:00.280
How else you make it through winter?

38:00.340 --> 38:05.190
- Enough! Out!
- I am a godly man.

38:05.280 --> 38:06.620
You're a stingy bastard!

38:06.780 --> 38:08.160
Bastard?

38:08.210 --> 38:11.680
(GRUNTS) Out with you, you little thief.

38:11.780 --> 38:14.730
And you! And you!

38:16.860 --> 38:19.200
Go sleep in the cold on empty bellies.

38:21.790 --> 38:25.710
I'll chop the hands off
the next man who calls me bastard.

38:40.910 --> 38:42.410
You are a bastard.

38:45.320 --> 38:48.700
A daughter-fucking, wildling bastard.

38:49.320 --> 38:50.600
(YELLS)

38:55.330 --> 38:56.530
(WOMEN SCREAMING)

38:56.600 --> 38:58.600
MORMONT: The Gods will curse us for this.

38:58.700 --> 39:00.200
By all the laws...

39:00.330 --> 39:01.870
There are no laws beyond the Wall.

39:01.930 --> 39:04.780
Show us where he hides the food,
or you'll get the same as him.

39:05.700 --> 39:07.240
Unhand her.

39:08.110 --> 39:09.870
- I shall have your head for this.

40:01.460 --> 40:02.560
Quickly Quickly.

40:02.730 --> 40:03.800
GILLY: What's happening?

40:03.900 --> 40:05.500
I'm not going out there.

40:05.630 --> 40:07.270
No, we have to go. Now!

40:07.330 --> 40:08.330
(BABY CRYING)

40:12.740 --> 40:14.940
GILLY: Follow me. I know the best way.

40:16.910 --> 40:18.680
Come on.

40:24.450 --> 40:28.660
Run fast, Piggy, and sleep well!

40:28.750 --> 40:31.500
I'll be cutting your throat
one of these nights.

40:36.930 --> 40:38.430
ARYA: Can I take this hood off yet?

40:38.500 --> 40:39.800
THOROS: I do apologize little lady,

40:39.860 --> 40:42.870
but it's better for you
if you don't see where we're going.

40:43.000 --> 40:44.210
(HORSE NEIGHING)

40:48.440 --> 40:49.780
MAN: Halt!

40:56.110 --> 40:58.360
- What is it?
- Blackstrap rum.

40:58.880 --> 40:59.880
Ugh!

41:01.120 --> 41:03.360
Not easy finding molasses in wartime.

41:03.460 --> 41:05.130
GENDRY: I'd have some.

41:08.790 --> 41:09.830
Let's go home.

41:27.310 --> 41:28.990
GENDRY: What is this place?

41:29.050 --> 41:32.030
Somewhere neither wolves
nor lions come prowling.

41:41.160 --> 41:43.900
You look like a bunch of swineherds.

41:44.000 --> 41:46.000
ANGUY: Some of us were swineherds.

41:46.060 --> 41:50.040
And some of us
tanners and masons. That was before.

41:50.100 --> 41:55.070
You're still swineherds
and tanners and masons.

41:55.170 --> 41:58.020
You think carrying a crooked
spear makes you a soldier?

41:58.080 --> 41:59.080
MAN: No.

42:01.380 --> 42:04.590
Fighting in a war makes you a soldier.

42:04.680 --> 42:06.750
Beric Dondarrion?

42:06.850 --> 42:08.690
You've seen better days.

42:08.850 --> 42:10.700
And I won't see them again.

42:12.460 --> 42:17.030
Stark deserters. Baratheon deserters.

42:17.100 --> 42:20.080
You lot aren't
fighting in a war, you're running from it.

42:20.130 --> 42:22.410
Last I heard,
you were King Jeffrey's guard dog.

42:22.470 --> 42:28.110
But here you are 1 000 miles from
home. Which of us is running?

42:28.210 --> 42:30.240
Untie these ropes and we'll find out.

42:30.310 --> 42:33.920
What are you doing
leading a mob of peasants?

42:33.980 --> 42:38.090
Ned Stark ordered me to execute your
brother in King Robert's name.

42:38.150 --> 42:40.560
Ned Stark is dead

42:40.620 --> 42:42.830
King Robert is dead.

42:42.920 --> 42:44.990
My brother's alive.

42:45.390 --> 42:46.600
(SPITS)

42:47.490 --> 42:49.300
You're fighting for ghosts.

42:49.390 --> 42:54.470
That's what we are,
ghosts waiting for you in the dark.

42:55.570 --> 42:59.480
You can't see us, but we see you.

42:59.570 --> 43:04.610
No matter whose cloak
you wear, Lannister, Stark, Baratheon,

43:04.680 --> 43:06.620
you prey on the weak,

43:06.680 --> 43:09.320
the Brotherhood
Without Banners will hunt you down.

43:09.410 --> 43:11.490
You found god? Is that it?

43:11.580 --> 43:13.030
Aye.

43:13.120 --> 43:15.860
I've been reborn
in the light of the one true god.

43:16.990 --> 43:18.590
As have we all.

43:18.660 --> 43:21.260
As would any man
who's seen the things we've seen.

43:21.330 --> 43:23.930
If you mean to murder
me then get on with it.

43:24.000 --> 43:27.030
You'll die soon enough, dog.

43:27.130 --> 43:30.600
But it won't be murder, only justice.

43:30.670 --> 43:34.140
ANGUY: And a kinder fate than you deserve.
Lions, you call yourselves.

43:34.210 --> 43:37.450
At the Mummer's Ford,
girls of seven years were raped,

43:37.510 --> 43:41.390
and babes still on the breast were out
in two while their mothers watched.

43:41.480 --> 43:43.520
I wasn't at the Mummer's Ford.

43:43.620 --> 43:46.120
Dump your dead children at some other door.

43:46.180 --> 43:48.560
House Clegane was built upon dead children.

43:48.650 --> 43:52.690
I saw them lay Prince Aegon and Princess
Rhaenys before the Iron Throne.

43:52.790 --> 43:56.900
Do you take me for
my brother? ls being born Clegane a crime?

43:57.000 --> 43:58.500
Murder is a crime.

43:58.630 --> 44:00.130
I never touched the Targaryen babes.

44:00.200 --> 44:04.840
I never saw them never smelled
them, never heard them bawling.

44:04.900 --> 44:08.540
You want to cut my throat, get on with it!

44:08.640 --> 44:12.420
But don't call me murderer
and pretend that you're not.

44:12.510 --> 44:13.720
You murdered Mycah.

44:14.650 --> 44:18.030
The butcher's boy. My friend.

44:18.080 --> 44:22.900
He was 12 years old.
He was unarmed And you rode mm down

44:22.990 --> 44:25.430
You slung him
over your horse like he was some deer.

44:25.520 --> 44:28.000
Aye, he was a bleeder.

44:29.360 --> 44:30.860
You don't deny killing this boy?

HOUND: I was Jeffrey's sworn shield.

44:32.560 --> 44:34.440
- The boy attacked the prince.
- That's a lie!

44:34.530 --> 44:37.910
I hit Jeffrey. Mycah just ran away.

44:38.000 --> 44:41.850
Then I should have killed you. Not
my place to question princes.

44:44.280 --> 44:46.380
You stand accused of murder.

44:46.440 --> 44:48.690
But no one here knows the truth

44:48.780 --> 44:51.020
of the charge, so it is
not for us to judge you.

44:51.080 --> 44:53.790
Only the Lord of Light may do that now.

44:55.890 --> 44:58.460
I sentence you to trial by combat.

45:00.590 --> 45:03.040
So, who will it be?

45:04.030 --> 45:08.440
Should we find out
if your fire god really loves you: priest?

45:08.530 --> 45:11.880
Or you, archer? What are you
worth with a sword in your hand?

45:13.100 --> 45:15.740
Or is the little girl the bravest one here?

45:18.310 --> 45:19.480
Aye.

45:20.550 --> 45:22.290
She might be.

He says you would be wise
to blood them early.

45:58.850 --> 46:00.590
There are many small cities between

46:00.750 --> 46:02.460
here and there, cities ripe for sacking.

46:05.590 --> 46:07.590
Should you take captives, the masters will

46:07.690 --> 46:09.690
buy the healthy ones and for a good price.

46:14.630 --> 46:16.510
And who knows?

46:17.500 --> 46:19.780
In 10 years some of the boys you send them

46:19.940 --> 46:22.180
