01:24.000 --> 01:25.502
Yeah, betting on
the eastern bank paid off.

01:25.502 --> 01:27.462
Fish are running strong
out there.

01:27.462 --> 01:29.255
Time and tide
wait for no man.

01:29.255 --> 01:30.757
That is why
you gotta keep up with me.

01:31.966 --> 01:33.510
Spoken like a true Plimsoll.

01:33.510 --> 01:36.262
Someday, you're gonna make
a fine skipper.

01:36.262 --> 01:37.639
I don't see you
going anywhere, Captain.

01:39.224 --> 01:40.517
Can't do this forever.

02:04.374 --> 02:05.250
Hello?

02:05.250 --> 02:06.209
Hey, Shutterbot?

02:06.209 --> 02:08.294
Hi, Janice.

02:08.294 --> 02:10.130
Guess who just sat down
for brunch at La Reina,

02:10.130 --> 02:11.840
and not with his wife?

02:11.840 --> 02:13.008
Who?

02:13.008 --> 02:14.467
You're not gonna guess?

02:14.467 --> 02:15.510
<i>No.</i>

02:15.510 --> 02:16.720
<i>Who is it?</i>

02:16.720 --> 02:17.637
Just get down here.

02:17.637 --> 02:18.722
It's big.

02:18.722 --> 02:19.764
I'm on my way.

02:24.185 --> 02:25.895
Not today, little buddy.

02:46.249 --> 02:47.876
I can't wait
to get back out there again.

02:47.876 --> 02:49.336
- You and me both.
- Freedom.

02:49.336 --> 02:51.087
The open seas.
Nothing like it.

02:51.087 --> 02:52.172
I gotta be honest,

02:52.172 --> 02:53.298
it would be nice

02:53.298 --> 02:54.716
to not constantly
smell so fishy.

02:55.884 --> 02:57.010
Well, it's better than

02:57.010 --> 02:58.053
being cooped up
in an office somewhere

02:58.053 --> 02:59.929
like a parakeet
in a plastic cage.

02:59.929 --> 03:00.930
I don't know how people do it.

03:02.724 --> 03:03.850
I used to be
one of those people, remember?

03:03.850 --> 03:05.352
So you know.

03:06.561 --> 03:08.146
It ain't so bad
smelling like a fish.

03:08.146 --> 03:09.439
Ain't that the truth?

03:15.195 --> 03:17.322
All right, so...

03:17.322 --> 03:18.907
what's the big deal?

03:18.907 --> 03:20.533
Right over there.

03:20.533 --> 03:22.452
Big as life.

03:24.162 --> 03:27.040
Well, if it isn't
our beloved bad boy

03:27.040 --> 03:28.458
who just lost a record deal.

03:29.542 --> 03:32.045
You think his wife knows?

03:32.045 --> 03:33.797
I doubt it.

03:33.797 --> 03:34.923
She's probably at home
painting the nursery.

03:36.299 --> 03:37.717
Some guys...

03:37.717 --> 03:39.010
I know.

03:51.815 --> 03:52.899
Hey, Shutterbot.

03:52.899 --> 03:54.234
How's it going?

03:54.234 --> 03:56.319
Great.
Until you showed up.

03:56.319 --> 03:58.196
Oh, I didn't know
this was by invitation only.

03:58.196 --> 03:59.823
I'll be sure
to get out of your hair, okay?

03:59.823 --> 04:00.949
That'd be wonderful.

04:04.953 --> 04:06.371
Always a pleasure, Jaypeg.

04:06.371 --> 04:07.414
Pleasure's all yours.

04:10.000 --> 04:11.793
For your vital contribution
to photo journalism.

04:13.628 --> 04:15.505
The scandal-loving population
thanks ya.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.299
I do what I can.

04:18.299 --> 04:19.801
Bye, Jaypeg.

04:24.139 --> 04:25.432
Freddy!

04:25.432 --> 04:26.933
Make sure when it's time
to roll up the nets,

04:26.933 --> 04:28.101
you keep them straight,

04:28.101 --> 04:29.310
otherwise
they're gonna pinch and bind.

04:29.310 --> 04:30.979
That's bad, right?

04:32.313 --> 04:33.606
Let's just say whoever did that

04:33.606 --> 04:34.816
should remember that
there are sharks out there.

04:41.239 --> 04:43.283
<i>So how long you figure
you're gonna be laid up?</i>

04:43.283 --> 04:46.327
Well, doctor says weeks,
but I'm really okay.

04:47.412 --> 04:48.621
At least that gives us

04:48.621 --> 04:50.123
some time to arrange
someone to be with you.

04:50.123 --> 04:52.042
Look, I'm fine.
Don't worry about me.

04:54.669 --> 04:56.129
Oh-- Mark?

04:56.129 --> 04:57.339
Goodness sakes,
I'll call you tomorrow.

04:59.841 --> 05:00.717
Oh...

05:02.302 --> 05:04.012
What's up?

05:04.012 --> 05:05.430
Your Aunt Dody.

05:05.430 --> 05:08.141
Seems she was out
walking Goldie...

05:08.141 --> 05:09.642
took a spill.

05:09.642 --> 05:10.810
Is she okay?

05:10.810 --> 05:12.937
Well, she's nursing
a compound fracture,

05:12.937 --> 05:14.731
and that's gonna take some time
to knit back together.

05:17.567 --> 05:18.985
She's gonna need someone
to look after her.

05:18.985 --> 05:22.614
I-- I don't think
I know anyone in L.A. anymore.

05:22.614 --> 05:23.823
Well, there's gotta be agencies

05:23.823 --> 05:24.991
that take care of
that kind of thing, right?

05:24.991 --> 05:26.451
I.. I'll make some calls tomorrow.

05:26.451 --> 05:27.744
We'll find someone,
don't worry.

05:30.747 --> 05:31.623
What about you?

05:32.832 --> 05:34.709
Me?

05:34.709 --> 05:35.794
Dad, have you forgotten about

05:35.794 --> 05:37.003
what happened
when I moved to L.A.?

05:38.046 --> 05:39.464
I actually thought

05:39.464 --> 05:41.257
I could flash my degree
in environmental studies,

05:41.257 --> 05:42.884
join a high-powered
watchdog group,

05:42.884 --> 05:45.136
and then change the world.

05:45.136 --> 05:46.680
Little did I know

05:46.680 --> 05:48.473
I'd end up feeling like
a tiny fish in a gigantic pond.

05:48.473 --> 05:50.392
Ah. Well, no shame in that.

05:50.392 --> 05:52.227
You were young.
You had stars in your eyes.

05:52.227 --> 05:54.187
But...

05:54.187 --> 05:55.355
maybe it's time
to get back out there

05:55.355 --> 05:56.398
and see
what you've been missing.

05:57.482 --> 05:58.733
You think
I'm missing something?

06:00.151 --> 06:01.361
No harm in finding out.

06:01.361 --> 06:02.737
That's true.

06:04.280 --> 06:06.491
Besides, someone definitely
has to keep an eye on Aunt Dody.

06:06.491 --> 06:07.992
Who better than me?
I mean, I'm family.

06:07.992 --> 06:09.160
Right?

06:09.160 --> 06:11.413
And maybe you're right.

06:11.413 --> 06:12.580
Maybe it is time
for me to get back out there.

06:12.580 --> 06:14.374
That's the Plimsoll spirit!

06:14.374 --> 06:16.209
Your mother would be proud.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.545
But I am not saying
that I will stay.

06:18.545 --> 06:19.921
If it turns out you're wrong,

06:19.921 --> 06:21.214
I'm getting right back
on that boat where I belong.

06:21.214 --> 06:22.924
And we would be happy
to have you back.

06:25.010 --> 06:26.386
Cheers to that.

06:26.386 --> 06:27.679
- Thank you.
- L.A., baby.

06:30.890 --> 06:31.933
Are you sure

06:31.933 --> 06:32.892
you're gonna be
okay while I'm gone?

06:32.892 --> 06:34.019
Don't worry about me.

06:34.019 --> 06:35.729
You're the one
that needs to be careful.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.397
Those people drive like maniacs
down there.

06:37.397 --> 06:39.107
Yes, Dad, I will be careful.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.486
And you...

06:43.486 --> 06:45.530
tell the crew to go easy
on my fishing nets.

06:45.530 --> 06:47.907
Roll 'em straight on the drum
like I showed 'em.

06:47.907 --> 06:48.742
I will.

06:48.742 --> 06:50.577
Okay.

06:50.577 --> 06:51.911
I should go,
it's a long drive.

06:51.911 --> 06:53.121
All right.

06:58.793 --> 06:59.878
I love you!

06:59.878 --> 07:00.837
I love you.

07:03.381 --> 07:04.758
Hey, Beth!

07:04.758 --> 07:06.384
How do you know
if a guy's a real fisherman?

07:06.384 --> 07:08.553
He leaves his calling cod.

07:08.553 --> 07:10.013
But never on porpoise.

07:10.013 --> 07:11.139
Bye!

07:31.826 --> 07:33.078
Celebrity news.

07:33.078 --> 07:33.953
You mean gossip?

07:33.953 --> 07:35.288
Oh, no.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.623
Gossip's a bad word
around here.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.625
We prefer to think of it
as "celebrity profiles".

07:38.625 --> 07:39.834
Hey, how are you coming

07:39.834 --> 07:41.461
on that "Springtime
in the City" issue?

07:41.461 --> 07:43.380
Flowers are blooming.
Birds are chirping.

07:43.380 --> 07:45.006
If there's any romance
left in this ol' town,

07:45.006 --> 07:46.633
we'll find it.

07:46.633 --> 07:49.469
Hey, how about we do a piece
on that farmers' market on 3rd?

07:49.469 --> 07:50.929
Pretty people out and about.

07:50.929 --> 07:52.847
Yeah, pawing through
all that fresh produce?

07:52.847 --> 07:54.140
Sounds pretty romantic to me.

07:54.140 --> 07:55.183
I love it.

07:56.726 --> 07:58.019

08:06.444 --> 08:07.362

08:07.362 --> 08:08.655
Mm-mm.

08:08.655 --> 08:10.365
Just getting started?

08:10.365 --> 08:11.866
Been working since breakfast.

08:11.866 --> 08:13.451
The real eyes and ears
of the city.

08:13.451 --> 08:15.120
Oh, kitty up a tree?

08:15.120 --> 08:17.372
Oh, that's rich.

08:17.372 --> 08:18.456
Coming from the feature editor

08:18.456 --> 08:19.833
of a publication that runs

08:19.833 --> 08:22.168
such serious journalistic items

08:22.168 --> 08:23.670
as...

08:23.670 --> 08:25.046
"Celebrity Pet Diets".

08:25.046 --> 08:26.506
Very nice.

08:26.506 --> 08:27.674
I wonder what that's about.

08:27.674 --> 08:28.842
What do you got for me?

08:28.842 --> 08:31.011
Please tell me
it's an actual assignment?

08:31.011 --> 08:32.387
Yep.

08:32.387 --> 08:33.972
An actual assignment.

08:33.972 --> 08:35.015

08:38.184 --> 08:39.728

Farmers' Market.

08:39.728 --> 08:42.147
Thinks it's very romantic.

08:42.147 --> 08:44.399
It's a modern-day Green Acres.

08:44.399 --> 08:45.692
When do you need it by?

08:45.692 --> 08:46.735
Can you have something for me
by Thursday?

08:46.735 --> 08:48.903
For you?

08:48.903 --> 08:50.071
Anything.

08:50.071 --> 08:51.698
That's yours.

08:51.698 --> 08:52.949
Oh.

08:52.949 --> 08:53.950
Thank you.

08:59.748 --> 09:00.915
Wow!

09:00.915 --> 09:02.876
Ah-hah!

09:02.876 --> 09:04.419
Oh, I am so glad
you came to visit,

09:04.419 --> 09:06.588
you're a tremendous help.

09:06.588 --> 09:09.049
Well, somebody has to
keep you out of trouble.

09:09.049 --> 09:10.300
Ha-hah!

09:10.300 --> 09:12.344
Darling, grab
one of those boxes.

09:12.344 --> 09:15.013
Okay, let's see...

09:15.013 --> 09:18.391
Now, we'll grab
a couple of Cattleya...

09:18.391 --> 09:20.268
a Vanda, or two.

09:21.770 --> 09:23.563
Here's a nice one.

09:23.563 --> 09:24.898
Oh, those yellow ones
are gorgeous.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.232
What are they?

09:26.232 --> 09:27.400
Oncidium...

09:27.400 --> 09:29.110
dancing-lady orchids.

09:29.110 --> 09:30.236
They're my biggest seller.

09:30.236 --> 09:32.238
So much personality.

09:32.238 --> 09:33.573
Huh.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.241
That's funny,
that reminds me of someone.

09:38.620 --> 09:40.121
Okay, now, let's see.

09:40.121 --> 09:41.122
What else would Hiro like?

09:42.624 --> 09:44.793
Have you always liked orchids?

09:44.793 --> 09:46.002
Well, I started
with African violets,

09:46.002 --> 09:47.420
but I got bored.

09:47.420 --> 09:48.672
And then I graduated
to anthurium,

09:48.672 --> 09:50.382
but they were persnickety.

09:50.382 --> 09:51.508
Hmm.

09:51.508 --> 09:53.718
And then, I discovered orchids.

09:53.718 --> 09:55.261
And what makes them so special?

09:56.888 --> 09:58.598
Well, they're like
little people...

09:58.598 --> 09:59.766
with faces.

09:59.766 --> 10:00.809
Don't pansies have faces?

10:00.809 --> 10:02.143
Ah, see, now that's different.

10:02.143 --> 10:03.853
Now, a pansy face
can just smile at you,

10:03.853 --> 10:05.939
but an orchid face...

10:05.939 --> 10:07.857
well, it's like a person
wearing a costume.

10:07.857 --> 10:09.109
Kind of like a kabuki mask.

10:09.109 --> 10:10.235
Cute.

10:12.070 --> 10:13.613
I'm so grateful
you're here, Beth.

10:13.613 --> 10:14.364
And not just for the help.

10:15.782 --> 10:17.200
To be honest,

10:17.200 --> 10:18.660
I was a little surprised

10:18.660 --> 10:20.745
when I heard
that you were coming back here.

10:20.745 --> 10:22.038
I didn't think
you much cared for L.A...

10:23.373 --> 10:25.333
Well, wasn't just the city,

10:25.333 --> 10:26.126
there was other stuff, too.

10:27.335 --> 10:28.378
I know.

10:28.378 --> 10:30.296
That boy broke your heart.

10:30.296 --> 10:32.090
Nearly broke my heart.

10:32.090 --> 10:35.176
Yeah. Good ol' Captain Dad
to the rescue.

10:35.176 --> 10:36.886
I needed to go home,

10:36.886 --> 10:39.681
and he needed another hand
on the "Maria Elizabeth".

10:39.681 --> 10:41.016
It was only supposed to be
for a season,

10:41.016 --> 10:43.184
but, once I got there, it just--

10:43.184 --> 10:44.936
it felt like it was
exactly where I was...

10:44.936 --> 10:46.438
I was meant to be.
You know?

10:46.438 --> 10:48.064
Hmm.

10:48.064 --> 10:49.107
And you've been there
ever since.

10:49.107 --> 10:50.066
- Mm-hmm.
- Okay.

10:50.066 --> 10:52.944
Oh! There we go.

10:52.944 --> 10:54.779
All right, that should do it.

10:54.779 --> 10:56.031
- Okay.
- All right.

11:48.333 --> 11:50.377
It's so cute in here!

11:50.377 --> 11:51.670
Isn't it lovely?

11:51.670 --> 11:53.088
Hiro's my best customer.

11:53.088 --> 11:55.840
All right, so besides orchids,
what's your favorite?

11:55.840 --> 11:57.300
Ooh, that's easy, foxgloves.

11:57.300 --> 11:59.344
Your grandmother
always planted foxgloves.

11:59.344 --> 12:00.553
What's your favorite?

12:00.553 --> 12:02.931
Roses...

12:02.931 --> 12:04.140
red, long-stemmed roses.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.520
Those were
your mother's favorite, too.

12:08.520 --> 12:10.146
Hmm, like mother like daughter.

12:11.231 --> 12:12.524
Good morning, Hiro!

12:12.524 --> 12:14.025
Oh, good morning, Dody.

12:14.025 --> 12:15.527
I brought you
some dancing ladies.

12:15.527 --> 12:16.945
Oh, no.

12:16.945 --> 12:18.154
Don't tell my wife.

12:20.031 --> 12:21.491
Enjoy.

12:21.491 --> 12:23.618
Hey, I got a new shipment
of flowers, just came in.

12:23.618 --> 12:24.869
I think you're gonna love them.

12:24.869 --> 12:26.496
Don't tease me.

13:14.753 --> 13:15.962
Okay...

13:39.903 --> 13:41.071
There she is...

13:43.698 --> 13:45.450
...in all of her candid glory.

13:51.706 --> 13:53.500
The Flower Girl.

13:59.964 --> 14:02.801
Shutterbot.

14:02.801 --> 14:04.010
3rd Street Market.

14:05.887 --> 14:06.888
All right, what are we taking?

14:06.888 --> 14:09.641
We're taking...

14:09.641 --> 14:11.351
this...

14:11.351 --> 14:13.353
that...

14:13.353 --> 14:14.479
and this one, this one.

14:15.689 --> 14:16.398
Oh, that's good.

14:19.818 --> 14:21.277
I'll take that.

14:23.780 --> 14:25.407
Great.

14:25.407 --> 14:26.408
Done.

14:29.452 --> 14:30.578
So, how's the catch?

14:30.578 --> 14:32.247
<i>Oh, pretty good.</i>

14:32.247 --> 14:33.707
Coming back full.

14:33.707 --> 14:35.083
Well, most runs, anyway.

14:35.083 --> 14:36.292
Nice.

14:36.292 --> 14:37.377
And the crew?

14:37.377 --> 14:38.920
<i>Oh, they're all right.</i>

14:38.920 --> 14:40.213
<i>They miss you.</i>

14:40.213 --> 14:41.881
And they hate the new cook.

14:41.881 --> 14:43.925
They say he burns the coffee.

14:43.925 --> 14:45.260
What do you mean?
Who's the new cook?

14:46.428 --> 14:47.387
Me.

14:47.387 --> 14:48.972
Right.

14:49.973 --> 14:51.474
<i>So, how's Dody?</i>

14:51.474 --> 14:53.143
Yeah, she's okay.

14:53.143 --> 14:55.228
It certainly hasn't,
uh, put a damper on her spirits,

14:55.228 --> 14:56.938
I will say that.

14:56.938 --> 14:58.732
I don't know. I just--
I think she's moving slow,

14:58.732 --> 14:59.899
it's a little frustrating
for her.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.693
So what's the doctor say?

15:01.693 --> 15:03.111
He said that as soon as

15:03.111 --> 15:04.362
she can handle the steps
on her own,

15:04.362 --> 15:05.405
I can come home.

15:05.405 --> 15:06.781
Probably, like,

15:06.781 --> 15:08.408
<i>two weeks from now,
she'll be as good as new.</i>

15:08.408 --> 15:09.659
All right.

15:09.659 --> 15:10.785
Well, the crew
wants you back.

15:10.785 --> 15:11.745
They're threatening
a mutiny, so...

15:11.745 --> 15:13.038
Aww.

15:13.038 --> 15:13.913
Well, tell them
I miss them, too.

15:13.913 --> 15:15.373
All right.

15:15.373 --> 15:16.833
<i>- I love you.
-</i> I love you, too, sweetheart.

15:16.833 --> 15:18.209
Bye, Dad.

15:22.213 --> 15:23.423
I got your folder.

15:23.423 --> 15:25.091
I hope there's
some good stuff in there.

15:25.091 --> 15:27.510
Yeah, I think
you'll be happy.

15:27.510 --> 15:29.387
I actually had fun
on this assignment.

15:29.387 --> 15:30.889
Oh.

15:30.889 --> 15:33.141
Speaking of fun assignments,
I need you to do me a favor.

15:33.141 --> 15:34.267
Sure.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.810
I'm at a conference
this afternoon.

15:35.810 --> 15:37.312
Would you check in on Princess?

15:37.312 --> 15:39.105
Stop by, take her for a walk?

15:39.105 --> 15:40.732
There's a dog park
at the end of the street.

15:40.732 --> 15:42.108
Sure. Yeah, absolutely.

15:42.108 --> 15:43.651
I don't think I've met Princess.

15:43.651 --> 15:45.278
She's a cutie, you'll love her.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.571
I'll leave a key
with the doorman.

15:46.571 --> 15:47.822
Great.

15:47.822 --> 15:49.741
Well, let's get you paid.

15:49.741 --> 15:50.658
Thank you, ma'am.

15:52.410 --> 15:54.204
Come on, Goldie.
Come here!

15:54.204 --> 15:55.288
Let me see.
Bring your ball.

15:55.288 --> 15:56.456
Good girl.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.041
So smart, Goldie!

15:58.041 --> 15:59.626
You ready?
Gonna go again. Go!

15:59.626 --> 16:01.002
Go! Get your ball!

16:02.212 --> 16:03.380
All right, little girl,

16:03.380 --> 16:04.297
let's see if you've got
some legs on ya.

16:04.297 --> 16:05.590
I'm gonna keep your leash on,

16:05.590 --> 16:06.716
but I'm gonna let you go,

16:06.716 --> 16:07.509
'cause I don't know you
that well.

16:07.509 --> 16:08.802
You ready?

16:08.802 --> 16:10.136
There you go, get it.

16:14.933 --> 16:15.975
Okay...

16:15.975 --> 16:18.353
Good girl. Good girl!

16:18.353 --> 16:19.396
You ready?
This is a big one!

16:19.396 --> 16:20.355
And... go!

16:20.355 --> 16:21.356
Oh, no!

16:24.067 --> 16:25.777
Sorry!
Sorry, sorry.

16:25.777 --> 16:27.195
I wasn't looking.

16:27.195 --> 16:28.780
Um...

16:30.281 --> 16:31.616
Oh, hi!

16:31.616 --> 16:32.784
Excuse me.

16:32.784 --> 16:34.744
Who's this?

16:34.744 --> 16:36.663
Is this a French bulldog?

16:36.663 --> 16:38.373
I... I don't know what that is.

16:38.373 --> 16:39.124
That's a...

16:39.124 --> 16:40.750
I really don't know.

16:40.750 --> 16:41.835
But her name is Princess.

16:41.835 --> 16:43.294
Oh, she's cute.

16:43.294 --> 16:44.713
Uh, she belongs
to my friend of mine.

16:44.713 --> 16:45.714
I just took her for a walk,

16:45.714 --> 16:46.840
'cause my friend's
at a conference.

16:46.840 --> 16:48.383
I love all breeds of dogs.

16:48.383 --> 16:49.801
Back home, it's, like,
there's Labradors,

16:49.801 --> 16:50.802
Golden Retrievers,

16:50.802 --> 16:52.303
German Shepherds.

16:52.303 --> 16:53.388
That's about as exciting
as it gets.

16:54.597 --> 16:55.682
Where's back home?

16:55.682 --> 16:57.642
James Harbor, Washington.

16:57.642 --> 16:58.560
Okay.

17:00.186 --> 17:01.187
I'm Beth, by the way.

17:01.187 --> 17:02.272
- I'm Jake.
- Jake.

17:02.272 --> 17:03.565
- I'm sorry.
- I'm sorry.

17:03.565 --> 17:04.733
- Yep.
- Hi.

17:04.733 --> 17:05.692
- Nice to meet ya.
- Nice to meet you, too.

17:06.901 --> 17:08.403
Goldie, take that
out of your mouth!

17:12.824 --> 17:13.908
Don't be ashamed
if the ball isn't your thing,

17:13.908 --> 17:15.410
it's okay.

17:19.873 --> 17:21.499
Goldie!

17:21.499 --> 17:22.876
Goldie... Goldie!

17:22.876 --> 17:24.294
Come here!

17:24.294 --> 17:26.421
Oh, yeah.

17:26.421 --> 17:27.505
Goldie...

17:27.505 --> 17:29.007
What are you doing?

17:29.007 --> 17:29.966
This is--
Sorry, again.

17:29.966 --> 17:31.968
- Goldie?
- Yeah, this is Goldie.

17:31.968 --> 17:33.303
Oh, good.

17:33.303 --> 17:34.721
I think she likes
you and Princess.

17:34.721 --> 17:35.680
- Yeah.
- Come here, girl.

17:35.680 --> 17:37.140
She's trouble.

17:37.140 --> 17:38.141
How are you doing?

17:38.141 --> 17:40.018
So what brings you

17:40.018 --> 17:42.687
to our, uh,
little, sun-drenched paradise?

17:42.687 --> 17:44.314
Oh, my aunt, actually.

17:44.314 --> 17:45.607
Yeah, she fell
and broke her leg.

17:45.607 --> 17:46.691
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:46.691 --> 17:47.817
Oh, no, no, totally fine.

17:47.817 --> 17:48.902
I just need to be here

17:48.902 --> 17:49.944
to look after her
for a few weeks.

17:49.944 --> 17:50.987
Okay.

17:50.987 --> 17:52.364
And after that?

17:52.364 --> 17:53.615
Right back to working
on my dad's fishing boat.

17:54.949 --> 17:56.368
You work on a fishing boat?

17:56.368 --> 17:57.410
I do, yes.

17:57.410 --> 17:58.286
Wow.

17:58.286 --> 17:59.412
The "Maria Elizabeth".

17:59.412 --> 18:00.580
She is gorgeous.

18:00.580 --> 18:02.123
Wow.

18:03.166 --> 18:04.125
What about you?

18:04.125 --> 18:05.085
You, uh...

18:05.085 --> 18:06.378
What do you do for work?

18:06.378 --> 18:07.629
I'm a freelance photographer.

18:09.172 --> 18:10.840
Are you one of those guys

18:10.840 --> 18:12.509
that, like, hides in the bushes
to take photos of famous people?

18:13.885 --> 18:15.136
Uh, hmm...

18:15.136 --> 18:17.055
No, I do, um...

18:17.055 --> 18:17.931
news features.

18:17.931 --> 18:19.391
Oh!

18:19.391 --> 18:20.433
Yeah. Like,
human-interest stories.

18:20.433 --> 18:21.518
Yeah.

18:21.518 --> 18:22.560
The kid that grew
the biggest pumpkin,

18:22.560 --> 18:23.436
that kind of thing.

18:23.436 --> 18:24.604
- Cool, I love that.
- Thanks.

18:24.604 --> 18:25.855
Way better than
those guys I see on TV.

18:25.855 --> 18:27.107
Much.

18:27.107 --> 18:28.024
Yeah, there's
a lot of them here.

18:28.024 --> 18:29.192
Mm.

18:29.192 --> 18:30.443
What do you think of L.A.?

18:30.443 --> 18:32.070
Oh, it's not my first time.

18:32.070 --> 18:32.946
Yeah, I used to live here.

18:32.946 --> 18:34.364
Okay.

18:34.364 --> 18:36.950
Unfortunately, I haven't
been able to get out much.

18:36.950 --> 18:38.827
I can't be away
from Aunt Dody too long.

18:38.827 --> 18:39.744
Oh, right, 'cause of her leg.

18:39.744 --> 18:40.870
Exactly.

18:40.870 --> 18:43.123
I can borrow her bike.

18:43.123 --> 18:45.125
- Oh, you ride?
- Yeah. Yeah.

18:45.125 --> 18:46.584
I love riding.
Where do you ride?

18:46.584 --> 18:47.961
San Vicente.

18:47.961 --> 18:49.671
I love San Vicente.
We should go riding sometime.

18:49.671 --> 18:50.547
I'd love that.

18:53.299 --> 18:54.759
Yeah. Maybe sometime, yeah.

18:57.303 --> 18:58.304
Tomorrow-- that's...

18:58.304 --> 18:59.389
that's sometime, right?

19:01.057 --> 19:02.684
It depends on my aunt.

19:03.935 --> 19:04.978
Of course. Of course.

19:04.978 --> 19:06.312
Yeah, I get it.

19:06.312 --> 19:08.648
Strange guy in a dog park

19:08.648 --> 19:10.191
with an even
stranger-looking dog.

19:10.191 --> 19:11.401
I get it.
It's a lot.

19:11.401 --> 19:12.777
You can never be
too careful.

19:14.696 --> 19:16.656
No offense, Jake, but...

19:16.656 --> 19:17.699
I have wrestled

19:17.699 --> 19:19.659
a few 80-pound salmon
to the dock.

19:19.659 --> 19:20.660
Okay.

19:20.660 --> 19:21.745
After doing that,

19:21.745 --> 19:22.579
you and Princess
don't seem too scary.

19:22.579 --> 19:23.872
Good. Good.

19:25.790 --> 19:26.708
Is that a yes?

19:29.586 --> 19:30.670
It's a yes.

19:31.838 --> 19:33.048
Great.

19:33.048 --> 19:34.716
San Vicente tomorrow.

19:34.716 --> 19:35.800
What time?

19:35.800 --> 19:37.218
1:30.

19:37.218 --> 19:39.179
I'll meet you at, uh...

19:39.179 --> 19:40.472
Third Street and San Vicente.

19:43.183 --> 19:44.726
- Bye, Jake.
- Okay, bye.

19:44.726 --> 19:45.935
Come on, Goldie.

19:45.935 --> 19:47.312
- Good girl, come on.
- Bye, Goldie.

19:47.312 --> 19:49.105
Goldie, come on,
we're gonna go this way.

19:49.105 --> 19:50.440
- I'm telling you, this dog...
- I know.

19:50.440 --> 19:52.650
Goldie. Goldie. Goldie.

19:52.650 --> 19:53.860
I'm very sorry.

19:53.860 --> 19:54.861
She wants to stay with you.

19:54.861 --> 19:55.820
- That's okay.
- Goldie.

19:55.820 --> 19:56.821
We can stay together.

19:56.821 --> 19:57.947
Come on, Goldie.

19:57.947 --> 19:59.366
We can live
a life together, Goldie.

19:59.366 --> 20:01.368
Let's go this way.
Goldie, come on. Good girl.

20:01.368 --> 20:02.869
Bye! Bye, Princess.

20:02.869 --> 20:04.371
Bye, Beth.
I'll see you later.

20:04.371 --> 20:05.413
Bye.

20:05.413 --> 20:06.623
Bye, Princess!
Goldie...

20:17.676 --> 20:19.344
So...

20:19.344 --> 20:20.679
I've done a little bit
of internet research.

20:20.679 --> 20:22.055
Ooh!

20:22.055 --> 20:23.473
And I've prepared
a few questions.

20:23.473 --> 20:25.684
All right, what you got?

20:25.684 --> 20:27.394
What...

20:27.394 --> 20:28.937
is a sloop?

20:28.937 --> 20:33.066
A sloop is a square-rigged
sailing boat with one mast.

20:33.066 --> 20:34.984
Okay, Is it like a-- a ketch?

20:34.984 --> 20:36.069
No, no. No.

20:36.069 --> 20:37.278
A ketch has two masts.

20:37.278 --> 20:38.446
Two masts.

20:38.446 --> 20:39.322
The mizzen
in front of the helm--

20:39.322 --> 20:40.323
that's what makes it a ketch.

20:40.323 --> 20:42.117
Of course. Of course.

20:42.117 --> 20:43.785
Is yours a ketch?

20:43.785 --> 20:45.745
No. No, no.

20:45.745 --> 20:48.081
A ketch is a sailing boat,
ours is a fishing boat.

20:48.081 --> 20:50.000
Okay.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.292
- A gill netter?
- Exactly!

20:51.292 --> 20:52.252
- Yeah.
- See, you get it!

20:52.252 --> 20:53.586
Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

20:54.713 --> 20:56.047
So, let me get this straight...

20:56.047 --> 20:57.465
you're just out there
in the middle of the ocean,

20:57.465 --> 20:59.676
bobbing around...

20:59.676 --> 21:01.261
throwing nets?

21:01.261 --> 21:02.595
No.

21:02.595 --> 21:03.972
That is what the crew does.

21:03.972 --> 21:04.973
Okay.

21:04.973 --> 21:08.059
Me? I am the first mate.

21:08.059 --> 21:09.019
Oh, you're upper management?

21:09.019 --> 21:10.186
Oh, yeah.

21:10.186 --> 21:11.187
Those glasses
are for you, then.

21:11.187 --> 21:12.564
Thank you.

21:12.564 --> 21:14.649
Hast ye ever run into
that great white whale,

21:14.649 --> 21:16.151
Moby Dick?

21:16.151 --> 21:17.318
No.

21:17.318 --> 21:19.029
But we have seen
a bunch of orcas.

21:19.029 --> 21:20.113
They're beautiful.

21:20.113 --> 21:21.406
I bet.

21:54.064 --> 21:55.523
Excuse me, miss?

21:55.523 --> 21:57.025
You were going
to pay for that?

21:57.025 --> 21:58.693
Pay for what?

21:58.693 --> 22:00.779
The scarf that you just
put in your purse.

22:00.779 --> 22:02.030
Are you...

22:02.030 --> 22:03.615
Are you accusing me of stealing?

22:03.615 --> 22:05.075
Do you know who I am?

22:05.075 --> 22:06.743
I just saw you put
the scarf in your purse.

22:06.743 --> 22:08.078
- Oh, come on. You are--
- Excuse me, ma'am--

22:08.078 --> 22:09.788
You up for gelato?

22:09.788 --> 22:10.830
Oh, always.

22:12.082 --> 22:13.416
Let me guess.

22:13.416 --> 22:15.877
Something red.
Strawberry?

22:15.877 --> 22:17.462
How did you know?

22:17.462 --> 22:19.255
You just seem like
a strawberry kind of girl.

22:19.255 --> 22:21.091
Okay.

22:21.091 --> 22:22.842
Two strawberries, please.

22:22.842 --> 22:24.636
Keep that change,
if you don't mind.

22:26.054 --> 22:27.138
So, does L.A. seem different

22:27.138 --> 22:28.348
from the last time
you were here?

22:28.348 --> 22:29.391
No, not really.

22:29.391 --> 22:30.475
Okay.

22:30.475 --> 22:31.768
I mean, if anything,

22:31.768 --> 22:32.602
it seems to be raining
more than I remember.

22:32.602 --> 22:34.396
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

22:34.396 --> 22:35.980
Yeah, you may have brought
the weather down

22:35.980 --> 22:37.023
from Washington.

22:37.023 --> 22:38.942
Okay, sure.

22:38.942 --> 22:41.486
You know, I have to say,

22:41.486 --> 22:43.905
I think the traffic
has actually gotten worse.

22:43.905 --> 22:46.074
If it weren't
for Aunt Dody's bike,

22:46.074 --> 22:47.909
I don't think
I'd ever make it anywhere.

22:47.909 --> 22:50.203
Also, it's nice to offset
my carbon footprint

22:50.203 --> 22:52.163
for a few weeks, though.

22:52.163 --> 22:53.123
You're an environmentalist?

22:53.123 --> 22:54.457
Mm-hmm.

22:54.457 --> 22:55.750
Now that I've gotten
used to waking up

22:55.750 --> 22:57.627
to the sun
peeking through the fog

22:57.627 --> 22:59.629
as it wraps around the mountains

22:59.629 --> 23:01.297
and the sound of water
lapping at the shore,

23:01.297 --> 23:03.216
how could I not be?

23:03.216 --> 23:04.300
I mean, this sounds
very romantic.

23:04.300 --> 23:05.427
Actually...

23:05.427 --> 23:06.553
it is magical.

23:07.929 --> 23:09.681
It does kinda feel like
I'm playing hooky, though.

23:09.681 --> 23:10.765
It's been a long time since
I've been away from the crew.

23:12.350 --> 23:14.394
But it's gotta be nice,
you know?

23:14.394 --> 23:15.979
Taking a little break
in the L.A. sunshine,

23:15.979 --> 23:17.856
relaxing.

23:17.856 --> 23:20.316
I haven't taken a break
in a while from the hustle.

23:21.526 --> 23:22.902
You mean you don't
do this every day?

23:22.902 --> 23:24.195
I do eat things
other than gelato.

23:24.195 --> 23:26.823
Oh, you do?

23:26.823 --> 23:28.491
I'm sorry, do you mind
if I take this?

23:28.491 --> 23:29.534
No. Go. Go.

23:29.534 --> 23:30.660
- You sure?
- Go ahead.

23:30.660 --> 23:32.704
It's a very Los Angeles
thing to do.

23:32.704 --> 23:33.997
Hello?

23:33.997 --> 23:35.582
Hey, Shutterbot.

23:35.582 --> 23:37.083
Someone just got busted
for shoplifting,

23:37.083 --> 23:38.376
and it's none other

23:38.376 --> 23:39.961
than the media darling herself,
Devon Davies.

23:39.961 --> 23:41.629
You'd better hurry.

23:41.629 --> 23:42.881
You don't need
to check my stuff!

23:42.881 --> 23:44.466
- No, we need to check.
- No! Get your hands--

23:44.466 --> 23:45.925
I can't make it.

23:48.803 --> 23:50.513
I'm, uh...
I'm busy at the moment.

23:50.513 --> 23:51.848
<i>Busy? Jake, are you serious?</i>

23:51.848 --> 23:53.350
The cops aren't even here yet.

23:53.350 --> 23:55.268
It's an exclusive
for our taking.

23:58.396 --> 23:59.439
Where?

23:59.439 --> 24:00.357
Montrose & George.

24:00.357 --> 24:01.274
7th and Montana.

24:03.276 --> 24:04.152
All right, I'll be right there.

24:05.570 --> 24:06.905
Get out of my bag!

24:06.905 --> 24:08.239
- Thanks for the tip.
- Call the police.

24:08.239 --> 24:09.783
This is ridiculous!

24:09.783 --> 24:11.034
- It's the same one that--
- This is absolutely ridiculous!

24:11.034 --> 24:12.369
Sorry about that.

24:12.369 --> 24:14.371
Um, something's
kinda come up at work.

24:14.371 --> 24:15.246
Would you mind terribly if I...?

24:15.246 --> 24:16.748
Oh, go. Go.

24:16.748 --> 24:17.916
- You sure?
- Of course.

24:19.876 --> 24:21.711
- Can I call you?
- Please.

24:21.711 --> 24:23.338
Okay. Enjoy the sunshine.

24:36.434 --> 24:39.312
Stop! Get off of me!

24:39.312 --> 24:40.939
Get off!
This is ridiculous!

24:42.190 --> 24:43.692
- I was gonna pay for it!
- Oh, yeah, I'm sure of it.

24:46.319 --> 24:47.278
Do you know who I am?

24:47.278 --> 24:48.863
I wanna talk to my lawyers.

24:50.615 --> 24:52.826
Guys, come on!
Let me out!

24:55.453 --> 24:56.913
Such a shame.

24:56.913 --> 24:58.248
A million a movie just
isn't enough for some people.

25:05.380 --> 25:06.256
For you.

25:06.256 --> 25:07.298
Thank you.

25:07.298 --> 25:08.758
You're welcome.

25:08.758 --> 25:11.052
So, have you been enjoying
your time back in L.A.?

25:11.052 --> 25:11.970
Yeah. Yeah.

25:11.970 --> 25:14.764
Just, uh, exploring, you know?

25:14.764 --> 25:16.433
Hmm.

25:16.433 --> 25:17.809
All by your lonesome?

25:17.809 --> 25:18.768
Yeah.

25:18.768 --> 25:19.936
Oh, Beth Plimsoll,

25:19.936 --> 25:22.439
you know that
you can't keep a secret.

25:22.439 --> 25:24.065
It's the family curse.

25:24.065 --> 25:27.360
Try to lie and those ears
light up like a barber pole.

25:27.360 --> 25:29.863
Okay. Well, I might have
met someone.

25:29.863 --> 25:31.906
Ah-hah!
See, I knew it!

25:31.906 --> 25:33.158
I was wondering why you wanted

25:33.158 --> 25:35.452
to rush out of the house
to that bike ride today.

25:35.452 --> 25:36.953
Why didn't you say anything?

25:36.953 --> 25:38.079
Well, I didn't wanna make
a big deal out of it.

25:38.079 --> 25:38.997
We just met.

25:38.997 --> 25:40.206
Mm.

25:40.206 --> 25:41.458
- He's nice.
- Mm?

25:41.458 --> 25:43.460
Actually, he's really sweet.

25:43.460 --> 25:45.211
He's funny.

25:45.211 --> 25:47.464
And he has this weird knack
of knowing just what to say.

25:47.464 --> 25:48.798
Mm.

25:48.798 --> 25:49.883
We met at the dog park,
of all places.

25:49.883 --> 25:50.925
Mm-hmm.

25:50.925 --> 25:52.218
He was walking
this little pug.

25:52.218 --> 25:53.094
And we just started talking,

25:53.094 --> 25:54.387
and it turns out

25:54.387 --> 25:56.514
we actually have
a lot in common.

25:56.514 --> 25:57.891
We both like the same trails,

25:57.891 --> 25:59.309
we both love
the farmers' market,

25:59.309 --> 26:00.602
and...

26:00.602 --> 26:02.145
he guessed my favorite
ice-cream flavor.

26:02.145 --> 26:03.188
Huh!

26:05.523 --> 26:06.524
Actually, it's kinda weird.

26:06.524 --> 26:08.443
What is?

26:08.443 --> 26:09.736
Well, we just met,

26:09.736 --> 26:11.446
but it feels like he's known me
a lot longer.

26:11.446 --> 26:12.947
So does Prince Charming
have a name?

26:12.947 --> 26:14.657
He does, yes. Jacob.

26:14.657 --> 26:15.950
- Uh-huh.
- Call him Jake.

26:15.950 --> 26:17.285
Jake Myer.

26:17.285 --> 26:19.162
And when do I get to meet
the illustrious Mr. Myer?

26:20.372 --> 26:22.499
Well, Aunt Dody,
I just met him.

26:22.499 --> 26:24.501
Oh, right.
Okay. Mm-hmm, yeah.

26:24.501 --> 26:25.669
Ooh! Here's what we'll do.

26:25.669 --> 26:27.796
See how the next couple
of bike rides go.

26:27.796 --> 26:31.883
If he still makes you
smile like that...

26:31.883 --> 26:33.009
then we invite him for dinner,

26:33.009 --> 26:35.178
and I will make
the special chowder.

26:35.178 --> 26:36.554
That will tell us

26:36.554 --> 26:38.056
exactly what we need to know
about Mr. Jacob Myer.

26:47.607 --> 26:48.525
She wants to do what?

26:48.525 --> 26:50.235
Meet you.

26:50.235 --> 26:51.653
Okay.

26:51.653 --> 26:54.489
I may have very casually
mentioned you in conversation.

26:54.489 --> 26:55.782
All right.

26:55.782 --> 26:57.992
And now she is insisting
on making you dinner.

26:57.992 --> 26:59.577
Dinner?

26:59.577 --> 27:01.121
Wow. When?

27:02.330 --> 27:03.498
Tonight?

27:03.498 --> 27:04.582
Tonight.

27:04.582 --> 27:05.709
I love it.

27:05.709 --> 27:07.085
- You do?
- Of course.

27:07.085 --> 27:09.087
Good, 'cause I got
the shopping list right here.

27:09.087 --> 27:10.588
- Great.
- It's very detailed.

27:10.588 --> 27:11.464
She's leaving
nothing to chance.

27:11.464 --> 27:12.924
As she shouldn't.

27:12.924 --> 27:15.802
She's actually making
her famous clam chowder.

27:15.802 --> 27:17.387
Now, I shouldn't be
telling you this,

27:17.387 --> 27:18.680
but it would help if this was

27:18.680 --> 27:20.473
the best clam chowder
you have ever tasted.

27:21.975 --> 27:23.351
This sounds concerning.
Is it not?

27:23.351 --> 27:24.602
Oh.

27:24.602 --> 27:25.395
No, no, no, it's good.
It's good.

27:25.395 --> 27:26.688
Okay.

27:26.688 --> 27:28.189
She claims it has
a secret ingredient.

27:28.189 --> 27:31.609
I think the secret is she uses
double the cooking sherry.

27:31.609 --> 27:33.111
Sherry.
I can deal with sherry.

27:33.111 --> 27:34.571
Good. Good.

27:34.571 --> 27:36.364
Okay, cauliflower, leeks.

27:36.364 --> 27:38.450
Let's do two onions, please.

27:38.450 --> 27:39.492
Two onions.
Coming up.

27:40.952 --> 27:42.620
- Done.
- And three potatoes.

27:42.620 --> 27:44.289
Three potatoes.
Big ones.

27:44.289 --> 27:46.291
Perfect.

27:46.291 --> 27:47.542
Done.

27:47.542 --> 27:48.793
- You're so strong.
- Thank you.

27:48.793 --> 27:50.003
- Right this way.
- Yes, ma'am.

27:51.963 --> 27:53.465
So, when'd you get
your first bike?

27:53.465 --> 27:54.841
Uh, I was six.

27:54.841 --> 27:56.968
Didn't know how to ride it
until I was eight.

27:56.968 --> 27:58.303
All that time,
you were on training wheels?

27:58.303 --> 27:59.387
Mm-hmm. I was, yes.

27:59.387 --> 28:00.513
I was too busy

28:00.513 --> 28:01.890
learning how to find

28:01.890 --> 28:03.141
the best spots
for fresh-water-salmon fishing.

28:03.141 --> 28:04.642
Of course, you were.
What am I thinking?

28:04.642 --> 28:05.810
Yeah, if you ever wanna find

28:05.810 --> 28:07.354
the fattest salmon
in peak season...

28:07.354 --> 28:08.605
I'm your girl.

28:08.605 --> 28:10.732
Good to know.
Good to know.

28:10.732 --> 28:11.733
And what about you?

28:11.733 --> 28:13.818
When'd you get
your first bike?

28:13.818 --> 28:14.944
First bicycle
when I was five.

28:14.944 --> 28:16.196
First bike
when I was 16.

28:16.196 --> 28:17.822
Oh, do you mean,
like, a motorbike?

28:17.822 --> 28:19.491
- Yeah, I do.
- Nice.

28:19.491 --> 28:22.160
I worked every summer
for my uncle to pay it off.

28:22.160 --> 28:24.996
So, you're one of
those "cool" photographers.

28:24.996 --> 28:26.790
I'm full of surprises.

28:26.790 --> 28:28.875
Oh, I'm out of water.

28:28.875 --> 28:30.585
I'm gonna need to stop
and get more on the way home.

28:30.585 --> 28:31.628
Yeah. I'm right around
the corner.

28:31.628 --> 28:32.545
You can fill up there.
Come on.

28:36.841 --> 28:38.551
- Come on in.
- Ooh!

28:38.551 --> 28:40.553
Hey, don't judge.

28:40.553 --> 28:43.556
All right,
make yourself at home.

28:43.556 --> 28:44.974
Don't mind me,

28:44.974 --> 28:47.185
I'm just gonna hide
the incriminating evidence.

28:47.185 --> 28:49.062
Your dirty clothes--
not that incriminating.

28:52.023 --> 28:53.608
Did you take these?

28:53.608 --> 28:55.527
Yeah.
Yeah, a long time ago.

28:55.527 --> 28:57.028
Jake, they're beautiful!

28:57.028 --> 28:58.446
Why didn't you tell me
this is what you do?

28:58.446 --> 29:00.699
Well, 'cause it's not.

29:00.699 --> 29:02.283
Not anymore.

29:03.410 --> 29:05.245
Yeah, it's kind of
a lost art form, anyway.

29:07.914 --> 29:10.834
I used to think the desert
was so lonely.

29:10.834 --> 29:12.419
I don't know.

29:12.419 --> 29:14.921
Since I work on the water,
I think they're kinda the same.

29:14.921 --> 29:16.631
Not lonely,
they're peaceful.

29:20.802 --> 29:22.721
The light in that one
is gorgeous.

29:22.721 --> 29:24.222
You do that on the computer?

29:24.222 --> 29:26.307
No.

29:26.307 --> 29:27.892
No, I did it
with this right here.

29:27.892 --> 29:29.144
What's that?
It looks so old.

29:29.144 --> 29:31.771
Easy. She can hear ya.

29:31.771 --> 29:32.939
- Sorry. Sorry.
- She's got feelings.

29:34.733 --> 29:36.401
This used to be
the best there was.

29:36.401 --> 29:37.777
Still is.

29:37.777 --> 29:38.862
They took this
to the moon, you know.

29:38.862 --> 29:40.405
Hmm.

29:40.405 --> 29:41.406
It's loud.

29:41.406 --> 29:43.074
Yes.

29:43.074 --> 29:45.368
It's 'cause it's not
some wimpy click or beep,

29:45.368 --> 29:47.996
it's a good,
old-fashioned ka-chunk.

29:47.996 --> 29:49.664
Hold on, who's that?

29:49.664 --> 29:51.166
- Beth?
- Me? It is.

29:51.166 --> 29:52.834
- On the runway?
- It's me, Beth.

29:52.834 --> 29:53.918
Who's she wearing?

29:53.918 --> 29:55.128
Work it, girl.
Look at me go.

29:55.128 --> 29:56.671
- Wow...
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

29:56.671 --> 29:57.672
Whose collection is that?

29:57.672 --> 29:59.591
This is from my house.

29:59.591 --> 30:00.675
Beautiful.

30:02.635 --> 30:04.054
Hold on.

30:04.054 --> 30:05.347
Hold it right there.

30:07.307 --> 30:09.476
That's lovely.
Yeah, yeah, don't move.

30:09.476 --> 30:11.144
The light is perfect.

30:17.400 --> 30:18.234
I'm embarrassed.

30:19.819 --> 30:21.488
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

30:21.488 --> 30:22.947
I get carried away
when I'm behind the lens.

30:22.947 --> 30:24.240
I apologize.

30:25.784 --> 30:26.993
Can I see?

30:26.993 --> 30:28.286
- Yeah, you wanna try?
- Mm-hmm.

30:28.286 --> 30:30.622
Come on.

30:30.622 --> 30:31.915
- Two hands.
- Yep.

30:31.915 --> 30:33.124
- Looking through the top.
- Okay.

30:34.459 --> 30:36.044
How you feel about these,
uh, shadows right here?

30:36.044 --> 30:37.796
- You wanna frame that up?
- Mm-hmm.

30:37.796 --> 30:39.964
Wait, why does it look blurry?

30:39.964 --> 30:41.424
Oh, yeah, this lens is...

30:41.424 --> 30:42.717
- Do you mind?
- Oh, yeah. No, please.

30:42.717 --> 30:45.220
Okay. So, right here's
your focus.

30:45.220 --> 30:46.805
Mm-hmm.

30:46.805 --> 30:49.766
Down here...

30:49.766 --> 30:50.725
this is where
you take the picture.

30:50.725 --> 30:52.227
- You feel that?
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

30:52.227 --> 30:55.480
So, on this lens,
focus is crucial.

30:55.480 --> 30:57.023
Okay...

30:59.484 --> 31:00.568
How's that?

31:00.568 --> 31:01.653
Good.

31:03.947 --> 31:05.365
You see how the, uh,

31:05.365 --> 31:08.118
light is playing with
the shadows, constantly moving?

31:08.118 --> 31:09.494
Mm-hmm.

31:09.494 --> 31:10.787
A lot of possibilities,
so just take your time.

31:11.955 --> 31:13.790
Frame it up.

31:13.790 --> 31:15.417
When you feel it...

31:15.417 --> 31:16.376
hit that button.

31:18.920 --> 31:20.588
But how do I know when?

31:20.588 --> 31:22.048
You'll know.

31:29.723 --> 31:30.682
I did it.

31:39.899 --> 31:41.192
Aunt Dody, are you okay?

31:43.069 --> 31:44.029
Yeah, yeah, I'm, uh...

31:44.029 --> 31:46.156
I'm with him right now.

31:46.156 --> 31:47.824
Mm-hmm.
Okay, we'll talk later.

31:47.824 --> 31:48.658
Okay, bye-bye. Bye.

31:49.743 --> 31:52.454
Sorry.

31:52.454 --> 31:54.247
I have to water
my aunt's orchids.

31:54.247 --> 31:55.707
Okay.

31:55.707 --> 31:56.708
She like orchids?

31:56.708 --> 31:58.543
Oh, loves them.

31:58.543 --> 32:00.086
So, say six for dinner?

32:00.086 --> 32:01.463
- Yeah.
- You have the address?

32:01.463 --> 32:02.881
- I do.
- Great.

32:02.881 --> 32:04.466
Okay.

32:08.511 --> 32:10.055
Uh...

32:10.055 --> 32:11.181
Yeah, thanks.

32:14.517 --> 32:16.394
- Shall I bring anything?
- No, no. No.

32:16.394 --> 32:17.479
Thank you.

32:29.199 --> 32:30.742
Now, what do we have here?

32:32.369 --> 32:33.787
Hey, Vern, do you have a sec?

32:33.787 --> 32:35.622
What is it?
I've got a meeting.

32:35.622 --> 32:36.790
What do you think of this?

32:38.249 --> 32:39.417
Yeah, it's not bad.

32:39.417 --> 32:40.502
Not bad?

32:40.502 --> 32:42.295
It's gorgeous.

32:42.295 --> 32:43.838
This is exactly
what we need.

32:43.838 --> 32:44.923
It's one of Jake Myers'.

32:44.923 --> 32:46.007
Who?

32:46.007 --> 32:47.175
He's a freelancer.

32:47.175 --> 32:48.343
One of our best.

32:48.343 --> 32:49.386
I think we should run this.

32:50.679 --> 32:51.596
Your call.

33:02.899 --> 33:04.150
Welcome!

33:04.150 --> 33:05.193
Come on in.

33:10.156 --> 33:12.867
Wow, she really likes orchids.

33:12.867 --> 33:14.202
Yeah.

33:14.202 --> 33:15.286
Aren't you going
to introduce us?

33:15.286 --> 33:16.579
Sorry. Aunt Dody,
this is Jake Myer.

33:16.579 --> 33:17.497
Jake, Aunt Dody.

33:18.456 --> 33:20.375
- This is for you.
- Oh!

33:20.375 --> 33:21.584
I'm just gonna place it
over here

33:21.584 --> 33:24.045
with the many others
that you also have.

33:24.045 --> 33:25.797
A frivolous Phalaenopsis.

33:25.797 --> 33:27.799
That's one of my favorites.

33:27.799 --> 33:29.092
How did you know?

33:29.092 --> 33:30.552
Lucky guess.

33:32.887 --> 33:34.305
Huh.

33:34.305 --> 33:36.516
Well, uh, we don't need
to congregate here.

33:36.516 --> 33:37.976
Why don't you come in?
After you.

33:37.976 --> 33:39.519
Thank you.

33:45.650 --> 33:46.818
Oh, start, you two!

33:46.818 --> 33:47.902
Please, don't wait for me.

33:47.902 --> 33:49.654
Okay. It smells delicious.

33:49.654 --> 33:51.281
Mm-hmm.

33:59.080 --> 34:00.415
Well?

34:03.043 --> 34:04.127
It's incredible.

34:04.127 --> 34:05.337
Yes!

34:05.337 --> 34:06.671
I've never had
anything quite like it.

34:06.671 --> 34:08.673
Yeah, that is
a Plimsoll family recipe

34:08.673 --> 34:10.175
passed down from
my great-great-grandmother.

34:10.175 --> 34:11.760
That is lovely.

34:11.760 --> 34:13.678
I'm gonna have to cook
for you sometime.

34:13.678 --> 34:15.180
You cook?

34:15.180 --> 34:17.849
Don't judge a photographer
by his camera.

34:17.849 --> 34:19.184
- Okay?
- All right, okay.

34:19.184 --> 34:20.852
This also has
a secret ingredient.

34:20.852 --> 34:21.936
Oh, yeah.

34:21.936 --> 34:23.021
She wouldn't even tell me

34:23.021 --> 34:24.064
until I swore on
a stack of Bibles.

34:24.064 --> 34:25.857
Of course.

34:25.857 --> 34:28.193
Come on, let's hear it.

34:28.193 --> 34:29.152
Oh, what good's a secret
if everyone knows?

34:29.152 --> 34:30.612
Yes!

34:30.612 --> 34:32.906
I double up
on the cooking sherry.

34:32.906 --> 34:34.949
Aunt Dody!

34:34.949 --> 34:37.035
You just gave it up like that!

34:37.035 --> 34:38.286
Don't worry,
I won't tell a soul.

34:39.704 --> 34:41.790
Now, Beth says that you are
a wonderful photographer.

34:41.790 --> 34:43.208
Do you do that for a living?

34:43.208 --> 34:45.752
Um... yeah.

34:45.752 --> 34:46.920
I'm a, uh...

34:46.920 --> 34:48.088
what you call a "stringer".

34:48.088 --> 34:49.506
I take photos
for different outlets.

34:49.506 --> 34:51.758
News. Feature pieces.
That kind of thing.

34:51.758 --> 34:52.842
I, uh, was telling her

34:52.842 --> 34:54.052
about the pictures
in your apartment.

34:54.052 --> 34:55.095
They're so beautiful.

34:55.095 --> 34:56.054
They should be in a book.

34:56.054 --> 34:57.931
Thank you.

34:57.931 --> 34:59.057
They are, actually.

34:59.057 --> 35:00.475
Or, they were.

35:00.475 --> 35:03.061
I published a collection
years ago.

35:03.061 --> 35:03.853
Wasn't exactly a best-seller.

35:03.853 --> 35:05.355
Why not?

35:05.355 --> 35:07.315
I just don't think
it's what people want anymore.

35:07.315 --> 35:08.900
You used to have to wait
for hours

35:08.900 --> 35:10.360
to take the perfect photo.

35:10.360 --> 35:11.277
Nowadays,
everything's digital...

35:11.277 --> 35:12.696
composited.

35:12.696 --> 35:14.531
All you need
is a phone and a computer.

35:14.531 --> 35:17.242
I don't think people
see the beauty

35:17.242 --> 35:18.785
in the little things anymore.

35:20.662 --> 35:21.996
In what's
right in front of them.

35:25.125 --> 35:27.127
I think you're very talented,

35:27.127 --> 35:28.628
and I am gonna order that book.

35:30.714 --> 35:32.090
I think that might be tough.
I don't think there's any left.

35:32.090 --> 35:33.091
What?

35:33.091 --> 35:34.217
I sold five.

35:34.217 --> 35:36.428
Uh, Mom got three.

35:36.428 --> 35:37.846
And the rest ended up
on some bargain table

35:37.846 --> 35:39.180
where books go to die, so...

35:39.180 --> 35:42.559
Oh...

35:42.559 --> 35:46.354
Well, I've successfully
killed the vibe here.

35:46.354 --> 35:47.689
Apologize for that.

35:53.236 --> 35:54.446
All right, let me
get these out of here.

35:54.446 --> 35:55.530
Oh, darling,
let me help you.

35:55.530 --> 35:56.698
- Can I help?
- No, no, no. You're good.

35:56.698 --> 35:58.033
- Are you sure?
- Thank you for offering.

35:58.033 --> 35:59.868
- Yeah, of course.
- Here you go.

35:59.868 --> 36:00.869
So...

36:02.620 --> 36:04.748
...what are your intentions
with my niece, if I may ask?

36:05.999 --> 36:07.083
Intentions?

36:07.083 --> 36:08.251
Well, everybody's
got intentions.

36:08.251 --> 36:09.502
Nothing wrong with that.

36:09.502 --> 36:10.879
What are yours?

36:12.088 --> 36:12.922
I really like her.

36:14.341 --> 36:15.425
Well, of course you do.

36:16.426 --> 36:17.802
She's an absolute treasure.

36:19.512 --> 36:20.805
No argument there.

36:22.098 --> 36:23.308
Jacob, you are a charming boy.

36:23.308 --> 36:25.060
It is no wonder that my Beth
is fond of you.

36:25.060 --> 36:27.312
But there is something
that you need to understand.

36:27.312 --> 36:29.147
Yes?

36:29.147 --> 36:30.607
Beth has been hurt before,

36:30.607 --> 36:32.567
so she doesn't let
her guard down easily.

36:33.943 --> 36:38.365
She's only ever really
fallen hard for one boy, but...

36:38.365 --> 36:39.574
once was plenty.

36:41.659 --> 36:42.952
She thought that he was the one.

36:44.287 --> 36:45.789
So, like I said,

36:45.789 --> 36:47.457
everybody's got
their intentions,

36:47.457 --> 36:49.542
and yours are to be
an honorable gentleman,

36:49.542 --> 36:51.252
and mine are to do
everything I can

36:51.252 --> 36:52.671
to make sure

36:52.671 --> 36:54.464
that nothing like that
ever happens to her again.

36:56.007 --> 36:57.592
Not if I have something
to say about it.

36:59.469 --> 37:00.845
Do I make myself clear?

37:02.055 --> 37:03.264
Yes, ma'am.

37:03.264 --> 37:04.474
All right, you two.

37:04.474 --> 37:05.809
What'd I miss?

37:05.809 --> 37:07.686
Oh, nothing serious, darling.

37:07.686 --> 37:09.604
We were just
getting acquainted.

37:12.565 --> 37:13.817
A little chitchat
between friends.

37:17.696 --> 37:19.406
Did you always know
you wanted to be an artist?

37:19.406 --> 37:21.950
Uh... I mean, yeah.

37:21.950 --> 37:23.576
Always tried to capture

37:23.576 --> 37:25.120
the beauty of things
in a certain light,

37:25.120 --> 37:26.454
so that I can share

37:26.454 --> 37:27.831
what may otherwise
be overlooked.

37:27.831 --> 37:29.290
Oh!

37:29.290 --> 37:30.458
I mean, I hope that my art

37:30.458 --> 37:31.376
encouraged people
to see things that way.

37:31.376 --> 37:33.837
What about you?

37:33.837 --> 37:35.130
Always want to save the world?

37:35.130 --> 37:37.090
Well...

37:37.090 --> 37:37.966
I've always loved nature.

37:37.966 --> 37:39.175
Mm-hmm.

37:39.175 --> 37:41.302
I've always wanted
to protect it.

37:41.302 --> 37:42.470
But I don't really wanna be

37:42.470 --> 37:43.388
the poster girl for that,
you know?

37:43.388 --> 37:44.472
Mm-hmm.

37:44.472 --> 37:46.516
Make it all about me.

37:46.516 --> 37:47.726
I think change can be
just as powerful

37:47.726 --> 37:50.270
when it's done
on a smaller scale.

37:50.270 --> 37:51.521
So, I still advocate

37:51.521 --> 37:52.814
for living in harmony
with the environment,

37:52.814 --> 37:55.483
just, like, in a different way
than I used to.

37:55.483 --> 37:56.735
This is incredibly admirable.

37:56.735 --> 37:57.861
Thank you. Thank you.

37:59.029 --> 38:00.572
Also, I just like
being out on the water,

38:00.572 --> 38:02.615
so there's that, too.

38:02.615 --> 38:03.950
Yeah. I used to always think

38:03.950 --> 38:06.745
I'd end up somewhere quieter
than L.A., but...

38:06.745 --> 38:08.830
my life is full of changes.

38:08.830 --> 38:11.291
I think I'm learning
to go with the flow.

38:11.291 --> 38:12.709
Sounds like the sea.

38:14.794 --> 38:16.629
It does sound like the sea.

38:21.343 --> 38:22.344
This better be good.

38:22.344 --> 38:23.428
Oh, it's better than good.

38:23.428 --> 38:25.388
It is the best.

38:25.388 --> 38:26.681
Look who made the front cover.

38:30.143 --> 38:31.353
Where'd you get this?

38:31.353 --> 38:32.562
What do you mean?
It was with all the others.

38:34.856 --> 38:36.191
No.

38:36.191 --> 38:37.317
No, no, no, no, no.

38:37.317 --> 38:38.693
You weren't supposed
to have this one.

38:38.693 --> 38:40.779
This is a mistake.

38:40.779 --> 38:42.197
This is a terrible mistake.

38:42.197 --> 38:44.032
I thought
you would be thrilled!

38:44.032 --> 38:45.241
When does this go out?

38:45.241 --> 38:46.951
It already has.

38:46.951 --> 38:48.286
It hit the newsstands
an hour ago.

38:48.286 --> 38:49.412
Oh...

38:49.412 --> 38:50.288
Wait, where are you going?

38:51.748 --> 38:53.083
- To warn her.
- Who?

38:53.083 --> 38:54.250
Her!

39:01.549 --> 39:02.967
Beth?

39:04.260 --> 39:05.595
Aunt Dody?

39:10.475 --> 39:11.226
So, Goldie was a runt.

39:11.226 --> 39:12.352
But you know what?

39:12.352 --> 39:13.520
I'm all for the underdog,

39:13.520 --> 39:14.562
so I took a look
at those puppies,

39:14.562 --> 39:15.689
and I saw her.

39:15.689 --> 39:18.066
We connected eyes,
and I went...

39:18.066 --> 39:19.109
Hey!

39:19.109 --> 39:20.068
Excuse me.

39:22.445 --> 39:23.738
Darling, that's you!

39:26.116 --> 39:27.701
Oh...

39:30.036 --> 39:31.371
What is happening?

39:31.371 --> 39:33.081
Darling, I think
we should get going now.

39:33.081 --> 39:34.499
Come on.

39:34.499 --> 39:36.084
Hi there.

39:37.293 --> 39:38.211
Everybody's here.

39:38.211 --> 39:39.254
Yeah.

39:39.254 --> 39:40.672
Oh... Nice. Uh-huh.

39:40.672 --> 39:41.965
Oh, selfies.

39:43.758 --> 39:44.884
Look, everybody, all around.

39:46.302 --> 39:47.637
Hi.

39:48.555 --> 39:49.848
Okay, that's enough!

39:49.848 --> 39:51.641
Everybody, out of the way,
girl's coming through.

39:51.641 --> 39:52.976
- Oh, excuse me.
- Excuse me.

39:52.976 --> 39:54.144
Excuse me.

39:54.144 --> 39:55.437
Excuse me! Excuse me!

39:55.437 --> 39:56.688
Excuse us!

39:58.815 --> 40:01.109
Okay. She says,
"Go to the Google."

40:01.109 --> 40:02.152
I am on Google.

40:02.152 --> 40:03.445
He is on--

40:03.445 --> 40:04.946
He is on Google.

40:04.946 --> 40:06.614
<i>Okay. Now type in
the "Flower Girl".</i>

40:06.614 --> 40:08.616
"Flower Girl."

40:08.616 --> 40:10.368
Like daisy,
not like whole wheat.

40:11.661 --> 40:12.829
Guys, guys.
Are you focused?

40:12.829 --> 40:13.788
Sorry.

40:15.373 --> 40:17.334
Holy cow.
There's dozens of them.

40:17.334 --> 40:18.418
There it is.

40:18.418 --> 40:19.711
FB. IG.

40:19.711 --> 40:21.296
All the socials.

40:21.296 --> 40:22.964
Click on one.

40:22.964 --> 40:24.632
Which one?

40:24.632 --> 40:26.718
It really doesn't matter,
they are all the same.

40:33.475 --> 40:34.601
Wow!

40:34.601 --> 40:36.227
Beth, that...

40:36.227 --> 40:37.520
that's beautiful.

40:37.520 --> 40:38.813
You say this is in a magazine?

40:38.813 --> 40:40.357
Dad, it was on the cover.

40:40.357 --> 40:41.858
And now it's everywhere.

40:41.858 --> 40:42.817
It was like
I went to sleep last night,

40:42.817 --> 40:44.361
woke up this morning,

40:44.361 --> 40:45.612
and walked out on some stage
in front of the whole world.

40:45.612 --> 40:46.863
So you're saying

40:46.863 --> 40:48.865
that somebody
can just take your picture,

40:48.865 --> 40:50.784
splash it all over creation,

40:50.784 --> 40:52.660
and not ask your permission?

40:52.660 --> 40:53.787
Like, what kind of a person
does that?

40:53.787 --> 40:55.830
I don't know.

40:55.830 --> 40:57.749
But I'm gonna find out.

41:02.212 --> 41:03.505
It's you!

41:03.505 --> 41:04.589
It's me. Hi.
Who did this?

41:04.589 --> 41:06.216
That would be me.

41:08.843 --> 41:10.762
Wow! So you're the cover girl
live and in person.

41:10.762 --> 41:12.055
Yes, it's me,

41:12.055 --> 41:13.515
and I'm trying to find out
who did this.

41:13.515 --> 41:15.100
All it says is "Shutterbot".

41:15.100 --> 41:16.267
Well, I'm afraid

41:16.267 --> 41:18.019
I can't give
that information out, Ms...?

41:18.019 --> 41:19.813
I didn't give anyone
permission to print this.

41:19.813 --> 41:21.189
Well, that doesn't
really matter.

41:21.189 --> 41:23.400
As long as it's not
for commercial exploitation,

41:23.400 --> 41:24.693
and was taken in a public place,

41:24.693 --> 41:26.403
it's perfectly legal.

41:26.403 --> 41:27.904
Happens all the time.

41:27.904 --> 41:29.197
Um...

41:29.197 --> 41:30.198
it's called--

41:30.198 --> 41:31.741
An invasion of privacy!

41:31.741 --> 41:34.994
Well, we prefer
to call it photojournalism.

41:34.994 --> 41:37.288
Listen, it really
doesn't matter what it's called.

41:37.288 --> 41:38.123
Who is "Shutterbot"?

41:39.457 --> 41:40.583
I'm afraid
I can't tell you that.

41:40.583 --> 41:42.210
Why not?

41:42.210 --> 41:45.213
Look, if he wanted the public
to know his real name,

41:45.213 --> 41:46.673
he would have used it.

41:46.673 --> 41:47.841
But I can tell you this...

41:47.841 --> 41:49.968
he does specialize
in shooting celebrities,

41:49.968 --> 41:51.761
so you are in great company.

41:54.055 --> 41:56.057
But here's what I can do.

41:56.057 --> 41:57.559
If you'd like to leave
your name and number,

41:57.559 --> 41:58.643
I can try to get
a message to him.

41:58.643 --> 41:59.894
Really?

41:59.894 --> 42:01.771
Well, I said I can try.

42:01.771 --> 42:03.064
Can't promise anything,
so don't get your hopes up.

42:03.064 --> 42:04.941
Okay.

42:04.941 --> 42:06.693
And, uh, your name again?

42:06.693 --> 42:07.861
My name is Beth.

42:07.861 --> 42:08.945
Beth Plimsoll.

42:09.904 --> 42:11.239
Beth Plimsoll.

42:11.239 --> 42:12.449
And the number
where you can be reached?

42:17.787 --> 42:19.039
Why so glum?

42:19.039 --> 42:21.249
We should be celebrating,
cover boy.

42:21.249 --> 42:22.751
Oh, you go ahead.

42:22.751 --> 42:24.085
I'm okay.
I'm, uh...

42:24.085 --> 42:25.170
I don't think
I'm in the mood.

42:25.170 --> 42:26.671
Come on.
Cheer up.

42:26.671 --> 42:28.673
Thanks to your little snapshot,

42:28.673 --> 42:29.758
we're gonna generate

42:29.758 --> 42:30.759
more downloads
and more ad revenue

42:30.759 --> 42:32.260
than anything we've ever run.

42:32.260 --> 42:33.762
All thanks to you.

42:33.762 --> 42:35.972
Don't thank me, thank her.

42:37.474 --> 42:39.309
You mean Beth Plimsoll?

42:41.561 --> 42:43.021
How do you know her name?

42:43.021 --> 42:46.900
Because maybe Ms. Plimsoll
showed up at the office today.

42:46.900 --> 42:49.027
Looking for,
of all people, you.

42:49.027 --> 42:50.987
Only she didn't know it was you.

42:52.489 --> 42:53.782
You didn't tell her?

42:53.782 --> 42:55.408
Of course not.

42:55.408 --> 42:56.951
And spoil all your fun?

42:56.951 --> 42:58.995
She does wanna meet you, though.

42:58.995 --> 43:02.624
Only, I wasn't sure
which you she wanted to meet.

43:02.624 --> 43:05.794
Jake Myer,
lovable boy next door,

43:05.794 --> 43:08.880
or the dark,
mysterious Shutterbot...

43:08.880 --> 43:10.340
ruthless digital assassin?

43:10.340 --> 43:11.841
Please don't.

43:12.967 --> 43:14.719
I don't get it.

43:14.719 --> 43:16.179
It was a mistake.

43:16.179 --> 43:18.139
A glorious one.

43:18.139 --> 43:19.432
Why don't you just tell her?

43:28.650 --> 43:29.859
Oh, and she just walked in.

43:29.859 --> 43:31.194
Hold, please.

43:31.194 --> 43:32.862
Beth, you're wanted
on the phone.

43:32.862 --> 43:35.657
Hurry, it sounds important.

43:35.657 --> 43:37.242
Come on, girl,
let's clean you up.

43:37.242 --> 43:38.410
Come on.

43:38.410 --> 43:39.494
Hello?

43:39.494 --> 43:42.080
Who?

43:42.080 --> 43:43.456
No, I'm sorry,
I think you have the wrong n--

43:45.875 --> 43:47.460
Oh, um...

43:47.460 --> 43:49.629
Yes. I, uh--
I just need to think about that.

43:49.629 --> 43:50.630
I'll let you know tomorrow.

43:50.630 --> 43:51.673
Okay, bye-bye. Bye.

43:53.925 --> 43:55.760
That was
the Claire DeLido show.

43:55.760 --> 43:56.761
They want me on as a guest.

43:56.761 --> 43:59.431
Of course, they do!

43:59.431 --> 44:01.016
And you're going
to tell them "yes".

44:01.016 --> 44:02.600
There is no question about it.

44:02.600 --> 44:04.686
One question.
Why me?

44:06.146 --> 44:08.481
Because you're the girl
in the picture, silly.

44:11.693 --> 44:13.069
Welcome back!

44:13.069 --> 44:14.696
We are coming to you live
from Santa Monica

44:14.696 --> 44:17.115
at the 3rd Street
Farmers' Market.

44:17.115 --> 44:18.700
Now, the whole country

44:18.700 --> 44:20.869
has been looking
for our next guest,

44:20.869 --> 44:22.662
but we found her.

44:22.662 --> 44:25.457
You may know her simply
as the "Flower Girl,"

44:25.457 --> 44:27.876
but please welcome Beth Plimsoll
to the show.

44:27.876 --> 44:29.336
Beth, welcome.
It's nice to meet you.

44:29.336 --> 44:30.378
Have a seat.

44:30.378 --> 44:31.338
Oh, thank you.

44:32.756 --> 44:35.759
How does it feel to be
an overnight cyber celebrity?

44:35.759 --> 44:36.801
It's overwhelming.

44:36.801 --> 44:38.345
I can imagine.

44:38.345 --> 44:40.805
So, for those of you
who don't know,

44:40.805 --> 44:42.724
Beth was the unwitting subject

44:42.724 --> 44:44.476
of a photograph that appeared

44:44.476 --> 44:46.728
in a weekly magazine
here in Los Angeles

44:46.728 --> 44:48.938
that has since gone viral.

44:48.938 --> 44:51.107
This was just
a candid shot, correct?

44:51.107 --> 44:52.525
Totally candid.

44:52.525 --> 44:54.986
You didn't even know
that it was being taken?

44:54.986 --> 44:56.321
You didn't know
the photographer?

44:56.321 --> 44:57.739
<i>No.
No, I still don't, actually.</i>

44:57.739 --> 44:58.782
<i>And nobody</i>

44:58.782 --> 45:00.033
<i>has come forward to say,</i>

45:00.033 --> 45:01.493
<i>"Hey, I'm the one
that made you famous"?</i>

45:01.493 --> 45:03.828
<i>No, but I wish they would.</i>

45:03.828 --> 45:05.789
<i>I would really
like to talk to them.</i>

45:06.539 --> 45:07.582
<i>So would we.</i>

45:07.582 --> 45:09.501
Hey, are you catching this?

45:09.501 --> 45:11.920
It's incredible.

45:11.920 --> 45:13.171
How did they find her so quick?

45:14.339 --> 45:16.299
Mm... maybe they had
a little help.

45:16.299 --> 45:19.427
Oh, you gave them her number.

45:19.427 --> 45:20.804
I did.

45:20.804 --> 45:22.514
Listen, we'll talk later.

45:24.057 --> 45:26.184
<i>Now, celebrity photos
going viral</i>

45:26.184 --> 45:29.396
<i>is very much
a Los Angeles thing,</i>

45:29.396 --> 45:31.439
<i>but you don't even live here,
do you?</i>

45:31.439 --> 45:33.566
<i>No. No, I actually work on
my dad's fishing boat up north.</i>

45:35.193 --> 45:37.612
What is it about this picture

45:37.612 --> 45:41.199
that you think has captured
everyone's imagination?

45:41.199 --> 45:43.702
I mean, it is a beautiful shot.

45:43.702 --> 45:45.370
Thank you.

45:45.370 --> 45:47.163
<i>But, there's gotta be
more than that.</i>

45:47.163 --> 45:48.331
<i>What is it?</i>

45:50.792 --> 45:53.003
I think it is a private moment

45:53.003 --> 45:55.130
of a person appreciating
something beautiful.

45:56.798 --> 45:58.174
<i>A private moment...</i>

45:58.174 --> 46:00.343
<i>now shared
by millions of strangers.</i>

46:01.594 --> 46:02.679
<i>Maybe only semi-private.</i>

46:02.679 --> 46:03.763
Yeah.

46:05.181 --> 46:06.683
Have you received any offers?

46:06.683 --> 46:08.059
I mean, you can't even appear

46:08.059 --> 46:09.602
on a surveillance video
in this town

46:09.602 --> 46:10.562
and not get offers.

46:10.562 --> 46:11.563
And do not ask me
how I know that.

46:12.772 --> 46:13.940
I have had a couple, yes.

46:13.940 --> 46:16.401
Not for a talk show,
though, right?

46:16.401 --> 46:19.320
Please, we have
enough competition already.

46:20.530 --> 46:21.614
We will find out that answer
when we come back.

46:22.741 --> 46:23.908
So...

46:23.908 --> 46:25.410
what's it like
being your very own meme?

46:25.410 --> 46:26.953
Oh...

46:26.953 --> 46:29.205
It's, like, since that show,
my phone hasn't stopped ringing.

46:29.205 --> 46:30.832
There's this florist guy

46:30.832 --> 46:32.834
that wants to use my picture
for his billboards,

46:32.834 --> 46:34.461
and this talent agent
is calling.

46:34.461 --> 46:35.628
It's wild.

46:36.796 --> 46:37.672
No sign of Shutterbot?

46:37.672 --> 46:38.923
No!

46:38.923 --> 46:40.091
It's weird.

46:40.091 --> 46:40.925
I don't know
what he's so afraid of,

46:40.925 --> 46:42.802
I'm not gonna bite.

46:42.802 --> 46:43.928
Maybe he doesn't know that.

46:43.928 --> 46:45.263
Maybe he thinks

46:45.263 --> 46:46.723
that you might blame him
for all this hoopla.

46:48.099 --> 46:49.309
After you.

46:49.309 --> 46:50.643
Oh, I love this place.

46:53.021 --> 46:54.522
Get you a little pillow here.

46:54.522 --> 46:56.483
Ohh...

46:56.483 --> 46:58.401
That's very chivalrous of you.
Thank you.

46:58.401 --> 46:59.486
Thank you.

47:00.653 --> 47:03.073
I, uh...

47:03.073 --> 47:03.990
I got you a little something.

47:03.990 --> 47:05.742
You did?

47:05.742 --> 47:06.910
It's not much, but, um--

47:06.910 --> 47:08.328
Ohh, Jake!

47:10.246 --> 47:11.498
Oh, that is beautiful.

47:13.166 --> 47:14.167
Where'd you get this?

47:15.835 --> 47:17.337
I took it.

47:17.337 --> 47:18.421
Right.

47:20.590 --> 47:22.300
No, I did.

47:26.554 --> 47:28.515
I took it off the internet
like, um, everybody else,

47:28.515 --> 47:31.476
I just did
my little magic on it.

47:31.476 --> 47:33.395
Uh...

47:33.395 --> 47:37.273
I also took the liberty
of giving it a proper title.

47:37.273 --> 47:38.858
"Beth. Flower Girl".

47:40.068 --> 47:41.152
You think ol' Shutterpuss

47:41.152 --> 47:42.904
would mind you
changing the name?

47:42.904 --> 47:44.447
I won't tell if you don't.

47:47.158 --> 47:48.451
Really, that is so lovely.

47:48.451 --> 47:49.661
Thank you.

47:49.661 --> 47:51.413
Of course.

48:10.849 --> 48:12.183
Now, listen,
everybody's trying to get her.

48:12.183 --> 48:15.020
Agents. Managers. Everyone.

48:15.020 --> 48:16.187
Oh, I'm just gonna tell her,

48:16.187 --> 48:17.230
"You sign
with any of those people,

48:17.230 --> 48:18.523
you'll fall through the cracks.

48:18.523 --> 48:20.191
You need someone
who's willing to work for you.

48:20.191 --> 48:22.402
I mean, really work for you.

48:22.402 --> 48:24.612
Make you
their number-one client."

48:24.612 --> 48:25.739
Oops, she's here.
Wish me luck.

48:27.282 --> 48:28.783
Ahh! The face that launched
a thousand clicks.

48:28.783 --> 48:30.201
- Oh, hi. Hi!
- Hi.

48:30.201 --> 48:31.619
- Richie Rosebrook.
- Beth Plimsoll.

48:31.619 --> 48:33.413
Please... join me.

48:35.331 --> 48:36.541
- Thank you.
- Oh, Ma'am!

48:36.541 --> 48:37.917
Could we get some menus
over here, please?

48:42.714 --> 48:45.216
Been a wild ride, I bet,
the past couple weeks.

48:45.216 --> 48:46.968
It's crazy, all of this
from one picture.

48:46.968 --> 48:49.721
It's...
It's not just the picture.

48:49.721 --> 48:52.140
It's you.

48:52.140 --> 48:54.434
You have been blessed
with the perfect look.

48:54.434 --> 48:55.769
Natural. Outdoorsy.

48:59.439 --> 49:01.107
Listen, I'm gonna be
upfront with you.

49:01.107 --> 49:02.317
Okay.

49:02.317 --> 49:04.736
I've got three ad agencies
right now...

49:04.736 --> 49:05.737
today...

49:05.737 --> 49:07.155
right this very minute,

49:07.155 --> 49:10.283
that are looking
for the next fresh face.

49:10.283 --> 49:11.785
And all I gotta say is,

49:11.785 --> 49:14.871
"You want the Flower Girl?

49:14.871 --> 49:16.289
You got her!"

49:17.290 --> 49:18.500
That's so exciting.

49:18.500 --> 49:19.793
I know.

49:21.252 --> 49:23.213
- Aunt Dody?
- Out here!

49:23.213 --> 49:24.381
In the greenhouse!

49:25.924 --> 49:27.175
What are you doing here?

49:27.175 --> 49:28.551
Well, I live here,

49:28.551 --> 49:30.136
according to the name
on the gas bill.

49:30.136 --> 49:32.764
No, no, I mean you came
down the steps all by yourself!

49:32.764 --> 49:35.016
I'm so proud of you!

49:35.016 --> 49:36.434
Don't be so surprised.

49:36.434 --> 49:38.019
While you were out romancing,

49:38.019 --> 49:39.854
I was working the steps.

49:39.854 --> 49:41.773
You didn't think
I was gonna be helpless forever?

49:41.773 --> 49:43.775
Well, I just...

49:43.775 --> 49:45.110
Ooh, but enough about me.
How was lunch?

49:45.110 --> 49:46.403
It was good.

49:46.403 --> 49:48.238
Yeah, he, um...

49:48.238 --> 49:49.572
He says he wants
to be my agent.

49:51.074 --> 49:52.283
Does he think
he can get you work?

49:52.283 --> 49:53.576
I don't know. Apparently.

49:53.576 --> 49:56.204
Well, you're gonna
have to make up your mind.

49:56.204 --> 49:59.207
I was actually hoping
for some advice here.

49:59.207 --> 50:00.458
I think this is something

50:00.458 --> 50:01.918
you are gonna need to decide
for yourself.

50:04.212 --> 50:05.797
Are you home for dinner?

50:05.797 --> 50:07.674
Um...

50:07.674 --> 50:09.092
Oh, uh...

50:09.092 --> 50:10.135
It's all right.

50:10.135 --> 50:11.511
Have a very good time.

50:11.511 --> 50:12.303
Just don't wake Goldie
when you tiptoe in.

50:12.303 --> 50:13.888
Right, I won't.

50:13.888 --> 50:14.931
Sorry about that.

50:14.931 --> 50:16.558
Have fun!

50:16.558 --> 50:17.684
Bye.

50:26.943 --> 50:28.737
Wow.

50:28.737 --> 50:30.196
That was...

50:30.196 --> 50:31.448
Go ahead.

50:32.907 --> 50:34.034
It was delicious.

50:34.034 --> 50:35.076
You mean that?

50:35.076 --> 50:36.745
A hundred percent.

50:36.745 --> 50:38.121
Good.

50:38.121 --> 50:40.415
Yep, I like picking up recipes
everywhere I travel.

50:40.415 --> 50:42.042
Where was tonight's from?

50:42.042 --> 50:43.752
- Tonight's?
- Mm-hmm.

50:43.752 --> 50:44.919
Uh...

50:44.919 --> 50:47.339
this one was from a...

50:47.339 --> 50:49.758
road trip down to Baja.

50:49.758 --> 50:50.842
Ooh!

50:50.842 --> 50:52.552
I was shooting
coastal landscapes,

50:52.552 --> 50:56.806
and a local from La Paz asked me
to shoot his restaurant,

50:56.806 --> 50:59.142
and after having
the meal you just had,

50:59.142 --> 51:01.061
we agreed...

51:01.061 --> 51:03.730
that his recipe
would be fair exchange.

51:04.898 --> 51:06.107
Oh yeah, I'll say.

51:07.359 --> 51:08.943
Most people collect souvenirs,

51:08.943 --> 51:10.111
I collect recipes.

51:10.111 --> 51:10.987
They're a lot more...

51:12.030 --> 51:13.531
Tasty?

51:14.574 --> 51:16.826
Exactly. Cheers.

51:16.826 --> 51:18.119
Cheers.

51:22.374 --> 51:24.626
So, did you, uh,
talk to that agent?

51:24.626 --> 51:26.252
Mm.

51:26.252 --> 51:27.921
Yeah, I met with him today, actually.

51:27.921 --> 51:29.381
He has a bunch of ideas
about what I can do,

51:29.381 --> 51:30.548
meetings lined up.

51:31.549 --> 51:33.176
Something you wanna do?

51:33.176 --> 51:35.720
Well, I can't believe
I'm about to say this, but...

51:35.720 --> 51:38.306
might be kinda fun
to live in the big city again.

51:38.306 --> 51:39.474
Obviously, I know,

51:39.474 --> 51:41.059
different
than working on the boat.

51:41.059 --> 51:42.686
I mean, slightly.

51:45.021 --> 51:45.897
You wouldn't miss it?

51:45.897 --> 51:47.273
Of course.

51:47.273 --> 51:48.858
What if I'm getting
a little too comfortable at sea?

51:48.858 --> 51:50.652
I think it might be good for me

51:50.652 --> 51:52.237
to do something different
for a while.

51:52.237 --> 51:53.988
I mean, yeah. Why not?

51:53.988 --> 51:56.324
This-- This life
that this agent is selling you,

51:56.324 --> 51:57.992
does this feel like it's...

51:57.992 --> 51:59.077
you?

51:59.077 --> 52:00.537
I don't know.

52:02.205 --> 52:03.540
But I'm not afraid
to find out.

52:04.874 --> 52:06.710
Anything that keeps you here
is just fine by me.

52:09.462 --> 52:10.380
How do you feel
about tonight's festivities?

52:10.380 --> 52:12.173
Good.

52:12.173 --> 52:13.091
You wanna get out of here?

52:13.091 --> 52:14.551
Yes, please.

52:24.185 --> 52:26.104
Jake Myer!

52:26.104 --> 52:27.230
Yes?

52:27.230 --> 52:28.690
What is this place?

52:28.690 --> 52:30.567
This is my buddy's place.

52:30.567 --> 52:32.235
He lets me come here
whenever he's out of town.

52:34.571 --> 52:36.990
Look at the stars.

52:36.990 --> 52:38.116
No one ever told me

52:38.116 --> 52:39.868
you could see stars
like this in L.A...

52:39.868 --> 52:41.369
Yeah.

52:41.369 --> 52:42.287
Maybe they're not looking.

52:45.749 --> 52:46.875
Or they just can't see

52:46.875 --> 52:47.917
the beauty
that's right in front of them.

52:52.964 --> 52:56.051
It's kinda like
being out on the ocean.

52:56.051 --> 52:57.218
Good.

52:57.218 --> 52:58.345
Really?

52:58.345 --> 53:00.096
Oh yeah... kinda.
It's close.

53:00.096 --> 53:02.098
Okay. I tried.

53:03.558 --> 53:04.893
I thought
it might be nice for you

53:04.893 --> 53:05.977
to have a little slice of home
in all this madness.

53:10.065 --> 53:11.941
Want to have a seat?

53:11.941 --> 53:13.109
Thank you.

53:18.323 --> 53:20.700
You know, maybe there's
more to the city than I thought.

53:20.700 --> 53:21.743
What if I was wrong?

53:21.743 --> 53:23.286
What if this is where I belong?

53:24.496 --> 53:25.914
Thank you.

53:25.914 --> 53:27.123
I think you can belong
wherever you'd like to belong.

53:30.418 --> 53:31.336
You just gotta look up.

53:34.422 --> 53:36.591
It also helps if you know
a few places like this one, eh?

53:36.591 --> 53:38.134
It really...
really doesn't hurt.

53:40.178 --> 53:41.429
Thank you.

53:41.429 --> 53:43.098
So, what about you?

53:43.098 --> 53:44.641
Does L.A. feel like home?

53:47.143 --> 53:49.020
I don't know that anywhere
really feels like home for me.

53:50.647 --> 53:52.399
Is that why you travel so much?

53:52.399 --> 53:54.317
Probably.

53:54.317 --> 53:55.652
That's probably
a big part of it.

53:56.820 --> 53:58.029
I mean, this city did give me

53:58.029 --> 54:01.574
the one thing that I think
I'm born to do.

54:01.574 --> 54:03.201
But, even when you find that,

54:03.201 --> 54:04.661
it can still feel like
something's missing, you know?

54:07.872 --> 54:09.457
Yeah, I don't know
if something's missing for me.

54:09.457 --> 54:11.501
Hmm.

54:11.501 --> 54:13.336
Or maybe I have it all.

54:16.006 --> 54:18.550
Whatever you decide to do
with all this,

54:18.550 --> 54:19.759
just don't lose yourself in it.

54:21.302 --> 54:23.138
'Cause yourself
is what everybody's falling for.

54:29.227 --> 54:30.353
It's crazy.

54:31.980 --> 54:33.356
All this from one picture?

54:34.774 --> 54:36.067
You know what?

54:36.067 --> 54:39.070
I think...

54:39.070 --> 54:41.906
maybe...

54:41.906 --> 54:43.199
people are just seeing
what I'm seeing.

54:45.910 --> 54:48.455
You are a whole lot more
than just a "Flower Girl".

54:55.462 --> 54:56.379
Thank you.

54:58.506 --> 54:59.591
Cheers.

54:59.591 --> 55:00.967
Cheers!

55:09.059 --> 55:11.436
Yeah, so this agent says
that I have a natural look,

55:11.436 --> 55:12.687
and he loves
that I work on a boat.

55:12.687 --> 55:14.522
Well, what does Dody think?

55:14.522 --> 55:15.690
Oh, she's thrilled.

55:15.690 --> 55:16.858
Says we should go in together.

55:16.858 --> 55:18.443
She thinks
we could pass as sisters.

55:21.279 --> 55:22.989
Oh, sorry. All right.

55:22.989 --> 55:24.074
I know they're crazy down there,

55:24.074 --> 55:25.033
but I don't think
they're that crazy.

55:25.033 --> 55:26.576
I heard that!

55:26.576 --> 55:27.994
Hey, go back to your orchids,

55:27.994 --> 55:29.746
<i>you aging flower child!</i>

55:32.624 --> 55:35.377
Beth, just be careful
down there.

55:35.377 --> 55:36.753
Thank you, Dad.

55:55.480 --> 55:57.315
Beth! Over here!

55:57.315 --> 55:58.483
- Hi.
- Hi!

55:58.483 --> 55:59.484
I'm glad I caught you.

55:59.484 --> 56:00.902
We'll have to go somewhere else.

56:00.902 --> 56:02.112
Isn't this your office?

56:04.197 --> 56:05.198
Yes, absolutely.

56:05.198 --> 56:06.324
But you'll never
guess what happened.

56:06.324 --> 56:07.158
What?

56:08.493 --> 56:10.662
Oh, uh, roaches.
Total infestation.

56:10.662 --> 56:12.038
Crazy, huh?

56:12.038 --> 56:13.248
You know the kind of rent
they get for this place?

56:13.248 --> 56:14.541
And I asked specifically

56:14.541 --> 56:16.584
for an office
next to the cafeteria.

56:16.584 --> 56:18.003
Thought it'd be
convenient for clients.

56:18.003 --> 56:18.920
You know?

56:18.920 --> 56:20.922
But, listen, enough about that.

56:20.922 --> 56:22.590
Just wait
until you hear the news,

56:22.590 --> 56:23.800
you're not gonna believe it!

56:25.301 --> 56:26.261
You ready?

56:26.261 --> 56:27.387
Ready.

56:28.680 --> 56:30.181
I got you a national spot.

56:31.975 --> 56:33.601
What is a national spot?

56:33.601 --> 56:35.687
It's a TV commercial

56:35.687 --> 56:38.940
that will play on every set
in the country.

56:38.940 --> 56:40.525
You'll be everywhere.

56:40.525 --> 56:41.818
What would I be selling?

56:41.818 --> 56:43.319
Prosperity.

56:43.319 --> 56:46.114
It's a new
financial services company.

56:46.114 --> 56:49.284
They want a strong,
confident, working woman.

56:49.284 --> 56:51.161
Someone who you can trust
on how to handle your finances.

56:51.161 --> 56:52.996
Yeah, I don't know
if that's me.

56:52.996 --> 56:54.581
Well, they wanted
someone fresh...

56:54.581 --> 56:55.957
accessible.

56:55.957 --> 56:57.292
When I told them
I could get the "Flower Girl",

56:57.292 --> 56:58.585
they absolutely flipped.

56:58.585 --> 57:00.754
The agency guys
had seen you on TV.

57:00.754 --> 57:02.005
They said you'd be perfect.

57:02.005 --> 57:03.965
Okay. Would I be playing myself?

57:04.966 --> 57:06.301
You'd be playing
a version of yourself.

57:07.719 --> 57:10.930
Your character
is down to earth.

57:10.930 --> 57:12.432
The girl next door.

57:12.432 --> 57:13.475
Real.

57:13.475 --> 57:14.768
Natural.

57:14.768 --> 57:16.394
You're at a party.

57:16.394 --> 57:17.520
It's elegant...

57:17.520 --> 57:19.105
sophisticated.

57:19.105 --> 57:20.982
You're at the height
of your career

57:20.982 --> 57:23.318
as a professional woman.

57:23.318 --> 57:24.819
And that's when you tell
the audience

57:24.819 --> 57:27.238
you could do this forever.

57:28.490 --> 57:29.449
Or something like that.

57:29.449 --> 57:30.533
Yeah.

57:30.533 --> 57:31.451
Does that sound cool to you?

57:31.451 --> 57:33.703
Oh! I almost forgot...

57:33.703 --> 57:35.497
some paperwork
for the commercial.

57:35.497 --> 57:36.498
Oh, right. Right.

57:36.498 --> 57:37.457
Your contract.

57:39.793 --> 57:42.003
Oh. Um, can I actually
look this over first?

57:42.003 --> 57:43.838
Sure. Take your time.

57:43.838 --> 57:45.507
- Okay.
- It's a big opportunity.

57:45.507 --> 57:46.675
Could be life-changing.

57:46.675 --> 57:47.842
All right,
I'll let you know tomorrow.

57:47.842 --> 57:49.594
Make it first thing!

57:49.594 --> 57:51.388
They're waiting
for an answer.

58:02.190 --> 58:03.525
I mean,
it seems pretty standard.

58:03.525 --> 58:04.734
Boilerplate, mostly.

58:04.734 --> 58:06.695
Who can do what to who, and why.

58:06.695 --> 58:08.697
You think I should sign it?

58:08.697 --> 58:09.656
You're asking me?

58:09.656 --> 58:11.116
Mm-hmm.

58:11.116 --> 58:12.367
Wait, shouldn't you
ask your agent that?

58:12.367 --> 58:13.785
Oh, this...

58:13.785 --> 58:15.078
this is your agent.

58:15.078 --> 58:16.996
Correct.
There you go, Jake.

58:16.996 --> 58:18.248
Of course. Of course.

58:18.248 --> 58:19.457
It's, like,
tides and currents--

58:19.457 --> 58:21.042
that, I can do, but this...

58:21.042 --> 58:23.211
I just-- I don't wanna get in
over my head.

58:23.211 --> 58:25.380
When have you ever
been in over your head?

58:25.380 --> 58:27.090
Ooh, you haven't asked me
why I left L.A...

58:28.508 --> 58:29.384
Why did you?

58:31.011 --> 58:33.054
I was seeing this guy.

58:33.054 --> 58:35.223
He was smart, funny.

58:35.223 --> 58:36.558
Okay.

58:36.558 --> 58:37.559
Don't worry,
you're funnier.

58:37.559 --> 58:39.686
Thank you.

58:39.686 --> 58:41.813
He was an environmental lawyer.

58:41.813 --> 58:43.314
I was a witness
in one of his cases.

58:43.314 --> 58:44.649
And together,
we were gonna change the world.

58:47.485 --> 58:48.445
Did you?

58:49.904 --> 58:51.197
My world, maybe.

58:53.283 --> 58:54.617
Turns out, there was
a lot about himself

58:54.617 --> 58:56.244
he wasn't willing to share.

58:56.244 --> 58:57.704
Promises that were never kept.

59:00.123 --> 59:01.458
So what you see
isn't always what you get.

59:04.627 --> 59:05.628
I'm sorry.

59:05.628 --> 59:07.922
Oh... ancient water

59:07.922 --> 59:09.591
under a very,
very distant bridge.

59:12.635 --> 59:13.595
Should I trust this guy?

59:14.888 --> 59:16.348
Reveal my smiling face
to the world?

59:17.557 --> 59:19.225
I think you should do
whatever you wanna do.

59:20.852 --> 59:22.645
But if it helps,
I can tag along.

59:22.645 --> 59:23.855
- Oof.
- Keep you company.

59:23.855 --> 59:25.440
Please. Yes, thank you.

59:25.440 --> 59:26.900
Help me face the storm.

59:26.900 --> 59:28.526
Spoken like a true sailor.

59:28.526 --> 59:30.945
You know what? Actually,
there is one more thing.

59:30.945 --> 59:32.364
If you could just come here.

59:32.364 --> 59:33.490
Sure.

59:38.995 --> 59:40.080
What was that?

59:41.331 --> 59:42.874
It's what the fishermen's wives

59:42.874 --> 59:45.168
would do
before they went to sea.

59:45.168 --> 59:46.503
I mean, for good luck.

59:58.390 --> 59:59.724
That's it.
They're not coming.

59:59.724 --> 1:00:01.142
They said
they'd be here at 7:00.

1:00:01.142 --> 1:00:03.186
Sweetie pie, it's only 7:05.

1:00:03.186 --> 1:00:05.438
That is still considered early
for around here.

1:00:05.438 --> 1:00:07.190
Now, just relax
and have some tea.

1:00:07.190 --> 1:00:08.858
I'm just a galley wench
on a boat,

1:00:08.858 --> 1:00:10.026
I'm not a model.

1:00:12.570 --> 1:00:13.863
There's your ride.

1:00:13.863 --> 1:00:15.407
Now, remember what I said.

1:00:15.407 --> 1:00:17.117
You go out there
and show 'em

1:00:17.117 --> 1:00:18.827
what us Plimsolls are made of.

1:00:23.957 --> 1:00:24.833
Okay, bye, Aunt Dody!

1:00:24.833 --> 1:00:26.960
Hang on a second.

1:00:26.960 --> 1:00:28.294
- Good luck.
- Okay. Thank you.

1:00:30.839 --> 1:00:32.298
Oh! Thank you.

1:00:36.678 --> 1:00:38.054
My clients deserve the best.

1:00:38.054 --> 1:00:39.389
Somebody will come and get you

1:00:39.389 --> 1:00:41.766
when it's time for make-up,
hair and wardrobe.

1:00:41.766 --> 1:00:43.101
This... This is you.

1:00:45.186 --> 1:00:46.271
I get my own trailer?

1:00:46.271 --> 1:00:47.605
Yeah.

1:00:47.605 --> 1:00:49.065
That's so cool, thank you.

1:00:49.065 --> 1:00:50.650
Hey, you're gonna be great.

1:00:50.650 --> 1:00:51.735
Enjoy the moment.

1:00:51.735 --> 1:00:53.028
Break a leg.

1:00:53.028 --> 1:00:55.572
Oh, the girl in the picture!

1:00:55.572 --> 1:00:57.073
You're Shutter--

1:00:57.073 --> 1:00:58.074
Jake's friend.

1:00:58.074 --> 1:01:00.076
Do you know Jake?

1:01:00.076 --> 1:01:01.828
Sweetheart,
everyone knows Jake.

1:01:01.828 --> 1:01:03.204
I'll be back with your wardrobe

1:01:03.204 --> 1:01:04.497
once your hair and makeup
are done.

1:01:04.497 --> 1:01:05.457
Oh, okay.

1:01:18.553 --> 1:01:19.637
Um...

1:01:19.637 --> 1:01:20.680
Oh. Oh, don't worry.

1:01:20.680 --> 1:01:21.765
I'm not done yet.

1:01:21.765 --> 1:01:23.183
Oh.

1:01:35.487 --> 1:01:36.780
Janice!

1:01:36.780 --> 1:01:39.115
Hey... Jake.

1:01:39.115 --> 1:01:39.991
What are you doing here?

1:01:39.991 --> 1:01:41.659
Working.

1:01:41.659 --> 1:01:43.787
Oh, I met that "Flower Girl"
friend of yours.

1:01:46.581 --> 1:01:48.124
Yeah. How's she, uh...
How's she doing?

1:01:48.124 --> 1:01:49.501
Oh, she's loving it.

1:01:51.044 --> 1:01:52.504
Good. Good, I'm glad
to hear that.

1:01:52.504 --> 1:01:53.880
Yeah, I gotta go,

1:01:53.880 --> 1:01:55.632
but, uh, she should be done soon
if you stick around.

1:01:55.632 --> 1:01:56.633
Sure.

1:01:58.343 --> 1:01:59.427
- See you later, Janice.
- Mm-hmm!

1:01:59.427 --> 1:02:00.428
Okay.

1:02:10.146 --> 1:02:12.148
There she is, the star!

1:02:12.148 --> 1:02:14.317
Well, what do you think?

1:02:14.317 --> 1:02:17.570
I thought we were going
for real and natural.

1:02:17.570 --> 1:02:18.697
Oh, no, come on.

1:02:18.697 --> 1:02:21.574
You are, but in
a new and different way.

1:02:26.371 --> 1:02:27.747
Richie, this is not
what I signed up for.

1:02:27.747 --> 1:02:28.665
Oh, no, no, no.

1:02:28.665 --> 1:02:29.666
I-- I like it.

1:02:29.666 --> 1:02:30.667
And trust me...

1:02:30.667 --> 1:02:31.960
it gets better.

1:02:31.960 --> 1:02:33.545
Now, come on,
they want you on set.

1:02:57.861 --> 1:02:58.695
Richie, I'm so sorry.

1:02:58.695 --> 1:03:00.238
Whoa, whoa.
What's going on?

1:03:00.238 --> 1:03:01.489
They need you on set right now.

1:03:01.489 --> 1:03:02.657
I know. I know.
It's just-- It's too much.

1:03:02.657 --> 1:03:03.575
You're right.

1:03:03.575 --> 1:03:04.743
Trust me,

1:03:04.743 --> 1:03:06.077
I didn't know
that they would go so far.

1:03:06.077 --> 1:03:07.162
So let's just get you
back in the chair--

1:03:07.162 --> 1:03:08.580
No, no, no, no, no.
It isn't right.

1:03:08.580 --> 1:03:11.249
The hair. The makeup. The dress.
It just-- It isn't me.

1:03:11.249 --> 1:03:13.043
Look, why don't I talk
to the director,

1:03:13.043 --> 1:03:14.044
see what we can do?

1:03:14.044 --> 1:03:15.211
Does that sound cool to you?

1:03:15.211 --> 1:03:16.087
Richie, you're not
listening to me.

1:03:16.087 --> 1:03:17.505
I don't wanna do this anymore.

1:03:17.505 --> 1:03:18.715
Well, how do I fix the problem?
Work with me here.

1:03:18.715 --> 1:03:19.883
- Please, listen to me!
- Hey, Beth!

1:03:19.883 --> 1:03:21.343
I am listening to you.

1:03:21.343 --> 1:03:22.802
What's happening?

1:03:22.802 --> 1:03:24.179
Everything okay?

1:03:24.179 --> 1:03:25.555
Oh, everything's cool.

1:03:25.555 --> 1:03:26.598
We're just gonna get back--
back in her chair--

1:03:26.598 --> 1:03:27.640
Thank you,
just give us a minute.

1:03:29.184 --> 1:03:29.934
- Are you all right?
- Mm-mm.

1:03:31.436 --> 1:03:33.188
Okay, you wanna
get out of here?

1:03:33.188 --> 1:03:34.689
You don't have to do this.

1:03:34.689 --> 1:03:35.523
Hey, uh, guys,
we're a little pressed for time.

1:03:35.523 --> 1:03:36.441
Thank you.
I appreciate it.

1:03:36.441 --> 1:03:37.567
Let's get out of here.

1:03:37.567 --> 1:03:38.526
Hey, Shutterbot!

1:03:39.986 --> 1:03:41.029
You working this shoot, too?

1:03:42.364 --> 1:03:43.573
Shutterbot?

1:03:43.573 --> 1:03:45.283
We gotta do
that coffee sometime.

1:03:46.409 --> 1:03:48.119
You been holding out on me, man!

1:03:48.119 --> 1:03:49.412
I'm not asking you again!

1:03:49.412 --> 1:03:50.622
You're Shutterbot?

1:03:52.457 --> 1:03:54.084
I can explain everything,
if you just...

1:03:54.084 --> 1:03:55.085
you'll understand.

1:03:55.085 --> 1:03:56.294
I understand.

1:03:56.294 --> 1:03:57.921
You lied to me.

1:03:57.921 --> 1:03:59.089
Beth, where are you going?

1:03:59.089 --> 1:04:00.131
I'm going home!

1:04:00.131 --> 1:04:02.384
And you lied to me, too!

1:04:13.103 --> 1:04:14.104
Here, darling.

1:04:14.104 --> 1:04:15.313
Oh, thank you.

1:04:16.189 --> 1:04:18.775
Tough day?

1:04:18.775 --> 1:04:20.026
The worst, actually.

1:04:22.153 --> 1:04:23.238
You put yourself
out there today, darling.

1:04:23.238 --> 1:04:24.906
You tried.

1:04:24.906 --> 1:04:26.074
I'm proud of you for that.

1:04:26.074 --> 1:04:27.534
Really?

1:04:27.534 --> 1:04:28.576
Mm-hmm.

1:04:29.869 --> 1:04:32.247
You know, the grass
isn't always greener.

1:04:32.247 --> 1:04:33.331
And that's okay.

1:04:35.125 --> 1:04:36.376
Even if it hurts?

1:04:38.169 --> 1:04:39.337
Oh, one day,

1:04:39.337 --> 1:04:40.588
you will look back on this
and laugh.

1:04:40.588 --> 1:04:41.673
Wonder what the big deal was.

1:04:42.841 --> 1:04:45.385
Yeah, I wish
I hadn't gotten swept away.

1:04:45.385 --> 1:04:46.720
And that's okay, too.

1:04:50.306 --> 1:04:51.516
Thanks, Aunt Dody.
I love you.

1:04:52.851 --> 1:04:53.685
You'll be okay.

1:04:59.399 --> 1:05:00.608
All right.

1:05:00.608 --> 1:05:03.028
Well, it looks like
it's back to the salmon.

1:05:05.655 --> 1:05:07.699
Are you sure
you're gonna be okay?

1:05:07.699 --> 1:05:10.660
Oh, I've been okay
for a while now.

1:05:10.660 --> 1:05:12.287
It was just so wonderful
having you here,

1:05:12.287 --> 1:05:13.538
I haven't wanted to let on.

1:05:15.707 --> 1:05:16.666
Are you sure
you don't want to stay?

1:05:16.666 --> 1:05:18.335
Yeah.

1:05:18.335 --> 1:05:21.087
Yeah, I just wanna go home
where it's quiet,

1:05:21.087 --> 1:05:22.297
no one's lying to me,

1:05:22.297 --> 1:05:23.631
and I can be myself.

1:05:24.924 --> 1:05:25.759
Well, I don't blame you.

1:05:28.803 --> 1:05:32.098
And if anyone
should come looking for you?

1:05:32.098 --> 1:05:33.516
Um...

1:05:33.516 --> 1:05:35.352
Just tell them,
"She was here but she left."

1:05:35.352 --> 1:05:36.478
That's all anyone needs to know.

1:05:37.729 --> 1:05:39.272
Okay.

1:05:39.272 --> 1:05:40.648
Goodbye, darling.

1:05:40.648 --> 1:05:42.233
Bye.

1:05:42.233 --> 1:05:43.318
Thank you for everything.

1:05:43.318 --> 1:05:44.486
Take care.

1:06:10.887 --> 1:06:11.763
Hi! Is Beth home?

1:06:13.139 --> 1:06:16.142
No. Okay.

1:06:16.142 --> 1:06:17.727
Um...

1:06:17.727 --> 1:06:20.230
I've tried calling
and leaving messages.

1:06:20.230 --> 1:06:21.773
Um, could you do me a favor

1:06:21.773 --> 1:06:22.941
and please give her
these for me?

1:06:24.651 --> 1:06:26.569
I left my number
on the note.

1:06:26.569 --> 1:06:28.655
If you could please
get her to call me

1:06:28.655 --> 1:06:29.823
as soon she gets back,

1:06:29.823 --> 1:06:30.990
I'd appreciate it.

1:06:30.990 --> 1:06:32.409
Oh, dear Jacob.

1:06:32.409 --> 1:06:33.952
She isn't coming back.

1:06:33.952 --> 1:06:35.537
She went home.

1:06:37.205 --> 1:06:38.456
Home?

1:06:38.456 --> 1:06:39.791
Mm-hmm.
Back to the "Maria Elizabeth".

1:06:41.626 --> 1:06:43.294
I asked you
what your intentions were

1:06:43.294 --> 1:06:45.505
and you said
that they were honorable.

1:06:45.505 --> 1:06:46.923
And I believed you.

1:06:48.341 --> 1:06:50.510
But that wasn't exactly true,
was it?

1:06:52.137 --> 1:06:53.138
I understand.

1:06:53.138 --> 1:06:54.556
Believe me,

1:06:54.556 --> 1:06:55.932
this thing
was a big mistake.

1:06:58.476 --> 1:06:59.853
But I couldn't help but see her.

1:07:01.146 --> 1:07:02.564
Truly see her.

1:07:04.190 --> 1:07:05.275
And to be honest,

1:07:05.275 --> 1:07:06.609
I'm glad
that I'm not the only one.

1:07:08.778 --> 1:07:10.155
She's not just
a girl in a picture.

1:07:12.490 --> 1:07:14.409
I never thought
in a million years

1:07:14.409 --> 1:07:16.578
that I'd be lucky enough
to fall in love with her.

1:07:20.290 --> 1:07:22.000
I had high hopes for you, Jake.

1:07:25.086 --> 1:07:27.297
But she trusted you,

1:07:27.297 --> 1:07:28.131
and you betrayed her.

1:07:30.300 --> 1:07:31.551
Goodbye, Mr. Myer.

1:07:59.245 --> 1:08:00.538
So, um...

1:08:00.538 --> 1:08:02.540
I was thinking,

1:08:02.540 --> 1:08:04.793
maybe we could try
the narrows next time.

1:08:04.793 --> 1:08:06.252
I heard another skipper
on the radio

1:08:06.252 --> 1:08:07.837
talking about
how he was doing so well there.

1:08:09.005 --> 1:08:11.549
We could set the nets here,
and then just...

1:08:11.549 --> 1:08:12.967
drift with the tide.

1:08:12.967 --> 1:08:13.802
What do you think?

1:08:13.802 --> 1:08:15.095
Mm-hmm.

1:08:16.596 --> 1:08:18.056
Maybe we could try over here.

1:08:21.726 --> 1:08:22.936
Or maybe over here.

1:08:22.936 --> 1:08:24.604
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

1:08:24.604 --> 1:08:27.524
Or maybe we could just run
her aground on this island

1:08:27.524 --> 1:08:29.109
and chop her up for firewood?

1:08:30.652 --> 1:08:31.778
Mm. Mm-hmm.

1:10:08.875 --> 1:10:10.251
Hey, Dad.
Do you have a second?

1:10:10.251 --> 1:10:12.837
Sure, what's up?

1:10:12.837 --> 1:10:15.090
I was just looking over
the charts from last week,

1:10:15.090 --> 1:10:17.175
and I think we can make
a few adjustments.

1:10:17.175 --> 1:10:18.176
Okay.

1:10:24.557 --> 1:10:25.892
Hmm.

1:10:25.892 --> 1:10:28.186
I... I used to know this girl.

1:10:28.186 --> 1:10:29.688
Yeah.

1:10:29.688 --> 1:10:31.690
She was always joking around,
always smiling.

1:10:31.690 --> 1:10:33.775
Always sticking her nose
into things.

1:10:33.775 --> 1:10:35.068
Including the roses.

1:10:36.611 --> 1:10:38.071
I wonder whatever
happened to her?

1:10:39.572 --> 1:10:40.740
She went away
and never came back.

1:10:41.950 --> 1:10:43.201
Yeah?

1:10:43.201 --> 1:10:44.828
Well, I'd sure like
to find her again.

1:10:44.828 --> 1:10:46.955
You think maybe
she left her calling cod?

1:10:48.164 --> 1:10:49.416
If she did,
it wasn't on porpoise.

1:10:54.421 --> 1:10:55.880
You miss that boy, huh?

1:11:00.176 --> 1:11:01.261
He used me, Dad.

1:11:03.221 --> 1:11:04.889
He used me,
and then he lied to me.

1:11:05.932 --> 1:11:08.727
Yeah, that may be...

1:11:08.727 --> 1:11:13.231
but he also created
something beautiful...

1:11:13.231 --> 1:11:17.193
and anyone who can see you
in this way...

1:11:17.193 --> 1:11:19.571
the way
that I've always seen you...

1:11:19.571 --> 1:11:20.947
can't be all bad.

1:11:22.991 --> 1:11:24.117
It's good to be home, Dad.

1:11:25.744 --> 1:11:26.786
It's "Captain Dad" to you.

1:11:26.786 --> 1:11:28.496
Oh, right! Right.

1:11:28.496 --> 1:11:29.914
- Get it right.
- Won't happen again.

1:11:29.914 --> 1:11:31.124
- All right.
- All right, Captain Dad.

1:11:31.124 --> 1:11:32.417
Let's have a look at these...

1:11:32.417 --> 1:11:33.293
- Yeah.
- ...charts.

1:11:57.233 --> 1:11:58.485
Ohh...

1:12:10.914 --> 1:12:13.958
Say what you will...

1:12:13.958 --> 1:12:15.835
that boy has an eye for beauty.

1:12:24.386 --> 1:12:25.637
Aunt Dody.

1:12:25.637 --> 1:12:26.763
Hello, Jacob.

1:12:26.763 --> 1:12:28.640
Please, won't you join me?

1:12:28.640 --> 1:12:30.266
Absolutely.

1:12:30.266 --> 1:12:32.560
It was most considerate of you
to meet me on such short notice.

1:12:33.770 --> 1:12:34.854
Of course.

1:12:34.854 --> 1:12:36.272
It sounded urgent.

1:12:36.272 --> 1:12:39.317
Well, maybe not as urgent
as all that,

1:12:39.317 --> 1:12:42.320
but it seems that
I do have something of yours.

1:12:42.320 --> 1:12:43.196
This just came.

1:12:45.824 --> 1:12:47.117
Look familiar?

1:12:51.538 --> 1:12:52.580
How did she find this?

1:12:52.580 --> 1:12:54.374
So you didn't send it?

1:12:55.583 --> 1:12:57.627
No. No, it, uh...

1:12:57.627 --> 1:12:58.545
this wasn't me.

1:13:01.965 --> 1:13:04.217
So it was her.

1:13:04.217 --> 1:13:05.468
Wow.

1:13:05.468 --> 1:13:06.803
I guess when you want
something bad enough,

1:13:06.803 --> 1:13:08.221
you just keep looking until,

1:13:08.221 --> 1:13:10.890
eventually,
you manage to find it.

1:13:12.183 --> 1:13:14.394
Jacob, this creates
a huge problem for me.

1:13:14.394 --> 1:13:15.645
It does?

1:13:15.645 --> 1:13:17.313
It most certainly does.

1:13:17.313 --> 1:13:19.733
How exactly am I supposed
to get that to her?

1:13:19.733 --> 1:13:22.152
Have you ever tried to have
something delivered to a boat?

1:13:23.987 --> 1:13:25.530
Impossible.

1:13:25.530 --> 1:13:27.157
You might as well try
to deliver it via flying fish.

1:13:29.242 --> 1:13:31.995
So...

1:13:31.995 --> 1:13:35.373
I was wondering if maybe...

1:13:35.373 --> 1:13:36.583
you might be willing
to deliver it.

1:13:39.794 --> 1:13:41.129
- You want me to do what?
- Deliver it.

1:13:41.129 --> 1:13:42.547
In person.
The directions are there.

1:13:43.923 --> 1:13:45.008
Might wanna bring along
your camera,

1:13:45.008 --> 1:13:46.176
there's some beautiful country
up there.

1:13:49.471 --> 1:13:52.349
What makes you think
that she'll even see me?

1:13:52.349 --> 1:13:55.602
Well, I guess that all depends
on who shows up.

1:13:55.602 --> 1:13:58.271
A sensitive young man
with an eye for beauty,

1:13:58.271 --> 1:14:00.732
or a scandal-sniffing
Hollywood type

1:14:00.732 --> 1:14:02.400
who's just in it
for a quick buck?

1:14:04.569 --> 1:14:05.445
Thank you.

1:14:07.614 --> 1:14:08.573
Good luck.

1:14:13.328 --> 1:14:14.496
Candace, hi!

1:14:14.496 --> 1:14:16.247
You barely caught me,
I'm just headed out.

1:14:16.247 --> 1:14:18.375
Jake, something
wonderful's happened.

1:14:18.375 --> 1:14:19.459
<i>Oh, yeah?</i>

1:14:19.459 --> 1:14:20.418
How soon can you get here?

1:14:20.418 --> 1:14:21.586
Not soon.

1:14:21.586 --> 1:14:22.962
What do you mean?
You mean now?

1:14:22.962 --> 1:14:24.297
I mean right now.

1:14:26.549 --> 1:14:27.759
Why? What's up?

1:14:27.759 --> 1:14:28.927
I can't say,

1:14:28.927 --> 1:14:30.261
but someone important said,

1:14:30.261 --> 1:14:31.638
"Get me the guy
who shot that photo."

1:14:41.106 --> 1:14:43.358
So, you're
the infamous Shutterbot.

1:14:43.358 --> 1:14:45.068
Jake. Jake Myer.

1:14:45.068 --> 1:14:46.069
It's good
to finally meet you, Jake.

1:14:46.069 --> 1:14:47.445
Thanks for coming by.

1:14:47.445 --> 1:14:49.114
Yeah, of course.

1:14:51.491 --> 1:14:52.742
Please, have a seat.

1:14:52.742 --> 1:14:54.244
Sure. Anywhere?

1:14:57.539 --> 1:14:59.124
I'm Vern Valene.
Huge fan.

1:14:59.124 --> 1:15:00.875
Always loved your work.

1:15:00.875 --> 1:15:02.627
Now, you may not know it,

1:15:02.627 --> 1:15:04.379
but you're a very important guy
around here these days.

1:15:05.630 --> 1:15:07.132
I am?

1:15:07.132 --> 1:15:08.216
That one issue

1:15:08.216 --> 1:15:09.801
has generated
more online traffic

1:15:09.801 --> 1:15:11.177
than anything we've published.

1:15:11.177 --> 1:15:12.303
Ever.

1:15:12.303 --> 1:15:14.305
And more traffic
means more advertising.

1:15:14.305 --> 1:15:16.933
Ad placements are up
by a third this month alone.

1:15:16.933 --> 1:15:18.268
Your "Flower Girl"

1:15:18.268 --> 1:15:21.229
has been shared, linked, pinned,
liked, and dug

1:15:21.229 --> 1:15:22.981
more times
than anything we've ever run.

1:15:22.981 --> 1:15:24.566
Her name's Beth.

1:15:24.566 --> 1:15:26.026
Right, Beth.

1:15:27.277 --> 1:15:28.987
Anyway, here's the deal.

1:15:28.987 --> 1:15:30.572
Based on the response,

1:15:30.572 --> 1:15:33.116
we've decided to devote
an entire issue to you.

1:15:34.534 --> 1:15:36.202
It's about time your talent gets
the recognition it deserves.

1:15:38.371 --> 1:15:39.539
If only someone had said
something sooner.

1:15:43.668 --> 1:15:44.544
Wow, a-- a whole issue.

1:15:44.544 --> 1:15:45.712
To me?

1:15:45.712 --> 1:15:47.005
To your work.

1:15:47.005 --> 1:15:48.214
Yeah, we'll pick a day.

1:15:48.214 --> 1:15:49.966
Turn you loose.
Let you do your thing.

1:15:49.966 --> 1:15:53.219
An entire issue
dedicated to Shutterbot.

1:15:55.722 --> 1:15:56.556
Shutterbot's retired.

1:16:00.226 --> 1:16:01.644
Then maybe you can do it
as you.

1:16:02.771 --> 1:16:03.897
Exactly.

1:16:03.897 --> 1:16:04.814
You can do it
as whoever you want.

1:16:06.066 --> 1:16:07.067
The important thing is

1:16:07.067 --> 1:16:08.360
that you're the guy

1:16:08.360 --> 1:16:10.195
that captured the shot
of this magnificent girl.

1:16:11.446 --> 1:16:13.073
And that's
what people wanna see.

1:16:15.533 --> 1:16:17.160
So, what do you say?

1:16:22.499 --> 1:16:24.084
<i>This is a huge opportunity.</i>

1:16:24.084 --> 1:16:26.461
Jake, this is everything
you've ever really wanted.

1:16:26.461 --> 1:16:28.129
You're right.
You're absolutely right.

1:16:28.129 --> 1:16:29.756
Then why did you put him off?

1:16:29.756 --> 1:16:30.632
He wants you
to start right away.

1:16:30.632 --> 1:16:31.466
What do I tell him?

1:16:33.093 --> 1:16:34.594
Tell him
I gotta do something first.

1:16:35.845 --> 1:16:38.807
I hurt somebody very special.

1:16:38.807 --> 1:16:40.225
I need to make that right.

1:16:40.225 --> 1:16:42.394
I hope you know
what you're doing.

1:16:42.394 --> 1:16:44.437
Vern's offer
isn't gonna last forever.

1:16:45.605 --> 1:16:46.898
I know.

1:16:46.898 --> 1:16:48.692
Thank you, Candace.

1:16:48.692 --> 1:16:49.818
I appreciate it a lot.

Are you expecting someone?

No, why?

1:17:32.527 --> 1:17:34.529
Looks like
someone's expecting you.

1:17:44.664 --> 1:17:45.999
Impossible.

1:17:45.999 --> 1:17:47.542
Nah.

1:17:47.542 --> 1:17:49.461
Nothing's impossible
these days.

1:17:52.505 --> 1:17:54.174
Go on.

1:17:54.174 --> 1:17:55.800
Go and show him
how a real sailor does it.

1:18:15.070 --> 1:18:15.862
Where's your camera?

1:18:17.197 --> 1:18:18.656
Packed away.

1:18:18.656 --> 1:18:21.409
No one lurking
up there on the dock?

1:18:23.203 --> 1:18:24.621
No. Just me.

1:18:26.206 --> 1:18:27.248
What's in there?

1:18:33.963 --> 1:18:34.881
I found a copy.

1:18:34.881 --> 1:18:36.257
Yeah.

1:18:37.342 --> 1:18:38.510
Apparently, my mother

1:18:38.510 --> 1:18:39.636
wasn't the only one
who had one after all.

1:18:42.514 --> 1:18:44.057
Did you come all the way
out here just to give me that?

1:18:44.057 --> 1:18:45.892
It was Dody's idea.

1:18:45.892 --> 1:18:47.185
She insisted.

1:18:47.185 --> 1:18:48.770
She said if I didn't come,

1:18:48.770 --> 1:18:51.064
that, uh, she'd have to use
a flying fish.

1:18:51.064 --> 1:18:52.232
Mm.

1:18:52.232 --> 1:18:53.108
Classic Dody.

1:18:53.108 --> 1:18:54.734
Yeah.

1:18:56.778 --> 1:18:58.071
You really didn't have to go
through all that trouble

1:18:58.071 --> 1:18:59.239
to find that.

1:18:59.239 --> 1:19:00.657
I know, but I wanted to.

1:19:02.909 --> 1:19:04.327
I didn't mean to hurt you.

1:19:04.327 --> 1:19:05.787
Please believe that.

1:19:06.996 --> 1:19:07.956
I get that you believe that.

1:19:10.792 --> 1:19:12.085
Would it help if, um,

1:19:12.085 --> 1:19:13.128
I told you...

1:19:13.128 --> 1:19:14.587
Hey, first mate!

1:19:14.587 --> 1:19:16.006
You, uh...

1:19:16.006 --> 1:19:17.674
You planning on snubbing up
that line anytime soon,

1:19:17.674 --> 1:19:19.718
before we drift
back out to sea?

1:19:19.718 --> 1:19:20.885
What are you
talking about, Dad?

1:19:20.885 --> 1:19:22.429
She's secure.

1:19:23.847 --> 1:19:25.098
Hey, you...

1:19:25.098 --> 1:19:26.057
young man.

1:19:26.057 --> 1:19:27.392
Yes, sir.

1:19:27.392 --> 1:19:29.394
Be advised,
distracting a crew member

1:19:29.394 --> 1:19:30.770
and interfering

1:19:30.770 --> 1:19:33.398
with the safe operation
of a commercial vessel

1:19:33.398 --> 1:19:35.108
is a serious crime.

1:19:35.108 --> 1:19:37.193
Punishable by, uh...

1:19:37.193 --> 1:19:38.695
dinner.

1:19:41.990 --> 1:19:43.074
Aye, aye, captain.

1:19:59.466 --> 1:20:00.592
I don't get it.

1:20:02.010 --> 1:20:03.470
Why didn't you just tell me?

1:20:04.679 --> 1:20:06.431
I wanted to.

1:20:06.431 --> 1:20:08.391
I even tried to.

1:20:10.185 --> 1:20:11.478
I was afraid

1:20:11.478 --> 1:20:12.562
that if you knew
about Shutterbot,

1:20:12.562 --> 1:20:14.189
that it would
change everything.

1:20:14.189 --> 1:20:15.857
And how long were you planning
on stringing me along for?

1:20:19.778 --> 1:20:20.945
I guess
until you knew me well enough

1:20:20.945 --> 1:20:21.738
that it wouldn't matter.

1:20:23.531 --> 1:20:26.493
Jake, I knew you well enough
from the moment I saw you.

1:20:30.246 --> 1:20:32.582
So...

1:20:32.582 --> 1:20:34.084
how long you think
you can stay for?

1:20:35.752 --> 1:20:36.878
At least until
I run out of film.

1:20:38.380 --> 1:20:39.839
I got a lot of film.

1:20:39.839 --> 1:20:42.926
Well, unfortunately,
that is not gonna take you long.

1:20:42.926 --> 1:20:44.052
You can point your camera
in any direction

1:20:44.052 --> 1:20:45.053
and see something beautiful.

1:20:47.055 --> 1:20:48.014
I noticed that.

1:20:48.014 --> 1:20:49.557
No, not me,
the scenic beauty.

1:20:49.557 --> 1:20:50.767
I noticed that, too.

1:20:53.269 --> 1:20:54.771
It's good for me here.

1:20:56.898 --> 1:21:00.235
It's not glamorous,
I know, but...

1:21:00.235 --> 1:21:01.653
this is where I belong.

1:21:04.155 --> 1:21:05.407
You're beautiful
wherever you are.

1:21:07.534 --> 1:21:08.535
And wherever you are...

1:21:08.535 --> 1:21:10.412
that's where I wanna be.

1:21:14.082 --> 1:21:15.208
I don't know how it happened.

1:21:15.208 --> 1:21:17.377
Somehow...

1:21:17.377 --> 1:21:19.462
I managed to capture
all of you...

1:21:19.462 --> 1:21:21.548
in that one photo.

1:21:23.091 --> 1:21:24.968
Your courage.

1:21:24.968 --> 1:21:25.927
Your kindness.

1:21:25.927 --> 1:21:28.430
Your soul.

1:21:28.430 --> 1:21:30.306
You made me want to be
an artist again,

1:21:30.306 --> 1:21:31.516
just by being you.

1:21:33.643 --> 1:21:34.936
Wow...

1:21:34.936 --> 1:21:38.064
that's pretty sweet-talking
for a city slicker.

1:21:38.064 --> 1:21:38.940
I was laying it on thick.

1:21:38.940 --> 1:21:40.191
- Yeah.
- Too much?

1:21:40.191 --> 1:21:41.568
No, I liked it.

1:21:43.945 --> 1:21:45.780
You think you could learn
how to trust me again?

1:21:48.450 --> 1:21:50.243
You know what they say?

1:21:50.243 --> 1:21:54.080
They say, "Time and tide
wait for no man."

1:21:54.080 --> 1:21:55.498
And if these past few weeks
have taught me anything,

1:21:55.498 --> 1:21:57.417
it's that we really have no idea

1:21:57.417 --> 1:21:59.461
what could possibly
happen tomorrow.

1:22:01.212 --> 1:22:03.590
But...

1:22:03.590 --> 1:22:06.259
being with you
makes me so excited

1:22:06.259 --> 1:22:08.303
