WEBVTT

00:50.384 --> 00:53.533
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

01:18.209 --> 01:20.414
M'GANN: Okay, Garfield,
you called this meeting.

01:20.415 --> 01:23.149
And I appreciate
you hearing me out.

01:23.149 --> 01:26.620
Kaldur, though
the Justice League ranks
are divided,

01:26.620 --> 01:29.221
you stand center-stage
defending a world

01:29.221 --> 01:32.456
seemingly committed
to stopping your good works.

01:32.459 --> 01:35.796
And, M'gann, you lead the team
against our adversaries

01:35.796 --> 01:37.697
while avoiding the spotlight.

01:37.730 --> 01:39.364
Despite all obstacles,

01:39.399 --> 01:41.268
you're both
making a difference.

01:42.233 --> 01:43.569
But something is missing.

01:44.870 --> 01:47.406
Okay, I'll bite.
What?

01:47.441 --> 01:49.376
A public version of the team.

01:49.409 --> 01:51.510
Young heroes rebelling
against the system

01:51.545 --> 01:54.614
to fight the good fight
in clear view.

01:54.647 --> 01:57.349
No, we do not put
those kinds of targets

01:57.384 --> 01:58.885
on our underage heroes.

01:58.918 --> 02:00.819
That is what
the Justice League is for.

02:00.852 --> 02:02.656
The League can't do
what we need

02:02.688 --> 02:05.191
because you're playing
on the Light's game board.

02:05.191 --> 02:07.427
Have you seen
the headlines lately?

02:07.459 --> 02:10.295
Lex Luthor's grip
on the United Nation,

02:10.330 --> 02:12.230
the public fear
of meta-humans,

02:12.264 --> 02:14.334
meta-teen trafficking.

02:14.335 --> 02:16.804
Bad guys like Granny Goodness
and Baron Bedlam

02:16.805 --> 02:19.372
are capitalizing on all of it.

02:19.372 --> 02:20.806
We've lost
the hearts and minds

02:20.807 --> 02:23.310
of the people
we're trying to protect.

02:23.342 --> 02:25.544
Demagogues and fearmongers
have caused folks

02:25.579 --> 02:27.545
to give up
on the heroic ideal,

02:27.580 --> 02:31.251
the reason the Justice League
was formed in the first place.

02:31.251 --> 02:33.718
Great, now I'm
thoroughly depressed.

02:33.752 --> 02:36.389
Don't worry,
I've got you covered.

02:36.389 --> 02:39.292
See, we're gonna
break the rules
the League can't.

02:39.293 --> 02:40.759
We're gonna connect
with people

02:40.762 --> 02:43.229
in ways that can't be
blocked by governments.

02:43.263 --> 02:45.365
We're gonna quiet
the fears of the public

02:45.396 --> 02:47.300
terrified by
the meta-gene generation.

02:47.334 --> 02:50.301
And we'll do it all
by inspiring that generation,

02:50.336 --> 02:51.837
because we are them,

02:51.872 --> 02:53.438
raised alongside them

02:53.438 --> 02:55.807
in the fallout
of a scary meta-human world.

02:55.842 --> 02:59.579
We can be the heroes
that empower them
to conquer their fears.

02:59.611 --> 03:02.449
That's a great speech,
Gar, sincerely.

03:02.480 --> 03:06.485
But how's that any different
from what the League's
trying to do now?

03:06.520 --> 03:08.788
The League and the Light
are fighting spin campaigns,

03:08.822 --> 03:10.323
and the Light's winning.

03:10.355 --> 03:12.292
That's not
what I'm talking about.

03:12.324 --> 03:13.393
Look at this.

03:13.425 --> 03:14.860
Without even trying,

03:14.895 --> 03:17.395
these actions have generated
something organic,

03:17.430 --> 03:18.866
something beyond spin.

03:18.899 --> 03:20.467
Something that can ever emerge

03:20.500 --> 03:22.870
from under the thumb
of Luthor or Granny.

03:22.901 --> 03:24.569
It's something relatable.

03:24.604 --> 03:26.337
It's something we can build on

03:26.372 --> 03:28.675
by giving people something
they can brand,

03:28.709 --> 03:31.044
something they can own
on social media,

03:31.078 --> 03:33.881
something that makes them
part of the story.

03:33.913 --> 03:36.717
We're gonna be highly mobile
and accessible.

03:36.750 --> 03:40.652
And together, we're gonna
start a revolution.

03:40.687 --> 03:41.989
A... A small one, anyway.

03:42.020 --> 03:43.889
You have given us
much to consider.

03:43.924 --> 03:46.174
No, we haven't.

03:51.663 --> 03:54.633
Get on board
or get out of the way.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.603
-(GRUNTS)
-You all heard the story.

03:56.637 --> 03:57.937
You guys built this team?

03:57.972 --> 03:59.872
It's time to take it
to the next level.

03:59.907 --> 04:02.542
Are you sure you're ready
for this kind of spotlight?

04:02.574 --> 04:04.676
Green skin, can't hide.

04:04.711 --> 04:06.680
The Reach outed me
two years ago.

04:06.711 --> 04:08.882
Kid Flash is out too
from back in Wally's day.

04:08.914 --> 04:11.085
Public doesn't always get
that I'm a different guy.

04:11.085 --> 04:13.453
Plus, I never really grew out
of the whole secret ID thing
anyway. You?

04:13.485 --> 04:16.824
Markovia and the world
already know what I've become.

04:16.857 --> 04:19.793
Now I want to show them
who I have become.

04:19.826 --> 04:21.360
And there was no way

04:21.360 --> 04:23.528
I was gonna let this be
a no-girl squad.

04:23.562 --> 04:24.963
The group
needed a little color.

04:24.999 --> 04:27.500
Hey, brown skin here.

04:27.533 --> 04:30.036
-Might as well be blue skin
with that face plate.
-(CLANKS)

04:31.471 --> 04:33.007
And the rest of you?

04:33.040 --> 04:35.074
Not ready. Not yet.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.910
That's just fine.

04:36.944 --> 04:39.680
I was afraid I was
losing my entire team.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.848
And I'm guessing
we're too old.

04:41.882 --> 04:43.016
(CHUCKLES)

04:43.050 --> 04:45.384
Wow, when did that happen?

04:45.418 --> 04:48.454
Huh. So it is decided.

04:48.487 --> 04:52.793
The covert team will now
consist of Miss Martian,
Superboy, Tigress,

04:52.826 --> 04:55.129
Halo, 13, Forager,
and Tara.

04:55.161 --> 04:58.365
While Beast Boy will lead
Wonder Girl, Blue Beetle,

04:58.398 --> 05:00.600
Kid Flash, Static,
and Geo-Force

05:00.634 --> 05:02.668
in this new public squad.

05:02.670 --> 05:05.805
But still, covertly answer
to the League
through Miss Martian.

05:05.838 --> 05:07.040
Agreed?

05:07.074 --> 05:08.675
Agreed.

05:08.675 --> 05:10.911
Oh, and there's one more thing
I got covered.

05:12.713 --> 05:15.115
Welcome
to the premier building,

05:15.149 --> 05:18.418
the new squad's
base of operations.

05:18.451 --> 05:20.786
I call this the Hub.

05:20.821 --> 05:23.088
Holographic computer
interface,

05:23.122 --> 05:25.492
secured link
to Watchtower systems.

05:25.524 --> 05:27.526
Basically, our mission room.

05:27.560 --> 05:29.028
When not in service,

05:29.062 --> 05:31.665
it'll double as our
super stylin' living space.

05:31.697 --> 05:33.432
KID FLASH: This is so crash!

05:33.432 --> 05:35.201
BEAST BOY: And whether
you're with the squad or not,

05:35.201 --> 05:37.071
there's enough space
upstairs for me,

05:37.071 --> 05:40.000
Brion, Tara, Violet,
Vic, and Fred,

05:40.007 --> 05:42.408
to have our separate bedrooms.

05:42.442 --> 05:43.843
BLUE BEETLE: Finally!

05:43.877 --> 05:45.812
I mean, thank you.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.112
BEAST BOY: Got you covered, B.

05:47.146 --> 05:49.016
FORAGER: Ooh.
(MUNCHING)

05:49.048 --> 05:51.483
BEAST BOY: And if
anyone's hungry,
got that covered too.

05:51.516 --> 05:53.019
And just like Mount Justice,

05:53.052 --> 05:55.487
we'll eventually
have a medical bay,

05:55.521 --> 05:57.490
a science lab, a gym,

05:57.524 --> 05:59.593
even a Zeta Tube.

05:59.625 --> 06:03.430
Wow, it really is starting
to feel like the Cave
back in the day.

06:03.463 --> 06:04.831
But, um... (CLEARS THROAT)

06:04.865 --> 06:06.432
Who's paying for all this?

06:06.466 --> 06:08.834
Ha, Gretchen Goode.

06:08.869 --> 06:11.502
She might still have me
locked into a contract,

06:11.504 --> 06:14.240
but that means old Granny
has to pay me,

06:14.240 --> 06:17.211
enough to finance the mission
to take her down.

06:17.244 --> 06:19.579
Now that's what
I call payback.

06:19.612 --> 06:21.148
Huh? Huh?

06:21.180 --> 06:23.649
Yeah, this is a sympathy bump.

06:23.682 --> 06:26.586
GEO-FORCE: The bedrooms
are quite spacious.

06:26.620 --> 06:30.523
I must say, I will not miss
the confines of the bio RV.

06:30.557 --> 06:31.790
(WHIMPERS QUESTIONINGLY)

06:33.225 --> 06:36.129
The new place is great, Gar.

06:36.163 --> 06:39.132
But there's no way
six teenagers
are gonna live here

06:39.165 --> 06:41.500
alone and unsupervised.

06:41.535 --> 06:43.836
Yeah, who knows
what might happen.

06:43.870 --> 06:45.004
(SNICKERS) Ow!

06:45.038 --> 06:46.473
Behave.

06:46.504 --> 06:48.141
I would be happy,

06:48.141 --> 06:51.911
honored to move in
and act as a den mother.

06:51.944 --> 06:53.947
I'm already working
with Victor,

06:53.947 --> 06:56.516
so it would help
to stay close to him.

06:56.550 --> 06:59.086
Plus, I've been
living in a hotel
for the last four months,

06:59.086 --> 07:01.889
and, well, it's not for me.

07:01.889 --> 07:04.490
That would be
a tremendous help, Helga.

07:04.524 --> 07:05.790
Thank you.

07:05.826 --> 07:07.826
Got a bedroom with
your name on it, Doc.

07:07.860 --> 07:09.163
Well, uh, not yet,

07:09.196 --> 07:11.798
but let me get a pen
and an index card.

07:11.831 --> 07:13.165
(LAUGHS)

07:13.199 --> 07:15.668
It'll be so nice
to finally be together.

07:15.701 --> 07:17.237
Like a family.

07:17.271 --> 07:20.740
I doubt any of us will
miss our prior accommodations.

07:21.540 --> 07:23.040
(WHIMPERS)

07:34.088 --> 07:35.189
Evening, Gaby.

07:35.221 --> 07:36.689
Need a lift home?

07:36.723 --> 07:38.125
No, thanks, Sheriff Maguire.

07:38.158 --> 07:40.526
I was just on my way
to study with Big Words.

07:40.560 --> 07:42.829
-I mean Antonia.
-(WHOOSHING)

07:42.862 --> 07:43.862
Get down!

07:46.899 --> 07:49.603
(GROANS) What... What is that?

07:49.636 --> 07:54.636
I don't know.
We're getting out of here.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.819
Gar, take a look at this.

08:10.223 --> 08:12.725
<i>It just showed up
and started shooting.</i>

08:12.759 --> 08:15.129
<i>If anyone's seeing this,
please send help.</i>

08:15.161 --> 08:17.629
<i>Send...</i>
(SCREAMS)

08:17.663 --> 08:19.333
Is that a Reach ship?

08:19.365 --> 08:20.600
Sure looks like one.

08:20.634 --> 08:22.836
This is so loaded.

08:22.869 --> 08:24.571
Oh, man, this could be it.

08:24.603 --> 08:26.038
I'm hitting the Troub-Alert.

08:26.072 --> 08:28.108
(ALARM BLARING)

08:28.975 --> 08:30.610
Mother of God,

08:30.610 --> 08:32.644
that ridiculous alarm
is even louder up here!

08:32.677 --> 08:35.282
Dude, this better not be
another Troub-Alert drill.

08:35.316 --> 08:37.149
No drill, the Reach are back.

08:37.182 --> 08:38.585
No, just no.

08:38.618 --> 08:39.918
M'GANN: Hold up.

08:39.918 --> 08:41.187
Looks like the League's
already on it.

08:41.187 --> 08:42.221
GABY:
<i>Someone's here.</i>

08:42.254 --> 08:47.056
<i>I think it's... Aquaman?</i>

<i>Aquaman's okay!</i>

<i>Chill, Aquaman,
we got you covered.</i>

<i>Wow, it's Kid Flash.</i>

09:18.292 --> 09:19.926
<i>And there's Blue Beetle.</i>

I think that's Garfield Logan!</i>

<i>Blue, can you confirm they're Reach?</i>

09:38.211 --> 09:39.644
Scarab confirms it.

09:39.677 --> 09:41.014
I can deactivate them
on contact.

09:41.048 --> 09:43.216
But only one at a time.

09:59.831 --> 10:02.403
Uh... Oh! Gratitude.

10:02.436 --> 10:04.104
Um, stay calm, citizen,

10:04.138 --> 10:06.740
and stay inside
while we swat these bugs.

10:09.774 --> 10:12.446
Well, I'll be
super-amalgamated.

you must get to cover.

another one away.
