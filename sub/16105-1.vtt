01:58.006 --> 02:00.806
A little girl goes missing.

02:00.841 --> 02:03.772
The pack salivates.

02:03.807 --> 02:07.453
If it bleeds, it leads, right?

02:07.488 --> 02:12.288
Eddie Dunford, Crime Correspondent,
back home to take the North.

02:15.929 --> 02:17.534
Business first.

02:17.569 --> 02:19.169
Dad won't mind waiting.

02:27.451 --> 02:28.896
Edward.

02:28.931 --> 02:30.616
Sorry to hear about your father.

02:30.651 --> 02:33.612
Thank you, Mr Hadley.
He had a good innings, eh?

02:34.732 --> 02:36.372
This is Detective
Superintendent Jobson.

02:36.407 --> 02:37.377
Oh, right.

02:37.412 --> 02:39.378
Pleasure, sir. Pleasure to meet you.

02:39.413 --> 02:42.613
Mr Dunford's hoping to be the
Post's new Crime Correspondent.

02:42.648 --> 02:45.294
I always got along well
with Jack Whitehead...

02:45.329 --> 02:46.899
Good old Jack, eh?

02:46.934 --> 02:49.174
He'll be standing in
for a trial period.

02:49.209 --> 02:50.380
All right.

02:50.415 --> 02:52.895
Pleasure to meet you and... er...

02:52.930 --> 02:54.660
To work.

02:54.695 --> 02:56.421
Is he a local lad?

02:56.456 --> 02:58.856
Cut his teeth on our Yorkshire Post.

02:58.891 --> 03:00.673
But he's been down South.

03:00.708 --> 03:02.422
Young Turk, then, eh?

03:02.457 --> 03:05.257
Made a pig's ear of it
from what I understand.

03:05.292 --> 03:07.097
Given him a month
to prove himself.

03:08.738 --> 03:10.378
So, where's Whitehead?

03:10.413 --> 03:11.743
Jack?

03:11.778 --> 03:13.463
On the piss probably.

03:13.498 --> 03:16.459
Don't worry, son, you got
your legs well under the table.

03:16.494 --> 03:17.944
Just do the job.

03:17.979 --> 03:20.580
I know. Fuck him.
He's not getting in on this one.

03:20.615 --> 03:23.180
Yeah, funeral's in two hours.
It's going to be tight.

03:23.215 --> 03:24.837
We'll make it.

03:24.872 --> 03:26.425
Aye up, Owl's on.

03:26.460 --> 03:28.781
Gentlemen, we'll keep this brief.

03:30.421 --> 03:33.987
At 4.00pm yesterday evening,
3rd September, Clare Kemplay

03:34.022 --> 03:37.542
disappeared on her way home from
Morley Grange Junior and Infants.

03:37.577 --> 03:39.988
Clare is ten years old.

03:40.023 --> 03:42.988
She was wearing a red anorak,

03:43.023 --> 03:45.989
grey school uniform,
and red Wellington boots.

03:46.024 --> 03:50.144
Mrs Kemplay would now like to
read a short statement. Thank you.

03:50.179 --> 03:51.790
Poor cow.

03:51.825 --> 03:53.790
I know, do you reckon Dad did it?

03:53.825 --> 03:57.706
I'd like to appeal to anyone
who knows where my Clare is

03:57.741 --> 04:00.306
or who saw her after
yesterday teatime

04:00.341 --> 04:03.284
to please contact the police.

04:03.319 --> 04:06.227
Clare is a very happy girl...

04:07.827 --> 04:09.673
.. and I know she would just...

04:09.708 --> 04:12.148
never just run off
without telling me.

04:13.748 --> 04:15.909
Please, if you know where she is...

04:15.944 --> 04:18.509
Please, she's...

04:19.349 --> 04:21.870
Sorry...

04:24.750 --> 04:26.910
All right, lads, that's your lot.

04:41.233 --> 04:42.873
Oh, oh, darling.

04:42.908 --> 04:44.478
Mum. I'm sorry.

04:44.513 --> 04:46.314
I'm really sorry I'm late.

04:47.954 --> 04:50.434
"Business before pleasure,"
he always said.

04:50.469 --> 04:52.755
She means Dad. Remember dad?

04:56.795 --> 05:00.076
He were Yorkshire's
finest tailor, William was.

05:00.111 --> 05:01.961
He was a good lad, your dad.

05:01.996 --> 05:04.156
You knew where you were with him.

05:04.191 --> 05:05.642
Reliable.

05:05.677 --> 05:10.157
Well, now! "Edward Dunford, North
of England Crime Correspondent.

05:10.192 --> 05:13.838
"Mrs Sandra Kemplay made an
emotional plea this morning... "

05:13.873 --> 05:15.675
"Did you write that, love?

05:15.710 --> 05:17.444
Our new Byline Boy, is Eddie.

05:17.479 --> 05:19.239
You'll be wanting
his autograph next.

05:19.274 --> 05:20.964
He'll always be Little Eddie to me.

05:20.999 --> 05:24.480
It's a step up, lad. Pity
your dad's not here to see it.

05:24.515 --> 05:27.645
Hey, is that one of his?

05:27.680 --> 05:30.401
This, er, no.
This is Lord John, Carnaby Street.

05:30.436 --> 05:32.286
Oh, aye.

05:32.321 --> 05:34.922
It doesn't look good, does it?
This Kemplay lass.

05:34.957 --> 05:36.887
24 hours and not a thing.

05:36.922 --> 05:39.202
There's been a couple now,
haven't there?

05:39.237 --> 05:41.520
Yeah. Wasn't there a lass,
from Rochdale?

05:41.555 --> 05:43.768
There was one not long
ago, in Castleford.

05:43.803 --> 05:47.084
Yeah, Jeanette Garland.
Never found her, neither.

05:47.119 --> 05:48.489
Didn't they?

05:48.524 --> 05:50.649
Hear them wheels...

05:50.684 --> 05:52.444
They never caught no-one.

05:52.479 --> 05:54.205
Never do, though, do they?

06:21.769 --> 06:23.730
Eh up, Jock, how are you?
You all right?

06:23.765 --> 06:24.775
You all right?

06:24.810 --> 06:26.450
Good to see you. Yeah, I'm good.

06:26.485 --> 06:28.130
The prodigal returns!

06:29.730 --> 06:31.211
Eddie!

06:33.691 --> 06:35.932
Here to shee the old man,
Mish Moneypenny.

06:35.967 --> 06:37.572
Didn't cut it down south, then?

06:37.607 --> 06:39.177
Funny

06:39.212 --> 06:41.257
So, sir, if I could
get your attention.

06:41.292 --> 06:45.853
We have three missing girls. They're
all aged between eight and ten.

06:45.888 --> 06:49.659
1969, 1972...
and then the day before yesterday

06:49.694 --> 06:53.534
and they all go missing
within miles of one another, sir.

06:53.569 --> 06:56.455
This could be the A34 Murders
all over again.

06:56.490 --> 06:58.215
Oh, do let's hope so,
eh, Mr Dunford?

06:58.250 --> 06:59.980
Fingers crossed, eh.

07:00.015 --> 07:01.776
I were being sarcastic, Edward.

07:03.056 --> 07:04.861
Sorry.

07:04.896 --> 07:07.377
Have you spoken to Jack Whitehead
about this?

07:07.412 --> 07:08.502
No.

07:08.537 --> 07:10.797
No, this is my story,

07:10.832 --> 07:13.058
isn't it, Mr Hadley?

07:13.093 --> 07:15.663
Spot The Ball.

07:15.698 --> 07:20.179
It's the reason 39% of
working-class males buy this paper.

07:20.214 --> 07:22.716
That's interesting...

07:22.751 --> 07:25.185
You honestly think so?

07:25.220 --> 07:27.020
What? About working class males?

07:28.660 --> 07:30.580
Do you think it
could be the same man?

07:30.615 --> 07:33.261
Yes, sir. Yes, I do.

07:35.141 --> 07:38.902
Right. I'll fix you up with a one
to one first thing in the morning

07:38.937 --> 07:41.862
with DCS Molloy.
Bill Molloy suspects itinerants.

07:41.897 --> 07:43.628
Gypsies...

07:43.663 --> 07:46.383
Oh! Oh, well, of course he does.

07:46.418 --> 07:48.268
Now, don't push him, lad.

07:48.303 --> 07:50.869
This paper enjoys a good
relationship with our newly

07:50.904 --> 07:55.305
amalgamated Police Force and I for
one would like to keep it that way.

07:55.340 --> 07:56.945
Of course, sir, of course.

07:56.980 --> 07:57.990
Good.

07:58.025 --> 08:00.505
You really want to have
a go at these, Edward.

08:00.540 --> 08:02.146
They'd be right up your street.

08:02.181 --> 08:03.266
Thank you, sir, I will.

08:05.746 --> 08:06.506
Edward.

08:06.541 --> 08:07.266
Yep?

08:08.827 --> 08:10.427
Don't cock it up, eh?

08:25.389 --> 08:29.310
Unbelievable! They'd hacked
fucking swan's wings off.

08:29.345 --> 08:31.710
Clean off!
Left poor bastard lying there...

08:31.745 --> 08:32.275
You're joking!

08:32.311 --> 08:33.751
Still alive apparently.

08:36.671 --> 08:39.116
Eddie, how'd it go with Hadley?

08:39.152 --> 08:42.192
He's not convinced.
Usual bollocks. Don't cause a fuss.

08:42.227 --> 08:43.876
Right.

08:43.912 --> 08:46.953
One thing's for sure.
They're linked all right.

08:46.988 --> 08:48.918
I know it.

08:48.953 --> 08:50.519
Yeah, but linked how?

08:50.554 --> 08:52.314
Everything's linked, Eddie.

08:52.349 --> 08:54.074
Show me two things that aren't.

08:55.634 --> 08:57.955
Stoke City and the
fucking championship.

08:57.990 --> 08:59.435
Come here.

09:04.716 --> 09:07.121
Eddie, it's a conspiracy.

09:07.156 --> 09:09.442
We've got MI5 keeping
an eye on our Harold.

09:09.477 --> 09:11.837
Mountbatten waiting in the wings
with a military junta...

09:11.872 --> 09:12.922
Bollocks.

09:12.957 --> 09:15.478
There are Death Squads out there.
They give them a taste

09:15.513 --> 09:17.238
in Northern Ireland,
bring 'em back home hungry.

09:17.273 --> 09:18.723
Fuck off. Death Squads!

09:18.758 --> 09:20.859
Every city has its Death Squads.

09:20.894 --> 09:22.924
Sentence first, evidence after.

09:22.959 --> 09:26.039
I'll steer well clear of Wakey
County Council Death Squad then...

09:26.074 --> 09:27.125
You can laugh.

09:27.160 --> 09:30.360
I will! Why not work Watergate in
too, while you're about it?

09:30.395 --> 09:32.165
Death Squads, Barry?

09:32.200 --> 09:33.801
Come on, you're losing it, mate.

09:38.281 --> 09:38.881
Oh, shit...

09:38.916 --> 09:39.887
What?

09:39.922 --> 09:42.162
Oh, you're a lucky man, Dunford.

09:42.197 --> 09:44.967
Mr Gannon?

09:45.002 --> 09:47.088
BJ... In there.

09:47.123 --> 09:48.563
You all right, fella?

09:52.564 --> 09:53.684
Fuckin' hell!

09:53.719 --> 09:54.769
Business.

09:54.804 --> 09:57.244
Oh, I didn't think
it were pleasure, did I?

10:02.365 --> 10:03.931
Oi?

10:03.966 --> 10:07.486
Having a nice time back up north?

10:07.521 --> 10:10.784
You know, Barry. Gets a bit obtuse.

10:10.819 --> 10:14.047
Obtuse?
There's a big word for you.

10:15.647 --> 10:17.293
How about you?

10:17.328 --> 10:19.568
How about me, what?

10:21.568 --> 10:23.414
You having a good time?

10:23.449 --> 10:25.769
Oh, I love being on my own in bars.

10:25.804 --> 10:27.854
You weren't alone.

10:27.889 --> 10:29.970
You could have come over.

10:30.005 --> 10:32.287
I weren't invited.

10:32.322 --> 10:34.571
Oh, poor baby.

10:38.211 --> 10:40.131
Oh, I love you.

10:40.452 --> 10:43.052
I love you, Eddie.

11:02.975 --> 11:04.736
I've missed you, Eddie, love...

11:25.579 --> 11:27.359
Eddie...

11:27.394 --> 11:29.140
It's him.

11:37.381 --> 11:38.906
Yeah?

11:38.941 --> 11:46.022
'Dunford? Thought you were a fucking
journalist. Start asking questions. '

11:46.057 --> 11:47.548
Who's is this?

11:47.583 --> 11:49.308
'You don't need to know.

11:49.343 --> 11:51.143
'You interested in the Romany Way?

11:52.743 --> 11:54.744
'White vans and gypos. '

11:54.779 --> 11:56.469
Where?

11:56.504 --> 11:59.424
'Hunslet Beeston exit off the M1.'

11:59.459 --> 11:59.950
When?

11:59.985 --> 12:02.466
'Mischief Night came early.

12:02.501 --> 12:03.986
'And you're late. '

13:15.118 --> 13:17.638
Someone had torched
the whole fucking place.

13:17.673 --> 13:19.684
It was like Vietnam or summat.

13:19.719 --> 13:22.399
Bill Molloy's got it in
for gypsies, hasn't he?

13:22.434 --> 13:24.399
You reckon it was the police?

13:24.434 --> 13:25.600
Their style.

13:28.480 --> 13:30.580
That land's ear-marked -

13:30.615 --> 13:32.681
new John Dawson Development.

13:36.081 --> 13:38.247
Here, don't be late, mate.

13:38.282 --> 13:41.242
The Badger doesn't
like newspaper men.

13:41.277 --> 13:44.043
Into the lion's den you go.

13:46.643 --> 13:49.363
Come on then, son, surprise me.

13:49.398 --> 13:51.929
Well, Mr Molloy, sir.

13:51.964 --> 13:55.304
I was wondering if there was
any news on Clare Kemplay.

13:55.339 --> 13:58.645
Nothing. Sweet fuck all.
That poor lass is dead, son.

14:00.645 --> 14:02.646
And Jeanette Garland, Susan Ridyard?

14:04.286 --> 14:07.451
There are some
similarities there, eh?

14:07.486 --> 14:10.367
I was thinking about the
A34 Murders, Cannock Chase...

14:10.402 --> 14:12.732
What the fuck do you
know about Cannock Chase?

14:12.767 --> 14:16.333
Just that... it turned out it
was the work of one man, wasn't it?

14:16.368 --> 14:19.968
And Jeanette Garland, Susan Ridyard
and Clare Kemplay all go missing...

14:20.004 --> 14:22.846
You're not the first one
to put that together, son.

14:22.881 --> 14:25.689
You vain little twat.
My senile bloody aunty could.

14:25.724 --> 14:28.047
You haven't got a story, son.

14:28.082 --> 14:30.335
Best we find a body and quick.

14:30.370 --> 14:35.411
Check the bins, see who's got
themselves an early away-day.

14:35.446 --> 14:36.611
Right.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.092
Pull in the local gypos and Paddies.

14:42.932 --> 14:45.453
Have we met before, son?

14:45.488 --> 14:47.973
No. No, I don't think so.

14:48.008 --> 14:50.138
Good.

14:50.173 --> 14:53.254
You do your digging, and
I'll do mine. Now fuck off.

14:55.334 --> 14:56.775
Hello, sir.

15:20.098 --> 15:21.739
Reporter, are you?

15:23.259 --> 15:24.464
That obvious, is it?

15:24.499 --> 15:28.500
Seen a few around here.
Ridyards' aren't in, love.

15:28.535 --> 15:30.940
Oh, right.
Do you know when they'll be back?

15:30.975 --> 15:32.825
Gone away for a few days.

15:32.860 --> 15:35.186
Can't blame them.
Brings it all back.

15:35.221 --> 15:38.501
What with them finding that
new one over in Fitzwilliam.

15:38.536 --> 15:39.747
Sorry, what?

15:39.782 --> 15:42.862
Clare Kemplay.
They found her. Just on news.

15:42.897 --> 15:44.582
Dumped on a building site.

15:50.183 --> 15:51.268
Eddie...

15:51.303 --> 15:53.144
Thanks for letting me know, love.

15:53.179 --> 15:55.149
Fuck you, Eddie.

15:55.184 --> 15:58.865
Jack Whitehead! Crime Reporter
of the Year. Fancy you being here.

15:58.900 --> 16:00.882
Glad you could join us, Scoop.

16:00.917 --> 16:02.865
Boss wants to see you ASAP.

16:05.026 --> 16:06.511
Early bird and all that?!

16:06.546 --> 16:08.746
Is it true you like it
up trap two from Jack?

16:08.781 --> 16:10.272
You're the one who's fucked, Scoop.

16:10.307 --> 16:12.547
You couldn't be reached,
so I sent for Jack.

16:12.582 --> 16:13.712
So I'm off the story?

16:13.747 --> 16:16.828
Not at all, not at all.
Just sit down a minute, Edward.

16:17.948 --> 16:20.673
Edward, park your arse,
I want a word. Look, I have

16:20.708 --> 16:22.989
a couple of other things I want
you to follow up for me. A favour.

16:23.024 --> 16:24.874
What? What favour?

16:24.909 --> 16:26.269
I want you to go to Shangri-La.

16:26.304 --> 16:27.394
What?

16:27.429 --> 16:28.955
Shangri-La.

16:28.990 --> 16:32.310
It was a silver wedding present
apparently - her favourite film.

16:34.310 --> 16:35.551
What you on about?

16:35.586 --> 16:36.791
The Dawson place.

16:36.826 --> 16:39.076
John Dawson?

16:39.111 --> 16:39.751
The construction magnate?

16:39.786 --> 16:40.797
Right.

16:40.832 --> 16:42.797
Barry's got a theory...

16:42.832 --> 16:46.037
Local corruption. Barry reckons
that Marjorie Dawson

16:46.072 --> 16:49.233
will corroborate all the stuff
he's dug up on her husband.

16:49.268 --> 16:52.050
Look, Marjorie Dawson
is not a well woman.

16:52.085 --> 16:54.799
It is ethically dubious
to bother her.

16:54.834 --> 16:59.275
I want you to go with Barry and make
sure he doesn't go off the deep end.

16:59.310 --> 17:01.000
And what about Clare Kemplay?

17:01.035 --> 17:03.475
Let Jack handle it
for the most part, eh?

17:03.510 --> 17:04.996
You can do the background.

17:05.031 --> 17:06.036
Who found her?

17:08.356 --> 17:09.840
A builder's mate.

17:09.876 --> 17:12.362
A lad from Fitzwilliam.

17:12.396 --> 17:14.877
Edward, I'm asking you to drop it.

17:16.477 --> 17:18.278
All right.

17:18.313 --> 17:19.483
Good.

17:19.518 --> 17:21.838
So, you'll stay away
from Fitzwilliam, then?

17:54.484 --> 17:56.084
Hi, Mrs Cole?

17:57.764 --> 18:00.205
Edward Dunford.
I'm from the Yorkshire Post.

18:00.240 --> 18:02.262
To see our Leonard, isn't it?

18:02.297 --> 18:04.250
That's right. Just a quick chat.

18:04.285 --> 18:07.486
He's had enough with the police. He
doesn't need to keep going over it.

18:07.521 --> 18:08.686
Mary, Mary. It's OK.

18:08.721 --> 18:10.851
It's all right.

18:10.886 --> 18:12.387
Hi, Sorry, I'm Martin Laws.

18:12.422 --> 18:13.852
A pleasure. Edward Dunford.

18:13.887 --> 18:16.527
Sorry about my hands.
I've been working the allotments.

18:16.562 --> 18:19.045
Not a problem. I'm just here
for a quick chat with

18:19.080 --> 18:21.528
Leonard if that's all right?
Don't want to bother you.

18:24.969 --> 18:26.769
Put the comic away, Leonard.

18:26.804 --> 18:28.734
All right, Leonard?

18:28.769 --> 18:32.055
I'm Edward Dunford. I'm a
journalist with the Yorkshire Post.

18:32.090 --> 18:35.330
I just want to ask you a couple
of questions. Nowt to worry about!

18:35.365 --> 18:36.410
They thought he'd done it, you know.

18:36.445 --> 18:37.588
Shut up, mum!

18:37.623 --> 18:38.731
Hey, you.

18:40.771 --> 18:42.692
The police realised
it was a mistake.

18:45.932 --> 18:48.452
Why did they think
you'd done it, Leonard?

18:48.487 --> 18:49.653
Ask them.

18:50.773 --> 18:54.053
He's a good boy, Mr Dunford.
He didn't do nothing.

18:54.088 --> 18:56.579
No, I know, I can see that.

18:56.614 --> 18:59.254
You might as well get some
brass out of it, Leonard,

18:59.289 --> 19:00.459
tell us what happened.

19:00.494 --> 19:02.495
It's not about the money,
Mr Dunford.

19:02.530 --> 19:04.015
It's the truth that matters.

19:07.776 --> 19:09.576
Leonard will show you the place.

19:09.611 --> 19:11.376
She were a lovely little thing.

19:33.660 --> 19:37.340
We were waiting for
Gaffer, but he never come,

19:37.375 --> 19:40.026
and it were raining so...

19:40.061 --> 19:42.741
we were just arsing about,
you know.

19:42.776 --> 19:44.942
I went over to have a waz, like.

19:48.542 --> 19:50.463
And that's when I saw her.

19:51.703 --> 19:53.508
Down there.

19:53.543 --> 19:55.023
She were lying there.

19:57.984 --> 19:58.984
She had um...

20:00.024 --> 20:01.985
She had... wings.

20:02.020 --> 20:03.162
What?

20:03.197 --> 20:04.305
Oh, fuck!

20:08.706 --> 20:10.386
I couldn't believe it were her.

20:23.508 --> 20:26.949
On the day she went missing,
Clare was wearing a red kagoule

20:26.984 --> 20:28.354
and red Wellington boots.

20:28.389 --> 20:31.189
When Clare left Morley Grange
Junior and Infants School

20:31.224 --> 20:32.630
she was seen by witnesses...

20:49.672 --> 20:52.033
You hard at it, Jackie?

20:52.068 --> 20:54.758
Hello, Scoop.

20:54.793 --> 20:57.314
Just had a chat with Leonard Cole.

20:57.349 --> 20:59.679
You naughty boy.

20:59.714 --> 21:02.714
Didn't Aunty Hadley say you had
to go home for an early bath?

21:04.875 --> 21:08.035
Heard you were over at
Clare Kemplay's post-mortem.

21:08.070 --> 21:11.556
The police are withholding
exact details.

21:13.196 --> 21:15.357
Haven't you got
a family to go home to?

21:20.437 --> 21:23.398
You keep following me like this
and your friend Barry's

21:23.433 --> 21:24.638
gonna get very jealous.

21:26.878 --> 21:28.404
Did you get a look at it?

21:28.439 --> 21:30.959
Your friend or the post-mortem?

21:33.279 --> 21:34.600
Yeah, I saw it...

21:34.635 --> 21:35.597
And?

21:35.632 --> 21:36.525
And?

21:36.560 --> 21:38.885
And, a little girl

21:38.920 --> 21:42.641
was tortured, raped and strangled.

21:42.676 --> 21:44.081
In that order.

21:46.162 --> 21:47.962
Right. I want to know the details.

21:47.997 --> 21:48.882
No you don't, Scoop.

21:48.917 --> 21:50.087
Jack.

21:50.122 --> 21:52.008
Jack, don't fuck around.

21:52.043 --> 21:55.723
Whatever happened to all those
novels you wanted to write

21:55.758 --> 21:58.004
but you were too scared
shitless to even try?

21:58.039 --> 22:01.444
All right, mate, all right.

22:01.479 --> 22:02.809
You fucking tell me!

22:02.844 --> 22:09.045
Eddie, I am pissing on my
trouser leg and yours too.

22:09.080 --> 22:10.526
You're fucking pathetic.

22:12.126 --> 22:13.566
Just a hack!

22:17.247 --> 22:19.607
Such insight.

22:32.609 --> 22:34.614
A man left this for you, love.

22:34.650 --> 22:37.730
Nice man.
Said he was a friend of yours.

22:37.765 --> 22:39.450
Jack somebody or other.

22:43.171 --> 22:44.571
Mum, I'm working.

23:41.540 --> 23:43.981
'A swan's wing was
stitched into her back. '

23:56.943 --> 23:59.903
'4 Luv. '

24:00.984 --> 24:02.744
'Carved into her skin... '

24:04.184 --> 24:06.465
'Carved into her skin. '

24:21.281 --> 24:23.961
Here we are, Shangri-La.

24:29.722 --> 24:31.803
All great buildings resemble
crimes, they say.

24:31.838 --> 24:32.763
Oh?

24:38.684 --> 24:40.329
Right.

24:40.364 --> 24:43.985
Oh, fuck Hadley, I'm gonna go and
talk to Jeanette Garland's family.

24:44.020 --> 24:47.605
You still think there's a connection
to Clare Kemplay and t'other girls?

24:47.640 --> 24:49.326
Absolutely, yeah.

24:49.361 --> 24:50.691
Good lad.

24:50.726 --> 24:52.886
And, er, don't go off
the deep end, Barry.

24:52.921 --> 24:54.886
Ha-ha

24:59.687 --> 25:01.868
'.. Labour government is being seen

25:01.903 --> 25:04.013
'as a resounding victory for miners.

25:04.048 --> 25:09.969
'Around 260,000 miners are expecting
weekly pay rises ranging from... '

25:38.294 --> 25:40.059
Hey.

25:40.094 --> 25:41.894
Are you Mrs Paula Garland?

25:41.929 --> 25:43.059
Yeah.

25:43.094 --> 25:47.855
Hi... I'm Edward Dunford,
I'm from the Yorkshire Post.

25:47.890 --> 25:50.656
I just wanted a quick chat
about Jeanette.

25:55.576 --> 25:57.297
Sure? Thank you.

26:00.537 --> 26:02.177
Mr Garland about, or...?

26:06.778 --> 26:10.264
What is it that you want,
Mr... Mr Dunford?

26:10.299 --> 26:15.580
Erm... Well, I'm doing this article
and it's about the...

26:17.060 --> 26:19.620
About parents of children
who have gone missing.

26:21.261 --> 26:26.621
It's about how people like yourself,
like your husband, have coped

26:26.656 --> 26:30.262
after all the fuss has died down.

26:31.382 --> 26:34.903
It must be a very difficult time
for you, bringing it all back.

26:34.938 --> 26:37.343
I understand that.
I know how you must've felt.

26:37.378 --> 26:39.384
No, you have no idea how I feel.

26:44.544 --> 26:47.865
One of the things, for example...

26:47.900 --> 26:51.070
Do you feel that the police

26:51.105 --> 26:53.026
could have done anything more
to have helped you?

26:53.061 --> 26:54.866
Yeah, there was one thing.

26:54.901 --> 26:56.351
Right, what was that?

26:56.386 --> 26:58.067
They could have found my daughter.

27:00.787 --> 27:01.912
Yeah.

27:01.947 --> 27:06.228
You come into my house like you're
discussing the weather, or some...

27:06.263 --> 27:10.509
war in another fucking country.
You know this thing happened to me.

27:13.469 --> 27:15.349
Get out, please.

27:15.384 --> 27:17.230
Just get out!

27:22.311 --> 27:24.431
He killed himself.

27:24.466 --> 27:26.916
What?

27:26.951 --> 27:28.392
Her husband's dead?

27:30.792 --> 27:34.313
Never got over Jeanette.
Sucked on a shotgun a year back.

27:34.348 --> 27:37.838
Oh... Shit.

27:37.873 --> 27:40.239
You're supposed to know
these things, Dunford.

27:40.274 --> 27:43.114
It didn't exactly make
the front page down south, did it?

27:43.149 --> 27:45.194
Well, it did here.
You should've fucking known!

27:45.229 --> 27:47.115
Do your job.

27:48.235 --> 27:49.635
Time, gentlemen, please!

27:51.755 --> 27:54.636
How about you, how was Shangri-La?

28:03.237 --> 28:05.198
Mrs Dawson told me
my life's in danger.

28:09.318 --> 28:10.759
Bollocks.

28:15.239 --> 28:18.240
Barry, if you believe it,
you've gotta tell someone.

28:18.275 --> 28:19.917
Who? The law? Fuck that.

28:19.952 --> 28:21.560
These people are the law.

28:23.761 --> 28:24.681
Eddie?

28:24.716 --> 28:25.566
Yeah?

28:25.601 --> 28:27.001
That Gypsy camp at Hunslet Carr.

28:27.036 --> 28:28.046
Yeah?

28:28.081 --> 28:29.207
Take a closer look.

28:29.242 --> 28:32.522
Dawson set up a Â£100 million
property trust.

28:32.557 --> 28:35.008
One hundred million.

28:35.043 --> 28:37.523
Be interesting to know
who else is on that board...

28:38.803 --> 28:41.284
There are death squads
out there, right?

28:41.319 --> 28:42.689
You're ignorant, Dunford.

28:42.724 --> 28:45.644
Try carrying a history book
along with that notepad of yours.

28:47.485 --> 28:49.305
Want a lift, or what?

28:49.340 --> 28:51.125
Going t'other way.

28:52.925 --> 28:56.851
Hey! Pisshead!

28:56.886 --> 28:59.487
You never had the urge to
deliver us from evil, then?

29:01.407 --> 29:03.412
No, never!

29:03.447 --> 29:06.408
The devil triumphs
when good men do nowt.

29:43.294 --> 29:44.299
What you doin' here, lad?

29:44.334 --> 29:46.294
Just been for a pint, what about you?

29:46.329 --> 29:49.380
Fuck off!

29:49.415 --> 29:51.455
It's all right,
I'm over 18, Dad. Honest.

29:51.490 --> 29:52.815
Shut up, you little poof!

29:52.850 --> 29:53.735
Oh!

29:58.376 --> 30:00.942
I didn't do owt! What do you want?

30:00.977 --> 30:04.457
I'll tell you what we don't want.
We don't want tits like you

30:04.492 --> 30:07.755
bothering people
we don't want bothering.

30:07.790 --> 30:11.018
Yeah. It's not very nice, is it?
Is it?! Eh?!

31:08.108 --> 31:09.548
All right, Mrs Garland?

31:13.869 --> 31:15.389
Seems like a nice local...

31:15.424 --> 31:16.909
Yeah, yeah, it used to be.

31:20.070 --> 31:21.830
Mind if I have a sit for a sec?

31:23.470 --> 31:24.950
One of them for me?

31:40.073 --> 31:41.873
Come here often?

31:42.993 --> 31:45.594
Sounds like you're trying
to pick me up, Mr Dunford.

31:49.394 --> 31:52.275
Hope your friends in the force
don't see us here together...

31:52.310 --> 31:53.435
What?

31:55.115 --> 31:56.796
I dunno what you're talking about.

31:58.036 --> 32:00.236
It's all right. I got the message.

32:02.356 --> 32:05.557
You didn't have to do that.
You didn't need to go to the police.

32:05.592 --> 32:07.517
I never said anything to the police.

32:07.552 --> 32:08.354
No?

32:08.389 --> 32:09.123
No.

32:09.158 --> 32:09.758
Who'd you tell then?

32:09.793 --> 32:10.803
No-one.

32:10.838 --> 32:13.238
Look, Mrs Garland...

32:13.273 --> 32:15.604
Paula, it's Paula.

32:15.639 --> 32:17.719
Paula, I'm very, very sorry...

32:18.839 --> 32:21.000
.. about earlier.

32:23.400 --> 32:25.320
S'all right.
You were doing your job.

32:27.881 --> 32:30.041
It might help find my little girl.

32:32.961 --> 32:34.322
Even so, I was right out of order.

32:34.357 --> 32:35.119
Yeah.

32:35.154 --> 32:35.882
Yeah.

32:39.042 --> 32:41.843
I didn't know about your husband.

32:41.878 --> 32:43.043
Right.

32:45.283 --> 32:49.564
The ring always felt
a bit loose, to be honest.

32:51.725 --> 32:54.005
There, that was
a stupid thing to say.

33:00.926 --> 33:02.606
Want another drink?

33:11.448 --> 33:13.208
Just another drink, that's all...

33:13.243 --> 33:15.208
It's a bad idea.

35:22.029 --> 35:23.434
Eddie?

35:23.469 --> 35:25.150
It's for you.

35:25.185 --> 35:26.830
About Barry.

35:54.942 --> 35:57.302
His brakes went.
Straight into the back of the van.

35:58.822 --> 36:02.063
Pane of glass scalped him. Took the
top of his fucking head clean off.

36:03.903 --> 36:06.063
They're sure it's him?

36:06.098 --> 36:07.741
Barry's dead, mate.

36:07.776 --> 36:09.600
In fucking Morley too.

36:09.635 --> 36:11.424
Dead drunk's what I heard.

36:14.945 --> 36:16.425
You'd know, Jack!

36:18.025 --> 36:20.271
Mea culpa...

36:20.306 --> 36:23.346
but it wasn't me getting the dear
departed pissed up, was it?

36:26.187 --> 36:28.267
Come on, lads! Press conference.

36:40.669 --> 36:42.389
Sure you've got the stomach for it?

36:44.430 --> 36:45.910
Like you, Jack?

36:48.630 --> 36:50.111
Oh, no. You're the man.

36:51.831 --> 36:54.311
Jack Whitehead's away
from his desk just now.

37:20.876 --> 37:23.161
Sergeant Bob Fraser.

37:23.196 --> 37:25.316
Thanks for coming, Mr Dunford.

37:25.351 --> 37:27.317
I know you were friends.

37:27.352 --> 37:28.757
Yeah.

37:32.317 --> 37:33.918
So the van was
carrying plates of glass?

37:33.953 --> 37:34.323
Yes.

37:34.358 --> 37:35.918
And one went through his windscreen?

37:35.953 --> 37:37.438
Yes.

37:40.416 --> 37:42.416
So, you reckon it
were instantaneous?

37:42.451 --> 37:43.496
I'd say so, sir, yes.

37:47.177 --> 37:48.617
Fuck.

37:51.578 --> 37:56.578
I understand you last saw Mr Gannon
in the Shakespeare Public House.

37:56.613 --> 37:58.819
Would you say he
was drinking heavily?

37:58.854 --> 38:01.544
No, no.

38:01.579 --> 38:03.780
And you've no idea
where he went from there?

38:03.815 --> 38:05.985
No.

38:06.020 --> 38:08.340
No idea why he might have
come to Morley.

38:08.375 --> 38:10.958
No, none.

38:10.993 --> 38:13.506
I see.

38:13.541 --> 38:15.942
We almost have all the details, sir.

38:15.977 --> 38:18.342
There'll be an inquest tomorrow.

38:20.702 --> 38:21.788
Bit quick, isn't it?

38:21.823 --> 38:25.003
I think the family are keen to,

38:25.038 --> 38:28.184
you know, get it all sorted.

38:33.224 --> 38:36.305
If anything occurs to you,
I can be reached through

38:36.340 --> 38:37.825
the Morley police station.

38:39.986 --> 38:43.186
You're one of the good
ones, aren't you, sergeant?

38:43.221 --> 38:45.523
I do my best, sir.

38:45.558 --> 38:47.827
Not good copy, is it?

38:47.862 --> 38:48.787
No.

39:27.833 --> 39:31.054
"We live in an age of great
investigative journalism.

39:31.089 --> 39:34.274
"Barry Gannon was one of the
men who gave us that age.

39:34.309 --> 39:37.972
"Where he saw injustice,
he asked for justice.

39:38.007 --> 39:41.601
"Where he saw lies,
he asked for the truth.

39:41.636 --> 39:44.636
"Barry Gannon once said that the
truth can only make us richer.

39:44.671 --> 39:46.401
"For those of us who seek the truth,

39:46.436 --> 39:50.317
"Barry Gannon's passing
can only make us poorer. "

39:51.917 --> 39:53.318
Not overly panegyric, is it?

39:56.118 --> 39:59.319
Panegyric? No, I don't think so.

40:06.320 --> 40:08.045
Do we really need this?

40:08.080 --> 40:10.880
There's been a spate of animal
mutilations.

40:10.915 --> 40:13.681
Hacked swans found
over on Breton Park.

40:16.241 --> 40:17.807
I'm not stupid.

40:17.842 --> 40:20.322
Jack showed me the post mortem.

40:20.357 --> 40:22.362
It's background, in't it?

40:24.563 --> 40:26.368
Get some police quotes.

40:26.403 --> 40:28.203
Maybe we'll run it on Thursday.

40:28.238 --> 40:29.328
Thank you, sir.

40:29.363 --> 40:32.164
No mention of Clare Kemplay, mind.

40:32.199 --> 40:34.244
Straightforward animal abuse.

40:34.279 --> 40:36.045
Like those pit ponies.

40:36.080 --> 40:37.290
Yeah, no problem.

40:37.325 --> 40:39.485
And pull back on some of
the more visceral details.

40:39.520 --> 40:41.766
Don't want that with
your cornflakes, do you?

40:43.046 --> 40:45.131
Absolutely, Mr Hadley.

40:45.166 --> 40:46.846
Edward, you're trying too hard.

40:46.881 --> 40:49.012
You're like Barry.

40:49.047 --> 40:52.132
We could be sued because of Barry.

40:52.167 --> 40:55.648
Mrs Dawson's been recovering in
Hartley's after his visit.

40:55.683 --> 40:57.448
Hartley's loony bin?

40:57.483 --> 40:58.973
Nursing home.

40:59.008 --> 41:01.629
I'm sorry to hear that, sir.

41:01.664 --> 41:04.249
Take care, won't you, lad?

41:04.284 --> 41:05.689
Yeah.

41:16.011 --> 41:18.732
I'm here to see Aunty Marjorie.

41:18.767 --> 41:20.817
Marjorie Dawson, sorry.

41:20.852 --> 41:23.297
We've had to give her
something for her nerves.

41:23.332 --> 41:25.813
She was in a right state
when they brought her back.

41:32.454 --> 41:34.019
Mrs Dawson?

41:34.054 --> 41:36.419
You have a visitor.

41:36.454 --> 41:39.015
It's Eric, Mrs Dawson. Your nephew.

41:40.655 --> 41:43.056
It sometimes takes her
a while to come round.

41:43.091 --> 41:45.336
I understand. Thank you.

42:05.579 --> 42:07.019
It's locked.

42:10.460 --> 42:12.985
Who are you?

42:13.020 --> 42:15.861
Edward Dunford. I'm a journalist.

42:15.896 --> 42:18.701
So, you've been telling lies.

42:20.302 --> 42:21.822
Privilege of the profession.

42:40.985 --> 42:44.466
I just want to ask you a
couple of questions, Mrs Dawson.

42:44.501 --> 42:46.426
I can't help you, Mr Dunford.

42:49.386 --> 42:52.467
I think maybe you can.

42:52.502 --> 42:54.472
You see...

42:54.507 --> 42:59.788
you told my friend Barry Gannon
that his life was in danger.

42:59.823 --> 43:01.748
He was killed last night.

43:03.349 --> 43:07.114
How terrible.

43:07.149 --> 43:08.830
You didn't know that, did you?

43:10.470 --> 43:13.190
Who knows what I'm
supposed to know these days.

43:16.751 --> 43:22.352
I can't figure out why you would
tell my friend he was in danger?

43:24.992 --> 43:27.753
He always used to be so careful.

43:27.788 --> 43:30.513
Who? Your husband?

43:32.754 --> 43:36.794
You smell so strongly.

43:38.795 --> 43:39.875
Sorry.

43:41.355 --> 43:43.635
You smell of death.

43:52.077 --> 43:53.217
Mrs Dawson...

43:53.252 --> 43:54.357
Don't touch me!

43:58.238 --> 44:00.118
Look... look! Shh.

44:00.153 --> 44:01.635
It's all right.

44:01.670 --> 44:03.118
It's all right!

44:05.239 --> 44:07.639
Tell them about the others.

44:09.079 --> 44:10.720
The others.

44:12.480 --> 44:14.400
Please tell them where they are.

44:14.435 --> 44:16.321
Tell me what you're talking about!

44:16.356 --> 44:17.641
You must be going...

44:17.676 --> 44:18.686
Ah!

44:18.721 --> 44:20.401
Lying bastard!

44:20.436 --> 44:21.361
Get up!

44:23.842 --> 44:25.127
Oh! Ow!

44:25.162 --> 44:29.683
# A certain smile...

44:32.923 --> 44:35.404
# A certain face...

44:37.124 --> 44:41.205
# Can lead an unsuspecting heart

44:43.445 --> 44:46.206
# On a merry chase... #

44:57.127 --> 44:58.528
Ahh!

46:37.584 --> 46:39.404
They found you by the car.

46:39.439 --> 46:41.224
You were covered in blood.

46:41.259 --> 46:43.425
Mmm.

46:47.905 --> 46:49.866
What time is it?

46:49.901 --> 46:51.826
Just gone six, love.

47:10.189 --> 47:11.549
What are you doing?

47:11.584 --> 47:12.675
Mum...

47:12.710 --> 47:14.350
Don't be daft. You're not fit!

47:14.385 --> 47:16.030
This is my work, right?

47:17.510 --> 47:19.031
Don't do this to him.

47:21.831 --> 47:23.276
No, no, no, no...

47:23.311 --> 47:25.992
He really loved you, your dad.

47:29.472 --> 47:31.233
He had a funny way of showing it.

47:36.153 --> 47:38.354
'You never did one good thing, you. '

47:48.235 --> 47:50.001
Mum... Mum...

47:50.036 --> 47:51.756
I've gotta go, Mum.

47:51.791 --> 47:52.673
OK?

47:52.708 --> 47:53.556
Yeah...

47:57.397 --> 47:58.757
It's not safe.

48:43.124 --> 48:45.085
In there.

48:51.726 --> 48:52.846
Dad?

49:22.491 --> 49:24.571
Sit down, then.

49:27.972 --> 49:29.492
Here, look.

49:29.527 --> 49:30.977
Thank you.

49:31.012 --> 49:33.133
So what happened to your hand?

49:35.853 --> 49:38.453
It was the same two coppers that
warned me off last time I was here.

49:38.488 --> 49:42.214
Look, I told you before - I never
said anything to the police.

49:42.249 --> 49:44.174
Paula, please.

49:45.575 --> 49:47.815
Come on, I need to know.

49:51.696 --> 49:53.256
Paula, please tell me.

49:57.096 --> 49:58.582
All right.

49:58.617 --> 50:01.017
I was upset after you went.

50:01.052 --> 50:03.417
So, er... So John came over.

50:06.058 --> 50:07.638
Who's John?

50:07.673 --> 50:09.218
John Dawson.

50:19.460 --> 50:20.905
So what'd you tell him?

50:20.940 --> 50:23.981
Some fucking journalist
had been round asking questions.

50:24.016 --> 50:25.341
You pissed me off.

50:26.461 --> 50:28.022
There you go, then.

50:32.742 --> 50:34.823
Why don't you tell me about Dawson?

50:36.943 --> 50:39.423
He was very kind to us
when Jeanette went missing.

50:41.144 --> 50:44.264
Substandard housing,
dodgy property trusts,

50:44.299 --> 50:44.824
backhanders
to the local council...

50:44.859 --> 50:46.402
He's been very good to me.

50:46.437 --> 50:47.910
Oh, yeah? I bet he has.

50:47.945 --> 50:49.550
What is that supposed to mean?

50:49.585 --> 50:50.745
D'you think he'd do
something like this?

50:50.780 --> 50:51.482
No.

50:51.517 --> 50:52.150
No?

50:52.185 --> 50:52.871
No. Why would he?

50:52.906 --> 50:54.546
Maybe because of what I know.

50:54.581 --> 50:56.186
And what do you know, Eddie?

50:57.666 --> 51:01.307
I know that Clare Kemplay was found
on a Dawson construction site.

51:03.747 --> 51:05.593
You're talking nonsense.

51:05.628 --> 51:08.188
I know all the Dawsons
in this world care about

51:08.223 --> 51:09.605
are their lies and their money.

51:09.640 --> 51:10.989
Look, you don't know anything!

51:11.024 --> 51:13.509
You're just a... a boy.

51:15.989 --> 51:21.750
And I know there's some bastard
out there who's taking, raping,

51:21.785 --> 51:23.316
murdering little girls,

51:23.351 --> 51:27.151
and nobody is gonna stop him
because nobody really fucking cares!

51:27.186 --> 51:28.076
And you do?

51:28.111 --> 51:29.472
Yeah, maybe I do.

51:43.474 --> 51:44.834
Thank you.

53:48.454 --> 53:53.455
Fly away, Peter, fly away, Paul!

53:56.216 --> 53:57.816
Hmm...

54:02.857 --> 54:04.497
You know when she was just a baby?

54:04.532 --> 54:05.777
I...

54:09.058 --> 54:11.743
I used to lie awake at night

54:11.778 --> 54:16.019
and wonder what I'd do
if anything...

54:16.054 --> 54:19.104
happened to her.

54:19.139 --> 54:23.460
I'd run to her room
and I'd wake her up...

54:25.620 --> 54:28.661
.. and I'd hug her
and hug her and hug her.

54:29.701 --> 54:30.901
And...

54:33.182 --> 54:35.502
.. and when she never came home...

54:38.022 --> 54:41.183
.. those terrible things
had come true.

55:23.030 --> 55:25.195
Good piece by Hadley, wasn't it?

55:25.230 --> 55:27.151
Bit on the panegyric side, I thought.

55:27.186 --> 55:28.636
Oh, aye, I suppose.

55:28.671 --> 55:31.751
Barry would have appreciated it.

55:32.591 --> 55:34.192
Doubt it.

55:39.032 --> 55:42.313
Going for a spin, Mr Dumford?

55:46.074 --> 55:47.594
Why would I want to do that?

55:50.154 --> 55:52.515
I was a great admirer
of your late colleague.

55:52.550 --> 55:55.595
Such a waste.

55:59.196 --> 56:01.401
John Dawson,

56:01.436 --> 56:04.437
Fuck the press-code, boy, eh?

56:07.957 --> 56:11.358
Champion, jump in.

56:21.959 --> 56:25.440
This nation's in fucking chaos
with its hung parliaments.

56:25.475 --> 56:28.641
A year ago, they were
to bring back rationing.

56:28.676 --> 56:32.161
Now we've got inflation
at fucking 25%.

56:33.321 --> 56:37.042
The country's at war, Mr Dunford.
The government and the unions,

56:37.077 --> 56:40.162
the left and the right,
the rich and the poor.

56:40.197 --> 56:42.368
Then you've got your enemies within.

56:42.403 --> 56:47.164
Your Paddies, your wogs, your
niggers, your fucking gypos,

56:47.199 --> 56:50.044
the poofs, the perverts,
even the bloody women.

56:50.079 --> 56:52.129
They're all out for
what they can get.

56:52.164 --> 56:55.525
I tell you, soon there'll be
nowt left for us lot.

56:55.560 --> 56:57.690
Time to turn the tide.

56:57.725 --> 56:59.526
So you're not a Labour man then?

56:59.561 --> 57:00.651
Course I bloody am!

57:00.686 --> 57:02.826
Tory cunts have
outpriced theirselves.

57:02.861 --> 57:04.967
A Labour men will always do a deal.

57:08.047 --> 57:11.608
Trouble with your generation
is you know nowt.

57:11.643 --> 57:13.888
Your lot never fought a bloody war.

57:15.288 --> 57:20.209
Fucking cowboys and Indians
then, son - like now.

57:25.810 --> 57:30.931
You going to continue our late friend's
crusade against local corruption, Mr Dunford?

57:32.411 --> 57:34.451
Why do you ask me that?

57:35.852 --> 57:38.852
Me and Barry had a very
special relationship.

57:40.652 --> 57:42.813
Most of the time.

57:44.813 --> 57:47.614
Mutually beneficial, it was.

57:49.414 --> 57:51.174
In what way?

57:53.294 --> 57:56.500
I'm in a fortunate position
to be able to...

57:56.535 --> 57:59.981
occasionally pass on
information that comes my way.

58:00.016 --> 58:03.536
Certain officials sticking their
fingers where they shouldn't,

58:03.571 --> 58:04.496
that kind of thing.

58:09.737 --> 58:10.817
Like the cut?

58:13.618 --> 58:14.738
Top man, your dad.

58:16.898 --> 58:20.059
Knew how to cut his cloth.

58:20.094 --> 58:21.704
Solid.

58:21.739 --> 58:22.739
Dependable.

58:24.740 --> 58:26.740
That's not you, is it, Mr Dunford?

58:28.380 --> 58:29.545
You're more like me.

58:29.580 --> 58:32.821
We like to fuck and make a buck and
we're not right choosy, are we?

58:32.856 --> 58:33.781
Ain't that right?

58:36.341 --> 58:38.742
Eh?

58:41.382 --> 58:43.583
Drop by Saturday lunchtime.

58:44.823 --> 58:46.783
Something might interest you.

58:55.105 --> 58:57.185
And, Mr Dunford... Aye?

58:58.385 --> 59:00.345
My wife is a very unwell woman.

59:01.546 --> 59:03.111
Speak to her again...

59:03.146 --> 59:05.826
it won't be your hand
that gets smashed.

59:07.547 --> 59:08.747
Come on.

59:19.761 --> 59:23.481
Ziggy was in, love, looking for you.

59:23.516 --> 59:25.367
You what?

59:25.402 --> 59:27.402
Poof with the orange hair.

59:27.437 --> 59:28.842
He's outside.

59:56.047 --> 59:58.047
Saw you at Barry's funeral, didn't I?

59:59.767 --> 01:00:01.928
We've seen things, you know.

01:00:01.963 --> 01:00:03.765
I'll bet you have.

01:00:03.800 --> 01:00:05.544
Listen, I know people.

01:00:05.579 --> 01:00:07.253
Powerful... people.

01:00:07.288 --> 01:00:09.294
Because I have sucked the cocks

01:00:09.329 --> 01:00:11.329
of some of the greatest
men this country has.

01:00:11.364 --> 01:00:13.246
A boy should have a hobby.

01:00:13.281 --> 01:00:15.206
Listen, don't let me keep you.

01:00:15.241 --> 01:00:17.130
Hey, relax, just relax. I'm sorry.

01:00:23.011 --> 01:00:26.011
It's all right.

01:00:26.046 --> 01:00:26.972
OK.

01:00:32.853 --> 01:00:34.733
I'm not going to bite you.

01:00:34.768 --> 01:00:36.613
You liked Barry, didn't you?

01:00:39.454 --> 01:00:41.514
Yeah, I did.

01:00:41.549 --> 01:00:43.261
Cos he was kind.

01:00:43.296 --> 01:00:44.975
Yeah, he was.

01:00:46.175 --> 01:00:47.615
And he liked you.

01:00:50.055 --> 01:00:52.176
He said he wanted to help you.

01:00:57.657 --> 01:00:59.837
This is his life's work.

01:00:59.872 --> 01:01:01.982
He said to give it to you

01:01:02.017 --> 01:01:03.818
in case anything happened to him.

01:01:06.938 --> 01:01:09.099
Do you think Barry was murdered?

01:01:11.379 --> 01:01:12.819
Listen to me.

01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:17.340
BJ loved Barry.

01:01:18.940 --> 01:01:20.380
Really loved him.

01:01:22.541 --> 01:01:25.621
But he was too fucking
scared to go to his funeral.

01:01:39.343 --> 01:01:41.424
I don't know who did Barry.

01:01:43.224 --> 01:01:44.784
I don't want to know.

01:02:16.990 --> 01:02:20.275
"Michael John Myshkin,
of 69 Newstead View, Fitzwilliam,

01:02:20.310 --> 01:02:24.871
"was today taken into police custody
for the murder of Clare Kemplay... "

01:02:25.911 --> 01:02:27.631
It's fucking mental out there.

01:02:27.666 --> 01:02:28.276
Where is he?

01:02:28.311 --> 01:02:30.232
Works for a photo lab,
dad's a Polack,

01:02:30.267 --> 01:02:31.992
hardly speaks a word of English.

01:02:32.027 --> 01:02:33.432
That's lucky.

01:02:36.033 --> 01:02:40.153
Are you Michael John Myshkin of
69 Newstead View, Fitzwilliam?

01:02:42.394 --> 01:02:43.479
Yes.

01:02:43.514 --> 01:02:48.595
You are accused that on or between
August 31 and 1 September

01:02:48.630 --> 01:02:50.795
you did murder Clare
Kemplay against the peace

01:02:50.830 --> 01:02:53.561
of our Sovereign Lady, the Queen.

01:02:53.596 --> 01:02:56.996
Mr Myshkin, the West Yorkshire
Metropolitan Police have requested

01:02:57.031 --> 01:02:59.334
that you be held in custody
for a further eight days.

01:02:59.369 --> 01:03:01.637
The court understands
that you have no objection.

01:03:04.837 --> 01:03:06.283
No.

01:03:06.318 --> 01:03:09.003
Michael John Myshkin,
due to the seriousness

01:03:09.038 --> 01:03:11.679
of the accusation, your case will
be referred to the Crown Court.

01:03:11.714 --> 01:03:15.159
In the interim you will
be remanded in custody.

01:03:17.119 --> 01:03:20.640
And that concludes the business
for today, your worships, thank you.

01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:26.561
Please, it wasn't me.
It were the wolf.

01:03:26.596 --> 01:03:28.966
Under the beautiful carpets.

01:03:29.001 --> 01:03:30.922
What was that, what did he just say?
The wolf, what was that?

01:03:30.957 --> 01:03:33.442
Something about carpets. Bollocks.

01:03:41.243 --> 01:03:42.724
We got the bastard then, Stu.

01:03:45.324 --> 01:03:47.364
You can't go in there!

01:03:49.125 --> 01:03:50.925
Bloody farce, isn't it?
Myshkin didn't do it, did he?

01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.210
He's confessed.

01:03:52.245 --> 01:03:54.371
Yeah, but it's absolute bollocks.

01:03:54.406 --> 01:03:58.046
"Nefarious deed carried out in what
he called his underground kingdom. "

01:03:58.081 --> 01:03:59.703
Jack, did you see him? He's retarded.

01:03:59.738 --> 01:04:01.327
No, his dad's just
a Polack, that's all.

01:04:01.362 --> 01:04:02.884
What's happened to your hand?

01:04:02.919 --> 01:04:04.407
I hope we don't cramp your style.

01:04:04.442 --> 01:04:05.052
Fuck off.

01:04:05.087 --> 01:04:06.453
Now watch your language!

01:04:06.488 --> 01:04:08.808
They found all kinds of
things in Myshkin's room, Scoop.

01:04:08.843 --> 01:04:11.248
Photos of little girls,
boxes of them.

01:04:11.283 --> 01:04:13.134
Well, he does work in a photo lab.

01:04:13.169 --> 01:04:16.169
He's coughing for the lot.
Clare Kemplay, Jeanette Garland

01:04:16.204 --> 01:04:18.570
and the Ridyard girl,
right back to 1969.

01:04:18.605 --> 01:04:19.775
Right, so, he's 22. Right?

01:04:19.810 --> 01:04:22.610
So therefore he would have been 16
when Susan Ridyard went missing, right?

01:04:22.645 --> 01:04:23.695
So?

01:04:23.730 --> 01:04:24.936
So, fuck you, Jack!

01:04:24.971 --> 01:04:27.531
Hey, now watch your
language in my office!

01:04:27.566 --> 01:04:29.011
It feels wrong, doesn't it?

01:04:29.046 --> 01:04:31.109
Eh? All that slog...

01:04:31.144 --> 01:04:33.137
all those hunches.

01:04:33.172 --> 01:04:35.892
You just don't want
it to be him, Scoop.

01:04:35.927 --> 01:04:37.150
I was the same once.

01:04:37.185 --> 01:04:39.019
You're in their pockets.

01:04:39.054 --> 01:04:40.818
What are you talking about?

01:04:40.853 --> 01:04:44.374
The police going about their business,
supported by the good old Yorkshire Post.

01:04:45.494 --> 01:04:48.219
The truth is the truth, Scoop.

01:04:48.254 --> 01:04:51.335
And it's a bitter pill.
But you'll get used to it one day.

01:04:51.370 --> 01:04:53.015
I'll handle the press conference,
boss.

01:04:53.050 --> 01:04:55.181
Thanks, Jack.

01:04:55.216 --> 01:04:57.936
Edward? I won't have you
coming in here like this.

01:04:57.971 --> 01:04:58.101
Like what?

01:04:58.136 --> 01:05:00.176
Like this! Now take the rest
of the month off

01:05:00.211 --> 01:05:01.337
and get that hand sorted out.

01:05:02.617 --> 01:05:05.137
Are you listening to me, lad?

01:05:05.172 --> 01:05:06.577
Edward?

01:05:09.458 --> 01:05:11.098
How well do you know John Dawson?

01:05:11.133 --> 01:05:12.538
Do you mind?

01:05:13.619 --> 01:05:17.779
Edward, I haven't got time for your
adolescent conspiracy theories.

01:05:17.814 --> 01:05:19.660
Go on, get home and
get yourself sorted out.

01:05:50.865 --> 01:05:52.345
She's dead, isn't she?

01:08:08.287 --> 01:08:11.408
# Love a while

01:08:13.008 --> 01:08:17.974
# And when love calls

01:08:18.009 --> 01:08:22.970
# You try to hide
the tears inside... #

01:08:23.005 --> 01:08:24.050
Branch is closed ten.

01:08:27.010 --> 01:08:29.291
It's all right, Clare.

01:08:29.326 --> 01:08:31.028
He's with me.

01:08:31.063 --> 01:08:32.731
Same again, love.

01:08:39.532 --> 01:08:42.178
You look like shit.

01:08:42.212 --> 01:08:44.893
Up all night. What's your excuse?

01:08:44.928 --> 01:08:46.573
I've got my weaknesses, lad.

01:08:48.254 --> 01:08:49.974
Paula Garland one of them?

01:08:54.095 --> 01:08:56.175
Me and Paula go back a long way.

01:08:56.210 --> 01:08:57.615
Old friends.

01:09:00.656 --> 01:09:02.895
I like this place.

01:09:02.930 --> 01:09:04.741
It's private.

01:09:04.776 --> 01:09:06.502
Just the wogs and us.

01:09:06.537 --> 01:09:08.457
That's how I like things, private.

01:09:11.136 --> 01:09:13.058
Cheers.

01:09:13.093 --> 01:09:14.943
Cheers.

01:09:14.978 --> 01:09:16.898
Another round, Sammy.

01:09:18.658 --> 01:09:21.783
And bring the pud trolley over.

01:09:21.819 --> 01:09:24.060
I want to show Mr Dunford
some delights.

01:09:25.859 --> 01:09:29.779
I think you know we've got an important
investment over at Hunslet Carr.

01:09:32.020 --> 01:09:33.461
Feast your eyes.

01:09:35.661 --> 01:09:38.421
How about that then?

01:09:38.457 --> 01:09:40.466
Eh?

01:09:40.502 --> 01:09:42.582
Look, it's got little
trees and everything.

01:09:42.618 --> 01:09:45.319
What yer Yanks call a shopping mall.

01:09:45.354 --> 01:09:47.988
You got your high street chains,

01:09:48.023 --> 01:09:51.944
cinema, bowling alleys, caffs,
restaurants, all under one roof.

01:09:51.979 --> 01:09:55.865
Put an 'otel in there and
there's no need to fuck off home.

01:09:55.900 --> 01:09:57.065
Not bad, eh?

01:09:58.745 --> 01:10:04.186
And your pals in the West Yorkshire Police
already cleared the site for you, so...

01:10:04.221 --> 01:10:05.871
Gypos.

01:10:05.906 --> 01:10:09.307
Squatters. That's my land.

01:10:09.342 --> 01:10:12.673
So, what's the problem?

01:10:12.708 --> 01:10:15.788
I've got investors
to look after, haven't I?

01:10:15.823 --> 01:10:17.988
Is Bill Molloy one of them?

01:10:18.023 --> 01:10:20.914
Don't be a cunt.

01:10:20.949 --> 01:10:22.949
Course Bill Molloy's one of them.

01:10:22.984 --> 01:10:24.749
Not the only copper neither.

01:10:24.784 --> 01:10:26.190
Gi' it him, Paul.

01:10:32.711 --> 01:10:35.476
Open it.

01:10:35.511 --> 01:10:37.472
Take a fucking look, lad.

01:10:49.874 --> 01:10:52.914
I apologise for the vile content
of these snaps, Mr Dunford.

01:10:54.514 --> 01:10:56.515
I hear you're a bit of a cunt man.

01:10:59.155 --> 01:11:02.316
Sticks in the craw, doesn't it?

01:11:02.351 --> 01:11:05.476
I mean, how can they do it?

01:11:05.511 --> 01:11:07.201
Who is this?

01:11:07.236 --> 01:11:09.837
Who is it?! Bloody hell.

01:11:10.957 --> 01:11:14.478
That's Councillor William Shaw,
of the Labour Party, that is.

01:11:14.513 --> 01:11:16.963
That's your Man Most Likely
To Succeed.

01:11:16.998 --> 01:11:19.999
He's your nigger in the whatsit
is Councillor Shaw.

01:11:20.034 --> 01:11:21.439
Traitor to the cause.

01:11:23.559 --> 01:11:25.920
It's a scoop, is what it is.

01:11:28.320 --> 01:11:30.280
Ambitious lad like yourself?

01:11:30.315 --> 01:11:32.241
Make your name with this one.

01:11:37.481 --> 01:11:39.082
No, wrong boy, Dawson.

01:11:44.763 --> 01:11:46.843
You gonna to be a failure
all your life, son?

01:11:50.243 --> 01:11:53.644
Come on, Eddie,
I need a little support.

01:11:53.679 --> 01:11:55.969
A little cooperation.

01:11:56.004 --> 01:11:59.125
You play your part, son,
and we'll all get what we want.

01:12:02.806 --> 01:12:04.246
No.

01:12:07.486 --> 01:12:08.446
I'm a journalist.

01:12:13.967 --> 01:12:15.648
Like Barry.

01:12:17.008 --> 01:12:19.248
I respected Barry.

01:12:22.249 --> 01:12:23.689
He was a good man.

01:12:25.369 --> 01:12:28.490
Problem is, he had his own agenda.

01:12:34.491 --> 01:12:36.011
Is that why you had him killed?

01:12:39.091 --> 01:12:42.652
What the fucking hell are you
going to do about it?! Eh, son?

01:12:44.372 --> 01:12:45.933
You're a fucking
student with a notebook!

01:12:45.968 --> 01:12:47.133
I do not want to be part of this!

01:12:48.573 --> 01:12:50.493
Tough shit. You already are.

01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:22.221
All right.
Yes, I went to see John last night.

01:13:22.256 --> 01:13:25.501
I told you he's been very kind...

01:13:25.536 --> 01:13:27.261
You fucked him.

01:13:29.222 --> 01:13:30.467
You fucked John Dawson.

01:13:30.502 --> 01:13:36.703
Me? I'll fuck anything in trousers.

01:13:36.738 --> 01:13:39.543
You shouldn't have said that.

01:13:43.144 --> 01:13:44.584
Go on then.

01:13:52.626 --> 01:13:55.366
What are you going to do?

01:13:55.401 --> 01:13:58.106
You chose to get involved.

01:14:00.827 --> 01:14:03.547
You don't care. You don't really
fucking care at all, do you?

01:14:06.508 --> 01:14:08.113
You just want to rescue me.

01:14:08.148 --> 01:14:11.469
You're not the first.
Think you'll be the last?

01:14:15.629 --> 01:14:17.410
Sorry, sorry.

01:14:17.445 --> 01:14:19.190
I'm sorry.

01:14:21.230 --> 01:14:23.111
Please listen to me.

01:14:27.031 --> 01:14:28.596
Dawson fucks

01:14:28.631 --> 01:14:30.512
who he wants to fuck.

01:15:01.517 --> 01:15:03.117
How long have you known him for?

01:15:11.999 --> 01:15:13.439
All my life.

01:15:34.202 --> 01:15:35.682
Please, I'm sorry. Don't go.

01:15:45.964 --> 01:15:48.885
We've got to get out of this place.

01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:51.250
What?

01:15:51.285 --> 01:15:53.165
We've got to get out of Yorkshire.

01:15:56.286 --> 01:15:57.131
I can't.

01:15:57.166 --> 01:15:59.046
Yeah, yeah you can.

01:16:11.448 --> 01:16:13.609
They've got sunshine down south.

01:16:19.810 --> 01:16:22.050
They've got sea view flats.

01:16:24.250 --> 01:16:26.011
Warm summer breezes.

01:16:38.413 --> 01:16:41.173
Just go there right
now and never come back.

01:16:49.535 --> 01:16:50.775
Pack a bag.

01:16:56.616 --> 01:16:59.856
OK. I'll be back
in a couple of hours, all right?

01:17:18.539 --> 01:17:21.420
All right. So, you're one of the good
ones, aren't you, Sergeant Fraser?

01:17:21.455 --> 01:17:23.065
You are.

01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:25.340
Not many of them left.

01:17:31.421 --> 01:17:33.702
This is Barry Gannon's
life's work.

01:17:35.782 --> 01:17:38.783
This is high level corruption,
business,

01:17:38.818 --> 01:17:41.783
local government,
West Yorkshire Police...

01:17:41.818 --> 01:17:42.623
Who in particular?

01:17:42.658 --> 01:17:43.583
Have a look.

01:17:50.104 --> 01:17:51.265
Is this too hot for you?

01:18:08.307 --> 01:18:10.428
Thought I could do it but I can't.

01:18:21.670 --> 01:18:23.110
Look after that.

01:18:40.153 --> 01:18:42.753
# Hang in there, baby
Make love tonight

01:18:44.873 --> 01:18:46.359
# Don't be afraid.

01:18:46.394 --> 01:18:47.759
# Gonna make it all right

01:18:47.794 --> 01:18:52.515
# Ooh, I know just how you feel
Wanna hold you tight

01:18:52.550 --> 01:18:54.395
# We've almost got it made

01:18:57.115 --> 01:19:01.196
# Now that we've caressed... #

01:19:27.400 --> 01:19:29.321
Paula!

01:19:56.325 --> 01:19:57.765
Paula!

01:20:29.370 --> 01:20:33.376
# Sad, sweet dreamer!

01:20:33.411 --> 01:20:37.172
# It's just one of those things
you put down to experience... #

01:20:44.813 --> 01:20:48.214
Looking after that special
relationship, are we, Mr Hadden?

01:20:48.249 --> 01:20:52.574
#.. Been another blue
day without you, girl

01:20:52.609 --> 01:20:55.940
# Been another sad summer song

01:20:55.975 --> 01:21:02.096
# Been thinking about you, girl
all night long

01:21:06.017 --> 01:21:09.742
# Been another sad tear on my pillow

01:21:09.777 --> 01:21:14.418
# Been another memory to tell me
you're the one, girl

01:21:16.058 --> 01:21:19.099
# Been thinking about you, girl
all night long! #

01:21:19.134 --> 01:21:21.944
Eddie, lad.

01:21:21.979 --> 01:21:24.785
Some people
I'd like you to meet, son.

01:21:24.820 --> 01:21:28.080
I want to see Paula.
That's all I want to do.

01:21:28.115 --> 01:21:31.341
I'm not interested in your
filthy little world.

01:21:31.376 --> 01:21:33.181
I just want to see Paula.

01:21:33.216 --> 01:21:34.901
Paula's gone, son.

01:21:34.936 --> 01:21:36.547
Long gone.

01:21:36.582 --> 01:21:38.982
Come on. You know that, don't you?

01:21:40.662 --> 01:21:43.588
Where is she?

01:21:43.623 --> 01:21:45.503
Let it go, lad.
Let me introduce you to...

01:21:45.538 --> 01:21:46.508
Paula!

01:21:46.543 --> 01:21:47.623
Eddie, lad.

01:21:47.658 --> 01:21:48.944
Paula!

01:21:50.424 --> 01:21:52.424
Paula! Paula!

01:21:52.459 --> 01:21:54.424
I said...

01:21:55.985 --> 01:21:58.550
Tell them about the others.

01:21:58.585 --> 01:22:01.026
You need the beautiful new carpets.

01:22:01.061 --> 01:22:03.146
It's way past your bedtime.

01:22:08.787 --> 01:22:10.187
Where is she?

01:22:13.268 --> 01:22:15.548
Paula! Paula!

01:22:40.272 --> 01:22:43.632
Is he bleeding yet?

01:22:43.667 --> 01:22:45.153
He is now.

01:22:49.353 --> 01:22:50.354
Come on, sunshine.

01:23:01.675 --> 01:23:04.556
Argh! Go away!

01:23:06.316 --> 01:23:06.916
Woohoo!

01:24:23.969 --> 01:24:25.409
What is it?

01:24:28.850 --> 01:24:29.810
What is it?

01:24:33.731 --> 01:24:36.151
Take a seat.

01:24:36.186 --> 01:24:38.571
Take a seat?

01:24:38.606 --> 01:24:39.772
OK.

01:24:58.175 --> 01:24:59.615
Put your hands...

01:25:02.375 --> 01:25:04.216
.. flat down on this. Like me.

01:25:05.776 --> 01:25:07.101
Go on.

01:25:07.136 --> 01:25:08.416
Put them down flat.

01:25:08.451 --> 01:25:10.297
Come on!

01:26:37.663 --> 01:26:39.503
Look at her!

01:26:39.538 --> 01:26:41.300
Look at her!

01:26:41.335 --> 01:26:43.029
Forensics, lad.

01:26:43.064 --> 01:26:44.869
You're all over her clothes,

01:26:44.904 --> 01:26:47.724
in her flat,
under her finger nails, up her cunt.

01:26:47.759 --> 01:26:50.545
You're all over her.
You did it, didn't you, eh?

01:26:50.580 --> 01:26:52.462
Go on, say it.

01:26:52.497 --> 01:26:54.346
Say you did it.

01:26:54.381 --> 01:26:55.506
Bill.

01:26:56.586 --> 01:26:58.386
Stay with him.

01:27:25.671 --> 01:27:27.231
I didn't do it.

01:27:34.472 --> 01:27:36.232
I didn't do it. I loved her.

01:27:39.073 --> 01:27:41.313
Of course you didn't do it.

01:27:43.354 --> 01:27:45.394
We know who did though, don't we?

01:27:45.429 --> 01:27:46.834
Eh?

01:27:48.594 --> 01:27:49.995
Don't we lad, eh?

01:28:25.560 --> 01:28:27.521
Keep fucking still!

01:28:27.556 --> 01:28:28.961
Behave!

01:28:37.762 --> 01:28:41.003
That's it. Oh, shit! Oh, fuck.

01:28:41.038 --> 01:28:42.420
Fuck! What?

01:28:42.455 --> 01:28:43.803
Say, "Do it. "

01:28:43.838 --> 01:28:44.329
No!

01:28:44.364 --> 01:28:46.124
Yeah, now, now! Now!

01:28:57.046 --> 01:28:58.571
No!

01:28:58.606 --> 01:29:00.611
No, please!

01:29:00.646 --> 01:29:03.767
We were joking. No!

01:29:06.327 --> 01:29:09.488
Are you all right, lad?
Are you all right, lad?

01:29:09.523 --> 01:29:11.368
Just joking, just joking.

01:29:14.649 --> 01:29:16.429
Come on.

01:29:16.464 --> 01:29:18.174
Now these,

01:29:18.209 --> 01:29:21.570
these are a different
ball game altogether, son.

01:29:21.605 --> 01:29:23.135
These are real.

01:29:23.170 --> 01:29:26.730
Relax, it's all over now, mate.
This is the easy bit here.

01:29:26.766 --> 01:29:29.491
Give me that.
Put it in his pocket.

01:29:31.331 --> 01:29:33.257
Right,

01:29:33.292 --> 01:29:36.492
now you are going
to do us a little favour.

01:29:36.527 --> 01:29:39.533
OK? Come here. Come with me.

01:29:42.333 --> 01:29:44.338
You see this?

01:29:44.373 --> 01:29:46.414
This is the North.

01:29:46.449 --> 01:29:48.454
We do what we want.

01:32:12.958 --> 01:32:13.958
Hello!

01:32:34.281 --> 01:32:36.362
The others?

01:32:38.762 --> 01:32:42.323
Beneath the beautiful carpets.

01:32:42.358 --> 01:32:45.883
He always used to be so careful.

01:32:53.204 --> 01:32:54.565
Where is he?

01:32:56.165 --> 01:32:58.205
Eh?

01:33:00.966 --> 01:33:03.406
Well...?

01:33:11.207 --> 01:33:13.128
'Eddie, is that you?'

01:33:15.968 --> 01:33:18.168
I didn't do one good thing, did I?

01:33:24.289 --> 01:33:26.290
'Please come home, love. '

01:33:29.170 --> 01:33:31.531
No. I'm sorry.

01:33:31.566 --> 01:33:33.048
I can't.

01:33:33.083 --> 01:33:34.531
Bye, Mum.

01:34:37.981 --> 01:34:38.942
Look who's here.

01:34:52.864 --> 01:34:56.945
Well, all this
over a fucking shopping centre!

01:34:58.545 --> 01:34:59.985
Fucking hell.

01:35:06.386 --> 01:35:08.466
All of it your fault, son.

01:35:10.187 --> 01:35:12.672
That prick of yours,

01:35:12.707 --> 01:35:14.467
leads you where you shouldn't go.

01:35:23.629 --> 01:35:25.309
What about the children?

01:35:26.909 --> 01:35:28.850
Wolf does for John.

01:35:28.885 --> 01:35:30.755
Private weakness.

01:35:30.790 --> 01:35:33.471
Fucking hell, I'm no angel.

01:35:33.506 --> 01:35:34.871
Wolf does for John.

01:37:42.812 --> 01:37:45.012
'They got sunshine down south.

01:37:46.612 --> 01:37:48.053
'And warm summer breezes.

01:37:50.573 --> 01:37:52.733
'Just go there right now
and never come back. '
