01:24.959 --> 01:27.587
<i>As explained</i>
<i>by my physics teacher Mr. Myrick</i>

01:27.670 --> 01:28.880
<i>in excruciating detail...</i>

01:32.425 --> 01:34.260
<i>Newton's third law states that</i>

01:34.344 --> 01:37.138
<i>every action has an equal</i>
<i>and opposite reaction.</i>

01:38.932 --> 01:43.520
<i>Once an action is taken...</i>
<i>you must live with the consequences.</i>

02:27.647 --> 02:28.690
Shit!

02:48.042 --> 02:49.919
-One of those for me?

02:53.256 --> 02:54.924
What the hell? Mom?

03:02.223 --> 03:03.349
What the...?

03:06.394 --> 03:10.064
Ashley. Sorry, didn't see you.
What are you doing on the floor?

03:10.148 --> 03:12.483
-Oh, my God, Ash!

03:15.028 --> 03:15.987
Ashley?

03:16.070 --> 03:17.071
Noah, call 911.

03:17.155 --> 03:19.449
I called, I'm gonna go out
to the street to wait.

04:32.689 --> 04:33.523
Cal?

04:35.942 --> 04:37.735
-What's going on?
-Where's Cal?

04:37.819 --> 04:38.653
I don't know.

04:58.298 --> 05:01.009
Jesus. A Shambler. Theo, weapons.

05:04.012 --> 05:05.888
What is a Shambler doing here?

05:05.972 --> 05:07.807
I don't know, but he's about to get out.

05:07.890 --> 05:09.642
Please let me take him out.

05:13.730 --> 05:17.233
That asshole's destroying my kitchen.
This one's mine.

06:34.310 --> 06:37.230
How the hell did these kids
get this much alcohol?

06:37.772 --> 06:40.108
Same way they got all the pot, I guess.

07:43.004 --> 07:45.548
-What the hell's it doing?
-It's looking for something.

07:45.631 --> 07:47.508
What would it be looking for?

07:49.802 --> 07:51.762
-What is that?
-That's a Summoner.

07:51.846 --> 07:54.974
-I found it at the cemetery.
-You brought a Summoner into the house?

07:55.057 --> 07:56.893
Obviously, I didn't know what it was.

08:11.657 --> 08:13.701
You get that damn head off my rug.

09:00.248 --> 09:02.667
Juliette Anastasia Fairmont.

09:06.712 --> 09:09.882
Do you have any idea what time it is?

09:14.887 --> 09:15.846
Sebastian.

09:18.349 --> 09:19.475
Mom, don't.

09:24.063 --> 09:25.856
-Did you?
-What is it?

09:32.238 --> 09:33.406
Her first kill.

09:36.367 --> 09:37.827
Juliette, is that true?

09:38.828 --> 09:39.745
Is what true?

09:42.164 --> 09:43.124
You didn't.

09:44.375 --> 09:45.209
I...

09:49.171 --> 09:51.257
It happened so fast.

09:51.340 --> 09:53.676
I knew your instinct would take over.

09:53.759 --> 09:56.637
We will handle everything.
Your father will dispose of the body.

09:57.388 --> 09:58.222
Who was it?

09:58.306 --> 10:00.850
What matters is that it's done

10:00.933 --> 10:05.354
and now we can finally have your sister's
consecration ceremony next Sunday.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.106
I can't do it next Sunday.

10:07.189 --> 10:09.817
Ben is picking me up
and we have to paint the sets.

10:09.900 --> 10:11.235
Juliette.

10:11.319 --> 10:13.404
The full moon after the first kill.

10:13.946 --> 10:18.576
It was the same for Elinor
and 2,000 years of Legacies before her.

10:21.329 --> 10:22.246
Um...

10:23.873 --> 10:24.874
I'm really tired.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.876
Of course you are. Yes.

10:27.960 --> 10:29.462
Go, sweetheart, go.

10:30.004 --> 10:31.422
Get some rest.

10:32.840 --> 10:35.509
There's no bigger day
in a young Legacy's life

10:35.593 --> 10:37.470
than the consecration ceremony.

10:39.221 --> 10:42.266
-The Monster's Ball?
-Don't be so colloquial, dear.

10:42.350 --> 10:43.684
Beauty rest, now.

10:52.401 --> 10:56.864
I'm sure that the Braccos
will fly in from Tuscany and...

10:59.950 --> 11:01.118
I have to call my mother.

11:02.411 --> 11:03.746
It's the middle of the night.

11:04.497 --> 11:05.581
Mm-hm.

11:06.082 --> 11:08.084
Our baby girl is finally grown up.

11:09.043 --> 11:10.586
Who cares what time it is?

11:32.149 --> 11:34.485
At what point will you apologize
for this shit show?

11:35.027 --> 11:36.862
Apologize? For what?

11:38.239 --> 11:41.826
You took something that wasn't yours,
and it brought that thing into our house.

11:43.202 --> 11:45.454
We don't treasure hunt
in graveyards, Apollo.

11:45.538 --> 11:47.540
I already have a father, Theo.

11:47.623 --> 11:50.126
Yeah, and you lucky he isn't here.

11:50.209 --> 11:53.379
You know that thing
that you just had to have,

11:53.462 --> 11:57.675
it literally teleported that goddamn
Shambler into our home.

11:57.758 --> 12:02.096
It allowed it to bypass all the barriers
the Guardians had put in place.

12:02.179 --> 12:08.018
Our house is trash because
you can't follow one simple rule.

12:09.228 --> 12:10.896
Don't steal shit.

12:14.692 --> 12:16.610
Yeah, we could have been killed.

12:18.612 --> 12:21.157
Okay. I get it.

12:22.658 --> 12:25.244
But what was it doing in the cemetery
in the first place?

12:25.828 --> 12:27.913
People don't just go around
dropping Summoners.

12:29.790 --> 12:32.084
Yeah, and hunters don't go around
picking them up.

12:35.838 --> 12:37.631
It's the last picture I have of my mom.

12:43.012 --> 12:46.140
-I'm sorry, it's my bad. I'll fix it.
-I don't want you to fix it.

12:47.266 --> 12:48.684
She made that frame.

12:50.060 --> 12:52.146
I want you to think before you act.

12:54.064 --> 12:56.901
Oh. Is that why
you have a stick up your ass

12:56.984 --> 12:59.195
-because you think before you act?
-Do something!

12:59.278 --> 13:01.322
Both of you! Shut up.

13:01.405 --> 13:03.699
And clean up before I lose my temper.

13:27.640 --> 13:28.474
Hey.

13:29.809 --> 13:33.437
What do you think you're doing?
Do you think I didn't see you?

13:33.521 --> 13:35.856
-Mom, I...
-Get in the house, now.

13:40.945 --> 13:41.862
Where have you been?

13:42.404 --> 13:46.033
I know, I'm sorry. I lost track
of time and I was gonna call--

13:46.116 --> 13:47.368
No. We're Guild, Cal.

13:48.077 --> 13:49.995
We don't lose track of anything.

13:50.079 --> 13:52.706
-The first thing that you do is--
-I staked a vampire.

13:54.583 --> 13:57.002
-What the hell are you talking about?
-My first kill.

13:59.255 --> 14:00.089
I guess.

14:01.298 --> 14:03.425
I staked her. She passed out. I ran.

14:03.509 --> 14:05.928
Passed out? What, like, just collapsed?

14:06.011 --> 14:07.429
She didn't disintegrate?

14:10.641 --> 14:13.769
-Okay, then she wasn't a vampire, Cal.
-She was. She definitely was.

14:14.436 --> 14:16.939
When you stake a vampire, you'll know.

14:17.731 --> 14:18.816
There is no doubt.

14:18.899 --> 14:22.152
-There's fire and ash. Immediately.
-Usually, I know.

14:22.236 --> 14:24.405
Theo just killed one at the cemetery,
remember?

14:26.156 --> 14:27.783
I don't know why this one didn't.

14:30.202 --> 14:33.622
Okay. All right,
we'll discuss this in the morning.

14:34.373 --> 14:35.207
Go to bed.

15:25.299 --> 15:26.300
You scared me.

15:26.383 --> 15:29.136
You scared me. You see anything yet?

15:30.012 --> 15:31.680
This is the first one Dad took down.

15:32.514 --> 15:34.475
Hey, sweetie, just relax.

15:34.558 --> 15:36.644
-Relax.
-Sorry.

15:41.023 --> 15:42.232
Well, that was easy.

16:05.589 --> 16:08.801
The worst monsters are the ones
who appear to be human.

16:09.760 --> 16:11.804
Never forget that.

16:16.433 --> 16:17.434
Calliope.

16:20.604 --> 16:21.438
Get up.

16:25.067 --> 16:28.487
-Why you standing over me like that?
-Get up. Come with me.

16:53.887 --> 16:56.640
Ms. Fairmont. You shouldn't be in here.

16:57.224 --> 17:00.602
Malcolm. You are spending
too much time with the dead.

17:00.686 --> 17:02.229
It's ruining your manners.

17:02.813 --> 17:04.982
-What do you want?
-Money, power,

17:05.065 --> 17:06.900
the perfect little black dress.

17:07.568 --> 17:08.944
I hear you have a body.

17:09.903 --> 17:10.821
It is a morgue.

17:14.742 --> 17:16.660
I assume you mean the Stanton girl.

17:20.456 --> 17:24.835
Relax, I work for
the District Attorney's Office, remember?

17:25.794 --> 17:26.962
As a paid intern.

17:27.046 --> 17:28.547
Who works for her father.

17:29.840 --> 17:31.383
Ashley Stanton.

17:32.342 --> 17:33.469
Seventeen.

17:33.552 --> 17:37.014
So much sadder when they're young,
too much of a good time?

17:38.348 --> 17:39.850
Her liver was excised.

17:41.643 --> 17:43.270
Sound like a good time to you?

17:44.688 --> 17:45.898
Show me the body.

17:45.981 --> 17:48.942
-You gotta be kidding.
-I'm not squeamish, promise.

18:16.720 --> 18:18.263
She still has blood in her veins.

18:20.599 --> 18:22.392
I swear, it's happening again.

18:25.145 --> 18:27.981
I saw bodies like this
when I just started.

18:28.607 --> 18:31.944
Corpses ripped open, organs missing.

18:32.986 --> 18:34.905
You're too young to remember
that Savannah.

18:36.782 --> 18:37.741
Have you seen enough?

18:37.825 --> 18:40.452
-I gotta get this written up and...
-Malcolm.

18:41.453 --> 18:42.788
It was a head injury.

18:44.665 --> 18:49.628
-What?
-There's no sign of anything monstrous.

18:49.711 --> 18:51.880
All her organs are intact.

18:51.964 --> 18:54.508
She had a blood alcohol level of .08.

18:54.591 --> 18:57.094
She fell. She hit her head.

18:57.970 --> 18:59.513
Very tragic accident.

19:01.765 --> 19:04.101
Yes. Clearly.

19:05.310 --> 19:06.228
An accident.

19:08.230 --> 19:12.734
Maybe you shouldn't drink bourbon out of
a thermos and pretend it's iced tea.

19:13.610 --> 19:14.987
It's making you sloppy.

19:16.572 --> 19:19.449
Don't worry, I won't tell a soul.

19:26.540 --> 19:29.209
-You said we'd discuss it in the morning.
-This is morning.

19:33.463 --> 19:34.715
I had that nightmare again.

19:38.927 --> 19:39.761
I'm sorry.

19:41.805 --> 19:43.891
You're a hunter who made a mistake.

19:44.892 --> 19:47.019
It's probably gonna bother you
for a long time.

19:48.270 --> 19:50.772
All right. Now do me a favor.

19:51.565 --> 19:54.985
The vampire that you supposedly
staked last night. Show me what you did.

19:56.486 --> 19:59.156
-What?
-I said, show me what you did. Come on.

20:01.783 --> 20:02.743
Um...

20:03.243 --> 20:05.579
So we were in a pantry, kind of close.

20:05.662 --> 20:07.915
Wait, what were you doing in a pantry?

20:09.917 --> 20:10.918
It was a dare.

20:13.629 --> 20:16.715
Anyway, she leaned in,
and I saw her fangs.

20:18.008 --> 20:18.842
So I just...

20:21.720 --> 20:25.307
I said exactly what you did.

20:28.393 --> 20:29.228
Again.

20:34.983 --> 20:35.817
Again.

20:38.403 --> 20:40.447
Again, Cal.

21:01.093 --> 21:02.511
Your form is perfect.

21:08.475 --> 21:11.144
-And you're sure you saw her fangs?
-Yes.

21:14.815 --> 21:15.649
Okay.

21:17.150 --> 21:17.985
All right.

21:18.610 --> 21:19.611
You go to school.

21:20.529 --> 21:24.658
All right? You keep your head down
and your eyes open.

21:24.741 --> 21:25.742
-Got it?
-Yes.

21:28.787 --> 21:29.621
Okay.

21:31.540 --> 21:32.374
Come on.

21:41.091 --> 21:41.925
What's wrong?

21:43.468 --> 21:44.803
Uh...

21:44.886 --> 21:48.515
Detective Orr dropped that off.
Juliette left it at the party.

21:49.725 --> 21:52.227
A head wound. Why would Juliette do that?

21:52.311 --> 21:53.478
Oh.

21:53.562 --> 21:54.896
It was her first kill.

21:55.605 --> 21:58.692
So maybe she got a little carried away.

21:58.775 --> 22:00.027
Don't be so worried.

22:00.819 --> 22:02.321
This was more than carried away.

22:04.072 --> 22:06.450
We don't slaughter, Margot. We feed.

22:06.533 --> 22:08.452
So yeah, I'm worried.

22:09.244 --> 22:10.162
I know you are.

22:11.079 --> 22:12.581
Residual humanity.

22:14.291 --> 22:17.711
I'm worried because I don't want Juliette
to become anything like him.

22:21.465 --> 22:22.841
She's nothing like him.

22:43.362 --> 22:45.614
Lettie.

22:49.159 --> 22:51.912
Let's recap. Party, party, party.
Blackout, lights up.

22:51.995 --> 22:54.206
Mortally-wounded girl
discovered at my feet.

22:54.289 --> 22:55.957
Ben cradles dying girl.

22:56.041 --> 22:59.836
-I don't want to use the word hero.
-Wait, back up, someone died?

23:02.589 --> 23:04.883
-Who?
-Ashley Stanton.

23:05.967 --> 23:06.802
Wait, what?

23:07.636 --> 23:10.597
-Smashley's dead?
-Yeah, how do you not know that?

23:14.309 --> 23:17.062
Have you ever taken credit
for something that you didn't do

23:17.145 --> 23:19.064
because it was such a big deal to everyone

23:19.147 --> 23:21.400
-and you didn't want to disappoint?
-Someone died.

23:21.483 --> 23:26.196
And you were nowhere to be found.
I sent 4 e-mails, 13 texts, called twice.

23:26.279 --> 23:27.280
Explain.

23:31.118 --> 23:33.203
Were you still in the closet
with the new girl?

23:34.913 --> 23:36.498
Oh, of course you were.

23:37.749 --> 23:39.418
Did you guys kiss?

23:39.501 --> 23:42.462
Did limbs entwine?

23:42.546 --> 23:44.339
Your lives change forever?

23:44.423 --> 23:45.549
Um...

23:46.758 --> 23:49.094
Yes, absolutely forever.

23:49.177 --> 23:50.303
Aw.

23:51.638 --> 23:53.598
Don't be shy now. Come on.

23:55.142 --> 23:57.144
-I've bared my freaking soul to you.
-Wait!

23:57.227 --> 23:59.020
Just tell me what happened to Smashley.

24:00.939 --> 24:04.776
They say she fell and hit her head.
I don't know. I was there.

24:07.612 --> 24:08.613
So much blood.

24:11.700 --> 24:13.243
Common with head injuries.

24:14.244 --> 24:16.246
There's a vigil tonight,
you're going, right?

24:17.372 --> 24:18.415
What?

24:19.207 --> 24:20.333
Yeah, of course.

24:21.585 --> 24:24.629
-You?
-I was basically her hospice nurse.

24:24.713 --> 24:26.089
Of course I'm going.

25:04.377 --> 25:07.506
<i>I'm Natalie Tate,</i>

25:17.015 --> 25:20.143
<i>The family is still making</i>
<i>final servicearrangements,</i>

25:20.227 --> 25:24.314
<i>but did share that Ashley will be</i>
<i>laid torestatOakHillsCemetery.</i>

25:24.397 --> 25:25.941
<i>Ashley was an only child...</i>

25:26.024 --> 25:27.651
-Hi, Dad.
-Hi.

25:28.360 --> 25:30.278
How's the file organizing going?

25:30.779 --> 25:32.405
Finished two days ago.

25:32.489 --> 25:36.535
I paid a visit to Malcolm down at County,
not that he'll remember.

25:39.287 --> 25:42.332
No one asked you to do that.
I was handling it.

25:45.460 --> 25:49.589
He was about to start blabbering about
monsters being back in Savannah.

25:50.298 --> 25:51.258
I was trying to help.

25:52.968 --> 25:55.595
Well, the problem with your help, Elinor,

25:55.679 --> 25:59.266
is that your talent
is uncharted territory.

25:59.349 --> 26:01.601
I don't have it.
Your mother doesn't have it.

26:01.685 --> 26:04.229
And until we understand why you do
and your twin doesn't,

26:04.312 --> 26:07.399
we have asked you not to use it.
Return the file now.

26:07.482 --> 26:11.027
I can't believe you'd compare
anything about me to Oliver.

26:11.111 --> 26:14.864
You don't see me collecting dead squirrels
just so I have something to play with.

26:14.948 --> 26:17.033
Besides, you should be thanking me.

26:18.118 --> 26:21.371
Our Juliette did quite the number
on poor Ashley.

26:21.955 --> 26:23.623
Head wound. I heard.

26:24.291 --> 26:26.918
Did you hear she ripped out
the girl's liver?

26:28.753 --> 26:32.132
Maybe your baby girl doesn't
take after you as much as you thought.

26:36.720 --> 26:39.097
-Thank you, Elinor. You can go.

26:39.723 --> 26:45.437
Great. I'm sure I can find something
to file or copy or erase.

26:59.451 --> 27:02.662
-Must be the Burns Brothers.
-I'm Theo. This is Apollo.

27:02.746 --> 27:03.872
Mr. Sticky Fingers.

27:05.749 --> 27:06.958
What the hell?

27:07.042 --> 27:09.377
It's Mr. Cook with the Guild.
He'll be joining us.

27:09.461 --> 27:10.462
Standard debrief.

27:11.171 --> 27:13.131
When there's an incident,
there's a meeting.

27:13.214 --> 27:16.676
Since your little scavenger hunt caused
the incident, welcome to the meeting.

27:17.302 --> 27:20.430
So brought a Summoner into your house,
bad move.

27:20.513 --> 27:23.516
-Yeah, I know. Don't need another lecture.
-I think you do.

27:25.518 --> 27:27.812
There was a time that everyone
knew about monsters.

27:27.896 --> 27:30.815
People were careful about
what they looked in the eye, touched...

27:31.900 --> 27:35.278
Time eats away at memory, and vigilance.

27:37.155 --> 27:39.240
-What the hell are you rambling about?
-Apollo.

27:42.494 --> 27:43.411
Do you have it?

27:45.163 --> 27:45.997
The Summoner.

27:50.418 --> 27:51.628
Whoa.

27:54.297 --> 27:58.677
You don't take a 3,000-year-old monster
Summoner out of its protective bag.

27:58.760 --> 28:00.387
Do we, Apollo?

28:01.137 --> 28:03.306
Not unless we want to fill the bar
with wraiths.

28:05.934 --> 28:06.768
It's damaged.

28:08.186 --> 28:10.105
-That happened during the melee?
-Not sure.

28:10.897 --> 28:12.691
Why don't you get the Shambler here
and ask it?

28:12.774 --> 28:13.900
-Apollo.
-What?

28:13.983 --> 28:16.903
He wants to ask me a dumb question,
he gets a dumb answer.

28:16.986 --> 28:18.697
Okay, here's an idea.

28:18.780 --> 28:22.283
Take that giant chip off your shoulder
and just tell me exactly what happened.

28:33.753 --> 28:36.089
-Hey, sweetie, got a minute?
-Yeah.

28:38.550 --> 28:39.634
Uh...

28:41.678 --> 28:45.974
First of all, I know I didn't
fall all over myself last night

28:46.057 --> 28:48.143
when you broke the big news, but, um...

28:50.520 --> 28:51.855
I'm incredibly happy for you.

28:53.148 --> 28:55.358
And proud. Congratulations.

28:59.612 --> 29:01.072
Thanks, Dad.

29:04.492 --> 29:07.579
-Ah. Almost forgot, this belongs to you.
-Oh.

29:07.662 --> 29:10.081
God. I've been calling it all day.

29:10.165 --> 29:14.210
Yeah, you left it at the party last night.

29:15.587 --> 29:19.215
Might want to be more careful
what you leave near your bodies.

29:22.343 --> 29:23.178
Sorry.

29:27.015 --> 29:27.849
What?

29:28.475 --> 29:31.895
Amanda Victoria.
Surprised to see her still hanging around.

29:31.978 --> 29:35.190
Yeah. Survived the great
stuffed animal purge of 2018.

29:35.273 --> 29:36.316
Lucky girl.

29:37.066 --> 29:39.652
I remember when you were little
and you were scared of thunder.

29:39.736 --> 29:43.323
Uh-- I wasn't scared of thunder.
Amanda Victoria was.

29:43.406 --> 29:45.825
Well, that's what I meant.
You were so sweet with her.

29:46.659 --> 29:49.037
You would cuddle her, and you would say,

29:50.121 --> 29:52.081
"Everything is gonna be okay."

29:53.041 --> 29:56.669
And Elinor used to put her dolls
in the microwave.

29:58.296 --> 29:59.964
She thought they were cold.

30:02.133 --> 30:04.010
You had compassion.

30:08.556 --> 30:09.432
You still do.

30:12.727 --> 30:14.437
Mom says it's a weakness.

30:16.064 --> 30:16.898
Your mom.

30:18.942 --> 30:19.776
I love her.

30:21.694 --> 30:25.907
But she is a different breed, literally.

30:29.077 --> 30:30.703
And I'm more like my dad.

30:32.622 --> 30:35.959
She tells me all the time
and not like it's a compliment.

30:38.002 --> 30:38.837
Listen to me.

30:42.048 --> 30:43.383
Compassion is not a weakness.

30:45.260 --> 30:46.219
It is a gift.

30:47.762 --> 30:48.805
To be embraced.

30:53.184 --> 30:54.394
I'll try to remember that.

30:55.395 --> 30:56.604
I have faith in you.

30:59.190 --> 31:03.570
I believe that the next time you take
a life, you will show some restraint.

31:08.616 --> 31:09.450
Dad, I, um...

31:10.952 --> 31:13.162
-Dad, I didn't...
-Sweetie, it's okay.

31:14.205 --> 31:15.582
You got a little carried away.

31:16.624 --> 31:17.750
First-time jitters.

31:20.211 --> 31:23.172
Remind me to tell you
my first kill story sometime.

31:38.897 --> 31:41.608
Then the lights came on and I saw her.

31:42.567 --> 31:45.904
I knew that our beloved Ashley Stanton,

31:47.238 --> 31:50.366
Beer Pong Champion, was gone.

31:53.077 --> 31:54.746
She slipped away in my arms.

31:55.330 --> 31:58.833
-I thought she died at the hospital.
-I saw the light leave her eyes, okay?

32:12.138 --> 32:13.264
This is so awkward.

32:14.307 --> 32:15.683
I didn't even know her.

32:19.729 --> 32:21.397
Do you see the vampire you staked?

32:27.153 --> 32:29.197
No, not yet.

32:30.698 --> 32:31.532
Okay. Come on.

32:44.879 --> 32:49.968
<i>♪ Are you ready for</i>
<i>What's coming down...?</i>

32:52.971 --> 32:54.138
You like that, don't you?

32:55.473 --> 32:56.766
Want me to be gentle?

32:57.517 --> 32:59.227
No, baby, I want you to make it hurt.

33:02.814 --> 33:03.815
Ow!

33:03.898 --> 33:05.149
Wait.

33:29.966 --> 33:31.175
This never happened.

33:34.554 --> 33:35.596
Never happened.

33:37.682 --> 33:38.975
See you next week.

34:01.914 --> 34:05.418
Thank you, Principal Waters,
for organizing this so quickly.

34:06.210 --> 34:08.713
We're grateful to see so many of you here.

34:09.422 --> 34:13.509
Ashley had so many friends.
Her phone never stopped ringing.

34:14.343 --> 34:16.679
We called Ashley our social butterfly.

34:17.555 --> 34:20.683
Seemed like everywhere she went,
she made friends.

34:21.976 --> 34:25.354
She could strike up a conversation
with absolutely anyone,

34:25.438 --> 34:27.523
and they'd walk away smiling.

34:28.316 --> 34:29.525
It was a true gift.

34:30.610 --> 34:32.820
Even though academics
were never her strong suit,

34:32.904 --> 34:35.156
she loved coming to school every day.

34:38.159 --> 34:39.243
Now I can see why.

34:40.787 --> 34:45.792
One thing we all know about Ashley,
she never said no to a good time.

34:51.964 --> 34:52.799
Lettie?

34:54.717 --> 34:58.221
I left my physics book in my locker.
I need it. I'll be right back.

35:08.189 --> 35:09.023
Juliette.

35:11.692 --> 35:13.111
Hey, Juliette!

35:22.620 --> 35:23.830
I just want to talk.

35:25.039 --> 35:26.207
Like in the closet?

35:28.251 --> 35:29.335
That was instinct.

35:31.212 --> 35:32.630
I could say the same.

35:57.572 --> 35:59.532
I said, leave me alone.

35:59.615 --> 36:01.659
And I said I just want to talk.

36:42.700 --> 36:43.910
Nowhere to run.

36:45.828 --> 36:48.539
-Why'd you stake me?
-Why'd you bite me?

36:48.623 --> 36:49.457
Because I...

36:52.627 --> 36:55.254
-I wasn't myself.
-You were exactly yourself.

36:56.422 --> 36:59.133
The reason why my family
was sent to Savannah.

36:59.217 --> 37:01.219
And why are your tears red?

37:01.302 --> 37:03.012
-I'm not a monster.
-Back off.

37:14.273 --> 37:15.524
You guys been training too?

37:16.359 --> 37:18.569
No, I was born this way.

37:20.279 --> 37:22.657
-We don't have to do this.
-Of course we do.

37:45.471 --> 37:48.266
Why can't I feel my hand?
What did you do to me?

37:51.852 --> 37:53.771
It's not me, it's my blood.

37:54.897 --> 37:55.815
It paralyzes.

37:56.732 --> 37:57.900
Get away from me!

38:00.987 --> 38:02.071
It'll wear off.

38:12.498 --> 38:17.712
<i>The 16-year-old Stanton is remembered</i>
<i>by her friends as a vivacious young woman</i>

38:17.795 --> 38:21.716
<i>who enjoyed skiing and theater,</i>
<i>while Stanton's parents,</i>

38:21.799 --> 38:23.342
<i>Savannah philanthropists...</i>

38:23.426 --> 38:24.302
Tragic.

38:25.011 --> 38:26.846
<i>...remember their daughter as quote...</i>

38:26.929 --> 38:28.556
Yeah, not the word I'd use.

38:30.599 --> 38:31.434
I'll bite.

38:32.351 --> 38:33.978
What word would you use?

38:34.061 --> 38:35.146
I'd use two.

38:35.980 --> 38:37.523
Cover. And up.

38:38.274 --> 38:39.108
Paranoid.

38:39.942 --> 38:43.195
Sounds like she got drunk and fell.
That so hard to believe?

38:43.279 --> 38:47.533
I've fallen and hit my head a bunch
of times, never lost that much blood.

38:48.701 --> 38:50.328
Maybe you're not doing it right.

38:50.411 --> 38:54.415
<i>The Stantons have called for a full</i>
<i>investigation into their daughter's death.</i>

38:54.498 --> 38:57.001
<i>In lieu of flowers, the family requests...</i>

38:57.084 --> 39:01.839
-My sister goes to that school.
-So did I, but we never partied like that.

39:02.965 --> 39:03.799
Oh, yeah?

39:04.967 --> 39:08.471
Let me guess. Homecoming Queen.

39:09.722 --> 39:10.931
That obvious?

39:12.099 --> 39:13.351
Varsity running back?

39:19.315 --> 39:20.524
Be careful out here.

39:23.444 --> 39:25.821
Have you ever hooked up
in a women's bathroom stall?

39:27.239 --> 39:29.158
No. Can't say I have.

39:31.702 --> 39:32.536
You will.

39:39.418 --> 39:41.379
The roof? Really?

39:41.921 --> 39:44.840
A million no trespassing signs
weren't enough?

39:49.804 --> 39:51.055
I was upset.

39:52.223 --> 39:54.517
Obviously, so I left.

39:55.684 --> 39:59.522
And Calliope was nice enough to follow me
to make sure I was okay.

40:03.776 --> 40:07.363
She was clearly upset,
and I was worried about her,

40:08.447 --> 40:10.491
and it was quiet on the roof.

40:11.283 --> 40:14.453
She needed to process.

40:15.538 --> 40:19.625
Someone on the roof could mean
active shooter, possible jumper.

40:21.544 --> 40:23.421
Oh, just in time.

40:23.504 --> 40:27.258
Sorry about the circumstance,
but always a pleasure to see you.

40:27.341 --> 40:28.300
Thank you for coming.

40:28.384 --> 40:30.052
-Hello, Cyrus.
-Hello.

40:33.639 --> 40:35.099
Thanks for calling.

40:36.308 --> 40:37.143
Hello.

40:39.562 --> 40:40.771
-Talia Burns.
-Hello.

40:43.315 --> 40:45.317
I'm so glad you called,
Principal Waters.

40:46.235 --> 40:50.489
You're just in time to hear your
daughter explain herself, Mrs. Fairmont.

40:53.993 --> 40:56.287
Young lady? We're waiting.

41:02.251 --> 41:03.085
Well?

41:05.212 --> 41:06.505
Um...

41:07.631 --> 41:11.093
Well, it's like Calliope said.

41:14.763 --> 41:17.266
I didn't mean to go onto the roof.

41:19.018 --> 41:25.107
I just started walking and kind
of wanted to go somewhere private.

41:28.360 --> 41:29.695
To think about Ashley.

41:32.990 --> 41:36.202
This all seems like
a big misunderstanding,

41:36.285 --> 41:38.204
doesn't it, Principal Waters?

41:38.787 --> 41:40.748
Girls their age,
they're under so much stress.

41:42.333 --> 41:46.003
School, grades, the loss of a classmate,

41:47.713 --> 41:50.966
and on top of it all, Juliette's
Debutante Ball is this weekend.

41:51.050 --> 41:55.387
Family coming from everywhere,
her proper presentation to society.

41:56.805 --> 41:59.350
I admit that I may have added
to her stress.

42:00.434 --> 42:03.646
You know, it just hasn't been easy
on Calliope, either.

42:04.355 --> 42:07.149
You know, being new,
arriving so late to the semester

42:07.233 --> 42:09.235
and then trying to make friends.

42:12.571 --> 42:14.365
Why don't we let the girls go to class?

42:14.448 --> 42:16.534
I was about to suggest the same.

42:18.494 --> 42:21.914
Oh, I'd be happy to stay
and to talk this through.

42:21.997 --> 42:27.878
Oh, I have ideas to ensure that these
misunderstandings don't happen again.

42:29.880 --> 42:33.092
All right, Ms. Fairmont, Ms. Burns.

42:34.051 --> 42:36.470
I expect you to be on your best behavior.

42:49.858 --> 42:54.572
You know, you're a really shitty liar.
I mean, everyone has a tell, but I just...

42:55.614 --> 42:58.909
I thought monsters like you were supposed
to be good at deceiving humans.

43:00.619 --> 43:03.163
Yeah, well, I guess I'm not very good
at being a monster.

43:05.416 --> 43:06.834
Was everything you said a lie?

43:07.543 --> 43:10.588
I certainly didn't jump up on that rooftop
to make you feel better.

43:13.132 --> 43:13.966
But still.

43:15.342 --> 43:17.386
You were the first person
to welcome me here.

43:18.429 --> 43:20.931
You smiled at me, made me feel...

43:23.309 --> 43:25.185
That was before I realized what you were.

43:29.148 --> 43:30.149
How did you know?

43:31.442 --> 43:35.279
Like I said, everybody has tells
if you look hard enough.

43:38.240 --> 43:39.908
And I couldn't keep my eyes off you.

43:44.204 --> 43:46.540
I know you were planning
on killing me at the party.

43:49.043 --> 43:51.003
When I followed you into that pantry...

43:53.088 --> 43:55.257
all I wanted to do was kiss you.

43:56.091 --> 43:59.011
I've been thinking about it
since you first walked into my class.

44:01.096 --> 44:02.473
I didn't mean to bite you.

44:04.808 --> 44:06.018
But you did.

44:08.520 --> 44:10.731
Would you have staked me if I hadn't?

44:13.025 --> 44:15.944
Yeah. I still would have staked you.

44:27.039 --> 44:29.625
-What?
-I can hear your heartbeat.

44:31.377 --> 44:32.711
It races when you lie.

44:41.595 --> 44:45.683
Girls these days.
I swear I never got in that much trouble.

44:45.766 --> 44:47.017
Oh, I did.

44:49.520 --> 44:51.063
It's not very easy, is it?

44:51.939 --> 44:53.357
Being new in town.

44:53.440 --> 44:56.527
-No. It's not.
-Then why don't we have lunch?

44:57.152 --> 44:58.028
At my house.

44:58.654 --> 45:01.573
And don't say yes, and mean no.

45:01.657 --> 45:04.201
I realize that the girls
got off on the wrong foot,

45:04.284 --> 45:07.579
but that's nothing
a glass of Chardonnay can't fix.

45:09.248 --> 45:10.874
I'm more of a Pinot girl.

45:11.625 --> 45:12.835
Ah.

45:14.086 --> 45:15.796
Margot, you have such lovely skin.

45:15.879 --> 45:18.465
-What's your secret?
-Sunscreen.

45:20.759 --> 45:23.470
How's next Sunday after church?

45:25.013 --> 45:26.682
Great. Yeah, sounds good.

45:26.765 --> 45:30.060
Maybe we can get the girls
to bury this, whatever it is.

45:30.144 --> 45:30.978
Yeah.

45:33.063 --> 45:34.898
I like you, Talia.

45:35.941 --> 45:37.985
I can tell we're gonna be friends.

45:40.279 --> 45:41.196
Next Sunday.

45:41.280 --> 45:42.364
I can't wait.

46:34.416 --> 46:36.001
There you are.

46:36.877 --> 46:39.338
I haven't seen Mom this keyed up
since my own debut.

46:41.298 --> 46:44.176
You know, I can't believe
you actually did it.

46:45.886 --> 46:47.137
Baby's first kill.

46:50.224 --> 46:53.936
Come on, we tell each other everything.
I want to hear all the details.

46:54.937 --> 46:56.605
Not much of a story, really.

46:57.856 --> 47:00.776
I just... bit her.

47:03.320 --> 47:05.280
That's not what I heard.

47:13.914 --> 47:17.251
Did you really have to bash her head open?
And the liver?

47:17.751 --> 47:21.171
What possessed you to take such
a gruesome calling card?

47:25.259 --> 47:28.762
Tell me, was it before
or after you got this?

47:30.055 --> 47:31.390
Who does it belong to?

47:36.895 --> 47:38.438
I don't know. I...

47:40.482 --> 47:41.900
I didn't see their face.

47:43.861 --> 47:45.404
You are a terrible liar.

47:47.114 --> 47:47.990
If you say so.

47:52.286 --> 47:53.704
Sweet little.

47:54.872 --> 47:57.207
When did we start keeping secrets
from each other?

48:00.168 --> 48:02.212
-We don't.
-No.

48:02.296 --> 48:03.130
We don't.

48:04.798 --> 48:07.384
I'm here, when you want to talk.

48:20.439 --> 48:22.608
-Hey, stranger.
-Oh, my God, Tess?

48:24.568 --> 48:25.569
Aunt Sarah.

48:25.652 --> 48:27.613
-So good to see you, Cal.
-Hey.

48:28.196 --> 48:30.657
-Hey, sweet Cal. Hey.
-Uncle Mike.

48:31.366 --> 48:33.285
-How you doing?
-Good.

48:33.368 --> 48:34.202
Hey, kiddo.

48:36.079 --> 48:37.080
Dad.

48:39.625 --> 48:40.959
Why are you back so...

48:44.129 --> 48:45.130
What's going on?

48:46.381 --> 48:49.343
<i>Actions always have</i>
<i>an equal and opposite reaction.</i>

48:50.052 --> 48:51.595
<i>Newton's third law.</i>

48:52.262 --> 48:53.513
You were right.

48:55.057 --> 48:55.891
About...?

48:55.974 --> 48:59.269
You staked her perfectly,
but she's a Legacy vampire.

48:59.353 --> 49:00.896
That's why she didn't die.

49:04.191 --> 49:05.067
I don't understand.

49:05.150 --> 49:08.862
<i>Once an action is taken,</i>
<i>you have to live with the consequences.</i>

49:08.946 --> 49:10.530
Legacies were born vampires.

49:10.614 --> 49:14.076
Their bloodline stretches back
thousands of years.

49:14.701 --> 49:16.244
They believe, to the Garden of Eden.

49:16.328 --> 49:18.038
They aren't even bound to the dark.

49:18.872 --> 49:20.624
Very rare. Hard to find.

49:20.707 --> 49:24.586
And even harder to kill.
But you led us to them, baby girl.

49:24.670 --> 49:25.754
Mm.

49:26.713 --> 49:31.426
Now each and every one of them must die.

49:33.679 --> 49:35.764
<i>I am a member of the Burns family,</i>

49:35.847 --> 49:38.266
<i>a Guild-trained house of monster hunters.</i>

49:38.850 --> 49:40.435
<i>Our hearts drive us.</i>

49:40.978 --> 49:42.813
<i>Duty and logic lead us.</i>

49:43.397 --> 49:47.901
<i>And we vowed to rid the world</i>
<i>ofallmonsters.</i>
