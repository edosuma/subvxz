00:54.217 --> 00:56.578
I'm glad I got away from all this.

01:01.928 --> 01:03.572
I pitty you.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.028
Don't bother.

01:08.389 --> 01:09.440
- Okay.

01:10.368 --> 01:12.613
You want my rep, right?

01:25.994 --> 01:27.127
Then shoot me.

01:36.215 --> 01:37.534
But know this.

01:37.598 --> 01:39.871
You kill me here without
facing me on the street...

01:40.930 --> 01:42.972
you'll be known for what you are...

01:44.217 --> 01:45.606
Scum.

01:46.741 --> 01:48.411
- And you'll be dead.

01:51.114 --> 01:52.595
And me?

01:57.902 --> 02:00.422
I then killed a legend.

02:07.815 --> 02:09.098
Fucking..

02:09.716 --> 02:12.497
A last request, grandad?

02:26.842 --> 02:31.426
- 1 MONTH EARLIER -

04:27.437 --> 04:28.859
What?

04:29.291 --> 04:31.008
- Ahh
Fuck off, huh?

04:31.016 --> 04:32.149
You fucking bitch.

04:35.458 --> 04:36.458
- Ah!

04:38.033 --> 04:39.739
- Uhn..
Ah.

04:40.090 --> 04:42.410
Where do you live, darling?

04:43.244 --> 04:44.381
Ah! Ah!

04:44.773 --> 04:47.531
Tell me, where the fuck
do you live, darling?

04:47.592 --> 04:49.124
She lives over there, c'mon just
fucking leave...

04:49.155 --> 04:51.019
Was he talking to you?

04:51.054 --> 04:52.136
- Alright.

04:53.654 --> 04:56.134
I want your mom to see this.

04:58.164 --> 05:01.961
If she aint gonna teach you any
fucking rules, then I am.

05:04.350 --> 05:05.350
- Aah!

05:11.833 --> 05:15.183
Is there anyone else who
wants to be a grass (snitch)?

05:15.864 --> 05:18.596
This is what happends
when you talk.

05:19.573 --> 05:21.550
- Uh ohhh..

05:43.785 --> 05:45.864
Pay attention.

05:57.015 --> 05:59.654
- Aaahhh!!
Aahhh!

05:59.724 --> 06:01.974
- Aaaah!

06:10.485 --> 06:13.438
I don't want to be doing
shit like this.

06:16.110 --> 06:18.860
Cutting up bitches, and shit.

06:21.438 --> 06:24.742
But this is my square.
My fucking square!

06:29.299 --> 06:32.705
You people better start playing
by my fucking rules, alright?

06:49.182 --> 06:50.854
- I fucking hate you.

06:51.784 --> 06:53.151
I fucking hate you, c'mon.

07:11.537 --> 07:12.701
C'mon!

07:17.350 --> 07:18.529
Get off me.

07:18.601 --> 07:21.711
- You go to the nurse, come.
Get. Off. Me.

07:21.774 --> 07:24.180
- You're coming with me.
Get off me, now.

07:24.219 --> 07:26.031
Get off of me, miss.

07:26.118 --> 07:28.290
- You mind your mouth, young man.
Oh yeah? yeah?

07:28.353 --> 07:30.837
You're gonna regret this,
I swear.

07:35.009 --> 07:37.009
- I don't want to suspend him.

07:37.847 --> 07:40.300
You should,
if it helps.

07:43.794 --> 07:45.138
He needs to learn.

07:46.062 --> 07:47.304
Thank you.

07:47.455 --> 07:51.840
But this is not the kind of conduct
we condone here at Arkequin Park

07:51.909 --> 07:56.838
We don't expect the students to
exhibit such wild behavior.

07:56.907 --> 07:58.399
Thing need to change.

07:58.430 --> 08:00.790
I'm sure it's just boisterous energie.

08:01.708 --> 08:03.754
He's never violent at home.

08:04.923 --> 08:06.369
He's a good natured boy.

08:06.394 --> 08:08.824
But this is not the first
fight he's been in.

08:08.856 --> 08:11.544
Sorry, what is it you are
trying to say about my son?

08:12.682 --> 08:14.299
I'll deal with it.

08:15.340 --> 08:17.668
We all do stupid things when
we are young, I mean...

08:17.694 --> 08:19.922
I know that's not an
excuse, ofcourse, but...

08:19.946 --> 08:22.564
Trust me,
I'll deal with this.

08:23.660 --> 08:26.434
This is a waste of time, the girl
aint gonna speak to us.

08:26.677 --> 08:28.505
We should just pay the scumbags a visit.

08:28.530 --> 08:30.124
That's not how it works.

08:30.159 --> 08:31.942
Well, we should do,
we know what they did.

08:32.058 --> 08:35.765
And our job is to proof it,
or deal with it.

08:35.799 --> 08:39.510
I didn't shank her and his bitch mate
might deserve a beating.

08:39.594 --> 08:43.635
Trust me, Malor, you don't win that way.
- Trust me?

08:43.741 --> 08:45.785
We won't end to fill the
third line of the law.

08:45.809 --> 08:48.044
We should be the one
to administer it.

08:57.043 --> 08:58.024
Good afternoon.

08:58.110 --> 09:00.446
We'd like to talk to you about the
situation that happend with your daughter.

09:00.500 --> 09:03.610
Now, no, no, I've you just listen
because we're trying to help. If you..

09:04.820 --> 09:06.266
That went well.

09:06.442 --> 09:08.169
We should do it my way.

09:24.139 --> 09:25.709
Do me. Do me.

09:26.897 --> 09:28.014
Ooh.

09:30.633 --> 09:32.336
Pull my finger, bro.

09:36.736 --> 09:39.689
She aint gonna fight you.
- You don't know, bro.

09:40.651 --> 09:43.119
Ladies like touching up young boys.

09:43.175 --> 09:45.526
Listen, you little prick.

09:45.668 --> 09:47.832
We know what you did.

09:51.393 --> 09:53.690
Ah, you're old, man.

09:54.122 --> 09:55.880
What, did you get bullied at school?

09:55.996 --> 09:57.175
Was it a classic one?

09:57.204 --> 09:59.556
Or did your powers just fuck off,
when you took your badge?

09:59.610 --> 10:01.657
It's usually one of the two.

10:01.682 --> 10:03.994
Yeah, do you wanna hit me?
Hit me, bro.

10:04.073 --> 10:06.495
I'm here, just hit me.
Come on.

10:06.543 --> 10:07.879
Give me a little whack.

10:07.918 --> 10:10.965
Just a little dig, go on.
Nah, nah, nah don't actually. Yeah, go on.

10:11.012 --> 10:13.947
Give me a little slap, good.
Now, give me a fucking slap.

10:14.005 --> 10:16.116
Yeah.
- Turn around.

10:16.227 --> 10:18.196
Is that all we're doing
down here, guys?

10:18.224 --> 10:20.590
Yeah?
Slashing girls in their face?

10:23.046 --> 10:26.633
Fat boy. Skinny boy.
Fuck off.

10:29.611 --> 10:30.785
Move.

10:43.785 --> 10:45.886
So is this how you get a name?

10:49.643 --> 10:50.839
Coward.

10:51.271 --> 10:52.498
That's what you are.

10:53.908 --> 10:56.181
Common criminal.

10:57.548 --> 11:00.376
You lack the courage to be anything...

11:01.085 --> 11:02.866
Memorable.

11:10.311 --> 11:12.529
Are we done yet?

11:15.506 --> 11:18.006
Here's a guy that's gonna
get away with this shit.

11:18.674 --> 11:21.064
When the guvnors was around...

11:22.017 --> 11:24.322
They would have done you fucking here.

11:27.250 --> 11:29.351
Now they were memorable.

11:30.196 --> 11:32.266
They had everybody's respect.

11:33.542 --> 11:35.410
Something you'll never have.

11:41.700 --> 11:43.411
Yeah boys, you're free to go.

13:32.050 --> 13:35.026
Hello?
- Hey Ange, it's Michelle, can we talk?

13:35.628 --> 13:38.972
Yeah, sorry,
Now is not a good time actually.

13:40.055 --> 13:42.134
Yeah yeah,
tomorrow is better.

13:43.769 --> 13:46.026
Sorry.
Alright, thanks.

13:48.783 --> 13:51.143
Come on babe, you're just standing here

13:55.595 --> 13:56.880
Who was that?

13:56.943 --> 13:58.888
Ugh, it's just some salesman.

13:58.965 --> 14:00.816
They drive me mad.

14:01.475 --> 14:03.585
Do you want a cup?
- Yeah, sure.

14:41.200 --> 14:44.817
Don't you ever, fucking call
this number again.

14:45.404 --> 14:47.013
Do you understand?

15:00.983 --> 15:03.600
Hey Mitch,
you want to see this, mate

15:04.330 --> 15:06.697
Look at this guy.
- Oh, fucking hell.

15:06.888 --> 15:08.224
Straight in.

15:10.612 --> 15:12.949
You'd be outside by now.
You'd be legging it like a geezer.

15:14.493 --> 15:15.673
I would have pissed myself.

15:15.724 --> 15:18.273
I mean, literaly pissed myself.
Actually there on the spot.

15:18.331 --> 15:20.104
He's swinging a fucking chairs.

15:20.633 --> 15:22.793
Man, you've gotta stand strong
when it comes to these things.

15:22.832 --> 15:24.114
What, so you throw something small...

15:24.146 --> 15:26.099
and suddenly he just drops
his chainsaw and surrenders?

15:26.123 --> 15:27.724
Stop talking shit, Paul.

15:27.847 --> 15:28.944
What you reckon in this one?

15:28.968 --> 15:30.843
Would you stand and fight,
or would you leg it?

15:31.643 --> 15:32.721
Shouldn't have got to that.

15:32.749 --> 15:34.421
Should've been stopped
before he got inside.

15:34.456 --> 15:36.080
Yeah, but it's only a small
local pub, aint it?

15:36.111 --> 15:38.373
There aint no security.
Who's gonna stop it?

15:38.428 --> 15:40.538
It's not like he's carrying a knife.

15:40.569 --> 15:43.100
He's had to be walking down the
street with that thing in his hand.

15:43.216 --> 15:44.626
Just traveling down the
road with a chainsaw.

15:44.669 --> 15:47.047
Gotta go to round my nange
and fix shit.

15:47.079 --> 15:49.509
Her chainsaw ran out of battery.

15:50.858 --> 15:53.444
Once you're inside you
gotta work as a unit.

15:55.071 --> 15:56.867
Look at his body position.

15:57.344 --> 15:59.289
He's not in control
of that weapon.

16:00.065 --> 16:01.578
As long as one of
you faces him...

16:01.618 --> 16:03.266
Close enough to get his
attention, but far enough

16:03.305 --> 16:05.530
away to avoid a launch,
then you're in business.

16:06.766 --> 16:08.219
And the other two...

16:09.357 --> 16:11.146
One comes from here.

16:11.300 --> 16:12.862
And one from here.

16:13.265 --> 16:14.749
One attacks from behind.

16:14.814 --> 16:17.117
One goes low.
Simple.

16:24.831 --> 16:26.769
Yeah, saw it in a film somewhere.

16:27.398 --> 16:29.309
Listen, get back to work you boys.

16:29.339 --> 16:30.635
This isn't an olderly camp.

16:30.674 --> 16:32.315
We've got clients to please.

16:32.868 --> 16:34.110
He thinks he's Rambo.

17:23.836 --> 17:26.344
Yeah, give him a beer.
He doesn't have beer over here.

17:26.730 --> 17:29.093
Nah, you know I don't drink beer mate.
I've got subscripts.

17:29.168 --> 17:31.515
It's not about meds,
it's about your misses.

17:36.041 --> 17:37.144
Fuck off.

17:37.199 --> 17:38.808
I'm the guvnor.

17:39.106 --> 17:40.895
What?
The guvnor?

17:40.925 --> 17:41.753
Yeah.

17:41.796 --> 17:44.015
You weren't the fucking
guvnor at City last week.

17:44.233 --> 17:46.694
Hey, take your mind back
to West Ham away.

17:46.726 --> 17:48.391
I saved your fucking life,
as usual.

17:48.431 --> 17:49.955
Ah, fuck you saved my life.

17:49.980 --> 17:52.089
Oi, the guvnor is the boss.

17:52.135 --> 17:54.174
Look at the size of you.

17:56.270 --> 17:57.286
I'll have you.

17:58.788 --> 18:00.452
Is that right?
- Yeah, come here.

18:01.165 --> 18:02.821
- Bing, bing, bing.

18:03.285 --> 18:04.564
You wanna touch me,
or what?

18:10.452 --> 18:12.261
You do that again...

18:13.147 --> 18:14.446
And I'll fill you.

18:14.475 --> 18:16.030
Careful mate, he's our case.

18:17.107 --> 18:19.263
I think the guvnor just
shit himself

18:20.379 --> 18:21.676
- Bye darling.

18:22.288 --> 18:23.312
- Love you.

18:52.544 --> 18:53.970
Have you been talking about me?

18:54.009 --> 18:55.119
- No.

18:55.537 --> 18:58.154
I don't mind,
I quite like it.

19:01.739 --> 19:04.224
Do you reckon I'm a better
than the guvnors?

19:04.292 --> 19:05.831
Uh, I don't care.

19:05.881 --> 19:07.764
Yeah, now, neither do I,
but I heard rumours...

19:07.843 --> 19:10.163
That some oldschool bollocks
now don't like it.

19:10.502 --> 19:12.392
Five, fifty-five, please

19:17.946 --> 19:19.376
Not today.

19:20.404 --> 19:22.896
Now don't believe all the
hairy chest stuff.

19:22.962 --> 19:24.864
It's simple, greens are good
for your football.

19:24.907 --> 19:26.234
Eat these...

19:26.313 --> 19:27.860
And it will make you a better player.

19:27.899 --> 19:29.829
- But I hate 'em.
Just eat it.

19:29.867 --> 19:31.492
- But you don't eat them.
And?

19:33.809 --> 19:34.911
Good boy.

19:35.433 --> 19:37.623
Alright, I gotta pop out
for an hour, or so.

19:37.694 --> 19:39.846
But if these aren't gone by
the time I get back.

19:40.528 --> 19:42.088
No boots.

19:42.528 --> 19:44.747
Oi.
Don't give me that.

19:45.248 --> 19:46.513
You good?

19:46.588 --> 19:48.119
See you in a bit, yeah?

20:00.518 --> 20:02.211
Why are you sweeping?

20:02.258 --> 20:03.649
What did you do at school today?

20:03.674 --> 20:04.883
Not much.

20:06.331 --> 20:07.596
You much have done something.

20:09.251 --> 20:12.368
No mom. Same as yesterday
and the day before.

20:12.808 --> 20:14.564
- Show your mother...

20:14.603 --> 20:16.111
Some fucking respect.

20:22.939 --> 20:24.096
Say sorry.

20:25.660 --> 20:26.684
Sorry.

20:26.713 --> 20:28.931
Mitch, calm down, he's just
being fair to humor.

20:30.786 --> 20:32.341
Jump up and down.

20:34.320 --> 20:36.761
Go on.
Jump up and down.

20:38.112 --> 20:38.714
- Mitch..

20:38.739 --> 20:39.903
Do it!

20:40.941 --> 20:43.121
Stop it.
What the hell is going on?

20:43.548 --> 20:45.469
Do you want to tell her?
Or should I?

20:45.599 --> 20:47.334
Mitch, what's going on?

20:47.916 --> 20:49.080
Come here.

20:49.124 --> 20:50.366
Come here!

20:50.793 --> 20:53.074
Do you want me to spit
in your face aswell, boy?

20:53.099 --> 20:55.060
What the hell is going on?

20:55.094 --> 20:58.945
Dont you ever let me catch you
doing anything like that ever again.

20:59.042 --> 21:01.073
Now go to your room!

21:01.124 --> 21:02.218
Go on!

21:06.838 --> 21:07.869
Mitch..

21:58.063 --> 22:00.820
Where are the guvnors?

22:04.195 --> 22:06.458
May I help you, lads?

22:07.068 --> 22:08.310
Yeah, maybe.

22:10.412 --> 22:11.920
We're looking for a bunch
of old fuckers..

22:11.945 --> 22:14.413
Who like to call
themself the guvnors.

22:17.007 --> 22:18.490
Have you seen them?

22:19.977 --> 22:22.000
No guvnors in here, son.

22:22.857 --> 22:24.029
Only me.

22:24.909 --> 22:26.159
Is that right?

22:28.117 --> 22:29.578
Who are you?

22:30.826 --> 22:32.662
I think you know who I am.

22:34.565 --> 22:35.971
No.
I give up.

22:36.622 --> 22:37.591
Who are you?

22:37.645 --> 22:40.153
I wrecked a man named Strongman,
didn't I?

22:40.187 --> 22:41.843
Not really.

22:42.236 --> 22:44.040
Have you got any ID?

22:44.095 --> 22:46.220
Are you boys all over 18?
Now aren't ya?

22:46.298 --> 22:47.344
Fuck off.

22:47.924 --> 22:49.135
Alright.

22:49.806 --> 22:51.025
Outside.

22:52.841 --> 22:54.146
Fancy it?

22:56.865 --> 22:58.600
No, I'm alright.

22:59.847 --> 23:02.546
Nah, it's just I don't tend
to brawl with the footsoldiers

23:04.985 --> 23:07.344
I want to have a crack at your boss.

23:08.658 --> 23:09.893
Mitch, right?

23:10.166 --> 23:12.081
He left 20 years ago.

23:12.147 --> 23:15.076
He's miles out, and I don't know where.
So...

23:15.776 --> 23:16.913
Good luck with that.

23:16.982 --> 23:20.349
It's pretty much impossible to
lose people these days.

23:20.747 --> 23:22.833
Haven't you heard of the internet?

23:25.555 --> 23:29.153
Fucking hell, ofcourse you haven't.
It's like a time warp in here.

23:31.509 --> 23:33.699
This used to be the most
feared pub in London, and now...

23:33.731 --> 23:35.919
It looks like a badly
decorated job center.

23:37.600 --> 23:39.412
Do yourself a favor.

23:40.280 --> 23:41.389
Get out.

23:43.061 --> 23:45.049
I think I might buy a pint.

23:45.151 --> 23:46.979
Back off, son.

23:47.140 --> 23:49.148
The guvnors are extinct.

23:50.540 --> 23:52.605
But for the record...

23:52.854 --> 23:55.003
If I was still a player.

23:55.512 --> 23:59.207
You're exactly the kind of dealing shit,
I'd string up for fun.

23:59.286 --> 24:00.825
Yeah, is that right?

24:00.875 --> 24:02.234
Yeah.

24:04.338 --> 24:06.885
Well, you know what, grandad?

24:07.666 --> 24:11.371
I'm a little fucked off with the
tone everyone is taking with me in here.

24:13.879 --> 24:15.596
I came down...

24:15.655 --> 24:18.399
To ask some simple questions.

24:18.915 --> 24:22.417
In truth, I came here in peace.

24:22.485 --> 24:24.453
To show my respect.

24:26.039 --> 24:28.445
Leave and it can stay that way.

24:30.587 --> 24:32.525
But if you don't...

24:33.925 --> 24:36.953
I'll be forced to give you a little
hide of myself.

24:38.991 --> 24:40.616
You're joking.

24:41.957 --> 24:44.834
Fucking hell, who's this?
The walking dead?

24:47.483 --> 24:49.866
Your time is long gone,
old man.

24:50.213 --> 24:51.769
Sit down...

24:51.801 --> 24:53.137
And shut up.

24:54.440 --> 24:55.503
Ow!

25:03.603 --> 25:04.908
Ta-da.

25:09.786 --> 25:10.982
One punch.

25:21.639 --> 25:23.623
You made my fucking day, Mick.

25:23.655 --> 25:24.983
What do you want?

25:25.058 --> 25:26.136
- A cup of tea.

25:26.609 --> 25:27.632
Good man.

25:38.303 --> 25:40.241
Oi boss, come and have
a look at this.

25:40.287 --> 25:42.681
Mitch, this old timer knocks
out this little lyric...

25:42.715 --> 25:44.199
It is exceptional.

25:44.231 --> 25:45.777
If you're alright,
I'm busy.

25:45.811 --> 25:48.421
Oh c'mon boss,
have a bust at this.

25:48.775 --> 25:50.455
Email it to me,
I'll watch it later.

25:51.712 --> 25:52.891
Ba-Boom!

25:53.504 --> 25:54.723
Lads!

25:55.645 --> 25:56.723
Thank you.

26:01.477 --> 26:02.501
G'Morning.

26:02.865 --> 26:03.888
G'Afternoon.

26:06.298 --> 26:08.470
The old Mick,
you've only gone viral.

26:08.713 --> 26:09.986
Viral?

26:10.159 --> 26:12.081
Don't worry, there's
no catching.

26:12.654 --> 26:15.669
Half a million people have seen you
online, smacking that twat.

26:15.778 --> 26:16.864
What?

26:17.641 --> 26:18.915
Last night...

26:19.086 --> 26:20.609
CCTV.

26:22.272 --> 26:23.475
Good.

26:23.839 --> 26:25.886
Coming in this pub like that.

26:26.096 --> 26:27.682
They got no idea.

26:28.035 --> 26:29.676
I mean; There's no hierarchy, is there?

26:29.764 --> 26:31.450
I don't want to rain them in,
not like you.

26:31.495 --> 26:33.503
They should put back conscription.

26:34.877 --> 26:36.612
Wouldn't have done us any good.

26:36.683 --> 26:38.293
I mean, we weren't much
better, were we?

26:38.346 --> 26:39.676
Ah well, you weren't criminals...

26:39.714 --> 26:42.167
I just told you how to
defend yourselfs, that's all.

26:42.510 --> 26:44.393
Things got a bit out of hand.

26:48.212 --> 26:50.649
By coming in here...

26:50.753 --> 26:52.386
You'd make a commitment.

26:53.747 --> 26:56.230
A commitment to the people
who sat next to you.

26:57.393 --> 26:59.018
A commitment to me.

26:59.863 --> 27:02.090
You can come in here night and day.

27:02.582 --> 27:04.832
It could be somewhere you
can call home.

27:05.741 --> 27:09.032
A place,
where you learn life.

27:09.890 --> 27:11.554
But I've got 2 rules.

27:12.516 --> 27:13.734
Number 1:

27:14.842 --> 27:16.569
Any trouble outside...

27:16.644 --> 27:18.019
You'll leave at the door.

27:18.117 --> 27:19.797
You come here to train.

27:20.326 --> 27:22.076
Any drama's...

27:22.139 --> 27:23.280
And you're out.

27:24.193 --> 27:25.617
Number 2:

27:26.691 --> 27:28.496
The people sat next to you...

27:29.074 --> 27:30.949
Are now your family.

27:31.778 --> 27:33.114
Your people.

27:33.638 --> 27:34.865
Your blood.

27:36.107 --> 27:37.286
Family...

27:37.364 --> 27:39.732
Is the most important thing.

27:41.757 --> 27:42.632
Welcome.

28:02.014 --> 28:03.278
I don't know why you
picked these ones up.

28:03.315 --> 28:05.235
I've only given you 50 quid.

28:05.283 --> 28:06.759
- But Ronaldo has got these.

28:06.791 --> 28:10.432
Yeah, but when he started out,
he would have killed for these.

28:10.546 --> 28:12.608
I'll do you a deal, yeah?

28:12.748 --> 28:14.866
You score 30 goals in these this season..

28:14.919 --> 28:16.794
And I'll buy these ones
next year, alright?

28:16.852 --> 28:18.610
- What if I score 40?

28:21.770 --> 28:23.504
Okay look, try them on.

28:26.513 --> 28:27.904
Look, they're just like
mile-boots...

28:28.313 --> 28:29.336
Beautiful.

28:29.551 --> 28:30.427
Clean.

28:30.493 --> 28:31.439
Classic.

28:32.102 --> 28:33.266
- Shit.
Oi!

28:34.452 --> 28:36.515
Anymore of that and
you get no boots, alright?

28:39.298 --> 28:40.361
Now, wrap them up.

28:40.392 --> 28:42.941
Take them to the till.
And lets pay for them, alright?

28:44.794 --> 28:45.826
Hey, bro!

28:46.414 --> 28:48.383
Can you get down over here,
real quick?

28:48.436 --> 28:51.655
Yeah, I just have a little question
about one of them T-shirts down here.

28:51.695 --> 28:54.695
- Which one then?
Euh.. It's just..

28:58.804 --> 29:00.578
If I ever see you outside
this shop again...

29:00.628 --> 29:02.995
I swear to fuck,
I'll cut your throat, alright?

29:03.025 --> 29:04.108
- Yeah.

29:04.734 --> 29:06.952
Is there anything more
to be laughing about?

29:07.005 --> 29:08.138
- No, mate.

29:09.696 --> 29:10.815
Good.

29:30.998 --> 29:33.456
You know, I'm not
ashamed of who I am.

29:35.118 --> 29:36.993
I'm not ashamed of who I was.

29:41.258 --> 29:43.282
But I don't want you
to become me.

29:46.469 --> 29:48.408
You are much
better than that.

29:55.434 --> 29:57.113
I thought you weren't
gonna take me to football?

29:57.148 --> 29:59.023
International is a different.

30:00.570 --> 30:02.085
And we're in a box.

30:10.052 --> 30:11.568
Your great-grand father...

30:11.607 --> 30:13.280
Used to take us to
game on a bus.

30:13.321 --> 30:15.228
He used to carry this
silly little duffle bag...

30:15.260 --> 30:17.839
With a pair of boots in it,
in case the team where a man down.

30:18.640 --> 30:20.514
- Yeah, but what about his shin guards?

30:20.594 --> 30:23.383
Who cares about shin guards,
you can kick a ball and save his life.

30:23.410 --> 30:25.996
And who is gonna pick him out of a crowd?
He wasn't Stanley Petrol.

30:26.023 --> 30:26.711
- Who?

30:26.750 --> 30:27.969
Never mind.

30:28.693 --> 30:29.787
- What about you?

30:29.841 --> 30:30.747
- Where you any good?

30:30.794 --> 30:32.794
They used to call me
"The Made Net Maradona".

30:33.037 --> 30:33.561
- Who?

30:33.624 --> 30:34.976
Diego Maradona.

30:35.080 --> 30:35.885
- No clue.

30:37.462 --> 30:38.595
You are joking.

30:38.704 --> 30:39.462
- No.

30:44.983 --> 30:46.425
Nothing matches this.

30:46.540 --> 30:48.365
You can try and find
the excitement elsewhere...

30:48.397 --> 30:49.921
But it just don't exists.

30:50.019 --> 30:52.440
The nerves.
The tension.

30:52.473 --> 30:55.700
For the next 90 minutes,
anything can happen.

30:55.747 --> 30:57.997
I'm sorry it took me so
long to bring you here, my son.

31:02.003 --> 31:03.643
Look at that.

31:06.220 --> 31:07.962
Oi, you there.

31:10.765 --> 31:12.998
I think you're in the wrong
fucking box, mate.

31:26.360 --> 31:27.608
Go inside.

31:27.664 --> 31:28.898
- Dad, it's fine.

31:28.976 --> 31:30.678
Inside.
Now.

31:40.139 --> 31:42.292
Look, I'm not after any
trouble, alright?

31:43.058 --> 31:44.582
I think you're past that.

31:44.777 --> 31:46.004
What's going on here then?

31:46.764 --> 31:48.124
Top boys reunion.

31:48.242 --> 31:50.664
Where would we be if we
didn't have you, champ?

31:50.994 --> 31:52.814
You would have a family, Steve.

31:53.383 --> 31:55.533
Well, there is only so much
of that shit I can handle.

31:59.987 --> 32:00.808
Well...

32:02.787 --> 32:04.599
I'm gonna go and sit with my boy.

32:06.384 --> 32:08.251
I would introduce you,
but, euhh...

32:09.412 --> 32:10.576
What you gonna say?

32:10.690 --> 32:14.100
This is Bads, we used to kick
the fuck out of eachother.

32:14.895 --> 32:16.153
Exactly.

32:32.002 --> 32:33.744
Look after yourselfs.

32:37.528 --> 32:40.129
I'm gonna beat the fuck
out of that old guy.

32:42.218 --> 32:43.289
I don't give a shit.

32:43.700 --> 32:44.864
Chill,
this guys is...

32:44.909 --> 32:47.807
No one fucking disrespects
me like that!

33:00.646 --> 33:02.567
- Bom.
What?

33:04.572 --> 33:06.197
- Boom.
What?!

33:10.951 --> 33:12.241
What is it?

33:14.568 --> 33:16.621
How the fuck...?

33:16.652 --> 33:18.728
I know you wanna
show of the old fellow.

33:18.764 --> 33:21.327
But we got chance with
the other Guvnors here.

33:21.808 --> 33:23.840
I'll send a little message
of to him first.

33:25.530 --> 33:26.991
I'll go.

33:29.021 --> 33:30.279
Alright.

33:31.474 --> 33:32.967
Tomorrow.

33:35.059 --> 33:36.481
Let me get the old man.

33:54.257 --> 33:55.718
Stay there.

33:56.812 --> 33:57.723
Move!

34:00.439 --> 34:02.320
Can I have a word please, mate?

34:03.606 --> 34:05.684
I heard that you were though.

34:08.509 --> 34:10.475
I want to have a little chat.

34:12.195 --> 34:14.031
I'm an old friend
of your dad.

34:15.494 --> 34:16.884
I want you to tell him...

34:16.925 --> 34:18.933
I'm going after the old man...

34:19.538 --> 34:21.757
And then tell him I'm
coming after him.

34:22.667 --> 34:24.503
Tell him I know where you live.

34:26.190 --> 34:28.150
Now open your fucking mouth.

34:31.466 --> 34:32.356
- No.

34:33.179 --> 34:34.077
No.

34:46.880 --> 34:48.052
Show him that.

34:55.005 --> 34:57.059
Hey, here he is.

34:57.123 --> 34:58.078
Come here.

34:59.280 --> 35:01.100
I wanted to do
that for years.

35:01.564 --> 35:03.009
I never knew you
felt that way.

35:03.051 --> 35:04.653
Not the kisses,
the punch.

35:04.702 --> 35:06.261
That little shit
had it coming.

35:06.324 --> 35:07.371
Right, I know.

35:07.425 --> 35:08.738
What are you having?

35:08.790 --> 35:10.659
Alright, chips for me...

35:10.698 --> 35:12.245
Better sausage for Nil.

35:12.301 --> 35:14.318
No, just give us a normal sausage...

35:14.378 --> 35:16.296
You just make it a better one for me.

35:16.367 --> 35:18.445
You got that, sis?
- Got it.

35:30.798 --> 35:32.009
Apparantly...

35:32.076 --> 35:35.006
We can have those tickets for
every England friendly.

35:53.236 --> 35:54.525
Are you alright?

35:55.668 --> 35:57.371
The kid that did this
wanted you.

36:02.501 --> 36:04.446
The kid came to my
school and said...

36:05.497 --> 36:07.395
I should tell you that he'd
batter the old man.

36:10.122 --> 36:11.427
And you're next.

36:22.617 --> 36:25.776
 I'll ask around and find out
what this is about okay? Just eh...

36:27.902 --> 36:29.520
Please don't tell your mother.

40:00.429 --> 40:02.014
Mickey!

40:06.489 --> 40:07.512
Mick!

40:09.741 --> 40:11.085
C'mon you lazy old sob.

40:11.124 --> 40:12.733
Breakfast won't make itself.

40:22.063 --> 40:24.108
Oh no, Mickey.
Mickey!

41:00.384 --> 41:01.735
You fucking!

41:04.676 --> 41:05.738
It's alright...

41:05.785 --> 41:06.691
It's alright.

41:30.013 --> 41:31.100
Hello?

41:32.194 --> 41:33.640
No, not at the moment.

41:34.615 --> 41:36.271
No, I'll speak to
you later.

41:36.404 --> 41:37.287
Okay.

41:41.326 --> 41:42.654
Is someone harassing you?

41:42.704 --> 41:43.595
No, no.

41:43.643 --> 41:44.463
It's fine.

41:46.298 --> 41:47.345
Come on.

41:47.838 --> 41:48.845
- But mom...
Out.

41:52.678 --> 41:53.780
I love you.

42:39.427 --> 42:41.356
What did I tell you
about calling this...

42:41.688 --> 42:42.572
Yeah...

43:13.153 --> 43:15.304
We're all here today
to remember Mickey...

43:19.308 --> 43:20.480
One of the best.

43:21.600 --> 43:23.717
Mick told me to mean it
if he's named Mush.

43:24.969 --> 43:26.555
He said: Mush people...

43:27.235 --> 43:29.383
I thought it was from blacksmith.

43:29.679 --> 43:30.804
You know...

43:31.449 --> 43:34.168
A man who works with iron and steel.

43:34.384 --> 43:36.673
And not a bad description
of his left and right, eh?

43:39.597 --> 43:42.066
But it's a.. It's an older word.

43:44.017 --> 43:45.298
German word.

43:47.951 --> 43:49.240
Schmitten

43:51.464 --> 43:52.370
It means...

43:52.402 --> 43:53.449
Soldier.

43:58.357 --> 44:00.044
That was the Mickey I knew.

44:02.386 --> 44:04.230
Mick was always there for me.

44:05.234 --> 44:06.734
For all of us.

44:08.321 --> 44:10.551
He gave us a place to call home.

44:14.884 --> 44:16.775
He thaught me
everthing I know.

44:18.888 --> 44:20.255
And now he's gone.

44:29.780 --> 44:31.100
Loved his quote's, Mick.

44:32.275 --> 44:33.385
So...

44:34.479 --> 44:35.566
Here...

44:35.634 --> 44:37.298
Here's one for the ferryman.

44:37.610 --> 44:39.517
It's Mark Twain.
Yeah?

44:42.637 --> 44:45.059
The fear of death...

44:45.160 --> 44:47.254
Follows from the fear of life.

44:48.642 --> 44:50.705
The man who has lived fully...

44:51.563 --> 44:54.567
Is prepared to die at any time.

44:56.219 --> 44:58.704
To Mickey.
- To Mickey!

45:01.344 --> 45:02.493
Cheers.

45:02.951 --> 45:03.872
Michelle...

45:03.998 --> 45:05.155
Are you eh?...

45:05.226 --> 45:07.896
Just keep an eye on
eh.. you, alright? Okay.

45:27.698 --> 45:29.558
How did you let this happen?

45:32.755 --> 45:33.935
Excuse me?

45:35.188 --> 45:36.259
Who's the kid?

45:36.975 --> 45:38.830
No, not today.

45:39.526 --> 45:40.706
Not now.

45:42.035 --> 45:43.238
Who is he?

45:44.556 --> 45:46.657
20 years...
No explanation...

45:46.681 --> 45:48.956
No apology...

45:48.983 --> 45:49.920
No nothing.

45:50.768 --> 45:52.874
I ain't come here for
your foregiveness.

45:56.348 --> 45:59.129
I couldn't give a shit what you
or anyone else thinks of me.

45:59.197 --> 46:00.339
I know that.

46:00.512 --> 46:03.214
Don't know that you
want the same thing as me.

46:06.333 --> 46:08.364
So don't fight me on this.

46:10.336 --> 46:11.898
Do this with me.

46:14.261 --> 46:15.230
Well?

46:17.122 --> 46:18.687
Adam Shanko.

46:21.363 --> 46:23.851
He's the wanker Mickey
slapped on the video.

46:31.936 --> 46:33.424
What's his story?

46:34.467 --> 46:35.717
He's a prick.

46:38.795 --> 46:40.593
Why did Mickey get involved?

46:43.846 --> 46:45.577
The kid came in the pub...

46:45.729 --> 46:46.963
Looking for you.

46:49.564 --> 46:51.936
That's another body
on your list.

46:54.198 --> 46:56.339
You do remember Charlie?

47:08.892 --> 47:11.509
Where are the others?
Why aren't they here?

47:12.389 --> 47:14.547
Because I told them
not to come.

47:15.623 --> 47:17.130
Mickey wouldn't have...

47:17.491 --> 47:19.257
He wouldn't want it to fuzz.

47:20.864 --> 47:22.608
Well, we're gonna need them.

47:22.964 --> 47:24.151
For what?

47:31.289 --> 47:32.956
Pull yourself together.

47:34.002 --> 47:36.596
And take me to the boys.

47:37.943 --> 47:39.365
Alright.

47:41.208 --> 47:42.552
For Mickey.

47:45.440 --> 47:46.995
But they aint gonna like you.

47:49.169 --> 47:51.150
No one around here
respects you anymore.

47:52.616 --> 47:54.455
Not since you walked.

48:08.834 --> 48:10.339
Stay here,
I'll be back.

49:48.915 --> 49:50.076
Fat boy!

49:51.632 --> 49:52.765
Hello son.

49:53.994 --> 49:55.360
How you doing?

49:55.814 --> 49:57.181
Nice to see you.

49:58.983 --> 50:00.808
How you feeling?
Feeling alright?

50:07.392 --> 50:11.202
Just tell us Adam Shanko
put you up to this.

50:11.666 --> 50:12.731
Cause we know.

50:13.517 --> 50:15.470
And this would be all over.

50:16.577 --> 50:17.632
When you get older.

50:17.668 --> 50:20.133
People are always gonna describe
things to you by saying...

50:20.609 --> 50:22.195
It's just like riding a bike.

50:22.220 --> 50:23.642
So you got to learn.

50:33.245 --> 50:34.691
They got Jade.

50:36.169 --> 50:37.333
Yeah, don't worry.

50:37.369 --> 50:39.054
He's good.
He won't talk.

50:40.009 --> 50:41.730
Well, he better fucking not.

50:43.940 --> 50:45.214
I got this,
I got this.

50:45.971 --> 50:47.094
Jade...

50:47.417 --> 50:49.095
This isn't a joke.

50:49.275 --> 50:51.209
This is fucking real life.

50:54.637 --> 50:55.972
Jade...

50:58.182 --> 50:59.330
Jade...

51:02.430 --> 51:03.802
It's a girls name.

51:04.645 --> 51:07.518
You'll be the biggest sissy
bitch on the wing.

51:07.816 --> 51:09.300
What was your mother thinking?

51:09.993 --> 51:11.172
Oi!

51:12.500 --> 51:14.612
You promised you'd look after him.
- Yeah I will.

51:14.650 --> 51:16.150
Well it doesn't look like it to me.

51:16.201 --> 51:17.412
- It will only be a couple of..

51:17.476 --> 51:18.289
Na na na.

51:18.337 --> 51:21.126
My boy doing time is
not an option, yeah?

51:21.156 --> 51:23.063
You don't tell a mother you're
going to look after her child...

51:23.098 --> 51:25.027
And then speak:
It's only gonna be a bit of bird.

51:25.052 --> 51:26.315
Yeah, but there's
nothing I can do.

51:26.376 --> 51:27.688
Yes, there is.

51:28.277 --> 51:29.699
No, there's not!

51:29.748 --> 51:31.639
I've kept his nose clean for years now.

51:31.698 --> 51:33.784
He'll be out in no time.

51:33.824 --> 51:36.417
Oh, so while he's rotting in there,
you're on road yeah?

51:36.453 --> 51:37.320
Listen...

51:37.367 --> 51:39.851
I know where ever he was
that night, you where too.

51:41.070 --> 51:42.086
Listen...

51:43.261 --> 51:44.902
Don't make me call this geezer, yeah?

51:44.941 --> 51:47.292
I'm telling you now,
don't make me call him.

51:47.978 --> 51:49.556
Yeah, I'm being serious.

51:49.581 --> 51:51.659
You'd better sort this out,
I want my child back.

52:06.213 --> 52:08.189
I don't know why I have to go.

52:08.223 --> 52:10.051
But they say they want me there.

52:14.852 --> 52:16.305
I went to the wake.

52:16.795 --> 52:18.685
I've made my peace,
that's it.

52:20.590 --> 52:22.305
Listen, we need to talk.

52:22.750 --> 52:25.048
Could you come around
my way and meet me?

52:25.180 --> 52:27.861
I'm going away on business.
With Mike.

52:29.550 --> 52:31.745
Yeah, I'm a bit worried
about something.

52:32.422 --> 52:34.356
Why would I risk all this?

52:35.881 --> 52:37.287
I'll see you then.

52:41.153 --> 52:43.364
I just think he might
be planning something.

52:44.014 --> 52:45.319
Yeah, well...

52:45.448 --> 52:48.347
He won't be showing his face
around of red guards, would he?

52:48.473 --> 52:50.208
Don't be so sure.

52:51.060 --> 52:52.592
I'll run some checks.

52:53.981 --> 52:55.731
I can't lose him now.

52:56.456 --> 52:58.503
Not after everything
we've been through.

53:02.318 --> 53:03.927
You've come a long way.

53:03.959 --> 53:05.116
Yeah.

53:05.861 --> 53:07.720
And I'm not going back.

53:10.013 --> 53:11.332
You can't do that.

53:11.371 --> 53:13.012
Ofcourse I can.

53:13.619 --> 53:15.682
Check out the Plaza
down on Oxford Street.

53:15.748 --> 53:17.030
Walk through to the main bit...

53:17.075 --> 53:18.769
And look directly up.

53:19.598 --> 53:21.692
It's an enormous pussy.

53:21.719 --> 53:23.876
Staring straight at you.

53:24.016 --> 53:25.739
A message from God.

53:26.762 --> 53:28.806
Come here, let me show you something.

53:29.047 --> 53:31.901
I'm gonna put some pussies
on either side. Yeah?

53:32.077 --> 53:33.718
Like Brazilian foliage.

53:33.782 --> 53:34.865
Nice and tidy, yeah?

53:34.904 --> 53:37.151
Nice and tidy,
that's the one.

53:37.214 --> 53:38.300
Bill?

53:44.132 --> 53:45.953
Fuck.
Me.

53:46.393 --> 53:47.494
Come here.

53:49.571 --> 53:50.672
Are you alright, mate?

53:51.526 --> 53:52.768
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good.

53:52.814 --> 53:54.149
You're looking stoosh.

53:59.659 --> 54:02.395
What the fuck do you
bring him here for?

54:10.328 --> 54:11.703
I like the idea.

54:12.142 --> 54:14.431
I want to smash a couple
of those for a while now.

54:15.174 --> 54:16.250
But not with you.

54:16.322 --> 54:17.775
Are you fucking mad?

54:17.838 --> 54:18.939
Ah c'mon, Bill.

54:18.964 --> 54:20.941
We're stronger with you in it.

54:21.685 --> 54:23.202
Always were.

54:24.683 --> 54:26.573
Alright, get in the cage
with my boy.

54:26.875 --> 54:28.726
Let's see if your arshole
is still intact.

54:31.459 --> 54:33.779
You fucked of to the city
and left him for dead, so...

54:34.207 --> 54:35.762
This is where we are.

54:35.870 --> 54:37.120
All this trouble now,
we don't need him.

54:37.170 --> 54:38.233
No, no, no...

54:38.275 --> 54:39.619
We can do this.

54:39.857 --> 54:41.513
And he fucking laughs around.

54:42.860 --> 54:43.851
True.

54:45.449 --> 54:46.474
Oi!

55:03.856 --> 55:04.866
Mitch!

55:05.585 --> 55:06.491
Mitch!

55:07.983 --> 55:08.804
Come here.

55:10.269 --> 55:11.284
How are you?

55:11.824 --> 55:12.824
I'm alright.

55:33.997 --> 55:35.169
Can we go now?

55:36.970 --> 55:39.384
What are you gonna do
about the fucking ticket?

55:42.275 --> 55:43.408
What you're gonna do...

55:43.433 --> 55:45.905
Is you are gonna go on,
call the number on your ticket...

55:45.940 --> 55:48.599
And you're gonna pay it
like a good boy, within 14 days...

55:48.636 --> 55:50.082
Or it will double.

55:50.107 --> 55:52.037
Next time you
park around here...

55:52.067 --> 55:53.770
Read the fucking signs.

55:53.808 --> 55:57.736
Open your mouth,
you lacking fucking prick.

56:00.506 --> 56:01.647
Clownshoes.

56:02.582 --> 56:03.683
Fancy a pint?

56:17.276 --> 56:19.346
I was thinking about
going to Spain.

56:20.370 --> 56:22.419
I've never been out of England before.

56:22.583 --> 56:24.583
No, honoust, I've never done it.

56:24.876 --> 56:27.468
Don't expect the beach,
we're gonna head for the hills.

56:27.666 --> 56:29.330
Yeah, I'm up for that.

56:29.493 --> 56:31.009
I'll make some calls.

56:31.143 --> 56:32.962
What about your little brother?

56:33.594 --> 56:34.938
Don't worry about him.

56:35.020 --> 56:36.442
We're going.

56:39.040 --> 56:40.566
Have you got any roads?

56:42.911 --> 56:43.989
Yeah.

56:47.123 --> 56:49.020
I was thinking, yeah,
if we do go to Spain...

56:49.069 --> 56:50.780
Do you reckon we could
go to the new Cup?

56:52.472 --> 56:53.823
I've heard about it.

57:01.082 --> 57:02.277
Yeah, mate.

57:05.533 --> 57:07.109
Yeah, we'll go both.

57:08.909 --> 57:10.505
Yeah, do something with that.

57:12.233 --> 57:13.825
I said: Do something with that.

57:16.324 --> 57:19.121
I just remember I would
pick up my brother.

57:19.198 --> 57:20.776
See you in a bit.

57:32.171 --> 57:34.632
Oi, oi!
That's a 50 pound fine in here.

57:34.679 --> 57:35.655
What?

57:51.801 --> 57:52.894
Now listen...

57:52.942 --> 57:54.786
Enjoy these,
these are smuggled...

57:54.811 --> 57:56.832
All the way over from Cuba.

57:56.876 --> 57:58.947
From my midget pal...

57:58.972 --> 57:59.853
Guan.

57:59.878 --> 58:02.487
Smuggled them.
Up his arse.

58:03.304 --> 58:05.108
They taste like it, mate.

58:05.910 --> 58:07.105
Yeah, well.

58:07.186 --> 58:08.413
It's a long flight.

58:13.971 --> 58:15.314
Let's go down there...

58:15.345 --> 58:16.666
And knock them all out.

58:17.390 --> 58:18.460
No.

58:18.507 --> 58:20.195
Not this lad,
I mean they got teeth.

58:20.224 --> 58:22.224
Seriously.
They're not silly.

58:22.290 --> 58:24.184
Alright, we gotta trade careful.

58:24.683 --> 58:26.285
I mean, there are only
a few that count.

58:26.355 --> 58:27.504
If we got the head off...

58:27.529 --> 58:29.818
The rest would scatter.
Guaranteed.

58:30.234 --> 58:32.632
As long as we are straight,
I don't give a fuck about the other lot.

58:32.703 --> 58:34.565
I'm straight.
You?

58:42.696 --> 58:44.439
You know what this means.

58:45.381 --> 58:46.562
Fuck that.

58:46.612 --> 58:48.403
Don't be soft Mitch,
come on!

58:48.448 --> 58:50.706
Trust me, you do not
want me at play.

58:51.161 --> 58:52.630
Right, boy.

58:52.707 --> 58:54.370
It's not everyday that
you win one of these.

58:54.417 --> 58:55.493
We're gonna celebrate.

58:55.584 --> 58:56.732
With a drinking game.

58:57.669 --> 58:59.098
I'll put a song on.

58:59.140 --> 59:01.023
And everytime he says 'house'...

59:01.075 --> 59:02.419
You lot, will take a drink.

59:02.984 --> 59:04.656
Everytime he says 'street'...

59:05.018 --> 59:06.534
You lot drink.

59:07.048 --> 59:08.220
Barman!

59:08.804 --> 59:10.054
Do a shot now.
- Sure.

01:00:14.767 --> 01:00:16.957
Are you having a
reunion without me?

01:00:17.472 --> 01:00:19.167
Did I miss your email?

01:00:20.754 --> 01:00:22.545
Or is it 'cause I'm a copper?

01:00:24.477 --> 01:00:26.680
Mitch.
A word with you, please.

01:00:39.585 --> 01:00:41.593
Yeah, 6 pm tomorrow.

01:00:41.640 --> 01:00:43.164
Railerstreet.

01:00:44.891 --> 01:00:46.813
Yeah, he is dealing with this one.

01:00:49.381 --> 01:00:51.436
Cause I got shit with my brother.

01:00:54.355 --> 01:00:55.956
Let's get it done, yeah?

01:00:58.999 --> 01:00:59.999
Cool.

01:01:51.206 --> 01:01:51.979
Who?

01:01:52.004 --> 01:01:54.213
It's just a little pick me up.

01:01:55.363 --> 01:01:56.707
Turn around.

01:02:08.462 --> 01:02:09.781
Hello mate.

01:02:12.375 --> 01:02:14.172
You're about to get fucked.

01:02:17.178 --> 01:02:18.131
What the..?!

01:02:28.114 --> 01:02:29.434
Oops.

01:02:33.809 --> 01:02:35.106
What couldn't wait?

01:02:38.081 --> 01:02:40.018
They knicked his righthand
man last night.

01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:44.113
About time he did something.

01:02:45.295 --> 01:02:47.037
We should make a move.
- Yeah.

01:02:48.614 --> 01:02:49.903
Where are the others?

01:02:49.936 --> 01:02:51.975
I don't know, I was
waiting for you.

01:02:53.517 --> 01:02:55.548
He's gonna be out and
about soon, so...

01:02:58.345 --> 01:02:59.777
Let's do it tonight.

01:03:00.511 --> 01:03:01.519
Lovely.

01:03:01.898 --> 01:03:04.651
So how do you think we knew
you were going to be there?

01:03:09.350 --> 01:03:12.582
It's your job,
well done, boys.

01:03:14.003 --> 01:03:15.223
Yeah, yeah.

01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:16.938
But we're aren't sharp, are we?

01:03:17.756 --> 01:03:18.607
Yeah...

01:03:18.779 --> 01:03:20.373
We've must have had some help.

01:03:21.905 --> 01:03:24.702
But who would want to help us?

01:03:24.843 --> 01:03:26.355
Someone sold you out.

01:03:28.293 --> 01:03:30.793
Your chart sheet is a joke, brother.

01:03:31.902 --> 01:03:33.387
But, on the bright side...

01:03:33.753 --> 01:03:36.042
We get to keep you here,
as long as we want.

01:03:37.033 --> 01:03:39.048
Unless you give us Adam Shanko.

01:03:40.240 --> 01:03:41.537
Well, think about it.

01:03:41.565 --> 01:03:43.073
He goes inside...

01:03:43.914 --> 01:03:45.195
You move up.

01:03:45.352 --> 01:03:47.266
Can't give him up.

01:03:47.994 --> 01:03:50.111
You might be just saving his life.

01:03:51.135 --> 01:03:53.201
I hear...

01:03:54.375 --> 01:03:57.207
There's a few of the old
faces back on the street.

01:03:59.447 --> 01:04:00.361
That's it.

01:04:00.407 --> 01:04:03.751
Bottom left pan corner.
Red door.

01:04:06.737 --> 01:04:08.729
That one there?

01:04:09.850 --> 01:04:11.170
Yeah.

01:04:11.954 --> 01:04:13.610
He lives in his moms old house.

01:04:26.490 --> 01:04:27.763
We're not going in.

01:04:28.695 --> 01:04:30.297
I'm going on my own.
- No...

01:04:30.323 --> 01:04:32.135
You fucking brought us here...

01:04:33.282 --> 01:04:34.884
We'll go in together.

01:04:35.219 --> 01:04:37.515
What the fucking hell
are you doing here?

01:04:37.633 --> 01:04:38.985
You left your chain in my home...

01:04:39.021 --> 01:04:40.420
I wanted to give it back.

01:04:41.815 --> 01:04:42.870
Keep it.

01:04:43.051 --> 01:04:45.848
And you stay the fuck
away from me.

01:04:47.589 --> 01:04:49.401
Sports all over this gaff.

01:04:49.706 --> 01:04:51.451
Don't worry about them,
I clocked them already.

01:04:51.482 --> 01:04:52.428
I'll deal with them.

01:04:52.466 --> 01:04:54.606
Look you lot leaving,
now back off.

01:04:56.342 --> 01:04:57.663
I'll go alone...

01:04:57.715 --> 01:04:59.964
And sort it out for another time.
Alright?

01:05:00.233 --> 01:05:01.827
- No.
I'll go.

01:05:01.857 --> 01:05:03.545
You're not the fucking
guvnor here.

01:05:04.083 --> 01:05:06.475
Is this what's it all
about with you, Trent?

01:05:07.248 --> 01:05:08.631
I thought this was
about Mickey?

01:05:08.670 --> 01:05:10.948
You two, I can't have this here,
not now, alright?

01:05:11.508 --> 01:05:13.508
Now fuck off,
I'll see you later.

01:05:17.010 --> 01:05:18.401
Look, just...

01:05:18.810 --> 01:05:20.193
I'll see you later, alright?

01:05:20.441 --> 01:05:21.738
- I'm pregnant.

01:05:23.916 --> 01:05:24.815
What?

01:05:25.026 --> 01:05:27.668
Don't look at me like that.
We both know it's yours.

01:05:28.370 --> 01:05:31.058
So, if you're still here tomorrow...

01:05:31.104 --> 01:05:32.627
I'm gonna tell her.

01:05:53.783 --> 01:05:55.159
Against the wall.

01:06:27.648 --> 01:06:28.991
We need to talk.

01:06:31.619 --> 01:06:34.159
I heard you're a man of
actions, not words.

01:06:35.658 --> 01:06:37.244
Gun and blade.

01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:40.956
Well, it looks like you got 1 gun.

01:06:41.523 --> 01:06:42.586
Blade.

01:07:05.550 --> 01:07:06.949
Sit the fuck down.

01:07:20.390 --> 01:07:21.867
Do you mind if I smoke?

01:07:21.945 --> 01:07:22.882
Yeah.

01:07:23.403 --> 01:07:24.536
I do.

01:07:27.410 --> 01:07:29.543
I'm glad I got away from all this.

01:07:32.675 --> 01:07:33.815
I pitty you.

01:07:34.554 --> 01:07:36.484
Can you put that sigaret out, please?

01:07:44.027 --> 01:07:46.878
You don't even think about
the future, do you?

01:07:48.615 --> 01:07:50.717
What happends when you're my age.

01:07:53.199 --> 01:07:55.065
I'm hopeful thinking
you'll never get there.

01:07:55.107 --> 01:07:56.350
Trust me.

01:07:56.968 --> 01:07:58.593
I don't wanna get there.

01:08:01.061 --> 01:08:02.718
You want my rep, right?

01:08:17.587 --> 01:08:18.901
Then shoot me.

01:08:27.872 --> 01:08:29.247
But know this...

01:08:31.343 --> 01:08:33.850
Everyone around these flats
knows where I am.

01:08:35.372 --> 01:08:37.928
You kill me here without
facing me on the street...

01:08:38.689 --> 01:08:40.868
And you'll be known for what you are...

01:08:41.993 --> 01:08:43.109
Scum.

01:08:44.219 --> 01:08:46.063
But you'll be dead.

01:08:48.935 --> 01:08:50.131
And me?

01:08:55.551 --> 01:08:57.504
I then killed a legend.

01:09:01.160 --> 01:09:03.363
That will be 2 in a week.

01:09:06.013 --> 01:09:07.435
Fuck it.

01:09:08.843 --> 01:09:11.265
Any last requests,
grandad?

01:09:20.781 --> 01:09:23.265
Why the fuck are you
looking at me like?

01:09:26.327 --> 01:09:27.725
That necklace.

01:09:31.274 --> 01:09:32.921
It's a chain.

01:09:35.432 --> 01:09:38.861
My mother bought it for me
from Malaysia, for my 18th.

01:09:41.957 --> 01:09:43.836
You thought it was bullocks, isn't it?

01:09:45.166 --> 01:09:46.276
Me and Stephen...

01:09:46.301 --> 01:09:47.546
No fucking way.

01:09:48.210 --> 01:09:49.345
She's your mom.

01:09:49.377 --> 01:09:51.042
Don't fucking talk to me.

01:09:51.493 --> 01:09:53.104
I got my family.

01:09:53.424 --> 01:09:54.628
You're pointing that gun at it.

01:09:54.695 --> 01:09:56.992
Get the fuck out of my house.

01:09:57.158 --> 01:09:59.087
Put the gun down.
It's okay.

01:09:59.137 --> 01:10:00.996
She fucking screwed you.

01:10:03.164 --> 01:10:05.023
Then pull the trigger.

01:10:07.687 --> 01:10:08.960
Do it!

01:10:09.767 --> 01:10:10.868
Go on.

01:10:12.861 --> 01:10:13.915
I'll let you live.

01:10:13.940 --> 01:10:17.002
I really don't fucking wanna
know why I shouldn't.

01:10:20.566 --> 01:10:21.824
Start again.

01:10:23.018 --> 01:10:24.158
Like I did.

01:10:24.196 --> 01:10:25.342
We don't all run away.

01:10:25.367 --> 01:10:26.636
You should.

01:10:28.678 --> 01:10:30.037
You got untill tomorrow.

01:10:31.444 --> 01:10:33.964
You don't tell me what to do, yeah?

01:10:35.710 --> 01:10:38.307
I can't sleep,
I had a bad dream.

01:10:42.047 --> 01:10:44.490
Look, just go to next
door for me, yeah?

01:10:44.528 --> 01:10:46.716
I'll come to you just
in a bit, alright?

01:10:47.898 --> 01:10:48.971
I love you bro.

01:10:49.014 --> 01:10:50.296
- Love you too.

01:10:57.576 --> 01:10:59.349
Don't be a fucking prick.

01:11:00.324 --> 01:11:01.465
Don't.

01:11:02.693 --> 01:11:04.078
I got lucky.

01:11:05.008 --> 01:11:06.932
I got a second chance.

01:11:09.351 --> 01:11:11.929
Don't be stupid and
pass this one up, kid.

01:11:14.507 --> 01:11:17.164
You're my birth and 
I will let you live.

01:11:18.136 --> 01:11:19.824
But if you're here tomorrow...

01:11:20.368 --> 01:11:21.970
Yeah then what?

01:11:22.789 --> 01:11:24.633
Then I'll fucking kill you.

01:11:43.332 --> 01:11:46.883
Mitch Raymond use to run 
a firm called The Guvnors.

01:11:48.756 --> 01:11:49.545
Yeah.

01:11:50.446 --> 01:11:51.657
You know them well.

01:11:55.194 --> 01:11:56.858
Too fucking well.

01:11:57.910 --> 01:12:00.539
You'll probably purview your
mates on a drip.

01:12:00.595 --> 01:12:02.736
It would definitely do Shanko.

01:12:03.572 --> 01:12:07.293
Unless you give me,
what I want.

01:12:07.515 --> 01:12:14.519
I am gonna start playing and
watch your fucking family burn.

01:12:14.598 --> 01:12:18.529
I will make sure not a single copper 
from this station steps in to help.

01:12:18.581 --> 01:12:21.116
I will take him around your 
fucking house.

01:12:21.170 --> 01:12:24.543
I would introduce him to
your fucking family.

01:12:32.855 --> 01:12:34.105
Nah.

01:12:34.648 --> 01:12:36.637
I won't give you Shanko.

01:12:40.440 --> 01:12:41.526
I don't want Shanko.

01:12:41.558 --> 01:12:43.467
What the fuck do you want then?

01:12:44.350 --> 01:12:46.326
I want the gun.

01:12:47.063 --> 01:12:48.633
How's that gonna help?

01:12:48.959 --> 01:12:50.693
It's gonna make me look good.

01:12:50.740 --> 01:12:51.599
Impossible.

01:12:53.818 --> 01:12:57.148
When I've got it, 
it won't be used.

01:13:00.820 --> 01:13:02.930
There is no gun.

01:13:03.324 --> 01:13:05.042
We don't have one.

01:13:05.130 --> 01:13:07.208
You little fucking pig.

01:13:15.632 --> 01:13:17.538
Outside.
- Nah leave it, Bill.

01:13:17.563 --> 01:13:19.959
What the fuck are you 
always defending him for?

01:13:19.985 --> 01:13:22.314
He fucking mocked us
off our on turf.

01:13:22.339 --> 01:13:24.261
It's a bit more complicated then that.

01:13:24.312 --> 01:13:26.601
Nah, nah, it's very uncomplicated.

01:13:26.629 --> 01:13:28.277
He walks out on us.

01:13:28.302 --> 01:13:29.782
He cost Charly his life.

01:13:29.807 --> 01:13:31.281
I shouldn't have let it go.

01:13:31.306 --> 01:13:32.363
But I did.

01:13:32.388 --> 01:13:36.484
And now he wants to come and
disrespect us, on our own manner.

01:13:36.611 --> 01:13:38.158
And I'm thinking...

01:13:38.790 --> 01:13:40.884
I'm having none of that.

01:13:55.324 --> 01:13:57.011
He's my son.

01:13:57.892 --> 01:13:59.166
The kid.

01:13:59.986 --> 01:14:01.689
I've just found out.

01:14:04.895 --> 01:14:07.317
I'm probably gonna have
to batter this lad tomorrow.

01:14:08.575 --> 01:14:12.075
It's not ideal, but I don't
a fucking choise.

01:14:16.398 --> 01:14:18.405
I was thinking that 
the few of us...

01:14:18.445 --> 01:14:21.227
Sit down and have a 
quiet drink together.

01:14:35.896 --> 01:14:38.180
I feel like a donkeys arshole.

01:14:41.616 --> 01:14:43.030
See you...

01:14:43.191 --> 01:14:44.715
You're a right shit stirrer.

01:14:44.747 --> 01:14:46.942
All afternoon he's have
me go on about you.

01:14:46.967 --> 01:14:48.734
All fucking afternoon.

01:14:48.759 --> 01:14:49.758
You were lucky...

01:14:49.783 --> 01:14:50.885
Cause if I would've pinged you...

01:14:50.926 --> 01:14:54.117
You would've gone over like
an old granny of a sheet of ice.

01:14:54.505 --> 01:14:55.987
I'll drink to that.

01:14:58.072 --> 01:14:59.119
Cheers.

01:15:56.523 --> 01:15:58.195
I got set up.

01:16:01.697 --> 01:16:04.330
Which means one 
of you fuckers...

01:16:04.377 --> 01:16:05.760
Is a grass.

01:16:16.821 --> 01:16:18.594
Someone needs to talk.

01:16:20.217 --> 01:16:21.623
See this boys...

01:16:24.860 --> 01:16:26.391
This is all I've got.

01:16:30.211 --> 01:16:32.102
I ain't got no family.

01:16:33.277 --> 01:16:34.934
I ain't got no mom.

01:16:35.512 --> 01:16:37.707
I ain't got no fucking dad.

01:16:38.788 --> 01:16:40.397
You boys...

01:16:42.001 --> 01:16:43.933
You boys is all I've got.

01:16:47.622 --> 01:16:50.208
So when someone breaks my trust.

01:16:52.173 --> 01:16:53.798
It fucking hurts, you know?

01:16:58.390 --> 01:17:00.711
Woods, step forward.

01:17:03.722 --> 01:17:05.105
Talk to me, Woods.

01:17:06.823 --> 01:17:07.971
Ain't no grass here.

01:17:07.996 --> 01:17:09.043
Is that right?

01:17:09.473 --> 01:17:11.855
Yeah, not here.

01:17:15.588 --> 01:17:17.643
You need to find one, Woods.

01:17:21.640 --> 01:17:22.945
Today...

01:17:24.222 --> 01:17:25.425
Woods...

01:17:25.910 --> 01:17:27.465
Is being promoted.

01:17:29.088 --> 01:17:31.619
With Trey inside, I need a
new guy, and Woods...

01:17:32.545 --> 01:17:34.295
You're my new guy.

01:17:36.291 --> 01:17:37.861
Your first assignment...

01:17:38.797 --> 01:17:41.559
Is to cut one of these 
fuckers for being a grass.

01:17:42.135 --> 01:17:43.820
I don't care who it is...

01:17:44.638 --> 01:17:46.404
Someone gets cut.

01:17:47.410 --> 01:17:49.035
Now!

01:18:00.145 --> 01:18:01.200
Hold him.

01:18:01.270 --> 01:18:02.122
I said nothing.

01:18:02.161 --> 01:18:02.731
Hold him!

01:18:02.780 --> 01:18:03.936
I said nothing!

01:18:09.740 --> 01:18:11.107
Tomorrow...

01:18:12.519 --> 01:18:14.293
We go into war.

01:18:17.688 --> 01:18:19.414
There's gonna be loads of them.

01:18:21.729 --> 01:18:23.177
That's what I need you to do...

01:18:23.202 --> 01:18:26.221
Is round up every little
fucking rat on this estate

01:18:27.156 --> 01:18:29.031
To come fight, alright?

01:18:34.130 --> 01:18:35.474
Be ready.

01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:56.763
Where's Mitch?

01:18:58.704 --> 01:19:00.376
I think he's lost his head.

01:19:00.615 --> 01:19:02.685
He was saying some weird
shit in the pub last night.

01:19:02.745 --> 01:19:05.683
Some bird came in and
he just left in a hurry.

01:19:05.719 --> 01:19:06.649
What do you mean?

01:19:06.674 --> 01:19:09.207
Like he said; He lost 
his fucking nut.

01:19:09.245 --> 01:19:11.472
Ain't no fucking surprise there, is it?

01:19:11.522 --> 01:19:12.944
Anyway, fuck him.

01:19:12.969 --> 01:19:14.978
You stay in here, alright?

01:19:15.003 --> 01:19:16.984
We need to focus.

01:19:17.086 --> 01:19:18.485
Let me talk to him.

01:19:21.377 --> 01:19:22.236
Trent.

01:19:22.990 --> 01:19:23.623
Trent.

01:19:23.662 --> 01:19:24.490
What?

01:19:24.620 --> 01:19:26.706
Alright, so what are 
we gonna do now?

01:19:26.826 --> 01:19:27.834
We'll be fine.

01:19:27.900 --> 01:19:29.267
We got plenty here.

01:19:30.342 --> 01:19:31.350
Mitch!

01:19:32.269 --> 01:19:33.254
Mitch!

01:19:45.424 --> 01:19:46.674
Mitch?!

01:20:37.129 --> 01:20:37.934
Here's Malor.

01:20:37.959 --> 01:20:39.583
- Were is he?
Hello Ange.

01:20:39.635 --> 01:20:41.088
I'm going to Fredcast to find him.

01:20:41.113 --> 01:20:42.408
Angie, he's fine.

01:20:42.435 --> 01:20:43.529
I've seen him.

01:20:43.554 --> 01:20:44.512
He's coming home.

01:20:44.537 --> 01:20:45.368
Are you with him?

01:20:45.400 --> 01:20:47.101
Not right now, no.
But I'm meeting him.

01:20:47.143 --> 01:20:50.452
He's not on the estate.
He's fine. He'll be home later.

01:20:50.486 --> 01:20:51.369
Where is he?

01:20:51.416 --> 01:20:55.035
Go home, wait.
I'll bring him to you, trust me.

01:26:09.603 --> 01:26:10.814
Yeah, this is me, it's Malor...

01:26:10.839 --> 01:26:13.459
I need an ambulance.

01:26:13.491 --> 01:26:16.538
A gunshot injury of 
urgent medical attention.

01:26:16.593 --> 01:26:19.913
I have the suspect
in custody.

01:26:22.842 --> 01:26:24.646
I've secured the gun.

01:26:26.187 --> 01:26:28.070
Just get an ambulance here, will you?

01:26:30.205 --> 01:26:31.869
Big tough guy like you...

01:26:31.923 --> 01:26:33.439
You'll be alright.

01:26:59.832 --> 01:27:01.489
You need a bit pressure on it.

01:27:03.094 --> 01:27:06.399
Oi, I made a promise to Angie
I would take you home, alright?

01:27:06.961 --> 01:27:08.492
So we get you patched up...

01:27:08.634 --> 01:27:09.908
And I'm gonna get you back.

01:27:18.095 --> 01:27:19.587
You're going home soon!

01:27:50.917 --> 01:27:53.455
I hope and pray,
that you make the right decision...

01:27:53.486 --> 01:27:55.807
And walk away from this fight.

01:27:55.841 --> 01:27:57.669
From this life...

01:27:57.929 --> 01:28:01.171
But even as I write this letter
I know that you won't...

01:28:01.443 --> 01:28:03.701
Because it's who we are.

01:28:04.264 --> 01:28:05.514
For me...

01:28:05.573 --> 01:28:08.269
To find the strenght and
courage to walk away...

01:28:08.463 --> 01:28:11.354
It took finding someone 
I couldn't affort to lose.

01:28:11.871 --> 01:28:14.332
Someone who loved me for who I am.

01:28:14.747 --> 01:28:15.974
And now...

01:28:16.008 --> 01:28:19.008
Because of a mistake I made
20 years ago...

01:28:19.432 --> 01:28:21.885
I find myself right back
where I started.

01:28:23.219 --> 01:28:24.422
Funny...

01:28:24.717 --> 01:28:26.733
How faith never forgets.

01:28:28.424 --> 01:28:30.940
One of us won't
be going home tomorrow.

01:28:31.916 --> 01:28:34.231
You and I both know that.

01:28:35.138 --> 01:28:37.673
But I guess there comes 
a point in every mans life...

01:28:37.712 --> 01:28:40.392
When he has to stop pretending
he's something he's not.

01:28:42.132 --> 01:28:43.945
I'll get my revenge for Mickey.

01:28:44.997 --> 01:28:46.794
He was a good man.

01:28:48.000 --> 01:28:49.914
You could've learned a lot from him...

01:28:50.487 --> 01:28:52.253
He would've told you to walk...

01:28:52.557 --> 01:28:54.784
Cause it's the bravest thing
you could do.

01:28:57.815 --> 01:29:00.518
No one ever drowned by 
getting in water, son.

01:29:02.016 --> 01:29:04.487
You'll only drown if you stay in it.
