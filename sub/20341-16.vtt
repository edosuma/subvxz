Bingo:
Hey, Rolly, what do you see?

01:06.208 --> 01:08.375
A great big pile
of couch cushions.

01:08.375 --> 01:11.458
You know what I see?
Mount Bingolly.

01:11.458 --> 01:13.375
That's "Bingo" and "Rolly"
put together.

01:13.375 --> 01:14.875
Oh, yeah!
Mount Bingolly.

01:14.875 --> 01:16.625
That's what I see
too, actually.

01:16.625 --> 01:19.375

Can you give me

Whoa!

01:56.583 --> 01:57.958
(dog toy squeaks)

01:57.958 --> 02:00.583
Rolly,
I think you celebrated
a little too hard.

02:00.583 --> 02:02.333
(laughs)

02:02.333 --> 02:05.416
Yeah, that was a pretty big
happy dance celebration,
wasn't it?

02:05.416 --> 02:08.833
Hey, there, guys.
Mind if I borrow a cushion?

02:08.833 --> 02:10.000
(chuckles)

02:11.500 --> 02:13.583
Hey, look what's on TV!

02:13.583 --> 02:16.291
Man:
Each year, as the weather
gets colder,

02:16.291 --> 02:18.000
thousands of butterflies

02:18.000 --> 02:19.875
journey from their
normal habitat

02:19.875 --> 02:22.291
to the Butterfly Forest,
near the beach,

02:22.291 --> 02:24.416
where it's sunny and warm.

02:25.416 --> 02:27.000
(all sigh)

02:29.958 --> 02:33.291
That butterfly looks a lot
like the ones on TV.

02:33.291 --> 02:34.958
Oh! Whoa!

02:34.958 --> 02:36.291
You're supposed to be
on a journey

02:36.291 --> 02:37.750
with thousands
of butterflies.

02:37.750 --> 02:38.833
(gasps)

02:38.833 --> 02:40.833
Did you get lost
from your butterfly family

02:40.833 --> 02:42.583
on the way to the beach,
little buddy?

02:42.583 --> 02:43.875
Oh, no!

02:43.875 --> 02:45.250
Poor flutterby.

02:45.250 --> 02:47.125
I mean-- butterfly!

02:47.125 --> 02:48.208
(giggling)

02:49.375 --> 02:51.500
Here you go, butterfly.

02:51.500 --> 02:53.875
Hope you catch up
to your family.

02:55.458 --> 02:58.083
Bye, guys.
See ya, Hissy.

02:58.083 --> 03:00.166
See ya after work!

03:02.000 --> 03:04.333
-Hey, there.
-Hi, hi, butterfly.

03:04.333 --> 03:05.833
(giggles)

03:05.833 --> 03:07.458
She's saying "hi"
in butterfly!

03:07.458 --> 03:10.458
Did you get lost
from your family,
like Bob said?

03:13.000 --> 03:16.000
-I think that's a yes.
-Then I think we have
our mission.

03:16.000 --> 03:17.875
We're going to help
this butterfly find
her family

03:17.875 --> 03:19.750
at the Butterfly Forest.

03:21.375 --> 03:23.000

03:23.000 --> 03:24.291
If you're gonna be
our travel buddy

03:24.291 --> 03:25.500
you need a name.

03:25.500 --> 03:26.958
How about Flutterpants?

03:26.958 --> 03:28.458
How about Flappyjacks?

03:28.458 --> 03:30.458
How about Vicki?

03:30.458 --> 03:31.875
-Really?
-Why?

03:31.875 --> 03:34.458
Her spots remind me
of a friend of mine
named Vicki.

03:35.458 --> 03:37.500
Hey, look,
she likes it.

and round.

05:32.708 --> 05:34.583
Eh, I can fix it,

05:34.583 --> 05:36.625
but you might
have to wait a while.

05:36.625 --> 05:39.000

pretty tricky.

We don't have
a while to wait.

05:41.708 --> 05:43.875
Vicki's family
is probably worried
about her.

05:45.625 --> 05:48.208

she's missing her family, too.

05:48.208 --> 05:49.708
It's okay, Vicki.

05:49.708 --> 05:52.291
You don't need
that big bus to take you
to your family.

05:52.291 --> 05:54.000
Yeah, 'cause you've got us.

05:54.000 --> 05:56.750
I think we need
to go that way,

05:56.750 --> 05:58.250

here we come.

is the Butterfly Forest?

I guess we better
think like butterflies
to figure it out.

06:20.375 --> 06:21.583
Yeah.

06:21.583 --> 06:23.750

06:23.750 --> 06:25.500
What are you
doing, Rolly?

06:25.500 --> 06:27.500
I'm acting like a butterfly
to help me think like one.

06:27.500 --> 06:29.000

06:39.166 --> 06:41.125

the Butterfly Forest

06:41.125 --> 06:42.458
was near the beach.

one of those kites.

Never mind.

09:58.583 --> 10:01.458

is back with her family,

10:34.000 --> 10:35.625
just like Bob wanted.

10:35.625 --> 10:37.958
Hi-paw, Rolly!

10:37.958 --> 10:39.250
(giggles)

10:39.250 --> 10:41.500
I think this is how they say
"thank you" in butterfly.

10:41.500 --> 10:43.875
(laughing)

10:43.875 --> 10:46.000
Butterfly
thank-yous tickle.

10:47.833 --> 10:50.000
Bye, Vicki. I'll miss you.

10:50.000 --> 10:51.416
Me, too.

10:54.208 --> 10:56.250
I'm glad Vicki's back
with her family.

10:56.250 --> 10:58.458
Yeah, that's pretty much
the best place to be.

10:58.458 --> 11:00.583
This calls
for a celebration.

11:00.583 --> 11:02.000
Rolly, do your thing!

11:02.000 --> 11:03.416
Yay!

11:03.416 --> 11:05.875
(giggling)

11:09.208 --> 11:11.750
Man (over TV):
Welcome back,
ladies and gentlemen.

11:11.750 --> 11:13.458
This is Clint Manly,

11:13.458 --> 11:16.000
and I am back
at the Butterfly Forest.

11:16.000 --> 11:19.000
I wonder if that butterfly
that was here this morning

11:19.000 --> 11:21.000
made it back
to its family.

11:21.000 --> 11:22.500
-She did, Bob.
-We took her there and--

11:22.500 --> 11:25.375
(barking)

11:25.375 --> 11:26.958
As you can see,

11:26.958 --> 11:29.208
visitors come from far and near

11:29.208 --> 11:31.375
to experience the wonders

11:31.375 --> 11:33.250
of the Butterfly Forest.

11:33.250 --> 11:35.125
We made it, Frank!

11:35.125 --> 11:38.083
I'm glad they finally
fixed that bus, huh?

11:38.083 --> 11:41.250
Esther! One landed on me.

11:41.250 --> 11:42.958
I think that's
our butterfly!

11:42.958 --> 11:44.875
It definitely
looks like Vicki.

11:44.875 --> 11:48.833
Rolly:
Yeah! I'd know our nose-landing
butterfly friend anywhere.

11:48.833 --> 11:50.708
Hold still, Frank,

11:50.708 --> 11:52.125
so I can take
a picture.

11:52.125 --> 11:55.250
Say, you look like
a friendly fellow.

11:55.250 --> 11:56.875
Are you enjoying
your trip

11:56.875 --> 11:59.083
to the Butterfly
Forest, sir?

11:59.083 --> 12:01.083
It's a dream
come true.

12:04.458 --> 12:05.833
(Bob laughing)

12:05.833 --> 12:08.416
Looks like that butterfly
is saying hi to us.

12:08.416 --> 12:10.583
Yeah,
I'm pretty sure she is.

12:10.583 --> 12:13.458
(pups giggling)

12:15.958 --> 12:18.250
(Bingo/Rolly speak)

12:21.083 --> 12:22.833
(sniffing)

12:22.833 --> 12:24.291
Smells like...
sidewalk.

12:24.291 --> 12:25.458
Yup.

12:25.458 --> 12:27.958
Hey, would you
look at that?

12:27.958 --> 12:29.875
Queen Kazoo
and Her Dog, Baboo

12:29.875 --> 12:30.875
is at this theater.

12:30.875 --> 12:32.583
That's my favorite play.

12:32.583 --> 12:34.875
I'd love to see it
performed on stage.

12:34.875 --> 12:36.166
Hi, Claude.

12:36.166 --> 12:39.083
I'd like to get one ticket
for today's show, please.

12:39.083 --> 12:40.583
I am sorry.

12:40.583 --> 12:43.000
All of those tickets
have been sold.

12:43.000 --> 12:46.458
(sad music playing)

12:50.000 --> 12:52.583
We do have one final
performance tonight!

12:52.583 --> 12:53.708
Great!

12:53.708 --> 12:57.000
But all of those tickets
have been sold too.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.083
Well, that's not
great at all.

12:59.083 --> 13:00.458
In the unlikely event

13:00.458 --> 13:02.083
that a ticket
becomes available,

13:02.083 --> 13:04.083
we'll get it to you, Bob.

13:04.083 --> 13:06.125
Okay, thanks.

13:06.125 --> 13:07.875
Aw. I really wanted

13:07.875 --> 13:09.583
to get a seat
at the theater,

13:09.583 --> 13:11.875
but there isn't even
one seat available.

13:11.875 --> 13:14.583
Imagine that.
Not even one.

13:14.583 --> 13:15.708
Ha!

13:17.375 --> 13:19.833
Okay, guys,
I'll see you later.

13:19.833 --> 13:21.583
Maybe we'll
do something fun.

13:21.583 --> 13:24.958
You know,
take my mind off
missing that show?

13:24.958 --> 13:25.958
(sighs)

13:25.958 --> 13:28.208
Not even one seat.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.750
I can't stop thinking
about how much Bob

13:31.750 --> 13:33.458
wanted to get a seat
at the theater.

13:33.458 --> 13:35.833
-The one with Queen Kazoo?
-And her dog Baboo.

13:35.833 --> 13:38.458
Well, maybe we should take
that seat there for him.

13:38.458 --> 13:39.875
That's a great idea!

13:39.875 --> 13:41.125
If we take his chair there,

13:41.125 --> 13:42.458
Bob can have a seat
at the theater,

13:42.458 --> 13:43.875
just like he wanted!

13:43.875 --> 13:45.416
But what about Hissy?

13:45.416 --> 13:46.708
(snoring)

13:46.708 --> 13:47.958
Do you think
we should wake her up?

13:47.958 --> 13:50.000
Hissy doesn't like it
when we wake her up.

13:50.000 --> 13:52.166
That's true.
She get's all grumpy.

13:52.166 --> 13:54.708
So I guess we'll have
to take Bob's seat
to the theater

13:54.708 --> 13:56.125
with Hissy still on it.

13:56.125 --> 13:57.708
Come on, sleeping Hissy,

you're coming on
our mission, too.

15:16.750 --> 15:17.875

already have seats there.

is to take that shortcut

through the
pillow stuffing factory.

15:28.583 --> 15:31.083
Then let's get

wake Hissy.

15:58.583 --> 16:00.708
Well, I hate to tell you this,

16:00.708 --> 16:02.958
but to get to that theater,

16:02.958 --> 16:04.416
you're gonna have
to push that thing

16:04.416 --> 16:06.708
up a really big hill.

16:06.708 --> 16:08.083
(Rolly groaning)

16:08.083 --> 16:09.458
Why can't the tops of hills

16:09.458 --> 16:11.125
be at the bottoms instead?

16:11.125 --> 16:14.291
That would make
pushing things
up them a lot easier.

16:14.291 --> 16:15.500
Keep going!

16:15.500 --> 16:17.458

Are we there yet?

16:19.000 --> 16:20.250
Yup!

16:20.250 --> 16:24.250
At the top of a hilly,
hill, hill!

16:24.250 --> 16:25.708
We did it, Rolly!

16:25.708 --> 16:27.291
Hi-paw!

16:27.291 --> 16:28.208
Where to now?

16:28.208 --> 16:30.208
Well, first you should
probably

16:30.208 --> 16:32.000
go running after
that sit-on-y thingy

16:32.000 --> 16:33.000
that's rolling away.

16:37.458 --> 16:39.208
This chair goes down hills

16:39.208 --> 16:41.333
a lot faster
than it goes up them!

16:41.333 --> 16:43.458
Which means we
have to go even faster.

16:45.708 --> 16:47.333
-We made it!
-Hang on!

16:47.333 --> 16:48.958

16:55.208 --> 16:57.208
Hey, can you take these
things to the theater

16:57.208 --> 16:59.000

that play?

16:59.000 --> 17:00.500

they're doing that play.

trying to get to?

is get this chair inside

17:30.375 --> 17:32.708
and we'll have done
exactly what Bob wanted.

17:37.375 --> 17:38.708
Is this where the people
in the play

17:38.708 --> 17:40.333
get ready to go out
on stage?

We need a throne,
or we can't do the play!

17:59.833 --> 18:02.291

have to use this chair

18:02.291 --> 18:03.375

20:05.583 --> 20:08.250
Yeah, you went,
"pew, pew, pew, pew, pew!"

20:08.250 --> 20:09.458
And he couldn't keep up.

20:09.458 --> 20:11.250
Yuck. Okay...

20:11.250 --> 20:13.083
So, are you guys
gonna explain to me

20:13.083 --> 20:14.708
how I fell asleep
at our house,

20:14.708 --> 20:16.500
and ended up on a stage

20:16.500 --> 20:18.583
with the queen
of Dogsylvania?

20:18.583 --> 20:20.458
(laughs)
We were on a mission.

20:20.458 --> 20:22.333
Yeah, should have
guessed mission.

20:22.333 --> 20:24.583
(rattling)

20:24.583 --> 20:26.000
Oh, boy.

20:26.000 --> 20:29.083
Yeah, Queen Kazoo
can't sit on a regular chair.

20:29.083 --> 20:30.875
She needs a throne.

20:33.000 --> 20:35.833
Now Bob still doesn't
have a seat at the theater.

20:35.833 --> 20:38.583
Yeah. I guess we failed
our mission.

20:38.583 --> 20:39.708
Nobody failed.

20:39.708 --> 20:42.333
Your mission was to get
Bob's chair to the theater,

20:42.333 --> 20:44.291
which is exactly what you did.

20:44.291 --> 20:47.375
Now, if you can help me
get this tape off of me,

20:47.375 --> 20:50.333
we'll figure out how
to get Bob to that show.

20:50.333 --> 20:52.416
Uh, Hissy?

20:52.416 --> 20:53.291
What?

20:54.583 --> 20:56.375
Bob is going
to that show.

20:56.375 --> 20:58.500
(gasps)
That's a ticket
for tonight.

20:58.500 --> 20:59.375
Come on, pups!

21:00.458 --> 21:03.291
Our new mission
is to get this to Bob.

21:03.291 --> 21:04.708
-Woo-hoo!
-Yeah!

21:04.708 --> 21:05.958
Okay, doggies,

21:05.958 --> 21:08.000
let's bring it home.

21:08.000 --> 21:09.583
All: Puppy power!

21:12.458 --> 21:14.375
Here he comes! Get ready!

21:16.583 --> 21:18.333
Hey, there, fellas!

21:18.333 --> 21:20.583
(barking)

21:20.583 --> 21:22.375
We got you a seat
at the theater, Bob!

21:22.375 --> 21:23.500
Just like you wanted!

21:23.500 --> 21:25.750
First we pushed it there,
and then we pushed it back.

21:25.750 --> 21:27.708
(barking)

21:27.708 --> 21:29.625
(chuckles)
Okay, guys, easy.

21:29.625 --> 21:31.708
Hold on.
Just let me check my mail

21:31.708 --> 21:33.625
and then the three of us
can play together.

21:35.875 --> 21:37.416
Oh! (chuckles)

21:37.416 --> 21:39.166
Excuse me, Hissy.

21:39.166 --> 21:41.625
I need a place to sit myself.

21:41.625 --> 21:43.583
Uh-oh!

21:43.583 --> 21:46.750
Oh, what a sticky mess.

21:46.750 --> 21:48.583
What's this?

21:48.583 --> 21:49.708
Hey!

21:49.708 --> 21:52.500
It's a ticket for tonight's
performance of...

21:52.500 --> 21:54.708
Queen Kazoo and Her
Dog, Baboo!

21:54.708 --> 21:56.291
They must have found
an extra one

21:56.291 --> 21:57.708
and sent it to me,

21:57.708 --> 21:59.708
like Claude said they would.

21:59.708 --> 22:01.000
Which means...

22:01.000 --> 22:02.583
I get to see the play,

22:02.583 --> 22:05.375
which is what I wanted
most of all!

22:05.375 --> 22:09.416
As queen of Dogsylvania,
I say to thee,

22:09.416 --> 22:12.000
let my puppies go!

22:12.000 --> 22:13.458
(chuckles)

22:13.458 --> 22:15.166
Isn't this play great?

22:15.166 --> 22:17.583
We go to every performance
in every city.

22:17.583 --> 22:20.750
I hope they do that
chasing-through-the-aisles
thing again!

22:20.750 --> 22:23.250
That was a tour de farce!

22:23.250 --> 22:25.291
Thanks for letting us
watch the show from here.

22:25.291 --> 22:27.750
I'm glad you came back
to see the rest of it,

22:27.750 --> 22:30.458
and that your friend, Bob,
is seeing it too.

22:30.458 --> 22:32.375
Yeah, he wanted a seat
at the theater,

22:32.375 --> 22:34.500
and there he is,
with the best seat
in the house.

22:34.500 --> 22:36.708
Let the woofers go forth,

22:36.708 --> 22:39.416
and the barkers run free.

22:39.416 --> 22:41.583
You're on, puppies.

22:44.000 --> 22:46.458
(barking)

22:46.458 --> 22:48.500
(audience applause)

22:48.500 --> 22:50.875
(Bob laughing)

22:56.583 --> 22:58.583
(theme music playing)

23:00.833 --> 23:02.000
Bark! Bark! Bark!

23:05.958 --> 23:07.458
Bark! Bark!
Bark!

23:08.583 --> 23:09.750
(record scratching)

23:17.458 --> 23:18.458
Bark!

23:21.958 --> 23:23.458
Bark! Bark! Bark!
