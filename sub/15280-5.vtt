WEBVTT

00:07.330 --> 00:08.820
Bye, guys.
JORDAN: Thank you.

00:08.830 --> 00:11.116
That was fun.
JORDAN: Right. Walk. Walk.

00:11.710 --> 00:13.575
Bye. Bye.

00:15.080 --> 00:17.492
-You know, I really...
-No, no, no, no.

00:17.500 --> 00:20.742
-Do not start with the "I love yous."
-I do.

00:20.750 --> 00:23.412
-You only say it when you're drunk.
-That's not true.

00:23.420 --> 00:26.036
-Oh, okay. Look, I'm driving.
-I'm not drunk.

00:26.040 --> 00:28.281
I'm just buzzed a little bit.

00:28.290 --> 00:30.326
"Buzzed a little bit"
is something that drunk people say

00:30.330 --> 00:33.037
to convince themselves
that they're not drunk.

00:34.040 --> 00:38.409
Yeah. No, no, no. Nope. Nope.
Touch your fingers to your nose.

00:38.420 --> 00:40.536
-What?
-Do It.

00:40.540 --> 00:43.327
All right. Come here.
Come here. Come here.

00:43.330 --> 00:44.877
Your fingers.

00:45.960 --> 00:49.452
-Walk a straight line.
- All right.

01:01.960 --> 01:04.372
-Okay, you can drive.
-All right. Thank you very...

01:04.380 --> 01:06.166
Slowly, though. No speeding.

01:10.960 --> 01:12.166
Hey.

01:12.170 --> 01:14.491
Get your eyes on the road, Casanova.

01:14.500 --> 01:18.038
-Just tell me you love me, come on.
-I do love you.

01:18.830 --> 01:20.878
-Good.
-Now get your eyes on the road.

01:20.880 --> 01:22.199
Jordan!

01:29.710 --> 01:32.998
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

01:35.250 --> 01:38.913
What the hell is he doing just sitting
in the middle of the road?

01:50.710 --> 01:53.247
Maybe he had a breakdown
and he couldn't move it.

02:11.290 --> 02:12.325
Jordan.

02:13.580 --> 02:15.457
Jordan, we should go.

02:15.460 --> 02:18.031
We can just turn around
and go back the way we came.

02:18.040 --> 02:20.497
Why didn't they just pull it off
the side of the road?

02:22.790 --> 02:24.781
Jordan? Jordan.

02:26.790 --> 02:29.167
Jordan, can we please just go?
Come on.

02:46.170 --> 02:49.742
-Do you have the keys

02:50.420 --> 02:53.162
Yeah, I think. I don't know but...

02:53.170 --> 02:55.161
They have to be here somewhere.

03:01.080 --> 03:02.240
Trish...

03:11.210 --> 03:13.451
So what happened with you and J]
at the Redskins game, huh?

03:13.460 --> 03:14.745
-Top secret.
-Derek.

03:14.750 --> 03:15.990
-Hey.
-Hey.

03:16.000 --> 03:18.912
I put the transcript from the last
prison interview on your desk.

03:18.920 --> 03:22.117
Okay. It wasn't classified rush.
You could've sent it interoffice.

03:22.120 --> 03:23.451
I could have.

03:28.670 --> 03:31.616
-Must be tough, man.
-Not really.

03:31.620 --> 03:33.076
What do you mean?
You don't do anything,

03:33.080 --> 03:34.616
and these women
are throwmg themselves at you.

03:34.620 --> 03:36.281
Strictly off-limits, Reid.

03:36.290 --> 03:38.702
There's no code of conduct
that says agents can't socrallze.

03:38.710 --> 03:40.200
Yeah, well, see,
my code of survival says

03:40.210 --> 03:43.111
never mess with a woman
who carries a gun.

03:46.540 --> 03:49.373
So, it sounds like bed rest isn't
turning out to be very restful.

03:49.380 --> 03:51.917
Bed rest is more like bed agony.

03:52.880 --> 03:57.453
But in ten minutes, I get to switch
to my right side. That'll be a thrill.

03:58.830 --> 04:01.617
Honey, just try to relax
and get a little rest, okay?

04:01.620 --> 04:02.700
Of course.

04:03.290 --> 04:04.450
I love you.

04:04.880 --> 04:06.029
Bye.

04:07.000 --> 04:08.240
Everything all right?

04:08.250 --> 04:11.071
Yeah, the doctors are worried
about Haley's blood sugar levels.

04:11.080 --> 04:12.707
They're worried about pre-eclampsia

04:12.710 --> 04:14.701
and I'm worried she's not gonna last
six weeks in bed.

04:14.710 --> 04:17.031
-She wants out of the hospital.
-Yeah.

04:17.380 --> 04:18.779
-Is it here?
-Yeah.

04:18.790 --> 04:19.996
Right.
WOMAN: Right.

04:20.000 --> 04:21.820
Reid. Morgan.
Documents up on the screen

04:21.830 --> 04:23.707
regarding the kidnapping
of Trish Davenport.

04:23.710 --> 04:24.825
Have you read them yet?

04:24.830 --> 04:27.822
Yeah, I got a copy
from the document examiner.

04:28.960 --> 04:32.111
What's it say?
-That we've got until 8:00 tonight.

04:32.790 --> 04:35.031
"You will follow instructions carefully.

04:35.040 --> 04:38.203
"You will do this to ensure the safety
of your daughter.

04:38.210 --> 04:41.953
00 pm.

04:41.960 --> 04:45.873
"You will write down the instructions
and follow them to the letter."

04:46.420 --> 04:48.820
That gives us less than
nine hours to get to Connecticut,

04:48.830 --> 04:50.616
work up victimology on Trish Davenport,

04:50.620 --> 04:52.872
and prepare her father
for the ransom drop.

04:52.880 --> 04:55.030
How do we know the letter's real?

04:55.790 --> 04:58.031
Uh,
handwriting is a match for Trish's.

04:58.040 --> 05:02.374
He dictated it to her.
And they found saline on the paper.

05:03.750 --> 05:05.069
Her tears.

05:05.830 --> 05:09.823
He never says "I."
He doesn't say "I will call."

05:09.830 --> 05:12.037
He says "You will answer the call."

05:12.290 --> 05:14.451
He's distancing himself
from the kidnapping.

05:14.460 --> 05:16.451
If he said "I" he'd be
taking responsibility for it.

05:16.460 --> 05:17.745
There's also another missing element.

05:17.750 --> 05:19.240
No mention of the police.

05:19.250 --> 05:22.879
Ransom notes almost always forbid
police involvement.

05:22.880 --> 05:25.075
So is he expecting law enforcement
to get involved?

05:25.080 --> 05:28.959
Well, if he's expecting us,
let's not disappoint him.

06:03.290 --> 06:06.953
Euripides said,
"When a good man is hurt,

06:06.960 --> 06:10.111
"all who would be called good
must suffer with him."

06:11.880 --> 06:13.450
Everyone familiar with the father?

06:13.460 --> 06:16.167
Evan Davenport, US. Attorney,
Executive Assistant,

06:16.170 --> 06:18.070
Southern District, New York. Widower.

06:18.080 --> 06:19.786
Assigned US. Marshals three times

06:19.790 --> 06:21.951
in the past 10 years due to death threats.

06:21.960 --> 06:24.246
-Is the protective detail still current?
-Around the clock.

06:24.250 --> 06:26.912
But Trish declined protection
when she turned 18.

06:26.920 --> 06:29.707
-Too bad for the boyfriend.
-But why kill him?

06:29.710 --> 06:30.870
Well, if I want to kidnap someone,

06:36.380 --> 06:38.575
Says here she's got a sister.
-Cheryl.

06:38.580 --> 06:43.165
-Any problems -Yeah. They're identical twins.

06:46.670 --> 06:48.376
Please, come in.

06:48.380 --> 06:50.416
I have six people on my staff.

06:50.420 --> 06:52.991
I have three bodyguards.
They've all had polygraphs.

06:53.000 --> 06:54.991
Everybody has been vetted.

06:55.000 --> 06:57.286
And they all have alibis
for the night of the kidnapping?

06:57.290 --> 07:00.327
All accounted for
by the local FBI field office unit.

07:00.330 --> 07:01.786
Cheryl flew in yesterday.

07:01.790 --> 07:04.873
I'm just making sure
that she's not alone even for...

07:07.540 --> 07:11.203
Sorry. Just feeling like
I'm suffocating here.

07:11.710 --> 07:13.575
I just want somebody to tell me
that she's okay.

07:14.380 --> 07:15.745
Dr. Reid?

07:17.500 --> 07:19.616
What do the statistics tell us?

07:19.620 --> 07:22.077
That if you follow their instructions
and give them the money,

07:22.080 --> 07:23.911
your daughter will be returned.

07:23.920 --> 07:26.616
Done. This house is bug-free.

07:26.620 --> 07:28.451
All right, bring it in.

07:29.830 --> 07:33.072
So, what are your theories so far
about this kidnapper?

07:33.080 --> 07:34.411
That he targeted you for a reason.

07:34.830 --> 07:37.742
Every line of the letter starts
with the word "you."

07:38.750 --> 07:42.459
He's angry at you.
He probably feels like you owe him.

07:45.170 --> 07:49.038
That everything you own,
you don't deserve.

07:50.790 --> 07:52.326
And from the language in the ransom,

07:52.330 --> 07:55.072
we most likely believe
that he's working alone.

08:23.790 --> 08:26.748
What's she doing?
AIDE 1: Lying on the road.

08:27.170 --> 08:28.956
Yeah, I see that. But why?

08:30.380 --> 08:33.611
She's trying to get a feel
for what happened to her sister.

08:33.620 --> 08:34.780
By lying on the ground?

08:34.790 --> 08:38.203
That girl spent her teenage years
perfecting ways to ditch her bodyguards.

08:38.210 --> 08:40.667
We're just happy
she's in our line of sight.

08:51.080 --> 08:52.570
Cheryl Davenport?

08:52.580 --> 08:53.911
Shh.

08:55.420 --> 08:56.705
Just a minute.

08:57.580 --> 09:00.822
No, I'm not crazy.
I'm lying here for a reason.

09:15.500 --> 09:17.786
He dragged her from the car.

09:19.670 --> 09:21.911
This is where she fell.
Trish is a fighter.

09:21.920 --> 09:24.536
She wouldn't have gone quietly.
Not even with a gun pointed at her.

09:24.540 --> 09:27.873
She's right.
There are nail marks on the car seat.

09:29.580 --> 09:33.368
-So you believe your sister's still alive?
-I know she's still alive.

09:33.380 --> 09:35.951
You know the way twins know?

09:37.420 --> 09:40.241
Not the "I can feel my twin's pain" crap.

09:40.250 --> 09:42.286
If you stick her with a needle,
I don't cry out.

09:42.290 --> 09:47.205
But if something is bothering her,
if something is wrong, I can feel it.

09:47.210 --> 09:50.111
Even from a thousand miles away
at college.

09:50.960 --> 09:52.416
You study physics, right?

09:52.420 --> 09:53.990
If you're asking
why a science major

09:54.000 --> 09:57.413
would believe in something
non-scientific, I don't.

09:57.880 --> 09:59.279
I just know what I feel.

10:02.670 --> 10:04.911
My feeling is that
my sister is still alive.

10:09.920 --> 10:13.492
They're not entirely identical.
They're mirror twins.

10:14.540 --> 10:18.283
Some of Trish's organs are on the
right side that should be on the left.

10:18.290 --> 10:20.281
Doctors assured us
that it wasn't life-threatening.

10:20.290 --> 10:23.032
-Situs inversus.
-Yeah.

10:23.920 --> 10:27.162
-They had self-defense training?
-Yeah, I insisted on it.

10:27.790 --> 10:32.113
The protective detail rankled
when they hit puberty

10:32.120 --> 10:36.454
and I was sure that
they would refuse their bodyguards

10:36.460 --> 10:37.609
when they left for college...

10:37.620 --> 10:39.747
Excuse me,
can you actually read that fast?

10:39.750 --> 10:42.958
Our conscious minds can process
16-bits of information per second.

10:42.960 --> 10:45.667
Our unconscious, however,
can process 11 million.

10:47.830 --> 10:50.412
Yes, I can actually read this fast.

10:50.420 --> 10:53.116
If whoever took her
wants me to blow cases

10:53.120 --> 10:55.611
or suppress evidence or stand down, I...

10:55.620 --> 10:57.827
What makes you think
it's someone you're prosecuting?

10:57.830 --> 10:59.286
Well, I have money,
but I don't have millions.

10:59.290 --> 11:00.666
I mean, what else could it be?

11:00.670 --> 11:05.073
In our experience, Mr. Davenport,
every case is different.

11:13.080 --> 11:15.492
What is he doing?
ELLE: He's role-playing.

11:17.500 --> 11:19.320
How does that work?

11:20.120 --> 11:23.829
He's trying to think
like the kidnapper.

11:23.830 --> 11:26.788
He's trying to get a sense of him
through his behavior.

11:28.420 --> 11:31.412
That doesn't sound very scientific,
does it?

11:36.960 --> 11:39.611
Okay, she was rarely
without the boyfriend.

11:43.670 --> 11:47.413
Well, I know in order to get to her,
I gotta take him out.

11:48.790 --> 11:50.872
He was collateral damage.

11:57.250 --> 11:58.660
Or was he?

12:00.460 --> 12:02.997
The shot was to the face,
that's personal.

12:16.540 --> 12:18.417
Kill the boyfriend.

12:20.790 --> 12:23.532
Get him out of the way,
so I can get her...

12:28.210 --> 12:29.529
Alone.

12:32.210 --> 12:34.030
This button answers the call.

12:34.040 --> 12:36.782
This button makes everyone
in the room silent. It will flash red.

12:36.790 --> 12:38.576
You'll be able to hear his side
of the conversation,

12:38.580 --> 12:39.877
he won't be able to hear us.

12:39.880 --> 12:42.531
We'll be running the trace
through the field office, Evan.

12:42.540 --> 12:45.577
You're in good hands
with Agent Gideon and his team.

12:46.830 --> 12:48.491
You think Cheryl's a wack job

12:48.500 --> 12:50.957
because she claims _
she can feel her Sister's anxrety?

12:50.960 --> 12:52.370
I never said wack job.

12:52.380 --> 12:54.746
Actually there may be
a physiological basis for it.

12:54.750 --> 12:55.910
Don't ask.

12:55.920 --> 12:58.536
Reversed asymmetry
monozygotic eggs split late.

12:58.540 --> 12:59.700
Between nine to 12 days.

12:59.710 --> 13:02.076
The DNA matches right down
to the very last stranded code.

13:02.080 --> 13:05.709
And there's sporadic documentation
of shared physiological pain.

13:05.710 --> 13:08.668
-And you believe it?
-Oh, I'm just saying it's possible.

13:08.670 --> 13:09.785
I don't know everything.

13:09.790 --> 13:11.200
I mean, despite the fact
that you think that I do.

13:11.210 --> 13:12.700
I never said that.
When have I ever said that?

13:12.710 --> 13:14.826
-Every day since I've met you.
-This morning at breakfast.

13:14.830 --> 13:18.163
Yesterday when he beat you at cards.
We've got one minute.

13:18.170 --> 13:20.161
-Anybody ever heard of sarcasm?
-Mmm-mmm.

13:39.000 --> 13:43.073
Remember, keep your voice even and calm.

13:44.250 --> 13:46.787
And agree with everything he says.

13:56.290 --> 13:58.667
He'll call.

13:58.670 --> 14:01.571
Just try to relax. This is a strategy.
He wants you on edge.

14:08.620 --> 14:10.918
Remember to repeat
any important information he gives you

14:10.920 --> 14:13.115
to make sure you understand.

14:13.120 --> 14:15.111
You try to keep him talking.

14:15.120 --> 14:18.374
To reveal something about Trish
or about himself.

14:21.500 --> 14:23.161
This is Evan Davenport.

14:25.040 --> 14:27.076
Hello, Mr. Davenport.

14:28.670 --> 14:31.377
Are you the man
who has my daughter, Patricia?

14:32.620 --> 14:34.201
I have your daughter.

14:36.420 --> 14:39.457
-Can I ask you...-You may ask me nothing.

14:39.460 --> 14:41.166
This is not an interrogatory.

14:41.170 --> 14:43.570
You will listen only to my instructions.

14:43.580 --> 14:46.458
-Okay.-But I will not give them to you.

14:47.500 --> 14:48.876
I don't understand...

14:48.880 --> 14:52.327
I do not want to talk to you,
Mr. Davenport.

14:53.620 --> 14:54.780
Excuse me?

14:56.040 --> 14:57.667
I want to talk to her.

14:59.080 --> 15:01.878
I want to talk to Cheryl.

15:08.540 --> 15:09.916
What's he doing?

15:10.170 --> 15:12.411
What most of the offenders we catch
try to do.

15:12.420 --> 15:13.660
Establish dominance.

15:13.670 --> 15:15.319
How long can we keep him on hold?

15:15.330 --> 15:16.820
We can't put her on.

15:16.830 --> 15:19.993
Why not? I want to help.
I'll talk to him.

15:20.000 --> 15:22.207
Cheryl doesn't have the authority
that Davenport holds.

15:22.210 --> 15:23.495
He shouldn't want to talk to her.

15:23.500 --> 15:24.990
I think that she should speak to him.

15:25.000 --> 15:29.073
Do I need to repeat myself?
I want to talk to Cheryl.

15:29.080 --> 15:31.537
Put her on the phone. Now.

15:31.540 --> 15:32.700
No.

15:32.710 --> 15:34.996
I think she should speak to him.
He wants to talk to her.

15:35.000 --> 15:37.161
The more he speaks,
the more he reveals.

15:37.170 --> 15:39.616
-She is right, Gideon.
-He has my sister.

15:42.830 --> 15:44.036
No.

15:44.040 --> 15:45.701
I'm waiting.

15:45.710 --> 15:46.745
Elle.

15:52.080 --> 15:53.115
Okay.

15:55.040 --> 15:56.667
This is Cheryl.

15:57.580 --> 15:59.411
Hello, this is Cheryl.

15:59.420 --> 16:02.617
I have Patricia by my side.
I know her voice.

16:02.620 --> 16:07.319
Therefore, I know her sister's.
Get off the phone. I want Cheryl.

16:07.330 --> 16:08.957
I'll give you 60 seconds.

16:08.960 --> 16:10.780
If you don't put her on the phone,
I will hang up

16:10.790 --> 16:14.032
and you will never hear
from me or Patricia again.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.531
Prep work.
Come on over here, please.

16:16.540 --> 16:17.916
Fifty seconds.

16:17.920 --> 16:20.241
Okay, this guy's arrogant.

16:20.880 --> 16:24.372
Let him know that he's in control.
Let him guide the conversation.

16:24.380 --> 16:25.529
Forty.

16:25.540 --> 16:26.746
Use your sister's name.

16:26.750 --> 16:30.618
Say "My sister, Trish"
or "Her name's Patricia."

16:30.620 --> 16:31.871
Thirty-five seconds.

16:31.880 --> 16:33.029
-Okay.
-Talk about her.

16:33.040 --> 16:35.747
Let him get to know her through you.

16:36.460 --> 16:39.782
-Don't veer off topic.
-Got it.

16:40.080 --> 16:41.286
Agree with him.

16:41.290 --> 16:42.826
Twenty-five seconds.

16:42.830 --> 16:44.286
Tell him that you understand him.

16:44.290 --> 16:47.168
And as hard as this sounds, empathize.

16:47.170 --> 16:48.319
Twenty seconds.

16:48.330 --> 16:52.448
Let him know that he didn't mean
to hurt Trish or go this far.

16:52.460 --> 16:54.872
-And that he can fix it.
-Okay.

16:54.880 --> 16:57.417
He has a chance to show that he's a kind

16:57.420 --> 17:01.072
and forgiving person
by letting your sister go.

17:01.080 --> 17:02.661
Ten seconds.

17:02.670 --> 17:05.878
And if you don't know what to say,
I'll tell you.

17:07.420 --> 17:11.914
Three, two, one.

17:16.920 --> 17:18.160
This is Cheryl.

17:19.120 --> 17:21.998
Hello, Cheryl. How are you?

17:28.710 --> 17:31.452
I'd be a lot better
if I knew that my sister...

17:32.580 --> 17:35.071
That Patricia's okay.

17:37.880 --> 17:41.577
I can tell you have
a lot of empathy, Cheryl.

17:41.580 --> 17:43.286
You care about others.

17:44.540 --> 17:46.167
Yes, I do.

17:46.710 --> 17:48.666
And it sounds like you understand.

17:48.670 --> 17:50.991
You mean that I empathize?

17:52.500 --> 17:54.206
-Yes.-I do.

17:54.210 --> 17:57.532
Very much. I empathize.

17:57.540 --> 18:02.739
I empathize with you, Cheryl.
I know you want to be with your sister.

18:03.290 --> 18:04.951
Yes. I want Trish back.

18:04.960 --> 18:08.748
Good. Tell me what you want, Cheryl.

18:09.290 --> 18:12.669
I'm very interested.
Tell me all about yourself.

18:12.670 --> 18:14.615
What's your favorite color?

18:15.210 --> 18:18.031
Don't answer that. Stay with Trish.

18:22.170 --> 18:24.991
If I tell you will you let me talk
to my sister?

18:26.500 --> 18:28.991
Maybe. Maybe not.

18:32.080 --> 18:33.490
I like blue.

18:34.580 --> 18:36.320
How ordinary.

18:37.420 --> 18:40.492
Do you like chocolate, Cheryl?

18:43.330 --> 18:48.415
Do you like chocolate?

18:48.420 --> 18:50.706
-Yes.-I do as well.

18:52.080 --> 18:54.162
Please let me talk to my sister.

19:06.420 --> 19:08.661
All I want to do is hear her voice.

19:09.920 --> 19:11.160
Please.

19:17.040 --> 19:18.496
Hello?

19:18.500 --> 19:21.116
Cher...-Trish!

19:21.120 --> 19:24.999
-Cheryl, is that you?-Trish, it's me.

19:25.710 --> 19:28.031
I'm here. Are you okay?

19:28.380 --> 19:30.871
Cheryl, I can't...

19:32.250 --> 19:34.070
Where are you

19:34.080 --> 19:38.073
I see the moon.

19:40.290 --> 19:42.326
Trish! Trish!

19:42.330 --> 19:44.207
Have $500,000 ready.

19:44.500 --> 19:45.660
Let me talk to her!

19:45.670 --> 19:47.661
$500,000 is what I'm owed.

19:47.670 --> 19:49.535
The Davenports will wait by the phone.

19:49.540 --> 19:54.204
You will receive a call with precise
instructions in exactly 15 minutes.

20:01.790 --> 20:03.496
-Were you able to trace it?
-No.

20:03.500 --> 20:05.161
He's probably using
a disposable cell phone.

20:05.170 --> 20:06.956
They're impossible to trace.

20:06.960 --> 20:08.951
She said she could see the moon.

20:08.960 --> 20:12.032
She was sedated.

20:12.790 --> 20:14.030
Could've been a light.

20:14.040 --> 20:16.747
If he's keeping her drugged
it might mean he's not very strong.

20:16.750 --> 20:19.207
He might have to keep her weak
just so he can dominate her.

20:19.210 --> 20:21.326
Or he's keeping her quiet.

20:22.210 --> 20:24.326
Has Davenport told us everything
about his staff?

20:24.330 --> 20:26.321
Yeah. We have detailed reports

20:26.330 --> 20:28.286
but we should probably revisit background

20:28.290 --> 20:30.531
on household staff,
aides and current docket.

20:32.080 --> 20:33.616
Guys, she wasn't blindfolded.

20:35.040 --> 20:36.246
No.

20:36.250 --> 20:39.572
If she's seen his face,
as soon as he gets that money...

20:40.040 --> 20:41.280
He'll kill her.

20:45.500 --> 20:48.071
Roger, we're still secure here.

20:48.830 --> 20:52.573
He said "owed."
REID: $500,000.

20:52.920 --> 20:57.118
His demand sounded scripted.
Like he was reading it to us.

20:57.120 --> 20:58.701
But the rest of
the conversation wasn't.

20:58.710 --> 21:01.076
He was his most relaxed
just talking to Cheryl.

21:01.080 --> 21:03.822
What does that mean?
-Maybe he already knew her.

21:03.830 --> 21:06.116
How much time we got?
REID: Six minutes.

21:06.120 --> 21:08.702
How quickly can you get the money?

21:22.750 --> 21:24.911
Look, I know I shouldn't drink
but under the circumstances,

21:24.920 --> 21:27.377
you think you could let this one slide?

21:27.380 --> 21:30.872
He's going to call back.
We need you at your best.

21:31.790 --> 21:34.281
Have you had many cases like this?

21:34.290 --> 21:36.531
I've seen my share of abductions.

21:37.790 --> 21:40.532
I don't know how you do it, this job.

21:41.540 --> 21:45.499
-How do you stomach it?
-The men I hunt down are cowards.

21:45.500 --> 21:48.162
For the most part, they target
the weakest members of society.

21:48.170 --> 21:50.035
Women and children.

21:50.040 --> 21:54.204
There is nothing I'd rather do more
than put the bastards away.

21:56.880 --> 21:59.110
Just wish you could get them before
they snatch someone.

21:59.120 --> 22:01.953
Trish is alive_. _
You've trusted your feelings this far.

22:01.960 --> 22:03.325
Hold onto that.

22:16.670 --> 22:19.286
Everything will be done by Cheryl.

22:19.290 --> 22:23.613
Cheryl will gather the money packets.
Only she will touch the money.

22:24.580 --> 22:26.616
Cheryl will make the drop.

22:26.620 --> 22:30.112
If she is wired, if you use a look-alike,
Patricia dies.

22:30.750 --> 22:32.286
Cheryl will get in her car.

22:32.290 --> 22:35.828
No one is to be in the car with her.
No one is to follow her.

22:35.830 --> 22:38.242
No air surveillance, no car surveillance

22:38.250 --> 22:40.377
of any kind will be tolerated.

22:41.000 --> 22:44.037
I will give directions over a cell phone
as Cheryl drives.

22:44.040 --> 22:46.998
00 am.

22:47.000 --> 22:49.742
She will follow each instruction
to the letter.

22:55.420 --> 22:56.990
We can't let her go alone.

22:57.000 --> 22:58.820
He said if he sees anyone...

22:58.830 --> 23:02.379
I know. One car. Unmarked.
Tinted windows.

23:08.250 --> 23:11.117
If he sees one of you and Trish dies...

23:12.420 --> 23:14.376
If my daughter dies...

23:21.000 --> 23:23.912
Cheryl's car has GPS.
We'll be able to track her.

23:23.920 --> 23:26.662
Doc, the first thing he's
going to do is have her switch cars.

23:26.670 --> 23:28.661
-Where we headed?-Let's see...

23:29.880 --> 23:32.451
An address which appears to be...

23:34.120 --> 23:35.280
A rental car lot.

23:59.750 --> 24:01.320
You know my guess?

24:01.330 --> 24:04.914
One of these cars has a set of keys
already in the ignition

24:04.920 --> 24:06.876
with a disposable cell phone
sitting right in it.

24:06.880 --> 24:08.996
-So she switches cars and phones.
-Mmm-hmm.

24:15.380 --> 24:16.574
Five minutes.

24:28.460 --> 24:30.416
He's probably gonna have her
drive around for over an hour

24:30.420 --> 24:31.819
just to make sure no one's following her.

24:31.830 --> 24:33.821
And then the ransom drop.

24:38.830 --> 24:40.616
What is it

24:40.620 --> 24:42.668
Something's not right about this.

24:43.500 --> 24:45.991
What if he was watching us

24:46.000 --> 24:47.319
Local office did a bug sweep.

24:47.330 --> 24:49.571
-Come on. You heard that ransom call.
-Yeah.

24:49.580 --> 24:51.116
It was way too simple.

24:52.710 --> 24:56.919
All right, you're the UnSub.
What would you have done differently?

24:56.920 --> 24:59.912
I would have said,
"Don't involve the police or the media.

24:59.920 --> 25:04.038
"$500,000, no consecutive
serial numbers on the bills.

25:04.040 --> 25:08.613
"No marked bills. No new bills.
No tracking devices in the money bag.

25:08.620 --> 25:11.669
"No explosive dyes in the money bag.
No tracking devices in the car."

25:11.670 --> 25:14.070
Okay. Why didn't he say any of this?

25:25.170 --> 25:27.536
Hotch, this was never about the money.

25:29.380 --> 25:32.372
-It's not a ransom drop.
-It's a second kidnapping.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.116
Get down! Get down!

25:37.750 --> 25:38.990
Don't move!

25:51.170 --> 25:52.990
Cheryl's all right.

25:54.330 --> 25:55.820
Hey.

25:55.830 --> 25:57.536
Hi, Hotch.

26:11.920 --> 26:14.161
That was fun, wasn't it?

26:14.170 --> 26:17.617
A little running around,
getting our pulses racing?

26:18.830 --> 26:20.457
Are you there, Cheryl?

26:21.380 --> 26:22.916
Are you there?

26:23.920 --> 26:29.529
Tell me you didn't feel a slight tingle,
a thrill run up your spine

26:29.920 --> 26:32.457
But those clever and cunning FBI agents

26:32.460 --> 26:35.202
deduced my little plan just in time.
They figured it out.

26:35.210 --> 26:37.701
If they hadn't
I would have had you both.

26:38.670 --> 26:40.456
The whole set.

26:41.540 --> 26:43.610
The matching pair.

26:43.620 --> 26:44.871
Why are you doing this?

26:44.880 --> 26:49.374
Because you asked me to, Cheryl.
You asked me with your glances.

26:49.920 --> 26:53.538
The way you talk, those little gestures.

26:54.420 --> 26:56.820
-What are you doing?
-Do not answer this man.

26:56.830 --> 26:59.287
You asked for this.
You asked for it, Cheryl.

26:59.290 --> 27:00.666
Cher... No!
-What do you want?

27:00.670 --> 27:02.877
What do I want? You!

27:03.120 --> 27:05.418
It may not be today,
it may not be tomorrow,

27:05.420 --> 27:08.241
but I promise you, we will be together.

27:30.120 --> 27:32.076
We can't let Cheryl speak
with him any further.

27:32.080 --> 27:33.206
Why not?

27:33.210 --> 27:36.452
It's only feeding his psychosis
to allow your interaction.

27:37.080 --> 27:39.708
Was Trish involved in any serious
relationships prior to the kidnapping?

27:41.420 --> 27:45.493
With the boy that was killed.
They were together for two years.

27:46.330 --> 27:51.666
Trish didn't want me to tell you.
They were getting engaged.

27:54.960 --> 27:59.988
Well, that certainly could have
been the UnSub's stressor.

28:01.250 --> 28:03.161
What does that mean?

28:04.380 --> 28:07.452
Will someone please tell me
what we're dealing with here?

28:07.460 --> 28:08.916
De Clerambault's syndrome.

28:08.920 --> 28:10.911
Otherwise known as erotomania.

28:10.920 --> 28:13.741
The belief that someone,
usually of a higher social status

28:13.750 --> 28:16.241
but not necessarily a celebrity,
is in love with you.

28:16.250 --> 28:18.571
Erotomanics believe
that the objects of their affection

28:18.580 --> 28:22.573
are subtly professing their love for them
through looks, gestures...

28:22.580 --> 28:24.036
Glances.

28:24.500 --> 28:29.324
He said,
"You asked me with your glances."

28:29.580 --> 28:32.708
The UnSub truly
and full-heartedly believes

28:32.710 --> 28:35.031
that Cheryl and Trish
are in love with him.

28:35.040 --> 28:36.780
They don't tell him this
with their voices.

28:36.790 --> 28:39.702
No, with gestures and looks.

28:39.710 --> 28:42.031
He's obsessed with them.

28:42.040 --> 28:43.917
What does this mean?

28:44.330 --> 28:46.491
He's the most determined kind of criminal.

28:47.960 --> 28:51.111
Crime of obsession,
your specialty. Your lead, Morgan.

28:51.460 --> 28:52.825
I think we should re-check everyone

28:52.830 --> 28:54.786
on Davenport's staff
against the profile of a stalker.

28:54.790 --> 28:56.826
Aren't stalking behaviors pretty diverse?

28:56.830 --> 28:58.036
There's overlap.

28:58.040 --> 28:59.951
Narcissistic,
inflated sense of self-worth,

28:59.960 --> 29:01.245
history of bad relationships.

29:01.250 --> 29:02.956
What do we know so far?

29:03.380 --> 29:05.416
He's probably white. Obviously male.

29:05.420 --> 29:08.787
-Sophisticated speech patterns.
-Sophisticated yet bizarre.

29:08.790 --> 29:13.284
He rarely uses contractions.
It's not "you're," it's "you are."

29:13.290 --> 29:14.450
This guy's pretentious.

29:14.460 --> 29:16.246
He wants to sound smarter
than he actually is.

29:16.250 --> 29:19.322
Whatever position of authority
or level of success this guy has,

29:19.330 --> 29:20.786
he had to struggle for it.

29:20.790 --> 29:22.951
We also have to face
the possibility at this point...

29:22.960 --> 29:24.996
That Trish may already be dead.

29:28.460 --> 29:30.951
You know, so far he's called every play.

29:31.460 --> 29:34.167
I say we apply some pressure.
Make him sweat.

29:35.620 --> 29:38.327
Well, there's only one way to do that.

29:50.210 --> 29:51.996
Hold on. Hold on. Hold on.

30:12.170 --> 30:13.660
What are you doing?

30:20.040 --> 30:21.667
Agent Gideon...

30:27.290 --> 30:28.666
Hello?

30:28.670 --> 30:30.706
Tell me there was
a technical issue with the line,

30:30.710 --> 30:32.917
because if you actually just hung up on...

30:32.920 --> 30:34.205
What the hell are you doing?

30:37.500 --> 30:38.615
Are you gonna answer it?

30:38.620 --> 30:40.076
Why is he doing this?
What is... What...

30:40.080 --> 30:42.457
You're going to drive this guy crazy.
Just answer the phone.

30:42.460 --> 30:44.451
Be quiet. Please, quiet.

30:50.000 --> 30:51.991
-Cheryl, he knows what he's doing.
-Somebody has to answer it!

30:52.000 --> 30:53.536
Just answer the phone, for God's sake.

30:53.540 --> 30:55.110
Don't touch it. Let go.

30:55.120 --> 30:56.917
He knows what he's doing.

31:00.080 --> 31:01.240
Davenport residence.

31:01.250 --> 31:02.490
Are you out of your mind?

31:02.500 --> 31:06.243
You do realize... You do understand
that I'll kill her? Do you...

31:11.460 --> 31:12.666
Thank you.

31:12.670 --> 31:15.070
You're killing my daughter!
Pick up the phone! Pick up the...

31:15.080 --> 31:17.457
-Son of a bitch, pick up the phone!
-Keep him quiet.

31:17.460 --> 31:18.825
Be quiet.

31:18.830 --> 31:20.491
The phone! Answer the phone.
Answer the phone.

31:20.500 --> 31:22.912
Answer the phone, you son...
You'll kill her!

31:22.920 --> 31:25.286
Mr. Davenport, get a hold of yourself.

31:25.290 --> 31:27.246
Quiet him.

31:27.670 --> 31:29.535
Let him go.

31:38.210 --> 31:39.609
She is dead!

31:40.040 --> 31:43.248
You hang up on me again
and I rip her open!

31:43.250 --> 31:45.115
I'm sorry,
you must have the wrong number.

31:46.250 --> 31:47.706
Come on, Gideon.

31:51.830 --> 31:53.411
You killed her.
CHERYL: No.

31:53.420 --> 31:55.160
No, sir.
-Oh, God.

31:55.170 --> 31:58.537
Then what the hell
do you think you're doing?

32:00.080 --> 32:02.492
I'm saving your daughter, Mr. Davenport.

32:05.540 --> 32:06.950
Very good.

32:11.500 --> 32:13.320
Have a little faith.

32:21.580 --> 32:23.707
Put Cheryl on the phone.

32:24.000 --> 32:28.073
No, you're finished talking to Cheryl.

32:28.080 --> 32:30.287
Listen to that tone of authority.

32:30.290 --> 32:32.497
Just like your published work,
Agent Gideon.

32:32.500 --> 32:36.209
Fascinating to hear the same arrogant
quality in your own voice.

32:36.210 --> 32:40.032
You are a bit of a pedant, Jason.
A bit didactic?

32:40.040 --> 32:43.168
Well, that's a very
interesting conclusion.

32:43.170 --> 32:48.619
You sound intelligent and
you certainly sound educated and...

32:50.080 --> 32:52.992
-We both know that's not true.-Oh, I know about all of you.

32:53.000 --> 32:55.662
The ambitious Agent Hotchner.

32:55.670 --> 32:58.571
Do you want to be Director
of the FBI someday, Agent Hotchner?

32:58.580 --> 33:00.662
Would you step on Jason Gideon
to get there?

33:00.670 --> 33:01.876
I think you would.

33:01.880 --> 33:04.201
Post-traumatic stress
IS a very good excuse.

33:04.210 --> 33:07.782
Even your sick, pregnant wife
can't get you to leave your post.

33:07.790 --> 33:10.167
Jason Gideon,
an expert in the criminal psyche,

33:10.170 --> 33:12.536
yet unable to diagnose
the autistic leanings

33:12.540 --> 33:14.371
of the very insecure Dr. Reid.

33:14.380 --> 33:17.452
Well, maybe he can make money
counting cards in Las Vegas.

33:17.460 --> 33:19.280
The lovely Elle was promoted too soon.

33:19.290 --> 33:21.952
She doesn't have what it takes
to make it in the BAU boys' club.

33:21.960 --> 33:25.202
You're no threat to me.
You're no threat to anyone.

33:25.210 --> 33:27.667
And token Derek Morgan
wants to be taken seriously

33:27.670 --> 33:29.661
but he is just a pumped-up side of beef.

33:29.670 --> 33:32.491
I know who you are.
I know how you think.

33:32.500 --> 33:35.708
And I know what to do next.
Do you?

33:39.710 --> 33:41.780
What the hell was that?

33:42.170 --> 33:47.244
Why did he say
that he knows what to do next?

33:48.580 --> 33:50.992
Is he going to hurt my daughter?

33:52.830 --> 33:54.457
He was grandstanding.

33:54.460 --> 33:58.373
You don't know that.
You can't possibly know that.

33:58.380 --> 34:03.408
Mr. Davenport, I have learnt more
in the last five minutes

34:03.420 --> 34:05.911
-than in the last 24 hours.
-Oh, really?

34:05.920 --> 34:08.491
Well, I don't understand.
Why is he focused on you right now?

34:08.500 --> 34:11.572
Because we are interfering
in his relationship with the girls.

34:11.580 --> 34:14.071
Yes, apparently.

34:14.080 --> 34:15.490
He profiled us, Mr. Davenport.

34:15.500 --> 34:18.321
-Why would he do that?
-To show us how smart he is.

34:18.330 --> 34:21.117
Oftentimes, the best profilers
are the UnSubs themselves.

34:21.120 --> 34:24.032
They're the ones that are able to walk
into an arcade full of children

34:24.040 --> 34:26.873
and pinpoint the boy or girl
that can be led out quietly.

34:26.880 --> 34:30.782
But he made a mistake, because
he gave us something he didn't expect.

34:31.380 --> 34:33.245
Which is?

34:36.500 --> 34:38.320
He told us how to find him.

34:43.170 --> 34:45.786
You said you knew how to find him,
that you were gonna save my daughter.

34:45.790 --> 34:47.200
Why don't you get out there
and do something?

34:47.210 --> 34:49.451
What are you standing... Everybody
standing around here looking...

34:49.460 --> 34:51.030
-Mr. Davenport...
-Look, don't condescend to me.

34:51.040 --> 34:52.450
-Don't patronize me.
-Evan. Evan.

34:52.460 --> 34:53.609
Don't condescend to me.

34:53.620 --> 34:55.201
Everybody is doing the best
that they can, come on.

34:55.210 --> 34:57.326
Take a break. Take a break.

35:05.000 --> 35:08.663
For the suspect to know that much
about us, he has to be one of us.

35:08.670 --> 35:11.878
I'm gonna have Garcia do a search
of the New Haven FBI field office.

35:11.880 --> 35:14.781
The guy we're looking for knows
this house, he knows the family.

35:14.790 --> 35:17.202
There are 700 agents in New Haven.

35:20.170 --> 35:22.991
While we're narrowing the list,
Cheryl can't stay here.

35:23.000 --> 35:25.707
If he's one of us,
he has access, weapons,

35:25.710 --> 35:27.450
and you bet he's got a strategy.

35:27.460 --> 35:29.701
-So who can we trust?
-No one.

35:30.580 --> 35:33.037
We need to get Cheryl to a safe house.

35:33.040 --> 35:36.328
And limit the amount of agents
she comes in contact with.

36:05.120 --> 36:06.701
We're in.
AGENT: Copy that.

36:07.080 --> 36:09.378
We'll walk the perimeter.
MORGAN: Yeah.

36:34.040 --> 36:36.326
I'm sorry about before.

36:36.920 --> 36:38.785
It's your daughters. You...

36:40.750 --> 36:43.457
You don't have to apologize for anything.

36:43.460 --> 36:48.909
So, this safe house,

36:49.710 --> 36:51.996
-sure it's okay?
-Of course.

36:54.670 --> 36:59.915
-We have agents inside, out.
-So now we just wait.

37:06.330 --> 37:08.992
They did a bug sweep
right when we arrived.

37:09.000 --> 37:10.160
Yeah, I remember.

37:10.170 --> 37:12.877
And yet the UnSub seems
to know all about us.

37:13.120 --> 37:16.954
Hey, Reid, do you know
what non-local interaction is?

37:29.250 --> 37:30.535
What are you getting at?

37:30.540 --> 37:32.747
How can he be holding Trish prisoner

37:32.750 --> 37:35.492
and still know exactly
what we're talking about?

37:35.500 --> 37:36.615
I know what you're saying.

37:36.620 --> 37:39.168
It seems like he knows what's going on
here the moment that it happens.

37:40.830 --> 37:42.491
There's gotta be a listening device.

37:42.500 --> 37:43.819
They swept the room when we got here.

37:43.830 --> 37:46.822
Yeah. And then they brought in
their own equipment.

37:50.920 --> 37:52.035
Come in.

37:54.710 --> 37:55.995
Cheryl.

38:01.500 --> 38:04.162
It's good to finally get you alone.

38:13.120 --> 38:15.611
Agent Shyer called you by your first name.
You know him that well?

38:15.620 --> 38:17.076
He works out of the New York field office.

38:17.080 --> 38:20.208
I know his father. _
We've met socrally on occasron.

38:20.210 --> 38:22.952
-Has he been here before?
-A few times.

38:35.710 --> 38:37.109
Does it ever annoy you when people

38:37.120 --> 38:39.202
want to line you and Patricia up together

38:39.210 --> 38:41.451
to examine the differences?

38:41.460 --> 38:43.826
Seems like it would get old real fast.

38:47.080 --> 38:48.991
But I don't need to do that.

38:50.880 --> 38:56.876
I've known you both for so long,
loved you for so long.

38:58.920 --> 39:00.911
Please don't do this.

39:08.170 --> 39:10.411
But this is how it should
have been all along.

39:10.420 --> 39:12.160
The three of us, together.

39:12.170 --> 39:13.956
Put the knife down.

39:24.710 --> 39:25.950
You don't understand.

39:25.960 --> 39:28.167
You don't understand my relationship
with these girls.

39:28.170 --> 39:30.536
-Put the knife down.
-You don't understand...

39:30.540 --> 39:32.576
I said put it down!

39:38.250 --> 39:39.239
Okay.

39:51.960 --> 39:54.576
-You okay?
-Yeah.

40:00.040 --> 40:01.996
Where is Patricia?

40:26.880 --> 40:29.576
It's okay.
TRISH: Hey.

40:50.670 --> 40:52.661
It's gonna be okay.

41:01.080 --> 41:02.411
Thank you.

41:13.000 --> 41:16.618
Hey, how did Elle get Shyer
to give us Trish's location?

41:16.620 --> 41:20.033
I imagine she found some creative way
to persuade him.

41:20.040 --> 41:21.416
What do you think...

41:21.420 --> 41:25.072
You know, you know, maybe you just
don't need to ask so many questions.

41:25.080 --> 41:28.493
Just enjoy the moment.

41:32.580 --> 41:35.743
Euripides said,
"When love is in excess,

41:35.750 --> 41:39.322
"it brings a man no honor,
nor worthiness."

41:57.380 --> 41:58.950
You all right?

42:00.960 --> 42:02.496
You took a Taser hit.

42:02.500 --> 42:04.741
Yeah, I know I did. So what?

42:04.750 --> 42:08.117
So no one expects you to finish
the Davenport file tonight.

42:10.080 --> 42:13.288
Yeah, well, I guess it's still
a little fresh in my mind.

42:13.290 --> 42:17.374
Nothing like 50,000 volts in your back
to keep your motor running, right?

42:21.040 --> 42:23.577
You know, Elle, I'm just...

42:24.080 --> 42:27.288
I'm luclq as hell that bastard
didn't gut me while I was unconscious.

42:27.290 --> 42:30.498
-He wasn't interested in you.
-Yeah.

42:32.540 --> 42:35.612
You know, Shyer didn't see you
as a peer or a threat.

42:35.920 --> 42:38.707
-That was his mistake.
-Yes, It was.

42:43.290 --> 42:45.918
You're gonna be here all night.

42:45.920 --> 42:48.377
-Give me half.
-Okay.

42:48.920 --> 42:50.876
Be careful what you wish for.

42:51.710 --> 42:53.530
Knock yourself out.
