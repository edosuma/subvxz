00:01.930 --> 00:03.830
<b>Tonight, at 9 PM,</b>

00:03.830 --> 00:07.360
<b>the mummy of Princess Corco 
will be auctioned off.</b>

00:07.770 --> 00:08.610
<b>Ivlenkov,</b>

00:08.610 --> 00:09.610
<b>Tocino,</b>

00:09.610 --> 00:10.610
<b>and Baise,</b>

00:11.190 --> 00:13.240
<b>you'll handle the bidding.</b>

00:13.660 --> 00:15.680
<b>What about the rest of us?</b>

00:15.680 --> 00:17.150
<b>Basho and Linssen</b>

00:17.150 --> 00:19.240
<b>will cover the rear entrance.</b>

00:19.710 --> 00:23.250
<b>Kurapika and Melody will 
take the front entrance.</b>

00:23.630 --> 00:26.780
<b>Squala and I will guard the lady.</b>

00:27.440 --> 00:28.380
<b>And with that,</b>

00:29.450 --> 00:31.010
<b>the mission begins.</b>

01:51.000 --> 01:56.050
<b>A x Shocking x Tragedy</b>

01:59.490 --> 02:02.600
<b>The Nostrade Family has 
learned that someone</b>

02:02.600 --> 02:05.530
<b>plans to attack the 
underground auction run</b>

02:05.530 --> 02:07.290
<b>by the Mafia community.</b>

02:08.760 --> 02:12.400
<b>Kurapika and the other bodyguards</b>

02:12.400 --> 02:15.400
<b>have begun their assignments.</b>

02:36.350 --> 02:38.230
<b>Everyone's here...</b>

02:38.230 --> 02:40.680
<b>These are mostly Mafia leaders.</b>

02:41.090 --> 02:43.430
<b>We even have some head honchos here.</b>

02:45.300 --> 02:46.220
<b>I'm surprised.</b>

02:46.730 --> 02:47.880
<b>Why?</b>

02:48.240 --> 02:50.190
<b>It's only an auction...</b>

02:50.190 --> 02:52.230
<b>They could send an agent.</b>

02:53.780 --> 02:57.070
<b>Their honor's on the line.</b>

02:57.520 --> 02:58.710
<b>For each winning bid,</b>

02:58.710 --> 03:03.120
<b>five percent goes back into the 
Mafia community as a commission.</b>

03:03.820 --> 03:07.040
<b>Does that act as a bribe?</b>

03:07.040 --> 03:11.010
<b>Like, the more they bid, 
the more they'll receive?</b>

03:11.440 --> 03:12.330
<b>Yeah,</b>

03:12.730 --> 03:17.670
<b>that's how the Mafia flexes 
its financial muscles.</b>

03:18.370 --> 03:22.300
<b>So this is a chance to improve 
their standings.</b>

03:22.730 --> 03:26.470
<b>But some gangs have gone bust</b>

03:26.900 --> 03:29.590
<b>because they overbid.</b>

03:31.280 --> 03:33.300
<b>It's about to start.</b>

03:56.740 --> 03:57.860
<b>Okay...</b>

03:58.430 --> 04:01.510
<b>Welcome, everyone.</b>

04:04.560 --> 04:08.600
<b>So, I'm skipping the formalities.</b>

04:16.050 --> 04:17.310
<b>Die.</b>

04:28.010 --> 04:30.950
<b>My Ambidextrous Automatic Weapons 
Double Machine Gun</b>

04:32.270 --> 04:33.210
<b>Get down!</b>

04:33.960 --> 04:35.180
<b><i>Black Balloons!</i></b>

04:35.180 --> 04:36.580
<b>Guard me.</b>

04:39.230 --> 04:42.210
<b>Thankless Heroes
Eleven Black Children</b>

04:49.060 --> 04:51.810
<b><i>Is he using Nen bullets?!</i></b>

04:52.320 --> 04:54.600
<b><i>That means he's also an Emitter!</i></b>

04:55.230 --> 04:56.690
<b><i>He'll break through my Nen barrier,</i></b>

04:57.300 --> 04:59.940
<b><i>and pierce my body...</i></b>

05:00.710 --> 05:04.240
<b><i>Each bullet packs an incredible punch!</i></b>

05:06.140 --> 05:07.370
<b>Run!</b>

05:07.370 --> 05:08.620
<b>Inform the bossâ€”</b>

05:18.280 --> 05:20.220
<b>Baise, you go ahead...</b>

06:00.510 --> 06:03.080
<b>That was way too fast...</b>

06:03.730 --> 06:06.290
<b>I didn't get to do anything.</b>

06:07.460 --> 06:09.260
<b>All yours, Shizuku.</b>

06:10.840 --> 06:12.640
<b>Let's go, Blinky.</b>

06:17.580 --> 06:20.400
<b><i>Suck up the bodies, blood,</i></b>

06:21.640 --> 06:25.040
<b><i>body parts, and all their possessions.</i></b>

06:25.840 --> 06:26.900
<b><i>Grab the chairs, too.</i></b>

06:41.880 --> 06:45.870
<b>Shizuku's <i>Nen</i> ability is always 
entertaining to watch.</b>

06:45.870 --> 06:46.620
<b>Oh?</b>

06:50.490 --> 06:53.100
<b>Someone's still alive.</b>

06:54.170 --> 06:58.040
<b>Wh-Who are you?</b>

06:59.510 --> 07:00.890
<b>Doesn't matter.</b>

07:00.890 --> 07:03.060
<b>You're all dead...</b>

07:04.200 --> 07:05.860
<b>The community will</b>

07:06.410 --> 07:07.360
<b>destroy you.</b>

07:08.100 --> 07:09.860
<b>Your family!</b>

07:10.520 --> 07:12.990
<b>Torture you... Cut you up.</b>

07:13.990 --> 07:15.760
<b>You'll taste hell!</b>

07:23.580 --> 07:24.880
<b>Family?</b>

07:25.670 --> 07:27.100
<b>What's that?</b>

07:37.540 --> 07:40.140
<b>I'm having difficulty hearing clearly,</b>

07:40.140 --> 07:42.190
<b>but there's a real commotion 
inside the building.</b>

07:42.890 --> 07:44.690
<b>Something must have happened.</b>

07:45.330 --> 07:46.540
<b>Contact the leader!</b>

07:48.340 --> 07:49.530
<b>Got it.</b>

07:49.530 --> 07:51.820
<b>I'll contact Linssen and Basho.</b>

07:52.710 --> 07:54.870
<b>You two head inside!</b>

07:57.520 --> 07:58.330
<b>Wha...</b>

07:59.160 --> 08:00.170
<b>What?</b>

08:00.790 --> 08:02.570
<b>There's no one here.</b>

08:04.530 --> 08:06.720
<b>Where did they go? 
Search the place!</b>

08:06.720 --> 08:08.710
<b>Hey, what happened to 
the merchandise?</b>

08:09.170 --> 08:11.720
<b>Underground... Head underground, now!</b>

08:14.410 --> 08:18.630
<b>It appears that everyone in the 
auction house has disappeared.</b>

08:18.630 --> 08:19.550
<b>What?</b>

08:19.550 --> 08:21.480
<b>The whole place is in an uproar.</b>

08:22.100 --> 08:24.240
<b><i>It's out of control.</i></b>

08:24.750 --> 08:27.500
<b>What about the merchandise?</b>

08:27.500 --> 08:29.980
<b>Melody is heading underground, to the safe.</b>

08:32.790 --> 08:34.990
<b>I-It's empty...</b>

08:35.490 --> 08:38.840
<b>The goods for today's auction 
have been stolen!</b>

08:38.840 --> 08:40.490
<b>Who did this?!</b>

08:40.840 --> 08:41.940
<b>Damn!</b>

08:41.940 --> 08:43.520
<b>Where'd they go?</b>

08:43.520 --> 08:45.250
<b>Split up and search, fool!</b>

08:45.250 --> 08:47.890
<b>Send word to every gang...</b>

08:47.890 --> 08:49.180
<b>Quickly!</b>

08:51.870 --> 08:53.760
<b>Okay, understood.</b>

08:54.400 --> 08:57.260
<b>We'll catch those thieves.</b>

08:58.600 --> 09:00.670
<b>I'll head over.</b>

09:00.670 --> 09:04.350
<b>Rendezvous with Linssen and Basho 
behind the building, in Central Park.</b>

09:05.500 --> 09:06.620
<b>Squala...</b>

09:06.620 --> 09:07.490
<b>Yes?</b>

09:07.490 --> 09:10.450
<b>Just in case, leave five dogs behind.</b>

09:10.450 --> 09:11.030
<b>Right.</b>

09:11.580 --> 09:12.750
<b>Listen up!</b>

09:12.750 --> 09:14.400
<b>Don't take your eyes off the boss!</b>

09:14.990 --> 09:18.060
<b>Don't let anyone in the 
room until we return.</b>

09:18.060 --> 09:19.040
<b>Yes.</b>

09:19.910 --> 09:22.440
<b>All roads are sealed.</b>

09:22.440 --> 09:24.790
<b>The only remaining escape 
route is by air!</b>

09:25.100 --> 09:28.080
<b>If you see any suspicious 
aircraft, contact me.</b>

09:28.080 --> 09:30.540
<b>Make sure not to kill them.</b>

09:30.990 --> 09:33.060
<b>The community has offered 
a substantial reward to</b>

09:33.060 --> 09:35.110
<b>the gang that captures the thieves.</b>

09:35.110 --> 09:38.160
<b>You must take them alive!</b>

09:45.390 --> 09:46.810
<b>There wasn't any merchandise?</b>

09:47.280 --> 09:51.190
<b><i>No, the safe was empty.</i></b>

09:52.020 --> 09:55.170
<b>According to the auctioneer, 
the only one who knew the situation,</b>

09:55.170 --> 10:00.070
<b>everything in the safe had been 
moved a few hours earlier.</b>

10:00.910 --> 10:05.450
<b>Exactly as though they 
expected this to happen.</b>

10:07.530 --> 10:11.090
<b>Don't you find the timing too perfect?</b>

10:12.960 --> 10:15.020
<b>We have a...</b>

10:16.220 --> 10:18.130
<b>Judas among us.</b>

10:22.550 --> 10:25.970
<b>We have a Judas among us.</b>

10:27.230 --> 10:30.230
<b>You're saying that one of us is a traitor?</b>

10:34.010 --> 10:36.580
<b>There are no traitors.</b>

10:38.120 --> 10:41.740
<b>Besides, Judas wasn't a traitor.</b>

10:42.770 --> 10:47.700
<b>It's said that Judas sold Jesus out 
for thirty pieces of silver.</b>

10:48.590 --> 10:50.750
<b>But how much would a traitor ask</b>

10:50.750 --> 10:53.750
<b>from the Mafia?</b>

10:56.910 --> 10:58.680
<b>Consider the merits...</b>

10:59.360 --> 11:02.760
<b>What would the traitor gain 
by selling us to the Mafia?</b>

11:03.500 --> 11:04.510
<b>Money?</b>

11:05.160 --> 11:06.020
<b>Glory?</b>

11:06.780 --> 11:07.520
<b>Prestige?</b>

11:09.770 --> 11:13.170
<b>Do you truly believe</b>

11:13.170 --> 11:15.770
<b>that any of us cares for those things?</b>

11:16.750 --> 11:19.200
<b>It's unlikely...</b>

11:19.940 --> 11:21.220
<b><i>You see?</i></b>

11:21.840 --> 11:24.640
<b><i>Besides, something else 
here doesn't add up.</i></b>

11:24.640 --> 11:25.660
<b>Huh?</b>

11:26.340 --> 11:28.520
<b>Assuming there were a spy,</b>

11:28.520 --> 11:30.910
<b>the response was too tepid.</b>

11:31.420 --> 11:33.440
<b>If they had foreknowledge</b>

11:33.440 --> 11:37.550
<b>that Class-A bounties would 
appear at the auction,</b>

11:38.230 --> 11:41.180
<b>they would have increased security.</b>

11:42.660 --> 11:46.900
<b><i>The auction goers were all 
uninformed and unarmed.</i></b>

11:47.690 --> 11:49.250
<b>That's true.</b>

11:51.320 --> 11:53.190
<b>I believe that someone</b>

11:54.330 --> 11:58.690
<b>provided information 
that wasn't explicit.</b>

11:59.000 --> 12:02.520
<b>However, a Mafia community leader</b>

12:02.520 --> 12:05.320
<b>believed that information.</b>

12:08.370 --> 12:10.400
<b>I don't get it...</b>

12:10.400 --> 12:13.980
<b>Who told who what?</b>

12:15.340 --> 12:16.310
<b>Whatever.</b>

12:16.310 --> 12:18.710
<b>So what do we do?</b>

12:19.650 --> 12:22.270
<b>Did you ask the auctioneer</b>

12:22.270 --> 12:24.560
<b>where the merchandise was moved?</b>

12:24.560 --> 12:26.100
<b><i>Yeah, but</i></b>

12:26.470 --> 12:30.120
<b>he swore on his life that he didn't know.</b>

12:30.120 --> 12:32.600
<b>Feitan tortured him, so he wasn't lying.</b>

12:33.530 --> 12:36.860
<b>He had the worst luck of them all today.</b>

12:37.580 --> 12:41.030
<b><i>Did you get the names of 
anyone who might know?</i></b>

12:41.580 --> 12:42.860
<b>You bet I did.</b>

12:44.280 --> 12:48.660
<b>The auction is run by the 
Mafia community heads,</b>

12:48.660 --> 12:52.830
<b>who lead gangs in each of the 
ten districts around the world.</b>

12:53.330 --> 12:55.370
<b>They're called the Ten Dons.</b>

12:55.830 --> 12:59.390
<b>This is the only time that all 
ten gather in one place,</b>

12:59.390 --> 13:02.380
<b>to discuss business and issue orders.</b>

13:03.280 --> 13:06.150
<b>Their commands are carried 
out by a special force,</b>

13:06.150 --> 13:07.590
<b>the Shadow Beasts.</b>

13:07.590 --> 13:13.500
<b>This squad consists of each 
don's best combatants.</b>

13:14.980 --> 13:16.450
<b>I see, then...</b>

13:16.920 --> 13:21.110
<b>Since the Shadow Beasts weren't 
guarding the auction house,</b>

13:21.440 --> 13:26.110
<b>the Mafia didn't know we were coming.</b>

13:26.910 --> 13:28.650
<b>That makes sense.</b>

13:29.240 --> 13:33.030
<b><i>Then how did they move 
the merchandise?</i></b>

13:33.990 --> 13:35.570
<b>That's right...</b>

13:35.570 --> 13:39.380
<b>I heard that a single Shadow Beasts 
member turned up at the safe.</b>

13:42.840 --> 13:45.860
<b>The twenty-five square-meter 
safe was packed with</b>

13:45.860 --> 13:49.640
<b>items ready to be auctioned off.</b>

13:50.660 --> 13:55.410
<b>The Shadow Beast walked in, then 
walked right back out, empty-handed.</b>

13:55.840 --> 13:58.410
<b>But the safe was emptied.</b>

13:58.410 --> 14:02.070
<b>It was a man in sunglasses, 
calling himself Owl.</b>

14:04.520 --> 14:07.860
<b>He must possess a <i>Nen</i> power 
similar to Shizuku's.</b>

14:08.180 --> 14:09.540
<b><i>Probably.</i></b>

14:09.540 --> 14:10.530
<b>Surely they noticed</b>

14:10.850 --> 14:14.540
<b>after five hundred people disappeared...</b>

14:16.760 --> 14:19.040
<b>That they're facing <i>Nen</i> users.</b>

14:19.430 --> 14:20.990
<b>Can we let loose?</b>

14:21.590 --> 14:22.850
<b><i>Naturally.</i></b>

14:24.710 --> 14:27.400
<b><i>Put on a show for the pursuers.</i></b>

14:28.160 --> 14:31.900
<b><i>That will draw them out.</i></b>

14:33.680 --> 14:35.660
<b>I can't wait...</b>

14:40.900 --> 14:41.860
<b>Up there!</b>

14:41.860 --> 14:43.330
<b>It's them! They're in a hot air balloon!</b>

14:43.330 --> 14:46.250
<b>The balloon is moving toward 
the Gordeau Desert!</b>

14:46.250 --> 14:47.320
<b>We're in pursuit!</b>

14:47.730 --> 14:49.040
<b>Hot air balloon?</b>

14:49.040 --> 14:50.660
<b>Not an airship?</b>

14:50.660 --> 14:53.830
<b>Then what became of the 
hundreds of guests?</b>

14:54.080 --> 14:56.750
<b>It's possible that we aren't dealing</b>

14:56.750 --> 14:59.470
<b>with an ordinary band of armed thugs.</b>

15:00.660 --> 15:02.610
<b>Contact the Ten Dons.</b>

15:02.610 --> 15:06.130
<b>Ask them to immediately 
dispatch the Shadow Beasts!</b>

15:09.770 --> 15:11.990
<b>Hurry, they're headed for 
the Gordeau Desert.</b>

15:11.990 --> 15:12.960
<b>Okay!</b>

15:14.300 --> 15:15.540
<b>Roger that.</b>

15:39.390 --> 15:41.300
<b>Come down here!</b>

15:41.300 --> 15:44.880
<b>We'll even let you decide whether 
you'll be drowned or buried!</b>

15:47.070 --> 15:49.330
<b>There's a whole crowd...</b>

15:49.330 --> 15:51.530
<b>I don't have to suck them up, do I?</b>

15:51.940 --> 15:53.460
<b>No, they don't matter.</b>

15:53.460 --> 15:54.640
<b>Hey!</b>

15:54.640 --> 15:56.950
<b>Stay out of this.</b>

15:56.950 --> 15:59.640
<b>I'll handle it...</b>

16:02.750 --> 16:03.860
<b>Wait!</b>

16:16.160 --> 16:19.330
<b>Are you the ones who 
kidnapped the guests?</b>

16:19.330 --> 16:20.160
<b>Yeah.</b>

16:20.490 --> 16:24.300
<b>Well, you do have guts.</b>

16:24.300 --> 16:26.420
<b>Who's your leader?</b>

16:30.730 --> 16:31.920
<b>Bastard.</b>

17:05.300 --> 17:07.120
<b>His philosophy is</b>

17:07.590 --> 17:09.740
<b>to be the strongest</b>

17:10.060 --> 17:12.000
<b>of them all...</b>

17:13.320 --> 17:18.320
<b>An ordinary gun wouldn't 
even scratch him.</b>

17:18.320 --> 17:20.600
<b>Physically, he's the strongest.</b>

17:21.190 --> 17:24.600
<b>It's like watching a gorilla stomping ants.</b>

17:26.280 --> 17:27.310
<b>Oh?</b>

17:27.310 --> 17:28.360
<b>More of them.</b>

17:28.360 --> 17:32.020
<b>They came all the way here, 
merely to be killed.</b>

17:32.020 --> 17:33.780
<b>Just watching isn't any fun.</b>

17:33.780 --> 17:35.320
<b>Let's play cards.</b>

17:35.320 --> 17:36.210
<b>Yes.</b>

17:36.210 --> 17:37.300
<b>I agree.</b>

17:41.600 --> 17:42.480
<b>Boss!</b>

17:53.430 --> 17:57.410
<b>That wasn't enough to warm me 
up for the Shadow Beasts.</b>

18:07.090 --> 18:09.530
<b>Ow...</b>

18:11.260 --> 18:12.690
<b>A rifle?</b>

18:13.240 --> 18:14.780
<b>How annoying.</b>

18:15.300 --> 18:18.700
<b>Trying to take me out from afar?</b>

18:28.560 --> 18:30.520
<b>Yeah! Bull's-eye!</b>

18:31.100 --> 18:32.590
<b>That's enough!</b>

18:33.800 --> 18:37.800
<b>Don't get too cocky, monster.</b>

18:38.100 --> 18:42.680
<b>This super-bazooka is strong 
enough to take out a tank.</b>

18:43.230 --> 18:45.290
<b>You'll be blown to smithereens!</b>

18:46.450 --> 18:48.010
<b>How sad...</b>

18:48.870 --> 18:52.690
<b>You're comparing me 
to some little tank?</b>

18:52.690 --> 18:54.190
<b>Die!</b>

19:00.180 --> 19:01.870
<b>Did I get him?</b>

19:12.770 --> 19:15.880
<b>That kinda hurt...</b>

19:21.400 --> 19:23.890
<b>None of you will escape!</b>

19:25.520 --> 19:28.390
<b>It appears the enemy can use <i>Nen</i>...</b>

19:28.660 --> 19:30.780
<b>And he's ridiculously strong.</b>

19:36.310 --> 19:38.880
<b>The advance force was obliterated.</b>

19:39.490 --> 19:41.660
<b>Guns are ineffective against him.</b>

19:42.220 --> 19:43.540
<b>Impossible...</b>

19:43.540 --> 19:45.840
<b>See for yourself.</b>

19:45.840 --> 19:48.410
<b>His aura is unbelievable.</b>

19:49.590 --> 19:51.340
<b>As is the number of corpses.</b>

19:54.110 --> 19:57.200
<b>Who is that guy?</b>

19:57.200 --> 20:01.470
<b>He's tearing through people 
like scraps of paper.</b>

20:01.470 --> 20:03.070
<b>We're supposed to capture him?</b>

20:03.070 --> 20:05.260
<b>I won't be part of that!</b>

20:05.260 --> 20:06.650
<b>I agree.</b>

20:06.970 --> 20:09.610
<b>I don't see how we can win...</b>

20:10.720 --> 20:12.100
<b>Indeed.</b>

20:12.900 --> 20:17.730
<b>However, we cannot abandon 
our mission and back off.</b>

20:18.030 --> 20:19.160
<b>But...</b>

20:19.160 --> 20:19.880
<b>Wait.</b>

20:21.320 --> 20:25.950
<b>I suddenly hear an additional 
heartbeat coming from somewhere...</b>

20:41.150 --> 20:43.380
<b>I am Worm, a Shadow Beast.</b>

20:43.660 --> 20:46.890
<b>Which group do you belong to?</b>

20:48.450 --> 20:52.720
<b>We're bodyguards for 
the Nostrade Family.</b>

20:54.000 --> 20:55.400
<b>I see.</b>

20:55.400 --> 20:58.400
<b>It seems that you can use <i>Nen</i>,</b>

20:58.400 --> 20:59.920
<b>but don't bother.</b>

21:00.410 --> 21:03.400
<b>These aren't ordinary thugs.</b>

21:03.400 --> 21:06.660
<b>To them, taking lives is like breathing.</b>

21:06.660 --> 21:10.410
<b>Y-You could say they're 
professional killers.</b>

21:11.160 --> 21:14.610
<b>And a pro knows his trade best of all.</b>

21:17.200 --> 21:18.860
<b>Rabid Dog.</b>

21:18.860 --> 21:20.290
<b>I'm Leech.</b>

21:20.290 --> 21:23.010
<b>I-I'm Porcupine.</b>

21:24.510 --> 21:27.780
<b>We Shadow Beasts will see to them.</b>

21:31.830 --> 21:34.770
<b><i>These are the Shadow Beasts...</i></b>

21:36.120 --> 21:39.190
<b>The Mafia community has 
unleashed the Shadow Beasts</b>

21:39.190 --> 21:42.410
<b>on the bandits who attacked the auction.</b>

21:42.980 --> 21:47.490
<b>Kurapika still has yet to 
realize that they are</b>

21:47.490 --> 21:50.710
<b>facing off against the Phantom Troupe.</b>

23:01.190 --> 23:06.240
<b>Brush Your Teeth. 
Unripe Fruit</b>

23:01.190 --> 23:06.530
<b>Gon and Killua's Hunterpedia</b>

23:01.400 --> 23:02.950
<b>Coming up, we have Gon</b>

<b>Today, we introduce Baise!</b>

23:10.930 --> 23:13.620
<b>A Hunter hired as one 
of Neon's bodyguards.</b>

23:11.500 --> 23:13.380
<b>Her <i>Nen</i> ability is called Instant Lover.</b>

23:13.380 --> 23:15.030
<b>She uses her charms to get close to men,</b>

23:13.620 --> 23:18.830
<b>With <i>Nen</i>, she makes anyone she 
kisses her slave for 180 minutes.</b>

23:15.030 --> 23:16.720
<b>pretend she's into them, and kiss them!</b>

23:16.720 --> 23:18.380
<b>Be careful, you men.</b>

23:25.140 --> 23:27.330
<b>Next time: Buildup x To A x Fierce Battle!</b>

23:27.330 --> 23:30.240
<b>Excuse me, do bananas count as snacks?</b>

23:30.240 --> 23:32.380
<b>Does chocolate count as a snack?</b>

23:32.380 --> 23:34.320
<b>That's always been a snack!</b>
