WEBVTT

00:03.834 --> 00:07.000
Peek-a-boo. I see you.

00:07.500 --> 00:08.375
Teddy: Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:08.458 --> 00:11.083
Oh. Peek-a-boo. I see you.

00:12.208 --> 00:13.375
Yeah.

00:13.500 --> 00:14.583
Ready, ready?

00:14.667 --> 00:17.333
Peek-a-boo! I see you.

00:19.417 --> 00:21.583
I just realized there's
no end to this game.

00:22.834 --> 00:24.041
Amy: Woo-hoo!

00:26.542 --> 00:27.500
Let me guess.

00:27.875 --> 00:29.625
You're gonna be on TV again.

00:29.709 --> 00:31.291
Oh! I can't believe it.

00:31.375 --> 00:33.792
"Good Morning, Denver" called.
They want me to do another segment.

00:33.875 --> 00:35.750
Really? After what happened last time?

00:35.834 --> 00:39.125
Yeah. Turns out, a house falling down
is actually good TV.

00:40.542 --> 00:42.041
Question is, how am I gonna top it?

00:43.166 --> 00:45.083
Okay, Mom. I have some good news too.

00:45.166 --> 00:46.333
Oh really? What's going on?

00:46.500 --> 00:47.875
This is so exciting.

00:47.959 --> 00:50.500
So, you know how Yale
is my first choice of colleges?

00:50.583 --> 00:51.458
Amy: Yeah.

00:51.542 --> 00:54.000
They've scheduled
an alumni interview for me

00:54.083 --> 00:55.875
right here at the house.

00:57.500 --> 00:59.417
I mean, it doesn't mean
that I'm in for sure,

00:59.500 --> 01:01.250
but it definitely means
that they're interested.

01:01.375 --> 01:03.750
And if it goes well,
it's a really big plus.

01:03.834 --> 01:05.083
That's great.

01:06.500 --> 01:08.041
You having trouble focusing?

01:08.125 --> 01:09.750
I'm gonna be on TV.

02:18.875 --> 02:19.709
- Hi.
- Hey.

02:19.792 --> 02:20.667
I'm Lauren.

02:20.750 --> 02:23.041
I'm new to the neighborhood
and I'm looking for babysitting jobs.

02:23.417 --> 02:25.792
And I heard you guys have lots of babies.

02:26.750 --> 02:28.333
Oh, that we do.

02:28.625 --> 02:31.166
But it also means that I have
a lot of free babysitters.

02:31.458 --> 02:32.709
Dad, Dad, Dad.

02:33.125 --> 02:34.875
Shouldn't we keep our options open?

02:36.291 --> 02:38.333
- Hi. I'm Gabe.
- Hi. I'm Lauren.

02:39.250 --> 02:42.542
I probably should interview her just to
make sure she meets our high standards.

02:42.750 --> 02:44.667
Can't just let anybody babysit for, uh...

02:47.333 --> 02:48.959
- Toby?
- Toby, right. Yeah.

02:50.083 --> 02:50.959
Thank you.

02:51.625 --> 02:53.041
So, Lauren,

02:53.667 --> 02:55.000
how long have you been babysitting?

02:55.083 --> 02:56.208
About a year.

02:56.250 --> 02:58.000
Okay. All right.

02:58.083 --> 02:59.375
Follow-up question.

03:00.250 --> 03:01.792
Do you have a boyfriend?

03:03.875 --> 03:05.542
What does that have
to do with babysitting?

03:05.625 --> 03:07.375
Oh, I'm interviewing
for something else now.

03:07.458 --> 03:08.333
Oh.

03:08.750 --> 03:10.792
In that case, I don't have a boyfriend.

03:13.250 --> 03:14.625
Do you have a girlfriend?

03:15.625 --> 03:16.959
I'm working on it.

03:18.792 --> 03:19.875
You're cute.

03:19.959 --> 03:21.083
I am, aren't I?

03:22.208 --> 03:23.917
So, you're new to the neighborhood, huh?

03:24.000 --> 03:26.041
Yeah, I'm staying with my grandmother
for a while.

03:26.125 --> 03:27.375
I can't wait to meet her.

03:28.166 --> 03:29.834
You already have.

03:32.041 --> 03:33.417
Oh no!

03:33.500 --> 03:34.917
Oh yes.

03:35.000 --> 03:37.959
Let's go, Lauren.
This is the one I warned you about.

03:38.083 --> 03:39.667
This is the Devil Child?

03:40.583 --> 03:42.125
But he seems so nice.

03:42.208 --> 03:44.458
That's what makes him the Devil Child.

03:47.709 --> 03:49.542
Hey, people change.

03:56.583 --> 03:58.291
- Oh, hey, PJ.
- Hey, sis.

03:58.709 --> 04:00.959
So, I have a question for you.

04:01.041 --> 04:03.000
Where are you going to be
tomorrow at 3:00 P.M.?

04:03.208 --> 04:04.625
Now, I have an answer for you.

04:04.709 --> 04:05.959
Anywhere but here.

04:06.583 --> 04:07.583
Why can't I be here?

04:08.250 --> 04:12.125
Because a guy is coming over
to interview me for Yale,

04:12.375 --> 04:14.208
and so I want the house to myself.

04:14.583 --> 04:15.834
Because you're ashamed of me?

04:15.917 --> 04:17.125
Not just of you.

04:17.375 --> 04:18.667
Everybody.

04:18.750 --> 04:21.000
Oh. Well, that makes
me feel a little better.

04:22.166 --> 04:23.375
All right.

04:23.458 --> 04:24.709
I guess I can not be here tomorrow.

04:24.792 --> 04:26.083
Great. Thanks.

04:26.166 --> 04:28.500
Oh, although I was gonna watch
my cartoons tomorrow at 3:00.

04:29.750 --> 04:31.166
Can't you just skip a day?

04:31.250 --> 04:32.875
Can't you just skip
your college interview?

04:32.959 --> 04:34.458
Why is your stuff
more important than mine?

04:37.083 --> 04:41.041
Because mine involves Yale, and yours
involves a turtle with a suitcase.

04:42.500 --> 04:45.375
It's a briefcase, and it's a portal
to another dimension.

04:48.000 --> 04:50.375
I'm begging you.
Please don't be here tomorrow.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.208
All right. I'll make other arrangements.

04:54.375 --> 04:55.834
Thank you.

04:58.000 --> 04:59.500
Got an interview for Yale.

05:00.542 --> 05:01.667
Grow up.

05:06.625 --> 05:07.709
Hey.

05:07.792 --> 05:10.000
Hey. What do we have here?

05:10.083 --> 05:11.083
Well,

05:11.166 --> 05:13.792
one of my kids finally wanted
to see where daddy works.

05:15.792 --> 05:16.917
So, Charlie,

05:17.625 --> 05:18.625
what do you think?

05:18.750 --> 05:21.333
Can we go now?

05:21.875 --> 05:23.208
Charlie, we just got here.

05:23.792 --> 05:24.709
Oh.

05:26.333 --> 05:27.792
You wanna sit in daddy's chair?

05:28.083 --> 05:29.000
It spins around.

05:29.083 --> 05:30.709
- Okay.
- Okay.

05:33.250 --> 05:34.750
Boom.

05:34.834 --> 05:36.667
Woo!

05:37.000 --> 05:39.417
- Can I go next, boss?
- We've been over this, Vern.

05:41.000 --> 05:41.959
So...

05:42.333 --> 05:43.667
What have we got lined up for today?

05:44.041 --> 05:45.709
Same as yesterday. Nothing.

05:46.125 --> 05:48.125
What? Man, what...

05:48.709 --> 05:49.959
I don't get it.

05:50.041 --> 05:53.000
Why is business down?
I mean, we just put out new advertising.

05:53.625 --> 05:54.667
Charlie, look.

05:56.041 --> 05:57.041
Huh?

05:58.625 --> 06:01.083
- What do you think?
- That's scary, Daddy.

06:01.959 --> 06:04.291
It's not scary. It's clever.

06:04.834 --> 06:08.667
Oh, you just can't read yet.
You don't realize this is a pun, see?

06:09.041 --> 06:10.875
Daddy's all dressed up like a boxer.

06:11.166 --> 06:13.291
So, I'm gonna knock out your bug problems.

06:13.375 --> 06:15.208
Boxers knock things out.

06:15.750 --> 06:18.000
Oh, that is clever.

06:26.667 --> 06:29.041
- PJ, what you thinking about?
- I've got a problem.

06:29.500 --> 06:31.959
I'm trying to figure out where to watch
my cartoons tomorrow at 3:00.

06:33.583 --> 06:34.625
How about your place?

06:34.709 --> 06:36.750
No, because Emmett's gonna
be watching his cartoons then.

06:38.041 --> 06:38.917
Boy.

06:39.000 --> 06:41.333
You think you have a problem
then you hear something like that.

06:42.834 --> 06:43.959
What's your problem?

06:44.250 --> 06:45.917
Well, I like this girl, but...

06:46.667 --> 06:48.709
Turns out, her grandmother's Mrs. Dabney.

06:48.792 --> 06:51.333
- Ooh. Oh. That is bad.
- Gabe: Yeah.

06:51.417 --> 06:54.583
Normally, I'd have nothing to do
with anyone related to Dabney but,

06:54.667 --> 06:57.834
Lauren has that one quality
I've never really found in a girl before.

06:57.917 --> 06:59.500
- What's that?
- She likes me.

07:00.875 --> 07:02.208
Sounds like one of a kind, man.

07:02.375 --> 07:03.458
You should go for it.

07:03.792 --> 07:05.000
You know what? You're right.

07:05.083 --> 07:06.667
Here goes nothing.

07:08.959 --> 07:10.250
Oh hey, while you're there,

07:10.333 --> 07:11.917
will you find out if Mrs. D
will be watching

07:12.000 --> 07:13.458
"Yacky the Duck" tomorrow at 3:00?

07:27.291 --> 07:28.250
Is Lauren here?

07:28.709 --> 07:29.709
Yes.

07:31.583 --> 07:32.875
Can I see her?

07:33.709 --> 07:34.917
About what?

07:35.458 --> 07:37.083
That's between me and her.

07:37.166 --> 07:40.000
Right now what's between
you and her is me.

07:40.375 --> 07:41.750
So, start talking.

07:43.375 --> 07:44.333
Hi, Gabe.

07:44.542 --> 07:45.417
Hey, Lauren. Uh..

07:45.500 --> 07:47.208
Do you wanna go roller skating tomorrow?

07:47.583 --> 07:48.792
Can I, grandma?

07:49.083 --> 07:51.250
And now it's back to me.

07:53.583 --> 07:54.792
Pretty please?

07:57.458 --> 07:58.458
Oh, all right.

07:58.875 --> 08:00.125
- Thanks.
- Yes.

08:00.667 --> 08:02.500
What time will you be picking us up?

08:04.417 --> 08:05.250
Us?

08:05.667 --> 08:08.291
Well, I'm not gonna let you two
go unchaperoned.

08:08.375 --> 08:10.500
You date her, you date me.

08:13.458 --> 08:14.333
Fine.

08:14.417 --> 08:16.333
I'll be by tomorrow around 1:00.

08:16.875 --> 08:19.041
Will you be taking us
out for cheeseburgers?

08:21.041 --> 08:22.125
Don't push it.

08:22.834 --> 08:24.166
Wear something cute.

08:31.875 --> 08:34.166
- Good morning, Vern.
- Look what I found.

08:34.709 --> 08:36.166
Bob: Oh!

08:37.208 --> 08:38.250
The old me.

08:39.000 --> 08:41.834
Big boy Bob, as the guys
in the break room used to say.

08:43.375 --> 08:46.041
The only guys in the break
room are you and me, Vern.

08:48.166 --> 08:49.542
I guess I said it to myself.

08:52.458 --> 08:53.667
Why is he here?

08:53.750 --> 08:54.625
Well,

08:54.709 --> 08:55.750
I've been thinking.

08:56.500 --> 08:59.834
We used to get a lot of jobs when this guy
was the face of the company.

09:00.375 --> 09:01.458
But then...

09:03.458 --> 09:04.709
This guy came along.

09:05.125 --> 09:06.417
And as your little girl said,

09:06.875 --> 09:08.041
he's scary.

09:09.166 --> 09:11.041
He's also in shape.

09:11.500 --> 09:14.583
I think the new Bob
is frightening the customers.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.875
This guy you want in your house.

09:18.458 --> 09:20.333
He's warm, he's cuddly,

09:20.417 --> 09:21.834
he's gonna eat some cookies... You know,

09:21.917 --> 09:23.333
maybe take a nap on your couch.

09:23.417 --> 09:25.125
I only did that once.

09:26.875 --> 09:27.959
But this guy...

09:28.458 --> 09:30.709
He's tough, he's menacing,

09:30.792 --> 09:32.500
he's gonna kill the bugs, but then what?

09:33.208 --> 09:35.500
Now, he's got a taste for blood.

09:36.166 --> 09:38.625
Oh, that's ridic... What...

09:38.709 --> 09:39.959
What are you saying, Vern?

09:40.041 --> 09:41.417
You want me to put the weight back on?

09:41.500 --> 09:43.834
Oh, no, no. Of course not.

09:44.333 --> 09:46.625
Nobody's saying anything like that.

09:46.709 --> 09:47.750
No, no.

09:48.375 --> 09:49.792
Oh, lookie here.

09:51.250 --> 09:53.250
An ad for an all-you-can-eat buffet...

09:54.000 --> 09:55.792
and us with nothing to do.

10:03.709 --> 10:04.709
Okay.

10:09.375 --> 10:12.041
Hello. I'm Lionel Van Ness. Yale '85.

10:12.125 --> 10:14.000
Hi. I'm Teddy Duncan.

10:14.291 --> 10:15.291
Yale '18.

10:15.792 --> 10:16.959
If all goes well.

10:20.417 --> 10:21.583
Can we start over?

10:23.417 --> 10:24.500
Hello.

10:24.583 --> 10:26.500
I'm Lionel Van Ness. Yale '85.

10:29.792 --> 10:31.458
Please, make yourself comfortable.

10:32.041 --> 10:35.125
Listen. I know these interviews
can be intimidating,

10:35.208 --> 10:38.000
but I just want you to relax, be yourself.

10:38.083 --> 10:39.333
We're just two people talking.

10:39.917 --> 10:41.083
Sounds good to me.

10:41.583 --> 10:42.709
So, Teddy...

10:44.000 --> 10:45.458
What made you think about Yale?

10:45.542 --> 10:48.583
Oh well, there are so many reasons.

10:48.667 --> 10:49.542
But

10:49.625 --> 10:51.041
if I had to pick one,

10:51.542 --> 10:53.000
I guess I'd say I, uh...

10:53.291 --> 10:54.583
have a thing for bulldogs.

11:00.875 --> 11:02.041
It's the mascot.

11:05.000 --> 11:06.166
Oh, hi.

11:06.625 --> 11:08.125
What's going on here?

11:08.208 --> 11:09.834
I told you. My college interview.

11:09.917 --> 11:12.375
Oh, right. I'm sorry.

11:12.375 --> 11:14.166
I'm Amy Duncan. Teddy's mom.

11:14.250 --> 11:16.166
Uh, Lionel Van Ness.

11:16.333 --> 11:17.750
Nice to meet you.

11:20.166 --> 11:22.250
Uh, mom, what are you doing?

11:22.375 --> 11:23.542
I'm sitting in.

11:24.125 --> 11:25.875
You won't even know that I'm here.

11:27.458 --> 11:29.083
That's all right with you,
isn't it, Lionel?

11:29.166 --> 11:31.875
Well, it's a bit unusual,
but I guess it's okay.

11:31.959 --> 11:32.959
Great.

11:33.041 --> 11:34.542
Come on in, boys.

11:36.250 --> 11:37.333
What is going on?

11:37.417 --> 11:40.166
Okay. Let's go back to where you greet
each other like you never met, okay?

11:40.250 --> 11:41.625
And with good energy.

11:50.250 --> 11:51.792
What is all this?

11:51.875 --> 11:54.250
Oh, I'm sorry, Lionel.
Allow me to explain.

11:54.750 --> 11:56.750
I'm a local TV personality.

11:56.834 --> 12:00.083
And I'm filming a segment for my show
"Good Morning, Denver".

12:00.375 --> 12:02.083
And you two are gonna be on it.

12:02.875 --> 12:04.125
No, we're not.

12:05.792 --> 12:07.417
My sweet Teddy.

12:07.500 --> 12:10.000
She's so beautiful,
it's hard to believe she's camera shy.

12:11.083 --> 12:14.000
Mom, could I have a quick word
with you in the kitchen?

12:14.083 --> 12:17.625
Sure, Sweetie. Yes. Be right back.

12:17.709 --> 12:20.000
Hey Ken, could you get him
into a different shirt?

12:20.208 --> 12:21.500
One that goes with my eyes?

12:26.917 --> 12:29.959
- What are you doing?
- I'm killing two birds with one stone.

12:31.291 --> 12:34.959
Teddy, I need a new segment for my show,
and you need help getting into Yale.

12:35.375 --> 12:36.875
Mom, how is this helping?

12:37.166 --> 12:39.667
Having your interview on TV
is gonna make you stand out.

12:39.750 --> 12:42.959
And if I happen to win
a local Emmy as well,

12:43.250 --> 12:45.000
- well, it's a win-win.
- Teddy: Okay...

12:45.917 --> 12:49.500
Mom, this is really important to
me, so just please don't blow it.

12:49.583 --> 12:52.291
I'm not gonna blow it, okay?
I just need five minutes.

12:52.375 --> 12:55.875
I'll get a couple of quick
shots and I'll be on my way.

12:55.959 --> 12:57.792
Five minutes, but that's it.

12:57.875 --> 12:59.375
Thank you, honey. Whoa whoa, whoa.

12:59.458 --> 13:00.750
One more thing.

13:00.834 --> 13:04.000
If you could find some time
to mention the phrase um...

13:04.083 --> 13:06.291
"Rick's Diner, quality you can taste"
that would be...

13:06.375 --> 13:07.750
Too much? Okay, go ahead.

13:14.166 --> 13:16.250
So. We having fun yet?

13:17.333 --> 13:18.083
No.

13:18.166 --> 13:19.125
Good.

13:20.917 --> 13:22.208
Oh, hey, guys.

13:22.583 --> 13:25.667
PJ! What the heck are you doing here?

13:26.083 --> 13:28.333
At the roller rink, unexpectedly.

13:30.000 --> 13:31.250
Oh, hello, Gabe.

13:31.542 --> 13:33.166
I just came by to roller skate.

13:33.709 --> 13:35.333
As I often do this time of day.

13:35.792 --> 13:37.208
As long as you're here,

13:37.291 --> 13:40.250
you can chaperone us,
and Mrs. Dabney can go home.

13:41.750 --> 13:44.959
Do you really think I'd leave
my granddaughter with Devil Child

13:45.041 --> 13:47.583
and Devil Child's dimwitted brother?

13:47.667 --> 13:49.583
Don't worry, Mrs. Dabney.
Gabe and I will be here too.

13:49.667 --> 13:50.542
Oh!

13:55.875 --> 13:57.041
Okay, new plan.

13:57.125 --> 13:59.625
You keep Dabney occupied so I can get
some alone time with Lauren.

13:59.709 --> 14:01.166
- Alright you got it little bro.
- Thanks.

14:01.250 --> 14:02.959
I will not let Mrs. Dabney
out of my sight.

14:05.250 --> 14:06.250
I lost her.

14:10.667 --> 14:12.375
- This is nice, huh?
- Yeah.

14:14.834 --> 14:16.166
Oh,

14:16.250 --> 14:17.875
I think it's a couples' skate.

14:18.125 --> 14:19.750
So, I think we're supposed to hold hands.

14:20.542 --> 14:22.667
Well, if we have to.

14:24.208 --> 14:25.458
If we have to.

14:30.750 --> 14:32.083
Oh, no, you don't.

14:34.041 --> 14:36.000
And now it's triple skate.

14:38.709 --> 14:39.625
Found her.

14:46.583 --> 14:49.041
Also, I've always been
interested in writing,

14:49.166 --> 14:53.166
and I know that Yale has
a great English Department which, um...

14:53.667 --> 14:55.750
Is actually what drew me there
in the first place.

14:56.166 --> 14:58.000
You know, I've considered a career in...

14:58.250 --> 15:00.917
in journalism and possibly...

15:02.250 --> 15:03.750
...teaching. You're breathing on my neck.

15:04.917 --> 15:06.834
Honey, it's for the camera.
It's called a two-shot.

15:06.917 --> 15:07.959
Are you getting this, Ken?

15:09.750 --> 15:11.625
What would you consider
your greatest challenge?

15:11.709 --> 15:13.041
Oh, you mean...

15:13.125 --> 15:14.166
besides this?

15:14.250 --> 15:15.583
Uh...

15:15.667 --> 15:18.250
I have to say choosing the right major.

15:19.083 --> 15:21.000
Because I have so many
different interests.

15:21.083 --> 15:23.125
- It's gonna--
- You know, if I may, Lionel.

15:23.250 --> 15:25.333
I think what Teddy's trying
to say is that,

15:25.417 --> 15:30.000
she has been drawn to Yale because she
wants to follow in her mother's footsteps.

15:30.083 --> 15:31.208
Oh, did you go to Yale?

15:32.792 --> 15:33.917
I thought about it.

15:34.709 --> 15:37.458
But then I chose Southwest Denver
Community College.

15:37.917 --> 15:39.500
The jewel of The Rockies.

15:40.917 --> 15:43.041
You know, Yale's just been
done to death, so.

15:43.834 --> 15:45.875
Getting back to Teddy uh,

15:46.250 --> 15:47.667
tell me about your extracurriculars.

15:48.250 --> 15:51.333
Uh, well, I've always
had a passion for theater.

15:52.125 --> 15:53.417
- It's--
- I have a question.

15:53.500 --> 15:55.125
You're gonna wanna go tight on this, Ken.

15:57.000 --> 15:58.333
As a concerned mother,

15:58.417 --> 16:00.458
I wanna know about your meal plan.

16:01.458 --> 16:04.375
I am not gonna send my daughter
all the way across the country

16:04.375 --> 16:06.041
if she doesn't have
balanced nutrition and...

16:07.667 --> 16:11.875
I'm sorry. I can do so much better.
Let's just do that again.

16:11.959 --> 16:14.333
- As a concerned--
- Stop it!

16:14.417 --> 16:15.250
What?

16:15.375 --> 16:16.625
Your five minutes are up.

16:16.709 --> 16:17.792
You're done.

16:18.083 --> 16:19.959
- Teddy, I'm just trying to help.
- Who?

16:20.667 --> 16:21.792
Who are you helping?

16:22.166 --> 16:23.500
Because it's not me.

16:27.041 --> 16:28.750
Guys, could you turn the camera off?

16:28.834 --> 16:29.959
Just take five.

16:33.667 --> 16:35.000
I did it again, didn't I?

16:35.959 --> 16:38.500
I'm sorry, Teddy. I'm so, so sorry.

16:38.583 --> 16:43.000
I just... sometimes I wanna be
on TV so bad that I lose my head.

16:43.333 --> 16:45.458
Yeah, well, it's over.

16:45.542 --> 16:47.542
So, Mr. Van Ness, I'm...

16:48.125 --> 16:50.083
Very sorry that we wasted your time.

16:50.166 --> 16:52.542
I know this thing has
been a complete disaster,

16:52.625 --> 16:53.750
and I'm never going to Yale.

16:53.834 --> 16:56.250
Actually, I'm very impressed with you.

16:58.041 --> 17:00.166
Your grades are excellent,
you're well-rounded,

17:00.458 --> 17:02.375
and now that I know
you've accomplished everything...

17:02.792 --> 17:05.041
under such difficult circumstances...

17:06.750 --> 17:08.000
I'm gonna recommend you.

17:08.375 --> 17:09.542
Really?

17:10.500 --> 17:11.917
Well, that's amazing!

17:14.959 --> 17:15.959
You're welcome!

17:24.834 --> 17:26.000
What's going on, boss?

17:26.083 --> 17:27.500
We're doing a photo shoot, Vern.

17:27.583 --> 17:29.458
Oh, we're finally gonna do that calendar?

17:29.542 --> 17:31.583
"The men of Bob's Bugs Be Gone".

17:32.250 --> 17:33.667
Dibs on Baby New Year.

17:34.875 --> 17:37.667
Yeah, I'm gonna need a minute
to get that image out of my head.

17:38.834 --> 17:40.834
No, I... I was thinking
about what you said.

17:41.500 --> 17:43.291
About how the customers think I'm scary.

17:43.667 --> 17:44.625
Oh, what about it?

17:45.208 --> 17:46.417
Maybe you're right.

17:46.500 --> 17:48.166
So, you know what? We should do new shots.

17:48.750 --> 17:50.375
Make me look friendly and lovable,

17:50.458 --> 17:52.667
so that people will want me
in their house killing things.

17:52.750 --> 17:54.291
Brilliant. Let's do it.

17:54.375 --> 17:56.709
♪ S-s-super star. ♪

17:56.959 --> 17:59.542
♪ Big star going far, there you are. ♪

17:59.625 --> 18:01.667
♪ S-s-super star. ♪

18:01.750 --> 18:03.208
♪ S-s-super star. ♪

18:03.291 --> 18:04.542
♪ Yeah, come on. ♪

18:04.625 --> 18:07.166
♪ Look so bright. Livin' right.
Here all night. ♪

18:07.250 --> 18:08.542
♪ Come on. S-s-superstar. ♪

18:08.625 --> 18:09.834
This isn't working, is it?

18:10.917 --> 18:12.250
Too bad you don't have a puppy.

18:12.333 --> 18:14.125
Nobody can resist those little guys.

18:14.500 --> 18:17.500
Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute.
I got something even better.

18:20.917 --> 18:22.834
Now, we're talking, boss.

18:23.500 --> 18:25.166
Hey, I even have a new slogan.

18:25.250 --> 18:27.542
"I'll protect your house
just like it's my own baby".

18:28.000 --> 18:29.542
- Love it.
- So...

18:30.041 --> 18:31.417
how do I look?

18:31.500 --> 18:34.542
- Getting my smile okay?
- Vern: I'm getting everything I need.

18:43.834 --> 18:45.709
Oh, wow.

18:45.750 --> 18:48.333
I forgot how much fun dating can be.

18:48.542 --> 18:51.000
If you ask us out again,
we'll probably say yes.

18:53.750 --> 18:54.875
All right, Mrs. Dabney,

18:54.959 --> 18:56.208
let's see what you got.

18:56.250 --> 18:58.625
Oh no. I gotta keep my eye on these two.

18:58.917 --> 19:00.166
Oh, I get it.

19:00.250 --> 19:01.542
You don't got any moves.

19:01.625 --> 19:03.625
Oh, it's gonna be like that, huh?

19:03.917 --> 19:05.083
All right.

19:05.166 --> 19:07.417
You two, hands to yourself.

19:07.500 --> 19:09.250
I gotta take PJ to school.

19:12.333 --> 19:13.458
- Let's go.
- Okay.

19:24.542 --> 19:26.917
Wow, Mrs. Dabney, you move
pretty well for an old...

19:28.041 --> 19:30.083
school skater.

19:30.959 --> 19:32.208
Why did you pause?

19:32.458 --> 19:33.583
I...

19:34.000 --> 19:35.041
sometimes do that.

19:49.041 --> 19:51.083
You know, I was once
in an ice skating contest

19:51.166 --> 19:53.834
where I picked Gabe up
and twirled him over my head.

19:53.917 --> 19:55.166
Not gonna happen.

19:55.250 --> 19:59.166
Oh, neither I nor the Laws of Gravity
were suggesting it.

19:59.250 --> 20:01.709
Sometimes you're smart,
sometimes you're dumb.

20:01.834 --> 20:02.917
It's hard to keep up.

20:08.166 --> 20:11.333
I just want you to know that no matter
what your grandmother says,

20:11.375 --> 20:13.458
I'm not a bad guy.

20:13.542 --> 20:14.709
Maybe I like bad guys.

20:16.542 --> 20:19.208
Oh, my god.

20:25.083 --> 20:27.709
- Ready to kick it up a notch?
- Try and stop me!

20:31.375 --> 20:32.542
Woo!

20:32.625 --> 20:34.625
Woo-ooh!

20:34.709 --> 20:36.625
No!

20:42.083 --> 20:43.417
Hey, Charlie. So...

20:44.125 --> 20:45.333
piece of advice.

20:45.542 --> 20:48.583
When it's time for your college
interviews, just go to them.

20:48.667 --> 20:51.583
Don't let them come to you.

20:51.667 --> 20:54.750
You know what?
Actually, this applies to everything.

20:54.834 --> 20:57.959
Playdates, sleepovers, first dates.

20:59.250 --> 21:01.250
Basically any social interaction.

21:02.458 --> 21:04.959
Can you do that somewhere else?
I'm hurting over here.

21:05.709 --> 21:07.667
Gabe's a little cranky.

21:07.750 --> 21:09.583
He went on a date and had a little mishap.

21:10.625 --> 21:11.625
A mishap?

21:12.208 --> 21:14.917
I went looking for love
and got a face full of Dabney.

21:18.792 --> 21:20.125
Wish him good luck, Charlie.

21:24.417 --> 21:25.750
Peek-a-boo. I see you.

21:28.583 --> 21:30.750
Peek-a-boo! I see you.

21:30.834 --> 21:32.917
Toby: Man, I'm so sick of this game.

21:33.166 --> 21:34.750
And this guy seems to love it.

21:36.041 --> 21:37.542
Peek-a-boo. I see you.

21:37.917 --> 21:40.000
Toby: Oh, there's a new twist...

21:40.500 --> 21:41.375
Not.

21:41.458 --> 21:43.625
Peek-a-boo! I see you.

21:43.750 --> 21:45.083
Toby: Anything but this.

21:45.709 --> 21:48.542
Toby: "Wheels on the bus"?
"Itsy bitsy spider"? Something?

21:49.917 --> 21:51.625
Peek-a-boo. I see you.

21:51.709 --> 21:53.166
Toby: Check, please!

21:54.834 --> 21:55.834
Ooh.

21:56.333 --> 21:57.291
Three o'clock.

21:57.750 --> 21:59.458
Time for "Yacky the Duck".

22:01.333 --> 22:02.959
Toby: Oh, thank goodness.

22:04.333 --> 22:06.166
Oh, I've seen this one already.

22:07.208 --> 22:09.792
Toby: Huh? No, no, no.
It's worth another look.

22:10.083 --> 22:11.834
There's nuance, subtlety, there's...

22:11.917 --> 22:13.625
Peek-a-boo. I see you.

22:13.959 --> 22:15.834
Toby: Huh? Aah!
