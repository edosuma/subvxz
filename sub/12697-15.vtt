00:09.509 --> 00:11.144
{\an8}Hey, what's that?

00:11.211 --> 00:12.412
Lunch.

00:14.547 --> 00:15.982
Low fat cheese in a can?

00:16.049 --> 00:17.951
This is what your mom
gave you for lunch?

00:18.017 --> 00:20.086
{\an8}Hey, I'm just happy
she woke up before noon.

00:22.088 --> 00:25.859
Hello, ladies, or should I say,
"Lady and Sam?"

00:35.502 --> 00:36.669
Hey.

00:36.736 --> 00:37.937
{\an8}You can have this back
when you learn

00:38.004 --> 00:39.973
{\an8}to handle Squirtable
cheese responsibly.

00:45.512 --> 00:46.713
Hi, Lisa.

00:48.848 --> 00:51.084
Hi, Freddie.

00:51.151 --> 00:53.319
-Who's that?
-Ms. Gatlin.

00:53.386 --> 00:55.922
She told our class that if
everybody got a's on our quiz,

00:55.989 --> 00:57.123
She'd dress up like a chicken

00:57.190 --> 01:00.760
for the whole day
Impressive costume.

01:00.827 --> 01:02.228
Yeah, that's the best
Ms. Gatlin's looked

01:02.295 --> 01:04.464
in three years.

01:04.531 --> 01:06.900
Hey, Freddie, thanks for
letting me borrow your notes.

01:06.966 --> 01:09.035
Hey, anything to get
a teacher in a chicken suit.

01:09.102 --> 01:10.603
Yeah, what's better than that?

01:10.670 --> 01:12.906
Maybe a chicken
in a teacher suit.

01:12.972 --> 01:14.974
Awesome, he'd be all...

01:15.842 --> 01:18.044
Do your homework.

01:19.712 --> 01:22.348
You make funny chicken noises.

01:22.415 --> 01:24.617
Thanks. All right.

01:24.684 --> 01:26.619
Well, I gotta go give
a nerd a wedgie.

01:26.686 --> 01:29.389
Late.

01:29.456 --> 01:30.857
Hey, who is he?

01:30.924 --> 01:32.759
Jonah.
A guy in my French class.

01:32.826 --> 01:35.929
-Freddie, go to your locker.
-Why?

01:35.995 --> 01:37.363
-I don't need to go...
-Go to your locker.

01:37.430 --> 01:40.867
Okay. Okay. Okay.

01:42.602 --> 01:43.970
You love Jonah.

01:44.037 --> 01:46.005
Kinda, he's so cool.

01:46.072 --> 01:47.474
Then you should ask him
to hang out.

01:47.540 --> 01:49.375
Nah, a guy like that
won't wanna hang out with me.

01:49.442 --> 01:50.844
Why not?

01:50.910 --> 01:52.612
He makes chicken noises
and bothers other children.

01:52.679 --> 01:54.614
He's perfect for you.

01:54.681 --> 01:56.216
Forget it.

01:56.282 --> 01:58.885
I gotta go squirt cheese down
Gibby's pants before class.

02:00.253 --> 02:02.689
Hey, Gibby,
don't you run, Gibby.

02:02.755 --> 02:05.158
Gibby.

02:05.225 --> 02:07.026
-Open your mouth.
-I can't do that.

02:09.662 --> 02:12.332
Come on, Gibby...

02:12.398 --> 02:14.467
Freddie, do you believe
in love at first sight?

02:14.534 --> 02:17.203
Yes, I do. I always did.

02:17.270 --> 02:19.906
I mean Sam likes
your friend, Jonah.

02:19.973 --> 02:22.675
Oh. Tell Jonah to ask Sam out.

02:22.742 --> 02:23.943
No.

02:24.010 --> 02:26.212
Jonah never did
anything bad to me.

02:26.279 --> 02:29.048
Come on.
Sam doesn't like many guys.

02:29.115 --> 02:31.017
-No.
-Please, for me?

02:31.084 --> 02:32.952
-Don't do that.
-What?

02:33.019 --> 02:34.821
You think whenever you say,
"Please, for me?"

02:34.888 --> 02:36.756
That I'll just do anything
you want.

02:36.823 --> 02:39.158
-Well, not this time.
-Please, for me?

02:39.225 --> 02:41.027
Okay.

02:41.094 --> 02:45.064

-Hey, Jonah.
-Hey, what's up?

03:54.033 --> 03:55.969
You remember that
girl that was with me

03:56.035 --> 03:57.303
when you gave me back my notes?

03:57.370 --> 03:59.372
Yeah, she seems cool.
Cute too.

04:01.107 --> 04:03.710
I'm talkin'
about the blonde one.

04:03.776 --> 04:05.812
Yeah, I know.
Her name's Sam, right?

04:05.878 --> 04:07.614
Right.

04:07.680 --> 04:11.718
So, I hear
she kind of likes you.

04:11.784 --> 04:14.320
Does she?

04:14.387 --> 04:16.656
-Tell me about her.
-Sure.

04:16.723 --> 04:23.062
Well, she's got
really great teeth.

04:24.397 --> 04:26.132
That's great,
but what's she like?

04:26.199 --> 04:31.971
Well, she's, like,

04:32.038 --> 04:35.308
she's really nice, cool,

04:35.375 --> 04:37.543
and pleasant to be around.

04:37.610 --> 04:39.112
Man, are you okay?
You look kind of sick.

04:39.178 --> 04:41.948
Yeah.

04:42.015 --> 04:45.485
So, why don't you ask Sam out?

04:45.551 --> 04:48.254
Okay, I will.
Thanks for hooking me up.

04:48.321 --> 04:51.591
I'm talkin' about
the blonde one.

04:51.658 --> 04:53.493
Yeah.

04:53.559 --> 04:55.495
Okay.

05:00.066 --> 05:01.401
All right, little buddy.

05:01.467 --> 05:03.803
Now, I know you don't want
a fat neck, do you?

05:06.072 --> 05:08.641
No, of course you don't.

05:08.708 --> 05:13.713
I'll just mold it down a little
and it'll be nice and slender.

05:13.780 --> 05:15.381
Okay, okay. I know.

05:15.448 --> 05:16.649
He probably had a fever

05:16.716 --> 05:18.151
and didn't know
what he was saying.

05:18.217 --> 05:20.953
Will you stop and just be happy
that Jonah asked you out?

05:21.020 --> 05:21.888
But why would he ask me out?

05:21.954 --> 05:22.922
Why wouldn't he?

05:22.989 --> 05:26.259
Well, you know.

05:26.325 --> 05:29.896
Some boys find me
kind of abrasive.

05:31.597 --> 05:33.066
No.

05:33.132 --> 05:35.201
It's true.

05:35.268 --> 05:36.169
-Hi.
-Hey.

05:36.235 --> 05:39.605
Oh.

05:39.672 --> 05:42.675
You made me slice the head
off my space hamster.

05:42.742 --> 05:43.710
Space hamster?

05:43.776 --> 05:44.877
I thought
our government cancelled

05:44.944 --> 05:46.412
the Space Hamster Program.

05:46.479 --> 05:48.881
That's a clay hamster.

05:48.948 --> 05:52.452
Clay space hamster, which
I'm sculpting for my movie.

05:52.518 --> 05:54.387
-You're making a movie?
-Yeah.

05:54.454 --> 05:56.689
The Seattle arts council
is having a short film contest,

05:56.756 --> 05:58.958
so I'm using
my sculpting skills

05:59.025 --> 06:00.326
to do a little claymation.

06:00.393 --> 06:02.028
What's claymation?

06:02.095 --> 06:05.198
See, if I were made of clay
and you take a video camera

06:05.264 --> 06:07.166
and shot one frame
of me like this,

06:07.233 --> 06:08.868
and one frame like this,

06:08.935 --> 06:11.771
and then one like this,
then one like this,

06:11.838 --> 06:13.039
and then one like this,

06:13.106 --> 06:14.107
and then you played it
all back,

06:14.173 --> 06:15.374
it'd look like this.

06:18.511 --> 06:19.746
So, what's your movie about?

06:19.812 --> 06:21.647
Well, it's about an alien
with five arms

06:21.714 --> 06:23.316
that buddies up
with a space hamster,

06:23.382 --> 06:24.350
and they travel
across the universe

06:24.417 --> 06:27.620
in search
of the ultimate burrito.

06:29.021 --> 06:30.256
Oh, it's Jonah. Shh.

06:30.323 --> 06:32.759
I wasn't even talking.

06:32.825 --> 06:34.861
What's up?

06:34.927 --> 06:36.929
Sure, cool.

06:36.996 --> 06:38.498
He wants to take me
to a movie tonight.

06:38.564 --> 06:40.099
You said you had
a ton of homework.

06:40.166 --> 06:41.567
I didn't say I was gonna do it.

06:46.506 --> 06:48.608
Hey, how was French class?

06:48.674 --> 06:49.776
Terrible.

06:50.910 --> 06:52.879
I got a b plus on a test.

06:52.945 --> 06:54.547
A b plus?

06:54.614 --> 06:57.550
That's not part of the
Freddie Benson master plan.

06:57.617 --> 07:00.686
Yeah, well,
'cause Jonah was sitting

07:00.753 --> 07:03.222
right next to me Text messaging
Sam the whole time.

07:03.289 --> 07:04.524
You know, they spent, like,

07:04.590 --> 07:06.626
every second together
for the past three days?

07:06.692 --> 07:08.194
Yeah, they're like
a total couple.

07:08.261 --> 07:10.263
I know. It's disgusting.

07:10.329 --> 07:13.800
It's not disgusting.
It's nice.

07:13.866 --> 07:15.201
Hey, we were
just talking about you.

07:15.268 --> 07:17.503
Oh, wait, wait, wait.
Shh, Jonah just texted me.

07:19.572 --> 07:21.641
The back of your head
is totally cute.

07:21.707 --> 07:24.811
Aw, he's thinking about
the back of my head.

07:24.877 --> 07:27.180
Not just thinking about it.
I'm looking at it.

07:27.246 --> 07:29.415
Hey, I missed you.

07:29.482 --> 07:31.284
-I missed you too.
-Want to go get some lunch?

07:31.350 --> 07:33.786
Sure, as long as you promise
not to sniff the fruit salad.

07:37.523 --> 07:38.858
Sniff the fruit salad?

07:38.925 --> 07:40.459
We were at the
Groovy Smoothie yesterday.

07:40.526 --> 07:41.994
We saw this dude.

07:42.061 --> 07:43.229
Oh, you had to be there.

07:43.296 --> 07:44.831
-Come on, let's go.
-Okay.

07:44.897 --> 07:46.032
-The fruit.
-And we sniffed it.

07:46.098 --> 07:48.000
And the grape.

07:48.067 --> 07:49.936
You had to be there.

07:50.002 --> 07:52.572
Oh, give her a break.
And be happy for Sam.

07:52.638 --> 07:53.940
She hasn't had a boyfriend
since fifth grade

07:54.006 --> 07:56.209
When Frankie Murkin
rudely dumped her.

07:56.275 --> 07:57.810
She broke Frankie's leg.

07:57.877 --> 08:00.046
Yes, and then
he rudely dumped her.

08:06.185 --> 08:07.687
-Your tea.
-Thanks.

08:07.753 --> 08:09.589
Okay, we only have
half of the next

08:09.655 --> 08:10.890
"iCarly" planned out,

08:10.957 --> 08:12.491
so let's figure out
What else we're gonna do.

08:12.558 --> 08:14.493
Sam, where's the list
of "iCarly" Ideas?

08:15.828 --> 08:18.297
Sam?

08:26.873 --> 08:28.374
This is a drawing of you
and Jonah

08:28.441 --> 08:30.076
in a big heart surrounded
by smaller hearts.

08:32.912 --> 08:33.913
Oh, give me that.

08:38.284 --> 08:39.552
Okay.

08:39.619 --> 08:41.486
We were talking about
doin' either the bit

08:41.554 --> 08:43.890
with the giant fan
that blows stuff

08:43.956 --> 08:45.157
or the wedgie-bounce.

08:45.224 --> 08:46.626
I don't know.

08:46.692 --> 08:50.596
The wedgie-bounce thing
kind of scares me, you know?

08:50.663 --> 08:51.831
Sam, what do you think?

08:53.232 --> 08:55.434
-Sam.
-Shh.

08:55.501 --> 08:57.436
Okay, this is getting annoying.

08:57.503 --> 08:58.571
How are we gonna rehearse

08:58.638 --> 09:00.373
if she won't
quit texting Jonah.

09:00.439 --> 09:01.607
Maybe like this?

09:04.143 --> 09:06.245
Hi, I'm Carly, and I'm Sam.

09:06.312 --> 09:07.880
And this is a new bit
we like to call,

09:07.947 --> 09:12.418
"Obsessively texting
your boyfriend."

09:12.485 --> 09:14.387
Hey, your hair looks pretty.

09:19.225 --> 09:21.160
Adjust.

09:21.227 --> 09:23.829
Shoot, print.

09:23.896 --> 09:26.232
Adjust.

09:26.299 --> 09:28.668
Shoot, print. Sports drink.

09:33.072 --> 09:34.106
What's he doin'?

09:34.173 --> 09:35.441
He's making a claymation movie.

09:35.508 --> 09:37.543
Oh, cool.

09:37.610 --> 09:39.312
Is that a hamster
wearing a space helmet?

09:39.378 --> 09:40.846
Don't touch my movie.

09:42.348 --> 09:43.916
It's all very precise.

09:43.983 --> 09:46.118
If you move or change
one little thing,

09:46.185 --> 09:47.520
I got to start all over again.

09:47.586 --> 09:49.155
How much have you done?

09:49.221 --> 09:51.424
Fifteen more shots, I'll have
the first two seconds finished.

09:51.490 --> 09:52.658
Two seconds?

09:52.725 --> 09:54.126
How long's the whole movie?

09:54.193 --> 09:59.966
Ten minutes, which means
I got about 14,367 shots to go.

10:01.167 --> 10:02.935
Shoot, print.

10:03.002 --> 10:05.171
14,366.

10:09.175 --> 10:10.576
Hey, where are you going?

10:10.643 --> 10:12.445
Jonah's at the Groovy Smoothie.
Gotta go meet him there.

10:12.511 --> 10:13.646
Wait.

10:13.713 --> 10:14.847
But we're supposed to...

10:16.983 --> 10:18.417
What's her deal?

10:18.484 --> 10:20.186
Sam has a new boyfriend
and he's all she thinks about.

10:20.252 --> 10:22.922
Ah, the honeymoon phase.

10:22.989 --> 10:24.223
What do you mean?

10:24.290 --> 10:26.225
Well, when someone's
in a new relationship,

10:26.292 --> 10:28.227
It's like they're blind
to everything else

10:28.294 --> 10:29.628
but that other person.

10:29.695 --> 10:31.530
Like when I started dating
that girl, Jennifer,

10:31.597 --> 10:33.699
I had a bad case of poison
ivy for two whole weeks.

10:33.766 --> 10:34.867
I didn't even know.

10:34.934 --> 10:36.268
What made you finally notice?

10:36.335 --> 10:39.538
Well, it spread to places.

10:42.141 --> 10:43.442
Where?

10:47.446 --> 10:49.548
-Oh.
-Yeah.

10:54.020 --> 10:55.287
Where is she?

10:55.354 --> 10:57.690
Rehearsal was supposed
to start a half-hour ago.

10:57.757 --> 10:59.692
I'm calling her.
Put it on speaker.

10:59.759 --> 11:01.093
I want a piece of this.

11:03.496 --> 11:04.964
Hey, you got my voicemail.

11:05.031 --> 11:06.766
I'm here with the
awesomest guy ever.

11:06.832 --> 11:08.367
And I'm here
with the cutest girl ever.

11:08.434 --> 11:10.236
Oh, baby.

11:10.302 --> 11:12.138
We're gonna be at the
water park all afternoon.

11:12.204 --> 11:13.706
So, don't bug us.

11:13.773 --> 11:16.242
And don't sniff
the fruit salad.

11:16.308 --> 11:17.676
-Goodbye.
-Goodbye.

11:19.812 --> 11:21.013
Can you believe her?

11:21.080 --> 11:22.715
She blew off
"iCarly" Rehearsal.

11:22.782 --> 11:25.785
So she could go play
with Jonah?

11:25.851 --> 11:28.421
Well, I know
how we could get back at her.

11:28.487 --> 11:29.789
Huh?

11:29.855 --> 11:31.057
You and I should start dating.
That way...

11:31.123 --> 11:32.825
-Freddie.
-I know.

11:44.570 --> 11:47.406
-Sam.
-I didn't do it.

11:47.473 --> 11:49.075
Oh, it's just you.

11:49.141 --> 11:50.843
Yeah. It's just me.

11:50.910 --> 11:53.979
The girl from iCarly who showed
up at rehearsal yesterday.

11:54.046 --> 11:55.681
I was with Jonah.

11:55.748 --> 11:57.850
Yeah.
We need to talk about this.

11:57.917 --> 11:59.418
Okay. Let's talk.

11:59.485 --> 12:01.053
I'm really happy that you're
going out with Jonah But...

12:01.120 --> 12:03.289
-It's me.
-Isn't that cute?

12:03.355 --> 12:05.825
Jonah recorded it to play
every time he texts me.

12:05.891 --> 12:09.295
It's adorable and I thought
we were talking.

12:09.361 --> 12:10.963
We are. Sorry.

12:11.030 --> 12:13.132
I was saying,
I think it's great that...

12:13.199 --> 12:14.400
It's me.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.339
Look, I'm really glad
you're all happy.

12:20.406 --> 12:21.640
And have a boyfriend
and everything,

12:21.707 --> 12:23.676
but iCarly is important to me
and Freddie.

12:23.742 --> 12:24.910
It's important to me too.

12:24.977 --> 12:26.278
Then start acting like it.

12:26.345 --> 12:27.813
It's me.

12:27.880 --> 12:30.449
If you try to open the locker,
I will bite your hand off.

12:31.984 --> 12:35.087
Listen, I'm sorry
I missed rehearsal,

12:35.154 --> 12:38.023
it's just Jonah makes me
so happy

12:38.090 --> 12:40.526
and, you know,
I haven't had a boyfriend,

12:40.593 --> 12:42.061
since Frankie Murkin
fell out of that tree

12:42.128 --> 12:43.329
and broke his leg.

12:43.395 --> 12:45.498
Yeah. "Fell."

12:45.564 --> 12:47.533
Fell, was pushed.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.703
The point is I've been
single a long time.

12:50.769 --> 12:52.204
It's me.

12:52.271 --> 12:54.673
Be at rehearsal on time today
and be focused on us.

12:54.740 --> 12:56.609
Okay. I'll be there.

12:57.810 --> 12:59.845
Promise.

12:59.912 --> 13:01.280
Hug?

13:01.347 --> 13:04.183
I will hug you when I see you
at rehearsal.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.386
-Deal.
-It's me.

13:07.453 --> 13:10.356
-It's me.
-Carly, wait, my phone.

13:10.422 --> 13:12.191
I got it.

13:28.841 --> 13:30.643
Okay, let's make sure
this baby works.

13:32.411 --> 13:35.915
Yeah. Okay. Okay, okay.
Okay, it works.

13:35.981 --> 13:38.050
Sorry.

13:38.117 --> 13:40.619
Yeah.
Say you're sorry to my hair.

13:44.456 --> 13:45.758
Hey, you're here.

13:45.824 --> 13:47.826
And she brought Jonah.

13:47.893 --> 13:49.662
What's up, player?

13:49.728 --> 13:50.863
Carly.

13:50.930 --> 13:52.598
Uh, listen.

13:52.665 --> 13:54.433
iCarly rehearsals
are kinda private so...

13:54.500 --> 13:55.634
Oh, no worries.

13:55.701 --> 13:56.835
He's just gonna sit over there

13:56.902 --> 13:57.836
and look cute
while we do our stuff.

13:57.903 --> 13:59.171
You won't even know I'm here.

14:00.339 --> 14:02.575
Okay.

14:02.641 --> 14:03.676
Let's rehearse the wig bit.

14:03.742 --> 14:05.110
-Oh, I love the wig bit.
-Okay.

14:05.177 --> 14:09.048
Rehearsing in five,
four, three, two...

14:13.018 --> 14:14.520
Hi, I'm Carly.

14:14.587 --> 14:16.622
I live with my brother Spencer,
I do my homework,

14:16.689 --> 14:18.023
and I shower every day.

14:20.359 --> 14:21.393
Good one.

14:24.396 --> 14:25.331
I'm Sam.

14:25.397 --> 14:26.699
I do bad things, harass people,

14:26.765 --> 14:29.168
and eat everything that
doesn't eat me first.

14:35.541 --> 14:36.842
Okay, good stuff.

14:36.909 --> 14:38.210
You guys wanna try
the fan bit next?

14:38.277 --> 14:40.613
-Sure.
-Yeah, the fan bit.

14:40.679 --> 14:42.781
Uh, here's the thing.

14:42.848 --> 14:44.416
Jonah doesn't think it's funny.

14:45.985 --> 14:49.054
It seems kinda lame to me.

14:51.757 --> 14:52.891
Okay.

14:52.958 --> 14:54.326
Well, then maybe
we should talk about

14:54.393 --> 14:55.828
a new "Messin' with Lewbert."

14:55.894 --> 14:57.997
The guy in your lobby
with the big wart on his face?

14:58.063 --> 14:59.365
Yeah.

14:59.431 --> 15:01.734
You know what you guys
should call that dude?

15:01.800 --> 15:03.469
"Captain wart burger."

15:05.237 --> 15:09.074
Captain wart burger?
That's gold, baby.

15:10.042 --> 15:11.410
Captain wart burger?

15:11.477 --> 15:13.445
No, you gotta say it
like Jonah did.

15:15.114 --> 15:16.782
Yeah, and Carly,
when you're doing the wig bit,

15:16.849 --> 15:19.184
You gotta act more like Sam.

15:20.552 --> 15:21.553
Weird.

15:21.620 --> 15:23.455
I thought
I was acting like Sam.

15:23.522 --> 15:25.591
Have you ever thought
taking acting lessons?

15:32.231 --> 15:33.265
I can't believe it,

15:33.332 --> 15:36.135
"You won't even know I'm here."

15:36.201 --> 15:37.970
He was totally
bossing us around

15:38.037 --> 15:39.338
Sam was encouraging him.

15:39.405 --> 15:41.140
Shh.
They're right behind us.

15:41.206 --> 15:42.541
Oh, they won't hear me.

15:42.608 --> 15:44.743
They're too busy giggling
about captain wart burger.

15:46.345 --> 15:47.546
Yeah, you could be all,

15:47.613 --> 15:49.481
"Hello there,
"Captain wart burger.

15:49.548 --> 15:51.417
"Would you like
a side of wart fries?"

15:52.818 --> 15:54.286
Wart fries?"

15:55.587 --> 15:57.523
-I need a snack.
-Fruit kebab?

15:57.589 --> 15:59.091
Sure.

15:59.158 --> 16:00.459
Hey, what's going on over here?

16:00.526 --> 16:03.128
Oh, Carly's brother
is making a movie.

16:03.195 --> 16:05.097
Check out this dude.

16:05.164 --> 16:06.398
No, don't touch that.

16:06.465 --> 16:08.901
Okay.
Mr. Space hamster, we're...

16:08.967 --> 16:13.238
oh my god.

16:13.305 --> 16:15.474
My movie is ruined.

16:15.541 --> 16:17.309
I have to start all over again

16:17.376 --> 16:19.478
and my deadline's
in less than 24 hours.

16:19.545 --> 16:20.946
Ha, ha, look, its arm came off.

16:21.013 --> 16:22.514
Ha, ha, yeah.

16:22.581 --> 16:24.350
Why don't you stay for dinner
and rip my heart out?

16:26.352 --> 16:28.087
Dude, don't cry about it.

16:28.153 --> 16:29.555
Oh, fruit kebabs.

16:30.889 --> 16:32.424
I'm out.

16:32.491 --> 16:33.659
-Text you later.
-Kick it!

16:37.129 --> 16:38.697
Aw, how cute is he?

16:38.764 --> 16:41.333
Yeah.

16:50.042 --> 16:51.677
Hey, you wanted talk to me,
Carly-o?

16:51.744 --> 16:53.612
No need to add the "O,"
Just sit down.

16:54.913 --> 16:57.383
Sure.

16:57.449 --> 16:59.818
Jonah, I wanna
talk to you about Sam.

16:59.885 --> 17:01.587
My lady.

17:01.653 --> 17:04.256
Yes.

17:04.323 --> 17:05.958
I'm really happy you guys
are so into each other.

17:06.023 --> 17:07.626
But I need Sam for the show.

17:07.693 --> 17:09.094
So you can't
keep distracting her

17:09.161 --> 17:10.194
and coming to rehearsals...

17:10.262 --> 17:11.696
Sam hasn't complained about it.

17:11.763 --> 17:13.598
Yeah, 'cause she's so into you,
she can't think straight.

17:13.665 --> 17:15.000
Oh.

17:15.067 --> 17:17.035
You don't like me spending
so much time with Sam.

17:17.102 --> 17:18.569
No.

17:18.637 --> 17:21.272
So maybe I should spend
a little less time with Sam

17:21.339 --> 17:23.208
and a little more time
with someone else.

17:23.275 --> 17:25.344
What are you doing?

17:25.411 --> 17:26.912
-Kiss me.
-What?

17:26.979 --> 17:28.213
Sam doesn't have to know.

17:28.280 --> 17:31.617
Ow, did you just thump me?

17:31.683 --> 17:34.253
How dare you try to kiss me
when you're dating Sam?

17:34.319 --> 17:38.290
You're icky,
and I'm telling Sam.

17:39.625 --> 17:41.360
Whoa, whoa.
You don't wanna do that.

17:41.427 --> 17:42.628
Oh, well, why not?

17:42.694 --> 17:44.763
'cause think about
how happy I make Sam.

17:44.830 --> 17:46.532
What kind of friend
would you be

17:46.598 --> 17:49.334
If you ruined her first great
relationship by rattin' me out?

17:49.401 --> 17:51.270
Carly, I got the...

17:51.336 --> 17:53.405
hey, cupcake,
What are you doing here?

17:53.472 --> 17:54.773
Carly asked me to come over.

17:54.840 --> 17:58.143
Yeah.

17:58.210 --> 17:59.545
To tell help me
with my imitation of you

17:59.611 --> 18:01.280
for the wig bit.

18:06.018 --> 18:07.152
I'm Sam.

18:07.219 --> 18:08.720
I like to eat pork chops
in bed.

18:08.787 --> 18:11.423
That's exactly
how I'd say that.

18:13.492 --> 18:15.594
-You're so helpful.
-Yeah.

18:20.899 --> 18:25.270
14,327, 14,326.

18:25.337 --> 18:26.438
Hey, Spencer, how's the...

18:26.505 --> 18:28.674
Carly, Freddie is here.

18:28.740 --> 18:30.309
14,325.

18:32.945 --> 18:34.713
I'm freaking out, Freddie.
Freaking out.

18:37.382 --> 18:38.817
-Did you talk to Jonah?
-Yeah.

18:38.884 --> 18:39.885
And he tried to kiss me.

18:39.952 --> 18:41.253
He totally tried to kiss me.

18:41.320 --> 18:42.754
-No way.
-Yeah.

18:42.821 --> 18:44.656
You're sure
Jonah tried to kiss you?

18:44.723 --> 18:45.991
Well, let's see.

18:46.058 --> 18:47.259
He said, "Kiss me,"
Then puckered his lips.

18:47.326 --> 18:48.927
So call me crazy,
but I think the boy wanted

18:48.994 --> 18:50.829
some Carly kissin'.

18:50.896 --> 18:52.498
That jerk.

18:52.564 --> 18:54.366
No one tries to kiss my girl.

18:55.868 --> 18:59.037
No one tries to kiss you.

18:59.104 --> 19:00.405
So are you gonna tell Sam?

19:00.472 --> 19:03.408
I was gonna, but Jonah makes
Sam really happy

19:03.475 --> 19:05.978
and I don't want her
to get hurt.

19:06.044 --> 19:07.346
Yeah.

19:07.412 --> 19:08.480
Hey, we should get upstairs.

19:08.547 --> 19:09.982
iCarly starts in three minutes.

19:11.950 --> 19:14.086
14,317.

19:14.152 --> 19:15.654
14,316.

19:17.089 --> 19:18.357
14,315.

19:19.825 --> 19:21.460
14,314.

19:22.628 --> 19:25.464
14,313.

19:25.531 --> 19:27.299
I am having a horrible time.

19:40.112 --> 19:41.613
Hey, you were supposed
to get me an iced tea.

19:41.680 --> 19:43.282
Oh, yeah.

19:43.348 --> 19:44.917
There wasn't any.

19:46.385 --> 19:47.853
-You guys ready?
-Ready.

19:47.920 --> 19:49.354
Yup.

19:49.421 --> 19:51.757
Sweetie, why don't you stand
over there behind Freddie.

19:51.823 --> 19:54.126
Whatevs.

19:54.192 --> 19:55.594
Okay, girls.

19:55.661 --> 20:00.499
iCarly starts in five,
four, three, two...

20:00.566 --> 20:03.302
-Hey, welcome to iCarly.
-Dot com.

20:03.368 --> 20:04.903
And I hope you know
what "Com" Stands for.

20:04.970 --> 20:06.805
'Cause we don't.

20:08.006 --> 20:09.408
Hey, Sam, ever wonder
what it'd be like

20:09.474 --> 20:10.909
if we were each other?

20:10.976 --> 20:12.144
Yeah.

20:12.210 --> 20:13.612
But do you mind
if we don't start off

20:13.679 --> 20:14.913
with the wig bit tonight?

20:14.980 --> 20:17.182
Uh, okay.

20:17.249 --> 20:19.885
So what do you wanna do first?

20:21.386 --> 20:22.454
But we haven't tested it yet.

20:22.521 --> 20:23.755
So, let's test it now.

20:23.822 --> 20:25.190
But who are we gonna get to...

20:25.257 --> 20:27.359
Okay, iCarly fans,
we're gonna start off the night

20:27.426 --> 20:30.028
with a new bit starring
my boyfriend, Jonah.

20:30.095 --> 20:31.396
Woo.

20:31.463 --> 20:33.365
Get up here, Jonah.

20:34.833 --> 20:36.835
What am I doin'?

20:36.902 --> 20:38.870
Trust me, baby,
this is gonna be awesome.

20:38.937 --> 20:40.439
Yes, yes, it is.

20:42.274 --> 20:44.209
Okay, Jonah,
you stand right here.

20:44.276 --> 20:45.477
Okay.

20:45.544 --> 20:48.013
Next, I climb up
and get the big red rope

20:48.080 --> 20:49.314
with the large hook.

20:49.381 --> 20:52.985
-Pretty cool.
-Yeah.

20:53.051 --> 20:54.453
And now, Sam hooks the rope

20:54.519 --> 20:56.855
onto the back
of Jonah's underwear.

20:56.922 --> 20:58.523
My underwear?

20:58.590 --> 21:00.592
Just go with it, Jonah.

21:00.659 --> 21:03.395
Relax, this is gonna be fun.

21:03.462 --> 21:04.730
Okay, Freddie.

21:04.796 --> 21:06.164
Is the button on Sam's remote
ready to activate

21:06.231 --> 21:07.599
our special surprise?

21:07.666 --> 21:09.034
Yup. Bottom button.

21:09.101 --> 21:14.306
{\an8}And now, iCarly Presents
The wedgie-bounce.

21:14.373 --> 21:15.774
The wedgie-bounce?
Wait, wait, wait.

21:15.841 --> 21:17.509
-Guys, I didn't...
-It begins!

21:19.211 --> 21:22.347
Sam, this feels weird.

21:22.414 --> 21:24.316
Sam.

21:24.383 --> 21:25.984
This is so invasive.

21:37.462 --> 21:38.797
So you found out.

21:38.864 --> 21:41.033
I heard you
and Freddie talking.

21:41.099 --> 21:42.601
I'm really sorry.

21:42.668 --> 21:43.969
Why are you sorry?

21:44.036 --> 21:46.838
'cause I know he made you
all happy and stuff.

21:48.473 --> 21:49.474
Come on.

21:49.541 --> 21:50.809
Pork chops make me happy

21:50.876 --> 21:52.744
and they don't try
to kiss my best friend.

21:56.682 --> 21:59.284
-It's cool, I'm all right.
-Good.

21:59.351 --> 22:00.419
But now
I kinda want a pork chop.

22:00.485 --> 22:02.320
I know, right?

22:03.188 --> 22:05.424
So when are we gonna get
to see Spencer's movie?

22:05.490 --> 22:06.658
Right now.

22:06.725 --> 22:08.460
I just finished
burning the DVD.

22:10.295 --> 22:11.596
So how'd you finish it early?

22:11.663 --> 22:12.964
Oh, just watch it.

22:23.075 --> 22:25.977
I am a space hamster.

22:26.044 --> 22:29.848
Burritos are food.

22:36.955 --> 22:37.856
That was it?

22:37.923 --> 22:38.957
Well, it would've been longer

22:39.024 --> 22:40.092
if Jonah hadn't
ruined everything

22:40.158 --> 22:41.593
and made me start over.

22:41.660 --> 22:43.962
Don't worry, Sam took care
of Jonah on iCarly tonight.

22:44.029 --> 22:45.931
-What do you mean?
-Come look.

22:48.834 --> 22:52.137
Guys, come on, seriously.

22:52.204 --> 22:54.372
This is so uncool.

22:54.439 --> 22:56.241
You wedgie-bounced him?

22:56.308 --> 22:58.110
{\an8}Are stille-bounced him?

22:58.176 --> 22:59.177
{\an8}This is happening live.

22:59.244 --> 23:01.046
Sam.

23:01.113 --> 23:03.782
This has been going
on for two hours.

23:03.849 --> 23:06.585
My underwear, It's hurting me.

23:13.725 --> 23:15.227
Hi, Carly, Sam and Freddie.

23:15.293 --> 23:16.561
I'm Liliana.

23:16.628 --> 23:18.563
I'm twelve years old
and I'm from California.

23:32.911 --> 23:34.646
I love your show, you guys.
Bye.
