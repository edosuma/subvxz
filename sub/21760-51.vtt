Lucky: Man, what a crazy
spring vacation.

01:12.290 --> 01:14.920
Spot was right to just
stay home and relax.

01:14.920 --> 01:17.790
I mean, first Cruella
invites herself along

01:17.790 --> 01:20.040
and tries to take over
the trip...

01:20.040 --> 01:23.210
then Roger and Anita find out
they're not legally married,

01:23.210 --> 01:25.080
so they decide to head
to the church

01:25.080 --> 01:26.790
and this time get married
for real.

01:26.790 --> 01:28.170
But Cruella finds out

01:28.170 --> 01:30.330
that if she can keep them
from getting married

01:30.330 --> 01:32.210
in the next ten days...

01:32.210 --> 01:35.040
Then their farm
is as good as mine.

01:35.040 --> 01:36.210
Memo to myself:

01:36.210 --> 01:39.880
Ha ha ha ha ha ha!

01:47.040 --> 01:48.250
Aaaaaaah!

01:49.620 --> 01:51.170
Whoa!

01:55.460 --> 01:58.210
Lucky: Okay, everybody,
huddle up.

01:58.210 --> 01:59.880
If we don't do something fast,

01:59.880 --> 02:03.170
Cruella's gonna mess up Roger
and Anita's wedding plans.

02:03.170 --> 02:06.210
She's already
messed up
our vacation.

02:06.210 --> 02:08.210
Don't think of this
as a vacation,

02:08.210 --> 02:12.330
think of it as a mission
to stop Cruella
from getting the farm.

02:14.290 --> 02:15.620
Aha!

02:22.040 --> 02:23.210
Eee... yeah.

02:23.210 --> 02:24.620
Hmm?

02:26.920 --> 02:28.000
Yes!

02:34.250 --> 02:35.670
Watch where you're
going, Ratchet.

02:35.670 --> 02:38.580
Sorry, Cruella, they don't
put potholes on the map.

02:38.580 --> 02:39.920
Arrrgh!

02:39.920 --> 02:43.250
Just a few more miles
and we can stop
for the night.

02:43.250 --> 02:47.380
Ah, good! I don't know how much
more of that woman I can take.

02:47.380 --> 02:50.330
Cruella: Oh, he's just
absolutely ruined my makeup!

02:55.420 --> 02:57.670
Well, I hope they
have a vacancy.

02:57.670 --> 02:59.960
I hope we don't need
a police escort.

02:59.960 --> 03:02.750
Horace, Jasper, where are you?

03:02.750 --> 03:05.040
I need your help to make sure
that the Dearlys

03:05.040 --> 03:07.080
don't make it
to the church on time!

03:07.080 --> 03:09.500
We've run
into a little problem.

03:09.500 --> 03:11.750
Don't give me any backtalk!

03:11.750 --> 03:15.420
Just pick me up at...
the Big Odor Motel

03:15.420 --> 03:17.790
And come by tonight
after everyone's asleep.

03:17.790 --> 03:19.620
Jasper: Glub-glub-glub!

03:19.620 --> 03:23.210
That excuse doesn't hold water.

03:23.210 --> 03:25.580
Ah, lousy connection!

03:25.580 --> 03:29.210
We'll gonna have
to work in shifts
to keep an eye on her.

03:29.210 --> 03:31.120
Only one room available?

03:31.120 --> 03:33.750
Women:
Good night, Daddy!

03:33.750 --> 03:35.420
Yep, just
the honeymoon suite.

03:36.420 --> 03:39.040
All right!
Now we're talkin'.

03:39.040 --> 03:41.000
But what about Cruella?

03:42.170 --> 03:44.750
Not to worry: Anita and I
will share the room,

03:44.750 --> 03:48.040
and you, Rangoon,
can sleep on the bus.

03:48.040 --> 03:49.250
Excuse me?!

03:49.250 --> 03:52.710
Well, after all, you two
aren't really married.

03:52.710 --> 03:55.210
What kind of
a cad are you?

03:55.210 --> 03:58.380
I hate to say it,
but, technically,

03:58.380 --> 04:00.500
she's right.
Good night, hon.

04:00.500 --> 04:04.080
Great.
This is just perfect!

04:09.580 --> 04:11.210
Your turn, Cruella.

04:11.210 --> 04:12.670
Finally!

04:12.670 --> 04:16.170
Time for my nightly
beauty regimen.

04:16.170 --> 04:19.250
Good looks
are such a burden.

04:28.620 --> 04:31.790
Ahhh! I feel so refreshed.

04:31.790 --> 04:34.120
Huh?

04:48.960 --> 04:51.420
Red alert!
Cruella's sneaking out!

04:51.420 --> 04:54.120
-Rolly: Yikes!

04:55.210 --> 04:59.420
Hey, man, I was in the land
of happy pork chops.

04:59.420 --> 05:00.540
Not now, Rolly.

05:00.540 --> 05:03.080
You and I will see
what Cruella's up to.

05:03.080 --> 05:06.670
Cadpig, you stay behind
and keep an eye
on Roger and Anita.

05:06.670 --> 05:08.080
Okeydokey.

05:15.040 --> 05:17.670
It's about time you got here,
you Neanderthals.

05:17.670 --> 05:20.000
Ohh!

05:20.000 --> 05:21.500
Ooooh!

05:21.500 --> 05:23.460
Uh... sorry.

05:23.460 --> 05:26.080
We took the scenic route
at the waterfall.

05:26.080 --> 05:28.880
Oh, now I need dry clothes.

05:28.880 --> 05:33.540
Nitwits. They just don't plan
for the unexpected. Uh...

05:34.960 --> 05:37.040
Now's our chance!

05:48.460 --> 05:49.670
Huh?

05:49.670 --> 05:50.960
Good morning.

05:50.960 --> 05:52.580
Good morning.

05:52.580 --> 05:54.960
So, how did you sleep?

05:54.960 --> 05:57.000
Oh... a little lonely.

05:59.670 --> 06:02.000
Ah, except
for the pups.

06:02.000 --> 06:02.960
How about you?

06:02.960 --> 06:06.170
Hmm. I can't decide
if it was you

06:06.170 --> 06:08.210
or the pups
I missed most.

06:08.210 --> 06:09.880
Woof-woof!

06:09.880 --> 06:12.040
Woof-woof!

06:12.040 --> 06:13.380
Oh!

06:13.380 --> 06:14.710
Mmm!

06:14.710 --> 06:17.000
Well, here's something
you won't miss.

06:17.000 --> 06:21.460
Cruella left this note
saying that she had
to leave on urgent business.

06:21.460 --> 06:25.460
I guess we'll just have
to finish the vacation
without her.

06:25.460 --> 06:28.880
Whoo-hoo! You know
what this means?

06:28.880 --> 06:31.880
Now we'll have time to do
all the things I wanna do!

06:31.880 --> 06:33.880
Like watch
the Biddleburg Bivalves

06:33.880 --> 06:35.290
at spring training!

06:35.290 --> 06:38.040
That's fine, darling,
but remember,

06:38.040 --> 06:40.210
we don't want to be
late for our wedding.

06:40.210 --> 06:42.880
Ah, don't worry, I'll get you
to the church on time.

06:42.880 --> 06:44.790
91, 92...

06:44.790 --> 06:46.250
Hey, hey, hey, no pushing.

06:46.250 --> 06:48.880
93, 94...

06:48.880 --> 06:51.710
97, 98...

06:51.710 --> 06:53.500
Uh, 100...

06:53.500 --> 06:55.830
Um, 104?

06:55.830 --> 06:58.170
Well, it always seems
to even out in the end.

07:00.380 --> 07:02.170
Roger: Main Squeeze Falls.

07:02.170 --> 07:03.670
Lover's Landfill.

07:03.670 --> 07:04.790
Kisser's Canyon.

07:04.790 --> 07:07.000
Great! We're right on schedule.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.330
Roger, stop!

07:10.750 --> 07:13.960
Roger: Oh, man, this is
gonna mess up everything!

07:13.960 --> 07:16.710
Looks like we don't
have much of a choice.

07:23.420 --> 07:26.170
Where do you get
your ideas?

07:26.170 --> 07:28.330
Jasper: Ah, I seen it
in a cartoon once.

07:28.330 --> 07:31.920
Well, that oughta hold
the Drearys for now.

07:31.920 --> 07:34.750
They'll be lost
in the desert for days!

07:39.790 --> 07:41.420
Lucky: Okay, I think I got it.

07:43.420 --> 07:45.420
Hey! Wait! Crowded!

07:49.080 --> 07:50.620
Oooh!

07:50.620 --> 07:53.830
Cruella: There. The Drearys
are off on a wild goose chase.

07:53.830 --> 07:56.250
That should delay their wedding
long enough for me

07:56.250 --> 07:58.460
to get the farm.

07:58.460 --> 08:00.120
Now, let's get back to Grutely.

08:00.120 --> 08:01.960
Not in this truck,
they won't.

08:01.960 --> 08:03.920
I'm gonna disconnect
the ignition wires

08:03.920 --> 08:06.540
just like I saw
in a Thunderbolt show.

08:09.330 --> 08:12.710
I thought you were turning it
off, not turning it on!

08:12.710 --> 08:15.710
Okay, so I didn't see
the whole episode.

08:18.330 --> 08:19.750
Stop that truck!

08:22.750 --> 08:25.880
We're careening
out of control!

08:25.880 --> 08:28.750
We're only going
five miles an hour.

08:28.750 --> 08:31.750
Well, that's how
a careen starts.

08:48.670 --> 08:50.790
Whew! That was a close one.

08:50.790 --> 08:52.460
Yeah.

08:52.460 --> 08:56.120
You're... not... kidding.

08:56.120 --> 08:57.880
What did you do that for?

08:57.880 --> 09:01.710
You broke my truck!
That bumper is coming
out of your pay!

09:01.710 --> 09:03.670
Horace: What's a bullet train?

09:03.670 --> 09:06.380
(train horn blows,
bell clanging)

09:10.830 --> 09:12.750
My clothes!

09:12.750 --> 09:15.540
My truck!

09:16.880 --> 09:18.380
Stop!

09:18.380 --> 09:22.210
I don't care how
you do it,

09:22.210 --> 09:24.880
but get this truck
back together!

09:29.790 --> 09:31.790
(horn blaring,
Spot muttering)

09:31.790 --> 09:34.420
Vacation? Hah!

09:34.420 --> 09:36.620
My feet are extra crispy.

09:36.620 --> 09:39.120
My feathers are drying out.

09:39.120 --> 09:41.920
And my b-b-beak's starting
to peel.

09:43.580 --> 09:45.750
I wonder where the pups are.

09:51.210 --> 09:53.500
I thought you said
turn left.

09:53.500 --> 09:54.830
Now we're more lost
than ever.

09:54.830 --> 09:59.210
You know, dear, if you had
just stopped and asked
for directions,

09:59.210 --> 10:00.580
we wouldn't be lost.

10:00.580 --> 10:03.420
Well, honey, if you knew
how to read a map,

10:03.420 --> 10:06.580
we wouldn't need
to ask for directions,
now, would we?

10:06.580 --> 10:08.960
What

10:08.960 --> 10:11.750
Well, it really doesn't
matter now, does it?

10:11.750 --> 10:14.290
Roger: But I just filled it.

10:14.290 --> 10:17.420
Hey, someone drilled
a hole in our gas can.

10:17.420 --> 10:20.000
Hey, someone drilled
a hole in our gas tank.

10:20.000 --> 10:23.670
And I bet I know who.
We need help.

10:23.670 --> 10:26.420
Time to alert
the barking chain!

10:32.620 --> 10:33.670
♪♪♪

10:49.880 --> 10:54.040
This is the barking chain,
not the food chain.

10:55.750 --> 10:58.170
Spot: "Gas up, pay up,
and get out!"

10:58.170 --> 11:00.080
My, how friendly.

11:00.080 --> 11:02.210
Ha ha! At last!

11:02.210 --> 11:05.620
H20!

11:05.620 --> 11:08.580
Ohhhhh! Nooo!

11:17.080 --> 11:20.500
My! That was
surprisingly refreshing.

11:20.500 --> 11:22.580
What's that?

11:22.580 --> 11:25.670
Stranded in DK Valley.
Come quick.

11:25.670 --> 11:28.080
Bark once to hear
the message repeat

11:28.080 --> 11:31.330
or three times to return
to the main menu.

11:34.290 --> 11:36.500
Oh, you call this driving?

11:36.500 --> 11:38.580
We're being passed by road kill!

11:38.580 --> 11:42.000
We'll never get back to Grutely
at this rate!

11:45.330 --> 11:47.830
Yaaaah!

11:47.830 --> 11:49.710
Blecch!

11:49.710 --> 11:54.710
Uhh! I think I got
a bug in my teeth!

11:54.710 --> 11:55.960
Not bad, though.

12:04.960 --> 12:06.620
Aaaah!

12:08.540 --> 12:09.880
Hey, a cop!

12:09.880 --> 12:13.330
If we can get Cruella busted,
she can't get back to Grutely.

12:15.040 --> 12:16.210
Aah!

12:17.500 --> 12:19.540
Oh, no, we gotta
do something!

12:19.540 --> 12:20.620
Wait a minute!

12:20.620 --> 12:23.580
Okay, Rolly,
you know what to do.

12:23.580 --> 12:25.120
both: Nyeh nyeh nyeh nyeh!

12:25.120 --> 12:27.920
Nobody shakes puppy butt at me!

12:29.210 --> 12:31.620
I haven't got time
for a speeding ticket!

12:34.040 --> 12:35.540
Oh! Tell me again

12:35.540 --> 12:37.580
why this is
a good plan?

12:45.330 --> 12:47.170
Aaaaah!

12:50.670 --> 12:53.620
Ha ha ha!
So much for
Officer Friendly.

13:00.500 --> 13:02.500
Aaah!

13:07.120 --> 13:09.540
Aaaaah!

13:11.880 --> 13:13.170
Horace: We're safe.

13:15.380 --> 13:17.580
Ow! Oh!

13:22.580 --> 13:26.290
I hope she
doesn't have a run
in those stockings.

13:28.210 --> 13:30.880
You had to open
your big mouth.

13:30.880 --> 13:33.210
Aaaaaaaah!

13:43.040 --> 13:45.460
Drop that fish.

13:49.960 --> 13:52.790
Anita: Well, why don't we try
to walk over to that hill

13:52.790 --> 13:54.540
and look for help?

13:54.540 --> 13:56.540
What, with your sense
of direction?
No way.

13:56.540 --> 13:59.580
Besides, there's nothing
around but sand
and scorpions.

13:59.580 --> 14:03.460
It's better than sitting here
and turning into vulture jerky.

14:07.330 --> 14:09.380
Hey, look,
someone's coming!

14:21.290 --> 14:23.620
Is that... our chicken?

14:26.670 --> 14:28.330
Hello, Spot!

14:28.330 --> 14:29.920
Spot, what made you

14:29.920 --> 14:31.540
decide to come along?

14:31.540 --> 14:34.580
A serious error in judgment.

14:34.580 --> 14:36.420
How did you get out here?

14:36.420 --> 14:39.330
What are you talking about?
The road's right over that hill.

14:43.540 --> 14:45.330
Thank you very much,
uh, sir.

14:45.330 --> 14:47.830
Y'all come back, now!

14:47.830 --> 14:51.750
This is all your fault.
All my clothes, everything lost!

14:51.750 --> 14:53.670
But you were
the one driving.

14:53.670 --> 14:56.920
Ohh! Don't interrupt me
when I'm reassigning blame.

14:56.920 --> 15:01.580
Well, at least the Dearlys
will be stuck in the desert
for a long, long time.

15:05.380 --> 15:08.500
Get me a car, pronto!

15:08.500 --> 15:12.250
Roger: Well, it looks like if
we skip Honeymoon Hot Springs,

15:12.250 --> 15:14.500
we can make it
to Biddleburg
for spring training

15:14.500 --> 15:17.080
and still have
plenty of time
to get to the church!

15:17.080 --> 15:19.500
-Uh-oh!

15:19.500 --> 15:21.620
I don't think
we're going anywhere.

15:22.620 --> 15:25.830
Roger: Maybe a day at the beach
wouldn't be such a bad thing.

15:27.420 --> 15:29.460
The beach, eh?

15:29.460 --> 15:30.750
This gives me an idea,

15:30.750 --> 15:34.380
one that will ensure
the Dearlys miss their deadline.

15:35.670 --> 15:36.710
Oooh!

15:38.540 --> 15:40.250
Roger: Now,
this is more like it.

15:40.250 --> 15:43.920
White sand, blue water,
fresh air, and no Cruella.

15:43.920 --> 15:46.670
Ahhh! What more
can you ask for?

15:46.670 --> 15:50.040
You're right, darling.
I think I'll go for a swim.

15:50.040 --> 15:53.460
But we still have to get going.
We've got a big day ahead of us.

15:53.460 --> 15:54.460
Roger: Mm-hmm.

15:55.330 --> 15:57.670
Do you
smell something?

15:57.670 --> 16:00.880
Yeah.
Kind of like old leather.

16:00.880 --> 16:03.210
both: Cruella!

16:03.210 --> 16:06.460
Excellent!
Rhombus is alone.

16:06.460 --> 16:07.790
This will be the perfect chance

16:07.790 --> 16:11.120
for me to test my "sexy girl
at the beach" costume.

16:11.120 --> 16:14.040
I'll have that marriage
broken up in no time.

16:14.040 --> 16:18.170
What are you waiting for?
Inflate me!

16:23.170 --> 16:26.710
You could at least
help me paddle.

16:26.710 --> 16:29.080
Ah, we're lost.
Why bother?

16:29.080 --> 16:30.880
Just take it easy.

16:30.880 --> 16:32.210
This is the life.

16:32.210 --> 16:35.500
No more worries, no more cares.

16:35.500 --> 16:37.330
No more river.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.830
I think we've hit the ocean.

16:39.830 --> 16:41.380
What makes you
say that?

16:44.790 --> 16:46.540
Oh, my Aunt Marie!

16:46.540 --> 16:49.250
I need to find
a fire hydrant
quick!

16:49.250 --> 16:52.290
Let go of me
and start paddling!

17:01.580 --> 17:03.620
It's showtime.

17:03.620 --> 17:05.460
-Ohh!

17:05.460 --> 17:07.040
Ohhh!

17:08.620 --> 17:12.210
Oh, no! Men are suckers
for that inflatable look!

17:12.210 --> 17:14.670
We've gotta stop
that blowfish.
She's evil!

17:14.670 --> 17:18.210
Well, hello,
Hunkalicious.

17:18.210 --> 17:20.170
Cowabunga, Moondoggie.

17:20.170 --> 17:23.790
What say we hang ten, dud--
uh, dude.

17:23.790 --> 17:28.250
Hello. Do you
speak English?

17:28.250 --> 17:32.380
Oh, surf's up!
Let's you and me
catch a wave.

17:32.380 --> 17:33.210
Spot: Aha!

17:36.750 --> 17:38.670
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

17:38.670 --> 17:39.830
Huh?

17:39.830 --> 17:42.290
I can't move!

17:42.290 --> 17:45.250
Hey, dudes, surf's up!

17:45.250 --> 17:46.830
Cruella: Ooh! Ow! Ooh!

17:50.830 --> 17:53.580
Get off of me,
you insolent goon!

17:53.580 --> 17:55.500
I --

17:55.500 --> 17:58.000
Let's hang ten!

17:58.000 --> 17:59.580
Oh, no!

18:02.120 --> 18:03.790
Ohh!

18:08.080 --> 18:10.000
Do you smell something?

18:11.170 --> 18:14.330
Yeah. Smells like
old, wet leather.

18:14.330 --> 18:18.120
Dude, is this one
ugly surfboard. Eww!

18:18.120 --> 18:19.920
Rolly, look!

18:19.920 --> 18:22.080
There's Cadpig
and everyone!

18:22.080 --> 18:24.290
Hey, over here!

18:24.290 --> 18:25.290
Hey!

18:25.290 --> 18:28.210
Lucky, Rolly,
you made it back!

18:28.210 --> 18:30.420
Spot, what are you
doing here?

18:30.420 --> 18:33.330
Getting my yearly dose
of punishment.

18:33.330 --> 18:36.250
All right, thanks,
little puppy dudes.

18:36.250 --> 18:38.460
I thought I'd lost
my new board.

18:44.540 --> 18:46.880
Roger: Well, here we
are at last!

18:46.880 --> 18:50.920
Spring training camp
for the Biddleburg Bivalves.

18:50.920 --> 18:53.210
Yeah, this is gonna be great!

18:53.210 --> 18:56.420
I'm gonna get to see
the mighty Bivalves in action.

18:56.420 --> 18:59.830
Did I ever tell you
I used to play for
a championship team?

18:59.830 --> 19:02.670
Dear, you were
five years old.

19:02.670 --> 19:06.380
Ah, yes,
the Pillwater Peewees.

19:06.380 --> 19:07.790
Those were the days.

19:07.790 --> 19:09.080
Well, let's not stay too long.

19:09.080 --> 19:11.420
We don't want to miss
our own wedding.

19:11.420 --> 19:14.040
Yeah, yeah, uh,
sure thing, hon.

19:14.040 --> 19:19.290
Whoo-hoo! There's my idol.
First baseman One Shoe Joe!

19:19.290 --> 19:22.040
Cruella: Pillwater Peewees?

19:22.040 --> 19:25.120
Hey, Jasper, how
about a dog since
we're here and all?

19:25.120 --> 19:26.880
Not a bad idea,
Horry.

19:26.880 --> 19:29.380
Knock it off, you two!
You know what to do.

19:29.380 --> 19:31.460
I don't want any mess-ups
this time.

19:31.460 --> 19:36.080
Wow! This is great!
Better than I ever imagined.

19:38.040 --> 19:39.420
Well, I'll be.

19:39.420 --> 19:41.170
I still got it.

19:41.170 --> 19:43.620
Hey, here you go, guys!

19:43.620 --> 19:46.040
Oh! Ow! Darn rotator cuff.

19:46.040 --> 19:49.120
man: Holy hootenanny,
it's Roger Dearly.

19:49.120 --> 19:51.880
I saw you
play baseball with
the Pillwater Peewees.

19:51.880 --> 19:54.620
You were the best
short-- Ow!

19:54.620 --> 19:56.750
Pitcher in the league.

19:56.750 --> 19:59.210
Gee, thanks, guys,

19:59.210 --> 20:01.710
but that was
a long time ago.

20:01.710 --> 20:04.040
We're putting
together a new team.

20:04.040 --> 20:05.920
The Caracas Cucarachas.

20:05.920 --> 20:07.790
And we'd love
to have you join.

20:07.790 --> 20:09.210
Of course, you'll
have to leave

20:09.210 --> 20:11.420
for Venezuela
immediately.

20:11.420 --> 20:14.120
And cancel any other
plans you might have.

20:14.120 --> 20:16.040
Wow! Really?

20:16.040 --> 20:19.210
Oh, this is a lifelong dream
come true.

20:19.210 --> 20:21.750
I mean, I'd sure...

20:21.750 --> 20:23.040
No, no, sorry, guys.

20:23.040 --> 20:26.330
I wish I could, but I'm
on my way to get married again.

20:26.330 --> 20:28.170
I would never want
to disappoint Anita.

20:28.170 --> 20:30.330
Thanks anyway.

20:30.330 --> 20:32.170
Psst!

20:33.540 --> 20:36.420
She wants us
to tickle his hand?

20:36.420 --> 20:39.830
Get his autograph,
you cabbage heads!

20:39.830 --> 20:41.500
-Ow!
-I knew that.

20:41.500 --> 20:43.920
Excuse us, but since
we're such big fans,

20:43.920 --> 20:45.380
could we get
your autograph?

20:45.380 --> 20:47.620
Oh, well, certainly.

20:47.620 --> 20:50.000
Press hard.
There's a lot
of carbons.

20:50.000 --> 20:51.960
Thank you very much.

20:53.670 --> 20:55.620
Here's your copy
of the contract, lady.

20:55.620 --> 20:57.750
Your husband's gonna make
a great ball player.

20:57.750 --> 21:01.460
He'll be leaving
for Venezuela immediately.

21:01.460 --> 21:04.420
What? Oh, no!

21:04.420 --> 21:06.250
This has to be
a mistake!

21:06.250 --> 21:08.790
The stench
of Cruella's
treachery

21:08.790 --> 21:10.040
is all over this

21:10.040 --> 21:12.500
like a fish taco
in the hot sun.

21:12.500 --> 21:14.920
Or am I stating
the obvious?

21:14.920 --> 21:17.000
Well, I've seen
enough for today.

21:17.000 --> 21:18.790
I bet you have.

21:18.790 --> 21:21.540
How could you choose
baseball over our wedding?

21:21.540 --> 21:22.710
What?

21:22.710 --> 21:24.170
Huh?
What's this?

21:24.170 --> 21:26.120
Cucarachas?

21:26.120 --> 21:27.380
Venezuela!

21:27.380 --> 21:28.880
Oh, no!

21:28.880 --> 21:30.290
No, Anita, wait.
Come on.

21:30.290 --> 21:32.040
There's been
a mistake, really.

21:32.040 --> 21:34.080
I didn't do it.

21:34.080 --> 21:37.040
Maybe it's a good thing
we were never married
in the first place.

21:39.040 --> 21:40.460
There!

21:40.460 --> 21:43.170
It's up to us to keep
this nuclear family

21:43.170 --> 21:44.960
from splitting like an atom.

21:46.920 --> 21:48.880
I'll take care of Anita.

21:48.880 --> 21:51.210
You just get Roger
to the church on time!

21:51.210 --> 21:53.830
Roger: Anita, wait,
I can explain!

21:53.830 --> 21:54.830
Don't go!

21:54.830 --> 21:56.460
Please!

21:56.460 --> 22:00.920
Oh, how terrible!
They're going to lose the farm.

22:00.920 --> 22:03.710
How could this have happened?

22:03.710 --> 22:06.750
Oh, I know! I did it.
