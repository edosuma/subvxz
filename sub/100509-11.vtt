WEBVTT

00:43.710 --> 00:45.545
Watch it.

01:17.786 --> 01:20.580
You actually captured him. I'm impressed.

01:20.663 --> 01:22.207
That is what the council wanted.

01:22.874 --> 01:26.127
Still. You succeeded
where many have failed.

01:26.753 --> 01:29.422
I've learned from the best, including you.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.677
I wish I was good at something
other than war.

01:38.598 --> 01:40.850
Your people need a new kind of leader.

01:42.519 --> 01:46.815
My sister tried that.
I never understood her idealism.

01:52.362 --> 01:55.031
Commander. I have the council waiting.

01:55.782 --> 01:58.785
And Master Skywalker?
Were you able to contact him?

01:59.703 --> 02:01.871
He was at the meeting
when I left to get you.

02:02.789 --> 02:04.624
Go on. I can handle this.

02:23.351 --> 02:25.562
I sense a plot to destroy the Jedi.

02:26.479 --> 02:28.815
The dark side of the Force
surrounds the Chancellor.

02:30.191 --> 02:32.485
If he does not give up
his emergency powers

02:32.569 --> 02:34.154
after the destruction of Grievous,

02:34.237 --> 02:36.531
then he should be removed from office.

02:38.491 --> 02:40.827
The Jedi Council
would have to take control of the Senate

02:40.910 --> 02:43.079
in order to secure a peaceful transition.

02:44.205 --> 02:48.626
To a dark place,
this line of thought will carry us.

02:48.710 --> 02:50.545
Hmm.

02:50.628 --> 02:53.673
Great care, we must take.

02:59.262 --> 03:01.598
I understand your mission was a success.

03:02.640 --> 03:05.018
Yes. I have Maul in custody.

03:05.101 --> 03:08.355
I will escort Commander Rex
when he delivers him to Coruscant.

03:08.730 --> 03:12.067
A great service to the Republic,
you have done.

03:12.525 --> 03:14.361
I did my duty as a citizen.

03:15.320 --> 03:16.905
Not as a Jedi.

03:18.823 --> 03:21.159
No. Not yet.

03:24.621 --> 03:28.291
Actually, I was hoping
to speak with General Skywalker.

03:29.292 --> 03:31.002
I sent him to inform the Chancellor

03:31.086 --> 03:34.422
that General Grievous
has indeed been located on Utapau.

03:34.964 --> 03:36.132
Master Kenobi?

03:36.466 --> 03:39.177
Engaged the enemy, he has.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.846
Then the war could be over soon.

03:42.847 --> 03:45.016
That depends on the Chancellor.

03:46.476 --> 03:47.769
What do you mean?

03:49.729 --> 03:54.317
I'm sorry, citizen. These matters
are for the council to discuss.

03:55.985 --> 03:57.237
I understand.

04:08.081 --> 04:13.503
Ahsoka. More to say, have you?
A message for Skywalker, perhaps?

04:19.551 --> 04:24.472
No, Master. Thank you.
I'll tell him myself when I see him.

04:26.057 --> 04:29.436
May the Force be with you, Padawan.

04:32.480 --> 04:36.109
You didn't tell them
what Maul said about General Skywalker.

04:38.111 --> 04:39.612
No, I didn't.

05:30.246 --> 05:34.167
Impressive. I suspect even Maul
couldn't get out of there.

05:35.085 --> 05:36.920
A relic of a bygone era

05:37.003 --> 05:40.757
when Mandalorians had reason
to imprison you Force-wielding maniacs.

05:41.341 --> 05:44.010
I thought your sister
outlawed such devices.

05:45.011 --> 05:48.598
She did. This is the last one.

05:59.317 --> 06:01.444
Goodbye, Ahsoka Tano.

08:23.086 --> 08:24.921
Something on your mind?

08:27.465 --> 08:33.513
As a Jedi, we were trained to be
keepers of the peace, not soldiers.

08:34.264 --> 08:37.684
But all I've been since I was a Padawan
is a soldier.

08:38.643 --> 08:42.439
Well, I've known no other way.

08:43.356 --> 08:46.526
Gives us clones all a mixed feeling
about the war.

08:47.152 --> 08:49.738
Many people wish it never happened.

08:50.572 --> 08:55.410
But without it, we clones wouldn't exist.

08:56.578 --> 08:59.956
Well, then perhaps some good has come
from all of it.

09:00.540 --> 09:05.170
The Republic couldn't have asked for
better soldiers, nor I a better friend.

09:14.512 --> 09:16.765
Commander Rex,
the latest briefing has come in.

09:17.682 --> 09:18.808
Want to have a look?

09:18.892 --> 09:21.644
It might have an update
on General Kenobi's efforts.

09:22.395 --> 09:25.148
You go. I'm sure it's more good news.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.593
You must choose.

09:54.511 --> 09:56.388
Don't listen to him, Anakin!

09:56.471 --> 09:59.307
It's not the Jedi way.
He must live.

09:59.391 --> 10:00.743
He's too dangerous
to be left alive.

10:00.767 --> 10:02.435
- Please don't.
- I need him.

10:02.519 --> 10:06.523
Unlimited power!

10:11.194 --> 10:12.278
What have I done?

10:13.697 --> 10:14.781
Anakin?

10:19.327 --> 10:22.747
Execute Order 66.

10:23.331 --> 10:24.749
Yes, Lord Sidious.

10:28.378 --> 10:33.258
Rex. It's Anakin. I feel like
something terrible has happened.

10:39.806 --> 10:40.807
Rex?

10:42.225 --> 10:43.309
No!

10:43.393 --> 10:45.270
I'll do it.

10:45.353 --> 10:47.439
Rex, what's happening?

10:47.939 --> 10:49.024
Stay back!

10:51.317 --> 10:54.112
Find him. Find him.

10:54.195 --> 10:56.322
Fives. Find him! Fives!

11:06.291 --> 11:07.291
Rex!

11:21.681 --> 11:23.841
- She's down. She's down.
- Hold your fire! We got her!

11:48.583 --> 11:50.752
Sir, are you all right?

11:51.628 --> 11:54.547
Fine, just tired is all.

11:54.631 --> 11:57.842
I want you to go to the detention level.
Execute Maul.

11:58.301 --> 11:59.302
Yes, sir.

11:59.719 --> 12:00.720
All right, men.

12:03.890 --> 12:06.643
All right.
We know Ahsoka Tano is on board.

12:06.726 --> 12:10.063
She's been marked for termination
by Order 66.

12:10.146 --> 12:13.066
Under this directive,
any and all Jedi leadership

12:13.149 --> 12:16.319
must be executed for treason
against the Republic.

12:16.736 --> 12:21.408
Any soldier that does not comply with the
order will also be executed for treason.

12:21.491 --> 12:23.493
- Understood?
- Yes, sir!

12:24.077 --> 12:26.329
There are only so many places
to hide on this ship.

12:26.413 --> 12:30.500
Gather up search parties. We'll fan out
and move section by section.

12:31.084 --> 12:33.420
Come on. Let's get moving.

13:10.165 --> 13:11.958
Look out!

13:20.884 --> 13:22.218
Don't make me regret this.

13:29.351 --> 13:33.021
You... You survived.

13:33.980 --> 13:37.400
Is this your doing?
Choose your words carefully.

13:37.859 --> 13:40.737
No, no. It was not my doing.

13:40.820 --> 13:45.575
I do not know what has occurred,
but, surely, you have felt it.

13:45.658 --> 13:49.579
The voices crying out. The death.

13:50.246 --> 13:53.583
The clones turned against me. Even Rex.

13:54.000 --> 13:57.504
I don't know why,
they just suddenly weren't themselves.

13:58.838 --> 14:03.176
Brilliant. Brilliant.

14:05.720 --> 14:11.851
I was not privy to my master's plan,
but now, now I see it.

14:11.935 --> 14:16.356
He turned the Jedi's own army
against them.

14:19.109 --> 14:22.362
Well, you've done the right thing
by coming to me.

14:22.445 --> 14:26.366
Only together can we survive this.
Now, if you will follow my lead...

14:26.449 --> 14:30.036
You don't understand.
I'm not here to team up with you.

14:30.453 --> 14:33.206
I need a diversion, and you're it.

14:34.040 --> 14:36.710
Now go cause some chaos.
It's what you're good at.

14:43.717 --> 14:47.637
Uh,
care to give me a fighting chance?

14:48.513 --> 14:52.434
I'm not rooting for you. Now get going.

15:09.951 --> 15:12.454
Sir, we finished our sweep
of the detention level.

15:12.537 --> 15:15.915
The prisoner has escaped.
There's no sign of Tano or Maul.

15:15.999 --> 15:19.669
Destroy the escape pods
and increase security on the hangar decks.

15:19.753 --> 15:20.754
Right away, sir.

15:51.242 --> 15:54.537
Shh.

15:54.621 --> 15:56.539
R7, I need your help.

15:58.917 --> 16:00.877
I know. I know.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.295
Shh. Quiet.

16:10.720 --> 16:13.556
I don't know. I don't know
why the clones are doing this.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.518
But we might be able
to do something about it.

16:18.478 --> 16:20.146
Are you sure you wanna help?

16:20.230 --> 16:21.606
It could be dangerous.

16:24.150 --> 16:28.238
Okay, let's get started.
R7, patch into the central computer.

16:28.321 --> 16:32.909
Bring up every secure file
on Clone Trooper CT-5555.

16:38.581 --> 16:41.376
Okay, Rex. What am I looking for?

16:46.965 --> 16:53.430
An independent investigation confirmed
that the Clone Trooper CT-5555

16:53.513 --> 16:57.100
experienced a malfunction
with his inhibitor chip.

16:57.183 --> 17:01.980
Both the Senate committee and the
Jedi Council have accepted these findings.

17:02.063 --> 17:08.194
However, a grievance report
was filed by CT-7567.

17:08.278 --> 17:09.988
R7, bring up that report.

17:11.448 --> 17:12.699
It's sealed?

17:13.491 --> 17:16.536
Try Anakin's pass code. 8-1-0-8.

17:19.414 --> 17:22.292
I already know this report is gonna fall
on deaf ears,

17:22.375 --> 17:25.879
but I owe it to Fives
to record what I saw.

17:27.255 --> 17:32.761
I'm not sure I believe it myself,
but there's a possibility

17:32.844 --> 17:35.889
that the inhibitor chips
the Kaminoans put inside of us

17:36.348 --> 17:40.643
have a purpose
that we don't yet fully understand.

17:44.022 --> 17:46.024
Fall back! Fall back!

18:11.216 --> 18:14.219
Ridge is down!
Maul's advancing toward the main hangar!

18:14.302 --> 18:16.554
You must seal
the blast doors. Stop his advance!

18:19.057 --> 18:20.809
Seal the blast door! Now!

18:30.568 --> 18:35.824
Trooper, did you seal the doors?
Trooper? If you read this, seal the door.

18:35.907 --> 18:38.034
We want to redirect his approach. Over.

18:47.669 --> 18:49.254
Hey, hey. Out of the way!

19:00.015 --> 19:01.057
Are you cross-wired?

19:05.228 --> 19:09.649
Rex. I think I know what's happening.
I saw your report on Fives.

19:10.108 --> 19:13.028
It isn't your fault. You were programmed.

19:13.111 --> 19:17.782
Your mind was altered to do this
when you were very young. I can help you.

19:18.783 --> 19:20.118
Where is she?

19:21.036 --> 19:22.120
I'm right here.

19:25.999 --> 19:28.877
Careful. We're trying not to hurt him.

19:30.545 --> 19:32.547
They've got the commander.
Bring the charges.

19:32.881 --> 19:35.425
Cheep, are all the doors sealed,
so the way is clear?

19:37.886 --> 19:40.096
Okay. Let's get him to the medical bay.

19:52.567 --> 19:53.735
Move it! Move it!

19:57.322 --> 19:59.032
Start working on these doors.

20:14.506 --> 20:16.216
R7, run a scan.

20:16.299 --> 20:18.885
See if you can find the inhibitor chip
the report talked about.

20:42.075 --> 20:44.953
But the chip has to be there. Check again.

20:57.382 --> 20:58.383
How close are they?

21:00.593 --> 21:05.015
G-G, if they override the door controls,
you have to reseal it fast.

21:08.226 --> 21:09.561
R7, anything?

21:25.452 --> 21:28.204
I am one with the Force,
and the Force is with me.

21:28.288 --> 21:31.041
I am one with the Force,
and the Force is with me.

21:31.124 --> 21:34.044
I am one with the Force,
and the Force is with me.

21:34.961 --> 21:37.589
I am one with the Force,
and the Force is with me.

21:38.590 --> 21:41.301
I am one with the Force,
and the Force is with me.

21:44.971 --> 21:45.972
You found it?

21:52.854 --> 21:55.065
R7, get him under and remove that thing.

21:56.858 --> 21:59.652
I don't know if it will work,
but if it doesn't, we're dead anyway.

22:07.577 --> 22:08.703
Go! Go!

22:14.084 --> 22:15.335
Get ready on the door.

22:42.195 --> 22:43.947
The door. G-G, the door!

22:52.247 --> 22:55.333
Rex? Are you okay?

22:56.459 --> 23:00.380
Yeah. Yeah, kid. I'm okay.

23:01.006 --> 23:02.799
I'm sorry for what happened earlier.

23:03.383 --> 23:05.593
I almost killed you.

23:06.052 --> 23:07.721
How widespread is this?

23:08.930 --> 23:11.808
Ahsoka, it's all of us.

23:12.225 --> 23:14.227
The entire Grand Army of the Republic

23:14.310 --> 23:19.315
has been ordered to hunt down
and destroy the Jedi Knights.
