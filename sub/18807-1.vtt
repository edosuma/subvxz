00:20.070 --> 00:23.196
The four phenomenal warriors,
representing the four galaxies,

00:23.206 --> 00:24.731
who will be special
participants in this,

00:24.741 --> 00:27.267
the Tenkaichi Grand Tournament,

00:27.277 --> 00:29.036
being hosted by world-class
multimillionaire Gyosan Money,

00:29.046 --> 00:31.405
have just arrived on Earth!

00:31.415 --> 00:34.741
Oh, my! Things have already
become more exciting!

00:34.751 --> 00:39.751
This is the first time I've ever seen
an alien, and I am quite impressed!

00:40.757 --> 00:44.217
And so, let us ask some
questions of Mr. Gyosan Money.

00:44.227 --> 00:47.754
What is the Tenkaichi
Grand Tournament, exactly?

00:47.764 --> 00:52.092
My adorable, only son, Doll,
badgered me for this, you see...

00:52.102 --> 00:55.762
It is our present to him
on his tenth birthday.

00:55.772 --> 00:58.765
Papa, are there really going
to be aliens?

00:58.775 --> 01:00.601
Oh, of course.

01:00.611 --> 01:03.370
This will be a raw battle between
the most powerful Earthlings and aliens.

01:03.380 --> 01:06.707
Papa is going to let you watch
it from these special seats.

01:06.717 --> 01:11.378
Doll, as long as you have money
in this world, you can do anything!

01:11.388 --> 01:15.048
P-Producer,
could we ask you to elaborate?

01:15.058 --> 01:18.685
The richest man in the world here,
Mr. Gyosan Money,

01:18.695 --> 01:23.695
is sponsoring the biggest
martial arts tournament ever!

01:24.735 --> 01:26.293
It's a tournament where,

01:26.303 --> 01:27.594
regardless of age, gender,
nationality, pro or amateur status,

01:27.604 --> 01:29.396
the most powerful combat sportsmen...

01:29.406 --> 01:31.498
...in the whole wide
world have been invited,

01:31.508 --> 01:34.401
and they can battle with
each other as hard as they want!

01:34.411 --> 01:37.404
The winner will receive
one hundred million zeni!

01:37.414 --> 01:39.339
Runner-up prizes of tour packages...

01:39.349 --> 01:41.541
for the entire family to the
hot springs resorts of the world...

01:41.551 --> 01:43.410
will also be presented!

01:43.420 --> 01:47.347
What's more, the winner
will meet that hero

01:47.357 --> 01:49.750
that saved humanity from
the terror of the Cell Games,

01:49.760 --> 01:54.760
something that my enormous wealth has
made possible for the first time...

01:57.768 --> 02:01.363
the right to challenge
Mister Satan in the ring!

02:17.721 --> 02:22.920
It's the ultra-gifted, most powerful
combat sportsman on earth, Mister Satan!

02:40.744 --> 02:44.942
So Cell has become the
one who defeated Cell, huh?

02:46.083 --> 02:48.210
That's okay, I guess.

03:01.431 --> 03:06.693
<i>Break through the shining clouds,</i>
<i>and fly away (fly away)</i>

03:06.703 --> 03:14.034
<i>As a panorama spreads</i>
<i>itself throughout my being!</i>

03:14.044 --> 03:19.372
<i>The earth, having been kicked</i>
<i>in the face, gets angry (angry)!</i>

03:19.382 --> 03:26.046
<i>And makes one of its
volcanoes explode!</i>

03:26.056 --> 03:32.719
<i>If, within the thawed polar ice,</i>

03:32.729 --> 03:41.728
<i>There is a dinosaur, then I want</i>
<i>to train him to balance atop a ball.</i>

03:41.738 --> 03:45.065
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

03:45.075 --> 03:54.074
<i>No matter what may happen,</i>
<i>I feel as though nothing can bother me,</i>

03:54.084 --> 03:57.744
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

03:57.754 --> 04:03.750
<i>However hard your chest pounds,</i>
<i>the Genki Dama will roar!</i>

04:03.760 --> 04:07.087
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

04:07.097 --> 04:16.096
<i>The emptier your head is, the more</i>
<i>room there is to pack with dreams,</i>

04:16.106 --> 04:19.432
<i>CHA-LA-HEAD-CHA-LA</i>

04:19.442 --> 04:26.439
<i>With a cheerful face and an Ultra-Z,</i>
<i>today is ai-yai-yai-yai-yai...</i>

04:26.449 --> 04:28.440
<i>Sparking!</i>

05:05.755 --> 05:11.022
"The Galaxy at its Threshold!
A Phenomenally Awesome Guy"

05:17.456 --> 05:19.782
There are exactly 200 contestants
here from all over the world,

05:19.792 --> 05:23.119
confident enough in their abilities to
gather at the Tenkaichi Grand Tournament.

05:23.129 --> 05:26.122
With the chance to challenge the
hero Mister Satan on the line,

05:26.132 --> 05:28.291
the preliminaries are already
being held...

05:28.301 --> 05:30.459
across eight different
battle stages at once!

05:30.469 --> 05:35.464
Each stage has 25 contestants fighting
it out in a Battle Royale format,

05:35.474 --> 05:40.469
and only the last remaining fighter
from each will advance to the semifinals!

05:40.479 --> 05:42.138
As for an explanation to the rules,

05:42.148 --> 05:44.941
contestants who fall from the
battle stage into the sea below,

05:44.951 --> 05:47.810
get knocked out, or give up,
are eliminated.

05:47.820 --> 05:52.548
However, one cannot,
of course, kill another opponent.

05:52.558 --> 05:55.584
Also, the use of weapons is
grounds for disqualification.

06:13.779 --> 06:17.010
I wonder who I should take with me on
my tour of the hot springs of the world.

06:17.783 --> 06:19.775
<i>Gohan-chan!</i>

06:19.785 --> 06:23.112
<i>Gohan-chan,</i> stick it to them!

06:23.122 --> 06:29.186
Huh? Gohan has entered?
But he's a Super Saiyan!

06:33.799 --> 06:40.034
N-not Piccolo, too! I don't suppose
Trunks is here as well, is he?

06:47.813 --> 06:52.113
If it was just Yamucha and Tenshinhan,
I figured this could have turned out.

06:57.823 --> 07:01.150
<i>Chichi-san,</i> I'm surprised
you let <i>Gohan-kun</i> enter.

07:01.160 --> 07:04.720
<i>Gohan-chan</i> does nothin'
but study day in and day out.

07:04.730 --> 07:08.090
If he doesn't keep his strength up,
it'll be all for nothin'.

07:08.100 --> 07:11.093
I was thinkin' it wouldn't be so bad
to let him relax once in a while.

07:11.103 --> 07:14.096
Is that right?
That's parental love for you.

07:14.106 --> 07:16.399
I wanted to take a tour
of the world's hot springs

07:16.409 --> 07:18.100
together with the rest of the family,

07:18.110 --> 07:22.505
and here Trunks had just
come back from the future

07:22.515 --> 07:25.107
to report that he had defeated
No. 17 and No. 18,

07:25.117 --> 07:27.443
so this is a golden opportunity for us!

07:27.453 --> 07:29.445
What's Vegeta doin'?

07:29.455 --> 07:33.849
That man is useless! It's almost
as if he's lost the desire to fight,

07:33.859 --> 07:37.787
and he spends his days
just thinking about stuff.

07:37.797 --> 07:40.493
That's because of <i>Goku-sa</i> dyin'.

07:43.469 --> 07:45.801
<i>Ten-san,</i> go get them!

07:46.472 --> 07:49.131
You too, Kuririn, as long as we're at it.

07:49.141 --> 07:52.907
Oolong, there aren't any
<i>pichi-pichi</i> gals around!

07:54.814 --> 07:56.906
Gramps, what are you looking at?

07:56.916 --> 07:58.808
We came to watch a martial
arts tournament, right?

07:58.818 --> 08:00.776
We don't need to watch

08:00.786 --> 08:03.412
to know that Gohan or Trunks is
obviously going to win, don't we?

08:03.422 --> 08:07.552
That's why I'm on the lookout for
gals with D-cups and T-back thongs!

08:10.763 --> 08:12.594
There they are!

08:13.766 --> 08:14.757
"Bounce"

08:14.767 --> 08:15.756
"Jiggle"

08:23.776 --> 08:27.436
This is even more incredible
than the Tenkaichi Tournament!

08:27.446 --> 08:30.106
You wish you could enter, huh?

08:30.116 --> 08:33.573
But you're a dead man now.

08:34.120 --> 08:37.953
A fight between Gohan and
Trunks is sure to be awesome!

08:47.466 --> 08:51.927
I never would have thought that
Gohan and those guys would enter.

08:51.937 --> 08:55.131
And here I borrowed money
to take a plane here.

08:55.141 --> 08:57.800
I was going to earn a
hundred million zeni, too.

08:57.810 --> 09:01.003
It looks like <i>Yamucha-san</i>
doesn't feel like fighting at all.

09:01.013 --> 09:02.405
There's no helping him, huh?

09:02.415 --> 09:05.408
He's given up on winnin', after all.

09:05.418 --> 09:08.411
That's right. He can't beat Trunks.

09:08.421 --> 09:10.184
Or <i>Gohan-chan,</i> either!

09:25.438 --> 09:27.065
Disqualified!

09:28.441 --> 09:30.432
Over already?

09:38.117 --> 09:40.009
A long time ago,

09:40.019 --> 09:44.547
Father also entered the Tenkaichi
Tournament and worked on his skills,

09:44.557 --> 09:45.922
so that goes for me, too!

09:46.792 --> 09:49.659
Contestant Son Gohan has
passed the preliminaries!

09:56.135 --> 09:59.036
Contestant Trunks has
passed the preliminaries!

10:18.157 --> 10:19.148
How come?

10:19.158 --> 10:21.456
Contestant Kuririn has
passed the preliminaries!

10:25.164 --> 10:27.598
Contestant Piccolo has
passed the preliminaries!

10:32.171 --> 10:34.401
Contestant Tenshinhan has
passed the preliminaries!

10:34.840 --> 10:36.000
What!?

10:40.179 --> 10:44.673
Contestant Dosukoi, Contestant Udo,
and Contestant Kung Foon have passed!

10:50.189 --> 10:51.780
Mister Satan,

10:51.790 --> 10:54.020
having seen the preliminaries,
what are your impressions?

10:55.861 --> 10:59.855
N-none of them have
had enough training...

10:59.865 --> 11:02.358
The semifinals will consist
of the eight contestants

11:02.368 --> 11:05.201
who passed through the preliminaries
fighting one-on-one against each other.

11:06.138 --> 11:09.098
With Piccolo as my opponent,
luck is not on my side.

11:09.108 --> 11:11.474
Geez, this is the worst!

11:12.811 --> 11:15.971
The first match of the
semifinals will be a fight

11:15.981 --> 11:18.176
between Contestant Son Gohan
and Contestant Udo.

11:21.153 --> 11:25.481
What is this, a kid as my opponent?
This isn't my day.

11:25.491 --> 11:29.587
Hey, kid! I'm not holding back on you,
just because you're little, got it?

11:30.829 --> 11:33.155
Right, understood!

11:33.165 --> 11:36.158
What? Jerk me around, will you?

11:36.168 --> 11:37.829
Why, you!

11:42.508 --> 11:44.601
Attaboy, <i>Gohan-chan!</i>

11:48.180 --> 11:50.039
The second match of the
semifinals will be a fight

11:50.049 --> 11:53.644
between Contestant Trunks
and Contestant Tenshinhan.

11:55.521 --> 12:00.083
Trunks! I'm not letting
you go easy on me!

12:00.859 --> 12:01.859
Right!

12:14.139 --> 12:16.131
T-they're floating in mid-air!

12:16.141 --> 12:18.905
It looks that way to me, too!

12:24.149 --> 12:25.707
<i>Kiko-ho!</i>

12:57.182 --> 13:00.509
M-Mister Satan, how can this be?

13:00.519 --> 13:04.079
Hmph! I-it's all tricks! Like the
quick costume changes in a Kabuki play!

13:04.089 --> 13:06.782
Something like that!

13:06.792 --> 13:11.627
W-what are those guys doing at
a dinky tournament like this?

13:14.800 --> 13:16.961
Sheesh, how worthless!

13:31.817 --> 13:34.285
Contestant Trunks wins!

13:49.835 --> 13:51.827
<i>I-I have to do something!</i>

13:51.837 --> 13:55.329
My, Mister Satan,
you're looking pale.

13:56.175 --> 13:59.168
M-my stomach hurts! Yow-ow-ow-ow!

13:59.178 --> 14:04.106
This won't do! Producer,
take Mister Satan to the dispensary.

14:04.116 --> 14:11.784
I-I'll go by myself. I-I'll be
right back... Yow-ow-ow-ow!

14:12.458 --> 14:15.655
I'd better just go on and scram.

14:16.795 --> 14:20.456
They say that only fools rush in where
angels fear to tread, after all...

14:20.466 --> 14:23.459
Oh, it's Mister Satan!

14:23.500 --> 14:28.500
Satan...! Satan...!

14:34.146 --> 14:39.584
<i>T-this is no time for me</i>
<i>to be doing this!</i>

14:50.829 --> 14:52.988
The third match of the semifinals

14:52.998 --> 14:55.466
will be between Contestant Kuririn
and Contestant Piccolo.

14:57.836 --> 15:02.765
<i>Piccolo wouldn't use his</i>
<i>Makankosappo blast on me, would he?</i>

15:02.775 --> 15:08.680
<i>Piccolo-san!</i> Good luck!
<i>Piccolo-san!</i>

15:09.448 --> 15:13.776
Gohan doesn't need to be
cheering Piccolo on.

15:13.786 --> 15:16.779
After all, there's
no way Kuririn can win.

15:16.789 --> 15:18.347
Dammit!

15:19.124 --> 15:22.582
<i>If this is how it's going to be,</i>
<i>then I'm going to go out big!</i>

15:30.135 --> 15:32.828
What's with that indifferent stance!?

15:32.838 --> 15:37.673
He's doing that to make a fool of me!
He's definitely making a fool of me!

15:39.144 --> 15:41.704
Piccolo!

15:54.159 --> 15:57.820
I thought there were going to be some
guys here with a little fortitude.

15:57.830 --> 16:01.027
I'm not about to stay here and
hang around with you any longer.

16:14.112 --> 16:16.672
As a result of Contestant Piccolo
forfeiting the match,

16:16.682 --> 16:19.082
Contestant Kuririn wins!

16:19.785 --> 16:22.720
Lucky! Bonus, bonus!

16:23.455 --> 16:26.415
Contestant Dosukoi narrowly
turns the tables and wins!

16:26.425 --> 16:30.452
The four contestants who will proceed
to the finals have been decided!

16:30.462 --> 16:33.789
<i>Kaio-sama,</i> what's the situation?

16:33.799 --> 16:38.460
Oh, Gohan and the others are
winning their way through smoothly.

16:38.470 --> 16:40.665
I suppose they would be, huh?

16:51.483 --> 16:57.979
Good grief, there's no way my pupils
could beat those outrageous guys...

17:01.159 --> 17:03.855
I made it! There's the exit!

17:11.103 --> 17:12.502
Mister Satan!

17:15.107 --> 17:19.768
The dispensary is that way.
This way is the exit to Battle Island.

17:19.778 --> 17:24.106
That's fine!
My stomachache is chronic...

17:24.116 --> 17:28.443
It would be best if I had my
personal physician look at me.

17:28.453 --> 17:30.445
B-but what about Mr. Money?

17:30.455 --> 17:33.715
It's all right, it's all right,
I'll be right back.

17:33.725 --> 17:38.162
I'll just dash on over the bridge,
here, and then dash on... dash on...

17:38.797 --> 17:40.697
Huh?

17:42.467 --> 17:45.368
Am I starting to get dizzy, too?

17:48.473 --> 17:52.134
It's gone! It's gone! It's gone!
The bridge is gone!

17:52.184 --> 17:57.184
Satan...! Satan...!

18:01.486 --> 18:06.486
For the finals, we're relocating
the arena to Battle Island II.

18:06.592 --> 18:08.287
We're currently underway.

18:11.430 --> 18:14.423
With the battle stage now
on Battle Island II,

18:14.433 --> 18:16.391
we are just about ready

18:16.401 --> 18:18.760
to hold the finals with these
four powerful competitors,

18:18.770 --> 18:20.635
with a challenge to Mister
Satan at stake!

18:31.450 --> 18:34.681
<i>Gohan-chan!</i>
Stick it to them!

18:35.120 --> 18:36.778
This is embarrassing.

18:36.788 --> 18:41.191
Trunks! Take me along on
that world hot springs tour!

18:43.795 --> 18:47.094
Kuririn! Hang in there
as reasonably as you can!

18:52.137 --> 18:54.463
And now, I shall explain the rules.

18:54.473 --> 18:57.566
There are four specially-built
underground tunnels here,

18:57.576 --> 18:59.801
each one leading to one of the north,
south, east, or west Battle Zones.

18:59.811 --> 19:01.436
The contestants have drawn lots

19:01.446 --> 19:03.739
to determine who will go ride in the
machines for each tunnel and continue on,

19:03.749 --> 19:06.742
until they arrive in their
respective Battle Zone.

19:06.752 --> 19:10.145
Once they do, there will
be a phenomenal warrior,

19:10.155 --> 19:12.748
here all the way from the North,
South, East, and West Galaxies,

19:12.758 --> 19:14.182
who has come here
especially to participate

19:14.192 --> 19:16.592
in the Tenkaichi Grand Tournament,
waiting there for them!

19:18.764 --> 19:20.622
The system continues so that
after defeating that warrior,

19:20.632 --> 19:22.424
whoever gets on the elevator
above them,

19:22.434 --> 19:26.928
and is the first one back here,
at the ground-level center stage,

19:26.938 --> 19:31.500
will be the glorious winner,
and will challenge Mister Satan!

19:34.112 --> 19:36.705
If I can get by without
having to fight Gohan directly,

19:36.715 --> 19:39.843
there's still a good enough
chance left that I could win!

19:41.787 --> 19:44.780
All right, all I have to do is
be the first one back, right?

19:44.790 --> 19:49.451
The final round now starts!
10... 9...

19:49.461 --> 19:51.119
8...

19:51.129 --> 19:52.454
7...

19:52.464 --> 19:54.122
6...

19:54.132 --> 19:55.457
5...

19:55.467 --> 19:56.792
4...

19:56.802 --> 19:58.460
3...

19:58.470 --> 19:59.795
2...

19:59.805 --> 20:01.463
1...

20:01.473 --> 20:02.770
0!

20:13.819 --> 20:18.620
Please enjoy the fight in the
Battle Zone on the monitor screens.

20:30.836 --> 20:33.464
I-I'm going to wet myself!

21:20.152 --> 21:23.553
So this is the Battle Zone, huh?

21:33.498 --> 21:35.966
Are you my opponent!?

21:39.504 --> 21:43.832
I've already faced Piccolo today,
and my luck is running strong.

21:43.842 --> 21:48.870
It sure is unlucky for you to
have to fight me like this.

21:51.850 --> 21:55.684
S-she's so cu~ute!

21:57.189 --> 21:58.613
B-but still,

21:58.623 --> 22:01.183
just because you're a woman,
you won't get any mercy from me!

22:01.193 --> 22:03.627
I'm going to be the first one back!

22:26.484 --> 22:29.248
W-who are you!?

22:34.492 --> 22:36.551
K-Kuririn!

22:44.836 --> 22:47.495
<i>Dosukoi! Dosukoi!</i>

22:47.505 --> 22:50.165
<i>Dosukoi! Dosukoi!</i>

22:50.175 --> 22:54.976
<i>Dosukoi... Dosu... koi...</i>

23:08.793 --> 23:10.658
He killed him!

23:26.144 --> 23:28.470
What's going on here!?

23:28.480 --> 23:30.472
Dear, this is going too far!

23:30.482 --> 23:34.142
P-Producer,
what is the meaning of this!?

23:34.152 --> 23:37.245
I-I didn't invite those guys!

23:37.255 --> 23:41.483
The Galactic Warriors I arranged
for were Mister Satan's pupils!

23:41.493 --> 23:43.290
How could they have
switched places so quickly?

23:44.162 --> 23:45.459
Mama!

23:47.165 --> 23:48.132
What!?

24:13.124 --> 24:18.053
Haven't you got things backward here!?
This is just a game!

24:18.063 --> 24:19.690
We're not out to kill each other!

24:29.808 --> 24:31.605
Who are you!?

24:36.147 --> 24:39.412
Would it be enough if I said
I was just a Galactic Warrior?

25:54.159 --> 25:57.152
Stop that! This is a
martial arts tournament!

25:57.162 --> 25:59.858
You're saying this is a game?

26:06.438 --> 26:08.201
What's going on?

26:13.778 --> 26:18.073
Mister Satan!
Everything depends on your power now!

26:18.083 --> 26:20.442
Please help us somehow! We beg you!

26:20.452 --> 26:24.112
J-just hang on a second!
My stomach still hurts!

26:24.122 --> 26:28.249
<i>If I can buy some time here, then those</i>
<i>other guys should defeat them for me.</i>

26:28.259 --> 26:30.489
<i>They defeated Cell, after all.</i>

26:56.488 --> 26:58.581
Are you finished already?

27:04.429 --> 27:06.158
Die!

27:38.796 --> 27:40.855
W- what is this?

27:43.801 --> 27:45.530
That's an incredible <i>Ki!</i>

27:49.807 --> 27:53.134
Mister Satan! Hurry! Hurry!

27:53.144 --> 27:57.472
Don't be so impatient!
I'm just wiping now!

27:57.500 --> 28:02.500
Satan...! Satan...!
Satan...! Satan...!

28:18.102 --> 28:20.263
Thank goodness!

28:24.108 --> 28:26.167
Ladies and gentlemen,
please be at ease!

28:26.177 --> 28:30.438
Our hero, Mister Satan, is setting
forth to put down these bad guys!

28:30.448 --> 28:32.340
Everything is all right now!

28:32.350 --> 28:36.684
Please observe the monitor screens
to see Mister Satan in action!

28:41.793 --> 28:43.785
H- hurry up and start this thing!

28:43.795 --> 28:44.452
Right!

28:44.462 --> 28:46.794
Wait! I haven't fastened the seatbelt!

28:47.465 --> 28:50.059
Earth is in a great pinch.

28:51.135 --> 28:54.462
Who would have figured on Bojack?

28:54.472 --> 28:56.464
Bojack?

28:56.474 --> 29:00.668
Long ago, he was a thug,
brimming with an evil <i>Ki,</i>

29:00.678 --> 29:02.737
who wandered the North,
South, East, and West Galaxies,

29:02.747 --> 29:06.407
attempting to destroy each
one of them.

29:06.417 --> 29:08.409
You mean someone like
Piccolo Daimao?

29:08.419 --> 29:13.748
He was a bloodthirsty devil, with an
evil <i>Ki</i> far greater than Piccolo Daimao.

29:13.758 --> 29:17.352
As such, the four of us Kaio,
from the north, south, east, and west,

29:17.362 --> 29:18.753
put our powers together,

29:18.763 --> 29:22.423
and sealed him up on a planet
at the far end of the galaxy.

29:22.433 --> 29:24.759
Sealed him up on a planet at
the far end of the galaxy?

29:24.769 --> 29:27.295
Goku, this is your fault.

29:27.305 --> 29:31.733
By wrecking my Kaio World
during the fight with Cell,

29:31.743 --> 29:35.770
and causing me to die,
the seal has been broken.

29:35.780 --> 29:39.440
But to think that Bojack would
set his sights on Earth!

29:39.450 --> 29:43.045
But then, <i>Kaio-sama,</i>
Earth still has Gohan!

29:51.129 --> 29:53.188
<i>K- Kuririn-san!</i>

30:01.806 --> 30:04.799
<i>Trunks-san! Kuririn-san!</i>

30:04.809 --> 30:08.643
Hey, kid, Earth is a nice planet, huh?

30:25.163 --> 30:27.597
What an incredible battle power!

30:30.168 --> 30:31.931
Gohan!

30:33.838 --> 30:38.866
A- are these the guys who killed
the four Galactic Warriors?

30:42.513 --> 30:46.745
From now on, this planet
belongs to <i>Bojack-sama.</i>

30:50.521 --> 30:51.846
Ridiculous!

30:51.856 --> 30:54.515
You think we're just going
to let you have it your way?

30:54.525 --> 30:58.186
<i>Bojack-sama</i> is invincible
throughout the galaxy!

30:58.196 --> 31:00.888
For Earth, the greatest planet
in the Northern Galaxy,

31:00.898 --> 31:02.790
most beautiful of all...

31:02.800 --> 31:06.861
...he is the most deserving
being to rule over it.

31:08.139 --> 31:11.466
We will kill anyone who defies him.

31:11.476 --> 31:14.570
Don't go downplaying us!

31:43.007 --> 31:44.474
You'll pay for this!

32:40.498 --> 32:42.156
Not bad, kid.

32:42.166 --> 32:45.026
But with that level of fighting power,
you'll never beat us,

32:45.036 --> 32:47.095
no matter how hard you try!

33:08.059 --> 33:09.116
This is going to be a problem!

33:09.126 --> 33:13.324
Gohan! Get angry!
Show them your true power!

33:34.151 --> 33:36.517
D- damn...

34:00.177 --> 34:01.644
<i>Piccolo-san!</i>

34:03.447 --> 34:07.144
Looks like someone with a
bit of a backbone showed up.

34:40.818 --> 34:42.478
Damn it!

34:46.157 --> 34:47.886
<i>Piccolo-san!</i>

34:55.166 --> 34:58.567
I'm going to get you back
good for what you did earlier!

35:44.482 --> 35:46.140
Dad!

35:46.150 --> 35:48.710
I'll defeat this one!

36:06.103 --> 36:07.866
<i>Vegeta-san...!</i>

36:31.128 --> 36:33.721
Dad had utterly lost the will
to fight after <i>Goku-san</i> died,

36:33.731 --> 36:38.759
and yet here he is, helping me
and <i>Gohan-san</i> during this crisis!

36:55.820 --> 36:58.414
Trunks, you keep out of this!

37:08.766 --> 37:11.759
Dad, you can't do any more
in your condition!

37:11.769 --> 37:15.096
I-I thought I told you
to stay out of this!

37:15.106 --> 37:17.098
<i>Piccolo-san!</i>

37:17.108 --> 37:22.307
D-don't concern yourself with me,
defeat that guy!

37:22.780 --> 37:23.940
Right!

37:44.135 --> 37:46.228
Damn!

37:47.471 --> 37:49.405
<i>Vegeta-san!</i>

37:50.808 --> 37:53.606
You'll have to face me!

37:59.483 --> 38:00.474
<i>Gohan-chan!</i>

38:00.484 --> 38:01.809
Trunks!

38:01.819 --> 38:04.745
W-wait! I still haven't
fastened my seatbelt!

38:04.755 --> 38:06.086
Start!

38:13.764 --> 38:15.254
Take this!

38:58.809 --> 39:04.405
Our telekinesis gives rise to a
containment zone, binding your power!

39:04.415 --> 39:09.182
The more you struggle,
the more your power drops!

39:17.094 --> 39:20.860
Kid, you fought well. I commend you.

39:56.800 --> 39:58.792
<i>Satan-san!</i>

39:58.802 --> 40:01.795
It looks like your life got
extended just a little bit.

40:01.805 --> 40:04.103
Damn you!

40:11.482 --> 40:14.747
<i>Kaio-sama,</i> ain't there
anything we can do!?

40:37.174 --> 40:40.868
Can you see your father
in the Next World yet?

40:40.878 --> 40:44.939
The two of you will enjoy the show
of carnage that is about to begin.

40:45.516 --> 40:47.450
<i>Kaio-sama!</i>

41:14.478 --> 41:17.276
F-Father...

41:24.488 --> 41:27.147
I can't take it any more!

41:27.157 --> 41:30.558
Goku! You're dead!

41:36.166 --> 41:37.963
<i>You ain't going to get
away with this!</i>

41:38.836 --> 41:40.326
What!?

41:49.513 --> 41:54.473
Gohan! Show him your true power!

41:57.187 --> 41:59.513
Father...

41:59.523 --> 42:04.984
Stop acting like such a pampered baby!
You have to protect the earth!

42:10.467 --> 42:12.458
Father!

42:23.480 --> 42:26.176
W-what was that just now!?

42:49.840 --> 42:53.367
Father saved me!

43:13.797 --> 43:18.461
And he said you weren't
going to get away with this!

43:21.472 --> 43:25.602
He told me to protect the earth!

44:00.177 --> 44:03.146
Bujin! Bido!

45:34.137 --> 45:36.799
Dammit!

45:59.830 --> 46:03.090
D-damn!

46:03.100 --> 46:07.093
How could a kid like
you do this to me!?

46:11.441 --> 46:14.434
And then... and then...

46:14.444 --> 46:17.607
...he told me to stop acting
like some pampered baby!

47:30.787 --> 47:33.113
Gohan, you did fine!

47:33.123 --> 47:36.684
Goku, you still acted
recklessly, huh?

47:37.794 --> 47:40.454
<i>Kaio-sama,</i> did I do something?

47:40.464 --> 47:44.491
Oh, I must have blinked,
so I can't be sure.

47:51.475 --> 47:55.138
"Satan saves the earth a
2nd time," huh?

47:55.812 --> 47:59.139
Just once, I'd like to give
him a good talking-to.

47:59.149 --> 48:01.541
It's okay, isn't it?

48:01.551 --> 48:05.078
There's no question that he did
help me out there, after all.

48:05.088 --> 48:09.024
In the end, he defended his
title of "World's Greatest Fool!"

48:14.097 --> 48:16.089
Father?

48:16.099 --> 48:18.759
Gohan, all things considered,
you were something else!

48:18.769 --> 48:20.293
You single-handedly defeated the guy

48:20.303 --> 48:23.096
that neither Piccolo nor Vegeta
could stand up to!

48:23.106 --> 48:25.432
It wasn't single-handed. Father...

48:25.442 --> 48:27.100
Goku came back to life!?

48:27.110 --> 48:29.770
I'm joking! I'm joking!

48:29.780 --> 48:33.440
Why, you scoundrel!
At a time like this!?

48:33.450 --> 48:39.184
"At the second Tenkaichi Grand Tournament,
you too can challenge Satan!"

48:40.351 --> 48:47.015
<i>You're moving on,</i>
<i>beyond the galaxy,</i>

48:47.025 --> 48:51.758
<i>Toward the land of light,</i>
<i>you're rising high!</i>

48:54.032 --> 49:01.029
<i>Summer brings its light
with it for us.</i>

49:01.039 --> 49:06.367
<i>It's new, and yet</i>
<i>for some reason, familiar.</i>

49:06.377 --> 49:15.376
<i>We feel the strong sunlight</i>
<i>hitting our cheeks,</i>

49:15.386 --> 49:24.052
<i>And our courage flows
through us now!</i>

49:24.062 --> 49:26.354
<i>Let's fly!</i>

49:26.364 --> 49:37.732
<i>The blue of the brightly shining sky</i>
<i>and sea swims within our eyes!</i>

49:37.742 --> 49:39.867
<i>Net sky!</i>

49:39.877 --> 49:51.012
<i>Raising our hands high, up to
the light, we connect with it!</i>

49:51.022 --> 49:57.518
<i>Some day, our smiles</i>
<i>will reach there, too.</i>

49:59.364 --> 50:06.027
<i>I'm moving on,</i>
<i>beyond the galaxy,</i>

50:06.037 --> 50:12.533
<i>Toward the land of light,</i>
<i>I'm rising high, rising high!</i>

50:19.050 --> 50:25.114
