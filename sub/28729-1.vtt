09:49.756 --> 09:50.889
This is the future.

09:50.891 --> 09:51.723
- Righteous.

09:51.725 --> 09:52.791
I got you.

09:52.793 --> 09:54.092
- Slow down partner.

09:56.897 --> 09:58.463
Three things.

09:58.465 --> 10:03.134
One, make sure everybody
knows about Oz.

10:04.204 --> 10:06.071
It's the best thing
in the market.

10:06.073 --> 10:09.374
Second thing, don't
get high here.

10:10.210 --> 10:11.509
If you wanna get loaded,

10:12.613 --> 10:15.580
see that third
light on the left?

10:15.582 --> 10:17.782
Go in the arts
studio, see my dude.

10:17.784 --> 10:18.817
That way it's safe.

10:21.588 --> 10:22.454
- Three?

10:25.125 --> 10:26.324
- One hit per person.

10:27.761 --> 10:29.461
There's six hits
in each canister.

10:30.631 --> 10:34.366
You spray, inhale, hold, exhale.

10:40.841 --> 10:42.273
One hit though.

10:42.275 --> 10:43.341
This stuff's potent.

10:44.344 --> 10:45.377
You won't need much.

10:46.346 --> 10:47.846
Next time, don't be so stupid.

10:47.848 --> 10:50.749
Don't come over
barking so loud, man.

10:52.185 --> 10:54.853
- How will I find you?

10:56.123 --> 10:58.657
- If you need to see me,
go see Bolo over the door.

10:58.659 --> 11:00.592
He'll plug you in, man.

11:02.629 --> 11:03.495
- Yo!

11:04.531 --> 11:05.997
Come on, come with me.

11:07.034 --> 11:07.832
- What the fuck is that?

11:07.834 --> 11:08.667
- It's that new-new.

11:08.669 --> 11:09.968
It's Oz.

11:09.970 --> 11:11.202
Y'all wanna get blazed?

11:12.506 --> 11:13.371
Come with me.

11:18.478 --> 11:21.446
(friends giggling)

11:26.953 --> 11:29.788
- [Narrator] Some people
just beg for salvation.

11:38.131 --> 11:43.201
(ambulance siren rings)
(man coughing)

11:50.577 --> 11:54.012
- Remember, one hit.

11:54.014 --> 11:55.714
Dude said this is potent.

12:04.424 --> 12:05.290
Fuck!

12:12.165 --> 12:14.499
(man coughs)

12:15.869 --> 12:20.672
(upbeat electronic music)
(friends giggling)

12:47.067 --> 12:48.800
- Why must I do this?

12:49.636 --> 12:51.369
Why must you make me?

12:55.242 --> 12:59.811
- [Narrator] Not being
able to separate the real.

12:59.813 --> 13:03.481
- [Man] This hurts me
more than it hurts you.

13:05.152 --> 13:09.554
- [Narrator] I could feel
it running through me.

13:09.556 --> 13:10.889
It's beyond me.

13:14.728 --> 13:16.394
(man yelps)

13:16.396 --> 13:18.396
I'm fulfilling a prophecy.

13:25.839 --> 13:29.040
To reveal the illusion
for what it is

13:32.078 --> 13:35.914
to destroy their fantasy,
destroy their dream.

13:42.989 --> 13:46.257
(man growls)

13:46.259 --> 13:47.992
I call it my destiny.

14:01.541 --> 14:04.509
(man yells)
I can't stand how they live.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.597
(man yells)

14:30.871 --> 14:32.403
- [Man] Grace and glory!

14:33.340 --> 14:38.409
You shall know!

14:42.582 --> 14:45.750
- [Narrator] Between
life and death,

14:45.752 --> 14:48.953
when you take it
upon piece by piece,

14:50.857 --> 14:52.457
there's nothing
left to stand on.

15:01.001 --> 15:05.970
- With the hands of
time, rest on the land.

15:08.375 --> 15:10.675
You shall not be
deceived my Lord.

15:15.916 --> 15:20.985
So I free and open up a
passage for new countries!

15:24.257 --> 15:27.692
For those who may not
learn their lessons.

15:40.407 --> 15:42.373
- Fucking shame what
happened to that girl.

15:42.375 --> 15:43.975
- Why am I here?

15:43.977 --> 15:45.543
- I need you undercover on this.

15:46.413 --> 15:48.046
This is in your wheelhouse.

15:49.549 --> 15:52.050
- I'm not a cop 'til I get
my shit together, remember?

15:52.052 --> 15:52.884
- I remember.

15:54.721 --> 15:56.754
Thought maybe you could
check your ego long enough

15:56.756 --> 15:58.589
to help us solve some crimes.

15:58.591 --> 15:59.958
- How am I gonna do that?

16:01.594 --> 16:02.627
- Your brother.

16:03.663 --> 16:04.629
I touch a nerve?

16:05.932 --> 16:06.731
Good.

16:08.568 --> 16:10.668
Same scene that
claimed your brother

16:10.670 --> 16:13.504
is hard at working
claiming other kids.

16:20.080 --> 16:21.546
You reinstated or not?

16:23.483 --> 16:25.717
(man sighs)

16:27.454 --> 16:28.319
- I'm done.

16:29.255 --> 16:30.755
What do you know?

16:30.757 --> 16:32.590
- This time last year,

16:32.592 --> 16:35.093
this Fusion Fest
came to town and

16:35.095 --> 16:37.261
we were left with
four mutilated bodies

16:37.263 --> 16:39.731
and double-digit ODs by
the end of the weekend.

16:41.034 --> 16:41.899
- I don't get it.

16:43.003 --> 16:44.635
ODs, maybe.

16:44.637 --> 16:47.705
Parties, where's the
connection to Mollywood?

16:48.775 --> 16:49.741
- What's Mollywood?

16:50.710 --> 16:52.310
- Are you serious?

16:52.312 --> 16:54.212
Mollywood is the club kids
alias for Fusion Fest.

16:54.214 --> 16:55.480
Weekend rave?

16:55.482 --> 16:57.115
It's like a convention
for party drugs.

17:01.054 --> 17:02.787
- Aye, we'll have to say it.

17:04.057 --> 17:05.490
- What now?

17:05.492 --> 17:06.691
- You and detective Shay.

17:08.128 --> 17:11.129
I know she's got your
back, but we got policies,

17:11.131 --> 17:13.631
strict fraternization policies.

17:13.633 --> 17:14.866
- Serge, come on!

17:16.169 --> 17:18.903
- With the Shay rumors
and the Bijou mess,

17:18.905 --> 17:20.371
you got two strikes.

17:21.508 --> 17:24.642
One more and I can't
keep you in the game.

17:25.645 --> 17:26.778
- I hear you.

17:32.652 --> 17:33.484
I'm out.

17:36.022 --> 17:39.290
(upbeat violin music)

18:19.933 --> 18:21.566
I don't believe it.

18:21.568 --> 18:22.733
What's up fresh?

18:22.735 --> 18:25.069
How you feeling, bro?

18:25.071 --> 18:25.870
Yes sir.

18:25.872 --> 18:26.904
Looking good, man.

18:26.906 --> 18:27.772
Holding it down as always.

18:27.774 --> 18:28.940
Hold it down.

18:29.742 --> 18:33.411
(man clears throat)

18:33.413 --> 18:34.879
Hello mami.

18:34.881 --> 18:35.913
Who's that?

18:35.915 --> 18:36.914
- Hey pretty boy.

18:36.916 --> 18:38.416
What you drinking?

18:38.418 --> 18:40.785
- I'm playing that
good nino tonight.

18:40.787 --> 18:41.953
- Yeah right.

18:41.955 --> 18:43.588
How long is that gonna last?

18:43.590 --> 18:44.789
(man chuckles)

18:44.791 --> 18:45.823
- All right, you got me.

18:45.825 --> 18:46.891
Bring me a beer.

18:46.893 --> 18:48.559
I'll nurse on that.

18:48.561 --> 18:49.393
- Okay.

18:53.099 --> 18:54.866
- How long we gonna
play this game?

18:55.902 --> 18:57.835
- What you talking about?

18:57.837 --> 18:59.303
- This.

18:59.305 --> 19:02.073
Come on, I see you all the time.

19:03.176 --> 19:06.677
I'm giving you the
go ahead all the time

19:07.480 --> 19:09.647
and you ain't made a move yet.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.382
- I didn't know
you was interested.

19:12.485 --> 19:13.351
- Your drink.

19:14.454 --> 19:15.353
- Thank you love.

19:16.689 --> 19:17.755
- [Woman] Excuse me!

19:20.126 --> 19:20.925
- I got it.

19:20.927 --> 19:21.826
- Yeah?

19:21.828 --> 19:23.361
You ain't gotta pay me boo.

19:23.363 --> 19:24.629
You know your money ain't
no good around here.

19:24.631 --> 19:25.930
I got you.

19:25.932 --> 19:27.265
(woman clears throat)

19:27.267 --> 19:28.032
I'm sorry boo.

19:28.034 --> 19:29.100
Is you thirsty?

19:29.102 --> 19:30.001
What's up?

19:30.003 --> 19:31.969
- Bring the young lady here a...

19:31.971 --> 19:33.871

19:33.873 --> 19:35.006

19:35.008 --> 19:36.007
- What did you say?

19:36.009 --> 19:37.041
- Nothing, nothing.

19:38.344 --> 19:39.944
Please, just bring
her her drink.

19:41.381 --> 19:44.148
- You need to control
your groupies.

19:44.150 --> 19:46.150
- No groupies around here girl.

19:46.152 --> 19:47.885
Just trying to do me.

19:47.887 --> 19:49.787
Do me a favor, chill

19:49.789 --> 19:51.222
I gotta go holla at

19:51.224 --> 19:52.456
Tell old girl to keep the tip.

19:52.458 --> 19:53.624
I'll be right back,

19:53.626 --> 19:54.458

19:59.132 --> 20:03.034

20:03.036 --> 20:04.135

Toast to that, man.

20:37.604 --> 20:39.170
I may jump on some of

20:39.172 --> 20:40.504
What's up with your

20:58.124 --> 20:59.190
(man laughs)

20:59.192 --> 21:00.691
- You right, bro.

21:00.693 --> 21:01.993

22:08.494 --> 22:10.594
Don't follow him, don't do shit.

22:10.596 --> 22:12.563
- We need to handle

22:14.434 --> 22:16.133

22:16.135 --> 22:17.034

22:17.036 --> 22:18.536
Don't fuck with him, man.

All right, 100.

22:30.616 --> 22:32.850

23:34.380 --> 23:36.947

23:37.884 --> 23:41.252
(upbeat hip hop music)

24:19.125 --> 24:21.058

24:34.407 --> 24:37.842
(upbeat electronic music)

24:40.413 --> 24:41.512

24:41.514 --> 24:43.347

24:43.349 --> 24:44.281

24:44.283 --> 24:45.950

24:45.952 --> 24:47.251
You missed the set.

24:48.588 --> 24:49.920
Today's been crazy, man.

24:51.090 --> 24:52.623
What's up with you, man?

24:52.625 --> 24:53.991
You went on tonight.

24:53.993 --> 24:54.792

24:54.794 --> 24:55.593
- Hell no, man.

24:55.595 --> 24:56.927
I'm the headliner.

24:56.929 --> 24:58.162
I close tomorrow night.

25:00.132 --> 25:01.832
- [Chase] Why am
I even here then?

25:02.535 --> 25:03.868
- Kick it.

25:03.870 --> 25:05.202
I'm only here 'til Monday.

25:05.204 --> 25:06.604
- [Chase] Kick it?

25:06.606 --> 25:09.173
- You didn't bring you
Bible again, did you?

25:09.175 --> 25:10.941
- [Chase] Funny, man.

25:13.646 --> 25:16.780
- You hear that
nonsense started again?

25:16.782 --> 25:17.715
- [Chase] What nonsense?

25:17.717 --> 25:19.450
What are you talking about, man?

25:19.452 --> 25:22.453
- The dead kids,
just like last year.

25:22.455 --> 25:23.521
- [Chase] Dead kids?

25:25.324 --> 25:28.692
- Yo dude, you wanna
stay away from her, man.

25:28.694 --> 25:30.194
She's trouble.

25:30.196 --> 25:31.662
- [Chase] That's okay.

25:31.664 --> 25:33.330
That's just the way I like it.

25:33.332 --> 25:34.798
(men laugh)

25:34.800 --> 25:36.133
- That's my boy.

25:36.135 --> 25:37.701
All right man.

25:37.703 --> 25:38.669
- [Chase] I got a special
delivery this evening.

25:38.671 --> 25:40.538
(men laugh)
I'll see you guys.

25:40.540 --> 25:42.039
- You crazy, Chase.

25:47.580 --> 25:49.146
- [Chase] Chase.

25:49.148 --> 25:50.648
- What's up with your guy?

25:51.918 --> 25:53.217
- What do you mean?

25:53.219 --> 25:55.152
- I saw him the other
day outside of the club.

25:56.255 --> 25:58.756
Gave me the creeps.

25:58.758 --> 26:00.224
- He's cool.

26:00.226 --> 26:03.727
Just the everyday club kid
turned Jesus freak, you know?

26:03.729 --> 26:04.728
- Jesus freak?

26:06.766 --> 26:11.835
- When his parents died, he
became all God all the time.

26:12.271 --> 26:12.970
- Really?

26:14.173 --> 26:16.740
(woman laughs)

26:19.011 --> 26:23.814
- [Chase] The Lord is my
shepherd and I shall not want.

26:41.601 --> 26:42.900
- Hey.

26:42.902 --> 26:44.902
How you gonna leave me?

26:44.904 --> 26:46.036
- [Chase] I ain't leave you.

26:46.038 --> 26:48.872
I'm just letting you rest.

26:48.874 --> 26:52.242
We got things to do.

26:52.244 --> 26:55.212
(mysterious music)

27:04.824 --> 27:05.823
- What the fuck?

27:05.825 --> 27:07.224
Are you a priest or something?

27:07.226 --> 27:08.892
- [Chase] If I was a priest,

27:08.894 --> 27:11.562
you wouldn't of met
me in a club, right?

27:11.564 --> 27:13.764
- What do you do?

27:13.766 --> 27:16.567
- [Chase] I design new world
entertainment materials.

27:16.569 --> 27:20.604
In lamest terms,
I'm a drug maker.

27:20.606 --> 27:23.407
- This is why you got all
of the good shit, huh?

27:24.610 --> 27:26.810
- [Chase] I'm glad
you catch on fast.

27:26.812 --> 27:28.245
- What's this?

27:28.247 --> 27:30.147
- [Chase] It's an applicator.

27:30.149 --> 27:31.782
- What does it do?

27:31.784 --> 27:36.020
- [Chase] It's used to
inject drugs...vaginally.

27:39.992 --> 27:41.692
- Shut the fuck up.

27:42.928 --> 27:45.663
You're saying that I can get
high through my juice box?

27:46.766 --> 27:48.699
Are you fucking kidding me?

27:48.701 --> 27:50.000
- [Chase] Juice box.

27:50.002 --> 27:52.770
(woman laughs)

27:58.978 --> 28:00.511
What are you doing over there?

28:00.513 --> 28:01.378
- Come on.

28:02.281 --> 28:03.881
Come on, put it in me, please?

28:05.685 --> 28:07.017
I gotta try this.

28:14.393 --> 28:15.959
- [Chase] You've been
waiting a long time

28:15.961 --> 28:17.194
for this moment, haven't you?

28:17.196 --> 28:19.797
(woman hums)

28:21.300 --> 28:22.966
I want you to close your eyes.

28:25.638 --> 28:28.072
(woman moans)

28:38.084 --> 28:41.919
Just let that sink in.

28:41.921 --> 28:43.053
Enjoy.

28:46.025 --> 28:48.692
You'll try anything, huh?

28:48.694 --> 28:50.160
- Hell yeah.

28:50.162 --> 28:53.097
(woman giggles)

28:53.099 --> 28:54.832
You gonna fuck me or what?

28:59.004 --> 29:02.072
- [Chase] Girls like you
like it rough, don't you?

29:02.074 --> 29:04.274
You like it nice and deep.

29:06.045 --> 29:08.145
Why don't we start, softly?

29:15.588 --> 29:17.154
Definitely oh what.

29:20.426 --> 29:22.493
Some good for the flesh.

29:26.632 --> 29:30.100
(upbeat electronic music)

30:13.579 --> 30:14.812
- Hell yeah!

30:14.814 --> 30:16.146
I was in the club man,
kicking it with J,

30:16.148 --> 30:17.414
and he dutched it out
with my peoples, man.

30:17.416 --> 30:18.248
Mo, what's cracking?

30:18.250 --> 30:19.283
What's happening baby?

30:19.285 --> 30:20.284
How you feeling?

30:20.286 --> 30:21.351
Yes sir.

30:23.756 --> 30:25.022
Boss.

30:25.024 --> 30:25.789
The best baby.

30:25.791 --> 30:26.790

You need to finish school, man.

30:34.967 --> 30:36.300
Damn man, finish school.

30:36.302 --> 30:37.935
You look like a grown

30:56.388 --> 30:58.121

31:51.911 --> 31:53.710
You know me, that

33:23.102 --> 33:25.135
That was a killer shot, man.

33:25.137 --> 33:26.003
Killed it.

33:36.648 --> 33:40.350
(upbeat electronic music)

33:53.165 --> 33:54.798

33:54.800 --> 33:55.932
- God dammit!

33:57.736 --> 34:00.470
Dude, you got a fucking problem?

34:00.472 --> 34:02.472
- Yeah, I need some attention.

34:02.474 --> 34:04.174
- You see me working?

34:04.176 --> 34:04.975
It can wait.

34:06.812 --> 34:07.911
- I think not.

34:09.214 --> 34:11.381
- Man, I've known
you for 20 years.

34:12.151 --> 34:13.750
That shit doesn't scare me.

34:15.687 --> 34:16.753
- True.

34:18.057 --> 34:20.157
For 20 years, I've known
you to be a little bitch.

34:21.326 --> 34:22.659
How's that fact
gonna work for you

34:22.661 --> 34:24.027
when I let you stew in
the county all weekend

34:24.029 --> 34:25.462
for not cooperating?

34:27.733 --> 34:29.299
You gonna miss your big weekend.

34:33.739 --> 34:37.107
- Aye, why don't you guys
step out, give us a second,

34:37.109 --> 34:38.508

34:38.510 --> 34:39.509
- [Zack] Good call.

34:44.383 --> 34:45.882
(man whistles)

34:45.884 --> 34:48.852
Hey girl, I see you.

34:48.854 --> 34:51.154
(man laughs)

35:05.571 --> 35:09.673
Answer me one question and
I'll be out of your hair.

35:12.644 --> 35:13.977
- Hurry.

35:13.979 --> 35:15.846
- You come back
home to the spin,

35:16.982 --> 35:18.248
there's a trill
of bodies lined up

35:18.250 --> 35:19.850
from the airport to the club.

35:22.154 --> 35:23.019
Why is that?

35:26.492 --> 35:28.658
- Now I know you've
lost it 'cause

35:29.795 --> 35:31.128
I don't have a clue what
you're talking about.

35:31.130 --> 35:32.429
- The dead kids Rush.

35:32.431 --> 35:33.997
Don't act brand
new with me, bro!

35:34.766 --> 35:37.467
- Z, this is Chicago!

35:39.304 --> 35:41.972
There's a murder every
commercial break.

35:42.841 --> 35:43.974
How's that my fault?

35:52.351 --> 35:53.917
- I'm not saying that it is.

35:54.853 --> 35:57.420
You can't be as
ignorant as you look.

35:57.422 --> 36:00.590
I know you seen something,
heard something.

36:07.432 --> 36:09.366
I know this is bad for business,

36:09.368 --> 36:12.068
may even hurt the brand
for you to acknowledge it,

36:13.372 --> 36:15.038
hell, you might
even be involved!

36:18.477 --> 36:19.409
- Keep dreaming.

36:20.612 --> 36:23.046
Unlike you, I made it.

36:23.882 --> 36:25.949
I didn't have to quit and get a

36:25.951 --> 36:27.918
nine to five to pay my bills.

36:31.056 --> 36:33.056
(man chuckles)

36:33.058 --> 36:33.990
- [Zack] Really?

36:33.992 --> 36:35.959
(man laughs)

36:35.961 --> 36:38.094
- Yeah, really.

36:38.964 --> 36:40.463
I'm on top of the mountain.

36:41.900 --> 36:44.201
I wouldn't jeopardize
that for shit.

36:47.172 --> 36:49.773
- Somebody doesn't share
your point-of-view, bro.

36:51.310 --> 36:52.709
All I'm trying to say is,

36:58.150 --> 36:59.583
they either hiding behind you,

37:02.521 --> 37:04.321
or they trying to
knock you off, bro.

37:06.658 --> 37:07.490
You feel me?

37:19.438 --> 37:20.737
- Time's up toy cop.

37:21.773 --> 37:22.806
I gotta work.

37:26.945 --> 37:29.713
- If you have plans to
leave after the fest, don't.

37:29.715 --> 37:31.047
(man laughs)

37:31.049 --> 37:33.149
- What, you gonna get
a warrant to stop me?

37:34.219 --> 37:35.919
- You should only be so lucky.

37:53.272 --> 37:55.538
- Stop, he did not.

37:55.540 --> 37:57.307
You have to tell him.

38:00.479 --> 38:04.281
- [Chase] Hey, from last
night, right, the fest?

38:04.283 --> 38:05.081
- Yeah.

38:05.083 --> 38:06.549
You know Rush?

38:06.551 --> 38:07.384
- [Chase] Come on.

38:07.386 --> 38:09.085
That's my dude.

38:09.087 --> 38:10.287
You guys going tonight?

38:10.289 --> 38:11.087
- We want to.

38:11.089 --> 38:12.722
We couldn't get tickets.

38:13.892 --> 38:16.259
- [Chase] I might be the
key to your salvation.

38:16.261 --> 38:17.093
- Sweet.

38:17.095 --> 38:18.194
You got tickets?

38:19.731 --> 38:22.265
- [Chase] I'm like a VIP ticket.

38:22.267 --> 38:24.134
- Dude, don't fuck with us.

38:24.136 --> 38:26.136
We really wanna go to Mollywood.

38:26.138 --> 38:29.806
- Seriously, we'd
do anything to go.

38:29.808 --> 38:30.807
- [Chase] Anything?

38:33.445 --> 38:34.778
We'll see.

38:34.780 --> 38:36.346
- Sweet.

38:36.348 --> 38:37.647
Why don't you swing by
our place for a pre-game?

38:37.649 --> 38:38.448
Give me your phone.

38:38.450 --> 38:39.416
I'll put my number in.

38:44.356 --> 38:45.722
- Think we can meet Rush?

38:46.958 --> 38:48.925
- [Chase] I don't see why not.

38:48.927 --> 38:51.361
Anything's possible
in life, right?

38:51.363 --> 38:52.362
- Yes it is.

38:55.200 --> 38:56.399
- We did say anything.

38:57.469 --> 39:00.537
(girls giggle)

39:00.539 --> 39:03.306
- [Narrator] That's the
problem with the culture today.

39:03.308 --> 39:06.176
They're all living for pleasure.

39:10.449 --> 39:11.514
- You back, huh?

39:12.384 --> 39:14.951
- Yeah until this
is paying me again.

39:14.953 --> 39:16.720
- I though you
needed the time off.

39:18.957 --> 39:20.690
What'd he tell you
to get you back?

39:23.995 --> 39:24.861
- My brother.

39:29.401 --> 39:30.400
- I knew it.

39:36.241 --> 39:39.309
- Let me show you this
picture real quick.

39:42.981 --> 39:45.382
Girl from Mollywood,
Logan Square last year.

39:45.384 --> 39:46.516
- Yeah?

39:46.518 --> 39:47.717
- Definitely the same guy.

39:48.720 --> 39:50.353
- What makes you say that?

39:50.355 --> 39:53.223
- Look at the gashes
around her upper torso.

39:53.225 --> 39:54.724
See?

39:54.726 --> 39:57.427
It's like he has to build rage
in order to finish the job.

39:57.429 --> 39:58.328
- Like a trigger.

40:00.332 --> 40:01.431
- Exactly.

40:05.237 --> 40:06.903
- [Woman] Can you put
this on me, please?

40:06.905 --> 40:07.771
- Yeah.

40:25.524 --> 40:29.959
- Listen, I don't want you to
make this a personal thing,

40:29.961 --> 40:31.094
do you understand me?

40:32.431 --> 40:33.463
Do you get it?

40:39.404 --> 40:41.971
I don't wanna lose you again.

40:43.108 --> 40:44.207
- I didn't knew you cared.

40:44.209 --> 40:45.008
- I do.

40:47.479 --> 40:51.381
It's just been hard to get
through your fucking fan club.

40:51.383 --> 40:52.715
- Don't talk like that.

40:53.752 --> 40:55.452
- Whoa, that's perfect.

40:55.454 --> 40:57.687
Now I got me some
blackmail material.

40:59.224 --> 41:00.623
- Go to hell Mertelli.

41:01.960 --> 41:03.927
- What if they wand
her at the door?

41:03.929 --> 41:05.562
- Don't worry, I got it.

41:05.564 --> 41:08.998
(upbeat electronic music)

41:16.775 --> 41:18.641
(girls giggle)

41:18.643 --> 41:20.810
- [Chase] Easy money, what's up?

41:20.812 --> 41:21.744
- All good.

41:21.746 --> 41:23.279
- [Chase] Good to see you, man.

41:23.281 --> 41:26.015
Listen, I got that next
generation right now on deck.

41:26.017 --> 41:27.851
Keep your people on
point, let them know.

41:27.853 --> 41:28.952
Next week, hit me up.

41:28.954 --> 41:30.753
You gonna see.

41:30.755 --> 41:32.689
- That's what I'm gonna
tell my peeps too.

41:32.691 --> 41:33.623
Good pimpin'.

41:33.625 --> 41:35.892
- [Chase] That's what's up.

41:37.696 --> 41:38.628
- Hey you.

41:38.630 --> 41:39.729
- [Chase] Hi.

41:40.866 --> 41:42.532
Where's your friend I
saw you with last time?

41:42.534 --> 41:44.934
- Work, but we're still
having the after party.

41:46.137 --> 41:47.604
You still coming by, right?

41:48.440 --> 41:49.606
- [Chase] If you're lucky.

41:51.042 --> 41:53.343
Who's your friend over there?

41:53.345 --> 41:54.210
- That's my girl.

41:57.649 --> 41:58.681
Don't forget to bring gifts.

42:03.688 --> 42:05.522
- [Chase] I always do.

42:06.791 --> 42:07.857
- We're set.

42:24.643 --> 42:29.712
(upbeat hip hop music)
(crowd cheering)

42:52.871 --> 42:54.337
- Are you sure you have to go?

42:54.339 --> 42:55.104
- Yeah.

42:55.106 --> 42:56.739
I have to work tomorrow.

42:56.741 --> 42:58.541
- Okay, but you'll be back
tomorrow night, right?

42:58.543 --> 42:59.342
- I'll see.

42:59.344 --> 43:00.610
It all depends on work.

43:00.612 --> 43:02.011
- It's gonna be so much fun.

43:02.013 --> 43:03.880
- I hope to get there,
but at the end of the day,

43:03.882 --> 43:04.914
we had a good time tonight.

43:04.916 --> 43:06.549
- I hope you did.

43:06.551 --> 43:07.584
- By the way, I want you
to be safe tonight, okay?

43:07.586 --> 43:08.418
- You too.

43:09.721 --> 43:11.287
- Hey, be safe.

43:11.289 --> 43:12.355
- I will.

43:12.357 --> 43:13.156
Chill.

43:20.966 --> 43:22.098
- [Chase] Good evening.

43:23.268 --> 43:25.535
Chase from the coffee shop.

43:25.537 --> 43:27.937
It's amazing how the
universe works, right?

43:27.939 --> 43:30.673
The law of attraction is always
right there in your hand.

43:34.980 --> 43:37.647
(woman giggles)

43:50.829 --> 43:53.763
- [Chase] Anything's
possible in life, right?

43:53.765 --> 43:56.899
(man grunts)

43:56.901 --> 43:57.800
- Putting a late on in, aye?

43:57.802 --> 43:59.702
- Yeah man, releasing anxiety.

44:03.675 --> 44:05.274
This club shit is
messing with my head.

44:05.276 --> 44:06.909
- That's what I heard.

44:06.911 --> 44:07.644
You be easy.

44:07.646 --> 44:08.811
I'm out.

44:08.813 --> 44:09.846
Lock up behind you.

44:09.848 --> 44:10.980
- Will do.

44:11.783 --> 44:12.649
Hey Cody.

44:15.086 --> 44:16.185
Thank you.

44:16.187 --> 44:17.053
- Yeah.

44:37.008 --> 44:39.676
- [Chase] They say the youth
is wasted on the young!

44:41.980 --> 44:44.080
My solution to it is...

44:46.685 --> 44:51.754
(man breathing heavily)
(dangerous music)

44:57.128 --> 44:59.696
(upbeat music)

45:05.403 --> 45:08.905
- [Chase] I have been
commissioned to do your worth.

45:08.907 --> 45:11.240
(man growls)

45:13.411 --> 45:15.778
To clean the devil's plate.

45:18.216 --> 45:20.783
(upbeat music)

45:25.890 --> 45:28.124
- [Man] Your bro isn't here!

45:35.500 --> 45:37.934
(man yells)

45:43.908 --> 45:46.175
- [Chase] Say I
surrender my spirit and

45:46.177 --> 45:50.113
body to the Lord now.

45:50.115 --> 45:51.247
Say it!

45:53.351 --> 45:56.018
(woman yells)

46:02.594 --> 46:03.860
Say it!

46:03.862 --> 46:05.361
- Please!

46:05.363 --> 46:09.198
- [Chase] Say I turn my will,
spirit, and body to the Lord!

46:09.200 --> 46:10.199
- No, please!

46:10.201 --> 46:11.300
Please!

46:12.537 --> 46:17.607
(men groaning)
(upbeat music)

46:23.548 --> 46:25.548
- Una pregunta?

46:25.550 --> 46:26.949
Bijou sent you?

46:29.254 --> 46:31.120
Bijou sent you motherfucker?

46:31.122 --> 46:36.192
- Yeah, he sent me nigga!

46:37.162 --> 46:39.829
(woman yelling)

46:41.266 --> 46:44.567
- [Chase] Who needs
eyes without vision?

46:45.303 --> 46:48.137
(woman weeping)

46:48.139 --> 46:51.541
For a blessing and
vessel and backhand!

46:52.811 --> 46:53.876
God's plan.

46:55.246 --> 47:00.216
May you understand I am the
gift, I am your salvation!

47:02.487 --> 47:06.155
You will be freed
for the Lord says,

47:06.157 --> 47:10.193
the good word says those
who have set off flesh

47:10.195 --> 47:13.229
of death and violent
towards the Lord,

47:14.766 --> 47:18.734
with those who are set on
spirit are free from peace.

47:28.313 --> 47:29.745
- [Narrator] Amen.

47:30.882 --> 47:33.749
Lord, they know
not what they do.

47:35.720 --> 47:38.421
(woman yells)

47:44.696 --> 47:47.263
(man groaning)

47:54.305 --> 47:55.371
- Did you say Molly?

47:59.978 --> 48:01.477
Tell me about Brianna.

48:03.381 --> 48:05.882
(man groaning)

48:06.718 --> 48:08.084
Tell me about Brianna.

48:16.594 --> 48:19.428
(man groaning)

48:20.565 --> 48:22.598
- [Man] Here's the part
I can't understand.

48:22.600 --> 48:23.866
- Help me!

48:23.868 --> 48:25.968
- [Man] Why so sloppy
with the red hand?

48:27.238 --> 48:29.438
It's like you lost control.

48:32.377 --> 48:33.576
- [Chase] Bless it on the!

48:36.214 --> 48:37.680
You understand?

48:37.682 --> 48:38.648
Understand?

48:39.717 --> 48:40.683
You get it?

48:49.727 --> 48:51.193
Nothing is free!

48:52.563 --> 48:54.530
Deduction's not free!

49:23.294 --> 49:24.160
- How bad?

49:49.921 --> 49:51.721
- I've never, ever
seen it that bad.

49:53.624 --> 49:54.623
I'm at a lost for words.

49:54.625 --> 49:55.524
- I'm not.

49:55.526 --> 49:56.726
This motherfucker's mine!

49:59.163 --> 50:02.531
- Serge, you did check on the
victim at the hospital, right?

50:03.301 --> 50:04.633
- What victims?

50:04.635 --> 50:07.803
- The girl that the neighbor
found on the street.

50:07.805 --> 50:09.905
They said she might
be a roommate in here.

50:10.842 --> 50:11.841
- I told you!

50:14.112 --> 50:15.611
I told you!

50:15.613 --> 50:18.681
(suspenseful music)

51:32.790 --> 51:34.590
- [Narrator] I am
the instrument,

51:36.461 --> 51:41.130
the salvation, the life, the
death, the future, the present.

51:46.137 --> 51:51.207
I am nothing except for alone
in the hands of your blood.

51:56.647 --> 51:58.581
- Look what I have brought you!

51:58.583 --> 52:01.117
- [Narrator] I live to open
the doors of the hearts,

52:02.286 --> 52:04.854
to destroy Satan's prison.

52:07.258 --> 52:11.527
- Please God, I sacrifice
my life in your name!

52:12.830 --> 52:17.666
- [Narrator] I live to
be a catalyst of change,

52:19.937 --> 52:21.837
even to my own self-destruction.

52:21.839 --> 52:23.839
- God, hear me!

52:23.841 --> 52:25.040
Listen now!

52:30.414 --> 52:31.247
Feel me!

52:33.818 --> 52:36.385
Let me breathe Lord, I ask you!

52:45.596 --> 52:46.729
- I'm so sorry.

52:50.301 --> 52:51.167
We're on it.

52:53.671 --> 52:55.004
Yes.

52:55.006 --> 52:56.071
Okay.

52:58.009 --> 52:59.074
Thanks.

53:01.479 --> 53:02.278
Damn!

53:03.314 --> 53:04.380
- Who was that?

53:04.382 --> 53:05.881
- The girl's mother.

53:05.883 --> 53:07.049
- Any info?

53:07.051 --> 53:08.517
- A little.

53:08.519 --> 53:12.354
The other victim was a
roommate, Brianna Tionni,

53:12.356 --> 53:13.989
been friends since grade school.

53:13.991 --> 53:15.691
- And the guy?

53:15.693 --> 53:18.661
- She didn't know him, but
did say she was concerned with

53:18.663 --> 53:20.196
how much they had been
throwing themselves

53:20.198 --> 53:25.401
into the club kids
scene, especially
obsessed with your boy.

53:25.403 --> 53:26.001
- Rush.

53:26.003 --> 53:27.536
- Rush.

53:27.538 --> 53:28.671
I don't know.

53:28.673 --> 53:30.039
I don't know what's next,

53:30.041 --> 53:31.740
but we gotta hurry up
and figure something out.

53:31.742 --> 53:35.077
- Is it time to take
the gloves off now, huh?

53:35.079 --> 53:36.145
By the book even now?

53:36.147 --> 53:37.179
- Easy!

53:37.181 --> 53:37.980
- Let me go!

53:37.982 --> 53:38.747
- Easy!

53:38.749 --> 53:39.548
- Let me go!

53:39.550 --> 53:40.349
I was just with her!

53:40.351 --> 53:41.250
She's just a girl!

53:41.252 --> 53:42.251
- Yes.
- I know.

53:43.654 --> 53:44.620
- How's Angie?

53:55.833 --> 53:56.665
Fuck!

54:23.127 --> 54:24.260
- You need that?

54:35.806 --> 54:37.573
Aye Serge, I'm out!

54:37.575 --> 54:38.474
- Zack, wait!

54:38.476 --> 54:39.341
Where to?

54:42.613 --> 54:43.679
- You don't wanna know.

54:48.152 --> 54:51.854
(upbeat electronic music)

54:56.494 --> 54:57.826
- Give me five.

55:01.732 --> 55:03.198
- You know where
this comes from?

55:06.170 --> 55:07.036
Let me show you.

55:09.407 --> 55:10.739
From her.

55:10.741 --> 55:11.907
See that bloody mess?

55:13.511 --> 55:15.277
That's where your
eyeball's supposed to be.

55:15.279 --> 55:18.814
Somebody burned her eyeball
while she was still alive.

55:18.816 --> 55:20.516
Can you imagine
that type of pain?

55:22.086 --> 55:24.320
Can the almighty Rush the DJ,

55:24.322 --> 55:25.821
be bothered to talk to me now?

55:25.823 --> 55:28.223
- I don't know what
you want from me.

55:29.193 --> 55:30.292
I don't know anything.

55:30.294 --> 55:31.393
- Bullshit Rush!

55:32.430 --> 55:33.662
These are kids, man.

55:33.664 --> 55:35.998
Fuck that man, these
are you fucking fans!

55:37.802 --> 55:39.535
This means she was
here to see you.

55:40.438 --> 55:42.371
- You think I don't care?

55:42.373 --> 55:44.573
You know how much this
is fucking with me?

55:47.144 --> 55:51.847
I make music to make people
happy, not for kids to get hurt.

55:52.883 --> 55:53.982
- You ever think
carrying crates would

55:53.984 --> 55:55.284
take you all over the world?

55:59.690 --> 56:00.556
- Not really.

56:01.692 --> 56:04.059
Could've been the same for you.

56:04.061 --> 56:06.562
You're almost as
good as your brother.

56:10.668 --> 56:12.034
- What you mean almost?

56:15.373 --> 56:16.305
Step aside, man.

56:16.307 --> 56:17.406
Come on.

56:18.309 --> 56:21.977
(upbeat electronic music)

56:24.048 --> 56:25.647
- The new stuff right here.

56:28.252 --> 56:32.321
- I couldn't do this fake,
soulless, techno bullshit, man.

56:32.323 --> 56:33.355
- You just gotta
give it a chance.

56:33.357 --> 56:34.990
- Hell no.

56:34.992 --> 56:38.427
Old school house 'til I die,
man, you know what I mean?

56:41.499 --> 56:44.733
- Yo Z, I know it's
been awhile but,

56:48.406 --> 56:51.507
I really want you to know
how sorry I am about Tony.

56:55.513 --> 56:56.445
He was special, man.

56:57.448 --> 56:58.647
Everybody loved him.

57:00.084 --> 57:01.517
Man, could he rock a party.

57:05.589 --> 57:07.523
- He could, huh?

57:07.525 --> 57:10.259
- I still got the old A
to Z mix tape y'all made.

57:10.261 --> 57:11.126
- You serious?

57:13.564 --> 57:17.266
Yo, does this mean I
could count on you?

57:19.570 --> 57:20.669
- Whatever man.

57:22.440 --> 57:24.506
I just need this shit to end.

57:28.112 --> 57:28.977
- Good.

57:29.980 --> 57:31.313
It's real good
'cause all in the kid

57:31.315 --> 57:32.915
that the killer's
still in the know,

57:32.917 --> 57:34.550
maybe even inside
your inner circle.

57:34.552 --> 57:36.418
(phone vibrates)

57:36.420 --> 57:37.453
- What?

57:37.455 --> 57:38.253
- Yo, I gotta rush out.

57:38.255 --> 57:39.121
I'll catch you later.

57:47.298 --> 57:48.297
- What's wrong with you?

57:48.299 --> 57:49.665
- Ran into your guy Chase.

57:50.968 --> 57:52.501
- And?

57:52.503 --> 57:53.635
- And?

57:55.306 --> 57:56.605
Dude is strange as hell.

57:56.607 --> 57:59.475
I'm telling you, every
time he comes around,

57:59.477 --> 58:00.576
shit gets weird.

58:02.646 --> 58:06.582
- April, he's like my brother.

58:09.253 --> 58:12.120
Chase moved in with my
family when we were 15,

58:12.122 --> 58:14.756
right after his parents got
killed by a drunk driver,

58:15.926 --> 58:17.526
an accident that caused
him to have almost

58:17.528 --> 58:21.330
everything below his
waist reattached.

58:24.201 --> 58:25.367
- I didn't know that.

58:30.608 --> 58:33.342
- It was his inheritance that
paid for my DJ equipment,

58:34.545 --> 58:36.278
pay for the parties
we first threw,

58:37.615 --> 58:41.049
pay for the flights,
the planes, the hotels.

58:42.186 --> 58:46.355
If it wasn't for him, I
wouldn't even be here.

58:47.658 --> 58:51.293
- Still Rush, something
is not right, okay?

58:52.796 --> 58:55.998
I went up to him and asked
him if he knew that one girl

58:56.000 --> 58:57.533
and he got in my
face and told me

58:57.535 --> 59:01.537
to get the hell away from him.

59:01.539 --> 59:02.404
- What?

59:02.406 --> 59:03.539
- I'm telling you.

59:04.909 --> 59:07.543
I truthfully believe he's got
something to do with this.

59:09.013 --> 59:11.213
(man chuckles)

59:11.215 --> 59:13.081
- That doesn't sound
like him at all.

59:14.852 --> 59:16.718
He's the most
religious dude I know.

59:18.589 --> 59:20.756
He's all fanatical about it.

59:23.427 --> 59:24.459
- Suit yourself.

59:27.398 --> 59:29.631
I warned you, more than once.

59:31.902 --> 59:33.669
- [Narrator] To
redeem is spared.

59:34.438 --> 59:36.738
Send it back to the great maker.

59:36.740 --> 59:38.273
- [Cop] Rosen?

59:38.275 --> 59:40.242
- Yeah, I'm Rosen.

59:40.244 --> 59:41.410
- [Cop] Sergeant
wants you upstairs

59:41.412 --> 59:42.778
immediately for a transport.

59:42.780 --> 59:44.680
I got you covered for
the rest of the night.

59:44.682 --> 59:45.681
- Damn man.

59:45.683 --> 59:47.349
I get out in an hour.

59:47.351 --> 59:48.684
- [Cop] I'm sure
I'll release you

59:48.686 --> 59:50.619
as soon as they
get in the county.

59:50.621 --> 59:51.453
Better put a step on it.

59:51.455 --> 59:52.955
He's waiting.

59:52.957 --> 59:53.822
- Later.

59:54.925 --> 59:55.791
- Later.

1:00:10.074 --> 1:00:12.941
God's been calling
for them and I

1:00:14.411 --> 1:00:18.814
am here to make sure that
call is delivered properly.

1:00:23.587 --> 1:00:25.120
I know you've been awaiting me.

1:00:27.324 --> 1:00:31.126
Good morning sunshine.
(woman hyperventilating)

1:00:31.128 --> 1:00:31.994
Yes.

1:00:33.597 --> 1:00:35.897
(man hushes)

1:00:37.668 --> 1:00:42.170
Feel your mortality and
realize you are eternal.

1:00:42.172 --> 1:00:46.642
God's been calling for you and
I'm here to be the deliverer.

1:00:50.114 --> 1:00:53.181
They say when one door
closes, another door opens.

1:00:55.085 --> 1:00:58.020
God has sent me
to redeliver you.

1:01:00.090 --> 1:01:01.790
You feel it?

1:01:01.792 --> 1:01:04.660
It's all an illusion,
you understand?

1:01:04.662 --> 1:01:09.398
Everything that you keep
holding on to so desperately,

1:01:10.968 --> 1:01:12.934
the skin that you're stuck in,

1:01:14.104 --> 1:01:16.104
you've been stuck
in for way too long.

1:01:16.106 --> 1:01:19.508
Take my hand.
(woman weeping)

1:01:21.512 --> 1:01:22.528
It's okay.

1:01:22.529 --> 1:01:23.545
That's the problem
with society today.

1:01:25.149 --> 1:01:29.451
Most are so concerned with
the flesh that they live in,

1:01:29.453 --> 1:01:32.621
they don't even
see their spirit.

1:01:32.623 --> 1:01:35.290
So sad.
(woman crying)

1:01:35.292 --> 1:01:40.362
If we only knew what we
had in us because of God.

1:01:41.999 --> 1:01:44.066
(man hushes)

1:01:44.068 --> 1:01:46.702
My child, God is calling you.

1:01:49.039 --> 1:01:51.106
Your future is very bright.

1:01:52.543 --> 1:01:55.177
God has been waiting for you.

1:01:55.179 --> 1:01:56.144
Are you ready?

1:01:57.047 --> 1:02:02.084
(man hushes)
(woman crying)

1:02:03.554 --> 1:02:07.255
I want you to close your eyes
and ask the Lord to wait.

1:02:11.228 --> 1:02:15.230
Close your eyes and say
hello to the new life

1:02:16.533 --> 1:02:18.500
which you have been awaiting.

1:02:18.502 --> 1:02:21.136
(woman gasping)

1:02:53.270 --> 1:02:54.269
- Hey!

1:02:54.271 --> 1:02:55.137
Wait!

1:02:58.142 --> 1:03:01.810
- [Cop] You ready for
divine intervention?

1:03:02.980 --> 1:03:05.180
Shut the fuck up
is what God said!

1:03:10.254 --> 1:03:13.288
- Aye boss, they
almost ready for you.

1:03:26.503 --> 1:03:27.369
- Who?

1:03:28.572 --> 1:03:30.338
- [Man] It's the bag.

1:03:40.984 --> 1:03:41.850
- Go up.

1:03:44.688 --> 1:03:46.354
Where the fuck
you get this from?

1:03:46.356 --> 1:03:49.958
- Some fucked nigga on
79th, but he verified.

1:03:49.960 --> 1:03:51.359
- Why the fuck it ain't pink?

1:03:52.863 --> 1:03:55.063
- That's all he had right
now, but that's his best.

1:04:24.661 --> 1:04:26.061
- Why the fuck you
already running me?

1:04:26.063 --> 1:04:31.132
What the fuck?
(upbeat music)

1:05:14.444 --> 1:05:15.310
- Really?

1:05:18.682 --> 1:05:20.615
- Boss, what's
taking him so long?

1:05:23.387 --> 1:05:25.287
- Go fucking check on him!

1:05:25.289 --> 1:05:26.588
- Fucking rookies, man.

1:05:36.300 --> 1:05:38.066
Yo, fuck nigga,
what you doing man?

1:05:38.068 --> 1:05:39.134
We gotta go!

1:05:41.071 --> 1:05:44.506
(upbeat electronic music)

1:05:57.487 --> 1:05:58.520
What the fuck?

1:06:01.224 --> 1:06:04.659
(upbeat electronic music)

1:06:31.621 --> 1:06:33.955
(man yells)

1:06:33.957 --> 1:06:37.659
(upbeat electronic music)

1:07:28.545 --> 1:07:30.912
(man growls)

1:08:23.366 --> 1:08:24.966
(man yells)

1:08:24.968 --> 1:08:26.468
- [Zack] Get up bitch.

1:08:26.470 --> 1:08:27.335
- Fuck you, man!

1:08:28.872 --> 1:08:30.105
(man yells)

1:08:30.107 --> 1:08:32.474
- [Zack] Get up yo, come on.

1:08:32.476 --> 1:08:33.708
- You five, fuck!

1:08:33.710 --> 1:08:34.943
You shot me in my arm, man!

1:08:34.945 --> 1:08:36.544
- I did bitch, and I'm
gonna shoot you again

1:08:36.546 --> 1:08:37.712
if you don't give
me the fucking name.

1:08:37.714 --> 1:08:38.713
- What name, man?

1:08:38.715 --> 1:08:40.381
- [Zack] The fucking sauce, B!

1:08:40.383 --> 1:08:41.816
Give me the fucking name!

1:08:43.787 --> 1:08:47.088
- Lays, Trace, Gaze, I
don't fucking know man!

1:08:47.090 --> 1:08:48.790
What the fuck, man?

1:08:50.594 --> 1:08:51.459
Bitch!

1:08:55.665 --> 1:08:57.065
- Yo, Martelli.

1:08:57.067 --> 1:08:59.467
Check for an African north
side dealer named Bijou.

1:09:00.770 --> 1:09:01.970
He plugged our killer.

1:09:02.772 --> 1:09:04.038
The killer's name is Chase.

1:09:17.354 --> 1:09:18.586
- You good man?

1:09:18.588 --> 1:09:20.088
You were really
quiet the whole ride.

1:09:20.090 --> 1:09:23.024
- Just a lot on my head
right now, man, you know?

1:09:23.026 --> 1:09:27.095
Stuff at the office,
projects, just working, man.

1:09:27.097 --> 1:09:29.097
It's a lot right now.

1:09:30.867 --> 1:09:32.066
- Glad you mentioned that.

1:09:33.603 --> 1:09:35.570
You ever seen this drug before?

1:09:37.607 --> 1:09:38.907
Maybe you can look it up for me.

1:09:45.215 --> 1:09:46.214
- No.

1:09:46.216 --> 1:09:47.415
I haven't heard of it.

1:09:48.852 --> 1:09:50.185
I'll have to check it out, man.

1:09:54.791 --> 1:09:55.957
I just realized actually,

1:09:55.959 --> 1:09:57.025
I gotta go run a
couple more errands man

1:09:57.027 --> 1:09:59.360
before I head back home.

1:10:53.383 --> 1:10:54.349
- Hey Chase.

1:10:54.351 --> 1:10:55.583
What you got in that bag, bro?

1:10:55.585 --> 1:10:57.685
I wanna talk to you, man.

1:11:07.030 --> 1:11:08.129
Hey!

1:11:21.878 --> 1:11:23.111
Son of a bitch!

1:11:30.420 --> 1:11:34.122
(upbeat electronic music)

1:11:52.275 --> 1:11:55.743
- Rush wanted me to check
the fueling on the foggers!

1:11:55.745 --> 1:11:59.681
- There's one here and there's
another on the other side!

1:12:00.784 --> 1:12:04.419
(upbeat electronic music)

1:12:26.276 --> 1:12:27.842
- I like this rock candy.

1:12:30.780 --> 1:12:31.879
This is much more important.

1:12:31.881 --> 1:12:32.747
Watch.

1:12:34.317 --> 1:12:35.216
Damn!

1:12:35.218 --> 1:12:36.317
(woman giggles)

1:12:36.319 --> 1:12:37.885
Hey baby, try this.

1:12:38.988 --> 1:12:40.888
Yo, who kicked your ass?

1:12:40.890 --> 1:12:43.491
(men laugh)

1:12:43.493 --> 1:12:46.060
- So nice of you to care to ask.

1:12:46.062 --> 1:12:48.796
Your boy, Chase.

1:12:51.134 --> 1:12:52.033
- What about him?

1:12:56.873 --> 1:12:59.941
- It was him, all of it.

1:13:01.678 --> 1:13:02.643
He killed them all.

1:13:07.384 --> 1:13:08.483
- Everybody out.

1:13:09.819 --> 1:13:10.651
Now!

1:13:12.522 --> 1:13:14.288
Tommy, get the fuck out of here!

1:13:16.393 --> 1:13:18.059
- Didn't I tell you?

1:13:18.061 --> 1:13:18.826
Didn't I tell you?

1:13:18.828 --> 1:13:19.660
- It can't be.

1:13:21.331 --> 1:13:22.430
This is Zack.

1:13:24.334 --> 1:13:26.234
- Tommy, get the fuck out!

1:13:27.904 --> 1:13:28.970
- Bye bye.
- Chase.

1:13:35.211 --> 1:13:38.646
(upbeat electronic music)

1:13:41.451 --> 1:13:43.017
I put everything on this, man!

1:13:43.019 --> 1:13:44.452
I swear to you Rush!

1:13:45.622 --> 1:13:47.688
I find out you had anything
to do with it, anything,

1:13:52.395 --> 1:13:54.929
you'll be lucky to end
up in jail, you hear me?

1:13:59.769 --> 1:14:00.568
- Dude, come on.

1:14:00.570 --> 1:14:01.602
You're up.

1:14:01.604 --> 1:14:02.770
- Run my drive.

1:14:02.772 --> 1:14:03.738
- Come on, come on.

1:14:03.740 --> 1:14:04.872
We don't have time for that.

1:14:04.874 --> 1:14:06.607
- Where the fuck is Tommy?

1:14:11.781 --> 1:14:13.915
- [Woman] We look
so good tonight!

1:14:13.917 --> 1:14:15.283
- DJ Rush!

1:14:15.285 --> 1:14:16.150
- Yes girl.

1:14:16.920 --> 1:14:18.085
- He gave you an eye.

1:14:18.087 --> 1:14:19.587
Did you see it?

1:14:19.589 --> 1:14:24.659
(women laugh)
(suspenseful music)

1:14:25.094 --> 1:14:26.561
- Ladies.

1:14:26.563 --> 1:14:27.662
What's up?

1:14:29.566 --> 1:14:31.499
- No, we're fine!

1:14:31.501 --> 1:14:32.633
See ya!

1:14:40.410 --> 1:14:41.909
Get out of here.

1:14:41.911 --> 1:14:42.777
- Dude!

1:14:42.779 --> 1:14:44.078
- You wanna go party?

1:14:44.080 --> 1:14:45.513
- Leave us alone.
- Kick it loser!

1:14:48.485 --> 1:14:49.717
- Fucking bitch!

1:14:50.620 --> 1:14:54.055
(upbeat electronic music)

1:15:38.034 --> 1:15:39.700
- [Woman] Get ready!

1:15:39.702 --> 1:15:43.704
(crowd chanting)
Are you ready?

1:15:51.981 --> 1:15:54.715
(crowd cheering)

1:15:58.821 --> 1:16:02.256
(upbeat electronic music)

1:16:33.289 --> 1:16:37.158
- [Narrator] I can feel
it running through me.

1:16:38.561 --> 1:16:40.528
It's become a prophecy.

1:16:42.398 --> 1:16:44.932
My time to reveal the illusion.

1:16:46.269 --> 1:16:48.469
I can't stand how I live.

1:16:49.606 --> 1:16:52.573
And I'm gonna make
them pay at all cost.

1:16:52.575 --> 1:16:56.010
(upbeat electronic music)

1:17:23.973 --> 1:17:25.873
- Yo man, what's up?

1:17:32.982 --> 1:17:33.981
- Dude, you hear me calling you?

1:17:33.983 --> 1:17:35.016
- [Chase] Shut the fuck up!

1:17:35.018 --> 1:17:35.816
You don't know who I am!

1:17:35.818 --> 1:17:36.617
Back up!

1:17:36.619 --> 1:17:37.485
- I will not!

1:17:38.755 --> 1:17:39.854
- Shut up!

1:17:39.856 --> 1:17:42.023
You just get back up
out of space, okay?

1:17:43.126 --> 1:17:43.858
- Rush doesn't need
people like you.

1:17:43.860 --> 1:17:45.693
- Get off of me!

1:17:45.695 --> 1:17:47.094
- Fucking around, all right?

1:17:47.096 --> 1:17:48.262
- I'm not stalking anybody!

1:17:48.264 --> 1:17:49.497
Back off of me, okay?

1:17:49.499 --> 1:17:50.798
- Don't fucking
touch me, all right?

1:17:50.800 --> 1:17:51.999
- Don't you ever put
your hands on me.

1:17:52.001 --> 1:17:52.633
- I know you got
something to do with her!

1:17:52.635 --> 1:17:53.601
- Touch me again!

1:17:53.603 --> 1:17:54.835
- And then what?

1:17:54.837 --> 1:17:55.803
- You know what, back
the hell up, okay?

1:17:55.805 --> 1:17:57.038
- Fuck you!
- Back up!

1:17:57.040 --> 1:17:57.972
- I'm not gonna fucking back up!

1:17:57.974 --> 1:17:58.939
- Touch me one more time!

1:17:58.941 --> 1:17:59.974
- And what?

1:17:59.976 --> 1:18:01.609
What's gonna happen?

1:18:04.280 --> 1:18:07.581
- This is what you've
been waiting for.

1:18:08.818 --> 1:18:10.618
Most humans are driven by fear.

1:18:11.487 --> 1:18:13.521
I could see it in your eyes.

1:18:13.523 --> 1:18:14.388
It's all I see.

1:18:18.127 --> 1:18:23.097
I redeemed them and sent
them back to their grave.

1:18:26.969 --> 1:18:28.869
- Let me go, let me go.

1:18:28.871 --> 1:18:31.038
- Your generation
loves to get high, huh?

1:18:31.040 --> 1:18:32.006
You wanna get high?

1:18:32.008 --> 1:18:33.140
Take this down!

1:18:33.142 --> 1:18:34.642
Take it all baby!

1:18:34.644 --> 1:18:35.443
You love it.

1:18:36.813 --> 1:18:38.212
- Just let me go!

1:18:38.214 --> 1:18:39.914
- I can't do that!

1:18:41.017 --> 1:18:43.317
You made it seem
like I was just here

1:18:43.319 --> 1:18:45.052
for some fucking cheap thrill!

1:18:46.222 --> 1:18:50.057
You have no clue of what the
message that I'm here to bring!

1:18:50.059 --> 1:18:51.425
- I don't care.

1:18:51.427 --> 1:18:54.228
- You'll never see the light
of my father's kingdom!

1:18:55.598 --> 1:18:56.831
- I don't care.

1:18:56.833 --> 1:18:58.933
Why'd you do this to Rush?

1:18:58.935 --> 1:19:01.402
- Because he's housing
these fucking idiots.

1:19:02.839 --> 1:19:07.441
They'll never be redeemable
unless I shepherd them!

1:19:08.044 --> 1:19:09.243
- They're just kids.

1:19:13.182 --> 1:19:14.582
I won't say anything.

1:19:16.619 --> 1:19:17.685
- It's too late for that.

1:19:19.188 --> 1:19:21.222
- Just let me go, please.

1:19:21.224 --> 1:19:22.089
Please!

1:19:24.060 --> 1:19:25.226
- The fuck are you doing here?

1:19:25.228 --> 1:19:26.193
- Chill out.

1:19:26.195 --> 1:19:27.128
It's cool.

1:19:27.130 --> 1:19:27.828
- It's cool.
- Back up!

1:19:31.734 --> 1:19:34.034
- You move and she's
dead, understand?

1:19:34.036 --> 1:19:36.137
- You do that, you won't
live to see her body drop.

1:19:36.139 --> 1:19:37.271
Back away!

1:19:39.275 --> 1:19:40.875
- I'm not playing!

1:19:40.877 --> 1:19:42.209
Back up!

1:19:42.211 --> 1:19:43.944
- Neither am I.

1:19:43.946 --> 1:19:45.379
What you did to
those little girls,

1:19:45.381 --> 1:19:47.081
think I'm gonna let
you walk out of here?

1:19:47.083 --> 1:19:49.717
You're crazier than
you pretend to be.

1:19:49.719 --> 1:19:51.919
- You don't know
who the fuck I am!

1:19:51.921 --> 1:19:53.354
You know nothing about me.

1:19:55.291 --> 1:19:56.690
- I know who you are, Chase.

1:19:59.662 --> 1:20:01.662
Chase Ellinburg.

1:20:01.664 --> 1:20:03.097
That's you, right?

1:20:03.099 --> 1:20:05.065
Parents died in a
tragic accident.

1:20:05.067 --> 1:20:06.267
- Don't talk about my parents.

1:20:06.269 --> 1:20:07.802
Don't talk about my parents!

1:20:07.804 --> 1:20:09.170
Never talk about my parents!

1:20:09.172 --> 1:20:10.604
- You're not gonna like
the fact that I know

1:20:10.606 --> 1:20:12.306
that that same accident left you

1:20:12.308 --> 1:20:14.141
mangled from the waist down.

1:20:14.143 --> 1:20:15.009
- Shut up!

1:20:16.145 --> 1:20:17.478
Shut up!

1:20:17.480 --> 1:20:20.548
(man laughs evilly)

1:20:22.018 --> 1:20:23.417
- [Zack] That's why you
killed those little girls.

1:20:23.419 --> 1:20:25.052
You can't be a man, can you?

1:20:26.789 --> 1:20:29.323
(man growls)

1:20:29.325 --> 1:20:34.395
- I am the great healer!
(woman screams)

1:20:35.531 --> 1:20:37.097
- Drop her or I'll fucking
blow your head off!

1:20:37.099 --> 1:20:40.534
(upbeat electronic music)

1:21:03.693 --> 1:21:06.160
- Chase, what the fuck?

1:21:06.162 --> 1:21:06.961
Chase!

1:21:08.164 --> 1:21:09.163
What are you doing?

1:21:09.165 --> 1:21:10.731
Chase, calm down.

1:21:10.733 --> 1:21:12.733
- Everybody back the fuck up!
(crowd yells)

1:21:12.735 --> 1:21:14.969
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1:21:14.971 --> 1:21:18.305
Zack, Zack, Zack.

1:21:18.307 --> 1:21:19.506
Back up.

1:21:19.508 --> 1:21:21.275
Chase, what happened?

1:21:22.478 --> 1:21:24.478
You can always come to me, man.

1:21:24.480 --> 1:21:26.313
We came up like
brothers, me and you.

1:21:27.516 --> 1:21:30.084
- Some fucked up Cain and
Abel type shit, right?

1:21:30.086 --> 1:21:31.552
- No, no, no.

1:21:31.554 --> 1:21:32.653
It's just got a little crazy.

1:21:32.655 --> 1:21:34.488
We can fix this.

1:21:34.490 --> 1:21:35.489
- Shut up!

1:21:35.491 --> 1:21:36.657
Don't say that!

1:21:36.659 --> 1:21:38.325
We can't fix anything!

1:21:38.327 --> 1:21:40.294
Nobody can fix us anymore!

1:21:41.931 --> 1:21:45.199
You got no clue with the
torture I've been through!

1:21:45.201 --> 1:21:50.170
- Not personally, but I was
with you, in the hospital.

1:21:50.172 --> 1:21:53.107
Every step, I was with you.

1:21:53.109 --> 1:21:56.844
Chase, look what you did for me.

1:21:56.846 --> 1:21:58.445
Look, you did this.

1:21:59.615 --> 1:22:02.016
- I was just trying
to save them, brother!

1:22:02.018 --> 1:22:04.018
I was trying to do something and

1:22:04.020 --> 1:22:05.586
make a difference in my life!

1:22:05.588 --> 1:22:07.454
- This isn't you Chase.

1:22:07.456 --> 1:22:09.356
- It's so much more
worse than this, man!

1:22:09.358 --> 1:22:11.692
You don't even know!

1:22:11.694 --> 1:22:13.294
- Not the kids.

1:22:13.296 --> 1:22:14.695
- They're all a
bunch of fucked up

1:22:14.697 --> 1:22:18.399
junkies getting high every
day, living to get high!

1:22:18.401 --> 1:22:21.302
They don't care who they affect!

1:22:22.104 --> 1:22:24.238
I lost everything!

1:22:24.240 --> 1:22:25.539
You don't understand Rush!

1:22:25.541 --> 1:22:27.141
You got a family!

1:22:27.143 --> 1:22:28.342
I got nothing!

1:22:30.980 --> 1:22:34.581
The spirit sent me to send
a message to the world,

1:22:34.583 --> 1:22:35.616
to wake up!

1:22:35.618 --> 1:22:37.584
- Fuck that!

1:22:37.586 --> 1:22:40.521
You killed those
kids to save them?

1:22:41.624 --> 1:22:42.890
What did those kids
ever do to you?

1:22:42.892 --> 1:22:44.625
- I redeemed them!

1:22:44.627 --> 1:22:47.494
I sent them back to
the great creator,

1:22:47.496 --> 1:22:50.264
to renew them, to send
them back as fresh souls!

1:22:50.266 --> 1:22:52.399
- No, this is not how it works.

1:22:52.401 --> 1:22:53.300
You owe me!

1:22:54.070 --> 1:22:56.070
- It's not about who they were!

1:22:57.340 --> 1:22:59.573
It's about what they represent!

1:22:59.575 --> 1:23:00.507
- [Rush] Chase,
they're just kids.

1:23:00.509 --> 1:23:01.842
They don't deserve any of this.

1:23:01.844 --> 1:23:03.110
- A bunch of wasted potential.

1:23:03.112 --> 1:23:04.345
Look at them!

1:23:04.347 --> 1:23:05.579
They ain't doing nothing
with their lives!

1:23:05.581 --> 1:23:07.614
- Bro, they did not
kill your parents,

1:23:07.616 --> 1:23:10.284
and they did not hurt
you in that crash!

1:23:10.286 --> 1:23:12.853
It was some stupid addict.

1:23:12.855 --> 1:23:15.656
- Junkie kids, drug addicts!
- So what?

1:23:15.658 --> 1:23:18.425
- Waste, useless, waste!

1:23:18.427 --> 1:23:19.860
- So what?

1:23:19.862 --> 1:23:21.762
What does any of that have to do

1:23:21.764 --> 1:23:23.597
with you taking revenge
out on everyone?

1:23:23.599 --> 1:23:25.499
Just give me the knife.

1:23:25.501 --> 1:23:27.167
- Back up, Rush!

1:23:27.169 --> 1:23:28.602
Want me to hurt you or hurt her?

1:23:28.604 --> 1:23:29.670
I will do it.

1:23:29.672 --> 1:23:32.606
Somebody has to be
the wake-up call.

1:23:32.608 --> 1:23:35.709
Somebody gotta pay the price.

1:23:35.711 --> 1:23:37.277
- Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1:23:39.548 --> 1:23:42.249
(woman yells)

1:23:58.567 --> 1:24:00.034
- All secure!

1:24:00.036 --> 1:24:01.268
Send in the medics!

1:24:07.576 --> 1:24:11.412
- Lord, forgive me for
all my shortcomings.

1:24:25.161 --> 1:24:30.230
(woman yelling)
(man gasping)

1:24:33.602 --> 1:24:35.769
- 10 milligrams of
phenylamine injected!

1:24:35.771 --> 1:24:37.404
- [Chase] Let me go!

1:24:37.406 --> 1:24:41.041
- [EMT] Inbound with multiple
gunshot wounds to the chest!

1:24:41.043 --> 1:24:42.643
He's stabilizing!

1:24:43.913 --> 1:24:46.413
(man groaning)

1:24:49.685 --> 1:24:50.784
- Circle.

1:24:52.922 --> 1:24:54.421
- No.

1:24:54.423 --> 1:24:55.289
Calm down.

1:24:56.892 --> 1:24:58.358
- Calm down, calm down.

1:24:58.360 --> 1:25:00.194
What about the circle?

1:25:04.900 --> 1:25:07.000
- [Chase] The illusion.

1:25:15.478 --> 1:25:16.276
- His IV fell out.

1:25:16.278 --> 1:25:17.678
- Do something.

1:25:19.448 --> 1:25:21.281
- Give me some morphine.

1:25:21.283 --> 1:25:22.783
16, two of them.

1:25:25.221 --> 1:25:26.820
- Shit, this is all my fault.

1:25:32.461 --> 1:25:33.660
- How you figure that?

1:25:36.832 --> 1:25:38.499
- I should've known.

1:25:40.402 --> 1:25:43.871
I should've known he
was out of control.

1:25:52.114 --> 1:25:54.982
- Out of control, maybe.

1:25:56.485 --> 1:25:57.818
A murderer, a sociopath,

1:25:57.820 --> 1:25:59.553
I doubt you could've
figured that out.

1:26:01.023 --> 1:26:02.256
- Still.

1:26:02.258 --> 1:26:06.660
- Look dude, your
family took him in, man.

1:26:07.830 --> 1:26:09.696
You took him on this
an amazing journey.

1:26:10.966 --> 1:26:11.899
You paid him well.

1:26:13.502 --> 1:26:14.835
Don't you think you did enough?

1:26:14.837 --> 1:26:17.171
All of that man, and
he still hated himself.

1:26:18.941 --> 1:26:20.374
It's not your fault, Rush.

1:26:21.877 --> 1:26:22.743
He was sick.

1:26:32.788 --> 1:26:35.923
- You know, you guys
are a lot alike.

1:26:39.895 --> 1:26:41.628
- How?

1:26:41.630 --> 1:26:46.300
- You chase by the same demons,
just different obsessions.

1:26:47.803 --> 1:26:52.739
Yours is saving citizens
and his was saving souls.

1:26:54.877 --> 1:26:56.143
- I don't quite follow.

1:26:58.981 --> 1:27:03.150
- You both blame the
scene for what y'all lost.

1:27:11.160 --> 1:27:12.793
You haven't been
able to move on.

1:27:13.862 --> 1:27:15.095
You're just stuck.

1:27:19.001 --> 1:27:20.167
- I hope not anymore.

1:27:24.340 --> 1:27:26.173
What you gonna do now?

1:27:33.182 --> 1:27:35.115
Whatever you doing man,

1:27:38.454 --> 1:27:40.721
don't stop the music, bro.

1:27:40.723 --> 1:27:41.588
- Never that.

1:27:43.025 --> 1:27:43.857
Later.

1:27:47.096 --> 1:27:47.961
Later.

1:27:49.698 --> 1:27:50.530
- Later.

a couple bullets to
stop a catalyst like me.

1:28:18.093 --> 1:28:19.693
Who am I kidding?

1:28:20.462 --> 1:28:22.162
I just like killing people.
