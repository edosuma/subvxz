00:01.101 --> 00:03.036
In an unprecedented
year of challenge and loss,

00:03.036 --> 00:07.140
the American spirit continued
to survive and even thrive.

00:07.140 --> 00:10.444
There's no reason why you can't
be a $100 million company.

00:10.444 --> 00:13.680
I only have two words.
Let's go!

00:13.680 --> 00:15.849
"Shark Tank" remained
a steadfast champion

00:15.849 --> 00:18.018
for small business,
for the startups...

00:18.018 --> 00:21.889
After we aired on "Shark Tank,"
we grew to over 500 women.

00:21.889 --> 00:23.023
...the mom and pops...

00:23.023 --> 00:25.425
I wanted to start
something that would be able

00:25.425 --> 00:26.627
to give back
to my hometown.

00:26.627 --> 00:27.661
...the dreamers...

00:27.661 --> 00:28.929
I love seeing your progress,

00:28.929 --> 00:31.632
and I can't wait to
see you in person when
this whole thing is over.

00:31.632 --> 00:33.367
...and the innovators.

00:35.302 --> 00:36.036
Come on, come on!

00:36.036 --> 00:39.506
When you have
a big dream, seize that moment

00:39.506 --> 00:41.808
because dreams
really do come true,

00:41.808 --> 00:43.911
and that's something
worth fighting for.

00:43.911 --> 00:46.613
For those of you who are
wanting to follow your dream,

00:46.613 --> 00:48.415
I encourage you
to never give up.

00:48.415 --> 00:49.483
This pandemic,

00:49.483 --> 00:50.751
everybody's had to change
in every way.

00:50.751 --> 00:52.619
Wherever there's change,
there's opportunity.

00:52.619 --> 00:53.820
We will come out of this,

00:53.820 --> 00:56.823
and there will be entrepreneurs
that take this moment

00:56.823 --> 00:57.824
and will change the world.

00:57.824 --> 01:00.093
‐

01:00.627 --> 01:02.563
I'd like to be
part of the journey.

01:02.563 --> 01:05.465
If you're gonna dream,
let's dream big, baby.

01:05.465 --> 01:07.701
And this season...

01:07.701 --> 01:10.771
American ingenuity
is alive and well.

01:10.771 --> 01:13.507
Whoa!
And we're once again celebrating

01:13.507 --> 01:15.676
the nation's best entrepreneurs.

01:15.676 --> 01:17.911
I didn't quit my job
to just start this business.

01:17.911 --> 01:20.447
I quit my job
because I had a calling.

01:20.914 --> 01:23.650
It's gonna revolutionize
the entire world.

01:23.650 --> 01:25.018
This is a once‐in‐a‐lifetime
opportunity,

01:25.018 --> 01:27.654
to make an impact on the health
of billions of people.

01:27.654 --> 01:29.556
I did a million dollars
in sales.

01:29.556 --> 01:31.491
‐You're 19 years old?
‐Oh, my God!

01:31.491 --> 01:32.793
Yeah!

01:32.793 --> 01:34.628
So, I'd like
to make you an offer.

01:34.628 --> 01:35.996
And tonight, Emma Grede,

01:35.996 --> 01:39.766
founder and C. E. O. of smash hit
apparel brand Good American

01:39.766 --> 01:42.803
and founding partner of SKIMS,
joins the Tank.

01:42.803 --> 01:44.638
You could be
anything you want to be.

01:44.638 --> 01:46.540
You can set this world on fire.

01:46.540 --> 01:49.643
The new season starts now.

01:49.643 --> 01:51.912
I don't have time
to take the traditional path.

01:51.912 --> 01:54.715
This is a true vision.
We want to change the world.

01:54.715 --> 01:56.583
‐Whoa!
‐Oh!

01:56.583 --> 01:57.884
And we rebuild...

01:57.884 --> 02:00.854
Going bankrupt, I've seen the
lowest lows of entrepreneurship.

02:00.854 --> 02:02.623
...recover...
We're on a rocket ship

02:02.623 --> 02:03.890
going straight
for the moon, baby.

02:03.890 --> 02:05.792
...and fight for the future.

02:05.792 --> 02:08.395
I can't leave this carpet
without a deal.

02:08.395 --> 02:09.696
It's my purpose on Earth.

02:09.696 --> 02:10.897
I know how to
make this thing huge.

02:10.897 --> 02:12.532
I'm afraid
you might hold me back.

02:12.532 --> 02:13.967
‐It's worthless!
‐Kevin!

02:13.967 --> 02:16.003
You are alone for a reason.
He's an animal.

02:16.003 --> 02:18.705
I'm the only Shark
that tells the truth!

02:18.705 --> 02:21.642
"Shark Tank" is back,
better than ever.

02:21.642 --> 02:22.743
‐Wow.
‐I'm powerful.

02:22.743 --> 02:24.578
‐
‐I'm strong.

02:24.578 --> 02:26.680
‐
‐I'm courageous.

02:26.680 --> 02:29.149
Sharks, let's go.

02:29.549 --> 02:30.817
I love all this "Kumbaya" stuff,

02:30.817 --> 02:32.853
but I can't figure out if I can
make any money.

02:38.558 --> 02:40.694
‐Welcome, Emma.
‐Oh, thank you!

02:40.694 --> 02:42.629
‐Whoo!
‐Whoo!

02:42.629 --> 02:44.431
That's the last time
we're gonna be nice to you.

02:44.431 --> 02:45.565
I know.
I can feel it.

02:45.565 --> 02:47.567
It's about to turn.

02:49.836 --> 02:50.937
First in the Tank

02:50.937 --> 02:55.275
is an apparel company
with inclusivity in mind.

03:01.515 --> 03:03.850
Hello, Sharks.
My name is Philomina Kane,

03:03.850 --> 03:07.120
and I am from
the boogie‐down Bronx, New York,

03:07.120 --> 03:12.592
and I am here seeking $200,000
in exchange for 10% equity

03:12.592 --> 03:14.961
in my company, KINApparel.

03:14.961 --> 03:19.433
Sharks, by a raise of hands,
how many of you own a hoodie?

03:22.436 --> 03:23.003
‐Lots.
‐Okay.

03:23.003 --> 03:26.440
Now, how many of you
own a hair‐care product?

03:29.109 --> 03:33.580
Alright. I am here to tell you
that you can have both in one

03:33.580 --> 03:36.316
with KINApparel.

03:36.316 --> 03:37.084
Ah.
Oh, yeah.

03:37.084 --> 03:40.787
At KINApparel, we are
revolutionizing hair care,

03:40.787 --> 03:42.756
with fashion and inclusion,

03:42.756 --> 03:46.760
with our satin‐lined...

03:46.760 --> 03:48.762
hoodies.

03:48.762 --> 03:52.766
You see, Sharks, traditional
hoodies are made with cotton,

03:52.766 --> 03:55.836
a material that absorbs
the moisture in your hair,

03:55.836 --> 03:59.773
leaving it dry, frizzy,
and prone to breakage.

03:59.773 --> 04:02.943
Consider the girl
with big, beautiful curls

04:02.943 --> 04:06.346
who can't find a hood
big enough to fit her hair,

04:06.346 --> 04:07.647
or the guy with locks

04:07.647 --> 04:10.517
trying to stop lint balls
from forming on his hair.

04:10.517 --> 04:11.952
At KINApparel,

04:11.952 --> 04:16.723
we line our hoods
with the finest quality satin,

04:16.723 --> 04:18.859
a soft and smooth material

04:18.859 --> 04:22.963
that, by nature, helps retain
moisture and reduce friction.

04:22.963 --> 04:27.400
That, coupled with our large
hoods to fit all hair sizes,

04:27.400 --> 04:30.537
means more protection...

04:30.537 --> 04:33.740
no frizz,
and all‐around comfort.

04:33.740 --> 04:37.611
So, Sharks, who's ready
to Keep It Naturally

04:37.611 --> 04:39.846
with KINApparel?

04:39.846 --> 04:41.681
Good job.
Thank you.

04:41.681 --> 04:43.583
Great enthusiasm.
Sharks, you have

04:43.583 --> 04:45.585
our most popular hoodies
right there.

04:45.585 --> 04:46.820
Those are our thick hoodies.

04:46.820 --> 04:47.921
Ooh.
And you also have

04:47.921 --> 04:52.592
our innovative
reversible satin pillowcases.

04:52.592 --> 04:53.760
So, Philomina, what made you

04:53.760 --> 04:55.929
think of putting satin
into a hoodie?

04:55.929 --> 04:59.766
In 2013, I got a full ride
to Princeton University.

04:59.766 --> 05:01.802
Wow.
And that's where
I did my undergrad.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.870
Good for you.
And I was very stressed.

05:03.870 --> 05:05.705
Like,
it was really hard on me.

05:05.705 --> 05:07.774
My hair was falling out.

05:07.774 --> 05:09.676
Oh.
Yeah. My hair was falling out

05:09.676 --> 05:11.044
because I was stressed.

05:11.044 --> 05:14.714
And also, I come from
a family of hair stylists.

05:14.714 --> 05:16.616
So when I was home in the Bronx,

05:16.616 --> 05:18.585
they would always
take care of my hair.

05:18.585 --> 05:19.853
So, when I went over
to Princeton,

05:19.853 --> 05:21.955
it cost like $100
to get my hair done.

05:21.955 --> 05:23.757
I didn't have that money!

05:23.757 --> 05:26.560
So I was like, "You know what?
Let me chop it off."

05:26.560 --> 05:27.627
So ‐‐
I did the same thing.

05:27.627 --> 05:28.695
Oh, you did?

05:30.030 --> 05:32.566
Here I was, with, like,
my hair growing back.

05:32.566 --> 05:33.934
I needed to protect it.

05:33.934 --> 05:36.636
And I found myself always
putting, like, a scarf on

05:36.636 --> 05:38.004
before putting the hoodie on.

05:38.004 --> 05:39.739
One day, I was like,
"You know what?

05:39.739 --> 05:41.808
I'm gonna make
satin‐lined hoodies."

05:41.808 --> 05:43.877
When you were at Princeton,
what were you studying?

05:43.877 --> 05:47.714
Yeah, it's crazy, 'cause my
degree is in ecological biology.

05:47.714 --> 05:48.748
‐Oh, really?
‐Oh, wow.

05:48.748 --> 05:50.617
Naturally.

05:50.617 --> 05:52.853
With a certificate
in global health.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.688
So, I actually did get into

05:54.688 --> 05:57.657
the Columbia Mailman
School of Public Health.

05:57.657 --> 05:59.993
Good for you.
But I ended up not going.

05:59.993 --> 06:02.562
Can you tell me, like, where
are you manufacturing these,

06:02.562 --> 06:04.497
and how much
do they sell for?

06:04.497 --> 06:06.132
So, we are manufacturing
in China.

06:06.132 --> 06:09.402
The ones that you have right now
are our thick hoodies.

06:09.402 --> 06:11.771
Those cost $13.75 to make

06:11.771 --> 06:14.474
and $16.75 landed,

06:14.474 --> 06:16.476
and we sell it for $80.

06:16.476 --> 06:18.578
Wow.
That's a great margin.

06:18.578 --> 06:19.679
I'm a YouTuber.

06:19.679 --> 06:22.482
I have almost 200,000
subscribers on YouTube.

06:22.482 --> 06:23.016
‐Good for you.
‐Wow.

06:23.016 --> 06:25.085
Thank you.
And on YouTube, I do hair.

06:25.085 --> 06:29.489
I basically help Black women
embrace their natural hair,

06:29.489 --> 06:30.657
and it was mainly because

06:30.657 --> 06:33.627
I wanted to document
my own journey.

06:35.595 --> 06:36.763
Okay.

06:38.798 --> 06:40.133
But it became bigger than that,

06:40.133 --> 06:42.903
because people were coming and
saying, "You're inspiring me.

06:42.903 --> 06:45.672
You're motivating me
to take care of my hair."

06:45.672 --> 06:48.141
I'm sorry.

06:50.744 --> 06:53.580
Tell us,
why are you sad?

06:53.580 --> 06:55.715
Okay.

06:55.715 --> 06:58.451
I'm sorry.
I'm crying because

06:58.451 --> 07:00.687
it wasn't the original plan,

07:00.687 --> 07:05.659
and I got a lot of flak from it,
from my family.

07:05.659 --> 07:07.827
So, you know,
I have immigrant parents.

07:07.827 --> 07:10.630
We're from Ghana, West Africa,

07:10.630 --> 07:13.166
and I was raised
by my grandmother in Ghana.

07:13.166 --> 07:17.871
And at a young age, I've always
loved helping people.

07:17.871 --> 07:20.941
I wanted to do that
with global health.

07:20.941 --> 07:23.076
But when I chopped off
all of my hair

07:23.076 --> 07:27.013
and began my hair care journey,
I was just so passionate

07:27.013 --> 07:29.983
about making hair care
more inclusive for others.

07:29.983 --> 07:33.019
But the thing is, like, my mom
looks at my accomplishes now,

07:33.019 --> 07:36.589
and she's like, "Wow. I'm
so glad that you actually ‐‐"

07:36.589 --> 07:37.791
So you've made peace
with them.

07:37.791 --> 07:38.992
Yeah. She's happy.

07:38.992 --> 07:40.860
She's so happy.
Which I'm guessing

07:40.860 --> 07:42.829
means you have good sales.

07:42.829 --> 07:44.664
Mr. Wonderful,
I know you like sales.

07:44.664 --> 07:45.865
I do. I was wondering

07:45.865 --> 07:47.634
if you were gonna
tell us about them.
Tell us. Tell us.

07:47.634 --> 07:48.868
Alright. So, like I said,

07:48.868 --> 07:52.772
I started this company
last year with $500,

07:52.772 --> 07:55.642
$500 that I only
put into marketing,

07:55.642 --> 07:58.645
and we made $246,000.

07:58.645 --> 07:59.746
‐Wow.
‐Wow. Okay.

07:59.746 --> 08:00.814
Good for you.
And this year,

08:00.814 --> 08:03.650
we are at $355,000.

08:03.650 --> 08:04.884
‐Wow.
‐Really?

08:04.884 --> 08:07.554
What's your customer
acquisition cost?

08:07.554 --> 08:08.688
It's zero.

08:08.688 --> 08:09.889
‐Zero?
‐

08:09.889 --> 08:14.160
So, you're doing over $350,000
of sales this year so far

08:14.160 --> 08:16.029
with zero acquisition cost?
Yeah, because I'm ‐‐

08:16.029 --> 08:17.464
You're not spending
any money on digital?

08:17.464 --> 08:19.799
Well, she's got 200,000
followers. That's the community.
I don't spend money because ‐‐

08:19.799 --> 08:21.034
It's not even
the YouTube channel.

08:21.034 --> 08:24.738
We're always constantly going
viral on Instagram and TikTok.

08:24.738 --> 08:26.606
Like, are you selling out
of these hoodies?

08:26.606 --> 08:27.874
Yes, and that's
my biggest problem,

08:27.874 --> 08:29.642
and that's also why I'm here.

08:29.642 --> 08:30.810
Like, I want to make the deal

08:30.810 --> 08:34.647
so that I can buy more and stop
being on pre‐order. So ‐‐

08:34.647 --> 08:35.782
Oh, you're on pre‐order
at the moment?

08:35.782 --> 08:36.816
Yeah.
The thing with pre‐order

08:36.816 --> 08:38.752
is that it takes
four to six weeks.

08:38.752 --> 08:40.253
So, you're making customers
wait four to six weeks?

08:40.253 --> 08:43.189
Yes. When we sell out, I have to
put the products on pre‐order,

08:43.189 --> 08:46.459
or else when you come to the
site, you can't buy anything,

08:46.459 --> 08:48.094
so then I'm not making money.

08:48.094 --> 08:50.563
How much money do you have
in the bank right now?

08:50.563 --> 08:52.032
I have $150,000.

08:52.032 --> 08:54.768
And how much do you have
in inventory?

08:54.768 --> 08:57.404
Ooh.

08:57.404 --> 09:00.473
In inventory?

09:00.473 --> 09:02.575
In inventory,

09:02.575 --> 09:06.346
I got like $500 or less.

09:07.080 --> 09:09.783
Look, I'm very impressed
with what you've done.

09:09.783 --> 09:10.917
There's no question about it.

09:10.917 --> 09:13.553
But when I invest
in an entrepreneur,

09:13.553 --> 09:14.921
I want to use my following ‐‐

09:14.921 --> 09:18.024
5, 6 million followers
on different platforms ‐‐

09:18.024 --> 09:20.226
to help reduce
their customer acquisition cost.

09:20.226 --> 09:23.897
The only product category that
I've ever had a problem with ‐‐

09:23.897 --> 09:26.132
I've been successful
in everything

09:26.132 --> 09:30.136
except hair care products,
and I can't understand why.

09:30.136 --> 09:32.572
It just doesn't
make sense to me.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.574
So, I'm out.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.676
Thank you, Mr. Wonderful.

09:36.676 --> 09:39.546
You know, you are
a poetry in motion,

09:39.546 --> 09:42.715
a chaotic poetry
in motion.

09:42.715 --> 09:43.883
Ooh. Is that bad?

09:43.883 --> 09:46.352
Uh, not so good
when it comes to business.

09:57.630 --> 09:59.065
One Shark is out.

09:59.065 --> 10:02.068
Philomina has four chances left
to make a deal

10:02.068 --> 10:06.840
for her hair‐care‐focused
apparel company, KIN.

10:06.840 --> 10:09.843
You are
a poetry in motion,

10:09.843 --> 10:13.847
a chaotic poetry
in motion,

10:13.847 --> 10:16.049
in your presentation
of your facts

10:16.049 --> 10:19.052
as well as I even think
in your thinking,

10:19.052 --> 10:21.988
which doesn't mean to say
you aren't brilliant.

10:21.988 --> 10:23.756
I think you're brilliant.
No doubt.

10:23.756 --> 10:27.994
You are what I see often
in business ‐‐ a super creative.

10:27.994 --> 10:29.696
The downside
to super creatives

10:29.696 --> 10:31.464
is they have
an idea a minute,

10:31.464 --> 10:32.799
and then they act on it,

10:32.799 --> 10:35.068
and I don't think you need
a Shark partner,

10:35.068 --> 10:36.936
because you'd be too much
to handle.

10:36.936 --> 10:39.339
I'd spend all day long
controlling you, okay?

10:39.973 --> 10:41.908
You need a working
partner, truly,

10:41.908 --> 10:43.676
and you need someone
who's exactly opposite,

10:43.676 --> 10:44.811
someone who knows numbers,

10:44.811 --> 10:46.980
someone who loves to live
off to‐do lists, okay?

10:46.980 --> 10:49.682
I have to say,
I'm going to go out, sadly,

10:49.682 --> 10:52.385
but I think you have
enormous potential.

10:52.385 --> 10:52.986
Okay. Thank you.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.954
Yeah. Philomina,
I agree with Barbara.

10:54.954 --> 10:56.856
I always partnered
with people who are anal,

10:56.856 --> 10:58.791
and I gave up big chunks
of my business

10:58.791 --> 11:00.727
because I'm a ready,
fire, aim person,

11:00.727 --> 11:02.729
and you seem to be a ready,
fire, aim person as well.

11:02.729 --> 11:03.796
Mm. Yes. True.

11:03.796 --> 11:04.898
And you need somebody
who is, like,

11:04.898 --> 11:06.166
"No, you got to stay
within the baseline."

11:06.166 --> 11:07.967
No, Mark, that can change.
I'm here for, "It's a change."

11:07.967 --> 11:09.903
No, you can't, and it's not ‐‐
I'm not asking you to change.

11:09.903 --> 11:10.904
I don't want you
to change.

11:10.904 --> 11:12.672
You're amazing
the way you are.

11:12.672 --> 11:14.674
But recognize one
of the greatest skills

11:14.674 --> 11:16.976
an entrepreneur can have
is knowing what they can't do,

11:16.976 --> 11:19.712
and you need somebody
there full time that lives it

11:19.712 --> 11:21.915
as much as you do,
and that can't be me.

11:21.915 --> 11:23.516
So, for those reasons,
I'm out.

11:23.516 --> 11:24.517
Okay, thank you.

11:24.517 --> 11:26.953
You're welcome.

11:26.953 --> 11:28.154
You still have
two Sharks left.

11:28.154 --> 11:30.857
You do have
two sharks left.
Yes, you do.

11:30.857 --> 11:33.092
But I think the valuation
is an issue,

11:33.092 --> 11:35.061
and I think you've got
a lot of kinks to try

11:35.061 --> 11:36.663
and figure out
with this business.

11:36.663 --> 11:37.764
So, I'm here to make a deal,
so...

11:37.764 --> 11:39.632
Listen, I'm here to make
a deal, too.

11:39.632 --> 11:40.934
I think what's
really interesting

11:40.934 --> 11:42.735
and just understanding
the landscape of it

11:42.735 --> 11:43.836
more at the moment...
Yeah.

11:43.836 --> 11:46.072
...in retail, it's
that all retailers

11:46.072 --> 11:49.075
are looking for Black
female founders,

11:49.075 --> 11:51.945
and so I actually think
that this product

11:51.945 --> 11:53.146
speaking to the audience
that it does,

11:53.146 --> 11:56.716
looking as diverse and
inclusive as it really is,

11:56.716 --> 11:59.652
has a huge window
of opportunity.

11:59.652 --> 12:01.054
I think that Lori and I

12:01.054 --> 12:03.856
would be amazing Sharks
for you,

12:03.856 --> 12:05.959
with all of Lori's background
in manufacturing,

12:05.959 --> 12:08.962
with what I do with both
Good American and SKIMS,

12:08.962 --> 12:11.965
like, really understanding
the apparel landscape.

12:11.965 --> 12:13.766
So, I'd like
to make you an offer.

12:13.766 --> 12:14.834
Okay.

12:14.834 --> 12:16.636
And it is us together.

12:16.636 --> 12:19.505
30% of your business
for the $200,000

12:19.505 --> 12:21.341
that you're asking for.

12:25.645 --> 12:28.448
Would y'all do 20%?

12:29.749 --> 12:30.917
No.
No.

12:30.917 --> 12:33.186
You know, it's a fair offer,
and let me tell you why ‐‐

12:33.186 --> 12:35.688
you don't know what
you don't know right now.

12:35.688 --> 12:37.824
Right? You're just
at the beginning.

12:37.824 --> 12:39.726
You're actually gonna need
a lot of help.

12:39.726 --> 12:41.094
You're spending no money
in marketing,

12:41.094 --> 12:43.029
and all of those things
are gonna come.

12:43.029 --> 12:45.431
We can accelerate
this business...

12:47.734 --> 12:49.602
And that's your last?

12:49.602 --> 12:52.171
Y'all can't even do 25%?

12:52.872 --> 12:55.074
Here's the thing ‐‐
you're giving away something,

12:55.074 --> 12:57.076
absolutely, but think about
what you get in return.

12:57.076 --> 12:59.612
You know, I always say
I make millionaires.

12:59.612 --> 13:00.780
That's what I do.

13:00.780 --> 13:03.316
And with a partner
like Emma, hey, come on.

13:07.820 --> 13:09.789
Why are you emotional?
Tell me.

13:15.094 --> 13:18.331
I'm crying
because I'm so happy.

13:19.932 --> 13:22.769
These are happy tears because
I'm just like, "Wow.

13:22.769 --> 13:25.672
Y'all want to make
a deal with me."

13:29.642 --> 13:32.578
Lori and Emma...

13:32.578 --> 13:34.447
welcome to the KIN folk.

13:34.447 --> 13:35.648
Whoo‐hoo!
Yay!

13:37.617 --> 13:40.787
Tears of joy.

13:40.787 --> 13:41.954
Aww.

13:41.954 --> 13:43.723
Congratulations, Philomina.
Well done.

13:43.723 --> 13:45.124
Whoo‐hoo!

13:45.124 --> 13:48.428
First deal in the Tank!

13:48.428 --> 13:51.597
OMG. Satin.

13:52.699 --> 13:54.033
We made it to "Shark Tank,"

13:54.033 --> 13:56.736
and we made a deal
with Lori and Emma?

13:58.871 --> 14:01.908
This is to tell you
to follow your dreams.

14:01.908 --> 14:02.909
Follow your passion.

14:02.909 --> 14:04.811
If you have a passion,
go for it.

14:04.811 --> 14:06.779
Don't let anybody stop you.

14:10.083 --> 14:13.186
I was born in East London
in England.

14:13.186 --> 14:16.923
I was raised by a single mum
with very little means,

14:16.923 --> 14:18.825
one of four girls.

14:18.825 --> 14:20.259
My mum went out to work
every single day,

14:20.259 --> 14:23.930
so I played a really big role
in raising my sisters.

14:23.930 --> 14:26.966
I watched my mum
work incredibly hard,

14:26.966 --> 14:28.968
and she really taught me
that I could do anything,

14:28.968 --> 14:31.771
so long as you are willing
to work really hard for it.

14:31.771 --> 14:35.041
I always had a huge passion
for fashion,

14:35.041 --> 14:37.677
and I would save
every little penny

14:37.677 --> 14:39.178
so that I could buy
fashion magazines.

14:39.178 --> 14:42.782
Going to the London College of
Fashion was a huge break for me.

14:42.782 --> 14:45.318
It was the first time I'd been
able to be in the big city

14:45.318 --> 14:48.888
and surround myself with people
that were really like‐minded.

14:48.888 --> 14:51.057
After college, I landed a job

14:51.057 --> 14:52.291
in a fashion‐show
production company.

14:52.291 --> 14:54.827
All of the designers were doing
these incredible shows,

14:54.827 --> 14:57.029
but everybody needed
sponsorship money.

14:57.029 --> 15:00.733
And that's exactly how my first
business, ITB, was born,

15:00.733 --> 15:02.802
a fashion entertainment
marketing agency.

15:02.802 --> 15:04.971
After a decade,
I'd grown ITB to the point

15:04.971 --> 15:07.740
where I was lucky enough
to have my first exit.

15:07.740 --> 15:09.842
One of the proudest moments
in my life.

15:09.842 --> 15:12.879
After 10 years of working
in the fashion business,

15:12.879 --> 15:15.047
I really understood that
the large majority of women

15:15.047 --> 15:17.550
were left out
of the fashion conversation

15:17.550 --> 15:18.785
because of their size.

15:18.785 --> 15:21.687
In 2016, I founded Good American

15:21.687 --> 15:23.156
with my business partner,
Khloé Kardashian.

15:23.156 --> 15:26.092
We are the first fully inclusive
apparel brand

15:26.092 --> 15:28.895
that's really made
for all women's bodies.

15:28.895 --> 15:32.965
On our first day of business, we
sold $1 million worth of denim,

15:32.965 --> 15:34.967
making it the biggest
denim launch of all time.

15:34.967 --> 15:37.804
My role is C. E. O.
and co‐founder,

15:37.804 --> 15:39.739
and I'm a very operational
C. E. O.

15:39.739 --> 15:40.773
I'm in the weeds.

15:40.773 --> 15:42.875
I work across every area
of the business.

15:42.875 --> 15:46.846
In 2019, I became
the founding partner of SKIMS,

15:46.846 --> 15:49.215
which is Kim Kardashian West's
shapewear and underwear brand.

15:49.215 --> 15:53.152
It's one of the greatest things
about being an entrepreneur,

15:53.152 --> 15:56.722
to start something from this
tiny seed of an idea

15:56.722 --> 15:58.591
and see it come to fruition.

15:58.591 --> 15:59.892
Okay, come on in, girls.

15:59.892 --> 16:01.861
I'm really passionate

16:01.861 --> 16:04.197
about women being able to start
their own business,

16:04.197 --> 16:06.299
especially Black women
and women of color.

16:06.299 --> 16:09.769
We all know that those groups
of women are way left out

16:09.769 --> 16:11.070
of the funding conversation,

16:11.070 --> 16:13.940
and so the idea that I can be
part of helping someone

16:13.940 --> 16:16.676
to start their business
is a dream come true.

16:16.676 --> 16:19.545
So good, no?
I love that!

16:20.780 --> 16:23.683
"Shark Tank" says so much
about Americans

16:23.683 --> 16:25.885
and who we are as a country.

16:25.885 --> 16:27.053
Give a kiss.

16:27.053 --> 16:29.956
I came here to have
my own American dream,

16:29.956 --> 16:31.057
and I think it's incredible

16:31.057 --> 16:33.626
that this is like
a full‐circle moment for me,

16:33.626 --> 16:34.827
where I can help other people

16:34.827 --> 16:37.430
realize what it is
that they dream of.

16:49.909 --> 16:53.813
Next up is a healthier
version of an indulgence.

17:01.687 --> 17:02.922
Hi, Sharks.
I'm William.

17:02.922 --> 17:03.990
And I'm Kristen.

17:03.990 --> 17:06.025
We're a husband‐wife
dynamic duo,

17:06.025 --> 17:09.061
co‐founders of Uprising Food
from Cincinnati, Ohio.

17:09.061 --> 17:11.964
We're here today
seeking $500,000

17:11.964 --> 17:13.900
for 3% equity
in our company.

17:13.900 --> 17:14.934
‐Oh.
‐

17:14.934 --> 17:15.935
‐Hello.
‐Hello.

17:15.935 --> 17:17.937
Sharks, we want
to revolutionize health,

17:17.937 --> 17:19.739
and it starts with bread.

17:19.739 --> 17:21.641
We teamed up
with the best

17:21.641 --> 17:23.743
artisan bakers in the industry
to bring you

17:23.743 --> 17:25.611
the healthiest,
tastiest,

17:25.611 --> 17:27.713
most powerful bread
in the game.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.815
And did we mention
our bread,

17:29.815 --> 17:32.051
also known
as the Uprising Cube,

17:32.051 --> 17:36.722
is keto, paleo,
and boosts gut health?

17:36.722 --> 17:40.192
That's right.
And it's dairy and gluten free.

17:40.192 --> 17:42.695
Some say it even tastes like
it's straight out of Heaven.

17:44.931 --> 17:47.099
We've truly done
the impossible.

17:47.099 --> 17:48.968
Our cubes are
packed with fiber

17:48.968 --> 17:51.904
and created with clean and
boosted superfood ingredients.

17:51.904 --> 17:54.874
Now, who wants to join
our health revolution

17:54.874 --> 17:56.842
and bring this
mouth‐watering,

17:56.842 --> 17:59.512
tastes‐like‐Heaven bread
to the masses?

17:59.512 --> 18:00.880
Whoo!
Whoo!

18:00.880 --> 18:03.049
Now, who wants
to taste Heaven?

18:03.049 --> 18:04.884
‐I want to taste Heaven.
‐What do we have here?

18:04.884 --> 18:08.654
So, what we have today
is for you to experience live

18:08.654 --> 18:10.590
the Uprising
grilled cheese.

18:10.590 --> 18:12.858
We also have
French toast.

18:12.858 --> 18:16.596
And this is just a plain piece
of the bread, right?

18:16.596 --> 18:17.129
Yes.
Yes, exactly.

18:17.129 --> 18:18.798
So, can I ‐‐
I'm gonna try that, too.

18:18.798 --> 18:19.899
Go ahead.
Jump right in.

18:19.899 --> 18:22.602
So, we didn't just
stop at bread.

18:22.602 --> 18:24.837
We also created chips.

18:24.837 --> 18:26.806
And, yes,
we have sales on both.

18:26.806 --> 18:28.874
We are brand builders
through and through.

18:28.874 --> 18:30.710
I worked
at Procter & Gamble,

18:30.710 --> 18:32.945
and Kristen works at
another CPG company.

18:32.945 --> 18:37.216
It's important to us
that we bring an aesthetic

18:37.216 --> 18:41.087
and an inspiration to
our brand‐building efforts.

18:41.087 --> 18:43.990
It's got a little bit
of a sponginess to it,

18:43.990 --> 18:45.725
almost like a cake‐like quality.
Yeah, it's chewy.
It's really chewy.

18:45.725 --> 18:46.792
‐Exactly.
‐Spongy.

18:46.792 --> 18:48.227
And what is that?
What's with that?

18:48.227 --> 18:51.263
So, that is designed on purpose
because we want you

18:51.263 --> 18:54.900
to have a very specific
mouthfeel with this bread.

18:54.900 --> 18:58.404
This lasts one to four weeks
in the fridge?

18:59.572 --> 19:00.840
Yes.
That's amazing.

19:00.840 --> 19:02.208
And that's
with no preservatives.

19:02.208 --> 19:04.010
I'm gonna give you
a little credit for the taste,

19:04.010 --> 19:05.945
'cause I've tried a lot
of these products,

19:05.945 --> 19:07.146
and they taste
like utter

19:07.146 --> 19:08.881
The bread is good.
And this is pretty good.

19:08.881 --> 19:10.783
What does this cost?
How much?

19:10.783 --> 19:11.917
That goes
for $12 right there.

19:11.917 --> 19:13.085
‐Whoa.
‐Whoa.
‐Yes.

19:13.085 --> 19:14.654
For a little loaf
of bread like that?

19:14.654 --> 19:15.655
‐Yes.
‐Whoa.

19:15.655 --> 19:16.355
There's a lot of power
in that.

19:16.355 --> 19:18.924
Guys, I think the bread tastes
absolutely delicious,

19:18.924 --> 19:20.893
but I just can't get
over the price.

19:20.893 --> 19:22.962
Like, 12 bucks
for this tiny, little, like,

19:22.962 --> 19:24.030
half a loaf of bread?

19:24.030 --> 19:25.931
How does that compare
in the markets?

19:25.931 --> 19:28.501
Like, I want to find a $5 bill
in the bread.

19:28.501 --> 19:29.135
Do you know what I mean?

19:29.135 --> 19:31.671
I don't understand that.

19:31.671 --> 19:34.006
This is not
a "basic bread."

19:34.006 --> 19:36.142
We're looking
to upgrade bread.

19:36.142 --> 19:39.578
Americans are, quite frankly,
getting sick

19:39.578 --> 19:40.813
because of the foods

19:40.813 --> 19:43.149
that were industrialized
and scaled.

19:43.149 --> 19:45.785
My father
is the type of person

19:45.785 --> 19:47.253
who represents
the masses.

19:47.253 --> 19:50.089
Now he's an annuity
for the medical system.

19:50.089 --> 19:52.525
He was given
four weeks to live.

19:52.525 --> 19:54.093
We intervened with food,

19:54.093 --> 19:55.961
and my dad
is still here today.

19:55.961 --> 19:58.731
When we think about
what we're doing here,

19:58.731 --> 20:01.033
it's not about us
being successful.

20:01.033 --> 20:04.970
It's about the mission
of helping people,

20:04.970 --> 20:07.106
and we will drive success

20:07.106 --> 20:09.942
by solving this problem
for society.

20:09.942 --> 20:11.944
So, I agree with
everything you're saying,

20:11.944 --> 20:14.013
and I totally agree
about the disease factor.

20:14.013 --> 20:17.149
My dad died from that,
basically same issue.

20:17.149 --> 20:19.852
Irish guy, lots of starch,
lots of white flour.

20:19.852 --> 20:20.920
Killed him.

20:20.920 --> 20:22.855
But not everybody in America
can afford,

20:22.855 --> 20:23.989
for 8 slices, $12.

20:23.989 --> 20:25.758
That's really expensive.

20:25.758 --> 20:26.826
Yeah.
Exactly.

20:26.826 --> 20:28.060
What are the revenues
of this business?

20:28.060 --> 20:30.830
So, first year
in business ‐‐ 2019 ‐‐

20:30.830 --> 20:33.032
- we did 85
- K top line.

20:33.032 --> 20:35.935
Second year in business ‐‐
2020, the pandemic hits ‐‐

20:35.935 --> 20:38.871
we did just under a million
top line.

20:38.871 --> 20:40.806
How's that possible?
What did you do?

20:40.806 --> 20:41.941
Well, hold on.

20:41.941 --> 20:42.942
It gets better.
‐Okay.

20:42.942 --> 20:44.944
First 6 months
of 2021 ‐‐

20:44.944 --> 20:46.712
$2.1 million
year to date.

20:46.712 --> 20:47.747
‐Pretty good.
‐Oh, hello.

20:47.747 --> 20:49.615
I almost want
to ask you for proof.

20:50.716 --> 20:52.251
We're experts
at digital marketing.

20:52.251 --> 20:54.286
So, right now, we can
deliver a consumer

20:54.286 --> 20:57.289
for just under $50
customer acquisition cost.

20:57.289 --> 20:59.825
That's a lot.
That is a lot
for what you sell.

20:59.825 --> 21:00.893
Well ‐‐

21:00.893 --> 21:01.994
Because you need
a lifetime customer

21:01.994 --> 21:03.629
to overcome that initial ‐‐
Bingo.

21:03.629 --> 21:04.130
Yeah.
Bingo.

21:04.130 --> 21:06.132
It <i>would</i> be a lot
if we weren't

21:06.132 --> 21:08.200
in such a high‐frequency
consumable.

21:08.200 --> 21:10.169
But, guys, we've got to
get to grips with these numbers,

21:10.169 --> 21:12.605
because the sales last year
were really impressive,

21:12.605 --> 21:13.072
but what's your profit?

21:13.072 --> 21:14.940
We are not cash‐flow
positive yet.

21:14.940 --> 21:19.745
We have just under
a million in net losses.

21:19.745 --> 21:22.014
Sorry, for the last year?
Wow.

21:22.014 --> 21:26.018
Yes.
We sell one loaf for $12.

21:26.018 --> 21:29.088
That costs us
$5.25 to make.

21:29.088 --> 21:30.756
Well, let's talk shipping.

21:30.756 --> 21:32.691
Once you take that down
for shipping,

21:32.691 --> 21:34.026
we clear
about a 30% margin

21:34.026 --> 21:35.161
once you average
our bundles together.
So, you pay for shipping,

21:35.161 --> 21:38.264
and you make
about $3.60 per loaf?
Yep.

21:38.264 --> 21:43.002
$500,000 for 3% imputes
a $16.6 million valuation.

21:43.002 --> 21:45.971
Explain why
you're worth $16.6 million.

21:45.971 --> 21:48.908
Okay. We're on track to do
$5 million this year.

21:48.908 --> 21:51.844
As you've heard, we've done
$2.1 million year to date.

21:51.844 --> 21:53.913
Other companies like us,
we believe,

21:53.913 --> 21:56.148
- can get a 6
- X multiple
in market.

21:56.148 --> 21:57.183
But you don't
make money yet.

21:57.183 --> 21:58.751
Are you saying
you're gonna make money

21:58.751 --> 21:59.785
if you hit $5 million
this year?

21:59.785 --> 22:01.187
No. Absolutely not.
No.

22:01.187 --> 22:03.122
So, when do you
become profitable? Ever?

22:03.122 --> 22:05.191
Uh, we ‐‐ we will
become profitable

22:05.191 --> 22:07.793
when we reach a certain
level of scale.

22:07.793 --> 22:08.761
‐What is that?
‐No kidding.

22:08.761 --> 22:09.895
You will become profitable

22:09.895 --> 22:11.197
when you reach
a certain level of scale.

22:11.197 --> 22:13.632
Our goal is to drive
top‐line revenue.

22:13.632 --> 22:14.600
No

22:24.777 --> 22:26.879
All Sharks are still in,

22:26.879 --> 22:28.914
but they are concerned
about the lack of profits

22:28.914 --> 22:31.817
for William and Kristen's
healthy‐bread company,

22:31.817 --> 22:33.819
Uprising Food.

22:33.819 --> 22:34.920
Are you saying
you're gonna make money

22:34.920 --> 22:35.921
if you hit $5 million
this year?

22:35.921 --> 22:37.256
No. Absolutely not.
No.

22:37.256 --> 22:39.091
So, when do you
become profitable? Ever?

22:39.091 --> 22:40.960
Our goal is to drive
top‐line revenue.

22:40.960 --> 22:42.962
No

22:42.962 --> 22:44.096
What is your exit strategy?

22:44.096 --> 22:46.932
Yeah, we would like
to either exit the company

22:46.932 --> 22:50.236
to a larger multinational
or we could foresee

22:50.236 --> 22:52.137
taking this company
public at some point.

22:52.137 --> 22:56.008
I don't think I've ever sat
and spent this time in my seat

22:56.008 --> 22:58.177
and heard more fancy words...

22:58.177 --> 23:00.145
...in my entire life, alright?
Okay.

23:00.145 --> 23:02.715
I think if I were to put
any money into your business,

23:02.715 --> 23:04.650
I would not sleep a wink
tonight.

23:04.650 --> 23:05.284
Wow. Okay.

23:05.284 --> 23:08.554
It's not even a business
that I'm listening about.

23:08.554 --> 23:09.088
It's a cause.

23:09.088 --> 23:11.891
The uprising.
The battle has begun.

23:11.891 --> 23:13.959
But the bottom line here is

23:13.959 --> 23:18.097
I don't trust you
to even protect my money,

23:18.097 --> 23:20.733
and sadly, for me,
that's the reason I'm out.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.201
Let me tell you just
a quick thing ‐‐

23:22.201 --> 23:25.104
Here's ‐‐ I want to share
a few things with you.

23:25.104 --> 23:28.040
I like the concept
of healthier foods, right?

23:28.040 --> 23:29.975
And I do think
that down the road,

23:29.975 --> 23:31.243
it will have great potential,

23:31.243 --> 23:34.213
because this is on trend
for what people want.

23:34.213 --> 23:38.150
But sadly, it's also too big
an ask for me,

23:38.150 --> 23:41.587
your valuation,
so I'm sorry.

23:41.587 --> 23:42.721
I'm out.

23:42.721 --> 23:43.789
Okay.
Thank you, Lori.

23:43.789 --> 23:44.857
Thank you.

23:44.857 --> 23:49.161
I'm stuck as an investor
on this $500,000 for 3%.

23:49.161 --> 23:54.133
For this deal to work,
you're gonna have to exit

23:54.133 --> 23:56.869
at close to half a billion
valuation

23:56.869 --> 23:58.704
for me to get my money back.

23:58.704 --> 24:00.606
I'm out.
Okay.

24:00.606 --> 24:01.140
Okay. Thank you.

24:01.140 --> 24:03.075
Guys, I think
the product is great.

24:03.075 --> 24:05.044
You know, I consider myself
a foodie

24:05.044 --> 24:06.211
and definitely
a bread girl,

24:06.211 --> 24:08.914
and I thought this bread
was really, really great.

24:08.914 --> 24:11.216
But equally,
I think that the ‐‐

24:11.216 --> 24:14.119
you know, the sign of
a really good entrepreneur

24:14.119 --> 24:16.889
is to really know the climate
that you're in,

24:16.889 --> 24:19.224
and I think for, you know,
so many years now,

24:19.224 --> 24:21.961
those of us that are in
direct‐to‐consumer businesses

24:21.961 --> 24:24.063
have really been able to scale
our businesses

24:24.063 --> 24:25.898
and do exactly what you guys
said you were gonna do,

24:25.898 --> 24:27.166
chase the top line,

24:27.166 --> 24:31.737
without real consideration for
becoming a profitable business.

24:31.737 --> 24:32.938
You guys did not come in

24:32.938 --> 24:35.841
and demonstrate what your path
to profitability is.

24:35.841 --> 24:37.209
Great point.
You missed it.

24:37.209 --> 24:39.011
You spoke about all
of your order economics,

24:39.011 --> 24:40.212
which ain't that great,
by the way,

24:40.212 --> 24:42.681
'cause you're paying too much
to acquire the customer,

24:42.681 --> 24:43.782
and as everybody said,

24:43.782 --> 24:45.851
you're not profitable
on your first customers.

24:45.851 --> 24:48.554
So, I think for me,
you know, I'm out.

24:48.554 --> 24:49.154
Thank you.

24:49.154 --> 24:50.322
Yeah, guys, look...
So ‐‐

24:50.322 --> 24:53.058
...why don't you run the company
to be profitable now?

24:53.058 --> 24:57.096
Why did you go, after being
profitable by the month,

24:57.096 --> 24:59.098
to be able to sustain
all this?

24:59.098 --> 25:00.933
That's actually exactly
what we did, Mark.

25:00.933 --> 25:02.968
But you lost a million dollars.
We ‐‐ We ‐‐

25:02.968 --> 25:04.169
The journey to get here,

25:04.169 --> 25:07.006
we aggressively drove CAC
to the floor.

25:07.006 --> 25:11.010
We've been the number‐one
lowest CAC in the food ‐‐

25:11.010 --> 25:13.779
That's such
a nonsense parameter.

25:13.779 --> 25:15.147
You start small.

25:15.147 --> 25:18.250
You got a nice little product,
and whatever you do,

25:18.250 --> 25:21.186
you go door to door,
you go online, you sell locally,

25:21.186 --> 25:22.955
and you make money
and you grow,

25:22.955 --> 25:25.257
but now, your back is really
against the wall, right?

25:25.257 --> 25:27.159
'Cause you're losing money
on every sale.

25:27.159 --> 25:28.827
So, the more customers
you acquire,

25:28.827 --> 25:31.130
the more money you lose,
unless you can make sure

25:31.130 --> 25:33.132
that you're selling them
a whole lot more products,

25:33.132 --> 25:34.900
and your products
are expensive.

25:34.900 --> 25:37.770
And, you know,
the bread unsliced ‐‐

25:37.770 --> 25:38.937
you get it, and it's like...

25:38.937 --> 25:40.939
Ugh.
..."What do I do now?"

25:40.939 --> 25:41.974
‐Yeah.
‐You know?

25:41.974 --> 25:43.075
You gonna take a bite
out of it?

25:43.075 --> 25:46.745
That crust is actually
very important

25:46.745 --> 25:48.881
to preserving
the product.

25:48.881 --> 25:50.949
People buy that product

25:50.949 --> 25:53.852
for the trifecta
of three reasons.

25:53.852 --> 25:56.021
You can't find something
this healthy

25:56.021 --> 25:59.858
that tastes this good
that's this fresh.

25:59.858 --> 26:02.327
Then why don't you say that?

26:02.327 --> 26:04.296
Why don't you say that?
‐Because you say so much ‐‐

26:04.296 --> 26:05.998
That was the best thing
you've said all day.

26:05.998 --> 26:07.099
‐Yeah.
‐Exactly.

26:07.099 --> 26:08.233
That was the best sales pitch
you've made.

26:08.233 --> 26:10.936
The packaging that
you're looking at there

26:10.936 --> 26:13.972
is, unfortunately,
our gen‐two packaging,

26:13.972 --> 26:17.076
before we really dialed in
that positioning statement

26:17.076 --> 26:18.844
and figured out that
was the winning combo.

26:18.844 --> 26:20.145
Listen to the jargon.
You're driving me nuts.

26:20.145 --> 26:21.780
Okay, look ‐‐

26:21.780 --> 26:23.849
We are constantly
dialing ‐‐

26:23.849 --> 26:25.884
I know, I know. Shh, shh, shh.
Okay. Right.

26:25.884 --> 26:28.353
You're overselling
with all the jargon,

26:28.353 --> 26:31.156
when you have an authentically
good product, right?

26:31.156 --> 26:33.859
Your whole little speech
on crust

26:33.859 --> 26:35.094
is everything
you should be saying

26:35.094 --> 26:37.096
and just selling this
just because of that.

26:37.096 --> 26:39.998
I want a product that's going to
give me all these things

26:39.998 --> 26:42.034
that I can't get
from a sliced product.

26:42.034 --> 26:44.002
That's all you had to say.

26:44.002 --> 26:47.739
So, simplify, focus
on the product, and I'm out.

26:50.709 --> 26:51.944
Thank you, guys, so much.

26:51.944 --> 26:53.745
Good luck with the line.

26:53.745 --> 26:55.914
‐Thank you.
‐Thank you.

26:55.914 --> 26:59.017
I honestly think the Sharks
are out of their minds.

26:59.017 --> 27:01.086
I question what they
ate this morning.

27:01.086 --> 27:05.190
We know that our product
is changing people's health,

27:05.190 --> 27:07.226
and they
couldn't see that.

27:07.226 --> 27:08.794
I'm not sure
what's wrong with them.

27:21.106 --> 27:23.175
Next into the Tank is a product

27:23.175 --> 27:26.478
to keep your smallest
valuables safe.

27:34.920 --> 27:36.054
Hey, Sharks.

27:36.054 --> 27:38.924
I'm Lerin Lockwood,
and I'm from Burnet, Texas.

27:38.924 --> 27:43.061
I'm here seeking $150,000
in exchange for 15% equity

27:43.061 --> 27:45.030
in my company, Lion Latch.

27:45.030 --> 27:47.199
Sharks, some
of our most valuable

27:47.199 --> 27:50.869
and sentimental possessions
in life happen to also be

27:50.869 --> 27:52.104
some of the easiest to lose.

27:52.104 --> 27:56.008
Let's say, for example,
mm...your wedding ring.

27:56.008 --> 27:58.076
Help!
I've lost my wedding ring

27:58.076 --> 28:00.546
and I can't find it
anywhere!

28:01.046 --> 28:03.148
Look at poor Maggie.
She's lost her ring,

28:03.148 --> 28:06.118
and she's searched her bags,
the dirty laundry,

28:06.118 --> 28:09.154
and now she's resorted
to Dumpster‐diving in the trash

28:09.154 --> 28:11.256
in search
for her precious ring.

28:11.256 --> 28:13.926
Maggie, all of this
could have been avoided

28:13.926 --> 28:15.661
if you just had
a Lion Latch.

28:15.661 --> 28:17.095
What's a Lion Latch?

28:17.095 --> 28:18.430
Only the best thing ever.

28:18.430 --> 28:22.868
A small, secure container
to safely store your items.

28:22.868 --> 28:25.070
So, whatever goes
into this little cutie,

28:25.070 --> 28:27.940
you can rest assured
nothing is getting out.

28:27.940 --> 28:29.241
Try it for yourself.

28:29.241 --> 28:33.045
Simply place your ring
inside the container,

28:33.045 --> 28:35.214
slide the lid on
over the stem,

28:35.214 --> 28:38.050
and lock into place
with the carabineer ring

28:38.050 --> 28:39.818
by sliding it through
that little hole

28:39.818 --> 28:41.820
at the top of the stem.

28:41.820 --> 28:43.222
Lion Latch
helps you store

28:43.222 --> 28:45.891
your beloved items
safely and securely.

28:45.891 --> 28:48.160
You never have to
panic again.

28:48.160 --> 28:51.163
So, Sharks, who's ready to lock
in a deal with Lion Latch

28:51.163 --> 28:54.900
and say goodbye to losing
the small valuables you love?

28:55.267 --> 28:56.935
Thanks for the Lion Latch,
Lerin.

28:56.935 --> 28:58.704
See you, Sharks.

28:58.704 --> 29:00.572
‐Bye‐bye.
‐

29:01.106 --> 29:04.910
What's to stop you
from losing the Lion Latch?

29:04.910 --> 29:06.144
Great question, Barbara.

29:06.144 --> 29:10.115
I actually made this so you
could attach it to your keys,

29:10.115 --> 29:14.019
and then you can keep it
in your purse or your backpack,

29:14.019 --> 29:15.187
your gym bag.

29:15.187 --> 29:17.022
Your rings aren't just floating
around in your bag.

29:17.022 --> 29:18.724
Mr. Wonderful,
what you got in here?

29:18.724 --> 29:19.258
Did you get it open?

29:19.258 --> 29:20.926
Are these hearing aids?

29:20.926 --> 29:22.427
They are.
Thank you.

29:22.427 --> 29:24.963
I've been waiting 13 seasons
to give those to you.

29:24.963 --> 29:26.231
He's out.
Why do I need these?

29:26.231 --> 29:28.200
Oh, for your listening skills.
Thank you.

29:28.200 --> 29:29.868
Yes. You're welcome.
Whoa.

29:29.868 --> 29:31.036
That really endears me
to you.

29:31.036 --> 29:34.673
It's gonna help you get a deal
with me ‐‐ not.

29:35.907 --> 29:37.943
So, tell me, how did you
come up with this idea?

29:37.943 --> 29:41.246
I am a teacher and a coach,

29:41.246 --> 29:45.250
and I was newly engaged
and I was coaching softball,

29:45.250 --> 29:47.185
and despite the fact
my athletes

29:47.185 --> 29:49.988
have to take off their jewelry
for athletics,

29:49.988 --> 29:51.990
I thought I was an exception
to the rule.

29:51.990 --> 29:56.028
I never wanted to take this ring
off, and I caught a ball

29:56.028 --> 29:58.230
and it flattened my engagement
ring into my finger...

29:58.230 --> 30:00.065
Wow.
...and then it knocked out
a diamond,

30:00.065 --> 30:01.900
and I didn't find the diamond.

30:01.900 --> 30:04.069
Everyone has some kind of
lost‐jewelry story,

30:04.069 --> 30:06.938
and so,
this Dumpster reenactment

30:06.938 --> 30:08.206
is a story that I get
very frequently.

30:08.206 --> 30:11.343
- I originally 3
- D‐printed this
for myself,

30:11.343 --> 30:15.547
and then other teachers and
coaches and my student athletes

30:15.547 --> 30:16.248
wanted one.

30:16.248 --> 30:20.085
Well, it was gonna be $30
- to 3
- D‐print one for everyone,

30:20.085 --> 30:22.087
so why not manufacture it?

30:22.087 --> 30:23.155
So, have you sold
any of them?

30:23.155 --> 30:25.924
I've done $530,000...
What?!

30:25.924 --> 30:27.025
...to date.
Yes.

30:27.025 --> 30:27.993
And that's over
what period of time?

30:27.993 --> 30:29.061
Uh, five years.

30:29.061 --> 30:30.295
‐Oh, five.
‐Okay, what about this year?

30:30.295 --> 30:31.930
How many have you sold
in the last 12 months?

30:31.930 --> 30:33.332
In the last 12 months,
I've done ‐‐

30:33.332 --> 30:37.836
let's see ‐‐ last year,
- I did 230
- K, and I grossed 54.

30:37.836 --> 30:39.004
Netted?
You netted 54?

30:39.004 --> 30:41.039
Yes. Yes, I netted 54.
Yes, sir.

30:41.039 --> 30:43.075
And how much did you put into
the business to begin with?

30:43.075 --> 30:45.210
I didn't put any of my own money
in it, actually.

30:45.210 --> 30:47.713
So, you own 100%
of this product?

30:47.713 --> 30:48.980
‐I do.
‐Yeah!

30:48.980 --> 30:51.416
Good for you, girl.
That's Texas proud
right there.

30:51.416 --> 30:54.986
Are you still working your job,
or are you just doing this?

30:54.986 --> 30:56.988
Actually, I made the tough
decision this year

30:56.988 --> 30:58.323
to resign from teaching.

30:58.323 --> 31:00.058
What do you charge
for one of these things?

31:00.058 --> 31:02.160
Wholesale for $5,
retail for $10.

31:02.160 --> 31:03.829
And what does it cost you
to make one?

31:03.829 --> 31:05.764
About a buck 50.
Buck 50?

31:05.764 --> 31:06.465
‐Yes.
‐Wow.
‐Okay.

31:06.465 --> 31:09.901
But I've had such a struggle
with manufacturers, y'all.

31:09.901 --> 31:11.837
I've had three different
manufacturers.

31:11.837 --> 31:13.238
They couldn't keep up
with the demand.

31:13.238 --> 31:16.074
My family and my friends
were driving to Dallas

31:16.074 --> 31:18.243
to pick up product
and bring it home to me

31:18.243 --> 31:20.312
as I'm packing the orders.
Why?

31:20.312 --> 31:22.914
The reason I didn't have them
putting it directly in a package

31:22.914 --> 31:25.250
and shipping is 'cause
I needed it to come to me

31:25.250 --> 31:27.919
so I could do a second round
of quality control.

31:27.919 --> 31:29.054
‐That's crazy.
‐Here, wait, I'm ‐‐

31:29.054 --> 31:30.222
That's why I'm here.

31:30.222 --> 31:32.958
You're personally packing
one product at a time?

31:32.958 --> 31:34.159
Yes.
I'm still doing that.

31:34.159 --> 31:36.194
I don't understand.
How are you possibly
gonna scale

31:36.194 --> 31:38.196
if you have to sleep
seven hours a day?

31:38.196 --> 31:40.298
I quit teaching.
Kevin, you're missing this part.

31:40.298 --> 31:42.000
I did all that
full‐time teaching.

31:42.000 --> 31:43.935
‐No, I got the quit tea‐‐
‐He needs his hearing aids.

31:43.935 --> 31:46.705
I'm full time ‐‐
Put those in!

31:49.174 --> 31:51.109
You know what?
He's got to love you.

31:51.109 --> 31:53.945
So, it sounds like you
need to hire somebody

31:53.945 --> 31:55.914
to solve all these problems
for you.

31:55.914 --> 31:57.983
I just want
to give you money,

31:57.983 --> 31:59.384
and I want you
to go take it...

31:59.384 --> 32:02.287
And turn it into more.
...and then I get
more money.

32:02.287 --> 32:05.924
This is a struggle, though,
for all women that wear rings,

32:05.924 --> 32:08.093
but it can be used
for money, right?

32:08.093 --> 32:09.428
Mr. Wonderful, money, okay?

32:09.428 --> 32:12.097
I got it.
I got it.
Not just rings, earrings.

32:12.097 --> 32:13.865
So, if you're getting
your nails done,

32:13.865 --> 32:14.933
you got to take off
your rings,

32:14.933 --> 32:16.134
don't just drop them
in your purse.

32:16.134 --> 32:17.302
Are you going to work out?

32:17.302 --> 32:19.371
Don't just leave it
on the floor.
No, I'm not.

32:19.371 --> 32:22.007
I know you're not. I'm sorry.
I'm going to say to you
I'm out!

32:22.007 --> 32:23.141
I'm out, I'm out,
I'm out, I'm out!

32:23.141 --> 32:24.843
I was talking to Lori.

32:24.843 --> 32:25.944
I'm so sorry.

32:25.944 --> 32:28.113
Lerin, what you've
accomplished is amazing.

32:28.113 --> 32:30.182
Thank you.
But I just don't see this

32:30.182 --> 32:33.185
becoming the $10, $20, $50
million in sale business,

32:33.185 --> 32:37.956
and unfortunately,
for that reason, I'm out.

32:37.956 --> 32:40.292
Look, I‐I actually really admire
your tenacity.

32:40.292 --> 32:44.095
I think you come on and
completely lit this stage up.

32:44.095 --> 32:47.332
I'm not that interested
in this on its own,

32:47.332 --> 32:50.168
and so, I think,
for that reason, I'm out.

32:50.168 --> 32:52.037
Thank you, Emma.
You know what?

32:52.037 --> 32:55.106
Your only problem is you don't
have good manufacturing.

32:55.106 --> 32:56.975
Correct.
Not good enough.

32:56.975 --> 32:59.311
You need a manufacturer
that you can rely on,

32:59.311 --> 33:02.147
and there's plenty of factories
out there that need work.

33:02.147 --> 33:05.917
But it's not really
an investable business for me,

33:05.917 --> 33:08.286
I don't think, but it
can be a great one for you,

33:08.286 --> 33:11.790
and you only have to solve
one problem, and you can do it.

33:11.790 --> 33:13.091
You will do it.

33:13.091 --> 33:14.960
So, I'm sorry to say,

33:14.960 --> 33:16.828
I wish you the best,
but I'm out.

33:16.828 --> 33:19.264
Thank you, Lori.

33:19.264 --> 33:21.166
Well, I just wanted y'all
to know,

33:21.166 --> 33:23.168
I've been working on this
for five years, you know?

33:23.168 --> 33:25.003
The blood, sweat, and tears...
You're tired.

33:25.003 --> 33:26.938
...teaching all day,
coming home,

33:26.938 --> 33:28.273
trying to spend some time
with my family,

33:28.273 --> 33:29.508
and staying up late
and packing orders,

33:29.508 --> 33:33.111
and I really came here with the
hopes that y'all would help me.

33:33.111 --> 33:35.146
As I'm watching you,
you're like a dog on a bone.

33:35.146 --> 33:37.716
You can hang on that bone,
keep coming back,

33:37.716 --> 33:38.750
keep coming back.

33:38.750 --> 33:40.118
That's a rare quality,

33:40.118 --> 33:42.654
and it says to me you should be
an entrepreneur.

33:42.654 --> 33:43.188
Thank you.

33:43.188 --> 33:44.923
But you're business
is too small.

33:44.923 --> 33:46.858
I'm sorry,
but I'm out.

33:48.293 --> 33:50.195
We wish you good luck.
Thank you.

33:50.195 --> 33:52.330
Thank, y'all.
Bye, y'all.

33:52.330 --> 33:55.066
‐Thank you.
‐Good night, Lerin.

33:55.066 --> 33:57.068
I expected to get a deal.

33:57.068 --> 33:59.037
I'm a little sad about that,

33:59.037 --> 34:02.541
but my plan is to go back home
and get to work.

34:12.384 --> 34:15.220
Next up is
a business that cares about

34:15.220 --> 34:18.623
how something is made
as much as what is made.

34:26.932 --> 34:28.233
Hi, Sharks.

34:28.233 --> 34:30.302
I'm Patrick Robinson
from New York.

34:30.302 --> 34:34.172
Paskho, my company,
created Community‐Made.

34:34.172 --> 34:37.876
Community‐Made is transforming
how we manufacture

34:37.876 --> 34:39.411
and sell clothing
in the United States.

34:39.411 --> 34:43.181
We are mobilizing teams
of seamstresses, tailors,

34:43.181 --> 34:46.084
pattern makers
from underserved communities

34:46.084 --> 34:47.485
to make sustainable clothes.

34:47.485 --> 34:51.957
One of the places where this is
working today is Gee's Bend,

34:51.957 --> 34:56.161
a rural, small, remote community
in Alabama.

34:56.161 --> 34:58.897
Black quilters are famous there.

34:58.897 --> 35:01.166
Now, Paskho Community‐Made
is there,

35:01.166 --> 35:04.402
creating dignified jobs
that pay a living wage.

35:04.402 --> 35:08.039
We're ready to scale the success
we're having in Gee's Bend

35:08.039 --> 35:09.774
across America.

35:09.774 --> 35:11.142
Sharks, I'm asking you

35:11.142 --> 35:16.247
for $500,000 for 2.5%
of my company, Paskho.

35:16.247 --> 35:19.951
Together, we can do good
and make money.

35:19.951 --> 35:22.787
I know you, don't I?
You're a bit fashion famous.

35:22.787 --> 35:24.155
I have a long career.
Yes.

35:24.155 --> 35:26.091
I've been in this for 35 years.
You were at Gap before.

35:26.091 --> 35:27.859
I ran Gap Worldwide.
That's what
I'm most recently ‐‐

35:27.859 --> 35:29.260
Mm‐hmm.
I was at Giorgio Armani,

35:29.260 --> 35:33.164
then I did Perry Ellis,
Paco Rabanne, Anne Klein.

35:33.164 --> 35:35.300
I did a collection for Target.
Wow.

35:35.300 --> 35:37.969
That was great‐selling there.
Wow. You have quite a pedigree.

35:37.969 --> 35:39.037
You've been around.

35:39.037 --> 35:41.039
Well, you know,
I've been around,

35:41.039 --> 35:43.074
and that's why
I'm doing this.

35:43.074 --> 35:46.144
And Americans today
don't have jobs.

35:46.144 --> 35:49.014
In Gee's Bend, where I just
showed you, work's not there,

35:49.014 --> 35:50.215
and we're putting it there.

35:50.215 --> 35:53.184
All of these clothes are being
made right now in the U. S.

35:53.184 --> 35:55.086
So, we're a 6‐year‐old business
right now.

35:55.086 --> 35:58.089
2019, pre‐COVID,
we did $6.7 million.

35:58.089 --> 36:00.225
Wow.
So, I pick this up,

36:00.225 --> 36:03.061
and I thought,
"Ooh, these are cute."

36:03.061 --> 36:04.829
Like, these
are my cup of tea.

36:04.829 --> 36:07.032
This is extremely
nice fabric.

36:07.032 --> 36:09.634
What does a pair of pants
like these cost to make?

36:09.634 --> 36:11.036
$43 to make.

36:11.036 --> 36:14.205
$110 is the average cost
of one of our products.

36:14.205 --> 36:16.708
So, you're not offering
manufacturing facilities

36:16.708 --> 36:17.275
for anybody.

36:17.275 --> 36:18.877
It's for your own line
of clothes, right?

36:18.877 --> 36:21.112
Right now.
Right now, we are.

36:21.112 --> 36:23.915
So, what we're doing is we're
building pods across the U. S.

36:23.915 --> 36:25.050
We have one
in New York City,

36:25.050 --> 36:27.252
the first one we started
during the height of COVID.

36:27.252 --> 36:31.823
The one in Gee's Bend came
online a month ago.

36:31.823 --> 36:33.892
And so, now we're building more.

36:33.892 --> 36:35.093
What are your net profits?

36:35.093 --> 36:36.995
We're not profitable yet.

36:36.995 --> 36:39.064
Okay.
Okay.

36:39.064 --> 36:41.833
But our average cart
right now is $209.

36:41.833 --> 36:42.967
Uh‐huh.
Right?

36:42.967 --> 36:46.738
To acquire that customer,
it's costing us $95.

36:46.738 --> 36:47.706
That's a lot.

36:47.706 --> 36:48.306
Right? Yeah. It is.

36:48.306 --> 36:51.476
But to today,
we did $1.9 million.

36:51.476 --> 36:54.145
We're looking to finish
this year at $4.5 million.

36:54.145 --> 36:56.147
The last 12 ‐‐
Will you be profitable

36:56.147 --> 36:57.282
on the $4.5 million
in sales?

36:57.282 --> 36:58.883
No, we won't.
No, we won't.

36:58.883 --> 36:59.918
And if not,
what will your losses be?

36:59.918 --> 37:01.219
How big a hole
are you digging?

37:01.219 --> 37:04.456
We are digging
a few million dollars still.

37:04.456 --> 37:06.124
But, Patrick,
tell me this ‐‐
Why? Why?

37:06.124 --> 37:07.992
Now we're getting to it.
Okay.

37:07.992 --> 37:09.227
Because we're building.

37:09.227 --> 37:11.196
They're building out, they're
rapidly scaling our pods out.

37:11.196 --> 37:14.165
So, we were getting close to ‐‐
we were getting profitability

37:14.165 --> 37:17.402
at that $7 million
that we were in in 2019.

37:17.402 --> 37:20.839
Our revenue dropped in COVID,
and basically we ‐‐

37:20.839 --> 37:22.173
But, Patrick,
tell me this ‐‐

37:22.173 --> 37:24.142
I don't understand why
your revenue dropped, right?

37:24.142 --> 37:26.044
I run apparel companies.

37:26.044 --> 37:28.012
COVID was a killer
for anyone

37:28.012 --> 37:30.048
who's, you know,
selling dresses,

37:30.048 --> 37:31.783
selling prints,
selling sequins.

37:31.783 --> 37:33.184
I'm looking at essentially

37:33.184 --> 37:35.386
what looks like elevated
loungewear here, right?

37:35.386 --> 37:38.123
It's what everybody was
wearing during COVID.

37:38.123 --> 37:41.159
I know, because at SKIMS,
we couldn't keep anything in

37:41.159 --> 37:43.128
that looked
anything like this.

37:43.128 --> 37:45.330
So, I don't understand why your
sales decreased so badly.

37:45.330 --> 37:47.265
Supply chain.
We didn't have the supply.

37:47.265 --> 37:49.167
We hit a supply‐chain
nightmare.

37:49.167 --> 37:51.002
What was your
supply‐chain issue?

37:51.002 --> 37:53.104
We couldn't get the inventory
we wanted.

37:53.104 --> 37:55.240
So, we didn't build
Community‐Made

37:55.240 --> 37:57.408
until July of last year.
Ahh. Okay.

37:57.408 --> 37:59.978
So, you were buying
in a traditional manner.
We were buying all
of our product...

37:59.978 --> 38:01.346
So, you have a pivot
going on.

38:01.346 --> 38:04.282
So, when COVID hit,
you kind of pivoted

38:04.282 --> 38:06.851
into this new thing
called Community‐Made?

38:06.851 --> 38:07.919
Yes, sir. Yes.

38:07.919 --> 38:08.953
Okay.
Yes.

38:08.953 --> 38:11.189
What I'm trying to figure out
is pre‐pivot,

38:11.189 --> 38:12.924
how did you sell clothes

38:12.924 --> 38:14.425
to get to $6.7 million
in sales?

38:14.425 --> 38:17.328
Yeah.
Because post‐pivot,
it seems to be a challenge.

38:17.328 --> 38:18.963
That's my whole thing,
right?

38:18.963 --> 38:20.932
I think my big issue
with what you're doing

38:20.932 --> 38:22.467
is that
it hasn't caught light.

38:22.467 --> 38:25.303
I'm just wondering what isn't
hitting with the customers,

38:25.303 --> 38:27.172
and that's what I'm
really struggling with.

38:27.172 --> 38:29.174
Yeah, it's the conversation,
right?

38:29.174 --> 38:32.410
And I under‐‐
How do you build
the conversation

38:32.410 --> 38:36.981
out of that traditional place
of buying your ads, right?

38:36.981 --> 38:38.883
So, we're spending a great deal
to find ‐‐

38:38.883 --> 38:39.951
Absolutely,
and that's why

38:39.951 --> 38:41.019
we're in a beautiful
climate now, right?

38:41.019 --> 38:42.220
Social lets us story‐tell,

38:42.220 --> 38:44.155
and the beauty of what
you've created,

38:44.155 --> 38:45.490
is you've got
an incredible story.

38:45.490 --> 38:49.294
So, either you don't know how to
sell it and tell that story,

38:49.294 --> 38:51.362
or the customer just
simply isn't there for it.

38:51.362 --> 38:52.997
Yeah, Emma's exactly right,
right?

38:52.997 --> 38:54.999
Because with your story,
if it resonates,

38:54.999 --> 38:57.735
your cost of customer
acquisition with this

38:57.735 --> 38:59.304
shouldn't be $90, right?

38:59.304 --> 39:01.239
She could come out
with a new product,

39:01.239 --> 39:04.209
and, bam, hit the story
right there, right then.

39:04.209 --> 39:05.376
I go back
to Good American.

39:05.376 --> 39:07.979
You know, when we launched
that, we started talking

39:07.979 --> 39:10.949
about size inclusivity,
diversity,

39:10.949 --> 39:12.817
the premium denim market.
Yeah.

39:12.817 --> 39:14.185
With a one‐week run‐up,

39:14.185 --> 39:16.955
we sold a million dollars
of denim on day one.

39:16.955 --> 39:18.289
The customers
will just get it,

39:18.289 --> 39:20.158
and I just think
that there must be

39:20.158 --> 39:23.127
some kind of huge disconnect
in what you're doing.

39:23.127 --> 39:25.430
And I can't stress
this enough, right?

39:25.430 --> 39:27.565
We are at the beginning
of this story.

39:27.565 --> 39:31.236
I just ‐‐ And honestly ‐‐
Oh, but you're not, Patrick.
That's my only problem.

39:31.236 --> 39:33.104
Let me ask you one question.

39:33.104 --> 39:35.440
You are a very talented
designer,

39:35.440 --> 39:39.811
but have you ever been a C. E. O.
of a manufacturing business?

39:39.811 --> 39:41.646
No. No.

39:41.646 --> 39:43.948
I can tell.

39:43.948 --> 39:45.149
I don't know
where you are

39:45.149 --> 39:47.518
in the continuum of when your
story gets traction or not.

39:47.518 --> 39:51.055
I'm a very pragmatic
investor.
Yes, you are.

39:51.055 --> 39:52.423
I like to take half
a million dollars

39:52.423 --> 39:55.960
and pour it on a business model
that's already proven,

39:55.960 --> 39:58.196
so I'm just adding
gasoline to the fire.

39:58.196 --> 40:00.265
I don't think
your flame is lit yet.

40:00.265 --> 40:02.166
I really don't.
I'm out.

40:02.166 --> 40:06.037
Yeah. I‐I‐I disagree with you,
of course.

40:06.037 --> 40:07.171
I get it.
I disagree with you.

40:07.171 --> 40:09.974
But it's my $500,000,
and I'll cry if I want to.

40:09.974 --> 40:11.776
And that's why I get
to disagree with you.

40:11.776 --> 40:12.744
It's my business, right?

40:12.744 --> 40:14.312
Patrick, I have to say,

40:14.312 --> 40:16.047
when you gave
your presentation,

40:16.047 --> 40:17.882
you brought me
almost to tears.

40:17.882 --> 40:19.384
I thought that story
was so riveting.

40:19.384 --> 40:21.920
I can't imagine it
not resonating

40:21.920 --> 40:23.288
with everyone
who hears it.

40:23.288 --> 40:25.390
But you can't have
my investment

40:25.390 --> 40:28.092
because of the lack
of clarity.

40:28.092 --> 40:29.160
Okay.

40:29.160 --> 40:31.930
So, sadly, I must say,
for this reason, I'm out.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.998
Okay.
I completely understand,

40:33.998 --> 40:36.234
and I'm grateful
for all of your time.

40:36.234 --> 40:41.105
We're building something
that isn't built out there.

40:41.105 --> 40:43.574
I ‐‐ You know,
I was a fan of you.

40:43.574 --> 40:47.145
I remember reading about you
in <i>Vogue,</i> on the CFDA list.

40:47.145 --> 40:49.280
I knew your face the minute
you walked in here.

40:49.280 --> 40:51.382
I think you need to take
that same obsession

40:51.382 --> 40:54.252
that you have with how
you're making things

40:54.252 --> 40:57.989
and turn it into some kind of
obsession with your customers,

40:57.989 --> 40:59.023
'cause your customer
is speaking,

40:59.023 --> 41:00.892
and I don't think
you're listening.

41:00.892 --> 41:01.526
It isn't for me.

41:01.526 --> 41:03.127
I don't think it's
an investable opportunity,

41:03.127 --> 41:05.196
so I'm out,
but I really applaud you.

41:05.196 --> 41:06.998
Thank you.
As I'm sitting
next to somebody

41:06.998 --> 41:10.435
who's built a fabulous
clothing‐line brand...

41:10.435 --> 41:13.171
Yeah, an incredible one.
...and more and more,

41:13.171 --> 41:15.239
you know, I have not built
a clothing line.

41:15.239 --> 41:16.975
I wouldn't know
how to help you,

41:16.975 --> 41:19.043
and regretfully,
I'm out.

41:19.043 --> 41:21.279
Completely understand.

41:21.279 --> 41:23.815
Still one Shark left.
Mark Cuban.

41:24.449 --> 41:28.286
The problem is you haven't
figured out how to sell it yet,

41:28.286 --> 41:31.222
and I think Emma brings up
a great point, right?

41:31.222 --> 41:33.124
The way things were sold
five years ago ‐‐

41:33.124 --> 41:36.060
totally different than the way
it was sold four years ago,

41:36.060 --> 41:38.029
different than three,
than two.

41:38.029 --> 41:39.397
Now you have 15 seconds
on TikTok.

41:39.397 --> 41:41.065
If you're lucky,
you've got 30,

41:41.065 --> 41:42.400
and that's where
most products are sold,

41:42.400 --> 41:44.902
and that part,
you haven't figured out.

41:44.902 --> 41:46.304
So, I'm not gonna invest.

41:46.304 --> 41:48.506
I'm gonna go out because you
have to figure that out,

41:48.506 --> 41:51.075
and it's not easy to figure out,
but I wish you the best.

41:51.075 --> 41:52.176
We will.
Where we're going,

41:52.176 --> 41:53.411
what we're gonna build
is gonna be powerful.

41:53.411 --> 41:55.847
So, we'll get it done.
I have no doubt.

41:55.847 --> 41:56.948
Yeah.
We're gonna get it done.

41:56.948 --> 41:58.016
Thank you.

42:01.285 --> 42:03.087
What he was trying to do
is something

42:03.087 --> 42:05.123
completely different than
we've ever seen before.

42:05.123 --> 42:06.190
Yes.

42:06.190 --> 42:07.392
In the end,
I don't think customers

42:07.392 --> 42:09.293
are making their decisions
based on

42:09.293 --> 42:11.129
where something's made
right now.

42:11.129 --> 42:12.196
I think you nailed it.

42:12.196 --> 42:13.431
I mean, he doesn't
know how to sell it.

42:13.431 --> 42:16.034
He doesn't know how
to sell it.

42:16.034 --> 42:17.468
I didn't get a deal,

42:17.468 --> 42:20.238
but I'm still passionate
about this mission,

42:20.238 --> 42:22.473
I'm still passionate about
bringing jobs back to the U. S.

42:22.473 --> 42:25.676
They didn't get it, but we're
going to bring those jobs back.
