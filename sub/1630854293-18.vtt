WEBVTT

00:02.530 --> 00:03.780
<i>Previously on</i> SWAT...

00:03.980 --> 00:05.150
I was talking to Luiza Coles.
She's a matchmaker.

00:05.350 --> 00:06.990
I haven't been
on a date in 30 years.

00:07.190 --> 00:08.650
Maggie?

00:08.850 --> 00:09.760
I'm so sorry.

00:09.960 --> 00:11.590
How did you get through it
with Barb?

00:11.790 --> 00:13.190
I'm here for anything
that you need.

00:13.390 --> 00:15.330
Thank you for seeing more
in this man

00:15.530 --> 00:16.530
than just a badge.

00:16.730 --> 00:18.200
We did it.
(door opens)

00:18.400 --> 00:19.400
HONDO:
<i>Meet your granddaughter--</i>

00:19.600 --> 00:23.320
Vivienne Carmichael Harrelson.

00:25.890 --> 00:27.720
(Vivienne cooing)

00:29.390 --> 00:32.150
Okay, we got dinner for tonight,

00:32.350 --> 00:34.210
and boiling more
water for tea.

00:34.410 --> 00:36.620
Oh, no, no, no, no,
don't you get up.

00:36.820 --> 00:39.590
That's why I'm here--
so you can rest and recover.

00:39.790 --> 00:42.560
You're a godsend, Charice.
Well, how else

00:42.760 --> 00:44.760
am I gonna earn my spot as
the number one grandparent?

00:44.960 --> 00:47.860
(laughs)
I could hear our little lady
cackling from the bedroom.

00:48.060 --> 00:50.400
(Vivienne coos)
Hey, Vivienne. Oh, I can't wait

00:50.600 --> 00:52.400
till you start talking
for real, baby girl.

00:52.600 --> 00:54.270
Oh, she already has
so much to say.

00:54.470 --> 00:55.800
Mm-hmm.
Just like her mama.

00:56.000 --> 00:56.970
(both laugh)

00:57.170 --> 00:58.540
How you feeling?

00:58.740 --> 01:01.010
Uh, exactly like
the doctor said I would feel

01:01.210 --> 01:03.680
after getting my body cut open.

01:03.880 --> 01:06.450
(Vivienne cries)
Do you think she's getting sick?

01:06.650 --> 01:08.480
She's so fussy
this morning.

01:08.680 --> 01:10.280
Oh, no fever.

01:10.480 --> 01:11.950
Say "I'm just new
to the world."

01:12.150 --> 01:13.390
(crying)
Yes, I am.

01:13.590 --> 01:14.650
(Hondo and Charice laugh softly)

01:14.850 --> 01:16.820
You ready to go back
to work, Hondo?

01:17.020 --> 01:18.360
Mom, it's hard
to say I miss my team

01:18.560 --> 01:19.760
when they show up
with food every day.

01:19.960 --> 01:21.430
(chuckles)
I thought we were gonna have

01:21.630 --> 01:22.800
to kick Street and Chris
out last night.

01:23.000 --> 01:26.470
I had no idea Street was
such a baby person.

01:26.670 --> 01:28.570
Well, I can't start spoiling her
till you get out of here.

01:28.770 --> 01:30.100
I already feel guilty leaving.

01:30.300 --> 01:32.710
Oh, no, don't. We'll be fine.

01:32.910 --> 01:34.270
I have done this before,
you know.

01:34.470 --> 01:37.510
I mean, you and your sister--
y'all turned out... okay.

01:37.710 --> 01:40.710
(laughs)
See? See? My mama got jokes.

01:40.910 --> 01:42.010
(laughter)

01:42.220 --> 01:44.020
All right,
I'm out of here. Mwah.
Mmm.

01:44.220 --> 01:45.380
(Vivienne cries)

01:45.580 --> 01:48.020
I love you both.
Love you.

01:48.220 --> 01:49.590
So fine.

01:49.790 --> 01:51.940
Look at that little lip.

01:57.380 --> 01:59.600
You're quiet this morning.

01:59.800 --> 02:01.800
How was the date
last night?

02:02.000 --> 02:03.070
Told you,

02:03.270 --> 02:05.240
I got a cute niece
I could set you up with.

02:05.440 --> 02:06.710
Thanks, but no thanks.

02:06.910 --> 02:08.410
That'd be like dating
the boss's daughter.

02:08.610 --> 02:11.380
I'm just saying,
you could do a lot worse.

02:11.580 --> 02:14.380
Actually, I know for a fact,
you <i>have</i> done a whole lot worse.

02:14.580 --> 02:15.610
(laughs)
Hold on!

02:15.810 --> 02:17.520
(tires squeal, man grunts)

02:17.720 --> 02:19.690
These clowns are lucky I didn't

02:19.890 --> 02:21.850
run 'em over.
You believe this?

02:22.050 --> 02:23.990
(horn honking)

02:24.190 --> 02:26.040
Wait. Where'd he go?

02:26.740 --> 02:28.460
(beep)
Wait. What's happening?

02:28.660 --> 02:30.650
I don't like this.

02:33.620 --> 02:35.150
(screaming)

02:36.790 --> 02:38.470
This is the jumper
for truck 6-3-8.

02:38.670 --> 02:40.970
Truck has been disabled
by an explosive.

02:41.170 --> 02:43.740
We are being held up near
San Pedro and 7th Street.

02:43.940 --> 02:45.380
No, stay put.
Help is on the way.

02:45.580 --> 02:46.800
I don't want to die in here.

02:48.500 --> 02:51.500
Open the door, or we'll
blow you up. Choice is yours.

02:52.370 --> 02:54.190
I can't breathe!
I got to get out!

02:54.390 --> 02:56.220
Jeff, no! We are
safer in here.

02:56.420 --> 02:58.560
No, wait.
I'll do whatever you want.

02:58.760 --> 03:01.010
Please, don't kill me.
Please, don't kill me.

03:01.710 --> 03:04.110
Open it. Now.
Okay.

03:09.390 --> 03:11.790
We've only got a few minutes.
You know what we're after!

03:13.020 --> 03:15.770
(buzzing)

03:15.970 --> 03:18.260
It's not here.
This one, either.

03:19.030 --> 03:21.450
It's not in any of these cases!

03:21.650 --> 03:23.520
(sirens wailing)
Police are here.

03:23.720 --> 03:26.130
(tires screeching)

03:28.640 --> 03:30.140
Here! I found it!

03:30.940 --> 03:33.330
We've got it!
Let's go. Move!

03:33.530 --> 03:34.360
(siren wailing)

03:34.560 --> 03:35.730
Go!
Cover me!

03:35.930 --> 03:37.750
Let's move! With me! This way!

03:42.450 --> 03:45.440
(groans)
6-Adam-27. Shots fired.
Officer down.

03:45.640 --> 03:47.470
Covering now at 7th Street.

03:47.670 --> 03:49.930
Suspects fleeing
into homeless encampment.

03:51.430 --> 03:53.280
I appreciate
you taking the time, Bob.

03:53.480 --> 03:55.310
I'm so embarrassed,
I almost couldn't

03:55.510 --> 03:56.720
bring myself to come to you.

03:56.920 --> 03:58.280
Oh, don't be ridiculous, Maggie.

03:58.480 --> 03:59.650
I'd do anything for you.
(sighs)

03:59.850 --> 04:01.390
Just tell me
what's going on.

04:01.590 --> 04:04.220
Well, you know how Martin always
handled all the home stuff.

04:04.420 --> 04:05.590
Right?
Yeah.

04:05.790 --> 04:07.230
Okay, well, I hired a roofer,

04:07.430 --> 04:10.700
paid him a deposit, and now,
he's run off with the money.

04:10.900 --> 04:12.870
Well, that's nothing
to be embarrassed about.

04:13.070 --> 04:14.630
Did you have a contract?
I did not.

04:14.830 --> 04:17.440
Uh, he was kind of a friend,

04:17.640 --> 04:19.100
you know,
doing it as a favor.

04:19.300 --> 04:20.470
Oh, no. (laughs)

04:20.670 --> 04:22.580
I'm sorry, Maggie.
I'm a little confused.

04:22.780 --> 04:24.340
If this is someone
you know...

04:24.540 --> 04:26.350
It isn't. It... (sighs)

04:26.550 --> 04:28.380
Not really.

04:28.580 --> 04:30.080
I met him on a dating site.

04:30.280 --> 04:33.620
Oh.
The girls encouraged me
to get back out there, you know?

04:33.820 --> 04:36.460
Time to dip my toes
back in the water, they said.

04:36.660 --> 04:38.090
That's good for you.

04:38.290 --> 04:40.730
(laughs) No.
Nah, that...
that-that's good.

04:40.930 --> 04:43.760
We only went out
a few times, so...
Mm.

04:43.960 --> 04:45.760
He dropped me off
one night after dinner,

04:45.960 --> 04:49.230
and fed me some line
about how my roof was sagging.

04:49.440 --> 04:53.140
He said he could fix it,
just needed money for materials.

04:53.340 --> 04:55.610
I paid him ten grand,
and he disappeared.

04:55.810 --> 04:57.310
Yeah.
Wow.

04:57.510 --> 05:00.000
Okay. (inhales sharply)

05:00.860 --> 05:01.980
You were so good to me

05:02.180 --> 05:03.680
last year
when Martin was killed.

05:03.880 --> 05:05.680
No. (mutters)
No.

05:05.880 --> 05:08.390
I wouldn't have gotten
through it without you.

05:08.590 --> 05:10.910
I hate to ask for more. I...

05:11.670 --> 05:13.060
Oh, don't be silly, Maggie.

05:13.260 --> 05:14.590
I'm always happy to help you.
(phone beeps)

05:14.790 --> 05:15.960
You know that.

05:16.160 --> 05:18.430
Ah. I'm so sorry.
This is...

05:18.630 --> 05:20.800
This requires my attention.

05:21.000 --> 05:22.600
I promise I'll look
into this roofer.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.600
Just send me whatever
information you have,

05:24.800 --> 05:26.740
and I'll get on it.
Thank you, Bob.

05:26.940 --> 05:30.180
You really are
a great friend. Mmm.

05:30.380 --> 05:32.900
(sirens wailing)

05:41.340 --> 05:42.790
HONDO:
Hey.

05:42.990 --> 05:44.420
You got eyes on any
of our four suspects?
No.

05:44.620 --> 05:46.160
We followed them in,
but they kept shooting at us.

05:46.360 --> 05:48.530
Too many innocent homeless
in there, so we pulled back.

05:48.730 --> 05:50.700
We've held the perimeter the
whole time, so they should still

05:50.900 --> 05:52.570
be in there.
Four male suspects.

05:52.770 --> 05:54.000
Probably Middle Eastern.

05:54.200 --> 05:55.930
One of them is wearing
a green bomber jacket.

05:56.130 --> 05:57.900
Any idea how many innocents
are in there with 'em?
No.

05:58.100 --> 05:59.640
We called out for them
to evacuate. A lot of 'em did,

05:59.840 --> 06:01.140
but...
You got to figure, for some,

06:01.340 --> 06:03.010
last thing they're gonna do
is listen to cops.

06:03.210 --> 06:04.610
Now you keep things locked up.
We'll take it from here.

06:04.810 --> 06:05.780
Copy.

06:05.980 --> 06:06.910
Hondo, we're going in blind.

06:07.110 --> 06:08.950
And they could be
hiding anywhere.

06:09.150 --> 06:11.650
With any number of hostages.
All right, we do a split search.

06:11.850 --> 06:13.390
Center out. Deac and Powell,
you're with me.

06:13.590 --> 06:15.350
Tan, Street, you take the south.
Keep sending updates.

06:15.550 --> 06:17.690
Hell of a first day back, boss.
(Hondo laughs)

06:17.890 --> 06:19.630
Don't I know it.
All right, heads on a swivel.

06:19.830 --> 06:22.880
Danger's in the unknown.
Let's move.

06:39.500 --> 06:40.480
Hey, hey.

06:40.680 --> 06:42.300
Get back inside.
Stay down low.

06:52.910 --> 06:54.290
Back in the tent.
Get back in the tent.

06:54.490 --> 06:55.710
Hondo, one o'clock.

06:57.480 --> 06:59.130
Go. 20-David.
We got eyes

06:59.330 --> 07:01.930
on a possible suspect
in a green bomber jacket.

07:02.130 --> 07:04.690
LAPD! Show us your hands!

07:05.390 --> 07:07.340
Don't move!

07:07.540 --> 07:09.640
(groans)
Roll over.

07:09.840 --> 07:10.640
(groans)

07:10.840 --> 07:12.550
They made me do it.

07:12.750 --> 07:13.950
He's not one of the suspects.

07:14.150 --> 07:15.450
Where'd you get
the jacket from?

07:15.650 --> 07:16.480
Guy gave it to me. He told me

07:16.680 --> 07:17.620
to put it on, I swear.

07:17.820 --> 07:19.150
Keep moving.

07:19.350 --> 07:20.690
Find some cover.
Don't go anywhere

07:20.890 --> 07:22.350
until you hear the all-clear.
Got it?

07:22.560 --> 07:23.740
(groans)

07:33.520 --> 07:34.730
(groans)

07:34.930 --> 07:38.200
Hey. Hey, buddy.
You with me?

07:38.400 --> 07:40.240
I'm just gonna see
what's going on under here.
(groans)

07:40.440 --> 07:41.640
Hey, Street, man, we
can't get medics in here

07:41.840 --> 07:44.780
till the camp's cleared.

07:44.980 --> 07:46.610
What's your name?
Cooper.

07:46.810 --> 07:48.280
Cooper, I'm gonna need you
to keep your eyes open, okay?

07:48.480 --> 07:50.880
Focus on me. Cooper,
talk to me. Where you from?

07:51.080 --> 07:52.750
Long Beach.
Oh, yeah?

07:52.950 --> 07:54.190
Yeah, me, too.

07:54.390 --> 07:55.920
Where'd you go to
school? Highland?

07:56.120 --> 07:58.860
Yeah. (coughs) Class of '02.

07:59.060 --> 08:01.780
That's a few years ahead of me.

08:02.550 --> 08:03.530
You a skater?

08:03.730 --> 08:05.600
Yeah.
Yeah?

08:05.800 --> 08:07.700
My whole life.
You weren't one
of the Gravity Wave boys,

08:07.900 --> 08:09.870
were you?

08:10.070 --> 08:11.140
Cooper Murphy?

08:11.340 --> 08:12.810
Yeah.
I remember you.

08:13.010 --> 08:14.210
I-I used to watch you
down at the skate park.

08:14.410 --> 08:15.710
I saw you all
do the stairs

08:15.910 --> 08:17.910
at Golden Shore once.
That was epic.

08:18.110 --> 08:19.440
We're gonna get you
some help, okay?

08:19.650 --> 08:21.250
Just hang in there. We're
gonna have you skating again

08:21.450 --> 08:23.780
in no time. Hey, Cooper,
hey, hey, stay with me. Stay.

08:23.980 --> 08:25.480
Hey, Cooper, stay with me.

08:25.680 --> 08:28.470
Stay with me, buddy. Cooper.

08:35.540 --> 08:36.760
HONDO:
20-David.

08:36.960 --> 08:37.930
We're at the back fence.
No sign of our suspects.

08:38.130 --> 08:39.450
How did we miss 'em?

08:40.920 --> 08:42.740
Hondo? Got an opening here.

08:42.940 --> 08:44.470
Leads through to the
adjoining building.

08:44.670 --> 08:46.040
They ghosted.

08:46.240 --> 08:48.560
They must have left
before we even got here.

08:54.660 --> 08:56.050
Patrol officer's
gonna make it.

08:56.250 --> 08:57.420
Same for the
armored car guard,

08:57.620 --> 08:59.020
but the driver
didn't stand a chance.

08:59.220 --> 09:00.590
They killed one
of the residents, too.

09:00.790 --> 09:01.850
Got caught
in their crossfire.

09:02.050 --> 09:03.290
Street tried,
but couldn't save him.

09:03.490 --> 09:06.070
Street all right?

09:06.880 --> 09:08.030
I don't know.

09:08.230 --> 09:10.500
Deac, we got any idea yet

09:10.700 --> 09:11.760
what these guys were after?

09:11.960 --> 09:13.070
No. But whatever it is,

09:13.270 --> 09:14.600
more than one witness
heard them say

09:14.800 --> 09:17.240
they've still got
four more to go.
Four more what?

09:17.440 --> 09:19.070
Left a whole truck
full of valuables.
Well,

09:19.270 --> 09:20.610
whatever they're after,
they're willing to kill for it.

09:20.810 --> 09:22.040
So as long as they're still

09:22.240 --> 09:24.430
out there looking,
no one's safe.

09:25.930 --> 09:28.100
* *

10:03.170 --> 10:04.780
Commander?
Yeah.

10:04.980 --> 10:08.390
Armored car company just
finished inventory on the truck.

10:08.590 --> 10:11.420
They confirmed
there was just one item missing.

10:11.620 --> 10:13.130
A necklace.

10:13.330 --> 10:15.960
Diamond encrusted,
one huge, central ruby.

10:16.160 --> 10:18.500
Well, it looks like something
you'd see on the red carpet.

10:18.700 --> 10:20.700
Insured for two million.

10:20.900 --> 10:22.800
Well, normally, I'd say
that's a pretty good haul.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.740
Except they left
ten million more

10:24.940 --> 10:26.370
of inventory
back on the truck.

10:26.570 --> 10:28.440
So this isn't
just about the money.

10:28.640 --> 10:30.310
That necklace must mean
something to 'em.

10:30.510 --> 10:31.640
Anything on the gunmen yet?
No.

10:31.840 --> 10:33.250
The only real
description we got is

10:33.450 --> 10:34.850
they might've been
Middle Eastern.

10:35.050 --> 10:37.650
May have something. Our friend
in the green jacket turned out

10:37.850 --> 10:39.080
to have a surprise
up his sleeve.

10:39.280 --> 10:40.950
There was a valet stub
in the inside pocket.

10:41.150 --> 10:42.860
It's from a restaurant
in West Hollywood.

10:43.060 --> 10:44.660
Well, at least that's a start.
Take Street and get over there

10:44.860 --> 10:46.190
and see if you can
find out something

10:46.390 --> 10:48.430
before these guys strike again.
DEACON:
Too late.

10:48.630 --> 10:50.460
I just got off the phone
with Beverly Hills PD.

10:50.660 --> 10:52.060
Same crew just hit a cafe

10:52.260 --> 10:54.070
on Rodeo Drive,
robbed a woman having lunch.

10:54.270 --> 10:56.230
Oh, let me guess.
Stole her jewelry?
Yeah.

10:56.430 --> 10:58.800
Yeah. No details yet, but
as soon as they get the report,

10:59.000 --> 11:00.870
BHPD is gonna send it over.
All right, good.
In the meantime,

11:01.070 --> 11:02.710
Powell, keep looking
into that necklace,

11:02.910 --> 11:04.340
see if you can figure out
what's so special

11:04.540 --> 11:06.930
that these guys had to have it.

11:10.670 --> 11:12.450
TAN:
Valet stand's busy.

11:12.650 --> 11:14.750
All right, appreciate it.
Thanks for trying.

11:14.950 --> 11:16.920
What's going on?
Everything good?

11:17.120 --> 11:19.090
I can't find any next-of-kin
for our homeless victim, Cooper.

11:19.290 --> 11:22.130
I mean, he grew up in foster
care, like me, but still,

11:22.330 --> 11:23.960
there has to be someone
who cares that he's dead.

11:24.160 --> 11:25.600
You knew him in
high school, right?

11:25.800 --> 11:27.430
You try any of
his old buddies?
Yeah.

11:27.630 --> 11:29.450
Check it out.

11:30.550 --> 11:32.570
Trying to dig up
their contacts.

11:32.770 --> 11:34.040
He was part of a skate group
called The Gravity Wave.

11:34.240 --> 11:36.570
Nate and I used to go
every day after school

11:36.780 --> 11:38.740
and watch them.
They were our heroes.

11:38.940 --> 11:41.080
Wow, what are the odds?
Shame to see

11:41.280 --> 11:42.350
where his life ended up.

11:42.550 --> 11:43.880
It just doesn't
make any sense.

11:44.080 --> 11:46.280
Cooper was next-level.
Got sponsored at, like, 14.

11:46.480 --> 11:47.950
Went pro at 18.

11:48.150 --> 11:49.790
And he still always
managed to make time

11:49.990 --> 11:52.420
to help out us newbies.
He taught me how to ollie.

11:52.620 --> 11:54.030
(chuckles)

11:54.230 --> 11:56.390
I mean, how does a guy like
that, friends all around,

11:56.590 --> 11:57.830
world at his feet,

11:58.030 --> 12:00.300
how does he end up
on the streets?

12:00.500 --> 12:01.800
No one to even claim
his body?

12:02.000 --> 12:03.870
Hey, I'm sure someone
out there cares about him.

12:04.070 --> 12:06.070
You'll find them.
Yeah. Hope you're right.

12:06.270 --> 12:08.510
Hi.
Hi. Help you with something?

12:08.710 --> 12:10.940
Yeah. We're LAPD.
Can you confirm this ticket

12:11.140 --> 12:12.880
came from your stand?
Yeah, that's one of ours.

12:13.080 --> 12:14.610
Any chance you can tell us
who it might've belonged to?

12:14.810 --> 12:16.820
Get us a license plate
or something?
Afraid not.

12:17.020 --> 12:19.580
Most I can give you
is the time the car

12:19.780 --> 12:21.550
was picked up.

12:21.750 --> 12:23.760
Uh, looks like
Wednesday afternoon,

12:23.960 --> 12:25.990
around 3:00 p.m.
Anything stick out
to you from then?

12:26.190 --> 12:27.530
Come on, man.

12:27.730 --> 12:28.860
We park 100 cars a day.
I wouldn't be able to remember

12:29.060 --> 12:30.430
one even if
I wanted to.

12:30.630 --> 12:32.850
That camera work?

12:34.150 --> 12:35.920
Yeah, I'd assume so.

12:38.090 --> 12:39.810
Tell us something good, Powell.

12:40.010 --> 12:41.910
Tan and Street just sent this
over from the valet stand.

12:42.110 --> 12:43.740
DEACON: That's a
familiar jacket.

12:43.940 --> 12:45.410
It's got to be our crew.

12:45.610 --> 12:47.250
Well, two of
the four, anyway.

12:47.450 --> 12:48.880
Let's run this image
through facial recognition.
(phone buzzing)

12:49.080 --> 12:51.320
And put a BOLO out
on that car ASAP.

12:51.520 --> 12:52.750
It's from Beverly Hills PD.

12:52.950 --> 12:54.450
They just uploaded
some of the info

12:54.650 --> 12:56.020
on the robbery
on Rodeo Drive.

12:56.220 --> 12:58.460
This time, the crew targeted
a yellow sapphire ring.

12:58.660 --> 13:00.590
Thankfully, the owner
had some photos taken

13:00.790 --> 13:02.930
for insurance purposes.
Yep. Got 'em here.

13:03.130 --> 13:04.830
DEACON: The victim said
they told her, "It's not

13:05.030 --> 13:06.630
stolen if it never
belonged to you."

13:06.830 --> 13:08.700
So we were right.
This isn't about the money.

13:08.900 --> 13:10.340
No. These guys are
only interested in

13:10.540 --> 13:11.900
these particular pieces.

13:12.100 --> 13:13.340
But why?

13:13.540 --> 13:14.810
Well, we got to figure out
what they have in common.

13:15.010 --> 13:16.510
We know this crew has
two pieces,

13:16.710 --> 13:17.980
but there's still
three more out there,

13:18.180 --> 13:19.680
which means
more potential victims.

13:19.880 --> 13:21.860
Hang on. Powell, zoom
in a sec, would you?

13:22.760 --> 13:24.450
See that? First, I thought
it was part of the design,

13:24.650 --> 13:26.350
but look at that insignia.

13:26.550 --> 13:27.850
No, that's a
jeweler's mark.

13:28.050 --> 13:29.920
It's the same on both pieces,
which means it was

13:30.120 --> 13:32.710
made by the same
person. Run it down.

13:34.810 --> 13:36.130
Hey, babe, everything okay?

13:36.330 --> 13:38.800
I'm not sure. I got up
from a nap a while ago

13:39.000 --> 13:40.630
and your mom's not here.

13:40.830 --> 13:43.070
Neither is Vivienne.
All right, well,
I haven't heard from her.

13:43.270 --> 13:44.870
She was probably
just letting you sleep.
Well, that's fine.

13:45.070 --> 13:46.770
But now I'm awake and it's time
for Vivienne to nurse.

13:46.970 --> 13:48.970
All right,
I'll try giving her a call.

13:49.170 --> 13:50.340
(sighs)

13:50.540 --> 13:51.840
Don't bother. She left

13:52.040 --> 13:53.780
her phone here.
I thought they went for a walk.

13:53.980 --> 13:55.780
But the stroller is here, too.
Should I be worried?

13:55.980 --> 13:58.650
Hey. Hey. I'm sure she's gonna
be back any minute. Look.

13:58.850 --> 14:00.750
Moms just isn't that good
about her phone.

14:00.950 --> 14:02.120
You're-you're probably right.

14:02.320 --> 14:03.360
I-I'll call you
when they get back.

14:03.560 --> 14:04.390
Hey.

14:04.590 --> 14:06.190
Everything's gonna be fine.

14:06.390 --> 14:07.530
Love you.

14:07.730 --> 14:09.010
And I love you.

14:12.210 --> 14:14.330
Commander, Powell's
running down a lead

14:14.530 --> 14:16.570
on the jeweler's mark. She
hopes to have something soon.

14:16.770 --> 14:18.870
All right, update me
when you know.
Okay.

14:19.070 --> 14:20.640
Is this a new suspect?

14:20.840 --> 14:21.940
Not in our case.

14:22.140 --> 14:23.680
My friend, Maggie,
she got ripped off

14:23.880 --> 14:25.810
by this jerk
from a dating site.

14:26.010 --> 14:27.850
Maggie. Is that
Judge Walker's widow?

14:28.050 --> 14:29.150
Yeah, she's already
been through enough

14:29.350 --> 14:30.920
without this happening, too.
Yeah.

14:31.120 --> 14:32.120
I've heard of
these Romeo scams.

14:32.320 --> 14:34.620
Romance someone,
gain their trust,

14:34.820 --> 14:36.490
take them for all they're worth.
Yeah.

14:36.690 --> 14:37.760
I can help if you want.

14:37.960 --> 14:39.460
Uh, thanks, but...

14:39.660 --> 14:40.960
I want to take
this guy down solo.

14:41.160 --> 14:43.930
Anyone who takes advantage
of a woman like Maggie, uh...

14:44.130 --> 14:46.600
they deserve
some real punishment.

14:46.800 --> 14:48.600
So...

14:48.800 --> 14:50.300
Maggie's dating?

14:50.500 --> 14:51.470
Huh.

14:51.670 --> 14:52.640
What?

14:52.840 --> 14:53.910
Nothing, just...

14:54.110 --> 14:55.910
I've heard you say
more than once

14:56.110 --> 14:57.280
that you guys have
a connection.

14:57.480 --> 14:58.680
You were working with
that matchmaker...

14:58.880 --> 15:00.210
We're just friends, Deacon.
That's it.

15:00.410 --> 15:01.950
Okay.

15:02.150 --> 15:04.500
We should all be lucky enough
to have a friend like you.

15:05.570 --> 15:07.220
I found the jeweler
who made both pieces.

15:07.420 --> 15:09.020
No answer, but he's got
an address downtown.

15:09.220 --> 15:10.860
All right, good work.
You two grab Hondo

15:11.060 --> 15:13.340
and see
what you can find out.

15:15.380 --> 15:17.530
Seems a little odd
to be closed

15:17.730 --> 15:20.150
in the middle of a weekday.

15:20.980 --> 15:22.770
POWELL:
Place has been trashed.

15:22.970 --> 15:25.150
No wonder
no one answered the phone.

15:27.320 --> 15:29.040
20-David to Command.

15:29.240 --> 15:30.710
Making entry
at the storefront.

15:30.910 --> 15:33.100
Signs of a possible burglary.

15:37.200 --> 15:39.620
Left side clear.
Right side clear.

15:39.820 --> 15:40.990
Case has been broken.

15:41.190 --> 15:43.360
They left the jewelry.

15:43.560 --> 15:45.260
That seems to be their
trademark at this point.

15:45.460 --> 15:46.690
HONDO:
Hey, Deacon, look.

15:46.890 --> 15:48.260
It's the designs
for the necklace and the ring.

15:48.460 --> 15:50.800
And those must be the other
three pieces they're after.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.460
Well, at least we know
what to look for now.

15:52.660 --> 15:54.850
Let's check the back.

16:00.590 --> 16:02.790
Got a body.

16:06.790 --> 16:08.180
He's dead.

16:08.380 --> 16:10.250
Looks like somebody
worked him over pretty good.

16:10.450 --> 16:12.580
They were probably
looking for info.

16:12.780 --> 16:13.990
(banging nearby)

16:14.190 --> 16:15.120
Hey, you hear that?

16:15.320 --> 16:18.170
It's coming from the vault.

16:20.340 --> 16:21.790
LAPD!

16:21.990 --> 16:23.530
Is somebody in there?

16:23.730 --> 16:24.900
We need you

16:25.100 --> 16:27.250
to come on out, hands up.

16:30.150 --> 16:31.300
Please!

16:31.500 --> 16:32.870
Don't shoot!

16:33.070 --> 16:34.640
DEACON:
Hey, it's okay, it's okay.
They're gone.

16:34.840 --> 16:36.010
They're gone, come on.
Come on.

16:36.210 --> 16:37.380
I ran in here
when they attacked.

16:37.580 --> 16:39.380
They couldn't get in.

16:39.580 --> 16:40.880
Mr. Harris.

16:41.080 --> 16:42.650
Is he okay?
I could hear them hurting him.

16:42.850 --> 16:44.680
I'm sorry. He didn't make it.

16:44.880 --> 16:46.650
Who are you?
What's your name?

16:46.850 --> 16:48.190
I'm...

16:48.390 --> 16:49.520
Juliet.

16:49.720 --> 16:51.320
Juliet Amato.
I'm Mr. Harris's apprentice.

16:51.520 --> 16:54.190
Juliet, did you hear what those
men wanted from Mr. Harris?

16:54.390 --> 16:56.960
They were demanding
that he turn over some jewels.

16:57.160 --> 16:58.330
He kept saying he didn't

16:58.530 --> 17:00.330
have them,
but they didn't believe him.

17:00.530 --> 17:02.820
All I could do was listen.
It was horrible.

17:03.720 --> 17:06.000
We found the designs
of these two pieces up front,

17:06.200 --> 17:07.440
along with three others.

17:07.640 --> 17:08.870
Did Mr. Harris make these?

17:09.070 --> 17:10.640
Yeah, those are
the pieces they wanted.

17:10.840 --> 17:12.580
They're part
of the Senses Collection.

17:12.780 --> 17:14.180
You know,
like the five senses?

17:14.380 --> 17:15.750
Juliet, the men who were here,

17:15.950 --> 17:16.980
they already have
these two pieces.

17:17.180 --> 17:18.320
We have to find the other three.

17:18.520 --> 17:20.090
Do you know where they are?
They were bought

17:20.290 --> 17:21.990
by Saturn Jewelry in Pasadena.
I handled the pickup.

17:22.190 --> 17:23.660
Deacon, alert Pasadena PD.

17:23.860 --> 17:26.790
We gotta get extra protection
on that jewelry store ASAP.

17:26.990 --> 17:28.060
They could be on
their way there now.

17:28.260 --> 17:30.100
We're gonna do the best we can

17:30.300 --> 17:32.050
to track down
who did this.

17:39.320 --> 17:41.470
DEACON:
Hondo, Powell?

17:41.670 --> 17:44.180
We got eyes on us
from across the street.

17:44.380 --> 17:46.880
POWELL:
That's one of the suspects

17:47.080 --> 17:48.880
from the valet stand.

17:49.080 --> 17:51.270
Is there another exit?

17:52.270 --> 17:54.290
All right,
give me 30 seconds,

17:54.490 --> 17:55.720
then make your move.

17:55.920 --> 17:58.110
Push him south.

18:01.280 --> 18:03.310
DEACON:
Stay out of sight.

18:19.830 --> 18:20.850
Hey! LAPD!

18:21.050 --> 18:23.470
LAPD! Don't move! Stop!

18:25.400 --> 18:26.580
LAPD! Stop!

18:26.780 --> 18:28.140
DEACON:
Hey!

18:30.340 --> 18:32.690
Don't even think about it!
On your stomach!

18:32.890 --> 18:34.910
Hands behind your back.

18:41.580 --> 18:44.200
HONDO: Adnan Ali.
No stranger to Interpol.

18:44.400 --> 18:45.770
Syrian national.

18:45.970 --> 18:47.210
Slipped into the country
a week ago.

18:47.410 --> 18:48.540
Three murders
and counting.

18:48.740 --> 18:50.040
That's quite a vacation
you're having.

18:50.240 --> 18:52.010
We know what you're after.
Unfortunately for you,

18:52.210 --> 18:55.080
the remaining pieces are
being heavily guarded now.

18:55.280 --> 18:56.780
So you and your
little band of thieves

18:56.980 --> 18:58.380
won't be able to get
your hands on them.

18:58.580 --> 18:59.820
No, we are not thieves.

19:00.020 --> 19:01.490
Your actions today
say different.

19:01.690 --> 19:03.020
Those jewels
were stolen from us.

19:03.220 --> 19:04.460
By greedy Americans.

19:04.660 --> 19:07.060
Stolen by Americans?
What are you talking about?

19:07.260 --> 19:10.800
The gems in those pieces were
looted by American soldiers.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.900
America said
they were going to help.

19:13.100 --> 19:15.330
Instead,
they pillage our homes,

19:15.530 --> 19:18.170
steal our history, one...

19:18.370 --> 19:20.870
one of our holiest books.

19:21.070 --> 19:22.540
You're saying
they stole a Koran.

19:22.740 --> 19:25.230
An ancient Koran,
passed down for centuries.

19:26.630 --> 19:28.550
Then they have
the audacity to deface it,

19:28.750 --> 19:30.550
ripping the jewels
from its cover.

19:30.750 --> 19:33.320
An ancient relic like that,

19:33.520 --> 19:34.920
it's got to be
worth millions.

19:35.120 --> 19:36.250
(scoffs)

19:36.450 --> 19:38.560
This isn't about money.

19:38.760 --> 19:40.390
This is about the disregard
of our people,

19:40.590 --> 19:42.760
the violation of our culture.

19:42.960 --> 19:45.400
All right, help me out here.
I thought the Koran

19:45.600 --> 19:46.860
teaches love and altruism?

19:47.060 --> 19:49.070
Yet you and your friends
killed three people today.

19:49.270 --> 19:51.340
You sound like
a hypocrite to me.

19:51.540 --> 19:53.540
Don't talk to me
about hypocrisy.

19:53.740 --> 19:55.910
It's disgusting to see

19:56.110 --> 19:57.940
Americans wearing
our religious relics

19:58.140 --> 19:59.980
as status symbols,
showing off their jewels

20:00.180 --> 20:03.380
with zero understanding
about any of the pain

20:03.580 --> 20:05.250
that they have caused us.

20:05.450 --> 20:07.050
They deserve to die.

20:07.250 --> 20:09.290
All right.

20:09.490 --> 20:11.640
Where's the Koran now?

20:13.170 --> 20:16.490
He doesn't know, or they'd
have gone after it already.

20:16.690 --> 20:19.130
Doesn't matter
what you do to me.

20:19.330 --> 20:21.270
My brothers will not rest

20:21.470 --> 20:22.900
until they restore the Koran

20:23.100 --> 20:26.190
and return it to our homeland
where it belongs.

20:30.330 --> 20:32.380
The remaining three pieces
may be locked up tight,

20:32.580 --> 20:33.750
but if the Koran
is still out there...

20:33.950 --> 20:35.210
We need to find it
before they do.

20:35.410 --> 20:36.350
Oh, come on, not again.

20:36.550 --> 20:37.750
Everything okay?

20:37.950 --> 20:40.150
I'm not sure. Nichelle's
stressed about the baby.

20:40.350 --> 20:42.690
My mom took Vivienne out, but
she doesn't know where she went.

20:42.890 --> 20:45.420
It has been a while now.
Go. We're good here.

20:45.620 --> 20:47.610
Yeah?
Yeah.

20:49.440 --> 20:51.130
TAN:
Whoa!

20:51.330 --> 20:52.600
Fridge make you mad
or something?

20:52.800 --> 20:54.680
Sorry, sorry.

20:56.380 --> 20:57.970
I, um...

20:58.170 --> 21:00.910
I managed to track down one
of the old Gravity Wave skaters.

21:01.110 --> 21:02.610
He was not exactly heartbroken
when I told him

21:02.810 --> 21:05.140
Cooper was dead.
In fact, he was more upset

21:05.340 --> 21:07.610
he wasn't gonna get back
the money Cooper still owed him.

21:07.810 --> 21:09.080
That sucks.

21:09.280 --> 21:11.320
You find out how Cooper
went from a pro skater

21:11.520 --> 21:12.850
to living on
the street?

21:13.050 --> 21:14.550
Yeah, he busted his knee,
couldn't skate for a while.

21:14.750 --> 21:16.620
Lost his sponsorship deal.

21:16.820 --> 21:19.260
All downhill from there.
He must've started

21:19.460 --> 21:20.990
borrowing money
from friends.

21:21.190 --> 21:22.930
Last resort,
he took to stealing.

21:23.130 --> 21:26.100
Did a few stints in County.
What a waste of talent.

21:26.300 --> 21:27.870
Yeah, the guy I spoke to,

21:28.070 --> 21:29.630
he said he doesn't know
how to get ahold

21:29.830 --> 21:31.900
of any of the other skaters
in the group.

21:32.100 --> 21:34.240
So no closer to finding
someone to handle the funeral?

21:34.440 --> 21:37.480
Which means he'll end up
in county mass grave.

21:37.680 --> 21:39.860
Not even a marker with his name.

21:40.660 --> 21:42.780
His death's hitting you hard.

21:42.980 --> 21:46.030
Is there, uh, something else
going on with you?

21:47.230 --> 21:49.970
Cooper and I were
about the same age.

21:51.110 --> 21:53.390
We both grew up
without a family.

21:53.590 --> 21:55.660
But I always envied him

21:55.860 --> 21:57.500
because the Gravity Wave...

21:57.700 --> 21:59.760
that seemed like a family.

21:59.960 --> 22:01.800
All it took
was one injury and...

22:02.000 --> 22:03.230
and that just all went away?

22:03.440 --> 22:05.070
He died alone.

22:05.270 --> 22:07.810
And what, think the same
could happen to you?

22:08.010 --> 22:10.410
Don't worry, Street, you're
not gonna die all alone.

22:10.610 --> 22:13.550
I will be at your funeral.
I'm gonna read the eulogy,

22:13.750 --> 22:15.280
I'll play a little
Nirvana to send you

22:15.480 --> 22:17.580
on your way.
Okay, thanks.

22:17.780 --> 22:19.550
I don't know,
I-I figure I...

22:19.750 --> 22:22.350
I'll keep trying.
Worst case,

22:22.550 --> 22:24.420
I'll organize a memorial myself,

22:24.620 --> 22:26.810
even if it's just me there.

22:30.950 --> 22:33.730
Commander,
this is Dr. Dena Rahimi.

22:33.930 --> 22:35.800
She's a professor of
Islamic Studies at UCLA.

22:36.000 --> 22:37.670
Also an
antiquities expert.

22:37.870 --> 22:39.070
It's good to meet
you, Dr. Rahimi.

22:39.270 --> 22:41.110
Is this the Koran that's
at the center of all this?

22:41.310 --> 22:43.710
Yes, it's one of
the oldest in existence.

22:43.910 --> 22:45.880
Was on display
in the Syrian National Museum,

22:46.080 --> 22:47.410
but went missing four years ago.

22:47.610 --> 22:50.180
A real blow
to the Muslim community to lose

22:50.380 --> 22:52.820
something of such religious
and cultural significance.

22:53.020 --> 22:56.290
You can understand
the outrage if it were pillaged

22:56.490 --> 22:57.860
by American troops.

22:58.060 --> 22:59.590
Well, the outrage, yes.
But the method and violence

22:59.790 --> 23:01.790
used to recover it, no.
I agree.

23:01.990 --> 23:03.700
Loosely translated,
the Koran says,

23:03.900 --> 23:05.530
"If anyone kills
an innocent person,

23:05.730 --> 23:06.930
it is like killing
all of humanity."

23:07.130 --> 23:08.970
If you get this Koran back,

23:09.170 --> 23:12.170
my team will make sure
it's returned to its home.

23:12.370 --> 23:14.070
Well, let's hope that's
a "when" and not an "if."

23:14.270 --> 23:15.740
We'll be in touch. Thank you.

23:15.940 --> 23:18.040
Inshallah, Commander.
Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

23:18.240 --> 23:19.960
(sighs)

23:21.400 --> 23:23.980
You still trying to track down
that jerk who scammed Maggie?

23:24.180 --> 23:26.450
Well, so far, there's nothing
in his profile that's legit.

23:26.650 --> 23:28.850
I mean,
the thing I don't get is,

23:29.050 --> 23:30.660
even if you buy
his line of crap,

23:30.860 --> 23:33.730
what the hell
did Maggie see in this guy?

23:33.930 --> 23:36.460
Look, um, I may have
overstepped earlier.
Well...

23:36.660 --> 23:39.430
So why not go all in,
and overstep again?

23:39.630 --> 23:42.330
(laughs)
This seems like more than
just a friendly favor.

23:42.530 --> 23:44.040
What's holding you back
from asking her out?

23:44.240 --> 23:45.240
Or are you not interested?

23:45.440 --> 23:46.900
Well...

23:47.100 --> 23:49.140
I won't say
I haven't thought about it.

23:49.340 --> 23:51.080
But Maggie's called me
a friend many times.

23:51.280 --> 23:53.180
It seems clear that
that's all I am to her.

23:53.380 --> 23:55.210
Okay, let me, let me
tell you something.

23:55.410 --> 23:57.380
When I realized that
I had feelings for Annie,

23:57.580 --> 24:00.380
I thought that I'd show her
that I'd do anything for her.

24:00.590 --> 24:01.820
I'd switch shifts

24:02.020 --> 24:03.560
to pick her up from
the airport, anything.

24:03.760 --> 24:05.860
I thought that
she'd figure it out.

24:06.060 --> 24:07.890
But when I finally got up
the guts to ask her out,

24:08.090 --> 24:09.490
she was surprised.

24:09.690 --> 24:11.000
She said that...

24:11.200 --> 24:12.700
she thought I only
saw her as a friend

24:12.900 --> 24:14.170
that whole time.

24:14.370 --> 24:15.970
And even though
she had feelings, too,

24:16.170 --> 24:17.740
she didn't act on them.

24:17.940 --> 24:19.540
Because she'd rather
have me as a friend

24:19.740 --> 24:21.070
than nothing at all.

24:21.270 --> 24:23.010
Hmm.

24:23.210 --> 24:26.640
She and Martin, they were
there for me when Barb died.

24:26.840 --> 24:28.850
I mean,
what if it's weird to her?

24:29.050 --> 24:30.920
I don't think that's
a line I should cross.

24:31.120 --> 24:33.400
No risk, no reward.

24:34.540 --> 24:38.010
I could've missed out
on my whole life with Annie.

24:42.280 --> 24:44.000
POWELL:
Have you ever seen
this book before?

24:44.200 --> 24:46.230
I recognize the jewels.

24:46.430 --> 24:48.930
They're the focal pieces for
the Five Senses collection.

24:49.130 --> 24:50.740
But the book...

24:50.940 --> 24:52.900
no. What is it?

24:53.100 --> 24:55.840
It's a Syrian Koran,
rare and extremely valuable.

24:56.040 --> 24:57.610
It was stolen
from a museum in Syria.

24:57.810 --> 24:59.780
This is
what these men are after.

24:59.980 --> 25:01.650
Oh, my God.

25:01.850 --> 25:03.050
They killed Mr. Harris for this?

25:03.250 --> 25:05.550
And two other innocent people.

25:05.750 --> 25:07.850
He was the kindest man.

25:08.050 --> 25:09.220
Let me sleep at the shop

25:09.420 --> 25:10.720
when I first moved to L.A.
after a breakup.

25:10.920 --> 25:12.190
We need to find this book.

25:12.390 --> 25:14.160
Do you have any idea
where it might be?

25:14.360 --> 25:15.630
No.

25:15.830 --> 25:16.960
How would I?

25:17.160 --> 25:18.300
Your boss had the five jewels.

25:18.500 --> 25:19.900
Can you think of how
he might've gotten

25:20.100 --> 25:21.370
his hands on them?
(sighs)

25:21.570 --> 25:23.600
Well, he had relationships
with all sorts

25:23.800 --> 25:25.300
of diamond and gem dealers.

25:25.500 --> 25:27.240
I don't know where
to begin. Uh, maybe

25:27.440 --> 25:28.670
there are purchase
records at the shop?

25:28.870 --> 25:30.410
If there were, they're gone now.

25:30.610 --> 25:32.640
Then I'm, I'm sorry.

25:32.840 --> 25:36.060
I wish I could help, but I don't
know what else to tell you.

25:38.900 --> 25:40.890
(door opens)
Nichelle?

25:41.090 --> 25:43.590
Hondo.
Hey. Is everything okay?

25:43.790 --> 25:45.760
I'm worried.
What if she fell?

25:45.960 --> 25:47.830
What if Vivienne got sick and
she took her to the hospital?

25:48.030 --> 25:49.730
Okay, listen. I'm gonna go
look for them right now.

25:49.930 --> 25:52.100
Momma's car is still here, so
she couldn't have gone too far.

25:52.300 --> 25:54.950
Will you just try to stay calm?
Okay.

25:56.250 --> 25:58.240
Hondo, what you doing home?

25:58.440 --> 25:59.640
Oh, thank God!
Momma, where have you been?

25:59.840 --> 26:01.670
Momma, where you been?

26:01.870 --> 26:02.870
She's sleeping.

26:03.070 --> 26:06.190
It's time for her to nurse.

26:08.000 --> 26:09.280
What is going on here?

26:09.480 --> 26:11.750
Do you know how
worried you had us?

26:11.950 --> 26:13.550
What? We weren't gone that long.

26:13.750 --> 26:16.190
Nichelle was terrified something
happened to you, to Vivienne.

26:16.390 --> 26:18.390
You left your phone here.
No note, nothing.

26:18.590 --> 26:20.220
I know I didn't raise you
to talk to me like that.

26:20.420 --> 26:22.930
You better take that bass
out of your voice.

26:23.130 --> 26:24.960
You said you came here
to help us.

26:25.160 --> 26:26.860
But all you did was
cause us grief,

26:27.060 --> 26:28.200
disappearing like that.
Hondo.

26:28.400 --> 26:30.470
It is my job
to keep Vivienne safe.

26:30.670 --> 26:32.140
That's what I was doing,
keeping her safe.

26:32.340 --> 26:34.210
Well, you can't tell
by how you acted today.

26:34.410 --> 26:36.810
It was my first day
back at work.

26:37.010 --> 26:39.180
Momma, just go home.

26:39.380 --> 26:41.360
Go home.

26:46.000 --> 26:48.570
(sighs)
(door closes)

26:51.370 --> 26:53.320
Commander,
we got a problem.

26:53.520 --> 26:55.060
One of the three remaining
jewels isn't where

26:55.260 --> 26:56.730
it's supposed to be.
What are you talking about?

26:56.930 --> 26:58.930
I thought they were all locked
up tight in a jewelry store

26:59.130 --> 27:01.000
in Pasadena.
They were, until the store's

27:01.200 --> 27:03.270
assistant manager loaned
one of them out to a rapper

27:03.470 --> 27:05.800
for a music video.
Oh, you got to be kidding me!

27:06.000 --> 27:07.370
Where is it now?

27:07.570 --> 27:09.610
Yo, how sick is this bling
they got me wearing today?

27:09.810 --> 27:11.280
Saturn Jewelry hooked it up!

27:11.480 --> 27:13.440
This is Slim K-O, baby.
We out here shooting my video.

27:13.640 --> 27:17.080
Damn it. He's showing the
whole world his location.

27:17.280 --> 27:18.620
And he geo-tagged
the jewelry store.

27:18.820 --> 27:20.120
If our suspects see this...

27:20.320 --> 27:21.620
Yeah, I'll try to get
ahold of the music label.

27:21.820 --> 27:24.010
You get over there now.

27:27.610 --> 27:29.460
Lot of civilians if
this went sideways.

27:29.660 --> 27:31.300
We need to get eyes
on Slim K-O and that necklace.

27:31.500 --> 27:32.860
I'll evacuate people
to the other side

27:33.060 --> 27:34.400
of the street, just in case.

27:34.600 --> 27:35.600
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

27:35.800 --> 27:37.330
Whatever the issue is,
we have permits.

27:37.530 --> 27:39.540
We're LAPD SWAT.
Where's Slim K-O?

27:39.740 --> 27:41.070
He's taking a break.
He's in his trailer.

27:41.270 --> 27:42.370
I'm his manager.
What's going on?

27:42.570 --> 27:44.010
Well, your client
could be a target.

27:44.210 --> 27:46.160
Which trailer?
Oh. Um...

27:49.660 --> 27:51.120
Hey, man.

27:51.320 --> 27:53.320
Yeah, I'm not doing
autographs today, all right?

27:53.520 --> 27:54.720
(groans)

27:54.920 --> 27:56.920
LAPD! Drop the weapon!

27:57.120 --> 28:00.670
(groans)
He took my chain, man.

28:03.010 --> 28:04.430
LAPD! Drop your weapon!

28:04.630 --> 28:06.180
Hey, get down!

28:06.950 --> 28:09.500
Suspect's headed back
into the set.

28:09.700 --> 28:11.120
Out of the way!

28:12.620 --> 28:14.610
(grunting)

28:14.810 --> 28:17.810
Stay down! You're done.
Give me your hands.

28:18.010 --> 28:20.340
(grunting)
It's nice work, right?

28:20.540 --> 28:22.050
Think they can use that
in the music video?

28:22.250 --> 28:23.820
Wasn't as pretty
as you think.

28:24.020 --> 28:25.180
DEACON: Hey,
laugh it up for now,

28:25.380 --> 28:26.880
but the Koran's still out there.

28:27.080 --> 28:31.610
And as long as they're still
hunting it, so are we.

28:38.110 --> 28:39.760
The gunman we apprehended
used some colorful language

28:39.960 --> 28:41.230
to tell us we could go to hell.

28:41.430 --> 28:43.300
There is no way he's telling us
where his buddies are,

28:43.500 --> 28:45.940
but you can bet they aren't
giving up without the Koran.

28:46.140 --> 28:48.110
I'm going through jewelry
invoices from the workshop,

28:48.310 --> 28:50.470
trying to figure out
where Harris got the jewels.

28:50.670 --> 28:52.180
So far, nothing.

28:52.380 --> 28:53.580
The Koran has
to be somewhere.

28:53.780 --> 28:55.210
Just got ballistics back
from the gun

28:55.410 --> 28:56.950
Adnan was carrying
in the jewelry store.

28:57.150 --> 29:00.180
Same weapon was used in a murder
three days ago in Phoenix.

29:00.380 --> 29:03.350
Phoenix? So L.A. wasn't this
crew's first stop in the U.S.?

29:03.550 --> 29:04.820
No, apparently not.
The victim's

29:05.020 --> 29:06.960
this guy--
Calvin Davis.

29:07.160 --> 29:10.030
Military, Army Reserves.
He served in Syria in 2019.

29:10.230 --> 29:12.660
Adnan said that the Koran
was looted by U.S. soldiers.

29:12.860 --> 29:14.030
Maybe they found their culprit?

29:14.230 --> 29:15.830
Well, that's exactly
what I was thinking.

29:16.030 --> 29:18.200
Calvin Davis here does a tour
in Syria, he comes back

29:18.400 --> 29:19.700
with a souvenir Koran
worth millions.

29:19.900 --> 29:21.140
He probably thought,
after four years,

29:21.340 --> 29:22.740
he was safe to unload it.
But he doesn't realize

29:22.940 --> 29:24.280
four years isn't
near long enough

29:24.480 --> 29:25.910
that the Syrians
would forget.

29:26.110 --> 29:27.510
They've probably been monitoring
every black-market auction site,

29:27.710 --> 29:29.050
waiting for it to show up.

29:29.250 --> 29:31.020
So if they're still hunting,
then Calvin got rid of it

29:31.220 --> 29:33.080
before they got him.
Somehow, it ended up in L.A.

29:33.280 --> 29:34.450
Wait. Hold up a sec.

29:34.650 --> 29:36.050
Got Calvin's social media here.

29:36.250 --> 29:39.060
Guess who he celebrated
an anniversary with last year?

29:39.260 --> 29:41.090
Juliet Amato.

29:41.290 --> 29:42.790
She swore to me and Tan
she'd never seen the Koran.

29:42.990 --> 29:44.500
But she did say
she went through

29:44.700 --> 29:46.700
a breakup before moving here.
This guy Calvin

29:46.900 --> 29:48.300
must've been her ex.

29:48.500 --> 29:49.630
So Juliet steals
the book from him,

29:49.830 --> 29:51.000
then pulls the jewels
off the cover,

29:51.200 --> 29:52.500
thinking that she can
impress her boss,

29:52.700 --> 29:53.970
and no one will be the wiser.
She probably

29:54.170 --> 29:56.410
doesn't realize
how valuable the book is,

29:56.610 --> 29:57.470
but we just told her.

29:57.670 --> 29:58.710
Where the hell is she?

29:58.910 --> 30:00.140
She got a ride-share
30 minutes ago, said

30:00.340 --> 30:02.180
she was going home to rest,
but if she knows she can

30:02.380 --> 30:04.150
make money off the Koran,
she-she's probably on her way

30:04.350 --> 30:06.120
to sell it right now.
That's a bet
I'm willing to take.

30:06.320 --> 30:09.040
Let's get the route of that car.
We need to track her down now.

30:17.240 --> 30:18.810
(door closes)

30:24.390 --> 30:27.370
Welcome to Haddaway's.
Can I help you find something?

30:27.570 --> 30:28.840
Actually, I found this book

30:29.040 --> 30:30.470
cleaning out my mom's
attic and was wondering

30:30.670 --> 30:31.810
if it's worth anything.

30:32.010 --> 30:33.340
You guys buy books, right?

30:33.540 --> 30:35.300
We sure do.
Let's take a peek.

30:38.370 --> 30:39.850
Oh, my goodness.

30:40.050 --> 30:41.390
This is interesting.

30:41.590 --> 30:44.220
I don't think I've ever seen
anything quite like it.

30:44.420 --> 30:46.460
Do-do you happen to know
where your mother got this?

30:46.660 --> 30:48.030
Uh... no.

30:48.230 --> 30:50.290
She goes to a lot of thrift
stores and garage sales.

30:50.490 --> 30:53.030
Is it valuable?
Based on its antiquity,
I should think so.

30:53.230 --> 30:55.030
But I'd have to do some research

30:55.230 --> 30:56.630
before I could
give you a number.

30:56.830 --> 30:58.200
Would you be willing
to leave this with me?

30:58.400 --> 31:00.240
I was really hoping
to sell it quickly.

31:00.440 --> 31:02.110
For my mom.
She could use the cash.

31:02.310 --> 31:05.580
I'd even take a rough estimate.
Oh, I wouldn't recommend that.

31:05.780 --> 31:07.110
No, no. Something this special,

31:07.310 --> 31:09.910
you're gonna want
to get proper authentication.

31:10.110 --> 31:12.220
Is it okay
if I take a closer look?

31:12.420 --> 31:14.340
Yeah.

31:16.400 --> 31:19.240
I'm sort of in a rush, so
if you could be quick about it.

31:21.310 --> 31:22.960
I keep trying
Juliet's cell,

31:23.160 --> 31:24.500
but it's going
straight to voice mail.

31:24.700 --> 31:26.300
She's a little busy right now.

31:26.500 --> 31:28.470
Her ride-share just dropped her
at Haddaway's Bookshop

31:28.670 --> 31:30.770
in North Hollywood, after
stopping at her apartment,

31:30.970 --> 31:32.100
probably to pick up the Koran.

31:32.300 --> 31:33.800
Haddaway's has
a rare book section.

31:34.010 --> 31:35.340
It looks like
she's trying to sell the Koran

31:35.540 --> 31:36.710
before they track her down.

31:36.910 --> 31:38.040
BOLO just came back
on the suspects' car

31:38.240 --> 31:39.580
from the valet
security footage.

31:39.780 --> 31:41.350
The vehicle was spotted
on a traffic camera

31:41.550 --> 31:42.710
just off Vineland.

31:42.910 --> 31:44.080
That's only a few miles
from the bookstore.

31:44.280 --> 31:45.680
They got to be onto her.
Let's just hope

31:45.880 --> 31:46.850
they haven't found her yet.
All right, tac up.

31:47.050 --> 31:50.000
20-Squad's rolling out now.

31:59.510 --> 32:01.800
And there you go.

32:02.000 --> 32:04.720
How can I help you?

32:17.800 --> 32:18.650
(people screaming)

32:18.850 --> 32:21.250
Help! They're after me!

32:21.450 --> 32:22.770
Come on! Move!

32:23.740 --> 32:26.370
(siren whoops, tires squeak)

32:34.120 --> 32:36.800
There's two men.
They have guns.
HONDO: LAPD. Get outside

32:37.000 --> 32:38.900
where you're safe.
Street, Tan, let's move it.

32:39.100 --> 32:40.440
It's okay. Shh.
Go, go, go.

32:40.640 --> 32:41.820
Let's go.
Go, go, go.

32:43.260 --> 32:46.440
He ran that way.
Get out of here. Go!
Get out of here.

32:46.640 --> 32:48.350
20-David to Command.

32:48.550 --> 32:50.550
I got eyes on one suspect,
deep northwest side

32:50.750 --> 32:52.450
of the store.
Deacon, Powell search

32:52.650 --> 32:54.470
the front for the other gunman.
Roger.

33:03.180 --> 33:05.060
Kid, come to me.
What the hell is going on?

33:05.260 --> 33:07.050
Get down! Cover!
(yells)

33:07.450 --> 33:09.570
We lost sight of the suspect.
We're in pursuit.

33:09.770 --> 33:11.570
Going right.

33:11.770 --> 33:14.160
(distant clatter)

33:21.600 --> 33:23.350
Hey, it's okay.

33:23.550 --> 33:25.920
We're here to help.
I was en route to the stock room

33:26.120 --> 33:27.580
when I heard gunfire.
Listen to me.

33:27.780 --> 33:30.190
You're gonna head that way.
Stay low, stay very quiet.

33:30.390 --> 33:32.690
There's officers outside.
You'll be safe.
Go.

33:32.890 --> 33:35.310
Go. Go.
Okay.

33:43.780 --> 33:45.420
Hold it.

33:46.790 --> 33:48.440
Cover!
(clicking)

33:48.640 --> 33:49.810
HONDO:
Move in!

33:50.010 --> 33:52.460
STREET: Hondo,
next aisle on your left.

34:08.440 --> 34:09.930
LAPD!

34:10.130 --> 34:12.000
Drop the weapon,
hands over your head.

34:12.200 --> 34:14.250
Get down!
STREET:
On your stomach.

34:18.490 --> 34:21.590
25-David.
One suspect in custody.

34:33.200 --> 34:35.590
(yells)
Give me the Koran,

34:35.790 --> 34:37.540
and I might not kill you.

34:43.810 --> 34:45.230
(Juliet yells)
Tan, you're Code 4?

34:45.430 --> 34:46.680
Yeah, go.
Street, move.

34:48.280 --> 34:51.340
(Juliet crying, yelling)

34:51.540 --> 34:53.140
No.
LAPD! Let her go.

34:53.340 --> 34:54.710
(gunshots)

34:54.910 --> 34:57.410
20-David. Got eyes
on the remaining suspect.

34:57.610 --> 34:59.010
Drop that weapon!
(grunts)

34:59.210 --> 35:02.560
Deacon. Saleh's got
the Koran, headed your way.

35:10.900 --> 35:13.510
(grunts)

35:19.280 --> 35:21.570
20-David to Command.

35:21.770 --> 35:23.170
We're Code 4.

35:23.370 --> 35:25.440
(panting)

35:25.640 --> 35:26.900
STREET:
If you'd told us

35:27.100 --> 35:28.310
about the Koran, we could
have helped protect you.

35:28.510 --> 35:29.570
I swear
I didn't know what it was

35:29.770 --> 35:30.970
when I first took it from my ex.

35:31.170 --> 35:32.510
Just thought
he'd be mad it went missing.

35:32.710 --> 35:33.840
I didn't think
this would happen.

35:34.040 --> 35:35.380
Your ex is dead,
your boss is dead.

35:35.580 --> 35:37.800
Your choices matter.
Remember that.

35:43.100 --> 35:45.540
Let's go. Move.

35:46.310 --> 35:47.590
It's ironic, huh?

35:47.790 --> 35:49.130
How do you mean?

35:49.330 --> 35:51.760
Well, in the end, these guys got
exactly what they wanted.

35:51.960 --> 35:54.130
We'll deliver this
to Dr. Rahimi.

35:54.330 --> 35:56.670
She'll see it restored
and returned back home.

35:56.870 --> 35:58.000
That's where it belongs.

35:58.200 --> 35:59.970
That's the one thing
they got right.

36:00.170 --> 36:03.510
We can understand a suspect's
motives, but we can still hate

36:03.710 --> 36:05.840
the evil things they're willing
to do because of it.

36:06.040 --> 36:08.150
All we can do
is fight to help people,

36:08.350 --> 36:10.530
keep 'em safe.

36:17.200 --> 36:18.520
Hey, yo.

36:18.720 --> 36:20.320
Hey, I've been
looking for you.
Hey.

36:20.520 --> 36:21.930
You headed somewhere?
Yeah.

36:22.130 --> 36:24.030
Yeah, I'm gonna hit the
skate park down in Long Beach.

36:24.230 --> 36:26.930
See if I can still land some
of the tricks Cooper taught me.

36:27.130 --> 36:29.400
Yeah?
Maybe find a kid I can
give his board to.

36:29.600 --> 36:31.700
Nice.
Yeah.

36:31.900 --> 36:33.900
You know, it's...

36:34.100 --> 36:36.370
it's not much of a memorial,
but it's something.

36:36.570 --> 36:39.210
You didn't manage to get ahold
of anyone from the skate group?

36:39.410 --> 36:40.840
No.

36:41.040 --> 36:43.600
Well, guess that makes me
a better detective than you.

36:44.400 --> 36:46.450
You said Cooper had been
arrested a couple times,

36:46.650 --> 36:48.080
so I checked the court docs.

36:48.290 --> 36:49.990
Turns out, both times, his bail
was posted by an ex-girlfriend.

36:50.190 --> 36:52.960
And his lawyer, um,
was an old buddy of his

36:53.160 --> 36:55.730
that he met on the skate
circuit, handled it pro bono.

36:55.930 --> 36:57.260
When I told them both
what happened,

36:57.460 --> 36:58.700
they were pretty upset.

36:58.900 --> 37:01.300
Offered to take care of
all the arrangements.

37:01.500 --> 37:03.680
For real?
Yeah.

37:04.520 --> 37:06.070
Dude, that's awesome.
Thank you.

37:06.270 --> 37:08.640
You've been there for me
through everything, lately.

37:08.840 --> 37:10.240
Bonnie, the suspension.

37:10.440 --> 37:12.310
I wanted to be there
for my SWAT brother,

37:12.510 --> 37:13.680
'cause that's what we are.

37:13.880 --> 37:16.780
We're brothers.
We're real family, Street.

37:16.980 --> 37:19.580
What you said earlier...
about ending up like Cooper.

37:19.780 --> 37:21.850
You don't have to worry,
all right?

37:22.050 --> 37:22.850
'Cause if
you ever found yourself

37:23.050 --> 37:24.390
in a dark hole like that,

37:24.590 --> 37:27.020
somebody on this team
would throw you a lifeline,

37:27.220 --> 37:28.260
and you'd take it.

37:28.460 --> 37:29.630
And if you didn't,

37:29.830 --> 37:31.760
one of us would drop down
and tie it around

37:31.960 --> 37:33.700
your damn waist, and the rest
of us would haul your ass out.

37:33.900 --> 37:35.900
Trust that.
Yeah.

37:36.100 --> 37:38.030
Thanks, man. That means a lot.

37:38.230 --> 37:40.600
Yeah. Cool if I roll with you
to the skate park?

37:40.800 --> 37:43.610
Sure, yeah, if you want to.
Yeah. You kidding?

37:43.810 --> 37:45.410
Get to see some of these,
uh, skate tricks, too.

37:45.610 --> 37:48.080
Yeah.
Yeah. That is,
if you still got the moves.

37:48.280 --> 37:49.650
Oh, I got 'em.

37:49.850 --> 37:51.080
I got 'em.
All right.

37:51.280 --> 37:53.270
(laughs)

37:54.400 --> 37:55.590
HICKS:
Good.

37:55.790 --> 37:58.260
All right,
thanks for the update.

37:58.460 --> 38:01.090
Got your call. Any news?

38:01.290 --> 38:02.960
Found your roofer.

38:03.160 --> 38:05.500
Bad news is,
there isn't much legal recourse

38:05.700 --> 38:06.830
for someone like this.

38:07.030 --> 38:08.670
Without a contract, it's easy

38:08.870 --> 38:10.870
for him to claim
that the money was a gift.

38:11.070 --> 38:15.090
But the good news is,
we had a little chat.

38:16.590 --> 38:19.080
And there's this.

38:19.280 --> 38:21.580
Oh.

38:21.780 --> 38:24.180
You got my money back.
Mm.

38:24.380 --> 38:26.380
Thank you.
I just feel so stupid, Bob.

38:26.580 --> 38:29.650
Uh...
I'm sorry you had to deal
with this, with me.

38:29.850 --> 38:31.520
Maggie, don't do that.

38:31.720 --> 38:33.190
This could have happened
to anybody.

38:33.390 --> 38:35.530
You're a good, kind person
and I'm here for you,

38:35.730 --> 38:37.190
anything you need.

38:37.390 --> 38:39.400
Thank you. (laughs)

38:39.600 --> 38:42.000
I guess I'm really bad
at this dating thing, huh?
(scoffs)

38:42.200 --> 38:44.740
Dating's awful.
I mean, it's so awkward.

38:44.940 --> 38:46.740
So much small talk.
Right?

38:46.940 --> 38:49.410
I-I never thought
I'd be doing that part again.

38:49.610 --> 38:50.770
You know, Martin and I talked

38:50.970 --> 38:52.240
about sailing the world together
when he retired,

38:52.440 --> 38:54.480
even though neither one
of us really know how.

38:54.680 --> 38:55.950
(both chuckle)

38:56.150 --> 38:59.580
I guess I miss feeling that safe
with someone.

38:59.780 --> 39:01.690
Yeah, I know the feeling.

39:01.890 --> 39:03.590
And, um, you know,

39:03.790 --> 39:05.460
for what it's worth,

39:05.660 --> 39:06.990
you always have me.
Yeah.

39:07.190 --> 39:10.130
I know. You are a great friend.

39:10.330 --> 39:12.600
Uh, well, um...

39:12.800 --> 39:14.100
(clears throat) Actually,

39:14.300 --> 39:15.500
Maggie, if, um...

39:15.700 --> 39:18.250
if you're open to it, I'd like
to take you to dinner...

39:19.090 --> 39:21.250
...as more than friends.

39:22.060 --> 39:25.340
I have to say, I'm-I'm...
I'm surprised...
Mm.

39:25.540 --> 39:26.980
I...

39:27.180 --> 39:28.380
I didn't think
you saw me that way.

39:28.580 --> 39:31.850
Uh, you-you know,
if you're uncomfortable...

39:32.050 --> 39:34.150
Yes, I'd love to.

39:34.350 --> 39:35.520
(both laugh)

39:35.720 --> 39:36.950
An actual date, except

39:37.150 --> 39:38.820
without all the awful
getting-to-know-you bits.

39:39.020 --> 39:40.320
Exactly. All right,
well, perfect.

39:40.520 --> 39:42.390
I just have to say up front...

39:42.590 --> 39:45.000
no sailing. I never was one
for the open water.

39:45.200 --> 39:47.200
Oh, I remember
the Catalina trip.

39:47.400 --> 39:48.530
Oh, geez.

39:48.730 --> 39:51.020
It-it... it's seared
into my memory.

39:52.450 --> 39:54.300
Walk me to my car?

39:54.510 --> 39:56.170
Yeah, I'd love to.

39:56.370 --> 39:58.120
Mm.

40:00.090 --> 40:02.330
(door opens, keys jingle)

40:03.430 --> 40:05.280
Momma. You're here?

40:05.480 --> 40:07.680
Yes, I... I came back.

40:07.880 --> 40:09.890
Hondo, your mom and I talked,

40:10.090 --> 40:11.760
and I think
you should hear her out.

40:11.960 --> 40:15.340
Okay, Mom, listen.
Me first, Hondo, please. Please.

40:16.840 --> 40:20.000
I owe you both an apology.

40:20.200 --> 40:21.730
I heard
what you said,

40:21.930 --> 40:25.450
and though I know I taught you
better than to use that tone...

40:26.550 --> 40:28.410
...there was some truth in it.
I've been thinking

40:28.610 --> 40:31.170
all day about what I said, and
you did not deserve any of that.

40:31.370 --> 40:33.140
No, I didn't.

40:33.340 --> 40:35.510
But I'm so sorry
that I scared you.

40:35.710 --> 40:38.750
I remember how worried
I was as a new mom,

40:38.950 --> 40:43.090
holding that tiny human
in my arms who I loved so much,

40:43.290 --> 40:46.660
it hurt. I was
completely overwhelmed.

40:46.860 --> 40:49.530
Momma, I really am sorry
about how I acted.

40:49.730 --> 40:52.430
It's just...
this love-- it-it...

40:52.630 --> 40:55.800
It's intense, and I just
want to be a good father.

40:56.000 --> 40:57.470
I don't want to mess that up.

40:57.670 --> 40:59.000
I would do anything for her.

40:59.200 --> 41:01.710
You know, we both want
to be the best for her.

41:01.910 --> 41:02.840
But we're gonna make mistakes,

41:03.040 --> 41:04.310
as hard as it might be

41:04.510 --> 41:05.940
for us to accept.

41:06.140 --> 41:09.680
And we are lucky that Charice is
here to help show us the ropes.

41:09.880 --> 41:11.720
Yes, we are.
Mm.

41:11.920 --> 41:13.250
Mom, I know that.

41:13.450 --> 41:15.450
I am so happy that she gets
to grow up with you, too.

41:15.650 --> 41:17.290
Thank you
for being here.

41:17.490 --> 41:18.820
I love you, baby.
(Nichelle laughs)

41:19.020 --> 41:21.070
I love you, too.
Mm.

41:23.640 --> 41:27.230
Do you know, Charice figured out
how to calm Vivienne down?

41:27.430 --> 41:29.970
Well, I just tried a swaddle,

41:30.170 --> 41:31.670
something I used
on you as a baby.

41:31.870 --> 41:35.110
Like Daddy, like daughter.

41:35.310 --> 41:36.870
Nah, nah, nah,
that's Grandma's special touch.

41:37.070 --> 41:38.340
(laughter, alarm beeping)

41:38.540 --> 41:40.440
Oh, casserole is ready.
(Vivienne cries)

41:40.640 --> 41:43.500
Now you all go get started,
and I will get her.

41:45.630 --> 41:47.450
Okay.
Thank you.

41:47.650 --> 41:48.950
(Vivienne fussing)

41:49.150 --> 41:52.060
Yes, you're my baby.

41:52.260 --> 41:54.660
Hello, little baby.

41:54.860 --> 41:56.430
(Charice murmurs quietly
to Vivienne)
