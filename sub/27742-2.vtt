00:02.108 --> 00:03.765
Some would say when it
comes to the potato,

00:03.799 --> 00:06.768
beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

00:07.399 --> 00:08.837
Oh, that's good.

00:08.871 --> 00:10.605
- I'm gonna write that down.
- Hey, man! Hey, hey,

00:10.640 --> 00:13.008
hey, hey, hey! Check this out.
What the hell do you think

00:13.042 --> 00:15.310
- that's supposed to be?
- I don't know. Read the description.

00:15.344 --> 00:17.712
I did. It just says "rare ancient bird".

00:18.475 --> 00:20.815
Have you seen this over here?
Look at this!

00:22.214 --> 00:24.019
- (panting)
- Mark, can you

00:24.053 --> 00:26.021
please stop talking?
I'm trying to write down ideas

00:26.055 --> 00:28.690
- for this article that I'm pitching.
- Oh no, man! Don't do that.

00:28.724 --> 00:30.692
No, that's so boring. Let's go have fun!

00:30.726 --> 00:32.694
It's not boring!
It's about the cultural significance

00:32.728 --> 00:35.063
- of the PEI potato.
- That's not boring?

00:35.097 --> 00:38.500
Which title do you like better?
<i>You Say Potato, I Say Identity?</i>

00:38.534 --> 00:40.201
- Oh...
- Or... or...

00:40.236 --> 00:42.704
<i>One Potato, Two Potatoes,
Three Potatoes... Us?</i>

00:42.738 --> 00:44.906
Neither of those.

00:44.940 --> 00:47.308
Those are both terrible,
terrible titles!

00:47.343 --> 00:49.544
- Bad titles!
- OK... uh...

00:49.578 --> 00:53.181
- Bryn, which one do you like?
- My middle name is potato.

00:54.116 --> 00:56.184
- What?
- What? What did you say?

00:57.077 --> 00:58.720
My middle name is potato.

00:58.754 --> 01:01.423
- No, it's not.
- It's definitely not potato.

01:02.122 --> 01:04.191
Gotcha.

01:04.226 --> 01:06.361
- No, you didn't.
- You... You didn't get us.

01:06.395 --> 01:08.363
- We said it's not.
- My middle name is actually...

01:08.397 --> 01:11.199
- Big Tony.
- Is this the first time

01:11.233 --> 01:14.035
- you've ever tried a prank?
- Gotcha.

01:14.070 --> 01:17.672
- You didn't get us, Bryn!
- That's what I thought she...

01:17.707 --> 01:19.541
- Yeah. We're not gotten.
- You gotta work on pranks.

01:19.575 --> 01:22.544
- OK.
- OK. Come on, let's go have fun, man!

01:22.578 --> 01:24.579
- It's such a nice day!
- Mark, I can't go.

01:24.613 --> 01:27.982
- I have to work. Alright? Some of us have to earn a living.
- I earn a living, Andy.

01:28.017 --> 01:30.051
- How do you earn a living?
- I pick up odd jobs here and there.

01:30.086 --> 01:32.220
For instance, I recently drew a cover

01:32.254 --> 01:34.222
for my buddy Dave's young
adult fantasy novel.

01:34.256 --> 01:36.224
You know, like,
that genre, like <i>Twilight,</i>

01:36.258 --> 01:38.226
how it's about teen
werewolves and teen vampires

01:38.260 --> 01:41.196
kinda rubbing and porking, and f...
and sucking on each other?

01:41.230 --> 01:43.031
I don't think that's what it's about.

01:43.065 --> 01:44.966
That's what it's about.
Bryn, is that what it's about?

01:45.000 --> 01:46.968
- That's what it's about.
- That's what it's about.

01:47.002 --> 01:48.870
So, anyway, Dave's novel is like that,
except it's

01:48.904 --> 01:50.772
about teen swamp things.
It's called <i>Swamp Academy.</i>

01:50.806 --> 01:52.674
- Hmm. Yeah.
- And there's the cover I drew.

01:53.338 --> 01:55.577
- Oh, my God, Mark... that is actual porn!
- I know!

01:55.611 --> 01:57.212
I kept waiting for them to
give me notes but they just

01:57.246 --> 01:59.214
- signed off on the whole thing!
- Don't zoom in. Don't...

01:59.248 --> 02:00.982
- Don't zoom! Oh, my God...
- Look at that guy in the back.

02:01.016 --> 02:02.984
- That's... that's the neighbour.
- There's so many fluids! Wow!

02:03.018 --> 02:04.986
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
Hey, yeah, Bryn, you wanna see that?

02:05.020 --> 02:06.855
Oh, actually, I'm gonna...

02:06.889 --> 02:10.592
Alright. That's her phone now.
That's OK. That's her phone.

02:10.626 --> 02:13.561
(musical theme)

02:16.219 --> 02:18.199
I-I just don't understand why everything

02:18.234 --> 02:20.201
works out for you and
nothing works out for me.

02:20.236 --> 02:22.203
You want to know why that is?
It's because I open myself up

02:22.238 --> 02:25.206
to the universe and I say "yes".
We are taught to say "no".

02:25.241 --> 02:28.209
I'm serious. Don't do drugs.
Don't talk to strangers.

02:28.244 --> 02:30.879
Stranger Danger.
You know what I call Stranger Danger?

02:30.913 --> 02:33.882
- Stranger Opportunity.
- Those Stranger Danger videos

02:33.916 --> 02:35.284
are meant to keep kids
from getting kidnapped.

02:35.338 --> 02:37.306
Yeah, well,
I say let yourself be kidnapped!

02:37.340 --> 02:39.812
See the world! Hey!
Here's something we can do.

02:39.847 --> 02:41.310
You wanna go swim with the lobsters?

02:41.344 --> 02:43.312
I don't think that's
what lobster tours means.

02:43.346 --> 02:45.314
But who knows what it means?
That's a mystery.

02:45.348 --> 02:47.316
Mark, no.
I just want to go to the hospital,

02:47.350 --> 02:49.318
give Dad his clothes
and finish my article.

02:49.352 --> 02:51.320
Ouh! I've got a great idea.
I'm writing it

02:51.354 --> 02:53.322
from the perspective of the potato.
So it's...

02:53.356 --> 02:55.257
- No. No!
- You... you said to say yes!

02:55.291 --> 02:58.594
Not to your own crappy ideas, Andy.
To the universe!

02:58.628 --> 03:00.596
- (Andy sighs)
- To swimming with the lobsters

03:00.630 --> 03:03.131
or zip-lining or...
Two Anne of Green Gables

03:03.166 --> 03:05.567
- walking right at us.
- Oh, my God.

03:06.295 --> 03:07.970
Is this...
Can we escape from this or are we kinda

03:08.004 --> 03:09.571
- locked in?
- Yeah, we're locked in.

03:11.110 --> 03:12.949
- Hello, gentlemen.
- Hi.

03:12.984 --> 03:15.476
- You're new here.
- I'm sorry?

03:15.501 --> 03:17.335
I'm Beverley Clinch,
the artistic director

03:17.369 --> 03:19.637
of the Cavendish Theatre Company.

03:19.672 --> 03:22.373
And these... these are my Annes.

03:22.408 --> 03:24.309
Your Annes, yes. Your Annes.

03:24.343 --> 03:26.074
Well... Two of them, at least.

03:26.179 --> 03:30.632
This titan of the stage
played Anne from 1965 to 1980.

03:30.667 --> 03:33.952
And... Linda over here
is our current Anne.

03:33.986 --> 03:36.154
You direct the local <i>Anne
Of Green Gables</i> play?

03:36.188 --> 03:38.823
Indeed. My Annes and I
have been watching you

03:38.857 --> 03:41.693
ever since you arrived in town.
In fact...

03:41.727 --> 03:44.829
many of us are watching you still.

03:44.863 --> 03:48.232
(eerie music)

03:51.698 --> 03:53.180
- Oh, my goodness!
- Woah, woah, woah!

03:53.206 --> 03:56.507
Oh! Yeah. Alright.

03:56.542 --> 03:58.910
Simply put, Cavendish is the home

03:58.944 --> 04:01.146
of Anne Of Green Gables and it is...

04:01.180 --> 04:04.916
my job every year to put
on a theatrical experience

04:04.950 --> 04:08.787
that honors that heritage.
And I am currently casting

04:08.821 --> 04:11.289
peripheral roles for the play.

04:11.323 --> 04:13.491
You, sir...

04:13.526 --> 04:16.661
are Gilbert Blythe.

04:16.695 --> 04:18.797
Me?

04:18.831 --> 04:21.332
Gilbert... Blythe?

04:21.367 --> 04:24.402
Anne's love interest!
You've got that handsome face,

04:24.436 --> 04:27.605
that lean build,
that popularity with women

04:27.640 --> 04:29.707
that... I mean, I assume you have.

04:29.742 --> 04:31.910
- More or less, yeah!
- Yes.

04:31.944 --> 04:35.113
And you... You are...

04:36.146 --> 04:38.049
Creepy Ted.

04:40.187 --> 04:41.052
I'm sorry, Creepy Ted?

04:41.086 --> 04:43.121
He's a lesser-known
character in the books,

04:43.155 --> 04:46.457
a terrible old man whose
only job is to make sure

04:46.492 --> 04:48.976
that horses are excited,
you know, before breeding.

04:49.011 --> 04:50.495
He's a total creep,

04:50.529 --> 04:52.831
but he does have the
opportunity to change

04:52.865 --> 04:55.400
at the end of the play.
He, of course, you know,

04:55.434 --> 04:57.402
rejects that opportunity,
somehow becoming more creepy

04:57.436 --> 05:00.071
than he was to begin with
and ultimately dying

05:00.105 --> 05:04.042
at the noble hands of Gilbert Blythe
while an aroused Clydesdale looks on.

05:04.076 --> 05:06.744
We will take it. We're in! Say no more.

05:06.779 --> 05:08.880
- No! What? No, no, no!
- Sounds like a wonderful play.

05:08.914 --> 05:10.882
- I can't wait for the climax.
- Hold on. Yeah, hold on.

05:10.916 --> 05:12.884
Yeah, hold on. We're not...
We're not going to take it.

05:12.918 --> 05:15.081
Um, for one thing,
I have a writer's deadline.

05:15.116 --> 05:16.588
- Self-imposed, but still...
- Self-imposed.

05:16.622 --> 05:19.757
Yeah. And secondly,
you haven't seen us act.

05:19.792 --> 05:22.260
Ha! Ha! Acting, um...

05:22.294 --> 05:25.396
- Acting comes from in here.
- Oh, wow. That's...

05:25.431 --> 05:28.099
I... Yeah, I feel it. I feel it.
Oh, yeah, you were...

05:28.133 --> 05:30.335
- That really hurt.
- Well, I've seen

05:30.369 --> 05:32.470
all I need to see from you two.

05:32.504 --> 05:34.973
The smug,
handsome affability of a young Gilbert

05:35.007 --> 05:38.309
and the... creepiness of Creepy Ted.

05:39.938 --> 05:42.947
Think on my offer, gentlemen.
Rehearsals...

05:42.982 --> 05:45.183
begin tomorrow. OK.

05:45.217 --> 05:47.852
Annes... (clicks tongue)

05:55.680 --> 05:56.394
(Andy): No!

05:56.428 --> 05:59.097
- No.
- Why not, man? This is exactly

05:59.131 --> 06:00.965
what I meant about saying
"yes" to the universe!

06:01.000 --> 06:03.701
Yeah, it's easy to say "yes" to the
universe when it gives you a juicy role

06:03.736 --> 06:05.937
like Gilbert Blythe.
Which is insane, by the way!

06:05.971 --> 06:07.939
- You are nothing like Gilbert.
- How could you say that to me?

06:07.973 --> 06:10.775
You don't even know what I'm talking
about! You haven't read the books!

06:10.809 --> 06:12.710
I don't need to read the books.
Gilbert never read books.

06:12.745 --> 06:14.712
You don't know that.
You didn't read the books!

06:14.747 --> 06:16.547
That's a good point.
Hey, do you think dad wanted

06:16.582 --> 06:18.549
- clean underwear as well?
- I don't know.

06:18.584 --> 06:21.719
- Rollie? Wake up!
- OK. I'm gonna hit him with the paddles.

06:21.754 --> 06:24.088
- Give me some space here!
- Oh! Oh no...

06:24.123 --> 06:26.157
- Alright. Clear!
- (repeating): What's going on?

06:26.191 --> 06:28.944
- Oh, my goodness! Dad!
- OK. Your father had another cardiac event...

06:29.029 --> 06:32.030
Come on, Rollie! Oh, my gosh! Rollie!

06:32.064 --> 06:34.799
- Is he OK?
- (droning beep)

06:34.833 --> 06:36.968
Um... I'm sorry, everybody...

06:37.002 --> 06:40.138
- He's gone.
- (Ruth): No!

06:40.172 --> 06:42.473
- What?
- (Ruth crying)

06:42.508 --> 06:44.475
- He was fine this morning!
- (beep stops)

06:44.510 --> 06:48.880
Yes, well, medical situations
can change very quickly.

06:48.914 --> 06:52.050
(laughing)

06:52.084 --> 06:54.652
My God! That was a prank?

06:54.687 --> 06:58.489
- What?
- That was incredible!

06:58.524 --> 07:00.992
- What?!
- Oh, God! Oh, wow!

07:01.026 --> 07:03.161
Your faces! Your faces!

07:03.195 --> 07:05.596
Bryn should take notes
on how to do pranks

07:05.631 --> 07:07.699
from you guys. That was top notch!

07:07.733 --> 07:09.255
How was my acting? I really thought

07:09.302 --> 07:12.103
I was gonna give it away, but I...
That was so much fun!

07:12.137 --> 07:14.372
- That was incredible.
- You were a triumph, Ruth.

07:14.406 --> 07:16.607
Oh, my goodness.
We could talk about your acting all day,

07:16.642 --> 07:19.043
but actually, somebody
actually really need this, so...

07:19.078 --> 07:21.479
- Oh boy... See you, Dr Green!
- (laughing): Cheers, doc!

07:21.513 --> 07:24.449
- You know, this hospital is refreshingly chill.
- Yeah!

07:24.483 --> 07:26.517
So, how are you two boys settling in?

07:26.552 --> 07:28.786
Oh, great!
Andy and I just got offered roles

07:28.821 --> 07:30.788
in the upcoming <i>Anne
of Green Gables</i> play.

07:30.823 --> 07:33.284
- Oh!
- That's wonderful!

07:33.319 --> 07:34.926
Let me guess...

07:34.960 --> 07:37.462
- Gilbert?
- Yes! That's right.

07:37.496 --> 07:40.231
Of course! Well, with your handsome face

07:40.265 --> 07:42.934
and your lean build and your
popularity with the women,

07:42.968 --> 07:45.636
- which I assume you have.
- More or less!

07:45.671 --> 07:48.973
And you... are... Creepy Ted!

07:49.008 --> 07:51.042
How on Earth did you know that?

07:51.076 --> 07:54.512
Oh, that's great! That's a terrific
role. Who's playing the horse?

07:54.546 --> 07:56.147
I don't know and I'm not doing it.

07:56.181 --> 07:58.416
- Why not?
- Because I don't want

07:58.450 --> 08:00.418
to be a creep in the
background while this guy does

08:00.452 --> 08:02.420
a character he knows nothing about!

08:02.454 --> 08:04.989
(British accent): Look out, Anne!
Here come the gables!

08:05.024 --> 08:07.392
- Wonderful!
- That's quite a good accent.

08:07.426 --> 08:10.595
- Gilbert isn't British.
- What does that have to do

08:10.629 --> 08:13.931
with anything?
You are going to be in a play

08:13.966 --> 08:17.568
without even auditioning for it.
That's fate!

08:17.603 --> 08:20.238
That's the...
that's the universe giving you a gift.

08:20.272 --> 08:21.621
That is exactly what I said, Ruth.

08:21.674 --> 08:24.409
Yeah. The universe doesn't give gifts.
OK? So...

08:24.443 --> 08:26.611
Woah! The universe doesn't give gifts?

08:26.645 --> 08:30.248
Andy, it is the universe! Hello?

08:30.282 --> 08:32.616
- Hello!
- You know, if nothing else,

08:32.650 --> 08:34.751
the experience might
make a neat article.

08:34.787 --> 08:37.621
That is a good point.
Andy, that's a good point.

08:38.979 --> 08:40.457
Yeah, it is a good point.

08:40.491 --> 08:42.626
- That's the spirit!
- He's coming around!

08:42.660 --> 08:44.662
- Alright!
- Great to hear! And you know,

08:44.696 --> 08:46.964
after my little performance,
I sort of think

08:46.999 --> 08:49.967
that I could be an actor!
Could you see me in movies?

08:50.002 --> 08:52.336
- Uh...
- Oh, uh...

08:52.371 --> 08:54.972
"You're out of order!
You're out of order!

08:55.007 --> 08:57.308
This whole courtroom's out of order!"

08:57.342 --> 08:58.573
- Yeah!
- Not bad.

08:58.574 --> 09:00.580
She's a natural. A natural.

09:00.612 --> 09:04.715
Um... "I'm Bond. James Bond.
Nice to meet ya."

09:05.708 --> 09:07.118
- That's nice.
- That's pretty good.

09:07.152 --> 09:09.320
"Did you f... my wife?

09:09.354 --> 09:11.989
Did you f... my wife?
Tell me if you did!"

09:12.024 --> 09:14.625
- <i>Raging Bull.</i> I like it.
- Yeah! "I'm gonna beat the s... out of you!"

09:14.660 --> 09:16.489
- That's enough, Ruth.
- OK. Yeah.

09:16.496 --> 09:19.397
Oh, if that's enough... OK, Rollie.

09:23.135 --> 09:25.303
- Where the hell are we?
- I know, right?

09:25.337 --> 09:27.438
Yeah, I think this is
gonna be a lot of fun, man.

09:27.473 --> 09:30.374
- We're gonna have a good time.
- Yeah, well, if this gets weird at any moment,

09:30.409 --> 09:32.910
- we are out of here, alright?
- Of course, yeah. Say no more.

09:35.280 --> 09:37.281
(ominous music)

09:40.719 --> 09:43.621
Well, looks OK to me. Hi, guys!

09:43.655 --> 09:46.580
- (sighs)
- A lot of you, uh?

09:49.961 --> 09:51.836
So I hear you're our new Gilbert.

09:51.870 --> 09:53.938
- That's very exciting.
- Oh, yeah.

09:53.972 --> 09:56.841
- Are you the new Anne?
- Oh! Ha! Ha! Goodness, no.

09:56.875 --> 09:59.176
It's been almost 10 years
since I last played her.

09:59.211 --> 10:01.512
Oh. Well, you haven't aged a day.
Or maybe you have,

10:01.546 --> 10:03.347
but you looked like a
little kid back then.

10:03.382 --> 10:05.383
(giggling)

10:08.387 --> 10:10.521
- (laughing)
- You like that one, uh? Yeah.

10:10.555 --> 10:13.190
- Pretty good one. Yeah.
- So, this is the house.

10:13.225 --> 10:15.993
And you two will be rooming with Travis,

10:16.027 --> 10:19.130
who we've cast as Matthew Cuthbert.

10:19.164 --> 10:22.333
Ah yes, Matthew Cuthbert.
From the books.

10:22.367 --> 10:24.502
I'm sorry, is this an overnight thing?

10:24.536 --> 10:26.904
Because we didn't pack any bags.

10:26.938 --> 10:30.841
Don't worry. All will be provided.

10:33.712 --> 10:35.880
Sort of a haunting way to say that.

10:35.914 --> 10:38.015
- Yeah, it is.
- (giggling)

10:38.049 --> 10:40.117
(whispering): Mark...

10:42.554 --> 10:45.389
(ominous music)

10:47.392 --> 10:50.194
- No service. That's great.
- Stop worrying, man!

10:50.228 --> 10:52.129
Sure, we're in the middle of nowhere

10:52.164 --> 10:54.131
and all the ladies are dressed the same

10:54.166 --> 10:56.133
like a very on the nose
horror movie, but...

10:56.168 --> 10:58.469
those ladies are pretty nice.
Did you meet Grace?

10:58.503 --> 11:00.571
- Which one's Grace?
- She was the Anne

11:00.605 --> 11:03.741
in her 40s with the
really focused stare.

11:03.775 --> 11:06.610
I never saw her blink.
You should find out if she's single.

11:06.645 --> 11:08.612
I'm not here to pick up, Mark!
I'm here because you

11:08.647 --> 11:11.148
convinced me this is some sort
of cosmic good idea or whatever.

11:11.183 --> 11:13.784
But you could still pick up
while you're here. You know?

11:13.819 --> 11:16.921
I bet if you sleep with one Anne,
all the other Annes know. A bit.

11:16.955 --> 11:19.323
I bet that's true.
I bet they're all a bit, like...

11:19.357 --> 11:21.358
- Ouh! That was good.
- Look, Mark,

11:21.393 --> 11:23.427
you promised me we could
leave if it got weird.

11:24.040 --> 11:26.497
- It's weird.
- It's not weird!

11:26.531 --> 11:28.999
Man, it's good!
You just need to get acclimated.

11:29.034 --> 11:31.202
Trust me,
this is gonna be a really fun time.

11:31.236 --> 11:34.939
- Right, Travis?
- We're all gonna die here.

11:34.973 --> 11:36.941
- For f... 's sake! Thank you!
- Come on, Travis!

11:36.975 --> 11:38.909
- Thank you, Travis! Thank you!
- No, not "thank you"!

11:38.944 --> 11:41.679
No! Travis is an idiot.
I gave him too much credit.

11:41.713 --> 11:42.812
Travis, why do you say that?

11:42.813 --> 11:44.813
- I had a dream.
- Oh, jeez!

11:44.883 --> 11:46.517
- Let him finish!
- I had a dream

11:46.551 --> 11:49.854
where all these women were torturing me.

11:49.888 --> 11:52.957
They wanted what only I,
as a man, could give them:

11:53.982 --> 11:55.646
my seed.

11:56.795 --> 12:00.297
I begged them to stop,
but they wouldn't.

12:00.332 --> 12:02.533
And then,
they took my member in their hands...

12:02.567 --> 12:04.435
- Yeah, OK, enough. Enough!
- And then, they...

12:04.469 --> 12:06.437
- they began to take...
- No. Travis, no more. Let's...

12:06.471 --> 12:08.439
- let's clam that up, OK?
- Yeah, no, I think... I think

12:08.473 --> 12:10.484
I'm with Mark on that one.
That sounds more like a sex dream

12:10.509 --> 12:12.810
- than a premonition, Travis.
- It was a little of both.

12:12.844 --> 12:15.279
- Cool.
- OK...

12:15.313 --> 12:17.581
not that I wanna hear
anything more from you, but...

12:17.616 --> 12:20.317
If you had that dream and
you're convinced it's real,

12:20.352 --> 12:22.386
why would you still come here?

12:23.383 --> 12:26.223
I really want to be an actor.

12:27.319 --> 12:28.158
Holy hell!

12:28.193 --> 12:30.194
That's the most pathetic thing
I've ever heard in my life.

12:30.228 --> 12:32.062
Why isn't he Creepy Ted?

12:34.266 --> 12:36.333
(insects chirping)

12:36.368 --> 12:38.736
(Andy): Idea for an article.
"Isolation."

12:38.770 --> 12:42.006
"Boredom." We are currently in an old...

12:42.040 --> 12:45.175
I want to say... Georgian house.

12:45.210 --> 12:47.177
It is the middle of nowhere.

12:48.401 --> 12:51.181
My feelings so far:

12:51.216 --> 12:53.117
nervousness...

12:53.151 --> 12:56.453
and a penetrating dread...

12:57.102 --> 13:00.724
plus some hunger that was staved off
because Mark thought to bring peaches.

13:05.075 --> 13:07.298
(whispering):
My sisters and I want your seed.

13:07.332 --> 13:09.466
(moaning)

13:09.501 --> 13:11.802
(soft chuckle) Oh, my God!

13:11.836 --> 13:13.804
Oh, Andy! Look!

13:13.838 --> 13:15.940
Look what's happening to
the crotch of his pants.

13:15.974 --> 13:17.292
I know what you want me
to look at, Mark,

13:17.309 --> 13:20.411
- and I am not looking.
- (knocking)

13:21.757 --> 13:23.981
Gentlemen, it's time.

13:25.031 --> 13:26.850
Oh no!

13:29.458 --> 13:32.489
Please, gentlemen,
come join us in the circle.

13:33.274 --> 13:34.791
Anne... Hello, Anne.

13:35.695 --> 13:37.428
Hi. Hello, everyone.

13:37.462 --> 13:40.998
- Nice to see you all again.
- Here in the presence

13:41.032 --> 13:44.935
of Vivian, the oldest living Anne,

13:45.737 --> 13:48.839
and in the name of Lucy Maud Montgomery,

13:48.873 --> 13:51.008
the "Creator",

13:51.042 --> 13:53.010
from whose pen sprung a world,

13:54.037 --> 13:55.946
we move into this new year

13:56.748 --> 13:59.783
with a ritual that we do every year:

14:00.796 --> 14:04.655
the twisting of the tongues.

14:07.206 --> 14:12.162
- Unique New York.
- (all): Unique New York.

14:12.197 --> 14:14.965
P-E-I, pizza pie.

14:15.000 --> 14:17.101
(all): P-E-I, pizza pie.

14:17.135 --> 14:19.803
And Anne had a plan

14:19.838 --> 14:22.640
to flummox the man!

14:22.674 --> 14:24.975
(all): Anne had a plan

14:25.010 --> 14:27.311
to flummox the man!

14:27.345 --> 14:31.382
- Inhale, Anne!
- (all inhaling)

14:31.416 --> 14:36.320
(vocalizing): A-a-a-a-anne.

14:36.354 --> 14:40.624
(all): A-a-a-a-a-anne.

14:40.659 --> 14:45.129
Anne, be honest. Do you ever think
about leaving Green Gables?

14:45.163 --> 14:47.498
Oh, I don't know, Gilbert.

14:47.532 --> 14:49.800
I maybe had a thought
like that once. But then,

14:49.834 --> 14:51.935
I looked around at all the green,

14:52.706 --> 14:54.338
all the gables

14:55.014 --> 14:57.041
and I remembered.

14:57.075 --> 15:00.344
This is home.

15:02.964 --> 15:05.338
Andy! Andy!

15:12.991 --> 15:14.825
Why don't you two kiss so I can watch?

15:14.859 --> 15:18.462
- (gasps)
- Get out of here, Creepy Ted!

15:18.496 --> 15:20.831
Can't you see we don't want you?

15:20.865 --> 15:22.866
Why don't you make me, Gilbert?

15:23.997 --> 15:26.070
- Mayhaps I shall!
- Hey!

15:26.104 --> 15:27.738
No, no, this is good.
Use the fear, use the fear.

15:27.772 --> 15:30.107
Clearly, Gilbert is a
stronger man than you but you,

15:30.141 --> 15:33.243
you're a proud old creep, aren't you?
Aren't you, Ted?

15:33.278 --> 15:35.312
That's right, you proud old creep!

15:35.346 --> 15:37.681
- Fight me, you old bastard!
- It's not in the script.

15:37.716 --> 15:39.550
Forget the script! Use the moment!

15:39.584 --> 15:42.653
Come at me, Creepy Ted, you old bastard!
Poor, old bastard!

15:42.687 --> 15:44.822
OK! Alright! Uh... Screw you, Gilbert!

15:44.856 --> 15:46.924
Anne deserves better than you!

15:46.958 --> 15:49.893
Better than me?
Like who, Creepy Ted? Like you?

15:49.928 --> 15:52.262
- Yes! Yes, like me!
- With your receding hairline

15:52.297 --> 15:55.101
and your litany of
magazine rejection letters?

15:55.167 --> 15:58.068
- Hey!
- Oh, he doesn't like that!

15:58.103 --> 16:00.170
Creepy Ted doesn't like it!

16:00.205 --> 16:02.106
No, Creepy Ted doesn't like that!

16:02.140 --> 16:04.875
Well, come at me, Creepy Ted!
Show me what you got!

16:04.909 --> 16:08.779
- Motherf...!
- Oh, yeah! Yeah!

16:08.813 --> 16:10.948
(screaming)

16:10.982 --> 16:13.450
Get off of me! (muffled speech)

16:13.485 --> 16:15.452
Get off of me!

16:15.487 --> 16:17.287
- (angry shout)
- (gasps)

16:19.173 --> 16:20.057
How was that?

16:20.091 --> 16:22.493
That felt really good.

16:25.531 --> 16:26.563
What's this?

16:26.598 --> 16:29.466
Oh, sorry. I'm just using it
to take some notes.

16:29.501 --> 16:32.803
Notes. You are...

16:34.255 --> 16:37.141
- You're a spy?
- What? No! I'm a writer.

16:37.175 --> 16:39.243
What rival theatre company
are you writing for?

16:39.277 --> 16:43.680
The Eastern Front?
Charlottetown Players?

16:43.715 --> 16:46.083
Uh... It's just
for a magazine article or...

16:46.117 --> 16:48.018
- LIAR!
- Woah! Woah! Woah! OK!

16:48.052 --> 16:51.088
OK! OK! Ladies,
I feel like there's been some sort

16:51.122 --> 16:53.590
of a misunderstanding here.
Andy's not a spy

16:53.625 --> 16:56.260
or anything interesting like that.
He's just a very boring writer

16:56.294 --> 16:58.762
who documents the history
of potatoes, for instance.

16:58.797 --> 17:00.931
And I'm also writing a
semi-autobiographical novel.

17:00.965 --> 17:02.933
Like I said, very boring.

17:02.967 --> 17:05.102
- Holy moly!
- It's my member you want.

17:05.136 --> 17:07.137
- My member!
- OK, Travis,

17:07.172 --> 17:09.205
I feel like you're misreading
this situation, pal.

17:09.240 --> 17:11.541
- (shrieking)
- Maybe not! Maybe not! OK!

17:11.576 --> 17:13.777
I think Travis wanted that to happen!

17:13.811 --> 17:15.779
- Oh! Jesus...
- OK! Let's go! Go, go!

17:15.814 --> 17:17.948
- Go, go, go!
- Come one! Come on!

17:17.982 --> 17:20.284
- Lock the door!
- OK! OK!

17:20.318 --> 17:22.452
- (murmuring)
- (shushing)

17:22.487 --> 17:24.454
Do you think they heard us come down?

17:24.489 --> 17:26.790
- I don't think so.
- This is it. This is how I die.

17:26.825 --> 17:28.792
Yeah. Alone in a backwoods
farmhouse murdered

17:28.827 --> 17:30.994
- by a bunch of Anne Shirleys.
- Who the hell is Shirley?

17:31.029 --> 17:33.497
That's Anne's last name.
You still haven't read the book?

17:33.531 --> 17:35.499
- When would I have read the book?
- I don't know!

17:35.533 --> 17:38.153
- Browse a Wikipedia article!
- (shushing)

17:38.188 --> 17:40.604
It's gonna be fine.
They don't know where we are.

17:40.638 --> 17:43.640
Let's just wait till they go to bed
and then sneak out the back.

17:43.675 --> 17:47.316
- (banging)
- OK. They might know where we are.

17:51.418 --> 17:53.986
Uh... Give yourself
over to the universe!

17:54.020 --> 17:56.789
What happens when your life is a toilet
and the universe takes a big old dump?

17:56.823 --> 17:59.491
Oh, that's good. You should
write that one down, actually.

17:59.526 --> 18:01.627
Travis was right, Mark.
We are going to die here.

18:01.661 --> 18:03.662
No, Andy, Travis was wrong

18:03.697 --> 18:06.165
in every respect.
And I'm not dying tonight.

18:07.181 --> 18:08.968
I can promise you that.

18:09.571 --> 18:11.303
- Storm doors!
- Are there storm doors?

18:11.338 --> 18:14.273
- There are storm doors.
- Oh, thank God! I was not ready to use this. Let's go!

18:14.307 --> 18:16.775
- (grunting)
- Oh, God...

18:16.810 --> 18:18.877
- Aaaah!
- Oh! OK...

18:18.912 --> 18:20.811
- Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
- (repeating): What?

18:21.131 --> 18:23.716
The car keys are in the house!
Yes, the car keys are in the house!

18:23.750 --> 18:25.617
- I got this.
- What are you doing?

18:25.652 --> 18:27.419
(grunting)

18:27.454 --> 18:31.023
What are you doing? Stop it!
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

18:31.057 --> 18:32.435
I'm gonna break it so we can
get in and we can drive away!

18:32.459 --> 18:35.916
I can't drive the car, OK?
I don't have the car keys!

18:35.951 --> 18:37.329
Oh, you need them for the ignition.

18:37.364 --> 18:40.153
- Yes, I need them for the ignition, Mark!
- OK, I'm sorry, I forgot about that part.

18:40.188 --> 18:42.434
- Woah! Just hotwire it! Hotwire the car!
- Hotwire it?

18:42.469 --> 18:44.737
- I don't know how to hotwire a car! Touch the what? The wires?
- Touch the... Touch the...

18:44.771 --> 18:46.772
- The wires together. Touch the wires together!
- The wires?

18:46.806 --> 18:48.440
Like they do in the movies?
Like carjackers do in movies?

18:48.475 --> 18:50.476
- Yeah, yeah!
- That's a movie, Mark!

18:50.510 --> 18:52.083
OK, well, I don't know
what's movie and what's real!

18:52.146 --> 18:53.746
Oh, my God! Why didn't you think
before you go around

18:53.847 --> 18:56.648
- smashing things with the heel of a sword?!
- You say that like that's

18:56.683 --> 18:59.051
- a thing I do. I did that once.
- Oh, my...

18:59.085 --> 19:03.288
- Gentlemen!
- Should... sh-sh-should we run?

19:03.915 --> 19:07.393
Uh... No.

19:07.427 --> 19:09.495
- Don't worry, pal.
- What?

19:09.529 --> 19:11.530
- I got this.
- What are you doing?

19:11.564 --> 19:15.501
Annes, it's time for you to meet your...

19:15.535 --> 19:18.670
Oh, crap, it's decorative!
It's a decorative sword, Andy!

19:18.705 --> 19:21.573
- OK... Hi! Here's the thing...
- Andrew...

19:21.608 --> 19:24.043
You've broken a sacred
trust here tonight.

19:24.077 --> 19:28.347
We invited you into the fold
and you repaid us with deceit.

19:28.381 --> 19:30.682
This is your final warning:

19:31.427 --> 19:33.352
either tell us who you're working for

19:33.386 --> 19:35.421
or we will be forced...

19:38.243 --> 19:40.826
...to fire you from the play.

19:42.836 --> 19:45.230
- Is that it?
- Was that all that's gonna happen?

19:45.265 --> 19:47.866
- Creepy Ted!
- (terrified moans)

19:47.901 --> 19:49.835
Creepy Ted!

19:49.869 --> 19:52.271
- (all exclaiming)
- Vivian!

19:52.305 --> 19:57.743
I will not kiss in front of you,
you creepy horse-tugger!

19:57.777 --> 20:00.248
I was standing there, like,
what the hell is going on?

20:00.280 --> 20:03.582
And Andy starts screaming:
"I'm not Creepy Ted!"

20:03.616 --> 20:07.753
(laughing) "I'm not Creepy Ted!"

20:07.787 --> 20:10.556
"Please, I'm not Creepy Ted!"

20:10.590 --> 20:14.626
- That is so adorable!
- I'm gonna piss my pants!

20:14.661 --> 20:16.628
I'm telling you,
it's really good to laugh again.

20:16.663 --> 20:20.032
Shut up, Dr. Green.
This is why I don't open myself up

20:20.066 --> 20:22.234
to the universe!
Because nothing means anything!

20:22.268 --> 20:24.203
Travis opened himself up to the universe

20:24.237 --> 20:26.572
- and he got trampled to death!
- Well, medically speaking,

20:26.606 --> 20:29.108
that's nearly to death.
How are you doing, partner?

20:29.142 --> 20:32.711
Better. And at least, it took a
whole pack of them to take <i>me</i> down.

20:32.745 --> 20:35.581
(laughing)

20:35.615 --> 20:37.749
Hell yeah, Travis! That's my man!

20:37.784 --> 20:39.918
- You like Travis, now?
- I'm coming around to him.

20:39.953 --> 20:41.920
Oh... Anyway,
it looks like everything worked out

20:41.955 --> 20:44.089
in the end. You guys
will have to excuse me, though.

20:44.124 --> 20:46.091
I have to inform a
family that a loved one

20:46.126 --> 20:50.229
didn't make it, so... Excuse me.

20:50.263 --> 20:52.865
Hey! You guys wanna see some photos
of that old lady taking out Andy?

20:52.899 --> 20:54.800
- Yeah!
- You got photos?

20:54.834 --> 20:56.735
- Ow!
- (laughing)

20:56.769 --> 20:59.538
- That... that's it! Oh, woah!
- Come on, man!

20:59.572 --> 21:01.540
That's... That's his phone anyway.

21:01.574 --> 21:05.010
Bryn's got mine. (sighs)
