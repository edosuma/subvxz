00:17.756 --> 00:19.497
[Maggie] Previously on
Dead City...

00:19.628 --> 00:22.283
Have you seen this man?
Goes by the name of Negan.

00:22.413 --> 00:24.850
-They took your kid.
-They call him the Croat.

00:24.981 --> 00:26.939
[The Croat] I think you're
gonna like it here.

00:27.070 --> 00:28.332
[Negan] Hey, when this is over,

00:28.463 --> 00:29.768
will you look
after Ginny for me?

00:29.899 --> 00:31.596
I'll put up that girl.

00:31.727 --> 00:33.120
[Armstrong] Manhattan
was one of the epicenters.

00:33.250 --> 00:34.512
Military destroyed all
the bridges and tunnels

00:34.643 --> 00:35.948
hoping to contain it.

00:36.079 --> 00:37.298
[Maggie] The smoke
shows up like that

00:37.428 --> 00:38.255
every morning
at the same time.

00:38.386 --> 00:40.083
You're thinking
breakfast and dinner.

00:40.214 --> 00:41.519
[grunts]

00:41.650 --> 00:43.521
[walkers growling]

00:49.875 --> 00:53.966
[walkers growling]

01:05.630 --> 01:08.285
She's got my bag,
all our stuff.

01:10.679 --> 01:12.985
[walkers growling]

01:27.087 --> 01:29.089
Oh, come on, lady.
Don't make us chase you.

01:29.219 --> 01:31.874
Just give us the bag.

01:36.487 --> 01:39.011
[walkers growling]

01:45.322 --> 01:48.064
Just a ball of fun
hangin' out with you, ain't it?

01:48.195 --> 01:50.327
All right. Let's go.

01:51.894 --> 01:55.332
[walkers growling]

02:01.860 --> 02:07.910
[music]

02:10.955 --> 02:14.177
Eyes up, Maggie,
before you toss your cookies.

02:18.877 --> 02:23.273
[heavy breathing]

02:24.666 --> 02:30.846
[music]

02:38.070 --> 02:41.291
[heavy breathing]

02:47.732 --> 02:53.434
[music]

03:12.583 --> 03:14.237
Damn.

03:16.370 --> 03:18.328
Well, that's cool.

03:24.247 --> 03:26.380
What the hell's she doin'?

03:26.771 --> 03:28.338
[Speaking Hebrew]

03:32.124 --> 03:32.951
Ladies first.

03:33.082 --> 03:34.301
After you.

03:34.430 --> 03:36.520
[chuckles]

03:36.651 --> 03:39.697
[walkers growling]

03:48.097 --> 03:50.926
Holy shit. Ha, ha, ha, ha.

03:53.058 --> 03:56.366
[walkers growling]

04:00.631 --> 04:03.068
[heavy breathing]

04:03.199 --> 04:12.948
[music]

04:29.181 --> 04:30.922
Come on, Maggie.

04:31.053 --> 04:32.707
I got it.

04:41.890 --> 04:43.761
[walkers growling]

04:43.892 --> 04:49.637
[theme music]

05:34.290 --> 05:37.728
[birds singing]

05:37.859 --> 05:41.341
[music]

05:41.471 --> 05:45.388
[walker growling]

05:45.519 --> 05:47.608
-Thank you.
-There you go.

05:58.096 --> 06:00.795
Good morning, Nina.

06:00.925 --> 06:06.496
[music]

06:11.414 --> 06:16.898
Everyone, this is Ginny uh...
Just Ginny.

06:17.028 --> 06:19.248
She's, uh, come to us from
Oceanside

06:19.379 --> 06:21.816
and she's gonna be joining our
class from now on.

06:21.946 --> 06:23.687
Now, we're very privileged
to have her,

06:23.818 --> 06:25.994
and I expect y'all
to give her a big welcome.

06:26.124 --> 06:29.389
[clapping]

06:29.519 --> 06:31.521
Thank you, Nina.

06:31.652 --> 06:34.437
Oh, you can take
a seat now, Ginny.

06:34.568 --> 06:36.874
[sighing] Okay.

06:37.005 --> 06:40.748
Now, uh, yesterday we were
talking about foraging,

06:40.878 --> 06:44.186
and today we're gonna put that
learning to the test.

06:44.316 --> 06:49.321
Tell me, who can identify which
of these plants are edible?

07:06.469 --> 07:07.252
[Negan chuckling]
[Maggie] No!

07:07.383 --> 07:08.340
[Negan chuckling]

07:12.997 --> 07:15.435
It's all right.
You take that.

07:19.787 --> 07:21.136
[speaking Hebrew]

07:21.266 --> 07:23.704
[Negan] Cool.

07:23.834 --> 07:25.314
[speaking Hebrew]

07:25.445 --> 07:27.707
I think she wants to trade.

07:27.838 --> 07:29.927
Thank you.

07:30.972 --> 07:34.584
Oh. Pigeon?

07:36.586 --> 07:40.198
Mm, that's good.

07:40.329 --> 07:43.680
You've made your friend.
We need to go.

07:45.290 --> 07:47.641
Hey, excuse me.

07:47.771 --> 07:51.383
Can you take us there?
That building?

07:51.514 --> 07:53.734
Right there.
Where the smoke is.

07:53.864 --> 08:01.002
[speaking Hebrew]

08:01.132 --> 08:03.308
All right. I may be a little
bit rusty, but I'm pretty sure

08:03.439 --> 08:07.225
that translates into
hell freakin' no.

08:07.356 --> 08:09.227
Look, the way I see it,
we can either double back

08:09.358 --> 08:11.360
or we can see how
pigeon lady here plays out,

08:11.491 --> 08:12.970
but we go back,
all that's waitin' for us

08:13.101 --> 08:16.757
is a swarm of walkers
and a marshal's bullet.

08:16.887 --> 08:21.762
[speaking Hebrew]

08:21.892 --> 08:24.199
Come on.

08:27.332 --> 08:33.164
[walkers growling]

09:15.380 --> 09:21.212
[walkers growling]

09:26.348 --> 09:28.263

09:36.924 --> 09:40.057
[speaking Hebrew]

09:41.406 --> 09:44.671
[speaking Hebrew]

09:44.801 --> 09:46.716
-[Amaia] Esther, Zar.
-[Tommaso] Stop freaking out.

09:46.847 --> 09:48.718
-[Esther] [speaking Hebrew]
-Seriously?

09:48.849 --> 09:51.112
-[Amaia] Esther.
-[Esther] [speaking Hebrew]

09:51.242 --> 09:52.243
-[Tommaso] Come on.
-Zar, Esther!

09:52.374 --> 09:54.115
[Tommaso] Esther, Zar!

09:54.245 --> 09:57.031
Esther. Yo, every time with her.
It's like, she brings back

09:57.161 --> 09:58.336
fresh meat and we're
suddenly supposed to

09:58.467 --> 10:00.164
just take in these tourists?

10:00.295 --> 10:01.775
No offense, but you're the one
that's kinda freaking out now.

10:01.905 --> 10:04.952
-[Tommaso] I'm freaking out?
-[Esther] [speaking Hebrew]

10:05.082 --> 10:07.519
[Tommaso] Zar.
Did you not hear her say zar?

10:07.650 --> 10:09.043
It's like she don't even
understand her own language.

10:09.173 --> 10:10.435
I'm guessing they
are not with the Croat.

10:10.566 --> 10:12.307
Ya think?

10:12.437 --> 10:13.482
[Tommaso] Amaia, she's the one--

10:13.613 --> 10:16.267
Excuse me.
You don't know us.

10:16.398 --> 10:18.530
We don't know you.

10:18.661 --> 10:21.142
I'm not saying
that we're friendly,

10:21.272 --> 10:23.100
that depends on you,
but I don't think this crazy

10:23.231 --> 10:25.842
pigeon lady, no offense,
is gonna bring us all this way

10:25.973 --> 10:27.452
to get our asses smoked.

10:27.583 --> 10:29.541
Friendly?

10:29.672 --> 10:32.066
Does it look like
we need friends?

10:32.196 --> 10:34.372
We own this city.
There are thousands of us.

10:34.503 --> 10:37.332
I think it's more like,
what are you after?

10:39.508 --> 10:40.422
'Cause it's pretty obvious
you dickheads

10:40.552 --> 10:43.381
ain't from around here.

10:44.426 --> 10:46.733
We were heading up north
to a settlement in Canada.

10:46.863 --> 10:48.560
The boat washed us ashore
in a storm.

10:48.691 --> 10:49.649
We're just here until
we can get supplies

10:49.779 --> 10:52.695
and get on our way again.

10:52.826 --> 10:54.871
[sighs]

11:00.616 --> 11:02.226
Bullshit.

11:02.357 --> 11:05.665
[speaking Hebrew]

11:05.795 --> 11:07.797
[Amaia] Stop, Esther.

11:07.928 --> 11:11.366
Esther, you know what
happened last time.

11:11.496 --> 11:13.150
[Amaia] Enough, Esther.

11:13.281 --> 11:14.804
[Esther] [speaking Hebrew]

11:14.935 --> 11:18.155
-[Amaia] [speaking Spanish]
-[Esther] [speaking Hebrew]

11:20.854 --> 11:26.903
[music]

11:41.091 --> 11:43.180
[Tommaso] Luther.

11:43.311 --> 11:45.356
Mind searching this?

11:51.319 --> 11:53.190
Let's go.

11:57.107 --> 12:02.286
[music]

12:06.987 --> 12:09.424
[Negan sighs]
You're kiddin', right?

12:09.554 --> 12:13.297
Yeah. Ha. Ha.

12:18.694 --> 12:20.783
Don't get too comfortable.

12:21.479 --> 12:23.351
I know how you feel.

12:23.481 --> 12:26.571
It's hard to be in new places
with people you don't know.

12:26.702 --> 12:28.443
But these people,

12:28.573 --> 12:31.272
just might be like
family to you someday.

12:31.925 --> 12:34.231
You should eat something.

12:39.846 --> 12:42.805
You need anything,
don't hesitate to come find me.

12:42.936 --> 12:44.807
Okay?

13:02.694 --> 13:08.700
[music]

13:21.061 --> 13:23.759
[sighs] You missed
weapons training again.

13:23.890 --> 13:26.022
Lane brought out the bow staffs.

13:36.206 --> 13:39.296
It's the third time this
month that you skipped it.

13:40.471 --> 13:42.299
I can't keep telling you how
important it is to be ready

13:42.430 --> 13:44.649
-for anything.
-Ready at all times.

13:44.780 --> 13:48.392
Yeah, I got it.

13:49.829 --> 13:53.484
Hershel, it's not a joke.

13:53.615 --> 13:58.098
They could come
at you with anything.

13:58.228 --> 14:00.404
Then I guess I'd be dead.

14:00.535 --> 14:04.278
[scratching]

14:31.609 --> 14:33.915
It's really good.

14:34.612 --> 14:37.093
It sucks.

14:38.268 --> 14:41.097
I'm going over to Xander's.

14:47.277 --> 14:53.022
[music]

15:06.862 --> 15:08.995
[Negan] We didn't have
much of a choice.

15:09.125 --> 15:11.823
They had guns,
if you don't recall.

15:11.954 --> 15:14.652
Guns or whatever the hell
those things were.

15:14.783 --> 15:17.873
Either way, we fight back and we
end up with holes in our skulls.

15:18.004 --> 15:19.962
Or theirs.

15:20.093 --> 15:22.922
Maybe.

15:23.052 --> 15:24.532
But then what do we got?

15:24.662 --> 15:27.056
Us not being here.

15:27.187 --> 15:30.451
I am pretty sure that we are
here because you spun some yarn

15:30.581 --> 15:34.672
about Canada and a shipwreck
that reeked of bullshit, Maggie.

15:34.803 --> 15:36.413
Should I have told
them the truth?

15:36.544 --> 15:37.980
Yeah. We give a little.
They give a little.

15:38.111 --> 15:41.114
That's how it works.

15:41.244 --> 15:46.032
I mean, sure, they stuck us
in some dank ass bathroom.

15:46.162 --> 15:48.643
Right or wrong,
they had their reasons,

15:48.773 --> 15:51.820
which, by the way,
makes them useful.

15:51.951 --> 15:55.606
For what?

15:55.737 --> 15:57.957
Manpower,

15:58.087 --> 15:59.610
information.

15:59.741 --> 16:04.876
Information? That's what I
thought you were here for.

16:05.007 --> 16:08.663
Been pretty tight-lipped
about the Croat.

16:13.668 --> 16:16.453
Right around the time that the
world turned into shit soup,

16:16.584 --> 16:20.196
the Croat showed up at my door,
so to speak.

16:20.327 --> 16:23.112
He had been through...

16:23.243 --> 16:26.768
Well, let's just say he had been
through some really bad shit.

16:26.898 --> 16:30.772
Worst shit imaginable.

16:30.902 --> 16:34.080
So I took him in.

16:34.210 --> 16:37.213
Kept him from brain-painting
the walls.

16:37.344 --> 16:39.607
Pretty soon he was
calling me his brother,

16:39.737 --> 16:43.132
Buraz.

16:43.263 --> 16:46.483
He said that I
made him feel safe.

16:46.614 --> 16:49.051
Well, I guess at that point
everybody was looking for

16:49.182 --> 16:51.314
a little sanctuary
from the hellfire

16:51.445 --> 16:55.579
we'd all been damned to.
I mean, we'd lost everything.

16:56.667 --> 17:01.368
[sighs]
The thing is I um...

17:02.238 --> 17:05.241
I really thought
I was helping him.

17:06.460 --> 17:08.853
It takes a monster
to make one, I guess.

17:08.983 --> 17:10.724
No.

17:11.377 --> 17:14.337
No.

17:14.468 --> 17:18.950
You see, I was only a monster
when I absolutely had to be.

17:19.080 --> 17:23.738
When I had to put on a show
to protect my people.

17:25.957 --> 17:28.351
Anyway, the...

17:28.482 --> 17:32.268
The Croat, he had a way of,
um...

17:32.399 --> 17:34.096
Reading people.

17:34.227 --> 17:36.968
And then toying with them.

17:37.099 --> 17:40.102
And pulling them apart.

17:40.233 --> 17:42.496
When a threat
needed to be handled,

17:42.626 --> 17:47.066
it was a skill set
that I found very useful.

17:47.196 --> 17:50.286
He was your torturer.

17:52.071 --> 17:54.334
He took it too far.

17:54.464 --> 17:56.205
It was, um...

17:56.336 --> 18:00.122
One of our first skirmishes with
the Kingdom before your time.

18:00.253 --> 18:02.907
A person had been
holed up in a car

18:03.038 --> 18:06.607
a couple of miles
from the sanctuary.

18:06.737 --> 18:10.045
It seemed to me she was a...
drifter.

18:10.176 --> 18:15.964
Nothing to do with us
or anything we were up to.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.140
So I gave a direct order.

18:18.271 --> 18:20.403
Let her walk.

18:20.534 --> 18:23.580
But the Croat, he, uh,
he saw it differently.

18:23.711 --> 18:25.930
Thought that the, uh...

18:26.061 --> 18:29.891
Thought that she had
beans to spill.

18:30.021 --> 18:32.111
And he was right.

18:32.241 --> 18:36.463
She was a... a scout.

18:36.593 --> 18:40.380
At least that's what she copped
to before, uh...

18:41.511 --> 18:43.818
[sighs]

18:45.298 --> 18:47.604
Before he...[sighs]

18:53.741 --> 18:56.396
She was just a kid.

18:58.528 --> 19:02.228
So after that, I knew
that he was a rabid dog

19:02.358 --> 19:05.361
that needed to be put down.

19:07.058 --> 19:09.626
I had one shot.

19:09.757 --> 19:12.151
One.

19:12.760 --> 19:14.892
I missed.

19:15.502 --> 19:18.635
Blew off his ear.
The rest of him got away.

19:20.420 --> 19:22.813
I haven't seen
or heard from him since.

19:25.120 --> 19:27.644
Until now, of course.

19:31.779 --> 19:35.043
So he's gonna want to kill you?

19:35.174 --> 19:38.046
He sure is.

19:39.526 --> 19:43.356
You didn't think to
tell me this before?

19:43.486 --> 19:46.446
