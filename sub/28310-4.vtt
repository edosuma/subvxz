00:04.570 --> 00:07.969
This is Captain Edward Penisi
to dispatch. You're a go.

00:07.970 --> 00:10.309
The Tacoma Fire Department
welcomes Ms. Parker's

00:10.310 --> 00:12.959
fifth grade class from
Patterson Elementary School

00:12.960 --> 00:14.719
and Councilwoman Linda Price.

00:14.720 --> 00:16.329
Yeah, that's you guys.

00:17.340 --> 00:18.819
All right, kids, come on over here.

00:18.820 --> 00:21.500
All right, first up... the fire pole.

00:21.501 --> 00:24.546
We slide down this when we're
ready to race off to a fire.

00:26.710 --> 00:27.899
How you doing?

00:27.900 --> 00:30.290
Okay, it's important for
firefighters to always...

00:30.300 --> 00:32.920
Hey, let me slide down
that pole, fire guy!

00:32.929 --> 00:34.972
Hunter... the kid from the well.

00:34.973 --> 00:36.199
How do I get up that pole?!

00:36.200 --> 00:37.550
- You don't.
- Okay, then.

00:37.559 --> 00:38.869
Let's mess with the Dalmatian.

00:38.870 --> 00:40.769
We actually don't have one.
The Chief doesn't like dogs.

00:40.770 --> 00:42.519
That guy's a boner!

00:42.520 --> 00:44.939
He still owes me 25 bucks and a vape!

00:44.940 --> 00:48.009
Remember, Captain,
little Hunter is a hero.

00:48.010 --> 00:49.027
You're doing great.

00:49.028 --> 00:50.571
All right, come on,
everybody. Right this way.

00:50.572 --> 00:53.079
- They're all yours.
- All right, Cap, thank you.

00:53.080 --> 00:56.109
Hey, guys. This is the engine truck.

00:56.110 --> 00:58.679
We use this on all of our house
calls, people get lock...

00:58.680 --> 01:00.499
Hey, everybody, this is the guy

01:00.500 --> 01:02.619
I kicked in the nuts in Episode 258:

01:02.620 --> 01:03.759
The Sky Below.

01:03.760 --> 01:05.239
Well, someone's not gonna be keeping

01:05.239 --> 01:07.129
their little helmet after the tour.

01:07.130 --> 01:10.479
And this is my ding dong!

01:10.480 --> 01:13.800
Hey, buddy. You know, that
hose is very powerful.

01:13.803 --> 01:16.509
It shoots water at 400 PSI.

01:16.510 --> 01:18.432
Now, do you know what PSI stands for?

01:18.433 --> 01:22.144
It stands for "Corrupt
dem nuts, shorty."

01:22.145 --> 01:23.379
Come on, man.

01:23.380 --> 01:24.479
Oh, uh, one more photo by the truck.

01:24.480 --> 01:26.400
- Come on, everyone.
- Oh, yeah, sure, a picture.

01:27.080 --> 01:28.730
Oh, not...

01:28.735 --> 01:31.399
All right, over here. Welcome.

01:31.400 --> 01:33.719
- My name is Granny Smith...
- Hey.

01:33.720 --> 01:35.699
... and I am the station medic,

01:35.700 --> 01:38.919
and I'm also a firefighter,
so I help fight fires.

01:40.400 --> 01:41.619
Who charged that hose?

01:41.620 --> 01:43.319
Andy, did you close the
gate on that deck cannon?

01:43.320 --> 01:46.280
Going viral, bitches!

01:47.920 --> 01:49.409
Huh?! You want some?!

01:49.410 --> 01:50.809
How about you?

01:50.810 --> 01:52.758
How about you?!

01:52.759 --> 01:54.343
- Who wants some?!
- Get down! Get down!

01:54.344 --> 01:55.809
- Oh, yeah!
- No!

01:55.810 --> 01:57.209
Aaaaaaaaaaaah!

01:57.210 --> 01:58.879
Oh! Whoa!

01:58.880 --> 02:00.557
Come here, you little brat.

02:00.558 --> 02:02.419
I'm pissed!

02:02.420 --> 02:04.080
All kids, cover your ears!

02:04.800 --> 02:08.348
You mother...

02:08.350 --> 02:10.459
Your balls are mine!

02:10.460 --> 02:14.196
And I'm gonna run them
over with my scooter!

02:14.197 --> 02:16.229
I guess I did forget to close the gate.

02:16.230 --> 02:17.240
Yeah.

Don't subscribe to him.

02:46.220 --> 02:48.079
Hey, keep that shame helmet on, okay?

02:48.080 --> 02:49.269
- You wear it all week.
- Yeah.

02:49.270 --> 02:51.219
Yeah, you messed up and
left the gate open, okay?

02:51.220 --> 02:52.419
- Punishment for you.
- Boo, boo!

02:52.420 --> 02:54.611
- Shame! Shame!
- I got it!

02:54.612 --> 02:56.569
- Morning.
- Hey, Chief.

02:56.570 --> 02:57.739
- Hey, good morning.
- Good morning.

02:57.740 --> 02:59.579
Myawani, put that shame helmet back on.

02:59.580 --> 03:00.739
All week long.

03:00.740 --> 03:02.599
Okay, so it should come as no surprise

03:02.600 --> 03:04.037
that Linda Price wants blood.

03:04.038 --> 03:06.719
Oh, well, I believe the TFD blood drive

03:06.720 --> 03:08.549
falls on May 5th this year,

03:08.550 --> 03:11.289
so I'm happy to send a
flier to her office.

03:11.290 --> 03:13.714
Okay, that's not, uh...

03:13.715 --> 03:15.966
The Commissioner spent the
morning trying to talk her down.

03:15.967 --> 03:16.969
So we're off the hook.

03:16.970 --> 03:18.239
No, to appease her,

03:18.240 --> 03:19.559
the station has been ordered to undergo

03:19.560 --> 03:21.596
a mandatory training recertification.

03:21.597 --> 03:22.931
- What?
- Aww, boo!

03:22.932 --> 03:23.939
- The station?
- I just got...

03:23.940 --> 03:24.949
I just got certified.

03:24.950 --> 03:26.939
- That includes captains.
- Double boo, that's it.

03:26.940 --> 03:27.969
Okay, sorry.

03:27.970 --> 03:29.799
The cert trainer will
be here this morning.

03:29.800 --> 03:31.273
Enjoy your training day.

03:31.274 --> 03:32.941
Oh, Eddie. You'll be happy to hear

03:32.942 --> 03:35.610
the trainer is none other
than Wolf Boykins.

03:35.611 --> 03:37.154
Boykins? You got to be kidding me.

03:37.155 --> 03:38.321
Who is Wolf Boykins?

03:38.322 --> 03:39.919
The worst firefighter ever.

03:39.920 --> 03:41.579
He went through Academy
with me and Terry.

03:41.580 --> 03:44.244
He's one of those guys who
teaches 'cause he can't do.

03:44.245 --> 03:45.537
Oh, like a captain.

03:47.190 --> 03:49.666
- Ah! Hey, man, come on.
- I love this thing.

03:49.667 --> 03:51.059
You think the Captain busts balls.

03:51.060 --> 03:52.335
He was relentless on Wolf.

03:52.336 --> 03:54.009
- He deserved it.
- They always do, right, Eddie?

03:54.010 --> 03:55.019
Yes, they do.

03:55.020 --> 03:57.069
You just remember... he
controls your certification,

03:57.070 --> 03:59.339
so mind your manners, and be nice.

03:59.340 --> 04:00.349
- Maybe.
- Wait,

04:00.350 --> 04:01.739
Chief, don't you have to get certified?

04:01.740 --> 04:03.609
No. Chiefs don't get certified.

04:03.610 --> 04:04.809
I'm a chief!

04:04.810 --> 04:06.339
But Linda Price did give me

04:06.340 --> 04:07.739
my own pain-in-the-ass assignment.

04:07.740 --> 04:09.978
I have to file a sensitivity
compliance report tomorrow.

04:09.979 --> 04:12.009
We should start by getting
softer toilet paper

04:12.010 --> 04:13.523
for the bathrooms, if I may.

04:13.524 --> 04:15.749
Yes, yes, I vote yes.

04:15.750 --> 04:17.839
That's not the sensitivity
I was talking about.

04:17.839 --> 04:19.289
Now that we have a female firefighter,

04:19.290 --> 04:21.238
I have to go down the checklist
to make sure we comply.

04:21.240 --> 04:22.908
I told you, no special treatment.

04:22.909 --> 04:24.868
Regardless, the place has
to be suitable for women.

04:24.869 --> 04:26.369
We need adequate facilities.

04:26.370 --> 04:27.829
No longer are we allowed to use

04:27.830 --> 04:29.998
improper gender-specific language.

04:29.999 --> 04:30.999
Like what?

04:31.000 --> 04:32.229
I made a list...

04:32.230 --> 04:33.839
"Things we are no
longer allowed to say."

04:33.840 --> 04:36.209
From now on, we are
firefighters, not firemen.

04:36.210 --> 04:37.500
- Oh, yeah.
- Okay, that's fair.

04:37.510 --> 04:39.219
- Fine.
- We can no longer call each other

04:39.220 --> 04:40.550
pussies or douche bags.

04:40.551 --> 04:43.595
I got called both those
names, so I'm happy.

04:43.596 --> 04:45.680
The hose nozzle will no
longer be called the knob.

04:45.681 --> 04:46.979
Aw, man.

04:46.980 --> 04:48.979
- Come on.
- What are we gonna call it?

04:48.980 --> 04:50.727
I mean, it's the knob.

04:50.728 --> 04:53.119
When we charge the line,
we no longer shout,

04:53.120 --> 04:54.898
"Make the hose round and hard."

04:54.899 --> 04:56.441
- Aww, come on!
- That's the best one!

04:56.442 --> 04:58.929
And the person sliding down
the pole will no longer be

04:58.930 --> 05:00.479
"polishing the pole."

05:00.480 --> 05:02.400
Can we even say "pole"?

05:02.410 --> 05:04.129
Actually, in the Academy,

05:04.130 --> 05:05.599
all the men were required to call it

05:05.600 --> 05:07.080
the floor-to-floor conveyance device.

05:08.400 --> 05:10.399
Oh. Seriously?

05:10.400 --> 05:13.219
Seriously. So, no, you can't say "pole,"

05:13.220 --> 05:14.229
but I still can.

05:14.230 --> 05:16.279
- Oh.
- But, Chief, we can still use

05:16.280 --> 05:18.160
that phrase periodically, though, right?

05:18.170 --> 05:20.659
Andy, you cannot say "periodically."

05:20.660 --> 05:21.980
- Come on.
- Wha...

05:21.990 --> 05:23.359
Dude, times have changed.

05:23.360 --> 05:26.019
Up in Olympia, they have
this Dalmatian named Spot.

05:26.020 --> 05:27.980
Had to change the name 'cause
that's super inappropriate

05:27.990 --> 05:29.266
- to menstruating women.
- Mm.

05:29.267 --> 05:31.559
They renamed him, but
he wouldn't respond

05:31.560 --> 05:33.139
to anything else...

05:33.140 --> 05:34.396
so they had to put him down.

05:34.397 --> 05:35.519
- What?
- Krk!

05:38.442 --> 05:41.699
They put the dog to sleep because...

05:41.700 --> 05:44.260
because of what, women's
lib or something?

05:44.270 --> 05:45.909
But you got to get it, too, right?

05:45.910 --> 05:48.076
Yeah, remind me never to go to Olympia.

05:48.077 --> 05:49.079
All right, enough of this.

05:49.080 --> 05:50.799
I'm gonna post this list
out in the break room.

05:50.800 --> 05:51.872
Add to it if you want.

05:51.873 --> 05:54.374
In the meantime, have a great
training day, everybody.

05:57.050 --> 05:58.119
Mm-hmm. I like it.

05:58.120 --> 05:59.920
The dog... that's a nice touch.

05:59.922 --> 06:01.550
- You're good, noob. You're good.
- What can I say?

06:01.560 --> 06:03.000
It's the Penisi in me.

06:03.700 --> 06:05.590
All right, easy on these guys.

06:05.595 --> 06:07.929
This cert training's gonna be busted.

06:07.930 --> 06:09.320
What a pain in the ass.

06:09.330 --> 06:11.869
Humping the gear, taking the
test, racing the clock...

06:11.870 --> 06:13.669
I mean, we're seasoned veterans.

06:13.670 --> 06:15.145
- Yes, we are.
- Let's make it interesting.

06:15.146 --> 06:16.809
How about this?

06:16.810 --> 06:18.339
Person who tests the highest

06:18.340 --> 06:19.774
wins the Fart Jar.

06:19.775 --> 06:22.279
- Mmm.
- Ooh!

06:22.280 --> 06:23.380
Right? Want to try it?

06:24.080 --> 06:25.739
Fart Jar, everyone, okay?

06:28.040 --> 06:30.019
My deposit for the week.

06:30.020 --> 06:31.299
- Here we are.
- Yeah, see, Granny,

06:31.300 --> 06:33.030
that's why I always carry singles.

06:33.039 --> 06:35.413
No, you carry 'em 'cause
you hang out in strip clubs.

06:35.414 --> 06:38.200
- I guess.
- Wow, that is a lot of farts.

06:38.210 --> 06:40.159
Oh, you think this is a lot?

06:40.160 --> 06:41.499
This is just the tip.

06:41.500 --> 06:43.699
Hold on. Look at this. Bam.

06:43.700 --> 06:45.499
- Yeah. Hello.
- Boom.

06:45.500 --> 06:46.551
- Boop!
- Oh, yeah.

06:46.552 --> 06:48.699
- Bong.
- Wait.

06:48.700 --> 06:50.013
- November?
- Wow.

06:50.014 --> 06:51.932
You guys have had a big year.

06:51.933 --> 06:54.351
It's a lot.

06:54.352 --> 06:56.649
Hey, just so you guys know, I'm
still in top training form

06:56.650 --> 06:59.481
from the Academy, so you guys are toast.

06:59.482 --> 07:02.651
Are women even eligible? I
mean, do you even fart?

07:05.590 --> 07:07.990
I think they're like Barbies.
They don't have butts.

07:08.990 --> 07:10.119
How is that offensive?

07:10.120 --> 07:12.389
If you don't know it's inappropriate,

07:12.390 --> 07:13.788
it's even more offensive.

07:13.789 --> 07:14.789
Oh, is that so?

07:23.470 --> 07:26.679
Stop! Stop, stop,

07:26.680 --> 07:29.139
stop, stop, stop.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.060
Just with my naked eye,

07:32.070 --> 07:34.419
I can spot seven things
you guys did wrong

07:34.420 --> 07:36.219
before you even rolled
out of the garage,

07:36.220 --> 07:38.349
so it's gonna be a long day.

07:38.350 --> 07:40.289
Everybody, this is Wolf Boykins.

07:40.290 --> 07:42.459
Wolf Boykins, your
certification trainer.

07:42.460 --> 07:45.318
Captain, long time no "Peni-see."

07:46.320 --> 07:47.487
Good one.

07:47.488 --> 07:50.569
This... I love it... not regulation.

07:50.570 --> 07:52.160
Lose it.

07:52.170 --> 07:53.179
- Hey!
- Hey!

07:53.180 --> 07:54.980
Wolf Boykins, how the hell are ya?

07:55.000 --> 07:57.109
Eh, okay.

07:57.110 --> 07:58.169
Good to see you, Chief.

07:58.170 --> 07:59.779
Good to see you. We're
excited to have you.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.039
As a matter of fact, the Captain

08:01.040 --> 08:02.379
was just telling me how excited he is.

08:02.380 --> 08:03.979
- Tell him.
- I... I said that.

08:03.980 --> 08:05.509
I said I'm really excited
to see Wolf today.

08:05.510 --> 08:07.249
Well, that's great, 'cause
the word on the street

08:07.250 --> 08:08.740
is you guys are a bunch of hosers...

08:08.750 --> 08:12.020
of little kids and one
unlucky councilwoman.

08:12.040 --> 08:15.789
So, I'm here because you...
guys... are... slop-py.

08:15.790 --> 08:18.499
Pbbt! But I'm the napkin, okay?

08:18.500 --> 08:20.129
So welcome to the wolves den.

08:20.130 --> 08:22.180
Awrooooo!

08:22.800 --> 08:24.199
Hey, why don't we all
do it just to kick off

08:24.200 --> 08:25.469
the session right, huh?

08:25.470 --> 08:27.109
On three... One, two, three...

08:27.110 --> 08:28.120
Awroo!

08:28.870 --> 08:30.405
- Awroo.
- Awoo.

08:30.406 --> 08:31.409
I promise you, it's not gonna be weird

08:31.410 --> 08:32.808
if everybody does it, okay?

08:32.809 --> 08:34.139
Awrooo!

08:34.140 --> 08:35.940
- Wooooo.
- Huh?

08:43.450 --> 08:45.360
Bathroom sensitivity compliance.

08:46.790 --> 08:47.989
Okay.

08:47.990 --> 08:50.540
Oh, look at this crap.

08:51.190 --> 08:52.799
Grandcougar? That's disgusting.

08:52.800 --> 08:53.846
What's wrong with these guys?

08:53.847 --> 08:55.160
Naked Ass Girls?

08:55.180 --> 08:56.719
Oh, man.

08:56.720 --> 08:59.600
Oh, shut up.

08:59.640 --> 09:02.130
"Hot Grill on Grill Action"...

09:02.140 --> 09:04.269
Summer recipes, I love it.

09:04.270 --> 09:06.279
Uh-huh.

09:06.280 --> 09:07.419
Oh.

09:07.420 --> 09:09.235
I always pegged you for
a European tits guy.

09:09.236 --> 09:10.679
I was reading an article.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.155
Yeah, right on.

09:12.156 --> 09:13.364
What are you doing in here?

09:13.365 --> 09:15.479
Going to the bathroom.

09:15.480 --> 09:16.749
This is the men's room.

09:16.750 --> 09:19.034
Well, when we get a women's
room, let me know.

09:19.035 --> 09:20.519
Okay, you know what? New rule.

09:20.520 --> 09:22.665
From now on, you use
the Chief's restroom

09:22.666 --> 09:24.429
until we make other arrangements.

09:24.430 --> 09:26.659
Dad, I said no special treatment.

09:26.660 --> 09:28.959
I'm not gonna share a bathroom with you.

09:28.960 --> 09:30.673
The guys would never let
me hear the end of that.

09:30.674 --> 09:32.959
Hey, I'm the Chief, and
that's the way it's gonna be.

09:32.960 --> 09:34.919
Fine, you want to do
everything up to compliance?

09:34.920 --> 09:37.514
Then you have to install a
tampon dispenser in there.

09:37.515 --> 09:39.265
What, like one of those
coin-operated things?

09:39.266 --> 09:41.017
And will you put those
menstrual cups in?

09:41.018 --> 09:42.435
- Those are great.
- I don't even know what that is.

09:42.436 --> 09:43.937
Oh, and we also need a bidet.

09:43.938 --> 09:45.109
Like the water jet thingy?

09:45.110 --> 09:47.049
They're regulation now.
They're in all women's rooms.

09:47.050 --> 09:48.059
Where do you get a bidet?

09:48.060 --> 09:49.640
Home Depot.

09:49.660 --> 09:51.500
And don't worry. I'll bring my own porn.

09:52.190 --> 09:53.989
Not in my bathroom!

09:53.990 --> 09:56.259
All right, here we go.

09:56.260 --> 09:59.279
Wh-Wh-Whoa.

09:59.280 --> 10:01.100
All right, what the...

10:01.110 --> 10:03.130
Mnh.

10:04.208 --> 10:05.869
- Cool suspenders.
- Thanks.

10:05.870 --> 10:07.299
They're a gift from Rudy Giuliani.

10:07.300 --> 10:09.199
- America's Mayor.
- Oh, yeah, right.

10:09.200 --> 10:10.739
I forgot how connected you were.

10:10.740 --> 10:12.139
Oh, my gosh,

10:12.140 --> 10:14.175
thanks for joining us,
McConky. What an honor.

10:14.176 --> 10:15.844
Okay, now, listen.

10:15.845 --> 10:17.609
A firefighter's turnout gear

10:17.610 --> 10:19.430
is their most important
piece of equipment,

10:19.431 --> 10:21.516
okay? Putting it on
quickly is essential.

10:21.517 --> 10:24.644
So, first up, the 39-second drill.

10:24.645 --> 10:28.022
You guys have 39 seconds to
get into your full gear.

10:28.023 --> 10:30.959
Until you get 39 seconds,
you are not certified.

10:30.960 --> 10:32.699
My personal best is seven seconds.

10:32.700 --> 10:33.862
I don't expect you to hit that.

10:33.863 --> 10:35.822
All the gear... everything...
seven seconds?

10:35.823 --> 10:37.620
Yeah, maybe six. I...
I wasn't... you know.

10:37.630 --> 10:39.619
Man, I bet everybody here

10:39.620 --> 10:41.779
would love to see you do
that in seven seconds.

10:41.780 --> 10:43.049
- Yeah.
- That'd be great.

10:43.050 --> 10:44.909
I'm sure you all would.
I'm sure you all would.

10:44.910 --> 10:47.208
But it's not about me.
It's about you guys today.

10:47.209 --> 10:48.779
Though this does remind me of the time

10:48.780 --> 10:51.255
when my SCBA malfunctioned
in the middle of this fire...

10:51.256 --> 10:52.340
And go!

10:52.350 --> 10:53.399
- Oh!
- Go!

10:56.850 --> 10:58.719
Tick, tick, tick...

11:04.990 --> 11:06.129
And time!

11:07.271 --> 11:10.106
Not bad, McConky... 32 seconds.

11:10.107 --> 11:11.858
The rest of you clowns fail.

11:11.859 --> 11:13.233
While you were getting zipped up,

11:13.234 --> 11:15.460
Little Jimmy's wooden
leg burst into flames.

11:15.470 --> 11:16.653
I'm sorry, he's dead.

11:16.654 --> 11:18.939
So we're all gonna do it
again except McConky.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.860
Next!

11:23.320 --> 11:25.159
Uh, steady, Penisi... you wish.

11:25.160 --> 11:26.170
Next!

11:27.760 --> 11:29.839
What, did you stop for
a taco halfway down?

11:29.840 --> 11:30.860
Next!

11:31.660 --> 11:33.129
How's your pole technique?

11:33.130 --> 11:34.639
- Ike.
- Oh...

11:34.640 --> 11:35.999
We have already covered this, buddy.

11:36.000 --> 11:38.135
No, I know. I... Look... Hmm...

11:38.136 --> 11:40.040
I mean, how is your, uh,

11:40.060 --> 11:42.130
floor-to-floor conveyance technique?

11:42.139 --> 11:44.391
Relax. I'm not gonna
report you to FOOFA.

11:44.392 --> 11:45.579
FOO... FOOFA?

11:45.580 --> 11:48.380
The Female Order Of
Firefighters Association?

11:48.400 --> 11:50.271
What are... That's a thing?

11:50.272 --> 11:52.819
It is, but you need at
least five infractions

11:52.820 --> 11:54.059
before FOOFA sanctions you.

11:54.060 --> 11:56.019
And you only have four, so, we're cool.

11:56.020 --> 11:57.029
How...

11:57.030 --> 11:58.299
- Crystal? Crystal!
- Okay...

11:58.300 --> 12:00.110
- Crystal, you're up!
- 'Cause I'm trying... oh, man.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.859
- Crystal!
- Wait, what are sanctions?

12:01.860 --> 12:03.100
Crystal!!

12:03.110 --> 12:05.249
Quit with the yackety-yak,
okay? You're up.

12:05.250 --> 12:06.779
Okay, I got to go.

12:06.780 --> 12:08.160
Don't lose focus.

12:08.170 --> 12:11.709
The problem with losing focus
is you can start to lose focus,

12:11.710 --> 12:15.713
and of the thing you tan to
take the Australian table wine.

12:15.714 --> 12:16.719
Oh!

12:16.720 --> 12:18.841
- Whoa! Hey, hey!
- Oh! Oh!

12:18.842 --> 12:20.322
Take his belt off. Take his belt off.

12:21.200 --> 12:22.679
And I'm dead!

12:22.680 --> 12:24.264
- Ah.
- Oh, are you kidding me?

12:24.265 --> 12:26.432
A firefighter has got to
be ready for anything,

12:26.433 --> 12:29.519
including their instructor
having a seizure.

12:29.520 --> 12:30.679
That is a fail.

12:30.680 --> 12:33.019
Well... Well, that's not
cool. That's not cool.

12:36.550 --> 12:39.639
- _
- Ah. Some new additions.

12:39.640 --> 12:41.540
Ass-fixiate.

12:41.550 --> 12:43.074
I don't think you spell it like that.

12:43.075 --> 12:45.559
Wet.

12:45.560 --> 12:46.744
What's wrong with that?

12:46.745 --> 12:48.079
- Hey, Chief?
- Yeah.

12:48.080 --> 12:50.160
I'd like to file an official complaint

12:50.170 --> 12:52.709
under the new sensitivity
compliance guidelines.

12:52.710 --> 12:53.760
You want to file a complaint?

12:53.770 --> 12:55.739
Yes, sir. Against Wolf Boykins.

12:55.740 --> 12:58.289
- For what?
- He said I look like Baby Godzilla.

13:00.600 --> 13:02.176
- You're serious?
- Yes.

13:02.177 --> 13:03.919
- Okay, okay.
- It was in front of everyone,

13:03.920 --> 13:05.399
and everyone laughed,

13:05.400 --> 13:06.540
and it made me feel uncomfortable.

13:06.550 --> 13:07.620
Hmm.

13:14.660 --> 13:17.900
His real name is Minya...
Baby Godzilla's real name.

13:17.901 --> 13:19.059
Hmm?

13:19.060 --> 13:20.069
Thanks, Chief.

13:20.070 --> 13:21.240
You got it.

13:22.140 --> 13:23.660
Do you look like Baby Godzilla?

13:23.700 --> 13:25.319
What? No!

13:28.470 --> 13:30.869
Hm.

13:30.870 --> 13:32.080
Mm...

13:42.150 --> 13:43.889
Can anybody tell me the three things

13:43.890 --> 13:45.289
Penisi's doing wrong right now?

13:45.290 --> 13:46.804
Somebody, please? Anybody?

13:46.805 --> 13:50.159
Smith, what's the most important
part of mating a hydrant?

13:50.160 --> 13:51.184
- Uh...
- Fail.

13:51.185 --> 13:52.229
Dah!

13:52.230 --> 13:55.688
My baby! My baby! A dingo ate my baby!

13:55.689 --> 13:57.029
- Not gonna work, Wolf.
- Oh, look.

13:57.030 --> 13:58.399
Who dropped their $20 million bill?

13:58.400 --> 13:59.769
Not working, Wolf.

13:59.770 --> 14:01.850
- Hey, hey!
- Hey! Hey!

14:01.860 --> 14:04.650
- Come on!
- And that is a fail.

14:04.656 --> 14:06.379
You see your crew?

14:06.380 --> 14:07.979
They're all relying on you for water,

14:07.980 --> 14:09.039
but, nope, now they're dead.

14:09.040 --> 14:10.109
Come on, Wolf.

14:10.110 --> 14:12.019
'Cause someone had an
air horn at a fire?

14:12.020 --> 14:13.414
You know, it's funny bring that up.

14:13.415 --> 14:16.449
Back in '09, we had a fire
and very low water pressure.

14:16.450 --> 14:18.389
So here I am. I'm up on the 60th floor,

14:18.390 --> 14:19.962
and I'm pulling down
ceilings, you know...

14:19.963 --> 14:21.659
Oh, really? That's weird, 'cause
there's no building in Tacoma

14:21.660 --> 14:23.210
that's taller than 30 stories.

14:23.217 --> 14:24.589
What's that, now?

14:24.590 --> 14:25.620
What I'm saying is you
couldn't have been

14:25.630 --> 14:27.279
on the 60th floor, 'cause
there's nothing in Tacoma

14:27.280 --> 14:28.329
that's even half that height.

14:28.330 --> 14:31.182
- Ooh!
- Maybe I wasn't in Tacoma.

14:31.183 --> 14:33.869
Oh, so you worked for a
different fire department?

14:33.870 --> 14:35.269
I'm confused, 'cause your story's

14:35.270 --> 14:37.100
just kind of got some holes in it.

14:38.780 --> 14:40.460
It never stops with
you, does it, Penisi?

14:40.470 --> 14:42.193
You never know when to hold that
pretty little tongue of yours.

14:42.194 --> 14:44.099
Well, guess what. Now
it's gonna come back,

14:44.100 --> 14:45.360
and it's gonna hurt your whole crew.

14:45.364 --> 14:46.904
Exactly how do you mean that, sir?

14:46.905 --> 14:49.119
You want this crew certified? Okay.

14:49.120 --> 14:51.949
Well, we'll be here all
day and all night.

14:51.950 --> 14:53.371
'Cause it's my game now.

14:53.372 --> 14:55.559
And it just went into the fifth quarter.

14:55.560 --> 14:56.839
The fuck are you talking about?

14:56.840 --> 14:58.650
Wolfball.

15:01.672 --> 15:04.229
Okay, bunk room privacy.

15:06.170 --> 15:08.779
Great. Easy peasy.

15:08.780 --> 15:10.680
I can't take this guy anymore.
You got to get in there.

15:10.681 --> 15:12.239
You're pushing his buttons.
That's what you do.

15:12.240 --> 15:13.683
I'm not. The guy's full of shit.

15:13.684 --> 15:15.849
I get it. Eddie Penisi
doesn't suffer fools.

15:15.850 --> 15:18.909
But, hey, sometimes you got
to suck it up and apologize.

15:18.910 --> 15:20.395
I'm not apologizing to this guy.

15:20.396 --> 15:22.079
He controls your certification.

15:22.080 --> 15:23.234
Just apologize.

15:23.235 --> 15:25.189
And not one of those
half-assed apologies you do.

15:25.190 --> 15:26.519
You know, like, the...

15:26.520 --> 15:27.612
"I'm sorry."

15:27.613 --> 15:28.999
Oh, that's how I say I'm sorry?

15:29.000 --> 15:30.009
Yeah, that's how you say it.

15:30.010 --> 15:31.529
"I'm sorry"... that's what I do?

15:31.530 --> 15:34.090
- I'm sorry.
- Okay, check this out.

15:34.680 --> 15:35.739
Sorry.

15:35.740 --> 15:37.489
Totally insincere.

15:37.490 --> 15:38.499
I don't believe it for a second.

15:38.500 --> 15:40.020
- You do it.
- All right, watch, ready?

15:41.070 --> 15:42.109
I'm sorry.

15:42.110 --> 15:43.119
The worst.

15:43.120 --> 15:44.797
- What are you talking about?
- The worst. Also, fake.

15:44.798 --> 15:46.119
Check this out.

15:46.120 --> 15:47.133
Sorry.

15:47.134 --> 15:48.339
I'm really sorry.

15:48.340 --> 15:49.940
I never meant to hurt you.

15:49.950 --> 15:51.345
I swear, I'm so sorry.

15:51.346 --> 15:52.749
Straight up, I'm sorry.

15:52.750 --> 15:54.600
Don't you blame yourself.

15:54.610 --> 15:55.766
I did it. I'm sorry.

15:55.767 --> 15:58.186
Holy shit, man. I... I am so sorry.

15:58.187 --> 15:59.619
How could I? I'm so sorry.

15:59.620 --> 16:01.272
- It's my fault.
- I didn't even think about you.

16:01.273 --> 16:02.819
- It's my fault.
- I'm so sorry!

16:02.820 --> 16:04.859
I'm sorry. I'm fuckin' sorry.

16:04.860 --> 16:06.699
Come here.

16:08.700 --> 16:09.989
I'm sorry.

16:09.990 --> 16:11.260
Hey, um...

16:12.480 --> 16:14.530
What'd you guys do to each other?

16:14.536 --> 16:15.569
What is it, Ike?

16:15.570 --> 16:17.079
Uh, W-Wolf's ready for us,

16:17.080 --> 16:19.239
but... but just work this out.

16:19.240 --> 16:21.639
I mean, you got time. I'm so sorry.

16:21.640 --> 16:24.040
I shouldn't have barged
in... Sorry. I'm sorry.

16:25.380 --> 16:27.280
- All right, come on. Let's go.
- All right.

16:29.885 --> 16:30.959
Oh, Chief, good.

16:30.960 --> 16:32.199
Wolf, hey, listen,

16:32.200 --> 16:33.859
the Captain has something
he'd like to say to you.

16:33.860 --> 16:35.059
Well, I have something to say to you.

16:35.060 --> 16:36.307
It's time for the agility test.

16:36.308 --> 16:37.719
Cool. Cap, go ahead.

16:37.720 --> 16:39.400
Line it up.

16:39.410 --> 16:41.399
Oh, you know what? Pretend I'm not here.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.599
- Go ahead.
- No, you, line it up.

16:43.600 --> 16:44.690
You're doing it, too.

16:44.691 --> 16:48.027
Uh, I'm the Chief.

16:48.028 --> 16:50.539
And I need to certify everyone, m'kay?

16:50.540 --> 16:52.669
Now, I've let you slide... no more.

16:54.785 --> 16:57.679
Listen, Wolf, uh, I have a
sensitivity compliance report

16:57.680 --> 16:59.209
I need to file with the
Commissioner's office

16:59.210 --> 17:00.359
by EOD, so...

17:00.360 --> 17:03.820
Ooh, EOD, mmm, you must be a BFD.

17:04.819 --> 17:06.019
Well, I tell you what.

17:06.020 --> 17:08.519
You're not gonna have a lot
of time to fill out forms

17:08.520 --> 17:10.779
when you're spending a
month in my boot camp,

17:10.780 --> 17:12.460
AKA Campo de Lobo.

17:12.470 --> 17:15.579
Mm? That is, unless you think...

17:18.170 --> 17:20.560
maybe you can't pass the test.

17:25.270 --> 17:26.599
You ready for this, Chief?

17:27.619 --> 17:28.809
Hold on.

17:31.000 --> 17:32.249
What is this?

17:32.250 --> 17:33.779
Oh, geez. Okay.

17:33.780 --> 17:36.239
Dense baby dummy. 50 pounds.

17:36.240 --> 17:38.899
Carry it up the stairs
for training purposes.

17:38.900 --> 17:40.496
You got 30 seconds to get up there,

17:40.497 --> 17:42.319
ring that bell, and get back down.

17:42.320 --> 17:43.659
- And go!
- You got it, Chief.

17:57.810 --> 17:58.819
Oh!

17:58.820 --> 18:00.890
Not too bad... 45 seconds.

18:00.900 --> 18:02.279
I guess we'll have to go again.

18:02.280 --> 18:03.609
And go!

18:03.610 --> 18:05.719
- Yay, let's go, Chief!
- Come on! Whoo!

18:05.720 --> 18:07.679
Come on, Chief!

18:13.363 --> 18:16.419
- Oh, 40 seconds.
- All right!

18:16.420 --> 18:18.229
You're getting closer.

18:18.230 --> 18:19.919
Tell you what. I'll give
you one more chance.

18:19.920 --> 18:21.120
And go!

18:26.240 --> 18:28.336
Aww,

18:28.337 --> 18:29.879
50 seconds.

18:29.880 --> 18:32.259
Someone's going the wrong direction.

18:32.260 --> 18:34.279
Tell you what. I'll let
you catch your breath,

18:34.280 --> 18:38.399
and then I'm gonna give
you one more chance.

18:42.060 --> 18:43.719
All right, so I should I apologize now?

18:43.720 --> 18:46.139
How you want me to do it?
Like, I'm really sorry.

18:46.140 --> 18:47.320
I'm so sorry.

18:48.360 --> 18:50.050
- Fuck this guy.
- Yeah!

18:52.440 --> 18:54.529
Now, listen!

18:54.530 --> 18:56.129
Take the ladder out of
the back of the truck,

18:56.130 --> 18:58.991
put it against the wall, climb
to the top in 20 seconds.

18:58.992 --> 19:00.259
Piece of cake, right?

19:00.260 --> 19:02.539
Well, let me tell you one
of my own little ladder

19:02.540 --> 19:04.009
experience stories, okay?

19:04.010 --> 19:05.139
Back in 2006,

19:05.140 --> 19:06.899
we had the Milton Street
fires. Remember that?

19:06.900 --> 19:08.409
My truck was the first one on the scene,

19:08.410 --> 19:10.149
of course, so what do I do?

19:10.150 --> 19:11.609
I scale the aerial, right?

19:11.610 --> 19:12.739
Get a view of the fourth floor.

19:12.740 --> 19:15.019
There I see a woman
with not one, not two,

19:15.020 --> 19:17.579
not three, maybe four babies,
all of them infants.

19:17.580 --> 19:19.540
She was breastfeeding. It was crazy.

19:19.550 --> 19:21.889
Hey, wh... what... who's doing that?

19:21.890 --> 19:23.160
Hey!

19:23.180 --> 19:27.080
Hey, hey... Hey, who's doing that?

19:27.090 --> 19:28.499
McConky, okay.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.981
M-McConky, let me down! Let me down!

19:30.982 --> 19:33.818
A firefighter has to be ready
for anything, right, Wolf?

19:33.819 --> 19:35.528
Shut up, McConky. I'm afraid of heights.

19:35.529 --> 19:37.612
I remember that from the Academy.

19:37.613 --> 19:38.799
Put me down right now, you...

19:38.800 --> 19:40.179
you shit pussy fuck grabbing

19:40.180 --> 19:41.579
leather scratching motherfucker!

19:41.580 --> 19:43.536
McConky! Let me down!

19:43.537 --> 19:45.659
He's crying like a little girl!

19:45.660 --> 19:48.519
I mean, like a genderless creature.

19:48.520 --> 19:50.540
He's crying like a genderless creature.

19:50.544 --> 19:52.589
Where's your dense baby now, Wolf?

19:52.590 --> 19:54.400
Fail, fail, fail!

19:54.410 --> 19:55.798
I'm calling Linda Price!

19:55.799 --> 19:57.259
I can't hear him up there.
What's he saying?

19:57.260 --> 19:59.883
I think he's saying no one's
gonna win the Fart Jar.

19:59.884 --> 20:02.700
I'll see you motherfuckers
at Campo de Lobo!

20:02.710 --> 20:05.279
McConky! Let me down!

20:05.280 --> 20:06.960
Eddie can't control himself.

20:06.970 --> 20:08.436
Eddie doesn't suffer fools.

20:08.437 --> 20:09.729
Eddie's a loose cannon.

20:09.730 --> 20:11.981
I don't know what happened.
Something just came over me.

20:11.982 --> 20:13.239
Yeah, well, from now on,

20:13.240 --> 20:15.359
I should be allowed
unlimited wise-assery.

20:15.360 --> 20:17.360
You're right. You are right.

20:17.370 --> 20:19.280
You know what? Hey, a firefighter

20:19.281 --> 20:20.364
does not behave like that.

20:20.365 --> 20:22.575
Now we have to spend a
month with that jack hole.

20:22.576 --> 20:24.689
Honestly, I am sorry.

20:24.690 --> 20:26.200
Wait a second. That was a good one.

20:26.210 --> 20:28.019
- I believe that "I'm sorry."
- I meant it.

20:28.020 --> 20:29.219
I got to tell you, it was pretty funny

20:29.220 --> 20:30.540
seeing that guy up on
the ladder though, huh?

20:30.550 --> 20:32.668
I know. A firefighter
that's afraid of heights?

20:32.669 --> 20:33.829
Whaaat?

20:41.560 --> 20:44.096
- Yeah...
- Oh, man.

20:48.180 --> 20:51.020
Well, I'm gonna go file
that sensitivity report.

20:51.021 --> 20:53.449
Camp with that asshole's gonna suck!

20:53.450 --> 20:56.180
Well, my other job takes
up all my free time.

20:56.190 --> 20:57.540
Don't know what I'm gonna tell them.

20:57.560 --> 20:58.719
MVA...

20:58.720 --> 20:59.990
Rome and Anderson Street.

21:00.000 --> 21:02.570
Engine 24 rescue. Medical
personnel required.

21:02.574 --> 21:04.094
Right around the corner. Let's hit it.

21:10.930 --> 21:12.260
Holy shit, it's Wolf!

21:12.270 --> 21:13.339
Hey, do you know your name?

21:13.340 --> 21:16.459
W-Wolfgang Harold Boykins III.

21:16.460 --> 21:18.599
- Do you know where you are?
- In the Wolf-mobile.

21:18.600 --> 21:20.591
Hold on, he's doing it
again. It's another ruse.

21:20.592 --> 21:21.899
I don't think so, Cap.

21:21.900 --> 21:24.011
He's crying Wolf, literally.

21:25.722 --> 21:26.729
Cap, he's hurt.

21:26.730 --> 21:30.976
So v-v-very c-c-cold.

21:30.977 --> 21:33.619
Oh, I got the AC on.

21:33.620 --> 21:35.040
Check the blood. It's fake.

21:35.050 --> 21:36.941
Dude, he has a pole
going through his body.

21:36.942 --> 21:39.861
Come on. Oops, no, okay,
that's real blood.

21:39.862 --> 21:41.679
Ike, call an ambulance.

21:41.680 --> 21:43.029
Uh, we need an ambulance on site.

21:43.030 --> 21:45.574
Victim has a fence pole...
err, uh, a fence...

21:45.575 --> 21:46.700
a... a fence supportive device.

21:46.701 --> 21:48.994
Don't report me to FOOFA,
okay? I'm trying to work here.

21:48.995 --> 21:50.569
Cut the shit and just say it, Ike.

21:50.570 --> 21:51.779
I made FOOFA up.

21:51.780 --> 21:53.979
Victim has double-penetration
from a stiff pole,

21:53.980 --> 21:55.839
causing a deep gash
and heavy blood flow.

21:55.840 --> 21:57.280
There, I said it.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.630
I can't believe you made that up!

21:59.631 --> 22:01.639
If I don't make it, Granny,

22:01.640 --> 22:03.959
I want you to have my
Barry Manilow records.

22:03.960 --> 22:04.969
Fuck.

22:04.970 --> 22:07.219
Maybe this is just the morphine talking,

22:07.220 --> 22:10.140
but consider yourselves all passed.

22:10.141 --> 22:12.183
- You get that?
- Oh, yeah, Cap.

22:12.184 --> 22:15.239
Young McConky here is the
number-one trainee today.

22:15.240 --> 22:16.540
- What?!
- You get that?

22:16.570 --> 22:19.483
You know, you kind of remind me
of a young me when I was me.

22:20.986 --> 22:23.069
You know, it's funny.
When I was a rookie,

22:23.070 --> 22:27.209
we got a call to the zoo about
a lion that had escaped,

22:27.210 --> 22:31.059
and... and the lion had purple
wings and braided hair...

22:31.060 --> 22:32.879
Hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.

22:32.880 --> 22:34.540
Hey, Wolfie, no hard feelings, okay?

22:34.550 --> 22:36.219
I just wanted to say,

22:36.220 --> 22:38.010
this pole's a real nice fit on you.

22:38.020 --> 22:39.540
You look like an asshole Popsicle.

22:41.360 --> 22:42.419
Okay.

22:42.420 --> 22:44.592
I have to get the last word in.

22:44.593 --> 22:45.919
What'd you say to him?

22:45.920 --> 22:46.939
I told him I was really sorry.

22:46.940 --> 22:49.220
Good for you, Eddie. Good for you.

22:49.980 --> 22:51.719
- Come on.
- Looks like those Fart Jars

22:51.720 --> 22:52.739
are mine, fellas.

22:52.740 --> 22:54.779
Well, I know somebody that's
buying us drinks tonight.

22:54.780 --> 22:57.260
Deal, and I know just the perfect place.

22:57.270 --> 22:58.279
Ah!

22:58.280 --> 23:00.879
Well, I know how much you
guys love strip clubs,

23:00.880 --> 23:03.694
so the least I could do
is buy you a drink here.

23:03.695 --> 23:05.379
This is super inappropriate.

23:05.380 --> 23:06.655
Yeah, way over the line.

23:07.670 --> 23:10.119
Ladies and gentlemen...

23:10.120 --> 23:12.659
please welcome to the stage...

23:14.580 --> 23:17.082
Crystal Hose!

23:18.930 --> 23:20.260
Yes!

23:24.530 --> 23:27.176
Here he comes!

23:27.177 --> 23:28.539
- Oh, boy.
- What's up, guys?

23:28.540 --> 23:30.635
- What's up, dude?
- Hey, buddy.

23:30.636 --> 23:31.659
Kitchen closes at 10:00,

23:31.660 --> 23:33.509
but I'll tell Fernando if
you want something, okay?

23:33.510 --> 23:35.579
- Really?
- Yeah. I'll be about 20 minutes.

23:35.580 --> 23:36.739
Whoo!

23:40.350 --> 23:43.279
Yeah! I've never been so proud of you.

23:43.280 --> 23:44.289
Thanks, Lucy.

23:44.290 --> 23:46.139
Whoo! Man, it's kind of awesome knowing

23:46.140 --> 23:47.600
where Ike gets all his singles from.

23:48.890 --> 23:51.075
Wait, you guys have never
seen Ike dance here before?

23:51.076 --> 23:52.899
- Why would we?
- Because he's your friend.

23:52.900 --> 23:55.039
Dude, I don't go to
Andy's Carpet Land job

23:55.040 --> 23:56.279
to go see him.

23:56.280 --> 23:58.099
You're welcome anytime, though.

23:58.100 --> 23:59.667
All you guys are.

24:04.240 --> 24:06.909
Give the people what they want!

24:06.910 --> 24:08.139
Whoo!

24:08.140 --> 24:10.579
Hey, behave yourself. Lucy, sit down.

24:10.580 --> 24:12.400
Oh, it's fun. He thinks it's fun!

24:12.410 --> 24:14.519
Wait, what was that? That's kind of a...

24:14.520 --> 24:16.850
Oh, hey, hey! Put me down!

24:16.851 --> 24:18.519
I am a firefighter! Hey!

24:18.520 --> 24:19.699
Dad! Put...

24:19.700 --> 24:20.839
- Put me down!
- You gonna do something about that?

24:20.840 --> 24:21.989
Hey, let go of me!

24:21.990 --> 24:24.589
Hey, four more purple knobs, please.

24:24.590 --> 24:26.329
- Aww, thanks, Chief.
- Yeah.

24:26.330 --> 24:28.195
Put me down!

24:28.196 --> 24:31.200
Hey, that's my helmet!
