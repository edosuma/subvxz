09:53.890 --> 09:55.915
We have _a warrant
to look at hIs computer.

09:55.960 --> 09:57.382
It's about time
someone dId.

09:57.430 --> 09:58.783
PARK: Do you know
what we're looking for?

09:58.830 --> 10:02.095
All day, all night,
all he does is stare
at a screen.

10:02.130 --> 10:03.893
Computer, phone.

10:03.930 --> 10:05.397
You want to look
at that, too?

10:05.430 --> 10:06.988
I'm sorry. We don't have
a warrant for that.

10:07.040 --> 10:08.928
To look at the phone
that I pay for?

10:08.970 --> 10:10.528
Oh, you want a warrant?
Here's your warrant.

10:10.570 --> 10:12.902
Take it. Hand to God,
you're doing me a favor.

10:12.940 --> 10:15.272
Mom, what are you doing?
It's the porno, isn't it?

10:15.310 --> 10:16.777
Ma!
Look, Holly Alter...

10:16.810 --> 10:18.539
She lives next door.
Lovely girl.

10:18.580 --> 10:20.878
A little hippy,
but still, a delight,

10:20.920 --> 10:22.410
but does Hugh Hefner
give her the time of day?

10:22.450 --> 10:24.714
We'd like to
ask you about
Michael Alexander.

10:26.990 --> 10:28.059
Never heard of him.

10:28.090 --> 10:29.284
Yeah, well, he's dead.

10:30.230 --> 10:32.289
**

10:48.440 --> 10:50.476
You disappoint me,
Francesca.

10:50.510 --> 10:52.740
I hired you
to betray Reddington.

10:52.780 --> 10:54.839
Instead, you betrayed me.

10:54.880 --> 10:56.472
You gained his
confidence.

10:56.520 --> 11:00.286
As a result, you now have
a chance to regain mine.

11:00.320 --> 11:02.823
I have a job for you.

11:02.860 --> 11:04.555
I strongly suggest
you take it,

11:04.590 --> 11:07.491
as I will most certainly
kill you if you don't.

11:07.530 --> 11:10.226
**

11:10.270 --> 11:13.159
BALDWIN: An associate of
Reddington's has indicated
a willingness to turn.

11:14.670 --> 11:15.659
It may be a trap.

11:16.770 --> 11:17.805
Which is why
we're sending you.

11:20.110 --> 11:22.908
The who, where, and when
are in this envelope.

11:22.950 --> 11:25.441
Get him.
Bring him here.

11:25.480 --> 11:28.176
**

11:32.520 --> 11:34.818
RESSLER: We looked through
this kid's computer.
He's not involved.

11:34.860 --> 11:37.351
But the video of
Michael_Alexander
was on hIs computer.

11:37.390 --> 11:39.529
Because the computer
was infected by a root-kit.

11:39.560 --> 11:40.697
It was turned
into a zombie-bot...

11:40.730 --> 11:41.719
We know what
a root-kit does.

11:43.670 --> 11:45.297
**

11:45.330 --> 11:46.399
Please go on.

11:47.300 --> 11:49.097
It was being used
as a way station

11:49.140 --> 11:51.529
to mask video uploads,
as well as financial
transactIons

11:51.570 --> 11:52.878
I'm in the process
of tracing.

11:52.910 --> 11:54.537
Let us know
when you find something.

11:54.580 --> 11:56.377
And, Agent Park,
good work.

12:02.180 --> 12:04.148
Look, I get it.

12:04.190 --> 12:06.010
I hope so,
'cause it's obvious.

12:06.050 --> 12:07.711
What's obvious is that you're
not giving her a chance.

12:08.660 --> 12:10.150
I mean,
her joining the team

12:10.190 --> 12:11.384
doesn't_ mean
she's replaCIng Samar.

12:11.430 --> 12:12.727
You know
that's not possible.

12:12.760 --> 12:14.022
Is that what you think
this is about?

12:14.060 --> 12:16.699
Because it doesn't feel like
she's replaCIng Samar.

12:16.730 --> 12:18.618
It feels like
she's here to replace me.

12:18.670 --> 12:20.991
And by the way,
I'm seeing Elodie now

12:21.040 --> 12:23.031
and very, very happy
about it.

12:23.070 --> 12:25.538
Sure, there... There are
a couple of obstacles.

12:25.570 --> 12:27.777
Like her husband,
his wheelchair.

12:27.810 --> 12:29.072
Okay, you know what?

12:29.110 --> 12:30.543
Right now, we are
living in the moment

12:30.580 --> 12:33.515
and having
a great time
doing it.

12:33.550 --> 12:36.041
In fact, I am supposed
to meet her for lunch,

12:36.080 --> 12:38.844
and since you all
have such confidence

12:38.890 --> 12:41.108
in Agent
Perfect-In-Every-Way,

12:42.860 --> 12:43.849
that is what
I'm going to go do.

12:45.960 --> 12:47.393
**

12:47.430 --> 12:52.026
Trust is so fragile.

12:53.200 --> 12:57.000
When it exists,
anything is possible,

12:57.040 --> 12:59.804
between people
or nations.

12:59.840 --> 13:01.307
But when it doesn't,
or worse,

13:02.210 --> 13:05.941
when_a bond of trust
Is broken,

13:05.980 --> 13:07.811
there is
no greater betrayal.

13:09.920 --> 13:10.909
Cigar?

13:11.750 --> 13:13.012
Excuse me?

13:13.060 --> 13:15.278
Well, not down
to the stub or anything.

13:15.320 --> 13:16.753
Want to keep
the lungs clear,

13:16.790 --> 13:18.826
but a celebratory puff
or two can't hurt.

13:20.600 --> 13:21.726
What are we
celebratIng?

13:22.300 --> 13:23.392
Your new job.

13:24.170 --> 13:25.467
On the Task Force.

13:25.500 --> 13:27.434
The FBI Task Force.

13:27.470 --> 13:29.961
As my life
often depends on it,

13:30.010 --> 13:33.434
I have become an astute
judge of character.

13:38.650 --> 13:40.277
And in our short
tIme together,

13:41.780 --> 13:45.409
I have come to judge you
as trustworthy.

13:45.450 --> 13:47.111
I appreciate that.

13:47.160 --> 13:49.981
(CLEARs THROAT)

13:50.030 --> 13:51.486
And the job.

13:51.530 --> 13:54.727
_ I'm at war
WIth a worthy adversary.

13:54.760 --> 13:57.627
Someone capable
of exploiting

13:57.670 --> 13:59.991
even those
closest to me.

14:01.000 --> 14:03.730
I need you to keep an eye
on an associate

14:03.770 --> 14:05.863
who I believe
is about to betray me.

14:10.850 --> 14:13.068
Picked these up
in Havana last week

14:13.120 --> 14:14.815
from Castro's
personal humIdor.

14:16.520 --> 14:18.078
Communism may be
discredited,

14:18.120 --> 14:20.884
but it still produces
a damn fine cigar.

14:22.360 --> 14:24.920
**

14:24.960 --> 14:27.190
When you said there was this
amazing place to have lunch,

14:27.230 --> 14:29.596
I assumed you meant
an amazing restaurant.

14:29.630 --> 14:30.619
This is way better.

14:31.170 --> 14:32.592
This is someone's house.

14:32.630 --> 14:35.758
It's a replica
of Donato Bramante's
TempIetto.

14:35.800 --> 14:37.700
They should be
giving tours.

14:37.740 --> 14:38.934
Someone lives here.

14:38.970 --> 14:40.801
I know.
But they're at work.

15:12.840 --> 15:14.831

15:14.880 --> 15:16.404
What am I doing?

15:25.620 --> 15:27.679
I, um...

This is not
gonna end well.

15:52.250 --> 15:54.070
This is crazy.

Knock, knock.

16:01.890 --> 16:03.084
It feels_
so wrong, rIght?

16:04.290 --> 16:05.723
I definitely
feel something.

16:09.500 --> 16:10.592
Show me.

16:12.570 --> 16:13.798
You're gonna be
the death of me.

16:15.170 --> 16:16.398
Wouldn't that be amazing?

16:25.250 --> 16:26.649
Hey, it's me.
Got a minute?

16:26.680 --> 16:29.148
Might I call you back
in, say, 20 minutes?

16:29.180 --> 16:31.444
Or you know what?
Make it 30.

16:31.490 --> 16:32.718
Why? Where are you?

16:32.750 --> 16:35.651
Dembe and I
are just wrappIng up

16:35.690 --> 16:40.627
an absolutely delicious
and long overdue
lunch date with Brimley.

16:40.660 --> 16:43.788
He's made his mother's
apple brown betty,

16:43.830 --> 16:45.764
and turns out the sweetness

16:45.800 --> 16:48.337
doesn't really come
from the sugar at all

16:48.370 --> 16:52.238
but from the Ribston Pippin
apples themselves.

16:52.270 --> 16:55.137
Also known
as the Glory of York!

16:55.180 --> 16:56.829
(CHUCKLES)
(CHUCKLING) Okay.

16:56.880 --> 16:58.279
That's great,

16:58.310 --> 17:00.517
but the apple brown betty
is gonna have to wait.

17:00.550 --> 17:03.439
I spoke to Park.
She has a lead.

17:03.490 --> 17:07.415
Mm. It's very winning,
the way you're promoting
Agent Park.

17:07.460 --> 17:11.021
She said the computer used
to upload the deepfake

17:11.060 --> 17:12.721
also made _
another transactIon.

17:12.760 --> 17:14.022
Another video?

17:14.060 --> 17:15.129
Nope, money.

17:15.160 --> 17:17.424
$70,000 to be exact.

17:17.470 --> 17:18.767

an alias.

17:21.200 --> 17:23.964
Total dead end.
But we got an image of him

17:24.010 --> 17:26.035
on the CCTVs
withdrawing the payment.

17:26.070 --> 17:27.378
Park is releasing it
on the wire,

17:27.410 --> 17:29.833
but I want you
to take a look.

17:29.880 --> 17:31.142
Thought maybe
you'd know the face.

17:31.180 --> 17:33.512
Oh, happy to look.
Send it to Dembe.

17:33.550 --> 17:36.644
We'll turn over a few rocks.
I'll call you back posthaste.

Oh, my goodness.

17:37.890 --> 17:39.380
Where's the ice cream?

17:39.420 --> 17:40.887
No ice cream.

17:40.920 --> 17:42.387
What do you mean,
no ice cream?

17:42.420 --> 17:46.129

with heavy cream.

I thought the conditions
were perfect the last time

21:03.020 --> 21:07.150

flawlessly.
But it'll get done.

be asking the questions.

21:33.090 --> 21:36.719

he has a lead.

this to work.

22:01.650 --> 22:02.878
And in order
for that to happen,

22:02.920 --> 22:05.445
you have to try
to make a good impression.

I already got the job.

22:07.150 --> 22:08.788

22:09.760 --> 22:10.829

that he has the final say?

22:13.360 --> 22:15.794
That I'm being vetted
by the most wanted man
in America?

22:15.830 --> 22:18.822
I vetted you, and I think
you're the right person
for the job.

Raymond Reddington.

have possibly done

references,

22:34.380 --> 22:36.314
yet you recommended me
for the job

22:36.350 --> 22:38.284
because of what
you don't know about me?

22:39.690 --> 22:41.317
You have a secret.

22:41.360 --> 22:43.521
That tells me a lot more
about you than your GPA.

22:44.630 --> 22:45.858
I'm not gonna tell you
what it is.

okay?

23:02.340 --> 23:04.479
Right. No...
All right, fine.

You must be Agent Park.

No, I didn't,
but I caused it to rupture.

23:18.090 --> 23:20.388
It was my fault.
Did you kill Higgins?

23:20.430 --> 23:22.796

We didn't even hit 30 PSI.

23:27.170 --> 23:29.695
Evidently, your source
had an ulcer

23:29.740 --> 23:33.232
that ruptured as a result
of undue stress.

who was supposed to make
a good impression?

23:56.860 --> 23:58.589
Higgins was a hitman.

23:58.630 --> 24:00.860
He said he was paid
through a numbered account

24:00.900 --> 24:05.234
to assassinate an Almacorp
scientist in Arlington

24:05.270 --> 24:08.103

You wanted her
to see all this.

24:10.040 --> 24:11.746
No, I...

24:11.780 --> 24:14.340
But you did say there was
a darkness about her.

24:14.380 --> 24:15.916
If one were
to wonder how dark,

24:15.950 --> 24:18.282

would be not very.

named Tracy Long.

Yes.

24:30.830 --> 24:32.923
By whom?
We don't know.

24:32.970 --> 24:34.130
You said you caught
the assassin.

I said we gathered
intel from him.

And now he's dead,

died with him.

24:40.610 --> 24:42.805
But what we do know,
Dr. Long,

24:42.840 --> 24:45.070
is that you're not
the only one with
a target on your back.

24:45.110 --> 24:48.273
We believe Michael Alexander
was targeted, as well.

24:48.320 --> 24:50.709
But the video, the...
The things he said...

24:50.750 --> 24:52.217
RESSLER: He didn't say them.

24:52.250 --> 24:54.514
The video was doctored
to make him look like
a threat.

24:55.790 --> 24:57.826

in Arlington this morning?

24:59.090 --> 25:01.149
Yes, with
Dr. Lewis Powell.

25:02.360 --> 25:04.169
Why?
Tell us about him.

25:04.200 --> 25:07.169
He's a pioneer
in our field.

25:07.200 --> 25:09.134
His research into
neural networks

25:09.170 --> 25:11.468
is the foundation
of modern A.I.

25:11.510 --> 25:13.068
Now, what did you two
talk about?

25:13.110 --> 25:14.839
N-Nothing.
He didn't show up.

25:16.040 --> 25:17.507
I didn't think anything
about that.

25:17.550 --> 25:19.245
He has ALS.

25:19.280 --> 25:20.872
His health can be
unpredictable.

25:20.920 --> 25:22.774
The reason I'm asking
is because we believe

25:22.820 --> 25:25.539
the attempt on your life was
meant to happen in Arlington.

25:25.590 --> 25:27.114
We need to get in touch
with Powell.

25:27.150 --> 25:29.482
If you and Dr. Alexander
were targeted,

25:29.520 --> 25:31.522
it's possible he was, too.

and FleetAI?

26:45.530 --> 26:46.895

26:46.930 --> 26:48.898
Because he loves coming over

Not yet.

to the rise of machines,

is very little.
