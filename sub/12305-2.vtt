WEBVTT

00:15.659 --> 00:18.162
Candace,your iced
caramel macchiato is up.

00:28.172 --> 00:29.465
Paris, France

00:46.899 --> 00:48.734
Mumbai, India

00:58.994 --> 01:00.955
Tokyo, Japan

01:28.691 --> 01:31.026
Swimmers,take your marks!

01:33.070 --> 01:34.863
Go.

02:28.042 --> 02:29.168
I love you,baby.

02:47.478 --> 02:49.355
Go get 'em,candace.

02:55.402 --> 02:57.655
Swimmers,take your marks!

03:15.506 --> 03:16.548
Luke?

03:21.595 --> 03:23.055
Luke

03:34.108 --> 03:35.567
Alexx?

03:35.609 --> 03:37.152
Meet luke selyan.

03:37.194 --> 03:40.990
Just started his senior
year at coral grove high.

03:41.240 --> 03:44.243
A parent shouldn't
have to go through this,

03:44.285 --> 03:46.370
and you shouldn't have had to either.

03:46.453 --> 03:48.205
Any witnesses,frank?

03:48.247 --> 03:52.251
I haven't got a single
eyewitness that,uh,saw the archer.

03:52.293 --> 03:54.295
Found out the school has
an archery team,though.

03:54.336 --> 03:56.547
Let's check into the team then.

03:56.588 --> 03:57.673
Yeah.

03:57.965 --> 03:59.425
Over there is candace walker.

03:59.466 --> 04:00.843
She's the vic's girlfriend.

04:00.884 --> 04:03.595
She's the reason for
all these extra eyeballs.

04:03.637 --> 04:05.222
Thank you,alexx.

04:10.936 --> 04:12.396
Candace.

04:14.815 --> 04:16.524
You hanging in there?

04:17.483 --> 04:18.986
I guess.

04:19.028 --> 04:22.489
I understand that luke
was your boyfriend.

04:23.741 --> 04:26.660
Who do you think might want to hurt him?

04:28.078 --> 04:29.830
Everyone.

04:30.664 --> 04:34.335
Ever since that picture of me
turned up online last month,

04:34.376 --> 04:37.421
people have been following us,e
- mailing,

04:37.463 --> 04:40.466
wanting to know every
little detail about me.

04:40.591 --> 04:44.887
Yes,and they probably are not
comfortable with you having a boyfriend.

04:46.972 --> 04:49.016
I'm going to tell you what,candace.

04:49.058 --> 04:51.685
I'm gonna find out who did this. okay?

04:52.478 --> 04:53.646
Lieutenant.

04:53.687 --> 04:55.064
You hang in there.

04:55.147 --> 04:56.231
Yeah.

04:58.651 --> 05:00.361
I'm candace's father.

05:00.402 --> 05:01.403
Mr. Walker.

05:01.445 --> 05:02.905
We have been followed all weekend.

05:02.947 --> 05:06.325
These cyber-stalkers,these
so-called fans,

05:06.742 --> 05:09.578
and because of them,luke is dead.

05:09.954 --> 05:11.538
What if my daughter's next?

05:11.580 --> 05:12.915
Mr. Walker?

05:13.248 --> 05:15.709
That is not gonna happen.

06:09.014 --> 06:10.181
Hey,candace! Over here!

06:10.223 --> 06:11.308
Can i get your autograph?

06:11.349 --> 06:13.518
Hey,i'm so sorry about what
happened to your boyfriend.

06:13.560 --> 06:16.062
Candace,are you afraid
you might be next?

06:16.104 --> 06:17.397
Who do you think is responsible?

06:17.439 --> 06:18.523
Candace!

06:30.160 --> 06:32.120
We're gonna send you home,candace.

06:32.162 --> 06:34.080
You'll be safe there,all right?

06:38.710 --> 06:40.420
candace! Please!

06:43.757 --> 06:45.425
- Mr. Wolfe.
- Thanks for calling.

06:45.467 --> 06:47.719
I tried to get here as quick as i could.

06:47.761 --> 06:49.346
Is everything,um...

06:51.014 --> 06:52.891
Is this about the reinstatement?

06:53.016 --> 06:54.935
It's a step in that direction.

06:54.976 --> 06:57.270
Okay,great,because the,uh...

06:57.312 --> 06:59.564
The gun range isn't really paying the...

06:59.606 --> 07:02.567
I understand. This
is private protection.

07:02.859 --> 07:04.527
Private protection?

07:04.861 --> 07:06.071
Great. Great.

07:06.112 --> 07:06.947
I'll,uh,i'll take it.

07:06.988 --> 07:08.615
What's the... Who's the client?

07:08.657 --> 07:10.158
The young lady that just left here.

07:10.200 --> 07:12.410
Candace walker is the client.

07:12.452 --> 07:13.703
The girl from the internet.

07:13.745 --> 07:14.621
Yeah.

07:14.663 --> 07:18.833
um... Heh. Can her family
afford private protection?

07:18.875 --> 07:21.419
It's already been taken care of.

07:23.171 --> 07:25.465
Listen,i really,uh...

07:26.633 --> 07:27.968
I appreciate this.

07:28.009 --> 07:29.094
I know you do,Mr. Wolfe.

07:29.135 --> 07:30.845
This girl is in serious danger.

07:30.887 --> 07:32.514
Be careful.

07:33.181 --> 07:34.474
You got it.

07:34.683 --> 07:35.725
All right.

07:42.607 --> 07:45.318
How many students are on
the archery team,Mr. Whitten?

07:45.360 --> 07:46.486
Nine boys.

07:46.528 --> 07:47.654
We're regional champs.

07:47.696 --> 07:50.490
And you're the only one with
a key to the equipment room?

07:50.532 --> 07:54.619
As athletic director and coach,yes.

07:56.621 --> 07:58.248
You ever lend the key out?

07:58.331 --> 07:59.916
Put the captain in charge?

08:00.292 --> 08:04.045
Miss duquesne,i recognize this
equipment can be dangerous.

08:04.087 --> 08:05.922
I take that seriously.

08:05.964 --> 08:09.342
As you can see,they're
even locked inside the case.

08:09.384 --> 08:10.677
Do you know if all
the equipment is here?

08:10.719 --> 08:13.305
Can you account for all the bows?

08:13.805 --> 08:14.639
Yeah.

08:14.723 --> 08:15.265
They're all here.

08:15.307 --> 08:18.018
That means somebody put
the murder weapon back.

08:18.059 --> 08:19.894
Or none of these isa murder weapon.

08:19.936 --> 08:22.522
Why don't you letme figure
that out,Mr. Whitten?

08:22.564 --> 08:24.524
I'm gonna need to
collect all the equipment.

08:24.566 --> 08:28.486
I'm gonna need a complete list of the
names of the students on the archery team.

08:33.575 --> 08:36.285
All the students are required to
get a waiver signed to join the team.

08:36.328 --> 08:39.748
I can get you the waivers,and
you can contact them that way.

08:39.789 --> 08:41.457
I appreciate that.

08:45.170 --> 08:48.298
You a fan of candace,Mr. Whitten?

08:48.340 --> 08:52.636
She's always been a special project
of mine since she joined the team.

08:55.639 --> 08:58.475
I always knew she'd go
on to do great things.

08:58.934 --> 08:59.809
I know this might be tough for her,

08:59.851 --> 09:03.521
but all the attention she's
getting is great for the school.

09:03.647 --> 09:05.398
For the sport.

09:17.577 --> 09:18.703
All right,sam.

09:18.745 --> 09:20.413
You know how all this new tech works,

09:20.455 --> 09:24.084
so,let's see this picture of candace
walker that has everyone's attention.

09:24.125 --> 09:26.962
This girl has got some
serious fan worship.

09:27.003 --> 09:28.505
I googled her name.

09:28.546 --> 09:30.548
Over a quarter of a
million hits already.

09:30.590 --> 09:33.593
Seems like she'd have the right
to protect her own likeness.

09:33.635 --> 09:35.345
The laws aren't in her favor.

09:35.387 --> 09:37.806
The internet's still a legal wild west.

09:37.847 --> 09:41.476
It's her likeness,but the
photographer owns the photograph.

09:41.518 --> 09:44.104
This is the shot you're talking about.

09:44.354 --> 09:45.730
You get it?

09:45.772 --> 09:46.523
I get it.

09:46.564 --> 09:49.776
It was taken at her high
school swim meet two weeks ago.

09:49.818 --> 09:52.696
Once it was online,she
went from average nobody...

09:52.737 --> 09:55.991
To worldwide cyber-lebrity overnight.

09:56.783 --> 09:58.576
Anything online from today's meet?

09:58.618 --> 10:00.704
Hundreds of digital shots
from the fans in the crowd,

10:00.745 --> 10:02.998
but nothing on luke's shooter.

10:03.039 --> 10:04.708
They're all focused on candace.

10:04.749 --> 10:07.002
But let me keep digging.
i'll give you a call.

10:07.043 --> 10:08.586
Thanks.

11:23.244 --> 11:25.789
i got a call that you
have a rush sample for dna.

11:25.830 --> 11:26.581
I do.

11:26.623 --> 11:28.959
All of these compound
bows have a launcher.

11:29.000 --> 11:33.213
It's the place where the arrow rests as
you're shooting the bow to keep it stable.

11:33.254 --> 11:34.422
All launchers are different.

11:34.464 --> 11:36.549
Some are felt,some are lined in brushes,

11:36.591 --> 11:38.468
but they're all there
for the same purpose,

11:38.510 --> 11:42.681
which is to counteract the horizontal
movement as you're firing the bow.

11:46.059 --> 11:49.312
This one... Is our murder weapon.

11:49.354 --> 11:54.025
The launcher on it is metal.

11:56.987 --> 12:01.324
So the oscillating movement against
it left very distinct markings.

12:01.366 --> 12:04.703
Like a gun barrel leaving
striations on a fired bullet.

12:04.744 --> 12:05.578
Exactly.

12:05.620 --> 12:08.039
I will jump this to the
front of the line at dna.

12:23.388 --> 12:24.556
Okay.

12:25.473 --> 12:27.809
You ready to see luke's parents?

12:27.934 --> 12:29.853
I wish you could've known him.

12:30.103 --> 12:31.313
Luke.

12:32.689 --> 12:34.316
He was so sweet...

12:35.483 --> 12:37.319
Selfless...

12:39.154 --> 12:40.614
I just...

12:41.197 --> 12:44.492
I can't help but think
that this is all my fault.

12:46.411 --> 12:47.746
Candace...

12:48.371 --> 12:52.584
All of this is out of your control.

12:54.753 --> 12:56.880
You got to rember that,okay?

12:56.921 --> 12:58.256
Let's do this.

13:06.139 --> 13:07.265
Damn it.

13:07.349 --> 13:08.433
What is it?

13:08.475 --> 13:10.393
I thought i shook your
fans with the decoy car,

13:10.435 --> 13:13.104
but they posted our location online.

13:22.322 --> 13:23.615
Out of the way.

13:26.368 --> 13:28.662
Out of the way,out of the way.

13:35.210 --> 13:36.336
over here!

13:37.587 --> 13:39.130
All right,sam,what do you got?

13:39.172 --> 13:40.423
Check this out.

13:41.299 --> 13:42.801
This is creepy.

13:43.843 --> 13:46.012
Latest form of citizen journalism.

13:46.054 --> 13:48.807
Anybody on the streets
with a cell phone or pda

13:48.848 --> 13:51.017
can send their
sightings,photos and video

13:51.059 --> 13:54.020
which can be posted on this
site in nearly real time.

13:54.312 --> 13:56.898
This is the most recent posting.

14:00.777 --> 14:03.822
"Just spotted candace
out with a cute older guy.

14:03.863 --> 14:05.490
Very serious. "

14:06.408 --> 14:07.617
he looks familiar.

14:07.659 --> 14:09.286
Yeah,his name is ryan wolfe.

14:09.327 --> 14:10.370
He used to work here.

14:10.412 --> 14:13.123
Horatio hired him to
be candace's bodyguard.

14:19.337 --> 14:21.381
What about that photograph?

14:24.259 --> 14:26.803
Looks like she's in love
with the photographer.

14:28.513 --> 14:30.807
Look at the hands on her face.

14:31.057 --> 14:34.769
How can you take a picture that
close without holding a camera?

14:34.894 --> 14:36.521
You can't.

14:36.730 --> 14:38.565
Unless you're wearing it.

14:45.238 --> 14:46.281
Hey,alexx.

14:46.323 --> 14:48.116
So,these his personal effects?

14:48.158 --> 14:49.159
Yeah.

14:53.788 --> 14:57.000
Had a $300 pair of
surf-and-skate shades.

14:57.042 --> 15:02.672
Grilamid frames,polarized lenses
and the latest in surveillance tech.

15:03.548 --> 15:05.842
Spy glasses?

15:07.761 --> 15:10.889
He would've needed a transmitter
to get the images out.

15:15.560 --> 15:16.937
Bingo.

15:21.316 --> 15:23.777
Luke wasn't spying on himself.

15:23.818 --> 15:26.196
Poor girl can't trust anyone.

16:08.321 --> 16:10.365
i'm a blogger,lieutenant.

16:10.615 --> 16:13.326
First amendment and all gives
me a right to free speech.

16:13.368 --> 16:17.455
Yes,but it does not include
illegal surveillance.

16:17.872 --> 16:19.499
I wasn't surveilling him.

16:19.541 --> 16:23.420
Look,i planted the bugged sunglasses
on the kid to keep up with candace.

16:23.461 --> 16:25.297
Yes,but now he's dead.

16:25.338 --> 16:27.507
I had nothing to do with that.

16:27.590 --> 16:29.926
I just blog about celebrities.

16:30.010 --> 16:32.304
But you stalk minors as well.

16:32.345 --> 16:34.806
Look,if the world knows
them,they're famous.

16:34.848 --> 16:38.518
The photos and videos i get of
her,it's all just for my blog.

16:38.560 --> 16:41.021
It's not easy making
a buck on the internet.

16:41.062 --> 16:44.107
As she gets more popular,the
competition gets more fierce.

16:44.149 --> 16:45.692
I need an edge.

16:48.528 --> 16:51.072
So i busted into luke's car.

16:57.912 --> 17:02.083
I switched out his
shades for a bugged pair.

17:03.418 --> 17:05.753
That camera got me
shots no one else could.

17:05.795 --> 17:06.755
Yes.

17:06.796 --> 17:08.757
Where were you this morning?

17:09.049 --> 17:12.551
I was off campus,watching the feed.

17:28.484 --> 17:32.322
Look,i had nothing to
do with luke's murder.

17:32.364 --> 17:34.783
But you did stalk candace.

17:35.450 --> 17:38.995
There are a million people
worldwide "stalking" her.

17:39.037 --> 17:44.960
Recording her without her knowledge is a
crime punishable by a five-year prison term.

17:48.088 --> 17:50.090
Five years?

17:51.549 --> 17:53.218
Where's the video?

17:55.136 --> 17:57.889
It's,uh,it's back in my truck.

18:02.894 --> 18:06.064
Thank you for going with
me to see luke's parents.

18:07.524 --> 18:10.068
A couple more posts on stalkwalker. Com.

18:10.110 --> 18:11.569
"See candace's cop. "

18:11.611 --> 18:12.696
i'm sorry.

18:12.904 --> 18:14.322
Yeah,they do that.

18:14.364 --> 18:18.159
Anyone who associates with me
is put under the microscope,too.

18:22.414 --> 18:25.750
Candace,do me a favor,um... Wait inside.

18:25.792 --> 18:27.836
I'll be there in a second,okay?

18:32.424 --> 18:33.633
H.

18:33.717 --> 18:35.427
Is candace safe,Mr. Wolfe?

18:35.468 --> 18:37.429
Yeah,she is,but,uh...

18:38.013 --> 18:41.891
What's happening to her
might be happening to you.

18:42.183 --> 18:44.144
Okay,thank you,Mr. Wolfe.

18:45.437 --> 18:46.980
If this is about wolfe's paycheck...

18:47.022 --> 18:48.773
Wolfe can babysit the girl
all week for all i care.

18:48.815 --> 18:50.483
There's something else going on.

18:50.525 --> 18:52.611
I'm being tracked online.

18:52.652 --> 18:55.739
This girl's fans are investigating you.

18:56.031 --> 18:59.034
And they've uncovered your
involvement in the argento grand jury,

18:59.075 --> 19:02.203
from five years ago,horatio.

19:02.621 --> 19:06.583
Sounds like we may have
a juror seeking attention.

19:06.625 --> 19:08.209
Argento's mob.

19:08.251 --> 19:09.836
Old school.

19:09.919 --> 19:13.590
Now argento knows you're
the one who put him away.

19:13.965 --> 19:15.884
He still has associates
on the outside,horatio.

19:15.926 --> 19:17.636
Somebody might want
to take a shot at you.

19:17.677 --> 19:19.971
I guess that's the risk
we take every day,rick.

19:20.013 --> 19:21.806
This is beyond hero worship,okay?

19:21.848 --> 19:24.059
With this information out
there,you're in danger.

19:24.100 --> 19:27.520
And i would like to convince you to
take on a security detail of your own.

19:27.562 --> 19:30.649
Rick,do i detect a note
of personal concern?

19:30.690 --> 19:33.693
The department is feeling very exposed.

19:33.735 --> 19:36.613
Oh,so we're back to reality.

19:36.821 --> 19:38.615
This is serious,horatio.

19:38.657 --> 19:40.450
It always is.

19:54.549 --> 19:57.010
Call the transpo pool,frank.

19:57.135 --> 19:58.679
They slash all of 'em?

19:58.720 --> 20:00.222
Just these two.

20:00.389 --> 20:01.682
And they busted in.

20:01.723 --> 20:04.726
Yeah,and they got my flat badge,too.

20:04.810 --> 20:07.271
That would explain the call i just got.

20:07.312 --> 20:08.563
B&e in sweetwater.

20:08.605 --> 20:09.773
Arson too.

20:09.815 --> 20:12.192
They found your flat badge on scene.

20:12.442 --> 20:15.404
You think this has anything to do with your
involvement in the argento case going public?

20:15.445 --> 20:19.324
suffice to say,frank,someone
is settling an old score.

20:19.366 --> 20:20.492
I'll meet you there.

20:40.053 --> 20:41.346
Prints?

20:41.471 --> 20:43.390
Nothing we can use.

20:43.432 --> 20:44.975
Frank,take a look around this place.

20:45.017 --> 20:46.768
What do you notice?

20:46.810 --> 20:48.979
You mean beside the obvious plant?

20:49.021 --> 20:51.106
Argento was in arson for the mob.

20:51.148 --> 20:53.317
And quite a source of income,wasn't he?

20:53.358 --> 20:54.067
Yeah.

20:54.109 --> 20:55.152
Fire for hire.

20:55.319 --> 20:57.487
They made millions doing it.

20:57.529 --> 20:59.323
This doesn't look like the
work of a pro,though,does it?

20:59.364 --> 21:00.616
No,it doesn't.

21:00.657 --> 21:02.075
Correct me if i'm wrong.

21:02.117 --> 21:04.161
He had a son.

21:04.369 --> 21:06.246
Matter of fact,he does.

21:06.330 --> 21:08.040
Let's bring him in.

21:13.420 --> 21:15.464
Damon argento.

21:15.547 --> 21:17.007
Yeah,so?

21:17.799 --> 21:22.512
Damon,my name is horatio caine.

21:24.306 --> 21:26.308
You going to tell me
what i'm doing here?

21:26.391 --> 21:34.566
Well,for starters,damon,robbery,arson,destruction
of a police vehicle.

21:35.901 --> 21:37.527
Now,why would i do all that?

21:37.569 --> 21:40.238
Because i put your father in jail,damon.

21:40.322 --> 21:41.573
Five years ago.

21:41.615 --> 21:43.617
So you have something to do with that?

21:46.620 --> 21:51.750
God. Last i heard,the punks who put him away
for the rest of his life hid behind a grand jury.

21:51.792 --> 21:58.423
Damon,i know you're angry,and
i know you want revenge,

21:58.465 --> 22:03.428
but this is a big
mistake,and you have a choice.

22:06.181 --> 22:07.599
Don't worry.

22:07.933 --> 22:09.810
i'll get my revenge.

22:12.187 --> 22:16.566
Now,if you're not going to
charge me with anything,then,um...

22:17.276 --> 22:17.985
I'm out of here.

22:18.026 --> 22:21.989
Son,you've been warned.

22:51.435 --> 22:53.979
What have you got here?

22:59.234 --> 23:02.571
This is creepy,watching the
final moments of luke's life.

23:02.613 --> 23:04.990
Yeah. And from his point of view.

23:05.073 --> 23:06.992
You know,we got a firsthand
record of the murder,

23:07.034 --> 23:09.536
and we don't actually see who did it.

23:13.707 --> 23:15.751
Go back to the beginning,would you,sam?

23:16.376 --> 23:17.711
Take it back to...

23:17.753 --> 23:18.879
right there.

23:19.379 --> 23:21.673
That's the athletic director.

23:24.676 --> 23:26.637
And who's this girl eyeing luke?

23:58.085 --> 24:00.379
Hey,eric,it's alexx.

24:00.420 --> 24:03.465
Just found lipstick
behind our boy's ear.

24:03.674 --> 24:05.884
My guess,it's waterproof.

24:09.429 --> 24:12.224
We found some lipstick on
the back of luke selyan's ear.

24:12.266 --> 24:15.477
It contained a substance
called dimethicone copolyol.

24:15.519 --> 24:18.230
That's what makes your
lipstick waterproof.

24:18.272 --> 24:21.775
I'm not the only one on the team
that wears waterproof makeup.

24:21.817 --> 24:22.526
Well,i tell you what.

24:22.567 --> 24:27.197
after i swab you for dna,we can match
it to the sample from the other lipstick.

24:27.239 --> 24:28.156
Wait.

24:28.198 --> 24:30.993
I... I kissed him,okay?

24:31.994 --> 24:33.662
Next up: 100-meter freestyle.

24:33.704 --> 24:36.164
So when are you going to take me out?

24:36.206 --> 24:38.583
Miranda,you know i'm with candace.

24:38.667 --> 24:41.003
You and i are never going to happen.

24:41.044 --> 24:43.005
You don't mean that.

24:48.176 --> 24:51.555
He was so into me,but
just like everyone else,

24:51.597 --> 24:54.683
candace had him convinced
she was somehow better.

24:54.766 --> 24:59.938
He became a lot more interested in her
after since she became famous or whatever.

24:59.980 --> 25:03.317
Sounds like you were a little
jealous of her popularity.

25:04.067 --> 25:05.611
I'm on the swim team.

25:05.652 --> 25:08.655
I can pretty much have
any guy in school i want.

25:08.697 --> 25:11.658
And the one guy you couldn't
have,he ended up dead.

25:19.124 --> 25:20.751
I got your message.

25:20.876 --> 25:23.295
I ran epithelials from the
bow that killed luke selyan.

25:23.337 --> 25:24.212
And?

25:24.254 --> 25:25.297
A codis hit?

25:25.339 --> 25:26.590
Wouldn't you know it.

25:27.674 --> 25:30.344
I knew i didn't like that coach.

25:31.720 --> 25:36.141
Mr. Whitten,i expected to
find your fingerprints on some,

25:36.183 --> 25:37.726
if not all,of the archery equipment,

25:37.768 --> 25:44.066
but imagine my surprise when i found your dna
on the compound bow that killed luke selyan?

25:48.904 --> 25:49.738
I handle the equipment.

25:49.780 --> 25:52.449
It's pretty easy to nick yourself
when you're working with them.

25:52.491 --> 25:54.868
So you're claiming to
have not used that bow?

25:54.910 --> 25:57.120
I calibrate the bows for the team.

25:57.204 --> 25:58.747
I don't fire them.

26:00.958 --> 26:03.460
Luke was on the football
team,is that correct?

26:03.502 --> 26:04.169
He was.

26:04.211 --> 26:06.004
but you kicked him off.

26:06.046 --> 26:08.215
When his grades began to falter,yes.

26:08.257 --> 26:10.425
So your star swimmer
was dating a distraction.

26:10.467 --> 26:12.219
That's not it at all.

26:12.261 --> 26:15.514
I'd never do anything to hurt candace.

26:16.139 --> 26:20.519
With all of the pictures of candace in
your office,i imagine that that's true.

26:20.560 --> 26:23.146
Maybe you wanted her for yourself.

26:23.772 --> 26:26.233
Luke was a threat,so you killed him.

26:30.237 --> 26:31.863
You're wrong.

26:36.159 --> 26:38.954
Be sure and stay close
to campus,Mr. Whitten.

26:51.800 --> 26:53.927
all right. That's it. Beautiful.

26:53.969 --> 26:55.429
good job,candace.

26:55.470 --> 26:57.014
Chin down. chin down.

26:57.055 --> 26:58.098
To your right. That's it.

26:58.140 --> 27:00.183
give me a little tyra.

27:00.475 --> 27:01.977
Just liked that.

27:09.151 --> 27:12.654
Do you really think this is the best
idea for your daughter right now?

27:13.113 --> 27:14.823
You sound like her father.

27:14.865 --> 27:16.241
He wants no part of this.

27:16.283 --> 27:20.037
He doesn't get that she's
launching a national ad campaign.

27:20.704 --> 27:21.955
This is paying for college.

27:21.997 --> 27:23.832
And who knows how long
this thing will last.

27:23.874 --> 27:27.252
We've got to squeeze every last
drop of it before the crowd moves on.

27:27.294 --> 27:29.755
Don't you care at all about
your daughter's safety?

27:29.796 --> 27:31.590
That's ur job.

27:43.393 --> 27:46.271
One more,candace. all right, that's it

27:48.231 --> 27:49.816
Great work,candace.

27:49.900 --> 27:51.276
Stay gorgeous.

27:52.569 --> 27:53.695
thanks

27:56.281 --> 27:57.616
Is everything okay?

27:57.658 --> 27:59.618
Okay? you looked amazing out there.

27:59.660 --> 28:03.121
Actually,uh,stalkwalker. Com
posted a tip that we're here,

28:03.163 --> 28:04.915
so there's going to be
people camped out front.

28:04.957 --> 28:06.875
We're going to leave out the back.

28:06.917 --> 28:08.585
Could you grab the town car and meet us?

28:08.627 --> 28:10.504
Soon as i get the gift basket.

28:12.297 --> 28:13.757
Ryan,am i okay?

28:13.799 --> 28:15.634
Oh,yeah,everything's going to be fine.

28:15.676 --> 28:16.718
Come on.

28:31.142 --> 28:32.227
Got it.

28:38.566 --> 28:40.318
Lieutenant Caine?

28:40.360 --> 28:42.070
Yes. Miss barrish?

28:42.487 --> 28:43.989
It's about your stalker map.

28:44.030 --> 28:45.782
I saw this in the chat forum.

28:45.824 --> 28:48.410
It's easy to post something
like this anonymously,

28:48.451 --> 28:50.620
but i thought you'd like to see.

28:50.870 --> 28:53.832
posted by anonymous
Horatio caine dies today

28:53.957 --> 28:56.876
"Horatio caine dies today. "

29:01.339 --> 29:02.924
sir,they may come after you.

29:02.966 --> 29:04.384
Then i'll be ready.

29:14.728 --> 29:15.979
Ryan,where's my mom?

29:16.021 --> 29:18.148
She said she'd be
right here with the car.

29:21.609 --> 29:22.902
Ryan,help!

29:25.697 --> 29:26.906
Ryan!

29:31.494 --> 29:32.537
Get out of the way.

29:39.044 --> 29:40.962
candace over here

29:50.847 --> 29:54.184
So it takes two csis to
process someone these days?

29:54.225 --> 29:57.479
You guys must be more desperate
to get me back than i thought.

29:57.520 --> 29:58.188
Come on,ryan.

29:58.229 --> 30:01.399
I heard about the attack,and i
wanted to make sure you were okay.

30:01.441 --> 30:02.275
That's very sweet of you.

30:02.317 --> 30:06.529
The guy did get the jump on me,but
he didn't get away scot-free.

30:06.571 --> 30:07.405
What ya got?

30:07.447 --> 30:09.741
I got dna from our attacker.

30:10.492 --> 30:11.785
Ryan!

30:16.414 --> 30:18.249
That's a nice get,ryan.

30:18.291 --> 30:22.837
You know,if the dna of the attacker
matches the dna of luke selyan's killer,

30:22.879 --> 30:24.214
you just broke the case.

30:24.255 --> 30:25.548
I just broke the case.

30:26.091 --> 30:27.884
That's not bad,wolverine.

30:27.968 --> 30:30.053
You couldn't have grabbed a
handful of hair just in case?

30:30.095 --> 30:33.181
That would be funny if
a girl wasn't assaulted.

30:33.848 --> 30:35.600
Yeah,you're right. I'm sorry.

30:36.101 --> 30:37.227
I'll see you later.

30:37.268 --> 30:38.144
Later.

30:39.729 --> 30:41.982
You know i was starting
to miss this place.

30:42.023 --> 30:42.691
Don't let him fool you.

30:42.732 --> 30:45.527
We're all very excited
to get you back here.

30:46.152 --> 30:48.029
I'm going to take this to natalia.

31:05.255 --> 31:07.799
You're not going to believe
who attacked ryan and candace.

31:07.841 --> 31:10.302
My guess is robert
whitten,the athletic director.

31:10.343 --> 31:14.264
It was unnerving how proud he was at
the way candace was being exploited.

31:14.306 --> 31:16.433
You are not even close.

31:16.766 --> 31:18.852
It's candace's dad.

31:23.940 --> 31:25.692
Lieutenant,i'm in a hurry right now.

31:25.734 --> 31:27.694
I need to go and meet
up with my daughter.

31:27.736 --> 31:29.029
So what's this all about?

31:29.070 --> 31:31.823
It's time for you to
come clean,Mr. Walker.

31:32.449 --> 31:34.200
I'm not sure what you're talking about.

31:34.242 --> 31:38.747
It was you who attacked candace
outside the photo studio,wasn't it?

31:38.997 --> 31:40.498
That's ridiculous.

31:40.540 --> 31:42.751
Why don't you tell me what happened?

31:48.131 --> 31:50.550
I w... I wasn't trying to hurt her.

31:50.592 --> 31:51.885
Wanted to scare her.

31:51.926 --> 31:53.845
Yeah,i wanted to scare them both.

31:53.887 --> 31:57.265
I mean,ever since that picture showed
up,my wife has been parading her around,

31:57.307 --> 32:00.310
making her do endorsements,pushing
her further and further into...

32:01.061 --> 32:02.687
Into the spotlight.

32:06.191 --> 32:08.401
I was trying to protect my daughter.

32:13.531 --> 32:15.367
Sometimes fear can be a good thing.

32:15.408 --> 32:19.496
On the contrary,Mr.
Walker,fear is a killer.

32:30.882 --> 32:33.009
Father attacking his own daughter?

32:33.051 --> 32:34.344
I can't understand that.

32:34.427 --> 32:36.680
He's a desperate man,frank.

32:37.639 --> 32:39.599
Is everything all right with you?

32:41.017 --> 32:43.061
Nothing i can't handle.

33:05.667 --> 33:06.418
Av.

33:06.459 --> 33:10.380
Miss barrish,have there been any
more postings as to my location?

33:10.463 --> 33:12.257
- No,not since the walker residence.
- Good.

33:12.299 --> 33:13.675
I'm going to send you something.

33:13.717 --> 33:14.676
What'd you have in mind?

33:14.718 --> 33:15.885
It's a location.

33:15.927 --> 33:17.387
Please put it online.

33:17.429 --> 33:18.680
Thank you,ma'am.

33:32.979 --> 33:34.272
Hi. is that our murder weapon?

33:34.313 --> 33:36.441
It is. I'm just bringing
it back from dna,

33:36.482 --> 33:38.151
and you know,I have to say, I

33:38.192 --> 33:40.445
i think i'd rather tote
one of these than a gun.

33:40.486 --> 33:41.821
Why's that?

33:41.863 --> 33:44.866
Triggers are tough
and,you know,this is easy.

33:45.575 --> 33:48.036
Nat,hold it right there.

33:48.244 --> 33:49.245
Why?

33:50.121 --> 33:55.126
Robert whitten said that each bow
is calibrated for a specific user.

33:55.501 --> 33:57.962
26 inches is our draw length.

33:58.504 --> 34:03.551
Draw length is determined by measuring the
shooter's arm span and dividing it by 2.5.

34:03.593 --> 34:07.263
So multiply 26 by 2.5 and you
get the shooter's arm span?

34:07.305 --> 34:11.851
And seeing as arm span is approximately
the same as a person's height...

34:11.893 --> 34:15.688
Our shooter would be about 5'5".

34:15.730 --> 34:18.690
And the draw weight on this
bow is set at 25 pounds,

34:18.733 --> 34:23.237
which would mean our shooter is
roughly weighing in at about a hundred.

34:23.279 --> 34:25.489
Well,that's definitely
not robert whitten.

34:25.531 --> 34:27.699
The archery team is
made up of nine boys.

34:27.742 --> 34:31.621
Well,then,we're either talking
about a sixth-grader or...

34:31.663 --> 34:33.873
Or our shooter was a woman.

34:37.335 --> 34:41.089
This footage was taken by surveillance
glasses that were being worn by luke.

34:41.130 --> 34:42.632
I have a great ass.

34:42.674 --> 34:43.757
So?

34:44.550 --> 34:45.842
Have a look.

34:46.636 --> 34:48.929
Do you recognize this?

34:50.139 --> 34:52.975
There you are,holding
coach whitten's keys.

34:55.143 --> 34:57.897
Mr. Whitten,i need the
keys to your office.

34:57.939 --> 35:00.024
I left my thong in there the other day.

35:00.066 --> 35:01.401
Okay,okay,shut up.

35:01.442 --> 35:02.527
Here,here.

35:08.116 --> 35:10.118
I'm certain he'd testify to that,

35:10.159 --> 35:14.872
especially if he doesn't want to add accessory
to murder to his statutory rape charge.

35:14.914 --> 35:18.960
I'm also willing to bet that he
taught you how to use the bow.

35:22.171 --> 35:23.840
It wasn't fair.

35:23.881 --> 35:27.593
Everybody said i was prettier
than candace anda better swimmer,

35:27.635 --> 35:31.431
and here was another meet and
everybody was taking pictures of her,

35:31.514 --> 35:34.684
all because of that one
picture that made her famous.

35:34.726 --> 35:36.185
I couldn't take it anymore.

35:46.612 --> 35:50.074
You never intended to hit luke;
this was about candace all along.

36:10.595 --> 36:16.517
You used the starting pistol not as a
distraction but for what it actually was.

36:16.559 --> 36:20.563
You heard it and fired,hoping you
would hit candace as she jumped.

36:20.772 --> 36:25.902
She's been slow off the block ever
since her cyber-lebrity started.

36:26.194 --> 36:28.363
I gave her too much credit.

36:28.404 --> 36:30.615
You killed luke by mistake.

36:34.661 --> 36:37.872
Officer,would you please take
this young lady to booking?

37:26.087 --> 37:27.088
damon.

37:28.673 --> 37:30.299
You kept your word.

37:31.467 --> 37:32.969
Not yet.

37:34.262 --> 37:38.307
What,you just expect me to fill in all
those years you took my dad away from me?

37:38.349 --> 37:39.726
I know how you feel,damon.

37:39.767 --> 37:43.604
How can you know unless
you felt what i felt?

37:43.646 --> 37:47.066
I know because i've lost family,too.

37:47.108 --> 37:49.193
I didn't lose my dad.

37:49.736 --> 37:51.446
You took him from me!

37:51.487 --> 37:53.072
- Damon...
- do not move!

37:53.114 --> 37:54.907
I said stop!

37:55.950 --> 37:58.828
Damon,your father was a killer
who hurt a lot of people.

37:58.870 --> 38:01.331
I couldn't leave him on the street.

38:06.502 --> 38:11.716
Damon,like i said,you have a choice.

38:11.799 --> 38:14.552
Don't make the mistake that he made.

38:15.511 --> 38:16.846
Don't worry.

38:18.514 --> 38:20.016
I won't.

38:38.368 --> 38:39.786
Blanks.

38:48.795 --> 38:50.797
Hands on your head.

38:57.261 --> 38:59.722
You knew i was going
to take it,didn't you?

38:59.931 --> 39:02.475
And i was hoping you wouldn't,son.

39:02.642 --> 39:04.477
I really was.

39:16.948 --> 39:20.243
Looks like your 15 minutes
just rolled over to miranda.

39:23.287 --> 39:26.624
It appears there is a new queen in town.

39:27.083 --> 39:29.627
The crown is all hers.

40:08.791 --> 40:11.461
miranda has the right to remain hot
