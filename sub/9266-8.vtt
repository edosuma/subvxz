00:25.467 --> 00:26.435
Son, you all right? -

00:26.469 --> 00:28.103
- Oh, god! Contraction!
- You're seven months pregnant.

00:28.137 --> 00:29.336
You're not contracting.
Please go to the hospital.

00:29.371 --> 00:30.805
You're going to need to go on bed rest

00:30.839 --> 00:32.406
Until the baby's full-term.

00:32.441 --> 00:34.508
I don't exactly have insurance right now.

00:34.543 --> 00:35.608
I'll figure out something.

00:35.643 --> 00:37.110
I got a business opportunity

00:37.144 --> 00:38.244
That really could make you a rich man.

00:38.279 --> 00:40.346
- Nice.
- Yeah.

00:40.381 --> 00:42.414
I thought he was the one.

00:42.449 --> 00:43.782
I know, sweetie.

00:43.817 --> 00:46.819
I'm sorry, babe. - Do your thg, skeeter.

00:46.853 --> 00:48.320
That's pretty great.

00:48.354 --> 00:51.055
Texas forever.

00:52.090 --> 00:53.591
I think either one of
them would be nice, hon.

00:54.325 --> 00:55.392
This one still has a tag on it.
Might as well wear that one.

00:55.425 --> 00:56.726
It's brand-new.

00:56.760 --> 00:58.161
Honey, you know you've got
to put your toiletries

00:58.195 --> 01:00.730
Into the plastic travel bag. These are ugly.

01:00.764 --> 01:01.831
I'm not bringing those. - Don't take those.

01:01.865 --> 01:02.964
Have you seen my bright blue shirt?

01:02.999 --> 01:04.965
Gracie doesn't have any pants.

01:05.001 --> 01:06.234
It's in with the dry cleaning.
Let me get it.

01:06.269 --> 01:07.502
But now get that stuff together.
We've got to go.

01:07.537 --> 01:08.637
Do you know where gracie's pants are?

01:08.671 --> 01:09.837
We've got less than a half an hour.

01:09.871 --> 01:10.838
Do you know where fracie's pants are?

01:10.872 --> 01:11.839
Hi, sweet angel.

01:11.873 --> 01:13.040
They're in the bottom drawer.

01:13.074 --> 01:14.041
You're gonna help your
daddy find your pants.

01:14.075 --> 01:15.441
The bottom drawer, sweetie.

01:15.476 --> 01:16.976
You realize none of my
outfits are gonna work

01:17.011 --> 01:17.977
Unless I have that shirt.

01:18.012 --> 01:19.679
I'm getting it right now.

01:19.713 --> 01:21.047
They're not in the bottom drawer.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.148
Well, if not, then check in the dryer.

01:23.183 --> 01:24.683
Come on. Bring your spaceman.

01:24.717 --> 01:25.884
I know. We got to get your pants on.

01:25.919 --> 01:26.885
Mom, every outfit you packed

01:26.920 --> 01:28.120
I look like a realtor in.

01:28.154 --> 01:29.487
All right now. Hey, y'all need to pack up...

01:29.521 --> 01:30.788
Honey, you're gonna look
amazing and beautiful

01:30.823 --> 01:31.856
For your interviews. - And let's get going.

01:31.890 --> 01:33.090
You give 'em hell up there,

01:33.125 --> 01:34.392
You understand me? - See.
You found the pants.

01:34.426 --> 01:35.992
That's great. - All right?

01:36.027 --> 01:37.994
All right, time to go.
You were five minutes late

01:38.029 --> 01:39.062
Five minutes ago. - Bye, dad.

01:39.096 --> 01:40.130
- Good
-bye.

01:40.164 --> 01:41.464
You're gonna be great for your daddy.

01:41.499 --> 01:43.632
Oh, shoot, I got to grab my briefcase.

01:43.667 --> 01:45.668
Andnot that anybody cares we have

01:45.702 --> 01:48.702
The league's two last-place teams facing off

01:48.736 --> 01:50.804
This Friday-- the east dillon lions

01:50.839 --> 01:53.207
Versus the campo park timberwolves.

01:53.241 --> 01:55.808
Folks, I don't mean to be crude,

01:55.843 --> 01:56.876
But I understand that this game

01:56.910 --> 01:58.578
Has unofficially been called

01:58.612 --> 02:00.379
The toilet bowl.

02:00.414 --> 02:01.480
If you're coach taylor,

02:01.515 --> 02:02.647
You got to see this game

02:02.682 --> 02:05.050
As a singular opportunity

02:05.084 --> 02:07.953
To get a "w" on the books this season.

02:20.932 --> 02:23.500
Hey, ma, do I have a follo
w-up with the doctor?

02:24.235 --> 02:25.902
He said he didn't need to see you again

02:25.937 --> 02:28.471
Unless it's still hurting
in a couple of weeks.

02:28.506 --> 02:30.105
It's doing good, right?

02:30.140 --> 02:32.107
I mean, you've been going
to practice and everything.

02:32.142 --> 02:34.209
Yeah. No, I'm good.

02:34.244 --> 02:37.345
I've been driving by this property and...

02:37.379 --> 02:38.479
yeah.

02:38.514 --> 02:40.114
Wow.

02:40.149 --> 02:43.650
It doesn't have a price on there,

02:43.685 --> 02:45.919
And I was just... - Yeah. A steal.

02:45.954 --> 02:47.454
$85,000.

02:47.488 --> 02:51.624
$75,000 if you could pay half
the purchasing price up front.

02:51.658 --> 02:53.125
Might that be an option?

02:55.728 --> 02:57.729
Um...

03:06.338 --> 03:09.005
Hey, yeah, I know that we
hang out all the time--

03:09.039 --> 03:11.307
Exactly. So why we got to call it a date?

03:11.342 --> 03:13.142
Because there's a very distinct difference

03:13.177 --> 03:16.011
In just hanging out and an actual date.

03:16.045 --> 03:19.314
I would be wearing a nice button-up shirt.

03:19.349 --> 03:21.916
And you would probably be wearing,
like, a nice skirt

03:21.950 --> 03:22.917
Or something like that. - Yeah.

03:22.951 --> 03:24.018
And it would be nighttime.

03:24.052 --> 03:25.653
When you say a nice shirt, though,

03:25.687 --> 03:27.989
You don't mean the one
with the periodic table.

03:28.023 --> 03:29.956
I have other really nice shirts.

03:29.991 --> 03:32.125
I have a bunch of really nice shirts.

03:32.159 --> 03:36.028
Yeah, um, I have Wednesday night off.

03:36.062 --> 03:37.796
- Perfect.
- So Wednesday night?

03:37.831 --> 03:38.964
Wednes--I love wednesdays.

03:38.999 --> 03:39.965
Yeah. - Okay.

03:40.000 --> 03:40.966
- Great.
- All right.

03:41.001 --> 03:42.266
- Good night.
- Cool.

03:42.301 --> 03:44.469
Okay.

03:51.976 --> 03:54.144
Full-pad Monday. Everyone ought to be happy.

03:54.178 --> 03:55.444
You know what, it doesn't matter

03:55.479 --> 03:57.680
Whether you win or lose,

03:57.714 --> 03:59.982
It's how you plaz the gam
e- who's heard that before?

04:00.017 --> 04:02.784
Well, that doesn't apply
to this team anymore.

04:02.818 --> 04:03.985
Listen to me.

04:04.020 --> 04:05.620
Individually, we ought to be damn proud

04:05.655 --> 04:06.821
Of where we come from

04:06.856 --> 04:08.189
And where we are right now.

04:08.224 --> 04:09.823
Collectively, I think we've got

04:09.858 --> 04:12.526
A hell of a football team here.

04:12.560 --> 04:13.894
But we're not scrappers anymore.

04:13.928 --> 04:16.495
We're lions.

04:16.529 --> 04:20.065
And this is our time.

04:20.100 --> 04:23.001
This is your time.

04:23.036 --> 04:25.203
We got a week for this game coming up.

04:25.238 --> 04:26.872
I want you to know I'm proud

04:26.906 --> 04:27.906
To take the field with you.

04:29.441 --> 04:31.175
Let's practice.

04:37.782 --> 04:40.784
Let's go!

04:50.192 --> 04:52.193
What's going on?

05:01.669 --> 05:10.275
* *

05:49.609 --> 05:57.615
* *

06:26.775 --> 06:28.941
So we have a fabulous contradiction here.

06:28.976 --> 06:30.676
Chaucer is the founder

06:30.711 --> 06:31.978
Of modern english poetry,

06:32.012 --> 06:34.580
But he also uses words

06:34.615 --> 06:36.715
Like "ass" and "fart."

06:36.749 --> 06:40.786
So what does chaucer's very deliberate use

06:40.820 --> 06:41.919
Of language tell us?

06:41.953 --> 06:44.588
Anyone?

06:46.224 --> 06:49.659
Someone. Come on, really.

06:49.693 --> 06:52.028
Yes, ma'am?

06:52.062 --> 06:53.463
Do you want to answer?

06:53.497 --> 06:55.297
Oh, no, I'm just observing.

06:55.331 --> 06:56.465
Oh, no, that's okay.

06:56.499 --> 06:57.900
It seems you have a thought.

06:57.934 --> 06:59.434
Please, share.

06:59.469 --> 07:03.971
Oh, well, would it have
to do with the context?

07:04.006 --> 07:06.574
You know, who's speaking?

07:06.608 --> 07:08.308
Exactly.

07:08.342 --> 07:10.544
- - context. Who's speaking.

07:10.578 --> 07:12.712
Think about the knight's tale.

07:12.747 --> 07:14.047
- Mm
-hmm.

07:14.081 --> 07:15.781
A story of romantic love...

07:17.984 --> 07:19.652
To the middle!

07:21.288 --> 07:22.487
Whoo!

07:22.521 --> 07:24.088
Let's see you throw it like that

07:24.123 --> 07:26.825
Without tipping off the
safety with your shoulders.

07:29.294 --> 07:30.727
All right, looking good.

07:30.762 --> 07:31.995
Looking good!

07:34.699 --> 07:37.500
Yeah!

07:37.534 --> 07:38.835
- Let's blitz.
- Here we go.

07:38.869 --> 07:40.603
Hit to hurt, gentlemen. Let's go.

07:42.038 --> 07:45.140
Down the field. That's it, that's it.

07:47.677 --> 07:51.745
Fours, come here.

07:51.780 --> 07:53.914
You all right?

07:53.949 --> 07:55.014
- Yeah.
- You sure?

07:55.049 --> 07:56.282
- Mm-hmm.
- All right, let's go.

07:58.986 --> 08:01.187
Grab the ball, luke. Here we go.

08:05.992 --> 08:08.426
Whoo!

08:08.460 --> 08:10.962
Look what the cat drug in.

08:12.231 --> 08:14.165
Ain't got any need for a toilet, do you?

08:14.199 --> 08:15.765
No, I don't.

08:15.800 --> 08:17.701
I've never heard such malarkey
in my life. Hey, eric.

08:17.735 --> 08:19.636
- Good to see you.
- You too.

08:19.670 --> 08:22.104
joe, keep the elbow up.

08:22.138 --> 08:25.174
Toilet bowl, god help us.

08:25.208 --> 08:28.109
I just want to tell you that I...

08:28.143 --> 08:30.678
I used to be something

08:30.713 --> 08:32.981
For the dillon panthers.

08:33.015 --> 08:35.716
And I want to be that way here.

08:35.750 --> 08:37.417
I can help you.

08:37.452 --> 08:38.619
I'm gonna do that.

08:38.653 --> 08:40.621
I just want to let you know that.

08:40.655 --> 08:44.222
All right.

08:48.261 --> 08:49.361
keep your hands--

08:49.395 --> 08:50.795
No, no, put it back.

08:50.830 --> 08:53.465
darius!

08:53.499 --> 08:55.165
darius! Caleb!

08:59.704 --> 09:01.638
Let go!

09:01.672 --> 09:03.806
What's up? Look, look, look, look.

09:03.841 --> 09:05.375
We're gonna run a pos
t-route with the sunflower seeds.

09:05.409 --> 09:08.543
Go, go, go. - Look at this.

09:08.578 --> 09:10.646
Are you seriously teaching
them to throw food in a--

09:10.680 --> 09:12.414
Oh, you can't teach that.
That was a great job.

09:12.448 --> 09:13.682
What's wrong with you?

09:13.716 --> 09:14.815
- That's talent.
- Hey.

09:14.850 --> 09:15.983
Look at all you boys.

09:16.018 --> 09:17.485
I haven't seen you in such a long time.

09:17.519 --> 09:18.753
You've grown.

09:18.787 --> 09:20.421
Darius, did anybody tell you you look

09:20.455 --> 09:21.721
More and more like your daddy?

09:21.756 --> 09:22.722
Yes, ma'am.

09:22.757 --> 09:24.324
I bet they do.

09:24.358 --> 09:25.558
You know, I tell you what,

09:25.593 --> 09:26.693
I'm cooking dinner next week,

09:26.727 --> 09:28.127
And I want you to be there.

09:30.063 --> 09:31.030
- Me?
- Yup.

09:31.064 --> 09:32.998
Oh, no, I wouldn't want

09:33.033 --> 09:34.166
To impose on...

09:34.200 --> 09:35.433
No, no, no, you're not imposing.

09:35.467 --> 09:37.101
I'm gonna cook for us,

09:37.136 --> 09:38.703
And I expect you to be there, okay?

09:38.737 --> 09:39.871
Final answer.

09:39.905 --> 09:42.105
Hey, you boys be good now.

09:42.140 --> 09:44.007
Listen to what she tells you to do, okay?

09:44.042 --> 09:45.242
Yes, ma'am.

09:45.276 --> 09:47.711
I'll see you. Come on, baby. Come on.

09:47.745 --> 09:49.445
Keep those.

09:49.479 --> 09:50.579
Let 'em have the pancakes.

09:50.614 --> 09:51.747
Can I get the pancakes, please?

09:51.782 --> 09:52.782
- No, you can't.
- Let 'em.

09:52.816 --> 09:54.350
Stop. You hush.

09:57.219 --> 09:59.321
I mean, honestly, before you
were a guidance counselor,

09:59.355 --> 10:00.388
I don't think  got any applications

10:00.423 --> 10:01.722
From your district.

10:01.756 --> 10:03.290
Well, you know, I think once y'all came down

10:03.325 --> 10:05.326
To the fair, it just put
a face to the school

10:05.360 --> 10:07.027
And let the kids realize

10:07.062 --> 10:09.462
It's not so far away,

10:09.496 --> 10:10.663
And it's a real opportunity for 'em.

10:10.698 --> 10:11.831
Well, I'm just so glad you came up to b.C.

10:11.865 --> 10:13.166
We are too.

10:13.200 --> 10:14.900
Julie, how do you like it so far?

10:14.934 --> 10:17.769
Um, it looks exactly like the brochure.

10:17.804 --> 10:18.971
Beautiful.

10:19.005 --> 10:20.872
Did you get a chance to
sit in on any classes?

10:20.907 --> 10:22.840
Yeah, an english class.

10:22.874 --> 10:24.375
Oh, great. How was it?

10:24.409 --> 10:26.010
It was good.

10:26.044 --> 10:27.011
It was great.

10:27.045 --> 10:28.178
We had so much fun.

10:28.212 --> 10:29.646
It was professor paulson's class.

10:29.680 --> 10:31.047
Oh, vanessa.

10:31.082 --> 10:33.316
Her class is like being at
some fabulous dinner party.

10:33.351 --> 10:35.351
<i>- It made me want to go
get the canterbury tales,</i>

10:35.385 --> 10:37.419
Just read it for fun all over again.

10:37.454 --> 10:39.054
- Mm-hmm.
- Jules loves to read too,

10:39.089 --> 10:40.222
Don't you, honey?

10:40.256 --> 10:42.223
I think she got that from me.

10:42.257 --> 10:43.925
This place is so gorgeous.

10:43.959 --> 10:46.828
You have a big game coming up this weekend.

10:46.862 --> 10:48.061
What do you have to say about it?

10:50.631 --> 10:51.898
All right.

10:54.901 --> 10:57.370
Yeah.

10:57.404 --> 10:59.672
Some chick named mindy's
on the phone for you,

10:59.706 --> 11:00.973
And she sounds really crazy,

11:01.008 --> 11:02.240
So do you want me to just blow her off?

11:02.274 --> 11:03.441
No.

11:03.476 --> 11:05.744
Hey, skeeter.

11:05.778 --> 11:07.746
Hi. - Mins.

11:07.779 --> 11:10.347
Hey, tim, I can't get a hold of billy,

11:10.382 --> 11:11.448
And the toilet's backed up,

11:11.483 --> 11:13.283
And I need you to get over here.

11:13.318 --> 11:15.918
Um, see, I've had a few too many,

11:15.953 --> 11:17.453
So I can't drive.

11:17.488 --> 11:19.922
Actually, this isn't about you
and your drinking problem.

11:19.957 --> 11:21.123
It's about me and my baby,

11:21.157 --> 11:22.257
And the toilet is toxic.

11:22.291 --> 11:23.959
And I pee every five minutes.

11:23.993 --> 11:25.027
And I don't know where your brother is,

11:25.061 --> 11:26.428
And I really need you to be here.

11:26.462 --> 11:28.095
So go in the bathtub.

11:28.130 --> 11:29.530
I'm not gonna go in the bathtub!

11:29.564 --> 11:31.899
I am on bed rest. Get your ass over here!

11:36.804 --> 11:38.772
Can you drive stick?

11:40.641 --> 11:43.242
Remember, the clutch is
your best friend, okay?

11:43.276 --> 11:46.145
I'm not really sure what
you mean when you say that.

11:46.179 --> 11:48.379
Just let--

11:48.414 --> 11:50.548
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

11:50.582 --> 11:55.218
I don't have air bags, by the way.

11:55.253 --> 11:57.988
Relax. Relax.

11:59.891 --> 12:01.290
So why were you in a suit today?

12:01.324 --> 12:06.295
Oh, that's a good question.

12:06.329 --> 12:08.296
Some guys aren't meant to be in a suit,

12:08.330 --> 12:11.699
And some guys are.

12:15.070 --> 12:17.471
It's green.

12:17.505 --> 12:19.306
The light's green. Here we go.

12:20.809 --> 12:22.075
Wrench me.

12:22.109 --> 12:24.410
- Ew.
- Where is billy anyways?

12:24.445 --> 12:27.180
Doing some big job down at the rig.

12:27.214 --> 12:28.447
This late?

12:28.481 --> 12:30.782
You didn't know that?

12:30.817 --> 12:33.518
Yeah, I knew that.

12:35.654 --> 12:38.089
He's been working a lot of nights lately.

12:38.123 --> 12:40.724
Yeah, well, it's getting busy, min,

12:40.759 --> 12:41.825
Which is a good thing.

12:41.859 --> 12:43.560
It's not a big deal, right?

12:43.594 --> 12:44.561
What do you mean?

12:44.595 --> 12:47.729
Like, if I call him,

12:47.764 --> 12:51.100
And he's all distracted,
and he's tired all the time,

12:51.134 --> 12:55.069
And if I walk into a room
and he's on the phone,

12:55.104 --> 12:57.738
Then he hangs up really quickly?

12:57.773 --> 13:02.008
Mins, what you're saying is not happening.

13:02.043 --> 13:04.177
He is having an affair, isn't he?

13:04.212 --> 13:05.779
No, he's not.

13:05.813 --> 13:07.280
I don't even want to know.

13:07.315 --> 13:08.414
That's the sad part.

13:08.448 --> 13:09.415
How pathetic am I?

13:09.449 --> 13:10.583
I don't even want to know

13:10.617 --> 13:11.717
If my husband's cheating on me

13:11.751 --> 13:12.985
Because I'm a total mess.

13:23.495 --> 13:25.195
Yeah, I mean, this is an emerging team.

13:25.230 --> 13:28.498
Equals emerging opportunity.

13:37.974 --> 13:39.141
- Oh, no, no.
- He thinks you want free time.

13:39.175 --> 13:41.075
I understand. I'm a businessman.

13:41.109 --> 13:43.144
I understand that.

13:43.178 --> 13:44.545
This is a new demographic for you--

13:44.579 --> 13:45.746
Football.

13:45.780 --> 13:47.614
- Football.
- American football, yeah.

13:51.552 --> 13:53.086
- No, no, I understood that.
- Buddy.

13:53.120 --> 13:54.486
American football.

13:54.521 --> 13:55.521
And I understand you.

13:55.555 --> 13:58.090
<i>- Uno momento. Yeah, what?</i>

13:58.124 --> 13:59.791
You think this is really necessary?

13:59.826 --> 14:01.626
If they want to talk trash about us,
the hell with them.

14:01.660 --> 14:03.127
Let's just get out of here. I'm an investor.

14:03.162 --> 14:04.362
They understand that.

14:04.396 --> 14:07.731
This is a chance for us to have a voice.

14:07.765 --> 14:09.266
We can stop all the trash talk

14:09.300 --> 14:11.535
That's going on. This can make a difference.

14:11.569 --> 14:13.170
Do you think we can do this
within another five minutes?

14:13.204 --> 14:14.270
Yes.

14:14.304 --> 14:16.272
Just...Keep going.

14:16.306 --> 14:17.306
<i>- Senor. - Yes.</i>

14:17.340 --> 14:18.641
Yes.

14:18.675 --> 14:21.109
You say you want english
on a spanish station?

14:21.143 --> 14:22.343
Just--just for the football games.

14:24.547 --> 14:26.381
What the hell you doing?

14:26.415 --> 14:29.216
Mornin'.

14:29.250 --> 14:31.018
Yeah, morning.

14:31.052 --> 14:32.186
You can be honest with me, man.

14:32.220 --> 14:34.687
I'm just-- are you messing around on mindy?

14:36.456 --> 14:39.825
No. No.

14:39.860 --> 14:41.560
'cause I know you've been working late

14:41.594 --> 14:43.295
And all that kind of stuff,
and I was over there,

14:43.329 --> 14:45.063
And she's all worried and stressed out.

14:45.097 --> 14:46.264
And maybe-- - I'm not cheating on mindy.

14:46.299 --> 14:47.464
All right?

14:47.499 --> 14:50.000
- What's all this late
-night stuff then?

14:50.035 --> 14:54.537
Just doing a little afte
r-hours work, that's all.

14:54.572 --> 14:57.006
- What kind of after
-hours work?

14:57.041 --> 14:59.342
You know, it's the kind of after-hours work

14:59.376 --> 15:01.143
That you can't really do in the daytime.

15:01.177 --> 15:04.646
You get it? - No, billy, I don't get it.

15:04.681 --> 15:06.448
That's why I'm asking. What do you mean?

15:06.482 --> 15:08.649
After-hours-- - okay.

15:08.684 --> 15:10.985
A couple guys came to me a couple weeks ago,

15:11.019 --> 15:14.054
And they gave me a little proposition, and--

15:14.088 --> 15:16.823
What kind of proposition?

15:16.857 --> 15:19.659
Once or twice a week,
they come by with a car,

15:19.694 --> 15:21.694
And I break it down to its component parts.

15:21.728 --> 15:25.064
They need it turned around in a quick time,

15:25.098 --> 15:26.832
And they pay really well... - Chop shop.

15:30.836 --> 15:33.471
That's the stupidest...

15:33.505 --> 15:35.505
Yeah, well, it's a plan, tim.

15:35.540 --> 15:36.506
You got a better plan?

15:36.541 --> 15:39.042
Yeah, billy.

15:39.077 --> 15:40.210
We had a plan.

15:40.245 --> 15:42.144
I mean, we just had a party here

15:42.179 --> 15:44.347
And raised buckets of money.
Buckets of money?

15:44.381 --> 15:45.348
Where's all that money then, billy?

15:45.382 --> 15:46.482
Buckets of money. You want to know

15:46.516 --> 15:47.515
Where that money is, tim? - Yeah, I do.

15:47.552 --> 15:48.954
One meeting with a specialist.

15:48.988 --> 15:50.388
That money's gone.

15:50.423 --> 15:52.023
You got any other plans, tell me about 'em.

15:52.058 --> 15:53.024
Yeah, billy.

15:53.059 --> 15:54.959
This.

15:54.993 --> 15:56.827
This was our plan, billy.

15:56.862 --> 15:58.829
Riggins' rigs.

15:58.864 --> 16:01.097
Tim, it's a temporary thing.

16:01.131 --> 16:03.766
- Temporary thing
--you have no idea what you're risking.

16:03.801 --> 16:05.368
Look, nobody's getting hurt here, man.

16:05.402 --> 16:06.769
You keep reminding me,

16:06.804 --> 16:08.770
Like, every week that you have a family,

16:08.805 --> 16:13.008
And this mechanic shop
is some dream of yours.

16:13.042 --> 16:15.076
Tim, that's the whole
reason I'm doing this, okay?

16:15.110 --> 16:17.345
The whole reason I'm doing
this is for my family.

16:17.379 --> 16:20.181
This is gonna prevent
me from going bankrupt.

16:20.215 --> 16:21.915
It's gonna make sure

16:21.949 --> 16:23.884
That mindy's gonna be okay and
that my baby's gonna be okay.

16:23.918 --> 16:25.118
All right?

16:25.152 --> 16:26.553
And once it's over with,

16:26.587 --> 16:28.621
Everything will go back to normal.

16:28.655 --> 16:32.091
I can't...

16:38.330 --> 16:42.499
oh, I love this school.

16:42.533 --> 16:44.167
I know. It's your favorite.

16:44.202 --> 16:48.237
Did I ever tell you this
was my first-choice school?

16:48.272 --> 16:49.739
Only, like, a million times.

16:49.773 --> 16:51.641
But no pressure or anything, right?

16:51.675 --> 16:54.743
What do you mean? Of course, no pressure.

16:57.280 --> 16:59.681
You'd have disowned me if I
didn't apply to this college.

16:59.715 --> 17:02.917
What are you talking about?

17:05.020 --> 17:06.819
You've just been staring over my shoulder,

17:06.855 --> 17:09.722
Looking at every syllable that
I've put into every application

17:09.757 --> 17:11.156
Since I started the college process.

17:11.191 --> 17:13.626
Wait a minute. You decided
where you wanted to apply.

17:13.661 --> 17:14.660
I have been trying to help you

17:14.694 --> 17:17.429
In that process.

17:17.463 --> 17:20.031
But, honey, it's up to you
what school you go to.

17:20.066 --> 17:21.598
It's not up to me.

17:21.633 --> 17:22.900
All I'm trying to do

17:22.935 --> 17:25.169
Is--is support you as
you're making that decision,

17:25.203 --> 17:26.904
That's all.

17:26.939 --> 17:29.039
You get me?

17:29.073 --> 17:30.740
Yeah.

17:30.775 --> 17:31.775
You sure about that?

17:34.544 --> 17:35.978
Yeah.

17:38.648 --> 17:42.283
- * shoobie
-doo-wah *

17:42.318 --> 17:44.452
* shoobie-doo-wah *

17:44.486 --> 17:47.621
* shoobie-doo-wah *

17:47.655 --> 17:50.123
* *

17:50.158 --> 17:51.258
* oh *

17:51.292 --> 17:53.760
* strange *-- hold on.

17:53.795 --> 17:55.962
* oh *

17:55.996 --> 17:59.198
* oh * - * feel strange *

17:59.232 --> 18:00.632
I can't hit that note.

18:00.666 --> 18:02.000
I'm sorry.

18:02.034 --> 18:03.201
Is something the matter today, landry?

18:03.235 --> 18:04.336
No, I just couldn't hit that note,

18:04.370 --> 18:06.071
And I got frustrated. - He got stood up.

18:06.105 --> 18:08.772
I did not get stood up, jimmy.

18:08.807 --> 18:10.441
Actually, the date was rescheduled

18:10.475 --> 18:11.909
Because of conflicts.

18:11.943 --> 18:13.776
And that might be a good thing

18:13.811 --> 18:18.581
Because Thursday is more of,
like, a sexual night anyways.

18:18.615 --> 18:19.782
So we're just gonna go

18:19.817 --> 18:22.250
Through the whole psychoanalytic breakdown?

18:22.285 --> 18:24.086
No, I'm saying, by 7:00 p.M.

18:24.120 --> 18:27.055
On Thursday, your brain
has basically clicked in

18:27.089 --> 18:28.422
That it's pretty much the weekend,

18:28.457 --> 18:30.658
But Wednesday's closer to Monday.

18:30.692 --> 18:33.094
And no one's getting busy on Monday, but...

18:33.128 --> 18:34.627
Get busy?

18:35.830 --> 18:38.999
Every now and then, people want to get busy.

18:41.868 --> 18:43.435
Ms. Howard, can I help you out in there?

18:43.470 --> 18:45.771
Oh, no, no, no, you stay put.

18:45.805 --> 18:48.673
I know you've been working hard.

18:48.707 --> 18:50.341
- You need help with that?
- Oh, no, baby, I got it.

18:50.376 --> 18:53.311
mm. Wow.

18:53.345 --> 18:54.945
So, jess, I must say bless your heart

18:54.979 --> 18:56.213
For joining us

18:56.247 --> 18:57.714
'cause I ain't never seen this boy

18:57.749 --> 18:59.783
Wear anything but a t-shirt.

19:01.118 --> 19:02.385
How you been?

19:02.419 --> 19:04.387
Oh, well, you know, I can't complain.

19:04.421 --> 19:06.622
Well, you know, I lost
my job down at the hotel,

19:06.656 --> 19:08.156
But that was because it was closing

19:08.190 --> 19:09.391
And whatnot, but, you know,

19:09.425 --> 19:11.059
I'm keeping myself really busy,

19:11.093 --> 19:13.528
So, um, I did some part-time work

19:13.562 --> 19:16.163
For this cleaning company,

19:16.197 --> 19:18.832
And, you know, that just
really didn't pan out.

19:18.867 --> 19:20.633
I think it was just because of doing

19:20.667 --> 19:22.235
The night school thing down at tech.

19:22.269 --> 19:23.469
You know, things start changing--

19:23.504 --> 19:25.338
Mama, these mashed potatoes are delicious.

19:25.372 --> 19:26.639
- Yeah, I know, baby.
- It's good.

19:26.673 --> 19:29.674
- So I'm planning, and...
- That's good.

19:29.709 --> 19:32.811
Yeah. My aunt said to tell you hello.

19:32.845 --> 19:34.812
- Oh.
- She's working down at this--

19:34.846 --> 19:36.414
For this new company-
you know what, honey?

19:36.448 --> 19:39.850
Do you know how amazing you are?

19:39.885 --> 19:41.351
I mean, do you know how amazing you are?

19:41.385 --> 19:44.754
'cause, when you were a little girl,

19:44.789 --> 19:49.124
I mean, this light would
just shine through you.

19:49.159 --> 19:50.492
And--and now look at you.

19:50.527 --> 19:53.728
You've become a beautiful young woman.

19:53.762 --> 19:57.031
- Thank you.
- Vincent, isn't she beautiful?

19:57.066 --> 19:58.666
- - I mean, look at her.

19:58.700 --> 19:59.967
Isn't she beautiful?

20:00.002 --> 20:02.035
- Oh, stop it.
- She's gorgeous.

20:05.239 --> 20:06.573
Mm. Yeah.

20:06.607 --> 20:09.542
Coach, you know you doomed,

20:09.576 --> 20:11.577
Unless you can come up with
some kind opassing game.

20:11.611 --> 20:13.479
Hey, why don't you let
coach worry about his game?

20:13.513 --> 20:17.048
Y'all need to worry about buying
some of this radio airtime.

20:17.083 --> 20:18.650
You know, buddy called me the other day.

20:18.684 --> 20:21.485
That man is on a mission.

20:21.519 --> 20:25.055
The roto-rooter talk's not
exactly morale-boosting, is it?

20:25.090 --> 20:26.323
Who are you telling?

20:26.357 --> 20:28.324
I bought 60 seconds, I'm a damn preacher.

20:28.358 --> 20:31.661
Hey, sure hope you make it
worth my while, come Friday.

20:31.695 --> 20:33.196
We'll do our best.

20:33.230 --> 20:34.930
Hey, this is pretty good brisket here.

20:34.964 --> 20:37.165
Thank you. Now I can die happy.

20:37.200 --> 20:39.634
He's warming up to me.

20:42.938 --> 20:45.906
Great. The internet's not working.

20:45.941 --> 20:47.240
I'm sorry, honey.

20:47.274 --> 20:50.176
Want to call downstairs?

20:50.211 --> 20:53.912
No.

20:53.947 --> 20:55.981
Jules.

20:56.015 --> 20:59.017
You all right, honey?

21:05.023 --> 21:06.990
I know I should be excited about this trip,

21:07.024 --> 21:09.526
And I know that we've been planning it

21:09.560 --> 21:13.496
For a really long time, and it's...

21:13.530 --> 21:16.499
Everything's just-- just happening so fast.

21:16.533 --> 21:19.502
I know. I know it seems like it.

21:19.536 --> 21:22.303
I know I'm letting yo.

21:22.338 --> 21:24.139
- Hey, huh
-uh.

21:24.173 --> 21:27.708
No, ma'am. Don't go there.

21:27.742 --> 21:30.043
How could you be letting me down?

21:30.078 --> 21:32.246
I feel like such a stupid mess.

21:32.280 --> 21:34.680
Like, hi, here I am. I got dumped.

21:34.715 --> 21:36.382
And I'm hanging out at
all these universities

21:36.416 --> 21:37.750
Where I don't belong.

21:37.784 --> 21:39.185
Of course you do.

21:39.219 --> 21:40.986
You belong anywhere you want.

21:41.020 --> 21:42.687
I don't know. It's like,
all these interviews,

21:42.722 --> 21:45.724
It's like... I'm expected to recite

21:45.758 --> 21:46.957
All these factoids about myself

21:46.992 --> 21:48.259
And tell them how perfect I am

21:48.293 --> 21:50.661
And why I'd be a good student,

21:50.695 --> 21:52.196
And it's just...

21:52.230 --> 21:55.598
It just seems fake.

21:58.068 --> 22:02.771
Well, I'll tell you what.

22:02.805 --> 22:04.173
The only thing you need to do

22:04.207 --> 22:08.543
In all these interviews
is go in and just be you.

22:10.445 --> 22:13.914
Just, you know,
look at this as an opportunity.

22:13.948 --> 22:17.050
This is an opportunity for your future.

22:17.084 --> 22:20.052
It's exciting.

22:20.086 --> 22:24.924
I'm gonna go take a shower.

22:38.336 --> 22:39.403
- Yo.
- What's up, man?

22:39.437 --> 22:41.204
- What up, c?
- Chillin'.

22:41.238 --> 22:42.972
Another day.

22:43.006 --> 22:46.375
I know you hungry.
Go ahead and eat something.

22:46.410 --> 22:49.311
What's up?

22:49.345 --> 22:51.313
Getting kind of boring stealing
these cars without you.

22:51.347 --> 22:53.948
Need my road dawg.

22:53.982 --> 22:56.450
I can't, man.

22:56.484 --> 22:58.352
I wish I could, but, you know,

22:58.386 --> 22:59.553
Gotta study these plays, you know.

22:59.588 --> 23:00.887
Right. Right. Plays.

23:00.921 --> 23:02.222
Plays. Yo.

23:04.725 --> 23:07.092
You know, ty and some of his boys

23:07.126 --> 23:09.061
Are gonna be down at the
park hooping later, man.

23:09.095 --> 23:10.696
You should definitely roll.
We could take 'em.

23:10.730 --> 23:12.297
I mean, you ain't that good,

23:12.332 --> 23:13.831
But, you know, you got me on your team,

23:13.865 --> 23:14.966
So we solid.

23:15.000 --> 23:15.967
Yeah, bro.

23:16.001 --> 23:17.969
Can't do it.

23:18.003 --> 23:19.570
Practice, you know.

23:19.605 --> 23:21.371
Coach is on my butt about it, so...

23:21.405 --> 23:23.773
Coach come first, huh?

23:25.343 --> 23:26.742
All right.

23:26.776 --> 23:28.377
It's not even like that, man.

23:28.411 --> 23:29.878
Listen, look, we gonna be hanging

23:29.913 --> 23:31.714
Real soon.

23:31.748 --> 23:33.748
I just can't get caught up, you know.

23:33.782 --> 23:36.317
My p.O., you know how it is.

23:36.352 --> 23:38.786
Yeah, I know how it is, man.

23:38.821 --> 23:40.587
All right.

23:47.294 --> 23:50.830
Okay, so when you walk in,
you want to have a presence.

23:50.864 --> 23:52.765
So smile-- are you paying attention?

23:52.799 --> 23:54.966
- Yeah.
- Okay. Walk tall.

23:55.001 --> 23:57.168
Come in. Sit.

23:59.605 --> 24:01.071
With your shoulders pulled back,

24:01.106 --> 24:03.140
Like there's a beam of energy
coming out of your chest.

24:03.174 --> 24:05.943
I don't think I'm trying
to be a superhero here.

24:05.977 --> 24:07.176
I just want a job.

24:07.211 --> 24:08.845
okay, now, get up,

24:08.879 --> 24:10.346
And let's do it from the beginning.

24:10.381 --> 24:13.482
Oh. It's my turn.

24:13.516 --> 24:15.150
Okay. You ready for this?

24:15.184 --> 24:17.352
I am so ready. -

24:17.387 --> 24:20.221
- Walk tall.
- Walking tall.

24:29.630 --> 24:31.464
That's my resume, sir.

24:31.499 --> 24:33.999
So, mr. Riggins,

24:34.034 --> 24:36.135
I understand you're applying for a job here.

24:36.169 --> 24:39.904
What kind of situation are you looking for?

24:39.938 --> 24:43.408
I'm looking for a situation
where I can achieve something,

24:43.442 --> 24:45.109
Be proud of it,

24:45.144 --> 24:48.011
And do it, start to finish,

24:48.046 --> 24:50.347
On my own.

24:52.150 --> 24:53.916
You know what I think?

24:53.950 --> 24:56.018
What?

24:56.053 --> 24:57.620
I think you're a strong person,

24:57.654 --> 25:00.689
An honest worker,

25:00.723 --> 25:04.592
And I think you can grow up
to be whoever you want to be,

25:04.627 --> 25:05.994
Tim riggins.

25:12.367 --> 25:17.070
I'm guessing that's for you.

25:17.104 --> 25:19.238
What are you doing here?

25:19.273 --> 25:22.474
Just came to talk to tim riggins.

25:22.508 --> 25:25.310
Oh.

25:25.345 --> 25:27.044
- It's for you.
- Yep.

25:27.079 --> 25:29.146
How are you doing?

25:29.181 --> 25:30.715
- Fine.
- Good.

25:33.651 --> 25:37.387
Fours.

25:37.421 --> 25:38.655
What can I do you for?

25:38.689 --> 25:43.659
Um, I got hurt real bad at the farm.

25:43.693 --> 25:45.894
I mean, it's like,
when I push off and when I get hit,

25:45.929 --> 25:49.030
It's like someone's trying to
rip my leg off with a crowbar.

25:49.064 --> 25:51.232
What about the meds the doc gave you?

25:51.266 --> 25:52.767
It's like three weeks of meds.

25:52.801 --> 25:53.767
I went through 'em in one.

25:53.801 --> 25:58.739
All right.

25:58.773 --> 26:00.573
This is what I need you to do, all right?

26:00.607 --> 26:02.208
- Mm-hmm.
- Dr. Cooney.

26:02.242 --> 26:03.576
Mental note this, all right?

26:03.610 --> 26:05.811
When you see him, first thing you got to do,

26:05.846 --> 26:07.579
Tell him how great he was at tmu.

26:07.613 --> 26:09.781
Bring up your hip.
And then there's four questions.

26:09.815 --> 26:11.216
One-word answers.

26:11.250 --> 26:16.220
- Mm-hmm.
- No, no, yes, no.

26:16.254 --> 26:17.521
That's it.

26:17.555 --> 26:20.056
All right. Okay.

26:20.090 --> 26:22.992
well, the joke is on you,

26:23.026 --> 26:26.262
Mr. Kangaroo, for my sword
was dipped in poison.

26:26.296 --> 26:28.096
Okay. Yay! Whoo!

26:28.131 --> 26:29.231
Whoo!

26:29.265 --> 26:30.699
Yay, thanks, landry, for the story.

26:30.733 --> 26:32.367
Now it's bedtime.

26:32.402 --> 26:33.401
What?

26:33.435 --> 26:34.402
Come on.

26:34.436 --> 26:35.736
Now be careful with those swords.

26:35.771 --> 26:36.871
And start the--

26:39.574 --> 26:41.107
You're trying to scare me.

26:41.142 --> 26:42.776
Aren't you gonna kiss?

26:42.810 --> 26:44.611
- Go inside.
- No.

26:44.645 --> 26:45.645
Start the bathwater.

26:45.679 --> 26:47.713
Vince is gonna kick your butt.

26:47.747 --> 26:48.914
He's gonna kick who's butt?

26:48.948 --> 26:50.916
this is gonna be fun!

26:50.950 --> 26:53.418
Jess likes the punter!

26:53.452 --> 26:55.219
She's gonna kiss him!

26:55.254 --> 26:57.088
Smoochy!

26:57.122 --> 26:59.257
What'd he say about vince?

26:59.291 --> 27:03.093
I don't-- I don't know.

27:03.127 --> 27:04.995
I think they like--yeah.

27:05.029 --> 27:07.396
Well, either way,
I had a really good time tonight.

27:10.200 --> 27:11.600
I did too.

27:16.906 --> 27:19.441
I'll see you tomorrow at school.

27:19.475 --> 27:21.108
- Yeah.
- Thanks for the sword.

27:21.142 --> 27:23.644
- Be careful.
- And for the story.

27:23.678 --> 27:25.612
That--thanks.

27:25.647 --> 27:26.913
All right.

27:26.947 --> 27:30.316
Good night.

27:33.085 --> 27:35.187
Yeah.

27:38.191 --> 27:41.959
Well, I got a toy.

27:41.993 --> 27:44.762
All right, it's a vegetarian place,

27:44.796 --> 27:46.362
And it's around here somewhere.

27:46.397 --> 27:47.397
It's supposed to be great.

27:47.431 --> 27:48.898
I read a review about it.

27:48.933 --> 27:51.668
Can't we just go back
and order room service?

27:51.702 --> 27:53.302
What are you talking about?

27:53.336 --> 27:55.404
This is gonna be fun.

27:55.438 --> 27:56.705
I just want to go back.

27:56.739 --> 27:58.240
Hey, hon, come here, come here,

27:58.274 --> 28:00.308
Come here, come here, come here, listen.

28:00.342 --> 28:02.610
I know you're sad about matt leaving,

28:02.644 --> 28:04.245
And I am sorry for that.

28:04.279 --> 28:06.446
But we're here. All right?

28:06.481 --> 28:09.182
This is a great opportunity for you.

28:09.217 --> 28:11.718
I just want to make sure you're
seeing the bigger picture.

28:11.752 --> 28:15.621
I don't know what that big picture is.

28:15.655 --> 28:17.923
It's you. It's your life.

28:17.958 --> 28:19.225
It's your future.

28:19.259 --> 28:21.326
It's getting into the school of your dreams.

28:21.360 --> 28:22.694
You mean the school of your dreams.

28:22.728 --> 28:23.728
Hey.

28:23.762 --> 28:25.997
Stop acting like you're here

28:26.031 --> 28:27.264
Because of me, like I've been

28:27.298 --> 28:29.266
Masterminding your
applications and all that.

28:29.300 --> 28:31.235
No, you've always wanted
to go to a great school

28:31.269 --> 28:32.569
Your whole life.

28:32.604 --> 28:33.836
I am just here to support you.

28:33.871 --> 28:35.371
You get that?

28:35.405 --> 28:37.406
Well, I'm sorry I'm not giving
you the command performance

28:37.441 --> 28:38.808
That you deserve. - Well, you know what?

28:38.842 --> 28:40.075
You've got an opportunity tomorrow.

28:40.109 --> 28:41.910
And you can either show
up and be your best self,

28:43.147 --> 28:44.314
But if you blow it off
because of a break-up,

28:44.348 --> 28:45.348
You are gonna regret that.

28:45.383 --> 28:46.949
So what do you want me to do?

28:46.983 --> 28:48.884
I want you to pull it together, girl.

28:48.918 --> 28:50.452
Yeah, well, I'm trying to
pull it together, okay?

28:50.487 --> 28:52.920
- Well, try harder.
- Try harder?

28:52.955 --> 28:54.689
Yes.

28:57.192 --> 28:58.760
Thanks for your support, mom.

28:58.794 --> 29:01.061
Jules, come-- jules, come here.

29:01.095 --> 29:03.063
Come here. Jules.

29:06.833 --> 29:07.800
<i>- We were assigned a
christmas memory last year,</i>

29:07.834 --> 29:09.335
And, after that, I started reading

29:09.369 --> 29:10.870
All of capote's short stories.

29:10.904 --> 29:12.171
They're really great.

29:12.205 --> 29:13.405
Well, that's impressive.

29:13.439 --> 29:15.340
You know what I think is really amazing?

29:15.374 --> 29:18.043
Is that he and harper lee were best friends.

29:18.077 --> 29:20.411
That, in a little town, two great artists

29:20.445 --> 29:21.612
Found each other when they were kids.

29:21.646 --> 29:24.882
Hmm. I never thought of it that way.

29:24.916 --> 29:27.183
Now, julie,

29:27.217 --> 29:29.252
Is there anything else you
want to say about yourself,

29:29.286 --> 29:32.588
Something that we wouldn't pick
up from reading your transcript?

29:32.623 --> 29:35.590
Um...

29:37.894 --> 29:42.029
When I started high school,

29:42.064 --> 29:44.031
I couldn't wait to get out of dillon.

29:44.066 --> 29:47.567
I thought that every book I
read was like a rung on a ladder

29:47.601 --> 29:49.436
That I built to escape this town

29:49.470 --> 29:52.572
That was all about high school
football and nothing else.

29:55.842 --> 29:59.577
And now that I'm actually
getting close to leaving,

29:59.611 --> 30:02.780
I'm starting to appreciate

30:02.815 --> 30:07.317
That I was shaped by my town,

30:07.351 --> 30:13.055
That I have different viewpoint
than every other person.

30:13.090 --> 30:18.761
I guess what I'm trying to say is that...

30:18.795 --> 30:20.762
I'm surprised by how happy I am

30:20.796 --> 30:24.532
To be from where I'm from.

30:24.567 --> 30:26.366
Does that make any sense?

30:27.936 --> 30:29.870
Yes, it does.

30:33.173 --> 30:34.807
Thanks for coming in.

30:34.841 --> 30:36.442
Well, I appreciate you taking the meeting.

30:36.476 --> 30:38.110
- Absolutely.
- Great.

30:38.145 --> 30:39.978
So anything you want to
add before we're done?

30:40.012 --> 30:41.713
- Resume seems pretty up
-to-date

30:41.747 --> 30:44.549
And, I mean, the state
champ's on there and stuff.

30:44.584 --> 30:45.717
Yeah. Hey, that was impressive, man.

30:45.751 --> 30:47.518
I know I could really come

30:47.552 --> 30:50.087
Into this kind of workplace and
have a sense of achievement.

30:50.121 --> 30:52.323
Well, tim, I think you'd be a good fit here.

30:52.357 --> 30:55.258
- Awesome. Great.
- Great.

30:55.292 --> 30:57.860
- Yeah.
- And so we'll be in touch.

30:57.895 --> 31:00.162
Okay.

31:00.196 --> 31:01.330
You take care.

31:01.364 --> 31:04.900
Yeah. You too.

31:15.409 --> 31:20.913
- Hey.
- Hi.

31:20.947 --> 31:22.414
So?

31:22.449 --> 31:24.483
Is that you asking me how it went?

31:24.517 --> 31:26.217
I mean, you know,

31:26.252 --> 31:27.652
I'm not pressuring you.

31:27.686 --> 31:29.621
You tell me if you want to tell me.

31:29.655 --> 31:31.256
It went well.

31:31.290 --> 31:34.391
Good.

31:34.425 --> 31:37.961
Actually, it went great.

31:37.996 --> 31:40.463
And I went in there,
and I totally kicked ass.

31:43.533 --> 31:44.934
Oh.

31:44.968 --> 31:48.703
Oh, I'm so proud of you.

31:48.738 --> 31:50.138
But you know what, hon?

31:50.172 --> 31:52.973
You know I'd be proud of
you no matter what, right?

31:53.008 --> 31:54.108
I know.

31:54.142 --> 31:56.644
And this whole thing about the fact

31:56.678 --> 31:58.112
That I applied to this school--

31:58.146 --> 31:59.712
I know, I know. It's your dream.

31:59.747 --> 32:01.714
No, honey, honey, that's the thing.

32:01.749 --> 32:04.183
I got my dream.

32:04.218 --> 32:06.184
I went to a good school,

32:06.219 --> 32:07.753
I got the degree I wanted,

32:07.787 --> 32:10.188
I met your dad,

32:10.223 --> 32:12.590
And I had you.

32:12.624 --> 32:14.158
You're my dream, baby.

32:15.994 --> 32:17.561
I got what I wanted.

32:17.596 --> 32:20.263
I got it all.

32:21.932 --> 32:25.901
And now it's your job to
dream up whatever you want,

32:25.935 --> 32:30.339
And I will support you to the
ends of the earth to do that.

32:36.779 --> 32:38.179
Our plane's not till tonight.

32:38.213 --> 32:40.614
We could go-- go to a museum

32:40.648 --> 32:44.284
Or go get a hot fudge sundae and celebrate.

32:44.319 --> 32:49.722
Could we just go home?

32:49.756 --> 32:53.258
Sure we can, sweetie.

33:01.299 --> 33:03.667
You allergic to any medication?

33:03.702 --> 33:04.902
No.

33:04.936 --> 33:06.169
Use alcohol?

33:06.203 --> 33:07.904
No.

33:07.938 --> 33:10.640
You ever try any ove
r-the-counter medications?

33:10.674 --> 33:12.774
Yes.

33:12.809 --> 33:14.009
They do any good for the pain?

33:14.043 --> 33:16.311
- No.
- Hmm.

33:18.548 --> 33:20.781
Who's gonna win the bcs?

33:20.816 --> 33:22.516
Tmu, sir.

33:25.220 --> 33:27.120
At least your head's in the right spot.

33:27.154 --> 33:28.621
Here you go.

33:28.656 --> 33:29.989
Thank you very much.

33:30.024 --> 33:31.157
- Good luck tonight.
- Yes, sir.

33:31.192 --> 33:33.058
They said I came close,

33:33.093 --> 33:35.994
Whatever that means.

33:36.029 --> 33:39.497
And they'll--they'll, of course,
keep the resume close by.

33:39.531 --> 33:40.965
So you never know.

33:40.999 --> 33:45.236
There's no accounting for taste.

33:45.270 --> 33:46.770
That's what my mom always says.

33:46.804 --> 33:50.207
I've heard that a few times myself.

33:55.212 --> 33:57.847
So this is it, huh?

34:02.818 --> 34:04.953
This is it.

34:04.987 --> 34:06.387
It's beautiful.

34:06.421 --> 34:08.222
You know what?

34:08.255 --> 34:10.891
I didn't want that job anyways.

34:13.327 --> 34:16.529
See those trees right there?

34:16.563 --> 34:17.730
That little ridge?

34:17.764 --> 34:19.231
That's where the house is gonna go.

34:19.264 --> 34:20.532
And then I want that deck

34:20.565 --> 34:22.134
That goes all the way around.

34:22.168 --> 34:23.201
- A wraparound.
- Yeah.

34:23.235 --> 34:25.170
Maybe even a little guest house.

34:25.204 --> 34:26.337
You never know.

34:26.371 --> 34:27.938
You see the tree line right there,

34:27.973 --> 34:30.174
I mean, I've walked this
property a few times,

34:30.208 --> 34:34.476
And it goes way, way beyond that.

34:34.512 --> 34:36.713
It's endless.

34:39.181 --> 34:42.885
I wanted to--

34:42.918 --> 34:48.089
I wanted to thank you...

34:48.123 --> 34:52.025
For helping me with...

34:52.060 --> 34:54.895
The process.

34:54.929 --> 34:58.732
So thank you.

35:17.282 --> 35:19.415
I'm sorry.

35:38.467 --> 35:39.432
Welcome, folks, and all the fans

35:39.467 --> 35:40.667
Of the east dillon lions.

35:40.701 --> 35:43.636
We invite you tonight to the radio debut

35:43.671 --> 35:47.206
Of lions football on 1040 a.M., el fuego.

35:47.240 --> 35:49.208
Now over to my partner

35:49.242 --> 35:51.443
And your play-by-play man willie gault.

35:51.478 --> 35:52.643
Thank you, buddy garrity,

35:52.678 --> 35:54.412
And thank you to all you fans who tuned in

35:54.446 --> 35:56.347
To hear a game that has been given

35:56.381 --> 35:58.015
A very special billing--

35:58.050 --> 35:59.216
The toilet bowl.

35:59.250 --> 36:01.818
One, two, three! All: Lions!

36:01.853 --> 36:09.124
* *

36:09.159 --> 36:10.392
Oh!

36:17.199 --> 36:19.132
Go! Go! Go!

36:25.506 --> 36:27.974
There's the snap. Looking left.

36:28.008 --> 36:30.142
He cuts up the middle.

36:30.177 --> 36:31.911
Too late. Makes a move.

36:33.613 --> 36:36.548
Touchdown! - There we go.

36:38.551 --> 36:40.651
And the lions draw first blood.

36:40.685 --> 36:41.986
What an impressive first series

36:42.020 --> 36:44.188
That coach eric taylor

36:44.222 --> 36:45.855
Has designed here in east dillon tonight.

36:45.890 --> 36:47.090
Yeah!

36:47.124 --> 36:49.425
I tell you what, vince howard is gunned up,

36:49.460 --> 36:50.827
He is yoked up, and he is playing

36:50.861 --> 36:54.329
Like he's been playing
quarterback his whole life.

36:54.364 --> 36:56.198
And this touchdown was brought to you

36:56.232 --> 37:00.034
By el amigo restaurant.

37:00.068 --> 37:05.672
* *

37:05.706 --> 37:08.909
Vince howard comes back out in the spread.

37:08.943 --> 37:11.545
He's got his a back setup in the slot.

37:11.579 --> 37:15.047
Rolling right to throw back.

37:15.081 --> 37:19.584
* *

37:19.618 --> 37:23.454
Oh! Beautiful pass!

37:26.925 --> 37:29.359
Oh, he overthrew him. It's incomplete.

37:30.795 --> 37:32.061
Would you look at the gun on that kid?

37:32.095 --> 37:34.864
Howard has just thrown the ball

37:34.898 --> 37:35.898
It looks like 60 yards, willie.

37:35.933 --> 37:38.034
It seems like inexperience

37:38.068 --> 37:39.401
Finally caught up with young howard.

37:39.435 --> 37:40.535
Landry!

37:40.570 --> 37:41.703
Field goal.

37:41.737 --> 37:43.371
But it's on the 25 yard line.

37:43.406 --> 37:44.806
Just go kick the damn thing.

37:44.840 --> 37:46.373
go, landry, go!

37:51.246 --> 37:52.745
* *

38:03.990 --> 38:05.389
Ladies and gentlemen,

38:05.424 --> 38:08.292
Landry clarke has hit a 42-yard field goal.

38:08.327 --> 38:10.628
East dillon lions go into halftime

38:10.662 --> 38:12.762
With a 17 to 7 lead.

38:33.081 --> 38:36.049
You scared the crap out of me.

38:36.084 --> 38:38.784
What's with the monkey suit?

38:51.097 --> 38:53.897
How much money are we talking about?

38:53.932 --> 38:58.501
Tim.

38:58.535 --> 39:01.004
I don't want you involved in this.

39:01.038 --> 39:02.338
How much?

39:06.309 --> 39:07.876
You'll make more money in two months

39:07.910 --> 39:09.578
Than you could in two years.

39:09.612 --> 39:11.846
Two months?

39:11.880 --> 39:14.315
Two months max.

39:25.059 --> 39:27.092
- It's 17
-7, east dillon,

39:27.127 --> 39:29.328
And the way the lions
have been playing tonight,

39:29.362 --> 39:31.363
I hope coach taylor just lets 'em play.

39:31.398 --> 39:32.597
All right, go on one. Ready? All: Break.

39:32.631 --> 39:33.898
Howard over center.

39:33.932 --> 39:34.932
There's your snap.

39:34.967 --> 39:36.267
He's looking left.

39:36.301 --> 39:38.102
Under pressure, throws the ball.

39:38.137 --> 39:39.102
Oh, it's picked off!

39:39.137 --> 39:41.438
Oh, what are you doing?

39:41.472 --> 39:43.940
Timberwolves have it. Going the other way!

39:43.975 --> 39:47.276
The pack on the move.
Touchdown, timberwolves.

39:51.648 --> 39:53.348
You know what,

39:53.382 --> 39:55.784
A good quarterback's got a short memory.

39:58.020 --> 40:03.991
* *

40:04.025 --> 40:05.425
Cafferty's looking for a place to go.

40:05.459 --> 40:06.659
There's nowhere to run.

40:06.694 --> 40:09.028
And cafferty gets swarmed
by the timberwolf team.

40:09.063 --> 40:11.697
- Come on!
- Oh, my, fumble!

40:11.731 --> 40:14.066
Campo picks it up.
Looks like reservations for six.

40:14.100 --> 40:15.467
Touchdown, timberwolves!

40:16.936 --> 40:19.370
Another timberwolf touchdown.

40:19.404 --> 40:20.805
This cannot be.

40:20.839 --> 40:22.206
The lions have squandered their lead.

40:22.240 --> 40:23.240
Now how did this happen?

40:23.275 --> 40:25.041
I think I'm gonna be sick, willie.

40:27.011 --> 40:31.647
let's go, lions, let's go!

40:31.681 --> 40:39.687
* *

41:04.043 --> 41:06.243
Hey, hey, time out. Time.

41:06.277 --> 41:08.512
Hey, you all right? - Yeah, I'm fine.

41:08.546 --> 41:10.080
You all right till next series?

41:10.115 --> 41:11.381
Yeah. Let's go. Yes, sir.

41:11.416 --> 41:12.548
- Okay.
- Let's do it.

41:12.583 --> 41:15.251
60 seconds left in the game,

41:15.285 --> 41:17.353
The lions third and goal
from the two-yard line.

41:17.387 --> 41:18.720
Coach taylor out of time-outs.

41:19.755 --> 41:21.155
You know, sometimes, willie,

41:21.189 --> 41:22.823
There are other forces at work.

41:22.858 --> 41:26.159
Damn it, coach taylor
has inspired these boys,

41:26.193 --> 41:27.160
He's worked these boys,

41:27.194 --> 41:29.062
And these boys are a team.

41:29.096 --> 41:35.868
* *

41:40.572 --> 41:41.639
Go, go, go!

41:47.245 --> 41:48.779
Yeah!

41:48.813 --> 41:50.914
The east dillon lions win! We won!

41:50.948 --> 41:52.047
We won a game!

42:00.656 --> 42:01.890
Yeah.

42:01.924 --> 42:09.129
* *

42:12.900 --> 42:15.234
I got to admit,
my man's been insane tonight.

42:15.269 --> 42:17.937
No doubt.

42:24.277 --> 42:28.078
I'll see you later.

42:28.113 --> 42:31.115
Hey, landry! - Hey there.
