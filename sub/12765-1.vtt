00:02.310 --> 00:06.070
When you first came here,
everything in the world was new.

00:06.080 --> 00:07.290
Look at all you've learned.

00:07.320 --> 00:08.650
Look at all you've overcome.

00:08.670 --> 00:10.090
Tonight's a celebration of that.

00:10.120 --> 00:11.630
Just breathe and enjoy it.

00:11.650 --> 00:12.570
Don't use this.

00:12.590 --> 00:14.130
You don't want me to have safe sex?

00:14.140 --> 00:17.990
I do want you to have safe sex, but
I don't want you to have sex at all.

00:18.010 --> 00:20.080
I really wanted to have
sex with you tonight.

00:20.100 --> 00:21.950
I just don't think we should.

00:21.980 --> 00:27.040
Losing my virginity on prom night is
the most cliché of all things cliché.

00:27.050 --> 00:32.380
This song is written by someone who
knows a lot more about who she is

00:32.390 --> 00:35.890
and what life's all about
than she will ever admit.

00:35.910 --> 00:39.300
I don't know where you stand with me, or
with what we're supposed to be or not be,

00:39.310 --> 00:41.060
but it's in your hands.

00:41.070 --> 00:43.820
I think that means we
shouldn't be together.

00:44.200 --> 00:45.420
I think we should leave Seattle.

00:45.430 --> 00:48.590
- Where would we go?
- Somewhere. Anywhere else.

00:48.600 --> 00:50.580
I'm gonna miss you, Jessi.

00:50.600 --> 00:51.640
No, you're not.

00:51.680 --> 00:55.040
Because no matter where I'm,
we're always connected.

00:56.540 --> 00:58.120
The people in Latnok aren't bad.

00:58.140 --> 01:01.310
They're simply scientists with
a very clinical point of view.

01:01.330 --> 01:02.610
He's incredible.

01:02.640 --> 01:04.330
I think it's time we
introduce ourselves.

01:04.360 --> 01:06.860
- I love you.
- I love you, too.

01:06.870 --> 01:09.630
Oh, I left my other clothes inside.

01:09.650 --> 01:11.480
I'll get them.

01:14.250 --> 01:16.600
- Got everything you need?
- I do now.

01:39.330 --> 01:41.500
Amanda?

02:13.370 --> 02:15.100
Put him under.

02:17.030 --> 02:18.980
Amanda...

02:41.180 --> 02:44.370
Though we like to believe
we have control of our lives,

02:44.380 --> 02:48.320
in a single moment,
everything can change.

02:48.330 --> 02:54.330
My night of celebration had suddenly
turned, leaving me afraid and confused.

03:15.510 --> 03:16.940
I was trapped.

03:16.960 --> 03:21.260
And the only thing on my
mind was "where was Amanda?"

03:33.060 --> 03:35.550
<font color=#00FFFF>Season 3 Episode 1: 
It Happened One Night</font>

03:39.080 --> 03:41.550
Oh, the pain.

03:41.560 --> 03:44.110
Broken heart, broken feet.

03:44.120 --> 03:44.920
Broken heart?

03:44.930 --> 03:46.000
She dumped Declan.

03:46.010 --> 03:48.650
Dumped is inaccurate. We weren't
an official couple anymore.

03:48.660 --> 03:49.730
What happened?

03:49.750 --> 03:54.150
Let's just say he very graciously
gave me the opportunity to move on.

03:55.390 --> 03:57.720
Which I took.

03:58.010 --> 04:00.170
Really.

04:01.430 --> 04:03.010
I'm going to sleep.

04:03.020 --> 04:05.020
What about the after-party?

04:05.030 --> 04:07.630
Give my regards to Andy
and the dimple twins.

04:07.640 --> 04:09.270
Where are Kyle and Amanda?

04:09.280 --> 04:11.100
They went straight to the hotel,

04:11.120 --> 04:13.190
which would sound a whole lot
hotter for any other couple.

04:13.200 --> 04:15.200
Wait a minute, what about
You? How was your night?

04:15.210 --> 04:16.950
Dad, I have to swap
clothes and meet Andy.

04:16.970 --> 04:20.180
I know, but anything...
exciting to report?

04:20.190 --> 04:22.550
If you're asking me about that...

04:22.570 --> 04:24.500
candy bar you gave me, no worries.

04:24.510 --> 04:25.540
It's still in the wrapper.

04:25.550 --> 04:28.710
Josh, I know your
father gave you a condom.

04:31.160 --> 04:32.720
Is there nothing sacred in this house?

04:32.750 --> 04:34.770
I didn't mean to embarrass you.

04:34.780 --> 04:36.290
But since we're on the subject...

04:36.310 --> 04:41.330
rest assured, nothing remotely
life-altering awaits me at the after-party.

04:41.340 --> 04:44.660
Even Kyle's got a better
shot at some excitement.

04:51.260 --> 04:53.400
I couldn't search for Amanda.

04:53.420 --> 04:56.070
So I listened for her heartbeat.

04:58.330 --> 05:01.870
But I could only hear
voices talking about me.

05:01.880 --> 05:03.950
He's non-responsive.

05:03.960 --> 05:06.710
Tell them he's ready
to begin the procedure.

05:42.360 --> 05:45.330
Brutus! Come here! Come here!

05:53.670 --> 05:56.000
How did you do that?

05:56.010 --> 05:58.370
It's just a dog.

05:59.310 --> 06:02.670
I hope he, uh, I hope he
didn't send you packing.

06:03.610 --> 06:07.430
All the barking. It's a new
place. He gets kind of jittery.

06:07.440 --> 06:11.090
No, we didn't hear
anything. We're just leaving.

06:11.100 --> 06:12.720
We?

06:12.750 --> 06:14.940
Uh, me and my mother.

06:14.950 --> 06:17.540
You and your mom. Cool.

06:17.970 --> 06:20.860
Vacation or...

06:22.040 --> 06:25.690
incredibly nosy. I'm so sorry.

06:27.990 --> 06:31.320
Well, my laundry awaits,
so I'm gonna get back to it.

06:32.790 --> 06:35.490
Cool.

06:38.890 --> 06:41.900
When's a good time to use the machine?

06:42.990 --> 06:44.750
The washing machine.

06:44.760 --> 06:46.900
After midnight.

06:46.920 --> 06:49.090
Good to know. Cool.

06:50.450 --> 06:52.770
Have a good night.

06:53.210 --> 06:55.730
You too.

07:01.220 --> 07:03.460
You know, we could
just hang out at home.

07:03.480 --> 07:05.510
This is all part of the
post-prom experience.

07:05.540 --> 07:09.180
Ok, just don't act all excited
and weird. Try to fit in.

07:11.550 --> 07:13.380
How hard can that be?

07:13.390 --> 07:15.560
Is it hot in here?

07:15.570 --> 07:17.750
Like the surface of the sun.

07:22.340 --> 07:25.560
Maybe we should just surrender
and rip off all our clothes.

07:26.830 --> 07:28.970
- Grapefruit.
- What?

07:29.220 --> 07:31.300
Nothing.

07:41.490 --> 07:44.340
G-Force is the answer.

07:46.720 --> 07:48.080
Come here.

07:48.090 --> 07:50.130
Keep it together.

07:51.900 --> 07:54.470
Wardrobe change. Much more comfortable.

07:54.480 --> 07:56.870
Are you ready for some bubbly?

07:56.880 --> 07:57.990
Where'd you get that?

07:58.010 --> 08:03.180
Compliments of the caterer, in exchange for
a five-star review of his bistro on my blog.

08:03.190 --> 08:05.660
You know, Trager hates champagne.

08:05.670 --> 08:07.810
It makes her nose tickle.

08:08.100 --> 08:10.990
Which is... actually kind of cute.

08:11.310 --> 08:13.870
But I shouldn't be
thinking about that, right?

08:13.890 --> 08:15.900
I should be bouncing back.

08:15.920 --> 08:17.660
Bounce away, most definitely.

08:17.680 --> 08:18.990
I should be having fun.

08:19.010 --> 08:21.000
Mindless fun, that is the goal.

08:21.010 --> 08:22.240
What should we toast to?

08:22.250 --> 08:24.620
To hangovers.

08:28.640 --> 08:31.120
- Is that everything?
- Yeah.

08:31.640 --> 08:34.799
I guess everything I
own fits in one bag.

08:35.720 --> 08:38.200
It's good to travel light.

08:44.430 --> 08:47.690
Jessi? What is it?

08:48.310 --> 08:51.080
I don't know. I think there's
something wrong with Kyle.

08:51.090 --> 08:53.770
You're just anxious about leaving.

08:53.780 --> 08:56.580
No, he's in trouble. I can feel it.

08:56.590 --> 08:58.910
Jessi.

08:58.920 --> 09:01.940
I know this is hard
and scary. For me, too.

09:01.950 --> 09:04.740
You're gonna feel better
once we get on the road.

09:04.760 --> 09:07.080
I can't leave.

09:07.090 --> 09:11.390
We have to get away from all this,
Jessi. We have to start our new life.

09:11.400 --> 09:13.010
Not until I see him.

09:13.030 --> 09:14.790
Please get in the car.

09:15.150 --> 09:17.400
No.

09:19.260 --> 09:21.560
I'll be back.

09:57.460 --> 09:59.300
Get him!

10:10.740 --> 10:12.850
There's nowhere to run.

10:13.620 --> 10:15.390
Get him!

10:31.290 --> 10:33.620
Faster, Josh. Don't stop.

10:33.630 --> 10:36.610
Almost there, almost...

10:37.760 --> 10:39.070
Lost it.

10:39.080 --> 10:41.540
Hey, I was hitting that little
button as fast as I could.

10:41.560 --> 10:43.440
You gotta keep hitting that, Trager.

10:43.460 --> 10:45.950
It sounds gross when you
"Trager" me. Please don't.

10:45.960 --> 10:48.410
We need more whipped cream.

10:49.180 --> 10:50.690
Whipped cream, huh?

10:50.700 --> 10:52.540
Looks like your night's
going good, Trager.

10:52.570 --> 10:55.410
The whipped cream, unfortunately,
is destined for the sundaes.

10:55.440 --> 10:56.400
How come?

10:56.410 --> 10:59.200
My prom night's turned
out to be totally G-rated experience.

10:59.230 --> 11:00.600
And you were hoping for an R.

11:00.610 --> 11:02.850
At least.

11:02.880 --> 11:07.290
I wanna... you know,
badly. Really, really badly.

11:07.300 --> 11:10.930
And sometimes I think she does too,
because she says these things...

11:10.940 --> 11:14.080
so what's the problem?

11:14.490 --> 11:20.320
In a moment of colossal stupidity, I
panicked and told her I'm not ready for sex.

11:20.350 --> 11:21.500
But now...

11:21.520 --> 11:23.790
you want to know how to proceed?

11:23.800 --> 11:26.700
Here's what you do.
Forget about tonight.

11:26.710 --> 11:31.760
You killed the mood, torpedoed your own sub,
kicked the lock shut on her chastity belt.

11:33.150 --> 11:35.360
What are you talking about?

11:35.380 --> 11:37.490
Was that even advice?

11:37.500 --> 11:40.970
The truth hurts. Later, Trager.

11:41.490 --> 11:44.160
Dude, quit saying that!

11:55.870 --> 12:01.730
I hoped that somehow Amanda was home, that
she hadn't been part of what happened to me.

12:19.950 --> 12:22.730
I couldn't hear Amanda's heartbeat.

12:26.030 --> 12:29.560
I had to check her room to
know for sure she wasn't there.

13:01.200 --> 13:02.700
I come bearing chamomile.

13:02.710 --> 13:04.950
I thought it might help you sleep.

13:05.260 --> 13:07.970
You just poured me a cup downstairs.

13:09.550 --> 13:11.880
Mom, you don't need an
excuse to come check on me.

13:11.890 --> 13:14.880
Too obvious? So?

13:17.100 --> 13:18.960
I'm fine.

13:18.990 --> 13:22.690
I mean, I know life with
Declan has been a total seesaw.

13:23.370 --> 13:26.330
But it's finally really over.

13:26.810 --> 13:29.800
And I can never go back to him.

13:29.810 --> 13:33.050
And I don't want to. I don't think.

13:35.370 --> 13:37.910
Did I just make a huge mistake?

13:38.180 --> 13:42.770
Declan's been your safety net,
and it's scary to be on your own.

13:45.290 --> 13:50.180
Actually, I kind of
already like somebody else.

13:50.190 --> 13:52.760
Who?

13:52.960 --> 13:55.600
- Kyle?
- Kyle?

14:05.480 --> 14:08.740
She wasn't in her room, and I told
mrs. Bloom she'd be home by 3:00.

14:08.750 --> 14:11.060
What if Latnok took her?

14:12.590 --> 14:13.640
What are you doing?

14:13.650 --> 14:14.970
I'm calling the police.

14:14.990 --> 14:16.410
Mom, and tell them what?

14:16.450 --> 14:17.500
Amanda is missing.

14:17.520 --> 14:19.080
And how is that conversation gonna go?

14:19.100 --> 14:22.430
Oh, hi, 911? My adopted son,
the one with no bellybutton?

14:22.440 --> 14:24.020
I think his prom date was abducted.

14:24.050 --> 14:25.160
I see your point.

14:25.180 --> 14:25.930
I can't just sit here.

14:25.970 --> 14:27.510
Any place she might have gone?

14:27.520 --> 14:29.870
We were going to the after-party. I
don't think she'd leave without me.

14:29.880 --> 14:32.870
- We should still check.
- Josh is there.

14:33.150 --> 14:35.580
- Let's not involve him just yet.
- I'll go.

14:35.590 --> 14:38.620
Even if Amanda's not there, I
can ask if somebody saw anything.

14:38.630 --> 14:40.980
- Thank you.
- We'll find her.

14:44.390 --> 14:46.800
- My phone...
- You left it here.

14:49.370 --> 14:51.630
It's a text from Amanda.

14:57.570 --> 14:59.680
Latnok.

14:59.700 --> 15:02.100
They have her.

15:07.130 --> 15:07.880
Where are you going?

15:07.910 --> 15:09.020
To check out that building.

15:09.030 --> 15:10.460
- I'll go with you.
- We both will.

15:10.470 --> 15:12.310
No.

15:42.590 --> 15:47.210
I returned to the building where they
had kept me, expecting to find Amanda.

15:48.570 --> 15:54.120
I didn't know who I'd come up against, but I was
prepared to do whatever was necessary to save her.

15:56.800 --> 15:59.560
But she wasn't there.

16:00.730 --> 16:03.570
Everything...

16:03.580 --> 16:06.230
and everyone...

16:06.770 --> 16:09.200
was gone.

16:37.610 --> 16:39.140
Jessi?

16:40.810 --> 16:42.390
Amanda?

16:42.420 --> 16:45.110
Has anyone seen Amanda Bloom?

16:46.600 --> 16:47.650
Has anyone seen Amanda Bloom?

16:47.680 --> 16:52.570
Sweet blonde girl, probably the
one assigning designated drivers.

16:59.590 --> 17:01.850
So you came after all.

17:01.860 --> 17:06.069
If you were already feeling like a loser,
probably should have re-thunk the outfit.

17:06.079 --> 17:07.990
Ignoring you. Have
you seen Amanda around?

17:08.000 --> 17:11.270
Yeah, she's been doing jell-o shots
and swinging on a stripper's pole.

17:11.829 --> 17:14.200
- No, why?
- Is something wrong?

17:14.210 --> 17:16.630
Oh, no. God, no. Carry on.

17:22.410 --> 17:25.280
This shampoo smells like her hair.

17:25.290 --> 17:28.990
What are the chances that Trager's
shampoo would be in this hotel?

17:29.000 --> 17:32.150
Damn this shampoo, it's mocking me!

17:32.170 --> 17:36.450
Nugget, that is generic hotel shampoo.

17:36.460 --> 17:39.780
Definitely not something
Lori Trager would use.

17:40.520 --> 17:44.850
And this is exactly why I can't
allow you to wallow in here alone.

17:46.010 --> 17:47.090
There's room for two.

17:47.130 --> 17:48.740
Get up and let's go back to the party.

17:48.760 --> 17:51.270
Don't think so!

17:51.280 --> 17:53.030
There's bubble bath.

17:53.050 --> 17:55.320
Not in this dress, muffin.

17:57.130 --> 17:58.800
Sorry.

18:01.620 --> 18:02.340
Carol.

18:02.350 --> 18:08.560
I'm next door at the Tragers, so if you cannot
reach me on my cell then try calling me here.

18:09.460 --> 18:11.730
Do you have any idea what time it is?

18:11.740 --> 18:12.890
Almost 1:00?

18:12.910 --> 18:18.460
Oh, yes. You say that so calmly, as if your
children are commonly out until all hours.

18:18.470 --> 18:19.890
Well, it is prom night.

18:19.920 --> 18:25.120
I understand that, but Amanda said she would check
in at midnight and I have not heard from her yet.

18:25.130 --> 18:28.430
I've been calling and calling,
and she doesn't answer.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.260
Well, everyone's at the after-party.

18:30.290 --> 18:32.880
It's probably so loud
she can't hear her phone.

18:32.910 --> 18:34.830
What after-party? Where is that?

18:37.050 --> 18:38.540
- Why?
- Why?

18:38.550 --> 18:39.930
Because I have to go there.

18:39.940 --> 18:42.020
No, Carol, no. I mean, please.

18:42.030 --> 18:43.580
We're talking about Kyle and Amanda.

18:43.610 --> 18:46.400
We don't have anything to worry about.

18:46.410 --> 18:48.000
Let the kids have their fun.

18:48.030 --> 18:51.150
I understand that you are very
loose with your children, Nicole,

18:51.170 --> 18:55.510
but I need to see for myself exactly
what kind of fun they are having.

18:55.540 --> 19:00.010
But Stephen and I would love it
if you would stay here with us.

19:00.020 --> 19:01.010
With us?

19:01.030 --> 19:04.210
Of course. We're waiting up, too.

19:04.220 --> 19:07.690
In fact, we were just about
to crack open a bottle of wine.

19:08.080 --> 19:10.510
Carol, red or white?
What's your pleasure?

19:10.820 --> 19:13.250
You know, I don't partake... ordinarily.

19:13.260 --> 19:17.160
But yes, I do think a little
something just to help calm my nerves.

19:17.190 --> 19:19.790
Nice Shiraz would be divine.

19:21.860 --> 19:23.450
Jessi, I don't want you getting involved.

19:23.460 --> 19:24.550
Well, it's too late.

19:24.560 --> 19:27.130
Besides, how many
times have you saved me?

19:27.140 --> 19:29.510
I owe you a few.

19:31.460 --> 19:32.770
Where would they have taken her?

19:32.800 --> 19:35.060
Why would they want her?

19:43.460 --> 19:47.000
It's all we've got, and I can't wait
around for them to contact me again.

19:47.010 --> 19:50.070
- What... trace her cell.
- It's turned off.

19:54.870 --> 19:57.810
Wait, you already know
when this message was sent.

19:58.220 --> 20:00.330
And I know what time we left the prom.

20:00.360 --> 20:02.660
Assuming they took Amanda straight
from the school to where she is...

20:02.680 --> 20:03.890
Are you thinking what I'm thinking?

20:03.920 --> 20:06.590
A radial tracking map.

20:24.510 --> 20:26.040
Lori Trager.

20:26.050 --> 20:29.120
Hey, did you see Amanda
after the... Wait.

20:29.130 --> 20:31.860
Am I in your cell?
Have you programmed me?

20:32.660 --> 20:34.530
Uh, what did you say about Amanda?

20:35.490 --> 20:38.120
Did you see her and Kyle after the prom?

20:38.140 --> 20:41.650
Yeah, he came into the gym and grabbed
something. I didn't see her. No, why?

20:42.140 --> 20:44.320
She borrowed my lip gloss.

20:44.340 --> 20:46.620
Well, this is an emergency.

20:47.000 --> 20:49.560
You must need it for the after-party.

20:49.580 --> 20:52.290
- Actually, I'd rather be home.
- Home?

20:52.300 --> 20:54.730
Or you know... somewhere.

20:54.740 --> 20:58.100
Somewhere... where?

20:59.200 --> 21:01.520
I gotta go.

21:03.120 --> 21:05.490
Booze is just a band-aid
for a broken heart.

21:05.500 --> 21:07.840
What you need is a hot
and sweaty mack session.

21:07.860 --> 21:09.550
- With who?
- Who cares?

21:09.560 --> 21:12.100
As long as she's the anti-Lori Trager.

21:12.110 --> 21:14.800
So just go out there, find a girl...

21:14.830 --> 21:16.490
preferably a hot one.

21:16.510 --> 21:19.040
But with your beer
goggles it may not matter.

21:19.070 --> 21:23.110
Find her, and grab her,
and just rebound. Simple.

21:23.120 --> 21:25.380
Simple.

21:28.890 --> 21:31.890
Oh, my god. Oh, my god!

21:31.900 --> 21:35.690
No! No... he's drunk and I got wet.

21:35.700 --> 21:38.040
That's ok. Stop there.
Uh, have you seen Amanda?

21:38.050 --> 21:39.270
Best guess, she's with Kyle.

21:39.280 --> 21:40.420
Not so much, no.

21:40.450 --> 21:41.310
I can help you look.

21:41.330 --> 21:44.400
No, that's ok. Go back
to your bathroom fiesta.

21:44.410 --> 21:46.580
Lori!

21:46.910 --> 21:48.960
Here's beachwood high.

21:48.970 --> 21:51.160
If their best speed through
the city was 30 miles an hour,

21:51.180 --> 21:53.040
this is the Northest
they could have traveled.

21:53.060 --> 21:54.780
Right.

21:54.810 --> 21:57.100
We need to narrow it down.

21:59.560 --> 22:02.010
Looks like the back wall is curved.

22:02.020 --> 22:04.530
Maybe it's some sort of round building?

22:05.270 --> 22:08.020
Here, play the sound.

22:09.130 --> 22:11.280
Is that a foghorn?

22:11.310 --> 22:13.780
I can make it louder.

22:19.760 --> 22:21.900
What's that popping noise?

22:21.910 --> 22:24.120
A train.

22:24.130 --> 22:27.600
It's not a foghorn. It's a train
horn at a railroad crossing.

22:27.610 --> 22:31.350
If we can find that, we can find her.

22:36.340 --> 22:40.450
That's 350 points fob Carol. I guess
that makes you the winner. Again.

22:41.740 --> 22:45.220
I would have never taken
you two for word buzzers.

22:46.620 --> 22:48.240
Shall we play again?

22:48.250 --> 22:51.010
I think I'm all buzzed out.

22:51.140 --> 22:51.920
Hello?

22:51.950 --> 22:53.760
I haven't found her
but I need your help.

22:53.780 --> 22:55.890
Can you log on to View-it earth?

23:00.550 --> 23:02.890
Hang on.

23:03.370 --> 23:06.290
Who on earth would be
calling at this hour?

23:06.570 --> 23:07.830
Work.

23:07.840 --> 23:11.920
We need a cylindrical building,
maybe some sort of silo,

23:11.940 --> 23:15.880
within 200 feet of the railroad tracks,
and somewhere between Cedar and Blanchard.

23:15.910 --> 23:18.160
I'm looking.

23:19.670 --> 23:22.540
A 3:00 am curfew. What was I thinking?

23:27.550 --> 23:31.110
Looks like something on the
corner of 5th and Dexter.

23:31.120 --> 23:32.550
Thank you.

23:32.560 --> 23:37.420
Ok, so I was all up and through that
after-prom, and no one has seen Amanda...

23:39.050 --> 23:41.550
dancing like that.

23:41.580 --> 23:46.850
She and Kyle are just... just dancing.

23:46.860 --> 23:50.880
A respectable distance from each
other, having an awesome time.

23:52.000 --> 23:55.030
Well, shall we pop another?

23:55.040 --> 23:57.650
- I'm awfully parched.
- Sure.

24:06.770 --> 24:08.800
How do we get in?

24:08.820 --> 24:11.240
We'll have to wait until
they go back inside.

24:11.260 --> 24:13.980
This could take awhile.

24:14.790 --> 24:16.340
We'll slip past them.

24:16.370 --> 24:18.490
No, they'll see us.

24:18.500 --> 24:21.160
No, they won't.

24:25.500 --> 24:28.600
Great, now we can't see either.

24:30.500 --> 24:33.360
Enhance your vision.

24:36.970 --> 24:38.790
This is amazing.

24:38.810 --> 24:40.420
You've been holding out on me.

24:40.430 --> 24:42.060
What are you worried about?

24:42.070 --> 24:44.450
I got wasted and I screwed up.

24:44.470 --> 24:46.100
If anything, Lori hates me.

24:46.120 --> 24:47.820
You don't understand.

24:47.840 --> 24:50.800
She's my BFF and your
on-again, off-again.

24:50.830 --> 24:53.760
Yeah, and her and me
are off again for good.

24:53.780 --> 24:54.830
So what does it matter?

24:54.840 --> 24:57.360
It matters, absolutely!

24:57.400 --> 24:59.930
Yes, I may have
transgressed in the past,

24:59.940 --> 25:04.730
but under no circumstances will I
ever hook up with my best friend's ex.

25:05.060 --> 25:07.630
She may have made a major
mistake by rejecting you,

25:07.640 --> 25:11.720
even though you're this incredible guy
that went to great lengths to win her over.

25:11.730 --> 25:16.070
But I will not, cannot
allow myself to like you.

25:16.090 --> 25:18.900
Are we clear?

25:32.840 --> 25:34.420
So what do you think? Wrap it up?

25:34.430 --> 25:38.830
Yeah. I don't have the heart to
kill you any more ways tonight.

25:48.620 --> 25:51.730
The lost puppy dog look. Let me guess.

25:51.740 --> 25:56.560
You're thinking, are we really gonna be that couple
who went to prom and played video games all night?

25:57.580 --> 26:00.250
Maybe. A little.

26:02.170 --> 26:05.070
But only because you look so hot
and everyone else is doing it,

26:05.110 --> 26:09.130
which is not an argument I imagine
you're gonna fly with right now.

26:10.480 --> 26:11.710
Is it?

26:11.740 --> 26:13.410
You're the one who didn't want to.

26:13.430 --> 26:14.360
You didn't want to either.

26:14.390 --> 26:17.060
But you went on the record first.

26:17.330 --> 26:20.010
Total jerk.

26:21.980 --> 26:25.880
So you really did want to? Do you?

26:26.390 --> 26:27.940
Do you?

26:27.950 --> 26:30.760
There are so many arguments against.

26:30.770 --> 26:32.710
I know, the cliché of it all.

26:32.720 --> 26:36.490
There's that. And there's
the what happens after?

26:37.430 --> 26:39.690
I... I just want to get to the during.

26:39.700 --> 26:41.820
Seriously.

26:41.840 --> 26:46.290
Say you have this amazing pair of jeans.

26:46.300 --> 26:50.540
You love them. They feel
great and they hug your ass.

26:50.550 --> 26:53.770
And then you cut them
off to make shorts.

26:53.790 --> 26:56.430
You can't ever get them back.

26:56.440 --> 27:00.750
So... we're the comfortable,
ass-hugging jeans.

27:01.060 --> 27:03.890
But what if we're not great as shorts?

27:03.900 --> 27:05.710
Exactly.

27:05.730 --> 27:12.140
And I would hate myself if I gave up a great
pair of jeans for some sucky, raggedy cut-offs.

27:12.890 --> 27:16.490
I think the jeans are worth cutting so we
could try them on as shorts at least once.

27:16.510 --> 27:18.760
Josh, it'll happen when it's right.

27:18.790 --> 27:22.220
Not because it's prom night
or because we're supposed to,

27:22.250 --> 27:26.290
but when everything comes together in the
moment, we'll feel it. We'll just know.

27:38.730 --> 27:39.990
How will we find her?

27:40.020 --> 27:42.200
I'll hear her heartbeat.

27:50.570 --> 27:52.470
Come on.

27:56.730 --> 27:58.440
- Security to the front gate...
- I'll handle this.

27:58.450 --> 27:59.650
No. Jessi...

27:59.660 --> 28:02.520
- we don't have time to argue.
- Then listen to me.

28:24.450 --> 28:26.370
Next time, we do it my way.

28:26.400 --> 28:27.370
I don't want you to get hurt.

28:27.380 --> 28:29.780
- Don't worry about me.
- Jessi.

28:29.790 --> 28:33.490
If we have to separate, get out
and head straight back to Sarah.

28:33.510 --> 28:35.500
- Kyle...
- Promise me.

28:35.510 --> 28:38.140
I need to know you'll be safe.

28:41.160 --> 28:43.690
I promise.

28:47.860 --> 28:50.560
You kbow, it's only a matter of
time 'till they realize we're here.

28:50.580 --> 28:53.480
And when that happens,
you'll have to fight.

28:53.860 --> 28:56.470
See what I mean?

28:57.120 --> 28:59.750
We do it my way.

29:02.600 --> 29:05.260
No choice.

29:38.840 --> 29:40.290
I like my way better.

29:40.310 --> 29:43.470
I can hear it now. It's Amanda.

29:44.600 --> 29:46.240
Kyle.

29:46.850 --> 29:49.410
- Jessi, go.
- No. I'll be fine.

29:49.420 --> 29:51.820
Go get your prom date.

30:02.360 --> 30:03.340
What do they want from him?

30:03.360 --> 30:06.360
Please... They have a plan.

30:06.370 --> 30:08.380
What plan?

30:08.400 --> 30:10.700
I don't know.

30:51.820 --> 30:54.490
- Amanda!
- Security breach in corridor six.

31:00.330 --> 31:03.240
Security breach in corridor six.

31:06.600 --> 31:08.860
Kyle! They're coming. Go!

31:08.870 --> 31:10.900
There they are!

31:23.370 --> 31:25.350
Take her.

31:29.000 --> 31:31.550
Put her down!

31:34.540 --> 31:37.630
- Put the girl down.
- Go!

32:01.160 --> 32:03.510
Put him in the chair.

32:21.200 --> 32:23.340
It was a rubber bullet.

32:23.360 --> 32:25.910
Waited a long time to meet you, Kyle.

32:26.340 --> 32:28.750
I'm glad you're here.

32:31.240 --> 32:32.730
What is this?

32:32.750 --> 32:34.330
You've been through a lot tonight.

32:34.340 --> 32:37.840
But you were amazing, man.

32:37.850 --> 32:40.630
You handled everything we threw at you.

32:41.110 --> 32:41.840
What do you mean?

32:41.860 --> 32:46.220
The way you used and controlled your abilities,
even though you were upset about Amanda.

32:46.240 --> 32:47.670
She'll be fine, by the way.

32:47.690 --> 32:49.560
You planned all of this?

32:49.580 --> 32:51.680
You've got a big future here, Kyle.

32:51.690 --> 32:53.420
We have a lot we need to talk about.

32:53.440 --> 32:56.000
I don't want anything to do with you.

32:56.380 --> 32:59.870
Look... you're angry. Fair enough.

32:59.880 --> 33:04.180
Our methods can seem
a little... extreme.

33:04.190 --> 33:08.750
You took me. You've frightened
my family! You took Amanda!

33:08.760 --> 33:09.820
She won't remember a thing.

33:09.850 --> 33:12.320
Don't ever go near her again.

33:12.340 --> 33:14.880
We're not the enemy, Kyle.

33:14.890 --> 33:18.820
We just want to know you.

33:20.140 --> 33:22.230
Work with you.

33:22.250 --> 33:26.370
No. I'll never be part of this.

33:29.330 --> 33:31.980
It's too much to take in for one night.

33:31.990 --> 33:35.540
Here... give him her bag.

33:36.980 --> 33:39.670
Don't forget your bowtie.

33:40.280 --> 33:44.440
They'll charge you an arm and
a leg if you forget it. Go home.

33:45.380 --> 33:47.980
They're all waiting.

33:51.540 --> 33:54.150
See you around.

34:01.780 --> 34:04.650
I don't want to wake them.

34:07.280 --> 34:09.670
Here's my key.

34:09.679 --> 34:11.429
At least you didn't lose it.

34:11.440 --> 34:13.610
That again?

34:13.620 --> 34:17.540
I meant your key. You
found your key. I swear.

34:21.020 --> 34:23.230
What?

34:23.489 --> 34:27.260
Nothing. I just...

34:27.989 --> 34:30.429
I don't know.

34:30.449 --> 34:33.360
Something about the way...

34:37.600 --> 34:40.370
this was the best night

34:41.179 --> 34:43.320
It was, wasn't it?

34:43.330 --> 34:46.050
And, now it's over.

34:46.900 --> 34:49.290
Yeah.

34:50.679 --> 34:53.710
So, I guess, good night?

34:55.090 --> 34:57.450
Right.

35:01.110 --> 35:03.570
Well, don't make me ask you for one.

35:04.000 --> 35:06.360
- One what?
- A hug.

35:06.820 --> 35:09.960
A hug? Absolutely.

35:51.880 --> 35:53.590
Kyle.

35:53.600 --> 35:54.950
Jessi, what are you doing here?

35:54.980 --> 35:56.440
I couldn't leave without you.

35:56.460 --> 36:00.160
- Amanda...
- No, she's here. She's fine.

36:00.170 --> 36:02.700
I think she might be starting
to wake up a little bit.

36:02.710 --> 36:03.640
What time is it?

36:03.650 --> 36:05.260
It's about 2:30.

36:05.300 --> 36:09.580
- I have to get her home.
- Wait, what happened? What did they want?

36:11.200 --> 36:13.920
He'll do anything for the girl.

36:17.750 --> 36:20.760
She'll do anything for him.

36:21.810 --> 36:24.420
Thanks for all your help.

36:27.860 --> 36:30.680
Did everything work
out the way you wanted?

36:31.010 --> 36:33.760
Exactly.

36:34.130 --> 36:37.010
They went to all that
trouble to meet you... ...

36:37.510 --> 36:40.720
and I was right there, but
they didn't care about me.

36:44.110 --> 36:47.020
Jessi, that's a good thing.

36:47.670 --> 36:50.320
You need to go that way
to get home to Sarah.

36:50.330 --> 36:51.980
I know.

36:51.990 --> 36:54.230
Will you be all right?

36:54.250 --> 36:56.700
Aren't I always?

36:57.370 --> 37:00.010
Thank you.

37:01.610 --> 37:04.890
You'll be late.

37:14.210 --> 37:15.860
Carol, please stay...

37:15.880 --> 37:19.050
it's 2:58, I need to see if she's back.

37:19.060 --> 37:20.980
All right. I'll walk you home.

37:22.790 --> 37:25.650
You need to stay here with your wife.

37:41.340 --> 37:43.430
you're awake.

37:46.680 --> 37:49.680
I must've fallen asleep
at the after-party.

37:51.720 --> 37:54.530
I'm sorry. Tonight must have
been so boring for you.

37:55.640 --> 37:58.970
I'm just glad to be standing
here with you right now.

37:58.980 --> 38:02.860
The whole night felt
like a dream. Did I...

38:05.370 --> 38:06.930
Amanda, you're home.

38:06.950 --> 38:08.830
You had me very worried.

38:08.840 --> 38:10.340
No need to worry, mrs. Bloom.

38:10.350 --> 38:11.510
Home by 3:00, as promised.

38:11.540 --> 38:15.840
And I'm supposed to be impressed that
you followed my simple instructions?

38:18.440 --> 38:20.890
Was it everything you imagined?

38:22.460 --> 38:24.600
Better.

39:01.370 --> 39:02.670
Sorry. Did I scare you?

39:02.680 --> 39:05.300
No, I...

39:06.540 --> 39:09.470
You're still here? Obviously.

39:09.480 --> 39:11.410
You're standing right in front of me.

39:11.420 --> 39:13.710
- Yes, well...
- Thanks for the tip.

39:13.720 --> 39:15.600
Sure.

39:16.200 --> 39:18.470
I never caught your name.

39:20.330 --> 39:22.110
Jessi.

39:22.120 --> 39:24.760
I'm Cassidy.

39:26.170 --> 39:28.730
Have a good night.

39:43.960 --> 39:45.900
Sarah?

39:49.830 --> 39:52.010
Sarah, I'm home.

39:54.050 --> 39:55.810
Sarah?

40:28.280 --> 40:30.450
Did I woke you?

40:30.740 --> 40:33.370
No, I'm still awake.

40:33.390 --> 40:35.380
Not for long.

40:35.400 --> 40:37.810
That spiked punch must have
really done a number on me.

40:37.830 --> 40:40.490
Amanda didn't remember
what had happened at all.

40:40.500 --> 40:43.220
You'll feel better in the morning.

40:44.090 --> 40:46.880
I want to thank you, Kyle.

40:46.890 --> 40:49.130
My night was perfect.

40:49.150 --> 40:51.570
Sweet dreams.

41:00.010 --> 41:02.770
The most important
thing was we were home.

41:02.790 --> 41:05.250
And she was safe.

41:06.120 --> 41:09.670
And for her, only
happy memories remained.
