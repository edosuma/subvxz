00:01.034 --> 00:02.634
- [Monique] Are those feathers?
- [gasps]

00:04.270 --> 00:06.005
- Hell!
- [exclaims]

00:06.039 --> 00:07.706
- Do you love it?
- I love it.

00:07.741 --> 00:12.277
This dress is everything
on you. [laughs]

00:12.311 --> 00:14.346
If my fiancé doesn't cry,
I'm gonna turn around.

00:14.381 --> 00:17.716
- Do I look like a queen?
- Twenty-four seven.

00:17.751 --> 00:19.418
But it's not the dress.

00:20.720 --> 00:21.720
It's a lot.

00:22.655 --> 00:25.290
- [meows]
- Do we have the skirt?

00:25.325 --> 00:27.092
[Lule] She has the overskirt.

00:27.127 --> 00:30.095
The overskirt, it wasn't
actually at the store yet.

00:30.130 --> 00:32.541
- [Joanne] The wedding's what, eleven days away?
- Eleven days away.

00:32.565 --> 00:33.799
We're in trouble.

00:35.101 --> 00:36.335
I'm very picky.

00:36.369 --> 00:38.771
I don't believe in a picky
bride. You like what you like.

00:38.805 --> 00:41.673
- Wow!
- Wow, Jessica, that's gorgeous.

00:41.708 --> 00:43.409
- No.
- You don't like anything?

00:43.443 --> 00:44.443
Mm-mm.

00:45.545 --> 00:48.347
- Oh, she's tough, this one is.
- Do you like it?

00:48.381 --> 00:49.248
- No.
- No?

00:49.282 --> 00:51.050
- Do you like it or no?
- I don't.

00:51.084 --> 00:52.084
I'm a little stumped.

00:52.118 --> 00:53.385
Do you feel like it's too much?

00:53.420 --> 00:56.789
I feel like everything is too
much. What I want is too much.

<i>Normal temperature.</i>

01:21.314 --> 01:22.714
Nothing about me is normal.

01:24.517 --> 01:26.351
When I'm walking down the aisle,

01:26.386 --> 01:28.020
I wanna look like I'm floating.

01:28.054 --> 01:29.855
- [whispering] Wow.
- [Monique] Oh.

01:31.291 --> 01:33.992
I want everyone to be like,
"Who is this angel

01:34.027 --> 01:37.496
that God has sent down
on this day to grace us?"

01:37.530 --> 01:39.932
Tell me this doesn't
scream "Queen".

01:39.966 --> 01:42.000
- Can I, like, double them up or no?
- [A.J.] No.

01:43.703 --> 01:46.872
Queen Queyonce, that's what everyone
calls me. "Queyonce the Fiancée."

01:47.607 --> 01:48.774
[chuckles]

01:48.808 --> 01:51.243
- [Monique] Are those feathers?
- You see feath... [gasps]

01:51.277 --> 01:55.080
No, it's like a ruffle-ruffle
Queyonce the Fiancée.

01:55.115 --> 01:57.449
If my fiancé doesn't cry,
I'm gonna turn around.

01:57.484 --> 01:59.318
<i>I promise the wedding
will be called off.</i>

01:59.352 --> 02:01.030
I'll have to turn around
and we'll have to start over.

02:01.054 --> 02:03.335
And if he can't get it right
the second time, it's a wrap.

02:05.525 --> 02:07.793
A.J.? We lost him.

02:08.695 --> 02:09.695
[A.J.] Sheesh!

02:10.797 --> 02:12.197
[Laquesha] Are you in here?

02:12.232 --> 02:13.699
- Oh, my gosh!
- [Laquesha laughing]

02:13.733 --> 02:17.269
- Oh, my God, there's so many gowns!
- [A.J.] Oh, my God.

02:20.406 --> 02:21.406
Hi!

02:21.908 --> 02:23.375
- How are you?
- Hi!

02:23.377 --> 02:25.911
I'm Krissy, are you Laquesha?

02:25.945 --> 02:27.713
- I'm not. [laughs]
- Oh, my God.

02:27.747 --> 02:29.181
Ohh.

02:29.215 --> 02:32.017
- I don't know where they went.
- We lost her.

02:32.051 --> 02:34.186
- The drama!
- Oh, whoa, whoa!

02:34.220 --> 02:37.556
- The drama!
- Okay. I see it. I see.

02:37.590 --> 02:42.094
- Laquesha?
- [Laquesha] That is so Queyonce the Fiancée.

02:42.128 --> 02:46.732
All of this beading, the
glamor, the detail, oh, I die!

02:46.766 --> 02:49.468
- [gasps] Hi!
- [Krissy] Hi! Oh, my gosh.

02:49.502 --> 02:53.005
You're so... You're in the stockroom,
you're like, "No, I'm digging it."

02:53.039 --> 02:56.408
- We're literally pulling gowns now.
- Oh, my God, hi! I'm Krissy.

02:56.442 --> 02:58.687
- It's so nice to meet... Oh, my God, I love the crown.
- Hi, Krissy!

02:58.711 --> 03:00.078
- Do you love it?
- Yes.

03:00.113 --> 03:03.715
- Yes, a queen is here.
- I'm Queen Queyonce. I am here, I've arrived.

03:03.750 --> 03:07.753
I found my bride in
our stockroom. This is crazy.

03:07.787 --> 03:10.489
We're not supposed to be in
the stockroom, so come with me.

03:10.523 --> 03:11.890
- Let's go.
- I won't tell anyone.

03:11.925 --> 03:14.660
We'll just sneak out.
That's between us.

03:14.694 --> 03:17.596
So today I brought with me
my best friend, A.J.

03:17.630 --> 03:19.498
We've known each other
for about 12 years.

03:19.532 --> 03:21.233
We lost Monique.

03:21.267 --> 03:26.104
And my best friend, Monique, and I, oh, gosh,
we've known each other for over 14 years.

03:26.139 --> 03:30.442
- Oh, I see her. There you are.
- Peekaboo.

03:30.476 --> 03:33.078
Without them, I wouldn't be
able to make this choice today.

03:33.112 --> 03:35.247
They will give me
their honest opinion.

03:35.281 --> 03:36.982
We got the crown.

03:37.016 --> 03:39.161
So that's what you're gonna
go for for the dress, you think?

03:39.185 --> 03:42.254
- Like something... - Oh, yeah,
I'm totally looking for royal, elegant,

03:42.288 --> 03:44.723
- glam for sure.
- Okay.

03:44.757 --> 03:47.125
[Laquesha] I'm looking
for two gowns today.

03:47.160 --> 03:50.062
The ceremony gown
and a reception gown.

03:50.096 --> 03:52.508
Because the queen has to come
in and make her entrance, right?

03:52.532 --> 03:54.099
[Krissy] Yes, okay, I love it.

03:54.133 --> 03:56.301
I definitely want
a big drama bottom,

03:56.336 --> 03:57.869
but totally fitted up top.

03:57.904 --> 04:00.072
And, tell me, price point,
where do you wanna stay?

04:00.106 --> 04:03.542
- Let's stay for both gowns at about $7,000.
- [Krissy] All right. Perfect.

04:05.044 --> 04:07.312
So I don't plan
to pay for my dress.

04:07.347 --> 04:09.681
Oh, my goodness!

04:09.716 --> 04:12.551
My mom was supposed to
join me today. She had to work.

04:12.585 --> 04:14.453
<i>But she's gonna pay
for one of my gowns,</i>

04:14.487 --> 04:17.289
and also, I'm the queen
of my house, so my fiancé,

04:17.323 --> 04:20.592
<i>of course, will pay
for the second dress.</i>

04:20.927 --> 04:22.027
All right.

04:22.061 --> 04:25.330
I don't know if she's actually
said that to Desmond yet.

04:25.365 --> 04:27.132
<i>♪ Here comes the bride ♪</i>

04:28.701 --> 04:31.803
- [chuckles] Yeah, he does...
- Yeah, no.

04:31.838 --> 04:33.505
- So welcome, welcome.
- How pretty.

04:33.539 --> 04:35.507
We're gonna be spending
a lot of time in here.

04:35.541 --> 04:38.310
When a bride is shopping
for two dresses at once,

04:38.344 --> 04:40.345
it's nice to kind of
have a plan,

04:40.380 --> 04:43.548
<i>like, where we're going first.
But this first round of dresses</i>

04:43.583 --> 04:45.550
<i>were kind of like
miscellaneous pulls.</i>

04:45.585 --> 04:46.852
One is from A.J.

04:47.987 --> 04:49.988
- What is happening?
- This.

04:51.157 --> 04:52.724
One is from Monique.

04:52.759 --> 04:55.527
- This is Pantora Bridal.
- I love Pant...

04:55.561 --> 04:57.663
- [gasps] Oh, my God.
- [Krissy] Yes.

04:57.697 --> 05:01.600
We're gonna start with those just to
kind of feel out what she's going with.

05:01.634 --> 05:04.169
I literally, like,
I came knowing that

05:04.203 --> 05:06.548
Pantora was gonna be one of
the gowns that I left with today.

05:06.572 --> 05:08.674
- Oh. She's, like, young, fresh, like...
- Yeah!

05:08.708 --> 05:10.185
[Krissy] I love everything
about their collecsh.

05:10.209 --> 05:12.254
[Laquesha] Oh, my God,
I'm so excited to get in that.

05:12.278 --> 05:14.713
So I came to try on
Pantora gowns,

05:14.747 --> 05:18.083
and the very first gown
is so beautiful.

05:18.117 --> 05:24.056
It has so much detail. It looks
like it would definitely fit me to a tee.

05:24.090 --> 05:25.791
That is beautiful.

05:25.825 --> 05:29.361
Pantora never disappoints.
This is so beautiful.

05:29.395 --> 05:32.130
[Krissy] The shape
is everything on you.

05:32.165 --> 05:33.932
[Laquesha] My only fear
is the cleavage.

05:33.966 --> 05:36.935
But this dress literally says...

05:36.969 --> 05:38.837
Queyonce the Fiancée.

05:38.871 --> 05:40.672
Did Desmond come up with that?

05:40.707 --> 05:43.408
I don't know who, I
think it was... I don't know!

05:43.443 --> 05:46.912
At the proposal, like,
everyone started saying that.

05:49.549 --> 05:51.550
Aww, makes me so giddy.

05:51.584 --> 05:54.353
My fiancé's name
is Desmond Boyken.

05:54.387 --> 05:56.221
<i>Um, we met in high school,</i>

05:56.255 --> 05:59.458
<i>and reconnected, um, in
our adult life two years ago.</i>

05:59.492 --> 06:02.594
So, yeah, he put a ring
on it after just a year.

06:02.628 --> 06:05.330
<i>He's just so welcoming,
so open, so loving,</i>

06:05.365 --> 06:08.433
<i>and I, literally, I die
and I fall in love with it</i>

06:08.468 --> 06:09.768
every single day.

06:09.802 --> 06:13.205
He finds new ways every day
to love me, and it's just amazing.

06:14.107 --> 06:15.974
<i>♪ They are gonna die ♪</i>

06:16.008 --> 06:17.642
And if they don't...

06:17.677 --> 06:19.121
- [Krissy] Yeah.
- They're gonna be stranded here.

06:19.145 --> 06:20.622
[Krissy] If they don't,
we're turning around

06:20.646 --> 06:21.613
and we're gonna come back out...

06:21.647 --> 06:23.158
[Laquesha] Exactly. Until
they get it right.

06:23.182 --> 06:25.851
- But first, hang tight, one sec.
- Okay.

06:27.019 --> 06:28.053
Wait.

06:29.989 --> 06:32.758
- Hello.
- Hello, beautiful, how are you?

06:32.792 --> 06:35.660
<i>I'm doing good!
My bride is amazing,</i>

06:35.695 --> 06:37.095
<i>Laquesha, you're gonna love her.</i>

06:37.130 --> 06:38.296
Okay.

06:38.331 --> 06:41.400
I'd like you to meet
somebody very special.

06:42.502 --> 06:44.102
Randy! [chuckles]

06:44.137 --> 06:45.937
<i>Hello, beautiful!</i>

06:45.972 --> 06:47.606
- How are you?
<i>- Hi, Randy!</i>

06:47.640 --> 06:50.909
<i>I'm great, how are you?
Oh, my gosh!</i>

06:50.943 --> 06:52.978
Um, you need
a lot of help, right?

06:53.012 --> 06:55.080
I have so many
grand entrances to make.

06:55.114 --> 06:58.116
I cannot do that with the
same dress over and over.

06:58.151 --> 07:00.452
- All right, we're gonna head out, Randy.
- Okay.

07:03.222 --> 07:06.224
- [gasps] Oh!
- Oh, snap.

07:06.259 --> 07:07.893
[all chuckle]

07:08.728 --> 07:09.761
I like that.

07:09.796 --> 07:12.297
- Do you love it?
- [Monique] It looks amazing.

07:14.200 --> 07:17.202
- Do I look like a queen?
- Twenty-four seven.

07:18.004 --> 07:21.206
Yeah, this dress is blinged out.

07:23.676 --> 07:25.053
[Randy]<i> So let me meet</i>
<i>your entourage!</i>

07:25.077 --> 07:27.646
- [Laquesha] These are my best friends.
- Hi!

07:27.680 --> 07:30.215
- [Laquesha] This is Monique.
- Hi, Randy.

07:30.249 --> 07:31.883
- [Laquesha] And this is A.J.
- Hello.

07:31.918 --> 07:35.854
- Nice to meet you.
- So, what do you two think of this gown?

07:35.888 --> 07:37.933
[Monique] Yeah, I love the
way it, like, hugs her body.

07:37.957 --> 07:39.601
- [Laquesha] The silhouette?
- [Monique] Yeah.

07:39.625 --> 07:42.327
And then it's got, like,
that glam at the bottom.

07:42.361 --> 07:45.030
- [Laquesha] I actually love the detail here.
- [Monique] Yeah.

07:45.064 --> 07:48.433
I think you look beautiful
in it. But it's not the dress.

07:57.109 --> 07:58.821
I think the buttons
need to start at the top.

07:58.845 --> 08:00.579
- I agree.
- Yeah, let's do full buttons.

08:01.848 --> 08:04.049
- See, I love this.
- [chuckles]

08:04.083 --> 08:07.152
- You don't like this?
- Thank you, next.

08:07.186 --> 08:10.088
- Why? I really like this.
- No.

08:10.122 --> 08:12.824
My mom bought her dress
here, like, 35 years ago,

08:12.859 --> 08:17.329
so I think for her, it would be so cool
for her to buy her daughter's dress here.

08:17.363 --> 08:21.466
But I've shopped twice before
and I hate everything.

08:23.569 --> 08:24.970
Good luck to me.

08:25.004 --> 08:27.939
Imagine you walking in
with a dress bigger than you.

08:28.641 --> 08:30.342
[Jessica]<i> I grew up dancing.</i>

08:31.644 --> 08:34.779
<i>And I own a dance studio
on Long Island.</i>

08:34.814 --> 08:37.082
<i>So dealing with so many
dramatic costumes,</i>

08:37.116 --> 08:39.718
<i>and rhinestones and feathers,
I've kind been jaded</i>

08:39.752 --> 08:43.188
that I just feel like nothing
exceeds my expectations anymore.

08:43.923 --> 08:45.323
I'm kinda stressed.

08:45.358 --> 08:46.725
I'm looking for Jessica?

08:46.759 --> 08:48.437
- Hi. That's me. Nice to meet you.
- [Amber] Hi, how are you?

08:48.461 --> 08:49.838
- So beautiful.
- [Jessica] Thank you.

08:49.862 --> 08:51.963
I can't take it. It's gonna
be fun to dress you.

08:51.998 --> 08:53.131
And you guys are?

08:53.165 --> 08:55.066
- I'm Marybeth, her mom.
- Nice to meet you.

08:55.101 --> 08:57.536
- I'm Jamie, I'm her sister.
- I'm Amber, nice to meet you.

08:57.570 --> 08:58.970
So is this
your first time shopping?

08:59.005 --> 09:00.883
- No, this is not my first time shopping.
- [Amber] Okay.

09:00.907 --> 09:02.551
Okay, so what happened the
first time you went shopping?

09:02.575 --> 09:05.377
Did you guys learn anything?
Has there been a lot of dresses, or...

09:05.411 --> 09:07.812
- I learnt that I'm very picky.
- Okay.

09:07.847 --> 09:10.949
I will tell you I don't believe in a
picky bride. You like what you like,

09:10.983 --> 09:12.828
- you don't like what you don't like.
- [Jessica] Yeah. Right.

09:12.852 --> 09:14.363
- Hopefully, I find something you like, right?
- Okay.

09:14.387 --> 09:17.989
- Yeah. Definitely.
- Why do you think you're picky, like, what happened?

09:18.024 --> 09:20.025
Because there's so many things
I want in a dress,

09:20.059 --> 09:23.161
- and I just don't think I can find that in one dress.
- Okay. Okay.

09:24.597 --> 09:27.032
So I am looking for
something tight,

09:27.066 --> 09:31.803
with a very long train, either, like, a
plunged front or an open back, maybe both.

09:31.837 --> 09:34.940
Nothing strapless.
Skinny straps.

09:34.974 --> 09:39.344
Maybe a little lace, a little glam, and
I'm getting married over the summer,

09:39.378 --> 09:41.680
so thin fabric, that's
super important to me.

09:41.714 --> 09:44.716
[Amber] So it feels like a
long list, but, like, I have ideas.

09:44.750 --> 09:47.018
- Okay.
- [Amber] Like, instantly, I'm like, "Okay."

09:47.053 --> 09:49.020
What's the price point
that we wanna stay around?

09:49.055 --> 09:50.789
- Between $3,000 and $4,000.
- [Amber] Okay.

09:50.823 --> 09:52.223
What do you guys see her in?

09:53.225 --> 09:56.194
Bigger than Cinderella...

09:56.228 --> 09:58.697
Like, pull her up
on a horse and carriage

09:58.731 --> 10:01.299
and stop the show,
take everyone's breath away,

10:01.334 --> 10:02.667
diamonds, sparkle, all that.

10:04.136 --> 10:06.037
- [Amber] How tall are you?
- I'm four eleven.

10:06.072 --> 10:07.472
Do you want a ballgown?

10:07.506 --> 10:08.717
- No.
- [Amber] I didn't think so.

10:08.741 --> 10:11.176
I felt it, like, coming off
of your body.

10:11.210 --> 10:16.648
If I put that ballgown on, I'm
gonna look like a child going to prom.

10:16.682 --> 10:19.150
- Okay, so maybe we'll try on one...
- [Jessica] Okay.

10:19.185 --> 10:20.485
Or five.

10:20.519 --> 10:24.656
Or five? No, we have to try on
the ones that you wanna try on!

10:24.690 --> 10:27.302
We will, yes, but I wanna see
something that she wouldn't normally...

10:27.326 --> 10:29.037
- [Jessica] There was one.
- [Amber] Did you see one?

10:29.061 --> 10:31.573
There was one that I was like,
"All right, I'm willing to try it on."

10:31.597 --> 10:33.832
- [Amber] Okay.
- Do you remember which one it was?

10:33.866 --> 10:35.644
- The one in the window?
- [Jessica] I think it was over here.

10:35.668 --> 10:37.045
The one in the window
is magnificent.

10:37.069 --> 10:38.603
What was in the window?

10:38.638 --> 10:40.849
- The one that... Oh, it's beautiful.
- [Amber] Do you want that?

10:40.873 --> 10:43.051
- All right. It's heavier than me.
- Oh, here, let me help you.

10:43.075 --> 10:45.153
- No problem. It's taller than you.
- That dress is exquisite.

10:45.177 --> 10:47.055
- For sure. Okay, this is beautiful.
- [Jamie] Oh, my God.

10:47.079 --> 10:48.947
She's like, "If I'm gonna
do a ballgown..."

10:48.981 --> 10:51.883
- Yeah, this is a huge "if".
- Okay.

10:51.917 --> 10:53.251
Don't get it twisted.

10:53.285 --> 10:57.022
I feel like a lot of people are
expecting, like, a huge ballgown,

10:57.056 --> 10:59.858
a sick dress, and it's
honestly at this point,

10:59.892 --> 11:02.427
<i>I'm like, the wedding
shouldn't be about my dress,</i>

11:02.461 --> 11:03.772
or how much I care
about my dress,

11:03.796 --> 11:05.897
or how other people
look at me in my dress.

11:05.931 --> 11:08.767
I just wanna enjoy the night
with my husband.

11:10.369 --> 11:14.673
<i>My fiancé, Joey, he is a
fireman, and he works in Queens.</i>

11:14.707 --> 11:16.941
Joey always jokes about
the first time we met,

11:16.976 --> 11:20.111
because I was a huge... bitch.

11:21.313 --> 11:22.781
<i>It was the VMAs,</i>

11:22.815 --> 11:24.883
<i>Beyoncé was performing,
she was opening it up,</i>

11:24.917 --> 11:27.285
<i>and she had just gotten
on stage,</i>

11:27.319 --> 11:30.922
and he walked in to just go and, you
know, come up to me and say hello.

11:30.956 --> 11:33.625
And I put my hand in front of
his face, and I said, "Hold on.

11:33.659 --> 11:35.527
Beyoncé's on stage."

11:35.561 --> 11:38.540
<i>You know, I apologized and I was like,
"I needed to watch Beyoncé right now.</i>

11:38.564 --> 11:42.000
You don't know who I am just yet,
but I promise, I'm not like this usually."

11:42.034 --> 11:44.035
<i>It's been cloud nine ever since,</i>

11:44.070 --> 11:45.870
and I'm just so excited
to marry him.

11:45.905 --> 11:49.174
Okay, so this one
we definitely will try on,

11:49.208 --> 11:50.975
but I wanna get you
changed, okay?

11:51.010 --> 11:54.389
And I'm gonna go grab my first thoughts, like,
first thoughts are usually right thoughts,

11:54.413 --> 11:55.757
- don't be afraid to be honest with me.
- Okay.

11:55.781 --> 11:58.126
- Okay, and then we'll go from there.
- I'm gonna be very honest.

11:58.150 --> 12:00.185
You can be honest, that's
okay. I didn't design it.

12:00.219 --> 12:01.530
- So I'll be right back, okay?
- Okay.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.794
- Okay. Thank you. Okay.
- All right, cool. You're welcome.

12:04.490 --> 12:06.691
I'm very overwhelmed.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.960
I don't know how this
is gonna go.

12:08.994 --> 12:11.262
I'm already going into a dress
that I don't even like.

12:11.297 --> 12:13.298
So I think that just says a lot.

12:15.434 --> 12:17.135
It's a lot.

12:17.169 --> 12:20.438
- We want a lot.
- [Monique] We want a lot, but I don't like that dress.

12:22.108 --> 12:24.843
[Jessica] Everything to me
is, like...

12:24.877 --> 12:27.445
- Blah.
- It's probably easier to displease Jessica

12:27.480 --> 12:29.191
<i>- than to please her.</i>
<i>- [Amber]</i> Let's put this on.

12:29.215 --> 12:31.783
This is not happening.
I'm not putting this dress on.

12:38.457 --> 12:41.559
[Amber] I've got flowers, and
sparkle and it's super fitted,

12:41.594 --> 12:45.296
and it's got the sexy plunge.
Hopefully, it hits all her checkmarks.

12:45.931 --> 12:46.931
Okay?

12:49.468 --> 12:50.702
- Okay, Jessica?
- Yes.

12:50.736 --> 12:52.971
- All right, I have some good options for you.
- Okay.

12:53.005 --> 12:56.151
Is there anything that you're, like, excited
about, or is it like, "Uh, I don't know?"

12:56.175 --> 12:59.210
[Jessica] Everything to me
is, like...

12:59.245 --> 13:01.379
- Blah. This one's nice.
- Blah? Okay.

13:01.413 --> 13:04.816
It's probably easier to displease
Jessica than to please her.

13:04.850 --> 13:08.353
Mom. Imagine your
four-foot-eleven daughter in this.

13:08.387 --> 13:10.288
- In...
- I... I can, actually.

13:10.322 --> 13:12.056
- Oh, my goodness!
- It's stunning.

13:12.091 --> 13:15.137
[Jamie]<i> She's stubborn, but we're hoping
maybe we could push her into something</i>

13:15.161 --> 13:17.028
that we imagined her.

13:17.062 --> 13:20.799
As her little sister, I always imagined
her being, like, the ballerina, Cinderella,

13:20.833 --> 13:22.811
- all that, so, that's what I'm gonna push for.
- Mm-hmm.

13:22.835 --> 13:24.936
- Me, too. We love that look.
- Yeah.

13:24.970 --> 13:27.839
The bigger the sparkle,
the better for me.

13:27.873 --> 13:30.341
Yeah, but this is exactly
what she doesn't want

13:30.376 --> 13:32.677
- and the big beads.
- Beautiful, Just beautiful.

13:32.711 --> 13:35.814
- [Jamie] I know, but it's her wedding.
- Oh, boy.

13:35.848 --> 13:37.982
[Jamie] It's not our wedding.

13:38.017 --> 13:41.986
Yeah, that ballgown that they ended
up, you know, wanting me to try on,

13:42.021 --> 13:44.789
I took it to the dressing room,
but I said, "This is not happening.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.291
I am not putting
this dress on."

13:46.325 --> 13:49.171
- I just feel like I'm gonna go to my 13th birthday party.
- [Amber] Yeah.

13:49.195 --> 13:51.796
- [Jessica] With a tiara.
- [Amber] No tiaras.

13:51.831 --> 13:54.911
I'm think I'm gonna have a huge challenge
keeping them on the same page as me.

13:55.868 --> 13:57.145
[Amber] So let's start
with this one.

13:57.169 --> 13:59.637
This one's brand new,
this one's by Yumi Katsura.

13:59.672 --> 14:01.840
- [Jessica] Okay.
- [Amber] So the only thing is,

14:01.874 --> 14:03.084
it has a little bit
of a thicker strap.

14:03.108 --> 14:04.909
Is the strap too thick
for you, do you think?

14:04.943 --> 14:06.621
- [Jessica] No, but I'll try it.
- [Amber] No? Okay, good.

14:06.645 --> 14:09.057
- The only thing I don't like about this dress is the belt.
- [Amber] Yeah.

14:09.081 --> 14:10.926
- Okay, belt can be removed.
- [Jessica] But... Right.

14:10.950 --> 14:12.894
- [Amber] That's, like, easy fix.
- [Jessica] Okay.

14:12.918 --> 14:16.387
I think this appointment is
gonna be a little bit challenging

14:16.422 --> 14:18.957
only because Jessica's going
into this appointment

14:18.991 --> 14:21.292
with a mindset of being picky.

14:21.327 --> 14:23.628
<i>If you are defeated
in the beginning,</i>

14:23.662 --> 14:26.197
then it makes it much harder
for you to like a dress

14:26.232 --> 14:28.266
throughout
the entire appointment.

14:28.300 --> 14:30.435
[grunts] It's, like, silvery.
I'm a very gold person.

14:30.469 --> 14:32.214
- This reminds me of, like, a winter dress.
- [Amber] Got it.

14:32.238 --> 14:33.678
Okay, got it.
Okay, let's keep going.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.840
- So thin strap.
- [Jessica] Okay. Mm-hmm.

14:35.875 --> 14:37.708
- [Amber] 3D flowers.
- [Jessica] Mm-hmm.

14:37.710 --> 14:40.578
- [Amber] Low front, low back, fit and flare.
- [Jessica] Okay.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.424
- [Amber] And then it's got this long train.
- [Jessica] I'll try.

14:42.448 --> 14:44.392
- [Amber] And it's all lined in soft gold.
- [Jessica] Yeah.

14:44.416 --> 14:46.194
- [Amber] What do you think?
- [Jessica] Yeah, I'll try it.

14:46.218 --> 14:49.554
Really, it checks all
those boxes from her list.

14:49.588 --> 14:51.623
So let's see how
Jessica feel sin this one.

14:51.657 --> 14:54.292
- Look how long you look.
- [Jessica] Yeah.

14:55.995 --> 14:57.629
- How do you feel?
- It's all right.

14:57.663 --> 14:58.940
- You're allowed to like it.
- It's happening.

14:58.964 --> 15:01.432
- [Amber] Look. [chuckles] -
[Jessica] Things are happening.

15:01.467 --> 15:03.468
[Amber] She's like,
"What's going on?"

15:03.502 --> 15:05.169
We actually, like,
kinda like this.

15:05.204 --> 15:06.671
Yes. Yeah, I kinda like it.

15:06.705 --> 15:11.009
Kinda. I like the buttons. The
buttons are pretty. Let's show them.

15:11.043 --> 15:13.611
<i>I am loving what I see.</i>

15:13.646 --> 15:15.323
But I still feel like
there is something missing,

15:15.347 --> 15:18.683
that there is this wow factor
that I could have.

15:18.717 --> 15:20.184
Oh, my gosh.

15:20.219 --> 15:23.855
Maybe they can tell me something
that I'm missing that I just don't see.

15:23.889 --> 15:26.457
- [Jamie] Wow.
- [Marybeth] Oh, Jessica, that's gorgeous.

15:26.492 --> 15:28.393
- Look at the train.
- Magnificent.

15:30.029 --> 15:33.231
- Love it. Love it. Love it.
- Oh, my gosh.

15:34.934 --> 15:36.578
[Jamie] And it's that
mermaid fit that I love.

15:36.602 --> 15:38.770
- [Amber] It is.
- [Jessica] Yeah, you love.

15:38.804 --> 15:41.806
- But do you want the mermaid fit, too, right?
- I do, kind of.

15:41.840 --> 15:44.242
- I like the, you know...
- [Marybeth] Long train?

15:44.276 --> 15:45.787
- [Jessica] Yeah.
- [Marybeth] Is it heavy?

15:45.811 --> 15:47.312
It's a little heavy.

15:47.346 --> 15:49.314
That's one of the things
that I'm kinda iffy on,

15:49.348 --> 15:51.249
- is the weight of the dress.
- [Amber] Okay.

15:51.283 --> 15:53.251
- I like this dress. I don't love it.
- Okay.

15:53.285 --> 15:54.752
I love it.

15:54.787 --> 15:56.531
If you couldn't already tell,
it's our wedding, so...

15:56.555 --> 15:59.991
- [chuckles] - I'm in my first
dress, and I'm already exhausted.

16:00.025 --> 16:03.027
<i>They're gonna love me
in something no matter what.</i>

16:03.062 --> 16:05.697
<i>And I don't think they see
the bigger picture here,</i>

16:05.731 --> 16:09.634
<i>of something that I need to
love more than they need to love.</i>

16:09.668 --> 16:11.669
Thirty-seven years ago,
I went to Kleinfeld's

16:11.704 --> 16:15.473
and I put my dress on and I knew
immediately that was my gown.

16:15.507 --> 16:18.009
<i>I put that third dress on
and boom, that was it.</i>

16:18.043 --> 16:19.344
- That was it? Only three?
- Yep.

16:19.378 --> 16:20.855
- I love that you're...
- When you put your gown on

16:20.879 --> 16:23.081
and you know it's yours,
it's just, that's it.

16:23.115 --> 16:26.651
For her, it would be so cool for
her to buy her daughter's dress here.

16:26.685 --> 16:28.430
So hopefully, I have the
same moment that you did.

16:28.454 --> 16:29.698
[Jamie] This bringing
you back, Mom?

16:29.722 --> 16:31.499
- [Marybeth] It's just bringing me back.
- It is a big deal.

16:31.523 --> 16:32.824
And I do feel the pressure.

16:32.858 --> 16:35.259
When you put your dress on,
the rules go out of the window.

16:35.294 --> 16:37.005
- Right.
- [Amber] It's like a fiancé, you know,

16:37.029 --> 16:39.541
throw the checklist out the window when they
make you feel good, that's how you know.

16:39.565 --> 16:41.476
- All right.
- [Amber] Okay, all right, let's try another one.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.401
Let's try another one.

16:43.435 --> 16:45.835
- Oh, my God, that dress is gorgeous.
- [Jamie] Yeah, I know.

16:54.880 --> 16:58.016
So what do you two
think of this gown?

17:00.753 --> 17:02.820
[Monique] I think
you look beautiful in it.

17:02.855 --> 17:04.322
But it's not the dress.

17:05.958 --> 17:09.060
Today, I'm looking for a ceremony
gown and a reception gown.

17:09.094 --> 17:13.398
I totally want something
dramatic, over the top, va va voom.

17:13.432 --> 17:14.465
It's a lot.

17:16.301 --> 17:17.301
We want a lot.

17:18.804 --> 17:21.305
We want a lot, but I don't...
I don't like that dress.

17:21.340 --> 17:22.974
- For the day.
- [Laquesha] Okay.

17:23.008 --> 17:26.077
It molds to every curve
of my body.

17:26.111 --> 17:28.446
<i>T literally fits me amazing.</i>

17:28.480 --> 17:30.648
<i>Um, but it's super revealing.</i>

17:30.682 --> 17:32.283
<i>So I have my reservations.</i>

17:32.317 --> 17:36.421
And no one was actually able to say,
"I think this is way too much cleavage."

17:37.790 --> 17:40.324
- [Randy]<i> Okay, so...</i>
<i>- [Krissy]</i> Talk to me, Randy.

17:40.359 --> 17:43.461
<i>I think you have maybe
a low apex.</i>

17:43.495 --> 17:46.431
You know, this is
the apex right here.

17:46.465 --> 17:49.734
- [Laquesha]<i> Yes.</i>
- So, if you have a lower apex,

17:49.768 --> 17:52.370
what happens is,
you have a lot of space

17:52.404 --> 17:55.273
between your shoulder
and your apex.

17:55.307 --> 17:57.408
So it's gonna look like
a lot of skin,

17:57.443 --> 18:00.745
and it's gonna sometimes look
like the dress is falling off you.

18:00.779 --> 18:03.981
<i>So you might need something
with a strap.</i>

18:04.016 --> 18:08.719
Or something up here that's
gonna fill in all this bare area.

18:08.754 --> 18:11.022
<i>- Does that make sense?</i>
- It does. It totally does.

18:11.056 --> 18:13.724
I'm so open to that.
I'm totally open to that.

18:13.759 --> 18:17.128
<i>And I also think that's gonna
help support you a bit, as well.</i>

18:17.162 --> 18:19.730
Oh, yeah. I've been blessed.

18:19.765 --> 18:21.032
[chuckling] Yes, you have.

18:21.066 --> 18:23.201
- [Laquesha]<i> Heavily.</i>
- [all laughing]

18:23.235 --> 18:24.915
- [Monique] What do you think?
- I like it.

18:25.904 --> 18:27.972
I'm waiting for you
to see mine, though.

18:28.006 --> 18:31.175
- [Laquesha] Okay.
- [A.J.] So I just went with, like, First Lady vibes.

18:31.210 --> 18:32.543
That's a hell no.

18:32.578 --> 18:33.978
- Oh!
- [Krissy laughs]

18:34.012 --> 18:37.181
[A.J. laughs] That is
what you'll try on, though.

18:37.216 --> 18:39.060
- [Laquesha] Absolutely not.
- [A.J] No, we're gonna try it on.

18:39.084 --> 18:40.518
The sleeves?

18:40.552 --> 18:42.820
[Krissy] We'll get some
style inspo.

18:42.855 --> 18:45.223
[Laquesha] We can't take
anything from this.

18:45.257 --> 18:48.025
It looks a little
conservative to me.

18:48.060 --> 18:49.594
[A.J.] Some may say that,
some may not.

18:51.029 --> 18:52.964
[all laughing]

18:52.998 --> 18:54.532
No, it's like a granny dress.

18:56.235 --> 18:59.337
Let's get this off
and that back on the rack.

18:59.371 --> 19:01.239
Yeah, these we'll put back.

19:01.273 --> 19:03.841
- [A.J. meows] - [Laquesha]
All right, Randy, I'll be back.

19:03.909 --> 19:05.710
Okay, I'll be waiting.

19:05.744 --> 19:06.904
[Monique] Wonder what's next.

19:10.282 --> 19:15.253
I have one specific dress in mind
that I'm super, super excited for.

19:17.089 --> 19:19.323
And this is her.

19:20.125 --> 19:22.126
<i>She is beautiful.</i>

19:22.161 --> 19:25.730
We got the feather vibe here,
which is so glamorous,

19:25.764 --> 19:28.065
so I'm just gonna
bring this one in right now,

19:28.133 --> 19:29.600
'cause I'm that confident
about it.

19:31.036 --> 19:33.704
<i>If she put this dress on
and she didn't love it,</i>

19:33.739 --> 19:36.407
<i>I would actually be so,
so surprised.</i>

19:36.441 --> 19:38.743
I wonder what's going to
come through that door.

19:38.777 --> 19:40.111
So I'm kinda nervous.

19:40.145 --> 19:42.013
- [Krissy] Are you ready?
- [Laquesha] Yes.

19:42.047 --> 19:45.750
Okay, I came back with one dress
because I'm that excited about it.

19:45.784 --> 19:48.664
- [Laquesha] Okay. All right.
- I have this much faith in it. Look at this.

19:50.923 --> 19:52.323
[whispering] She's beautiful.

20:00.432 --> 20:03.734
Okay, so I think everybody liked
this dress more than you like the dress.

20:03.769 --> 20:05.036
Yeah, I think so, too.

20:05.070 --> 20:06.337
- Which is okay.
- Yeah.

20:06.371 --> 20:08.005
- We'll keep going, okay?
- Okay.

20:08.040 --> 20:10.541
I would have been like,
"Done, love it!" But...

20:10.576 --> 20:12.187
Then again, she puts on
anything, she looks good.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.556
I did the third dress, you
know, when I went to Kleinfeld's,

20:14.580 --> 20:16.858
<i>I went by myself and I tried
a couple of dresses on, and...</i>

20:16.882 --> 20:18.883
Wait, you only went
to one place.

20:18.917 --> 20:20.528
- One.
- To Kleinfeld's, put on three dresses,

20:20.552 --> 20:22.430
- and you said, "I'm getting married in this."
- That's correct.

20:22.454 --> 20:24.494
- And you bought it that day. Wow.
- That's correct.

20:25.224 --> 20:28.226
Next, we're gonna try on
the Tony Ward Alexa.

20:28.260 --> 20:32.063
This is a dress that Mom actually
saw in the front store window,

20:32.097 --> 20:34.809
<i>which also would have been
something that I would have pulled, too.</i>

20:34.833 --> 20:37.468
And most importantly,
it's lightweight.

20:40.739 --> 20:43.407
Yes, Oh, yeah.
Oh, yeah.

20:43.442 --> 20:46.077
It looks good? This is the one
from the mannequin, Mom,

20:46.111 --> 20:48.191
- that you wanted to see.
- [Marybeth] It's stunning.

20:52.484 --> 20:53.684
[Amber] This is the Tony Ward.

20:54.753 --> 20:56.187
- [Jamie] I love this.
- Stunning.

20:56.221 --> 20:57.688
My God, Jessica,
you look gorgeous.

20:57.723 --> 20:59.534
- [Jamie] I love this.
- [Marybeth] You look gorgeous.

20:59.558 --> 21:02.860
It's different than, like, any other
wedding dress I've ever seen.

21:02.894 --> 21:04.973
- Like, especially the color.
- [Marybeth] It's beautiful.

21:04.997 --> 21:07.531
Yeah, and it's also...
I love the back.

21:07.566 --> 21:09.410
- It's sexy and elegant.
- [Marybeth] I just love the straps.

21:09.434 --> 21:13.271
- It is sexy and elegant.
- [Jamie] Yeah.

21:13.305 --> 21:17.174
I feel like we're, like, fawning over you
right now, and you're just not impressed.

21:17.209 --> 21:19.610
Oh, she's tough.
This one is tough.

21:22.381 --> 21:25.916
This dress had the weight to
it. I felt like I could walk in it.

21:25.951 --> 21:31.088
<i>I could walk in it. I felt super light.
But I do feel I looked a little like...</i>

21:31.123 --> 21:33.858
Babyish. I looked a little
girlyish in these, like, petals.

21:33.892 --> 21:35.303
And the amount of skin
it shows, it's, like,

21:35.327 --> 21:37.128
that perfect amount of sexy
that you wanted.

21:37.162 --> 21:39.440
- [Marybeth] Exactly.
- [Jamie] But still classy enough to be in a church

21:39.464 --> 21:41.832
and you got me, girl.

21:41.867 --> 21:45.636
My family just loves everything that
I'm in and I don't love anything at all.

21:45.671 --> 21:47.204
We're just not on the same page.

21:48.607 --> 21:50.775
I think she'll like this one.
What do you think?

21:50.809 --> 21:52.954
- Look, I'm, like, second guessing myself now.
- I know.

21:52.978 --> 21:56.013
These poor women,
dealing with me.

21:56.048 --> 21:59.350
I don't know what I want.
I thought I did. I don't.

21:59.384 --> 22:03.721
- [Krissy] When you put her on, she will not fail.
- Yeah. Okay.

22:03.755 --> 22:06.490
- I told you I trust you, right, Krissy?
- Yeah.

22:06.525 --> 22:08.726
The dress look cheap.
[laughs]

22:17.569 --> 22:19.370
- [Krissy] Are you ready?
- [Laquesha] Yes.

22:19.404 --> 22:21.372
Okay, I came back
with one dress.

22:21.406 --> 22:23.441
- Because I'm that excited about it.
- Okay.

22:23.475 --> 22:25.653
- I have this much faith in it. Look at this.
- All right.

22:25.677 --> 22:27.812
- Can I open my eyes?
- Open

22:30.882 --> 22:32.183
[whispering] She's beautiful.

22:32.217 --> 22:34.185
The dress looks cheap.
[laughs]

22:35.654 --> 22:39.223
When you put her on, she's
gonna come to life, I promise you.

22:39.257 --> 22:41.492
- Okay. Okay.
- This is Pantora.

22:41.526 --> 22:43.527
This is your... your girl.

22:43.562 --> 22:47.164
What is rubbing me
the wrong way about the dress,

22:47.199 --> 22:50.434
<i>um, is the tulle around
the top, the feathers is, like,</i>

22:50.469 --> 22:52.603
almost there, but not so much.

22:52.637 --> 22:55.506
- I trust you.
- She will not fail.

22:55.540 --> 22:57.608
- Okay.
- Yay!

22:57.642 --> 23:00.544
She asked me to go
completely out of the ballpark,

23:00.579 --> 23:03.948
so I'm trusting in Krissy
for sure.

23:03.982 --> 23:06.283
- I told you I trusted you, right, Krissy?
- Yeah.

23:07.119 --> 23:09.220
Wow. Girl.

23:09.254 --> 23:11.388
- Wow.
- You look gorgeous in this.

23:11.390 --> 23:15.559
Oh, I die. I literally die.

23:15.594 --> 23:19.864
This could totally be
entry, like, reception gown.

23:19.898 --> 23:21.332
- Exactly.
- I can, yeah.

23:21.366 --> 23:25.236
This give me, like,
I am now an M-R-S.

23:25.270 --> 23:27.738
- Yeah.
- I am no longer Queyonce the Fiancée,

23:27.772 --> 23:29.874
but Queyonce the Wife.
[laughs]

23:29.908 --> 23:31.942
- This is, like...
- Yeah, this...

23:31.977 --> 23:34.712
Yeah, I didn't know how I was
gonna feel about this.

23:34.746 --> 23:37.081
- It's incredible.
- Yeah, it's beautiful.

23:41.219 --> 23:42.286
[gasps]

23:42.921 --> 23:45.689
- Yes!
- [A.J.] Whoa!

23:45.724 --> 23:47.591
- See, now we're talking.
- [Randy speaking]

23:47.626 --> 23:49.971
- Can you believe it?
- Is this the First Lady vibes that you were looking for?

23:49.995 --> 23:52.596
- Oh, my God!
- [A.J.]<i> First Lady vibes, yeah.</i>

23:52.631 --> 23:55.666
- Okay, I like it.
- Do you see this train? Do you see this?

23:55.700 --> 23:57.945
- [Monique] You look magical.
- [Krissy] Is this her or what?

23:57.969 --> 23:59.570
That is way better than mine.

24:00.839 --> 24:02.907
[Monique] It's sexy, it's fun.

24:02.941 --> 24:04.909
I feel like a queen.

24:04.943 --> 24:05.943
[gasps]

24:06.778 --> 24:08.446
[exclaims]

24:09.214 --> 24:12.917
This dress is everything on you.

24:12.951 --> 24:15.530
The more I look at it, the more
I wear it, the more I fall in love.

24:15.554 --> 24:16.687
[gasps] I said the I word.

24:18.190 --> 24:20.624
Nothing that I could have
ever imagined,

24:20.659 --> 24:24.094
<i>ever, I could have never
pulled for myself.</i>

24:24.129 --> 24:28.632
<i>But everything that I need is literally
staring back at me in this mirror.</i>

24:28.667 --> 24:31.001
<i>And I could not leave
that gown here.</i>

24:31.036 --> 24:33.137
<i>I just can't.</i> [chuckles]

24:33.171 --> 24:37.308
[Krissy] So are we asking you
the question on your first dress?

24:37.375 --> 24:39.710
- Yes.
- [Krissy]<i> Okay.</i>

24:40.545 --> 24:41.812
[Krissy and Randy] Laquesha...

24:42.647 --> 24:45.616
Are you saying yes to the dress?

24:45.650 --> 24:48.152
- I'm saying yes to the dress.
- [all cheering]

24:51.823 --> 24:53.858
[Krissy] Virtual hugs.

24:55.794 --> 25:00.264
This is a dress that very few
brides can actually wear and pull off.

25:00.298 --> 25:02.566
'Cause it is really extra.

25:02.601 --> 25:07.671
But let me tell you, she wears
this dress, it does not wear her.

25:07.706 --> 25:11.041
So do you wanna keep shopping
for the ceremony dress?

25:11.076 --> 25:14.211
Absolutely. Round two,
dress number two.

25:14.246 --> 25:15.779
All right.
I shall be back.

25:18.583 --> 25:20.862
- [Amber] Wait, let me recap, deep plunge.
- [Marissa] Yeah.

25:20.886 --> 25:23.821
Deep back. Lightweight train,
but long train.

25:23.855 --> 25:26.156
<i>And most importantly,
lightweight.</i>

25:26.191 --> 25:29.093
I'm a little stumped, I'm not
gonna lie. I'm not usually stumped.

25:29.127 --> 25:31.996
These poor women,
dealing with me.

25:32.030 --> 25:36.200
But it's not even so much the
list of things that Jessica wants,

25:36.234 --> 25:40.170
it's how is she feeling in the
gown and the weight of the gown.

25:40.205 --> 25:44.074
Wedding dresses are heavy, and I just don't
know if I can combine those two things

25:44.109 --> 25:45.175
for her right now.

25:45.210 --> 25:48.012
- Feel this dress. This is super light.
- Okay.

25:48.046 --> 25:50.347
I think she'll like this one.
What do you think?

25:50.382 --> 25:52.326
- Look, I'm, like, second guessing myself now.
- I know.

25:52.350 --> 25:54.685
- I'm like, "Will she like it?"
- It checks all the boxes.

25:55.420 --> 25:56.587
- [Amber] Jessica.
- Yes.

25:56.621 --> 25:58.332
- [Marissa] Hello.
- [Amber] We have dresses.

25:58.356 --> 26:00.190
- Oh, my God.
- Are you ready?

26:00.225 --> 26:02.560
- And we're really excited about it, too.
- [Jessica] Yes.

26:02.594 --> 26:04.028
[Marissa] So, first option...

26:05.163 --> 26:07.865
- [Jessica] Yeah.
- Is a Martina Liana.

26:12.737 --> 26:15.806
- Okay.
- It's similar to the one that you tried on first, I believe.

26:15.840 --> 26:19.476
Next is Signore.

26:19.511 --> 26:22.713
With a lot of beading
and then check out this back.

26:22.747 --> 26:25.282
Low back illusion, -buttons.

26:25.317 --> 26:27.428
- [Amber] Okay.
- [Marissa] Okay, last one is our favorite.

26:27.452 --> 26:28.986
- This one, Lazaro.
- [Jessica] Okay.

26:29.020 --> 26:32.756
[Amber] Really, really lightweight,
probably the lightest of them all.

26:32.791 --> 26:36.026
Glitter underneath with the floral
appliques. I'm trying to read your face

26:36.061 --> 26:38.095
and I can't read it.
Do you like it or no?

26:40.999 --> 26:42.232
- I don't.
- [Amber] No?

26:42.267 --> 26:44.568
- [Marissa] Oh, no!
- You know why?

26:44.603 --> 26:47.605
- [Amber] Why?
- I don't like the sparkle.

26:47.639 --> 26:48.872
You feel like it's too much?

26:48.907 --> 26:52.109
I feel like everything is too
much. What I want is too much.

26:52.143 --> 26:54.623
I don't wanna overwhelm you with
dresses, you know what I mean?

26:55.747 --> 26:57.548
It's just me.

26:57.582 --> 26:59.450
<i>I just feel like
I'm overshopping.</i>

26:59.484 --> 27:01.285
Let's slip this on. Okay.

27:01.319 --> 27:04.121
I feel like I hit the point
where they all look the same,

27:04.155 --> 27:06.690
and if I were to put
every single dress on,

27:06.725 --> 27:07.885
<i>I would still not like them.</i>

27:09.160 --> 27:10.561
- Do you like it?
- No.

27:10.595 --> 27:12.229
- No? The whole thing?
- What is this?

27:12.263 --> 27:15.032
- [Amber] It's, like, low on the side.
- I wish it was at...

27:15.066 --> 27:16.510
[Amber] It could be.
You could line it.

27:16.534 --> 27:18.546
You don't have to have, 'cause
you can't really wear underwear

27:18.570 --> 27:21.338
- when it's, like, this low, you know? No?
- [sighs]

27:22.140 --> 27:24.875
- [screams]
- That's okay. Let it out.

27:24.909 --> 27:26.010
I'm stressing.

27:26.044 --> 27:28.846
I'm all over.
I don't know what I want.

27:28.880 --> 27:30.414
I thought I did.
I don't.

27:31.316 --> 27:32.716
- [Amber] Jessica.
- Mm-hmm.

27:32.751 --> 27:36.320
You're so pretty, you don't need
all of this zhuzh all on a dress.

27:36.354 --> 27:38.288
You know, I think you're right.

27:38.323 --> 27:43.160
You literally could go
all white, ivory, all clean,

27:43.194 --> 27:44.962
- sexy, open back.
- Yeah.

27:44.996 --> 27:50.334
Open front, and just, like, be so striking
when you enter the room, you know?

27:50.368 --> 27:52.269
I don't think you need,
like, maybe that's it.

27:52.303 --> 27:54.872
I agree with Amber.
I think I need to...

27:54.906 --> 27:57.975
Break up with lace. I think I
need to have a break up talk

27:58.009 --> 28:00.110
with all the glitz
and the glam and...

28:00.779 --> 28:01.812
figure it out.

28:01.846 --> 28:03.190
We're gonna go home,
we're gonna think about this

28:03.214 --> 28:04.792
- and come back and try on clean.
- Okay.

28:04.816 --> 28:05.816
- Okay?
- Okay.

28:07.585 --> 28:09.665
Is this the one from over
there that she's trying on?

28:10.488 --> 28:11.488
Oh.

28:12.123 --> 28:13.123
What's going on?

28:15.994 --> 28:16.994
[Jessica] We...

28:18.797 --> 28:21.298
- Are going to take a break.
- A break?

28:21.332 --> 28:22.666
- [Jessica] A break.
- Okay.

28:22.701 --> 28:25.269
[Jessica] Because I'm
stressed, I'm overwhelmed.

28:26.805 --> 28:29.517
- Did you see, like... - But I also
felt like you guys are pressuring me,

28:29.541 --> 28:31.719
I really felt like you were trying
to put me with other dresses.

28:31.743 --> 28:33.077
We happen to love glitz, glamor,

28:33.111 --> 28:34.755
- and we just think... - But you
should put yourself in the dress,

28:34.779 --> 28:35.979
like, they were heavy.

28:36.014 --> 28:38.092
- I'm very proud of her for trying on...
- I feel kinda bad.

28:38.116 --> 28:40.951
I do think we pressured her a
little bit. I do feel a little bit bad.

28:40.985 --> 28:43.130
- We're only here to support, not pressure you.
- That's right.

28:43.154 --> 28:45.789
That's just what we loved and
we loved you in it, no matter what.

28:45.824 --> 28:48.792
- Right.
- So you look gorgeous in them. I mean, stunning.

28:48.827 --> 28:51.562
I was trying to please
my mom and my sister.

28:51.596 --> 28:53.397
But at the end of the day, like,

28:53.431 --> 28:55.766
they're not the ones going
down the aisle in the dress.

28:55.800 --> 28:57.101
- You guys ready?
- Yay!

28:57.135 --> 28:59.536
- All right. Thank you.
- [both clamoring]

28:59.538 --> 29:02.906
I'll be cutting
that laundry list in half.

29:02.941 --> 29:06.543
And the next time I go dress
shopping, it's gonna be me.

29:09.481 --> 29:12.249
It's been a long time
since they've been out.

29:12.283 --> 29:13.851
Oh, yeah,
I don't like this back.

29:13.885 --> 29:15.352
You don't like it.
Okay.

29:15.386 --> 29:18.756
I think the odds are slim that
Laquesha's gonna find another dress today.

29:18.790 --> 29:21.191
So let's move on
from this dress.

29:21.226 --> 29:24.361
- Okay.
- We're a couple blocks away from Kleinfeld's

29:24.395 --> 29:25.996
for my last dress fitting.

29:26.030 --> 29:29.800
Today, I'm coming in and I'm
praying that everything is here.

29:29.834 --> 29:31.535
[Joanne] Do we have the skirt?

29:42.814 --> 29:45.334
[salesgirl] You have to look
hot. That goes right into the lace.

29:45.683 --> 29:47.384
[woman] So pretty.

29:47.418 --> 29:49.263
[Laquesha] I don't know how
we're gonna top this, Krissy.

29:49.287 --> 29:51.855
[Krissy] I know.
This is, like, so on point.

29:54.092 --> 29:57.795
So Laquesha said yes
to her reception gown

29:57.829 --> 29:59.830
and I feel so good about it.

29:59.864 --> 30:03.867
But I'm also super worried that,
like, we can't get that same buildup

30:03.902 --> 30:05.302
for the second dress.

30:05.336 --> 30:07.638
Romance. Glam. Romance.

30:08.506 --> 30:11.041
Okay, Queyonce.
Yeah, Queyonce.

30:11.075 --> 30:14.778
And that's an issue that, a lot
of times, us as bridal consultants,

30:14.813 --> 30:18.749
we run into when somebody
really loves a gown.

30:18.783 --> 30:21.985
Now they're comparing to that
one the feeling that they've got.

30:22.020 --> 30:24.955
But should I shop...
I'm gonna let her decide.

30:24.989 --> 30:27.457
But I feel like
this is more Queyonce.

30:27.492 --> 30:29.326
- Are you coming in hot?
- I'm coming in hot.

30:29.360 --> 30:31.762
- Ooh.
- And I'm coming in with two.

30:31.796 --> 30:35.933
- Those... Oh, ooh, okay.
- Yeah.

30:35.967 --> 30:39.069
I said I was gonna try to,
like, do the one trip,

30:39.103 --> 30:42.406
but then I was like, "But both
say Laquesha in a different way."

30:42.440 --> 30:44.741
- They do.
- This is, like, glam boom.

30:44.776 --> 30:46.977
- And this is, like, romantic boom.
- Romance, yeah.

30:47.011 --> 30:51.315
Let's start with the, uh,
all... Yeah, this one.

30:51.349 --> 30:52.626
- Let's start with this one.
- Yeah.

30:52.650 --> 30:54.585
- Yeah, for sure.
- Okay, yeah!

30:54.619 --> 30:57.254
I'm super confident
that my dress is here.

30:57.288 --> 30:59.623
<i>Krissy knows exactly
what she's doing,</i>

30:59.657 --> 31:02.125
<i>and she's gonna make sure
that I leave here today</i>

31:02.160 --> 31:04.962
if not with one, but two gowns.

31:04.996 --> 31:07.965
So tell me. What do you
think about this dress?

31:07.999 --> 31:11.201
I love the way that it shapes,
it forms, fits to my body.

31:11.236 --> 31:14.004
I don't know how to feel
about this part.

31:14.038 --> 31:16.874
- Got you.
- But, well, like, at least the shape of the neck.

31:16.908 --> 31:20.344
Do you think we should
go to the next one?

31:20.378 --> 31:23.347
- Oh, yeah, I don't like this back.
- You don't like it. Okay.

31:23.381 --> 31:25.148
So let's move on
from this dress.

31:28.553 --> 31:30.497
[Randy]<i> It's been a long time</i>
<i>since they've been out.</i>

31:30.521 --> 31:33.190
I don't know what's happening
behind the doors.

31:33.224 --> 31:36.159
She's trying on dresses
that she doesn't like.

31:36.194 --> 31:37.861
So she's not coming out in them.

31:37.896 --> 31:40.197
That's probably it.

31:40.231 --> 31:44.034
I think the odds are slim that Quesha's
gonna find another dress today.

31:44.068 --> 31:46.937
'Cause she's...
Quesha's hard to please.

31:46.971 --> 31:49.139
Like, she knows what she likes,

31:49.173 --> 31:51.819
and if she doesn't love it, if it
doesn't wow her, if it's not over the top,

31:51.843 --> 31:53.844
it's not gonna...
It's not happening.

31:53.878 --> 31:56.280
- And she will let you know.
- Yeah.

31:56.314 --> 31:59.516
[Laquesha]
<i>♪ She's your queen to be ♪</i>

31:59.550 --> 32:04.054
[Krissy] Exactly.
It's royal. We've got a vibe.

32:04.088 --> 32:07.958
- [Laquesha] Yeah.
- I mean, oh, my goodness. Look how gorgeous.

32:07.992 --> 32:10.594
- Look how good your butt looks. It's like...
- [whispering] Wow.

32:11.296 --> 32:12.462
- Hello.
- This is pretty.

32:12.497 --> 32:16.166
And this is, like,
elegant, romantic, sexy.

32:16.234 --> 32:19.770
Literally, it slipped on me
like a glove.

32:19.804 --> 32:21.939
<i>Each and every curve it hugged</i>

32:21.973 --> 32:24.441
<i>as if every finger was sliding
into each</i>

32:24.475 --> 32:25.842
and every pocket of a glove.

32:25.877 --> 32:28.512
It literally was like
it was made for me.

32:28.546 --> 32:31.415
I don't like if they're gonna love
this more than they did the last one.

32:32.417 --> 32:34.351
I don't know if
they're gonna pick it apart.

32:34.385 --> 32:36.553
They may not like
the detail here.

32:37.422 --> 32:38.422
Um, but we'll see.

32:42.560 --> 32:44.528
[Randy]<i> Let me see.</i>
<i>Is she coming out?</i>

32:44.562 --> 32:46.630
- Yes!
<i>- Let me see!</i>

32:49.534 --> 32:51.401
[Krissy] This is Maggie Sotero.

32:51.436 --> 32:54.871
This is the Beta gown.
It fits her so beautifully.

32:56.574 --> 32:58.175
That's what I'm talking about!

32:58.209 --> 32:59.443
[all laughing]

32:59.477 --> 33:01.178
- [A.J.] This is nice.
- Yeah?

33:01.212 --> 33:04.147
- [laughs] Okay.
- [Krissy] So royal.

33:04.182 --> 33:06.783
- Look at the queen.
- [all cheer and laugh]

33:06.818 --> 33:11.588
OMG. This looks like
a million bucks.

33:11.622 --> 33:13.434
- [Krissy] Right?
<i>- [Randy] How do you feel, Laquesha?</i>

33:13.458 --> 33:16.159
I feel regal.

33:16.194 --> 33:21.365
I feel like a queen. I look like a
bride. Wait till you see the back.

33:22.433 --> 33:23.867
- [A.J.] Nice.
- Ooh.

33:25.203 --> 33:27.070
Oh, my gosh!

33:27.105 --> 33:28.472
Love the back.

33:28.506 --> 33:31.108
Super pretty.
The back is just everything.

33:31.142 --> 33:32.676
[A.J.] I love this.

33:33.945 --> 33:37.447
- [Laquesha chuckles] Oh, don't cry!
- [A.J.] Aww!

33:37.482 --> 33:40.050
If you cry, I'm gonna cry, too.

33:40.618 --> 33:42.853
I love the back.

33:42.887 --> 33:46.957
Everything that I want in a gown,
every response, every reaction

33:46.991 --> 33:51.795
<i>that I want from everyone in
attendance at my wedding was confirmed.</i>

33:51.829 --> 33:53.530
<i>Just from seeing her tears.</i>

33:53.564 --> 33:57.334
It's sexy,
it's regal, it's elegant.

33:57.368 --> 34:00.070
I don't know what else to say
about... And it's hugging her...

34:00.938 --> 34:02.773
Her body is so beautiful.

34:06.110 --> 34:07.711
Are you ready for a veil?

34:07.745 --> 34:09.346
[Laquesha] I'm ready
for a veil, yes.

34:09.380 --> 34:12.582
Without a veil, you're just
a pretty girl in a white dress.

34:12.617 --> 34:15.852
<i>- Do I lie?
- I'm gonna go grab the perfect one.</i>

34:15.887 --> 34:17.988
Quesha is a tough person.

34:18.022 --> 34:19.523
<i>She's always got it on.</i>

34:20.124 --> 34:22.159
Oh, Quesh...

34:22.193 --> 34:27.898
So you don't really get to see
her be unguarded that way, so...

34:27.932 --> 34:29.766
- It's special to see her cry.
- Very special.

34:32.937 --> 34:33.937
[Laquesha] Oh, wow.

34:34.739 --> 34:36.773
- This is it.
- You feel it.

34:38.342 --> 34:40.744
[both] Laquesha!

34:40.778 --> 34:43.980
Are you saying yes to the dress?

34:44.015 --> 34:45.782
- Yes!
- [all cheering]

34:49.887 --> 34:53.523
[Laquesha]<i> I cannot wait to
walk down the aisle to Des</i>

34:53.558 --> 34:55.759
<i>and say our "I dos".</i>

34:55.793 --> 34:58.595
<i>I honest and truly believe
that this gown</i>

34:58.629 --> 35:01.665
is going to have him
stop dead in his tracks.

35:01.699 --> 35:04.868
- [all laughing]
- Two dresses in one day!

35:04.902 --> 35:07.370
- Two dresses, one day.
<i>- Oh, my gosh!</i>

35:07.405 --> 35:09.773
This is history. [laughs]

35:10.341 --> 35:12.609
Do we have the skirt?

35:12.643 --> 35:14.411
[woman]<i> She has the overskirt.</i>

35:14.445 --> 35:17.380
The overskirt, it wasn't
actually at the store yet.

35:17.415 --> 35:19.716
And the wedding's so close.

35:19.750 --> 35:20.851
[Joanne] We're in trouble.

35:26.824 --> 35:31.027
We're a couple of blocks away from
Kleinfeld's for my last dress fitting.

35:31.062 --> 35:34.030
- I'm so excited. Mom is here with me.
- Yes.

35:34.065 --> 35:35.765
[Isabella]<i> So this is it.</i>

35:37.101 --> 35:40.370
I'm so excited
to get into my dress.

35:40.404 --> 35:42.506
I cannot wait to see
the final product.

35:42.540 --> 35:46.243
I have just been waiting
for this moment for so long.

35:48.479 --> 35:50.747
<i>I'm an ICU critical care nurse.</i>

35:50.781 --> 35:54.684
Usually, a typical day, I go
in, I take care of my patients.

35:54.719 --> 35:58.388
And leave.
With COVID, it's been...

35:58.422 --> 36:00.090
<i>Different.
Very different.</i>

36:00.124 --> 36:02.259
I have my goggles, my two masks.

36:02.293 --> 36:07.297
I'm just so grateful to still be
able to have my wedding next year.

36:07.331 --> 36:09.466
So that's what I'm focusing on.

36:09.500 --> 36:11.278
- [Joanne] This is it?
- [Isabella] Yeah, this is it.

36:11.302 --> 36:12.969
- Mm-hmm.
- I love this.

36:13.971 --> 36:15.305
[Isabella] It's perfect.

36:15.339 --> 36:17.807
- [Joanne] That is stunning.
- Mm-hmm.

36:17.842 --> 36:20.911
[Isabella]<i> I absolutely love</i>
<i>the overskirt with this dress,</i>

36:20.945 --> 36:25.182
I think it just elevates it,
it gives it that wow factor.

36:25.216 --> 36:27.984
[Joanne] I mean, this is what
you envisioned for yourself.

36:29.020 --> 36:30.654
Wow. My God.

36:30.688 --> 36:34.824
[salesgirl] I think this is, like, my first
time asking the question behind Plexi,

36:34.859 --> 36:38.562
- but are you saying yes to the dress?
- I am.

36:40.198 --> 36:41.464
I'm so happy.

36:43.134 --> 36:45.479
- [Joanne] I hope the skirt's here.
- [Isabella] I know. Me, too.

36:45.503 --> 36:47.671
Yeah. If it's not,
we're in trouble.

36:49.807 --> 36:53.476
[Lule] Hi. She has the
overskirt. Can you bring it to me?

36:53.511 --> 36:55.155
- [woman 2] Yes, I can.
- [Lule] Thank you.

36:55.179 --> 36:59.616
So my last fitting went great.
Everything was fitting perfect,

36:59.650 --> 37:02.219
<i>it felt like a glove on.</i>

37:02.253 --> 37:05.689
<i>The only issue we ran
into was the overskirt.</i>

37:05.723 --> 37:08.225
<i>It wasn't actually
at the store yet.</i>

37:08.259 --> 37:12.062
So today, I'm coming in and
I'm praying that everything is here.

37:12.964 --> 37:14.364
- [Lule] Hello.
- [Isabella] hi!

37:14.398 --> 37:16.132
- How are you? I'm good.
- How are you?

37:16.167 --> 37:18.401
Okay, my name is Lule.
I'm gonna be your fitter.

37:18.436 --> 37:20.637
- Great.
- [Joanne] Very nice. Nice to meet you.

37:20.671 --> 37:23.773
- One question, though. Do we have the skirt?
- [Lule] Sure.

37:25.176 --> 37:27.410
- Of course we have a skirt.
- Okay, great.

37:27.445 --> 37:29.212
- Oh, thank God!
- Okay, great.

37:29.247 --> 37:30.424
- Perfect.
- [Isabella] Thank you.

37:30.448 --> 37:33.049
- [Lule] Let's go. You can go first if you want to.
- Okay.

37:33.084 --> 37:34.361
[Lule] When it's gonna be,
the wedding?

37:34.385 --> 37:37.153
- [Isabella] Eleven days.
- [Lule] Eleven days, that's so close!

37:37.188 --> 37:39.389
[Isabella] I know.

37:39.423 --> 37:42.525
[Joanne]<i> When Bella and
Dakota first met in high school,</i>

37:42.560 --> 37:45.929
I was a little suspect, 'cause she
was a freshman and he was a junior.

37:45.963 --> 37:48.031
That was a big difference
back then.

37:48.065 --> 37:51.534
<i>But my husband and I both said
after they saw each other for a little bit</i>

37:51.602 --> 37:52.969
<i>and they were dating,</i>

37:53.004 --> 37:56.506
we both said to each other, "You
watch. They're gonna get married."

37:56.540 --> 37:58.341
<i>- And it happened.</i>
- [Isabella]<i> He's great.</i>

37:58.376 --> 38:00.410
[Joanne]<i> Yeah, he's such</i>
<i>a good guy.</i>

38:00.444 --> 38:05.448
Our wedding is at St Catherine's
cathedral in Allentown, Pennsylvania,

38:05.483 --> 38:09.119
<i>and then the reception is at
Folino winery.</i>

38:09.153 --> 38:14.057
And I'm just so excited. It's
felt like such a long time coming.

38:14.091 --> 38:16.192
- Can't wait. See you soon.
- Yes.

38:17.928 --> 38:19.696
[Lule] Okay. Okay.

38:20.998 --> 38:24.901
- Wow, that's so pretty.
- [Isabella] Oh, my gosh.

38:24.935 --> 38:29.572
I love it. It's gonna be different finally
seeing the overskirt with the dress.

38:29.607 --> 38:30.974
- I can't wait.
- [Lule] Exactly.

38:31.008 --> 38:34.110
If you put overskirt, you look
like you have different dress now.

38:34.145 --> 38:35.979
[Isabella] I know, I can't wait.

38:36.013 --> 38:40.383
I'm a little nervous. I feel
like it's gonna look wonderful.

38:40.418 --> 38:42.218
[Lule] Just put the one feet.

38:42.253 --> 38:45.422
But for it being
the first time I'm seeing it

38:45.456 --> 38:49.326
and the wedding's so close,
it is a little nerve-wracking.

38:49.360 --> 38:53.296
- [Lule] Okay.
- [Joanne]<i> I'm feeling a little nervous</i>

38:53.331 --> 38:57.567
to see how it all comes together
and that it looks right, and it's okay.

38:59.270 --> 39:02.806
- Oh, my gosh!
- That's beautiful. That's so pretty.

39:02.840 --> 39:05.975
Oh, my gosh! Wow.

39:06.010 --> 39:13.116
The skirt is everything I've dreamed of. It
came out better than I expected. I'm so happy.

39:13.150 --> 39:14.851
[Lule] Okay.

39:18.689 --> 39:20.457
- There you go.
- Ohh.

39:20.491 --> 39:23.360
It is beautiful.

39:24.829 --> 39:28.965
- Do you love it?
- I love it. It's so perfect.

39:29.033 --> 39:31.468
- It just changes it.
- [Lule] The overskirt.

39:31.502 --> 39:33.103
- Entirely.
- [Joanne] Yes.

39:33.137 --> 39:37.607
It's the statement piece of the
dress that we were waiting for.

39:37.641 --> 39:39.576
- Gorgeous!
- [Isabella] I know.

39:40.378 --> 39:42.412
- Oh, my goodness.
- Don't cry.

39:44.415 --> 39:45.815
[Joanne]<i> After the year we had</i>

39:45.850 --> 39:49.052
<i>and realizing that we're going
to be able to have the wedding</i>

39:49.086 --> 39:51.521
of her dreams
is a dream come true.

39:52.723 --> 39:54.824
Oh...

39:54.859 --> 39:56.659
You're gonna be
the most beautiful bride.

39:57.695 --> 39:59.629
Dakota's gonna be floored.

39:59.663 --> 40:01.531
[Isabella] I know.
I think so, too.

40:03.367 --> 40:04.934
Yeah.

40:04.969 --> 40:08.204
I can't wait
to see Dakota's face.

40:08.239 --> 40:12.308
<i>Walking down that aisle is
gonna be absolutely amazing.</i>

40:12.343 --> 40:15.245
- You said yes to the right dress.
- I sure did.

40:25.256 --> 40:27.357
- It's perfect.
- So beautiful.

40:31.595 --> 40:34.197
[Isabella]<i> I can't wait</i>
<i>to walk down the aisle.</i>

40:34.231 --> 40:36.833
It's finally here and I'm
all dressed, all ready.

40:36.867 --> 40:38.668
It feels so real.

40:43.340 --> 40:46.843
<i>I wanna remember
every moment of this day,</i>

40:46.877 --> 40:49.913
<i>and I just wanna finally
marry the man of my dreams.</i>

41:02.560 --> 41:06.429
[priest] We have come here at
the invitation of Isabella and Dakota.

41:06.464 --> 41:11.267
[Isabella]<i> Once those doors opened
up, I saw Dakota and I was just...</i>

41:11.302 --> 41:15.038
<i>So happy, crying, felt like
so many different emotions.</i>

41:15.072 --> 41:17.240
- I, Isabella...
- I, Isabella...

41:17.274 --> 41:19.209
- Take you, Dakota...
- Take you, Dakota...

41:19.243 --> 41:21.845
I vow to love you
for who you are,

41:21.879 --> 41:24.013
and who you have yet to become.

41:24.048 --> 41:27.016
I promise to work every day
to stay worthy of your love.

41:27.051 --> 41:29.586
You have always had
my entire heart.

41:29.620 --> 41:31.354
Since the very first
day I met you.

41:31.388 --> 41:34.724
How blessed I am to be
marrying my very best friend.

41:34.758 --> 41:38.495
[priest]<i> May I present to you for the
first time Mr. and Mrs. Dakota Kravelick.</i>

41:49.907 --> 41:52.942
[Isabella]<i> My dress made me</i>
<i>feel so perfect today.</i>

41:52.977 --> 41:56.012
<i>I felt like an absolute
princess walking down the aisle.</i>

41:56.046 --> 41:58.781
It was perfect.
Everything I wanted.

42:00.551 --> 42:01.985
[all cheering]

42:06.056 --> 42:09.759
[Dakota]<i> I mean, it's amazing because I've
been looking forward to this for years now.</i>

42:09.793 --> 42:13.763
We've been engaged almost two years.
I've been, I think, ready longer than that,

42:13.797 --> 42:17.567
<i>so it just is, like, finally
everything's come together</i>

42:17.601 --> 42:19.669
and it just feels right,
feels perfect, so

42:19.703 --> 42:22.405
<i>I'm just so excited to see
what happens next,</i>

42:22.439 --> 42:25.341
<i>- where we go and everything to come.</i>
- [Isabella]<i> Mm-hmm.</i>
