What's up?

00:29.963 --> 00:31.396
Something big.

00:35.902 --> 00:37.102

Keep watching.

00:39.206 --> 00:40.439
(BEEPING)

00:42.275 --> 00:46.044
Zod? But we trapped him
in the Phantom Zone
with the other Kryptonians.

00:46.079 --> 00:50.816
It appears this explosion
opened a temporary rift
between the zones.

00:50.851 --> 00:52.884
Zod escaped before it closed.

00:52.919 --> 00:54.086
When did this happen?

00:54.121 --> 00:56.254
The last half hour.

00:56.289 --> 00:59.658

(KEYBOARD CLICKING)

01:17.944 --> 01:19.678
Zod will try to free the
other Kryptonian criminals,

01:19.713 --> 01:20.946
now that he's escaped.

01:20.981 --> 01:22.747
Wouldn't he need the Phantom
Projector for that?

01:22.782 --> 01:24.416
(BEEPING)

01:24.451 --> 01:26.151
SUPERMAN: There's something
at S.T.A.R. Labs
that might help him.

01:26.186 --> 01:28.186
If Zod should get
his hands on it...

01:28.221 --> 01:30.088
We should head over
there right away.

01:59.853 --> 02:01.186
Do not worry, Faora.

02:01.221 --> 02:03.221
Soon we shall be reunited.

02:03.256 --> 02:04.590
If you miss them
so much, Zod,

02:05.959 --> 02:07.526
we'll gladly send you back.

02:38.825 --> 02:39.858
That went smoothly.

02:39.893 --> 02:41.726
A quick victory
is still a victory.

02:41.761 --> 02:44.429
Some sort of energy
came off the prism.

02:44.464 --> 02:46.765
I've never seen a piece
of Krypton that
looked like this.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.934
Even so, I think
we should keep this
at the Watchtower

02:48.969 --> 02:50.169
for the time being.

02:54.908 --> 02:57.175
(LAUGHS EVILLY)

02:57.210 --> 03:00.579
SUPERMAN: It's one of the only
remains from my planet that
didn't turn into Kryptonite.

03:00.614 --> 03:02.948
The scientists at
S.T.A.R. Labs
wanted to study it.

03:02.983 --> 03:06.218
The prism is a gateway
between our existence
and the Phantom Zone.

03:06.253 --> 03:10.121
I can see the other Kryptonian
prisoners trapped inside.

03:10.156 --> 03:11.756
Strange. Zod's not with them.

03:11.791 --> 03:12.791
Hey!

03:14.427 --> 03:17.529
(GASPS) I do not know
how that happened.

03:20.233 --> 03:21.733
This is bad.

03:21.768 --> 03:22.734
Very bad.

03:22.769 --> 03:24.569
I can't alert the others
in this state.

03:24.604 --> 03:26.838
The prism's energy
must have had
a delayed effect.

03:26.873 --> 03:29.708
Look! We're phasing out
of existence.

03:29.743 --> 03:32.244
Can we unphase ourselves
with the projector?

03:32.279 --> 03:34.312
Not without help.

03:34.347 --> 03:36.181
And we'll need to do it soon
before we phase completely
into the Phantom Zone.

03:36.216 --> 03:38.750
