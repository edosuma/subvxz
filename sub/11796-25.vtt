00:02.168 --> 00:04.137
( bell rings )

00:04.170 --> 00:06.806
<i>* When I wake up in the</i>
<i>morning and the alarm</i>
<i>gives out a warning</i>

00:06.840 --> 00:09.676
<i>* I don't think</i>
<i>I'll ever make it on time</i>

00:09.709 --> 00:12.445
<i>* By the time I grab my books</i>
<i>and I give myself a look</i>

00:12.479 --> 00:16.216
<i>* I'm at the corner</i>
<i>just in time</i>
<i>to see the bus fly by</i>

00:16.248 --> 00:21.921
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:21.955 --> 00:24.824
<i>* If the teacher pops a test</i>
<i>I know I'm in a mess</i>

00:24.858 --> 00:27.961
<i>* And my dog ate</i>
<i>all my homework last night</i>

00:27.994 --> 00:30.897
<i>* Ridin' low in my chair</i>
<i>She won't know that I'm there</i>

00:30.930 --> 00:34.501
<i>* If I can hand it in tomorrow</i>
<i>it'll be all right</i>

00:34.534 --> 00:38.271
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell</i>

00:52.686 --> 00:55.722
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the...</i>

00:55.755 --> 00:58.591
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the...</i>

00:58.625 --> 01:01.961
<i>* It's all right</i>
<i>'Cause I'm saved by the bell *</i>

01:19.212 --> 01:21.081
It's Christmas vacation

01:21.114 --> 01:23.149
and some of my friends
have jobs at the mall.

01:23.183 --> 01:26.920
Slater is
working at Gift Wrap.
He has a real knack for it.

01:26.953 --> 01:28.455
There you are.

01:28.488 --> 01:33.259
I'm sure your daughter
will love
the champagne glasses.

01:33.293 --> 01:35.695
Zack:
<i>Screech had a little trouble</i>
<i>with the gift he bought.</i>

01:35.729 --> 01:38.098
I want to make sure it works.

01:42.202 --> 01:44.270
I think it works.

01:44.304 --> 01:47.407
Oh my gosh! It won't stop!
What do I do?

01:47.440 --> 01:49.676
Zack: <i>The mall's an exciting</i>
<i>place at Christmas.</i>

01:49.709 --> 01:51.277
<i>You never know</i>
<i>who you'll run into.</i>

01:51.311 --> 01:53.313
- Jeez, I'm sorry.
- Watch where you're going!

01:53.346 --> 01:55.115
Sorry, I didn't see you.

01:55.115 --> 01:58.418
Boy, I'm sure glad
I bumped into you.

01:58.451 --> 02:01.621
- I'm Zack Morris.
- I'm... late for work.

02:01.654 --> 02:05.158
Zack: <i>Her name is Laura, and I</i>
<i>found out she</i>
<i>worked with Kelly.</i>

02:05.191 --> 02:06.926
Thinking about Zack again?

02:06.960 --> 02:09.696
I can't believe he took me
to see Santa Claus.

02:09.729 --> 02:12.065
I'm surprised he didn't
make you sit on his knee.

02:12.098 --> 02:14.067
He's really fun.
Look.

02:14.067 --> 02:15.735
Both: How cute!

02:15.769 --> 02:18.505
Zack: <i>Not everyone comes</i>
<i>to the mall to shop.</i>

02:18.538 --> 02:20.707
Screech,
I think he's homeless.

02:20.740 --> 02:21.975
Then he should eat out.

02:22.075 --> 02:24.511
He doesn't have
a place to live.

02:24.544 --> 02:26.246
Oh.

02:26.279 --> 02:28.081
Both: Oh!

02:28.114 --> 02:30.417
Zack: <i>Sometimes one problem</i>
<i>leads to another.</i>

02:30.450 --> 02:32.485
- Guys, look who it is.
- Oh no!

02:32.519 --> 02:34.421
Come on, let's help him!
Excuse me. Back up!

02:34.454 --> 02:37.090
- Is he still alive?
- Are you okay?

02:37.090 --> 02:39.225
<i>And when we went</i>
<i>to see him at the hospital,</i>

02:39.259 --> 02:41.094
<i>we got a big surprise.</i>

02:42.228 --> 02:44.864
Laura?
What are you doing here?

02:44.898 --> 02:47.100
Visiting.
He's my father.

02:50.837 --> 02:54.374
So,
Laura, why didn't you tell us
he was your father?

02:54.407 --> 02:57.577
I guess she
didn't want to brag.

02:57.610 --> 03:02.115
Zack,
Slater, Screech, I'd like you
to meet my dad, Frank Benton.

03:02.148 --> 03:04.784
We met.
They saved my life.

03:04.818 --> 03:06.619
- No problem.
- Yeah.

03:06.653 --> 03:08.722
So, Mr. Benton,
how are you feeling?

03:08.755 --> 03:10.590
Much better.

03:10.623 --> 03:12.125
The doctor just
wants to check him
again in an hour.

03:12.158 --> 03:14.260
If he's still okay,
they'll release him.

03:14.294 --> 03:16.096
Great!
So nothing's wrong?

03:16.129 --> 03:19.432
The doctor did say I should
do something about my diet.

03:19.466 --> 03:21.101
- What?
- Eat.

03:21.134 --> 03:23.770
Maybe you ought to open
this present we brought you.

03:23.803 --> 03:27.507
- There you go.
- I can tell who wrapped it.

03:27.540 --> 03:29.909
I do have
a unique style, don't I?

03:29.943 --> 03:32.946
Cookies!
Just what the doctor ordered.

03:32.979 --> 03:36.216
Who's your doctor?
Famous Amos?

03:36.249 --> 03:38.418
When they release you,
why don't you and Laura

03:38.451 --> 03:41.087
come to my house for dinner,
have a real meal?

03:41.087 --> 03:43.590
- Zack, we couldn't do that.
- Why not?

03:43.623 --> 03:46.559
You can't spring two
dinner guests on your
parents at the last minute.

03:46.593 --> 03:47.894
My dad is out of town.

03:47.927 --> 03:50.463
My mom says the house
seems empty for the holidays.

03:50.497 --> 03:52.499
She'd love to
have people over.

03:52.532 --> 03:54.734
So come on!
What do you say?

03:54.768 --> 03:56.770
I'd say you got
two more for dinner.

03:56.803 --> 03:59.706
All right! Terrific!

03:59.739 --> 04:01.574
Frank,
have another piece of pie?

04:01.608 --> 04:04.511
No, thanks.
Three's my limit.

04:04.544 --> 04:06.379
- What about you, Laura?
- No, thanks.

04:06.413 --> 04:08.381
After four potatoes
and five lamb chops,

04:08.415 --> 04:11.051
I feel like
I've put on 10 lbs.

04:11.051 --> 04:13.053
Looks great to me.

04:13.053 --> 04:15.555
It's a shame my husband's
out of town.

04:15.588 --> 04:19.159
He loves meeting different
kinds of people. I mean...

04:19.192 --> 04:22.562
You mean, you've never known
any homeless people before?

04:22.595 --> 04:26.499
No, no, Mom means people
with... big appetites

04:26.533 --> 04:28.368
who pass out in malls.

04:28.401 --> 04:30.103
I'm sorry.

04:30.136 --> 04:32.305
It's okay, Zack.

04:32.339 --> 04:35.408
Inever knew any homeless
people before either...

04:35.442 --> 04:36.810
till I became one.

04:37.444 --> 04:39.079
Well...

04:39.112 --> 04:40.847
how did it happen?

04:40.880 --> 04:43.717
Zack, maybe Frank would
rather not talk about it.

04:43.750 --> 04:47.253
No, I don't mind.
It didn't happen all at once.

04:47.287 --> 04:50.457
First, the computer plant
that I worked in closed down.

04:50.490 --> 04:52.292
I couldn't find another job.

04:52.325 --> 04:55.261
Then one month,
the rent was due
and I didn't have it.

04:55.295 --> 04:56.896
So we were homeless.

04:56.930 --> 04:59.666
We drove out to California
hoping to find
better opportunities.

04:59.699 --> 05:02.369
But all I found
was a warmer place
to be unemployed.

05:02.402 --> 05:04.104
Dad's tried to get jobs.

05:04.137 --> 05:05.538
I guess it's hard.

05:05.572 --> 05:07.574
Yeah, I go for an interview,

05:07.607 --> 05:11.211
but I have no home address,
no phone number and
just one rumpled suit,

05:11.244 --> 05:13.847
so they hire someone else
every time.

05:15.181 --> 05:18.051
Dad, it's getting late.
We'd better go.

05:18.051 --> 05:20.687
- Do you have a place to stay?
- We're okay.

05:20.720 --> 05:22.722
But thank you
for a wonderful meal.

05:22.756 --> 05:24.057
It was our pleasure.

05:24.090 --> 05:26.326
Laura, we'll see you
tomorrow at the play.

05:26.359 --> 05:29.562
I'm sorry, but my boss
won't give me the time off.

05:29.596 --> 05:32.766
- Man, what a jerk.
- Maybe, but that
jerk's still my boss,

05:32.799 --> 05:35.602
and right now,
that job's all we've got.

05:40.306 --> 05:43.076
There must be something
we can do for you.

05:43.109 --> 05:44.778
We've been in California
for two months,

05:44.811 --> 05:47.313
and you're the first people
to invite us into your home.

05:47.347 --> 05:50.517
You have done a lot.
Good night.

05:50.550 --> 05:53.286
Thanks for
asking us over, Zack.

05:53.319 --> 05:56.423
- Good night, Zack.
- Good night, Mrs. Morris.

06:12.372 --> 06:14.741
I really appreciate you guys
pitching in and helping me.

06:14.774 --> 06:16.242
No problem, Mom.

06:16.276 --> 06:18.211
There's nothing I'd rather do
on my Christmas vacation

06:18.244 --> 06:21.715
than get up at 7:00
in the morning and work...

06:21.748 --> 06:23.249
for free.

06:24.517 --> 06:26.219
I'm tired.

06:26.252 --> 06:28.355
Hey, Zack, want
some of my breakfast?

06:28.388 --> 06:29.856
It'll help you wake up.

06:29.889 --> 06:32.692
Egg foo young and
extra garlic sauce.

06:32.726 --> 06:34.494
Mmm!

06:35.261 --> 06:37.330
Help yourself, buddy.

06:39.065 --> 06:40.734
No, thanks... and please,

06:40.767 --> 06:43.937
don't breathe near me
for the rest of your life.

06:45.438 --> 06:48.074
- Good morning, Zack.
- Good morning.

06:48.108 --> 06:50.377
- What are you
doing up so early?
- Early?

06:50.410 --> 06:53.446
- I love getting up early.
- Really?

06:55.982 --> 06:59.085
Especially when
I have a chance
to take you out for breakfast.

06:59.085 --> 07:03.023
Breakfast?
I'd love to, but I have
to be to work in five minutes.

07:03.023 --> 07:05.658
Haven't you ever heard
of fast food?

07:06.926 --> 07:09.596
- There you go. Have one.
- Thank you.

07:09.629 --> 07:11.197
No, have two. Have a dozen.

07:11.231 --> 07:12.866
One's plenty, Zack. Thanks.

07:12.899 --> 07:14.334
Okay.

07:15.035 --> 07:16.603
You want to sit?

07:16.636 --> 07:18.905
It's really nice
having a friend again.

07:18.938 --> 07:20.573
What do you mean?

07:20.607 --> 07:22.308
People shy away
when you're homeless.

07:22.342 --> 07:24.077
It's like they
think it's contagious.

07:24.110 --> 07:26.046
I'm sure things will change.

07:26.079 --> 07:28.248
That's what I told myself
six months ago.

07:28.281 --> 07:30.350
Now I'm not so sure.

07:30.383 --> 07:32.686
You know what I miss the most?

07:32.719 --> 07:36.222
Little things, like closing
the door to my own bedroom,

07:36.256 --> 07:40.527
turning on some music
and talking to my friends
on the telephone.

07:40.560 --> 07:42.629
I'm sure things
will get better,

07:42.662 --> 07:44.330
and when they do,

07:44.364 --> 07:46.866
I hope I'll be
the first one you call.

07:46.900 --> 07:50.136
Hey, Laura, want some
sweet and sour squid?

07:51.471 --> 07:54.341
No thanks.
Even I'm not that hungry.

08:02.782 --> 08:04.751
- Nice sports coat, isn't it?
- Yeah...

08:04.784 --> 08:07.087
just what my dad needs
for job interviews.

08:07.120 --> 08:08.922
But I don't have enough money.

08:09.022 --> 08:12.359
Why don't you ask Mr. Moody
for an advance on your salary?

08:12.392 --> 08:14.527
- I don't know.
- He'll be happy to
give you the money

08:14.561 --> 08:16.796
if he knows he's
getting it right back.

08:16.830 --> 08:18.164
Think so?

08:18.198 --> 08:20.667
Sure, but you better ask
before someone else grabs it.

08:25.839 --> 08:28.174
Mr. Moody?

08:28.208 --> 08:30.510
I'd like to buy
that sports coat...

08:30.543 --> 08:34.246
I was wondering if I could get
an advance on my salary.

08:34.280 --> 08:36.616
Stop wondering.
No!

08:41.621 --> 08:43.323
Please, Mr. Moody.

08:43.356 --> 08:46.626
This is Laura's only chance
to buy a Christmas
present for her father!

08:46.659 --> 08:49.863
She's homeless.

08:49.896 --> 08:53.166
If I knew she was homeless,
I wouldn't have hired her.

08:53.199 --> 08:55.935
People like that steal.

08:55.969 --> 08:57.637
Come on, Mr. Moody.

08:57.671 --> 09:01.007
Laura just needs a small favor
to buy that jacket.

09:03.510 --> 09:06.346
- Hey, Laura.
- Hi, Zack.

09:06.379 --> 09:09.015
Could I interest
you in something
more contemporary?

09:09.015 --> 09:13.453
Thanks, but it wouldn't
work on Bob Cratchit.

09:13.486 --> 09:17.123
Excuse me. Kelly! Come on!
Time to get
ready for the show.

09:17.157 --> 09:20.593
I'm leaving for the play, Mr.
Moody.
I'll be back at 1:30.

09:20.627 --> 09:22.929
Mr. Moody.

09:23.029 --> 09:28.034
You are making a very
big mistake not letting
Laura off work today.

09:28.034 --> 09:29.803
Oh yeah? Why?

09:29.836 --> 09:32.305
If you let her be
in our show today,

09:32.339 --> 09:36.109
I guarantee you
it'll double your business.

09:36.142 --> 09:37.811
- Double my business?
- Uh-huh.

09:37.844 --> 09:40.380
- How?
- Step into my office.

09:40.413 --> 09:43.383
It's time to play
"Let's Make a Deal."

09:44.217 --> 09:45.652
Zack's going to get me fired!

09:45.685 --> 09:48.588
Zack wouldn't do
anything to hurt you.

09:54.260 --> 09:57.230
Well, there you go!
You're in the show, Laura.

09:57.263 --> 09:59.833
I am?
Zack, you're amazing!

09:59.866 --> 10:01.501
- How in the world...
- Later.

10:01.534 --> 10:04.270
You've got 20 minutes to learn
your part.
Come on! Kelly, come on!

10:04.304 --> 10:07.907
- Go ahead.
I'm gonna get my things.
- Okay, but hurry up.

10:15.348 --> 10:17.350
Marlene, I'm buying
this jacket for Laura.

10:17.384 --> 10:18.718
Can you put it
away until I get back?

10:18.752 --> 10:21.354
And keep it a secret.
Thanks a lot.

10:30.463 --> 10:32.499
Zack, these changes you made

10:32.532 --> 10:34.701
aren't exactly
what Dickens had in mind.

10:34.734 --> 10:37.937
Mom, it was the only way
to get Laura into the play.

10:37.971 --> 10:39.406
Okay.

10:39.439 --> 10:42.208
Hope you're good
at ducking tomatoes.

10:45.945 --> 10:48.748
Good afternoon and welcome
to our performance

10:48.782 --> 10:51.584
of Charles Dickens'
"A Christmas Carol."

10:54.320 --> 10:57.557
Mr.
Dickens, if you're out there,
I'm sorry!

11:07.067 --> 11:11.304
Well, Cratchit, you'll want
tomorrow off, I suppose?

11:11.338 --> 11:13.239
It is Christmas Day, Mr.
Scrooge.

11:13.273 --> 11:15.141
I'd like to spend it
with me family.

11:15.175 --> 11:16.810
( laughs )

11:16.843 --> 11:21.348
Poor excuse for
picking a man's pocket
every 25th of December!

11:21.381 --> 11:22.949
Please, sir.

11:24.250 --> 11:27.087
All right.
Stay home tomorrow.

11:27.120 --> 11:28.588
But be here early
the next morning!

11:28.621 --> 11:30.090
Thank you, Mr. Scrooge!

11:30.090 --> 11:32.959
- Merry Christmas.
- And Cratchit!

11:32.992 --> 11:34.994
About those clothes
you're wearing...

11:35.095 --> 11:36.930
Bah! Humbug!

11:36.963 --> 11:40.667
When you come back,
I want to see you
wearing something with style,

11:40.700 --> 11:43.603
something from
Moody's Store for Men!

11:45.638 --> 11:49.376
Oh, you mean that elegant shop
in the Bayside mall?

11:49.409 --> 11:53.413
That's exactly what I mean!
Open Christmas Eve till 9:00!

12:00.320 --> 12:02.655
Behold, Ebenezer Scrooge,

12:02.689 --> 12:06.826
here is
a family poor in money,
yet rich in Christmas cheer!

12:06.860 --> 12:08.862
Do you know where we are?

12:10.597 --> 12:12.766
Yes,
Ghost of Christmas Present.

12:12.799 --> 12:16.336
We're at the home of my clerk
Bob Cratchit.

12:21.875 --> 12:23.977
When will Father
be home, Mother?

12:24.077 --> 12:27.280
I bet that pig of a boss
is making him work!

12:27.313 --> 12:29.749
- Kids are so rude nowadays!
- Shh!

12:29.783 --> 12:31.418
Watch!

12:31.451 --> 12:34.854
No, your father's at church
with your brother, Tiny Tim.

12:34.888 --> 12:36.956
( laughter )

12:36.990 --> 12:38.925
I think I hear 'em coming!

12:47.901 --> 12:50.103
Merry Christmas, Mummy!

12:50.103 --> 12:51.671
Merry Christmas, sisters!

12:51.705 --> 12:54.174
Women:
Merry Christmas, Tiny Tim!

12:54.207 --> 12:55.842
And Merry Christmas, me girls!

12:55.875 --> 12:57.744
Come, everyone,
sit round the table!

12:57.777 --> 12:59.646
The goose is ready!

12:59.679 --> 13:01.114
Before we eat,

13:01.147 --> 13:04.551
let's raise a glass of eggnog
to the man who pays me wages,

13:04.584 --> 13:07.220
the man who makes
this Christmas
feast possible...

13:07.253 --> 13:08.521
Mr. Scrooge!

13:10.056 --> 13:12.058
Here's our goose!

13:17.497 --> 13:20.500
To Mr. Scrooge,
the old cheapskate.

13:20.533 --> 13:23.970
To Mr. Scrooge.
I hope he chokes
on his chestnuts!

13:27.540 --> 13:31.845
Mummy, Daddy,
sisters dear,

13:31.878 --> 13:34.080
this goose was
cooked with love,

13:34.114 --> 13:37.517
and we're all here together
to share it on Christmas day.

13:37.550 --> 13:40.453
So I say there never was
such a goose.

13:40.487 --> 13:42.989
It's the best goose
ever cooked!

13:44.257 --> 13:46.826
( coughs )

13:46.860 --> 13:50.363
Sorry, I forgot you're
the sickly Tiny Tim.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.833
It's a shame about Tiny Tim.

13:53.867 --> 13:55.702
Yes, it's tragic.

13:55.735 --> 13:59.439
So young, so brave,
and so poorly dressed!

13:59.472 --> 14:03.343
He should try
the boys department
at Moody's Store for Men!

14:03.376 --> 14:06.079
- But Tim is so tiny.
- Humbug!

14:06.112 --> 14:08.181
Moody's Store for Men
has all sizes,

14:08.214 --> 14:10.717
from Tiny Tim
to Gigantic George!

14:10.750 --> 14:13.920
And at bargain prices even
the Cratchits could afford!

14:20.694 --> 14:22.162
Here you go, old Joe!

14:22.195 --> 14:24.397
What price will you
give me for all this?

14:24.431 --> 14:28.835
Mmm... how does a cleaning
woman come to have
these gentlemen's items?

14:28.868 --> 14:32.172
I stole 'em! He who owned them
is lying dead in his bed!

14:32.205 --> 14:35.408
So when I cleaned up,
I really cleaned up!

14:36.543 --> 14:38.978
But people will know
his things are missing.

14:39.079 --> 14:41.548
What people?
No one cared about him!

14:41.581 --> 14:43.083
He was alone in the world.

14:43.083 --> 14:46.152
A penny-pinching,
tight-fisted,
old skinflint he was!

14:46.186 --> 14:47.987
- He was?
- He was!

14:49.723 --> 14:51.491
Spirit of
Christmas Yet to Come,

14:51.524 --> 14:54.627
who is the penny-pinching,
tightfisted old skinflint?

14:54.661 --> 14:56.696
You are thick, honey!

14:58.598 --> 15:00.033
You mean, it's me?

15:00.033 --> 15:02.335
Scrooge,
you better change your act;

15:02.369 --> 15:03.870
you better
change your attitude;

15:03.903 --> 15:06.773
and you better change
that sorry-looking wardrobe.

15:06.806 --> 15:09.342
Nightshirts are
deader than disco.

15:10.944 --> 15:13.880
Spirit, hear me!
I am not the man I was!

15:13.913 --> 15:17.784
I'll honor Christmas
in my heart, and I'll keep it
with me all year long!

15:17.817 --> 15:21.521
I'll be thoughtful,
generous and nice!

15:21.554 --> 15:23.123
All right!

15:23.156 --> 15:26.960
But if you're gonna be good,
you've gotta look good! So...

15:28.061 --> 15:29.763
( crowd gasps )

15:30.930 --> 15:33.667
Wow! I look hot!

15:33.700 --> 15:36.803
- Where are
these clothes from?
- Where else?

15:38.238 --> 15:40.407
For the well-dressed miser,
the only place to shop

15:40.440 --> 15:42.475
is Moody's Store for Men!

15:42.509 --> 15:44.744
All major credit
cards accepted.

15:54.788 --> 15:56.456
Marlene, you can take
your break now.

15:56.489 --> 15:59.192
Kelly will be back as soon
as she takes off her warts!

15:59.225 --> 16:01.761
- Thanks, Laura.
- Marlene?

16:01.795 --> 16:03.630
What happened
to that sports coat?

16:03.663 --> 16:06.366
Oh, somebody bought it.

16:06.399 --> 16:08.468
I'll see you later.

16:11.471 --> 16:14.441
What are you doing?
Where's that jacket?

16:14.474 --> 16:16.810
Marlene sold it, Mr. Moody.

16:23.183 --> 16:26.052
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.
There's no receipt.

16:26.052 --> 16:28.822
You stole it!
I'm calling security!

16:28.855 --> 16:30.657
Wait!
I didn't steal anything!

16:30.690 --> 16:33.760
- Tell it to the cops.
- Cops?

16:35.695 --> 16:37.864
Hello, security.
This is Melvin Moody,

16:37.897 --> 16:40.667
and I'm in a bad moody...
I mean, mood!

16:41.601 --> 16:43.603
Hey, Mr. Moody!
Nice show, huh?

16:43.636 --> 16:45.372
Where's Laura?
I bought her a rose.

16:45.405 --> 16:48.174
She's a thief! She stole
a sports coat and ran away!

16:48.208 --> 16:51.911
What? I had Marlene
put that coat aside for me!

16:51.945 --> 16:54.114
I was going
to pay for it right now!

16:55.415 --> 16:57.517
I've got to find Laura.

17:00.453 --> 17:02.122
Forget it.

17:08.895 --> 17:11.263
- How did you guys do?
- Nothing. What about you?

17:11.297 --> 17:12.699
We have looked everywhere.

17:12.732 --> 17:14.534
There is no sign of
her or her father.

17:14.567 --> 17:16.336
Come on,
we've got to find Laura!

17:16.368 --> 17:18.171
We will, Zack.

17:18.204 --> 17:21.273
Zack, I hung
outside the ladies' room,
waiting for Laura to come out.

17:21.307 --> 17:22.709
What happened?

17:22.742 --> 17:26.146
Three women slapped me,
and one proposed marriage.

17:27.380 --> 17:28.948
It's all my fault.

17:29.049 --> 17:31.584
I never should have told
Mr. Moody Laura was homeless.

17:31.618 --> 17:33.720
- I made him suspicious.
- No, blame Moody!

17:33.753 --> 17:36.189
He thought Laura's a thief
just because she's homeless.

17:36.222 --> 17:39.659
Yeah, and after that free
publicity we gave him...

17:39.693 --> 17:43.196
A woman saw Laura run
into the parking lot then
head away from the mall.

17:43.229 --> 17:45.265
I looked all around,
but I couldn't find her.

17:45.298 --> 17:48.234
- We've got to
comb the neighborhood.
- We'll split up.

17:48.268 --> 17:51.338
- Zack,
you and I can go in my car.
- Lisa, you can go with me.

17:51.371 --> 17:54.974
- Screech,
you don't have a car!
- I have a bus pass.

17:56.776 --> 17:58.511
Let's all meet back
at our house at 8:00

17:58.545 --> 18:00.914
and hope we're celebrating
finding Laura.

18:01.014 --> 18:02.716
Good luck, guys.

18:08.054 --> 18:09.889
All right. Yeah.

18:10.890 --> 18:12.726
Bye, Jessie.

18:12.759 --> 18:16.029
She's talked to everybody.
No one could find her.
What's...

18:16.029 --> 18:19.432
We did the best we could,
and we can try again tomorrow.

18:19.466 --> 18:21.034
We'd better pick
out a tree now.

18:21.034 --> 18:22.836
Your father will be
home in a few hours.

18:22.869 --> 18:25.071
Why don't you
do it without me?
I'm really not in the mood.

18:25.105 --> 18:28.742
Come on, Zack, it's time
to get on with Christmas.

18:28.775 --> 18:30.577
( sighs ) Okay.

18:37.083 --> 18:39.686
Excuse me?
Would you mind
not parking here?

18:39.719 --> 18:42.255
We need this space
for people picking up trees.

18:42.288 --> 18:43.890
Thanks.

18:43.923 --> 18:46.159
( engine stalls )

18:50.063 --> 18:52.532
Darn wire's loose again.

18:52.565 --> 18:54.134
Oh boy.

19:00.273 --> 19:02.008
- Hey, Mr. Benton!
- Hello, Zack.

19:02.008 --> 19:04.377
- Where's Laura?
- I'm right here, Zack.

19:04.411 --> 19:06.012
We've been looking
all over for you!

19:06.012 --> 19:08.415
You've got to believe me.
I didn't steal anything!

19:08.448 --> 19:10.684
Of course we believe you.

19:10.717 --> 19:12.285
Kelly had that
jacket put away.

19:12.318 --> 19:13.887
She was going to
buy it for you.

19:13.920 --> 19:17.157
Sounds like you've made
some good friends, Laura.

19:17.190 --> 19:19.459
Where are you guys staying?
We've looked everywhere.

19:19.492 --> 19:21.728
This is where we're staying.

19:21.761 --> 19:24.531
You mean...
living in your car?

19:24.564 --> 19:28.034
We like to think of it
as a mobile home.

19:30.303 --> 19:33.940
Well, this is no place
to spend Christmas Eve.

19:39.079 --> 19:42.749
- Hey, this tree is ready!
- Zack, flip the switch!

19:49.255 --> 19:53.326
Come on,
you guys, help yourselves
to cookies and eggnog!

19:54.127 --> 19:55.895
( doorbell rings )

19:59.466 --> 20:01.434
- Hey, Kelly, come on in!
- Hi!

20:01.468 --> 20:05.071
Sorry I'm late. Mr. Moody
made me stay
after closing time!

20:05.105 --> 20:06.740
What a Scrooge!

20:06.773 --> 20:10.410
After all we went through,
he still wouldn't let me
buy that sports jacket.

20:10.443 --> 20:12.345
It doesn't surprise me.

20:12.379 --> 20:15.915
That's because he wanted
to give it to you himself!

20:18.852 --> 20:21.321
I'm sorry I
misjudged you, Laura.

20:21.354 --> 20:23.089
Merry Christmas.

20:25.258 --> 20:27.894
Hey, Moody,
nice wrapping job!

20:29.396 --> 20:31.431
Thank you, Mr. Moody.

20:31.464 --> 20:33.767
See you Thursday
for the holiday sale.

20:33.800 --> 20:36.503
Merry Christmas, Mr. Moody.

20:36.536 --> 20:38.204
( groans )

20:39.372 --> 20:41.508
Open it, Dad. Open it!

20:42.142 --> 20:44.411
My goodness.

20:44.444 --> 20:46.312
Oh, it's beautiful.

20:46.346 --> 20:47.981
Try it on!

20:50.684 --> 20:52.352
Got it?

20:52.385 --> 20:55.055
Hey, perfect fit!

20:55.088 --> 20:58.692
This has just turned
into a wonderful Christmas.

20:58.725 --> 21:01.628
Well, Christmas
isn't over yet, Frank.

21:02.629 --> 21:04.464
See, I talked to my dad
on the phone,

21:04.497 --> 21:08.301
and he wants you to stay here
until you get a job and
get back on your feet.

21:08.335 --> 21:10.437
- I don't know what to say.
- Say yes!

21:10.470 --> 21:11.971
I'd love to
have new neighbors!

21:12.072 --> 21:14.074
It might take
a while finding a job.

21:14.074 --> 21:16.309
- We could wear
out our welcome.
- Don't worry.

21:16.343 --> 21:19.713
Zack wore out his welcome
a long time ago.

21:19.746 --> 21:23.550
- Mom.
- And he's still here.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.652
You've made us an offer
we can't refuse.

21:25.685 --> 21:28.688
- Great!
- All right!

21:28.722 --> 21:31.591
Zack, I don't know
how to thank you.

21:31.624 --> 21:34.094
Well, a kiss would be nice.

21:34.994 --> 21:36.896
There you go.

21:39.232 --> 21:40.834
You've all been so terrific.

21:40.867 --> 21:43.403
I wish we had something
to give to you.

21:43.436 --> 21:45.772
There is one thing, dear.

21:53.546 --> 21:56.349
( playing "Silent Night"
on the piano )

22:01.254 --> 22:05.058
<i>* Silent night</i>

22:05.091 --> 22:08.795
<i>* Holy night</i>

22:08.828 --> 22:12.632
<i>* All is calm</i>

22:12.665 --> 22:16.369
<i>* All is bright</i>

22:16.403 --> 22:20.240
<i>* Round yon virgin</i>

22:20.273 --> 22:23.977

22:24.077 --> 22:29.816

22:31.718 --> 22:37.424
<i>* Sleep in heavenly peace</i>

22:39.526 --> 22:44.664
<i>* Sleep in heavenly peace *</i>

22:48.568 --> 22:50.837
All: Merry Christmas!

22:57.744 --> 22:59.679

theme music plays )
