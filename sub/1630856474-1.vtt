WEBVTT

06:25.899 --> 06:26.902
Yes?

06:27.004 --> 06:28.900
Please inform
Signor Ferrari

06:29.002 --> 06:32.905
<i>that the Maserati driver
Jean Behra has just arrived
from Milan.</i>

06:33.007 --> 06:34.374
Hmm. Thank you.

06:34.477 --> 06:37.610
Thank you, most excellent
and gracious signora.

07:03.343 --> 07:04.170
Yes?

07:04.273 --> 07:06.644
<i>Laura. It's Chiti. Is he there?</i>

07:06.746 --> 07:08.211
He's taking a shower.

07:08.313 --> 07:11.845
Give him a message, please.
Jean Behra is in town.

07:20.659 --> 07:21.720
How are you?

07:44.980 --> 07:46.382
Signor Ferrari?

07:46.982 --> 07:48.384
Signor Ferrari!

07:49.051 --> 07:50.314
May I present myself?

07:50.416 --> 07:52.487
I am Alfonso de Portago.

08:06.200 --> 08:08.333
Wow.

08:20.147 --> 08:21.912
It's Ferrari.

08:23.617 --> 08:27.120
Good morning, Enzo!
Your friends are back.

08:27.222 --> 08:29.621
This time, I hope in tune.

08:29.724 --> 08:32.494
More in tune
than your cars in Monaco
last week.

08:33.293 --> 08:35.761
Enzo! We have to talk.

08:36.767 --> 08:38.130
That bad?

08:38.232 --> 08:39.831
I will come by later.

09:11.902 --> 09:12.869
Yes.

09:12.971 --> 09:14.270
<i>Behra is here.</i>

09:14.373 --> 09:16.003
<i>The Orsi brothers
collected him at the station.</i>

09:16.105 --> 09:17.739
<i>Did signora tell you?</i>

09:17.842 --> 09:19.010
<i>The word is</i>

09:19.112 --> 09:20.909
he's going to challenge
our record.

09:21.011 --> 09:22.278
Is the 801 ready?

09:22.381 --> 09:24.881
After the Workers Mass at 9:00.
After that.

09:24.983 --> 09:27.013
I'll call Castellotti.

09:27.115 --> 09:28.049
Behra's here.

09:28.151 --> 09:29.717
Really?

09:29.819 --> 09:32.485
So many phone calls,
I thought Frank Sinatra
came to town.

09:32.587 --> 09:34.884
Hotel Medici, Firenze.
What do I tell them?

09:34.986 --> 09:37.127
"Excuse me, please,
my husband isn't here.

09:37.229 --> 09:40.129
He's out whoring.
<i>Grazie, buongiorno."</i>

09:40.231 --> 09:42.166
Signor Castellotti, please.
Enzo.

09:42.269 --> 09:45.666
I don't give a fuck
who you screw or how many.

09:46.700 --> 09:48.635
But the rule is
that you have to be here

09:48.737 --> 09:50.803
before the maid arrives
with the morning coffee.

09:50.905 --> 09:53.373
- That was the agreement,
was it not?
- Laura, please.

09:53.475 --> 09:55.746
<i>Buongiorno, signora,
Commendatore.</i>

10:02.721 --> 10:03.579
<i>Pronto.</i>

10:03.681 --> 10:05.315
<i>Eugenio, my boy.</i>

10:05.417 --> 10:06.686
<i>Commendatore.</i>

10:06.788 --> 10:09.889
<i>Can you be at
the Modena Autodrome by 11:00?</i>

10:10.325 --> 10:11.692
Bring your lucky gloves.

10:12.292 --> 10:13.392
What gloves?

10:13.494 --> 10:14.726
<i>The gloves that will beat Behra,</i>

10:14.828 --> 10:17.027
<i>who's come to steal
from you our record.</i>

10:18.497 --> 10:19.698
I'll be there.

10:19.800 --> 10:21.266
Good.
Will that be all, signora?

10:21.368 --> 10:23.070
That'll be all.

10:23.172 --> 10:25.070
Laura, the car broke.

10:31.346 --> 10:33.045
What's going on in there?

10:33.147 --> 10:37.619
Her gentleness, the signora,
is trying to shoot
the <i>Commendatore.</i>

10:39.753 --> 10:42.688
<i>Buongiorno,</i> Peppino.
I let him live.

10:42.790 --> 10:45.162
That gun was given to you
for your protection.

10:45.264 --> 10:47.530
And talk to Cuoghi.
You're going broke.

10:49.530 --> 10:51.332
I knew it would come to this.

10:51.434 --> 10:53.066
You gave her a gun,
she'll use it.

10:53.168 --> 10:56.506
She carries
the payroll for the factory
around in that handbag.

10:56.608 --> 10:59.873
I'd rearm Germany
before I gave that woman a gun.

10:59.975 --> 11:03.311
Peppino will take you
and Laura to the cemetery
this morning.

11:03.413 --> 11:04.843
And don't forget
the Workers Mass

11:04.945 --> 11:07.115
unless you want
to pay higher wages next year.

11:07.217 --> 11:08.651
Don't fight with Laura.

11:08.753 --> 11:10.017
Mm.

11:10.820 --> 11:14.019
Good morning.
No one was hurt,
so don't make a fuss.

11:14.121 --> 11:15.089
What?

11:15.191 --> 11:16.826
What have I said?

11:49.160 --> 11:50.692
Morning, <i>Commendatore.</i>

11:51.127 --> 11:52.430
Good morning.

11:58.866 --> 12:01.098
Did you know
who was in the car?

12:01.633 --> 12:03.366
It was Jean Behra.

12:03.469 --> 12:06.103
Don't panic, Matteo.
If they take the record,
we shall take it back.

12:07.478 --> 12:09.777
How did our football team
do yesterday?

12:11.117 --> 12:13.416
You know damn well.
We lost.

12:13.518 --> 12:16.350
Oh, one long catalog
of disaster it's been.

12:16.452 --> 12:18.016
How long
since you took over?

12:18.584 --> 12:19.917
What about Le Mans?

12:20.019 --> 12:22.259
Jaguar one, two and three.
What's that?

12:22.361 --> 12:27.060
Well, from my mistakes I learn,
whereas the mistakes you make
you repeat, week after week.

12:27.696 --> 12:29.794
When you play Bologna,
I hope you win.

12:29.896 --> 12:31.733
Otherwise I have to
relocate the factory

12:31.835 --> 12:35.069
so the drivers
are not dispirited
by living in a city

12:35.171 --> 12:39.674
whose football team dwells
in the perpetual twilight
of failure.

12:39.776 --> 12:42.143
The Modena Football Club
is the pride of Emilia.

13:22.582 --> 13:24.082
Cuoghi wants to meet.

13:27.356 --> 13:29.120
That means bad news.

13:37.699 --> 13:39.867
Now, your mother missed
on purpose.

13:42.269 --> 13:45.169
One day she won't,
and then I'll be in here
with you.

13:54.750 --> 13:57.082
I'm hearing voices
in my sleep again.

13:59.189 --> 14:00.690
My brother.

14:01.488 --> 14:02.956
And my father.

14:05.164 --> 14:07.092
No, I see their faces too.

14:09.331 --> 14:10.931
But also now,

14:11.665 --> 14:13.866
Campari and Borzacchini,

14:13.968 --> 14:16.239
my two good friends
who died on the same day

14:16.341 --> 14:19.406
24 years ago this week
at Monza

14:19.508 --> 14:21.271
on that evil afternoon.

14:25.852 --> 14:27.145
Ghosts.

14:32.458 --> 14:34.724
There was a time
I loved your mother...

14:36.490 --> 14:37.892
beyond reason.

14:41.534 --> 14:43.766
Well, she was
a different creature then.

14:45.037 --> 14:46.769
But so was I.

14:49.373 --> 14:51.070
And I see you too, you know.

14:55.644 --> 14:58.583
Every moment I close my eyes.

15:24.903 --> 15:26.974
Your face I want to see.

15:34.887 --> 15:36.181
Okay.

15:37.089 --> 15:38.689
Okay.

15:39.357 --> 15:41.087
I go to deal with today.

16:15.025 --> 16:19.092
Did I tell you
of my son Alfredo,
Enzo's older brother?

16:19.759 --> 16:21.292
Many times, signora.

16:21.726 --> 16:22.694
A tragedy.

16:22.796 --> 16:25.197
I lost him in the Great War.

16:26.105 --> 16:27.265
Yes, signora.

16:27.865 --> 16:29.304
Let me tell you,

16:29.406 --> 16:31.038
the wrong son died.

18:03.635 --> 18:05.798
If Jesus had lived today

18:05.901 --> 18:08.772
and not two thousand years ago,

18:08.874 --> 18:11.941
he would have been born
in a small town like Modena.

18:12.809 --> 18:16.107
He would have been
not a carpenter

18:16.209 --> 18:19.179
but a craftsman in metal
like yourselves.

18:20.152 --> 18:21.919
So a God,

18:22.021 --> 18:26.219
who understood,
as a carpenter,
the perfection of the adze,

18:26.321 --> 18:30.722
appreciates, as an engineer,
the precision of your lathe.

18:30.824 --> 18:33.023
The nature of metal.

18:33.125 --> 18:36.260
How it can be forged,
shaped

18:36.362 --> 18:39.998
and hammered by your skills
into an engine,

18:40.100 --> 18:43.968
holding inside a fire
to make power

18:44.070 --> 18:46.503
to speed us through the world.

18:48.373 --> 18:51.379
Which is why we give thanks
to him today.

18:55.683 --> 18:56.986
Are you okay?

21:01.141 --> 21:03.038
May God be with you.

21:03.140 --> 21:05.079
Now go in peace.

21:05.181 --> 21:09.783
<i>In nomine Patris,
Filii et Spiritus Sancti.</i>

21:09.885 --> 21:11.488
Amen.
Amen.

21:11.590 --> 21:14.156
Very good. Okay. Great.

21:20.397 --> 21:21.460
Great.

21:23.435 --> 21:24.994
Great, great.

21:25.096 --> 21:26.399
Very, very good.

21:27.537 --> 21:28.701
1:32.7.

21:28.803 --> 21:30.570
I had 1:32.9.

21:31.206 --> 21:32.805
Signor Ferrari, a Maserati--

21:32.907 --> 21:34.005
Only for the moment.

21:34.107 --> 21:35.443
When do we take it back?

21:35.545 --> 21:36.742
Right now.

21:43.255 --> 21:44.285
Okay!

21:54.967 --> 21:57.229
Glad you could make it,
Eugenio.

21:57.331 --> 22:00.636
Okay, take it easy
till the tires warm up,

22:00.738 --> 22:02.167
then put your foot down.

22:02.269 --> 22:05.174
She'll do 1:30
if given a chance.

22:06.173 --> 22:08.177
Look after Cecilia, will you?

22:36.968 --> 22:39.576
Two laps, and the tires
will be warm.

22:39.678 --> 22:40.674
That's good.

22:40.776 --> 22:42.409
Cecilia Manzini?

22:46.178 --> 22:47.711
I knew your mother.

23:11.906 --> 23:13.836
One minute 34.

23:15.547 --> 23:17.213
He's slow.

23:25.755 --> 23:27.652
Signor Ferrari?

23:28.220 --> 23:30.259
Alfonso de Portago.

23:34.162 --> 23:36.197
We met on the Largo Garibaldi.

23:36.299 --> 23:38.494
Yes, sir. I was seeking
to introduce myself.

23:38.596 --> 23:40.797
Yeah, but the light,
it turned green.

23:51.781 --> 23:54.779
You bought one
of my cars last year
and won the Tour de France.

23:54.881 --> 23:56.017
Yes.

23:56.119 --> 23:57.316
Now I'm looking
for a works drive.

23:57.418 --> 23:59.882
I don't need another driver,
Portago.

24:56.913 --> 24:58.446
De Portago.

25:00.346 --> 25:02.417
Call my office on Monday.

25:12.589 --> 25:15.199
I woke you.
No, I was up.

25:15.899 --> 25:17.632
Did I wake the boy?

25:17.734 --> 25:18.763
Let me.

25:37.922 --> 25:39.487
You haven't said a word.

25:40.352 --> 25:42.323
What is there to say?

25:42.425 --> 25:45.229
The newspapers, the radio,
they have it all.

25:45.894 --> 25:46.923
They do?

25:49.300 --> 25:51.730
Was he your friend,
the young Castellotti?

25:53.801 --> 25:56.834
Or was it your fault?
The car's fault? His fault?

25:59.344 --> 26:01.971
Will you miss him?
Does that bring the boy back?

26:03.809 --> 26:06.712
Why do you push like that?
Why do you think?

26:08.084 --> 26:09.781
I know it matters to you.

26:11.086 --> 26:13.351
To me? Come on.

26:13.454 --> 26:15.754
Twenty-four years ago
this week,

26:16.421 --> 26:18.328
I lost two friends.

26:18.963 --> 26:20.693
Campari and Borzacchini.

26:21.527 --> 26:24.268
At Monza,
in the metal I made.

26:27.499 --> 26:29.739
So I knew then it was,

26:29.841 --> 26:31.935
"Enzo, build a wall."

26:34.843 --> 26:36.441
Or?

26:36.543 --> 26:38.744
Or, "Enzo,
go do something else."

26:54.533 --> 26:58.935
"Ferrari
is an industrial Saturn
devouring his own children.

26:59.038 --> 27:02.502
First Tornaco,
now Castellotti."

27:02.605 --> 27:05.441
If you continue
killing the nation's heroes,

27:05.543 --> 27:08.575
we'll have to
go to America
and live among foreigners.

27:08.677 --> 27:11.648
I did not kill Castellotti.
The papers blame you.

27:11.750 --> 27:12.949
It wasn't me.

27:13.051 --> 27:14.978
If anyone,
it was his mother.

27:15.985 --> 27:17.086
It's true.

27:17.188 --> 27:19.752
He was engaged
to Cecilia Manzini.

27:19.854 --> 27:23.018
His mother wanted him
to marry a woman
with more class.

27:23.120 --> 27:26.323
As a result of the weight
she put on his shoulders,

27:26.425 --> 27:27.759
he became distracted,

27:27.861 --> 27:31.328
he lost his concentration,
he crashed and died.

27:31.430 --> 27:33.130
He blames the mother!

27:33.232 --> 27:36.201
What I'm saying is,
when a mother interferes
in this business,

27:36.303 --> 27:38.034
death usually follows.

27:43.914 --> 27:45.311
Call the bank.

27:45.413 --> 27:47.615
Cancel Castellotti's salary.

27:50.052 --> 27:51.551
And call Chiti.

27:51.654 --> 27:55.117
I need a report on the car
for the insurers.

27:59.094 --> 28:00.496
Yes, signora.

28:17.608 --> 28:19.383
There's Ferrari.

28:24.550 --> 28:26.055
Why is the damn top down?

28:26.157 --> 28:27.454
I didn't want
to get it wet.

28:27.556 --> 28:29.526
It belongs to King Hussein.
Get it inside.

28:29.628 --> 28:31.722
And make sure the cockpit's dry
before you hand it over.

28:31.824 --> 28:33.859
Yes, sir, <i>Commendatore.</i>

28:42.234 --> 28:45.138
Stall the king and tell them
to get a move on in the shop.

28:45.240 --> 28:46.476
Yes, <i>Commendatore.</i>

28:49.076 --> 28:50.279
So?

28:50.381 --> 28:52.209
You're going broke.
Laura's right.

28:52.311 --> 28:53.943
How?
How?

28:54.045 --> 28:56.252
You spend more than you make,
that's how.

28:56.354 --> 28:58.783
The production cars
pay for the racing.

28:58.886 --> 29:01.986
I could run Portugal
on what you spend on racing.

29:03.154 --> 29:05.894
How many production cars
did you make last year?

29:05.996 --> 29:08.931
Uh, 140, 150.

29:09.033 --> 29:11.461
Ninety-eight.
198.

29:11.563 --> 29:14.097
No. Ninety-eight.

29:15.907 --> 29:17.136
So what do I do?

29:17.238 --> 29:18.607
Find a partner.

29:18.709 --> 29:22.174
I have a partner. My wife.
She is very mean with money.

29:22.276 --> 29:23.542
A real partner.

29:23.644 --> 29:26.149
Like Agnelli at Fiat
or Henry Ford.

29:26.251 --> 29:27.614
Someone who has capital
to pump in.

29:27.717 --> 29:30.184
No. Impossible.
With money,
they want control.

29:30.286 --> 29:31.686
I must have total control.

29:31.788 --> 29:34.422
The right partner would help
with the production cars,

29:34.524 --> 29:37.021
while you do what you like
with the racing.

29:38.728 --> 29:42.491
Increase production
to 400 customer cars a year.

29:42.593 --> 29:44.094
Attract finance.

29:45.466 --> 29:47.199
Then you can negotiate.

29:47.301 --> 29:51.066
How do we make--
never mind how do we sell--
400 customer cars a year?

29:51.168 --> 29:53.802
Jaguar took the first
three places at Le Mans.

29:53.905 --> 29:56.477
Now their sales books
are full.

29:56.579 --> 29:59.713
You win on Sunday,
you sell on Monday.

29:59.815 --> 30:02.514
You already have kings
waiting in line.
Mm, Jaguar.

30:02.616 --> 30:05.550
Jaguar races
only to sell cars.

30:05.652 --> 30:07.455
I sell cars
only to be racing.

30:07.557 --> 30:09.422
We are completely
different organisms.

30:09.525 --> 30:12.094
Survive,
or you are no organism.

30:12.196 --> 30:14.025
Hello.

30:16.761 --> 30:19.028
I am Alfonso de Portago.

30:19.130 --> 30:21.703
I have an appointment
with Signor Ferrari.

30:24.438 --> 30:26.004
Take a seat, please.

30:34.450 --> 30:36.514
Win the Mille Miglia, Enzo.

30:36.616 --> 30:38.318
Attract outside finance.

30:38.420 --> 30:40.150
Or you are
out of business.

30:51.197 --> 30:53.302
Signor Ferrari,
this is Don Alfonso--

30:53.404 --> 30:55.401
Yeah, I know who it is.
Cuoghi!

30:55.503 --> 30:57.134
The Marquis de Portago!

31:02.508 --> 31:03.778
Hey, Ferrari!

31:04.476 --> 31:05.714
Cuoghi!

31:11.220 --> 31:12.689
One more thing.

31:12.791 --> 31:15.317
How did Laura get her hands
on the freehold to the plant?

31:16.493 --> 31:18.253
The Nazis were
about to arrest me.

31:18.355 --> 31:21.030
I put it in her name
along with half the shares.

31:21.132 --> 31:22.731
We built it together.

31:23.232 --> 31:24.366
Get it back.

31:24.468 --> 31:26.235
If you face up
to Agnelli or Ford,

31:26.338 --> 31:27.897
you have to hold
all the cards.

31:27.999 --> 31:29.940
Well, it's easier said
than done.

31:30.042 --> 31:30.937
Ferrari!

31:31.403 --> 31:32.436
Ah.

31:32.538 --> 31:33.602
Your Majesty!

31:33.704 --> 31:34.938
One more thing.

31:35.040 --> 31:37.213
If I'm in bad shape,
what of Maserati?

31:37.315 --> 31:39.548
Worse.
I give them six months.

31:39.650 --> 31:41.311
They've gone to the French
for finance.

31:41.413 --> 31:44.918
And they, too,
will try to prove themselves
at the Mille Miglia.

31:45.020 --> 31:48.823
Everyone's eye will be on it.
Only one team will win.

31:49.820 --> 31:51.826
Make sure it's you.

31:55.862 --> 31:58.096
- Your Highness!
- Which Highness?

31:59.669 --> 32:02.336
That Highness.
You, get out to the track.

32:02.438 --> 32:04.069
Your Majesty, come this way.

32:07.908 --> 32:10.208
I hope you got
my measurements right.

32:10.310 --> 32:14.211
Last time my feet could
barely touch the pedals.
Of course.

32:52.883 --> 32:54.922
He drives like Varzi.

33:54.282 --> 33:55.477
Well,

33:56.418 --> 33:57.721
how did I do?

33:58.523 --> 34:00.449
You drive like Varzi.

34:01.826 --> 34:04.454
Your duties will include
testing and road racing.

34:04.556 --> 34:07.263
The Mille Miglia?
You'll drive a works 250.

34:07.365 --> 34:08.962
Not the most powerful car,

34:09.064 --> 34:11.095
but reliable
and it goes like hell
round corners,

34:11.197 --> 34:13.363
so I'll expect you
to be in the points.

34:14.337 --> 34:15.864
Actresses.

34:16.700 --> 34:19.205
I have admiration,
but keep them away
from the paddock.

34:19.307 --> 34:22.737
They distract photographers,
whose attention I want
on my cars.

34:22.840 --> 34:24.342
Understand?

34:24.444 --> 34:26.013
Okay.

34:39.461 --> 34:40.427
Peter.

34:42.031 --> 34:44.363
Look after our new driver.
He's wet and hungry.

34:44.466 --> 34:45.929
Hello, Fon.

34:46.031 --> 34:47.765
How do you do?
Pa. Papa, Papa!

34:47.867 --> 34:49.032
What are you doing here?

34:49.134 --> 34:51.438
Get the autograph.
Whose, Collins?

34:51.540 --> 34:53.337
No, de Portago's.

34:53.837 --> 34:55.339
All right.

35:01.651 --> 35:03.182
I could eat a horse.

35:06.656 --> 35:08.856
Stop pretending
you can count.

35:08.959 --> 35:12.191
Good to see you.
How are you?
How's your son?

35:12.756 --> 35:13.893
Fon.

35:13.995 --> 35:15.858
Mike Hawthorn,
future world champion.

35:15.960 --> 35:17.495
The famous von Trips.

35:17.597 --> 35:21.230
Olivier Gendebien,
the best sports car driver
in the world.

35:21.332 --> 35:24.436
Taruffi, the oldest.
Truly the best.

35:24.538 --> 35:28.804
Chiti, the best engineer,
but always, always anxious.

35:28.906 --> 35:30.474
And Scaglietti.

35:30.576 --> 35:34.476
Working on a project so secret
we are not allowed to discuss.

35:34.578 --> 35:36.846
<i>Arrivederci,</i> Maserati.

35:36.948 --> 35:39.553
So, de Portago, what brings you
to this neck of the woods

35:39.655 --> 35:43.492
when everyone knows
the future of chassis technology
with rear engines is in England?

35:43.594 --> 35:44.855
Rear engines?
Yes.

35:44.957 --> 35:46.323
The ox must pull the cart.

35:46.425 --> 35:49.327
What we need is more power.
You hear that, Chiti?

35:49.928 --> 35:51.797
But they turn quick.

35:51.900 --> 35:53.364
And have
no straight-line speed.

35:53.466 --> 35:55.900
And the English,
they have a new invention
called brakes,

35:56.002 --> 35:57.973
unlike my 250.

35:58.940 --> 36:00.539
All right. To de Portago.

36:00.641 --> 36:02.505
Cheers.

36:04.278 --> 36:06.982
To de Portago's hair.

36:07.913 --> 36:09.413
Don't you think?

36:18.690 --> 36:20.261
Fon!

36:20.797 --> 36:22.759
Are you running around
like that?

36:22.861 --> 36:24.397
Oh!

37:16.454 --> 37:18.020
What's so funny?

37:18.618 --> 37:19.923
Uh...

37:20.857 --> 37:22.989
I wondered
when you'd be back.

37:23.091 --> 37:26.228
How can I stay away?
It's the plums.

37:31.732 --> 37:33.161
Where's Piero?

37:33.263 --> 37:34.696
On his way home from school.

37:36.069 --> 37:38.839
He asked me yesterday.
What?

37:38.941 --> 37:42.044
"Am I Piero Lardi
or Piero Ferrari?"

38:00.365 --> 38:01.561
Papa!

38:01.663 --> 38:02.999
Have you got it?

38:03.897 --> 38:05.731
The autograph. No.

38:05.833 --> 38:07.867
Oh.
He hasn't, uh,

38:07.969 --> 38:10.306
had a proper picture
taken yet.

38:10.408 --> 38:11.507
What autograph?

38:11.609 --> 38:13.037
De Portago.
From Spain.

38:13.139 --> 38:15.011
He's going
to drive for me.

38:16.578 --> 38:17.706
Great.

38:22.686 --> 38:24.486
Why do you like him so much?

38:24.588 --> 38:25.953
He drives like Varzi.

38:26.055 --> 38:28.686
I'm going
to be a driver.
Like you.

38:29.355 --> 38:32.153
No, not like me.
I only won a few races.

38:32.255 --> 38:33.997
This is much better.

38:34.925 --> 38:36.461
Why?

38:39.369 --> 38:40.630
Okay.

38:41.564 --> 38:43.600
Pretend you're inside
this engine.

38:45.170 --> 38:47.208
In the intake manifold.

38:48.206 --> 38:50.346
Right here. Really pretend.

38:50.448 --> 38:51.608
You're tiny.

38:52.309 --> 38:53.843
The size of a little ant.

38:53.946 --> 38:55.414
Now look up.

38:56.883 --> 38:58.153
It's silver.

38:59.149 --> 39:00.521
What do you see?

39:00.623 --> 39:02.084
A big tunnel.

39:02.186 --> 39:04.259
Like a pipe, yes?

39:04.829 --> 39:07.963
Now pretend
water races through.

39:08.066 --> 39:10.660
And when it hits this side,
what does it do?

39:11.768 --> 39:13.197
Some will splash sideways.

39:13.299 --> 39:18.107
But if I make the curve
more gentle,

39:18.971 --> 39:20.871
more slippery,

39:20.973 --> 39:22.408
what does it do?

39:23.207 --> 39:24.773
It will go faster.

39:27.547 --> 39:30.550
Fuel and air will move faster
just like the water.

39:31.086 --> 39:33.056
And that is all an engine does.

39:33.491 --> 39:35.120
Moves fuel in,

39:35.222 --> 39:37.022
sparks them
into rapid expansion,

39:37.125 --> 39:40.129
moves old gases out,
new fuel in.

39:40.231 --> 39:43.066
And the faster it can do that,
the more power you make.

39:49.540 --> 39:51.272
It looks better.

39:52.740 --> 39:54.077
Does it?

39:56.979 --> 39:58.675
I have a secret
to tell you.

39:59.682 --> 40:00.748
In all life,

40:00.850 --> 40:02.610
when a thing works better,

40:02.712 --> 40:05.046
usually it is more beautiful
to the eye.

40:07.252 --> 40:09.158
Piero, go wash up.

40:13.463 --> 40:14.526
Mmm.

40:17.229 --> 40:19.262
Are you staying to eat?

40:19.364 --> 40:21.032
I'll sit with you and Piero.

40:21.134 --> 40:22.367
Will you come back after?

40:22.469 --> 40:25.400
It depends. I'll try.
Mm, depends on what?

40:25.502 --> 40:27.704
On how business with her goes.

40:32.209 --> 40:33.743
I'm too easy.

40:34.916 --> 40:36.383
What do you mean?

40:36.950 --> 40:38.587
Too modern.

40:39.390 --> 40:41.921
I should give you lots of shit
like a normal Italian woman.

40:42.023 --> 40:43.317
I prefer you like you are.

40:43.419 --> 40:45.128
Oh, I'm sure you do.

40:46.997 --> 40:49.632
What I should become
is the mistress.

40:49.734 --> 40:52.132
"Oh, Enzo!
I feel so sad.

40:52.234 --> 40:55.501
Buy me a fur coat
and a diamond necklace."

40:56.099 --> 40:57.503
Piero!

40:58.168 --> 40:59.604
Sit down.

41:03.478 --> 41:06.780
Don't worry.
I do not plan
to change who I am.

41:06.882 --> 41:08.613
Thank you.
Thank you?

41:10.555 --> 41:11.748
For nothing.

41:13.251 --> 41:14.885
It's not for you.

41:15.655 --> 41:18.557
Do you know
the hardest part
of my life with you?

41:19.258 --> 41:21.597
There is none.
There is.

41:21.699 --> 41:23.298
What?
Being away.

41:24.497 --> 41:26.898
While with me--
what do the English say?

41:27.000 --> 41:28.535
A piece of pie?

41:29.104 --> 41:30.899
Cake, Enzo.
And you're not.

41:52.962 --> 41:54.461
Thank you, Alda.

41:57.196 --> 41:59.467
Those are from Cuoghi.

41:59.569 --> 42:02.999
He says our days are numbered
unless we find a new partner.

42:03.668 --> 42:06.034
One of the big companies.
Fiat or Ford.

42:06.136 --> 42:07.472
No.

42:07.574 --> 42:09.609
You've never had a boss.
You won't like it.

42:09.711 --> 42:12.642
In order
to attract this partner,
he says we have to expand.

42:12.745 --> 42:15.048
He's talking about
building 400 cars a year.

42:15.151 --> 42:17.553
How do we sell 400 cars a year?

42:17.655 --> 42:20.984
We have to win the Mille Miglia,
then orders for sports cars
will follow.

42:21.086 --> 42:25.086
This man knows contract law.
What does he know
about motor racing?

42:25.188 --> 42:26.625
Hmm?

42:26.727 --> 42:29.698
A thousand miles
across bad roads
with sheep and dogs.

42:29.800 --> 42:30.827
Anything can happen.

42:32.966 --> 42:34.303
What else?

42:34.902 --> 42:35.964
What else?

42:39.337 --> 42:43.338
You should assign me control
of your stock in the company
and the freehold,

42:43.440 --> 42:44.908
uh, so I can deal.

42:45.010 --> 42:46.346
Oh.

42:46.448 --> 42:48.878
Because Henry Ford
won't deal with a woman.

42:50.686 --> 42:51.981
No.

42:52.083 --> 42:55.321
Because if it comes to a deal,
it'll be hard and fast.

42:55.423 --> 42:57.456
I have to have all the cards
in my hand.

42:57.558 --> 42:59.993
Well, half the cards
are in my hand.
Laura.

43:00.095 --> 43:02.062
What do you want me to say?

43:02.165 --> 43:06.196
"Mr. Ford, we have a deal,
but first I must wait until
I ask my wife for permission"?

43:06.298 --> 43:08.029
Yes, you can say that.

43:12.369 --> 43:13.770
You know what?

43:13.872 --> 43:17.041
I'm gonna give you
power of attorney over my stock,

43:17.143 --> 43:18.710
so you can deal.

43:21.282 --> 43:22.951
For half a million dollars.

43:23.053 --> 43:25.084
I don't have half a million!

43:25.186 --> 43:28.049
You will if you make a deal.

43:30.555 --> 43:32.990
Okay, I'll give you a check.

43:33.093 --> 43:34.297
Post-dated.

43:35.997 --> 43:37.631
Not post-dated.

43:37.733 --> 43:39.794
I'll give you a check
on condition you promise
not to cash it

43:39.896 --> 43:42.030
until and unless
the deal goes through.

43:44.006 --> 43:45.407
Is that reasonable?

43:55.314 --> 43:56.583
Is that reasonable?

44:03.024 --> 44:04.327
We need this.

44:05.422 --> 44:06.923
One condition.

44:07.763 --> 44:08.892
What?

44:11.198 --> 44:12.731
I want my gun back.

44:13.296 --> 44:14.601
What?

44:15.972 --> 44:17.505
I want my gun back.

45:11.689 --> 45:14.496
Did you sign de Portago?
Yes.

45:15.131 --> 45:16.795
I'll draw up a contract.

45:18.433 --> 45:20.865
And I need money
for Cecilia Manzini.

45:22.939 --> 45:24.233
How much money?

45:24.335 --> 45:25.936
25,000.

45:26.369 --> 45:27.808
What?

45:27.910 --> 45:29.140
25,000?

45:29.242 --> 45:30.545
She's broke.

45:31.949 --> 45:33.647
Her mother told me.

45:34.478 --> 45:35.777
Her mother?

45:35.879 --> 45:38.014
Have you been
fucking her mother?

45:38.447 --> 45:39.719
What?

45:40.154 --> 45:41.623
Are you crazy?

45:42.059 --> 45:43.987
I want $25,000 in cash.

45:44.089 --> 45:46.625
Ah, you've been fucking
the mother and the daughter.

45:46.727 --> 45:48.627
We have obligations
to that family.
Both.

45:48.730 --> 45:51.931
Oh, obligations.
So compassionate.
Sympathetic.

45:52.033 --> 45:53.634
Bullshit.

45:56.237 --> 45:57.638
Fucking bullshit.

45:58.371 --> 46:00.542
I am compassionate!

46:05.012 --> 46:06.141
Five.

46:07.751 --> 46:08.781
Ten.

46:09.415 --> 46:11.513
Fifteen million lire.

46:11.615 --> 46:14.217
Or 25,000 US dollars.

46:14.319 --> 46:15.524
Please.

46:19.593 --> 46:21.261
How do you want me
to enter this?

46:21.364 --> 46:24.027
As a bequest
to Signora Manzini.

46:24.562 --> 46:26.735
To buy a property.

46:26.837 --> 46:29.438
She'll have the use of it,
but we'll retain the freehold.

46:29.540 --> 46:32.475
Ah, the same arrangement
as in, uh, Castelvetro.

46:33.944 --> 46:35.776
Castelvetro?

46:36.379 --> 46:38.674
We have a property
in Castelfranco.

46:38.776 --> 46:40.141
Oh. Yes, yes.

46:40.243 --> 46:42.947
I'm sorry.
I got the towns confused.

46:51.595 --> 46:54.964
I also need a banker's order
for a new driver.

46:55.066 --> 46:56.525
His name is de Portago.

46:56.627 --> 46:58.194
How do you spell that?

46:58.296 --> 47:00.066
D-E

47:00.168 --> 47:05.233
P-O-R-T-A-G-O.

47:11.112 --> 47:12.680
Thank you.

47:13.577 --> 47:14.946
Thank you.

47:35.401 --> 47:36.737
Castelvetro.

47:39.773 --> 47:42.743
As her gentleness,
the signora, commands.

47:51.615 --> 47:52.918
<i>Commendatore!</i>

47:53.585 --> 47:54.583
The press conference.

48:01.966 --> 48:05.165
He's dating Linda Christian,
that blonde
who follows him around.

48:05.267 --> 48:06.963
Who is?
De Portago.

48:07.066 --> 48:10.570
Tyrone Power
left Rita Hayworth
for the blonde.

48:10.672 --> 48:12.868
She left Tyrone Power
for de Portago.

48:12.970 --> 48:14.636
What are you reading,
<i>Commendatore?</i>

48:14.738 --> 48:16.342
"Rome Merry-Go-Round."

48:16.444 --> 48:19.143
Here's who will be there.

48:19.245 --> 48:22.411
And I will exclude
Di Massimo and Fusaro.
They are the worst.

48:22.514 --> 48:24.015
No, no, no.

48:24.550 --> 48:26.215
I want them there.

48:41.765 --> 48:43.502
So what do you think?

48:43.605 --> 48:46.004
Ah, there is no ashtray.

48:47.705 --> 48:49.405
Are you a prima donna?

48:49.507 --> 48:52.408
You ever tried
flicking ash out of a car
at 200 kilometers an hour?

48:52.510 --> 48:55.717
I'm offering you a brand-new car
which has the edge on Maserati.

48:55.819 --> 48:59.150
Bullshit.
The Maserati is faster
and it has an ashtray.

48:59.252 --> 49:02.724
If I put in an ashtray,
will you drive it
in the Mille Miglia?

49:07.425 --> 49:08.628
Good.

49:08.730 --> 49:10.059
And don't ask me
for a navigator.
Wha--

49:10.162 --> 49:13.133
You know every inch.
You've raced it 16 times.

49:13.869 --> 49:15.734
I can see in your eyes
you're going to ask me,

49:15.836 --> 49:17.836
and I'm not seduced
by you, silver fox.

49:17.939 --> 49:20.335
Get all these cleaned up
before the photo call.

49:21.542 --> 49:23.472
How'd she handle?
Good.

49:24.074 --> 49:26.544
This is not,
"How was lunch?" "Good."

49:26.646 --> 49:28.046
I want to know brake wear.

49:28.148 --> 49:30.985
I want steering, suspension,
gear ratios, final drive.

49:31.087 --> 49:34.023
If it's going to run
in the Mille Miglia,
it's got to be 100%.

49:34.125 --> 49:35.355
Here, talk to him.

49:35.457 --> 49:36.989
Go. Get inside.

49:44.630 --> 49:46.530
Okay, Di Massimo.

49:46.632 --> 49:48.033
Signor Ferrari.

49:49.235 --> 49:51.735
- I'm not an assassin.
- It was a figure of speech.

49:51.838 --> 49:52.902
Uh, <i>Commendato--</i>
Out!

49:53.004 --> 49:54.974
<i>Commendatore.</i>
Out.

49:56.310 --> 49:57.844
Fusaro.

49:57.946 --> 50:00.649
You said I was Saturn
devouring his young children.

50:00.751 --> 50:03.144
I was merely
quoting the Vatican,
<i>Commendatore.</i>

50:03.246 --> 50:06.187
- You too. Out.

50:06.289 --> 50:07.316
And you, Moretti.

50:08.389 --> 50:09.790
A "widow-maker."

50:09.892 --> 50:12.553
For the record, Castellotti
was not married, okay?

50:12.655 --> 50:13.960
Out.

50:15.099 --> 50:16.358
When we win,

50:16.460 --> 50:19.566
I can't see my cars
for shots of starlets' asses.

50:19.668 --> 50:21.368
When we lose,
you're a lynch mob.

50:23.232 --> 50:25.500
It's enough
to make the pope weep.

50:25.602 --> 50:27.105
Next.

50:28.439 --> 50:31.141
Let me introduce
my spring team
for the Mille Miglia.

50:31.243 --> 50:33.942
Signor Ferrari! Ferrari!

50:34.044 --> 50:35.647
This is de Portago,

50:35.749 --> 50:37.879
Castellotti's
replacement.

50:37.981 --> 50:39.587
But he drives
like Varzi.

50:39.689 --> 50:41.751
Hey, Fon, is it true
about Linda Christian?

50:41.853 --> 50:42.951
She's your girlfriend?

50:43.053 --> 50:44.491
Don't answer that question.

50:44.593 --> 50:46.327
This is my old friend Taruffi.

50:46.429 --> 50:47.857
Last time he was second.

50:47.959 --> 50:50.465
This time
he will be first.

50:50.567 --> 50:53.763
Peter Collins.
Future world champion.

50:53.865 --> 50:56.433
Taffy von Trips. A tiger.

50:57.002 --> 50:58.706
And this is
Olivier Gendebien,

50:58.809 --> 51:01.105
the fastest driver
of road cars in the world.

51:04.614 --> 51:06.143
Yes, all together.

51:06.245 --> 51:08.877
Smile.
A smile. Look at me, sir.

51:08.979 --> 51:10.585
Linda! Linda!

51:10.687 --> 51:12.548
Linda, look over here!

51:13.251 --> 51:15.890
Linda, big smile!
A shot of you by the car!

51:16.855 --> 51:18.556
Linda!
Linda, with the car!

51:25.468 --> 51:26.964
Rancati, a word after.

51:27.066 --> 51:29.103
A word after.
Smile!

51:29.206 --> 51:30.234
Hey, Linda!

51:49.752 --> 51:50.717
Stop.

51:50.819 --> 51:52.060
Stop.

51:52.162 --> 51:53.422
Go back.

51:54.395 --> 51:55.457
Go back.

52:07.871 --> 52:09.141
Turn right.

52:32.996 --> 52:34.265
Giuseppe.

52:42.012 --> 52:45.342
Rancati, there's something
I want you to do for me.

52:46.316 --> 52:48.010
Write an article

52:48.113 --> 52:51.718
suggesting
that there are rumors

52:51.820 --> 52:54.655
that I'm talking
to Henry Ford II

52:54.757 --> 52:56.584
about the future
of the factory.

52:57.893 --> 53:01.530
At the end,
say you asked me, bluntly,

53:01.632 --> 53:04.427
and that
I categorically denied it.

53:06.033 --> 53:08.869
And are you?
Categorically denying it?

53:08.971 --> 53:11.566
Ah, yes, of course.
Categorically, I deny it.

53:14.610 --> 53:16.340
If I write this article,

53:17.607 --> 53:20.113
will you give me an exclusive
on your private life?

53:21.679 --> 53:23.584
Yes.

53:23.687 --> 53:25.349
If you promise
not to publish it.

53:28.084 --> 53:29.617
For the time being.

53:30.185 --> 53:32.092
Until I authorize it.

53:34.860 --> 53:37.427
Okay. It's a deal.

56:05.649 --> 56:07.108
You're going tonight?

56:07.210 --> 56:09.216
Yes. With my friends.

56:30.474 --> 56:31.601
He's quiet.

56:33.307 --> 56:35.269
I didn't get him
de Portago's autograph.

56:35.371 --> 56:37.545
It's not about that.

56:37.647 --> 56:39.144
What is it about?

56:39.246 --> 56:41.413
In two weeks,
he'll be confirmed.

56:41.979 --> 56:43.317
As whom?

56:43.886 --> 56:46.121
Piero Lardi
or Piero Ferrari?

56:48.290 --> 56:50.985
We said when he was ten,
we would sort this out.

56:51.087 --> 56:54.723
Then Dino's illness got worse,
and he's still Piero Lardi.

56:55.665 --> 56:57.099
I'm out of excuses.

56:58.097 --> 56:59.427
Postpone the confirmation.

56:59.529 --> 57:01.868
His whole class
is being confirmed.

57:01.970 --> 57:03.667
Say he lost
his faith in God.

57:03.769 --> 57:04.832
Enzo.

57:05.709 --> 57:07.474
Who else knows about him?

57:07.576 --> 57:08.908
Nobody.

57:09.010 --> 57:10.772
Apart from
the chief of police.

57:11.515 --> 57:12.580
The doctor?

57:12.682 --> 57:14.011
Well, yes, the doctor.

57:14.113 --> 57:15.681
And Piero's teachers.

57:15.783 --> 57:16.847
The teachers.

57:16.949 --> 57:18.619
Tavoni, Sergio.

57:18.721 --> 57:19.917
Of course, Tavoni.

57:20.019 --> 57:21.083
And the bank manager?

57:21.185 --> 57:22.416
The bank manager.

57:22.518 --> 57:24.186
Enzo.
Apart from them, no one.

57:24.288 --> 57:26.990
Enzo, this is Italy. Yes?

57:27.092 --> 57:28.463
All of Modena knows!

57:28.565 --> 57:30.165
Except Laura.

57:31.427 --> 57:33.161
And that must stay as it is.

57:33.263 --> 57:34.796
Especially for now.

57:36.805 --> 57:41.536
Oh, you're going to tell me,
"Enzo, don't be so bourgeois,
so Italian."

57:41.638 --> 57:44.139
Don't make me sound
like a beatnik.

57:44.241 --> 57:45.774
You read French books.

57:49.449 --> 57:51.681
What happened between us
in the war happened.

57:52.248 --> 57:53.855
As with many.

57:53.957 --> 57:55.619
And sometimes
I wish it didn't.

57:59.025 --> 58:00.525
How can you say that?

58:01.394 --> 58:03.565
Because if I was a woman
like I am now,

58:03.667 --> 58:04.959
not 12 years ago,

58:05.061 --> 58:07.862
I would not have interfered
in another woman's marriage.

58:10.302 --> 58:12.372
And now she's lost a child.

58:13.505 --> 58:15.605
But the present is
what the present is.

58:15.707 --> 58:19.874
And in our world here,
between me and you and Piero,

58:21.345 --> 58:23.746
what is best for Piero?

58:25.821 --> 58:27.552
Who speaks for him?

58:32.322 --> 58:33.855
You're his father.

58:38.362 --> 58:40.829
How do we reconcile this?

58:41.803 --> 58:43.370
I don't know.

58:45.336 --> 58:47.341
But that makes it no less.

59:12.230 --> 59:13.966
Aren't you coming?

59:14.068 --> 59:16.634
No. Make an excuse for me.

59:17.367 --> 59:19.241
The cash for Cecilia?

59:19.942 --> 59:21.606
Brown envelope by the door.

01:00:12.024 --> 01:00:15.095
What's this I hear about you
looking for outside investors?

01:00:15.197 --> 01:00:16.728
Fangio eating up
all your money?

01:00:16.830 --> 01:00:20.200
No. With television,
it's going to become
big business.

01:00:20.302 --> 01:00:22.469
To do this,
one has to be capitalized.

01:00:23.632 --> 01:00:25.398
The game is changing, Enzo.

01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:28.970
And this outside capital
will magically bestow
its favors upon Maserati.

01:00:29.072 --> 01:00:32.072
Of course.
After we win the Mille Miglia.

01:03:48.340 --> 01:03:49.643
I'm pregnant.

01:04:32.548 --> 01:04:34.818
<i>Hawthorn is third,
Fangio and Collins...</i>

01:04:34.920 --> 01:04:36.620
Where is everybody?

01:04:36.722 --> 01:04:38.153
I gave them the day off.

01:04:38.255 --> 01:04:40.291
No wonder
you're so late with everything.

01:04:40.393 --> 01:04:42.189
Enzo, it's Sunday.

01:04:42.291 --> 01:04:44.491
My men work weekends
all through the year for you.

01:04:46.331 --> 01:04:48.696
Their children haven't seen them
since the day they were born.

01:04:48.798 --> 01:04:53.235
That's very sad.
Here's to you and that pack
of color-blind louts you employ.

01:04:53.337 --> 01:04:56.806
<i>De Portago is slowing down,
having overshot on the braking.</i>

01:04:56.908 --> 01:04:59.706
<i>Mrs. Vanderbilt and Cooper
watch excitedly</i>

01:04:59.808 --> 01:05:04.718
<i>as Lewis-Evans goes through
in the straight
followed by Musso's Ferrari.</i>

01:05:04.820 --> 01:05:08.855
<i>Vanwall leads the race,
averaging 120 miles per hour.</i>

01:05:08.957 --> 01:05:12.919
<i>Musso makes his tires smoke
as he strains all his nerves</i>

01:05:13.022 --> 01:05:15.062
<i>to try and close down the gap.</i>

01:05:15.164 --> 01:05:18.466
<i>We got word of a collision
between the BRM
and the Cooper-Climax.</i>

01:05:18.568 --> 01:05:22.230
<i>Oh! There is a lot of smoke,
making it very--</i>

01:05:42.457 --> 01:05:43.856
What is <i>problema?</i>

01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:53.664
Oh, no.

01:05:53.766 --> 01:05:55.362
Is she operable?
Ah, that's bad.

01:05:56.733 --> 01:05:58.200
Bad, bad. Very bad.

01:06:08.581 --> 01:06:14.655
<i>With three laps to go,
after Fangio, Musso,
it's Behra and de Portago.</i>

01:06:14.757 --> 01:06:17.054
<i>He's trying all he knows
to close the gap.</i>

01:06:26.832 --> 01:06:30.936
<i>De Portago!
And he brakes first!</i>

01:06:47.982 --> 01:06:49.350
Call in de Portago.

01:06:52.228 --> 01:06:53.321
Hurry up. Hurry up.

01:07:05.604 --> 01:07:06.833
Fon. Fon.

01:07:06.935 --> 01:07:08.640
What?
Out.

01:07:08.742 --> 01:07:11.207
What?
Out! Peter's taking over.

01:07:14.778 --> 01:07:16.278
Thank you, old bean.

01:07:18.550 --> 01:07:20.887
Go, go, go!

01:07:24.787 --> 01:07:26.222
What happened?

01:07:34.733 --> 01:07:36.232
I could have taken him.

01:07:37.166 --> 01:07:38.905
<i>You lack commitment.</i>

01:07:43.104 --> 01:07:45.043
Look at the Maserati team.

01:07:46.181 --> 01:07:47.375
Fangio.

01:07:47.809 --> 01:07:49.080
Behra.

01:07:50.219 --> 01:07:51.786
Stirling Moss.

01:07:52.683 --> 01:07:54.349
Hard-nosed pros.

01:07:55.823 --> 01:07:59.387
Men with a brutal
determination to win.

01:08:02.061 --> 01:08:04.865
With a cruel emptiness
in their stomachs.

01:08:05.696 --> 01:08:07.197
Detachment.

01:08:08.230 --> 01:08:10.898
Loyal to one thing--
not the team.

01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:13.071
Loyal to their lust to win.

01:08:14.539 --> 01:08:16.140
It rains.

01:08:16.242 --> 01:08:19.774
The track is slippery with oil,
an evil-handling car.

01:08:19.876 --> 01:08:21.578
Will they falter? No.

01:08:21.680 --> 01:08:23.279
My spring team.

01:08:24.717 --> 01:08:27.584
Courageous? Skillful? Yes.

01:08:27.686 --> 01:08:29.318
Recently in school.

01:08:31.861 --> 01:08:35.225
Aristocrats, straight
from <i>Almanach de Gotha.</i>

01:08:36.532 --> 01:08:39.394
Gentlemen sportsmen.
Very nice.

01:08:42.103 --> 01:08:44.670
On the straight
into the tight corner
at Nouveau Monde,

01:08:44.772 --> 01:08:46.634
there's only one line
through it.

01:08:47.304 --> 01:08:50.639
Behra pulls up next to you, challenging.

01:08:50.741 --> 01:08:52.676
You're even.

01:08:52.778 --> 01:08:56.950
But two objects cannot occupy
the same point in space
at the same moment in time.

01:08:57.585 --> 01:08:59.716
Behra doesn't lift.

01:08:59.818 --> 01:09:01.985
The corner races at you.

01:09:02.087 --> 01:09:04.525
You have perhaps
a crisis of identity:

01:09:04.627 --> 01:09:07.126
"Am I a sportsman
or a competitor?"

01:09:07.228 --> 01:09:10.528
"How will the French think of me
if I run Behra into a tree?"

01:09:10.630 --> 01:09:13.234
You lift, he passes.

01:09:13.336 --> 01:09:15.298
He won, you lose!

01:09:20.572 --> 01:09:24.406
Because at that same moment
Behra thought,
"Fuck it, we both die."

01:09:29.217 --> 01:09:32.820
Make no mistake,
all of us are racers--
or have been.

01:09:32.922 --> 01:09:36.023
We all are certain,
"It will never happen to me."

01:09:36.125 --> 01:09:40.153
Then my friend is killed.
I give up racing forever
on Monday.

01:09:40.255 --> 01:09:42.259
I'm back racing by Sunday.

01:09:43.832 --> 01:09:46.065
We all know
it's our deadly passion.

01:09:50.373 --> 01:09:51.972
Our terrible joy.

01:09:56.943 --> 01:09:58.878
But if you get
into one of my cars--

01:09:58.980 --> 01:10:01.678
and no one is forcing you
to take that seat--

01:10:01.780 --> 01:10:03.379
you get in to win.

01:10:06.685 --> 01:10:07.955
Brake later.

01:10:09.953 --> 01:10:11.585
Steal their line.

01:10:16.126 --> 01:10:18.295
Make them make the mistake.

01:10:36.882 --> 01:10:38.646
I would have taken him.

01:10:38.748 --> 01:10:40.185
Behra.

01:10:50.065 --> 01:10:52.259
I'm changing the lineup
for the Mille Miglia.

01:10:52.361 --> 01:10:54.565
I want you and Olivier
to swap cars.

01:10:54.667 --> 01:10:58.105
He'll drive the little coupe
and you'll take one
of the 335's.

01:10:58.207 --> 01:11:00.537
You're giving me one
of the most powerful cars
in the race.

01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:04.704
Well, put it another way:
I'm giving Olivier
the more agile coupe.

01:11:05.612 --> 01:11:06.941
Won't he mind?

01:11:07.710 --> 01:11:10.347
Well, of course he will,
but he'll beat you anyway.

01:11:17.759 --> 01:11:19.522
This is
the power of attorney

01:11:19.624 --> 01:11:22.524
which Signor Ferrari requested
that you put your name on.

01:11:23.091 --> 01:11:25.530
And the check

01:11:25.632 --> 01:11:27.969
for $500,000.

01:11:30.804 --> 01:11:32.303
It has not been signed.

01:11:34.973 --> 01:11:41.142
The signing of these affidavits
was conditional on the exchange
of the check.

01:11:41.244 --> 01:11:42.812
I'm sure
it was an oversight.

01:11:42.914 --> 01:11:44.711
Bullshit, Cosetti.

01:11:47.115 --> 01:11:48.487
Go away, please.

01:11:48.589 --> 01:11:49.617
Give me a pen.

01:12:23.854 --> 01:12:25.125
Excellent.

01:12:31.529 --> 01:12:35.729
I'll hold on to these
until I get my check signed.

01:12:40.606 --> 01:12:41.871
And...

01:12:42.874 --> 01:12:48.315
I want information
about special payments made
by the factory last year.

01:12:48.417 --> 01:12:49.809
To whom?

01:12:50.981 --> 01:12:53.054
Lina Lardi.

01:12:55.150 --> 01:12:56.817
Lina Lardi.

01:12:57.387 --> 01:12:59.060
I want to know
how much they are.

01:12:59.162 --> 01:13:02.228
I want to know for how long
they've been going on.

01:13:19.744 --> 01:13:20.579
Yes.

01:13:20.681 --> 01:13:21.678
<i>Enzo.</i>

01:13:21.781 --> 01:13:23.612
Lina Lardi.

01:13:24.347 --> 01:13:26.582
What does that name mean to you?

01:13:30.857 --> 01:13:32.754
<i>The boy is yours?</i>

01:13:32.856 --> 01:13:34.095
Yes.

01:13:43.234 --> 01:13:44.864
I need to think about this.

01:14:16.737 --> 01:14:18.601
She found out.

01:14:19.741 --> 01:14:21.835
The boy?
That too.

01:14:24.845 --> 01:14:26.875
So what do you think?

01:14:27.511 --> 01:14:29.244
The driver in front
will piss his pants

01:14:29.347 --> 01:14:31.284
when he sees it
in his mirror.

01:14:32.787 --> 01:14:34.520
And when it passes,

01:14:35.223 --> 01:14:37.818
it has an ass on it
like a Canova sculpture.

01:14:39.122 --> 01:14:40.628
So what do I do?

01:14:40.730 --> 01:14:42.462
What do you want to do?

01:14:42.564 --> 01:14:43.595
Leave her.

01:14:43.697 --> 01:14:45.760
So, do it.

01:14:49.036 --> 01:14:51.271
You see that pigeon
up there?

01:14:52.835 --> 01:14:56.503
I left its door open,
but it won't come out.

01:14:56.605 --> 01:14:58.539
It's forgotten
what freedom is.

01:14:58.641 --> 01:15:01.182
Freedom for that pigeon
is pigeon pie.

01:15:08.486 --> 01:15:11.825
Tell Laura that you two
should live apart,

01:15:11.928 --> 01:15:13.687
you are going
to live with Lina,

01:15:13.789 --> 01:15:15.589
and that you are going
to recognize the boy.

01:15:15.691 --> 01:15:18.057
Everybody thinks
that you should anyway.

01:15:18.159 --> 01:15:21.235
I don't give a damn
what everybody thinks.
What do you think?

01:15:24.869 --> 01:15:28.242
There are a lot of people
on your payroll with families.

01:15:29.507 --> 01:15:32.642
Ferrari needs continuity
to stay Ferrari.

01:15:54.967 --> 01:15:56.468
We have history.

01:16:07.414 --> 01:16:09.613
Stay there, pigeon,
or you're dead meat.

01:16:22.725 --> 01:16:25.497
The whole of Emilia knows,
but not me?

01:16:29.071 --> 01:16:31.466
I thought
it would break your heart.

01:16:31.568 --> 01:16:33.934
You broke my heart
years ago, Enzo.

01:16:38.979 --> 01:16:40.545
When did it start?

01:16:41.980 --> 01:16:43.142
The war.

01:16:43.745 --> 01:16:45.946
The factory had
been bombed twice.

01:16:47.452 --> 01:16:49.320
Uh, it began during
the worst of it.

01:16:49.422 --> 01:16:52.221
She worked
at Carrozzeria Orlandi.

01:16:52.323 --> 01:16:55.857
You and Dino were in the hills
that year, and by Christmas
she was pregnant.

01:16:57.025 --> 01:16:59.894
So I bought Castelvetro
and she went to live there.

01:17:01.037 --> 01:17:04.668
Is she different
from the others?

01:17:09.043 --> 01:17:10.740
I was in love with her.

01:17:12.748 --> 01:17:14.315
And I still am.

01:17:19.583 --> 01:17:22.615
I find myself
sharing my whole life

01:17:22.717 --> 01:17:24.952
with a woman
I have never met.

01:17:31.461 --> 01:17:33.863
It makes a mockery of you

01:17:34.466 --> 01:17:37.470
in the years
when our son was ill.

01:17:38.401 --> 01:17:39.670
When he was dying.

01:17:40.370 --> 01:17:41.936
How can you say that?

01:17:43.305 --> 01:17:44.541
That boy,

01:17:44.643 --> 01:17:47.781
is he going to inherit
our factory, our name?

01:17:48.450 --> 01:17:50.817
'Cause I don't want him to.
We have a son.

01:17:50.919 --> 01:17:52.716
One son, two sons.

01:17:53.216 --> 01:17:54.480
Five sons.

01:17:54.582 --> 01:17:56.556
I miss Dino any less?

01:17:57.259 --> 01:17:59.292
Every morning I see him
in the cemetery.

01:17:59.395 --> 01:18:02.457
The hospital he died in
is funded in his name.

01:18:02.560 --> 01:18:04.392
A school was built
in his honor!

01:18:04.494 --> 01:18:06.329
Honor? Who gives a shit?

01:18:06.431 --> 01:18:08.127
You were supposed to save him!

01:18:09.070 --> 01:18:10.229
You blame me for his death?

01:18:10.331 --> 01:18:11.667
Yes!

01:18:11.769 --> 01:18:14.034
Yes, because you promised me
he wouldn't die!

01:18:14.843 --> 01:18:16.172
Everything.

01:18:16.274 --> 01:18:17.705
I did everything.

01:18:17.807 --> 01:18:19.979
Tables showing
what calories he could eat.

01:18:20.081 --> 01:18:21.713
What went in, what came out.

01:18:21.815 --> 01:18:25.914
I graphed the degrees
of albuminuria,
the degrees of azotemia!

01:18:26.447 --> 01:18:27.817
Diuresis!

01:18:27.919 --> 01:18:30.589
I know more about nephritis
and dystrophy than cars!

01:18:30.691 --> 01:18:33.553
Yes, I blame you!
I blame you
'cause you let him die.

01:18:33.655 --> 01:18:35.858
The father deluded himself!

01:18:37.328 --> 01:18:39.462
The great engineer!

01:18:39.564 --> 01:18:41.831
"I will restore my son
to health."

01:18:41.933 --> 01:18:45.870
Swiss doctors, Italian doctors.
Bullshit. I could not.

01:18:45.972 --> 01:18:47.533
I did not!

01:18:47.635 --> 01:18:50.909
'Cause you were
so consoled at Castelvetro,
you lost your attention.

01:18:51.011 --> 01:18:54.808
You had another boy
growing stronger
while Dino was getting weaker!

01:18:54.910 --> 01:18:57.917
What goes on in your mind?
He got sick.

01:18:58.019 --> 01:19:00.546
Dystrophy. Kidneys!

01:19:00.648 --> 01:19:02.888
It destroyed him!

01:19:02.990 --> 01:19:03.923
It destroyed us.

01:19:04.025 --> 01:19:05.292
What do you care? Huh?

01:19:05.394 --> 01:19:06.886
You have another son!
You have another wife!

01:19:06.988 --> 01:19:10.860
She's not my wife.
But he is my son.

01:19:15.430 --> 01:19:16.701
Move out.

01:19:30.612 --> 01:19:36.050
These are the papers.
They give you power
to negotiate on my behalf.

01:19:38.756 --> 01:19:41.293
And there is a problem
with your check.

01:19:41.395 --> 01:19:43.860
You forgot to
put your name on it.

01:19:51.335 --> 01:19:53.067
We are partners.

01:19:54.243 --> 01:19:56.510
This is a gun
pointed at our head.

01:19:59.440 --> 01:20:03.982
You cash it
before I conclude the deal,
Ferrari is no more.

01:20:04.084 --> 01:20:05.651
That's right.

01:20:23.204 --> 01:20:24.538
It's done.

01:20:25.368 --> 01:20:26.705
She knows.

01:20:38.780 --> 01:20:40.620
You'll come to Modena.

01:20:41.218 --> 01:20:42.556
What?

01:20:42.990 --> 01:20:44.019
Why not?

01:20:44.786 --> 01:20:46.358
Modena is where I live.

01:20:46.460 --> 01:20:49.728
It's not me.
It's about Piero.

01:20:50.791 --> 01:20:52.764
Does he sneak around?

01:20:53.363 --> 01:20:54.766
As whom?

01:20:57.403 --> 01:20:59.270
She knows he is our boy?

01:20:59.372 --> 01:21:01.872
She knows he is my son.

01:21:03.542 --> 01:21:05.942
But nothing has been resolved.

01:21:08.509 --> 01:21:09.748
Yeah.

01:21:25.595 --> 01:21:27.096
Hey, Papa!

01:21:27.532 --> 01:21:29.200
De Portago's autograph.

01:21:29.302 --> 01:21:30.869
You go back to sleep.

01:21:30.971 --> 01:21:32.298
Papa!

01:21:33.738 --> 01:21:36.768
Fer-ra-ri! Fer-ra-ri!

01:21:36.870 --> 01:21:40.106
Fer-ra-ri! Fer-ra-ri!

01:21:40.208 --> 01:21:45.115
Fer-ra-ri! Fer-ra-ri!
Fer-ra-ri! Fer-ra-ri!

01:21:45.217 --> 01:21:48.448
Fer-ra-ri! Fer-ra-ri!

01:22:27.027 --> 01:22:29.729
Signor Ferrari.
<i>Commendatore</i> Ferrari!

01:22:31.266 --> 01:22:32.593
Mr. Ferrari!

01:22:39.641 --> 01:22:42.203
-  Ferrari!
- He's here.

01:22:43.003 --> 01:22:44.511
Peter.
How are you doing?

01:22:44.613 --> 01:22:46.772
Okay, here we go.
Come here. Come this way.

01:22:46.874 --> 01:22:48.343
This is Peter Collins.

01:22:52.053 --> 01:22:53.348
All right.

01:22:53.451 --> 01:22:54.688
Let's go.

01:22:57.156 --> 01:23:00.860
This is my new friend,
de Portago,
our newest driver.

01:23:00.962 --> 01:23:01.992
Okay.

01:23:05.629 --> 01:23:07.465
Good luck, gentlemen.

01:23:07.568 --> 01:23:09.335
Good afternoon,
<i>Commendatore.</i>

01:23:09.437 --> 01:23:11.837
Registration forms, licenses.

01:23:15.442 --> 01:23:16.908
Good afternoon, gentlemen.

01:23:19.775 --> 01:23:22.211
Good afternoon, Orsi.

01:23:22.680 --> 01:23:24.311
Good afternoon, Ferrari.

01:23:26.552 --> 01:23:28.083
I'm entering five cars.

01:23:28.185 --> 01:23:32.825
Collins, Taruffi,
de Portago, von Trips,
Gendebien.

01:23:50.139 --> 01:23:51.675
Are you making them richer?

01:23:51.777 --> 01:23:53.439
Yes, for the humidity.

01:23:55.617 --> 01:23:58.043
No sleeping. Especially you.

01:24:08.357 --> 01:24:11.030
Good evening, <i>Commendatore.</i>
And to you, my friend.

01:24:11.132 --> 01:24:14.164
<i>...of the smallest
of the racing cars.</i>

01:24:14.266 --> 01:24:17.097
<i>Painted on each of the cars
is the time of its departure.</i>

01:24:17.199 --> 01:24:19.237
No,
judges should be at Ravenna.

01:24:19.339 --> 01:24:20.774
Okay.

01:24:22.971 --> 01:24:26.509
Make sure they show these
at every control.
Otherwise they're disqualified.

01:24:26.611 --> 01:24:30.312
<i>I'm honored
to have at my side
the owner of Maserati,</i>

01:24:30.781 --> 01:24:32.884
Cavaliere <i>Adolfo Orsi.</i>

01:24:32.986 --> 01:24:35.954
All right, I have a few
last-minute instructions.

01:24:37.521 --> 01:24:39.022
Refueling.

01:24:39.124 --> 01:24:42.525
Remind the mechanics
the gas is to go into the tanks,

01:24:42.627 --> 01:24:43.994
not on the drivers.

01:24:44.096 --> 01:24:47.163
Especially Taruffi.
I prefer he not go up in flames.

01:25:27.676 --> 01:25:30.437
I'm writing to Linda.
What do I say?

01:25:32.009 --> 01:25:34.375
I don't know. Um...

01:25:54.833 --> 01:25:56.330
<i>My darling Louise.</i>

01:25:56.432 --> 01:25:59.532
<i>The same letter
I write before every race.</i>

01:25:59.634 --> 01:26:03.142
<i>I have no worry for myself
in this race, as ever.</i>

01:26:03.244 --> 01:26:06.805
<i>My only fear
is that you will need me
and I won't be here.</i>

01:26:06.907 --> 01:26:12.380
<i>In that unlikely eventuality,
know you have
all my love always.</i>

01:27:03.637 --> 01:27:05.230
Remember what I told you.

01:27:05.333 --> 01:27:08.771
Get behind Taruffi and Collins.

01:27:08.873 --> 01:27:10.739
Okay? They know the way.

01:27:10.841 --> 01:27:14.940
If you can hang on to them
till you reach Bologna,
you're in with a chance.

01:27:15.042 --> 01:27:16.378
One last thing.

01:27:26.088 --> 01:27:27.992
Can you autograph this?

01:27:28.094 --> 01:27:31.030
It's for a very,
very special young man.

01:27:31.598 --> 01:27:32.658
What's his name?

01:27:33.366 --> 01:27:34.429
Piero.

01:27:35.236 --> 01:27:36.134
Piero!

01:27:36.964 --> 01:27:40.237
P-I-E-R-O.

01:27:41.138 --> 01:27:43.442
If Moss and Behra
attempt to pass,

01:27:43.544 --> 01:27:45.107
wave them through.

01:27:45.209 --> 01:27:47.981
Your job is to get round
in one piece.

01:27:48.648 --> 01:27:50.282
See you in Bologna!

01:27:50.384 --> 01:27:51.383
Good luck.

01:27:53.181 --> 01:27:55.321
Ready? Go.

01:27:59.923 --> 01:28:02.758
-  Good morning, Peter.
- And it's going
to be a good one.

01:28:02.860 --> 01:28:04.595
This car can win.

01:28:04.697 --> 01:28:06.998
Once you're over the mountains,
you've got the legs
on the others.

01:28:07.101 --> 01:28:10.099
Then it's either you
or de Portago, understand?

01:28:10.201 --> 01:28:11.864
Are you forgetting
about Moss and Behra?

01:28:11.966 --> 01:28:15.338
Watch out for stray dogs
and children.
They're the real danger.

01:28:17.477 --> 01:28:18.539
All right.

01:28:28.053 --> 01:28:30.218
Here you are.
Ah, <i>si.</i>

01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:33.827
You can win this one, Taruffi,
if you don't smoke yourself
to death before it's over.

01:28:33.929 --> 01:28:35.688
What's the weather like
on the Futa Pass?

01:28:36.223 --> 01:28:37.423
Good. Maybe rain.

01:28:37.525 --> 01:28:39.864
Listen to me.
You need this race.

01:28:39.966 --> 01:28:41.731
How can you tell
your grandchildren

01:28:41.833 --> 01:28:45.231
that you picked up
every trophy in Europe
but you've never won at Brescia?

01:28:45.333 --> 01:28:46.839
Make sure I get the backup.

01:28:46.941 --> 01:28:49.842
No foul-ups.
Especially at the fuel stops.

01:28:49.944 --> 01:28:51.608
All right, that's the spirit.

01:28:59.281 --> 01:29:01.383
Stirling, are we all set?
Yes.

01:29:01.485 --> 01:29:05.422
Take the lead right away
and stay in front.
Sure.

01:29:05.524 --> 01:29:06.719
Great.

01:29:14.533 --> 01:29:15.735
Jean,

01:29:15.837 --> 01:29:18.897
you stay back
behind the Ferraris.

01:29:18.999 --> 01:29:20.136
Wait.

01:29:20.238 --> 01:29:22.773
Some will break,
eliminate themselves.

01:29:22.875 --> 01:29:25.477
Then attack before Bologna.

01:29:25.579 --> 01:29:26.337
Okay?
Okay.

01:29:57.204 --> 01:29:58.573
Good to see you.

01:30:03.950 --> 01:30:05.781
For once
he did not complain.

01:30:49.896 --> 01:30:51.464
Do you know the way ahead?

01:30:51.566 --> 01:30:52.726
I'm not sure.

01:31:37.210 --> 01:31:39.476
Okay,
let's see what she can do.

01:31:55.256 --> 01:31:56.790
Let him go, Fon.

01:32:47.114 --> 01:32:49.612
No brakes.
Bloody pedal snapped off!

01:32:51.713 --> 01:32:53.583
Let's get this bugger home.

01:32:57.656 --> 01:32:59.617
<i>The first car into Ravenna
this morning</i>

01:32:59.719 --> 01:33:01.688
<i>was Peter Collins's Ferrari</i>

01:33:01.791 --> 01:33:07.128
<i>and a Fiat 500 timed
at 140 on the final section.</i>

01:33:07.230 --> 01:33:08.796
Magi, it's Ferrari.

01:33:32.254 --> 01:33:33.623
Moss is out.

01:34:09.996 --> 01:34:11.463
On this, straight.

01:34:48.462 --> 01:34:49.765
What's next?

01:35:12.090 --> 01:35:13.524
<i>Commendatore?</i>

01:35:13.626 --> 01:35:15.427
<i>Avvocato</i> Agnelli's
on the phone.
All right.

01:35:15.529 --> 01:35:18.431
Uh, sit down, gentlemen.
Excuse me for one moment.

01:35:28.941 --> 01:35:30.335
<i>Avvocato.</i>

01:35:30.437 --> 01:35:33.572
I apologize for calling
in the middle
of the race, Ferrari.

01:35:33.674 --> 01:35:38.346
But I have this article
by Rancati in front of me
that is, uh, so disturbing.

01:35:38.448 --> 01:35:40.079
<i>Avvocato,</i> it's fiction.

01:35:40.181 --> 01:35:43.522
I have absolutely no idea
where they get their stories.

01:35:47.291 --> 01:35:49.061
This is important.

01:35:49.164 --> 01:35:51.095
Ferrari cannot go
to foreigners.

01:35:51.197 --> 01:35:53.232
You are a national treasure.

01:35:53.334 --> 01:35:55.998
<i>A "jewel in the crown of Italy."</i>

01:35:56.100 --> 01:35:57.236
Exactly.

01:35:57.338 --> 01:35:59.105
Then why does the jewel
have to scrimp

01:35:59.207 --> 01:36:00.603
to put its cars
into every race?

01:36:00.705 --> 01:36:03.271
If it's that bad,
why didn't you call me?

01:36:03.373 --> 01:36:05.170
I did. You said no.

01:36:06.740 --> 01:36:08.946
Impossible. When was this?

01:36:09.048 --> 01:36:11.345
1917.
<i>Stop it.</i>

01:36:11.447 --> 01:36:13.051
You were a child.

01:36:13.153 --> 01:36:15.154
I was 19. I needed a job.

01:36:15.256 --> 01:36:17.089
A secretary came back
with a card.

01:36:17.191 --> 01:36:18.854
One word written on it:
"No."

01:36:19.588 --> 01:36:21.556
That was a long time ago.

01:36:21.658 --> 01:36:24.191
In business,
each day is a new day.

01:36:24.894 --> 01:36:28.567
Well, the personality
of Fiat is timeless.

01:36:28.669 --> 01:36:30.833
The offer you would make me
will be full of conditions.

01:36:30.935 --> 01:36:33.731
<i>That is not so.</i>
My bosses will be
bookkeepers in Turin.

01:36:33.833 --> 01:36:35.433
<i>We should talk this over.</i>

01:36:36.136 --> 01:36:38.944
If you're looking
for financial assistance,

01:36:39.046 --> 01:36:40.812
talk to me, please.

01:36:40.914 --> 01:36:42.075
Not Ford.

01:36:42.984 --> 01:36:44.881
You're busy now.

01:36:45.417 --> 01:36:48.419
<i>Call me after the Mille Miglia.</i>

01:36:48.521 --> 01:36:50.589
I'll call you
first thing tomorrow.

01:36:57.897 --> 01:36:59.499
Okay.

01:37:26.591 --> 01:37:28.055
Yup?

01:38:08.766 --> 01:38:11.037
When you get to Bologna,
change the rubber.

01:38:11.139 --> 01:38:13.002
I will call ahead.
Hi.

01:38:13.104 --> 01:38:14.334
Hey.

01:38:15.237 --> 01:38:18.974
Meet me in Brescia.
I can't.
I have a camera test.

01:38:19.674 --> 01:38:21.273
I am going to win.

01:38:23.316 --> 01:38:24.749
I want you to be there.

01:41:28.501 --> 01:41:29.835
Took a shortcut?

01:41:30.602 --> 01:41:32.134
Yeah.
Come on.

01:41:50.420 --> 01:41:51.450
Hey.

01:42:04.670 --> 01:42:06.201
Your keys?

01:42:08.837 --> 01:42:11.041
Oh, <i>grazie. Grazie.</i>

01:42:17.383 --> 01:42:19.016
<i>Buongiorno.</i>

01:42:32.730 --> 01:42:34.533
How much time do you have?

01:42:34.635 --> 01:42:36.363
First cars arrive
in about an hour.

01:42:37.470 --> 01:42:38.696
About half past 2:00.

01:42:38.798 --> 01:42:40.037
Mmm.

01:43:07.164 --> 01:43:09.902
Everything okay?
No, the transmission
is gone.

01:43:10.004 --> 01:43:12.067
I don't know
if it's the gears
or the rear axle,

01:43:12.170 --> 01:43:14.735
but the bloody thing's
buggered either way.

01:43:14.837 --> 01:43:15.903
Who's behind me?

01:43:16.006 --> 01:43:18.640
Everyone.
You're in the lead.

01:43:18.742 --> 01:43:20.741
What about Moss?
Out.

01:43:20.843 --> 01:43:22.175
When?
Before Padua.

01:43:22.277 --> 01:43:24.477
Why didn't you tell me?

01:43:25.312 --> 01:43:27.447
It was Moss
I was worried about.

01:43:28.254 --> 01:43:29.486
Well,

01:43:30.356 --> 01:43:33.156
I've fucked
the bloody transmission up
now, haven't I?

01:43:35.828 --> 01:43:38.359
Kid, you want Collins's banana?

01:43:41.031 --> 01:43:43.763
Peter, you can do it.
Take it easy.

01:44:04.692 --> 01:44:06.919
Thank you very much.
Best of luck.

01:44:07.021 --> 01:44:08.257
Thank you.

01:44:09.356 --> 01:44:11.757
Taruffi, I gave you
a brand-new car.

01:44:11.860 --> 01:44:12.826
Look at it!

01:44:12.928 --> 01:44:14.559
The rear axle is bent.

01:44:14.661 --> 01:44:17.970
I only have the first,
third and the fourth gear.

01:44:27.176 --> 01:44:30.044
What happened?
I went off. Futa Pass.

01:44:30.146 --> 01:44:31.945
You're a passenger
in a Ferrari.

01:44:32.047 --> 01:44:33.579
You should have walked!

01:44:35.486 --> 01:44:37.955
All right.
Any more damage--
I don't think it can make it.

01:44:38.057 --> 01:44:39.956
Any more damage, Taruffi,
and you pay for it.

01:44:40.058 --> 01:44:42.390
<i>Commendatore,</i>
now that Maserati's out,

01:44:42.492 --> 01:44:45.093
we are in danger of running
the cars into the ground.

01:44:45.195 --> 01:44:46.862
Order the drivers
to hold their positions.

01:44:46.964 --> 01:44:48.759
Yeah, why bother? They won't.

01:44:48.861 --> 01:44:51.499
Any problems, Olivier?
You're the head of your class.

01:44:51.601 --> 01:44:53.736
- I'm going to win this outright.
- All right, and you can.

01:44:53.838 --> 01:44:57.205
Collins's back axle is gone.
There's a problem
with Taffy's transmission.

01:44:57.307 --> 01:44:59.010
That leaves Taruffi,
and he's lost a gear.

01:44:59.112 --> 01:45:01.105
So it's me and de Portago.
You and de Portago.

01:45:01.207 --> 01:45:03.112
Okay, let's go. Go.

01:45:03.214 --> 01:45:04.944
But if we continue
at this pace--

01:45:05.046 --> 01:45:08.452
For the future of the factory--
My factory is built on racing.

01:45:08.554 --> 01:45:10.022
They are racers.

01:45:11.822 --> 01:45:13.055
I think I can make it.

01:45:13.157 --> 01:45:15.088
You better, you geriatric.

01:45:15.190 --> 01:45:18.026
If you don't finish
in the first three, your wife
will never speak to you again.

01:45:18.128 --> 01:45:20.758
Nor your children.
Okay, go for it!

01:45:26.704 --> 01:45:27.966
How is Behra?

01:45:28.068 --> 01:45:29.474
He's okay.

01:45:29.576 --> 01:45:30.501
He kept coming.

01:45:30.603 --> 01:45:33.511
He brakes, you pass.
You brake, he passes.

01:45:33.613 --> 01:45:35.213
Or no one brakes.

01:45:35.315 --> 01:45:37.816
What's going on here?
- You need new rubber.

01:45:37.918 --> 01:45:39.548
I don't have time.
Check the pressures.

01:45:39.650 --> 01:45:42.047
Chiti, check the tires.
Nelson, did you check
the front offside?

01:45:42.149 --> 01:45:43.418
Yes. It's okay.

01:45:44.452 --> 01:45:45.956
We're wasting time, Ferrari.
Come on!

01:45:46.058 --> 01:45:47.453
Chiti,
check the front offside.

01:45:47.556 --> 01:45:49.159
- Come on, they're good.
-  Chiti!

01:45:49.261 --> 01:45:51.525
They're worn.
Will it get us to Brescia?

01:45:52.391 --> 01:45:54.033
Will it get us to Brescia?

01:45:58.099 --> 01:45:59.764
Go, go! Hurry up!

01:46:09.513 --> 01:46:13.210
Eh, eh, Laura!
Signora! Laura, please?

01:46:13.312 --> 01:46:15.387
Laura, please. Please.

01:46:15.489 --> 01:46:16.547
Laura, please?

01:46:16.649 --> 01:46:19.586
Please, Laura.
Another one, please.
Laura!

01:46:19.688 --> 01:46:21.523
<i>To bring you the latest...</i>

01:46:21.625 --> 01:46:24.159
<i>...from the Mille Miglia,
I'm sure you are
as curious as I am</i>

01:46:24.261 --> 01:46:25.962
<i>to see who finished
in glory today.</i>

01:46:26.064 --> 01:46:27.693
<i>Let's hear from Signor Ferra--</i>

01:46:36.108 --> 01:46:37.436
<i>Signor Ferrari,
who's gonna win?</i>

01:46:37.538 --> 01:46:39.703
<i>It could be any
of the first five.</i>

01:46:39.806 --> 01:46:42.108
<i>And what about
Gendebien's 250?</i>

01:46:42.210 --> 01:46:47.086
<i>He demonstrates that even
the smallest Ferrari can compete
at the highest level.</i>

01:46:47.188 --> 01:46:49.054
<i>May he win?
Of course he may win!</i>

01:46:49.156 --> 01:46:51.486
<i>Who wants
to come in second?</i>

01:46:53.257 --> 01:46:55.253
You knew about her
and you never told me?

01:46:55.355 --> 01:46:57.426
He is entitled to an heir.

01:46:58.928 --> 01:47:00.627
I gave him one.

01:47:02.662 --> 01:47:06.303
As it turns out,
one was not enough.

01:47:14.541 --> 01:47:17.677
I gave him one!
I gave him one!

01:48:04.663 --> 01:48:06.058
Edoardo!

01:48:06.160 --> 01:48:07.628
Edoardo!

01:48:12.698 --> 01:48:15.306
Edoardo, go back,
wash your hands.

01:48:55.343 --> 01:48:56.743
They're coming!

01:48:57.879 --> 01:49:01.052
I think this guy is crazy
about these cars.

01:49:01.154 --> 01:49:03.354
He's only ever thinking
about cars.

01:51:03.206 --> 01:51:04.475
Peter, hi!

01:51:04.943 --> 01:51:06.106
Where is Fon?

01:51:06.208 --> 01:51:07.409
I don't know.

01:51:07.511 --> 01:51:10.074
He was behind me
until my car broke down.

01:51:11.083 --> 01:51:12.846
He'll be here somewhere.

01:51:47.583 --> 01:51:49.149
<i>Commendatore?</i>

01:51:50.788 --> 01:51:54.118
<i>Maresciallo,</i>
we are here to collect the car.

01:52:04.805 --> 01:52:06.200
De Portago?

01:52:06.302 --> 01:52:07.835
They took him away.

01:53:19.376 --> 01:53:21.007
Hello?
<i>Piero.</i>

01:53:21.575 --> 01:53:23.207
Yes.
<i>It's Enzo.</i>

01:53:23.909 --> 01:53:26.277
<i>I wanted to congratulate you.</i>

01:53:26.379 --> 01:53:27.883
Mmm.

01:53:27.985 --> 01:53:30.885
Well, what happened is separate
from your victory today.

01:53:32.084 --> 01:53:34.053
<i>It will go
into the history books.</i>

01:53:35.087 --> 01:53:37.661
<i>- Commendatore--</i>
- Good night, Piero.

01:53:38.395 --> 01:53:40.763
<i>And again, I salute you.</i>

01:53:48.408 --> 01:53:50.740
The police are on their way
from Rome.

01:53:51.506 --> 01:53:52.973
They want the car.

01:54:02.183 --> 01:54:05.655
I don't know.
No, I don't know when.
I'm sorry.

01:54:05.757 --> 01:54:07.922
I will tell him you called.

01:54:11.059 --> 01:54:13.125
The <i>Commendatore</i>
is not available.

01:54:15.434 --> 01:54:17.536
I'm sorry, he is really tied up.

01:54:39.554 --> 01:54:43.056
Signor Ferrari is not available
to answer your questions.

01:54:47.132 --> 01:54:48.226
<i>Commendatore.</i>

01:54:52.801 --> 01:54:55.403
This wheel hit a curb stone,
a brick.

01:54:55.505 --> 01:54:57.334
Something solid to cut it.

01:54:58.276 --> 01:54:59.677
It wasn't the tire.

01:55:15.721 --> 01:55:17.222
Lina called me.

01:55:19.597 --> 01:55:21.699
She wants me
to bring you there.

01:55:27.667 --> 01:55:29.201
What happened?

01:55:37.350 --> 01:55:39.343
We all know death
is nearby.

01:55:41.121 --> 01:55:42.687
No, no, no, no.

01:55:43.850 --> 01:55:45.987
No, children don't know.

01:55:47.491 --> 01:55:48.554
Families don't know.

01:55:52.359 --> 01:55:55.326
I have to talk
to those vultures.
Then drive me home?

01:55:56.069 --> 01:55:57.735
Tavoni! Tommaso!

01:56:01.602 --> 01:56:03.004
Enzo!

01:56:07.213 --> 01:56:08.878
She cashed the check.

01:56:22.455 --> 01:56:24.521
Why did you keep running drivers
on poor quality tires?

01:56:24.623 --> 01:56:27.861
Did you realize
that your negligence
cost the lives

01:56:27.963 --> 01:56:31.636
of nine people,
including five children?

01:56:31.738 --> 01:56:33.838
How do you plan to respond
to all the accusations?

01:56:33.940 --> 01:56:36.675
And how do you plan to justify
the number of casualties?

01:56:37.738 --> 01:56:40.011
Castelvetro?
No.

01:56:40.113 --> 01:56:42.080
Largo Garibaldi.

01:56:42.182 --> 01:56:43.910
Phone Lina for me.

01:56:44.012 --> 01:56:46.685
Tell her I'll call
maybe tomorrow.

01:56:47.285 --> 01:56:48.753
I have business.

01:57:07.272 --> 01:57:10.706
<i>Do you realize that your
negligence has cost the lives--</i>

01:57:10.808 --> 01:57:13.573
<i>Look, if Italy
is looking for a scapegoat,</i>

01:57:13.675 --> 01:57:14.839
<i>then here I am!</i>

01:57:22.253 --> 01:57:23.287
No lights?

01:57:23.389 --> 01:57:25.648
I have a headache.

01:57:26.284 --> 01:57:28.490
The phone's been ringing
all night.

01:57:28.592 --> 01:57:30.091
I took it off the hook.

01:57:32.290 --> 01:57:33.725
You're in real trouble,
you know.

01:57:33.827 --> 01:57:35.162
To do with the tires.

01:57:35.264 --> 01:57:38.633
The press is competing
for who can vilify you the most.

01:57:38.735 --> 01:57:40.571
Nothing wrong with the tires.

01:57:40.673 --> 01:57:42.941
He hit something.
Did you take any calls?

01:57:44.641 --> 01:57:46.238
Ugolini from <i>The Gazette.</i>

01:57:46.340 --> 01:57:49.209
What did you tell him?
I told him to fuck himself.

01:57:50.511 --> 01:57:54.016
Then that man from <i>Autosport.</i>
I told him to fuck himself.

01:57:54.748 --> 01:57:56.419
Then Agnelli.

01:57:56.521 --> 01:57:57.649
Agnelli?
I told him...

01:57:57.751 --> 01:57:59.318
to call back.

01:58:00.292 --> 01:58:01.718
Anyone else?

01:58:01.820 --> 01:58:03.052
Cuoghi.

01:58:03.154 --> 01:58:04.992
I told him
to fuck himself,

01:58:05.094 --> 01:58:07.194
then I took the phone
off the hook.
Great.

01:58:07.928 --> 01:58:09.600
Mama, what are you doing?

01:58:09.702 --> 01:58:11.064
I'm all packed.
When do we leave?

01:58:11.166 --> 01:58:13.871
We're not going anywhere.
Go back to sleep.

01:58:24.045 --> 01:58:26.444
This is God's way
of punishing us.

01:58:27.317 --> 01:58:28.753
Us?

01:58:28.855 --> 01:58:31.686
You think
he slaughtered nine people
at Guidizzolo

01:58:31.788 --> 01:58:33.517
to get even
with you and me?

01:58:35.793 --> 01:58:37.790
I got a message
from the bank.

01:58:37.892 --> 01:58:39.762
You cashed the check.
Mm.

01:58:39.864 --> 01:58:42.166
They're calling
insolvency experts.

01:58:42.268 --> 01:58:43.767
We're done.

01:58:43.869 --> 01:58:46.062
The bank
is getting hysterical
over nothing.

01:58:46.164 --> 01:58:48.238
Nothing?
You bankrupted us.

01:58:48.340 --> 01:58:49.232
Enzo, stop it.

01:58:49.334 --> 01:58:51.741
What good
are you doing yourself?

01:58:51.843 --> 01:58:54.371
Mm, "I'm a scapegoat,
I'm a martyr."

01:58:54.474 --> 01:58:57.376
Who are you?
Who have you become?
St. Sebastian?

01:58:57.478 --> 01:59:00.280
You stand there
and let them shoot arrows
in your ass?

01:59:03.622 --> 01:59:05.786
Go beat the hell
out of them.

01:59:05.888 --> 01:59:08.788
The writers.
Those cheap hacks.

01:59:08.890 --> 01:59:10.895
Threaten them.
Extort them.

01:59:11.861 --> 01:59:13.763
And those
still on their feet,

01:59:13.865 --> 01:59:16.699
the most sanctimonious
and hypocritical,

01:59:16.801 --> 01:59:19.563
those, you give them
brown envelopes.

01:59:21.839 --> 01:59:24.439
And then they also
will discover

01:59:24.541 --> 01:59:28.371
that, "Perhaps
the Sage of Maranello
has been maligned unfairly.

01:59:28.473 --> 01:59:31.582
Perhaps moderation
should reassert itself

01:59:31.684 --> 01:59:34.149
in the distinguished
Italian press."

01:59:35.754 --> 01:59:37.515
And for that,
you need the cash.

01:59:51.300 --> 01:59:54.269
You thought I'd pack
a suitcase and go, right?

01:59:54.671 --> 01:59:56.171
It crossed my mind.

01:59:57.873 --> 01:59:59.603
It crossed my mind too.

02:00:01.778 --> 02:00:02.906
You're financing this?

02:00:03.008 --> 02:00:05.213
No, lending it.

02:00:07.883 --> 02:00:09.481
And the conditions are?

02:00:15.460 --> 02:00:17.258
No conditions.

02:00:18.428 --> 02:00:19.997
Oh.

02:00:20.630 --> 02:00:22.164
No conditions.

02:00:25.672 --> 02:00:27.631
There was a part of you
in Dino.

02:00:28.870 --> 02:00:31.943
Your warmth. Your wit.

02:00:32.938 --> 02:00:34.407
Your joy.

02:00:35.007 --> 02:00:36.508
He had that.

02:00:38.345 --> 02:00:41.315
I had that from you
in our early years.

02:00:42.620 --> 02:00:44.488
But after a time,

02:00:45.557 --> 02:00:49.521
I only got what was left
when you came home from
the fights in the factory.

02:00:51.225 --> 02:00:53.957
The ambition,
the drive, the plots.

02:00:54.059 --> 02:00:55.659
The paranoia.

02:00:57.437 --> 02:00:58.899
Even our fucking.

02:00:59.001 --> 02:01:00.972
As if that could save Dino.

02:01:05.372 --> 02:01:08.705
What I loved in you
I also found in him.

02:01:15.114 --> 02:01:16.680
All that's gone.

02:01:24.325 --> 02:01:26.494
There is no condition.
You have the money.

02:01:30.965 --> 02:01:33.004
But it is my wish...

02:01:35.003 --> 02:01:37.641
for my grief for our son,

02:01:37.743 --> 02:01:40.110
for the years
building this...

02:01:42.679 --> 02:01:48.580
you do not acknowledge
the boy with the name Ferrari
while I am alive.

02:02:55.280 --> 02:02:57.088
How'd you get here?

02:02:58.186 --> 02:02:59.620
I came with Giuseppe.

02:02:59.722 --> 02:03:01.587
Giuseppe?

02:03:04.824 --> 02:03:07.725
Your mother sent him
because she wants me
to come home.

02:03:14.006 --> 02:03:16.140
You haven't been here
before, have you?

02:03:16.606 --> 02:03:17.801
No.

02:03:20.371 --> 02:03:21.773
Do you know something?

02:03:21.875 --> 02:03:23.081
Hmm?

02:03:23.616 --> 02:03:25.344
Your mother and you

02:03:25.446 --> 02:03:27.614
are going to come
live with me in Modena.

02:03:27.716 --> 02:03:29.015
Papa.

02:03:29.117 --> 02:03:30.849
Is the TV reception better?

02:03:33.055 --> 02:03:34.958
Much better.

02:03:35.060 --> 02:03:36.586
You can see the tower
from my window.

02:03:36.688 --> 02:03:39.097
Did you get
de Portago's autograph?

02:03:41.798 --> 02:03:43.365
I did.

02:03:45.734 --> 02:03:46.797
Come.

02:03:51.571 --> 02:03:54.112
I'll introduce you
to your brother Dino.

02:03:55.178 --> 02:03:57.313
I wish you could
have known him.

02:03:59.349 --> 02:04:01.713
He would have taken you
with him everywhere.
