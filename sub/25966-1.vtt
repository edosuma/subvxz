A FILM BY EGOR BARANOV

00:32.290 --> 00:35.166
Devised by
ALEXANDER TSEKALO

00:37.291 --> 00:38.874
Are you there, my sweet?

00:42.207 --> 00:45.166
Written by
NATALYA MERKULOVA, ALEXEY CHUPOV

00:46.791 --> 00:48.749
Wait, don't let Father see us!

00:48.957 --> 00:50.999
Why worry about that old fool?

00:51.207 --> 00:52.916
I will marry you regardless.

00:53.707 --> 00:55.291
Fate is harsh to us.

00:55.499 --> 00:59.249
Father shall soon leave for Mirgorod
to find me a rich husband.

00:59.791 --> 01:02.624
Does he want to feel
the force of my fist?

01:02.832 --> 01:04.666
I will let no-one have you.

01:06.041 --> 01:08.041
I'd sooner die than marry another.

01:10.916 --> 01:13.166
Father's looking for you, Bogdana.

01:13.374 --> 01:14.666
Don't get caught.

01:15.707 --> 01:17.624
Where are you headed, Darinka?

01:17.832 --> 01:21.416
I'm going to the fields
to bring Fyodor his supper.

01:21.624 --> 01:23.749
Don't stay out too late, sister.

01:23.957 --> 01:25.166
I'll try my best.

01:25.624 --> 01:26.707
You'd better!

01:26.916 --> 01:28.499
Oh, who's talking!

01:28.707 --> 01:29.916
Bogdana!

01:30.124 --> 01:32.416
- Where the hell are you?
- I must run.

01:35.041 --> 01:37.374
Who's that looking for trouble?

01:37.582 --> 01:41.166
I'll show him trouble, the scoundrel!

01:43.166 --> 01:44.749
Like flies to a honeypot.

02:06.499 --> 02:07.457
FYOdor!

02:15.249 --> 02:17.249
I've brought you supper.

02:18.416 --> 02:19.457
Thank you.

02:21.582 --> 02:23.666
May I sit with you a while?

02:30.207 --> 02:34.124
BASED ON THE WORKS OF NIKOLAI GOGOL

02:36.624 --> 02:40.832
Fyodor, when I am 17,
will you ask my hand in marriage?

02:42.332 --> 02:43.999
You surprise me, Darinka.

02:45.291 --> 02:47.249
Who needs such an ugly husband?

02:48.999 --> 02:50.124
I do.

02:56.416 --> 02:58.082
Will you kiss me, Fyodor?

03:00.832 --> 03:02.374
Hey, where are you going?

03:03.916 --> 03:05.749
Stop. Hey!

03:06.416 --> 03:08.166
Stop!

03:10.457 --> 03:12.249
Fyodor, wait. I'll come too!

03:13.916 --> 03:14.916
Stop!

03:15.499 --> 03:16.666
Stop there!

03:20.541 --> 03:21.999
Where did it go?

03:27.166 --> 03:28.124
PI

04:02.207 --> 04:05.791
CHAPTER 3:
A BEWITCHED PLACE

04:29.207 --> 04:30.249
Maybe you should.

04:54.457 --> 04:55.541
What's all this?

04:55.749 --> 04:58.874
I'd think a person
of Mr. Guro's stature

04:59.082 --> 05:01.541
would hide away something of interest.

05:02.207 --> 05:03.624
All I see are papers.

05:03.832 --> 05:07.291
These papers may
shed light on the investigation.

05:07.499 --> 05:09.041
6 AUG, 9 SEP
22 SEP, 2 OCT

05:11.291 --> 05:14.166
Paraska's ears are small here.

05:14.707 --> 05:17.374
Her ears were bigger than that.

05:19.624 --> 05:23.082
What do you
think this means, Mr. Gogol?

05:24.832 --> 05:26.499
"Twelve plus one..."

05:27.874 --> 05:30.332
Perhaps there's
some kind of system.

05:30.791 --> 05:34.916
Look, here are the four dates
when the horseman killed,

05:35.124 --> 05:36.457
and one more date:

05:37.207 --> 05:38.874
October 2.

05:39.332 --> 05:42.291
October 2
is the day after tomorrow.

05:43.916 --> 05:48.749
Guro died before Paraska,
but identified the date of her murder.

05:48.957 --> 05:51.082
So, judging by his calculations,

05:51.291 --> 05:55.791
the next murder
should take place on October 2.

05:58.166 --> 05:59.582
Why that date?

06:00.374 --> 06:03.791
October 2 is
the feast of the Intercession.

06:07.166 --> 06:10.791
CASE FILE: NIKOLAI GOGOL
CONFIDENTIAL

06:15.916 --> 06:19.416
I had a calendar here somewhere.
One moment...

06:24.416 --> 06:25.666
A holy feast...

06:26.749 --> 06:30.624
So, the first murder
took place on July 20.

06:32.457 --> 06:35.624
July 20 - the feast of St. Elijah.

06:35.832 --> 06:37.666
Then August 6...

06:38.499 --> 06:42.291
August 6 - Apple Feast Day.

06:42.499 --> 06:47.082
September 9 - the Harvest Festival.

06:47.999 --> 06:52.082
September 22 - the Autumn Equinox.

06:53.499 --> 06:55.249
Feast days abound.

06:56.582 --> 06:58.416
Perhaps that is the system.

06:58.999 --> 07:02.916
The horseman
murders girls on feast days.

07:03.374 --> 07:07.957
Mother always said to
be on your guard on feast days,

07:08.541 --> 07:10.041
evil spirits rage,

07:10.249 --> 07:12.666
their strength increases tenfold.

07:13.582 --> 07:14.749
It all fits.

07:15.457 --> 07:18.666
Four feast days, four murders.

07:18.874 --> 07:21.749
There are 9 more this year,
for a total of 13.

07:21.957 --> 07:24.916
So Guro believed there
would be 13 victims.

07:25.124 --> 07:28.832
And that they would
be killed on feast days.

07:29.041 --> 07:30.332
Remarkable.

07:30.541 --> 07:35.166
This means we may determine
when the next killings will occur?

07:35.624 --> 07:36.916
It would seem so.

08:28.957 --> 08:31.832
Rest, O Lord,
the soul of Thy servant...

08:32.041 --> 08:33.541
Father Bartholomew!

08:35.124 --> 08:36.999
- Woe is upon us!
- What is it?

08:37.207 --> 08:38.541
Basavryuk is here.

08:38.749 --> 08:41.832
Again? That man of sin.

08:42.457 --> 08:45.999
O Lord Jesus,
may the devil burn his mustache.

08:47.666 --> 08:48.957
My condolences.

08:49.457 --> 08:50.416
I am sorry.

08:51.124 --> 08:52.707
Forgive me, O Lord.

08:59.582 --> 09:02.541
- Hey, lady!
- How may I help?

09:03.624 --> 09:06.416
- Who are you?
- Christina.

09:07.457 --> 09:08.499
Where's Hanna?

09:08.707 --> 09:11.124
Oh, your Hanna is dead.
Now it's me.

09:12.666 --> 09:15.291
I'll be damned.
I come for a pretty maid...

09:16.124 --> 09:18.541
and get someone old and grayed!

09:20.207 --> 09:24.041
Mr. Binkh,
he is devising such wicked deeds.

09:24.249 --> 09:27.291
Perhaps, God willing,
you could, as you say...

09:28.207 --> 09:30.249
isolate him?

09:31.957 --> 09:34.332
And why should I isolate him?

09:34.541 --> 09:36.499
It is clear he is a demon!

09:36.707 --> 09:40.541
His face is all dark
and wrinkled like an empty pouch.

09:41.207 --> 09:43.082
And why should I detain him?

09:43.291 --> 09:46.499
Because you dislike his face?
Look at your own.

09:46.707 --> 09:49.999
We cannot allow
his dog-like snout

09:50.624 --> 09:52.874
to touch Christian souls.

09:53.082 --> 09:55.499
Right, for the last time,

09:55.707 --> 09:59.582
we do not arrest people
for having dog-like faces,

09:59.791 --> 10:01.249
or throw them in jail.

10:01.457 --> 10:02.749
We have laws.

10:04.207 --> 10:05.249
This is Russia.

10:15.707 --> 10:19.374
Sir, a young man and
a maiden wish to see you.

10:21.749 --> 10:22.707
Come in.

10:33.791 --> 10:34.749
What brings you?

10:34.957 --> 10:37.707
My younger sister Darinka is missing.

10:37.916 --> 10:41.166
She brought Fyodor supper
in the fields, then vanished.

10:41.832 --> 10:45.916
- Help us, for mercy's sake.
- You're from the capital, after all.

10:55.416 --> 10:58.582
I am sure your sister is alive.

10:59.041 --> 11:00.249
But...

11:01.624 --> 11:03.791
we have little time to waste.

11:03.999 --> 11:08.582
Let me be of service.
I can put together a search party.

11:08.791 --> 11:12.582
- Let me speak to him...
- I'll do it myself!

11:13.916 --> 11:16.874
I see I was light
on the whip, you little wretch!

11:17.082 --> 11:20.416
Do not come within
a gunshot of her. Am I clear?

11:20.624 --> 11:23.499
I am a free Cossack,
I'll do as I wish.

11:24.832 --> 11:28.624
I will never give Bogdana
to a low-life such as you.

11:29.957 --> 11:33.624
And I keep my word.
It may as well be written in stone!

11:33.832 --> 11:36.749
Please, Father, leave him!
Petro's helping us.

11:36.957 --> 11:39.624
Mr. Gogol can confirm.

11:42.041 --> 11:43.124
Good Lord.

11:44.124 --> 11:47.666
I'll pay any price for Darinka.
Just find my daughter.

11:47.874 --> 11:50.916
I will do everything in my power.

11:51.124 --> 11:53.166
If I may help, just say.

11:54.541 --> 11:55.666
Very well.

11:57.041 --> 11:58.041
You see?

11:59.249 --> 12:02.207
There are serious people on the case.

12:02.666 --> 12:05.707
Now get back home immediately!

12:08.791 --> 12:10.041
Learn some manners!

12:15.416 --> 12:18.916
He is like a bear, sir.
I couldn't stop him.

12:19.832 --> 12:20.916
MY apologies.

12:31.291 --> 12:32.249
Lisa.

12:47.707 --> 12:48.749
Lisa.

12:49.207 --> 12:50.291
Mr. Gogol.

12:52.707 --> 12:55.832
I do not know where to start, but...

12:59.249 --> 13:00.999
I feel I'm losing my mind.

13:12.666 --> 13:16.249
Leave Nikolai, he's mine.
He's my destiny.

13:17.082 --> 13:20.291
Back off,
or you will regret it.

13:26.499 --> 13:28.166
Who was that girl, Nikolai?

13:29.624 --> 13:32.291
She's... not real, is she?

13:33.041 --> 13:34.791
But she talked to me, and...

13:34.999 --> 13:37.999
I don't understand,
I really am losing my mind.

13:40.624 --> 13:41.624
Lisa...

13:43.957 --> 13:46.666
You see, this girl...

13:48.707 --> 13:49.832
exists.

13:50.916 --> 13:55.207
But at the same time, not quite.

13:56.874 --> 13:57.957
I don't understand.

13:58.832 --> 13:59.791
Do you know her?

14:01.666 --> 14:02.666
Yes.

14:03.916 --> 14:05.791
She is the drowned girl.

14:05.999 --> 14:08.791
Sometimes she appears before me...

14:10.207 --> 14:11.249
as a ghost.

14:12.666 --> 14:14.499
- A ghost?
- Yes.

14:18.666 --> 14:21.249
Why did your ghost appear before me?

14:22.791 --> 14:23.791
I do not know.

14:28.041 --> 14:32.874
You have passed your visions onto me,
and we are both going crazy.

14:33.082 --> 14:35.041
It's the only explanation.

14:38.832 --> 14:40.249
Your ghost is...

14:41.666 --> 14:42.749
very beautiful.

14:52.791 --> 14:53.749
Beast...

14:54.957 --> 14:56.041
Beast...

14:57.124 --> 14:58.707
115E1-

14:58.916 --> 15:01.249
115E1-

15:01.457 --> 15:03.874
- Where's the girl?
- Beast, beast...

15:04.082 --> 15:06.332
- Is she alive?
- Beast...

15:06.541 --> 15:08.874
Why are you bloody?
You're not injured.

15:09.082 --> 15:10.207
111$:

15:10.207 --> 15:13.666
Perhaps some animal
attacked him and Darinka.

15:13.874 --> 15:16.624
I think this bastard
is referring to himself.

15:16.791 --> 15:17.666
111$:

15:17.832 --> 15:19.582
Answer me - what was this beast?

15:19.791 --> 15:22.666
Mr. Binkh, surely you see
he cannot speak!

15:22.874 --> 15:24.582
Look at the state he's in!

15:27.457 --> 15:31.249
So you have a better idea?
Pray tell.

15:32.957 --> 15:36.374
We need to search
the forest for the girl.

15:36.582 --> 15:40.374
So you think every time a
peasant girl goes missing,

15:40.582 --> 15:43.541
I should send out
my entire Cossack squad?

15:43.749 --> 15:47.541
You have the entire
village at your disposal. Just ask!

15:59.457 --> 16:01.041
Where are you, sister?

16:05.832 --> 16:08.707
Darina! Daughter!

16:08.916 --> 16:10.749
Where are you, sister?

16:37.582 --> 16:39.082
Not me you're looking for?

16:40.124 --> 16:41.374
Why are you here?

16:42.999 --> 16:44.541
Do not be angry.

16:45.124 --> 16:47.791
You asked to be taught
to control your gift.

16:48.749 --> 16:50.082
So here I am.

16:54.249 --> 16:55.291
So then...

16:55.874 --> 16:56.916
Shall we start?

16:58.291 --> 16:59.957
Why did you visit Lisa?

17:00.874 --> 17:03.374
I forbid you from bothering her again.

17:03.582 --> 17:04.665
Am I being clear?

17:09.457 --> 17:11.290
I see I'm not right for you.

17:11.499 --> 17:14.165
Boys once chased me in their droves.

17:14.374 --> 17:16.040
Am I really no longer pretty?

17:16.582 --> 17:18.040
That's not what I meant.

17:20.165 --> 17:21.124
Of course.

17:22.165 --> 17:25.290
I do not wear
elegant dresses like your Lisa.

17:26.165 --> 17:28.124
I'm just a water nymph.

17:31.499 --> 17:34.499
Farewell.
I shall no longer visit her, or you.

17:34.707 --> 17:36.916
Master your gift without me.

17:37.999 --> 17:40.749
All I want is for you
to stay away from her!

17:40.957 --> 17:43.624
- I...
- Don't visit my pond again.

17:44.624 --> 17:47.749
- Or I'll drown you.
- You got the wrong idea!

17:48.374 --> 17:49.332
II]

17:50.374 --> 17:51.666
Mr. Gogol...

17:52.916 --> 17:54.041
Are you well?

17:55.749 --> 17:58.124
Yes, yes, I'm fine.

17:59.499 --> 18:00.832
HEY, everyone!

18:11.207 --> 18:13.832
God rest her innocent soul.

18:14.041 --> 18:15.249
If I'

18:15.457 --> 18:16.457
lfl'

18:17.291 --> 18:18.791
No, Father!

18:20.332 --> 18:21.707
Stay away from her!

18:22.666 --> 18:24.416
I'll kill you, you beggar!

18:32.707 --> 18:36.124
Why today? The feast
is the day after tomorrow.

18:36.332 --> 18:39.499
Could Guro's predictions
have been mistaken?

18:39.707 --> 18:43.291
And my theory about feast days

18:43.749 --> 18:45.874
has proven to be wrong.

18:46.082 --> 18:49.166
To err is human,
as the ancients said.

18:57.832 --> 19:00.249
Well, that clears everything up.

19:00.832 --> 19:05.457
Darinka was brutally murdered.
This is proof of Fyodor's guilt.

19:05.666 --> 19:08.582
I would not rush
to conclusions, Mr. Binkh.

19:08.791 --> 19:12.582
Doctor, has alcohol blinded you?
I see blood, entrails.

19:12.791 --> 19:14.416
What else do you require?

19:14.624 --> 19:17.624
This is not human blood.

19:17.832 --> 19:18.999
This is not Darinka.

19:20.832 --> 19:22.999
It's Ovis aries.

19:23.791 --> 19:25.124
What the devil is that?

19:25.624 --> 19:27.749
The domestic sheep.

19:28.332 --> 19:30.041
As you see, Mr. Binkh,

19:30.249 --> 19:34.749
I can still tell human entrails
from those of a sheep.

19:35.957 --> 19:37.666
What are you saying, then?

19:37.874 --> 19:40.749
Someone came here
and butchered a sheep.

19:42.166 --> 19:46.582
You do indeed know a sheep's guts
better than a human's.

19:47.166 --> 19:49.082
You should switch to livestock.

19:50.582 --> 19:52.332
You, sir, are a churlish fool.

19:54.791 --> 19:56.082
Give me some water.

19:58.332 --> 19:59.791
You are unfair.

20:00.332 --> 20:03.249
Dr. Bomgart is a master of his trade.

20:04.041 --> 20:06.416
A master? I'll say.

20:07.124 --> 20:09.416
A master of gutting corpses.

20:10.374 --> 20:12.416
He cannot operate on the living.

20:12.624 --> 20:15.166
He fainted sooner
than pulling my tooth.

20:15.707 --> 20:16.999
Had to go to Mirgorod.

20:38.916 --> 20:41.791
It's the horseman!
He did all this.

20:41.999 --> 20:43.249
Darinka's alive.

20:44.707 --> 20:49.457
He wants to kill her on
the night of the Intercession.

21:04.457 --> 21:07.874
That was quite a day, Mr. Gogol.
Anyway...

21:08.707 --> 21:10.041
it's getting late.

21:10.791 --> 21:12.041
I shall go home.

21:15.207 --> 21:18.082
Dr. Bomgart, why can't you
operate on the living?

21:21.374 --> 21:24.582
Is that churl
already telling tales about me?

21:31.166 --> 21:33.582
Once in St. Petersburg,
I operated...

21:34.624 --> 21:35.791
on a child.

21:35.999 --> 21:39.291
The operation failed,
and the child died.

21:40.957 --> 21:42.874
I stopped operating after that.

21:43.082 --> 21:45.916
I want no other person
to die under my knife.

21:47.291 --> 21:49.166
Did that satisfy your curiosity?

21:52.374 --> 21:53.457
You...

21:55.082 --> 21:56.249
are a good doctor.

21:58.124 --> 22:00.041
You should not bury your talent.

22:00.707 --> 22:01.707
Yes...

22:03.416 --> 22:04.416
Yes.

22:19.457 --> 22:21.291
CASE FILE: NIKOLAI GOGOL

22:31.082 --> 22:36.916
Nikolai Vasilyevich Gogol:
Born in Poltava Province in 180.9.

22:37.124 --> 22:40.207
One of six brothers,
two of which died in childbirth.

22:40.416 --> 22:42.041
Three died in infancy,

22:42.249 --> 22:47.207
and only Gogol,
the most sickly child, remained alive.

22:49.332 --> 22:51.166
"The mystery of birth".

22:52.291 --> 22:53.249
"A dark one?"

23:02.832 --> 23:04.666
You can enter this world.

23:06.374 --> 23:07.374
It is your gift.

24:03.999 --> 24:06.082
The blood of innocents,

24:06.582 --> 24:08.666
by the hand of innocents,

24:09.124 --> 24:10.749
the den of the beast.

24:11.416 --> 24:13.624
Autumn flower.

24:15.624 --> 24:17.291
The blood of innocents,

24:18.207 --> 24:20.082
by the hand of innocents,

24:20.749 --> 24:22.374
the den of the beast.

24:22.999 --> 24:25.082
Autumn flower.

24:50.416 --> 24:51.707
Autumn flower!

25:09.791 --> 25:11.082
II]

25:24.624 --> 25:25.791
II]

25:33.124 --> 25:34.582
II]

26:22.791 --> 26:24.499
You're a fool to return.

26:24.707 --> 26:26.249
I said I would drown you!

26:26.582 --> 26:28.707
I cannot do it without your help.

26:32.082 --> 26:33.291
I don't know...

26:33.749 --> 26:36.249
How could a simple
water nymph be of use?

26:36.457 --> 26:39.166
Do you know anything
of the autumn flower?

26:41.457 --> 26:42.791
Why do you need it?

26:43.332 --> 26:45.374
I don't yet understand.

26:47.041 --> 26:48.332
It's the blood flower.

26:50.416 --> 26:52.041
It blooms once a year,

26:52.624 --> 26:54.916
under the moon
on Intercession Night,

26:55.124 --> 26:57.374
where gold is buried.

26:57.582 --> 27:00.082
Its petals are the color
of innocent blood.

27:00.624 --> 27:03.374
Only an innocent
can pick this flower,

27:03.999 --> 27:07.874
and uncover its hoard of gold.

27:09.291 --> 27:10.624
You are quick.

27:11.457 --> 27:14.041
But to obtain
this gold from the earth,

27:14.249 --> 27:17.374
the innocent must
spill another innocent's blood.

27:19.291 --> 27:21.582
This flower is better forgotten.

27:22.874 --> 27:24.374
How did you learn of it?

27:24.957 --> 27:28.541
I do not know.
I see it in dreams and visions,

27:28.749 --> 27:31.541
but I cannot explain it.

27:31.749 --> 27:32.749
It is beyond me.

27:34.541 --> 27:35.749
Teach me.

27:38.291 --> 27:41.291
What do I get for it?
What is my reward?

27:45.291 --> 27:46.541
Kiss me first.

27:52.291 --> 27:53.749
What? Is it Lisa?

27:53.957 --> 27:56.374
Then get Lisa to teach you!

27:57.457 --> 28:01.332
There can be nothing between us,
she is married.

28:01.541 --> 28:03.457
Then why will you not kiss me?

28:26.666 --> 28:29.291
Your gift is innate.

28:30.749 --> 28:32.666
It accompanies you as fate.

28:33.124 --> 28:35.999
You were not simply born,
you were chosen.

28:36.457 --> 28:40.666
He answer is in your past -
your childhood.

28:41.249 --> 28:43.666
- Are you ready?
- For what?

29:08.916 --> 29:11.041
I couldn't save his five brothers.

29:11.249 --> 29:13.707
It is some kind of curse,
I was powerless.

29:14.707 --> 29:20.124
It is God's will. He decides
who survives and who does not.

29:20.332 --> 29:23.541
- Your task is to treat our son.
- Mama...

29:41.332 --> 29:42.499
Lisa?

29:55.832 --> 29:57.249
Maybe you're my destiny?

30:15.624 --> 30:17.582
I ask only one thing of you:

30:17.791 --> 30:20.916
pick the blood flower,
and the gold is ours.

30:22.957 --> 30:24.249
If you comply,

30:24.457 --> 30:27.749
you'll live like a pig in clover
until your dying day.

30:28.332 --> 30:30.791
So, is it a deal?

30:41.582 --> 30:47.374
Basavryuk is no mere demon,
he is a hunter of souls.

30:47.582 --> 30:49.791
What do you mean,
"a hunter of souls"?

30:50.249 --> 30:54.291
He gets men drunk,
gives necklaces to maidens.

30:54.749 --> 30:59.499
They hang on his every word,
and he corrupts their souls.

31:00.332 --> 31:05.041
And the people are too afraid
to bring justice upon him?

31:05.249 --> 31:09.707
This damned demon
has struck into us such fear

31:09.916 --> 31:11.916
that it is shameful to admit.

31:12.374 --> 31:16.916
Last year, I wanted to follow him,
but he saw me.

31:17.124 --> 31:18.999
I barely got away.

31:19.207 --> 31:21.499
He was going to Bear Creek.

31:21.707 --> 31:26.666
It is rumored that he corrupts
souls in that cursed place.

31:27.374 --> 31:30.041
Nobody can find
a single trace of proof.

31:30.791 --> 31:33.499
That son of Satan
can cover his tracks.

31:36.999 --> 31:39.166
Tell me, Father,

31:40.166 --> 31:42.874
does Lisa Danishevskaya
often come here?

31:47.082 --> 31:48.124
All the time.

31:48.916 --> 31:53.916
A beautifully pure soul.
She prays ardently, as if for two.

31:55.624 --> 31:58.166
It must be for
the sins of her husband.

31:58.374 --> 32:00.624
What are his sins?

32:01.291 --> 32:03.874
Only she and God know.

32:04.082 --> 32:08.666
But I am sure he lives in sin.
I have never seen him in church.

32:21.207 --> 32:23.666
Thank you, I will go.

32:24.832 --> 32:26.166
I won't disturb her.

32:38.832 --> 32:40.916
He was going to Bear Creek.

32:42.124 --> 32:44.332
The blood flower blooms once a year,

32:44.541 --> 32:46.832
under the moon
on Intercession Night;

32:47.041 --> 32:48.541
REFER

32:48.749 --> 32:50.707
The den of the beast.

32:51.916 --> 32:53.291
Bear Creek.

32:54.332 --> 32:55.707
Mr- Gogol?

32:55.916 --> 32:58.791
Lisa, do you know of Bear Creek?

32:59.957 --> 33:01.291
Why do you ask?

33:01.957 --> 33:04.291
Just tell me. It's very important.

33:07.666 --> 33:11.291
It's in the north of the forest,
near the lake, but...

33:12.082 --> 33:13.291
nobody goes there.

33:13.499 --> 33:16.124
The locals say evil lurks there.

33:16.749 --> 33:19.374
But I think it's mere superstition.

33:20.499 --> 33:22.916
Forgive me, I must hurry.

33:23.374 --> 33:26.416
Mr. Gogol, do you plan
to go to Bear's Creek?

33:26.624 --> 33:28.582
You must not.
It may be dangerous.

33:47.082 --> 33:48.207
I must go.

34:03.124 --> 34:07.082
Granny Komarikha
was telling stories about you.

34:07.291 --> 34:12.331
She said when you were young,
you met a real demon.

34:12.791 --> 34:15.041
Oh, don't listen to that old lady!

34:15.791 --> 34:16.791
Now go to sleep.

34:16.998 --> 34:22.166
Don't talk of demons at night,
or they will take you away. Sleep.

34:23.956 --> 34:25.416
VERDE-TI

34:26.998 --> 34:28.123
Vakula...

34:28.581 --> 34:30.873
Can you take me to Bear Creek?

34:31.331 --> 34:35.791
I won't go there.
And I'd advise you the same.

34:35.998 --> 34:37.748
Then tell me where it is.

34:37.956 --> 34:41.916
And do you have
any sort of... weapon?

34:42.498 --> 34:45.706
Just to frighten off animals.
I am afraid to go alone.

35:10.041 --> 35:13.791
It's an old custom: you burn
a sheet on Intercession Night,

35:13.999 --> 35:15.457
and you will be married.

35:15.666 --> 35:17.541
We're still too young, though.

35:26.916 --> 35:28.416
Maybe you're my destiny?

35:45.457 --> 35:47.666
The moon will soon come out,

35:47.874 --> 35:49.832
and the blood flower will rise.

35:58.332 --> 35:59.541
Take it.

36:19.749 --> 36:22.166
Look at all this gold.

36:22.832 --> 36:24.916
It will soon be ours.

36:35.249 --> 36:39.999
To take the gold from the water,
you must do one small thing.

36:46.707 --> 36:49.166
Sprinkle the
earth with her blood.

36:55.666 --> 36:59.082
You will be rich,
and Bogdana will be yours.

36:59.541 --> 37:04.249
Just kill her sister.
Hurry, Petro.

37:05.332 --> 37:06.916
The moon is going.

37:07.749 --> 37:09.832
The gold is disappearing.

37:32.874 --> 37:34.374
I will not be forgiven.

37:35.707 --> 37:36.999
I will burn in hell.

37:38.666 --> 37:40.457
Such is the fate of a Cossack.

37:41.791 --> 37:43.374
Don't touch her! Stop!

37:44.666 --> 37:45.666
Drop the dagger!

37:45.874 --> 37:47.041
Don't listen!

37:47.249 --> 37:49.874
If the gold goes, you lose Bogdana.

37:50.082 --> 37:52.791
He's a demon!
It's not gold he wants.

37:52.999 --> 37:55.416
He wants your soul!

37:55.624 --> 37:57.541
Kill her, and Bogdana is yours.

37:57.749 --> 37:58.916
Don't believe him!

37:59.124 --> 38:01.666
Bogdana will never love a murderer.

38:01.874 --> 38:03.624
She will never know.

38:04.082 --> 38:05.541
Look, Petro...

38:05.999 --> 38:07.499
the gold is disappearing.

38:09.041 --> 38:10.249
Petro, don't do it!

38:10.457 --> 38:12.749
Please, I beg you!

38:39.249 --> 38:40.291
The beast.

38:40.499 --> 38:45.499
The Blood Flower did bloom,
taking two to their doom!

39:23.874 --> 39:25.207
What happened to her?

39:27.749 --> 39:30.249
Get away from here! Go!

39:30.707 --> 39:31.999
Where's the doctor?

39:34.374 --> 39:35.582
Doctor...

39:37.582 --> 39:38.707
can you save her?

39:38.916 --> 39:42.666
She'll die during surgery,
I cannot accept the burden.

39:42.874 --> 39:45.957
Who should live,
and who should die...

39:46.916 --> 39:50.416
is for God to decide, not you.
Is that clear?

39:50.624 --> 39:54.416
I am the only
survivor of six brothers.

39:55.124 --> 39:57.291
That was His will.

39:57.499 --> 39:59.791
And this will be His decision.

39:59.999 --> 40:03.374
You just do what you know best.

40:03.582 --> 40:05.374
You're a talented doctor.

40:05.582 --> 40:08.499
I do not know my calling in life,

40:09.874 --> 40:13.166
but you were born for this purpose.

40:19.374 --> 40:20.916
I will need an assistant.

40:22.457 --> 40:24.374
I'm at your service.

40:36.957 --> 40:38.291
Hush, daughter!

40:38.499 --> 40:42.457
It was your fault he went there!
It was all your greed!

40:42.666 --> 40:45.041
And Darinka's death
will also be on you!

41:16.416 --> 41:17.582
She isn't breathing.

41:19.374 --> 41:22.166
Was this His decision?

41:36.457 --> 41:37.582
Yes.

41:38.291 --> 41:40.291
This was His decision.

41:52.541 --> 41:54.541
One thing troubles me.

41:55.207 --> 41:57.291
It was not Darinka in my visions,

41:58.707 --> 42:01.749
but some girl whom I don't recognize.

42:04.499 --> 42:08.749
Maybe you did see her before,
and your mind is playing tricks on you.

42:09.124 --> 42:10.124
Perhaps.

42:11.041 --> 42:13.332
Crucially, all the girls are alive.

42:13.541 --> 42:17.124
The horseman
has not killed on this night.

42:17.957 --> 42:20.249
It means my system must be wrong.

42:35.207 --> 42:36.207
Lisa.

42:38.707 --> 42:39.832
Why are you here?

42:41.791 --> 42:44.499
Alexey is away
until the morning, and...

42:45.791 --> 42:48.332
I could not rest
not knowing how you were.

42:48.916 --> 42:52.624
Had you not returned,
I would have never forgiven myself.

42:54.624 --> 42:58.082
What of the girl,
did you manage to save her?

42:58.291 --> 43:00.416
Yes. All is well, she is alive.

43:01.207 --> 43:05.207
You risked your life.
Don't do that again.

43:06.916 --> 43:09.541
I must go now.

43:13.457 --> 43:14.666
Mr. Gogol...

43:18.457 --> 43:22.916
I know it is wrong,
but I must say it.

43:25.957 --> 43:27.124
I love you.

43:29.332 --> 43:30.374
I love you too.

44:09.791 --> 44:10.874
Such a PitY-

44:11.666 --> 44:14.374
She was a good girl.
Bazhana was her name.

44:18.332 --> 44:20.166
Maybe you're my destiny?

44:21.416 --> 44:26.041
"The Blood Flower did bloom,
taking two to their doom."

44:27.999 --> 44:28.957
LBJ] PET-iii

44:32.499 --> 44:33.499
Nothing.

44:34.707 --> 44:36.791
This at least confirms your theory.

44:37.166 --> 44:39.499
The horseman does kill on feast days.

44:41.332 --> 44:42.916
When is the next one?

44:45.457 --> 44:49.291
In five days. Mokos Friday.

44:51.374 --> 44:54.874
We will no longer bend to his will.

44:55.457 --> 44:56.749
What do you suggest?

44:59.332 --> 45:00.791
There will be no victims.

45:02.416 --> 45:04.249
There will be nobody to kill.

45:06.082 --> 45:09.291
CHAPTER 4: VIY

45:13.624 --> 45:19.916
This night, throughout Dikanka
and its surroundings,

45:20.291 --> 45:24.832
all female individuals
under the age of thirty

45:25.041 --> 45:27.916
will fall under the enactment...

45:29.582 --> 45:30.999
of a special provision.

45:31.207 --> 45:32.499
Meaning what?

45:33.624 --> 45:36.291
After dark, all girls
must be kept in sight,

45:36.499 --> 45:39.416
and preferably
not let outside at all,

45:39.624 --> 45:43.207
until the morning,
when the cock crows.

45:43.582 --> 45:46.916
I can't even visit
my child's godmother?

45:47.874 --> 45:52.499
Listen to us! It's for your own good
until we find the killer.

45:53.249 --> 45:56.916
Stop spouting nonsense!
Worse than a Russian drunk!

45:57.124 --> 45:59.207
You're no policeman!

45:59.416 --> 46:02.041
You really don't have
the common touch.

46:02.249 --> 46:04.416
Right! Everyone calm down!

46:06.166 --> 46:08.541
Do not let your girls out of sight!

46:08.999 --> 46:10.166
Understood?

46:11.832 --> 46:13.499
That's all. Now go home.

46:23.582 --> 46:25.749
"The mystery of birth.
A dark one?"

46:29.207 --> 46:31.916
You should sleep, Mr. Gogol.

46:32.124 --> 46:34.207
You're up with that paper all night.

46:36.124 --> 46:37.124
I'll sleep later.

46:39.957 --> 46:42.041
- Yakim...
- Yes?

46:43.457 --> 46:45.791
You've known me from the cradle.

46:45.999 --> 46:50.874
Indeed. I served your parents
before you were born.

46:51.082 --> 46:52.457
Tell me,

46:53.499 --> 46:57.374
did any occurrences
in my childhood seem...

46:58.874 --> 46:59.957
strange?

47:03.416 --> 47:06.916
No. You were sick sometimes,
but nothing special.

47:09.416 --> 47:12.666
If I may, sir,
I will return to my sleep.

47:13.207 --> 47:15.499
Yakim, are you
hiding anything from me?

47:16.832 --> 47:19.291
I wouldn't dream of it, sir.

47:19.957 --> 47:21.666
Get some sleep, Mr. Gogol.

47:32.832 --> 47:39.916
SOROCHINTSY, 1809

47:46.166 --> 47:49.166
Keep going. Push!

48:05.457 --> 48:08.166
Is he... silent?

48:10.624 --> 48:11.749
He's not breathing.

48:25.332 --> 48:30.374
O Lord, have mercy
on your servant, Vastly Gogol.

48:31.791 --> 48:36.249
Let just one child of mine
survive on this earth.

48:37.749 --> 48:39.166
Hear me, O Lord.

48:48.874 --> 48:49.916
Hey, sir...

48:51.791 --> 48:54.249
I know how to ease your pain.

48:55.249 --> 48:58.499
Do you wish
to have a healthy child?

49:00.207 --> 49:01.541
Is that possible?

49:03.124 --> 49:04.707
Everything is possible.

49:07.249 --> 49:10.541
It only depends on
how far you are willing to go.

49:11.916 --> 49:15.916
I would do anything. I cannot...

49:17.124 --> 49:19.166
bury another infant.

50:14.249 --> 50:16.624
Nobody saw who left these marks?

50:17.291 --> 50:21.541
Nobody. These marks
were found on seven houses.

50:22.832 --> 50:25.416
Gentlemen, this is not paint.
It is blood.

50:27.416 --> 50:30.916
Right, everyone to their homes!
Nothing to see here.

50:35.457 --> 50:36.791
How fascinating.

50:37.999 --> 50:39.999
It's very similar to dog fur.

50:48.541 --> 50:50.874
It must have been a warlock.

50:52.416 --> 50:58.874
Grandma told me in my childhood
that they send messages in dog blood.

50:59.332 --> 51:03.082
Warlock or not,
seven houses have been marked,

51:03.291 --> 51:05.291
all of them home to young girls.

51:05.499 --> 51:08.707
These girls have been chosen
as the horseman's victims.

51:09.957 --> 51:11.707
But why leave these marks?

51:13.624 --> 51:18.041
Perhaps he has an accomplice
who helps him identify victims.

51:29.457 --> 51:32.916
Ulyana, have you seen my dog Serko?

51:33.124 --> 51:36.416
- I haven't.
- Where the devil is he?

51:37.624 --> 51:41.624
Did you hear
what has befallen us of late?

51:42.291 --> 51:47.124
The horseman has branded
seven girls with his terrible mark.

51:47.582 --> 51:50.582
- You don't say!
- I swear it is true.

51:52.291 --> 51:55.999
Come now, old lady,
you cannot believe he is real?

51:56.207 --> 51:58.624
At your decrepit age, too!

51:59.249 --> 52:00.624
Laugh all you like.

52:01.416 --> 52:04.957
When he comes for your soul,
you'll laugh even harder!

52:05.166 --> 52:09.332
He is welcome to it!
I do like to laugh.

52:09.541 --> 52:12.999
Off with you, reckless girl!
Why did you come here?

52:27.082 --> 52:28.166
I don't understand.

52:28.374 --> 52:30.666
The horseman killed
peasant girls.

52:30.874 --> 52:35.416
I see why he marked village houses,
but a noble estate?

52:36.457 --> 52:39.874
I suppose a servant girl
is to be taken victim.

52:42.624 --> 52:46.707
The horseman
marked not seven, but eight girls.

52:50.416 --> 52:52.374
The eighth is Lisa.

52:53.791 --> 52:55.374
Mrs. Danishevskaya.

52:56.124 --> 52:57.541
Tomorrow is a feast day.

52:58.499 --> 53:01.999
Mokos Friday.
This means the horseman...

53:02.499 --> 53:04.291
will start to act tonight.

53:04.874 --> 53:06.999
We must hide all these girls.

53:07.832 --> 53:09.166
Where can we do so?

53:09.541 --> 53:11.666
Should we lock them in jail?

53:11.874 --> 53:13.999
They're in danger in the village.

53:15.082 --> 53:21.249
There's an abandoned farm
near Dikanka, a perfect hideout.

53:22.666 --> 53:24.166
Just what we need.

53:25.749 --> 53:28.457
Well, the idea is sensible.

53:28.666 --> 53:32.874
Before dark, we must gather
the girls and send them there.

53:33.082 --> 53:35.457
Nobody can know except us.

53:40.332 --> 53:41.791
Very well. We shall see.

53:46.957 --> 53:50.249
So, Mr. Binkh,
shall we gather the girls?

53:51.124 --> 53:53.666
Hold off for now. That can wait.

53:54.666 --> 53:55.957
I must think.

53:57.874 --> 53:59.457
How do you feel?

54:00.707 --> 54:02.166
I really do not know.

54:02.624 --> 54:05.249
These marks,
murders, the horseman...

54:07.707 --> 54:12.707
I am just glad you are here
and I am no longer in danger.

54:13.957 --> 54:15.874
Sadly, Lisa, that's not the case.

54:16.957 --> 54:19.791
We need to speak
about your safety.

54:19.999 --> 54:20.999
IFFT

54:23.332 --> 54:24.624
Don't be afraid!

54:25.207 --> 54:28.957
I botched a deer shoot,
had to finish it with a knife.

54:29.166 --> 54:30.166
Mr. Gogol.

54:31.874 --> 54:33.166
A pleasure to see you.

54:34.457 --> 54:35.666
Dine with us.

54:37.124 --> 54:39.207
This time I won't accept a refusal.

54:42.499 --> 54:48.791
To the man who risks his life
for our safety.

54:48.999 --> 54:50.666
To you, Mr. Gogol.

54:58.832 --> 55:01.791
- I must ask something of you.
- I'm listening.

55:01.999 --> 55:04.332
It concerns Mrs. Danishevskaya.

55:04.541 --> 55:06.124
I believe...

55:06.332 --> 55:08.457
that she is not safe here.

55:08.666 --> 55:11.207
- Why so?
- The horseman is not caught.

55:11.416 --> 55:14.624
We are sending the village girls

55:14.832 --> 55:19.582
whose houses were marked
to an abandoned farm near Dikanka

55:19.791 --> 55:21.499
under escort for the night.

55:23.082 --> 55:26.999
And I absolutely believe that
your wife should join them.

55:29.416 --> 55:33.332
- For what reason?
- As a precautionary measure.

55:35.832 --> 55:37.457
I take a different view.

55:39.666 --> 55:43.249
- Forgive me, but I insist...
- You insist?

55:44.374 --> 55:47.791
Mr. Gogol, in this house,
only I may insist.

55:50.332 --> 55:56.166
Should you wish to do so,
insist freely in your own home...

55:58.707 --> 56:00.374
with regard to your own wife.

56:08.666 --> 56:12.416
Ah, sorry, I forgot.
You're not married.

56:19.374 --> 56:22.082
Thank you for lunch.
I must go.

56:26.707 --> 56:27.916
Mr. Gogol...

56:30.874 --> 56:35.707
Please forgive Alexey, he is too
proud to accept another's help.

56:37.541 --> 56:40.207
Will he risk your life
for the sake of pride?

56:41.166 --> 56:45.499
Perhaps he is right,
and I am indeed safe here?

56:53.999 --> 56:55.249
F-“IZTRUi

56:56.041 --> 56:59.999
Good day, Vasilina,
have you seen my dog Serko?

57:00.207 --> 57:01.374
No, I haven't.

57:01.832 --> 57:05.082
I'll drag that mongrel by the ears!

58:02.874 --> 58:04.332
Sniffing around, are you?

58:08.291 --> 58:11.291
I'm just taking Papa's overcoat

58:11.916 --> 58:13.291
to be darned.

58:16.999 --> 58:20.416
Don't you want to come inside
and taste my dumplings?

58:25.291 --> 58:26.416
No, thank you.

58:27.582 --> 58:28.957
I have to run.

58:32.541 --> 58:35.082
Run along, my little witch.

58:54.124 --> 58:55.999
Why didn't you give my overcoat?

58:56.791 --> 58:59.791
Papa, do you know Ulyana?

59:00.624 --> 59:03.041
I know of her, but no more.

59:03.666 --> 59:06.416
A truly wicked woman.
Why do you ask about her?

59:07.999 --> 59:09.124
Is Ulyana...

59:10.374 --> 59:12.041
an evil spirit?

59:13.499 --> 59:14.749
Why do you say that?

59:16.499 --> 59:19.791
Come on, speak up.

59:23.499 --> 59:25.791
What is Ulyana doing in Dikanka?

59:25.999 --> 59:29.499
She came from Poltava a year back,
as a modest widow.

59:29.707 --> 59:34.249
We took her in, gave her a home,
before she revealed her true nature.

59:34.707 --> 59:36.499
She clouds others with sin.

59:36.707 --> 59:39.749
Lord forgive me,
she even flirts with the priest.

59:40.457 --> 59:42.666
Could Vasilina have made this up?

59:43.541 --> 59:45.374
We don't lie in my house.

59:45.582 --> 59:49.374
If my daughter says she saw
dumplings fly, then she did.

59:49.999 --> 59:52.416
And there was the dead dog, too.

59:53.041 --> 59:54.166
A dead dog?

59:55.499 --> 59:56.791
Streaming blood.

01:00:01.749 --> 01:00:04.541
It is possible that Ulyana
is the accomplice.

01:00:04.999 --> 01:00:06.207
Where does she live?

01:00:07.041 --> 01:00:09.332
Turn left and go past three houses.

01:00:11.082 --> 01:00:15.166
Go and fetch Mr. Binkh.
We will meet outside her house.

01:00:52.082 --> 01:00:54.207
[speaking mysterious language]

01:01:28.416 --> 01:01:29.624
Disperse, everyone!

01:01:29.832 --> 01:01:31.874
There is nothing here to see!

01:01:34.582 --> 01:01:37.999
Could you really
not have seen the killer at all?

01:01:38.207 --> 01:01:41.291
- Nothing that may identify them?
- I could not.

01:01:41.499 --> 01:01:44.999
So, you let the killer escape,
and remember nothing of them.

01:01:45.791 --> 01:01:47.041
Dr. Bomgart...

01:01:50.124 --> 01:01:52.582
do you know what language this is?

01:01:54.166 --> 01:01:57.499
"Sumito dolis... ongis..."

01:01:58.541 --> 01:02:00.249
It resembles Latin.

01:02:00.832 --> 01:02:04.666
But... I cannot understand
a single word.

01:02:08.457 --> 01:02:11.332
My good man, help me lift her.

01:02:15.166 --> 01:02:16.291
My dear God!

01:02:16.499 --> 01:02:17.666
What is it?

01:02:17.874 --> 01:02:19.207
Look.

01:02:19.416 --> 01:02:23.791
It is no simple nail. It is silver.

01:02:25.957 --> 01:02:28.707
- Look at this, gentlemen.
- May I?

01:02:28.916 --> 01:02:32.666
Such cursed nails
are used to crucify witches.

01:02:33.582 --> 01:02:37.082
So Vasilina was right.

01:02:37.291 --> 01:02:41.666
Ulyana is a witch,
and perhaps served the horseman.

01:02:43.832 --> 01:02:47.416
I still fail to understand
why the devil you came here alone.

01:02:48.749 --> 01:02:50.624
I was afraid of scaring her off.

01:02:53.332 --> 01:02:54.582
"Afraid".

01:02:56.832 --> 01:03:01.666
Mr. Gogol, are you sure
that you did not imagine this killer?

01:03:02.957 --> 01:03:04.249
What are you implying?

01:03:05.499 --> 01:03:09.999
I am not implying anything.
I am merely clarifying.

01:03:11.041 --> 01:03:17.374
So you want to say
that I murdered Ulyana?

01:03:19.582 --> 01:03:20.624
For what reason?

01:03:21.166 --> 01:03:24.166
For what reason would I kill her?

01:03:25.832 --> 01:03:26.791
I don't know.

01:03:28.374 --> 01:03:32.749
But let's speak purely theoretically.

01:03:33.624 --> 01:03:38.249
If Ulyana was indeed
the horseman's accomplice,

01:03:39.166 --> 01:03:40.291
along with you...

01:03:40.874 --> 01:03:44.541
then she could betray you,
so her death would benefit you.

01:03:45.791 --> 01:03:48.666
But that is purely theoretical.

01:03:51.874 --> 01:03:56.791
While you invent baseless theories,
a new killer roams free.

01:03:56.999 --> 01:03:58.791
I saw him with my own eyes.

01:03:58.999 --> 01:04:02.291
You saw him, but cannot recall him.

01:04:16.832 --> 01:04:19.582
Careful, I must still dissect her.

01:04:24.874 --> 01:04:27.041
We must search the entire village.

01:04:27.249 --> 01:04:28.832
And if you don't find him?

01:04:30.791 --> 01:04:33.749
Right now, it is imperative
we send away the girls.

01:04:35.416 --> 01:04:38.666
I still want to weigh up
the pros and cons.

01:04:39.207 --> 01:04:41.374
Can you do it any faster, then?

01:04:42.082 --> 01:04:45.666
It'll be dark soon. What then?

01:04:48.124 --> 01:04:51.791
Mr. Binkh, do we take
the girls to the farm?

01:04:54.332 --> 01:04:55.791
I still have my doubts.

01:04:56.916 --> 01:05:01.166
But you yourself said
the investigator's idea is sound.

01:05:01.707 --> 01:05:05.166
My doubts are with regard him.

01:05:15.207 --> 01:05:16.499
Open the gates!

01:05:21.874 --> 01:05:24.582
Our deceased
did indeed give me a surprise.

01:05:25.166 --> 01:05:29.541
No signs of decomposition,
tissues remain firm.

01:05:29.749 --> 01:05:33.457
If she had blood,
I would think her still alive.

01:05:34.207 --> 01:05:36.499
The stake was driven into the heart,

01:05:37.249 --> 01:05:39.957
as if someone wished
to slay a witch.

01:05:40.166 --> 01:05:43.999
Not that I believe such nonsense.
Including resurrection.

01:05:44.207 --> 01:05:49.041
Strange to hear from a man who
drags people back into this world.

01:05:49.749 --> 01:05:51.291
Come now, Mr. Gogol.

01:05:53.207 --> 01:05:54.374
What's the use?

01:05:55.541 --> 01:05:56.957
Sooner or later...

01:05:57.582 --> 01:06:01.249
each of my patients will succumb
to that figure with a scythe.

01:06:01.707 --> 01:06:03.499
Never to return.

01:06:11.291 --> 01:06:13.416
Once, I attempted...

01:06:15.166 --> 01:06:20.291
to resurrect a child
who had died during surgery.

01:06:23.666 --> 01:06:25.332
I used electrical shocks.

01:06:27.624 --> 01:06:31.249
It didn't work.
There was a big scandal.

01:06:32.332 --> 01:06:34.916
It was that experiment
that led to my exile.

01:06:37.791 --> 01:06:42.541
We cannot conquer death,
which means life has no meaning.

01:06:43.499 --> 01:06:46.582
Your time is wasted, Mr. Gogol.
Nobody is spared.

01:06:46.791 --> 01:06:47.916
I cannot agree,

01:06:48.124 --> 01:06:50.957
God gave us life for a reason.

01:06:51.166 --> 01:06:53.041
I do not believe in your God,

01:06:53.749 --> 01:06:56.166
just as I don't
believe in resurrection.

01:06:57.291 --> 01:06:58.624
Your lack of belief

01:06:58.832 --> 01:07:01.499
does you more harm
than your drunkenness.

01:07:09.499 --> 01:07:12.666
To your health, witch.

01:07:30.416 --> 01:07:31.374
I will go.

01:07:40.207 --> 01:07:42.624
You know what? I forgive you.

01:07:43.499 --> 01:07:46.832
I will not think of your Lisa.
Why anger myself?

01:07:47.041 --> 01:07:49.416
It's not like you'll ever be together.

01:07:49.624 --> 01:07:53.166
She is married. But I am free.

01:07:54.666 --> 01:07:56.041
I'm like a cool stream.

01:07:56.249 --> 01:07:58.582
- I can quench your thirst...
- Stop it.

01:08:01.082 --> 01:08:02.541
Can you read this?

01:08:04.041 --> 01:08:07.041
How should I know?
I'm just a miller's daughter.

01:08:14.166 --> 01:08:15.832
Then do you recognize this?

01:08:18.291 --> 01:08:19.249
What's wrong?

01:08:21.291 --> 01:08:24.791
Put it back! It is a holy
weapon against evil spirits!

01:08:25.707 --> 01:08:27.749
You are torturing me,
you monster!

01:08:28.124 --> 01:08:29.082
Sorry.

01:08:29.291 --> 01:08:32.832
So it really was a ritual killing,
and Ulyana really was...

01:08:36.749 --> 01:08:41.374
We searched from top to bottom,
but did not find our demon.

01:08:45.374 --> 01:08:48.541
Shall we gather the girls?
Or not?

01:08:48.749 --> 01:08:51.541
Tesak, you've been
annoying me all day!

01:08:53.416 --> 01:08:56.041
Mr. Binkh, I've worked it out.

01:08:56.249 --> 01:08:58.874
The killer will return
to complete a ritual.

01:08:59.832 --> 01:09:02.082
- Return where?
- I'll show you.

01:09:02.957 --> 01:09:04.207
I need your help.

01:10:22.166 --> 01:10:23.166
Remarkable.

01:10:23.874 --> 01:10:28.541
We were here fighting like lions,
and that old soak doesn't stir a bit.

01:10:30.499 --> 01:10:36.124
Mr. Gogol, I cannot deny
I had suspicions concerning you.

01:10:36.582 --> 01:10:39.916
Please forgive me.
I accept my error.

01:10:40.124 --> 01:10:41.832
It is not your first.

01:10:47.249 --> 01:10:50.249
Who are you? Name? Title?

01:10:52.832 --> 01:10:54.999
Will you be silent
as a lamb all day?

01:10:56.374 --> 01:10:58.624
You will answer our questions!

01:10:58.832 --> 01:11:01.624
From what I understand,
Ulyana was a witch,

01:11:02.332 --> 01:11:06.791
and you killed her for something,
a kind of ritual or rite?

01:11:06.999 --> 01:11:08.749
Witches, rites, rituals!

01:11:08.957 --> 01:11:11.999
Mr. Gogol, can't you see
he's a common murderer?

01:11:23.832 --> 01:11:25.124
Do you recognize this?

01:11:33.499 --> 01:11:34.457
LBJ] PET-iii

01:11:35.249 --> 01:11:36.416
It is very clear.

01:11:37.582 --> 01:11:39.624
He is simply mocking us.

01:11:39.832 --> 01:11:43.291
It is dark Latin, for casting spells.
You won't understand.

01:11:44.207 --> 01:11:48.082
When the blind lead the blind,
both shall fall into the ditch.

01:11:48.291 --> 01:11:50.749
The Gospel of Matthew, 15:14

01:11:50.957 --> 01:11:52.249
Who is blind here?

01:11:52.457 --> 01:11:55.916
Wait, how do you
know the scripture so well?

01:11:56.124 --> 01:11:57.124
How?

01:11:58.499 --> 01:12:00.291
My name is Khoma Brut.

01:12:01.041 --> 01:12:03.749
Theologian by education,
exorcist by trade.

01:12:03.957 --> 01:12:05.291
An exorcist? You?

01:12:08.416 --> 01:12:10.374
While you catch criminals,

01:12:10.957 --> 01:12:13.666
I am called on
by the church to fight evil.

01:12:14.124 --> 01:12:18.749
I wander, seek out the possessed,
and conduct purification rites.

01:12:18.957 --> 01:12:20.541
What brings you to Dikanka?

01:12:22.249 --> 01:12:25.249
I have chased this witch
for almost three years.

01:12:25.457 --> 01:12:29.499
She was always on the move.
I almost got her, then you came!

01:12:29.707 --> 01:12:33.041
Goodness gracious!
Hunting evil spirits, eh?

01:12:34.374 --> 01:12:37.041
I see right through you, scoundrel.

01:12:38.707 --> 01:12:41.957
You only wish to justify
your acts of murder!

01:12:42.957 --> 01:12:46.041
Fighting evil? Who will believe you?

01:12:46.582 --> 01:12:48.249
I do not need your belief.

01:12:48.457 --> 01:12:53.249
- Wait until you get hard labor!
- Let us return to the inscription.

01:12:53.457 --> 01:12:56.957
If you know this language,
tell me what it says.

01:13:05.541 --> 01:13:07.416
If you move, he's dead!

01:13:09.832 --> 01:13:10.916
Get in the cell.

01:13:24.041 --> 01:13:25.249
Lock the door.

01:13:30.124 --> 01:13:33.416
If but one hair
falls from Mr. Gogol's head,

01:13:33.624 --> 01:13:35.416
I will hang you from a post!

01:13:36.166 --> 01:13:37.207
The keys!

01:13:45.957 --> 01:13:50.291
I will not hang you,
I will bury you alive!

01:13:54.957 --> 01:13:56.582
Lower your hands.

01:13:56.791 --> 01:13:59.499
The Lord said,
"Fear not: thou shalt not die".

01:13:59.707 --> 01:14:02.249
Judges, 6:23.

01:14:02.457 --> 01:14:04.499
How did you free yourself?

01:14:04.707 --> 01:14:06.957
A wooden hand,
just like a real one.

01:14:07.166 --> 01:14:09.624
A craftsman made it for me in Kiev.

01:14:10.499 --> 01:14:11.832
What do you want?

01:14:12.041 --> 01:14:15.541
I need your help.
I must complete the rite.

01:14:15.749 --> 01:14:18.041
You and I both know
Ulyana's a witch.

01:14:18.249 --> 01:14:20.791
Are you not curious
as to what is going on?

01:14:23.166 --> 01:14:24.207
I am.

01:14:58.332 --> 01:14:59.332
I

01:15:01.582 --> 01:15:03.749
Easy, easy...

01:15:08.832 --> 01:15:12.041
- Mr. Binkh? What...?
- Where are they?

01:15:12.791 --> 01:15:15.124
- Who?
- Let me out. The keys are there.

01:15:15.582 --> 01:15:18.707
- Right away.
- Gather the Cossacks.

01:15:18.916 --> 01:15:21.999
Send some to search
for the criminal Khoma Brut.

01:15:22.207 --> 01:15:24.166
Take care, he has Gogol hostage.

01:15:26.582 --> 01:15:30.541
The others can take
the marked girls to the farm.

01:15:37.582 --> 01:15:39.166
Stop right there.

01:15:41.041 --> 01:15:42.291
There's no escape.

01:15:43.874 --> 01:15:45.874
Mr. Gogol, thank God you're alive.

01:15:46.332 --> 01:15:49.291
- Vakula, let us past.
- What do you mean?

01:15:49.749 --> 01:15:53.541
Mr. Binkh is in a rage.
The whole village is on alert.

01:15:53.749 --> 01:15:55.041
I need this man.

01:15:58.832 --> 01:16:00.916
And how should I understand that?

01:16:01.124 --> 01:16:05.666
Look, we need to
complete a rite in the church.

01:16:07.791 --> 01:16:08.999
Trust me.

01:16:18.791 --> 01:16:21.582
And please, not a word to Binkh.

01:16:27.457 --> 01:16:29.624
Hurry up, get moving.

01:16:35.957 --> 01:16:38.124
Where are you taking her so late?

01:16:38.332 --> 01:16:41.291
We're under police orders.
I can say no more.

01:16:41.749 --> 01:16:43.291
Is that all of them?

01:16:43.499 --> 01:16:45.249
- Yes, sir!
- Excellent.

01:16:45.457 --> 01:16:47.999
Have the felon
and Mr. Gogol been found?

01:16:50.166 --> 01:16:51.332
We're looking.

01:16:54.207 --> 01:16:55.207
Let's go.

01:17:05.666 --> 01:17:07.082
This will be dangerous.

01:17:07.291 --> 01:17:10.832
The last time I encountered Viy,
it ended like this.

01:17:12.416 --> 01:17:15.041
And who is this "Viy"
of whom you speak?

01:17:15.249 --> 01:17:16.832
A demon from hell.

01:17:18.957 --> 01:17:21.124
He gives power to evil spirits.

01:17:21.332 --> 01:17:23.749
I have been hunting him for years.

01:17:30.666 --> 01:17:32.749
Will you use Ulyana as bait?

01:17:32.957 --> 01:17:35.041
Yes, she is a strong witch.

01:17:35.249 --> 01:17:38.374
If she summons him,
he will come.

01:17:38.582 --> 01:17:40.249
And I will destroy him!

01:17:47.749 --> 01:17:50.791
Why are you so sure
you'll defeat him?

01:17:50.999 --> 01:17:54.374
You've already lost a hand.
Want to lose your head, too?

01:17:56.582 --> 01:18:00.707
Your paper
is a spell written in dark Latin.

01:18:00.916 --> 01:18:03.499
And it's the only thing
that can stop Viy.

01:18:05.082 --> 01:18:07.291
And if it doesn't work?

01:18:10.707 --> 01:18:14.416
And if Christ be not risen,
then is our preaching vain.

01:18:14.624 --> 01:18:18.041
Corinthians, 15:14.

01:18:18.791 --> 01:18:21.457
God willing, we'll manage.
Enter the circle.

01:18:33.041 --> 01:18:35.124
Quick, enter the circle.

01:18:47.957 --> 01:18:49.249
What's wrong with you?

01:18:56.707 --> 01:18:58.832
Inside! Quick! Hurry!

01:19:00.207 --> 01:19:01.916
Come on! Hurry!

01:19:35.791 --> 01:19:36.791
Tell me,

01:19:37.749 --> 01:19:41.082
do you ever experience strange things?

01:19:41.291 --> 01:19:43.124
Mysterious dreams or visions?

01:19:44.832 --> 01:19:48.166
- Why do you ask?
- I feel your dark side.

01:19:49.291 --> 01:19:52.416
And who knows,
it might help us tonight.

01:19:53.041 --> 01:19:54.624
I am sure you are mistaken.

01:19:55.332 --> 01:19:56.832
I am sure I am not.

01:20:07.916 --> 01:20:09.999
How long must we sit here?

01:20:11.166 --> 01:20:13.832
"In your patience
possess ye your souls"

01:20:14.041 --> 01:20:17.332
Luke, 21:19.

01:20:20.624 --> 01:20:24.457
Enough. Binkh was right.
You were not to be trusted.

01:20:26.291 --> 01:20:29.666
- I committed a crime for you.
- You're not leaving!

01:20:57.707 --> 01:21:00.874
We both will survive,
no matter what.

01:21:02.041 --> 01:21:03.249
Which gospel is that?

01:21:03.791 --> 01:21:06.207
The Gospel of Khoma Brut.

01:21:26.041 --> 01:21:27.291
HEY, Stepan!

01:21:27.749 --> 01:21:29.249
What's so funny?

01:21:29.457 --> 01:21:31.166
You never know with girls!

01:21:42.416 --> 01:21:43.499
Stepan!

01:22:28.416 --> 01:22:29.916
Help me.

01:23:16.166 --> 01:23:17.291
Don't go there!

01:23:17.499 --> 01:23:18.666
Be quiet!

01:24:35.332 --> 01:24:39.874
I'll pull this witch hunter
from under the ground if need be.

01:24:40.832 --> 01:24:43.707
Vakula, did you find anyone?

01:24:44.249 --> 01:24:45.332
Not a soul.

01:24:45.541 --> 01:24:47.666
Mr. Binkh!

01:24:50.041 --> 01:24:51.207
The farm!

01:25:14.499 --> 01:25:16.041
I know who you are.

01:25:16.707 --> 01:25:18.374
You are just like me.

01:25:19.624 --> 01:25:20.624
If?)

01:26:48.249 --> 01:26:49.874
God Almighty!

01:26:51.457 --> 01:26:53.166
In all that is holy!

01:26:53.707 --> 01:26:55.916
What have you done?

01:26:57.666 --> 01:27:00.999
The horseman has celebrated
Mokos Friday.

01:27:01.832 --> 01:27:03.374
I felt it from the start.

01:27:04.041 --> 01:27:07.541
Mr. Binkh,
what does all this mean?

01:27:08.082 --> 01:27:11.041
We brought the girls here
to be slaughtered?

01:27:11.457 --> 01:27:13.291
That's what he wanted.

01:27:14.499 --> 01:27:16.416
He marked the houses...

01:27:17.666 --> 01:27:20.624
so we would bring them
to one place.

01:27:24.249 --> 01:27:30.166
But... how did he know
we brought them here?

01:27:32.666 --> 01:27:36.999
Let us ask the man
who planned it all.

01:27:37.207 --> 01:27:40.957
I need Gogol, and I need him alive.

01:27:42.957 --> 01:27:44.749
I know where he is.

01:27:48.082 --> 01:27:50.291
You left the marks on the houses!

01:27:51.457 --> 01:27:52.541
I did.

01:27:52.749 --> 01:27:55.916
- Do you serve the horseman?
- I do.

01:27:56.499 --> 01:27:57.916
Tell me his name!

01:28:01.416 --> 01:28:02.916
Tell me his name!

01:28:23.707 --> 01:28:24.999
You are a dark one!

01:28:25.207 --> 01:28:27.374
Read on! You can do it!

01:28:28.499 --> 01:28:30.541
You must wait for Viy!
