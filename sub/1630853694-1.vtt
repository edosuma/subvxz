WEBVTT

00:06.439 --> 00:11.244
A HELL SPAWN HAS
RETURNED TO EARTH SOULLESS,

00:11.311 --> 00:16.116
HIS MIND RAVAGED,
HIS MEMORY SHATTERED...

00:16.182 --> 00:18.918
THEY TOOK
EVERYTHING FROM ME !

00:18.985 --> 00:21.054
THEY MADE ME
A MONSTER.

00:21.121 --> 00:23.056
YOU'RE ALONE
NOW, SPAWN.

00:23.123 --> 00:26.259
AIN'T NO ONE COVERING
YOUR BACK ANYMORE.

00:29.195 --> 00:31.064
I FOUND YOU.

00:31.131 --> 00:32.332
GET AWAY
FROM ME !

00:39.105 --> 00:44.043
THIS IS TRULY WHAT
HELL IS, OLD MAN.

00:45.645 --> 00:47.213
I WOULD DO MY LIFE
ALL OVER AGAIN

00:47.280 --> 00:48.882
IN THE WORLD'S
WORST SHIT HOLE,

00:48.948 --> 00:54.053
THAN TO BE HERE,
NOW, LIKE THIS.

00:57.023 --> 00:58.925
IT'S ME WANDA,
I'M YOUR HUSBAND.

00:58.992 --> 01:03.430
DON'T CRY MAMA,
THAT WAS THE SAD MAN.

01:03.496 --> 01:06.666
( Cogliostro )
YOU HAVE BROUGHT THIS
EVIL INTO HER LIFE,

01:06.733 --> 01:09.569
THE STINK OF HELL
BROUGHT BACK FROM YOUR MASTER.

01:09.636 --> 01:10.637
MASTER ?

01:10.703 --> 01:12.705
WHO DO YOU THINK WRAPPED
YOU IN THAT SHROUD ?

01:12.772 --> 01:14.274
IT WAS MALEBOLGIA.

01:14.340 --> 01:17.644
ARE YOU GONNA SEND HIM
THE DARK SOUL OF JASON WYNN ?

01:17.710 --> 01:18.945
WYNN HAD ME MURDERED,

01:19.012 --> 01:20.680
HE'LL KILL WANDA TOO
IF I DON'T STOP HIM.

01:23.550 --> 01:25.785
I CAN'T GO ON
LIKE THIS ANYMORE.

01:25.852 --> 01:28.087
HIDING IN
THE SHADOWS.

01:28.154 --> 01:29.322
I'M SICK OF IT.

01:37.096 --> 01:39.966
( Cogliostro )
I CAN SHOW YOU HOW
TO BREAK THE CURSE.

01:40.033 --> 01:43.436
BUT YOU HAVE TO STOP
THE SAVAGE KILLING.

01:47.774 --> 01:50.710
( Spawn )
I'M COMING FOR YOU,
JASON WYNN.

01:50.777 --> 01:52.745
DON'T YOU
REMEMBER ME ?

01:52.812 --> 01:55.081
YOU HAD ME
BURNED ALIVE.

01:55.148 --> 01:58.318
( Cogliostro )
MALEBOLGIA HAS BEEN
GUIDING BOTH OF YOU.

01:58.384 --> 02:00.520
HOW DO YOU
KNOW THESE THINGS ?

02:00.587 --> 02:03.890
BECAUSE HE WAS ONCE
MY MASTER, TOO.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.092
WHO ARE YOU ?

02:40.560 --> 02:42.495
NO !

03:24.537 --> 03:26.472
GOOD OR EVIL,

03:26.539 --> 03:28.274
WE HAVE TO
ULTIMATELY CHOOSE

03:28.341 --> 03:30.176
ONE OR THE OTHER
IN LIFE.

03:30.243 --> 03:32.145
WE ALL THINK
THAT WE'RE GOOD.

03:32.211 --> 03:33.613
SO WHERE DOES
THE EVIL COME FROM ?

03:33.680 --> 03:34.681
WHERE IS IT
HIDING ?

03:34.747 --> 03:36.182
WHEN THE LIGHTS
ARE ON,

03:36.249 --> 03:38.585
IT SEEMS THE DARKNESS
IS HELD AT BAY,

03:38.651 --> 03:40.954
JUST SITTING THERE AT
THE EDGE OF THE LIGHT.

03:41.020 --> 03:43.790
BUT EVIL, IT EXISTS
BECAUSE WE CREATE IT.

03:43.856 --> 03:45.692
BUT NOT OUT THERE,

03:45.758 --> 03:48.027
IT COMES
FROM THE INSIDE.

03:52.098 --> 03:53.967
( evil laughter )

04:08.214 --> 04:10.450
( chatter )

04:15.688 --> 04:17.924
DON'T LET THE
DEMONS TAKE YOU...

04:17.991 --> 04:21.527
... DON'T LET
THE DEMONS TAKE YOU...

04:21.594 --> 04:23.229
... DON'T LET THE
DEMONS TAKE YOU...

04:23.296 --> 04:24.964
... DON'T LET
THE DEMONS TAKE YOU...

04:25.031 --> 04:26.666
... DON'T LET THE
DEMONS TAKE YOU...

04:26.733 --> 04:29.535
... DON'T LET THE
DEMONS TAKE YOU...

04:51.190 --> 04:53.893
( demented laughter )

04:56.195 --> 04:59.232
... DON'T LET THE
DEMONS TAKE YOU...

05:04.037 --> 05:07.106
WITHIN THE SOULS
OF EVERY HELL SPAWN,

05:07.173 --> 05:09.442
A BATTLE IS WAGED.

05:09.509 --> 05:13.980
WHAT SCRAPS OF HUMANITY
CAN THEY HOLD ONTO ?

05:14.047 --> 05:16.916
WHAT MASTER
WILL THEY SERVE ?

05:21.320 --> 05:23.122
EVERY HELL SPAWN,

05:23.189 --> 05:26.125
ALL THE WAY BACK
TO THE PRIMORDIAL PAST,

05:26.192 --> 05:29.696
HAS LOST THEIR STRUGGLE
WITH THE DARKNESS.

05:35.468 --> 05:37.570
EACH ONE
SANK INTO THE PIT

05:37.637 --> 05:41.240
TO SIT AT THE RIGHT
HAND OF MALEBOLGIA,

05:41.307 --> 05:45.611
TO WAIT FOR THE FINAL
BATTLE AGAINST THE LIGHT.

05:52.618 --> 05:54.854
( horse neighing )

06:03.563 --> 06:05.698
CHOOSE, HELL SPAWN.

06:05.765 --> 06:08.534
WHAT MASTER
DO YOU SERVE ?

06:08.601 --> 06:12.071
I SERVE...
NO MASTER !

06:36.529 --> 06:39.766
HE CAME TO YOU AGAIN,
DIDN'T HE ?

06:39.832 --> 06:43.302
THE BLACK KNIGHT WILL
KEEP COMING TO YOU.

06:43.369 --> 06:46.773
TORMENTING YOU
UNTIL YOU CHOOSE.

06:46.839 --> 06:48.975
HOW DO YOU
KNOW MY DREAMS ?

06:49.041 --> 06:50.676
WITHIN YOU ARE
THE REMNANTS OF

06:50.743 --> 06:53.880
OTHER HELL SPAWNS
FROM THE PAST.

06:53.946 --> 06:59.118
YOU AND I ARE CONNECTED
ACROSS THE MILLENNIUM.

06:59.185 --> 07:01.921
YOU'RE NOTHING
LIKE ME.

07:01.988 --> 07:04.157
YOU CAN'T KNOW
WHAT I FEEL.

07:04.223 --> 07:08.060
IT'S TIME YOU HAD
THE COLD HARD TRUTH.

07:08.127 --> 07:10.463
I'M NEARLY
OUT OF TIME.

07:10.530 --> 07:12.532
AND YOU ARE THE
ONLY HOPE I HAVE

07:12.598 --> 07:14.500
TO FINISH MY JOURNEY.

07:14.567 --> 07:16.002
LOOK, OLD MAN,

07:16.068 --> 07:18.871
I DON'T KNOW HOW YOU KNOW
ABOUT THE DREAMS I HAVE.

07:18.938 --> 07:22.041
MAYBE I YELLED OUT,
BUT THAT'S ALL IT WAS.

07:22.108 --> 07:24.143
A BAD DREAM.

07:24.210 --> 07:25.845
HUMANS DREAM,

07:25.912 --> 07:28.881
NOT DEAD MEN WHO
HAVE SOLD THEIR SOULS.

07:28.948 --> 07:30.416
GET AWAY FROM ME.

07:30.483 --> 07:32.218
VIOLENCE
IS ALL YOU KNOW.

07:32.285 --> 07:33.653
YOU THRIVE ON IT.

07:33.719 --> 07:36.355
BUT IT ONLY SENDS MORE
SOULS TO YOUR MASTER.

07:36.422 --> 07:38.090
IT MAKES HIM STRONGER.

07:38.157 --> 07:40.226
I HAVE NO MASTER.

07:40.293 --> 07:44.197
YES, YOU DO...
MALEBOLGIA.

07:44.263 --> 07:46.999
AND HE CHOSE
THE RIGHT MAN.

07:47.066 --> 07:48.100
LOOK AT ME.

07:48.167 --> 07:49.836
I'M NOT A
MAN ANYMORE.

07:49.902 --> 07:51.871
YOU WERE
A MAN, ONCE.

07:51.938 --> 07:54.707
YOU CAN BE
A MAN AGAIN.

07:54.774 --> 07:56.409
THE ONE YOU CALL
MALEBOLGIA,

07:56.475 --> 07:58.444
HE CAN'T BE REAL.

07:58.511 --> 08:00.813
HE IS REAL
AND YOU KNOW IT.

08:00.880 --> 08:03.850
WHAT DO YOU
WANT FROM ME ?

08:03.916 --> 08:06.018
I WANT YOU TO REMOVE
THAT SCARLET SHROUD,

08:06.085 --> 08:10.122
A HELL SPAWN CAN BE
FREE OF THE CURSE.

08:10.189 --> 08:12.058
HOW CAN
YOU KNOW THAT ?

08:12.124 --> 08:14.660
BECAUSE I AM FREE.

08:16.696 --> 08:19.065
( music thumping )

08:24.770 --> 08:26.472
WHERE ARE WE
GOING FIRST ?

08:26.539 --> 08:28.708
WHAT ABOUT THAT CLUB
WE USED TO GO TO ON 42nd ?

08:28.774 --> 08:30.877
HEY, COLLEGE BOY,

08:30.943 --> 08:32.678
YOU'VE BEEN
GONE TOO LONG.

08:32.745 --> 08:33.980
WE DON'T GO
THERE ANYMORE.

08:34.046 --> 08:36.382
IN FACT, YOU DON'T
ASK WHERE WE GO.

08:36.449 --> 08:38.284
WE GO WHERE
I DRIVE.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.152
YEAH, WE GO
WHERE HE DRIVES.

08:44.557 --> 08:46.726
THERE'S NOTHING LIKE
A SATURDAY NIGHT.

08:46.792 --> 08:47.727
HEY, JOEY,

08:47.793 --> 08:49.362
YOU CAN HAVE A REAL
WOMAN TONIGHT, HUH ?

08:49.428 --> 08:50.997
NOT THAT COLLEGE
PEACH FUZZ.

08:51.063 --> 08:52.431
( Joey )
JESUS, FRANKIE,

08:52.498 --> 08:53.733
YOU KNOW I'M GOING
OUT WITH GINA.

08:53.799 --> 08:55.501
( mimicking )
YOU KNOW I'M GOING
OUT WITH GINA.

08:55.568 --> 08:57.737
HEY, PETEY,

08:57.803 --> 08:59.772
YOU WERE ALWAYS
THE SMARTEST GUY IN SCHOOL,

08:59.839 --> 09:01.307
YOU KNOW HOW
TO WORK IT.

09:01.374 --> 09:02.842
HOW COME YOU DIDN'T
GO TO COLLEGE ?

09:02.909 --> 09:04.844
I HAD SOME GOOD
BUSINESS OPPORTUNITIES.

09:04.911 --> 09:07.146
I KNOW A SWEET
SETUP WHEN I SEE IT.

09:07.213 --> 09:08.614
THAT'S WHAT
SEPARATES ME

09:08.681 --> 09:10.149
FROM THE REST OF
THE DUMB FUCKS

09:10.216 --> 09:11.717
IN THIS NEIGHBORHOOD.

09:11.784 --> 09:13.386
WHAT ARE WE DOING
AT ORVETTI'S ?

09:13.452 --> 09:14.820
HE'S CLOSING UP.

09:14.887 --> 09:16.222
JUST FOR OLD
TIME'S SAKE

09:16.289 --> 09:18.557
LIKE WHEN WE WERE KIDS
CRUISING THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

09:18.624 --> 09:19.792
REMEMBER HOW
"MR. O"

09:19.859 --> 09:21.327
USED TO SLIP US
CANDY ON THE SLY

09:21.394 --> 09:22.929
SO HIS OLD LADY
WOULDN'T SEE ?

09:22.995 --> 09:24.063
REMEMBER
THAT, PETEY ?

09:24.130 --> 09:25.498
HE WAS COOL.

09:25.564 --> 09:27.600
LAST OF THE GUYS
FROM THE OLD COUNTRY.

09:27.667 --> 09:29.869
WHEN MOM GOT SICK AND
AFTER WHEN SHE WAS GONE

09:29.936 --> 09:32.605
HE USED TO BRING BAGS
OF GROCERIES UP TO
THE APARTMENT.

09:32.672 --> 09:33.906
THAT'S RIGHT.

09:33.973 --> 09:35.341
C'MON, LET'S GO IN.

09:35.408 --> 09:36.876
SEE WHAT'S UP
WITH HIM.

09:39.812 --> 09:41.981
( Italian music )

09:43.149 --> 09:44.850
MR. ORVETTI,
YOU CLOSING UP ?

09:44.917 --> 09:46.819
HEY, I'M NEVER
CLOSED FOR YOU BOYS.

09:46.886 --> 09:48.888
YOU SHOULD COME DOWN TO
THE NEIGHBORHOOD MORE.

09:48.955 --> 09:50.456
HEY, MR. ORVETTI,

09:50.523 --> 09:52.158
YOU GOT ANY OF THAT
CANNOLI YOU USED TO GIVE-- ?

09:52.224 --> 09:53.926
FORGET ABOUT IT.

09:53.993 --> 09:56.495
I GOT CANNOLI, I GOT PASTA,
I GOT EVERYTHING.

09:56.562 --> 09:58.631
MANGIA, EAT, EAT.

09:58.698 --> 09:59.765
LOOK AT
YOU KIDS.

09:59.832 --> 10:01.934
ME, I SEE MEN
IN MY STORE TONIGHT.

10:02.001 --> 10:04.136
NOT LITTLE
BOYS ANYMORE.

10:04.203 --> 10:06.138
HEY, MR. O.,
IT'S JOEY...

10:08.174 --> 10:10.576
JESUS !

10:10.643 --> 10:12.578
WHY THE FUCK
DID YOU DO THAT ?

10:12.645 --> 10:15.381
HOLY SHIT !

10:15.448 --> 10:19.185
THAT'S THE WAY IT'S DONE
FRANKIE, QUICK, EASY.

10:19.251 --> 10:21.320
GETS A LITTLE
MESSY SOMETIMES.

10:21.387 --> 10:23.022
HEY, FORGET
ABOUT IT.

10:23.089 --> 10:24.590
WHAT'S DONE
IS DONE.

10:24.657 --> 10:25.624
JESUS, PETEY,

10:25.691 --> 10:27.226
WHAT DID YOU DO
TO MY CANNOLI ?

10:27.293 --> 10:28.794
THERE'S FUCKING
BRAINS IN IT !

10:28.861 --> 10:30.796
HOW AM I SUPPOSED TO
EAT THIS SHIT, HUH ?

10:30.863 --> 10:33.065
I'VE BEEN AROUND LONGER
THAN YOU, FRANKIE.

10:33.132 --> 10:34.834
SO YOU GOTTA LISTEN
TO ME A LITTLE BIT.

10:34.900 --> 10:38.404
IF YOU WANT TO GET NOTICED,
YOU GOTTA DO FAVORS.

10:38.471 --> 10:39.972
I DON'T WANT ANY
PART OF THIS, MAN.

10:40.039 --> 10:41.007
THE COPS ASK ME,

10:41.073 --> 10:43.342
I'M GOING TO TELL
THEM WHAT YOU DID.

10:43.409 --> 10:45.077
SHUT UP, JOEY.

10:45.144 --> 10:47.246
I'M NOT GOING TO PRISON
FOR THIS, PETEY,

10:47.313 --> 10:48.681
YOU DUMB FUCK !

10:48.748 --> 10:50.950
STAND STILL,
I GOT MY EYE ON YOU.

10:51.017 --> 10:52.351
YOU KILLED HIM
FOR NOTHING !

10:52.418 --> 10:53.786
EASY KID,
C'MON.

10:53.853 --> 10:55.654
( Joey )
WHAT'S GOING ON ?

10:55.721 --> 10:57.623
YOU GOTTA TELL ME
WHAT'S HAPPENING HERE.

10:57.690 --> 11:00.092
FRANKIE, DON'T WORRY
IT'S NOTHING.

11:00.159 --> 11:02.228
GET IN THE FUCKING
CAR, ALRIGHT ?

11:02.294 --> 11:04.296
LET'S JUST GO, C'MON.

11:07.800 --> 11:09.668
OKAY, WHAT'S
DONE IS DONE.

11:09.735 --> 11:11.804
HE'S DEAD, WE JUST
GOTTA KEEP IT TOGETHER.

11:11.871 --> 11:13.472
GOTTA KEEP IT COOL.

11:13.539 --> 11:14.673
I'M GONNA
GET SICK.

11:14.740 --> 11:15.941
LIGHTEN UP.

11:16.008 --> 11:18.677
HAVE A TOKE, YOU NEED
TO RELAX A LITTLE.

11:18.744 --> 11:21.013
GET ME OUT OF HERE,
I CAN'T BREATHE, MAN.

11:21.080 --> 11:22.715
SHUT UP.

11:22.782 --> 11:24.583
JUST SHUT UP
ALL OF YOUS.

11:24.650 --> 11:26.352
I GOTTA WORK
THINGS OUT.

11:26.419 --> 11:28.387
I'M GONNA PUKE !

11:30.523 --> 11:31.857
PULL OVER.

11:31.924 --> 11:34.560
BE A MAN, THERE'S
AN ALLEY UP AHEAD.

11:49.442 --> 11:52.478
YOU MADE A BIG MISTAKE,
FRANKIE, BRINGING HIM.

11:52.545 --> 11:54.513
I AIN'T GONNA LIE
TO YOU, FRANKIE.

11:54.580 --> 11:56.816
I DON'T THINK JOEY'S
GONNA MAKE IT
HOME TONIGHT.

11:56.882 --> 12:00.486
HE'S JUST SICK, PETEY,
I'LL TAKE CARE OF HIM.

12:00.553 --> 12:03.022
HE'S NOT FROM
THE STREETS,

12:03.089 --> 12:05.424
HE DIDN'T GET INTO
THE ARMY LIKE US.

12:05.491 --> 12:06.759
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.

12:06.826 --> 12:10.496
I'M SAYING HE'S NOT GONNA
MAKE IT HOME AT ALL.

12:11.664 --> 12:14.500
SO, YOU DO IT, FRANKIE,
YOU TAKE CARE OF HIM.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.269
RIGHT NOW.

12:31.283 --> 12:33.452
C'MON, MOVE,
LET'S GO.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.156
C'MON, MOVE,
LET'S GO !

12:37.223 --> 12:39.058
WHAT'S GOING ON,
FRANKIE ?

12:39.125 --> 12:43.629
WHAT'S GOING ON ?
TALK TO ME !

12:43.696 --> 12:46.432
C'MON, MAN.

12:46.499 --> 12:48.767
DON'T JOKE AROUND.

12:53.772 --> 12:55.341
FRANKIE, WHAT
ARE YOU DOING ?

12:55.407 --> 12:56.775
I'M YOUR BEST FRIEND.

12:56.842 --> 12:58.344
PUT THE GUN
AWAY, MAN.

13:08.053 --> 13:09.555
YOU THINK
HE'LL DO IT ?

13:09.622 --> 13:11.524
IF FRANKIE'S SMART.

13:11.590 --> 13:14.593
I DON'T WANT TO STAY OUT
ALL NIGHT BURYING BODIES.

13:17.096 --> 13:19.832
I THOUGHT WE WERE
BUDDIES, FRANKIE !

13:19.899 --> 13:22.301
WHAT ARE
YOU DOING ?

13:22.368 --> 13:24.203
DON'T SHOOT ME, MAN !

13:24.270 --> 13:26.038
I'M BEGGING YOU,
I DON'T WANNA DIE !

13:26.105 --> 13:27.873
SHUT UP, JOEY.

13:27.940 --> 13:30.609
IT'S YOUR FAULT,
YOU BROUGHT THIS
ON YOURSELF.

13:30.676 --> 13:32.912
IF YOU HADN'T OPENED
YOUR MOUTH TO PETEY.

13:32.978 --> 13:35.848
FRANKIE, IT'S ME, JOEY.

13:35.915 --> 13:38.984
WHY YOU DOING
THIS, MAN ?

13:39.051 --> 13:41.153
C'MON, YOU KNOW
I WOULDN'T GIVE YOU UP.

13:41.220 --> 13:42.821
SHUT UP !

13:50.329 --> 13:52.464
WHAT'S HAPPENING,
OLD MAN ?

13:52.531 --> 13:54.466
THE PORTAL IS OPENING.

13:54.533 --> 13:57.503
PREPARING TO
RECEIVE A SOUL.

13:57.570 --> 14:00.739
STRANGE...
IT FEELS...

14:00.806 --> 14:03.242
FAMILIAR ?
YES.

14:03.309 --> 14:05.811
YOU YOURSELF
CAME THROUGH.

14:05.878 --> 14:07.580
YOU JUST
DON'T REMEMBER.

14:12.284 --> 14:15.487
I DON'T WANT TO
LOOK AT YOUR FACE.

14:18.991 --> 14:21.961
WHAT'S DONE
IS DONE, JOEY.

14:22.027 --> 14:24.230
( Spawn )
WHY DON'T YOU KILL
YOUR GOOD BUDDY

14:24.296 --> 14:26.065
SOMEWHERE ELSE ?

14:26.131 --> 14:29.768
I'M SICK OF SEEING
YOU PUNKS IN MY ALLEY.

14:29.835 --> 14:31.737
WHAT ARE YOU,
SOME KIND OF FREAK ?

14:31.804 --> 14:33.706
GET THE FUCK
OUTTA HERE !

14:38.143 --> 14:40.112
YOU'RE JUST
TAKING UP SPACE.

14:40.179 --> 14:42.147
BREATHING MY AIR.

14:42.214 --> 14:45.017
( Cogliostro )
THIS BOY WANTS
TO BE A KILLER.

14:45.084 --> 14:46.452
LIKE YOU...

14:46.518 --> 14:48.954
LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE
GONNA SHOW HIM HOW.

14:49.021 --> 14:51.557
I WANT YOU GONE.

14:51.624 --> 14:53.425
WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS, KID ?

14:53.492 --> 14:55.294
YOU DON'T OWE
THEM ANYTHING.

14:55.361 --> 14:56.862
YOU THINK I WANT
TO SHOOT HIM ?

14:56.929 --> 14:58.364
JOEY FUCKED UP.

14:58.430 --> 14:59.765
I BROUGHT HIM
IN FOR THIS,

14:59.832 --> 15:01.467
AND NOW THEY THINK
I'M A RAT TOO.

15:01.533 --> 15:02.668
THEY MADE ME.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.570
THIS ISN'T
MY FUCKING GUN.

15:04.637 --> 15:05.938
GET OUT !

15:06.005 --> 15:08.207
YOU THINK YOU CONTROL
WHAT GOES ON HERE ?

15:08.274 --> 15:09.341
YOU'RE DAMN RIGHT.

15:09.408 --> 15:12.911
YOU HAVE A LOT
TO LEARN, HELL SPAWN.

15:13.746 --> 15:15.214
IT'S TAKING
TOO LONG,

15:15.281 --> 15:17.383
MAYBE FRANKIE DIDN'T
HAVE THE GUTS.

15:17.449 --> 15:18.751
THEN THEY'RE
BOTH DEAD.

15:18.817 --> 15:20.586
YEAH, BOTH DEAD.

15:22.988 --> 15:25.057
( car engine starts )

15:33.132 --> 15:35.167
SHIT !

16:42.334 --> 16:44.303
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON ?

16:44.370 --> 16:47.506
AM I DEAD ?
AM I DREAMING ?

17:01.453 --> 17:03.322
WHAT, WHAT ?!

17:07.192 --> 17:09.628
NO, THERE'S
GOTTA BE A WAY.

17:10.763 --> 17:12.164
AM I BEING
PUNISHED ?

17:12.231 --> 17:14.199
IS THAT IT ?

17:29.214 --> 17:31.683
I CAN'T
BELIEVE THIS !

17:31.750 --> 17:34.153
WHAT'S HAPPENED ?
WHAT'S HAPPENED ?!

17:34.219 --> 17:36.021
THERE'S NO WAY OUT
FOR YOU, FRANKIE.

17:36.088 --> 17:38.090
THE BULLET WAITS.

17:38.157 --> 17:39.558
WHICH SIDE
ARE YOU ON ?

17:39.625 --> 17:42.327
I'M ON MY SIDE !

17:42.394 --> 17:45.697
MISTER, IN MY NEIGHBORHOOD
YOU TAKE CARE OF BUSINESS

17:45.764 --> 17:48.100
OR BUSINESS
TAKES CARE OF YOU.

17:48.167 --> 17:49.968
I DON'T HAVE
TO CHOOSE SHIT.

17:50.035 --> 17:52.738
NOW WHY DON'T YOU TWO
FAGGOTS GO FUCK OFF ?

17:59.912 --> 18:02.681
WHO IS THE REAL
EXECUTIONER HERE ?

18:02.748 --> 18:04.349
ANYONE WHO WOULD
MURDER HIS BEST FRIEND

18:04.416 --> 18:06.151
ISN'T WORTH
KEEPING ALIVE.

18:06.218 --> 18:08.187
YOU THINK HE'S
THE ONLY ONE

18:08.253 --> 18:11.056
WHO SACRIFICED
A FRIEND ?

18:11.123 --> 18:14.693
YOU HAD CHOICES
ABOUT KILLING,
TOO, HELL SPAWN.

18:14.760 --> 18:15.994
YOU'RE NO
BETTER THAN HIM.

18:16.061 --> 18:17.262
I WAS A SOLDIER,

18:17.329 --> 18:19.064
STUCK IN A LOT
OF DIRTY LITTLE WARS.

18:19.131 --> 18:20.732
I TOOK ORDERS.

18:20.799 --> 18:23.068
THIS KID IS JUST
TAKING ORDERS, TOO.

18:23.135 --> 18:25.103
HIS LIFE
DEPENDS ON IT.

18:25.170 --> 18:27.339
YOU REMEMBER YOUR
BUDDY, DON'T YOU ?

18:27.406 --> 18:29.908
THE FRIEND YOU SACRIFICED
IN THE JUNGLE ?

18:29.975 --> 18:31.677
WHAT DID YOU SAY ?

18:31.743 --> 18:34.379
YOU LET HIM DIE AT
THE HANDS OF THE ENEMY,

18:34.446 --> 18:36.682
WHILE YOU SURVIVED.

18:36.748 --> 18:38.417
I DON'T WANT YOU
IN MY HEAD, OLD MAN.

18:38.484 --> 18:41.353
DO YOU REMEMBER
YOUR FRIEND, SYKES ?

18:41.420 --> 18:43.622
SYKES...

18:49.528 --> 18:51.497
YOU COULD
HAVE SAVED HIM.

18:54.700 --> 18:56.502
YOUR POSITION,

18:56.568 --> 18:58.770
I WANT TO KNOW
YOUR UNIT'S POSITION.

18:58.837 --> 19:00.038
DON'T TELL HIM
ANYTHING, AL.

19:06.245 --> 19:08.046
HOW ABOUT YOU,
<i> MARICONE</i> ?

19:08.113 --> 19:09.214
WOULD YOU
LIKE TO LIVE ?

19:11.250 --> 19:12.417
DON'T TELL
THEM ANYTHING.

19:12.484 --> 19:13.819
OHH !

19:15.787 --> 19:17.322
SYKES.

19:17.389 --> 19:19.191
THEY'RE
COMING, MAN.

19:21.994 --> 19:23.595
AHHH !

19:26.431 --> 19:30.669
( Cogliostro )
IT TOOK HOURS BEFORE YOUR
FRIEND'S BODY STOPPED MOVING,

19:30.736 --> 19:33.171
THERE WAS THE SMELL
OF HIS BLOOD,

19:33.238 --> 19:36.708
THE SOUND OF THE MACHETE
HACKING THROUGH BONE.

19:36.775 --> 19:39.845
HIS MOANING WERE LITTLE
WHIMPERS BEFORE HE DIED.

19:39.912 --> 19:41.914
DO YOU REMEMBER
THOSE SOUNDS ?

19:41.980 --> 19:43.615
DO YOU REMEMBER
THE BLOOD ?

19:43.682 --> 19:45.017
HOW THICK ?

19:45.083 --> 19:46.585
YOUR FEET WERE
SLIDING ON IT.

19:46.652 --> 19:48.053
WHEN IT WAS
YOUR TURN,

19:48.120 --> 19:50.556
WHAT WAS THE ONLY THING
YOU COULD THINK OF ?

19:50.622 --> 19:52.558
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT THAT WAS ?

19:52.624 --> 19:57.129
THE ONE THING YOU WOULD
GIVE ANYTHING FOR...

19:57.195 --> 19:59.998
( Al )
YOU BETTER KILL ME.

20:02.701 --> 20:04.870
( Cogliostro )
DO YOU REMEMBER ?

20:11.443 --> 20:13.011
SECURE THE AREA.

20:13.078 --> 20:15.180
CUT OUR MEN
OFF THAT POLE.

20:15.247 --> 20:16.982
NOW !

20:20.953 --> 20:23.155
MAJOR FORSBERG, SIR.

20:23.221 --> 20:25.724
WE DIDN'T TELL THEM
ANYTHING, SIR.

20:27.526 --> 20:28.894
JESUS !

20:28.961 --> 20:31.129
ALL THE COORDINATES
WE GAVE YOU WERE BOGUS,

20:31.196 --> 20:32.931
IN CASE YOU
WERE CAPTURED.

20:49.881 --> 20:52.484
( Cogliostro )
DO YOU REMEMBER
WHAT YOU DID ?

20:52.551 --> 20:54.353
EVEN AFTER
YOU WERE RESCUED ?

21:24.182 --> 21:26.051
AHH !

21:30.589 --> 21:32.090
( gunshots )

21:34.092 --> 21:37.863
THEY'RE JUST WOMEN
AND CHILDREN, AL.

21:40.165 --> 21:42.367
DON'T GIVE
INTO THE DEMONS.

21:42.434 --> 21:44.670
I CAN GUIDE YOU
OUT OF HERE.

21:44.736 --> 21:46.805
LISTEN TO ME, AL.

21:46.872 --> 21:49.007
LOOK AT ME.

21:49.074 --> 21:51.410
DON'T LET THE
DEMONS TAKE YOU.

21:51.476 --> 21:53.578
YOU HEAR ME,
SOLDIER ?

21:53.645 --> 21:57.182
DON'T LET
THE DEMONS
TAKE YOU.

22:08.860 --> 22:10.729
( Cogliostro )
AND THE WAY YOU FELT ?

22:10.796 --> 22:12.731
YOU REMEMBER THAT,
DON'T YOU ?

22:12.798 --> 22:13.832
DON'T YOU !

22:15.067 --> 22:18.970
YES, YES !
IT FELT GOOD !

22:19.037 --> 22:21.773
I'M GLAD I KILLED
THE LITTLE PRICK.

22:21.840 --> 22:24.543
I SCATTERED HIS BRAINS
ALL OVER THE JUNGLE.

22:26.978 --> 22:28.947
( Cogliostro )
WHEN YOU PULLED
THAT TRIGGER

22:29.014 --> 22:33.018
YOU MADE THE EYES OF HELL
TURN TOWARD YOU THAT DAY.

22:33.085 --> 22:35.353
YOU MADE HELL
TAKE NOTICE.

22:35.420 --> 22:37.556
YOU'RE LYING.

22:37.622 --> 22:40.158
YOU DON'T KNOW
A DAMN THING ABOUT ME.

22:40.225 --> 22:41.860
YOU GAVE HELL
A NEW PLAYER.

22:41.927 --> 22:44.696
THAT MOMENT WAS
THE BEGINNING.

22:44.763 --> 22:47.532
YOU MADE THEM
LOOK AT YOU.

22:47.599 --> 22:49.401
CRAVE YOU.

22:49.468 --> 22:52.604
SPAWN WAS BORN
ON THAT DAY.

22:52.671 --> 22:57.275
THAT'S WHY THEY TURNED
ME INTO A MONSTER ?

22:57.342 --> 23:00.312
THEY PUT THE RIGHT FACE
ON YOU, HELL SPAWN.

23:00.378 --> 23:02.314
YOU'RE JUST LIKE
FRANKIE HERE.

23:02.380 --> 23:03.749
WHEN YOU WERE
STILL HUMAN

23:03.815 --> 23:05.550
YOU GAVE UP
YOUR HUMANITY.

23:05.617 --> 23:07.486
HEY, GRAMPS,

23:07.552 --> 23:10.522
THIS NIGHT OF THE
LIVING DEAD STUFF

23:10.589 --> 23:13.625
IS REALLY
FREAKING ME OUT.

23:13.692 --> 23:16.728
I DIDN'T
CHOOSE HELL.

23:16.795 --> 23:19.564
WHAT THE FUCK
AM I DOING ?

23:19.631 --> 23:21.133
TALKING TO A
BUM ABOUT HELL.

23:21.199 --> 23:23.068
THERE AIN'T NO HELL,
I GOTTA GET OUT OF HERE.

23:23.135 --> 23:25.337
YOU GET ME OUT
OF THIS GODDAMN FOG.

23:25.403 --> 23:29.274
NO, IT'S DONE,
TIME TO CHOOSE.

23:38.750 --> 23:41.052
THE TRIGGER HAS
ALREADY BEEN PULLED,

23:41.119 --> 23:43.889
THE TARGET CHOSEN.

23:59.037 --> 24:01.072
WHY ARE YOU
DOING THIS, FRANKIE ?

24:06.111 --> 24:08.180
DON'T, DON'T
SHOOT PETEY.

24:09.147 --> 24:11.449
WHAT'S IT GONNA
BE, FRANKIE ?

24:30.068 --> 24:32.103
YOU DID THE RIGHT
THING, FRANKIE.

24:32.170 --> 24:35.207
TONIGHT YOU
MADE YOUR BONES.

24:39.978 --> 24:41.646
IF YOU HAD KILLED HIM,

24:41.713 --> 24:45.083
MALEBOLGIA WOULD JUST
HAVE HAD MORE SOLDIERS.

24:45.150 --> 24:48.053
WHY DOES MALEBOLGIA PLAY
THESE LITTLE GAMES ?

24:48.119 --> 24:51.523
HE DIDN'T MAKE FRANKIE
PULL THAT TRIGGER.

24:51.590 --> 24:55.093
FRANKIE MADE THE CHOICE
TO BE A KILLER

24:55.160 --> 24:57.629
JUST LIKE YOU DID.

24:57.696 --> 25:00.065
HELL CAN'T
MAKE YOU CHOOSE.

25:00.131 --> 25:01.833
THEY DON'T HAVE
THAT POWER.

25:01.900 --> 25:03.768
YOU JUSTIFIED IT.

25:12.944 --> 25:15.847
I'M NOT BUYING INTO
YOUR LITTLE DRAMA,
OLD MAN.

25:15.914 --> 25:17.249
WHY ?

25:17.315 --> 25:19.718
BECAUSE YOU REFUSE
TO TRUST ME.

25:19.784 --> 25:22.988
THEN FIND
SOMEONE ELSE.

25:23.054 --> 25:25.657
THERE MUST HAVE BEEN
SOMEONE YOU BELIEVED IN,

25:25.724 --> 25:27.926
SOME TIME
IN YOUR LIFE.

25:29.728 --> 25:32.197
DON'T GIVE
INTO THE DEMONS.

25:33.365 --> 25:35.600
FORSBERG...
I TRUSTED HIM.

25:35.667 --> 25:38.003
HE WAS A ROCK.

25:38.069 --> 25:40.071
NOT ANYMORE.

25:45.810 --> 25:48.280
DON'T LET THE DEMONS
TAKE YOU.

25:48.346 --> 25:50.782
DON'T LET THE
DEMONS TAKE YOU.

25:50.849 --> 25:53.718
DON'T LET THE DEMONS...

25:53.785 --> 25:55.587
... THE DEMONS
TAKE YOU.

26:08.700 --> 26:10.135
AHH... !

26:20.812 --> 26:23.982
MAJOR FORSBERG,
HOW HAVE YOU BEEN ?

26:24.049 --> 26:26.885
I HOPE MY FRIENDS HAVE
BEEN TREATING YOU WELL.

26:30.555 --> 26:33.358
SHH...

26:33.425 --> 26:35.293
