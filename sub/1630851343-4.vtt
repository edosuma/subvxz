help you with that.

11:10.520 --> 11:11.770
[charley]<i> yes, yes.</i>

11:11.888 --> 11:14.689
<i> I am working with the</i> black
american farmers'<i> alliance,</i>

11:14.775 --> 11:17.425
<i> supporting legislation</i>
<i> to aid black farmers,</i>

11:17.527 --> 11:19.110
<i> who've suffered decades</i>

11:19.229 --> 11:21.596
<i> of discrimination by banks</i>
<i> and the usda.</i>

11:21.698 --> 11:23.815
<i> Due to discriminatory</i>
<i> policies,</i>

11:23.900 --> 11:27.619
<i> black folks make</i>
<i> up really only one percent</i>
<i> of farmers today,</i>

11:27.738 --> 11:30.488
<i> as opposed to 14 percent</i>
<i> 100 years ago.</i>

11:30.574 --> 11:35.627
Wow. So are you saying
that the black farmer in this
country is almost extinct?

11:35.746 --> 11:37.612
<i> This is true. Yeah.</i>

11:37.714 --> 11:39.714
<i> But it doesn't have</i>
<i> to be this way.</i>

11:39.800 --> 11:41.166
<i> Not if I have</i>
<i> anything to say about it.</i>

11:41.251 --> 11:43.718
We are listening to you,
charley bordelon. We hear you.

11:43.804 --> 11:46.388
-[charley laughs]
-you've become a local
political celebrity and now,

11:46.473 --> 11:48.890
the party leadership
is looking at you
for state office.

11:48.975 --> 11:51.626
Clearly, as a first step
towards a much brighter
political future,

11:51.728 --> 11:53.795
some say, like stacy abrams.

11:53.897 --> 11:58.316
Well, I'm honored that they've
even asked me to consider
running for state office.

11:58.435 --> 12:02.854
In fact, I'm actually here
in dc today for another
meeting with party leadership.

12:02.939 --> 12:06.491
<i> Well, where you are today</i>
<i> is a long way from that day</i>
<i> in the arena</i>

12:06.610 --> 12:08.493
<i> when you learned</i>
<i> of your husband's infidelity.</i>

12:08.612 --> 12:11.029
<i> We all watched as you</i>
<i> walked out on that court.</i>

12:11.114 --> 12:13.748
Many hearts broke
when we watched you that day.

12:13.834 --> 12:15.467
And now, there have
been recent photographs

12:15.585 --> 12:19.370
of the two of you together
in public, and I'm almost
hesitant to ask this question,

12:19.456 --> 12:22.290
but does this mean that you
and davis have reconciled?

12:23.260 --> 12:24.325
It's true.

12:24.428 --> 12:26.544
Davis and I have reconciled.

12:26.630 --> 12:28.263
How were you
able to do that?

12:28.348 --> 12:30.598
Because I'm thinking
it couldn't have been easy
to work through,

12:30.684 --> 12:32.851
<i> considering all</i>
<i> of the previous issues,</i>

12:32.969 --> 12:34.669
and scandals, some would say.

12:34.771 --> 12:36.337
Uh, well,
I would say it, too.

12:36.440 --> 12:41.693
Believe me. And I'll admit
we're a work in progress.

12:41.812 --> 12:45.330
But I have forgiven davis.
We're moving forward.

12:45.432 --> 12:48.767
<i> But in the court</i>
<i>of public opinion, he is still</i>
<i> not held in high regard.</i>

12:48.869 --> 12:50.618
<i> Do you think that the public</i>
<i> has forgiven him,</i>

12:50.704 --> 12:53.538
<i> and can he</i>
<i> truly move forward?</i>

12:57.144 --> 12:58.526
<i> Do you think that the public</i>
<i> has forgiven him?</i>

12:58.645 --> 13:00.395
<i> Can he truly move forward?</i>

13:00.480 --> 13:05.400
Davis doesn't believe
that he can make amends
with anything he says,

13:05.485 --> 13:07.318
but rather
by what he does.

13:07.404 --> 13:12.657
<i> Now, you and I, we both know</i>
<i>that he doesn't have the right</i>
<i>to ask that people forgive him</i>

13:12.742 --> 13:17.078
but he has asked me
to give him an opportunity

13:17.164 --> 13:19.581
to prove that
he's a changed man.

13:20.167 --> 13:21.583
And I've given him that.

13:21.668 --> 13:24.202
You're right,
he doesn't have the right
to ask that of you,

13:24.304 --> 13:27.088
but you say changed.
Changed, how so?

13:27.174 --> 13:30.508
<i> Well, he's,</i>
<i> he's doing the actual work</i>
<i> to make positive changes</i>

13:30.594 --> 13:32.543
<i> in his life</i>
<i> and in the lives of others.</i>

13:32.646 --> 13:36.898
<i> He donates extensively</i>
<i> to organizations</i>
<i> supporting children,</i>

13:37.017 --> 13:39.350
<i> and women,</i>
<i> including</i> me too
<i> and</i> time's<i> up.</i>

13:39.436 --> 13:40.885
Oh, that's a start.

13:40.987 --> 13:44.439
<i> But mostly,</i>
<i> he's trying to be</i>
<i> a good father to our,</i>

13:44.524 --> 13:46.724
<i> our son micah</i>
<i> and to his daughter, tia.</i>

13:46.827 --> 13:50.945
<i> He can't do much about his</i>
<i> past, but he's trying to</i>
<i> create a better future.</i>

13:51.031 --> 13:54.199
<i> Well, I'm glad to hear</i>
<i> that he's really owned up</i>
<i> to his mistakes,</i>

13:54.284 --> 13:57.068
<i> and that he is working</i>
<i> toward redemption.</i>

13:57.170 --> 13:59.621
Mm. You just...
You just said a key word.

14:00.540 --> 14:01.673
Work.

14:03.009 --> 14:05.260
We all fall down
at some point

14:05.378 --> 14:08.763
but I believe it's how
you get up that matters.

14:08.882 --> 14:12.100
<i> So when you think</i>
<i> of your recent trajectory</i>
<i> from basketball wife</i>

14:12.219 --> 14:16.754
<i> and talent manager to public</i>
<i> servant with serious</i>
<i> political aspirations,</i>

14:16.857 --> 14:22.410
<i>what would you say is a common</i>
<i> denominator for your success</i>
<i> in both of those areas?</i>

14:22.529 --> 14:24.312
Hm. Well...

14:25.565 --> 14:29.317
The word 'no' is my boomerang.
[laughs]

14:29.402 --> 14:33.071
<i> someone tells me no,</i>
<i> and I simply boomerang it</i>
<i> right back.</i>

14:33.156 --> 14:34.289
[laughs]
<i> yeah.</i>

14:34.407 --> 14:37.575
<i> -I answer their 'no'</i>
<i> with a 'no' of my own.</i>
-Yeah.

14:37.661 --> 14:40.662
<i> I just... I reject 'no'</i>
<i> for breakfast,</i>
<i> lunch and dinner.</i>

14:40.747 --> 14:44.048
<i> And that's, that's the common</i>
<i> denominator for me, gayle.</i>

14:45.252 --> 14:46.751
[isaiah] but you've
got to admit,

14:46.836 --> 14:49.620
garvey was on to something
when he said black folks
should go back to africa.

14:49.723 --> 14:52.640
The environment plays
the biggest part in cultural
development.

14:52.759 --> 14:54.809
-[micah] that's cool, but--
-but what?

14:54.928 --> 14:57.145
What better place
to get in touch with
your cultural identity

14:57.264 --> 14:58.296
than in the motherland?

14:58.398 --> 14:59.681
You're forgetting garvey's
stance on nationalism.

14:59.766 --> 15:02.600
You can still be
proud of your culture,
no matter where you live.

15:03.904 --> 15:05.603
I guess you're really
not trying to go anywhere,

15:05.689 --> 15:09.157
-'cause that's not what garvey
was talking about at all.
-Oh my god!

15:09.276 --> 15:10.775
You're here to stay then.

15:10.860 --> 15:14.279
You're just waiting
on america to give you
your 40 acres and a mule frat.

15:14.364 --> 15:15.663
That's not gonna
happen anytime soon.

15:15.782 --> 15:17.248
Look, it might,
but I don't know,

15:17.334 --> 15:19.784
the only way I'm staying here
is if we end some
of this police violence

15:19.869 --> 15:20.785
against black folks.

15:20.870 --> 15:22.203
Not some, all.

15:26.710 --> 15:31.095
Imagine what this world would
look like if it actually cared
about equality and freedom.

15:33.967 --> 15:35.300
I'll do you one better.

15:36.636 --> 15:38.720
I wonder
what it would feel like.

15:40.807 --> 15:44.158
Imagine you could just go
wherever you wanted to go,

15:44.260 --> 15:46.894
be with whoever
you wanted to be with,

15:46.980 --> 15:51.265
live where you wanted to live
without threat of violence
from police or anybody else.

15:53.320 --> 15:54.736
[sighs]

15:57.240 --> 16:00.508
-hey! A black man can dream,
can't he?
-[both chuckle]

16:00.627 --> 16:02.410
yeah, I guess we can.

16:02.512 --> 16:03.828
All right,
I gotta get out of here.

16:03.913 --> 16:05.813
Gotta pick up some flowers
for this girl I'm seeing.

16:05.915 --> 16:09.250
I don't think dr. Stetson
will look too kindly
on being called a girl.

16:12.172 --> 16:13.638
That's a grown woman.

16:16.009 --> 16:18.676
Yeah, like,
I know, because

16:18.762 --> 16:21.045
you get all red and nervous
whenever she's around,

16:21.147 --> 16:24.098
-and she looks at you
like she's gonna devour you.
-[micah] no.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.053
Don't tell anybody, okay?

16:29.155 --> 16:30.872
No brother,
I would never do that.

16:34.361 --> 16:36.911
Get the large bunch.
Don't be cheap.

16:37.030 --> 16:39.197
And, uh, you know,
maybe she'll give you an a+.

16:40.367 --> 16:42.233
-Or a little something extra.
-Man, shut up.

16:42.335 --> 16:43.785
-I'll see you later.
-[isaiah] see you.

16:47.123 --> 16:48.523
[walker] do we have
any other signs?

16:48.625 --> 16:52.794
Hey! Hey! Hey!
You can't come over here.
This area is a crime scene.

16:52.879 --> 16:54.578
[ralph] still my land,
you hear?

16:54.681 --> 16:56.580
I'm gonna go
wherever I wanna go.

16:56.683 --> 17:01.135
Hey, man,
your boys too close
to my mama's grave.

17:01.221 --> 17:03.721
That little warrant ain't said
you could go in that area.

17:03.807 --> 17:05.556
Show some damn respect, huh.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.429
[phone ringing]

17:30.667 --> 17:31.699
benny.

17:32.335 --> 17:33.551
Where you at?

17:34.921 --> 17:37.171
I have a bit of soil
that needs some testing.

17:38.091 --> 17:39.090
All right.

17:43.847 --> 17:45.613
[nova] glad you came by.

17:45.732 --> 17:50.518
I came because I left
our last conversation
unfinished,

17:50.603 --> 17:55.773
and I promised myself years
ago if I ever had the chance
to face my fear that I,

17:55.859 --> 17:57.825
I'd never run again.

17:57.927 --> 17:59.861
What is your fear
in this situation?

18:02.749 --> 18:04.198
Rejection.

18:04.284 --> 18:05.583
Again.

18:10.090 --> 18:12.590
I didn't know what you were
going through with jimmy dale.

18:13.626 --> 18:15.126
You didn't deserve that.

18:16.379 --> 18:18.212
My assumptions about it all.

18:18.765 --> 18:20.214
My silence.

18:22.102 --> 18:25.887
I've been thinking back
on that time, trying to
excavate my memories.

18:25.972 --> 18:29.190
Dig through all the years
of what I thought happened.

18:29.292 --> 18:31.959
It's funny of what the mind
takes hold of as truth.

18:32.061 --> 18:34.112
That might not be
the real whole truth.

18:36.566 --> 18:38.149
Well, the truth is...

18:39.319 --> 18:42.904
I was a teenager
lured to a secluded place

18:42.989 --> 18:46.707
by a grown man
who wanted what he wanted.

18:46.826 --> 18:51.212
I was flattered by
the attention until I figured
out where it was going.

18:51.331 --> 18:54.365
And I got out of there
as fast as I could.

18:54.467 --> 18:58.002
Thank god I was able
to claw myself away
before anything happened.

18:59.672 --> 19:01.139
But it didn't matter.

19:02.342 --> 19:04.392
'cause he said what he said.

19:04.511 --> 19:08.379
And violet, you,

19:08.481 --> 19:11.098
my own father
and this whole town
believed it.

19:13.336 --> 19:14.936
My word was nothing

19:15.855 --> 19:17.271
to anyone.

19:18.358 --> 19:20.174
You were someone to me.

19:21.344 --> 19:23.444
You were my best friend.

19:23.546 --> 19:26.864
I was young and uneducated
about assault and abuse

19:26.950 --> 19:28.115
and the world
outside of st. Jo.

19:28.201 --> 19:31.669
I believed what everyone else
believed at the time and...

19:33.206 --> 19:34.705
I'm sorry, billie.

19:35.542 --> 19:37.375
I let you down then.

19:39.546 --> 19:41.345
I won't let you down now.

19:42.549 --> 19:44.048
I'm sorry.

19:50.190 --> 19:52.773
So, what made you
wanna test the soil?

19:54.110 --> 19:56.093
I don't know
what they doing.

19:56.196 --> 19:58.863
They could be
putting something in
instead of taking it out.

19:59.482 --> 20:01.432
Poison. Pesticide.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.484
I don't know,
but I don't trust them.

20:04.571 --> 20:07.321
You need a baseline.
See what's already out there.

20:09.242 --> 20:10.992
You're really smart.

20:11.794 --> 20:13.127
Do you know that?

20:14.080 --> 20:15.379
What you talking about?

20:15.465 --> 20:18.599
It's true.
I mean your mind,
the way it works.

20:18.701 --> 20:21.035
Your intelligence
about the land.

20:21.137 --> 20:23.588
You're always reading,
always learning.

20:24.474 --> 20:26.173
It's quite amazing.

20:27.060 --> 20:28.809
Well, you learn everyday.

20:30.179 --> 20:31.145
Thank you.

20:31.247 --> 20:33.147
Of course. It's true.

20:35.768 --> 20:38.069
However,

20:38.154 --> 20:41.155
the entire load of the land
should not be on you.

20:42.775 --> 20:44.992
I found something
that I think could help.

20:45.662 --> 20:47.495
What you talking about?

20:47.597 --> 20:50.781
When I was pulling out
all of the scholarship
paperwork for blue,

20:50.867 --> 20:53.501
I discovered a student account

20:54.671 --> 20:56.287
from when I was in college.

20:57.290 --> 20:59.340
Some of it's, you know,
a combination of

20:59.459 --> 21:01.425
student scholarship money
and a college fund

21:01.511 --> 21:03.878
that my parents
had been saving for me.

21:04.681 --> 21:07.248
It's administered to them

21:07.350 --> 21:10.935
and I would like to ask them
to send it over to me.

21:11.721 --> 21:13.521
That was college, darla.

21:13.640 --> 21:18.776
Yeah, I mean, I didn't
finish, unfortunately,
and it's just sitting there.

21:18.861 --> 21:23.197
I wanted you to know
that I'm not asking
them for money.

21:23.316 --> 21:25.283
That's the money that
was already put aside for me.

21:25.368 --> 21:28.152
And honestly,
I don't even think they'd even
remember it's there.

21:28.988 --> 21:30.237
Hmm.

21:31.824 --> 21:33.641
We need it.

21:33.743 --> 21:35.660
The harvest didn't bring in
as much as we thought.

21:35.745 --> 21:38.129
These payday loans
aren't going away.

21:38.214 --> 21:39.863
I don't want to get
into more trouble
than we're already in.

21:39.966 --> 21:41.332
I don't like it.

21:41.417 --> 21:44.368
I don't want your mama
thinking we can't take care
of ourselves.

21:44.470 --> 21:46.921
And I for sure don't want her
talkin' to aunt vi.

21:50.760 --> 21:52.560
Can we just wait on it?

21:52.679 --> 21:54.895
Look, it ain't
even a bad idea.

21:55.014 --> 21:56.647
I just need
a little more time.

21:56.733 --> 21:59.150
I know, but how are we
gonna pay for the doula?

21:59.235 --> 22:02.069
The midwife?
Baby needs?

22:03.239 --> 22:05.906
-Those extras--
-I know how much
everything costs.

22:08.161 --> 22:10.861
Look, I'm gonna do
what I gotta do
to take care of my family.

22:13.499 --> 22:15.032
You just need to trust me.

22:15.118 --> 22:16.500
Please.

22:17.170 --> 22:18.452
[loud thud]

22:22.675 --> 22:24.375
that's what I'm talking about.

22:24.460 --> 22:26.327
Always something
with these people.

22:28.931 --> 22:29.930
[violet]<i> doing better baby?</i>

22:30.049 --> 22:32.583

Well, that she is.

22:41.561 --> 22:43.477
But give the nurse a chance.

22:43.946 --> 22:45.095
It might work out.

Yeah, forget the nurse.
I need a good meal.

Can you bring me
something by?

Well, I can't do nothing
about a nurse, but I can
make sure you eat.

How about some greens
and fried chicken?
That sound good?

It's meditation.

36:18.477 --> 36:20.026
Make sure
everything's all right.

36:20.145 --> 36:21.311

36:21.396 --> 36:22.662

all of the activists.

36:34.793 --> 36:36.159
Are you gonna be okay?

36:36.245 --> 36:37.544
I knew the risk.

36:37.663 --> 36:38.578
I'll take a couple
of days off.

36:38.664 --> 36:40.664
Out of sight,
out of mind.

36:40.749 --> 36:41.748
Maybe you should do the same.
