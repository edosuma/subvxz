WEBVTT

02:12.757 --> 02:15.635
Dad! Dad! Dad!

02:15.718 --> 02:18.429
It burns! Aah!

02:19.097 --> 02:21.015
Dad! No!

02:25.937 --> 02:26.938
Eli?

02:32.569 --> 02:33.570
Eli?

02:35.488 --> 02:36.531
Are you okay?

02:39.450 --> 02:40.910
Had the same dream.

02:41.744 --> 02:43.955
The one where you thought you were cured?

02:45.748 --> 02:46.749
Yeah.

02:47.834 --> 02:50.837
You will be, honey.
That's why we're doing this.

02:51.754 --> 02:53.882
Just one more drive to go, okay?

02:55.925 --> 02:57.635
-Promise?
-Promise.

02:58.887 --> 03:00.430
We'll be there before sunset.

03:01.431 --> 03:02.891
I mean about being cured.

03:04.100 --> 03:05.268
Cross my heart.

03:08.646 --> 03:10.273
You know I love you, right?

03:13.526 --> 03:14.777
I know.

04:05.453 --> 04:07.413
Also declined.

04:07.497 --> 04:08.498
What's that?

04:08.581 --> 04:09.749
Declined.

04:15.505 --> 04:16.756
That's all I got.

04:21.427 --> 04:24.389
Three people, two nights? That's 240.

04:25.139 --> 04:26.599
We stayed one night.

04:33.731 --> 04:34.816
Nice watch.

04:36.985 --> 04:39.362
Let's go. Burning daylight.

04:39.445 --> 04:40.446
We're ready.

04:42.365 --> 04:43.366
Come on, honey.

04:49.497 --> 04:51.749
Holy shit, dude. Check that out.

04:51.833 --> 04:54.043
-What the fresh fuck is that?
-Ha ha ha ha ha.

04:54.794 --> 04:56.921
Houston, we have a problem.

04:57.839 --> 05:00.758
Hey, spaceman,
what planet are you from--Uranus?

05:00.842 --> 05:02.593
- Uranus.

05:03.886 --> 05:05.805
-Eli.

05:06.723 --> 05:09.517
Come here... honey. Ah. It's me.

05:09.600 --> 05:11.644
- It's okay.

05:12.645 --> 05:15.064
Mom. Mom, it's ripped. Mom, it's--

05:15.148 --> 05:17.317
It's ripped. Get the tape.

05:17.400 --> 05:20.194
-It's okay. I got him
- He's gonna pass out.

05:21.779 --> 05:23.740
- Eli, you're okay. I got it.

05:23.823 --> 05:25.241
Breathe, Eli.

05:26.075 --> 05:28.870
-I'm sorry.
-Eli, calm down. Take it easy.

05:28.953 --> 05:32.707
Breathe, honey.
Eli, look at me. I'm right here.

05:35.084 --> 05:38.421
Real tough, assholes,
picking on a sick kid.

05:38.504 --> 05:41.049
Don't look at them.
It's just you and me, okay?

05:41.799 --> 05:45.678
Hey, don't look at them.
Look at me, okay? Breathe.

05:45.762 --> 05:47.764
- Go grow up.
-Breathe, honey.

05:47.847 --> 05:50.350
Can you smell that birthday cake
fresh from the oven?

05:51.184 --> 05:53.353
-All right, breathe in. Smell it?

05:54.020 --> 05:56.898
Blow out those candles.
Purse your lips.

05:57.482 --> 05:59.400
-That's it. Good.

06:00.109 --> 06:02.528
There's a couple more left. Blow 'em out.

06:03.738 --> 06:05.531
-That's good.

06:09.077 --> 06:10.203
Now make a wish.

06:15.750 --> 06:17.377
What did you wish for?

06:19.003 --> 06:21.214
I wish I could beat the crap out of them.

06:24.008 --> 06:25.134
Make another wish.

06:26.636 --> 06:28.388
That Dr. Horn can fix me.

06:35.269 --> 06:36.854
Should we get out of here?

06:38.648 --> 06:40.024
-Come on.
-See ya, man.

06:40.108 --> 06:41.776
-Blast off.
-Yeah.

06:43.069 --> 06:44.529
Bye.

06:48.825 --> 06:50.493
-Shit.

06:51.494 --> 06:52.537
Asshole.

07:26.863 --> 07:30.366
-Piece of shit.
-The old car never did that.

07:30.450 --> 07:32.869
I wasn't talking about the car.
I was talking about you.

07:32.952 --> 07:33.953
Paul.

07:36.122 --> 07:39.125
What? He knows I'm kidding.

07:39.208 --> 07:42.420
But we did need to tighten our belts
to get you to this doctor, pal.

07:44.088 --> 07:45.131
I know.

07:45.214 --> 07:48.926
Well, she's gonna be worth every penny.

07:49.010 --> 07:52.221
She's a miracle worker. Right?

07:56.809 --> 07:59.979
-Are you gonna show me my card or not?
-Oh.

08:01.355 --> 08:02.356
Is...

08:03.274 --> 08:04.484
this your card?

08:06.027 --> 08:07.236
That is my card.

08:08.279 --> 08:09.280
How'd you do that?

08:09.989 --> 08:13.034
It's not your card. You're lying to me
to make me feel better.

08:13.117 --> 08:17.038
Calm down. I wouldn't lie to you,
baby. Right, Paul?

08:18.289 --> 08:19.874
-He's nervous.
-I know.

08:24.295 --> 08:25.546
I miss DC.

09:03.626 --> 09:05.419
Is this where we're staying?

09:05.503 --> 09:06.921
-It is, buddy.
-Yep.

09:07.630 --> 09:08.881
Just for a little while.

09:28.901 --> 09:30.486
Hey, get your stuff. Let's go.

09:49.297 --> 09:50.631
Where's the doorbell?

09:50.715 --> 09:51.757
I don't know.

10:00.766 --> 10:03.894
<i>Welcome, Miller family. This is Dr. Horn.</i>

10:03.978 --> 10:06.814
<i>In order to protect</i>
<i>the integrity of the house,</i>

10:06.897 --> 10:11.485
<i>the decontamination chamber</i>
<i>is our only way in or out.</i>

10:11.569 --> 10:15.114
<i>Eli, will you please enter first</i>
<i>by yourself?</i>

10:15.698 --> 10:16.991
We'll be right behind you.

10:18.200 --> 10:20.578
-You're okay.
- You got this.

10:46.729 --> 10:49.065
<i>-Raise your arms, please.</i>

11:21.472 --> 11:23.683
Hello, Eli. I'm Dr. Horn.

11:27.019 --> 11:29.397
-Hello.

11:34.777 --> 11:35.778
Rose.

11:37.238 --> 11:38.114
Paul.

11:38.197 --> 11:40.741
-Nice to meet you in the flesh finally.
- Dr. Horn.

11:41.575 --> 11:44.954
-These are my nurses--Barbara, Maricela.
- Pleased to meet you.

11:45.037 --> 11:46.330
Did you find the place okay?

11:46.414 --> 11:48.833
- Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Miller.
-Call me Rose.

11:48.916 --> 11:51.836
We're so happy to have you out here.
You're in good hands.

11:51.919 --> 11:53.462
-I know.
-It's so lovely here.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.923
I find the isolation
is good for the soul.

11:56.632 --> 11:57.842
Excuse me.

12:03.305 --> 12:05.015
You can take your suit off now.

12:05.891 --> 12:06.767
You're safe.

12:07.309 --> 12:09.770
-What if there are contaminates?
-There aren't any.

12:10.646 --> 12:11.981
This is a clean house.

12:17.987 --> 12:20.322
-He's a little shy.
-There's no rush.

12:20.406 --> 12:23.826
You have to trust yourself first.
Will you fetch the Millers' luggage?

12:23.909 --> 12:25.202
-Right away.
-Absolutely.

12:25.286 --> 12:27.580
Please, follow me.
I'll show you your room.

12:29.540 --> 12:32.793
- How long will it take?
-The treatment? We do it in three stages.

12:32.877 --> 12:34.962
It's called Viral Gene Therapy.

12:35.045 --> 12:38.758
You see, your immune system produces
too many bad immunoglobulin--

12:38.841 --> 12:41.218
My body carries
a defective RAG1-RAG2 gene.

12:41.886 --> 12:44.138
Which we can correct
using an encoded virus.

12:44.221 --> 12:46.807
-You really know your stuff.
-I read.

12:46.891 --> 12:50.227
Rose and Paul, you'll be on this floor,
but we're gonna go to Eli's room first.

12:50.311 --> 12:51.771
Can't he sleep with us?

12:51.854 --> 12:55.399
Unfortunately, our patients must be
in their own rooms for treatment.

12:55.483 --> 12:58.778
-How long have you been a doctor?
-I've been an immunologist for 25 years,

12:58.861 --> 13:01.280
but I started this clean house
three years ago.

13:01.363 --> 13:03.157
How many patients have you treated?

13:03.240 --> 13:04.450
Quite a few.

13:04.533 --> 13:05.910
And you've cured all of them?

13:07.161 --> 13:08.162
Hmm?

13:10.206 --> 13:11.874
And you've cured all of them?

13:11.957 --> 13:15.878
Eli, I know you're nervous,
but you don't need to be.

13:15.961 --> 13:17.838
I will make you better.

13:21.634 --> 13:24.929
Don't worry about that.
That's the sound of the air filtration.

13:25.012 --> 13:27.389
Sometimes it makes the old piping vibrate.

13:27.473 --> 13:29.600
This is an old house.

13:29.683 --> 13:33.521
It had been abandoned for God knows
how long before I bought it. Shall we?

13:35.689 --> 13:37.191
What's down there?

13:37.274 --> 13:40.736
Not all of the house had been retrofitted
to be a clean environment.

13:41.612 --> 13:43.864
But don't worry. These seals are airtight.

13:46.242 --> 13:47.409
Shall we continue?

13:52.373 --> 13:53.374
Eli.

13:58.212 --> 13:59.505
This is your room, Eli.

14:26.031 --> 14:27.658
I know it's a lot to get used to,

14:27.741 --> 14:30.411
but I hope you don't think of this
as a medical facility.

14:31.412 --> 14:33.956
To me it's a home,
and for now, it's your home.

14:37.084 --> 14:38.502
Is the water safe?

14:43.132 --> 14:46.427
The water here is completely filtered,
purer than bottled water.

14:47.219 --> 14:49.263
Probably a long time
since you've had a shower.

14:52.474 --> 14:54.268
You can trust Dr. Horn, honey.

15:35.017 --> 15:37.436
Breathe.

15:38.479 --> 15:39.647
It's okay to breathe.

15:40.940 --> 15:41.941
It's okay.

15:45.110 --> 15:46.153
That's it.

16:03.879 --> 16:05.005
Oh, it's been so long.

16:07.132 --> 16:08.425
I love you.

16:09.051 --> 16:10.052
I know.

16:13.138 --> 16:14.515
Mwah.

16:51.593 --> 16:52.594
Where'd you get that?

16:52.678 --> 16:55.389
It's for him to wear
when we go home. Do you like it?

16:59.101 --> 17:02.021
Did you see his face
when he took off the suit?

17:03.188 --> 17:04.857
He was so happy.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.151
You remember?

17:08.193 --> 17:10.029
Happy? Hmm?

17:10.988 --> 17:13.615
-I just got a lot on my mind.
-I know.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.160
But this is gonna work.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.581
Everything we hoped for.

17:22.082 --> 17:24.209
Everything I prayed for is right here.

17:28.213 --> 17:29.465
He's gonna get better.

17:30.549 --> 17:32.009
We just gotta have faith.

17:34.344 --> 17:35.387
I do.

17:36.722 --> 17:39.016
I've always been a faithful man.

18:27.689 --> 18:28.690
Hi.

18:30.901 --> 18:32.152
Do you want to come in?

19:08.981 --> 19:09.982
Eli?

19:15.946 --> 19:17.781
My God, you're shaking.

19:19.741 --> 19:21.451
Can I sleep in your bed tonight?

19:49.646 --> 19:51.815
Good morning, Eli. How are you feeling?

19:52.608 --> 19:55.360
-Okay.
- I heard you didn't sleep well.

19:59.406 --> 20:01.491
There was something in my room.

20:01.575 --> 20:03.785
-What was it?
-I don't know.

20:03.869 --> 20:07.414
Like... breathing on the window?

20:09.333 --> 20:10.834
Were you asleep or awake?

20:11.752 --> 20:12.753
Awake.

20:13.545 --> 20:14.546
I think.

20:15.714 --> 20:19.259
Bad dreams are a side effect of
the immunosuppressants you're taking.

20:19.343 --> 20:22.596
I've even had some patients hallucinate.
It's perfectly normal.

20:23.513 --> 20:24.932
Shall we begin?

20:44.993 --> 20:45.994
You're not coming?

20:48.747 --> 20:49.748
Mom?

20:49.831 --> 20:51.792
We have to stay here, honey?

20:51.875 --> 20:54.169
We won't move from this spot. Promise.

20:59.341 --> 21:00.342
Eli.

21:02.010 --> 21:03.428
Why don't you make a wish?

21:11.228 --> 21:12.354
What'd you wish for?

21:14.690 --> 21:16.191
That I was brave.

21:17.985 --> 21:19.236
You already are.

21:36.044 --> 21:37.045
Just this way.

21:37.713 --> 21:38.714
Hmm.

21:51.476 --> 21:52.644
Stand there.

21:53.979 --> 21:55.063
Stand there.

21:56.648 --> 21:57.816
Hands in the air.

22:02.904 --> 22:06.199
<i>Seis, sesenta y seis.</i>

22:06.283 --> 22:07.284
Arms out.

22:09.328 --> 22:10.329
Turn around.

22:11.580 --> 22:12.581
Wait.

22:19.546 --> 22:22.049
<i>Vírese,</i> Eli. Face this way.

22:24.217 --> 22:25.761
Why are you taking my picture?

22:25.844 --> 22:27.763
-<i>Listo.</i>

22:28.305 --> 22:29.389
Where are you from?

22:31.975 --> 22:35.187
Do you know what happened to the boy
who asked too many questions?

22:37.022 --> 22:38.315
He got answers?

22:46.531 --> 22:47.532
Stations.

23:11.431 --> 23:13.809
So when did this all start, Eli?

23:13.892 --> 23:15.268
About four years ago.

23:16.395 --> 23:17.604
But it's much worse now.

23:18.688 --> 23:21.108
My patients are all just like you.

23:21.191 --> 23:22.651
All with failing immune systems.

23:23.693 --> 23:26.363
The condition remains dormant
until around your age.

23:28.573 --> 23:30.659
What do you think is making you sick?

23:30.742 --> 23:31.743
Needle.

23:33.662 --> 23:34.704
Lots of things.

23:35.497 --> 23:37.541
The air, water.

23:39.918 --> 23:42.379
-Dust.
-Could be those things.

23:43.338 --> 23:44.923
Could be something else.

23:45.757 --> 23:48.468
Because what is an autoimmune syndrome
at its core?

23:52.305 --> 23:54.224
It's the body fighting itself, right?

23:55.308 --> 23:56.810
In a normal, healthy body,

23:56.893 --> 23:59.563
antibodies are produced by stem cells
in the marrow.

24:00.105 --> 24:02.691
But in your body, that gene is impaired,

24:02.774 --> 24:06.736
so I'm gonna take this modified virus
and inject it into the marrow.

24:06.820 --> 24:11.408
This virus is gonna repair that gene
and reset your entire immune system.

24:11.491 --> 24:13.827
Poof. Like a magic trick.

24:14.703 --> 24:15.704
Right?

24:37.726 --> 24:38.727
Scalpel.

24:45.609 --> 24:46.610
Bone punch.

24:51.281 --> 24:53.575
So, I want you to count back from 100.

24:55.452 --> 24:56.453
One hundred...

24:58.079 --> 24:59.122
Ninety-nine...

25:01.958 --> 25:03.001
Ninety-eight...

25:04.586 --> 25:06.505
-Keep counting.

25:07.339 --> 25:08.381
Ninety-seven...

25:10.425 --> 25:11.426
Ninety-six...

25:13.345 --> 25:14.346
Ninety-five...

25:16.848 --> 25:18.725
-Ninety-four...

25:19.976 --> 25:21.770
Ninety-three...

25:24.356 --> 25:26.691
Ninety-two...

25:33.490 --> 25:34.658
What-What...

25:52.217 --> 25:55.387
Dr. Horn? Dr. Horn, let me go.

25:55.470 --> 25:56.555
I can't do that, Eli.

25:56.638 --> 25:59.432
Dr. Horn, it burns.

25:59.516 --> 26:02.894
-That's the medication.
-No! No, it really burns.

26:02.978 --> 26:04.396
That means it's working.

26:18.451 --> 26:20.078
No!

26:20.161 --> 26:22.163
Aah!

28:30.709 --> 28:31.960
Boo!

28:32.043 --> 28:34.170
Ha ha ha.

28:34.254 --> 28:36.798
Ah. I shouldn't have done that.

28:36.881 --> 28:40.218
-What, with you being sick and all.
-How do you know I'm sick?

28:40.802 --> 28:42.303
Well, you're in there, aren't you?

28:43.179 --> 28:44.639
That's where all of you stay.

28:44.723 --> 28:46.975
They say you're what, like,
allergic to the world, right?

28:48.893 --> 28:50.353
I-I guess you could say that.

28:50.437 --> 28:52.313
So you've never been outside?

28:52.397 --> 28:55.650
No, I have. I mean,
I wasn't born like this.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.736
My mom-My mom told me
I was a tough birth.

28:57.819 --> 29:02.574
She was sick a lot when I was pregnant.
Er, um, when she was pregnant, but...

29:02.657 --> 29:05.785
-I was fine until recently--
-You tell everybody your life story?

29:06.703 --> 29:07.704
Uh...

29:08.788 --> 29:10.915
You're cute. I'm Haley.

29:10.999 --> 29:12.459
I live down the road.

29:13.293 --> 29:15.462
-I'm Eli.
-You're what?

29:15.545 --> 29:18.089
Eli. My name's Eli.

29:20.800 --> 29:23.762
No, I don't like it.
I want to call you something else.

29:24.637 --> 29:27.432
What are you into? What do you like to do?

29:27.515 --> 29:30.477
Um, I like magic--card tricks.

29:31.394 --> 29:33.605
Card tricks? Wow.

29:33.980 --> 29:36.274
No. No, look.

29:38.401 --> 29:39.402
Hold on a sec.

29:41.029 --> 29:42.030
Uh...

29:43.323 --> 29:45.658
Look. Pick a card, any card.

29:47.744 --> 29:49.954
Wait. So I pick a card and then-

29:50.038 --> 29:53.416
and then what, you're gonna, like,
guess what card I picked?

29:54.959 --> 29:57.420
-Uh...
-Hey, you want to see a real trick?

29:59.506 --> 30:02.217
I can light this twig on fire
with my mind.

30:03.843 --> 30:05.428
Don't believe me? Watch.

30:10.433 --> 30:12.143
You scared of fire?

30:12.227 --> 30:14.979
Uh... no.

30:17.106 --> 30:20.610
I used to be scared of fire,
then I learned how to master it.

30:22.779 --> 30:23.947
Where's the match?

30:25.406 --> 30:26.658
What match?

30:26.741 --> 30:29.369
Come on. It's what you were doing
when you turned around.

30:29.452 --> 30:31.371
You hid it in your palm
and then distracted me.

30:31.454 --> 30:33.665
A good magician never reveals her secrets.

30:33.748 --> 30:35.208
Come on, tell me.

30:35.291 --> 30:37.043
What's the fun in that?

30:37.126 --> 30:39.671
Some things you just got to
figure out on your own.

30:41.172 --> 30:42.257
Anyway, I got to go.

30:43.049 --> 30:44.217
-Wait.

30:44.926 --> 30:47.220
I could ask my parents
if you could come inside.

30:48.346 --> 30:50.765
In there? No, thanks.

30:51.307 --> 30:52.308
Why not?

30:55.311 --> 30:57.856
Look, I don't mean
to freak you out, but...

30:58.606 --> 31:02.318
there's just something... off
about the whole place.

31:02.986 --> 31:04.195
Gives me the creeps.

31:05.530 --> 31:07.532
Actually, I'm not even
supposed to be here.

31:08.533 --> 31:11.744
The woman that runs this place,
she doesn't like me.

31:12.579 --> 31:15.623
I don't like her either. She's... shifty.

31:16.291 --> 31:17.333
Shifty?

31:18.751 --> 31:20.753
It's just better
if you don't say anything.

31:23.214 --> 31:24.549
See you later, Houdini.

32:44.212 --> 32:45.546
What are you doing?

32:46.589 --> 32:49.217
You can't wander this place by yourself.

32:53.304 --> 32:54.597
Put this back in your hand.

33:01.604 --> 33:03.147
Where did she go?

33:03.231 --> 33:04.357
Who?

33:10.113 --> 33:11.114
Dear Lord...

33:12.198 --> 33:14.993
we are thankful for everything
that you have given us...

33:15.785 --> 33:19.247
and for this time that
we get to spend together as a family.

33:20.790 --> 33:24.544
And especially for placing Dr. Horn
in our paths.

33:24.627 --> 33:26.421
In Jesus' name, amen.

33:26.504 --> 33:27.505
Amen.

33:37.682 --> 33:39.308
Something on your mind, honey?

33:39.392 --> 33:41.310
He's upset because I yelled at him.

33:42.395 --> 33:44.981
I said I was sorry, but he needs to
put that drip back in his hand.

33:45.064 --> 33:47.400
He won't believe me
that I saw someone in the hallway.

33:47.483 --> 33:50.570
-There's another kid in this house.
-Probably one of the nurses.

33:50.653 --> 33:52.363
It wasn't a nurse!

33:53.281 --> 33:54.824
Eli.

33:54.907 --> 33:56.409
Honey.

33:56.492 --> 33:57.577
Calm down, okay?

33:58.411 --> 33:59.412
Calm down.

34:00.955 --> 34:02.248
It was another patient.

34:02.331 --> 34:04.542
Honey, I'm scared, too.

34:04.625 --> 34:07.670
I am. I get scared of new places,
new people sometimes,

34:07.754 --> 34:10.840
but for you, it must be so overwhelming.

34:12.175 --> 34:13.676
On your body and your mind.

34:14.594 --> 34:18.681
But there is nobody else here
except us. I promise.

34:28.024 --> 34:29.150
Here. I got it.

34:33.988 --> 34:35.073
Right.

34:35.865 --> 34:36.866
Eat up.

34:42.371 --> 34:45.208
-Looks like shit.
-Tastes like shit, too.

35:03.976 --> 35:05.103
I knew it.

35:06.562 --> 35:09.273
"For best results,
practice in a dark place."

36:00.908 --> 36:01.993
Who are you?

37:15.900 --> 37:16.901
Aah!

37:39.715 --> 37:43.594
No! No, no! No! No!

37:49.058 --> 37:50.726
Eli, Eli! Listen to me!

37:50.810 --> 37:52.228
-Shh.
-No!

37:52.311 --> 37:54.146
It's Dad. Shh. Shh. Shh.

37:54.855 --> 37:57.400
-Honey.
-Hey, listen to me. Shh. Shh. Shh.

37:57.483 --> 37:59.527
-Hey.
-Paul, do something!

37:59.610 --> 38:02.363
-Do what?
-No! No! No!

38:02.446 --> 38:04.198
Breathe. Breathe.

38:04.282 --> 38:07.702
Breathe. Just breathe. Just breathe.
Just breathe. Just--

38:24.552 --> 38:26.429
It's, uh, it's the medication.

38:27.388 --> 38:30.141
Maybe you could lower the dosage
or something.

38:30.224 --> 38:32.435
I mean, if he's seeing things, I mean...

38:32.518 --> 38:34.437
-We put everything on the line for this.
-I know.

38:34.520 --> 38:35.396
Everything.

38:35.479 --> 38:38.065
-He was terrified, Paul.
-Okay, let her do her job.

38:38.149 --> 38:40.568
I-I'm-I'm not gonna sugarcoat this.

38:40.651 --> 38:43.863
What we're doing here
is very hard on Eli's body,

38:43.946 --> 38:46.449
and some of
the symptoms from his condition

38:46.532 --> 38:47.992
are bound to flare up,

38:48.075 --> 38:49.952
but we need to stay the course
of the medication,

38:50.036 --> 38:52.413
especially with Procedure Two.

38:52.496 --> 38:53.789
Why? What do you mean?

38:54.999 --> 38:57.418
Eli's gonna get worse
before he gets better.

39:08.971 --> 39:09.972
Hey.

39:12.141 --> 39:13.434
Be strong, sweetheart.

39:13.517 --> 39:14.602
We're right here.

39:40.711 --> 39:43.839
Good news, Eli. We spent the night
working on your stem cells,

39:43.923 --> 39:46.801
and we can confirm
that the gene therapy virus

39:46.884 --> 39:48.177
is correcting the mutation.

39:52.223 --> 39:55.101
This is gonna burn a little bit.
On the count of three.

39:56.977 --> 39:58.521
One, two...

40:02.608 --> 40:04.443
It'll be over before you know it.

40:04.527 --> 40:06.195
-Remain calm.
-It burns.

40:06.278 --> 40:08.114
It hurts!

40:09.949 --> 40:12.868
Aah! Aah, it burns!

40:13.619 --> 40:16.455
Breathe. This is supposed to happen.

40:21.502 --> 40:24.422
Unfortunately, the virus
that's gonna cure your affliction

40:24.505 --> 40:26.674
is unable to cross
the blood-brain barrier,

40:26.757 --> 40:28.050
so we have to penetrate.

40:28.926 --> 40:30.010
Drill.

40:31.220 --> 40:32.221
Relax.

40:32.304 --> 40:34.765
-Stress will make your symptoms worse.

40:44.024 --> 40:47.987
You're gonna be fine.
You will be.

40:48.070 --> 40:50.072
Jesus, look over my son...

40:51.907 --> 40:53.993
give him the strength to get through this.

40:54.702 --> 40:56.996
You really think praying's gonna help us?

41:02.793 --> 41:05.880
-How is he?
-He had a bit of a reaction today.

41:05.963 --> 41:07.339
A reaction?

41:07.423 --> 41:08.924
Yes. It's quite common.

41:09.008 --> 41:12.511
His body's gonna reject the new cells
just like any transplant. Okay?

41:12.595 --> 41:13.554
Can I see him?

41:15.389 --> 41:16.807
After he's had some rest.

41:24.482 --> 41:25.483
Thank you.

41:33.532 --> 41:35.242
Dr. Horn told me how strong you were--

41:35.326 --> 41:37.286
-There's something shifty about her.
-Shifty?

41:37.369 --> 41:38.370
What?

41:39.872 --> 41:43.542
-I think she's making me sicker.
-No, she's not, Eli. It's the medication--

41:43.626 --> 41:46.670
I know what I saw, Mom,
and it's not the medication.

41:46.754 --> 41:49.006
And if it was, then why do I feel worse?

41:49.089 --> 41:50.633
Because it's working.

41:52.510 --> 41:56.013
The good cells are fighting the bad stuff.
You're bound to feel weak.

41:57.973 --> 41:59.016
I wanna leave.

42:00.392 --> 42:01.727
You want to leave?

42:02.728 --> 42:03.729
Okay.

42:04.688 --> 42:06.815
Let's go. Come on.

42:07.650 --> 42:09.151
Doctor says you're getting better.

42:10.736 --> 42:14.865
You want to leave and stay sick forever,
or do you want to stay and get better?

42:14.949 --> 42:15.950
What's it gonna be?

42:20.704 --> 42:22.039
Stay and get better.

42:55.489 --> 42:56.490
Who's there?

43:44.496 --> 43:45.998
That's not real.

43:46.081 --> 43:49.043
- Eli.
-That's not real. It's not real.

44:04.850 --> 44:06.060
Let me out!

44:06.894 --> 44:08.812
Please!

44:20.074 --> 44:21.659
-No!

44:21.742 --> 44:23.577
-No. Please stop!

44:27.581 --> 44:30.376
Mom! Mom, Dad, help!

45:31.603 --> 45:32.980
What did you do?

45:37.693 --> 45:39.153
It wasn't me!

45:39.236 --> 45:41.780
Eli, you were standing
in front of the closet door.

45:41.864 --> 45:44.825
-'Cause I'd been hiding in there.
-With shards of glass?

45:44.908 --> 45:46.493
They wrote it on my window, too.

45:46.577 --> 45:49.204
-Your name?
-No. "Lie."

45:49.288 --> 45:51.039
You could've hurt yourself, honey.

45:51.999 --> 45:56.336
Eli, none of my other patients
have ever mentioned ghosts.

45:58.630 --> 46:02.426
- Hey.
-No. No one believes me!

46:17.399 --> 46:19.610
Oh, now you decide to show up.

46:20.944 --> 46:22.196
What happened last night?

46:22.863 --> 46:24.072
Did I get you in trouble?

46:28.786 --> 46:29.912
You look terrible.

46:30.829 --> 46:32.372
I feel terrible, too.

46:33.749 --> 46:34.708
What happened?

46:36.919 --> 46:39.296
If I tell you,
you have to promise not to laugh.

46:39.379 --> 46:40.380
Just spill it.

46:45.177 --> 46:46.595
I think this house is haunted.

46:48.138 --> 46:49.723
I think something bad happened here.

46:49.807 --> 46:53.393
-Great. Now you think I'm crazy, too.

46:53.977 --> 46:55.562
No, I don't think you're crazy.

46:55.646 --> 46:56.814
Then why'd you laugh?

46:58.398 --> 47:01.944
Because Perry,
the kid who stayed here before you,

47:02.027 --> 47:03.237
he said the same thing.

47:06.532 --> 47:08.325
-He did?
-Yep.

47:08.408 --> 47:10.536
Well, I don't talk to him
as much as I talk to you,

47:10.619 --> 47:12.830
but he said that he was seeing ghosts.

47:13.831 --> 47:17.084
Dr. Horn said none of her patients
ever saw ghosts.

47:17.167 --> 47:18.335
And you believe her?

47:20.671 --> 47:21.922
Mom and Dad said to trust her.

47:22.840 --> 47:25.759
Oh, and I'm sure your parents
always tell you the truth.

47:27.845 --> 47:30.848
Perry said the longer he was in there,
the more clearly he saw them,

47:30.931 --> 47:32.558
and he told Dr. Horn that.

47:33.225 --> 47:36.144
-Well, what did she say?
-I don't know.

47:36.895 --> 47:38.730
He said he was about to get
Procedure Three.

47:40.482 --> 47:42.484
And that was the last time I saw him.

47:47.322 --> 47:50.409
-I need to get out of here.
-So get your hazmat and go.

47:50.492 --> 47:53.787
I can't. I wouldn't survive outside
without my parents.

48:01.086 --> 48:02.170
Wait here a sec.

48:24.860 --> 48:26.236
Aah.

48:30.157 --> 48:31.575
No!

48:31.658 --> 48:33.493
No! Let go of me!

48:37.164 --> 48:38.332
No!

48:54.473 --> 48:57.142
No! Let me go!

48:57.684 --> 48:59.895
No! Let go of me!

49:09.655 --> 49:11.531
No. No. No!

49:12.491 --> 49:14.743
Let me out! Let me out!

49:20.332 --> 49:22.751
No. No. No!

49:24.670 --> 49:26.964
No. No, stop!

49:28.298 --> 49:29.216
No!

49:48.235 --> 49:49.528
Eli, breathe.

49:50.529 --> 49:52.155
Eli, breathe.

49:52.239 --> 49:53.240
Breathe.

49:53.323 --> 49:54.408
-Breathe.
- Eli?

49:55.450 --> 49:56.451
Eli?

49:57.077 --> 49:58.120
What's going on?

49:58.203 --> 50:01.331
I-I heard screams.
He was trying to leave the house.

50:01.873 --> 50:03.458
They opened the door.

50:04.710 --> 50:05.836
Haldol, 20 ccs!

50:05.919 --> 50:07.963
I thought you said this place was secure.

50:08.046 --> 50:10.173
Must have been
an electrical short circuit.

50:11.883 --> 50:13.135
You know about the ghosts.

50:13.218 --> 50:14.761
Eli, you have to stop it.

50:14.845 --> 50:15.887
Hurry, hurry!

50:15.971 --> 50:17.264
I know about Perry!

50:19.850 --> 50:21.393
Who-Who's Perry?

50:21.476 --> 50:23.770
-I-I don't know what you're talking about.
-Lie.

50:23.854 --> 50:24.896
Who's Perry?

50:26.189 --> 50:29.067
Lie! You're a liar!

50:30.110 --> 50:31.987
Someone tell me what's actually going on.

50:32.070 --> 50:35.323
Eli, I'm right here.
Look at me. I'm right here.

50:35.407 --> 50:37.284
Okay? Breathe. Breathe.

50:37.367 --> 50:38.285
Let's make our wish.

50:38.368 --> 50:40.245
I don't want to make a fucking wish!

50:50.338 --> 50:51.339
Mom?

51:00.474 --> 51:01.475
He's...

51:07.022 --> 51:10.233
He's just not--
he's not accepting treatment.

51:14.654 --> 51:18.408
He's just not accepting it. No, he's not.

51:20.243 --> 51:23.330
I think we have to prepare for
the decision. We're just going to do it.

51:25.665 --> 51:27.334
He's not accepting treatment.

51:27.417 --> 51:29.461
So there's no other choice
at this point.

51:29.544 --> 51:30.879
Yeah.

51:32.881 --> 51:37.094
I was just saying that I can't believe
that he actually tried to leave.

51:39.221 --> 51:41.765
The last treatment
didn't go as I'd hoped.

51:41.848 --> 51:44.101
Eli's brain is waging a war
against the serum.

51:44.893 --> 51:47.270
That's why he's feeling
so sick and delusional.

51:48.313 --> 51:50.148
I'm going to administer diazepam

51:50.232 --> 51:52.359
to enable him to rest until dawn,

51:52.442 --> 51:55.237
and then we'll begin the final procedure.

51:57.072 --> 51:58.156
Wait.

51:59.282 --> 52:01.535
I think I should be the one
that gives it to him.

52:04.079 --> 52:05.914
He'll take it better coming from me.

52:36.027 --> 52:37.612
I'm not crazy, Mom.

52:39.114 --> 52:40.574
I know you're not.

52:42.701 --> 52:43.910
Dad thinks I am.

52:44.744 --> 52:46.413
No, he doesn't.

52:47.622 --> 52:49.583
-He doesn't.
-Yes, he does.

52:51.835 --> 52:53.920
He looks at me like he doesn't believe me.

52:55.338 --> 52:58.091
You mean the same way
you're looking at me right now?

53:03.513 --> 53:05.182
You know, this is hard for him.

53:05.974 --> 53:07.601
Watching you go through this.

53:09.311 --> 53:11.354
He was the one that found Dr. Horn.

53:11.438 --> 53:13.899
He looked everywhere
for a doctor to help you.

53:14.774 --> 53:16.359
We would never have brought you here

53:16.443 --> 53:19.070
if we didn't think you could go on
and live a normal life.

53:22.908 --> 53:24.326
But you said you believed me.

53:24.409 --> 53:27.495
I do. I believe
that you saw things. I just...

53:28.872 --> 53:31.625
I just don't believe
the things you saw are real.

53:37.505 --> 53:38.506
Hey.

53:39.716 --> 53:40.717
Trust me.

53:41.426 --> 53:43.887
I know the effects
medication can have on the mind.

53:43.970 --> 53:46.723
You see something,
and you swear it was real.

53:46.806 --> 53:47.891
But it's not.

53:51.436 --> 53:53.480
I know how hard this is for you.

53:55.982 --> 53:57.400
But it's almost over.

53:58.068 --> 53:59.986
You just need to get some sleep.

54:02.322 --> 54:04.324
-What's that?
-What?

54:06.409 --> 54:07.410
What?

54:09.829 --> 54:12.958
I'm not as good at tricks as some people.

54:14.584 --> 54:15.585
Here.

54:18.838 --> 54:21.466
-What is it?
-It's just something to help you sleep.

54:32.602 --> 54:33.603
Show me.

54:36.856 --> 54:38.233
Good.

54:40.944 --> 54:41.945
Come here.

54:44.698 --> 54:46.783
You know I love you, right?

54:47.659 --> 54:48.660
I know.

54:59.713 --> 55:01.506
Three-one-seven--

55:01.589 --> 55:02.590
What?

55:06.011 --> 55:07.012
Okay, lie down.

55:14.144 --> 55:15.186
Sweet dreams.

56:22.253 --> 56:23.338
Haley.

56:31.096 --> 56:32.597
Bitch. Unh.

56:33.932 --> 56:35.141
Still alive, huh?

56:35.225 --> 56:40.271
Listen. Did Perry ever say if the ghost
was trying to hurt him or help him?

56:40.438 --> 56:41.981
He didn't say. Why?

56:42.482 --> 56:44.859
Because they tried to
drag me out of the house,

56:44.943 --> 56:48.530
and I'm not sure if they
wanted to kill me or get me to leave.

56:48.613 --> 56:51.157
It kind of sounds like
they wanted to kill you.

56:51.241 --> 56:52.700
Why would you think otherwise?

57:00.083 --> 57:00.959
"Lie"?

57:01.292 --> 57:04.587
They wrote that. On my window
and on my closet door.

57:05.713 --> 57:07.298
But if you turn it upside down...

57:09.968 --> 57:12.387
Three-one-seven. What does that mean?

57:12.470 --> 57:15.098
This is what they've been
trying to tell me the entire time.

57:16.057 --> 57:19.060
Ooh. Oh, like a secret code
to a secret door.

57:19.144 --> 57:20.562
I never said it was a door.

57:22.272 --> 57:23.940
Don't give me that suspicious look.

57:24.023 --> 57:26.109
It was just the first thing
that entered my head.

57:26.192 --> 57:27.861
You're not a ghost, too, are you?

57:28.778 --> 57:32.157
What kind of drugs do they got you on now?
Do I look like a ghost?

57:34.367 --> 57:35.869
I think it is a code to a door...

57:36.536 --> 57:37.495
to the medical wing.

57:37.579 --> 57:39.080
-What's in there?
-Answers.

57:39.164 --> 57:40.832
-To what?
-To why she's lying.

57:42.250 --> 57:43.835
Are you gonna do it?

57:43.918 --> 57:45.128
What if you get caught?

57:47.964 --> 57:49.299
Everybody's gotta sleep.

57:50.800 --> 57:51.801
Right?

59:56.175 --> 59:57.844
Lie.

1:00:41.929 --> 1:00:44.223
What were you and Dr. Horn talking about?

1:00:45.558 --> 1:00:46.559
What?

1:00:47.518 --> 1:00:49.687
What were you and Dr. Horn talking about?

1:00:50.897 --> 1:00:52.231
Before I came along.

1:00:57.278 --> 1:00:58.279
Tell me.

1:00:59.822 --> 1:01:02.700
Just talking about
the need to be prepared...

1:01:03.618 --> 1:01:05.161
for all possibilities.

1:01:05.870 --> 1:01:07.914
All possibilities? What do you mean?

1:01:19.592 --> 1:01:22.679
Look, she said that
with each procedure, there are...

1:01:23.846 --> 1:01:25.306
inherent risks.

1:01:27.433 --> 1:01:29.811
He had a bad reaction to the last one.

1:01:32.605 --> 1:01:36.359
And for every chance that
he's gonna pull through, there's...

1:01:40.321 --> 1:01:42.323
-What?
-There's a chance that he won't.

1:01:46.661 --> 1:01:47.662
She said that?

1:01:48.830 --> 1:01:49.872
It's what she said.

1:01:51.207 --> 1:01:53.251
That she doesn't think it's gonna work?

1:01:57.922 --> 1:01:59.424
Then I don't understand.

1:02:00.383 --> 1:02:04.220
She's cured every one of her patients.
That's what you told me.

1:02:07.974 --> 1:02:09.392
That's what I told Eli.

1:02:18.192 --> 1:02:19.569
Why would you lie to me?

1:02:21.904 --> 1:02:23.823
Why would you lie to me about that?

1:02:25.324 --> 1:02:28.035
Just tried to do what's best for Eli.

1:02:29.120 --> 1:02:32.498
You knew this was always
a possibility, Rose.

1:02:32.582 --> 1:02:34.208
Is his life in danger?

1:02:36.502 --> 1:02:37.545
Is it?

1:02:44.969 --> 1:02:46.846
How dare you?

1:02:46.929 --> 1:02:47.930
How dare I?

1:02:48.014 --> 1:02:50.057
-I'm leaving.
-How dare I?!

1:02:50.141 --> 1:02:52.727
-I'm taking him with me.
-After what you did?

1:02:53.394 --> 1:02:55.480
You're the one
that wanted to try anything!

1:02:57.857 --> 1:02:59.692
<i>And you're in denial.</i>

1:02:59.776 --> 1:03:03.070
<i>We had one chance to do the right thing.</i>

1:03:03.154 --> 1:03:05.198
<i>Rose. Rose!</i>

1:03:24.425 --> 1:03:27.929
Eli.

1:04:12.640 --> 1:04:14.600
"Perry. Treatment 1."

1:04:18.688 --> 1:04:20.022
"Treatment 2."

1:04:22.692 --> 1:04:23.776
Treatment 3.

1:04:28.781 --> 1:04:31.117
"Agnes. Treatment 1."

1:04:33.244 --> 1:04:34.370
Treatment 2.

1:04:36.581 --> 1:04:38.040
Treatment 3.

1:04:40.543 --> 1:04:42.461
"Lucius. Treatment 1."

1:04:44.005 --> 1:04:45.339
"Treatment 2."

1:04:47.091 --> 1:04:48.509
"Treatment 3."

1:05:32.303 --> 1:05:34.931
Mom! Dad, we have to leave!

1:05:55.159 --> 1:05:56.661
-Take a breath, Rose.

1:05:56.744 --> 1:05:57.995
Open the door.

1:05:58.079 --> 1:05:59.205
Open this door!

1:06:01.582 --> 1:06:04.418
I am leaving, and I'm taking him with me.

1:06:04.502 --> 1:06:07.505
-Where would you go?
-Anywhere. As far away as possible.

1:06:07.588 --> 1:06:10.549
And keep him hidden in a glass cage
away from the world?

1:06:10.633 --> 1:06:13.761
-What kind of life is that?
-A life where he is loved.

1:06:16.764 --> 1:06:20.518
No amount of love
can protect him from his condition.

1:06:21.102 --> 1:06:25.189
You know that. You've seen with
your own eyes how bad it can get.

1:06:25.272 --> 1:06:28.609
It will only get worse,
and by then, it's gonna be too late.

1:06:31.404 --> 1:06:33.447
Out there, there's nothing but suffering.

1:06:33.531 --> 1:06:35.908
There's only suffering for him in here.

1:06:35.992 --> 1:06:39.245
-In here, there's still a chance.
-Is there?

1:06:41.414 --> 1:06:43.416
I need to know that you can save him.

1:06:45.501 --> 1:06:47.503
With you by my side, I can, Rose.

1:06:54.885 --> 1:06:55.928
Mom!

1:07:11.736 --> 1:07:13.320
Must have gotten in last night.

1:07:14.488 --> 1:07:18.034
Dad. Dad, where's Mom?
We all need to leave right now.

1:07:18.117 --> 1:07:20.619
-She'll be back in a minute.
-No.

1:07:20.703 --> 1:07:22.496
No, we have to leave right now.

1:07:22.580 --> 1:07:24.582
Dad, it's her. It's Dr. Horn.

1:07:25.541 --> 1:07:27.126
I saw her files.

1:07:27.209 --> 1:07:29.879
None of her patients
made it past the third procedure.

1:07:29.962 --> 1:07:31.881
Dad, they all died.

1:07:37.344 --> 1:07:39.013
You remember the old meadow?

1:07:40.890 --> 1:07:43.934
The one we took Bronson to
when he was just a pup.

1:07:46.103 --> 1:07:51.358
Last night, I had a dream that
we were playing ball in the old meadow...

1:07:52.610 --> 1:07:55.613
and Bronson was chasing the ball.
He was attacking it.

1:07:55.696 --> 1:07:57.198
Remember how he used to do that?

1:07:58.240 --> 1:07:59.241
Dad.

1:08:01.660 --> 1:08:03.162
You're scaring me.

1:08:04.830 --> 1:08:06.123
No, no, no. Come here.

1:08:11.087 --> 1:08:13.714
You are so loved, Eli.

1:08:14.882 --> 1:08:16.217
You know that.

1:08:18.302 --> 1:08:20.930
Sometimes I get jealous of you,
the way Mom...

1:08:22.098 --> 1:08:24.892
says, "You know I love you, right?"
And you say...

1:08:25.684 --> 1:08:26.852
I know.

1:08:29.188 --> 1:08:30.773
Like it's nothing to you.

1:08:33.609 --> 1:08:37.196
That makes me happy, the way you say it
like that, like it's nothing.

1:08:38.489 --> 1:08:40.407
Love is normal.

1:08:40.491 --> 1:08:42.451
There's just no doubt in your mind.

1:08:44.578 --> 1:08:45.579
Eli.

1:08:46.580 --> 1:08:49.625
I'm so... sorry...

1:08:50.793 --> 1:08:52.002
for all this.

1:08:55.506 --> 1:08:56.549
Come here.

1:08:59.885 --> 1:09:01.345
Ow! Aah!

1:09:02.721 --> 1:09:03.764
Why did you do that?

1:09:05.099 --> 1:09:08.602
- Take him to the exam room.

1:09:09.270 --> 1:09:11.605
Let go! She's brainwashed you!

1:09:12.398 --> 1:09:16.569
Mom! Dad! You have to believe me!
I saw the files!

1:09:16.652 --> 1:09:17.862
Aah!

1:09:17.945 --> 1:09:20.865
-Let go!
- This is for your own good.

1:09:21.532 --> 1:09:25.035
No! No, she's gonna kill me!

1:09:25.119 --> 1:09:26.829
Like she killed the others!

1:09:26.912 --> 1:09:29.665
-Let go!
- Why isn't the sedation working?

1:09:29.748 --> 1:09:33.419
Mom! Mom, please, you have to believe me!

1:09:33.502 --> 1:09:35.379
-She killed all her--

1:09:37.464 --> 1:09:38.674
Oh...

1:09:42.052 --> 1:09:43.554
-Ow!

1:09:44.513 --> 1:09:45.556
Eli!

1:09:45.639 --> 1:09:47.808
Eli! Stop!

1:09:54.607 --> 1:09:56.734
-Eli.
-She moved them!

1:09:56.817 --> 1:09:58.819
-She knows I know.
- Settle down.

1:09:58.903 --> 1:10:00.696
You killed your patients, didn't you?

1:10:01.447 --> 1:10:04.742
You experimented on them,
and then you murdered them!

1:10:04.825 --> 1:10:08.120
But they're still here!
They're still here in this house!

1:10:08.204 --> 1:10:09.747
-Eli, breathe.
-Get back!

1:10:09.830 --> 1:10:12.124
-You are sicker than you realize.
-You get away from me!

1:10:12.208 --> 1:10:13.334
Get back, all of you!

1:10:14.752 --> 1:10:18.047
I thought they were trying to hurt me,
but they never hurt anyone.

1:10:18.130 --> 1:10:20.466
-It was you the whole time.
-Eli, take a breath.

1:10:43.614 --> 1:10:45.908
Eli, we're all just trying to help you.

1:10:46.867 --> 1:10:48.827
-Open the door.

1:10:48.911 --> 1:10:50.454
-Eli.
- Eli!

1:10:51.413 --> 1:10:54.208
Okay, we'll get in another way.
Come with me.

1:12:20.753 --> 1:12:22.880
Mom, Dad, I was right. This place is not--

1:12:24.631 --> 1:12:27.384
What are you doing?
What are you doing? Let me out!

1:12:27.468 --> 1:12:30.179
-Let me out. I can't breathe!
-You can't leave him in there.

1:12:30.262 --> 1:12:31.305
I can't breathe!

1:12:32.139 --> 1:12:34.141
-We have to.
-No!

1:12:34.224 --> 1:12:35.559
He knows.

1:12:58.290 --> 1:13:00.667
- Eli.

1:13:13.931 --> 1:13:15.015
I can breathe.

1:13:19.186 --> 1:13:20.729
I can breathe.

1:13:20.813 --> 1:13:21.772
I can breathe.

1:13:31.281 --> 1:13:34.410
Mom! Mom, Dad, I'm not sick!

1:13:34.493 --> 1:13:35.744
I can breathe!

1:13:40.707 --> 1:13:42.626
Why did you tell me I was sick?

1:13:45.003 --> 1:13:47.047
Why did you tell me I was gonna die?

1:13:48.715 --> 1:13:51.343
Let me out! Let me out!

1:13:53.637 --> 1:13:56.432
-Please, Mom, let me out!
- Rose.

1:13:56.515 --> 1:13:58.058
Let me out!

1:13:58.725 --> 1:13:59.726
Rose.

1:14:01.437 --> 1:14:03.522
I know he's awake, but we're almost ready.

1:14:03.605 --> 1:14:05.983
-I need to see him.
-I wish you wouldn't. If we just proceed--

1:14:06.066 --> 1:14:07.109
I'm not asking.

1:14:16.243 --> 1:14:17.244
Eli.

1:14:18.454 --> 1:14:19.705
Eli, can you hear me?

1:14:23.292 --> 1:14:25.002
I'm sorry I lied to you.

1:14:27.045 --> 1:14:29.798
You were never allergic to the outside,

1:14:29.882 --> 1:14:33.260
but I had to make you believe you were
to protect you.

1:14:35.179 --> 1:14:37.014
Protect you from the world.

1:14:45.481 --> 1:14:47.733
I know this must be so confusing...

1:14:48.775 --> 1:14:50.068
and scary...

1:14:51.111 --> 1:14:53.489
but no one's trying to hurt you, honey.

1:14:54.364 --> 1:14:56.408
And none of this is your fault.

1:14:59.369 --> 1:15:00.454
It's mine.

1:15:04.082 --> 1:15:07.711
But, baby, you've got to
see this last procedure through,

1:15:07.794 --> 1:15:11.381
and then I promise you,
I will explain everything.

1:15:14.301 --> 1:15:15.302
Eli.

1:15:17.054 --> 1:15:18.055
Eli.

1:15:20.599 --> 1:15:21.600
Eli.

1:15:22.601 --> 1:15:23.685
-Aah!

1:15:34.071 --> 1:15:36.031
- That was Eli.
- Eli!

1:15:36.198 --> 1:15:37.741
Eli! No!

1:15:39.535 --> 1:15:41.119
Eli!

1:15:41.203 --> 1:15:42.329
Aah!

1:15:57.719 --> 1:15:59.638
Eli!

1:15:59.721 --> 1:16:00.973
Open this door!

1:16:02.140 --> 1:16:03.475
Open the door!

1:16:04.685 --> 1:16:06.937
-What's happening?
-They lied to me!

1:16:08.564 --> 1:16:09.898
I'm not sick!

1:16:11.775 --> 1:16:13.068
They're gonna kill me!

1:16:34.506 --> 1:16:38.218
Open this door! You don't understand
what's happening here!

1:16:39.469 --> 1:16:41.513
-I can't do it!
-Yes, you can.

1:16:41.597 --> 1:16:43.557
You're so much stronger than the others.

1:16:43.640 --> 1:16:46.643
-Eli! Open this door!

1:16:52.149 --> 1:16:53.317
Don't be afraid.

1:16:53.400 --> 1:16:54.401
No!

1:16:55.193 --> 1:16:56.236
Don't be afraid, Eli.

1:16:56.320 --> 1:16:58.447
-No!
- Don't be afraid.

1:16:58.530 --> 1:17:01.908
-You.
-They're the ones who are afraid!

1:17:01.992 --> 1:17:04.536
No! No! No!

1:17:32.773 --> 1:17:33.857
Oh!

1:17:40.364 --> 1:17:42.407
No! Let go!

1:17:47.996 --> 1:17:49.373
-No!
-Get his shirt off.

1:17:49.456 --> 1:17:51.083
- No!
-Get his shirt off.

1:17:55.337 --> 1:17:57.923
No! Unh. Dad!

1:17:58.006 --> 1:18:00.425
Why are you doing this? No!

1:18:01.885 --> 1:18:04.262
No! No! No!

1:18:06.390 --> 1:18:07.391
What are you doing?

1:18:10.602 --> 1:18:13.313
Rose. What are you doing?

1:18:14.231 --> 1:18:15.273
He was right.

1:18:17.025 --> 1:18:18.694
She wants to kill him.

1:18:19.736 --> 1:18:21.822
I saw the bodies of the children.

1:18:22.781 --> 1:18:24.574
She buried them down there.

1:18:26.993 --> 1:18:28.453
She didn't save any of them.

1:18:30.247 --> 1:18:32.499
Why did you tell me you could save him?

1:18:33.250 --> 1:18:34.876
Because I can.

1:18:34.960 --> 1:18:37.587
I thought I could cure Eli.
God knows I wanted to.

1:18:37.671 --> 1:18:40.966
The gene therapy would've worked
if he weren't so strong.

1:18:41.049 --> 1:18:44.636
He's too far gone,
but he could still be saved.

1:18:44.720 --> 1:18:48.849
-Mom, what is she talking about? Mom!
-Get back! Get back!

1:18:50.183 --> 1:18:51.601
Don't you touch my son.

1:18:52.352 --> 1:18:53.937
We've got to get him out of here.

1:18:54.020 --> 1:18:56.523
He cannot leave here. You know that.
Not the way he is.

1:18:56.606 --> 1:18:59.568
I'll get you out of here, honey.
We're gonna leave.

1:18:59.693 --> 1:19:01.319
Honey, get this...

1:19:02.362 --> 1:19:04.781
-Get off of me!
-Rose. Rose.

1:19:06.158 --> 1:19:07.367
Let me help you.

1:19:08.744 --> 1:19:10.328
You're gonna help me get him out of here.

1:19:12.205 --> 1:19:13.540
I'll help you.

1:19:13.623 --> 1:19:14.791
-Promise?
-Yes.

1:19:16.001 --> 1:19:17.169
Untie him, please.

1:19:22.883 --> 1:19:23.884
Save him.

1:19:27.763 --> 1:19:29.097
Paul.

1:19:29.181 --> 1:19:30.682
-Paul, what are you doing?
-No!

1:19:31.224 --> 1:19:34.227
-I can save his soul.
-No. What are you doing?

1:19:34.311 --> 1:19:36.188
-She's gonna kill him!
-No!

1:19:36.271 --> 1:19:37.773
-No!
-No!

1:19:37.856 --> 1:19:39.983
Get off of me! No, get off me!

1:19:40.066 --> 1:19:40.984
-No!
-Dad!

1:19:41.902 --> 1:19:43.653
-Rose!
-Dad!

1:19:43.737 --> 1:19:45.739
What are you doing?

1:19:45.822 --> 1:19:48.408
Dad! Dad, why are you doing this?

1:19:49.117 --> 1:19:50.619
No! No!

1:19:53.497 --> 1:19:54.539
Eli...

1:19:55.707 --> 1:19:58.335
you were brought here with love and hope.

1:19:58.418 --> 1:19:59.294
No!

1:19:59.377 --> 1:20:02.464
Your parents have been working with me
for longer than you realized.

1:20:02.547 --> 1:20:04.466
No. No!

1:20:04.549 --> 1:20:06.134
The sickness you have--

1:20:06.218 --> 1:20:08.220
I'm not sick. I could breathe.

1:20:08.970 --> 1:20:10.055
I could breathe.

1:20:11.973 --> 1:20:14.518
The sickness you have
doesn't come from outside.

1:20:15.519 --> 1:20:16.686
It comes from within.

1:20:17.395 --> 1:20:18.605
What did I do?

1:20:19.815 --> 1:20:22.609
-What did I do?
-You didn't do anything wrong.

1:20:24.486 --> 1:20:25.570
But you will.

1:20:29.658 --> 1:20:31.910
Mom! Mom, what's happening?

1:20:34.454 --> 1:20:37.082
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Ghost.

1:20:37.165 --> 1:20:38.208
Amen.

1:20:45.465 --> 1:20:47.133
Saint Michael the Archangel,

1:20:47.217 --> 1:20:49.219
illustrious leader of the heavenly army,

1:20:49.302 --> 1:20:51.972
defend us in the battle against
the rulers of the world of darkness,

1:20:52.055 --> 1:20:54.266
and in the spirit of wickedness
in high places,

1:20:54.349 --> 1:20:56.977
-heed my prayer.
-Let our prayers be heard by thee.

1:20:57.978 --> 1:21:03.567
God arises, his enemies scattered,
and those who hate him flee before him.

1:21:08.613 --> 1:21:10.490
"Accursed diabolical legion,

1:21:10.574 --> 1:21:13.535
we abjure you by the living God,
by the true God, by the holy God,

1:21:13.618 --> 1:21:17.122
who so loved the world that he gave us
his only begotten son

1:21:17.205 --> 1:21:20.458
so that those who believe in him
may not perish but have everlasting life.

1:21:20.542 --> 1:21:22.627
Begone, serpent, master of lies!

1:21:23.378 --> 1:21:26.339
In the name of our Lord Jesus Christ,
deliver us!

1:21:27.299 --> 1:21:29.885
No! Aah! Aah!

1:21:33.930 --> 1:21:36.099
May this holy water purify the skin.

1:21:52.407 --> 1:21:53.617
May this dagger...

1:21:55.243 --> 1:21:56.578
purify the soul.

1:22:04.628 --> 1:22:06.796
May you find peace and forgiveness

1:22:06.880 --> 1:22:08.506
in the arms of the Lord, Eli.

1:22:09.507 --> 1:22:10.550
Eli!

1:22:14.304 --> 1:22:15.305
Aah!

1:22:33.990 --> 1:22:35.033
Aah.

1:22:37.410 --> 1:22:38.411
No!

1:22:41.998 --> 1:22:43.708
-Dr. Horn!

1:22:43.792 --> 1:22:45.502
-Dr. Horn!
<i>-Dios mío!</i>

1:22:45.585 --> 1:22:47.712
Dr. Horn. Dr. Horn!

1:23:16.950 --> 1:23:19.744
Come on, get up! We gotta get out of here!

1:23:27.585 --> 1:23:28.920
Open the door!

1:23:29.004 --> 1:23:31.089
Oh, my God!

1:23:34.843 --> 1:23:35.844
Watch.

1:23:47.272 --> 1:23:48.314
Eli.

1:23:52.193 --> 1:23:54.279
What has she been putting inside me?

1:23:55.947 --> 1:23:56.990
Let them go.

1:23:57.949 --> 1:24:00.618
What have you been putting inside me?

1:24:03.038 --> 1:24:04.039
Medicine...

1:24:05.415 --> 1:24:06.750
to make you feel better.

1:24:06.833 --> 1:24:09.711
-Lie!

1:24:09.794 --> 1:24:10.837
Holy water.

1:24:12.464 --> 1:24:13.631
It's holy water.

1:24:15.633 --> 1:24:17.427
The injections were tannis roots.

1:24:18.595 --> 1:24:21.389
Suppression medication
while she worked on your genes.

1:24:28.188 --> 1:24:29.397
What am I?

1:24:30.398 --> 1:24:31.691
What am I?!

1:24:31.775 --> 1:24:32.942
You're our son.

1:24:33.401 --> 1:24:34.903
-Lie!

1:24:38.531 --> 1:24:39.991
You're my son!

1:24:42.410 --> 1:24:43.411
And my father?

1:24:46.081 --> 1:24:47.457
I prayed, Eli.

1:24:48.708 --> 1:24:50.710
I prayed every day.

1:24:52.337 --> 1:24:53.588
Prayed to who?

1:24:58.885 --> 1:24:59.928
Prayed to who?!

1:25:12.816 --> 1:25:16.069
Prayed... to... who?

1:25:16.152 --> 1:25:17.821
The Lord didn't answer me.

1:25:20.615 --> 1:25:22.033
But your father did.

1:25:23.326 --> 1:25:26.079
He promised me
you wouldn't be like him, Eli.

1:25:27.997 --> 1:25:29.457
But he lied.

1:25:34.462 --> 1:25:36.506
The Devil always lies.

1:25:38.925 --> 1:25:40.093
Eli.

1:25:59.195 --> 1:26:01.239
I wanted you so desperately.

1:26:10.665 --> 1:26:11.749
Forgive me.

1:26:37.025 --> 1:26:38.026
Eli.

1:28:02.151 --> 1:28:03.319
Hey, Houdini.

1:28:06.823 --> 1:28:08.950
I knew you were stronger than the others.

1:28:10.618 --> 1:28:11.536
The others?

1:28:12.870 --> 1:28:13.997
Perry?

1:28:14.080 --> 1:28:16.291
And Lucius and Agnes,

1:28:16.374 --> 1:28:18.835
your sadly departed
half-brother and sister.

1:28:22.714 --> 1:28:23.840
Dad gets around.

1:28:24.882 --> 1:28:28.177
If you knew the whole time,
you could've just told me.

1:28:29.012 --> 1:28:30.638
Would you have believed me if I had?

1:28:31.431 --> 1:28:33.766
Sometimes you just have to
walk the path for yourself.

1:28:34.684 --> 1:28:37.228
Besides, we're not allowed
to set each other free.

1:28:37.312 --> 1:28:38.354
Why not?

1:28:39.188 --> 1:28:41.399
Um, Dad says you got to earn your place.

1:28:42.775 --> 1:28:43.776
My dad.

1:28:45.528 --> 1:28:47.363
I can take you to him if you want.

1:28:52.952 --> 1:28:54.370
You still trust her?

1:28:58.583 --> 1:29:00.126
It's cold outside.

1:29:18.436 --> 1:29:19.687
Hey, you.

1:29:20.855 --> 1:29:24.025
Yeah, you're driving.
Let's go. We got a long road ahead.

1:29:26.861 --> 1:29:28.654
-I'm driving?

1:29:47.215 --> 1:29:48.257
Oh, God.

1:29:58.935 --> 1:30:02.021
Mom, breathe. Breathe.

1:30:02.980 --> 1:30:04.899
Take a deep breath in.

1:30:07.110 --> 1:30:08.569
Blow out all your candles.

1:30:14.992 --> 1:30:15.993
Make a wish.

1:30:33.052 --> 1:30:35.179
-Let's go.
-Okay.
