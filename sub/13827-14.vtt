You snuck onto Dominator's ship to...

00:39.414 --> 00:41.542
Discover her breakfast beverage of choice.

00:41.625 --> 00:43.794
Coffee gal, huh! Would've pegged her
for a tea person.

00:43.877 --> 00:45.337
Well, now she's gonna peg us.

00:46.129 --> 00:47.548
Oh, that's it!

00:48.465 --> 00:51.802
I am sick and tired of Dominator!

00:58.559 --> 01:01.186
Sick and tired of running,
of being blasted,

01:01.270 --> 01:04.982
and I am sick and tired of this galaxy!
This is too hard!

01:05.524 --> 01:10.904

(SIGHS) Sorry, pal,
but we've gotta get out of here!

01:24.293 --> 01:27.588
No, Sylvia. We've gotta get
Dominator and Hater together.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.257
There's literally nothing in the galaxy

01:30.340 --> 01:33.051
that could stop me from uniting
those two in love.

Sylvia, did you play on this street?
Sylvia, did you eat in that diner?

01:56.950 --> 01:59.912
Sylvia, do you know that guy?
What about her, or him?

01:59.995 --> 02:03.582
Just because I'm from here doesn't mean
I know everybody. Hey, Joe.

Whassup, Syl? Long time no see.

Glad to see you haven't changed.

02:10.422 --> 02:12.883

02:55.509 --> 02:57.177
She seems nice.

02:57.886 --> 03:02.099
Oh, she'll be fine. She's probably just a
little sore because I kinda... sort of...

03:02.182 --> 03:04.685
left home without telling anybody.

03:04.768 --> 03:06.019
You did what?

03:06.186 --> 03:07.938
Oh, she's a tough old broad.

So, you guys must have all kinds of
wacky stories about Sylvia.

I'm trying to watch this... colors show.

04:05.787 --> 04:09.082
So let me ask you something there,
monkey-cat. How much you bench?

04:09.166 --> 04:11.251
Oh, please, when have you seen a cat?

04:11.335 --> 04:14.338

-What was that?
-Nothin'.

05:01.677 --> 05:04.304
Good. When you're done,
you can start on the carrots.

05:12.521 --> 05:14.231
Um, is there a salad?

05:17.401 --> 05:19.236
I'm sorry, a... a what?

05:19.486 --> 05:23.073
It's all right, Ma. He means, like,
bananas and nuts.

05:23.574 --> 05:24.992
Stuff monkeys eat.

05:25.075 --> 05:28.662

Here you go, buddy.

05:40.174 --> 05:41.675
Syl, you remember the butter?

05:43.677 --> 05:46.471
So, cat-monkey, how do you and
my sister know each other?

05:46.597 --> 05:49.892
Actually, Sylvia's been helping me
help folks all over the galaxy.

05:50.726 --> 05:52.686
Oh, yeah? What do you get paid to help?

05:52.769 --> 05:56.190
Just the warm satisfaction of knowing
our friends are happy.

a little easier on me,

Well, she'd also look like
an idiot holding this stick.

-Or tuna fish?

how much did you say you can bench?

14:40.839 --> 14:42.633
The Smooching Room?

14:44.885 --> 14:47.513
I've mapped out her whole ship
with a super scientific algorithm

14:47.596 --> 14:49.139
based on what I've seen of it so far.

14:49.223 --> 14:51.141
Here's her inner sanctum,
here's the war room,

14:51.225 --> 14:53.310
the arsenal, the smooching room,
the bedroom,

14:53.393 --> 14:55.229
this part is mostly shoes
and purses and stuff,

14:55.312 --> 14:56.522
the back-up smooching room...

14:56.605 --> 15:01.360
Sir, I seriously doubt an evil villain
has a smooching room, let alone two.

15:01.818 --> 15:03.028
We've got six.

15:07.991 --> 15:09.826
Sir, we've gotta get a closer look.

15:09.952 --> 15:14.206
One of us will have to sneak
aboard her... terrifying... ship.

15:16.750 --> 15:17.751
JERRY: Lord Hater,

15:17.835 --> 15:21.338
it's an honor to be chosen for this
mission. I won't let you down, I swear.

15:21.547 --> 15:24.049
All right, soldier, you're looking
for a big, scary...

15:24.132 --> 15:25.843
-But beautiful...
-Lady lava villain.

15:25.926 --> 15:27.344
Don't let her see you or you're doomed.

15:27.427 --> 15:29.805
And also a totally-lame-but-thinks
he's-cool shark guy.

15:29.888 --> 15:32.432
Yeah, watch out for him, too.
If he sees you, you're also doomed.

15:32.516 --> 15:33.684
The bots. Don't forget the bots.

15:33.767 --> 15:37.396
Right, the bots. Watch out for her army of
literally thousands of killer bots.

15:37.479 --> 15:39.815
If they catch you,
you're super doomed, got it?

15:39.940 --> 15:42.901
Uh-huh. On second thought...

15:43.235 --> 15:44.236
Good luck, soldier!

15:45.195 --> 15:46.488
(SCREAMS)

15:48.949 --> 15:49.950
BOTH: Yes!

15:53.161 --> 15:57.332
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

16:01.044 --> 16:04.131
Uh, Jerry, stop shaking the camera
and find the smooching room!

16:04.214 --> 16:06.049
It's down the passage on your left!

16:06.633 --> 16:08.051
There is no smooching room!

16:08.135 --> 16:11.471
Look for the war room. See if you can
find Awesome's secret weapon.

16:12.306 --> 16:15.475
Jerry, bots coming from up ahead!
Go back the way you came!

16:15.559 --> 16:16.810
(JERRY SCREAMING)

16:17.936 --> 16:21.398
No, they're coming from behind you!
Rush forward in a blind panic!

16:21.857 --> 16:22.858
(JERRY SCREAMS)

16:22.983 --> 16:25.319
Zig-zag! Run in a zig-zag pattern,
you'll be harder to shoot!

16:25.402 --> 16:27.070
Run right at 'em,
it'll totally confuse 'em!

16:27.154 --> 16:28.906
-(JERRY SCREAMS)
-(THUD)

16:29.907 --> 16:33.493
Jerry, get outta there! We didn't send you
to spy on the inside of a closet!

16:33.577 --> 16:34.953
-Listen.
-I'm tellin' ya, D,

16:35.037 --> 16:37.748
you're gonna go quiz-nazy
for my secret weapon.

16:37.831 --> 16:39.875
It's gonna sweep you off your feet.

16:40.250 --> 16:43.378
I'm interested. Tell me more
about this secret weapon.

16:44.254 --> 16:46.632
BOTH: This confirms my worst fears!
Wait, what?

16:46.715 --> 16:50.344
(JERRY SOBBING)

16:50.427 --> 16:52.763
-Jerry, stop crying!
-We can't hear anything!

16:52.846 --> 16:55.432
(JERRY SOBBING)

16:56.308 --> 16:58.018
No! What happened? Come back!

16:58.101 --> 17:00.437
Oh, his tears must've
shorted out the camera.

17:00.562 --> 17:01.980
There's only one thing to do, sir.

17:02.064 --> 17:05.400
If we wanna know what's going on,
we'll have to go see for ourselves.

17:05.484 --> 17:06.527
But how?

17:20.874 --> 17:24.628
Okay, it looks like a left ahead.
On my signal, and... now!

17:24.711 --> 17:25.754
Turn left.

17:28.966 --> 17:30.843
PEEPERS: I said left, sir. Left!

17:30.926 --> 17:32.344
HATER: My left or your left?

17:32.553 --> 17:34.137
PEEPERS: We have the same left!

17:37.558 --> 17:39.768
Do you know which way left is?

17:43.522 --> 17:44.606
What's that?

17:44.690 --> 17:46.441
It must be Awesome's secret weapon!

17:46.525 --> 17:48.402
We can't let it reach Dominator!

17:48.485 --> 17:51.613
Gotta play this cool so
as not to rouse suspicion.

17:58.537 --> 18:01.623
HATER: Hello, fellow fist fighter.

18:01.707 --> 18:04.293
What a lovely... I'm taking this out!

18:11.675 --> 18:12.676
Left!

18:14.303 --> 18:15.345
No!

18:15.929 --> 18:16.930
What?

18:18.932 --> 18:19.933
Whoa!

18:27.566 --> 18:28.817
(NEIGHS)

18:45.959 --> 18:47.794
There you are! Finally.

18:48.295 --> 18:49.296
PEEPER: Eep!

18:55.135 --> 18:56.970
O mighty Lord Dominator, we present to you

18:57.054 --> 18:59.598
Emperor Awesome's totally
awesome top secret weapon,

18:59.681 --> 19:03.101
guaranteed to conquer the galaxy...
and your heart.

19:03.810 --> 19:07.481
Oh, no, we were both right!
They are taking over the galaxy together!

19:07.564 --> 19:10.234
And they are dating!
Peepers, what do we do?

19:16.073 --> 19:18.951
Hey, babe, heard you were looking
for a secret weapon.

19:19.034 --> 19:21.828
Well, check out these guns! Wah-pow!

19:23.872 --> 19:26.124
No! That's so cool!

19:29.086 --> 19:30.087
Karate.

19:33.382 --> 19:34.591
♪ Let's get awesome! ♪

19:35.008 --> 19:38.887
As you can see, I've set them
to stun. Huh? Huh!

19:39.346 --> 19:43.016
Oh, wow. Oh, and I thought
you were all talk.

19:43.100 --> 19:46.687
I didn't think you'd actually
try anything. I'm impressed.

19:46.770 --> 19:48.355
PEEPERS: Oh, thank grop, you were right.

19:48.438 --> 19:51.567
They're just dating. There's no secret
weapon. What a relief.

19:53.110 --> 19:56.196
Now they're gonna smooch,
get married, and have babies,

19:56.280 --> 20:00.492
and I'm gonna be alone forever...

20:00.576 --> 20:02.369
Oh, you're not alone, sir.

20:02.452 --> 20:05.038
You have me and the Watchdogs.

20:05.122 --> 20:06.999
who needs Dominator anyway?

20:07.082 --> 20:10.252
Why, if she can't see that you're really
the greatest in the galaxy,

20:10.335 --> 20:11.879
then she doesn't deserve you.

20:12.462 --> 20:14.256
Really? You think?

20:14.381 --> 20:18.760
Of course. Besides, I don't think there's
gonna be any smooching. Look.

20:19.511 --> 20:20.554
You know, when you showed up,

20:20.637 --> 20:23.182
I was, like, right, like I'm letting
that scrub on my ship.

20:23.265 --> 20:25.184
But it was a slow day,
no big planets to dominate,

20:25.267 --> 20:27.060
nothing but reruns on, so I figured,

20:27.144 --> 20:29.813
maybe he does have some kind of
secret super weapon.

20:29.897 --> 20:33.400
At least it would be entertaining.
But you know what?

20:33.483 --> 20:37.112
I never guessed what a pathetic
waste of time you'd be.

20:37.196 --> 20:40.199
Do you really think I'd let you ride
my coattails to the top?

20:40.282 --> 20:45.037
Ha! Get real, buster! Not even that idiot
Hater is as delusional as you.

20:45.370 --> 20:47.623
-She knows my name!
-She called you an idiot.

20:47.748 --> 20:49.416
An idiot whose name she knows!

20:50.542 --> 20:54.171
Don't be like that, babe. Come on,
what about all the good times?

20:54.254 --> 20:56.256
Hey, take it easy, D.

20:56.340 --> 20:58.258
That's Lord Dominator, if you're nasty.

20:59.259 --> 21:01.094
Baby, wait!

21:02.262 --> 21:03.263
Bots!

21:05.557 --> 21:07.476
HATER: She hates Awesome and loves me.

21:07.559 --> 21:09.978
-PEEPERS: Sir...
-HATER: (SINGING) Hater's gonna date her.

21:10.062 --> 21:12.022
-PEEPERS: Sir!
-HATER: Oh yeah!

21:12.105 --> 21:13.148
PEEPERS: Sir!

21:21.281 --> 21:23.575
Yeah! She likes me!

21:28.705 --> 21:30.332
Sir, she's cold and heartless!

21:30.415 --> 21:32.668
I really don't think she
wants to date anyone!

21:34.837 --> 21:38.674
Cold and heartless? You're just jealous.
She's not so bad.

21:43.929 --> 21:46.849
(DOMINATOR LAUGHING DEVIOUSLY)

21:49.434 --> 21:54.982
JERRY: Sir? Come in, sir.
You left me on Dominator's... ship.

21:55.065 --> 21:57.067
(JERRY SCREAMS)

21:58.277 --> 21:59.945
Oh, what is with these guys?
