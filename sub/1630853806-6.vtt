WEBVTT

00:25.442 --> 00:26.818
We look good.

00:26.901 --> 00:28.528
You look good. I look amazing.

00:29.571 --> 00:31.906
Saw your video. Nice camera work.

00:31.990 --> 00:33.283
But you'll never get that price

00:33.366 --> 00:35.368
for such a mid- to low-end building
with no doorman.

00:35.452 --> 00:37.245
It's a beautiful building.

00:37.328 --> 00:39.080
And I live there, so watch it.

00:39.164 --> 00:42.959
Oh dear. So your packages
just squat on the lobby floor?

00:43.043 --> 00:45.086
-Do you even have a lobby?
-We have a lobby.

00:45.170 --> 00:46.004
Got it.

00:47.047 --> 00:50.592
Okay, at some point, you guys
are either gonna have to fuck or fight.

00:50.675 --> 00:53.178
Ooh. Hate fuck. Another exciting item

00:53.261 --> 00:55.138
-for my new single life checklist.

00:56.181 --> 00:58.600
Whoa, forget about Tyler.
This video is blowing up.

00:58.683 --> 01:00.226
-Oh!
-Look at all these comments.

01:00.310 --> 01:02.896
"Gorgeous lighting and fixtures."
"Beautiful layout."

01:02.979 --> 01:06.191
"I just want to bury my face in your fat…"
Okay, I'mma delete this one.

01:08.276 --> 01:13.823
Ugh! Billy is hosting a roller disco
for GLSN tonight. Wanna come?

01:13.907 --> 01:16.493
No, I've had dinner with you
so much lately.

01:16.576 --> 01:20.080
Tonight, I wanna go home, take off my bra,
and eat dinner out of the carton.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.457
I hate eating dinner alone.

01:22.540 --> 01:25.919
I don't know if it's that I miss Colin
or miss always having a dinner date.

01:26.002 --> 01:28.880
Men. Do we love 'em
for the dick or the date?

01:28.963 --> 01:31.257
-The great debate of all time.

01:44.395 --> 01:46.356
Look at you two. Straight outta <i>Xanadu.</i>

01:46.439 --> 01:48.358
There's nothing straight about <i>Xanadu.</i>

01:48.441 --> 01:51.653
Truth. Now hurry. Let's get out here
and show these boys what you got.

01:51.736 --> 01:54.948
I can't even skate. I just didn't want
to stay home alone again.

01:55.031 --> 01:57.158
You're missing out
on one of life's great joys.

01:57.242 --> 02:00.203
I love my me time.
Home alone, no one to bother me.

02:00.286 --> 02:03.123
-Just you and Pornhub.
-That accounts for just a fraction.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.667
But seriously, you need to embrace it.

02:05.750 --> 02:08.169
Do everything you couldn't do
when Colin was there.

02:08.253 --> 02:13.007
What, like eat garlic at dinner?
Leave the bed unmade for ten minutes?

02:13.091 --> 02:14.717
Well, I guess I can fart whenever I want.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.803
-That is a big advantage to being single.
-Charming.

02:16.886 --> 02:19.347
You couldn't fart around each other
after all those years?

02:19.430 --> 02:20.765
Colin said once you do,

02:20.849 --> 02:22.851
the end of the relationship
is around the corner.

02:22.934 --> 02:23.852
I'm with Colin.

02:23.935 --> 02:27.188
You guys keep talking about this,
and I'm going to end our relationships.

02:27.272 --> 02:29.732
Why do you think I insisted
on an apartment with a terrace?

02:29.816 --> 02:30.984
I needed to survive.

02:31.067 --> 02:33.945
I guess that explains
everybody stepping outside to smoke.

02:34.028 --> 02:37.365
Exactly. Okay, I'm gonna
take these for a spin. Wish me luck!

02:37.448 --> 02:38.616
Oh!

02:38.700 --> 02:39.784
Good luck!

02:41.119 --> 02:43.413
Oh shit. Jerry's here.

02:43.997 --> 02:46.124
Is he someone you fucked,
or someone you fucked over?

02:46.207 --> 02:48.835
Neither. He's a new teleprompter guy
from the station.

02:48.918 --> 02:50.712
He keeps trying to hang out with me.

02:50.795 --> 02:54.090
Not my type,
but I have to keep him on my good side.

02:54.174 --> 02:57.760
One typo and I'm that dumb hot guy
from the news bloopers.

02:57.844 --> 03:00.763
You get shallower and shallower
as this conversation goes on.

03:00.847 --> 03:04.142
We're all shallow. I'm just honest
about it, which makes me deep.

03:04.809 --> 03:07.520
Anyway, I lied and told him
I had to cancel our dinner last week

03:07.604 --> 03:10.440
because my friend Stanley
is having an emotional crisis.

03:10.523 --> 03:12.609
Michael is actually having
an emotional crisis.

03:12.692 --> 03:13.860
Why didn't you use him?

03:13.943 --> 03:17.113
Sorry. You've been
my emotional crisis go-to for years.

03:17.197 --> 03:22.035
I'm too old to change horses.
Here he comes. Keep that… sad face going.

03:23.077 --> 03:27.081
Billy! So good to finally see you
out of the station.

03:27.165 --> 03:29.292
Yeah. You too.

03:29.375 --> 03:33.213
Jerry, this is my friend Stanley James,
whom I may have mentioned.

03:33.296 --> 03:35.131
Oh, yes, Stanley. Hi there.

03:35.924 --> 03:37.091
How are you?

03:37.175 --> 03:38.301
I'm fine.

03:40.094 --> 03:41.095
Now.

03:41.179 --> 03:43.890
Okay. I'm gonna go attend
to my hosting duties.

03:43.973 --> 03:45.683
I'll see you boys on the ice.

03:46.517 --> 03:50.313
Wait. Are you <i>the</i> Stanley James?
The art dealer?

03:50.396 --> 03:52.899
Never been called
<i>the</i> Stanley James before.

03:52.982 --> 03:53.942
Please continue.

03:54.025 --> 03:55.318
I follow your gallery.

03:55.401 --> 03:57.820
You have <i>the</i> best eye
for emerging artists.

03:57.904 --> 03:59.822
Such great taste.

04:01.032 --> 04:03.243
I'm-- I'm a little starstruck.

04:03.743 --> 04:04.911
Well, thank you.

04:05.912 --> 04:08.081
Next time you're in the neighborhood,
say hello.

04:08.164 --> 04:09.040
I will.

04:09.749 --> 04:11.209
Maybe I can take you out to lunch,

04:11.292 --> 04:14.003
and you can tell me
how you built such an awesome career.

04:14.587 --> 04:18.925
Only if you tell me how you managed
to get into… teleprompting.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.518
Hey.

04:28.601 --> 04:30.728
-Oh!

04:30.812 --> 04:32.981
-Oh. Oh my God.

04:33.648 --> 04:36.901
I am so sorry. Are you okay?

04:39.821 --> 04:42.156
Yeah, I just got the wind
knocked out of me.

04:42.240 --> 04:44.075
Okay, all right. There.

04:44.826 --> 04:45.868
Hup!

04:45.952 --> 04:47.328
Whoa!

04:47.412 --> 04:48.663
Hey, you sure you're all right?

04:48.746 --> 04:50.164
Yeah, really, I'm fine.

04:50.248 --> 04:51.457
All right. Oh!

04:54.043 --> 04:55.336
-Here.
-Oh!

04:55.420 --> 04:58.339
Great. I'm, uh… I'm Luke, by the way.

04:58.423 --> 05:00.258
Michael. Hi.

05:00.341 --> 05:01.843
Nice slamming into you.

05:03.177 --> 05:06.472
Wow. You're funny.
And also super handsome.

05:07.056 --> 05:09.892
Which means there is zero chance
that you're single.

05:10.601 --> 05:11.811
Think again.

05:12.312 --> 05:18.151
Really? Any interest in putting your
number in here so I can check up on you?

05:22.780 --> 05:23.781
Here you go.

05:23.865 --> 05:25.408
Nice to meet you, Michael.

05:25.992 --> 05:26.826
You too.

05:28.119 --> 05:29.120
Are you okay?

05:29.203 --> 05:32.707
He ran over my toe. I think it's broken.
Get me to Urgent Care before I cry.

05:32.790 --> 05:35.126
-You were holding all that in?
-He was hot!

05:44.886 --> 05:47.513
Michael, can you come up here?

06:02.320 --> 06:04.238
I was going to look at the bedrooms,

06:04.322 --> 06:07.784
but I'm not sure
I see myself living in a townhouse.

06:07.867 --> 06:09.118
Too many stairs.

06:10.286 --> 06:12.997
I had the same thought
when you asked me to come up here.

06:13.081 --> 06:14.374
Oh!

06:14.457 --> 06:17.293
Anyway, let me make things easier for you.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.753
You're gonna carry me down?

06:19.253 --> 06:22.256
I want to live
in the building where the Masons live.

06:22.840 --> 06:25.426
Uh, we checked before.
There's nothing for sale there.

06:25.510 --> 06:29.806
Michael, everything's for sale.
It all comes down to a matter of price.

06:45.655 --> 06:46.489
Hi.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.534
Oh no! They booted you.

06:50.118 --> 06:52.078
-Honestly, it's no big deal.

06:52.161 --> 06:53.871
-It's just a couple of days.

06:53.955 --> 06:57.041
Although I might keep it on longer
on account of how sexy it is.

06:58.751 --> 07:02.547
You're joking, but… I'm not <i>not </i>turned on.

07:02.630 --> 07:05.049
Just tell me
you're not a professional soccer player.

07:05.133 --> 07:08.219
Yeah. I'm in the pro,
over-40 geezer league

07:08.302 --> 07:10.555
-that's caught fire with all the kids.

07:10.638 --> 07:13.141
I sell residential real estate.
What about you?

07:13.224 --> 07:16.602
Oh, nothing that glamorous.
I am a third grade teacher.

07:16.686 --> 07:18.020
First, I love that you think

07:18.104 --> 07:22.316
showing grumpy, perpetually dissatisfied
people apartments is glamorous.

07:22.400 --> 07:25.111
-At least you're contributing to society.

07:25.194 --> 07:27.363
-Shaping young minds.
-Oh, easy!

07:27.447 --> 07:29.949
It's-- it's Dalton, not <i>Stand and Deliver.</i>

07:30.032 --> 07:32.535
But it's little kids,

07:32.618 --> 07:36.038
so I do have the strongest immune system
in the world.

07:36.706 --> 07:39.167
-I've been sneezed on more than Kleenex.

07:39.750 --> 07:42.879
My ex and I talked about having kids,
but we never got around to it.

07:42.962 --> 07:44.172
We're bad gays.

07:44.255 --> 07:46.424
We didn't get married.
We didn't become dads.

07:46.507 --> 07:47.467
We turned on Madonna.

07:47.550 --> 07:49.760
-Wow, the trifecta!
-Yeah.

07:50.595 --> 07:52.013
My ex wanted kids,

07:52.096 --> 07:57.518
but as much as I love teaching, I didn't
wanna come home to more of that energy.

07:58.644 --> 08:02.690
It's one of the things that broke us up.
That and his wandering penis.

08:05.943 --> 08:09.405
So… if you don't mind my asking,

08:10.490 --> 08:12.116
what went wrong with you and…

08:13.117 --> 08:13.951
Colin.

08:14.952 --> 08:17.705
He never really told me. He just left.

08:20.082 --> 08:22.293
Have you got his name
off the credit cards yet?

08:22.376 --> 08:24.212
That took me forever.

08:24.295 --> 08:27.089
He got my name off in a day.

08:27.173 --> 08:29.509
There was definitely
some advanced planning involved.

08:29.592 --> 08:31.636
-AmEx knew about our breakup

08:31.719 --> 08:32.970
way before I did.

08:33.054 --> 08:34.722
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

08:39.477 --> 08:43.689
Mm! Damn, that is good.
You know, Colin wouldn't share food.

08:44.440 --> 08:47.318
Don would share,
but he was on a raw food diet

08:47.401 --> 08:51.072
and would only eat food
warmed by the sun, so pass.

08:52.073 --> 08:54.825
-Let's not talk about our exes anymore.

08:54.909 --> 08:58.621
Colin and Don
are hereby disinvited to the party.

08:58.704 --> 08:59.705
Okay.

09:01.541 --> 09:02.792
What do we do instead?

09:17.098 --> 09:21.060
Hey, what do you think about taking this
inside somewhere? Say, my place?

09:21.143 --> 09:24.397
If you could see what's going on
in my pants, you wouldn't have to ask.

09:24.480 --> 09:25.314
Yeah?

09:25.815 --> 09:28.359
I wanna make sure
we're not moving too fast.

09:29.193 --> 09:31.070
Less pressure for you than it is for me.

09:31.153 --> 09:33.072
Uh… You're probably right.

09:33.155 --> 09:36.117
-Oh, damn it. I didn't wanna be right!
-Oh!

09:36.784 --> 09:38.995
Mm. Uh, I…

09:39.078 --> 09:40.204
Mm!

09:40.329 --> 09:41.581
Mm-- Aah!

09:41.664 --> 09:45.042
I get in my head, but I don't wanna
overthink this, 'cause it feels so right.

09:45.126 --> 09:47.628
-Should we go for it?
-You don't have to ask me twice.

09:47.712 --> 09:50.464
-I just did.
-Oh, shut up and get in the cab.

09:52.967 --> 09:54.552
-You first.
-Oh!

10:12.737 --> 10:15.948
Mm. Last night was amazing.

10:16.032 --> 10:17.199
Mm!

10:18.659 --> 10:21.912
You're the first person
to sleep in this bed since…

10:24.874 --> 10:27.460
You okay? You wanna talk about it?

10:29.337 --> 10:32.006
A guy who wants to talk about my feelings?

10:32.673 --> 10:34.467
You really are the exact opposite

10:34.550 --> 10:38.262
of the last person
to occupy that side of the bed.

10:49.398 --> 10:51.984
We're seeing each other
five nights in a row. It's effortless.

10:52.068 --> 10:53.736
Oh! Michael, that makes me so happy.

10:53.819 --> 10:55.196
-Thanks.
-And guess what?

10:55.279 --> 10:58.074
I'm not gonna be able to make poker
tomorrow night because,

10:58.157 --> 11:00.534
and here come four words
I haven't said in a year,

11:01.035 --> 11:01.869
I have a date.

11:01.952 --> 11:04.038
Stanley! That's so great. Who with?

11:04.121 --> 11:07.124
That guy Billy pawned me off on
at the skating party.

11:07.208 --> 11:08.459
Cue card guy?

11:08.542 --> 11:09.877
It's teleprompter.

11:09.960 --> 11:11.837
And it's more interesting than it sounds.

11:12.922 --> 11:14.840
Not a ton more, but enough.

11:14.924 --> 11:16.801
And he's so into art!

11:16.884 --> 11:18.010
So there's that.

11:18.094 --> 11:21.597
Plus, he has perfect teeth.
You know how I am about teeth.

11:21.681 --> 11:24.392
Fuck the eyes.
I think teeth are the windows to the soul.

11:24.475 --> 11:28.187
Can you believe we both met great guys
at the same time? Maybe it's an omen.

11:28.270 --> 11:32.566
Oh! I hope so. This almost makes me
wanna lift a weight.

11:37.488 --> 11:38.823
Well, that sounds great.

11:38.906 --> 11:40.574
Okay, bye.

11:41.283 --> 11:43.786
Hey, so we have an appointment

11:43.869 --> 11:46.372
to show the place in your building
to a client tomorrow.

11:46.455 --> 11:48.833
Oh, it is like the world has aligned,

11:48.916 --> 11:52.002
and everything is
Michael, Michael, Michael.

11:52.086 --> 11:53.045
The client is Claire.

11:53.129 --> 11:55.923
So much for the fucking universe.
How did she hear about it?

11:56.006 --> 11:57.800
She saw our video on the website.

11:57.883 --> 11:59.427
-And what is wrong with Claire?

11:59.510 --> 12:00.344
She loves you.

12:00.428 --> 12:02.972
Yeah. Yeah. A little too much.

12:03.055 --> 12:06.016
Listen to these texts
that she sent just this week.

12:06.100 --> 12:09.103
-Monday, "Do you wanna go for a walk?"
-Sounds nice.

12:09.186 --> 12:11.188
Tuesday, "Do you wanna be my plus-one?"

12:11.272 --> 12:13.566
A party with free alcohol?
Oh, she is terrible.

12:13.649 --> 12:16.569
Wednesday, "Can you tell
what I did to my chin?"

12:16.652 --> 12:20.448
"No? Well, good.
I didn't do anything. Or did I?"

12:21.407 --> 12:25.369
If she lives in the same building as me,
these texts will be drop-bys.

12:25.453 --> 12:27.621
Well, and don't take this the wrong way,

12:27.705 --> 12:30.499
your building is probably
way too down-market for Claire Lewis.

12:30.583 --> 12:35.045
I love it! The light here is fabulous!

12:35.129 --> 12:38.090
-And these high ceilings--
-They're what makes it feel so spacious.

12:38.174 --> 12:41.343
You need to be aware there are
no amenities in this building. No gym--

12:41.427 --> 12:43.596
-You'll get a Peloton.
-No doorman.

12:43.679 --> 12:46.515
-No one to judge your walk of shame.
-Only two bedrooms.

12:46.599 --> 12:49.643
-Fewer house guests.
-Stop. That's impossible.

12:49.727 --> 12:54.315
I need at least three bedrooms.
Is there anything bigger in this building?

12:54.398 --> 12:56.400
No, nothing. Sorry.

12:56.484 --> 12:57.860
Oh, damn it!

12:57.943 --> 13:00.404
I wanted to move where I knew someone.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.573
When I found out you lived here,
I thought,

13:02.656 --> 13:06.577
"Yes! I'll have a friend right there."

13:06.660 --> 13:08.496
"Maybe it won't be so hard."

13:09.413 --> 13:14.960
Living alone after 25 years…
can take some getting used to.

13:15.044 --> 13:16.921
Let me check in some buildings close by.

13:17.004 --> 13:19.173
I'm sure there's something
in the neighborhood.

13:19.256 --> 13:21.842
Oh! Michael!

13:25.179 --> 13:27.890
I appreciate all your help. Both of you.

13:27.973 --> 13:29.850
-Goodbye, Suzanne.
-Bye.

13:31.101 --> 13:32.895
-Aw!

13:36.816 --> 13:40.486
-Uh-huh. Is that the new guy?
-He wants to hang again tonight.

13:41.862 --> 13:45.533
A non-stop week of seeing each other.
Watch out. You don't wanna smother him.

13:45.616 --> 13:48.577
I won't. Tomorrow is our poker game,
so we'll have a night off.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.246
You wanna join? Stanley can't make it.

13:50.329 --> 13:53.582
The last time I played with you guys,
I lost money and the wig off my head.

13:53.666 --> 13:55.960
That wig pulled
Billy's Halloween costume together.

13:56.794 --> 13:57.837
Yeah. I'm out.

14:05.010 --> 14:08.138
Michael! How'd the showing go?

14:08.222 --> 14:09.890
Unfortunately, she's not the buyer.

14:09.974 --> 14:11.892
But don't worry, Jack.
We have a lot of interest.

14:11.976 --> 14:14.228
Well, I'm sure
you'll find the right person.

14:14.854 --> 14:18.232
Hey, Jack. Um, I'm playing poker
with some friends tomorrow night.

14:18.315 --> 14:20.109
We have an extra seat at the table.
Interested?

14:20.192 --> 14:23.279
A table full of gay boys
taking off all their clothes?

14:23.362 --> 14:24.738
Sign me up!

14:24.822 --> 14:27.783
It's not strip poker, Jack.
It's actual poker.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.827
Oh, your generation.

14:29.910 --> 14:32.997
I guess I'll just undress you all
with my eyes.

14:36.667 --> 14:37.960
Oh!

14:38.544 --> 14:41.922
The first time it said "And guest"
on something of mine,

14:42.006 --> 14:44.425
it was like ripping open the wound again.

14:44.925 --> 14:48.554
It made me realize
Robert really was gone for good.

14:49.555 --> 14:51.223
-Hi.
-Hey.

14:52.975 --> 14:55.644
But you seem to be healing quite nicely.

14:56.937 --> 14:59.398
-Feelin' better all the time.
-Mm!

15:04.486 --> 15:07.072
So. Dinner, movie, sex?

15:07.740 --> 15:09.783
Or movie, dinner, sex?

15:09.867 --> 15:12.828
Or how about sex, movie, dinner, sex?

15:16.582 --> 15:18.542
-Let's skip the movie.

15:30.387 --> 15:31.764
-Morning.
-Hey.

15:32.973 --> 15:34.642
-You shouldn't have.
-Aw!

15:35.976 --> 15:36.810
What's this?

15:37.353 --> 15:39.521
A frother. I, uh, bought us one.

15:40.731 --> 15:44.234
Oh. I don't really do froth.
I like my coffee black.

15:44.318 --> 15:46.987
Ah. Well, I like cappuccino
in the morning,

15:47.071 --> 15:49.406
so I thought I'd get one to keep here.

15:50.366 --> 15:52.534
They actually make a great wedding gift

15:52.618 --> 15:56.163
with a set of Bodum
double-walled glass mugs.

15:56.664 --> 15:58.457
Why are we talking about wedding gifts?

15:58.540 --> 16:01.043
Oh, I saw the invite
to your friends' wedding.

16:02.044 --> 16:04.505
Oh. They've been together for 12 years.

16:04.588 --> 16:07.883
-I don't think they're expecting gifts.
-Why get married if not for the gifts?

16:07.967 --> 16:10.260
-That's a good point. Screw the sentiment.

16:10.844 --> 16:13.430
So, what would you think
about going to the theater tonight?

16:13.514 --> 16:17.184
I just read a review of a play at
the Public that is supposed to be great.

16:17.267 --> 16:21.355
I would love to, but I have
a standing poker game with some friends.

16:21.438 --> 16:22.314
Huh.

16:22.398 --> 16:25.275
I thought that you would
welcome a night off.

16:25.359 --> 16:26.860
From you?

16:26.944 --> 16:28.278
Nah, I'm good.

16:28.362 --> 16:31.824
But, you know,
if you need one, by all means, I get it.

16:31.907 --> 16:34.368
-Uh… Hmm…

16:35.244 --> 16:38.998
I'm doing that thing in my head again.
It's stupid. You should come tonight.

16:39.999 --> 16:42.042
Oh. Yeah. Uh, great.

16:42.626 --> 16:48.090
I'd love to meet your friends.
But to be honest, I don't even play poker.

16:48.173 --> 16:53.846
But I do make some pretty amazing low-carb
snacks, though, if people are into that.

16:53.929 --> 16:55.848
It's a table full of gay men.

16:55.931 --> 16:58.017
Even the poker chips are carb-free.

17:04.481 --> 17:06.650
All I'm saying is,
I find it hard to believe

17:06.734 --> 17:09.987
that this whole Stanley-Jerry dating thing
really isn't about me.

17:10.070 --> 17:12.406
Because everything's all about you, Billy.

17:12.489 --> 17:14.533
-Finally, you understand.

17:14.616 --> 17:17.161
I see you, and I raise two dollars.

17:17.244 --> 17:18.412
Oh!

17:18.495 --> 17:21.415
-Oh my God, Luke. These are not low-carb.
-They totally are.

17:21.498 --> 17:24.043
The breading is crushed almond,
so go crazy.

17:24.126 --> 17:28.547
I think, in general,
we worry too much about what we eat.

17:28.630 --> 17:32.134
I've had a Clark Bar
every day for 35 years.

17:33.844 --> 17:37.222
I see you and raise you 20.

17:37.306 --> 17:39.308
Twenty? What the hell do you have, Jack?

17:39.391 --> 17:41.060
You should fold.

17:42.061 --> 17:44.605
I used to be the dresser
for Ms. Judith Light,

17:44.688 --> 17:48.358
who you may not be aware,
is quite the Broadway presence,

17:48.442 --> 17:51.278
despite her well-known TV work.

17:51.361 --> 17:55.032
She could bluff like nobody's business.

17:55.115 --> 17:57.409
Me, I never bluff.

17:57.493 --> 17:59.536
-Mm.
-I hear she's really nice.

17:59.620 --> 18:00.704
-Loves the gays.
-The best.

18:00.788 --> 18:04.666
Yeah. I mean, these are great,
but, uh, what's the sweetness from?

18:04.750 --> 18:09.379
Apple juice. And then I cook them
in my trusty air fryer, with minimal oil.

18:09.463 --> 18:12.716
We love our air fryer. Last night,
I made pork chops. They were to die for.

18:12.800 --> 18:13.675
Don't tell my mother.

18:13.759 --> 18:15.302
-She thinks we're kosher.

18:15.385 --> 18:19.181
I should get one for you, babe. They are
essential for the low-carb lifestyle.

18:20.182 --> 18:21.058
That's new.

18:21.809 --> 18:22.768
Still mulling?

18:22.851 --> 18:25.437
-I… call.
-Babe…

18:26.271 --> 18:28.440
-Uh, can I get anybody anything?
-Nope.

18:28.524 --> 18:29.858
Perhaps a Clark Bar.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.735
-I will check.

18:33.445 --> 18:36.532
He's real, right? I could not have
concocted a more perfect guy for you.

18:36.615 --> 18:39.368
Such an improvement over Colin.

18:39.868 --> 18:42.621
Finance versus teaching says it all.

18:43.288 --> 18:46.708
The warmest thing Colin ever said to me
was, "Buy Apple,"

18:46.792 --> 18:48.836
which I'd done 30 years ago.

18:48.919 --> 18:51.338
How do you think I paid for the apartment?

18:51.964 --> 18:56.301
My point is.
maybe Luke is your next great love.

18:56.385 --> 18:57.845
I… I…

18:57.928 --> 18:59.388
What about you, Jack?

18:59.471 --> 19:01.849
You could still find someone.
Maybe in Miami?

19:01.932 --> 19:05.519
Maybe. But I had it all.
I know the difference.

19:05.602 --> 19:09.731
I'd rather be alone than be
in a relationship just to be in one.

19:09.815 --> 19:11.066
Mm-hmm. Hear, hear.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.526
-Billy.
-Mm?

19:12.609 --> 19:13.485
It's on you.

19:13.569 --> 19:15.863
I call. What do you have?

19:15.946 --> 19:16.947
Full house.

19:17.030 --> 19:17.865
No!

19:17.948 --> 19:21.702
Or, as Judith would say, "Who's the boss?"

19:24.246 --> 19:26.790
This is Stanley's fault.

19:27.457 --> 19:29.084
-How?
-I'm distracted.

19:29.751 --> 19:32.379
Wondering what Stanley's saying
about me to Jerry.

19:32.462 --> 19:35.007
What makes you think
they're even talking about you?

19:36.967 --> 19:40.387
The bruise on his face
he said he got from a windstorm?

19:40.470 --> 19:42.556
A spider fell in his lap
in the dressing room,

19:42.639 --> 19:45.642
and he jumped up and he ran into a wall!

19:45.726 --> 19:47.603
Oh my God!

19:47.686 --> 19:52.024
He said he almost died
in service to the people.

19:52.107 --> 19:54.026
I can't wait to tell everyone.

19:54.109 --> 19:56.153
Oh, you didn't hear it from me.

19:58.614 --> 20:01.116
And thanks for coming to dinner.

20:02.284 --> 20:07.873
Thank you for such amazing conversation.
Your knowledge of art is… impressive.

20:07.956 --> 20:10.667
Well, my mom taught me everything.

20:10.751 --> 20:13.086
She loves art.

20:13.170 --> 20:16.632
Every weekend,
we went to museums, galleries.

20:16.715 --> 20:17.549
Me too.

20:18.217 --> 20:22.221
It was a way to get lost
in beauty that was so personal,

20:22.304 --> 20:24.473
like looking into an artist's soul.

20:25.224 --> 20:26.892
Can I get you gentlemen coffee?

20:28.518 --> 20:30.729
-How about coffee at my place?
-Check, please.

20:30.812 --> 20:34.733
We have got to have them over
for a <i>Housewives </i>viewing party, babe.

20:36.526 --> 20:37.569
Uh-huh.

20:37.653 --> 20:39.363
It's to you, "babe."

20:40.739 --> 20:41.615
Aah.

20:41.698 --> 20:46.745
All right, I'll see your ten,
and I will raise you 16.

20:46.828 --> 20:48.038
-Mm.
-Ooh.

20:48.121 --> 20:49.331
Okay, I call.

20:53.168 --> 20:56.046
-A straight.
-Do three queens beat a straight?

20:57.256 --> 20:59.007
If he throws the first rock.

20:59.091 --> 21:00.717
-Oh!

21:01.218 --> 21:05.597
-Oh, that does it for me. I'm tapped out.
-Fine. Let's call it.

21:05.681 --> 21:08.892
I never thought I'd say this,
but we've gotta go and relieve the nanny.

21:08.976 --> 21:10.978
But the wedding's coming up,
and we need your RSVPs.

21:11.061 --> 21:11.937
-Oh!
-All right!

21:12.020 --> 21:15.482
That's your wedding!
The invite was beautiful.

21:15.565 --> 21:18.568
-I taught myself calligraphy for those.
-Wow, really?

21:18.652 --> 21:20.070
No. You're so cute.

21:21.113 --> 21:22.489
I love a gay wedding.

21:22.572 --> 21:25.993
-I never take them for granted.
-You should come, be Michael's plus-one.

21:26.952 --> 21:28.245
Oh.

21:28.328 --> 21:31.748
Thank you,
but I think that's Michael's call.

21:37.838 --> 21:39.131
Wanna come to the wedding?

21:39.881 --> 21:41.091
I'd love to!

21:41.174 --> 21:42.426
Yay!

21:44.761 --> 21:48.098
Great. So, uh… what can I get you? Vodka?

21:48.890 --> 21:51.393
Or vodka?

21:51.476 --> 21:53.729
-I guess I'll take a vodka.
-Great choice.

21:53.812 --> 21:56.940
Wait, but first, there's something
I've been dying to show you all night.

21:57.649 --> 21:58.734
Ta-da!

21:59.318 --> 22:00.402
Oh!

22:01.236 --> 22:02.404
My God.

22:02.487 --> 22:05.490
Right? I-- I mean,
what-- what do you think?

22:06.074 --> 22:10.454
Um… Well… Clearly, the artist's vision…

22:10.537 --> 22:11.371
Yes.

22:11.455 --> 22:15.417
And the artist whose vision is so clear is

22:16.460 --> 22:17.294
my mother.

22:17.878 --> 22:19.963
Really? Wow!

22:20.589 --> 22:23.759
Such a… specific talent.

22:23.842 --> 22:25.802
Yes! Uh, uh… self-taught!

22:25.886 --> 22:27.346
Yeah, that comes through.

22:27.429 --> 22:28.764
She used to be an accountant,

22:28.847 --> 22:33.018
but after a pretty serious stroke,
her world flooded with color.

22:33.101 --> 22:34.269
-These colors?
-Yeah.

22:34.353 --> 22:38.398
She quit her job, and…
and dedicated herself to her passion.

22:39.107 --> 22:40.317
-Art.
-Oh.

22:41.193 --> 22:42.527
Fascinating.

22:42.611 --> 22:46.948
I mean, she's unsung in Minneapolis.
Mm. No one there really appreciates art.

22:47.032 --> 22:49.201
-There's a big art scene--
-It's no New York.

22:51.161 --> 22:54.748
But I just think
if someone took a chance on her,

22:55.957 --> 22:57.501
you know, met with her…

22:58.668 --> 23:00.504
Someone with a good eye,

23:01.129 --> 23:02.297
like you.

23:08.178 --> 23:10.055
-I'd be happy to.

23:29.074 --> 23:30.158
Oh…

23:30.242 --> 23:31.576
Oh my God!

23:32.744 --> 23:34.371
Oh my God.

23:34.454 --> 23:35.831
Mm.

23:35.914 --> 23:38.250
Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Mm.

23:40.752 --> 23:42.838
Mm. I--

23:42.921 --> 23:44.464
I-- I can't. I can't.

23:44.548 --> 23:47.592
I can't meet your mother. I'm sorry.

23:47.676 --> 23:49.010
W-- Why? What happened?

23:49.094 --> 23:51.054
Her paintings are…

23:51.638 --> 23:55.434
The composition is unbalanced.
The scale doesn't go with the subject.

23:55.517 --> 24:00.188
The color combinations are amateurish.
And the whole painting says nothing.

24:00.272 --> 24:02.649
Except maybe, "I can't paint."

24:02.732 --> 24:04.943
I'm sorry, but I just have to be honest.

24:05.026 --> 24:07.529
Well, if we're being honest,
I'm not feeling this.

24:08.405 --> 24:12.826
Intellectually, there was an attraction,
but my dick is saying otherwise.

24:14.161 --> 24:15.162
Of course.

24:17.706 --> 24:19.708
You know, we never stood a chance, really.

24:19.791 --> 24:24.963
Me being a super successful art dealer
and you a mere telepromptress.

24:25.046 --> 24:30.427
But since you're so willing to barter
your rapidly aging boyish good looks,

24:30.510 --> 24:32.596
why don't you try your luck at Gagosian?

24:32.679 --> 24:36.308
Maybe you could blow a dealer there
into thinking your mother has talent.

24:37.309 --> 24:39.102
Oh God!

24:45.692 --> 24:47.319
I love your friends.

24:47.402 --> 24:48.945
They're so welcoming.

24:49.029 --> 24:50.947
Especially the Jonathans. Mm!

24:51.031 --> 24:53.450
And Billy seemed very down-to-earth
for a celebrity.

24:54.451 --> 24:56.828
Celebrity might be a reach.

24:57.412 --> 25:02.209
More like budding narcissist who's on TV
for five minutes twice a night.

25:02.292 --> 25:05.003
You seem a little tense, babe.
Everything okay?

25:07.214 --> 25:09.966
I don't know. Hmm.
Maybe I'm stuck in my head again.

25:11.301 --> 25:14.721
Well, I will give you a massage
when we're done.

25:14.804 --> 25:16.306
-Mm.
-Get you relaxed.

25:16.973 --> 25:17.807
Thank you.

25:20.727 --> 25:24.773
There's something sad about Jack.
I mean, besides losing his partner.

25:24.856 --> 25:28.527
It's like he almost doesn't wanna try
for another relationship.

25:30.153 --> 25:31.613
-Aah.

25:31.696 --> 25:32.531
Anyway,

25:33.490 --> 25:36.284
we should really schedule
a <i>Housewives </i>viewing party.

25:36.368 --> 25:37.953
Not even an "excuse me"?

25:39.162 --> 25:41.665
-What do you mean?
-You just farted,

25:41.748 --> 25:43.250
and you didn't even say "Excuse me."

25:43.333 --> 25:46.753
Is that where we are already,
five days in? Just let 'em rip?

25:47.629 --> 25:49.422
Well, I'm sorry.

25:50.131 --> 25:51.258
Excuse me.

25:51.341 --> 25:52.884
And it's been a week.

25:52.968 --> 25:56.179
-It's not like I don't have a terrace.
-What's the big deal?

25:56.263 --> 25:59.516
The big deal is
that once you fart around each other,

25:59.599 --> 26:02.227
you can see the end of the relationship
around the corner.

26:02.310 --> 26:05.355
Well, I think that's a little repressed.

26:05.438 --> 26:08.567
It just means
you're getting comfortable with someone.

26:10.193 --> 26:11.444
You're a great guy, Luke,

26:11.528 --> 26:14.781
but I don't think I'm ready
to get that comfortable with someone yet.

26:15.532 --> 26:17.450
Okay, what-- what's goin' on here?

26:19.077 --> 26:22.747
I think I rushed into this
because I hate eating dinner alone.

26:22.831 --> 26:27.294
And then the frother, and the "babes,"
and the plus-one started stacking up,

26:27.377 --> 26:30.005
and I could feel myself
getting more and more freaked out.

26:30.088 --> 26:33.174
And I tried to convince myself,
mm, that it was just in my head,

26:33.258 --> 26:36.136
but I think that this is all
just happening way too soon.

26:36.803 --> 26:40.765
I can't will myself into a relationship
just because I miss being in one.

26:42.309 --> 26:43.602
Are you breaking up with me?

26:43.685 --> 26:47.105
How can we break up after a week?
We barely know each other.

26:49.065 --> 26:52.235
Fine, if you wanna throw all this away,
go ahead.

26:52.319 --> 26:56.323
But you're gonna wake up tomorrow morning
all alone and realize I'm a fucking catch.

26:56.406 --> 26:57.741
You are a catch.

26:58.366 --> 26:59.284
But, Luke…

26:59.367 --> 27:00.869
…you're early.

27:02.120 --> 27:05.290
And I think I probably need
to wake up alone for a while longer.

27:05.373 --> 27:07.250
Wow!

27:07.334 --> 27:10.170
Would have been nice
to have known this a little sooner.

27:10.670 --> 27:14.966
But how much time would that have saved?
It's been a week.

27:18.011 --> 27:19.721
I'm taking the frother!

28:07.727 --> 28:10.897
I just bought
the penthouse in your building.

28:10.980 --> 28:12.649
It's not even on the market.

28:12.732 --> 28:16.152
I told you, Michael,
everything's for sale.

28:16.236 --> 28:20.073
Now, do you keep champagne,
or do we have to order in?

28:22.033 --> 28:23.410
Oh, it's so teeny!
