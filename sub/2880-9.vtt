WEBVTT

00:01.395 --> 00:03.296
The math is all there.

00:03.298 --> 00:05.314
It's not real.
Yes, it is.

00:05.316 --> 00:08.551
Yeah... uh, look.
It is scientifically impossible

00:08.553 --> 00:10.736
for a person to tip a cow.

00:11.721 --> 00:13.356
Even you, with your stocky build

00:13.358 --> 00:15.558
and lumberjack shoulders,
you couldn't do it.

00:16.726 --> 00:18.227
It's horrible. Why would
you push a cow over?

00:18.229 --> 00:19.195
They're sacred.

00:19.197 --> 00:20.446
Oh, stop it.

00:20.448 --> 00:22.415
I've seen you eat,
like, a million hamburgers.

00:22.417 --> 00:25.501
Hey, an animal can be both
sacred and delicious.

00:26.587 --> 00:28.170
Look, I'm telling you
I've done it, okay?

00:28.172 --> 00:29.905
I clearly remember
the cow standing up

00:29.907 --> 00:31.457
and then the cow on its side.

00:31.459 --> 00:33.376
Were you drunk?

00:33.378 --> 00:36.912
I was 16 in Nebraska.
What do you think?

00:36.914 --> 00:39.849
I think <i>you're</i> the one
who fell over.

00:39.851 --> 00:44.470
That would explain why the sky
was also on its side.

00:44.472 --> 00:45.638
Hey.

00:45.640 --> 00:48.090
Howard. Cow tipping:
real or not?

00:48.092 --> 00:50.476
Mmm. I'm gonna say... not.

00:50.478 --> 00:52.562
That's just based on me
trying to roll

00:52.564 --> 00:54.697
my mom over
when she's snoring.

00:55.899 --> 00:58.901
Speaking of that big
side of beef,

00:58.903 --> 01:02.204
uh, she's invited all of you
to Thanksgiving at her house.

01:02.206 --> 01:03.272
Aw.

01:03.274 --> 01:05.206
Mmm.

01:05.209 --> 01:07.126
You know, I've been told
that a bald refusal

01:07.128 --> 01:09.462
of an invitation is rude
and one must instead

01:09.464 --> 01:11.247
offer up a polite excuse, so...

01:11.249 --> 01:13.716
I'd love to go,
but, unfortunately,

01:13.718 --> 01:15.585
that sounds awful.

01:19.072 --> 01:21.040
Come on, it'll be fun.

01:21.042 --> 01:22.391
Uh, we were actually
gonna do it here.

01:22.393 --> 01:24.143
Please? Bernadette's
bringing her dad

01:24.145 --> 01:25.261
'cause her mom's out of town,

01:25.263 --> 01:27.396
and I never have anything
to say to that guy.

01:27.398 --> 01:29.798
Oh, since you put it that way,
I'd love to go,

01:29.800 --> 01:31.484
but that sounds even more awful.

01:32.469 --> 01:33.970
It'd actually be nice
to not hear

01:33.972 --> 01:35.738
Sheldon complain
about <i>my</i> cooking all day.

01:35.740 --> 01:37.156
Yo... uh,
excuse me,

01:37.158 --> 01:40.026
but every year
you prepare a terrible meal

01:40.028 --> 01:42.161
and every year I criticize it.

01:42.163 --> 01:44.480
Do our traditions
mean nothing to you?

01:46.650 --> 01:48.200
I want to go.
Yeah, me, too.

01:48.202 --> 01:49.585
I'm in.
Sheldon.

01:49.587 --> 01:52.038
Ugh, fine,
I'll go.

01:52.040 --> 01:54.490
But if her food is delicious,
Thanksgiving is ruined,

01:54.492 --> 01:55.658
and it's on you.

02:27.159 --> 02:29.614
Do we really have to go
to Mrs. Wolowitz's house?

02:30.162 --> 02:31.496
We do.

02:31.498 --> 02:34.315
And I expect you
to be on your best behavior.

02:34.317 --> 02:37.535
Now I know how the
African slaves felt.

02:39.138 --> 02:40.722
Being dragged
from their homes

02:40.724 --> 02:44.125
to labor under the
yoke of the white man.

02:44.127 --> 02:47.295
Are you honestly comparing
Thanksgiving dinner

02:47.297 --> 02:50.048
at Wolowitz's mom's with
one of the greatest tragedies

02:50.050 --> 02:51.766
in the history of mankind?

02:52.601 --> 02:54.836
Yes.

02:54.838 --> 02:56.888
Sheldon, you can have
a nice Thanksgiving anywhere.

02:56.890 --> 02:58.356
I spent one in Vegas.

02:58.358 --> 02:59.340
You did?

02:59.342 --> 03:01.342
Yeah, back when
I was dating Zack.

03:01.344 --> 03:02.977
It was actually more fun
than I thought.

03:02.979 --> 03:05.530
We gambled, we went to one
of those cheesy wedding chapels,

03:05.532 --> 03:07.148
we had a really good
turkey dinner.

03:07.150 --> 03:10.351
Which was surprising,
since we were at a strip club.

03:11.687 --> 03:13.204
Wait, you went
to a chapel?

03:13.206 --> 03:14.572
Yeah.
Why?

03:14.574 --> 03:17.525
We had one of those
silly fake weddings.

03:21.280 --> 03:22.513
Penny...

03:22.515 --> 03:24.732
you know those are real, right?

03:24.734 --> 03:27.218
(laughing):
No, they're not.

03:28.170 --> 03:29.370
Yeah, they are.

03:30.906 --> 03:32.423
No, they're not.

03:32.425 --> 03:34.041
Yeah, they are.

03:34.043 --> 03:35.710
He's right.
They're real.

03:37.229 --> 03:40.315
But it... didn't seem real.

03:41.266 --> 03:42.650
Let me ask you
a question.

03:42.652 --> 03:47.989
At any point, was
Las Vegas on its side?

03:51.010 --> 03:52.694
Hi, Dad.

03:52.696 --> 03:54.028
Hi, honey.

03:55.364 --> 03:57.332
Oh, you brought beer
for everybody.

03:57.334 --> 04:00.835
Uh, okay, yeah,
it's for everybody.

04:03.789 --> 04:06.491
I really just wanted to have
a nice, quiet day at home

04:06.493 --> 04:07.859
and watch the game.

04:07.861 --> 04:10.294
You can have a quiet day
and watch the game here.

04:10.296 --> 04:13.798
MRS. WOLOWITZ: Howard,
the medicine's not working!

04:14.883 --> 04:16.868
WOLOWITZ:
You just took it.

04:16.870 --> 04:19.370
At least let it
reach your first stomach!

04:23.592 --> 04:25.193
Hey, Mike.

04:25.195 --> 04:26.394
Let me help you out, there.

04:26.396 --> 04:28.529
Thanks. What's wrong
with your mom?

04:28.531 --> 04:29.897
Oh, her gout's flaring up.

04:29.899 --> 04:33.034
Turns out an apple pie a day
does not keep the doctor away.

04:34.570 --> 04:36.704
MRS. WOLOWITZ: How can one little toe
hurt so bad?

04:36.706 --> 04:38.105
(sighs)

04:38.107 --> 04:42.960
Maybe because that little piggy
is being crushed by the barn!

04:44.129 --> 04:46.214
(chuckles) She should
quiet down soon.

04:46.216 --> 04:49.217
I gave her enough pain meds
to choke a... well, her.

04:51.720 --> 04:53.705
I guess we're gonna
have to do all the cooking.

04:53.707 --> 04:54.889
I have a better idea.

04:54.891 --> 04:56.224
If you think you're
gonna make me

04:56.226 --> 04:57.642
do all this by myself,
you're crazy.

04:57.644 --> 04:59.510
I was gonna make Raj
do it all by himself.

04:59.512 --> 05:00.961
Oh, well, that's
a great idea.

05:03.816 --> 05:05.983
No traffic,
we're sailing.

05:05.985 --> 05:07.101
Yes.

05:07.103 --> 05:08.936
Like we're on a ship.

05:10.239 --> 05:12.657
Coming from Africa to America.

05:14.943 --> 05:17.612
Sheldon, that's
completely inappropriate.

05:17.614 --> 05:20.481
You can't keep comparing
yourself to a slave.

05:21.667 --> 05:23.167
Yes, Miss Amy.

05:26.288 --> 05:28.172
I can't believe you're
married to that idiot.

05:28.174 --> 05:30.658
Ugh, would you stop?
We just did it as a goof.

05:30.660 --> 05:32.210
Well, a goof or not,
you're actually married.

05:32.212 --> 05:34.011
You need to get
this taken care of.

05:34.013 --> 05:36.464
I will. Why are you
making this such a big deal?

05:36.466 --> 05:38.599
Oh, oh, oh, I have a reason.

05:38.601 --> 05:41.519
It could be because
you said yes to marrying Zack,

05:41.521 --> 05:43.137
but every time
Leonard's proposed,

05:43.139 --> 05:44.639
he's gotten a resounding no.

05:46.692 --> 05:49.811
Yeah, that's just
off the top of my head.

05:49.813 --> 05:51.646
So how do I undo this?

05:51.648 --> 05:53.147
I'm hoping you can
get an annulment.

05:53.149 --> 05:54.699
It's just like
it never happened.

05:54.701 --> 05:56.400
Great, well, what
do I have to do?

05:56.402 --> 05:58.069
It says here you can
get an annulment

05:58.071 --> 05:59.871
if any of the following
conditions are met.

05:59.873 --> 06:01.873
"Were you unable
to consummate the marriage?"

06:01.875 --> 06:03.825
(cackles) Penny? Next.

06:05.694 --> 06:08.329
"Is there any evidence
of fraud, bigamy,

06:08.331 --> 06:09.914
want of understanding?"

06:09.916 --> 06:10.965
"Want of understanding?"

06:10.967 --> 06:11.999
What does that even mean?

06:12.001 --> 06:15.035
Ding, ding, ding.
We have a winner.

06:16.204 --> 06:17.755
Thanks for saving the day.

06:17.757 --> 06:18.873
Ah, no problem.

06:18.875 --> 06:20.040
It wouldn't be Thanksgiving

06:20.042 --> 06:23.210
without an Indian
providing the food.

06:24.847 --> 06:27.214
Uh, now, where does your mom
keep the Crisco?

06:27.216 --> 06:28.349
Um, I don't know.

06:28.351 --> 06:30.184
Probably in a wad in her cheek.

06:31.854 --> 06:34.605
I'll help Raj in here. Why don't
you go keep my dad company?

06:34.607 --> 06:37.074
Oh, he doesn't want me in there.
I'm the creepy little guy

06:37.076 --> 06:39.393
who has sex with his daughter.

06:41.547 --> 06:43.998
Don't be silly, he loves you.
Does he?

06:44.000 --> 06:46.534
Okay, he cares about you a lot.
Really?

06:46.536 --> 06:49.620
I do crap for you
all the time. Get out there.

06:51.824 --> 06:55.242
(crowd cheers, whistle blows)

06:55.244 --> 06:59.046
So your wife's in Arizona
with the grandkids?

06:59.048 --> 07:00.715
Uh-huh.

07:02.968 --> 07:05.252
You know, my mom's been to...
(clears throat) Arizona.

07:05.254 --> 07:07.939
She rode one of those mules
down in the Grand Canyon.

07:07.941 --> 07:10.608
(chuckles) Long story short,
they had to shoot it.

07:15.197 --> 07:17.097
(whispers):
'Cause she's so fat.

07:19.451 --> 07:21.569
(doorbell rings)

07:21.571 --> 07:24.038
I'll get the door
while you finish laughing.

07:27.326 --> 07:28.826
Hey, guys.

07:28.828 --> 07:29.827
Happy Thanksgiving.

07:29.829 --> 07:31.412
It smells wonderful.

07:31.414 --> 07:33.664
Is anyone slaving away
in the kitchen?

07:33.666 --> 07:35.115
Because I, too, know...
Sheldon.

07:37.419 --> 07:39.253
Here. Thank you for having us.

07:39.255 --> 07:40.287
(scoffs)
What's with you?

07:40.289 --> 07:41.472
Oh, she's mad at <i>me</i>

07:41.474 --> 07:43.841
because she just found out
she's married to Zack.

07:43.843 --> 07:44.842
Really?

07:44.844 --> 07:46.811
That dumb-ass
she used to date?

07:46.813 --> 07:49.430
(laughs):
That's hysterical.

07:49.432 --> 07:52.934
I can't believe I felt bad
for opening this in the car.

07:58.190 --> 07:59.941
You need any help?

07:59.943 --> 08:02.610
Uh, yeah, can you, uh, reach
that, uh, gravy boat up there?

08:02.612 --> 08:03.978
Uh, sure.
Great.

08:03.980 --> 08:06.247
That makes one of you.

08:07.699 --> 08:10.985
Okay, we have a lot to do
and not much time to do it.

08:10.987 --> 08:13.588
Bernadette, you're on corn,
gravy and yam detail.

08:13.590 --> 08:14.989
Amy, you're on
rolls, cranberries

08:14.991 --> 08:17.351
and making sure Bernadette stays
away from the marshmallows.

08:18.543 --> 08:20.962
That's right, I see you.

08:22.180 --> 08:23.781
Okay, if you have
any questions,

08:23.783 --> 08:25.483
I'll be over here
basting my ass off.

08:25.485 --> 08:27.551
Focus is key.

08:27.553 --> 08:30.221
Did you guys know Penny
married Zack three years ago?

08:30.223 --> 08:32.023
What?
Wha...?

08:37.511 --> 08:39.013
You ever play football?

08:39.015 --> 08:40.615
A little in college.

08:40.616 --> 08:41.649
You?

08:41.650 --> 08:42.783
No.

08:42.784 --> 08:45.453
But I did get tackled
in the hallway once.

08:45.455 --> 08:47.288
(chuckles)

08:47.290 --> 08:50.157
The whole school cheered.

08:52.828 --> 08:54.211
Hey, I found the,
uh, court papers

08:54.213 --> 08:55.696
that you and Zack
need to fill out.

08:55.698 --> 08:57.415
I'll print them when we get home.
Fine.

08:57.417 --> 08:59.700
And we can just put this
whole thing behind us.

08:59.702 --> 09:00.668
Are you done?

09:00.670 --> 09:02.470
What?
Look, I get it, I screwed up.

09:02.472 --> 09:04.171
Is this all we're gonna talk
about the rest of the day?

09:04.173 --> 09:05.423
Why are you mad at me?

09:05.425 --> 09:07.091
You're the one that
did the stupid thing.

09:07.093 --> 09:08.726
I'm just trying to fix it.
Ugh!

09:08.728 --> 09:10.127
I need some air.

09:10.129 --> 09:11.679
Well... Penny.

09:11.681 --> 09:13.547
Now, I don't know the
first thing about women,

09:13.549 --> 09:15.383
but I would not follow her.

09:18.353 --> 09:20.571
Listen to Stretch.

09:22.000 --> 09:28.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

09:29.632 --> 09:31.717
How am I
the bad guy?

09:31.719 --> 09:34.486
She's the one who married
someone else. I'm the victim.

09:34.488 --> 09:38.240
Sounds like Zack's the victim.
You're sleeping with his wife.

09:40.193 --> 09:43.328
I've kept my marriage
together for 35 years.

09:43.330 --> 09:44.813
Can I weigh in here?

09:44.815 --> 09:45.914
Sure.

09:45.916 --> 09:47.982
I'm trying to watch the game.
Shut up.

09:49.485 --> 09:51.019
Oh!

09:51.021 --> 09:54.022
How do you not make
a first down there?

09:54.024 --> 09:55.791
They passed against
a nickel defense.

09:55.793 --> 09:57.559
They should have run it
off-tackle.

10:00.296 --> 10:02.197
How the hell
do you know that?

10:02.199 --> 10:03.832
My father loved football.

10:03.834 --> 10:05.550
He always made me watch it

10:05.552 --> 10:08.320
before I was allowed
to do my homework.

10:08.322 --> 10:09.337
PENNY: Well, you'll
be happy

10:09.339 --> 10:10.839
to know I just
spoke to Zack

10:10.841 --> 10:12.524
and he's willing to
sign the court papers.

10:12.526 --> 10:13.842
He's on his way here now.

10:13.844 --> 10:16.678
Wait, you invited him here?
Yeah.

10:16.680 --> 10:18.513
I'm getting ready
to weigh in again.

10:18.515 --> 10:20.181
Come on.

10:21.117 --> 10:23.869
What do you think
they ought to do now?

10:23.871 --> 10:26.187
I would throw a quick slant
to a wideout,

10:26.189 --> 10:28.657
given that the defense
is showing blitz.

10:28.659 --> 10:31.793
Oh, I love a good blitz,
especially with sour cream.

10:34.380 --> 10:36.131
(laughing):
Get it?

10:36.133 --> 10:38.500
'Cause it sounds like "blintz."

10:39.385 --> 10:41.753
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Did someone say "blintz"?!

10:42.922 --> 10:44.038
I just don't
understand

10:44.040 --> 10:45.540
why you invited
him here today.

10:45.542 --> 10:46.641
Because you wouldn't
shut up about it.

10:46.643 --> 10:48.143
When I called him,
he had nothing to do,

10:48.145 --> 10:49.177
so I just thought it would...

10:49.179 --> 10:50.979
Hey, guys, I'm trying
to cook in here.

10:50.981 --> 10:52.314
Oh, sorry.
We'll keep it down.

10:52.316 --> 10:55.066
No, no, speak up.

10:55.068 --> 10:56.518
I'm about to use the blender,

10:56.520 --> 10:58.320
and I don't want
to miss anything.

10:59.155 --> 11:01.222
Well, you might have
to cook for one more

11:01.224 --> 11:02.407
because she
invited Zack.

11:02.409 --> 11:04.242
BERNADETTE: What?
AMY: Ooh!

11:05.411 --> 11:07.228
My, my.

11:07.230 --> 11:10.832
The plot, like my gravy,
thickens.

11:15.188 --> 11:17.422
I don't care for your
mother's bathroom.

11:17.424 --> 11:19.624
There's not an angle
to do one's business

11:19.626 --> 11:22.243
without a clown figurine
staring at you.

11:23.629 --> 11:26.014
That's why I sit.
(chuckles)

11:26.016 --> 11:28.433
Yeah, that's why.

11:30.586 --> 11:32.771
You remember
the Thanksgiving game

11:32.773 --> 11:34.756
when it snowed
in Dallas?

11:34.758 --> 11:38.393
1993-- Leon Lett blew the game
in the final seconds

11:38.395 --> 11:40.362
and the Dolphins
emerged victorious.

11:40.364 --> 11:43.365
Then I finally got to do
my calculus.

11:43.367 --> 11:46.818
I was so pissed,
I wanted to shoot my TV.

11:46.820 --> 11:48.737
So was my dad.

11:48.739 --> 11:51.039
And then he did.

11:51.958 --> 11:53.875
Anyone need a beer?
Yeah.

11:53.877 --> 11:56.277
Thank God.

11:56.279 --> 11:59.214
So, does your dad
still live in Texas?

11:59.216 --> 12:01.833
No. He died when I was 14.

12:03.019 --> 12:05.003
I'm sorry to hear that.

12:05.005 --> 12:07.722
So was the man who owned
the local liquor store.

12:09.008 --> 12:12.194
He cried and cried.

12:12.196 --> 12:13.895
Here you go.

12:13.897 --> 12:15.931
Oh, thanks.

12:15.933 --> 12:18.733
So, if your dad died
when you were 14,

12:18.735 --> 12:21.903
you were never old enough
to have a beer with the man.

12:21.905 --> 12:23.188
No, sir.

12:23.190 --> 12:26.157
He did try to give me one
for my high school graduation,

12:26.159 --> 12:29.494
but I was 11 and my mom said no.

12:33.633 --> 12:36.001
Well, you're having one with me.

12:40.756 --> 12:42.374
All right.

12:44.010 --> 12:45.677
To your dad.

12:49.465 --> 12:53.218
I never had a beer
with my dad, either.

12:56.505 --> 12:59.224
Do you mind?
We're having a moment here.

13:06.983 --> 13:09.234
I can't believe Penny's
married to Zack.

13:09.236 --> 13:10.936
Wonder what she saw
in that guy.

13:10.938 --> 13:12.437
I don't know.

13:12.439 --> 13:14.456
He's sweet, he's tall, handsome.

13:14.458 --> 13:16.374
Broad shoulders, good hair.

13:16.376 --> 13:18.910
Hmm. Wonder what she
sees in Leonard.

13:22.014 --> 13:23.498
How's it going out there?

13:23.500 --> 13:27.218
Sheldon and your dad are bonding
and completely ignoring me.

13:27.220 --> 13:29.304
I know how you feel.

13:29.306 --> 13:33.141
Sheldon ignored me for a week
when he got that Roomba vacuum.

13:34.543 --> 13:36.878
I kick it when he's not looking.

13:38.931 --> 13:40.231
What are they doing?

13:40.233 --> 13:44.686
They're drinking beer
and watching football.

13:44.688 --> 13:46.054
They don't want me.

13:46.056 --> 13:47.155
What do you mean?

13:47.157 --> 13:48.640
Well, Sheldon
started talking

13:48.642 --> 13:50.942
about how his dad
isn't alive anymore,

13:50.944 --> 13:52.393
and they were toasting,
and I tried

13:52.395 --> 13:53.862
to tell them about how sad I was

13:53.864 --> 13:54.996
when my dad abandoned...
(doorbell rings)

13:54.998 --> 13:56.848
AMY:
Zack's here!

13:56.850 --> 13:59.117
Stir the gravy.

14:01.370 --> 14:03.538
Sorry. I really want
to hear how sad you are.

14:03.540 --> 14:05.957
I'll be back in like five,
ten minutes.

14:10.012 --> 14:12.547
Sorry she made you come
over here on a holiday.

14:12.549 --> 14:14.599
It's all right.
I didn't have anything going on.

14:14.601 --> 14:16.217
Plus, Penny told me
we're married,

14:16.219 --> 14:18.837
and Thanksgiving's a time
to be with family.

14:19.722 --> 14:20.689
Yeah, okay, great.

14:20.691 --> 14:21.891
Can we just get
this over with?

14:21.892 --> 14:24.809
Yeah, uh, you guys
have to sign here and here.

14:24.811 --> 14:26.611
On Monday, we'll file
for the annulment,

14:26.613 --> 14:28.446
and this "marriage"
will be over.

14:28.448 --> 14:29.781
Okay.

14:29.783 --> 14:32.233
I don't know
if I want to sign it.

14:32.235 --> 14:34.452
Ooh. Ooh.
Ooh.

14:36.455 --> 14:37.872
Why won't you sign it?

14:37.874 --> 14:41.609
I just think splitting up
can be rough on kids.

14:42.495 --> 14:43.745
We don't have any kids.

14:43.747 --> 14:45.380
Are you sure?
'Cause you didn't know

14:45.382 --> 14:47.132
we were married
until this morning.

14:49.385 --> 14:50.835
Okay, look, Zack, come on.

14:50.837 --> 14:53.004
You know neither of us
thought this was real.

14:53.006 --> 14:55.974
I mean, we were married
by an Elvis impersonator.

14:55.976 --> 14:57.458
Of course it was
an impersonator.

14:57.460 --> 15:00.145
We could never afford
a real Elvis.

15:02.481 --> 15:04.849
You married him
instead of me?

15:04.851 --> 15:06.651
Good call.

15:06.653 --> 15:08.236
Sign the papers.

15:08.238 --> 15:09.521
Hang on.
You know what?

15:09.523 --> 15:11.406
You have been a jerk
about this all day.

15:11.408 --> 15:12.907
You always do this--
whenever I mess up,

15:12.909 --> 15:14.909
you're right there to make me
feel even worse about it.

15:14.911 --> 15:15.977
That is not true.

15:15.979 --> 15:17.145
Yeah, we could've
waited till Monday,

15:17.147 --> 15:18.697
signed the papers,
this all would have been over.

15:18.699 --> 15:20.281
You're the one who
invited him here.

15:20.283 --> 15:21.866
Oh, there you go again--
just another mistake

15:21.868 --> 15:22.917
you're throwing in my face.

15:22.919 --> 15:24.652
Not cool, bro.

15:26.455 --> 15:27.922
I'm starting to think

15:27.924 --> 15:30.542
you're not the kind of guy
I want dating my wife.

15:32.378 --> 15:34.328
LEONARD:
Yeah, well,

15:34.330 --> 15:35.930
she's not gonna be
your wife for long.

15:35.932 --> 15:38.833
Oh, no. Are you dying?

15:39.685 --> 15:41.886
I'm about to. Sign the paper.

15:43.672 --> 15:47.609
Know what they say:
"Happy wife, happy life."

15:48.811 --> 15:50.361
Let's eat.

15:53.783 --> 15:58.653
(burping): Two, three,
eight, four, six.

16:01.457 --> 16:03.491
That's all I can do
without throwing up.

16:03.493 --> 16:05.076
(gasping)

16:05.078 --> 16:06.694
That is not what I expected

16:06.696 --> 16:09.664
when you said you
were gonna burp "pie."

16:11.050 --> 16:13.585
MRS. WOLOWITZ:
Did somebody say "pie"?!

16:14.587 --> 16:16.171
I don't know what's scarier:

16:16.173 --> 16:17.672
the bathroom clowns

16:17.674 --> 16:20.475
or the woman
that put them there.

16:21.543 --> 16:25.213
All I know is you can only fit
one of her in a car.

16:25.215 --> 16:27.048
(laughing)

16:28.350 --> 16:30.068
And there's the clown
that came out of her.

16:30.070 --> 16:32.403
(laughing)

16:35.057 --> 16:37.525
I really didn't want
to come here,

16:37.527 --> 16:39.444
but this is shaping up to be

16:39.446 --> 16:41.996
one of the best Thanksgivings
I've had in a long time.

16:41.998 --> 16:44.232
Me, too.

16:44.234 --> 16:47.235
Hey. Howie says you've been
making fun of him all day!

16:47.237 --> 16:48.419
Now, both of you
apologize

16:48.421 --> 16:50.088
right now!

16:50.956 --> 16:53.124
She's so tiny.

16:56.712 --> 16:59.180
(laughing):
It's funny when she's mad.

17:02.401 --> 17:03.968
All right, mister,
I think you owe

17:03.970 --> 17:06.805
Howard and Bernadette
an apology.

17:08.089 --> 17:11.943
Perhaps you're right.

17:11.944 --> 17:13.426
I'm sorry for my behavior.

17:13.429 --> 17:15.613
I've had alcohol,
and it's caused me

17:15.615 --> 17:16.815
to be inappropriate.

17:16.817 --> 17:18.817
It's okay.
Don't worry about it.

17:18.819 --> 17:20.734
Thank you.

17:20.737 --> 17:22.237
Ain't she great?

17:22.239 --> 17:23.320
Mmm.

17:23.323 --> 17:24.656
(chuckling):
Sheldon.

17:24.657 --> 17:26.607
Now, how's about you get us
a couple of beers?

17:43.828 --> 17:45.145
Thanks again
for cooking.

17:45.147 --> 17:46.663
AMY: Yeah, everything
was delicious.

17:46.665 --> 17:47.664
Well, I couldn't

17:47.666 --> 17:50.134
have done it without
my two favorite girls.

17:50.136 --> 17:51.151
Aw.

17:51.153 --> 17:53.370
Martha Stewart and Rachael Ray.

17:57.175 --> 17:59.843
Hey, Sheldon, what do you say
we go outside

17:59.845 --> 18:01.929
and throw around
the old pigskin?

18:02.797 --> 18:04.765
This is a Jewish house.

18:04.767 --> 18:06.517
I don't think they have pigskin.

18:08.987 --> 18:11.939
MRS. WOLOWITZ:  Did so!

18:13.141 --> 18:15.392
Hey, honey, I'm
sorry about today.

18:15.394 --> 18:17.511
And I promise, next
time I get married,

18:17.513 --> 18:19.062
it won't be a joke.

18:19.064 --> 18:20.680
It'll be for love.

18:20.682 --> 18:22.816
Or money.

18:25.770 --> 18:27.121
I'm sorry, too.

18:27.123 --> 18:28.655
ZACK:
Don't be.

18:28.657 --> 18:29.656
It's my fault.

18:29.658 --> 18:31.074
I was a terrible husband.

18:32.710 --> 18:35.379
I was never around.

18:37.198 --> 18:39.216
I know I'm hard on you,

18:39.218 --> 18:42.002
but you're not the worst
son-in-law in the world.

18:42.004 --> 18:44.922
Mike, that's the nicest thing
you've ever said to me.

18:44.924 --> 18:47.724
Well, I'm drunk.

18:50.995 --> 18:53.230
I just vomited
on a lot of clowns.
