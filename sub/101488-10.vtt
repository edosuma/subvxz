WEBVTT

00:20.437 --> 00:22.355
What a catering gig, huh?

00:22.439 --> 00:23.982
The Glencrest Yacht Club

00:24.065 --> 00:26.109
-Christmas Yacht Parade.
-Yay.

00:26.192 --> 00:27.569
Yeah, they put Christmas lights on boats

00:27.652 --> 00:28.695
and sail them through the harbor,

00:28.778 --> 00:30.447
and the whole town can come.

00:30.530 --> 00:32.866
And there’s a Santa,
and they do Hanukkah, too,

00:32.949 --> 00:35.201
which is nice, ‘cause
let’s just say the yacht club

00:35.285 --> 00:36.619
didn’t always do Hanukkah.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.079
Anyway, it’s gonna be great.

00:38.163 --> 00:39.497
Yeah, and I can’t wait to try out my

00:39.581 --> 00:42.667
"I’m Brie-ing of a
White Crisp-mas" sliders.

00:42.751 --> 00:44.377
With Brie, and crispy onions.

00:44.461 --> 00:45.879
It's pretty complicated.

00:45.962 --> 00:47.839
I might be nervous and trying too hard.

00:47.922 --> 00:49.299
No.

00:49.382 --> 00:50.508
I’m actually not sure why the yacht club

00:50.592 --> 00:51.801
asked us to do this.

00:51.885 --> 00:53.303
I mean, the other restaurants they invited

00:53.386 --> 00:56.139
are pretty impressive, and we’re us.

00:56.222 --> 00:57.557
It’s a little strange, right?

00:57.640 --> 00:59.184
-Not strange.
-Pretty strange.

00:59.267 --> 01:00.643
Strangely pretty?

01:00.727 --> 01:02.771
I mean, how does the yacht club
even know about us?

01:02.854 --> 01:04.898
The person I’ve been coordinating with
wasn’t sure.

01:04.981 --> 01:06.816
Stop looking for reasons to worry, Bob.

01:06.900 --> 01:09.986
Mm. I’m just not
used to good stuff happening.

01:10.070 --> 01:11.654
Think of it like a gift from Santa.

01:11.738 --> 01:14.157
If Santa brings something nice,
you don’t ask questions.

01:14.240 --> 01:15.784
You take it and keep your mouth shut.

01:15.867 --> 01:18.078
Yeah, I do not want to know
where Santa gets all that stuff.

01:18.161 --> 01:20.205
-The elves’ workshop?
-That’s a front.

01:20.288 --> 01:22.290
-Hey, Bob.
-Hey Trev.

01:22.374 --> 01:24.501
-Happy holidays.
-Happy holidays.

01:24.584 --> 01:26.836
-Ha.
-Okay, bye.

01:26.920 --> 01:29.089
-Zoom! (laughs)
-Ah, good one, Jimmy.

01:29.172 --> 01:31.383
I get it, humiliating and dominating me.

01:31.466 --> 01:33.802
Well, you were asking for it
by standing there.

01:33.885 --> 01:36.304
-Ugh. Jimmy.
-All right. Come on, kids, let's go.

01:36.388 --> 01:38.932
-Give Trev his dignity.
-You don’t need pants, Trev.

01:39.015 --> 01:40.433
Not with those knees.

01:42.268 --> 01:44.062
Hello.
Can I help you?

01:44.145 --> 01:46.981
Yeah, we’re, uh, caterers,
for the yacht parade.

01:47.065 --> 01:49.651
Caterers?
You’ll be setting up in the marina.

01:49.734 --> 01:53.488
Please go around the building.
Inside is for members only.

01:53.571 --> 01:55.782
-"Members" as in "wieners"?
-Excuse me?

01:55.865 --> 01:57.826
Uh, n-nothing. Uh, we’ll go around.
Thank you.

01:57.909 --> 01:59.786
Look at us, going around a yacht club.

01:59.869 --> 02:02.539
-Afternoon.
-Mr. President. Good afternoon.

02:02.622 --> 02:04.624
Wait, uh, that was the club president?

02:04.708 --> 02:05.875
Uh, could I speak to him?

02:05.959 --> 02:07.961
I’m just curious how you guys picked us.

02:08.044 --> 02:10.296
The president’s really busy right now.

02:10.380 --> 02:12.340
-Good for him.
-Bob, come on, we got to set up.

02:12.424 --> 02:14.342
-Um, uh, okay.
-Try not to step

02:14.426 --> 02:16.845
on the ground too much.
Thank you.

02:21.725 --> 02:23.935
Oh, ho, ho.
Hello, friends.

02:24.019 --> 02:25.353
-Hey, Teddy.
-Hi.

02:25.437 --> 02:27.439
It’s me, Teddy...
Oh, you all knew.

02:27.522 --> 02:28.857
That’s disappointing, somehow.

02:28.940 --> 02:30.775
So you’re the yacht club Santa?

02:30.859 --> 02:33.361
Yeah. I-I was doing some work
at the club and they asked me.

02:33.445 --> 02:35.280
The guy they were gonna use
got in shape this year,

02:35.363 --> 02:37.907
to "stay alive longer."

02:37.991 --> 02:39.784
His loss, my gain, right, guys?

02:39.868 --> 02:41.536
-Mm-hmm.
-Well, congrats.

02:41.619 --> 02:42.954
Got to admit, I’m nervous.

02:43.038 --> 02:44.706
I mean, I’m on the <i>Santa Schooner.</i>

02:44.789 --> 02:48.084
Me.
I’m the guy on the <i>Santa Schooner.</i>

02:48.168 --> 02:50.211
-What’s the <i>Santa Schooner?</i>
-What’s the <i>Santa Schooner?</i>

02:50.295 --> 02:52.088
The last yacht in the yacht parade.

02:52.172 --> 02:54.674
We come right up to the dock,
and I step off

02:54.758 --> 02:57.677
with a big bag of fancy presents
donated by club members.

02:57.761 --> 03:00.764
-Fancy what now?
-And I go over and I get welcomed
by the mayor.

03:00.847 --> 03:02.515
The mayor?
Bob, the mayor.

03:02.599 --> 03:04.184
-The mayor!
-I heard him, Lin.

03:04.267 --> 03:06.269
And then I hand out presents
to kids on the dock.

03:06.353 --> 03:09.147
Eh, but I don’t know
if I have what it takes to be Santa.

03:09.230 --> 03:12.525
The guy’s so organized with that list
and the checking it twice.

03:12.609 --> 03:15.195
And those rosy cheeks.
A-Are my cheeks even rosy?

03:15.278 --> 03:17.947
-They’re ruddy.
-Teddy, about those presents.

03:18.031 --> 03:20.033
Uh-huh.
Some really nice stuff.

03:20.116 --> 03:22.744
Dollies, action figures,
doing all types of actions.

03:22.827 --> 03:24.454
-Intriguing.
-What else?

03:24.537 --> 03:26.456
One member owns
a remote control car company,

03:26.539 --> 03:29.292
and he donated a few cars
from his private reserve.

03:29.376 --> 03:31.753
-They go just a little too fast.
-How fast?

03:31.836 --> 03:34.339
Ram it into your foot at full speed,
you’re losing a toenail.

03:34.422 --> 03:36.424
-Holy crap, I want that.
-Whoa.
-Hmm.

03:36.508 --> 03:37.967
But the good stuff’s gonna run out.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.469
After that it’s just a bunch of erasers

03:39.552 --> 03:40.804
donated by a defense lawyer.

03:40.887 --> 03:43.139
They say "We Make Your Mistakes Go Away."

03:43.223 --> 03:45.266
Sounds like a great
lawyer and a bad present.

03:45.350 --> 03:47.602
If you want a good present,
you better get in line early.

03:47.686 --> 03:49.270
All those kids are waiting already.

03:49.354 --> 03:51.940
-Mom, Dad, it’s been real.
-Louise, kids, no.

03:52.023 --> 03:53.525
Yeah, sorry, guys.
We didn’t know about

03:53.608 --> 03:54.818
the whole present thing.

03:54.901 --> 03:56.695
And we need your help
prepping the sliders.

03:56.778 --> 03:58.113
The recipe’s pretty involved.

03:58.196 --> 04:00.115
Oh, my God.
There’s free presents for kids,

04:00.198 --> 04:01.700
and what are we?

04:01.783 --> 04:03.743
-That’s right, we’re kids!
-Teen kids, some of us.

04:03.827 --> 04:05.453
And Gene kids.

04:05.537 --> 04:07.497
But it’s also fun to work with your family

04:07.580 --> 04:10.709
and get presents in two days
at Regular People Christmas.

04:10.792 --> 04:13.003
No, it isn't!

04:13.086 --> 04:15.213
-Sorry. We love you.
-No, you don't!

04:15.296 --> 04:17.507
-Tina!
-All right, we better get set up.

04:17.590 --> 04:19.175
-Uh, good luck, Teddy.
-Uh, hey.

04:19.259 --> 04:21.177
For the rest of the night,
call me Santa, okay?

04:21.261 --> 04:22.971
-I’ll try.
-I’ll try what?

04:23.054 --> 04:24.806
I’ll try, Santa.

04:24.889 --> 04:27.308
Maybe your eyes could light up
like a child’s when you say it?

04:27.392 --> 04:29.310
-Teddy.
-Yep, I’m gonna go. Bye, guys.

04:29.394 --> 04:30.687
Oh, what a night.

04:30.770 --> 04:32.814
We got twinkly lights, floaty boats,

04:32.897 --> 04:34.649
-the mayor’s gonna be here.
-Yep.

04:34.733 --> 04:36.693
I still don’t get
why you love the mayor so much.

04:36.776 --> 04:38.945
Because he’s got that walk.
He’s like...

04:39.029 --> 04:40.739
(chanting):
"I’m the mayor, look at me.

04:40.822 --> 04:43.450
-Helping my community."
-Uh-huh.

04:43.533 --> 04:46.619
Oh.
Uh, Mr. uh... uh, President man?

04:46.703 --> 04:48.246
Sorry.
I-I don’t know your name.

04:48.329 --> 04:50.331
-Mr. President Man is fine.
-Oh, okay.

04:50.415 --> 04:52.125
-Uh, do you have a second?
-Not really.

04:52.208 --> 04:54.544
We’re doing a little ceremony later
for tonight’s vendors--

04:54.627 --> 04:57.589
like yourself--
and I need to prepare my remarks.

04:57.672 --> 04:59.549
Which is what I call the drinks
I’m gonna have.

05:01.259 --> 05:02.677
Ha, ha.
Well, I’ll be quick.

05:02.761 --> 05:04.554
Uh, my name is Bob Belcher.
This is my family.

05:04.637 --> 05:06.473
-Hi.
-My liege.

05:06.556 --> 05:09.726
I was wondering, uh,
how did you hear about us?

05:09.809 --> 05:11.686
Well, like all the vendors,
you came highly recommended

05:11.770 --> 05:13.396
by someone in our yachting community.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.899
You see, Bob?
It’s not the crazy, evil plan

05:15.982 --> 05:17.650
of someone out to get you somehow.

05:17.734 --> 05:19.069
Who recommended us?

05:19.152 --> 05:21.613
-Hmm. Who was that?
-JIMMY: Hey, look out!

05:21.696 --> 05:23.323
Expensive boat coming through.

05:23.406 --> 05:25.075
Oh, that’s right.
It was Jimmy Pesto.

05:25.158 --> 05:26.576
Jimmy Pesto?

05:26.659 --> 05:28.828
He took out a second mortgage for this.

05:28.912 --> 05:30.163
Shush.

05:30.246 --> 05:32.207
Oh, God.
It is the crazy, evil plan

05:32.290 --> 05:33.750
of someone out to get me somehow.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.877
-Bob...
-Linda, this is a trap.

05:35.960 --> 05:38.046
Great.
A festive Christmas trap with my family.

05:38.129 --> 05:40.256
Aw, family.

05:42.342 --> 05:45.804
Ugh, Jimmy.
I knew this job was too good to be true.

05:45.887 --> 05:47.472
Bob, don’t be paranoid.

05:47.555 --> 05:50.058
-(sighs) He’s coming over here.
-LOUISE: Great.

05:50.141 --> 05:51.685
-We’re gonna check out the gift situation.
-No.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.436
-Kids, you got to prep.
-We finished.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.271
-What? Already?
-It’s a Christmas miracle,

05:55.355 --> 05:56.648
and also we went really fast

05:56.731 --> 05:57.899
and don’t look too closely at our work.

05:57.982 --> 05:59.359
Need anything else, or you’re good?

05:59.442 --> 06:01.027
-You’re good? You’re good.
-JIMMY: Hey, hey.

06:01.111 --> 06:03.405
Look who it is, the Ghost of Christmas...

06:04.823 --> 06:06.157
-(laughs)
-Ha. Fart ghost.

06:06.241 --> 06:08.493
<i>You</i> recommended us for this, Jimmy?

06:08.576 --> 06:10.829
Yeah, the president and I are bro buddies.

06:10.912 --> 06:12.747
He needed vendors,
so I threw out some names.

06:12.831 --> 06:15.083
He’s definitely gonna
have to make you a member now.

06:15.166 --> 06:17.335
H-Hey, I <i>am</i> a member, practically.

06:17.419 --> 06:19.379
Top of the wait list.
Up top.

06:19.462 --> 06:20.797
-Nuh-uh.
-Down low?

06:20.880 --> 06:22.757
-Nope.
-But Christmas.

06:22.841 --> 06:25.010
So, you did this
out of the goodness of your heart?

06:25.093 --> 06:26.428
Yeah.
‘Tis the season, right?

06:26.511 --> 06:27.762
Uh, but, uh, why don’t you just worry

06:27.846 --> 06:29.514
about your tiny burgers, Bob?

06:29.597 --> 06:31.141
Ha.
Cause sliders are small.

06:31.224 --> 06:32.892
Why don’t you have a booth, Jimmy?

06:32.976 --> 06:35.395
I got to mingle.
I mean, these are my people.

06:35.478 --> 06:38.523
-Eh. Could be, if you get in.
-Would you ju... Listen.

06:38.606 --> 06:40.191
I know you’re up to something, Jimmy.

06:40.275 --> 06:42.277
-Do you hear me?!
-(chuckles): He’s fine.

06:42.360 --> 06:43.653
Happy holidays.

06:43.737 --> 06:45.697
Ugh.
So many kids in line.

06:45.780 --> 06:48.366
Yep, we’re getting erasers.
We’re eraser children.

06:48.450 --> 06:51.202
Sweet siblings,
we won’t be waiting in line.

06:51.286 --> 06:52.620
Waiting is for people who aren’t

06:52.704 --> 06:55.206
close personal friends with Santa.

06:55.290 --> 06:57.792
About to board
the old <i>Santa Schooner,</i> huh, Teddy?

06:57.876 --> 06:59.210
(chuckles):
I mean, Santa.

06:59.294 --> 07:01.171
-How you feeling?
-Still nervous.

07:01.254 --> 07:03.423
I-I thought I was
having a heart attack, but I wasn’t.

07:03.506 --> 07:06.676
Great, great. So you know
we’ve always thought of you as...

07:06.760 --> 07:09.095
kind of a father figure,
mixed with an uncle.

07:09.179 --> 07:10.555
With a splash of stranger.

07:10.638 --> 07:11.806
Just enough to keep it interesting.

07:11.890 --> 07:13.016
Wow. Okay.

07:13.099 --> 07:15.935
So, Uncle Father Santa Teddy,

07:16.019 --> 07:18.313
you’ve got a yacht
full of presents to give to kids,

07:18.396 --> 07:19.731
and we are kids.

07:19.814 --> 07:21.316
So why don’t you go on the yacht,

07:21.399 --> 07:24.486
grab a primo gift or three,
and, uh, do what Santa does best?

07:24.569 --> 07:27.822
-Fly?
-No. I’m saying give some gifts to us.

07:27.906 --> 07:29.532
Oh.
W-Would Santa do that?

07:29.616 --> 07:31.368
Uh, what about those kids waiting in line?

07:31.451 --> 07:33.286
-For hours, some of them.
-Yeah, Louise.

07:33.370 --> 07:35.121
-What about the kids waiting in line?
-Seriously?

07:35.205 --> 07:37.707
Don’t talk to us
about waiting in line, okay?

07:37.791 --> 07:40.627
-We’ve been waiting in line all our lives.
-Preach.

07:40.710 --> 07:43.254
You’ve seen what it’s like for us,
Uncle Father Santa Teddy,

07:43.338 --> 07:45.090
in our so-called house.

07:45.173 --> 07:48.760
You don’t have to do it,
Uncle Santa Father...

07:48.843 --> 07:50.762
-uh, sorry, I forget your title.
-Tina.

07:50.845 --> 07:53.431
Uh, what would Santa do?
What would he do?

07:53.515 --> 07:55.517
I’m sorry, kids.
I feel weird about this.

07:55.600 --> 07:58.436
I got to go, and-and not because
I have nervous diarrhea.

07:58.520 --> 08:00.355
Hey, does this yacht have a toilet?

08:00.438 --> 08:02.565
And not because I have nervous diarrhea.

08:02.649 --> 08:04.901
Ugh.
Now what are we gonna do?

08:04.984 --> 08:06.611
Go back and work

08:06.695 --> 08:08.822
and try to make the best
of what little we have?

08:08.905 --> 08:12.534
Well, that’s a sad thing
to hear a kid say at Christmastime.

08:12.617 --> 08:14.619
Hey, Gus.
Don’t worry about us, you enjoy yourself.

08:14.703 --> 08:16.329
Oh, I’m enjoying myself.

08:16.413 --> 08:19.833
I’m having craft beers
and chicken satay and craft beers.

08:19.916 --> 08:23.128
It-it’s okay, I’m not driving.
I took my dinghy.

08:23.211 --> 08:26.589
-I took my dinghy, too.
-(sighs) Let’s get back to the booth.

08:26.673 --> 08:30.051
But let’s take the long,
avoiding-work way. Bye, Gus.

08:30.135 --> 08:32.137
Bye, kids.
Ooh, what do we have here?

08:32.220 --> 08:35.265
Another drink ticket.
Merry Christmas to Gus!

08:35.348 --> 08:38.268
Oh, my God, Bob,
I just had a brain thought.

08:38.351 --> 08:40.020
What if the mayor
tries one of our burgers?

08:40.103 --> 08:41.604
-Uh-huh.
-He’ll love it!

08:41.688 --> 08:43.231
Next he’ll be hanging out
in the restaurant,

08:43.314 --> 08:44.941
asking us advice on city stuff,

08:45.025 --> 08:46.776
where to put buildings and whatnot.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.445
I always thought there should be one
right over there.

08:48.528 --> 08:50.947
-What is he up to?
-Huh? What? Who?

08:51.031 --> 08:53.825
Jimmy. I know he’s got something
up his stupid sleeve.

08:53.908 --> 08:57.328
He wants to embarrass me
then high-five all his rich friends.

08:57.412 --> 08:59.581
-Bob, you’re being crazy.
-Hmm.

08:59.664 --> 09:01.708
Anyway, Jimmy wants
to impress the yacht people.

09:01.791 --> 09:04.878
-He’s not gonna do some dumb prank.
-Wait. You’re right.

09:04.961 --> 09:06.963
-Yeah.
-That’s why Jimmy brought Trev.

09:07.047 --> 09:09.049
He-he’s gonna make Trev do it,

09:09.132 --> 09:11.384
and then, uh, Jimmy keeps his hands clean.

09:11.468 --> 09:13.553
-Uh, I’ll be back.
-Bobby, no.

09:13.636 --> 09:15.555
Don’t go starting something.
It’s Yacht-mas.

09:15.638 --> 09:18.558
It’s time for truth, Lin.
It’s truth o'clock.

09:18.641 --> 09:20.727
He’s okay.
He’s merry.

09:20.810 --> 09:22.479
He’s a yacht mess.

09:22.562 --> 09:24.314
Look, it’s Bob.

09:24.397 --> 09:26.524
-Hey Trev.
-Heh. Whatever, Bob.

09:26.608 --> 09:28.985
Hm. Jimmy’s not around.
Do you have to talk like that?

09:29.069 --> 09:32.072
Uh, yeah.
I have social anxiety, Bob.

09:32.155 --> 09:33.698
(sighs) Okay.
Uh, listen,

09:33.782 --> 09:35.700
I know you and Jimmy
have something planned.

09:35.784 --> 09:38.286
Probably something stupid and awful,

09:38.370 --> 09:39.996
but you shouldn’t do it.

09:40.080 --> 09:41.164
How’d you know about that?

09:41.247 --> 09:43.083
So there is something!
What-what is it?

09:43.166 --> 09:44.959
Bob?
Stop breathing on Trev.

09:45.043 --> 09:46.544
I know you’re up to something, Jimmy.

09:46.628 --> 09:48.254
-Trev just admitted it.
-What?

09:48.338 --> 09:50.131
-Ugh, I didn’t.
-Whatever it is,

09:50.215 --> 09:51.800
you’re not getting me tonight, Jimmy.

09:51.883 --> 09:54.010
Oh, loosen up, will you?
Especially your belt.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.428
(laughs)
‘Cause of your body.

09:55.512 --> 09:57.138
-Body.
-Zoom! (chuckles)

09:57.222 --> 09:59.307
Trev, come on. There’s a yacht
over here with a dirty name.

09:59.391 --> 10:01.059
-Classic. I love names.
-(snickering)

10:01.142 --> 10:02.686
Well, none of it’s gonna work, Jimmy.

10:02.769 --> 10:05.063
And-and I don’t even have a belt.
It’s elastic.

10:05.146 --> 10:07.982
And it fits fine, sort of.

10:08.066 --> 10:10.402
Wait.
Loosen your belt?

10:10.485 --> 10:12.445
(distorted): Zoom!

10:12.529 --> 10:14.364
Yes.
That’s it.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.741
He wants to pants me
in front of rich people.

10:16.825 --> 10:18.243
That monster.

10:18.326 --> 10:19.994
Not this time.
No, Jimmy.

10:20.078 --> 10:23.123
This time it’s gonna be your pants!

10:27.585 --> 10:29.254
We like to keep this walkway clear.

10:29.337 --> 10:31.423
-Oh. Uh, I’m sorry.
-You’re still on it.

10:31.506 --> 10:33.550
-Oh, okay, um...
-Thank you.

10:33.633 --> 10:35.885
-Here?
-Thank you.

10:39.973 --> 10:42.517
Aw, look at the boats, all lit up.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.769
Here you go.
Stocking stuffer for your mouth.

10:44.853 --> 10:47.230
Stuff it, in a good way.
Bob, what are you doing?

10:47.313 --> 10:50.400
I’m using bungee cords
to make myself impossible to pants.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.569
Yeah, Mom, what’s it look like he’s doing?

10:52.652 --> 10:54.320
Listen, I know you thought this job

10:54.404 --> 10:55.780
was too good to be true, and yeah,

10:55.864 --> 10:58.324
the Jimmy thing’s weird,
but you got to get a grip.

10:58.408 --> 11:01.703
I have a grip.
A firm grip, on my pants.

11:01.786 --> 11:03.121
-That’s my guy.
-I’m worried about Dad.

11:03.204 --> 11:04.539
I’m worried it took him this long

11:04.622 --> 11:06.666
to figure out he looks great
in bungee cords.

11:06.750 --> 11:08.209
Guys, do you see what I see?

11:08.293 --> 11:09.210
It's Gus.

11:09.294 --> 11:10.879
TINA:
Yep, that's Gus all right.

11:10.962 --> 11:13.757
-So you just want us
to watch Gus for a little bit?
-I'm in.

11:13.840 --> 11:16.718
No, his boat.
He can take us to the Santa Schooner.

11:16.801 --> 11:19.054
-Follow my lead.
-(groans)

11:19.137 --> 11:21.681
Mom, we're exhausted.
We need a break.

11:21.765 --> 11:23.767
And a foot rub,
but we'll get to that later.

11:23.850 --> 11:26.311
Oh, uh, Bob,
can we manage without the kids?

11:26.394 --> 11:27.979
Wait, I could run another bungee cord

11:28.063 --> 11:29.356
under my crotch.

11:29.439 --> 11:31.232
Oh, yeah, you've got this.

11:31.316 --> 11:33.985
Fine. If you see the mayor,
tell him about our mayor special.

11:34.069 --> 11:36.029
Is it smothered in mayor-naise?

11:36.112 --> 11:37.530
Now it is.

11:37.614 --> 11:39.199
I'm gonna tell the mayor
I thought of that.

11:39.282 --> 11:42.243
-Gus, buddy!
-Children.

11:42.327 --> 11:43.828
Looks like someone's got a date

11:43.912 --> 11:45.830
with that salty lass, the sea.

11:45.914 --> 11:48.291
Oh, yup, going home, to the ocean.

11:48.375 --> 11:50.335
Just kidding.
I live in a house.

11:50.418 --> 11:52.754
Wait, we need
to get out to that yacht over there.

11:52.837 --> 11:56.049
The one with Santa barfing off the side?

11:56.132 --> 11:58.051
That's the one.
We need to, uh...

11:58.134 --> 11:59.969
get barf medicine to him.

12:00.053 --> 12:02.055
We're doctors.
Damn good ones.

12:02.138 --> 12:04.391
-Nope. Nope, we're not.
-She's not, we are.

12:04.474 --> 12:06.601
Hey, I know what this is.

12:06.685 --> 12:08.520
You kids want to go on that Santa Schooner

12:08.603 --> 12:09.646
and get the pick of the litter.

12:09.729 --> 12:11.064
-What?! No.
-Exactly.

12:11.147 --> 12:13.608
It's okay, I get it.
I always kind of wanted

12:13.692 --> 12:15.068
to take down Santa.

12:15.151 --> 12:17.654
It's the ultimate heist.
Hop in.

12:17.737 --> 12:19.948
-(groans)
-Untie that, will you?

12:20.031 --> 12:21.866
Oh, wait, not that one.
Oh, God.

12:21.950 --> 12:24.577
Uh, let's go, let's go!

12:25.578 --> 12:28.456
Bob, parade's almost over
and what do you know,

12:28.540 --> 12:30.333
no one's tried to pants you.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.961
-Huh, I mean, that's true.
-PRESIDENT: Testing, testing.

12:33.044 --> 12:34.671
I love to yacht, I live to yacht.

12:34.754 --> 12:36.047
My yacht is hot, I yacht a lot.

12:36.131 --> 12:37.215
Sound okay?

12:37.298 --> 12:38.967
Thank you, everyone for coming

12:39.050 --> 12:40.927
to the Yacht-mas Yacht Parade.

12:41.011 --> 12:42.929
Tonight we give members of the community

12:43.013 --> 12:44.556
a chance to get to know us.

12:44.639 --> 12:47.392
We're more than just tan,
happy faces on a yacht

12:47.475 --> 12:49.269
sailing past you.

12:49.352 --> 12:52.689
We're your bosses and neighbors,
depending on where you live.

12:52.772 --> 12:56.609
And to show our appreciation for you,
our neighbors,

12:56.693 --> 12:58.236
let's have our community food vendors

12:58.319 --> 12:59.946
come up here on stage.

13:00.030 --> 13:03.199
-Of course. It's happening now.
-Wha?

13:03.283 --> 13:04.993
Excuse me, sir, can you follow me?

13:05.076 --> 13:06.870
This is it, Linda.
I can feel it.

13:06.953 --> 13:09.080
Oh, you and Jimmy
and your stupid penis fights.

13:09.164 --> 13:12.292
I wish you could both just...
(gasps) The mayor! There he is!

13:12.375 --> 13:14.627
Sir, is there a reason
you're not coming with me?

13:14.711 --> 13:16.338
Bob, you're gonna
be so close to the mayor.

13:16.421 --> 13:17.964
Give him this.
Oh, and ask him if he'd

13:18.048 --> 13:20.008
want to start a podcast with a sassy mom.

13:20.091 --> 13:21.968
Uh, and it's called
<i>The Mayor Show with Mayor and Linda.</i>

13:22.052 --> 13:25.555
All right, Jimmy, let's pants.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.057
GENE:
How does this work, Gus?

13:27.140 --> 13:29.059
Do you just toss us into the yacht?

13:29.142 --> 13:31.269
Pirates use poles
to attach ropes to the side.

13:31.353 --> 13:33.688
-Where do you keep your pirate poles, Gus?
-There's a ladder.

13:33.772 --> 13:36.191
Uh, never mind, there's no ladder.
Let's go back.

13:36.274 --> 13:38.401
-No, I see it. That's a ladder.
-Aha!

13:38.485 --> 13:40.695
-Come on.
-O-Okay, I'll wait here

13:40.779 --> 13:43.406
and hold this thing
that you said wasn't a ladder.

13:43.490 --> 13:46.993
Say "Cayman Islands."

13:47.077 --> 13:48.787
-Uh-uh-uh. Stay back, Jimmy.
-Huh?

13:48.870 --> 13:50.038
When's it gonna happen?

13:50.121 --> 13:51.790
What?
Don't worry about it.

13:51.873 --> 13:53.958
(loud whisper):
Bob. Bob. Mayor.

13:54.042 --> 13:56.127
-I know.
-Burger.

13:56.211 --> 13:57.712
I'll give it to him, Linda.

13:57.796 --> 13:59.964
Don't yell at me.
And smile.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.134
-BOB: Trev, Trev, Trev.
-(President speaks indistinctly)

14:03.218 --> 14:04.844
I see you.

14:04.928 --> 14:06.554
Oh, wait, he just
walked behind someone tall.

14:06.638 --> 14:09.057
Now I see you again.

14:12.143 --> 14:14.979
Okay, they're already wrapped,
so we're gonna have to shake 'em

14:15.063 --> 14:16.606
to find the good stuff.

14:16.690 --> 14:18.358
And if one sounds like
it's got a dangerous,

14:18.441 --> 14:20.402
tiny car inside, send it my way.

14:20.485 --> 14:22.028
What if Teddy sees us?
He already said

14:22.112 --> 14:23.488
we can't have presents
before the other kids.

14:23.571 --> 14:26.199
-Teddy's not gonna see us.
-Oh, hey, kids.

14:26.282 --> 14:28.660
Teddy, buddy, pal!
What are you doing here?

14:28.743 --> 14:30.161
What?
This isn't our boat.

14:30.245 --> 14:32.163
Teddy, any chance you didn’t see us?

14:35.583 --> 14:37.085
Don't even think about it, Trev!

14:37.168 --> 14:38.878
-Wha?
-What the hell?

14:38.962 --> 14:40.839
Don't you tell Trev not to think about it.

14:40.922 --> 14:42.424
Think about it, Trev.

14:42.507 --> 14:44.259
I know what you're up to.

14:44.342 --> 14:45.260
Just chill out, huh?

14:45.343 --> 14:48.096
Don't touch me!
Aah!

14:50.557 --> 14:52.058
Stop it! Stop it!

14:52.142 --> 14:54.436
This is a yacht club, not a golf course.

14:54.519 --> 14:56.354
What's your problem, Bob?

14:56.438 --> 14:58.523
As if you don't know, Jimmy.

14:58.606 --> 15:00.650
Oh, Bob, no!
Wait, the mayor's burger.

15:00.734 --> 15:01.818
Where's the burger?

15:03.653 --> 15:05.071
LINDA:
Bobby, no!

15:05.155 --> 15:08.658
Oh, God, there's bungee cords everywhere.

15:10.744 --> 15:14.748
-Bobby! -Cold. So cold.
-Stupid Bob. Stupid water.

15:14.831 --> 15:17.167
You two, get them out!
This is what happens

15:17.250 --> 15:19.210
when you open your doors to the boatless.

15:19.294 --> 15:22.881
I mean, uh, who's psyched for Santa?

15:22.964 --> 15:25.550
Eesh.
You kids were gonna take the gifts?

15:25.633 --> 15:27.469
That's not so nice.

15:27.552 --> 15:29.929
Look, if we could have
waited in that line, we would have.

15:30.013 --> 15:31.931
But we've been busy
doing hard burger labor

15:32.015 --> 15:33.391
with our numb little hands.

15:33.475 --> 15:34.934
What are those kids doing?

15:35.018 --> 15:36.686
They're just standing there
waiting to stuff

15:36.770 --> 15:38.396
their big old present pockets,

15:38.480 --> 15:40.774
which I assume they have.
Must be nice!

15:40.857 --> 15:43.568
Uh, okay,
if you really think it's the right thing

15:43.651 --> 15:46.279
for you to get gifts
ahead of the other kids,

15:46.363 --> 15:47.280
I'll give you gifts.

15:47.364 --> 15:48.865
Then it's up to us?

15:48.948 --> 15:50.408
-Uh, I guess.
-Great.

15:50.492 --> 15:52.369
-So we don't want gifts.
-We want the gifts.

15:52.452 --> 15:53.870
And we feel really good about it.

15:55.455 --> 15:57.540
<i>PRESIDENT:</i>
<i>Inside the clubhouse</i>

15:57.624 --> 15:59.459
is supposed to be for members only,

15:59.542 --> 16:02.045
but we're always happy to accommodate two

16:02.128 --> 16:04.506
shivering naked people
who fell in the ocean.

16:04.589 --> 16:06.341
Sorry to be naked.

16:06.424 --> 16:09.177
Uh, they made us
take off our wet clothes so, you know,

16:09.260 --> 16:10.345
we wouldn't die.

16:10.428 --> 16:12.263
Well, I hope it was worth it.

16:12.347 --> 16:15.558
Hey, I'm, uh, basically
a member now, right? Damn it.

16:15.642 --> 16:17.894
-Thanks a lot, Bob.
-It's your fault, Jimmy.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.605
-It was your dumb plan.
-What plan?

16:20.689 --> 16:23.274
Your plan to pants me
in front of everybody.

16:23.358 --> 16:25.819
I wasn't gonna pants you, idiot.

16:25.902 --> 16:28.154
-But what about what Trev said?
-What? (stammers)

16:28.238 --> 16:31.241
-Trev was supposed to shout something
from the audience.
-Shout what?

16:31.324 --> 16:34.077
Well, something about me
and how I helped with all this.

16:34.160 --> 16:37.205
He was gonna get the whole crowd
to chant "Jimmy, Jimmy"

16:37.288 --> 16:38.957
so the guy would hear and, uh, you know,

16:39.040 --> 16:40.750
I'd get in this damn club.

16:40.834 --> 16:43.545
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I-I don't get it.

16:43.628 --> 16:45.672
You recommended me for this.
Why?

16:45.755 --> 16:47.924
You-you had to be
setting me up for something.

16:48.008 --> 16:50.010
(mutters quietly): I thought
the yacht guys would like your food.

16:50.093 --> 16:51.511
What?
I couldn't hear you.

16:51.594 --> 16:53.722
I said...
(mumbles indistinctly)

16:53.805 --> 16:55.348
No, now you just mumbled.

16:55.432 --> 16:56.725
You're covering your face
with your blanket.

16:56.808 --> 16:58.476
I thought they would like your food,

16:58.560 --> 17:00.395
and then they would like me
because I recommended you

17:00.478 --> 17:01.896
and that's how I'd get into the thing.

17:01.980 --> 17:04.065
You thought they would like my food?

17:04.149 --> 17:06.651
Oh, it sounds gross when you say it.

17:06.735 --> 17:07.902
We need you to leave.

17:07.986 --> 17:09.446
Here are some blazers we keep

17:09.529 --> 17:11.322
in case people forget to wear blazers.

17:11.406 --> 17:14.826
And pants in case people
forget to wear pants. Thank you.

17:14.909 --> 17:16.745
Mission accomplished, huh, guys?

17:16.828 --> 17:18.955
-Nice work.
-Wow, look at the present line.

17:19.039 --> 17:20.832
GENE:
It got really long.

17:20.915 --> 17:22.751
You know, some kids
like just waiting in line.

17:22.834 --> 17:24.753
They make friends, share stories.

17:24.836 --> 17:26.463
It's the journey, you know.

17:26.546 --> 17:28.923
And we're moving closer,
and I'm getting a good look

17:29.007 --> 17:31.593
at these kids now,
seeing some excited faces,

17:31.676 --> 17:33.261
some Christmas joy.

17:33.345 --> 17:34.929
Feeling some guilt, some regrets.

17:35.013 --> 17:37.015
Gonna close my eyes.
Don't like it.

17:37.098 --> 17:39.225
Me, too.
Oh, God, I still see their faces!

17:39.309 --> 17:40.435
Wait, I didn't close my eyes.

17:40.518 --> 17:42.562
(sighs): They deserve these gifts

17:42.645 --> 17:44.189
more than we do, don't they?

17:44.272 --> 17:45.857
Kind off what
I've been saying for a while.

17:45.940 --> 17:47.567
Well, you didn't say it
good enough, did you?

17:47.650 --> 17:50.653
-Uh-huh. Sure, sure.
-Ugh, let's give back the gifts.

17:50.737 --> 17:52.697
Or you can give 'em to your old friend Gus

17:52.781 --> 17:55.283
and see what he can get for them on eBay.

17:55.367 --> 17:58.453
Ho, ho, ho!
Happy holidays, son.

17:58.536 --> 18:00.705
Sorry I said son.
That sounds weird.

18:00.789 --> 18:02.332
Uncle Father Santa Teddy?

18:02.415 --> 18:04.042
Hey, kids.
I'm a little busy.

18:04.125 --> 18:07.045
We're giving our gifts back
for you to give to them.

18:07.128 --> 18:08.380
Oh, you sure?

18:08.463 --> 18:10.632
-Yeah, we're sure.
-Okay, good for you.

18:10.715 --> 18:12.050
Hey, can you do me a favor?

18:12.133 --> 18:15.136
Great, more selfless acts.
How can we be of service?

18:15.220 --> 18:18.306
Could you grab my backup beard?
It's in my bag in the yacht.

18:18.390 --> 18:20.308
Did you forgot to take off your beard
when you barfed?

18:20.392 --> 18:23.311
-Can you tell?
-No, it smells great.

18:23.395 --> 18:26.731
Well, we went from holding
three sweet gifts in our hands

18:26.815 --> 18:28.858
to looking for a less-barfy beard.

18:28.942 --> 18:30.402
I think this is Teddy's bag.

18:30.485 --> 18:31.611
Wait, there's a note for us.

18:31.695 --> 18:32.904
"I knew you kids would do the right thing.

18:32.987 --> 18:34.906
"Here's an RC car that goes too fast.

18:34.989 --> 18:36.074
We can't give it out.

18:36.157 --> 18:37.784
"The battery gets very, very hot,

18:37.867 --> 18:40.745
"like about to catch on fire,
so, you know, look out for that.

18:40.829 --> 18:43.498
Merry Christmas,
Uncle Father Santa Teddy."

18:43.581 --> 18:46.376
That thoughtful son of a gun.
I get it first.

18:46.459 --> 18:49.295
You did it, Teddy.
You're a good Santa.

18:49.379 --> 18:51.256
-A real good Santa.
-Santa, hurry up.

18:51.339 --> 18:52.424
-(kids shouting indistinctly)
-Ow, ow!

18:52.507 --> 18:54.259
Can-can I get some help, please?
Elves!

18:55.760 --> 18:58.763
This thing is amazing!
Pick up your feet!

18:58.847 --> 19:00.432
Okay, be careful.
Rich people's toes

19:00.515 --> 19:02.100
are worth two of our toes.

19:02.183 --> 19:04.102
How you feeling, Bob, you pruney loony?

19:04.185 --> 19:06.271
I'm okay.
The yacht club clothes are nice.

19:06.354 --> 19:08.064
They fit better than my regular clothes.

19:08.148 --> 19:09.983
Yeah.
Who knew clothes could fit?

19:10.066 --> 19:13.153
Hey, um, sorry I didn't
listen to you about Jimmy.

19:13.236 --> 19:15.155
It's okay.
As long as you admit

19:15.238 --> 19:16.823
we got this gig because we deserve it.

19:16.906 --> 19:18.742
-Hmm, maybe.
-And 'cause we work hard.

19:18.825 --> 19:20.368
And 'cause you got a hot butt.

19:20.452 --> 19:22.037
I can see it now that your pants fit.
Whoa!

19:22.120 --> 19:23.455
Move over, J.Lo.

19:23.538 --> 19:24.914
I can't believe Jimmy was actually

19:24.998 --> 19:26.374
doing something nice for me.

19:26.458 --> 19:28.418
I-I kind of feel bad for him.

19:28.501 --> 19:30.628
Uh, yeah, my yacht's over there.
Did you see it?

19:30.712 --> 19:32.339
Oh, sorry, y-you were talking.

19:32.422 --> 19:36.092
-Yeah, poor, dumb Jimmy.
-(sighs) I'll be right back.

19:36.176 --> 19:39.512
-Um, excuse me.
-Hmm. You continue to be here.

19:39.596 --> 19:41.806
Yeah.
Uh, sorry about everything.

19:41.890 --> 19:43.725
I-I just wanted to say I think you should

19:43.808 --> 19:45.268
still let Jimmy join the club.

19:45.352 --> 19:47.812
(chuckling):
Oh, I don't think that will be happening.

19:47.896 --> 19:49.606
But tonight wasn't a total disaster.

19:49.689 --> 19:51.274
People raved about your burgers.

19:51.358 --> 19:55.028
Really?
Uh, well, then I-I guess I should tell you

19:55.111 --> 19:57.864
all the credit belongs to Jimmy?

19:57.947 --> 19:59.532
-Was that a question?
-No.

19:59.616 --> 20:02.369
-Jimmy taught me so much.
-Him?

20:02.452 --> 20:05.246
I-It's true.
He's my, uh, ugh,

20:05.330 --> 20:07.374
mentor of food.

20:07.457 --> 20:10.794
And he's such a great guy.

20:10.877 --> 20:12.879
Goodbye.

20:12.962 --> 20:15.674
-Well, I did what I could.
-What'd you say?

20:15.757 --> 20:18.134
I-I really don't want to talk about it.
I feel dirty.

20:18.218 --> 20:19.719
I might jump in the water again.

20:19.803 --> 20:22.472
Mm, excuse me.
Bob and Linda Belcher?

20:22.555 --> 20:23.890
Uh, yeah, that's us.

20:23.973 --> 20:25.892
-I work for the mayor.
-(gasps)

20:25.975 --> 20:28.395
He sent me to compliment you
on the delicious burger

20:28.478 --> 20:29.979
he tried earlier this evening.

20:30.063 --> 20:31.272
Wait, how'd he get a burger?

20:31.356 --> 20:33.650
Uh, yeah, we made one for him
but I dropped it.

20:33.733 --> 20:34.943
Yes, it landed on the ground,

20:35.026 --> 20:37.112
and the mayor
followed the three-second rule.

20:37.195 --> 20:38.863
He had worked up quite an appetite

20:38.947 --> 20:40.740
from greeting people and watching yachts.

20:40.824 --> 20:42.742
Oh, my God!
Kids, come here.

20:42.826 --> 20:44.536
This man says the mayor tried our burger

20:44.619 --> 20:45.745
and he loved it.
He loved it.

20:45.829 --> 20:47.706
Yeah, he ate it off the ground.

20:47.789 --> 20:50.625
-Eh, our dad's food's
better off the ground.
-Floors work, too.

20:50.709 --> 20:52.961
Ah, what a Christmas.
Bob, make some fries.

20:53.044 --> 20:56.214
-I'm gonna dump 'em on the dock
and see if he comes back.
-Uh, yep.

20:56.297 --> 20:58.383
Ho, ho, ho!
Who wants erasers?

20:58.466 --> 21:00.844
Hey, you got the car out.
Ow, my toe!

21:22.615 --> 21:23.867
Uh, pass.

21:23.950 --> 21:25.660
Well, your stomach shook like jelly.

21:25.744 --> 21:27.954
-Okay.
-But your beard was kind of smelly.

21:28.038 --> 21:31.958
-Oh.
