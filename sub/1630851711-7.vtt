WEBVTT

00:07.551 --> 00:08.896
This is Rodrigo Canales,

00:08.896 --> 00:11.137
the hottest music-video director
in the game.

00:11.137 --> 00:12.310
Yes, Naomi!

00:12.310 --> 00:13.482
You are the queen!

00:13.482 --> 00:15.931
The last couple of months
have been...rough.

00:15.931 --> 00:18.206
We'll get through it --
I promise.

00:18.206 --> 00:20.103
My mother
showing back up in my life

00:20.103 --> 00:22.310
is the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

00:22.310 --> 00:25.103
We caught your mom taking
pictures of your credit cards.

00:25.103 --> 00:26.482
I got dropped
by my label.

00:26.482 --> 00:29.448
I owe them $750,000.

00:29.448 --> 00:30.448
And I'm homeless.

00:30.448 --> 00:31.758
I fixed it
with the label.

00:31.758 --> 00:33.068
I paid off the debt.
We cool.

00:33.068 --> 00:34.068
You can crash with me

00:34.068 --> 00:35.137
until we figure
something out.

00:35.137 --> 00:36.586
If I knew I'd get
this much attention,

00:36.586 --> 00:38.172
I would have said I was gay
ages ago.

00:38.172 --> 00:39.344
You getting
back together?

00:39.344 --> 00:40.965
It's like
we never broke up.

00:40.965 --> 00:42.793
Tina, I'm sorry you got
the wrong impression,

00:42.793 --> 00:43.965
but --
You used me.

00:43.965 --> 00:45.241
You're disgusting.

00:45.241 --> 00:47.344
So a mom,
a washed-up musician,

00:47.344 --> 00:49.965
a disgraced daytime TV host,
a lesbian church lady,

00:49.965 --> 00:52.241
and a young rapper
fresh out of rehab

00:52.241 --> 00:53.413
are going on a world tour?

00:56.655 --> 00:57.793
Brianna:
I've forgiven Jeff.

00:57.793 --> 01:00.103
He cheated,
but I'm letting it go.

01:00.103 --> 01:01.724
I'm at peace.

01:28.793 --> 01:29.896
It's dope, right?

01:29.896 --> 01:31.517
Yeah.

01:31.517 --> 01:33.172
What happened to your face?
I'm good.

01:33.172 --> 01:34.724
Bruh, what happened?

01:34.724 --> 01:36.965
This is about you guys.
Your future. Redemption.

01:36.965 --> 01:38.103
Okay, hey, listen...

01:38.103 --> 01:39.344
- Oh, my God.

01:39.344 --> 01:40.655
Oh! Oh, my God!

01:40.655 --> 01:41.655
- Oh, my God!
- You don't want to do this!

01:41.655 --> 01:43.827
Listen,
I'll get you your money.

01:46.724 --> 01:49.206
Man:
<i>Ladies and gentlemen...</i>

01:49.206 --> 01:52.275
<i>all rise for the Queens!</i>

01:52.275 --> 01:54.241
Look at me.

01:54.241 --> 01:55.655
Fierce.

01:55.655 --> 01:57.517
Oh, give it!

01:57.517 --> 01:59.034
Nicely done, Valeria.

01:59.034 --> 02:01.689
I used to be the spokeswoman
for Herbal Essences.

02:01.689 --> 02:04.655
The moans were
<i>totally</i> my idea.

02:06.275 --> 02:08.965
Just think, number-one song,
hot video,

02:08.965 --> 02:10.482
and now a world tour.

02:10.482 --> 02:11.620
We're back.

02:11.620 --> 02:12.965
Can I get Lil Muffin?

02:12.965 --> 02:14.034
Konichiwa, Lil Babies.

02:14.034 --> 02:15.931
Girl, if you
don't get over here...

02:18.689 --> 02:19.931
Photographer:
Keep that energy up, ladies.

02:19.931 --> 02:21.965
These photos are gonna be seen
around the world.

02:21.965 --> 02:23.724
If you think Jones Beach
is gonna cut it

02:23.724 --> 02:26.034
for their New York homecoming,
you're buggin'.

02:26.034 --> 02:27.758
We need The Garden.

02:28.862 --> 02:30.034
Hold on.

02:36.206 --> 02:37.689
Yo, sorry.
I'm still here.

02:38.965 --> 02:40.689
You good?
Yeah.

02:40.689 --> 02:42.724
I'm broke and crashing
at E-Roc's.

02:42.724 --> 02:45.620
Label took
my samurai swords --

02:45.620 --> 02:47.068
everything
but the iguanas.

02:47.068 --> 02:49.724
Well, the tour will get you
back on track financially.

02:49.724 --> 02:51.758
Yeah, well,
Eric went whisper,

02:51.758 --> 02:53.413
whisper like he do
in the label's ear,

02:53.413 --> 02:57.344
and the punks forgave
the $750,000 I "owed" them.

02:57.344 --> 02:58.551
It ain't about the bread,
though.

02:58.551 --> 03:00.793
Pocket's light,
but now I'm Morgan Freeman.

03:00.793 --> 03:02.103
What?
Free.

03:02.103 --> 03:04.482
Da Bakery gone.
I don't have a label anymore.

03:04.482 --> 03:07.655
But that mean
I don't have bosses.

03:07.655 --> 03:09.965
But I got da Queens.

03:09.965 --> 03:12.137
What's it like being boo'd up
with Tina again?

03:12.137 --> 03:13.379
We're not together.

03:13.379 --> 03:14.448
Oh.

03:15.344 --> 03:16.517
Yeah.

03:16.517 --> 03:18.689
Well, I guess we both
Morgan Freeman.

03:18.689 --> 03:21.758
That's it.
Billboard in every city.

03:21.758 --> 03:23.172
Yeah, I want the one
in front of Staples Center

03:23.172 --> 03:25.241
up tonight, though.

03:25.241 --> 03:26.275
A'ight.

03:39.310 --> 03:41.724
I don't know how you haven't
confronted her about this yet.

03:41.724 --> 03:44.103
Your mom, who shows up
after 30 years,

03:44.103 --> 03:46.241
gets caught taking pictures
of your credit cards?

03:46.241 --> 03:48.000
I'm keeping a close eye
on the account.

03:48.000 --> 03:49.448
There haven't been
any charges.

03:49.448 --> 03:52.758
I left out my jewelry,
my Birkins -- nothing.

03:52.758 --> 03:54.655
I'm sure there's
an innocent explanation.

03:54.655 --> 03:57.068
Mm-hmm. That, apparently, you're
not interested in hearing.

03:57.068 --> 03:58.862
Old Valeria is cynical.

03:58.862 --> 04:01.172
She assumes the worst.

04:01.172 --> 04:02.689
I don't want to be her.

04:04.310 --> 04:06.689
Man:
They're just five minutes out.
They're in touch-up, so...

04:06.689 --> 04:08.241
Yeah.

04:09.689 --> 04:11.965
Yes! Mm!

04:16.034 --> 04:18.172
Yes!
That's the billboard.

04:19.275 --> 04:21.068
Can you believe this?
Honestly?

04:21.068 --> 04:24.103
That troll doll --
mad respect --

04:24.103 --> 04:26.103
samples our song,
and now we're about to

04:26.103 --> 04:28.448
go on a world tour
20 years after we broke up.

04:28.448 --> 04:32.172
This all feels right, though.
Like it had to happen this way.

04:32.172 --> 04:34.034
Bree, we have
everything we want.

04:34.034 --> 04:36.551
Mm-hmm.
Yo, where did Jill
sneak off to?

04:36.551 --> 04:37.655
I don't know.

04:37.655 --> 04:40.931
Alright.
Those photos looking <i>fly.</i>

04:40.931 --> 04:43.241
So next up, we got the press
conference to announce the tour

04:43.241 --> 04:44.379
at 4:00 p.m. today.

04:44.379 --> 04:46.896
Make sure Jill
shows up on time since...

04:46.896 --> 04:48.206
Are you good?

04:48.206 --> 04:49.724
Yeah, why?

04:49.724 --> 04:51.793
I mean, you -- you smiling.
Well, it's a photo shoot.

04:51.793 --> 04:54.068
I was told that smiling
was obligatory.

04:54.068 --> 04:57.068
Okay.

04:57.068 --> 05:00.172
So who is this mystery texter
that has you mad giddy?

05:00.172 --> 05:01.275
Nobody.

05:01.275 --> 05:03.482
"Nobody" as in
Rodrigo's fine ass?

05:03.482 --> 05:05.724
It's okay.

05:05.724 --> 05:07.724
It's good to see you smile.

05:07.724 --> 05:10.068
Weird and completely
out of character,

05:10.068 --> 05:11.172
but it's good.

05:11.172 --> 05:12.931
It's <i>fun</i> to flirt.

05:12.931 --> 05:13.965
I mean, he's funny.

05:13.965 --> 05:16.620
He knows music,
and he loves my music.

05:16.620 --> 05:20.172
Umm, then homeboy is <i>definitely</i>
<i>speaking your love language.</i>

05:20.172 --> 05:21.827
But I just agreed
to a date.

05:21.827 --> 05:24.068
But that's how these things
usually happen.

05:24.068 --> 05:25.241
We're going on tour.

05:25.241 --> 05:26.724
I mean, what's the point
of starting something now?

05:26.724 --> 05:30.034
Mm. This is you trying to find
a problem, like old Valeria.

05:30.034 --> 05:31.965
It's my first date.

05:31.965 --> 05:33.655
In a while.
I get that.

05:33.655 --> 05:35.655
No, like in --
like, ever.

05:36.620 --> 05:38.103
Don't look at me
like that.

05:39.172 --> 05:41.103
Look, I had whatever I had
with Eric.

05:41.103 --> 05:42.241
You know,
that wasn't normal.

05:42.241 --> 05:43.965
Then I had a kid at 21,

05:43.965 --> 05:46.620
and I've basically been living
on the road since I was 18.

05:46.620 --> 05:48.103
That's not normal.

05:48.103 --> 05:51.000
Rodrigo seems normal.

05:51.000 --> 05:52.724
And nice, and into you,

05:52.724 --> 05:55.172
and wants to take you
on a date.

05:55.172 --> 05:56.724
Then I don't know normal.

05:56.724 --> 05:58.586
I'm not letting you
sabotage this date.

05:58.586 --> 06:00.517
What is it Rodrigo said
at the video shoot?

06:00.517 --> 06:03.620
The first step to feeling good
is looking good.

06:06.758 --> 06:10.620
We're looking for
something sexy.

06:10.620 --> 06:12.517
Who says I need a dress
to be sexy?

06:12.517 --> 06:14.517
Fine.
Probably for the best.

06:14.517 --> 06:17.310
You know, I wore a dress
on my first date with Jeff,

06:17.310 --> 06:18.448
and in the middle of dinner,

06:18.448 --> 06:20.137
he leans across the table
to try to kiss me,

06:20.137 --> 06:22.068
and dude spills
an entire glass of wine

06:22.068 --> 06:23.241
down the front of my dress.

06:23.241 --> 06:25.862
Then he sprints out
of the restaurant,

06:25.862 --> 06:28.172
and I thought he bailed,
but 10 minutes later,

06:28.172 --> 06:30.379
he came back with a sweatshirt
that said "I Love LA"

06:30.379 --> 06:31.655
for me to change into.
Mm.

06:31.655 --> 06:33.137
And you married him
anyway.

06:33.137 --> 06:34.620
Uh, it was memorable.

06:35.655 --> 06:38.620
That was Jeff --
messy but memorable.

06:38.620 --> 06:41.310
How could you not tell me
that you and Eric...

06:42.344 --> 06:43.758
...had a thing
back in the day?

06:43.758 --> 06:45.068
You just
gagged

06:45.068 --> 06:47.000
in the middle
of asking the question.

06:47.000 --> 06:49.068
What about now?

06:49.068 --> 06:50.517
Do you think you'd ever
get back together?

06:50.517 --> 06:52.965
I thought you was all gung-ho
on me dating Rodrigo.

06:52.965 --> 06:55.655
I mean, I am,
but it's just that

06:55.655 --> 06:57.862
you've been raising Jojo
all alone.

06:57.862 --> 07:00.793
And I don't know --
you could maybe have a family.

07:00.793 --> 07:02.379
Girl, one thing at a time.

07:02.379 --> 07:05.517
Date.
I agreed to a date.
Ooh.

07:05.517 --> 07:07.551
This one's perfect
for you.
Ooh.

07:07.551 --> 07:10.068
And I'm gonna rock
this one.

07:10.068 --> 07:11.275
Yes, bitch.

07:11.275 --> 07:13.689
Your grown, no-date-having ass
needs a chaperone.

07:16.068 --> 07:17.137
What's that?

07:17.137 --> 07:18.517
She got a date,

07:18.517 --> 07:20.758
and this is where you smile
and act like

07:20.758 --> 07:22.551
you ain't
peanut butter and jelly.

07:22.551 --> 07:24.448
Jealous?

07:24.448 --> 07:26.103
It's good.

07:26.103 --> 07:28.103
I'm glad.

07:28.103 --> 07:29.344
Peanut butter
and jelly.

07:41.206 --> 07:44.000
- This is embarrassing.
- Which part?

07:44.000 --> 07:46.172
The part where you think
I'm trying to steal from you.

07:46.172 --> 07:49.551
Why else would you be taking
pictures of my credit cards?

07:49.551 --> 07:52.068
Well, I guess that's
embarrassing, too.

07:52.068 --> 07:54.172
I was in your trailer
during the video shoot.

07:54.172 --> 07:56.137
Your purse fell,
I was picking up all the stuff,

07:56.137 --> 07:58.517
and your wallet was open,
and I-I saw this.

07:58.517 --> 07:59.965
You have to understand,

07:59.965 --> 08:03.724
I am on the set of
my daughter's music video,

08:03.724 --> 08:06.620
staring at
an Amex Black Card.

08:06.620 --> 08:09.068
I didn't even think
they were real.

08:09.068 --> 08:10.586
I was proud.

08:12.655 --> 08:14.517
I took a picture of it.

08:16.172 --> 08:17.689
I know how it looks.

08:17.689 --> 08:20.517
It was <i>stupid.</i>

08:20.517 --> 08:24.344
But I was just proud.
That's it.

08:31.965 --> 08:34.827
It's hard for me
to trust people.

08:34.827 --> 08:37.241
It's okay.
I need to earn it.

08:37.241 --> 08:39.965
I need to be your mother
and show you

08:39.965 --> 08:42.206
that's the only reason
I'm here.

08:42.206 --> 08:44.413
And I will. I swear.

08:46.586 --> 08:48.310
So Rosie's prints
are definitely on it?

08:48.310 --> 08:50.482
Made sure of it.
You have a guy, right?

08:50.482 --> 08:51.793
Old security is a PI.

08:51.793 --> 08:53.931
I used him to find out
who sold those nudes of you

08:53.931 --> 08:56.068
to the <i>Enquirer.</i>
<i>Right. He was good.</i>

08:56.068 --> 08:58.344
A lot of time and bread
only to find out it was you.

08:58.344 --> 08:59.620
Yeah. He's good.

09:02.896 --> 09:05.965
I just need to know
if she's as good as she seems.

09:05.965 --> 09:07.344
I hope she is.

09:07.344 --> 09:08.965
'Cause you deserve it.

09:45.241 --> 09:46.482
Yo.

09:46.482 --> 09:48.689
I was expecting
something special,

09:48.689 --> 09:50.172
but, damn, you killed it.

09:50.172 --> 09:51.758
Thank you so much.

09:51.758 --> 09:54.172
I'm just honored that
you asked me to do this.

09:54.172 --> 09:55.310
Are you kidding me?

09:55.310 --> 09:57.827
After I saw you
on the BET Awards --

09:57.827 --> 09:59.827
your bravery,
your talent --

09:59.827 --> 10:01.965
I knew I had to
lock into your energy.

10:01.965 --> 10:03.931
So, I gotta ask you
something, though --

10:03.931 --> 10:05.310
artist to artist --

10:05.310 --> 10:07.068
what do you think
of the track?

10:08.689 --> 10:10.724
Uh, it's fantastic.

10:10.724 --> 10:12.517
Really. I-I love it.

10:12.517 --> 10:14.379
I hear you,
but your face is saying

10:14.379 --> 10:15.379
something
totally different.

10:15.379 --> 10:17.137
Talk to me.

10:17.137 --> 10:19.896
Alright.
I do think that your vocals

10:19.896 --> 10:21.724
could have a little more depth
in the hook.

10:21.724 --> 10:25.172
I'd add another layer,
maybe pitch down an octave.

10:26.379 --> 10:28.206
Okay.

10:28.206 --> 10:30.517
Or
you can just ignore

10:30.517 --> 10:31.793
everything I just said.

10:31.793 --> 10:33.413
No, no, no.
Not at all.

10:33.413 --> 10:36.172
Honestly, it did sound
a little bit flat.

10:37.620 --> 10:39.827
You got pipes?
You sing?

10:39.827 --> 10:42.827
Never outside of a church,
but, yeah, I sing.

10:42.827 --> 10:47.379
A rapper, a singer that
got something to say?

10:47.379 --> 10:49.655
Ah, you're a unicorn.

10:49.655 --> 10:51.000
Ah, I don't know
about all of that.

10:52.206 --> 10:55.344
So...
what if I told you,

10:55.344 --> 10:57.482
let's catch a vibe?

10:57.482 --> 11:00.517
Lay some vocals,
put some harmonies,

11:00.517 --> 11:02.517
you sing that hook
up an octave,

11:02.517 --> 11:04.655
put my vocal
up against that.

11:04.655 --> 11:05.689
What do you say?

11:05.689 --> 11:07.655
Really?
Yeah.

11:07.655 --> 11:09.862
You got a place that
you have to be?

11:11.689 --> 11:13.379
No.

11:13.379 --> 11:15.068
No, I'm all yours.
Let's do it.

11:15.068 --> 11:16.793
Let's do it.
Okay, then.

11:16.793 --> 11:17.862
Let's do it.

11:40.689 --> 11:42.551
Hmm.

11:42.551 --> 11:44.068
Okay.

11:44.068 --> 11:45.517
Okay.

11:48.965 --> 11:51.206
Mm-hmm.

11:59.413 --> 12:02.551
You didn't have to bring
these two with you.

12:02.551 --> 12:04.862
Clearly, your phone
ain't working.

12:04.862 --> 12:07.413
I saw your calls.
Been busy.

12:07.413 --> 12:09.965
Well, it's time to
open up your schedule,

12:09.965 --> 12:12.896
ya wallet, and pay back
that cake you owe.

12:12.896 --> 12:14.034
Can you keep it down?

12:14.034 --> 12:15.517
You got a lot of rules
for someone

12:15.517 --> 12:18.310
who owes me 750K.

12:18.310 --> 12:19.724
We made a deal, Jones.

12:19.724 --> 12:21.482
You were thirsty for cash
to pay off

12:21.482 --> 12:23.275
ya little Looney Tunes
rapper's debt.

12:23.275 --> 12:24.206
"Looney Tunes"?

12:24.206 --> 12:25.413
You tell me you're gonna
pay back

12:25.413 --> 12:27.724
the first 100 racks
by the 11th.

12:27.724 --> 12:30.448
It's the 11th.
Where's my money?

12:30.448 --> 12:31.758
The Queens' tour
is about to kick off.

12:31.758 --> 12:34.172
I'm good for it.
Why you stressing?

12:34.172 --> 12:37.137
You don't have it,
is what you're telling me.

12:37.137 --> 12:39.068
I'm telling you I will.

12:39.068 --> 12:40.724
Hip-hop has changed.

12:40.724 --> 12:43.034
People's word meant something
back in the day.

12:43.034 --> 12:45.068
Rap music rose up
out of the streets

12:45.068 --> 12:46.965
where reneging got you shot.

12:46.965 --> 12:49.551
Nowadays,
these beefs ain't even real.

12:49.551 --> 12:52.103
You got fools running around
talking 'bout going to war

12:52.103 --> 12:55.689
in skinny jeans across catwalks
at Paris Fashion Week.

12:55.689 --> 12:57.896
That's not me.
I'm old school.

12:57.896 --> 13:01.275
I don't wear skinny jeans,
I hate fashion shows,

13:01.275 --> 13:03.793
and my word is my word.

13:03.793 --> 13:08.068
Get me my money, or we make this
a flashback to the old days.

13:10.862 --> 13:13.103
You got until tonight.

13:13.103 --> 13:14.896
Peace, Jones.

13:20.241 --> 13:21.862
Mm!

13:24.034 --> 13:26.310
What was that about?

13:26.310 --> 13:27.689
Nothing.
Not nothing.

13:27.689 --> 13:30.000
You borrowed money from those
thugs to pay off my debt?

13:30.000 --> 13:31.965
Don't worry about it.
I'm worried.

13:33.655 --> 13:35.137
Come on.

13:35.137 --> 13:37.137
We gotta get to
the tour announcement.

13:44.620 --> 13:46.896
So Brianna is getting touched up
by Trent, and Jill is...?

13:46.896 --> 13:48.931
Oh. We don't even
need to say it.

13:48.931 --> 13:50.379
She late. Again.

13:50.379 --> 13:51.827
Do you need condoms?

13:51.827 --> 13:54.103
Rodrigo is hot
and looks dangerously fertile.

13:54.103 --> 13:55.793
I don't need
any condoms, yo.

13:55.793 --> 13:57.482
Damn. Too old?

13:57.482 --> 14:00.310
Too "I'm not having sex
with him," okay?

14:00.310 --> 14:01.344
It's a date.

14:01.344 --> 14:02.793
My first one
in, like, ever,

14:02.793 --> 14:04.620
so I'm just going to
try to enjoy myself.

14:04.620 --> 14:06.137
I'm late.

14:06.137 --> 14:08.965
No excuses,
just the truth.

14:08.965 --> 14:10.758
I was recording a song
with Wyclef,

14:10.758 --> 14:12.379
and I don't want to
hide it.

14:12.379 --> 14:15.413
It's one song.
I wanted to do it.

14:15.413 --> 14:18.172
I did it,
but I am committed to us.

14:18.172 --> 14:20.448
I'm committed to
this tour.

14:22.034 --> 14:23.413
I love you guys.

14:27.034 --> 14:28.758
Queens against the world.

14:28.758 --> 14:31.034
Mm-hmm!

14:31.034 --> 14:33.275
Remember,
don't let them divide you.

14:34.413 --> 14:36.310
All:
We're going on a world tour!

14:38.241 --> 14:41.517
Tickets go on sale Friday.
Check our socials for the deets.

14:41.517 --> 14:42.655
Uh, who's got questions?

14:42.655 --> 14:44.379
Jill! Jill! Jill!

14:44.379 --> 14:46.862
You've recently emerged
as the group's breakout star.

14:46.862 --> 14:48.896
How does the new hierarchy feel
the second time around?

14:50.068 --> 14:51.793
Hierarchy?

14:51.793 --> 14:53.413
Yo, the only hierarchy
that matters

14:53.413 --> 14:54.931
is us getting
back to the top

14:54.931 --> 14:57.103
and showing the world
what real hip-hop is all about.

14:57.103 --> 14:58.413
Again, for Jill --

14:58.413 --> 15:00.103
your "This Morning America"
interview with Tina

15:00.103 --> 15:01.206
was a real inspiration.

15:01.206 --> 15:02.482
Will she be joining you
on tour?

15:02.482 --> 15:03.862
I adore Tina.

15:03.862 --> 15:05.965
But she has
her own busy life.

15:05.965 --> 15:07.827
- Jill! Jill! Jill!
- Jill! Jill! Another one! Jill!

15:07.827 --> 15:09.931
Are there any questions
about the tour,

15:09.931 --> 15:11.724
or anyone besides Jill?

15:12.620 --> 15:14.000
Reporter:
This one's for Lil Muffin.

15:14.000 --> 15:16.517
You gave the Queens your stage
at the BET Awards,

15:16.517 --> 15:18.344
and now you're
opening for them.

15:18.344 --> 15:20.965
Um, I'm not sure
that's a question,

15:20.965 --> 15:22.448
but opening --

15:22.448 --> 15:24.206
Uh, co-headlining.

15:24.206 --> 15:27.310
Simply sharing the stage
with these Queens

15:27.310 --> 15:29.103
is a dream come true.

15:29.103 --> 15:30.413
Do better, girl.

15:30.413 --> 15:32.827
We're all a family,
including our honorary Queen,

15:32.827 --> 15:33.896
Lil Muffin.

15:33.896 --> 15:35.965
And shout out to
our manager, E-Roc,

15:35.965 --> 15:38.275
for bringing us together
and always looking out.

15:38.275 --> 15:39.793
When can we expect
a Queens album?

15:39.793 --> 15:41.344
Well, as soon as
we finish the tour,

15:41.344 --> 15:43.310
our plan is to start recording
right away.

15:43.310 --> 15:45.068
If you make it that far,
but what's to stop you

15:45.068 --> 15:47.620
from imploding
like you did in 2001?

15:49.137 --> 15:51.862
L-Look, we've been through
too much.

15:51.862 --> 15:53.241
We didn't know
we needed each other then

15:53.241 --> 15:54.655
like we do now.

15:54.655 --> 15:56.000
These women have
lifted me up

15:56.000 --> 15:57.724
through the toughest moment
of my life --

15:57.724 --> 15:59.344
my husband's death.

15:59.344 --> 16:01.896
In the past six months,
we've been through divorces,

16:01.896 --> 16:06.379
crappy performances, rehab,
and we <i>still</i> found our swag.

16:06.379 --> 16:09.137
We're sitting up here
not as rap stars --

16:09.137 --> 16:10.758
we're representing
every woman out there

16:10.758 --> 16:14.103
that wakes up every day,
puts her feet on the ground,

16:14.103 --> 16:15.241
and gets stuff done,

16:15.241 --> 16:17.137
so we ain't going nowhere,
chick.

16:17.137 --> 16:18.379
We here.

16:20.655 --> 16:22.206
Does that answer
your question?

16:24.413 --> 16:26.655
Nice work!

16:26.655 --> 16:28.517
What's your plan
to get Jada his money?

16:28.517 --> 16:30.034
This is not your problem,
alright?

16:30.034 --> 16:32.172
That man had a gun.

16:32.172 --> 16:33.206
We should ask the girls.

16:33.206 --> 16:34.586
No, no, no.
I can't do that.

16:34.586 --> 16:36.724
I'm still
earning back their trust.

16:36.724 --> 16:37.862
I can help.
No.

16:37.862 --> 16:39.551
I can get the money.

16:39.551 --> 16:41.413
This old, rich codger,
Walter Westcott,

16:41.413 --> 16:42.931
has been in my DMs
since before Jesus,

16:42.931 --> 16:44.310
tryna get me
to do a private show.

16:44.310 --> 16:45.931
We never did privates.
You said they were corny.

16:45.931 --> 16:49.551
They are, but if I can get,
like, $250,000 off of him

16:49.551 --> 16:51.620
for an hour's work,
why not?

16:53.103 --> 16:54.586
I learned in rehab that...

16:54.586 --> 16:58.137
...I have to take responsibility
for my actions.

16:58.137 --> 16:59.862
Eric, I'm helping.

17:02.103 --> 17:03.827
Okay.

17:03.827 --> 17:05.000
But I'm coming.
Mm-hmm.

17:05.000 --> 17:06.241
Alright, not a word
to Naomi and the others.

17:06.241 --> 17:08.000
Mm-hmm.

17:09.758 --> 17:11.275
Okay. What you got?

17:13.241 --> 17:14.620
Okay.

17:15.931 --> 17:17.758
Okay, go on.

17:17.758 --> 17:20.724
So my mom's real name
is Valentina Gorgoza --

17:20.724 --> 17:23.241
not Rosie?

17:23.241 --> 17:24.965
Rap sheet
is thick, too.

17:24.965 --> 17:26.965
She's been in and out of prison
since she was a teenager.

17:26.965 --> 17:30.172
Aggravated assault?
Armed robbery?

17:30.172 --> 17:31.793
14 counts of fraud?

17:31.793 --> 17:33.379
So my mom's
a lying criminal.

17:34.482 --> 17:35.896
What?

17:35.896 --> 17:37.241
She's not your mom.

17:37.241 --> 17:39.103
What?

17:39.103 --> 17:40.275
How do you --

17:40.275 --> 17:42.275
Well, Rosie said she had you
when she was 19.

17:42.275 --> 17:45.344
When this woman was 19,
she was locked up in Maryland.

17:45.344 --> 17:46.793
It's a con.

17:55.758 --> 17:58.517
People tell me I'm cold.

17:58.517 --> 18:01.068
They say I'm conniving,

18:01.068 --> 18:02.689
I'm a bitch,

18:02.689 --> 18:05.862
but nobody
ever asks me why.

18:05.862 --> 18:08.931
This is why.

18:08.931 --> 18:10.758
Every time I let someone in,

18:10.758 --> 18:12.793
they make me look
like a fool.

18:12.793 --> 18:15.482
I take advantage
of people and situations

18:15.482 --> 18:18.379
because those are the only kinds
of relationships I know.

18:18.379 --> 18:20.517
That's not true.

18:20.517 --> 18:22.413
Not about you,
not about other people.

18:22.413 --> 18:24.965
No one gives me anything,

18:24.965 --> 18:27.310
and then they look at me
like I'm crazy

18:27.310 --> 18:29.689
when I take what I want.

18:33.241 --> 18:35.931
Is my actual mom alive?

18:35.931 --> 18:37.482
I mean, my guy didn't go
all the way there,

18:37.482 --> 18:39.241
but he could find out.

18:39.241 --> 18:40.827
She knows.

18:40.827 --> 18:42.172
Rosie.

18:42.172 --> 18:44.517
Valentina.

18:44.517 --> 18:47.172
She knows.

18:49.000 --> 18:50.310
Whoa, wait,
where you going?

18:50.310 --> 18:52.793
To kick that lying-ass ho
out of my house.

18:52.793 --> 18:53.827
No.

18:53.827 --> 18:54.862
Let me go.

18:54.862 --> 18:56.724
This woman is dangerous,
bottom line,

18:56.724 --> 18:58.413
and if you go in there
and blow up her spot,

18:58.413 --> 18:59.517
she's gonna
lash out on you,

18:59.517 --> 19:00.689
and we don't know
what that looks like.

19:00.689 --> 19:02.413
You got to trust me.

19:02.413 --> 19:03.689
My guy's coming up
with a plan

19:03.689 --> 19:06.034
to get her out of your life
safely, without blowback.

19:06.034 --> 19:08.068
So what?
I'm supposed to just --

19:08.068 --> 19:09.275
Y-You just go home.

19:09.275 --> 19:11.275
Act like you don't know
what you know.

19:11.275 --> 19:13.586
We'll fix it.

19:13.586 --> 19:16.103
She's gonna pay
for what she did to you,

19:16.103 --> 19:18.379
100%.

19:18.379 --> 19:19.862
She better.

19:23.965 --> 19:25.413
What are you doing?

19:25.413 --> 19:27.137
This.
This is what I'm doing --

19:27.137 --> 19:28.379
finally telling you
the truth.

19:28.379 --> 19:29.586
Tina --
No, shut up.

19:29.586 --> 19:31.310
It's time for you
to listen.

19:31.310 --> 19:33.724
I'm worried about you.

19:33.724 --> 19:35.586
Another lie.

19:35.586 --> 19:37.068
You're not worried.

19:37.068 --> 19:38.137
You're scared.

19:38.137 --> 19:39.482
You're scared that maybe

19:39.482 --> 19:41.482
if I'm feeling
some type of way about you,

19:41.482 --> 19:43.689
I can go to the press
and reveal your lies,

19:43.689 --> 19:44.896
show them
who you really are,

19:44.896 --> 19:46.724
and that wouldn't be good
for your career.

19:46.724 --> 19:48.241
You're scared.

19:48.241 --> 19:50.931
Guess what?
I like that.

19:50.931 --> 19:55.068
You hide behind this sweet,
conflicted moral exterior,

19:55.068 --> 19:57.896
when deep inside,
you are a vapid little bitch

19:57.896 --> 19:59.965
who uses her past
to justify

19:59.965 --> 20:01.862
all the terrible things
she does to people.

20:01.862 --> 20:03.758
That is not true.
You know it is,

20:03.758 --> 20:05.793
but if you believed it,
you would just kill yourself.

20:07.413 --> 20:11.310
I came here
to tell you the truth --

20:11.310 --> 20:15.862
that no amount of money,
fame, or love

20:15.862 --> 20:19.793
is gonna make you happy,
because you are evil.

20:21.344 --> 20:23.413
You are evil, Jill.

20:23.413 --> 20:25.103
You need to know that.

20:25.103 --> 20:28.379
You're gonna get what's coming
to you, Jill, I promise.

20:28.379 --> 20:30.862
Your reckoning is coming
very soon.

20:51.137 --> 20:53.655
Wait, you didn't tell me
your date was here.

20:53.655 --> 20:55.344
Didn't think it was important.
Is it?

20:55.344 --> 20:56.517
No.

20:59.068 --> 21:02.344
I can't do it.
I can't go in there.

21:02.344 --> 21:04.000
What? Why?
You'll be fine.

21:04.000 --> 21:06.068
You look good.
Just be chill.

21:06.068 --> 21:07.655
Bree, what's going on?

21:07.655 --> 21:10.586
If you think you're gonna
sabotage this, call me.

21:10.586 --> 21:11.655
Sorry.

21:12.758 --> 21:14.241
Bree.

21:16.827 --> 21:18.965
You look amazing.

21:18.965 --> 21:20.379
Well, these aren't
my clothes,

21:20.379 --> 21:22.793
and I'm still wearing the makeup
from my press conference.

21:22.793 --> 21:24.724
I stared at my closet
for five hours,

21:24.724 --> 21:26.275
trying to find
the perfect outfit.

21:26.275 --> 21:27.620
You look nice.

21:27.620 --> 21:28.724
Why did you say that

21:28.724 --> 21:31.413
like someone programmed
to be on a date?

21:31.413 --> 21:32.827
Honest answer?

21:32.827 --> 21:34.206
Who says no to that?

21:34.206 --> 21:35.517
This ain't
my thing, man.

21:35.517 --> 21:36.517
Wine?

21:36.517 --> 21:37.551
Dates.

21:37.551 --> 21:38.689
Oh, me neither.

21:38.689 --> 21:40.068
Then what are we doing?

21:40.068 --> 21:42.689
Getting to know interesting
people <i>is</i> my thing.

21:42.689 --> 21:44.379
We just happen to be
at a table,

21:44.379 --> 21:46.034
drinking wine
in a restaurant,

21:46.034 --> 21:49.379
doing what a majority of the
world considers to be a date,

21:49.379 --> 21:52.379
but I'd get to know you
anywhere.

21:52.379 --> 21:53.862
Hm.

21:56.482 --> 21:57.965
You're hot.

21:57.965 --> 21:58.965
Thank you.

21:58.965 --> 22:00.379
You think I'm hot?

22:00.379 --> 22:04.310
Incredibly simplified,
but...yeah.

22:04.310 --> 22:07.206
Then let's get to where we
both know we want this to go.

22:10.448 --> 22:14.034
That sounds...easy.

22:14.965 --> 22:18.758
You don't strike me as someone
who likes easy or simple,

22:18.758 --> 22:21.344
and I know I don't.

22:21.344 --> 22:25.000
Anything rewarding is
a little...difficult,

22:25.000 --> 22:26.482
a little uncomfortable.

22:26.482 --> 22:28.379
You feel that way
about music, right?

22:30.655 --> 22:32.344
Yeah.

22:32.344 --> 22:34.275
Then I have to say no.

22:34.275 --> 22:37.896
As tempting
as that sounds,

22:37.896 --> 22:40.413
I can't let you off the hook
<i>that</i> easily.

22:41.931 --> 22:43.758
What looks good?

22:48.103 --> 22:50.241
"
playing ]

22:52.068 --> 22:54.103
Lots more people here
than I'm comfortable with.

22:54.103 --> 22:55.068
Come on.

23:02.137 --> 23:03.655
I thought you said
dude was old.

23:03.655 --> 23:05.862
His name is
Walter Westcott.

23:05.862 --> 23:07.827
That's all the investigating
you did?

23:07.827 --> 23:09.655
Ohh, snap!

23:09.655 --> 23:12.137
Le Muff Muff
has arrived.

23:12.137 --> 23:13.655
Walter Westcott.

23:13.655 --> 23:15.793
Where's the money?

23:15.793 --> 23:16.896
You brought your pops?

23:16.896 --> 23:20.172
Dis my manager.
It's all good, Double Dub.

23:20.172 --> 23:22.068
Oh, Walter Westcott.
Double Dub.

23:22.068 --> 23:24.586
I knew you'd be sharp.
I told everyone you'd be sharp.

23:24.586 --> 23:25.724
The money?

23:25.724 --> 23:28.000
This is the launch party
for my new app.

23:28.000 --> 23:30.275
Pretty cool, right?
What's the app?

23:30.275 --> 23:33.172
Doesn't have a name yet,
but we've raised $80 million.

23:33.172 --> 23:34.448
That sound like a hustle.

23:34.448 --> 23:37.379
Insane compliment,
coming from you.

23:37.379 --> 23:38.413
Come with me.

23:38.413 --> 23:39.793
She isn't going anywhere
without me

23:39.793 --> 23:41.758
or without
getting the money first.

23:41.758 --> 23:44.103
I'm a billionaire, bro.
We're good.

23:45.275 --> 23:47.482
Shall we?

23:47.482 --> 23:49.137
So are the fleeces,
like, a uniform,

23:49.137 --> 23:50.310
or just a lame coincidence?

24:20.379 --> 24:22.172
I don't have any condoms.

24:22.172 --> 24:23.482
<i>What?</i>

24:23.482 --> 24:25.655
Lemme guess --
you're sabotaging.

24:25.655 --> 24:27.793
<i>He's cool. </i>
It was going fine.

24:27.793 --> 24:28.965
We were flirting.

24:28.965 --> 24:30.586
Then he started asking
all kinds of questions,

24:30.586 --> 24:31.896
trying to
get to know me for real.

24:31.896 --> 24:33.344
Ooh, the bastard.

24:33.344 --> 24:35.448
Lemme Google the most painful
way to kill a man.

24:35.448 --> 24:36.551
Bree, I'm serious.

24:36.551 --> 24:37.689
I-I know.

24:37.689 --> 24:39.413
That's what's scary.

24:39.413 --> 24:41.413
<i>Ooh, I'm kinda drunk, yo.</i>

24:41.413 --> 24:43.965
See, this is why I don't date.
It delays sex.

24:43.965 --> 24:45.896
<i>You can get sex anywhere.</i>

24:45.896 --> 24:48.413
Finding a connection,
someone you vibe with,

24:48.413 --> 24:52.172
someone who's into you --
that's what you need.

24:52.172 --> 24:54.379
That's what I had.

24:54.379 --> 24:56.137
I've known you
since we were 14.

24:56.137 --> 24:57.586
And when you spin out
like this,

24:57.586 --> 24:59.379
I know the words
coming out of your mouth

24:59.379 --> 25:02.000
do not line up
with how you feel.

25:02.000 --> 25:03.206
You're spinning out
because --

25:03.206 --> 25:04.344
I like him.

25:04.344 --> 25:06.275
That's what's up.

25:06.275 --> 25:08.482
I haven't heard you say that
for real for real

25:08.482 --> 25:09.655
<i>since 10th grade.</i>

25:09.655 --> 25:11.241
It's scary.

25:11.241 --> 25:12.724
<i>It's good.</i>

25:12.724 --> 25:14.103
I know.

25:14.103 --> 25:18.137
But, yo, you good?
Why'd you leave like that?

25:18.137 --> 25:19.862
I'm good.

25:19.862 --> 25:22.068
I'm only not good
if you sabotage this date.

25:22.068 --> 25:25.724
<i>Alright. I'm going back.</i>

25:25.724 --> 25:27.172
<i>Thank you.</i>

25:27.172 --> 25:29.206
Always.

25:49.827 --> 25:51.862
Oh.

25:55.482 --> 25:59.275
You have every channel.
It is amazing.

25:59.275 --> 26:03.172
What's your cable bill?

26:03.172 --> 26:05.551
I don't know.

26:07.482 --> 26:10.206
Sit down. Relax.

26:10.206 --> 26:13.103
I made dinner.
I'll bring it in to you.

26:18.241 --> 26:20.724
What do you want,
<i>Valentina?</i>

26:23.517 --> 26:25.896
Let's talk about this.

26:25.896 --> 26:29.172
Game over, <i>bitch.</i>

26:29.172 --> 26:31.310
Honey, why do you always

26:31.310 --> 26:32.724
keep looking for
some ulterior motive?

26:32.724 --> 26:33.862
I saw your rap sheet.

26:33.862 --> 26:36.241
You can't con your way
out of this.

26:36.241 --> 26:37.448
Leave!

26:39.793 --> 26:41.172
I'll pack.

26:42.931 --> 26:44.827
Do you know
who my real mom is?

26:44.827 --> 26:47.275
You want me to leave?
I'm leaving.

26:47.275 --> 26:48.586
I'm going to the cops.

26:48.586 --> 26:51.551
You are
<i>not</i> going to do that.
Aah!

26:51.551 --> 26:53.896
You belong in jail.

26:53.896 --> 26:56.689
I am never
going back to jail.

26:56.689 --> 26:58.758
Let go.

26:58.758 --> 27:00.034
Let go.

27:02.551 --> 27:04.586
You won't
go to the cops,

27:04.586 --> 27:07.827
because now you know
what I'm capable of,

27:07.827 --> 27:11.000
but also 'cause I have
the one piece of information

27:11.000 --> 27:15.241
that your sad, 40-year-old
little-girl self wants --

27:15.241 --> 27:17.620
I know who your mom is.

27:17.620 --> 27:21.034
How would I be able to
pull this fraud off if I didn't?

27:21.034 --> 27:24.586
I knew she didn't want
anything to do with you

27:24.586 --> 27:26.551
and would <i>never</i> reach out,

27:26.551 --> 27:29.758
so I took my shot.

27:29.758 --> 27:31.896
I missed.

27:33.482 --> 27:35.620
What's her name?

27:39.448 --> 27:41.655
You let me go quietly,

27:41.655 --> 27:42.689
and you can have it.

27:42.689 --> 27:45.034
I want you
out of my life.

27:45.034 --> 27:48.551
No cops, and you will never
hear from me again.

27:54.379 --> 27:57.068
Rosalind Marquez.

27:57.068 --> 27:59.310
How do I know
you're not lying?

28:01.551 --> 28:04.758
Everything you read about me
is true,

28:04.758 --> 28:10.241
but most of those
really terrible things I did?

28:10.241 --> 28:12.034
I never got caught.

28:12.034 --> 28:13.413
Don't try me, honey.

28:13.413 --> 28:14.793
Keep your word.

28:14.793 --> 28:16.724
I kept mine.

28:32.413 --> 28:33.655
I like your hair.

28:33.655 --> 28:35.034
Super cool.

28:36.344 --> 28:38.689
Nasty fingers
don't touch this do.

28:40.586 --> 28:43.310
Muffalicious.
Mm-hmm.

28:43.310 --> 28:45.172
I've got a surprise
for you.

28:45.172 --> 28:46.655
Come hither.

28:48.137 --> 28:50.379
World-class blow.

28:51.965 --> 28:54.034
Rehab was a stunt,
right?

28:55.965 --> 28:58.137
I'm Gucci.
Oh!

28:58.137 --> 29:01.793
You think I'm gonna
- give you 250
- K for selfies?

29:01.793 --> 29:05.137
I'm paying for
the full Muffin experience.

29:05.137 --> 29:06.379
Look, I know
you probably didn't

29:06.379 --> 29:08.379
go to business school like me,
but I'm the customer.

29:08.379 --> 29:09.448
I bought a product,

29:09.448 --> 29:12.206
and the customer
is always right. Huh?

29:13.965 --> 29:15.448
Walk away.

29:15.448 --> 29:17.103
Oh, bad move, boss.

29:17.103 --> 29:18.689
Get him out of here.

29:21.310 --> 29:23.137
I'm not leaving until
she gets her guap

29:23.137 --> 29:24.482
and I know she's safe.

29:24.482 --> 29:27.931
Okay. Are you gonna
do this blow, or what?

29:27.931 --> 29:29.206
Hmm?

29:32.103 --> 29:33.275
It's okay.

29:34.827 --> 29:36.827
I can't let you do this.

29:36.827 --> 29:38.517
We out.

29:38.517 --> 29:40.862
Alright. Make sure they both
find the door, then.

29:40.862 --> 29:43.137
Go!

29:47.793 --> 29:49.034
I'm sorry.

29:49.034 --> 29:52.206
Nah, I'm sorry.

29:55.551 --> 29:56.862
Thanks for dinner.

29:56.862 --> 29:59.137
My pleasure.

30:00.655 --> 30:02.517
I'm really glad
we did this.

30:02.517 --> 30:04.068
Me too.

30:33.413 --> 30:35.655
You're going on tour.

30:35.655 --> 30:36.862
I am.

30:36.862 --> 30:39.206
Which means I won't see you
for awhile.

30:39.206 --> 30:41.586
So, can we keep
this night going?

30:41.586 --> 30:44.586
There's this amazing speakeasy
around the corner.

30:44.586 --> 30:46.827
Look, it doesn't have
to be that, but...

30:46.827 --> 30:48.689
I'm not ready
to say goodbye.

30:51.068 --> 30:52.862
Let's do it.
Perfect.

30:55.379 --> 30:56.517
Wait a minute.

31:00.103 --> 31:01.965
What's wrong?

31:01.965 --> 31:03.172
It's Bree.
I don't know.

31:03.172 --> 31:05.448
Something's up.

31:06.896 --> 31:08.344
Listen, I don't --
I don't want the night

31:08.344 --> 31:10.310
to end, either,
but my girl needs me.

31:11.862 --> 31:13.275
I get it.

31:13.275 --> 31:15.137
Now, this is the last time
you're gonna hear me say this,

31:15.137 --> 31:17.586
but...go.

31:28.655 --> 31:31.448
I know a <i>hit.</i>

31:31.448 --> 31:33.655
That's a hit!

31:35.000 --> 31:36.586
What's up? You good?

31:36.586 --> 31:38.000
Yeah. All good.

31:38.000 --> 31:40.620
Jill, you got this.

31:40.620 --> 31:42.655
I want to be
straight up with you.

31:42.655 --> 31:45.620
I want to produce
your solo album.

31:45.620 --> 31:48.482
I mean, you're
a one-of-a-kind talent.

31:48.482 --> 31:51.206
Go on tour
with the Queens,

31:51.206 --> 31:53.241
then we get started
as soon as you land.

31:53.241 --> 31:55.413
Hell, I'll pick you up
from the airport.

31:55.413 --> 31:58.551
I-I -- Wow.
I mean, I'm flattered, truly.

32:00.448 --> 32:01.689
But?

32:01.689 --> 32:04.310
I'm supposed to record
a Queens album after the tour.

32:04.310 --> 32:05.965
Damn.

32:05.965 --> 32:08.655
I love the group.
I mean, I can't front.

32:08.655 --> 32:10.344
The Nasty Bitches,

32:10.344 --> 32:13.000
they paved the way
for a lot of female artists.

32:13.000 --> 32:15.896
But I think you might be
selling yourself short

32:15.896 --> 32:18.310
until you see what
you can do on your own.

32:18.310 --> 32:21.655
'Cause, you know, groups --

32:21.655 --> 32:23.896
they don't really
last forever.

32:26.310 --> 32:29.482
I...

32:32.344 --> 32:34.310
I can't.

32:34.310 --> 32:36.586
I mean,
the Queens are the reason

32:36.586 --> 32:39.310
I even have a voice
for you to want.

32:39.310 --> 32:40.758
I would have never
found the courage

32:40.758 --> 32:42.379
to come out
at the BET Awards

32:42.379 --> 32:46.137
if they weren't up there
with me, supporting me.

32:46.137 --> 32:48.551
And all I've done is
lie and manipulate

32:48.551 --> 32:51.103
the people I care about
for my own benefit.

32:53.379 --> 32:55.379
I'm sorry.

32:55.379 --> 32:58.241
I just can't hurt
any more people I love.

32:59.896 --> 33:01.206
Fair enough.

33:02.413 --> 33:04.206
But thank you.

33:44.655 --> 33:47.034
I'm sorry
I ruined your night.

33:47.034 --> 33:49.965
Naomi:
No, I had a great night.

33:49.965 --> 33:52.586
I just lost it
when I saw that restaurant.

33:52.586 --> 33:54.827
You know, I thought I got
over the whole grief thing

33:54.827 --> 33:57.068
that everybody
tells you about,

33:57.068 --> 33:58.172
but I guess not.

33:58.172 --> 34:00.448
Jeff was my <i>homie.</i>

34:01.620 --> 34:02.862
Let's never get out of
this bed again.

34:02.862 --> 34:04.758
Mm.
I'm down with that.

34:04.758 --> 34:07.379
I should have been there
for you back then.

34:07.379 --> 34:09.896
The whole Eric mess, Jojo?

34:09.896 --> 34:11.793
Mm.
You went through that
all alone.

34:11.793 --> 34:13.206
I wish I would have known.

34:13.206 --> 34:14.931
I wish I would have
been there.

34:14.931 --> 34:16.724
You're here now.

34:18.206 --> 34:20.620
- Ooh!
- The front door was open,

34:20.620 --> 34:22.655
and I brought in
some more company.

34:22.655 --> 34:24.448
- Mm.
- Mmm!

34:24.448 --> 34:26.068
I <i>need</i> them.

34:27.310 --> 34:29.931
So, how was your date?

34:29.931 --> 34:31.931
Oh. Good.
Like, <i>really</i> good.

34:32.931 --> 34:36.172
Listen,
I know I haven't been myself

34:36.172 --> 34:40.206
these past couple of months,
but I'm...

34:40.206 --> 34:42.068
figuring it out?

34:42.068 --> 34:43.103
I'm sorry.

34:43.103 --> 34:44.793
I mean, what does V
always say?

34:44.793 --> 34:46.724
There's always a messed-up
member in the family?

34:46.724 --> 34:48.655
I think we all
pass that honor around.

34:48.655 --> 34:50.000
Yes, we do.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.448
Ooh. Damn.

34:55.689 --> 34:57.137
Oh, that's so good.

34:57.137 --> 34:58.482
Hm.

34:58.482 --> 35:00.206
What?

35:01.137 --> 35:03.068
Before Jeff's surgery,

35:03.068 --> 35:05.586
he gave me this
in case he didn't make it.

35:06.448 --> 35:08.344
You gonna open it?

35:09.448 --> 35:10.931
We can leave
if you want.

35:10.931 --> 35:13.965
<i>No.</i> Stay.

35:18.482 --> 35:20.275
What the hell?

35:24.137 --> 35:25.482
Hey, Bree.

35:27.172 --> 35:29.689
Well
if you're watching this,

35:29.689 --> 35:31.517
I guess I didn't make it.

35:31.517 --> 35:33.034
<i>And that is annoying,</i>

35:33.034 --> 35:35.137
<i>because I know things have </i>
not been great between us.

35:35.137 --> 35:37.862
<i>That's my bad, obviously.</i>

35:37.862 --> 35:40.000
<i>All I can say is, Bree,</i>

35:40.000 --> 35:43.793
<i>I'll never forgive myself </i>
for hurting you.

35:43.793 --> 35:46.448
<i>You're beautiful. </i>
You're wonderful.

35:46.448 --> 35:48.448
<i>You're a force.</i>

35:48.448 --> 35:50.586
<i>And you deserved better.</i>

35:50.586 --> 35:52.655
<i>All these years, you --</i>

35:52.655 --> 35:54.241
you were so selfless,

35:54.241 --> 35:57.068
<i>you know, putting my dreams </i>
and the kids' all before yours,

35:57.068 --> 35:59.206
<i>and I did not realize it</i>

35:59.206 --> 36:01.413
<i>until I saw you slay </i>
at the BET Awards.

36:01.413 --> 36:03.379
<i>Baby, you took my breath away,</i>

36:03.379 --> 36:05.275
<i>and it's not a side effect </i>
of the tumor.

36:05.275 --> 36:06.758
<i>I checked. </i>

36:06.758 --> 36:09.793
<i>Uh, but please,</i>

36:09.793 --> 36:13.000
<i>don't be selfless </i>
all the time.

36:13.000 --> 36:16.206
<i>Whatever makes you happy, </i>
I want you to do it.

36:16.206 --> 36:19.275
<i>Hey, do you remember </i>
our honeymoon?

36:20.586 --> 36:23.379
<i>We were in the jungle </i>
in Piedras Blancas.

36:23.379 --> 36:25.413
<i>We were staying in </i>
that treehouse,

36:25.413 --> 36:28.068
<i>just trying to make babies, </i>
and we made a pact.

36:28.068 --> 36:31.482
<i>We said that one day </i>
we would move back there

36:31.482 --> 36:33.379
<i>with the kids </i>
that we didn't have yet

36:33.379 --> 36:35.827
<i>and we would -- </i>
we would let them grow up

36:35.827 --> 36:39.827
<i>with animals and books </i>
instead of TV.

36:39.827 --> 36:41.724
<i>You remember that?</i>

36:43.586 --> 36:47.241
<i>Well, obviously, </i>
I can't do that anymore,

36:47.241 --> 36:50.551
<i>but if I can </i>
make one last ask of you,

36:50.551 --> 36:54.103
<i>it would be that -- </i>
do whatever makes you happy.

36:54.103 --> 36:56.068
Mm.
<i>And take our kids </i>
to that jungle,

36:56.068 --> 36:59.517
<i>and you tell them </i>
that their father loved them,

36:59.517 --> 37:01.931
<i>and he loved their mother </i>
with all of his heart.

37:01.931 --> 37:04.068
<i>Because I did.</i>

37:04.068 --> 37:05.758
<i>And I still do...</i>

37:08.413 --> 37:10.482
<i>...wherever I am.</i>

37:11.965 --> 37:13.448
<i>I love you.</i>

37:15.758 --> 37:18.448
Oh, Bree.

37:18.448 --> 37:19.758
It's okay.

37:22.172 --> 37:24.931
Oh, wait.

37:24.931 --> 37:28.310
It's from Eric.
Our first billboard is up.

37:28.310 --> 37:29.827
Should we go?

37:32.241 --> 37:34.413
This is too sad.

37:34.413 --> 37:36.103
I need to feel good.

37:36.103 --> 37:37.724
Let's go.
Yeah?

37:37.724 --> 37:41.206
Let's go celebrate all
the hard work that we've done.

37:41.206 --> 37:42.172
- Yes.
- Yes.

37:42.172 --> 37:43.172
Let's do it.

37:43.172 --> 37:44.689
Love you.

37:45.482 --> 37:47.689
The billboard
by Staples Center's up?

37:47.689 --> 37:50.241
Ha, ha! Dope.

37:50.241 --> 37:52.172
Yeah, I'm gonna shoot the crew
a text right now.

38:08.275 --> 38:09.517
What's good?

38:09.517 --> 38:12.172
Obviously nothing --
my pocket's still empty.

38:13.344 --> 38:16.034
I tried. I did.

38:17.482 --> 38:21.137
You gonna have to wait,
or go ahead and pop off.

38:22.896 --> 38:26.551
What it look like, Jada out here
cappin' fools in the street?

38:26.551 --> 38:28.586
I'm a businessman first,
Jones,

38:28.586 --> 38:30.724
and I anticipated
your washed ass

38:30.724 --> 38:32.310
not having my cake,

38:32.310 --> 38:34.551
so I came up with
a proposition.

38:34.551 --> 38:37.172
I went home,
my lady was bumping the Queens,

38:37.172 --> 38:39.724
telling me I had to get her
tickets for our anniversary.

38:41.586 --> 38:43.793
What,
you want free tickets?

38:43.793 --> 38:45.275
This clown.

38:45.275 --> 38:48.724
Nah, I want in on the profits.
10% partners.

38:48.724 --> 38:50.275
Up to the $750,000
I owe you?

38:50.275 --> 38:51.655
The other deal expired

38:51.655 --> 38:53.482
when you didn't
have my money on time.

38:53.482 --> 38:56.448
10% total profits.

38:56.448 --> 38:58.413
Yo, it's not my money
to give.

38:58.413 --> 38:59.655
Sound like a "you" problem.

38:59.655 --> 39:01.137
Bro, they'd kill me.

39:01.137 --> 39:03.413
You basically invented
shady accounting.

39:03.413 --> 39:04.896
I'm sure you can
figure something out

39:04.896 --> 39:06.482
without them knowing.

39:11.137 --> 39:12.724
I can't do that to them.

39:14.620 --> 39:16.931
Get him in the car.

39:16.931 --> 39:20.517
We need to have a more
intimate, persuasive dialogue.

39:22.034 --> 39:23.517
Ahh!

39:51.379 --> 39:52.827
I let 'em get away.

39:54.551 --> 39:56.000
I let 'em get aw--

39:59.517 --> 40:01.000
Jill:
Dear Lord, thank you

40:01.000 --> 40:03.689
for getting me back in touch
with my sisters.

40:05.482 --> 40:07.965
We didn't know
we needed each other, but we do.

40:09.344 --> 40:14.310
And, Lord, give us the strength
to stand in our truth,

40:14.310 --> 40:16.965
in who we are.

40:16.965 --> 40:19.172
Thank you.

40:19.172 --> 40:20.275
Amen.

40:20.275 --> 40:21.896
- Amen.
- Amen.

40:21.896 --> 40:24.137
Oh, my God!

40:24.137 --> 40:25.793
Stay with me. Stay with me.
Come on, come on.

40:25.793 --> 40:26.793
Stay with me.
Stay with me.

40:26.793 --> 40:28.517
- Bree!
- Bree?

40:28.517 --> 40:30.655
- Bree?

40:30.655 --> 40:32.137
Who was that?!
Oh, my God.

40:32.137 --> 40:33.758
- Bree, Bree.
- Who was that?

40:33.758 --> 40:35.103
- Bree, Bree.
- Who was that?!

40:35.103 --> 40:36.827
We need help.
My friend just got shot.

40:36.827 --> 40:40.586
- Bree. Stay with me, Bree.

40:40.586 --> 40:41.758
Bree?

40:41.758 --> 40:43.896
Yes. Yeah, she is, yes.

40:47.413 --> 40:48.862
It's okay. It's okay.
