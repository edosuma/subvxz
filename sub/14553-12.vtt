WEBVTT

00:51.779 --> 00:54.102
You should do your job,
that's what I'm trying to say.

00:54.215 --> 00:57.206
You should do your job,
because it's your job,

00:57.319 --> 00:58.641
because you're
the person standing there

00:58.754 --> 01:02.245
doing that thing,
so just do it!

01:02.358 --> 01:04.280
Do the shit out of it.

01:04.393 --> 01:06.549
Why wouldn't you?

01:06.662 --> 01:09.018
It drives me crazy when someone
has a job that they don't like

01:09.131 --> 01:11.253
so they do it shitty.

01:11.366 --> 01:13.555
What kind of a response
is that?

01:13.668 --> 01:17.124
If you do it shitty,
isn't it worse for you?

01:17.237 --> 01:18.492
Like, I travel,
so I have to--

01:18.605 --> 01:20.226
I need help all the time.

01:20.339 --> 01:21.661
And I go-- like,
I rent a car

01:21.774 --> 01:23.440
and I always
want another one-- I'm crazy.

01:23.553 --> 01:24.554
So I get a car, I'm like,
"I don't like that.

01:24.667 --> 01:26.033
I want another car."

01:26.146 --> 01:28.403
So I go to the counter,
"Can I get a different car ?"

01:28.516 --> 01:29.850
And sometimes I get the person
who's like--

01:32.053 --> 01:33.409
"Why ?"

01:33.522 --> 01:34.778
'Cause I'm a dick!

01:34.891 --> 01:35.946
Give it to me.

01:36.059 --> 01:38.075
Why-- what do you--
what do you...

01:38.188 --> 01:39.188
"What's wrong with it ?"

01:39.301 --> 01:41.886
I'm crazy
is what's wrong with it.

01:41.999 --> 01:44.588
You're-- you're wearing a vest
that matches the building,

01:44.701 --> 01:47.404
just do the thing that
is the point of the place.

01:49.650 --> 01:50.650
"Uhh."

01:50.763 --> 01:52.596
Why ?!

01:52.709 --> 01:53.531
You know why?

01:53.644 --> 01:55.466
'Cause you're 20, that's why.

01:55.579 --> 01:57.735
'Cause you're a 20-year-old
little

01:57.848 --> 02:00.704
and you have no idea
how the world works,

02:00.817 --> 02:04.141
because you think you
deserve better...

02:04.254 --> 02:08.380
you think you're
too interesting a person

02:08.493 --> 02:11.449
to have a shitty job.

02:11.562 --> 02:14.394
Every 20-year-old that
I encounter behind the counter

02:14.507 --> 02:15.508
gives me that look.

02:15.621 --> 02:16.820
"Oh, this job sucks."

02:16.933 --> 02:19.902
Yeah, that's why
we gave it to you.

02:23.140 --> 02:25.730
Because you're 20!

02:25.843 --> 02:27.599
Which is a mathematical
guarantee

02:27.719 --> 02:32.549
that you have no skills and nothing
to offer anybody in the world.

02:33.485 --> 02:34.907
You're 20!

02:35.020 --> 02:37.910
For two decades, you've just
been taking and sucking up.

02:38.023 --> 02:39.123
Education...

02:40.325 --> 02:42.114
... and love
and food and iPods,

02:42.227 --> 02:44.216
just sucking it up
and judging it.

02:44.329 --> 02:45.651
"Yeah, it's pretty good,

02:45.764 --> 02:47.553
but not really,
I don't like that..."

02:47.666 --> 02:50.055
You've just been selecting

02:50.168 --> 02:54.125
and absorbing shit that
you didn't ( bleep ) earn.

02:54.238 --> 02:57.829
For two decades!

02:57.942 --> 03:01.065
Three presidents,
that's how long

03:01.178 --> 03:05.236
you've just been a burden.

03:05.349 --> 03:07.539
You're like an orange that's
rotting on a tree

03:07.652 --> 03:08.674
and the tree's like,

03:08.787 --> 03:10.909
"Get the-- get--
this thing's crazy."

03:11.022 --> 03:13.190
"Uh, I don't wanna go,
let me stay !"

03:18.764 --> 03:20.587
You're 20,
you've never done any--

03:20.700 --> 03:22.522
If you're 20 years old,
I guarantee you,

03:22.635 --> 03:28.194
you have never done
anything for anybody, ever.

03:28.307 --> 03:29.429
Never.

03:29.542 --> 03:32.198
Yes, you went on
a school trip to Guatemala

03:32.311 --> 03:35.146
and they told you you helped
but you totally did not help.

03:40.619 --> 03:42.942
The guy was like,
I got a mudslide on my house

03:43.055 --> 03:45.044
and now I gotta babysit
a ( bleep ) college kid.

03:45.157 --> 03:47.780
Why do I have to do this?

03:47.893 --> 03:49.015
Jesus.

03:49.128 --> 03:50.216
"Ehh."

03:50.329 --> 03:51.618
Just take her
picture with a shovel

03:51.731 --> 03:53.964
and send her home so she can
put it on Facebook.

03:59.304 --> 04:01.527
"I had an amazing
experience in Guatemala,

04:01.640 --> 04:02.929
"it was totally amazing

04:03.042 --> 04:06.031
and I really helped those
people, I helped them."

04:59.328 --> 05:00.750
<i>Attention, ladies and gentlemen,</i>

05:00.863 --> 05:03.620
<i>if you hear a series of</i>
<i>loud noises,</i>

05:03.733 --> 05:06.423
<i>this is from construction</i>
<i>going on at Grand Central.</i>

05:06.536 --> 05:07.892
<i>Please do not be alarmed.</i>

05:08.005 --> 05:09.505
<i>Thank you.</i>

05:15.179 --> 05:16.435
Hey, Carlene.
Thank you for doing this.

05:16.548 --> 05:18.838
I have no choice.

05:18.951 --> 05:20.306
I need to get back
on this train

05:20.419 --> 05:22.008
to Philadelphia right now.

05:22.121 --> 05:23.676
I will be back
for her in two days.

05:23.789 --> 05:25.344
But you're both
staying with me.

05:25.457 --> 05:27.312
That was the plan.
No.

05:27.425 --> 05:28.714
Just her, two days.

05:28.827 --> 05:30.182
Louie, please.

05:30.295 --> 05:31.550
That's not what you said
that you were gonna do.

05:31.663 --> 05:33.585
I was afraid, okay?

05:33.698 --> 05:35.987
I mean, how could I ask you to do this for me?
Well, you're not asking,

05:36.100 --> 05:39.223
you're just apparently doing it.
Louie, I'm sorry.

05:39.336 --> 05:40.657
I need to go to Philadelphia

05:40.770 --> 05:43.760
and I need her
not to go with me.

05:43.873 --> 05:45.674
Just, please.

05:48.845 --> 05:50.513
I don't know anybody her age!

05:53.818 --> 05:55.774
She's 13.

05:55.887 --> 05:57.509
You don't need to do
much for her.

05:57.622 --> 05:59.123
I have to go.

06:01.627 --> 06:03.495
You've gotta be shitting me.

06:17.144 --> 06:18.633
Where's my mom?

06:18.746 --> 06:19.901
She's gone.

06:20.014 --> 06:21.769
Forever?

06:21.882 --> 06:24.706
No, just--
just a couple of days.

06:24.819 --> 06:26.286
Okay.

06:27.755 --> 06:29.623
Hey, hey, excuse me.

06:33.995 --> 06:35.784
Hey.

06:35.897 --> 06:37.720
Amy?

06:37.833 --> 06:40.222
Amy?

06:40.335 --> 06:41.724
Amy, hey...

06:41.837 --> 06:42.903
Hey, listen, you can't...

06:44.973 --> 06:46.373
Please, Amy...

06:47.204 --> 06:50.178
Don't... Look, I need you to.. To...

06:51.279 --> 06:52.768
Um, we're gonna
go back to my--

06:52.881 --> 06:54.282
Amy!

07:13.134 --> 07:14.817
Thank you for stopping.

07:14.930 --> 07:15.930
All right.

07:16.043 --> 07:17.659
We need to
make some rules here.

07:17.772 --> 07:18.893
No more running away.

07:19.006 --> 07:20.328
This is a big city

07:20.441 --> 07:22.397
and it's not cool for
you to run away from me.

07:22.510 --> 07:25.233
Now we'rgonna go back to my
place and we'll figure out--

07:25.346 --> 07:26.769
Dude, what did I--

07:26.882 --> 07:28.704
What did I just say,
what did I just say?

07:28.817 --> 07:29.817
What did I-- Amy!

07:33.121 --> 07:35.210
This is, uh, home.

07:35.323 --> 07:36.323
Come on.

07:38.560 --> 07:42.517
Uh... this is
where I live.

07:42.630 --> 07:46.188
I guess you could stay
in, uh...

07:46.301 --> 07:48.212
Lilly and Jane's room.

07:48.332 --> 07:49.991
I don't know
if you remember them.

07:50.104 --> 07:51.560
They were very little
last time you saw them,

07:51.673 --> 07:55.437
but you can be in here
if you want, if you--

08:18.590 --> 08:19.717
Hey, Amy.

08:23.798 --> 08:26.521
Amy, it's been about four hours
and I don't have any--

08:26.634 --> 08:28.408
I haven't heard
a sound in there.

08:29.341 --> 08:31.526
Listen, I gotta know
you're not a dead kid

08:31.639 --> 08:34.128
in my house right now,
so I'm--

08:34.241 --> 08:37.231
Amy?

08:37.344 --> 08:40.235
All right, I'm gonna open
the door, have to come in.

08:40.348 --> 08:43.871
I don't wanna breach a thing,
but I gotta walk in the room,

08:43.984 --> 08:45.172
to be a responsible grownup.

08:45.285 --> 08:46.407
So here's me--

08:46.520 --> 08:47.542
This is me coming in, okay?

08:47.655 --> 08:49.087
Here I go.

08:52.826 --> 08:53.992
Oh.

08:55.428 --> 08:56.750
You wanna get
something to--

08:56.863 --> 08:57.951
You want some food or...

08:58.064 --> 08:59.118
We'll get some--

08:59.231 --> 09:02.888
I wanna go to Fontana's.

09:03.001 --> 09:04.891
You wanna go what?

09:05.004 --> 09:06.392
To Fontana's.

09:06.505 --> 09:08.094
It's an indie rock club.

09:08.207 --> 09:09.541
I wanna go there.

10:06.534 --> 10:08.068
Did you like the show?

10:12.440 --> 10:14.262
Hey, listen, do you wanna
get something to eat?

10:14.375 --> 10:16.364
This is-- this is Chinatown.

10:16.477 --> 10:19.201
It's renowned Chinese food
and we could get--

10:19.314 --> 10:21.736
I gotta get you
to eat something.

10:21.849 --> 10:23.806
I'm not gonna die
if I don't eat.

10:23.919 --> 10:25.620
Yeah, you actually are.

10:28.157 --> 10:29.779
Is it true you're a comedian?

10:29.892 --> 10:31.514
Uh-huh.

10:31.627 --> 10:33.316
Can I see you do a show?

10:33.429 --> 10:34.918
No, that's--
that's not a good idea.

10:35.031 --> 10:36.720
Why?

10:36.833 --> 10:38.255
Because yoe say "shit"
and ""

10:38.368 --> 10:40.858
and talk about bad things?

10:40.971 --> 10:42.092
Yeah.

10:42.205 --> 10:43.894
My mom says
all the time.

10:44.007 --> 10:47.797
She screams it, in my face.

10:47.910 --> 10:49.999
Jesus.

10:50.112 --> 10:52.835
I'd like to see your show.

10:52.948 --> 10:54.604
Li, sten, Amy, I don't know
the depth of how bad

10:54.717 --> 10:56.239
things are in
your home and I--

10:56.352 --> 10:58.307
Your mom had a hard life,
all right?

10:58.420 --> 11:00.288
And I know that
that's not your...

11:01.923 --> 11:03.845
I'd like to see a comedy show.

11:03.958 --> 11:05.892
Can I see you do a show?

11:09.852 --> 11:10.852
Yeah, okay.

11:10.965 --> 11:11.965
Come on.

11:14.001 --> 11:15.323
I mean, 'cause this is
New York, right?

11:15.436 --> 11:17.192
So there's a lot
of immigrants, right?

11:17.305 --> 11:18.593
We got a lot of immigrants
here, right?

11:18.706 --> 11:19.528
Yeah, so--

11:19.641 --> 11:21.596
Um... where you guys from?

11:21.709 --> 11:24.532
Where's this
Internet team from?

11:24.645 --> 11:25.867
Holy...

11:25.980 --> 11:27.302
Holy mackerel.

11:27.415 --> 11:29.637
You got the Asian, that's
the leader-- holy mackerel.

11:29.750 --> 11:31.472
It's like--
this is like Benetton.

11:31.585 --> 11:32.640
Hey!

11:32.753 --> 11:35.343
All you need is me, huh?

11:35.456 --> 11:36.611
Where you guys from,
where you guys from?

11:36.724 --> 11:38.280
You guys are smart!

11:38.393 --> 11:41.450
He's-- he's funny.

11:41.563 --> 11:42.718
He's doing crowd work.

11:42.831 --> 11:46.355
That's-- that's easy.

11:46.468 --> 11:49.558
Do you do crowd work?

11:49.671 --> 11:52.962
No, but that's just
a difference--

11:53.075 --> 11:55.197
It's...

11:55.310 --> 11:57.512
Bro, pass the high five.

12:00.048 --> 12:02.004
I'm going on next.

12:02.117 --> 12:04.285
Just, I'll be--
I'll see you after.

12:06.488 --> 12:07.710
Oh, no...

12:07.823 --> 12:08.923
Friends?

12:13.896 --> 12:15.184
What is this?

12:15.297 --> 12:18.520
"Friends that really don't
wanna be friends" night?

12:18.633 --> 12:20.121
All right, you guys,
good night, everybody.

12:20.234 --> 12:21.022
I'll see you guys.

12:21.135 --> 12:22.190
Thank you very much!

12:22.303 --> 12:24.004
Peace, I'm out of here,
New York!

12:26.441 --> 12:28.809
Godfrey!

12:30.478 --> 12:31.934
Godfrey!

12:32.047 --> 12:33.202
Mother...

12:33.315 --> 12:35.372
Godfrey in the goddamn building,
everybody!

12:35.485 --> 12:37.674
The next young man
making his way to the stage,

12:37.787 --> 12:39.743
very funny comedian, you've
seen him all over,

12:39.856 --> 12:43.960
give some love
to Louie C.K!

12:49.100 --> 12:50.589
Thank you very much.

12:50.702 --> 12:52.892
Thanks, hi, how are you doing?

12:53.005 --> 12:55.662
I-- I--

12:55.775 --> 12:57.464
You guys look like
a nice crowd.

12:57.577 --> 12:59.399
Where you-- Ma'am,
where are you from?

12:59.512 --> 13:01.068
I already told the last comedian

13:01.181 --> 13:02.679
and he made it really funny.

13:02.792 --> 13:03.793
Oh, he did?
Yeah.

13:03.906 --> 13:05.739
Okay.

13:05.852 --> 13:07.240
Where you from, sir?

13:07.353 --> 13:08.941
Southern California.
Southern California?

13:09.054 --> 13:11.911
That's...

13:12.024 --> 13:13.857
Uh, so...

13:17.061 --> 13:19.617
This is a falafel.

13:19.730 --> 13:21.131
It's Middle Eastern food.

13:23.534 --> 13:24.689
I gotta get you
to eat something.

13:24.802 --> 13:26.103
You can't...

13:28.339 --> 13:29.773
So, Amy, you go to school?

13:32.745 --> 13:34.078
You play any sports?

13:36.582 --> 13:37.782
How old are you, about 13?

13:40.853 --> 13:42.909
Well, Amy, it really has
been nice talking to you.

13:44.689 --> 13:46.378
I'm gonna go ahead and stop.

13:46.491 --> 13:50.449
You can't talk to teenagers,
especially girls.

13:50.562 --> 13:52.985
It's like they walk through
this door into this dark room

13:53.098 --> 13:55.321
and once they're in that room,
nobody can reach 'em.

13:55.434 --> 13:56.956
It's like
they're deaf and dumb.

13:57.069 --> 14:00.392
They're in the wilderness of
hormones and bad ideas.

14:00.505 --> 14:02.794
All's you can do is
look at your watch and wait.

14:02.907 --> 14:05.696
Then at around 16,

14:05.809 --> 14:07.865
they come out and they either
come out people

14:07.978 --> 14:09.099
or they come out whores.

14:09.212 --> 14:11.180
Jesus Christ, man.

14:15.151 --> 14:16.639
What's up, guys, what's up?

14:16.752 --> 14:18.452
How you doing, Godfrey?
Hey. How you doing?

14:24.392 --> 14:25.859
Hi, I'm Godfrey.

14:28.397 --> 14:29.485
What's your name?

14:29.598 --> 14:31.620
Amy.

14:31.733 --> 14:32.922
Nice to meet you, Amy.

14:33.035 --> 14:34.290
All right.

14:34.403 --> 14:36.438
She's my niece.

14:40.376 --> 14:42.132
You from out of town?

14:42.245 --> 14:44.869
Yeah, I'm from Boston.

14:44.982 --> 14:46.371
Boston.

14:46.484 --> 14:48.172
How much do you hate it there?

14:48.285 --> 14:49.285
Very.

14:52.389 --> 14:54.844
Amy, I'm gonna go to
the bathroom now,

14:54.957 --> 14:55.779
so you just wait here, okay?

14:55.892 --> 14:57.792
I'll be right back.

15:05.568 --> 15:07.903
Did you read about Jay-Z
working the party circuit?

15:09.505 --> 15:12.028
... because she invited me
and I knew it was gonna suck,

15:12.141 --> 15:14.497
I knew, like, when I got
the invitation,

15:14.610 --> 15:16.366
you're fine.

15:16.479 --> 15:18.035
It's gonna suck so bad.

15:18.148 --> 15:19.804
... if I let it.

15:19.917 --> 15:22.774
You can't resist it,
though, you have to be like,

15:22.887 --> 15:26.310
let the suck wash over me.

15:26.423 --> 15:27.490
And I'm not gonna resist it.

15:32.863 --> 15:36.020
I totally get you, Amy, I totally do.

15:36.133 --> 15:39.522
It's just that every second,
she has a problem with me.

15:39.635 --> 15:43.125
I can never be myself
and she hates me.

15:43.238 --> 15:45.261
No, no, no, no, no,
she doesn't hate you, okay?

15:45.374 --> 15:46.763
First of all, she's your mom,
all right?

15:46.876 --> 15:49.132
Well, my mom's crazy.

15:49.245 --> 15:52.002
Everybody's mom is crazy.

15:52.115 --> 15:53.970
Serious.

15:54.083 --> 15:57.674
Listen, it's okay, you know,
to push away, you know?

15:57.787 --> 15:59.176
Make some room for yourself,

15:59.289 --> 16:02.079
but don't push too far,
'cause you're gonna need her.

16:02.192 --> 16:04.308
Come 16, you're gonna need Mom.

16:04.421 --> 16:05.421
Ugh.

16:05.534 --> 16:06.717
Ah, yeah.

16:06.830 --> 16:08.785
You're saying, "That bitch
needs to shut up,"

16:08.898 --> 16:11.555
but in three years, you're
gonna be on the phone like,

16:11.668 --> 16:14.765
"Mom, I'm in jail."

16:16.406 --> 16:19.530
"Mom, I need an abortion.

16:19.643 --> 16:22.132
"Mom, come pick me up,

16:22.245 --> 16:24.479
I'm drunk as shit,
I can't drive."

16:26.115 --> 16:27.704
Oh, my God.

16:27.817 --> 16:30.240
I could never
do that with my mom.

16:30.353 --> 16:32.276
You know what, Amy,
you're all right.

16:32.389 --> 16:34.211
Give me some.

16:34.324 --> 16:35.991
All right, I'll see ya.

16:39.462 --> 16:41.551
How did you get her to
talk to you like that?

16:41.664 --> 16:43.820
My girlfriend
has a 13-year-old.

16:43.933 --> 16:44.955
You just gotta learn how to
talk to people

16:45.068 --> 16:46.690
that aren't like you.

16:46.803 --> 16:48.403
It's called empathy, man.

17:04.216 --> 17:05.704
Excuse me, sir.

17:05.817 --> 17:07.172
Can you help me out?

17:07.285 --> 17:09.173
Yeah.

17:09.286 --> 17:10.475
Here you go.
Thank you, God bless you.

17:10.588 --> 17:11.976
Okay, no problem.

17:12.089 --> 17:14.145
You shouldn't do that.
Do what?

17:14.258 --> 17:17.281
Give money to homeless people.

17:17.394 --> 17:19.182
What?

17:19.295 --> 17:21.484
It's demeaning to them.

17:21.597 --> 17:23.286
What's...

17:23.399 --> 17:25.420
How is it demeaning
to help somebody?

17:25.533 --> 17:28.490
Well, you're putting
yourself above them.

17:28.603 --> 17:31.092
It's condescending.

17:31.205 --> 17:33.559
Hey, that guy needed my help
and I gave it to him

17:33.672 --> 17:35.361
and now he can go eat,

17:35.474 --> 17:37.763
he can-- he can
sleep in a warm place,

17:37.876 --> 17:39.197
he can take care of his family.

17:39.310 --> 17:41.066
You only gave him a dollar.

17:41.179 --> 17:42.635
Okay, but it's
a cumulative thing.

17:42.748 --> 17:44.770
It's a lot of people and
I'm one of them, okay--

17:44.883 --> 17:46.506
A lot of-- I'm one of
the people that helps.

17:46.619 --> 17:48.340
You would have him just
staying out in the cold

17:48.453 --> 17:51.776
and getting sick and dying.

17:51.889 --> 17:53.444
You know, I don't know
where you got this shit from

17:53.557 --> 17:55.347
because you're mother's
a liberal freak,

17:55.460 --> 17:56.548
so I don't know
how you got this way.

17:56.661 --> 17:58.316
It's a damn shame, though.

17:58.429 --> 18:00.886
My dad told me that people
who do charity

18:00.999 --> 18:04.090
do it to better
themselves, not others.

18:04.203 --> 18:05.970
Yeah, and then
he ran out on you.

18:12.346 --> 18:14.414
I'm tired, can we just go home?

18:16.606 --> 18:17.606
All right.

18:17.719 --> 18:18.719
Sorry.

19:15.142 --> 19:17.031
Hello?
<i>Hello. I'm calling from Mercy Hospital</i>

19:17.144 --> 19:19.000
<i>in Philadelphia.</i>

19:19.120 --> 19:22.662
<i>We're holding a Carlene Walter,<i>
<i>I believe she's your sister.</i></i></i>

19:22.782 --> 19:25.422
What happened?
<i>It's not clear at this time, sir.</i>

19:25.542 --> 19:28.375
<i>She's being held under observation
We were told to contact you.</i>

19:28.488 --> 19:30.877
Yeah, I have her--
I have her daughter.

19:30.990 --> 19:33.112
I'm-- She's my sister
and I...

19:33.225 --> 19:34.547
Her daughter's with me
here in New York.

19:34.660 --> 19:36.849
<i>All right, well, that's</i>
<i>what we needed to confirm.</i>

19:36.969 --> 19:39.356
What-- Is she okay?
What happened?

19:39.476 --> 19:43.488
<i>She was in a public fountain</i>
<i>acting irrationally.</i>

19:43.601 --> 19:46.524
Oh, my God.

19:46.637 --> 19:48.926
What do I do--
what do I do with her kid?

19:49.039 --> 19:51.328
<i>Do you know how to</i>
<i>contact the father?</i>

19:51.441 --> 19:53.998
No, he's-- he's a bad guy,
he's gone.

19:54.111 --> 19:55.566
<i>Well, if you're</i>
<i>the next of kin,</i>

19:55.679 --> 19:58.903
<i>you should retain custody of</i>
<i>her until her mother is well,</i>

19:59.016 --> 20:02.114
<i>unless, of course, you're not</i>
<i>capable of caring for her.</i>

20:06.091 --> 20:08.515
No.

20:08.628 --> 20:10.190
She'll be okay here.

20:10.310 --> 20:12.619
<i>All right, Sir. Well, let me take</i>
<i> some information from you</i>

20:12.732 --> 20:14.421
<i>so we can further inform you</i>

20:14.534 --> 20:16.423
<i>and coordinate your</i>
<i>niece's care.</i>

20:16.536 --> 20:19.126
<i>I'll need your address,</i>
<i>your place of employment</i>

20:19.239 --> 20:21.407
<i>and any information you can</i>
<i>give us about her mother.</i>
