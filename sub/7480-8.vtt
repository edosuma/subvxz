Whoo!

01:25.848 --> 01:27.949
Yeah!

02:25.410 --> 02:27.211
("Blue Danube Waltz" playing)

02:27.279 --> 02:30.782
HETTY: The waltz was revolutionary
in the late 18th century

02:30.850 --> 02:33.953
because it was the first time
couples faced each other

02:34.020 --> 02:35.888
when they danced.

02:35.956 --> 02:38.158
It was a
scandalous display

02:38.225 --> 02:40.260
of public intimacy.

02:40.328 --> 02:41.528
Public intimacy--
I like it.

02:41.596 --> 02:42.529
Count!

02:42.597 --> 02:44.965
One, two, three.
One, two, three.

02:45.033 --> 02:46.667
He's stepping on me.

02:46.735 --> 02:48.002
DEEKS: That's not true.
You just keep

02:48.070 --> 02:49.871
putting your feet underneath
mine when I lift them.

02:49.939 --> 02:52.840
- You know where I'm gonna put my foot?
- Why are we doing this?

02:52.908 --> 02:56.644
Because you need to face each
other and try to work together.

02:56.712 --> 02:57.846
We do work together.

02:57.913 --> 03:00.315
Yes, not always harmoniously.

03:00.382 --> 03:02.150
Couldn't we do something like
synchronized swimming instead?

03:02.217 --> 03:03.484
Deeks.
What?

03:03.552 --> 03:04.485
It's just like this,

03:04.553 --> 03:05.820
except for you would
be in a bikini.

03:05.887 --> 03:06.687
Ouch!

03:06.755 --> 03:07.788
Sorry.

03:07.856 --> 03:09.657
I was thinking about bikinis.

03:09.724 --> 03:11.191
I'm listening!

03:11.259 --> 03:12.192
Ready?

03:12.260 --> 03:13.227
One, two, three.

03:13.294 --> 03:15.562
HETTY:
Posture, grace,

03:15.630 --> 03:17.064
floating as one.

03:17.132 --> 03:19.033
It's kind of hard to float
when you're in heels. Ow.

03:19.101 --> 03:20.134
Think of your partner.

03:20.202 --> 03:21.436
DEEKS:
Well, it's kind of hard

03:21.504 --> 03:23.138
when all she keeps
talking about

03:23.206 --> 03:25.040
is high heels
and bikinis.

03:25.108 --> 03:27.043
Maybe Kensi should lead.
Isn't that what she's doing?

03:27.110 --> 03:28.077
HETTY:
Really?

03:28.145 --> 03:31.414
I would love
to teach the two of you

03:31.482 --> 03:34.117
the traditional
Viennese Waltz,

03:34.185 --> 03:35.852
with each other as partners.

03:35.920 --> 03:37.321
(chuckles)

03:38.790 --> 03:41.192
(laughs)

03:41.259 --> 03:42.260
(laughs)

03:43.262 --> 03:44.462
She's kidding.

03:47.000 --> 03:49.701
No, she's not.

03:49.769 --> 03:51.370
HETTY:
Agent Hanna,

03:51.438 --> 03:54.273
take your partner by the waist,

03:54.341 --> 03:56.475
back straight.

03:56.543 --> 03:59.646
Do I need to repeat myself?

03:59.713 --> 04:00.980
Hetty, you...

04:01.048 --> 04:02.749
Hetty.
(music stops)

04:02.817 --> 04:04.751
ERIC:
Sorry, guys, but approval's

04:04.818 --> 04:05.818
just come in, Hetty.

04:06.787 --> 04:08.088
HETTY:
NCIS has been granted

04:08.155 --> 04:10.156
permission to enter Mexico.

04:10.224 --> 04:13.694
Well, you'll be
briefed en route.

04:13.761 --> 04:15.395
Grab your go bags.

04:15.463 --> 04:17.898
Wheels up in 20 minutes.

04:17.966 --> 04:19.599
And make sure to return
the heels, Ms. Blye.

04:19.666 --> 04:22.135
You guys owe me big-time.

04:22.203 --> 04:23.903
Anything you need.

04:23.971 --> 04:24.770
Anytime you need it.

04:43.756 --> 04:45.256
Señor Hector Ramirez.

05:13.750 --> 05:14.983
I.D. matches.

05:17.020 --> 05:18.755
Seaman Brandon Davis.

05:18.822 --> 05:20.390
He was reported for
unauthorized absence

05:20.457 --> 05:22.426
from the <i>USS Enterprise</i>
six weeks ago

05:22.493 --> 05:24.161
when the carrier was stationed
off the coast of Sudan.

05:24.229 --> 05:25.196
Hmm.

05:25.263 --> 05:27.265
He's a long way
from North Africa.

05:30.770 --> 05:32.505
Huh.

05:32.572 --> 05:35.174
What makes this
guy so special?

05:35.242 --> 05:36.475
The company he keeps.

05:36.543 --> 05:37.476
You know him?

05:37.544 --> 05:38.477
Paul Green.

05:38.545 --> 05:39.578
He's a British arms dealer.

05:39.646 --> 05:42.114
Sells to al-Qaeda,
Hamas, Hezbollah.

05:42.181 --> 05:44.549
Motorcycle tracks
come from the south.

05:44.617 --> 05:47.185
Looks like they lead north
to the U.S. border.

05:50.055 --> 05:52.022
SAM:
We're looking for a wooden box

05:52.090 --> 05:54.224
roughly foot-and-a-half long,
a foot wide,

05:54.292 --> 05:55.759
about six inches high.

06:00.566 --> 06:01.399
No.

06:02.334 --> 06:04.035
Box is long gone.

06:04.103 --> 06:05.437
Drag marks.

06:05.505 --> 06:07.005
Something heavy.

06:07.073 --> 06:09.976
Case of handguns isn't worth
dragging across the desert.

06:16.284 --> 06:17.651
Got a shell casing.

06:19.420 --> 06:21.321
Choke marks.

06:21.389 --> 06:23.524
Green's got them, too.

06:23.591 --> 06:26.059
Okay, so one bike goes down.

06:26.127 --> 06:28.562
Green and Davis fight over
who's gonna be left behind.

06:28.630 --> 06:30.564
More like who's gonna
keep the box.

06:30.632 --> 06:33.967
Davis wins, then somebody
shoots him from over there.

06:34.035 --> 06:36.436
It's got to be
over 400 meters away.

06:36.504 --> 06:39.372
7.62 caliber.

06:39.440 --> 06:40.407
Shooter's no knucklehead.

06:40.474 --> 06:41.775
He knows what he's doing.

06:41.842 --> 06:43.009
These ATV tracks--

06:43.077 --> 06:44.678
they lead north, too.

06:44.746 --> 06:46.246
To the U.S. border.

06:46.314 --> 06:47.881
Okay, so what's this
all about?

06:47.949 --> 06:49.983
Whatever's inside that box.

06:50.051 --> 06:52.486
Border's four miles away.

06:52.554 --> 06:55.956
Whatever's inside that box
is already inside the country.

06:56.024 --> 06:59.526
You two follow the
shooter's ATV tracks.

07:03.999 --> 07:05.099
<i>Gracias.</i>
Okay, you know how

07:05.166 --> 07:06.500
I don't do well
over 100 degrees.

07:06.568 --> 07:07.802
I get xerosis.

07:07.869 --> 07:08.869
Deeks, that sounds
like an STD.

07:08.937 --> 07:09.870
No, no, not an STD.

07:09.938 --> 07:11.672
It's dry and scaly skin.

07:11.740 --> 07:12.907
Like a lizard.

07:12.974 --> 07:14.174
Lizards love the desert.

07:16.010 --> 07:18.645
You don't have
any sunscreen, do you?

07:18.713 --> 07:22.816
Preferably something with, like,
a moisturizer, hypo-allergenic.

07:28.288 --> 07:30.023
WOMAN:
I can't believe he's gone.

07:30.091 --> 07:32.993
We were high school
sweethearts.

07:33.061 --> 07:35.028
How long were you married
to Brandon?

07:35.096 --> 07:36.597
Three years.

07:36.664 --> 07:39.099
Had you heard from
him since he went UA?

07:39.167 --> 07:40.667
No.

07:40.735 --> 07:43.170
I told the MPs this
a hundred times already.

07:43.237 --> 07:44.571
I'm not believing it.

07:44.639 --> 07:49.343
Because he went UA,
I don't even get his pay now.

07:49.411 --> 07:51.445
Karen, Brandon's body

07:51.513 --> 07:53.314
was found with an arms dealer

07:53.381 --> 07:55.783
affiliated with several
terrorist organizations.

07:55.851 --> 07:58.853
CALLEN: We think they were
trying to smuggle

07:58.921 --> 08:00.288
something into the country.

08:00.356 --> 08:02.456
It's a matter

08:02.524 --> 08:04.458
of national security.

08:04.526 --> 08:05.993
CALLEN: You don't need to
protect him anymore.

08:06.061 --> 08:08.696
Unless you're
involved.

08:08.763 --> 08:10.298
I wasn't involved.

08:10.365 --> 08:12.166
But you do know
something.

08:18.340 --> 08:22.176
Somebody was paying Brandon
to take a box from Sudan

08:22.244 --> 08:26.347
across the ocean on a cargo ship
into Guatemala and up here.

08:26.415 --> 08:29.884
He said it was like
private security work.

08:29.952 --> 08:32.453
If you're sneaking across the
border, it's not security work.

08:32.520 --> 08:35.188
We had no money.

08:35.256 --> 08:38.159
And... I'm pregnant again.

08:38.226 --> 08:39.794
So, he said

08:39.861 --> 08:41.761
we'd never have to work
another day in our lives.

08:41.830 --> 08:44.732
For bringing one box
into the country?

08:46.768 --> 08:49.370
He said he wanted me
to be ready to leave town

08:49.438 --> 08:51.773
and not tell anybody
where I was going.

08:53.776 --> 08:56.545
Knowing Brandon,

08:56.613 --> 08:59.248
I think he was
going to steal the box

08:59.315 --> 09:01.049
when he crossed the border.

09:01.117 --> 09:02.751
Do you know what was in it?

09:04.454 --> 09:06.922
Everything we'd ever want.

09:06.990 --> 09:10.125
All our dreams.

09:11.895 --> 09:13.662
You want to share?

09:15.698 --> 09:19.201
The box was filled with gold.

09:36.428 --> 09:38.262
My cop instincts are
definitely kicking in.

09:38.330 --> 09:39.764
Yeah, what are
they telling you?

09:39.831 --> 09:41.098
Something isn't right.

09:41.166 --> 09:43.300
Wait a second.

09:44.836 --> 09:46.069
Why'd they stop
following us?

09:46.137 --> 09:47.571
Is it 'cause of the wolves?

09:47.639 --> 09:49.106
Yeah? Are there
wolves out here?

09:51.175 --> 09:52.109
(sighs)

09:52.177 --> 09:53.143
Awesome.

09:53.211 --> 09:55.179
Ever heard of the Chupacabra?
Yes.

09:55.247 --> 09:57.448
Body of a bear,
the spine of a stegosaurus,

09:57.516 --> 09:59.917
claws like an eagle, lives in
the desert, eats tourists?

09:59.985 --> 10:01.118
You are Shaggy
from <i>Scooby-Doo.</i>

10:01.186 --> 10:02.853
No, no, they call this
The Devil's Path.

10:02.921 --> 10:04.088
This area is
so dangerous,

10:04.156 --> 10:05.556
the Mexican police
don't even come here.

10:05.624 --> 10:09.560
Okay, this area, Deeks,
is the United States of America.

10:09.628 --> 10:11.128
What? We're in America?

10:11.196 --> 10:12.830
Yes! That's why
they stopped following us.

10:12.898 --> 10:14.265
The border's
right back there.

10:14.333 --> 10:16.067
Oh, well, that's
fantastic news.

10:16.134 --> 10:16.767
Oh, no!

10:16.835 --> 10:18.536
(snorting)

10:18.604 --> 10:20.437
It's a wild boar. Shh!

10:22.174 --> 10:23.274
Think it's a feral pig.

10:23.342 --> 10:25.109
No, no, no, don't
look at it directly.

10:25.177 --> 10:26.444
Show submission.

10:26.512 --> 10:28.480
Just walk away very quietly.

10:28.547 --> 10:30.182
(boar squeals)
Whoa, what the hell?

10:30.249 --> 10:32.751
Whoa.

10:32.819 --> 10:34.319
It's following you.

10:34.387 --> 10:36.788
What does he want?

10:36.856 --> 10:39.324
I think <i>she's</i> in
love with you.

10:41.093 --> 10:42.928
Oh. Well, of course she is.

10:42.995 --> 10:44.162
You want to know why?

10:44.230 --> 10:46.297
Because <i>she</i> has fantastic taste.

10:46.365 --> 10:47.632
Here, pretty girl.

10:47.700 --> 10:49.367
Huh? What's your name?

10:49.435 --> 10:50.468
You come to
the desert often?

10:50.536 --> 10:51.769
I bet you do.

10:51.837 --> 10:52.770
You keep it toned?

10:52.838 --> 10:54.472
You look good.

10:54.540 --> 10:55.539
Hey, Deeks.

10:55.607 --> 10:58.009
Think I found something.

10:58.077 --> 10:59.477
All right, you stay here.
Don't go changing.

10:59.545 --> 11:00.511
I got cop work.

11:00.579 --> 11:02.013
What do you got?

11:02.080 --> 11:04.882
ATV tracks stop here,

11:04.950 --> 11:06.985
but the truck tracks
start there.

11:07.053 --> 11:08.787
There could have been
a ramp right here.

11:08.854 --> 11:11.590
Looks like he put the ATV in
the back of a pickup truck

11:11.658 --> 11:13.425
and headed north
to the highway.

11:13.493 --> 11:15.027
DEEKS:
Hang on, baby.

11:16.229 --> 11:18.431
ERIC:
<i>¿Señor Deeks, cómo está?</i>

11:18.498 --> 11:20.733
Eric, I'm sending some pics
to my SkyDrive.

11:20.801 --> 11:23.103
<i>Bueno.</i>
See if you can I.D. the tracks.

11:23.170 --> 11:24.404
All right, pork chop,
can you describe

11:24.472 --> 11:25.839
the bad guys in the truck?

11:25.907 --> 11:27.274
Can you describe them?

11:27.342 --> 11:29.243
Uh-huh. And what about
the other one?

11:29.268 --> 11:30.187
(boar oinking)

11:30.188 --> 11:32.446
Ah, Kensi, I-I think,
I think she saw one of them.

11:32.447 --> 11:34.282
All right, got a match.

11:34.350 --> 11:38.253
BF Goodrich 245/75R17.

11:38.321 --> 11:40.955
Comes standard
on six different trucks.

11:41.023 --> 11:43.958
But only one
with dual rear wheels.

11:44.026 --> 11:46.227
Ford F-350.

11:46.295 --> 11:47.561
Eric, also take a look
at the tapes

11:47.629 --> 11:48.729
from the cameras
on Interstate 8.

11:48.796 --> 11:50.030
It's the first highway
north of here.

11:50.098 --> 11:51.264
And go back about 24 hours.

11:51.332 --> 11:52.365
Will do.

11:52.433 --> 11:53.833
Thanks.

11:53.901 --> 11:55.368
You going to put lipstick
on that pig?

11:55.436 --> 11:56.403
Don't you listen to her.

11:56.471 --> 11:57.738
She's just jealous.

11:57.806 --> 11:59.373
Don't make promises
you can't keep.

11:59.441 --> 12:01.275
I'll see you soon.
You're beautiful.

12:01.343 --> 12:03.344
I'll miss you.

12:03.412 --> 12:06.314
See, I know how
to let a girl down easy.

12:06.382 --> 12:08.050
With respect and honesty.

12:08.118 --> 12:09.786
Yeah, you change your
cell phone number.

12:09.853 --> 12:11.754
That's why I don't give them
my home address.

12:11.822 --> 12:13.123
Aha.

12:13.190 --> 12:15.058
That's why she
likes you.

12:15.126 --> 12:16.393
Why is that?

12:16.461 --> 12:18.395
Same species.

12:18.462 --> 12:20.130
SAM:
<i>You get the ballistics report</i>

12:20.197 --> 12:22.098
on the round taken
from the dead seaman?

12:22.166 --> 12:23.400
Coming in now.

12:23.468 --> 12:25.168
The ammo was a custom load.

12:25.236 --> 12:26.603
Shooter's a pro.

12:26.671 --> 12:29.373
Somebody knew the box
was coming across the border,

12:29.441 --> 12:31.609
sent the shooter
to kill the two couriers.

12:31.677 --> 12:32.877
And take the gold.

12:32.944 --> 12:34.678
Nell, how much gold
are we talking about?

12:34.746 --> 12:36.247
Well, from the
cell phone video,

12:36.315 --> 12:40.485
the box was roughly nine
by 16 inches, six inches tall.

12:40.552 --> 12:42.520
That would make it
about 300 pounds,

12:42.588 --> 12:44.623
for a value of...

12:45.992 --> 12:48.828
Looks like someone
has a secret admirer.

12:51.665 --> 12:53.867
Uh, we're somewhere
in the ballpark

12:53.934 --> 12:55.702
of eight-and-a-half
million dollars.

12:55.770 --> 12:57.070
Whoa.

12:57.138 --> 12:58.404
Arms dealer?

12:58.472 --> 13:00.172
Bringing it in
to buy more weapons?

13:00.240 --> 13:02.108
Or it could be a payment
from a sale.

13:02.176 --> 13:04.076
Why take a chance
with all that money,

13:04.144 --> 13:06.378
taking it across open desert?

13:06.446 --> 13:08.213
So, working off the
estimated time of death

13:08.281 --> 13:11.816
of Seaman Davis, there's only
one Ford F-350 with dual wheels

13:11.884 --> 13:13.118
heading west on
Interstate 8.

13:13.186 --> 13:15.387
I traced the license plate
to an auto repair shop

13:15.455 --> 13:17.256
in East L.A.,
and according to L.A...

13:18.258 --> 13:19.458
Nice flowers.

13:19.526 --> 13:21.026
Eric.

13:22.028 --> 13:23.062
Sorry.

13:23.130 --> 13:26.198
Uh, according to
LAPD, um, the shop

13:26.266 --> 13:28.868
is owned and operated
by members of the La Masa

13:28.935 --> 13:30.903
Mexican drug cartel.

13:30.971 --> 13:32.672
Address is on your phones.
Thanks, Eric.

13:37.078 --> 13:38.712
Happy birthday.

13:38.780 --> 13:40.748
Not my birthday.

13:40.816 --> 13:42.650
I actually knew that.

13:42.718 --> 13:45.754
Uh, so the flowers are for...?

13:45.821 --> 13:47.656
No occasion.

13:47.723 --> 13:51.594
So somebody sent you flowers
just because.

13:51.662 --> 13:52.895
Uh-huh.

13:52.963 --> 13:57.065
So somebody did send them.

13:57.133 --> 13:59.634
No, they just grew there.

14:00.937 --> 14:02.604
Why are you
so surprised

14:02.672 --> 14:04.372
that somebody
would send me flowers?

14:06.508 --> 14:07.975
I'm actually not surprised.

14:10.311 --> 14:11.912
At all.

14:20.989 --> 14:23.124
♪ ♪

14:23.191 --> 14:25.392
(power tools whirring
and buzzing)

14:44.012 --> 14:45.579
Shooter's truck.

14:45.647 --> 14:48.215
License matches.

14:49.484 --> 14:51.553
What do you guys want?

14:51.620 --> 14:53.422
Federal agents.

14:53.489 --> 14:55.891
We got a couple questions
about that truck.

14:55.958 --> 14:57.625
We can't answer any questions.

15:00.495 --> 15:01.562
You got a carry permit for that?

15:01.630 --> 15:02.896
Yes, I do.

15:02.964 --> 15:04.097
You just answered a question.

15:04.165 --> 15:05.632
You answer questions very well.

15:05.700 --> 15:07.333
You shouldn't
underestimate yourself.

15:07.401 --> 15:09.602
So why don't you give us
the key to that truck,

15:09.669 --> 15:11.437
or we can all wait
around here for a warrant.

15:11.505 --> 15:13.639
SAM: If that happens, who knows
what else we'll find here?

15:13.706 --> 15:15.073
CALLEN: I'm pretty sure you
know the drill.

15:15.141 --> 15:17.642
One phone call-- hour
and a half, tops.

15:17.710 --> 15:19.244
It's all done
electronically now.

15:19.312 --> 15:21.347
You'll have a dozen agents
crawling all over this place.

15:21.414 --> 15:23.115
Well, you do what
you got to do.

15:23.183 --> 15:25.183
But I'm asking you
to leave...

15:25.251 --> 15:27.219
now.

15:45.204 --> 15:46.571
They got drugs or cash
on this property,

15:46.639 --> 15:48.840
and they're not going to
want to lose it to a search.

15:48.908 --> 15:51.443
Guess they're not going
to let us drive out of here.

15:51.511 --> 15:53.912
You got them?
Yeah, I got them.

15:59.852 --> 16:01.686
(gunfire continues)

16:18.738 --> 16:20.739
(engine starts)

16:34.054 --> 16:35.855
You okay?

16:35.922 --> 16:37.189
Yeah.

16:37.257 --> 16:38.557
You?

16:39.559 --> 16:41.593
MAN: Excuse me.
Little help here.

16:48.435 --> 16:50.270
Hi.
What's your name?

16:50.337 --> 16:51.271
Jaime.

16:51.338 --> 16:52.572
I don't got a gun.

16:52.639 --> 16:53.773
You okay?

16:53.841 --> 16:55.241
I'm great.

16:55.309 --> 16:56.776
I just can't breathe.

16:58.312 --> 16:59.545
You don't realize
how heavy

16:59.613 --> 17:01.380
a car is
until you're under it, huh?

17:02.415 --> 17:04.282
Yeah, I guess not.

17:04.351 --> 17:07.185
(grunting)

17:07.253 --> 17:09.488
Clear?
Yeah.

17:09.556 --> 17:11.723
Come on.

17:15.528 --> 17:16.929
You good?
Yeah.

17:16.997 --> 17:19.031
You guys know
I wasn't shooting at you, right?

17:19.098 --> 17:20.266
For that, we thank you.

17:20.333 --> 17:21.567
Can we ask you a question?

17:21.634 --> 17:23.102
I'm not supposed to talk
to cops.

17:23.170 --> 17:24.704
Well, don't think
of us as cops.

17:24.771 --> 17:26.539
Think of us as the guys
who just saved your life.

17:26.606 --> 17:27.839
Means you
owe us, Jaime.

17:27.907 --> 17:29.308
Who owns that
red truck?

17:29.376 --> 17:30.877
My boss.

17:30.944 --> 17:32.111
Where's he?

17:32.179 --> 17:34.313
Been in Mexico
for the last week.

17:34.380 --> 17:37.315
Did you maybe lend that truck
to someone, say,

17:37.383 --> 17:38.817
day before yesterday?

17:38.884 --> 17:40.218
Come on, guys.

17:40.286 --> 17:41.719
CALLEN:
Do you have any idea

17:41.787 --> 17:45.290
how horrible it would have been
to be crushed under this truck?

17:45.357 --> 17:46.958
Your insides would
have squirted out like

17:47.025 --> 17:48.259
a broken
toothpaste tube.

17:48.327 --> 17:49.993
Who'd you lend the truck to?

17:50.061 --> 17:53.130
My boss was hired by somebody--

17:53.197 --> 17:55.732
I don't know who--
to steal some box.

17:55.800 --> 17:57.401
So he sent his guy.

17:57.468 --> 17:58.902
Name?

17:58.970 --> 18:00.604
Hey, you got to understand,

18:00.672 --> 18:02.974
nobody trusts me
with important information.

18:03.041 --> 18:04.442
And that's their mistake.

18:04.510 --> 18:06.411
They're clearly not a
good judge of character.

18:06.479 --> 18:09.881
Your boss sent
his guy who...?

18:09.949 --> 18:12.217
He does the,
you know, the...

18:12.285 --> 18:13.251
Hits for him?

18:13.319 --> 18:14.486
Yeah.

18:14.553 --> 18:17.422
So one might call him
a hit man?

18:17.489 --> 18:19.223
Yeah.

18:19.291 --> 18:22.526
He went down to the border
to kill these two guys

18:22.594 --> 18:26.497
and take the box in exchange
for half of the contents.

18:26.565 --> 18:28.266
Thank you, Jaime.

18:28.333 --> 18:30.101
Now we have to cuff you.
With handcuffs?

18:30.169 --> 18:33.538
Uh, most likely.

18:33.605 --> 18:35.473
I still owe you guys?

18:35.540 --> 18:38.342
Jaime, we saved
your life.

18:38.410 --> 18:41.278
That's a big
debt to pay.

18:41.346 --> 18:43.681
Where did your boss
hide the gold?

18:43.749 --> 18:45.850
Gold? What gold?

18:45.918 --> 18:46.952
From the box.

18:47.019 --> 18:48.687
There's no gold in the box.

18:51.056 --> 18:53.190
You remember what was in it?

18:53.258 --> 18:55.326
Of course I do.
I'm not stupid.

18:55.394 --> 18:57.930
We don't think you're stupid.

18:57.997 --> 18:59.064
Jaime,

18:59.132 --> 19:01.300
we're your biggest fans.

19:01.368 --> 19:02.969
Now, what was in the box?

19:03.037 --> 19:05.338
Brown heroin.

19:05.406 --> 19:07.441
We're a drug cartel, homes.

19:07.509 --> 19:09.276
Damn, you guys
don't know nothing!

19:11.880 --> 19:13.381
I guess we don't.

19:24.011 --> 19:26.346
So he does hits
for the cartel.

19:26.414 --> 19:28.248
Picks up the
car for the job

19:28.315 --> 19:30.617
and then he drops it back
with you at the garage.

19:30.684 --> 19:33.387
Yeah. I only saw the guy
maybe four times.

19:33.455 --> 19:35.822
CALLEN (over TV):
What's he look like?

19:35.890 --> 19:37.757
JAIME:
He looks full-on Indian.

19:37.825 --> 19:39.926
But I heard he was part Mexican.

19:39.994 --> 19:42.329
If he wasn't part Mexican,
he don't work for us.

19:42.396 --> 19:44.197
Are we even yet?

19:44.265 --> 19:45.666
Close.

19:45.733 --> 19:46.934
Is there
anything else

19:47.001 --> 19:48.502
you can tell me about him?

19:48.570 --> 19:49.504
Anything at all?

19:49.572 --> 19:52.874
Slick, dresses nice,

19:52.941 --> 19:54.743
makes very good money
killing people.

19:54.810 --> 19:57.612
There's always work
when you got skills.

19:57.680 --> 19:58.847
Truth.

19:58.915 --> 20:01.917
Jaime, I don't want
you to hurt yourself,

20:01.985 --> 20:03.886
but I want you to try

20:03.954 --> 20:06.255
really hard to think about
what he looked like.

20:08.558 --> 20:09.591
(sighs)

20:09.659 --> 20:11.026
He wore red cowboy boots.

20:11.094 --> 20:12.761
And he had these

20:12.829 --> 20:16.230
badass wristbands with
a monkey on it, held bullets.

20:16.298 --> 20:18.065
Eric, there's a shop
called Red Monkey;

20:18.133 --> 20:19.400
they do leather work for bikers

20:19.468 --> 20:20.401
and rock stars.

20:20.469 --> 20:21.969
You should check it out.

20:24.105 --> 20:25.039
(chuckles)

20:25.106 --> 20:26.540
Very low-level
encryption.

20:26.608 --> 20:28.309
Give me a minute to break it.

20:28.377 --> 20:29.777
And logo's coming

20:29.845 --> 20:31.846
to your phone.

20:34.517 --> 20:35.951
That's it.

20:36.018 --> 20:37.619
Badass, right?

20:37.687 --> 20:39.221
Badass as Matthew Broderick.

20:39.289 --> 20:40.222
(chuckles)

20:40.290 --> 20:41.324
Who's Matthew Broderick?

20:41.391 --> 20:42.925
A badass.

20:42.993 --> 20:44.361
I'm in.

20:44.428 --> 20:46.896
Looking at the Internet
sales orders for Red Monkey.

20:46.964 --> 20:49.499
Looks like the wrist bandoleros

20:49.566 --> 20:51.300
were custom orders.
Hmm.

20:51.368 --> 20:52.735
They only made three.

20:52.802 --> 20:55.738
One went to Florida,
the other to Europe...

20:55.805 --> 20:58.507
And wouldn't you know it, one
has an address in downtown L.A.

20:58.575 --> 21:00.776
Coming to your phones.

21:00.877 --> 21:03.779
You know what, Jaime,
I think we're even.

21:03.846 --> 21:06.582
My debt for you
saving my life is paid?

21:06.650 --> 21:07.416
Yep.

21:07.484 --> 21:09.351
Oh, that's great.

21:09.419 --> 21:11.320
'Cause I don't think
I know anything else.

21:11.388 --> 21:13.022
About anything.
Yeah.

21:13.090 --> 21:14.023
Thank you.

21:14.091 --> 21:15.024
Thanks.

21:15.092 --> 21:16.659
It's been real.

21:16.727 --> 21:18.829
Yeah.

21:18.896 --> 21:20.263
Hey, you guys are cool.

21:20.331 --> 21:22.332
So are you.
Huh.

21:29.273 --> 21:31.274
(doorknob rattling)

21:33.377 --> 21:35.378
Hey, guys!

21:35.446 --> 21:37.881
Little help here!

21:37.949 --> 21:39.416
So you in a thing now?

21:41.919 --> 21:44.454
Like, uh, with
another person.

21:44.522 --> 21:45.455
Like, a relationsh...

21:45.522 --> 21:47.690
<i>Don't</i> say the R word.

21:47.758 --> 21:51.059
I don't have
to be in a...

21:51.127 --> 21:53.461
In a R word.

21:53.529 --> 21:55.230
...to get flowers.

21:55.297 --> 21:56.898
No. No, of
course not.

21:56.966 --> 21:58.666
You could-- I mean,
you could get flowers

21:58.734 --> 22:00.334
for a lot of other reasons.

22:00.402 --> 22:01.736
A lot of other reasons.

22:01.804 --> 22:03.004
Like if I was...

22:03.072 --> 22:04.739
Like if you... die.

22:04.807 --> 22:06.041
There you go.

22:06.108 --> 22:08.944
Mm-hmm. Or if you
have major surgery.

22:09.012 --> 22:10.579
There's another one.

22:11.614 --> 22:13.048
Have you had major surgery?

22:13.116 --> 22:15.484
I have not.

22:15.552 --> 22:18.221
And you are clearly not dead.

22:18.288 --> 22:20.490
Well...

22:20.558 --> 22:23.693
So that, uh, leaves
the "R" word.

22:23.761 --> 22:24.928
Uh-huh.

22:24.995 --> 22:26.996
I have to go talk to Hetty.

22:38.340 --> 22:39.774
(elevator bell dings)
SAM: Wow.

22:39.842 --> 22:41.909
CALLEN: Penthouse.
Somebody's getting paid.

22:41.977 --> 22:44.078
KENSI:
Yeah. Look at this place.

23:09.307 --> 23:11.075
(kicks door)
Federal agents!

23:13.911 --> 23:15.178
I got a body.

23:15.246 --> 23:16.413
CALLEN:
Bedroom's clear.

23:16.480 --> 23:18.481
KENSI: Clear.
DEEKS: Clear.

23:21.051 --> 23:22.618
He's dead.

23:22.686 --> 23:25.053
Slightly warm.

23:25.121 --> 23:27.222
Red cowboy boots, wristbands.

23:27.289 --> 23:29.958
No obvious cause of death.

23:30.026 --> 23:33.127
Anybody else noticing
a reoccurring motif

23:33.195 --> 23:34.495
in all these paintings?

23:34.563 --> 23:36.865
KENSI:
Rifle's a 7.62 caliber.

23:36.932 --> 23:39.234
High-powered scope.

23:39.302 --> 23:41.737
Probably the weapon
that killed Brandon Davis.

23:43.072 --> 23:44.473
He's got some kind of powder
around his nose.

23:44.541 --> 23:45.908
DEEKS:
We got powder here, too.

23:45.976 --> 23:49.678
Looks like he might've
taken a taste and died happy.

23:52.716 --> 23:54.817
Eric.

23:56.820 --> 24:00.089
Eric!

24:00.156 --> 24:03.526
Comms are down--
too much steel.

24:03.594 --> 24:05.161
What's up, G?

24:06.197 --> 24:09.299
Where is the box?

24:09.367 --> 24:12.235
Couple hundred pounds--
that's like moving a safe.

24:12.303 --> 24:14.204
That's not exactly
a one-man job.

24:14.272 --> 24:15.372
Uh...

24:15.440 --> 24:17.508
somebody used a dolly.

24:17.576 --> 24:19.811
Indents lead
straight out the door.

24:24.550 --> 24:26.351
Let's check the building
security cameras.

24:30.289 --> 24:33.357
CALLEN:
That's our box.

24:33.425 --> 24:35.158
It's the same floor
as the shooter.

24:37.561 --> 24:39.229
I recognize that.
What?

24:39.296 --> 24:40.696
Can you zoom in on his face?

24:40.764 --> 24:42.732
On this guy.

24:44.067 --> 24:46.336
Sudanese tribal scars.

24:47.371 --> 24:48.838
So someone from Sudan

24:48.905 --> 24:51.641
pays Davis and Green to
bring a box into the U.S.

24:51.709 --> 24:53.176
They think it's gold.

24:53.244 --> 24:55.111
Then somebody pays
a Mexican drug gang

24:55.179 --> 24:57.714
to steal it
because it's really heroin.

24:57.782 --> 25:00.517
But then the Sudanese
steal the box back.

25:00.585 --> 25:02.386
Something's still missing here.

25:03.755 --> 25:04.922
Is this a live feed?

25:04.989 --> 25:06.890
Yeah.

25:08.426 --> 25:10.594
SAM:
He's working the lock.

25:10.662 --> 25:12.262
Could be one of the Sudanese.

25:12.330 --> 25:13.530
Maybe they're coming back.

25:13.598 --> 25:14.865
Maybe they forgot something
in the apartment.

25:18.269 --> 25:20.337
Kensi, Deeks.

25:20.404 --> 25:22.939
Comms are still down.

25:23.007 --> 25:24.574
(phone speed dialing)

25:24.642 --> 25:25.976
(elevator bell dings)

25:42.027 --> 25:44.029
(phone ringing)

25:46.432 --> 25:47.699
KENSI: Hey, Sam?

25:47.767 --> 25:49.134
Kensi, you've got company.

25:49.202 --> 25:50.169
Kensi...
Hang up.

25:50.236 --> 25:52.838
Please, don't
make a sound.

25:52.906 --> 25:55.474
DEEKS: Are you digging the art
in this place as much as I am?

25:55.542 --> 25:58.277
I mean, it's bold,
and it's cool.

25:58.345 --> 26:00.279
I mean, why isn't there
more cool art, you know?

26:00.347 --> 26:02.415
Oh, there's another one.
I want to show you this one.

26:02.483 --> 26:03.816
This is my favorite

26:03.884 --> 26:06.518
'cause it's the perfect
combination of girls and guns.

26:08.855 --> 26:10.189
Let me make this
perfectly clear:

26:10.256 --> 26:11.523
If you harm her,

26:11.591 --> 26:13.159
this is going to be
your last day on earth.

26:13.226 --> 26:14.693
Who are you?

26:14.761 --> 26:16.228
SAM:
Federal agents.

26:16.296 --> 26:18.297
Drop your weapon.

26:18.365 --> 26:20.599
Agent Sam Hanna.

26:20.667 --> 26:21.967
SAM:
Turn around,

26:22.035 --> 26:24.002
slowly.

26:26.673 --> 26:28.341
(laughs)

26:28.409 --> 26:30.477
(chuckles)

26:30.545 --> 26:32.179
SAM:
Michael.

26:36.051 --> 26:38.086
So this is Michael Saleh?

26:38.153 --> 26:39.287
Nice to finally
meet you.

26:39.355 --> 26:40.855
And you, too,
Agent G. Callen.

26:40.923 --> 26:42.257
You know what this is?
This is warm and cuddly,

26:42.324 --> 26:44.392
but we're forgetting he nearly
just killed my partner.

26:44.460 --> 26:48.229
Meet CIA Operations Officer
Michael Saleh.

26:48.297 --> 26:50.431
Wish I could say
it was a pleasure.

26:50.499 --> 26:51.598
Sorry about that.

26:51.666 --> 26:54.635
Wait, and you guys
know each other how?

26:54.702 --> 26:56.069
Michael and I have been working
undercover in Sudan

26:56.137 --> 26:58.338
on the CIA task force
for over a year.

26:58.405 --> 26:59.539
Over a year?

26:59.607 --> 27:01.307
DEEKS:
Oh, so that's what those

27:01.375 --> 27:02.608
long-weekend dive trips were.

27:02.676 --> 27:04.610
When you went to Cancun
with my SEAL buddies.

27:04.678 --> 27:06.146
It actually makes me feel
a lot better,

27:06.213 --> 27:07.347
knowing why I wasn't invited.

27:07.415 --> 27:08.982
That's not why
you weren't invited.

27:09.050 --> 27:10.317
Uh, uh, don't speak
'cause right now

27:10.385 --> 27:12.052
I'm feeling really good
about our friendship.

27:12.119 --> 27:14.388
So... this is Deeks?

27:14.456 --> 27:16.123
DEEKS: What? Yeah, yeah,
this is...

27:16.191 --> 27:17.258
Wait, what did he tell you
about me?

27:17.326 --> 27:18.459
Nothing.
No, come on.

27:18.527 --> 27:20.528
Well, he once mentioned
something

27:20.596 --> 27:22.164
about falling in
the canal in Venice.

27:22.231 --> 27:24.567
(laughs): The cana... the canal.
That was...

27:24.634 --> 27:25.768
You remember that.

27:25.836 --> 27:27.036
That was a good time.
Yeah.

27:27.104 --> 27:28.871
Phew.
Good time.

27:28.938 --> 27:33.042
I've been tracking this box
since it left the Sudan,

27:33.109 --> 27:34.576
into Guatemala
and into Mexico.

27:35.612 --> 27:36.879
They kill him?

27:36.947 --> 27:39.548
My guess is,
he snorted the heroin.

27:39.616 --> 27:40.783
He snorted it?

27:41.585 --> 27:44.319
There was no heroin in that box.

27:44.387 --> 27:46.455
So, what was in it, then?

27:48.759 --> 27:51.994
He died
from radiation poisoning.

27:52.061 --> 27:53.262
The box wasn't filled

27:53.329 --> 27:55.097
with gold or heroin.

27:55.165 --> 27:58.034
The box was filled with uranium.

28:15.362 --> 28:18.064
Sudan contains the third-largest
supply of uranium in the world.

28:18.132 --> 28:20.799
The uranium ore
was shipped from Sudan

28:20.867 --> 28:23.969
to Iran, and returned to the
Sudan in a highly refined state.

28:24.037 --> 28:25.671
Looks like powder-- that's why
the shooter snorted it.

28:25.739 --> 28:27.072
CALLEN:
So al-Qaeda hired others

28:27.140 --> 28:28.675
to transport
the uranium-filled box

28:28.742 --> 28:30.977
because constant exposure
to the uranium will kill you.

28:31.044 --> 28:33.379
Everybody that gets
close to it dies?

28:33.447 --> 28:35.481
No, they were carrying it close
to their bodies for weeks;

28:35.549 --> 28:37.951
short-term exposures
won't hurt you.

28:38.018 --> 28:39.953
Everybody was told there was
something else in the box.

28:40.020 --> 28:42.889
Their greed motivating them
down the garden path.

28:42.957 --> 28:44.891
You recognize any of these guys

28:44.959 --> 28:46.259
from the elevator
surveillance tape?

28:46.327 --> 28:47.827
They stole the box
from the shooter's apartment.

28:47.895 --> 28:50.196
No. They don't look like

28:50.264 --> 28:52.232
any known al-Qaeda operatives
from the Sudan.

28:52.300 --> 28:53.934
SAM: They could've come to the U.S.
years ago.

28:54.002 --> 28:57.138
They may have green cards
and citizenship by now.

28:57.206 --> 28:59.507
So, what are we looking at here,
a dirty bomb?

28:59.575 --> 29:01.075
From the residue on the table
I don't think so.

29:01.143 --> 29:02.677
The powder was too fine,

29:02.744 --> 29:04.746
the dispersal pattern
would be small.

29:04.813 --> 29:05.947
Then what's it for?

29:10.419 --> 29:12.787
Oh, look at that.

29:12.855 --> 29:14.456
Oh, yeah. A little-little gift.

29:14.523 --> 29:15.790
Hmm.

29:15.858 --> 29:18.460
Did you have a surgical
procedure in the last hour?

29:18.527 --> 29:19.794
Uh, no.

29:19.862 --> 29:22.364
And I am not dead,
in case you were wondering.

29:22.432 --> 29:23.998
See, 'cause that's funny

29:24.066 --> 29:27.002
that we both got flowers
on the same day.

29:27.069 --> 29:29.171
It's odd, isn't it?

29:29.239 --> 29:30.172
It's a real coincidence.

29:30.240 --> 29:31.340
It's weird.

29:31.408 --> 29:32.675
It's very weird.
Mm-hmm.

29:32.743 --> 29:34.310
You might say.

29:39.249 --> 29:41.917
(sighs heavily)

29:41.985 --> 29:45.321
Okay, I sent the flowers
to myself.

29:46.357 --> 29:47.691
Oh.

29:48.726 --> 29:50.093
I really like flowers,

29:50.160 --> 29:52.362
and no one has sent them
to me in a long time,

29:52.429 --> 29:54.030
so I sent them to myself.

29:54.097 --> 29:56.632
(relieved laugh)
That's great.

29:56.700 --> 29:58.400
Why is that great?

29:58.468 --> 29:59.568
No, it's not great.

29:59.636 --> 30:01.103
It's, um...

30:01.171 --> 30:05.508
it's sad... it's sad that you
sent them to yourself.

30:05.575 --> 30:07.376
Like you did?

30:07.444 --> 30:08.711
I...

30:08.778 --> 30:10.679
I didn't send
anything to my...

30:10.747 --> 30:12.815
I don't...
Okay.

30:12.882 --> 30:14.950
Okay...

30:15.018 --> 30:17.520
I gave the flower to myself.

30:17.588 --> 30:19.455
I'm shocked.

30:19.523 --> 30:22.591
I mean, I know why I sent
the flowers to myself,

30:22.659 --> 30:26.428
so... what's your excuse?

30:26.496 --> 30:29.698
When I saw that someone else
had given you flowers, I...

30:29.766 --> 30:31.166
I-I felt...

30:31.234 --> 30:32.401
um...

30:32.468 --> 30:34.235
Competitive?

30:34.303 --> 30:36.270
Competitive.
I felt competitive.

30:36.338 --> 30:37.472
Competitive with you.

30:37.539 --> 30:39.040
That's a good word for it.

30:39.107 --> 30:43.710
So, I took the flower
from Hetty's desk.

30:43.778 --> 30:45.379
You took a flower
from Hetty's desk.

30:45.446 --> 30:46.780
Yeah.

30:46.848 --> 30:48.782
She cuts them herself.
It's a big bunch.

30:48.850 --> 30:50.250
Hetty will never miss it.

30:50.318 --> 30:52.085
Hm-hmm.

30:54.122 --> 30:55.989
I'm doomed, aren't I?

30:58.693 --> 31:03.966
You sacrificed yourself
to compete with me.

31:07.304 --> 31:08.537
(computer bleeping)

31:08.605 --> 31:09.772
Facial-recognition

31:09.840 --> 31:11.741
got a hit on one of the guys
from the elevator.

31:11.809 --> 31:14.277
He's got
a Sudanese passport.

31:14.344 --> 31:16.045
Samir Abbas.

31:16.113 --> 31:18.714
Samir Abbas.

31:18.782 --> 31:21.050
I have a home address
and work address.

31:21.118 --> 31:23.553
Currently working
at Anderson & Kirk's

31:23.621 --> 31:26.322
Technical Services.

31:26.390 --> 31:28.657
So, what's going on?

31:28.725 --> 31:31.427
I'm pretty sure my cover
in the Sudan was compromised.

31:32.462 --> 31:34.930
How?

31:34.998 --> 31:37.466
There may be a leak
inside the agency.

31:37.534 --> 31:38.767
Any idea who?

31:38.835 --> 31:40.402
I don't know.

31:40.503 --> 31:43.805
You're not CIA...

31:43.872 --> 31:45.773
I believe your cover
is still safe.

31:45.841 --> 31:48.475
But I can't go back
to the Sudan.

31:48.543 --> 31:50.311
Of course not.

31:50.379 --> 31:52.747
It means

31:52.815 --> 31:54.282
when you return,

31:54.350 --> 31:58.187
you're going to be
on your own there.

31:58.255 --> 32:00.256
Sorry.

32:02.626 --> 32:05.862
I think it may be time for me
to get out of the field anyway.

32:07.899 --> 32:09.866
I'm sure your wife
would appreciate it.

32:09.934 --> 32:11.601
Oh, more than you know.

32:11.668 --> 32:13.836
Oh, believe me, I know.

32:13.904 --> 32:15.271
(chuckling)

32:15.338 --> 32:16.905
Eric found one of them.

32:21.611 --> 32:24.246
CALLEN:
Kensi, Deeks, take the back.

32:25.848 --> 32:27.715
Federal agents.

32:27.783 --> 32:29.684
We're looking for this man--
Samir Abbas.

32:29.752 --> 32:30.685
He works here.

32:30.753 --> 32:31.987
I got him.

32:34.557 --> 32:36.325
Federal agents! Freeze!

32:39.463 --> 32:41.164
Both hands where I can see them.

32:42.933 --> 32:43.900
Both hands!

32:43.968 --> 32:45.602
(rapid gunfire)

32:52.376 --> 32:53.609
KENSI:
Clear.

32:55.045 --> 32:56.878
DEEKS:
Ah, that was noisy.

33:02.584 --> 33:04.518
It's the uranium.

33:04.586 --> 33:06.720
There should be a lot more
than this.

33:07.822 --> 33:08.788
Where's the rest?

33:08.856 --> 33:10.089
What is this place?

33:10.157 --> 33:11.358
What do you do here?

33:11.425 --> 33:13.059
We service large
air-conditioning systems.

33:13.127 --> 33:15.729
They're building an RDD.

33:15.796 --> 33:18.231
A what?
A Radiation Dispersal Device.

33:18.299 --> 33:19.950
The uranium has been processed
to a fine powder.

33:20.159 --> 33:22.076
They're gonna put it in an
air-conditioning system somewhere.

33:22.303 --> 33:23.570
Thousands of people
could ingest it

33:23.637 --> 33:24.938
before anyone even knew
it was there.

33:25.006 --> 33:26.440
It could render
buildings uninhabitable

33:26.507 --> 33:27.774
for a millennia.

33:27.841 --> 33:30.376
The CIA calls it
real estate acquisition.

33:30.444 --> 33:33.045
It's 9/11 without knocking down
buildings.

33:33.113 --> 33:35.781
SAM: There's still two guys out there
with the uranium.

33:35.849 --> 33:37.249
The attacks are going down
right now.

33:37.317 --> 33:39.652
But where?

33:49.416 --> 33:51.217
37 air-conditioning companies

33:51.285 --> 33:53.853
that are big enough
to handle large structures.

33:53.921 --> 33:55.455
2,500 employees.

33:55.522 --> 33:58.859
Bringing up the
company's ID photos.

33:58.926 --> 34:01.595
Running facial-rec now.

34:01.662 --> 34:03.663
Got one.

34:03.731 --> 34:05.131
Oh, actually, I got two.

34:05.199 --> 34:08.801
All right,
Saif Molla and Hafiz Hussein.

34:08.869 --> 34:10.168
Chapman Point Heating and Air.

34:10.237 --> 34:12.606
- Address?
ERIC: On your cell now.

34:12.672 --> 34:14.408
I'm going to try to get into
the company's cameras,

34:14.475 --> 34:16.109
see if I can find Hafiz Hussein

34:16.177 --> 34:19.012
and Saif Molla.
Okay,

34:19.080 --> 34:20.414
I'll check their work schedules.

34:25.353 --> 34:26.620
Sam, according to
the work schedule,

34:26.688 --> 34:29.456
Saif Molla and Hafiz Hussein
are at work right now.

34:29.524 --> 34:31.525
(engine revving,
tires screeching)

34:35.464 --> 34:37.063
I cannot find
Molla or Hussein

34:37.132 --> 34:38.632
on any of
the company's cameras.

34:38.699 --> 34:40.434
I don't think
they're there.

34:42.571 --> 34:45.172
They're not there 'cause Molla
and Hussein have a work order.

34:45.239 --> 34:46.873
ERIC: Molla and Hussein
are not in the building.

34:46.942 --> 34:48.543
They're out on a job site.

34:48.610 --> 34:50.011
Where?

34:50.078 --> 34:52.580
Looks like they're taking
some old units to be recycled.

34:52.648 --> 34:54.348
That's clearly not the target.

34:54.416 --> 34:56.917
It's going to be somewhere big,
somewhere public.

34:56.985 --> 34:58.218
(bleeping)

34:58.286 --> 34:58.352
Okay, got the last one.

35:00.422 --> 35:02.222
Jonathan Debaki,

35:02.289 --> 35:03.924
Lamont Heating
and Air-Conditioning.

35:03.991 --> 35:05.291
DEEKS:
Got it.

35:05.359 --> 35:06.559
(tires squealing)

35:08.028 --> 35:09.628
That's him.
That's Debaki.

35:11.431 --> 35:12.598
Federal agents!

35:13.800 --> 35:14.900
Don't do it!

35:14.968 --> 35:17.170
Freeze! Hands against the truck.

35:30.586 --> 35:32.454
He's got the uranium.

35:33.489 --> 35:34.756
Where were you going?

35:34.824 --> 35:37.125
Huh? Where's the target?

35:37.193 --> 35:39.694
DEBAKI: I don't know what
you're talking about.

35:39.762 --> 35:40.929
Callen, Sam,

35:40.996 --> 35:42.897
they're targeting
the Convention Center.

35:44.466 --> 35:46.967
Get me LAPD-- they need
to evacuate the building.

35:47.035 --> 35:48.835
LA Gamer Expo
going on right now.

35:48.903 --> 35:51.137
There's 30,000 people
in there.

35:54.675 --> 35:57.443
MAN (over P.A.): Remain calm
and please exit the building.

35:57.511 --> 35:59.378
(sirens wailing,
panicked shouting)

35:59.446 --> 36:03.148
MAN (over P.A.): Remain calm
and please exit the building.

36:05.151 --> 36:08.688
MAN (over P.A.): Remain calm
and please exit the building.

36:08.755 --> 36:13.126
CALLEN: Eric, check the schematics
and get me to the AC system.

36:13.194 --> 36:15.595
You need to get to the other
side of the main lobby.

36:15.663 --> 36:19.400
MAN (over P.A.): Remain calm
and please exit the building.

36:21.336 --> 36:24.204
MAN (over P.A.): Remain calm
and please exit the building.

36:26.708 --> 36:28.842
ERIC:
Keep going straight ahead.

36:31.246 --> 36:34.581
MAN (over P.A.): Remain calm
and please exit the building.

36:34.649 --> 36:36.550
Go down the stairs
directly in front of you.

36:41.589 --> 36:43.523
ERIC:
Halfway down the hallway,

36:43.591 --> 36:44.958
there's a door on your left.

36:45.026 --> 36:46.826
That leads
to the maintenance area.

36:46.894 --> 36:49.195
Federal agents! Freeze!

36:53.200 --> 36:54.567
CALLEN:
I got him!

37:56.095 --> 37:58.430
(grunts and groans)

37:59.632 --> 38:01.400
SAM:
Drop it.

38:02.802 --> 38:04.402
I said drop it.

38:08.941 --> 38:09.974
Praise Allah!

38:12.510 --> 38:15.913
Sam, stay back!

38:17.515 --> 38:20.584
Stay back.

38:24.656 --> 38:26.189
We're going to get you
to a hospital.

38:26.257 --> 38:31.628
Eric, I need an ambulance and a
radiological decon team, fast.

38:31.696 --> 38:34.398
Sam, it's in the air;
you shouldn't stay here.

38:34.466 --> 38:36.467
There's no point, my friend.

38:36.534 --> 38:38.102
There's no point. Go.

38:38.169 --> 38:39.303
Please, Sam.

38:39.370 --> 38:41.071
Stay here.

38:41.139 --> 38:43.173
(softly):
Stay here.

38:54.119 --> 38:55.620
Federal agent!

38:55.688 --> 38:58.557
Step out where
I can see you!

38:58.624 --> 38:59.524
Don't do it!

39:08.234 --> 39:10.069
G.
Clear.

39:11.939 --> 39:15.041
Where's Saleh?

39:23.318 --> 39:25.919
I should've
stayed with him.

39:36.464 --> 39:38.199
I'm sorry.

39:43.940 --> 39:45.374
Any idea where he went?

39:45.441 --> 39:48.010
I picked him up on a camera

39:48.078 --> 39:51.047
exiting the building, but...
then he disappeared.

39:51.115 --> 39:52.616
How long does he have left?

39:52.684 --> 39:55.252
Maybe a few months.

39:55.320 --> 39:57.821
Depends on how much
uranium he's ingested.

39:57.889 --> 40:01.993
Saleh is
a trained CIA operative.

40:02.060 --> 40:03.561
If he doesn't want us
to find him...

40:03.629 --> 40:06.531
Michael has a wife
and a seven-month-old baby.

40:06.598 --> 40:07.999
He might've gone
to be with them.

40:08.067 --> 40:10.401
HETTY: I just spoke with a friend
at the Agency.

40:10.469 --> 40:12.904
The CIA made sure

40:12.971 --> 40:16.240
Saleh was decontaminated,
as best they could.

40:16.308 --> 40:18.042
So where is he now?

40:18.110 --> 40:21.212
He didn't want his wife
and child to watch him die,

40:21.280 --> 40:23.181
so he's returned
to Sudan

40:23.248 --> 40:25.983
to continue his
work with the CIA.

40:26.051 --> 40:27.785
He thought he was compromised.

40:29.288 --> 40:30.722
It's not safe for him there.

40:30.789 --> 40:32.857
It doesn't matter anymore.

40:32.925 --> 40:34.625
CALLEN:
He's using

40:34.693 --> 40:38.330
what little life he has left
to defend the United States.

40:41.534 --> 40:43.935
Then I'm going there, too,
Hetty.

40:44.003 --> 40:45.570
Of course
you are, Sam.

40:45.638 --> 40:49.108
There's a Gulfstream Five
fueling and preparing

40:49.175 --> 40:53.312
to take you to the Naval Air Station
in Sigonella, Italy.

40:53.380 --> 40:54.847
From there,

40:54.915 --> 40:57.751
transport will be arranged
to take you to Sudan.

41:10.901 --> 41:12.835
You know I should
be with him.

41:12.903 --> 41:16.205
For now, it's a CIA task force.

41:19.609 --> 41:22.077
I don't have to tell you
to be ready.

41:23.112 --> 41:25.480
No, you don't.
(sighs)

41:25.548 --> 41:27.849
Of course not.

41:48.271 --> 41:52.271
== sync, corrected by <font color=#00ff00>elderman</font> ==

41:56.212 --> 41:58.614
HETTY:
Mr. Beale?

42:02.852 --> 42:04.253
Huh?

42:04.321 --> 42:08.357
HETTY: <i>I don't like it</i>
<i>when you touch my flowers.</i>
