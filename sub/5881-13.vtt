WEBVTT

00:38.080 --> 00:40.998
I like this for the powder room ,
but definitely not the bedroom .

00:41.083 --> 00:42.208
It's a little busy.

00:42.292 --> 00:43.751
I'm not sure.

00:43.836 --> 00:46.212
It's not the curtains
I'm worried about, but the cabinets.

00:46.296 --> 00:48.923
Nixon didn't stand a chance.

00:49.007 --> 00:53.219
The Browns trounced
the Redskins, 3 1 -1 0.

00:53.303 --> 00:54.929
The result of that last home game

00:55.013 --> 00:58.599
has correctly predicted
the last six elections.

00:58.684 --> 01:01.561
I wish someone would have told me that.

01:01.645 --> 01:05.648
Of course, it's really
a 50/50 chance of being right.

01:09.695 --> 01:15.366
I want to treat you like a son because. . .
I feel that way towards you .

01:15.451 --> 01:17.618
Okay.

01:17.703 --> 01:20.955
Trudy told us that you
were up for a promotion

01:21.039 --> 01:22.999
and you didn't get it or something .

01:23.083 --> 01:24.709
I wish she hadn't.

01:24.793 --> 01:27.420
Now, she loves you .

01:27.504 --> 01:28.963
And honestly,

01:29.047 --> 01:31.966
I think you need
to take a little focus off your work.

01:32.050 --> 01:35.219
This from one of the top
salesmen at Vicks Chemical .

01:35.304 --> 01:36.721
When you started talking

01:36.805 --> 01:38.973
about that Clearasil
company you bought--

01:39.057 --> 01:40.725
Now, that was kind of
worth bragging about.

01:40.809 --> 01:43.186
Did you know that there's a surge
in adolescence right now?

01:43.270 --> 01:47.356
I'll tell you , Sterling Cooper
and yours truly

01:47.441 --> 01:49.984
would love to help you
deliver that message.

01:50.068 --> 01:52.195
See? Now that's what I'm talking about.

01:52.279 --> 01:54.071
The only family and business
you should be mixing

01:54.156 --> 01:56.783
is the production of a child .

01:56.867 --> 01:58.910
And what did Trudy say about that?

01:58.994 --> 01:59.994
About what?

02:00.078 --> 02:03.998
Tom , loose lips sink ships.

02:04.082 --> 02:06.000
I was just saying that work
isn't everything , you know.

02:06.084 --> 02:09.504
It's like that song says:
um , tend your own garden .

02:09.588 --> 02:11.172
What song is that, Daddy?

02:11.256 --> 02:12.256
Uh , I don't know.

02:12.341 --> 02:13.341
People say it. It's true.

02:13.425 --> 02:14.425
It is true.

02:14.510 --> 02:15.843
Yeah . Tend to your own garden .

02:15.928 --> 02:20.014
That means. . .you know,
start growing things.

02:20.098 --> 02:21.516
Daddy!

02:21.600 --> 02:22.934
You're embarrassing us.

02:23.018 --> 02:25.102
It'll be the best Christmas present
this one ever had .

02:25.187 --> 02:27.104
And hell , Thanksgiving's Thursday.

02:33.195 --> 02:38.032
Oh, and I guess I should go to Keppler Farm
to get some acorn squash .

02:38.116 --> 02:40.326
What am I doing?
They have squash there.

02:40.410 --> 02:42.328
ery good squash , actually.

02:46.124 --> 02:48.543
I wish you would come.

02:48.627 --> 02:51.212
Birdie, I'm a partner.

02:51.296 --> 02:54.006
80% of my business
rolls out next week.

02:54.091 --> 02:55.091
It just seems silly for me

02:55.175 --> 02:58.386
to go down there
for a 1 2-hour Thanksgiving.

02:58.470 --> 03:03.724
What about, . .Sally and Bobby's
childhood memories?

03:05.519 --> 03:08.563
There was no reason
you couldn't have it up here.

03:08.647 --> 03:10.565
You know my brother's
children are animals.

03:10.649 --> 03:12.066
They can't make the trip up here,

03:12.150 --> 03:14.610
and I don't want my dad to be alone.

03:15.195 --> 03:20.783
I'll take a cab to the train,
and William will pick us up,

03:20.868 --> 03:23.160
probably in some new car.

03:28.333 --> 03:29.959
You know what? I--

03:31.211 --> 03:33.379
I don't think you want to go.

03:35.173 --> 03:37.341
I'm sorry. Was I unclear about that?

03:43.181 --> 03:44.473
I don't understand

03:44.558 --> 03:47.184
why you can't make
my family your family.

03:55.903 --> 03:58.362
Ken is perfectly happy to have me here.

04:00.699 --> 04:04.869
What do you think it's like?
He's a bachelor. It's dirty.

04:04.953 --> 04:06.787
I'm not complaining .

04:09.249 --> 04:12.585
I don't think it's a good idea
to spend money on a hotel right now.

04:12.669 --> 04:15.671
If you're so worried about my well-being,
let me come home.

04:18.550 --> 04:20.217
That's not what I meant.

04:22.471 --> 04:25.222
I mean , I know how it sounded .

04:28.727 --> 04:30.227
Jennifer.

04:41.990 --> 04:43.157
Yes.

04:43.241 --> 04:46.077
I'll quit if you let me come home.

04:50.374 --> 04:52.166
I miss you . . .

04:53.251 --> 04:55.127
so much .

05:08.308 --> 05:11.227
Those the legendary
secret files of Bert Cooper?

05:11.311 --> 05:12.520
No.

05:12.604 --> 05:15.731
I got a call from Abraham Menken .

05:15.816 --> 05:17.858
I'm sure you know
that his daughter will be unavailable

05:17.943 --> 05:19.193
for the next three months,

05:19.277 --> 05:24.448
taking some sort of ocean voyage
to Paris and whatnot.

05:24.533 --> 05:26.325
I hadn't heard that.

05:29.204 --> 05:30.287
But otherwise?

05:30.372 --> 05:32.456
There is no otherwise.

05:32.541 --> 05:37.128
Why is this man calling me?

05:37.212 --> 05:40.131
I don't know. Is he unhappy?

05:40.215 --> 05:43.384
As a partner, I do not expect
your personal preferences

05:43.468 --> 05:45.469
to interfere with our business.

05:45.554 --> 05:47.346
Who says they have?

05:47.431 --> 05:49.223
It was the tone of his voice.

05:49.307 --> 05:50.516
He's her father.

05:50.600 --> 05:52.309
That's it, cowboy.

06:01.445 --> 06:02.445
Francine.

06:02.529 --> 06:05.531
I'm coming in . I'm freezing .

06:07.868 --> 06:09.410
You're in your slippers.

06:09.494 --> 06:11.245
I've been outside
waiting for you to come home,

06:11.329 --> 06:14.248
just sitting in the car
hoping no one would see me.

06:14.332 --> 06:15.708
What's going on?

06:15.792 --> 06:17.251
Are your kids home?

06:17.335 --> 06:19.462
No. What happened?

06:20.839 --> 06:22.506
I'm so stupid .

06:23.675 --> 06:25.551
So damn stupid .

06:26.678 --> 06:29.555
You're not, Francine.

06:29.639 --> 06:32.641
Whatever happened , you're not stupid .

06:32.726 --> 06:36.270
My mind hasn't been so sharp
since I had the baby.

06:36.354 --> 06:38.022
And Carlton gave me a stack of mail,

06:38.106 --> 06:40.524
and honestly I think I just threw it away.

06:40.609 --> 06:42.276
And four days later,
the phone was cut off,

06:42.360 --> 06:47.281
so I had to go to the phone company
and pay it, or, you know, he'd have a fit.

06:47.365 --> 06:50.242
And I had to do all this
without him knowing .

06:50.327 --> 06:51.744
How perfect.

06:54.247 --> 06:57.291
I don't understand .

06:57.375 --> 06:58.876
They gave me the bill .

07:01.838 --> 07:05.299
It was close to $ 1 8.

07:05.383 --> 07:07.343
There were all these calls:

07:07.427 --> 07:10.346
long distance, M H .

07:10.430 --> 07:12.973
M H? Manhattan?

07:15.936 --> 07:17.520
So I called one.

07:19.397 --> 07:22.316
A woman answered .

07:22.400 --> 07:24.693
I had just--

07:24.778 --> 07:28.572
I said , "I'm calling
from Carlton Hanson's office."

07:28.657 --> 07:30.324
She said , "Really?"

07:30.408 --> 07:34.495
I said, "He wants to have dinner
tonight at the usual place."

07:34.579 --> 07:36.413
What made you say that?

07:42.379 --> 07:46.841
What woman would he
be calling in Manhattan

07:46.925 --> 07:49.426
who answers her own phone?

07:51.429 --> 07:53.013
Married women .

07:53.098 --> 07:56.392
Lots of women answer
their own phones.

07:56.476 --> 07:59.770
So he's calling some married woman
from my house

07:59.855 --> 08:03.065
while I'm upstairs sleeping?

08:03.150 --> 08:05.359
Maybe it's a caterer.

08:05.443 --> 08:08.279
Maybe he's throwing you
a surprise party.

08:13.493 --> 08:18.372
Do you know he spends
two nights a week at the Waldorf?

08:18.456 --> 08:21.375
I'm so stupid .

08:21.459 --> 08:23.377
Assuming the worst--

08:25.213 --> 08:28.215
The worst is that I'll poison him .

08:28.300 --> 08:31.051
He's so stupid, he'd drink anything .

08:34.014 --> 08:37.349
I'm going to have
a house full of people.

08:37.434 --> 08:39.018
I'll poison them all:

08:39.102 --> 08:43.480
his parents, my parents. . .

08:43.565 --> 08:44.815
my kids.

08:44.900 --> 08:46.400
Stop it.

08:46.484 --> 08:48.652
Stop that, Francine.

08:50.113 --> 08:52.406
You're emotional. It doesn't mean--

08:52.490 --> 08:55.618
Damn it, Betty. I know everything .

08:55.702 --> 08:57.411
What am I going to do?

08:57.495 --> 08:59.788
I've been sitting outside in the car.

08:59.873 --> 09:02.499
What do I do? I thought
you'd know what to do.

09:04.336 --> 09:07.171
Me? I-- Why?

09:10.508 --> 09:12.509
I don't know.

09:22.312 --> 09:24.063
I'm s--

09:24.147 --> 09:26.523
so embarrassed .

09:29.527 --> 09:31.445
He doesn't know you know.

09:31.529 --> 09:32.905
I know that.

09:35.825 --> 09:36.867
Go on upstairs.

09:36.952 --> 09:38.452
I should go.

09:38.536 --> 09:40.913
Come on, Bobby,
let's go play in my room .

09:40.997 --> 09:43.082
No. Don't.

09:43.166 --> 09:45.251
It'll be okay.

09:45.335 --> 09:48.003
Mrs. Draper, sorry I'm late.

09:48.088 --> 09:51.131
Oh . It's okay, Carla. You can go.

09:51.216 --> 09:52.591
You want me to unpack the groceries?

09:52.676 --> 09:55.094
I'll do it. Just go.

09:55.178 --> 09:56.971
Good-bye.

10:47.439 --> 10:48.522
First things first.

10:48.606 --> 10:50.065
When I call a meeting,

10:50.150 --> 10:52.609
if you arrive after me, you are late.

10:54.029 --> 10:56.155
Boys, the stock in our stable:

10:56.239 --> 10:59.658
Lucky Strike, Bethlehem Steel, Maytag .

10:59.743 --> 11:03.370
No automobile, airline,
pharmaceuticals.

11:03.455 --> 11:05.998
Tobacco is on that list.

11:06.082 --> 11:07.583
You're Cosgrove, right?

11:07.667 --> 11:11.587
The powerhouse
behind the Rejuvenator?

11:11.671 --> 11:15.382
Actually, it's called
the Relax-a-Cizor now.

11:15.467 --> 11:16.675
What the hell is it?

11:16.760 --> 11:20.554
It's a weight loss device
with a female pleasure payload .

11:21.639 --> 11:22.639
Really?

11:23.933 --> 11:25.559
I'm offering a hundred-dollar bonus

11:25.643 --> 11:29.563
to the first man who brings me
a meeting with a decision maker.

11:29.647 --> 11:33.567
Gentlemen, here's a list of people
you should be having lunch with.

11:33.651 --> 11:36.612
I want you to run into people,
go through old yearbooks.

11:36.696 --> 11:39.698
This means everybody. Writers, too.

11:39.783 --> 11:41.325
Bringing in business is the key

11:41.409 --> 11:44.036
to your salary, your status,
and your self-worth.

11:44.120 --> 11:45.662
I went to the Athletic Club today,

11:45.747 --> 11:48.582
and I sat in the steam
for an hour and a half.

11:48.666 --> 11:50.376
In that time, I lost 4 pounds

11:50.460 --> 11:52.169
and learned that Kodak still isn't happy

11:52.253 --> 11:54.171
with the campaign
for the new slide projector.

11:54.255 --> 11:56.632
Is any of this sinking in?

12:00.678 --> 12:03.597
"It's true that while simply relaxing ,

12:03.681 --> 12:06.600
"I can get all the benefits
of calisthenics.

12:06.684 --> 12:10.020
"A simple regimen of three
20-minute sessions per week,

12:10.105 --> 12:11.897
"combined with a sensible diet,

12:11.981 --> 12:14.191
"will restore your youthful glow.

12:14.275 --> 12:17.027
"I love the way it makes me feel .

12:17.112 --> 12:18.612
"The Relax-a-Cizor.

12:18.696 --> 12:20.697
It's my little secret."

12:22.283 --> 12:24.618
Thank you , Annie.

12:24.702 --> 12:28.330
Uh, one more time. . . Rita.

12:29.624 --> 12:31.625
"I never thought it would happen to me,

12:31.709 --> 12:34.586
"but I regained my youth
and my happiness.

12:34.671 --> 12:36.422
- Just ask my husband ."
- Todd?

12:36.506 --> 12:38.590
I think we're both going
to agree on Annie.

12:38.675 --> 12:39.883
Which one is Annie?

12:41.553 --> 12:43.637
Believe it or not, I like Rita.

12:43.721 --> 12:47.391
She's got that voice:
randy and knowing ,

12:47.475 --> 12:48.767
like the Relax-a-Cizor.

12:48.852 --> 12:52.521
Annie belongs on TV
with Rita's voice dubbed in .

12:55.066 --> 12:56.150
Norma, thank you .

12:56.234 --> 12:57.317
You can go.

12:59.737 --> 13:00.904
Whatever the--

13:00.989 --> 13:04.491
special properties
of the Relax-a-Cizor are,

13:04.576 --> 13:08.787
what we are selling is confidence,
a better you .

13:08.872 --> 13:10.664
That woman isn't a better anything .

13:10.748 --> 13:16.211
Annie is a confident, beautiful woman,
and you can hear it in her voice.

13:16.296 --> 13:18.672
I can't believe I'm in this argument.

13:18.756 --> 13:20.674
Sorry about that, Rita.

13:20.758 --> 13:22.676
Hi, Annie. We'll do this tomorrow.

13:22.760 --> 13:24.219
Check with Peggy here
for your session .

13:27.015 --> 13:28.682
If I get a hard time about this,

13:28.766 --> 13:30.142
I'm telling people it was your idea.

13:30.226 --> 13:32.102
It was my idea.

13:46.117 --> 13:49.244
Just a minute. I'll be right back.

13:52.790 --> 13:55.083
Do you have to?

13:55.168 --> 13:57.753
Peter.

13:57.837 --> 14:01.381
That's risky business.

14:01.466 --> 14:03.717
It is, isn't it?

14:07.680 --> 14:10.307
What, honey?

14:10.391 --> 14:12.601
You can say anything to me.

14:19.734 --> 14:25.072
I can't provide for a child
on what I make.

14:26.741 --> 14:28.617
Don't worry about that.

14:32.080 --> 14:34.665
How could I not?

14:34.749 --> 14:36.458
You can't.

14:37.835 --> 14:39.920
Really?

14:40.004 --> 14:42.798
You can't worry about that.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.560
So stay here.

15:04.529 --> 15:07.864
Oh . . .Peter.

15:22.755 --> 15:23.755
Hi, Birdie.

15:28.803 --> 15:31.638
It's 9:30. Why didn't you
just stay in the city?

15:31.723 --> 15:35.183
Oh , I have work to do here as well .

15:35.268 --> 15:38.645
Do you know where
the slide projector is?

15:38.730 --> 15:40.856
So you're not going
to see us for four days,

15:40.940 --> 15:42.816
and you're not going to see us now.

15:42.900 --> 15:44.735
Bets, right when I walk in the door?

15:48.156 --> 15:49.573
I'm sorry.

15:51.159 --> 15:54.244
I'm sorry. I just-- I had a terrible day.

15:57.332 --> 15:59.583
Sit with me.

16:08.259 --> 16:09.384
What happened?

16:13.556 --> 16:14.765
Francine told me

16:14.849 --> 16:16.683
Carlton has been having an affair.

16:18.561 --> 16:20.771
Really?

16:22.190 --> 16:23.857
She was in pieces, Don.

16:23.941 --> 16:25.067
I didn't know what to say to her.

16:25.151 --> 16:28.111
Well , what could you say?

16:28.196 --> 16:29.863
I'm surprised she told you .

16:29.947 --> 16:31.782
Why?

16:31.866 --> 16:33.867
She's like a sister to me.

16:33.951 --> 16:36.161
Of course she is.

16:41.542 --> 16:43.794
I never liked Carlton .

16:43.878 --> 16:46.880
He was never my favorite.

16:46.964 --> 16:49.383
She should poison him .

16:49.467 --> 16:52.052
Now you think she should kill him?

16:52.136 --> 16:56.056
How could someone do that
to the person that they love?

16:56.140 --> 16:59.434
That they have children with?

16:59.519 --> 17:02.979
Doesn't this all mean anything?

17:05.983 --> 17:08.985
Who knows why people
do what they do?

17:21.040 --> 17:22.290
Come on .

17:22.375 --> 17:24.000
Bring the wine.

17:37.640 --> 17:39.474
It's actually a hell of a gadget.

17:39.559 --> 17:41.560
It's continuous, doesn't jam .

17:41.644 --> 17:43.937
They call it the Doughnut or the Wheel.

17:44.021 --> 17:46.398
They're expecting something
along those lines.

17:46.482 --> 17:47.941
Kodak reinvented the wheel.

17:48.025 --> 17:49.693
They're going to hear that ten times.

17:49.819 --> 17:53.947
They want you to use the words Research
and Development in the ads.

17:54.031 --> 17:57.033
But if you could find a way
to put the Wheel and the Future

17:57.118 --> 17:58.493
into something with some legs,

17:58.578 --> 18:01.037
you could make me look good
my first month here.

18:12.133 --> 18:14.676
"I never thought
it would happen to me,

18:14.761 --> 18:17.971
"but I regained my youth
and my happiness.

18:18.055 --> 18:19.973
"Just ask my husband .

18:20.057 --> 18:24.436
"I swear, he looks at me
like the night we met.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.354
"It's true that while simply relaxing

18:26.439 --> 18:27.981
I can get all the benefits of"--

18:28.065 --> 18:29.858
I'm sorry. We have to get a level here.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.568
No, we don't.

18:31.652 --> 18:35.071
She doesn't sound very confident.

18:35.156 --> 18:37.157
She just started .

18:37.241 --> 18:39.075
Give her a direction .

18:42.246 --> 18:43.789
Okay, Annie.

18:45.333 --> 18:47.083
Confidence.

18:48.252 --> 18:49.836
Okay.

18:49.921 --> 18:51.671
"I never thought
it would happen to me,

18:51.756 --> 18:55.008
"but I regained my youth
and my happiness.

18:55.092 --> 18:56.760
"Just ask my husband .

18:56.844 --> 19:00.430
I swear, he looks at me
like the night we met."

19:00.515 --> 19:01.681
Annie.

19:01.766 --> 19:02.766
Yes?

19:02.850 --> 19:03.934
Are you married?

19:04.018 --> 19:05.435
No.

19:05.520 --> 19:07.103
I could have told you that.

19:09.106 --> 19:12.776
Well, try and imagine
you're you , Annie,

19:12.860 --> 19:14.027
and now you have everything .

19:14.111 --> 19:16.029
You're beautiful, you're slim ,

19:16.113 --> 19:19.533
you're the beloved prize
of a handsome man,

19:19.617 --> 19:23.119
and you have everything when
you use the Relax-a-Cizor.

19:23.204 --> 19:24.454
Okay.

19:25.623 --> 19:28.542
It's too bad your voice is so annoying .

19:28.626 --> 19:30.961
"I never thought
it would happen to me,

19:31.045 --> 19:34.297
"but I regained my youth
and my happiness.

19:34.382 --> 19:36.049
Just ask my husband ."

19:36.133 --> 19:37.217
Hold on, Annie.

19:37.301 --> 19:39.719
We have a problem
with the tape recorder.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.473
Say something to her.

19:43.558 --> 19:46.059
Make her feel beautiful.

19:46.143 --> 19:48.061
You know, the confidence
that comes with beauty.

19:48.145 --> 19:50.897
Pegs, a woman who looks like that
will never sound confident

19:50.982 --> 19:52.357
because she never is confident.

19:52.441 --> 19:53.650
Baloney.

19:53.734 --> 19:55.402
Honey, it's God's gift to bachelors.

19:55.486 --> 19:58.071
The juiciest gazelle
is the easiest to catch.

19:58.155 --> 20:01.324
Can I-- I have a bit of a cold in my throat.

20:01.409 --> 20:03.451
Can I get some pineapple juice?

20:03.536 --> 20:05.871
There's a glass of water in the corner.

20:05.955 --> 20:07.455
It's great for your throat.

20:07.540 --> 20:10.166
I didn't believe that, either.

20:11.586 --> 20:14.170
Let's try it again , Annie.

20:14.255 --> 20:17.757
Happy, confident, beautiful .

20:19.594 --> 20:21.428
"I never thought
it would happen to me,

20:21.512 --> 20:24.723
"but I regained my youth
and my happiness.

20:24.807 --> 20:26.391
"Just ask my husband .

20:26.475 --> 20:28.560
I swear, he looks at me
like the night we"--

20:28.644 --> 20:29.686
Annie.

20:31.022 --> 20:32.522
You're married .

20:32.607 --> 20:35.483
Maybe you put on a few pounds,

20:35.568 --> 20:37.777
but then you got the Relax-a-Cizor,

20:37.862 --> 20:42.198
and you're back to being you , right now.

20:42.283 --> 20:46.119
I don't know that I understand .

20:46.203 --> 20:49.080
Annie, what don't you understand?

20:50.875 --> 20:53.168
I am being me.

20:54.295 --> 20:56.421
Just give me a second .

20:56.505 --> 20:58.340
I'll get it the way you want it.

21:01.218 --> 21:04.554
"I never thought
it would happen to me, but"--

21:07.058 --> 21:10.936
"I never thought this
would happen to me, but--"

21:14.732 --> 21:17.317
"I never thought
it would happen to me, but"--

21:19.070 --> 21:21.154
Look, Pegs, you dangled her
in front of me,

21:21.238 --> 21:22.447
and now you're ruining it.

21:22.531 --> 21:23.698
Don't do that to me.

21:23.783 --> 21:26.242
Kenny, be professional, would you?

21:27.328 --> 21:28.453
This is not working out.

21:28.537 --> 21:30.330
We're going to have to let you go.

21:32.667 --> 21:34.834
You could have gone
in there and said that.

21:40.633 --> 21:42.425
In this order,

21:42.510 --> 21:46.554
I want you to go after her
and console her.

21:46.639 --> 21:50.767
And after you make plans
or whatever you need to do,

21:50.851 --> 21:52.018
call Rita.

21:52.103 --> 21:53.770
The older lady you liked?

21:53.854 --> 21:56.189
She's probably home
with the Relax-a-Cizor right now.

22:53.080 --> 22:55.248
Can you get me the, uh . . .

22:55.332 --> 22:58.209
the Brighton Hotel, Times Square?

23:01.338 --> 23:02.338
Brighton .

23:02.506 --> 23:05.300
Yes. Uh , sorry to bother you so late.

23:05.384 --> 23:06.634
I'm looking for someone.

23:06.719 --> 23:09.220
A tenant of yours

23:09.305 --> 23:10.847
some-- some months back.

23:10.931 --> 23:11.931
A guest.

23:12.016 --> 23:13.266
Yes. Uh ,

23:13.350 --> 23:16.102
I'd love to know if he left
a forwarding address.

23:16.187 --> 23:17.687
His name is. . .

23:17.772 --> 23:18.980
Adam Whitman .

23:19.065 --> 23:21.775
Right. Can I ask what you want?

23:21.859 --> 23:23.276
Just a forwarding address.

23:23.360 --> 23:25.403
I'm trying to contact him .

23:25.488 --> 23:28.073
He has red hair. . .

23:28.157 --> 23:29.532
over 6 feet.

23:29.617 --> 23:32.744
Now listen . I know
who you're talking about.

23:34.205 --> 23:38.291
Jesus, I hate to be the one to tell you this,

23:38.375 --> 23:39.584
but he hung himself.

23:41.045 --> 23:42.253
What?

23:42.338 --> 23:43.379
Yeah .

23:45.382 --> 23:47.300
Adam Whitman .

23:47.384 --> 23:48.843
Yeah. I'm sorry.

23:48.928 --> 23:51.012
Left the building a bunch of money.

23:51.097 --> 23:52.305
The city took it.

23:52.389 --> 23:53.973
It was in the Post.

23:54.058 --> 23:55.892
Oh .

23:55.976 --> 23:57.060
Well,

23:57.144 --> 23:59.562
I hate to be the one to give that news.

24:01.982 --> 24:03.399
Okay.

25:45.836 --> 25:47.295
Hello.

25:49.298 --> 25:52.133
Yes. Hello.

25:53.719 --> 26:00.600
Who is this?

26:00.684 --> 26:02.352
This is Dr. Arnold Wayne.

26:10.527 --> 26:14.197
Mrs. Albertson, I have warned you ,
this is inappropriate.

26:45.104 --> 26:46.521
Are we on fire?

26:47.690 --> 26:48.982
Don.

26:50.317 --> 26:54.570
No. I , uh . . .dropped a cigarette
in my waste basket.

26:54.655 --> 26:57.573
Harry, come here. I want to talk to you .

26:58.742 --> 27:00.451
Okay.

27:17.177 --> 27:19.595
Harry, I want to talk to you .

27:20.973 --> 27:22.557
I can explain .

27:24.476 --> 27:26.936
What is the benefit of that thing?

27:32.609 --> 27:35.320
It sells projectors to people
who already have them .

27:35.404 --> 27:37.655
Yeah, the wheel.

27:37.740 --> 27:40.241
Stacks, you store your slides in it,

27:40.326 --> 27:42.702
and it's ready to go.

27:42.786 --> 27:44.787
I took pictures for the paper at Wisconsin .

27:44.872 --> 27:47.373
The machinery is definitely
part of the fun .

27:47.458 --> 27:48.541
It's mechanical.

27:48.625 --> 27:50.418
What did you take pictures of?

27:50.502 --> 27:52.545
Girls, mostly.

27:52.629 --> 27:55.340
You could go up and ask them
their names afterwards

27:55.424 --> 27:58.551
like you were going to put it in the paper.

27:58.635 --> 28:00.094
And some other stuff.

28:00.179 --> 28:02.263
Artsy-craftsy stuff.

28:02.348 --> 28:03.639
They gave me hell about it.

28:03.724 --> 28:05.016
Artsy, like what?

28:05.100 --> 28:09.479
Like the reflection of a tree in a pond?

28:09.563 --> 28:10.813
Uh, worse.

28:10.898 --> 28:16.652
I did a whole series
that was just handprints on glass.

28:17.821 --> 28:20.573
You know, the way
it fogs up around your heat.

28:20.657 --> 28:23.034
Take it off, take a picture.

28:23.118 --> 28:24.285
Black and white, I suppose.

28:24.370 --> 28:25.536
Of course.

28:27.498 --> 28:30.583
I was always fascinated
by the cave paintings of Lascaux.

28:30.667 --> 28:33.586
They're, like, 1 7,000 years old .

28:33.670 --> 28:36.255
The bison get all the attention ,

28:36.340 --> 28:39.717
but there are also
all of these handprints,

28:39.802 --> 28:41.594
tiny by today's standards,

28:41.678 --> 28:44.597
with paint blown all around them .

28:44.681 --> 28:46.891
Signature of the artist.

28:48.310 --> 28:52.605
But I thought it was like someone. . .

28:52.689 --> 28:56.984
reaching through the stone
and right to us.

28:58.612 --> 29:00.696
"I was here."

29:06.829 --> 29:08.329
Are you okay?

29:09.373 --> 29:11.707
That'll be all.

30:11.977 --> 30:15.146
Glen?

30:16.523 --> 30:18.316
I'm not supposed to talk to you .

30:20.777 --> 30:22.528
Who says-- Who said that?

30:22.613 --> 30:25.948
My mother and my father.

30:27.201 --> 30:28.493
I don't care.

30:31.788 --> 30:34.207
My mother's going to come out.

30:36.210 --> 30:38.169
I don't care.

30:44.551 --> 30:45.593
Glen--

30:47.679 --> 30:49.514
I can't talk to anyone.

30:51.433 --> 30:53.643
It's so horrible.

30:58.815 --> 31:00.608
I'm so sad .

31:15.207 --> 31:17.166
Don't cry.

31:21.171 --> 31:22.838
Please. . .

31:26.134 --> 31:28.594
Please tell me I'll be okay.

31:30.847 --> 31:32.848
I don't know.

31:34.893 --> 31:37.812
I wish I was older.

31:37.896 --> 31:40.523
Oh, adults don't know anything , Glen .

31:45.404 --> 31:48.656
I don't really know
how long 20 minutes is.

31:51.868 --> 31:53.411
Of course, dear.

32:04.881 --> 32:08.301
Don, I hope I'm not bothering you .

32:08.385 --> 32:13.014
I just wanted to let you know
I took Duck's talk very seriously.

32:13.098 --> 32:15.808
And without having to crack
my Deerfield yearbook,

32:15.892 --> 32:17.977
I've brought in an account.

32:18.061 --> 32:20.521
Good for you .

32:20.606 --> 32:22.982
It's a piece of Vicks Chemical Company.

32:23.066 --> 32:24.066
Clearasil.

32:25.193 --> 32:26.444
Better potential

32:26.528 --> 32:28.404
than any traditional
pharmaceutical, I believe.

32:28.488 --> 32:31.073
That's a real account, Campbell .

32:31.158 --> 32:32.950
How'd that happen?

32:33.035 --> 32:34.577
I'm not embarrassed to say

32:34.661 --> 32:37.663
my father-in-law's a former salesman ,
now executive there.

32:37.748 --> 32:39.498
That's generous.

32:39.583 --> 32:43.002
He's interested in my future.

32:43.086 --> 32:44.211
Congratulations.

32:44.296 --> 32:47.840
I'm sure, with a little bit of lawyering ,
you're entitled to that bonus.

32:47.924 --> 32:49.675
I got the bonus.

32:49.760 --> 32:52.261
And Cooper gave me
some book by Ayn Rand .

32:52.346 --> 32:55.181
He seemed assured , as I hope you are,

32:55.265 --> 32:57.933
that I have a significant
investment in this company.

32:59.978 --> 33:02.355
Well , you do now, don't you?

33:03.732 --> 33:06.734
It matters to me that you're impressed .

33:08.570 --> 33:09.945
I am .

33:12.991 --> 33:15.034
Self-worth and status.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.079
You said it.

34:02.124 --> 34:03.999
Thanksgiving .

34:06.670 --> 34:08.796
It's very n-nerve-wracking ,

34:08.880 --> 34:12.925
having to deal with getting
the family together.

34:13.009 --> 34:16.262
My m-- My mother didn't. . .

34:16.346 --> 34:20.558
cook last year
because she was so sick.

34:20.642 --> 34:24.019
And now I'm going
to have to deal with Gloria.

34:30.152 --> 34:32.945
But it is Thanksgiving, and . . .

34:33.029 --> 34:35.322
I'm grateful for things.

34:38.118 --> 34:39.994
Like this.

34:40.078 --> 34:44.415
This has helped .

34:44.499 --> 34:47.626
Don doesn't think so, but it has.

34:52.924 --> 34:55.050
Being able to talk.

34:55.135 --> 34:59.430
Just-- Just me and you
and your little pad .

35:01.057 --> 35:03.058
It has helped .

35:04.853 --> 35:06.979
Still , I--

35:07.063 --> 35:12.735
I can't help but think
that I would be happy

35:12.819 --> 35:16.071
if my husband was faithful to me.

35:25.832 --> 35:30.211
My brother's children are
very badly behaved, and . . .

35:30.295 --> 35:32.838
he spanks them .

35:32.923 --> 35:35.800
Don has never laid a hand on the kids.

35:35.884 --> 35:38.093
He's kind inside.

35:41.723 --> 35:43.265
But outside, it--

35:46.228 --> 35:49.104
it's all there in my face every day.

35:51.358 --> 35:53.400
The hotel rooms.

35:56.404 --> 35:58.489
Sometimes perfume. . .

36:00.951 --> 36:03.369
or worse.

36:06.039 --> 36:07.790
He doesn't know what family is.

36:09.167 --> 36:11.252
He doesn't even have one.

36:13.129 --> 36:15.506
It makes me sorry for him . . .

36:19.970 --> 36:22.054
when in fact I--

36:22.138 --> 36:25.015
I should be angry. . .

36:25.100 --> 36:27.560
very angry, you know?

36:29.145 --> 36:34.149
But I put up with it, like some ostrich .

36:39.155 --> 36:41.824
It's interesting , isn't it?

37:07.183 --> 37:08.601
The way he m--

37:08.685 --> 37:10.728
he makes love. . .

37:13.899 --> 37:16.191
sometimes it's what I want.

37:19.487 --> 37:23.532
But sometimes it's obviously
what someone else wants.

37:40.050 --> 37:43.010
I suppose it means I'm not enough .

37:51.227 --> 37:53.062
But maybe it--

37:54.522 --> 37:56.357
it's just him .

38:08.244 --> 38:10.037
Don Draper and Salvatore Romano,

38:10.121 --> 38:12.706
this is Joe Harriman and Lynn Taylor.

38:12.791 --> 38:14.166
No Eastmans today, unfortunately.

38:14.250 --> 38:15.584
They're all back in the lab.

38:15.669 --> 38:18.963
It's a wonderful facility,
but they don't take vacations.

38:19.047 --> 38:21.131
What do they show,
slides of them working?

38:23.385 --> 38:26.929
So have you figured out a way
to work the wheel into it?

38:27.013 --> 38:28.180
We know it's hard

38:28.264 --> 38:30.641
because wheels aren't really seen
as exciting technology,

38:30.725 --> 38:32.184
even though they are the original.

38:32.268 --> 38:38.190
Well, technology is a glittering lure,

38:38.274 --> 38:40.359
but there's the rare occasion

38:40.443 --> 38:43.988
when the public can be engaged
on the level beyond flash,

38:44.072 --> 38:48.909
if they have a sentimental
bond with the product.

38:48.994 --> 38:53.205
My first job,
I was in house at a fur company

38:53.289 --> 38:57.126
with this old pro copyrighter,
a Greek named Teddy.

38:57.210 --> 39:03.173
And Teddy told me the most
important idea in advertising is "new."

39:04.259 --> 39:05.884
Creates an itch .

39:05.969 --> 39:07.636
You simply put your product in there

39:07.721 --> 39:10.305
as a kind of. . . calamine lotion .

39:11.307 --> 39:16.603
He also talked about a deeper bond
with the product.

39:16.688 --> 39:19.148
Nostalgia.

39:19.232 --> 39:22.234
It's delicate. . .

39:22.318 --> 39:24.528
but potent.

39:24.612 --> 39:26.113
Sweetheart.

39:36.708 --> 39:39.209
Teddy told me that in Greek,

39:39.294 --> 39:44.715
nostalgia literally means
the pain from an old wound .

39:49.345 --> 39:51.930
It's a twinge in your heart

39:52.015 --> 39:55.350
far more powerful than memory alone.

39:57.854 --> 39:59.646
This device. . .

39:59.731 --> 40:02.816
isn't a space ship.

40:02.901 --> 40:05.277
It's a time machine.

40:08.782 --> 40:12.284
It goes backwards, forwards.

40:17.290 --> 40:22.461
It takes us to a place
where we ache to go again .

40:28.551 --> 40:30.385
It's not called the Wheel .

40:32.055 --> 40:34.389
It's called the Carousel.

40:38.686 --> 40:43.107
It lets us travel the way a child travels.

40:44.484 --> 40:48.362
Around and around
and back home again . . .

40:52.575 --> 40:55.911
to a place where we know
we are loved .

41:31.114 --> 41:33.407
Good luck at your next meeting .

41:38.121 --> 41:40.372
Don , I have to warn you , I'm not alone.

41:40.456 --> 41:41.832
It was beautiful .

41:41.916 --> 41:44.376
Congratulations, mein Kommandant.

41:44.460 --> 41:45.878
They called from the lobby.

41:45.962 --> 41:48.672
They cancelled their other meetings,
including DDB.

41:48.756 --> 41:50.215
Not just a victory for us.

41:50.300 --> 41:51.383
It's a victory for civilization .

41:51.467 --> 41:53.760
There's also more celebrating .

41:53.845 --> 41:56.763
Mr, Campbell, here,
your father-in-law called .

41:56.848 --> 41:58.682
he'll be in before Christmas.

41:58.766 --> 42:00.601
I've got to get married .

42:01.936 --> 42:04.229
No, thank you . I'm good .

42:09.402 --> 42:10.402
Here's how.

42:10.486 --> 42:11.486
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

42:14.532 --> 42:16.909
You know what, Pete?

42:16.993 --> 42:20.579
I've got a way for you
to turn this account into a home run .

42:20.663 --> 42:23.123
He's on a roll .

42:23.208 --> 42:24.458
Clearasil.

42:24.542 --> 42:26.627
You know who buys that?

42:26.711 --> 42:28.420
Young girls.

42:28.504 --> 42:31.715
What a difference it makes in their lives
to be blemish-free.

42:31.799 --> 42:33.592
I believe it does.

42:33.676 --> 42:37.179
We have the perfect writer for that.

42:37.263 --> 42:38.639
Peggy Olsen .

42:40.141 --> 42:41.767
That's funny.

42:41.851 --> 42:45.270
Freddy Rumsen and I were both
very impressed with her insight.

42:45.355 --> 42:46.396
Freddy Rumsen .

42:46.481 --> 42:47.689
- If I can weigh in--
- No.

42:47.774 --> 42:49.399
Come on . That Belle Jolie thing .

42:49.484 --> 42:51.443
Plus you should have seen her
in that booth yesterday.

42:51.527 --> 42:53.195
She was like Kinsey but with balls.

42:54.364 --> 42:55.822
Stop joking already, will you , Don?

42:55.907 --> 42:57.324
Excuse me?

42:57.408 --> 42:59.826
This is my father-in-law.

42:59.911 --> 43:01.578
He's expecting the very best.

43:01.663 --> 43:04.206
I'm expecting the very best,

43:04.290 --> 43:07.876
not some little girl who'll walk away.

43:07.961 --> 43:11.380
You'll have to give back
that copy of Ayn Rand .

43:11.464 --> 43:13.465
Do you know how hard I worked
to get this account?

43:13.549 --> 43:14.549
Who the hell is she?

43:14.634 --> 43:16.468
Peggy is not even a copywriter.

43:16.552 --> 43:17.678
She's a-- a secretary.

43:17.762 --> 43:18.762
Peggy!

43:18.846 --> 43:20.472
Yes, Mr. Draper?

43:20.556 --> 43:24.685
Miss Olsen, you are now a junior copywriter.

43:24.769 --> 43:29.481
Your first account will be delivering
Clearasil to the spotted masses.

43:29.565 --> 43:30.565
What?

43:30.650 --> 43:32.484
Don't act surprised .

43:32.568 --> 43:34.903
Is this really happening?

43:36.698 --> 43:37.948
Yes, it is.

43:39.534 --> 43:40.701
My goodness.

43:42.954 --> 43:45.914
I will do my sincere best.

43:48.126 --> 43:49.710
Good to hear.

43:49.794 --> 43:53.588
Mr, Campbell, here,
will brief you after the holiday.

43:57.218 --> 43:59.845
Of course.

43:59.929 --> 44:01.513
That'll be all.

44:01.597 --> 44:04.558
Thank you , Mr. Draper.

44:08.980 --> 44:11.940
I said congratulations, didn't I?

44:12.025 --> 44:14.693
Although sometimes when
people get what they want,

44:14.777 --> 44:17.070
they realize how limited
their goals were.

44:17.155 --> 44:19.531
So I guess I'll put you
in with Victor Manning.

44:19.615 --> 44:21.533
David Steuben got fired .

44:21.617 --> 44:22.784
Fired?

44:22.869 --> 44:24.494
People hated his work.

44:25.621 --> 44:26.997
Will I get business cards?

44:28.750 --> 44:31.418
Please make all your
requests through Bridget.

44:31.502 --> 44:32.502
Of course.

44:32.587 --> 44:34.087
Peggy, I know you a little.

44:34.172 --> 44:36.715
Remember, just because
you now have a door,

44:36.799 --> 44:39.092
don't forget that once you didn't.

44:39.177 --> 44:41.928
Think of the other girls,
or they won't think of you .

44:44.349 --> 44:46.767
Vic Manning , I'd like you
to meet Peggy Olsen .

44:46.851 --> 44:48.310
She'll be taking Mr. Steuben's desk.

44:48.394 --> 44:49.686
Nice to meet you .

44:51.564 --> 44:53.482
I don't feel so swell .

44:53.566 --> 44:55.108
I think I should go home.

44:55.193 --> 44:58.070
I have to stop eating off the cart.

44:58.154 --> 45:00.155
If you're trying to find
a way to go out and celebrate,

45:00.239 --> 45:01.615
you should ask your secretary
to cover for you .

45:01.699 --> 45:03.033
Very funny.

45:04.535 --> 45:06.203
Happy Thanksgiving .

45:06.287 --> 45:07.329
You, too, Joan.

45:07.413 --> 45:09.581
David and I had a deal.

45:09.665 --> 45:11.416
No meetings in here, okay?

45:11.501 --> 45:12.626
And no music.

45:27.141 --> 45:28.725
What can we do for you today?

45:28.810 --> 45:31.603
My stomach hurts really bad .

45:31.687 --> 45:34.439
I think I had a bad sandwich .

45:34.524 --> 45:36.400
Let's take a look.

45:44.700 --> 45:46.243
Oh , my God .

45:46.327 --> 45:50.664
Honey, you didn't mention
that you were expecting .

45:50.748 --> 45:52.624
What?

45:52.708 --> 45:54.459
You're going to be a mother.

45:58.131 --> 45:59.506
That's impossible.

45:59.590 --> 46:03.051
You want us to call your husband
or your boyfriend?

46:05.555 --> 46:06.638
I don't understand .

46:06.722 --> 46:08.265
Stop talking .

46:11.644 --> 46:14.229
Now listen , we're going
to get you up to Maternity.

46:14.313 --> 46:17.732
No. No, that's not possible.

46:24.740 --> 46:26.241
Do you feel that?

46:39.714 --> 46:40.714
My God !

46:40.798 --> 46:42.215
We need a wheelchair.

46:42.300 --> 46:43.675
It hurts!

46:43.759 --> 46:45.677
It's going to be okay, all right?

46:45.761 --> 46:47.304
We just want you to calm down .

46:47.388 --> 46:48.388
You don't understand .

46:48.473 --> 46:50.307
We need a wheelchair!

46:53.644 --> 46:56.480
Call Dr. Wilson in Psychiatry.

47:06.532 --> 47:08.575
Oh .

47:08.659 --> 47:10.285
Hello, darling .

47:15.500 --> 47:17.709
Oh , were they having
a party at the office?

47:17.793 --> 47:18.793
Yes.

47:20.463 --> 47:22.380
I think I should . . .

47:22.465 --> 47:23.798
lie down .

47:23.883 --> 47:26.635
That's a good idea.

47:26.719 --> 47:28.720
Sure. Rest up.

47:28.804 --> 47:30.847
But make sure you're awake later.

47:30.932 --> 47:32.766
Daddy!

47:57.875 --> 48:00.835
Would you like to try to feed him?

48:04.257 --> 48:06.841
Don't you want
to hold him , sweetheart?

48:55.641 --> 48:57.183
Hello?

48:57.268 --> 48:59.102
Don?

49:06.485 --> 49:07.819
What are you doing here?

49:07.903 --> 49:10.405
Daddy! Are you coming with us?

49:10.489 --> 49:13.825
No, he isn't. Daddy has to work.

49:13.909 --> 49:15.827
But you can drive us
to the station .

49:15.911 --> 49:17.329
I haven't called the taxi yet.

49:17.413 --> 49:18.913
I'm coming with you .

49:20.916 --> 49:23.126
Really?

49:23.210 --> 49:25.086
You are?

49:25.171 --> 49:26.838
I'll pack the car.

49:26.922 --> 49:28.506
We'll be there before midnight.

49:35.848 --> 49:36.848
Daddy's coming with you .

49:36.932 --> 49:37.932
- Daddy!
- Daddy!

49:40.436 --> 49:42.520
Oh , my goodness.

49:50.946 --> 49:51.988
Hello?

49:55.576 --> 49:56.910
Hello.

51:49.982 --> 51:52.984
