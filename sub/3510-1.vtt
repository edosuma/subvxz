00:00.070 --> 00:01.273
<i>Previously on "Castle"...</i>

00:01.341 --> 00:03.652
They killed my mother.
What do you want me to do here?

00:03.719 --> 00:06.709
Beckett, everyone associated
with this case is dead.

00:06.788 --> 00:08.431
Walk away.
Well, last time I checked,

00:08.503 --> 00:11.651
it was my life, not your
personal jungle gym.

00:11.719 --> 00:13.560
I know you crawled inside
your mother's murder

00:13.629 --> 00:14.602
and didn't come out.

00:14.671 --> 00:16.357
The same way you hide in
these nowhere relationships

00:16.420 --> 00:17.802
with men you don't love.

00:17.885 --> 00:19.499
You know what we are, Castle?
We are over.

00:19.567 --> 00:21.228
Captain Montgomery's
part of the conspiracy.

00:21.287 --> 00:22.483
He's been lying to
us the whole time.

00:22.558 --> 00:23.724
Did you kill my mother?

00:23.797 --> 00:26.298
No, but she died because
of what we did that night.

00:26.367 --> 00:28.514
Then who killed her? No, Kate.
I give you a name. I know you.

00:28.618 --> 00:29.630
You'll run straight at him.

00:29.709 --> 00:31.028
I might as well shoot
you where you stand.

00:31.084 --> 00:32.020
Now they're coming.

00:32.085 --> 00:34.759
Castle, get her outta here.

00:35.280 --> 00:37.285
No! Please!

00:38.370 --> 00:40.579
Where is she, Roy?
You can't have her.

00:41.247 --> 00:42.742
You can't hide her from us.

00:45.245 --> 00:46.902
So that was what,
your last stand?

00:46.986 --> 00:48.443
I'm just gonna kill her anyway.

00:48.503 --> 00:49.782
No, you're not.

00:49.855 --> 00:51.076
And he's not.

00:51.145 --> 00:53.955
I saw to that.
You're done, Lockwood.

00:54.028 --> 00:56.528
We both are.

00:56.596 --> 00:59.665
No one outside of
this immediate family

00:59.750 --> 01:02.224
ever needs to know about this.

01:02.308 --> 01:03.657
As far as the world is concerned,

01:03.721 --> 01:05.586
Roy Montgomery died a hero.

01:07.019 --> 01:08.068
Kate!

01:08.139 --> 01:10.037
Oh! Oh, no!

01:10.142 --> 01:12.631
Kate. Stay with me, Kate.
Find the shooter!

01:13.005 --> 01:14.146
I love you.

01:14.353 --> 01:15.693
I love you, Kate.

01:20.448 --> 01:21.772
She's tachying out.

01:22.714 --> 01:23.594
Come on!

01:24.351 --> 01:26.280
Pulse ox... respiration...
Set up for intubation.

01:26.338 --> 01:27.715
78 over 56.

01:31.596 --> 01:34.017
Come on, Kate.
Don't you die on me.

01:34.088 --> 01:36.035
Stay with me. Stay with me.

01:36.095 --> 01:38.685
Single GSW to left chest.
Do not die.

01:38.750 --> 01:40.842
Come on, girl. Come on.
Set up for a chest tube. Trauma one.

01:40.902 --> 01:42.299
Switch. We got this.
This is my friend.

01:42.368 --> 01:43.938
You understand me?
She's my friend.

01:43.996 --> 01:46.040
Then let us save her life.

01:48.000 --> 01:54.074

01:59.154 --> 02:01.027
31-year-old female.
GSW to the left chest.

02:01.066 --> 02:01.988
Crashed on the way in.

02:02.004 --> 02:03.996
Trauma room is prepped.
Trauma team's on the way.

02:04.021 --> 02:05.465
Okay, stop compressions.

02:07.668 --> 02:09.292
We have a rhythm.
Let's check for breathing.

02:09.353 --> 02:10.931
We need a second line.

02:12.092 --> 02:13.583
Kate.

02:14.951 --> 02:16.859
Uh, her breathing is shallow.
Let's get her on the table.

02:16.876 --> 02:18.868
One, two, three.

02:20.085 --> 02:22.328
Page Dr. Kovaks.
Tell him he has to take over.

02:22.412 --> 02:23.594
Who is she?

02:23.687 --> 02:25.626
She's my girlfriend.

02:25.679 --> 02:26.771
What do you mean, you
couldn't find him?

02:26.803 --> 02:29.225
I want security checkpoints
at all entrances and exits.

02:29.271 --> 02:30.770
No, he didn't just disappear.
If there's any surveillance cameras

02:30.844 --> 02:31.635
within ten blocks of that place...
Damn it.

02:31.704 --> 02:32.591
I want that footage on
my desk in an hour.

02:32.665 --> 02:33.474
I want statements from everyone.

02:33.524 --> 02:34.876
No. One hour!

02:35.880 --> 02:37.459
Okay. Okay.

02:37.980 --> 02:38.904
How is she?

02:38.963 --> 02:41.440
They just took her
to surgery, but...

02:41.798 --> 02:42.973
We need a chest tube.

02:43.049 --> 02:45.028
BP's 86 over 60.

02:47.924 --> 02:48.928
Where's that chest tube?

02:49.027 --> 02:51.954
Behind you.

02:52.034 --> 02:56.015
Come on, Kate. Come on.
Stay with me.

02:56.088 --> 02:58.167
Stay with me, Kate. I've got you.

02:58.234 --> 03:00.153
Damn it!
Bleeding in the left chest.

03:00.222 --> 03:01.709
SATs are 88.
Tension pneumo's relieved,

03:01.783 --> 03:03.231
but she's still decreased.

03:03.290 --> 03:05.173
Okay, we can't wait.
Set up for intubation.

03:05.253 --> 03:06.687
You can't operate on her.
She's your girlfriend.

03:06.754 --> 03:09.065
She's dying. I'm not waiting.

03:10.076 --> 03:12.591
You were at a funeral, Kate.
How the hell did you get shot?

03:12.689 --> 03:14.571
What about the shooter?

03:14.650 --> 03:16.628
Gone.
Gone? How can he be gone?

03:16.692 --> 03:18.748
We don't know, but he
left his weapon behind.

03:18.855 --> 03:21.386
It's a Mark 11
modified sniper rifle,

03:21.464 --> 03:23.631
favorite of special forces.
We're checking for prints now.

03:23.710 --> 03:24.429
Richard.

03:24.499 --> 03:26.379
Dad. Oh, my god.

03:26.468 --> 03:27.884
Shh. It's okay. It's okay.

03:27.938 --> 03:29.718
Dad.

03:30.758 --> 03:32.170
Where's Katie?

03:33.084 --> 03:34.636
Where's my daughter?

03:34.715 --> 03:36.638
BP's 80 over 60.

03:38.131 --> 03:39.895
78 over 56.

03:39.964 --> 03:41.368
There's too much blood.

03:41.440 --> 03:43.993
Where the hell are you
bleeding from, Kate?

03:44.344 --> 03:46.182
Pulmonary vein. Clamp.

03:49.992 --> 03:51.945
Okay.
I got you, you son of a bitch.

03:52.068 --> 03:53.665
3-0 silk.
Blood pressure's still dropping.

03:53.744 --> 03:55.898
Got here as fast as I could.
31-year-old female,

03:55.962 --> 03:57.013
single GSW to the chest.

03:57.076 --> 03:58.221
It's okay, I got this.

03:58.294 --> 03:59.917
Left tension pneumo
alleviated a chest tube,

03:59.986 --> 04:01.246
which revealed significant
bleeding in the chest.

04:01.324 --> 04:02.397
I said, I got this.

04:02.480 --> 04:04.143
The bleeder was a left
inferior pulmonary vein,

04:04.197 --> 04:05.399
which Dr. Davidson just clamped.

04:05.453 --> 04:06.659
Josh, step aside.

04:06.723 --> 04:08.990
Already in.
Just let me sew her up.

04:09.760 --> 04:10.951
You did what you had to.

04:11.039 --> 04:14.108
Now...
do what you're supposed to.

04:17.908 --> 04:21.005
Dr. Davidson.

04:22.115 --> 04:23.894
Suction.

04:23.958 --> 04:24.721
3-0.

04:24.803 --> 04:26.782
Here's the 3-0.

04:27.918 --> 04:30.238
A sniper? At a funeral?

04:30.316 --> 04:31.941
We think the people who sent
those guys after Montgomery

04:32.004 --> 04:33.336
targeted Beckett.

04:33.429 --> 04:34.830
I tried to get to her. I tried--

04:34.892 --> 04:36.954
Hey! Oh!
Who the hell do you think you--

04:37.008 --> 04:39.334
Dad! Dad! You did this!
This is your fault.

04:39.397 --> 04:42.291
BP's still dropping.
SATs are falling as well.

04:42.379 --> 04:44.182
She must be bleeding
somewhere else.

04:44.256 --> 04:45.555
Where? There's no blood.

04:45.649 --> 04:47.221
You pushed her to look
into her mother's murder!

04:47.284 --> 04:48.284
She was shot because of you,

04:48.365 --> 04:50.416
and Montgomery is dead because of you!
Leave him alone!

04:50.480 --> 04:53.522
Stop it! Stop it, all of you.
Just stop it!

04:53.857 --> 04:55.274
I won't have you acting
like 3 year olds

04:55.345 --> 04:57.374
while my daughter's
fighting for her life.

05:00.954 --> 05:03.193
Her pericardium's distended.

05:03.755 --> 05:05.729
She's bleeding into it.
That's why there's no blood.

05:05.821 --> 05:08.280
It's compressing her heart.
Scissors.

05:08.359 --> 05:10.948
BP's dropping. 65/45.

05:12.378 --> 05:13.916
Got it.

05:14.049 --> 05:16.623
Bullet grazed the ventricle. 3-0.

05:18.221 --> 05:20.531
She's going into V-Fib. Paddles.

05:21.309 --> 05:23.301
He's right, you know?

05:23.360 --> 05:24.670
This is my fault.

05:24.735 --> 05:27.328
Richard Castle, don't you
dare blame yourself.

05:27.416 --> 05:29.314
You are not the one who shot her.

05:29.392 --> 05:31.577
Charge to 10. Charging.

05:32.035 --> 05:33.648
Charged.

05:33.717 --> 05:34.615
Clear.

05:36.533 --> 05:38.164
No.

05:38.923 --> 05:41.408
But I put her in the crosshairs.

05:43.607 --> 05:46.241
Still fibrillating. Charge to 20.

05:47.535 --> 05:49.121
Charging.

05:50.747 --> 05:53.293
I told her how I felt.

05:53.352 --> 05:55.026
I told her I loved her.

05:55.099 --> 05:56.631
Clear.

06:13.352 --> 06:15.226
Mr. Beckett?

06:15.308 --> 06:16.770
Yes.

06:16.897 --> 06:19.195
Your daughter is out of surgery.

06:19.374 --> 06:21.001
Will she be all right?

06:21.113 --> 06:25.038
Well, during the surgery, she
experienced cardiac arrest.

06:25.156 --> 06:28.188
Now we were able to get her
heart beating again on its own,

06:28.293 --> 06:31.497
but... we'll need to
watch her very closely.

06:31.601 --> 06:32.626
When can I see her?

06:32.721 --> 06:33.862
Well, once the nurses
get her settled,

06:33.933 --> 06:35.858
we'll bring you back to her.

06:35.950 --> 06:40.107
The rest of you should
go home, get some rest.

06:40.373 --> 06:41.966
I don't know about you, bro,

06:42.064 --> 06:43.845
but home is the last
place I'm going.

06:43.909 --> 06:45.897
Not till we catch the son
of a bitch who did this.

06:45.970 --> 06:47.920
Right behind you.

06:47.994 --> 06:50.348
We're fine. Go.

06:51.192 --> 06:52.321
Are you okay?

06:52.384 --> 06:53.947
Yeah.

06:58.154 --> 07:00.208
The shooter's rifle.

07:01.070 --> 07:02.538
It's clean for prints.

07:02.636 --> 07:04.214
Lab's running trace
right now for DNA.

07:04.292 --> 07:06.182
Well, what about the gun?
Can we track the gun?

07:06.271 --> 07:07.538
According to the DOD,
the serial number

07:07.585 --> 07:10.488
matches a weapon that was
issued to one martin holst,

07:10.577 --> 07:13.424
a navy seal who was killed
in action seven years ago.

07:13.517 --> 07:15.162
His body was recovered
in a subsequent mission,

07:15.246 --> 07:17.756
but the weapon was not.

07:17.834 --> 07:19.005
Anything from the canine unit?

07:19.057 --> 07:20.039
Dogs picked up a scent.

07:20.132 --> 07:21.480
Traced it to the west
side of the cemetery,

07:21.534 --> 07:22.695
but then they lost it there.

07:22.778 --> 07:24.954
In a sea of cops, how does
this guy go unnoticed?

07:25.042 --> 07:26.464
He may not have.

07:26.542 --> 07:27.974
Half the guys we talked to
said they remember seeing

07:28.039 --> 07:31.099
a groundskeeper taking cover
from the shooter behind a tree.

07:31.198 --> 07:32.409
But according to
the grounds staff,

07:32.477 --> 07:33.593
none of them were in the area.

07:33.662 --> 07:35.686
He blended in during the
chaos and then disappeared.

07:35.780 --> 07:37.208
If this guy's some pro for hire,

07:37.257 --> 07:38.704
he could be halfway
to Cuba by now.

07:38.761 --> 07:40.984
Then we'll go to Cuba
and find his ass.

07:42.546 --> 07:44.691
It just doesn't make any sense.

07:44.748 --> 07:46.871
It was supposed to be over.

07:48.476 --> 07:50.992
Montgomery sacrificed himself.

07:51.075 --> 07:52.718
Killing Lockwood and
all of his guys,

07:52.803 --> 07:54.209
he said he was ending it.

07:54.268 --> 07:57.365
He said he was doing
it to keep her safe.

07:58.145 --> 07:59.974
So if the plan was
to keep her safe,

08:00.061 --> 08:01.830
then why the hell are they
still coming after her?

08:01.893 --> 08:03.455
I don't know, bro.

08:03.535 --> 08:05.567
God knows who else is involved.

08:39.397 --> 08:41.264
Castle.

08:43.264 --> 08:45.395
Yeah. Are you sure?

08:57.072 --> 08:58.813
No, this bracelet
looks good on you.

08:58.872 --> 09:00.880
It's not diamonds.

09:02.215 --> 09:04.389
Hey, Castle.

09:06.414 --> 09:07.821
I'll see you after rounds.

09:07.953 --> 09:09.280
Yeah.

09:21.486 --> 09:22.727
Hey.

09:24.645 --> 09:28.054
You're staring at me.
I must look really bad.

09:28.166 --> 09:29.095
No.

09:29.163 --> 09:31.554
I just never thought
I'd see you again.

09:33.642 --> 09:36.457
I heard you were opening
a flower store,

09:36.547 --> 09:38.960
so I thought I'd pitch in.

09:42.591 --> 09:43.997
They were all here
when I woke up.

09:44.072 --> 09:46.684
I think they're mostly
from the precinct.

09:46.772 --> 09:48.873
I don't think I'm gonna
live this one down, Castle.

09:48.951 --> 09:51.505
Oh... probably not.

09:55.917 --> 09:57.845
I hear that you tried to save me.

09:57.932 --> 09:59.979
Yeah, I, uh...

10:01.732 --> 10:04.039
You heard?

10:04.753 --> 10:06.447
You don't remember
me tackling you?

10:06.546 --> 10:09.089
No, I don't remember
much of anything.

10:09.388 --> 10:12.366
I, um, remember that
I was on the podium.

10:12.419 --> 10:15.182
And then I remember
everything just going black.

10:15.247 --> 10:17.608
You don't remember...

10:21.286 --> 10:23.077
the gunshot?

10:23.146 --> 10:25.061
No.

10:27.767 --> 10:28.850
They say that there
are some things

10:28.924 --> 10:31.719
that are better not
being remembered.

10:32.046 --> 10:33.511
Yeah.

10:33.599 --> 10:34.922
I keep seeing his face, Castle.

10:34.995 --> 10:35.825
Every time I close my eyes,

10:35.898 --> 10:39.430
I see Montgomery lying
on the hangar floor.

10:41.947 --> 10:43.301
You shoulda let me go in there.

10:43.374 --> 10:44.350
They would've killed you.

10:44.424 --> 10:46.033
Oh, you don't know that.

10:46.113 --> 10:48.628
Kate--
Castle...

10:48.696 --> 10:50.007
I'm really tired...

10:50.076 --> 10:52.469
Right now.

10:52.552 --> 10:54.908
Of course.

10:55.604 --> 10:58.116
Of course. We'll talk tomorrow.

10:58.184 --> 11:01.047
Do you mind if we don't?

11:01.452 --> 11:04.437
I just need a little bit of time.

11:04.501 --> 11:05.356
Sure.

11:05.402 --> 11:07.372
Sure. How much time?

11:07.457 --> 11:10.062
I'll call you, okay?

11:11.281 --> 11:13.459
Sure.

11:49.209 --> 11:51.617
United States Capitol.
How may I direct your call?

11:51.680 --> 11:53.282
Congressional offices, please.

11:53.356 --> 11:55.417
Hold, please.

12:35.418 --> 12:37.658
Hey, Beckett.
What are you doing here?

12:37.747 --> 12:39.188
I didn't think you were
back till next week.

12:39.261 --> 12:40.872
Yeah, well, two months
of listening to crickets

12:40.931 --> 12:42.200
in my dad's cabin...

12:42.273 --> 12:44.315
was driving me nuts.

12:44.412 --> 12:47.070
It's okay.
You don't have to make excuses.

12:47.145 --> 12:49.703
We know you missed us.
That's why you couldn't stay away.

12:49.786 --> 12:51.693
Shut up.

12:53.549 --> 12:56.309
So? Anything?

12:56.397 --> 12:58.625
Still nowhere.

13:00.471 --> 13:02.388
Well, what about
the groundskeeper?

13:02.456 --> 13:03.810
The guy's a ghost.

13:03.891 --> 13:07.051
We ran face hits on
surveillance, license plates.

13:07.124 --> 13:09.138
Nothing panned out.

13:09.207 --> 13:10.969
We did get DNA Off the weapon,

13:11.037 --> 13:13.035
but there were no
matches in the system.

13:13.124 --> 13:13.939
We flagged it, though.

13:13.986 --> 13:16.866
Uh, didn't Castle tell
you about all this?

13:16.935 --> 13:18.302
No.

13:18.370 --> 13:20.180
That's weird. Why wouldn't he--why
would he hide that from you?

13:20.229 --> 13:23.465
He's not hiding anything.
I just haven't see him in a while.

13:23.534 --> 13:25.133
How long is a while?

13:25.196 --> 13:26.765
Pretty much since the shooting.

13:26.839 --> 13:27.642
Why? What happened?

13:27.706 --> 13:29.982
Nothing happened.
I just needed some time.

13:30.068 --> 13:31.720
What, he left you alone
for three months?

13:31.793 --> 13:32.921
You guys, it wasn't his fault.

13:32.975 --> 13:34.610
I told him that I would call.

13:34.659 --> 13:36.865
Well, why didn't you?

13:38.193 --> 13:39.037
He was here with us every day,

13:39.102 --> 13:40.792
working the case,

13:40.861 --> 13:42.346
for months.

13:42.424 --> 13:43.046
He'd still be here

13:43.101 --> 13:45.869
if the new captain hadn't
kicked him to the curb.

13:46.362 --> 13:47.840
She kicked him out? Why?

13:47.911 --> 13:50.207
Apparently, uh, her precinct's

13:50.276 --> 13:52.548
got no room for a
dilettante writer

13:52.607 --> 13:54.269
playing cop.

13:54.328 --> 13:56.131
Captain Victoria Gates,

13:56.205 --> 13:58.772
a.k.a. Iron Gates.

13:58.836 --> 14:00.217
As by-the-book as they come.

14:00.281 --> 14:02.817
She cut her teeth as a detective
with Internal Affairs.

14:02.880 --> 14:05.180
Wow. That's not gonna win
her any popularity points.

14:05.236 --> 14:07.898
Yeah. It's like she brought her
distrust of cops along with her.

14:07.953 --> 14:10.192
Well, one thing's for sure,
she's no Montgomery.

14:10.257 --> 14:12.072
Hey, she hasn't talked to Castle.

14:12.128 --> 14:14.298
She doesn't know about the bank yet.
What bank?

14:14.339 --> 14:16.874
Uh, well, we weren't getting
any traction with the shooter,

14:16.932 --> 14:18.669
so Castle suggested we check out

14:18.738 --> 14:20.404
Montgomery, McCallister
and Raglan.

14:20.448 --> 14:22.228
See who they might have been in
business with back in the day.

14:22.302 --> 14:24.371
We know those guys were getting
fat ransoming wise guys.

14:24.446 --> 14:25.757
Maybe they used that stash

14:25.826 --> 14:27.627
to pay off the guy that
ordered your mother's murder.

14:27.696 --> 14:29.661
Yeah, so Castle thinks he
found the bank they used.

14:29.734 --> 14:30.882
So there's a money trail.

14:30.942 --> 14:33.636
The only problem is,
the bank closed down.

14:33.699 --> 14:35.821
No one knows where those
old records ended up.

14:35.879 --> 14:36.701
We were working to locate them

14:36.765 --> 14:39.695
when Iron Gates shut
down the investigation.

14:39.763 --> 14:42.198
W--she shut the case down? Why?

14:42.261 --> 14:43.772
No new leads on the shooter.

14:43.823 --> 14:45.423
And we couldn't tell
her the rest of it

14:45.476 --> 14:48.556
without implicating
captain Montgomery.

14:50.794 --> 14:51.363
Ma'am.

14:51.436 --> 14:53.510
If my mother drops by,
you can call her ma'am.

14:53.587 --> 14:56.487
Call me sir or captain.

14:56.546 --> 14:57.967
Detective Beckett.

14:58.030 --> 14:59.977
Back on active as of today.

15:00.041 --> 15:01.200
Detective Beckett.

15:01.398 --> 15:03.015
Your reputation precedes you.

15:03.052 --> 15:05.811
Youngest woman in the
NYPD to make detective.

15:05.812 --> 15:07.310
You beat me by six weeks.

15:08.268 --> 15:10.387
I didn't realize that
people kept score.

15:10.688 --> 15:12.739
Everybody keeps score, detective,

15:12.856 --> 15:14.611
especially those downtown.

15:15.560 --> 15:17.040
Looks like you passed
your psych eval,

15:17.041 --> 15:18.614
so, uh, welcome back.

15:18.615 --> 15:21.267
Thank you.
Uh, I-I'll also need my gun.

15:21.383 --> 15:22.854
Not until you requalify.

15:22.974 --> 15:23.925
I'm sorry?

15:25.149 --> 15:27.272
You were on disability
for three months.

15:27.399 --> 15:29.093
Regs says you don't
get your piece back

15:29.094 --> 15:30.481
until you requalify.

15:32.564 --> 15:34.750
And what about my case?
What do regs say about that?

15:35.556 --> 15:36.767
Three months and no leads,

15:36.768 --> 15:39.245
and every day, more homicides
coming through that door?

15:39.246 --> 15:42.598
How long did you expect me to
let those folks tread water?

15:42.788 --> 15:44.502
There were good
people on this case.

15:44.613 --> 15:45.970
There just isn't
anything out there--

15:45.971 --> 15:48.768
I'm sorry, sir, but with all due
respect, those people aren't me.

15:49.932 --> 15:50.899
Excuse me?

15:50.900 --> 15:53.783
The people that you had working
this case, they're not me.

15:56.436 --> 15:58.212
Look, I don't know
what kind of shop

15:58.213 --> 15:59.595
Montgomery was running here,

15:59.596 --> 16:02.515
but it'll be a cold day in
hell if I let a cop--any cop--

16:02.516 --> 16:04.112
investigate their own shooting.

16:04.332 --> 16:06.439
My precinct is no
place for vendettas.

16:08.220 --> 16:09.719
Do we understand each other?

16:14.371 --> 16:16.406
I want my gun.

16:17.757 --> 16:19.086
So you gotta requalify.

16:19.284 --> 16:21.917
It's no big deal.
It is a little insulting, but--

16:21.918 --> 16:23.687
Where are the files
on the money trail?

16:23.901 --> 16:25.132
Castle's got 'em.

16:26.505 --> 16:28.525
What were we supposed to
do, leave 'em here so...

16:29.378 --> 16:31.388
Gates could find 'em?

16:31.635 --> 16:32.877
First thing she would do

16:32.955 --> 16:34.594
Is open an investigation
of Montgomery.

16:34.595 --> 16:36.537
Mm-hmm.
You want to see the files,

16:36.538 --> 16:37.674
you're gonna have to talk to him.

16:37.675 --> 16:39.716
Whatever you do,
don't get caught.

16:39.762 --> 16:40.442
Oh, come on.

16:40.443 --> 16:42.224
What's she gonna do, bust
me down to traffic?

16:42.279 --> 16:43.170
Worse.

16:43.850 --> 16:45.082
It's not like it was before.

16:45.083 --> 16:46.521
We go against her orders on this,

16:46.522 --> 16:47.941
we could all lose our badges.

16:47.994 --> 16:48.948
Yeah, Ryan.

16:49.554 --> 16:50.565
Yeah, what do you got?

16:51.771 --> 16:53.475
He is paranoid...

16:53.926 --> 16:54.721
but right.

16:55.157 --> 16:56.080
Well, then...

16:56.357 --> 16:57.965
I guess I better not get caught.

16:58.627 --> 16:59.413
Hey.

16:59.923 --> 17:01.774
We got a fresh one. 18th and Lex.

17:07.589 --> 17:08.415
You coming?

17:08.636 --> 17:10.838
No. I think I'm gonna
sit this one out.

17:16.565 --> 17:17.535
If she keeps looking into this,

17:17.536 --> 17:18.755
we could all lose our jobs.

17:18.756 --> 17:19.795
What about her life?

17:19.796 --> 17:20.816
The shooter's still out there.

17:21.211 --> 17:22.781
How's she supposed
to live like that?

17:23.748 --> 17:25.609
Hmm. Someone had a party.

17:25.784 --> 17:28.002
Victim is Sonya Gilbert, 27.

17:28.192 --> 17:29.354
This is her place.

17:29.368 --> 17:30.498
Sonya Gilbert?

17:31.280 --> 17:33.381
As in paparazzi-favorite
party girl?

17:33.576 --> 17:35.695
Multiple GSWs to the chest.

17:35.696 --> 17:38.231
The killer used the pillow
as a poor-man's suppressor.

17:38.232 --> 17:39.649
Gunshots to the chest, huh?

17:40.016 --> 17:41.452
Good thing Beckett
sat this one out.

17:41.453 --> 17:43.041
Beckett's back? Yeah.

17:44.096 --> 17:46.252
She hasn't called you either?
Not for weeks.

17:46.468 --> 17:48.585
Victim's sister found
her an hour ago.

17:48.928 --> 17:50.498
They were supposed to
go shopping today.

17:50.572 --> 17:52.981
Alarm system was activated
around 10:00 last night,

17:52.982 --> 17:54.348
right after the victim
and her boyfriend

17:54.349 --> 17:55.416
were seen returning home.

17:55.417 --> 17:57.677
It wasn't deactivated till
9:00 am this morning.

17:57.678 --> 18:00.182
Boyfriend was spotted leaving
the apartment right after that.

18:00.183 --> 18:00.973
Time of death?

18:00.974 --> 18:02.626
Between 3:00 and 4:00 am.

18:02.627 --> 18:03.717
This boyfriend have a name?

18:03.718 --> 18:06.161
Vic's sister identified
him as a Dale Landers.

18:06.303 --> 18:07.813
Mm. Drummer from
particle equation.

18:07.814 --> 18:09.239
They've been dating
for six months.

18:09.262 --> 18:10.808
"People" magazine. What?

18:11.645 --> 18:14.168
Get a unit to his last known
and get an APB Out.

18:15.638 --> 18:17.957
Dead celebutante,
heavy-metal drummer--

18:17.958 --> 18:19.384
Castle would've loved this one.

18:19.463 --> 18:21.106
Hey, you think maybe Beckett
can talk the new captain

18:21.107 --> 18:21.964
into bringing him back?

18:21.965 --> 18:23.109
She left him hanging
for three months.

18:23.110 --> 18:24.678
What makes you think he's
gonna want to come back?

18:25.337 --> 18:27.125
Well, that makes you
my favorite fan.

18:28.530 --> 18:29.604
Thanks.

18:29.778 --> 18:30.620
Thanks.

18:33.314 --> 18:35.491
I can't believe I'm
meeting you right now.

18:35.713 --> 18:37.035
You're my favorite author.

18:37.522 --> 18:39.084
Thank you for coming out.

18:42.138 --> 18:43.569
How are you? Hi there.

18:43.570 --> 18:45.349
Who should I make it out to?
And your name is?

18:45.354 --> 18:46.954
And your name is? Sure can.

18:46.955 --> 18:48.129
How you doing?
How are you?

18:48.130 --> 18:48.922
Thanks for coming.
And your name is?

18:48.923 --> 18:50.162
And who should I make it out to?

18:52.008 --> 18:52.826
Kate.

18:55.982 --> 18:57.281
You can make it out to Kate.

19:02.436 --> 19:04.133
Thank you very much.
Thank you very much for the hard work.

19:04.134 --> 19:05.774
Next time I write a book,
I'll be sure to come by.

19:05.940 --> 19:06.821
Thanks very much.

19:10.777 --> 19:11.656
Castle, wait.

19:11.657 --> 19:13.307
I did, three months.
You never called.

19:13.308 --> 19:14.518
Look, I know you're angry--

19:14.519 --> 19:15.958
Oh, you're damn right I'm angry.

19:16.987 --> 19:18.768
I watched you die
in that ambulance.

19:18.769 --> 19:19.636
Did you know that?

19:20.258 --> 19:21.348
You know what that's like,

19:22.026 --> 19:23.932
watching the life drain
out of someone you...

19:25.530 --> 19:26.708
someone you care about?

19:27.922 --> 19:29.033
I told you, I needed some time.

19:29.034 --> 19:31.232
You said a few days.
Well, I needed more.

19:31.233 --> 19:32.507
Well, you shoulda said that.

19:32.722 --> 19:34.493
Castle, look, I
couldn't call you.

19:35.044 --> 19:37.172
Okay? Not without
dragging myself into...

19:37.699 --> 19:40.651
everything that I was just
trying to get some space from.

19:40.857 --> 19:43.299
I needed some time to just
work through everything.

19:43.498 --> 19:44.835
Josh help you with that?

19:46.474 --> 19:47.459
We broke up.

20:00.489 --> 20:01.683
I like the dedication.

20:02.898 --> 20:03.811
It seemed right.

20:05.266 --> 20:06.992
It must have been hard,
writing that ending.

20:08.382 --> 20:09.817
Yeah. Yeah.

20:09.818 --> 20:11.425
Given the circumstances, yeah.

20:14.216 --> 20:15.637
So why'd you guys break up?

20:17.376 --> 20:18.874
I really, really liked him.

20:21.904 --> 20:23.002
But that wasn't enough.

20:28.793 --> 20:30.178
After my mother was killed,

20:30.416 --> 20:32.050
something inside me changed.

20:32.760 --> 20:35.258
It's like I built up
this wall inside.

20:37.080 --> 20:40.199
I don't know. I guess I just didn't
want to hurt like that again.

20:43.041 --> 20:45.625
I know I'm not gonna be able
to be the kind of person

20:45.626 --> 20:46.529
that I want to be,

20:46.530 --> 20:47.796
I know I'm not gonna...

20:52.186 --> 20:53.245
I'm not gonna be able to have

20:53.246 --> 20:55.700
the kind of relationship
that I want...

20:57.386 --> 20:58.844
Until that wall comes down.

21:01.082 --> 21:02.558
And it's not gonna happen

21:02.851 --> 21:04.352
till I put this thing to rest.

21:13.802 --> 21:15.587
Well, then I suppose we're
just gonna have to...

21:16.417 --> 21:18.059
find these guys and
take 'em down.

21:20.361 --> 21:21.787
That doesn't mean
I'm not still mad.

21:22.258 --> 21:23.764
The boys told me
about what you did,

21:24.058 --> 21:25.356
following the money trail,

21:25.730 --> 21:27.505
trying to track down
who the cops paid off.

21:27.506 --> 21:28.957
I just wish it led somewhere.

21:29.170 --> 21:31.569
I mean, I found their files.
When the bank closed,

21:31.570 --> 21:33.163
they took all the dead
account paperwork

21:33.164 --> 21:36.325
and stored it in a
warehouse in union city,

21:36.331 --> 21:38.144
but a couple years
after the move,

21:38.145 --> 21:40.209
a fire broke out, and the
files were destroyed.

21:40.210 --> 21:41.500
It's just another dead end.

21:41.682 --> 21:42.540
How'd it happen?

21:43.033 --> 21:44.539
It was an accident.
It was old wiring.

21:44.707 --> 21:45.557
Are you sure?

21:45.677 --> 21:47.130
Yeah, there was an investigation.

21:47.131 --> 21:49.920
Well, did you see the report
from the fire investigator?

21:49.921 --> 21:51.421
No, but...

21:53.058 --> 21:54.361
really, a warehouse fire?

21:54.362 --> 21:56.608
Seems an awful lot of trouble
just for a couple of files.

21:56.609 --> 21:59.041
That's no more trouble than
they've already gone through.

21:59.042 --> 22:00.764
I mean, we have to
read that report.

22:01.617 --> 22:03.084
It's just, there's
this one problem.

22:03.826 --> 22:04.628
What?

22:05.778 --> 22:08.084
How are you gonna help
if gates kicked you out?

22:08.618 --> 22:10.088
I only let her kick me out

22:10.089 --> 22:11.899
Because there was
no reason to stay.

22:11.953 --> 22:14.692
Oh. She'll take me back.

22:15.579 --> 22:17.818
And I want Castle back at the precinct.
Y-yes, Mr. Mayor.

22:17.926 --> 22:20.197
Yes, sir. I understand.
Today. No more discussion.

22:20.198 --> 22:21.178
Okay. I--

22:24.789 --> 22:26.255
You think you're clever, Mr.
Castle,

22:26.485 --> 22:28.119
going around my back like that?

22:28.222 --> 22:29.640
Well, let me tell you the score.

22:29.758 --> 22:32.361
I don't care how powerful
your friends are,

22:32.438 --> 22:34.717
you screw up at all on my watch,

22:34.718 --> 22:37.368
and I'll prosecute you to the
fullest extent of the law.

22:37.485 --> 22:39.684
You understand me?
Yes, ma'am.

22:39.685 --> 22:40.951
Sir.
Sir.

22:41.262 --> 22:42.480
Now get out of my office.

22:46.230 --> 22:47.112
Detective.

22:47.342 --> 22:48.153
Yes.

22:48.166 --> 22:49.145
You...

22:49.630 --> 22:51.208
or that pal there

22:51.262 --> 22:52.761
embarrass me like that again,

22:53.286 --> 22:54.352
I will bury you.

22:56.453 --> 22:57.527
Yes, sir.

22:58.310 --> 22:59.335
Now, um,

23:00.574 --> 23:01.448
if you don't mind...

23:03.566 --> 23:04.704
I'd like my gun back.

23:17.231 --> 23:18.869
Showing her up with the mayor?

23:18.870 --> 23:21.270
You might as well have
beaten a beehive with a bat.

23:21.271 --> 23:22.325
Well, it worked, didn't it?

23:22.326 --> 23:23.477
Besides, it sure was great

23:23.478 --> 23:25.023
seeing her face twitch like that.

23:25.894 --> 23:26.839
Sonya Gilbert?

23:26.877 --> 23:28.847
Yep. Guns, drugs, and
love gone wrong.

23:29.134 --> 23:30.254
Where are you with the boyfriend?

23:30.255 --> 23:31.851
APB's out, but he
hasn't been home

23:31.852 --> 23:34.642
and none of his bandmates know where he is.
What was his motive?

23:34.643 --> 23:36.867
The usual.
He and the vic had been fighting.

23:37.041 --> 23:39.068
He was in love, she wanted out.

23:39.385 --> 23:40.305
Psst.

23:40.817 --> 23:41.588
Beckett.

23:45.002 --> 23:46.453
I pulled the report on
the fire from records.

23:46.922 --> 23:47.772
Check the date.

23:49.113 --> 23:52.160
That warehouse burned down three
weeks after my mom's murder.

23:52.161 --> 23:53.380
That can't be a coincidence.

23:53.410 --> 23:55.035
Someone was destroying evidence.

23:55.313 --> 23:56.993
Evidence that could lead
to your mom's killers.

23:56.994 --> 23:59.353
But the investigator
ruled it an accident.

23:59.354 --> 24:01.076
And there's nothing in
there to suggest arson.

24:01.274 --> 24:02.524
Maybe someone altered it.

24:02.595 --> 24:03.768
There's an easy way to find out.

24:03.769 --> 24:06.179
Just ask the man who wrote
the report--Rod Halstead.

24:06.225 --> 24:07.520
Unless they got to him, too.

24:07.521 --> 24:09.379
No. He's alive and on the job.

24:10.081 --> 24:11.712
Now get your ass over
there and find something

24:11.713 --> 24:13.094
we can use to reopen
the investigation.

24:13.095 --> 24:14.697
Ryan! Esposito!

24:16.277 --> 24:17.334
Yeah, we were just...

24:17.797 --> 24:18.735
yeah, we were just getting
a drink of water.

24:18.736 --> 24:20.849
Yeah, is that thing broken? I just--
Saddle up.

24:20.850 --> 24:22.480
We just got a hit on the APB.

24:22.685 --> 24:24.627
A beat cop IDed
Sonya Gilbert's boyfriend

24:24.628 --> 24:26.459
heading into the band's
rehearsal garage

24:26.460 --> 24:28.997
on the lower east side.
You, too, Beckett!

24:32.123 --> 24:33.069
Hide this.

24:44.971 --> 24:46.972
Hey, you ready for this?

24:47.235 --> 24:48.166
You're kidding, right?

24:50.137 --> 24:51.996
Okay. But we got point.

24:52.059 --> 24:52.868
Let's go.

25:00.081 --> 25:01.393
What the hell were you thinking,

25:01.394 --> 25:02.326
coming here, Dale, huh?

25:02.327 --> 25:04.881
Please, bro! I just need some
money to get outta town.

25:06.734 --> 25:07.384
NYPD!

25:07.385 --> 25:09.153
NYPD! Let me see your
hands right now!

25:09.452 --> 25:10.786
Let me see 'em!
Down!

25:10.787 --> 25:12.523
Let me see 'em!
Show me-- Landers, don't do it!

25:13.006 --> 25:15.036
Stop!
Put 'em in the air. Come on!

25:15.037 --> 25:16.111
Get on the ground.

25:19.810 --> 25:20.645
No.

25:36.889 --> 25:38.281
Drop it or I'll drop you!
Drop it now!

25:38.282 --> 25:39.576
Okay, okay, okay!

25:39.577 --> 25:41.577
Drop it right now!
On the ground!

25:41.578 --> 25:43.204
Get on the ground!
Down!

25:43.314 --> 25:44.109
Don't move.

25:45.405 --> 25:46.977
The same caliber that
killed Sonya Gilbert.

25:46.978 --> 25:48.220
Hey, it's not my gun, man.

25:48.346 --> 25:50.652
I swear. It's not my gun.

26:01.676 --> 26:03.133
Sit your ass down in that chair.

26:03.134 --> 26:04.674
Why don't we start
with why you ran?

26:04.797 --> 26:07.203
Or maybe why you were pointing
a gun at a police officer.

26:07.204 --> 26:08.903
Or maybe...
you want to talk about it?

26:09.276 --> 26:11.322
About what? Kate, I saw you.

26:11.323 --> 26:12.621
So what happened that night?

26:12.635 --> 26:14.189
When you saw that gun, you froze.

26:15.301 --> 26:16.090
It's nothing.

26:16.291 --> 26:18.149
Your hand was shaking.
That's not nothing.

26:18.210 --> 26:19.940
Castle, it's my second day back.

26:19.970 --> 26:22.156
That's all. It's no big deal.

26:23.115 --> 26:24.260
And if it happens again?

26:24.426 --> 26:25.196
It won't.

26:27.450 --> 26:28.547
Where are you going?

26:29.417 --> 26:30.900
Find out who burned
down that warehouse.

26:31.585 --> 26:32.772
Find out who killed my mom.

26:37.339 --> 26:39.837
Come on, Dale.
We know you killed her.

26:39.843 --> 26:40.836
Just tell us why,

26:40.873 --> 26:42.561
and we'll tell the DA
that you cooperated.

26:42.562 --> 26:43.577
The gun's a match, Dale.

26:43.578 --> 26:46.033
I told you, it's not mine.
Then why were you holding it?

26:46.034 --> 26:48.216
We have witnesses who saw
you enter her apartment

26:48.217 --> 26:48.920
and then leave.

26:48.943 --> 26:50.825
Yeah, that's right.
I-I was there, okay?

26:50.826 --> 26:51.757
And then...

26:52.491 --> 26:54.946
Look, man, I-I don't know.
I-I-I crashed.

26:54.947 --> 26:56.466
And when I woke up, there
was all this blood

26:56.467 --> 26:57.625
and--and this was in my hand.

26:57.626 --> 27:00.121
So what are you saying,
Dale, you sleep shot her?

27:00.122 --> 27:01.211
Is that your defense?

27:01.826 --> 27:02.564
No.

27:03.386 --> 27:05.172
Look, I--I'm saying,
it wasn't me.

27:06.850 --> 27:08.837
So... you went to bed

27:09.339 --> 27:10.817
and you slept through
your girlfriend's murder?

27:10.818 --> 27:12.331
Six shots?

27:12.922 --> 27:14.379
You must be a heavy sleeper.

27:16.393 --> 27:18.524
Motive, opportunity,
possession of the weapon.

27:18.594 --> 27:20.315
Looks like a murder-one trifecta.

27:20.454 --> 27:21.690
His bandmate, Mitch Yancey there,

27:21.691 --> 27:22.259
said he was looking for

27:22.260 --> 27:24.247
some money to get out of town.
I don't know...

27:24.248 --> 27:25.878
All right, contact
the DA's office.

27:25.879 --> 27:28.031
Have them file charges,
and let the family know.

27:28.102 --> 27:28.919
Yes, sir.

27:29.302 --> 27:31.195
Where did Castle and
Beckett go off to?

27:32.263 --> 27:33.620
They, uh...

27:34.031 --> 27:36.112
they had another lead
they were looking into.

27:36.117 --> 27:37.079
Another lead?

27:37.517 --> 27:38.552
You caught the guy.

27:39.350 --> 27:41.488
Yeah, they were double-checking
eyewitness accounts.

27:41.662 --> 27:43.213
Since it's a high-profile case,

27:43.214 --> 27:45.280
Beckett wants to make sure that
we don't make any mistakes.

27:45.869 --> 27:47.638
Well, that's good to hear,
'cause we wouldn't want her

27:47.639 --> 27:49.245
making any mistakes,
now would we?

27:56.813 --> 27:58.719
Warehouse in Union City?

27:59.030 --> 28:00.472
Yeah, yeah, I remember this fire.

28:01.189 --> 28:02.879
The report said it
was an accident.

28:03.157 --> 28:04.120
Yeah, that's right.

28:05.054 --> 28:07.064
And you're sure?
Yeah, I'm sure.

28:07.703 --> 28:10.054
And this report hasn't
been altered in any way

28:10.055 --> 28:11.096
since you filed it?

28:12.639 --> 28:13.692
No. Why?

28:13.693 --> 28:15.301
Mr. Halstead, this
is very important.

28:15.302 --> 28:18.079
Was there anything that you
didn't put in that report?

28:18.318 --> 28:19.232
What do you mean?

28:19.270 --> 28:22.128
Anything that might indicate
suspicious activity.

28:22.374 --> 28:24.229
Well, if there was
anything suspicious,

28:24.230 --> 28:25.960
detective, it'd be in the report.

28:26.622 --> 28:28.341
Power surge to the junction box--

28:28.342 --> 28:29.719
one-in-a-million event.

28:30.189 --> 28:30.869
Thanks.

28:30.870 --> 28:33.220
So at no point did
anyone pressure you

28:33.221 --> 28:35.797
into keeping some information
out of that report?

28:35.798 --> 28:37.452
You are way outta line here.

28:37.453 --> 28:40.053
I'm out of line?
I'm not the one who falsified that report.

28:40.054 --> 28:40.947
Beckett-- get out of my station.

28:40.948 --> 28:43.288
Who set that fire?
Who had you cover it up?

28:43.289 --> 28:44.315
Get out!
Okay.

28:44.316 --> 28:46.721
You tell them that I'm
coming after them!

28:46.722 --> 28:48.700
And you tell them
that I'll find them!

28:50.882 --> 28:52.196
What the hell are you doing?

28:52.298 --> 28:53.188
He's lying.

28:53.257 --> 28:54.323
You don't know that.

28:54.634 --> 28:55.516
Yes, I do.

28:56.986 --> 28:57.924
Esposito.

28:58.809 --> 29:00.313
I need you to get me
everything you can

29:00.314 --> 29:01.478
on Rod Halstead.

29:02.954 --> 29:04.233
Yeah, and send it
to my apartment.

29:04.234 --> 29:06.036
I don't need Gates looking
over my shoulder.

29:08.134 --> 29:08.863
You got it.

29:09.261 --> 29:10.182
That was Beckett.

29:10.748 --> 29:11.933
How'd it go with Halstead?

29:13.220 --> 29:15.980
She wants to pull some files.
He cut a deal yet?

29:15.981 --> 29:16.766
Nope.

29:18.404 --> 29:19.558
You know what I don't get?

29:19.835 --> 29:20.637
What's that?

29:20.652 --> 29:22.115
Our time of death
is around 3:00 am.

29:22.116 --> 29:23.494
Now if Dale's our shooter,

29:24.420 --> 29:26.572
why'd he hang around
for another six hours

29:26.573 --> 29:28.278
after he shot Sonya?

29:28.596 --> 29:29.558
Likes to cuddle.

29:29.948 --> 29:31.906
I don't know. It's not like
blowing away your girlfriend

29:31.907 --> 29:33.341
is a rational act to begin with.

29:34.077 --> 29:34.891
Why?

29:34.947 --> 29:37.141
If I'm asking the question,
the jury's gonna be, too.

29:40.428 --> 29:42.702
This guy's got multiple
citations for valor,

29:42.767 --> 29:44.093
commendations from the mayor,

29:44.094 --> 29:46.807
He's literally saved dozens of
people from burning buildings.

29:46.822 --> 29:48.211
It's hard to believe
this guy's dirty.

29:48.212 --> 29:49.942
Yeah. Well, we've been
surprised before.

29:51.452 --> 29:52.230
Okay.

29:52.340 --> 29:53.318
Um...

29:54.756 --> 29:57.422
Does he intersect with
anyone else in the case--

29:57.453 --> 29:59.058
uh, Montgomery,
Raglan, McCallister?

29:59.112 --> 30:01.544
No, there's nothing in the files.

30:02.200 --> 30:03.406
Might have known them socially.

30:03.407 --> 30:05.611
But we've been over their
lives with a fine-tooth comb.

30:05.612 --> 30:06.793
He's never come up once.

30:06.794 --> 30:08.760
Okay, so maybe he was a
target of opportunity.

30:08.761 --> 30:09.970
He might have needed the money.

30:09.984 --> 30:12.108
Nothing in his financial records
to indicate any problems,

30:12.109 --> 30:13.871
and given his record, he's...

30:16.788 --> 30:17.973
Given his record, what?

30:18.986 --> 30:21.032
I'm just saying, what
if he's not our guy?

30:21.258 --> 30:23.464
What if the fire was an accident?

30:23.465 --> 30:25.613
It wasn't an accident.
I know it wasn't an accident.

30:25.614 --> 30:26.772
You can't know that.
I can,

30:26.773 --> 30:28.532
because if this was an accident,

30:28.533 --> 30:30.856
Then I've got nowhere to start.

30:30.857 --> 30:33.682
If this was an accident,
then I've got nothing.

30:34.141 --> 30:36.256
The guy who shot me is gone.

30:36.289 --> 30:37.764
Dick Coonan--gone.

30:37.765 --> 30:38.910
Hal Lockwood--gone.

30:38.911 --> 30:40.135
Montgomery--gone.

30:40.136 --> 30:43.392
My mom-- everybody
is gone, Castle.

31:09.099 --> 31:10.358
Missed you for dinner tonight.

31:13.909 --> 31:15.877
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.
I was working.

31:17.207 --> 31:18.218
You were with Beckett.

31:18.372 --> 31:19.182
Yeah.

31:20.040 --> 31:21.731
I thought you said you
weren't going back.

31:22.250 --> 31:23.182
I'm not.

31:24.259 --> 31:26.302
Look, I'm not.
It's just this one case.

31:26.303 --> 31:28.032
Yeah, well, there's
leftovers in the fridge.

31:34.149 --> 31:34.828
Hello.

31:34.829 --> 31:35.974
Mr. Castle.
Yeah.

31:36.680 --> 31:38.284
I'm a friend of roy Montgomery's.

31:39.853 --> 31:41.659
I'm calling about
detective Beckett.

31:43.272 --> 31:44.399
We need to talk.

31:47.627 --> 31:49.368
Do you have any idea who he was?

31:49.369 --> 31:51.290
Just that he's a friend
of Montgomery's,

31:51.604 --> 31:53.232
that he owed Montgomery his life.

31:54.347 --> 31:56.968
He said Montgomery
sent him some files--

31:56.969 --> 31:59.066
files that, if they ever got out,

32:00.246 --> 32:01.880
could hurt some very
powerful people.

32:02.919 --> 32:05.181
They were using those
files as a threat

32:05.182 --> 32:08.412
to keep Montgomery's family
from every being harmed.

32:08.584 --> 32:10.465
Beckett's safety was
also part of the deal.

32:10.466 --> 32:12.033
But they went after her anyway.

32:12.285 --> 32:14.295
He didn't get the files
until after she was shot.

32:14.296 --> 32:14.947
Oh.

32:14.948 --> 32:16.462
He says she's safe now...

32:16.719 --> 32:17.888
on one condition.

32:19.780 --> 32:20.979
She can't go near the case.

32:22.061 --> 32:24.871
If she does, he can't
guarantee her safety.

32:24.938 --> 32:27.432
If she digs, they will kill her.

32:27.433 --> 32:29.057
And this man, you believe him?

32:29.209 --> 32:30.855
I do.
Then you have to tell her.

32:30.856 --> 32:33.142
If I do that, she'll
put on blinders

32:33.143 --> 32:34.649
and run out into
the line of fire.

32:34.650 --> 32:35.635
I can't let that happen.

32:35.636 --> 32:37.525
You are not going to
change her, Richard.

32:37.526 --> 32:38.717
She's gonna keep going out there

32:38.718 --> 32:40.221
and she's gonna keep digging.

32:40.222 --> 32:41.185
Not if stop her.

32:42.031 --> 32:43.205
She'll listen to me.

32:43.897 --> 32:45.110
I can steer her away.

32:45.279 --> 32:46.325
For how long?

32:47.515 --> 32:48.956
I'm not gonna lose her again.

32:54.041 --> 32:56.085
So I guess it's not just
for this case, is it?

32:59.221 --> 33:00.292
How much did you hear?

33:00.742 --> 33:01.824
Enough.

33:03.992 --> 33:06.868
Look, it's really important
you don't say anything.

33:06.869 --> 33:08.230
All right? Especially to Beckett.

33:08.231 --> 33:09.613
You act like this
is all about her,

33:09.614 --> 33:11.545
but you were standing
right next to her.

33:11.567 --> 33:13.894
You could've been shot.
Hell, I could've been shot.

33:13.927 --> 33:17.083
That's why I have to do this,
to make sure they stay away.

33:17.084 --> 33:18.005
Yeah?

33:18.290 --> 33:19.678
You need to grow up, dad.

33:20.446 --> 33:22.195
You're a writer, not a cop.

33:23.129 --> 33:24.616
Stop pretending.

33:39.692 --> 33:40.518
Thanks.

33:49.678 --> 33:51.830
Do you remember what you told me

33:51.831 --> 33:53.896
the first time I brought
up your mother's case?

33:54.796 --> 33:57.476
That if you got started
again, you wouldn't stop.

33:58.730 --> 34:00.058
You said it would
probably destroy you.

34:00.059 --> 34:02.055
Yeah, well, I didn't
have any leads then.

34:02.239 --> 34:03.485
We don't have any now.

34:04.754 --> 34:05.514
Look, Castle,

34:05.515 --> 34:07.732
I got a little
emotional last night.

34:07.733 --> 34:08.645
I'm...

34:10.393 --> 34:11.310
I'm fine.

34:11.551 --> 34:12.614
No, you're not.

34:14.266 --> 34:15.553
And you know you're not.

34:17.514 --> 34:18.417
You've been back here three days.

34:18.418 --> 34:19.572
You're already in a freefall.

34:20.710 --> 34:21.985
I'm not telling you to walk away.

34:21.987 --> 34:25.731
I'm just saying... give it time.

34:25.975 --> 34:27.647
You know, just until you
get your bearings again.

34:27.744 --> 34:29.266
How am I supposed
to get my bearings

34:29.266 --> 34:31.099
when someone out
there wants me dead?

34:31.100 --> 34:33.541
By not letting them
rob you of your life.

34:35.045 --> 34:36.039
I promise you,

34:36.040 --> 34:37.310
we will figure this out.

34:37.782 --> 34:38.639
We're gonna find them

34:38.641 --> 34:40.042
and we're gonna make them pay.

34:41.956 --> 34:43.237
Just not today.

34:50.233 --> 34:53.053
Castle, if I don't do this,
I don't know who I am.

34:53.641 --> 34:55.168
You're who you always were.

34:57.227 --> 34:59.303
You're the one who
honors the victims.

35:00.117 --> 35:01.970
You're the one who can bring

35:01.971 --> 35:04.231
Sonya's family some peace.

35:11.135 --> 35:12.155
Hey.

35:14.533 --> 35:15.462
Anything?

35:15.584 --> 35:17.884
According to the DA,
we just turned a slam-dunk case

35:17.885 --> 35:18.936
into a hail mary.

35:19.135 --> 35:20.903
Yeah, super cop over
here had to keep digging

35:20.904 --> 35:23.030
so, you know...
And?

35:24.226 --> 35:26.992
CSU found trace residual
of, uh, barbiturates

35:26.993 --> 35:27.963
in the vodka glasses,

35:27.964 --> 35:29.703
which means Dale and
Sonya were both roofied

35:29.704 --> 35:31.196
when they got back
to the apartment.

35:31.584 --> 35:34.533
Well, it still could have
been the boyfriend, right?

35:34.534 --> 35:36.307
I mean, he could've
meant to roofie her,

35:36.308 --> 35:39.136
but roofied them both instead,
not that that makes any sense.

35:39.137 --> 35:40.597
But what other
explanation is there?

35:40.598 --> 35:42.548
There was no one else
in the apartment,

35:42.549 --> 35:43.785
and according to the
security system,

35:43.786 --> 35:45.794
no one else entered
or left the apartment

35:45.795 --> 35:47.651
between 10:00 pm and 9:00 am.

35:47.945 --> 35:50.028
Which means the boyfriend has
to be the shooter.

35:50.029 --> 35:51.112
Unless...

35:51.113 --> 35:52.394
Unless what?

35:54.092 --> 35:55.825
The killer was in the
apartment the whole time.

35:57.117 --> 35:58.249
When they came home,

35:58.791 --> 36:00.454
they thought they were alone.

36:00.455 --> 36:02.484
Meanwhile, while they're
out of the room,

36:02.485 --> 36:05.485
the killer... slips out,
spikes their drinks,

36:05.486 --> 36:07.647
and then slips back into his
hiding place, where he...

36:07.648 --> 36:08.485
Or she...

36:08.486 --> 36:09.672
waits for them to pass out.

36:09.673 --> 36:10.878
Literally lying in wait.

36:10.879 --> 36:11.870
That's creepy.

36:14.662 --> 36:16.489
And then a couple of hours later,

36:16.490 --> 36:18.984
he slips out again,
grabs the pillow,

36:18.985 --> 36:21.090
and bam, and then he...
Or she...

36:21.091 --> 36:23.889
wipes the gun clean and
puts it into Dale's hand.

36:23.890 --> 36:26.415
He wakes up, he panics, he runs.

36:26.910 --> 36:28.571
All the while, our killer...

36:29.490 --> 36:30.978
bides his time,

36:31.004 --> 36:32.621
waiting until the
body is discovered

36:32.622 --> 36:34.377
before he makes his...
Or her...

36:34.378 --> 36:35.917
escape. Gentlemen, would you?

36:37.132 --> 36:39.184
One, two, three.

36:39.921 --> 36:41.959
The bloodstain on the
bottom of the mattress

36:42.138 --> 36:43.520
dripped down onto the carpet.

36:43.619 --> 36:45.609
There's no drip marks
in the middle.

36:45.610 --> 36:46.850
Your light?

36:47.696 --> 36:49.695
Uh-oh.
Fingerprints.

36:50.085 --> 36:51.377
Someone was here.

36:51.543 --> 36:53.459
Looks like they found a
killer hiding place.

36:58.548 --> 36:59.692
Hiding under a bed for hours

36:59.693 --> 37:01.504
while the girl you
just shot bleeds out?

37:01.505 --> 37:03.549
You gotta be one sick bastard
to do something like that.

37:03.679 --> 37:04.814
It's actually pretty clever.

37:04.815 --> 37:05.769
You commit a murder

37:05.770 --> 37:07.798
and frame an innocent man
all at the same time.

37:07.799 --> 37:08.829
And then you get away with it

37:08.830 --> 37:11.476
because the police already
think they have their killer

37:11.477 --> 37:12.686
and no one's looking for you.

37:15.021 --> 37:17.232
Mitch Yancey.
That's Dale's bandmate.

37:17.654 --> 37:18.564
Let's go.

37:27.360 --> 37:28.209
Ryan.

37:28.433 --> 37:29.284
Let's go.

37:32.713 --> 37:33.577
You okay?

37:34.230 --> 37:35.087
Yeah.

37:36.008 --> 37:36.538
I don't even think--

37:36.539 --> 37:37.554
Put your gun down!

37:37.788 --> 37:38.605
Kate!

37:38.751 --> 37:40.171
I said put it down!

37:40.661 --> 37:41.600
Just...

37:42.299 --> 37:44.613
let me walk outta here, okay?
That's all I want.

37:44.673 --> 37:46.389
Don't... don't...

37:46.390 --> 37:48.064
don't move, Mitch!

37:50.194 --> 37:51.811
I'll shoot you. I swear.

37:51.812 --> 37:52.906
Take it easy, Kate.

37:54.576 --> 37:56.390
I just need you to let me go.

37:56.391 --> 37:57.828
Take it easy. You've got this.

37:58.958 --> 38:00.066
You've got this.

38:00.067 --> 38:02.784
Put it down and stay back.
Stay back.

38:04.427 --> 38:06.171
You don't want to
do this, Mitch...

38:08.271 --> 38:09.888
because I will have
to put you down.

38:10.210 --> 38:11.622
Do you understand?

38:14.089 --> 38:16.633
Put that gun down, now.

38:24.489 --> 38:26.173
Turn around.
Hands behind your head.

38:35.202 --> 38:37.059
Mitch Yancey, you're
under arrest.

38:38.642 --> 38:39.163
Turns out Mitch

38:39.164 --> 38:41.043
had been seeing Sonya
secretly for a year,

38:41.113 --> 38:42.706
all the time she was with Dale.

38:42.719 --> 38:44.265
Mitch insisted that
she leave Dale,

38:44.266 --> 38:45.987
but instead, she broke
it off with him.

38:45.988 --> 38:48.130
So this was Mitch's plan
to take care of them both.

38:48.439 --> 38:49.873
He knew Sonya's security code,

38:49.874 --> 38:52.284
but to frame Dale, he knew that
the system couldn't record

38:52.285 --> 38:54.430
anyone else entering or
exiting the apartment

38:54.431 --> 38:55.759
around the time of the murder.

38:55.760 --> 38:57.934
So he used a key that
he'd stolen to slip in

38:57.935 --> 38:59.498
hours earlier in the day.

38:59.639 --> 39:01.683
All right.
Cut the boyfriend loose.

39:01.824 --> 39:04.675
I'll brief the press and let
them know we have a confession.

39:06.174 --> 39:07.327
So how's it feel?

39:09.042 --> 39:10.242
It's not enough.

39:12.554 --> 39:13.731
But it's...

39:13.732 --> 39:14.797
enough for now.

39:17.531 --> 39:19.867
Thank you for having
my back in there.

39:20.332 --> 39:21.522
That's what partners are for.

39:24.949 --> 39:26.138
Oh, and hey...

39:27.397 --> 39:28.567
we'll figure it out.

39:29.273 --> 39:31.816
That wall inside won't
be there forever.

39:53.902 --> 39:54.880
You're right.

39:56.886 --> 39:58.298
I do need to grow up.

40:00.310 --> 40:02.976
And that's why I'm
doing what I'm doing.

40:03.497 --> 40:05.824
Everything that's happened
happened because of me.

40:07.101 --> 40:08.589
And I need to be there for her.

40:08.590 --> 40:09.775
I owe her that.

40:12.306 --> 40:13.715
Does she make you happy?

40:17.861 --> 40:18.951
Yeah, she does.

40:21.261 --> 40:22.366
Is it enough?

40:23.089 --> 40:24.280
It's enough for now.

40:28.440 --> 40:29.564
Okay.

40:29.862 --> 40:30.988
Okay.

40:35.466 --> 40:36.534
Dad.

40:38.480 --> 40:40.126
Don't grow up too much, okay?

40:41.544 --> 40:42.649
Hey.

40:45.360 --> 40:46.601
It's me we're talking about.

41:15.994 --> 41:18.368
You're probably surprised
to see me back here.

41:21.410 --> 41:23.122
I bet most cops never come back

41:23.123 --> 41:24.908
after they pass their psych eval.

41:25.612 --> 41:26.648
Everyone's different.

41:26.649 --> 41:27.700
Yeah.

41:27.903 --> 41:29.052
What's on your mind?

41:32.240 --> 41:34.232
I don't even know where to start.

41:35.972 --> 41:37.783
Well, why don't we start
with the shooting?

41:38.168 --> 41:39.941
Is any of it coming back to you?

41:42.681 --> 41:43.903
I lied....

41:46.106 --> 41:47.324
before.

41:48.316 --> 41:49.737
What do you remember?

41:52.950 --> 41:54.651
I remember everything.
