This week,

{\an8}Aspects of color,

two rounds of six.

04:25.348 --> 04:27.517

<i>six artists will tattoo</i>
<i>a skull with a top hat.</i>

04:36.401 --> 04:39.320
People have to tattoo
the exact same design.

04:39.404 --> 04:43.408
And that way, as judges,
we can compare apples to apples.

04:43.491 --> 04:46.369

<i>just as much as</i>
<i>we're testing how well</i>

<i>pretty fast</i>

<i>is to color</i>
<i>the [bleep] out of it.</i>

05:51.976 --> 05:52.977
{\an8}How the [bleep]
can you [bleep] up color

05:53.061 --> 05:54.187

06:41.400 --> 06:43.861

<i>-The whole tattoo is light.</i>

07:48.509 --> 07:50.219
[Oliver] <i> As far as</i>
<i>the color saturation goes,</i>

07:50.303 --> 07:51.220

<i>as it could be.</i>

07:55.725 --> 07:56.767
{\an5}-Clint.

07:55.725 --> 07:56.767
-<i> The water does kind of look</i>

07:56.851 --> 07:59.770

07:56.851 --> 07:59.770
-The water is dark.

07:59.854 --> 08:01.314
[Clint] I think it kind of helps
the yellow and orange.

[Oliver] <i> I like what you did</i>
<i>with the water.</i>

<i>I feel like the blue</i>
<i>could have been blended</i>

08:10.656 --> 08:11.490
<i>a little smoother.</i>

08:11.574 --> 08:13.284
It turned into
a rush job at the end.

08:13.367 --> 08:14.535
[Oliver] <i> At least</i>
<i>you didn't overpower that,</i>

08:14.619 --> 08:15.620
<i>putting too much dark</i>
<i>underneath it.</i>

08:17.580 --> 08:20.291

more correct than mine.

08:21.500 --> 08:22.710
{\an8}Oh!

08:22.793 --> 08:25.588
<i>So now it's about how well</i>
<i>you color [bleep] waves.</i>

08:25.671 --> 08:28.341
I thought it was about how well
you just color in general.

08:28.424 --> 08:30.051
{\an5}-[Dave] Tray.

08:28.424 --> 08:30.051
<i>-You took a different approach</i>

08:30.134 --> 08:31.427
<i>at coloring the flower.</i>

08:31.510 --> 08:32.929
<i>You know how to put</i>
<i>black shading into a tattoo</i>

08:33.011 --> 08:34.388
<i>to make the color pop,</i>
<i>and that comes through in this.</i>

08:34.472 --> 08:37.225
Definitely a much better
tattoo out of you.

08:37.308 --> 08:38.851
{\an5}-Thank you.

08:37.308 --> 08:38.851
<i>-All of a sudden,</i>

08:38.934 --> 08:40.645
{\an8}you do a good tattoo,
and you're awesome.

08:40.727 --> 08:42.270
{\an8}I mean, you should have been
doing good tattoos

08:42.355 --> 08:43.481
<i>right off the rip.</i>

08:43.563 --> 08:44.774
That's [bleep] ludicrous.

08:44.857 --> 08:46.108
Nick.

08:46.192 --> 08:46.692
{\an8}[Matt] <i> Although I've never seen</i>
<i>a green skull,</i>

08:46.776 --> 08:48.152
{\an8}<i>you made it work.</i>

08:48.236 --> 08:49.278
{\an8}<i>The one critique I have</i>
<i>is I just--</i>

08:49.362 --> 08:50.529
I don't like the dice.

08:50.613 --> 08:51.864
{\an8}<i>Kind of like</i>
<i>a geometric, boxy look.</i>

08:51.948 --> 08:55.785
{\an8}[Oliver] <i> You tried to get fancy</i>
<i>and make those dice see-through,</i>

08:55.868 --> 08:57.370
{\an8}which throws it off.

08:57.453 --> 08:58.621
{\an8}-Sebastian.

08:57.453 --> 08:58.621
{\an8}-[Oliver] <i> If you're gonna go</i>

08:58.704 --> 09:00.206
{\an8}<i>with that strong</i>
<i>of a yellow highlight</i>

09:00.289 --> 09:01.415
{\an8}<i>on the top of the hat,</i>
<i>should have had</i>

09:01.499 --> 09:03.793
{\an8}<i>a lot stronger highlight</i>
<i>on those dice.</i>

09:03.876 --> 09:04.502
We want to be able to see

09:04.585 --> 09:06.629
more color
than more black.

09:06.712 --> 09:08.464
{\an9}-Mark.

09:06.712 --> 09:08.464
{\an8}<i>-I know it's a Color Challenge,</i>

09:08.548 --> 09:09.966
{\an8}<i>but I don't think you needed</i>
<i>to go wall-to-wall.</i>

09:10.049 --> 09:12.969
{\an8}<i>You actually packed so much</i>
<i>purple into one little area.</i>

09:13.052 --> 09:14.887
A little skin break on it
would have made it pop,

09:14.971 --> 09:16.389
<i>so that the hat</i>
<i>didn't look so done</i>

09:16.472 --> 09:17.974
<i>and the skull look</i>
<i>so undone.</i>

09:18.975 --> 09:20.309
{\an3}Lalo.

09:20.393 --> 09:22.979
{\an8}I'm not too high on
just so many different colors.

09:23.062 --> 09:24.355
{\an8}[Oliver] <i> The background green</i>
<i>leaves a hard edge</i>

09:24.438 --> 09:26.440
instead of letting it
be soft.

09:26.524 --> 09:27.817
I always look
for my backgrounds

09:27.900 --> 09:29.485
to have a geometric shape
so it's solid.

09:29.568 --> 09:31.779
{\an8}<i>[Oliver] But it makes too harsh</i>
<i>of a square shape around it.</i>

09:34.156 --> 09:34.949
[Dave] Sarah.

09:35.032 --> 09:36.367
The color that's
in there is solid.

09:36.450 --> 09:37.743
{\an8}<i>The dice are really smooth.</i>

09:37.827 --> 09:39.954
{\an8}<i>The transition's Nice.</i>
<i>The banner's really clean.</i>

09:40.037 --> 09:41.330
{\an8}<i>I love the black in the hat.</i>

09:41.414 --> 09:43.541
{\an8}<i>I love that you didn't do</i>
<i>a bunch of color in there.</i>

09:43.624 --> 09:45.876
{\an5}-[Dave] Jesse.

09:43.624 --> 09:45.876
-The only complaint I have

09:45.960 --> 09:47.503
{\an8}<i>is that you use the same color</i>
<i>in the face</i>

09:47.586 --> 09:48.796
{\an8}<i>as you did in the banner.</i>

09:48.879 --> 09:50.298
{\an8}<i>You missed the Mark</i>
<i>because they're so similar</i>

09:50.381 --> 09:51.799
in such a small area.

09:54.093 --> 09:55.553
Round one, I have to say,
Tray speaks to me.

09:55.636 --> 09:58.306
<i>That black really set</i>
<i>the flower off.</i>

09:58.389 --> 09:59.849
{\an5}-No one else did it.

09:58.389 --> 09:59.849
-[Dave] Steve.

09:59.932 --> 10:03.144
[Chris] <i> He did the nicest</i>
<i>all-around job packing color.</i>

10:03.227 --> 10:04.186
Round two,
I have to say

10:04.270 --> 10:05.604
<i>that I liked</i>
<i>Sarah's limited color palette.</i>

10:05.688 --> 10:08.399
[Oliver] <i> Packed in,</i>
<i>blended well.</i>

10:08.482 --> 10:10.192
Now let's talk about Jesse.

10:10.276 --> 10:11.569
<i>Color choices I did not like.</i>

10:11.652 --> 10:13.654
[Oliver] <i> He doesn't really</i>
<i>operate</i> <i>under the gun.</i>

10:13.738 --> 10:17.575
{\an3}The whole idea behind flash
is you walk in and get it

10:17.658 --> 10:18.576
right then and there.

10:18.659 --> 10:19.452
I think we have
the battle royale.

10:19.535 --> 10:21.620
{\an5}-Let's do it.

10:19.535 --> 10:21.620
-Let's do it.

10:21.704 --> 10:23.748
Rounds one and two
are complete.

10:23.831 --> 10:27.293
The judges have decided that
the winner of the first round

10:27.376 --> 10:28.294
is Tray.

10:28.919 --> 10:30.171
[applause]

10:30.254 --> 10:32.298
[cheers and applause]

10:32.381 --> 10:34.258
The judges have decided

10:34.342 --> 10:36.302
that the winner
of round two...

10:38.512 --> 10:40.056
...is Sarah.

10:40.139 --> 10:44.268
[cheers and applause]

10:44.352 --> 10:47.021
[Dave] Tray and Sarah,
the two of you will face off

10:47.104 --> 10:48.064
in the final round.

10:48.147 --> 10:49.732
You will be tattooing
a gypsy girl.

10:51.734 --> 10:55.488
{\an8}This gypsy head
is a very commonly done tattoo,

10:55.571 --> 10:57.698
<i>and because these guys</i>
<i>had such hiccups</i>

10:57.782 --> 10:58.866
<i>doing an American</i>
<i>traditional eagle and flag,</i>

10:58.949 --> 11:01.452
we figured we'd throw 'em
a little more traditional.

11:01.535 --> 11:02.370
You're going down.

11:02.453 --> 11:03.454
{\an5}-That will be fun.

11:02.453 --> 11:03.454
-I'm winning this.

11:03.537 --> 11:04.497
<i>You better be able</i>

11:04.580 --> 11:05.873
<i>to back that [bleep] up.</i>

11:05.956 --> 11:06.916
{\an8}You're writing
a pretty large check there.

11:06.999 --> 11:08.250
{\an8}You don't want
that mother[bleep] to bounce.

11:08.334 --> 11:10.461
We are upping the pressure.

11:10.544 --> 11:12.338
You will now
only have 60 minutes

11:12.421 --> 11:13.756
to complete your tattoo.

11:13.839 --> 11:14.340
Let's get ready
to face off.

11:14.423 --> 11:16.926
[whispering] Finally!

11:17.009 --> 11:19.261
You have 60 minutes
to do your tattoos.

11:19.345 --> 11:22.223
And your time begins...

11:23.516 --> 11:24.683
...now.

11:24.767 --> 11:26.769
{\an8}This is a real competition.

11:26.852 --> 11:27.770
<i>Best against the best.</i>

11:27.853 --> 11:28.813
<i>Once I pick up</i>
<i>that tattoo machine,</i>

11:28.896 --> 11:31.482
<i>the competition's</i>
<i>getting shut down.</i>

11:31.565 --> 11:32.942
Oliver's gonna
love that [bleep].

11:33.025 --> 11:34.402
{\an8}This is
a traditional gypsy head,

11:34.485 --> 11:36.153
{\an8}something I'm really good at.

11:36.237 --> 11:37.279
<i>I've been doing this</i>
<i>20 years.</i>

11:37.363 --> 11:39.949
She wasn't even around
when this stuff came out.

11:40.032 --> 11:41.659
Thirty minutes remain.

11:43.869 --> 11:46.622
Is that the only flesh tone
you're gonna use?

11:46.705 --> 11:47.957
I don't know.
Depends on the time.

11:48.666 --> 11:49.959
You've got 25.

11:50.042 --> 11:51.544
So I think
you got the time.

11:51.627 --> 11:52.586
Alright.

11:52.670 --> 11:54.839
{\an8}Why the [bleep]
are Jesse and Mark helping Tray

11:54.922 --> 11:55.339
and no one's helping me?

11:55.423 --> 11:58.134
What the [bleep]?

11:58.217 --> 11:59.176
What do you think, Mark?

11:59.260 --> 12:00.219
Might be more of an issue

12:00.302 --> 12:01.846
of who's gonna finish.

12:01.929 --> 12:03.431
That's very comforting.

12:03.514 --> 12:04.306
{\an8}You're on top
of the world one minute,

12:04.390 --> 12:06.183
{\an8}putting your finger
in a guy's face.

12:06.267 --> 12:08.978
<i>Looks like the karmic scales</i>
<i>are biting Sarah in her ass.</i>

12:09.061 --> 12:10.771
[Dave] Fifteen minutes left.

12:13.524 --> 12:14.859
Get it, Sarah.
Come on.

12:14.942 --> 12:16.318
I'm working on it.

12:16.402 --> 12:19.947
{\an8}I feel completely out
of my element, off my game.

12:20.030 --> 12:22.158
<i>What the [bleep]?</i>
<i>Come on. Get it together.</i>

12:22.241 --> 12:23.784
This is really frustrating.

12:23.868 --> 12:25.202
Two minutes.

12:25.286 --> 12:27.496
That's a wrap.
Look at this guy.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.039
{\an5}-Whoa.

12:27.580 --> 12:29.039
-[laughter]

12:29.123 --> 12:31.542
Ten, nine, eight,

12:31.625 --> 12:34.295
seven, six, five,

12:34.378 --> 12:36.213
four, three,

12:36.297 --> 12:37.339
two, one.

12:37.423 --> 12:40.259
That's it.
Time's up.

12:40.342 --> 12:41.969
No more ink.

12:42.052 --> 12:43.220
<i>I don't even know</i>
<i>what to think right now.</i>

12:43.304 --> 12:45.764
{\an8}I did the best that I could
in the time that I was given.

12:45.848 --> 12:49.643
<i>I'm really hating myself</i>
<i>right now.</i>

12:52.396 --> 12:53.772
{\an8}Let's meet your canvases.

12:53.856 --> 12:55.441
{\an8}I'm getting a phoenix
shooting fire

12:55.524 --> 12:56.984
out of my vagina.

12:57.067 --> 12:58.444
Are you [bleep] crazy?

12:58.527 --> 13:00.654
You added that [bleep]
without telling me.

13:00.738 --> 13:08.662
That [bleep]
is not my style.

13:08.746 --> 13:11.999
{\an5}-Sarah.

13:08.746 --> 13:11.999
-The color is all pretty light.

13:12.082 --> 13:14.293
{\an5}<i>-It's not enough contrast.</i>

13:12.082 --> 13:14.293
-I ran out of time.

13:14.376 --> 13:15.961
[Chris] <i> Look at his color,</i>
<i>and look at the face.</i>

13:16.045 --> 13:18.547
Guy's one sun tan away
from not having any shading

13:18.631 --> 13:19.548
in the face.

13:19.632 --> 13:22.051
{\an5}-Tray.

13:19.632 --> 13:22.051
-I'm not a huge fan

13:22.134 --> 13:23.135
of the pink.

13:23.219 --> 13:24.470
{\an1}<i>It felt traditional,</i>
<i>so I went traditional.</i>

13:24.553 --> 13:25.429
<i>With the black stars,</i>

13:25.513 --> 13:26.555
I think it made it
look a little better.

13:26.639 --> 13:27.723
[Oliver] <i> This color stands out.</i>

13:27.806 --> 13:29.808
<i>When it heals,</i>
<i>it's gonna look real nice.</i>

13:32.895 --> 13:34.563
This is the final face-off.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.106
We're testing color.

13:36.190 --> 13:37.900
Almost every tattooer here
has fear of black,

13:37.983 --> 13:40.194
and that's why color doesn't
look as vibrant as it should.

13:40.277 --> 13:42.279
<i>Tray did it</i>
<i>as a traditional-style tattoo.</i>

13:42.363 --> 13:43.614
{\an5}-He did the black.

13:42.363 --> 13:43.614
-[Dave] <i> As a client,</i>

13:43.697 --> 13:45.115
<i>if I was in seeing Tray</i>

13:45.199 --> 13:47.785
and then he packed in all that
pink last minute, I'd be bummed.

13:47.868 --> 13:49.411
I would too
if I had to wear it.

13:49.495 --> 13:50.246
{\an5}-I like it.

13:49.495 --> 13:50.246
-He tried to--

13:50.329 --> 13:51.747
he tried to do something
for Ollie.

13:51.830 --> 13:53.749
{\an5}<i>-Sarah.</i>

13:51.830 --> 13:53.749
<i>-Sarah needed more time.</i>

13:53.832 --> 13:55.292
<i>She would have put</i>
<i>on the canvas</i>

13:55.376 --> 13:56.502
what she was thinking
in her head.

13:56.585 --> 13:57.753
[Oliver] <i> It looks clean,</i>
<i>it looks sharp,</i>

13:57.836 --> 14:01.257
<i>but this is a stereotypical</i>
<i>tattoo that's gonna need</i>

14:01.340 --> 14:03.717
{\an5}-to be redone in five years.

14:01.340 --> 14:03.717
-Sounds like we have a choice.

14:03.801 --> 14:04.927
{\an5}-Want to go let 'em know?

14:03.801 --> 14:04.927
-Yeah.

14:05.010 --> 14:06.178
Let's do it.

14:06.262 --> 14:08.138
In this Flash Challenge,
we tested you

14:08.222 --> 14:09.390
on color.

14:09.473 --> 14:11.517
Sarah and Tray,
it's down to the two of you.

14:11.600 --> 14:13.352
The judges have come
to a decision.

14:15.521 --> 14:16.939
And the winner is Tray.

14:18.899 --> 14:20.067
[cheers and applause]

14:22.194 --> 14:22.945
<i>Not only did I beat Sarah,</i>

14:23.028 --> 14:24.738
I beat her at something
she thinks

14:24.822 --> 14:26.282
<i>she's the best at,</i>

14:26.365 --> 14:27.533
{\an8}and that feels unbelievable.

14:27.616 --> 14:30.286
[Dave] Not only will you get
to select your own human canvas,

14:30.369 --> 14:31.370
but you'll also have
the power to assign

14:31.453 --> 14:33.497
all the human canvases.

14:33.581 --> 14:35.457
Head back to the loft,
get ready to meet

14:35.541 --> 14:38.419
your canvases
for the next elimination tattoo.

14:39.670 --> 14:40.671
<i>I'm devastated.</i>

14:40.754 --> 14:43.340
{\an8}I'm just so frustrated
with myself.

14:43.424 --> 14:45.759
[sobs]

14:45.843 --> 14:48.095
I feel like
I let myself down on this.

14:53.934 --> 14:55.394
I know this small word
that begins with a "P"

14:55.477 --> 14:57.646
called pressure.

14:57.730 --> 14:58.689
That little word, man,
holds a lot of weight.

14:58.772 --> 15:00.983
Not really.
If you're good

15:01.066 --> 15:03.485
and know you're good
and do what you do, that's it.

15:03.569 --> 15:04.570
Sarah, you don't do well
under pressure, babe.

15:04.653 --> 15:05.487
I'm gonna go ahead
and tell you that honestly.

15:05.571 --> 15:07.698
You get frustrated.

15:07.781 --> 15:08.866
You throw tantrums.

15:08.949 --> 15:10.909
And I still got farther
than you.

15:10.993 --> 15:11.785
No, I'm sitting right here
with you actually, but...

15:11.869 --> 15:12.786
I still got farther
than you.

15:12.870 --> 15:15.039
How many Flash Challenges
you get?

15:15.122 --> 15:16.206
I'm talking about the one
where you say--

15:16.290 --> 15:18.542
How many Flash Challenges
do you have?

15:18.626 --> 15:20.085
{\an5}-Is this hair cutting master <i> ?</i>

15:18.626 --> 15:20.085
-No, it's not.

15:20.169 --> 15:21.670
But did you win
the Flash Challenge

15:21.754 --> 15:22.713
in which you tattooed?

15:22.796 --> 15:24.465
{\an5}-I didn't.

15:22.796 --> 15:24.465
{\an3}-Oh.

15:24.548 --> 15:25.716
A challenge is a challenge.

15:25.799 --> 15:26.800
And the original question
was, you said...

15:26.884 --> 15:27.676
{\an5}-Numbers don't lie.

15:26.884 --> 15:27.676
-That I don't deal well

15:27.760 --> 15:29.678
{\an5}-under pressure.

15:27.760 --> 15:29.678
{\an3}-You don't.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.430
{\an5}-I do.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.430
-Tray!

15:31.513 --> 15:32.806
Come on over here, buddy.

15:32.890 --> 15:34.767
Let's paint the picture here.

15:34.850 --> 15:37.728
"You're going down!
I got this!"

15:37.811 --> 15:39.813
I was having [bleep] fun.

15:39.897 --> 15:41.857
You didn't have fun
after you lost, though.

15:42.733 --> 15:45.235
You're a [bleep] dick.

15:45.319 --> 15:46.820
{\an5}-Pressure.

15:45.319 --> 15:46.820
-Pressure.

15:46.904 --> 15:48.906
See what I mean?
People like that lose

15:48.989 --> 15:50.366
'cause they don't know
how to win.

15:50.449 --> 15:50.949
[door shuts]

16:02.127 --> 16:04.296
Welcome to this week's
elimination tattoo.

16:04.380 --> 16:06.131
Nail it
and you'll be that much closer

16:06.215 --> 16:08.967
to 100 grand,
a feature in <i> Inked</i> <i>Magazine,</i>

16:09.051 --> 16:10.094
and the title of <i> Ink Master.</i>

16:10.177 --> 16:11.220
As you know,

16:11.303 --> 16:13.472
each week you'll also be judged
by America.

16:13.555 --> 16:15.641
Viewers at home
will vote for the tattoo

16:15.724 --> 16:18.060
they think is best
using the same criteria

16:18.143 --> 16:19.561
that the judges use.

16:19.645 --> 16:21.438
This week, we're testing you
on color.

16:21.522 --> 16:23.732
{\an8}The judges are looking
for how saturated your color is,

16:23.816 --> 16:26.068
{\an8}how rich,
how vibrant,

16:26.151 --> 16:26.902
<i>how hard it pops.</i>

16:26.985 --> 16:29.405
[Dave]
For this elimination tattoo,

16:29.488 --> 16:30.698
we're going new school.

16:30.781 --> 16:32.491
{\an5}-Oh.

16:30.781 --> 16:32.491
-Wow.

16:32.574 --> 16:33.742
{\an5}-[bleep].

16:32.574 --> 16:33.742
-Awesome.

16:33.826 --> 16:37.663
{\an8}New school's
more a cartoony, pop vibe.

16:37.746 --> 16:40.916
You can exaggerate stuff.
You can go as crazy as you want.

16:40.999 --> 16:43.585
[Dave] New school tattoos
are bold, bright,

16:43.669 --> 16:45.838
and include
fantastical designs.

16:45.921 --> 16:48.090
{\an8}Jesse is amazing
at this [bleep].

16:48.173 --> 16:51.635
<i>He's the baddest new schooler</i>
<i>in the house.</i>

16:51.719 --> 16:52.594
Five million people
are gonna watch me

16:52.678 --> 16:55.180
kick your [bleep] ass at this.

16:55.264 --> 16:56.432
Hey, man,
I hope so.

16:56.515 --> 16:59.101
{\an8}I'm getting a underhand pitch
in a baseball game.

16:59.184 --> 17:01.395
{\an8}I mean, I got to hit this
out of the park.

17:02.438 --> 17:03.939
Let's meet your canvases.

17:09.778 --> 17:10.904
Tray, because you won
the Flash Challenge,

17:10.988 --> 17:13.490
you now have the power
to assign

17:13.574 --> 17:14.992
all the human canvases.

17:15.075 --> 17:16.993
Your fate
is in your hands.

17:17.077 --> 17:19.038
<i>I'm gonna do</i>
<i>something a little different.</i>

17:19.121 --> 17:20.122
<i>Rather than give them</i>
<i>something they're not good at,</i>

17:20.204 --> 17:23.208
{\an8}I want to give them
something they are good at.

17:23.291 --> 17:24.460
What were you wanting to get?

17:24.542 --> 17:26.670
A bird transitioning
to a skeleton on my neck.

17:26.753 --> 17:28.130
<i>That way,</i>
<i>when I beat 'em,</i>

17:28.213 --> 17:28.922
the victory's gonna be
even greater.

17:29.006 --> 17:31.049
What is it
you're wanting to get?

17:31.133 --> 17:33.051
I'm getting a phoenix
shooting fire out of my vagina.

17:36.388 --> 17:37.306
Out of her vagina.

17:37.389 --> 17:39.016
<i>Where do you get</i>
<i>these people?</i>

17:39.683 --> 17:40.851
{\an8}I do not want

17:40.934 --> 17:43.395
<i>the fire-breathing vagina</i>
<i>tattoo.</i>

17:43.479 --> 17:44.646
It's a terrifying idea.

17:44.730 --> 17:46.523
Fire shooting out
of a vagina.

17:46.607 --> 17:49.485
{\an8}Vagina tattoo
is very broad.

17:49.568 --> 17:50.986
Define "shooting out."

17:51.069 --> 17:51.737
<i>I don't know</i>
<i>what the big fuss is about,</i>

17:51.820 --> 17:54.531
{\an8}unless you're scared
of vaginas.

17:54.615 --> 17:55.491
Sun and moon
on my back.

17:55.574 --> 17:57.826
Brain popping out of the back
of my head.

17:57.910 --> 17:59.453
Head tattoo.

17:59.536 --> 18:01.121
He'll never [bleep] survive
that.

18:01.205 --> 18:03.540
{\an8}It's his [bleep] head.

18:03.624 --> 18:05.501
Why would somebody even come
to you for that?

18:05.584 --> 18:06.001
I mean, the head hurts.

18:06.085 --> 18:07.252
<i>I would know.</i>

18:10.464 --> 18:12.090
Booyah.
There you all go.

18:12.174 --> 18:14.343
Canvases, one by one,
please reveal

18:14.426 --> 18:15.677
the name on the bottom
of your skull.

18:15.761 --> 18:17.429
Big daddy Tray.

18:17.513 --> 18:19.556
Sarah.

18:22.100 --> 18:22.226
Jamie.

18:24.269 --> 18:25.604
[whooping]

18:25.687 --> 18:28.065
{\an8}oh, I definitely got handed
a [bleep] sandwich on this one.

18:28.148 --> 18:28.398
Oh, [bleep].

18:28.482 --> 18:30.442
Steve.

18:30.526 --> 18:31.693
Kay Kutta.

18:31.777 --> 18:32.778
Lalo.

18:32.861 --> 18:34.279
{\an5}-Jesse.

18:32.861 --> 18:34.279
-Nick.

18:35.197 --> 18:36.281
Tatu Baby.

18:36.365 --> 18:38.367
{\an5}-Mark.

18:36.365 --> 18:38.367
-Sebastian.

18:38.450 --> 18:40.953
{\an5}-Clint.

18:38.450 --> 18:40.953
-Out of all the tattoos

18:41.036 --> 18:43.163
{\an8}for me to do up there,
he gave me the [bleep] head.

18:43.247 --> 18:45.207
{\an8}Why couldn't Jesse
get the [bleep] head?

18:45.290 --> 18:46.583
Alright, you guys have
the rest of the evening

18:46.667 --> 18:48.418
to consult
with your human canvas.

18:48.502 --> 18:50.546
Tomorrow,
you'll have six hours

18:50.629 --> 18:52.881
to complete
your new school tattoo.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.884
Based on your work,
one of you will be closing shop.

18:55.968 --> 18:59.721
{\an5}-Good luck.

18:55.968 --> 18:59.721
-Here we go.

18:59.805 --> 19:01.557
{\an8}New school
is always whatever

19:01.640 --> 19:03.392
{\an8}is the latest, hippest,
poppiest thing.

19:03.475 --> 19:06.019
<i>Bright color.</i>
<i>Crazy, outrageous designs.</i>

19:06.103 --> 19:09.106
It's probably the best thing
to judge a color challenge on

19:09.189 --> 19:10.607
'cause there's no limitations.

19:10.691 --> 19:12.192
You mind me
just color-bombing it?

19:12.276 --> 19:14.903
{\an5}-Like purples, reds--

19:12.276 --> 19:14.903
-Bomb the hell out of it.

19:14.987 --> 19:17.990
The phoenix will be--
the body will be here,

19:18.073 --> 19:20.826
and then head pretty much
facing, like, and angled

19:20.909 --> 19:22.953
toward you,
but, like, to a side profile.

19:23.036 --> 19:24.621
<i>Anything else</i>
<i>you'd like to give me?</i>

19:24.705 --> 19:25.956
<i>Am I gonna be tattooing</i>

19:26.039 --> 19:27.875
{\an8}inside of someone's
[bleep] mouth next time?

19:27.958 --> 19:29.126
Do you want pants off?

19:29.209 --> 19:32.462
Do I get to do
a fire-breathing ass[bleep]?

19:32.546 --> 19:35.924
I don't know how we're
gonna be doing blowing fire.

19:36.008 --> 19:37.759
{\an8}My canvas wants
a sun and a moon tattoo

19:37.843 --> 19:38.719
{\an8}on her upper back.

19:38.802 --> 19:41.346
You know,
we might not even need this.

19:41.430 --> 19:43.182
{\an5}-All around?

19:41.430 --> 19:43.182
-I mean, no, we do.

19:43.265 --> 19:45.767
What I'm trying
to figure out now is the design.

19:45.851 --> 19:47.895
It's almost impossible

19:47.978 --> 19:50.439
because she's constantly
contradicting herself.

19:50.522 --> 19:52.024
I don't want the face.

19:52.107 --> 19:54.318
{\an5}-So I could use like--

19:52.107 --> 19:54.318
-I mean, you could do the face.

19:54.401 --> 19:55.944
It's up to you.

19:56.028 --> 19:57.029
{\an5}-I mean, honestly--

19:56.028 --> 19:57.029
-Don't say it's up to me,

19:57.112 --> 19:58.614
'cause then you just change
your mind instantly.

19:58.697 --> 20:00.240
Don't say-because you said
it's up to me

20:00.324 --> 20:01.450
{\an5}-about eight times.

20:00.324 --> 20:01.450
-I want it to look good.

20:01.533 --> 20:02.618
I know,
but you're very picky.

20:02.701 --> 20:04.453
So should I trust you?
Should I not trust you?

20:04.536 --> 20:05.579
But you're not trusting me.

20:05.662 --> 20:07.122
Every time you say
it's up to me,

20:07.205 --> 20:08.624
you're like, "Oh, it's not,"
so I'm drawing things--

20:08.707 --> 20:10.626
'Cause you're not sure
of yourself.

20:10.709 --> 20:11.793
<i>I don't even know</i>
<i>what to do.</i>

20:11.877 --> 20:13.211
I just don't know
how to handle this.

20:13.295 --> 20:15.923
Actually,
I do have another idea.

20:16.006 --> 20:17.174
What do you want?

20:17.257 --> 20:17.799
It's basically a heart.

20:17.883 --> 20:20.302
It's your call right now,

20:20.385 --> 20:23.013
but, like, definitely need
to settle on something.

20:24.681 --> 20:25.724
I want it to start,
like, right here

20:25.807 --> 20:28.936
and go down to the back
and over here on the side.

20:29.019 --> 20:30.896
Okay, that's not gonna happen
in six hours.

20:30.979 --> 20:32.814
<i>What happened</i>
<i>in your life?</i>

20:32.898 --> 20:33.815
{\an8}If you want the back
of your head to look

20:33.899 --> 20:35.025
{\an8}like it's blown
the [bleep] out,

20:35.108 --> 20:36.401
<i>you got your brains</i>
<i>hanging out,</i>

20:36.485 --> 20:37.903
who thinks of this stuff?

20:37.986 --> 20:39.237
Are you dead set--
dead set on this?

20:39.321 --> 20:41.740
Yes. Been wanting it
for 15 years.

20:41.823 --> 20:43.659
So that means,
if you pass out, you don't mind?

20:43.742 --> 20:45.160
I'm not gonna pass out.

20:45.243 --> 20:46.495
You really--

20:46.578 --> 20:47.955
{\an5}-You sure about that?

20:46.578 --> 20:47.955
-Yeah.

20:48.038 --> 20:49.831
{\an3}This tattoo could very well
send me the [bleep] home.

20:49.915 --> 20:51.416
♪ I'm so [bleep] dead ♪

20:51.500 --> 20:52.751
♪ I'm so [bleep] dead ♪

21:00.509 --> 21:03.095
{\an8}Last night, I cried.

21:03.178 --> 21:04.846
{\an8}I moped around a little bit,

21:04.930 --> 21:05.931
{\an8}I went to sleep,
I woke up the next day

21:06.014 --> 21:07.015
{\an8}ready to fight again.

21:07.099 --> 21:09.726
<i>I can rise to the challenge</i>

21:09.810 --> 21:11.353
<i>in a way</i>
<i>that Kay can't.</i>

21:11.436 --> 21:12.813
<i>I have a fighting spirit.</i>

21:12.896 --> 21:15.774
You [bleep] on me,
and I come back strong.

21:18.151 --> 21:19.444
For today's
elimination tattoo,

21:19.528 --> 21:21.530
you have six hours
to prove your color skills

21:21.613 --> 21:22.906
with a new school design.

21:22.990 --> 21:26.702
And your time begins now.

21:26.785 --> 21:29.788
Good luck, Jesse.

21:30.831 --> 21:32.165
Let's see what we got here.

21:32.249 --> 21:35.335
{\an8}New school's basically loud,
color bomb, cartoony tattooing.

21:35.419 --> 21:37.421
<i>We're looking for the artist</i>

21:37.504 --> 21:40.048
<i>to use smooth blends,</i>
<i>contrasting color,</i>

21:40.132 --> 21:42.050
and color palette
to make the design pop.

21:42.134 --> 21:43.885
It's not nerve-racking
or anything.

21:43.969 --> 21:45.554
Let's do this [bleep].

21:45.637 --> 21:47.347
You said you didn't
really want it cartoony,

21:47.431 --> 21:50.559
{\an5}-so I colored it darker.

21:47.431 --> 21:50.559
-Yeah. Oh, wow.

21:50.642 --> 21:51.852
{\an5}-That's on the ball.

21:50.642 --> 21:51.852
{\an1}-Cool.

21:51.935 --> 21:53.937
I'm very proud of you.

21:54.021 --> 21:55.147
Thanks.
Give me a hug.

21:55.230 --> 21:56.565
{\an5}-It was hard.

21:55.230 --> 21:56.565
-Yay!

21:56.648 --> 21:57.774
Cool.

21:57.858 --> 21:59.735
{\an8}My canvas has,
like, five personalities.

21:59.818 --> 22:02.738
She goes from being psycho crazy
to giving me hugs.

22:02.821 --> 22:04.406
Just crazy.
Check it out.

22:04.489 --> 22:05.282
Very centered.

22:05.365 --> 22:06.742
I mean,
it's not a symmetrical design.

22:06.825 --> 22:08.535
[Litsa] <i> Getting tattooed</i>
<i>by Nick</i>

22:08.618 --> 22:10.245
<i>is gonna be</i>
<i>a total challenge.</i>

22:10.328 --> 22:11.747
{\an8}And I'm a little nervous.

22:11.830 --> 22:13.749
<i>He better do it right.</i>

22:13.832 --> 22:15.459
That's a little high.

22:15.542 --> 22:16.710
{\an5}-You want to go lower?

22:15.542 --> 22:16.710
-Yeah.

22:16.793 --> 22:17.961
Alright.
She's got a couple

22:18.045 --> 22:19.588
<i>weird requests,</i>
<i>but she's being a good client.</i>

22:19.671 --> 22:22.257
[chuckles]

22:22.340 --> 22:22.758
I'm actually relieved.

22:22.841 --> 22:25.010
Hallelujah.

22:29.848 --> 22:31.641
What are you
grinning about, sir?

22:31.725 --> 22:33.727
{\an8}I've had some people
making unnecessary visits

22:33.810 --> 22:35.062
<i>to my office.</i>

22:35.145 --> 22:36.480
I'd rather hang in here
with the hottie.

22:36.563 --> 22:38.106
Tattoo artists
do not beat around the bush.

22:38.190 --> 22:40.233
What is the craziest part

22:40.317 --> 22:42.069
you've ever tattooed
on somebody?

22:43.862 --> 22:44.613
Oh, my god.

22:44.696 --> 22:46.782
It's not my first trip
down there.

22:46.865 --> 22:49.117
<i>Sometimes it actually</i>
<i>isn't that bad.</i>

22:49.201 --> 22:52.204
There's just no way to know
till you get down there.

22:59.711 --> 23:04.549
Ow!
[bleep]!

23:04.633 --> 23:07.177
We're almost done
with the Taurus.

23:07.260 --> 23:08.720
{\an8}My canvas is not handling
the pain so well.

23:08.804 --> 23:10.806
Ow.

23:10.889 --> 23:11.640
I'm starting to worry.

23:14.518 --> 23:14.976
You're doing great, boss.

23:15.060 --> 23:17.020
This guy is a beast.

23:17.104 --> 23:19.147
{\an8}He's doing exactly
what I want him to do,

23:19.231 --> 23:21.983
{\an8}which is just sitting there
and taking this punishment.

23:23.902 --> 23:25.987
I think it looks
just like him.

23:26.071 --> 23:27.364
I'm glad you like it.

23:27.447 --> 23:29.866
{\an8}Being that this is
a new school competition

23:29.950 --> 23:30.992
<i>and new school is</i>
<i>what I predominantly do,</i>

23:31.076 --> 23:33.078
I should be on the top.

23:33.161 --> 23:35.664
<i>Jesse Smith</i>
<i>is a player in this game.</i>

23:35.747 --> 23:38.166
He is the queen
on the chessboard.

23:38.250 --> 23:39.251
I'm a new school kid,
you know?

23:39.334 --> 23:40.335
I grew up doing new school,

23:40.418 --> 23:42.087
so I'm a lot more comfortable.

23:42.170 --> 23:44.089
I'm coming after that
mother[bleep].

23:44.881 --> 23:45.966
Two hours left.

23:52.097 --> 23:54.141
<i>My client is leaving</i>
<i>the color palette</i>

23:54.224 --> 23:55.851
{\an8}completely up to me.

23:55.934 --> 23:57.269
{\an8}I'm gonna shine on this.

23:57.352 --> 23:58.728
So what's that--
a cross between, like,

23:58.812 --> 24:01.648
{\an5}-a velociraptor and a lizard?

23:58.812 --> 24:01.648
-And a T-Rex.

24:01.731 --> 24:03.358
And whatever
the [bleep] else...

24:03.442 --> 24:06.194
{\an5}-Yeah.

24:03.442 --> 24:06.194
-I thought would look cool.

24:06.278 --> 24:08.363
I know colors.
I can rock this.

24:08.446 --> 24:10.740
<i>Now they're gonna see</i>
<i>what I'm capable of.</i>

24:13.785 --> 24:16.037
To tell you the truth,
it looks ugly.

24:16.121 --> 24:18.748
{\an5}-Okay.

24:16.121 --> 24:18.748
-You see those three spikes?

24:18.832 --> 24:19.708
That doesn't look right.

24:19.791 --> 24:21.376
You kept telling me to do
whatever I want.

24:21.459 --> 24:24.838
You went overboard
with those things.

24:24.921 --> 24:26.381
I don't like it at all.

24:26.464 --> 24:28.592
That's not in the drawing.
Why did you do that?

24:28.675 --> 24:29.009
You're freaking me out.

24:29.092 --> 24:30.719
Oh, my god.

24:30.802 --> 24:32.053
All right,
we have to fix this.

24:32.137 --> 24:34.556
For some reason,
the five little magenta spikes

24:34.639 --> 24:35.891
I add totally destroyed
the entire tattoo for her.

24:35.974 --> 24:37.893
This is insane.

24:37.976 --> 24:39.895
You added that [bleep]
without telling me.

24:39.978 --> 24:42.147
{\an5}-Why would you sit back down?

24:39.978 --> 24:42.147
-You said "More magenta?"

24:42.230 --> 24:43.732
I said, "Yes."

24:43.815 --> 24:45.901
You didn't say magenta spikes.

24:45.984 --> 24:48.111
That [bleep]
is not my style.

24:48.195 --> 24:50.197
{\an8}If someone's not happy
with permanent work

24:50.280 --> 24:52.449
{\an8}that's on their body,

24:52.532 --> 24:56.328
that's a really justified reason
to freak out.

24:56.411 --> 24:58.622
But there are spikes
on the vines.

24:58.705 --> 25:00.749
How is spikes
not your style?

25:00.832 --> 25:03.418
You're making me
even angrier.

25:03.501 --> 25:07.172
<i>I mean, who wants to get work</i>
<i>done by, like, a prick?</i>

25:07.255 --> 25:09.090
You don't [bleep] do that--

25:09.174 --> 25:10.008
and especially
it's on my back.

25:10.091 --> 25:12.177
I can't [bleep] see it.

25:12.260 --> 25:14.512
You're [bleep] taking advantage
of that [bleep].

25:15.972 --> 25:18.016
Dude, that chick
is [bleep] nuts in there, man.

25:18.099 --> 25:19.935
I need something other
than this.

25:20.018 --> 25:21.269
I really don't want
to change it.

25:21.353 --> 25:23.480
{\an5}-I like it.

25:21.353 --> 25:23.480
-Are you kidding me?

25:23.563 --> 25:26.233
That girl in there screaming
like that, man.

25:26.316 --> 25:28.276
Remember who designed
the whole tattoo.

25:28.360 --> 25:29.319
{\an5}-Oh, give me a break.

25:28.360 --> 25:29.319
-That's what I thought.

25:29.402 --> 25:32.530
{\an8}Nick is just
a really [bleep] nice guy.

25:32.614 --> 25:35.242
<i>There are some clients that you</i>
<i>cannot be that nice to.</i>

25:35.325 --> 25:37.494
You just said
you're not changing it.

25:37.577 --> 25:38.662
And that's what this is about.

25:38.745 --> 25:40.372
{\an5}-You're not changing it.

25:38.745 --> 25:40.372
-I will change it.

25:40.455 --> 25:41.831
{\an5}-'Cause you're not changing it.

25:40.455 --> 25:41.831
-I can't change it in that way.

25:41.915 --> 25:43.291
Because it's your work.
Is that what this Is?

25:43.375 --> 25:45.710
She's just [bleep] crazy.

25:45.794 --> 25:46.795
<i>I'm in the biggest tattoo</i>
<i>competition</i>

25:46.878 --> 25:49.464
<i>and she's just not giving me</i>
<i>any leeway,</i>

25:49.548 --> 25:51.549
<i>just digging my grave for me.</i>

25:55.387 --> 25:58.473
{\an5}-This is going to be so pretty.

25:55.387 --> 25:58.473
-Sexy lady.

25:58.556 --> 26:00.392
{\an5}-[giggles]

25:58.556 --> 26:00.392
<i>-New school has evolved a lot.</i>

26:00.475 --> 26:02.811
{\an8}It doesn't have to be, like,
bright and neon anymore.

26:02.894 --> 26:03.728
You got, like,
40 ink caps,

26:03.812 --> 26:06.982
seven, eight
different needles set up.

26:07.065 --> 26:10.235
{\an8}It's not a test to see
who can use 20 ink caps

26:10.318 --> 26:12.445
<i>and fill 'em all with color</i>
<i>and use every one of them.</i>

26:12.529 --> 26:14.030
Oliver, he has a big mouth.

26:14.114 --> 26:16.992
<i>I'm not just gonna start</i>
<i>throwing some neon colors</i>

26:17.075 --> 26:17.575
'cause it wouldn't even
look right.

26:20.036 --> 26:22.122
Thirty minutes remain, guys.

26:26.001 --> 26:27.419
Ow!

26:29.170 --> 26:30.630
You really just did that
without telling me.

26:30.714 --> 26:33.216
Like, just [bleep] admit that
[bleep] right now.

26:33.300 --> 26:34.301
You told me,
"Do whatever you want."

26:34.384 --> 26:38.096
You added
the [bleep] spiky crap.

26:38.179 --> 26:39.222
Where there's skin
in the spikes,

26:39.306 --> 26:40.682
I can do yellow
if you want it.

26:40.765 --> 26:42.517
Do the yellow!
Just do the yellow!

26:42.600 --> 26:44.686
Are you sure?
I'll do it.

26:44.769 --> 26:46.688
What I'm trying to do
is do exactly what she wants

26:46.771 --> 26:48.523
<i>so that I can survive</i>
<i>in the competition.</i>

26:48.606 --> 26:51.985
Why would you [bleep]
do this [bleep]?

26:52.068 --> 26:54.029
To piss me off.

26:54.112 --> 26:54.654
Two-minute warning,
everybody.

26:59.993 --> 27:01.077
{\an8}Just hurry.

27:01.161 --> 27:02.370
You're good, you're good.

27:02.454 --> 27:04.122
<i>She's basically doing</i>
<i>everything she can</i>

27:04.205 --> 27:05.832
to make this tattoo
rough on me.

27:05.915 --> 27:07.584
[gasps]
Don't worry.

27:07.667 --> 27:09.419
I'm only gonna be here
for a quick second.

27:09.502 --> 27:10.545
[groans]

27:10.628 --> 27:12.422
<i>My canvas is throwing me</i>
<i>off of my game.</i>

27:12.505 --> 27:13.548
[gasps]

27:13.631 --> 27:15.675
Ten, nine,

27:15.759 --> 27:18.219
eight, seven, six,

27:18.303 --> 27:21.097
five, four, three,

27:21.181 --> 27:22.223
two, one.

27:22.307 --> 27:24.392
Time's up.
That's it.

27:24.476 --> 27:27.062
Machines down.
No more ink.

27:27.771 --> 27:27.812
You're done?

27:30.815 --> 27:32.067
{\an5}-Tada.

27:30.815 --> 27:32.067
-These are awesome.

27:32.150 --> 27:34.527
You freaked me out.

27:34.611 --> 27:35.570
I just had a panic attack.

27:35.653 --> 27:37.906
<i>This is one</i>
<i>of the best tattoos</i>

27:37.989 --> 27:39.199
she even has on her body.

27:39.282 --> 27:40.700
<i>I just never want</i>
<i>to deal with a client</i>

27:40.784 --> 27:42.243
<i>like this ever again.</i>

27:42.327 --> 27:43.495
Ow, that hurts worse than
the damn tattoo.

27:43.578 --> 27:45.455
<i>I've got some rough blends</i>

27:45.538 --> 27:47.749
and I didn't get to bold
the lines

27:47.832 --> 27:48.958
the way that I wanted to.

27:49.042 --> 27:50.502
<i>I'ma get pimp-slapped</i>
<i>by the hand</i>

27:50.585 --> 27:52.003
of the tattoo gods today.

27:54.381 --> 27:57.842
{\an8}If you go out of your way
to cause discomfort,

27:57.926 --> 27:59.552
{\an8}then yes, you're [bleep]
up the tattoo!

27:59.636 --> 28:00.762
I'll straight choke you
the [bleep] up.

28:00.845 --> 28:03.932
This is the worst tattoo
I've seen you do.

28:04.015 --> 28:04.891
You're [bleep] this up.

28:11.022 --> 28:11.773
I don't know what the heck
I would've done

28:11.856 --> 28:13.650
if I had a client
like that, man.

28:13.733 --> 28:14.776
It was just crazy.

28:14.859 --> 28:15.860
This morning,
you were, like,

28:15.944 --> 28:16.778
"No, she's great, man.

28:16.861 --> 28:17.904
She's a totally different
person."

28:17.987 --> 28:19.114
She really was.

28:19.197 --> 28:20.073
Like, last night, she was
some crazy, psychotic animal.

28:20.156 --> 28:21.866
This morning,
she's just a whole new person.

28:21.950 --> 28:22.992
She's, like,
"Oh, I love that design.

28:23.076 --> 28:25.662
I can't wait for this."
And then I did the tattoo.

28:25.745 --> 28:26.538
And that last five minutes,

28:26.621 --> 28:27.747
she just went back
to crazy-ass.

28:27.831 --> 28:29.124
<i>Nick didn't know</i>
<i>how to handle</i>

28:29.207 --> 28:31.793
<i>this situation</i>
<i>'cause he's too inexperienced.</i>

28:31.876 --> 28:33.461
{\an8}Nick dropped the ball on
this one.

28:33.545 --> 28:34.921
I just did whatever
she wanted.

28:35.004 --> 28:36.297
She basically drew the tattoo

28:36.381 --> 28:37.173
and put it
where she wanted to.

28:37.257 --> 28:39.717
I'm, just, like-[sighs]
whatever.

28:39.801 --> 28:42.303
<i>Nick let her take the pencil</i>
<i>and design her own tattoo.</i>

28:42.387 --> 28:44.389
{\an8}Are you [bleep] crazy?

28:44.472 --> 28:46.683
Like, I don't ever
get worked up like this.

28:46.766 --> 28:46.808
Never.

29:07.787 --> 29:10.874
This week, you had six hours
to complete a new school tattoo.

29:10.957 --> 29:12.500
We're testing you on color.

29:13.668 --> 29:14.752
Steve, let's start with you.

29:16.796 --> 29:18.381
The new school challenge
came up,

29:18.465 --> 29:20.091
so everybody
got to draw really ugly

29:20.175 --> 29:21.426
<i>and do really--</i>
[groans]

29:21.509 --> 29:22.552
<i>Because it was new school,</i>

29:22.635 --> 29:24.095
so it's, like,
"Oh, that's okay."

29:24.179 --> 29:25.346
I want to see smooth stuff.

29:25.430 --> 29:26.681
<i>Some of the shading</i>
<i>in the top of her hair</i>

29:26.764 --> 29:28.641
<i>and some of the color--</i>
<i>it's just not the smoothest</i>

29:28.725 --> 29:29.726
<i>that I've seen you do.</i>

29:29.809 --> 29:31.311
'Cause it's not something
I do a lot of.

29:31.394 --> 29:32.187
If this isn't what you do,

29:32.270 --> 29:33.897
<i>then you gotta</i>
<i>go figure it out</i>

29:33.980 --> 29:36.274
<i>and make sure that that tattoo</i>
<i>is gonna look good.</i>

29:38.318 --> 29:39.486
Jamie.

29:40.278 --> 29:42.739
She wanted
a vagina phoenix.

29:42.822 --> 29:45.200
Thankfully, it wasn't exactly
how she made it sound.

29:45.283 --> 29:48.203
<i>This thing to me just looks</i>
<i>like a cartoony peacock</i>

29:48.286 --> 29:49.412
with a little bit of fire
around it.

29:49.496 --> 29:51.331
She kind of wanted to stay
minimal on the flames.

29:51.414 --> 29:53.124
{\an1}<i>You didn't really blend</i>
<i>the yellow and the orange</i>

29:53.208 --> 29:54.000
<i>and the red in the flame.</i>

29:54.083 --> 29:55.210
On females,
I tend to lean towards

29:55.293 --> 29:57.378
more pastels

29:57.462 --> 29:58.671
just to keep it
a little more delicate.

29:58.755 --> 29:59.839
Color can be light,

29:59.923 --> 30:00.548
<i>but it needs to be saturated</i>
<i>in the skin</i>

30:00.632 --> 30:02.926
<i>to where it's gonna stay.</i>

30:03.009 --> 30:04.802
Make it magnum.

30:04.886 --> 30:06.179
Get it in there.

30:06.262 --> 30:08.431
You're just missing
that ingredient.

30:10.141 --> 30:11.351
Tray.

30:12.435 --> 30:14.562
{\an1}A piston is something
that I'm used to doing.

30:14.646 --> 30:15.730
<i>I knew that I had to step it up</i>
<i>a little bit.</i>

30:15.813 --> 30:17.774
<i>You put a lot</i>
<i>of heavy blacks.</i>

30:17.857 --> 30:19.317
Lets your color really
stand out and be bright.

30:19.400 --> 30:22.237
{\an3}[Matt] <i> I wish you could've did</i>
<i>a little bit more</i> <i>with ,</i>

30:22.320 --> 30:23.738
<i>maybe to make that</i>
<i>come out a little bit more.</i>

30:23.821 --> 30:24.781
The tone you used,

30:24.864 --> 30:26.032
it didn't look strong,
it didn't stand out.

30:26.115 --> 30:29.494
<i>I think that's the weakest</i>
<i>element of this tattoo.</i>

30:30.954 --> 30:32.205
Tatu Baby.

30:32.288 --> 30:33.831
This is definitely
the best tattoo

30:33.915 --> 30:34.541
<i>that we've seen you do</i>
<i>so far.</i>

30:34.624 --> 30:37.085
<i>My only real criticism is</i>

30:37.168 --> 30:37.835
you used mostly muted yellows

30:37.919 --> 30:38.920
<i>and faded from Brown to yellow.</i>

30:39.003 --> 30:41.589
<i>There's not any</i>
<i>really bright yellows</i>

30:41.673 --> 30:43.091
<i>that really popped.</i>

30:43.174 --> 30:43.967
I like what you did.

30:44.050 --> 30:46.427
You need to do more of this.

30:46.511 --> 30:48.137
This is one of the few
new school tattoos

30:48.221 --> 30:49.097
that I would say,
"[bleep] it, I'll wear it."

30:49.180 --> 30:50.431
Thank you!

30:52.100 --> 30:54.018
Kay Kutta.

30:54.102 --> 30:55.645
He wanted skulls,
Tiki mask, something,

30:55.728 --> 30:56.729
<i>so I tried to combine</i>
<i>all of that.</i>

30:56.813 --> 30:58.606
[Chris] <i> You need black</i>
<i>somewhere in here</i>

30:58.690 --> 31:00.483
<i>if you're gonna have</i>
<i>such similar colors.</i>

31:00.567 --> 31:02.694
What's popping is the red
on the outside,

31:02.777 --> 31:05.029
<i>but it still kind of gets</i>
<i>jumbled in the middle.</i>

31:05.113 --> 31:07.323
<i>Some of your lighter colors</i>
<i>where the brown</i>

31:07.407 --> 31:08.449
<i>kind of fades to yellow</i>

31:08.533 --> 31:09.784
that it's just
kind of scratchy.

31:09.867 --> 31:12.203
A lot of the color
could've been a lot more solid.

31:13.746 --> 31:14.789
Sarah.

31:15.707 --> 31:17.125
I knew exactly
what I wanted to do.

31:17.208 --> 31:19.002
{\an5}<i>I had everything in my head.</i>

31:19.085 --> 31:20.044
<i>You put a lot of white,</i>

31:20.128 --> 31:21.212
<i>but you left a lot</i>
<i>of skin breaks,</i>

31:21.296 --> 31:22.714
<i>so as this thing ages,</i>

31:22.797 --> 31:24.007
it's gonna age nicely.

31:24.090 --> 31:25.300
<i>Even the colors you did that</i>
<i>aren't super vibrant,</i>

31:25.383 --> 31:27.468
they're done right.

31:27.552 --> 31:29.095
[Matt] <i> The detail, the color,</i>

31:29.178 --> 31:30.888
<i>the eyes, the hat.</i>

31:30.972 --> 31:32.682
You're definitely one
of the strongest competitors.

31:34.142 --> 31:35.059
Clint.

31:36.978 --> 31:38.062
My name is Clint Cummings

31:38.146 --> 31:39.355
<i>and that is</i>
<i>a Clint Cummings's tattoo.</i>

31:39.439 --> 31:40.648
<i>I've had my teeth kicked in</i>
<i>when it comes</i>

31:40.732 --> 31:42.650
to these designs, so this
is a breath of fresh air.

31:42.734 --> 31:44.319
I wish that you would've put
a little bit more thought

31:44.402 --> 31:46.070
<i>into placement and tried</i>
<i>to put that snail</i>

31:46.154 --> 31:47.155
<i>out of that crease</i>

31:47.238 --> 31:47.780
<i>'cause when he bends</i>
<i>his head back,</i>

31:47.864 --> 31:49.949
that snail's in the fold.

31:50.033 --> 31:51.075
Oh, hell.
Here we go.

31:51.159 --> 31:53.828
And I don't care if you guys
kick my teeth in or not.

31:53.911 --> 31:54.621
Nobody's here to kick
anybody's teeth in.

31:54.704 --> 31:56.581
We're playing for 100 grand.

31:56.664 --> 31:57.415
Here's the bottom line:

31:57.498 --> 31:59.709
You all signed up,
took many steps

31:59.792 --> 32:01.878
to get here
and hear critiques.

32:01.961 --> 32:04.839
These aren't, like,
coming out of nowhere.

32:04.922 --> 32:06.007
You ran the color.

32:06.090 --> 32:07.342
{\an1}<i>You stepped up.</i>
<i>And you did your thing.</i>

32:07.425 --> 32:08.343
<i>You gotta stop over-thinking.</i>

32:08.426 --> 32:10.261
<i>Just maintain your ride.</i>

32:10.345 --> 32:11.846
Don't go crazy.

32:13.348 --> 32:14.474
Jesse.

32:15.725 --> 32:16.976
This is your lane,
so this is what we expect.

32:17.060 --> 32:19.687
This is a clean, clean,
clean tattoo,

32:19.771 --> 32:22.106
and you really show off
this style.

32:22.190 --> 32:22.982
It's a great tattoo.

32:23.066 --> 32:24.567
<i>Caricature style,</i>
<i>the nose,</i>

32:24.651 --> 32:25.943
<i>to the fine detail</i>
<i>in the hair.</i>

32:26.027 --> 32:27.945
<i>Definitely one of my favorites</i>
<i>of the day.</i>

32:28.029 --> 32:29.030
{\an5}-You did a good job.

32:28.029 --> 32:29.030
-Thank you.

32:30.490 --> 32:32.742
Sebastian.
[groans]

32:32.825 --> 32:35.328
This is a hard act to follow
with the new school boys.

32:35.411 --> 32:38.873
This tattoo is the worst tattoo
I've seen you do.

32:38.956 --> 32:40.541
<i>The outline was chewed up.</i>

32:40.625 --> 32:41.793
<i>There was cuts in the bottom</i>
<i>in the beak.</i>

32:41.876 --> 32:42.710
[Sebastian] <i> Well,</i>
<i>I haven't really</i> <i>got to go,</i>

32:42.794 --> 32:44.587
"Hey, this is what I do."

32:44.671 --> 32:46.005
I want the battle to begin.

32:46.089 --> 32:47.715
I do not like this tattoo.

32:47.799 --> 32:49.425
<i>Look at that wing.</i>
<i>Look at that line.</i>

32:49.509 --> 32:50.468
<i>This isn't clean.</i>

32:52.804 --> 32:53.888
Lalo.

32:55.306 --> 32:57.058
She wanted a mermaid
that looked like her.

32:57.141 --> 32:58.559
[Oliver] <i> What is her skin color?</i>

32:58.643 --> 33:00.895
<i>This mermaid looks like she</i>
<i>was trapped in an oil spill.</i>

33:00.978 --> 33:01.813
The way I see it
is as light reflections,

33:01.896 --> 33:04.941
a lot of colors
bouncing off the skin.

33:05.024 --> 33:06.943
<i>[Oliver] You put all these</i>
<i>contrasting colors in there,</i>

33:07.026 --> 33:08.945
<i>but somehow have no contrast.</i>

33:09.028 --> 33:10.822
My main issues
are in the tail.

33:10.905 --> 33:13.408
<i>There's just little spots</i>
<i>of skin showing through.</i>

33:13.491 --> 33:15.618
I have a problem with that
because it's a matter of taste.

33:15.702 --> 33:18.246
[Oliver] <i> It's not a solid color.</i>

33:18.329 --> 33:19.872
<i>The saturation is just off.</i>

33:21.332 --> 33:22.375
Mark.

33:23.835 --> 33:25.461
You went down to the wire
with this one.

33:25.545 --> 33:27.255
Toughest canvas
I've had to work with,

33:27.338 --> 33:28.923
<i>and I just tried to make sure</i>
<i>I got it done.</i>

33:29.006 --> 33:30.258
<i>Once she started moving,</i>
<i>I was, like,</i>

33:30.341 --> 33:31.634
"Let me just get this
in there."

33:31.718 --> 33:32.677
It looked banged in.

33:32.760 --> 33:34.971
<i>The whole thing's patchy</i>
<i>and scratchy,</i>

33:35.054 --> 33:35.596
<i>especially up in</i>
<i>the Taurus symbol.</i>

33:35.680 --> 33:37.682
<i>In my opinion,</i>

33:37.765 --> 33:38.349
<i>I'd rather have it</i>
<i>looking like that</i>

33:38.433 --> 33:39.934
than just completely flat.

33:40.017 --> 33:41.519
You're [bleep] this up.

33:43.354 --> 33:44.439
Nick.

33:46.524 --> 33:49.026
{\an5}-Did she want a sacred heart?

33:46.524 --> 33:49.026
<i>-</i> [Nick] <i> She had 50 other ideas.</i>

33:49.110 --> 33:51.195
<i>This was the last thing</i>
<i>we had drawn up.</i>

33:51.279 --> 33:52.947
She was absolutely insane.

33:53.030 --> 33:54.115
In times like that,
you just have

33:54.198 --> 33:56.451
{\an5}-to be able to work with her.

33:54.198 --> 33:56.451
-I was just crazy.

33:56.534 --> 33:57.702
She was a little
off the wall.

33:57.785 --> 33:58.745
What's coming out
of the heart?

33:58.828 --> 34:00.163
{\an5}-Smoke.

33:58.828 --> 34:00.163
-Smoke?

34:00.246 --> 34:00.955
We really think
it looks like

34:01.038 --> 34:03.291
{\an5}-a used tissue.

34:01.038 --> 34:03.291
-[chuckles]

34:03.374 --> 34:05.293
Why would you put magenta
around a red heart?

34:05.376 --> 34:06.627
<i>I was just</i>
<i>under the impression</i>

34:06.711 --> 34:07.920
{\an5}<i>-new school was weird.</i>

34:06.711 --> 34:07.920
<i>-That's not right.</i>

34:08.004 --> 34:09.589
<i>[bleep]</i>
<i>It's done to be done.</i>

34:09.672 --> 34:11.007
When you do tattoos,
have a rhyme or a reason.

34:11.090 --> 34:13.717
You're [bleep]
your tattoo up.

34:13.801 --> 34:15.428
Unfortunately,
someone has to go home.

34:15.511 --> 34:16.888
I think this tattoo
drops you down a little bit,

34:16.971 --> 34:19.639
and it may put you
in that category.

34:22.018 --> 34:23.478
Head back to the loft.

34:23.561 --> 34:25.897
We'll call you back
when we've made a decision.

34:32.737 --> 34:34.781
I'm definitely nervous...

34:34.864 --> 34:37.366
Just 'cause my client
was crazy.

34:37.449 --> 34:38.951
{\an3}If somebody come in there
acting as [bleep] crazy

34:39.034 --> 34:41.161
as she did,
turn the machine up,

34:41.245 --> 34:42.663
tattoo a little slower,

34:42.746 --> 34:44.081
and see how long it take
for 'em to pass out

34:44.165 --> 34:46.333
from how bad it hurts.

34:46.417 --> 34:48.002
[Mark] Well, that's a technique
I'm not interested in learning.

34:48.085 --> 34:50.630
I'm not gonna go
heavy-handed on someone

34:50.713 --> 34:51.547
just because
they piss me off,

34:51.630 --> 34:54.091
because you're causing
extra skin trauma.

34:54.175 --> 34:56.052
I've tattooed
Long enough to know

34:56.135 --> 34:57.970
that you don't gotta [bleep] up
the skin to cause pain.

34:58.054 --> 35:00.681
You gonna be like,
"It hurts so bad."

35:00.765 --> 35:02.475
[chuckles]

35:02.558 --> 35:04.769
{\an1}No matter how much
I dislike my client,

35:04.852 --> 35:06.521
if you're causing them
more pain,

35:06.604 --> 35:08.147
you're inflicting
something that's wrong.

35:08.231 --> 35:09.816
You don't gotta
overwork the skin, Mark.

35:09.899 --> 35:11.067
How many times
I gotta say that?

35:11.150 --> 35:13.027
If you turn up
the speed of the machine--

35:13.110 --> 35:15.404
no, damn it,
you can move a little slower,

35:15.488 --> 35:16.656
and it causes it
to hurt more

35:16.739 --> 35:18.157
and you still
don't damage the skin.

35:18.241 --> 35:19.534
Man, you're--
you know what?

35:19.617 --> 35:21.536
I don't argue
with silliness, man.

35:21.619 --> 35:23.496
I'm sorry
if I lay what you said

35:23.579 --> 35:24.914
in front of you
on the table

35:24.997 --> 35:26.874
and you're trying to tell me,
"That's not what I said."

35:26.958 --> 35:28.668
I didn't say [bleep]
about "That's not what I said."

35:28.751 --> 35:30.378
I said it
out of my damn mouth.

35:30.461 --> 35:32.046
"That's what I said."

35:32.129 --> 35:33.047
Okay.

35:33.130 --> 35:36.259
I will straight choke you
the [bleep] out.

35:39.971 --> 35:42.348
All tattoos
are uncomfortable.

35:42.431 --> 35:43.683
{\an5}-Now you said you get--

35:42.431 --> 35:43.683
-So if you--

35:43.766 --> 35:47.562
<i>If you go out of your way</i>
<i>to cause more--</i>

35:47.645 --> 35:49.897
to cause more discomfort,

35:49.981 --> 35:51.899
then yes, you're [bleep] up
the tattoo!

35:51.983 --> 35:53.401
-No. Yes or no?
-Yes! Yes!

35:53.484 --> 35:56.404
If you go out of your way
to increase the discomfort

35:56.487 --> 35:59.699
just because you dislike
the way your client's acting,

35:59.782 --> 36:01.993
that's not really
an honorable mode of tattooing.

36:02.076 --> 36:04.161
What I've been saying
the whole time

36:04.245 --> 36:05.580
is it's possible
to do that

36:05.663 --> 36:06.831
without [bleep] up
the tattoo.

36:06.914 --> 36:08.207
You're saying
it's impossible to do it.

36:08.291 --> 36:09.458
You shouldn't be tattooing

36:09.542 --> 36:11.210
if you're gonna
be dishonorable on something

36:11.294 --> 36:13.588
you're putting on somebody
for the rest of their life.

36:13.671 --> 36:15.882
You're talking
about bull[bleep], bro.

36:16.716 --> 36:19.093
Alright, guys,
new school, color.

36:19.176 --> 36:20.928
<i>Sarah killed it, I think,</i>
<i>on this raptor detective.</i>

36:21.012 --> 36:23.848
She put heavy blacks,
color's solid.

36:23.931 --> 36:26.058
{\an1}I just think it's great
how she took the criticism

36:26.142 --> 36:26.934
from the day before,
and came back the next day,

36:27.018 --> 36:28.603
arguably put out
the best tattoo.

36:28.686 --> 36:30.605
[Dave] Jesse?

36:30.688 --> 36:31.397
[Chris] This kid can put in
solid color.

36:31.480 --> 36:33.107
[Dave] <i> Unbelievably well done</i> .

36:33.190 --> 36:35.151
I just like the palette
in Sarah's better.

36:35.234 --> 36:38.279
Nobody's color
is that smooth, nobody's.

36:40.448 --> 36:41.282
Mark?

36:41.365 --> 36:42.575
<i>The client</i>
<i>really did rattle him.</i>

36:42.658 --> 36:43.492
<i>His outline was way off</i>
<i>on this tattoo.</i>

36:43.576 --> 36:45.953
Super rough,
it's Mark's worst tattoo.

36:46.037 --> 36:47.872
{\an5}-Nick?

36:46.037 --> 36:47.872
-The design is ugly.

36:47.955 --> 36:48.706
The color
is packed in there.

36:48.789 --> 36:50.791
The outline is terrible.

36:50.875 --> 36:53.127
The client
was very, very difficult.

36:53.210 --> 36:54.795
Having said that,
it wasn't like

36:54.879 --> 36:57.506
she was squirming and crying
and jumping all over.

36:57.590 --> 37:00.134
He just got mentally
taken out of the zone.

37:00.217 --> 37:01.677
[Chris] <i> This guy took</i>
<i>the simplest tattoo</i>

37:01.761 --> 37:03.679
<i>you can possibly do</i>
<i>in a competition,</i>

37:03.763 --> 37:04.305
<i>and then botched it.</i>

37:04.388 --> 37:06.265
<i>He just has no concept</i>

37:06.349 --> 37:07.266
of where anything goes
in a tattoo,

37:07.350 --> 37:09.810
other than to fill in
the hollow space.

37:09.894 --> 37:11.938
[Dave] <i> Lalo's mermaid?</i>

37:12.021 --> 37:13.064
[Oliver] <i> The color is just weak.</i>

37:13.147 --> 37:15.483
Come on, man,
this is a competition.

37:15.566 --> 37:18.235
<i>To go put these colors</i>
<i>with nothing strong</i>

37:18.319 --> 37:19.612
<i>next to 'em</i>
<i>for the contrast,</i>

37:19.695 --> 37:21.447
Lalo [bleep] the bed.

37:21.530 --> 37:23.574
So I think
it's pretty safe to say

37:23.658 --> 37:25.326
Nick's in the bottom,
Mark's in the bottom,

37:25.409 --> 37:26.619
Lalo's in the bottom.

37:26.702 --> 37:29.830
Are you guys thinking that
if Nick packed in the color

37:29.914 --> 37:31.540
<i>on Lalo's design, we'd have</i>
<i>one good, solid tattoo?</i>

37:31.624 --> 37:35.336
<i>I don't think Nick knows</i>
<i>where to shade Lalo's design.</i>

37:35.419 --> 37:36.253
But I think Nick
could actually

37:36.337 --> 37:39.257
put the color in
more solid than Lalo.

37:39.340 --> 37:40.841
This is a tough call, man.

37:40.925 --> 37:41.509
{\an5}-Do you wanna go get 'em?

37:40.925 --> 37:41.509
-I'll do it.

37:41.592 --> 37:42.426
Let's get this thing done.

37:46.138 --> 37:47.890
[door closes]

37:47.974 --> 37:49.016
The judges need to see

37:49.100 --> 37:54.647
Jesse, Lalo, Nick,
and Sarah.

37:55.356 --> 37:56.399
Sarah.

37:56.482 --> 37:57.942
Queen and king going.

37:58.025 --> 37:59.360
Good-bye, everybody.

37:59.443 --> 38:00.528
Good luck.
[laughs]

38:10.913 --> 38:13.249
Two of you impressed us
with your use of color,

38:13.332 --> 38:13.874
and two of you did not.

38:13.958 --> 38:16.293
Jesse, Sarah,

38:16.377 --> 38:19.547
you had the top tattoos
of the day.

38:19.630 --> 38:21.048
The judges have decided

38:21.132 --> 38:22.800
the best tattoo
of the day...

38:26.303 --> 38:26.846
...goes to Sarah.

38:26.929 --> 38:29.223
Good job, Sarah.

38:29.306 --> 38:30.433
[Chris] You came back.

38:30.516 --> 38:32.601
You did exactly
what we were looking for.

38:32.685 --> 38:35.563
Clean, solid, bold,
bright color.

38:35.646 --> 38:36.939
You did a great job.

38:37.023 --> 38:39.984
Lalo and Nick,
you did not impress the judges

38:40.067 --> 38:41.068
with your use of color.

38:41.152 --> 38:42.570
That can only mean that
you two are on the bottom.

38:42.653 --> 38:44.822
Nick.

38:44.905 --> 38:46.449
Your tattoo was
the most simple thing

38:46.532 --> 38:48.909
<i>you could've possibly done,</i>
<i>ever.</i>

38:48.993 --> 38:49.577
I wish you
could understand.

38:49.660 --> 38:50.536
I tried my hardest on this.

38:50.619 --> 38:52.538
With what I was dealing with
with her,

38:52.621 --> 38:53.122
it was literally impossible.

38:53.205 --> 38:53.998
You're not changing it!

38:54.081 --> 38:56.500
And that's what
this is about.

38:56.584 --> 38:57.793
{\an5}-You're not changing it.

38:56.584 --> 38:57.793
-I will change it.

38:57.877 --> 38:58.836
I can't change it
in that way.

38:58.919 --> 39:01.630
Because it's your work?
Is that what this is?

39:01.714 --> 39:02.757
I can't even believe
there's a tattoo

39:02.840 --> 39:03.966
on skin to show you guys,

39:04.050 --> 39:05.509
'cause she was
an impossible client.

39:05.593 --> 39:08.846
You did the most
apprentice-drawn tattoo

39:08.929 --> 39:10.222
of everybody.

39:10.306 --> 39:12.099
If I would've done
what she wanted--

39:12.183 --> 39:13.517
like,
this is me changing it.

39:13.601 --> 39:14.435
I did the thicker outlines.

39:14.518 --> 39:15.770
I tried to make it
new school.

39:15.853 --> 39:16.604
You know,
in our profession, you know,

39:16.687 --> 39:18.272
Dave and I,
we're stepping out

39:18.355 --> 39:19.815
in front of the world
every night.

39:19.899 --> 39:21.275
Whether I'm playing with
a bad ankle

39:21.358 --> 39:23.611
or a broken finger
on my shooting hand,

39:23.694 --> 39:25.112
none of that
[bleep] matters.

39:25.196 --> 39:26.614
All they care about
is my numbers.

39:26.697 --> 39:27.907
And whether he's sick,

39:27.990 --> 39:28.741
all they care about
is the music.

39:28.824 --> 39:29.909
You know,
at the end of the day,

39:29.992 --> 39:31.827
all these people are gonna
care about is the tattoo.

39:31.911 --> 39:33.037
What you're doing is staying
on these people's bodies

39:33.120 --> 39:34.538
for the rest
of their lives.

39:36.207 --> 39:37.541
This is our dilemma.

39:37.625 --> 39:39.168
This challenge particularly
is about color.

39:39.251 --> 39:41.003
How much weight
do we put on that

39:41.087 --> 39:42.421
versus how bad
this design Is?

39:42.505 --> 39:43.631
Lalo's design
is very creative

39:43.714 --> 39:46.258
<i>and very well drawn,</i>
<i>but very poorly executed.</i>

39:46.342 --> 39:48.219
I might be shooting myself
on the foot,

39:48.302 --> 39:51.472
but, like, I really
like this tattoo.

39:52.515 --> 39:53.474
[Oliver] <i> The outline is weak.</i>

39:53.557 --> 39:54.975
<i>There's not any</i>
<i>real solid black.</i>

39:55.059 --> 39:56.310
<i>And the color's not bright.</i>

39:56.393 --> 39:57.978
I know some lines
could have been better.

39:58.062 --> 39:59.146
You're in the bottom
right now

39:59.230 --> 40:00.815
because you did the lightest,
weakest colors

40:00.898 --> 40:02.358
on the day
of the color challenge.

40:02.441 --> 40:04.193
I don't really believe
that I put out

40:04.276 --> 40:05.778
a fully bad tattoo
in the context

40:05.861 --> 40:06.654
of our competition.

40:06.737 --> 40:08.906
The choice in color
that you made

40:08.989 --> 40:10.116
<i>doesn't have punch to it.</i>

40:10.199 --> 40:12.159
<i>It doesn't have</i>
<i>that solid field of color.</i>

40:12.243 --> 40:14.662
<i>It bothers</i>
<i>the [bleep] out of me.</i>

40:14.745 --> 40:16.497
You're a better tattooer
than what you're tattooing.

40:19.458 --> 40:20.501
The judges have decided...

40:27.383 --> 40:29.677
Nick, you do not
have what it takes

40:29.760 --> 40:30.678
to be <i> Ink Master</i> .

40:30.761 --> 40:33.431
This is not an easy task,
trying to compare

40:33.514 --> 40:35.808
all the different elements
of the tattoos,

40:35.891 --> 40:36.767
different
experience levels,

40:36.851 --> 40:39.145
and what we see
for the future.

40:39.228 --> 40:40.813
{\an1}At the end of the day,
we gotta let somebody go.

40:40.896 --> 40:42.982
I need you
to pack up your machines

40:43.065 --> 40:44.692
and go home.

40:44.775 --> 40:45.860
I would still
be in the competition

40:45.943 --> 40:47.069
if I got a canvas
that was more open.

40:47.153 --> 40:48.487
<i>My canvas is definitely</i>
<i>the reason I'm going home.</i>

40:48.571 --> 40:50.906
I didn't know
how to put up with her.

40:50.990 --> 40:52.366
<i>The whole thing</i>
<i>is just upsetting.</i>

40:52.449 --> 40:53.951
<i>It just sucks that I had to be</i>
<i>put out of the competition</i>

40:54.034 --> 40:55.286
because of that.

40:57.288 --> 40:59.707
{\an8}[narrator] <i> On the next episode</i>
<i>of</i> Ink Master...

40:59.790 --> 41:00.708
{\an8}[Dave] <i> Welcome to Coney island.</i>

41:00.791 --> 41:04.420
{\an8}You must tattoo
the inside of the mouth.

41:04.503 --> 41:06.630
{\an8}[all whimpering]

41:06.714 --> 41:09.800
{\an8}You just basically told me
"You deserve to go downstairs."

41:09.884 --> 41:11.218
{\an8}Well, to be honest,
I do think

41:11.302 --> 41:12.428
{\an8}that you deserve
to go downstairs.

41:12.511 --> 41:14.513
{\an8}[yelling] Are you
letting me finish talking?

41:14.597 --> 41:16.056
{\an8}There's not a competitor
that should

41:16.140 --> 41:17.016
{\an8}have any confidence
right now.

41:17.099 --> 41:18.225
{\an8}This is not
<i>Ink Master</i> anything.

41:18.309 --> 41:20.811
{\an8}The ugly [bleep]
could go home.

41:20.895 --> 41:23.689
{\an8}He blew out his intestine
before he came here.

41:23.772 --> 41:25.065
{\an8}You could die like that.

41:25.149 --> 41:27.067
{\an8}Dude!
[siren wails]
