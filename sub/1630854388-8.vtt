WEBVTT

00:06.881 --> 00:12.387
He earned a pretty good bonus this year,
so now Aaron is on a billboard.

00:12.470 --> 00:15.098
"I know where you'll live"?
Your husband's kind of a creep.

00:15.181 --> 00:19.185
I advised against that slogan,
but he was so excited it wasn't taken.

00:19.269 --> 00:23.898
He thinks it's so memorable,
it will drive traffic to the business.

00:23.982 --> 00:25.233
I think that's smart,

00:25.316 --> 00:28.069
but he should be towering
over the whole city.

00:28.153 --> 00:31.114
The taller the person is,
the more I trust them.

00:31.197 --> 00:33.700
He's gonna have bigger things
to worry about,

00:33.783 --> 00:35.869
-like someone drawing a dick.
-Someone drawing a dick.

00:35.952 --> 00:38.955
That happened out of the gate.
I took these in between cleanings.

00:39.039 --> 00:42.709
Let's just say,
there's been a diversity of genitalia.

00:42.792 --> 00:44.586
Say hello to my little friend.

00:44.669 --> 00:46.588
-No.
-Sorry.

00:48.590 --> 00:51.134
-Oh, must not have locked it.
-What's that?

00:51.217 --> 00:55.013
-Cash money. Dollar bills.
-I'll leave before he starts rapping.

00:55.096 --> 00:56.264
She knows me well.

00:56.347 --> 00:58.058
This here is some petty cash

00:58.141 --> 01:01.352
because I have been a TI-89 calculator
with the books.

01:02.353 --> 01:03.438
We're in the black!

01:03.521 --> 01:04.689
-Really?
-Wow!

01:04.773 --> 01:08.735
Yeah. I thought it would take longer for
us to have enough money for a rainy day

01:08.818 --> 01:12.197
or enough to make it rain!

01:12.280 --> 01:13.406
Yeah.

01:16.201 --> 01:17.952
I'll clean it up, sorry.

01:26.544 --> 01:27.587
Knock, knock.

01:27.670 --> 01:29.756
That's never been how to knock.

01:29.839 --> 01:32.717
I cashed my last four checks this morning.

01:32.801 --> 01:36.471
Had you misplaced them
or did you forget somehow, and why four?

01:36.554 --> 01:38.973
-Why today?
-I've always done it this way.

01:39.057 --> 01:42.811
I save $3 per year
by only driving to the bank once a month.

01:42.894 --> 01:46.272
What a neat thing
to learn just now.

01:46.356 --> 01:49.734
I really need you
to deposit the checks as you get them.

01:49.818 --> 01:51.111
That seems weird.

01:51.694 --> 01:54.364
That rainy day came faster than I thought.

01:54.447 --> 01:56.658
Excuse me, I need to call the bank.

01:56.741 --> 02:00.286
You do know you can use your phone
to deposit a check, right?

02:00.370 --> 02:01.871
Phone data costs more.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.498
You could pay me in quarters.

02:03.581 --> 02:04.624
It'll go a lot further

02:04.707 --> 02:08.336
because the solar storm will reduce
us down to bartering our precious metals.

02:08.419 --> 02:10.922
You gotta stop listening
to your dad's trucker radio.

02:11.005 --> 02:13.133
Never! We live by road rules.

02:13.216 --> 02:15.343
Hmm. Glad we did this.

02:15.426 --> 02:17.512
If you're doing
an Andy Serkis retrospective,

02:17.595 --> 02:21.391
I'd start with <i>13 Going on 30</i>
and then move to <i>Lord of the Rings.</i>

02:21.474 --> 02:23.726
He transforms that little body of his.

02:24.310 --> 02:26.396
Excuse me. I'm looking for the movie
where Adam Sandler

02:26.479 --> 02:28.189
becomes the people whose shoes he wears.

02:28.273 --> 02:30.817
Oh, yeah, that's <i>The Cob--</i> Nope.

02:33.361 --> 02:36.072
I'll explain the plot of <i>Con Air</i>
in one second.

02:43.079 --> 02:45.748
-That's Aaron's Erin, right?
-Yep, Girl Erin.

02:45.832 --> 02:49.502
I practiced what I would say to her
a million times,

02:49.586 --> 02:51.963
and then I just... froze.

02:52.046 --> 02:54.674
I just knew I had seen that stupid face

02:54.757 --> 02:57.343
next to a "be the light
that guides your own path" pillow.

02:57.427 --> 02:59.220
Guess what, you homewrecker?

02:59.304 --> 03:02.307
You don't have to be a yoga master
to do downward dog.

03:02.390 --> 03:04.350
Stop posting photos of it!

03:05.852 --> 03:07.228
You follow her on Facebook?

03:07.312 --> 03:10.106
I've kept tabs on her
since you told me Aaron slept with her.

03:10.899 --> 03:13.693
I would just die
if my Raul ever cheated on me.

03:16.112 --> 03:18.573
-I'm always here for you, <i>mija.</i>
-Thanks.

03:20.366 --> 03:22.702
I created a fake account to follow her.

03:23.286 --> 03:26.456
I've reported all her posts
for the past six months.

03:26.539 --> 03:30.543
On the bright side,
you're so much older and wiser than her.

03:32.253 --> 03:33.421
-What?
-<i>I'm Lee Imbibo,</i>

03:33.504 --> 03:36.549
<i>filling in for Regina Rosenchurch</i>
<i>who's on vacation.</i>

03:36.633 --> 03:40.220
<i>Today's top story</i>
<i>is the storm of the digital century.</i>

03:40.303 --> 03:43.306
<i>Experts are saying</i>
<i>a solar storm is on the horizon</i>

03:43.389 --> 03:46.809
<i>and could knock out Internet service</i>
<i>for an undetermined amount of time...</i>

03:46.893 --> 03:50.230
Yeah. Right. A world without the Internet.

03:50.313 --> 03:54.901
Would Mark Zuckerberg turn to ash?
Your dad might be right about the storm.

03:54.984 --> 03:58.029
His natural disaster accuracy
is about 60 percent,

03:58.112 --> 04:02.158
but apparently he can't see
the disaster he created for me.

04:03.201 --> 04:04.661
Did he park on a squirrel again?

04:04.744 --> 04:06.955
I was preparing to apply
for community college.

04:07.038 --> 04:11.042
Had all my paperwork ready.
It was gonna be my Elle Woods moment.

04:11.125 --> 04:13.628
I even put in my adoption papers
for a chihuahua.

04:13.711 --> 04:15.088
I love you, but get there faster.

04:15.171 --> 04:19.259
It turns out, my forgetful father
never filed my home-school paperwork.

04:19.342 --> 04:21.302
I had to tell
Chihuahua and Muchachas Rescue

04:21.386 --> 04:24.973
that I couldn't take the dog,
because I wasn't a high school graduate.

04:25.056 --> 04:27.433
It was the one thing I could brag about.

04:27.517 --> 04:29.185
You have a lot to be proud of.

04:29.269 --> 04:32.230
Like? My fifth degree black belt?
Yeah, Carlos.

04:32.313 --> 04:36.317
People are real impressed that
I dedicated most of my life to karate.

04:36.401 --> 04:38.861
There's gotta be a way you can enroll.

04:38.945 --> 04:42.282
The counselor said if I pass
the placement exam, then I can enroll.

04:42.365 --> 04:44.409
-Do that.
-The deadline is tonight.

04:44.492 --> 04:47.203
I can't brush up
on all of high school by tonight.

04:48.204 --> 04:49.455
What am I gonna do?

04:49.539 --> 04:53.251
Ever since I had shrimp nachos,
my tastes have become first-class,

04:53.334 --> 04:55.086
and I want more in life,

04:55.169 --> 04:58.840
including going to the shrimp nachos
of the educational system:

04:58.923 --> 05:00.383
community college.

05:02.885 --> 05:05.430
I'm headed there now
to make a cash deposit.

05:05.513 --> 05:06.681
<i>Sir, if you don't come--</i>

05:06.764 --> 05:10.852
I understand vendor checks will bounce,
but it will not come to that.

05:10.935 --> 05:12.603
<i>Would you take a five-minute survey?</i>

05:12.687 --> 05:16.232
No, I would not like to take
a five-minute survey about this call.

05:21.529 --> 05:22.363
Hello?

05:23.072 --> 05:26.784
You should know I took
three Krav Maga classes at the YMCA.

05:31.622 --> 05:34.792
Hey, are you okay? What happened?

05:38.796 --> 05:40.715
-If you need to go home...
-Mm-mm.

05:42.091 --> 05:45.219
-Do you wanna tell me what's going on?
-No, thank you.

05:48.181 --> 05:49.682
Do you want to be alone?

05:51.184 --> 05:54.562
You wanna maybe go to The Donk
and get shit-faced drunk?

05:56.606 --> 05:58.066
Can my doughnuts come?

05:58.649 --> 05:59.984
Of course they can.

06:05.114 --> 06:06.824
-Put it on my tab.
-No.

06:06.908 --> 06:08.451
This one's on Blockbuster.

06:09.994 --> 06:13.831
Are you sure you should have that in here?
I've had my jacket stolen from this place.

06:13.915 --> 06:14.874
Not a problem.

06:14.957 --> 06:17.960
Just think of it
as a highly secure metal purse.

06:18.044 --> 06:19.337
I mean, wallet.

06:19.420 --> 06:23.883
Well, I've never said this to anyone,
but I appreciate you getting me drunk.

06:23.966 --> 06:26.928
Is it creepy to say "my pleasure"?
It's creepy.

06:27.011 --> 06:31.099
I have nothing else but this.
I just need to get to the bank by close.

06:32.433 --> 06:34.060
So, what's going on?

06:34.143 --> 06:36.854
My life is not what I thought it would be.

06:36.938 --> 06:40.566
Ugh. "Oh, I just love
posting inspirational quotes,

06:40.650 --> 06:43.945
and I love to post selfies
when I stage houses."

06:44.028 --> 06:48.116
Who goes to one free yoga class
and then puts a Buddha in every room?

06:48.199 --> 06:51.702
Go rent your DVDs from the dumpster,
you bag of trash.

06:51.786 --> 06:53.496
Girl Erin came into Blockbuster?

06:53.579 --> 06:56.165
I know there aren't other video stores,

06:56.249 --> 06:59.043
but she should've thought of that
before dating a married man.

06:59.127 --> 07:01.337
Gosh. I'm so sorry. That blows.

07:02.463 --> 07:03.798
Well, to better times.

07:11.764 --> 07:13.724
Damn. How was it?

07:13.808 --> 07:15.560
Delicious. I'll have another.

07:16.436 --> 07:17.728
Enjoy <i>Wild Hogs.</i>

07:17.812 --> 07:20.314
But don't go into it
expecting actual pigs,

07:20.398 --> 07:22.900
they are completely shut out of this film.

07:22.984 --> 07:25.820
-Okay.
-Hannah. Guess what's in my hands now?

07:25.903 --> 07:29.866
-Is Bennigan's back? Is that their menu?
-Do they have loaded baked potato soup?

07:29.949 --> 07:33.035
No, but-- You were with me
when I printed this out.

07:33.119 --> 07:33.953
Oh, man.

07:34.036 --> 07:37.415
This is a practice placement exam
for community college.

07:37.999 --> 07:40.543
I looked the questions over, it's doable.

07:40.626 --> 07:42.545
You may have to brush up
on a few subjects,

07:42.628 --> 07:44.130
but you could take it and pass.

07:44.213 --> 07:46.299
-Can't you Google the answers?
-It's monitored.

07:46.382 --> 07:48.426
I can't get in trouble with the NSA again.

07:48.509 --> 07:52.013
I have to study up on 12 years
with six subjects a year.

07:52.096 --> 07:53.890
That's 72 subjects.

07:53.973 --> 07:55.099
You did that math fast.

07:55.183 --> 07:57.560
You're way smarter
than you give yourself credit for.

07:57.643 --> 07:59.812
And you won't be alone in studying.

07:59.896 --> 08:02.023
-You got me and Connie to help you.
-Really?

08:02.106 --> 08:05.026
Yes, really.
We're gonna <i>Billy Madison </i>you.

08:07.778 --> 08:10.114
I got back together with Aaron for Ali,

08:10.198 --> 08:13.201
but when am I gonna
start doing things for myself?

08:13.284 --> 08:17.079
No one tells you one tiny moment
in an otherwise very average day

08:17.163 --> 08:20.458
can make you question
every decision you've ever made.

08:21.751 --> 08:25.129
You know, whenever my parents
would get into a huge fight,

08:25.213 --> 08:26.797
which happened a lot,

08:26.881 --> 08:30.384
my mom could tell I was sad,
and she'd try to make up for it

08:30.468 --> 08:34.013
by taking me out for what she would call
a "Special Guy Day."

08:34.514 --> 08:36.807
I think you could use a Special Guy Day.

08:36.891 --> 08:39.352
Doesn't your special guy
work at the bass shop?

08:40.895 --> 08:42.480
Look, I'm trying to help.

08:42.563 --> 08:45.149
After a Special Guy Day,
I'd always feel better,

08:45.233 --> 08:46.692
You will too. Trust me.

08:46.776 --> 08:49.987
I just don't feel
like I'm capable of fun right now.

08:50.071 --> 08:52.615
When everything was open around town,

08:52.698 --> 08:56.202
my mom and I would hit up
the amusement park, ride go-karts,

08:56.285 --> 08:57.370
we'd eat non-stop,

08:57.453 --> 08:59.956
anything to make
Mommy's special guy happy.

09:00.039 --> 09:03.084
But, oh, man,
the amusement park shut down.

09:03.167 --> 09:07.296
So... feels like sitting here drinking
is probably the move.

09:07.380 --> 09:10.841
There are plenty of things
around the strip mall we can do,

09:10.925 --> 09:14.470
and let's get started with a very hot jam.

09:16.305 --> 09:17.390
This is stupid.

09:17.473 --> 09:22.144
That's the spirit. Sometimes my mom
would even take me out of school early,

09:22.228 --> 09:24.897
so I am giving you
the rest of the day off.

09:24.981 --> 09:28.109
-I was already done with my shift.
-You are welcome.

09:29.819 --> 09:31.904
-All right, here we go.

09:32.530 --> 09:34.073
A Special Guy Day classic.

09:37.118 --> 09:40.746
If Dominic Toretto and Luke Hobbs
are going to Rio De Janeiro,

09:40.830 --> 09:44.333
but Toretto leaves São Paulo at 3 p.m.
driving 90 miles an hour,

09:44.417 --> 09:47.169
and Hobbes leaves São Paulo at noon
driving 65 miles an hour.

09:47.253 --> 09:48.212
Who gets there first?

09:48.296 --> 09:51.424
Luke Hobbs would rather die
than drive the speed limit.

09:51.507 --> 09:53.301
-True.
-Why are we here?

09:53.384 --> 09:55.845
Special Guy Day meant a trip to the mall,

09:55.928 --> 09:58.180
but our mall's now a methadone clinic.

09:58.264 --> 10:01.892
-We have Amber and her fashions.
-I saved these just for you.

10:01.976 --> 10:04.228
-Ooh!
-The fireworks pattern's really fun.

10:04.312 --> 10:05.980
So you've been here before?

10:06.063 --> 10:09.817
-Timmy's a regular.
-The compression makes me feel safe.

10:10.735 --> 10:14.363
My mom used to get me a banana split
at Beth Ann Creamery.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.032
So good she cried while eating it,

10:16.115 --> 10:18.951
but it got bought out
by a year-round Spirit Halloween store.

10:19.035 --> 10:21.370
But look! Bar Banana Splits.

10:21.454 --> 10:23.748
Oh! Cheers!

10:24.707 --> 10:28.669
Oh! How is it sweeter
than an actual banana split?

10:28.753 --> 10:30.129
My fillings!

10:32.214 --> 10:35.217
the longer,
higher-budget sequel to World War I,

10:35.301 --> 10:37.887
was started in September of 1939--

10:38.387 --> 10:40.681
Oh, my God, I love him!

10:40.765 --> 10:42.016
-Tom Hanks?
-No.

10:42.099 --> 10:43.434
-Tom Sizemore?
-Who?

10:43.517 --> 10:46.354
-Carlos, don't guess.
-That's a real person.

10:46.437 --> 10:47.855
-He's famous.
-Matt Damon?

10:47.938 --> 10:49.732
He did a show dressed like a lady.

10:49.815 --> 10:51.359
-Barry Pepper?
-Went to the moon.

10:51.442 --> 10:53.027
-Ed Burns.
-Taught ladies baseball.

10:53.110 --> 10:57.073
-Tom Hanks!
-Yes, him! I love him. Thanks, Hannah.

10:57.156 --> 11:00.159
Here we go.
You think this thing gives change?

11:00.242 --> 11:05.623
And it doesn't, but I think if we get that
stripeless zebra there, it'll be worth it.

11:05.706 --> 11:07.208
You mean horse, drunky?

11:07.708 --> 11:09.210
Trying to concentrate.

11:09.835 --> 11:13.339
Right. Keep going right.
And then my left. Your left, right?

11:13.422 --> 11:16.425
Then left, and then--
No, right, and a little left.

11:16.509 --> 11:19.095
I love that you're feeling better.
Hate the backseat driving.

11:19.178 --> 11:21.639
Okay, up, but like in a down way.

11:22.306 --> 11:23.265
A duck!

11:24.725 --> 11:26.936
Does that duck have a human dick?

11:27.019 --> 11:28.145
Indeed it does.

11:29.021 --> 11:30.815
-This calls for another drink.
-On me.

11:32.566 --> 11:33.943
To human-dick ducks!

11:34.610 --> 11:37.863
So Rex here, not a human,
but the anatomy is the same.

11:37.947 --> 11:40.866
-You've got lungs, heart...

11:40.950 --> 11:42.159
...liver, spleen,

11:42.243 --> 11:44.286
gallbladder, pancreas.

11:44.370 --> 11:46.414
Why does it make that sound?

11:46.997 --> 11:48.416
<i>And now time for photos.</i>

11:49.083 --> 11:50.209
Oh, no. I got it.

11:52.795 --> 11:55.589
-Oh. Yep.
-I'll just-- How about--?

11:55.673 --> 11:56.507
-Yep.
-Okay.

11:57.007 --> 11:58.008
Okay.

11:59.218 --> 12:01.345
We have the whole world at our fingertips.

12:01.429 --> 12:04.682
What the--?
Are all these backgrounds our strip mall?

12:04.765 --> 12:06.475
That is so depressing.

12:06.559 --> 12:08.811
-Oh, let's do the dumpster.
-Okay.

12:16.610 --> 12:17.737
Shh, shh...

12:18.821 --> 12:21.115
She's gotta be almost done
with the practice test.

12:21.198 --> 12:23.576
-How do you think she's doing?
-Biting her upper lip,

12:23.659 --> 12:27.329
means she's focused or
she's eating her Dr. Pepper Lip Smacker.

12:27.997 --> 12:28.831
Go, go, go.

12:33.544 --> 12:35.296
Act natural! Natural!

12:38.674 --> 12:41.552
Oh, hey. So how did you score?

12:41.635 --> 12:43.262
Ah...

12:45.347 --> 12:46.557
You failed?

12:46.640 --> 12:48.100
But you were so prepared.

12:48.184 --> 12:51.395
You didn't even spell your name right.
"Hannah" doesn't have four N's.

12:51.479 --> 12:52.438
I froze.

12:52.521 --> 12:54.315
I was under so much pressure,

12:54.398 --> 12:57.818
and the break room was so quiet,
I could hear my thoughts.

12:57.902 --> 13:00.362
We made sure it was quiet
so you could focus.

13:00.446 --> 13:02.031
I'm not used to that.

13:02.114 --> 13:04.950
When I did my home-school tests,
nothing changed.

13:05.034 --> 13:07.828
My dad would yell at the TV
while he burned dinner.

13:07.912 --> 13:10.289
My neighbor blared his car horn.
Trains went by.

13:10.372 --> 13:12.458
My cat did this reverse cough thing.

13:12.541 --> 13:15.044
Oh, my God.

13:15.127 --> 13:17.880
Even talking about it relaxes me.

13:17.963 --> 13:20.591
I find most white ladies boring,
but not you.

13:20.674 --> 13:22.468
No, actually that makes sense.

13:22.551 --> 13:26.722
You were so distracted by everything,
you had no time to worry about the test.

13:26.806 --> 13:29.975
I wish I could recreate it,
but my dad doesn't watch sports anymore,

13:30.059 --> 13:32.102
and that neighbor drowned
in a deep puddle.

13:32.186 --> 13:35.147
I bet we could recreate it.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.317
<i>I'm on my way with the deposit.</i>

13:38.400 --> 13:40.694
I am so sorry, but something came up.

13:40.778 --> 13:45.282
It was a family emergency diarrhea thing.

13:46.700 --> 13:48.494
Weird, it happened to you too.

13:48.577 --> 13:52.790
Okay, well, I am on my way now
with all of the money,

13:52.873 --> 13:54.500
or most of it.

13:54.583 --> 13:58.087
Hypothetically, if I didn't have
enough cash to cover the vendor checks,

13:58.170 --> 14:00.005
is that a huge problem, among friends?

14:00.089 --> 14:01.298
Tim-A!

14:01.382 --> 14:02.216
Hey!

14:02.716 --> 14:03.801
Thank you.

14:03.884 --> 14:06.011
I didn't know that I needed it,

14:06.095 --> 14:08.722
but now that I know
about Special Guy Day,

14:08.806 --> 14:10.349
I'm like, yeah!

14:10.975 --> 14:12.643
-I needed this.
-I get it.

14:12.726 --> 14:14.728
Basically saved me as a kid.

14:14.812 --> 14:17.857
But Special Guy Day
got weirder as I got older.

14:17.940 --> 14:21.652
Turned into me doing things with my mom
she should have been doing with my dad.

14:21.735 --> 14:24.780
A lot of sitting in dressing rooms
while she tried on dresses,

14:24.864 --> 14:28.033
went to see <i>Swan Lake,</i>
which was actually pretty cool.

14:28.117 --> 14:30.119
One of the dancers broke her leg.

14:30.202 --> 14:33.205
-Yikes.
-We even took a couples cooking class.

14:33.289 --> 14:36.292
-With your mother?
-Wait for it. Bam.

14:36.375 --> 14:38.502
-No! Wow!

14:38.586 --> 14:41.589
Seems like she needed you
more than you needed her.

14:42.089 --> 14:45.175
-You're like her little husband.
-Ew. Gross.

14:46.010 --> 14:47.553
Well, maybe you're right.

14:48.137 --> 14:51.432
She kind of put all her attention on me
to avoid dealing with my dad.

14:52.016 --> 14:53.517
I gotta hit the bank--

14:53.601 --> 14:55.728
You're not allowed to repeat this,

14:55.811 --> 14:59.273
but things have been
a little rough for old Eliza.

14:59.356 --> 15:02.443
My daughter's friends
call me by my first name,

15:02.526 --> 15:04.653
and that creep at the Gas-n-Guzz

15:04.737 --> 15:08.866
who has sexually harassed me
every time I've been in there has stopped.

15:09.366 --> 15:10.492
All of a sudden.

15:10.576 --> 15:12.578
Feminism is weird.

15:12.661 --> 15:16.290
Plus, LinkedIn is shit.
Haven't gotten any bites on my résumé.

15:16.373 --> 15:19.335
Wait, what? You're looking for jobs?

15:19.418 --> 15:22.463
I mean, I figured
that day would come someday--

15:22.546 --> 15:24.048
Yeah, it's just,

15:24.131 --> 15:26.550
I'm always talking about doing more,

15:26.634 --> 15:29.178
but I've been feeling so stuck.

15:29.261 --> 15:31.472
That's why I'm always
bugging you to do more.

15:31.555 --> 15:33.849
Look at how great things are for you.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.352
I'm just trying to take my own advice.

15:38.187 --> 15:39.480
Are you mad at me?

15:40.689 --> 15:43.067
I truly can never be mad at you.

15:44.735 --> 15:46.654
Thanks, Mitch. Keep the change.

15:46.737 --> 15:48.238
Actually, take the bills.

15:48.322 --> 15:49.698
I will take the change,

15:49.782 --> 15:53.118
because there might be a solar storm,
I could use the copper and silver.

15:53.202 --> 15:54.870
All right, I need to jet.

15:54.954 --> 15:58.999
Gotta hit the bank while it's still open
and I have a few bucks left.

15:59.083 --> 16:03.462
I gotta get back
to the guy I don't wanna see.

16:04.838 --> 16:06.340
Stay in school, kids.

16:06.423 --> 16:08.175
-Okay, Mom!
-You're too late!

16:10.386 --> 16:11.637
You know what?

16:11.720 --> 16:16.100
I just realized that I forgot the
most important part of Special Guy Day.

16:16.183 --> 16:18.852
I thought you had to get to the bank.
Isn't that important?

16:18.936 --> 16:21.730
It is important,
but not as important as this.

16:21.814 --> 16:23.315
That can happen tomorrow.

16:23.816 --> 16:26.944
So right now is Guy's Choice.

16:27.027 --> 16:29.196
You can literally choose anything.

16:29.279 --> 16:32.574
So what, Eliza Walker, do you want to do?

16:33.701 --> 16:37.204
I wanna make sure
Girl Erin knows exactly who I am.

16:37.287 --> 16:38.789
Hmm.

16:39.289 --> 16:40.958
-Oh!
-Ooh!

16:41.041 --> 16:43.335
Why is it so wet down here?

16:44.294 --> 16:45.462
Where is she?

16:45.546 --> 16:47.297
I don't see her.

16:48.173 --> 16:49.758
-What the hell?

16:49.842 --> 16:50.968
Hey, Timmy.

16:51.051 --> 16:53.012
Gerin. Gerin.

16:54.221 --> 16:55.139
Gerin!

16:55.222 --> 16:58.350
-What are you saying?
-Gerin. It's faster than "Girl Erin."

16:58.434 --> 17:00.602
-Hmm.
-She's not here.

17:00.686 --> 17:04.773
I was wondering about your plan.
Wasn't she here like four hours ago?

17:04.857 --> 17:06.525
Well-played, Girl Erin.

17:06.608 --> 17:09.695
You know because of her,
I can't even go to Costco?

17:09.778 --> 17:12.865
It's been six months
since I've had a Toaster Strudel.

17:12.948 --> 17:16.368
-How is that her fault?
-I won't keep Toaster Strudel in my house.

17:16.452 --> 17:17.327
As an adult.

17:17.411 --> 17:21.248
Yes, I used to love those
golden flaky samples when I used to go.

17:21.331 --> 17:22.291
Sorry, sorry.

17:22.374 --> 17:23.584
This is absurd.

17:23.667 --> 17:26.712
Ugh. Oh, God.

17:26.795 --> 17:28.922
I'm just like your mom.

17:30.299 --> 17:32.426
Girl Erin is my you.

17:32.509 --> 17:34.219
Okay, I am pretty drunk,

17:34.303 --> 17:37.306
but I don't remember
sleeping with your husband.

17:37.389 --> 17:41.185
No, I put all my attention into her

17:41.268 --> 17:43.729
instead of dealing with the real problem.

17:44.646 --> 17:45.606
Aaron.

17:45.689 --> 17:48.609
And it's easy to hate her,

17:49.276 --> 17:51.028
but she's just some girl.

17:51.779 --> 17:53.197
He's my husband.

17:53.822 --> 17:57.034
I think I wanted it
to be good so much that...

17:59.578 --> 18:02.247
I never let myself be mad at him.

18:04.291 --> 18:08.253
And I am really, really mad at him.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.675
You know, I can tell.

18:13.759 --> 18:17.137
Your face is what's called,
in some circles, "Ted Kennedy Red."

18:24.812 --> 18:25.729
Come on.

18:25.813 --> 18:27.356
I know what I wanna do.

18:30.275 --> 18:33.737
-Oh, we're crawling.
-Yeah, I'm calling an Uber.

18:33.821 --> 18:35.739
All right, I'll put my box away.

18:38.617 --> 18:42.454
Here's your special drink,
piping-hot mug of Dr. Pepper.

18:42.538 --> 18:45.207
Thanks, for everything.

18:45.290 --> 18:46.208
You got this.

18:47.543 --> 18:49.628
Places. This is the real deal.

18:50.212 --> 18:51.380
Action, popcorn!

18:52.881 --> 18:55.509
<i>You never should've trusted me!</i>
<i>I'm on drugs!</i>

18:55.592 --> 18:59.388
My kitty is a foul-mouthed bear
from Boston! I think I'm ready.

19:01.515 --> 19:04.893
You call that a pass! Hustle! Run!

19:08.480 --> 19:10.065
-It's working!
-Great!

19:11.358 --> 19:13.193
Let's go, Pistons!

19:13.277 --> 19:15.696
Beat those baby ducks!

19:15.779 --> 19:17.322
-No baby anything.
-No babies.

19:20.367 --> 19:21.743
-Oh!

19:24.079 --> 19:24.913
Nice.

19:24.997 --> 19:26.623
Oh! Oh, oh!

19:27.708 --> 19:29.710
This is way more fun than I imagined.

19:31.336 --> 19:35.174
"I know where you'll live."
That is a terrible real estate slogan.

19:35.257 --> 19:39.011
-It's the worst!
-But if he were a horror movie villain,

19:39.094 --> 19:42.890
"Aaron Walker knows where you'll live
and how you'll die."

19:42.973 --> 19:44.099
Bum-bum-bum!

19:45.392 --> 19:46.810
All right. All right.

19:47.811 --> 19:48.854
Between the eyes.

19:48.937 --> 19:51.607
Calling your shot!
I love the confidence, Babe Ruth.

19:53.734 --> 19:55.694
Oh!

19:55.777 --> 19:58.614
-Hell of an arm!
-Thank you, thank you.

19:58.697 --> 20:00.449
Years of dunk tank training.

20:01.617 --> 20:04.828
Do you know that Aaron
doesn't like powdered doughnuts?

20:04.912 --> 20:07.748
What?
Is this like a <i>Men in Black </i>situation

20:07.831 --> 20:10.000
where he's an alien
pretending to be human?

20:10.083 --> 20:13.712
I know, right?
It's not like he's got abs to protect.

20:13.795 --> 20:17.758
Hey, not having abs isn't a crime.
It's a sign you're in middle age.

20:19.218 --> 20:20.052
True that.

20:22.221 --> 20:23.555
Oh, nice!

20:25.933 --> 20:27.684
Why are the results taking so long?

20:27.768 --> 20:29.645
I don't know, but it's making me nervous.

20:29.728 --> 20:32.105
-I'd like to rent this.
<i>-SonoftheMask?</i>

20:32.189 --> 20:34.983
It's my husband's birthday,
which means sex,

20:35.067 --> 20:37.152
and only Jamie Kennedy
can put me in the mood.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.237
Oh.

20:38.320 --> 20:41.698
It's been a while since we've done
the old Jamie Kennedy experiment.

20:41.782 --> 20:44.576
-If you know what I mean.
-I don't, and I'm good with that.

20:46.245 --> 20:48.288
-Take it.
-For free? Are you sure?

20:48.372 --> 20:51.250
-No one but you wants <i>Son of the Mask.</i>
-Here's $5.

20:51.333 --> 20:52.834
-Well, okay.
-Go, go.

20:55.087 --> 20:57.422
-So?
-I passed!

20:57.506 --> 20:59.424
I got into community college.

20:59.508 --> 21:01.426
I-- I'm Elle Woods!

21:01.510 --> 21:04.054
-You got in!
-Yeah, baby! You did it!

21:09.601 --> 21:11.436
Hey, wake up.

21:13.689 --> 21:14.523
Eliza.

21:16.692 --> 21:17.609
Where to next?

21:18.986 --> 21:20.696
Nowhere. My night is done.

21:20.779 --> 21:23.073
Can you make sure
my friend gets home safe?

21:23.156 --> 21:26.910
Oh, come on! Steve said
he'd drive us around as long as we want.

21:26.994 --> 21:29.496
-My name is Victor.
-Victor, right.

21:30.372 --> 21:33.709
Timmy, Victor is begging us to keep going.

21:33.792 --> 21:35.002
I really don't care.

21:35.085 --> 21:37.087
There are more billboards we could hit.

21:37.170 --> 21:38.088
I wish I could.

21:39.965 --> 21:41.425
I really wanna keep hanging out.

21:44.928 --> 21:46.722
I have some work to do.

21:48.557 --> 21:49.683
Of course.

21:49.766 --> 21:51.018
You're a great boss.

22:00.485 --> 22:01.611
Thanks again for today.

22:01.695 --> 22:04.823
I couldn't have gotten through it
without you, Mr. Blockbuster.

22:04.906 --> 22:07.326
Mr. Blockbuster was my father's name.

22:09.328 --> 22:11.121
To McDonald's, Steve!

22:11.204 --> 22:13.540
-Victor.
-Right, yeah, Victor.

22:30.432 --> 22:33.060
-Hey, you.
-Sorry, I'm late. I got caught up.

22:33.143 --> 22:36.646
It's fine. I was scraping shrimp heads
out of a tackle box.

22:36.730 --> 22:37.564
So hot.

22:37.647 --> 22:38.482
I know.

22:40.692 --> 22:43.362
Do you know anything
about a bear in my store?

22:43.862 --> 22:46.073
Um... No.
