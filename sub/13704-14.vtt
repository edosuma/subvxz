WEBVTT

00:50.717 --> 00:53.586
Why did you want to see me here?

01:00.260 --> 01:01.094
It's a present.

01:04.130 --> 01:05.031
Did you write this?

01:15.575 --> 01:16.709
You and me together?

01:17.477 --> 01:18.311
Yes.

01:20.013 --> 01:24.117
I want to hear this song
at the next concert.

01:27.053 --> 01:28.188
It's a duet.

01:29.022 --> 01:30.590
We can sing it together up there.

01:34.294 --> 01:35.128
No.

01:38.131 --> 01:39.699
I'll just watch from here.

01:42.368 --> 01:43.503
This is where I belong,

01:45.705 --> 01:49.309
and that stage is where you belong.

01:52.779 --> 01:53.713
Even though

01:55.348 --> 01:56.983
you turn 30,

01:58.151 --> 01:59.452
or 40,

02:01.187 --> 02:04.390
and even though you end up having
a beer belly and your hair recedes,

02:06.059 --> 02:08.461
I'll always be your fan.

02:26.846 --> 02:28.248
Seeing the Jang U-jae

02:29.449 --> 02:30.984
who is just an ordinary
high school student

02:32.552 --> 02:33.786
made me realize something.

02:36.689 --> 02:38.057
What I like...

02:39.559 --> 02:42.795
is the JB who shines on stage.

02:45.398 --> 02:47.400
Seeing your sparkle disappear

02:48.835 --> 02:49.936
has been too hard.

02:55.575 --> 02:56.442
Hae-seong.

02:57.277 --> 02:58.178
Don't be like this.

03:00.813 --> 03:01.648
Let's...

03:07.120 --> 03:09.889
Let's call it quits now.

03:15.795 --> 03:16.863
I'll go on stage again.

03:19.499 --> 03:21.467
I'll become the JB you remember me as.

03:30.076 --> 03:30.910
It's...

03:32.178 --> 03:35.715
too hard for me to be your girlfriend.

03:38.851 --> 03:39.686
A star...

03:41.688 --> 03:43.289
only looks nice from far off.

03:45.358 --> 03:46.492
Up close,

03:47.627 --> 03:48.561
it's not all that.

04:23.363 --> 04:24.397
We'll get on the bus.

04:24.464 --> 04:26.299
-Sparrows go
-Chirp, chirp

04:26.366 --> 04:28.234
-Duckies go
-Quack, quack

05:29.962 --> 05:33.199
FOR JB &amp; RIAN

05:44.277 --> 05:45.645
EMERGENCY

05:55.088 --> 05:56.689
Oh, no.

05:56.956 --> 05:58.391
I'm sorry.

06:00.893 --> 06:02.628
Please wait outside.

06:12.705 --> 06:19.245
OPERATING ROOM

07:08.027 --> 07:08.861
Please get off.

07:09.462 --> 07:10.997
Hurry up.

07:16.002 --> 07:16.936
Mom.

07:17.937 --> 07:18.838
Mom!

07:21.741 --> 07:22.608
What's all this?

07:24.577 --> 07:25.845
I'm sorry.

07:26.112 --> 07:27.947
I told you to wait just a bit longer.

07:28.915 --> 07:30.116
Couldn't you trust me?

07:31.184 --> 07:32.718
I'm sorry, Ji-gyeong.

07:33.319 --> 07:35.154
I made a mistake.

07:36.355 --> 07:37.824
You didn't do anything wrong.

07:38.891 --> 07:40.293
It's all a big misunderstanding.

07:42.995 --> 07:44.730
Let's go.

07:44.997 --> 07:45.832
Come on.

07:56.008 --> 07:57.510
A comment, please, Rian.

07:57.577 --> 08:00.313
-Just a brief comment.
-Is the rumor true?

08:00.379 --> 08:04.150
-Please give us your comment.
-Please tell us.

08:04.217 --> 08:08.488
-Your comment, please.
-Please give us the details.

08:08.554 --> 08:10.756
JB got into an accident.
Hurry over to the hospital.

08:10.957 --> 08:15.895
-Please comment.
-Give us the details.

08:15.962 --> 08:18.531
-Your comment, please.
-Any comment?

08:31.477 --> 08:32.411
How's JB?

08:33.880 --> 08:34.847
What happened?

08:45.291 --> 08:46.125
You're crying?

08:48.794 --> 08:50.329
How can you be crying right now?

08:55.968 --> 08:57.203
You said you liked him.

08:58.538 --> 09:00.306
You said you cared about him
more than anyone else.

09:00.373 --> 09:01.941
You said you would keep him safe.

09:03.342 --> 09:04.877
How could you let this happen?

09:06.512 --> 09:07.513
How?

09:09.515 --> 09:10.383
Go.

09:11.684 --> 09:13.386
You have no right to be here.

09:15.721 --> 09:16.889
Don't you ever

09:18.424 --> 09:19.926
come near JB again.

09:38.477 --> 09:39.378
Stop it.

09:39.779 --> 09:41.113
It's not Hae-seong's fault.

09:54.794 --> 09:56.729
OPERATION DONE

10:02.602 --> 10:05.972
The EMTs did a good job,
so he's in a stable condition now.

10:08.574 --> 10:11.243
The problem is the damage
to his cruciate ligament.

10:11.811 --> 10:14.914
We have to run a few more tests
for an accurate assessment.

10:15.948 --> 10:17.283
He's okay, right?

10:18.150 --> 10:19.452
He'll recover, right?

10:19.919 --> 10:21.253
We have to see.

10:22.488 --> 10:25.358
If it's severe, there may be
permanent damage.

10:25.558 --> 10:28.728
But that would only keep him
from playing soccer, skiing,

10:28.961 --> 10:32.798
and other such intense sports.

10:37.570 --> 10:38.504
Is the patient...

10:39.605 --> 10:41.540
an athlete?

11:09.468 --> 11:10.403
Dummy.

11:13.039 --> 11:14.206
Look at you.

11:17.209 --> 11:18.544
You shouldn't be lying down like this.

11:29.989 --> 11:31.057
What are those?

11:31.791 --> 11:33.926
A fan dropped them off.

11:34.660 --> 11:36.929
What a strange gift.
A spoon and chopsticks.

12:16.235 --> 12:18.571
The final round of the audition
will proceed as planned.

12:19.205 --> 12:20.539
Please make sure it all goes smoothly.

12:21.073 --> 12:23.309
But JB's accident--

12:26.045 --> 12:28.280
JB was eliminated anyway.

12:28.347 --> 12:29.949
JB is hurt.

12:31.183 --> 12:32.718
Yu-jin and Rian

12:33.052 --> 12:35.988
are also having a hard time
with the intense media scrutiny.

12:37.022 --> 12:40.025
Under the circumstances,
pushing ahead with the audition--

12:40.092 --> 12:42.228
You're not being your usual self.

12:43.295 --> 12:46.632
JB took the stage when his father
was on his deathbed two years ago.

12:48.234 --> 12:49.735
I heard it was you

12:50.402 --> 12:52.438
who taught him that it was a singer's duty

12:53.839 --> 12:56.108
to perform no matter what.

12:57.877 --> 12:59.578
-Back then--
-And you were right.

13:01.046 --> 13:02.848
A singer's performance
is a promise to the audience.

13:04.016 --> 13:06.252
Hoping for JB's fast recovery

13:06.886 --> 13:08.788
and proceeding with the audition
as planned

13:09.321 --> 13:10.623
are two separate matters.

13:17.229 --> 13:20.533
With a doll in my arms that looks like you

13:21.066 --> 13:24.336
I walked

13:26.005 --> 13:30.142
I ended up standing
In front of your window

13:30.209 --> 13:34.580
The light already off

13:36.582 --> 13:43.189
Hating myself for having loved you

13:43.422 --> 13:50.396
My empty heart lets out a laugh

13:52.631 --> 13:56.802
The doll that looks like you

13:57.570 --> 14:01.574
Was precious to me

14:04.510 --> 14:09.615
But I returned home after throwing it out

14:10.216 --> 14:15.287
Along with my love

14:16.055 --> 14:17.256
You're adorable.

14:18.557 --> 14:22.595
Why does the sky hold

14:22.895 --> 14:26.999
So many images of you?

14:27.266 --> 14:32.771
Even with my eyes shut

14:33.505 --> 14:35.407
I still see them

14:36.642 --> 14:40.312
Don't say goodbye

14:42.615 --> 14:44.450
It's a nice day

14:51.657 --> 14:53.425
It's a nice day

14:55.294 --> 14:56.128
All done.

14:59.265 --> 15:00.099
Let's go.

15:02.968 --> 15:05.070
Why are you two together?

15:08.340 --> 15:09.575
What's with the backpacks?

15:11.010 --> 15:12.344
Matching backpacks?

15:13.145 --> 15:15.247
Na-na got it for me.

15:24.323 --> 15:25.424
Hae-seong.

15:27.026 --> 15:27.993
Shin Hae-seong.

15:35.634 --> 15:36.969
Are you still in bed?

15:37.303 --> 15:38.470
The day's half over.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.355
You're so haggard.

15:56.922 --> 15:58.223
You look a million years older.

16:05.230 --> 16:07.566
JB's fine. He woke up.

16:08.667 --> 16:10.936
He'll be good as new
once the cast comes off.

16:17.009 --> 16:18.344
Let's go and see JB.

16:19.278 --> 16:20.479
I'll come with you.

16:24.183 --> 16:25.718
You don't want this or that.

16:26.185 --> 16:29.254
Why don't you just cry
instead of holding it in?

16:31.290 --> 16:32.691
How can I cry?

16:35.394 --> 16:36.895
I have no right to cry.

16:42.234 --> 16:43.268
Just go.

16:44.870 --> 16:45.971
I want to be alone.

17:00.552 --> 17:02.521
You were only pretending to be weak,
weren't you?

17:03.856 --> 17:05.257
You're making this harder for me.

17:05.324 --> 17:06.825
Let me down.

17:06.892 --> 17:08.127
If you promise to be good.

17:09.194 --> 17:10.162
I promise.

17:19.838 --> 17:21.407
Don't you remember what you said to me?

17:23.075 --> 17:26.912
That you would sing for anyone
if you could only sing.

17:31.216 --> 17:33.652
Who do you think really needs
to hear you sing right now?

17:37.256 --> 17:39.191
Why do you think
there's nothing you can do?

17:42.828 --> 17:44.563
Let's take it one step at a time.

17:45.631 --> 17:46.899
We should go to class first.

17:51.403 --> 17:52.905
It's like you're asleep.

17:53.572 --> 17:54.406
Okay.

17:54.640 --> 17:55.541
Get on my back.

17:57.910 --> 17:58.844
No?

18:00.546 --> 18:01.880
Come on.

18:03.882 --> 18:05.951
-It's Rian.
-It's Rian.

18:08.454 --> 18:09.755
How's JB?

18:09.822 --> 18:11.657
There was a rumor that you two broke up.

18:11.723 --> 18:13.225
Your mother was arrested for theft.

18:13.459 --> 18:16.095
Please comment on
the sale of fake designer goods.

18:18.330 --> 18:19.865
I'll tell you everything.

18:20.799 --> 18:22.634
-Please step back.
-Get ready.

18:22.701 --> 18:24.636
She's about to speak.
She needs room to do an interview.

18:27.306 --> 18:28.774
I'm only 19 years old,

18:29.508 --> 18:31.043
but I'm the breadwinner of my family.

18:32.945 --> 18:35.848
Although singing
is something I love to do,

18:36.415 --> 18:37.583
it's also my work.

19:02.608 --> 19:05.210
When you heard my mother was involved
in a fraudulent scheme,

19:06.278 --> 19:07.646
it must have come as a shock.

19:09.047 --> 19:10.382
I was shocked too.

19:11.783 --> 19:13.218
After the TV ban,

19:14.286 --> 19:16.555
my mother struggled financially.

19:17.890 --> 19:19.825
Mr. Lee of my agency
and our lawyer informed me

19:20.993 --> 19:22.995
that my mother was also a victim.

19:23.929 --> 19:25.430
What I'm certain of

19:26.632 --> 19:30.836
-is that some of my fans are also victims.
-Rian really cares a lot about her mother.

19:30.903 --> 19:34.173
-I promise I will compensate them.
-Unlike someone I know

19:34.273 --> 19:36.108
who wants to diss her father on stage.

19:37.376 --> 19:39.811
You little...

19:42.181 --> 19:43.148
You're too aggressive.

19:44.716 --> 19:46.552
JB and I knew each other
since we were trainees.

19:46.985 --> 19:49.488
We always turned to each other
for support like brother and sister.

19:51.823 --> 19:55.894
I apologize for the recent
rumors and scandals.

19:57.829 --> 20:01.366
JB is currently hospitalized
after suffering a traffic accident.

20:02.367 --> 20:03.502
I hope he recovers soon

20:04.403 --> 20:06.071
and returns to the stage.

20:07.639 --> 20:08.473
Thank you.

20:15.881 --> 20:18.283
I saw a whole new side of you.
I had no idea you would be so open.

20:18.550 --> 20:19.918
You got yourself a new fan.

20:21.386 --> 20:22.754
Thank you, Mr. Park.

20:22.821 --> 20:23.655
Is it true

20:24.856 --> 20:28.360
that JB may not be able
to take the stage again?

20:28.660 --> 20:29.761
Do you know anything about it?

20:30.562 --> 20:31.396
Pardon?

20:33.832 --> 20:34.833
I'm sorry.

20:34.900 --> 20:35.734
Rian.

21:38.563 --> 21:39.865
What's wrong, Rian?

21:46.938 --> 21:48.040
What's the matter?

22:03.822 --> 22:05.190
Put them on, you dummy.

22:06.758 --> 22:07.893
Once I get better.

22:10.228 --> 22:12.130
Put those on and get back on your feet.

22:14.599 --> 22:15.667
Put those on

22:18.670 --> 22:21.740
and try running away from me again.

22:40.392 --> 22:41.893
I'm sorry.

22:44.563 --> 22:45.831
I'm sorry I resented you.

22:48.567 --> 22:50.268
It's all my fault.

22:53.939 --> 22:55.941
So please tell me you didn't hurt your leg

22:59.144 --> 23:00.946
and that you can dance again.

23:11.490 --> 23:12.624
I'm fine.

23:15.260 --> 23:16.561
Who said I couldn't dance again?

24:12.517 --> 24:14.019
I haven't seen you cry in a long time.

24:17.489 --> 24:18.690
Don't try to comfort me.

24:20.258 --> 24:21.293
I need to be strong.

24:26.731 --> 24:27.933
Don't laugh.

24:28.467 --> 24:30.001
It's not the time for you to be laughing.

24:31.870 --> 24:33.738
You should be wailing.

24:35.307 --> 24:37.008
I haven't seen you laugh
in a long time either.

24:38.176 --> 24:39.010
What?

24:39.578 --> 24:42.247
So I haven't been crying nor laughing?

24:42.948 --> 24:44.749
Do you know what your face
looked like these days?

24:45.350 --> 24:46.384
Show me.

24:54.392 --> 24:56.394
What? Don't make things up.

24:59.331 --> 25:01.566
If you're jealous, just say so.

25:02.868 --> 25:04.169
You always keep everything in.

25:04.970 --> 25:08.273
I'm not the jealous type.

25:09.875 --> 25:11.276
You're pretty even when you're jealous.

25:12.711 --> 25:13.678
I just want you

25:14.446 --> 25:16.248
to always be your pretty self.

25:17.549 --> 25:18.917
Laugh if you want to.

25:19.451 --> 25:20.752
Cry if you want to.

25:24.322 --> 25:27.893
How about singing yourself a song
for this mission?

25:42.307 --> 25:45.510
"AS THE DAYS PASS BY"

25:59.524 --> 26:01.760
Let's see here.

26:02.961 --> 26:05.830
I'm Lee Ji-gyeong.

26:06.331 --> 26:07.165
Ji-gyeong?

26:10.735 --> 26:12.270
Since you're like the relief pitcher,

26:12.337 --> 26:14.673
coming in at the last minute to save us,
let's get you a nice name.

26:16.174 --> 26:17.008
How about Rian?

26:18.043 --> 26:19.144
What does it mean?

26:19.511 --> 26:22.380
The one who brings good luck to us.

26:23.648 --> 26:24.549
Let's take a picture.

26:27.452 --> 26:28.286
Three!

26:49.341 --> 26:55.280
The only thing I can give you is this song

26:55.947 --> 27:01.886
All I have is this voice

27:06.024 --> 27:06.858
I'll get going.

28:17.162 --> 28:19.397
Stifling and suffocating, dirty cash

28:19.464 --> 28:21.132
Not a penny to my name

28:21.199 --> 28:22.934
As happy as can be

28:23.001 --> 28:24.636
It's a crazy thing to say

28:27.072 --> 28:29.407
Destroying my dream, dirty cash

28:29.474 --> 28:32.744
This world where money
Is the measure of happiness

28:32.811 --> 28:34.913
How much for my dream?

28:36.081 --> 28:37.015
What?

28:37.415 --> 28:39.384
Are you really going to sing this
on stage?

28:40.318 --> 28:43.188
-Your father will pass out from shock.
-Gosh.

28:43.688 --> 28:45.724
Stay out of it
if you're not going to help.

28:46.624 --> 28:47.826
Of course, I'll help.

28:48.359 --> 28:49.394
Good grief.

28:50.595 --> 28:51.429
Here.

28:59.671 --> 29:00.839
I'm going to study abroad.

29:04.042 --> 29:04.876
What?

29:06.778 --> 29:08.513
So don't be nice to me.

29:23.228 --> 29:25.563
Have you decided on a school?

29:26.030 --> 29:26.865
Yes.

29:29.134 --> 29:32.303
I'll call your mom
and have her make the arrangements.

29:35.306 --> 29:37.108
One last question.

29:38.710 --> 29:40.111
Why are you sending me away?

29:42.180 --> 29:43.948
It's for your own good.

29:45.016 --> 29:47.919
Have you ever thought about
what would really be good for me?

29:49.387 --> 29:51.055
I think about it all the time.

29:51.723 --> 29:55.126
I think about what would be best
for you to help realize your dream.

29:55.193 --> 29:56.261
Hasn't it ever occurred to you

29:57.428 --> 29:59.397
that perhaps my dream

30:00.932 --> 30:03.101
is to be at the same school as you
like I am now?

30:13.178 --> 30:14.212
All right.

30:14.813 --> 30:16.114
For the last mission,

30:16.181 --> 30:18.116
from the song selection
to the stage setup,

30:18.183 --> 30:20.485
you'll do it all on your own.

30:20.785 --> 30:25.390
Today, you will report to me
what song you've chosen and for whom,

30:25.456 --> 30:28.626
so that I can get a sense
of where you stand.

30:28.827 --> 30:30.728
Who wants to go first?

30:31.696 --> 30:33.064
Hong-ju.

30:33.798 --> 30:35.567
I'm singing for Na-na.

30:41.039 --> 30:43.341
I'm also singing for Na-na.

30:43.808 --> 30:44.809
What?

30:45.043 --> 30:47.045
Are they fighting over her?

30:49.814 --> 30:50.782
Ms. Ahn.

30:51.583 --> 30:52.917
We'll sing "Dirty Cash."

30:54.986 --> 30:56.020
"Dirty Cash"?

30:56.621 --> 30:57.822
Who's it for?

30:58.990 --> 30:59.991
Her dad.

31:03.761 --> 31:05.763
I'll give the song more thought.

31:06.364 --> 31:08.466
What? You're switching at the last minute?

31:10.001 --> 31:11.369
What about you, Yu-jin?

31:11.636 --> 31:13.137
I'm going to sing my original composition.

31:13.371 --> 31:16.307
No wonder you're a super idol.

31:17.041 --> 31:19.177
-You don't say.
-Who will you sing it for?

31:21.379 --> 31:26.584
World peace, humanity,
or Korean reunification...

31:29.954 --> 31:31.122
I haven't decided yet.

31:31.689 --> 31:33.424
I see.

31:34.058 --> 31:35.894
Who's left?

31:37.528 --> 31:39.330
Oh, right. Hae-seong and Rian.

31:42.533 --> 31:45.670
I'll be singing for JB.

31:48.339 --> 31:49.474
Me too.

31:53.211 --> 31:54.746
Are you two going head-to-head again?

31:58.316 --> 32:00.852
I'm getting tired of this love triangle.

32:02.720 --> 32:04.088
They wear everyone out, don't they?

32:05.657 --> 32:09.627
If only one person would know
their place and give up.

32:11.362 --> 32:12.263
You don't say.

32:22.807 --> 32:25.076
-How about the song?
-An original composition.

32:31.449 --> 32:32.383
My goodness.

33:17.662 --> 33:19.897
I thought I had gotten through to you

33:20.164 --> 33:21.799
since you hadn't shown up at the hospital.

33:22.767 --> 33:23.701
Maybe I was mistaken.

33:28.840 --> 33:30.108
Why are you looking at me like that?

33:31.376 --> 33:32.543
You and I...

33:34.278 --> 33:36.047
I guess it's fate.

33:37.382 --> 33:38.216
What?

33:39.417 --> 33:41.819
You got to sing the first one,

33:43.221 --> 33:44.856
and now, the second one.

33:46.324 --> 33:47.458
What do you mean?

33:48.726 --> 33:49.727
I'll look forward to it.

33:52.697 --> 33:54.332
That's against the rules.

33:54.665 --> 33:57.635
You always change the rules anyway.

33:58.169 --> 34:01.172
I want to change the rules too.

34:03.408 --> 34:06.044
Why do you think
I'll accept your proposal?

34:06.110 --> 34:08.279
What have you got to lose?

34:09.180 --> 34:12.050
The purpose of the audition
is to find the very best,

34:13.151 --> 34:17.722
and you don't think
that I'm fit for the audition anyway.

34:18.189 --> 34:19.690
What will you get out of this?

34:21.225 --> 34:22.960
I'm not doing this to get something.

34:24.195 --> 34:26.531
I just want to give back
what was given to me.

34:38.176 --> 34:39.477
Enjoy.

34:53.724 --> 34:55.960
Welcome. What would you like?

34:56.194 --> 34:57.395
Get whatever you want.

34:58.196 --> 35:00.698
How did you know
I liked this kind of food?

35:01.399 --> 35:03.067
We'll start with noodle soup.

35:03.134 --> 35:05.770
We'll also have spicy noodles
and the set of spicy rice cakes,

35:05.837 --> 35:07.271
sausages, and fritters.

35:08.639 --> 35:10.007
You can eat all that?

35:10.374 --> 35:11.742
You're tiny.

35:12.176 --> 35:13.878
Of course.

35:13.945 --> 35:15.680
I eat way more than people think.

35:16.447 --> 35:18.382
-That'll be all.
-Okay.

35:41.038 --> 35:42.173
This is so good.

36:01.025 --> 36:02.026
It's 20,000 won, right?

36:02.393 --> 36:03.227
-I got it.
-Yes.

36:03.828 --> 36:05.897
I told you I don't like
owing anyone anything.

36:06.130 --> 36:07.532
You saved me,

36:08.366 --> 36:09.400
so this is on me.

36:10.134 --> 36:12.203
Thank you for the tasty meal, ma'am.

36:12.270 --> 36:13.337
We'll come again.

36:13.538 --> 36:14.672
Please do come back.

36:15.206 --> 36:16.440
So long.

36:34.825 --> 36:36.928
Why didn't you say something?

36:38.462 --> 36:39.697
I bet she was worried

36:41.165 --> 36:45.369
that you are still mad at her
or harbored ill feelings.

36:46.837 --> 36:48.773
You should have told her first

36:49.707 --> 36:51.909
that you're not mad at her
and that you missed her.

36:51.976 --> 36:53.277
I didn't miss her at all.

36:53.344 --> 36:54.478
What a lie.

36:55.913 --> 36:58.616
Everyone needs their mother.

36:59.083 --> 37:01.719
No matter how upset you may be at her,
she's still your mother.

37:03.721 --> 37:06.924
Do you think there's anyone
who cares about you as much as she does?

37:09.894 --> 37:11.529
Be good to her,

37:13.030 --> 37:14.332
or you'll regret it later.

37:31.382 --> 37:32.583
Hello, sir.

37:32.650 --> 37:34.852
Hello.

37:35.453 --> 37:38.289
I wanted to see my daughter,
Hae-seong, sing in person.

37:39.357 --> 37:40.458
I'm glad you came.

37:40.524 --> 37:42.293
She practiced very hard,
so she'll do a good job.

37:42.693 --> 37:44.929
This is all thanks to you.

37:44.996 --> 37:48.032
Not at all. I've learned so much from you.

37:49.000 --> 37:50.201
This way.

37:50.968 --> 37:52.003
Thank you.

38:11.422 --> 38:12.323
Shin Hae-seong.

38:14.392 --> 38:15.293
Good luck.

38:16.560 --> 38:17.395
Okay.

38:18.262 --> 38:19.096
You too.

38:32.143 --> 38:33.411
You look suspicious.

38:33.477 --> 38:35.413
Since when have you two been this close?

38:36.247 --> 38:38.215
What are you scheming this time?

38:39.450 --> 38:40.384
Would you like some gum?

38:42.119 --> 38:43.654
Such stinky badmouthing.

38:46.457 --> 38:47.825
Are you a Rian wannabe?

38:52.697 --> 38:53.931
What?

39:21.359 --> 39:22.326
Well, these are for you.

39:27.898 --> 39:31.836
A spoon always goes
with a pair of chopsticks, right?

39:31.902 --> 39:33.037
Like needle and thread.

39:34.372 --> 39:35.206
So...

39:36.173 --> 39:37.742
we should always stay together too.

39:52.156 --> 39:54.058
What took you so long?

39:54.925 --> 39:56.460
Do you know how many times I called you?

40:21.285 --> 40:23.921
I have a favor to ask you.

41:26.450 --> 41:30.488
Today's stage
is your first and last chance

41:31.188 --> 41:33.657
to let your individuality shine.

41:35.459 --> 41:37.027
As you've been informed,

41:37.595 --> 41:39.797
this is the final round
of the Super Idol Audition.

41:41.198 --> 41:45.803
On this stage today,
show us everything that you've got.

41:56.080 --> 41:59.283
The title of today's mission
is "A Song for One Person."

42:00.818 --> 42:03.020
I can't wait to see

42:03.287 --> 42:07.491
what each contestant
chose to sing, for whom,

42:07.992 --> 42:09.393
and how it will be executed.

42:11.161 --> 42:12.863
As this is the final round,

42:13.564 --> 42:16.800
I imagine the contestants
are very nervous.

42:17.735 --> 42:20.337
Please put them at ease
with a warm round of applause.

42:44.094 --> 42:45.296
Today,

42:46.564 --> 42:49.934
I'm singing for the person
I hate the most in the world.

42:50.200 --> 42:51.602
She's crazy.

42:58.509 --> 43:00.144
I've always wondered

43:00.878 --> 43:05.015
why the person I love
always chooses to do things that I hate.

43:07.818 --> 43:09.119
Then it hit me.

43:09.620 --> 43:12.323
I was doing the exact same thing.

43:14.858 --> 43:17.461
I had been doing things
that the person hates the most.

43:19.563 --> 43:23.100
They say people imitate actions
of others they hate, and I realized

43:23.500 --> 43:24.602
I had been doing just that.

43:26.870 --> 43:30.841
The past few months
I spent with him at this school

43:31.775 --> 43:34.478
have been very difficult
and painful for me.

43:36.480 --> 43:39.016
All my friends hate him too.

43:41.685 --> 43:43.120
Is it someone we know?

43:44.021 --> 43:44.888
Who can it be?

43:46.223 --> 43:48.792
But thanks to him,

43:50.027 --> 43:51.895
I got to make great friends,

43:54.632 --> 43:57.568
so I'm going to make an effort
to like him a bit.

44:02.406 --> 44:03.407
Dad.

44:05.709 --> 44:07.911
Are Lee Seul's parents here?

44:08.979 --> 44:10.681
Stop being a workaholic.

44:11.315 --> 44:13.017
Meet up with friends every now and then.

44:15.019 --> 44:16.420
You weren't like this in the past.

44:29.133 --> 44:31.902
In my childhood

44:32.536 --> 44:35.072
That has passed long ago

44:35.839 --> 44:38.175
I dreamt a beautiful dream

44:38.242 --> 44:42.413
About riding a balloon and flying

44:42.479 --> 44:45.182
When I see a yellow balloon

44:45.916 --> 44:48.385
Floating in the sky

44:49.119 --> 44:51.488
My heart is filled

44:51.789 --> 44:55.759
With beautiful memories

44:56.326 --> 44:59.196
My dream as a child

44:59.596 --> 45:02.433
Was to ride a yellow balloon

45:03.400 --> 45:07.538
And fly high into the sky

45:09.606 --> 45:12.643
I have lived

45:12.876 --> 45:15.879
Forgetting about that dream

45:16.613 --> 45:21.285
Because I have grown so much

45:21.952 --> 45:25.756
But when I feel miserable

45:26.390 --> 45:28.525
I want to run around and play like a child

45:28.592 --> 45:34.331
Filling a balloon full of my small dreams

45:35.866 --> 45:38.435
In my childhood

45:39.136 --> 45:41.638
That has passed long ago

45:42.473 --> 45:44.808
I dreamt a beautiful dream

45:44.875 --> 45:49.046
About riding a balloon and flying

45:49.613 --> 45:52.382
Why I can't help but cry

45:52.916 --> 45:55.519
When I look at the sky

45:56.620 --> 46:00.491
I really can't understand

46:02.926 --> 46:05.763
I wonder

46:06.330 --> 46:08.932
Why you forget the childhood

46:10.000 --> 46:13.971
When you become an adult...

46:16.707 --> 46:18.642
Mr. Lee was Lee Seul's father.

46:18.709 --> 46:19.710
Oh, my goodness.

46:21.044 --> 46:23.013
If I had known,
I would've been a lot nicer to her.

46:23.180 --> 46:24.414
GALAXY

46:25.783 --> 46:26.683
"Galaxy."

46:26.917 --> 46:29.086
You're a lucky man, Mr. Lee.

46:29.153 --> 46:31.121
Your daughter's your fan.

46:32.389 --> 46:34.792
This audition is full of surprises.

46:38.762 --> 46:40.364
You can smile.

46:42.533 --> 46:45.068
When I see a yellow balloon

46:45.736 --> 46:48.372
Floating in the sky

46:49.173 --> 46:51.408
My heart is filled...

46:52.142 --> 46:53.343
So, Seul is...

46:55.746 --> 46:56.647
Oh. my.

46:57.481 --> 47:00.317
Though time passes

47:00.717 --> 47:03.821
Though I may forget

47:05.289 --> 47:09.593
Can I still fill the yellow balloon
With my dreams?

47:09.693 --> 47:12.496
In my childhood

47:12.563 --> 47:16.099
That has passed long ago

47:16.166 --> 47:18.135
I dreamt a beautiful dream

47:18.202 --> 47:22.306
About riding a balloon and flying

47:22.372 --> 47:25.876
When I see a yellow balloon

47:25.943 --> 47:29.179
Floating in the sky

47:29.246 --> 47:31.515
My heart is filled

47:31.582 --> 47:35.853
With beautiful memories

48:08.952 --> 48:10.087
Gosh.

48:12.990 --> 48:14.258
Rian's not in the audience either.

48:14.758 --> 48:15.626
What should we do?

48:16.627 --> 48:17.494
Ms. Ahn.

48:20.264 --> 48:22.833
May I go first?

48:26.270 --> 48:27.838
Do you want to do that?

48:29.072 --> 48:29.907
Yes.

48:44.721 --> 48:45.622
I'm sorry.

48:46.189 --> 48:47.858
Mind your manners.

48:47.925 --> 48:49.993
You can't climb over people
in the middle of a show.

48:50.060 --> 48:53.597
You shouldn't stick your legs
out like that.

48:53.964 --> 48:55.599
People need to pass by.

48:59.102 --> 49:00.837
Are you Rian's mother?

49:03.240 --> 49:05.309
Do you know me?

49:05.642 --> 49:06.843
Of course.

49:07.110 --> 49:10.113
Your picture is in the papers
for selling fake designer goods.

49:22.025 --> 49:24.761
It's Hae-seong, Dad!

49:28.165 --> 49:29.933
Sit down.

49:30.534 --> 49:32.069
She has to come in first place.

49:32.302 --> 49:33.437
Go, Hae-seong!

49:38.408 --> 49:40.177
When I felt lonely and things got tough,

49:41.311 --> 49:44.982
there was a friend
who gave me strength and comfort.

49:45.949 --> 49:46.783
Right now,

49:47.417 --> 49:51.221
that friend is feeling lonely
and having a hard time.

49:52.823 --> 49:54.791
Your duet partner isn't here yet?

49:59.396 --> 50:02.299
I think she'll be late.
I'll do it on my own.

50:02.699 --> 50:04.301
-Then you're on standby.
-Okay.

50:05.936 --> 50:06.870
But...

50:08.305 --> 50:13.243
my friend almost lost his dream
because of me.

50:16.613 --> 50:17.447
Now,

50:18.415 --> 50:22.019
it's time for me to help my friend
recover his dream.

50:24.321 --> 50:26.656
I'm going to give up my turn for my friend

50:27.924 --> 50:31.528
who helped me find my dream,

50:31.895 --> 50:33.296
and for another friend

50:34.164 --> 50:37.501
who probably cares more about him

50:39.302 --> 50:41.071
than I do.

50:46.943 --> 50:47.844
What?

50:48.478 --> 50:49.913
She's not going to sing?

51:13.637 --> 51:14.938
Thank you.

51:15.372 --> 51:18.341
We have a special performance
in store for you now.

51:19.109 --> 51:20.977
Top star, JB, is here today

51:21.044 --> 51:25.715
to perform a song himself
to give you hope and strength.

51:25.982 --> 51:27.451
A big round of applause, please.

51:44.000 --> 51:46.570
The song I'm about
to perform is "Together."

51:47.104 --> 51:50.574
It was supposed to be a duet,
but my partner couldn't make it.

51:51.508 --> 51:54.044
I'll do my best to do her part as well.

52:04.254 --> 52:05.088
FOR JB &amp; RIAN

52:11.228 --> 52:13.930
When making it through day to day

52:14.331 --> 52:18.668
And dealing with the daily grind

52:20.170 --> 52:22.839
Becomes difficult

52:23.773 --> 52:26.776
And when among

52:26.843 --> 52:31.748
The many people out there

52:32.682 --> 52:35.685
I feel like just another person

52:36.052 --> 52:42.025
Your loving gaze looking at me

52:42.325 --> 52:48.498
Your loving eyes make me feel special

52:48.565 --> 52:54.571
When you pull me into a warm embrace

52:54.971 --> 53:00.577
All my wounds are healed

53:07.651 --> 53:10.086
Everything becomes okay

53:10.720 --> 53:13.023
The painful memories disappear

53:20.197 --> 53:22.766
I become happy again

53:23.200 --> 53:25.969
A smile spreads on my face

53:26.236 --> 53:31.708
If you can stay by my side

53:32.776 --> 53:38.915
Like you are right now

53:39.149 --> 53:41.718
I can overcome

53:42.252 --> 53:48.525
Any hardship that comes my way

53:58.101 --> 54:00.737
Everything becomes okay

54:01.204 --> 54:03.840
The painful memories disappear

54:10.814 --> 54:13.250
I become happy again

54:13.683 --> 54:16.386
A smile spreads on my face

54:23.393 --> 54:26.029
Everything becomes okay

54:26.396 --> 54:28.898
The painful memories disappear

54:30.667 --> 54:35.905
When I'm with you

54:35.972 --> 54:38.441
I become happy again

54:38.975 --> 54:43.280
A smile spreads on my face

54:54.557 --> 54:57.894
CONCERT FOR PATIENTS

55:29.159 --> 55:30.794
Isn't Hae-seong going to sing?

55:32.095 --> 55:33.963
Hae-seong's a songwriter.

55:41.538 --> 55:42.439
Hang on.

55:43.373 --> 55:44.774
So this means Hae-seong...

55:45.108 --> 55:48.011
She gave up her spot
in the audition for JB.

55:48.478 --> 55:49.546
My goodness.

55:51.514 --> 55:53.683
It's no fun if everything
goes as expected.

55:54.984 --> 55:57.120
Wait, you knew from the start?

55:57.320 --> 55:59.055
It's more fun because I didn't.

56:00.290 --> 56:02.492
What does that mean? Good grief.

56:06.896 --> 56:08.398
What will you get out of this?

56:11.000 --> 56:14.637
I don't make calculations
the same way you do.

56:16.373 --> 56:18.041
I'm not doing this to get something.

56:19.275 --> 56:21.611
I just want to give back
what was given to me.

56:25.281 --> 56:27.417
Are you giving up your spot
in the audition

56:29.119 --> 56:30.754
for JB?

56:32.756 --> 56:33.590
Yes.

56:42.665 --> 56:43.933
Why are you looking at me like that?

56:45.168 --> 56:46.336
You and I...

56:48.104 --> 56:49.773
I guess it's fate.

56:51.141 --> 56:51.975
What?

56:53.176 --> 56:55.578
You got to sing the first one,

56:56.980 --> 56:58.681
and now, the second one.

57:00.183 --> 57:01.251
What do you mean?

57:02.585 --> 57:03.453
I'll look forward to it.

57:25.175 --> 57:27.644
FOR JB &amp; RIAN

57:34.551 --> 57:35.652
I'm asking you a favor.

57:37.253 --> 57:40.690
Please sing this with JB.

57:41.925 --> 57:43.326
But JB was eliminated.

57:44.194 --> 57:45.128
How can he sing this?

57:46.262 --> 57:47.397
I told you

57:48.665 --> 57:51.367
that I would protect JB.

57:54.871 --> 57:57.674
CONCERT FOR PATIENTS

58:00.276 --> 58:01.811
You haven't called me once.

58:02.378 --> 58:03.813
Now you're asking me to do a duet?

58:04.681 --> 58:05.882
Here, of all places?

58:06.950 --> 58:07.784
Yes.

58:20.697 --> 58:21.731
I won't do it for free.

58:23.633 --> 58:25.134
I'm a celebrity.

58:29.272 --> 58:31.207
If I sing this,

58:32.675 --> 58:36.012
treat me to many meals, share with me
the apples your dad sends you,

58:36.579 --> 58:37.881
and do as I say, okay?

58:50.026 --> 58:50.994
Okay.

58:51.794 --> 58:52.762
I'll sing it.

58:54.397 --> 58:56.566
So don't cry.

58:57.467 --> 58:58.301
Stop.

59:36.673 --> 59:37.740
I know all too well,

59:38.908 --> 59:39.842
so...

59:40.877 --> 59:42.812
Why are you laughing?

59:43.980 --> 59:45.882
Hey, have you talked to her?

59:46.449 --> 59:47.784
Like it would make any different.

59:49.619 --> 59:51.054
It should have been "difference."

59:53.356 --> 59:54.991
What is wrong with you?

59:55.592 --> 59:56.426
No.

59:56.793 --> 59:59.329
I'm going to blow up this balloon.

1:00:10.940 --> 1:00:13.476
Stop fighting. This is exasperating.

1:00:17.981 --> 1:00:18.915
Okay.

1:00:29.058 --> 1:00:32.228
What's the matter with you?

1:00:36.699 --> 1:00:38.167
Seriously.

1:00:40.370 --> 1:00:41.871
Don't do it, okay?

1:00:43.673 --> 1:00:44.807
Don't hang up...

1:00:50.313 --> 1:00:51.581
Home.

1:00:53.116 --> 1:00:54.350
Home.

1:00:59.489 --> 1:01:00.790
Did you have fun?

1:01:16.572 --> 1:01:17.674
Oh, dear.

1:01:25.114 --> 1:01:26.449
Why are you laughing?

1:01:29.686 --> 1:01:31.087
Come on!
