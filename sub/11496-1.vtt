00:07.641 --> 00:08.874

00:17.551 --> 00:19.985
Like him,
I graduated high school at 16.

08:57.070 --> 08:59.504
So... (sighs)

08:59.506 --> 09:03.441
My dad stood in this same spot,
staring out at the ocean.

09:03.443 --> 09:05.610
I wonder what was going
through his mind.

09:05.612 --> 09:07.579
I wonder what he was thinking.

09:07.581 --> 09:09.214
Besides, of course,

09:09.216 --> 09:13.084
"how can I nail those two
hot surfer chicks out there?"

09:13.086 --> 09:15.554
Huh, now I'm thinking it.

09:15.556 --> 09:17.556
Oh, please.

09:17.558 --> 09:21.059
With your looks and this house,
I'm sure you do fine.

09:21.061 --> 09:23.028
Well, you'd think that,
but the truth is,

09:23.030 --> 09:25.230
When it comes to women,
I've never really been much

09:25.232 --> 09:26.531
Of a casual sex
kind of guy.

09:26.533 --> 09:28.600
And every time I do
get close to one,

09:28.602 --> 09:29.901
She ends up pulling
away from me,

09:29.903 --> 09:31.736
And then I wind up
back in this room,

09:31.738 --> 09:35.073
Thinking where I
went wrong again.

09:35.075 --> 09:36.741
Alone.

09:38.511 --> 09:40.579
So alone.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.649
(sighs)

09:45.851 --> 09:47.886
Oh, yeah.

09:47.888 --> 09:49.921
(chuckles)
you're not gay.

09:52.692 --> 09:54.626
Mom, I have some news for you.

09:54.628 --> 09:56.661
Sit down.

09:56.663 --> 09:59.097
Okay, push him off and sit up.

09:59.099 --> 10:02.233
Um, I know this is gonna come
as quite the shock,

10:02.235 --> 10:05.770
But it turns out
charlie has a daughter.

10:07.073 --> 10:09.774
Mom? Mom?

10:09.776 --> 10:12.277
Are you dead?

10:12.279 --> 10:13.578
Oh, good.

10:13.580 --> 10:15.747
Um, no, I know.

10:15.749 --> 10:17.415
I know, it's crazy, right?

10:17.417 --> 10:19.117
Yeah, no, she's here now.

10:19.119 --> 10:21.152
Well, well, come on over.

10:21.154 --> 10:23.488
Okay, finish first
and then come over.

10:24.924 --> 10:27.359
Good news.
Uh, my mother's on her way over.

10:27.361 --> 10:29.861
First time I've ever said that.

10:29.863 --> 10:32.130
Wow, insta-family.

10:32.132 --> 10:34.132
Uncle, grandmother,

10:34.134 --> 10:35.667
Step-hot-guy.

10:35.669 --> 10:37.702
I'm sorry,
I don't know what to call you.

10:37.704 --> 10:39.704
Oh, step-hot-guy works.

10:39.706 --> 10:41.940
All that's missing is my dad.

10:41.942 --> 10:44.643
Actually, he's here, too.

10:44.645 --> 10:46.478
Um, follow me.

10:46.480 --> 10:47.946
Uh, where are we going?

10:47.948 --> 10:50.115
Uh, well, you know how sailors
get buried at sea?

10:50.117 --> 10:52.484
Yeah.
I keep charlie
in the liquor cabinet.

10:53.753 --> 10:55.620
Let's see.

10:55.622 --> 11:00.058
Uh, johnnie walker,
jack daniel's...

11:00.060 --> 11:01.726
Charlie harper.

11:02.762 --> 11:06.564
Huh, he looks different
than his pictures.

11:06.566 --> 11:10.568
Um, charlie, this is
your daughter jenny.

11:10.570 --> 11:12.704
Hi, dad!

11:13.873 --> 11:16.174
This seems weird. Does this
seem weird to anybody else?

11:16.176 --> 11:18.410
Yes, it's weird.

11:18.412 --> 11:22.714
Almost as weird as
when we take him to the movies.

11:25.551 --> 11:27.485
Charlie, I wish you were here

11:27.487 --> 11:30.288
To see how beautiful
your daughter turned out.

11:31.691 --> 11:33.091
I-I think you'd be impressed.

11:33.093 --> 11:34.726
I think a lot of...

11:34.728 --> 11:36.695
Oh!

11:36.697 --> 11:38.430
(coughs)

11:38.432 --> 11:40.899
Oh, not again.

11:40.901 --> 11:42.867
I ain't cleaning that up.

11:47.506 --> 11:49.641
♪ <i>men.</i> ♪

11:53.212 --> 11:55.680
Oh. Oh, look.

11:55.682 --> 11:57.248
A quarter.

12:00.052 --> 12:01.586
Unbelievable.

12:01.588 --> 12:03.755
You even mooch
off the dead.

12:05.191 --> 12:06.124
One more.

12:06.126 --> 12:08.126
Yeah, you're
charlie's daughter.

12:08.128 --> 12:10.028
You don't seem very surprised.

12:10.030 --> 12:12.764
Only surprised there aren't
more of you running around.

12:12.766 --> 12:16.735
God, I loved your dad.

12:16.737 --> 12:18.703
I remember the first
time I met him.

12:18.705 --> 12:21.239
He asked me if I knew
how to do three things:

12:21.241 --> 12:23.241
Cook, clean and
score an eight ball

12:23.243 --> 12:24.809
At 2:30 in the morning.

12:26.112 --> 12:29.214
I told him I didn't know
how to cook or clean.

12:29.216 --> 12:30.949
I've been here ever since.

12:30.951 --> 12:32.383
(laughs)

12:32.385 --> 12:34.719
I'm-I'm sure you have
a story about charlie

12:34.721 --> 12:36.154
That doesn't involve drugs.

12:36.156 --> 12:39.224
Okay. One time
at mardi gras...

12:39.226 --> 12:40.892
Or alcohol.

12:40.894 --> 12:42.227
All right.

12:42.229 --> 12:44.129
Once when charlie
was in vegas...

12:44.131 --> 12:46.164
Or hookers.

12:46.166 --> 12:49.267
Geez, you're really
tying my hands!

12:50.302 --> 12:51.336
Okay, I got it.

12:51.338 --> 12:53.404
It was new year's eve,

12:53.406 --> 12:56.241
And charlie was
super not drunk,

12:56.243 --> 12:59.310
And he was with this
crazy not hooker,

12:59.312 --> 13:02.413
And he decided to have
his sphincter bleached.

13:02.415 --> 13:04.282
Whoa! Whoa!
What?

13:04.284 --> 13:05.283
Why?

13:05.285 --> 13:07.719
Because he cared
about women.

13:09.221 --> 13:13.191
Unfortunately, it got
infected, and he needed me

13:13.193 --> 13:16.261
(voice breaks): To dab
a little ointment...

13:16.263 --> 13:18.129
I'm sorry.

13:18.131 --> 13:20.431
It's just that I miss him
so much!

13:20.433 --> 13:23.168
God took the wrong harper!

13:24.136 --> 13:26.137
(door closes)

13:26.139 --> 13:28.773
Evelyn:
Where is my granddaughter?

13:28.775 --> 13:30.642
Did it just get cold in here?

13:32.077 --> 13:34.813
Oh, my god.

13:34.815 --> 13:36.314
Look at you.

13:36.316 --> 13:38.016
Mom, this is jenny.

13:38.018 --> 13:39.050
Jenny,

13:39.052 --> 13:40.552
This is evelyn.

13:40.554 --> 13:42.353
You are so beautiful.

13:42.355 --> 13:44.556
You remind me of me
ten years ago.

13:46.192 --> 13:48.626
Your father was
the apple of my eye.

13:48.628 --> 13:50.228
My greatest gift.

13:50.230 --> 13:51.663
My reason for living.

13:52.665 --> 13:53.598
Uh, hello.

13:54.633 --> 13:56.234
Hello, alan.

13:57.369 --> 14:01.840
I can't believe
I finally have a grandchild.

14:01.842 --> 14:03.641
You already have
a grandchild-- jake.

14:03.643 --> 14:06.744
Oh. Sure. Yeah.

14:07.980 --> 14:10.081
So, jennifer...

14:10.083 --> 14:11.182
Actually, it's jenny.

14:11.184 --> 14:14.385
Darling, you're not 12 anymore.
It's jennifer.

14:14.387 --> 14:16.754
We are going to have
so much fun together:

14:16.756 --> 14:21.392
Lunching, shopping,
taking care of those eyebrows.

14:21.394 --> 14:22.994
Where are you staying
while you're in town?

14:22.996 --> 14:24.596
I'm crashing on
a friend's couch.

14:24.598 --> 14:27.031
Not anymore.
You'll stay with me.

14:27.033 --> 14:29.400
Aw! I love you, evelyn.

14:29.402 --> 14:30.702
Whoa, whoa!
If she's staying anywhere,

14:30.704 --> 14:31.936
She's gonna stay at my place.

14:31.938 --> 14:34.005
And by "your place," do you mean

14:34.007 --> 14:36.608
The office that
you stopped paying rent at

14:36.610 --> 14:39.277
Or the house that
you've never paid rent at?

14:39.279 --> 14:41.346
Look, I'm not gonna let my mom
screw her up

14:41.348 --> 14:42.380
Like she did me and charlie.

14:42.382 --> 14:45.283
Hey! I was a good mother.

14:45.285 --> 14:46.885
No, you know
who was a good mother?

14:46.887 --> 14:48.920
Our housekeeper adela.
She even breast-fed me.

14:48.922 --> 14:51.522
She had just had a baby.

14:51.524 --> 14:53.925
And when the milk truck
is parked on the street,

14:53.927 --> 14:55.593
You don't go
to the grocery store.

14:56.862 --> 15:00.498
Besides, you-you used
to gnaw on me.

15:01.567 --> 15:03.401
You're gnawer.

15:03.403 --> 15:05.036
Nang-nang-nang-nang-
nang-nang-nang.

15:05.038 --> 15:08.039
You know what?
She's gonna stay in jake's room.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.774
Whoa, whoa, no.

15:09.776 --> 15:12.310
I do not want jake's room
to become jenny's room.

15:12.312 --> 15:14.646
You know, in fact,
there is no jake's room

15:14.648 --> 15:15.813
And there's no jenny's room.

15:15.815 --> 15:17.382
There's just walden's room.

15:17.384 --> 15:20.385
And charlie's room.

15:20.387 --> 15:22.320
Why don't we let her decide?

15:22.322 --> 15:23.454
Yeah, yeah,
it's up to her.

15:23.456 --> 15:26.057
Is anyone listening to me?!

15:26.059 --> 15:27.959
Jennifer?

15:27.961 --> 15:29.160
Where'd she go?

15:31.263 --> 15:32.797
Nice job, alan.

15:32.799 --> 15:35.500
You made another woman
disappear.

15:35.502 --> 15:36.901
Can you believe her?

15:36.903 --> 15:39.170
What did I do to her to
make her hate me so much?

15:39.172 --> 15:41.072
Nang-nang-nang-nang-
nang-nang-nang.

15:41.074 --> 15:43.942
Oh, oh. What, you, too?

15:43.944 --> 15:46.411
Oh!

15:46.413 --> 15:48.313
Son of a...

15:48.315 --> 15:50.481
Ooh, a nickel!

15:50.483 --> 15:51.983
♪ <i>men.</i> ♪

15:51.985 --> 15:53.785
This is ridiculous.

15:53.787 --> 15:55.086
We're never going to find her.

15:55.088 --> 15:57.121
I don't understand
why she ran off like that.

15:57.123 --> 15:58.623
I can think of two reasons.

16:01.660 --> 16:05.296
First I lost my charlie,
now I've lost my jennifer.

16:05.298 --> 16:07.131
You still have your alan.

16:07.133 --> 16:09.334
Oh! Don't make it worse.

16:10.936 --> 16:12.337
Nang-nang-nang-nang-
nang-nang-nang.

16:14.273 --> 16:18.209
Oh, god,
my granddaughter's gone forever.

16:18.211 --> 16:21.112
Oh, there she is
at the bus stop.

16:21.114 --> 16:24.716
Oh, god, my granddaughter
rides the bus!

16:29.521 --> 16:31.356
Jenny, what are you doing?

16:31.358 --> 16:34.158
I'm trying to get away
from you people.

16:34.160 --> 16:35.893
Look, I just wanted to see
where my dad lived.

16:35.895 --> 16:37.395
I didn't want
to screw up your family.

16:37.397 --> 16:38.629
Uh, for the record,

16:38.631 --> 16:40.365
They were screwed up
long before you got here.

16:40.367 --> 16:41.666
It's true.

16:41.668 --> 16:43.534
H-hey, if I'm screwed up,
it's your fault.

16:43.536 --> 16:44.569
You raised me.

16:44.571 --> 16:47.138
I didn't raise you,
adela did.

16:47.140 --> 16:50.141
Look, I already have
a messed-up family.

16:50.143 --> 16:51.376
I-I don't need another one.

16:51.378 --> 16:52.410
Oh, we're sorry.

16:52.412 --> 16:54.412
This is just how
we express our love.

16:54.414 --> 16:56.481
Through hate.
Oh, no, no, no.

16:56.483 --> 16:57.915
W-we don't hate each other.

16:57.917 --> 17:02.420
I mean, the truth is,
my mother is an amazing woman.

17:02.422 --> 17:04.422
I mean, she-she raised
two kids on her own,

17:04.424 --> 17:06.557
She's a successful
businesswoman,

17:06.559 --> 17:09.660
She has impeccable taste.

17:09.662 --> 17:10.862
Thank you, alan.

17:12.398 --> 17:13.531
Oh, right.

17:13.533 --> 17:16.501
Uh, and alan is...

17:16.503 --> 17:19.570
The reason I had
my tubes tied.

17:20.639 --> 17:23.941
Because she knew she would
never do better than me.

17:25.511 --> 17:29.180
Please, sweetheart,
I just found you.

17:29.182 --> 17:30.281
I can't lose you now.

17:30.283 --> 17:32.216
We want you to be a
part of our lives.

17:32.218 --> 17:33.384
What do you say?

17:33.386 --> 17:36.454
Well, if I'm gonna be
a part of this family,

17:36.456 --> 17:38.356
I'm gonna need a drink.

17:38.358 --> 17:39.724
You hear that, charlie?

17:39.726 --> 17:41.559
Your daughter
needs a drink.

17:41.561 --> 17:44.262
You're looking the
wrong way, mom.

17:44.264 --> 17:45.830
♪ <i>men.</i> ♪

17:47.232 --> 17:49.133
A toast.
To charlie harper.

17:49.135 --> 17:53.104
My brother, your son,
your father, and your...

17:53.106 --> 17:55.740
Guy who got hit by a train
so I could buy his beach house?

17:57.009 --> 17:57.909
Sorry, evelyn.

17:57.911 --> 17:59.644
It's okay. I got the commission.

17:59.646 --> 18:02.613
To charlie.

18:02.615 --> 18:05.917
So, is that the bathroom

18:05.919 --> 18:07.952
Where the miracle
of my life began?

18:09.421 --> 18:10.455
It is.

18:12.224 --> 18:13.257
Want to see it?

18:13.259 --> 18:14.459
I do.

18:14.461 --> 18:16.327
Text a picture of it to my mom.

18:16.329 --> 18:18.162
Should be good
for some guilt money.

18:18.164 --> 18:20.198
I'll run interference.

18:21.633 --> 18:22.900
All right, everybody out!

18:22.902 --> 18:25.203
Woman visiting the place
of her conception!

18:26.872 --> 18:29.073
I can't tell you
how relieved I am

18:29.075 --> 18:31.109
To finally
have an heir.
Mm.

18:31.111 --> 18:32.176
Wait, what?

18:32.178 --> 18:33.945
She's my granddaughter.

18:33.947 --> 18:35.813
I want to provide
for her.

18:35.815 --> 18:37.415
And since I wasn't around

18:37.417 --> 18:39.617
For the first 25 years
of her life,

18:39.619 --> 18:41.586
It's only fitting that
she inherit my estate.

18:41.588 --> 18:43.988
You weren't around for
the first 45 years of my life.
