01:59.200 --> 02:00.873
Devin, I'm at the back entrance.
I'm going in.

02:08.160 --> 02:09.719
Okay, it's me.

02:11.840 --> 02:13.320
Daddy?

02:13.400 --> 02:16.552
You're okay. Yeah, you're okay.

02:16.640 --> 02:18.552
Okay, we're gonna get
out of this place now.

02:19.560 --> 02:20.676
Come on, baby.

02:22.120 --> 02:23.349
Okay.

02:23.440 --> 02:25.909
Here we go. Hold my hand. Hold my hand.

02:26.040 --> 02:27.156
Yo, Drummer, you copy?

02:27.240 --> 02:28.594
Dev, made contact... Come here.

02:28.680 --> 02:29.670
Back, back, back, back.

02:29.760 --> 02:31.672
All right, you're okay. Come on.

02:35.000 --> 02:36.116
Daddy!

02:38.960 --> 02:40.280
Daddy!

02:40.360 --> 02:41.635
Come on, come on.

02:45.920 --> 02:47.513
We got away.

02:53.440 --> 02:55.397
All right, we're going back in!

03:13.760 --> 03:15.353
...land of opportunity

03:15.440 --> 03:18.558
is offering just that to our enemies.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.959
...the magnitude of destruction
our director of defense,

03:23.040 --> 03:24.076
the United Nations,

03:24.160 --> 03:27.551
and the Centers for Disease
Control warning us about?

04:08.000 --> 04:11.152
I don't know the words to tell you
how I wish I could be where you are...

04:14.560 --> 04:15.994
Protect you...

04:17.519 --> 04:19.000
Hold you...

04:25.680 --> 04:28.832
If there was a way,
I would save you from this war...

04:31.680 --> 04:33.512
which has covered everything...

04:37.280 --> 04:40.034
you, your mom...

04:42.440 --> 04:43.999
our world...

04:46.720 --> 04:49.599
Every morning, I see your face.

04:51.600 --> 04:53.398
I hear your laugh...

04:55.720 --> 04:58.633
your footsteps on the living room floor.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.911
Every night I dream when you were born.

05:14.320 --> 05:16.073
Now I wonder if you're safe.

05:20.240 --> 05:23.392
You can fear for me as much
as I fear for you and your mom.

05:28.320 --> 05:30.391
I won't stop looking, Johnny.

05:34.400 --> 05:35.993
I won't quit.

05:42.040 --> 05:43.520
They taught us that in the Corps.

05:50.280 --> 05:51.509
Never give up.

06:00.120 --> 06:01.474
Ever.

06:28.080 --> 06:29.514
Come in.

06:31.800 --> 06:33.917
Captain, missing debrief?

06:34.000 --> 06:35.150
Corporal Drummer.

06:35.240 --> 06:36.560
Lance Corporal, sir.

06:36.640 --> 06:40.190
Ah. Captain Peyton.
Nice to finally meet you.

06:40.280 --> 06:42.590
It's a pleasure to meet you.
I'm sorry I'm late. I overslept.

06:42.680 --> 06:45.514
It's been a tough couple of weeks.
Please, my chateau.

06:49.480 --> 06:50.755
Can I get you anything?

06:50.840 --> 06:54.436
Just a water, a Coke.

06:54.520 --> 06:58.639
Well, we have a mini fridge
for the court case.

06:58.720 --> 07:00.598
That's a nice perk.

07:00.680 --> 07:02.114
We get a few over here.

07:08.640 --> 07:10.472
It's got cane sugar.

07:10.560 --> 07:13.155
Mexicans do it right, don't they?

07:21.000 --> 07:22.798
That your son?

07:22.920 --> 07:26.072
Godson. Zachary.

07:26.160 --> 07:28.277
You got kids of your own,

07:28.360 --> 07:29.760
- or just the godson?
- Well, right now,

07:29.840 --> 07:33.629
I'm here with you.

07:33.720 --> 07:37.919
So, this will be more informal
than other meetings

07:38.000 --> 07:40.560
you may have had over the incident,

07:40.640 --> 07:42.472
but if you would,

07:42.560 --> 07:45.678
I'd like you to tell me
a little bit about yourself...

07:46.760 --> 07:50.037
your life outside the Corps.

07:51.440 --> 07:53.318
It's not much.

07:56.680 --> 07:59.991
I don't know, you probably got it
all in there, don't you?

08:00.080 --> 08:03.790
Some of it. I'd prefer
to hear it from you.

08:05.480 --> 08:07.472
Married eight years.

08:07.560 --> 08:09.472
One child.

08:09.560 --> 08:12.519
Yep. Jon.

08:12.600 --> 08:14.193
Jonathan.

08:15.880 --> 08:17.997
Jonathan Michael Drummer.

08:21.040 --> 08:23.794
What about Corporal Roberts?

08:23.880 --> 08:26.918
How would you describe
your relationship with him?

08:30.640 --> 08:33.075
Most squared-away Marine I know.

08:37.440 --> 08:39.796
Love him like family.

08:41.799 --> 08:45.680
Trust nobody in the world
with family but him.

08:55.040 --> 08:56.759
Pull one trigger,
regret the rest of your life.

08:58.440 --> 09:00.875
Yeah, fuck it.

09:00.960 --> 09:04.032
- You don't think like that?
- Like what?

09:04.120 --> 09:05.998
Regrets. You ain't got no regrets.

09:06.080 --> 09:07.116
Huh?

09:07.200 --> 09:09.237
You ain't got no regrets.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.433
I have regrets.

09:12.520 --> 09:13.954
Name one.

09:19.600 --> 09:21.239
Well...

09:21.320 --> 09:24.074
I regret bringing you into this bullshit.

09:27.040 --> 09:28.793
He carried me every step of the way.

09:28.920 --> 09:32.436
I mean, I probably wouldn't be here
if it wasn't for Roberts.

09:32.520 --> 09:34.398
And how does that make you feel now?

09:35.560 --> 09:37.040
Not sure.

09:37.120 --> 09:41.672
Well, you must have
some feelings about it.

09:41.760 --> 09:43.956
About how...

09:45.400 --> 09:46.629
I mean, I don't... I don't know.

09:46.720 --> 09:48.837
I'm just trying to get back to my son.

09:50.360 --> 09:54.070
Of course you do. You miss him.

09:58.120 --> 10:02.637
I don't see...
what the point of all this is.

10:02.720 --> 10:06.316
Well, because this is mandatory,

10:06.400 --> 10:10.314
until my local clock strikes seven,

10:10.400 --> 10:12.756
you're expected to remain here, so...

10:14.920 --> 10:18.357
we might as well make the most of it.

10:18.440 --> 10:20.397
Roger.

10:20.480 --> 10:22.676
You got all the power, sir.

10:22.760 --> 10:27.789
But if you'd prefer, we need
not talk about your son.

10:27.880 --> 10:29.997
I'd like that.

10:35.960 --> 10:37.997
You motherfuckers think y'all Marines?

10:38.080 --> 10:39.196
Yes, Sergeant!

10:39.280 --> 10:41.795
I said do you motherfuckers
think y'all are Marines?

10:41.880 --> 10:43.758
Yes, Sergeant!

10:43.840 --> 10:45.752
Good Marines have bled for the Corps.

10:45.840 --> 10:49.277
Good Marines have died for the Corps.

10:49.360 --> 10:52.478
Do you believe you deserve
to die with that same honor?

10:52.560 --> 10:54.119
Yes, Sergeant!

10:54.200 --> 10:57.079
I said do you think you deserve
to die with that honor?

10:57.160 --> 10:58.560
Yes, Sergeant!

10:58.640 --> 11:00.313
Yeah. Y'all look scared!

11:01.480 --> 11:03.358
You might be happy to be a Marine,

11:03.440 --> 11:04.794
but you look scared!

11:05.840 --> 11:09.197
And for that reason
I am inserted into your life.

11:11.200 --> 11:12.190
The papers you're holding

11:12.280 --> 11:14.192
are the serial numbers to your new rifles.

11:14.280 --> 11:15.999
You will memorize these numbers

11:16.080 --> 11:18.800
along with a whole slew
of other information

11:18.880 --> 11:20.633
I deem necessary!

11:20.720 --> 11:26.079
- Is that clear?
- Yes, Sergeant!

11:26.160 --> 11:27.879
You understand you're holding
a piece of paper, Marine?

11:27.960 --> 11:29.110
Yes, Sergeant!

11:29.200 --> 11:30.998
How much does a piece of paper weigh?

11:31.080 --> 11:32.799
How much does a piece of paper weigh?

11:32.920 --> 11:35.594
- Nothing, Sergeant!
- How much?

11:35.680 --> 11:37.558
- Nothing, Sergeant!
- Then why are your arms falling?

11:37.640 --> 11:40.314
Why are your arms falling?
Why are your arms falling?

11:40.400 --> 11:43.040
Why are your arms falling? Tell me why!

11:43.120 --> 11:44.679
Tell me why! Tell me why!

11:44.760 --> 11:46.035
- Tell me why!
- I don't know, Sergeant.

11:46.120 --> 11:47.474
You don't know why your arms are falling?

11:47.600 --> 11:48.716
- No, Sergeant.
- Keep them up!

11:48.800 --> 11:50.280
Keep the piece of fucking paper!

11:52.080 --> 11:54.993
Be prepared to be pushed to new levels.

11:55.080 --> 11:57.879
Be prepared to be pissed off and on

11:57.960 --> 11:59.838
until you become worthy of appearing

11:59.920 --> 12:01.149
when the enemy says...

12:01.280 --> 12:03.795
Again, keep them up!

12:03.880 --> 12:05.030
Pick it up!

12:08.480 --> 12:09.709
Welcome to the pain, rubes!

12:09.800 --> 12:11.075
Welcome to the pain!

12:11.160 --> 12:12.480
- Welcome to the pain!
- Welcome to the pain!

12:12.560 --> 12:14.756
- Welcome to the what?
- Welcome to the pain!

12:14.840 --> 12:16.194
Buddy up and move onto the course.

12:16.280 --> 12:19.034
- Yes, Sergeant.
- Move! Move!

12:19.120 --> 12:21.635
Move! Let's go!

12:21.760 --> 12:24.229
Move it! Let's go!

12:26.400 --> 12:28.392
Forget that fool. We got this.

12:46.360 --> 12:47.919
Move it! Move it!

12:48.000 --> 12:50.117
Let's go, bro! Let's go.

12:50.200 --> 12:51.236
Hurry up!

12:51.320 --> 12:53.835
Group two, hurry the fuck up!

12:53.960 --> 12:55.633
Hurry the fuck up, brother!

12:55.720 --> 12:57.598
Hurry the fuck up!

13:00.280 --> 13:03.432
- Flank! Set!
- Move out!

13:03.520 --> 13:05.432
Close our front!

13:05.520 --> 13:08.638
- Move out!
- I'm up, he sees me, I'm down!

13:08.720 --> 13:10.552
- Stay down!
- Move it!

13:11.680 --> 13:12.830
Shut it off!

13:12.920 --> 13:14.149
What the fuck are you saying, Marine?

13:14.240 --> 13:15.356
Nothing, Sergeant!

13:15.480 --> 13:17.551
- Was I talking to you, Marine?
- No, Sergeant, sir!

13:17.640 --> 13:19.836
Then why the fuck
are you answering for him?

13:19.920 --> 13:21.991
- I don't know, Sergeant.
- You two butt buddies, Marine?

13:22.080 --> 13:23.514
- No, Sergeant.
- Get the fuck up!

13:23.600 --> 13:24.829
Yes, Sergeant.

13:28.360 --> 13:29.680
You got a mouthful of shit, Marine.

13:29.760 --> 13:31.479
Sorry, Sergeant.

13:31.560 --> 13:32.880
We need to go.

13:32.960 --> 13:35.555
- Back to the top!
- Yes, Sergeant.

13:35.640 --> 13:37.916
Let's go! Let's go! Let's go!

13:39.320 --> 13:40.640
I signed up for Greenpeace.

13:40.720 --> 13:43.076
How the fuck did we wind up here?

13:44.320 --> 13:46.152
Fucking dolphins dying, dude.

13:46.240 --> 13:48.550
We could be saving the dolphins, man.

13:48.680 --> 13:51.149
You should tell him that
when we're out there.

13:51.240 --> 13:52.640
That's right.

13:52.720 --> 13:55.235
"Sergeant Miller, I signed
up for Greenpeace, sir."

14:05.600 --> 14:06.716
Stay.

14:12.160 --> 14:14.231
Seriously, you're worse than Johnny.

14:14.320 --> 14:16.437
Stop moving or I will cut you.

14:16.520 --> 14:18.159
- Nat.
- "I'm-a cut you."

14:18.240 --> 14:20.436
- That was good, right?
- That was pretty good.

14:20.520 --> 14:22.989
All right, come on.
I'll stop fucking around. Go.

14:26.240 --> 14:27.469
Ow!

14:30.520 --> 14:32.716
- Ow.
- Okay, stop.

14:32.800 --> 14:35.634
God, you're such a wimp.

14:40.800 --> 14:43.520
- You okay?
- Yeah.

14:43.600 --> 14:46.160
- Hey, are you okay?
- Yeah, I just can't sleep.

14:46.280 --> 14:47.999
I mean, I sleep but then I'm up, you know?

14:48.080 --> 14:50.072
Just back and forth.

14:55.880 --> 14:57.200
I'll take him today.

14:57.280 --> 15:00.398
- You should take him today.
- Mm.

15:00.480 --> 15:01.914
Talk to the teacher.

15:02.000 --> 15:04.196
Kids giving him problems.

15:04.280 --> 15:07.314
Yeah, you need to talk to the teacher,
and then talk to that one mom.

15:07.400 --> 15:09.551
- Which one? Which one?
- I hate that woman.

15:09.640 --> 15:12.235
The fat kid's mom. She...

15:12.320 --> 15:14.391
I almost punched her the other day.

15:14.480 --> 15:16.915
I mean, in my mind I punched her.

15:19.880 --> 15:22.952
- You're a thug.
- Yeah, that's right.

15:23.040 --> 15:24.554
Your wife's a thug.

15:25.960 --> 15:29.078
- I'm serious. Come on.
- I love you.

15:30.240 --> 15:31.640
Yeah? Say it to my face.

15:31.720 --> 15:32.836
I love you.

15:32.920 --> 15:34.639
You better.

15:37.720 --> 15:39.996
You look good. You look like a Marine.

15:40.080 --> 15:41.480
Good.

15:41.560 --> 15:43.711
Get out. You gotta take him.

15:43.800 --> 15:44.790
Yeah.

15:46.680 --> 15:48.478
Let me just get it right here.

15:48.560 --> 15:50.153
Tell that mom!

15:54.120 --> 15:55.349
I see you.

15:55.440 --> 15:56.715
You can't see me from there.

15:56.800 --> 15:58.314
Yeah, I can. I'm looking right at you.

15:58.400 --> 16:00.119
What are you talking about?
I see you right there.

16:00.200 --> 16:02.635
Nope, still see you.

16:02.720 --> 16:04.279
Now I can't see you,

16:04.400 --> 16:06.153
but if I can't see you, you can't see me.

16:06.240 --> 16:07.879
Why is that?

16:07.960 --> 16:10.429
I don't know why is that,
it's just the rules.

16:15.280 --> 16:17.749
What are you learning in school?

16:17.840 --> 16:19.320
You learning fun stuff?

16:19.400 --> 16:21.232
We read, do recess,

16:21.320 --> 16:24.119
listen to music, dance.

16:24.200 --> 16:27.637
Rec... What kind of...? Dancin' around?

16:27.720 --> 16:29.837
That sounds very arty-farty to me, bud.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.229
Speak of the devil...

16:33.720 --> 16:35.313
- Dad!
- Oh, no!

16:35.400 --> 16:36.470
What is that!

16:36.560 --> 16:37.835
You'd better get the window, bud.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.872
- I'm gonna die!
- Oh, no! Oh, no!

16:40.960 --> 16:43.919
Oh, no! Marines, clear out!
Medic, man down!

16:44.000 --> 16:46.993
Uh, oh! Uh, oh! Is he responding?

16:47.080 --> 16:50.915
- Is he responding? He's responding.
- Okay, okay, okay, okay!

16:52.120 --> 16:55.318
- What does that mean?
- Responding?

16:55.400 --> 16:56.629
No, "man down."

16:56.720 --> 16:57.710
Man down is a...

16:57.800 --> 17:01.635
that's a military term.
It's what you say when...

17:01.720 --> 17:04.679
one of your boys goes down
or someone gets hurt, or...

17:06.119 --> 17:07.873
Let me take a wild guess of who that is.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.030
Is that him right there?

17:11.800 --> 17:13.996
All right, I'm gonna come in with you
so they don't mess with you.

17:14.079 --> 17:15.799
- No! Please.
- Why?

17:15.880 --> 17:19.430
- It's just...
- What are you embarrassed of me?

17:19.520 --> 17:21.477
I can walk from here, really.

17:21.599 --> 17:24.273
I know you can walk from here.
You're a grown boy.

17:24.359 --> 17:25.839
How'd this start up?

17:25.920 --> 17:28.388
You just walked in one day
and they started in on you?

17:28.480 --> 17:29.960
- No.
- What happened?

17:30.040 --> 17:33.670
They heard Mom say "I love you"
when she dropped me off.

17:33.760 --> 17:36.559
She said "I love you" in front
of your friends, huh?

17:36.640 --> 17:38.233
Mm-hmm.

17:38.320 --> 17:41.791
All right, I understand. It's no good.

17:41.880 --> 17:44.793
- And you told Mom?
- Yeah.

17:44.880 --> 17:46.109
What'd she say?

17:46.200 --> 17:47.919
She said she was gonna beat the mother up.

17:48.000 --> 17:50.117
She was gonna beat the mothers up?
All right, look.

17:50.200 --> 17:52.556
I'm not Mom, but I damn sure
am gonna tell my kid

17:52.640 --> 17:54.472
I love him when he gets
out the car, all right?

17:54.560 --> 17:55.596
- Yeah.
- So we gotta come up with

17:55.720 --> 17:59.634
some kind of little middle ground,
like a secret word or something.

18:01.600 --> 18:02.795
What about "man down"?

18:02.880 --> 18:06.078
- Man down?
- That's pretty good.

18:06.160 --> 18:08.550
- Huh? Yeah.
- Yeah, I like that. Man down.

18:08.640 --> 18:10.279
I like it, too.

18:10.400 --> 18:12.835
It's got the word "man" in it,
damn sure is manly enough.

18:12.920 --> 18:14.718
You know, we'll just sneak it out
anytime we want to say it.

18:14.800 --> 18:16.917
Nobody will know what we're talking about.

18:17.000 --> 18:20.198
So anytime I want to say I love you,
what am I going to say to you?

18:20.280 --> 18:22.272
- Man down.
- Like that, too,

18:22.360 --> 18:23.510
with that little smirk on your face.

18:23.600 --> 18:24.954
- Say it again.
- Man down.

18:25.080 --> 18:28.039
Yes, good, man.
All right, get out of here.

18:30.320 --> 18:32.073
Have a good day, bud.

18:32.160 --> 18:33.719
You too.

19:07.200 --> 19:10.716
Drummer. Yo, Drummer, you copy?

19:11.840 --> 19:13.433
I got a tudy up ahead

19:13.520 --> 19:16.479
approximately 100 yards southeast
of the main courtyard.

19:39.920 --> 19:40.910
Right there.

19:42.560 --> 19:44.756
What the fuck?

19:44.840 --> 19:46.797
- How long's he been sitting there?
- I don't know.

19:46.880 --> 19:47.950
And yourself?

19:48.080 --> 19:51.517
I'm not sure. Come on, let's go.

19:51.600 --> 19:53.239
What the fuck?

20:01.840 --> 20:05.072
Don't move. Get up. Up. Move.

20:07.040 --> 20:08.474
Down in that corner.

20:08.600 --> 20:11.718
Down. Who are you?

20:11.800 --> 20:13.473
United States Marines. If you
try anything, I take your head off!

20:13.560 --> 20:15.199
- Got that clear?
- Who are you?

20:15.280 --> 20:16.839
Answer the question.

20:16.920 --> 20:18.798
Who are you?

20:18.880 --> 20:21.918
- Charles. My name is Charles.
- Charles?

20:22.000 --> 20:25.232
Hey, Charles. Take a breath. Breathe.

20:25.320 --> 20:27.198
My name's Gabriel.

20:28.600 --> 20:30.637
I'm looking for survivors, you understand?

20:30.720 --> 20:32.040
Okay, man.

20:32.120 --> 20:33.395
What do you know about what happened here?

20:34.600 --> 20:35.636
What happened to...?

20:35.720 --> 20:37.996
To who? The world. Everything.
How come you weren't affected?

20:38.080 --> 20:39.560
How come you weren't affected?

20:39.640 --> 20:41.757
- Oh, please.
- How is it the whole world is in shit

20:41.840 --> 20:42.830
and you're not affected?

20:42.920 --> 20:45.435
Save your compliments for someone
who'd want to hear them.

20:45.520 --> 20:47.716
- This whole world's fucked.
- You're alone?

20:47.800 --> 20:50.031
You got survivors with you?

20:50.120 --> 20:52.794
I got my friends. I got my whole platoon.

20:52.880 --> 20:53.870
Where are they?

20:55.040 --> 20:58.351
- Hey! Stay right there.
- Don't move.

20:58.440 --> 20:59.635
What is it?

21:02.360 --> 21:04.636
You semper fi?

21:04.720 --> 21:08.316
That was a long time ago, buddy.

21:08.400 --> 21:11.711
Whole 'nother world,
but it don't matter none.

21:11.800 --> 21:13.871
They all left us here in hell to rot.

21:15.840 --> 21:17.035
Who did?

21:19.000 --> 21:20.514
You did.

21:22.400 --> 21:23.595
You.

21:25.680 --> 21:28.115
Look, I've been analyzing or pontificating

21:28.200 --> 21:30.840
on variations of this theme for years.

21:30.920 --> 21:32.991
Today I'll state only facts.

21:33.080 --> 21:34.560
There's a mini war in the Middle East.

21:34.640 --> 21:37.155
Iran will most likely have
a nuclear weapon.

21:37.240 --> 21:39.596
Putin basically running unchecked,

21:39.680 --> 21:42.514
obviously a great cause for concern.

21:42.600 --> 21:46.230
Dude, this little guy's gonna
jump out of the fucking box.

21:46.320 --> 21:47.310
Well, put her down.

21:49.760 --> 21:51.672
- Not yet, little buddy.
- Did you see this?

21:51.760 --> 21:55.117
I've got some bowls
for water in the truck.

21:55.200 --> 21:57.351
Oh. Nice present.

21:57.440 --> 21:59.477
...Centers for Disease Control...

21:59.560 --> 22:01.836
- He loves it.
- ...has downgraded the urgency.

22:01.920 --> 22:03.832
While the term
"weapons of mass destruction"

22:03.920 --> 22:05.639
has become a political taboo,

22:05.760 --> 22:10.152
no one can deny that the CDC,
the Centers for Disease Control,

22:10.240 --> 22:13.278
has been the lead story
more frequently than ever.

22:13.360 --> 22:15.431
Okay, I'm bringing
the birthday boy in, all right?

22:15.560 --> 22:17.870
- Yeah. Yeah.
- That comes on again at 11, right?

22:17.960 --> 22:20.191
- All right!
- Come on, pal!

22:20.280 --> 22:22.033
Hey!

22:22.120 --> 22:24.715
Now, what did you want more
than anything in the world, bud?

22:24.800 --> 22:26.439
A year's supply of gummy bears!

22:27.600 --> 22:29.671
- More than gummy bears!
- All right, listen, your dad...

22:29.760 --> 22:30.750
What's that noise?

22:30.840 --> 22:32.797
- That sound like gummy bears?
- No.

22:32.880 --> 22:34.234
What's that noise, bud?

22:34.320 --> 22:36.312
- Your daddy and I talked about all the...
- Hey, what's that sound like?

22:36.400 --> 22:38.995
What's that sound like? A puppy!

22:39.080 --> 22:42.630
Oh, my gosh! A puppy! So cute!

22:42.720 --> 22:45.519
- Don't squeeze him too hard.
- Oh, my gosh, thank you.

22:45.600 --> 22:47.114
What do you think?

22:47.200 --> 22:48.919
- He's amazing!
- Oh, he loves him.

22:49.000 --> 22:50.354
- Wanna show Luke?
- Mm-hm.

22:50.440 --> 22:51.669
Go show Luke the dog.

22:51.760 --> 22:53.991
- Be careful.
- Go show Luke the dog.

22:54.080 --> 22:56.356
Everyone, look! It's a puppy!

22:58.000 --> 22:59.912
- He loves it.
- Yeah.

23:01.480 --> 23:02.630
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

23:02.720 --> 23:04.598
I wouldn't have done that without you.

23:04.680 --> 23:07.957
Yeah. Be careful!

23:11.240 --> 23:14.278
- Oh, don't tell me I missed that.
- You missed that.

23:14.360 --> 23:17.637
What? He lose his shit?

23:17.720 --> 23:20.599
Lost it. I'm gonna party with him.

23:20.680 --> 23:22.273
There he is.

23:24.480 --> 23:26.278
Okay. You gonna shoot me?

23:28.160 --> 23:29.640
What are you gonna name the dog?

23:29.760 --> 23:31.433
I was thinking Ichabod.

23:31.520 --> 23:36.436
What do you know about dog hats?
What do you know about dog hats?

23:36.560 --> 23:38.119
You want dog hats?

23:39.720 --> 23:42.758
- You've never had a dog hat?
- Nope!

23:42.840 --> 23:44.832
Hey, Luke, what do
you know about dog hats?

23:44.920 --> 23:46.832
He'll be all right.

23:50.320 --> 23:51.549
Close your eyes.

23:52.360 --> 23:54.352
Do not rub your eyes
once I apply the application.

23:54.440 --> 23:56.716
- Roger, Sergeant.
- Take a deep breath.

23:56.800 --> 24:01.079
Turn around when you're ready. OC, OC.

24:01.160 --> 24:03.072
Open your eyes. How many
fingers am I holding up?

24:03.160 --> 24:05.152
- Open them.
- Two, Sergeant.

24:05.240 --> 24:06.720
- Move, go!
- That's right, let's go! Let's go!

24:06.840 --> 24:08.274
Let's go, move!

24:08.360 --> 24:10.477
Get mad, Marine, get mad!

24:10.560 --> 24:12.870
Get back, get back, get back, get back!

24:12.960 --> 24:15.031
This is our push! Spread out!

24:15.120 --> 24:17.555
Move! Move! Let's go!

24:17.640 --> 24:19.279
Speed up! Speed up!

24:19.360 --> 24:22.194
Let's go! Let's go!
Keep moving! Keep moving!

24:22.280 --> 24:25.751
Get back, get back, get back,
get back, get back, get back!

24:25.840 --> 24:27.752
Let's go! Let's go!

24:27.840 --> 24:29.559
What the fuck are you doing, Marine?

24:29.640 --> 24:31.120
Why the fuck are you rubbing your eyes?

24:31.240 --> 24:32.913
- I can't see, Sarge.
- Of course you can't see.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.639
Your fucking eyes are closed.

24:34.720 --> 24:37.679
What do you believe
the simple solution to that would be?

24:37.760 --> 24:38.876
Open my eyes, Sarge.

24:38.960 --> 24:40.758
Well, there you go! Figure this shit out.

24:40.840 --> 24:42.877
And look how fucking easy that was!

24:43.000 --> 24:45.754
Keep your head up and eyes on
the fucking target!

24:45.880 --> 24:48.634
- Look at this shit, man.
- Keep moving.

24:48.720 --> 24:51.519
Huh? Fucking beautiful!

24:51.600 --> 24:53.831
You ask, "Why the pain?

24:53.920 --> 24:56.480
Why the deprivation?"

24:56.560 --> 24:58.870
Eh, fuck, man.

25:00.320 --> 25:01.720
All right, come on.

25:01.800 --> 25:03.996
Pain doesn't subside as your enemy listens

25:04.080 --> 25:05.560
for sounds to fire towards.

25:05.640 --> 25:07.677
Move, motherfucker, move!

25:07.760 --> 25:09.752
Keep moving! Keep moving!

25:09.840 --> 25:11.752
Hand over your rifle.

25:11.840 --> 25:14.594
Roberts, help out your fellow Marine.

25:14.680 --> 25:15.955
Looks like he could use some water.

25:16.960 --> 25:18.280
Next!

25:19.280 --> 25:21.237
Open your eyes. Open your eyes.

25:21.320 --> 25:24.438
Come on, brother, push it out. Come on.

25:24.520 --> 25:26.637
Push it out. Come on, brother.

25:26.720 --> 25:29.713
Well, somebody gotta applaud
the Jamaican bobsled team.

25:29.840 --> 25:31.274
Am I right, Marines?

25:31.360 --> 25:32.430
Yes, Sergeant!

25:32.520 --> 25:35.513
- Am I right, Marines?
- Yes, sir!

25:37.960 --> 25:39.076
The fuck.

25:39.160 --> 25:40.799
That burns like a motherfucker.

25:40.880 --> 25:41.950
Like a motherfucker.

25:42.040 --> 25:43.599
Like a motherfucker, man.

25:43.680 --> 25:46.275
Hit that fan. All right.

25:47.840 --> 25:50.435
You'll be all right, brother.
I love you, man.

25:58.160 --> 26:02.074
- Yo, Sergeant Miller, how about a speech?
- Come on

26:02.160 --> 26:04.117
They don't pay me
for speeches, little spoon.

26:04.200 --> 26:07.079
- Hey, it's big spoon, man.
- Ain't what I heard.

26:08.280 --> 26:09.873
Peek at you, snuggling.

26:09.960 --> 26:11.110
Sir.

26:13.280 --> 26:17.593
All right. In a few short days,

26:17.720 --> 26:21.873
you guys will be assigned units,
and there you'll go where duty calls.

26:21.960 --> 26:23.633
It's that simple.

26:23.720 --> 26:26.235
So with not much left to say,

26:26.320 --> 26:27.879
I will leave you with the words

26:27.960 --> 26:31.920
of the late, great, Eleanor Roosevelt,

26:32.000 --> 26:34.720
who so eloquently stated,

26:34.800 --> 26:36.951
"The Marines I've seen around this world

26:37.040 --> 26:38.997
"have the cleanest bodies,

26:39.080 --> 26:43.916
"filthiest minds, highest morale...

26:44.000 --> 26:45.275
"and lowest morals

26:45.360 --> 26:47.670
of any group of animals I've ever seen."

26:47.760 --> 26:49.672
Why are you looking at me, man?

26:51.240 --> 26:53.391
Thank God for the United States
Marine Corps!

26:53.480 --> 26:56.439
- Hoorah! Yeah!
- Let's give him one!

26:56.520 --> 26:59.115
Eat up. I'm-a eat.

26:59.200 --> 27:01.760
- What you want?
- Give me a hotdog, big spoon.

27:01.840 --> 27:02.956
All right.

27:03.040 --> 27:04.440
Hey, bring me one.

27:12.200 --> 27:14.237
- Great speech.
- Oh yeah.

27:14.360 --> 27:15.430
Yeah.

27:15.520 --> 27:17.796
Nothing like an Eleanor Roosevelt quote

27:17.880 --> 27:19.792
to get the crowd going.

27:19.880 --> 27:22.031
- "Elyeanor."
- It's Eleanor, baby.

27:22.160 --> 27:24.675
I'm just saying it 'cause he said it.

27:24.760 --> 27:28.356
- Good throw, Jon!
- Hey, nice spiral, baby!

27:28.440 --> 27:30.750
- Kid's got an arm, man!
- Yeah, he does.

27:30.840 --> 27:32.877
Yo, peewee league, man,
that's all I'm saying.

27:32.960 --> 27:34.474
That's a good idea, actually.

27:36.080 --> 27:38.959
- Peewee league. Yeah.
- You think?

27:39.040 --> 27:40.520
I guess it would be good for him

27:40.600 --> 27:43.877
to be around other dads
and stuff while you're away.

27:43.960 --> 27:48.193
- Yeah!
- Yeah.

27:51.880 --> 27:52.916
So, yeah.

27:53.000 --> 27:54.400
Yeah, if it makes him happy, yeah.

27:54.480 --> 27:56.472
It'll make him happy. Jon! Hey, Jon!

27:56.560 --> 27:59.359
What do you think about peewee league?

27:59.440 --> 28:00.920
Yeah! Yeah!

28:01.000 --> 28:02.912
- Peewee league?
- Yeah.

28:04.520 --> 28:06.477
- Sold.
- Sold.

28:06.560 --> 28:08.552
Throw me one, Jon.

28:15.080 --> 28:18.471
- Corporal Devin Roberts.
- Mm-hmm.

28:19.880 --> 28:23.794
I'd like to understand the relationship
between you both.

28:23.880 --> 28:27.157
There's not much to understand.
We grew up on the same block.

28:30.360 --> 28:32.875
His parents kicked him out,
my parents took him in,

28:32.960 --> 28:36.795
and right around the time we ran into
things in common, we shipped off.

28:38.800 --> 28:40.200
To war.

28:42.880 --> 28:44.678
To war.

28:45.920 --> 28:47.195
He's my battle buddy.

28:47.280 --> 28:50.114
We kicked in doors together,
we took enemy fire...

28:52.200 --> 28:55.318
It's just not a relationship
you'd understand

28:55.400 --> 28:57.960
if you haven't been through it, I guess.

28:58.040 --> 29:01.192
Well, I've seen it discussed a lot,

29:01.280 --> 29:04.318
so why don't you try me?

29:08.000 --> 29:12.631
- "Discussed a lot."
- Something funny about that?

29:15.600 --> 29:17.671
Just it's different.

29:21.120 --> 29:22.918
Boots on the ground.

29:24.960 --> 29:25.996
Yeah?

29:26.080 --> 29:27.912
Yeah, it's not that,

29:28.000 --> 29:30.595
it's just something you don't discuss.

29:34.000 --> 29:36.151
What you saw.

29:41.880 --> 29:43.439
My name's Gabriel Drummer.

29:43.520 --> 29:45.079
I'm looking for my family.

29:45.160 --> 29:46.480
Oh, well, fucking A.

29:46.560 --> 29:48.870
Look at me. I'm going to show you, okay?

29:48.960 --> 29:51.236
I need you to look at the photo.

29:51.320 --> 29:53.312
Show you this photo, Charles.

29:53.400 --> 29:55.232
This is my wife and son.

29:55.320 --> 29:56.913
Gabriel the archangel.

29:57.000 --> 29:59.640
- Can you look at the photo?
- There you go.

29:59.720 --> 30:01.632
I don't know anything, man.

30:01.720 --> 30:03.916
- Look at the photo, Charles.
- I don't know anything.

30:04.000 --> 30:07.710
Look at it! Do you recognize the faces?

30:07.800 --> 30:10.269
- Ain't nobody here, man.
- Have you seen these people?

30:10.360 --> 30:12.556
- Ain't nobody here, man.
- Yeah, but you.

30:12.640 --> 30:15.792
But you. You're here.

30:15.880 --> 30:18.270
- And now you.
- Hey!

30:18.360 --> 30:19.919
You think I won't kill you?

30:20.000 --> 30:22.196
You think I won't kill you, Charles?

30:22.280 --> 30:24.636
- No.
- No?

30:24.760 --> 30:26.160
I mean, yeah, I'm...

30:26.240 --> 30:29.312
You think I won't kill you? Hmm?

30:29.400 --> 30:31.073
- No.
- Look at me.

30:31.160 --> 30:34.232
Yes. I mean, yes, I will.

30:34.320 --> 30:38.872
Yo, fuck this fool, man.
Let's just take his shit and go.

30:38.960 --> 30:41.759
You need sleep, Charles.
You got shelter around here?

30:44.040 --> 30:46.760
- Charles.
- Answer the question.

30:48.040 --> 30:49.474
Where's home?

30:53.840 --> 30:54.830
Over there.

30:59.800 --> 31:01.519
Get your shit, Charles.

31:12.640 --> 31:14.791
Hey, you almost done, little man?

31:16.880 --> 31:18.599
I'm gonna go outside.

31:22.440 --> 31:24.796
Hey, so I was talking to some of the aides

31:24.880 --> 31:28.396
over at Johnny's school
about the little football program.

31:28.480 --> 31:29.550
Peewee league?

31:29.640 --> 31:31.597
Yeah, they said they're
gonna have it at night

31:31.680 --> 31:34.240
with some other activities
when I'm at work.

31:34.320 --> 31:36.516
That's perfect.

31:36.600 --> 31:40.116
They're already putting together
all these care packages for you,

31:40.200 --> 31:42.032
all kinds of sweet things.

31:42.120 --> 31:43.440
I mean, I'm easy, you know.

31:43.520 --> 31:45.910
Just peanut butter anything, and I'm good.

31:46.000 --> 31:47.070
Right, Jon?

31:49.200 --> 31:50.998
- You all right, pal?
- Yeah.

31:51.080 --> 31:52.753
- Gabe.
- Hey.

31:52.840 --> 31:54.957
Gabe, can I please just
have a minute with you?

31:55.040 --> 31:56.235
Yeah.

32:05.520 --> 32:08.070
What, so you're just going
to pretend like this isn't happening?

32:10.120 --> 32:12.635
I mean, I don't know
what you want me to say, Nat.

32:15.400 --> 32:20.429
- I can't be a single mom, Gabe.
- You're not a single mom.

32:21.800 --> 32:25.476
You know, there's a war going on,
I'm not making it up.

32:25.560 --> 32:27.631
It's something we were
both aware of when we signed up.

32:27.720 --> 32:30.440
- When you signed up.
- Okay, Natty.

32:30.520 --> 32:32.557
And what. What does Devin get to do?

32:32.640 --> 32:35.030
Why does he get to stay back,
'cause he broke his arm?

32:35.120 --> 32:36.918
I mean, he gets to stay back for what?

32:37.000 --> 32:38.639
Because we need a presence here as well.

32:38.720 --> 32:41.360
Why? Who the fuck's attacking America?

32:41.480 --> 32:43.517
You're gonna be okay, Nat.

32:43.600 --> 32:44.954
Really?

32:46.720 --> 32:48.074
Afghanistan, Gabe?

32:48.160 --> 32:50.152
You think that I... that I
want to do this,

32:50.280 --> 32:53.194
that this is something I want to do,
like I can't wait to go to war?

32:53.280 --> 32:55.920
You know, I'd love to stay here
and just be here with you, Natty,

32:56.000 --> 32:58.196
but I can't do that.
That's not an option for me.

32:58.280 --> 32:59.509
Man...

33:03.240 --> 33:04.594
I'm sorry.

33:08.320 --> 33:10.152
You know, it's not easy for me, either.

33:10.240 --> 33:11.435
You're mad and he's mad and...

33:11.520 --> 33:13.591
No, I'm sad, and he's fucking sad,

33:13.720 --> 33:15.677
and the whole neighborhood's sad.

33:15.760 --> 33:20.198
Stop. Hey, come on. Stop, Nat.

33:21.560 --> 33:23.472
Natty, I'm sorry.

33:26.680 --> 33:27.670
Come on.

33:29.160 --> 33:30.833
We're gonna be fine.

33:32.320 --> 33:34.755
Hey, we're gonna be fine. Come on.

33:36.480 --> 33:38.631
Don't look at me.

33:48.080 --> 33:50.276
We're gonna be fine.

33:52.280 --> 33:54.192
- I love you.
- I love you.

34:03.720 --> 34:05.040
Hey, bud.

34:10.280 --> 34:13.398
- You're leaving.
- Yeah.

34:23.360 --> 34:26.398
You won't play anymore? Why?

34:33.520 --> 34:35.591
You know, I was thinking about...

34:35.679 --> 34:37.956
I was thinking about...

34:38.040 --> 34:42.239
You know, in the old days,
we used to send letters.

34:42.320 --> 34:44.152
I mean, way back, you know.

34:44.239 --> 34:46.550
It was, like, a big process.

34:46.639 --> 34:49.599
You had to, like, write it by hand.

34:49.679 --> 34:53.469
You had a find a stamp, find a mailbox.

34:53.560 --> 34:55.313
It was just this whole big thing.

34:55.400 --> 34:57.835
Now, we don't have to do that anymore,

34:57.920 --> 35:00.640
'cause now we got email and Skype...

35:00.720 --> 35:04.191
It's almost like
I'm here already, you know?

35:04.280 --> 35:06.397
And before you know it, I will be.

35:08.320 --> 35:09.515
You know?

35:14.720 --> 35:16.677
I could give you something.

35:16.800 --> 35:18.029
Yeah.

35:21.040 --> 35:22.474
What is it?

35:22.560 --> 35:24.631
It's me and Mom.

35:24.720 --> 35:27.554
Oh!

35:28.680 --> 35:30.956
Mom know you have this?

35:32.560 --> 35:34.552
You sneaky little weasel.

35:41.360 --> 35:43.397
I love you, man.

35:45.400 --> 35:47.312
I love you so much.

35:51.400 --> 35:52.993
And when you get there,

35:53.080 --> 35:56.152
will you do that letter thing with me?

35:56.240 --> 35:57.640
Yeah, I'll do the letter thing
as soon as I get there.

35:57.720 --> 36:00.599
Soon as I land,
I'll start with the letter thing.

36:00.720 --> 36:02.951
In hand, every day. All right?

36:19.760 --> 36:21.672
Look at me. Man down.

36:23.080 --> 36:24.594
Man down.

36:38.400 --> 36:39.629
All right.

36:45.680 --> 36:47.672
Last stop.

36:47.760 --> 36:49.433
You know, it was you that got me
into this shit.

36:50.960 --> 36:53.759
Yeah, well, seemed like
a good idea at the time.

36:58.520 --> 37:03.151
Hey, man, you could always
put your arm through a fucking window.

37:04.920 --> 37:06.036
Yeah.

37:06.160 --> 37:07.753
I can't believe this shit.

37:16.880 --> 37:19.554
You're the only family I ever had, man.

37:21.000 --> 37:22.559
All right, don't do that shit now.

37:23.880 --> 37:25.917
Just watch out for mine, all right?

37:27.520 --> 37:29.637
- You know I will.
- I know you will.

37:34.200 --> 37:36.431
All right, send me pictures and...

37:37.720 --> 37:39.518
I know what kind of pictures you want.

37:39.600 --> 37:41.193
Yeah, all right.

37:42.800 --> 37:44.280
Don't be a bitch out there!

37:44.360 --> 37:45.953
You know me.

38:17.320 --> 38:20.392
I don't know where he is...

38:22.520 --> 38:24.000
I don't know where Johnny is.

38:24.080 --> 38:25.400
What'd you say?

38:27.960 --> 38:30.270
Hey, what did you just say?

38:31.800 --> 38:34.520
- What'd you say?
- Nothing. I didn't...

38:34.600 --> 38:36.478
No, you just said "Johnny," man.

38:40.240 --> 38:42.152
You recognize the boy in the photo?

38:43.520 --> 38:45.318
- What?
- My son?

38:47.520 --> 38:51.070
- I don't recognize anyone.
- That's bullshit.

38:51.160 --> 38:53.800
That's bullshit, man. He's lying to you.

38:53.880 --> 38:55.792
He just said Johnny's name.

38:55.880 --> 38:58.440
On my life, he just said
your son's name, man.

39:02.400 --> 39:03.754
He said it.

39:07.360 --> 39:09.431
Let's just get where we're going.

39:40.800 --> 39:44.032
- Hello?
- Devin.

39:44.120 --> 39:46.032
Yo.

39:46.120 --> 39:47.713
- Hey.
- What the fuck...

39:47.800 --> 39:50.520
Hey, sorry I'm calling late, man.

39:50.600 --> 39:52.637
You doing something right now?

39:52.720 --> 39:55.030
- No.
- Can you talk?

39:55.160 --> 39:56.276
- Yeah, man.
- I was trying...

39:56.360 --> 39:58.272
I was trying to get ahold of Natalie,

39:58.360 --> 40:01.478
but I can't get her
on cell or Skype, so...

40:01.560 --> 40:02.789
Yeah, yeah, no, of course, man.

40:02.920 --> 40:07.597
Um... yeah, I think, you know,
I think she's been pretty hectic

40:07.680 --> 40:09.592
with Johnny's, you know, practice,

40:09.680 --> 40:11.717
and working late and whatever, so...

40:11.800 --> 40:16.192
But I can go 'round and check
it out or whatever if you're worried.

40:16.280 --> 40:18.920
- Yeah, can you do that?
- Yeah, man, of course.

40:19.000 --> 40:22.118
- How's Johnny?
- Johnny's great, man.

40:22.200 --> 40:24.476
He's good, yeah. He's killing it.

40:24.560 --> 40:26.631
- Really!
- Man, he's murdering, bro.

40:26.720 --> 40:28.632
Romo's got nothing on that kid, man.

40:28.720 --> 40:30.279
No!

40:30.360 --> 40:31.919
Not that Romo's got anything on anybody,

40:32.000 --> 40:34.037
- you know how it is.
- Yeah.

40:34.160 --> 40:37.597
So, it's pretty fucked up over there, huh?

40:39.440 --> 40:41.830
Yeah, it's pretty fucked up.

40:41.960 --> 40:43.713
But listen, good news.

40:43.800 --> 40:47.271
I'm headed your way,
like, a week from tomorrow.

40:47.360 --> 40:48.430
Get outta here.

40:48.520 --> 40:51.513
- Yeah, for real.
- Wow.

40:51.600 --> 40:54.160
Yeah, I got this thing
off my arm, bro. I'm coming.

40:54.240 --> 40:55.310
That's great.

40:55.400 --> 40:56.516
Yeah.

40:56.640 --> 40:58.313
Anyway, you know,

40:58.400 --> 41:01.040
I just want to thank you
for going to check on things.

41:01.120 --> 41:02.315
Oh, come on, man, of course.

41:02.400 --> 41:03.470
- Yeah.
- Of course.

41:03.560 --> 41:04.960
If you see Natty, tell her I love her.

41:05.040 --> 41:06.110
I will.

41:06.200 --> 41:08.476
Tell her to pick up her cell phone.

41:08.560 --> 41:10.870
- Yeah, okay, man.
- All right.

41:20.320 --> 41:22.073
Your address...

41:22.160 --> 41:26.200
2273 Minnesota Street, is that correct?

41:26.280 --> 41:27.634
Yes, sir.

41:27.720 --> 41:30.280
And that's where your wife
and child reside?

41:31.680 --> 41:32.875
Yes, sir.

41:36.320 --> 41:39.870
I don't really see what that
has to do with anything, sir.

41:39.960 --> 41:42.395
Why you keep looking at that paper.

41:45.000 --> 41:47.117
Would you rather I not?

41:47.200 --> 41:48.600
I don't know.

41:48.680 --> 41:51.718
Is there a reason you
asked about my address?

41:52.920 --> 41:54.673
Just making sure you're you.

41:55.800 --> 41:56.950
Okay.

41:58.600 --> 42:00.273
Am I me?

42:01.480 --> 42:02.800
I believe so.

42:10.640 --> 42:12.359
Why don't we talk about Kamdesh?

42:12.440 --> 42:13.954
I mean, that's the reason
I'm here, isn't it?

42:17.320 --> 42:18.310
Okay.

42:20.720 --> 42:22.120
Kamdesh.

42:40.080 --> 42:41.480
Can they give the shit vehicles

42:41.560 --> 42:43.472
to the Army next time? This is bullshit.

42:43.560 --> 42:46.394
- Machines break down, Marine.
- Yes, they do.

42:50.160 --> 42:52.755
We're all good up here.
This area is secure.

42:52.880 --> 42:55.315
We're at war, Marine. Nothing's secure.

42:55.400 --> 42:56.390
Yes, sir.

42:58.840 --> 43:02.311
Candygram. Trick or treat.

43:02.400 --> 43:04.357
They want a fucking hand delivery.

43:04.440 --> 43:06.511
Yeah, that's why I don't bother.

43:06.600 --> 43:07.590
How's the arm, Roberts?

43:07.680 --> 43:09.353
- It's great.
- Yeah?

43:09.480 --> 43:11.153
- Yeah. Uh-huh.
- You've been whacking it?

43:11.240 --> 43:12.674
How about Drummer?
You been whacking Drummer?

43:12.760 --> 43:14.399
- Yep.
- How we doing down there, Jones?

43:14.480 --> 43:16.199
Two minutes should be good
to pull her out, sir.

43:18.320 --> 43:20.073
Let's keep our heads on, Marines!

43:20.200 --> 43:23.477
Come on, it's candy! Everybody likes it.

43:23.560 --> 43:26.473
They don't like the candy.
I can't get anything out of these kids.

43:26.560 --> 43:27.914
You see him on the second deck?

43:28.040 --> 43:29.474
They say gluten-free.

43:29.560 --> 43:32.519
- Shut the fuck up.
- Just about good here, sir.

43:32.600 --> 43:36.230
These kids must be on
the fucking Atkins Diet, or some shit.

43:36.320 --> 43:37.913
Sir, we're just about good here!

43:38.000 --> 43:40.515
- Sir, I got movement, second deck, 2-7.
- All right, back her up!

43:40.600 --> 43:41.875
Ready to go!

43:48.560 --> 43:49.710
Oh, fuck!

43:49.800 --> 43:51.473
I.E.D.! I.E.D.!

43:51.560 --> 43:52.710
Yeah!

44:00.920 --> 44:01.910
What the fuck!

44:22.440 --> 44:24.033
Pull that 50!

44:28.760 --> 44:30.991
We've got troops in combat!
Troops in combat!

44:32.680 --> 44:33.670
Go, go!

44:41.600 --> 44:42.875
- Take cover!
- Yes, sir!

44:42.960 --> 44:45.316
Pull the pin! Second deck! We're moving!

45:03.600 --> 45:04.590
We're taking it!

45:10.640 --> 45:12.518
Come on, sir!

45:12.600 --> 45:13.750
Fuck!

45:17.760 --> 45:18.876
Backtrack!

45:21.080 --> 45:25.996
What the hell are you doing?
It's a carbine rifle! Fuck!

45:26.080 --> 45:28.470
- Sir!
- Take it!

45:32.160 --> 45:33.560
Keep it coming! Keep it coming!

45:37.720 --> 45:39.916
We're good!

45:40.000 --> 45:42.310
What the fuck.
What the fuck are we doing here?

45:47.200 --> 45:48.190
Set!

45:51.360 --> 45:52.760
Grenade!

45:56.200 --> 45:57.475
Go, go, go!

46:04.680 --> 46:07.036
Is there a reason you
don't want to discuss

46:07.120 --> 46:09.157
what you saw in that room?

46:10.240 --> 46:13.358
- What I saw in the room, sir?
- Experienced.

46:15.720 --> 46:21.114
Gabriel, you've been through
a series of traumatic events.

46:22.600 --> 46:23.636
I don't know.

46:24.640 --> 46:26.871
I prefer if we just move on.
I'll be fine, sir.

46:26.960 --> 46:29.873
I'd assure you, these are things
you do not simply move on from.

46:29.960 --> 46:31.679
What do you suggest that I do, then?

46:31.760 --> 46:33.638
That's what we're here to sort out.

46:39.560 --> 46:42.155
Either way, we have
a mandatory date again.

46:43.160 --> 46:45.914
Yeah, funded by a government who'd
like to see people like me gone.

46:48.600 --> 46:50.080
Gone?

46:52.640 --> 46:54.313
You know, maybe if you looked
into the spiked suicide rates

46:54.400 --> 46:57.438
of military personnel in this country,
you'd know what you're looking for.

46:57.520 --> 46:59.318
And what would that be?

47:08.640 --> 47:10.916
Has that been a problem?

47:28.520 --> 47:31.513
- Gabriel.
- Yes, sir.

47:34.120 --> 47:36.316
You brought up suicide.

47:38.120 --> 47:41.113
Is there a reason you did that?

47:46.880 --> 47:48.599
I don't know.

47:52.520 --> 47:54.512
I just don't want my kid to hurt.

47:56.000 --> 47:57.434
Of course.

48:33.120 --> 48:35.351
You want to kill me, don't you?

48:39.920 --> 48:41.718
I just want to find my son.

48:49.360 --> 48:51.636
You're a Marine, huh?

49:00.600 --> 49:02.273
Hoorah.

49:08.360 --> 49:10.352
You know where my son is, Charles?

49:15.080 --> 49:17.436
I haven't seen anybody.

49:19.920 --> 49:22.355
I'd tell you if I did.

49:46.160 --> 49:47.674
What the fuck is that?

49:49.320 --> 49:50.549
What is that?

49:55.480 --> 49:57.358
There's people in that building.

49:58.680 --> 50:01.912
- Who are they?
- I don't... I don't know. I don't...

50:02.000 --> 50:04.037
- I don't see...
- Are they Americans?

50:04.120 --> 50:05.793
Fuck if I know, man.

50:05.880 --> 50:08.076
They might as well roll
the red carpet out on these borders,

50:08.160 --> 50:10.595
people they let
into this goddamned country.

50:15.160 --> 50:16.753
Holy fuck.

50:18.440 --> 50:20.835
Still not concerned about what
your friend here is up to, huh?

50:20.920 --> 50:22.354
That's a motherfucking cell phone, dog.

50:22.440 --> 50:24.159
Dev, there's people in my building.

50:24.240 --> 50:26.232
- In that building.
- What?

50:26.320 --> 50:27.390
There's people.

50:27.480 --> 50:29.199
You just said there was nobody here.

50:29.280 --> 50:31.272
- There's people in that building.
- Who's over there?

50:31.360 --> 50:32.555
They got kids in the building?

50:32.640 --> 50:34.279
There are kids over there?
What you seeing, Drummer?

50:34.360 --> 50:35.953
- They got kids in that building?
- Where you going?

50:36.040 --> 50:37.952
Hey, motherfucker!

50:38.040 --> 50:39.679
- Where you going, man?
- I'm not going anywhere.

50:39.760 --> 50:41.479
- Where you going? Huh?
- I'm not going anywhere.

50:41.600 --> 50:42.670
He's trying to run, man.

50:42.760 --> 50:44.433
Who are you calling on this phone?

50:44.560 --> 50:45.994
- I'm not calling...
- Who are you calling on this phone?

50:46.080 --> 50:47.275
What?

50:47.360 --> 50:48.919
- What is this?
- What do you see?

50:49.000 --> 50:50.275
- What did you see, Drummer?
- How did you get this?

50:50.400 --> 50:51.720
Are there kids over there?

50:51.800 --> 50:54.031
How did you get this envelope?
How did you get this envelope?

50:54.120 --> 50:56.760
- Listen, I don't know.
- How did you get this envelope?

50:56.840 --> 50:58.832
It's an envelope addressed to my kid.
My fucking envelope.

50:58.920 --> 51:00.036
- How do you have this envelope?
- It's addressed to Johnny?

51:00.160 --> 51:01.196
What do you know about that?

51:01.280 --> 51:02.760
- My envelope, it's not.
- What? What?

51:02.840 --> 51:04.513
It's my envelope. How the fuck
did you have my envelope?

51:11.080 --> 51:13.231
Wait, wait, wait! Fuck!

51:14.600 --> 51:16.239
No!

51:30.640 --> 51:31.994
Go left!

51:32.080 --> 51:34.037
- To the right!
- Overhead check clear!

51:34.120 --> 51:37.955
Team 4, Team 4!
We're moving to the second deck!

51:38.120 --> 51:40.954
We'll take them!

51:41.040 --> 51:42.190
So...

51:42.280 --> 51:45.751
I'd like to discuss,
if you would, the incident.

51:48.120 --> 51:52.478
I'd like to start
from your... your point of entry...

51:53.760 --> 51:55.877
what you saw and what you experienced.

51:59.400 --> 52:02.120
It was you and Corporal Devin Roberts.

52:03.720 --> 52:06.792
Corporal Roberts, myself,
Second Lieutenant Taylor.

52:10.160 --> 52:13.915
We entered the first floor,

52:14.920 --> 52:17.594
cleared and neutralized
the first floor, and then...

52:22.440 --> 52:24.511
We went to the second floor.

52:26.760 --> 52:29.798
Where there was a room.

52:32.280 --> 52:33.600
Yes, sir.

52:43.560 --> 52:45.153
On the fucking ground!

52:45.240 --> 52:47.596
On the ground! On the ground!

52:47.680 --> 52:49.876
- Clear left! Shit.
- On the ground!

52:49.960 --> 52:53.271
Boys, move it closer!
Come down! Get down! Get down!

52:53.360 --> 52:55.920
On the ground! Get on the ground!

52:56.000 --> 52:59.038
Hey, hey, come on! Get on the ground.

52:59.120 --> 53:02.955
Roberts! Roberts! Hey, take a breath.

53:03.040 --> 53:06.750
- Down. Down. On the ground.
- Are we clear?

53:07.760 --> 53:11.276
Yeah, we're clear right! On the ground.

53:11.360 --> 53:12.999
On the ground! Don't come at me.

53:13.080 --> 53:15.276
Get on the ground.

53:15.360 --> 53:16.589
Shit.

53:16.680 --> 53:20.071
Shh. Down. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.

53:20.160 --> 53:22.277
Drummer, we got this. Check that room!

53:22.360 --> 53:23.350
Roger.

53:23.440 --> 53:25.397
Keep time.

53:25.480 --> 53:26.994
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

53:27.080 --> 53:29.800
Get off me! Get on the ground.

53:39.200 --> 53:40.873
- Are we clear?
- Clear, Roberts.

53:42.200 --> 53:44.157
It's okay. Hey. Hey.

53:44.280 --> 53:46.317
- It's okay.
- Nice and easy.

53:47.920 --> 53:50.196
Lance Corporal, are we clear?

53:52.760 --> 53:55.719
- Drummer, are we clear?
- All clear!

54:01.160 --> 54:04.710
Room's clear, just checking on dead.

54:04.800 --> 54:06.951
I haven't checked those
motherfuckers over there yet.

54:07.040 --> 54:08.838
- Oh, he's good.
- He's good.

54:13.840 --> 54:17.720
Jesus Christ. Look at this fucking shit.

54:20.080 --> 54:21.560
Flat screens...

54:21.640 --> 54:24.439
Blue diamond... this is big bear actual,

54:24.520 --> 54:26.432
building secure, four insurgents down.

54:26.520 --> 54:28.989
Requesting immediate guys evac, over.

54:37.280 --> 54:38.270
Gun! Down!

54:40.520 --> 54:41.874
Come on.

54:41.960 --> 54:43.599
Oh, fuck.

54:45.440 --> 54:47.909
- You see that?
- I'm on it.

55:10.480 --> 55:13.917
- Drummer.
- Little joy.

55:33.920 --> 55:34.990
So...

55:37.520 --> 55:39.079
About the incident.

55:40.520 --> 55:42.910
You keep calling it "the incident."

55:45.600 --> 55:47.478
How does it make you feel?

55:49.640 --> 55:51.836
It makes me feel like shit.

55:55.120 --> 55:56.679
Let's write that down.

55:58.560 --> 56:00.472
Does that work?

56:09.320 --> 56:10.993
I'm sorry, sir.

56:15.760 --> 56:17.877
I felt betrayed.

56:19.440 --> 56:20.715
Betrayed?

56:28.720 --> 56:31.952
Yeah, I think if it was anybody but him,
I wouldn't feel like that.

56:33.080 --> 56:35.515
It was him.

56:36.920 --> 56:38.195
I see.

56:40.000 --> 56:43.914
I... I thought we were talking
about the incident in the room.

56:44.000 --> 56:48.438
What you call it... What is it?

56:48.520 --> 56:50.557
You keep going back to that incident.

56:59.800 --> 57:02.110
I thought the room was clear.

57:16.640 --> 57:19.360
The room was clear.

57:19.440 --> 57:20.430
Gun! Down!

57:22.080 --> 57:24.470
Goddamn it! Fuck!

57:36.560 --> 57:39.029
What the fuck...

57:42.560 --> 57:43.960
Oh, fuck.

57:48.680 --> 57:50.194
I got a civilian.

57:52.760 --> 57:54.080
Oh, Dev.

57:56.640 --> 57:58.552
Dev. Dev, I...

57:58.640 --> 58:00.552
Dev. Dev.

58:00.640 --> 58:02.791
Fuck. Where?

58:05.320 --> 58:06.913
Corpsman up!

58:21.480 --> 58:22.800
Johnny's great.

58:22.880 --> 58:24.553
I need a fucking corpsman now!

58:28.480 --> 58:30.631
I'm sorry. Sorry.

58:39.360 --> 58:42.637
Fight, Dev! Fight, motherfucker, fight!

58:42.720 --> 58:44.473
It was good to talk to you.

58:44.560 --> 58:46.870
I can't wait to see you.

58:47.000 --> 58:48.195
We'll see.

59:00.440 --> 59:02.159
All clear!

59:20.880 --> 59:22.030
Yes, sir.

59:52.880 --> 59:54.997
Yeah, I thought the area was secure.

59:55.080 --> 59:57.959
I thought it was clear. It wasn't.

59:58.040 --> 59:59.997
There was a mother and a son in there,

01:00:00.080 --> 01:00:03.152
and I can't take that back, you know?

01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:11.233
I can't rewind, you know. It's just...

01:00:12.720 --> 01:00:14.837
just one of them things.

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:55.989
Hey!

01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:58.276
Johnny, let's go!

01:02:15.280 --> 01:02:17.158
Hey, baby, let's go! I'm serious!

01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:27.195
Gabe.

01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:29.078
- Oh, my.
- Daddy!

01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:31.117
Hey... hey, go back upstairs, okay?

01:02:31.200 --> 01:02:33.112
Mommy's gotta talk...
Go back upstairs now!

01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:38.071
Hey, baby...

01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:41.153
Please...

01:02:46.840 --> 01:02:48.194
Oh, my God.

01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:58.471
I just feel like I'm dead, sir.
I don't give a shit anymore.

01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:02.436
You think about dying often?

01:03:04.120 --> 01:03:07.875
Oh, man, you just keep...
You know, I can't...

01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:11.192
I'm sorry, sir, I can't do this anymore.

01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:13.749
- Gabriel.
- I'm just trying to talk to you.

01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:15.433
What is the right answer, "yes"?

01:03:15.560 --> 01:03:18.120
Write "yes". What's the right answer?

01:03:18.200 --> 01:03:20.396
Write the right answer.
Just give me the right answer.

01:03:20.480 --> 01:03:22.119
- I'll say whatever you want me to say.
- The emails.

01:03:22.200 --> 01:03:25.511
Did you know before or after the incident?

01:03:25.600 --> 01:03:27.080
You keep calling it the fucking incident.

01:03:27.160 --> 01:03:28.674
You keep going back
to that fucking incident.

01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:33.358
The fact that another Marine was present at
the time is understandably cause for concern.

01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:39.677
You need a fall guy.

01:03:39.760 --> 01:03:42.070
That's what this is.
You just need a fall guy.

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:44.720
No, that's your paranoia speaking.

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:46.752
There's no agenda here.

01:03:46.840 --> 01:03:49.196
I'm simply trying
to understand what happened.

01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:51.556
You can't understand what happened.

01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:54.240
You will never understand
what I'm going through.

01:03:54.320 --> 01:03:55.993
- Maybe.
- No, not maybe.

01:03:56.080 --> 01:04:00.472
No, maybe I can understand guilt.
I can understand regret.

01:04:00.560 --> 01:04:03.871
I can understand betrayal.

01:04:03.960 --> 01:04:08.796
These are all human conditions.

01:04:08.880 --> 01:04:12.760
Now, you brought up suicide before,

01:04:12.840 --> 01:04:14.991
and that concerns me.

01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:21.153
Do you want to kill yourself, Gabriel?

01:04:21.240 --> 01:04:23.630
Do you really want to kill yourself?

01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:29.800
Yes.

01:04:29.880 --> 01:04:31.712
Then what stops you?

01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:44.676
This.

01:05:01.960 --> 01:05:03.553
Pop the trunk.

01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:16.153
So, what happens now,
I go home with this letter

01:05:16.240 --> 01:05:19.039
that says I was weak
and I couldn't handle it,

01:05:19.120 --> 01:05:20.634
- and everything's just fine again?
- No.

01:05:22.360 --> 01:05:24.317
Again, no.

01:05:24.440 --> 01:05:27.160
I'd like to offer up a few suggestions

01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:29.675
toward dealing with
those feelings, if I may.

01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:35.191
They're not feelings, sir. They're real.

01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:40.153
What happened in that room is real.

01:05:40.240 --> 01:05:41.720
What happened with my wife is real.

01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:44.440
Listen, that's an important statement
you just made.

01:05:44.520 --> 01:05:46.591
The physical world isn't a lie, Gabriel.

01:05:46.680 --> 01:05:49.673
You believed the room was clear.

01:05:53.480 --> 01:05:54.470
Yes?

01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:56.153
Yes, sir.

01:05:58.080 --> 01:05:59.753
It's not worth it.

01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:06.836
They say 90% of people

01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:09.071
supposedly regret it the second they jump.

01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:12.676
Where they fuck they
got that statistic, I don't know.

01:06:15.440 --> 01:06:16.635
Make it up.

01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:23.239
Word is, they could
strike anytime, anywhere.

01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:25.789
War's coming home.

01:06:25.880 --> 01:06:27.360
No one called me.

01:06:27.440 --> 01:06:29.591
What do you think I'm doing here?

01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:35.476
Mom.

01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:41.516
I don't know. What are you doing here?

01:06:41.640 --> 01:06:42.630
Gabe!

01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:45.954
- Listen...
- But, Mom, he's here.

01:06:46.040 --> 01:06:47.713
I'll come get you in a second. Go on.

01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:49.712
They're setting up
intelligence at our old base.

01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:51.917
- That doesn't trouble you?
- What troubles me is

01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.754
I got a mound of paperwork
saying I'm mentally incompetent.

01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:56.593
That troubles me a fuck ton.

01:06:58.280 --> 01:06:59.794
That got you home, didn't it?

01:07:01.520 --> 01:07:03.512
Look, I don't care
what they say about you.

01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:06.832
All right, this is end-of-the-world,
neck-deep-in-shit stuff.

01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:09.839
- I need you in it.
- I'm done.

01:07:12.760 --> 01:07:14.672
- You're never done.
- I'm done, Dev.

01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:22.193
Your first meeting back will be critical.

01:07:24.040 --> 01:07:25.599
For Jonathan.

01:07:26.880 --> 01:07:28.837
And you.

01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:40.199
I'd like to talk about
what you'll be returning to stateside.

01:07:40.280 --> 01:07:42.351
I mean, I know what I'm returning to.

01:07:42.440 --> 01:07:46.992
Yes, but in case it isn't
what you are expecting or hoping for.

01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:53.240
I'm not hoping for anything.

01:07:57.920 --> 01:08:02.199
I'm responsible for these
terrible things I can't change.

01:08:02.280 --> 01:08:03.555
Hey, Gabe.

01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:08.678
I just don't want the kid to hurt.
You know?

01:08:14.760 --> 01:08:15.989
Hey.

01:08:21.640 --> 01:08:23.916
Gabe, I need you to talk to him.

01:08:26.080 --> 01:08:27.957
Okay.

01:08:30.439 --> 01:08:33.080
Baby, I'm so sorry.

01:08:33.160 --> 01:08:36.915
I mean, it's fine if you
need to punish me still,

01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.515
- but I need you to...
- I'm not punishing you.

01:08:44.920 --> 01:08:46.479
Tell me what...

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:52.551
Tell me what to do.

01:08:54.040 --> 01:08:55.872
Take off your shirt.

01:08:58.840 --> 01:08:59.876
Really?

01:09:04.640 --> 01:09:05.710
Okay.

01:09:09.160 --> 01:09:10.674
Okay.

01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:39.519
Is this what you want?

01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:41.955
No.

01:09:56.200 --> 01:09:57.953
What can I do?

01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:05.079
Nothing.

01:10:28.520 --> 01:10:30.876
My watch says seven.
What's your world clock say?

01:10:34.160 --> 01:10:35.879
- Seven.
- Seven.

01:10:40.640 --> 01:10:43.030
Well, I guess our time is up, sir.

01:10:45.040 --> 01:10:47.509
I have nowhere to be.

01:10:47.600 --> 01:10:50.115
Would you like to continue?

01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:53.989
Your time is up, my time is up,
but thank you for yours.

01:10:54.080 --> 01:10:57.551
Drummer. Yo, Drummer, you copy?

01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:02.711
Yes, sir.

01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:06.999
The medication will be helpful.

01:11:07.080 --> 01:11:10.630
It's gonna take a lot more than that
to get you through this.

01:11:12.200 --> 01:11:14.351
There's no getting through
this, sir, admit it.

01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:19.960
Gabe!

01:11:20.040 --> 01:11:21.997
- Go back inside. Go back in side.
- But, Mommy, he's here.

01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:23.560
I'll come get you in a second. Go on.

01:11:23.640 --> 01:11:25.518
Why do they give a shit about me?

01:11:25.600 --> 01:11:28.354
They don't give a shit about me,
I don't give a shit about them, you know?

01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:29.920
Gabe.

01:11:31.880 --> 01:11:33.917
We can make this work.

01:11:36.280 --> 01:11:38.237
Come on, please.

01:12:00.040 --> 01:12:01.554
Nat!

01:12:01.640 --> 01:12:04.075
Where's my kid?

01:12:04.160 --> 01:12:06.914
I'm not gonna talk
to you if you don't calm down.

01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.229
You're not gonna what?

01:12:08.320 --> 01:12:09.993
I'm not gonna talk to you
if you don't calm down.

01:12:10.080 --> 01:12:11.719
I'm calm. Get my kid out here now.

01:12:11.800 --> 01:12:15.191
- Gabe, keep your voice down, please.
- Nat, I wanna see my kid.

01:12:15.280 --> 01:12:16.600
I know what they're doing
with the kids in school.

01:12:16.680 --> 01:12:18.751
I wanna see my child.
I want to see my kid now!

01:12:18.840 --> 01:12:21.230
I'm on the phone with the police
'cause you're scaring our kid.

01:12:21.320 --> 01:12:23.915
- Johnny!
- Stop. Calm the fuck down.

01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:26.913
- I wanna see my...
- Gabe, fucking stop! Stop!

01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.832
I want to see my kid!

01:12:28.920 --> 01:12:30.718
I'm a United States Marine.
I want to see my son!

01:12:30.800 --> 01:12:33.235
I know what's happening to kids
inside the school. I see 'em lining up.

01:12:33.320 --> 01:12:35.437
I want to see my fucking child!
Jon is in trouble.

01:12:35.520 --> 01:12:38.752
Gabe, stop! Stop!

01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:40.991
- Stop, Gabe!
- What'd you see, Drummer?

01:12:41.080 --> 01:12:43.231
I need the police. My husband's got a gun

01:12:43.320 --> 01:12:45.118
- and he's going to my kid's school.
- What's over there?

01:12:45.200 --> 01:12:46.429
What do I do?

01:12:49.760 --> 01:12:52.798
- Who are you?
- Answer the question.

01:12:52.880 --> 01:12:54.553
- Who are you?
- Charles, my name's Charles.

01:12:54.680 --> 01:12:55.796
Hoorah.

01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:58.480
How did you get this envelope?
It's an envelope

01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:00.512
addressed to my kid.
It's my fucking envelope.

01:13:00.600 --> 01:13:03.160
- I don't know what you're talking about!
- How did you get this fucking envelope?

01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:09.800
They're not feelings, sir. They're real.

01:13:11.040 --> 01:13:13.600
What happened in that room is real.

01:13:15.160 --> 01:13:17.277
What happened with my wife is real.

01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:37.116
Gabriel.

01:14:03.760 --> 01:14:05.319
Devin, I'm at the back entrance.
I'm going in.

01:14:35.760 --> 01:14:38.798
Hey, pal. Hey, it's Pop. You okay?

01:14:38.880 --> 01:14:39.996
- Daddy.
- Yeah.

01:14:40.120 --> 01:14:41.110
I need you to be quiet.

01:14:41.200 --> 01:14:43.317
We're gonna get out of
this place now, all right?

01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:45.312
- Okay? You trust me?
- Yeah. Yeah.

01:14:45.400 --> 01:14:48.472
I trust you. Come on, be a big boy now.

01:14:48.560 --> 01:14:49.789
Here we go. Up.

01:14:54.120 --> 01:14:56.316
Daddy. Daddy.

01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:58.039
Hold on.

01:14:58.120 --> 01:14:59.440
Dev, made contact. Coming out.

01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:01.000
- Johnny!
- Back, back, back, back.

01:15:01.080 --> 01:15:02.560
All right, you're okay. Come on.

01:15:02.640 --> 01:15:04.154
Johnny!

01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:05.594
- Watch your footing.
- Gabe!

01:15:10.240 --> 01:15:12.835
He's shooing in the house.
He's got my son.

01:15:12.920 --> 01:15:14.036
He's got my son. What do I do?

01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:16.077
Police!

01:15:16.160 --> 01:15:18.231
- Shit!
- Daddy!

01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:19.800
Shots fired!

01:15:30.240 --> 01:15:31.230
Go back in!

01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.994
You're okay. Okay. You're okay.
All right, we'll go over here.

01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:39.072
I'm going to go. Stay right there.

01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:41.800
- You okay, buddy? Huh? You okay?
- Yeah.

01:15:41.880 --> 01:15:44.111
Remember whatever happens,
you'll be fine, you understand?

01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:51.317
Dev, come in, Dev. Dev!

01:15:51.440 --> 01:15:52.840
The fucking thing, man.

01:15:54.960 --> 01:15:56.189
What's wrong with you?

01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:57.720
I'm scared.

01:15:57.800 --> 01:15:59.439
Hey, no, you're not.

01:15:59.520 --> 01:16:00.749
Huh?

01:16:00.840 --> 01:16:02.752
- Okay?
- Yeah.

01:16:05.840 --> 01:16:07.479
It's all right.

01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:11.270
Don't cry. You'll be fine. Okay?

01:16:11.360 --> 01:16:13.033
Yeah.

01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:18.791
You're gonna be okay.

01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:21.360
I'm sorry.

01:16:22.480 --> 01:16:23.470
Johnny, you'll be fine.

01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:30.356
Yeah.

01:16:30.480 --> 01:16:31.994
You know, I got something for you, too.

01:16:32.080 --> 01:16:34.595
Here. Remember that?

01:16:36.000 --> 01:16:39.357
- Who's that?
- It's me and Mom.

01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:40.760
She's your mom.

01:16:42.440 --> 01:16:44.557
She's my everything.

01:16:46.080 --> 01:16:47.309
She's your mom.

01:16:50.560 --> 01:16:52.153
That's my everything.

01:16:52.240 --> 01:16:53.720
Yeah.

01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:00.231
That's my everything.

01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:04.478
Jon, you'll be fine.

01:17:04.560 --> 01:17:06.631
Be strong. I got you, son.

01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:10.240
Police! Come out!

01:17:12.360 --> 01:17:13.510
Go! Go! Go!

01:17:13.600 --> 01:17:14.636
What's that?

01:17:14.720 --> 01:17:16.951
Gummy bears.

01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:20.556
Your favorite candy, right?
That's your favorite candy.

01:17:20.640 --> 01:17:21.630
Yeah.

01:17:22.720 --> 01:17:23.756
See, I remember.

01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:28.951
- Is that your favorite candy, huh?
- Yeah.

01:17:29.080 --> 01:17:31.117
- Yeah.
- The red ones, right?

01:17:33.560 --> 01:17:35.199
Johnny's favorite candy.

01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:36.396
- Hmm?
- Yeah.

01:17:47.120 --> 01:17:48.236
You eat them red ones.

01:17:48.320 --> 01:17:49.993
I'll be back in five seconds, okay?

01:17:51.800 --> 01:17:54.952
- Say, "Yeah, Dad, I understand."
- Yeah, Dad I understand.

01:17:57.040 --> 01:17:59.111
- Police, don't move!
- Daddy!

01:18:12.520 --> 01:18:13.874
Daddy!

01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.753
Johnny, don't look!

01:18:15.840 --> 01:18:19.311
- Johnny, don't look!
- Daddy!

01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:23.679
Gabriel! Gabriel!

01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:26.440
How do you know my name?
How do you know my name?

01:18:27.440 --> 01:18:29.397
Drummer, we got this. Check the last room.

01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:50.471
Okay. You okay?

01:18:50.560 --> 01:18:53.359
- Yeah. Yeah.
- Huh?

01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:54.874
Devin, Team 2 here, Dev.

01:18:58.240 --> 01:19:00.357
Dev, are you tracking me? Dev!

01:19:03.400 --> 01:19:05.198
I'm in deep shit here. Do you copy?

01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:08.352
Dev, do you... Fuck.

01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:16.192
We're okay. We're okay.

01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:17.350
Yeah.

01:19:22.480 --> 01:19:25.040
I don't even have the doctor's number.

01:19:27.360 --> 01:19:30.990
- Who are you?
- He's here. He's here.

01:19:31.120 --> 01:19:33.237
Who are you? Who are you?

01:19:34.920 --> 01:19:36.912
Stay right there, Jon.

01:19:38.760 --> 01:19:41.275
- Who are you?
- It's me.

01:19:42.600 --> 01:19:44.273
Who are you?

01:19:48.960 --> 01:19:49.950
Who are you talking to?

01:19:50.040 --> 01:19:51.520
It's me.

01:19:51.640 --> 01:19:54.235
Mom.

01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:56.960
I know what you're doing to the kids.

01:19:57.040 --> 01:19:59.600
My kid was with his mother. Where is she?

01:20:01.760 --> 01:20:03.274
Where is she?

01:20:03.400 --> 01:20:05.073
It's me.

01:20:06.440 --> 01:20:08.159
You aren't...

01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:09.600
Gabe.

01:20:09.680 --> 01:20:11.831
Where is she? Where's my kid's mother?

01:20:12.840 --> 01:20:15.480
Where is she? Where is she? Down.

01:20:15.560 --> 01:20:17.074
Get down, get down, get down.

01:20:18.360 --> 01:20:21.956
Where's my wife?
Natalie Drummer is my wife.

01:20:22.040 --> 01:20:23.190
Where is she?

01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:25.998
Where is she?

01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:29.796
Gabriel.

01:20:29.880 --> 01:20:31.872
- Where is she?
- No, Gabriel...

01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:34.270
Where is she?

01:20:34.360 --> 01:20:35.919
- Where is she?
- I'm right here!

01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.480
- Where is she?
- I'm right here.

01:20:37.600 --> 01:20:40.115
- Natalie Drummer, where is she?
- Gabriel, please.

01:20:40.200 --> 01:20:42.351
Where is she? Where is she?

01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:44.472
Where is my fucking wife?

01:20:53.560 --> 01:20:55.791
Don't. No, no, no.

01:20:55.880 --> 01:20:57.519
Don't.

01:21:13.200 --> 01:21:16.079
They're not feelings, sir. They're real.

01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:22.559
What happened in that room is real.

01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:32.674
Oh, my God.

01:21:39.920 --> 01:21:41.718
Oh, my...

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:57.072
Oh, my God.

01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:00.639
I'm sorry.

01:22:05.720 --> 01:22:07.393
Oh, my God.

01:22:11.640 --> 01:22:14.394
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:15.755
I'm sorry.

01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:23.119
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

01:22:23.200 --> 01:22:24.600
It's okay, Dad.

01:22:24.680 --> 01:22:26.160
I didn't mean it.

01:22:26.240 --> 01:22:27.560
I didn't know.

01:22:27.640 --> 01:22:30.394
I was confused. I was confused.

01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:32.711
I didn't know. I didn't know.

01:22:32.840 --> 01:22:34.593
Natty, I'm sorry.

01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:39.839
I was confused.
I didn't... I didn't... I didn't...

01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:20.437
You know, I was thinking about...

01:23:20.520 --> 01:23:22.352
I was thinking about...

01:23:22.440 --> 01:23:26.992
You know, in the old days,
we used to send letters.

01:23:32.840 --> 01:23:34.672
I wrote these for you.

01:23:39.120 --> 01:23:40.873
It was, like, a big process, you know?

01:23:40.960 --> 01:23:42.679
It was, like, impossible.

01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:44.911
You had to, like, write it by hand.

01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:56.071
So now we got email and Skype...

01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:59.119
It's almost like
I'm here already, you know?

01:24:04.840 --> 01:24:06.877
No!

01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:21.872
I'm ain't Mom, but I damn
sure am gonna tell my kid

01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:23.713
I love him when he gets
out the car, all right?

01:24:23.800 --> 01:24:24.950
- Yeah.
- So we gotta come up with

01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:27.072
some kind of little middle ground,

01:24:27.160 --> 01:24:28.389
like a secret word or something.

01:24:35.400 --> 01:24:36.720
What about "man down"?

01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:39.833
- Man down?
- That's pretty good.

01:24:39.920 --> 01:24:42.674
- Yeah, I like that.
- I like it, too.

01:24:42.760 --> 01:24:45.195
Damn sure is manly enough.

01:24:45.280 --> 01:24:47.840
You know? Nobody will know what we're
talking about when we say it.

01:24:50.480 --> 01:24:52.949
So anytime I want to say I love you,
what am I going to say to you?

01:24:53.040 --> 01:24:54.315
- Man down.
- All right, good.

01:24:54.440 --> 01:24:55.760
All right, get out the car.

01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:06.159
No! Johnny, no!

01:25:17.240 --> 01:25:19.880
Hey, man down.

01:25:19.960 --> 01:25:21.758
Man down.

01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:23.911
You little cowboy, go ahead.

01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:29.111
Have a good day, bud.

01:25:30.320 --> 01:25:31.754
You too.

01:25:37.720 --> 01:25:39.791
I love you.

01:25:41.560 --> 01:25:44.200
How much?
