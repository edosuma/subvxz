38:37.532 --> 38:38.751
But I think...

38:40.709 --> 38:44.017
I think those words...

38:44.060 --> 38:46.759
They don't have the same
meaning for me anymore.

38:52.460 --> 38:55.333
Because those words...

38:55.376 --> 39:00.120
they came with caveats
and pretense and lies,

39:00.163 --> 39:03.602
and for three years...

39:03.645 --> 39:06.996
and I don't feel the way
that I should when I see them,

39:07.040 --> 39:08.694
and I don't feel the way
that I should...

39:08.737 --> 39:09.869
[ voice breaking ]
when I hear them.

39:18.225 --> 39:20.358
It's like they got
hollowed out somehow.

39:22.011 --> 39:23.404
So let's not use
those words.

39:23.448 --> 39:25.928
What?

39:25.972 --> 39:28.888
Let's find other words.

39:28.931 --> 39:30.933
Hell, let's make our own
language if we have to...

39:33.066 --> 39:36.156
language that
he no longer can touch.
