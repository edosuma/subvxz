01:52.242 --> 01:53.635
- You sure,
this is the one you want?

01:55.332 --> 01:56.507
The box?

01:59.293 --> 02:01.643
We can get her into
something nice, you know.

02:01.643 --> 02:04.689
We have ceramic urns,
porcelain, silver...

02:04.689 --> 02:06.300
- Nah. She's good.

02:08.301 --> 02:09.651
- As you wish.

02:10.304 --> 02:11.566
My condolences.

02:11.566 --> 02:12.915
- Thanks.

02:20.966 --> 02:22.272
- See you later.

02:22.272 --> 02:23.621
- Hope not.

02:25.971 --> 02:32.282
- Is some part of you
still lingering about us?

02:34.110 --> 02:36.156
Or have you moved
onto what's next?

03:05.837 --> 03:07.622
- Were you dancing?
- No

03:07.622 --> 03:09.145
- No?
- Mm-mm.

03:10.364 --> 03:12.061
- Do you want them?

03:12.061 --> 03:15.673
- Oh, they closed up years ago.

03:18.981 --> 03:20.200
- I have to tell you something.

03:22.027 --> 03:23.203
- What?

03:24.639 --> 03:27.424
- I was dancing
- No!

03:27.424 --> 03:29.252
- I just didn't want you to
think I don't care.

03:29.252 --> 03:30.601
- I know. I know.

03:30.601 --> 03:32.081
- Cause I do.

03:32.081 --> 03:33.474
- I know.

03:36.303 --> 03:39.741
You're such a bad liar.

03:51.187 --> 03:52.623
Do you want to say something?

03:56.410 --> 03:59.456
- Um... sure.

04:04.244 --> 04:07.072
Thank you for giving me life...

04:08.900 --> 04:10.728
and the house.

04:25.874 --> 04:26.918
I can't believe
they make these things

04:26.918 --> 04:28.659
out of plastic.

04:33.185 --> 04:34.709
What, she's fish food,

04:34.709 --> 04:36.885
this thing's going
to last forever.

05:19.536 --> 05:22.060
- Oh my god, is this it?

05:24.498 --> 05:26.500
This is beautiful.

05:26.500 --> 05:28.153
- Let's get this shit over with.

06:28.039 --> 06:29.476
- Hey,

06:31.521 --> 06:33.262
do you see the resemblance?

06:44.882 --> 06:46.493
Anya.

06:53.587 --> 06:55.023
- Is that her?

06:57.199 --> 07:00.158
- Uh, yeah sure.
I mean I guess.

07:00.158 --> 07:01.725
I don't know.

07:01.856 --> 07:03.161
Ooh!

07:05.947 --> 07:08.036
How can a person
have so much shit?

07:08.036 --> 07:09.690
- Emmett!

07:09.690 --> 07:10.952
It's not shit.

07:13.607 --> 07:15.086
It's her life.

07:18.176 --> 07:19.700
- What are you doing?

07:20.178 --> 07:21.223
Come on.
You don't even wear makeup.

07:21.223 --> 07:22.529
What, are you gonna keep it?

07:22.529 --> 07:25.357
- I just had no idea
this place was so magical.

07:25.357 --> 07:27.185
We could do anything, like...

07:28.970 --> 07:31.886
we could start
a writer's retreat,

07:31.886 --> 07:35.063
or I don't know, if we come up
on weekends, or start a camp.

07:35.063 --> 07:37.935
- No. What are you, nuts?
- I was just thinking out loud.

07:40.677 --> 07:42.244
Can I ask you a question?

07:43.288 --> 07:45.073
- Yeah.

07:45.900 --> 07:49.469
- She never reached out to you,
not even once?

07:52.428 --> 07:54.212
Why do you think
she left you her home?

07:58.782 --> 08:00.088
Babe.

08:00.262 --> 08:01.393
Babe.

08:07.443 --> 08:09.271
- Do you know what
that sound is?

08:09.271 --> 08:10.968
- Mm-mm.

08:10.968 --> 08:13.318
I don't know what
that sound is...

08:13.318 --> 08:16.147
- I think it means you're
in your fertility window.

08:16.147 --> 08:18.323
- Mm...
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm pretty sure...

08:18.323 --> 08:20.412
- Technically, yes.
- No, no, it's not technically.

08:20.412 --> 08:23.415
That is science.
That is proven...

08:23.415 --> 08:27.507
There's an app for that.
There's an app for that.

08:27.507 --> 08:28.856
- I don't wanna do it
on your mother's bed.

08:28.856 --> 08:31.206
- Why? Come on, we can...
We can-- We can do it.

08:31.206 --> 08:35.340
I mean, it'll just be
a little weird.

08:35.340 --> 08:37.081
- Fun weird?
- It could be fun weird.

08:37.081 --> 08:38.866
There's only one way to know
if something's fun weird.

08:38.866 --> 08:41.912
- No. It's now fun weird.
It's real weird.

08:41.912 --> 08:43.914
- No. It's what?

08:46.874 --> 08:48.353
- Did you hear that?

08:48.658 --> 08:50.007
- There's nothing here.

08:55.186 --> 08:56.666
- Is that where she...?

08:59.843 --> 09:01.323
- I got it. I got it.

09:04.369 --> 09:05.545
It's nothing.

09:07.938 --> 09:10.245
What? What?

09:17.861 --> 09:20.211
- Baby, you shouldn't
be doing that. Babe.

09:20.211 --> 09:21.996
- No, it's fine.

09:22.344 --> 09:23.998
It's fine.
Really, it's not a big deal.

09:25.434 --> 09:27.567
I think you got it.

09:35.879 --> 09:37.098
Mm-mm.

09:45.976 --> 09:47.325
- You're not funny.

09:52.417 --> 09:53.854
Look at that.

09:55.986 --> 09:57.379
That's in good shape.

09:58.380 --> 09:59.947
That just needs
a little bit of love.

10:00.469 --> 10:02.123
Oh!

10:02.123 --> 10:03.254
- Don't. Is it bleeding?

10:03.254 --> 10:05.039
- Shit.

11:05.708 --> 11:08.145
- <i>Don't do that.</i><i>
- Stand up straight.</i>

11:08.145 --> 11:11.583
<i>Come on, smile. Smile.</i>

11:11.583 --> 11:14.804
<i>Do you love your mommy?</i><i>
Do you love your mommy?</i>

11:14.804 --> 11:15.805
<i>What are you doing?</i>

11:17.372 --> 11:18.895
<i>Sweetheart, stop that.</i>

11:18.895 --> 11:19.635
<i>Stop it.</i>

11:21.028 --> 11:23.073
- <i>It's my birthday, Mommy...</i>

11:28.688 --> 11:30.385
- It's when
you were just a baby.

11:31.255 --> 11:32.996
- <i>Don't! Emmett.</i>

11:32.996 --> 11:35.303
<i>Let me just... Oh my god.</i>

11:35.303 --> 11:37.827
<i>We're going to get that cut.</i>

11:37.827 --> 11:38.959
<i>Smile!</i>

11:49.186 --> 11:50.448
- If you're not
going to talk to me,

11:50.448 --> 11:51.754
we need to do chair reversal.

11:51.754 --> 11:53.234
- No, the realtor's
coming in two days.

11:53.234 --> 11:55.062
- I don't care about
selling this house!

11:57.412 --> 11:59.022
We need to do chair reversal.

11:59.022 --> 12:00.632
- No.

12:00.981 --> 12:04.071
No, no, fuck that.
No, I'm not doing that.

12:09.598 --> 12:11.165
- Emmett,

12:13.297 --> 12:15.778
will you please
tell me your problem?

12:15.778 --> 12:17.258
- I'm avoidant.

12:34.362 --> 12:36.799
Emmett,

12:36.799 --> 12:38.888
will you please
tell me your problem?

12:40.237 --> 12:41.543
- I'm Emmett.

12:43.501 --> 12:45.765
And my problem is, is that...

12:48.898 --> 12:52.075
I have a really
deep well of trauma

12:52.075 --> 12:54.730
because my mother abandoned me
at a really critical age,

12:57.037 --> 12:59.953
and now she's passed away,

12:59.953 --> 13:02.346
and I'm doing everything
I can not to deal with it.

13:04.044 --> 13:09.353
- So if you're already
going to therapy

13:09.353 --> 13:13.880
because I insisted and you're
saying that it's helping,

13:13.880 --> 13:16.099
and you've had
a really good attitude about it,

13:16.099 --> 13:18.885
even though our insurance
doesn't cover it.

13:18.885 --> 13:20.582
Why do you think
I feel the need

13:20.582 --> 13:22.149
to keep pushing you?

13:22.149 --> 13:24.804
- I think unconsciously that,
um...

13:26.718 --> 13:28.895
I'm trying to make up for
a childhood I never had

13:28.895 --> 13:30.853
by having a child of my own.

13:32.899 --> 13:34.552
I can't do that.

13:36.467 --> 13:37.642
I can't do that because

13:37.642 --> 13:40.123
I shouldn't want
a family to fix a problem

13:40.123 --> 13:41.951
that I refuse to deal with.

13:47.087 --> 13:48.610
- Fuck this.

13:49.654 --> 13:51.134
- Emmett!

13:55.965 --> 13:57.401
Emmett.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.587
- So you don't want to have
a baby with me?

14:16.203 --> 14:18.770
- You know how badly
I want a family.

14:18.770 --> 14:20.337
That's not what I'm saying.

14:30.957 --> 14:33.089
I need you to let go
and open up.

14:36.484 --> 14:37.572
- Have you ever
thought that maybe

14:37.572 --> 14:39.530
a little repression
is a good thing?

14:46.189 --> 14:47.756
Come on.

14:51.194 --> 14:52.587
Come on.

14:52.587 --> 14:53.718
They'll still be there
when you get back.

14:53.718 --> 14:55.111
Come on.

14:57.897 --> 14:59.550
Isn't this is about trust?
Come on.

15:00.508 --> 15:02.075
- I'm not repressing anything.
- No?

15:02.075 --> 15:03.380
- Mm-mm.

15:05.121 --> 15:06.818
- Then how come you never
learned how to swim?

15:08.342 --> 15:09.996
- You'd have to ask my mother.

15:15.784 --> 15:17.003
- Come on.

15:49.600 --> 15:51.037
- You alright?
- Yeah.

16:04.572 --> 16:05.442
- You alright?
- Mm-hmm.

16:05.442 --> 16:06.922
- OK.

16:22.503 --> 16:24.722
Hey, you're OK.

16:26.072 --> 16:28.074
Hey, I got you.
- OK.

16:28.074 --> 16:30.554
- I got you. OK?

16:30.554 --> 16:32.034
I got you.
You can trust me.

17:02.238 --> 17:04.066
When we got here, I didn't...

17:06.112 --> 17:07.939
I didn't recognize the house.

17:10.377 --> 17:13.815
I didn't recognize the kitchen.
I didn't recognize the table.

17:17.949 --> 17:19.864
When I went to the bathroom,
I saw this...

17:22.214 --> 17:23.867
this syringe.

17:27.523 --> 17:30.875
So I ran upstairs to my room.

17:34.314 --> 17:35.750
Are you listening?

17:35.750 --> 17:38.013
- Hmm.

17:38.013 --> 17:40.363
- I ran upstairs to my room.

17:40.363 --> 17:43.366
And it doesn't look the same,
you know?

17:43.366 --> 17:44.454
But I started to remember,

17:44.454 --> 17:47.544
I started to remember
things like my bed,

17:47.544 --> 17:49.068
you know,
with the sports sheets.

17:49.068 --> 17:51.679
I remembered
the John Starks poster

17:51.679 --> 17:53.420
I had hung up on the wall.

17:56.162 --> 17:58.207
This is me opening up.

18:01.341 --> 18:03.560
- You have to try this.

18:04.779 --> 18:07.173
- OK...

18:07.173 --> 18:08.652
OK.

18:10.306 --> 18:12.439
- OK. OK. OK.

18:14.049 --> 18:15.485
OK.

18:39.292 --> 18:41.207
I dreamed a dream...

18:57.005 --> 18:58.485
- Hey, careful.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.708
Careful, careful.

19:05.796 --> 19:07.842
Hey, be careful.

19:07.842 --> 19:09.409
All right.

19:09.409 --> 19:11.150
All right. Stop.

19:13.630 --> 19:14.718
Stop.

19:19.332 --> 19:21.421
- Hey, goddamn you.

19:21.421 --> 19:23.466
Hey.

19:23.466 --> 19:24.772
You alright?

19:27.862 --> 19:29.646
- I need to be in water.

19:39.395 --> 19:40.962
Come here.

20:25.006 --> 20:26.790
You're gonna let go.

21:16.623 --> 21:18.189
- Babe?

21:27.068 --> 21:28.461
Anya.

22:20.208 --> 22:22.079
- Have you repressed your pain?

22:24.995 --> 22:27.171
- Anya,
I really don't want to do this.

22:27.171 --> 22:28.521
- Are you angry?

22:30.653 --> 22:32.002
- No.

22:32.002 --> 22:34.048
- Are you angry
with your girlfriend?
- No.

22:34.048 --> 22:36.833
- Do you hate your girlfriend?
- No, of course not.

22:37.660 --> 22:39.183
- Do you hate your mother?

22:39.183 --> 22:40.402
- No.

22:40.402 --> 22:41.882
- Do you miss your mother?

22:42.665 --> 22:44.275
- No.

22:44.275 --> 22:45.755
- Do you miss your mother?

22:47.061 --> 22:48.279
- No.

22:48.279 --> 22:50.064
- Do you ever wonder
why she abandoned you?

22:51.326 --> 22:52.980
- No.
- Do you ever wonder why?

22:52.980 --> 22:54.068
- No.

22:54.068 --> 22:55.461
- Why do you want to
have a child?

22:55.461 --> 22:56.505
- Because I love you.

22:56.505 --> 22:58.681
- Why do you want to have
a child?

22:58.681 --> 23:00.640
- What do you what do you want?
Fucking human nature?

23:00.640 --> 23:01.902
Anya, I don't know.

23:01.902 --> 23:03.599
- Because your mother
abandoned you
- No.

23:03.599 --> 23:05.384
- Do you ever wonder why
she abandoned you?

23:06.515 --> 23:07.429
- No.

23:07.429 --> 23:09.736
- Why?
- I don't give a shit.

23:09.736 --> 23:11.041
- Do you want to know why
she abandoned you?

23:11.041 --> 23:13.087
- I want to stop
playing this game.

23:26.492 --> 23:28.494
- Do you want to know
why I abandoned you?

23:32.541 --> 23:33.760
- I don't like this.

23:33.760 --> 23:36.110
- You blame yourself.
- Stop it.

23:36.110 --> 23:39.287
- Do you want to know
why I abandoned you?
- I said fucking stop it, Anya!

23:46.250 --> 23:47.774
What the fuck?

24:31.121 --> 24:32.253
Anya!

24:34.255 --> 24:35.169
Anya!

24:35.169 --> 24:37.214
Oh, shit, babe.

24:37.214 --> 24:39.695
Babe. Babe. Babe.

24:39.695 --> 24:43.743
- Did I hurt you?
I didn't mean to hurt you.

24:43.743 --> 24:46.049
Did I hurt you?
- No.

24:59.062 --> 25:00.586
- <i>Do you love your mommy?</i>

25:02.588 --> 25:04.154
<i>What are you doing?</i>

25:10.987 --> 25:12.598
<i>There he is.</i>

25:14.904 --> 25:16.036
<i>There he is.</i>

25:16.036 --> 25:18.647
<i>Oh, look at you,</i><i>
what's happening here?</i>

25:18.647 --> 25:20.214
<i>Come on, come on. Chin up.</i>

25:31.181 --> 25:32.226
<i>Emmett.</i>

26:04.214 --> 26:05.738
- I'm gonna go drop
some stuff off

26:05.738 --> 26:07.870
at a thrift store.

26:07.870 --> 26:10.003
Then I'm gonna go pick up
like a bagel or something

26:10.003 --> 26:12.353
on the way back, I'm starving.

26:12.353 --> 26:13.746
Do you want anything?

26:16.357 --> 26:18.533
I'm sorry things
got heated last night.

26:33.766 --> 26:35.681
Fuck, Anya.

26:35.681 --> 26:40.729
Hey, Anya, baby,
I need those keys.

26:43.471 --> 26:45.647
Realtor is coming tomorrow,
we've barely done anything,

26:45.647 --> 26:47.518
I need the keys, Anya.

26:48.824 --> 26:50.565
Anya!

27:13.632 --> 27:14.589
Yes?

27:16.069 --> 27:18.114
- It's... it's Bill.

27:18.941 --> 27:20.421
From up the street.

27:22.466 --> 27:24.077
- OK.
Can I help you with something?

27:24.077 --> 27:25.687
- I was driving to town

27:25.687 --> 27:28.516
and I saw the car parked here,
and I thought,

27:28.516 --> 27:29.952
somebody is breaking in, maybe.

27:29.952 --> 27:34.522
- No,
that's, that's my car, my house.

27:34.522 --> 27:35.479
- I'm sorry.

27:35.479 --> 27:36.437
- No, it's OK.

27:36.437 --> 27:37.960
- Oh hey, if you need anything,

27:37.960 --> 27:40.484
um, you know,
it's the yellow house,

27:40.484 --> 27:41.747
top of the hill.

27:41.747 --> 27:42.791
You can't miss it.

27:45.620 --> 27:47.535
So your foot healed fine, huh?

27:48.275 --> 27:49.493
- My foot?

27:51.974 --> 27:53.889
- Yeah.
I never worry about working out.

27:53.889 --> 27:55.021
Never have.

27:55.021 --> 27:57.023
I've got the farm
to keep me busy.

27:57.023 --> 27:58.633
I sleep good.
I can tell you that.

27:58.633 --> 28:00.417
- Yeah, no, I work.

28:00.417 --> 28:02.463
You know,
I'm on my feet all day, too.

28:02.463 --> 28:03.682
If I don't go for
a run in the morning,

28:03.682 --> 28:04.770
I lose my shit.

28:04.770 --> 28:06.597
- Wonder who you got that from?

28:07.598 --> 28:09.035
You probably don't want to
talk about your mom.

28:09.035 --> 28:10.906
- It's fine.

28:10.906 --> 28:15.171
My fiancee says I need to be
more open about these things.

28:15.171 --> 28:17.217
She says I'm avoidant.

28:18.305 --> 28:20.394
"Maladaptive coping"
she calls it.

28:20.394 --> 28:22.178
"Maladaptive."
Whatever the hell that is.

28:23.658 --> 28:25.965
You know, look,
I got nothing to hide.

28:25.965 --> 28:28.619
I'm really grateful to Tracy
for leaving us the house.

28:28.619 --> 28:30.665
Whatever we can get
for it is going to be huge.

28:30.665 --> 28:32.014
- You're just going to flip it?

28:32.014 --> 28:33.276
- Yeah.

28:34.800 --> 28:37.019
You know, Anya and me,
we're trying to start a family.

28:37.019 --> 28:39.369
So...

28:39.369 --> 28:41.284
- Is that her?

28:41.284 --> 28:43.722
She got you on that short leash?

28:43.722 --> 28:46.202
- No, no, that's...

28:49.031 --> 28:52.643
It's our ovulation app.

28:53.819 --> 28:55.603
- Keep that thing
away from your junk,

28:55.603 --> 28:57.213
I'll tell you that.

28:57.213 --> 28:59.563
I'm probably twice
as fertile as you are.

28:59.563 --> 29:01.609
No offense,
I don't carry one around.

29:01.609 --> 29:03.393
Some day
it's going to come out

29:03.393 --> 29:06.527
just how much
radiation the GPS app

29:06.527 --> 29:08.094
in that thing gives off.

29:08.094 --> 29:09.312
It'll fry your nuts.

29:09.312 --> 29:10.966
I mean really,
they'll drop the fuck off.

29:14.056 --> 29:15.405
You're sure you're OK
to get back?

29:15.405 --> 29:18.147
- Yeah. I got the GPS.

29:18.147 --> 29:20.019
- I told you.
- Yeah. Yeah.

29:20.019 --> 29:21.368
- It'll fry your nuts.
- Yeah, right.

29:21.368 --> 29:22.935
I appreciate it, though.
Thanks.

29:22.935 --> 29:24.066
- OK.

29:25.328 --> 29:28.505
- Hey, Tracy, knitted those.

29:28.505 --> 29:29.898
Are you going to
give those away?

29:32.553 --> 29:34.773
- You want them?
- Oh, thanks, yeah. Yeah.

29:35.904 --> 29:36.992
Great.

29:36.992 --> 29:38.515
- Thanks again
- You bet.

30:39.141 --> 30:40.577
- Hey, is something burning?

30:51.197 --> 30:52.851
Anya.

31:14.481 --> 31:15.786
What are you doing?

31:20.748 --> 31:22.532
Anya, are you smoking?

31:30.192 --> 31:32.020
Babe, wait a minute.

31:32.455 --> 31:34.370
Wait, wait, wait...

31:34.370 --> 31:36.242
Stop. Stop.
Why are you smoking?

31:36.242 --> 31:38.287
- Emmett, enough.
- Stop. Why are you smoking?

31:38.287 --> 31:40.159
- Will you get out of my way?
It is going to burn.

31:40.159 --> 31:41.508
- Anya.
What is happening?

31:42.552 --> 31:43.945
- Jesus, Emmett!

31:51.910 --> 31:53.824
Do you not like
pizza anymore?

32:07.186 --> 32:08.796
- The fuck are we doing?

32:10.580 --> 32:13.322
- Hmm.
You have terrible posture.

32:20.895 --> 32:22.505
Come here.

32:28.294 --> 32:29.904
- Stop.

32:30.165 --> 32:34.126
- Hey, I'm sorry I got mad.

32:35.866 --> 32:38.391
I want us to have
a nice time together.

32:40.349 --> 32:43.918
I'm so happy you've come home,
my little wild-thing.

32:43.918 --> 32:45.311
- What?

32:49.489 --> 32:50.794
- Wait.

32:53.406 --> 32:54.885
Your plate.

33:30.617 --> 33:32.923
Do you need something?

33:32.923 --> 33:34.969
- You made your point, OK?

33:37.145 --> 33:39.060
It's weird
that I don't remember.

33:39.060 --> 33:40.714
- You don't remember who?

33:42.846 --> 33:44.283
Me?

33:47.547 --> 33:49.288
Wait, wait, wait.

33:49.288 --> 33:51.290
- Anya!
- Look at me.

33:51.290 --> 33:53.031
What do you mean?

33:53.814 --> 33:55.642
Of course you remember me.

33:57.992 --> 33:59.298
If I really meant
nothing to you,

33:59.298 --> 34:01.039
you wouldn't be so reactive.

34:02.736 --> 34:04.303
You need to work on your anger.

34:06.087 --> 34:07.871
It isn't healthy.

34:21.362 --> 34:22.799
- Alright.

34:29.371 --> 34:31.938
I know I need to work on myself.

34:34.420 --> 34:35.943
You're right.

34:38.598 --> 34:40.600
And I'm trying.

34:44.299 --> 34:46.301
I'm trying.

34:48.608 --> 34:51.176
And I will do
whatever I need to do

34:51.176 --> 34:53.699
to be the partner
that you deserve.

34:59.575 --> 35:01.142
Alright?

35:19.204 --> 35:20.857
What the hell.

35:21.684 --> 35:23.338
Raj, what's up, man?

35:23.904 --> 35:26.254
Uh, I'm alright.
How are you?

35:26.254 --> 35:27.951
You good? Good? Good?

35:27.951 --> 35:30.084
Yeah, um...

35:30.084 --> 35:31.694
You ever trip with somebody

35:31.694 --> 35:33.957
and they, they start acting
like another person?

35:35.133 --> 35:37.091
What about like,
all the way into the next day?

35:38.484 --> 35:40.138
Yeah. Mm-hmm.

36:48.075 --> 36:49.642
- Goodnight, Emmett.

38:00.974 --> 38:02.715
Yoo-hoo.

38:12.072 --> 38:13.726
Good morning, Emmy.

38:15.293 --> 38:17.251
- Since when do you
know how to fry an egg?

38:20.820 --> 38:22.561
- Do you prefer them scrambled?

38:23.518 --> 38:25.738
- No, thank you.

39:04.211 --> 39:06.692
<i>I crave</i><i>
his forgiveness.</i>

39:06.692 --> 39:08.302
<i>Deep and primal.</i>

39:10.304 --> 39:13.394
<i>And yet his return is stenched</i><i>
with this dread of burden.</i>

39:14.743 --> 39:16.571
<i>He's as needy as ever.</i>

39:19.357 --> 39:21.402
<i>I thought I could be</i><i>
what I never was.</i>

39:21.402 --> 39:23.752
<i>As if I'm not who I am.</i>

39:25.841 --> 39:28.322
<i>Why was my heart cursed</i><i>
to be his forever?</i>

39:31.369 --> 39:32.631
Emmett, knock!

39:32.631 --> 39:34.937
- "Why was my heart cursed
to be his forever?"

39:36.417 --> 39:38.767
- How dare you read that?

39:38.767 --> 39:40.247
Give it to me.

39:43.250 --> 39:44.904
- What are you doing?

39:45.470 --> 39:47.472
- Going into town to pick up
a rotisserie chicken.

39:47.472 --> 39:49.430
Since you find my
cooking so offensive.

39:50.997 --> 39:52.259
- Well you look like
you're going to the opera.

39:52.259 --> 39:54.174
- In this town?

39:54.174 --> 39:56.176
When pigs fly out of my ass.

39:56.176 --> 39:57.786
Give me my journal.

39:58.700 --> 40:00.093
Now.

40:06.012 --> 40:09.407
Hmm. Stop staring.

40:09.407 --> 40:11.104
Get out.

41:29.008 --> 41:30.400
- Emmett.

41:32.054 --> 41:34.100
Is now a bad time?

41:34.100 --> 41:35.841
- No, oh.

41:35.841 --> 41:39.061
Um, no, no, no, sorry, sorry.
Now's perfect.

41:44.719 --> 41:47.548
Such a unique property.

41:47.548 --> 41:49.985
Love the exposed beams.

41:49.985 --> 41:51.857
- So you think
it's worth something?

41:51.857 --> 41:53.989
- Yes,
but keep the windows open,

41:53.989 --> 41:55.774
we need to clear that smell.

41:55.774 --> 41:58.777
Smoking is a real deal breaker
for a lot of people,

41:58.777 --> 42:01.040
especially these young couples.

42:01.040 --> 42:03.346
And that's all that seems
to be buying these days.

42:03.346 --> 42:04.652
Folks leaving the city

42:04.652 --> 42:08.177
looking to spread out
and reproduce.

42:08.177 --> 42:10.528
Is that your wife?

42:12.225 --> 42:16.490
- No, no, no, no.
That's my mom.

42:16.490 --> 42:18.579
- How sweet of you to have this.

42:18.579 --> 42:19.754
- That's not mine

42:22.278 --> 42:23.671
- I didn't want to say anything,

42:23.671 --> 42:28.763
but this place
seems really off the grid.

42:30.504 --> 42:32.550
You know, I would love to spend

42:32.550 --> 42:35.378
a little extra
and freshen things up.

42:35.378 --> 42:37.250
Get rid of these antique chairs.

42:37.250 --> 42:38.817
Rip out all of this junk.

42:38.817 --> 42:40.558
Oh!

42:41.907 --> 42:43.996
My goodness. You startled me.

42:43.996 --> 42:45.867
- Hmm. You are...?

42:48.522 --> 42:50.306
- The listing agent.

42:51.656 --> 42:54.267
- Anya. Anya.

42:57.009 --> 42:58.663
- Get out.
- No

42:58.663 --> 42:59.968
- Is there a problem?
- There's no problem.

42:59.968 --> 43:01.143
You don't have to go anywhere.
There's no problem.

43:01.143 --> 43:03.406
- It's not his house.
- It is my house.

43:03.406 --> 43:04.799
It's my house.

43:04.799 --> 43:06.845
It's my house.
OK, my house.

43:06.845 --> 43:09.151
My mom left it
to me in her will.

43:09.151 --> 43:10.413
OK?

43:10.979 --> 43:13.721
- My condolences.
- It's fine.

43:13.721 --> 43:15.070
I'll come back tomorrow morning.

43:15.070 --> 43:16.506
- Thank you.
- Mm-hmm.

43:20.336 --> 43:21.642
Listen--

43:23.252 --> 43:24.689
Unbelievable.

43:24.689 --> 43:27.169
Even for you, Anya,
this is fucking unbelievable.

43:27.169 --> 43:28.475
Goddamn it.

43:28.475 --> 43:30.738
- No. No, you're wrinkling them.

43:30.738 --> 43:32.479
- What are you talking about,
wrinkling them?

43:32.479 --> 43:34.133
Wrinkling them?
You've never...

43:34.133 --> 43:36.439
Stop! Eh! Stop.

43:36.439 --> 43:37.832
Stop.

43:37.832 --> 43:39.094
This is how you pack.

43:40.574 --> 43:41.880
Baby,
you've never folded anything

43:41.880 --> 43:44.056
in your entire life.

43:44.056 --> 43:46.101
And all of a sudden you tidy.

43:46.101 --> 43:47.712
No, you stop! You tidy.

43:47.712 --> 43:49.888
You make the bed,
you make me eggs.

43:49.888 --> 43:51.933
You make me fucking bacon! Stop!

43:58.287 --> 43:59.811
I'm taking you to your mother's.

44:11.431 --> 44:13.215
- I'm not going anywhere.

44:18.046 --> 44:20.266
This is my house.

45:07.269 --> 45:08.531
- You took mushrooms
when you were pregnant?

45:08.531 --> 45:10.098
- I didn't.

45:10.098 --> 45:11.621
- You wanna fuck with me,

45:11.621 --> 45:12.971
That's fine,
but I'm not going to let you

45:12.971 --> 45:14.363
fuck with our baby.

45:14.363 --> 45:15.713
- What is this, Emmett?
Is this some kind of game?

45:15.713 --> 45:16.844
That's enough.

45:16.844 --> 45:19.847
- Are you kidding me?
Give me this shit.

45:19.847 --> 45:21.588
- Why are you torturing me?

45:21.588 --> 45:23.808
- Is this some shit you
and your mom came up with?

45:23.808 --> 45:27.028
Some kind of bullshit, twisted
cognitive behavioral therapy.

45:27.028 --> 45:29.509
- Do you not know how
a woman's body works?

45:29.509 --> 45:30.858
I can't have a baby.

45:32.164 --> 45:33.252
I can't have a baby!

45:33.252 --> 45:35.297
- Oh, fuck.

45:35.297 --> 45:36.777
- Oh my god, Emmett!

45:40.259 --> 45:41.042
- Look.

45:43.218 --> 45:44.829
You can't even look at it,
can you?

45:44.829 --> 45:47.614
There's only so much
pretending you can do, Anya.

45:47.614 --> 45:48.789
Huh?

45:51.400 --> 45:52.619
God.

46:30.265 --> 46:31.266
- Every morning.

46:32.615 --> 46:35.096
Any time she was
stressed, really.

46:35.096 --> 46:36.794
Body therapy, she called it.

46:37.795 --> 46:40.188
And then there were
her evening swims.

46:42.190 --> 46:45.063
But is that all you came here
to ask me about, yoga?

46:47.761 --> 46:51.591
Oh, don't worry,
I'm not your father.

46:51.591 --> 46:56.378
No, I was just a hired hand.
She paid me when she could.

46:56.378 --> 47:02.036
No, your father was
a guy who drove a motorcycle,

47:02.036 --> 47:07.085
lived in
a artist's loft in Soho.

47:07.085 --> 47:08.390
That's all I know about him.

47:08.390 --> 47:10.131
Honestly, I don't think
she knew much more.

47:10.915 --> 47:12.742
- Why did she--
- What, have you?

47:17.660 --> 47:19.793
Try to forgive her, son.

47:19.793 --> 47:21.186
She tried.

47:22.927 --> 47:24.232
Believe me,

47:24.232 --> 47:27.496
she never got over losing
her little wild thing.

47:33.024 --> 47:34.155
- Emmy.

47:38.246 --> 47:39.508
So, where are they?

47:40.683 --> 47:42.163
Hmm?

47:42.163 --> 47:43.382
That's how you're doing it,
right?

47:43.382 --> 47:44.905
- Doing what?

47:45.427 --> 47:47.038
- Her journals.

47:47.038 --> 47:48.604
- This is what
you're looking for.

47:48.604 --> 47:50.171
I found it on my dresser.

47:51.912 --> 47:54.567
"Is there some part of you
still lingering about us,

47:54.567 --> 47:56.482
"like some drunken
reveler clinging to

47:56.482 --> 47:59.050
the end of her night?"

47:59.050 --> 48:01.269
It's trying very hard, but....

48:03.097 --> 48:05.360
- What?

48:05.360 --> 48:07.710
- It's just funny, Anya

48:07.710 --> 48:09.538
- Who is Anya?

48:12.498 --> 48:13.934
- Well.

48:15.370 --> 48:18.852
In theory, she's my fiancee.

48:18.852 --> 48:20.027
- Oh,

48:22.725 --> 48:24.553
so it's serious?

48:24.553 --> 48:26.381
- She's pregnant.

48:26.381 --> 48:28.166
- This is juicy.

48:28.166 --> 48:29.341
Tell me everything.

48:29.341 --> 48:31.952
Wait, let's grease the wheels.

48:35.173 --> 48:41.353
So, things are complicated.

48:42.223 --> 48:43.703
- You can say that.

48:44.617 --> 48:46.184
Yeah.

48:46.184 --> 48:48.360
You could also say she's a...

48:49.883 --> 48:52.059
a master head-fucker.

48:52.059 --> 48:53.234
- Emmett!

48:53.234 --> 48:55.584
Now who taught you
to be such a chauvinist?

48:55.584 --> 48:57.499
Mm-mm.
It certainly wasn't me.

48:57.499 --> 48:59.110
- She thinks I'm all fucked up

48:59.110 --> 49:01.242
because I had such
a shitty childhood.

49:03.549 --> 49:05.768
Her mother never even
taught her how to swim.

49:07.248 --> 49:09.207
- Hmm.

49:09.207 --> 49:10.817
How is that even possible?

49:14.516 --> 49:19.086
- Well her mother is this
fancy psychoanalyst,

49:19.086 --> 49:22.350
which makes Anya think
that she has the qualifications

49:22.350 --> 49:25.875
to do some kind of quack therapy

49:25.875 --> 49:30.315
to get people to
talk about their, you know,

49:30.315 --> 49:33.318
like deep, dark shit.

49:33.318 --> 49:35.189
But really, she's...

49:38.018 --> 49:39.802
just a poet.

49:44.111 --> 49:48.246
Actually, she's never even made
a dime writing poetry,

49:50.857 --> 49:55.427
she's really just
a frustrated copywriter.

50:14.359 --> 50:16.491
Is it so bad that
the mother of your child

50:16.491 --> 50:18.058
wants you to open up?

50:19.929 --> 50:21.496
She thinks I only
want to have a child

50:21.496 --> 50:23.368
because my mother abandoned me.

50:27.372 --> 50:28.895
- Hmm.

50:31.724 --> 50:33.334
Is that what
you think happened?

50:55.922 --> 50:57.619
It starts with your back.

51:30.043 --> 51:32.959
Well, you are really just...

51:39.879 --> 51:41.576
You're not what I expected.

51:47.582 --> 51:49.367
If this Anya of yours,

51:49.367 --> 51:51.978
is all the things you say,

51:58.419 --> 52:00.029
why not just walk away?

52:03.990 --> 52:06.035
- I guess maybe because

52:09.648 --> 52:12.172
she's the only woman
that ever loved me?

52:12.172 --> 52:13.565
- Hmm.

52:21.747 --> 52:23.531
You want to know
about your mother?

52:47.425 --> 52:49.166
- Did you want me?

52:57.609 --> 52:59.915
- It was more of
a need than a want.

53:03.223 --> 53:05.138
I don't even know
where the need came from.

53:10.970 --> 53:13.146
I tried.

53:15.496 --> 53:16.932
Emmy.

53:18.934 --> 53:21.198
I really, really tried.

53:31.382 --> 53:33.035
- OK.

53:44.699 --> 53:46.310
<i>Do you love</i><i>
your mommy?</i>

53:46.310 --> 53:48.007
Do you love your mommy?

53:48.007 --> 53:49.313
<i>What are you doing?</i>

53:50.575 --> 53:53.491
<i>Sweetheart, stop that.</i><i>
Stop it.</i>

53:53.491 --> 53:57.712
<i>Say, "It's my birthday, Mommy</i><i>
and I love you."</i>

53:57.712 --> 54:00.585
<i>Hold on one second.</i><i>
Hold still.</i>

54:00.585 --> 54:03.196
<i>Do you love me?</i><i>
Say, "I love you, Mommy."</i>

54:03.196 --> 54:06.286
<i>Sweetheart, don't do that to me.</i>

54:44.324 --> 54:45.760
- Honey?

54:47.109 --> 54:50.374
Hey, you're having
a nightmare, OK?

55:28.847 --> 55:30.196
- Anya!

55:39.161 --> 55:40.815
No, no, no. Shit!

55:42.469 --> 55:43.818
Anya!

56:09.670 --> 56:11.977
- Emmett.
What are you doing?

56:33.302 --> 56:34.739
- You can't swim.

56:43.312 --> 56:45.445
You can't swim.

56:54.889 --> 56:56.413
Please don't leave me.

56:59.328 --> 57:03.115
Please don't leave me.

57:03.115 --> 57:04.638
Please.

57:05.857 --> 57:07.598
Please don't leave me.

57:10.775 --> 57:12.516
Please.

57:15.432 --> 57:17.259
Please.

58:48.655 --> 58:50.352
- How are you feeling?

58:51.571 --> 58:53.094
- Hungry.

58:55.401 --> 58:58.447
- I feel like I slept
with my head underwater.

59:00.275 --> 59:02.016
Wanna go into town
and find something to eat?

59:04.541 --> 59:06.455
- Can't you like make me eggs
or something?

59:07.979 --> 59:09.415
- You want me to make you eggs?

59:13.680 --> 59:15.247
What is it?

59:17.075 --> 59:18.555
Emmett.

59:23.255 --> 59:25.213
Where are you going?

59:25.213 --> 59:26.780
- For a run.

01:01:44.178 --> 01:01:45.484
- Talk to me.

01:01:56.103 --> 01:01:58.627
Will you please tell me
what happened last night?

01:02:03.981 --> 01:02:05.722
- That was three nights ago.

01:02:51.376 --> 01:02:52.856
- Hey.

01:02:59.863 --> 01:03:01.560
Don't shut me out.

01:03:26.585 --> 01:03:28.195
I don't want to push you away.

01:03:35.463 --> 01:03:37.335
I want to be close to you.

01:03:42.557 --> 01:03:44.211
- Just... stop.

01:04:11.151 --> 01:04:13.501
What are you doing?
- But--

01:04:13.501 --> 01:04:15.112
- We haven't gone
through that yet.

01:04:15.112 --> 01:04:16.678
- I thought you wanted to
throw everything out.

01:04:21.509 --> 01:04:23.207
- OK, don't talk to me.

01:05:06.337 --> 01:05:07.991
- <i>Do you love your mommy?</i>

01:05:07.991 --> 01:05:09.340
<i>What are you doing?</i>

01:05:10.515 --> 01:05:11.951
<i>Sweetheart, stop that.</i>

01:05:11.951 --> 01:05:13.431
<i>Stop it.</i>

01:05:13.431 --> 01:05:17.174
<i>Say, "It's my birthday, Mommy</i><i>
and I love you."</i>

01:05:17.174 --> 01:05:20.133
<i>Hold on one second.</i><i>
Just hold still.</i>

01:05:20.133 --> 01:05:22.744
<i>Do you love me?</i><i>
Say, "I love you, Mommy."</i>

01:05:22.744 --> 01:05:25.791
<i>"I love--"</i><i>
Sweetheart, don't lament--</i>

01:05:25.791 --> 01:05:27.793
<i>Let me just--</i><i>
Oh, my goodness.</i>

01:05:28.837 --> 01:05:32.102
<i>We're going to get that cut.</i><i>
Smile.</i>

01:05:32.102 --> 01:05:34.365
<i>It's your birthday.</i>

01:05:34.365 --> 01:05:36.845
<i>It's your...</i><i>
Oh, my goodness.</i>

01:06:36.818 --> 01:06:38.559
- I got you an apology bagel.

01:06:44.739 --> 01:06:46.306
Are you OK?

01:07:14.378 --> 01:07:15.596
- Alright.

01:07:17.120 --> 01:07:18.469
It starts with the back.

01:07:20.471 --> 01:07:22.212
- What does?

01:07:22.212 --> 01:07:24.083
- Just... just try.

01:07:38.097 --> 01:07:40.056
- Sorry, it's like...

01:07:43.711 --> 01:07:44.930
- OK.

01:07:58.552 --> 01:07:59.945
- What's wrong with the bagel?

01:08:00.293 --> 01:08:01.903
- It's not the same.

01:08:04.558 --> 01:08:05.907
- As what?

01:08:16.004 --> 01:08:17.788
Damn it, Emmett.
Will you just--

01:08:36.328 --> 01:08:37.591
Emmett.

01:08:53.216 --> 01:08:55.479
Emmett, will you
tell me your problem?

01:08:59.309 --> 01:09:01.658
- My problem is
I'm not sure what's real.

01:09:17.196 --> 01:09:18.371
Emmett.

01:09:21.026 --> 01:09:22.593
What's your problem?

01:09:24.072 --> 01:09:28.163
- I'm Emmett
and my problem is,

01:09:28.163 --> 01:09:31.819
is that my girlfriend
and I took mushrooms

01:09:31.819 --> 01:09:36.737
and I seem to be
really upset right now

01:09:36.737 --> 01:09:38.261
about something she did,

01:09:38.261 --> 01:09:41.220
but I'm not going to
say what it is.

01:09:44.397 --> 01:09:46.051
- What do you think she did?

01:09:50.837 --> 01:09:52.404
- I think she was
playing a game.

01:09:56.279 --> 01:09:58.803
I guess it's kind of like a game
of playing right now, but...

01:10:00.457 --> 01:10:02.937
No, in that game, she...

01:10:08.116 --> 01:10:09.901
pretended to be his mother?

01:10:23.610 --> 01:10:24.872
Emm.

01:10:27.788 --> 01:10:29.355
Emm.
- Your turn.

01:10:36.667 --> 01:10:38.016
- OK.

01:10:40.148 --> 01:10:41.411
Hmm.

01:10:44.936 --> 01:10:46.416
I'm Anya.

01:10:49.245 --> 01:10:52.030
My problem is,
is that I I've been trying

01:10:52.030 --> 01:10:54.206
to tell you something
for a while now

01:10:54.206 --> 01:10:56.077
and I have been
too scared to do it.

01:11:00.125 --> 01:11:02.345
I really wanted to
have your child.

01:11:11.832 --> 01:11:13.791
My problem is that I can't.

01:11:35.203 --> 01:11:37.902
- My name is Anya.

01:11:37.902 --> 01:11:41.601
And I want to have a family
but I don't think I can.

01:11:41.601 --> 01:11:43.386
- What do you mean?

01:11:43.386 --> 01:11:44.822
What do you mean?
You don't think you can?

01:11:44.822 --> 01:11:47.781
- Because all I care about
is writing poetry.

01:11:47.781 --> 01:11:50.349
And going to gallery openings
and impressing my friends,

01:11:50.349 --> 01:11:52.612
and basically maintaining
this image of myself

01:11:52.612 --> 01:11:56.877
that is like the opposite
of holding a baby in my arms,

01:11:56.877 --> 01:12:00.011
and being covered
in all that weird puke.

01:12:01.099 --> 01:12:03.275
My mother is this
really cold intellectual type,

01:12:03.275 --> 01:12:05.756
and I never really
got me love from her

01:12:05.756 --> 01:12:07.584
unless I did
something exceptional.

01:12:07.584 --> 01:12:08.759
And you see,
when I was like a kid,

01:12:08.759 --> 01:12:11.544
I was like, really gifted.

01:12:11.544 --> 01:12:13.503
And so I got a lot of love
from her because of that.

01:12:13.503 --> 01:12:14.808
But now that
I'm not seen as like,

01:12:14.808 --> 01:12:17.245
the most amazing poet or like,
even like adult, you know,

01:12:17.245 --> 01:12:19.291
my mom seems to have, you know,

01:12:19.291 --> 01:12:21.511
like, like,
disappeared from my life.

01:12:21.511 --> 01:12:23.251
But I think it's like
in a meaningful way.

01:12:23.251 --> 01:12:25.689
But also, she may think
that I'm just mediocre

01:12:25.689 --> 01:12:29.475
and I'm, like,
kind of broken because of that.

01:12:31.651 --> 01:12:33.392
And I'm just,
I'm just so worried

01:12:33.392 --> 01:12:35.481
that I'm not capable
of giving the kind of love

01:12:35.481 --> 01:12:38.310
that a child or maybe even
a husband would deserve,

01:12:38.310 --> 01:12:39.920
because I can't
think of anything

01:12:39.920 --> 01:12:41.705
beyond my own fucking neuroses.

01:12:41.705 --> 01:12:43.010
Which is why
a couple of months ago,

01:12:43.010 --> 01:12:44.360
I pulled out all my eyebrows

01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:46.449
and I looked like
a fucking mannequin.

01:12:58.852 --> 01:13:00.158
- Did you look at it?

01:13:07.948 --> 01:13:09.733
There's no child in here.

01:13:11.561 --> 01:13:13.171
They never could be
a baby in here

01:13:13.171 --> 01:13:15.086
because I can't have a baby.

01:13:19.786 --> 01:13:22.659
Why aren't you saying anything?
I can't have a baby!

01:13:25.139 --> 01:13:27.272
- I mean, this is what
you said last night.

01:13:31.363 --> 01:13:32.973
I need to
get out of these clothes.

01:13:38.370 --> 01:13:41.591
- "If my body gave me
this need to have a child,

01:13:41.591 --> 01:13:43.506
why can't it make me love him?"

01:13:43.506 --> 01:13:45.595
- You think I wrote that?
- I don't know, did you?

01:13:45.595 --> 01:13:47.118
- That would
actually be impossible

01:13:47.118 --> 01:13:48.206
because I would never do that.

01:13:48.206 --> 01:13:49.425
- But you did do that to me,
Anya.

01:13:49.425 --> 01:13:51.644
- Oh, OK.
I'm gonna show you right now.

01:13:51.644 --> 01:13:52.993
Hmm.

01:13:54.081 --> 01:13:56.257
No. Look, look, look.
Is it the same handwriting?

01:13:56.257 --> 01:13:58.129
- Great, so you admitted
you're pretending.

01:13:58.999 --> 01:14:01.437
- I don't think so.
No, I don't know.

01:14:01.437 --> 01:14:02.873
- You don't think so
or you don't know?

01:14:02.873 --> 01:14:04.135
- I just told you
I can't have a baby.

01:14:04.135 --> 01:14:05.397
- How do I know you're
not fucking with me?

01:14:05.397 --> 01:14:07.268
- About what?
No, of course not.

01:14:07.268 --> 01:14:08.966
- You just said
you were pretending, Anya.

01:14:08.966 --> 01:14:12.317
- Not about that.
- About fucking what?

01:14:12.317 --> 01:14:14.058
About everything?

01:14:14.058 --> 01:14:15.538
- I just told you
I can't have a baby.

01:14:15.538 --> 01:14:17.801
What else do you
want me to tell you?

01:14:17.801 --> 01:14:19.585
- You know what?
I want the fucking truth.

01:14:19.585 --> 01:14:21.195
That's what I want.

01:14:21.500 --> 01:14:23.415
I want the fucking truth.
That's what I fucking want.

01:14:23.415 --> 01:14:24.895
- No, you're not
going to do that.
- I swear to God.

01:14:24.895 --> 01:14:27.332
I swear to God.
I swear to fucking God, Anya.

01:14:27.332 --> 01:14:28.289
- I don't know.

01:14:28.289 --> 01:14:29.377
- You made it up.
- I don't know.

01:14:29.377 --> 01:14:31.336
I don't know.
- That's not a fucking answer.

01:14:31.336 --> 01:14:31.945
It's not an answer, Anya.
- I don't know what I did!

01:14:35.122 --> 01:14:36.646
Emmett.

01:14:36.646 --> 01:14:38.822
Emmett, that is
my only notebook.

01:14:38.822 --> 01:14:40.476
That is two years of my life.

01:14:43.870 --> 01:14:47.526
Emmett, that is my only copy
I will do anything you ask me.

01:14:47.526 --> 01:14:48.875
Just don't do this.

01:14:48.875 --> 01:14:51.225
Emmett.
Emmett, you wouldn't do this!

01:14:52.488 --> 01:14:53.880
Emmett--

01:14:58.798 --> 01:15:00.496
Of course your mother
abandoned you.

01:15:01.801 --> 01:15:03.281
Of course she fucking did!

01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:29.612
Emmett! Emmett!

01:16:39.116 --> 01:16:40.508
Emmett?

01:17:16.501 --> 01:17:18.155
Fuck this.

01:17:39.698 --> 01:17:42.092
Emmett, where are my keys?

01:18:06.377 --> 01:18:07.900
<i>Anya?</i>

01:18:18.737 --> 01:18:20.086
- Emmett.

01:18:43.153 --> 01:18:44.458
Emmett.

01:19:30.330 --> 01:19:31.636
<i>What are you doing?</i>

01:20:34.655 --> 01:20:36.005
- Anya?

01:20:37.484 --> 01:20:38.746
- Who are you?

01:20:38.746 --> 01:20:39.835
- I'm Bill, your neighbor.

01:20:41.314 --> 01:20:43.621
I found him passed out
by the side of the road.

01:20:44.970 --> 01:20:46.363
Let's get him inside.

01:20:49.018 --> 01:20:50.497
There you go.

01:21:36.456 --> 01:21:38.110
You were on your way out?

01:21:41.026 --> 01:21:42.593
Are you going to
take him with you?

01:21:45.813 --> 01:21:47.903
Aren't you trying to
start a family?

01:21:52.864 --> 01:21:54.213
- Is that what he told you?

01:22:08.271 --> 01:22:09.881
- Forgive me.

01:22:12.710 --> 01:22:15.060
I haven't been here
since the day I found her.

01:22:28.247 --> 01:22:30.380
Tracy once told me that

01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:33.165
she was going to
be reincarnated as a bug,

01:22:33.165 --> 01:22:35.646
because of all the
terrible things she did.

01:22:37.778 --> 01:22:40.042
Still can't bring myself
to kill one.

01:22:44.046 --> 01:22:46.962
We tried it once.
Me and her.

01:22:51.401 --> 01:22:53.229
I could never get over her.

01:22:54.317 --> 01:22:56.972
Hard as I try, I just can't
accept the fact that...

01:23:00.627 --> 01:23:02.020
it's all gone.

01:23:06.851 --> 01:23:08.374
- She's still here.

01:23:11.421 --> 01:23:12.813
- Jeez!
- Are you OK?

01:23:12.813 --> 01:23:14.641
- I'm fine, I'm fine.

01:23:21.648 --> 01:23:23.302
- What happened?

01:23:26.827 --> 01:23:28.742
- Emmett was a difficult child.

01:23:29.656 --> 01:23:31.702
A wild child.

01:23:31.702 --> 01:23:33.312
Hard to discipline.

01:23:36.011 --> 01:23:37.360
- The syringe?

01:23:39.318 --> 01:23:43.540
- He showed up at my house,
filthy, scared.

01:23:43.540 --> 01:23:46.282
His foot was broken.
I took him to the hospital

01:23:46.282 --> 01:23:48.197
and that's the last night
she saw him.

01:24:01.427 --> 01:24:04.474
What he needs,
you could never give him.

01:24:08.956 --> 01:24:10.697
- He needs her.

01:24:18.270 --> 01:24:20.142
What does she need?

01:24:23.406 --> 01:24:25.060
- I wish I knew.

01:24:32.415 --> 01:24:33.764
Thanks.

01:24:36.071 --> 01:24:37.681
- For what?

01:24:43.295 --> 01:24:45.471
- For letting me say goodbye.

01:26:34.798 --> 01:26:36.495
- <i>What are you doing here?</i><i>
Get out.</i>

01:27:03.653 --> 01:27:05.176
- Do it.

01:27:07.396 --> 01:27:08.962
Do it.

01:27:20.191 --> 01:27:21.366
Do it.

01:28:44.493 --> 01:28:46.538
- You were right.

01:28:46.538 --> 01:28:48.061
About everything.

01:28:53.415 --> 01:28:55.460
I'm sorry about last night.

01:28:58.768 --> 01:29:00.770
I really do feel
a lot better now.

01:29:04.861 --> 01:29:06.645
I just hope
it's one of those things

01:29:06.645 --> 01:29:10.257
where you can see,
you know, like,

01:29:10.257 --> 01:29:15.175
deep down inside,
even, even my darkest,

01:29:15.175 --> 01:29:18.048
nastiest self and maybe I'm...

01:29:18.048 --> 01:29:19.571
not all bad.

01:29:30.365 --> 01:29:33.193
I guess you didn't look too
closely at which book I burned.

01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:39.722
You know, maybe before
you make any big decisions

01:29:39.722 --> 01:29:42.464
we can spend the day together.

01:29:42.464 --> 01:29:44.422
Get out of this house.

01:29:45.380 --> 01:29:47.947
Enjoy the country before we
have to go back to the city.

01:29:52.735 --> 01:29:56.216
Now that I'm no longer avoidant.

01:30:07.706 --> 01:30:09.360
You wanna talk about
how you're feeling?

01:30:15.888 --> 01:30:17.499
I'm Anya and my problem is--

01:30:17.499 --> 01:30:19.675
- No, don't! Don't. Don't.

01:30:22.112 --> 01:30:23.505
- It's fine.
We're not going to tip.

01:30:30.860 --> 01:30:33.079
- I was relieved
you burned my book.

01:30:35.125 --> 01:30:36.474
I've been
telling people for years

01:30:36.474 --> 01:30:37.910
that it's been coming.

01:30:40.086 --> 01:30:42.088
I was so nervous

01:30:42.698 --> 01:30:44.830
about what everyone would think
when they actually read it.

01:30:45.527 --> 01:30:47.442
Am I a hack?
Am I too shallow?

01:30:47.442 --> 01:30:49.008
Or is it too weird
or pretentious?

01:30:49.008 --> 01:30:51.446
Or am I just pretending to
be something that I'm not?

01:30:54.449 --> 01:30:57.974
I think I wanted
a child just because

01:30:57.974 --> 01:30:59.323
you know, what I was doing
my entire life

01:30:59.323 --> 01:31:01.020
I wasn't even good at.

01:31:01.020 --> 01:31:02.718
It's because I was mediocre.

01:31:02.718 --> 01:31:05.808
I needed something to
feel like my life has meaning.

01:31:14.120 --> 01:31:16.558
When I was young, I spent hours

01:31:16.558 --> 01:31:18.560
and hours outside,

01:31:19.474 --> 01:31:22.825
I'd come home and she would be
writing or dancing

01:31:22.825 --> 01:31:24.870
and she would say
things to me like, "Not now."

01:31:26.829 --> 01:31:28.570
You know, "Go away. Not now."

01:31:28.570 --> 01:31:30.180
"Can't you see,
I'm in the middle of something?"

01:31:30.180 --> 01:31:32.443
I was hungry, you know,

01:31:32.443 --> 01:31:35.359
or cold or tired or--

01:31:35.359 --> 01:31:37.013
- You were needy.
- Exactly. I was needy.

01:31:37.013 --> 01:31:38.797
I needed my fucking mom.

01:31:40.886 --> 01:31:43.498
I mean, if my existence

01:31:43.498 --> 01:31:45.369
was just going to
be some constant reminder

01:31:45.369 --> 01:31:46.675
of a life
that she left behind,

01:31:46.675 --> 01:31:48.981
why put us both through that?

01:31:48.981 --> 01:31:50.592
- She tried to make it work.

01:31:52.898 --> 01:31:54.291
She really tried.

01:31:54.291 --> 01:31:56.336
- She fucking abandoned me.

01:31:56.336 --> 01:31:58.643
- No, she did.

01:31:58.643 --> 01:32:00.253
They took you from her.

01:32:03.779 --> 01:32:05.607
I found the records
in the basement.

01:32:15.268 --> 01:32:16.748
- How did you do it?

01:32:21.840 --> 01:32:24.147
- You talked like her.
You moved like her.

01:32:25.235 --> 01:32:27.716
You danced. You cooked.

01:32:27.716 --> 01:32:29.152
You cleaned.

01:32:29.152 --> 01:32:30.762
You changed your handwriting.

01:32:37.682 --> 01:32:39.031
How?

01:32:59.399 --> 01:33:01.271
Are you my mother?

01:33:05.057 --> 01:33:06.798
- No.

01:33:07.669 --> 01:33:09.540
- Are you sure?

01:33:09.540 --> 01:33:10.889
- Yes.

01:33:14.458 --> 01:33:16.025
- Are you Anya?

01:33:19.245 --> 01:33:20.769
- Yes.

01:33:21.944 --> 01:33:23.249
- Are you sure?

01:33:25.295 --> 01:33:27.166
- Yes. Yes.

01:33:32.084 --> 01:33:33.608
- But.

01:33:34.609 --> 01:33:35.958
- What?

01:33:38.569 --> 01:33:40.615
- But Anya can't swim.

01:34:35.713 --> 01:34:37.062
- Anya?

01:36:11.809 --> 01:36:13.898
- Hi. I'm Anya.

01:36:17.859 --> 01:36:19.469
My problem is

01:36:22.820 --> 01:36:24.343
I need a child.

01:36:44.233 --> 01:36:45.887
- My name's Emmett

01:36:48.890 --> 01:36:50.805
and my problem is

01:36:55.461 --> 01:36:57.115
I need a mother.
