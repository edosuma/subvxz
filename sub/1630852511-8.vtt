07:57.945 --> 07:59.444
<i> - What kind of a scenario</i>
<i> are we looking at?</i>

07:59.513 --> 08:01.179
- We want them to be scared.

08:01.248 --> 08:03.215
So it's kind of gonna be
like a prank,

08:03.283 --> 08:05.917
but also like
a really fun event.

08:05.986 --> 08:09.020
<i> - Do you want it</i>
<i> to be like a murder?</i>

08:09.089 --> 08:10.222
<i> They witness it.</i>

08:10.290 --> 08:12.123
<i> We mess with them</i>
<i> as if it's real</i>

08:12.192 --> 08:14.459
<i> and kind of get them</i>
<i> answering questions</i>

08:14.528 --> 08:17.362
<i> as a detective followed by...</i>
- [softly] That's great.

08:17.431 --> 08:19.164
<i> - Then they realize</i>
<i> it's a murder mystery.</i>

08:19.233 --> 08:21.900
<i> And we then play</i>
<i> that as a game.</i>

08:21.969 --> 08:23.535
- That would be good.
- We're by water.

08:23.604 --> 08:25.036
We're by a pool.

08:25.105 --> 08:27.272
So I don't know
if maybe there's a way

08:27.341 --> 08:28.907
you could
kind of work that in there.

08:28.976 --> 08:30.475
<i> - Maybe on the way</i>
<i> to your dinner,</i>

08:30.544 --> 08:33.078
<i> you find</i>
<i> a dead body in the pool.</i>

08:33.146 --> 08:35.413
- Oh, wow. That is an ambush.

08:35.482 --> 08:36.681
- Mm. I like it. I love it.

08:36.750 --> 08:37.849
- I think this might be

08:37.918 --> 08:39.784
one of my favorite events
I ever planned.

08:39.853 --> 08:41.319
<i> - Text me at this number</i>

08:41.388 --> 08:44.055
<i> with the specific location,</i>
<i> time, and all that.</i>

08:44.124 --> 08:45.457
- Yeah. For sure.
<i> - And we'll make this happen.</i>

08:45.526 --> 08:47.225
- All right.
That sounds amazing.

08:47.294 --> 08:48.493
- This is gonna prank everyone.

08:48.562 --> 08:50.228
I think everyone's
gonna be so surprised.

08:50.297 --> 08:51.263
- All right.
<i> - Looking forward to it.</i>

08:51.331 --> 08:52.531
- We are looking forward
to it too.

08:52.599 --> 08:53.765
This is gonna be awesome.

08:53.834 --> 08:55.233
- Thanks so much.
- Thank you.

08:55.302 --> 08:57.402
- They're gonna be like,
oh, [bleep].

08:57.471 --> 08:59.004
- We just saw a murder.

08:59.072 --> 09:01.172
- It's gonna be [bleep] great.
It's gonna be like a fun night,

09:01.241 --> 09:03.742
but also I become
the prank war champion.

09:03.810 --> 09:06.545
Prank war champion.

09:06.613 --> 09:08.914
Take it, Pauly.
I'm coming for you.

09:08.982 --> 09:10.048
- You're gonna leave me.

09:10.117 --> 09:12.117
- I didn't see it.
[laughs]

09:12.185 --> 09:13.952
- That was so awkward
and terrible.

09:14.021 --> 09:15.287
Oh, my God.

10:01.301 --> 10:02.534
They're not [bleep]

10:06.239 --> 10:08.940

in their same clothes.

10:09.009 --> 10:11.676

- No.

10:11.745 --> 10:14.045

10:14.114 --> 10:17.115
but I only have like new stuff
that I kind of want back.

10:17.184 --> 10:18.683

I'm leaving. I don't care.

I'm getting [bleep] right now.
You can stay here.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.295
I'm gonna have
a [bleep] breakdown.

10:30.364 --> 10:32.197

that Angelina and Chris

10:32.265 --> 10:33.932
were gonna make it
to that stage

10:34.001 --> 10:36.534
where they sort of rekindled
that romance.

10:36.603 --> 10:38.403
- Because they broke that seal.
- That's what we said.

10:38.472 --> 10:39.771
- Get up.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.539
We gotta go to--I gotta go

No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

I'm not [bleep] doing this!

10:54.287 --> 10:55.687

- No!

10:55.756 --> 10:57.188
- I'm relieved for them

10:57.257 --> 10:59.724
because I wasn't sure how
they were gonna arrive here.

10:59.793 --> 11:00.925
- Uh-huh.

11:00.994 --> 11:02.193
- And I feel like
they're a little calmer.

11:02.262 --> 11:04.062
- I'm not wearing
the same clothes all day.

11:04.131 --> 11:05.597

- Yeah.

11:05.666 --> 11:07.132

All that built-up tension

11:07.200 --> 11:08.500

11:08.568 --> 11:10.301
- They're playing
[bleep] games with me.

11:15.342 --> 11:18.376

I don't give a [bleep].

11:18.445 --> 11:21.546

I'm here!

11:21.615 --> 11:24.516

the megaphone to the Keys.

11:24.584 --> 11:27.652

11:27.721 --> 11:29.254

11:29.322 --> 11:30.488

11:30.557 --> 11:32.457

Do you see it?

11:32.526 --> 11:34.559

11:34.628 --> 11:36.628

11:40.767 --> 11:42.033

I'm not wearing
the same clothes all day.

11:43.870 --> 11:45.370
I wanna go home.

11:45.439 --> 11:47.138
Why don't you wear the [bleep]
same underwear today

11:47.207 --> 11:48.907
and tomorrow,
see how you feel.

11:50.510 --> 11:52.377
- Is Angelina and Chris
coming out?

11:52.446 --> 11:54.546
- I called her
this morning at nine...

11:54.614 --> 11:55.880
- Well, that's when...

11:55.949 --> 11:57.582
- To give her stuff
and she just didn't pick up.

11:57.651 --> 11:59.317
<i> - I kind of feel bad</i>
<i> for Angelina</i>

11:59.386 --> 12:01.953
because the reason
why she couldn't get her bags

12:02.022 --> 12:05.990
on the plane is because
Mike brought seven suitcases.

12:06.059 --> 12:09.227
But also chaos
just follows Angelina.

12:09.296 --> 12:11.329
<i> You can't write this [bleep].</i>

12:11.398 --> 12:12.797

12:12.866 --> 12:16.701
there's a Walgreens
2.7 miles away, Frank.

12:16.770 --> 12:17.936
I'm [bleep] pissed off.

12:18.004 --> 12:20.905
I'm so mad at you,
Michael and Lauren.

12:20.974 --> 12:22.841
- Yeah, I can't wait
to see Pauly.

12:22.909 --> 12:26.111
I love his energy.
It's so positive and--

12:26.179 --> 12:27.679
- Just like Angelina.

12:27.748 --> 12:29.047
- [laughs]
It's quite the opposite.

12:29.116 --> 12:30.115
It's quite the opposite.

12:30.183 --> 12:31.983
- I got tiddy sweat.

12:33.887 --> 12:37.155
They probably have disposable
underwear at [bleep] Walgreens.

12:37.224 --> 12:39.491
There's probably [bleep]
leggings at Walgreens, Frank.

12:44.464 --> 12:46.197
- Oh, wait, this is Ang.
Hold on.

12:46.266 --> 12:47.832
[laughter]
[phone ringing]

12:47.901 --> 12:49.167

<i> [bleep] five minutes away.</i>

12:54.374 --> 12:57.108
<i> - I have no idea</i>
<i> why Angeliner is so upset.</i>

12:57.177 --> 13:00.478
I'm missing two out
of the seven of my bags.

13:00.547 --> 13:03.515
Do you see me flipping out?
No.

13:03.583 --> 13:05.917
- Ang, what you need
is a bathing suit.

13:05.986 --> 13:07.986
I have a bathing suit.
Meet me in my room

13:08.054 --> 13:09.721
and then we will have
some drinks, relax...

13:09.790 --> 13:10.989
- All right, cool.

13:11.057 --> 13:12.090
<i> - By the time</i>
<i> we're done doing that,</i>

13:12.159 --> 13:13.925
your bags will be here
for tonight.

13:13.994 --> 13:15.160
- You need shorts? Oh, yeah.

13:15.228 --> 13:16.795
He definitely needs shorts.
He's got nothing.

13:16.863 --> 13:18.963
- Do you have a bathing suit
for Chris or shorts?

13:19.032 --> 13:20.665
- I have an outfit
just for him. Yeah.

13:20.734 --> 13:21.866
- Okay.
<i> - All right. Bye.</i>

13:21.935 --> 13:23.301
- All right, bye.

13:23.370 --> 13:25.637
It seems like a lot of times
I'm able to put out

13:25.705 --> 13:26.738
Angelina fires.

13:26.807 --> 13:28.706
Calm down. Come here.
- Thank you.

13:28.775 --> 13:31.209
- Come here and loosen up.
Okay.

13:31.278 --> 13:32.977
- You're my savior.

13:34.181 --> 13:36.781

a pair of shorts.

13:36.850 --> 13:38.316

13:38.385 --> 13:39.450
- Another pair of socks.

13:39.519 --> 13:40.885
- I have some stuff.

13:40.954 --> 13:42.654
- I hate living like this.
I hate to be a pain for you.

13:42.722 --> 13:44.756

the perfect outfit for you.

13:44.825 --> 13:45.757

13:45.826 --> 13:47.125

have been

13:47.194 --> 13:49.093
really starting to get it in.

13:50.163 --> 13:51.930

13:53.266 --> 13:56.334
The leather did not work
for Mr. and Mrs. Situation,

13:56.403 --> 13:59.704

your own bocce ball?

14:44.317 --> 14:46.451
No wonder you had 12 suitcases.

14:46.519 --> 14:50.121

14:50.190 --> 14:52.790
It got me through all
the tough times in Otisville.

the warden to let me go home

checked out, though.

15:31.231 --> 15:32.263
- I should. I should.

15:32.332 --> 15:33.831

teams?

15:33.900 --> 15:35.066
- You're the pro.

15:35.135 --> 15:36.901
- We can do me and Chris
since we're a couple now.

15:36.970 --> 15:38.403

I'll be with you.

15:38.471 --> 15:40.271

All right.

your team name, boys?

15:42.542 --> 15:43.675
Do you want to think
of that--

15:43.743 --> 15:45.043

- Just the Betas.

15:45.111 --> 15:47.845
<i> [dramatic music]</i>

15:47.914 --> 15:49.514
- You could just
call us Team Alpha.

15:51.518 --> 15:53.184
- Size don't matter
in this game, baby.

15:53.253 --> 15:54.786
- Oh, wow.
- Wow.

15:54.854 --> 15:57.889
- So bocce bowl is a game where
you're in, like, a big sandbox.

15:57.958 --> 15:59.924
- Mike,
where's the sweet spot here?

15:59.993 --> 16:03.294
- Technically in the yard.
We'd like to go to the corner.

16:03.363 --> 16:05.964
<i> - Each team has to get</i>
<i> their color bocce ball</i>

16:06.032 --> 16:09.133
as close to the little
white ball as possible.

16:09.202 --> 16:10.935
- Mike, were you guys playing
for, like, bragging rights?

16:11.004 --> 16:13.037
- Bragging rights was
everything in the yard.

16:13.106 --> 16:14.505
- Mike keeps talking
about the yard.

16:14.574 --> 16:16.374
- This is how we played
in the yard. Okay?

16:16.443 --> 16:17.709
This is how we played
in the yard.

16:17.777 --> 16:18.943
You guys are not ready.

16:19.012 --> 16:21.245
- I don't know how hard
the yard was.

16:21.314 --> 16:23.414
- So if you was
a bocce ball champion,

16:23.483 --> 16:25.650
you got extra helpings
on the chow line.

16:25.719 --> 16:28.119
- He went to basically a camp.

16:28.188 --> 16:29.487
- So you were playing for food?

16:29.556 --> 16:30.588
- Yes.
- Nice.

16:30.657 --> 16:33.358
- With tech guys
that hacked somebody.

16:33.426 --> 16:34.959
- This is how we played
in prison, baby.

16:35.028 --> 16:36.327
- This is how we played
in prison.

16:36.396 --> 16:38.730

- Extra macro, kid.

16:38.798 --> 16:40.365

the non-alphas.

- All right. Let's see.

17:46.166 --> 17:47.598

17:47.667 --> 17:49.133
- I don't think
it's spicy though.

17:52.639 --> 17:55.173
- No, that's
a regular margarita.

a different spicy marg?

This isn't really spicy.
That's it.

Should we clear that, or...

18:32.212 --> 18:33.478
- I think we should clear it.

18:33.546 --> 18:34.846
- Just like a beta to take away

18:34.914 --> 18:36.581
any obstacle
in their path anyway.

18:36.649 --> 18:39.383
- When we see obstacles,
we see opportunity.

18:39.452 --> 18:40.418
- That's right.

18:40.487 --> 18:41.586

I call you guys?

18:41.654 --> 18:42.920
Big for nothing.

18:42.989 --> 18:45.823

alphas being athletes?

19:16.456 --> 19:18.556
- Okay. Okay.

19:18.625 --> 19:21.292

So the reason why I did a snap.

19:21.361 --> 19:22.527
- Yeah.

19:22.595 --> 19:25.663
- Because--so my parents
have a house in Boca.

19:25.732 --> 19:27.365
They were members
of the Boca Resort,

19:27.433 --> 19:31.102
which is like a very fancy,
like, Waldorf historic thing.

19:31.171 --> 19:34.038
And anytime you want whatever,
you just get someone

19:34.107 --> 19:36.174
and they come
bring you everything.

19:36.242 --> 19:37.475
- I wasn't prepared
for the snap.

19:37.544 --> 19:38.643
- I know.
- I was like, whoa.

19:38.711 --> 19:40.011
- Like, they'll come.

19:40.079 --> 19:42.280
- Hands down,

19:42.348 --> 19:44.982
Lauren is the bougiest
out of the three of us.

19:45.051 --> 19:48.352
I would go second,
but nobody tops Lauren.

- No, you are.
- I don't know.

19:59.532 --> 20:01.432
I might get Lauren attack again
from last night.

20:01.501 --> 20:03.601

We gotta nail the betas.

'cause if the green--if I go...

20:08.708 --> 20:09.941

Lock the door.

sex isn't the answer.

both: For them.

- Yeah.

31:55.848 --> 31:59.416

a little bit of a theory.

31:59.485 --> 32:01.451
Now, Angeliners--

32:01.520 --> 32:03.353
they've been boasting that

32:03.422 --> 32:05.355
they have finally
had sex after two years.

32:05.424 --> 32:08.292

that we already had sex.

32:13.165 --> 32:15.132

I said, what position?

32:15.200 --> 32:16.733
They couldn't answer
that question.

32:16.802 --> 32:20.904
If you can't answer
what position after two years,

32:20.973 --> 32:22.439
it wasn't a big thing.

32:22.508 --> 32:24.341
Maybe it wasn't a thing at all.
