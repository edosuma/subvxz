WEBVTT

00:29.725 --> 00:32.336
WITCH: Come, children,
and listen,

00:32.380 --> 00:36.471
for the story I tell
holds a lesson.

00:36.514 --> 00:39.952
A lesson that might one day
keep you safe.

00:39.996 --> 00:44.218
So, gather in close
and hear me well.

00:44.261 --> 00:47.873
It's the story
of the Beautiful Child

00:47.917 --> 00:48.831
with the little pink cap.

00:51.834 --> 00:55.359
Her birth was a gift
to her mother and father

00:55.403 --> 00:57.535
in a time of great suffering and famine.

00:59.015 --> 01:00.538
All in the village agreed

01:00.582 --> 01:02.758
she was
the most beautiful child.

01:05.978 --> 01:08.242
But an illness fell upon her,

01:08.938 --> 01:10.244
and it was predicted

01:10.287 --> 01:12.681
that her first winter
would be her last.

01:15.075 --> 01:18.252
Her father was not one to take such tidings passively,

01:19.862 --> 01:23.431
and whispers
told of an enchantress

01:23.474 --> 01:27.522
with the power
to cure any ailment.

01:27.565 --> 01:32.048
All that was required was for her father to be brave

01:32.092 --> 01:34.311
and to trust the darkness.

01:39.925 --> 01:41.275
And he was,

01:42.014 --> 01:43.146
and he did.

01:46.106 --> 01:49.544
But when that enchantress
took away the illness,

01:49.587 --> 01:52.112
she left in its place a gift.

01:54.505 --> 01:59.597
It came to be that the child had been granted Second Sight.

01:59.641 --> 02:02.165
Everyone thought they wanted her to read their futures,

02:03.949 --> 02:07.649
but then no one wanted to hear what she saw.

02:08.650 --> 02:10.347
For it is only the bitter end

02:10.391 --> 02:13.176
that comes for everyone,
anyway.

02:13.220 --> 02:16.788
And she herself
made sure of that.

02:16.832 --> 02:18.442
For it was soon clear...

02:22.968 --> 02:26.320
...that she was powerful
in other ways, too.

02:30.280 --> 02:32.239
It seemed
she would spare no one.

02:34.415 --> 02:36.156
Not even her own father,

02:38.506 --> 02:40.769
who, for her,
had sacrificed so much.

02:46.731 --> 02:49.647
And so, it was ordered

02:49.691 --> 02:53.564
that the child be returned to the darkness that made her.

02:55.305 --> 02:58.569
She was hidden away,
deep in the woods,

02:58.613 --> 03:01.006
all alone,

03:01.050 --> 03:03.183
with no one to play with.

03:04.314 --> 03:08.405
But still, she had her own way

03:09.319 --> 03:11.495
of making friends.

03:17.545 --> 03:21.418
So, children, please,
beware of gifts.

03:22.898 --> 03:26.336
Beware of those
that offer them.

03:26.380 --> 03:30.427
And beware of those who are only too happy to take them.

04:04.244 --> 04:05.506
GRETEL: Fairy tales have a funny way

04:05.549 --> 04:06.507
of getting into your head.

04:08.552 --> 04:11.555
I don't remember where I was, or when,

04:11.599 --> 04:12.991
that I first heard the story

04:13.035 --> 04:14.689
of the Beautiful Child
in her little pink cap.

04:16.430 --> 04:17.909
Just feels like
I've always known it.

04:19.171 --> 04:20.564
I wonder how someone gets

04:20.608 --> 04:22.349
their own fairy tale
told about them.

04:23.698 --> 04:25.134
And if I'd even want that.

04:26.831 --> 04:29.138
You have to go through
a lot of terrible trouble.

04:29.181 --> 04:30.705
Then most the time,
some prince appears

04:30.748 --> 04:31.923
and wakes you up anyway.

04:33.751 --> 04:36.450
But I don't see
any princes around here.

04:36.493 --> 04:37.886
There's only
my little brother.

04:39.235 --> 04:41.455
He follows me wherever I go,

04:41.498 --> 04:42.978
and I have to share
everything with him.

04:45.154 --> 04:46.764
But at least he's mine.

04:46.808 --> 04:48.244
Why are you wearing that?

04:50.725 --> 04:52.770
I'm going to meet
with John Stripp.

04:52.814 --> 04:55.556
And his wife, if he has one.

04:55.599 --> 04:56.905
Mother imagines
he needs a housekeeper.

04:58.341 --> 05:01.518
But why are your lips
so strangely colored?

05:11.659 --> 05:12.660
Okay.

05:14.270 --> 05:16.490
If I should ever see
so much as a crumb of cake,

05:16.533 --> 05:17.578
you'll be the first to know.

05:18.579 --> 05:20.015
Okay?

05:35.639 --> 05:36.336
MASTER STRIPP: Do you read?

05:40.078 --> 05:44.344
Uh... No. Though,
I am able to bake and launder.

05:44.387 --> 05:46.520
Your father was a farmer, yes?

05:46.563 --> 05:47.782
GRETEL: Was, yes.

05:47.825 --> 05:49.610
He's gone ahead to his reward.

05:51.176 --> 05:54.223
Uh, Mother's alone now,
and does what she can.

05:54.266 --> 05:56.138
I should think
she can do precious little

05:56.181 --> 05:59.576
till this terrible pestilence
is lifted.

05:59.620 --> 06:01.665
Some say the lands are cursed.

06:01.709 --> 06:03.537
MASTER STRIPP: Only with
the incompetence of men,

06:04.625 --> 06:07.323
as so much of everything is.

06:07.367 --> 06:10.065
And really, it's the whole
system that's so absurd.

06:10.108 --> 06:12.241
I mean, senselessly,
we owe crop to some bishop,

06:12.284 --> 06:14.417
and we're not even permitted
to feed our own...

06:17.594 --> 06:19.988
You will do well to limit
the number of words

06:20.031 --> 06:20.902
that come out of your mouth.

06:24.296 --> 06:25.863
Yes, sir.

06:25.907 --> 06:29.432
Do something nice for
a poor, old man, won't you?

06:31.260 --> 06:33.741
Try saying "milord" instead.

06:37.701 --> 06:38.572
Yes...

06:39.877 --> 06:41.096
milord.

06:41.139 --> 06:43.707
That's a good girl.

06:43.751 --> 06:45.579
I think you'll find
our guests will prefer it.

06:47.537 --> 06:49.278
Now, I have something
to ask you.

06:50.758 --> 06:52.629
Have you kept your maidenhood?

06:54.109 --> 06:55.415
I beg your pardon?

06:55.458 --> 06:57.329
You may beg all you want,

06:58.156 --> 07:00.811
but my question remains.

07:00.855 --> 07:02.334
Are you...

07:04.162 --> 07:05.555
intact?

07:14.042 --> 07:16.740
GRETEL: What if I had reached
across and slapped him?

07:16.784 --> 07:18.438
Would my palm
have stung with pride?

07:19.613 --> 07:20.657
Would I have felt nothing?

07:22.790 --> 07:25.445
MOTHER: Would it have killed
you to smile at the man?

07:25.488 --> 07:26.924
To just say "thank you"?

07:29.753 --> 07:31.146
He didn't need a housekeeper.

07:34.366 --> 07:35.803
You can't stay here, Gretel.

07:36.717 --> 07:37.718
GRETEL: Why not?

07:39.589 --> 07:40.895
Because there isn't
enough room.

07:42.505 --> 07:44.725
This place is too crowded
with ghosts.

07:46.422 --> 07:48.076
Hungry ghosts,

07:49.381 --> 07:51.035
of everything now gone.

07:53.560 --> 07:55.083
Your father's
sits right there.

07:57.825 --> 07:59.609
And mine will be here
soon enough.

08:02.394 --> 08:03.874
You shouldn't talk like that.

08:03.918 --> 08:06.703
You'll take your brother,
and make haste to the convent.

08:06.747 --> 08:08.966
Throw yourself
at the boots of the sisters,

08:09.010 --> 08:10.794
and pray they take you in.

08:10.838 --> 08:13.710
Hansel will never be offered
admittance at a convent.

08:16.060 --> 08:18.541
And I would never ask
to be admitted.

08:18.585 --> 08:20.587
Then the two of you
can start work

08:20.630 --> 08:22.589
digging your sweet,
little graves.

08:30.161 --> 08:31.162
Gretel.

08:35.776 --> 08:37.560
When you and your brother
take up your shovels...

08:40.868 --> 08:42.217
dig a hole for Mommy, too.

09:04.587 --> 09:06.458
Be gone!

09:09.549 --> 09:13.465
Or I'll hack you into tiny,
little pieces.

09:19.036 --> 09:20.690
GRETEL: I pulled my brother
from his bed,

09:20.734 --> 09:23.563
and together, we fled the only home we'd ever known.

09:23.606 --> 09:25.652
The door slammed at our backs,

09:25.695 --> 09:27.741
and the big, bad world
opened up in front of us...

09:28.872 --> 09:30.178
like a terrible mouth.

09:32.746 --> 09:36.184
Hmm. You ought to have gone
with the man in the house.

09:36.227 --> 09:37.446
Quiet about things
you don't know.

09:37.489 --> 09:38.882
Why do you always do that?

09:38.926 --> 09:41.276
I don't always do anything.
I'm not a clock.

09:41.319 --> 09:42.843
You make trouble.

09:42.886 --> 09:44.845
You would've had
your own room.

09:44.888 --> 09:47.499
You would've seen a crumb
of cake sooner or later.

09:49.980 --> 09:51.460
Nothing is given
without something else

09:51.503 --> 09:52.635
being taken away.

09:56.465 --> 09:57.988
When can we go back to Mother?

10:03.559 --> 10:05.082
Remember the widow, Hayes,

10:05.126 --> 10:07.519
who used to give Father eggs
before her chickens got sick?

10:07.563 --> 10:08.825
She lives just up ahead.

10:10.261 --> 10:11.828
Perhaps she can give us a bed.

10:14.135 --> 10:15.397
How do your eyes see that far?

10:17.355 --> 10:19.488
I don't have to see things
to know that they're there.

10:24.362 --> 10:25.668
HANSEL: Are you sure
a woman lives here?

10:27.539 --> 10:29.063
GRETEL: I'm sure a woman
used to live here.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.286
HANSEL: Doesn't smell
like a woman lives here.

10:35.330 --> 10:36.679
GRETEL: Quiet.

10:36.723 --> 10:38.550
And be glad for the roof
over our heads.

10:46.384 --> 10:48.038
Well, not exactly
an iron maiden.

10:48.909 --> 10:49.649
Come on, then.

11:02.749 --> 11:04.054
HANSEL: You think
Mother's all right?

11:06.796 --> 11:07.579
GRETEL:
I think she's all right

11:07.623 --> 11:08.668
as long as we're all right.

11:10.800 --> 11:11.758
Gretel,

11:13.368 --> 11:15.239
will we be all right?

11:18.416 --> 11:19.722
If I've got a voice
in the matter.

11:45.182 --> 11:46.183
Brother!

11:49.186 --> 11:52.755
HANSEL: Gretel! Help!
Get it off me!

11:52.799 --> 11:54.278
-GRETEL: Hey!

12:03.070 --> 12:04.071
Oh, but not really.

12:28.312 --> 12:30.488
THE HUNTER: You've been turned
out of your home, I'll wager.

12:30.532 --> 12:32.055
Set out to fend for yourselves

12:32.099 --> 12:34.101
with only your clothes
and your hides,

12:34.144 --> 12:35.537
which aren't much.

12:35.580 --> 12:36.799
HANSEL: I have an axe.

12:38.018 --> 12:40.194
Oh.

12:40.237 --> 12:42.762
I must say, it hides very well
in your shadow, young man.

12:44.764 --> 12:47.288
I mean I have an axe at home.

12:47.331 --> 12:48.768
Be quiet.

12:48.811 --> 12:50.857
THE HUNTER: I'll be happy
to direct you to foresters.

12:50.900 --> 12:52.032
Good people.

12:52.075 --> 12:54.817
Plentiful coin.
Food, if you can earn it.

12:56.123 --> 12:58.125
They will hand you a new axe,

12:58.168 --> 13:00.214
and show you
how to make it work like one.

13:01.215 --> 13:03.826
You, girl,

13:03.870 --> 13:06.350
will learn the ways
of the herbs and the earth.

13:06.394 --> 13:09.353
Lest the men of the world find
a more obvious use for you.

13:15.403 --> 13:17.797
Pray, sir, what might we offer
you in return for the meal?

13:19.320 --> 13:21.801
I mean, you would've eaten it
if not for us.

13:21.844 --> 13:23.715
I don't have
a taste for rabbit.

13:23.759 --> 13:25.717
What do you
want from us, then?

13:25.761 --> 13:27.676
You have nothing
I need or want.

13:29.112 --> 13:31.027
"For kindness
is its own reward.

13:31.071 --> 13:33.769
"But cruelty
is a self-inflicted wound.

13:33.813 --> 13:36.119
"The wicked earn a living
by deception,

13:36.163 --> 13:38.034
"but the one who plants
righteousness

13:38.078 --> 13:39.906
"gathers a true harvest.

13:39.949 --> 13:41.821
"Indeed, those who do
what is right

13:41.864 --> 13:43.126
"will live a good life.

13:43.170 --> 13:46.216
"Those who pursue evil
will die."

13:48.001 --> 13:49.741
But everyone dies.

13:49.785 --> 13:51.613
Indeed. But not right now.

13:54.746 --> 13:55.878
Take your fill, and perhaps

13:55.922 --> 13:58.054
you'll allow me
to draw you each a bath.

13:58.098 --> 13:59.795
The boy here is so filthy,

13:59.839 --> 14:00.927
he could pass for compost

14:00.970 --> 14:02.450
if it not for the whites
in his eyes.

14:16.551 --> 14:17.900
GRETEL: Is it safe
to trust someone

14:17.944 --> 14:19.162
who appears exactly
when you need them?

14:21.034 --> 14:23.514
Or does it feel too much like they've been lying in wait,

14:23.558 --> 14:24.733
coiled like a serpent?

14:31.000 --> 14:33.873
THE HUNTER: Keep west
for two full days and nights.

14:33.916 --> 14:35.787
Keep to the path
I've drawn for you,

14:36.963 --> 14:39.139
and you'll find
what you're looking for.

14:39.182 --> 14:41.750
Stray from it, and you can
expect to meet wolves.

14:41.793 --> 14:44.013
And if you do,
don't stop to talk to them.

14:45.145 --> 14:46.537
They're very charming
and handsome,

14:46.581 --> 14:47.974
but make terrible
conversation.

15:14.304 --> 15:15.479
HANSEL: Why couldn't we stay

15:15.523 --> 15:16.480
where we were
with the huntsman?

15:17.960 --> 15:19.179
GRETEL:
If he'd wanted children,

15:19.222 --> 15:20.615
I suspect he would've made
some of his own.

15:22.008 --> 15:25.141
HANSEL: "Made" them?
Out of what?

15:25.185 --> 15:27.013
Must I explain
all of everything?

15:28.623 --> 15:31.234
HANSEL:
But Mother didn't make us.

15:31.278 --> 15:33.367
We was brought in
through her window by birds.

15:34.716 --> 15:35.891
You're right, Hansel.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.545
What a fool I've been
all this time.

15:39.634 --> 15:40.809
All finished?

15:40.852 --> 15:43.899
Yes, and I'm still hungry.

15:43.943 --> 15:45.857
Only the natural result
of eating so much.

15:47.555 --> 15:48.556
Oh.

15:50.950 --> 15:52.647
Do you remember Father
very much?

15:54.562 --> 15:55.998
No, not very much.

15:58.740 --> 16:01.134
Tell me the fairy tale again.

16:01.177 --> 16:02.483
The one about
the Beautiful Child

16:02.526 --> 16:03.571
with the little pink--

16:03.614 --> 16:04.964
Not right now.

16:06.704 --> 16:08.010
It's too scary,
and you'll start

16:08.054 --> 16:09.403
seeing things
that aren't there.

16:14.886 --> 16:16.192
Some things that probably are.

16:17.498 --> 16:19.717
It isn't scary for me.

16:19.761 --> 16:21.676
And it helps me go to bed.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.997
Gretel, I'm scared.

16:52.489 --> 16:54.187
GRETEL:  There's
nothing and nobody out there.

17:07.983 --> 17:08.679
BEAUTIFUL CHILD:
Gretel.

17:25.522 --> 17:26.697
GRETEL: I always try
to tell my mother

17:26.741 --> 17:28.786
that I can see things,

17:28.830 --> 17:30.527
like I was dreaming
when I was awake.

17:32.529 --> 17:35.489
But she always told me
to keep it to myself,

17:35.532 --> 17:37.360
and that little girls
should never...

17:46.456 --> 17:47.979
What in hell are you doing?

17:48.023 --> 17:51.113
Practicing for when
we meet the foresters.

17:51.157 --> 17:52.549
And you said "hell."

17:54.943 --> 17:56.423
Hey!

17:56.466 --> 17:59.252
All this practice is making
an unnecessary racket!

18:04.779 --> 18:05.780
I'm sorry.

18:06.650 --> 18:07.521
I'm hungry.

18:09.044 --> 18:10.306
I'm hungrier than you are.

18:12.613 --> 18:13.962
Because you're a pig.

18:14.005 --> 18:16.051
-You're a bigger pig.

18:16.095 --> 18:17.835
You're right. I am.

18:41.642 --> 18:43.339
HANSEL: When do we eat again?

18:47.126 --> 18:48.301
Gretel?

18:52.218 --> 18:54.437
Gretel, I'm starving.

19:11.585 --> 19:13.152
HANSEL: Looks like a mushroom.

19:14.196 --> 19:15.632
GRETEL: Yes.
But they're as different

19:15.676 --> 19:16.546
from one another
as people are.

19:20.246 --> 19:22.204
This one might be unfriendly.

19:22.248 --> 19:23.901
How to tell?

19:23.945 --> 19:25.207
Suppose we might ask them.

19:27.078 --> 19:29.646
Well, anyhow, here we all are

19:29.690 --> 19:31.692
and pleased
to make your acquaintance.

19:31.735 --> 19:34.260
We've been without food
for too long now.

19:34.303 --> 19:37.393
And to be completely frankly
honest and open about it,

19:37.437 --> 19:40.135
we were thinking of,

19:40.179 --> 19:42.529
very seriously,
of supping, well,

19:42.572 --> 19:44.400
on you.

19:44.444 --> 19:47.447
So tell me if you will,
strange little things,

19:47.490 --> 19:49.188
are you kind, or no?

19:55.455 --> 19:58.109
What did it say?

19:58.153 --> 20:01.504
Strange as it might be,
I think she said, "Eat me."

21:15.709 --> 21:17.232
BEAUTIFUL CHILD: Follow me.

21:23.630 --> 21:25.371
Come and find me.

21:29.375 --> 21:31.333
Follow me, sister.

22:07.064 --> 22:08.196
HANSEL: Gretel,

22:08.979 --> 22:10.720
is that there?

22:13.157 --> 22:15.377
GRETEL: If it isn't,
neither are we.

22:19.033 --> 22:20.251
Do you smell that?

22:27.868 --> 22:30.392
Gretel, it smells of cake!

22:35.397 --> 22:36.442
Hey.

22:36.485 --> 22:38.226
HANSEL: Let go of me!

22:38.269 --> 22:40.750
Gretel, it smells of cake,

22:40.794 --> 22:42.709
and I'm unable to resist.

22:47.888 --> 22:50.107
Gretel, I need food.

22:54.285 --> 22:55.286
GRETEL:
Stay where I can see you.

22:55.330 --> 22:57.637
HANSEL: They have a slide.

22:57.680 --> 22:59.116
GRETEL: Yet I don't see
any children.

23:00.596 --> 23:02.381
It also smells of bacon,
you know.

23:08.561 --> 23:10.432
HANSEL: Look in through
the window or something.

23:32.715 --> 23:33.455
Well?

23:34.325 --> 23:35.414
What is there?

23:37.590 --> 23:38.591
Only heaven.

23:42.333 --> 23:43.334
HANSEL: What?

23:51.299 --> 23:53.562
Gretel, look and see!

24:46.310 --> 24:47.486
Hansel.

24:54.014 --> 24:55.145
Brother!

25:27.090 --> 25:30.398
You must be the sister
I've heard so much about.

25:32.487 --> 25:33.793
Careful with that, dear.

25:35.403 --> 25:38.014
I'd hate for you to start
something you can't stop.

25:46.936 --> 25:48.851
We never intended
to steal from you, missus.

25:48.895 --> 25:51.288
"Missus"? Think I'm married?

25:51.332 --> 25:54.465
See you a ball and chain
at my heel?

25:54.509 --> 25:57.773
But tell me how you came to be
in my woods,

25:59.470 --> 26:03.605
and so charmingly
unchaperoned.

26:03.649 --> 26:05.825
Our mother
has come upon hardship.

26:05.868 --> 26:09.045
Usually the first thing
a mother comes upon.

26:09.089 --> 26:10.481
My sister won't go
to the convent.

26:10.960 --> 26:12.396
Be quiet.

26:12.440 --> 26:14.573
WITCH: I very much doubt
that a convent is the place

26:14.616 --> 26:18.489
for a girl with action
in her bones,

26:18.533 --> 26:21.580
even if there's hardly any
meat on those action bones.

26:23.059 --> 26:24.583
Aren't you expecting guests?

26:24.626 --> 26:27.411
Guests?
I'd rather have roaches.

26:34.549 --> 26:35.942
Just checking,

26:35.985 --> 26:37.900
to be sure you're not
crawling with louses

26:37.944 --> 26:40.207
before you put your heads
on any pillows of mine.

26:40.729 --> 26:41.687
Ouch!

26:53.742 --> 26:54.700
You're clean enough.

26:56.702 --> 26:58.617
Now, eat.

26:58.660 --> 27:00.314
And rest.

27:00.357 --> 27:02.229
Beds have already
been made up for you.

27:03.056 --> 27:03.796
Thank you.

27:05.406 --> 27:07.538
But really,

27:07.582 --> 27:09.758
we'll stop briefly
but we must be on our way.

27:10.541 --> 27:11.630
WITCH: Milk,

27:11.673 --> 27:13.849
good for bones.

27:33.042 --> 27:37.743
A hair here, a hair there.

27:54.150 --> 27:59.286
My eyes too big
for my stomach, obviously.

27:59.329 --> 28:02.768
And your mouth is too big
for your mouth, obviously.

29:08.398 --> 29:10.749
BEAUTIFUL CHILD:
My mother, she killed me.

29:12.359 --> 29:15.057
My mother, she ate me.

29:17.059 --> 29:19.801
Oh, what a pretty bird am I.

29:20.628 --> 29:23.370
Oh, what a pretty bird am I.

29:24.632 --> 29:27.896
Oh, what a pretty bird am I.

29:27.940 --> 29:29.202
CHILDREN: No!

29:47.089 --> 29:48.047
WITCH: Your breakfast.

29:51.267 --> 29:54.053
No morning beasts for you,
my pretty?

29:54.096 --> 29:55.619
Oh, no, thank you, ma'am.

29:55.663 --> 29:58.231
She can keep
all the world's vegetables,

29:58.274 --> 30:01.103
while I eat only meat
and grow strong like an ox.

30:02.104 --> 30:04.498
She'll grow strong enough.

30:04.541 --> 30:08.894
Just as the ox, with his
vegetable-made bones,

30:08.937 --> 30:12.723
pulls the cart and the fat man
who sits atop it.

30:20.296 --> 30:23.691
Well, another one
bites the dust.

30:23.734 --> 30:24.823
May I not help you with that?

30:26.346 --> 30:27.738
What's this, dear?

30:27.782 --> 30:30.089
Only to say surely in exchange
for your generosity,

30:30.132 --> 30:31.960
I might offer to be the one

30:32.004 --> 30:33.832
out of the two of us
to get down on the ground.

30:33.875 --> 30:36.791
Now, that's a new idea.

30:36.835 --> 30:37.966
I can bake and launder,

30:38.662 --> 30:40.490
uh, turn down beds,

30:40.534 --> 30:45.278
or tend to any, um, animals
that might need tending.

30:45.321 --> 30:46.757
And I can chop wood.

30:46.801 --> 30:49.325
-He can learn.
-Well, I could.

30:49.369 --> 30:52.372
Typically I'm not in the habit
of employing children,

30:52.415 --> 30:55.723
but in this case
it does seem a fair trade.

30:55.766 --> 30:57.899
Only until we set off again

30:57.943 --> 30:59.901
to find a thing
more permanent.

30:59.945 --> 31:02.861
We'll be working
with the foresters soon.

31:02.904 --> 31:04.819
Well, it's beginning to appear

31:04.863 --> 31:07.300
the foresters
will have to wait a while.

31:10.912 --> 31:12.435
Finders keepers.

31:20.748 --> 31:22.445
WITCH: The sliding door
to your right.

31:34.283 --> 31:37.025
Lyes and vinegars
on that shelf.

31:37.069 --> 31:39.549
Soap from animal fat,
just there.

31:45.816 --> 31:48.167
And the blade high like this,

31:49.168 --> 31:50.517
then lay it down easy.

31:53.389 --> 31:55.478
Very good.

31:55.522 --> 31:57.567
Once you've gotten
the hang of it,

31:57.611 --> 32:00.135
you can move on
to the others in the shed.

32:16.935 --> 32:20.155
My, my. Aren't you handsome.

33:06.245 --> 33:08.464
WITCH: Nothing to sneeze at.

33:10.162 --> 33:11.641
Even with the heat
of your blushing,

33:11.685 --> 33:14.209
you have the onset of a chill.

33:14.253 --> 33:17.430
Here,
let me show you something.

33:17.473 --> 33:20.346
Licorice root,
garlic, calendula,

33:20.389 --> 33:23.436
usnealichen,
yarrow flower, milkvetch,

33:23.479 --> 33:26.178
and finally, cat's claw.

33:30.443 --> 33:31.313
Ah.

33:34.708 --> 33:35.796
Here.

33:37.537 --> 33:38.581
What?

33:38.625 --> 33:40.061
You drink it.

33:40.105 --> 33:41.236
Oh, I don't...

33:41.280 --> 33:43.586
Tomorrow you will be
a new girl.

33:43.630 --> 33:47.242
If not tomorrow,
then soon enough.

33:47.286 --> 33:49.549
In any case, you will
have taken a first step.

34:00.212 --> 34:02.475
The foul smell
is only an ugly gatekeeper

34:02.518 --> 34:04.607
in front of
the palace of wonders.

34:04.651 --> 34:08.350
Stop with him at the gates,
or see what goes on inside.

34:59.967 --> 35:01.925
You're coming with me!

35:08.410 --> 35:09.716
Idiot trees.

35:16.201 --> 35:17.115
WITCH:
You'll get the hang of it.

35:18.768 --> 35:20.857
Always remember,

35:20.901 --> 35:23.773
the king is afraid,
and he should be.

35:23.817 --> 35:25.993
Because the queen can do
whatever she wants.

35:27.560 --> 35:28.430
Gretel,

35:29.257 --> 35:30.780
it's naked.

35:34.132 --> 35:35.220
GRETEL: Your go.

35:39.093 --> 35:41.139
-There's a storm coming.
-HANSEL: There isn't.

35:41.182 --> 35:42.662
Be quiet.

35:42.705 --> 35:44.142
HANSEL: I was out all day.

35:44.185 --> 35:47.536
I know what rain clouds
look like, and there was none.

35:47.580 --> 35:48.929
In any case,

35:48.972 --> 35:51.192
I brought your axe in for you
just to be safe.

35:56.806 --> 35:58.243
How'd you know?

35:58.286 --> 35:59.809
Because women
often know things

35:59.853 --> 36:01.246
they're not supposed to.

36:02.203 --> 36:04.118
Don't we, Gretel?

36:04.162 --> 36:05.772
HANSEL: Gretel's not a woman.

36:05.815 --> 36:07.382
Oh, no? And if not?

36:08.427 --> 36:09.167
What?

36:11.778 --> 36:14.084
Is she a snake? A frog?

36:14.476 --> 36:15.912
A pig?

37:31.553 --> 37:32.772
CHILD:
Don't look at us.

37:39.213 --> 37:40.649
Don't look at us here.

37:43.913 --> 37:45.785
Down in our hole
in the ground.

37:48.744 --> 37:50.442
We've gotten old down here.

37:53.706 --> 37:54.402
Don't look at us.

37:56.317 --> 38:00.060
Don't look at us here.

38:00.103 --> 38:02.149
Down in the ground.

38:06.327 --> 38:07.633
We've gotten old down here.

38:19.253 --> 38:20.341
Don't look at us.

38:23.736 --> 38:24.650
Don't look at us.

38:27.827 --> 38:28.654
Don't look at us.

39:34.197 --> 39:35.895
GRETEL: Were the dreams
I was having

39:35.938 --> 39:38.550
only the result of too much
rich food before bed?

39:43.946 --> 39:45.208
Were they a message?

39:46.296 --> 39:47.341
A warning?

39:50.388 --> 39:52.651
Was I now missing a chance
to listen to myself?

40:38.392 --> 40:39.393
GRETEL: Hey.

40:41.569 --> 40:44.224
We'd be wise to leave
before outstaying our welcome.

40:44.267 --> 40:45.268
What?

40:45.921 --> 40:46.792
Leave?

40:46.835 --> 40:48.402
Yes.

40:48.446 --> 40:49.882
And continue on
to the foresters,

40:49.925 --> 40:51.318
like we said we would.

40:51.361 --> 40:53.929
We've found work
to be done here.

40:53.973 --> 40:56.323
You probably noticed the food.

40:56.366 --> 40:58.151
There's something wrong here.

40:58.194 --> 41:00.849
But it's so pleasant.

41:00.893 --> 41:03.069
But tell me what hides
behind that pleasantness.

41:04.636 --> 41:06.812
There are things here,
bad things.

41:07.769 --> 41:09.075
What bad things?

41:09.118 --> 41:10.468
The abundance, for one.

41:10.511 --> 41:12.078
What's that mean?

41:12.121 --> 41:13.645
It means "too much."

41:14.820 --> 41:16.604
There's too much,
and it isn't right.

41:17.387 --> 41:18.606
Where are the animals?

41:19.564 --> 41:21.435
From where does she draw milk?

41:21.479 --> 41:24.699
From where does she conjure up
her endless parade of cakes?

41:24.743 --> 41:27.572
There are souls trapped
in this house, or under it.

41:27.615 --> 41:30.226
But why do you
always see a problem?

41:30.270 --> 41:33.926
Something behind or under?
Something hidden?

41:33.969 --> 41:36.406
Because the big,
bad world is what it is.

41:36.450 --> 41:39.845
We're safe now from the world.
Isn't that what you want?

41:47.156 --> 41:50.333
Perhaps tomorrow
you can send me for supplies.

41:50.377 --> 41:52.379
Mother says I have an eye
for good produce.

41:52.422 --> 41:54.381
WITCH:
That won't be necessary.

42:01.693 --> 42:03.651
Plums only keep for three days
out of season.

42:05.479 --> 42:07.699
And that ham is unsalted.
It must be going bad.

42:08.830 --> 42:09.788
And yet, it isn't.

42:30.025 --> 42:30.765
Yes!

43:06.105 --> 43:07.062
CHILD: Hansel, Gretel.

43:27.735 --> 43:29.345
Come across an old one,
have you?

43:29.389 --> 43:30.695
One that's had
too much to drink.

43:36.831 --> 43:39.138
You'll find another
in the cupboard in the hall.

43:39.181 --> 43:40.618
Towards the back.

44:40.242 --> 44:43.115
When you've found it,
let me show you something.

45:15.016 --> 45:17.192
WITCH: The thought in your head is,

45:17.236 --> 45:19.412
"Go look in the shed."

45:19.455 --> 45:22.589
You'll find saws
to be sharpened

45:22.632 --> 45:25.200
for the bones of the dead.

45:25.244 --> 45:29.465
The thought in your head is, "Go look in the shed."

45:29.509 --> 45:32.512
You'll find saws
to be sharpened

45:32.555 --> 45:35.210
for the bones of the dead.

45:35.254 --> 45:39.301
What eats with its teeth,
but never feels fed?

45:46.874 --> 45:48.615
Are you having dreams?

45:49.703 --> 45:50.922
On some nights.

45:52.358 --> 45:54.273
On some nights,
I don't sleep at all.

45:54.316 --> 45:55.709
WITCH: Awake,

45:55.753 --> 45:57.363
listening to the woods?

45:59.887 --> 46:00.845
Good.

46:02.150 --> 46:05.806
The air is swirling
with abundance.

46:05.850 --> 46:08.809
One need only reach out
and pluck it.

46:10.506 --> 46:12.247
This is your power,

46:12.291 --> 46:14.206
to see what is hidden
and to take it.

46:17.035 --> 46:20.908
A small mind believes
only what it can see.

46:22.170 --> 46:24.999
Carves out a little square,

46:25.043 --> 46:27.610
waits to be taken,

46:27.654 --> 46:29.961
never wondering
what governs its fate.

46:32.441 --> 46:37.011
But we know that we are our
fate's own masters, don't we?

46:38.578 --> 46:41.886
Those like me
and those like you,

46:41.929 --> 46:45.411
we commune
with the Great Provider.

46:47.413 --> 46:50.633
She gives us
the seeds of abundance,

46:50.677 --> 46:53.027
and we grow them
in our garden.

46:55.551 --> 46:57.684
We harvest it, and with it,

46:58.554 --> 47:01.775
we impart justice.

47:01.819 --> 47:04.343
You say "we," but I've not
agreed to anything.

47:04.386 --> 47:07.607
It's not for you to agree
or disagree, my pretty.

47:08.434 --> 47:10.044
It's already inside of you.

47:11.524 --> 47:13.874
You can either
stay asleep to it...

47:16.355 --> 47:17.704
or let it wake up.

47:28.846 --> 47:29.847
Now,

47:30.891 --> 47:31.936
the salve.

47:58.223 --> 47:59.485
I see it likes you.

48:12.019 --> 48:14.108
Now, tell it what to do.

48:14.152 --> 48:15.414
"Tell it"?

48:15.457 --> 48:17.764
You've talked to things
before. I know you have.

48:21.463 --> 48:23.552
What can it do?

48:23.596 --> 48:26.294
It can do more than just
lie there like spilled milk.

48:38.089 --> 48:39.917
You decided to wake it up,
after all.

48:41.266 --> 48:42.484
But how did it...

48:42.528 --> 48:44.617
WITCH: Think less, my pretty,
and know more.

48:46.488 --> 48:47.533
Go ahead.

48:47.576 --> 48:49.535
It awaits its master.

49:38.105 --> 49:41.021
WITCH: The bones of the dead.

49:41.979 --> 49:45.373
The bones of the dead.

49:52.990 --> 49:56.384
The bones of the dead.

51:49.018 --> 51:51.020
WITCH: Have another bite,
won't you?

51:51.064 --> 51:52.805
-I don't want another bite.

51:52.848 --> 51:55.764
Even if it bit me,
I wouldn't bite it back.

51:55.808 --> 51:58.506
But it's your favorite,
my little champion.

51:58.550 --> 52:00.813
I even stuffed the crust.

52:00.856 --> 52:03.163
HANSEL: And it'll be here
again tomorrow,

52:03.207 --> 52:04.904
as sure as the sun,

52:04.947 --> 52:06.775
and with even less
explanation.

52:06.819 --> 52:09.300
Quiet. You're being rude.

52:09.343 --> 52:11.693
Now bite your tongue
and eat your food.

52:18.352 --> 52:20.137
HANSEL: What do you do
with her all day?

52:21.877 --> 52:22.965
She teaches me.

52:24.228 --> 52:25.794
Things that could
save my life,

52:25.838 --> 52:27.187
that could make my life.

52:27.231 --> 52:28.406
She's not our mother,
you know.

52:29.885 --> 52:31.539
It's true, she isn't.

52:33.802 --> 52:36.240
She has much to give.

52:36.283 --> 52:38.851
You wouldn't understand.
There are many gifts here.

52:38.894 --> 52:41.941
You always say there aren't
any gifts in this world.

52:41.984 --> 52:45.031
That nothing is given
without something taken away.

52:45.074 --> 52:46.467
So, tell me this,

52:47.468 --> 52:49.209
what is she taking?

52:51.168 --> 52:52.995
I'm scared now,

52:53.039 --> 52:54.867
and I want to go home.

52:55.955 --> 52:58.131
I wanna see Mother.

52:58.175 --> 53:00.177
We both know
there's nothing there.

53:00.220 --> 53:01.569
But gifts?

53:01.613 --> 53:03.441
Are you forgetting?

53:03.484 --> 53:05.182
Forgetting to be
afraid of gifts?

53:06.661 --> 53:07.749
I'm not.

53:07.793 --> 53:09.490
What about the story?

53:09.534 --> 53:11.449
"Once upon a time,
a girl was born."

53:11.492 --> 53:13.102
It's not like that.

53:13.146 --> 53:14.365
But "all in the village agreed

53:14.408 --> 53:15.931
"that she was the most
beautiful child."

53:15.975 --> 53:18.630
You'd do well
to shut your mouth.

53:18.673 --> 53:20.849
"It came to be that she was
touched with the gift of--"

53:23.896 --> 53:26.203
Fall quiet, boy.

53:26.246 --> 53:28.422
For I shall write
my own story.

53:30.424 --> 53:31.817
Gretel.

53:31.860 --> 53:33.732
You wanna leave?

53:33.775 --> 53:34.950
Let me show you how.

53:45.047 --> 53:47.398
Gretel! Don't leave me!

53:48.747 --> 53:49.748
Gretel!

54:06.373 --> 54:07.374
BEAUTIFUL CHILD:
Follow me.

54:25.566 --> 54:27.525
GRETEL: Surely, that had
only been a nightmare.

54:27.568 --> 54:29.918
The desire to be rid of him
was very real.

54:29.962 --> 54:32.486
But to send him off alone
into the night,

54:32.530 --> 54:33.444
that could never be true.

54:34.706 --> 54:35.620
Hansel?

55:34.853 --> 55:36.420
He's out sulking,

55:37.508 --> 55:39.118
blaming the strength
of the trees

55:39.161 --> 55:40.424
for his own weakness.

55:41.425 --> 55:42.382
He's a little boy.

55:44.732 --> 55:47.779
Even the littlest pebble
makes it difficult to travel

55:47.822 --> 55:50.521
once it gets its way
into your boot.

55:51.826 --> 55:53.524
You've taken him on
as a burden.

55:55.830 --> 55:57.702
But last night
you shrugged it off.

55:57.745 --> 55:59.007
Did I?

55:59.051 --> 56:00.052
Didn't you?

56:02.184 --> 56:04.665
You're not his mother.

56:04.709 --> 56:06.450
And still, you don't remember

56:06.493 --> 56:08.452
the last time
you couldn't be sure

56:08.495 --> 56:09.801
of where your little boy
could be.

56:11.716 --> 56:13.239
He shouldn't be off
on his own.

56:13.805 --> 56:14.806
Maybe not.

56:18.070 --> 56:19.419
But you definitely should be.

56:31.518 --> 56:32.606
I ought to go to bed,

56:34.608 --> 56:36.828
to be up with the sun
to search for my brother.

56:36.871 --> 56:38.220
An excellent plan.

56:43.530 --> 56:45.532
But I do fear
a restless night ahead.

56:47.839 --> 56:50.363
Might you prepare for me
something to help me sleep?

56:50.407 --> 56:53.845
I'll fix you a sleeper.
She always does the trick.

56:53.888 --> 56:55.586
You'll sleep like a baby...

56:57.370 --> 57:00.417
If the baby has just got into
her mother's sleepers.

57:03.985 --> 57:04.986
Yes.

57:06.118 --> 57:07.119
Thank you.

57:22.787 --> 57:25.354
WITCH: Careful
with a sleeping draft.

57:25.398 --> 57:28.532
A leaf or a twig
this way or that,

57:28.575 --> 57:30.185
you get a very
different mixture.

57:32.013 --> 57:33.711
A soup of nightmares.

57:45.200 --> 57:46.463
Well, good night, then.

59:49.455 --> 59:52.414
Come on now.
This is no place for you.

59:53.677 --> 59:55.200
Come now and look at me.

1:02:34.838 --> 1:02:36.187
GRETEL:
It didn't matter anymore

1:02:36.230 --> 1:02:39.233
if I dreamt it
or really lived it.

1:02:39.277 --> 1:02:40.887
The horror of what I had seen under the house

1:02:40.931 --> 1:02:43.324
was proof
of what I already knew.

1:02:43.368 --> 1:02:46.675
All I could do now was
keep calm and play dumb,

1:02:46.719 --> 1:02:48.721
only for long enough
to outsmart her.

1:02:48.765 --> 1:02:50.767
WITCH: Disturbing night,
was it not?

1:02:53.117 --> 1:02:56.860
Did you feel the wind
coming down from the hills

1:02:56.903 --> 1:03:00.211
rattling all the windows
facing east?

1:03:00.254 --> 1:03:01.865
I suppose I didn't.

1:03:04.084 --> 1:03:06.783
Desired result of
my sleeping draft, I'm sure.

1:03:09.263 --> 1:03:11.483
You saw there's fresh milk?

1:03:13.920 --> 1:03:14.878
I saw.

1:03:16.488 --> 1:03:17.489
Yum.

1:03:21.885 --> 1:03:23.800
Any sign
of our little runaway?

1:03:24.626 --> 1:03:25.845
No, none.

1:03:27.891 --> 1:03:29.893
Well, I'll keep a nose
and an ear out.

1:03:30.937 --> 1:03:31.895
You're going somewhere?

1:03:33.548 --> 1:03:35.812
It's not regular
that nature calls out to me,

1:03:35.855 --> 1:03:37.857
but when she does,
I try to answer.

1:03:40.512 --> 1:03:41.730
Mind the kettle, would you?

1:03:45.082 --> 1:03:47.127
Fix me a cup of tea
for when I'm back.

1:03:47.171 --> 1:03:48.476
That'd be nice.

1:03:48.520 --> 1:03:50.391
And leave the food out.

1:03:50.435 --> 1:03:52.916
Maybe I'll want
to bite something later.

1:04:49.494 --> 1:04:52.236
CHILDREN:
Bless the day if you dare

1:04:52.279 --> 1:04:55.108
to desire to be born again.

1:05:19.741 --> 1:05:21.700
WITCH: I've been thinking,

1:05:21.743 --> 1:05:24.529
maybe it's for the best
that Hansel isn't with us.

1:05:26.139 --> 1:05:27.184
Isn't?

1:05:27.227 --> 1:05:29.926
He'll soon come to fear you,

1:05:29.969 --> 1:05:31.449
as all men should
if they're smart.

1:05:32.493 --> 1:05:37.281
And fear so easily
turns to hatred.

1:05:37.324 --> 1:05:40.719
Better that he remember you
as you were,

1:05:40.762 --> 1:05:42.851
rather than
as you're meant to be.

1:05:54.776 --> 1:05:56.648
With all that
you're showing me,

1:05:56.691 --> 1:05:58.650
will I one day
be very powerful?

1:06:00.565 --> 1:06:02.697
You will be.

1:06:02.741 --> 1:06:06.136
Will I have mastery
and dominion over everything?

1:06:06.179 --> 1:06:07.964
WITCH: Nearly everything.

1:06:08.007 --> 1:06:12.055
We must accept our weaknesses.

1:06:13.447 --> 1:06:17.060
Have you one? A vulnerability?

1:06:17.103 --> 1:06:20.063
Only that which has taken
a part of me.

1:06:22.674 --> 1:06:25.590
Only that which has taken
a part of you.

1:06:27.809 --> 1:06:30.812
And to you
it will be a poison.

1:06:30.856 --> 1:06:33.424
And so you must consume it,

1:06:33.467 --> 1:06:37.036
lest it consume you first.

1:06:37.080 --> 1:06:39.082
Consume poison?

1:06:39.125 --> 1:06:43.738
How else will one
develop an immunity?

1:06:43.782 --> 1:06:46.698
But the thing about poison

1:06:46.741 --> 1:06:49.483
is that out of everything
in the big, bad world,

1:06:49.527 --> 1:06:51.790
nothing tastes as sweet.

1:07:49.674 --> 1:07:51.850
What did you do
with my brother?

1:07:51.893 --> 1:07:55.158
I am only moving him
out of your way.

1:07:55.201 --> 1:07:57.464
He's all I have in this world.

1:07:57.508 --> 1:08:00.728
Say that again and I will turn
your tongue into a flower,

1:08:02.034 --> 1:08:06.604
to remind you
of how pretty and dumb,

1:08:06.647 --> 1:08:10.086
temporary,
you've chosen to be.

1:08:12.305 --> 1:08:15.265
Or you may follow the path
that I've lit for you.

1:08:17.005 --> 1:08:18.703
Do whatever you want with me,

1:08:19.443 --> 1:08:21.140
but only if you free him.

1:08:22.924 --> 1:08:24.274
I could never do that.

1:08:25.797 --> 1:08:26.798
GRETEL: But why not?

1:08:28.365 --> 1:08:31.107
Because that little boy
is your poison.

1:08:33.370 --> 1:08:38.026
All that is left
is to make him delicious.

1:08:40.420 --> 1:08:41.117
You can't.

1:08:41.856 --> 1:08:43.031
My dear,

1:08:44.032 --> 1:08:45.991
I can't remember a time

1:08:48.515 --> 1:08:50.952
when there was anything else
I cared to do.

1:08:53.041 --> 1:08:54.347
I envy you,

1:08:56.871 --> 1:09:00.310
standing at the threshold
of your own experience,

1:09:01.833 --> 1:09:03.443
with everything ahead of you.

1:09:11.451 --> 1:09:13.018
To be young again.

1:09:39.044 --> 1:09:40.393
A nice balance.

1:09:41.786 --> 1:09:43.831
I admire the application.

1:09:43.875 --> 1:09:45.572
But more than anything

1:09:45.616 --> 1:09:47.966
it leaves me curious
as to why,

1:09:48.009 --> 1:09:49.402
why you would try
to put me to sleep

1:09:49.446 --> 1:09:51.491
when there is so much
to be done.

1:09:51.535 --> 1:09:53.406
I won't do
what you want me to do.

1:09:55.060 --> 1:09:56.453
I'm nothing like you.

1:09:56.496 --> 1:09:58.803
We are made
from the same matter,

1:10:00.065 --> 1:10:02.198
the same filth.

1:10:06.941 --> 1:10:08.943
Otherwise,
how would you know my story

1:10:08.987 --> 1:10:11.207
without me
having to tell it to you?

1:10:13.034 --> 1:10:14.253
Your story?

1:10:15.167 --> 1:10:16.908
We were given the same gift,

1:10:16.951 --> 1:10:19.693
the same magic...

1:10:21.652 --> 1:10:23.219
just as she was,

1:10:27.005 --> 1:10:28.920
with her little pink cap.

1:10:31.096 --> 1:10:32.228
How do you know my s...

1:10:42.499 --> 1:10:44.718
WITCH: I know
that's your favorite story,

1:10:44.762 --> 1:10:47.243
but you have been
telling it wrong.

1:10:49.549 --> 1:10:50.768
It's true,

1:10:50.811 --> 1:10:54.206
she was
a most beautiful child,

1:10:54.250 --> 1:10:55.512
and everyone could see that.

1:10:56.208 --> 1:10:57.992
But on the inside,

1:10:59.037 --> 1:11:01.953
she was rotten to her core

1:11:01.996 --> 1:11:04.260
and as sweet as vinegar.

1:11:05.522 --> 1:11:08.133
Even I hated her,

1:11:08.176 --> 1:11:09.656
and I was her mother.

1:11:16.446 --> 1:11:18.622
Because from me,
she took everything.

1:11:23.409 --> 1:11:26.717
And would have
destroyed me too,

1:11:26.760 --> 1:11:29.241
if I didn't
get rid of her first.

1:11:30.416 --> 1:11:32.940
So I gave her back
to the darkness

1:11:32.984 --> 1:11:34.246
that had made her,

1:11:34.290 --> 1:11:36.683
and thought that would be
the end of it.

1:11:37.510 --> 1:11:39.556
But I was wrong.

1:11:39.599 --> 1:11:42.254
She stayed with me.

1:11:42.298 --> 1:11:48.608
In my thoughts, in my dreams, attached to me like my shadow,

1:11:48.652 --> 1:11:54.527
promising me a taste
of the powers that she had.

1:11:54.571 --> 1:11:58.226
All that was required
was for me to be brave

1:11:58.270 --> 1:12:01.317
and to trust the darkness.

1:12:01.360 --> 1:12:02.753
And I was,

1:12:02.796 --> 1:12:04.842
and I did.

1:12:04.885 --> 1:12:06.583
And like she had done,

1:12:06.626 --> 1:12:10.630
I rid myself
of all other attachments.

1:12:10.674 --> 1:12:13.067
I cleared my plate.

1:12:13.111 --> 1:12:16.636
I ate my children.

1:12:16.680 --> 1:12:21.162
So hungry was I to realize
my own powers,

1:12:21.206 --> 1:12:24.078
I hardly even chewed.

1:12:24.122 --> 1:12:27.865
I assumed
a disguise of old age

1:12:27.908 --> 1:12:31.869
to make myself
seem kind and weak.

1:12:33.087 --> 1:12:36.439
I built for us a house,

1:12:36.482 --> 1:12:41.444
one with a proper kitchen
and a dining room.

1:12:45.883 --> 1:12:49.756
I could name them
all if ever I had to.

1:12:52.324 --> 1:12:55.849
There was
a Thomas and an Isabella,

1:12:55.893 --> 1:12:57.982
a darling William

1:12:58.025 --> 1:13:00.941
and a precious Elizabeth,

1:13:00.985 --> 1:13:03.422
a Harry and a Sarah,

1:13:03.466 --> 1:13:06.033
a Paul, a Kate.

1:13:08.471 --> 1:13:10.473
And now, just for you,

1:13:11.691 --> 1:13:13.214
a Hansel.

1:13:15.086 --> 1:13:19.569
Only rid yourself of him
and embrace your powers.

1:13:22.093 --> 1:13:25.270
Such a sweet boy.

1:13:25.313 --> 1:13:29.492
Sweet and plump, and fair.

1:13:29.535 --> 1:13:30.623
Where is he?

1:13:32.146 --> 1:13:33.670
Where is my brother?

1:13:48.946 --> 1:13:51.688
WITCH: So stay a while,
won't you?

1:13:51.731 --> 1:13:55.213
Who knows,
you might even enjoy it.

1:13:57.694 --> 1:14:00.479
I only hope you're hungry.

1:14:16.364 --> 1:14:18.192
Bedtime for you,

1:14:18.889 --> 1:14:20.107
little darling.

1:14:21.500 --> 1:14:23.807
Go and kiss
your sister good night.

1:14:45.568 --> 1:14:49.310
Brother, hear me.

1:14:49.354 --> 1:14:51.965
I know you're in there.
I'm going to get you out.

1:14:52.009 --> 1:14:55.882
Even though you are blinded,
you'll see my face again.

1:14:55.926 --> 1:14:57.710
That is my
forever promise to you.

1:15:09.287 --> 1:15:11.115
YOUNG WITCH: That's enough.

1:15:11.158 --> 1:15:13.247
Now up to bed.

1:15:33.833 --> 1:15:35.226
There's a good boy.

1:16:25.276 --> 1:16:26.277
What a world.

1:16:33.371 --> 1:16:34.851
Hansel, hold!

1:16:50.127 --> 1:16:50.997
Hansel!

1:17:48.925 --> 1:17:50.056
Gretel.

1:17:50.100 --> 1:17:51.014
Quiet now.

1:17:52.276 --> 1:17:53.146
You're all right.

1:17:54.844 --> 1:17:57.673
And you will be, just as long
as I got a voice in it.

1:17:58.543 --> 1:18:00.763
But what about her?

1:18:00.806 --> 1:18:02.286
She doesn't live here anymore.

1:18:05.158 --> 1:18:07.378
Gretel, you're scared.

1:18:09.119 --> 1:18:10.294
What of?

1:18:12.165 --> 1:18:13.253
Of the world?

1:18:15.821 --> 1:18:16.692
No...

1:18:18.606 --> 1:18:19.869
only of myself.

1:18:27.485 --> 1:18:29.095
You will always have
a part of me, brother.

1:18:31.707 --> 1:18:33.752
A part of myself
that you have not taken,

1:18:33.796 --> 1:18:35.188
but that I have
given to you gladly.

1:18:38.583 --> 1:18:40.063
It will go with you
when you leave.

1:18:43.240 --> 1:18:44.632
When I leave?

1:18:45.677 --> 1:18:46.809
Without you?

1:18:48.201 --> 1:18:49.594
GRETEL: Yes.

1:18:51.291 --> 1:18:53.946
The single story that
we shared now splits in two,

1:18:55.208 --> 1:18:56.819
and we take forking paths.

1:18:58.429 --> 1:19:00.648
Yours will lead you
to what you need to find.

1:19:02.999 --> 1:19:04.304
Mine will carry me up.

1:19:14.053 --> 1:19:15.838
I told him
to take good care of you.

1:19:17.491 --> 1:19:18.971
He'll see to it
that you arrive safely.

1:19:22.322 --> 1:19:25.804
Gretel,
you'll see my face again.

1:19:33.246 --> 1:19:36.336
But anyway,
where is he taking me?

1:19:46.129 --> 1:19:47.913
GRETEL: Letting him go
wasn't hard to do.

1:19:49.393 --> 1:19:50.829
If he's going to find his way,

1:19:50.873 --> 1:19:52.439
I can't very well be
standing in it,

1:19:53.789 --> 1:19:55.268
just as he shouldn't
stand in mine.

1:19:57.314 --> 1:19:59.272
I could see she was right
about that at least.

1:20:09.848 --> 1:20:11.110
Let him find his own story,

1:20:13.896 --> 1:20:15.462
and his own courage
to live it...

1:20:23.122 --> 1:20:24.820
...just as I now
go on to live mine.

1:20:26.560 --> 1:20:28.040
I have my own power
to nurture.

1:20:29.389 --> 1:20:30.956
I'll help it to grow,

1:20:31.000 --> 1:20:33.306
and trust that I'll know
what to do with it.

1:20:33.350 --> 1:20:35.700
I know
that the choice is mine.

1:20:35.743 --> 1:20:38.834
I could feed it darkness,
or give it plenty of light.

1:21:06.774 --> 1:21:08.515
I looked, and I saw,

1:21:09.255 --> 1:21:10.735
and I understood.

1:21:14.043 --> 1:21:16.567
The captor now gone
and her fires all put out,

1:21:18.917 --> 1:21:20.136
they were free to go...

1:21:24.357 --> 1:21:25.663
and be at peace.

1:21:31.799 --> 1:21:33.279
And I was free.

1:21:35.455 --> 1:21:37.631
To go and never look back,

1:21:37.675 --> 1:21:39.329
or stay to build something new

1:21:39.372 --> 1:21:42.114
on top of everything
that had been destroyed.

1:21:42.158 --> 1:21:44.812
I knew my path
would reveal itself,

1:21:44.856 --> 1:21:47.685
and that all was required
for me was to be brave

1:21:47.728 --> 1:21:49.382
and to trust myself.

1:22:04.267 --> 1:22:05.529
And I am brave.

1:22:06.922 --> 1:22:08.706
And I will trust myself.
