[tone]

00:03.371 --> 00:06.774
[theme music]

00:49.883 --> 00:52.286
[laughter]

00:52.386 --> 00:57.291
[music playing]

00:57.391 --> 00:59.793
Was the baby up all
night again, Crystal?

00:59.893 --> 01:00.928
Oh, yeah.

01:01.028 --> 01:02.830
But I'm not complaining.

01:02.930 --> 01:04.298
I mean I have seen
all kinds of things

01:04.398 --> 01:06.300
that you never see if you
are getting any kind of sleep

01:06.400 --> 01:08.902
at all.

01:09.002 --> 01:11.439
Then I watch the
sun rise and set.

01:11.539 --> 01:14.007
Rise and set.

01:14.108 --> 01:16.210
Did you know that
Big Valley comes

01:16.310 --> 01:19.580
on at 5:00 in the morning?

01:19.680 --> 01:20.981
[crying]

01:21.081 --> 01:25.453
And again at 6:30.

01:25.553 --> 01:28.156
Oh, come here, Louette,
come see your auntie,

01:28.256 --> 01:30.424
sister-in-law, whatever,
Roseanne, while mommy

01:30.524 --> 01:33.927
has her little break down.

01:34.027 --> 01:35.496
What is wrong with him?

01:35.596 --> 01:37.598
Nothing's wrong with him,
Crystal, here's just a baby.

01:37.698 --> 01:38.699
Well, why won't he sleep?

01:38.799 --> 01:41.702
I tried everything, even
the washing machine.

01:41.802 --> 01:45.173
You put him in
the washing machine.

01:45.273 --> 01:46.807
No, Darlene.

01:46.907 --> 01:49.877
You put him in his little
baby seat on the washer

01:49.977 --> 01:53.381
and the vibrations are supposed
to soothe him to sleep.

01:53.481 --> 01:55.015
Yeah, you know when you
were a baby we couldn't

01:55.115 --> 01:56.150
afford a washing machine.

01:56.250 --> 01:58.419
So I had to take you
down to the river

01:58.519 --> 01:59.787
and beat you against a rock.

02:03.291 --> 02:04.292
Why are you picking on me?

02:04.392 --> 02:06.994
What, did I take the
last donut or something?

02:07.094 --> 02:08.929
Hey.

02:09.029 --> 02:10.831
Becky, you want
some breakfast?

02:10.931 --> 02:12.400
No, I was just going
to run over Jackie's

02:12.500 --> 02:13.367
and return this top.

02:13.467 --> 02:14.268
Oh, great.

02:14.368 --> 02:15.169
Let me have that.

02:15.269 --> 02:16.270
I can put it in with this load.

02:16.370 --> 02:17.438
- Oh, you're here.
- Yeah.

02:17.538 --> 02:18.339
Of course.

02:20.641 --> 02:22.109
Good, because I
think those earrings

02:22.210 --> 02:23.177
I borrowed from you, too.

02:23.277 --> 02:24.478
Which earrings?

02:24.578 --> 02:25.379
I think they're yours.

02:25.479 --> 02:27.748
Why don't you come up to see?

02:27.848 --> 02:28.649
Oh, OK.

02:28.749 --> 02:29.550
Great.

02:36.557 --> 02:39.393
What's she going to go
griping to Aunt Jackie about?

02:39.493 --> 02:41.128
Well, it could
be a lot of things.

02:41.229 --> 02:42.029
But it's always you.

03:02.550 --> 03:05.786
You want a
cigarette with that?

03:05.886 --> 03:06.687
No.

03:06.787 --> 03:07.988
I'm good.

03:08.088 --> 03:10.023
Well, you know, too much
coffee gives you the shakes

03:10.123 --> 03:11.459
and then you cut
yourself shaving.

03:14.495 --> 03:15.296
[crying]

03:15.396 --> 03:16.196
Oh.

03:16.297 --> 03:18.566
What now?

03:18.666 --> 03:19.767
Oh, Roseanne, I
think he's hungry.

03:19.867 --> 03:21.068
Here.
Will you hold him for a second?

03:21.168 --> 03:21.969
Oh.

03:22.069 --> 03:23.237
Give me.

03:23.337 --> 03:25.906
Give me that baby.

03:26.006 --> 03:27.174
You, your little head.

03:27.275 --> 03:30.411
It smells so good, don't you?

03:30.511 --> 03:33.581
Your head smells so sweet.

03:33.681 --> 03:35.749
Oh, head smells sweet.

03:35.849 --> 03:37.084
Smell his head, Darlene.

03:37.184 --> 03:39.253
Smell your uncle's head.

03:39.353 --> 03:41.088
Get that thing away from me.

03:41.188 --> 03:43.524
Roseanne, I'm exposed here.

03:43.624 --> 03:44.758
Oh, sorry.

03:44.858 --> 03:45.959
Come on, little Ed.

03:46.059 --> 03:48.596
We're going to see what
mommy's got for breakfast.

03:48.696 --> 03:51.765
Oh, shucks, it's
just milk again.

03:51.865 --> 03:55.135
Come here, little Ed.

03:55.235 --> 03:56.770
I'm going to get going.

03:59.807 --> 04:01.575
- You coming home for dinner?
- I don't know.

04:01.675 --> 04:03.277
It depends on what we're having.
Hi, Dan.

04:03.377 --> 04:04.478
Hey, Crystal.
Woah!

04:04.578 --> 04:05.379
Hello.

04:07.715 --> 04:10.017
Hey, Dad, smell
the baby's head.

04:10.117 --> 04:11.719
How's the
motorcycle shop, Dan?

04:11.819 --> 04:12.653
Good.
Good, real fine.

04:12.753 --> 04:13.854
Sell a bike yet?

04:13.954 --> 04:18.392
No, no, but we're getting
a lot of repair work.

04:18.492 --> 04:21.161
Boy, that ceiling
needs some spackle.

04:21.261 --> 04:24.298
Does this make you
uncomfortable, Dan?

04:24.398 --> 04:25.299
Oh, no.

04:25.399 --> 04:28.268
it's a beautiful natural thing.

04:28.369 --> 04:29.169
I got to get going.

04:33.106 --> 04:34.575
Oh, now, Dan,
it's not like you've

04:34.675 --> 04:36.043
never seen breasts before.

04:36.143 --> 04:37.144
Crystal's my friend.

04:37.244 --> 04:40.414
As far as I'm concerned,
she has no breasts.

04:40.514 --> 04:42.383
It works for me, OK?

04:42.483 --> 04:44.318
Yeah, OK.

04:44.418 --> 04:46.186
So when are you coming home?

04:46.286 --> 04:47.488
Maybe early.

04:47.588 --> 04:49.089
Mark's coming by to help me
rebuild that old triumph.

04:49.189 --> 04:50.524
Becky's Mark?

04:50.624 --> 04:53.361
What is he officially
working for you now?

04:53.461 --> 04:55.329
Roseanne, he's really
there with these old bikes.

04:55.429 --> 04:56.229
He works cheap.

04:56.330 --> 04:58.499
And it's only for a couple days.

04:58.599 --> 05:00.368
Dad, quick, Crystal's
switching sides.

05:00.468 --> 05:01.268
I'm out of here.

05:05.939 --> 05:07.207
Is he OK?

05:07.307 --> 05:08.141
Oh, Yeah.

05:08.241 --> 05:10.978
He's just a leg man.

05:11.078 --> 05:12.380
What is it now?

05:12.480 --> 05:16.216
You don't want to eat,
and you don't want sleep.

05:16.316 --> 05:17.651
Oh.

05:17.751 --> 05:20.020
Oh.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.288
Where can I change him?

05:21.389 --> 05:23.891
Your house.

05:23.991 --> 05:26.093
You can change him in my room.

05:26.193 --> 05:27.461
OK, be right back.

05:27.561 --> 05:29.397
Roseanne, can we talk
to you for a minute.

05:29.497 --> 05:30.297
Yeah, sure.

05:30.398 --> 05:31.565
Go ahead.

05:31.665 --> 05:33.867
It's kind of a personal.

05:33.967 --> 05:34.835
Oh.

05:34.935 --> 05:39.907
Darlene, go out and play.

05:40.007 --> 05:40.808
Play?

05:40.908 --> 05:43.276
I don't play, Mother.

05:43.377 --> 05:44.378
Play.
Pack.

05:44.478 --> 05:45.278
Whatever.

05:50.584 --> 05:53.654
Well, I guess now mom gets
to be let in on the big secret.

05:53.754 --> 05:56.857
Now Roseanne, Becky's got
something really important she

05:56.957 --> 05:57.958
wants to talk to you about.

05:58.058 --> 06:00.661
And she'd like for you
to be really sensitive.

06:00.761 --> 06:01.929
Just forget about it.
I can't--

06:02.029 --> 06:03.163
No, yes, you can.

06:03.263 --> 06:05.265
Yeah, go ahead.

06:05.365 --> 06:07.668
Come on, Beck.

06:07.768 --> 06:10.704
Well, Mark and I are
getting along really good now.

06:10.804 --> 06:14.207
And I know you guys
aren't crazy about him.

06:14.307 --> 06:16.477
But he got to admit,
he's trying really hard.

06:19.913 --> 06:20.714
OK.

06:24.685 --> 06:26.286
Well, I was
thinking, you know.

06:29.189 --> 06:36.129
Just in case we decide
to, that it's time for me

06:36.229 --> 06:39.700
to get some birth control.

06:59.252 --> 07:04.892
Isn't that great,
Roseanne, that Becky has such

07:04.992 --> 07:09.062
a wonderful, progressive,
open minded mom that she

07:09.162 --> 07:10.698
can talk to about that?

07:18.672 --> 07:19.473
Uh huh.

07:22.142 --> 07:25.479
Well, I was going
to go to a clinic.

07:25.579 --> 07:29.249
But Jackie thought that maybe
I should go and see your--

07:29.349 --> 07:30.450
gyno--
- Gynocologist.

07:30.551 --> 07:31.485
Gynocologist.

07:34.354 --> 07:36.757
Uh huh.

07:36.857 --> 07:37.658
Really?

07:37.758 --> 07:39.860
so this is OK with you?

07:39.960 --> 07:42.563
Uh huh.

07:42.663 --> 07:43.631
You're kidding.

07:43.731 --> 07:44.932
I can't believe how
great you're being.

07:45.032 --> 07:46.767
I'm so glad Jackie
made me tell you.

07:46.867 --> 07:49.402
Roseanne, I thought
that we should take her.

07:49.503 --> 07:51.872
Oh, sure.

07:51.972 --> 07:54.374
Sure, we'll take her.

07:54.474 --> 07:55.776
Oh, great!

07:55.876 --> 07:57.077
I'm so glad I told her.

07:57.177 --> 07:58.812
Thank you so much!

07:58.912 --> 08:01.214
Thank you so much!

08:01.314 --> 08:02.115
Oh, boy.

08:08.088 --> 08:09.957
This is a good thing, Roseanne.

08:10.057 --> 08:11.959
Are you crazy?

08:12.059 --> 08:13.827
She wants me to take her
to get birth control?

08:13.927 --> 08:14.728
That's a good thing?

08:14.828 --> 08:15.796
You need to sit down?

08:15.896 --> 08:16.930
No, Jackie.

08:17.030 --> 08:21.268
No, I need to lay down
in a great big pine box.

08:21.368 --> 08:23.236
She came to you.

08:23.336 --> 08:24.772
She confided in you.

08:24.872 --> 08:26.006
She trusts you.

08:26.106 --> 08:27.741
That's like good thing.

08:27.841 --> 08:29.076
I cannot handle this.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.744
- Yeah, you can.
- I can't do this.

08:30.844 --> 08:31.645
Of course you can.

08:31.745 --> 08:32.546
No, I know.

08:32.646 --> 08:33.881
I know I can't do this.

08:33.981 --> 08:37.250
[baby crying]

08:43.156 --> 08:45.092
I can do this.

08:45.192 --> 08:47.961
[music playing]

08:50.463 --> 08:52.299
Hey,Dad.

08:52.399 --> 08:53.266
Hey, guys, how was lunch?

08:53.366 --> 08:55.468
It was cool.

08:55.569 --> 08:57.337
Is it ever not cool, Mark?

09:00.908 --> 09:03.076
So what time are you
picking me up tonight?

09:03.176 --> 09:04.544
Around 8, I guess.

09:09.883 --> 09:11.685
Love you.

09:11.785 --> 09:14.187
Yeah, me, too.

09:14.287 --> 09:15.122
Bye, Dad.

09:15.222 --> 09:16.023
Yeah.

09:20.560 --> 09:24.698
So lunch was good?

09:24.798 --> 09:25.599
Yep.

09:28.836 --> 09:30.871
What did you eat?

09:30.971 --> 09:31.772
Tacos.

09:31.872 --> 09:32.673
Ah.

09:35.709 --> 09:36.476
Mexican.

09:40.614 --> 09:42.983
Well, the bike's back there.

09:43.083 --> 09:43.884
Ah, a customer.

09:43.984 --> 09:45.452
I'll be out front.

09:45.552 --> 09:46.353
Cool.

09:50.323 --> 09:51.391
Hey, Rosie.

09:51.491 --> 09:52.926
I brought you some
lunch from the restaurant.

09:53.026 --> 09:54.527
Ah, smells good.

09:54.628 --> 09:56.229
Yeah,I don't know why
the guy didn't finish it.

09:59.066 --> 10:00.467
How's it going?

10:00.567 --> 10:03.103
Cool.

10:03.203 --> 10:04.304
Oh, Yeah.

10:04.404 --> 10:06.707
Hi there, Mark.

10:06.807 --> 10:09.409
Hey.

10:09.509 --> 10:11.378
- You just missed Becky.
- Well, that's OK.

10:11.478 --> 10:12.579
I'll see her later.

10:12.680 --> 10:14.748
Well, thanks for
the lunch, hon.

10:14.848 --> 10:15.883
I'm going to get back.

10:15.983 --> 10:16.784
Uh, Dan.

10:22.055 --> 10:23.724
We have to talk.

10:23.824 --> 10:27.027
I don't want to know.

10:27.127 --> 10:28.628
Well, you have to
know, because I'm

10:28.729 --> 10:30.197
not going to know this alone.

10:30.297 --> 10:32.199
What?

10:32.299 --> 10:35.535
Becky wants me to take her
and get her some birth control.

10:42.475 --> 10:44.344
Where are you going?

10:44.444 --> 10:48.281
Oh, I'm going to kill Mark.

10:48.381 --> 10:52.152
He's in the back, so I have
to go in the back to kill him.

10:52.252 --> 10:53.153
Come on.

10:53.253 --> 10:55.622
Well. we can't
just let this happen.

10:55.723 --> 10:56.990
Well, I don't want
it to happen either.

10:57.090 --> 10:59.092
But I mean if it
is going to happen,

10:59.192 --> 11:00.728
I don't want our daughter
getting her birth

11:00.828 --> 11:02.796
control out of the mess
room at the Chevron station

11:02.896 --> 11:05.132
like we used to.

11:05.232 --> 11:06.099
What are we supposed to do?

11:06.199 --> 11:07.735
Put on Sinatra,
fluff up the pillows

11:07.835 --> 11:09.737
and turn down the lights?

11:09.837 --> 11:11.204
Like they listened to Sinatra.

11:14.041 --> 11:18.111
She's 17, Dan, I don't think
there is much we can do.

11:18.211 --> 11:19.947
You're not even going to
tried to talk her out of it.

11:20.047 --> 11:20.781
Well, if course
I'm going to try.

11:20.881 --> 11:22.182
I'm going to try my butt off.

11:22.282 --> 11:23.616
But I'm not going to go blowing
up at her and neither are you.

11:23.717 --> 11:25.152
You want me to act
like nothing's going on?

11:25.252 --> 11:26.053
Yeah.

11:26.153 --> 11:27.487
Because if we go
crazy with this,

11:27.587 --> 11:29.857
she's not going to
trust me with anything.

11:29.957 --> 11:31.258
And it's better
that she comes to us

11:31.358 --> 11:35.495
rather than learning everything
from Johnny Hormone back there.

11:35.595 --> 11:37.898
Oh, man.

11:37.998 --> 11:39.699
he's just going to
come walking in here

11:39.800 --> 11:42.702
all innocent, like
nothing happened.

11:42.803 --> 11:44.637
Yeah, well, you know
that that's the way

11:44.738 --> 11:47.274
you played it with my dad.

11:47.374 --> 11:49.877
Oh, God, I forgot about that.

11:49.977 --> 11:51.378
Suddenly, I feel like
calling up your father

11:51.478 --> 11:56.016
and apologizing to him for ever
having sex with his daughter.

11:56.116 --> 11:57.650
Oh, that's okay, Dan.

11:57.751 --> 12:00.253
It's enough that
you've apologized to me

12:01.354 --> 12:05.158
[music playing]

12:06.760 --> 12:09.096
[music playing]

12:14.902 --> 12:15.702
Mrs. Addison?

12:20.307 --> 12:22.709
Any diabetes in our family?

12:22.810 --> 12:24.077
No.

12:24.177 --> 12:24.978
Ulcers?

12:25.078 --> 12:26.179
No.

12:26.279 --> 12:27.047
History of migraine?

12:31.518 --> 12:32.619
No.

12:32.719 --> 12:35.956
this is my first one.

12:36.056 --> 12:37.925
I wish she'd just give me
the pills instead of putting me

12:38.025 --> 12:40.127
through this whole exam thing.

12:40.227 --> 12:41.328
Oh, don't worry
about it, Becky.

12:41.428 --> 12:43.496
Just make sure you
keep your socks on.

12:43.596 --> 12:44.998
Oh, there's a good look.

12:45.098 --> 12:46.766
A paper dress and socks.

12:49.269 --> 12:50.070
NURSE: Becky Conner.

12:50.170 --> 12:52.339
Thank God.

12:52.439 --> 12:53.240
Honey!

13:00.247 --> 13:01.048
Go get 'em.

13:11.892 --> 13:14.261
Go get 'em?

13:14.361 --> 13:15.762
I want to say a
whole bunch of stuff,

13:15.863 --> 13:17.364
like stop, you're too young.
You know?

13:17.464 --> 13:18.265
I know.

13:18.365 --> 13:19.366
The only thing
I can think to--

13:19.466 --> 13:20.067
I know, I know--

13:20.167 --> 13:21.034
Talk about is socks.

13:21.134 --> 13:23.470
You're doing--
you're doing great.

13:23.570 --> 13:25.072
I don't believe this, Jackie.

13:25.172 --> 13:26.206
I drive her down here.

13:26.306 --> 13:27.307
And I make the appointment.

13:27.407 --> 13:30.810
Well, Becky's
very, very lucky.

13:30.911 --> 13:33.280
What are people
going to say, Jackie?

13:33.380 --> 13:35.348
So who's going to know?

13:35.448 --> 13:36.850
She's going to
tell all her friends.

13:36.950 --> 13:39.286
And then her friends
will tell their moms.

13:39.386 --> 13:41.688
Mrs. Conner lets Becky have sex.

13:41.788 --> 13:45.158
Well, Roseanne--

13:45.258 --> 13:46.659
She's all grown up, Jackie.

13:46.759 --> 13:49.496
Oh, don't say it.

13:49.596 --> 13:51.031
She doesn't need me anymore.

13:51.131 --> 13:52.765
Oh, of course she does.

13:52.866 --> 13:53.867
She needs you.

13:56.703 --> 13:58.471
She needs you to
pay for the pills.

[music playing]

14:29.669 --> 14:31.038
[electric tool noise]

14:37.777 --> 14:39.046
Something I can do
for you, Mr. Conner?

14:39.146 --> 14:40.313
No.

14:40.413 --> 14:42.249
No, I'm cool.

14:50.123 --> 14:52.359
What is this doing here?

14:52.459 --> 14:53.626
I was using it.

14:53.726 --> 14:56.229
Using it.

14:56.329 --> 14:57.797
Is that how you treat my wrench?

14:57.897 --> 15:01.201
You use it?

15:01.301 --> 15:04.804
And then you toss it aside
into a puddle of grease.

15:04.904 --> 15:05.705
Sorry.

15:05.805 --> 15:08.075
This wrench was brand new.

15:08.175 --> 15:10.610
Never even been touched.

15:10.710 --> 15:12.412
You yanked it out
of the shrink wrap,

15:12.512 --> 15:14.181
did god knows what with
it, and just going to leave

15:14.281 --> 15:17.617
it laying there just like that.

15:17.717 --> 15:18.718
I was going to use it again?

15:18.818 --> 15:20.753
No, no, buddy.

15:20.853 --> 15:22.956
See, I don't care
what you do with all

15:23.056 --> 15:24.857
your other little wrenches,
but this is my wrench.

15:28.395 --> 15:30.597
And I want it returned to me
in exactly the same condition

15:30.697 --> 15:31.498
you found it in?

15:31.598 --> 15:32.399
You got that, Mark.

15:32.499 --> 15:33.333
Is that clear?

15:33.433 --> 15:35.502
Is that cool?

15:35.602 --> 15:36.569
Excuse me.

[music playing]

[phone ringing]

15:51.918 --> 15:54.287
Hello.

15:54.387 --> 15:56.289
Oh, yeah, hold on, Mark.

15:56.389 --> 16:00.527
Becky, Zippy's on the phone.

16:00.627 --> 16:06.166
So Mark did you telephone
yourself or did daddy help you?

16:06.266 --> 16:07.067
Oh, no.

16:07.167 --> 16:09.136
That's not very nice.

16:09.236 --> 16:11.104
Do you use that filthy
mouth to kiss my sister?

16:14.574 --> 16:15.908
Give me the phone, Darlene.

16:16.009 --> 16:17.244
Let me just say goodbye.

16:17.344 --> 16:18.745
[burps]

16:27.687 --> 16:31.324
Come on, I mean, we're
supposed to pick me up at 8:00.

16:31.424 --> 16:34.294
Yeah.

16:34.394 --> 16:36.029
OK.

16:36.129 --> 16:38.365
Yeah, tomorrow night.

16:38.465 --> 16:39.332
I love you.
Yeah.

16:39.432 --> 16:40.233
Bye.

16:44.704 --> 16:45.805
I can't believe it.

16:45.905 --> 16:47.407
Dad's got him up on the
roof cleaning the gutters.

16:50.077 --> 16:52.412
But what about your date?

16:52.512 --> 16:54.181
It's off.

16:54.281 --> 16:56.649
Oh, honey.

16:56.749 --> 17:00.553
Now what am I going
to do all night?

17:00.653 --> 17:04.424
Well, I've got an idea.

17:04.524 --> 17:06.526
Why don't we make
like a ton of popcorn,

17:06.626 --> 17:07.927
you know, and then we watch TV.

17:08.027 --> 17:11.198
And we'll have a little
chat, just me and you.

17:11.298 --> 17:13.366
OK.

17:13.466 --> 17:17.370
Let's go see what we want.

17:17.470 --> 17:18.805
Hm, cheddar cheese.

17:18.905 --> 17:21.841
You got it.

17:21.941 --> 17:22.875
How's your headache?

17:22.975 --> 17:24.544
Oh, it's better.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.546
Now it's just a
crippling, blinding thing.

17:26.646 --> 17:27.447
No biggie.

17:29.449 --> 17:30.250
Sorry.

17:33.986 --> 17:39.326
Becky, I kind of wanted to
talk to you about all this.

17:39.426 --> 17:43.062
And I was wondering
if, you know, you--

17:43.163 --> 17:45.398
you've thought about everything.

17:45.498 --> 17:47.234
You mean about the pill.

17:47.334 --> 17:51.138
Yeah, that and other stuff.

17:51.238 --> 17:52.205
Like?

17:52.305 --> 17:54.274
You do know that
you don't have to have

17:54.374 --> 17:55.542
sex just to have a boyfriend.

17:55.642 --> 17:57.610
I know.

17:57.710 --> 17:59.011
I mean, even though
some of your friends

17:59.112 --> 18:01.914
might be having sex and filling
your head with all these lies

18:02.014 --> 18:04.917
about how good it is.

18:05.017 --> 18:07.854
I know.

18:07.954 --> 18:10.457
I was just thinking that,
you know, I mean you're young.

18:10.557 --> 18:13.626
And maybe you should wait.

18:13.726 --> 18:15.128
I mean, this is like
a really big step.

18:15.228 --> 18:16.028
I know, Mom.

18:16.129 --> 18:17.164
I've thought about this.

18:19.799 --> 18:20.800
Well, I just--

18:20.900 --> 18:22.169
I just wanted to bring it up.

18:22.269 --> 18:23.503
OK.

18:23.603 --> 18:28.408
Uh, you know, though, you've
got a while to think about

18:28.508 --> 18:30.610
it some more and
maybe even reconsider,

18:30.710 --> 18:33.713
because, you know, the pill
doesn't kick in for like, what?

18:33.813 --> 18:34.614
A whole month.

18:42.955 --> 18:43.823
Mom.

18:43.923 --> 18:44.724
Yeah?

18:49.329 --> 18:50.129
What?

18:53.200 --> 18:55.535
We already--

19:04.043 --> 19:05.645
Already?

19:05.745 --> 19:06.646
I really wanted to tell you.

19:06.746 --> 19:07.814
But I thought you'd be mad.

19:10.817 --> 19:12.219
Already?

19:12.319 --> 19:13.119
Don't worry, Mom.

19:13.220 --> 19:15.087
We used something.

19:15.188 --> 19:17.324
You already used some?

19:17.424 --> 19:18.225
Yeah.

19:18.325 --> 19:19.125
Kind of.

19:19.226 --> 19:21.127
For diseases and stuff.

19:21.228 --> 19:22.529
I just thought of
having the pill would be

19:22.629 --> 19:24.397
like extra, extra protection.

19:27.900 --> 19:28.701
Mom?

19:28.801 --> 19:29.636
Yeah, good thinking.

19:29.736 --> 19:30.503
Yeah., yeah.

19:34.341 --> 19:35.675
Is there anything else
that I need to know.

19:35.775 --> 19:37.677
No.

19:37.777 --> 19:40.647
I know every single thing
that there is to know, right?

19:40.747 --> 19:41.748
- Yeah.
- Swear to God?

19:41.848 --> 19:42.649
Yeah.

19:46.085 --> 19:48.355
OK.

19:48.455 --> 19:51.258
Well, I'm going to put
the cheese on the popcorn,

19:51.358 --> 19:53.493
so you go get something on TV.

19:53.593 --> 19:55.995
OK.

19:56.095 --> 19:57.797
listen, Mom, this is
between us, right?

19:57.897 --> 19:59.699
You're not going to go
tell Dad or anything?

20:03.002 --> 20:04.170
Well, not if you
don't want me to.

20:07.974 --> 20:09.742
Love you, Mom.

20:09.842 --> 20:10.710
Yeah.

20:10.810 --> 20:12.745
Yeah, love you, too.

20:15.715 --> 20:16.649
Mom, let go.

20:19.652 --> 20:21.020
In a couple years.

20:32.332 --> 20:41.908
OK, once upon a time, in
a perfect fairytale world,

20:42.008 --> 20:46.546
there lived in the princess
and her beautiful mother,

20:46.646 --> 20:48.648
the all knowing queen,
who was even more

20:48.748 --> 20:51.351
beautiful than the princess.

20:51.451 --> 20:53.219
And one day, the
princess decided

20:53.320 --> 20:58.190
that she was going to have
sex with an ugly creepy

20:58.291 --> 21:00.360
little ogre named, Cool.

21:03.663 --> 21:05.665
Scary.

21:05.765 --> 21:07.567
Aw.

21:07.667 --> 21:10.937
But that's OK, because the
Queen talked to the princess.

21:11.037 --> 21:14.073
And she told her, she
must never ever have sex.

21:14.173 --> 21:16.743
And the princess agreed.

21:16.843 --> 21:25.017
So the queen, the princess,
and the ignorant old King

21:25.117 --> 21:30.256
lived happily ever after in
a totally sex free world.

21:30.357 --> 21:32.459
What happened to Cool?

21:32.559 --> 21:34.894
Oh, it was horrible.

21:34.994 --> 21:37.096
He died a hideous
and grotesque death

21:37.196 --> 21:40.032
when something very sharp
and heavy and medieval

21:40.132 --> 21:42.101
fell upon his head.

21:42.201 --> 21:44.437
[clapping]
