00:00.993 --> 00:03.094
<i>Previously on</i> Bones...

00:07.294 --> 00:09.462
He was a good man.
He was gonna make it.

00:09.496 --> 00:11.564
BOOTH: So everyone in
here has done time?

00:11.598 --> 00:14.033
Yeah. I told you my guys
had nothing to do with this.

00:14.068 --> 00:16.369
Oh, three more bodies.

00:16.403 --> 00:18.037
The bodies burned for
different amounts of time.

00:18.072 --> 00:19.605
SAROYAN: <i>That and the creepy</i>
<i>removal of the tattoos.</i>

00:19.640 --> 00:22.809
<i>I'm calling this</i>
<i>a serial killer.</i>

00:22.843 --> 00:24.744
There appear to be
symmetrical curve marks

00:24.778 --> 00:27.180
through the clavicles
and the upper thorax.

00:27.214 --> 00:28.247
Just like Freeman.

00:28.282 --> 00:29.348
These killings could have

00:29.383 --> 00:31.117
a ritualistic component.

00:31.151 --> 00:34.193
We found three more bodies where
Connor was being held captive.

00:34.390 --> 00:37.212
Two of them
had connections to Rockwell,

00:37.213 --> 00:38.484
one we're still waiting on.

00:38.485 --> 00:40.519
Listen to me, Alex, if you run,
they're not gonna believe you.

00:40.554 --> 00:42.588
You need to talk to them now.
Rockwell?

00:42.622 --> 00:44.256
He has a knife in the car!

00:44.291 --> 00:46.225
I don't have a clear shot.
I do.

00:46.259 --> 00:47.359
(grunts)

00:49.596 --> 00:51.564
Booth.

01:06.839 --> 01:08.806
Rockwell?

01:11.477 --> 01:14.746
How you doing?

01:17.616 --> 01:20.651
You decided what you want
for your last meal request?

01:22.521 --> 01:25.256
I'll eat whatever the kitchen
is serving the other inmates.

01:25.290 --> 01:27.892
Aw. They'll make
whatever you want.

01:32.564 --> 01:34.599
Final 48 hours are approaching.

01:34.633 --> 01:37.869
Means you get one visit
with your family and a priest,

01:37.903 --> 01:39.904
but you got to fill out
this form first.

01:39.938 --> 01:41.205
I know the rules.

01:41.240 --> 01:43.608
I have no family and no priest.

01:43.642 --> 01:46.377
They gave up on me
a long time ago.

01:48.347 --> 01:50.581
Listen.

01:50.616 --> 01:53.151
The warden can assign you
a chaplain if you want one...

01:53.185 --> 01:54.552
I need nothing, thanks.

01:54.586 --> 01:56.687
I'm all I need.

02:15.140 --> 02:16.574
(knocking)

02:16.608 --> 02:18.276
Look, Bones, this is, like,
the fourth message

02:18.310 --> 02:20.044
that I've left you
already, all right?

02:20.078 --> 02:21.579
So just do me a favor.

02:21.613 --> 02:23.448
I'm getting just a little
worried right now, okay?

02:23.482 --> 02:26.217
So, you get this message,
I want you to call me

02:26.251 --> 02:27.718
or text me, got it?

02:27.753 --> 02:29.153
Well, this is
a big honor.

02:29.188 --> 02:31.389
Being invited to
Sunday dinner.

02:31.423 --> 02:33.191
Everything okay?

02:33.225 --> 02:35.193
Bones was supposed
to be home hours ago.

02:35.227 --> 02:36.894
She's been at the lab
all weekend long

02:36.929 --> 02:39.397
going over her findings
from the Alex Rockwell case.

02:39.431 --> 02:40.998
Why? I mean, that was
seven months ago.

02:41.033 --> 02:42.600
And she got
a conviction.

02:42.634 --> 02:44.101
Well, it's her process
before anyone is executed.

02:44.136 --> 02:46.637
You know?
She has to look at her work.

02:46.672 --> 02:48.639
So Rockwell didn't
file for an appeal?

02:48.674 --> 02:50.141
No, not at all.

02:50.175 --> 02:52.343
He even aske$ to move up
the execution date.

02:52.377 --> 02:54.779
Well, if that doesn't say
guilty, I don't know what does.

02:54.813 --> 02:56.147
CHRISTINE:
I'm starving.

02:56.181 --> 02:58.115
If I don't eat soon, I'll die.

02:58.150 --> 03:00.251
BOOTH:
Right. Coming up!

03:00.285 --> 03:03.654
Hey, what if I
sneak you a snack?

03:03.689 --> 03:06.624
Seriously? You carry
snacks in your pocket?

03:06.658 --> 03:09.861
Uh, yeah, in case of
emergencies like this one.

03:09.895 --> 03:12.296
I don't think my mom
would want me eating those.

03:12.331 --> 03:13.931
No, I'll tell you what-- she
wouldn't want you eating those.

03:13.966 --> 03:15.566
That's a good choi...
She's not picking up.

03:15.601 --> 03:16.868
Okay, Christine,
you know what?

03:16.902 --> 03:18.903
Field trip time.
Let's go get Mom.

03:18.937 --> 03:20.471
But I'm hungry!

03:20.506 --> 03:23.241
You know, if you want, I
can watch the mini-Booth.

03:23.275 --> 03:24.375
What? I mean,

03:24.409 --> 03:25.643
I'm closer to her in age.

03:25.677 --> 03:27.211
We'll have plenty
to talk about.

03:27.246 --> 03:28.980
Go, go. It's fine.
I'm good with the kids.

03:29.014 --> 03:30.548
Come on, Christine and
I will be fine, right?

03:30.582 --> 03:31.816
Okay.

03:31.850 --> 03:33.084
Listen to me then, all right?

03:33.118 --> 03:34.785
I don't want you
eating any of these.

03:34.820 --> 03:36.787
No sugar. Broccoli
only, all right?

03:36.822 --> 03:39.323
You hear me? Broccoli.

03:41.527 --> 03:44.161
Can I see those
gummy bears again?

03:51.870 --> 03:53.437
Dr. Brennan.

03:53.472 --> 03:55.172
It's late.
You shouldn't be here.

03:55.207 --> 03:57.942
He has osteophytes
on both coracoid processes.

03:57.976 --> 03:59.977
It makes no sense.

04:00.012 --> 04:01.445
Are you okay?

04:01.480 --> 04:03.548
No, I-I don't
believe I am.

04:03.582 --> 04:04.682
Is it the baby?

04:04.716 --> 04:05.716
What? The baby?

04:05.717 --> 04:07.852
No. The baby's fine.

04:07.886 --> 04:09.554
Look at these.

04:09.588 --> 04:11.088
What am I looking at?

04:11.123 --> 04:12.857
Our murderer!

04:12.891 --> 04:15.826
These are Alex Rockwell's
humeral heads and scapulas.

04:15.861 --> 04:18.529
There is increased
bone growth around

04:18.564 --> 04:20.697
the glenoid fossa
of the right scapula

04:20.732 --> 04:23.367
and osteophytes
on both coracoid processes.

04:23.402 --> 04:25.169
Okay, Alex Rockwell

04:25.203 --> 04:27.672
had untreated rotator cuff
injuries in both shoulders.

04:27.706 --> 04:29.607
And they're over
ten years old.

04:29.641 --> 04:31.909
I'm sorry, I don't get
the cause for alarm.

04:31.944 --> 04:33.778
Because he's going
to be executed.

04:33.812 --> 04:36.547
And there's no way he could've
killed Leonard Barnes.

04:36.582 --> 04:37.715
He wasn't tried
for Barnes' murder.

04:37.749 --> 04:39.050
Only the other three.
Caroline...

04:39.084 --> 04:40.351
I know.
The evidence for Barnes

04:40.385 --> 04:42.119
was older than
the others, but...

04:42.154 --> 04:43.588
Bones, wait a sec,
what are you still doing here?

04:43.622 --> 04:44.956
You were supposed
to be home hours ago.

04:44.990 --> 04:46.490
I need to find
Leonard Barnes' file.

04:46.525 --> 04:48.292
Barnes?
He was Rockwell's first victim.

04:48.327 --> 04:50.261
We found him with the others
at the ironworks factory.

04:50.295 --> 04:52.196
I know who he is.
Why are we looking for his file?

04:52.230 --> 04:55.166
Because I don't think Alex
Rockwell is our serial killer.

04:55.200 --> 04:57.168
Hold it right there, okay?
He was convicted

04:57.202 --> 04:59.437
off of your evidence
and your testimony.

04:59.471 --> 05:01.339
SAROYAN: Dr. Brennan, how long
has it been since you slept?

05:01.373 --> 05:03.341
You're pregnant.
Maybe the stress...

05:03.375 --> 05:04.875
Yes, I am pregnant, Dr. Saroyan.

05:04.910 --> 05:07.645
But that in no way compromises
my mental acumen.

05:07.679 --> 05:08.879
I am making sense, Booth.

05:08.914 --> 05:10.247
I found her like this

05:10.282 --> 05:11.642
poring over Alex
Rockwell's X-rays.

05:11.650 --> 05:13.551
BOOTH:
His X-rays?

05:13.585 --> 05:15.453
What are we doing
with Rockwell's X-rays?

05:15.487 --> 05:17.021
They were taken by the prison
doctor after he got into a fight

05:17.055 --> 05:19.223
a few months ago.
And they confirm

05:19.257 --> 05:21.225
that he couldn't have killed
Leonard Barnes.

05:21.259 --> 05:24.261
Barnes sustained blunt force
trauma to his left parietal

05:24.296 --> 05:27.131
and spinous processes
of the L1 through L5

05:27.165 --> 05:28.766
from someone swinging a pipe

05:28.800 --> 05:30.768
from a high angle
in a downward motion.

05:30.802 --> 05:32.803
Oh, my God.
BOOTH: Okay, look, everyone just...

05:32.838 --> 05:34.505
someone, please tell me
what's going on.

05:34.539 --> 05:36.507
This case was a slam dunk.

05:36.541 --> 05:39.010
BRENNAN: Alex Rockwell's
rotator cuff injuries.

05:39.044 --> 05:41.045
He would've been
incapable of meeting

05:41.079 --> 05:43.547
the force profile required
to beat Leonard Barnes to death.

05:43.582 --> 05:45.282
SAROYAN:
All the victims,

05:45.317 --> 05:47.585
including Barnes, had
that same ritualistic

05:47.619 --> 05:50.187
triangle carved into the
tissue of their upper chests.

05:50.222 --> 05:52.123
All their DNA was
found on the knife

05:52.157 --> 05:54.525
in Alex's car-- I-I ran
the tests myself.

05:54.559 --> 05:56.761
BOOTH: Okay, if Rockwell
didn't kill Barnes, then

05:56.795 --> 05:59.630
it's possible he didn't kill
any of the victims we found.

05:59.665 --> 06:03.300
Which means... they could be
executing an innocent man.

06:05.203 --> 06:08.105

You three are responsible
for the conviction

06:50.256 --> 06:51.823
of Alex Rockwell,

06:51.858 --> 06:53.625
and now you're asking me
to stay his execution?

06:53.659 --> 06:54.726
BRENNAN:
Yes.

06:54.760 --> 06:55.894
Or at least just postpone it

06:55.928 --> 06:57.329
till we get to the bottom

06:57.363 --> 06:58.697
We did get to the
bottom of it,

06:58.731 --> 07:00.365
several months
ago in court.

07:00.399 --> 07:03.401
You consulted with the D.A.
prosecuting Rockwell,

07:03.436 --> 07:05.804
Ms. Julian. Why are
you wasting my time?

07:05.838 --> 07:07.105
CAROLINE: I trust

07:07.139 --> 07:08.740
If they say
something's hinky,

07:08.774 --> 07:10.375
then something's hinky.

07:10.409 --> 07:12.744
The last time I looked,
hinky was not a legal strategy.

07:12.778 --> 07:14.913
Listen, I haven't had
breakfast yet, so...

07:14.947 --> 07:16.815
The blows to Leonard Barnes
could not...

07:16.849 --> 07:17.849
Wait, wait, wait.

07:17.884 --> 07:19.751
Leonard Barnes?

07:19.785 --> 07:23.088
Alex Rockwell wasn't even
tried for Barnes' murder.

07:23.122 --> 07:24.689
Right, but the four murders
were linked.

07:24.724 --> 07:26.258
I mean, look,
if Rockwell didn't kill Barnes,

07:26.292 --> 07:27.726
it's likely he didn't
kill any of them.

07:27.760 --> 07:28.860
"Likely," "hinky."

07:28.895 --> 07:30.262
What's next-- "maybe"?

07:30.296 --> 07:32.764
Leonard Barnes is
not relevant.

07:32.798 --> 07:34.799
Alex Rockwell is being executed
for the murders

07:34.834 --> 07:38.103
of Father Douglas Nabors,
Ted Widmer and Connor Freeman.

07:38.137 --> 07:39.337
But those...
No, no, no.

07:39.372 --> 07:41.640
No more theories,
Dr. Brennan.

07:41.674 --> 07:42.974
Do you have
conclusive evidence

07:43.009 --> 07:44.576
that would overturn
his conviction?

07:44.610 --> 07:46.645
Not yet.
You know, we just... we just need more time.

07:46.679 --> 07:47.679
Sorry, kids,

07:47.713 --> 07:49.614
I have no legal grounds

07:49.649 --> 07:51.550
to postpone this execution.

07:51.584 --> 07:55.120
I can provide the evidence
if I can re-examine the remains.

07:56.322 --> 07:58.590
You want to exhume four bodies?

07:58.624 --> 08:00.659
How else would I be able
to re-examine the remains?

08:00.693 --> 08:03.728
BOOTH: Please, just
give us this one.

08:03.763 --> 08:07.265
You don't want an innocent man's
death on your head, do you?

08:07.300 --> 08:09.568
Cute.

08:09.602 --> 08:12.537
Any objection from
the Justice Department?

08:12.572 --> 08:15.140
I have no objection.

08:16.442 --> 08:18.977
All right, I will sign
an exhumation order.

08:19.011 --> 08:20.645
But I don't want
to see any of you

08:20.680 --> 08:22.113
in my chambers again

08:22.148 --> 08:26.117
until you have
concrete evidence.

08:27.687 --> 08:30.388
Angela's particle scanner uses
similar technology

08:30.423 --> 08:33.091
to what was used
to read through the layers

08:33.125 --> 08:35.659
of the Herculaneum
charred scrolls.

08:35.695 --> 08:38.563
Yeah, think of it
as a high-pressure X-ray.

08:38.597 --> 08:40.131
It should be able to determine

08:40.166 --> 08:41.499
the force applied
to these fractures,

08:41.534 --> 08:43.735
and hopefully prove
Brennan's theory.

08:43.769 --> 08:46.037
I can't believe your country
still executes prisoners.

08:46.072 --> 08:47.739
I believe it's
your country now, too.

08:47.773 --> 08:50.008
Yeah, and if you want to prevent
the death of an innocent man,

08:50.042 --> 08:52.177
I suggest you familiarize
yourself with these case files.

08:52.211 --> 08:53.478
BRENNAN:
And the 824

08:53.512 --> 08:56.281
bones before you,
because Mr. Rockwell

08:56.315 --> 09:00.218
will be dead in 36 hours
and 16 minutes.

09:00.252 --> 09:01.786
FUENTES: So, based
on time of death,

09:01.821 --> 09:03.822
Leonard Barnes was
the very first victim.

09:03.856 --> 09:05.824
SAROYAN: Which explains why that
murder was the most violent.

09:05.858 --> 09:07.258
Our killer hadn't
honed his skills yet.

09:07.293 --> 09:08.773
FUENTES: And all the
remaining victims

09:08.794 --> 09:10.462
were then killed
in a similar manner.

09:10.496 --> 09:12.297
But the jugular
veins were more

09:12.331 --> 09:14.299
expertly severed.
BRENNAN: Except for Connor Freeman,

09:14.333 --> 09:17.502
who escaped and died
in the mine explosion.

09:17.536 --> 09:18.570
MONTENEGRO:
Okay.

09:18.604 --> 09:19.971
That should do it.

09:20.006 --> 09:22.107
I'm gonna load this
in the Angelatron.

09:22.141 --> 09:23.875
My God.

09:23.909 --> 09:26.277
You okay there, buddy?

09:26.312 --> 09:30.382
All these victims were tortured
and left to slowly bleed out.

09:30.416 --> 09:31.583
I can never understand

09:31.617 --> 09:33.318
how somebody could do
something like this.

09:33.352 --> 09:37.188
Let's hope we figure out
who it is before it's too late.

09:43.029 --> 09:45.296
So why have we brought in
Thomas Saltz?

09:45.331 --> 09:47.165
Well, if Rockwell didn't do
it, then somebody planted

09:47.199 --> 09:49.034
the murder weapon
in his car, right?

09:49.068 --> 09:51.536
Saltz-- he worked with
him at the bakery,

09:51.570 --> 09:53.204
borrowed his car
all the time.

09:53.239 --> 09:54.472
Giving Saltz means
and opportunity

09:54.507 --> 09:56.041
to plant evidence in the car.

09:56.075 --> 09:57.275
Look, during the trial,
Rockwell's lawyer

09:57.309 --> 09:58.543
tried to drum up
reasonable doubt

09:58.577 --> 10:00.245
by pointing the finger
at Thomas Saltz.

10:00.279 --> 10:02.180
So maybe it was more
than reasonable doubt?

10:02.214 --> 10:04.683
We're gonna
find out, huh?

10:04.717 --> 10:06.384
The jury
convicted Alex.

10:06.419 --> 10:08.586
Man, I had nothing to
do with those murders.

10:08.621 --> 10:11.523
Well, we have reason to believe
that Alex may be innocent.

10:11.557 --> 10:13.425
So you think I did it instead?
Borrowed his car

10:13.459 --> 10:14.893
a few times a week, didn't you?

10:14.927 --> 10:16.227
So?
So it would've been real easy for you

10:16.262 --> 10:17.996
to stash the murder
weapon in it.

10:18.030 --> 10:20.331
Look, I borrowed his car to go
to my N.A. meetings.

10:20.366 --> 10:21.800
Ah, look at that.

10:21.834 --> 10:23.802
N.A.-- Narcotics Anonymous.
That's good.

10:23.836 --> 10:25.870
Right? Now we're
getting somewhere.

10:25.905 --> 10:28.540
Look, I'm clean.
You can ask my sponsor.

10:28.574 --> 10:30.241
Why would I kill all those
people? I've never even had

10:30.276 --> 10:32.343
an assault conviction.
You had a connection

10:32.378 --> 10:34.045
to at least two of the victims.

10:34.080 --> 10:35.980
Yeah.
Two of your prison mates there,

10:36.015 --> 10:37.816
Widmer and Freeman.

10:37.850 --> 10:39.751
Plus, we know that
Father Nabors visited Alex

10:39.785 --> 10:41.286
at the bakery, tried to
get him back to church.

10:41.320 --> 10:42.787
You were friends with Alex;

10:42.822 --> 10:44.222
maybe you didn't like
the idea of losing him.

10:44.256 --> 10:45.824
SALTZ:
That's crazy.

10:45.858 --> 10:47.726
What's crazy?
The night Connor was killed,

10:47.760 --> 10:49.861
I was at one of
my N.A. meetings.

10:49.895 --> 10:52.363
I go to the same meeting
every week.

10:52.398 --> 10:54.599
You can check.

10:57.870 --> 11:00.138
FUENTES:
<i>All the damage I'm seeing</i>

11:00.172 --> 11:02.440
<i>is already listed</i>
<i>in the case files.</i>

11:07.446 --> 11:08.847
It <i>is</i> new.

11:08.881 --> 11:11.216
What is it, Dr. Fuentes?
Right there.

11:11.250 --> 11:13.785
A faint, curved striation
toward the medial end

11:13.819 --> 11:16.588
of Father Nabor's left clavicle,
further in than the kerf mark.

11:16.622 --> 11:18.022
Do any of the
other victims

11:18.057 --> 11:19.991
have that same striation
on their clavicle?

11:20.025 --> 11:21.760
Not that I saw,
but some of these remains

11:21.794 --> 11:23.628
are extremely damaged
by the fire.

11:23.662 --> 11:27.132
Perhaps Angela's scans
will see something else.

11:27.166 --> 11:30.001
I hope, because this could just
be Rockwell's hand slipping

11:30.035 --> 11:32.170
when he was
carving up his victim.

11:32.204 --> 11:33.738
But now we know,

11:33.773 --> 11:35.907
even after examining
these remains numerous times,

11:35.941 --> 11:39.344
we still have
new evidence to find.

11:45.117 --> 11:46.985
GUARD:
<i>Open 12.</i>

11:47.019 --> 11:48.386
GUARD 2: <i>12 open.</i>
(door buzzes)

11:48.420 --> 11:50.288
(door opens)

11:51.390 --> 11:53.291
GUARD (over intercom):
Closing 12.

12:06.405 --> 12:08.173
I declined all visitors.

12:08.207 --> 12:09.767
Yeah, I'm sorry,
but the laws concerning

12:09.775 --> 12:13.344
an ongoing investigation,
they trump those wishes.

12:14.613 --> 12:17.248
Look, I'm here
to help you.

12:17.283 --> 12:18.449
No, thank you.

12:18.484 --> 12:20.051
Just listen
to me. We...

12:20.085 --> 12:22.253
(sighs)

12:22.288 --> 12:24.589
We reopened the investigation
into the murders.

12:24.623 --> 12:27.492
We think you may be innocent.

12:30.062 --> 12:32.530
You understand
what I'm saying to you?

12:32.565 --> 12:36.367
You'd be wasting your time.

12:36.402 --> 12:38.903
Are you saying you're guilty?

12:38.938 --> 12:42.574
I'm saying there's nothing left
for me on this earth.

12:43.509 --> 12:45.577
You have a son.

12:47.246 --> 12:50.014
Is he nothing to you?

12:50.049 --> 12:52.250
I've been fighting
for a decent life

12:52.284 --> 12:54.385
since I was born, Agent Booth.

12:54.420 --> 12:56.788
I've finally learned
that true justice isn't here,

12:56.822 --> 12:59.123
not on this earth.

12:59.158 --> 13:02.794
I'm putting myself
in God's hands now.

13:02.828 --> 13:05.897
If you're putting
your faith into God,

13:05.931 --> 13:09.167
then you should put your faith
into other people.

13:10.069 --> 13:11.736
Nice thought.

13:11.770 --> 13:14.505
The truth is, once I'm dead,

13:14.540 --> 13:18.910
after a couple of days,
I won't even cross your mind.

13:22.047 --> 13:24.616
Look, who else would've killed
those people, Rockwell?

13:24.650 --> 13:27.018
Who else?

13:27.052 --> 13:28.519
(muffled):
Pick it back up.

13:28.554 --> 13:30.622
Pick the phone
back up.

13:30.656 --> 13:33.191
(muffled):
Hey! I am trying to help you!

13:33.225 --> 13:34.525
Listen to me. Hey!

13:34.560 --> 13:36.527
Who else?

13:41.467 --> 13:44.035
(door buzzes)

13:49.294 --> 13:50.895
You wanted to see me,
Dr. Fuentes?

13:50.929 --> 13:52.897
Did Ted Widmer
use drugs?

13:52.931 --> 13:54.899
Not that we found
in the initial investigation.

13:54.933 --> 13:56.066
Why?

13:56.101 --> 13:58.436
I found a
tiny nick

13:58.470 --> 13:59.790
in the base of
Widmer's manubrium,

13:59.805 --> 14:01.872
indicative of an injury
caused by a needle.

14:01.907 --> 14:03.388
Was this nick in Dr. Brennan's
original findings?

14:03.412 --> 14:04.108
No.

14:04.109 --> 14:05.643
I didn't see anything like it
in the other remains.

14:05.677 --> 14:06.844
SAROYAN:
We know the killer

14:06.878 --> 14:08.412
injected his victims
with opiates

14:08.447 --> 14:09.647
at the base of their skull.

14:09.681 --> 14:10.948
Maybe this is another
injection site.

14:10.982 --> 14:12.349
Have we heard anything
from Booth?

14:12.384 --> 14:13.584
Apparently,

14:13.618 --> 14:15.352
Alex is being uncooperative,

14:15.387 --> 14:17.347
so Booth's on his way
to see Alex's ex-girlfriend.

14:17.355 --> 14:19.123
Maybe she can help.
Well, hopefully,

14:19.157 --> 14:21.058
she can point us
in the direction of a suspect.

14:21.092 --> 14:23.294
'cause I got to say,
I'm gonna swab this,

14:23.328 --> 14:25.963
but honestly,
with only 27 hours left,

14:25.997 --> 14:27.798
I am not feeling too optimistic.

14:27.833 --> 14:30.668
So no luck with the fibers
retrieved from Alex's car?

14:30.702 --> 14:32.970
No. So far, everything
points back to Alex.

14:33.004 --> 14:35.606
There's nothing that links to Saltz.
FUENTES: This is ridiculous.

14:35.640 --> 14:38.042
We're trying to find
a serial killer in one day.

14:38.076 --> 14:39.477
Yeah, this is the problem
with the death penalty.

14:39.511 --> 14:41.245
Innocent people die.
Well, we don't know

14:41.279 --> 14:42.780
for sure that Rockwell
is innocent.

14:42.814 --> 14:44.882
Perhaps Dr. Brennan
was mistaken,

14:44.916 --> 14:46.817
and his rotator cuff injuries
didn't prevent him

14:46.852 --> 14:48.452
from killing Barnes.
FUENTES: Makes no difference.

14:48.487 --> 14:51.155
Putting people to death
is inhumane.

14:51.189 --> 14:53.591
What happened to these people
in that factory was inhumane.

14:53.625 --> 14:55.626
So you believe
in the death penalty?

14:55.660 --> 14:58.562
My personal beliefs aren't
pertinent to this case.

14:58.597 --> 14:59.897
You cannot be serious.

14:59.931 --> 15:03.467
42% of death row
population is black,

15:03.502 --> 15:05.035
yet African-Americans
make up

15:05.070 --> 15:08.339
only 13.2%
of the overall U.S. population.

15:08.373 --> 15:09.373
SAROYAN:
So a person shouldn't believe

15:09.407 --> 15:10.674
in the death penalty because of

15:10.709 --> 15:12.343
the color of their skin?
How liberal of you.

15:12.377 --> 15:15.012
If it was Michelle
on this table,

15:15.046 --> 15:17.181
I'd want the person
who killed her to pay in kind.

15:17.215 --> 15:18.935
And so would you,
if it was Michael Vincent.

15:18.950 --> 15:20.217
I'd like to think
that I'm better than that.

15:20.252 --> 15:21.385
And I'd feel fine

15:21.419 --> 15:22.786
knowing justice was served.

15:22.821 --> 15:24.588
And I'm grateful
to finally be in a country

15:24.623 --> 15:26.090
where we can debate about this.

15:26.124 --> 15:27.391
But not right now.

15:27.425 --> 15:28.459
Rockwell dies

15:28.493 --> 15:29.493
tomorrow at midnight.

15:29.494 --> 15:30.628
Me, personally?

15:30.662 --> 15:32.596
I don't want his life on my head

15:32.631 --> 15:35.232
if he's innocent.

15:38.403 --> 15:39.837
I'll swab the needle mark.

15:44.576 --> 15:46.210
WOMAN:
<i>Now Alex is saying</i>

15:46.244 --> 15:48.078
he was framed?
BOOTH: No.

15:48.113 --> 15:49.246
He's not saying anything.

15:49.281 --> 15:50.281
See, that's why we're here.

15:50.315 --> 15:51.549
All I know is
I was living

15:51.583 --> 15:53.083
with a criminal.

15:53.118 --> 15:54.652
I can't help you.

15:54.686 --> 15:56.654
Lauren...
No, Torrance.

15:56.688 --> 15:59.290
I have stood by Alex
time and time again,

15:59.324 --> 16:01.926
and he always lands
back in prison.

16:01.960 --> 16:04.828
I have to think about Zeke now.

16:04.863 --> 16:06.630
My son is my priority.

16:06.665 --> 16:08.732
No one else.
All right. Pastor Evans,

16:08.767 --> 16:11.635
I-I remember you
from Alex's trial.

16:11.670 --> 16:14.638
You, Alex and Lauren--
you go way back, right?

16:14.673 --> 16:16.440
Yeah, Alex and I came up

16:16.474 --> 16:18.542
as altar boys together
under Father Nabors.

16:18.577 --> 16:21.445
I guess you could say
our lives took different paths.

16:21.479 --> 16:23.113
Are you two...

16:23.148 --> 16:24.582
He's Zeke's godfather.

16:24.616 --> 16:25.883
That's all.

16:25.917 --> 16:27.317
TORRANCE:
It's hard to raise a child

16:27.319 --> 16:28.319
without a man in the house.

16:28.353 --> 16:29.920
I'm just doing what I can.

16:29.955 --> 16:31.055
BOOTH: I'm sorry, but
where was all this concern

16:31.089 --> 16:32.489
for Lauren and Zeke

16:32.524 --> 16:34.725
when you testified
against Alex at the trial?

16:34.759 --> 16:37.261
Excuse me, but I didn't testify
against Alex.

16:37.295 --> 16:39.897
You testified that Alex held
a grudge against Father Nabors.

16:39.931 --> 16:42.833
Father Nabors kicked Alex
out of the altar boy program

16:42.867 --> 16:44.668
when he caught Alex stealing.

16:44.703 --> 16:46.370
Alex never forgave him
for that.

16:46.404 --> 16:48.305
You see how that
could be construed

16:48.340 --> 16:51.475
as pretty damning testimony?

16:59.184 --> 17:01.151
I was asked a question.

17:01.186 --> 17:02.553
I was under oath.

17:02.587 --> 17:04.855
A-Am I a suspect now?

17:04.888 --> 17:06.957
Well, we're just
asking questions, that's all.

17:06.992 --> 17:08.358
Gentlemen,

17:08.393 --> 17:11.095
I'm sorry
Alex is about to be executed.

17:11.128 --> 17:13.196
I personally believe
that his judgment

17:13.231 --> 17:15.265
should be between him and God.

17:15.300 --> 17:18.202
But he's there
because of choices he made.

17:18.236 --> 17:21.038
Not because I put him there.

17:27.378 --> 17:29.780
BRENNAN:
<i>You don't really believe</i>

17:29.814 --> 17:31.882
that Torrance Evans
killed all those people

17:31.916 --> 17:34.118
and framed Alex to get
to his family, do you?

17:34.152 --> 17:35.719
Look, I don't know anything,
but we don't...

17:35.754 --> 17:37.154
we're running out of time
right here.

17:37.188 --> 17:38.656
We got to look
at everyone, okay?

17:38.690 --> 17:39.957
Aubrey is-is digging up

17:39.991 --> 17:41.592
everything he can
on Evans right now.

17:41.626 --> 17:43.927
I'm just trying to say
that there's no evidence

17:43.962 --> 17:45.996
to indicate that Evans
is a serial killer.

17:46.031 --> 17:47.498
There's no evidence
that indicates anything

17:47.532 --> 17:49.400
about anyone except Rockwell.

17:49.434 --> 17:51.568
Do you see? That's the problem.

17:51.603 --> 17:53.737
So you think I'm wrong.

17:53.772 --> 17:55.305
That Rockwell is guilty.

17:55.340 --> 17:57.875
(scoffs)
I didn't say that.

17:57.909 --> 17:59.209
You didn't have to.

17:59.244 --> 18:00.678
Look, I think that
you're the best, okay?

18:00.712 --> 18:01.912
I am putting
everything on you.

18:01.913 --> 18:04.715
I'm trusting you.

18:05.750 --> 18:07.418
MAN: Excuse me,
Agent Booth?

18:07.452 --> 18:09.953
Mr. Flender.
What are you doing here?

18:09.988 --> 18:11.822
Thomas Saltz came into
work today very upset.

18:11.856 --> 18:13.323
He said that you
guys brought him in.

18:13.358 --> 18:15.292
I don't have time
for your lectures

18:15.326 --> 18:17.761
on how good your men are.
That's not why I'm here.

18:17.796 --> 18:19.930
Like you, I believe that
Alex Rockwell is innocent.

18:19.964 --> 18:21.642
Do you have any information
pertinent to the case?

18:21.666 --> 18:22.767
No, but...

18:22.767 --> 18:25.335
you could bring me in.
Officially, as a suspect.

18:25.370 --> 18:26.770
I don't understand.
Why would you want to do that?

18:26.805 --> 18:28.405
Are you confessing?
No.

18:28.440 --> 18:30.307
But Rockwell, Saltz,
the other ex-cons--

18:30.341 --> 18:31.809
they all worked for me.

18:31.843 --> 18:34.445
That makes me as much of
a suspect as Saltz, right?

18:34.479 --> 18:36.547
So the judge will have
to postpone the execution

18:36.581 --> 18:39.083
if you tell her
that I'm your main suspect.

18:39.117 --> 18:40.551
You would do that for Alex?

18:40.585 --> 18:42.052
I'd do that for any of my men

18:42.087 --> 18:44.021
who I believed were innocent.
The judge

18:44.055 --> 18:46.590
is not gonna stop the execution
because we bring you in.

18:46.624 --> 18:48.592
She's gonna want hard evidence.

18:48.626 --> 18:51.095
So where does that leave Alex?

18:58.636 --> 19:01.538
HODGINS: <i>There was nothing</i>
<i>in the new swab.</i>

19:01.573 --> 19:04.374
So I just went over every one
of my original findings--

19:04.409 --> 19:06.043
I mean, every particulate,
every fungi...

19:06.077 --> 19:07.311
Let me guess.

19:07.345 --> 19:08.779
You found nothing new.
(sighs)

19:08.813 --> 19:11.548
I feel completely useless here,
you know?

19:11.616 --> 19:13.617
What are these?
What, are we house hunting?

19:13.651 --> 19:14.852
Oh. Uh, that's nothing.

19:14.886 --> 19:16.954
Oh... don't worry about that.
Oh!

19:16.988 --> 19:18.756
These are Paris listings.

19:18.790 --> 19:21.125
You want to buy
a vacation home in Paris.

19:21.159 --> 19:25.596
I... I was thinking
about a <i>home</i> home.

19:27.432 --> 19:29.266
It-it... it's stupid.

19:29.300 --> 19:30.901
It's not even important
right now.

19:30.935 --> 19:32.102
Angie, Angie,

19:32.137 --> 19:34.071
talk to me. What's going on?

19:34.105 --> 19:37.307
I just started imagining

19:37.342 --> 19:40.778
what our lives would be like
without all this death

19:40.812 --> 19:44.414
and shadow governments
and-and serial killers.

19:44.449 --> 19:45.983
What a life
would be like

19:46.017 --> 19:50.087
without my best friend's house
getting shot up.

19:50.121 --> 19:53.690
Where you could maybe teach
at the Sorbonne and-and...

19:53.725 --> 19:55.926
I could paint stuff.

19:55.960 --> 19:57.761
Doesn't that
sound nice?

19:57.796 --> 19:59.797
This is a little more
than imagining.

19:59.831 --> 20:01.498
I mean, you're serious.

20:01.533 --> 20:03.433
Wh-When were you gonna
mention this to me?

20:03.468 --> 20:04.635
Well, I mean,
I was working on the case.

20:04.669 --> 20:05.936
You-you brought it up.

20:05.970 --> 20:08.038
It was sitting on your desk.
Well, I-I...

20:08.072 --> 20:10.941
I don't think we should talk
about it right now.

20:11.843 --> 20:13.343
(sighs)

20:13.378 --> 20:15.045
You're right.
Yeah.

20:15.079 --> 20:17.381
So, uh, the scan I did

20:17.415 --> 20:19.850
confirmed
Brennan's theory.

20:19.884 --> 20:22.619
Rockwell was incapable
of the force profile

20:22.654 --> 20:24.788
for the fractures
to Barnes' skull.

20:24.823 --> 20:28.325
So then I remembered
something that Sweets said.

20:28.359 --> 20:30.127
That a serial killer usually has

20:30.161 --> 20:32.296
a personal connection
to his first victim.

20:32.330 --> 20:34.487
So I went through Barnes'
e-mails and bills.

20:34.511 --> 20:35.032
Mm-hmm.

20:35.033 --> 20:38.302
Now, we already knew
he was into cocaine.

20:38.336 --> 20:39.837
Two weeks before he died,

20:39.871 --> 20:42.139
he spent
an exorbitant amount of money

20:42.173 --> 20:43.707
on flowers
for a funeral.

20:43.741 --> 20:45.609
A funeral? Who died?

20:45.643 --> 20:47.244
His driver.
He had a driver?

20:47.278 --> 20:48.979
Yeah. He was loaded.

20:49.013 --> 20:52.082
I'll keep looking and see if
anything else jumps out at me.

20:52.116 --> 20:53.483
Yeah.

20:55.086 --> 20:57.688
I looked into Pastor Evans
and found a sealed juvie record

20:57.722 --> 20:59.690
from when he was 15
for car theft.

20:59.724 --> 21:01.258
Are you trying
to tell me

21:01.292 --> 21:03.093
you didn't pull
any dumb stuff in your youth?

21:03.127 --> 21:05.028
Me? I was
a Boy Scout.

21:06.397 --> 21:07.698
Actually a Boy Scout.

21:07.732 --> 21:09.299
Anyway, look,

21:09.334 --> 21:12.502
other than the sealed
juvie record, guy's clean.

21:12.537 --> 21:14.938
What about Dr. Brennan
and the cute Cuban at the lab?

21:14.973 --> 21:16.373
Between all those victims,

21:16.407 --> 21:18.242
they've got enough bones
to fill a clown car.

21:18.276 --> 21:19.776
Have they found anything?

21:19.811 --> 21:22.779
Uh, a needle mark, a cut
that they didn't see before,

21:22.814 --> 21:25.849
but nothing that gives
us another killer.

21:26.784 --> 21:28.685
What is it?

21:28.720 --> 21:30.854
What are we missing?

21:35.593 --> 21:37.527
Bones.

21:37.562 --> 21:39.062
Wait a second.
Bones, wake up.

21:39.097 --> 21:40.964
What is it? Wh-What's wrong?
Wake up, listen.

21:40.999 --> 21:44.234
Uh... there's a pattern.

21:44.269 --> 21:45.636
The dates that
the victims died.

21:45.670 --> 21:47.237
I can't believe
I didn't see this.

21:47.272 --> 21:49.273
It was right in front of me.
Wh-What pattern?

21:49.307 --> 21:51.808
Look, the killer hasn't gone
more than three or four months

21:51.843 --> 21:53.744
without killing someone.

21:53.778 --> 21:55.712
Sweets used to say

21:55.747 --> 21:57.714
that serial killers are
compulsive by nature.

21:57.749 --> 21:59.950
They can't stop.
Right, so and if Rockwell's been in jail

21:59.984 --> 22:01.585
for more than seven
months-- I mean,

22:01.619 --> 22:03.320
if the real killer
is still out there...

22:03.354 --> 22:05.589
He must have killed someone
in the last few months.

22:05.623 --> 22:07.624
There has to be another body
out there, Bones.

22:07.659 --> 22:09.426
There just has to be.

22:09.460 --> 22:10.961
(sighs)

22:15.653 --> 22:18.221
So we have to get
<i>into the head of the killer,</i>

22:18.222 --> 22:20.056
so I did some research
on the history

22:20.091 --> 22:22.092
of the Scovell Iron
Works factory.

22:22.126 --> 22:24.094
Now, it turns out
that land belonged

22:24.128 --> 22:26.163
to a monastery
in the 1700s.

22:26.197 --> 22:27.697
So the factory was built
on holy land.

22:27.732 --> 22:29.266
Given the ritualistic nature
of the killings,

22:29.300 --> 22:30.667
that can't be a coincidence.

22:30.701 --> 22:33.170
Yeah, exactly.
Which means the killer would

22:33.204 --> 22:34.804
want his new hideaway
to be on holy ground.

22:34.839 --> 22:36.806
Well, this is a map of
all of the religious ground

22:36.841 --> 22:38.775
in the tri-state area.

22:38.809 --> 22:40.710
That's a lot of ground to cover.

22:40.745 --> 22:42.712
Yeah, but we know he
needs his privacy, right?

22:42.747 --> 22:45.282
So we can rule out any
active churches, mosques,

22:45.316 --> 22:47.250
synagogues.

22:47.285 --> 22:50.420
So that narrows us down
to 42 locations.

22:50.454 --> 22:52.856
42.
Well, that's a start, Dr. Hodgins.

22:52.890 --> 22:54.958
Send everything you have
over to the FBI.

22:54.992 --> 22:56.927
I want us all working on this.

23:03.401 --> 23:06.303
Well, it looks like you haven't
moved in quite a while.

23:06.337 --> 23:08.338
Have they found
a new victim yet?

23:08.372 --> 23:10.207
Angela's working
with the FBI

23:10.241 --> 23:12.742
to try to narrow down
a possible location.

23:12.777 --> 23:14.644
And Booth is trying
Rockwell one more time.

23:14.679 --> 23:17.047
And I brought
you breakfast.

23:17.081 --> 23:19.149
Oh, thank you, I'm not hungry.
Maybe you're not,

23:19.183 --> 23:21.918
but that little person
inside must be starving.

23:24.422 --> 23:26.790
It's an eggless
tofu omelet.

23:26.824 --> 23:28.225
Booth said it's
your favorite,

23:28.259 --> 23:31.561
which is upsetting,
but eat, please.

23:31.596 --> 23:34.931
Thank you.

23:34.966 --> 23:36.900
Have you found
anything yet?

23:36.934 --> 23:40.237
No.

23:40.271 --> 23:43.506
No, I-I pride myself
on my thoroughness

23:43.541 --> 23:47.777
and not making mistakes,
and yet I've made a mistake.

23:47.812 --> 23:49.446
All the evidence
pointed to Rockwell,

23:49.480 --> 23:51.314
including the knife
they found in his car.

23:51.349 --> 23:52.482
This isn't your fault.

23:52.516 --> 23:53.850
Of course it is.

23:53.884 --> 23:56.253
It's my work that put him
on death row.

23:56.287 --> 23:58.255
The only person
responsible is the bastard

23:58.289 --> 24:02.125
who killed those four
men and framed Rockwell.

24:05.029 --> 24:07.364
I wish I could believe that.

24:07.398 --> 24:09.132
MONTENEGRO:
Hey.

24:09.166 --> 24:10.967
I think we did it.
We found a location

24:11.002 --> 24:12.302
that might give us a new victim.

24:12.336 --> 24:13.903
Aubrey and Caroline are
on their way

24:13.938 --> 24:16.506
to the judge right now
to get a warrant.

24:19.076 --> 24:20.310
See?

24:20.344 --> 24:22.512
We will solve this
case, Dr. Brennan.

24:22.546 --> 24:23.546
Yes.

24:23.581 --> 24:26.182
But my fear is
that when we do,

24:26.217 --> 24:28.351
Rockwell will
already be dead.

24:45.002 --> 24:46.202
You can sit.

24:46.237 --> 24:47.637
No, we can't, <i>Cherie.</i>

24:47.672 --> 24:49.506
C-Can you try
the judge again?

24:49.540 --> 24:50.940
We really need
that warrant.

24:50.975 --> 24:52.275
She is probably
in the parking structure.

24:52.310 --> 24:53.510
There's no cell service there.

24:53.544 --> 24:54.611
It won't hurt
your fingers

24:54.645 --> 24:57.480
to push those little
buttons and try.

24:57.515 --> 24:59.316
Look, we find
a location, yet?

24:59.350 --> 25:00.984
This kid here has
a good brain stuck

25:01.018 --> 25:02.852
in that cute
head of his.

25:02.887 --> 25:04.321
Okay, so needed
to find a place

25:04.355 --> 25:06.356
that was remote,
abandoned and holy.

25:06.390 --> 25:08.325
This abandoned water treatment
plant was built on land

25:08.359 --> 25:10.260
that belonged
to the Kiskiack tribe.

25:10.294 --> 25:11.661
It's on holy ground.

25:11.696 --> 25:13.129
And at a treatment plant,
they purify water...

25:13.164 --> 25:15.632
Guy's a religious nut--
okay, so the deaths

25:15.666 --> 25:17.734
and the burning after is just
some kind of a purification.

25:17.768 --> 25:21.004
You got it, <i>Cher.</i> Couldn't
you just eat him up?

25:21.038 --> 25:23.239
Oh, God.

25:23.274 --> 25:25.275
What now?
Search warrant, Your Honor.

25:25.309 --> 25:27.243
All right,
let me get a coffee,

25:27.278 --> 25:29.045
and then we'll talk.
No, no time.

25:30.848 --> 25:33.016
(sirens wailing,
indistinct police radio chatter)

25:44.462 --> 25:46.396
N-N-No, l-listen
to me for a second.

25:46.430 --> 25:49.733
Bones, all right, listen, it's
not safe for you to be here.

25:51.001 --> 25:52.602
I don't know,
they kicked us out

25:52.636 --> 25:53.903
because they smelled
some kind of fumes.

25:53.938 --> 25:55.205
All right, I'll
tell you what.

25:55.239 --> 25:56.639
I'll get all the
information to you

25:56.674 --> 25:59.008
as soon as I find
things out. Thanks. Bye.

25:59.043 --> 26:00.310
So we found the victim

26:00.344 --> 26:02.645
in a barrel of ammonia
inside the facility.

26:02.680 --> 26:04.647
Ammonia's one of the chemicals
they use to purify water.

26:04.682 --> 26:06.649
Also good
for dissolving tissue

26:06.684 --> 26:08.651
if used in a high enough
concentration.

26:08.686 --> 26:10.987
Wow, I could make you
an honorary squint.

26:11.021 --> 26:12.655
Listen, before they
rushed us out of there,

26:12.690 --> 26:15.358
we also found a worktable
with large dried blood stains.

26:15.393 --> 26:17.460
Victim was probably bled like the others.
HODGINS: All right, well,

26:17.495 --> 26:19.396
we'll know for sure when we're
done examining the remains.

26:19.430 --> 26:20.730
I got to get back
under the tent.

26:20.765 --> 26:22.232
Well, I got to get back
into the plant.

26:22.266 --> 26:23.767
There's got to be evidence in
there that needs to be secured.

26:23.801 --> 26:25.769
We'll take care of it.
Guys, you don't understand.

26:25.803 --> 26:28.638
One false move in there,
one mistake,

26:28.672 --> 26:30.640
and any moisture on your body
could react with the ammonia

26:30.674 --> 26:32.075
and burn you
from the inside out.

26:32.109 --> 26:33.943
I'll stay out
here, no problems.

26:33.978 --> 26:36.379
Don't have the suit, gonna
stay right here, right?

26:36.414 --> 26:37.614
Yeah.
Sir, this was found

26:37.648 --> 26:39.015
hanging from a pipe
inside the plant.

26:39.049 --> 26:40.650
Okay.

26:40.684 --> 26:42.752
There you go--
it's a piece of tattooed skin

26:42.787 --> 26:45.255
like the one we found
at the ironworks.

26:45.289 --> 26:46.790
This is our guy.

26:46.824 --> 26:49.092
Which means we definitely got

26:49.126 --> 26:51.795
the wrong guy on death row.

26:54.899 --> 26:58.301
FUENTES: Based on the pitting
on the bones, these remains

26:58.335 --> 27:00.703
have been in the ammonia
for roughly three months.

27:00.738 --> 27:03.540
SAROYAN: That fits the right time frame
based on our killer's pattern.

27:03.574 --> 27:05.442
HODGINS: Hopefully, I can
pinpoint a more specific

27:05.476 --> 27:08.344
time of death once I get
a sample of the ammonia here.

27:08.379 --> 27:10.480
Well, we need to hose down
the remains immediately.

27:10.514 --> 27:13.116
N-N-No, that could wash
away vital evidence.

27:13.150 --> 27:15.185
If we don't, the ammonia's
gonna keep eating away

27:15.219 --> 27:17.754
at what little
tissue we have.

27:17.788 --> 27:21.357
Forward protrusion of the
anterior aspect of the mandible.

27:21.392 --> 27:22.725
Narrow zygomatic arch.

27:22.760 --> 27:24.194
The victim's a
black female.

27:24.228 --> 27:26.396
His first female victim.

27:26.430 --> 27:28.064
That we know of.

27:33.537 --> 27:34.671
Keep it.

27:34.705 --> 27:35.839
Thank you, ma'am.

27:35.873 --> 27:37.173
CAROLINE:
Judge Edwards.

27:37.208 --> 27:39.609
This cup of coffee
I'm drinking.

27:39.643 --> 27:41.678
We found another victim,
same M.O.

27:41.712 --> 27:43.947
The evidence matches
the other victims.

27:43.981 --> 27:46.249
Evidence?
Real evidence?

27:46.283 --> 27:48.885
This victim has been dead
for three months.

27:48.919 --> 27:51.855
Her tattooed flesh was found
hanging at the crime scene.

27:51.889 --> 27:54.023
Just like at the
ironworks factory.

27:54.058 --> 27:55.258
CAROLINE:
And they found a similar

27:55.292 --> 27:56.526
work area at the plant,

27:56.560 --> 27:58.428
with bloody restraints,
worktables.

27:58.462 --> 28:00.663
It's all in the file.
BRENNAN: Alex Rockwell has been

28:00.698 --> 28:02.899
in solitary confinement
on death row for seven months.

28:02.933 --> 28:04.400
He could not have done this.

28:04.435 --> 28:06.369
I sympathize with what
you're trying to do,

28:06.403 --> 28:09.372
but Rockwell's was a very
highly publicized trial.

28:09.406 --> 28:12.308
This latest murder could
be a copycat killing.

28:12.343 --> 28:14.277
No... the method is
too precise,

28:14.311 --> 28:15.845
too exacting
to be a copycat.

28:15.880 --> 28:17.780
CAROLINE: Why don't
we all just admit

28:17.815 --> 28:19.749
what's really
happening here?

28:19.783 --> 28:23.219
Executing Alex Rockwell furthers
your political aspirations

28:23.254 --> 28:24.888
as a law and order candidate.

28:28.559 --> 28:31.461
I don't give a crap what you
think about me, Miss Julian.

28:31.495 --> 28:32.729
The law is the law.

28:32.763 --> 28:34.330
Provide me with proof

28:34.365 --> 28:38.201
that Rockwell did not kill
Nabors, Freeman or Widmer,

28:38.235 --> 28:41.437
or he will be executed
as planned in nine hours.

28:43.040 --> 28:44.474
(sighs)

28:44.508 --> 28:46.075
Damn.

28:56.310 --> 28:58.644
"Harbor no ill will.

28:58.679 --> 29:00.947
"Forgive those who might
hurt and betray you.

29:00.981 --> 29:03.383
"Expect nothing,
but give everything.

29:03.417 --> 29:05.218
"What others say is not
who you are.

29:05.252 --> 29:07.653
"The love you hold inside
is who you are.

29:07.688 --> 29:11.524
"Trust in the Lord, for there is
no other justice than in him.

29:11.558 --> 29:14.527
Love, Papa."

29:14.561 --> 29:16.629
(door opens)

29:18.032 --> 29:20.066
GUARD:
Rockwell, it's time.

29:29.943 --> 29:32.612
For my son.

29:34.181 --> 29:36.315
Sure.

29:51.131 --> 29:53.032
Open 14.

29:53.067 --> 29:54.667
(door buzzes)
GUARD: 14 open.

29:56.970 --> 29:59.105
Step out.

30:02.376 --> 30:04.210
We'll take you to
the holding room.

30:04.244 --> 30:05.578
You'll wait there
until it's time

30:05.612 --> 30:07.513
to take you to the
execution chamber.

30:09.883 --> 30:11.984
Right hand.

30:17.257 --> 30:19.926
There's a deep striation
to the victim's anterior C-6.

30:19.960 --> 30:22.295
SAROYAN: Well, that confirms
that she bled out

30:22.329 --> 30:23.329
through her jugular vein

30:23.330 --> 30:25.031
like the other victims.

30:25.065 --> 30:27.633
I also found kerf marks on
the victim's right clavicle

30:27.668 --> 30:29.302
and marks on the
upper thorax.

30:29.336 --> 30:30.803
She was definitely killed
by the same person

30:30.838 --> 30:32.305
who murdered all the
other four victims.

30:32.339 --> 30:34.373
(computer beeps)

30:34.408 --> 30:35.308
Ooh, I got a match.

30:35.342 --> 30:36.642
FUENTES:
Already?

30:36.677 --> 30:38.644
Yeah, looks like
an ex-con.

30:38.679 --> 30:41.681
Seems like the black-sleeve rose
tattoo really did the trick.

30:41.715 --> 30:44.383
It was listed
as a unique identifier.

30:44.418 --> 30:46.486
Tracy Taylor, 33,

30:46.520 --> 30:49.422
reported missing by her parole
officer two months ago.

30:49.456 --> 30:51.557
CAROLINE:
<i>Possession,</i>

30:51.592 --> 30:54.327
dealing, DUIs, prostitution.

30:54.361 --> 30:57.196
This little Tracy Taylor was
a busy woman.

30:57.231 --> 30:59.232
Makes her a perfect
candidate to be purified.

30:59.266 --> 31:00.967
So I get why this sick
puppy thinks

31:01.001 --> 31:02.969
the ex-cons need
to be purified,

31:03.003 --> 31:05.138
but what did Father Nabors
and Barnes do

31:05.172 --> 31:07.173
to earn their spot
on the list?

31:07.207 --> 31:09.308
I have no idea. When we catch
him, you can ask him yourself.

31:09.343 --> 31:11.677
Spoke to Tracy Taylor's
parole officer;

31:11.712 --> 31:13.646
apparently, Tracy was getting
her life back together.

31:13.680 --> 31:15.214
CAROLINE: And I'm
planning on entering

31:15.249 --> 31:17.717
the Miss USA Pageant.
Right?

31:17.751 --> 31:19.552
He said that she was
regularly attending

31:19.586 --> 31:21.721
Narcotics Anonymous
meetings.

31:21.755 --> 31:23.656
Let me guess-- the same meetings
that Thomas Saltz attended.

31:23.690 --> 31:26.159
You got it.
Look, I want Saltz back in here now.

31:26.193 --> 31:27.593
And anyone else
from the N.A. meeting

31:27.628 --> 31:30.029
who may have seen him
and Tracy Taylor together

31:30.063 --> 31:31.197
the day she disappeared.

31:31.231 --> 31:33.466
On it.

31:33.500 --> 31:36.802
Right, okay, so witnesses
at the meetings say

31:36.837 --> 31:38.604
that you and Tracy Taylor
fought for months

31:38.639 --> 31:40.206
leading up to her disappearance.

31:40.240 --> 31:41.841
One guy even said
that you were the reason

31:41.875 --> 31:43.409
Tracy stopped coming
to the meetings.

31:43.443 --> 31:46.012
Oh, so now I've
killed five people?

31:46.046 --> 31:47.880
Did you call Flender?

31:47.915 --> 31:50.016
'Cause I'm not saying anything
till he gets me a lawyer.

31:50.050 --> 31:51.784
Really? Okay, what was it, huh?
She get on your nerves?

31:51.818 --> 31:53.186
She find out
about the other murders?

31:53.220 --> 31:55.388
Maybe she knew
that you weren't at N.A.

31:55.422 --> 31:56.956
the night that
Connor Freeman was murdered.

31:56.990 --> 31:58.224
BOOTH: That makes
sense. What?

31:58.258 --> 31:59.425
She's the only one
standing between

31:59.459 --> 32:00.660
you and the perfect alibi?
No.

32:00.694 --> 32:01.961
You guys are wrong.
Oh, really?

32:01.995 --> 32:03.095
Why don't you help us out, then?

32:03.130 --> 32:03.996
Tracy and I fought.

32:04.031 --> 32:06.299
She kept trying to
get me using again.

32:06.333 --> 32:07.773
Why'd she finally stop?
I don't know.

32:07.801 --> 32:10.136
Maybe someone threatened
to call the cops on her.

32:10.170 --> 32:12.138
I swear on my
mama's soul,

32:12.172 --> 32:14.674
I had no idea that she was dead.

32:20.280 --> 32:22.782
BRENNAN: Kyle Martin.
Who is Kyle Martin?

32:22.816 --> 32:24.617
SAROYAN: Please don't tell me
you found another victim.

32:24.651 --> 32:25.885
MONTENEGRO:
No. I've been looking

32:25.919 --> 32:27.920
for the link
between Leonard Barnes

32:27.955 --> 32:29.722
and anyone else
in Rockwell's life.

32:29.756 --> 32:31.090
And he's the link.

32:31.124 --> 32:32.758
So who is he?
What's the connection?

32:32.793 --> 32:34.193
He was Barnes' driver.

32:34.228 --> 32:36.362
He died two weeks
before Barnes went missing.

32:36.396 --> 32:39.131
You said he spent a ton
on flowers for a funeral.

32:39.166 --> 32:41.167
It was Kyle Martin's funeral?
Yeah.

32:41.201 --> 32:42.668
Look at his
death certificate.

32:42.703 --> 32:45.238
BRENNAN: Says he died
of a drug overdose.

32:45.272 --> 32:46.906
Well, Barnes had cocaine
in his system, lots of it.

32:46.940 --> 32:48.474
Maybe they were drug buddies.

32:48.508 --> 32:50.276
I'm still confused.
What does this have to do

32:50.310 --> 32:51.711
with Alex Rockwell?
MONTENEGRO: It doesn't.

32:51.745 --> 32:52.912
It has to do with

32:52.946 --> 32:54.247
someone else
in Rockwell's life.

32:54.281 --> 32:56.249
Look at Kyle Martin's
mother's name

32:56.283 --> 32:57.883
on the death certificate.

32:57.918 --> 32:59.352
"Rosamund... Flender"?

32:59.386 --> 33:00.987
Oh, my God.

33:01.021 --> 33:05.091
So Kyle Martin was related
to Roger Flender, the baker.

33:05.125 --> 33:07.727
Rosamund Flender was
Roger Flender's sister.

33:07.761 --> 33:09.495
Kyle Martin was his nephew.

33:09.529 --> 33:11.664
Kyle O.D.s
while working for Barnes,

33:11.698 --> 33:14.000
and then two weeks later,
Barnes is murdered?

33:14.034 --> 33:16.168
Flender is the only one
connected to all five victims.

33:16.203 --> 33:18.004
Barnes was the first victim,

33:18.038 --> 33:19.939
which means he must have been
Flender's trigger.

33:19.973 --> 33:22.975
Roger Flender framed Alex.

33:23.010 --> 33:26.579
He's our serial killer.

33:42.455 --> 33:44.211
So Flender thinks he's
some kind of a messiah

33:44.212 --> 33:45.812
and all the ex-cons that
are working for him

33:45.813 --> 33:46.986
are like his
disciples.

33:46.987 --> 33:49.213
He even offered himself up
in place of Alex

33:49.214 --> 33:51.149
like some sort
of martyr.

33:51.183 --> 33:53.384
So as long as they abide
by his rules,

33:53.418 --> 33:55.153
he keeps them protected.
Right.

33:55.187 --> 33:57.021
And they're all devoted to him
because you know what?

33:57.055 --> 33:58.335
He gave them all
a second chance.

33:58.357 --> 33:59.857
CAROLINE:
So he kills anyone

33:59.892 --> 34:01.852
who tries to lead his men
away from righteousness.

34:01.860 --> 34:03.094
And to Flender,

34:03.128 --> 34:04.629
only death
could wash these sins away.

34:04.663 --> 34:05.897
This isn't
gonna be enough

34:05.931 --> 34:07.265
for Judge Edwards.

34:07.299 --> 34:09.132
It's all circumstantial.
We need proof.

34:09.168 --> 34:10.601
BOOTH: Bones is looking
at the remains again.

34:10.636 --> 34:12.370
She's gonna come up
with something.

34:12.404 --> 34:14.639
Hope she can do it
in less than an hour, <i>Cher.</i>

34:18.110 --> 34:20.444
Start at the distal ends of
the tibias and proceed upwards.

34:20.478 --> 34:21.679
Tell me everything
you find,

34:21.713 --> 34:24.181
no matter how small
or insignificant.

34:26.284 --> 34:27.518
This mark...

34:27.553 --> 34:28.686
What is it?

34:28.719 --> 34:30.321
Well, you found a
curved striation

34:30.355 --> 34:32.757
on Father Nabors' left
clavicle yesterday.

34:32.791 --> 34:35.259
Yes, it seemed to
have been caused

34:35.293 --> 34:37.328
when his hand slipped as
he was cutting into the victim.

34:37.362 --> 34:38.996
I don't think
it was a slip.

34:39.031 --> 34:41.799
It looked just
like this one.

34:41.833 --> 34:43.333
I believe you're
right, yes.

34:43.368 --> 34:45.101
It's a perfect curve.

34:45.137 --> 34:47.038
One mark like this
could be a slip, but...

34:47.072 --> 34:48.306
Not two.

34:48.340 --> 34:50.341
This is the kind of mark

34:50.375 --> 34:52.443
you'd expect to find
if it was drawn with a compass.

34:52.476 --> 34:53.678
I'll check
the other remains.

34:53.712 --> 34:55.545
Even if the mark
is not evident,

34:55.581 --> 34:58.482
Angela's particle scans should
show evidence of pressure

34:58.517 --> 35:01.152
that could indicate
the same curve.

35:01.186 --> 35:02.620
We might be able to determine

35:02.654 --> 35:04.422
the weapon that was used
to do this.

35:04.456 --> 35:06.891
If this man Flender felt that
he was performing a ritual,

35:06.925 --> 35:09.060
then he'd consider
his weapon holy.

35:09.094 --> 35:11.562
Which means he would
still have it. Go!

35:13.999 --> 35:16.534
BRENNAN: Focus on the
clavicles, ribs and sternum.

35:16.568 --> 35:18.569
MONTENEGRO: Okay, these
are the burnt layers

35:18.604 --> 35:19.637
being stripped away.

35:19.671 --> 35:20.938
FUENTES:
There it is.

35:20.973 --> 35:22.907
The curved striations
are forming a circle

35:22.941 --> 35:24.342
in the triangle.

35:26.211 --> 35:27.879
SAROYAN:
What's that dot in the center?

35:27.913 --> 35:29.480
It's probably from the weapon

35:29.514 --> 35:30.882
that was used to create
the perfect circle.

35:30.916 --> 35:33.751
BRENNAN:
A compass of some kind was used

35:33.785 --> 35:36.387
to create
this ritualistic symbol.

35:36.421 --> 35:38.990
A triangle pointing downward
could represent a lot of things.

35:39.024 --> 35:40.725
Femininity, water...

35:40.759 --> 35:41.959
No. Hold on, hold on.

35:41.994 --> 35:43.194
It's deity.

35:43.228 --> 35:45.429
This is the Masonic symbol
for deity.

35:45.464 --> 35:46.697
Look-it, look...

35:46.732 --> 35:47.832
The point in the center

35:47.866 --> 35:49.567
represents an individual
"brother."

35:49.601 --> 35:51.135
The circle itself signifies

35:51.169 --> 35:53.671
the boundary line
of his duty to God and man.

35:53.705 --> 35:56.173
That's it!
I-I'll call Booth.

36:19.698 --> 36:21.799
(heart monitor beeping steadily)

36:33.578 --> 36:36.580
(indistinct
police radio chatter)

36:38.250 --> 36:40.985
(indistinct conversations)

36:43.555 --> 36:45.856
FLENDER: You'll find
nothing, Agent Booth,

36:45.891 --> 36:47.658
because there's nothing to find.

36:47.693 --> 36:49.160
There's no way
you're getting away with this.

36:49.194 --> 36:50.995
Getting away with what?
I provide a livelihood

36:51.029 --> 36:53.564
for men that society
has deemed worthless

36:53.598 --> 36:55.166
because they served
a little time.

36:55.200 --> 36:56.600
God's work?

36:56.635 --> 36:58.602
I don't expect you
to understand.

36:58.637 --> 37:00.871
Look, I understand
you're not God.

37:00.906 --> 37:03.174
No sign of the knife
used on Tracy Taylor

37:03.208 --> 37:05.743
or anything that ties him
to the ironworks factory.

37:05.777 --> 37:08.179
Well, it was good (phone ringing)
seeing you all again.

37:08.213 --> 37:09.547
Ah! Have a seat,
will you?

37:09.581 --> 37:11.248
Sit down.

37:11.283 --> 37:13.117
Bones, listen,
you got to give me something,

37:13.151 --> 37:14.385
or this guy's gonna walk.

37:14.419 --> 37:15.753
It's a compass.

37:15.787 --> 37:18.589
The circles were created
with a Masonic compass.

37:18.623 --> 37:20.958
It will have all five
of the victims' DNA on it.

37:20.993 --> 37:22.093
Okay, okay.

37:22.127 --> 37:23.828
What? What are
we looking for?

37:23.862 --> 37:25.696
Make sure
he stays put.

37:25.731 --> 37:28.699
Hurry, <i>Cher,</i> Alex Rockwell
has less than 15 minutes.

37:28.734 --> 37:30.368
Okay, okay.

37:32.704 --> 37:34.872
Wait a second.
Masons are builders, right?

37:34.906 --> 37:36.140
AUBREY:
Yes. Traditionally,

37:36.174 --> 37:37.541
stone and brick builders.

37:37.576 --> 37:39.010
Uh, Aubrey's correct.

37:39.044 --> 37:40.277
Hold on.

37:40.312 --> 37:41.379
What is it, Booth?

37:41.413 --> 37:42.513
Did you find it?

37:42.547 --> 37:43.681
Hold on for a second.

37:51.990 --> 37:53.858
There we go.

37:58.730 --> 38:00.364
(mutters quietly)

38:07.973 --> 38:10.808
Wow.
What do we have here, huh?

38:11.877 --> 38:13.477
We got him. Call it in.

38:19.317 --> 38:20.551
Bones, we got him.

38:20.585 --> 38:21.786
We got Flender.

38:21.820 --> 38:25.156
(chuckles softly)

38:29.327 --> 38:33.030
I kept my men safe, and
I was obedient to my calling.

38:33.065 --> 38:36.333
My perfect obedience is
through my suffering, my death

38:36.368 --> 38:38.302
and ultimately, one day,
my resurrection.

38:38.336 --> 38:40.037
I may not believe
in the death penalty anymore,

38:40.072 --> 38:42.239
but with you,
I'd make an exception.

38:42.274 --> 38:43.507
Get him out of here.

38:43.542 --> 38:45.342
Judge? Ms. Julian.

38:45.377 --> 38:47.378
We have your evidence.

38:48.480 --> 38:50.981

38:52.651 --> 38:54.885

39:14.573 --> 39:15.806
Rockwell's alive.

39:15.841 --> 39:18.008
Oh. Thank God.

39:18.043 --> 39:20.344
I can't imagine what
he must be feeling.

39:20.378 --> 39:22.313
Probably grateful to have

39:22.347 --> 39:24.748
another shot
at living his life.

39:24.783 --> 39:26.350
If it were me,

39:26.384 --> 39:29.053
I would vow not to put off
any dreams until later,

39:29.087 --> 39:32.056
because later...
later is not a guarantee.

39:32.090 --> 39:33.491
Oh.

39:35.527 --> 39:38.329
Hey, I'm sorry
about the whole Paris thing.

39:38.363 --> 39:41.031
I-I wasn't trying
to be sneaky, I just...

39:41.066 --> 39:42.266
Well, if you had

39:42.300 --> 39:44.602
talked to me,
I would have told you

39:44.636 --> 39:48.572
that I thought you were dreaming
a little too small.

39:48.607 --> 39:50.875
Oh, my God.

39:50.909 --> 39:53.878
Whoa. Wait, these...

39:53.912 --> 39:55.679
these houses are beautiful.

39:55.714 --> 39:57.381
Well, we have
the money now, right?

39:57.415 --> 39:59.550
And Michael Vincent
needs a place to play,

39:59.584 --> 40:00.985
and you need a studio.

40:01.019 --> 40:04.421
Are you actually
considering this?

40:04.456 --> 40:06.090
After ten years,

40:06.124 --> 40:10.161
I think we deserve to let life
surprise us, don't you?

40:12.063 --> 40:13.564
Yeah.

40:22.641 --> 40:24.108
BOOTH:
<i>Well, you did good today.</i>

40:24.142 --> 40:27.478
<i>We</i> did.
Yeah.

40:27.512 --> 40:30.714
Was so afraid, Booth.

40:30.749 --> 40:32.716
(sighs)
You know what, Bones?

40:32.751 --> 40:35.386
You got to have as much
faith in you as I do.

40:37.289 --> 40:39.957
I imagine if Flender
is sentenced to death,

40:39.991 --> 40:42.426
Judge Edwards will get
what she wants after all.

40:42.460 --> 40:44.061
Yeah.

40:44.095 --> 40:46.397
A society based
on vengeance.

40:46.431 --> 40:48.632
You don't believe in
the death penalty anymore?

40:50.068 --> 40:52.436
No.

40:52.470 --> 40:55.239
Not after all this, no.

40:56.174 --> 40:57.908
No.

40:57.943 --> 40:59.743
But you know what?
Enough about death.

40:59.778 --> 41:02.713
I mean, we have a whole new
beautiful life to focus on.

41:02.747 --> 41:04.148
Isn't that
right, Tiger?

41:04.182 --> 41:05.749
Tiger?
Ah, it just came out of my mouth.

41:05.784 --> 41:08.219
Come on, let's get
mom and baby to bed.

41:08.253 --> 41:10.087
Oh, well, I'm actually
a little hungry.

41:10.121 --> 41:12.223
Hungry? Of course you are.
Tigers, they love to eat.

41:12.257 --> 41:13.591
Tell you what, I'll
make you one of those

41:13.625 --> 41:14.992
big, huge veggie
sandwiches you like.

41:15.026 --> 41:16.327
I would like
that very much.

41:16.361 --> 41:18.162
Ooh! And some leftover
dumplings from Hop Li.

41:18.196 --> 41:19.863
Of course you
would like that.

41:19.898 --> 41:22.032
And a piece of that, um,
banana walnut cake.

41:22.033 --> 41:24.820
Right, Bones, by the time
we get all that eaten,

41:24.821 --> 41:26.155
it's gonna be breakfast.

41:26.179 --> 41:28.137
Well, an omelette
sounds good, actually.

41:29.305 --> 41:31.999
Omelette <i>and</i> waffles.
Yes.
