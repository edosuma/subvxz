- CALM DOWN.

00:07.307 --> 00:08.675

00:11.211 --> 00:12.712

- OH, MY G--

00:15.148 --> 00:16.216
- I HATE THIS COLOR.

00:16.249 --> 00:18.618

00:18.651 --> 00:20.820

LIKE TO GET INVOLVED HERE.

00:20.854 --> 00:22.322

A LOT HIGHER THAN THAT.

00:33.166 --> 00:34.668

00:34.701 --> 00:36.036

00:46.112 --> 00:48.648
WHAT MAKES ME BETTER IS THAT
I WORK HARDER THAN ANYONE ELSE.

00:48.682 --> 00:49.916
- LOOK ME IN THE EYE, MAN,

[imitates chicken squawking]
I'M A PRETTY TOUGH GUY,

01:28.755 --> 01:30.590
THERE'S ONE SWEET SPOT.

01:30.623 --> 01:32.192
AND THAT'S PUPPIES.

01:32.225 --> 01:35.528
SHE IS THE CUTEST THING
I'VE EVER SEEN.

01:35.562 --> 01:38.264
WHAT'S, LIKE, THE MAX HOURS
SHE COULD BE HOME BY HERSELF--

01:38.298 --> 01:41.234
LIKE, SIX, SEVEN HOURS,
MORE?

01:41.267 --> 01:43.303
- WELL, A PUPPY NEEDS
A LOT OF TIME, PATIENCE.

01:43.336 --> 01:45.905
YOU HAVE TO CLEAN UP
AFTER THEM CONSTANTLY,

01:45.939 --> 01:50.143
YOU KNOW,
AND THEY NEED A LOT OF LOVE.

01:50.176 --> 01:51.378
- WHY DOES SHE HAVE
WHITE NAILS?

01:51.411 --> 01:52.979
I LIKE THAT.

FREDRIK SPEAKING.

01:58.885 --> 01:59.953
HEY, TIM.

02:03.957 --> 02:05.959
YEAH?

02:08.061 --> 02:08.962
OKAY.

02:09.062 --> 02:10.296
TIM'S A FORMER CLIENT OF MINE.

02:10.330 --> 02:12.832
HE'S A VERY WELL-KNOWN
ANESTHESIOLOGIST--

02:12.866 --> 02:14.200
LOTS OF CELEBRITY CLIENTS.

02:14.234 --> 02:17.871

02:31.818 --> 02:34.354
[clears throat]
SHE'S SO BEAUTIFUL.

02:34.387 --> 02:35.855
BUT I THINK
MAYBE SHE NEEDS SOMEBODY

02:35.889 --> 02:40.226
WHO DOESN'T HAVE
A JOB LIKE I DO.

02:40.260 --> 02:41.561
OKAY, THANK YOU.

02:41.594 --> 02:43.096
I GOTTA RUN.
- OKAY.

02:45.732 --> 02:46.900
[puppy whines]

03:01.181 --> 03:02.682
- NICK AND PENNY
ARE BUYERS FROM FLORIDA.

03:02.716 --> 03:05.385
AND THEY ARE THE MOST DIFFICULT
CLIENTS I'VE EVER HAD.

03:05.418 --> 03:08.088
- WHAT'S BOTHERING ME ABOUT THE
FLOOR, I'LL BE HONEST WITH YOU,

03:08.121 --> 03:10.724
IT'S STARTING TO MAKE ME DIZZY.
- I CAN'T TAKE THIS.

03:16.196 --> 03:18.531
- HELLO, WHAT'S UP?
- YEP.

03:18.565 --> 03:20.333
I'M JUST
TRYING TO FIGURE OUT--

03:20.367 --> 03:22.936
- YOU JUST AGED, LIKE, 40 YEARS.
WHAT'S THE MATTER?

03:22.969 --> 03:25.472
- I JUST AGED 40 YEARS?
- YEAH.

03:25.505 --> 03:27.107
- I LITERALLY,
BEFORE THEY JUMP ON THE PLANE,

03:27.140 --> 03:28.708
I HAVE THEM FOR ONE MORE SHOT,

03:28.742 --> 03:30.944
AND I--I MEAN, I GOTTA
FIGURE OUT WHAT TO DO--

03:30.977 --> 03:33.079
- I FEEL LIKE--
I MEAN, YOU TRIED THE EAST SIDE.

03:33.079 --> 03:34.381
I DON'T THINK
EAST SIDE'S WORKING.

03:34.414 --> 03:37.517
MAYBE GO FOR, LIKE,
A COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ANGLE.

03:37.550 --> 03:40.887
- I MEAN, THAT'S RISKY.

03:40.920 --> 03:42.489
I AM NATURALLY AN ANXIOUS GUY.

03:42.522 --> 03:47.260
SO WORKING WITH PEOPLE
WHO ARE NONCOMMITTAL LIKE THIS

03:47.293 --> 03:48.962
AND INDECISIVE...

03:48.995 --> 03:50.797
LIKE, PUSHES ME OVER THE EDGE.

03:50.830 --> 03:52.465
- YOU'RE HAVING
THE SAME PROBLEM EACH ONE.

03:52.499 --> 03:53.967
IT'S THIS, BUT IT'S THIS.
IT'S THAT, BUT IT'S THAT.

03:54.000 --> 03:55.168
YOU NEED TO JUST BLOW THEM AWAY

03:55.201 --> 03:56.536
WITH SOMETHING
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

03:56.569 --> 03:58.104
- WHAT DO WE DO?

03:58.104 --> 03:59.706
WHAT DO YOU THINK
I SHOULD SHOW THEM?

04:05.045 --> 04:07.047
I CAN TAKE THEM
TO THE ONE WITH THE HOT TUB--

04:07.047 --> 04:08.682
OUTDOOR SPACE FACING THE WATER.

04:08.715 --> 04:11.918
YOU FEEL LIKE
YOU'RE FLOATING ON THE WATER.

04:11.951 --> 04:14.320
OKAY.
- THAT COULD BE GOOD.

04:14.354 --> 04:15.922
- TAKE THEM TO A BLANK CANVAS

04:15.955 --> 04:18.058
WITH THE VIEW, WITH THE SPACE.

04:18.091 --> 04:21.261
- AND YOU JUST
GOT YOURSELF A DEAL.

04:21.294 --> 04:24.597
- I THINK I JUST
HAD A GENIUS MOMENT.

04:24.631 --> 04:27.467
- ARE YOU TAKING CREDIT
FOR MY GENIUSES AGAIN?

04:27.500 --> 04:29.769
- I THINK THIS IS
A PRETTY GOOD PLAN.

04:29.803 --> 04:31.705
AND SHOULD THINGS GO WRONG,

04:31.738 --> 04:34.607
I HAVE ONE MORE SECRET WEAPON
SHOULD I NEED IT.

04:34.641 --> 04:35.909
OKAY.

04:46.953 --> 04:49.956
- IN MY LAST LISTING, MY DEAL
WITH FREDRIK WAS A DISASTER.

04:49.989 --> 04:51.791
- I'M REALLY SORRY
THAT I MADE YOU CRY

04:51.825 --> 04:53.393
OVER A PIECE OF WALLPAPER.

04:53.426 --> 04:54.494
- YEAH, I WAS CRYING
ALL NIGHT, FREDRIK.

04:54.527 --> 04:55.662
SEE, THAT'S WHAT
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

04:55.695 --> 04:56.796
IT'S CONDESCENDING.

04:56.830 --> 04:58.465
SO I HAD TO LEAVE THE LISTING.

04:58.498 --> 05:00.433
BUT NOW THINGS ARE GOING
IN A POSITIVE DIRECTION.

05:00.467 --> 05:02.335
- HI!
- HEY, HOLLY.

05:02.369 --> 05:03.770
- HOW ARE YOU?
- I'M GOOD.

05:03.803 --> 05:05.505
- SO NICE TO SEE YOU.

05:05.538 --> 05:07.374
111TH AVENUE IS
AN AMAZING NEW BUILDING,

05:07.407 --> 05:09.542
DESIGNED BY
THE WORLD FAMOUS JEAN NOUVEL.

05:09.576 --> 05:10.643
- MICHAEL?
- MM-HMM?

05:10.677 --> 05:11.644
- HI.
- HI.

05:11.678 --> 05:12.645
- I'M AARON.
- HI.

05:12.679 --> 05:13.813
- HI, NICE TO MEET YOU.

05:13.847 --> 05:14.881
- I'M LOOKING
FOR A FRIEND OF MINE--

05:14.914 --> 05:16.716
A FRENCH FRIEND
CALLED PIERRE.

05:16.750 --> 05:19.052
HE'S LOOKING TO INVEST
INTO APARTMENTS IN NEW YORK.

05:19.052 --> 05:21.187
- OH, TO INVEST.
OKAY.

05:24.491 --> 05:25.825
THIS IS WHAT
YOU'RE OFFERING ME--

05:25.859 --> 05:28.495
A MILLION DOLLARS
BELOW OUR ASKING PRICE?

05:28.528 --> 05:29.496
ARE YOU FREE RIGHT NOW?

05:29.529 --> 05:31.064
CAN YOU MEET ME
OVER AT THE BUILDING

05:31.064 --> 05:32.432
WHEN YOU GET A CHANCE
IN, LIKE, TWO HOURS?

05:32.465 --> 05:35.368
IF I CAN PULL THIS DEAL OFF,
IT'D BE AMAZING.

05:35.402 --> 05:36.569
[knock at door]
- MICHAEL?

05:36.603 --> 05:37.971
- HEY.
- HEY, HOW ARE YOU?

05:38.071 --> 05:40.106
- MY STRATEGY HERE IS THAT,
SINCE AARON AND HIS CLIENTS

05:40.140 --> 05:43.109
REALLY AREN'T STEPPING UP
TO THE TWO-BEDROOM PRICE POINT,

05:43.143 --> 05:44.678
I'LL SHOW THEM A ONE-BEDROOM.

05:44.711 --> 05:46.179
THEY'LL BE ABLE TO GET
IN THE JEAN NOUVEL BUILDING

05:46.212 --> 05:47.814
AT THE PRICE
THEY WANT TO SPEND.

05:47.847 --> 05:49.182
I KNOW WE TALKED
ABOUT THE TWO-BEDROOMS,

05:49.215 --> 05:50.650
BUT I WANTED TO SHOW YOU
THIS ONE-BEDROOM.

05:50.684 --> 05:51.951
I MEAN,
THE DEVELOPERS, YOU KNOW,

05:51.985 --> 05:53.286
REALLY WANNA GET RID
OF ALL THE ONE-BEDROOMS.

05:53.319 --> 05:54.688
- SURE.
- SO...

05:54.721 --> 05:56.089
I THOUGHT MAYBE THIS WOULD BE

05:56.089 --> 05:57.624
SOMETHING OF INTEREST
TO YOUR CLIENT.

05:57.657 --> 05:59.092
- SURE, SHOW ME AROUND.

05:59.125 --> 06:00.493
I'LL TAKE A LOOK.
- YEAH, SO...

06:00.527 --> 06:02.595
YOU GOT THE SAME FEATURES
WE HAVE IN ALL THE APARTMENTS,

06:02.629 --> 06:04.364
THE SAME, YOU KNOW,
JEAN NOUVEL DESIGN.

06:04.397 --> 06:07.534
AND HERE, THIS ONE KIND OF
LOOKS OVER CHELSEA PIERS.

06:07.567 --> 06:10.537
HUGE WALK-IN CLOSET THAT'S
ALMOST LIKE A SECOND BEDROOM.

06:10.570 --> 06:12.872
AND THEN
THIS REALLY COOL MASTER BATH.

06:12.906 --> 06:14.107
I MEAN, IT HAS THE SAME FINISH

06:14.140 --> 06:15.642
AS THE REST OF THE BATHS
IN THE BUILDING,

06:15.675 --> 06:17.210
YOU KNOW, WITH
THE ELECTRONIC FAUCETS

06:17.243 --> 06:18.778
AND THE SCONCES
BEHIND THE MIRRORS.

06:18.812 --> 06:22.048
BUT HERE YOU ACTUALLY HAVE A
WINDOW THROUGH THE MASTER BATH

06:22.048 --> 06:26.186
INTO THE BEDROOM AND THEN
OUT ON TO THE STREET.

06:26.219 --> 06:28.054
WE'RE ASKING 1.6 MILLION.
- 1.6, OKAY.

06:28.088 --> 06:30.123
- YOU KNOW, IT'S OBVIOUSLY
PRICED A LOT LESS,

06:30.156 --> 06:32.058
YOU KNOW, LIKE HALF THE PRICE
OF THE TWO-BEDROOMS.

06:32.092 --> 06:34.060
- SURE. WELL,
IT'S AN INVESTMENT PROPERTY.

06:34.060 --> 06:35.528
- EXACTLY.
- SO IT COULD WORK FOR HIM.

06:35.562 --> 06:37.063
- RIGHT.
- I'LL GIVE HIM A CALL.

06:37.097 --> 06:39.733
AND THEN I'LL GET BACK TO YOU
AND LET YOU KNOW.

06:39.766 --> 06:41.101
- FINGERS CROSSED.

06:41.134 --> 06:42.669
- MAYBE WE CAN WORK
SOMETHING OUT.

06:42.702 --> 06:44.504
- OKAY.

06:49.309 --> 06:50.276
[car horn honking]

06:50.310 --> 06:51.878
- CAN YOU TAKE ME
TO 17TH STREET?

06:51.911 --> 06:53.780
- YEP.
- THANK YOU.

06:53.813 --> 06:56.816
CHELSEA USED TO BE
A PRETTY BAD AREA.

06:56.850 --> 06:59.119
10, 15, 20 YEARS AGO,

06:59.152 --> 07:01.187
NOBODY WANTED TO LIVE THERE.

07:01.221 --> 07:04.157
TODAY IT'S A VERY,
VERY NICE AREA--

07:04.190 --> 07:05.458
BEAUTIFUL, TREE-LINED STREETS,

07:05.492 --> 07:07.193
GREAT RESTAURANTS,
GREAT SHOPPING.

07:07.227 --> 07:09.229
IT'S VERY EXPENSIVE.

07:13.466 --> 07:14.668
- HI.
- HEY, FREDRIK, HOW ARE YOU?

07:14.701 --> 07:16.069
GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

07:16.102 --> 07:18.038
SO THIS IS THE APARTMENT?
- IT IS.

07:36.690 --> 07:40.226
- THEN AT NIGHTTIME, YOU GET
THE EMPIRE STATE GLOWING THERE.

07:40.260 --> 07:41.561
- YEAH, AS YOU CAN SEE,
THERE'S ACTUALLY

07:41.594 --> 07:44.364
A PRETTY GOOD VIEW
OF THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING.

07:44.397 --> 07:45.832
THIS IS THE MASTER BEDROOM.

07:45.865 --> 07:47.867
- HMM.
WHAT IS THIS?

07:47.901 --> 07:49.169
PAINTING?

07:49.202 --> 07:53.139
- YEAH, JUST BASICALLY KIND OF
SERVING AS A HEADBOARD.

07:53.173 --> 07:56.976
- AND A SPACESHIP.

07:57.077 --> 08:00.380
THE FURNITURE--IT GIVES ME
THIS, LIKE, DIRTY FEELING.

08:00.413 --> 08:02.615
IT'S LIKE LOOKING
AT AN OIL PAINTING--

08:02.649 --> 08:04.150
PBBT, PBBT--

08:04.184 --> 08:05.785
WITH DIFFERENT COLORS.

08:05.819 --> 08:07.921
AND THEY'RE MIXED TOGETHER.
IT'S, LIKE, BROWN.

08:08.021 --> 08:11.691
IT'S LIKE POOP.

08:11.725 --> 08:14.060
SO YOU'RE LOOKING TO SELL?

08:14.094 --> 08:16.896
- YES. IF I GOT THE RIGHT
PRICE FOR IT, YES.

08:16.930 --> 08:19.032
- OKAY, AND WHERE WOULD YOU GO?
I'M JUST CURIOUS.

08:19.032 --> 08:22.202
- MAYBE GET A SOMEWHAT
SMALLER APARTMENT IN--

08:22.235 --> 08:25.472
YOU KNOW, THAT HAS POTENTIAL
FOR APPRECIATION AND--

08:25.505 --> 08:27.440
- HMM, I THINK
I CAN HELP YOU WITH THAT.

08:27.474 --> 08:28.708
- OKAY.

08:28.742 --> 08:32.178
- YOU BOUGHT THIS FOR 2.2?
- 2.25.

08:32.212 --> 08:35.048
- THIS WAS FIVE YEARS AGO?

08:35.048 --> 08:36.649
- I THINK IT WAS
FIVE YEARS AGO, YEAH.

08:36.683 --> 08:40.687
- WHAT IS A PRICE THAT YOU
WOULD BE EXCITED TO SELL?

08:40.720 --> 08:45.091
- I WOULD WANT AT LEAST
THREE MILLION FOR IT.

08:45.125 --> 08:47.293
- HMM.
'CAUSE I AM SO CRAZY.

08:47.327 --> 08:49.529
I DREAM ABOUT COMMISSIONS.

08:49.562 --> 08:51.364
- OF COURSE YOU DO.
- AND, UM--

08:51.398 --> 08:53.433
- YEAH, I DO, AND, UH...

08:53.466 --> 08:56.603
I CAN GET YOU MORE THAN THREE.

08:56.636 --> 08:58.972
TIM'S NEIGHBORHOOD,
CHELSEA, IS SO HOT.

08:59.072 --> 09:01.574
THE LAST FIVE YEARS,
IT'S LITERALLY EXPLODED,

09:01.608 --> 09:03.143
AND PRICES ARE WAY UP.

09:03.176 --> 09:04.511
I HAVE AN IDEA.

09:04.544 --> 09:08.248
BUT IT'S GONNA INVOLVE
YOU WORKING WITH ME

09:08.281 --> 09:12.752
IN TERMS OF THIS FURNITURE.

09:12.786 --> 09:14.187
IT'S COLORLESS.
IT'S SOULLESS.

09:14.220 --> 09:18.024
IT'S ALL GOTTA GO.

09:18.024 --> 09:22.228
AND THAT SCARY THING THERE.

09:22.262 --> 09:24.030
SOMETIMES THE TRUTH
IS HARD TO HEAR.

09:24.030 --> 09:25.799
BUT IT'S MY JOB AS HIS BROKER

09:25.832 --> 09:28.635
TO CUT THROUGH THE BULL[bleep]
AND TELL HIM HOW IT IS.

09:28.668 --> 09:30.203
"YOUR FURNITURE IS UGLY."

09:30.236 --> 09:32.706
I'M THINKING--
I HAVE A STAGER.

09:32.739 --> 09:35.041
- HOW EXACTLY DOES THAT WORK?

09:35.041 --> 09:37.143
- THERE'S DIFFERENT, UM...
OPTIONS.

09:37.177 --> 09:38.912
YOU CAN RENT THE FURNITURE.

09:38.945 --> 09:41.915
WE'LL HAVE TO HAVE HER COME
OVER AND GIVE US A QUOTE.

09:41.948 --> 09:43.750
COULD BE $10,000,
$20,000, $30,000

09:43.783 --> 09:44.818
FOR THREE MONTHS.

09:44.851 --> 09:48.388
BUT IT'S ALWAYS
THE SELLER WHO PAYS IT.

09:48.421 --> 09:52.559
WOULD YOU BE OPEN TO $20,000
FOR YOU TO BE ABLE TO GET

09:52.592 --> 09:54.661
$250,000 MORE?

09:54.694 --> 09:55.929
I THINK I CAN GET YOU--

09:55.962 --> 09:58.898
I KNOW I CAN GET YOU 3 1/4.

10:01.167 --> 10:03.136
- LET'S DO IT.
- OKAY, THAT'S GREAT.

10:03.169 --> 10:04.437
AND SINCE WE ARE FRIENDS

10:04.471 --> 10:06.006
AND YOU'RE
A GOOD CLIENT OF MINE,

10:06.039 --> 10:09.776
I'M GIVING YOU
THE GOOD COMMISSION RATE OF 6%.

10:09.809 --> 10:13.113
- I THOUGHT THAT WAS
THE STANDARD COMMISSION RATE.

10:13.146 --> 10:15.548
- WELL, I'M GIVING YOU 6%.
- [chuckles]

10:17.717 --> 10:19.352
- COMING UP...

10:19.386 --> 10:21.688
- VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY GOOD
QUALITY GRANITE COUNTERTOPS.

10:21.721 --> 10:26.459
- SORRY.
I HATE GRANITE.

10:38.171 --> 10:40.006
- OH, NICE.
IT'S A NICE SPACE.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.342
- IT IS A NICE SPACE.
IT NEEDS SOME STUFF.

10:42.375 --> 10:43.943
- TIM HAS BEEN AWAY
IN VEGAS FOR A FEW DAYS,

10:43.977 --> 10:46.746
WHILE CHERYL HAS BEEN IN HIS
APARTMENT WORKING HER MAGIC.

10:46.780 --> 10:48.214
- SO I GUESS
WE SHOULD GET STARTED.

10:48.248 --> 10:50.016
- OKAY.

10:50.050 --> 10:52.185
- CHERYL AND I HAVE WORKED
MANY TIMES BEFORE,

10:52.218 --> 10:54.487
AND SHE CAN TURN SOMETHING
OLD AND BORING-LOOKING

10:54.521 --> 10:56.723
INTO SOMETHING
BEAUTIFUL AND FRESH.

10:56.756 --> 11:00.260
I CANNOT WAIT TO SEE HIS
UGLY FURNITURE OUT OF THERE.

11:04.397 --> 11:05.799
- HEY, FREDRIK.

11:05.832 --> 11:09.569
- [gasps]
OH, MY GOD.

11:09.602 --> 11:12.939
YOU HAVE DONE IT AGAIN.
- YEAH, YOU LIKE IT?

11:12.972 --> 11:14.841
- AND IT FEELS LIKE
IT'S MORE AIRY SOMEHOW.

11:14.874 --> 11:16.343
IT FEELS LIKE
THE CEILINGS ARE HIGHER.

11:16.376 --> 11:17.644
- YEAH?
- I MEAN, THEY'RE NOT.

11:17.677 --> 11:22.082
BUT IT FEELS--OOH.

11:22.082 --> 11:24.884
TIM HAS NO IDEA
WHAT CHERYL HAS BEEN UP TO.

11:24.918 --> 11:26.586
FINGERS CROSSED
HE'S GONNA LIKE IT.

11:26.619 --> 11:30.490
I'M SO CURIOUS
TO SEE YOUR REACTION.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.599
- THIS IS
REALLY BEAUTIFUL, CHERYL.

11:39.632 --> 11:41.201
I LOVE THE SECTIONAL.

11:41.234 --> 11:43.103
- AND LOOK OVER HERE, BECAUSE
THERE WAS SOMETHING, LIKE,

11:43.103 --> 11:44.637
REALLY BIG
AND EVIL THERE BEFORE.

11:44.671 --> 11:47.007
- [laughs]
WOULD YOU LAY OFF MY PLANT--

11:47.107 --> 11:48.742
OH, FREDRIK.
- AW.

11:48.775 --> 11:50.143
- THANK YOU.

11:50.176 --> 11:51.678
- YOU KNOW,
SOMETIMES LESS IS MORE.

11:51.711 --> 11:53.413
SO I'M JUST GONNA PUT IT
RIGHT HERE.

11:53.446 --> 11:54.881
THIS DOESN'T BITE PEOPLE.

11:54.914 --> 11:58.518
- OKAY,
I WANNA SEE THE REST OF IT.

11:58.551 --> 12:00.553
- TIM, REMEMBER
THE SPACESHIP AND EVERYTHING?

12:00.587 --> 12:03.256
- [laughs]
- THAT'S AMAZING.

12:03.289 --> 12:05.258
both:
OH, MY GOD.

12:05.291 --> 12:07.827
- I HAVE TO CONGRATULATE TIM,
BECAUSE HE DID LISTEN TO ME.

12:07.861 --> 12:11.331
AND BECAUSE OF THAT, I'M GOING
TO GET HIM $250,000 MORE.

12:11.364 --> 12:14.534
- TIM, LOOK AT YOUR BEAUTIFUL,
NEW OUTDOOR LOUNGE.

12:14.567 --> 12:17.570
- NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.

12:23.443 --> 12:25.612
- BEAUTIFUL.
- UNBELIEVABLE.

12:25.645 --> 12:27.347
OF ALL THE THINGS THAT
SHE DID TO THE APARTMENT,

12:27.380 --> 12:30.583
I GOTTA SAY, THE TERRACES
WERE REALLY BEAUTIFUL.

12:30.617 --> 12:32.786
YOU ACTUALLY WANTED
TO OPEN THOSE DOORS.

12:32.819 --> 12:34.587
YOU WANNA GO OUT.
YOU WANNA SIT DOWN--

12:34.621 --> 12:36.456
ALL THOSE BEAUTIFUL PLANTS.

12:36.489 --> 12:38.591
AND NOW I CAN REALLY
SELL THE APARTMENT.

12:38.625 --> 12:41.327
WHERE IS THAT HIDEOUS PL--

12:41.361 --> 12:43.763
GET IT OUT. GET IT OUT.
[laughter]

12:43.797 --> 12:45.699
- OKAY, GLAD YOU'RE OKAY.

12:45.732 --> 12:48.234
- WE'VE DONE IT AGAIN.

12:58.478 --> 13:00.747
- BEFORE I CAN EVEN MAKE IT HOME
THIS AFTERNOON,

13:00.780 --> 13:02.115
AARON CALLED ME

13:02.148 --> 13:04.517
AND SAID THAT HIS BUYERS
ARE READY TO NEGOTIATE.

13:04.551 --> 13:07.587
HOPEFULLY, THEY DON'T LOW-BALL
ME LIKE LAST TIME.

13:07.620 --> 13:11.057
- HE'S WILLING TO MAKE
AN OFFER, ALL CASH...

13:11.057 --> 13:12.292
1.4.

13:12.325 --> 13:14.194
- EUROS?

13:14.227 --> 13:16.429
- UH, U.S.
- U.S. DOLLARS?

13:16.463 --> 13:17.931
- UM...
- HE CAN WIRE THE MONEY.

13:17.964 --> 13:20.266
YOU CAN HAVE
EVERYTHING TOMORROW.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.769
- ALL RIGHT...

13:22.802 --> 13:24.771
I MEAN, 1.4 IS JUST WAY
TOO LOW FOR THIS.

13:24.804 --> 13:26.272
I MEAN,
ON A PER-SQUARE-FOOT BASIS,

13:26.306 --> 13:28.241
IT'D BE THE LOWEST THING
TO EVER TRADE IN THIS BUILDING,

13:28.274 --> 13:30.844
PROBABLY WITHIN
TWO SQUARE BLOCKS.

13:30.877 --> 13:33.113
1.4 MILLION?
I MEAN, ARE YOU KIDDING ME?

13:33.146 --> 13:36.549
THIS BROKER BETTER BE WILLING TO
WORK WITH ME A LITTLE BIT HERE.

13:36.583 --> 13:38.985
- THE VIEWS ARE JUST NOT,
NOT THERE.

13:39.085 --> 13:41.654
I MEAN, I THINK IF IT
WAS ON FOUR FLOORS HIGHER--

13:41.688 --> 13:43.390
- I MEAN IT'S AN UR--
YEAH, IT'S NOT A WATER VIEW.

13:43.423 --> 13:44.557
BUT IT'S A COOL URBAN VIEW.

13:44.591 --> 13:45.892
I MEAN, THIS IS--

13:45.925 --> 13:48.261
YOU KNOW, VERY FEW PEOPLE
GET THIS VIEW IN NEW YORK.

13:48.294 --> 13:49.963
- I THINK WITH ALL CASH,
IT'S A VERY GOOD OFFER--

13:49.996 --> 13:52.832
- MOST OF THE BUYERS IN THE
BUILDING ARE ALL CASH NOWADAYS.

13:52.866 --> 13:54.668
YOU KNOW, HE'S GONNA BUY.
HE'S GONNA HOLD IT.

13:54.701 --> 13:55.902
HE'S GONNA RENT IT OUT.

13:55.935 --> 13:56.736
HE'S GONNA GET REVENUE
COMING IN.

13:56.770 --> 13:58.004
HE'S GONNA DO VERY WELL.

13:58.104 --> 14:00.040
- HOW MUCH ROOM DO YOU THINK
THEY HAVE TO NEGOTIATE?

14:00.040 --> 14:01.508
- YOU KNOW,
THERE'S NOT MUCH ROOM.

14:01.541 --> 14:04.944
IT'S GONNA BE
VERY, VERY CLOSE TO 1.6.

14:05.045 --> 14:07.447
I SAY...

14:07.480 --> 14:09.649
I KNOW FOR 1.575,
I GET A DEAL DONE.

14:09.683 --> 14:12.052
SO, LIKE, YES OR NO
AT THAT PRICE, AND WE CAN DO IT.

14:12.052 --> 14:14.654
- SERIOUSLY, 1.575--
THAT'S THE FINAL NUMBER?

14:14.688 --> 14:17.357
- YEAH, 1.575.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.192
HOLLY HAS ALREADY
BROUGHT DOWN THE ASKING PRICE

14:19.225 --> 14:21.494
ON THIS ONE-BEDROOM
TO 1.6 MILLION.

14:21.528 --> 14:23.663
AND WE'VE TALKED, SO I KNOW
HER BOTTOM-LINE NUMBER.

14:23.697 --> 14:25.932
THE MINIMUM AMOUNT THE SPONSOR
WILL TAKE TO SELL IT

14:25.965 --> 14:27.867
IS AROUND 1.55.

14:27.901 --> 14:31.071
SO ANYTHING I GET ABOVE THAT,
HOLLY'S GONNA BE DELIGHTED.

14:33.073 --> 14:34.607
- LET ME GIVE HIM A CALL NOW,

14:34.641 --> 14:37.644
SEE WHAT HE SAYS, AND THEN
IT'S--IT'LL BE YES OR NO.

14:37.677 --> 14:39.145
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

14:39.179 --> 14:41.548
LET'S HOPE FOR A<i>OUI.</i>
[laughs]

14:41.581 --> 14:44.351
I'M A LITTLE SURPRISED BY HOW
FAST THIS IS ALL MOVING ALONG.

14:44.384 --> 14:47.320
BUT PIERRE WANTS THIS
AS AN INVESTMENT PROPERTY.

14:47.354 --> 14:49.222
I DON'T THINK HE REALLY CARES
WHAT APARTMENT HE GETS,

14:49.255 --> 14:51.725
JUST SO LONG AS HE'S IN
THE JEAN NOUVEL BUILDING

14:51.758 --> 14:52.959
BEFORE IT'S SOLD OUT.

14:52.992 --> 14:57.497
- THEY CAME BACK
WITH 1.575.

14:57.530 --> 14:59.332
- 1.575?

14:59.366 --> 15:01.034
- YES.

15:01.067 --> 15:04.371
- DOES THAT WORK?

15:04.404 --> 15:05.939
- UM...

15:13.046 --> 15:15.615
- SO?

15:15.648 --> 15:17.784
- WE HAVE OURSELVES A DEAL.
WE'RE GOOD--

15:17.817 --> 15:20.186
1.575.
- OH, REALLY? WELL, GREAT.

15:20.220 --> 15:21.221
THIS IS GREAT.

15:21.254 --> 15:22.622
IT'S A BIG ACCOMPLISHMENT.

15:22.655 --> 15:25.125
DEFINITELY GET THE PAPERWORK
ROLLING IMMEDIATELY.

15:25.158 --> 15:27.127
- YEAH, WE CAN GET IT OUT TODAY.
THAT'S NOT A PROBLEM.

15:27.160 --> 15:29.496
IT'S A HUGE RAINBOW
OF EMOTIONS

15:29.529 --> 15:31.197
CHANNELING THROUGH
MY BODY RIGHT NOW.

15:31.231 --> 15:32.399
IT FEELS GOOD.

15:32.432 --> 15:34.200
- THANK YOU. GOOD DOING
BUSINESS WITH YOU, OKAY?

15:34.234 --> 15:35.935
- OKAY, GREAT.
TAKE CARE.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.076
- SO I GOT ONE MORE FOR YOU.

15:43.109 --> 15:45.378
I'VE TAKEN ALL
YOUR WANTS AND DESIRES,

15:45.412 --> 15:46.780
AND I THINK I'VE FOUND IT.

15:46.813 --> 15:49.549
NOW, WE'RE GOING
A LITTLE BIT OUTSIDE THE BOX.

15:49.582 --> 15:51.251
WE'RE GONNA GO OVER
TO THE WEST SIDE.

15:51.284 --> 15:52.652
- DON'T REALLY LIKE
THE WEST SIDE.

15:52.686 --> 15:53.820
- BUT--
- I'M GONNA CHANGE YOUR MIND.

15:53.853 --> 15:55.088
- IT DEPENDS, THOUGH.
IF IT'S THE--

15:55.121 --> 15:56.656
- YOU HAVEN'T EVEN BEEN
TO THE WEST SIDE YET.

15:56.690 --> 15:57.924
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

15:57.957 --> 16:00.326
- HOW CLOSE IS THIS PLACE
TO CIVILIZATION?

16:00.360 --> 16:02.696
- UH...
- TO BE ON THE RIVER--

16:02.729 --> 16:04.330
THAT SOUNDS A LITTLE BIT--
- LOOK AROUND.

16:04.364 --> 16:05.532
- WE HAVEN'T EVEN SEEN
THE PLACE YET,

16:05.565 --> 16:06.866
AND THESE TWO
ARE ALREADY FIGHTING.

16:06.900 --> 16:08.168
- WELL, NO, THIS PLACE--

16:08.201 --> 16:10.303
- FIRST OF ALL, YOU JUST
GOTTA WAIT TILL WE GET THERE.

16:17.510 --> 16:19.279
LET'S GO TO THE LIVING ROOM--
THIS WAY.

16:25.218 --> 16:27.954
YOU CAN SEE ALMOST THE ENTIRE
GEORGE WASHINGTON BRIDGE.

16:36.830 --> 16:40.967
VERY, VERY, VERY, VERY GOOD
QUALITY GRANITE COUNTERTOPS.

16:43.603 --> 16:45.138
ALL RIGHT?
- DO YOU LIKE THIS?

16:45.171 --> 16:47.073
- AND--
- SORRY. I HATE GRANITE.

16:47.107 --> 16:50.577
THE GRANITE COUNTERTOPS CAN GO.
DON'T LIKE THE HARDWARE.

16:50.610 --> 16:53.079
I'M JUST FEELING, YOU KNOW,
DRAB COOKIE CUTTER.

16:53.079 --> 16:55.782
- THE LAST THREE APARTMENTS
WE SAW, THERE WAS FURNITURE.

16:55.815 --> 16:56.916
- BUT I'LL TRY IT.

16:56.950 --> 16:58.251
- HERE IT'S, LIKE,
COMPLETELY EMPTY,

16:58.284 --> 17:00.153
SO I CAN'T REALLY QUITE,
YOU KNOW, VISUALIZE MUCH.

17:00.186 --> 17:02.022
- I CAN'T EITHER. IT LOOKS
REALLY SMALL, BY THE WAY.

17:02.022 --> 17:03.323
- WHICH IS--WAIT A MINUTE.

17:03.356 --> 17:04.924
WHICH IS WHY I'VE ENLISTED
A LITTLE BIT OF HELP.

17:05.025 --> 17:06.559
HEY. ROBERT?
- HOW ARE YOU?

17:06.593 --> 17:08.028
- HEY, PERFECT TIMING.

17:08.028 --> 17:09.929
IT WOULDN'T TAKE
A GENIUS TO KNOW

17:10.030 --> 17:11.698
THAT THESE TWO ARE PROBABLY
GOING TO COMPLAIN

17:11.731 --> 17:13.600
ABOUT THE LACK
OF FURNISHINGS.

17:13.633 --> 17:16.636
SO I PLANTED MY GO-TO DESIGNER,
ROBERT, OUTSIDE THE FRONT DOOR

17:16.670 --> 17:18.705
AND TOLD HIM IF IT SOUNDS
LIKE I NEED HELP,

17:18.738 --> 17:20.340
COME IN AND RESCUE ME.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.242
- HI, I'M ROB.
- HI. NICE TO MEET YOU. NICK.

17:22.275 --> 17:23.376
- HI.
- PLEASURE TO MEET YOU.

17:23.410 --> 17:24.644
- GOOD TO MEET YOU.

17:24.678 --> 17:26.813
- I KNOW THAT THIS
IS KIND OF A WHITE BOX, RIGHT?

17:26.846 --> 17:29.949
AND YOU MIGHT HAVE
SOME TROUBLE VISUALIZING IT,

17:30.050 --> 17:31.518
'CAUSE EVERYTHING ELSE WE'VE
SEEN HAS BEEN TOTALLY FURNISHED.

17:31.551 --> 17:33.386
YOU'VE BEEN ABLE TO WALK IN--
- IT LOOKS SMALL.

17:33.420 --> 17:35.755
- RYAN HAD SENT ME
SOME FLOOR PLANS,

17:35.789 --> 17:38.792
HE'S VERY DESCRIPTIVE
ABOUT THE TWO OF YOU.

17:41.161 --> 17:44.764
I THINK THE WORD "COLORFUL"
WAS THROWN IN THERE...

17:44.798 --> 17:46.733
- I'M VIBRANT.
- [laughs]

17:46.766 --> 17:47.801
- TAN, TAN.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.235
- WE ACTUALLY PREPARED
SOME SAMPLES.

17:49.269 --> 17:52.072
I COULD HELP YOU
VISUALIZE THE SPACE.

17:52.105 --> 17:54.307
- HONESTLY,
IF THIS ONE DOESN'T WORK...

17:54.341 --> 17:56.276
I'M NERVOUS I'M GONNA SPEND
THE REST OF MY CAREER

17:56.309 --> 17:57.544
JUST DRIVING THEM AROUND--

17:57.577 --> 17:59.379
JUST DRIVING THEM
AROUND SHOWING THEM

17:59.412 --> 18:03.083
EVERY SINGLE APARTMENT
IN NEW YORK CITY.

18:03.116 --> 18:05.719
- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO CHARM
THIS UP, BECAUSE I--

18:05.752 --> 18:07.354
YEAH, SOMEONE'S--I CAN'T.

18:19.599 --> 18:24.037
- [humming]

18:24.070 --> 18:25.605
YOU.

18:25.638 --> 18:28.074
I'M GONNA SELL THIS,
GET RID OF YOU.

18:28.108 --> 18:30.610
AND YOU'RE NOT GETTING
ANY WATER.

18:30.643 --> 18:34.147
THE VERY FIRST CALL ON
A PROPERTY IS ALWAYS EXCITING.

18:34.180 --> 18:36.149
WE STAGED THIS APARTMENT
TO PERFECTION.

18:36.182 --> 18:38.051
- HELLO, I'M FREDRIK.
- HELLO, HOW ARE YOU?

18:38.051 --> 18:40.286
- NOW I JUST HAVE
TO SEAL THE DEAL.

18:40.320 --> 18:42.055
SO THANK YOU FOR COMING.

18:42.055 --> 18:43.857
- YOU'RE WELCOME.
SO HAPPY TO SEE--

18:43.890 --> 18:46.426
- YOU'RE THE FIRST PERSON
IN THIS APARTMENT.

18:46.459 --> 18:48.261
SO YOU'RE BOTH BROKERS.
- EXCITED.

18:48.294 --> 18:49.829
- YOU HAVE A BUYER.
- MM-HMM.

18:49.863 --> 18:51.431
- AND YOU'RE PREVIEWING
FOR THE BUYER?

18:51.464 --> 18:53.600
- ABSOLUTELY.
HE'S IN FRANCE STILL.

18:53.633 --> 18:55.468
- HE IS A SURGEON,
AND THEY'RE LOOKING

18:55.502 --> 18:58.571
FOR A PIED-A-TERRE IN MANHATTAN.
- OKAY.

18:58.605 --> 19:00.607
- IF YOU DON'T MIND,
WE'D LIKE TO FILM IT FOR THEM...

19:00.640 --> 19:01.741
- SURE. GO AHEAD.
- SO THAT THEY CAN--

19:01.775 --> 19:03.109
- AND YOU'RE GONNA
SEND IT TO FRANCE.

19:03.143 --> 19:04.310
- AND WE'LL SEND
IT DIRECTLY THERE.

19:04.344 --> 19:05.345
- I GOTTA SAY,
IT'S A TREND RIGHT NOW.

19:05.378 --> 19:07.113
A LOT OF PEOPLE
IN EUROPE ARE BUYING,

19:07.147 --> 19:08.648
AND THEY'RE BUYING QUICKLY.

19:08.682 --> 19:11.084
THEY DON'T EVEN HAVE TIME TO GO
AND LOOK AT THE APARTMENTS.

19:11.117 --> 19:12.919
I'VE SOLD LOTS
OF APARTMENTS OVER THE PHONE.

19:13.019 --> 19:16.089
HI, I THINK YOU'RE GONNA
LIKE THIS APARTMENT.

19:18.758 --> 19:20.827
SO THIS ENTIRE THING
IS A MASTER SUITE.

19:20.860 --> 19:22.829
- WOW.
- YOU HAVE ONE TERRACE HERE...

19:22.862 --> 19:24.364
- WONDERFUL.
- AND YOU HAVE ANOTHER TERRACE

19:24.397 --> 19:26.266
OVER HERE.
- SOUNDS GREAT.

19:26.299 --> 19:28.668
- AND THIS IS THE BEST PART--
LOOK AT THIS.

19:28.702 --> 19:30.937
- WHAT A GREAT VIEW
OF THE EMPIRE STATE!

19:31.037 --> 19:32.605
CAN'T GET BETTER THAN THAT.
- YOU HAVE SUN.

19:32.639 --> 19:34.574
YOU HAVE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING
AT NIGHT.

19:34.607 --> 19:37.110
- GREAT TERRACE.
- IT'S VERY PRIVATE TOO.

19:37.143 --> 19:40.347
LET ME FILM SO YOU CAN SAY HI
TO YOUR--TO YVES.

19:40.380 --> 19:41.481
- OKAY.

19:45.919 --> 19:47.287
- HOT LISTING.

19:47.320 --> 19:48.388
- IT'S A HOT LISTING.

19:48.421 --> 19:49.889
- I'M REALLY GLAD
THAT YOU CAME.

19:49.923 --> 19:52.592
- I THINK THE BUYER
WILL REALLY LIKE THE APARTMENT.

19:52.625 --> 19:53.927
- YEAH,
I THINK A LOT OF PEOPLE

19:53.960 --> 19:55.362
AT THE OPEN HOUSE
WILL LOVE THE APARTMENT.

19:55.395 --> 19:57.664
I WASN'T GONNA SHOW IT UNTIL
THE OPEN HOUSE THIS SUNDAY,

19:57.697 --> 20:00.900
BUT, YOU KNOW,
DOING AN EXCEPTION FOR YOU.

20:00.934 --> 20:03.269
I SNEAK IN THE WORD
"OPEN HOUSE" THERE

20:03.303 --> 20:04.904
TO PUT SOME PRESSURE ON THEM.

20:04.938 --> 20:07.741
I WANT THEM TO FEEL LIKE
THEY COULD LOSE THIS APARTMENT.

20:07.774 --> 20:09.342
I'M ALWAYS THINKING STRATEGY.

20:09.376 --> 20:11.077
- WE'LL HAVE AN ANSWER...
- THE WHOLE THING IS GREAT.

20:11.111 --> 20:12.645
- FOR YOU AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

20:12.679 --> 20:13.747
- HURRY, HURRY.

20:13.780 --> 20:15.482
THANKS FOR COMING.
I REALLY APPRECIATE IT.

20:15.515 --> 20:17.217
- THANK YOU.
<i>AU REVOIR.</i>

20:17.250 --> 20:19.152
- COMING UP...

20:19.185 --> 20:28.795
- I'M STARTING TO FREAK OUT HERE
A LITTLE BIT.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.697
- SO I BROUGHT SOME FABRICS
AND SOME CARPETS...

20:30.730 --> 20:32.465
- OKAY.
- AND JUST SOME THOUGHTS.

20:32.499 --> 20:34.167
WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR APPROACH
TO THIS WOULD BE?

20:34.200 --> 20:36.603
- WHAT'S--
- DRAMA, HIGH DRAMA.

20:36.636 --> 20:40.106
- ARE YOU A DRAMA QUEEN?
- DARK AND MYSTERIOUS, YES.

20:40.140 --> 20:41.775
AND THAT'S WHY THE WHITE--

20:41.808 --> 20:43.543
I CAN'T FIGURE IT OUT IN HERE,
BECAUSE IT'S SO WHITE.

20:43.576 --> 20:45.311
- I THINK THIS IS A REALLY
GREAT, DRAMATIC KITCHEN.

20:45.345 --> 20:48.381
- THAT'S A BLACK KITCHEN.

20:48.415 --> 20:50.817
- PERHAPS, YOU KNOW,
WE COULD MAKE THE ENTIRE...

20:50.850 --> 20:52.318
- THAT'S SUSPENSEFUL.
- APARTMENT FEEL LIKE THIS.

20:52.352 --> 20:54.087
IT'S...
- OH.

20:54.120 --> 20:56.289
- IT'S REALLY SEXY.
I FEEL LIKE IT'S TIMELESS.

20:56.322 --> 20:58.858
I THOUGHT PERHAPS
WE COULD DO LACQUERED WALLS

20:58.892 --> 21:02.062
AND MAYBE USE SOMETHING
LIKE THIS IN THE KITCHEN.

21:04.130 --> 21:06.599
- I WOULD LOVE THAT, 'CAUSE I
WANT TO DO SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

21:06.633 --> 21:08.468
- YEAH, AND SO I PICKED
LOTS OF FABRICS

21:08.501 --> 21:11.705
AND CARPETS THAT HAVE MOVEMENT,
AND THIS WOULD, YOU KNOW...

21:11.738 --> 21:13.440
- THAT IS AMAZING.
- APPEAL TO YOUR SEXIER SIDE.

21:13.473 --> 21:15.375
- OH, MY--
THE LEOPARD QUEEN THAT I AM.

21:15.408 --> 21:17.077
- WE COULD EVEN USE SOME,
YOU KNOW, MOVEMENT

21:17.077 --> 21:18.144
ON THE WINDOW TREATMENTS.

21:18.178 --> 21:19.412
- OH, MY GOD.
- THIS IS SOMETHING THAT--

21:19.446 --> 21:21.147
- LOVE THE APPLIQUE.
- WE COULD USE.

21:21.181 --> 21:23.216
- LOVE IT. THIS IS WORKING.
- I ACTUALLY THOUGHT THAT--

21:23.249 --> 21:25.118
- SO THIS WAS A GOOD PLAN,
GOOD IDEA?

21:25.151 --> 21:26.686
- OH, MY GOD.

21:28.388 --> 21:30.090
- SO WE ACTUALLY
THOUGHT THIS BEDROOM

21:30.090 --> 21:31.658
WOULD BE GREAT
FOR YOUR DAUGHTER.

21:31.691 --> 21:34.761
I HAD DONE A FLOOR PLAN
WHERE WE HAD A DAYBED HERE,

21:34.794 --> 21:37.197
COULD DO A LITTLE BUILT-IN HERE
WITH THE DESK.

21:37.230 --> 21:38.431
- AS SOON AS ROBERT

21:38.465 --> 21:40.500
STARTS SHOWING THEM
POTENTIAL FOR THIS PLACE,

21:40.533 --> 21:43.903
SOMETHING INSIDE
OF THIS COUPLE CLICKS.

21:43.937 --> 21:45.805
WE COULD DO A BUILT-IN HERE...
- YEAH.

21:45.839 --> 21:47.841
- OR SOME TYPE OF CABINETRY
FOR YOUR SHOE COLLECTION.

21:47.874 --> 21:49.142
- LOVE IT.
- BIG WINDOWS.

21:49.175 --> 21:50.610
THIS IS WHAT I WANTED--
BIG WINDOWS.

21:50.643 --> 21:53.546
OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE A BIG PATIO.
I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THAT.

21:55.382 --> 21:57.117
- I LOVE IT.

21:57.117 --> 21:58.785
- THIS IS AMAZING.
- OH, MY GOD.

21:58.818 --> 22:00.053
- THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT I WANTED.

22:00.053 --> 22:02.055
- YOU DID GOOD. YOU DID GOOD.
- [laughs]

22:02.055 --> 22:03.823
THANK YOU, GOD.

22:03.857 --> 22:05.625
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I WAS GETTING READY TO FIRE YOU.

22:05.658 --> 22:07.660
- REALLY?
- YEAH. I WAS THINKING...

22:07.694 --> 22:10.296
"THIS GUY"--
NO, I'M JUST KIDDING.

22:20.774 --> 22:21.941
- HI, GUYS.
- HELLO.

22:21.975 --> 22:23.476
HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

22:23.510 --> 22:25.078
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.
- HOW ARE YOU?

22:25.078 --> 22:26.146
- HI.

22:26.179 --> 22:27.614
- THE DAY
RIGHT BEFORE THE OPEN HOUSE,

22:27.647 --> 22:29.883
I GET A PHONE CALL
FROM DEMETRIUS AND SOPHIE

22:29.916 --> 22:32.252
AND I CAN FEEL AN OFFER COMING.

22:32.285 --> 22:34.621
SO YOU HAVE SOMETHING
TO TELL ME MAYBE?

22:34.654 --> 22:36.356
17TH STREET, I'M ASSUMING.

22:36.389 --> 22:38.191
- THEY LOVE IT, SO...
- OKAY.

22:38.224 --> 22:41.194
- WE WANT TO STAY NUMBER ONE
AND GET IT FOR HIM.

22:41.227 --> 22:42.595
- SO...

22:42.629 --> 22:44.330
THIS IS ALL VERY EXCITING.

22:44.364 --> 22:46.933
I WISH I COULD HAVE
SOME COFFEE.

22:46.966 --> 22:49.869
WHAT IS THE OFFER?

22:49.903 --> 22:52.939
- THREE MILLION.

22:52.972 --> 22:56.443
- NO, NO, NO, THE PRICE IS
THREE MILLION AND A QUARTER.

22:56.476 --> 22:58.011
YOU KNOW THAT.
- YES.

22:58.111 --> 23:00.413
- IF YOU DON'T WANT ME
TO DO AN OPEN HOUSE--

23:00.447 --> 23:02.182
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

23:02.215 --> 23:04.517
IF YOU WANT
TO LOCK THIS UP NOW

23:04.551 --> 23:06.519
AND HAVE ME CANCEL
THE FIRST OPEN HOUSE,

23:06.553 --> 23:09.489
THEN YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO COME IN AT FULL ASK.

23:15.195 --> 23:16.296
YOU'RE THE FIRST PEOPLE IN.

23:16.329 --> 23:17.964
WHY WOULD I GO
TO MY SELLER AND SAY

23:18.064 --> 23:19.966
HERE IS AN OFFER
OF THREE MILLION,

23:20.066 --> 23:21.701
$250,000 OFF ASK,

23:21.735 --> 23:23.770
WHEN WE HAVEN'T EVEN TRIED OUT
THE MARKET YET?

23:23.803 --> 23:25.338
I WOULD BE A FOOL
TO ADVISE MY CLIENT

23:25.372 --> 23:26.773
TO TAKE SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

23:26.806 --> 23:29.175
- YOU SHOULD SPEAK TO THE SELLER
AND PRESENT THE OFFER.

23:29.209 --> 23:32.746
- YEAH, LET ME--
LET ME CALL MY CLIENT.

23:32.779 --> 23:34.447
I JUST KNOW
THE ANSWER ALREADY.

23:34.481 --> 23:37.517
OKAY?
- MM-HMM.

23:37.550 --> 23:38.885
- OH, THIS IS SO BORING.

23:38.918 --> 23:40.653
BY LAW, I HAVE TO PRESENT
ALL OFFERS,

23:40.687 --> 23:42.255
EVEN THIS [bleep] ONE
OF THREE MILLION.

23:42.288 --> 23:44.991
HEY, TIM, FREDRIK HERE.

23:45.091 --> 23:46.359
HOWEVER, IT'S KIND OF FUN,

23:46.393 --> 23:47.927
BECAUSE IT'S GONNA
MAKE ME LOOK EVEN BETTER

23:47.961 --> 23:52.599
FOR TIM, MY SELLER, MY CLIENT,
WHEN I DO GET HIM 3 1/4 SHORTLY.

23:52.632 --> 23:53.967
I'M HERE WITH THE BROKERS

23:54.000 --> 23:57.337
FOR THAT ONE, FIRST, AND ONLY
SHOWING YOU KNOW I DID.

23:57.370 --> 23:59.939
AND BELIEVE IT OR NOT,
THEY HAVE SUBMITTED AN OFFER,

24:00.040 --> 24:01.641
BUT AT THREE MILLION.

24:01.675 --> 24:03.710
DON'T RESPOND, DON'T RESPOND.
I KNOW, I KNOW, I KNOW.

24:03.743 --> 24:05.145
I KNOW.

24:05.178 --> 24:07.347
I'M GONNA GET YOU--
I'M GONNA GET--I KNOW, I KNOW.

24:07.380 --> 24:09.416
I'M GONNA GET YOU FULL ASK.
I PROMISE YOU.

24:13.853 --> 24:16.489
OKAY.

24:16.523 --> 24:18.725
JUST LIKE I EXPECTED...

24:18.758 --> 24:21.795
FULL ASK--

24:21.828 --> 24:23.329
NOTHING ELSE.

24:23.363 --> 24:25.398
YOU DON'T WANT US TO DO
AN OPEN HOUSE.

24:25.432 --> 24:28.068
I COULD TEXT MY ASSISTANT RIGHT
NOW AND SCHEDULE THE OPEN HOUSE.

24:31.071 --> 24:34.507
- CAN YOU GIVE HIM A CALL?

24:34.541 --> 24:36.543
- YES.
- OKAY.

24:38.645 --> 24:42.282
- MY ONE WORRY IS THAT
THIS IS GONNA HAPPEN SO FAST.

24:42.315 --> 24:44.384
I HAVE TO FIND HIM
A NEW PLACE TO LIVE.

24:44.417 --> 24:46.119
TIM CAN'T BE HOMELESS, RIGHT?

24:46.152 --> 24:51.224
- [speaking French]

24:51.257 --> 24:52.659
- SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

24:52.692 --> 24:55.829
- I THINK IF HE'S PREPARED
TO GO UP TO THERE, HE WILL.

24:57.464 --> 25:00.767
[man speaking French
over phone]

25:09.943 --> 25:12.312
- WE HAVE A DEAL!
- OH, FANTASTIC.

25:12.345 --> 25:13.747
- YES.
- GOOD JOB.

25:13.780 --> 25:16.216
- TO YOU AND TO ME
AND TO YOU TOO.

25:16.249 --> 25:18.385
THIS WAS EASY AS A PIE,
OR AS THEY SAY IN SWEDEN--

25:18.418 --> 25:20.186
[speaks Swedish]

25:20.220 --> 25:23.757
UM, HOW DO YOU SAY--
"FANTISTICO"?

25:23.790 --> 25:25.358
NO, IN FRENCH--
-<i>FANTASTIQUE.</i>

25:25.392 --> 25:27.260
- AND HOW DO YOU SAY...
[imitates whip cracking]

25:27.293 --> 25:28.561
IN FRENCH?

25:34.734 --> 25:39.205
- AT 2:30, I HAVE OLIVER,
AND HE'S CREDIT SUISSE, RIGHT?

25:39.239 --> 25:41.474
AND IS MY 3:30 STILL IN THERE?
AND THAT'S 865TH.

25:41.508 --> 25:43.743
OH, MAN, AM I GONNA
HAVE TO TAKE THE TRAIN?

25:43.777 --> 25:45.412
[groans]
BUT IT'S SO HOT IN THERE.

25:45.445 --> 25:46.846
BUT CAN YOU MEET ME?

25:46.880 --> 25:48.581
CAN YOU TAKE THE CAR
AND YOU CAN MEET ME UP THERE?

25:48.615 --> 25:50.917
AND THEN YOU'LL DRIVE ME OVER
TO 5TH AVENUE--THAT'S PERFECT.

25:50.950 --> 25:52.485
AND THEN THAT SOLVES
THE REST OF MY AFTERNOON.

25:52.519 --> 25:53.820
- LOOK IN THE MIRROR.
- HIGH FIVE.

25:53.853 --> 25:55.255
- YOU'RE THE ONE
WITH SUNGLASSES AND A SUIT.

25:55.288 --> 25:57.157
YOU LOOK MORE LIKE A CHAUFFEUR
THAN I DO--AM I CORRECT?

25:57.190 --> 26:00.026
- DINA IS MY LOVELY ASSISTANT.

26:00.026 --> 26:02.028
AND SOMETIMES SHE IS SWEET,

26:02.062 --> 26:04.864
AND SOMETIMES
SHE DRIVES ME INSANE.

26:04.898 --> 26:07.534
SEE, LOOK, NOW YOU
JUST MADE ME MISS MY CALL.

26:07.567 --> 26:09.469
[bleep], IT WAS NICK.
- PARKER?

26:09.502 --> 26:11.204
- LEAVE A VOICE MAIL,
LEAVE A VOICE MAIL,

26:11.237 --> 26:12.539
LEAVE A VOICE MAIL.

26:12.572 --> 26:16.209
THEY LIKED THE RUSHMORE.
- CONGRATS, CONGRATS, CONGRATS.

26:16.242 --> 26:18.078
- OFFER, RUSHMORE--2.85.

26:18.111 --> 26:19.312
HIGH FIVE, HIGH FIVE.

26:19.346 --> 26:21.147
- JUST DRIVE.
- HIGH FIVE, HIGH FIVE.

26:21.181 --> 26:22.782
I'M NOT GONNA PUT MY HANDS
ON THE WHEEL

26:22.816 --> 26:24.317
UNLESS YOU HIGH-FIVE ME.

26:24.351 --> 26:26.152
I'M GONNA START GOING FASTER.
COULD YOU PLEASE HIGH-FIVE ME?

26:26.186 --> 26:27.487
PLEASE HIGH-FIVE ME.
IT'S GONNA GET WEIRD.

26:27.520 --> 26:29.356
[bleep] DAMN IT.

26:38.064 --> 26:40.233
- HEY, FREDRIK.
- HOW ARE YOU? GOOD TO SEE YOU.

26:40.266 --> 26:41.801
THANKS FOR COMING OUT.
- GOOD TO SEE YOU.

26:41.835 --> 26:44.971
- SO CONGRATULATIONS.
- THANK YOU, THANK YOU.

26:45.071 --> 26:47.440
I HAD NO IDEA IT WAS GONNA SELL
THAT QUICKLY.

26:47.474 --> 26:48.742
IT WAS QUICK, RIGHT?

26:48.775 --> 26:51.111
- I'M STARTING TO FREAK OUT
HERE A LITTLE BIT.

26:51.144 --> 26:53.079
I DON'T KNOW
WHERE I'M GONNA LIVE.

26:53.113 --> 26:54.714
- NOW THAT I'VE SOLD
TIM'S PLACE,

26:54.748 --> 26:57.183
I NEED TO FIND HIM
A NEW HOUSE.

26:57.217 --> 26:59.719
I ALWAYS GO AFTER
THE DOUBLE COMMISSION.

26:59.753 --> 27:01.688
CHING, CHING!

27:01.721 --> 27:03.023
DO NOT WORRY.

27:03.056 --> 27:04.858
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
THAT'S EASY FOR YOU TO SAY.

27:04.891 --> 27:07.093
[laughs]
- WHAT WOULD YOU WANT--

27:07.127 --> 27:08.528
CHELSEA MAYBE,
STAY IN CHELSEA?

27:08.561 --> 27:11.031
- I WOULD PREFER
TO ACTUALLY STAY IN CHELSEA.

27:11.064 --> 27:13.500
- AND YOU SEEM TO BE VERY FOND
OF THE FURNITURE.

27:13.533 --> 27:15.669
NOW WHEN WE'RE DONE
WITH THE '80s STUFF,

27:15.702 --> 27:17.103
WOULD YOU WANNA KEEP IT
MORE MODERN?

27:17.137 --> 27:20.573
- YEAH, I WOULD ACTUALLY LIKE,
YOU KNOW, NICE, NEW CONSTRUCTION

27:20.607 --> 27:23.243
IF I KNOW
THAT IT WAS DONE WELL.

27:23.276 --> 27:25.045
- YOU KNOW,
BEFORE YOU GOT HERE,

27:25.045 --> 27:26.680
I'VE BEEN DOING
SOME SEARCHES FOR YOU.

27:26.713 --> 27:28.782
I WENT OVER
150 APARTMENTS ONLINE.

27:28.815 --> 27:30.316
SO I PULLED THIS FOR YOU.

27:30.350 --> 27:34.754
IN CHELSEA, SUPER ULTRA-MODERN
AND NEW CONSTRUCTION--

27:34.788 --> 27:36.923
VERY DRAMATIC, VERY BRIGHT.

27:36.956 --> 27:39.592
YOU KNOW
THAT TALL, GRAY BUILDING

27:39.626 --> 27:42.062
WITH ALL THAT GLASS
ON 11TH AND 19TH?

27:42.062 --> 27:44.097
I'M SURE YOU'VE SEEN IT.
- OH, THE ONE RIGHT ACROSS

27:44.130 --> 27:45.565
FROM THE FRANK GEHRY BUILDING
ON 19TH?

27:45.598 --> 27:47.867
- YEAH, I HAVE SEEN THAT.
IT'S--

27:47.901 --> 27:50.370
- JEAN NOUVEL'S MASTERPIECE.
I MEAN, I LOVE IT.

27:50.403 --> 27:53.173
LISTED AT 3.5 MILLION.

27:53.206 --> 27:54.307
- THIS LOOKS BEAUTIFUL.

27:54.341 --> 27:55.875
- YES.
- THIS IS...

27:55.909 --> 27:57.544
THE SORT OF THING
I'M TALKING ABOUT.

27:57.577 --> 27:59.079
THIS IS REALLY MODERN-LOOKING.

27:59.079 --> 28:00.847
- SO LET ME MAKE
THE APPOINTMENT FOR YOU.

28:00.880 --> 28:02.315
- ALL RIGHT.

28:02.349 --> 28:04.417
- AND THIS GUY HERE,
REPRESENTING IT--

28:04.451 --> 28:06.019
I THINK
I CAN GET A GOOD DEAL.

28:06.019 --> 28:07.120
I KNOW HIM.

28:07.153 --> 28:08.121
AND LOOK AT HIS PHOTO.

28:08.154 --> 28:09.923
DON'T YOU THINK
HE LOOKS A LITTLE...

28:10.023 --> 28:13.560
- [laughs]
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

28:13.593 --> 28:15.028
- KIND OF--I DON'T KNOW.

28:15.028 --> 28:18.164
I WOULD SEE THAT AND KIND OF
THINK HE WAS AN INSURANCE AGENT

28:18.198 --> 28:20.033
- I THINK
I CAN NEGOTIATE WITH HIM.

28:20.033 --> 28:21.801
- [laughs]

28:21.835 --> 28:23.336
- I'M REALLY EXCITED.
IT'S SUCH A GREAT BUILDING.

28:23.370 --> 28:25.605
OF COURSE IT WOULD BE FUN TO...
[clicks tongue]

28:25.638 --> 28:27.374
WITH MICHAEL IN A NEGOTIATION.

28:27.407 --> 28:30.210
BUT MOST IMPORTANTLY,
IT'S ABOUT FINDING A PLACE

28:30.243 --> 28:31.644
THAT'S PERFECT FOR MY CLIENT.

28:31.678 --> 28:34.247
I THINK WE'RE GONNA GET
A GOOD DEAL.

28:34.280 --> 28:36.449
- COMING UP...

28:36.483 --> 28:37.917
- IS IT NO?
YOU'RE SAYING NO TO MY OFFER?

28:37.951 --> 28:39.419
- YOU GUYS ARE GONNA HAVE
TO COME UP.

28:39.452 --> 28:45.925
WE'RE NOT
LOOKING TO BE INSULTED.

28:45.959 --> 28:47.060
- HI.

28:47.060 --> 28:48.361
- THIS IS SINGH.
- GOOD TO MEET YOU.

28:48.395 --> 28:51.131
- SINGH, HI.
MICHAEL.

28:51.164 --> 28:53.099
MY FRIEND JESSICA
HAS BEEN BUGGING ME

28:53.133 --> 28:54.267
TO SIT DOWN WITH HER PSYCHIC.

28:54.300 --> 28:55.702
SO I SAID, "WHAT THE HELL?"

28:55.735 --> 28:58.104
MAYBE I'LL LEARN A THING
OR TWO ABOUT MY FUTURE.

29:00.840 --> 29:02.842
PART JAPANESE?

29:02.876 --> 29:05.612
REALLY?
I'VE NEVER GOT THAT?

29:05.645 --> 29:08.014
[clicks tongue]
I WAS A GEISHA.

29:08.014 --> 29:10.283
OKAY.
[laughter]

29:12.118 --> 29:14.020
OKAY.

29:19.092 --> 29:23.396
SO WHAT KIND OF SICKNESS AM
I GONNA GET WHEN I'M 38, 39?

29:23.430 --> 29:24.597
AH, SOME BLOOD--
- LEUKEMIA.

29:24.631 --> 29:26.566
- YEAH.

29:26.599 --> 29:29.302
- IT'S ONLY A WARNING.

29:29.336 --> 29:31.037
- SO I'LL HAVE, LIKE,
A BLOOD DISEASE IN SEVEN YEARS

29:31.037 --> 29:32.539
AS A "WARNING."
- ONLY IF YOU STRESS.

29:32.572 --> 29:34.507
- I STRESS EVERY DAY.
I'M STRESSING RIGHT NOW.

29:34.541 --> 29:49.389
NOW I KNOW I HAVE
SEVEN GOOD YEARS LEFT.

29:49.422 --> 29:50.790
- ANYBODY HOME?

29:50.824 --> 29:52.559
- SEEING FREDRIK WAS PROBABLY
ONE OF THE LAST THINGS

29:52.592 --> 29:54.427
I WANT TO DO,
BUT I'M A PROFESSIONAL.

29:54.461 --> 29:57.263
SO I'M PRACTICING MY BREATHING.
GONNA BE CALM.

29:57.297 --> 30:00.367
[breathes deeply]

30:00.400 --> 30:01.434
- THIS IS MY CLIENT TIM.

30:01.468 --> 30:02.502
- HI. HOW ARE YOU?
- THIS IS MICHAEL.

30:02.535 --> 30:03.903
- TIM VANDERSLICE.
NICE TO MEET YOU.

30:03.937 --> 30:05.205
- HOW YOU DOING?
PLEASURE. WELCOME TO 111TH.

30:05.238 --> 30:06.339
- THANK YOU.

30:06.373 --> 30:08.541
- FREDRIK AND I WORK
AT THE SAME FIRM.

30:08.575 --> 30:10.910
AND AVOIDING HIM FOREVER
WOULD BE NEARLY IMPOSSIBLE.

30:10.944 --> 30:12.078
SO I'M GONNA SHOW HIM
THE UNIT,

30:12.112 --> 30:14.414
AND, HEY, COULD BE
A BIG COMMISSION.

30:14.447 --> 30:16.516
JEAN NOUVEL DESIGNED
EVERY ASPECT OF THIS BUILDING,

30:16.549 --> 30:19.052
FROM THE WINDOWS,
TO THE FAUCETS, TO THE FLOORS,

30:19.085 --> 30:20.520
TO EVERYTHING.

30:20.553 --> 30:23.390
THIS STREET ESPECIALLY IS JUST,
LIKE, FAMOUS ARCHITECT STREET.

30:23.423 --> 30:26.092
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE FRANK GEHRY.
HERE YOU HAVE JEAN NOUVEL.

30:26.126 --> 30:27.527
- TYPICALLY, BROKERS--
WE TALK TOO MUCH.

30:27.560 --> 30:30.330
WHY DON'T YOU GO AROUND
AND SEE WHAT YOU THINK?

30:30.363 --> 30:31.564
- THIS IS
A REALLY UNIQUE UNIT.

30:31.598 --> 30:33.433
HERE YOU'LL SEE
HOW THE WINDOWS--

30:33.466 --> 30:34.934
UNLIKE THE PASSANT
FACING THE STREET,

30:34.968 --> 30:36.503
JEAN NOUVEL PLACED EACH WINDOW

30:36.536 --> 30:38.872
IN A SPECIFIC WAY
TO TELL A STORY.

30:38.905 --> 30:40.473
SO HERE YOU HAVE A VERY--

30:40.507 --> 30:42.409
FOR THIS BUILDING,
A VERY LARGE PICTURE WINDOW.

30:42.442 --> 30:44.010
- I LOVE THIS WINDOW.

30:44.044 --> 30:47.313
THIS LOOKS LIKE ACTUALLY
A PHOTO OF THE HIGH LINE.

30:47.347 --> 30:49.249
- EXACTLY. EVERYTHING'S
COMPLETELY DIGITAL HERE.

30:49.282 --> 30:53.253
YOU KNOW, YOU TURN IT ON HERE
AND THEN COLDER, WARMER.

30:53.286 --> 30:56.189
AND THEN THE MEDICINE CABINETS
HAVE THE BUILT-IN LIGHT WITHIN.

30:56.222 --> 30:58.425
YOU KNOW, JUST EVERY LITTLE
DETAIL WAS THOUGHT OF.

30:58.458 --> 30:59.793
JEAN NOUVEL
DESIGNED EVERYTHING.

30:59.826 --> 31:02.929
THIS IS WHERE THE COLD AIR
COMES THROUGH THE SYSTEM.

31:02.962 --> 31:04.698
THIS USUALLY GETS
FREEZING COLD AND--

31:04.731 --> 31:06.399
- WELL, THAT'S
THE COLD AIR UP THERE.

31:06.433 --> 31:07.734
THAT'S THE HEAT.

31:07.767 --> 31:10.070
- WELL, THIS IS BOTH.

31:10.070 --> 31:12.072
IT COMES OUT OF THERE.

31:12.105 --> 31:14.908
I THINK IT COMES THROUGH
TO THE BUILDING IN HERE.

31:14.941 --> 31:17.877
- YEAH, BUT I THINK THIS
IS THE H--THIS IS THE HEAT.

31:17.911 --> 31:19.245
I'M JUST--
I LIKE THIS DISCUSSION,

31:19.279 --> 31:21.081
BECAUSE IT'S
VERY IMPORTANT TO HIM.

31:21.081 --> 31:23.283
LIKE, HE ACTUALLY BOUGHT HIS OLD
APARTMENT ON 17TH STREET.

31:23.316 --> 31:25.352
THE MAIN REASON WAS--
- NOTHING COMES OUT OF HERE.

31:25.385 --> 31:26.653
- WELL, HEAT IS COMING OUT.

31:26.686 --> 31:28.088
- THE INTAKE
IS COMING THROUGH HERE.

31:28.121 --> 31:29.422
- EXACTLY.
- IF YOU HAVE A FILTER,

31:29.456 --> 31:30.990
THEN THAT MEANS
THE INTAKE OF AIR IS--

31:31.091 --> 31:34.094
- EVERYTHING COMES OUT
FROM THAT VENT OVER HERE.

31:41.001 --> 31:42.669
FREDRICK,
I KNOW THIS BUILDING.

31:42.702 --> 31:44.838
IF I WANTED YOUR ADVICE
ON THIS BUILDING, I'D ASK YOU.

31:44.871 --> 31:46.206
BUT I KNOW THIS BUILDING.

31:46.239 --> 31:48.908
IF I WAS DOING, YOU KNOW,
A PRIVATE SCENE IN MY APARTMENT

31:48.942 --> 31:51.478
AND FILMING IT LATER TONIGHT,
I'D CALL YOU FOR ADVICE.

31:51.511 --> 31:53.179
- I'VE ALREADY LOOKED
AT ALL THE COMPS.

31:53.213 --> 31:55.315
I HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA
OF WHAT WE WANNA DO HERE.

31:55.348 --> 31:56.349
BUT I'LL GET BACK TO YOU.

31:56.383 --> 31:58.118
- OKAY, GREAT.
- THANKS. APPRECIATE IT.

31:58.118 --> 32:01.054
- THANKS A LOT.
- TAKE CARE. HAVE A GOOD ONE.

32:10.430 --> 32:12.732
- SO MY CLIENTS
REALLY LIKE 20-C, OKAY?

32:12.766 --> 32:13.900
BUT THEY'VE SEEN
A LOT OF APARTMENTS,

32:13.933 --> 32:15.201
SO THEY HAVE A LOT OF OPTIONS.

32:15.235 --> 32:17.070
AS YOU KNOW,
THERE'S A LOT ON THE MARKET.

32:17.070 --> 32:18.872
I'M MEETING UP WITH
THE SALES AGENT FOR THE RUSHMORE

32:18.905 --> 32:20.940
TO DISCUSS
NICK AND PENELOPE'S OFFER.

32:20.974 --> 32:24.544
THE SALES AGENT MELISSA IS THE
ONLY THING STANDING BETWEEN ME

32:24.577 --> 32:27.380
AND GETTING A GOOD NIGHT'S SLEEP
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN WEEKS.

32:27.414 --> 32:29.849
BUT I WAS ABLE TO PULL
AN OFFER OUT OF THEM.

32:29.883 --> 32:32.118
BUT YOU GOTTA HELP ME.
- THAT'S WHAT WE'RE HERE TO DO.

32:32.152 --> 32:34.754
- RIGHT, SO THEIR FIRST OFFER
IS 2.85.

32:36.189 --> 32:39.359
I DON'T KNOW
HOW MUCH ROOM THERE IS.

32:41.428 --> 32:43.229
- YOU KNOW, I THINK WHAT
WE'RE GONNA BE COMFORTABLE WITH

32:43.263 --> 32:47.767
RIGHT NOW IS SOMETHING
MORE LIKE 3.24.

32:47.801 --> 32:49.436
- 3.24?
- MM-HMM.

32:49.469 --> 32:51.938
- FROM 3.381?
- YEAH.

32:51.971 --> 32:54.140
- DO YOU THINK THERE'S ANY WAY
WE'RE GONNA BE ABLE TO GET IT

32:54.174 --> 32:55.842
UNDER THREE OR NO?

32:57.677 --> 32:59.112
SOMETIMES WHEN
I'M IN THE MOMENT,

32:59.112 --> 33:01.581
I GOTTA JUMP BACK INTO THE DAYS
OF WHEN I WAS A SOAP OPERA ACTOR

33:01.614 --> 33:04.284
AND, YOU KNOW,
TURN ON THE SUAVE.

33:04.317 --> 33:06.353
I'LL MAKE EYE CONTACT...

33:06.386 --> 33:08.488
THEN LIP CONTACT.

33:08.521 --> 33:11.624
GET THE JOB DONE.

33:11.658 --> 33:15.295
- I DON'T THINK THAT'S
REALISTIC FOR THIS APARTMENT.

33:15.328 --> 33:17.063
- 3.24 IS JUST--

33:17.063 --> 33:19.165
YOU GOTTA GIVE ME LIKE AT LEAST
A CLOSING-COST CREDIT

33:19.199 --> 33:20.333
OR SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

33:20.367 --> 33:22.268
- WHAT IF WE CONCEDED
THE TRANSFER TAXES?

33:22.302 --> 33:24.704
THAT'S RIGHT AROUND $60,000.

33:24.738 --> 33:28.274
DO YOU THINK THAT'S SOMETHING
THEY COULD GET COMFORTABLE WITH?

33:28.308 --> 33:30.076
- DON'T MOVE.

33:30.076 --> 33:33.613
[line trilling]

33:35.749 --> 33:37.183
GOOD.

33:37.217 --> 33:40.320
SO I AM AT THE SPONSOR'S OFFICE
RIGHT NOW.

33:40.353 --> 33:44.924
AND I GOT THEM DOWN
TO 3,240,000

33:44.958 --> 33:49.095
WITH AN EXTRA CLOSING CREDIT
OF $60,000,

33:49.095 --> 33:50.397
WHICH IS TRANSFER TAXES.

33:50.430 --> 33:54.434
SO THAT'S ROUGHLY
A NET OF 3.18.

33:59.105 --> 34:00.640
I TH--NO, I CAN GET IT LOWER.

34:00.674 --> 34:03.510
I CAN ABSOLUTELY GET IT LOWER,
BUT I WANNA--

34:03.543 --> 34:05.111
ABSOLU--

34:05.145 --> 34:08.581
NO, I KNOW YOU DO.

34:08.615 --> 34:12.419
OKAY, SO I GOT HIM UP A LOT.
- GREAT.

34:12.452 --> 34:14.788
ALL RIGHT, SO HE'S BASICALLY
JUST GONNA SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE.

34:14.821 --> 34:17.657
SO 3.45
WITH TRANSFER AND ATTORNEY.

34:17.691 --> 34:20.527
THEY'RE ROUGHLY
THE SAME CONCESSIONS.

34:20.560 --> 34:22.762
SO YOU KIND OF HAVE TO
GIVE THAT TO ME.

34:22.796 --> 34:24.264
- [laughs]

34:24.297 --> 34:27.467
THAT'S DEEPER THAN I KNOW
THE SPONSOR'S GOING TO WANNA GO.

34:27.500 --> 34:30.537
THEIR ABSOLUTE BOTTOM LINE
ON THIS IS 3.234.

34:30.570 --> 34:33.606
- YOU CAME DOWN $6,000.
- MM-HMM.

34:33.640 --> 34:35.775
- I'M NOT GONNA GO BACK THERE
AND CALL HIM.

34:35.809 --> 34:37.911
I MEAN, I'D RATHER
JUST NOT DO THE DEAL.

34:37.944 --> 34:39.646
THAT'S RIDICULOUS. YOU GOTTA
GIVE ME SOMETHING ELSE.

34:39.679 --> 34:41.147
- IF THERE'S
SOME OTHER SWEETENER

34:41.181 --> 34:42.582
THAT WOULD BE
MEANINGFUL TO THEM...

34:42.615 --> 34:44.784
- LIKE WHAT?
- WHAT ABOUT A STORAGE BIN?

34:44.818 --> 34:46.286
- THAT'S NOT GONNA DO IT.
- IS THAT SOMETHING--

34:46.319 --> 34:47.420
- WHAT'S THE BIGGEST
STORAGE BIN YOU HAVE?

34:47.454 --> 34:48.888
- WHAT IF WE MADE IT
THE BIGGEST ONE?

34:48.922 --> 34:51.224
- HOW MUCH IS IT?
- 25,000.

34:51.257 --> 34:52.826
- AND THAT'S THE BOTTOM,
YOU'RE SAYING?

34:52.859 --> 34:55.362
- I KNOW THAT'S
THE ABSOLUTE BOTTOM.

34:57.630 --> 34:59.733
- I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

34:59.766 --> 35:03.570
SO YOUR PURCHASE PRICE
IS 3,234,0000.

35:03.603 --> 35:05.872
PLUS, I GOT THEM TO THROW IN
A $25,000 STORAGE BIN,

35:05.905 --> 35:08.208
WHICH IS THE BIGGEST
STORAGE BIN IN THE BUILDING.

35:08.241 --> 35:10.610
PLUS, THEY'RE GONNA COVER
CITY AND STATE TRANSFER TAXES,

35:10.643 --> 35:12.078
WHICH IS, LIKE, $60,000.

35:12.112 --> 35:15.048
SO YOUR FINAL PURCHASE PRICE
THAT'S GONNA BE ON THE CONTRACT

35:15.081 --> 35:18.151
IS 3,234,000.

35:18.184 --> 35:21.454
BUT YOU'RE NET PRICE
IS 3,150,000.

35:21.488 --> 35:23.189
THAT'S WHAT
YOU'RE REALLY PAYING,

35:23.223 --> 35:25.291
WHICH IS GOOD, TOO, BECAUSE THE
PURCHASE PRICE WILL BE HIGHER

35:25.325 --> 35:27.627
ON THE CONTRACT--IT'S GONNA
READ HIGHER RECORDED PRICE.

35:27.660 --> 35:29.396
WHEN YOU GO TO SELL IT
AS AN INVESTMENT,

35:29.429 --> 35:31.364
EVERYONE'S GONNA THINK
YOU PAID A LOT MORE FOR IT

35:31.398 --> 35:33.733
THAN YOU ACTUALLY DID.

35:39.739 --> 35:41.107
WE'RE AT THE BOTTOM.

35:47.914 --> 35:49.549
IF YOU WERE
IN FRONT OF ME RIGHT NOW,

35:49.582 --> 35:51.885
I WOULDN'T EVEN BLINK.

35:52.986 --> 35:54.988
OH, MAN.

35:55.088 --> 35:56.656
OKAY, UM...

35:56.690 --> 35:59.125
SO I TALKED TO HIM.

35:59.159 --> 36:02.762
UH...

36:02.796 --> 36:06.099
YOU KNOW...

36:08.301 --> 36:10.270
I MEAN, IT LOOKS LIKE
WE HAVE A DEAL.

36:10.303 --> 36:11.771
- FANTASTIC.
- OKAY--

36:11.805 --> 36:14.207
WITH THE CONCESSIONS, THOUGH.
- ABSOLUTELY.

36:14.240 --> 36:15.875
- AND I NEED CONTRACTS OUT
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

36:15.909 --> 36:18.244
- WE CAN DO THAT.

36:18.278 --> 36:20.880
- DO YOU HAVE
ANOTHER APPOINTMENT?

36:24.084 --> 36:26.086
YOU DON'T HAVE ANYTHING TO DO
FOR A LITTLE BIT, RIGHT?

36:26.119 --> 36:27.821
- I'M HERE.
I'M HERE.

36:43.203 --> 36:44.637
- I JUST GOT A CALL
FROM FREDRIK.

36:44.671 --> 36:47.607
APPARENTLY HIS CLIENT'S READY
TO MAKE AN OFFER AT 111TH.

36:47.640 --> 36:49.476
- MICHAEL?
- HEY.

36:49.509 --> 36:51.711
- FREDRIK IS VERY AGGRESSIVE
AND VERY STUBBORN.

36:51.745 --> 36:54.147
SO I REALLY NEED TO STEP UP
MY GAME AND PROVE MYSELF.

36:54.180 --> 36:55.482
HE CAN PUSH ME AROUND
ALL HE WANTS,

36:55.515 --> 36:56.850
BUT I'M GONNA GET
THE LAST LAUGH.

36:56.883 --> 36:59.486
- THANK YOU FOR YESTERDAY.
- NO, HAPPY TO SEE YOU GUYS.

36:59.519 --> 37:01.154
HAPPY TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

37:01.187 --> 37:03.390
FREDRIK BROUGHT HIS CLIENT
TO THE NEGOTIATION--

37:03.423 --> 37:05.025
WEIRD.

37:05.025 --> 37:06.092
THIS IS A FIRST FOR ME.

37:06.126 --> 37:07.427
- TIM, ARE YOU OKAY
WITH WAITING?

37:07.460 --> 37:08.528
- SURE.

37:08.561 --> 37:10.897
- I'LL SIT HIM
OVER IN THIS OTHER ROOM,

37:10.930 --> 37:12.432
AND I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

37:12.465 --> 37:15.101
THE BIGGEST LESSON
ONE CAN LEARN IN REAL ESTATE

37:15.135 --> 37:17.437
IS THAT TIME KILLS ALL DEALS.

37:17.470 --> 37:19.205
AND WITH TIM,
HE'S SO HARD TO NAIL DOWN.

37:19.239 --> 37:21.608
I THOUGHT, "IF I BRING HIM
TO THE ACTUAL NEGOTIATION,

37:21.641 --> 37:24.044
"PUT HIM IN THE OTHER ROOM,
RUN BACK AND FORTH,

37:24.044 --> 37:27.280
I CAN CLOSE THIS TODAY,
RIGHT NOW."

37:27.313 --> 37:28.615
THANK YOU
FOR SHOWING US THE UNIT.

37:28.648 --> 37:30.784
- ANYTIME.
- HE LIKES IT.

37:30.817 --> 37:32.886
- YEAH?
- YEAH, HE SEEMED TO LIKE IT.

37:32.919 --> 37:35.455
- THE PROBLEM NOW IS THE PRICE.

37:35.488 --> 37:39.893
I'M AUTHORIZED TO SUBMIT
AN OFFER OF 2,650,000.

37:39.926 --> 37:42.929
- FOR THE TWO-BEDROOM
I SHOWED YOU?

37:42.962 --> 37:46.433
- THE ONLY APARTMENT
THAT YOU DID SHOW US, YES.

37:46.466 --> 37:49.169
TIM HAD AUTHORIZED ME
TO DO THE DEAL AT 2.9,

37:49.202 --> 37:50.670
BUT I CAN'T COME IN AT 2.9.

37:50.704 --> 37:52.772
MICHAEL WOULD JUST PUSH ME UP
AND UP AND UP FROM THERE.

37:52.806 --> 37:54.841
AND MY...

37:54.874 --> 37:57.610
GOAL IS TO END UP BELOW 2.9.

37:57.644 --> 38:00.914
- FOR A JEAN NOUVEL
TWO-BEDROOM--2,650,000?

38:01.014 --> 38:03.016
- MM. MM.

38:03.049 --> 38:04.017
- MM, YES?

38:04.050 --> 38:05.185
MM, NO?

38:05.218 --> 38:06.519
NO, WE SAID THE NUMBER,
2,650,000.

38:06.553 --> 38:08.788
MM, I LIKE
THE SOUND OF THAT.

38:08.822 --> 38:11.224
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA HEAR THAT
FROM ME.

38:11.257 --> 38:13.026
THAT UNIT
ON HIGHER FLOORS WENT FOR,

38:13.059 --> 38:14.728
YOU KNOW,
CLOSE TO $4 MILLION.

38:14.761 --> 38:17.030
YOU KNOW, GRANTED,
IT HAD BETTER VIEWS.

38:17.063 --> 38:18.765
- BUT NOW AT 3,050,000,
IT'S SUCH A PRICE TO GO--

38:18.798 --> 38:20.300
$1,500 A FOOT.

38:20.333 --> 38:22.936
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO EDUCATE ME
ON WHAT SOLD IN THE BUILDING.

38:23.036 --> 38:26.272
- WELL, I DID
WITH THE AIR CONDITIONING.

38:26.306 --> 38:27.640
- MM.

38:27.674 --> 38:29.642
- IF HE CAME UP HERE,
OBVIOUSLY HE WANTS IT.

38:29.676 --> 38:30.877
OBVIOUSLY HE'S MOTIVATED.

38:30.910 --> 38:32.212
YOU DON'T WANNA GO OUT THERE
AND TELL HIM.

38:32.245 --> 38:33.513
"HEY, WE DIDN'T GET IT."

38:33.546 --> 38:35.248
- WELL, HE WANTS IT
AT THE RIGHT PRICE, YEAH.

38:35.281 --> 38:36.449
- YOU GUYS ARE GONNA
HAVE TO COME UP.

38:36.483 --> 38:38.918
OBVIOUSLY, WE'RE NOT LOOKING
TO BE INSULTED.

38:38.952 --> 38:40.687
- IS IT NO?
YOU'RE SAYING NO TO MY OFFER?

38:40.720 --> 38:43.323
- I CAN'T SAY YES OR NO.
- MAYBE A COUNTER.

38:43.356 --> 38:45.592
- AND YOU CAN'T OFFER ME
MORE MONEY RIGHT NOW.

38:45.625 --> 38:47.227
- BUT, MICHAEL,
IF YOU WANT HIM TO COME UP,

38:47.260 --> 38:48.661
YOU HAVE TO GIVE ME A COUNTER.

38:54.334 --> 38:56.736
YOU WANNA MAKE A CALL?

38:56.770 --> 38:59.439
- SEE WHAT SHE WANTS TO DO.
- GREAT. THANK YOU.

38:59.472 --> 39:00.707
- FREDRIK AIN'T STUPID.

39:00.740 --> 39:02.375
HE KNOWS THE APARTMENT'S
WORTH A LOT MORE,

39:02.409 --> 39:03.743
AND HE BROUGHT
HIS CLIENT UP HERE.

39:03.777 --> 39:05.779
YOU WOULDN'T SCHLEP YOUR CLIENT
ALL THE WAY UPTOWN

39:05.812 --> 39:07.647
TO SIT IN SOME GUY'S OFFICE
IF YOU'RE GONNA COME OUT

39:07.681 --> 39:09.315
30 MINUTES LATER
WITH BAD NEWS.

39:09.349 --> 39:11.518
HE KNOWS HE'S GOING CLOSER
TO THREE.

39:14.454 --> 39:16.656
[line trilling]

39:18.024 --> 39:20.060
HEY, HOLLY.
HOW ARE YOU?

39:20.093 --> 39:23.530
I SHOWED 5-D TO FREDRIK,

39:23.563 --> 39:25.198
AND HE HAS A CLIENT

39:25.231 --> 39:27.100
WHO JUST SUBMITTED
AN OFFER TO ME.

39:27.133 --> 39:29.336
AND THEY CAME IN,
WHICH I THINK IS SO LOW,

39:29.369 --> 39:31.371
AT 2,650,000.

39:36.142 --> 39:38.845
I MEAN, HE BROUGHT THE FREAKIN'
BUYER TO THE NEGOTIATION.

39:38.878 --> 39:41.881
SO, I MEAN, OBVIOUSLY
THIS GUY WANTS A DEAL TODAY.

39:41.915 --> 39:45.185
SO HE'S GONNA HAVE
TO COME UP A FEW HUNDRED GRAND.

39:47.854 --> 39:50.156
OKAY, SO NOT A PENNY
LESS THAN 2.8 MILLION.

39:50.190 --> 39:52.492
NOT A PROBLEM. WE'RE GONNA
BEAT HIM UP A LITTLE.

39:52.525 --> 39:54.594
I KNOW THEY'RE HERE
TO SPEND SOME MONEY.

39:54.627 --> 39:56.196
SO I'M NOT GONNA
LET IT GO FOR 2.8.

39:56.229 --> 39:59.799
I'M GONNA MAKE IT GO HIGHER.

39:59.833 --> 40:03.203
- [gasps] OH, I FELL ASLEEP.
- WAS I GONE SO LONG?

40:03.236 --> 40:04.804
WE CAN GET YOU CHOCOLATE
OR COFFEE OR SOMETHING.

40:04.838 --> 40:06.673
- DO WE HAVE...
2.65?

40:06.706 --> 40:08.875
IS IT ACCEPTED?
- NOT A CHANCE. [laughs]

40:08.908 --> 40:10.944
- SO WHAT'S THE RESPONSE?

40:10.977 --> 40:14.180
- 2.9 MILLION.

40:14.214 --> 40:16.383
- MM.

40:16.416 --> 40:19.185
THAT'S A LITTLE HIGH.

40:19.219 --> 40:22.188
- I CAME DOWN $150,000.

40:22.222 --> 40:23.556
- MM.

40:23.590 --> 40:25.725
- GO TALK
TO YOUR BUDDY OUT THERE.

40:25.759 --> 40:29.496
LET'S GET HIM UP,
AND LET'S CLOSE IT.

40:30.864 --> 40:31.931
- COMING UP...

40:31.965 --> 40:33.700
- I DON'T THINK
2.9 IS YOUR LOWEST.

40:33.733 --> 40:35.101
- I DON'T THINK 2,650,000
IS YOUR HIGHEST.

40:35.135 --> 40:37.504
- HE'S BLUFFING
WITH THE 2.9 BEING THE LOWEST.

40:37.537 --> 40:48.782
I CAN FEEL IT.
- I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

40:48.815 --> 40:51.184
- I DON'T THINK
2.9 IS YOUR LOWEST.

40:51.217 --> 40:52.585
- I DON'T THINK 2,650,000
IS YOUR HIGHEST,

40:52.619 --> 40:53.920
OR YOU WOULD HAVE LEFT
BY NOW.

40:53.953 --> 40:56.356
- I'LL GO TALK TO HIM RIGHT NOW.
- OKAY.

40:56.389 --> 40:58.792
- HE'S BLUFFING
WITH THE 2.9 BEING THE LOWEST.

40:58.825 --> 41:00.560
I CAN FEEL IT.

41:00.593 --> 41:02.929
SO I'M HAVING
A LOT OF FUN IN THERE.

41:02.962 --> 41:05.932
- NO, IT'S GOING WELL.
WE GOT THE 2.9 ALREADY.

41:05.965 --> 41:07.500
- YOU GOT THE 2.9?
- ALREADY.

41:07.534 --> 41:08.735
- EXCELLENT.
- NO, NO, WAIT, WAIT.

41:08.768 --> 41:10.670
NO, NOT YET. I'M NOT TAKING IT.
- [chuckles]

41:10.704 --> 41:13.073
- I'M HAVING HIM SWEAT A LITTLE
BIT, AND WE'RE GONNA GO LOWER.

41:13.073 --> 41:14.841
- YOU THINK YOU CAN GET
LOWER THAN THAT?

41:14.874 --> 41:16.076
- OF COURSE.

41:16.109 --> 41:17.744
I'M PRETTY CONFIDENT
GOING IN THERE

41:17.777 --> 41:19.245
THAT I'M GONNA GET
A LOWER PRICE THAN 2.9.

41:19.279 --> 41:20.947
SO I'M HAVING
A LITTLE BIT OF FUN WITH IT.

41:20.980 --> 41:22.916
BUT AT THE SAME TIME...

41:22.949 --> 41:24.818
THERE'S A LOT
ON THE TABLE HERE.

41:24.851 --> 41:27.220
SO, REALLY GOOD NEWS...
- OKAY.

41:27.253 --> 41:29.456
- I'VE DONE IT AGAIN.

41:29.489 --> 41:32.258
- YOU SOUND
LIKE BRITNEY SPEARS.

41:32.292 --> 41:34.794
- I GOT HIM UP TO 8.

41:34.828 --> 41:36.529
2.8.
AREN'T YOU HAPPY?

41:36.563 --> 41:39.232
WE CAN DO A DEAL.
- WHY? DID I SAY--

41:39.265 --> 41:40.900
- 'CAUSE YOU WERE GONNA
COME DOWN FROM 2.9 TO 2.8.

41:40.934 --> 41:44.804
- SAYS WHO?

41:44.838 --> 41:46.906
SO YOU GOT HIM UP 150,000.

41:46.940 --> 41:48.908
- THAT'S A LOT OF MONEY.
YOU CAME DOWN 150,000.

41:48.942 --> 41:51.411
NOW IT WAS MY TURN, SO...

41:51.444 --> 41:53.013
- SO WHAT'S LEFT, THEN?

41:53.113 --> 41:55.982
- WELL, I DON'T THINK I CAN GET
HIM UP ANY HIGHER--I'M SORRY.

41:56.016 --> 41:57.417
BUT MAYBE IF YOU GIVE IN
A LITTLE BIT.

41:57.450 --> 41:58.818
I MEAN, I DON'T KNOW.

41:58.852 --> 42:00.587
- YOU'RE AT 2.8.
I'M AT 2.9.

42:00.620 --> 42:01.654
- MM-HMM.

42:01.688 --> 42:03.523
- WHY DON'T WE MEET
IN THE MIDDLE...

42:03.556 --> 42:06.126
AT 2,850,000?
- 2.850.

42:06.159 --> 42:07.827
ARE YOU AUTHORIZED
TO DO THAT DEAL?

42:07.861 --> 42:09.396
- I AM.

42:09.429 --> 42:12.899
- BUT YOU JUST SAID 2.9
WAS THE LOWEST.

42:12.932 --> 42:14.401
- I KNOW WHAT I'M DOING.

42:14.434 --> 42:15.602
- OKAY.

42:15.635 --> 42:17.070
- ARE YOU AUTHORIZED TO GO UP--

42:17.070 --> 42:18.471
2.850?
- NO, I'M NOT.

42:18.505 --> 42:20.140
HE TOLD ME 2.8
WAS THE HIGHEST.

42:20.173 --> 42:21.975
- OKAY, SO GO TALK.
- OKAY.

42:22.075 --> 42:25.078
LET ME GO ASK HIM.

42:25.078 --> 42:26.780
OKAY, I JUST GOT
YOUR APARTMENT--

42:26.813 --> 42:29.182
2,850,000.

42:29.215 --> 42:31.151
- EXCELLENT.

42:31.184 --> 42:33.853
- BUT I'M GONNA GO IN AGAIN.

42:33.887 --> 42:36.923
YOU KNOW ME.
LET ME PLAY A LITTLE BIT.

42:36.956 --> 42:38.625
- IT'S JUST TOO HIGH.
I'M SORRY.

42:38.658 --> 42:40.393
- 2,850,000 IS TOO HIGH?

42:40.427 --> 42:42.228
- YOU KNOW, THAT'S
THE THING IN REAL ESTATE.

42:42.262 --> 42:46.466
YOU GOTTA JUST,
YOU KNOW, CUT YOUR...

42:46.499 --> 42:49.903
- I'M DOWN $200,000.

42:49.936 --> 42:51.871
- YEAH.

42:51.905 --> 42:54.741
ANYWAY, IT WAS REALLY--
IT WAS A PLEASURE,

42:54.774 --> 42:56.242
AS ALWAYS.

42:56.276 --> 42:58.111
- THANKS FOR COMING BY.
- JUST KIDDING!

42:58.111 --> 43:00.280
WE HAVE A DEAL!

43:00.313 --> 43:02.048
- I'M TOLD YOU ARE AN ACTOR.

43:02.048 --> 43:04.284
- [laughs]
- SO WHAT?

43:04.317 --> 43:06.319
WE HAVE A DEAL WITH WHAT?

43:06.353 --> 43:09.222
- 2.850.
- OKAY. THAT'S GOOD.

43:09.255 --> 43:12.158
- CHING!
- THAT WAS VERY AMUSING.

43:12.192 --> 43:14.060
- YOU'RE NOT HURT, ARE YOU?
- NO, NO, I'M FINE.

43:14.094 --> 43:15.595
I'LL EVEN GET YOU
SOME MORE CANDY.

43:15.628 --> 43:16.763
- OKAY.
- OKAY.

43:16.796 --> 43:18.264
WELL, SO IS TIM HERE.
LET ME TALK TO HIM.

43:18.298 --> 43:20.133
- YEAH, LET'S GO
CONGRATULATE HIM.

43:20.166 --> 43:22.369
HE WAS LIKE, "BE NICE, FREDRIK.
DON'T PLAY TOO MUCH."

43:22.402 --> 43:24.804
SO I WAS LIKE, "LET ME JUST HAVE
A LITTLE BIT OF FUN AT THE END."
