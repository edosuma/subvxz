- Sorry.
- Uh...

02:54.341 --> 02:56.707
- Do... Do you want these?

02:56.718 --> 02:57.833
- You go ahead.
- No, please.

02:57.844 --> 02:58.799
It's the last one.

02:59.388 --> 03:01.754
Uh, miss, do you have another pair
of these black cashmere gloves?

03:01.765 --> 03:03.426
Whatever's out is what we have.

03:03.433 --> 03:04.548
You don't have a stockroom?

03:04.559 --> 03:05.890
- No.
- Or a basement?

03:05.894 --> 03:07.634
No. We don't have an attic, either.

03:08.980 --> 03:11.221
Um, listen, you take 'em.
I don't need 'em.

03:11.233 --> 03:13.224
No, no, no.
You saw them first. I...

03:13.235 --> 03:14.600
Please. I insist.

03:14.611 --> 03:15.817
I mean, here. Take 'em.

03:16.822 --> 03:18.107
- Oh, oh!
Hey, wait a minute.

03:18.115 --> 03:19.275
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Hey!

03:19.282 --> 03:20.442
- Excuse me, sir.
- Yeah?

03:20.450 --> 03:22.406
- These are ours.
- Oh. Your gloves?

03:22.411 --> 03:23.491
- Yes.
- Well, how come? I mean...

03:23.495 --> 03:26.658
They're just sort of hanging there,
sleeping with their little price tag on.

03:26.665 --> 03:28.530
We were just discussing them, all right?
This is, uh...

03:28.542 --> 03:30.203
Well, I have news for you.

03:30.210 --> 03:32.872
You can go on discussing them
long after I've paid for them.

03:32.879 --> 03:34.164
Calm down, all right?
Just calm down.

03:34.172 --> 03:35.912
Calm down?
It's five days before Christmas.

03:35.924 --> 03:37.414
I'm in the middle of a New York
department store.

03:37.426 --> 03:38.586
He's asking me to calm down.

03:38.593 --> 03:41.676
Well, listen. These were meant to be
a very special gift for someone.

03:41.680 --> 03:43.216
Yeah, we've put quite a lot
of thought into those.

03:43.223 --> 03:44.429
- Ah.
- Isn't that right?

03:44.433 --> 03:46.139
Who are you?
And who were they for?

03:46.143 --> 03:47.178
- My boyfriend.
- My girlfriend.

03:47.644 --> 03:50.852
- His girlfriend.
- Her boyfriend.

03:50.981 --> 03:52.721
One pair of gloves for two people?

03:52.816 --> 03:54.556
- This is hard to explain.
- Well, try.

03:54.568 --> 03:56.104
All right. Go ahead.

03:57.070 --> 04:01.905
Oh. Uh, well, he is at the present time
my boyfriend.

04:03.076 --> 04:04.566
But in 18 months...

04:05.912 --> 04:07.243
after the operation...

04:10.250 --> 04:11.831
- he will be...
- she will be...

04:12.210 --> 04:14.997
...my girlfriend.
Do you understand?

04:15.589 --> 04:16.920
That didn't really work out.

04:16.923 --> 04:19.380
- No, but Merry Christmas anyway.
- Thank you very much.

04:19.384 --> 04:20.248
All right.

04:20.886 --> 04:24.253
Well, you earned these.
That was quick on your feet.

04:24.264 --> 04:27.472
- Thanks. It was a team effort.
- Yeah, it was. It was.

04:28.268 --> 04:30.350
- I don't know how to thank you.
- Well...

04:30.604 --> 04:31.844
Ah, well.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.854
♪ And have a Yule that's cool ♪

04:36.234 --> 04:37.223
They're ready for you guys.

04:37.235 --> 04:38.350
Thank you.

04:38.987 --> 04:41.228
I don't know if what you said to that guy
makes any sense.

04:41.323 --> 04:43.279
It was helpful. I think we scared
the bejesus out of him.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.272
Oh, you were pretty fierce.

04:44.910 --> 04:46.946
This will work, though.
This is quite a coffee.

04:47.120 --> 04:48.781
No, but I'm serious about the check.

04:48.789 --> 04:49.778
It's the least I can do.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.452
Well, thank you, but, see,

04:52.459 --> 04:55.747
now I have to go find something else
for my girlfriend.

04:55.754 --> 04:58.120
- Oh, they were for your girlfriend.
- Yes, they were.

04:58.590 --> 05:00.296
Oh, I can't accept them then.

05:00.300 --> 05:01.460
Well, you have to.
Otherwise you won't treat.

05:01.468 --> 05:02.674
Really.

05:02.928 --> 05:05.260
Let me tell you something.
This is the ultimate blended drink.

05:05.639 --> 05:06.924
Where did you find this place?

05:06.932 --> 05:08.513
I first came in because of the name.

05:08.517 --> 05:09.757
- Hmm.
- Serendipity.

05:09.768 --> 05:11.474
- It's one of my favorite words.
- It is?

05:11.478 --> 05:12.718
- Uh-huh.
- Why?

05:13.021 --> 05:14.761
'Cause it's such a nice sound for what it means:

05:14.773 --> 05:16.309
A fortunate accident.

05:16.608 --> 05:18.724
- Mm.
- Except I don't really believe in accidents.

05:18.735 --> 05:20.441
I think fate's behind everything.

05:20.445 --> 05:21.355
Oh, you do?

05:21.363 --> 05:23.149
- Yeah.
- Fate's behind everything?

05:23.532 --> 05:24.738
Well, I think so.

05:24.741 --> 05:26.697
Everything's predestined?
We don't have any choice at all?

05:27.160 --> 05:28.650
No, I think we make our own decisions.

05:28.662 --> 05:31.119
I just think that fate sends us little signs,

05:31.122 --> 05:32.202
and it's how we read the signs

05:32.207 --> 05:33.617
that determines whether we're happy or not.

05:33.625 --> 05:35.035
Little signals.

05:35.043 --> 05:36.408
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:36.419 --> 05:38.705
Fortunate accidents.
Lucky discoveries.

05:38.713 --> 05:40.203
Like Columbus and America.

05:40.215 --> 05:42.797
Yeah, or Fleming discovering...

05:42.801 --> 05:44.132
- ...penicillin.
- Penicillin. Yeah.

05:44.594 --> 05:46.130
- Fleming is his name?
- Yes.

05:46.137 --> 05:47.422
Or "Jonathan and the Gloves."

05:48.640 --> 05:49.800
I don't know that one.

05:49.808 --> 05:52.174
You don't know that story?
It's an old folk tale. Classic.

05:52.561 --> 05:55.223
Our hero, Jonathan, goes out
in search of black gloves.

05:55.230 --> 05:58.188
And in a perfect act of serendipiocity

05:58.191 --> 05:59.727
or serendipaciousness,

05:59.734 --> 06:03.397
he runs into a beautiful,
attractive English girl

06:03.405 --> 06:04.394
with a boyfriend.

06:05.407 --> 06:06.522
You have a boyfriend, right?

06:07.117 --> 06:08.903
- Yeah, I do.
- That's what I thought.

06:08.910 --> 06:10.446
And you have the glove lady.

06:10.453 --> 06:11.784
Yes, I do.

06:14.249 --> 06:16.205
- Mm-hmm.
- It was a very nice time.

06:20.380 --> 06:22.120
Well, I hope you enjoy the gloves
you bought yourself.

06:22.132 --> 06:23.338
Oh, I'm sure I will.

06:23.341 --> 06:25.332
I usually appreciate my own thoughtfulness.

06:26.595 --> 06:27.550
What do you want for Christmas?

06:27.554 --> 06:29.419
- Golf clubs.
- Oh.

06:30.140 --> 06:31.755
So you're gonna meet your boyfriend now or what?

06:31.766 --> 06:34.348
No, I think he's probably out
doing what you're doing.

06:34.769 --> 06:36.475
Getting a crush on someone else's girlfriend?

06:37.647 --> 06:39.603
No, I'm sorry. I just meant to say
that I had a really great time, and...

06:39.608 --> 06:42.395
Um...you know, maybe you should
give me your phone number,

06:42.402 --> 06:43.437
you know, just in case.

06:43.445 --> 06:46.107
- In case of what?
- You know, in case of life.

06:46.615 --> 06:49.072
I just had a great time,
and I'd never be able to find you again.

06:49.659 --> 06:51.775
Well, if we're meant to meet again, then...

06:51.786 --> 06:52.821
we'll meet again.

06:52.829 --> 06:54.490
It's just not the right time now.

06:54.497 --> 06:56.112
Maybe we were supposed to meet on British time

06:56.124 --> 06:58.080
- and we're five hours too early.

06:58.084 --> 07:00.245
Come on.
I don't even know your name.

07:00.253 --> 07:01.834
My name is Jonathan.

07:02.422 --> 07:03.878
Does that make you wanna tell me something?

07:04.466 --> 07:05.751
Yeah, it does.

07:07.510 --> 07:10.297
Merry Christmas, Jonathan.

08:52.449 --> 08:53.939
on parole.

08:54.701 --> 08:57.317
None of the above. You?

08:57.328 --> 08:59.910
No, no, no. Proud U.S. citizen.
No criminal record.

08:59.914 --> 09:02.747
So you won't tell me your name.
Well, tell me, uh...

09:03.334 --> 09:05.370
what do you miss most about Mother England?

09:05.378 --> 09:06.584
I miss my mom terribly.

09:07.756 --> 09:09.462
If I were her, I'd miss you too.

09:16.848 --> 09:20.090
Okay. Favorite movie.

09:21.102 --> 09:23.218
The correct answer is
<i>Cool Hand Luke.</i>

09:23.563 --> 09:24.598
I've never seen it.

09:24.606 --> 09:26.562
Oh, come on.
You've never seen <i>Cool Hand Luke?</i>

09:27.484 --> 09:30.692
Paul Newman?
Oh, my God. Come on!

09:31.196 --> 09:34.279
"Failure to communicate,"
sadistic cop in sunglasses with no name.

09:34.574 --> 09:36.565
- Reminds me of you in that way.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.033
Um, favorite New York moment.

09:43.291 --> 09:44.997
This one's climbing the charts.

09:46.086 --> 09:47.326
I'm flattered.

09:49.547 --> 09:51.378
Is there anything else you need
to know about me?

09:52.425 --> 09:53.460
Huh.

09:55.678 --> 09:57.134
Favorite sexual position?

09:58.014 --> 09:59.675
Oh!

10:00.183 --> 10:01.764
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

10:02.060 --> 10:04.597
Yeah, yeah.
That's my favorite too.

10:05.230 --> 10:06.436
- You all right?
- Yeah.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.849
- Did you hurt yourself?
- No.

10:07.857 --> 10:08.721
- Yes, a little.
- You did?

10:08.733 --> 10:10.348
- Ouch.
- Oh, let's take a look at that.

10:11.111 --> 10:12.772
Oh, Jesus. Wow.

10:13.196 --> 10:14.982
- That's a deep, deep gash.
- Gaping.

10:15.573 --> 10:16.562
- What?

10:17.492 --> 10:19.107
Well, we'll fix that right up.

10:20.912 --> 10:21.992
There you go.

10:25.250 --> 10:26.160
What?

10:27.502 --> 10:28.867
Oh, you're looking at my freckles?

10:29.587 --> 10:31.293
It's the curse of the English, I'm afraid.

10:31.464 --> 10:33.921
- Fair skin and bad teeth.
- No, you have great teeth.

10:35.718 --> 10:36.833
Those aren't just freckles.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.503
If you look closely, you can see Cassiopeia.

10:40.473 --> 10:42.429
- What?
- Right there.

10:43.643 --> 10:44.632
Hold on a minute.

10:47.063 --> 10:48.269
Okay.

10:49.149 --> 10:51.140
All right.
Here's the story:

10:51.317 --> 10:54.104
A long time ago in Ethiopia,

10:54.112 --> 10:56.603
there was this queen named Cassiopeia,

10:56.614 --> 11:00.653
who thought she was the most
beautiful woman in the entire world,

11:00.660 --> 11:03.197
and there wasn't anybody in the kingdom
who wasn't offended

11:03.204 --> 11:05.536
by this woman's relentless vanity.

11:05.832 --> 11:08.448
And then one day, she really
screwed up and offended the gods.

11:08.459 --> 11:09.369
I don't remember what she did

11:09.377 --> 11:10.457
and I don't remember who she offended.

11:10.461 --> 11:12.292
But it was bad.
She crossed the line.

11:12.589 --> 11:14.830
But anyway, Poseidon, the sea god,

11:15.383 --> 11:18.295
punished Cassiopeia
by placing her in the heavens

11:18.303 --> 11:19.793
upside down in her throne,

11:20.305 --> 11:22.717
stuck for eternity with her skirt
around her shoulders,

11:22.724 --> 11:24.214
and all the blood rushing to her head.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.676
And now she's just a constellation in the sky,

11:28.897 --> 11:31.639
a bunch of English freckles
in the shape of a throne.

11:33.902 --> 11:35.813
So she made one tragic mistake.

11:38.072 --> 11:39.653
And paid for eternity.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.273
Correct.

12:01.095 --> 12:02.676
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.
- Legible, legible.

12:03.514 --> 12:04.799
I can't believe I'm doing this.

12:04.807 --> 12:07.173
Now, please, please.
Let fate take its proper course.

12:14.442 --> 12:15.352
Oh! Oh!

12:20.031 --> 12:22.272
That was an accident.
Write down that again, please.

12:22.283 --> 12:24.615
I can't.
That was a sign.

12:25.119 --> 12:26.450
Fate's telling us to back off.

12:27.580 --> 12:28.865
If fate didn't want us to be together,

12:28.873 --> 12:31.285
then why did we meet tonight, huh?
Gotcha.

12:31.751 --> 12:34.458
Well, I don't know, but it's not
an exact science. It's a feeling.

12:34.462 --> 12:35.577
Well, what if you're wrong, huh?

12:35.588 --> 12:37.453
What if it's all in our hands
and we just walk away?

12:37.465 --> 12:38.955
No names, no phone numbers, nothing.

12:38.967 --> 12:40.332
What do you think’s gonna happen?

12:40.343 --> 12:42.208
Do you think good old fate
is just gonna deliver my information

12:42.220 --> 12:43.209
right to your doorstep?

12:43.221 --> 12:45.303
Do you know that's the best idea
you've had all night?

12:45.723 --> 12:48.180
- What's the best...
- Here you go.

12:48.726 --> 12:49.806
Write your name and number down.

12:49.811 --> 12:51.927
- On a $5.00 bill?
- Mm. Just do it.

12:54.941 --> 12:57.899
You are a strange and interesting woman.

13:00.613 --> 13:01.523
Now what?

13:02.615 --> 13:03.775
Wait there.

13:16.379 --> 13:17.334
Hey!

13:20.091 --> 13:20.921
What the hell was that?

13:21.926 --> 13:24.588
When that $5.00 bill makes its way
back into my hands,

13:24.595 --> 13:25.801
I'll be able to call you.

13:25.805 --> 13:28.091
And when you hear my voice on the other end,

13:28.099 --> 13:29.805
then you'll believe in fate, won't you?

13:29.809 --> 13:32.095
♫ <i>Joy to the World</i>

13:32.770 --> 13:34.761
Hey, what about me?

13:35.106 --> 13:36.016
What do you mean?

13:36.024 --> 13:37.434
Well, we have to send something
out in the universe

13:37.442 --> 13:38.557
with your name on it, don't we?

13:38.568 --> 13:39.774
Come on.
Isn't that the only fair thing?

13:39.777 --> 13:41.108
That Is the only fair thing.

13:41.112 --> 13:43.478
What have I got, even?
Ooh.

13:43.489 --> 13:44.854
No. I have a really good idea.

13:44.866 --> 13:46.026
- What?
- Okay.

13:47.785 --> 13:49.400
That's a lot of tuba.

13:49.412 --> 13:51.027
- Okay, see this book?
- Yeah.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.405
Okay, so when I get home tonight,

13:53.416 --> 13:55.498
I'm gonna write my name and number
inside this book.

13:55.501 --> 13:58.789
And then first thing tomorrow morning,
I'll sell it to a used-book store.

13:59.297 --> 14:01.162
Which one?
You're not gonna tell me.

14:01.174 --> 14:02.129
You're not gonna tell me.
Why not?

14:02.133 --> 14:04.169
Well, now, every time you go past
an old bookstore,

14:04.177 --> 14:05.792
you're gonna have to go inside
to see if it's there.

14:06.971 --> 14:08.427
This is just wrong.

14:08.431 --> 14:10.467
You don't just have the most
incredible night of your life

14:10.475 --> 14:11.510
with a perfect stranger

14:11.517 --> 14:13.053
and then leave it all to chance, do ya?

14:13.853 --> 14:14.763
Do ya?

14:16.439 --> 14:17.645
Come with me a second.

14:17.815 --> 14:19.476
What, are we gonna get a room?

14:20.026 --> 14:22.483
I'm kidding.
But I wanna know you more.

14:22.487 --> 14:25.103
Come on. Where are we going?

14:25.114 --> 14:26.854
- Okay. Now, you stay here.
- Okay.

14:27.867 --> 14:29.448
No, stay here. Stay there.

14:29.452 --> 14:31.067
Don't make me come over there.

14:31.329 --> 14:32.318
- Okay.
- Okay.

14:32.330 --> 14:35.037
Right, if we both randomly pick the same floor,

14:35.041 --> 14:35.996
we're meant to be together now.

14:36.000 --> 14:37.240
You're insane.

14:38.586 --> 14:39.575
Come on.

14:40.588 --> 14:41.452
Okay, get in...

14:42.131 --> 14:43.166
take a breath,

14:43.174 --> 14:44.505
and then when the door closes, hit a button.

14:44.509 --> 14:45.874
I don't understand this.

14:45.885 --> 14:48.251
You don't have to understand.
You just have to have faith.

14:48.262 --> 14:49.251
Filth in what?

14:50.681 --> 14:51.966
Destiny.

14:52.308 --> 14:53.673
Oh. Here.

14:55.978 --> 14:56.933
Hey!

14:58.314 --> 14:59.303
It's Sara.

15:00.400 --> 15:01.515
My name's Sara.

15:33.933 --> 15:36.219
And here it is.
See? You were right.

15:36.227 --> 15:39.390
- Uh...
- Let's go, buddy.

15:40.148 --> 15:42.184
- We're going up here.
- Oh, that's okay.

15:42.191 --> 15:43.271
Josh likes to ride either way.

15:43.276 --> 15:45.608
- Don't you, Josh?
- Arrrrr!

15:45.611 --> 15:47.818
Don't do that!
Don't touch those!

15:47.822 --> 15:50.404
Hey, calm down.
He's just a kid.

16:04.547 --> 16:06.629
Looks like we've stopped.

16:09.927 --> 16:11.087
Ayah!

16:21.481 --> 16:24.894
- Oh. We're going again.
- Thank you.

16:26.777 --> 16:27.983
Where is she? Is she here?

16:27.987 --> 16:29.978
No, no. I don't think so.

16:29.989 --> 16:31.570
Come on, Josh.
Let's go, buddy.

16:38.873 --> 16:40.329
- Okay, stay alert.

16:42.627 --> 16:43.833
- Is she here?
- No, not here.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.201
- Back in the elevator.
- She's not here?

16:45.213 --> 16:47.750
Come on! Come on! Move it!
Come on, boy!

17:37.431 --> 17:39.262
Hey, Sara.
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:39.267 --> 17:41.883
- Hey. I'm sorry.
- What?

17:44.981 --> 17:46.061
I'm sorry.

18:36.657 --> 18:39.023
Usually, I have to beg to be a part of weddings.

18:39.035 --> 18:40.195
And If I do get into the wedding,

18:40.202 --> 18:43.285
of course, they've postponed it
and it's overseas somewhere,

18:43.289 --> 18:45.871
and they've canceled my passport
and I can't be a part of it,

18:45.875 --> 18:47.411
and it's ridiculous and all for naught.

18:47.543 --> 18:50.000
Well, thank you.
I take this very seriously.

18:50.004 --> 18:51.915
It's a gift to be the best man.

18:54.175 --> 18:55.335
They say that once in your lifetime,

18:55.343 --> 18:58.380
someone comes along whom
you're absolutely meant to be with.

18:58.763 --> 19:01.129
Everything feels great, stars are aligned,

19:01.515 --> 19:03.130
body and spirit are In balance.

19:03.684 --> 19:05.845
For my friend Jonathan Trager,

19:05.853 --> 19:07.138
that person...

19:07.146 --> 19:08.135
was me.

19:10.775 --> 19:12.857
But as you know, Jonny and I were simpatico.

19:12.860 --> 19:14.270
We were brothers from another mother.

19:14.278 --> 19:16.519
We were friends since freshman year.

19:16.781 --> 19:18.737
I watched him go out with woman after woman,

19:18.741 --> 19:21.153
and he'd always come crawling...

19:21.494 --> 19:23.109
He would come crawling back to me.

19:23.829 --> 19:25.035
It was embarrassing.

19:25.289 --> 19:26.244
You loved it.

19:26.248 --> 19:29.331
But then one night he came home
and things were different.

19:29.335 --> 19:31.667
His adolescent dream of becoming
a documentary filmmaker

19:31.671 --> 19:32.535
was a thing of the past.

19:32.546 --> 19:33.706
Thank God.

19:34.674 --> 19:38.417
He hardly even responded to my playful
yet tormenting flicks of my finger

19:38.427 --> 19:39.667
against the soft part of his skull

19:40.137 --> 19:41.343
as he studied for finals.

19:42.723 --> 19:45.465
And that is because he had found her:

19:45.476 --> 19:47.307
the woman he was meant to be with.

19:47.853 --> 19:50.845
And if anyone is qualified to know
when he met his soul mate,

19:50.856 --> 19:51.845
it would be me,

19:52.233 --> 19:53.268
his first wife.

19:56.821 --> 19:59.528
She's smart, she's funny, she's beautiful.

19:59.532 --> 20:02.274
In short, she's the kind of woman
that any man would dream about.

20:02.284 --> 20:03.444
And I think we all have.

20:03.452 --> 20:05.943
So it is with sadness

20:06.539 --> 20:08.951
and fond, fond memories,

20:08.958 --> 20:10.414
that I raise my glass

20:10.418 --> 20:12.784
to the new Mrs. Jonathan Trager.

20:12.795 --> 20:13.830
- Aww.
- Hear, hear.

20:13.838 --> 20:15.044
I'll tell you what.

20:15.756 --> 20:18.122
I'll tell you something. my friends,
if I had to lose Jonny to anyone,

20:18.134 --> 20:21.877
I can't imagine a more perfect
woman than Halley.

20:21.887 --> 20:22.797
- To Halley.

20:22.805 --> 20:24.090
Cheers to both of you.

20:30.271 --> 20:32.637
How drunk is he on a scale of one to ten?

20:32.648 --> 20:33.603
Twelve.

20:34.150 --> 20:36.391
You think we'll ever out-romance
Dean and Courtney?

20:36.402 --> 20:38.142
I don't know. I don't think
I've ever seen them fight.

20:38.154 --> 20:39.064
Me neither.

20:39.071 --> 20:40.652
Must be a bitch on their sex life.

20:40.656 --> 20:44.023
We... We have a pomegranate souffle,
which is amazing,

20:44.034 --> 20:45.490
which is different than the sorbet.

20:47.705 --> 20:50.447
Listen, we'd love to join you guys,
but Courtney has to wake up,

20:50.458 --> 20:52.824
so I got to be good.

20:52.835 --> 20:54.996
Halley, listen to me.
It's not too late to back out.

20:55.004 --> 20:56.995
- And I'm up... I'm up 116...
- Good night, Dean.

20:59.800 --> 21:03.042
Mama, you don't want to see this,
but I need... I need to snuggle.

21:03.053 --> 21:05.465
I'm gonna sleep it off.
Listen, you're wonderful.

21:05.473 --> 21:07.338
- Good night.
- You know what? You need me.

21:07.641 --> 21:09.051
Take care. Come on, hon.

21:09.059 --> 21:12.802
You guys, listen, I hate to tell you,
but I gotta go home too.

21:12.813 --> 21:14.098
- I have to.
- Come in for one drink.

21:14.106 --> 21:15.721
I gotta get up at 8:00 in the morning.
My day is crazy tomorrow.

21:15.733 --> 21:16.893
- Come in for one drink.
- He doesn't want to come.

21:16.901 --> 21:19.313
- He doesn't have to come.
- I'll see you in about 20 hours.

21:19.612 --> 21:20.647
- Bye-bye, dear.
- Good night.

21:20.654 --> 21:21.814
- I love you, son.
- Night-night.

21:21.822 --> 21:22.982
- George.
- Take care.

21:23.157 --> 21:24.192
- Good night.
- Take care.

21:24.992 --> 21:26.027
You okay?

21:27.620 --> 21:30.111
- You better be up later.
- Yeah, why?

21:30.122 --> 21:31.908
- Because I'm gonna come home and...
- Uh-huh.

21:31.916 --> 21:33.406
get undressed...

21:33.417 --> 21:35.123
- ...climb into bed...
- Uh-huh.

21:35.294 --> 21:37.706
act like we just got over a terrible fight.

21:40.633 --> 21:41.793
Cab!

21:44.094 --> 21:45.254
See you later now.

22:02.905 --> 22:04.065
Buy a book.

22:04.740 --> 22:06.947
Reading is good for you.
Knowledge.

22:11.831 --> 22:12.786
Read it?

22:25.511 --> 22:27.001
Hold on, hold on.
Listen, listen.

22:27.012 --> 22:28.127
I read it.
I read it a long time ago.

22:28.138 --> 22:30.345
I'll throw in the screenplay
to the <i>Bridges of Madison County.</i>

22:30.349 --> 22:32.556
- I saw the movie. It was great.
- I know you like that.

22:45.948 --> 22:46.937
Okay, and...

22:48.284 --> 22:49.945
And nothing. I mean...

22:49.952 --> 22:53.160
I mean, I did nothing.
I... I just let her walk out of the party

22:53.163 --> 22:54.653
and I didn't say anything to her.

22:54.665 --> 22:57.327
And now she's gone forever.

22:57.793 --> 23:01.206
I mean, she was my soul mate.

23:02.423 --> 23:05.540
Kenny, I honestly think it's dangerous
to use the term "soul mate."

23:06.260 --> 23:09.423
It implies there's some magical element
that we have no control over,

23:09.430 --> 23:11.045
like fate or destiny.

23:11.765 --> 23:15.303
I think holding onto beliefs like that
stops us doing the real work.

23:16.270 --> 23:18.556
And the fact is,
if your therapy here stays on track,

23:18.564 --> 23:20.395
I think you'll find there are
many, many people out there

23:20.399 --> 23:21.809
you could easily be happy with.

23:21.817 --> 23:23.648
You truly believe all that, Sara?

23:25.321 --> 23:27.903
Yeah.
I really do.

23:31.076 --> 23:33.567
- There you go.

you'd use that time up

26:41.141 --> 26:43.302
just getting to the nearest course
out of Manhattan.

26:43.977 --> 26:46.218
All this was a long overdue solution.

It keeps happening.

28:19.823 --> 28:21.233
She was at the golf range.

28:21.241 --> 28:23.106
She's a big girl now with big hips.

he's serenading me, <i>Sara.</i>

28:28.707 --> 28:31.198
I'm telling you, the universe
keeps revealing her to me,

28:31.210 --> 28:32.620

- You're getting married in three days.
- That's my point.

28:34.963 --> 28:37.375
It's entirely duplicitous.
Think about it.

28:37.382 --> 28:40.044
Why would you risk your relationship with Halley

28:40.052 --> 28:42.008
just to search for some pipe dream?

28:42.012 --> 28:43.252
Just hear me out, man.

28:44.932 --> 28:46.672
I'm sure that I love Halley, all right?

28:46.683 --> 28:48.514
And maybe every time
you fall in love with somebody,

28:48.518 --> 28:52.102
it's a completely different experience,
so it's a mistake to compare them.

28:52.105 --> 28:53.185
- I get it, but...
- Right.

28:54.691 --> 28:55.680
All right...

28:56.401 --> 28:59.564
It's like Halley is
<i>The Godfather, Part II.</i>

29:00.781 --> 29:01.736
She's what?

29:01.740 --> 29:04.356
<i>Godfather, Part II.</i>
That was an incredible movie.

29:04.368 --> 29:06.575
Might be better than the original.
All right?

29:06.578 --> 29:08.489
But no matter how much you love
<i>The Godfather, Part II,</i>

29:08.497 --> 29:10.112
you still have to see the original

29:10.624 --> 29:13.161
to understand and appreciate
the sequel, don't ya?

29:14.002 --> 29:15.867
Come on. Is it too much to ask
of my oldest friend to help me out?

29:15.879 --> 29:17.415
You already got
the fairy-tale marriage.

29:17.422 --> 29:19.208
I'm the best man.

29:19.216 --> 29:20.752
You work in the biggest newspaper in the world.

29:20.759 --> 29:21.748
- Now, why don't you help me find her?
- Let me tell you something:

29:21.760 --> 29:25.048
Contrary to popular New York myth,
the <i>Times</i> is not omniscient.

29:25.138 --> 29:27.595
I need a last name.
I need a social security number.

29:27.599 --> 29:30.341
- If we find the book...
- It... It's a dead end. You know that.

29:30.352 --> 29:31.762
Unless we search every bookstore in New York.

29:31.770 --> 29:33.260
You did that. Years ago.

29:33.272 --> 29:35.183
- Do you remember?
- Maybe I missed a store.

29:35.190 --> 29:36.771
Maybe somebody bought it and sold it back.

29:36.775 --> 29:39.812
Here's the deal. You know what?
I don't want any part of this.

29:39.820 --> 29:40.935
All right?

29:56.461 --> 29:58.372
Maybe I am just getting cold feet.

29:58.380 --> 30:00.837
I'm telling you right now,
British women do not age well.

30:01.383 --> 30:04.375
You know, I mean, years ago, yes,
she was a luscious treat.

30:04.386 --> 30:06.877
You know, she probably looked like,
you know, Baby Spice.

30:06.888 --> 30:08.549
But now she could look like...

30:10.350 --> 30:12.136
Old Spice.

30:25.449 --> 30:29.442
- It's a great haircut.
- Oh. Thanks.

30:30.829 --> 30:32.820
- Tell me you love me.
- I love you.

30:32.831 --> 30:35.914
- Tell me something romantic.
- Like what?

30:36.376 --> 30:38.367
I don't know. Like...

30:39.504 --> 30:42.746
how I'm the only girl in the entire universe
meant for you.

30:47.346 --> 30:48.836
Oh, my God, the dinner!

30:50.515 --> 30:52.847
By the way, I emptied your closet.

30:52.851 --> 30:54.512
We gotta pack for the honeymoon.

30:54.519 --> 30:56.851
God, I hate this building.

30:56.855 --> 30:59.141
Shut up!

30:59.149 --> 31:01.014
Don't hit it with the thing.

31:02.527 --> 31:03.937
- Jon!
- What?

31:04.488 --> 31:06.570
I'm gonna go yell at the super.

32:02.504 --> 32:04.415
I don't understand why this is going off.

32:04.423 --> 32:06.288
You said last week it would be fine.

32:06.299 --> 32:07.835
- Hey, Jon.
- Hey.

32:07.843 --> 32:10.380
Jesus, this place looks like a disaster area.

32:10.387 --> 32:13.220
- Thanks, Gerald.
- Gerald, it's in here.

32:13.223 --> 32:15.555
I gotta get going. Coming!

33:05.192 --> 33:08.400
Come on! I wanna see!
I wanna see! I wanna see...

33:08.403 --> 33:11.270
I thought you wanted
a round-cut diamond.

33:11.281 --> 33:12.691
Why? When did I say that?

33:12.699 --> 33:15.782
I'm not exactly sure. But, I mean,
when we were younger, I think.

33:15.785 --> 33:19.243
Oh, God. When I was younger,
I was gonna marry Boris Becker, wasn't I?

33:19.247 --> 33:21.454
- Hey, guys.
- Hey!

33:21.458 --> 33:23.073
- What did you think?
- Well, I mean...

33:23.084 --> 33:25.746
Was that last song really inspired by my sister?

33:25.754 --> 33:27.710
Every artist needs his muse.

33:27.714 --> 33:30.456
- Who wants to hear the good news?
- Hey, I pay you for the good news.

33:30.467 --> 33:32.458
No. You pay me to keep away
the bad news.

33:32.469 --> 33:34.130
Bring it on.

33:34.137 --> 33:37.129
Lars' dates in Stockholm sold out
in eight hours.

33:37.140 --> 33:38.846
Wow!

33:38.850 --> 33:40.511
That means we're gonna have to
add some more shows.

33:40.519 --> 33:42.055
So we'll bump Paris and then we'll...

33:42.062 --> 33:45.145
Sorry. Um, I don't wanna
spoil anyone's party,

33:45.148 --> 33:47.355
but Lars and I have already set the dates
for our honeymoon and our wedding,

33:47.359 --> 33:50.021
and I've told my patients when I'm going.

33:50.028 --> 33:53.361
Well, baby, your patients can do
without you for a couple weeks.

33:53.365 --> 33:54.445
He's right, Sara. I mean,

33:54.449 --> 33:56.815
a couple of extra weeks in Europe
aren't gonna kill you.

33:56.826 --> 33:58.942
Caroline's just pushing you to stay longer

33:58.954 --> 34:01.570
'cause she wants us
to house-sit for you guys.

34:01.790 --> 34:04.657
Yeah, thank you. I was going to ask her
when she was drunk.

34:04.668 --> 34:07.250
- Actually, that's a great idea.
- Yeah?

34:07.254 --> 34:11.964
Yes! Come on, Kip. Let's get out of here
before Sara changes Lars' mind.

34:13.802 --> 34:16.168
- I said something wrong?
- No, it's...

34:16.179 --> 34:20.263
I've just got a very detailed schedule,
and my patients are important too.

34:20.266 --> 34:22.178
I don't like changing the dates
at the last minute.

34:22.185 --> 34:23.049
You know what I mean?

34:23.061 --> 34:24.050
Excuse me. I'm sorry.

34:24.062 --> 34:27.304
But I really need you to approve
these T-shirt designs for Australia.

34:27.315 --> 34:28.929
- Oh, no problem.
- You don't mind, do you?

34:28.942 --> 34:30.728
- Can we do this later?
- Yeah.

34:30.735 --> 34:32.145
She don't mind.

35:18.783 --> 35:21.445
That's chamomile for you ladies.
Nice and hot.

35:21.453 --> 35:22.613
- Very good.
- But, Eve...

35:22.621 --> 35:25.158
Sara, it was a movie poster.
It's no big deal.

35:25.165 --> 35:27.121
It's peculiar though, right?
Don't you think?

35:27.125 --> 35:29.537
Look, I thought you were through
with all this New Age bullshit

35:29.544 --> 35:32.627
like horoscopes and feng-shui
and all that crap.

35:32.631 --> 35:36.965
Eve, for someone who owns a New Age store,
you are alarmingly earthbound.

35:36.968 --> 35:38.799
Oh, yeah?
And for a shrink-in-training,

35:38.803 --> 35:40.964
you are a little bit crazy.
I'll tell you that much.

35:40.972 --> 35:44.214
Excuse me.
Do you carry the Casanova candle?

35:44.225 --> 35:45.931
Yes. As a matter of fact, we do.

35:45.935 --> 35:50.474
You know what? Check on the shelf
across from the Caligula incense.

35:50.482 --> 35:52.689
And they're on sale, so today's your lucky day.

35:52.692 --> 35:55.934
Great. You see, that Is what happens

35:55.945 --> 35:57.731
when people get hooked on the New Age life.

35:57.739 --> 36:00.446
They end up sitting at home
burning candles for Mr. Right,

36:00.450 --> 36:04.318
when Mr. Good Enough For Right Now
is waiting at the corner bar.

36:04.329 --> 36:07.241
- Hi. Oh, yeah.

36:07.248 --> 36:08.863
She's a pain in the ass.

36:13.171 --> 36:16.208
- And I gotta find her.
- I've been here three years.

36:16.216 --> 36:17.205
- So this is...
- Yeah, I understand.

36:17.217 --> 36:19.754
But your computer... your computer system
has been here for a long time.

36:19.761 --> 36:21.968
I think... I think you're just
wasting my time, sir.

36:21.971 --> 36:23.586
- No, no. Here's the thing.
- There's nothing I can do.

36:23.598 --> 36:25.054
- It's very crucial.
- You cannot be over here.

36:25.058 --> 36:27.674
You cannot come over
to this side of the counter.

36:27.686 --> 36:29.347
- Please don't cross this line.
- I understand.

36:29.354 --> 36:30.560
- Thank you.
- We're off to a bad start here.

36:30.563 --> 36:32.178
All I really need, if you could, is just

36:32.190 --> 36:34.226
if you could enter this account number
in the computer

36:34.234 --> 36:35.349
and just tell me her name.

36:35.360 --> 36:37.646
Oh, I see.
When you put it that way...

36:37.654 --> 36:38.734
No.

36:38.738 --> 36:39.818
All right.

36:40.699 --> 36:41.654
Would 20 bucks help?

36:41.658 --> 36:43.865
It might if I was a health inspector.

36:43.868 --> 36:45.859
Listen, this is really important.

36:45.870 --> 36:47.656
Oh, boy, did it again.
Crossed the line.

36:47.664 --> 36:50.201
You have to remain on the other side
of the register.

36:50.208 --> 36:53.450
I don't wanna say it again.
Remain on that side. Thank you.

36:53.461 --> 36:56.168
Let's bottom-line this, huh?
What's it gonna take?

36:56.172 --> 36:57.252
I have to have the name.

36:59.092 --> 37:02.801
Well, I was a little short
on my weekly sales draw.

37:02.804 --> 37:04.260
- Were you?
- I'm just mentioning.

37:05.974 --> 37:10.559
Okay. Um, I'm going to, uh...

37:10.562 --> 37:13.725
- Uh-uh.
- Look where my feet are. All right?

37:19.154 --> 37:20.690
- A lovely choice, sir.
- Thank you.

37:21.990 --> 37:25.448
The account number was 029351...

37:25.452 --> 37:28.785
I thought you said you were gonna
help with my weekly draw.

37:28.788 --> 37:31.951
The tie's worth $95.
We're still 700 short.

37:31.958 --> 37:33.243
$700?

37:33.251 --> 37:34.331
- 700.
- That's extortion.

37:34.335 --> 37:38.078
- That's good salesmanship, sir.

37:38.089 --> 37:40.171
What do I need?
Ring it up.

37:40.925 --> 37:42.916
- Well, we have a purple tie.
- Mm-hmm.

37:42.927 --> 37:44.792
What would go with a purple tie?

37:44.804 --> 37:47.136
I look like a magician.

37:47.140 --> 37:49.882
All right, you horrible little man.

37:49.893 --> 37:52.805
I bought the entire spring line.
Okay, you happy?

37:52.812 --> 37:54.052
Now, look her up.

37:54.063 --> 37:55.599
I already did.

37:55.607 --> 37:59.099
It was a dead account.
There's no information in our computers.

37:59.110 --> 38:00.441
- You give me that!
- Hey, chase me.

38:00.445 --> 38:02.936
- Chase you? What? Are you insane?
- Don't cross the line!

38:02.947 --> 38:06.439
- You crossed the line!
- Stop saying that or I will cut you!

38:06.451 --> 38:08.112
Now, you better find a way to help me right now!

38:08.119 --> 38:11.031
- I can suggest another option.
- Suggest it fast.

38:11.039 --> 38:12.870
When our customers apply for a credit card,

38:12.874 --> 38:15.365
the hard copies go to
our storage facility in Queens.

38:15.376 --> 38:19.210
All you need is the account number,
which you already have,

38:19.214 --> 38:20.545
and you can find her application.

38:20.548 --> 38:23.460
However, you need an employee to get you in.

38:23.468 --> 38:26.551
You need an employee...

38:26.554 --> 38:28.215
to get you In.

38:33.645 --> 38:34.930
Crocodile.

38:50.829 --> 38:52.035
Hal.

38:55.917 --> 38:57.532
- Halley.

39:01.923 --> 39:03.083
- Ah.

39:44.424 --> 39:46.289
A natural.

39:46.301 --> 39:48.417
- Yeah?
- Yeah. Really natural.

39:55.393 --> 39:57.429
- No, no, no. Cut, cut, cut.
- What's the problem?

39:57.437 --> 40:02.056
The problem is you can't fend off an army
of bloodthirsty Vikings with a shehnai.

40:02.066 --> 40:04.057
- It's illogical.
- No, see... no, no.

40:04.068 --> 40:07.026
See, you're lulling them into submission
with the music.

40:07.030 --> 40:10.488
That's the whole point of the song, really.
Mystic Surrender.

40:12.243 --> 40:15.030
You don't think he looks like
he hates the music?

40:15.038 --> 40:18.405
No. Hey.

40:21.753 --> 40:23.493
Hey, baby.

40:23.504 --> 40:26.462
Now, this guy, he's-he's like
Alec Guinness. So good.

40:26.466 --> 40:29.173
<i>Star Wars.</i>
Obi-wan.

40:31.304 --> 40:33.590
All right, right here, what are they doing?
What's their attitude?

40:33.598 --> 40:35.304
What are they thinking?
Who are these people?

40:35.308 --> 40:37.515
I tell you, they're in awe
and they're speechless.

40:37.518 --> 40:41.852
And they're just grateful and underfed.
Underpaid.

40:41.856 --> 40:44.472
Why don't they ask me
to stay in the village and have a feast?

40:44.484 --> 40:47.442
- Yeah. Sara, hey.
- Hey.

40:47.445 --> 40:49.936
- Can we talk for a sec?
- Sure.

40:49.948 --> 40:51.939
Okay, yeah, I'm going to split, guys.

40:51.950 --> 40:54.282
Lars, I'll tell you what.
I'm gonna talk to the director,

40:54.285 --> 40:57.448
and I'm gonna have him tweak that whole section.

40:57.455 --> 41:00.538
- It'll be fine. It'll be fine.
- Tell him about the feast.

41:02.794 --> 41:06.286
- What's going on?
- I lost my keys yesterday.

41:06.297 --> 41:07.662
Oh, that's a drag.

41:07.674 --> 41:10.006
And I've just found them in the freezer.

41:10.009 --> 41:12.375
I don't get it. Is that a joke?

41:12.387 --> 41:16.721
No, Lars, it's not a joke.
I feel like I'm losing my mind.

41:16.724 --> 41:20.888
It's the wedding plans
and the tour and my patients.

41:20.895 --> 41:22.476
It's just a bit too much to deal with.

41:22.480 --> 41:26.644
Okay, Sara, look. We're leaving
for Toronto in the morning...

41:26.651 --> 41:28.937
- ...so don't fall apart on me now.
- I know, I know, I know, I know.

41:29.237 --> 41:31.569
And that's why I think I need a little break.

41:32.740 --> 41:34.105
What do you mean, a little break?

41:34.117 --> 41:35.903
No, not that kind of little break.

41:35.910 --> 41:39.994
I just mean a weekend away
to recharge my batteries and clear my head.

41:39.998 --> 41:43.411
Hey, this has nothing to do
with the other night.

41:43.418 --> 41:47.002
I just need this.
I need it for me.

41:47.005 --> 41:49.291
But I won't go unless you say It's okay.

41:51.342 --> 41:53.799
- It's okay.
- Thank you.

41:53.803 --> 41:57.671
Okay. Where are you going?
Where are you going?

41:59.100 --> 42:01.933
Oh, I don't know.
New York, maybe.

42:07.942 --> 42:11.685
- Happy birthday.
- Oh, my God.

42:11.696 --> 42:15.359
Are you serious?
Get out of town.

42:15.366 --> 42:17.106
Yeah, that's the idea.

42:17.118 --> 42:19.530
- Thanks. Talk to you soon.
- Okay.

42:19.537 --> 42:22.244
This is unbelievable. Oh, my God.

42:22.248 --> 42:24.785
Sara, really, this is way too generous of you.

42:24.792 --> 42:28.410
Oh, come on. Can't a girl do something nice
for her friend on her birthday?

42:28.421 --> 42:30.377
And there's no ulterior motives?

42:31.549 --> 42:34.131
Well, yeah.

42:34.135 --> 42:35.500
I'm getting married in a week

42:35.595 --> 42:37.961
and I'd just like to have one last fling
with my best friend

42:37.972 --> 42:39.257
before I walk down the aisle.

42:39.265 --> 42:41.256
It's so sweet. But, you know,
you're really not my type.

42:41.267 --> 42:43.098
- Oh, thanks.

42:43.102 --> 42:46.185
- We're going to New York?
- Yeah. Yay!

- Because you're freaking me out, all right?

43:34.946 --> 43:37.858
- Is there another space you can be in?
- Oh. <i>Excusez-moi.</i>

43:37.865 --> 43:40.447
- Uh-huh.
- And what is it you do?

43:40.451 --> 43:43.614
Well, my sales clerk friend,
I happen to write for a little publication.

43:43.621 --> 43:46.533
Maybe you've heard of it.
It's called the <i>New York Times.</i>

43:46.541 --> 43:47.576
- Oh.
- Yeah.

43:56.676 --> 43:59.634
Hello. Who?

43:59.637 --> 44:03.550
Dean?
And who may I say is calling?

44:03.558 --> 44:06.721
Uh-huh? Hang on.
Your editor.

44:06.727 --> 44:09.639
Hi. No.

44:09.647 --> 44:12.935
Didn't get... Didn't get a chance
to write that one. Uh...

44:13.067 --> 44:15.809
Didn't... Didn't write that one either.

44:15.820 --> 44:19.438
Uh, with all due respect, sir,
they'll all still be dead tomorrow.

44:20.449 --> 44:23.236
Okay. Thank you.
Bye-bye.

44:24.996 --> 44:27.988
- You write for the obituaries.
- Absolutely. Yeah.

44:27.999 --> 44:30.581
- Hmm. You must be very proud.
- Uh-huh. I'm the one with the last word.

44:30.585 --> 44:31.700
- Not tonight.
- Yes, I am.

44:31.711 --> 44:32.871
- I don't think so.
- Absolutely.

44:32.879 --> 44:34.085
- Fat chance.
- Still talking.

44:34.088 --> 44:35.544
- Last line.
- Yeah, right here.

44:38.885 --> 44:40.841
I don't know. I don't know.
My eyes are killing me.

44:40.845 --> 44:42.506
My eyes are killing me.
Tell me these numbers match.

44:42.513 --> 44:43.593
Here, I'll tell you.

44:43.598 --> 44:45.008
- Let me see.
- Don't do that.

44:45.016 --> 44:47.723
- Ah-ah!
- Is it 0293?

44:47.727 --> 44:50.764
- 0293. Congratulations.
- You got it?

44:50.771 --> 44:52.181
- I think you found her.
- No way.

44:52.190 --> 44:54.772
Too bad the last name's
completely smudged out, though.

44:57.195 --> 44:59.186
Well, it's his fault.
It was his thumb.

44:59.197 --> 45:01.654
When he grabbed it,
his thumb went right across the...

45:01.657 --> 45:02.692
right across the name.

45:02.700 --> 45:04.861
Completely. I'm kidding.
It was smudged in my hand.

45:04.869 --> 45:05.984
- Would you stop it?
- It's just a little joke.

45:05.995 --> 45:07.451
That's carbon paper for you.

45:07.455 --> 45:09.867
I guess that's why America rejected it.

45:09.874 --> 45:12.115
What's that address?
Is that her address?

45:12.126 --> 45:13.787
That's seven years ago, man.

45:13.794 --> 45:15.625
So go to the building leasing office

45:15.630 --> 45:17.712
and you'll find out who lived there
seven years ago.

45:17.715 --> 45:18.830
It ain't rocket science.

45:20.551 --> 45:21.666
Thank you.

45:27.141 --> 45:29.678
The white zone is for the immediate loading

45:29.685 --> 45:32.552
and unloading of passengers only.
No parking.

45:32.563 --> 45:34.474
- Hi.
- Hey.

45:34.482 --> 45:36.723
- Where to?
- Yeah, where are we going?

45:36.734 --> 45:39.976
Uh, okay, take us...

45:39.987 --> 45:42.069
- ...anywhere in New York.
- Excuse me?

45:42.073 --> 45:44.155
Anywhere.
Wherever you feel like going.

45:44.158 --> 45:46.649
- That's not a destination, lady.
- Wait. You didn't make reservations?

45:46.661 --> 45:50.245
- Um, okay, Eve, please don't get mad at me.
- What?

45:50.248 --> 45:52.955
Oh, no. I cannot believe this.

45:52.959 --> 45:54.369
I need a borough here, ladies.

45:54.377 --> 45:56.743
Look, I was gonna tell you
when we got on the plane.

45:56.754 --> 45:59.040
You know what?
That's really sneaky of you, Sara.

45:59.048 --> 46:03.587
- I'm not a bloody psychic.
- Eve, wait! Wait!

46:03.594 --> 46:05.084
Hold on one second.

46:05.096 --> 46:08.054
- Eve. Eve!
- You tricked me.

46:08.057 --> 46:09.388
I knew you wouldn't come
if I told you the truth.

46:09.392 --> 46:11.007
And I needed my best friend with me.

46:11.018 --> 46:12.599
What are you doing, Sara?

46:12.603 --> 46:16.687
Honestly, Sara, I don't understand
you anymore, okay?

46:18.317 --> 46:20.182
Please, tell me something.
Tell me anything that makes

46:20.194 --> 46:21.730
just a little bit of sense.

46:24.532 --> 46:30.027
I've just spent the entire flight
staring into the sky, thinking.

46:30.037 --> 46:34.201
Not about my fiancé,
but about this mystery guy I met

46:34.208 --> 46:36.290
a million and a half hours ago.

46:37.128 --> 46:39.961
A guy I don't even remember, except for this...

46:39.964 --> 46:42.831
vague picture I have inside my head.

46:44.051 --> 46:47.543
It was just a few seconds.
A fragment, really.

46:47.555 --> 46:50.217
And it was like...

46:50.224 --> 46:55.935
in that moment, the whole universe existed
just to bring us together.

46:57.481 --> 46:59.813
That's why I'm here.

46:59.817 --> 47:03.730
That's why I'm gonna let fate
take me wherever it wants to go.

47:03.738 --> 47:05.228
Because when all this is over,

47:05.239 --> 47:08.481
at least I'm never gonna have
to think of him ever again.

47:10.161 --> 47:11.992
Let's just pray he's a bald fascist

47:11.996 --> 47:14.738
who picks his nose and wipes it
under the car seat.

47:21.672 --> 47:23.162
- Hi.
- Hi.

47:23.174 --> 47:24.755
Could you hold on?

47:39.690 --> 47:41.021
Where ya goin'?

47:41.901 --> 47:45.359
You better be buying me one friggin'
big birthday cake, that's all I gotta say.

47:45.363 --> 47:47.103
Could I get your destination, please?

47:47.114 --> 47:50.197
- The Waldorf, I guess.
- Finally she gets it.

47:52.953 --> 47:56.491
Okay, we are going... that way.

47:56.499 --> 47:58.114
And I'm gonna follow you.

47:58.959 --> 48:02.292
Come on, you can do it yourself.
Just open up the computer and look into it.

48:02.296 --> 48:04.207
I'm not even sure that I can
give you this information.

48:04.215 --> 48:05.455
Yes, you can. Why can't you?

48:05.466 --> 48:08.003
Because I'm just a temp, okay?
I don't know the rules.

48:08.010 --> 48:10.797
Couple of months out of college, you're acting
like you're part of the establishment.

48:10.805 --> 48:14.343
No, no, no, no, no...
What about privacy law, huh?

48:14.350 --> 48:16.841
Forget about privacy laws.
You know what privacy laws do?

48:16.852 --> 48:18.592
- No.
- They protect millionaires.

48:18.604 --> 48:19.719
Do you know who those millionaires are?

48:19.730 --> 48:21.721
- Who?
- Tell him who they are.

48:21.732 --> 48:23.723
- Tell him.
- Kids your age.

48:23.734 --> 48:27.318
Pimple-faced college dropouts
who have made unhealthy sums of money

48:27.321 --> 48:30.313
forming Internet companies
that create no concrete products,

48:30.324 --> 48:33.157
provide no viable services
and still manage to generate profits

48:33.160 --> 48:35.993
for all of its lazy, day-trading,
son-of-a-bitch shareholders.

48:35.996 --> 48:39.329
Meanwhile, as a tortured member
of the disenfranchised proletariat,

48:39.333 --> 48:43.167
you tind some altruistic need

Ooh! Prada!

49:48.068 --> 49:51.981
Ooh, I love this stuff.

49:51.989 --> 49:54.321
- That's $20.
- 20 bucks?

49:54.325 --> 49:56.816
Eve, that's a horrific knockoff.

49:56.827 --> 50:00.319
At least my fake says Prada.
Yours says Prado.

Yeah? Well, I say for a dollar,
I can buy a little magic marker and fix that.

50:04.251 --> 50:06.663
I'll take it. 20 bucks?

50:06.670 --> 50:09.412
Right back here.
Here you go.

50:09.423 --> 50:12.415
Two buckets of balls for the price of one
at the Chelsea Piers today.

50:12.426 --> 50:14.166
- So where are we going to now?
- I don't know.

50:14.178 --> 50:16.089
- Lady, lady, you're a golfer?
- I feel like... I feel something.

50:16.096 --> 50:17.961
- Wanna play golf? Two for the price of one.
- Right where I'm standing.

50:17.973 --> 50:19.929
Hey! Who are you?

50:19.934 --> 50:24.143
Can you believe that?
Two bucket of... Whoa!

50:25.314 --> 50:28.272
Will you help me up, ma'am?
Yeah, yeah, help me up.

50:28.275 --> 50:31.267
- Oh, my God. Are you okay?
- Is the ball okay?

50:31.278 --> 50:33.109
Yeah, the back of the head.
Is that all right?

50:33.113 --> 50:36.105
Oh, my. Goodness gracious.

50:36.116 --> 50:37.526
I'm all right. Thank you.
Can you get the flyers?

50:37.535 --> 50:39.446
- Here you go.
- All right.

50:41.163 --> 50:42.699
- It's a signal.
- Two buckets of balls.

50:44.124 --> 50:46.080
- Taxi!
- Sara!

50:47.294 --> 50:49.034
They should make pills for this.

51:01.225 --> 51:02.886
He's gotta be here.

51:02.893 --> 51:04.804
He's got to be here. I can feel it.

51:25.249 --> 51:27.240
- Excuse me. Miss?
- Yeah?

51:27.251 --> 51:30.914
- You're blocking my shot.
- Oh.

51:32.464 --> 51:34.250
Oh. Sorry.

51:40.389 --> 51:44.507
This is Nick Roberts, ESPN News, New York City.

51:45.769 --> 51:48.306
- Oh!
- Do you know who plays golf?

51:48.314 --> 51:51.431
Guys who are too fat to play tennis.

51:51.442 --> 51:53.603
Like that guy.

51:53.611 --> 51:55.522
Well, this is a special occasion.

51:55.529 --> 51:58.612
After all, how many times in your life
is your son gonna get married?

51:58.616 --> 52:00.197
Well said.

52:00.200 --> 52:02.441
You wanna know why I love this game?

52:02.453 --> 52:04.159
- No. Why?
- I'll tell ya.

52:04.788 --> 52:08.827
You can take years off from playing
and still come back strong.

52:09.627 --> 52:11.618
Well, me, I haven't played in over five years.

52:11.629 --> 52:12.709
You're kidding.

52:16.050 --> 52:18.041
- Ow!
- Ooh!

52:18.052 --> 52:19.167
- Are you all right?
- I'm okay.

52:19.178 --> 52:20.213
Sorry up there.

52:20.220 --> 52:22.176
- Eve, look out!
- Go.

52:22.181 --> 52:24.843
- Oh!
- Oh, my God, I'm so sorry.

52:24.850 --> 52:26.966
I'm, so sorr...
Are you okay?

52:26.977 --> 52:29.218
Please say something.
Say something.

52:29.229 --> 52:31.436
I think I swallowed a filling.

52:31.440 --> 52:33.305
Thank you for letting us in.

52:33.317 --> 52:37.060
Now, Mr. Mignon, we have an odd
and somewhat personal question to ask you.

52:37.071 --> 52:38.561
Mignon.

52:40.157 --> 52:41.818
Mr. Mignon.

52:41.825 --> 52:43.816
Mignon. Like the meat.

52:44.995 --> 52:48.908
Mr. Mignon, a few years ago,
did you live with a girl, first name Sara?

52:48.916 --> 52:51.498
Attractive, dark hair,
kind of, like, mysterious,

52:51.502 --> 52:53.584
you know, really amazing girl.

52:53.587 --> 52:54.747
<i>Oui.</i>

52:54.755 --> 52:56.620
Do you know where we can locate this individual?

52:57.341 --> 52:58.672
No, I do not.

52:58.676 --> 53:01.418
- Do you remember her last name?
- No.

53:01.428 --> 53:03.544
Oh, come on. You don't even remember
the last name of your ex-girlfriend?

53:03.555 --> 53:04.886
I mean, I find that hard to believe.

53:04.890 --> 53:06.676
You don't understand anything.

53:06.684 --> 53:09.972
She was not my girlfriend.
She was just, uh, a roommate.

53:09.978 --> 53:12.014
She stayed with me
for a very short period of time.

53:12.022 --> 53:15.014
- She was placed with me by...
- A roommate finder's service?

53:15.025 --> 53:18.768
<i>Oui, oui, oui.</i> She stayed with me
with her boyfriend for a few months...

53:18.779 --> 53:22.863
- I don't care about him.
- And then he moved out very quickly.

53:22.866 --> 53:25.528
And at the end of the year,
she moved out too. That's it.

53:25.536 --> 53:27.697
Yeah, but did she leave anything behind,

53:27.705 --> 53:30.287
maybe with her last name on it,
like a receipt, a bill?

53:30.290 --> 53:32.622
- Like a piece of luggage?
- No. No, no.

53:32.626 --> 53:34.491
Anything would help, really.
Anything.

53:36.130 --> 53:37.916
I remember she sat on me.

53:40.217 --> 53:42.674
She... She sat on you?

53:42.678 --> 53:46.637
Yes. She sat on me for a while.

53:48.016 --> 53:49.506
I found her...

53:49.518 --> 53:51.474
inspiring.

53:52.312 --> 53:55.804
I guess this is why I started
painting her in the first place.

53:55.816 --> 53:58.398
Oh. She sat for you.
I'm sorry.

53:59.403 --> 54:01.189
That is what I said.

54:01.196 --> 54:03.107
- That's what he said.
- Right.

54:03.115 --> 54:04.571
- That's what I said.
- Clearly.

54:09.997 --> 54:11.328
Do you happen to have the painting?

54:17.421 --> 54:19.537
Hey, now you're gonna see what it's all about.

54:19.548 --> 54:20.833
You know, you see her face.

54:21.091 --> 54:23.252
Okay. Yeah.

54:24.928 --> 54:26.839
This is her, yes?

54:30.934 --> 54:32.765
Yeah, sure.
Around the eyes a little.

54:32.770 --> 54:33.885
I mean, I'm definitely getting
the British thing,

54:33.896 --> 54:36.012
you know, with the crown and the scepter.

54:36.607 --> 54:38.438
Do you have a name
for the roommate finder's service?

54:38.442 --> 54:39.773
- They would have the information.
- Absolutely.

54:39.777 --> 54:43.235
- Yes. You have that name?
- No, I do not.

54:43.322 --> 54:48.191
But if it helps, I do remember
where the service was located.

54:48.202 --> 54:49.908
- Absolutely!
- Yes! Where? Where?

54:51.288 --> 54:55.247
- Manhattan.
- Where in Manhattan, Mr. Mignon?

54:55.250 --> 54:56.535
On 60th Street.

54:56.543 --> 55:01.037
- Eastside or Westside?
- It was just next to that...

55:01.048 --> 55:05.382
on the left of that splendid little patisserie,

55:05.385 --> 55:06.921
Serendipity.

55:09.306 --> 55:10.466
That's it.

55:15.729 --> 55:18.266
Get... Get ready.

55:19.983 --> 55:22.474
Happy birthday.
It's on the house.

55:22.486 --> 55:23.726
Thank you.

55:24.780 --> 55:28.022
Thanks.

55:28.492 --> 55:30.323
Oh, I'm a god-awful friend.

55:30.327 --> 55:33.160
- No, you will be if you sing.

55:35.999 --> 55:38.160
Eve, thanks so much for coming with me.

55:38.168 --> 55:39.578
You're welcome.

55:41.338 --> 55:43.454
Sara, you know, it's a wonderful thought.

55:44.299 --> 55:46.005
The idea that all of life,

55:46.009 --> 55:48.341
that every single event
is all part of some master plan

55:48.345 --> 55:51.087
designed to lead us to our universal soul mate.

55:51.098 --> 55:54.841
But if that's really true,
then what's the point of living?

55:54.852 --> 55:57.184
Or making decisions?

55:57.187 --> 55:59.098
Hell, why should we even get out of bed
in the morning?

55:59.857 --> 56:00.972
For the cake?

56:00.983 --> 56:04.146
No. Not for the cake.

56:04.152 --> 56:06.268
So that you make mistakes.

56:07.406 --> 56:09.192
Mistakes like this trip.

56:09.199 --> 56:12.362
And if you're smart enough,
you learn from your mistakes.

56:12.369 --> 56:14.701
You figure it out.
You... You think.

56:14.705 --> 56:18.118
You... You realize that life isn't
some elaborate stage play

56:18.125 --> 56:21.288
with directions for the actors.
Life's a mess, Sara.

56:21.295 --> 56:24.458
It's... It's chaos personified.

56:26.967 --> 56:29.629
I have to give it all up now, don't I?

56:29.636 --> 56:35.723
Sara, you have a fiancé
who, despite his weird Eastern music,

56:35.726 --> 56:39.719
which we hope is just a phase, let's hope,

56:39.730 --> 56:42.062
loves you very, very, very much.

56:42.065 --> 56:44.056
It's not giving up. It's growing up.

56:50.824 --> 56:52.815
Let's get out of here.

56:53.744 --> 56:54.733
Yeah.

57:11.595 --> 57:13.426
- Here's one.
- Ooh, catch it.

57:22.856 --> 57:26.269
- It's a bridal shop.
- Oh, my God. The irony.

57:26.276 --> 57:28.437
Wait right here. I'll be right back.

57:28.445 --> 57:29.855
- Why?
- Stay here.

57:34.034 --> 57:35.990
- Time, please?
- Uh, about 7:30.

57:35.994 --> 57:37.325
Right. Right.

57:48.215 --> 57:50.627
They moved downtown. If we get lucky
with traffic, we can still hit it.

57:50.634 --> 57:52.374
- What time is rehearsal?
- Can't do it.

57:52.386 --> 57:54.297
- Taxi!
- It's over, man.

57:55.555 --> 57:56.761
What?

57:56.765 --> 57:58.221
- What are you talking about?
- How can I ignore that?

57:58.225 --> 57:59.635
"Bless the goddamn bride"?

57:59.643 --> 58:01.725
- What?
- It can't get any more clearer than this.

58:01.728 --> 58:04.515
I'm not supposed to be doing this.
It's not in the cards.

58:04.523 --> 58:07.060
It's just...
Hey, it's another one of your clues, man.

58:07.067 --> 58:08.807
Let's talk about it in the cab
on the way over. Let's go.

58:08.819 --> 58:11.561
It's not a clue. It's a sign.

58:11.571 --> 58:12.686
Well, what's the difference?

58:12.698 --> 58:15.735
A clue is what a detective uses
to find a suspect.

58:15.742 --> 58:17.482
The receipt, the warehouse, that French guy...

58:17.494 --> 58:19.155
- Uh-huh.
- Those are clues. This is a sign.

58:19.162 --> 58:21.323
Me never finding the book, that's a sign.

58:21.331 --> 58:23.663
Sara never finding the $5.00 bill,
that's a sign.

58:23.667 --> 58:26.079
How could something not happening be a sign?

58:26.753 --> 58:29.119
Maybe the absence of signs is a sign.

58:30.424 --> 58:31.459
Isn't it?

58:32.300 --> 58:33.255
That's lucid.

58:33.260 --> 58:35.251
Look, I don't know, man.
Maybe there is no fate.

58:35.262 --> 58:37.924
And if there is, it's not working for me.

58:39.766 --> 58:42.553
You know, it's not actually supposed
to end this way, by the way.

58:42.561 --> 58:45.268
We're supposed to pull the curtain
and see the wizard, all right?

58:45.272 --> 58:47.638
- Get to the end of the river.
- This is the end of the river.

58:47.649 --> 58:49.685
My wedding rehearsal starts
in less than an hour.

58:49.693 --> 58:51.354
My bride is waiting for me.

58:51.361 --> 58:52.942
Let me... Let me ask you
something here, okay?

58:52.946 --> 58:55.278
If Sara were here right now, poof, came down,

58:55.282 --> 58:56.772
what would she tell you to do?

58:56.783 --> 58:58.865
She would tell me to run,
not walk to the Waldorf

58:58.869 --> 59:00.359
because all the signs point to me
getting married.

59:00.370 --> 59:02.952
Look. Wedding dress.
Lots of white.

59:02.956 --> 59:04.571
Okay, I hate to state the obvious...

59:04.583 --> 59:05.538
- State it.
- Okay.

59:06.501 --> 59:10.085
If you don't do this,
you may never find out who Sara is.

59:10.756 --> 59:12.542
Maybe I was never supposed to.

59:13.717 --> 59:15.332
Maybe all this is just a maze

59:15.343 --> 59:18.835
designed to lead me directly back
to where I started.

59:21.808 --> 59:23.469
Which Is getting married.

59:28.440 --> 59:30.101
They should make pills for this.

59:34.738 --> 59:37.775
- Halley?
- Oh, my God. Eve!

59:37.783 --> 59:41.651
What a crazy coincidence!
How are you?

59:41.661 --> 59:43.071
- Good.
- Oh, my God.

59:43.080 --> 59:47.449
Sara, can you believe
that I was Halley's R.A. in college?

59:47.459 --> 59:50.667
Isn't that funny?
Oh, I'm sorry. This is Sara.

59:50.670 --> 59:52.831
- Hi. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you too.

59:52.839 --> 59:55.751
Oh, my gosh. What's it been,
like eight or nine years or something.

59:55.759 --> 59:57.715
Eve was, uh...
I went to B.U. with Eve.

59:57.719 --> 01:00:00.927
- Well, isn't that wonderful?
- Yeah. How about that?

01:00:00.931 --> 01:00:02.137
So what are you doing here?

01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:04.677
- I'm getting married tomorrow.
- You are?

01:00:04.684 --> 01:00:06.470
- Yeah.
- Congratulations.

01:00:06.478 --> 01:00:08.059
- Congratulations.
- Wow!

01:00:08.063 --> 01:00:10.770
- Thanks.
- In this hotel?

01:00:10.774 --> 01:00:12.935
Yeah, at 12 noon.
We're actually going to rehearsal.

01:00:12.943 --> 01:00:16.527
- Why don't you come watch?
- Why don't you go?

01:00:16.696 --> 01:00:18.277
Okay, sure. I would love
to come and watch.

01:00:18.281 --> 01:00:22.695
And you can bring your...
partner if you want.

01:00:22.702 --> 01:00:26.286
- Oh!
- Oh! No, no.

01:00:26.289 --> 01:00:28.826
I have to go upstairs and call my fiancé...

01:00:29.251 --> 01:00:33.210
- ...who's a man.
- Oh! You must be very proud.

01:00:33.213 --> 01:00:36.171
- Okay, so have a good one.
- Okay.

01:00:36.174 --> 01:00:37.584
- I'll see you later.
- Okay, good. Okay, bye.

01:00:37.801 --> 01:00:41.464
Good-bye, my sweet lesbian lady lover.

01:00:41.471 --> 01:00:43.883
I'm just kidding.
It's a joke between us.

01:00:56.403 --> 01:00:57.643
Lars?

01:00:59.739 --> 01:01:01.604
What are you doing?

01:01:01.616 --> 01:01:04.153
How did you know where I was?

01:01:04.161 --> 01:01:07.244
- Intuition.
- Really?

01:01:08.165 --> 01:01:11.407
No. I went through
the New York hotel guide.

01:01:11.418 --> 01:01:14.581
Alphabetically, in reverse.
I started with "Z."

01:01:14.588 --> 01:01:17.045
Sara, I missed you so much.

01:01:18.842 --> 01:01:21.504
I'm sorry. I don't blame you
for running away.

01:01:22.095 --> 01:01:27.010
I was so... focused
on the album, the video.

01:01:29.519 --> 01:01:32.807
I, Jonathan, take you, Halley, to be my wife,

01:01:32.814 --> 01:01:34.600
and I promise to love and sustain you

01:01:34.608 --> 01:01:37.645
in the bonds of marriage from this day forward.

01:01:57.881 --> 01:02:00.372
And obviously, Jonathan,
you'll be looking at Halley.

01:02:01.468 --> 01:02:04.460
And that's when the actual ceremony
will conclude.

01:02:04.471 --> 01:02:05.677
- Excuse me.
- What?

01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:06.886
Well, look, I need some help over here.

01:02:06.890 --> 01:02:09.882
And then... then you're married.

01:02:09.893 --> 01:02:12.384
- Hal, who's that girl over there?
- Huh?

01:02:12.395 --> 01:02:15.558
- Oh, that's my old friend Eve.
- Oh.

01:02:15.565 --> 01:02:17.430
Okay, everyone, that's a wrap.

01:02:17.442 --> 01:02:19.728
And now make sure to be here tomorrow morning

01:02:19.736 --> 01:02:21.146
at 9:00 sharp for pictures.

01:02:21.154 --> 01:02:23.486
Yes, yes. I hate to break up a good thing,

01:02:23.490 --> 01:02:25.481
but we have half a dozen strippers
waiting for us. We're late.

01:02:25.492 --> 01:02:27.653
- You mean "exotic dancers."
- No, no. I actually mean "strippers,"

01:02:27.661 --> 01:02:30.573
- the women who take off everything.
- Listen, I'll see you men at 9:00.

01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:33.071
But remember, I promised Judy
I'd be home by 10:00.

01:02:33.083 --> 01:02:35.039
Fantastic, Mr. McKinley.
It gives you an hour to get crazy.

01:02:35.043 --> 01:02:37.159
- Okay, let's get into it.
- Hello, darling.

01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:40.754
Uh, Dean, before you take Jon and Dad off
to your male-bonding ritual,

01:02:40.757 --> 01:02:42.088
I need to talk to him.

01:02:42.592 --> 01:02:45.174
Okay. Beautiful bride.
I'll be in the cab.

01:02:46.513 --> 01:02:50.802
- Hi. I want you to meet Jon.
- Hi. It's so nice to meet you.

01:02:51.184 --> 01:02:52.720
I would love for you to come tomorrow.

01:02:52.727 --> 01:02:56.436
- We'd feel terrible if you didn't.
- Really?

01:02:56.439 --> 01:02:57.929
- Yeah.
- That's so sweet.

01:02:57.941 --> 01:02:59.351
And it's tomorrow at noon?

01:02:59.359 --> 01:03:01.190
Yeah, and you can bring your friend if you want.

01:03:01.194 --> 01:03:02.775
- Okay.
- Be there.

01:03:02.779 --> 01:03:03.734
Wow. I'll be there.

01:03:04.447 --> 01:03:07.109
Thank you. That's so nice.

01:03:07.117 --> 01:03:08.778
- See you tomorrow.
- See you tomorrow. Nice to meet you.

01:03:08.785 --> 01:03:10.696
Okay, bye. Bye. See you.

01:03:14.207 --> 01:03:17.119
- Halley, what is it? What's wrong?
- It's you.

01:03:17.127 --> 01:03:18.788
What do you mean, it's me?
What did I do?

01:03:18.795 --> 01:03:21.753
Nothing, exactly.
It's just this feeling I have, like...

01:03:22.757 --> 01:03:25.123
like you've been somewhere else
for the past few days.

01:03:25.135 --> 01:03:28.002
- That's not true.
- Don't lie to me, Jonathan.

01:03:30.473 --> 01:03:34.386
I've dreamed about this
my entire life, and... and...

01:03:34.394 --> 01:03:37.227
I've imagined the dress and the flowers

01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:40.063
and even the music the band was gonna play.

01:03:40.066 --> 01:03:43.354
And everything is exactly the way I want it,

01:03:43.361 --> 01:03:44.476
except for my fiancé,

01:03:44.487 --> 01:03:46.819
who's just decided to float off
to Never-Never Land.

01:03:46.823 --> 01:03:49.235
Look, maybe I've been
a little bit out of it the past week,

01:03:49.242 --> 01:03:51.483
but it's just normal, you know, guy stuff.

01:03:51.494 --> 01:03:53.155
It's a little cold feet.
Doesn't mean I don't love you.

01:03:53.163 --> 01:03:55.996
Well, call me crazy, but I'd like
my fiancé's feet to be warm,

01:03:55.999 --> 01:03:59.162
especially when we're hours
from going down the aisle.

01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:03.996
I'm sorry, Hal. Really, I am.

01:04:05.091 --> 01:04:10.882
Whatever it is that you're holding on to,
please just let it go.

01:04:12.515 --> 01:04:13.675
Please.

01:04:14.851 --> 01:04:17.342
I think it already let go of me, okay?

01:04:21.649 --> 01:04:23.185
Wait. Wait one second.

01:04:26.446 --> 01:04:28.437
- What's this?
- What do you think?

01:04:28.448 --> 01:04:31.281
It's the traditional groom's gift.

01:04:31.284 --> 01:04:33.866
I got yours, and I forgot to bring it.

01:04:33.870 --> 01:04:35.906
I know. It's okay.

01:04:35.914 --> 01:04:37.120
Open it.

01:04:43.880 --> 01:04:45.711
It's a first edition.

01:04:47.217 --> 01:04:49.299
It's just that every time
we go into a bookstore,

01:04:49.302 --> 01:04:51.213
you're always flipping through it.

01:04:51.221 --> 01:04:53.803
And I checked this week.
You don't even have a copy.

01:05:07.737 --> 01:05:09.978
What's wrong?
Don't you like it?

01:05:12.909 --> 01:05:14.399
It's perfect.

01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:17.326

to rain on your parade, man.

He said, "If you want to improve,

01:09:16.109 --> 01:09:18.977
be content to be thought
foolish and stupid."

01:09:18.988 --> 01:09:20.444

On second thought, maybe you should call first.

01:10:22.218 --> 01:10:24.300
- What are you talking about?
- Give her a ring. It's more polite that way.

01:10:24.303 --> 01:10:26.669
Calling her gives her a chance
to clean up, you know.

01:10:26.681 --> 01:10:28.467
I don't care how clean her house Is!

01:10:28.474 --> 01:10:30.465

- What are you talking about?

01:10:30.476 --> 01:10:32.512
- You told me to go! You said I was your hero!
- I forbid you to look.

01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:34.226

- I won't get hurt.

01:10:38.901 --> 01:10:40.812
- Listen, don't get hurt!
- You're hurting me! Oof!

01:11:19.275 --> 01:11:22.312
- I think that went very well.

01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:25.858
Didn't... Didn't she say that everything
happens for a reason?

01:11:25.865 --> 01:11:29.073
- Yeah, she did.
- Well, maybe we're laying here because...

01:11:29.076 --> 01:11:30.282
Because why?

01:11:31.746 --> 01:11:34.283
Because you don't want to be
standing somewhere else.

01:11:46.969 --> 01:11:48.925
I see. Yeah. We're crawling.

01:11:48.930 --> 01:11:50.136
We're crawling.

01:11:50.848 --> 01:11:52.964
Ladies and gentlemen,
this is the captain speaking.

01:11:52.975 --> 01:11:55.557
I'm sorry to report that we're gonna be
on the ground a little longer

01:11:55.561 --> 01:11:57.552
due to some bad weather heading this way.

01:11:57.563 --> 01:12:00.475
The air traffic controller has put us on hold,
so in the meantime,

01:12:00.483 --> 01:12:02.815
I've asked the cabin attendants
to start the movie.

01:12:04.320 --> 01:12:06.902
- Hey, you getting ready?
- Yeah.

01:12:06.906 --> 01:12:09.147
You know me.
I love a good wedding.

01:12:09.617 --> 01:12:12.529
- So have you talked to Lars?
- Yeah.

01:12:12.537 --> 01:12:15.199
We spoke this morning before he left.

01:12:15.206 --> 01:12:18.994
I think he's gonna be okay.
At least I hope so.

01:12:19.001 --> 01:12:20.241
You know, of course he's gonna be okay,

01:12:20.253 --> 01:12:22.665
and I gotta tell you something,
you're gonna be okay too.

01:12:22.672 --> 01:12:24.208
Yeah?

01:12:25.174 --> 01:12:28.337
Oh, you know what?
Um, there's a lady glaring at me.

01:12:28.344 --> 01:12:30.005
I don't think I'm supposed to be on the phone.

01:12:30.012 --> 01:12:31.593
Um, can I call you when I get home?

01:12:31.597 --> 01:12:33.633
Have a safe flight, okay?

01:12:33.641 --> 01:12:36.804
- Lots of love. Bye.
- Headsets?

01:12:36.811 --> 01:12:39.518
- Yes, I will.
- $3.00, please.

01:12:41.774 --> 01:12:43.059
What the hell is this?

01:12:44.068 --> 01:12:44.932
Something the matter?

01:12:44.944 --> 01:12:49.187
Yes. I think I've mixed up my wallet
with my friend's.

01:12:49.198 --> 01:12:50.688
Yes, I have. See? Prado.

01:12:50.700 --> 01:12:52.156
Oh.

01:12:52.785 --> 01:12:54.275
Well, is there any money in it?

01:12:55.079 --> 01:12:55.943
I'll have a look.

01:12:58.207 --> 01:13:00.698
Yes, there is. Thank you.

01:13:18.227 --> 01:13:22.687

01:13:22.690 --> 01:13:24.976
- Thank you very much, sir.
- Thank you.

01:13:24.984 --> 01:13:28.727
- Uh, sorry. Excuse me.
- That's the gentleman's change.

01:13:28.738 --> 01:13:31.229
- Jonathan.
- Excuse me. I just...

01:13:31.365 --> 01:13:32.229

01:13:32.241 --> 01:13:34.698

- I'm looking for a Jonathan Trager.

01:14:08.653 --> 01:14:09.608
Is this his building?

01:14:09.612 --> 01:14:11.148
You must be late.

01:14:11.155 --> 01:14:12.235
Late for what?

01:14:12.239 --> 01:14:14.400
The wedding.
Waldorf-Astoria.

01:14:17.703 --> 01:14:20.820
- He's getting married?
- Yeah. Might be already.

01:14:22.959 --> 01:14:25.041
Wait! Hey, wait! Wait!

01:14:25.044 --> 01:14:26.409
- Excuse me!

01:14:28.005 --> 01:14:30.371
Sorry. Can you take me
to the Waldorf-Astoria

01:14:30.383 --> 01:14:31.714
as fast as you can go, please?

01:14:36.389 --> 01:14:37.549
Can you see what it is?

01:14:55.908 --> 01:14:57.899
Oh! Sorry. Sorry!

01:15:03.499 --> 01:15:06.332
Oh. Oh, please, God, no.

01:15:10.089 --> 01:15:10.999
Stop!

01:15:12.174 --> 01:15:13.209
Stop?

01:15:13.217 --> 01:15:14.923
Is it over?

01:15:15.720 --> 01:15:16.926
- The wedding?
- Yeah.

01:15:16.929 --> 01:15:19.841
Oh, yeah.
It's over, all right.

01:15:29.233 --> 01:15:30.723
But don't worry.

01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:33.066
You'll get your present back.

01:15:34.613 --> 01:15:38.231
- Excuse me?
- They always return the presents.

01:15:39.702 --> 01:15:41.283
You asked If it was over.

01:15:42.747 --> 01:15:45.113
The truth is, it never even began.

01:15:45.750 --> 01:15:46.910
What?

01:15:46.917 --> 01:15:49.954
Yeah, he called the whole thing off
this morning.

01:15:53.382 --> 01:15:54.918
He called it off?

01:16:04.393 --> 01:16:05.599
That's terrible.

01:16:07.313 --> 01:16:09.269
Were you a friend of the bride...

01:16:12.151 --> 01:16:13.561
or the groom?

01:16:21.577 --> 01:16:24.239
- What's up with this weather, huh?
- Yeah, what happened to spring?

01:16:25.456 --> 01:16:27.071
So, all right, let's get into it.

01:16:27.083 --> 01:16:28.539
What kind of pep talk do you want?

01:16:28.542 --> 01:16:29.531
What do you got?

01:16:30.127 --> 01:16:31.742
Well, I've got the inspirational,

01:16:31.754 --> 01:16:33.745
"You can achieve anything
you dream about."

01:16:33.756 --> 01:16:36.088
It's very popular, but not appropriate for this.

01:16:36.092 --> 01:16:39.584
Of course, there's the "Don't worry.
There's more fish in the sea" pap.

01:16:39.595 --> 01:16:40.584
No.

01:16:41.013 --> 01:16:43.129
Uh, we can always fall back on the classic,

01:16:43.140 --> 01:16:47.008
"When God shuts a door,
he opens a window."

01:16:48.104 --> 01:16:50.311
How about telling me I did the right thing?

01:16:50.856 --> 01:16:52.471
I don't have to tell you.

01:16:54.235 --> 01:16:55.224
I wrote it.

01:16:56.278 --> 01:16:58.189
- What's this?
- It's your obituary.

01:16:58.197 --> 01:16:59.983
Nice.

01:16:59.990 --> 01:17:02.652
Turns out I had writer's block
penning your best man speech,

01:17:02.660 --> 01:17:03.945
and that's what ended up coming out.

01:17:04.537 --> 01:17:06.243
Blame it on the day job.

01:17:08.290 --> 01:17:09.746
- 20, right?
- Thanks.

01:17:13.963 --> 01:17:15.203
You going to see Courtney?

01:17:15.214 --> 01:17:17.250
Absolutely.

01:17:18.425 --> 01:17:21.542
I needed this.

01:17:23.764 --> 01:17:25.880
You know, the Greeks didn't write obituaries.

01:17:27.059 --> 01:17:29.391
They only asked one question after a man died:

01:17:31.397 --> 01:17:33.479
"Did he have passion?"

01:17:37.403 --> 01:17:39.018
How do I look?

01:17:43.909 --> 01:17:45.649
Like a jackass.

01:17:47.663 --> 01:17:49.904
- Good luck, man.
- Thank you.

01:18:03.095 --> 01:18:04.426
Jonathan Trager,

01:18:05.139 --> 01:18:07.721
prominent television producer for ESPN,

01:18:07.725 --> 01:18:13.311
died last night from complications
of losing his soul mate and his fiancée.

01:18:14.523 --> 01:18:16.809
He was 35 years old

01:18:16.817 --> 01:18:18.227
and soft-spoken

01:18:18.235 --> 01:18:19.600
and obsessive.

01:18:19.612 --> 01:18:22.399
Trager never looked the part
of a hopeless romantic.

01:18:22.907 --> 01:18:25.740
But in the final days of his life,

01:18:25.743 --> 01:18:28.655
he revealed an unknown side of his psyche.

01:18:29.121 --> 01:18:32.284
This hidden quasi-Jungian persona

01:18:32.291 --> 01:18:35.249
surfaced during
the Agatha Christie-like pursuit

01:18:35.252 --> 01:18:37.538
for his long-reputed soul mate,

01:18:37.546 --> 01:18:40.879
a woman whom he only spent
a few precious hours with.

01:18:41.550 --> 01:18:45.839
Sadly, the protracted search
ended late Saturday night

01:18:45.846 --> 01:18:49.134
In complete and utter failure.

01:18:49.892 --> 01:18:52.099
Yet even in certain defeat,

01:18:52.353 --> 01:18:54.969
the courageous Trager
secretly clung to the belief

01:18:54.980 --> 01:18:56.186
that life Is not merely

01:18:56.190 --> 01:18:59.023
a series of meaningless
accidents or coincidences.

01:18:59.026 --> 01:19:02.484
Uh-uh. But rather
it's a tapestry of events

01:19:02.488 --> 01:19:06.401
that culminate in an exquisite, sublime plan.

01:19:07.451 --> 01:19:09.658
Asked about the loss of his dear friend,

01:19:09.662 --> 01:19:10.902
Dean Kansky,

01:19:10.913 --> 01:19:12.323
the Pulitzer Prize-winning author

01:19:12.331 --> 01:19:14.071
and executive editor
of the <i>New York Times,</i>

01:19:14.083 --> 01:19:16.540
described Jonathan as a changed man

01:19:16.543 --> 01:19:18.249
in the last days of his life.

01:19:19.213 --> 01:19:21.704
"Things were clearer for him," Kansky noted.

01:19:21.715 --> 01:19:24.673
Ultimately, Jonathan concluded
that if we are to live life

01:19:24.677 --> 01:19:26.008
in harmony with the universe,

01:19:26.011 --> 01:19:28.377
we must all possess a powerful faith

01:19:28.389 --> 01:19:30.425
in what the ancients used to call <i>fatum,</i>

01:19:31.350 --> 01:19:33.261
what we currently refer to...

01:19:34.186 --> 01:19:35.767
- ...as destiny.
- Destiny.

01:19:48.993 --> 01:19:49.857
So what are you gonna do?

01:19:49.868 --> 01:19:52.735
I don't know. I guess I'm just gonna
try and find him or something.

01:19:52.830 --> 01:19:53.945
Oh, you know what?
I don't think you should do that.

01:19:53.956 --> 01:19:54.945
I really don't.

01:19:54.957 --> 01:19:56.743
- Well, what do you think I should do?
- I think you should just be here.

01:19:57.209 --> 01:19:59.575
I feel it. I feel it In the air.

01:19:59.586 --> 01:20:00.826
Eve, what's happened to you?

01:20:00.838 --> 01:20:04.001
You've become your own worst
nightmare right there.

01:20:06.677 --> 01:20:07.632
Bye.

01:20:11.432 --> 01:20:14.890

No beverages on the premises!
