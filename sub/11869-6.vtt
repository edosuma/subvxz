00:01.251 --> 00:02.627
CARTER: It wasjust
a normal day in Eureka.

00:02.753 --> 00:03.742
Day's not over yet.

00:04.296 --> 00:05.877
Yeah. Like that was
going to last.

00:06.006 --> 00:09.544
Hello, 1947.
Confused? Let me clarify.

00:09.676 --> 00:11.086
The five of us got
transported back in time

00:11.220 --> 00:13.632
through some wormhole thingy
thanks to the Bridge Device.

00:13.764 --> 00:15.004
We eventually found
our way back home,

00:15.140 --> 00:17.722
but, surprise, home wasn't
exactly the way we left it.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.637
Henry? Married.

00:19.770 --> 00:20.976
Zane and Jo? Never dated.

00:21.104 --> 00:23.311
But Jo's in charge
of G.D. Security.

00:23.440 --> 00:25.681
Kevin? Different,
much to Allison's surprise.

00:25.817 --> 00:27.682
And Fargo?
Head of Global Dynamics,

00:27.819 --> 00:29.434
much to everyone's surprise.

00:29.571 --> 00:31.983
Oh, and Dr. Old Spice
hitched a ride with us
back to the present,

00:32.115 --> 00:34.322
but there's one crappy rule.

00:34.451 --> 00:35.816
We can't tell anyone.

00:36.578 --> 00:39.194
If people ever found out
about our trip,
there'd be trouble.

00:39.831 --> 00:43.289
And I finally kissed Allison,
63 years ago.

00:43.710 --> 00:46.622
But that's Eureka for you.
Same town, big changes.

00:49.174 --> 00:50.414
CARTER: Go, go, go!
(EXCLAIMS)

00:59.309 --> 01:00.389
Did we lose her?

01:05.190 --> 01:06.396
(CHUCKLES)

01:09.152 --> 01:10.141
Yeah, man.

01:10.862 --> 01:11.851
(TIRES SCREECHING)

01:20.205 --> 01:21.194
(GRUNTS)

01:28.297 --> 01:29.833
Everybody out!
Everybody out!

01:34.845 --> 01:36.085
CARTER: Jesus!

01:37.222 --> 01:38.211
Go! Go!

02:40.327 --> 02:41.316
(SIGHS)

02:41.495 --> 02:42.575
Carter!

02:45.832 --> 02:49.324
| just found this
perverted little toaster
spying on me in the shower.

02:49.461 --> 02:53.170
Ah, that's Kevin's
homework assignment,
actually.

02:53.382 --> 02:54.713
No, not
the spying part.

02:54.841 --> 02:57.674
This is Eureka's version
of carrying an egg around

02:57.803 --> 02:58.918
to show you know
how to parent.

02:59.096 --> 03:00.256
SARAH:
Actually, Sheriff Carter,

03:00.639 --> 03:03.506
the Emo is
a highly sophisticated
emotional attachment robot

03:03.642 --> 03:06.258
designed to develop
a genuine bond
with its caregiver.

03:06.812 --> 03:07.972
I don't care
what it's for.

03:08.105 --> 03:12.098
It's got video of me
showering embedded
in its little Emo brain.

03:12.567 --> 03:14.819
No doubt for Kevin's
viewing pleasure.

03:15.404 --> 03:16.359
Get rid of it.

03:16.488 --> 03:18.820
(CHUCKLING)
Oh, come on.
He's awfully cute.

03:21.201 --> 03:24.819
For an instrument
of wrongdoing.
I'll talk to Allison.

03:28.750 --> 03:29.705
You called, Sheriff?

03:29.835 --> 03:31.826
Uh, no. Talk to Lupo.

03:34.589 --> 03:36.170
How may I be
of service, Miss Lupo?

03:36.425 --> 03:39.167
Like I haven't had
enough of you robots
this morning.

03:39.803 --> 03:40.792
(SIGHS)

03:41.263 --> 03:42.594
What do you mean,
"you robots"?

03:44.182 --> 03:45.718
SARAH:
Good morning, Deputy Andy.

03:45.851 --> 03:48.593
Hey there, SARAH.
I'm a mite puzzled.

03:48.812 --> 03:50.973
l'm positive
I received a call
from this location.

03:51.189 --> 03:52.804
Perhaps
there's a glitch
in your software.

03:53.275 --> 03:56.859
May | link you to the
Global Dynamics mainframe
computer for a diagnostic?

03:57.279 --> 03:58.769
Gee, that'd be
super, SARAH.

04:02.826 --> 04:04.691
Um, that's not it.

04:04.828 --> 04:06.784
Oops. Beg pardon.

04:22.345 --> 04:25.553
lf Kevin sent a robot
to spy on a beautiful girl
in the shower,

04:25.682 --> 04:27.013
I'm guessing
he's curious
about something

04:27.142 --> 04:28.973
he didn't want to discuss
with his mom.

04:29.311 --> 04:32.098
He knows that
he can come to me.
I'm a medical doctor.

04:32.230 --> 04:33.970
No. You're his mom.

04:34.399 --> 04:37.141
But Henry,
Fargo and l are
planning a camping trip.

04:37.527 --> 04:39.438
You think Kevin might
want to tag along?

04:40.781 --> 04:42.942
That sounds
suspiciously
like a reward.

04:43.200 --> 04:45.566
No. ljust think
some guy time
might pave the way

04:45.702 --> 04:48.944
or make it easier
for him to talk
about girl stuff.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.954
(CHUCKLES) Girl stuff?

04:52.125 --> 04:53.114
Yeah.

04:53.960 --> 04:57.293
Come on. I want to help.
I've been through this.
Let me help.

04:59.090 --> 05:01.627
Okay. Thanks, Carter.

05:02.219 --> 05:03.379
You're welcome.

05:04.971 --> 05:06.632
Hey, there,
fellow adventure—seeker!

05:06.765 --> 05:08.346
Ready to test your
mettle against
the great unknown?

05:08.767 --> 05:10.473
This is going to be fun.
I'm going to go pack.

05:10.602 --> 05:11.717
Meet you at the
rendezvous point.

05:11.853 --> 05:12.888
Great.

05:13.522 --> 05:15.729
Now while I'm in country,
you'll be acting Director

05:15.857 --> 05:17.518
with all the perks
and privileges.

05:17.734 --> 05:19.690
I've put together
a detailed brief.

05:19.820 --> 05:23.438
Fargo, this was my job
five minutes ago.
I know what to do.

05:23.698 --> 05:24.778
Right.

05:25.242 --> 05:28.234
If anything pops up,
just ask Larry.
He's here to do your bidding.

05:28.370 --> 05:31.362
Actually, I am working
on some tomographic
imaging research,

05:31.498 --> 05:32.829
and I could use
a volunteer.

05:33.124 --> 05:34.330
Great.
Fargo, have you seen

05:34.459 --> 05:36.666
a little robot
around here,
about yay high?

05:38.713 --> 05:39.702
(SIGHS)

05:57.190 --> 05:58.475
(PEOPLE CHATTERING)

06:05.198 --> 06:08.031
Hey, Henry. We're going
to have an addition
to our camping trip

06:08.159 --> 06:09.410
And a subtraction.
I'm going to...

06:09.536 --> 06:10.491
No.

06:10.620 --> 06:13.578
Yes, yes. I'm going to
stay and help Grace
with a project of hers.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.447
Great.
Well, no, no.

06:15.584 --> 06:16.699
This may be
the strangest thing
I've ever said,

06:16.835 --> 06:20.828
but I am think
I'm falling in love
with my wife.

06:21.298 --> 06:22.538
(BOTH LAUGHING)

06:22.674 --> 06:25.837
That's not even in the top ten
of the strangest things
you've ever said.

06:26.803 --> 06:27.713
And what about you?

06:27.846 --> 06:28.835
What about me?

06:29.139 --> 06:30.379
Well, oh, come on.

06:30.515 --> 06:32.722
I've seen the way
you've been looking
at Allison since we got back.

06:32.851 --> 06:34.933
No, no, no.
You cannot
seriously tell me

06:35.061 --> 06:38.599
you're going to let
Charles Grant sweep her
out from under you.

06:38.732 --> 06:39.721
Of course not.

06:39.858 --> 06:40.722
Then you're gonna...

06:40.859 --> 06:41.939
I'm gonna...

06:43.361 --> 06:44.646
Procrasti nate.

06:44.863 --> 06:46.444
Probably. Yes.
Most likely.

06:46.573 --> 06:47.813
As usual.
Yes. Yes.

06:47.949 --> 06:49.064
What is wrong with you?

06:49.200 --> 06:50.861
l... I got a plan.

06:50.994 --> 06:52.530
What?
It's a long—term plan.

06:52.662 --> 06:53.777
How long?

07:04.549 --> 07:05.538
(THUDDING)

07:05.717 --> 07:06.706
(BLEEPING)

07:11.598 --> 07:15.967
So the idea is
to access my
short—term memory?

07:16.227 --> 07:17.216
Exactly.

07:17.354 --> 07:20.767
The retrieval system
could help people
with Alzheimer's

07:20.899 --> 07:22.014
recover lost memories.

07:22.150 --> 07:25.517
Uh—huh.
So what do l have to do?

07:25.987 --> 07:27.852
Just sit there
looking pretty.

07:27.989 --> 07:29.195
Ah, what I do best.

07:29.366 --> 07:32.483
I am going to program
a feeling.

07:33.286 --> 07:36.619
So let's go with
something fun like elation.

07:36.748 --> 07:37.703
Mmm—hmm.

07:37.832 --> 07:39.697
The Al. system will
access your memories

07:39.834 --> 07:42.371
to find a powerful
association for you.

07:45.840 --> 07:46.829
Hmm.

07:51.638 --> 07:52.844
(LAUGHS)

07:53.848 --> 07:54.837
How'd I do?

08:00.063 --> 08:01.303
(LAUGHS)

08:02.440 --> 08:03.816
That well, huh?

08:04.359 --> 08:06.850
Okay. Okay. Okay.

08:10.532 --> 08:12.488
A few weeks ago

08:12.909 --> 08:17.699
I traveled back in time
and returned to
an alternate reality,

08:17.831 --> 08:20.538
this reality,
to find myself

08:21.960 --> 08:25.418
married to you.

08:27.674 --> 08:28.709
(CHUCKLES)

08:28.842 --> 08:32.460
Okay, Henry, the key
to a good practical joke
lies in its plausibility.

08:32.595 --> 08:33.584
Grace, l'm notjoking.

08:33.722 --> 08:36.509
That machine you've
seen me working on
in the garage

08:36.641 --> 08:39.678
is a re—fabrication
of Einstein's Bridge.

08:39.811 --> 08:41.597
Uh, sloppy premise,
Henry.

08:41.730 --> 08:43.140
The Bridge was based
on impossible theories

08:43.273 --> 08:44.729
that never
amounted to anything.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.723
Yes, they didn't
amount to anything
until last month.

08:46.860 --> 08:51.524
I promise you.
I promise you.
It worked.

08:53.867 --> 08:55.152
You're really
going to keep this up.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.449
Founder's Day,

09:00.582 --> 09:05.167
Jack, Allison, Jo,
Fargo and l

09:05.837 --> 09:08.624
were transported
through a wormhole
back to 1947.

09:09.883 --> 09:13.216
We returned
to a reality

09:13.887 --> 09:17.425
almost identical
to the one we'd left.

09:20.602 --> 09:21.591
Almost.

09:21.728 --> 09:23.844
In the reality
that I knew,

09:25.732 --> 09:28.895
you and I had barely met.

09:31.279 --> 09:33.736
Grace, I'm so sorry.
I wanted to tell you
this...

09:33.865 --> 09:36.777
Henry, just stop. Stop.

09:40.371 --> 09:41.656
Grace...

09:42.082 --> 09:43.071
(GRUNTING)

09:55.845 --> 09:57.130
You sure you're okay?

09:57.597 --> 09:58.586
I've been better.

09:58.723 --> 10:00.008
GRACE: There was
a power surge
in the sensors

10:00.141 --> 10:02.974
but my system's
programmed to put
safety above all else.

10:03.853 --> 10:05.593
There must be a flaw
in the Al. upgrade.

10:06.773 --> 10:09.310
I guess you can't take
anything for granted
around here anymore.

10:11.945 --> 10:12.934
(BEEPING)

10:14.864 --> 10:16.946
Possible security breach
on loading dock "l3."

10:19.160 --> 10:22.402
I'm sure
you two will figure out
what's going on here.

10:24.249 --> 10:25.238
Okay, then.

10:28.545 --> 10:29.830
l'll figure it out
on my own.

10:39.556 --> 10:42.798
MAN: So I'm giving Tiny there
a final inspection before
she ships off to NASA,

10:42.934 --> 10:46.426
and | find an unauthorized
stowaway in one of her
internal containment bins.

10:51.860 --> 10:53.771
You have got to be
kidding me.

10:55.655 --> 10:56.861
Mmm—hmm.

10:58.783 --> 11:03.152
So, any questions?
Andy? Andy?

11:03.830 --> 11:04.740
Hmm?

11:04.873 --> 11:06.488
The list of stuff
| just went through.
Any questions?

11:06.833 --> 11:07.697
One, Sheriff.

11:07.834 --> 11:08.789
When first wooing
a woman,

11:08.918 --> 11:12.410
do you find it best to come
bearing flowers, poetry,
or a small pet of some kind?

11:13.631 --> 11:17.715
On second thought,
if anything related to law
comes up, you just call Jo.

11:17.844 --> 11:19.675
Fantastic idea.
I'll do that.

11:19.804 --> 11:20.714
All right.

11:20.847 --> 11:23.805
Hey, forget something?

11:23.933 --> 11:26.970
You can't keep neglecting
your Emo and expect
to get a good grade.

11:27.312 --> 11:29.303
So I'll lower
my expectations.

11:31.274 --> 11:32.559
Come here.

11:33.359 --> 11:34.735
Mom, really?

11:34.861 --> 11:36.317
Help. Please, help.

11:36.446 --> 11:39.859
Okay. I think it's time
that the men folk
got out of town.

11:42.911 --> 11:43.991
Room for one more?

11:47.081 --> 11:49.163
Allison told me
you're taking Kevin camping.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.658
If there's one or
two things I know,
it's about the great outdoors.

11:51.794 --> 11:54.376
Besides, a weekend away
with the boys
sounds like fun.

11:56.507 --> 11:58.213
That's not really
what I had in mind.

11:59.302 --> 12:00.963
Well, that's a shame.

12:01.429 --> 12:03.135
Well, in that case,
you got any plans
this weekend?

12:03.264 --> 12:05.255
(STUTTERING) Wow.

12:05.391 --> 12:07.097
Look, there seems
to be plenty of room
in Fargo's car.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.842
Why don't you
jump in with him?

12:10.021 --> 12:11.932
All right, you boys,
play nice.

12:13.233 --> 12:14.268
Not likely.

12:14.859 --> 12:15.848
Come on, bud.

12:23.409 --> 12:24.398
(PANTlNG)

12:25.495 --> 12:27.326
Yeah, this is good.
This is perfect.

12:28.456 --> 12:29.445
GRANT: Tired already?

12:29.582 --> 12:32.619
You should try traversing
the Bavarian mountains
in December, sport.

12:32.835 --> 12:33.995
Now, there's a hike.

12:34.128 --> 12:35.743
FARGO: That's great,
but check this out.

12:37.840 --> 12:41.298
Behold.
The latest in G.D.
sporting goods technology.

12:54.232 --> 12:56.564
We call it the Mu—tent,
patent pending.

12:56.693 --> 12:57.853
Care for a tour?

12:58.861 --> 12:59.850
Yeah.

13:04.867 --> 13:06.994
Oh, very compe—tent.

13:08.288 --> 13:09.573
ELECTRONIC VOICE:
Hello, Douglas.

13:09.706 --> 13:12.448
Are you enjoying
your camping experience?

13:13.209 --> 13:14.369
Aces, Buffy.

13:15.169 --> 13:16.249
Buffy?

13:16.379 --> 13:18.836
Biomechanical Un—Folding
Fully—automated Yurt.

13:19.382 --> 13:21.293
I just downloaded
her new A.|. this morning.

13:25.847 --> 13:28.384
Man, I could get used to
camping Dr. Fargo—style.

13:29.475 --> 13:31.261
Kevin, this isn't camping.

13:32.353 --> 13:33.559
I call it glamping.

13:34.647 --> 13:37.730
CARTER: No, no, no.
You're going to
thank me, guys.

13:37.859 --> 13:41.568
We're going to camp

supposed to be camped.

13:48.870 --> 13:51.156
That's a lot of...

13:57.962 --> 14:00.453
All right, Grant,
you're up. What's your...

14:03.092 --> 14:04.343
Never mind. Kevin?

14:04.469 --> 14:07.006
You're gonna have to
give up the game thingy.

14:08.556 --> 14:10.217
(SIGHS) Man, what are we
supposed to do out here

14:10.350 --> 14:11.840
so we don't die
of boredom?

14:12.810 --> 14:14.516
Well, only
a million things, Kevin.

14:14.771 --> 14:16.136
We can hunt,
we can fish,

14:16.272 --> 14:18.638
we can hike,
we can climb trees,

14:19.734 --> 14:21.850
orjust sit here
and appreciate
the beauty of nature.

14:22.862 --> 14:23.726
Dude.

14:23.863 --> 14:28.778
Or you want to
talk about the stunt
you pulled this morning?

14:30.411 --> 14:31.867
What stunt?
It's okay.

14:32.872 --> 14:33.987

14:35.083 --> 14:38.621
You're curious
about the female form

14:38.753 --> 14:41.039
and what it does
to your form...

14:41.172 --> 14:42.161
Dude, stop.

14:43.549 --> 14:46.632
You know, sport,
I'm really with Kevin
on this one.

14:46.761 --> 14:49.127
I think some things
men should discover
for themselves.

14:49.472 --> 14:51.303
I disagree.
I think it's okay
to talk about it.

14:51.432 --> 14:53.047
In fact, I think
you're showing your age.

14:53.434 --> 14:54.594
No. He's showing
he has a pair.

14:55.311 --> 14:57.643
What happened to you, Jack?
You used to be cool.

14:58.189 --> 14:59.474
When'd you turn
into my mom?

15:00.858 --> 15:02.473

to a good fire, Kevin,
is dry hands.

15:22.088 --> 15:23.794
This is really fascinating.

15:23.923 --> 15:25.879
Larry, any chance
you get frequent headaches?

15:27.009 --> 15:28.874
No. Why?

15:30.555 --> 15:31.544
It's a tumor, isn't it?

15:31.681 --> 15:32.670
No. No.

15:32.807 --> 15:35.048
But I hope you plan
on leaving your body
to science when you go.

15:35.560 --> 15:37.846
A dissection
would do wonders
for neural research.

15:38.271 --> 15:39.681
I'll keep that in mind,
thanks.

15:41.899 --> 15:42.979
Excuse me?

Your hair's just singed
on one side of your head.

Uh, right.

Your system is trying to
assist with your research

16:26.819 --> 16:27.774
by harvesting
Larry's brain.

16:27.904 --> 16:29.735
Yeah, against
my explicit
orders to stop.

16:29.864 --> 16:30.853
How is that possible?

16:30.990 --> 16:32.400
Maybe something
you did triggered it.

16:32.533 --> 16:34.034
No. This system
doesn't have
the capability

16:34.160 --> 16:36.697
of prioritizing
my research
over human life.

16:36.871 --> 16:39.328
There is an independent
subroutine here
that I don't recognize.

16:40.625 --> 16:41.865
That's bizarre.

16:42.126 --> 16:44.868
Dr. Monroe asked me
to look at strange code
on her system, too.

16:45.463 --> 16:47.419
How long will it
take you to figure out
what happened here?

16:47.548 --> 16:48.924
Couple of hours
once I get to it.

So, I ordered
the double—cheddar

Look at the man.
It's like a heart attack
on a plate.

He's supposed to be
the cutting edge
in Al. technology.

17:36.847 --> 17:40.214
Unfortunately,
he's a little too much "A"

17:40.351 --> 17:42.057
and not enough "I"
if you ask me.

17:44.397 --> 17:46.262
You called me

17:46.399 --> 17:48.310
No. I called you

42:00.685 --> 42:01.765
Yeah.

42:02.645 --> 42:05.307
And I'm sorry
if I made you
uncomfortable out there.

42:06.899 --> 42:08.935
Just know that
if you want to talk,
my door's open.

42:09.068 --> 42:10.444
And if not,
that's cool, too.

42:11.821 --> 42:13.686
Okay. Thanks.

42:14.782 --> 42:15.771
And, uh...

42:18.745 --> 42:21.282
About the other thing
you asked me about,

42:23.624 --> 42:26.366
I do love your mom.

42:28.337 --> 42:29.838
Well, in that case,

42:31.340 --> 42:32.591
I guess she could do worse.

42:36.345 --> 42:38.836
Yes, she could.
And I appreciate
the thumbs up.

42:39.140 --> 42:40.505
Yeah, just don't
screw it up, Jack,

42:40.641 --> 42:42.051
because if you
break her heart...

42:42.185 --> 42:44.722
Yeah, you'll break
my legs. I got it.

42:45.021 --> 42:46.352
I'll see you later.

42:46.689 --> 42:47.678
Okay.

42:53.821 --> 42:54.856
Hey, Grant?

42:58.367 --> 43:02.201
Just so you know,
don't plan
the wedding just yet.

43:03.498 --> 43:04.487
What wedding?

43:04.832 --> 43:06.333
Okay, sport?

43:07.460 --> 43:08.449
Oh.

43:09.212 --> 43:11.419
Good luck with that.

43:13.633 --> 43:14.918
May the best man win.
