All right!

00:27.628 --> 00:30.098
Titans!
Your attention, please.

00:30.131 --> 00:31.799
Move it.

00:32.400 --> 00:33.367
Hey, listen to me,

00:33.401 --> 00:35.503
none of you have done
any chores for weeks.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.338
The tower is disgusting.

00:43.211 --> 00:44.312
Didn't notice.

00:44.345 --> 00:46.046
You're getting crumbs
all over the floor right now.

00:47.281 --> 00:48.416
- If we all pitch in to clean up...
- Come on!

00:48.449 --> 00:49.750
We can't sees, fool.

00:49.783 --> 00:51.385
Move, get out of the way.

00:51.419 --> 00:53.821
We are trying to watch
the awards program.

00:54.288 --> 00:55.523
An awards program?

00:55.556 --> 00:56.757
Those are terrible.

00:56.790 --> 01:00.561
It's just hours of awkward
banter and boring retrospectives

01:00.594 --> 01:03.464
and the worst part is, the awards
themselves are meaningless.

01:03.497 --> 01:05.266
Meaningless?
Are you crazy, dude?

01:05.299 --> 01:06.834
Awards satisfy
our irrational need

01:06.867 --> 01:08.636
to be validated
by being given a statue

01:08.669 --> 01:10.471
based on completely
arbitrary metrics.

01:10.504 --> 01:12.140
Quiet! They're about
to give the award

01:12.173 --> 01:14.108
to the person who is
"Best in a Specific Category."

01:14.275 --> 01:15.743
Ooh! I hope
the person we wanna win

01:15.776 --> 01:18.212
wins the award for being best
in that specific category.

01:18.246 --> 01:20.281
Yo, if the person we wants
to win doesn't win,

01:20.314 --> 01:21.515
I'mma lose my mind!

01:21.849 --> 01:23.851
I am getting the mad.

01:24.218 --> 01:26.254
Just thinking about
how unfair it is

01:26.420 --> 01:28.522
that the person I want to win
in the "Specific Category"

01:28.556 --> 01:31.459
could do the losing to the someone
I believe to be less qualified.

01:33.394 --> 01:34.462
You're already getting worked up

01:34.495 --> 01:36.197
- over this thing happening.
- Shush, shush, shush.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.666
Shush the mouth!
Shush the mouth hole!

01:38.699 --> 01:40.268
They're about
to indicate the winner.

01:44.638 --> 01:45.806
- They gave that person?
- Seriously?

01:45.839 --> 01:47.675
He's not the best in that category.

01:47.708 --> 01:49.210
Yo, he just ain't.

01:49.243 --> 01:51.312
This is a bunch of poop.

01:51.512 --> 01:54.315
Wow, that is some
strong language, mama.

01:54.482 --> 01:56.150
But I agree, this is some poop.

01:56.317 --> 01:57.451
Straight up, stinking poo.

01:57.485 --> 01:58.486
How do you even know that?

01:58.619 --> 01:59.620
It's just your opinion.

01:59.653 --> 02:02.456
Don't you see that awards
are a pointless charade?

02:02.490 --> 02:05.359
Yous just mad 'cause you
never got no awards. Never!

02:06.794 --> 02:09.163
Even if, I got an award,
I wouldn't care

02:09.197 --> 02:10.398
because awards are meaningless.

02:10.664 --> 02:11.732
Well you sound super bitter.

02:11.765 --> 02:13.267
Who even decides the winners?

02:16.470 --> 02:17.771
The Academy!

02:17.938 --> 02:20.208
And who is this, "Academy"?

02:20.241 --> 02:21.642
You know.

02:23.377 --> 02:24.512
The Acad...

02:24.545 --> 02:27.381
Will you just do your chores, please?

02:27.548 --> 02:29.217
Not until the show of awards

02:29.250 --> 02:30.418
has come to an end.

02:30.451 --> 02:31.752
There's only four more hours

02:31.785 --> 02:33.854
and we can't miss
a single moment.

02:33.887 --> 02:36.190
Nows quiet, I wants
to hear this gentleman

02:36.224 --> 02:37.758
thanks a bunch
of people I don't know.

02:38.526 --> 02:39.560
Hmm.

02:44.765 --> 02:46.534
Dude, if you gotta
go pee, just go.

02:46.800 --> 02:48.402
I don't have to pee.

02:48.569 --> 02:50.804
Didn't you hear?
It's happening!

02:50.838 --> 02:52.673
What's you talkin' about, bro?

02:52.873 --> 02:55.743
The first annual
Teen Titan Awards!

02:57.578 --> 02:59.547
Never heard of
a Teen Titan Awards.

02:59.580 --> 03:01.749
They're awards that go
to the Titan

03:01.782 --> 03:03.851
who is the best
in a specific category.

03:03.884 --> 03:05.419
Whats you get if you win?

03:05.586 --> 03:08.456
Oh, just a little golden statue.

03:08.489 --> 03:11.225
Wow, that is very classy.

03:11.425 --> 03:12.893
Ooh, I really, really want one.

03:13.361 --> 03:14.762
Well, in order to get one,

03:14.795 --> 03:16.264
you'll need
to prove that you are

03:16.297 --> 03:18.366
the best in these
specific categories.

03:18.399 --> 03:20.668
"Dishwasher," "Trash Remover,"
"Laundry Doer".

03:20.701 --> 03:22.936
and "Person Who Kept
their Crumbs off the Floor."

03:22.970 --> 03:24.972
I will do anything for an award!

03:25.005 --> 03:26.874
- Who's judging this?
- The Academy.

03:26.907 --> 03:28.309
Ah, of course.

03:28.542 --> 03:29.543
You'd better get to work.

03:30.478 --> 03:31.379
The Teen Titans Awards
are next week.

03:31.412 --> 03:32.346
And you'll need
to convince the Academy

03:32.380 --> 03:35.316
that you are the best in a
"Specific Category."

03:38.352 --> 03:39.953
Great Scott, it's filthy.

03:41.589 --> 03:43.857
1.21 gigawatts, 88 minutes.

03:44.492 --> 03:46.860
Okay, dishes, I am sending you

03:46.894 --> 03:47.895
to the future!

04:04.812 --> 04:06.547
Time to go home, fool.

04:31.739 --> 04:34.808
My papa always said,
"Life was like a floor of crumbs.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.744
"You never know
what you're gonna get."

04:36.910 --> 04:38.879
You got bread crumbs,
cracker crumbs,

04:38.912 --> 04:41.349
cookie crumbs, pizza crumbs,
potato chip crumbs

04:41.382 --> 04:43.751
cupcake crumbs,
cheesy crumbs, mystery crumbs.

04:43.951 --> 04:44.985
That's uh...

04:45.519 --> 04:46.554
That's 'bout all the crumbs.

04:57.831 --> 04:58.799
Great work, Titans.

04:58.832 --> 05:00.768
I think your irrational need
to be validated

05:00.801 --> 05:01.802
by being given a statue based on

05:01.835 --> 05:04.004
completely arbitrary metrics
will be fulfilled.

05:04.037 --> 05:06.940
Now, let's get ready.
It's showtime!

05:08.041 --> 05:10.444
Live, from the epicenter of entertainment,

05:10.611 --> 05:13.381
a night to honor the most
talented heroes on earth.

05:15.549 --> 05:17.685
It's the Teen Titan Awards!

05:18.151 --> 05:19.453
Ladies and Gentlemen,

05:19.487 --> 05:21.589
your host, Birdarang!

05:21.622 --> 05:22.723
What's up, everybody?

05:22.756 --> 05:25.526
Welcome to the first annual
Teen Titan Awards.

05:25.759 --> 05:28.362
So many
A-list Titans here tonight.

05:28.562 --> 05:30.698
And Robin came too.

05:33.066 --> 05:35.436
Now, throw your hands in the
air for our first presenters

05:35.469 --> 05:37.638
Sticky Joe and the Tooth Fairy.

05:42.042 --> 05:43.444
We are here to present

05:43.477 --> 05:45.012
the award for "Best Dishwasher".

05:45.045 --> 05:46.380
Da-da-ra-da-da.

05:46.414 --> 05:47.415
Hey!

05:48.348 --> 05:50.418
So, Sticky Joe, they say
dish washing happens

05:50.451 --> 05:52.620
- mostly in the kitchen.
- Hey!

05:52.920 --> 05:54.688
But tonight's nominees
have shown us

05:54.722 --> 05:56.590
that it really happens in here.

05:56.624 --> 05:58.659
- Da-da-ra-da-da.
- Hey!

05:58.826 --> 06:01.395
And the title goes to,
Da-da-ra-da-da.

06:01.429 --> 06:03.531
- Please, please, please.
- Hope it's me, hope it's me.

06:03.564 --> 06:04.565
Hey!

06:06.166 --> 06:07.468
Robin.

06:09.670 --> 06:11.705
- Hey!
- Hey, get off me, man.

06:15.576 --> 06:17.911
Oh, thank you so much for this.

06:18.145 --> 06:21.014
Ha, I've got
so many people to thank.

06:21.048 --> 06:21.982
Uh, Batman.

06:22.015 --> 06:24.017
I wouldn't be here without you.

06:24.184 --> 06:25.719
Superman...

06:25.753 --> 06:28.088
Uh, okay,
also, uh, thank you to Alfred,

06:28.121 --> 06:30.424
at Wayne Manor and uh,
everyone who gave

06:30.458 --> 06:32.159
a circus boy the chance
of a lifetime. Thank you.

06:32.926 --> 06:35.563
- So happy for you.
- Yeah, congratulations.

06:36.063 --> 06:37.731
Who's a pretty, sparkly statue?

06:38.699 --> 06:41.535
She's an octopus,
he's an ice unicycle.

06:41.735 --> 06:43.471
Give it up for our
next presenters,

06:43.504 --> 06:44.505
The Wonder Twins.

06:53.847 --> 06:57.718
Uh, and the award for "Best
Trash Remover" goes to...

06:57.751 --> 07:00.020
- Come on, I want this so bad.
- Please, please.

07:00.053 --> 07:01.154
Robin.

07:05.493 --> 07:06.560
This is poop.

07:06.594 --> 07:08.195
Agreed. The poop.

07:08.929 --> 07:10.063
Yeah! It's time

07:10.097 --> 07:12.666
we did something
about this injustices.

07:13.901 --> 07:16.637
Wow, uh, I never expected this.

07:16.837 --> 07:18.839
Uh, yes, lightning
does strike twice.

07:18.872 --> 07:19.873
Ow!

07:20.974 --> 07:22.776
Gimme those. Let's see who
the winners are tonight.

07:23.010 --> 07:24.111
Robin, Robin.

07:24.612 --> 07:25.813
Robin, Robin, Robin!

07:25.979 --> 07:27.948
They all say Robin.

07:28.248 --> 07:30.083
You rigged the game, yo.

07:30.250 --> 07:32.520
I assure you, The Academy
made those decisions

07:32.553 --> 07:35.022
based on very specific
and fair judging criteria.

07:35.188 --> 07:36.223
We know there's no Academy.

07:36.256 --> 07:37.491
You just made
this whole thing up

07:37.525 --> 07:38.526
to get us to do chores.

07:39.593 --> 07:39.993
Of course there's an Academy.

07:53.106 --> 07:54.207
They's real?

07:55.275 --> 07:57.477
So, Robin really did
win all the awards?

07:57.878 --> 07:59.913
Yes, we judged him
to be the best.

08:00.080 --> 08:02.816
Though, honestly, the decision
was a bit arbitrary.

08:02.850 --> 08:06.219
We recognized his name
and assumed he was superior.

08:06.253 --> 08:08.055
Also, Bruce Wayne
sponsors the show

08:08.088 --> 08:09.823
but that did not influence us.

08:12.025 --> 08:13.026
You sure about that?

08:14.161 --> 08:16.196
Hmm, sounds like a really big
conflict of interest.

08:16.697 --> 08:19.166
You dare question
the integrity of the Academy?

08:19.633 --> 08:21.602
You shall be punished
for such impudence.

08:21.869 --> 08:23.571
Your award has been revoked.

08:24.137 --> 08:26.707
Wait. No, please,
not my sweet baby.

08:26.907 --> 08:27.908
Not my precious.

08:31.645 --> 08:32.913
You have been snubbed.

08:33.046 --> 08:36.216
Snubbed? No!

08:39.753 --> 08:41.088
We can still beat 'em, Robin.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.322
By summoning the power

08:42.355 --> 08:45.959
of one of the most
awarded movies in history.

08:46.159 --> 08:47.661
Titans.

08:47.695 --> 08:48.896
Fly, you fools!

08:50.864 --> 08:53.166
Hold up, yo. You all need
to chill for a hot minute

08:53.200 --> 08:55.903
so we can do the emotional
"In Memorium" montage,

08:55.936 --> 08:58.305
where we say, "Peace out"
to those we've lost.

09:23.096 --> 09:24.231
You will be missed.

09:41.849 --> 09:43.150
Ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya, ya!

09:59.166 --> 10:01.669
You shall not pass.

10:22.690 --> 10:24.992
It's over, Academy. We've won.

10:25.025 --> 10:26.193
Oh, snap.

10:26.226 --> 10:27.661
That was ridonculous.

10:27.928 --> 10:29.329
For the final award of the night,

10:29.362 --> 10:31.231
the winner of this battle is...

10:31.398 --> 10:33.934
Please be us,
please be us, please be us.

10:34.101 --> 10:35.869
The Academy.

10:35.903 --> 10:38.772
Oh, come on!

10:39.740 --> 10:42.309
Oh, the Teen Titans will never

10:42.910 --> 10:45.345
ever get an award.

10:45.746 --> 10:47.647
We know.
