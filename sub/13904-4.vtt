00:05.253 --> 00:07.293
What are you trying to say to the reader?

00:09.573 --> 00:11.533
I want you.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.893
I think about you at night.

00:21.893 --> 00:23.813
It just feels a bit stuck.

00:24.893 --> 00:26.733
Like you've hit a wall.

00:26.733 --> 00:28.813
- Look, I think it's great...
- But...

00:28.813 --> 00:30.853
Well, maybe we just need a different tack.

00:32.653 --> 00:34.573
Like, 'What is kinky?

00:35.813 --> 00:37.853
Why does 'different' do it for some men?

00:40.773 --> 00:42.733
Could you find someone unusual?

00:42.733 --> 00:44.613
Would you be up for that?

00:45.053 --> 00:47.013
Yeah.

00:47.013 --> 00:49.013
I mean, yeah, I'd be... I'd very, very...

00:49.293 --> 00:51.213
up for that.

01:30.373 --> 01:33.573
Duncan shouldn't be trying to
pair you up with some weirdo.

01:33.573 --> 01:35.893
He's your editor, yeah,
he's not your pimp.

01:35.893 --> 01:39.213
- No, it's just research.
- Hannah, you're on his books to make money.

01:39.213 --> 01:41.253
That's what you are to him. A cash cow.

01:41.253 --> 01:43.333
That's sweet, Ben, and really nicely put!

01:43.333 --> 01:45.493
How's your lovely girlfriend, by the way?

01:48.453 --> 01:50.373
All right, all right!

01:50.373 --> 01:52.573
How's my lovely sister, by the way?

01:52.573 --> 01:55.653
It wasn't meant to go on
like this. You know, develop.

01:55.653 --> 01:58.013
There is a traditional way
of dealing with that, Ben.

01:58.013 --> 01:59.893
We call it 'finishing' with someone.

01:59.893 --> 02:02.413
Why don't you help me
here? You're her sister.

02:02.413 --> 02:04.133
- It's better coming from you.
-What?

02:04.133 --> 02:06.013
Yeah, if you spoke to her for me,

02:06.013 --> 02:08.413
she'd have you there,
wouldn't she? For support.

02:08.413 --> 02:10.252
No way. Your problem, you deal with it.

02:11.213 --> 02:13.253
Hi, Ben. Hey...

02:13.253 --> 02:15.133
Hi, babes.

02:15.573 --> 02:18.093
So, how's that rich guy?
You still seeing him?

02:18.093 --> 02:20.693
No, although he did
stay at mine last night.

02:20.693 --> 02:23.093
- He just needed somewhere to crash.
- Did he pay you?

02:23.093 --> 02:24.973
Course not! It was a laugh.

02:24.973 --> 02:26.933
He's taking the piss, Bambi.

02:26.933 --> 02:28.813
I'm happy, is that a crime?

02:28.813 --> 02:30.773
God, I hope I never turn out like you.

02:30.773 --> 02:32.533
- What?
- A cynical old prozzie.

02:33.853 --> 02:36.573
- I just don't want you to get hurt.
- You don't even know him.

02:36.573 --> 02:39.693
Well, I know that he's loaded
and I know he's not paying you.

02:39.693 --> 02:42.213
The longer it goes on, the worse
it'll be when it goes wrong.

02:42.213 --> 02:44.133
And it has to go wrong, does it?

02:47.133 --> 02:49.853
Yeah. It is me we're
talking about, isn't it?

02:49.853 --> 02:51.693
No, it's not you, it's just... the job.

02:55.413 --> 02:57.413
Maybe they'll be the
exception to the rule.

02:59.973 --> 03:01.893
Yeah, maybe.

03:17.373 --> 03:20.013
So, I located Mr Kinky Sexy...

03:20.013 --> 03:21.773
Des.

03:21.773 --> 03:24.573
Now, I have to warm the
custard to body temperature...

03:28.053 --> 03:29.973
How am I supposed to know when...

03:32.493 --> 03:34.453
Why didn't I listen in cookery?

03:36.053 --> 03:38.573
Now, for this client, I
have to look impeccable.

03:48.733 --> 03:50.653
- Hi, Des.
- Hi, Belle.

03:52.293 --> 03:54.213
Good to meet you.

03:56.773 --> 03:58.813
You look nice.

03:58.813 --> 04:01.053
Oh, this is for you before I forget.

04:01.053 --> 04:02.933
Thanks, Des.

04:02.933 --> 04:04.813
May I er...?

04:07.653 --> 04:09.493
Thanks. Lovely.

04:09.493 --> 04:11.413
Oh, I've got a change of clothes with me.

04:12.173 --> 04:14.093
Thanks for getting dressed up.

04:15.133 --> 04:17.053
Oh, that is a lovely spread!

04:18.012 --> 04:19.853
- Perfect.
- Yeah?

04:19.853 --> 04:21.733
- I made it!
- Really?

04:21.733 --> 04:23.693
Fantastic!

04:23.693 --> 04:25.413
And this is your first time, is it?

04:25.413 --> 04:27.453
- Yeah.
- Oh, that's brilliant.

04:27.453 --> 04:29.493
It's great when someone new comes to it.

04:29.493 --> 04:31.693
You are gonna love it.

04:31.693 --> 04:33.693
It's just about letting go. You know...

04:34.013 --> 04:36.333
- Is there somewhere I can pop this?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

04:36.333 --> 04:38.533
- It's just... it's just in there.
- Oh, right.

04:45.173 --> 04:47.053
Sploshing,

04:47.053 --> 04:49.533
the art of getting wet...

04:49.533 --> 04:51.413
and down and dirty.

05:04.493 --> 05:06.293
I might just...

05:06.293 --> 05:08.333
Yeah, great.

05:22.253 --> 05:24.613
Oh, that's wicked, that is.

05:25.293 --> 05:27.133
Good.

05:29.893 --> 05:31.773
I'm into everything, me.

05:31.773 --> 05:33.693
- You know...
- Yeah?

05:33.693 --> 05:35.413
Yeah. Mud... Mm...

05:36.493 --> 05:38.453
- Water...
- Yeah...

05:38.453 --> 05:40.253
Beans...

05:40.253 --> 05:42.173
- Pasta...
- Beans!

05:42.173 --> 05:44.053
Pasta!

05:44.693 --> 05:46.853
My ex-girlfriend...

05:46.853 --> 05:49.333
we used to see how many
beans we could fit...

05:49.333 --> 05:51.413
- in her bikini...
- Yeah?

05:51.413 --> 05:53.133
Yeah. I'd like beans...

05:54.133 --> 05:55.813
in my bikini.

06:01.013 --> 06:02.933
Oh, you dirty girl!

06:10.533 --> 06:12.293
Oh, hang about...

06:12.293 --> 06:14.053
you're going to make me come.

06:14.053 --> 06:16.133
Is that a problem?

06:16.133 --> 06:18.013
No, no, it's er...

06:19.733 --> 06:21.493
Are you ready for some?

06:21.493 --> 06:23.493
Yeah. Great.

06:23.493 --> 06:25.253
Right, choose any of them.

06:25.253 --> 06:27.013
Throw it at me. Aim for the face.

06:27.013 --> 06:28.973
Ok.

06:30.013 --> 06:31.853
Are you ready for this?

06:31.853 --> 06:33.733
Oh, no.... don't.

06:36.773 --> 06:38.573
Wow!

06:42.173 --> 06:43.853
My eyes! I can't see!

06:43.853 --> 06:45.733
Oh, hang on.

06:45.733 --> 06:47.533
- Here's a towel.
- Oh, thanks.

06:50.613 --> 06:52.533
- Are you all right?
- Yeah...

06:52.533 --> 06:54.413
I just...

06:59.493 --> 07:01.133
- Right...
- Are you all right?

07:01.133 --> 07:02.933
Yeah. Ok...

07:02.933 --> 07:04.653
What shall we do now, then?

07:04.653 --> 07:06.573
I don't mind. You choose.

07:06.573 --> 07:08.333
No, no... you choose.

07:08.333 --> 07:10.213
- Beans?
- Beans...

07:14.173 --> 07:15.973
You're gonna love this.

07:15.973 --> 07:17.773
Yeah, I can feel I am.

07:17.773 --> 07:19.573
- Top or bottom?
- Surprise me!

07:19.573 --> 07:21.373
- Knickers then.
- Ok!

07:30.493 --> 07:32.213
- Is that all of them?
- No, no, no.

07:32.213 --> 07:34.773
I'm just seeing how you like
it. A bit faster or slower?

07:34.773 --> 07:36.933
I really don't mind.
There's more, is there?

07:38.853 --> 07:40.853
You're not enjoying any of this, are you?

07:41.123 --> 07:44.163
- there's no point carrying on if you don't like it.
- No, it's just...

07:44.163 --> 07:46.283
just my ankle, then my eye, the cream...

07:46.283 --> 07:48.163
- It's only cream.
- Yeah.

07:49.843 --> 07:52.003
Look, I... I think I
better clean up and go.

07:52.643 --> 07:54.523
It's obviously not your thing.

07:54.523 --> 07:57.523
I just... I just think I'm not
the right girl to splosh with.

07:59.003 --> 08:00.963
- All right.
- All right.

08:08.523 --> 08:10.443
How am I gonna write that up?

08:12.003 --> 08:14.043
I'm gonna need some help.

08:14.043 --> 08:16.003
A firm editorial hand...

08:17.443 --> 08:19.323
What?!

08:21.603 --> 08:23.523
'The Rules' are there to be broken.

08:25.083 --> 08:27.403
Now what I'm about to do requires courage,

08:27.403 --> 08:29.603
focus...

08:29.603 --> 08:31.923
and most important of all the right...

08:35.043 --> 08:37.003
shoes.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.602
I love you!

08:48.843 --> 08:50.763
- Hello.
- Hi.

08:51.803 --> 08:53.843
Where is everyone?

08:53.843 --> 08:55.723
Oh, they're at a sales conference.

08:57.683 --> 09:00.043
- The event of the year.
- But you're not there...

09:00.883 --> 09:02.803
No.

09:05.443 --> 09:07.363
Won't you be missed?

09:08.523 --> 09:12.243
Lots of people telling each other
how fantastic their departments are

09:12.243 --> 09:14.123
isn't my idea of fun.

09:17.203 --> 09:19.123
What is your idea of fun, Duncan?

09:24.043 --> 09:27.123
That dress, the cut of it...

09:27.123 --> 09:29.403
How would you get into
something like that?

09:29.403 --> 09:31.283
It's got a zip.

09:31.563 --> 09:33.483
Here. See?

09:34.283 --> 09:36.203
And the shoes? Do you like these?

09:37.323 --> 09:39.123
Yeah, they're great.

09:39.123 --> 09:40.923
Very erm...

09:40.923 --> 09:42.803
Fuckable?

09:44.123 --> 09:45.923
I was going to say vintage.

09:45.923 --> 09:47.963
Duncan...

09:47.963 --> 09:51.003
- Belle...
- Can we just tell the truth?

09:51.003 --> 09:52.803
That'sa big ask for this time of day.

09:53.283 --> 09:55.243
But we can try.

09:55.483 --> 09:57.443
You go first.

10:07.883 --> 10:09.643
Sorry, that was...

10:09.643 --> 10:11.523
a really bad idea, wasn't it?

10:12.363 --> 10:14.323
Yeah, that was...

10:18.803 --> 10:20.723
really...

10:22.923 --> 10:24.843
terrible.

10:59.929 --> 11:01.849
This is great, isn't it?

11:09.969 --> 11:11.849
I thought you said a picnic.

11:14.889 --> 11:16.769
- Jackie...
- Yeah?

11:18.729 --> 11:20.889
- I can't do this.
- You can.

11:20.889 --> 11:23.689
You're doing it, look. It's
only like riding a bike.

11:29.609 --> 11:31.529
No, I mean us.

11:33.809 --> 11:35.769
Oh, right...

11:36.849 --> 11:38.809
Right...

12:09.129 --> 12:11.009
Hiya. I got you a bike.

12:12.529 --> 12:15.249
- Yeah?
- But I forgot to buy a bloody lock thing for it,

12:15.249 --> 12:17.329
so we'd best get it
up there quick, anyway.

12:19.729 --> 12:21.649
You all right? You look a bit...

12:22.609 --> 12:24.449
I need to talk to you.

12:24.449 --> 12:26.329
Ok...

12:40.489 --> 12:42.369
What?

12:43.489 --> 12:45.409
You can't just turn up here.

12:52.249 --> 12:54.209
Well, you're scaring me now.

12:54.209 --> 12:56.249
- No, please. I'm serious.
- What? Don't...

12:58.809 --> 13:01.209
We met because...

13:01.209 --> 13:03.049
you wanted to pay me for sex...

13:04.169 --> 13:06.069
- and... and now... now...
- Now we don't have to do all that.

13:07.351 --> 13:09.311
- No, no, we don't.
- But...

13:09.311 --> 13:11.271
We're in very different positions here.

13:12.311 --> 13:14.551
You were my client and I'm a prostitute,

13:14.551 --> 13:16.631
- and that's never going to go away.
- I don't care.

13:16.631 --> 13:18.511
- Not now.
- But you will.

13:20.351 --> 13:23.191
And it'll be worse because
we'll be totally involved.

13:24.351 --> 13:26.431
I don't wanna get hurt like that.

13:26.431 --> 13:28.231
- I won't hurt you.
- You don't know that.

13:30.311 --> 13:32.231
Is it because you think I'm odd? No.

13:32.231 --> 13:34.311
- No, no, it's not you...
- Stupid...

13:34.311 --> 13:36.191
fucking bike!

13:41.511 --> 13:43.431
I have to go. I'm late...

13:44.511 --> 13:46.431
for a client.

14:52.311 --> 14:54.191
The afternoon I was expecting.

14:54.751 --> 14:56.511
How are you?

14:56.511 --> 14:58.631
I am very...

14:58.631 --> 15:00.511
Er very...

15:02.911 --> 15:04.631
I can't think of the word.

15:04.631 --> 15:06.551
Call yourself an editor.

15:07.951 --> 15:09.791
Do you have to be anywhere?

15:09.791 --> 15:11.511
No.

15:11.511 --> 15:13.311
Good.

15:13.311 --> 15:15.231
You?

15:15.631 --> 15:17.951
No...

15:17.951 --> 15:19.551
But...

15:19.551 --> 15:21.431
We should probably...

15:22.831 --> 15:25.031
They'll be coming back soon.

15:25.031 --> 15:27.391
- Really?
- Most of them will go to the pub,

15:27.391 --> 15:29.511
but one or two of the keen boys might not.

15:29.511 --> 15:31.391
The poetry lot.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.351
Do you need a cab?

15:35.111 --> 15:37.031
No, I'm fine. I'll...

15:37.031 --> 15:38.911
I'll just walk.

15:40.031 --> 15:41.911
- You sure?
- Yeah.

15:44.671 --> 15:46.591
It's been nice...

15:46.591 --> 15:48.511
being with you.

15:48.511 --> 15:50.431
Sounds a bit final.

15:51.271 --> 15:53.111
It wasn't meant to.

15:53.111 --> 15:54.791
You're probably right.

15:54.791 --> 15:56.711
One-offs are always the best.

16:16.711 --> 16:18.911
Hey.

16:21.951 --> 16:23.871
Hey!

16:24.031 --> 16:25.951
Hey.

16:28.111 --> 16:30.031
What's the matter?

16:34.711 --> 16:36.791
Nothing.

16:36.791 --> 16:38.671
I finished it with Jackie.

16:40.431 --> 16:42.391
You don't look... elated.

16:44.031 --> 16:46.471
Please don't tell me you
realise she's 'the one'.

16:46.471 --> 16:48.751
I don't think I could take
it after the day I've had.

16:48.751 --> 16:50.631
No. She's not the one.

16:51.511 --> 16:53.991
I just don't feel
particularly good about it.

16:53.991 --> 16:55.911
Or myself.

16:55.911 --> 16:58.111
Well, you had to end
it sometime, didn't you?

16:59.431 --> 17:01.311
So why has your day been shit?

17:01.311 --> 17:03.191
Well...

17:04.590 --> 17:06.511
I...

17:07.471 --> 17:10.111
I had a client who almost
blinded me. Wasn't great.

17:11.590 --> 17:15.471
And... then I saw Duncan.

17:15.471 --> 17:17.391
You shagged him, didn't you? Did I?

17:17.391 --> 17:19.351
Did I?

17:19.351 --> 17:21.511
I probably think I did. Yep.

17:21.511 --> 17:23.271
Well, it's what you wanted, wasn't it?

17:23.271 --> 17:26.431
- Yeah, sort of.
- What, you've gone off him now that he's into you?

17:26.431 --> 17:28.550
No, no. It's the
opposite. He's not into me.

17:28.831 --> 17:30.711
It was just a quick...

17:31.111 --> 17:33.231
Well, it wasn't quick...

17:33.231 --> 17:35.111
- I don't want to know!
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

17:35.791 --> 17:37.711
Now you know how I felt about Jackie.

17:37.711 --> 17:39.671
At least Duncan's not your sister.

17:43.591 --> 17:45.511
That's nice.

17:46.671 --> 17:48.511
- You can have one slice.
- I will.

17:50.991 --> 17:52.911
Jackie?

17:53.751 --> 17:55.671
Jack?

18:02.071 --> 18:03.871
- Bambi?
-  Can I come up?

18:03.871 --> 18:05.751
Yeah, ok.

18:14.631 --> 18:17.551
"Hi, Han, it's me. I'm home.

18:17.551 --> 18:22.271
Patrick wants to talk. I guess
we've got a lot to talk about.

18:22.271 --> 18:24.511
Anyhow, look, thanks
for having me and erm...

18:25.751 --> 18:27.991
by the way, your best friend's a wanker."

18:48.591 --> 18:50.551
I did it.

18:51.511 --> 18:53.511
I told Byron...

18:53.511 --> 18:55.751
you know, that it just
wasn't gonna work out.

18:57.671 --> 18:59.391
How did he take it?

18:59.391 --> 19:01.271
Er... all right.

19:03.031 --> 19:05.151
I really think it's just
better to cut him off

19:05.151 --> 19:07.031
before you get too into him.

19:08.111 --> 19:10.031
Yeah, I suppose...

19:10.951 --> 19:13.111
- All for the best.
- Yeah.

19:13.111 --> 19:14.951
Cheers.

19:14.951 --> 19:16.831
Cheers.

19:18.191 --> 19:20.071
Who needs boys...

19:20.711 --> 19:22.791
when you've got girls and Champagne?

19:26.071 --> 19:28.271
Have you been making toast?

19:28.271 --> 19:30.471
No, I just got in. Why, do you want some?

19:30.471 --> 19:32.351
No, no... I can smell it.

19:35.951 --> 19:38.071
So can I. I think it's
coming from outside.

19:41.951 --> 19:43.871
Oh, my God!

19:48.591 --> 19:50.551
Byron!

19:51.471 --> 19:53.391
Byron!

20:18.831 --> 20:20.991
It wasn't meant to rain.

20:34.071 --> 20:35.871
What is kinky?

20:35.871 --> 20:37.751
Something with kinks or twists...

20:38.671 --> 20:40.591
Well, that's all of us, isn't it?

20:40.871 --> 20:43.791
It's just a matter of finding
who fits with your kinks.

20:43.791 --> 20:45.711
To be loved unconditionally...

20:47.191 --> 20:49.111
that would be something.

22:12.112 --> 22:15.612
