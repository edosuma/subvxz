I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

You didn't tell me
your friend was a girl.

08:41.440 --> 08:43.400

08:43.480 --> 08:45.940

across the entire world

so you could tell me no!

09:00.000 --> 09:01.130
No.

09:01.210 --> 09:03.090
But there must be
other female waterbenders

09:03.170 --> 09:04.210
in your tribe.

09:04.340 --> 09:06.380
Here, the women learn from Yagoda

09:06.460 --> 09:08.340

09:13.430 --> 09:15.560

09:15.720 --> 09:17.180

09:17.310 --> 09:19.850
But our tribe has customs, rules.

09:25.520 --> 09:26.530
Then what?

09:27.030 --> 09:28.610
Then I won't learn from you!

09:28.690 --> 09:30.860
Well, have fun teaching yourself.

12:11.940 --> 12:14.070
Your grandmother
had an arranged marriage

12:51.400 --> 12:52.400
( DOOR CLOSES )

12:52.610 --> 12:54.360
( HUMMING )

13:17.720 --> 13:18.800
Whoa!

13:18.970 --> 13:20.930
Careful with the blasting jelly.

13:23.430 --> 13:24.430
-( SQUEAK )
- Ooh!

13:25.640 --> 13:26.850
Uncle?

13:27.060 --> 13:28.430
Uncle, is that you?

13:51.370 --> 13:52.370
( SQUAWK )

13:58.590 --> 13:59.590
Aah!

14:03.260 --> 14:04.300
( ZUKO SCREAMING )

14:11.480 --> 14:12.480
Zuko!

14:21.030 --> 14:22.610
Zuko.

14:33.670 --> 14:35.500
Hi, Princess Yue.

14:35.580 --> 14:37.250
I made you something.

14:37.340 --> 14:38.630
I carved it myself.

14:39.300 --> 14:40.550
It's a bear.

14:40.630 --> 14:43.430
Actually, it's supposed to be a fish.

14:43.510 --> 14:45.340
See, it has a fin.

14:45.550 --> 14:46.970
Oh.

14:47.470 --> 14:50.350
I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

14:50.560 --> 14:52.480
I shouldn't have
asked you to come here.

14:56.730 --> 14:57.730
( GRUNTS )

15:00.570 --> 15:02.030
KATARA: How's warrior training going?

15:02.360 --> 15:03.490
( GROWLS )

15:03.700 --> 15:04.950
That bad?

15:05.160 --> 15:06.950
No, it's Princess Yue.

15:07.030 --> 15:08.200
I don't get it.

15:08.280 --> 15:09.620
One minute,
she wants to go out with me,

15:09.700 --> 15:11.160
and the next,
she's telling me to get lost.

15:12.080 --> 15:14.080
So, how's waterbending training?

15:14.290 --> 15:18.090
Master Poop-head won't teach her
because she's a girl.

15:18.290 --> 15:20.420
Why don't you just teach her, Aang?

15:20.880 --> 15:22.710
Why didn't I think of that?

15:23.130 --> 15:24.430
At night, you can teach me

15:24.510 --> 15:26.640
whatever moves
you learn from Master Pakku.

15:26.720 --> 15:28.390
That way,
you have someone to practice with,

15:28.470 --> 15:30.010
and I get to learn waterbending.

15:30.100 --> 15:31.850
Everyone's happy!

15:31.930 --> 15:33.230
I'm not happy.

15:33.310 --> 15:34.440
But you're never happy.

15:34.520 --> 15:35.770
Come on, Aang.

15:40.900 --> 15:42.190
Master Pakku said this move

15:42.280 --> 15:45.320
is all about sinking and floating.

15:47.360 --> 15:48.370
I got it!

15:50.160 --> 15:51.450
That was amazing!

15:51.660 --> 15:52.790
That wasn't me.

15:55.040 --> 15:57.370
I was just showing Katara a few moves.

15:57.540 --> 15:59.040
You have disrespected me,

15:59.130 --> 16:01.630
my teachings, and my entire culture.

16:01.710 --> 16:02.750
I'm sorry, I...

16:02.840 --> 16:06.550
You are no longer welcome
as my student.

16:13.720 --> 16:15.310
What do you want me to do?

16:15.390 --> 16:17.850
Force Master Pakku to take Aang back

16:17.940 --> 16:18.980
as his student?

16:19.060 --> 16:21.020
Yes. Please.

16:21.110 --> 16:23.900
I suspect he might change his mind

16:23.980 --> 16:27.530
if you swallow your pride
and apologize to him.

16:31.410 --> 16:32.410
Fine.

16:33.160 --> 16:34.910
I'm waiting, little girl.

16:35.830 --> 16:37.000
No!

16:37.080 --> 16:40.540
No way am I apologizing
to a sour old man like you!

16:42.420 --> 16:43.590
AANG: Uh, Katara...

16:43.670 --> 16:45.960
I'll be outside
if you're man enough to fight me.

16:50.680 --> 16:52.350
I'm sure she didn't mean that.

16:52.430 --> 16:54.010
Yeah, I think she did.

16:56.020 --> 16:59.270
I'm devastated
to hear about Prince Zuko.

16:59.480 --> 17:01.360
Just devastated.

17:02.060 --> 17:03.980
The Fire Lord will not be pleased

17:04.190 --> 17:06.780
when he learns who was responsible.

17:06.990 --> 17:09.570
You know who was behind the attack?

17:10.070 --> 17:12.620
Yes. Pirates.

17:13.240 --> 17:15.620
We had a run-in with them
a while back.

17:15.740 --> 17:17.500
They wanted revenge.

17:19.670 --> 17:22.380
So, have you reconsidered my offer?

17:22.880 --> 17:24.550
Yes, I accept.

17:25.090 --> 17:28.090
It will be an honor
to serve as your general.

17:28.920 --> 17:30.510
To the Fire Nation.

17:30.590 --> 17:31.800
To victory!

17:35.470 --> 17:36.770
SOKKA: Are you crazy, Katara?

17:36.850 --> 17:38.730
You're not gonna win this fight.

17:38.930 --> 17:40.600
I know. I don't care.

17:40.690 --> 17:42.310
You don't have to do this for me.

17:42.400 --> 17:43.860
I can find another teacher.

17:43.940 --> 17:45.690
I'm not doing it for you.

17:45.770 --> 17:48.240
Someone needs to
slap some sense into that guy.

17:49.240 --> 17:51.200
So, you decided to show up?

17:54.870 --> 17:55.870
Aren't you gonna fight?

17:56.200 --> 17:57.620
Go back to the healing huts

17:57.700 --> 17:59.410
with the other women,
where you belong.

18:04.000 --> 18:05.170
Fine.

18:05.250 --> 18:06.800
You want to learn to fight so bad,

18:06.880 --> 18:08.300
study closely.

18:18.770 --> 18:20.270
Don't worry.
I'm not going to hurt you.

18:23.900 --> 18:25.190
Ow!

18:39.490 --> 18:41.580
You can't knock me down!

18:41.660 --> 18:43.080
AANG: Go, Katara!

18:43.290 --> 18:44.290
( CHEERING )

18:53.010 --> 18:54.010
( CHEERING )

19:15.610 --> 19:16.620
( PANTING )

19:24.580 --> 19:26.460
Well, I'm impressed.

19:26.540 --> 19:28.960
You are an excellent waterbender.

19:29.040 --> 19:31.130
But you still won't teach me,
will you?

19:31.210 --> 19:32.460
No.

19:43.310 --> 19:44.480
( PANTING )

19:57.200 --> 19:58.870
This fight is over.

19:59.240 --> 20:01.410
Come back here. I'm not finished yet.

20:01.490 --> 20:03.250
Yes. You are.

20:05.580 --> 20:08.170
This is my necklace.

20:08.330 --> 20:10.960
No, it's not. It's mine. Give it back!

20:11.040 --> 20:13.510
I made this 60 years ago...

20:13.710 --> 20:16.220
For the love of my life...

20:16.430 --> 20:17.550
For Kanna.

20:18.010 --> 20:20.640
My gran-gran
was supposed to marry you?

20:26.520 --> 20:28.770
Our plan is working perfectly.

20:28.980 --> 20:31.230
Zhao doesn't suspect a thing.

20:32.190 --> 20:33.650
You didn't have to do this.

20:33.900 --> 20:37.200
No nephew of mine
is going to stow away on a ship

20:37.280 --> 20:38.530
without some backup.

20:38.740 --> 20:39.870
Thank you, Uncle.

20:39.950 --> 20:41.030
( DOOR OPENS )

20:41.120 --> 20:42.580
Someone's coming.

20:43.030 --> 20:45.620
Stay hidden
until we get to the North Pole

20:45.700 --> 20:47.960
and the Avatar will be yours.

20:48.040 --> 20:49.460
Good luck.

20:52.340 --> 20:54.380
I carved this necklace
for your grandmother

20:54.460 --> 20:56.380
when we got engaged.

20:56.470 --> 21:00.180
I thought we would have
a long happy life together.

21:00.260 --> 21:01.680
I loved her.

21:01.760 --> 21:03.680
But she didn't love you, did she?

21:03.810 --> 21:05.600
It was an arranged marriage.

21:06.850 --> 21:10.650
Gran-gran wouldn't let your tribe's
stupid customs run her life.

21:10.850 --> 21:12.400
That's why she left.

21:12.610 --> 21:14.520
It must have taken a lot of courage.

21:14.980 --> 21:17.030
( SOBBING )

21:17.110 --> 21:18.240
Go get her.

21:25.950 --> 21:27.500
What do you want from me?

21:27.830 --> 21:28.870
Nothing.

21:28.960 --> 21:31.880
I just want you to know
I think you're beautiful.

21:31.960 --> 21:34.960
And I never thought a girl like you
would even notice a guy like me.

21:35.050 --> 21:36.550
You don't understand.

21:36.760 --> 21:37.880
No, no.

21:37.960 --> 21:39.380
See, that's the thing.

21:39.470 --> 21:41.090
I think I do understand now.

21:41.300 --> 21:43.680
You're a princess, and I'm...

21:43.760 --> 21:45.260
I'm just a southern peasant.

21:45.470 --> 21:47.020
No, Sokka.

21:47.220 --> 21:48.350
It's ok.

21:48.430 --> 21:49.810
You don't have to say anything.

21:50.560 --> 21:51.690
I'll see you around, ok.

21:55.480 --> 21:58.320
Ok, now I'm really confused!

21:58.530 --> 22:01.200
Happy, but confused.

22:01.280 --> 22:03.740
I do like you... A lot!

22:03.820 --> 22:05.530
But we can't be together.

22:05.620 --> 22:07.700
And not for the reason you think.

22:08.290 --> 22:10.250
It's because...

22:10.330 --> 22:11.960
I'm engaged.

22:13.670 --> 22:15.130
I'm sorry.

22:25.510 --> 22:27.260
Not bad. Not bad.

22:27.350 --> 22:28.430
Ha ha ha ha.

22:28.520 --> 22:30.060
Keep practicing,
and maybe you'll get it

22:30.140 --> 22:31.980
by the time you're my age.

22:33.060 --> 22:34.060
( PANTING )

22:34.400 --> 22:35.690
Hey, Katara.

22:35.770 --> 22:37.150
What do you think you're doing?

22:37.730 --> 22:39.400
It's past sunrise.

22:39.480 --> 22:41.030
You're late.

22:41.780 --> 22:43.030
Good to see you here.

22:43.150 --> 22:44.280
You, too.

22:52.620 --> 22:54.540
My fleet is ready.

22:54.790 --> 22:57.590
Set a course
for the Northern Water Tribe.
