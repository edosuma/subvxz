WEBVTT

00:43.126 --> 00:44.502
Chaos Emerald.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.589
There you are.

00:47.672 --> 00:50.008
Chaos Control!

01:25.001 --> 01:26.336
Sonic.

01:59.869 --> 02:01.830
<i>So, I know what you're thinking.</i>

02:01.913 --> 02:03.665
<i>"Sonic has a twin brother?"</i>

02:03.748 --> 02:05.500
<i>Well, no.</i>

02:05.583 --> 02:07.168
<i>This guy right here is Shadow,</i>

02:07.252 --> 02:09.003
<i>and he's kinda my biggest rival.</i>

02:09.087 --> 02:10.630
<i>He's also a real buzz-kill.</i>

02:10.713 --> 02:13.424
<i>And by the way, he roller-skates!</i>

02:13.508 --> 02:15.343
They're air shoes.

02:17.595 --> 02:20.431
-Shadow?!
-What did you do?

02:20.515 --> 02:23.476
What did <i>I </i>do?
Eggman's the bad guy, remember?

02:23.560 --> 02:25.520
You literally shook the world.

02:25.603 --> 02:28.189
That's 'cause I'm good.

02:28.273 --> 02:30.483
And powerful, apparently. Jealous?

02:34.737 --> 02:36.823
Maybe my winning disrupted your brooding?

02:36.906 --> 02:39.450
Or is it skulking? That's a word, right?

02:40.451 --> 02:43.413
You need to stop, Sonic,
and listen for once!

02:52.797 --> 02:55.550
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

03:19.198 --> 03:20.950
I could do this all day!

03:29.167 --> 03:31.210
Whoa!

03:37.967 --> 03:41.471
Clearly you're angry, which is normal.

03:42.680 --> 03:44.098
But I'm supposed to be on a bit

03:44.182 --> 03:45.850
of a mission here, Shadow!

03:45.934 --> 03:47.143
What mission?

03:47.227 --> 03:48.603
None of your business.

04:18.132 --> 04:20.134
I know, we're fighting again.

04:20.218 --> 04:22.428
Don't worry, guys, I'll calm him down.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.515
Dude, whatever the beef,

04:25.598 --> 04:27.809
we're not gonna settle it this way.

04:52.667 --> 04:55.044
Oh, no! My friends!

04:55.128 --> 04:57.588
Look, Shadow, I'm late--

04:57.672 --> 04:59.924
-Learn to focus.

05:00.008 --> 05:02.885
<i>I can't remember a thing</i>
<i>after that punch.</i>

05:02.969 --> 05:04.846
<i>Attention, denizens.</i>

05:04.929 --> 05:06.973
<i>Be a good egg.</i>

05:07.056 --> 05:09.100
<i>Obey the Council.</i>

05:09.183 --> 05:12.395
<i>Everyone must move in an orderly fashion.</i>

05:12.478 --> 05:15.523
<i>Keep a single-file line when moving</i>

05:15.606 --> 05:17.317
<i>to your next destination.</i>

05:17.400 --> 05:20.820
<i>Any information you have</i>
<i>about the blue hedgehog,</i>

05:20.903 --> 05:22.739
<i>come forward.</i>

05:22.822 --> 05:25.658
<i>Smog,</i>
<i>concrete, evil robots...</i>

05:25.742 --> 05:26.951
<i>-It's like everything I...</i>
-<i>Love.</i>

05:27.035 --> 05:28.995
<i>...all in one place!</i>

05:32.915 --> 05:34.792
<i>Think egg thoughts.</i>

05:34.876 --> 05:40.631
<i>Dream only egg thoughts. Egg is perfect.</i>

05:48.848 --> 05:50.808
Are you sure we were best friends?

05:52.477 --> 05:54.395
The blue streak has a friend?

05:54.479 --> 05:56.064
Didn't look friendly.

05:56.147 --> 05:58.316
But whoever he is, he's involved now.

06:00.068 --> 06:02.820
<i>Hey, boss! You gotta get back to HQ now.</i>

06:02.904 --> 06:05.073
<i>There's something you gotta see.</i>

06:28.137 --> 06:30.848
Rebel Rouge, Renegade Knucks,
right over here.

06:35.561 --> 06:38.648
<i>Snap out of it! We go way back!</i>

06:38.731 --> 06:40.274
<i>Don't you wanna go home?</i>

06:40.358 --> 06:44.654
<i>Blue skies? Sunny beaches? Palm trees?</i>

06:44.737 --> 06:46.864
Did he just say...?

07:02.088 --> 07:03.840
Huh? Whoa!

07:09.971 --> 07:11.180
Huh?

07:39.834 --> 07:44.255
Get away!
Stop destroying our forest!

08:01.689 --> 08:02.899
It's gone.

08:02.982 --> 08:04.609
All of it.

08:05.026 --> 08:06.694
We'll get it back.

08:06.777 --> 08:10.364
How? It's... it's hopeless.

08:16.913 --> 08:20.291
The blue guy is obviously an enemy
of the Council too.

08:20.374 --> 08:24.003
He's strong, fast, and he knows

08:24.086 --> 08:25.505
we can make a better world.

08:27.798 --> 08:28.966
That's hope.

08:30.718 --> 08:32.929
Let's get 'em out.

08:42.396 --> 08:44.690
Those in favor of stress-testing

08:44.774 --> 08:46.734
this blue rabbit, say yes!

08:46.817 --> 08:48.569
Oh, yes, please!

08:48.653 --> 08:52.156
Let's see how powerful he is.

09:22.436 --> 09:24.939
<i>Interrogation protocol engaged.</i>

09:25.022 --> 09:29.443
<i>Denizen 1-9-9-8, you were seen</i>
<i>with the blue hedgehog.</i>

09:29.527 --> 09:31.445
<i>Explain yourself.</i>

09:40.580 --> 09:41.998
There's a small chance we can get in

09:42.081 --> 09:43.874
through the ventilation system.

09:43.958 --> 09:46.210
-How small?
-You don't wanna know.

09:46.294 --> 09:48.838
First, we have to get through
the fortress firewall.

09:48.921 --> 09:50.631
If we set off its sensors,

09:50.715 --> 09:53.801
the guards will be on us
like Mr. Doctor's bad toupee.

09:53.884 --> 09:57.638
They probably have the hedgehog
up there... in their lab.

09:57.722 --> 10:00.224
All right, stealth it is.

10:00.308 --> 10:01.934
What? I stealth!

10:02.018 --> 10:03.644
Stealth is not your thing.

10:03.728 --> 10:05.980
But it's adorable you're willing to try.

10:06.063 --> 10:07.732
"Adorable"?!

10:07.815 --> 10:10.234
If it makes you feel better,
before we can stealth properly,

10:10.318 --> 10:12.361
we need a diversion.

10:27.668 --> 10:32.590
Oh, I knew it! He's got
the same energy that powers the city.

10:46.604 --> 10:48.147
Sonic, it's broken!

10:48.230 --> 10:50.399
-It's all broken.
-Shadow?

10:50.483 --> 10:53.569
Uh-oh, I think I'm starting
to hallucinate!

11:24.392 --> 11:27.478
How's that for a diversion?

11:32.608 --> 11:35.403
The power just went out.

11:52.128 --> 11:54.713
This has literally never happened.

11:56.257 --> 11:58.342
Is this what luck feels like?

11:58.426 --> 12:01.178
Feels more like a trap to me.

12:01.262 --> 12:02.596
I don't know.

12:02.680 --> 12:04.348
First, the blue hedgehog shows up,

12:04.432 --> 12:07.226
and now New Yoke City loses its power.

12:07.309 --> 12:09.270
Ah, maybe you're right,

12:09.353 --> 12:11.939
but it feels like a <i>trap!</i>

12:54.773 --> 12:58.903
<i>Denizens, order!</i>
<i>Return to formation!</i>

13:00.070 --> 13:02.156
If it happened once,
it could happen again!

13:02.239 --> 13:04.033
We gotta join the resistance!

13:05.367 --> 13:08.412
My toupee! My toupee!

13:10.164 --> 13:14.710
Ah, so help me... I tell ya what, I...

13:16.879 --> 13:20.132
Ugh! I almost had the high score!

13:28.182 --> 13:30.684
Paradox prism.

13:32.061 --> 13:33.229
Sonic, wait!

13:36.482 --> 13:38.275
Shadow?

13:52.164 --> 13:55.334
So, what do I get
for passing the test?

13:56.418 --> 13:58.170
Did this blue rat

13:58.254 --> 14:00.589
figure out a way
to steal our power supply?

14:01.840 --> 14:03.342
Correction, Your Eminence.

14:03.425 --> 14:06.345
He did not draw on the city's power, but--

14:06.428 --> 14:07.846
He brought his own.

14:07.930 --> 14:10.641
What?! What do you mean,
he brought his own?

14:10.724 --> 14:12.851
How does a hedgehog walk in here

14:12.935 --> 14:15.229
with the same power supply as our battery?

14:21.318 --> 14:23.112
Incredible!

14:23.195 --> 14:25.865
Our crystal plus his energy charge

14:25.948 --> 14:27.491
would give us enough power

14:27.575 --> 14:29.535
to finally stamp out the resistance

14:29.618 --> 14:33.247
and put an end
to those pesky rebels forever!

14:38.377 --> 14:42.673
Uh, really? Don't you think
that's a little excessive?

14:43.924 --> 14:45.092
You heard the baby.

14:45.175 --> 14:47.303
Energy extractor.

15:05.154 --> 15:08.574
Anyone else having bad dentist flashbacks?

15:08.657 --> 15:10.284
Cut out the prismatic energy

15:10.367 --> 15:12.620
he's got inside that prickly hide of his!

15:12.703 --> 15:16.206
Wait! Can a hedgehog say his last words?

15:17.917 --> 15:19.627
Fine! But be brief!

15:19.710 --> 15:22.504
Well... uh...

15:23.881 --> 15:26.967
Hey, hedgehog! Get on with it!

15:27.051 --> 15:28.552
Right.

15:28.636 --> 15:33.891
I just wanna say that this life of mine
has been a wild ride.

15:33.974 --> 15:37.436
Who would've imagined the places I'd go

15:37.519 --> 15:40.397
or the chili dogs I'd eat
when I got there.

15:42.483 --> 15:45.903
Uh, I'm here.
I'm... I'm listening.

15:45.986 --> 15:48.280
But at the end of the day,

15:48.364 --> 15:53.160
it's not about the ups or the downs
or the zigs or the zags.

15:53.243 --> 15:56.580
It's about the friends we made
along the way.

15:59.625 --> 16:01.001
Sonic, wait!

16:02.503 --> 16:05.589
Huh? Uh...

16:07.007 --> 16:08.926
Enough with the winking already!

16:09.009 --> 16:11.345
I'm almost done, I'm almost done.

16:11.428 --> 16:14.181
Where was I? Uh... uh... um...

16:14.264 --> 16:15.933
-Oh, boy.

16:16.016 --> 16:19.979
Ah, friends! Right!
All right, let's see, um...

16:20.062 --> 16:22.398
Froggy and Big.

16:22.481 --> 16:26.068
Ah, always there
when I needed a pick-me-up.

16:26.151 --> 16:29.822
Rouge! Oh, Rouge
with her... with her heart of gold

16:29.905 --> 16:31.490
hidden beneath her wings.

16:31.573 --> 16:34.952
And, uh, and Knuckles with his...

16:35.035 --> 16:36.370
knuckles!

16:36.453 --> 16:39.873
I would also like to thank Amy.

16:39.957 --> 16:43.002
Thanking? Does he think
he's winning an award?

16:45.337 --> 16:47.631
Babbles is right. It's almost dinnertime.

16:47.715 --> 16:48.924
Finish him!

16:49.008 --> 16:53.012
Oh, already? But I'm not done.

16:53.095 --> 16:56.390
Hey, Sir Winks-A-Lot,
there is a plan, right?

16:56.473 --> 16:57.725
Right?

16:57.808 --> 17:01.353
Nope, sorry. Just dust in my eye.

17:01.437 --> 17:04.773
Looks like this is game over.

17:14.950 --> 17:15.951
See ya, buddy.

17:25.586 --> 17:28.464
I'm alive! I'm alive!

17:29.548 --> 17:30.966
Get her!

17:38.307 --> 17:39.975
So, we done stealthing?

17:40.059 --> 17:41.727
One hundred percent.

17:46.607 --> 17:49.318
What's going on? I can't see.

17:49.401 --> 17:50.402
Wait, wait...

17:52.446 --> 17:53.530
Wait!

17:57.701 --> 18:00.537
Filthy rebels. Destroy them!

18:14.301 --> 18:16.804
Egg-forcers, secure all targets.

18:34.822 --> 18:36.865
Whoa!

18:47.626 --> 18:49.628
Okay, hedgehog, you're up.

18:49.711 --> 18:53.924
A bit woozy
from all the lab testing.

18:55.384 --> 18:57.136
Rouge? Knuckles?

18:57.219 --> 18:58.762
How do you know our names?

19:07.396 --> 19:08.397
Rebel!

19:12.025 --> 19:13.569
Oh, come on, Amy.

19:13.652 --> 19:16.155
Why you gotta hate on 'em like that?

19:20.409 --> 19:22.995
Man, why is the room still spinning?

19:32.254 --> 19:33.964
Whoa!

19:38.802 --> 19:41.013
Ugh, feels like their luck ran out.

19:47.394 --> 19:48.437
Or maybe not.

20:16.757 --> 20:18.133
<i>Access denied.</i>

20:29.686 --> 20:31.605
<i>-Uh-uh-uh.</i>

20:40.113 --> 20:43.992
No. Catch up, Echidna.
I'm one of the good guys.

20:48.330 --> 20:49.706
<i>Ha, ha, loser!</i>

21:01.635 --> 21:04.137
-Blue hedgehog, terminate.
