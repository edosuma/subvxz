00:39.272 --> 00:40.899
<i>The Zenith Team.</i>

00:42.242 --> 00:46.042
<i>Five young superheroes</i>
<i>who fought to protect the world from evil.</i>

01:02.862 --> 01:05.660
<i>Led by Captain Zoom</i>
<i>and his brother Concussion,</i>

01:07.300 --> 01:09.234
<i>the team saved many lives.</i>

01:11.504 --> 01:13.472
<i>Team Zenith.</i>

01:16.543 --> 01:19.603
<i>Oh, and with the help of their sidekick,</i>
<i>Dr. Grant.</i>

01:20.980 --> 01:23.414
<i>The government sought to enhance</i>
<i>the team's powers</i>

01:23.483 --> 01:25.610
<i>using Gamma-13 radiation.</i>

01:28.488 --> 01:31.150
<i>Zoom got faster and stronger,</i>

01:33.026 --> 01:36.052
<i>but the Gamma turned Concussion</i>
<i>to the dark side.</i>

01:37.297 --> 01:39.458
<i>He turned on his own team.</i>

01:46.706 --> 01:48.367
<i>Zoom lost his powers</i>

01:49.375 --> 01:50.569
<i>and his brother.</i>

02:08.761 --> 02:12.026
<i>We're coming up now.</i>
<i>Prepare to deactivate cloaking device.</i>

02:20.406 --> 02:24.172
I told you not to call me
unless the world was going to end.

02:24.277 --> 02:25.835
I don't know about the world ending,

02:25.912 --> 02:28.142
but we've been tracking
a pan-dimensional anomaly

02:28.214 --> 02:31.012
that seems to be moving toward
our time-space continuum.

02:31.084 --> 02:34.076
Dr. Grant, I speak Greek, not geek.

02:34.521 --> 02:35.886
Let me put it this way.

02:35.955 --> 02:38.549
Concussion is still alive,
and he's coming back.

02:38.625 --> 02:40.217
He was destroyed.

02:41.561 --> 02:44.291
- Nope.
- We were there. We both saw it.

02:45.565 --> 02:46.554
Nope.

02:48.234 --> 02:50.361
<i>Twelve days and counting.</i>

02:50.737 --> 02:52.136
The time has come.

02:53.673 --> 02:56.039
I'm reactivating the Zenith Program.

02:56.442 --> 02:59.934
Find me some kids.
Misfits, outcasts, weirdos.

03:00.480 --> 03:01.879
Give me that file.

03:05.351 --> 03:07.717
Zoom's the only one who can train them.

03:07.787 --> 03:09.015
Now, get to Long Beach,

03:09.088 --> 03:12.546
find him, evaluate his condition,
and bring him back here.

03:15.895 --> 03:17.624
You know he won't cooperate.

03:17.697 --> 03:20.860
You won the Nobel Prize, Doctor.
You'll think of something.

03:56.869 --> 03:58.769
<i>Okay, he's looking. Come now.</i>

04:01.841 --> 04:03.638
There's a car coming, lady.

04:05.311 --> 04:06.573
Hey, look out.

04:10.750 --> 04:13.310
Yeah, you're sure you're okay, huh?

04:13.486 --> 04:16.046
- That guy almost killed me.
- Watch out for the

04:16.122 --> 04:17.180
grease.

04:18.625 --> 04:20.422
Should have told you
about those grease spots.

04:20.493 --> 04:22.051
Come on, get up.

04:23.529 --> 04:24.518
Grant?

04:24.797 --> 04:26.856
- Hello, Zoom.
- It's Jack.

04:28.167 --> 04:30.158
Okay, Jack.

04:31.337 --> 04:32.861
It's good to see you.

04:33.172 --> 04:35.003
Wow. You got old.

04:37.877 --> 04:39.902
It's been, what, 30 years?

04:40.079 --> 04:43.537
- What are you doing here, Grant?
- We're starting up a new team.

04:43.750 --> 04:45.479
Men's slow-pitch softball?

04:48.421 --> 04:50.116
No, a new Zenith team.

04:51.024 --> 04:53.652
- You can't be serious.
- We are serious, Mr. Shepard.

04:53.726 --> 04:56.422
- Why is the green dress talking?
- I'm a psychologist.

04:56.496 --> 04:59.124
I'm sorry. This is Miss Holloway.
She works with me.

04:59.198 --> 05:00.995
Yes, and despite the theatrics,

05:01.067 --> 05:03.228
which were not my idea, by the way,

05:03.970 --> 05:05.369
you're the only one who can help us.

05:05.438 --> 05:07.429
You're the only superhero left.

05:08.675 --> 05:10.836
Somebody's been giving you
the wrong information.

05:10.910 --> 05:13.071
So, if you'll excuse me, I got work to do.

05:13.146 --> 05:15.512
We're here to take you back,
not to invite you back.

05:15.581 --> 05:18.550
And we're authorized to use
whatever means necessary.

05:18.785 --> 05:21.083
- Grant, Grant, Grant.
- You can't shoot him.

05:22.689 --> 05:24.247
- Nice.
- Sorry.

05:35.268 --> 05:36.565
Trick or treat.

05:37.036 --> 05:38.560
Here you go, sweetie.

05:40.907 --> 05:42.238
Trick or treat.

05:47.547 --> 05:49.174
- Thank you.
- Thanks a lot.

05:49.248 --> 05:51.409
- Give it here, Howdy Doo-Doo.
- Bully.

06:01.828 --> 06:02.954
Oh, my gosh.

06:06.065 --> 06:07.225
Thank you.

06:11.170 --> 06:12.569
I'll take that.

06:13.673 --> 06:15.106
She's so weird.

06:15.908 --> 06:17.034
Freak.

06:18.211 --> 06:19.371
That was a good one.

06:37.630 --> 06:38.961
Oh, my gosh.

06:39.132 --> 06:40.599
What just happened?

06:40.666 --> 06:42.258
How does my hair look?

06:51.244 --> 06:52.336
Dylan.

06:53.980 --> 06:57.245
Perhaps you'd like to come up
and finish Newton's equation?

06:57.650 --> 07:00.175
I think Newton can finish his own equation.

07:01.821 --> 07:02.981
Now, Dylan.

07:53.272 --> 07:54.569
Yes.

08:08.721 --> 08:11.986
Check it out.
Lard-butt's going to snap the board in half.

08:46.792 --> 08:48.259
Wake up, Zoom.

08:48.327 --> 08:51.763
Zoom? Welcome back to Area 52.

08:54.867 --> 08:56.835
Thank you, Grant, for bringing me
back to a place

08:56.903 --> 08:58.871
I've been avoiding for the last 30 years.

08:59.038 --> 09:01.438
You have two choices as I understand it.

09:01.774 --> 09:03.742
One is to stay here

09:03.809 --> 09:06.300
and the other is to go directly to prison.

09:06.479 --> 09:07.946
How long in prison?

09:08.114 --> 09:11.606
We are also very happy to pay you $500,000.

09:12.985 --> 09:16.921
You know you could've just said that
instead of shooting me with a dart.

09:18.891 --> 09:19.915
Yes.

09:20.059 --> 09:21.219
Mr. Shepard.

09:21.594 --> 09:25.325
Mr. Shepard, I can't tell you how happy I am
that you've come aboard.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.729
It's you.

09:29.702 --> 09:31.431
Do you have an inner-ear problem
or something?

09:31.504 --> 09:32.835
- Zoom...
- Jack.

09:33.239 --> 09:34.365
Right, Jack.

09:34.440 --> 09:38.308
Miss Holloway is our leading researcher
in the area of latent superhuman abilities.

09:38.377 --> 09:40.538
She'll be in charge of
training the new Zenith team.

09:40.613 --> 09:42.638
She's also quite a fan of yours.

09:43.816 --> 09:47.047
I have every issue of
<i>Captain Zoom And His Amazing Team,</i>

09:47.153 --> 09:49.417
most of them
still in their original plastic sleeves.

09:49.488 --> 09:51.479
That's creepy.
But do you still have that green dress?

09:51.557 --> 09:53.821
I even have the
fifth anniversary double issue,

09:53.893 --> 09:55.588
<i>Zoom Vs. The Atomic Melt.</i>

09:55.661 --> 10:00.530
I have it in Japanese, German,
Farsi, Hindi and Braille.

10:00.800 --> 10:03.325
How about that green dress? Still have that?

10:09.575 --> 10:12.271
Ladies and gentlemen,
may I have your attention, please?

10:12.345 --> 10:14.279
The return of Zoom.

10:17.717 --> 10:21.483
Show of hands, who here does not live
with their mom in her basement?

10:28.094 --> 10:30.927
We have assembled a group
of 10 special candidates.

10:31.097 --> 10:33.691
The extent of their abilities is still unknown,

10:33.766 --> 10:35.529
like it was when your team arrived.

10:35.601 --> 10:37.899
We wanted your help
in choosing the ones with the best potential

10:37.970 --> 10:39.062
for a new Zenith team.

10:39.138 --> 10:41.572
Well, for half a million dollars
in cash and prizes

10:41.641 --> 10:44.166
let's take a look at those contestants,
shall we?

10:54.353 --> 10:56.184
What, are we forming a spelling bee?

10:56.255 --> 10:58.655
I assure you, they are all quite gifted.

10:58.724 --> 11:00.692
Gifted what? They're a bunch of kids.

11:00.760 --> 11:03.854
And what power do they have? I haven't
read or heard about a Gamma event.

11:03.929 --> 11:04.918
Well, there weren't any.

11:04.997 --> 11:07.295
My studies in meta-human
psychophysiology

11:07.366 --> 11:09.231
have made Gamma treatments obsolete.

11:09.301 --> 11:12.065
I am quite confident
that we can develop their abilities

11:12.138 --> 11:14.902
far beyond what was achieved
during the Gamma-13 days.

11:14.974 --> 11:16.874
And we can do it safely

11:17.376 --> 11:18.638
and naturally.

11:19.979 --> 11:21.947
I'm sorry, I must've dozed off there
for a minute.

11:22.014 --> 11:23.743
Times have changed, Zoom.

11:25.584 --> 11:28.815
Well, they'd better be able to do
some mind-blowing stuff.

11:36.929 --> 11:39.056
What is this? She's blinking fast.

11:39.231 --> 11:42.291
- She was better in the audition.
- I am a little cooler.

11:47.740 --> 11:48.729
Oh, dude.

11:54.146 --> 11:56.114
Now you see him, now you don't.

11:56.449 --> 11:57.711
How you doing?

12:11.897 --> 12:14.195
Pass the hand sanitizer, please.

12:17.136 --> 12:22.233
A-B-C-D-E-F-G-H-I-J-K-L-M-N-O-P...

12:22.308 --> 12:23.639
Stop that.

12:24.343 --> 12:27.073
You're singing the alphabet.
That's not a power.

12:27.146 --> 12:29.114
And your voice is average, it's not super.

12:29.181 --> 12:30.705
It is, too, super.

12:40.559 --> 12:43.187
Get another table in here, please.
Right away.

12:54.006 --> 12:55.268
I see things.

12:55.474 --> 12:57.101
Do you see dead people?

12:57.276 --> 13:00.609
I see that you suffer
from a massive inferiority complex.

13:01.714 --> 13:03.648
I try to hide that so well.

13:06.852 --> 13:08.820
I'm Jupiter the Gas Giant.

13:11.257 --> 13:12.986
- Say, "Excuse me."
- Yikes.

13:18.664 --> 13:21.565
Is he doing it,
or is he just naturally that chubby?

13:38.150 --> 13:39.481
It's so cool.

14:01.574 --> 14:02.734
Miss Holloway,

14:02.808 --> 14:05.436
how would you like to introduce
our trainees to their new instructor?

14:05.511 --> 14:07.308
I would love to. You ready?

14:07.513 --> 14:09.538
- Yeah. I can't wait.
- Okay.

14:14.587 --> 14:16.350
That is getting so old.

14:16.422 --> 14:19.289
Well, considering you can read my mind,
I don't have many options.

14:19.358 --> 14:21.826
I can't read your mind. I just feel stuff.

14:22.261 --> 14:24.752
And you could stop hitting on me entirely.

14:24.964 --> 14:27.228
No, I can't do that.

14:27.967 --> 14:29.559
You and I are destiny.

14:31.570 --> 14:35.529
Children, I would like to formally
introduce you to a very great man,

14:35.808 --> 14:37.173
Mr. Jack Shepard.

14:41.947 --> 14:44.142
Sorry. I don't remember eating that.

14:45.584 --> 14:47.484
Great man or washed-up loser?

14:49.488 --> 14:51.786
It's a fine line. What a nice kid.

14:51.857 --> 14:55.452
Is the long hair and the James Dean angst
just a package with you?

14:55.527 --> 14:58.860
Mr. Shepard is uniquely qualified
to be your new instructor.

14:59.398 --> 15:01.389
And now he'll tell you why.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.163
What?

15:03.302 --> 15:04.735
Oh, yeah, kids,

15:05.471 --> 15:07.598
do you have any idea
what you're doing here or why?

15:07.673 --> 15:08.901
Me.

15:10.609 --> 15:12.543
Come on. Come on. Me, me, me.

15:16.115 --> 15:17.173
Me.

15:17.249 --> 15:20.275
- All right, the little one.
- We were brought here in super secret

15:20.352 --> 15:23.253
because we were selected
out of a huge group of kids

15:23.322 --> 15:24.619
because we're really special

15:24.690 --> 15:27.523
and they needed special kids
for a special course.

15:27.793 --> 15:29.784
That's what Miss Holloway said.

15:31.297 --> 15:34.232
I don't think I've ever heard anybody
use that many "specials" in a sentence.

15:34.300 --> 15:38.202
She actually worked it in there
one more time than Collins did.

15:38.404 --> 15:40.998
But it's all a lie.
We're here because we're different.

15:41.073 --> 15:42.802
- We're not different.
- Come on. Chill out.

15:42.875 --> 15:45.400
You can pick up a car, and you're six.
How different does it get?

15:45.477 --> 15:47.877
- Don't tell her that.
- Don't be a jerk, man.

15:47.947 --> 15:50.643
- What? Tucker, I'm not being a jerk.
- Children.

15:54.453 --> 15:56.546
- Sorry.
- Okay, maybe this'll help.

15:56.722 --> 15:59.953
I spent a lot of time here at Camp Secret

16:00.559 --> 16:03.756
when I was just about your age.
And you know what?

16:03.896 --> 16:05.420
It pretty much

16:05.564 --> 16:07.429
- ruined my life.
- Mr. Shepard.

16:07.499 --> 16:10.593
Hey, the military would like you to be
just like me.

16:10.669 --> 16:13.103
You have to work hard and focus.

16:13.739 --> 16:15.400
But most of all, most important,

16:15.474 --> 16:19.137
you're going to need
massive doses of Gamma-13 emissions.

16:19.311 --> 16:23.008
So let's wheel in that big machine
and zap the little guys, huh?

16:23.082 --> 16:26.813
- That's not true. Mr. Shepard. Hallway.
- Right. Let's go to the hallway.

16:26.885 --> 16:31.151
You guys want to slip into that lead
underwear, you wanna protect your privates.

16:32.057 --> 16:33.957
Always the smart aleck.

16:34.159 --> 16:36.753
But he is definitely the target, sir.

16:36.996 --> 16:40.625
The center of the dimensional probing
is following Zoom here, from Long Beach.

16:40.699 --> 16:44.066
We've finally found something
that Shepard excels at.

16:44.536 --> 16:46.060
Being the bait.

16:46.171 --> 16:48.196
If you can't get those kids
combat-ready in time,

16:48.273 --> 16:53.472
I'll have to dose them with enough
Gamma-13 to sterilize a trailer park.

16:54.179 --> 16:56.807
And if that should happen,
you can rest assured, sir,

16:56.882 --> 17:01.114
that I will do everything in my power
to make sure it's not my fault.

17:03.088 --> 17:05.613
I told you.
We will not be dosing the children.

17:05.691 --> 17:09.684
Based on what we have in there, I think
you might want to dose them just a little.

17:09.762 --> 17:13.129
Come on. Drop them by a nuclear facility
and leave them there.

17:13.198 --> 17:15.996
Or drop them off at the dentist and
have them x-rayed 200 or 300 times.

17:16.068 --> 17:17.899
I don't think you understand
their sensitive condition.

17:17.970 --> 17:19.801
What about my sensitive condition?

17:19.872 --> 17:22.807
I'm being asked
to betray children for money.

17:25.544 --> 17:27.136
- Are you done?
- I left a little pause there

17:27.212 --> 17:30.010
in case you wanted to slip and fall again.

17:34.653 --> 17:36.587
Grant, what am I doing here?

17:36.655 --> 17:39.180
- Come on.
- Let me show you something.

17:43.262 --> 17:44.388
Wow.

17:44.830 --> 17:46.821
I made that suit for you.

17:48.267 --> 17:51.100
Too bad you never got a chance to wear it.

17:52.638 --> 17:54.936
- Welcome back, Zoom.
- It's Jack.

17:55.507 --> 17:56.838
It's Zoom.

17:58.077 --> 17:59.135
Wow.

17:59.845 --> 18:02.040
Where'd you put... Is this...

18:08.821 --> 18:10.015
Cool. Zoom comics.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.421
Tucker, wait. Do not touch this.

18:13.192 --> 18:16.286
This is a first edition.
Don't even touch the sleeve.

18:16.361 --> 18:20.593
Now, everyone, please put on your
pH-balancing, antibacterial gloves.

18:24.303 --> 18:25.497
Or not.

18:25.838 --> 18:27.362
Why are you giving us these?

18:27.439 --> 18:29.066
Well, I'm not giving them to you,

18:29.141 --> 18:30.836
but I'm showing them to you

18:30.909 --> 18:34.709
because yesterday you asked me
why Mr. Shepard was a great man.

18:34.780 --> 18:35.872
Well,

18:36.648 --> 18:38.172
this is why he's a great man.

18:38.250 --> 18:40.480
Because he collects comic books?

18:40.552 --> 18:43.885
No. Because he is the comic book.

18:44.523 --> 18:47.117
Mr. Shepard is Captain Zoom.

18:47.526 --> 18:50.188
And these comics are a record

18:50.696 --> 18:54.962
of the incredible things that Zoom and
his amazing team did to protect mankind.

18:55.434 --> 18:57.402
He was the leader of the Zenith team

18:57.469 --> 19:01.303
faster than Quicksilver, the Flash
and Superman all together.

19:01.640 --> 19:02.834
No way.

19:03.675 --> 19:04.733
Way.

19:07.012 --> 19:08.274
Zoom.

19:08.347 --> 19:09.746
You're Captain Zoom.

19:09.815 --> 19:12.909
- Can you eat fast, too?
- Zoom. Do something fast.

19:12.985 --> 19:15.681
Well, I guess the cat's out of the bag, huh?

19:15.754 --> 19:17.688
You don't look like a superhero.

19:17.756 --> 19:20.247
I don't? Are you sure?

19:22.828 --> 19:24.295
You know why?

19:24.997 --> 19:26.328
Because I'm not a superhero.

19:26.398 --> 19:28.195
There's no such thing as superheroes.

19:28.267 --> 19:32.203
No matter what people told you around here,
you're not superheroes.

19:32.271 --> 19:34.136
We're superheroes?

19:34.540 --> 19:35.939
Awesome.

19:36.875 --> 19:37.967
Yes.

19:38.043 --> 19:40.841
You're definitely white kids, I'll tell you that.

19:43.015 --> 19:46.576
- Yeah. What?
- Do we get names? And costumes?

19:47.252 --> 19:50.710
- I'm sorry, what's your name again?
- Cindy Collins, age six.

19:50.789 --> 19:53.815
Cindy Collins, age six. This isn't a parade.

19:54.259 --> 19:57.251
Or a Girl Scout jamboree or some sleepover.

19:57.329 --> 19:58.887
It's a military installation.

19:58.964 --> 20:01.489
You get military stuff. Functional ware.

20:01.567 --> 20:05.128
You see this? I used to be able
to move my entire body that fast.

20:05.370 --> 20:07.338
So they put me
in a polycarbonate silicone suit.

20:07.406 --> 20:09.931
That way I didn't vibrate out of my clothes.

20:10.008 --> 20:11.805
You've got to stop doing that.

20:11.877 --> 20:14.277
Can my superhero costume be a tutu?

20:14.346 --> 20:15.745
Are you even trying to listen to me?

20:15.814 --> 20:17.042
So what are they going to make us do?

20:17.115 --> 20:20.050
I don't know, dude.
Let me think about that for just a minute.

20:20.118 --> 20:22.746
And you're supposed to be training us.

20:23.789 --> 20:27.088
Give me a break.
You can barely tie your shoes.

20:27.392 --> 20:30.452
Come on, let's let Mr. Zoom
finish his oatmeal.

20:31.663 --> 20:33.688
It's Cream of Wheat, dude.

20:36.235 --> 20:39.170
It's remarkable. 2.5 tons per arm.

20:41.206 --> 20:42.798
Wow, you shaved.

20:43.308 --> 20:45.003
Wow, you noticed.

20:45.811 --> 20:49.247
Would you believe that little girl
is holding 5 tons above her head?

20:49.314 --> 20:51.680
- Look at that.
- Wait.

20:51.750 --> 20:52.944
<i>Cindy, what are you wearing?</i>

20:53.018 --> 20:54.645
It's my alter eggo.

20:54.720 --> 20:55.982
<i>You mean your "alter ego"?</i>

20:56.054 --> 20:57.646
I'm a princess.

20:57.889 --> 21:01.120
- Cindy, you're not a princess.
- But I look pretty.

21:01.293 --> 21:04.660
Yeah, but pretty girls don't have any
real friends and they never get any respect.

21:04.730 --> 21:06.595
Take Miss Holloway, for instance.

21:06.665 --> 21:07.723
<i>Hey.</i>

21:11.570 --> 21:13.003
Scatter.

21:16.642 --> 21:18.610
Nice toss, Cindy. Really good.

21:18.677 --> 21:22.113
Why don't you get a juice box
and a Rice Krispy treat?

21:48.206 --> 21:51.198
It's unbelievable.
It's as if he's not even there.

21:51.276 --> 21:54.439
- Because he's not there.
- He's escaped again.

21:55.080 --> 21:56.877
<i>Security, Code Dylan.</i>

21:57.449 --> 21:59.781
<i>I repeat, Code Dylan. Thank you.</i>

22:00.385 --> 22:04.378
- I don't know why he does that.
- Because he doesn't like it here, Grant.

22:04.456 --> 22:06.549
Don't know why not. It's good food.

22:06.625 --> 22:10.026
Dr. Grant.
Tucker won't come out of the bullpen.

22:12.864 --> 22:14.491
It's okay, Tucker.

22:14.566 --> 22:17.330
I know you don't have any control
over this thing yet,

22:17.402 --> 22:18.960
but can you please try to expand?

22:19.037 --> 22:21.130
- I am trying, all right?
- You're wasting your time.

22:21.206 --> 22:24.937
- Jack, you are undermining his confidence.
- What confidence?

22:25.344 --> 22:27.676
He's a lazy little chubba bubba.

22:34.586 --> 22:38.818
Hey, Marsha.
Exactly what part of him is this?

22:40.092 --> 22:41.252
Help.

22:43.095 --> 22:46.326
Hey there. Those kids
aren't going to be ready for anything.

22:46.398 --> 22:48.764
Unless, of course,
you put Tucker in a vat of paint.

22:48.834 --> 22:51.701
He swells up, you could do a room
in a couple of seconds. Other than that...

22:51.770 --> 22:54.705
Well, maybe if you trained them at all...

22:55.140 --> 22:58.507
Look, you know, it just might help
if I knew what I was training them for.

22:58.577 --> 23:00.977
I'm sorry. I don't have time right now.
I'm late for a meeting.

23:01.046 --> 23:02.513
Look out.

23:03.648 --> 23:05.946
Oh, man... Hey, are you all right?

23:06.017 --> 23:08.008
- Yes.
- That was some fall.

23:08.220 --> 23:12.452
You know, you're a nice woman.
But this whole program is a mistake.

23:13.125 --> 23:16.390
The last thing the world needs is
a bunch of kids running around in costumes

23:16.461 --> 23:18.725
thinking that they're heroes.

23:22.367 --> 23:23.527
Sorry.

23:25.570 --> 23:26.969
What happened to you?

23:27.038 --> 23:29.302
What happened to the Sacred Oath?

23:29.374 --> 23:30.671
Issue number one.

23:30.742 --> 23:35.145
"Faster than fast. Truer than true.
In the pursuit of justice

23:35.213 --> 23:38.546
- "there is no speed limit."
- There is no speed limit.

23:38.617 --> 23:40.482
Yeah. Are you bipolar?

23:40.919 --> 23:42.318
It's a comic book.

23:42.387 --> 23:44.912
It's government propaganda.
They made it up.

23:44.990 --> 23:47.356
- I'm sorry. Who's talking?
- To cover up.

23:47.526 --> 23:51.121
It wasn't true.
It's not... None of that stuff is true.

23:55.934 --> 23:57.629
It was true to me.

24:00.572 --> 24:04.133
The brain scans do not correlate
with the children's test results.

24:04.209 --> 24:07.110
They are subconsciously suppressing
their full abilities.

24:07.179 --> 24:11.275
We face an imminent threat.
These kids have got to be ready now.

24:11.917 --> 24:15.546
Sir, it might help
if I knew what the imminent threat was.

24:16.388 --> 24:19.016
Sorry I'm late. I didn't get the memo.

24:20.058 --> 24:24.085
You know? But I heard the word
"imminent threat." What exactly...

24:24.162 --> 24:27.529
Hold it, Shepard. We're holding a meeting
for people who matter,

24:27.599 --> 24:29.260
and Miss Holloway.

24:29.367 --> 24:30.459
Well,

24:31.136 --> 24:34.765
I think maybe a big bowl of prunes
might turn that frown upside down, General.

24:34.840 --> 24:38.901
Guards, take him where the losers are
plotting another failure. He knows the way.

24:38.977 --> 24:42.413
- Go to see your family, huh?
- Get him out of here now.

24:43.682 --> 24:46.549
<i>Five days and counting.</i>

25:23.655 --> 25:25.088
Scatter.

25:30.562 --> 25:31.824
Holloway.

25:32.063 --> 25:34.930
You mind telling me what was going on
between you and Larraby?

25:35.000 --> 25:36.592
Jack, it's late.

25:36.668 --> 25:40.104
I can't help those kids
unless I know what's going on.

25:43.842 --> 25:47.005
You know, when they started talking
about bringing you in...

25:47.078 --> 25:48.943
- Yeah?
- ...I was ecstatic.

25:50.682 --> 25:53.742
Finally I would meet the only real superhero
left in the world.

25:53.818 --> 25:55.809
Would you let that
superhero stuff go, please?

25:55.887 --> 25:58.981
A hero who would fight for justice
at all costs.

26:01.326 --> 26:02.918
I was a really lonely,

26:03.962 --> 26:05.452
kind of weird child.

26:05.764 --> 26:07.493
Well, at least you know
you've grown out of that.

26:07.566 --> 26:11.002
And the only comfort I found
was in reading about you.

26:11.570 --> 26:14.130
That's because you're out of your mind.

26:14.205 --> 26:17.038
You gotta stop with this comic book stuff.

26:19.444 --> 26:22.038
You know, the first thing you said to me
was that you're not a real superhero.

26:22.113 --> 26:24.638
- Right.
- Well, I didn't believe you then.

26:24.716 --> 26:27.810
But congratulations,
because you have convinced me.

26:27.886 --> 26:29.820
You are nothing but a bitter man

26:29.888 --> 26:33.824
happily getting paid to take your
resentments out on these children.

26:33.892 --> 26:35.382
It's horrible.

26:40.365 --> 26:41.889
All right, then.

26:44.002 --> 26:45.765
We'll do this again.

26:47.906 --> 26:50.397
Hey, that was a good meeting
last night, Grant.

26:50.475 --> 26:52.500
Yeah, it was cool.
It was just a simple staff meeting.

26:52.577 --> 26:54.101
That's what I thought, simple staff meeting,

26:54.212 --> 26:55.736
based on the way
I was shuffled out of there.

26:55.847 --> 26:57.041
So where we going?

26:57.115 --> 26:58.514
We've got combat training tomorrow.

26:58.683 --> 27:01.743
We've got to get you into
some protective gear.

27:08.660 --> 27:12.528
I don't want to hold your hand, thanks.
I don't want to hold your hand.

27:14.032 --> 27:15.727
Let go of my hand.

27:16.801 --> 27:18.701
That's quite painful.

27:19.537 --> 27:23.268
All right. I'll hold your hand. Careful.
And what'd I tell you about costumes?

27:23.341 --> 27:26.174
It's not a costume. It's my perfective gear.

27:26.244 --> 27:28.337
Yeah? How's a ballerina costume
going to protect you?

27:28.413 --> 27:31.348
Are you crazy?
Who wants to hurt a ballerina?

27:32.350 --> 27:34.682
Other ballerinas, Baryshnikov.

27:39.758 --> 27:41.623
Wait a minute. No way.

27:42.427 --> 27:44.418
Is that you, Mr. Pibb?

27:44.562 --> 27:46.291
You recognize me?

27:46.364 --> 27:48.423
How you doing, buddy? Give me five.

27:48.500 --> 27:49.762
Mr. Pibb?

27:49.834 --> 27:51.893
Yeah, that's the name we gave him.

27:51.970 --> 27:54.461
We didn't have many friends down here,
so they built us one.

27:54.506 --> 27:57.202
He'd go get you candy and sodas,
that sort of thing.

27:57.242 --> 27:59.039
You were nice to him.

27:59.210 --> 28:02.646
Do you have to touch things to,
like, understand them?

28:02.681 --> 28:05.411
- Not always.
- What's he thinking about now?

28:05.483 --> 28:08.145
He thinks you've had an increase in mass.

28:08.219 --> 28:09.948
Mr. Pibb.

28:10.021 --> 28:13.184
It's impossible to know
what he thinks, Miss Jones.

28:13.258 --> 28:16.284
His program
is a rudimentary 15-megabyte system.

28:16.361 --> 28:17.658
He has no thoughts.

28:17.729 --> 28:20.289
I suppose you don't have thoughts
of what your life would be like

28:20.365 --> 28:22.492
if you were a figure skater?

28:27.839 --> 28:32.902
Well, then. I guess I'll leave you kids
in the capable hands of Jack Shepard.

28:33.244 --> 28:36.077
You do that, Grant. I'll take care of them.

28:36.614 --> 28:40.072
Mr. Pibb, is that old Rambler
still down in the hangar?

28:41.586 --> 28:43.053
<i>Got the keys?</i>

28:44.355 --> 28:46.550
All right, come on, guys. Watch your heads.

28:46.624 --> 28:49.252
Come on, this way. Get over here.
Go over there.

28:49.327 --> 28:52.455
All right, Pibb.
Knock off the security cameras.

28:53.298 --> 28:55.129
Open the door.

28:56.267 --> 28:57.996
Let's go. Go, go, go.

28:59.971 --> 29:02.599
All right, stand right there. Ready?

29:07.178 --> 29:08.577
- Whoa.
- Whoa.

29:13.218 --> 29:17.052
It's the flying saucer from Area 51. It exists.

29:17.122 --> 29:18.589
Look at that.

29:18.923 --> 29:20.015
Wow.

29:20.125 --> 29:23.151
We rebuilt it as best we could
after it crash-landed in the late '40s.

29:23.228 --> 29:24.991
It's really awesome.

29:25.096 --> 29:26.859
Yeah, it's amazing.

29:27.932 --> 29:29.832
Yeah. It's really cool.

29:31.236 --> 29:35.229
And is this what's going to take us
to all of our superhero gigs?

29:35.774 --> 29:37.833
I'm getting goose bumps.

29:45.483 --> 29:47.781
Got to stabilize this thing.

29:47.852 --> 29:49.717
- Can I try?
- You want to drive?

29:49.788 --> 29:50.948
Yeah, definitely.

29:51.022 --> 29:53.320
All right, just sit down there.

29:53.892 --> 29:57.885
And you want to get your hands in that
green and blue slime.

29:57.962 --> 29:59.293
Right.

29:59.430 --> 30:02.399
- Little gross in there, isn't it?
- Nasty, yeah.

30:02.467 --> 30:03.900
Oh, boy.

30:04.536 --> 30:07.266
- Let's make this thing rock.
- Yeah, how do you make it go faster?

30:07.338 --> 30:11.206
Faster?
Therein lies the problem, guys, of the FE-12.

30:11.476 --> 30:13.273
We never really figured this thing out.

30:13.344 --> 30:15.642
It only goes 20 miles an hour.

30:19.751 --> 30:23.551
Maybe there's less to figure out
than there is to understand.

30:27.926 --> 30:29.917
Hey, barbeque, to go.

30:32.997 --> 30:34.760
Tucker, put the cow back.

30:34.833 --> 30:35.822
But I'm hungry.

30:35.900 --> 30:37.367
- Tucker.
- All right.

30:45.043 --> 30:46.670
Hey, hey, hey. Watch the...

30:48.179 --> 30:49.612
...light pole.

30:51.883 --> 30:54.477
<i>Hello. Welcome to Wendy's.</i>
<i>May I take your order, please?</i>

30:54.552 --> 30:56.520
- Classic Triple, lettuce, tomato.
- Get me one.

30:56.588 --> 30:59.648
Classic Triple, lettuce, tomato... I got it.

31:00.291 --> 31:01.349
Classic...

31:01.426 --> 31:04.088
- Can you see? Can you see this?
- No, it's all green and blurry.

31:04.162 --> 31:05.925
- Extra fries.
- Hold on a second.

31:09.467 --> 31:12.265
I'm going to have a...
What kind of toys do you have?

31:12.337 --> 31:16.205
Chicken. Spicy Chicken Sandwich.
The other order's Crispy Nuggets.

31:16.274 --> 31:18.265
- Is that it?
- Six Frosties.

31:18.343 --> 31:20.004
Six Frosties. Chocolate.

31:20.078 --> 31:23.070
All right.
Now, what's everyone else drinking?

31:46.170 --> 31:47.899
<i>We come in peace.</i>

31:54.913 --> 31:56.540
Take me with you.

31:57.015 --> 31:59.245
<i>That's right, Bob. We're outside the Wendy's</i>
<i>where apparently</i>

31:59.417 --> 32:02.511
<i>a lot of people have seen</i>
<i>some type of flying saucer.</i>

32:02.553 --> 32:05.215
<i>I'm here with David right now,</i>
<i>who actually works at Wendy's.</i>

32:05.290 --> 32:06.552
<i>David, can you tell us what you saw?</i>

32:06.624 --> 32:10.185
<i>I saw the flying saucer. I saw it land.</i>
<i>I saw it make this noise that it made.</i>

32:10.261 --> 32:12.195
<i>It went...</i>

32:12.263 --> 32:14.231
<i>as it wobbled, and then...</i>

32:14.832 --> 32:16.959
<i>That's it. That's the way they sounded.</i>

32:17.035 --> 32:19.629
- <i>That's the way it was.</i>
- <i>And you actually saw the aliens? I mean...</i>

32:19.704 --> 32:22.901
<i>Well, it's not that...</i>
<i>The alien in the spaceship ordered from me.</i>

32:22.974 --> 32:26.740
<i>You know, I don't know.</i>
<i>Maybe the spaceship runs on ice cream.</i>

32:26.844 --> 32:28.038
<i>That's my theory.</i>

32:28.112 --> 32:31.047
<i>Because he ordered</i>
<i>a whole bunch of Frosties.</i>

32:31.783 --> 32:33.080
Oh, no.

32:40.391 --> 32:42.188
Just go back and act like nothing happened.

32:42.260 --> 32:44.922
We had a great day. Let's just
leave it at that. All right, you guys?

32:44.996 --> 32:47.294
If I were you, Dylan, I'd disappear.
Hey, Marsha.

32:47.365 --> 32:49.765
Mr. Shepard. How dare you?

32:50.101 --> 32:54.697
- Do you even know what you've done?
- Yeah. I got you a hot chicken sandwich.

32:55.273 --> 32:56.763
No, thank you.

32:57.141 --> 32:58.233
Are you a vegetarian?

32:58.409 --> 33:01.901
You're supposed to be training these kids
for their first simulation.

33:01.946 --> 33:05.040
And instead, you're out gallivanting
in a stolen spaceship.

33:05.116 --> 33:06.845
Was I gallivanting?

33:07.318 --> 33:10.685
Looks like the saucer's not the only
thing stuck in the '50s.

33:10.755 --> 33:12.484
You're probably 50.

33:23.801 --> 33:25.769
I'm not a vegetarian.

33:26.671 --> 33:29.469
It's a life choice. Nothing wrong with it.

33:53.364 --> 33:54.729
Cindy.

33:54.799 --> 33:56.824
Let go of my face, please.

34:00.872 --> 34:02.737
What are you doing in here?

34:02.807 --> 34:04.468
I had a bad dream.

34:07.011 --> 34:08.103
Well,

34:09.981 --> 34:12.211
I'm sorry you had a bad dream.

34:13.851 --> 34:16.183
That's easy to do here, I guess.

34:16.587 --> 34:17.679
You...

34:23.261 --> 34:25.821
- Let's walk you back to your room.
- Can I sleep here?

34:25.897 --> 34:28.798
- Just for tonight?
- No, that's not a real good idea.

34:33.137 --> 34:35.731
You don't want to stay here. I snore.

34:36.474 --> 34:37.702
I'm quite gassy.

34:37.775 --> 34:39.140
I'm scared.

34:40.945 --> 34:42.913
Hello? Little help here?

34:47.985 --> 34:49.612
You want to stay on the couch?

34:49.687 --> 34:51.314
Thanks, Mr. Zoom.

34:54.125 --> 34:56.025
Can you let the light in?

34:56.094 --> 34:57.186
Yeah.

34:57.862 --> 34:59.853
I'll leave the door open.

35:00.031 --> 35:03.489
Because why would we want it dark
while we're sleeping?

35:07.905 --> 35:09.566
Good night, Cindy.

35:13.911 --> 35:15.242
Mr. Zoom?

35:15.313 --> 35:16.803
Cindy, please.

35:17.181 --> 35:18.705
Am I different?

35:21.619 --> 35:22.711
Yeah.

35:23.054 --> 35:25.181
You know, but in a good way.

35:25.756 --> 35:26.848
I feel too different.

35:26.924 --> 35:29.222
Yeah, I'm sure you do,
because you're wearing a rabbit outfit.

35:29.293 --> 35:30.692
You gotta go to sleep, Cindy.

35:30.761 --> 35:33.491
Is that why Mommy and Daddy
sent me here?

35:44.375 --> 35:45.569
Listen.

35:46.577 --> 35:48.636
You were right the first day.

35:48.713 --> 35:50.374
You're special.

35:50.448 --> 35:52.882
There's nobody in the world
that can do what you do.

35:52.950 --> 35:54.611
Your parents, who love you very much,

35:54.685 --> 35:58.416
they sent you here
so you'd learn how to use your difference

36:00.458 --> 36:01.982
to help people.

36:06.964 --> 36:08.226
Good night.

36:33.357 --> 36:34.722
Good night.

36:35.326 --> 36:37.453
That was bolted to the wall.

36:45.903 --> 36:50.567
<i>Welcome to our fully operational,</i>
<i>multi-platform J-1000 mission simulator.</i>

36:51.008 --> 36:54.205
<i>It is imperative</i>
<i>that you learn to avoid enemy fire.</i>

36:54.245 --> 36:55.610
A bit more advanced than in your day, eh?

36:55.646 --> 36:57.841
Yeah, in my day
we just had that British guy named Ben

36:58.015 --> 36:59.414
who threw sticks at us.

36:59.450 --> 37:00.883
So what are the holes for?

37:00.952 --> 37:03.785
It's funny you should ask that.
That's the first question people ask.

37:03.854 --> 37:06.414
Our technician is Dick. Dick?

37:07.225 --> 37:09.955
The holes are for firing the paintballs.

37:10.895 --> 37:12.692
All right. I'm out of here.

37:12.763 --> 37:15.391
Oh, great. Another Code Dylan.

37:15.466 --> 37:17.559
He must like that isolation room.

37:17.635 --> 37:20.331
<i>We'll have to proceed without Mr. West.</i>

37:21.606 --> 37:25.633
The objective is to get the kids
to 70% combat capacity.

37:25.743 --> 37:30.112
I'm going to start them off easily,
about 10%. What do you think? 10%?

37:30.181 --> 37:32.240
Yeah, yeah. That sounds great.

37:32.316 --> 37:33.874
Dick, 10.

37:39.523 --> 37:44.222
Children, your goal is to stop the simulator
by pressing that red button in the center.

37:44.295 --> 37:46.263
How hard can that be?

37:46.364 --> 37:47.991
I don't know.

37:59.043 --> 38:01.978
Are you working on attraction or repulsion?

38:02.046 --> 38:03.206
Watch.

38:05.483 --> 38:06.780
Ready?

38:15.960 --> 38:18.087
That would be attraction.

38:19.764 --> 38:21.664
Oh, I'm sorry. I didn't...

38:22.433 --> 38:23.627
Meanie.

38:23.934 --> 38:25.128
Oh, no.

38:51.595 --> 38:53.654
- Watch out.
- Look out.

38:56.667 --> 38:58.134
I'm getting...

39:05.443 --> 39:06.910
I want a name.

39:06.977 --> 39:09.377
Ten more, that's your name.

39:15.553 --> 39:17.111
Get me a name.

39:17.254 --> 39:20.155
Hey. How about nine more?
There's your name.

39:45.082 --> 39:47.016
Excuse me, Dr. Grant.

39:49.120 --> 39:50.781
Sorry, Dr. Grant.

39:50.855 --> 39:52.322
Why the rush, kids?

39:59.363 --> 40:00.887
Watch out.

40:08.806 --> 40:12.401
You see, it all works together
in a double helix.

40:12.977 --> 40:14.945
So if you can manage to...

40:16.380 --> 40:20.612
I've got a thing. If you could get the
double helix going, I'll be right back.

40:22.553 --> 40:24.255
Think double helix.

40:25.656 --> 40:28.489
- That was ridiculous.
- That was really bad.

40:28.959 --> 40:30.756
I thought it was fun.

40:35.065 --> 40:38.057
Hey, guys. I shook down
our robot buddy, Mr. Pibb,

40:38.135 --> 40:39.864
and I got you some snacks.

40:39.937 --> 40:42.030
I got mine already. Thanks.

40:44.041 --> 40:46.271
You guys look like modern art.

40:48.612 --> 40:50.546
Come on.
How'd you guys think the training went?

40:50.614 --> 40:54.175
- Oh, please. Like you care.
- Hey. Chill out a little bit.

40:54.652 --> 40:57.177
I'm not the one that dropped you off
here at the military base, you know.

40:57.254 --> 41:01.315
No, you didn't drop us off here,
but you were supposed to teach us.

41:03.461 --> 41:06.055
Thanks for all the training, Captain.

41:06.230 --> 41:08.596
- You don't care about us.
- She's right.

41:08.866 --> 41:13.303
I got hit with so many paintballs,
I've got more bruises than skin.

41:13.370 --> 41:15.099
- Mr. Shepard?
- What?

41:15.840 --> 41:17.501
You care about us,

41:18.008 --> 41:19.168
right?

41:21.846 --> 41:23.370
I brought cake.

41:23.814 --> 41:27.113
Don't be fooled, Cindy.
He only cares about himself.

41:27.918 --> 41:29.613
Come here. Let's go get you cleaned up.

41:29.687 --> 41:31.279
Wait. Hey, look.

41:38.062 --> 41:39.154
Cake.

41:50.341 --> 41:52.809
Smells like old socks in here.

41:52.877 --> 41:54.435
Is he in there?

41:59.216 --> 42:01.582
Sucks being in here, doesn't it?

42:01.852 --> 42:03.717
You know, Larraby actually knitted this.

42:03.787 --> 42:07.279
He and Grant, buck naked by a fire,
knit one, purl two.

42:07.625 --> 42:10.594
They knitted this to contain people like us.

42:11.829 --> 42:13.763
I got out of here three times.

42:13.831 --> 42:16.698
And I'll bet Cindy could get out of here
whenever she wanted to.

42:16.767 --> 42:20.134
When I was her age, I used to just have
one leg work faster than the other.

42:20.204 --> 42:21.967
I did this kind of fast hopping thing.

42:22.039 --> 42:23.700
So you could skip?

42:23.774 --> 42:25.708
Hop. Let's go with hop.

42:26.810 --> 42:29.108
One day, a bunch of my buddies
wanted to go down to the creek,

42:29.179 --> 42:32.012
you know, to throw fish at each other,
paint our face. Guy stuff, you know.

42:32.082 --> 42:35.142
I wanted to go there so bad
that I concentrated

42:35.219 --> 42:38.620
- and I just began to do my little...
- Skipping thing.

42:38.923 --> 42:40.185
Hopping.

42:41.025 --> 42:44.222
All of a sudden, man, I was there.
Boy, they noticed that.

42:44.295 --> 42:46.320
And then other people noticed.

42:46.931 --> 42:49.900
People like the Zenith Program,
they noticed.

42:50.734 --> 42:53.965
So they dragged me and my...
They dragged me and my older brother...

42:54.038 --> 42:57.974
- I didn't know you had a brother.
- They dragged me here, and Grant,

42:58.042 --> 43:01.443
<i>I think he's had enough. Let him out.</i>
<i>Come on, Dylan.</i>

43:04.081 --> 43:05.742
<i>This is Control.</i>

43:05.816 --> 43:08.182
This is Mr. Grant. You can release Dr. West.

43:08.252 --> 43:11.244
I'm sorry. This is Dr. West.
Could you release Mr. Grant?

43:11.322 --> 43:13.415
- <i>Okay, you want us to release...</i>
- No, don't release Dr. Grant.

43:13.490 --> 43:15.958
- Release Mr. West.
- <i>Wait, you want us... You just said...</i>

43:16.026 --> 43:18.290
- Just do what I say.
- <i>Yes, sir.</i>

43:23.667 --> 43:25.897
<i>Two days and counting.</i>

43:31.508 --> 43:34.341
I'm pretty sure the ice cream's this way.

43:38.282 --> 43:40.750
"Outdoor Survival Simulator"?

43:49.760 --> 43:50.784
Sweet.

43:52.863 --> 43:54.694
This room is so cool.

43:57.901 --> 44:00.267
What's Dr. Grant doing in there?

44:00.638 --> 44:01.730
Look.

44:02.506 --> 44:04.064
Close the door.

44:09.279 --> 44:10.405
Kids.

44:10.681 --> 44:13.582
Very good. That's great. It's closing up.

44:13.651 --> 44:14.879
<i>Keep it open just a...</i>

44:14.952 --> 44:17.716
It's going... Oh, no, it's go... No, no.

44:18.422 --> 44:19.684
It closed.

44:19.757 --> 44:22.920
<i>Good job.</i>
<i>Shouldn't you be in bed? Seriously.</i>

44:22.944 --> 45:13.259
WWW.GOPISAHI.PW

44:23.260 --> 44:25.194
<i>Are you waiting for Peter Pan?</i>

44:26.230 --> 44:27.595
I'm just kidding around. Tucker.

44:27.665 --> 44:31.260
<i>Could you back off the control panel</i>
<i>a little bit? There are buttons on there</i>

44:31.335 --> 44:33.098
I really don't want you to push,

44:33.170 --> 44:34.535
<i>because...</i>

44:42.613 --> 44:45.446
I told you not to...
Why didn't you listen to me?

44:45.783 --> 44:46.977
<i>Okay, that's it.</i>

44:47.051 --> 44:51.351
Summer, I want you to open that door.
I want the rain to stop right away,

44:51.555 --> 44:52.647
<i>please.</i>

44:52.723 --> 44:54.554
You're making me very angry, children.

44:54.625 --> 44:56.752
<i>This is not funny. This is not...</i>

45:03.934 --> 45:05.561
What's he doing?

45:05.936 --> 45:08.404
Press another button. Do not push button.

45:09.473 --> 45:11.065
I told you, no button.

45:12.276 --> 45:13.538
If you...

45:21.852 --> 45:23.217
<i>No more buttons.</i>

45:44.408 --> 45:45.875
Do it, Cindy.

46:14.404 --> 46:16.429
Oh, nasty. Come on.

46:26.817 --> 46:30.344
It is the emotional core that is missing
in these children's lives.

46:30.420 --> 46:33.116
<i>...that magnetizes so you can't move.</i>

46:33.190 --> 46:36.023
<i>Put your head against these little diodes</i>
<i>and they give you</i>

46:36.093 --> 46:39.460
<i>13 times the lethal dose</i>

46:40.030 --> 46:41.793
<i>of Gamma radiation.</i>

46:42.166 --> 46:44.031
<i>And that made you more powerful?</i>

46:44.101 --> 46:45.932
Dylan, they're not going to put you in here.

46:46.003 --> 46:47.732
That's why I'm here.

46:47.805 --> 46:50.365
To encourage your talents naturally.

46:51.708 --> 46:56.111
Dylan, I'm talking to you. Where do you go
when you fuzz out like that?

46:56.847 --> 46:57.836
I...

46:58.415 --> 47:01.976
You don't perchance get a little headache
over your eye when you do that, do you?

47:02.052 --> 47:03.212
Maybe.

47:03.287 --> 47:04.549
Maybe?

47:05.122 --> 47:06.316
Maybe.

47:06.490 --> 47:09.015
Dylan, I got an idea.

47:09.259 --> 47:13.320
<i>I want you to think about Summer right now.</i>
<i>Stand here and see if you can find her.</i>

47:13.397 --> 47:15.490
- <i>But she's nowhere near here.</i>
- <i>I understand that.</i>

47:15.566 --> 47:19.832
Trust your instincts. Go down this hallway
in your mind and find her.

47:37.888 --> 47:39.515
I'm in her room.

47:40.090 --> 47:41.352
No, I...

47:42.960 --> 47:44.860
I can see her dancing.

47:48.465 --> 47:52.561
This is unbelievable. This is a real gift.
It's called mind-sight.

47:53.270 --> 47:54.396
Look,

47:55.372 --> 47:59.308
these kids are going to need a leader.
This team needs one.

47:59.576 --> 48:02.409
And a leader is someone
who can see the way.

48:02.446 --> 48:04.414
I think that may be you.

48:06.950 --> 48:10.579
<i>And which one of the old team</i>
<i>had the mind-sight thing like me?</i>

48:10.654 --> 48:12.849
- <i>Oh, Marksman.</i>
- <i>Marksman.</i>

48:13.724 --> 48:16.818
What happened to him?
And your girlfriend, Ace?

48:17.127 --> 48:20.688
They all lost their lives doing what they do,
being heroes.

48:20.764 --> 48:23.028
- Like in the comic book.
- Yeah.

48:24.034 --> 48:27.435
So this killer, Concussion...
I thought that was all made up.

48:27.504 --> 48:29.438
Some of it was made up.

48:29.873 --> 48:34.071
So this maniac wiped out the whole team?

48:34.444 --> 48:37.811
It really wasn't his fault.
I mean, they made him into that.

48:37.881 --> 48:39.906
He was part of the team?

48:40.584 --> 48:42.711
- Yeah.
- And you trusted him.

48:43.086 --> 48:44.280
He was your friend, and he...

48:44.354 --> 48:47.448
You don't know what
you're talking about, okay?

48:48.792 --> 48:50.953
Concussion was your brother.

48:54.564 --> 48:56.361
His name was Connor.

50:05.869 --> 50:08.303
Summer, what's with the necklace?

50:10.007 --> 50:13.670
It was the last thing my parents gave me
before they left.

50:13.877 --> 50:16.607
I guess they couldn't handle my powers.

50:19.783 --> 50:21.011
Can I...

50:35.665 --> 50:38.634
I'm sorry, Miss Holloway.
We couldn't find him anywhere.

50:38.702 --> 50:40.329
Okay. Thank you.

50:43.173 --> 50:47.473
All right. Well, we'll just have
to proceed without Mr. Shepard today.

50:48.078 --> 50:50.069
If everyone will open up their books...

50:50.147 --> 50:52.911
Hey, sorry I'm late,
but I had to get my gang together.

50:52.983 --> 50:56.749
Make the measurements, guys.
Don't be afraid to tickle them.

50:59.623 --> 51:02.148
It almost looks like you're glad to see me.

51:03.126 --> 51:08.063
No, no, I'm not... I'm not glad to see you.
I mean, the children are glad to see you.

51:08.665 --> 51:12.863
And, well, I guess if they're glad to see you,
then I'm glad to see you. I don't know.

51:12.936 --> 51:14.460
Okay. I'm glad.

51:14.538 --> 51:16.028
- Go ahead.
- Okay.

51:16.106 --> 51:18.472
Well, anyway, kids,
this is what we're going to do.

51:18.542 --> 51:20.271
We're gonna continue
your physical training,

51:20.343 --> 51:22.277
along with your teamwork exercises,

51:22.345 --> 51:25.371
but to complement your internal strengths.

51:26.483 --> 51:29.043
- When do we get names?
- We'll deal with that, but right now,

51:29.119 --> 51:31.053
most importantly,
I want to deal with the fundamentals,

51:31.121 --> 51:34.181
and there's two fundamentals,
control and execution.

51:34.257 --> 51:36.817
Think about it. Control and execution.

51:36.893 --> 51:38.656
Come on, guys. Follow me.

51:44.501 --> 51:46.799
One. Two. Three.

51:57.848 --> 51:58.974
Pull.

52:01.318 --> 52:02.842
You all right?

52:02.919 --> 52:05.683
He's invented a super fabric for Tucker.

52:06.356 --> 52:08.119
Congratulations, Ed.

52:15.465 --> 52:16.591
Yeah.

52:18.835 --> 52:23.499
The coolest, strongest, best time
you ever attracted or repelled something

52:23.573 --> 52:26.041
because whenever that was, it was just...

52:29.412 --> 52:30.743
Nailed it.

52:40.957 --> 52:42.185
Thanks.

52:54.237 --> 52:55.829
- I got it.
- Yes.

53:02.679 --> 53:03.668
Yeah!

53:04.981 --> 53:06.744
Yeah, man. Nice job.

53:09.786 --> 53:11.549
Well, how are they?

53:12.189 --> 53:14.555
They're enjoying their victory.

53:15.225 --> 53:17.591
- It's been quite a week for them.
- Yeah.

53:18.128 --> 53:20.460
Why the sudden change of heart?

53:22.666 --> 53:25.499
They're becoming a real team, those kids.

53:25.902 --> 53:30.339
And I didn't realize what an incredible team
I had until they were gone.

53:31.041 --> 53:34.010
And I'd like them
to avoid that same mistake.

53:35.111 --> 53:36.203
Nuts?

53:36.613 --> 53:38.274
No. It's beautiful.

53:38.348 --> 53:40.509
No, I mean do you like nuts?

53:41.585 --> 53:43.018
Yes, please.

53:43.386 --> 53:45.411
- There you go.
- Thank you.

53:45.789 --> 53:48.815
I think if we'd had someone
who cared about us

53:49.292 --> 53:52.090
and taught us to succeed as a family,

53:52.295 --> 53:57.198
things would've been different for Connor,
and certainly for the rest of the team.

53:57.767 --> 53:59.166
Somebody...

54:00.737 --> 54:02.432
Somebody like you.

54:08.411 --> 54:10.276
I ain't cleaning that up.

54:11.481 --> 54:14.917
<i>Our only hope lies</i>
<i>with Marsha and Zoom training the kids.</i>

54:14.985 --> 54:17.180
<i>You can't be considering Gamma radiation</i>

54:17.254 --> 54:19.586
<i>after what happened to Zoom's brother?</i>

54:19.656 --> 54:22.750
<i>Concussion becoming evil</i>
<i>was a horrible result.</i>

54:26.162 --> 54:29.029
<i>He's coming for Zoom</i>
<i>sooner than I thought.</i>

54:29.899 --> 54:32.197
And this is where he'll emerge.

54:32.469 --> 54:36.735
These will allow you to see
the dimensional rift we've been tracking.

54:39.509 --> 54:41.977
He's more powerful than I thought.

54:42.512 --> 54:45.948
You better have a plan
that works this time, birdbrain.

54:46.016 --> 54:48.007
Well, the kids will have to distract him

54:48.084 --> 54:51.053
so that we can launch
the sonic net I've designed.

54:51.121 --> 54:53.055
The net will capture him in such a way

54:53.123 --> 54:55.853
that it causes him
to concuss back on himself.

54:55.892 --> 54:59.328
- Is that our only option?
- Well, if Zoom still had his powers,

54:59.496 --> 55:01.361
his speed could create a mega vortex

55:01.398 --> 55:05.357
which would trap Concussion and reverse
the dark effects of the Gamma radiation.

55:05.435 --> 55:07.266
How much time have we got?

55:08.104 --> 55:10.129
Forty-eight hours. Tops.

55:19.115 --> 55:20.605
Anybody home?

55:20.684 --> 55:21.946
- Hi.
- Hey.

55:22.252 --> 55:24.686
- Nothing to wear?
- How'd you guess?

55:25.789 --> 55:28.656
Come here. Maybe I have something for you.

55:32.462 --> 55:35.488
There it is. I knew it was in here somewhere.

55:36.499 --> 55:37.557
Wow.

55:38.301 --> 55:39.393
Pretty.

55:43.773 --> 55:45.297
That's perfect.

55:45.375 --> 55:47.343
- Are you sure?
- Oh, yeah.

55:47.410 --> 55:50.777
It's just one of many purchased
for dates that never happened.

55:50.847 --> 55:53.748
Turned out to be lonely nights
reading my comic books.

55:53.817 --> 55:55.944
In between the crying fits.

55:57.253 --> 55:59.414
It all started with my prom.

56:00.623 --> 56:05.060
I always thought the prom queen
should be the girl with the highest I.Q.

56:05.528 --> 56:07.587
Now that would make sense.

56:29.285 --> 56:32.846
Finally, a woman without a lab coat.
We got a party now.

56:33.757 --> 56:35.554
You know, I like having you here.
Don't get me wrong.

56:35.625 --> 56:38.594
But I'm not sure Cindy
can handle the competition.

56:38.661 --> 56:42.757
- This is really nice of you.
- Well, they worked hard. They deserve this.

57:01.751 --> 57:03.309
Look at Summer.

57:06.289 --> 57:07.586
- Hi.
- Hey.

57:08.391 --> 57:10.757
So, where are you going dressed like that?

57:10.827 --> 57:13.022
Why? Do I look stupid?

57:13.096 --> 57:14.961
No, you look nice.

57:17.500 --> 57:19.593
- Hi.
- Hey.

57:21.971 --> 57:24.701
- You like it?
- Yeah. You look beautiful.

57:26.476 --> 57:29.001
I thought your necklace looked a little bare,

57:29.078 --> 57:31.342
so I made this for you in R and D.

57:37.287 --> 57:40.586
For everything I see in you,
and everything I don't.

57:44.694 --> 57:47.162
I think your powers are wonderful.

57:49.032 --> 57:50.966
I'm not that wonderful.

57:51.634 --> 57:53.659
I mean, I just hope you're not disappointed

57:53.736 --> 57:56.500
with what you do or don't see from here.

57:57.373 --> 57:59.603
As long as I get to keep looking,

57:59.676 --> 58:02.611
I guarantee you I'll never be disappointed.

58:25.435 --> 58:27.266
Do you want to dance?

58:29.873 --> 58:30.931
Yes.

58:31.441 --> 58:34.842
Do you mind if we take these off?
Because you are so...

58:35.745 --> 58:36.939
blind.

58:37.413 --> 58:39.176
Whoa. Let me put these back on.

58:39.249 --> 58:40.773
No, it's okay.

58:41.885 --> 58:44.718
You'll just have to move a little closer.

58:47.757 --> 58:49.554
Still can't see you.

59:00.103 --> 59:02.537
What the hey is going on here?

59:02.605 --> 59:04.266
This room is off-limits.

59:04.340 --> 59:07.571
Hey. Come on, Your Highness, calm down.
You're going to have a stroke.

59:07.644 --> 59:09.805
Look. Have a drink.
The kids are just having fun.

59:09.879 --> 59:12.313
The kids want to have a little fun?
I like to have fun.

59:12.382 --> 59:14.748
Kids, let's take a 10-mile run.

59:15.418 --> 59:18.819
Guards. Holloway.
Make sure it happens now. Move out.

59:20.490 --> 59:23.288
Boy, for a straight guy, you're dramatic.

59:25.328 --> 59:26.852
What's all this stuff? What are you doing?

59:26.930 --> 59:29.592
Something I should have done long ago.

59:32.835 --> 59:34.996
You're going to hurt these kids
like you hurt my team.

59:35.071 --> 59:37.699
To meet my standards, whatever it takes.

59:37.774 --> 59:40.800
We'll be starting first thing in the morning.

59:46.616 --> 59:48.345
Let's get cracking.

59:53.690 --> 59:56.716
Hey, guys. Everybody. Get up. Come on.
Get up.

59:58.494 --> 1:00:01.725
Come on, gorgeous. Hop up.
Sleeping's for wimps. Get up. Come on.

1:00:01.798 --> 1:00:04.164
Come on. Come on.
Come on, come on. There you go.

1:00:04.233 --> 1:00:06.360
Everybody. Come on. Get up.

1:00:06.769 --> 1:00:08.930
Hurry, before the guards see us.

1:00:09.005 --> 1:00:12.736
Good, good, good. Figured you guys
would be getting tired of sleeping.

1:00:12.809 --> 1:00:16.370
Come on. Tucker, come on, buddy, get up.
Roll that big potato out of bed.

1:00:16.446 --> 1:00:19.904
Hit your light. There you go, come on.
Get up, get up.

1:00:21.651 --> 1:00:22.743
What's the matter with you?

1:00:22.819 --> 1:00:26.414
What time did you go to bed last night?
How tired can you guys...

1:00:26.589 --> 1:00:31.356
All right. Somebody brush his teeth,
get him in his outfit. Let's go. Come on.

1:00:32.195 --> 1:00:33.787
I said let's go.

1:00:52.415 --> 1:00:53.905
All right, all right.

1:00:53.983 --> 1:00:57.316
What are you dressed as, Super-Poodle?
What is that?

1:00:59.689 --> 1:01:01.418
Where are we going?

1:01:02.291 --> 1:01:05.385
Oh, neat. An electrical panel.

1:01:10.800 --> 1:01:13.098
It's a secret electrical panel.

1:01:13.169 --> 1:01:14.329
Quiet.

1:01:16.172 --> 1:01:17.434
Come on.

1:01:20.643 --> 1:01:23.578
I'm tired. Let's go back to bed.

1:01:23.646 --> 1:01:25.409
- I'm hungry.
- I'm cold.

1:01:25.481 --> 1:01:28.143
Stop whining. Superheroes don't whine.

1:01:31.521 --> 1:01:32.818
Where are we?

1:01:32.889 --> 1:01:36.052
We are someplace
where the cameras won't see us.

1:01:37.927 --> 1:01:40.487
- Whoa, what is this?
- Are we getting our names?

1:01:40.563 --> 1:01:42.622
Finally, we get our names.

1:01:42.965 --> 1:01:45.024
Wait, I thought you said names don't matter.

1:01:45.101 --> 1:01:49.162
All right, all right. I was mistaken.
You want names? You got to have names.

1:01:49.238 --> 1:01:52.696
Chubby will now be called
"The Incredible Bulk."

1:01:52.742 --> 1:01:54.334
- Oh, dude.
- That's stupid.

1:01:54.377 --> 1:01:57.403
You, the bully, let's call you "Strong Girl."

1:01:57.580 --> 1:02:00.071
- I want something pretty.
- That is pretty.

1:02:00.116 --> 1:02:01.674
- No, it's not.
- Yes, it is pretty.

1:02:01.751 --> 1:02:04.481
And for you, let's go with "Mental Chick."

1:02:04.554 --> 1:02:06.613
- Mental Chick?
- I like that.

1:02:06.689 --> 1:02:08.156
- That is not funny.
- Yes, it is.

1:02:08.224 --> 1:02:09.816
- I think it's good, 'cause you're...
- I like it.

1:02:09.892 --> 1:02:11.484
That's terrible. You're not calling me that.

1:02:11.561 --> 1:02:13.825
Yeah, Mental Chick and Invisiteen.

1:02:13.896 --> 1:02:16.194
Whoa. No, that is terrible.

1:02:16.265 --> 1:02:18.495
- Come on. You're Mega-Boy.
- Mega-Boy?

1:02:18.568 --> 1:02:20.195
- What do you call me?
- Houdini.

1:02:20.269 --> 1:02:22.203
- Houdini?
- You know? He's always escaping stuff.

1:02:22.271 --> 1:02:23.636
- Princess.
- Princess.

1:02:23.706 --> 1:02:26.072
- And she's Wonder.
- Thanks.

1:02:26.142 --> 1:02:29.441
All right, I give up. You guys want to
name yourselves, you've named yourselves.

1:02:29.512 --> 1:02:30.809
- Houdini.
- Princess.

1:02:30.880 --> 1:02:32.347
- Wonder.
- Mega-Boy.

1:02:32.415 --> 1:02:35.077
- Now we're a team.
- Now we're a family.

1:02:38.488 --> 1:02:40.217
And this family is getting out of here.

1:02:40.289 --> 1:02:42.189
I'm taking you someplace safe tonight.

1:02:42.258 --> 1:02:44.590
- But we're heroes now.
- And we have names and everything.

1:02:44.660 --> 1:02:46.628
I know you do.
You have names, you're heroes,

1:02:46.696 --> 1:02:48.857
but I think it'd be safer
if we just got out of here.

1:02:48.931 --> 1:02:50.900
Take the FE-12, we can use that and...

1:02:52.835 --> 1:02:54.860
What's the matter, Dylan?

1:02:55.705 --> 1:02:57.468
<i>I'm in a hallway.</i>

1:02:57.840 --> 1:02:59.432
Stay out of the ladies' room.

1:02:59.509 --> 1:03:01.943
<i>Okay, now, I'm in a control room.</i>

1:03:02.245 --> 1:03:06.045
- <i>What do you see?</i>
- <i>I see Dr. Grant and Larraby.</i>

1:03:06.716 --> 1:03:09.480
Tell me they're wearing women's dresses.

1:03:12.021 --> 1:03:14.489
There's frozen images on a screen.

1:03:17.393 --> 1:03:19.258
I know what they're training us for.

1:03:19.328 --> 1:03:20.454
What?

1:03:21.264 --> 1:03:22.754
Your brother.

1:03:24.100 --> 1:03:26.728
He's alive. He's coming back.

1:03:32.041 --> 1:03:33.508
That's impossible.

1:03:33.576 --> 1:03:35.271
Stay out of sight.

1:03:38.181 --> 1:03:42.447
<i>General Larraby, it is only a matter</i>
<i>of moments before Concussion will be here.</i>

1:03:42.885 --> 1:03:47.288
<i>At 8:59 p.m., the portal broke through</i>
<i>the final dimension.</i>

1:03:50.693 --> 1:03:53.560
Wow. Just when I was beginning to like you.

1:03:53.629 --> 1:03:56.598
"It's all for the kids, helping them cope,
bring out what's best in them."

1:03:56.666 --> 1:04:00.158
- What are you talking about?
- Stop the innocent routine, okay?

1:04:00.336 --> 1:04:01.462
What?

1:04:02.405 --> 1:04:03.497
Jack.

1:04:03.573 --> 1:04:06.133
That's when we deploy the sonic net.

1:04:07.009 --> 1:04:08.738
What the hell's going on?

1:04:09.846 --> 1:04:12.041
Right now, my stomach flesh is burning.

1:04:12.114 --> 1:04:15.572
- Jack. Jack, can you talk to me?
- Not now, Holloway.

1:04:15.651 --> 1:04:17.414
Guards, get her out of here.

1:04:17.486 --> 1:04:20.546
My brother is alive? Why didn't you tell me?

1:04:21.123 --> 1:04:25.992
Well, you know... Is that a flock of birds
or my car alarm? Hold on a minute.

1:04:26.062 --> 1:04:28.758
We didn't tell you about Connor
because you didn't need to know.

1:04:28.831 --> 1:04:32.460
They're going to be heroes, Jack,
and heroes always do the right thing.

1:04:32.535 --> 1:04:34.833
You're going to send these kids
up against Concussion?

1:04:34.904 --> 1:04:36.633
They'll never have a chance.

1:04:36.706 --> 1:04:40.972
Not the way you've trained them.
Guards, take this bozo away.

1:04:41.644 --> 1:04:44.169
<i>One hour and counting.</i>

1:04:47.049 --> 1:04:50.143
I'm way too big for this. You can't... Guys...

1:04:51.020 --> 1:04:53.318
You know, they're just a bunch of kids.

1:04:53.389 --> 1:04:54.879
You can't do this.

1:05:02.698 --> 1:05:04.859
<i>Five, seven, and nine clear.</i>

1:05:06.369 --> 1:05:07.700
<i>It's a go.</i>

1:05:17.046 --> 1:05:18.411
<i>We're clear over here.</i>

1:05:29.558 --> 1:05:31.116
What'd you see?

1:05:32.428 --> 1:05:34.692
They're prepping the Gamma-13.

1:05:41.637 --> 1:05:43.867
Miss Holloway will stop them,

1:05:43.940 --> 1:05:45.305
won't she?

1:05:45.541 --> 1:05:47.304
I don't know, Cindy.

1:05:48.911 --> 1:05:50.079
I don't know.

1:05:58.487 --> 1:06:00.250
Well, I'm...

1:06:01.557 --> 1:06:03.354
I'm afraid it's time.

1:06:07.763 --> 1:06:10.095
I'm so sorry about this. Truly.

1:06:10.299 --> 1:06:12.597
It's okay. We're used to being used.

1:06:12.668 --> 1:06:15.762
I know there's nothing I can do
to make this up to you,

1:06:15.838 --> 1:06:17.533
except possibly...

1:06:24.780 --> 1:06:26.008
Tucker.

1:06:31.420 --> 1:06:34.048
- That was awesome.
- Come on, let's go.

1:06:45.798 --> 1:06:47.925
Can I help you, Miss Jones?

1:06:50.670 --> 1:06:52.661
Put me down, Miss Jones.

1:06:56.676 --> 1:06:58.701
Man, that is so hot.

1:06:58.945 --> 1:07:00.435
You think so?

1:07:02.515 --> 1:07:05.245
- Hey, not bad. Nice work.
- Thanks.

1:07:05.985 --> 1:07:07.646
<i>Hasta luego,</i> man.

1:07:08.421 --> 1:07:10.218
I'll check this one.

1:07:10.857 --> 1:07:11.983
I think he's...

1:07:12.058 --> 1:07:13.821
- Where is he?
- I think he's over here.

1:07:13.893 --> 1:07:15.884
No. No. He's right here.

1:07:16.896 --> 1:07:20.229
Hey. Somebody call for a rescue party
with extra cheese?

1:07:20.566 --> 1:07:22.796
Hey, it's about time. Open the door.

1:07:22.869 --> 1:07:24.598
You want to do the honors?

1:07:28.107 --> 1:07:30.166
Hey, maybe something like,

1:07:30.443 --> 1:07:34.709
"Stand back. We're going to break
the door down" could have been tossed out.

1:07:39.385 --> 1:07:43.651
You know there's a little green button
to the left that says, "Open"?

1:07:44.991 --> 1:07:46.822
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1:07:46.893 --> 1:07:50.385
- Wait. Why is she here?
- No, it's cool. She's one of us.

1:07:50.463 --> 1:07:52.658
- What do you mean, she's one of us?
- She blows.

1:07:52.732 --> 1:07:54.757
- Yeah.
- No, I mean she blows.

1:07:54.834 --> 1:07:56.529
Come on. Show him.

1:08:06.279 --> 1:08:07.405
So...

1:08:07.914 --> 1:08:09.541
So you've got powers?

1:08:09.615 --> 1:08:13.449
Remember I was kind of a weird child?
That's why I came here.

1:08:13.786 --> 1:08:15.117
Why didn't you say something?

1:08:15.187 --> 1:08:17.382
This is, like, great news.
You're like part of the family.

1:08:17.456 --> 1:08:20.448
- Dudes. Escape, remember?
- Right. Let's go.

1:08:23.129 --> 1:08:26.929
I want this done as fast and
efficiently as possible. Highest levels.

1:08:26.999 --> 1:08:28.296
Yes, sir.

1:08:28.501 --> 1:08:29.934
What's that?

1:08:30.303 --> 1:08:31.668
What's happening?

1:08:34.173 --> 1:08:36.733
Dylan. Open it up.

1:08:44.984 --> 1:08:48.715
- What are you doing?
- I'm saving the day. That's what I do.

1:08:50.222 --> 1:08:52.349
Summer, get us out of here.

1:08:58.030 --> 1:08:59.725
This is all wrong.

1:09:04.770 --> 1:09:06.465
This goes there

1:09:06.539 --> 1:09:09.201
and that, there.

1:09:10.076 --> 1:09:11.976
Hey, Dylan, get inside.

1:09:13.245 --> 1:09:14.644
Get inside.

1:09:18.517 --> 1:09:20.576
Shut the hangar doors.

1:09:21.320 --> 1:09:23.618
Shut the hangar doors.

1:09:26.792 --> 1:09:27.884
Oh, boy.

1:09:30.963 --> 1:09:32.191
Summer.

1:09:35.968 --> 1:09:37.868
- We're hot to go.
- Yes.

1:09:39.639 --> 1:09:41.004
What about Jack?

1:09:56.355 --> 1:09:59.017
<i>T-minus 10 minutes.</i>

1:10:08.634 --> 1:10:11.262
<i>You got to drop me off here</i>
<i>and take the kids someplace safe.</i>

1:10:11.337 --> 1:10:13.532
- We're not leaving you.
- Well, then, wait here.

1:10:13.606 --> 1:10:15.870
At least do that. Wait for me.
Let me talk to my brother.

1:10:15.941 --> 1:10:17.135
This is between him and me.

1:10:17.209 --> 1:10:18.471
But we're family.

1:10:18.544 --> 1:10:21.012
Believe me. I know what I'm doing.

1:10:26.452 --> 1:10:28.352
I know what I'm doing.

1:10:30.256 --> 1:10:32.156
Yeah.

1:10:41.133 --> 1:10:43.294
What am I doing?

1:10:46.172 --> 1:10:48.640
Mr. Pibb, Jack's out there all alone.

1:10:48.708 --> 1:10:51.836
He needs our help.
Will you distract Concussion?

1:10:52.111 --> 1:10:53.339
Please?

1:11:14.633 --> 1:11:15.827
Connor.

1:11:18.104 --> 1:11:19.799
My God, it is you.

1:11:20.906 --> 1:11:23.500
Connor, it's me, Jack. It's Jack.

1:11:24.310 --> 1:11:26.335
Nobody wants to fight you.

1:11:27.246 --> 1:11:29.043
I just want to talk.

1:11:33.486 --> 1:11:34.578
Wow.

1:11:35.621 --> 1:11:37.612
- You got old, little brother.
- Yeah.

1:11:37.690 --> 1:11:40.659
Well, I guess I didn't have the advantage of

1:11:40.726 --> 1:11:43.286
living large in some dimensional rift
where I don't age...

1:11:43.362 --> 1:11:45.728
Living large? Try alone.

1:11:45.931 --> 1:11:48.491
Conscious only of being betrayed by you
in that living hell.

1:11:48.567 --> 1:11:49.932
Betrayed? You took out the whole team.

1:11:50.002 --> 1:11:52.903
You shouldn't have tried to stop me, Jackie.

1:11:52.972 --> 1:11:54.200
Jackie?

1:11:54.840 --> 1:11:57.832
What did Mom tell you
about calling me Jackie?

1:12:06.519 --> 1:12:08.077
That was good.

1:12:08.154 --> 1:12:10.554
Boy, that... That smarts.

1:12:13.926 --> 1:12:16.793
Well, you certainly haven't
lost your touch, brother.

1:12:16.862 --> 1:12:18.796
Have you lost your powers, Jack?

1:12:18.864 --> 1:12:20.092
Well...

1:12:34.079 --> 1:12:36.343
You've got to stop doing that.

1:12:38.150 --> 1:12:40.516
You have lost your powers, Jack.

1:12:40.653 --> 1:12:43.520
Boy. Hey, are those new boots?

1:12:44.190 --> 1:12:48.786
When you say lost my powers,
I think if I really looked, I could find them.

1:12:53.566 --> 1:12:56.126
This is even better than I expected.

1:13:00.306 --> 1:13:03.036
Load up the sonic net and prepare to fire.

1:13:05.377 --> 1:13:08.540
This is it, Jack. I've waited 30 years for this.

1:13:13.118 --> 1:13:14.244
Pibb?

1:13:15.421 --> 1:13:16.547
Pibb?

1:13:16.722 --> 1:13:20.749
Wow. They must have really dragged you
out of the mothballs, huh?

1:13:26.465 --> 1:13:27.659
Steady.

1:13:29.201 --> 1:13:31.863
Well, hope you got an army behind you.

1:13:38.577 --> 1:13:40.704
Or a tiny girl in pigtails.

1:13:41.614 --> 1:13:43.206
What is this, "Attack of the Pre-schoolers"?

1:13:43.282 --> 1:13:45.648
These kids, they don't know what they're
doing, Connor. This is between you and me.

1:13:45.718 --> 1:13:47.379
- So this is the new team, huh?
- Cindy, go back.

1:13:47.453 --> 1:13:51.184
You just run up to the big bad guy
all willy-nilly now? Is that how it goes?

1:13:51.257 --> 1:13:52.383
Fire.

1:14:01.467 --> 1:14:03.662
- Cindy, run.
- No, no.

1:14:03.736 --> 1:14:04.725
Zoom!

1:14:11.610 --> 1:14:13.407
Cindy, are you okay?

1:14:13.779 --> 1:14:17.340
Cindy, you're safe now.
You're okay. It's me. It's Jack.

1:14:17.416 --> 1:14:19.714
Please, Cindy, don't do this to me.

1:14:19.785 --> 1:14:22.345
You're all right. Come on, Princess.

1:14:24.857 --> 1:14:27.052
Princess? That's me.

1:14:28.661 --> 1:14:31.152
Mr. Shepard, you moved so fast.

1:14:34.767 --> 1:14:36.200
Yes, I did.

1:14:41.907 --> 1:14:44.637
I knew it.
I knew you hadn't lost your powers.

1:14:44.710 --> 1:14:46.871
Guess I just needed a reason to use them.

1:14:46.946 --> 1:14:49.414
Jack, I'm sorry. You were right, man.
We weren't ready.

1:14:49.481 --> 1:14:51.915
Yeah, yeah. Come on.
You read the comic books.

1:14:51.984 --> 1:14:54.714
Superhero secret, first plan never works.

1:14:54.787 --> 1:14:57.153
<i>Is that it? Is that all you got?</i>

1:14:57.556 --> 1:14:59.649
Not by a long shot, sonny-boy.

1:15:02.561 --> 1:15:05.052
Stand back. No, no, no.
Everybody, get back.

1:15:06.799 --> 1:15:09.734
Load up the second net and prepare to fire.

1:15:09.802 --> 1:15:11.997
That's a fantastic idea, sir.

1:15:12.071 --> 1:15:13.971
I wish we had a second net.

1:15:14.039 --> 1:15:16.667
Why, you fumbling, bumbling bozo.

1:15:27.286 --> 1:15:30.380
Okay, all right. You guys, wait right here.

1:15:30.723 --> 1:15:33.453
I'll be back in a second, give or take.

1:16:03.389 --> 1:16:05.084
Just like riding a bike.

1:16:13.565 --> 1:16:16.762
Is that it?
Is there anyone else who can face me?

1:16:17.002 --> 1:16:21.268
- I'm still standing here, you little twerp.
- Sir, I wouldn't do that.

1:16:23.475 --> 1:16:25.136
What's that sound?

1:16:27.846 --> 1:16:29.677
- Hey, it's...
- Jackie.

1:16:35.220 --> 1:16:36.517
Actually,

1:16:37.423 --> 1:16:38.754
it's Zoom.

1:16:38.991 --> 1:16:41.755
- Suit looks good.
- Nice suit, lizard-boy.

1:16:45.998 --> 1:16:47.625
Let's play ball.

1:17:01.580 --> 1:17:03.343
- Zoom.
- Hey.

1:17:06.819 --> 1:17:10.311
Hey, Connor.
You kind of suck at this, don't you, dude?

1:17:38.684 --> 1:17:40.811
Oh, no. He's going to miss.

1:17:53.799 --> 1:17:57.132
Zoom. We have a chance to save him.

1:17:57.769 --> 1:18:00.169
You must close the vortex.

1:18:01.106 --> 1:18:03.574
Must save Connor.

1:18:25.764 --> 1:18:27.698
No.

1:18:32.671 --> 1:18:33.899
Connor.

1:18:52.958 --> 1:18:55.791
Connor, the vortex worked this time.

1:18:56.995 --> 1:18:59.725
Maybe you can use your powers for good.

1:19:01.733 --> 1:19:02.961
I'm sorry, Jack.

1:19:03.035 --> 1:19:05.799
Give your little brother a hug. Come on.

1:19:06.038 --> 1:19:07.938
Yeah. I got my brother back.

1:19:08.006 --> 1:19:10.133
- We did it.
- Now that's what I call teamwork.

1:19:10.209 --> 1:19:12.973
This is Connor. This is Dylan. Come on.

1:19:13.111 --> 1:19:15.443
Welcome to the family, brother.

1:19:16.181 --> 1:19:17.273
This is Marsha.

1:19:17.349 --> 1:19:18.907
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

1:19:18.984 --> 1:19:21.009
- Hi. What's your name?
- Cindy.

1:19:21.153 --> 1:19:22.381
- Cindy.
- Hey. Summer.

1:19:23.989 --> 1:19:26.617
- I'm Tucker. How's it going?
- Tucker, hi.

1:19:28.560 --> 1:19:30.323
Somebody's going to have to drive
on the way back. We've got the...

1:19:30.395 --> 1:19:31.953
Can I? Can I drive?

1:19:32.030 --> 1:19:33.759
- Can she drive?
- Yeah, she can drive.

1:19:33.832 --> 1:19:36.164
We got the FE-12 running again.
Remember the old saucer from back then?

1:19:36.235 --> 1:19:38.669
Oh, yeah. Where is it? Out there? Oh, yeah.

1:19:39.137 --> 1:19:40.661
Hold it, Zoom.

1:19:45.978 --> 1:19:47.070
What?

1:19:48.146 --> 1:19:49.807
What are you going to do now?

1:19:49.881 --> 1:19:53.078
You know us heroes.
We always do the right thing.

1:19:54.686 --> 1:19:57.154
Come on, Grant. We got work to do.

1:20:06.431 --> 1:20:10.492
Rapunzel, Rapunzel, let down your hair.

1:20:10.836 --> 1:20:12.736
It's Princess Rapunzel.

1:20:12.904 --> 1:20:14.166
Whatever.

1:20:35.527 --> 1:20:36.653
Whoa.

1:20:38.196 --> 1:20:39.561
My prince.

1:20:46.104 --> 1:20:47.867
That's my Princess.

1:21:30.849 --> 1:21:32.043
Ready.

1:21:32.984 --> 1:21:34.246
Go, red.

1:21:34.786 --> 1:21:37.482
Go, white. Go, red.

1:21:38.256 --> 1:21:40.349
Fight. Fight. Fight.

1:22:27.272 --> 1:22:31.038
<i>And so, Zoom was reunited with his brother</i>

1:22:31.610 --> 1:22:33.510
<i>and a new Zenith team.</i>

1:22:34.780 --> 1:22:36.748
<i>But they were more than a team.</i>

1:22:36.815 --> 1:22:38.749
<i>They were a family.</i>

1:22:40.118 --> 1:22:41.881
<i>Team Zenith.</i>

1:22:56.401 --> 1:22:57.595
Marker.

1:22:57.669 --> 1:22:58.966
I'll try one time bigger.

1:22:59.037 --> 1:23:00.868
- No, I'm kidding.
- I'm kidding, I got it.

1:23:00.939 --> 1:23:03.066
I'm quicker than you think.

1:23:05.143 --> 1:23:07.634
We're funnier on TV.
Maybe it's the screen size.

1:23:07.712 --> 1:23:09.612
- If you went like this.
- Rolling.

1:23:09.681 --> 1:23:12.514
<i>We like to poo in our pants</i>

1:23:13.051 --> 1:23:14.780
<i>We like to poo in our pants</i>

1:23:14.853 --> 1:23:16.616
That's not in the script.

1:23:17.689 --> 1:23:19.714
Look, dude, I don't know.

1:23:23.161 --> 1:23:27.029
- I apologize.
- No, I want to do it just like that.

1:23:27.532 --> 1:23:29.227
These... Have a sensitive condition?

1:23:29.301 --> 1:23:31.360
Who knows? You're the one
who's supposed to say the stuff.

1:23:31.436 --> 1:23:34.405
You're the one on camera.
Who cares about me? Shut up. I'll do it.

1:23:34.473 --> 1:23:36.566
These children have a... Are in a...

1:23:36.641 --> 1:23:38.302
All right. Sorry.

1:23:40.378 --> 1:23:44.576
And you want these little lunatics
to be like me?

1:23:46.885 --> 1:23:48.648
Now I've forgotten exactly what to say

1:23:48.720 --> 1:23:51.245
because I was so in love with Courteney
for just a moment.

1:23:51.323 --> 1:23:52.483
Where's Matt LeBlanc?

1:23:52.557 --> 1:23:53.615
Everybody.

1:23:53.792 --> 1:23:56.420
<i>We like to poo in our pants</i>

1:23:56.928 --> 1:23:59.863
<i>We like to poo in our pants</i>
