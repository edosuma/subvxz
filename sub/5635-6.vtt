FROND: <i>Louise Belcher.</i>

00:21.252 --> 00:22.551
Phillip Frond.

00:22.586 --> 00:24.086
So, you're in trouble again.

00:24.121 --> 00:25.721
Drink some cranberry juice.

00:25.756 --> 00:27.157
What? No.
Not <i> urine</i> trouble.

00:27.158 --> 00:28.924
You are in trouble!

00:28.959 --> 00:30.760
This is the third item
you've brought this week

00:30.761 --> 00:32.262
that's disrupted school.

00:32.262 --> 00:33.929
First, it was the fake eyeball.

00:33.964 --> 00:35.365
<i>Aah!</i>

00:35.366 --> 00:36.632
(screaming) (screaming)

00:36.667 --> 00:38.268
Then it was the piñata.

00:38.269 --> 00:40.469
Tator-tot-a-piñata!

00:40.504 --> 00:41.770
And now the grabber.

00:41.805 --> 00:43.071
This goes over here.
Stop it.

00:43.107 --> 00:44.507
And this goes over here.
Stop it, Louise.

00:44.508 --> 00:46.341
And this will be easier over here.
Stop it!

00:46.377 --> 00:49.178
You have clearly violated
the "three gag items and you're out"

00:49.213 --> 00:51.513
rule, so I'm going to have to
give you... detention. Detention?

00:51.549 --> 00:52.882
Sure. Worth it.
Now I'll just take

00:52.883 --> 00:54.616
my grabber back, and...
Ah, ah, ah!

00:54.652 --> 00:56.952
Also, there's someone here
who wants to talk to you.

00:56.987 --> 00:59.122
There is?
Yes.

00:59.123 --> 01:01.323
(high-pitched Italian accent): Me.
Distracts-His-Friendzo-Lorenzo.

01:01.358 --> 01:04.092
Oh, no.
Why do I disrupt-a everything?

01:04.128 --> 01:05.795
Jeez, where do you get
these dolls?

01:05.796 --> 01:08.463
The Super Weird
Therapy Doll Outlet?

01:08.499 --> 01:10.567
(normal voice):
Hey, I made him. I knitted him.

01:10.568 --> 01:12.100
(Italian accent):
You watch-a your mouth.

01:12.136 --> 01:14.571
Okay, well,
I'm just gonna take my grabber,

01:14.572 --> 01:16.104
and I'll see you in detention.

01:16.140 --> 01:18.007
No, no, no, no, not-a so fast!

01:18.008 --> 01:19.709
(normal voice): You think
I'm just gonna give this back to you

01:19.710 --> 01:20.877
so you can distract
more students?

01:20.878 --> 01:22.579
Uh-uh, sister.

01:22.580 --> 01:24.547
This is going into my satchel.
I'm taking it home.

01:24.548 --> 01:27.417
What?! Oh, no, it isn't
going in your satchel.

01:27.418 --> 01:28.985
(Italian accent):
Going in-a the satchel.

01:28.986 --> 01:30.819
<i>Not</i> going in the satchel.

01:30.854 --> 01:32.788
One-way ticket
to-a satchel town.

01:32.823 --> 01:34.557
No, round-trip ticket
back to my hand!

01:34.558 --> 01:36.391
(grunting)
Hope it had fun. (grunts)

01:36.427 --> 01:39.127
And... satcheled!

01:39.163 --> 01:41.463
No!

01:41.498 --> 01:42.798
Gene, can I practice

01:42.833 --> 01:44.334
my Spanish with you?

01:44.335 --> 01:46.069
<i>¿Como estas?
Me llamo Tina.</i>

01:46.070 --> 01:47.469
Sounds great.
You did it.

01:47.504 --> 01:49.371
Hey, Louise.
You're home late.

01:49.406 --> 01:51.541
You get detention? Yes!
But that's not the point.

01:51.542 --> 01:53.710
Frond took my Abumi-guchi
grabber home with him!

01:53.711 --> 01:55.078
He stole it!

01:55.079 --> 01:56.679
Louise, I told you

01:56.680 --> 01:58.514
bringing that grabber
to school was a bad idea.

01:58.515 --> 02:00.049
<i>Es no bueno.</i>
Cheer up, Louise.

02:00.050 --> 02:01.750
It's Friday. Let's do shots!

02:01.785 --> 02:03.953
Hey, who's got crazy
weekend plans?

02:03.954 --> 02:06.589
Well, tonight we're having
my sister Gayle over for dinner.

02:06.590 --> 02:08.358
She's got some new mystery man,

02:08.359 --> 02:10.259
(singsongy): and things
are getting serious.

02:10.261 --> 02:12.629
Wow. Spicy.
How long they been dating?

02:12.630 --> 02:14.396
This will be
their second date. Oh.

02:14.431 --> 02:16.466
Yeah. Longest relationship
Gayle's ever had.

02:16.467 --> 02:19.001
So, uh, that's everyone
who's coming. Yup.

02:19.036 --> 02:20.470
Nu-uh! Dad's bringing
a date, too.

02:20.471 --> 02:22.404
His name is Steve,
and he's a boy.

02:22.439 --> 02:24.073
Gene, hush!
Steve? Bob invited Steve?

02:24.074 --> 02:26.209
The guy who was in here
the other day?

02:26.210 --> 02:27.576
Mr. Interesting?!

02:27.611 --> 02:29.045
Wow, that's interesting.

02:29.046 --> 02:30.345
(muffled grunting)

02:30.381 --> 02:32.282
(whistling)

02:32.283 --> 02:34.449
(singsongy): I'm very excited
about this standing rib roast.

02:34.485 --> 02:36.551
Does everything have to
be about your wiener?!

02:36.587 --> 02:37.987
(quietly):
He knows. Bob, he knows.

02:37.988 --> 02:39.422
What?
So, Bob, Steve?

02:39.423 --> 02:40.456
Huh? Steve. Little dinner party?

02:40.457 --> 02:42.224
Yes.
Yeah.

02:42.259 --> 02:44.060
TEDDY: Right. Yeah.
Well, he's recently divorced

02:44.061 --> 02:46.541
and probably looking to meet new
people, so I invited him over.

02:46.563 --> 02:48.797
Yeah, yeah, I-I'm divorced.
Everyone's divorced!

02:48.832 --> 02:50.232
Well, also, he's
an archeologist.

02:50.267 --> 02:52.101
Oh, really?
Yeah. Like Indiana Jones.

02:52.102 --> 02:53.902
So I'll be friends
with Indiana Jones.

02:53.937 --> 02:56.071
Man crush.
Man crush!

02:56.106 --> 02:57.205
It's not a man crush.

02:57.241 --> 02:58.608
I think it's nice

02:58.609 --> 03:00.109
Dad is making a new friend.
Do you, Tina?!

03:00.110 --> 03:02.245
Yes.
Sorry. What I meant to say is,

03:02.246 --> 03:04.046
I currently have
no plans tonight.

03:04.081 --> 03:05.114
That can't be right.

03:05.115 --> 03:06.649
Oh. Well, Teddy, I mean,

03:06.650 --> 03:08.451
Steve's bringing his
son, so, you know,

03:08.452 --> 03:10.319
it's gonna be, like,
a boring, family-type thing.

03:10.354 --> 03:11.821
Son? What son?
How old is he?

03:11.822 --> 03:13.088
Here, draw his body type. Go.

03:13.123 --> 03:14.991
You know what?
I just remembered.

03:14.992 --> 03:17.460
I <i> do</i> have plans tonight,
with... Charlie from the union.

03:17.461 --> 03:18.994
And he's pretty cool, too.

03:19.029 --> 03:20.496
That's... good.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

03:20.497 --> 03:22.031
I think he's calling
right now. Charlie.

03:22.032 --> 03:23.433
Teddy.
What's that?

03:23.434 --> 03:25.101
(laughing)

03:25.102 --> 03:27.736
Teddy.
Bobby, can you please hold on?

03:27.771 --> 03:29.438
I'm sorry. Your phone didn't ring.
Dang, I'm on the phone!

03:29.473 --> 03:30.572
Right, right, right. Okay.

03:30.607 --> 03:32.041
Really?

03:32.042 --> 03:34.177
(laughing loudly)

03:34.178 --> 03:37.295
Oh.

03:37.314 --> 03:38.781
Ugh, these forks are dumb.

03:38.782 --> 03:40.183
They look dumb.
Why did we buy these?

03:40.184 --> 03:42.217
(doorbell rings)
Oh, my God, it might be him!

03:42.986 --> 03:44.153
Hello!

03:44.154 --> 03:46.188
Oh, it's just Gayle, everyone.

03:46.223 --> 03:47.490
Okay.

03:47.491 --> 03:49.191
So, where's the mystery man?

03:49.226 --> 03:50.727
Oh, he's running a little late.

03:50.728 --> 03:52.328
He got held up at work.

03:52.329 --> 03:54.397
Or maybe he's dead!
Oh, God, he's dead!

03:54.398 --> 03:56.866
Okay, okay, calm down.
(panting)

03:56.867 --> 03:59.801
It's just, I've never been
on a second date before

03:59.837 --> 04:01.704
that the other
person knew about.

04:01.705 --> 04:04.240
Oh! Why did he say yes?
Is he gonna rob me?

04:04.241 --> 04:06.843
He's going on a second date
'cause he likes you.

04:06.844 --> 04:08.711
Do you like him?
I think so.

04:08.712 --> 04:10.747
I mean, he checks
a lot of my boxes.

04:10.748 --> 04:14.182
He's a man, he's got a face,
he can go outside.

04:14.218 --> 04:16.552
Lock him down!
I just wish there was a way

04:16.553 --> 04:19.589
I could know for sure
that we were meant to be together.

04:19.589 --> 04:22.024
Like a sign.
A sign? Like what?

04:22.024 --> 04:23.760
Oh, you know, the usual.

04:23.761 --> 04:26.829
Like if we both got struck
by lightning at the same time,

04:26.830 --> 04:31.166
or if an eagle landed on his
hand and whispered my name.

04:31.201 --> 04:32.634
Yeah, that's how
you know it's real.

04:32.669 --> 04:34.370
(gasps) Or if he made me a gift.

04:34.371 --> 04:36.272
Like, Linda, when we were kids,

04:36.273 --> 04:38.608
Alfie Constanelli
made a portrait of you

04:38.609 --> 04:41.209
out of his own
hair and toenails.

04:41.245 --> 04:42.879
Ew. Yeah. (doorbell rings)

04:42.880 --> 04:45.248
I'll get it! Aah!
It might be him! Hide me!

04:45.249 --> 04:47.716
Wait. Don't hide me.
Give me a makeover, quick!

04:47.751 --> 04:50.585
Everyone, this is Steve. Hello.

04:50.621 --> 04:52.355
I'm Gayle, and I'm on a date!
Oh, okay.

04:52.356 --> 04:54.090
He'll be here any minute!
All-all right.

04:54.091 --> 04:56.459
He smells like pencils!
Thank you, Gayle.

04:56.460 --> 04:58.361
These are my kids
Gene, Louise, and Tina.

04:58.362 --> 05:00.229
They're okay
after you get to know them.

05:00.230 --> 05:02.864
Nice to meet all of you.
This is my son...

05:02.900 --> 05:05.000
TINA: <i>Teenage boy with it going on.
Teenage boy with it going on.</i>

05:05.035 --> 05:06.668
Zander.
Greetings.

05:06.703 --> 05:09.037
Huh. You're, um...
So, that's you.

05:09.072 --> 05:11.940
Hell-o.
Chitty chitty bangs bangs.

05:11.975 --> 05:13.943
So, uh, Steve, do you want...
you want something to drink?

05:13.944 --> 05:15.378
Do you want wine? We have wine.

05:15.379 --> 05:16.779
I-I bought it.
Okay.

05:16.780 --> 05:18.214
It was sort of expensive.
It is wine.

05:18.215 --> 05:19.582
Easy, Bob. Bob.
Mm-hmm. Sure.

05:19.583 --> 05:20.983
Yeah. Yeah.
E... Easy.

05:20.984 --> 05:22.350
Yeah, yeah. Okay.
Take it down a notch.

05:22.386 --> 05:23.886
Take it down a notch.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

05:23.887 --> 05:25.321
It's, uh, nice to
have you over, Steve!

05:25.322 --> 05:26.823
Well, I'm just trying
to get back out there

05:26.824 --> 05:28.558
and make new friends
after the divorce.

05:28.559 --> 05:30.326
That's also the title
of the book I'm reading.

05:30.327 --> 05:32.561
<i>Get Back Out There and Make
New Friends After the Divorce.</i>

05:32.596 --> 05:34.430
Oh, that sounds good.
What's it... about?

05:34.431 --> 05:35.864
Never mind.
(doorbell rings)

05:35.899 --> 05:37.365
(gasps) That's got to be him!

05:37.401 --> 05:40.802
Phillip!
Oh, no. No, no, no, no.

05:40.838 --> 05:43.605
BOB and LINDA: Oh, my God.
(Louise screaming)

05:45.132 --> 05:46.832
Hi, Mr. Frond.
Uh...

05:46.833 --> 05:49.535
This is the guy, Aunt Gayle?
<i>This</i> is the guy?!

05:49.536 --> 05:51.337
Wait. You all know each other?

05:51.338 --> 05:53.839
Um, Louise,
Gene and Tina are students

05:53.840 --> 05:55.373
at the school where I counsel.

05:55.409 --> 05:56.876
Yeah, you know what?
Let me just get the door here.

05:56.877 --> 05:58.844
Just... gonna...
Uh... Ow!

05:58.845 --> 06:00.246
...close this thing. Hey.
Ow, my foot's caught in it.

06:00.247 --> 06:01.647
Let go of it!
My house!

06:01.648 --> 06:03.481
Ow!
My home!

06:03.517 --> 06:06.718
Okay, I know Mr. Frond isn't
exactly our favorite person.

06:06.753 --> 06:08.187
Great talk.
Now let's kick him out.

06:08.188 --> 06:09.655
Dad, get the broom.

06:09.656 --> 06:11.223
Hey! We are not
gonna ruin this for Gayle!

06:11.224 --> 06:12.692
(groaning) She needs this!

06:12.693 --> 06:14.827
She is one cat death away
from moving in with us!

06:14.828 --> 06:16.929
Your mom's right. We can't
ruin this for Gayle.

06:16.930 --> 06:19.598
Yes! But more importantly,
we can't ruin this for me.

06:19.599 --> 06:21.701
This dinner party
will proceed smoothly!

06:21.702 --> 06:23.602
I believe in you, Dad.
You're a great entertainer.

06:23.603 --> 06:25.237
Like a sweaty Martha Stewart.

06:25.238 --> 06:27.907
Can we talk about the game
plan for the rib roast?

06:27.908 --> 06:29.608
It-it'll be
a little while, Gene.

06:29.609 --> 06:31.711
I'll take my half now,
whatever state it's in.

06:31.712 --> 06:33.379
It's not cooked, Gene. It's raw.

06:33.380 --> 06:35.047
I do not mind.

06:35.048 --> 06:37.717
Anyway, just so we're clear,
do not mess this date up!

06:37.718 --> 06:39.350
Fine.

06:39.386 --> 06:41.220
Secret post-meeting kid meeting.

06:41.221 --> 06:44.023
We got to mess this date up.
But, Louise,

06:44.024 --> 06:45.891
even though
Mr. Frond gives us detention

06:45.892 --> 06:48.027
all the time and is awful,
that doesn't mean he won't make

06:48.028 --> 06:49.861
a great guidance counselor,
slash, uncle some day.

06:49.896 --> 06:51.897
Ugh! Tina!

06:51.898 --> 06:53.599
Don't you speak those words!

06:53.600 --> 06:55.600
Uncle Frond? Sick!

06:55.635 --> 06:57.303
Our lives would be
so intertwined.

06:57.304 --> 06:59.872
And the dolls. God, the dolls!

06:59.873 --> 07:02.775
(high-pitched): Yay...!

07:02.776 --> 07:04.276
Aah! It's a nightmare!

07:04.277 --> 07:05.945
Those dolls
would be our cousins!

07:05.946 --> 07:08.114
Gene gets it. Tina, you in?

07:08.115 --> 07:10.049
Uh... Okay.

07:10.050 --> 07:11.584
Good. Now let's talk strategy.

07:11.585 --> 07:13.152
We got to be subtle.

07:13.153 --> 07:14.887
So, should we convince
Aunt Gayle

07:14.888 --> 07:16.722
that Frond's in the Mafia,
or that he is a witch?

07:16.723 --> 07:18.757
Mafia witch!
Nice!

07:19.993 --> 07:21.727
Well, this is fun!

07:21.728 --> 07:23.128
<i>So</i> fun.

07:23.163 --> 07:24.429
So fun.

07:24.464 --> 07:26.265
You know, I'm only ten,

07:26.266 --> 07:28.467
but I'm a very mature ten.

07:28.468 --> 07:30.069
That's... nice.

07:30.070 --> 07:31.270
In the lips.

07:31.271 --> 07:32.471
(lips smacking)

07:32.472 --> 07:35.441
Oh, um... I have
to go help my dad.

07:35.442 --> 07:36.976
Um, I think I smell something,

07:36.977 --> 07:37.976
um, spilling.

07:38.011 --> 07:39.644
Ugh. Damn.

07:39.679 --> 07:41.580
Back again.
Hmm.

07:41.581 --> 07:42.982
Well, I checked
on the rib roast.

07:42.983 --> 07:44.617
Still gonna be a while.
(Gene grunts)

07:44.618 --> 07:46.485
But that just gives us
more time to talk!

07:46.486 --> 07:48.587
So, Steve, Mr. Archeologist,

07:48.588 --> 07:51.290
is life for you just like
one long Indiana Jones movie?

07:51.291 --> 07:53.459
(laughs)
You know, I get that a lot.

07:53.460 --> 07:55.161
It's... not like that at all.

07:55.162 --> 07:56.661
Right. Right.

07:56.696 --> 07:58.597
I'm sorry, but that movie is
to archeology

07:58.598 --> 08:00.866
what <i> Pretty Woman</i> is
to prostitution.

08:00.867 --> 08:03.002
Who was a prostitute
in <i> Pretty Woman?</i>

08:03.003 --> 08:04.336
They all were, honey!

08:04.337 --> 08:05.704
Oh.

08:05.705 --> 08:07.373
Hey, how about some
more wine, huh?

08:07.374 --> 08:09.141
Ha! Mr. Frond, you
haven't touched yours.

08:09.142 --> 08:11.477
Oh, I-I'm not really
much of a drinker.

08:11.478 --> 08:13.379
(grunting) Okay, okay, okay, okay.
There he goes.

08:13.380 --> 08:15.014
So, how'd you two meet, huh?

08:15.015 --> 08:17.149
Phillip and I go
to the same cat salon.

08:17.150 --> 08:18.783
Ooh.

08:18.819 --> 08:22.321
I took Dr. BoJangles in for
a blowout, and there she was.

08:22.322 --> 08:25.658
That's funny,
coming from a Mafia witch! A what?

08:25.659 --> 08:28.127
It's a witch that's in the Mafia.
Don't play dumb.

08:28.128 --> 08:29.695
(quietly):
Abort. Abort. Not working.

08:29.696 --> 08:31.130
I'm pretty sure they bought it.

08:31.131 --> 08:32.731
Let me handle this.

08:32.732 --> 08:35.801
So, Aunt Gayle, Phillip here
is a real rule hound.

08:35.802 --> 08:37.369
Aren't rules the worst?

08:37.370 --> 08:38.871
Yuck, right?

08:38.871 --> 08:40.306
No, I love rules!

08:40.307 --> 08:42.374
I make 'em up for
myself all the time.

08:42.375 --> 08:44.343
Like every time
I eat a ham sandwich,

08:44.344 --> 08:46.645
I have to send $100 to a pig.

08:46.646 --> 08:49.081
Or if I stay up all
night, I won't die.

08:49.082 --> 08:50.516
Your rules rule.

08:50.517 --> 08:52.084
(laughing): Oh, Phillip!

08:52.085 --> 08:53.853
Hmm.
(Louise grunts)

08:53.854 --> 08:55.654
Steve, I-I don't think all
archeologists are Indiana Jones.

08:55.655 --> 08:57.489
So, Phillip, what is it
that you do at the school exactly?

08:57.490 --> 08:58.891
I-I... Sorry.
What? No, you-you go. What?

08:58.892 --> 09:00.559
Go ahead. No, I... I...

09:00.560 --> 09:02.027
Did you want to say something?
I... I didn't mean...

09:02.028 --> 09:03.461
Phillip, what was it you
were saying? Forget it.

09:03.496 --> 09:04.930
I am a guidance counselor,

09:04.931 --> 09:06.865
but I prefer the term
"Emotion Coach." Oh.

09:06.900 --> 09:08.500
You know, Zander's
received some counseling

09:08.501 --> 09:10.269
since my wife and I separated.

09:10.270 --> 09:13.905
We've run into a few problems
that rhyme with schleptomaniac.

09:13.940 --> 09:16.207
I'm not a kleptomaniac!
Where'd my coaster go?

09:16.243 --> 09:18.277
Divorce is very hard
for kids Zander's age.

09:18.278 --> 09:20.379
I will often do
divorce counseling

09:20.380 --> 09:22.381
for kids whose parents
<i>aren't</i> divorced,

09:22.382 --> 09:24.516
'cause, you know, I can
tell who's not gonna make it.

09:24.517 --> 09:28.120
So, Mr. Frond, is it true
that you've got a monkey butt?!

09:28.121 --> 09:29.889
I heard that.
Kids!

09:29.890 --> 09:31.857
Well, monkey butt
or no monkey butt,

09:31.858 --> 09:35.261
Phillip here is, like,
super tightly wound, Aunt Gayle.

09:35.262 --> 09:37.195
Like, so much wound.

09:37.230 --> 09:38.964
(gasps) I'm tightly wound!

09:38.965 --> 09:40.733
Sometimes I scream
into a pillow.

09:40.734 --> 09:43.235
I like to cry into a loaf of
bread while I'm eating it!

09:43.236 --> 09:44.470
Ah!

09:44.471 --> 09:45.938
(yelling) LINDA: Louise,

09:45.939 --> 09:47.706
can you please go away
and come back

09:47.707 --> 09:49.275
with a smile on your face
and no words coming out of it?

09:49.276 --> 09:51.043
Thank you!
Sure!

09:51.044 --> 09:52.244
Good. Good.
Sure.

09:52.245 --> 09:54.545
Ugh. (gasps)

09:54.581 --> 09:56.649
At least I can get
my grabber back.

09:56.650 --> 09:58.049
What the...?

09:58.084 --> 10:00.285
"Dear Gayle,
to commemorate our second date,

10:00.320 --> 10:02.488
"I made this doll
out of the yarn

10:02.489 --> 10:04.122
from my dead grandmother's
shawl."

10:04.157 --> 10:06.057
(gasps) Oh, no!

10:06.092 --> 10:07.458
GENE: What is it?

10:07.494 --> 10:09.962
I think it's supposed
to be Aunt Gayle.

10:09.963 --> 10:12.264
Well, then who's
that lady in the living room?

10:12.265 --> 10:14.632
You guys, don't you see?
He made her something!

10:14.668 --> 10:17.836
Gayle might think
this is one of her sign things!

10:17.837 --> 10:19.305
If Frond gives this
to her tonight,

10:19.306 --> 10:20.839
it could seal the deal forever!

10:20.840 --> 10:22.574
We got to hide this doll until

10:22.575 --> 10:24.476
we've successfully
broken them up.

10:24.477 --> 10:25.978
But, Louise, Aunt
Gayle and Mr. Frond

10:25.979 --> 10:27.513
are actually pretty
good for each other.

10:27.514 --> 10:29.080
They're so crazy,
they just might work.

10:29.115 --> 10:31.317
Tina, you sound ridiculous.
Now listen up.

10:31.318 --> 10:34.286
We've been targeting Frond,
but Aunt Gayle's the one

10:34.287 --> 10:35.921
that's scared of
all this dating stuff.

10:35.922 --> 10:38.791
We got to convince her
that love will destroy her.

10:38.792 --> 10:41.293
Gene, we're gonna need some
instruments. About time.

10:41.294 --> 10:43.529
Tina, you're taking Spanish now,
<i>sí?</i> What?

10:43.530 --> 10:45.430
You're taking Spanish now, yes?

10:45.465 --> 10:46.332
Oh.<i> Sí.</i>

10:46.333 --> 10:47.833
All right.

10:47.834 --> 10:50.169
Let's sing this romance
into a no-mance, people.

10:50.170 --> 10:52.004
Ugh, still not done.

10:52.005 --> 10:53.706
Hey, so things are going
pretty good out there

10:53.707 --> 10:55.006
with me and Steve, right?

10:55.041 --> 10:56.542
Uh... no.

10:56.543 --> 10:58.944
I know. I know it's bad.
I don't get it.

10:58.945 --> 11:00.879
Well, he's kind of a dud.
He's not a dud.

11:00.880 --> 11:02.448
He's an archeologist
and he's amazing.

11:02.449 --> 11:04.350
(phone vibrates) Ugh,
Teddy keeps texting me

11:04.351 --> 11:07.152
to say he didn't mean to text
me, he meant to text Charlie.

11:07.153 --> 11:08.487
Listen, Bob, I think you're just

11:08.488 --> 11:10.322
coming on a little strong
with Steve.

11:10.323 --> 11:11.991
You got to play hard to get.

11:11.992 --> 11:13.325
You think so?
Yeah.

11:13.326 --> 11:15.294
Give him a bit of a chase.
All right.

11:15.295 --> 11:16.695
I-I can do that.
That's it.

11:16.696 --> 11:18.130
You want some of this? Yeah.

11:18.131 --> 11:19.631
Well, you can't have it!
(whoops)

11:19.632 --> 11:21.633
And we all looked at each other,
and we just smiled.

11:21.634 --> 11:22.868
Wow!

11:22.869 --> 11:24.136
Was that too loud?

11:24.137 --> 11:25.738
I do not usually drink.

11:25.739 --> 11:28.140
(singsongy): But I do now!

11:28.141 --> 11:31.677
Anyway, that was the most
exciting dig of my whole career.

11:31.678 --> 11:32.978
Crap. I missed his story.

11:32.979 --> 11:34.646
Steve, what was
your most exciting dig?

11:34.647 --> 11:35.881
Oh, I was just saying that...

11:35.882 --> 11:37.149
Bob, no.
Never mind.

11:37.150 --> 11:38.350
Uh, he doesn't want to hear it.

11:38.351 --> 11:39.984
Yeah, I got my own stuff
going on.

11:40.020 --> 11:42.820
Ladies and gentlemen,
if I can have your attention.

11:42.856 --> 11:45.758
We would like to serenade all
of you tonight... What? No.

11:45.759 --> 11:49.728
...with an old Spanish ballad

and then move around?

12:50.590 --> 12:51.824
Oh. (gags)

12:51.825 --> 12:53.092

13:02.174 --> 13:03.174
He's fine.

13:03.175 --> 13:04.843
Yeah. He sounds... good.

I know this might be a bad time,
but dinner's ready,

13:07.013 --> 13:09.914
so if we could just all make
our way toward the table...

13:09.949 --> 13:10.948
FROND: You go ahead!

13:10.983 --> 13:12.684
Um, has anyone seen Zander?

13:12.685 --> 13:14.553
I didn't take anything.
Wait, what?

13:14.554 --> 13:16.787
But you took my breath away.

13:16.822 --> 13:18.990
So, we have had
a wonderful time,

13:18.991 --> 13:21.059
but we are... No-no-no-no-no!
Don't say you're gonna leave.

13:21.060 --> 13:23.194
Look, Steve,
I was acting weird before.

13:23.195 --> 13:25.030
That was Linda's dumb idea.
Hey.

13:25.031 --> 13:26.764
But I don't want
to play games with you.

13:26.799 --> 13:28.366
Aw.
Uh...

13:28.367 --> 13:30.000
So just come have
some of my rib roast.

13:30.036 --> 13:31.602
Let him go!
I'll take his!

13:31.637 --> 13:33.837

we'll stay.

13:33.873 --> 13:34.906
All right!

13:34.907 --> 13:36.541
This is a great dinner party!

13:36.542 --> 13:38.343
Phillip, keep... keep
doing your throw-ups!

13:38.344 --> 13:39.744
Come out when you're ready.

13:39.745 --> 13:41.713
Ah, ah.
Where do you think you're going?

13:41.714 --> 13:43.715
To Rib Roast Junction!
Toot toot!

13:43.716 --> 13:45.115
What did you take
from Mr. Frond?

13:45.151 --> 13:47.351
FROND: She took my dead grandma
shawl doll!

13:47.386 --> 13:49.520
Dead grandma shawl doll?
What the hell is that?

13:49.555 --> 13:51.089
It sounds weird when you say it.

13:51.090 --> 13:52.691
Oh, what's the difference?

13:52.692 --> 13:53.891
I blew it.

13:53.926 --> 13:55.927
I'm never gonna find anybody!

13:55.928 --> 13:58.228
Maybe I can knit myself a wife.

13:58.264 --> 13:59.998
You could call her Yarnessa.

13:59.999 --> 14:02.700
Louise! You are gonna give back
that doll thing right now!

14:02.735 --> 14:04.702
Okay, hear me out...
Look at my eyes.

14:04.737 --> 14:07.072
KIDS: Ah!
You see how crazy they are?

14:07.073 --> 14:09.708
Now!
(all gasp)

14:09.709 --> 14:12.009
But it was right here!
Okay, Louise.

14:12.044 --> 14:13.712
Here's what's gonna happen
if you don't produce

14:13.713 --> 14:15.412
that dead grandma doll...
whatever.

14:15.448 --> 14:17.081
You're gonna be so grounded

14:17.116 --> 14:18.416
you're gonna grow roots,
Miss Missy!

14:18.417 --> 14:20.250
Yikes! Ah! Oh, and the chores!

14:20.286 --> 14:22.053
You're gonna wash the kitchen floor,
(gasping)

14:22.054 --> 14:23.888
the bathroom floor,
the basement floor,

14:23.889 --> 14:24.889
all the floors!

14:24.890 --> 14:26.024
So many floors!

14:26.025 --> 14:27.392
Is anyone kind of excited

14:27.393 --> 14:28.892
about how clean
our house is gonna be?

14:28.928 --> 14:30.462
Mr. Frond?

14:30.463 --> 14:31.896
You ready to come out?

14:31.897 --> 14:33.698
Gayle's waiting for you.

14:33.699 --> 14:35.734
(Frond retching)

14:35.735 --> 14:37.401
Okay, he's not ready.

14:37.436 --> 14:40.105
There you go.
And a little sauce.

14:40.106 --> 14:42.840
So Mr. Frond is gonna be
a little while in the bathroom.

14:42.875 --> 14:44.542
What a cutie he is, huh?

14:44.543 --> 14:46.211
I can't get the English version

14:46.212 --> 14:47.879
of that Spanish song
out of my head.

14:47.880 --> 14:49.079
Oh, boy.

14:49.115 --> 14:50.749
Oh, my God, I'm gonna die alone!

14:50.750 --> 14:52.049
There she goes.

14:52.084 --> 14:53.918
(clears throat)
Steve, how's the food?

14:53.919 --> 14:55.420
Do you love it
or do you love it?

14:55.421 --> 14:57.122
Oof.
Oh, no, you look bad.

14:57.123 --> 14:58.657
Is there cream in this sauce?

14:58.658 --> 14:59.924
In the crème fraiche?

14:59.925 --> 15:01.692
Uh, yeah, a little bit.

15:01.727 --> 15:03.495
Okay, do you have a bathroom
without a man in it?

15:03.496 --> 15:05.296
We have one in the restaurant.
I can let you in.

15:05.297 --> 15:07.232
But here's a little rib roast
without sauce on it...

15:07.233 --> 15:08.466
No, absolutely not.
We got to move.

15:08.467 --> 15:09.734
Yup, got it.

15:09.735 --> 15:11.102
Quicker.
Quickly, please.

15:11.103 --> 15:12.737
Oh, God!
Much quicker than this!

15:12.738 --> 15:14.471
My keys!
I can't get 'em off my...

15:14.507 --> 15:16.474
I-I don't understand.
I put the doll right there.

15:16.475 --> 15:17.909
Well, where did it go?

15:17.910 --> 15:19.911
Maybe it finally
became a real girl!

15:19.912 --> 15:21.745
(Zander humming)

15:21.781 --> 15:23.147
(gasps) Zander!

15:23.182 --> 15:24.149
What's shakin'?

15:24.150 --> 15:25.417
Those cargo shorts

15:25.418 --> 15:26.950
are looking awfully full, buddy.

15:26.986 --> 15:28.419
Uh... thank you.

15:28.454 --> 15:29.821
We know you took
the doll, Zander.

15:29.822 --> 15:31.055
Empty your pockets.

15:31.090 --> 15:32.624
Um, I would love to,

15:32.625 --> 15:34.325
but, uh, it's so cold in here,

15:34.326 --> 15:35.559
I should get a sweater
from the car!

15:35.594 --> 15:37.461
Klepto's on the move!

15:37.496 --> 15:38.697
I'm not a klepto!

15:38.698 --> 15:40.864
(panting)

15:45.604 --> 15:47.172
Oh, hey, guys.

15:47.173 --> 15:49.107
Um, nothing at all in
my pockets, by the way.

15:49.108 --> 15:50.141
You were asking
about that before.

15:50.142 --> 15:51.141
There's the doll!

15:51.143 --> 15:52.043
In the storm drain!

15:52.044 --> 15:54.012
What? I don't think so.

15:54.013 --> 15:55.480
Hey, do you ever
just want to stomp?

15:55.481 --> 15:56.914
Your street...
is so... LOUISE: No!

15:56.949 --> 15:58.983
Good... for stomping!
No! Stop it! No! No!

15:58.984 --> 16:00.018
LOUISE and TINA: No! Stomp!

16:00.019 --> 16:01.073
Eh, it's all right.

16:02.501 --> 16:04.202
Steve? Uh, I'm sorry.

16:04.203 --> 16:06.403
I didn't know you were...
crème... intolerant.

16:06.439 --> 16:08.305
STEVE: No need to talk to me
while I'm in here, please.

16:08.341 --> 16:10.975
Right. Well... just, you know,
take your time and...

16:11.010 --> 16:14.078
You're still doing it right now.
I know. I'm sorry. It's, uh, like...

16:14.113 --> 16:15.512
So you're still there, right?
You're still out there?

16:15.548 --> 16:17.481
Yes. I don't know why. I-I am.

16:17.516 --> 16:20.652
Perfect! Now the doll's gone
and we're all getting grounded.

16:20.653 --> 16:22.620
Wait, are we getting
grounded, too?

16:22.621 --> 16:24.222
I thought Mom
was talking to you.

16:24.223 --> 16:26.224
Yeah, she was making a lot
of eye contact with you

16:26.225 --> 16:27.691
and saying your name a lot.

16:27.727 --> 16:29.527
Oh, fine, so it's all my fault

16:29.528 --> 16:31.863
just because it was my idea
to take the doll

16:31.864 --> 16:34.466
and break up Frond and Gayle
and sing a Spanish ballad

16:34.467 --> 16:35.933
about the dangers of love.
Sure!

16:35.968 --> 16:37.836
Blame me! Okay. Okay.

16:37.837 --> 16:39.671
It's your fault.
You need to work on yourself.

16:39.672 --> 16:41.172
Don't you dare.

16:41.173 --> 16:42.674
You're squeezing my cheeks.

16:42.675 --> 16:44.175
Wait a sec.
What's wrong with me?

16:44.176 --> 16:46.177
This is great!
The doll's gone,

16:46.178 --> 16:47.746
Frond can't give it to Gayle.

16:47.747 --> 16:50.081
Zander will confess
that he got rid of the doll,

16:50.082 --> 16:52.350
and Louise a-no-get-a grounded.

16:52.351 --> 16:54.052
And why would I confess?

16:54.053 --> 16:57.022
Because in return,
you will get...

16:57.023 --> 16:58.489
a kiss with Tina.

16:58.524 --> 16:59.890
Oh, my.
What?

16:59.925 --> 17:01.026
Interesting.

17:01.027 --> 17:02.027
Uh-huh.

17:02.028 --> 17:03.428
Yeah, let's do it.

17:03.429 --> 17:05.262
I will just prepare my mouth.

17:05.263 --> 17:06.531
Uh-uh-uh.

17:06.531 --> 17:08.132
Confess first, then kiss.

17:08.166 --> 17:09.299
Half now, half later.

17:09.335 --> 17:10.401
All later, none now.

17:10.435 --> 17:11.903
Okay, fine, but no tongue!

17:11.904 --> 17:13.537
I'm only ten and I'm not ready!

17:13.571 --> 17:14.972
Deal!
Louise.

17:15.007 --> 17:17.776
What? Why are you looking
at me like that?

17:17.777 --> 17:19.210
'Cause you got to kiss a klepto?

17:19.211 --> 17:20.544
I'm not a klepto.
Then what?

17:21.513 --> 17:22.512
Cut it out.

17:23.049 --> 17:24.516
What?

17:24.517 --> 17:26.284
You think I should want
Aunt Gayle to be happy

17:26.285 --> 17:28.852
because she's our aunt
and we love her?

17:28.888 --> 17:30.588
You're saying
I'm being selfish?!

17:30.589 --> 17:32.057
A selfish brat?!

17:32.058 --> 17:33.357
Is that what you're saying?!

17:34.226 --> 17:35.460
Oh, gosh darn it!

17:35.461 --> 17:37.462
Son of a bitch!
Damn you, Tina!

17:37.463 --> 17:38.730
You're right, okay?

17:38.731 --> 17:40.198
You don't have to yell at me!

17:40.199 --> 17:42.066
What's happening?

17:42.101 --> 17:43.400
Tina, take it easy.

17:43.436 --> 17:44.702
But how are we gonna get

17:44.703 --> 17:46.271
the dang doll out of the sewer?

17:46.272 --> 17:47.805
(gasps) I know how.

17:51.577 --> 17:53.544
Just a quick walk-by.
That's not weird.

17:53.579 --> 17:55.879
A walk-by and a ding-dong ditch.
Huh?

17:55.915 --> 17:57.215
(doorbells jingle)
What's going on?

17:57.216 --> 17:58.750
Oh. Hey, Teddy.

17:58.751 --> 18:00.485
Uh, Steve needed
to use the bathroom.

18:00.486 --> 18:02.420
It's a long story.
Oh, me?

18:02.421 --> 18:04.556
I'm just coming back from
an amazing night with Charlie.

18:04.557 --> 18:06.991
We, uh, whoa...
we did it all, you know?

18:06.992 --> 18:08.926
We... (laughs) Talk about wow!

18:08.961 --> 18:11.295
Anyhoosie doosie,
how's your night going?

18:11.330 --> 18:13.398
Not great.
Not great?

18:13.399 --> 18:14.899
But you made rib roast.

18:14.900 --> 18:16.935
It kind of sort of
gave Steve diarrhea.

18:16.936 --> 18:18.937
Like, right away.
Oh.

18:18.938 --> 18:21.371
Also, I just don't think...
he's that into me.

18:21.407 --> 18:22.473
Not into you?

18:22.508 --> 18:23.942
Not into you?
He's in there?!

18:23.943 --> 18:25.944
Teddy...
Hey! Listen up! Steve!

18:25.945 --> 18:27.811
STEVE: Okay, now we got
another person talking to me?

18:27.847 --> 18:29.114
Uh, Teddy, it's okay, please...

18:29.115 --> 18:30.648
No, no, no, no, Bob.
Let me talk.

18:30.649 --> 18:32.083
This guy out here

18:32.084 --> 18:33.785
invites you to dinner
in his house,

18:33.786 --> 18:35.753
he slaves over
that beautiful rib roast,

18:35.754 --> 18:37.589
and you're not into him?

18:37.590 --> 18:39.256
Who do you think you are,
Indiana Jones or something?

18:39.291 --> 18:40.458
STEVE: I'm not Indiana Jones.

18:40.459 --> 18:41.960
He doesn't like that comparison.

18:41.961 --> 18:43.828
What are you,
too busy fighting Nazis?

18:43.829 --> 18:45.697
Well, guess what?
STEVE: I don't fight Nazis.

18:45.698 --> 18:46.965
Then you don't deserve him.

18:46.966 --> 18:48.633
He's an amazing guy,

18:48.634 --> 18:50.001
and he makes really good
burgers, and he's my friend!

18:50.002 --> 18:51.436
Teddy... thanks.

18:51.437 --> 18:52.837
Whew.
Got a little worked up there.

18:52.838 --> 18:54.472
(laughs)

18:54.473 --> 18:56.307
My therapist says I take
these things too seriously.

18:56.308 --> 18:58.176
Made a lot of calls
to her tonight!

18:58.177 --> 18:59.510
Oh...

18:59.545 --> 19:00.944
All right, where is everybody?

19:00.980 --> 19:03.281
(gasps) Louise's head
is in the sewer!

19:03.282 --> 19:05.482
Louise, what are you doing?
Get your head out of there!

19:05.518 --> 19:08.018
Mom, Dad, no! She's in
the gutter for a reason.

19:08.053 --> 19:10.221
Is that my spatula?
Is that my necklace?

19:10.222 --> 19:11.822
Weird, very weird.

19:11.857 --> 19:12.690
Got it!

19:12.691 --> 19:13.691
Whoa!
Whoa!

19:13.692 --> 19:15.259
Is that me?

19:15.294 --> 19:17.128
Yes. Mr. Frond made it for you

19:17.129 --> 19:18.997
out of his dead grandma's shawl,
and I took it.

19:18.998 --> 19:21.165
I was trying
to keep you two apart,

19:21.200 --> 19:23.034
and... I guess that was wrong.

19:23.035 --> 19:25.702
But then look who turned it
all around and saved the day.

19:25.738 --> 19:26.804
I did.

19:26.805 --> 19:28.338
Louise Belcher. Hero.

19:28.374 --> 19:30.575
He... he made it?
For me?

19:30.576 --> 19:32.577
It's one of the signs! Oh!

19:32.578 --> 19:35.146
Don't touch it, don't touch it.
Oh, she's touching it.

19:35.147 --> 19:36.880
I love it, I love it,
I love it. Oh, I love it!

19:36.916 --> 19:38.349
Steve, do you maybe
have something

19:38.350 --> 19:39.884
you want to say to Bob?

19:39.885 --> 19:41.853
I-I guess I've been
a little standoffish tonight,

19:41.854 --> 19:44.489
and for that,
I'd like to say that I'm sorry.

19:44.490 --> 19:46.891
And then, Bob, do you want
to say anything to Steve?

19:46.892 --> 19:48.893
Yeah. I mean, I may
have been a little...

19:48.894 --> 19:51.062
overeager about
this dinner party.

19:51.063 --> 19:52.897
Will you two just hug already?!

19:52.898 --> 19:54.698
Okay, fine,
I'll get in on it, too.

19:54.733 --> 19:56.067
(Teddy grunting, Bob groaning)

19:56.068 --> 19:57.869
Uh, Teddy, let go.

19:57.870 --> 19:59.570
Uh, Zander,
you ready to hit the road?

19:59.605 --> 20:00.772
Wait for me, Tina.

20:00.773 --> 20:01.940
Probably not.

20:01.941 --> 20:03.241
I'm keeping your retainer!

20:03.242 --> 20:05.009
Oh, I kind of need that back.

20:05.010 --> 20:07.078
No, you don't.
You're perfect the way you are!

20:07.079 --> 20:08.912
No, I really do need...
Oh, he's gone.

20:08.948 --> 20:10.915
Teddy, you want to
come up for dinner?

20:10.916 --> 20:13.718
Uh, you know, it's getting late.
I'm gonna take a rain check.

20:13.719 --> 20:15.853
GAYLE: Phillip,
please open the door.

20:15.854 --> 20:17.654
I know. It's over.

20:17.690 --> 20:19.190
You don't throw up
in the bathroom,

20:19.191 --> 20:20.691
wipe your mouth on a maxi pad

20:20.726 --> 20:21.893
and get a third date.

20:21.894 --> 20:23.594
(passionate grunting)

20:23.629 --> 20:24.729
Aw...

20:24.730 --> 20:26.197
All right, well,

20:26.198 --> 20:28.066
let's just go eat
the cold rib roast.

20:28.067 --> 20:29.801
Cold rib roast!

20:29.802 --> 20:31.369
Hey, Louise. You did
the right thing.

20:31.370 --> 20:33.137
I know.
I'm proud of you.

20:33.138 --> 20:35.406
Yeah, yeah, I got it.
You know, love is a funny thing.

20:35.407 --> 20:37.575
You just got to...
Aah, Tina! Can we not watch

20:37.576 --> 20:39.461
Aunt Gayle
and Mr. Frond make out?!

20:39.462 --> 20:42.174
