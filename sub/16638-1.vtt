00:11.271 --> 00:13.088
this is a utf-8 subtitle

00:13.327 --> 00:15.816
Your feddddddddel more and more calm...

00:16.544 --> 00:17.952
Now imagine a screen...

00:18.687 --> 00:21.583
A movie screen that opens before you

00:22.616 --> 00:24.927
Create on it any place you like

00:26.262 --> 00:27.734
Concentrate on your breathing

00:28.143 --> 00:31.190
Helping your body to relax...feel at peace

00:31.702 --> 00:36.294
You don't have to change it.
Just let it come and go

00:36.494 --> 00:39.789
Come and go...

00:42.789 --> 00:44.333
Now...

00:44.548 --> 00:45.811
You are there

00:46.997 --> 00:48.509
Pay attention to the details

00:51.179 --> 00:52.196
The colors

00:53.772 --> 00:55.092
The textures

00:57.035 --> 00:58.163
The light

01:00.164 --> 01:02.923
The temperature. Feel the temperature

01:06.306 --> 01:09.418
Allow this calm view to develop before you

01:12.642 --> 01:15.866
The feeling of peace is infinite...

01:20.594 --> 01:22.290
It's raining cats and dogs

01:23.104 --> 01:24.984
Are you sure this is closed

01:27.016 --> 01:28.465
Are you more calm now?

01:28.656 --> 01:31.312
Well, is not easy.
With that view I have in front

01:31.544 --> 01:32.520
What view?

01:32.929 --> 01:35.039
I can see through your skirt

01:36.472 --> 01:39.743
You are such a pig!
You know what, I won't read you anymore.

01:40.167 --> 01:42.902
Besides, is almost time.
I'm going to pick her up

01:43.048 --> 01:44.975
Ok, I�ll stand up and prepare some coffee

01:45.790 --> 01:47.655
Would you like some music?

01:47.871 --> 01:49.190
Ok, whatever is on

01:51.423 --> 01:53.822
Ok, I�ll leave you with your Wagner

01:55.165 --> 01:55.892
See you in a while

02:31.409 --> 02:35.313
OUT TO SEA

02:40.608 --> 02:43.777
Julia, get in the car.
You're going to freeze

02:56.527 --> 03:00.495
You are Gen�, right. I am Mark, hello

03:00.782 --> 03:01.991
And Julia?

03:07.974 --> 03:09.574
It looks like Galicia doesn't like us

03:09.982 --> 03:11.854
Yeah, well, it's February.

03:13.046 --> 03:14.302
How was your flight?

03:14.727 --> 03:16.126
Fine. We finally meet

03:16.501 --> 03:19.598
Would you mind coming with me in the car?

03:23.806 --> 03:25.737
We had agreed that only one
person would come

03:25.886 --> 03:26.757
Yes, of course

03:27.149 --> 03:29.486
- And..?
- Oh, Mark? He's only here to take notes

03:29.581 --> 03:33.612
- Ok. Do you trust him?
- Yes. Well...he works at the firm

03:33.787 --> 03:37.573
Look, I�m not sure if you are aware of the step
that Ramon has to take

03:37.717 --> 03:39.899
Of course I know the step Ramon has to take.
We've talked about it

03:40.299 --> 03:43.676
Today it's you, then its the press, then it's the television.

03:43.899 --> 03:46.956
Ramon is afraid that this could be taken
in the wrong direction

03:47.307 --> 03:51.595
All I can tell you is that I�ve
come to do things as best as possible

03:51.828 --> 03:52.931
I hope so...

03:54.099 --> 03:56.235
And I remind you that for me this is really important

03:56.627 --> 03:58.722
Not only professionally...

04:04.154 --> 04:07.177
Believe me
I understand Ramon very well

04:26.239 --> 04:27.799
- Hello
- Hello

04:28.815 --> 04:29.759
My name is Julia

04:30.352 --> 04:31.296
You are the lawyer

04:32.343 --> 04:33.903
This is Manuela. Ramon's sister in law

04:36.639 --> 04:38.454
- Do you want help?
- No, no. It's fine

04:41.358 --> 04:42.647
They're here

04:52.012 --> 04:53.260
- Hello
- Hello

04:54.541 --> 04:55.829
Excuse me for not giving you my hand

04:57.644 --> 04:58.860
How come?

05:01.531 --> 05:02.876
They tell me you are a little nervous

05:06.940 --> 05:11.099
- Well, let's see. The first thing is breakfast
- What time?

05:11.499 --> 05:16.196
9:30. Don't think that I like to wake up early

05:19.602 --> 05:23.113
- After that, I listen to the radio for bit
- What do you like to listen to?

05:24.227 --> 05:28.442
- A little of everything. Mostly debates.
- You like debates?

05:30.027 --> 05:31.640
Yes, yes. I like the party

05:37.545 --> 05:41.119
See. This is my personal computer

05:43.520 --> 05:47.416
- Did you design it?
- Yes, I like inventions.

05:47.952 --> 05:50.831
My father or my nephew builds them

05:54.118 --> 05:56.430
You are so serious all of a sudden

06:02.809 --> 06:04.513
Why dying?

06:08.976 --> 06:17.576
Well, let's see. I want to die because
for me, life in this way...is not worthy

06:20.280 --> 06:27.551
I can understand if other tetraplegic could
feel offended when I say life like this is not worthy

06:28.486 --> 06:31.854
But I don't judge anyone.

06:32.463 --> 06:36.614
Who am I to judge those that want to live?

06:37.391 --> 06:41.789
That's why I ask not to be judged nor the
person that helps me to die

06:41.958 --> 06:43.558
And do you think someone is going to help you?

06:45.684 --> 06:51.900
Well, that would depend on the ones taking the decision.
If they manage to conquer their fears

06:53.468 --> 06:57.540
Is not such a big deal. Death has always been there
and always will be

06:58.099 --> 07:04.228
In the end we all get there. All of us.
It is a part of us

07:04.379 --> 07:08.322
Why are they so surprised
because I say I want to die?

07:09.026 --> 07:11.874
As if it is contagious

07:14.386 --> 07:19.009
If we finally go to trial, they will ask you
why you don't seek alternatives to your disability

07:19.913 --> 07:23.042
Why do you reject the wheel chair?

07:23.346 --> 07:29.881
To accept the wheelchair would be like
accepting breadcrumbs of what used to be my freedom

07:30.128 --> 07:34.368
Look, you are sitting there, less than 2 meters away

07:34.929 --> 07:36.912
What are 2 meters?

07:37.775 --> 07:40.575
An insignificant trip for any human being

07:40.840 --> 07:53.781
Well, for me, those 2 meters, necessary to get to you
and being able to touch you, is an impossible journey...

07:53.982 --> 07:57.333
...a chimera, a dream

07:59.853 --> 08:01.805
That's why I want to die

08:03.492 --> 08:05.996
The three hours have passed, Ramon

08:06.324 --> 08:08.021
She has to change my posture

08:08.492 --> 08:10.243
Would you mind waiting downstairs?

08:11.324 --> 08:17.099
He called us a year ago.
He wanted us to, literally, help him die

08:19.188 --> 08:26.546
I told him that we could provide psychological help,
legal support. But we wouldn't put the cyanide in his mouth

08:27.643 --> 08:31.850
He got very mad. He called us liars.
I had to hang the phone

08:32.585 --> 08:36.905
A few days later he called again, more calm.
I was surprised at how decided he was

08:37.097 --> 08:38.994
- He has ever hesitated?
- Never

08:39.721 --> 08:41.089
That is very important

08:43.952 --> 08:46.041
- And how long has he been like this?
- 26 years

08:46.474 --> 08:49.865
His mother used to take care of him but
when she died, his sister in law took over

08:50.904 --> 08:51.992
How do you feel?

08:52.360 --> 08:55.681
Fine, this arm...a little higher

08:57.880 --> 08:59.103
I'm going to change the catheter

08:59.446 --> 09:03.759
- Not now Manuela
- Is just a moment. Let them wait

09:03.943 --> 09:06.622
She is married to Jose, Ramon's brother

09:07.175 --> 09:10.662
They live of the farm and a little orchard they have

09:11.342 --> 09:13.902
And what do they think about this?

09:18.477 --> 09:19.452
Ideas are free.

09:20.804 --> 09:23.291
But I think that is not right

09:25.556 --> 09:26.444
But why not?

09:27.491 --> 09:30.915
I want what's best for him.
Everyone in this house wants that

09:33.755 --> 09:35.355
Then why would he want to die?

09:35.674 --> 09:37.529
I cannot get that into my head

09:37.705 --> 09:39.034
Is not rational, as he says

09:41.669 --> 09:48.023
I cannot give it to him and I don't give my
authorization to do it in this house

09:56.931 --> 09:58.940
Hello

10:01.946 --> 10:04.707
- Don't leave that there Javi!
- Oh come on mom!

10:05.057 --> 10:06.394
Take it to your room

10:08.986 --> 10:10.706
Your uncle wants you to check the machine

10:13.193 --> 10:14.657
- The bag...
- Yes!

10:20.201 --> 10:24.001
- What's wrong?
- The roller is a little stuck

10:29.832 --> 10:32.655
- Didn't you have exam today?
- No. And the lawyer

10:35.782 --> 10:38.853
She is with Gen� and grandpa.
He took them to the beach

10:39.167 --> 10:42.918
They might end up in Corunna.
With that head of him

10:43.765 --> 10:45.838
Don't talk like that about your grandfather

10:46.030 --> 10:47.566
His mind is completely gone

10:47.990 --> 10:50.357
Of course, he is old, what do you want?

10:50.533 --> 10:52.565
Well, that he stays out of the way

10:53.001 --> 10:54.297
He is all day at home...

10:55.384 --> 10:56.514
As if we needed him.

11:04.050 --> 11:05.096
What

11:11.591 --> 11:15.111
Look, one day...I don't know when,
maybe in a long time...

11:15.367 --> 11:21.767
One day you are going to regret so much, so much what you just said.
That you will want the ground to swallow you

11:23.099 --> 11:28.178
- But why?
- One day, you'll see. One day...

11:30.139 --> 11:37.361
Here the ocean is very treacherous.
Those who dare bathe in it, have to be very careful

11:38.826 --> 11:40.594
My son jumped from here.

11:41.282 --> 11:42.897
I don't know what he was thinking.

11:45.120 --> 11:55.153
He jumped exactly when the water was receding
and he hit his neck against the sand

11:56.954 --> 12:03.082
This is very very sad.

12:06.145 --> 12:10.777
God wants him to keep on living.

12:11.656 --> 12:13.863
But you know that he doesn't want to live anymore

12:16.399 --> 12:20.319
But, he never told me anything,
he never told me...he never told me anything

13:13.015 --> 13:19.973
Look, we will win Heaven, because
we have spent our whole lives in Hell

13:23.116 --> 13:32.387
I tape this image so the judges or politicians
or whoever has to decide

13:33.764 --> 13:35.045
understand better...

13:36.012 --> 13:43.723
Apparently they can't identify with the psychological pain of the person,
then maybe this way they'll understand that this is not life

13:44.084 --> 13:46.274
Why do you smile so much Ramon?

13:47.025 --> 13:50.714
When you can't escape and depend
constantly on others

13:52.298 --> 13:56.201
You learn to cry by laughing

14:31.924 --> 14:34.054
Good morning

14:34.366 --> 14:37.070
- Does Ramon Sampedro lives here?
- Yes, what do you want?

14:39.005 --> 14:42.188
I was taking a ride and thought
about visiting him

14:43.813 --> 14:45.765
I heard lots of people come to see him

14:49.980 --> 14:50.748
Ok

14:54.643 --> 14:55.682
Just a little while

15:05.330 --> 15:06.346
My name is Rosa

15:07.218 --> 15:08.177
Come closer

15:18.545 --> 15:19.344
Where are you from?

15:19.666 --> 15:22.137
Boiro. I came on my bike

15:27.480 --> 15:30.392
Oh God, I feel like such a fool

15:32.056 --> 15:35.837
- Why?
- Well, because I don't know what to say. Since I don't know you

15:36.864 --> 15:43.054
Don't worry about that. I can't do anything else.
Please, have a seat.

15:48.206 --> 15:49.310
Why did you came?

15:54.268 --> 15:58.765
You're not making it easy.
What do you do?

15:59.411 --> 16:00.788
I work in a conserve factory

16:01.260 --> 16:04.299
and I�m also a radio host at Radio Boiro,
Wednesdays and Fridays

16:04.459 --> 16:08.179
- So, maybe I�ve heard you sometime
- Yes?

16:08.834 --> 16:15.283
- But is only an amateur thing... - No,
you are pretty good - Yes, apparently, eh?

16:16.569 --> 16:20.305
The thing is to get started, after
that no one can stop me

16:20.521 --> 16:22.825
- I have 2 little sons
- Your husband?

16:16.562 --> 16:32.672
Let's see. I had a boyfriend, the
father of my youngest son...

16:33.017 --> 16:37.744
but he also left me...we left him.
So now I�m alone but happy

16:38.491 --> 16:42.498
I was asking in case I had any chance...

16:48.841 --> 16:50.193
Why do you laugh?

16:52.008 --> 16:53.290
Sorry...

16:54.176 --> 16:55.656
It's ok, I was joking

16:57.185 --> 17:01.312
Besides, I don't think I�d be willing to take on
two children, I have enough with my nephew

17:03.960 --> 17:05.736
I saw you on TV the other day

17:06.487 --> 17:08.544
hmmm...see, now we are getting closer

17:10.583 --> 17:11.655
Closer to what?

17:11.886 --> 17:13.623
To the reason why you came

17:15.422 --> 17:20.622
I heard what you said and then I saw your
eyes, that are really pretty

17:20.941 --> 17:21.367
Thanks

17:22.108 --> 17:26.758
And I thought, those eyes full of life!
Why would someone with those eyes want to die

17:28.076 --> 17:32.086
Look, we all have problems sometimes and
we don't have to run away of them, you know?

17:32.492 --> 17:38.460
- No, I don't run away of my problems...
- Yes, of course you do. That's why I wanted to come

17:38.764 --> 17:40.180
What for?

17:43.203 --> 17:44.427
To give you reasons to live

17:46.163 --> 17:50.571
- To tell you that life...
- Life what?

17:55.498 --> 17:56.730
Is worth it

17:59.826 --> 18:04.809
Let's see, did you came here to
see me or to convince me?

18:04.993 --> 18:07.112
No, I came because I want to
be your friend Ramon

18:07.657 --> 18:10.465
If you want to be my friend, Rosa,
you should start by respecting my will

18:13.816 --> 18:14.903
How can you be so closed?

18:15.112 --> 18:18.824
Don't judge me. Don't judge me Rosa.
Not in my own house

18:19.832 --> 18:21.312
Or do you want me to judge you?

18:22.328 --> 18:27.079
Do you want me to judge you?
Why don't we talk about the real reason you came

18:28.070 --> 18:32.006
Why don't we talk about the fact that you are
clearly a frustrated woman...

18:32.527 --> 18:35.862
that woke up this Saturday looking for
ways of giving reason to your own life

18:39.847 --> 18:42.094
Yes, run. You that can.

18:49.543 --> 18:52.494
Thanks a lot.
So you don't want me to put you anything?

18:52.741 --> 18:55.910
- No, dear. Just stay as cheerful. Good night
- Good night

18:57.102 --> 19:00.991
Well, it's 8:45 and here we are at Radio Boiro.

19:01.246 --> 19:04.910
I remind you that you can call
and request your favorite song

19:05.877 --> 19:14.020
Before I continue...I would like to dedicate the
next song to someone that maybe is listening tonight

19:14.892 --> 19:17.019
I know he listens to the radio a lot

19:19.627 --> 19:22.731
I would love it for him to call me someday
and ask for a song

19:23.436 --> 19:28.391
Although I know he won't because...the last time
we saw each other we didn't end up in good terms

19:28.619 --> 19:31.962
But for what it's worth,
I�d like to tell him I'm sorry

19:32.826 --> 19:37.018
I'm sorry I judged you Ramon, I am
such a fool and I can't help it

19:37.873 --> 19:44.610
Enough...for you my friend, Ramon,
"Negra Sombra" (Black Shadow)

20:15.015 --> 20:16.996
- Yes?
- Hello

20:17.187 --> 20:18.836
Gen�! How are you?

20:19.036 --> 20:23.244
Well, still at the office.
You are giving us too much work, Ramon

20:23.979 --> 20:24.947
I'm just kidding

20:26.049 --> 20:29.723
Hey, the report was spectacular.
We have received a lot of support calls

20:30.026 --> 20:33.178
- This will be really great for the trial
- If you say so...

20:33.618 --> 20:38.516
Oh, come on! You have to improve that mood,
otherwise we won't be able to do anything

20:38.717 --> 20:41.307
- You knew we had to do this.
- Yes, I know, I know

20:41.804 --> 20:47.699
Julia, the lawyer, wants to see you again
and this time for longer

20:48.619 --> 20:50.211
Has she fallen in love with me?

20:50.474 --> 20:53.291
You wish handsome!
besides, she is married

20:53.507 --> 20:56.481
No, she says she needs to know you
better to prepare the case

20:56.714 --> 20:58.803
That's what they all say

20:59.114 --> 21:03.513
Wait...
2 minutes and I�m there

21:03.785 --> 21:09.393
Hey, did you know that the guy that came
with her wants to go out with me

21:11.689 --> 21:14.816
- Are you leaving me for a lawyer?
- No

21:15.457 --> 21:16.920
You are missing on it

22:29.097 --> 22:30.416
I see it quite well

22:31.112 --> 22:31.865
Your leg

22:33.671 --> 22:34.776
Well, yes..it moves

22:35.744 --> 22:41.072
Let's see...this is going to be easy.
You only need to answer with your heart

22:41.599 --> 22:42.768
With the head, you mean..

22:44.303 --> 22:46.167
With the head.
You don't mind if I record it, right?

22:51.871 --> 22:53.758
Let's begin with your youth, before your accident.

22:55.326 --> 22:56.429
What did you do then?

22:56.750 --> 23:00.165
Is that necessary?
I had forgot all about it.

23:01.878 --> 23:03.158
Is your memory that bad?

23:03.757 --> 23:08.260
No. I just thought we would talk about
my suicide demand

23:10.821 --> 23:14.165
We will Ramon. Is just that is very important
that the judge identifies with you

23:14.883 --> 23:16.179
and that he understands you.

23:16.732 --> 23:19.699
For that I need to know who is
Ramon Sampedro and who he was

23:22.387 --> 23:24.651
That way, you will use it against me later.

23:25.850 --> 23:27.570
You are such a Galician!

23:29.387 --> 23:31.786
- I'm your lawyer, I�m on your side
- Ok

23:36.097 --> 23:41.857
When I was 19, I packed my things and
I went around the world

23:42.897 --> 23:45.746
I was doing that for a couple of years,
until the accident

23:46.617 --> 23:49.945
Wait, wait. You went around the world with
only 20 years?

23:50.625 --> 23:52.800
You just don't know how.
Ship mechanic.

23:53.832 --> 23:57.552
I always tell my nephew.
To travel without money, become a sailor.

24:01.008 --> 24:01.743
What?

24:02.135 --> 24:03.351
Looking for proof?

24:04.463 --> 24:06.978
No, is that I can't see a single picture
of you around here

24:08.151 --> 24:09.487
How were you in your younger years?

24:10.127 --> 24:13.101
Why? Am I so ugly now, or what?

24:16.910 --> 24:18.636
Ok, I won't ask you anything else. That's it

24:25.069 --> 24:26.485
You don't like looking into the past, right?

24:26.718 --> 24:28.877
Of course not, I look into the future.

24:29.068 --> 24:34.315
- And what is the future for you?
- Death, just like for you

24:35.780 --> 24:40.804
Don't you think about death?
I'm not the only one who thinks about it.

24:41.076 --> 24:43.098
Yes, yes. Of course I think about it

24:45.318 --> 24:47.613
I just try that it doesn't become
my only thought

24:58.557 --> 25:00.132
Tomorrow is going to rain

25:17.850 --> 25:19.243
Tomorrow is going to rain

25:23.194 --> 25:24.505
I think he whistled

25:25.832 --> 25:28.208
- I didn't hear a thing
- Yes, he did

25:38.424 --> 25:41.457
- What do you want?
- The game already started

25:42.431 --> 25:44.480
But you know I don't like soccer

25:46.064 --> 25:47.431
Why don't you watch it downstairs

25:49.680 --> 25:54.806
Hey, if you want to convince me
you need to give me a rational justification

26:05.166 --> 26:06.254
The "Depor" is playing

26:08.637 --> 26:10.644
That is not a rational justification

26:11.541 --> 26:13.621
- But it is important
- Why?

26:13.909 --> 26:17.773
Because it is decisive for the league.
If they loose this one, they can only make it to second place

26:20.149 --> 26:21.508
OK, turn it on

26:26.348 --> 26:28.301
- Can you see?
- Yes

26:37.724 --> 26:39.272
Did you hear him whistle too?

26:43.032 --> 26:45.175
Ramon told me you asked about the pictures

26:46.247 --> 26:46.928
Yes

26:48.031 --> 26:49.723
There's gotta be one somewhere

26:50.463 --> 26:51.431
I'll look for them tomorrow

26:51.525 --> 26:52.844
Thanks

26:54.508 --> 26:56.565
If you need more blankets, look in the closet

26:58.487 --> 27:00.367
In June, it is still cold at night

27:01.016 --> 27:01.759
Manuela...

27:06.150 --> 27:07.664
- No, no, no
- Yes, yes, yes

27:08.247 --> 27:09.774
I cannot accept this, I can't

27:10.006 --> 27:13.277
Manuela, I�m going to stay a couple of days.
The least I can do is contribute with something

27:13.519 --> 27:15.538
But added to the fact that you are
doing it for free

27:17.609 --> 27:20.856
I'm doing this because I want to.
Manuela, please...

27:22.528 --> 27:26.480
Ok. Anything that you need, please let me know

27:28.033 --> 27:28.726
Thanks

27:29.768 --> 27:31.343
What are you plotting over there?

27:32.063 --> 27:32.831
Nothing

27:36.983 --> 27:39.007
It's a shame you can't see the sea from here

27:39.734 --> 27:40.870
Is better like that

27:42.783 --> 27:45.062
That way I can see it when I want to

27:46.622 --> 27:48.013
How come?

27:51.038 --> 27:57.220
When I want to, I concentrate and
take a step to the sea

27:58.621 --> 27:59.684
Flying

28:00.309 --> 28:02.228
I imagine that the sea means a lot to you

28:04.236 --> 28:06.098
Well, the sea gave me life and
then took it away

28:07.107 --> 28:08.699
I don't know if that means anything

28:11.908 --> 28:14.419
Give me some details about that day.
The day that your life changed, ok?

28:15.507 --> 28:16.315
Whatever you say.

28:17.284 --> 28:18.828
Ok, first...

28:20.844 --> 28:22.171
...when did it happen?

28:23.125 --> 28:24.949
August 23rd of '68

28:26.755 --> 28:33.691
- You still lived with your parents?
- Yes. I was still a kid

28:34.699 --> 28:42.603
- Were you alone at the beach that day?
- No, I was with some friends, town's folk

28:45.754 --> 28:50.185
But how is it that someone so familiar with the sea
didn't calculate the receding

28:52.705 --> 28:54.657
I was distracted

28:56.130 --> 28:57.793
Distracted?

28:58.808 --> 29:02.400
Yes, I was thinking about things

29:05.615 --> 29:06.616
And?

29:26.598 --> 29:28.789
Ok. Leave it alone. It doesn't matter

29:29.684 --> 29:31.621
I can see you don't want to
talk about it either

29:32.060 --> 29:33.612
No. I'm just remembering

29:54.255 --> 29:59.202
When I realized I was in the air,
jumping on an almost empty pool

30:08.369 --> 30:13.434
- Were you left unconscious?
- No. I was just there...face down

30:14.153 --> 30:15.345
Floating

30:19.456 --> 30:21.968
You know is true what they say about those
that are about to die

30:22.176 --> 30:26.088
that all of a sudden you get to see the
most important moments of your life

30:26.848 --> 30:27.951
That happened to me

30:30.815 --> 30:32.111
And what did you see?

31:32.400 --> 31:37.624
They say that those that drown, after all the
air has been expelled, die instantly

31:38.401 --> 31:42.097
A sweet death.
I should have died then

31:57.007 --> 32:00.839
- Do you still see all this people?
- Some I do, some I don't

32:04.062 --> 32:08.198
- Who is this girl?
- Some girl

32:11.412 --> 32:13.862
Well, she appears in many pictures

32:18.218 --> 32:20.841
She lived in the town.
Can I have a puff?

32:22.128 --> 32:25.631
- Do you smoke?
- From time to time in case it kills me

32:26.223 --> 32:27.456
but nothing...

32:35.408 --> 32:40.032
- She was my girlfriend
- Your girlfriend? And what happened to her?

32:43.849 --> 32:51.123
There was a time when she used to go to the hospital.
One day she said something foolish about getting married

32:51.603 --> 32:59.529
And I told her to get out of there, try to resume her
life the best way she could and that she should forget about me

33:02.298 --> 33:03.728
But, did you love her?

33:05.489 --> 33:06.753
That was not the issue

33:10.153 --> 33:11.273
How come?

33:12.720 --> 33:16.887
The issue was if I wanted to love her in this condition

33:18.856 --> 33:20.704
Are you telling me you refuse to love because...

33:22.464 --> 33:23.976
Because I can't love

33:24.695 --> 33:25.934
Just like that

33:29.741 --> 33:34.838
So, what I have to tell the judge is that, in your opinion,
tetraplegics have no right to fall in love

33:35.062 --> 33:41.550
But who's talking about tetraplegics?
I'm talking about me, Ramon Sampedro

33:52.445 --> 33:54.317
There are other ways of making love

33:54.540 --> 33:55.764
Yes of course

34:02.115 --> 34:04.788
Has any girl kissed you in the past 27 years?

34:09.579 --> 34:12.121
Now you are going to show me how, no?

34:17.770 --> 34:19.938
- The girl from Borio is here
- The girl from Borio?

34:20.974 --> 34:23.745
- Christian, I told you to come here
- Rosa!

34:24.761 --> 34:26.784
- Hi Ramon
- I told you to come here!

34:27.679 --> 34:30.712
Leave him, it's ok.
Are you good or bad?

34:33.137 --> 34:36.041
- Bad.
- Then we will get along fine

34:36.768 --> 34:38.561
- I'm Julia
- I'm Rosa, nice to meet you

34:39.143 --> 34:40.487
I'm sorry to have interrupted you

34:42.264 --> 34:43.664
I'll go for a while and leave you alone

34:49.567 --> 34:51.998
- How are you?
- Fine

34:52.438 --> 34:56.091
I hope you are not here to give me some of
those reasons to live you always bring

34:56.552 --> 34:59.501
No. No way.
Well, I don't know...

35:00.212 --> 35:02.950
I wanted to see you.
And wanted you to meet my sons

35:03.213 --> 35:04.126
That's better

35:06.036 --> 35:10.460
Christian, behave yourself.
We are not at home.

35:11.308 --> 35:13.564
This is Samuel.
Sami, say hello

35:15.171 --> 35:16.116
Hi, Sami.

35:19.236 --> 35:22.619
- Why are you in bed?
- Because he can't move, I already explained it to you

35:23.754 --> 35:25.068
Is it true you can't feel a thing?

35:29.321 --> 35:33.186
What happens to you now?
Are you hot?

35:34.067 --> 35:36.250
Is just that with this weather you never know.

35:36.913 --> 35:44.113
We are on strike because there's been a month
since they paid us. So it's like Sunday for us

35:44.465 --> 35:48.912
I made the breakfast, we took the bus
and we came to see you

35:52.145 --> 35:53.335
- What happened?
- Nothing

35:56.895 --> 35:58.735
Samuel, why are you crying now?

36:01.343 --> 36:02.015
Manuela...

36:05.918 --> 36:07.951
What do you think about all this?
Tell me the truth

36:09.103 --> 36:10.486
What do I think about what?

36:14.071 --> 36:15.869
That your brother in law wants to die

36:17.565 --> 36:18.805
That�s what he wants

36:20.749 --> 36:21.533
Ok, but...

36:24.494 --> 36:28.708
...but you. What would you want?
What would you prefer?

36:30.245 --> 36:32.493
What I prefer has no importance

36:33.339 --> 36:36.227
Ramon wants to die.
Everything is quite clear for me

36:39.092 --> 36:42.404
- Would you like to see a thing?
- A thing?

36:43.546 --> 36:44.738
Yes, come

36:50.655 --> 36:53.503
- Christian, leave that alone
- Leave me alone!

36:54.447 --> 36:56.278
I'm going to leave your ass like
a ripe tomato

37:18.701 --> 37:20.148
Almost all of them are poems

37:24.204 --> 37:25.725
I never threw anything away

37:26.381 --> 37:29.996
I couldn't do it.
It takes a lot of effort for him to write them

37:30.155 --> 37:32.013
And his handwriting...
Look...

37:35.723 --> 37:37.787
I never saw such a beautiful handwriting

37:42.402 --> 37:45.802
- Ok. I'll be downstairs
- Manuela

37:47.251 --> 37:49.026
Is going to take me a while to read all of this

37:49.274 --> 37:53.386
- Would you mind telling Ramon that...
- That you went to the beach

37:54.865 --> 37:57.489
- ...to take a walk
- Thanks

38:05.633 --> 38:08.673
Of course it is the first and the
last time I bring you here

38:09.513 --> 38:11.440
- But mom, that guy is faking it
- The last time!

38:19.399 --> 38:22.145
- Did she tell you when would she be back?
- Just to take a walk

38:22.921 --> 38:24.513
That way you can take a nap

38:26.538 --> 38:29.376
- You can't complain
- Why?

38:31.463 --> 38:35.416
Not a minute passes by that a woman
comes into this house. Are you building a harem?

38:38.519 --> 38:42.230
Manuela, you know I�m only married to one

38:42.880 --> 38:45.071
Yes, with Death

39:02.028 --> 39:03.908
- Do you want anything else?
- No

42:25.040 --> 42:28.848
They told me you were here.
And I came flying

43:31.947 --> 43:33.098
Manuela...

43:44.051 --> 43:45.057
Hi

43:46.657 --> 43:48.480
How was the walk?

43:50.201 --> 43:51.489
I've been reading Ramon

43:53.144 --> 43:55.169
I've been reading all that you have done.

43:57.688 --> 43:58.920
You know what?

44:02.767 --> 44:03.938
What you have written...

44:06.321 --> 44:07.393
...is wonderful

44:10.584 --> 44:13.920
So...you are not only a lawyer,
but also a writer

44:15.842 --> 44:17.280
Ok. Make fun of me.

44:18.471 --> 44:20.015
But I tell you that this can be published

44:20.311 --> 44:23.758
Of course it can be published.
Nowadays you can publish almost anything

44:24.718 --> 44:26.815
I don't see a better way to support your demand

44:29.911 --> 44:30.687
Is your voice

44:33.309 --> 44:38.508
Look Julia, this was more clear
at the beginning

44:39.917 --> 44:44.914
You came here with a purpose, to help me

44:45.938 --> 44:51.586
Instead of that, you start questioning everything.
Looking for reasons...

44:52.513 --> 44:56.145
You get inside my feelings...

45:06.520 --> 45:08.151
Do you want me to leave?

45:10.735 --> 45:15.279
What I want right now is a cigarette, please

45:20.230 --> 45:20.982
Sure.

45:24.901 --> 45:26.046
I'll go get them

46:05.880 --> 46:07.846
Julia, what happened?

46:13.745 --> 46:14.809
Are you alright?

46:20.664 --> 46:21.697
Manuela!

46:43.414 --> 46:48.645
Is not about what happened,
but about what could happen.

46:51.229 --> 46:56.029
Because...one day...is the legs

46:56.244 --> 47:00.008
But on another day...

47:01.824 --> 47:04.744
...you can go blind

47:07.177 --> 47:08.575
And you can get better or not

47:10.553 --> 47:11.840
I had been lucky so far

47:15.230 --> 47:16.823
but then comes the next stroke

47:18.487 --> 47:21.431
and the next, and the next

47:21.998 --> 47:24.662
and no one can tell you when
or how they are going to be

47:24.974 --> 47:28.062
No one can tell what is going
to be left of you if anything at all

47:30.029 --> 47:31.309
Your husband is very optimistic

47:33.933 --> 47:37.637
And what is it good for?
If there's not even medication for this

47:40.643 --> 47:47.075
What's the point of standing up, working, getting your
hopes up if at the end comes the next stroke and you fall again

47:47.315 --> 47:49.003
and you feel again like shit

47:50.242 --> 47:51.713
Is ridiculous

47:56.074 --> 47:58.257
I called you because I want
to become a member of DMD

48:04.402 --> 48:07.248
I had thought about it 2 years
ago when I was diagnosed

48:09.423 --> 48:10.967
but I backed out at the last moment

48:11.911 --> 48:13.030
But not after this...

48:15.703 --> 48:16.702
...not after this.

48:17.759 --> 48:19.566
I can't take it anymore.
This isn't life

48:26.998 --> 48:28.157
Does your husband know?

48:31.164 --> 48:32.805
- I don't know if I want to tell him
- You should

48:37.212 --> 48:39.950
Fear is a very powerful weapon.

48:42.491 --> 48:44.740
Fear doesn't give you freedom to decide

48:45.573 --> 48:48.155
What you are telling me right now
is a product of that fear

48:49.130 --> 48:53.675
Maybe, later, you will back out,
precisely out of fear

48:54.276 --> 48:56.354
Do not act based on fear.

48:56.422 --> 48:59.446
You are supposed to support people
that want to commit suicide, right?

48:59.561 --> 49:00.514
No.

49:03.425 --> 49:09.205
Do you think that I go around telling people with problems
that the best is to get out of the way

49:10.249 --> 49:17.084
No. What we support is freedom.
The freedom of those that want to live and those that want to die

49:17.192 --> 49:18.417
Is very different

49:19.496 --> 49:24.519
And CADASIL is a very fucked up disease, I agree

49:26.608 --> 49:29.200
But I only ask that you think it a little bit more

49:36.247 --> 49:37.552
Ramon, gave me this for you

49:45.889 --> 49:49.014
If you want, we can talk some other day about this

49:59.908 --> 50:00.923
How do you see her?

50:02.716 --> 50:03.716
Fine

50:05.235 --> 50:08.187
Really?
I also think she is fine

50:09.516 --> 50:13.891
- Ok. Nice to meet you
- Thanks for coming

50:14.507 --> 50:15.099
You are welcome

50:15.671 --> 50:17.810
- I'll stay a while longer
- OK

50:33.089 --> 50:36.944
Dear Julia...When Gen� told me that a lawyer wanted my case

50:38.456 --> 50:41.049
there was something that
influenced my decision

50:41.673 --> 50:45.054
and it was the fact that the lawyer
suffered a degenerative disease

50:45.783 --> 50:48.687
I thought that only someone in that
condition could really understand mine

50:50.142 --> 50:51.270
And shared my hell

50:51.735 --> 50:57.614
Now I know that living in that hell is sometimes
worth it, if one gets to meet people like you

51:01.134 --> 51:03.781
Is worth it to have shared a cigarette with them

51:04.326 --> 51:08.189
or, like right now, caressing them even if its just
by writing some foolishness like this

51:08.629 --> 51:11.068
And talking about foolishness,
I'm correcting my writings

51:11.637 --> 51:13.940
With the hope that you will come soon
and give me a hand

51:14.297 --> 51:17.851
For now, my nephew Javi is helping me
by copying them on his computer

51:18.676 --> 51:21.246
For the rest, life continues just the same, you know

51:21.902 --> 51:25.562
Manuela kept the whole month covering me
so next year doesn't catch me off guard

51:26.206 --> 51:31.829
Javi keeps fighting with his grandpa and sometimes
I make up little chores so they spend more time together

51:32.061 --> 51:36.356
This month some friends came to visit.
Some of them have been doing it for 25 years

51:36.805 --> 51:38.701
and that keeps surprising me

51:39.125 --> 51:41.061
They enjoy telling me their stories

51:42.387 --> 51:44.451
Do you remember Rosa?
The girl from the conserve factory.

51:44.796 --> 51:46.500
I think she found here some kind of refuge

51:46.843 --> 51:50.930
The other day she wanted to help Manuela to
change my clothes, and they ended up arguing

51:51.211 --> 51:56.969
I proved again that when you depend on someone
for everything, you lose your privacy

51:57.283 --> 52:03.683
Well...I hope to keep my little kingdom in order
until you can cheer me up with your presence

52:04.194 --> 52:04.970
A big hug.

52:13.393 --> 52:14.081
What's going on?

52:15.488 --> 52:16.641
Let's see. What does it say here?

52:19.014 --> 52:21.597
"No es asi la vida que va" (The life that goes is not like that)

52:21.758 --> 52:25.710
No sir. It has to say
"No es as� la vida. Qu� va" (Life is not like that. No way)

52:25.750 --> 52:28.649
- No
- Yes. And that "Qu�" has accent

52:28.905 --> 52:31.889
That "Qu�" has accent. Do you see it?
Right there.

52:33.216 --> 52:36.081
"Death is my friend,"
where's the colon?

52:37.209 --> 52:39.425
What are they teaching you in school?

52:40.272 --> 52:42.095
You have to pay attention to what I give you

52:43.063 --> 52:44.788
Even your grandpa would do it better

52:46.231 --> 52:49.302
Look Javi, if this is the way you are going to help
I rather you didn't do it, ok?

52:49.726 --> 52:51.296
Because you make me work twice

52:54.871 --> 52:56.839
Give me the stick.
Give me the stick

52:58.128 --> 53:00.430
Put a little more attention, ok?

53:11.718 --> 53:13.949
- Javi, what happened?
- Nothing

53:31.796 --> 53:34.707
Dear Ramon...please forgive me for taking so
long in answering your letter

53:35.450 --> 53:40.946
But the doctors have limited me the use of the computer
and in general, any activity that doesn't make me use my legs

53:41.913 --> 53:45.665
They assure me that I�ll be able to walk again
but they say that I shouldn't continue with your case

53:47.529 --> 53:50.121
In the physical therapy room there's a huge window

53:51.208 --> 53:55.449
Sometimes I imagine that I go through it and fly,
like you, over Barcelona

53:56.088 --> 54:00.009
I reach the sea and keep flying until I can only
see that endless line of water

54:01.360 --> 54:07.304
And think, foolish me, that if you do the same
from Corunna, maybe you'll go around the world again

54:07.655 --> 54:10.831
And we end up finding each other in
some part of the planet

54:12.951 --> 54:16.303
I identify with you when you mention
the lack of freedom and privacy

54:17.262 --> 54:21.235
I try to bear with it, mainly for my husband
that takes care of me with much dedication

54:22.134 --> 54:24.901
But at the same time, I refuse to fall
into this inertia

54:25.350 --> 54:29.746
where I just can be grateful for what is given because
I have no other choice but to accept it

54:29.878 --> 54:31.797
I wish I�ll be able to see you in a couple of months

54:32.029 --> 54:34.085
And I keep my promise of helping you
with the book

54:34.478 --> 54:38.988
Until then receive the thanks and
a hug from a very good friend

54:42.871 --> 54:47.502
I knew this could happen, I knew it.
We are going to have to try again

54:48.006 --> 54:50.670
No Mark, how can you say
that we have to try again?

55:02.098 --> 55:04.065
As if justice is so swift in
this country

55:07.803 --> 55:10.508
No. And now it is me the one
that has to tell him

55:28.277 --> 55:35.038
The demand of the tetraplegic Ramon Sampedro requesting the euthanasia
was rejected yesterday by the tribunals due to defects in its form

55:35.305 --> 55:38.909
The sentence says that the judicial process
should have been started in Corunna

55:39.493 --> 55:42.494
where he resides, and not in Barcelona

55:42.948 --> 55:49.162
Many voices have been raised due to this case
among them is priest's Francisco de Galdar

55:49.418 --> 55:50.692
tetraplegic like Ramon

55:51.276 --> 55:54.626
Ramon says he doesn't want to
live anymore, but I wonder

55:55.395 --> 56:03.057
isn't it possible that Ramon is asking of society,
of all of us, some kind of attention

56:03.474 --> 56:04.713
What is he talking about?

56:05.322 --> 56:10.841
Maybe is that the people that surround him doesn't
provide the love or support that he needs

56:11.649 --> 56:12.505
That moron

56:13.313 --> 56:16.632
Couldn�t it be possible that what Ramon is
asking is for more love?

56:17.393 --> 56:24.620
I would really like to talk to him and convince him
that there are many reasons to keep on living

56:25.687 --> 56:27.135
Aren't you going to school?

56:36.846 --> 56:38.279
I hope you are happy now!

56:39.726 --> 56:41.110
Our whole family humiliated
on television

56:43.847 --> 56:47.302
But keep it up, keep it up.
Until our faces fall out of embarrassment

56:48.541 --> 56:50.445
And you dad? Aren't you going to tell him anything?

56:50.861 --> 56:54.249
Don't involve dad in this.
Whatever you have to tell me, do it and be done with it

57:03.095 --> 57:06.236
I'm going to tell you something Ramon.
I am the older brother

57:06.308 --> 57:08.328
Listen to me, listen to me for a moment

57:08.419 --> 57:10.444
What if you have an accident tomorrow
and you die?

57:14.140 --> 57:15.010
Have you thought about it?

57:16.019 --> 57:19.618
What would happen to me?
I would have to take care of the family, right?

57:20.443 --> 57:24.674
Of your wife, your son, dad...
With that miserable pension of mine

57:25.826 --> 57:29.497
If I stay alive, I�ll make
things a lot more difficult

57:31.042 --> 57:34.978
I'm going to tell you something Ramon.
I am the older brother

57:35.233 --> 57:39.896
I am the older here. And while I�m alive,
no one is getting killed here

57:40.447 --> 57:43.440
No one in this house is getting killed.
Put that in your head, Ramon

57:43.863 --> 57:44.807
No one!

58:12.094 --> 58:15.852
- Ok, son. I'll leave
- See you tomorrow dad

58:35.435 --> 58:36.467
I'll go

58:39.451 --> 58:40.995
Hi Manuela, I came to see Ramon

58:41.487 --> 58:43.378
But, do you know what time it is?

58:43.626 --> 58:46.545
I know. I couldn't come sooner.
I'll explain it to Ramon

58:47.066 --> 58:50.748
I don't think he's in the mood of visits.
He had a bad day

58:51.306 --> 58:53.265
Why don't you come tomorrow?
Or the day after?

58:53.641 --> 58:54.513
It's important

58:55.860 --> 58:57.468
The conserve factory is closing

58:59.075 --> 59:02.099
That things are not going well.
That there's no money to pay us

59:02.827 --> 59:04.066
And that we are fired

59:04.386 --> 59:06.428
There's no right, damn it!

59:06.463 --> 59:07.391
There's no right.

59:11.536 --> 59:13.767
- Forgive me Ramon
- I have nothing to forgive

59:14.886 --> 59:18.870
Cry all you want.
I wish I could stand up and give you a hug

59:22.616 --> 59:24.830
Now that I had started to save some money

59:26.030 --> 59:28.862
I wanted to buy you a telescope
for the day of the Wise Men

59:29.182 --> 59:30.901
You don't have to buy me anything, Rosa

59:31.110 --> 59:33.126
I will get really mad if you spend one cent on me

59:33.493 --> 59:34.877
But I really wanted to

59:38.405 --> 59:41.365
- I wanted to give you something
- But why do you have to give me anything?

59:42.188 --> 59:44.796
Because you game me a lot Ramon,
you have no idea

59:52.283 --> 59:54.762
No man has never been so kind to me
as you have been

59:55.595 --> 59:57.051
Was it that bad?

01:00:06.218 --> 01:00:07.842
Now, I don't complicate things

01:00:08.546 --> 01:00:11.874
Now I know that the problem must be me, right

01:00:13.849 --> 01:00:15.738
That men doesn't like me or something

01:00:16.330 --> 01:00:18.864
What do you say, Rosa?
How is that even possible?

01:00:20.969 --> 01:00:23.696
Wasn't that what you told me when I came
here the first time?

01:00:24.521 --> 01:00:25.792
Frustrated woman, you said

01:00:27.872 --> 01:00:33.928
Yes, yes. If I called you that then,
now I call you strong and brave

01:00:34.623 --> 01:00:39.306
and kind and beautiful. And I call an imbecile
to those who can't see it

01:00:44.375 --> 01:00:45.502
Rosa, please stop it.

01:00:45.973 --> 01:00:48.445
You make me feel like a priest and
I hate them enough already

01:00:48.718 --> 01:00:50.821
Sit over here, come on sit.

01:00:56.645 --> 01:00:59.032
And leave my hand alone, you know I can't feel it

01:01:01.708 --> 01:01:03.596
My son says you are faking it.

01:01:11.698 --> 01:01:14.955
But you do feel your face, right?

01:01:28.433 --> 01:01:35.993
I wish I could help you.
I would do anything to help you.

01:01:36.273 --> 01:01:38.289
You would help me?

01:01:38.537 --> 01:01:39.761
Yes

01:01:41.544 --> 01:01:46.464
Don't worry. I have it all planned
so that no one ends up in jail

01:01:47.439 --> 01:01:49.990
I have some friends that are willing to help

01:01:51.512 --> 01:01:54.695
I only need one more.
Someone brave, like you

01:01:54.984 --> 01:01:58.448
No.

01:01:59.967 --> 01:02:01.519
Help you heal...

01:02:03.694 --> 01:02:05.438
not die

01:02:19.132 --> 01:02:22.699
Come un guys, let's go.

01:02:28.492 --> 01:02:30.060
Are you holding him?

01:02:37.507 --> 01:02:39.307
He won't fit through here

01:02:47.541 --> 01:02:50.658
Ramon says that he understands the situation
but that he won't come down

01:02:56.929 --> 01:02:59.465
Ok. It doesn't matter.
Brother Andres

01:03:04.688 --> 01:03:07.960
Go upstairs and tell Ramon

01:03:16.295 --> 01:03:21.942
...and since we are inside eternity.
Life doesn't belong to us...

01:03:22.391 --> 01:03:27.872
and we take to ridiculous extremes the
bourgeois definition of private property

01:03:30.237 --> 01:03:31.157
You are killing me

01:03:31.798 --> 01:03:35.421
But if Church was the first one in
secularize the private property

01:03:37.405 --> 01:03:38.608
- I can't tell him that
- How come?

01:03:39.239 --> 01:03:40.487
Should I tell him that?

01:03:43.807 --> 01:03:51.626
Freedom to choose my beliefs...no, his beliefs
and decide over his life

01:03:53.214 --> 01:03:54.766
Ok, now you tell him

01:03:57.446 --> 01:04:00.974
Why does the Church keep with such passion
that posture of terror of death?

01:04:01.573 --> 01:04:04.269
Because it knows that it would lose
a great amount of its customers

01:04:04.493 --> 01:04:06.701
if people lose their fear to the
Great Beyond

01:04:07.493 --> 01:04:13.789
He reminds you that according to the polls,
67% of the Spanish are in favor of euthanasia

01:04:14.069 --> 01:04:18.100
Very well, very well. Now you tell him
that moral issues are not resolved through polls

01:04:18.620 --> 01:04:23.003
Because most of the German people was
also in favor of Hitler

01:04:23.268 --> 01:04:25.612
Now he is going to compare me to Hitler.
That is very rude

01:04:26.203 --> 01:04:27.075
No, not that

01:04:29.563 --> 01:04:31.859
Ask him what does Hitler has to do with anything

01:04:32.863 --> 01:04:38.298
No wait...
Padre Francisco, do you hear me?

01:04:39.722 --> 01:04:41.818
Yes. Ramon I can hear you

01:04:42.433 --> 01:04:44.346
Why do you mix pears with apples?

01:04:45.361 --> 01:04:47.553
I hope you didn't come here to do demagoguery.

01:04:48.017 --> 01:04:50.256
Because you Jesuits know a lot about that.

01:04:50.585 --> 01:04:52.282
No, no. Of course not.

01:04:52.456 --> 01:04:55.512
But since you bring up demagoguery, my dear Ramon.

01:04:57.087 --> 01:05:01.479
Don't you think that what's really demagogic is
to say "Death with dignity"

01:05:02.975 --> 01:05:07.094
Why don't you leave the euphemisms aside and
call things by its name, with all its rawness

01:05:07.179 --> 01:05:08.679
"I take my life" and that's it...

01:05:09.758 --> 01:05:15.607
It keeps surprising me your interest in my life,
when the Institution that you represent

01:05:16.350 --> 01:05:23.029
accepts the death penalty and condemned for centuries
to the bonfire those who didn't think in the right way

01:05:23.133 --> 01:05:25.496
Now it is you the one doing demagoguery

01:05:25.597 --> 01:05:30.269
Yes of course, but leaving the euphemisms aside, as you say
that's what you would have done with me, right?

01:05:30.781 --> 01:05:32.140
Burn me alive

01:05:32.884 --> 01:05:34.812
Burn me for defending my freedom

01:05:35.798 --> 01:05:36.923
Ramon, my friend...

01:05:37.452 --> 01:05:38.131
Friend?

01:05:38.445 --> 01:05:41.475
Ramon, my friend. A freedom that
eliminates life is not freedom

01:05:41.892 --> 01:05:43.868
And a life that eliminates freedom is not life either

01:05:45.011 --> 01:05:47.620
Don't call me friend!
And leave me alone

01:05:53.594 --> 01:05:54.740
Come on. Let's go

01:05:59.947 --> 01:06:05.813
You...you that look like kind people,
give this man reasons to live

01:06:07.633 --> 01:06:12.888
Prove to him that life is not only
moving your arms and running around

01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:17.820
or kicking a ball.
Damn it! Life is something else, really

01:06:18.852 --> 01:06:22.292
Life is so much more.
Hear it from me.

01:06:25.595 --> 01:06:28.051
And what do you want us to do?

01:06:28.299 --> 01:06:30.347
That we gag him so he doesn't talk?

01:06:31.163 --> 01:06:33.746
Or that we put him to sleep with a
rattle like a little kid

01:06:36.874 --> 01:06:41.226
Look. you appeared on TV and
something that I can't take out of my head

01:06:41.897 --> 01:06:42.890
Manuela, leave it alone

01:06:43.312 --> 01:06:46.568
You said that Ramon's family didn't
give him enough love...

01:06:47.103 --> 01:06:51.105
you should know that in this house no one
stopped loving Ramon for one single day

01:06:51.552 --> 01:06:52.392
Not one day

01:06:54.345 --> 01:06:59.512
I've been looking after him for many years
and I love him like a son

01:07:03.822 --> 01:07:05.799
I don't know which one of you is right

01:07:06.606 --> 01:07:11.219
And I don't know if it's true what you say
about life belonging to God and not to us

01:07:13.344 --> 01:07:15.174
but I do know one thing

01:07:16.190 --> 01:07:18.541
you have a very big mouth

01:07:38.788 --> 01:07:42.163
Rosa, I told you that is not
necessary. I already shaved Ramon

01:07:42.396 --> 01:07:44.370
Yes, yes. But I know a better way

01:07:48.642 --> 01:07:49.619
Where do you have the soap?

01:07:52.683 --> 01:07:53.490
They're here

01:08:07.394 --> 01:08:10.456
I don't feel anything.
Are you sure there's a child in there?

01:08:10.816 --> 01:08:12.153
7 months old, darling

01:08:13.401 --> 01:08:15.621
- Well, he's not moving
- You're the one that doesn't move

01:08:15.776 --> 01:08:17.471
- Now, now, now
- See

01:08:18.649 --> 01:08:21.680
- He's happy to see you
- How are you going to call him?

01:08:21.975 --> 01:08:23.816
We still don't know

01:08:24.854 --> 01:08:29.254
Well, call him Ramon and that way one day
when he asks why, you can tell him my story

01:08:30.270 --> 01:08:31.573
Is better if you tell him

01:08:37.622 --> 01:08:40.182
There's someone else who will
be really happy to see you

01:08:45.805 --> 01:08:49.180
- No, no. Not like that
- Grandpa, shut up

01:08:59.435 --> 01:09:02.939
- How come you didn't say anything?
- We wanted to surprise you

01:09:03.587 --> 01:09:05.962
This a great Wise Men's day present

01:09:06.135 --> 01:09:08.370
I'm going to open the windows,
it's really hot in here

01:09:08.675 --> 01:09:10.867
We better get out and
leave you alone for a while

01:09:20.328 --> 01:09:21.578
How are you sailor?

01:09:28.096 --> 01:09:29.904
- Do you drink coffee Mark?
- Yes, please

01:09:30.313 --> 01:09:32.953
- How are you Rosa?
- Fine

01:09:33.288 --> 01:09:35.481
Ramon told me that you had found a new job

01:09:36.194 --> 01:09:38.144
Yes, caring for some elderly people

01:09:40.590 --> 01:09:42.335
Does that woman is going to stay long?

01:09:43.608 --> 01:09:46.502
A couple of weeks, depending on how
long the book takes

01:09:47.975 --> 01:09:52.015
Well, I guess I won't be able to shave him.
See you some other time

01:09:52.303 --> 01:09:53.341
Bye Rosa

01:09:54.647 --> 01:09:57.702
Ok, the judges have their hands
tied because of the legislation

01:09:58.885 --> 01:10:01.265
We are going to try to
obtain a statement

01:10:01.841 --> 01:10:05.361
where we recommend to the government
changes to the penal code

01:10:05.713 --> 01:10:08.577
- The government?
- The government is there to serve us, Javi

01:10:08.874 --> 01:10:10.057
Your uncle is more important

01:10:10.769 --> 01:10:13.824
The jury will not dare agree with us,
we already know that

01:10:14.834 --> 01:10:17.176
But we cannot fail on the
regional audience

01:10:20.911 --> 01:10:22.975
Javier, help me with the cows

01:10:31.807 --> 01:10:35.302
We have to convince the judges that
Ramon is complete sane and lucid

01:10:36.318 --> 01:10:39.293
It would help us a lot
if he would make a declaration

01:10:39.797 --> 01:10:43.333
Manuela, we have to take Ramon
out of the house

01:10:46.253 --> 01:10:48.205
Can you tell me what were
you doing in there?

01:10:49.432 --> 01:10:51.565
Do you know what are they talking about?
What they want?

01:10:52.149 --> 01:10:53.900
And what do I do?
Lock myself up in the room?

01:10:54.099 --> 01:10:55.693
Do you understand what they really want?

01:10:58.396 --> 01:11:00.164
What happens if he wins the trial?

01:11:01.123 --> 01:11:07.170
Your uncle gets injected and dies, like a dog.
And you never see him again

01:11:08.028 --> 01:11:09.346
You will never see him again, Javier

01:11:10.039 --> 01:11:11.398
Or do you think death is so great?

01:11:12.806 --> 01:11:14.662
Please use your head

01:11:15.119 --> 01:11:17.045
Death is a very serious thing, you hear me?

01:11:17.709 --> 01:11:20.593
- Your uncle dies and you won't see him again.
- Leave me alone

01:11:27.966 --> 01:11:31.033
Is not that he doesn't feel like it, he
just doesn't want to use the chair

01:11:32.685 --> 01:11:36.180
Taking him out of the house once or twice
a year is an accomplishment

01:11:36.420 --> 01:11:40.540
Well, this one has to be one of those times.
It is very important that Ramon takes this trip.

01:11:42.541 --> 01:11:43.868
And when would that be?

01:11:45.307 --> 01:11:48.012
I estimate that the trial will take place in the spring

01:11:48.204 --> 01:11:50.499
So we still have time to propose it to him.

01:11:51.930 --> 01:11:55.234
There's only one thing worse than the death of a son

01:11:56.706 --> 01:11:58.394
and that is he wanting to die

01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:27.832
Well, let's get to work

01:13:17.922 --> 01:13:24.049
"...get inside of you, eternally,
my seducer lover, beloved sea"

01:13:27.065 --> 01:13:29.009
Can you really smell the sea from here?

01:13:29.234 --> 01:13:31.784
Yes, and sometimes in the morning if there's wind

01:13:33.416 --> 01:13:37.056
and the window is open,
I can smell it as if I was there

01:13:38.432 --> 01:13:39.672
You have a very good nose

01:13:39.889 --> 01:13:44.416
Smells are probably what cause me
more intense sensations

01:13:46.256 --> 01:13:47.670
More fantasies

01:13:51.238 --> 01:13:53.126
...your smell, for example.

01:13:56.510 --> 01:13:58.151
My smell

01:13:59.734 --> 01:14:04.606
Yes, is the first thing I imagine when
I day dream about you

01:14:07.137 --> 01:14:08.193
Really?

01:14:10.081 --> 01:14:13.082
- And what are those dreams about?
- Just things

01:14:15.672 --> 01:14:17.873
They all have one thing in common...

01:14:19.015 --> 01:14:21.443
In all of them I can move...

01:14:23.494 --> 01:14:30.778
and I stand up and travel wherever
I imagine you are at that moment

01:14:33.039 --> 01:14:35.558
And if I imagine that you are here, for example

01:14:38.190 --> 01:14:40.383
I just get close to you

01:14:42.782 --> 01:14:45.461
And do what I have been
wishing to do so many times

01:14:45.997 --> 01:14:51.093
Then your smell becomes
stronger and I get dizzy

01:14:53.013 --> 01:14:58.571
I can feel your heart beat
then I feel your hands

01:15:01.148 --> 01:15:05.332
And then I lose my mind...
I lose my mind

01:15:37.904 --> 01:15:38.994
Is the water ok?

01:16:01.038 --> 01:16:02.206
Julia...

01:16:04.510 --> 01:16:06.173
Julia, are you awake?

01:16:08.798 --> 01:16:09.581
Yes

01:16:12.092 --> 01:16:12.997
I can't sleep

01:16:15.988 --> 01:16:17.060
Why is that

01:16:19.004 --> 01:16:21.956
I have an itching in one leg,
can you come and scratch it?

01:16:23.108 --> 01:16:23.955
...the leg

01:16:43.603 --> 01:16:45.115
I brought him some "filloas"

01:16:46.738 --> 01:16:48.602
- I know he likes them - Rosa,
please listen -I made them

01:16:50.217 --> 01:16:55.007
I've told you that you don't have to cook him
anything, or bathe him or shave him. Nothing

01:16:55.103 --> 01:16:56.679
I take care of Ramon.
Get it?

01:16:58.887 --> 01:17:02.606
- Ok, then I want to hear it from him
- No, he already told me

01:17:04.159 --> 01:17:05.982
Besides, he is very busy now.

01:17:07.871 --> 01:17:09.334
Is he with her?

01:17:15.885 --> 01:17:19.950
I wish I was a lawyer too.
But of course...

01:17:28.636 --> 01:17:32.596
- Don't cry Rosa, don't cry
- If you don't want to see me, please tell me

01:17:33.260 --> 01:17:36.124
- Of course I want to see you
- It doesn't look that way

01:17:36.547 --> 01:17:37.787
Really, what are you...

01:17:40.394 --> 01:17:42.283
Rosa...
Rosa...

01:17:43.995 --> 01:17:45.018
She hung up

01:17:48.115 --> 01:17:51.721
Do you mind dialing the number again
and giving me a minute alone

01:18:04.336 --> 01:18:06.744
What's going on between you two, Ramon?

01:18:11.037 --> 01:18:12.333
But Julia...

01:18:14.628 --> 01:18:16.564
Why would I need to explain anything to you?

01:18:17.497 --> 01:18:21.859
I don't understand why you answer me like that,
because then I don't know what I�m doing here.

01:18:24.479 --> 01:18:27.886
Unless of course, you think that there's
nothing happening here

01:18:28.080 --> 01:18:30.327
The kiss you gave me yesterday meant nothing?

01:18:33.886 --> 01:18:35.126
Look at you

01:18:37.351 --> 01:18:38.918
Look at you sitting there

01:18:40.822 --> 01:18:42.278
Look at you

01:18:43.429 --> 01:18:45.494
And now look at me

01:18:48.045 --> 01:18:49.783
Where are we going Julia?

01:18:51.685 --> 01:18:53.181
Look at us

01:18:54.644 --> 01:18:56.189
I haven't finished

01:18:58.340 --> 01:18:59.876
What do you think?

01:19:00.804 --> 01:19:02.922
That I don't think about what happened to me?

01:19:04.084 --> 01:19:06.930
Of course, I think about it. Frequently.

01:19:09.220 --> 01:19:11.651
Every single day. It's like a nightmare.

01:19:14.722 --> 01:19:18.474
And I know that it will only get worse and worse
until I end up like a vegetable

01:19:19.010 --> 01:19:22.730
So I have reached a conclusion and I rather...

01:19:32.048 --> 01:19:33.330
I'm going to do it Ramon.

01:19:37.304 --> 01:19:39.748
I'm going to take my own life

01:19:48.684 --> 01:19:54.403
But before I do it, if you want to, my love...

01:19:57.187 --> 01:19:59.634
I would like to help you.

01:20:04.745 --> 01:20:06.288
Leave together...

01:20:12.665 --> 01:20:16.425
You don't say anything?
You didn't expect this.

01:20:20.248 --> 01:20:21.584
When?

01:20:24.008 --> 01:20:28.631
I don't know. We are almost done
with the book and...

01:20:31.103 --> 01:20:38.886
I'll go to Barcelona and look for an editor
so you can publish it.

01:20:39.279 --> 01:20:47.646
And then I�ll come back with the first copy.
That same day, Ramon. That same day.

01:20:49.516 --> 01:20:53.227
Listen to me, in the worst case scenario
we would win the public support.

01:20:53.468 --> 01:20:55.907
If the verdict is negative the
discussion will be more heated

01:20:56.293 --> 01:21:00.362
- Don't be stupid...I can't
understand... - Are you ok? - Yes, Yes

01:21:01.803 --> 01:21:03.250
News, what news?

01:21:05.267 --> 01:21:09.825
Mark, please be careful. It's ok, it's ok.
What happened Ramon?

01:21:10.012 --> 01:21:11.292
We are here.

01:21:13.555 --> 01:21:18.788
I understand Ramon, I understand.
But that doesn't matter

01:21:19.035 --> 01:21:26.491
Listen to me, if no one takes this step. If everyone hides their
heads and doesn't even try to confront the state, the judges...

01:21:41.280 --> 01:21:44.528
And what do we do now Manuela?
I mean, with the trip to Corunna.

01:21:44.960 --> 01:21:46.833
Do I go there and waste my time?

01:21:47.168 --> 01:21:49.145
Knowing that they won't listen to me.

01:21:49.608 --> 01:22:01.199
Well, I think that today it is a waste of time but
maybe tomorrow it could be useful for someone else

01:22:11.950 --> 01:22:14.121
Ok. Let's go and see those judges in the face

01:22:19.508 --> 01:22:22.444
- Javi, where is the chair
- The chair?

01:22:23.445 --> 01:22:25.150
I don't know, it's probably in the back.

01:22:25.484 --> 01:22:31.148
Well, I want you to take it out and clean it up. Then bring
grandpa and I�ll explain. We are going to make some changes

01:22:33.235 --> 01:22:34.963
Are going to put a motor?

01:22:34.987 --> 01:22:38.868
- You have to cut here and here
- Let the back move, right?

01:22:39.156 --> 01:22:47.388
You have to cut these pipes down here and then join them
with bolts so they move as hinges. Are you getting this?

01:22:48.162 --> 01:22:50.324
- Yes, yes
- And you dad?

01:22:50.515 --> 01:22:54.915
Your going to be lying down son.
You might fall sleep at the trial

01:22:55.083 --> 01:22:57.892
Is not like they're saying anything interesting, dad.

01:23:15.713 --> 01:23:17.241
Die to Live

01:23:19.489 --> 01:23:21.747
LETTERS FROM HELL

01:23:22.298 --> 01:23:24.438
You should put a pillow here
to support my head

01:23:24.590 --> 01:23:27.370
In case I fall backwards and break my neck

01:23:27.602 --> 01:23:33.129
Hey, Javi. Do you get it? Break
my neck... Break my neck...

01:23:47.072 --> 01:23:48.808
Grandpa

01:23:49.576 --> 01:23:52.832
Look, if you're going to help me like that,
is better if you do nothing

01:24:11.645 --> 01:24:15.085
- Am I tying you too tight?
- You're asking me?

01:24:22.604 --> 01:24:25.965
Wait a moment please.
Ramon

01:24:26.204 --> 01:24:28.805
Manuela, please.
As if I don't look ridiculous enough

01:24:29.092 --> 01:24:30.844
Better this than catching a cold

01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:36.651
And don't you dare, taking it off

01:24:42.242 --> 01:24:43.882
You are Ramon Sampedro, right?

01:24:45.083 --> 01:24:48.050
I really wished it was me the
one to take you.

01:25:50.071 --> 01:25:54.504
Living is a right,
not an obligation!

01:25:54.505 --> 01:25:59.476
- Look at all the people here
- Who did we kill, eh?

01:26:00.426 --> 01:26:04.882
Ramon, do you feel alone because you
are the only Spanish to have requested euthanasia?

01:26:05.162 --> 01:26:11.922
Yes, well, the first one in requesting it in a public manner.
But this has been happening for many years.

01:26:12.130 --> 01:26:14.257
What do you expect from the judges?
What are you going to tell them?

01:26:15.401 --> 01:26:20.880
I just want to tell them that
I�m completely sane and lucid

01:26:22.638 --> 01:26:24.069
Silence

01:26:29.613 --> 01:26:30.789
Can we talk later?

01:26:31.564 --> 01:26:32.677
Silence, please

01:26:34.971 --> 01:26:38.763
In a state declared as lay and that recognizes
the right to the private property

01:26:38.931 --> 01:26:43.899
and which constitution expresses also the right
not to suffer tortures or degrading treatments

01:26:44.451 --> 01:26:48.651
is correct to say, that whomever sees his position as
degrading, as in Ramon Sampedro's case,

01:26:49.561 --> 01:26:51.746
should be able to decide over his own life

01:26:52.075 --> 01:26:57.154
in fact, no one that attempts suicide
and survives is judged afterwards

01:26:58.338 --> 01:27:03.033
but...
when you need the help of someone else

01:27:04.033 --> 01:27:07.617
to die with dignity, then the state interferes with
the freedom of the people and tells them

01:27:07.808 --> 01:27:10.713
that the life they are living is not theirs,
that they can't make decisions about it

01:27:10.970 --> 01:27:15.008
This, Your Honor, can only be done based on
metaphysical beliefs, or religious

01:27:16.416 --> 01:27:18.975
In a state, I repeat...

01:27:20.216 --> 01:27:22.071
that is declared lay

01:27:23.270 --> 01:27:28.015
Your Honor, I ask for a legal answer,
but above all, rational

01:27:28.759 --> 01:27:30.310
and human

01:27:32.646 --> 01:27:38.740
And now, with your permission,
Ramon Sampedro would like to read something

01:27:40.110 --> 01:27:41.717
Overruled

01:27:42.157 --> 01:27:46.158
My client want to address you directly so you
hear from his own voice...

01:27:46.389 --> 01:27:49.028
You know perfectly well the process

01:27:49.644 --> 01:27:52.165
Of course I know it, I know it perfectly

01:27:53.180 --> 01:27:57.492
But I didn't know that it was so irrelevant
for you to give three minutes of your time

01:27:57.539 --> 01:27:58.227
Three...

01:27:59.468 --> 01:28:01.715
To listen to a man that has been waiting
for 28 years

01:28:01.892 --> 01:28:04.020
If you want to change the process...

01:28:04.323 --> 01:28:05.675
change the laws

01:28:06.892 --> 01:28:08.635
Yes, of course.
I know that already.

01:28:09.962 --> 01:28:11.771
This case is ready for a sentence.

01:28:25.210 --> 01:28:28.657
Well...I knew you were not going
to take it seriously.

01:28:29.484 --> 01:28:34.080
That's what all men do. Laugh at me.
You were not going to be different

01:28:34.337 --> 01:28:38.776
Rosa, forgive me. Is just that lately
a little of everything happens to me

01:28:40.512 --> 01:28:42.079
- And...I�m a little overwhelmed.
- Why?

01:28:42.790 --> 01:28:45.224
Is not allowed to fall in love
with a tetraplegic or what?

01:28:45.399 --> 01:28:46.600
Is it that weird?

01:28:48.206 --> 01:28:54.447
Well, maybe we should clear up some things.
Specially if we are talking about something as complex as love.

01:28:54.670 --> 01:28:56.439
- Complex?
- Yes Rosa, complex.

01:28:56.943 --> 01:29:03.646
No matter how much you tell me that you love me,
I will never be sure of how real is your love

01:29:03.925 --> 01:29:09.433
or if it's just an idealization of a man you wanted
to find but couldn't or didn't last.

01:29:09.605 --> 01:29:13.317
But what are you talking about Ramon?
Don't try to confuse me

01:29:13.516 --> 01:29:17.924
Either you love or you don't.
You can't rationalize love

01:29:21.766 --> 01:29:25.340
Well, if that's the case, what do you want me to do?
You want me to move in with you?

01:29:26.030 --> 01:29:28.493
For me is enough to know that
I can visit you from time to time

01:29:28.782 --> 01:29:31.301
Of course you can.
Of course you can

01:29:32.887 --> 01:29:34.861
Yes, but for how long?

01:29:36.309 --> 01:29:39.772
Rosa. You wouldn't ask me
to stay alive for you, right?

01:29:41.157 --> 01:29:42.884
What if I told you that...

01:29:47.444 --> 01:29:49.316
that you give me strength to live Ramon

01:29:49.692 --> 01:29:52.563
Wait wait. Stop this thing for a moment

01:29:53.635 --> 01:29:54.875
Sit over there.

01:29:58.923 --> 01:30:03.811
- Let's see. Do you love your children?
- Of course I do.

01:30:04.811 --> 01:30:06.850
Well, there you have the strength to live

01:30:07.481 --> 01:30:10.033
Don't give me that responsibility Rosa

01:30:10.258 --> 01:30:14.689
Is that what you call love?
Keep me here against my will?

01:30:15.537 --> 01:30:16.736
Look...

01:30:17.904 --> 01:30:22.464
The person that really loves me is
the one that will help me die.

01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:26.158
That is love, Rosa

01:30:31.807 --> 01:30:35.895
Dear Julia...yesterday I received the sentence
of the provincial audience

01:30:36.607 --> 01:30:42.699
the judges understand that I want to die, but
remind me that to help me, would be punishable by law

01:30:43.222 --> 01:30:46.118
In other times, this would have affected me a lot

01:30:46.470 --> 01:30:51.047
Pushing me into that alley without exit where
days and nights never end

01:30:51.925 --> 01:30:56.820
But now I feel that everything is rushing by
and that the publication of the book will happen any day now

01:30:58.221 --> 01:31:01.448
And with it you will return Julia.
My Juliet...

01:31:02.140 --> 01:31:05.228
It will be the sweetest death that I could ever imagine

01:31:05.436 --> 01:31:07.677
It will be love, pure and shared

01:31:08.100 --> 01:31:12.596
And it will be the return to balance.
Finally to balance

01:31:13.451 --> 01:31:14.891
A kiss, my dear friend

01:32:12.057 --> 01:32:13.436
Ok, see you later

01:32:23.540 --> 01:32:24.812
Should I open it?

01:32:28.956 --> 01:32:30.484
Is the book!

01:32:32.593 --> 01:32:35.410
Look, is the book.
You are on the cover

01:32:42.022 --> 01:32:43.804
It smells great

01:32:50.481 --> 01:32:51.650
Is for you

01:32:55.634 --> 01:32:56.945
I'm going to show it to mom

01:33:27.485 --> 01:33:35.541
Why...why...
why can't I be happy with this life?

01:33:35.717 --> 01:33:37.750
I'm going to give you a tranquilizer

01:33:37.838 --> 01:33:41.366
Why do I want to die?
Why do I want to die?

01:33:52.436 --> 01:33:53.685
Give me two more Manuela.

01:33:54.317 --> 01:33:56.524
Manuela, for crying out loud, two more
pills are not going to kill me

01:33:56.866 --> 01:33:57.995
Give me two more

01:34:04.673 --> 01:34:05.964
You'll feel better soon

01:34:48.862 --> 01:34:52.054
- How do you feel?
- Fine

01:34:53.493 --> 01:34:54.639
What time is it?

01:34:54.901 --> 01:34:57.633
11:00 am. I didn't want to wake you up today

01:35:00.069 --> 01:35:02.365
The girl from Boiro has called three times already

01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:04.868
What did she want?

01:35:05.612 --> 01:35:08.388
She says she has to talk to you about
something important

01:35:08.995 --> 01:35:13.915
- For her it is always important
- Dial the number for me please

01:35:15.067 --> 01:35:17.762
Are you going to call her?
Why don't you wait for her to call back?

01:35:17.939 --> 01:35:22.050
But she can barely pay her phone bill.
Dial the number please

01:35:24.707 --> 01:35:27.890
Of course Ramon.
You always so kind

01:35:34.570 --> 01:35:36.897
- Ramon?
- What's going Rosa?

01:35:38.208 --> 01:35:40.136
I need to see you. I have to talk to you

01:35:40.553 --> 01:35:44.522
- You said I should call you before visiting you
- Yes. Did something happened?

01:35:45.560 --> 01:35:47.152
Can I come now?

01:35:48.887 --> 01:35:54.219
Look Ramon, you said you had a plan or something

01:35:55.810 --> 01:36:00.394
That you had figured out a way of doing what you want to do,
if the judges decided against you

01:36:00.570 --> 01:36:02.297
Yes, Rosa, but I already asked you to
forgive me, right?

01:36:02.603 --> 01:36:03.882
I told you to forget about it

01:36:04.249 --> 01:36:05.754
Yes.
But I can't

01:36:05.969 --> 01:36:07.249
I can't, you know

01:36:07.881 --> 01:36:14.488
Because last month the audience said no.
And you are still thinking about doing it

01:36:14.689 --> 01:36:17.888
Is that what worries you?
That I get my way?

01:36:18.977 --> 01:36:22.001
- So, are you going to do it?
- Is not that easy, Rosa. But don't worry

01:36:22.768 --> 01:36:24.625
You will be the last person to find out.

01:36:32.608 --> 01:36:33.815
Ramon...

01:36:35.431 --> 01:36:41.951
Is that I realized...
I understood what you said in Corunna.

01:36:43.102 --> 01:36:46.398
"The person that really loves me will
be the one to help me"

01:36:46.782 --> 01:36:49.486
I'm completely sure about what I feel Ramon

01:36:50.598 --> 01:36:52.406
I love you

01:36:56.380 --> 01:36:58.269
Do you want me to help you?

01:37:01.340 --> 01:37:02.661
Rosa...

01:37:03.516 --> 01:37:09.243
I'm not joking Ramon.
Do you want me to help you?

01:37:14.179 --> 01:37:17.186
But what are you going to tell him?
Jose wait...

01:37:20.755 --> 01:37:22.419
Did you hear me!
I will not allow this

01:37:22.658 --> 01:37:26.649
And what are you going to do?
Strap me to the bed?

01:37:28.339 --> 01:37:31.241
Or are you going to fill me with sleeping pills
like they used to do at the hospital?

01:37:31.505 --> 01:37:33.220
- No one is going to prevent me of getting out of here
- I will

01:37:33.420 --> 01:37:34.780
- Not even you
- I will

01:37:35.188 --> 01:37:36.524
Will see about that!

01:37:36.804 --> 01:37:38.651
Or is it that I mean nothing in this house?

01:37:39.101 --> 01:37:41.284
I am the older brother
I am the head of the family

01:37:41.725 --> 01:37:44.035
Do you think that means anything to me?

01:37:45.543 --> 01:37:46.644
At my age?

01:37:47.427 --> 01:37:50.994
For me what counts is what people have in their
heads, and you have nothing in yours

01:37:52.042 --> 01:37:56.507
I will not be a slave of your ignorance
anymore or of your prude conscience

01:37:56.689 --> 01:37:59.363
An what about me?
I am also a slave

01:38:00.529 --> 01:38:02.858
How do you think I felt when I left the sea?

01:38:03.545 --> 01:38:06.537
All my life here, living out of this
fucking orchard

01:38:08.104 --> 01:38:10.784
To be with you.
To be only with you

01:38:11.400 --> 01:38:14.929
Me, my wife and my son.
All slaves!

01:38:32.973 --> 01:38:36.549
- Hello
- Hello

01:38:39.667 --> 01:38:42.507
- Your uncle is going to Boiro
- Boiro?

01:38:43.466 --> 01:38:44.794
What for?

01:38:45.970 --> 01:38:47.674
To spend some time there, he says

01:38:48.857 --> 01:38:51.594
He's leaving with that woman, Rosa

01:38:55.129 --> 01:38:58.401
- Are they getting married?
- No they're not

01:39:06.201 --> 01:39:07.384
What is that about you leaving?

01:39:09.159 --> 01:39:10.200
For how long?

01:39:12.567 --> 01:39:14.608
I want to give you my book.
It's over there.

01:39:18.120 --> 01:39:22.462
- But aren't there any more, or what?
- Yes of course, but that one is the first copy

01:39:24.447 --> 01:39:25.863
Open it at the bookmark

01:39:28.637 --> 01:39:32.181
- "To my son"?
- Yes. Read it please.

01:39:34.166 --> 01:39:35.062
To my son

01:39:36.038 --> 01:39:38.341
Forgive me son for not being born

01:39:38.885 --> 01:39:40.469
It wasn't my fault to leave you behind

01:39:41.485 --> 01:39:44.317
It were the roses the ones afraid

01:39:45.236 --> 01:39:47.396
Forgive me for not had been able to play with you

01:39:48.133 --> 01:39:50.917
I don't know if you were born after I passed

01:39:51.252 --> 01:39:52.949
Remember always that I still love you

01:39:53.837 --> 01:39:56.324
Give a kiss to your mother from me

01:39:56.526 --> 01:39:57.862
And don't keep any resentments towards me

01:39:58.214 --> 01:39:59.175
Is not good to hate.

01:39:59.758 --> 01:40:00.879
So...did you get it?

01:40:01.710 --> 01:40:03.277
- Yes
- Let's see

01:40:04.358 --> 01:40:11.813
Well, it's about a son you never had and
this is like you are speaking to him

01:40:12.821 --> 01:40:14.596
And you ask for forgiveness for not having him

01:40:15.308 --> 01:40:17.082
Ok. But what did I added down there?

01:40:20.636 --> 01:40:24.675
- "To Javier"
- So? - So what?

01:40:26.196 --> 01:40:28.122
Don't you see what I�m trying to say?

01:40:29.938 --> 01:40:31.458
But I�m not your son

01:40:31.746 --> 01:40:33.107
Of course not...

01:40:33.261 --> 01:40:36.267
But if I�m dedicating you that poem,
is for a reason, no?

01:40:39.794 --> 01:40:41.378
But I�m not your son

01:40:41.674 --> 01:40:45.996
I don't know what is that they teach you at school.
Get out of here. Get out.

01:40:46.886 --> 01:40:48.429
You are all so weird

01:40:55.628 --> 01:40:58.459
Ramon? How are you?
Wait a moment, I can't hear you

01:41:01.306 --> 01:41:05.378
- Tell me dear
- I'm leaving tomorrow

01:41:05.635 --> 01:41:08.116
Yes, Rosa told me this afternoon.
I'm sure you are impatient

01:41:08.546 --> 01:41:09.251
A little

01:41:10.371 --> 01:41:14.242
Hey Ramon, I�ve been researching
about that thing you know...

01:41:15.171 --> 01:41:17.641
- What? - Well that
thing... - The powder?

01:41:18.106 --> 01:41:25.745
Yes, the powder. You have to calculate an exact dose of 200 mg.
But it is probable that it is a little painful...just so you know.

01:41:25.945 --> 01:41:35.976
Gen�. I think is best if you forget about all this.
It worries me that someday you could be implicated in this.

01:41:37.143 --> 01:41:44.655
In fact, that's why I�m calling, I want to
say good bye and we shouldn't talk again

01:41:45.303 --> 01:41:49.007
Is for your security.
You shouldn't even talk to Mark about this.

01:41:51.591 --> 01:42:01.069
- Yes, yes. I understand. So this is farewell.
- Is better this way

01:42:03.253 --> 01:42:08.093
Ok, ok...ok.
Let me tell you something...

01:42:08.845 --> 01:42:12.123
Ramon, think it through all the times that is necessary.

01:42:12.372 --> 01:42:21.051
Don't feel pressured. I mean, don't do it to set an example
or to not disappoint the public, or us or the association

01:42:21.468 --> 01:42:25.322
No one is pushing you to do it,
do you understand me?

01:42:28.778 --> 01:42:32.899
- Do you understand me Ramon?
- Not you too, Gen�, please

01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:45.865
- I'm sorry Ramon
- Goodbye Gen�

01:42:47.968 --> 01:42:50.903
Have a nice journey, partner.

01:43:33.083 --> 01:43:34.371
Good bye Manuela...

01:43:39.076 --> 01:43:40.642
and you Javi, please be good

01:43:41.371 --> 01:43:43.611
I understood what you meant with the poem

01:43:46.907 --> 01:43:48.005
Come here a moment

01:43:53.084 --> 01:43:54.211
Give me a hug

01:44:15.865 --> 01:44:18.007
Do me favor.
Take care of your grandpa

01:44:24.743 --> 01:44:26.182
Well Ramon, here we go.

01:44:44.494 --> 01:44:46.421
Can you close the door, kid?

01:44:59.915 --> 01:45:01.243
Come on, close it.

01:45:43.046 --> 01:45:44.863
What are you going to do in Boiro chief?

01:45:46.159 --> 01:45:49.678
I'm going to the beach.
For a change of view.

01:45:50.439 --> 01:45:53.253
A change of view? That's great

01:46:13.380 --> 01:46:16.130
This is the best I could find with the money you gave me.

01:46:16.532 --> 01:46:19.547
And I told them about the view.
Do you like it?

01:46:20.820 --> 01:46:25.243
- Where do I sign? -
What for? - To marry you.

01:46:30.682 --> 01:46:32.178
He fell asleep

01:46:33.346 --> 01:46:35.218
Of course.
Since I don't move at all.

01:46:49.836 --> 01:46:53.391
Ramon. If there's really life after death...

01:46:55.799 --> 01:46:58.750
I know this is going to sound foolish, but...

01:47:01.087 --> 01:47:03.943
- Please send me a sign?
- A sign?

01:47:04.176 --> 01:47:11.759
Anything. I never was scared of spirits.
I will be very alert. Waiting. Will you do it?

01:47:12.053 --> 01:47:13.750
Of course.

01:47:14.061 --> 01:47:28.148
But, between you and me, I think that after we die
there's nothing. Just like before we are born. Nothing

01:47:30.756 --> 01:47:32.740
How can you be so sure Ramon?

01:47:33.075 --> 01:47:34.308
No one knows that

01:47:34.532 --> 01:47:36.052
No I�m not sure.

01:47:36.260 --> 01:47:45.491
Is just a feeling. Is like when my father
looks at the sky and says "Tomorrow is going to rain" and it does

01:47:46.802 --> 01:47:48.858
Is a feeling.

01:47:52.251 --> 01:47:56.530
But there's something you shouldn't forget.
I'm going to be in your dreams

01:47:57.770 --> 01:48:03.307
I'm going to come at night to your bed
and we will make love

01:48:03.681 --> 01:48:06.568
And in case I don't tell you in your dreams
I tell you now

01:48:09.121 --> 01:48:15.129
Thanks Rosa, from the bottom of my heart.
Thanks

01:48:31.944 --> 01:48:38.601
Judges, political and religious authorities.
What does dignity mean to you?

01:48:39.656 --> 01:48:45.616
Whatever the answer of your conscience
know that for me, this is not a worthy life.

01:48:47.184 --> 01:48:51.351
I would have liked to at least die with dignity

01:48:51.695 --> 01:49:00.023
Today, tired of the institutional laziness,
I see myself forced to do it in hiding, like a criminal

01:49:00.215 --> 01:49:03.111
You should know that the processes conducting to my death

01:49:04.039 --> 01:49:09.398
has been carefully divided in small actions that do
not constitute a crime by themselves

01:49:09.709 --> 01:49:13.077
and have been executed by several friendly hands

01:49:13.278 --> 01:49:16.564
if even then, the state insists in punishing my helpers

01:49:16.693 --> 01:49:21.981
I would suggest that you cut their hands, because
that is all that they contributed

01:49:22.588 --> 01:49:26.548
The head, I mean the conscience was provided by me

01:49:27.628 --> 01:49:31.236
As you can see, to my side I have a
glass of water

01:49:31.923 --> 01:49:35.755
that contains a dose of potassium cyanide

01:49:37.179 --> 01:49:39.483
when I drink it I will cease to exist

01:49:40.250 --> 01:49:44.331
relinquishing my most precious property. My body

01:49:45.873 --> 01:49:51.354
I believe that living is a right
not an obligation, as has been in my case

01:49:52.089 --> 01:50:00.784
forced to accept this sad situation during 28 years,
4 months and some days

01:50:02.096 --> 01:50:08.320
After all this time I make a balance of the
road traveled and I can't account for the happiness

01:50:09.720 --> 01:50:15.528
Only the time that passed against my will,
during most of my life

01:50:16.863 --> 01:50:19.399
will be my ally from now on

01:50:20.263 --> 01:50:32.605
Only time and the evolution of consciences will decide
one day if my request was reasonable or not.

01:51:07.163 --> 01:51:08.667
Well...

01:51:18.504 --> 01:51:20.082
It's hot...

01:52:36.394 --> 01:52:40.812
- And Mark, is he coming?
- He is with our son on the beach. He loves the sea

01:52:41.732 --> 01:52:44.065
- They can't be thinking about getting in
- No! It's too cold

01:52:44.123 --> 01:52:46.032
- How are you?
- Fine

01:52:48.691 --> 01:52:51.864
- Is she going to understand me?
- Yes...

01:52:52.040 --> 01:52:58.416
- I mean, does she still follow conversations and such
- Yes, yes. Sometimes is a little difficult, but..

01:53:00.574 --> 01:53:04.845
- Well...I'll go see her, see you later
- See you later

01:53:20.805 --> 01:53:22.030
Hello Julia

01:53:24.005 --> 01:53:26.148
Hello. How are you?

01:53:27.244 --> 01:53:32.068
- Fine, and you?
- Well...here

01:53:38.187 --> 01:53:41.075
You have a very nice house. Very beautiful

01:53:46.858 --> 01:53:49.081
Well, you know that Ramon left me many letters.

01:53:49.306 --> 01:53:53.738
I think that he had fun leaving
writings around after he died

01:53:55.049 --> 01:53:57.009
The thing is that the other day

01:53:57.386 --> 01:53:59.425
I found this letter for you.

01:54:06.121 --> 01:54:07.793
Ramon who?

01:54:13.560 --> 01:54:16.895
Ramon Sampedro...
Your friend

01:54:19.024 --> 01:54:22.182
I introduced you two.
Do you remember?

01:54:25.167 --> 01:54:26.894
You?

01:54:27.991 --> 01:54:29.630
Yes

01:54:49.708 --> 01:54:51.717
It's very nice in here.

01:55:00.603 --> 01:55:02.970
Out to sea,
Out to sea

01:55:03.467 --> 01:55:05.123
And in the weightlessness of the bottom

01:55:05.283 --> 01:55:06.531
where dreams come true

01:55:06.948 --> 01:55:09.365
two wills come together to make a wish come true

01:55:10.068 --> 01:55:11.236
Your look and my look

01:55:11.877 --> 01:55:13.588
like an echo repeating, without words

01:55:14.116 --> 01:55:15.877
Deeper,
Deeper

01:55:16.332 --> 01:55:18.900
beyond everything through the blood and the bones

01:55:20.347 --> 01:55:21.483
But I always wake up

01:55:21.746 --> 01:55:23.459
and I always wish I�d be dead

01:55:24.108 --> 01:55:25.611
to stay with my mouth

01:55:25.996 --> 01:55:27.195
entangled in your hair

01:55:28.305 --> 01:55:34.896
