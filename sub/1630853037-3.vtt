Framily Dinner’s served!

01:12.606 --> 01:16.476
So I figured after dinner, we
could have, like, a game night.

01:16.577 --> 01:17.477
Like charades or something?

01:17.578 --> 01:18.878
Fun.

01:18.979 --> 01:20.179
These buns are so good.

01:20.247 --> 01:22.217
They’re actually
just a riff on a recipe

01:22.316 --> 01:23.646
that I found
in the kitchen drawer.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.990
They were called... Love Buns.

01:26.086 --> 01:27.746
♪ Put it on the line... ♪

01:27.854 --> 01:29.664
Are you kidding?
(chuckles)

01:30.624 --> 01:31.894
Mm-mm. Someone named Ruby, like,

01:31.992 --> 01:33.992
drew little hearts
all over the page,

01:34.094 --> 01:35.404
so I just figured

01:35.495 --> 01:36.895
they were, you know,
really made with love.

01:36.997 --> 01:38.227
Who’s Ruby, anyway?

01:38.332 --> 01:40.702
Oh, she’s my ex.

01:40.801 --> 01:42.001
Oh.

01:42.102 --> 01:43.372
Hmm, my bad.

01:43.470 --> 01:45.640
You guys still friends,
at least?

01:45.739 --> 01:47.039
Uh, we don’t
talk since,

01:47.140 --> 01:49.980
um... we don’t talk anymore.

01:50.077 --> 01:51.177
I bet she’s
one of those, um,

01:51.278 --> 01:53.348
"boil your bunny" types, right?

01:53.447 --> 01:55.217
I had this ex,
I actually found her

01:55.315 --> 01:57.245
collecting my hair.

01:57.351 --> 01:58.591
(laughs)
JORDAN:
Mmm-mmm.

01:58.685 --> 02:00.245
I’m going to excuse myself.

02:00.354 --> 02:01.394
I forgot that I have

02:01.488 --> 02:02.558
some papers to grade.

02:02.656 --> 02:04.216
Okay.
Mm-hmm.

02:05.626 --> 02:07.586
I really just stepped in it,
didn’t I?

02:07.694 --> 02:09.163
It’s fine, she’s fine.

02:09.262 --> 02:11.532
Just... needs some space.

02:11.632 --> 02:12.832
Mm.

02:12.933 --> 02:15.703
(laughs softly) Speaking
of space, you looked like

02:15.802 --> 02:18.672
a sexy stormtrooper
last night.

02:18.772 --> 02:19.712
Where were you going

02:19.806 --> 02:20.706
in that badass outfit?

02:20.807 --> 02:21.707
JORDAN:
Yeah, Mags.

02:21.808 --> 02:23.208
Where were you going?

02:23.310 --> 02:26.080
I, um, I couldn’t sleep, so I...

02:26.179 --> 02:27.379
Went demon hunting without me?

02:27.481 --> 02:28.751
Would you relax?

02:28.849 --> 02:29.949
I can handle myself.

02:30.050 --> 02:32.090
That’s not the point.
Then what is the point?

02:32.185 --> 02:34.745
You lied to me.
I didn’t lie. I just...

02:34.855 --> 02:37.125
You didn’t tell the whole truth.
All right, um...

02:37.224 --> 02:38.894
I suddenly lost
my appetite.

02:38.992 --> 02:40.632
Thank you for a lovely meal.

02:40.694 --> 02:42.404
Rain check on the charades.

02:42.496 --> 02:43.696
(exhales)

02:43.797 --> 02:46.367
My bad. Again.

02:46.466 --> 02:47.866
It’s okay.
(exhales)

02:47.968 --> 02:50.738
Oh, hey, I guess that
just means more jollof for us.

02:50.837 --> 02:52.707
(both chuckle)

02:54.441 --> 02:56.241
Is something wrong?

02:59.246 --> 03:00.246
It’s just the...

03:00.347 --> 03:01.447
That bowl.

03:01.548 --> 03:03.118
It was, um...

03:04.117 --> 03:05.387
Sorry, I’m just...

03:10.123 --> 03:12.063
(scoffs)

03:12.159 --> 03:13.889
"Welcome to the family, Kaela."

03:13.994 --> 03:16.404
"Thanks for dinner."

03:23.537 --> 03:26.807
CHILD:
♪ Tallyman, Tallyman,
he keeps count ♪

03:26.907 --> 03:28.677
(panting)

03:28.775 --> 03:30.435

(gasps)

04:10.150 --> 04:11.950
Ruby?

04:13.453 --> 04:17.293
Miss me, Love Buns?

04:18.791 --> 04:20.262
(exhales)

04:28.435 --> 04:29.875
(footsteps approaching)

04:29.970 --> 04:31.800
Oh. You look like hell.

04:32.806 --> 04:35.206
Didn’t sleep. Terrible dreams.

04:35.308 --> 04:36.908
About the Tallyman?

04:37.010 --> 04:38.950
Yeah.

04:39.045 --> 04:40.775
And maybe about Ruby?

04:40.881 --> 04:43.181
No.

04:43.283 --> 04:44.683
I don’t want to talk about it.

04:44.785 --> 04:47.995
Okay, that’s, you know,

04:48.088 --> 04:49.918
it’s totally understandable,

04:50.023 --> 04:52.593
what with the whole
Framily Dinner thing.

04:52.692 --> 04:54.262
Any chance you’re ready

04:54.361 --> 04:56.731
to tell me what exactly
happened between you two?

04:56.830 --> 04:58.560
Can we just focus on work?

04:58.665 --> 05:00.365
Roger that.

05:01.468 --> 05:02.768
These are the
weird events

05:02.869 --> 05:04.139
that have been happening
in the past...

05:04.237 --> 05:05.867
six months.

05:05.972 --> 05:08.942
An elf was kidnapped
and buried alive.

05:09.042 --> 05:11.542
A satyr woke up
to his vineyards burning.

05:11.645 --> 05:14.285
Razor blades in the school
lunches of goblins.

05:14.381 --> 05:16.921
That’s horrible.
The Tallyman did all this?

05:17.017 --> 05:18.117
I think so.

05:18.218 --> 05:19.288
But the question is why.

05:19.386 --> 05:21.886
There’s no pattern, no motive.

05:21.988 --> 05:22.958
Maybe that’s the point.

05:23.023 --> 05:24.563
Random acts of terror

05:24.658 --> 05:26.188
are way more damaging
to the psyche.

05:26.293 --> 05:27.763
It creates this
constant feeling of fear

05:27.861 --> 05:29.361
and lack of control.

05:29.462 --> 05:31.102
It’s scary.

05:31.198 --> 05:32.768
Which is why I’ve decided
I need to figure out

05:32.866 --> 05:34.826
a way to get my
time powers back.

05:34.935 --> 05:36.775
Because this guy
will strike again,

05:36.870 --> 05:38.740
and when he does,
we are going to need

05:38.839 --> 05:40.769
more weapons at our disposal.

05:40.874 --> 05:42.884
I am going to go get changed.

05:44.344 --> 05:46.514
(sighs)

05:49.216 --> 05:50.276
MAGGIE:
Hi.

05:50.383 --> 05:52.823
Coffee?

05:52.919 --> 05:55.249
Thanks.

05:55.355 --> 05:57.085
(sighs)

06:01.595 --> 06:03.605
Are you still mad
about last night?

06:03.697 --> 06:06.497
Because I really want
things to be okay.

06:06.600 --> 06:09.140
No, you want things
to feel okay.

06:09.236 --> 06:11.696
What is that
supposed to mean?

06:11.805 --> 06:13.615
I talk, you pretend to listen

06:13.707 --> 06:15.207
so you feel like
you’ve heard me,

06:15.308 --> 06:17.638
but you don’t actually
change your behavior.

06:17.711 --> 06:19.811
And I’m not even a psych major.

06:19.913 --> 06:21.313
Hmm.
(sighs)

06:21.414 --> 06:23.284
(phone buzzes)

06:25.619 --> 06:27.749
It’s Frank the Leprechaun.

06:27.854 --> 06:29.364
Nice of him to
finally text you back

06:29.456 --> 06:32.126
after almost getting you
blown up in that safe house.

06:32.225 --> 06:34.055
There’s something
he wants us to see.

06:34.160 --> 06:35.900
Says it’s urgent.

06:35.996 --> 06:39.366
In the beginning,
magic was everywhere,

06:39.466 --> 06:41.496
until one being known
as the Conqueror

06:41.601 --> 06:43.671
sought to steal it for himself.

06:43.770 --> 06:46.210
And he would have, if
not for three sisters

06:46.306 --> 06:48.166
brave enough to
stand against him,

06:48.275 --> 06:52.615
the first Charmed Ones:
Ishta, Inara, Ishani.

06:52.712 --> 06:54.812
From that day forth,
any time a grave threat

06:54.915 --> 06:56.455
to the magical world forms,

06:56.549 --> 06:58.819
the Charmed Ones
rise to meet it.

07:01.821 --> 07:04.191
...and make everyone
a ham sandwich.

07:04.291 --> 07:06.631
Kaela. You must
pay attention.

07:06.726 --> 07:07.856
I am.

07:07.961 --> 07:09.661
Look,
no disrespect, dude,

07:09.763 --> 07:11.203
but when you said that we
were gonna do "witch training,"

07:11.264 --> 07:13.904
I kind of thought you meant
we’d do some real magic.

07:14.000 --> 07:15.770
Of course we’re gonna do magic,
in a little over four months.

07:15.869 --> 07:19.239
Four months? Uh, but I already
helped save Josefina.

07:19.339 --> 07:22.009
You got lucky.
And skill and improvisation

07:22.108 --> 07:23.578
are two very different things.
No, no, they’re not.

07:23.677 --> 07:25.037
Not to me. Do you think

07:25.145 --> 07:26.915
I learned to fix an engine
from a book?

07:27.013 --> 07:29.353
No. I took it apart
and put it back together.

07:29.449 --> 07:30.579
And, yeah, I made mistakes,
but that’s what...

07:30.684 --> 07:32.154
You are a manifestor,

07:32.252 --> 07:34.092
which means you have
a particularly powerful form

07:34.187 --> 07:36.117
of magic at your disposal.

07:36.222 --> 07:37.562
You can’t make mistakes.

07:37.657 --> 07:39.457
(sighs)

07:39.559 --> 07:41.229
Why don’t we take a break?

07:41.328 --> 07:42.928
Yeah. Yeah, let’s do that.

07:45.565 --> 07:48.725
Thanks for your no-show at
my Framily Dinner, by the way.

07:48.835 --> 07:51.995
Yes, I’m, uh, sorry, I
prefer to take my meals

07:52.105 --> 07:53.415
in the Tree Room.

07:53.506 --> 07:55.206
See, I don’t know
what that means.

07:55.308 --> 07:57.508
And I would ask,
but I learned last night

07:57.610 --> 07:59.150
that that’s not cool
with this crew.

08:01.114 --> 08:02.754
Well, what happened last night?

08:02.849 --> 08:05.179
Mel’s love life,
Maggie’s outfit.

08:05.285 --> 08:06.895
Everyone freaked out and left.

08:06.987 --> 08:08.487
(laughs softly)

08:08.588 --> 08:10.888
I don’t know how I’m supposed
to bond with anyone

08:10.991 --> 08:13.061
when no one will
talk about anything.

08:13.159 --> 08:14.729
You’re meeting the members
of this family

08:14.828 --> 08:16.898
at a very delicate time.

08:16.997 --> 08:19.297
Yeah, even a bowl
can set them off.

08:19.399 --> 08:21.729
What?
I used this blue bowl

08:21.835 --> 08:24.645
and Maggie practically
started crying.

08:24.738 --> 08:27.668
Cornflower blue,
with yellow stars?

08:28.908 --> 08:30.638
Macy and I bought it
at a little flea market

08:30.744 --> 08:32.414
just outside San Francisco.

08:32.511 --> 08:34.452
So what, we’re just supposed
to encase it in amber

08:34.547 --> 08:35.917
a-and never touch it again?

08:36.015 --> 08:37.476
I mean, come on, dude.

08:37.583 --> 08:38.854
W-Where are you going?

08:38.952 --> 08:40.152
Break’s over.

08:40.253 --> 08:43.063
You were right.
Time to get our hands dirty.

08:47.894 --> 08:49.664
Come on, baby.

08:51.998 --> 08:57.735
Stop!

08:57.837 --> 08:59.767
Stop!
Stop! Stop!

09:02.575 --> 09:05.475
Damn it, why won’t you stop?

09:05.578 --> 09:07.078
(glass shatters)

09:28.134 --> 09:29.704
What’s the bubbly for?

09:29.803 --> 09:31.143
MEL:
Oh, nothing.

09:31.237 --> 09:33.167
(chuckles)
Yeah, I’m not buying it.

09:33.273 --> 09:35.643
Between those boots,
that dress

09:35.742 --> 09:39.512
and the $300 bottle of bubbly,

09:39.612 --> 09:41.482
something’s clearly up.

09:41.581 --> 09:43.181
Put your book down
for a sec.

09:43.283 --> 09:45.323
But I’m just getting
to the part where...

09:45.418 --> 09:46.918
Please?

09:51.958 --> 09:54.728
Okay. In the nine months
we’ve been dating,

09:54.828 --> 09:57.528
this is by far the most nervous
that you’ve ever made me.

09:57.630 --> 10:00.800
There’s no reason for
you to be nervous.

10:06.005 --> 10:08.305
What the hell was that?

10:08.408 --> 10:11.338
JORDAN:
Leprechaun lives there
at the end of the block.

10:14.447 --> 10:17.517
(sighs)
What?

10:17.617 --> 10:19.447
This guy’s our only lead
to the Tallyman.

10:19.552 --> 10:22.222
We need as much info
as we can get out of him.

10:22.322 --> 10:23.392
You’d be surprised
how much info

10:23.490 --> 10:25.360
this can get out of people.

10:25.458 --> 10:26.788
You’re missing the point.

10:26.893 --> 10:28.693
You know, if you have
something to say, out with it.

10:28.795 --> 10:30.865
This passive-aggressiveness
is unhealthy.

10:30.964 --> 10:33.034
(scoffs)
You want to talk unhealthy,

10:33.133 --> 10:34.603
your whole ass-kicking
coping mechanism

10:34.701 --> 10:37.401
is at the top of that
DSM-V chart.

10:37.504 --> 10:39.374
I thought you
liked fighting.

10:39.472 --> 10:40.972
You said it felt good.

10:41.074 --> 10:44.384
It did. All that anger
is empowering, but...

10:44.477 --> 10:48.677
Maggie, sometimes...
you gotta let it feel bad.

10:48.781 --> 10:50.881
I went to therapy for months
after Macy died.

10:50.984 --> 10:52.224
I felt my feels.

10:52.318 --> 10:54.748
LEPRECHAUN (crying out):
Help!

10:54.854 --> 10:57.024
Did you hear that?
Yeah.

10:57.123 --> 11:00.933
Help! Help!

11:01.027 --> 11:03.897
Help, help, help!
Get me out of here.

11:03.997 --> 11:06.927
Help. Help me!

11:07.033 --> 11:08.373
Get me out of here.

to you, too.

27:01.920 --> 27:03.150
Please, have a seat.

27:04.590 --> 27:06.560
Suit yourself.

27:07.793 --> 27:09.533
Thought we could get to know
each other a little bit.

27:09.628 --> 27:11.928
Why?
I like to know
all of my patrons.

27:12.030 --> 27:13.500
Especially the ones
who come in

27:13.599 --> 27:16.599

cursed coins and leprechauns.

27:16.702 --> 27:20.172
Who knows? Maybe we can
even become friends.

Oh, you send goons
after your friends?

27:21.740 --> 27:23.340
I send the nice ones.

27:25.010 --> 27:26.680
You and I are the same,
you know.

27:26.778 --> 27:29.008
I doubt that very much.
We’re nothing alike.

27:29.114 --> 27:30.884
So you’re not destined
to wander this earthly plane

27:30.983 --> 27:32.323
year after year,

27:32.417 --> 27:34.387
never aging,
never changing,

27:34.486 --> 27:37.386
while the world you know
and the people you love

27:37.489 --> 27:38.989
just keep passing you by?

27:39.091 --> 27:40.931
What are you?

27:41.026 --> 27:42.526
I’m a Circadian.

27:42.628 --> 27:45.028
Means I get a year up here,

27:45.130 --> 27:47.100
then it’s back underground
for seven long ones.

27:47.199 --> 27:50.699
I’m on the back half of
this round of Rumspringa.

27:50.802 --> 27:53.202
I thought Circadians were
all gone.
They are.

27:53.305 --> 27:54.875
Just like Whitelighters.

27:57.075 --> 27:59.635
Being the last one
can be lonely, can’t it?

28:00.979 --> 28:02.179

28:02.281 --> 28:03.481
How’s the training going?

28:04.583 --> 28:06.353
You are a Whitelighter,

28:06.451 --> 28:08.151
and there is a new
Charmed One in our midst.

28:08.253 --> 28:10.493
Mm.
And let’s just say

28:10.589 --> 28:12.019
the circumstances
under which she arrived

28:12.124 --> 28:15.464
were... curious.

28:15.561 --> 28:19.231
So, come on, spill some tea.

28:19.331 --> 28:22.731
Well, to be honest, she’s
proving to be quite difficult.

28:22.834 --> 28:24.044
Oh, yeah?

28:25.204 --> 28:26.444
Think I can help you with that.

Sunny, got a minute?

28:35.080 --> 28:36.150

Any luck?

28:36.248 --> 28:39.218
No. What are you
doing over there?

28:39.318 --> 28:41.388
Mixing a potion to
help me sober up.

28:41.486 --> 28:43.386
I think I got it.
Listen to this.

28:43.488 --> 28:45.288

"and shedding their skin

28:52.364 --> 28:54.634
Does that say they
swallow their prey whole?

28:54.700 --> 28:55.900
Ah, but it says
they regurgitate it

28:56.001 --> 28:57.201
and spin it into a sac.

28:57.302 --> 28:59.572
That’s why Kaela’s light
is blinking.

liquefy the skin,

convince me not to be nervous,

you’re failing.

need to be nervous.

29:45.550 --> 29:46.890

29:49.721 --> 29:52.191
I need you to
close your eyes.

29:52.291 --> 29:54.331
For a second.

29:57.429 --> 29:58.959
No.

going through that again.

Having a 5G phone that‘s
not on T-Mobile

that drink does

34:25.096 --> 34:27.295
Because, unlike the Elders,

34:27.399 --> 34:29.299
I want to give you a choice,

34:29.400 --> 34:30.940
That’s why I brought

Earlier, when I wanted
to talk to you,

Okay?

34:53.958 --> 34:56.228

34:56.328 --> 34:59.028
and she looked me in the eyes
and smiled

34:59.130 --> 35:01.030

35:02.067 --> 35:03.997
Five months ago.

35:04.102 --> 35:07.612
It was a total disaster.

35:07.706 --> 35:09.966
Mel, why didn’t you tell me?

35:10.075 --> 35:11.945
Because it was embarrassing.

35:12.043 --> 35:13.953

And you and I

It was wonderful.

I got you. I got you.

40:49.080 --> 40:50.380
(whispers):
I got you.

40:50.481 --> 40:52.051
Where am I?

40:52.150 --> 40:53.850
We’re on one
of the San Juan Islands.

40:53.952 --> 40:55.752
I remember going into the house

40:55.853 --> 40:57.923
a-and grabbing that egg.

40:58.022 --> 41:00.662
Whoa. Hold up, what egg?

41:00.758 --> 41:02.028
On the table,

41:02.126 --> 41:04.126
there was a stone...
It was an egg.

41:05.763 --> 41:07.733
How on earth do you know
it was an egg?

41:07.832 --> 41:09.232
Because of Harry’s lectures

41:09.334 --> 41:13.174
about the reproductive cycles
of magical creatures.

41:13.271 --> 41:16.071
It’s like Tim Burton’s version
of the birds and the bees.

41:16.174 --> 41:18.484
Were you
still holding on to the egg

41:18.576 --> 41:20.136
when the lamia attacked?

41:22.113 --> 41:25.083
Okay. Okay, come on.

41:25.183 --> 41:26.323
Where are we going?

41:26.417 --> 41:28.487
To stop Maggie
from killing an innocent mother.

41:28.586 --> 41:30.716
Okay. Come on.
(lamia roaring)

41:38.629 --> 41:40.699
Don’t even think about it.

41:41.466 --> 41:43.066
JORDAN:
Wait, Maggie, don’t!

41:43.167 --> 41:44.767
We had it all wrong.

41:44.869 --> 41:46.039
MAGGIE:
She tried to kill Kaela.

41:46.137 --> 41:47.367
That’s enough for me.

41:47.472 --> 41:48.742
Because I was holding her egg.
JORDAN:
The stone

41:48.840 --> 41:50.710
we found
at the leprechaun’s house.

41:51.843 --> 41:52.813
She’s not a vicious killer.

41:52.910 --> 41:55.080
She’s just a mama

41:55.179 --> 41:57.209
protecting her baby.

41:59.183 --> 42:00.623
Is that true?

42:12.196 --> 42:14.896
That means the Tallyman
planted the egg

42:14.999 --> 42:16.629
with the leprechaun

42:16.734 --> 42:18.474
and then blew him up
knowing we would take it.

42:18.569 --> 42:21.109
So she would
come attack us.

42:21.205 --> 42:22.465
Why?

42:22.573 --> 42:23.973
Why would someone

42:24.075 --> 42:25.945
pit us against each other
like that?

42:26.044 --> 42:28.354
(rapid ticking)

42:30.181 --> 42:32.951
Does anyone hear... ticking?

42:33.951 --> 42:35.421
Jordan.

42:36.387 --> 42:38.517
It’s the leprechaun
all over again.

42:38.623 --> 42:40.193
LAMIA:
The leprechaun

42:40.291 --> 42:41.191
that you just said blew up?

42:41.292 --> 42:42.932
Hurry, get it off of you.

42:43.027 --> 42:45.657
I don’t feel anything.
MAGGIE:
He sneaks it in you.

42:45.763 --> 42:47.873
Like how the leprechaun
drank the whiskey.

42:47.965 --> 42:49.825
So it could’ve been
in any drink?

42:53.204 --> 42:56.244
I’m not gonna survive this,
am I?

43:13.091 --> 43:14.961
Then here.

43:16.294 --> 43:20.134
My nest is about five miles due
north, next to the waterfall.

43:20.231 --> 43:21.971
The egg has to be in it
when it hatches,

43:22.066 --> 43:23.366
or it won’t survive.

43:23.468 --> 43:25.238
Go. We don’t know

43:25.303 --> 43:26.843
how much time we have left.

43:26.938 --> 43:29.108
No, no. No, we have
to do something.

Mel, no,
we have to do something.

47:56.474 --> 47:58.814
Uh, I was gonna say it’s...

I’m an only child. (chuckles)

I’m-I’m adopted?

Um, no, my-my parents adopted me
when I was a baby,

48:37.948 --> 48:40.448
and they’re all I’ve ever known.

48:40.551 --> 48:42.821
Well, your biological parents
would be an excellent source

48:42.920 --> 48:45.290
of knowledge about your powers.
Could fast-track everything.

48:45.389 --> 48:47.589
No. I’m not going there.

48:47.691 --> 48:49.361
I’ve always said

48:49.460 --> 48:52.830

to know exactly who I am.

48:52.930 --> 48:55.330

48:55.433 --> 48:57.333

49:08.913 --> 49:10.013
Everything’s fine.

49:10.114 --> 49:12.184
I was just hoping we could talk?

49:13.184 --> 49:15.494
Uh, yeah.

49:15.586 --> 49:17.446
Can I come in?

49:23.794 --> 49:26.564
I’m the social media director
for the Falcons

49:26.664 --> 49:31.134
and volunteering at a shelter
for homeless LGBTQ+ kids.

49:33.137 --> 49:36.437
But something tells me we are
not here to talk about my life.

49:36.540 --> 49:39.740
No, I want to hear about you.

49:39.844 --> 49:42.354
But you’re right.

49:42.446 --> 49:44.946
I was hoping we could talk
about the... you know.

49:45.916 --> 49:47.216
The proposal?

49:47.318 --> 49:49.318
The one

49:49.420 --> 49:52.420
where you got down on one knee,
like, ten minutes

49:52.523 --> 49:54.193
after your sister died

49:54.291 --> 49:56.261
and you had just

49:56.360 --> 49:58.030
given up your future baby?

49:58.128 --> 50:01.498
I admit, the timing was bad.

50:01.599 --> 50:02.699
(chuckles):
Yeah.

50:02.800 --> 50:04.430
Yes.

50:04.535 --> 50:08.475
But I would’ve turned you down
regardless of the timing.

50:10.441 --> 50:12.181
Why?

50:13.210 --> 50:16.680
Being with you was wonderful.

50:18.549 --> 50:21.119
It was also difficult.

50:21.218 --> 50:23.588
And lonely.

50:26.156 --> 50:27.416
Maybe this was a bad idea.

50:27.525 --> 50:29.735
No, no, I...

50:29.827 --> 50:31.697
I need to know.

50:31.795 --> 50:34.455
I want to know.

50:38.702 --> 50:40.142
Well...

50:42.106 --> 50:44.976
The relationship was...

50:45.075 --> 50:47.035
all about you

50:47.144 --> 50:49.684
and saving the world.

50:50.681 --> 50:53.121
And if I am being
really honest...

50:55.052 --> 50:58.122
I don’t know how well
you really know me.

51:03.761 --> 51:05.061

51:05.162 --> 51:07.002

51:10.501 --> 51:13.771

51:15.773 --> 51:18.613
You know, we got off
to a rocky start,

51:18.709 --> 51:21.709
but I think we’re gonna
make a great team.

51:21.812 --> 51:23.352

together, dude.

51:23.447 --> 51:24.847

51:24.949 --> 51:26.849
You’re gonna kick ass,
I have no doubt,

51:26.951 --> 51:28.951
but unfortunately,
it’s not gonna be with me.

51:29.053 --> 51:31.023
What?
What are you talking about?

51:31.121 --> 51:32.891
All that friction
with your training

51:32.957 --> 51:35.057
actually has nothing to do
with you.

51:35.159 --> 51:38.659
No, being a Whitelighter
just doesn’t feel right anymore.

51:38.762 --> 51:41.362
Huh. Okay, so...

51:41.465 --> 51:44.025
who’s gonna train me?

51:44.134 --> 51:48.144
Well, the universe has a way
of sending the right person.

51:48.238 --> 51:50.938
Right. Right.

51:51.041 --> 51:53.441
Uh, on that note,
I’m gonna go pee.

51:57.881 --> 51:59.981
And I’m gonna go live a little.

52:06.624 --> 52:09.064
(chuckles)

52:09.159 --> 52:11.629
(Kaela chuckles)

52:12.930 --> 52:14.000
What are you looking at?

52:14.999 --> 52:16.799
Not much.

52:30.614 --> 52:32.084
To new beginnings.

52:33.517 --> 52:35.587
I can trust you, right?

52:35.686 --> 52:37.586
Most people would say no.

52:37.688 --> 52:39.888
But we’re already part
of our own club.

52:42.526 --> 52:44.526
And what club is that?

52:45.529 --> 52:47.899
The one where we fall in love
with someone

52:47.998 --> 52:51.768
and then have to spend eternity
without them.

53:08.519 --> 53:10.089
(echoes):
How do you feel?

53:10.187 --> 53:12.257
(whistling, whirring)

53:30.441 --> 53:33.081
"A house without hinges,
lock or key,

53:33.177 --> 53:36.247
yet golden treasure
lies inside me."

53:36.346 --> 53:38.416
Hey.
"Life, death..." Hey.

53:38.515 --> 53:40.415
"...and everything in between."

53:40.517 --> 53:43.347
Okay, we know
that’s referring to the egg.

53:43.454 --> 53:46.324
"Foe is friend,
friend is foe,

53:46.423 --> 53:48.263
but it won’t matter
when it’s time to go."

53:48.358 --> 53:51.158
That’s the lamia.

53:51.261 --> 53:53.731
It’s this line
I still don’t get.

53:55.733 --> 53:59.073
"All will be clear
when some is seen."

53:59.169 --> 54:01.139
Well, I don’t know.

54:01.238 --> 54:03.238
Let’s not worry
about that tonight.

54:03.340 --> 54:05.740
We already got the egg in
the nest. Let’s celebrate

54:05.843 --> 54:07.083
by taking
this bottle of wine upstairs

54:07.177 --> 54:08.477
and crawling into bed.
Mm.

54:08.579 --> 54:11.079
You sure you wouldn’t rather
go vanquish some demons?

54:11.181 --> 54:13.321
(chuckles)
I thought we were over that.

54:13.417 --> 54:15.117
Yeah, I did, too,

54:15.185 --> 54:16.785
until I saw you with the lamia.

54:16.887 --> 54:19.487
Maggie, you would’ve killed her
if Kaela hadn’t have

54:19.590 --> 54:21.590
stopped you.
Yeah, well, she did,

54:21.692 --> 54:22.792
so I didn’t.

54:22.893 --> 54:24.033
You’re missing the point.

54:24.128 --> 54:26.028
The Maggie
I fell in love with

54:26.130 --> 54:27.700
was empathetic first.

54:27.798 --> 54:30.328
So, what is it
that you’re saying?
(scoffs)

54:30.434 --> 54:32.374
I’m saying that...

54:32.469 --> 54:34.899
I can’t keep enabling you.

54:35.005 --> 54:36.865
I won’t be a part

54:36.974 --> 54:38.144
of your fighting anymore.
Jordan,

54:38.242 --> 54:39.712
I’m a Charmed One.
It’s my job to fight.

54:39.810 --> 54:41.650
This isn’t about that,
and you know it.

54:42.679 --> 54:45.579
You say you want to save
the world from bad.

54:45.682 --> 54:48.152
Maggie, what if that’s
what you’re starting to become?

54:48.252 --> 54:49.992
That’s a little harsh,
don’t you think?

54:50.087 --> 54:51.987
I think I want to help people.

54:53.590 --> 54:54.690
Heal people.

54:54.792 --> 54:56.892
(exhales)
You know, if you want

54:56.994 --> 54:59.504
the same thing,
then we can work through this.

54:59.596 --> 55:02.326
(scoffs)

55:02.432 --> 55:04.672
But first,
you got to figure out

55:04.768 --> 55:05.938
what it is you want.

55:13.243 --> 55:15.153
("Send Me Away" by Zach Person
playing)

55:15.245 --> 55:16.805
(indistinct chatter)

55:21.652 --> 55:23.692
(chatter, laughter)

55:26.623 --> 55:29.133
Hi, Dr. Choy. It’s Maggie Vera.

55:29.226 --> 55:31.426
Um, I know it’s
pretty late,

55:31.528 --> 55:33.098
but I could
use a session.

55:33.197 --> 55:35.027
Hey, beautiful.

55:35.132 --> 55:36.872
Hey, you need
someone to talk to?
(chuckles)

55:36.967 --> 55:38.637
Come on over here,
talk to me.

55:38.735 --> 55:40.635
It’s kind of an
emergency, actually.

55:40.737 --> 55:42.867
Uh...
Where’s your man at?

55:42.973 --> 55:44.743
You got a man?

55:44.842 --> 55:47.812
I’ll be your man.
Please, just... can
you call me back?

55:47.911 --> 55:49.951
Oh!

55:50.047 --> 55:53.247
(whoops) Yeah, back is
even better than the front.

55:53.350 --> 55:54.820
What’s your problem?

55:54.918 --> 55:57.148
Can’t you see I was trying
to leave a voice mail?

55:57.254 --> 55:58.624
Oh, my bad, sweetheart.
I was just being nice.

55:58.722 --> 56:00.022
Oh, nice?

56:00.123 --> 56:01.863
You think it’s nice
to harass women like that?

56:01.959 --> 56:03.859
Hey, I was
giving you compliments.

56:03.961 --> 56:06.061
You don’t need to be
such a bitch.

56:08.165 --> 56:10.735
