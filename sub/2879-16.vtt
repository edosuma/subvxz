WEBVTT

00:02.293 --> 00:03.556
You'll never believe
what happened to me

00:03.557 --> 00:04.479
at work today.
Hmm?

00:04.480 --> 00:07.481
This old guy was choking on
his food, and I saved his life.

00:07.483 --> 00:08.932
You're kidding.
Did you Heimlich him?

00:08.934 --> 00:11.368
No. I said, "Oh, my God,
I think that old guy's choking,"

00:11.370 --> 00:13.370
and then one of the busboys
Heimlich'ed him.

00:15.874 --> 00:17.441
You're a hero.

00:17.443 --> 00:21.295
Yeah, that <i>was</i>
the point of the story.

00:21.297 --> 00:22.997
Oh, yeah, speaking of work,
do you know

00:22.999 --> 00:24.398
if you have
Thursday night off?

00:24.400 --> 00:25.949
Um, I think so. Why?

00:25.951 --> 00:27.951
What do you mean, why?
It's Valentine's Day.

00:27.953 --> 00:29.220
Oh, right.

00:29.222 --> 00:30.504
Yeah, we can do something.

00:30.506 --> 00:33.173
You could be
a little more into it.

00:33.175 --> 00:34.975
No, I'm into it, I'm into it.

00:34.977 --> 00:36.560
Just, there's so much pressure
to make the night special,

00:36.562 --> 00:38.262
and it never works out.

00:38.264 --> 00:40.464
Okay, well, this time
it's going to be different.

00:40.466 --> 00:42.616
Because I am
like a romance ninja.

00:44.469 --> 00:46.237
You don't see it coming,
and then bam!

00:46.239 --> 00:49.440
Romance, watch out, hearts,
kisses, love, ooh-ya!

00:50.408 --> 00:51.975
You know,
sometimes I think I've made you

00:51.977 --> 00:53.644
so much cooler
than you used to be,

00:53.646 --> 00:55.246
and then you go and do that.

00:57.649 --> 00:58.999
So, in conclusion,

00:59.001 --> 01:01.752
I believe the painful
sensation felt

01:01.754 --> 01:04.154
after passing a meal
of spicy chilies

01:04.156 --> 01:08.325
is proof that the rectum does
possess the sense of taste.

01:13.882 --> 01:15.883
I concur, but you
changed the subject.

01:15.885 --> 01:19.053
What are we doing
for Valentine's Day?

01:19.055 --> 01:21.438

Okay.

Okay!

02:07.341 --> 02:08.491
Okay.

02:11.638 --> 02:12.970
Everything okay?

02:16.692 --> 02:18.393
Bernie's a little cranky

02:18.395 --> 02:20.511
since she's been working,
like, 17 hours a day.

02:20.513 --> 02:23.030
And I've got a lot on my plate,
too, because I've been

02:23.032 --> 02:25.116
busting my tail
playing <i>Assassin's Creed.</i>

02:25.118 --> 02:26.734
Hey, Stuart,

02:26.736 --> 02:28.403
you got anything going on
for Valentine's Day?

02:28.405 --> 02:29.687
Not really.

02:29.689 --> 02:32.189
Other than hiding all
the sharp objects around here

02:32.191 --> 02:34.876
and white-knuckling it
till morning.

02:34.878 --> 02:36.043
What do you got going on?

02:36.045 --> 02:38.362
Oh, well, I was going
to spend the night

02:38.364 --> 02:40.164
with my special little lady,
but, uh,

02:40.166 --> 02:43.868
she got worms, and then I
had to take her to the vet.

02:47.139 --> 02:48.589
There must be something
we can do.

02:48.591 --> 02:51.592
Well, uh, how about you keep
the store open late,

02:51.594 --> 02:53.594
and we throw a party
for all the people

02:53.596 --> 02:54.595
who don't have dates?

02:54.597 --> 02:57.014
That actually sounds
kind of nice.

02:57.016 --> 02:58.900
Yeah, the theme will be
that the greatest love

02:58.902 --> 03:03.104
a man can have
is the love he has with himself.

03:04.623 --> 03:06.190
That's good.

03:06.192 --> 03:10.995
Or maybe something a little less
"hand in the pants."

03:13.198 --> 03:14.532
Oh, Alex, excellent.

03:14.534 --> 03:16.918
I have a research problem

03:16.920 --> 03:18.786
that I believe
you can help with.

03:18.788 --> 03:20.505
Oh, Dr. Cooper, thank you.

03:20.507 --> 03:22.290
I've been waiting
for an opportunity

03:22.292 --> 03:24.175
to contribute
to your scientific work.

03:24.177 --> 03:27.678
Oh, no, no.
That's not going to happen, no.

03:28.881 --> 03:32.967
What I need you to do
is find a Valentine's gift

03:32.969 --> 03:35.353
for my girlfriend.

03:35.355 --> 03:37.355
You realize I passed up
an opportunity

03:37.357 --> 03:40.274
to work at Fermilab
to take this job with you.

03:40.276 --> 03:43.978
Well, I guess those chaps
will have to have

03:43.980 --> 03:46.230
someone else buy
their girlfriends presents.

03:46.232 --> 03:47.448
Now, here is...

03:47.450 --> 03:50.151
Let's see.

03:50.153 --> 03:51.652
This is...

03:55.224 --> 03:57.358
This is about $2,000.

03:57.360 --> 03:58.960
Um, I think

03:58.962 --> 04:02.880
she likes monkeys
and the color gray.

04:09.004 --> 04:11.339
Contribute to my work.

04:13.091 --> 04:17.461
Ah, kids say
the darnedest things.

04:19.565 --> 04:20.848
Hey, you coming
to lunch?

04:20.850 --> 04:21.933
Yeah, one second.

04:21.935 --> 04:23.267
Come here. I want
to show you something.

04:23.269 --> 04:24.301
What you looking at?

04:24.303 --> 04:26.354
Well, I was trying
to come up with something

04:26.356 --> 04:28.639
really romantic
to give Bernadette

04:28.641 --> 04:29.991
for Valentine's Day
since she's been

04:29.993 --> 04:32.493
such a pain in the ass.

04:35.146 --> 04:37.698
You can't find a
card that says that?

04:37.700 --> 04:39.166
Check it out.

04:39.168 --> 04:40.835
I used the
atomic force microscope

04:40.837 --> 04:44.422
in the material science lab
and wrote our initials

04:44.424 --> 04:47.542
in a heart 1/1,000
the size of a grain of sand.

04:48.510 --> 04:50.678
Oh, that's cool.

04:50.680 --> 04:55.349
A micro-valentine
for a microbiologist.

04:55.351 --> 04:58.102
From her micro-husband.

05:01.673 --> 05:02.690
That is amazing.

05:02.692 --> 05:04.559
How long did this take you?

05:04.561 --> 05:06.811
Mmm, about 12 hours.

05:06.813 --> 05:08.279
I pulled an all-nighter.

05:08.281 --> 05:09.346
Oh, wow.

05:09.348 --> 05:11.198
Yeah, I know,
it really took a bite

05:11.200 --> 05:13.484
out of my video game time.

05:13.486 --> 05:15.319
What are you
and Penny doing?

05:15.321 --> 05:17.655
Oh, I'm going to take her to
a nice restaurant for dinner.

05:17.657 --> 05:21.025
Oh, that's not bad,
but as far as romance goes,

05:21.027 --> 05:23.544
I think my gift hits it
right out of...

05:27.382 --> 05:29.216
Want to come to
dinner with us?

05:29.218 --> 05:30.885
Yes, please.

05:32.971 --> 05:34.371
Okay.

05:34.373 --> 05:36.257
Amy will be
here shortly,

05:36.259 --> 05:39.677
expecting the perfect
Valentine's gift, so...

05:39.679 --> 05:41.012
you're up kid.

05:41.014 --> 05:43.097
Dazzle me. Go.

05:43.099 --> 05:45.683
Okay, I think I have
some really great choices.

05:45.685 --> 05:47.652
I went on Amy's
Facebook page

05:47.654 --> 05:49.353
and read up on her interests.

05:49.355 --> 05:52.023
Now, see, I never would have
thought to do that.

05:53.058 --> 05:54.492
Clearly, I made a good choice

05:54.494 --> 05:55.726
farming this out to you.

05:55.728 --> 05:58.412
But I am telling you,
Amy hit the boyfriend jackpot.

05:58.414 --> 06:01.198
Anyway, my socks are on.

06:01.200 --> 06:02.750
Let's knock them off.

06:07.589 --> 06:09.874
Well, um, I know she loves
playing the harp,

06:09.876 --> 06:14.929
so I found this
beautiful music box

06:14.931 --> 06:16.847
that plays one
of her favorite songs.

06:19.551 --> 06:21.953
Now, Amy already
has a real harp.

06:23.021 --> 06:25.756
And it can play any song.

06:25.758 --> 06:28.359
What are you trying
to pull here?

06:29.127 --> 06:30.645
No, I just thought
it would be...

06:30.647 --> 06:32.563
Next.

06:33.398 --> 06:34.732
Okay.

06:34.734 --> 06:37.068
Um, I know she's a fan
of <i>The Canterbury Tales,</i>

06:37.070 --> 06:40.321
Mmm.
so I found...

06:40.323 --> 06:41.906
this cool map

06:41.908 --> 06:43.908
that illustrates the character's
journey through England.

06:43.910 --> 06:46.276
I thought we could put it
in a really nice frame.

06:46.278 --> 06:50.631
But she's got Google Maps
on her phone.

06:54.369 --> 06:56.453
I don't know
how to respond to that.

06:57.839 --> 06:59.924
Well, I hope it's
with a third good option,

06:59.926 --> 07:02.593
because these first two... blah.

07:04.396 --> 07:06.313
Okay.

07:06.315 --> 07:09.233
Well, uh, luckily,
I saved the best for last.

07:10.301 --> 07:11.352
Since Amy's a neuroscientist,

07:11.354 --> 07:13.187
I did some research
and found out

07:13.189 --> 07:14.805
that Santiago Ramón y Cajal,

07:14.807 --> 07:16.807
the father
of modern neuroscience,

07:16.809 --> 07:19.360
did lots of hand drawings
of brain cells.

07:19.362 --> 07:22.146
And I managed
to find

07:22.148 --> 07:25.583
this signed print.

07:25.585 --> 07:27.835
Wow.

07:27.837 --> 07:29.620
Oh, this is truly remarkable.

07:29.622 --> 07:31.539
Thank you.

07:31.541 --> 07:33.007
I think I'll keep it for myself.

07:36.845 --> 07:38.328
What about your girlfriend?

07:38.330 --> 07:40.131
It's too late.
I call dibs.

07:44.352 --> 07:46.971
This place is
really beautiful.

07:46.973 --> 07:49.223
Wah... romance ninja.

07:52.310 --> 07:53.360
Hey.

07:53.362 --> 07:55.062
Sorry we're late.

07:55.064 --> 07:56.447
No problem.
We just sat down.

07:56.449 --> 07:58.182
Mmm, would you like some wine?

07:58.184 --> 07:59.366
Yeah, fill her up.

08:01.686 --> 08:03.687
I'll tell you when to stop.

08:05.891 --> 08:07.291
Is everything okay?

08:07.293 --> 08:09.026
Terrific.
Couldn't be better.

08:09.028 --> 08:10.661
Oh, bite me.

08:12.497 --> 08:14.215
Look, we can still
have a nice night.

08:14.217 --> 08:15.499
Just tell me where it is.

08:15.501 --> 08:16.667
Maybe if you did what you said

08:16.669 --> 08:18.219
you were going to do,
I'd tell you.

08:19.004 --> 08:20.370
Uh, where what is?

08:20.372 --> 08:22.840
She hid my Xbox
like I'm a child.

08:24.059 --> 08:26.227
Yeah, and my mom got me
that for my birthday,

08:26.229 --> 08:28.712
so if you don't give
it back, I'm telling.

08:29.931 --> 08:31.548
I've been working
late every night.

08:31.550 --> 08:33.100
All I asked was that he

08:33.102 --> 08:34.852
clean the apartment
and do one load of laundry.

08:34.854 --> 08:36.070
But did he do it? No.

08:36.072 --> 08:37.888
He just kept on
playing that stupid game.

08:37.890 --> 08:39.523
You like pushing
buttons so much,

08:39.525 --> 08:41.991
try pushing them
on the washing machine.

08:43.727 --> 08:45.329
I said I'm sorry.

08:45.331 --> 08:48.415
Sorry doesn't clean
my underpants, buddy.

08:49.451 --> 08:52.670
I told you, turn
them inside out.

08:52.672 --> 08:55.906
And I told you to bite me.

08:55.908 --> 08:59.576
Trying to have
a magical night here, guys.

09:03.381 --> 09:04.581
Oh, son of a bitch.

09:04.583 --> 09:05.966
What?

09:05.968 --> 09:07.384
Nothing. Nothing.

09:07.386 --> 09:08.552
No, tell me.

09:08.554 --> 09:10.921
It's just this guy
I used to date.

09:11.756 --> 09:12.923
Oh.

09:12.925 --> 09:14.942
Until he cheated on me
with my friend Gretchen,

09:14.944 --> 09:16.443
who's here with him now.

09:16.445 --> 09:17.695
You're kidding.

09:17.697 --> 09:20.748
And it looks like she lost
a lot of weight, damn it.

09:22.901 --> 09:24.285
I know it's not ideal,

09:24.287 --> 09:25.786
but don't let them
ruin our night.

09:25.788 --> 09:27.037
No, you're totally right.

09:27.039 --> 09:29.540
She could be skinny
'cause she's dying.

09:30.441 --> 09:32.609
That's the spirit.

09:32.611 --> 09:33.878
You know what, screw them.

09:33.880 --> 09:35.612
Our night is going to be
way more special than theirs.

09:35.614 --> 09:37.281
Yeah.

09:38.583 --> 09:39.750
Uh-oh.

09:40.719 --> 09:42.419
What?

09:43.288 --> 09:46.590
Oh, you got to be kidding me.

09:46.592 --> 09:47.558
Oh, my God, yes.

09:47.560 --> 09:48.843
Of course
I'll marry you.

09:51.263 --> 09:52.544
Two can play this game.

09:52.546 --> 09:53.457
Penny...
Get up.

09:53.458 --> 09:55.008
All right.

09:57.000 --> 10:03.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

10:05.402 --> 10:06.936
It's nice that
all the people

10:06.938 --> 10:08.438
who are lonely
on Valentine's Day

10:08.440 --> 10:10.440
can come here tonight
and be together.

10:10.442 --> 10:13.109
Yeah, I'm really
looking forward to it.

10:13.111 --> 10:15.862
In fact, there's no place
I would rather be than here.

10:15.864 --> 10:17.646
Except on a date with anybody.

10:17.648 --> 10:19.365
Literally anybody.

10:20.817 --> 10:23.202
You know, you and I have
so much fun hanging out.

10:23.204 --> 10:24.337
If you were a girl,

10:24.339 --> 10:26.372
all our problems
would be solved.

10:29.777 --> 10:31.144
What?

10:31.146 --> 10:32.595
Oh, yeah, think about it.

10:32.597 --> 10:33.996
We'd hang out,

10:33.998 --> 10:36.049
we'd read comic books,
we'd see movies.

10:36.051 --> 10:38.667
It'd be like the best
relationship ever.

10:38.669 --> 10:41.220
That does sound nice.

10:41.222 --> 10:43.839
Then I'd take you home,
slip off your little black dress

10:43.841 --> 10:47.176
and just pile-drive you
into oblivion.

10:49.530 --> 10:51.330
What?

10:52.483 --> 10:54.233
Oh, I can't believe

10:54.235 --> 10:57.203
he's going to marry the girl
he cheated on me with.

10:57.205 --> 10:58.237
Isn't it kind of nice?

10:58.239 --> 10:59.855
I mean, he was with
the wrong person,

10:59.857 --> 11:01.240
and now he found
the right person.

11:01.242 --> 11:02.992
What, so I'm the <i>wrong</i> person?

11:02.994 --> 11:05.211
Maybe you want to be
with Gretchen, too.

11:06.630 --> 11:08.664
They do look happy.

11:08.666 --> 11:09.865
Yeah, maybe tonight.

11:09.867 --> 11:11.217
But a year from
now, he'll be

11:11.219 --> 11:13.836
crawling under the sink
looking for his Xbox.

11:14.704 --> 11:16.539
Well, he will.

11:17.707 --> 11:19.976
You know what? Why don't we
just forget about them

11:19.978 --> 11:21.544
and enjoy our Valentine's Day?

11:21.546 --> 11:23.262
Yes, absolutely.

11:29.237 --> 11:30.603
Now they're doing that phony

11:30.605 --> 11:32.855
link-arm-drink thingy.

11:32.857 --> 11:35.908
I totally taught him that.

11:36.744 --> 11:38.494
I thought we were
letting it go.

11:38.496 --> 11:40.780
We were; it's just...
it's not fair, okay?

11:40.782 --> 11:41.998
They're bad people.

11:42.000 --> 11:43.366
It's not supposed to end
happy for them;

11:43.368 --> 11:44.751
it's supposed to end
happy for me.

11:44.753 --> 11:46.536
Um...

11:46.538 --> 11:47.954
it did end happy for you.

11:47.956 --> 11:48.921
You're here with me.

11:48.923 --> 11:51.507
Yeah, yeah, I know.

11:51.509 --> 11:54.043
Okay, this is getting a little
hard to not take personally.

11:54.045 --> 11:55.595
Oh, come on, don't
make this about you.

11:55.597 --> 11:57.180
Oh, I'm not.
It's about you.

11:57.182 --> 11:58.264
Yeah, well, whatever, okay?

11:58.266 --> 11:59.799
I told you,
Valentine's Day sucks.

11:59.801 --> 12:01.768
This one does,
and you're the reason why.

12:01.770 --> 12:03.186
What?

12:03.188 --> 12:05.471
You know, compared to them,

12:05.473 --> 12:06.806
I'm feeling
pretty good about us.

12:06.808 --> 12:08.391
Me, too.

12:08.393 --> 12:11.144
How about we blow off
dessert, go home early...

12:11.146 --> 12:12.228
I'll do that laundry.

12:12.230 --> 12:13.596
Thank you.

12:13.598 --> 12:14.564
I love you.

12:14.566 --> 12:16.599
Love you, too.

12:16.601 --> 12:18.701
So where'd you hide it?

12:18.703 --> 12:20.620
Where you'd never look.

12:20.622 --> 12:23.873
Damn it, it's in the
washing machine.

12:30.780 --> 12:31.780
Hello.

12:31.782 --> 12:33.466
Hello.

12:33.468 --> 12:35.051
Happy Valentine's Day.

12:35.053 --> 12:37.587
Okay.

12:39.556 --> 12:40.956
Shall we go to dinner?

12:40.958 --> 12:42.625
Hang on.

12:42.627 --> 12:44.927
As you know, I had planned
a traditional evening

12:44.929 --> 12:46.429
of romance and gifts.

12:46.431 --> 12:47.647
Yes,

12:47.649 --> 12:48.797
and as you know,

12:48.799 --> 12:51.434
I planned to pretend
to enjoy it.

12:52.569 --> 12:55.154
I've been working on
this facial expression all day.

12:57.441 --> 12:59.992
And I appreciate your effort,

12:59.994 --> 13:01.477
but upon contemplation,

13:01.479 --> 13:03.446
I decided I was being selfish.

13:03.448 --> 13:05.748
So, I canceled
our dinner reservations

13:05.750 --> 13:07.600
and came up
with an even better way

13:07.602 --> 13:09.168
to celebrate Valentine's Day.

13:09.170 --> 13:11.003
What is that?

13:11.005 --> 13:12.288
By doing none of it--

13:12.290 --> 13:13.456
no dinner,

13:13.458 --> 13:15.174
no romance, no gifts.

13:15.176 --> 13:17.793
We stay here,
order a pizza

13:17.795 --> 13:19.679
and watch one
of your beloved

13:19.681 --> 13:21.881
Star War Trek things.

13:23.050 --> 13:24.217
Really?

13:24.219 --> 13:25.568
Well, that's what

13:25.570 --> 13:26.702
you'd love, isn't it?

13:26.704 --> 13:28.337
More than anything.

13:28.339 --> 13:30.406
Well, then...

13:30.408 --> 13:32.341
that's what we're going to do.

13:34.228 --> 13:35.361
Well...

13:35.363 --> 13:37.313
I don't know what to say.

13:37.315 --> 13:39.848
This is the most thoughtful gift

13:39.850 --> 13:42.017
that anyone's ever given me.

13:42.019 --> 13:43.819
And that's including
an amazing gift

13:43.821 --> 13:45.738
that I gave myself
earlier today.

13:47.908 --> 13:50.326
I'm your girlfriend.
That's my job.

13:50.328 --> 13:53.963
And I know gift-giving
puts a lot of pressure on you,

13:53.965 --> 13:57.199
so whatever you got me,
you can return.

13:58.802 --> 14:00.419
No.

14:00.421 --> 14:03.222
No, after everything you
didn't do for me tonight,

14:03.224 --> 14:04.974
I want you to have it.

14:05.893 --> 14:06.826
What's this?

14:06.828 --> 14:08.544
Read it.

14:08.546 --> 14:09.845
"Sheldon Cooper,

14:09.847 --> 14:12.315
Caltech University
employee information"?

14:12.317 --> 14:13.516
At the bottom.

14:13.518 --> 14:17.436
"In case of emergency,
please contact...

14:17.438 --> 14:19.655
Amy Farrah Fowler."

14:21.775 --> 14:23.943
And there's my phone number.

14:26.914 --> 14:31.117
This is the most beautiful gift
you could've ever given me.

14:31.119 --> 14:32.618
Well, I thought,

14:32.620 --> 14:36.672
if I have a stroke
or a kidney stone,

14:36.674 --> 14:38.907
who would I want
to share that with?

14:42.429 --> 14:44.964
And you picked me.

14:44.966 --> 14:46.816
It's like you said--

14:46.818 --> 14:48.551
you're my girlfriend.

14:48.553 --> 14:49.885
Oh, Sheldon.

14:49.887 --> 14:51.687
Yeah...

14:54.608 --> 14:56.492
Okay.

14:56.494 --> 14:59.395
Stop ruining Valentine's Day
and order my pizza.

15:04.534 --> 15:05.601
Night.

15:05.603 --> 15:06.886
Yep.

15:15.329 --> 15:16.945
You know what?

15:16.947 --> 15:18.297
That was pretty
crappy of you.

15:18.299 --> 15:21.634
I mean, all I wanted to do
was give you a great night,

15:21.636 --> 15:24.170
and it's like you-you went out
of your way to destroy it.

15:24.172 --> 15:25.421
Yeah, I know.

15:25.423 --> 15:26.756
I'm a total bitch.

15:26.758 --> 15:28.574
I'm not saying that.
Well, I am.

15:28.576 --> 15:30.593
Fine, you win.
You're a bitch.

15:32.596 --> 15:35.147
Why couldn't we
just have a nice time?

15:35.149 --> 15:37.600
I don't know.

15:37.602 --> 15:40.353
Maybe 'cause things are going
so well between us lately

15:40.355 --> 15:42.304
and I've been really happy.

15:48.111 --> 15:51.831
Okay, you're gonna have to make
a lot more sense than that.

15:51.833 --> 15:55.651
Obviously, I have
some commitment issues.

15:55.653 --> 15:58.204
Glaringly obvious.
Go on.

15:58.206 --> 15:59.988
As long as things keep going
great between us,

15:59.990 --> 16:01.424
you'll keep asking me
to marry you,

16:01.426 --> 16:02.958
and eventually I'm gonna
end up saying yes,

16:02.960 --> 16:04.593
and then we're gonna be
married forever,

16:04.595 --> 16:07.430
and the whole thing
just freaks me out.

16:09.350 --> 16:11.467
Okay.

16:11.469 --> 16:13.719
I know I propose a lot.

16:17.524 --> 16:19.725
So how about this?

16:21.311 --> 16:24.897
I promise I will never ask you
to marry me again.

16:24.899 --> 16:26.816
What... what do you mean?

16:26.818 --> 16:28.367
Are you breaking up with me?

16:28.369 --> 16:29.402
No.

16:29.404 --> 16:30.569
No, no, no, no.

16:30.571 --> 16:33.122
But if someday you decide
you want to get married,

16:33.124 --> 16:34.874
you have to propose to me.

16:35.675 --> 16:37.526
Really?
Yes.

16:37.528 --> 16:39.378
It's all on you.

16:39.380 --> 16:41.530
But I got to tell you,
when the time comes,

16:41.532 --> 16:42.715
I want the whole nine yards.

16:42.717 --> 16:44.417
I want you down
on one knee, flowers.

16:44.419 --> 16:46.502
I want to be swept off my feet.

16:48.772 --> 16:50.072
Yeah, you got it.

16:50.074 --> 16:51.257
And I'm cool with surprises.

16:51.259 --> 16:54.326
But nothing on a Jumbotron.

16:54.328 --> 16:57.063
I don't want to cry
on a big screen like that.

16:59.266 --> 17:00.483
Okay.

17:02.853 --> 17:04.319
You know what?

17:04.321 --> 17:06.221
This might be the wine talking,

17:06.223 --> 17:09.575
but I have a very important
question to ask you.

17:10.444 --> 17:11.926
You do?

17:12.762 --> 17:14.630
Leonard Hofstadter...

17:15.464 --> 17:16.665
Yes?

17:18.268 --> 17:20.903
...will you be my valentine?

17:22.839 --> 17:24.623
Sorry. Maybe next year.

17:27.794 --> 17:28.928
I'm just kidding!

17:28.930 --> 17:31.464
Romance ninja.
Let's have sex! Wah!

17:36.137 --> 17:37.603
Thank you, guys,
for doing this.

17:37.605 --> 17:39.271
We're glad you
could make it.

17:39.273 --> 17:42.274
Usually I spend Valentine's Day
sad and alone.

17:42.276 --> 17:44.760
This year, I'm just sad.

17:47.096 --> 17:49.431
What is it about this holiday
that makes people so unhappy?

17:49.433 --> 17:50.399
I know.

17:50.401 --> 17:52.118
I hate myself
most of the time,

17:52.120 --> 17:55.738
but tonight's the night
I know everyone else does, too.

17:55.740 --> 17:57.957
I think you're cool.

17:58.792 --> 18:00.993
Great.

18:03.046 --> 18:04.547
I got to tell you,

18:04.549 --> 18:07.282
we've got to stop beating
ourselves up like this.

18:08.802 --> 18:10.703
Excuse me, everybody.

18:10.705 --> 18:12.271
Can I have your attention,
please?

18:17.394 --> 18:19.595
We're all here tonight
because...

18:19.597 --> 18:22.181
we have no one to be with.

18:22.183 --> 18:26.986
But... that doesn't
make us mutants.

18:26.988 --> 18:29.989
The only mutants here
are in these comic books.

18:31.858 --> 18:35.077
We've got to stop defining
our self-worth

18:35.079 --> 18:37.663
by whether or not
we're in a relationship.

18:38.665 --> 18:40.950
You know what I see
when I look around?

18:42.068 --> 18:44.036
I see a room
full of great people.

18:46.106 --> 18:48.340
So let's give ourselves a break.

18:48.342 --> 18:50.593
We are a community,

18:50.595 --> 18:51.760
and as long
as we have

18:51.762 --> 18:53.345
each other,

18:53.347 --> 18:55.497
we're never truly alone.

19:02.722 --> 19:04.006
That was cool.

19:04.008 --> 19:05.858
What you said.

19:05.860 --> 19:08.110
You really think so?

19:08.112 --> 19:09.728
Yeah, I do.

19:09.730 --> 19:10.896
Thank you.

19:13.416 --> 19:15.034
Uh...

19:15.036 --> 19:16.351
Would you like to, uh...

19:16.353 --> 19:19.405
get a cup...
a cup of coffee or...?

19:19.407 --> 19:21.240
Okay.

19:26.713 --> 19:28.747
Later, losers!

19:45.139 --> 19:47.390
Hello?

19:47.392 --> 19:49.209
Another medical emergency?

19:49.211 --> 19:52.045
What's wrong with him now?

19:52.047 --> 19:55.949
I seriously doubt he was bitten
by a Chinese bird spider.

19:57.568 --> 20:00.186
How exactly does a bump
feel Asian?

20:01.822 --> 20:04.073
Just put him on the phone.

20:04.075 --> 20:06.359
Sheldon, I am not driving
over there again.

20:07.194 --> 20:08.745
Because I drove
over there yesterday

20:08.747 --> 20:10.713
for a brain tumor
that turned out to be

20:10.715 --> 20:12.999
an ice cream headache.

20:13.001 --> 20:17.086
Yes, I still want to be
your emergency contact.

20:18.556 --> 20:21.808
Yes, you can eat
your ice cream too fast

20:21.810 --> 20:24.010
and also have a brain tumor.

20:26.880 --> 20:29.048
I'm on my way.

20:30.818 --> 20:32.519
Brain tumor
would explain a lot.
