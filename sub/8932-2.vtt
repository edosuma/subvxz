Ha, afraid to be alone.

Oh Bert,
I didn't mean it that way.

05:15.915 --> 05:18.718

Evergreen Mountain!

Evergreen Mountain?!

that to stop Bert Raccoon.

Where are you going to
get all the equipment?

06:58.117 --> 07:00.086
Hah! No problem.

07:00.086 --> 07:01.721
I'll just, um...

Oh yeah! I, I hadn't
thought about that.

07:05.892 --> 07:08.795
Cedric, doesn't your
father have some equipment?

07:08.795 --> 07:11.864
Pop was into
climbing a few years back,

07:11.864 --> 07:15.868
which is weird, because he's
never been the athletic type.

07:15.868 --> 07:19.272
Gosh Cedric, you could
ask him to help Bert out.

07:20.206 --> 07:23.142
Ask Pop...
to help someone out?

07:23.142 --> 07:25.845
I'd rather climb the mountain.

07:28.481 --> 07:31.784
I wish I hadn't promised
Sophia I'd do this.

07:33.085 --> 07:35.588

07:35.588 --> 07:36.856

Uhm, Pop doesn't
sound too happy today.

07:40.827 --> 07:42.562
Pig 1: Because dividend
checks are late.

07:42.562 --> 07:45.064
Pig 2: It was the wrong day
to ask for a raise.

07:45.064 --> 07:46.299
Pig 3: He can't take a joke.

The mountain
climbing gear you have?

07:59.078 --> 08:03.349
I was wondering if I
could borrow it... Pop?

08:04.517 --> 08:07.620
Why would you
want my equipment?

08:07.620 --> 08:11.424
Well, it's not really
for me. It's for Bert.

it!

08:26.639 --> 08:29.709
I know, Pop,
but he's not afraid.

08:29.709 --> 08:32.512
And he seems
determined to do it,

08:32.512 --> 08:35.381
