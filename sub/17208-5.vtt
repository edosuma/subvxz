00:00.918 --> 00:02.878
<i>Okay, here we go.</i>

00:02.878 --> 00:05.297
<i>Jane got married to Michael,</i>

00:02.878 --> 00:05.297
<i>but she had a son with Rafael.</i>

00:05.297 --> 00:06.423
<i>And Michael and Rafael were...</i>

00:06.423 --> 00:09.050
<i>yeah, pretty tense.</i>

00:09.050 --> 00:11.178
<i>Also tense, Jane's father,</i>

00:09.050 --> 00:11.178
<i>Rogelio.</i>

00:11.178 --> 00:13.388
<i>See, he was in a race</i>

00:11.178 --> 00:13.388
<i>with his rival, Esteban,</i>

00:13.388 --> 00:14.890
<i>to make the leap</i>

00:13.388 --> 00:14.890
<i>from telenovelas</i>

00:14.890 --> 00:16.642
<i>to American television.</i>

00:16.642 --> 00:18.644
<i>Unfortunately,</i>

00:16.642 --> 00:18.644
<i>Esteban had the lead.</i>

00:18.644 --> 00:22.189
ROGELIO:

00:18.644 --> 00:22.189
<i>Esteban got the part</i>

00:22.189 --> 00:24.775
NARRATOR:

00:22.189 --> 00:24.775
<i>But, Rogelio had a new</i>

00:22.189 --> 00:24.775
<i>best bro, Rafael...</i>

00:24.775 --> 00:26.527
He's a real cutie.

00:26.527 --> 00:28.445
<i>...who he recently discovered</i>

00:26.527 --> 00:28.445
<i>was handsome.</i>

00:28.445 --> 00:30.823
<i>And Rafael said he'd introduce</i>

00:28.445 --> 00:30.823
<i>Rogelio to his friend,</i>

00:30.823 --> 00:32.491
<i>a big-time Hollywood producer.</i>

00:32.491 --> 00:35.076
<i>Oh, and Xiomara was also</i>

00:32.491 --> 00:35.076
<i>looking for a change.</i>

00:35.076 --> 00:37.329
<i>And she decided to search</i>

00:35.076 --> 00:37.329
<i>for a new career.</i>

00:37.329 --> 00:38.956
<i>And Alba had a new career, too,</i>

00:38.956 --> 00:40.624
<i>at the Marbella gift shop.</i>

00:40.624 --> 00:42.209
<i>And while we're on Alba,</i>

00:42.209 --> 00:44.545
<i>Jane was basing her novel</i>

00:42.209 --> 00:44.545
<i>on her grandma's life.</i>

00:44.545 --> 00:46.129
<i>Only Alba didn't want</i>

00:46.129 --> 00:48.507
<i>to share the letters</i>

00:46.129 --> 00:48.507
<i>from her estranged sister.</i>

00:48.507 --> 00:50.885
<i>And speaking of complicated</i>

00:48.507 --> 00:50.885
<i>family dynamics,</i>

00:50.885 --> 00:53.094
<i>Rafael's mother</i>

00:50.885 --> 00:53.094
<i>was a crime lord.</i>

00:53.094 --> 00:54.346
<i>And she was murdered!</i>

00:54.346 --> 00:55.764
<i>And that she left a Bible</i>

00:55.764 --> 00:57.432
<i>with some mysterious words</i>

00:55.764 --> 00:57.432
<i>underlined.</i>

DENNIS:

00:57.432 --> 00:59.518
Angels guard the sun.

00:59.518 --> 01:01.353
NARRATOR:

00:59.518 --> 01:01.353
<i>I know, cray-cray, right?</i>

01:01.353 --> 01:02.897
<i>Let's see, what else?</i>

01:02.897 --> 01:04.523
<i>What else? Um...</i>

01:04.523 --> 01:06.567
<i>Jane and Michael were</i>

01:04.523 --> 01:06.567
<i>moving out of their place,</i>

01:06.567 --> 01:07.985
<i>so you might see boxes.</i>

01:07.985 --> 01:09.653
<i>Oh, I know what else!</i>

01:09.653 --> 01:11.655
<i>There was a new love affair</i>

01:09.653 --> 01:11.655
<i>sweeping the Marbella--</i>

01:11.655 --> 01:15.075
<i>Petra and Scott. Yeah, that</i>

01:11.655 --> 01:15.075
<i>Scott-- the one Jane hated.</i>

01:15.075 --> 01:17.202
<i>But here's the thing,</i>

01:15.075 --> 01:17.202
<i>it wasn't really Petra.</i>

01:17.202 --> 01:19.204
<i>It was her twin sister,</i>

01:17.202 --> 01:19.204
<i>Anezka.</i>

01:19.204 --> 01:21.164
<i>See, Anezka had</i>

01:19.204 --> 01:21.164
<i>paralyzed Petra</i>

01:21.164 --> 01:22.416
<i>and taken her place.</i>

01:22.416 --> 01:23.918
<i>And finally,</i>

01:22.416 --> 01:23.918
( shrieks )

01:23.918 --> 01:25.419
<i>after three freakin' months,</i>

01:25.419 --> 01:26.712
<i>Jane realized...</i>

01:26.712 --> 01:28.171
I don't think that's Petra.

01:28.171 --> 01:29.631
<i>Which, my friends,</i>

01:29.631 --> 01:32.342
<i>is where we left off.</i>

01:32.342 --> 01:33.928
<i>As you all well know,</i>

01:33.928 --> 01:36.597
<i>our Jane always</i>

01:33.928 --> 01:36.597
<i>had strong opinions.</i>

01:36.597 --> 01:38.348
Okay, here's why I think you

01:38.348 --> 01:40.225
should reevaluate

01:38.348 --> 01:40.225
your Disney World decision.

01:40.225 --> 01:41.894
Jane--

01:40.225 --> 01:41.894
Just hear me out.

01:41.894 --> 01:43.812
Lina's sister won free

01:41.894 --> 01:43.812
tickets on the radio,

01:43.812 --> 01:45.146
so it won't cost anything.

01:45.146 --> 01:46.481
And yes, it's

01:45.146 --> 01:46.481
a school day,

01:46.481 --> 01:47.816
but we'll be home by 8:00

01:47.816 --> 01:49.484
and I'll do all my

01:47.816 --> 01:49.484
classwork in advance,

01:49.484 --> 01:50.819
I promise.

01:51.904 --> 01:55.032
Please, Abuela.

01:51.904 --> 01:55.032
You can trust me.

01:55.032 --> 01:57.868
( speaks Spanish ):

01:55.032 --> 01:57.868
I'll think about it.

01:55.032 --> 01:57.868
After La Usurpadora...

01:57.868 --> 02:00.287
NARRATOR:

01:57.868 --> 02:00.287
<i>Ah, yes. Priorities.</i>

02:00.287 --> 02:01.580
I don't care that Paulina's

02:01.580 --> 02:03.040
pretending to be her sister,

02:03.040 --> 02:05.000
she needs to end up

02:03.040 --> 02:05.000
with Carlos Daniel

02:05.000 --> 02:07.461
and he needs to stay

02:05.000 --> 02:07.461
the heck away from Gemma.

02:07.461 --> 02:08.754
<i>Like I said,</i>

02:08.754 --> 02:11.048
<i>Jane always</i>

02:08.754 --> 02:11.048
<i>had strong opinions.</i>

02:11.048 --> 02:12.883
<i>So when she was unsure...</i>

02:12.883 --> 02:14.969
<i>well, it was a pretty big deal.</i>

02:14.969 --> 02:17.888
On the one hand, if Anezka did

02:14.969 --> 02:17.888
paralyze and impersonate Petra,

02:17.888 --> 02:19.473
well, then so many things

02:17.888 --> 02:19.473
would make sense.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.809
<i>There's a sentence</i>

02:19.473 --> 02:21.809
<i>you don't hear every day.</i>

02:21.809 --> 02:23.685
But on the other hand,

02:21.809 --> 02:23.685
it's...

02:23.685 --> 02:24.937
<i>Straight out of a telenovela?</i>

02:24.937 --> 02:26.897
Crazy.

02:24.937 --> 02:26.897
Totally crazy.

02:26.897 --> 02:28.148
But what if it's true?

02:28.148 --> 02:29.566
Then we have to do something.

02:29.566 --> 02:31.902
But what if we do something

02:29.566 --> 02:31.902
and it's not true?

02:31.902 --> 02:33.278
Then things will

02:31.902 --> 02:33.278
get even worse.

02:33.278 --> 02:34.989
<i>Hard to imagine</i>

02:33.278 --> 02:34.989
<i>things getting worse</i>

02:34.989 --> 02:36.239
<i>between Petra and Jane.</i>

02:36.239 --> 02:38.075
( yelling )

02:38.075 --> 02:40.243
<i>Or Petra and Rafael,</i>

02:38.075 --> 02:40.243
<i>for that matter.</i>

02:40.243 --> 02:41.829
And I will tell the cops,

02:41.829 --> 02:43.538
unless you sign your

02:41.829 --> 02:43.538
shares over to me.

02:43.538 --> 02:44.957
You have 24 hours.

02:44.957 --> 02:46.792
Jane...

02:46.792 --> 02:48.127
it can't be true.

02:50.629 --> 02:52.547
But what if it is true?

02:52.547 --> 02:54.800
No, stop, I just

02:52.547 --> 02:54.800
convinced myself it couldn't be.

02:54.800 --> 02:56.426
But that would explain

02:54.800 --> 02:56.426
her weird behavior.

02:56.426 --> 02:58.219
Maybe we should see

02:56.426 --> 02:58.219
what the cop thinks.

02:58.219 --> 03:02.057
The cop thinks you need more

02:58.219 --> 03:02.057
evidence, as discussed.

03:02.057 --> 03:03.934
Thanks.

03:03.934 --> 03:05.477
You okay?

03:03.934 --> 03:05.477
NARRATOR:<i> Don't worry,</i>

03:05.477 --> 03:07.228
<i>we'll be getting back</i>

03:05.477 --> 03:07.228
<i>to that teddy bear.</i>

03:07.228 --> 03:09.064
Yeah, yeah, just sore.

03:09.064 --> 03:10.398
Trying to get back in shape

03:10.398 --> 03:12.484
so I can pass my physical

03:10.398 --> 03:12.484
for work.

03:12.484 --> 03:15.236
Oh. Well hey, if you ever want

03:12.484 --> 03:15.236
to use the Marbella gym...

03:16.404 --> 03:17.906
Oh, maybe I'll take you up

03:16.404 --> 03:17.906
on that.

03:17.906 --> 03:19.240
Cool, I'm there most days

03:19.240 --> 03:21.200
around lunch, so,

03:19.240 --> 03:21.200
hope to see you.

03:21.200 --> 03:23.162
Cool, cool.

03:21.200 --> 03:23.162
Bye, buddy.

03:23.162 --> 03:24.913
( kissing )

03:24.913 --> 03:26.247
Oh. Ha.

03:26.247 --> 03:28.333
All right. Bye. Bye.

03:28.333 --> 03:30.627
NARRATOR:

03:28.333 --> 03:30.627
<i>Let's see how long she</i>

03:28.333 --> 03:30.627
<i>can wait before...</i>

03:30.627 --> 03:32.379
That was sweet, huh?

03:32.379 --> 03:34.756
Him inviting you to work out

03:32.379 --> 03:34.756
at the Marbella?

03:34.756 --> 03:36.758
Yeah.

03:36.758 --> 03:39.094
So...are you

03:36.758 --> 03:39.094
gonna go? Ha.

03:39.094 --> 03:40.554
Maybe.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.597
I mean, it's just that

03:40.554 --> 03:42.597
Rafael is making an effort.

03:42.597 --> 03:44.224
and it would be, you know,

03:44.224 --> 03:45.934
nice if you said yes

03:44.224 --> 03:45.934
to the date.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.268
Not a date.

03:47.268 --> 03:48.979
Sorry, sorry, the meet up.

03:48.979 --> 03:50.647
The workout, the hang.

03:50.647 --> 03:52.024
If I say yes,

03:52.024 --> 03:53.984
you promise not to make

03:52.024 --> 03:53.984
a big deal out of it?

03:53.984 --> 03:55.944
Yes. Yeah, of course.

03:55.944 --> 03:57.154
No problem.

03:57.154 --> 03:58.613
I'll text him.

03:57.154 --> 03:58.613
Cool.

03:58.613 --> 04:00.615

Daddy and Michael are going

04:09.708 --> 04:12.252

04:12.252 --> 04:15.756
Ooh! Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.

04:12.252 --> 04:15.756
Whoo!

04:23.471 --> 04:25.057
They're really

04:23.471 --> 04:25.057
going on a date?

04:25.057 --> 04:26.474
Yes!

04:26.474 --> 04:28.435
Well, we're not allowed to

04:26.474 --> 04:28.435
call it that, but yes.

04:28.435 --> 04:31.146
Honestly, I feel like they're

04:28.435 --> 04:31.146
putting the past behind them,

04:31.146 --> 04:33.148
finally.

04:31.146 --> 04:33.148
( scoffs )

04:33.148 --> 04:34.775
It's nice when

04:33.148 --> 04:34.775
people do that.

04:34.775 --> 04:36.276
Move on from the past.

Yes, last rehearsal

before recital,

04:41.240 --> 04:42.699
full house.

04:42.699 --> 04:45.035
Come on, Abuela. I really

04:42.699 --> 04:45.035
want you to reconsider

04:45.035 --> 04:46.453
showing me your

04:45.035 --> 04:46.453
sister's letters.

04:46.453 --> 04:47.871
NARRATOR:

04:46.453 --> 04:47.871
<i>A sister, I'll remind you,</i>

04:47.871 --> 04:49.957
<i>she hasn't spoken to</i>

<i>in 42 years.</i>

04:49.957 --> 04:52.709
( speaks Spanish ):

04:49.957 --> 04:52.709
It's just stories about

04:49.957 --> 04:52.709
people you don't know.

04:52.709 --> 04:54.544
( speaks English ):

04:52.709 --> 04:54.544
Exactly. I don't know them.

04:54.544 --> 04:56.546
And I've always wanted to

04:54.544 --> 04:56.546
learn about our family.

04:56.546 --> 04:57.881
You know that.

04:57.881 --> 04:59.299
Plus, I'm writing this novel

04:59.299 --> 05:01.260
and those letters are full of

04:59.299 --> 05:01.260
details, right?

05:01.260 --> 05:04.512
Things you can't make up.

05:01.260 --> 05:04.512
Please, Abuela.

05:04.512 --> 05:07.057
( speaks Spanish ):

05:04.512 --> 05:07.057
I don't want to start

05:04.512 --> 05:07.057
talking about my sister.

05:07.057 --> 05:09.226
( speaks English ):

05:07.057 --> 05:09.226
And you won't have

05:07.057 --> 05:09.226
to, I promise.

05:09.226 --> 05:11.270
I won't bring her up again.

05:11.270 --> 05:13.147
You can trust me.

05:14.148 --> 05:16.524
Thank you! I love you!

Mwah!

XIOMARA:

05:17.818 --> 05:19.820
It was only

05:17.818 --> 05:19.820
a matter of time.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.822
You always give in to her.

12:43.012 --> 12:46.307
face masks from the spa

12:46.307 --> 12:47.684
and spy on them.

12:47.684 --> 12:49.436
( chuckles )

12:49.436 --> 12:50.811
You're kidding, right?

12:50.811 --> 12:53.940
We can't do that.

12:53.940 --> 12:56.568
NARRATOR:

12:53.940 --> 12:56.568
<i>But we can.</i>

12:56.568 --> 12:59.529

12:59.529 --> 13:00.739
Wow.

13:00.739 --> 13:02.699
( chuckles ):

13:00.739 --> 13:02.699
A lot of reps.

13:02.699 --> 13:04.325
Oh, you just got

13:02.699 --> 13:04.325
to push yourself.

13:04.325 --> 13:05.660
Oh, yeah.

13:13.585 --> 13:15.336
So what's your sched...

13:15.336 --> 13:17.297
...ule like?

13:15.336 --> 13:17.297
Like, what do you do every day?

13:17.297 --> 13:18.757
Uh, cardio four times a week.

13:18.757 --> 13:20.091
Monday, Wednesday--

13:18.757 --> 13:20.091
chest and back

13:20.091 --> 13:21.551
Tuesday, Thursday--

13:20.091 --> 13:21.551
bis and tris,

13:21.551 --> 13:22.969

NARRATOR:

13:22.969 --> 13:24.554
<i>I got to get to the gym more.</i>

13:24.554 --> 13:25.764
Wow.

13:25.764 --> 13:27.181
Do you have time

13:25.764 --> 13:27.181
for anything else?

13:27.181 --> 13:28.516
You just got to prioritize it.

13:28.516 --> 13:30.184
Oh yeah, it's clearly a...

13:30.184 --> 13:32.646
clearly a big priority.

13:32.646 --> 13:34.939
See, I'm not trying to get

13:32.646 --> 13:34.939
that intense for my physical.

13:34.939 --> 13:36.399
I just kind of

13:34.939 --> 13:36.399
got to, you know,

13:36.399 --> 13:37.692
build up my endurance.

13:37.692 --> 13:39.152
Uh, keep my BP low.

13:39.152 --> 13:40.779
Got it.

13:40.779 --> 13:42.238
( grunting )

13:44.616 --> 13:47.994
So, um, did you think

13:44.616 --> 13:47.994
about the words

13:47.994 --> 13:50.871
your mom underlined

13:47.994 --> 13:50.871
in the Bible?

13:50.871 --> 13:52.873
Angels guard the sun.

13:50.871 --> 13:52.873
Yeah, no idea.

13:52.873 --> 13:55.209
Did your mom ever mention--

13:52.873 --> 13:55.209
You know, I'd just rather

13:55.209 --> 13:56.753
not talk about my dead mom, the

13:55.209 --> 13:56.753
criminal,

13:56.753 --> 13:58.296
( chuckles )

13:56.753 --> 13:58.296
in the middle of the day,

13:58.296 --> 13:59.673
in the middle of my gym.

13:59.673 --> 14:01.299
( chuckling ):

13:59.673 --> 14:01.299
Yeah, yeah. Gotcha. Sorry.

14:01.299 --> 14:02.634
It's okay.

14:03.760 --> 14:05.094
You like baseball?

14:05.094 --> 14:06.513
( grunting )

14:06.513 --> 14:08.765
Football.

14:06.513 --> 14:08.765
Sure. Sure, sure.

14:08.765 --> 14:09.932
<i>Game of Thrones?</i>

14:09.932 --> 14:11.601
Hodor! Hod--

14:09.932 --> 14:11.601
You know, I'm just

14:11.601 --> 14:12.977
really not a big talker

14:11.601 --> 14:12.977
in the gym.

14:12.977 --> 14:14.937
Right.

14:12.977 --> 14:14.937
Got to focus on the reps.

14:16.356 --> 14:17.774

14:17.774 --> 14:19.818
All right.

14:17.774 --> 14:19.818
Whoops. Ha.

14:19.818 --> 14:21.152
Um...

14:22.737 --> 14:24.698
Thanks again.

14:22.737 --> 14:24.698
You got it.

14:25.990 --> 14:27.408
( sighs ):

14:25.990 --> 14:27.408
Oh, God.

14:28.993 --> 14:30.537
Oh, my sweatshirt.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.163
( sighs )

14:33.122 --> 14:35.249
You still free to meet up?

14:35.249 --> 14:37.210
Yeah, just give me

14:35.249 --> 14:37.210
ten minutes to shower.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.670
WOMAN:

14:37.210 --> 14:38.670
We can meet in the shower.

14:38.670 --> 14:40.213
RAFAEL:

14:38.670 --> 14:40.213
Mm.

14:40.213 --> 14:42.882
JANE:

14:40.213 --> 14:42.882
<i>So...how was the gym?</i>

14:42.882 --> 14:44.217
It was fine.

14:44.217 --> 14:46.553
W-what do you mean, fine? W-what

14:44.217 --> 14:46.553
happened?

14:46.553 --> 14:47.846
He's just...

14:47.846 --> 14:49.848
( exhales )

14:49.848 --> 14:51.140
What?

14:51.140 --> 14:52.350
Nothing.

14:52.350 --> 14:53.893
Michael.

14:52.350 --> 14:53.893
Such a player!

14:53.893 --> 14:56.354
With his muscles

14:53.893 --> 14:56.354
and his flirting.

14:56.354 --> 14:58.439
He was flirting with you?

14:58.439 --> 14:59.733
No, not me.

14:59.733 --> 15:01.984
But as we were leaving

14:59.733 --> 15:01.984
there was a woman,

15:01.984 --> 15:05.112
clearly married,

15:01.984 --> 15:05.112
he said to meet in his place,

15:05.112 --> 15:06.989
in the shower.

15:06.989 --> 15:08.282
He has Mateo.

15:08.282 --> 15:11.118
It's that she's married,

15:08.282 --> 15:11.118
that's the point.

15:11.118 --> 15:12.871
Anyway, forget I said anything.

15:12.871 --> 15:14.330
NARRATOR:

15:12.871 --> 15:14.330
<i>Yeah, right.</i>

15:14.330 --> 15:16.123
We just have nothing in common,

15:14.330 --> 15:16.123
that's it.

15:16.123 --> 15:19.878
XIOMARA:

15:16.123 --> 15:19.878
<i>The whole family dynamic</i>

15:16.123 --> 15:19.878
<i>is complicated...</i>

15:19.878 --> 15:22.004
and Jane didn't

15:19.878 --> 15:22.004
respect that.

15:22.004 --> 15:24.298
But come on, Ma.

15:24.298 --> 15:26.509
She would never do anything

15:24.298 --> 15:26.509
intentionally to hurt you,

15:26.509 --> 15:27.719
you know that.

15:27.719 --> 15:29.178
( speaks Spanish ):

15:27.719 --> 15:29.178
I don't want her

15:29.178 --> 15:32.515
in touch with my sister.

15:29.178 --> 15:32.515
Or anyone in my family.

15:32.515 --> 15:34.225
Does she understand that?

15:34.225 --> 15:36.770
( speaks English ):

15:34.225 --> 15:36.770
Yes, I understand that

15:34.225 --> 15:36.770
a hundred percent.

15:36.770 --> 15:38.521
Good. Then I think I can

15:36.770 --> 15:38.521
get her to talk to you.

15:38.521 --> 15:40.231
Speaking from

15:38.521 --> 15:40.231
experience,

15:40.231 --> 15:41.858
it's good when she's

15:40.231 --> 15:41.858
really pissed

15:41.858 --> 15:43.902
to give her at least

15:41.858 --> 15:43.902
48 hours to cool down.

15:43.902 --> 15:45.486
Mm.

15:43.902 --> 15:45.486
( knocking on door )

15:45.486 --> 15:47.029
Oh, that's your dad.

15:47.029 --> 15:49.031
What's this big thing he wants

15:47.029 --> 15:49.031
to talk to us about?

15:49.031 --> 15:50.575
Oh, I have no idea.

15:50.575 --> 15:52.744
So, Rafael worked his magic

15:50.575 --> 15:52.744
and got me an audition

15:52.744 --> 15:54.495
for the film...

15:52.744 --> 15:54.495
( gasps )

15:54.495 --> 15:56.623
despite my unfortunate meeting

15:54.495 --> 15:56.623
with the producer.

15:56.623 --> 15:57.916
Ro, that's so great.

15:57.916 --> 15:59.918
Yeah, congratulations.

15:57.916 --> 15:59.918
Wait.

15:59.918 --> 16:01.669
I went to the studio

15:59.918 --> 16:01.669
and read the script.

16:01.669 --> 16:03.421
It's very secretive,

16:01.669 --> 16:03.421
that means it's good,

16:03.421 --> 16:05.005
probably a festival opener.

16:05.005 --> 16:06.800
Hopefully not Sundance.

16:06.800 --> 16:08.760
Finding a flattering parka

16:06.800 --> 16:08.760
will be hell.

16:08.760 --> 16:11.679
Anyway, it turns out

16:08.760 --> 16:11.679
that if I get the part...

16:11.679 --> 16:15.892
I will have to reveal

16:11.679 --> 16:15.892
all of myself on film.

16:15.892 --> 16:17.811
Yeah, well, that's

16:15.892 --> 16:17.811
what acting is, right?

16:17.811 --> 16:19.353
Raw, emotional, vulnerable.

16:19.353 --> 16:20.980
I mean my penis.

16:19.353 --> 16:20.980
( quiet gasps )

16:20.980 --> 16:22.941
I will have to

16:20.980 --> 16:22.941
reveal my penis.

16:22.941 --> 16:24.984
Oh.

16:22.941 --> 16:24.984
The role requires

16:24.984 --> 16:26.486
full frontal nudity.

16:26.486 --> 16:28.780
Wow.

16:28.780 --> 16:30.490
Fassbender did it,

16:28.780 --> 16:30.490
it's a great career move,

16:30.490 --> 16:33.618
plus, obviously, I'm

16:30.490 --> 16:33.618
extremely comfortable with it.

16:33.618 --> 16:35.077
But of course,

16:35.077 --> 16:36.955
I want to make sure

16:36.955 --> 16:38.832
you are comfortable.

16:36.955 --> 16:38.832
Me?

16:38.832 --> 16:40.959
Well, Michael and Xiomara

16:38.832 --> 16:40.959
already have seen my penis.

16:40.959 --> 16:45.546
(<i> upbeat theme playing</i> )

16:45.546 --> 16:48.716
So, will you be comfortable

16:45.546 --> 16:48.716
seeing it 40 feet high?

16:48.716 --> 16:50.802
I'm not even comfortable having

16:48.716 --> 16:50.802
this conversation.

16:50.802 --> 16:52.261
So no.

16:52.261 --> 16:54.054
I'll just look away.

16:54.054 --> 16:55.640
But it's my only scene.

16:55.640 --> 16:57.350
You know what, Dad?

16:57.350 --> 16:59.268
We'll just worry about it

16:57.350 --> 16:59.268
when the time comes.

16:59.268 --> 17:00.728
Go for it, okay?

17:04.941 --> 17:06.526

What the...

17:17.203 --> 17:18.955
Don't worry, beautiful sister.

17:18.955 --> 17:21.499
I only say that to make Mother

17:18.955 --> 17:21.499

What are you doing? Get out.

17:36.597 --> 17:38.474
I heard you on the phone.

17:36.597 --> 17:38.474
You were spying on me?

17:38.474 --> 17:40.560
You said you would kill someone.

17:38.474 --> 17:40.560
Why would you say that?

17:40.560 --> 17:42.729
I was trying to get my mother

18:53.132 --> 18:56.176
with my sister.

18:56.176 --> 18:57.553
( door closes )

18:57.553 --> 19:00.347
I am so sorry,

18:57.553 --> 19:00.347
beautiful sister.

19:00.347 --> 19:01.766
Mother made me do it,

19:00.347 --> 19:01.766
she said...

19:01.766 --> 19:03.267
( croaks )

19:03.267 --> 19:04.727
What?

19:04.727 --> 19:06.729
( groans )

19:06.729 --> 19:08.564
What? Aah!

19:08.564 --> 19:12.777
Do you have any idea

19:08.564 --> 19:12.777
what you've put me through?

19:19.575 --> 19:21.661
( laughing )

19:23.746 --> 19:24.998
( grunts )

19:24.998 --> 19:27.041
( gasping )

19:27.041 --> 19:29.251
Why did you protect me?

19:29.251 --> 19:31.211
Because of the shares.

19:31.211 --> 19:32.505
They'd be void.

19:32.505 --> 19:35.091
Rafael signed them

19:32.505 --> 19:35.091
to you as me.

19:35.091 --> 19:37.217
Now listen closely,

19:37.217 --> 19:40.763
because you're going to jail

19:37.217 --> 19:40.763
unless you do exactly as I say.

19:40.763 --> 19:42.682
NARRATOR:

19:40.763 --> 19:42.682
<i>And friends, that's when Petra</i>

19:42.682 --> 19:45.559
<i>said the scariest thing</i>

19:42.682 --> 19:45.559
<i>Anezka ever heard.</i>

19:45.559 --> 19:47.603
First, I want you to break up

19:45.559 --> 19:47.603
with Scott.

19:49.438 --> 19:50.940
I can't.

19:50.940 --> 19:52.108
You have to.

19:52.108 --> 19:53.651
He'll suspect

19:52.108 --> 19:53.651
something.

19:53.651 --> 19:55.486
At-at-at-at...

19:55.486 --> 19:59.406
at least let me start to pull

19:55.486 --> 19:59.406
away from him first...

19:59.406 --> 20:00.908
to prepare him.

20:00.908 --> 20:02.201
( baby crying )

20:02.201 --> 20:03.828
That's Elsa.

20:03.828 --> 20:05.287
Should I...?

20:08.082 --> 20:11.251
JANE:

20:08.082 --> 20:11.251
<i>I was just so sure</i>

20:08.082 --> 20:11.251
<i>it wasn't Petra.</i>

20:11.251 --> 20:12.545
I know. Ah.

20:12.545 --> 20:13.921
Think your dad's

20:12.545 --> 20:13.921
got one of those,

20:13.921 --> 20:15.798
"I'm sorry I

20:13.921 --> 20:15.798
thought your sister

20:15.798 --> 20:17.383
was impersonating you"

20:15.798 --> 20:17.383
gift baskets?

20:17.383 --> 20:19.468
He might. I mean, it's

20:17.383 --> 20:19.468
straight out of a telenovela.

20:19.468 --> 20:21.345
NARRATOR:

20:19.468 --> 20:21.345
<i>Exactly!</i>

20:21.345 --> 20:23.347
Oh, Michael's sweatshirt,

20:21.345 --> 20:23.347
he left it at the gym.

20:23.347 --> 20:25.808
Thank you.

20:25.808 --> 20:28.435
So...

20:28.435 --> 20:29.979
What happened

20:28.435 --> 20:29.979
with you two?

20:29.979 --> 20:31.605
Let's just say...

20:31.605 --> 20:34.067
I get what you two

20:31.605 --> 20:34.067
see in each other.

20:34.067 --> 20:35.442
What does that mean?

20:35.442 --> 20:37.111
The judgey thing? What?

20:37.111 --> 20:39.197
You told me you were judgey

20:37.111 --> 20:39.197
the first week I met you.

20:39.197 --> 20:40.740
I'm allowed to say that.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.742
Well, Michael's not judgey.

20:40.740 --> 20:42.742
Oh, trust me, he is.

20:42.742 --> 20:44.618
He saw you flirting

20:42.742 --> 20:44.618
with a married woman,

20:44.618 --> 20:45.953
he's going to say something.

20:45.953 --> 20:48.706
What?

20:45.953 --> 20:48.706
What were you talking about?

20:48.706 --> 20:50.875
He was picking apart my workout.

20:48.706 --> 20:50.875
NARRATOR:<i> The gym, yes.</i>

20:50.875 --> 20:52.334
<i>Gotta get back,</i>

20:50.875 --> 20:52.334
<i>writing it down.</i>

20:52.334 --> 20:55.295
What married woman?

20:52.334 --> 20:55.295
She had a ring.

20:55.295 --> 20:58.257
You were joking about

20:55.295 --> 20:58.257
taking a shower together?

20:58.257 --> 21:00.300
With Claire? Okay, first

20:58.257 --> 21:00.300
of all, she's not married.

21:00.300 --> 21:02.136
I don't know what

21:00.300 --> 21:02.136
the ring was.

21:02.136 --> 21:03.637
But she's also a

21:02.136 --> 21:03.637
friend from college,

21:03.637 --> 21:05.305
and partners

21:03.637 --> 21:05.305
with Spencer Davis.

21:05.305 --> 21:06.849
The guy your dad

21:05.305 --> 21:06.849
insulted?

21:06.849 --> 21:09.309
Yeah, I was trying

21:06.849 --> 21:09.309
to get him an audition.

21:09.309 --> 21:11.395
MICHAEL:

21:09.309 --> 21:11.395
<i>No, I'm so sorry.</i>

21:11.395 --> 21:14.774
I feel like an ass.

21:14.774 --> 21:17.484
Yeah, okay.

21:14.774 --> 21:17.484
I love you.

21:17.484 --> 21:19.112
( phone beeps )

21:19.112 --> 21:20.404
Wow, I basically just blew up

21:20.404 --> 21:22.281
months of progress

21:20.404 --> 21:22.281
on the family front.

21:22.281 --> 21:24.658
What happened?

21:22.281 --> 21:24.658
I told Jane something

21:24.658 --> 21:26.702
I shouldn't have. Rafael's gotta

21:24.658 --> 21:26.702
hate me.

21:26.702 --> 21:28.746
I mean, I would hate me

21:26.702 --> 21:28.746
if I were him.

21:28.746 --> 21:30.456
NARRATOR:

21:28.746 --> 21:30.456
<i>It should be noted Rogelio felt</i>

21:30.456 --> 21:32.875
<i>Michael's sharing</i>

21:30.456 --> 21:32.875
<i>was a cry for help.</i>

21:32.875 --> 21:35.377
<i>Which, by the way,</i>

21:32.875 --> 21:35.377
<i>it wasn't at all.</i>

21:35.377 --> 21:39.215
<i>Nevertheless, friends,</i>

21:35.377 --> 21:39.215
<i>his wheels started turning.</i>

21:40.507 --> 21:41.884
( computer chimes )

21:44.262 --> 21:45.596
Oh, my God.

21:51.811 --> 21:53.854
NARRATOR:

21:51.811 --> 21:53.854
<i>On the one hand,</i>

21:53.854 --> 21:56.023
<i>Jane was pretty sure--</i>

21:53.854 --> 21:56.023
<i>okay, completely sure--</i>

21:56.023 --> 21:58.276
<i>that her</i> abuela<i> would</i>

21:56.023 --> 21:58.276
<i>not want her to respond.</i>

21:58.276 --> 22:02.113
<i>On the other hand,</i>

21:58.276 --> 22:02.113
<i>it's her freaking cousin!</i>

22:02.113 --> 22:04.240
<i>The girl has never had</i>

22:02.113 --> 22:04.240
<i>a cousin before!</i>

22:04.240 --> 22:05.950
<i>This is big, people!</i>

<i>Oh, my God! Jane!</i>

22:51.329 --> 22:52.955
Hi.

22:52.955 --> 22:54.248
Hi. Ha.

22:54.248 --> 22:55.541
Hey.

22:55.541 --> 22:57.459
NARRATOR:

22:55.541 --> 22:57.459
<i>Which brings us here, now.</i>

22:57.459 --> 22:59.545
( speaks Spanish ):

22:57.459 --> 22:59.545
I have to drop this off

22:57.459 --> 22:59.545
at the safe.

22:59.545 --> 23:02.006
( speaks English ):

22:59.545 --> 23:02.006
I wanted to apologize

22:59.545 --> 23:02.006
for what happened.

23:02.006 --> 23:03.381
I know it must

23:02.006 --> 23:03.381
have been awful

23:03.381 --> 23:05.301
hearing from your sister

23:03.381 --> 23:05.301
out of the blue.

23:05.301 --> 23:08.221
I should never

23:05.301 --> 23:08.221
have risked that.

23:08.221 --> 23:09.429
I'm sorry, Abuela.

23:09.429 --> 23:12.183
( speaks Spanish ):

23:09.429 --> 23:12.183
All right.

23:12.183 --> 23:15.102
( speaks English ):

23:12.183 --> 23:15.102
But wait.

23:15.102 --> 23:17.271
Last night, a cousin wrote me.

23:15.102 --> 23:17.271
( speaks Spanish ): What?

23:17.271 --> 23:20.358
( speaks English ):

23:17.271 --> 23:20.358
Her name is Catalina. She's

23:17.271 --> 23:20.358
your sister's son's daughter.

23:20.358 --> 23:21.901
Jane--

23:20.358 --> 23:21.901
I'm just telling you this

23:21.901 --> 23:23.736
so that you know. You won't

23:21.901 --> 23:23.736
hear about her again.

23:23.736 --> 23:25.863
( speaks Spanish ):

23:23.736 --> 23:25.863
I don't want you in touch

23:23.736 --> 23:25.863
with her.

23:25.863 --> 23:27.614
( speaks English ):

23:25.863 --> 23:27.614
Abuela, that's not fair.

23:27.614 --> 23:29.909
( speaks Spanish ):

23:27.614 --> 23:29.909
It will open things up.

23:29.909 --> 23:33.120
( Speaks English ):

23:29.909 --> 23:33.120
Well, maybe things

23:29.909 --> 23:33.120
should open up.

23:33.120 --> 23:34.747
( speaks Spanish ):

23:33.120 --> 23:34.747
Ah. What?

23:34.747 --> 23:37.583
I know your sister

23:34.747 --> 23:37.583
ruined your wedding,

23:37.583 --> 23:40.336
but don't you think

23:37.583 --> 23:40.336
it's time?

23:40.336 --> 23:44.631
( speaks Spanish ):

23:40.336 --> 23:44.631
She ruined much more

23:40.336 --> 23:44.631
than my wedding.

23:44.631 --> 23:46.342
She ruined my relationship

23:44.631 --> 23:46.342
with my family.

23:46.342 --> 23:49.053
My mother wouldn't talk

23:46.342 --> 23:49.053
to me afterwards.

23:49.053 --> 23:51.347
She died not speaking to me.

23:51.347 --> 23:53.431
( speak English ):

23:51.347 --> 23:53.431
What?

23:53.431 --> 23:56.685
( speaks Spanish ):

23:53.431 --> 23:56.685
You're always so sure

23:53.431 --> 23:56.685
you're right.

23:56.685 --> 24:00.689
Well, you're not.

23:56.685 --> 24:00.689
Not about this.

24:00.689 --> 24:02.691
Where's the cash pouch?

24:02.691 --> 24:04.110
( speaks English ):

24:02.691 --> 24:04.110
What?

24:04.110 --> 24:05.403
( gasps )

24:14.870 --> 24:16.663
( speaks Spanish ):

24:14.870 --> 24:16.663
I put the money down

24:16.663 --> 24:20.584
and I shouldn't have. Please

24:16.663 --> 24:20.584
take it out of my paycheck.

24:20.584 --> 24:23.170
( speaks Spanish ):

24:20.584 --> 24:23.170
Let's just see

24:20.584 --> 24:23.170
if it turns up.

24:23.170 --> 24:24.462
( gasps )

24:26.840 --> 24:31.011
( speaks English ):

24:26.840 --> 24:31.011
There are cameras everywhere.

24:26.840 --> 24:31.011
I'll fix this.

24:31.011 --> 24:32.721
ANEZKA:

24:31.011 --> 24:32.721
<i>Okay, all fixed.</i>

24:32.721 --> 24:34.598
Back to blonde.

24:34.598 --> 24:36.558
Good.

24:36.558 --> 24:38.102
Now, you've laid

24:36.558 --> 24:38.102
enough groundwork.

24:38.102 --> 24:40.813
Go break up with Scott.

24:38.102 --> 24:40.813
( cell phone ringing )

24:40.813 --> 24:42.606
Do you have $40 million

24:42.606 --> 24:44.275
to buy two-thirds

24:42.606 --> 24:44.275
of the Marbella back?

24:44.275 --> 24:45.692
No, but...

24:45.692 --> 24:48.154
Then why are you calling me?

24:45.692 --> 24:48.154
( phone beeps )

24:48.154 --> 24:50.364
And why are you

24:48.154 --> 24:50.364
still standing there?

24:50.364 --> 24:51.991
Go break up with...

24:50.364 --> 24:51.991
Scott?

24:51.991 --> 24:54.034
Look, I know things

24:51.991 --> 24:54.034
haven't been great with us,

24:54.034 --> 24:55.661
but I have to

24:54.034 --> 24:55.661
ask you a favor.

24:55.661 --> 24:57.704
( sniffles )

24:57.704 --> 24:59.999
Oh.

24:57.704 --> 24:59.999
Sorry. Sorry.

25:01.750 --> 25:03.710
Are you okay?

25:01.750 --> 25:03.710
Oh, come on!

25:03.710 --> 25:05.212
Wait, Scott...

25:05.212 --> 25:07.381
You don't have to act

25:05.212 --> 25:07.381
like you care.

25:07.381 --> 25:09.383
No, but I do.

25:09.383 --> 25:11.885
In that I don't

25:09.383 --> 25:11.885
want you to be,

25:11.885 --> 25:14.138
like,<i> extremely</i> upset.

25:14.138 --> 25:17.308
I think...

25:17.308 --> 25:19.143
I think Petra's gonna

25:17.308 --> 25:19.143
break up with me.

25:19.143 --> 25:21.854
Oh, I-I'm sure that's not true.

25:19.143 --> 25:21.854
It is.

25:21.854 --> 25:24.148
I-I don't know

25:21.854 --> 25:24.148
what happened.

25:24.148 --> 25:27.693
I-I really thought

25:24.148 --> 25:27.693
Scetra was forever.

25:27.693 --> 25:29.278
I don't know what changed.

25:29.278 --> 25:31.364
ROGELIO:

25:29.278 --> 25:31.364
<i>Changing lanes, Matelio.</i>

25:31.364 --> 25:32.948
This really isn't

25:31.364 --> 25:32.948
a good time for lunch,

25:32.948 --> 25:34.532
so maybe somewhere close?

25:34.532 --> 25:35.909
Close. Got it.

25:37.911 --> 25:39.621
Couldn't have cleaned

25:37.911 --> 25:39.621
that seat off

25:39.621 --> 25:40.831
before I got in?

25:40.831 --> 25:42.333
No, not really, no.

25:44.877 --> 25:47.629
What the hell is this?

25:47.629 --> 25:49.631
<i>I am the patriarch</i>

25:47.629 --> 25:49.631
<i>of this family,</i>

25:49.631 --> 25:51.549
so when things break down,

25:49.631 --> 25:51.549
it is my responsibility

25:51.549 --> 25:52.843
to build them

25:51.549 --> 25:52.843
back up again.

25:52.843 --> 25:54.345
It's time to

25:52.843 --> 25:54.345
hash this out,

25:54.345 --> 25:55.804
man to man.

25:55.804 --> 25:57.931
To man to man.

25:55.804 --> 25:57.931
Rogelio, we really--

25:57.931 --> 26:00.017
I really don't think--

25:57.931 --> 26:00.017
No excuses, this is happening.

26:00.017 --> 26:01.435
I really don't

26:00.017 --> 26:01.435
have time for this.

26:01.435 --> 26:03.103
We'll do it quickly.

26:01.435 --> 26:03.103
Michael,

26:03.103 --> 26:04.397
you said you messed up,

26:04.397 --> 26:06.524
and you wanted

26:04.397 --> 26:06.524
to make it better.

26:06.524 --> 26:08.150
So...

26:08.150 --> 26:11.153
Okay, um...

26:11.153 --> 26:13.697
Look, I'm sorry for

26:11.153 --> 26:13.697
jumping to conclusions

26:13.697 --> 26:16.283
and for telling Jane.

26:13.697 --> 26:16.283
<i>Running</i> to Jane.

26:16.283 --> 26:17.826
I wouldn't describe it

26:16.283 --> 26:17.826
as running.

26:17.826 --> 26:19.328
Oh, no, you ran.

26:17.826 --> 26:19.328
Okay.

26:19.328 --> 26:20.871
I'm sorry for

26:19.328 --> 26:20.871
running to Jane.

26:20.871 --> 26:23.707
Um, it wasn't cool,

26:20.871 --> 26:23.707
and I'm sorry.

26:23.707 --> 26:25.042
Well, thank you

26:23.707 --> 26:25.042
for apologizing.

26:25.042 --> 26:26.710
I just...I really thought

26:25.042 --> 26:26.710
you were sleeping

26:26.710 --> 26:28.795
with that producer woman.

26:26.710 --> 26:28.795
Well, we all make mistakes.

26:28.795 --> 26:30.214
Of course he was

26:28.795 --> 26:30.214
sleeping with her!

26:30.214 --> 26:31.673
How do you think

26:30.214 --> 26:31.673
I got the audition?

26:31.673 --> 26:33.050
Rogelio. Rogelio!

26:31.673 --> 26:33.050
Is this true?

26:33.050 --> 26:34.592
Look, it doesn't matter--

26:33.050 --> 26:34.592
I knew it.

26:34.592 --> 26:36.053
You're still the same

26:36.053 --> 26:37.555
all about the muscles...

26:36.053 --> 26:37.555
Even if I was

26:37.555 --> 26:39.473
sleeping with her,

26:37.555 --> 26:39.473
it's none of your business.

26:39.473 --> 26:41.850
I can sleep with whoever I want.

26:39.473 --> 26:41.850
Oh, I thought she was married.

26:41.850 --> 26:43.561
( phone rings )

26:41.850 --> 26:43.561
You really think I'd sleep

26:43.561 --> 26:45.354
with a married woman?

26:43.561 --> 26:45.354
Shh! It's my agent.

26:45.354 --> 26:47.314
What's the word, Barry?

26:45.354 --> 26:47.314
BARRY:<i> Just checking in,</i>

<i>It did not. Oh, shoot!</i>

<i>Can you get over there?</i>

27:00.286 --> 27:02.538
<i>You have to get over there.</i>

27:02.538 --> 27:06.083
Okay, I'm on my way.

27:02.538 --> 27:06.083
Don't worry, Barry.

Really?

27:18.929 --> 27:20.847

27:20.847 --> 27:23.892
She doesn't.

27:20.847 --> 27:23.892
( quietly ): Wow.

27:23.892 --> 27:25.769
I never deserved her.

27:23.892 --> 27:25.769
Hey!

27:25.769 --> 27:28.606
Stop. You're...great.

27:28.606 --> 27:30.899
Yeah? What's so great

was<i> Family Ties</i> reruns.

27:51.462 --> 27:53.797

You're gonna

28:04.350 --> 28:06.477
Thank you, Michael. I can't

28:04.350 --> 28:06.477
believe I got the day wrong.

28:06.477 --> 28:09.938
No...!

28:06.477 --> 28:09.938
This is not happening.

I can't go to the audition

I need to say, too.

28:36.507 --> 28:37.966
So, did you

No...

28:39.552 --> 28:41.761
We got engaged!

What?

28:41.761 --> 28:43.847
I know! I was surprised, too.

Everyone was.

Yes.

Yes! Ha.

No, no, you--

You can't marry Scott.

28:58.237 --> 29:00.614
I know.

29:00.614 --> 29:04.034
I just wanted,

truly happy.

29:12.459 --> 29:14.753
Okay, I'll break up with him

29:12.459 --> 29:14.753
myself. Give me the ring.

29:14.753 --> 29:17.381
It's the silver ring.

29:14.753 --> 29:17.381
I know what a lug nut is.

29:17.381 --> 29:19.633
Sure you lifted the jack high?

29:17.381 --> 29:19.633
Yes.

29:19.633 --> 29:21.968
That could be the problem.

29:19.633 --> 29:21.968
I know how to change a tire.

29:21.968 --> 29:23.970
If you knew, you wouldn't

be having so much trouble

"Marrying"?

29:25.431 --> 29:27.182
That was an accident.

29:27.182 --> 29:29.226
Seriously? She is not married.

29:27.182 --> 29:29.226
I didn't mean that.

Let it go.

Well, Jane was engaged.

We were engaged.

31:57.541 --> 31:59.000
of the lounge,

31:59.000 --> 32:00.419
I know all the

31:59.000 --> 32:00.419
high rollers.

32:00.419 --> 32:01.961
Now, there's

32:00.419 --> 32:01.961
this French guy,

32:01.961 --> 32:04.172
super skeezy, super rich,

32:01.961 --> 32:04.172
comes here once a month,

32:04.172 --> 32:06.383
he wants to invest in beachside

32:04.172 --> 32:06.383
real estate.

32:06.383 --> 32:08.510
I mean, he'll probably flip it

32:06.383 --> 32:08.510
again, but who cares?

32:08.510 --> 32:10.262
Wow.

32:08.510 --> 32:10.262
Right?

32:10.262 --> 32:11.805
Yeah.

32:10.262 --> 32:11.805
I'm sorry, though,

32:11.805 --> 32:13.932
you were saying?

32:11.805 --> 32:13.932
Uh, it can wait.

32:13.932 --> 32:17.269
Would you mind introducing me

32:13.932 --> 32:17.269
to this Frenchman...

32:17.269 --> 32:18.645
babe?

32:18.645 --> 32:20.230
Oh, my pleasure.

32:20.856 --> 32:22.357
But first...

32:22.357 --> 32:23.609
how about a little kiss.

32:23.609 --> 32:24.902
Oh.

32:24.902 --> 32:26.236
Come here, you.

32:24.902 --> 32:26.236
( gasps )

32:35.161 --> 32:37.497
Uh, I had to pull a Magic Mike

32:37.497 --> 32:39.666
and rip off your shirt

32:37.497 --> 32:39.666

These are for you.

33:48.735 --> 33:50.779
Thank you.

33:48.735 --> 33:50.779
Mm-hmm.

are you giving it up?

What?

34:06.085 --> 34:09.088

There's no way he's

37:03.221 --> 37:05.849
He'll probably dump it right

in Palm Beach.

37:11.730 --> 37:13.773
Here's the thing...Scott.

37:15.150 --> 37:17.402
I can't marry you.

37:17.402 --> 37:18.778
What?

37:19.946 --> 37:21.531
Why?

37:21.531 --> 37:23.616
I've been married twice...

37:23.616 --> 37:27.245
and seeing this ring

37:23.616 --> 37:27.245
on my finger, it...

37:27.245 --> 37:30.540
made me realize I need to be

37:27.245 --> 37:30.540
on my own for a while.

37:30.540 --> 37:32.125
It's me.

37:32.125 --> 37:33.459
It's not.

37:33.459 --> 37:34.669
You've been a...

true surprise.

37:37.839 --> 37:40.592
No, this is about me.

37:47.807 --> 37:50.018

woman I've ever been with.

37:57.400 --> 37:59.444
Stop.

37:57.400 --> 37:59.444
No, I mean it.

37:59.444 --> 38:00.904
You came from nowhere,

38:00.904 --> 38:03.531
and you've made yourself

38:00.904 --> 38:03.531
into this...

38:03.531 --> 38:04.991
total badass.

38:04.991 --> 38:06.785
Anyway, I...

38:04.991 --> 38:06.785
I won't argue.

38:06.785 --> 38:09.621
I mean, if you're willing to

38:06.785 --> 38:09.621
walk away from this hotel,

38:09.621 --> 38:12.290
which is all your blood,

38:09.621 --> 38:12.290
sweat and tears,

38:12.290 --> 38:16.086
well, then you can walk

38:12.290 --> 38:16.086
away from anything.

38:16.086 --> 38:18.671
( chuckles ):

38:16.086 --> 38:18.671

38:30.642 --> 38:33.394

38:30.642 --> 38:33.394

38:33.394 --> 38:35.188
( speaks English ):

38:33.394 --> 38:35.188
I know.

38:35.188 --> 38:37.274
But I'm still gonna do it.

38:37.274 --> 38:39.484
Look, I've always

38:37.274 --> 38:39.484
wanted to please you.

38:39.484 --> 38:40.944
It's always been

38:39.484 --> 38:40.944
so important to me.

38:40.944 --> 38:42.487
( speaks Spanish ):

38:40.944 --> 38:42.487
And it's not anymore?

38:42.487 --> 38:44.072

38:42.487 --> 38:44.072
No, of course it is.

38:44.072 --> 38:46.616
( speaks Spanish ):

38:44.072 --> 38:46.616
Then why are you doing this?

38:46.616 --> 38:49.828
( speaks English ):

38:46.616 --> 38:49.828
Because...this is

38:46.616 --> 38:49.828
important to me, too.

38:49.828 --> 38:52.956
A-And I'm not always

38:49.828 --> 38:52.956
gonna agree with you.

38:52.956 --> 38:55.875
I-I can't always

38:52.956 --> 38:55.875
agree with you.

38:55.875 --> 38:58.377
( exhales )

39:01.589 --> 39:04.634
( takes deep breath ):

39:01.589 --> 39:04.634
Okay.

39:04.634 --> 39:05.969
( speaks Spanish ):

39:04.634 --> 39:05.969
It's fine.

39:08.221 --> 39:11.099
JANE:<i> </i>

39:08.221 --> 39:11.099
<i>I'll just keep it separate</i>

39:08.221 --> 39:11.099
<i>from my grandma.</i>

39:11.099 --> 39:12.976
We'll get past this.

39:12.976 --> 39:14.602
And then you'll reach out

39:12.976 --> 39:14.602
to Catalina?

39:14.602 --> 39:16.395
( sighs )

39:14.602 --> 39:16.395
Jane! Hi!

39:16.395 --> 39:19.191
NARRATOR:

39:16.395 --> 39:19.191
<i>Well, she won't</i>

39:16.395 --> 39:19.191
<i>have to reach far.</i>

39:19.191 --> 39:22.027
( laughs )

39:19.191 --> 39:22.027
U-Uh, oh, my God.

39:22.027 --> 39:23.862
What are you...

39:22.027 --> 39:23.862
doing here?

39:23.862 --> 39:26.072
It's such a long story.

39:26.072 --> 39:29.034
<i>Agreed.</i>

39:26.072 --> 39:29.034
<i>And we're not there yet.</i>

39:29.034 --> 39:30.535
<i>We're here.</i>

39:30.535 --> 39:32.287
Full frontal nudity?

39:33.412 --> 39:35.832
Oh, dear. You'll see

39:33.412 --> 39:35.832
in your contract

39:35.832 --> 39:38.251
you did agree to the

39:35.832 --> 39:38.251
Telemasivo morality clause,

39:38.251 --> 39:41.129
and as such, all nudity

39:38.251 --> 39:41.129
in television and film

39:41.129 --> 39:44.007
is not permitted,

39:41.129 --> 39:44.007
as it tarnishes our brand.

39:44.007 --> 39:46.551
So what are you saying,

39:44.007 --> 39:46.551
I can't take the part?

39:46.551 --> 39:47.886
She didn't say that.

39:47.886 --> 39:50.305
I didn't say that.

39:47.886 --> 39:50.305
It's at our discretion.

39:50.305 --> 39:51.764
So you<i> can</i> do it--

39:51.764 --> 39:54.767
if you do something

39:51.764 --> 39:54.767
for us in exchange.

39:54.767 --> 39:58.646
<i>Uh-oh. I wonder</i>

39:54.767 --> 39:58.646
<i>what that's all about.</i>

39:58.646 --> 39:59.981
<i>And speaking of payback.</i>

39:59.981 --> 40:02.859
Thank you

39:59.981 --> 40:02.859
for not sending me away.

40:02.859 --> 40:04.736
My children are bonded to you.

40:04.736 --> 40:07.113
It's the only reason

40:04.736 --> 40:07.113
I'm allowing you to stay.

40:07.113 --> 40:08.781
Do it.

40:08.781 --> 40:10.325
( whimpers )

40:10.325 --> 40:13.912
( mechanical buzzing )

40:10.325 --> 40:13.912
( Anezka shrieking, crying )

40:13.912 --> 40:15.955
( buzzing stops )

40:16.915 --> 40:18.666
Perfect.

40:18.666 --> 40:20.752
( faint whimpering )

40:21.586 --> 40:22.962
( crying )

40:22.962 --> 40:25.131
Oh, stop it. You'll cut bangs.

40:25.131 --> 40:27.425
PETRA:

40:25.131 --> 40:27.425
<i>So, I've had a change of heart.</i>

40:27.425 --> 40:30.220
I'm not walking away

40:27.425 --> 40:30.220
from this hotel.

40:31.637 --> 40:33.598
You are.

40:31.637 --> 40:33.598
What?

40:33.598 --> 40:35.516
I'm going to stay here

40:33.598 --> 40:35.516
and run it with my...

40:35.516 --> 40:37.352
two-thirds majority.

40:35.516 --> 40:37.352
And you're going to sell

40:37.352 --> 40:39.312
your sister's last third

40:37.352 --> 40:39.312
to a bidder of my choice.

40:39.312 --> 40:40.646
And what if I don't?

40:40.646 --> 40:42.232
Then I'll make

40:40.646 --> 40:42.232
every minute of your life

40:42.232 --> 40:43.942
a living hell.

40:43.942 --> 40:45.735
Why are you doing this?

40:45.735 --> 40:48.613
I'm only going

40:45.735 --> 40:48.613
to say this once,

40:48.613 --> 40:50.990
and if you repeat it,

40:48.613 --> 40:50.990
I'll deny it.

40:53.910 --> 40:55.995
You were right.

40:55.995 --> 40:57.914
It wasn't me.

40:57.914 --> 40:59.124
And I heard

40:59.124 --> 41:01.000
everything.

41:01.000 --> 41:03.378
Every...single...

41:03.378 --> 41:04.796
( Elsa crying )

41:04.796 --> 41:06.672
Oh...

41:06.672 --> 41:09.175
Could I say something?

41:09.175 --> 41:10.343
It's just...

41:10.343 --> 41:13.096
awesome watching you

41:10.343 --> 41:13.096
with the babies.

41:13.096 --> 41:14.431
Oh, thanks.

41:14.431 --> 41:16.224
I'm serious. For a second there,

41:16.224 --> 41:18.517
I thought

41:16.224 --> 41:18.517
you were missing the "Mom Gene."

41:18.517 --> 41:20.478
( whispers ):

41:18.517 --> 41:20.478
...thing.

41:22.480 --> 41:23.815
So I'm not leaving.

41:23.815 --> 41:25.858
You are.

41:25.858 --> 41:27.277
Oh, what?

41:27.277 --> 41:29.028
I tried nice.

41:29.028 --> 41:33.199
And I was freaking paralyzed,

41:29.028 --> 41:33.199
and nobody even noticed.

41:34.659 --> 41:36.328
So I am done...

41:36.328 --> 41:37.996
with nice.

41:40.332 --> 41:42.792
NARRATOR:

41:40.332 --> 41:42.792
<i>Get ready, friends.</i>

41:42.792 --> 41:45.337
<i>The bitch is back.</i>

41:50.633 --> 41:52.051
(<i> dramatic theme playing</i> )
