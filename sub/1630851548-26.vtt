08:37.133 --> 08:40.533
NOT A PARTISAN MOMENT, BUT IN

08:40.600 --> 08:41.833

08:41.900 --> 08:42.933
RESPONSIBILITY NOT TO GO ALONG

08:43.000 --> 08:45.000
WITH THE FLOW BECAUSE THREE DAYS

08:45.066 --> 08:47.300

09:31.400 --> 09:33.300

09:33.366 --> 09:34.133
NEVER BE MILITARY SOLUTIONS BY

09:34.200 --> 09:36.566
THE UNITED STATES.

09:36.633 --> 09:38.433
IF THE PRESIDENT WAS RIGHT,

09:38.500 --> 09:40.500
WITHDRAWING OUR TROOPS,

09:40.566 --> 09:41.100
ABSOLUTELY CORRECT.

09:41.166 --> 09:43.333
HAD WE STAYED THERE FOR THE NEXT

09:43.400 --> 09:45.866
FIVE, TEN, 20 YEARS, WE WOULD

09:45.933 --> 09:48.266
PROBABLY BE IN WORSE SHAPE.

09:48.333 --> 09:49.300
THERE IS NO MILITARY SOLUTION

09:49.366 --> 09:51.133

09:51.200 --> 09:51.900
ALWAYS ON THE TABLE AS IT

09:51.966 --> 09:54.866
RELATES TO THE USE OF FORCE.

SECONDLY, WE CAN'T GO AROUND THE

09:56.933 --> 09:57.866

10:03.566 --> 10:04.666

10:04.733 --> 10:06.066
HAVE BEEN USED FOR

10:06.133 --> 10:08.400

10:08.466 --> 10:09.933

10:17.733 --> 10:19.533
DESERVE.

10:19.600 --> 10:21.066
THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE DON'T HAVE

10:21.133 --> 10:22.266

10:22.333 --> 10:23.733
MEASURES AND BRING TERRORISTS TO

WORLD.

10:25.700 --> 10:26.700

10:26.766 --> 10:29.333

10:29.400 --> 10:30.700
OF OUR NATIONAL SECURITY

10:39.500 --> 10:40.966
STRATEGIES WE CAN USE AND WE

10:41.033 --> 10:43.433
NEED TO REBALANCE AND REIMAGINE

FOR THE FUTURE.

17:29.833 --> 17:31.300
WE CAN'T USE THE BULLY PULPIT,

17:31.366 --> 17:33.133
HAS IT EVER BEEN MENTIONED?

17:33.200 --> 17:35.533
I NEVER HEAR ANYONE TALK ABOUT

17:35.600 --> 17:35.933
IT.

17:36.000 --> 17:37.400
>> BARACK OBAMA WAS CRITICIZED

17:37.466 --> 17:38.666
FOR BEING FITNESS OBSESSED,

17:38.733 --> 17:40.300
SETTING A GOOD EXAMPLE FROM THE

17:40.366 --> 17:41.433
TOP, MICHELLE OBAMA WAS

17:41.500 --> 17:43.733
CRITICIZED FOR HER GARDEN.

17:43.800 --> 17:47.333
>> Bill: CRITICIZED, SO SHE WE

17:47.400 --> 17:52.933
SHOULD SHRINK FROM THAT?

17:53.000 --> 17:55.166
>> I'M WITH YOU, IT DOESN'T STOP

17:55.233 --> 17:56.333
ANYONE WANTS TO PROTECT OUR

17:56.400 --> 17:57.900
FAMILIES WHO DON'T FIT INTO

17:57.966 --> 17:59.733
THOSE CATEGORIES.

17:59.800 --> 18:00.266
THIS VIRUS DOES NOT KNOW

18:00.333 --> 18:04.233
PEOPLE'S PERSONAL HABITS.

18:04.300 --> 18:06.700
>> Bill: NO, BUT IT KNOWS

18:06.766 --> 18:10.233
THIS, IT KNOWS THIS.

18:10.300 --> 18:12.466
FOUR FIFTHS IS KIND OF A BIG

18:12.533 --> 18:14.666
NUMBER FOR ONE FACTOR.

18:14.733 --> 18:16.433
>> THE MOST EFFICIENT THING

18:16.500 --> 18:18.000
GOVERNMENT DOES IS DISSEMINATE

18:18.066 --> 18:18.633
PUBLIC HEALTH INFORMATION ABOUT

18:18.700 --> 18:20.733
CHOLESTEROL OR SMOKING -- 50

18:20.800 --> 18:23.433
YEARS AGO, ABOUT HALF OF

18:23.500 --> 18:24.800
AMERICAN ADULTS WOKE UP IN THE

18:24.866 --> 18:27.433
MORNING AND LIT A CIGARETTE, WE

18:27.500 --> 18:30.366
CUT THAT IN HALF.

18:30.433 --> 18:32.300
AN ENORMOUS AMOUNT OF OUR

18:32.366 --> 18:33.866
HEALTH CARE GOALS WHICH IS ABOUT

18:33.933 --> 18:37.833
18% GDP IS ABOUT KNOWN RISKY

18:37.900 --> 18:39.866
BEHAVIOR, VIOLENCE, VEHICULAR

18:39.933 --> 18:41.233
ACCIDENTS, CORONARY HEART

18:41.300 --> 18:42.666
DISEASE, LUNG DISEASE,

18:42.733 --> 18:42.933
ET CETERA.

18:43.000 --> 18:43.933
>> Bill: AND THE FOOD, THE BIG

18:44.000 --> 18:47.033
ONE IS FOOD.

18:47.100 --> 18:48.633
THAT DWARFS THE OTHER ONES, IT'S

18:48.700 --> 18:50.633
THE ONE WE ARE NOT ALLOWED TO

18:50.700 --> 18:50.866
MENTION.

18:50.933 --> 18:53.433
THAT HAS GOT TO CHANGE.

18:53.500 --> 18:56.266
LISTEN, THIS IS OUR LAST SHOW WE

18:56.333 --> 18:57.200
HAVE BEFORE THIS RECALL ELECTION

18:57.266 --> 18:58.766
COMING UP SO I WANT TO ASK ABOUT

18:58.833 --> 19:01.000
THIS QUESTION, BECAUSE IT SEEMS

19:01.066 --> 19:02.066
LIKE THE REPUBLICANS WANT TO

19:02.133 --> 19:04.000
REPUBLICANS WANT GAVIN NEWSOM TO

19:04.066 --> 19:04.633
RESIGN FOR THE CRIME OF BEATING

19:04.700 --> 19:09.300
THEM IN THE ELECTION.

19:09.366 --> 19:09.566
[LAUGHTER]

19:09.633 --> 19:10.200
I'M VERY CONCERNED ABOUT THE

19:10.266 --> 19:12.633
GENERAL TREND IN AMERICA WHERE

19:12.700 --> 19:13.433
ELECTIONS DON'T COUNT IF IT

19:13.500 --> 19:14.600
DOESN'T COME OUT THE WAY YOU

19:14.666 --> 19:18.466
WANTED THEM TO GO.

19:18.533 --> 19:20.766
I ALSO THINK READING AS I HAVE

19:20.833 --> 19:23.866
THIS WEEK A LOT OF PEOPLE

19:23.933 --> 19:25.400
TALKING ABOUT A FAILED BIDEN

19:25.466 --> 19:27.833
PRESIDENCY, AFTER NINE YEARS --

19:27.900 --> 19:29.533
NINE MONTHS -- NINE YEARS, CAN

19:29.600 --> 19:29.833
YOU IMAGINE?

19:29.900 --> 19:35.633
THAT WOULD BE TRUMP.

19:35.700 --> 19:37.266
CAN YOU GIVE A GUY A CHANCE?

19:37.333 --> 19:39.133
IT SEEMS LIKE NO ONE WANTS TO

19:39.200 --> 19:41.566
SOLVE A PROBLEM, THEY JUST WANT

19:41.633 --> 19:42.700
TO BLAME PEOPLE WHO HAVEN'T

19:42.766 --> 19:44.733
IMMEDIATELY SOLVED THE PROBLEM.

19:44.800 --> 19:49.700
[APPLAUSE]

19:49.766 --> 19:51.933
AND THIS IS NOT A WAY A

19:52.000 --> 19:53.700
GOVERNMENT CAN FUNCTION OR BE

19:53.766 --> 19:54.033
STABLE.

19:54.100 --> 19:57.033
>> IT'S AN INSTANT GRATIFICATION

19:57.100 --> 19:57.266
PROBLEM.

19:57.333 --> 19:59.633
BUT THEY ALSO BOTH WENT FROM

19:59.700 --> 20:00.466
PRETTY PEAK HIGH IS.

20:00.533 --> 20:02.533
GAVIN NEWSOM CAME IN, HUGE WIN

20:02.600 --> 20:03.800
IN THE ELECTION, WAS PRETTY

20:03.866 --> 20:06.933
POPULAR AT THE BEGINNING OF

20:07.000 --> 20:08.600
CORONAVIRUS, I VIEW THAT TRICKLE

20:08.666 --> 20:09.500
THINGS AS SEPARATE ALTHOUGH IT'S

20:09.566 --> 20:11.666
INTERESTING THE PRESIDENT IS

20:11.733 --> 20:13.566
CAMPAIGNING FOR NEWSOM IN THE

20:13.633 --> 20:15.133
11TH HOUR, CLEARLY THEY THINK

20:15.200 --> 20:16.133
HE'S POPULAR ENOUGH THAT'S GOING

20:16.200 --> 20:17.366
TO HELP HERE.

20:17.433 --> 20:18.366
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE HYPOCRISY AND

20:18.433 --> 20:21.166
THAT IS WHERE SOME OF THIS

20:21.233 --> 20:21.833
STARTED AGAINST NEWSOM.

20:21.900 --> 20:23.866
I'M VOTING NO ON THE RECALL, I

20:23.933 --> 20:24.866
THINK HE'S A FINE GOVERNOR AND I

20:24.933 --> 20:27.500
WOULD LIKE TO SEE HIM STAY AND I

20:27.566 --> 20:29.200
ALSO THINK WHEN YOU GOVERN THIS

20:29.266 --> 20:29.400
WAY --

20:29.466 --> 20:31.766
[APPLAUSE]

20:31.833 --> 20:36.633
ITS CONSTANT CHANGE, CALIFORNIA

20:36.700 --> 20:39.866
HAS AN ABILITY TO HAVE A RECALL,

20:39.933 --> 20:41.633
WE ALSO HAVE AN ABILITY TO PUT

20:41.700 --> 20:43.666
SO MANY PROPOSITIONS ON THE

20:43.733 --> 20:44.800
BALLOT FAIRLY EASILY WHICH

20:44.866 --> 20:48.333
COMPLETELY CHANGE LAWS VERY

20:48.400 --> 20:48.733
QUICKLY.

20:48.800 --> 20:50.166
IT'S ONE OF THE WAYS IN

20:50.233 --> 20:51.066
CALIFORNIA, IF EVERY STATE HAD

20:51.133 --> 20:53.600
THIS I BET YOU WOULD SEE A LOT

20:53.666 --> 20:54.466
MORE RECALLS.

20:54.533 --> 20:55.866
>> Bill: WHAT DO YOU THINK?

20:55.933 --> 20:57.866
>> I'M AGAINST RECALLS COME ON

20:57.933 --> 21:02.600
AGAINST INITIATIVES, I'M AGAINST

21:02.666 --> 21:05.333
REFERENDA.

21:05.400 --> 21:06.800
THIS IS APPLIED TO POPULISM

21:06.866 --> 21:08.866
WHICH IS THE BELIEF THAT THE

21:08.933 --> 21:10.133
PUBLIC PASSIONS ARE SELF

21:10.200 --> 21:10.733
GRATIFYING AND THEY SHOULD BE

21:10.800 --> 21:13.766
TRANSLATED IMMEDIATELY AND

21:13.833 --> 21:17.800
DIRECTLY INTO POLICY AND

21:17.866 --> 21:19.566
INSTITUTIONS.

21:19.633 --> 21:22.266
THE PRINCIPLE OF REPRESENTATION

21:22.333 --> 21:23.600
WHICH IS THE ESSENCE OF OUR

21:23.666 --> 21:24.900
REPUBLIC, IS THAT PEOPLE DON'T

21:24.966 --> 21:26.700
DECIDE ISSUES, THEY DECIDE WHO

21:26.766 --> 21:28.466
WILL DECIDE, YOU CAN'T IN THE

21:28.533 --> 21:29.900
CASE OF A RECALL SIMPLY DECLARE

21:29.966 --> 21:30.533
A MULLIGAN BECAUSE YOU DON'T

21:30.600 --> 21:31.700
LIKE THE SHOT YOU TOOK.

21:31.766 --> 21:33.800
[APPLAUSE]

21:33.866 --> 21:36.900
>> Bill: EVEN IF YOU DON'T

21:36.966 --> 21:37.466
LIKE GOVERNOR NEWSOM OR HIS

21:37.533 --> 21:39.466
POLICIES YOU WOULD SAY HE SHOULD

21:39.533 --> 21:40.600
STAY BECAUSE YOU'RE A MAN OF

21:40.666 --> 21:41.233
PRINCIPLE.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.966
>> I THINK PEOPLE DESERVE TO

21:43.033 --> 21:45.700
SUFFER THE CHOICE THEY MADE, YE

21:45.766 --> 21:46.433
YES.

21:46.500 --> 21:46.700
[LAUGHTER]

21:46.766 --> 21:46.966
[APPLAUSE]

21:47.033 --> 21:48.733
>> THAT'S THE POINT OF AN

21:48.800 --> 21:49.800
ELECTION ON A SCHEDULE, YOU CAN

21:49.866 --> 21:51.800
CAST JUDGMENT ON THAT PERSON IN

21:51.866 --> 21:52.233
THE NEXT ELECTION.

21:52.300 --> 21:55.433
>> Bill: HOPEFULLY WE CAN

21:55.500 --> 21:56.866
RECALL THE RECALL LAW, THAT

21:56.933 --> 22:03.233
WOULD BE SO CALIFORNIA.

22:03.300 --> 22:03.500
[LAUGHTER]

22:03.566 --> 22:04.933
LET ME ASK ABOUT TEXAS, WHAT'S

22:05.000 --> 22:09.833
GOING ON IN TEXAS, THIS IS WOW.

22:09.900 --> 22:11.033
INTERESTING STUFF, INTERESTING

22:11.100 --> 22:11.633
THAT THE SUPREME COURT ALREADY

22:11.700 --> 22:13.933
BASICALLY HEARD IT.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.633
I HEARD THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT,

22:16.700 --> 22:18.266
BIDEN'S DEPARTMENT IS GOING TO

22:18.333 --> 22:19.500
SUE TEXAS AND WHAT, TO GET ALL

22:19.566 --> 22:22.866
WAY TO THE SUPREME COURT?

22:22.933 --> 22:25.066
WAIT, WE DID THAT IN THE

22:25.133 --> 22:29.433
SUPREME COURT SAID TEXAS, YOU DO

22:29.500 --> 22:30.600
YOU.

22:30.666 --> 22:32.800
I'M WONDERING IF THIS COULD

22:32.866 --> 22:33.033
BACKFIRE.

22:33.100 --> 22:34.066
REPUBLICANS ALWAYS SEEM TO BE

22:34.133 --> 22:36.533
HAPPIER WHEN THEY ARE OUT OF

22:36.600 --> 22:37.633
OFFICE BECAUSE THEY JUST ARE SO

22:37.700 --> 22:41.033
GOOD AT THE BITCHING, AND THEY

22:41.100 --> 22:45.733
LOVE TO OWN THE LIBERALS AND

22:45.800 --> 22:47.200
COMPLAIN, WHEN THEY GET INTO

22:47.266 --> 22:48.633
OFFICE, AND GET TO ENACT SOME

22:48.700 --> 22:51.966
OTHER IDEAS, THEY SCARE THE SHIT

22:52.033 --> 22:53.300
OUT OF PEOPLE.

22:53.366 --> 22:54.500
ELECTIONS ARE WON ON FEAR A LOT

22:54.566 --> 22:55.400
OF THE TIME, THAT'S HOW TRUMP

22:55.466 --> 22:57.566
GOT IN, THE FEAR OF THE

22:57.633 --> 22:58.733
OVERREACHING OF THE LIBERALS AND

22:58.800 --> 23:00.733
SO FORTH.

23:00.800 --> 23:02.533
I'M WONDERING IF THIS COULD

23:02.600 --> 23:03.000
REALLY HELP -- I THINK

23:03.066 --> 23:05.200
GOVERNOR ABBOTT IS HELPING GAVIN

23:05.266 --> 23:06.666
NEWSOM COME I THINK PEOPLE ARE

23:06.733 --> 23:08.000
GOING TO LOOK AT THAT AND GO

23:08.066 --> 23:10.300
"OH, MY GOD, WE DON'T WANT A

23:10.366 --> 23:11.400
REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR HERE IN THIS

23:11.466 --> 23:13.133
STATE IF THAT'S WHAT A

23:13.200 --> 23:15.533
REPUBLICAN GOVERNOR MIGHT DO."

23:15.600 --> 23:19.066
[APPLAUSE]

23:19.133 --> 23:20.800
DO YOU THINK THAT'S POSSIBLE?

23:20.866 --> 23:22.733
>> IT'S DEFINITELY POSSIBLE, IN

23:22.800 --> 23:25.333
MY LIFETIME, IN MY CAREER

23:25.400 --> 23:26.700
COVERING POLITICS SO MANY PEOPLE

23:26.766 --> 23:27.933
WOULD TALK ABOUT THIS CONCEPT

23:28.000 --> 23:29.866
THAT IF ROE V. WADE WAS EVER

23:29.933 --> 23:31.766
OVERTURNED, IF WOMEN WOULD TAKE

23:31.833 --> 23:34.733
TO THE STREETS, THAT WOULD END

23:34.800 --> 23:36.500
EVERYTHING, YOU WOULD HAVE A

23:36.566 --> 23:37.733
PERMANENT DEMOCRATIC MAJORITY.

23:37.800 --> 23:38.633
THIS HAS BEEN SLOWLY HAPPENING

23:38.700 --> 23:40.900
FOR A VERY LONG TIME, PEOPLE

23:40.966 --> 23:45.666
HAVE BEEN CHALLENGING, TRYING TO

23:45.733 --> 23:49.133
GET THINGS TO THE COURT -- WHAT

23:49.200 --> 23:53.733
TRUMP DID TO THE JUDICIARY --

23:53.800 --> 23:55.033
>> Bill: DID, MEANING?

23:55.100 --> 23:57.300
>> MITCH McCONNELL AND TRUMP,

23:57.366 --> 23:58.500
COMPLETELY CHANGING THE

23:58.566 --> 24:00.633
JUDICIARY, JUSTICES WHO WOULD BE

24:00.700 --> 24:03.800
IN FAVOR OF THINGS THAT ARE

24:03.866 --> 24:05.500
HAPPENING IN TEXAS, I CAN GO

24:05.566 --> 24:06.500
INTO THE MERITS OF THAT IF

24:06.566 --> 24:10.100
THAT'S THE DEBATE YOU WANT TO

24:10.166 --> 24:10.300
HAVE.

24:10.366 --> 24:11.900
PARTICULARLY IN TEXAS WHERE THEY

24:11.966 --> 24:12.900
ARE TRYING TO RESTRICT VOTING

24:12.966 --> 24:14.700
RIGHTS BUT THEY ARE ALSO FORCING

24:14.766 --> 24:16.533
SPORTS TEAMS TO HAVE THE

24:16.600 --> 24:17.366
NATIONAL ANTHEM AT EVERY SINGLE

24:17.433 --> 24:18.600
GAME IN TEXAS.

24:18.666 --> 24:19.766
YOU'RE NOT ALLOWED TO DO

24:19.833 --> 24:22.633
SOMETHING WITH YOUR OWN BODY, IT

24:22.700 --> 24:23.333
IS DANGEROUS AND REALLY ALARMING

24:23.400 --> 24:28.733
FOR ANY PERSON.

24:28.800 --> 24:34.266
[APPLAUSE]

24:34.333 --> 24:37.300
>> THE TEXAS LAW IS A SHORT

24:37.366 --> 24:40.266
LIVED SIDESHOW, AS SOON AS IT'S

24:40.333 --> 24:43.033
ENFORCED BY ONE OF THESE PRIVATE

24:43.100 --> 24:44.966
ATTORNEY GENERAL'S, IT WILL BE

24:45.033 --> 24:46.566
STRUCK DOWN SUMMARILY, THE BIG

24:46.633 --> 24:48.833
SHOW WILL BE COMING THIS FALL,

24:48.900 --> 24:50.066
ORAL ARGUMENTS IN A MISSISSIPPI

24:50.133 --> 24:51.800
CASE WITH THE COURT IS BEING

24:51.866 --> 24:53.866
ASKED EXPLICITLY TO OVERTURN

24:53.933 --> 24:55.400
ROE V. WADE.

24:55.466 --> 24:58.466
BY JUNE OF 2022, OFF YEAR

24:58.533 --> 24:59.033
ELECTIONS, THERE WILL BE AN

24:59.100 --> 25:00.833
ANSWER TO THAT.

25:00.900 --> 25:03.333
I DON'T THINK WE'VE EVER HAD AN

25:03.400 --> 25:03.933
ELECTION TURN ON AN ABORTION

25:04.000 --> 25:06.066
ISSUE COME I DON'T LIKE WE EVER

25:06.133 --> 25:06.600
WILL.

25:06.666 --> 25:08.133
>> Bill: REALLY?

25:08.200 --> 25:09.700
I FEEL LIKE THE OPPOSITE, I FEEL

25:09.766 --> 25:10.433
LIKE ABORTION IS THAT ISSUE THAT

25:10.500 --> 25:14.733
IS ALWAYS THERE AND A VERY

25:14.800 --> 25:17.333
SIZABLE PART OF THE POPULATION

25:17.400 --> 25:20.666
VOTES PRETTY MUCH JUST ON THAT.

25:20.733 --> 25:22.466
IT CROSSES PARTY LINES, BY THE

25:22.533 --> 25:22.633
WAY.

25:22.700 --> 25:25.633
>> MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE

25:25.700 --> 25:26.833
SINGLE-ISSUE VOTERS ON THAT ARE

25:26.900 --> 25:29.033
ON THE PRO-LIFE SIDE.

25:29.100 --> 25:30.866
>> Bill: RIGHT, BUT THE

25:30.933 --> 25:32.766
DEMOCRATS DEPEND A LOT ON THE

25:32.833 --> 25:36.900
LATINO VOTE, THERE'S A LOT OF --

25:36.966 --> 25:39.033
CHRISTIANS OF ALL STRIPES

25:39.100 --> 25:39.700
SOMETIMES.

25:39.766 --> 25:41.100
>> AND TEXAS DEMOCRATS ARE

25:41.166 --> 25:43.033
HOPING THIS IS EXACTLY WHAT WILL

25:43.100 --> 25:44.866
HAPPEN, GALVANIZE EVERYONE,

25:44.933 --> 25:45.900
MONEY, RESOURCES, GETTING PEOPLE

25:45.966 --> 25:48.033

BEAR WEIRD AND PROUD.

27:49.566 --> 27:53.133
I LOVE IT.

27:53.200 --> 27:56.600
I FEEL LIKE THE BATTLEGROUND FOR

27:56.666 --> 27:57.300
THE NEXT ELECTIONS ARE MOVING

27:57.366 --> 28:00.200
INTO THE SCHOOL ROOM.

28:00.266 --> 28:02.766
UNIVERSITIES, BUT ESPECIALLY

28:02.833 --> 28:06.466
SCHOOLS, GRAMMAR SCHOOLS, HIGH

28:06.533 --> 28:09.566
SCHOOLS, A PROFESSOR BECAME THE

28:09.633 --> 28:10.666
LATEST TEACHER AND PROFESSOR TO

28:10.733 --> 28:14.033
RESIGN THIS WEEK BECAUSE OF

28:14.100 --> 28:15.033
WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE SCHOOLS

28:15.100 --> 28:16.400
AND I'VE BEEN TALKING ABOUT THIS

28:16.466 --> 28:18.900
FOR A COUPLE OF YEARS.

28:18.966 --> 28:20.433
AT FIRST PEOPLE ARE DOING WHAT

28:20.500 --> 28:21.166
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT?

28:21.233 --> 28:23.066
IF YOU DIDN'T HAVE KIDS AND A

28:23.133 --> 28:24.533
LOT OF TIMES KIDS COME HOME FROM

28:24.600 --> 28:25.400
SCHOOL, THEY DIDN'T TELL PARENTS

28:25.466 --> 28:27.033
WHAT THEY ARE BEING TOLD IN

28:27.100 --> 28:28.433
SCHOOL -- PEOPLE DIDN'T KNOW.

28:28.500 --> 28:33.700
NOW IT'S MUCH MORE OF AN ISSUE.

28:33.766 --> 28:34.033
WHO VOTES?

28:34.100 --> 28:35.300
PARENTS VOTE.

28:35.366 --> 28:37.166
FOR YOUNG PEOPLE HAVE PARTIES TO

28:37.233 --> 28:38.166
GO TO, YOU'RE SINGLE, YOU DON'T

28:38.233 --> 28:44.300
HAVE A MORTGAGE, PARENTS VOTE.

28:44.366 --> 28:46.733
THIS GUY, HE SAYS ABOUT HIS

28:46.800 --> 28:48.733
UNIVERSITY, HE HAS TRANSFORMED A

28:48.800 --> 28:50.933
BASTION OF FREE INQUIRY INTO A

28:51.000 --> 28:52.633
SOCIAL JUSTICE FACTORY WHICH

28:52.700 --> 28:54.666
ONLY INPUTS ARE RACE, GENDER,

28:54.733 --> 28:55.433
AND VICTIMHOOD, THE ONLY OUTPUTS

28:55.500 --> 29:00.033
ARE GOOD THEM A GRIEVANCE AND

29:00.100 --> 29:00.300
DIVISION.

29:00.366 --> 29:01.233
THIS IS EVERYWHERE.

29:01.300 --> 29:04.300
A TEACHER IN CONNECTICUT

29:04.366 --> 29:05.700
RESIGNED "I DECIDED TO RESIGN

29:05.766 --> 29:07.100
FROM WHAT I THOUGHT WAS MY

29:07.166 --> 29:08.500
FOREVER CAREER BECAUSE I FELT

29:08.566 --> 29:09.466
MORE LIKE A POLITICAL ACTIVIST

29:09.533 --> 29:12.066
THAN A TEACHER IN MY OWN

29:12.133 --> 29:13.000
CLASSROOM.

29:13.066 --> 29:14.700
WHAT'S GOING ON IN CLASSROOMS

29:14.766 --> 29:16.633
ACROSS OUR COUNTRY IS PITTING

29:16.700 --> 29:17.200
STUDENTS AGAINST EACH OTHER

29:17.266 --> 29:20.466
BASED ON THE COLOR OF THEIR

29:20.533 --> 29:20.666
SKIN.

29:20.733 --> 29:22.133
"IN VIRGINIA "I WAS TOLD IN ONE

29:22.200 --> 29:25.633
OF MY SO-CALLED EQUITY TRAININGS

THAT WHITE CHRISTIAN ABLE-BODIED

29:26.900 --> 29:28.100
FEMALES CURRENTLY HAVE THE POWER

29:28.166 --> 29:28.933
IN OUR SCHOOLS AND THAT HAS TO

29:29.033 --> 29:32.900
CHANGE.

29:32.966 --> 29:35.666
"SHE SAID A DISSENTING OPINION

29:35.733 --> 29:36.666
IS NOT ALLOWED TO BE SPOKEN IN

29:36.733 --> 29:40.100
MY PERSONAL LIFE.

29:40.166 --> 29:40.800
IN LOUISIANA, JONATHAN COBLE

29:40.866 --> 29:42.700
SAYS THEY ARE TELLING OUR BLACK

29:42.766 --> 29:44.333
CHILDREN THEY ARE OPPRESSED BY

29:44.400 --> 29:46.366
WHITE PEOPLE SO THEY DON'T HAVE

29:46.433 --> 29:46.666
A CHANCE.

29:46.733 --> 29:48.766
WE WANT TO TEACH EDUCATION, NOT

29:48.833 --> 29:50.200
LEFT WING IDEAS THAT AREN'T

29:50.266 --> 29:53.400
BACKED UP BY FACTS OR SCIENCE.

29:53.466 --> 29:54.066
YOU'VE WRITTEN ABOUT THIS

29:54.133 --> 29:55.200
RECENTLY, I THINK IT'S ON A LOT

29:55.266 --> 30:00.066
OF PEOPLE'S MINDS NOW.

30:00.133 --> 30:01.566
WHAT DO YOU THINK IS GOING TO BE

30:01.633 --> 30:02.266
THE REPERCUSSIONS FROM THE NEXT

30:02.333 --> 30:06.300
ELECTION FOR THIS ISSUE?

30:06.366 --> 30:08.666
>> ORWELLIAN IS AN OVERUSED

30:08.733 --> 30:10.733
ADJECTIVE BUT HERE IT APPLIES.

30:10.800 --> 30:12.866
IN 1984, ORWELL SAID WATCH THE

30:12.933 --> 30:13.533
LANGUAGE BECAUSE IT BECOMES

30:13.600 --> 30:17.100
TURNED INSIDE OUT.

30:17.166 --> 30:18.866
IN 1984, LOVEMAN TATE, WAR MEANT

30:18.933 --> 30:20.533
PEACE COME ON CAMPUS TODAY

30:20.600 --> 30:22.700
DIVERSITY MEANS ENFORCE

30:22.766 --> 30:26.233
CONFORMITY.

30:26.300 --> 30:27.566
THROUGH THE MAGIC OF MODERN

30:27.633 --> 30:34.400
PARENTING, IS AN ISN'T IT

30:34.466 --> 30:35.500
INTERESTING THAT PARENTS BECAME

30:35.566 --> 30:37.566
A VERB RIGHT THIS HAPPENED?

30:37.633 --> 30:40.866
>> PEOPLE NEVER SAID PARENT WAS

30:40.933 --> 30:41.700
A VERB BEFORE?

30:41.766 --> 30:44.533
>> IT'S VERY RECENT.

30:44.600 --> 30:47.033
NOW WE ARE SKILLFUL AT PARENTING

30:47.100 --> 30:48.600
AND THIS PRODUCES PERFECTIONIST

30:48.666 --> 30:50.200
PARENTING, IF YOU ARE RELEASED

30:50.266 --> 30:50.866
CAREFUL OF IT, NO ONE WAS

30:50.933 --> 30:55.966
CHILDREN BELIEVE THIS, IF YOU'RE

30:56.033 --> 30:57.433
REALLY GOOD AT PARENTING YOU

30:57.500 --> 30:58.400
WILL PRODUCE THE PERFECT CHILD

30:58.466 --> 31:00.433
TO WHICH YOU ARE ENTITLED.

31:00.500 --> 31:02.333
THE PROBLEM OF COURSE IS WHAT'S

31:02.400 --> 31:04.066
HAPPENING ON CAMPUS IS THEY ARE

31:04.133 --> 31:05.733
GIVING UP ON THE ESSENTIAL

31:05.800 --> 31:06.500
INGREDIENT OF DEMOCRACY WHICH IS

31:06.566 --> 31:10.300
THE CULTURE OF PERSUASION, AND

31:10.366 --> 31:14.733
THEY ARE GOING TO MANDATE

31:14.800 --> 31:19.066
EVICTION MORATORIUM, VACCINES,

31:19.133 --> 31:21.033
WE NOW MANDATE HARMONY ON CAMPUS

31:21.100 --> 31:22.833
BECAUSE WE HAVE RAISED CHILDREN

31:22.900 --> 31:24.666
TO BE SO RISK-AVERSE AND TO BE

31:24.733 --> 31:26.833
SO CONVINCED THAT THEY ARE

31:26.900 --> 31:27.966
AWESOME, THEY ALL GOT TO

31:28.033 --> 31:28.833
PARTICIPATION TROPHIES FOR

31:28.900 --> 31:31.000
SHOWING UP AT SOCCER PRACTICE

31:31.066 --> 31:32.566
AND THEY ARRIVE AT THE CAMPUS

31:32.633 --> 31:34.233
AND THEY WANT TO HAVE A SAFE

31:34.300 --> 31:37.866
SPACE TO BE SAFE FROM

31:37.933 --> 31:39.333
CHALLENGING IDEAS THAT MIGHT

31:39.400 --> 31:41.766
MAKE THEM SAD.

31:41.833 --> 31:43.533
DID YOU KNOW THAT

31:43.600 --> 31:45.233
BRANDEIS UNIVERSITY, THE PHRASE

31:45.300 --> 31:47.866
"TRIGGER WARNING" NOW REQUIRES A

31:47.933 --> 31:48.233
TRIGGER WARNING?

31:48.300 --> 31:49.033
WARNING SUGGESTS THERE'S A

31:49.100 --> 31:50.666
DANGER AND TRIGGER, YOU KNOW

31:50.733 --> 31:52.866
WHAT THAT MAKES PEOPLE THINK OF.

31:52.933 --> 31:53.466
>> Bill: THE NATIONAL ARCHIVES

31:53.533 --> 31:58.166
PUT A TRIGGER WARNING ON THE

31:58.233 --> 31:58.966
CONSTITUTION AND THE DECLARATION

31:59.033 --> 31:59.466
OF INDEPENDENCE.

31:59.533 --> 32:00.533
>> THEY SAID DOCUMENTS MIGHT BE

32:00.600 --> 32:03.466
HARMFUL OR DIFFICULT TO VIEW.

32:03.533 --> 32:04.966
>> Bill: THIS IS ALWAYS MY

32:05.033 --> 32:06.700
THING WITH DEMOCRATS.

32:06.766 --> 32:08.800
IF WHAT YOU'RE DOING SOUNDS LIKE

32:08.866 --> 32:14.133
A HEADLINE IN THE ONION --

32:14.200 --> 32:16.866
REALLY.

32:16.933 --> 32:18.066
NATIONAL ARCHIVES PUTS TRIGGER

32:18.133 --> 32:18.666
WARNING ON THE DECLARATION OF

32:18.733 --> 32:22.866
INDEPENDENCE, I WOULD SAY

32:22.933 --> 32:23.866
QUALIFIES --

32:23.933 --> 32:25.900
SEATTLE BULLET WHETHER OR NOT TO

32:25.966 --> 32:28.866
DECRIMINALIZE CRIME.

32:28.933 --> 32:31.300
>> THE KIND OF PEOPLE WHO DO

32:31.366 --> 32:33.800
THIS CAME WITHIN AN EYELASH OF

32:33.866 --> 32:36.066
REELECTING DONALD TRUMP WITH

32:36.133 --> 32:37.400
THREE WORDS, DEFUND THE POLICE.

32:37.466 --> 32:41.066
IF YOU THINK THAT'S THE CRAZIEST

32:41.133 --> 32:41.700
THINGS THAT THE PROGRESSIVES CAN

32:41.766 --> 32:43.500
COME UP WITH, YOU DON'T

32:43.566 --> 32:45.400
UNDERSTAND WILL'S LAW WHICH IS

32:45.466 --> 32:47.666
THERE'S NO SUCH THING AS

32:47.733 --> 32:49.500
ROCK-BOTTOM.

32:49.566 --> 32:49.766
[APPLAUSE]

32:49.833 --> 32:51.166
>> THESE ARE TWO DIFFERENT

32:51.233 --> 32:52.866
ISSUES, I'VE ONLY BEEN IN

32:52.933 --> 32:54.266
ACADEMIA FOR THREE YEARS, I'M

32:54.333 --> 32:57.100
NOT A CLASSIC ACADEMIC, I CAME

32:57.166 --> 32:57.533
UP AS A JOURNALIST.

32:57.600 --> 32:59.933
I WILL SAY DIVERSITY OF THOUGHT

33:00.000 --> 33:00.566
IS EXTREMELY IMPORTANT AT LEAST

33:00.633 --> 33:03.200
AT THE UNIVERSITY I WORK AT,

33:03.266 --> 33:03.366
USC.

33:03.433 --> 33:06.900
I TEACH POLITICAL REPORTING, WE

33:06.966 --> 33:09.666
HAVE A VERY GENEROUS ALUM WHO

33:09.733 --> 33:11.833
WANTS TO HELP US EXPOSE STUDENTS

33:11.900 --> 33:13.633
TO THE REAL WORLD OF POLITICS.

33:13.700 --> 33:15.433
WE TAKE THEM ON TRIPS TO

33:15.500 --> 33:16.133
WASHINGTON, D.C., WHERE THEY

33:16.200 --> 33:17.766
MEET REPUBLICANS, THEY MEET

33:17.833 --> 33:18.033
DEMOCRATS.

33:18.100 --> 33:19.633
I TOOK A GROUP OF STUDENTS TO

33:19.700 --> 33:21.033
THE IOWA CAUCUSES WHERE THEY

33:21.100 --> 33:21.833
WERE HEARING PERSPECTIVES THEY

33:21.900 --> 33:23.866
HAD NEVER HEARD IN AREAS WHEN

33:23.933 --> 33:25.100
THEY GROW UP IN CALIFORNIA FOR

33:25.166 --> 33:26.500
THE FIRST TIME.

33:26.566 --> 33:28.200
I NEVER ACTUALLY TALKED TO A

33:28.266 --> 33:28.833
PRO-LIFE PERSON BEFORE ONE

33:28.900 --> 33:31.400
STUDENT TOLD ME.

33:31.466 --> 33:32.900
AT THE SAME TIME, WE KNOW --

33:32.966 --> 33:34.100
>> Bill: THAT DOESN'T SOUND

33:34.166 --> 33:38.466
VERY DIVERSE.

33:38.533 --> 33:39.333
>> ACADEMICS IS PROPELLED BY

33:39.400 --> 33:42.000
LIBERALISM, I HAD A STUDENT RUN

33:42.066 --> 33:43.666
A REPORT ON THE USC PROFESSORS

33:43.733 --> 33:45.233
AND THERE WERE LESS THAN FIVE

33:45.300 --> 33:47.833
THAT HAD DONATED TO DONALD TRUMP

33:47.900 --> 33:48.433
IN THE PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION,

33:48.500 --> 33:50.700
ALL THE DONATIONS FOR ANYBODY

33:50.766 --> 33:52.633
WHO LISTED USC PROFESSOR AND

33:52.700 --> 33:54.066
WHAT YOUR TITLE IS WERE GOING TO

33:54.133 --> 33:56.633
DEMOCRATS, DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE

33:56.700 --> 33:56.966
CANDIDATES.

33:57.033 --> 33:59.300
PEOPLE ARE NOT WRONG WHEN THEY

33:59.366 --> 34:01.633
SENSE A FEELING THERE BUT

34:01.700 --> 34:02.466
DIVERSITY OF THOUGHT IS JUST AS

34:02.533 --> 34:04.833
IMPORTANT AS DIVERSITY OF HOW WE

34:04.900 --> 34:06.333
LOOK IN PROSPECTUS WE COME TO IT

34:06.400 --> 34:07.833
WITH.

34:07.900 --> 34:09.266
THAT'S SOMETHING I BELIEVE MOST

34:09.333 --> 34:10.266
ACADEMIC INSTITUTIONS ARE TRYING

34:10.333 --> 34:12.266
FOR EVEN WHEN YOU HAVE PEOPLE

34:12.333 --> 34:13.333
LIKE THAT PROFESSOR FROM

34:13.400 --> 34:14.600
PORTLAND STATE WHO HAS BEEN

34:14.666 --> 34:17.166
CHALLENGING -- HE HAS TRIED TO

34:17.233 --> 34:18.000
CHALLENGE THAT SCHOOL FOR A LONG

34:18.066 --> 34:19.000
TIME.

34:19.066 --> 34:20.733
HE BRINGS IN DIFFERENT SPEAKERS

34:20.800 --> 34:22.266
AND TRIES TO HAVE THIS

34:22.333 --> 34:22.933
CONVERSATION AND THAT'S

34:23.000 --> 34:24.466
IMPORTANT TO EXPOSE STUDENTS TO

34:24.533 --> 34:26.066
SOMETHING ART EXPERIENCE TO, TO

34:26.133 --> 34:27.366
READ GEORGE WILL'S COLUMNS, I

34:27.433 --> 34:28.566
HAVE MY STUDENTS READ BILL

34:28.633 --> 34:30.066
KRISTOL COLUMNS BECAUSE THEY

34:30.133 --> 34:30.966
AREN'T EXPOSED TO IT AS MUCH AND

34:31.033 --> 34:33.266
THEY HAVE TO BE.

34:33.333 --> 34:33.533
[APPLAUSE]

34:33.600 --> 34:37.366
>> Bill: JUST HAVE THEM READ

34:37.433 --> 34:41.233
GEORGE.

34:41.300 --> 34:42.800
WHAT ABOUT WHAT THESE TEACHERS

34:42.866 --> 34:44.266
ARE SAYING IN SPECIFIC, WHEN

34:44.333 --> 34:45.433
PEOPLE SAY TO ME SOMETIMES YOU

34:45.500 --> 34:46.833
GO AFTER THE LEFT A LOT THESE

34:46.900 --> 34:49.600
DAYS, WHY?

34:49.666 --> 34:52.000
AND I GO "BECAUSE YOU'RE

34:52.066 --> 34:52.666
EMBARRASSING ME!"

34:52.733 --> 34:54.333
THAT'S WHY I GO AFTER THE LEFT

34:54.400 --> 34:55.666
IN THE WAY YOU NEVER DID BEFORE

34:55.733 --> 34:58.266
BECAUSE YOU ARE INVERTING

34:58.333 --> 35:00.000
THAT -- I'M NOT GOING TO GIVE UP

35:00.066 --> 35:00.633
ON BEING LIBERAL.

35:00.700 --> 35:02.833
THIS IS WHAT THESE TEACHERS ARE

35:02.900 --> 35:04.533
TALKING ABOUT.

35:04.600 --> 35:05.600
YOU'RE TAKING CHILDREN AND

35:05.666 --> 35:06.800
MAKING THEM HYPER AWARE OF RACE

35:06.866 --> 35:09.433
IN THE WAY WOULDN'T OTHERWISE

35:09.500 --> 35:09.966
BE.

35:10.033 --> 35:12.166
I SAW LAST NIGHT ON THE FOOTBALL

35:12.233 --> 35:15.233
GAME, ALICIA KEYS SANG "LIFT

35:15.300 --> 35:17.600
EVERY VOICE AND SING" WHICH NOW

35:17.666 --> 35:19.266
I HEAR IS CALLED THE BLACK

35:19.333 --> 35:19.933
NATIONAL ANTHEM.

35:20.000 --> 35:21.833
MAYBE WE SHOULD GET RID OF OUR

35:21.900 --> 35:23.033
NATIONAL ANTHEM BUT I THINK WE

35:23.100 --> 35:24.366
SHOULD HAVE ONE NATIONAL ANTHEM.

35:24.433 --> 35:27.000
I THINK WHEN YOU GO DOWN A ROAD

35:27.066 --> 35:28.933
WE ARE HAVING TWO DIFFERENT

35:29.000 --> 35:30.866
NATIONAL ANTHEMS, COLLEGES

35:30.933 --> 35:33.133
SOMETIMES -- MANY OF THEM HAVE

35:33.200 --> 35:33.766
DIFFERENT GRADUATION CEREMONIES

35:33.833 --> 35:36.333
FOR BLACK-AND-WHITE, SEPARATE

35:36.400 --> 35:39.100
DORMS -- THIS IS WHAT I MEAN,

35:39.166 --> 35:40.366
SEGREGATION.

35:40.433 --> 35:42.700
YOU CONVERTED THE IDEA.

35:42.766 --> 35:43.700
WE ARE GOING BACK TO THAT UNDER

35:43.766 --> 35:47.900
A DIFFERENT NAME.

35:47.966 --> 35:50.900
[APPLAUSE]

35:50.966 --> 35:52.400
YOU'RE MAKING A FACE, HOW DO YOU

35:52.466 --> 35:54.233
SAY THAT IS NOT SEGREGATION, I

35:54.300 --> 35:54.700
DON'T UNDERSTAND?

35:54.766 --> 35:56.100
>> ALL OF THOSE THINGS, THAT

35:56.166 --> 35:57.666
DOES NOT SOUND GOOD TO ME,

35:57.733 --> 35:58.433
THAT'S NOT THE EXPERIENCE I'M

35:58.500 --> 36:02.200
SEEING IN ACADEMIA.

36:02.266 --> 36:03.000
YOU'RE HAVING REAL

36:03.066 --> 36:03.366
CONVERSATIONS --

36:03.433 --> 36:03.966
>> Bill: YOU'RE NOT

36:04.033 --> 36:05.400
EVERYWHERE, THIS IS HAPPENING.

36:05.466 --> 36:06.600
>> THIS IS MY OWN PERSONAL

36:06.666 --> 36:09.133
EXPERIENCE I'M TALKING ABOUT

36:09.200 --> 36:10.733
HERE.

36:10.800 --> 36:13.066
IT IS A MOMENT PEOPLE ARE

36:13.133 --> 36:13.633
RECOGNIZING OTHERS HAVE

36:13.700 --> 36:15.266
DIFFERENT LIVED EXPERIENCES AND

36:15.333 --> 36:16.666
THIS GENERATION, I KNOW WE ARE

36:16.733 --> 36:18.733
GOING WITH THIS, THEY ARE TOO

36:18.800 --> 36:19.700
WOKE AND ALL THAT.

36:19.766 --> 36:22.500
I SPEND MY DAY AROUND 19 TO MY

36:22.566 --> 36:23.100
25-YEAR-OLDS EVERY SINGLE DAY,

36:23.166 --> 36:26.200
HUNDREDS OF THEM A WEEK.

36:26.266 --> 36:26.800
GENERALLY, THEY HAVE A LOT OF

36:26.866 --> 36:28.466
EMPATHY FOR OTHERS.

36:28.533 --> 36:31.233
[APPLAUSE]

36:31.300 --> 36:32.700
EVERYONE GETS A TROPHY, MY KID

36:32.766 --> 36:35.966
LOST AT UNO AND HE WAS PISSED I

36:36.033 --> 36:37.466
DIDN'T LET HIM WIN, THERE'S A

36:37.533 --> 36:38.433
PURPOSE TO THAT I DON'T WANT HIM

36:38.500 --> 36:39.900
TO FEEL LIKE HE'S PERFECTED

36:39.966 --> 36:40.200
EVERYTHING.

36:40.266 --> 36:43.233
THERE'S A MOMENT THESE YOUNG

36:43.300 --> 36:46.700
PEOPLE ARE RECOGNIZING THE WORLD

36:46.766 --> 36:48.766
ISN'T PERFECT AND THEY CAN WORK

36:48.833 --> 36:50.766
TOGETHER TO COLLECTIVELY MAKE IT

36:50.833 --> 36:51.000
BETTER.

36:51.066 --> 36:52.300
>> Bill: YOU THINK THEY

36:52.366 --> 36:54.033
DISCOVERED THAT?

36:54.100 --> 36:54.633
YOU THINK THEY ARE THE FIRST

36:54.700 --> 36:57.266
GENERATION THAT THOUGHT THAT,

36:57.333 --> 36:59.900
THE WORLD ISN'T PERFECT?

36:59.966 --> 37:00.433
EVERY GENERATION THINKS THE

37:00.500 --> 37:08.100
WORLD'S TOTAL TO TO SHIT.

37:08.166 --> 37:11.366
>> HENCE MY INSULT TO

37:11.433 --> 37:13.766
BABY BOOMERS, I BELIEVE THE WAY

37:13.833 --> 37:15.633
THIS GENERATION IS LOOKING AT

37:15.700 --> 37:16.866
THINGS WILL BENEFIT THE

37:16.933 --> 37:17.566
COLLECTIVE GOOD WHERE SO MUCH OF

37:17.633 --> 37:20.200
IT IS SELFISH.

37:20.266 --> 37:21.966
>> Bill: YOU THINK THIS

37:22.033 --> 37:23.433
GENERATION IS LESS SELFISH?

37:23.500 --> 37:26.400
WE'LL AND SEE HOW THAT COMES OUT

37:26.466 --> 37:30.833
ON TIKTOK.

37:30.900 --> 37:34.200
>> WHERE ARE RACE RELATIONS

37:34.266 --> 37:35.100
WORSE, PROBABLY ON CAMPUS WHERE

37:35.166 --> 37:37.100
THEY OBSESS ABOUT RACE

37:37.166 --> 37:38.800
EXCESSIVELY.

37:38.866 --> 37:44.366
AN ENORMOUS NU NUMBER OF PEOPLEA

37:44.433 --> 37:44.966
MULTIBILLION-DOLLAR INCLUSION

37:45.033 --> 37:45.933
INDUSTRY NOW EXISTS IN THIS

37:46.000 --> 37:46.700
COUNTRY TO CONVINCE PEOPLE THAT

37:46.766 --> 37:47.733
THINGS ARE BAD AND GETTING

37:47.800 --> 37:50.733
WORSE, ACTUALLY, THEY ARE

37:50.800 --> 37:51.233
GETTING BETTER.

37:51.300 --> 37:52.300
>> Bill: YES!

37:52.366 --> 37:54.833
>> THE BEST EXAMPLE, THE ONLY

37:54.900 --> 37:56.633
ESTABLISHED RELIGION IN THIS

37:56.700 --> 37:58.200
COUNTRY IS SEC FOOTBALL DOWN

37:58.266 --> 37:58.866
SOUTH, TURN ON THE FOOTBALL GAME

37:58.933 --> 38:03.966
AND YOU WILL SEE GEORGIA,

38:04.033 --> 38:05.400
ALABAMA, AND THE HEAD REFEREE IS

38:05.466 --> 38:06.733
AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN, HE'S

38:06.800 --> 38:08.933
BOSSING EVERYONE AROUND.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.466
THEY WEREN'T ALLOWED TO PLAY IN

38:10.533 --> 38:15.200
THE SEC UNTIL 60 YEARS AGO.

38:15.266 --> 38:16.433
NOW THE DAILY INTERACTIONS OF

38:16.500 --> 38:17.766
NORMAL AMERICANS WERE NOT

38:17.833 --> 38:18.733
OBSESSING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT

38:18.800 --> 38:19.766
THE UNITED STATES WAS FOUNDED ON

38:19.833 --> 38:23.033
RACE IN 1619, NOT OBSESSING

38:23.100 --> 38:23.933
ABOUT CRITICAL RACE THEORY,

38:24.000 --> 38:26.600
THEY'RE GETTING ON WITH THEIR

38:26.666 --> 38:28.333
LIVES AND RACE RELATIONS IN THE

38:28.400 --> 38:32.900
VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICANS

38:32.966 --> 38:33.900
INTERACTIONS HAVE NEVER BEEN

38:33.966 --> 38:34.133
BETTER.

38:34.200 --> 38:36.066
>> Bill: TO THE POINT ABOUT

38:36.133 --> 38:36.933
INVERTING WITH THE GOALS WERE,

38:37.000 --> 38:38.133
WHEN I WAS A KID I WAS TOO YOUNG

38:38.200 --> 38:40.666
TO UNDERSTAND BUT MY FATHER WAS

38:40.733 --> 38:42.100
TELLING ME JOHN F. KENNEDY WAS A

38:42.166 --> 38:43.400
GREAT PRESIDENT BECAUSE HE SENT

38:43.466 --> 38:47.200
THE TROOPS SO THAT BLACK KIDS

38:47.266 --> 38:48.366
COULD GO TO SCHOOL, BECAUSE THE

38:48.433 --> 38:50.200
GOAL WAS TO HAVE AS GOOD

38:50.266 --> 38:50.833
EDUCATION FOR EVERYBODY.

38:50.900 --> 38:53.733
NO I THINK I READ IN YOUR COLUMN

38:53.800 --> 38:54.966
ABOUT THE UNIVERSITY OF OREGON

38:55.033 --> 38:57.633
WHICH HAS DIFFERENT GRADUATION

38:57.700 --> 39:01.633
STANDARDS FOR "PEOPLE OF COLOR,"

39:01.700 --> 39:02.000
LOWER STANDARDS.

39:02.066 --> 39:04.633
WHICH TO ME IS SUCH AN INSULT.

39:04.700 --> 39:06.033
>> OREGON HAS SAID PROFICIENCY

39:06.100 --> 39:08.600
REQUIREMENTS IN MATH AND READING

39:08.666 --> 39:10.166
ARE NOW GOING TO BE SUSPENDED

39:10.233 --> 39:13.633
FOR EQUITY REASONS BECAUSE THERE

39:13.700 --> 39:14.866
ARE DISPROPORTIONATE OUTCOMES.

39:14.933 --> 39:16.033
THIS IS THE SOFT BIGOTRY OF LOW

39:16.100 --> 39:18.200
EXPECTATIONS APPLIED.

39:18.266 --> 39:19.666
>> Bill: THAT'S RIGHT.

39:19.733 --> 39:24.200
[APPLAUSE]

39:24.266 --> 39:24.600
NO?

39:24.666 --> 39:25.666
EVERY TIME YOU MAKE A FACE I

39:25.733 --> 39:29.766
HAVE TO ASK WHY.

39:29.833 --> 39:31.433
>> I THINK THIS IS A

39:31.500 --> 39:33.033
CONVERSATION -- TAKING

39:33.100 --> 39:35.033
STANDARDIZED TESTING AND

39:35.100 --> 39:36.366
DISCUSSING HOW THAT HAS APPLIED

39:36.433 --> 39:40.233
THE LAWSUIT AGAINST HARVARD AND

39:40.300 --> 39:41.766
HOW -- THERE IS A MOMENT TO LOOK

39:41.833 --> 39:44.466
AT WHAT IT MEANS TO GET A

39:44.533 --> 39:46.066
COLLEGE EDUCATION NOW, THERE'S A

39:46.133 --> 39:47.800
MOMENT TO LOOK AT HOW

39:47.866 --> 39:50.166
STANDARDIZED TESTS APPLY TO

39:50.233 --> 39:50.866
GROUPS OF PEOPLE.

39:50.933 --> 39:52.766
THIS IS NOT MY AREA OF

39:52.833 --> 39:53.733
EXPERTISE, AND TEACHING

39:53.800 --> 39:55.333
JOURNALISM, I'M NOT LOOKING AT

39:55.400 --> 39:57.433
ACADEMIA AS A WHOLE AND

39:57.500 --> 39:59.000
ATTEMPTING TO CHANGE IT BUT

39:59.066 --> 39:59.866
UNDERSTANDING WHY THESE

39:59.933 --> 40:00.466
CONVERSATIONS ARE HAPPENING I

40:00.533 --> 40:03.400
THINK IS IMPORTANT RIGHT NOW.

40:03.466 --> 40:07.066
>> Bill: OKAY, LAST QUESTION.

40:07.133 --> 40:08.500
[APPLAUSE]

40:08.566 --> 40:09.066
ANNIVERSARY OF 9/11, I THINK

40:09.133 --> 40:09.866
WE'RE GOING TO FIND OUT A LOT

40:09.933 --> 40:14.066
MORE ABOUT THE SAUDIS, FINALLY,

40:14.133 --> 40:15.900
BIDEN SEEMS TO WANT TO GET INTO

40:15.966 --> 40:17.166
WHAT WE HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO

40:17.233 --> 40:17.900
SEE FOR YEARS.

40:17.966 --> 40:19.500
I REMEMBER SEEING ALL OF THOSE

40:19.566 --> 40:23.433
REPORTS, INTERNAL REPORTS,

40:23.500 --> 40:24.066
SECURITY REPORTS WERE EVERYTHING

40:24.133 --> 40:26.300
WAS BLACKED OUT.

40:26.366 --> 40:29.233
EVERYTHING ABOUT THE SAUDIS, WE

40:29.300 --> 40:30.666
CAN KNOW.

40:30.733 --> 40:31.966
I'M JUST WONDERING, SINCE THIS

40:32.033 --> 40:34.433
IS A FEW YEARS PAST WE KNOW WHEN

40:34.500 --> 40:37.233
THEY KILLED JAMAL KHASHOGGI WITH

40:37.300 --> 40:40.633
A BONE SAW, WILL THAT COLOR OUR

40:40.700 --> 40:41.366
THINKING OF WHAT THE SAUDIS ARE

40:41.433 --> 40:42.666
CAPABLE OF AND WHAT THEY MIGHT

40:42.733 --> 40:44.866
HAVE BEEN DOING PRE9/11?

40:44.933 --> 40:45.666
>> THAT'S WITH LUDACRIS ABOUT

40:45.733 --> 40:47.300
THE FACT THAT THE GOVERNMENT HAS

40:47.366 --> 40:49.500
BEEN HIDING AND TOLD BIDEN UNDER

40:49.566 --> 40:51.500
EXTREME PRESSURE WAS TOLD BY

40:51.566 --> 40:52.133
SURVIVORS OF THE FAMILIES WOULD

40:52.200 --> 40:54.766
NOT BE WELCOME AT 111

40:54.833 --> 40:56.800
COMMEMORATIVE EVENTS, IF HE

40:56.866 --> 40:58.933
DIDN'T RELEASE HITHERTO KEPT

40:59.000 --> 41:01.200
SECRET REPORTS OF THE 9/11

41:01.266 --> 41:04.700
COMMISSION -- THAT MIGHT CAUSE

41:04.766 --> 41:07.166
THE SAUDIS TO HAVE A BAD

41:07.233 --> 41:09.700
REPUTATION.

41:09.766 --> 41:10.700
[LAUGHTER]

41:10.766 --> 41:12.300
HOW DO YOU LOSE A REPUTATION YOU

41:12.366 --> 41:14.733
FORFEITED WITH 15 OF YOUR MEN

41:14.800 --> 41:16.333
WITH OBVIOUS AID AND COMFORT

41:16.400 --> 41:18.733
FROM SAUDI OFFICIALS AND

41:18.800 --> 41:19.433
CHARITIES, SO-CALLED, RUN BY THE

41:19.500 --> 41:23.033
GOVERNMENT -- FLEW THE PLANES.

41:23.100 --> 41:25.466
THE IDEA WE ARE PROTECTING THE

41:25.533 --> 41:26.600
SAUDIS FROM FORFEITING A

41:26.666 --> 41:28.366
REPUTATION HE FORFEITED LONG AGO

41:28.433 --> 41:29.533
IS ABSURD.

41:29.600 --> 41:32.233
SECRECY MAKES US IGNORANT,

41:32.300 --> 41:33.166
SECRECY IS GOVERNMENT

41:33.233 --> 41:33.466
REGULATION.

41:33.533 --> 41:34.766
MOST GOVERNMENT REGULATIONS --

41:34.833 --> 41:38.866
[APPLAUSE]

41:38.933 --> 41:42.666
OBVIOUSLY YOU NEED SOME SECRETS

41:42.733 --> 41:43.766
TO PROTECT GOVERNMENT

41:43.833 --> 41:46.033
DELIBERATIONS AND SOURCES AND

41:46.100 --> 41:48.200
METHODS OF INTELLIGENCE, BUT

41:48.266 --> 41:49.033
MOST REGULATION TELLS US WHAT WE

41:49.100 --> 41:51.600
CANNOT DO.

41:51.666 --> 41:55.066
SECRECY TELLS US WHAT WE CANNOT

41:55.133 --> 41:56.066
KNOW AND GOVERNMENT ALWAYS HAS

41:56.133 --> 41:58.033
AN INTEREST TO MAXIMIZE SECRECY

41:58.100 --> 41:59.566
AS ITS PRIVATE PROPERTY WHICH IS

41:59.633 --> 42:02.166
WHY I SALUTE THE FAMILIES, MORE

42:02.233 --> 42:04.000
THAN 2,000 PEOPLE PUT PRESSURE

42:04.066 --> 42:05.833
ON THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION AND

42:05.900 --> 42:06.433
THE BIDEN ADMINISTRATION SAID

42:06.500 --> 42:10.333
"WELL, OKAY, WE'LL WE THINK

42:10.400 --> 42:11.166
THIS.

42:11.233 --> 42:12.333
WATCH THEM COME AFTER 9/11 HAS

42:12.400 --> 42:13.966
PASSED AND THE FLEETING

42:14.033 --> 42:15.133
ATTENTION SPAN OF THE AMERICAN

42:15.200 --> 42:17.066
PEOPLE MOVES ON, WE'LL SEE IF

42:17.133 --> 42:17.633
THEY ACTUALLY RELEASE THIS.

42:17.700 --> 42:20.766
>> Bill: WHEN YOU TALK ABOUT

42:20.833 --> 42:21.633
SECRECY, I MUST SAY THE THING I

42:21.700 --> 42:24.400
ALWAYS THINK OF AS A SECRET IS

42:24.466 --> 42:25.466

TO THE EAST OF US, FLOODING, TO

50:45.033 --> 50:46.400
THE WEST, A GIANT RESERVOIR

50:46.466 --> 50:48.333
CALLED THE PACIFIC OCEAN -- OH

50:48.400 --> 50:50.533
YES THE OCEAN.

50:50.600 --> 50:51.900
DID YOU KNOW THAT ISRAEL GETS

50:51.966 --> 50:54.066
MOST OF ITS WATER FROM THE

50:54.133 --> 50:55.466
OCEAN, FROM DESALINIZATION?

50:55.533 --> 50:57.766
WHY CAN'T WE DO DESALINIZATION

50:57.833 --> 51:01.433
IF ISRAEL DOES?

51:01.500 --> 51:05.566
WE HAVE JEWS HERE -- I'M SURE

51:05.633 --> 51:05.866
[LAUGHTER]

51:05.933 --> 51:07.566
[APPLAUSE]

51:07.633 --> 51:09.166
THEY CAN FIGURE IT OUT.

51:09.233 --> 51:11.133
WE HAVE LOTS OF SMART PEOPLE.

51:11.200 --> 51:12.633
THE PROBLEM ISN'T ONE OF

51:12.700 --> 51:13.866
KNOW-HOW EITHER -- IT'S WILL.

51:13.933 --> 51:14.700
AND SELFISHNESS.

51:14.766 --> 51:16.966
AND GREED.

51:17.033 --> 51:18.966
THINK ABOUT IT LOGICALLY: WHY

51:19.033 --> 51:19.600
WOULD IT REALLY BE HARDER TO GET

51:19.666 --> 51:22.733
WATER THROUGH A PIPE THAN OIL?

51:22.800 --> 51:24.000
THE U.S. ALREADY HAS 2.6 MILLION

51:24.066 --> 51:25.566
MILES OF PIPELINES.

51:25.633 --> 51:27.033
TO TRANSPORT OIL.

51:27.100 --> 51:29.166
AND NATURAL GAS, AND HAZARDOUS

51:29.233 --> 51:32.300
LIQUIDS -- ARE THEY ALL REALLY

51:32.366 --> 51:34.633
EASIER TO MOVE THAN WATER?

51:34.700 --> 51:35.666
IS A WATER PIPELINE REALLY MORE

51:35.733 --> 51:37.366
OF AN ENGINEERING CHALLENGE THAN

51:37.433 --> 51:39.066
WHEN WE BUILT RAILROADS THROUGH

51:39.133 --> 51:40.966
THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS, OR LAID THE

51:41.033 --> 51:42.733
TRANS-ATLANTIC CABLE, OR MADE

51:42.800 --> 51:44.800
THE PANAMA CANAL?

51:44.866 --> 51:47.533
OR PUT A MAN ON THE MOON, WHICH,

51:47.600 --> 51:49.733
EVEN IF YOU THINK WAS FAKED, YOU

51:49.800 --> 51:51.133
HAVE TO ADMIT: PULLING OFF A

51:51.200 --> 51:52.600
PRANK LIKE THAT WOULD IN ITSELF

51:52.666 --> 51:53.300
BE QUITE A REMARKABLE

51:53.366 --> 52:03.400
ACHIEVEMENT.

52:03.466 --> 52:07.833
[CHEERS AND APPLAUSE]

52:07.900 --> 52:08.866
MOVING WATER IS NOT IMPOSSIBLE.

52:08.933 --> 52:09.500
IT CAN BE DONE.

52:09.566 --> 52:10.400
OTHERS HAVE DONE IT.

52:10.466 --> 52:11.033
THE ROMANS DID IT WITH 1ST

52:11.100 --> 52:12.366
CENTURY TECHNOLOGY -- SOME OF

52:12.433 --> 52:14.500
THEIR AQUEDUCTS ARE STILL IN

52:14.566 --> 52:14.666
USE.

52:14.733 --> 52:15.566
THE INCAS, THE MINOANS, THE

52:15.633 --> 52:16.666
EGYPTIANS, LOTS OF ANCIENT

52:16.733 --> 52:17.866
PEOPLE DID IT.

52:17.933 --> 52:20.600
AND LET'S NOT FORGET MOSES

52:20.666 --> 52:26.900
PARTING THE RED SEA.

52:26.966 --> 52:27.166
[LAUGHTER]

52:27.233 --> 52:27.433
[APPLAUSE]

52:27.500 --> 52:29.366
CHINA DOES IT NOW.

52:29.433 --> 52:31.366
BEIJING DEPENDS ON WATER THAT IS

52:31.433 --> 52:33.533
PROVIDED BY THEIR MASSIVE

52:33.600 --> 52:35.933
SOUTH-NORTH WATER TRANSFER

52:36.000 --> 52:38.533
PROJECT WHICH WAS BEGUN IN

52:38.600 --> 52:40.633
DECEMBER OF 2002, AND OF COURSE,

52:40.700 --> 52:42.000
BEING CHINA COMPLETED THE NEXT

52:42.066 --> 52:50.866
DAY.

52:50.933 --> 52:51.166
[LAUGHTER]

52:51.233 --> 52:51.433
[APPLAUSE]

52:51.500 --> 52:54.500
BUT IN AMERICA, WE DON'T EVEN

52:54.566 --> 52:55.766
START, BECAUSE WE KNOW: WHY

52:55.833 --> 52:59.066
WOULD IT BE ANY DIFFERENT FROM

52:59.133 --> 53:00.733
EVERY OTHER AMBITIOUS PROJECT --

53:00.800 --> 53:02.066
LIKE AFGHANISTAN -- THAT ALWAYS

53:02.133 --> 53:03.066
JUST TURNS INTO A GIANT MONEY

53:03.133 --> 53:05.300
GRAB?

53:05.366 --> 53:07.166
HERE IN CALIFORNIA WE KNOW: WE

53:07.233 --> 53:07.866
CAN'T HOUSE THE HOMELESS BECAUSE

53:07.933 --> 53:09.766
THE COST OF A SINGLE UNIT HAS

53:09.833 --> 53:12.566
RISEN TO 750,000 DOLLARS.

53:12.633 --> 53:14.000
WE TRIED TO BUILD HIGH-SPEED

53:14.066 --> 53:15.000
RAIL.

53:15.066 --> 53:16.133
THEY FINALLY PULLED THE PLUG ON

53:16.200 --> 53:17.300
THAT BECAUSE THE COST GOT SO OUT

53:17.366 --> 53:18.566
OF HAND.

53:18.633 --> 53:20.633
THAT'S WHY NOTHING EVER GETS

53:20.700 --> 53:21.933
DONE IN THIS COUNTRY, BECAUSE SO

53:22.000 --> 53:23.466
MUCH BULLSHIT IS BUILT INTO

53:23.533 --> 53:24.733
EVERYTHING, THAT IT'S A

53:24.800 --> 53:26.600
BOONDOGGLE BEFORE IT STARTS.

53:26.666 --> 53:29.066
THIS IS OUR TRAGIC FLAW: THE

53:29.133 --> 53:30.600
EVER BALLOONING COSTS, THE

53:30.666 --> 53:32.766
INFLATED CONTRACTS, THE

53:32.833 --> 53:34.933
BACK-SCRATCHING, THE KICKBACKS,

53:35.000 --> 53:35.900
THE PRIVATE CONTRACTORS, THE

53:35.966 --> 53:37.966
PADDED EXPENSE ACCOUNTS, THE

53:38.033 --> 53:40.500
LAYERS AND LAYERS OF

53:40.566 --> 53:41.633
"CONSULTANTS," THE PERMITS, THE

53:41.700 --> 53:43.933
FEES, THE ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT

53:44.000 --> 53:46.733
STATEMENTS, THE LAWSUITS, THE

53:46.800 --> 53:50.433
LAWYERS, THE LOBBYISTS, THE RED

53:50.500 --> 53:50.633
TAPE.

53:50.700 --> 53:52.466
GRAFT ON A SCALE UNTAMABLE.

53:52.533 --> 53:53.566
BUT 78 MILLION PEOPLE LIVE IN

53:53.633 --> 53:55.633
THE WEST.

53:55.700 --> 53:56.900
WHAT DO WE DO IN THE NOT

53:57.000 --> 53:58.000
SO-DISTANT FUTURE WHEN THEY'RE

53:58.066 --> 54:00.366
ALL WATER REFUGEES?

54:00.433 --> 54:02.300
THE COLORADO RIVER SUPPLIES

54:02.366 --> 54:03.466
FORTY MILLION PEOPLE WITH THE

54:03.533 --> 54:05.666
WATER THEY NEED TO LIVE, AND

54:05.733 --> 54:07.333
IT'S DRYING UP -- THOSE PEOPLE

54:07.400 --> 54:09.533
CAN'T ALL GET IN COVERED WAGONS,

54:09.600 --> 54:10.266
HEAD EAST AND MOVE BACK IN WITH

54:10.333 --> 54:14.933
THEIR PARENTS.

54:15.000 --> 54:15.200
