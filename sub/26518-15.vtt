00:18.060 --> 00:19.060
What are you doing?

00:19.186 --> 00:20.186
We have to help.

00:20.562 --> 00:21.769
Somebody might
be in there.

00:22.147 --> 00:23.888
We're not supposed
to leave the truck.

00:42.459 --> 00:43.791
Must be my birthday.

00:45.170 --> 00:47.457
We're only here
for one thing.

00:49.007 --> 00:51.624
Come on, we've got
a whole armory here.

00:57.474 --> 00:59.215
This is all we need.

01:00.561 --> 01:01.597
<i>Okay, well, uh,</i>

01:01.770 --> 01:03.610
it's been a while since
we've all been together

01:03.647 --> 01:05.889
as a team since Jane
stopped being evil,

01:06.066 --> 01:08.479
and since you stopped
pretending to be evil,

01:08.652 --> 01:11.065
and I thought we should
commemorate this occasion

01:11.238 --> 01:12.479
by unveiling...

01:14.616 --> 01:15.616
<i>"Tattoo Squad"!</i>

01:15.742 --> 01:17.358
<i>The semi-cooperative
European style</i>

01:17.536 --> 01:18.993
<i>worker placement
card drafting game</i>

01:19.162 --> 01:21.279
<i>with bidding elements
and character customization.</i>

01:21.456 --> 01:22.896
You know, to mitigate
the dice rolls.

01:23.292 --> 01:24.292
It's a board game!

01:24.376 --> 01:26.959
<i>Starring us!
Solving complicated mysteries</i>

01:27.087 --> 01:28.203
<i>by completing puzzle tests</i>

01:28.380 --> 01:29.871
on three
unique boards!

01:30.465 --> 01:31.922
I'm both impressed
and horrified.

01:32.175 --> 01:36.294
Thank you! And, for the game
<i>piÃ¨ce de rÃ©sistance.</i>

01:36.763 --> 01:38.504
<i>Et voila!</i>
Okay.

01:38.682 --> 01:40.368
Now, they're just prototypes,
just keep in mind.

01:40.392 --> 01:41.633
We all get one.
There you go.

01:41.810 --> 01:43.517
There you are.
Right? Okay?

01:43.687 --> 01:46.020
Now, we can play as ourselves,
we can play with each other.

01:46.189 --> 01:47.805
I call Jane, so you get me.
There you go.

01:49.276 --> 01:51.939
Why is mine so much shorter
than Patterson?

01:52.112 --> 01:53.381
It's not supposed
to be to scale.

01:53.405 --> 01:54.841
It's just a prototype.
It's not meant to...

01:54.865 --> 01:56.197
It's cute that way,
I think.

01:56.366 --> 01:57.573
Why is my face all melty?

01:57.743 --> 01:59.137
Well, maybe if you'd
invited me to your game nights

01:59.161 --> 02:00.430
you would have had
a better sculpt.

02:00.454 --> 02:01.786
Okay, this just got weird.

02:01.955 --> 02:04.288
I think it's amazing,
Rich.

02:04.458 --> 02:05.935
It's a great way
to celebrate the team.

02:05.959 --> 02:06.699
<i>You're right.</i>

02:06.835 --> 02:08.918
We have all been
through a lot,

02:09.086 --> 02:11.247
and it's nice to know that
we're on the same side again.

02:11.381 --> 02:13.141
Okay, all right.
So let's see who goes first.

02:13.175 --> 02:14.652
Everybody grab the 20-sided die.
Here we go.

02:14.676 --> 02:16.463
Maybe later.
Jane, they're ready for us.

02:16.803 --> 02:18.465
Okay, yeah.

02:19.222 --> 02:22.260
So our agents brought in
everything they discovered

02:22.434 --> 02:24.721
in the abandoned
Sandstorm safe house.

02:24.895 --> 02:26.227
We thought you could
take a look.

02:26.396 --> 02:28.124
It's nice of Shepherd
to leave us a key to the place

02:28.148 --> 02:29.480
before she died.

02:29.983 --> 02:31.770
Yeah. Key to her old
terror cell hideout.

02:31.943 --> 02:33.150
How parental of her.

02:33.320 --> 02:35.232
So you recognize the key,

02:35.405 --> 02:36.987
but you've never
been there before?

02:37.157 --> 02:39.240
Well, Shepherd had
safe houses and stash sites

02:39.409 --> 02:40.409
all over the place.

02:40.452 --> 02:41.613
It was our job to know

02:41.787 --> 02:43.870
which key unlocked
which site, but...

02:44.039 --> 02:46.199
I was only ever allowed
to go to a few of them,

02:46.333 --> 02:48.290
<i>and never that one,
so...</i>

02:49.169 --> 02:52.503
Whatever's behind this door,
she wanted me to find now.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.756
If she had a plan
set in motion before she died,

02:54.925 --> 02:56.666
we should definitely
investigate.

02:57.636 --> 02:59.923
On the other hand,
I guess this could be a trap.

03:00.097 --> 03:02.510
Shepherd doesn't have
any power over us anymore.

03:03.850 --> 03:05.432
None.

03:07.312 --> 03:08.393
You ready?

03:17.948 --> 03:18.948
Kinda looks like Shepherd

03:19.116 --> 03:21.654
was getting ready
for a yard sale.

03:22.035 --> 03:23.846
<i>Does any of this stuff
look familiar to you?</i>

03:23.870 --> 03:25.406
<i>Another win for Remi.</i>

03:28.291 --> 03:30.533
Yeah. Yeah, I recognize
almost all of it.

03:31.086 --> 03:33.078
This triggering
any memories?

03:33.255 --> 03:34.255
Yeah.

03:34.756 --> 03:36.668
But it's different
than it used to be

03:36.842 --> 03:38.174
<i>when I couldn't
remember my past.</i>

03:38.343 --> 03:40.756
<i>Those were
fragments, flashes.</i>

03:40.929 --> 03:42.670
This is, um...

03:42.848 --> 03:44.635
This is like everything
all at once.

03:45.767 --> 03:48.134
<i>All these old,
fully-formed memories</i>

03:48.311 --> 03:52.055
<i>just leapfrogging to the front
of my brain.</i>

03:53.817 --> 03:56.400
It's just... a lot.

03:56.570 --> 03:58.250
<i>It's not a good feeling</i>

03:58.280 --> 03:59.799
<i>wondering if you can
trust your own daughter.</i>

03:59.823 --> 04:00.904
<i>I'm sorry, Jane.</i>

04:01.324 --> 04:02.927
<i>I don't need you to be sorry.</i>

04:12.961 --> 04:14.748
- I need a minute.
- Wait... Jane...

04:14.921 --> 04:15.921
Just...

04:18.550 --> 04:20.310
<i>We'll catalogue
this stuff later.</i>

04:20.385 --> 04:22.091
We got a tattoo hit.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.423
Okay.

04:27.642 --> 04:28.302
What do we got?

04:28.602 --> 04:30.682
Uh, you know that armored truck
robbery this morning?

04:30.812 --> 04:32.474
<i>The one that was
hauling an arsenal.</i>

04:32.647 --> 04:34.479
<i>Yes, every delicious
piece of ordinance</i>

04:34.649 --> 04:36.732
is present and accounted for,
except one.

04:36.943 --> 04:38.684
Thieves...
Left one empty crate.

04:38.862 --> 04:41.320
<i>The Hermes tattoo
on Jane's body</i>

04:41.490 --> 04:43.823
<i>contains
a serial number</i>

04:43.950 --> 04:45.910
<i>that matches whatever
was stolen during the heist.</i>

04:46.036 --> 04:47.117
"Whatever was stolen"?

04:47.287 --> 04:48.514
What do you mean?
Don't we know?

04:48.538 --> 04:50.154
The company
that owns the truck

04:50.332 --> 04:52.560
is being pretty tight-lipped
about whatever was on board.

04:52.584 --> 04:53.744
<i>SilverMark Industries.</i>

04:53.835 --> 04:55.827
Weapons developer
and defense contractor.

04:56.004 --> 04:57.523
FBI's had an eye on them
for a while now.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.707
Aren't they suspected of supplying
the chemical weapons

04:59.841 --> 05:01.798
<i>used in that hotel attack
a few years ago?</i>

05:01.968 --> 05:04.408
Unfortunately, we weren't able
to tie anything to Silver Mark.

05:04.554 --> 05:06.841
All right, so how did they
respond to the robbery?

05:07.015 --> 05:08.677
They'll file
a police report

05:08.850 --> 05:10.716
once they've done a full
inventory audit.

05:10.894 --> 05:12.135
Yeah, that sounds
super legit.

05:12.312 --> 05:13.539
So they must have been
hauling something

05:13.563 --> 05:14.563
they shouldn't have been.

05:14.689 --> 05:15.958
What about the guards
in the truck?

05:15.982 --> 05:16.768
Are they alive?

05:16.942 --> 05:19.434
Battered and bruised,
but treated and released.

05:19.611 --> 05:22.465
SilverMark doesn't tell their guards
whatever it is that they're transporting.

05:22.489 --> 05:24.592
I guess they're not as tempted
to steal whatever's on board

05:24.616 --> 05:25.777
if they don't know
what it is.

05:25.951 --> 05:27.470
Well, someone knew.
Thieves figured it out.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.201
I'm sure you guys
can, too.

05:32.582 --> 05:33.582
<i>Hey.</i>

05:34.000 --> 05:35.269
Just a heads-up, I've been
making rounds again

05:35.293 --> 05:36.293
with my contacts.

05:36.419 --> 05:37.563
- Any leads on Madeline?
- Not yet.

05:37.587 --> 05:38.873
Her trail's getting cold.

05:39.005 --> 05:40.566
If we don't bring her in,
the CIA will be

05:40.590 --> 05:42.026
highly motivated
to hold you accountable,

05:42.050 --> 05:43.416
whether you deserve it
or not.

05:43.593 --> 05:45.425
What did one girl do
to get so lucky?

05:45.595 --> 05:46.802
<i>Hey, look...</i>

05:47.848 --> 05:49.589
I see you pushing yourself,
and that's good.

05:50.183 --> 05:52.596
<i>Just know that while we sort
this whole Madeline thing out,</i>

05:53.103 --> 05:55.390
you got an entire team
you can lean on, all right?

05:57.274 --> 05:59.641
I know.
And I appreciate it.

06:03.280 --> 06:05.317
- What is it?
<i>- It's Keaton.</i>

06:06.658 --> 06:07.899
<i>So no backup.</i>

06:08.910 --> 06:09.570
Nobody to vouch

06:09.744 --> 06:11.531
you're one
of the good guys.

06:12.247 --> 06:13.988
Madeline on your tail.

06:15.250 --> 06:17.412
I'm amazed
you're still alive.

06:18.378 --> 06:20.791
I'd hate to be you
right now.

06:20.964 --> 06:22.876
Says the guy who just
got out of a coma.

06:25.176 --> 06:26.776
You vouching for Tasha
will go a long way

06:26.887 --> 06:28.298
in clearing her name.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.630
Tasha...

06:31.683 --> 06:35.347
<i>I put you in
an impossible situation,</i>

06:35.520 --> 06:38.604
<i>and I jeopardized the trust
of the people you care about.</i>

06:39.524 --> 06:42.938
Sabrina Larren and the CIA
are still gunning for Tasha.

06:43.111 --> 06:45.111
They're not happy about how
any of this played out.

06:45.280 --> 06:46.487
I will be back later today

06:46.656 --> 06:48.397
with the authority
to take that woman

06:48.575 --> 06:50.066
into CIA custody.

06:50.619 --> 06:52.110
If we want them
to back off,

06:52.287 --> 06:53.806
taking down Madeline
and getting her to talk

06:53.830 --> 06:55.071
is pretty much
our only hope.

06:55.916 --> 06:57.908
Well, I know
you're innocent.

06:58.418 --> 06:59.698
<i>But there's something
at my place</i>

06:59.836 --> 07:01.168
<i>that might help
prove it.</i>

07:02.881 --> 07:05.339
A USB drive
in a concealed compartment

07:05.508 --> 07:07.124
in my desk drawer.

07:07.302 --> 07:08.884
Password is "Narsil."

07:10.472 --> 07:13.556
<i>It's a detailed record
of everything I had you do...</i>

07:13.725 --> 07:15.637
<i>what, where, when.</i>

07:17.562 --> 07:19.269
Just get that drive.

07:20.398 --> 07:21.398
Done.

07:21.733 --> 07:23.144
It's good
to have you back.

07:24.027 --> 07:26.064
So, I revisited the tattoo

07:26.237 --> 07:29.150
and realized it's not
just a serial number.

07:29.324 --> 07:32.158
<i>By doing a full spectrum
analysis on each digit,</i>

07:32.327 --> 07:33.930
<i>- I found these.
- Hey, puzzle pieces.</i>

07:33.954 --> 07:35.181
- Yeah.
- How traditional!

07:35.205 --> 07:36.036
Why don't you try
arranging them

07:36.206 --> 07:36.946
in numerical order?

07:41.878 --> 07:43.118
<i>Those look familiar.</i>

07:44.089 --> 07:45.671
They're on
the computer chip tattoo.

07:49.469 --> 07:51.586
<i>So why is the "i"
in "ASiA"</i>

07:51.763 --> 07:53.425
<i>the only word
that's not capitalized?</i>

07:54.432 --> 07:55.432
Silicon.

07:56.851 --> 07:59.218
The semiconductor material
used in computer chips.

07:59.396 --> 08:01.036
Big "S," little "i"
on the periodic table.

08:01.106 --> 08:02.392
Okay, so Hermes
is not Hermes,

08:02.565 --> 08:03.271
<i>he's Mercury.</i>

08:03.441 --> 08:04.852
Same God, different name.

08:05.026 --> 08:08.019
Okay, so if we add
the atomic numbers...

08:08.196 --> 08:11.610
<i>- Mercury is 80.</i>
- Silicon is 14, duh.

08:11.783 --> 08:13.194
So that's...

08:13.368 --> 08:14.368
94.

08:15.328 --> 08:16.328
It adds to 94...

08:16.496 --> 08:18.408
Are you having trouble
with simple math?

08:20.667 --> 08:22.784
Oh... 94.

08:23.211 --> 08:26.079
<i>This is bad.
This is very bad.</i>

08:26.297 --> 08:27.378
Whoever robbed that truck,

08:27.549 --> 08:28.693
they just stole
the key component

08:28.717 --> 08:29.958
for a nuclear weapon.

08:30.385 --> 08:31.546
Oh, my God.

08:32.511 --> 08:33.844
<i>They've got plutonium.</i>

08:52.949 --> 08:56.442
Well! This is quite
the pickle, huh?

08:56.786 --> 08:59.028
Most of you know
Dave Kirkpatrick of the DIA.

08:59.205 --> 09:00.885
Since we're dealing
with missing plutonium,

09:00.999 --> 09:02.679
Director Weitz asked
that he be brought in.

09:02.751 --> 09:04.103
Oh, is this that Dave?

09:04.127 --> 09:06.710
My God, it's like Tintin
joined the debate team.

09:06.880 --> 09:09.122
He's an expert at nuclear
weaponry and tech,

09:09.299 --> 09:11.461
so let's put Agent Kirkpatrick's
skills to good use.

09:11.634 --> 09:13.341
Oh, it's Dave.

09:13.511 --> 09:15.093
Dave. We're all
friends here.

09:15.388 --> 09:18.347
The Defense Intelligence Agency
is, uh, happy to help

09:18.516 --> 09:20.599
- get you guys back on track.
- Thank you, Dave.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.254
<i>We don't know how much
of the plutonium was stolen.</i>

09:23.396 --> 09:26.434
But even the smallest amount
poses a massive threat.

09:26.608 --> 09:28.565
Oh, yeah.
It's a real humdinger.

09:29.277 --> 09:31.360
One of the most dangerous
substances on Earth.

09:31.529 --> 09:33.020
Depending on
the weaponization method.

09:33.490 --> 09:35.903
<i>Whether it's a dirty bomb,
gun-type casing,</i>

09:36.076 --> 09:38.033
implosion model
on the fission end of things.

09:38.203 --> 09:39.489
There are no good scenarios.

09:39.662 --> 09:40.994
We need to find
that plutonium.

09:41.164 --> 09:42.404
Rich, Patterson,
I want you guys

09:42.540 --> 09:43.976
- to work with Agent Kirkpatrick.
- Ah...

09:44.000 --> 09:45.000
Dave.

09:45.210 --> 09:46.604
See if you could find out
who stole the stuff,

09:46.628 --> 09:47.988
and what they plan
on using it for.

09:48.338 --> 09:49.624
I'll check in with SilverMark,

09:49.798 --> 09:50.858
see if I can get them
to talk.

09:50.882 --> 09:52.482
Yeah, I'll contact
local law enforcement.

09:52.592 --> 09:53.944
Those burning cars
at the crime scene

09:53.968 --> 09:55.196
- must have come from somewhere.
- Sounds good.

09:55.220 --> 09:56.220
Let's make it happen.

09:56.387 --> 09:57.423
Okay.

10:03.478 --> 10:06.937
I, uh, found the drive
at Keaton's apartment.

10:07.148 --> 10:08.626
Great. You can start
working on your defense

10:08.650 --> 10:10.186
<i>for when the CIA
comes calling.</i>

10:12.695 --> 10:15.403
- What's up?
- It's just strange being at Keaton's apartment alone.

10:15.615 --> 10:17.885
His wife and his daughter are staying
with family by the hospital.

10:17.909 --> 10:18.909
Something happen?

10:20.495 --> 10:21.861
No, I just...

10:23.748 --> 10:25.330
<i>He's got
a really nice home.</i>

10:26.960 --> 10:28.576
Keaton the family man,
huh?

10:28.753 --> 10:30.873
So I guess he does have a human side.
I wasn't so sure.

10:31.172 --> 10:33.710
And it all gets destroyed
if we don't clear our names.

10:35.510 --> 10:37.154
Sometimes you forget
how dangerous this can be

10:37.178 --> 10:39.044
for people
you care about the most.

10:44.561 --> 10:46.052
I'm gonna get this
checked out.

10:51.442 --> 10:53.775
I'm just gonna say it.
SilverMark Industries?

10:53.945 --> 10:56.107
You guys really should have
kept a closer eye on them.

10:56.281 --> 10:57.897
Thank you, Dave.
That is so helpful.

10:58.366 --> 10:59.885
No, you know what?
I think Clay Aiken's

10:59.909 --> 11:01.992
better-dressed stunt double
has a point.

11:02.203 --> 11:04.786
- He does?
- Who's Clay Aiken again? Baseball?

11:04.956 --> 11:07.059
We know that SilverMark
keeps their deliveries covert,

11:07.083 --> 11:09.243
so if we can't even figure out
what they're carrying...

11:09.377 --> 11:11.710
How could the robbers know?
Unless it was an inside job.

11:11.880 --> 11:14.372
What if it
was an inside job?

11:14.549 --> 11:16.711
It's pretty much always
an inside job, Patterson.

11:17.260 --> 11:18.740
<i>Okay, okay, so we look for</i>

11:18.887 --> 11:21.971
someone on SilverMark's
payroll with a criminal past.

11:22.140 --> 11:23.506
<i>Nothing damning here.</i>

11:23.683 --> 11:25.891
Sam in Accounting
missed an alimony payment,

11:26.019 --> 11:29.308
Charlotte in HR punched a DJ
at a rave in 1998.

11:29.480 --> 11:31.400
Oh, well, I can empathize
with that impulse, huh?

11:31.566 --> 11:32.807
Okay, if it was an employee

11:32.984 --> 11:35.192
they wouldn't have gone
into work on heist day.

11:36.112 --> 11:37.552
<i>Gertrude Simmons,
maintenance worker,</i>

11:37.655 --> 11:40.523
hired in June, swapped shifts
at the last minute.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.441
Wait a minute.
I recognize that face.

11:42.911 --> 11:45.449
That's not Gertrude Simmons.
That's Greta Smalls.

11:45.663 --> 11:47.343
<i>She's been on
the DIA list for a while now.</i>

11:47.415 --> 11:48.451
She's an arms dealer.

11:48.791 --> 11:50.123
<i>If I can bring her in,</i>

11:50.293 --> 11:53.036
this would be a pretty
big win for me.

11:54.047 --> 11:56.380
And obviously for us,
team-wise, right?

11:56.549 --> 11:58.632
Every seller needs a buyer.

11:58.801 --> 12:00.838
I'm gonna look into
last known associates.

12:01.554 --> 12:03.420
DIA's been trying to
access the dark web,

12:03.598 --> 12:05.367
auction sites where
things like this get sold,

12:05.391 --> 12:07.599
but there is absolutely
no way in.

12:08.436 --> 12:10.723
I think you mean there's absolutely
no way in for <i>you.</i>

12:25.912 --> 12:27.904
Thought I'd find you here.

12:28.081 --> 12:29.492
I, um...

12:29.666 --> 12:31.032
<i>I looked into the, uh,</i>

12:31.876 --> 12:33.117
<i>burning cars
used in the heist.</i>

12:33.294 --> 12:34.330
<i>It's a dead end.</i>

12:35.004 --> 12:36.607
They were reported
stolen from neighborhoods

12:36.631 --> 12:37.462
miles apart.

12:37.632 --> 12:38.873
No connection.

12:39.092 --> 12:40.253
No luck on
my end either.

12:40.426 --> 12:41.426
Mm.

12:41.970 --> 12:43.711
SilverMark is
stonewalling us.

12:43.888 --> 12:44.924
Hey, Jane...

12:46.432 --> 12:47.432
<i>What happened?</i>

12:48.309 --> 12:49.641
In that room
back there?

12:52.438 --> 12:53.474
<i>It's just us.</i>

12:54.607 --> 12:55.893
Talk to me.

12:59.737 --> 13:01.228
I almost
held it together,

13:01.406 --> 13:02.406
until I...

13:03.700 --> 13:05.282
felt that blanket.

13:05.451 --> 13:06.942
What'd you remember?

13:07.120 --> 13:08.452
<i>When I was a kid,</i>

13:08.621 --> 13:12.365
there was this one
really cold morning.

13:12.542 --> 13:15.159
I crawled into
Shepherd's bed,

13:15.336 --> 13:17.168
which she never
let me do.

13:18.464 --> 13:19.830
But I wrapped up
in that blanket

13:20.008 --> 13:22.000
and I... I just...

13:22.176 --> 13:23.883
<i>curled up
right next to her.</i>

13:24.095 --> 13:26.257
<i>And it sounds crazy,
but, uh,</i>

13:26.639 --> 13:29.632
that was one of the happiest
moments of my life.

13:31.144 --> 13:33.511
<i>She knew how much
that blanket meant to me.</i>

13:33.646 --> 13:35.888
And she put it in there
for a reason.

13:36.065 --> 13:37.351
All of those things.

13:38.359 --> 13:39.645
And I think I know why.

13:40.361 --> 13:41.361
Why?

13:41.696 --> 13:43.336
I think that stash site
was supposed to be

13:43.406 --> 13:45.318
my recovery room.

13:45.491 --> 13:48.154
Touchstones to...
to shock my memory

13:48.328 --> 13:49.614
back into being Remi,

13:49.787 --> 13:51.278
once I had accomplished
my mission.

13:52.040 --> 13:53.747
So, you think...

13:54.375 --> 13:55.655
she thought that
it'd still work?

13:56.085 --> 13:57.085
I don't know.

13:57.128 --> 13:58.835
I mean, either that
or she just did it

13:59.047 --> 14:01.130
to torture me
one last time.

14:06.804 --> 14:08.136
Ah! Okay.

14:08.473 --> 14:09.589
<i>Thanks to this DIA list,</i>

14:09.766 --> 14:11.366
and my more important
deep web knowledge,

14:11.392 --> 14:13.475
we find ourselves
at an auction site

14:13.644 --> 14:15.977
with which I have more than
a passing familiarity.

14:16.147 --> 14:17.979
"XR1229."

14:18.149 --> 14:20.044
Greta's used those numbers
before with different letters.

14:20.068 --> 14:21.068
That's gotta be her.

14:21.444 --> 14:22.480
What do we got?

14:22.653 --> 14:24.465
Oh, just an out-of-the-way
corner of the dark web

14:24.489 --> 14:25.809
where our favorite
plutonium thief

14:25.907 --> 14:27.569
is about to do business...
the usual.

14:28.368 --> 14:29.825
<i>All right.
That's Greta.</i>

14:30.661 --> 14:32.994
"Looking to buy."

14:36.626 --> 14:37.626
Great, uh...

14:37.794 --> 14:39.786
<i>"Have funds."</i>

14:40.421 --> 14:41.912
She's not
taking the bait.

14:43.132 --> 14:45.294
<i>"I have what
you want to buy."</i>

14:45.551 --> 14:47.463
What?
Greta's buying?

14:47.637 --> 14:49.253
I thought she was selling
the plutonium.

14:51.182 --> 14:52.182
<i>Oh, no.</i>

14:52.558 --> 14:53.598
What do you mean,
"Oh, no?"

14:53.643 --> 14:55.350
If I'm correct,
and I for sure am,

14:55.686 --> 14:56.847
<i>GT and IMP are referring</i>

14:57.021 --> 14:58.557
to different types
of bomb casings.

14:58.731 --> 15:01.599
IMP in this context meaning
implosion device.

15:01.776 --> 15:03.176
That's what you put
the plutonium in

15:03.236 --> 15:04.397
to make a nuclear weapon.

15:06.656 --> 15:08.550
<i>Okay, she made the deal
but they're going private.</i>

15:08.574 --> 15:09.843
- Can we still monitor them?
<i>- Yes.</i>

15:09.867 --> 15:11.720
I just need to hitchhike
into their private chat.

15:11.744 --> 15:12.860
Shouldn't be an issue.

15:15.706 --> 15:17.572
Okay, that's
a bit of an issue.

15:17.750 --> 15:19.436
So now we don't know when
the deal will go down,

15:19.460 --> 15:21.340
where it'll happen,
or who she's gonna buy from.

15:21.462 --> 15:23.782
She's about to become the owner
of a fully functional nuke.

15:24.006 --> 15:25.122
<i>Dave, how bad is this?</i>

15:25.299 --> 15:26.360
Depending on
where it goes off,

15:26.384 --> 15:28.144
we're talking about thousands
of people dead.

15:28.386 --> 15:30.469
Hundreds of thousands, millions.

15:31.347 --> 15:34.181
So, Patterson,
it's very, very bad.

15:41.274 --> 15:44.267
Greta's about to take some
very dangerous chocolate

15:44.444 --> 15:46.777
and mix it with some very
radioactive peanut butter.

15:46.946 --> 15:49.029
You see, the plutonium
is our peanut butter,

15:49.240 --> 15:52.233
and the implosion device,
that is our chocolate, and when those...

15:52.410 --> 15:54.072
<i>All right, we...
we got it.</i>

15:54.745 --> 15:56.390
We need to figure out how
to get into this private chat

15:56.414 --> 15:58.100
to shut the deal down...
tell me you know something, Rich.

15:58.124 --> 15:58.910
<i>I'm working on it.</i>

15:59.000 --> 16:00.561
You said you knew
the ins and outs of this site.

16:00.585 --> 16:02.665
I used to be able to spy
on everything on this thing,

16:02.795 --> 16:03.956
<i>but, uh...</i>

16:06.090 --> 16:08.332
<i>And we're in! Ta-da!
I still got it.</i>

16:10.761 --> 16:12.923
Thanks to Rich,
we now have a place and time.

16:13.264 --> 16:14.755
Greta will attempt
to buy a device

16:14.932 --> 16:18.141
to weaponize her plutonium
today at the Caris Hotel.

16:18.352 --> 16:19.888
<i>And now we know
who our seller is.</i>

16:20.146 --> 16:22.012
Konstantin Valenov.

16:22.190 --> 16:24.557
A prominent
Russian businessman.

16:24.734 --> 16:26.128
We're still working out
the details of the bust,

16:26.152 --> 16:27.432
but, Weller,
you'll run the team.

16:27.612 --> 16:28.714
I have a feeling
this isn't gonna be as easy

16:28.738 --> 16:29.899
as kicking down a door.

16:30.072 --> 16:31.758
No, the bigger threat here
is the plutonium.

16:31.782 --> 16:32.989
<i>If I were Greta,</i>

16:33.159 --> 16:34.399
I wouldn't bring it
to the meet.

16:34.494 --> 16:35.512
I'd leave it somewhere safe.

16:35.536 --> 16:36.902
We gotta find it, so...

16:37.079 --> 16:38.519
why don't we let
the deal go through,

16:38.664 --> 16:40.621
and follow Greta
back to the plutonium.

16:40.791 --> 16:41.991
<i>And what if we lose her?</i>

16:42.043 --> 16:43.250
We just hope
that Valenov

16:43.419 --> 16:45.059
sells her a bomb casing
that doesn't work?

16:45.129 --> 16:46.586
What if it's not Valenov

16:46.756 --> 16:48.873
selling Greta
the malfunctioning device?

16:50.301 --> 16:51.301
What if it's us?

16:52.178 --> 16:53.259
What do you
have in mind?

16:53.429 --> 16:55.136
We intercept the device
presale,

16:55.306 --> 16:57.013
tamper with it,
rendering it useless...

16:57.183 --> 16:59.721
Dibs!
That's totally my area.

16:59.894 --> 17:01.055
I mean, that
is why I'm here.

17:01.229 --> 17:02.949
Ahem, look, Dave,
we appreciate your help...

17:03.022 --> 17:04.729
Does anybody else here
understand

17:04.898 --> 17:07.436
the technical intricacies
of more than 57

17:07.652 --> 17:09.063
implosion model
nuclear devices?

17:09.278 --> 17:10.609
More than 57?

17:10.780 --> 17:11.780
Anybody!

17:12.406 --> 17:14.238
Because I know 58.

17:18.037 --> 17:20.074
Okay, so Dave
disables the device,

17:20.248 --> 17:21.659
and we sell it to Greta.

17:21.832 --> 17:23.573
It probably has
tracking capabilities.

17:23.751 --> 17:25.538
I mean,
most nuclear devices do.

17:26.628 --> 17:29.497
Okay, so if Dave
can activate the tracker,

17:29.674 --> 17:31.006
<i>the team can lock onto it,</i>

17:31.175 --> 17:32.735
we'll follow that
back to the plutonium.

17:32.885 --> 17:34.421
All sounds well and good.

17:34.595 --> 17:36.302
Can I disable the device?
Sure.

17:36.472 --> 17:39.510
Can I manipulate the tracker?
Of course.

17:39.684 --> 17:41.095
But how do we do this?

17:41.394 --> 17:42.805
I think I know.

17:43.229 --> 17:44.248
If only there was some way

17:44.272 --> 17:46.355
I could demonstrate it
visually.

17:47.066 --> 17:49.103
Okay, so there's two rooms
in the hotel.

17:49.318 --> 17:51.230
Downstairs and upstairs.
Okay?

17:51.404 --> 17:53.566
Now we have
Patterson and Dave

17:53.739 --> 17:56.072
as Greta and her,
let's say, lackey,

17:56.242 --> 17:57.322
waiting on
the second floor.

17:57.451 --> 17:59.158
One floor down
from the real buyer.

17:59.328 --> 18:01.035
- <i>Exactly.</i>
- Now, why am I a peanut?

18:01.205 --> 18:02.432
Because you're not
part of the team.

18:02.456 --> 18:05.073
Saving me for the expansion.
Heh, smart.

18:05.251 --> 18:07.208
Yeah. Okay.
Now we have Valenov

18:07.378 --> 18:09.836
and the device coming down,
first floor,

18:10.006 --> 18:11.692
pressing the button
for the the third floor,

18:11.716 --> 18:13.833
but thanks to some patented
Rich Dotcom hackery,

18:13.968 --> 18:16.551
they're actually gonna make it
to the second floor,

18:16.721 --> 18:19.157
<i>where all the signs will have been
changed to maintain the deception.</i>

18:19.181 --> 18:21.298
Oh, so basically, <i>Mission Impossible:
Ghost Protocol.</i>

18:21.475 --> 18:23.203
- I don't know what that is.
- It's a great film.

18:23.227 --> 18:24.593
Tom Cruise does
all his own stunts.

18:24.770 --> 18:26.081
- Let's stay on track here.
<i>- Okay.</i>

18:26.105 --> 18:28.643
After we arrest Valenov...

18:28.816 --> 18:30.711
<i>"Oh, no, I can't believe,
you'll never take me alive.</i>

18:30.735 --> 18:32.522
All right,
I'll go peacefully."

18:32.737 --> 18:34.979
<i>Dave the Peanut will
tamper with the device,</i>

18:35.156 --> 18:36.442
rendering it useless,

18:36.616 --> 18:38.416
and then he'll bring it
up to the third floor,

18:38.659 --> 18:41.151
<i>where Kurt and Jane
will be waiting.</i>

18:41.495 --> 18:42.931
Now, the meeting's
supposed to start at 3:00,

18:42.955 --> 18:45.225
but, according to the chat,
if either party's late, the deal is off.

18:45.249 --> 18:48.162
All right, so we just have
to buy some more time upstairs,

18:48.336 --> 18:49.896
while Dave brings
the device downstairs.

18:49.920 --> 18:51.273
I know those systems
inside and out.

18:51.297 --> 18:52.378
It'll take me two seconds.

18:52.548 --> 18:53.859
Great, 'cause that's
how many you'll have.

18:53.883 --> 18:56.125
Okay, so that
is your mission,

18:56.302 --> 18:59.386
and apparently you have chosen
to accept said mission.

18:59.555 --> 19:00.555
So, good luck.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.226
Are you okay?

19:07.355 --> 19:09.517
Huh? Yeah.
I'm just, uh...

19:09.690 --> 19:11.022
trying to keep
my eye on the...

19:11.192 --> 19:12.312
unimaginably dangerous prize

19:12.485 --> 19:14.125
without thinking too much
about the people

19:14.278 --> 19:16.235
who are bringing
said prize to us.

19:16.405 --> 19:19.364
You said...
that you were pretty confident about this.

19:19.533 --> 19:20.773
Do we need to find
someone else?

19:20.910 --> 19:22.742
No. No, no, no, no.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.244
<i>This is not
my first rodeo.</i>

19:24.830 --> 19:26.947
I've been
to numerous rodeos.

19:27.792 --> 19:29.561
Should I close the door?
I'm gonna close the door.

19:29.585 --> 19:31.247
I'm... I'm closing the door.

19:31.420 --> 19:34.754
Okay, our life-size meatballs
are in their starting positions,

19:34.924 --> 19:37.632
and Patterson is in place,
getting her Greta face on.

19:37.843 --> 19:39.425
Weller, Jane,
you guys ready to go?

19:41.138 --> 19:42.800
We're set.

19:43.265 --> 19:44.265
<i>Okay, game on.</i>

19:44.558 --> 19:46.015
Uh, Valenov just got
on the elevator,

19:46.185 --> 19:48.065
<i>and he's pressed the button
for the third floor.</i>

19:48.270 --> 19:50.290
- <i>He's coming to you early, Patterson.
- Copy that.</i>

19:50.314 --> 19:52.055
Just gonna override
the system here,

19:52.400 --> 19:54.392
and he should get off
on the second floor.

19:55.695 --> 19:57.357
Okay, he got off.
It worked.

20:00.866 --> 20:02.698
You're here early.
I like that.

20:08.249 --> 20:09.456
<i>You're Greta?</i>

20:10.084 --> 20:11.325
Yep.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.044
Who's this?

20:13.504 --> 20:14.773
I wouldn't come
to a meeting like this

20:14.797 --> 20:17.255
- without my technical adviser.
- Muscle.

20:19.009 --> 20:20.170
Which is it?

20:21.137 --> 20:22.137
<i>He's kidding.</i>

20:22.221 --> 20:24.463
Clearly he's not...
the muscle.

20:24.640 --> 20:26.472
His strength
is his knowledge.

20:26.642 --> 20:27.849
Not that I couldn't,
of course.

20:28.060 --> 20:29.926
<i>Muscle stuff, that is.
Yeah, sure.</i>

20:30.104 --> 20:32.312
<i>Mostly I'm the, uh,
technical adviser, but, uh,</i>

20:32.481 --> 20:33.481
I do work out.

20:33.733 --> 20:36.350
Hit the gym...
nasium squats.

20:36.527 --> 20:38.143
Dave, you gotta
keep it together, man.

20:38.320 --> 20:39.756
<i>You'll have to excuse
my associate.</i>

20:39.780 --> 20:42.693
<i>He's aces with
high-tech weaponry.</i>

20:43.242 --> 20:45.484
But he has a little bit
too much of an appetite

20:45.661 --> 20:47.072
for recreational powders.

20:51.584 --> 20:53.291
Greta, I understand
a couple of years ago

20:53.461 --> 20:55.453
you did business with
my old friend Yuri.

20:56.046 --> 20:57.162
<i>Yuri?</i>

20:58.048 --> 20:59.048
Yuri...

20:59.467 --> 21:00.587
I'm searching!
Just a second!

21:00.801 --> 21:02.362
Patterson really needs
the answer now, Rich.

21:02.386 --> 21:05.754
Okay, uh, Yuri, Yuri.
The... Gardener.

21:05.890 --> 21:07.131
No, Butcher!
Yuri the Butcher!

21:07.308 --> 21:08.844
Sorry.
My Russian's a little rusty.

21:10.269 --> 21:12.135
Yuri the Butcher.

21:12.605 --> 21:15.143
Yes. How is Yuri?

21:16.317 --> 21:17.853
Uh, hang on.

21:18.527 --> 21:19.688
Oh, dead! Super dead!

21:19.862 --> 21:23.276
Ha! Okay. Oh, murdered
in a very gruesome fashion.

21:23.449 --> 21:25.135
And, according to
the authorities, his killer

21:25.159 --> 21:26.553
is most likely standing
right in front of you.

21:26.577 --> 21:27.988
So... that's fun.

21:28.579 --> 21:29.615
Why don't you tell me?

21:29.789 --> 21:31.309
You were the last one
to see him alive.

21:35.544 --> 21:37.410
Now, are we gonna
do this or not?

21:38.422 --> 21:39.422
Of course.

21:56.774 --> 21:57.890
It's the real thing.

21:58.067 --> 21:59.067
Alpha Team, move in.

21:59.360 --> 22:00.360
Freeze!

22:00.402 --> 22:01.402
FBI!

22:04.365 --> 22:06.231
<i>Hey, Dave!</i>

22:06.408 --> 22:07.408
Get up!
Get to work!

22:07.576 --> 22:08.942
<i>Two seconds, remember?</i>

22:14.416 --> 22:15.416
Right on time.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.246
My partner likes that.

22:17.419 --> 22:18.705
Uh, your partner?

22:18.879 --> 22:20.666
I'll tell him
you're here.

22:35.145 --> 22:37.933
Of all the people who
could have walked in here.

22:45.948 --> 22:47.780
It's good to see you
again, Remi.

22:48.826 --> 22:49.826
<i>Yeah.</i>

22:52.204 --> 22:53.536
Cameron Gibbs.

22:53.706 --> 22:55.663
I wasn't sure
you'd remember me.

23:01.130 --> 23:02.541
I can't believe
it's actually you.

23:02.715 --> 23:04.484
This is that hell-raiser
I was telling you about

23:04.508 --> 23:05.748
from when I worked
for Shepherd.

23:05.801 --> 23:06.541
I mean, Remi pulled off

23:06.719 --> 23:08.238
some of the craziest jobs
I've ever seen.

23:08.262 --> 23:09.423
I did my best.

23:09.597 --> 23:10.824
I always wondered
what happened with you

23:10.848 --> 23:12.259
after it all fell apart.

23:13.392 --> 23:14.872
It looks like
you landed on your feet.

23:15.144 --> 23:17.024
<i>There are worse things
than working for Valenov.</i>

23:17.479 --> 23:19.266
I hate to break up
this reunion,

23:19.440 --> 23:20.476
but I've gotta say,

23:20.649 --> 23:22.481
I don't like this
coincidence one bit.

23:23.694 --> 23:25.276
I appreciate
the concern.

23:25.446 --> 23:27.062
You and I go back
four months.

23:27.281 --> 23:28.738
She and I go back years.

23:29.116 --> 23:30.778
<i>Wouldn't be who I am
without Remi.</i>

23:31.035 --> 23:33.698
When I was at my lowest,
when I lost everything...

23:34.079 --> 23:36.787
this woman
helped me through.

23:37.207 --> 23:38.869
<i>And I trust her
with my life.</i>

23:39.793 --> 23:40.793
And yours.

23:41.086 --> 23:42.526
We should talk
about this in private.

23:42.630 --> 23:43.648
There's nothing
to talk about.

23:43.672 --> 23:44.752
<i>No, it... no, no, no.</i>

23:44.798 --> 23:46.943
If she needs to talk things through
to feel good about this,

23:46.967 --> 23:48.583
<i>by all means,
go and talk.</i>

23:48.802 --> 23:50.338
Whatever makes
this sale happen.

23:50.971 --> 23:53.088
Always the pragmatist.
Okay.

23:53.432 --> 23:54.432
<i>Let's talk.</i>

24:02.524 --> 24:04.015
Do you wanna explain
what's going on?

24:06.570 --> 24:09.404
He used to be in the army,
just a regular family guy.

24:09.740 --> 24:11.697
<i>But Shepherd had
other plans for him.</i>

24:12.117 --> 24:14.109
And she, uh, needed
someone to set him up

24:14.286 --> 24:15.948
and to manipulate him.

24:16.121 --> 24:17.532
To this day,
he doesn't really know

24:17.665 --> 24:19.702
<i>who was actually
pulling the strings.</i>

24:20.209 --> 24:21.209
<i>Shepherd.</i>

24:21.418 --> 24:22.909
No... me.

24:23.921 --> 24:24.921
Remi.

24:25.089 --> 24:26.955
She turned him
into a murderer.

24:27.216 --> 24:28.798
Okay, I can
in fact confirm

24:28.968 --> 24:30.925
<i>that this Cameron Gibbs
is a very bad guy.</i>

24:31.095 --> 24:32.781
<i>He's responsible
for a number of attacks</i>

24:32.805 --> 24:34.445
on military targets
all across the country

24:34.598 --> 24:35.634
<i>in the past few years.</i>

24:35.808 --> 24:37.219
So what happened
with you two?

24:37.393 --> 24:39.680
Well, when I was Remi,
as part of an op,

24:39.853 --> 24:42.721
I needed access to
confidential military files.

24:43.107 --> 24:44.348
<i>Gibbs was a pencil-pusher</i>

24:44.525 --> 24:46.044
<i>at the Army office
where they were kept,</i>

24:46.068 --> 24:49.607
so I lifted his I.D.
and I stole the files.

24:50.114 --> 24:52.777
He got blamed
and dishonorably discharged.

24:53.075 --> 24:55.317
He never knew it was me.

24:55.494 --> 24:57.030
That's why he hates
the military.

24:57.204 --> 24:59.412
Yeah, but that's
not all of it.

24:59.581 --> 25:02.244
<i>After he was discharged,
I recruited him.</i>

25:02.626 --> 25:04.788
I turned his hate
to Sandstorm's advantage.

25:04.962 --> 25:07.625
I created a monster.

25:07.798 --> 25:09.835
Remi may have
pushed him.

25:10.384 --> 25:13.843
But at some point...
he made a choice.

25:17.725 --> 25:19.933
Patterson,
what's taking so long?

25:20.102 --> 25:21.342
<i>We've got a problem.</i>

25:21.854 --> 25:22.854
Huh...

25:23.063 --> 25:24.645
This is not the time
for "huh," Dave.

25:25.315 --> 25:26.626
<i>Jane and Weller are
treading water upstairs.</i>

25:26.650 --> 25:27.811
<i>We need
to figure this out.</i>

25:27.985 --> 25:29.851
Well, this is not
at all what I was expecting.

25:30.029 --> 25:31.145
It's not one of the 58.

25:31.655 --> 25:33.897
The circuitry
is all different.

25:34.742 --> 25:36.404
<i>This must be a...
a newer model</i>

25:36.577 --> 25:38.221
<i>than the one they were
talking about in the chat room.</i>

25:38.245 --> 25:39.281
<i>I get the confusion.</i>

25:39.413 --> 25:40.574
Most people
don't even know

25:40.748 --> 25:42.034
what generation iPad
they have.

25:42.207 --> 25:43.207
Dave!

25:43.333 --> 25:44.540
You need to hurry.

25:44.752 --> 25:47.085
Fine. Jeez.
You're not making it any easier.

25:47.254 --> 25:49.496
<i>Weller, Jane,
you guys are gonna have to stall.</i>

25:52.968 --> 25:55.756
While I appreciate
my partner's concerns,

25:55.929 --> 25:58.763
we have talked it over
and ultimately we have decided

25:58.932 --> 26:01.299
to move forward
with this transaction.

26:01.727 --> 26:02.727
Let's see what ya got.

26:03.479 --> 26:04.970
I appreciate your eagerness,

26:05.147 --> 26:06.827
but it's been a while,
since I've seen you,

26:06.899 --> 26:08.376
and I need to make sure
I'm still dealing with

26:08.400 --> 26:09.811
<i>the same man I used to know.</i>

26:10.152 --> 26:12.018
Sounds like a great
excuse for a drink.

26:12.446 --> 26:13.446
<i>Mm.</i>

26:16.658 --> 26:18.320
That's a fantastic idea.

26:18.494 --> 26:20.638
Can you disable this thing
and activate the tracker or not?

26:20.662 --> 26:23.029
- Huh...
- This is a "no huh" zone right now!

26:23.248 --> 26:25.928
<i>Sooner or later, those guys upstairs are
gonna wanna see this thing,</i>

26:25.959 --> 26:28.292
and when they do,
Jane and Weller need to be holding it.

26:28.462 --> 26:30.294
To turn off the explosive
ignition element,

26:30.672 --> 26:31.832
I need to disable
the tracker.

26:31.882 --> 26:32.882
<i>Or vice-versa.</i>

26:32.966 --> 26:34.277
<i>I can do one,
but I can't do both.</i>

26:34.301 --> 26:36.634
Fine. Disable the tracker.

26:36.804 --> 26:38.404
We'll find Greta's plutonium
another way.

26:38.472 --> 26:41.886
And Remi says, "I told you
it'd cost an arm and a leg."

26:47.648 --> 26:50.140
The look on that
guy's face.

26:52.569 --> 26:54.526
All right.
Enough war stories.

26:54.988 --> 26:56.229
We good?

26:56.406 --> 26:58.068
<i>Can we do what
we all came here to do.</i>

26:58.534 --> 26:59.900
<i>I don't see why not.</i>

27:01.578 --> 27:03.681
So what are you planning
to do with that thing, anyway?

27:03.705 --> 27:04.865
<i>None of your business.</i>

27:06.416 --> 27:07.532
Let's see it.

27:08.710 --> 27:09.710
<i>Okay.</i>

27:10.879 --> 27:12.996
Let me, uh,
set up the transfer.

27:13.382 --> 27:15.214
Verify that the funds
are there.

27:16.218 --> 27:18.175
Yeah. Be my guest.

27:18.345 --> 27:19.381
Let's get it moving.

27:19.555 --> 27:20.555
Great.

27:20.848 --> 27:24.262
It's just...
about done.

27:24.852 --> 27:26.935
Okay, so...

27:27.563 --> 27:30.897
Entering my account details.

27:31.608 --> 27:33.065
Uh, now...

27:33.277 --> 27:34.438
I need yours.

27:43.370 --> 27:44.611
<i>Verifying now.</i>

27:46.373 --> 27:48.330
The Wi-Fi in this place
is terrible.

27:48.500 --> 27:49.500
Wi-Fi. On it.

27:49.668 --> 27:50.909
Okay. Terrible
Wi-Fi connection

27:51.086 --> 27:52.452
coming right up.

27:54.548 --> 27:55.548
Oh...

27:56.133 --> 27:59.092
Sorry, but I think
that's the culprit.

27:59.678 --> 28:02.091
<i>I never know how
to get rid of these things.</i>

28:02.890 --> 28:03.721
Do you guys?

28:03.891 --> 28:04.971
You ever
think about getting

28:05.100 --> 28:06.466
a separate computer
for work?

28:06.685 --> 28:08.051
<i>The Eagle is about to land.</i>

28:08.228 --> 28:09.435
This is taking
too long.

28:10.022 --> 28:11.374
<i>Well, if you were helping me,</i>

28:11.398 --> 28:14.186
<i>I mean, you know, things might
go a little faster. Sorry.</i>

28:14.359 --> 28:16.159
Maybe if you tried
quitting out of everything.

28:16.195 --> 28:17.561
Yep. Good call.

28:19.156 --> 28:21.239
<i>And the moment of truth.</i>

28:23.452 --> 28:25.660
There you go.
Funds are verified.

28:25.829 --> 28:28.037
Let's see the device.

28:33.921 --> 28:36.709
Wow. Hope it works
as good as it looks.

28:36.882 --> 28:39.152
<i>Just a reminder,
the tracking device does not work,</i>

28:39.176 --> 28:40.361
so it won't be able
to track it back

28:40.385 --> 28:42.065
to wherever Gibbs
is keeping the plutonium.

28:42.596 --> 28:43.596
We want in.

28:44.848 --> 28:45.848
What?

28:46.600 --> 28:48.240
<i>Working for Valenov
pays the bills,</i>

28:48.352 --> 28:50.192
but it's been too long
since I've been on a job

28:50.229 --> 28:51.891
that actually
meant something.

28:52.356 --> 28:53.767
Whatever you have planned,

28:54.233 --> 28:55.394
I wanna be
a part of it.

28:55.943 --> 28:57.150
<i>For old times' sake.</i>

28:57.319 --> 28:59.732
Gibbs... no.

29:04.952 --> 29:06.113
<i>"Old times' sake."</i>

29:07.537 --> 29:10.154
I used to idolize you.
Do you know that?

29:11.291 --> 29:13.157
<i>It would be an honor
to have you along</i>

29:13.377 --> 29:14.959
<i>for what I have planned
today.</i>

29:18.382 --> 29:19.463
This is heavy.

29:20.384 --> 29:21.841
Remi, you come with me.

29:22.177 --> 29:25.841
Finish up the transaction.
Meet at the rendezvous.

29:28.183 --> 29:29.594
We'll take the stairs.

29:29.726 --> 29:31.446
Why not the elevator...
it'd be a lot easier

29:31.520 --> 29:32.727
than carrying
that thing down.

29:32.896 --> 29:33.998
I never go through
the main lobby.

29:34.022 --> 29:35.022
Too many eyes.

29:35.607 --> 29:37.690
<i>No one ever watches
the service stairs.</i>

29:37.859 --> 29:40.693
Plus, I lifted the keys from the janitor,
so I could slip out.

29:40.862 --> 29:42.465
That being said,
would you check in there?

29:42.489 --> 29:45.448
See if there's a dolly
or a hand cart we could use?

29:48.829 --> 29:49.829
Uhh!

29:50.622 --> 29:51.622
Hey!

29:54.084 --> 29:55.245
What are you doing?

29:55.419 --> 29:56.455
The plan was to kill

29:56.628 --> 29:58.188
whoever showed up
to sell us that thing.

29:58.213 --> 30:00.125
<i>Cleaner that way.
You taught me that.</i>

30:00.924 --> 30:02.540
But I could never kill you.

30:02.718 --> 30:04.318
Yeah, well, let me out.
I can still help.

30:04.469 --> 30:07.052
No. Sorry about your partner.
He seemed nice.

30:07.931 --> 30:08.971
What are you
talking about?

30:09.016 --> 30:10.348
Well,
I don't know him.

30:10.475 --> 30:11.841
I can't take
that risk.

30:12.019 --> 30:13.260
Neither can Greta.

30:17.691 --> 30:20.149
Kurt... Kurt,
Greta's coming for you.

30:22.279 --> 30:23.399
<i>Kurt, can you hear me?</i>

30:23.572 --> 30:25.564
<i>Greta... Kurt...</i>

30:40.839 --> 30:41.839
Gibbs got away.

30:41.882 --> 30:43.214
But Dave sabotaged
the device.

30:43.675 --> 30:45.111
So Gibbs doesn't have
a working nuke.

30:45.135 --> 30:46.404
Yeah, he'll figure that out
soon enough, though.

30:46.428 --> 30:47.989
When he realizes
the device doesn't work,

30:48.013 --> 30:49.373
a guy like that'll know
he can make

30:49.431 --> 30:51.351
one heck of a dirty bomb
with all that plutonium.

30:51.558 --> 30:54.016
Can Gibbs really improvise
a dirty bomb that quickly?

30:54.186 --> 30:56.247
I mean, the guy, he likes
exploding things that much,

30:56.271 --> 30:58.249
I'm sure he's got something
on hand to build it with.

30:58.273 --> 31:00.513
We gotta find him... Weller,
you gotta get Greta talking.

31:01.068 --> 31:02.730
All right, so what
is the target?

31:02.903 --> 31:03.903
Go to hell.

31:03.987 --> 31:05.353
Why are you
protecting him?

31:05.530 --> 31:07.522
You've only known Gibbs
for a few months.

31:07.699 --> 31:10.988
Gibbs is going to kill
a lot of innocent people.

31:11.161 --> 31:12.868
Do you really want
to be a part of that?

31:13.038 --> 31:14.279
<i>What you do right now</i>

31:14.456 --> 31:16.216
has everything to do
with how you'll be tried

31:16.416 --> 31:17.416
when this is over.

31:21.797 --> 31:22.797
I was just helping

31:22.923 --> 31:24.585
with the deal
and the getaway.

31:24.716 --> 31:26.628
What he does in between,
that's on him.

31:26.843 --> 31:28.800
Greta, if you
work with us right now...

31:29.179 --> 31:31.136
the FBI will
take that into account.

31:31.473 --> 31:33.886
This is years of your life
you're playing with, Greta.

31:35.602 --> 31:36.308
We're supposed to meet

31:36.478 --> 31:38.720
in front of the Howard
building in Queens.

31:38.897 --> 31:41.014
Okay, Rich, Gibbs said
the attack is gonna be today

31:41.191 --> 31:42.602
<i>and that he's
settling a score.</i>

31:42.776 --> 31:44.087
All right, and we know
that his main beef

31:44.111 --> 31:45.147
is with the military.

31:45.320 --> 31:46.339
Put those
two things together

31:46.363 --> 31:47.820
with the rendezvous point
in Queens.

31:47.989 --> 31:49.480
Oh, okay.
I got it! Uh...

31:49.658 --> 31:51.135
There's an event
honoring the military

31:51.159 --> 31:52.279
<i>at the Hutton Center
tonight.</i>

31:52.411 --> 31:53.868
<i>It's gonna be packed.</i>

31:54.037 --> 31:55.139
<i>And look who
the guest of honor is.</i>

31:55.163 --> 31:56.574
It's gonna be
Colonel Alan Spiegel.

31:56.790 --> 31:58.782
He's the man who signed
Gibbs' discharge papers.

31:58.959 --> 31:59.699
<i>Oh, and then there's this.</i>

31:59.876 --> 32:01.458
<i>A construction truck
full of debris</i>

32:01.628 --> 32:03.745
was just reported stolen
from right near the venue.

32:03.922 --> 32:06.255
That gives Gibbs everything
he needs to make a dirty bomb.

32:06.425 --> 32:07.905
<i>The event's starting soon.</i>

32:08.093 --> 32:09.737
Wait, the Hutton Center's
just around the corner.

32:09.761 --> 32:11.322
That blast is gonna kill
a lot of people.

32:11.346 --> 32:12.962
There'll be
nuclear fallout for miles.

32:13.098 --> 32:14.930
Let's move.
Frank, you take her in.

32:20.564 --> 32:22.271
I caused this.

32:22.441 --> 32:23.807
This is my fault.

32:25.444 --> 32:28.187
Just... put that
out of your head.

32:28.738 --> 32:30.007
Okay? There's too much
at stake here.

32:30.031 --> 32:32.068
No, I didn't just ruin
one man's life, I've...

32:33.368 --> 32:35.405
I've endangered
thousands of others.

32:35.579 --> 32:37.571
No, Jane, that wasn't you.

32:37.747 --> 32:39.613
If I don't start
taking responsibility

32:39.791 --> 32:42.158
for the things
that Remi did,

32:42.294 --> 32:44.206
I don't know what's
going to happen to me.

32:46.715 --> 32:48.568
<i>Just a heads-up,
The Hutton Center will not,</i>

32:48.592 --> 32:50.254
I repeat, will not
be evacuated.

32:50.427 --> 32:51.668
Even though
the clock's ticking,

32:51.887 --> 32:53.364
local PD doesn't want
to cause mass panic.

32:53.388 --> 32:54.908
<i>Or tip Gibbs off
and detonate the bomb.</i>

32:55.056 --> 32:56.843
And if an explosion
does happen soon,

32:57.017 --> 32:58.857
it won't really matter
if they evacuate or not.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.329
<i>All right,
so we gotta stop him.</i>

33:00.353 --> 33:01.353
Almost there.

33:06.526 --> 33:08.438
We should split up.

33:08.653 --> 33:09.653
Cover more ground.

33:10.238 --> 33:11.238
I'll take upstairs.

33:57.410 --> 33:58.571
<i>Don't move!</i>

33:59.538 --> 34:01.370
<i>Gibbs, just listen.</i>

34:01.540 --> 34:02.872
You sold me a dud!

34:03.667 --> 34:04.667
<i>You played me!</i>

34:05.752 --> 34:07.163
Why are you
doing this?

34:07.337 --> 34:09.454
I'm hoping nobody else
has to die today.

34:11.007 --> 34:12.714
What happened to you?

34:13.927 --> 34:14.927
<i>Who are you?</i>

34:15.094 --> 34:16.677
Jane!
Tell me where you are!

34:17.347 --> 34:18.838
Put down the detonator.

34:19.014 --> 34:21.007
<i>Let's leave the service tunnel
and work this out.</i>

34:21.184 --> 34:22.846
Service tunnel.
Got it!

34:23.018 --> 34:24.885
<i>We're not going anywhere.</i>

34:25.272 --> 34:27.103
There's only one way
outta here now.

34:27.440 --> 34:28.851
That's not true.

34:29.025 --> 34:31.141
I know what you're trying
to do and why.

34:31.735 --> 34:33.272
<i>But think about all
the innocent people</i>

34:33.446 --> 34:34.902
that are going to die.

34:35.072 --> 34:37.030
They are not just
collateral damage.

34:38.326 --> 34:39.942
Collateral damage?

34:40.120 --> 34:42.703
The Army didn't care
about collateral damage

34:42.998 --> 34:44.739
when they ruined my life!

34:45.083 --> 34:48.246
<i>The Remi I know would've
cheered me on for this.</i>

34:48.878 --> 34:49.914
You've changed.

34:50.088 --> 34:51.454
So can you, Gibbs.

34:51.590 --> 34:53.252
Army was all
that I cared about.

34:53.425 --> 34:54.705
When I got blamed
for everything,

34:54.842 --> 34:57.085
no one, no one,
not even my family

34:57.429 --> 35:00.342
believed that I was innocent,
no one except you.

35:00.807 --> 35:02.173
<i>You gave me a new purpose.</i>

35:02.350 --> 35:04.842
You told me,
"Make them pay."

35:05.520 --> 35:07.011
Would your family want this?

35:07.355 --> 35:10.223
My family!
I'm dead to them already.

35:18.074 --> 35:19.610
You can't detonate
that bomb.

35:20.035 --> 35:21.116
Why's that?

35:22.454 --> 35:24.320
Because the Army
didn't do this to you.

35:24.664 --> 35:26.371
Jane, no!
Don't say it!

35:27.167 --> 35:28.203
It was me.

35:35.425 --> 35:37.257
What do you mean,
you did this to me?

35:38.094 --> 35:39.801
I took your access codes.

35:39.971 --> 35:41.507
I stole the classified
documents.

35:41.640 --> 35:43.051
I got you fired.

35:44.184 --> 35:44.844
No.

35:45.018 --> 35:47.351
And when I saw how far
you'd fallen,

35:47.479 --> 35:49.766
I knew you'd be
useful to Shepherd.

35:52.067 --> 35:53.183
You're lying.

35:53.360 --> 35:54.646
<i>I befriended you.</i>

35:55.570 --> 35:57.436
I groomed you.

35:57.822 --> 35:58.938
I recruited you.

35:59.532 --> 36:01.945
<i>I was your problem
and your solution.</i>

36:02.160 --> 36:05.779
<i>I am the one
who ruined your life,</i>

36:06.122 --> 36:07.579
not the Army...

36:07.749 --> 36:11.333
and not those people
at the ceremony upstairs.

36:12.545 --> 36:13.665
Why are you telling me this?

36:14.089 --> 36:16.627
Because I was a different
person back then.

36:17.634 --> 36:20.172
I did terrible things.

36:21.137 --> 36:23.504
<i>And I made a decision
to change.</i>

36:23.973 --> 36:25.339
<i>To be better.</i>

36:25.809 --> 36:30.144
Cameron, it is not
too late to be better.

36:30.772 --> 36:33.310
To correct the mistakes
of the past.

36:37.362 --> 36:38.398
You lied.

36:39.197 --> 36:40.404
<i>For years.</i>

36:41.574 --> 36:42.860
You...

36:43.368 --> 36:45.155
You were my friend.

36:46.871 --> 36:48.658
No, I wasn't.

36:49.749 --> 36:51.866
It's me
you wanna hurt...

36:52.460 --> 36:53.792
not them.

36:54.003 --> 36:55.039
<i>You're right.</i>

36:56.715 --> 36:58.377
I do wanna hurt you.

37:02.554 --> 37:04.194
And it sounds like
the best way to do that

37:04.222 --> 37:06.054
is for you to die knowing
that you killed me

37:06.224 --> 37:07.504
and all the people
upstairs, too.

37:07.559 --> 37:08.766
No. No, I can help you.

37:29.038 --> 37:30.279
All right.

37:30.498 --> 37:32.330
<i>Okay.</i>

37:32.792 --> 37:34.283
<i>We're good to go.</i>

37:36.755 --> 37:38.462
How you holding up?

37:42.427 --> 37:44.464
I don't know
if I can do this.

37:46.514 --> 37:48.005
<i>I thought I could, uh...</i>

37:48.808 --> 37:50.595
close the door on my past.

37:51.478 --> 37:52.810
Quarantine it.

37:53.521 --> 37:54.728
But I can't.

37:56.024 --> 37:57.981
You just gotta
keep fighting.

37:59.235 --> 38:00.351
Keep trying.

38:00.570 --> 38:03.984
I'm so tired, Kurt.

38:05.200 --> 38:07.283
I'm tired of fighting.

38:07.869 --> 38:11.533
Tired of trying,
tired of... remembering.

38:12.916 --> 38:14.873
I just wanna forget.

38:16.169 --> 38:17.330
Hey...

38:20.507 --> 38:21.668
Come here.

38:22.967 --> 38:25.175
Shh, shh, shh.

38:27.055 --> 38:28.365
<i>Any new leads
on Madeline's whereabouts</i>

38:28.389 --> 38:30.176
- or what she's planning?
- Not yet.

38:30.767 --> 38:31.598
But the night is young.

38:31.768 --> 38:33.225
What about
Keaton's USB drive?

38:36.856 --> 38:37.856
<i>What's wrong?</i>

38:38.608 --> 38:40.190
The file doesn't exonerate
both of us.

38:40.360 --> 38:41.567
It just clears me.

38:42.445 --> 38:44.277
<i>I was the one crossing
the lines out there</i>

38:44.405 --> 38:46.692
doing what I thought
I had to for the mission.

38:46.866 --> 38:49.404
But he claims I was
blindly following him,

38:49.577 --> 38:51.534
and he was calling
all the shots.

38:51.913 --> 38:54.030
Why would he fall
on his sword like that?

38:54.582 --> 38:55.789
My guess,
maybe he realized

38:55.959 --> 38:57.666
how much damage
he was doing to your life.

38:57.836 --> 38:59.122
<i>He put you through hell.</i>

39:00.171 --> 39:01.690
Maybe that was starting
to weigh on him,

39:01.714 --> 39:03.046
and he wants
to make it right.

39:09.055 --> 39:11.422
<i>Okay, pretty sure
visiting hours are over.</i>

39:12.350 --> 39:13.761
Just here to say
one thing.

39:13.977 --> 39:15.843
<i>Well, that doesn't sound good.</i>

39:16.020 --> 39:17.511
Thanks, but no thanks.

39:18.398 --> 39:20.139
I won't let you
sacrifice yourself for me.

39:20.316 --> 39:22.478
- Look, Tasha, I...
- Keaton, shut up!

39:22.652 --> 39:24.018
It was my choice
to go undercover

39:24.237 --> 39:25.648
and work off the books.

39:26.531 --> 39:28.363
You didn't make me
do anything.

39:28.533 --> 39:29.865
And I won't be
responsible for you

39:30.034 --> 39:31.821
getting thrown in prison
or somewhere worse.

39:31.953 --> 39:34.240
As if either of you
has much say.

39:35.832 --> 39:37.664
I'm gonna clear
both of our names

39:37.792 --> 39:38.908
by taking Madeline down

39:39.127 --> 39:40.618
and getting the truth
out of her.

39:40.837 --> 39:42.328
So you just focus
on resting up

39:42.547 --> 39:43.583
and getting strong.

39:44.924 --> 39:45.924
Good night.

39:46.759 --> 39:49.593
Hey. That was more
than one thing.

39:50.930 --> 39:51.716
You coming?

39:51.890 --> 39:52.971
Give us a minute.

39:56.811 --> 39:58.038
We need to get
something straight.

39:58.062 --> 40:00.270
Okay, this is not restful.

40:00.648 --> 40:02.935
Keeping me in the dark
when Zapata was out there,

40:03.151 --> 40:04.642
lying to my face about it...

40:05.987 --> 40:08.604
I get it's the job,
it's part of the business.

40:09.657 --> 40:11.364
<i>But it felt pretty damn
personal to me.</i>

40:11.534 --> 40:12.570
It was.

40:13.453 --> 40:14.864
Excuse me?

40:15.038 --> 40:16.404
It was personal.

40:17.248 --> 40:18.830
I didn't loop you in
because I knew you,

40:19.083 --> 40:21.666
of all people, would be able
to talk her out of it.

40:21.794 --> 40:24.161
Have you met the woman?
No one can talk her out of anything.

40:24.255 --> 40:27.373
You word carries more weight
than you think.

40:27.550 --> 40:29.883
But I think part of you
probably knows that.

40:34.098 --> 40:35.098
Welcome back, Keaton.

40:35.266 --> 40:36.266
Thank you.

40:42.398 --> 40:44.435
"Very not good.

40:44.567 --> 40:45.853
Ambushed by henchmen."

40:46.361 --> 40:48.041
<i>- Better make that roll.</i>
- Okay, all right.

40:48.112 --> 40:50.445
Well, what do I need?
Between a 14...

40:50.615 --> 40:52.356
and the symbol for Gemini?

40:53.576 --> 40:54.783
- Ah...
- Almost.

40:54.953 --> 40:56.319
Wait, okay.
I got a commendation

40:56.496 --> 40:57.532
from the bigwigs card.

40:57.705 --> 40:59.241
It's not enough.
I still get tied up

40:59.415 --> 41:00.535
and lose a turn
at the Docks.

41:00.583 --> 41:01.583
<i>- Brutal.</i>
- Yes!

41:01.709 --> 41:02.709
Okay, your go.

41:03.753 --> 41:05.210
So that is a 14.

41:05.380 --> 41:09.545
And I'm gonna use my
"Help from a Deep-Web contact."

41:10.843 --> 41:12.379
That makes 17.

41:12.845 --> 41:13.845
Did I solve it?

41:13.888 --> 41:15.299
Ah, you cracked the tattoo!

41:15.515 --> 41:17.131
You know what,
this is actually

41:17.308 --> 41:19.550
a pretty decent game.

41:19.727 --> 41:21.093
- Oh, really?
<i>- Um...</i>

41:21.646 --> 41:22.477
I'm impressed.

41:22.647 --> 41:24.183
I will pass that on
to the designer.

41:24.899 --> 41:26.099
Oh, and you know what?
I, uh...

41:26.150 --> 41:28.642
I found this lying around.
I thought you might want it.

41:30.822 --> 41:33.155
Hey, no more melty face.

41:33.324 --> 41:34.986
And you're still
taller than Weller.

41:38.204 --> 41:40.224
<i>NYPD finally gave us access
to the security cam</i>

41:40.248 --> 41:41.784
outside the Sandstorm hideout.

41:42.250 --> 41:43.250
<i>Uh, let me run a program</i>

41:43.334 --> 41:44.694
to see if there's
been any activity

41:44.752 --> 41:45.993
the last few weeks.

41:47.588 --> 41:49.170
<i>Oh, mysterious hooded figure.</i>

41:49.340 --> 41:51.127
Dramatic much?
Who the hell is that?

41:51.300 --> 41:52.416
<i>I don't know.</i>

41:53.302 --> 41:54.662
They must have the same
kind of key

41:54.804 --> 41:55.920
Shepherd gave to Jane.

41:57.223 --> 41:58.054
According to
the timestamp,

41:58.224 --> 42:00.064
this was taken just before
we raided the place.

42:00.101 --> 42:01.637
<i>Is that an old member
of Sandstorm?</i>

42:01.811 --> 42:04.554
Whoever it is, we must
have just missed them.

42:38.598 --> 42:39.759
Greg, move your head!

42:40.305 --> 42:46.711
