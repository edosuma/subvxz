00:05.054 --> 00:07.422
Mmm. What have we here?

00:07.490 --> 00:08.757
Yecch!

00:08.825 --> 00:11.426
Does he have to put carrots
in everything?

00:11.494 --> 00:13.195
- What are you doing?
- Aah!

00:14.430 --> 00:17.632
Nyah. That wasn't
an overreaction.

You know, that pie was for
tonight's dinner party.

00:44.060 --> 00:45.827
- What dinner party?
- You're kidding.

00:45.895 --> 00:49.197
- What?
- Uh, the dinner party we're having

00:49.265 --> 00:52.167
so you can apologize
to all of our neighbors?

00:52.235 --> 00:53.935
What do I have
to apologize for?

00:54.003 --> 00:56.938
How about for what you did
on the fourth of July?

00:57.006 --> 00:59.374
Happy fourth of July!

["1812 Overture" playing]

01:06.749 --> 01:08.116
Hey, freedom isn't free.

01:08.184 --> 01:10.852
And for what you did on Easter.

01:10.920 --> 01:12.854
Happy Easter!

["1812 Overture" playing]

What the--

01:18.327 --> 01:19.461
Aah!

01:19.529 --> 01:20.829
I don't know
what the big deal was.

01:20.897 --> 01:22.297
They were cage-free eggs.

01:22.365 --> 01:25.367
And for what you did
on Columbus Day.

01:25.435 --> 01:27.102
Happy Columbus Day!
[Squeaking]

01:27.170 --> 01:29.571
["1812 Overture" playing]

01:31.441 --> 01:33.108
What? The rats represented

01:33.176 --> 01:35.243
the "Niña," the "Pinta,"
and the "Santa María."

01:35.311 --> 01:38.013
If they didn't get it,
that's their problem.

01:38.080 --> 01:40.649
Besides, what do you care
if the neighbors hate me?

01:40.716 --> 01:43.518
I care
because this is my house,

01:43.586 --> 01:44.953
and one of these days,

01:45.021 --> 01:48.256
one of the neighbors is going
to file a lawsuit against me

01:48.324 --> 01:50.392
for something that you did.

01:50.460 --> 01:51.560
Relax.

01:51.627 --> 01:53.462
It's not like I'm going
to live here forever.

01:53.529 --> 01:57.199
If you're so worried
about getting sued,

01:57.266 --> 01:59.434
I'll apologize.

01:59.502 --> 02:00.836
But come on.

02:00.903 --> 02:04.473
Have a little faith
in our neighbors.

02:07.743 --> 02:08.910
Ahh.

02:17.887 --> 02:20.655
[Gasps]
My newspaper!

02:20.723 --> 02:23.925
It's been... stolen!

02:26.662 --> 02:29.164
Daffy. Daffy!

02:41.410 --> 02:43.144
What are we doing this for?

02:43.212 --> 02:45.280
- I don't know.
- Let's see.

02:45.348 --> 02:48.283
I came out here to get
my newspaper.

02:48.351 --> 02:50.318
It wasn't there.

02:50.386 --> 02:53.288
And then, I realized...

02:53.356 --> 02:54.623
[Gasps]

02:54.690 --> 02:58.159
Someone stole my newspaper.

03:04.500 --> 03:06.334
What are you so upset about?

03:06.402 --> 03:08.370
I've never even seen you read
the paper.

03:08.437 --> 03:09.704
I don't read it.

03:09.772 --> 03:11.406
I do what normal people do
with it--

03:11.474 --> 03:16.044
day by day, slowly build
a papier-mâché parade float.

03:16.112 --> 03:17.412
What parade are you in?

03:17.480 --> 03:21.683
I'm not in a parade.
I am the parade.

03:21.751 --> 03:25.020
What did
your parents do to you?

03:25.087 --> 03:27.589
Bugsy, old pal,

03:27.657 --> 03:30.292
there's a thief among us.

03:30.359 --> 03:32.727
You just told me to have faith
in our neighbors,

03:32.795 --> 03:36.097
and now, you're insinuating that
one of them stole your paper?

03:36.165 --> 03:38.133
I'm not insinuating anything.

03:38.200 --> 03:41.436
I am simply implying,
in an unscrupulous and cowardly way,

03:41.504 --> 03:43.738
that one of our neighbors
is a thief.

03:43.806 --> 03:45.674
- You're crazy.
- Am I?

03:45.741 --> 03:47.275
- Yes.
- Am I?

03:47.343 --> 03:49.110
- Yes.
- Am I?

03:50.099 --> 03:50.904
Yes.

03:55.633 --> 03:58.535
Daffy, no one stole
your newspaper.

03:58.603 --> 03:59.903
Where are you going?

03:59.971 --> 04:02.406
I'm letting everyone know
what time the dinner party is.

04:02.474 --> 04:04.074
Oh! I'll come with you.

04:04.142 --> 04:07.211
Daffy, you're not going
to accuse the neighbors.

04:07.278 --> 04:10.125
No. I just want
to get some fresh air.

04:14.619 --> 04:15.886
What did you think,

04:15.954 --> 04:18.555
I was going to start
throwing accusations around?

04:18.623 --> 04:22.192
Ha! Silly you.
Give me a little more credit than that.

04:23.461 --> 04:25.896
Oh!
[Giggles] Hello.

04:25.964 --> 04:27.564
Knock off the pleasantries,
grandma.

04:27.632 --> 04:29.333
I know you stole my newspaper.

04:29.401 --> 04:31.301
I'd ask you
to forgive my friend,

04:31.369 --> 04:34.104
but we'll be doing a lot of that
at the dinner party tonight,

04:34.172 --> 04:37.775
which, by the way, is at 8:00.
See you then.

04:39.644 --> 04:41.512
I know you stole my newspaper.

04:41.579 --> 04:43.514
Your suesaper?

04:43.581 --> 04:45.182
My newspaper.

[Chain rattles and door opens]

04:55.326 --> 04:57.594
What do you want, rabbit?

04:57.662 --> 05:00.030
Just wanted to remind you
about tonight's dinner party.

05:00.098 --> 05:02.099
You mean
the "let's all forget about

05:02.167 --> 05:04.768
the horrible things
Daffy Duck has done" party?

05:04.836 --> 05:06.336
Yeah, I'll be there,

05:06.404 --> 05:07.771
unless I get a better offer.

05:07.839 --> 05:10.407
I've got an offer for you.
Give me back my paper.

05:10.475 --> 05:13.677
Yosemite Sam's
a lot of things--

05:13.745 --> 05:17.681
a liar, a cheat,
a false witness, a sore loser,

05:17.749 --> 05:20.050
a bad friend,
a shady businessman,

05:20.118 --> 05:23.320
a blamer, a flim-flammer,
a hornswaggler,

05:23.388 --> 05:25.823
I'm cheap, and I steals things.

05:25.890 --> 05:28.158
But I am no thief.

05:28.226 --> 05:30.694
Now, good day, sirs.

05:32.897 --> 05:34.198
What time's dinner?

05:34.265 --> 05:35.899
8:00 sharp.

05:38.203 --> 05:40.704
Go home.
Fine.

05:42.407 --> 05:45.075
- Now.
- I'm going.

05:51.483 --> 05:52.749
What?

05:52.817 --> 05:55.119
I want to watch you go home.

[Chuckles]

05:56.688 --> 05:59.690
You have
some serious trust issues.

06:01.359 --> 06:03.694
You should get help, man.

[Crow caws]

06:15.473 --> 06:19.109
Oh! Uh, were you about to,
uh, go somewhere?

06:19.177 --> 06:21.145
What?
You mean the broom?

06:21.212 --> 06:23.814
No. I'm cleaning my house.

06:23.882 --> 06:26.183
I drive a minivan.

06:27.385 --> 06:31.488
I'm sneaking around
a witch's house, alone,

06:31.556 --> 06:33.390
looking for a newspaper.

06:33.458 --> 06:35.559
What am I doing?
[Wolf howls]

06:35.627 --> 06:36.760
Take a deep breath.

06:36.828 --> 06:38.996
[Inhales and exhales]

06:39.063 --> 06:43.033
It's just a house--a normal,
everyday witch's house.

06:43.101 --> 06:44.935
There's nothing
to be afraid of.

06:45.003 --> 06:46.403
[Screams]

06:46.471 --> 06:49.840
So I'll see you at 8:00?
I'm making carrot pie.

06:49.908 --> 06:53.076
Pie?
Don't you mean carrot cake?

That duck's apology list is getting long.

07:16.534 --> 07:18.435
[Birds chirping]

07:18.503 --> 07:20.404
So after all that,
I still don't know

07:20.471 --> 07:22.873
which neighbor stole
my newspaper.

07:22.941 --> 07:25.209
Interesting.

07:25.276 --> 07:27.411
I have one question.

07:27.478 --> 07:30.147
[Stammering]
Why don't you just get another paper?

07:30.215 --> 07:32.015
It's the principle.

07:32.083 --> 07:35.352
I hold myself to
an extremely high moral standard.

07:35.420 --> 07:37.821
I treat people and their things
with respect,

07:37.889 --> 07:40.668
and I place the virtue of trust
above all else.

07:42.298 --> 07:44.194
No, you don't.

07:44.262 --> 07:46.730
Well, I expect it from others.

07:46.798 --> 07:48.165
Come on.
You're the only one

07:48.233 --> 07:50.334
who can help me solve
the mystery.

07:50.401 --> 07:54.504
Don't tell Bugs,
but you're my smartest friend.

07:54.572 --> 07:57.741
A mystery, huh?

07:57.809 --> 08:02.446
You know, the key
to a good mystery is the ending.

08:02.513 --> 08:07.784
And 9 out of 10 mystery novels
end the same way.

08:07.852 --> 08:10.187
With a semi-flattering photo
of the author?

08:10.255 --> 08:14.524
They end with all the suspects
gathered under one roof.

08:14.592 --> 08:17.728
What they think is
an innocent dinner party

08:17.795 --> 08:20.697
is, in fact, an elaborate trap.

08:20.765 --> 08:23.734
Wait! We're having a dinner party for
the neighbors tonight.

08:23.801 --> 08:25.535
That's perfect!

08:25.603 --> 08:28.005
Yeah!
At tonight's dinner party,

08:28.072 --> 08:30.340
I can invite everyone
to another dinner party

08:30.408 --> 08:32.476
where I can spring
my elaborate trap!

08:32.543 --> 08:34.311
[Sighs]

08:34.379 --> 08:38.148
Or you could just spring
your elaborate trap

08:38.216 --> 08:41.118
at tonight's dinner party.

08:41.184 --> 08:43.754
Great idea.
I'm glad I thought of it.

08:43.821 --> 08:47.858
Hmm. Maybe I'm
my smartest friend.

a-runnin' ?

? when the ground
starts hummin' ?

about a girl? ?

No!

'cause he's not the best ?

? communicator in the world ?

Don't judge me.

? We'd love to get him
settled down ?

10:00.098 --> 10:02.532
? but he just scratched
through the wall ?

? he got the police chasing
after him ?

I have to make another pie.

10:38.854 --> 10:40.955
You're supposed to be getting
ready for the dinner party.

Oh. I'm ready for
the dinner party, all right.

- What does that mean?
- Nothing.

10:46.962 --> 10:48.229
Did you set the table?

10:48.297 --> 10:51.966
Ohh, I set more than the table.

- What does that mean?
- Nothing.

10:54.036 --> 10:55.236
Did you keep the table simple?

10:55.304 --> 10:56.804
It shouldn't look
too elaborate.

10:56.872 --> 11:01.609
Ohh, the table's not going to
be the thing that's elaborate.

of bringing a gift, either.

to thank everybody for coming

we can all agree
to let bygones be bygones.

that I brought my son.

11:58.901 --> 12:01.936
It's so hard
to get a sitter these days.

12:02.004 --> 12:04.338
Please, let there be other women coming
to this thing.

12:04.406 --> 12:06.741
[Feedback]

12:06.808 --> 12:08.910
[Distorted voice]
Greetings, everybody.

12:08.977 --> 12:12.046
As neighbors, you think
you know each other well.

12:12.114 --> 12:15.883
But what you don't know is that
one of you...

12:15.951 --> 12:17.551
Is a thief!

12:17.619 --> 12:19.387
[Metal rumbling]

12:19.454 --> 12:21.222
[Imitating wind blowing]

12:21.290 --> 12:25.493
Ooh. This is one of those fun
mystery dinner parties.

12:27.229 --> 12:29.397
Let us begin.

12:29.464 --> 12:32.066
Everyone, pick up your plates.

12:32.134 --> 12:33.701
Uh, scary voice?

12:33.769 --> 12:35.202
My son doesn't have a plate.

12:35.270 --> 12:36.671
[Feedback]

12:36.738 --> 12:38.306
Hold on.

12:40.275 --> 12:41.676
Here.

12:41.743 --> 12:42.977
Thank you.

12:43.045 --> 12:44.745
Where's the bathroom?

12:44.813 --> 12:47.315
Just hold it.

12:47.382 --> 12:49.150
[Distorted voice]
Now,

12:49.217 --> 12:52.219
under your plates,
you'll find a number.

12:53.889 --> 12:55.890
Ain't no numbers
on these things.

12:55.958 --> 12:57.291
What?

13:10.305 --> 13:14.575
Now, one of you has a plate
with the number 5 on it.

13:14.643 --> 13:17.111
Who has the number 5?

13:17.980 --> 13:20.014
- I do.
- So do I.

13:20.082 --> 13:21.749
How'd that happen?

13:25.487 --> 13:27.021
There. Now you have a 3.

13:27.089 --> 13:28.255
I have a 3.

13:28.323 --> 13:30.391
[Groans]

13:33.962 --> 13:35.629
[Laughs]

13:35.697 --> 13:37.598
What a fun party.

13:37.666 --> 13:39.800
Everyone getting along?

13:39.868 --> 13:42.069
[Laughs] Oh, yes!

13:42.137 --> 13:45.606
The voice is having us do
lots of things.

13:45.674 --> 13:47.875
That's nice.

13:47.943 --> 13:50.444
I, uh, think I smell
burning carrots.

13:50.512 --> 13:52.246
Oh! My pie!

13:52.314 --> 13:53.914
Quick,
what number do you have again?

13:53.982 --> 13:56.183
[Stammers] 5.

13:56.251 --> 13:57.985
Ok. You two switch plates.

13:59.855 --> 14:01.889
Now, what number do you have?

14:01.957 --> 14:04.325
- 5.
- [Gasps]

14:06.028 --> 14:08.629
Open your eyes, grandma.
It's clearly a 3.

14:08.697 --> 14:10.831
You're a 3.
I'm a 3.

14:10.899 --> 14:12.099
Why are you 3?

14:12.167 --> 14:13.934
I have no idea.

14:14.002 --> 14:15.436
Do you want me to be a 3?

14:15.504 --> 14:17.171
Yes. Thank you.

14:17.239 --> 14:19.807
Finally,
someone is cooperating.

14:19.875 --> 14:23.277
[Inhales and exhales]

14:23.345 --> 14:27.948
Now, who has the number 3?

14:30.485 --> 14:32.720
[Gasps]
I'm hungry.

14:32.788 --> 14:35.489
Can we eat first,
and then play the game?

14:35.557 --> 14:38.359
It's not a game,
it's a trap--

14:38.427 --> 14:40.661
an elaborate trap designed to
extract a confession

14:40.729 --> 14:42.063
from one of you dirty thieves!

14:42.130 --> 14:45.399
And then, we'll have
an apology party, all right,

14:45.467 --> 14:47.935
but the apologies are going
to be to me.

14:48.003 --> 14:50.805
Now, one of you stole
my newspaper. Confess!

14:50.872 --> 14:53.174
[All gasp]
Really?

14:53.241 --> 14:54.809
You're really going there?

14:54.876 --> 14:56.377
Yeah. I'm going there.

14:56.445 --> 14:58.112
Where is he going?

14:58.180 --> 15:00.147
Because if you go there,

15:00.215 --> 15:01.816
I will go there.

15:01.883 --> 15:05.152
And you do not want to be there
when I get there.

15:05.220 --> 15:06.854
Because when I get there,

15:06.922 --> 15:08.422
I will be so there

15:08.490 --> 15:11.725
that you will wish
you had stayed right here.

15:11.793 --> 15:14.095
Me? What about you?

15:14.162 --> 15:16.163
You don't care about
your neighbors.

15:16.231 --> 15:18.666
You're just scared one of them
is going to sue you.

15:19.668 --> 15:21.268
[Chuckles]
You're crazy.

15:21.336 --> 15:22.803
I'm crazy?

15:22.871 --> 15:25.106
You're the one
who made carrot pie.

15:25.173 --> 15:26.974
I mean, carrot pie?

15:27.042 --> 15:28.375
Ever heard of carrot cake?

15:28.443 --> 15:31.612
That's an actual dessert
made with carrots.

15:31.680 --> 15:35.116
And do you make it? No!
You make carrot pie--

15:35.183 --> 15:37.518
a thing no one eats!

15:44.893 --> 15:47.828
Mmm. Mmm!

15:47.896 --> 15:49.363
Mmm.

15:49.431 --> 15:52.366
Mm! Mmm.

15:52.434 --> 15:54.568
[Grunting and chewing]

15:56.538 --> 15:59.039
This party blows.
I'm going home.

15:59.107 --> 16:02.143
Well, I'm not going anywhere
until I get an apology

16:02.210 --> 16:04.245
for everything
this fool has gone.

16:04.312 --> 16:07.214
I mean, turning a bunch of rats loose
on Columbus day.

16:07.282 --> 16:08.549
Who does that?

16:08.617 --> 16:12.219
The same jackanapes who durn near burn
my house down.

16:12.287 --> 16:13.587
And by the way,

16:13.655 --> 16:14.989
you don't go accusing
your neighbors

16:15.056 --> 16:17.558
of stealing something
without any evidence,

16:17.626 --> 16:20.161
especially something as dumb
as a newspaper.

16:20.228 --> 16:22.663
I mean, come on.
Read the Internet.

16:22.731 --> 16:25.766
For the last time,
I don't read it!

16:25.834 --> 16:28.469
Hasn't anyone seen
my parade float?

16:28.537 --> 16:31.438
You heard the witch--
uh, I mean, lady.

16:31.506 --> 16:33.674
You owes us all an apology.

16:33.742 --> 16:36.877
Well?
Say you're sorry.

16:36.945 --> 16:38.112
Uhh...

16:38.180 --> 16:41.315
You can't say it, can you?

16:41.383 --> 16:43.050
I can say it.

16:43.118 --> 16:45.319
Uh...[Mutters]

16:45.387 --> 16:46.587
Then say it.

16:46.655 --> 16:49.256
I'm solly.

16:49.324 --> 16:51.358
Did you just say you're solly?

16:51.426 --> 16:53.194
I'm soggy.

16:53.261 --> 16:54.595
You're soggy?

16:54.663 --> 16:56.964
I'm sarming.

16:58.133 --> 17:00.701
You're the worst neighbor
I ever met.

17:00.769 --> 17:03.137
And I should know.
Before I met you,

17:03.205 --> 17:05.406
I was the worst neighbor
I ever met.

17:05.473 --> 17:07.241
Ehh.
It's still a close call.

17:07.309 --> 17:10.010
You're the biggest monster
in this neighborhood.

17:10.078 --> 17:13.247
That's saying a lot.
He's an actual monster.

17:13.315 --> 17:14.415
The stunts you have pulled
in this neighborhood--

17:14.482 --> 17:15.915
Ooh! Consarned you!

17:15.983 --> 17:17.751
Goldarned ruined...
Too many to even count!

17:17.819 --> 17:18.886
This here neighborhood!

17:18.954 --> 17:20.454
I don't know
who you think you are!

17:20.521 --> 17:21.821
- Let me tell you something--
- What is wrong with you?

17:21.890 --> 17:23.223
[Whistles]

17:23.290 --> 17:25.559
I have something to say.

17:27.061 --> 17:28.529
I like him.

17:29.531 --> 17:31.865
My life is so boring,

17:31.933 --> 17:35.469
but tonight was the most fun
I've had in years,

17:35.537 --> 17:38.072
and it's all thanks to him.

17:38.139 --> 17:40.307
Ohh, well, you've got to admit,

17:40.375 --> 17:44.011
our street got a lot more interesting
when he moved in.

17:44.079 --> 17:46.180
Huh. That is true.

17:46.248 --> 17:49.350
It was certainly the most memorable
Columbus day I ever had.

17:49.417 --> 17:50.784
I've been meaning to ask you.

17:50.852 --> 17:54.788
Did the rats symbolize the colonization
of the new world

17:54.856 --> 17:56.991
by comparing the arrival
of the Europeans

17:57.058 --> 17:59.893
to an infestation of vermin?

17:59.961 --> 18:01.629
I didn't follow any of that.

18:01.696 --> 18:03.564
[Laughs]

18:03.632 --> 18:05.633
What? I'm serious.

18:05.700 --> 18:08.035
I didn't understand
anything you just said.

18:08.103 --> 18:10.237
[Laughter]

18:13.108 --> 18:14.775
So let me get this straight--

18:14.843 --> 18:16.710
no one wants to sue me?

18:16.778 --> 18:19.213
Sue you? Come on, now.

18:19.281 --> 18:21.048
Have a little faith
in your neighbors.

18:21.116 --> 18:23.651
That's what I said!

18:23.718 --> 18:26.787
- [Groans]
- Are we ever going to eat?

18:26.855 --> 18:28.322
Why not?

18:30.558 --> 18:32.760
I have something
I'd like to say.

18:38.600 --> 18:41.101
Which one of you stole
my newspaper?

18:44.406 --> 18:46.140
I'll drink to that.

18:46.207 --> 18:47.741
[Laughter]

18:47.809 --> 18:49.910
[Indistinct talking
and laughter]

19:03.191 --> 19:04.992
Beep beep!

19:18.807 --> 19:20.674

20:29.778 --> 20:31.412
[Rapid buzzing]

20:47.595 --> 20:49.329
[Explosion]

20:57.038 --> 20:58.872
Beep beep!

21:00.542 --> 21:02.309
[Crashes]

21:05.146 --> 21:06.181
No newspaper, huh?

21:06.448 --> 21:07.881
Just the mail.

21:07.949 --> 21:10.384
Bill. Junk mail.
Weird charity.

21:10.452 --> 21:13.587
[Laughs]
How many renewal notices

21:13.655 --> 21:16.323
is that stupid newspaper
going to send me?

21:21.629 --> 21:23.363
[Gasps]

21:23.431 --> 21:26.733
No one stole my newspaper!

21:26.801 --> 21:29.705
I forgot to renew
my subscription.

21:33.842 --> 21:37.110
Ironic.
Done in by his own creation.
