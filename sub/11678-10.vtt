no job history.

- You're stuck in whatever city

- Where am I?

comes your way.

- Should we shoot them?

on you to the F.B.I.--

- Family too--
- Hey, is that your mom again?

- if you're desperate.
- Someone needs
your help, Michael.

00:36.404 --> 00:38.672
Bottom line:
Until you figure out
who burned you,

the right dress.

Are they real?
Well, they look real.

A fake identity is known in

You need a pro.

Yes. What can I do for you?
Uh, I lost my passport

I heard, uh, I could
get some new ones here.

All you gotta do is
report 'em stolen. They'll
send you replacements.

01:53.481 --> 01:55.983
Right. But the thing is...

01:56.049 --> 02:00.087
I'm going on a trip soon,
and I heard you could
do it here more quickly...

02:00.154 --> 02:02.256
and more quietly.

02:03.391 --> 02:05.693
That might be possible--
for a fee.

Then Doug turned on him, and
I wasn't gonna let that happen.

the right decision.
He took him.

But technically,
we're still married,

One of the things you learn

I'd be at this one?
- Istanbul wasn't that long ago.

38:14.726 --> 38:17.329
You like rooftops over windows,

38:17.396 --> 38:21.199
you like angles with the target
on your right-hand side,
'cause you're left-handed.

38:21.266 --> 38:23.835
That's right.
I knew I liked you.

38:25.270 --> 38:27.305
Put it on.

38:27.373 --> 38:29.808
[ Scoffs ]
Michael,

38:29.875 --> 38:32.711
is this what
you really want, huh?

38:32.778 --> 38:35.246
Helping out civilians
with their little problems,

38:35.313 --> 38:37.082
trying to get
your government job back?

38:37.148 --> 38:38.650
It's pathetic.

38:38.717 --> 38:41.353
You're better than that.
[ Clicks ]

38:42.821 --> 38:45.256
Let's go.
We have a big day ahead of us.

38:45.323 --> 38:48.660
I gotta turn you in. There'll
be questions. It'll be past
lunch before we're done.

38:48.727 --> 38:50.829
[ Chuckles ]
Turn me in?

38:50.896 --> 38:53.264
A lot of secrets,
a lot of enemies.

38:53.331 --> 38:54.900
Think it'd be
a short stay, don't you?

38:54.966 --> 38:58.336
Now, don't you think we could
come to some arrangement?

38:59.905 --> 39:02.841
I don't think so.
Now be honest with me.

39:03.909 --> 39:05.944
If circumstances
were different,

39:09.515 --> 39:11.517
do you think
that we could--

39:16.121 --> 39:18.424
Not in this lifetime.

39:18.490 --> 39:20.025
Perhaps the next one.

39:23.829 --> 39:26.364

[ People Screaming ]

39:39.578 --> 39:42.548
Indictments
came down yesterday.
That was quick.

39:42.614 --> 39:45.150
They found the leak
in the U.S. Attorney's office,

39:45.216 --> 39:47.118
and Evelyn-- wow.

39:47.185 --> 39:49.320
They're gonna be
workin' up her file for years.

39:49.387 --> 39:52.323
She was a very,
very bad girl.

39:52.390 --> 39:54.793
I managed to keep you
out of it so far.

39:54.860 --> 39:57.496
It's gonna take some work.
I appreciate that, Lucy.

39:57.563 --> 39:59.431
Don't say I never did
anything for you.

39:59.498 --> 40:00.666
I never would.

40:03.435 --> 40:06.137
Did she say anything before--

40:08.273 --> 40:12.678
She wished that things
had turned out differently.

40:14.379 --> 40:16.081
Tell me about
Doug and Jasper.

40:16.147 --> 40:20.318
On their way to a new life
in an undisclosed location.

40:20.385 --> 40:22.353
He's gonna have to
come back for trial.

40:22.420 --> 40:25.423
[ Sighs ]
Wanted you to have that.

40:29.761 --> 40:32.030
And I have another
present for you.

40:32.097 --> 40:33.899
It's your new identity.

40:35.901 --> 40:39.571
It should get you to D.C.
or wherever.
[ Sighs ]

40:39.638 --> 40:41.339
Thank you, Lucy.

40:41.406 --> 40:43.041
It's the least I could do.

40:43.108 --> 40:45.343
What about your car?
Whatever it costs,
I want to reimburse you.

40:45.410 --> 40:47.145
Don't worry about it.

40:47.212 --> 40:49.748
I'm not gonna be in Miami
that much longer.

40:49.815 --> 40:52.651
- I'll see you again?
- Maybe.

41:01.226 --> 41:03.128
Lucy.
Sam.

41:06.164 --> 41:08.066
So, is that
your new I.D.?

41:08.133 --> 41:10.435
Yep.

41:10.502 --> 41:13.004
I could get into
the White House pressroom
with these documents.

41:14.305 --> 41:16.441
I don't think
you're gonna need it.
Why is that?

41:16.508 --> 41:18.510
Just got a call
from a buddy,

41:18.577 --> 41:22.180
one of the guys I asked
to keep an eye out on this
burn notice business.

41:22.247 --> 41:25.517
You might want to rethink
your trip to D.C.
Why? What'd he say?

41:25.584 --> 41:28.319
The guy who burned you,

41:28.386 --> 41:32.524
turns out you don't need to
go up there to see him,
'cause,

41:32.591 --> 41:34.560
well, he's coming
down here to see you.

41:35.561 --> 41:37.629
See me?

41:37.696 --> 41:40.331
What does that mean?
I don't know.

41:40.398 --> 41:42.500
Just a heads-up.

41:45.003 --> 41:46.938
Well,

41:47.005 --> 41:50.676
looks like I'm gonna have to
get the Charger fixed after all.
Yeah.
