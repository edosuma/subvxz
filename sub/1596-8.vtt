- I'M RAISING FIVE KIDS,
AND I DIDN'T MISS LAST WEEK.

00:11.011 --> 00:12.471
WHAT'S YOUR EXCUSE?

00:12.471 --> 00:13.806
SHUT THE FUCK UP!

00:13.806 --> 00:15.391
I NEED YOU
TO GET A WILL NOTARIZED.

00:15.391 --> 00:17.227
- WILL?
- AUNT GINGER'S.

00:17.227 --> 00:18.477
- A WILL'S NO GOOD
WITHOUT A DEATH CERTIFICATE.

00:18.477 --> 00:20.063
- YEAH, WE'RE GONNA NEED
A BODY TOO.

00:20.063 --> 00:21.939
- A REAL LIVE BODY?
- NOT LIVE.

00:21.939 --> 00:23.315
- I'M HERE TO FILE A WILL,
PLEASE.

00:23.315 --> 00:25.317
- GINGER GALLAGHER.
SECOND ONE TODAY.

00:25.317 --> 00:26.861
SUPERSEDES YOURS.

00:26.861 --> 00:29.321
- WHO THE HELL FILED IT?
COUSIN PATRICK.

00:29.321 --> 00:31.323
both: ARE YOU OUT
OF YOUR FUCKING MIND?

00:31.323 --> 00:33.617
- KEV IS JUST GONNA LIE DOWN
WITH YOU FOR PROCREATION.

00:33.617 --> 00:35.161
- OKAY, LET'S GET THIS GOING.

00:35.161 --> 00:37.371
- [laughs]
- SHH, KNOCK IT OFF, MAMA.

00:37.371 --> 00:39.165
- HOW MANY MORE TIMES
ARE WE GONNA HAVE TO DO THIS?

00:39.165 --> 00:40.583
- UNTIL WE COMPLETE
THE MISSION.

00:40.583 --> 00:42.085
- YOU GUYS LOOK LIKE
YOU COULD USE SOME HELP.

00:42.085 --> 00:43.169
- YOU CAN GO HOME.

00:43.169 --> 00:44.795
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
HAVE HER STICK AROUND.

00:44.795 --> 00:46.338
I GOT TO HIT THE ALIBI
IN TEN MINUTES ANYWAY.

00:46.338 --> 00:48.007
- I'M GOOD TO STAY.
- PLEASE JUST GO HOME

00:48.007 --> 00:49.800
TO YOUR OWN
FUCKING HOUSE FOR ONCE.

00:49.800 --> 00:51.927
- YOU MIND IF I MAKE
ONE OF THESE OUT TO CASH?

00:51.927 --> 00:53.679
NOTHING BIG,
JUST SOME WALKING AROUND MONEY.

00:53.679 --> 00:55.681
- JOINT BANK ACCOUNT
IS FOR IMMIGRATION ONLY.

00:55.681 --> 00:58.101
- HAVE A HEART.
I'M TAPPED.

00:58.101 --> 01:00.478
- MOM.
- OH!

01:00.478 --> 01:02.230
- WHERE IS HE, MY BABY?

01:02.230 --> 01:04.899
- HE'S WHERE
HE BELONGS FOR NOW,

01:04.899 --> 01:07.234
AND YOU'RE BACK
WHERE YOU BELONG.

01:07.234 --> 01:10.571
- NOW, IF I ALLOW YOU
TO RETAIN YOUR PARENTAL RIGHTS,

01:10.571 --> 01:13.199
WOULD YOU CONSENT TO
YOUR DAUGHTER BECOMING GUARDIAN?

01:13.199 --> 01:14.700
- WORKS FOR ME.

01:14.700 --> 01:17.286
- WOULD YOU AGREE TO BE
THE GUARDIAN OF THESE CHILDREN?

01:17.286 --> 01:19.538
- YES, I DO.

IN HONOR OF AUNT GINGER.

02:40.744 --> 02:43.247
"G.G." AS I CALLED HER.

02:43.247 --> 02:44.957
YOU NOW, WHEN THE GUY
AT THE FUNERAL PLACE

02:44.957 --> 02:46.250
HANDED ME HER ASHES,
I THOUGHT,

02:46.250 --> 02:47.918
WHAT THE HELL
DO I DO WITH THESE?

02:47.918 --> 02:50.671
PUT 'EM IN A VASE
ON MY MANTLE?

02:50.671 --> 02:52.506
OR SCATTER THEM
AT THE PARK OR THE LAKE?

02:52.506 --> 02:55.175
THEN I THOUGHT, NO,

02:55.175 --> 02:57.970
I KNOW WHERE
SHE WAS HAPPIEST.

02:57.970 --> 03:01.224
ON THIS CORNER,
HER CORNER,

03:01.224 --> 03:03.517
WHERE SHE TURNED TRICKS
IN HER 20s AND 30s.

03:03.517 --> 03:05.019
- AND 60s!

03:05.019 --> 03:08.439
- SHE DID MAGIC TRICKS?
- NO, NO, NO, SON.

03:08.439 --> 03:11.066
"TURNING TRICKS" IS
A EUPHEMISM FOR PROSTITUTION.

03:11.066 --> 03:13.736
IN HER DAY, YOUR GREAT AUNT WAS
A LEGENDARY POLE SMOKER.

03:13.736 --> 03:16.864
COULD UNLOCK HER JAW
LIKE A BURMESE PYTHON.

03:16.864 --> 03:18.782
- WE ARE AT HER FUNERAL.

03:18.782 --> 03:20.242
- YOU KNOW,
SOME THINK GALLAGHERS

03:20.242 --> 03:22.119
DON'T HAVE A WORK ETHIC,

03:22.119 --> 03:25.581
BUT GINGER WORKED THIS CORNER
RAIN, SLEET, SNOW,

03:25.581 --> 03:27.374
HER OLD KNEES HITTING
THAT HARD PAVEMENT

03:27.374 --> 03:29.252
AGAIN AND AGAIN.

03:29.252 --> 03:33.255
BERTIE GIDDELMAN IS THE ONLY ONE
THAT'S OUTLASTED HER.

03:33.255 --> 03:36.258
- LOOK, YOU ALL KNEW GINGER,
SO I AIN'T GONNA SUGARCOAT IT.

03:36.258 --> 03:38.303
SHE WAS A MEAN OLD BITCH.

03:38.303 --> 03:41.930
BUT EVEN A MEAN OLD BITCH
DESERVES A SEND OFF.

03:41.930 --> 03:43.433
- HERE, HERE.

03:43.433 --> 03:44.808
- SO THIS IS US, GINGER,

03:44.808 --> 03:50.440
SENDING YOU OFF,
RIGHT WHERE YOU BELONG.

03:52.399 --> 03:53.734
- IT'S TOUCHING.

03:53.734 --> 03:55.569
- I'M TEARING UP.

03:55.569 --> 03:57.322
- OKAY, KIDS, LET'S GO.

03:57.322 --> 03:59.156
- PATRICK.

03:59.156 --> 04:01.325
SO GINGER HAD A WILL
THAT WE DIDN'T KNOW ABOUT,

04:01.325 --> 04:03.827
AND YOU JUST HAD IT SITTING
IN A DRAWER?

04:03.827 --> 04:05.455
- YEP.

04:05.455 --> 04:07.415
- AND EVEN THOUGH
SHE HATED YOUR GUTS,

04:07.415 --> 04:08.415
SHE LEFT OUR HOUSE TO YOU?

04:08.415 --> 04:10.209
- IT WAS NEVER YOUR HOUSE.

04:10.209 --> 04:11.877
- IT'S WEIRD, YOU KNOW,

04:11.877 --> 04:13.629
HOW SHE SIGNED THE WILL
ONLY A YEAR AGO,

04:13.629 --> 04:15.130
YOU KNOW, HER BEING
AN INVALID AND ALL.

04:15.130 --> 04:16.882
- SIGNED AND NOTARIZED.

04:16.882 --> 04:18.591
- I DON'T REMEMBER YOU
COMING BY WITH A LAWYER.

04:18.591 --> 04:20.010
- I GOTTA GET BACK
TO MY FAMILY.

04:20.010 --> 04:21.678
- SIX KIDS
WITH NOWHERE ELSE TO GO.

04:21.678 --> 04:23.473
- WHY DON'T
WE TALK ABOUT THIS

04:23.473 --> 04:25.391
WHEN THE STING OF LOSING GINGER
HAS WORN OFF, HMM?

04:25.391 --> 04:27.559
TOMORROW, MAYBE?

04:33.816 --> 04:37.986
- YOU WANT TO TELL THEM
OR SHOULD I?

04:37.986 --> 04:42.199
- V, YOUR MOM'S HERE.

04:42.199 --> 04:43.867
OOH.
YOU LOOK REALLY NICE, CAROL.

04:43.867 --> 04:45.786
- THANK YOU, HONEY.
- YOU DO LOOK NICE.

04:45.786 --> 04:48.539
WHERE'D YOU GET THAT DRESS?
- MADISON'S.

04:48.539 --> 04:50.375
- AND THOSE SHOES.

04:50.375 --> 04:51.375
YOU DOING SOMETHING
AT CHURCH LATER?

04:51.375 --> 04:53.669
- I'M OVULATING AGAIN.

04:53.669 --> 04:55.546
- OVULATING?

04:55.546 --> 04:57.507
NO, IT'S NOT UNTIL NEXT WEEK.
I GOT THE CALENDAR.

04:57.507 --> 04:59.007
- HIGH BODY TEMPERATURE,
SORE BREASTS,

04:59.007 --> 05:00.467
INCREASED CERVICAL MUCUS.

05:00.467 --> 05:01.927
- WE BELIEVE YOU, MAMA.

05:01.927 --> 05:03.345
- WELL, IF YOU ALL WANT
TO TRY AGAIN,

05:03.345 --> 05:06.640
WE HAVE A FOUR-DAY WINDOW.

05:06.640 --> 05:09.143
- GUESS NO NEED TO WASTE
AN OPPORTUNITY, RIGHT, BABY?

05:09.143 --> 05:11.479
- WHAT, YOU WANNA DO THIS
RIGHT NOW?

05:11.479 --> 05:12.354
LIKE, RIGHT NOW?

05:12.354 --> 05:13.939
- WELL, I CAN COME BACK.

05:13.939 --> 05:15.983
- NO, NO NEED.

05:15.983 --> 05:17.776
I'M LIKE A STUD BULL.

05:17.776 --> 05:19.945
YOU OPEN THE BARN DOOR,
SLAP ME ON THE ASS.

05:19.945 --> 05:22.322
YOU KNOW, I MEAN, WHEN I SAY,
"OPEN THE BARN DOOR,"

05:22.322 --> 05:25.325
I DON'T MEAN YOUR, UM--

05:25.325 --> 05:27.202
UH, DO YOU GUYS
WANT A DRINK?

05:27.202 --> 05:29.414
- I'LL GET THREE GLASSES.

05:32.207 --> 05:33.584
- ARE YOU SURE YOU JUST WANT
TO JUMP INTO THIS?

05:33.584 --> 05:35.127
YOU DON'T WANT A MINUTE
TO THINK?

05:35.127 --> 05:36.920
- WAITING ISN'T GONNA
MAKE IT EASIER.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.505
- ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA
BLOCK EVERYTHING OUT,

05:38.505 --> 05:40.424
AND I'M JUST GONNA PICTURE
YOUR BEAUTIFUL FACE.

05:40.424 --> 05:43.969
- I PICTURE DENZEL WASHINGTON.
- OH, FOR REAL?

05:43.969 --> 05:47.389
- WHEN I OPEN MY EYES A LITTLE
AND I SEE IT'S A WHITE GUY,

05:47.389 --> 05:49.850
EH, THEN I GO
WITH JOHNNY DEPP.

05:49.850 --> 05:51.226
- OH?

05:51.226 --> 05:53.520
- YOU APPRECIATE THE IRONY,
RIGHT?

05:53.520 --> 05:56.440
SENSELESS ARGUMENTS ABOUT
WHO GETS WHAT BEDROOM,

05:56.440 --> 05:58.734
REFUSING TO ALLOW ME TO STAY.

05:58.734 --> 06:02.362
NOW, NOBODY GETS TO STAY.
- WHY IS FRANK HERE AGAIN?

06:02.362 --> 06:03.906
- THERE'S A SMALL CHANCE
HE'LL BE ABLE TO HELP

06:03.906 --> 06:06.492
SINCE HE'S KNOWN PATRICK
LONGER THAN ANY OF US.

06:06.492 --> 06:08.076
- PATRICK WANTS
TO STEAL OUR HOUSE?

06:08.076 --> 06:09.537
- HE'S A CONTRACTOR.
HE'S GONNA FLIP IT.

06:09.537 --> 06:10.579
SLAP A COAT OF PAINT ON IT,

06:10.579 --> 06:12.956
CALL IT
"A COZY, AUTHENTIC PRE-WAR,"

06:12.956 --> 06:14.041
AND OFFLOAD IT TO YUPPIES.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.793
- NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

06:15.793 --> 06:17.544
SO LET'S GO OVER OUR OPTIONS.
- I'LL WRITE THEM DOWN.

06:17.544 --> 06:19.546
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK, WE KNOW
THE WILL IS BULLSHIT.

06:19.546 --> 06:21.256
IT WAS SIGNED A YEAR AGO,

06:21.256 --> 06:23.217
AND GINGER'S
BEEN DEAD FOR WHAT, 10?

06:23.217 --> 06:24.760
- MORE LIKE 15.

06:24.760 --> 06:27.596
- OPTION ONE:
PROVE WILL IS A FORGERY.

06:27.596 --> 06:29.848
- WE CAN'T CALL THE COPS
BECAUSE WE FAKED GINGER'S DEATH

06:29.848 --> 06:31.809
AND FORGED A WILL OF OUR OWN.

06:31.809 --> 06:34.394
- PLUS FRANK'S BEEN CASHING
GINGER'S SOCIAL SECURITY CHECKS.

06:34.394 --> 06:37.022
- OH, LIKE YOU DIDN'T SHARE
IN THAT BOUNTY?

06:37.022 --> 06:38.732
- WHAT WE COULD DO,
WE COULD ARGUE

06:38.732 --> 06:41.569
THAT GINGER WASN'T OF
SOUND MIND WHEN SHE SIGNED IT.

06:41.569 --> 06:43.612
I MEAN, SHE WAS
NEVER OF SOUND MIND ANYWAY.

06:43.612 --> 06:47.492
- OPTION TWO:
SAY GINGER WAS CRAZY.

06:47.492 --> 06:49.493
- OR CONVINCE PATRICK
TO BACK OFF SOMEHOW.

06:49.493 --> 06:50.702
- YEAH, THAT'S THREE.

06:50.702 --> 06:52.120
- GOOD LUCK WITH THAT!

06:52.120 --> 06:53.580
HIS NICKNAME
USED TO BE PIT BULL.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.499
IT WAS PARTLY AN ODOR THING,

06:55.499 --> 06:57.709
BUT ALSO BECAUSE ONCE HE GETS
AHOLD OF YOU, HE DOESN'T LET GO.

06:57.709 --> 06:59.294
YOU GOTTA KILL HIM FIRST.

06:59.294 --> 07:01.631
- OPTION FOUR: KILL PATRICK.

07:01.631 --> 07:03.048
- IT'S TIME TO FACE REALITY.

07:03.048 --> 07:05.217
PATRICK OUT-GALLAGHERED US,

07:05.217 --> 07:07.928
AND THERE'S NO POINT
IN FIGHTING IT.

07:07.928 --> 07:09.763
- EASY FOR YOU TO SAY,
YOU'RE AT SHEILA'S.

07:09.763 --> 07:11.390
- SO BEFORE YOU'RE OUT
ON THE STREETS

07:11.390 --> 07:14.852
LIKE SO MANY SOMALIAN REFUGEES,
ASK YOURSELVES,

07:14.852 --> 07:17.855
"IF PATRICK
IS TAKING THE HOUSE,

07:17.855 --> 07:21.108
WHAT ARE WE TAKING?"

07:21.108 --> 07:22.693
COPPER PIPES.

07:22.693 --> 07:24.653
- YOU'RE NOT TAKING THE PIPES,
FRANK.

07:24.653 --> 07:27.532
YOU REALLY THINK THERE'S
A WAY TO CHALLENGE THE WILL?

07:27.532 --> 07:29.616
- WHY NOT? YOU KNOW,
IF I CAN BONE UP ON PROBATE LAW.

07:29.616 --> 07:33.120
- ALL IN FAVOR.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.204
UNANIMOUS.

07:34.204 --> 07:35.581
- WELL, LIKE HELL IT IS.

07:35.581 --> 07:36.623
- LIP WILL HANDLE THE WILL.

07:36.623 --> 07:38.333
THE REST OF YOU,

07:38.333 --> 07:39.585
GET READY FOR THE FIRST DAY
OF SCHOOL TOMORROW.

07:39.585 --> 07:40.836
DEBBIE AND CARL,
PICK OUT SOMETHING TO WEAR

07:40.836 --> 07:42.505
THAT DOESN'T HAVE HOLES.

07:42.505 --> 07:43.631
- WOULDN'T IT JUST BE EASIER
TO KILL HIM?

07:43.631 --> 07:44.590
- CLOTHES, NOW.

07:44.590 --> 07:46.508
WE BETTER WORK FAST.

07:46.508 --> 07:48.760
WINTER'S COMING, AND IT'LL
BE COLD SLEEPING IN THE PARK.

07:48.760 --> 07:51.556
- THIS IS WHY DEMOCRACY
DOES NOT WORK.

07:54.683 --> 07:57.561
- TIME TO GET OUT
THE "HELP WANTED" ADS.

07:57.561 --> 07:59.855
- HOW YOU HOLDING UP?
- YOU KNOW WHAT I WANT?

07:59.855 --> 08:03.693
NOT TO WIN THE LOTTERY OR
GO ON VACATION TO THE CARIBBEAN.

08:03.693 --> 08:05.695
I WANT NORMAL PEOPLE PROBLEMS.

08:05.695 --> 08:07.613
LIKE,
AM I GETTING ENOUGH FIBER?

08:07.613 --> 08:10.073
WHY DID MY FRIEND
SAY THAT INSENSITIVE THING

08:10.073 --> 08:11.825
ABOUT MY WEIGHT?

08:11.825 --> 08:14.828
- WELL, IT'LL WORK OUT,
IT ALWAYS DOES.

08:14.828 --> 08:17.707
- YOU REALIZE ONLY RICH PEOPLE
SAY SHIT LIKE THAT.

08:19.667 --> 08:20.918
- WHAT'S THAT
SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

08:20.918 --> 08:22.712
- THAT WE HAVE NO BACKUP PLAN.

08:22.712 --> 08:23.879
THERE'S NO RUNNING
TO MOM AND DAD.

08:23.879 --> 08:25.505
- AND THAT'S WHAT I DO?

08:25.505 --> 08:27.674
- I'M SAYING NEITHER ONE OF US
HAS A JOB.

08:27.674 --> 08:29.176
ONE WEEK WITH ME
AS THEIR GUARDIAN, ONE,

08:29.176 --> 08:31.386
THEY'RE ABOUT TO BE HOMELESS.

08:31.386 --> 08:32.763
- THEN WE'LL GET JOBS.

08:32.763 --> 08:35.640
I MEAN, THE GALLAGHERS
ARE SURVIVORS, RIGHT?

08:35.640 --> 08:37.602
WE CAN DO THIS.

08:37.602 --> 08:39.269
- WE?

08:39.269 --> 08:42.063
- YOU, ME, WE.

08:45.693 --> 08:47.986
- SINCE WHEN
ARE YOU A LAWYER?

08:47.986 --> 08:49.529
- SINCE NEVER,

08:49.529 --> 08:51.198
WHICH IS WHY I HAVE TO READ UP
ON THIS SHIT.

08:51.198 --> 08:55.578

13:24.179 --> 13:27.015
NO.
NO, NO, NO, DON'T SAY THAT.

13:27.015 --> 13:29.851
- FRANK, I'M JUST ASKING YOU
TO GO HOME TO YOUR FAMILY.

13:29.851 --> 13:33.730
- MY FAMILY THREW ME OUT WITH
NO REGARD FOR MY WELL-BEING.

13:33.730 --> 13:34.981
DO YOU WANT ME HOMELESS?

13:34.981 --> 13:37.317

MY LIFE TOGETHER.

13:47.410 --> 13:49.120
I'M GOING TO A.A.

13:49.120 --> 13:50.872

A JUDGE ORDERED YOU TO GO.

13:50.872 --> 13:52.040
- SHEILA.

13:52.040 --> 13:54.877
- FRANK, YOU'RE A GOOD MAN,

13:54.877 --> 13:58.713
BUT YOU'VE GOT TO FIND
ANOTHER PLACE TO STAY.

14:03.885 --> 14:06.263
- JESUS, CARL,
THERE'S ENOUGH TO GO AROUND.

14:06.263 --> 14:07.681
WOULD YOU GRAB THE PAPER BAGS?

14:07.681 --> 14:10.600
- IF WE HAVE TO MOVE,
WHERE DO WE GO?

14:10.600 --> 14:11.893
- WE'RE NOT MOVING.

14:11.893 --> 14:13.061
HOW'S IT GOING
WITH GINGER'S WILL?

14:14.312 --> 14:15.855
- V, THANKS FOR
TAKING LIAM TODAY.

AND WHEN HE'S CRANKY AND SMELLY,
I GET TO BRING HIM BACK.

LIAM TOMORROW TOO?

14:59.983 --> 15:01.944

SO IS LIP GETTING SERIOUS
ABOUT MANDY SKANKOVICH?

15:08.993 --> 15:11.036
- NICE.

15:11.036 --> 15:12.746
- OH, SHIT, MANDY, I'M SORRY.

15:12.746 --> 15:16.916
YOU KNOW I WOULD HAVE NEVER
SAID THAT TO YOUR FACE.

15:16.916 --> 15:19.128
SHOULD I APOLOGIZE OR LEAVE?

15:19.128 --> 15:21.463
I'M GONNA LEAVE.

15:21.463 --> 15:25.717
- YOU AND I BOTH KNOW YOU'RE NOT
LEGALLY ENTITLED TO SHIT.

15:25.717 --> 15:27.052
- PATRICK?

15:27.052 --> 15:28.762

DESMOND AND WARREN.

15:28.762 --> 15:30.263
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

15:30.263 --> 15:31.890
- OH, JUST A QUICK WALKTHROUGH
TO ASSESS REPAIRS,

15:31.890 --> 15:33.141
SHOULDN'T TAKE TOO LONG.

15:33.141 --> 15:34.893
- IT'D BE QUICKER
IF YOU JUST LEFT.

15:34.893 --> 15:36.603
- YOU'RE THE ONES
THAT ARE GONNA BE LEAVING.

15:36.603 --> 15:38.188
- ASSUMING YOUR BULLSHIT WILL
STANDS UP IN COURT.

MAKE IT LIVABLE.

15:49.741 --> 15:51.117
BOYS, START UPSTAIRS.

16:10.595 --> 16:13.057

ABOUT OUR PETITION.

WE HAVE DEMANDED THAT
LINCOLN GROVE HIGH SCHOOL

16:15.642 --> 16:17.102
OFFER PROGRAMS
FOR SPECIAL STUDENTS

16:17.102 --> 16:19.145

WITH THEIR CLASSMATES.

16:19.145 --> 16:20.772
[applause]

16:20.772 --> 16:24.025
- AREN'T YOU GLAD WE CAME?
- YEAH.

16:24.025 --> 16:27.862
- GREAT, ALSO CONCERNING
THE "R" WORD,

16:27.862 --> 16:29.823
WE HAVE DEMANDED
A SCHOOL POLICY

16:29.823 --> 16:32.242
FORBIDDING STUDENTS AND FACULTY
FROM USING THAT WORD.

16:32.242 --> 16:34.661
- RETARD.
- EXCUSE ME.

16:34.661 --> 16:37.872
- RETARD.
YOU CAN'T EVEN SAY IT.

16:37.872 --> 16:41.042
SO HOW DO WE TALK ABOUT IT?

16:41.042 --> 16:44.046
- WE ALL KNOW YOUR OPINION
ON THIS, JEREMY.

16:44.046 --> 16:47.132
BUT RIGHT NOW
I'M THE ONE SPEAKING.

16:47.132 --> 16:48.591
- BROTHERS AND SISTERS,

16:48.591 --> 16:52.512
WORDS ONLY HAVE POWER
IF WE GIVE THEM POWER.

16:52.512 --> 16:57.642
WE MUST TAKE BACK
THE WORD "RETARD."

16:57.642 --> 16:59.644
MAKE IT OURS.

16:59.644 --> 17:02.772
- SWEETHEART, THE REST OF US
FIND THE WORD OFFENSIVE.

17:02.772 --> 17:05.150
- I'M NOT YOUR SWEETHEART,
BITCH.

17:05.150 --> 17:06.233
[all gasp]

17:06.233 --> 17:08.153
- MRS. KANDAGE,
I KNOW YOU MEAN WELL,

17:08.153 --> 17:09.737
BUT MANY OF US HERE
THINK IT'S TIME

17:09.737 --> 17:13.242
THAT WE RECLAIM
AND REDEFINE THE WORD.

17:13.242 --> 17:15.326
AND SINCE NORMIES
DON'T GET CALLED "RETARD,"

17:15.326 --> 17:17.287
THEY DON'T HAVE
A SAY IN THIS.

17:17.287 --> 17:19.497
- NORMIES DO NOT GET A SAY.

17:19.497 --> 17:21.165
- WHAT'S A "NORMIE?"

17:21.165 --> 17:22.834
- I THINK IT'S SLANG
FOR NON-RETARDS.

17:22.834 --> 17:25.462
- HEY, FABIO, DO YOU MIND?
- SORRY.

17:25.462 --> 17:27.422
- I DON'T CARE HOW IT'S USED.

17:27.422 --> 17:29.799
I DON'T WANT ANYBODY CALLING
MY SON THAT WORD EVER.

17:29.799 --> 17:31.050
IT'S INCREDIBLY HURTFUL.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.927
- EVEN IF WE DID GET RID OF IT,

17:32.927 --> 17:35.305
SOMEONE WILL JUST THINK UP
ANOTHER WAY OF SAYING IT.

17:35.305 --> 17:37.307
- THAT'S RIGHT.
THE QUEERS TOOK BACK THEIR WORD.

17:37.307 --> 17:39.726
- IT'S DIFFERENT.
- HOW IS IT DIFFERENT?

17:39.726 --> 17:41.311
IT'S NOT LIKE
RACE ISSUES DISAPPEAR

17:41.311 --> 17:42.437
IF PEOPLE STOP SAYING NIGGER.

17:42.437 --> 17:43.521
- SHUT THE FUCK UP!

17:43.521 --> 17:44.898
I CAN SAY IT, YOU CAN'T.

17:44.898 --> 17:47.233
- RETARDS,
WE MUST BAN TOGETHER.

17:47.233 --> 17:50.153
- THE WAY TO GET RESPECT
IS TO TAKE RESPECT,

17:50.153 --> 17:52.114
AND NORMIES CAN HELP US
GET THAT MESSAGE OUT.

17:52.114 --> 17:54.199
RAISE YOUR HAND

DURING GROUP SHARE YOU SAID
YOU'RE TWO YEARS SOBER,

19:44.642 --> 19:46.185
UNLESS I MISUNDERSTOOD.

19:46.185 --> 19:48.187
- NO, THAT'S RIGHT.
TWO YEARS TODAY.

19:48.187 --> 19:50.357
- OH, ONLY SIX WEEKS FOR ME.

19:50.357 --> 19:51.816
IT HASN'T BEEN EASY.

19:51.816 --> 19:55.028
I WAS DOWNING
CLEANING PRODUCTS, MOUTHWASH.

19:55.028 --> 19:57.155
- YOU EVER TRY STERNO?
- LOVE STERNO.

19:57.155 --> 20:00.158

WHAT PASSES FOR ALCOHOLISM

20:00.158 --> 20:01.368
WITH THIS GROUP.

20:06.497 --> 20:08.249
AM I WHINING ABOUT IT?

20:08.249 --> 20:11.377
OR THE GUY THAT LOST HIS JOB
AND BANGED HIS SISTER-IN-LAW?

20:11.377 --> 20:14.088
WHERE I COME FROM,
THAT'S FRIDAY NIGHT.

20:14.088 --> 20:16.382
[both chuckle]

20:16.382 --> 20:17.884
- BUT YOU'VE BEEN SOBER
TWO YEARS.

20:17.884 --> 20:19.385
THAT'S AMAZING.

20:19.385 --> 20:21.304
- BUT IT'S BECAUSE
YOU DON'T NEED BOOZE

20:21.304 --> 20:24.140
TO FILL THE GAPING HOLE
IN YOUR LIFE.

20:24.140 --> 20:26.225
IT'S ABOUT BEING
IN THE MOMENT.

20:26.225 --> 20:27.435
A MEATBALL SUB.

20:27.435 --> 20:29.228
A BEARS GAME
ON THE TELEVISION.

20:29.228 --> 20:30.438
SIMPLE PLEASURES.

20:30.438 --> 20:32.482
- SIMPLE PLEASURES, RIGHT.

20:32.482 --> 20:35.276
FRANK,
I'M CHRIS OR CHRISTOPHER.

20:35.276 --> 20:37.236
I HOPE YOU DON'T MIND
IF I ASK.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.863
WOULD YOU BE MY SPONSOR?

20:38.863 --> 20:41.366
- WOULD I--
- SPONSOR ME IN THE PROGRAM.

20:41.366 --> 20:44.243
MY PREVIOUS SPONSOR MOVED OUT
AND WENT TO LEESBURG.

20:44.243 --> 20:45.912
THAT'S IN FLORIDA.

20:45.912 --> 20:48.290
- RIGHT, RIGHT.
BUT HERE'S THE THING.

20:48.290 --> 20:49.666
MUCH AS I'D LOVE TO HELP,

20:49.666 --> 20:53.294
AND INSPIRING
AS I WOULD NO DOUBT BE,

20:53.294 --> 20:56.506
YOUR BEST SPONSOR
IS YOURSELF.

20:56.506 --> 20:58.549
- I UNDERSTAND.

20:58.549 --> 21:00.344
TAKE CARE.

21:04.306 --> 21:07.350
- WAIT.

21:07.350 --> 21:10.395
YOU SAID YOUR LAST SPONSOR
MOVED OUT.

21:10.395 --> 21:11.854
WHAT, HE--
WHAT, HE LIVED WITH YOU?

21:11.854 --> 21:13.357
- YEAH.

21:13.357 --> 21:14.691
YOU LIVE IN A HOUSE,
AN APARTMENT, WHAT?

21:14.691 --> 21:16.317
- A HOUSE.

21:16.317 --> 21:19.112
- I'M SORRY, LET ME
INTRODUCE MYSELF PROPERLY.

21:19.112 --> 21:20.530
I'M FRANK GALLAGHER.

21:20.530 --> 21:22.366
TELL ME YOUR NAME AGAIN.

21:22.366 --> 21:23.700

21:23.700 --> 21:25.743

21:33.335 --> 21:35.586

21:38.923 --> 21:40.174
I'M GETTING OUT.

21:40.174 --> 21:41.467
I'M GETTING OUT.

21:41.467 --> 21:44.346
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

21:48.975 --> 21:50.560
- I'M SORRY, BUT NO ONE SPEAKING
ENGLISH AS A FIRST LANGUAGE

21:50.560 --> 21:51.561
SHOULD BE DOING THIS JOB.

21:51.561 --> 21:53.355
- THE MONEY'S GOOD.

21:53.355 --> 21:55.064
- NOT THAT GOOD.

21:55.064 --> 21:57.191
- SO MUCH FOR
"YOU, ME, WE."

21:57.191 --> 21:59.026
- I CAN FEEL COCKROACHES
UNDER MY SUIT.

21:59.026 --> 22:00.153
ON MY BACK!
HIT ME ON MY BACK!

22:00.153 --> 22:02.447
HIT ME ON MY--FUCK.

22:06.325 --> 22:08.077
- OH.

22:08.077 --> 22:11.122
OH, HEY, THESE CANDLES
ARE A NICE IDEA.

22:11.122 --> 22:12.915
- MOM BROUGHT 'EM.
- OH, SHE DID?

22:12.915 --> 22:15.334
- JUST LOOK AT ME.

22:15.334 --> 22:17.044
THAT'S IT.

22:17.044 --> 22:18.588
- OH, SHIT.

22:18.588 --> 22:20.173
- YOU'RE A STUD BULL,
AREN'T YOU, BABY?

22:20.173 --> 22:21.507
- OH, YEAH.

22:21.507 --> 22:24.510
- HOLD THAT THOUGHT.
MOM!

22:24.510 --> 22:26.804
JUMP IN BETWEEN US.
HURRY UP.

22:26.804 --> 22:28.973
- WASN'T SURE
WHEN TO BRING THIS UP,

22:28.973 --> 22:32.643
BUT MAYBE I COULD USE
A LITTLE WARM-UP THIS TIME.

22:32.643 --> 22:35.397
- WARMING UP,
LIKE A JOG AROUND THE BLOCK?

22:35.397 --> 22:37.148
'CAUSE IF YOU'RE ASKING KEV
TO GO DOWN ON YOU,

22:37.148 --> 22:39.025
I CAN TELL YOU RIGHT NOW
THAT IS NOT HAPPENING.

22:39.025 --> 22:41.778
- WOMEN ARE MORE LIKELY TO
CONCEIVE IF THEY HAVE AN ORGASM.

22:41.778 --> 22:43.279
I READ IT IN COSMO.

22:43.279 --> 22:45.448
IT PULLS THE SPERM UP INTO--

22:45.448 --> 22:47.200
- THE CONVERSATION IS
NOT HAPPENING ON THIS END,

22:47.200 --> 22:48.493
JUST SAYING.

22:51.496 --> 22:53.664
- HEY, SORRY I BAILED.
- DON'T BE SORRY.

22:53.664 --> 22:56.292
I'M SURE TONS OF GUYS WOULD
LEAVE THEIR GIRLFRIENDS ALONE

22:56.292 --> 22:57.877
TO SHOVEL BLOOD AND SHIT.

22:57.877 --> 22:59.629
- I WENT DOWN TO THE COFFEE
BEANERY AND GOT A JOB.

22:59.629 --> 23:01.423
- HOW MUCH PER HOUR?

23:01.423 --> 23:03.467
- I MEAN, YOU KNOW, NOT
AS MUCH AS THE CLEANING POSSE,

23:03.467 --> 23:05.218
BUT ALL THE COFFEE
YOU CAN DRINK.

23:05.218 --> 23:06.385
- FULL-TIME?
- CLOSE.

23:06.385 --> 23:07.804
- HOW CLOSE?
- PART-TIME.

23:07.804 --> 23:09.722
THERE ARE OPPORTUNITIES
FOR ADVANCEMENT.

23:09.722 --> 23:12.433
THE MANAGER WAS SAYING--

23:14.852 --> 23:17.772
- WE'VE RECONVENED
THE COUSIN PATRICK WAR COUNCIL.

23:17.772 --> 23:19.483
- NO LUCK ON THE LEGAL FRONT?

23:19.483 --> 23:21.400
- NO, IT TURNS OUT
IT'S PRETTY HARD TO PROVE

23:21.400 --> 23:24.529
THAT SOMEONE HAD DEMENTIA
WHEN THEY SIGNED A WILL.

23:24.529 --> 23:26.823
IN OUR CASE,
VERY FUCKING HARD.

23:26.823 --> 23:28.449
- BECAUSE SHE WAS ALREADY DEAD.

23:28.449 --> 23:30.409
- WHAT WAS OPTION TWO AGAIN?
- WE'RE ON THREE NOW.

23:30.409 --> 23:32.286
CONVINCE PATRICK TO BACK OFF.

23:32.286 --> 23:34.413
- OR OPTION FOUR,
KILL PATRICK.

23:34.413 --> 23:39.460
- BACK TO THREE.
CONVINCE HIM HOW?

23:39.460 --> 23:42.547
- WE GET MY BROTHERS TO GO
AROUND AND SCARE HIM A LITTLE.

23:42.547 --> 23:43.631
- NO WAY.

23:43.631 --> 23:45.424
ENOUGH WITH
THE BROTHERS MILKOVICH.

23:45.424 --> 23:46.926
- NOTHING FATAL.

23:46.926 --> 23:48.512
HIT HIM WITH A BAT
A COUPLE OF TIMES,

23:48.512 --> 23:49.846
A LITTLE PISTOL WHIPPING.

23:49.846 --> 23:51.556
THEY'LL WANT $500 FOR IT,

23:51.556 --> 23:53.474
BUT IF I HELP MICKEY
MOVE SOME METH NEXT WEEK,

23:53.474 --> 23:55.226
THEY'LL SETTLE FOR $200.

23:55.226 --> 23:56.769
- THAT'S A DISCOUNT BEATING.

23:56.769 --> 23:57.770
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

23:57.770 --> 23:59.188
- GUYS, WE CAN'T--

23:59.188 --> 24:02.275
- WE NEED A HOUSE.

24:07.572 --> 24:10.324
- NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I'LL BE SCRAPING BLOOD AND SHIT

24:10.324 --> 24:11.826
FROM UNDER MY FINGERNAILS,

24:11.826 --> 24:13.662
AND THEN I'LL BE AT V'S
GETTING DRUNK,

24:13.662 --> 24:15.788
PRETENDING I DIDN'T JUST
ORDER A HIT ON A RELATIVE.

24:15.788 --> 24:18.666
- ALL RIGHT.

24:22.795 --> 24:24.589
- FRANK, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

24:24.589 --> 24:26.716
- SHEILA, THIS IS CHRISTOPHER.

24:26.716 --> 24:28.843
AS HIS A.A. SPONSOR,

24:28.843 --> 24:30.761
I'M HELPING HIM TO WALK
THE STRAIGHT AND NARROW.

24:30.761 --> 24:33.389
- WELL, THAT'S NICE, BUT HOW CAN
YOU BE HIS SPONSOR WHEN YOU--

24:33.389 --> 24:35.850
- I SAID TO HIM, "IF YOU'RE
SERIOUS ABOUT RECOVERY,

24:35.850 --> 24:38.687
"YOU'RE GONNA NEED
24-HOUR-A-DAY OVERSIGHT.

24:38.687 --> 24:40.354
I'M JUST GONNA HAVE
TO MOVE IN WITH YOU."

24:40.354 --> 24:41.898
- REALLY?

24:41.898 --> 24:43.983
- THAT FRANK WOULD DO THIS,
DISRUPT HIS OWN LIFE...

24:43.983 --> 24:47.069
- ALL I ASK IN RETURN
IS YOUR SOBRIETY.

24:47.069 --> 24:49.530
HERE, TAKE THIS DOWN
TO YOUR VAN.

24:49.530 --> 24:50.531
- OH!

24:50.531 --> 24:52.283
NICE MEETING YOU.

24:52.283 --> 24:55.202
- OH, NICE TO MEET YOU.

24:55.202 --> 24:57.496
THANK YOU, FRANK.
GREAT JOB.

24:57.496 --> 24:59.999
- NEVER LET IT BE SAID
THAT FRANK GALLAGHER

24:59.999 --> 25:01.709
OUTSTAYS HIS WELCOME.

25:01.709 --> 25:06.297
- KAREN, LOOK WHAT THEY GAVE ME
WHEN I OFFERED TO VOLUNTEER.

25:06.297 --> 25:10.719
PAMPHLETS AND BUTTONS
AND A BANNER AND T-SHIRTS.

25:10.719 --> 25:12.470
WHY DON'T YOU
COME WITH ME TOMORROW?

25:12.470 --> 25:14.388
I'M GONNA HAVE A TABLE
OUTSIDE THE MARKET.

25:14.388 --> 25:17.266
- NO THANKS, MOM.
- CAN I ASK WHY NOT?

25:17.266 --> 25:19.101
- BECAUSE THEY CALL THEMSELVES
RETARD NATION.

25:19.101 --> 25:20.144
IT'S OFFENSIVE.

25:20.144 --> 25:21.687
- NO, WE'RE--WE'RE--

25:21.687 --> 25:24.065
WE'RE CHALLENGING SOCIETY'S
PRECONCEPTIONS.

25:24.065 --> 25:27.193
- THIS IS GENIUS.
"I AM A RETARD."

25:27.193 --> 25:29.571
- YEAH, BUT READ THE BACK.

25:29.571 --> 25:31.656
- "AND PROUD."
I'M GONNA NEED FIVE OF THESE.

25:31.656 --> 25:34.283
A LOT OF RETARDS
AT THE ALIBI.

25:34.283 --> 25:37.828
- FRANK, I'M NOT COMFORTABLE
WITH HOW YOU'RE USING THAT WORD.

25:37.828 --> 25:39.705
- RETARD?
YOU'RE SAYING IT.

25:39.705 --> 25:41.749
- YEAH, BUT YOU DON'T
HAVE DOWN'S SYNDROME.

25:41.749 --> 25:43.250
- NEITHER DO YOU.

25:43.250 --> 25:46.045
- I KNOW, BUT MY INTENT
IS TO DEFEND FREE SPEECH

25:46.045 --> 25:49.006
AND TO FURTHER PUBLIC
AWARENESS AND END HATE.

25:49.006 --> 25:52.802
AND YOUR INTENT
IS SIMPLY TO BE RUDE.

25:52.802 --> 25:55.596
- HELLO?

25:58.265 --> 26:00.726
V?

26:03.521 --> 26:04.606
OH!

UH, OH, SORRY.

26:06.691 --> 26:07.566
OH.

AHH.

26:09.652 --> 26:11.445
UGH, AH.

26:11.445 --> 26:15.241
- THAT THREW ME OFF.
PERISCOPE DOWN.

26:20.621 --> 26:23.207
- HEY.

26:23.207 --> 26:25.793
LOOK, YOU NEED TO BACK OFF
THE GALLAGHER HOUSE.

26:25.793 --> 26:29.005
IF YOU DON'T,
YOU'LL BE SORRY.

26:32.591 --> 26:36.137
- [groans]

26:36.137 --> 26:37.972
- FUCK SAKE.

26:37.972 --> 26:40.599

26:40.599 --> 26:41.642
YOU SURE IT'LL STOP ME?

26:41.642 --> 26:43.602
- YOU WANT TO FIND OUT?

26:43.602 --> 26:44.979
WHAT THE FUCK ARE YOU DOING?

26:44.979 --> 26:46.230
GET UP AND
KNOCK HIM ON HIS ASS.

26:46.230 --> 26:48.482
I GOT HIM COVERED.

26:51.277 --> 26:54.488
- I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET THE WIFE,
ELLEN.

26:55.698 --> 26:57.700
- THEY'RE REMOVING
THE TOILETS.

26:57.700 --> 26:59.493
- I'LL GET SOME BUCKETS.

26:59.493 --> 27:00.870
- I GUESS IT DIDN'T WORK OUT
WITH YOUR BROTHER.

27:00.870 --> 27:02.997
- MANDY, ARE WE GETTING
OUR MONEY BACK?

27:02.997 --> 27:05.667
- MINUS $100.
HE TOOK A CHAIN OFF MICKEY.

27:05.667 --> 27:06.959
- OVER THERE.

27:06.959 --> 27:08.753
YEAH, JUST LEAVE IT.

27:08.753 --> 27:10.713
- BYE, HONEY, OFF TO WORK.

27:10.713 --> 27:12.840
- WHY IS HE LEAVING
A TOILET IN OUR LIVING ROOM?

27:12.840 --> 27:14.967
- BYE, HONEY!
I'M OFF TO WORK!

27:14.967 --> 27:17.178

27:20.264 --> 27:22.850
BUT WILL WE BE FINE HERE

27:28.272 --> 27:29.690
MAYBE WE'LL GET LUCKY.

27:29.690 --> 27:32.443
IF NOT, I WILL FIND US
A PLACE TO LIVE, OKAY?

27:32.443 --> 27:34.528
PLEASE DROP LIAM AT V'S
ON YOUR WAY TO SCHOOL.

27:34.528 --> 27:36.030
EVERYONE ELSE,

27:36.030 --> 27:39.701
NO TRUANT GALLAGHERS TODAY.

27:39.701 --> 27:41.745
[hammers banging]

27:46.874 --> 27:50.044
- YOU KNOW, BEING GUARDIAN
DOESN'T MAKE YOU SUPER-MOM.

27:50.044 --> 27:52.296
- YOU NOTICED.

27:52.296 --> 27:55.800
- I'M JUST SAYING,
IT'S NOT ALL ON YOU.

27:59.595 --> 28:01.722
THANKS.

28:05.976 --> 28:10.189
[drill whirring]

28:10.189 --> 28:11.774
- HOW ARE YOU THIS MORNING?

28:11.774 --> 28:13.859
- NEVER BETTER.

28:13.859 --> 28:16.237
REPLACING THE TOILET
WITH A LOW-FLOW MODEL,

28:16.237 --> 28:17.530
MUCH MORE EFFICIENT.

28:17.530 --> 28:18.781
- I BET IT LOWERS
THE WATER BILL.

28:18.781 --> 28:21.826
- OH, WITHOUT QUESTION.

28:21.826 --> 28:25.538
- PATRICK, WE GOT OFF
ON THE WRONG FOOT.

28:25.538 --> 28:30.126
- SENDING MICKEY MILKOVICH OVER
WITH A BASEBALL BAT, HMM?

28:30.126 --> 28:33.337
IS THAT THE FOOT YOU MEAN?

28:33.337 --> 28:37.759
- IF WE LET YOU TAKE THE HOUSE,
WILL YOU RENT IT TO US?

28:37.759 --> 28:38.843
- SURE.

28:38.843 --> 28:40.970
CALL IT $1,800 A MONTH,

28:40.970 --> 28:43.347
FIRST, LAST, AND DEPOSIT.

28:43.347 --> 28:44.557
- YOU KNOW WE DON'T HAVE
THAT KIND OF--

28:44.557 --> 28:46.058
- NO?

28:46.058 --> 28:50.688
I THOUGHT LIVING IN SQUALOR
WAS A LIFESTYLE CHOICE.

28:54.776 --> 28:56.694
- IT'S JUST THAT WHEN WE FIRST
STARTED THIS WITH MOM,

28:56.694 --> 28:58.571
WE APPROACHED IT
LIKE A MEDICAL PROCEDURE,

28:58.571 --> 28:59.989
BUT THESE LAST FEW TIMES,
IS IT ME

28:59.989 --> 29:01.323
OR WAS SHE ACTING
LIKE SHE WAS ON A DATE?

29:01.323 --> 29:03.117
- SHE ALWAYS DRESSES NICE.

29:03.117 --> 29:04.869
- MUSK PERFUME,
GOLD TIPS.

29:04.869 --> 29:06.954
WHEN HAS SHE EVER WORN GOLD TIPS
TO OUR HOUSE, KEV?

29:06.954 --> 29:08.747
- LIKE I'D NOTICE.

29:08.747 --> 29:09.874
- SO YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT?

29:09.874 --> 29:12.543
- BABY, MAYBE SHE MADE
AN EXTRA EFFORT.

29:12.543 --> 29:14.044
- AHA!

29:14.044 --> 29:15.588
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH THAT?

29:15.588 --> 29:18.549
- LOW-CUT DRESS,
"FUCK-ME" PUMPS.

29:18.549 --> 29:21.177
- MAYBE SHE'S EXCITED
TO HAVE A GRANDCHILD,

29:21.177 --> 29:23.470
WANTS ME TO BE
PROPERLY MOTIVATED.

29:23.470 --> 29:24.763
- AND THAT DOESN'T
FREAK YOU OUT?

29:24.763 --> 29:26.098
- THIS WHOLE THING
FREAKS ME OUT,

29:26.098 --> 29:28.517
AND I'M TRYING
NOT TO THINK ABOUT IT.

29:28.517 --> 29:30.394
I'M LIKE
A PROFESSIONAL ATHLETE.

29:30.394 --> 29:33.105
IF I THINK, IT AFFECTS
MY PERFORMANCE.

29:33.105 --> 29:37.318
MY JOB IS TO NOT THINK.

29:48.329 --> 29:52.583
- FUCK! FUCK!

29:57.004 --> 29:58.672
IF YOU'RE GONNA
FOLLOW ME TO WORK,

29:58.672 --> 30:00.216
HOW ABOUT GIVING ME A RIDE?

30:00.216 --> 30:01.634
- NOT YOUR CHAUFFEUR, BRO.

30:01.634 --> 30:03.385
DON'T BURN THE MILK.

30:03.385 --> 30:04.803
IT'S NOT GOOD
WHEN YOU BURN IT.

30:04.803 --> 30:06.847
- JIM!

30:06.847 --> 30:11.019
ANDY FROM MED SCHOOL.

30:11.019 --> 30:12.853
I'M AT COUNTY GENERAL
DOWN THE STREET.

30:12.853 --> 30:14.813
- NO KIDDING.

30:14.813 --> 30:18.026
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

30:18.026 --> 30:21.820
- I LOVE THIS PLACE.
GREAT COFFEE.

30:21.820 --> 30:23.907
YOU'RE A WORKING MAN NOW, HUH?

30:23.907 --> 30:25.824
- OH, MANAGEMENT TRAINEE.

30:25.824 --> 30:27.911
YOU KNOW, THEY WON'T LET YOU
BUY A FRANCHISE

30:27.911 --> 30:28.994
TILL YOU RUN
ONE OF THEIR STORES.

30:28.994 --> 30:30.287
- NICE.

30:30.287 --> 30:34.208
I HEAR THESE PLACES
ARE A GOLD MINE.

30:34.208 --> 30:36.502
- WHAT CAN I GET YOU, MAN?

30:36.502 --> 30:39.380
- HEY, YOU KNOW ADAM BRITT,
NICK STATHIS, MARK?

30:39.380 --> 30:42.508
THEY'RE ALL DOING
RESIDENCIES IN CHICAGO.

30:42.508 --> 30:44.510
NICK'S ORTHO,
MARK'S A SURGEON.

30:44.510 --> 30:46.053
WE'RE GRABBING DINNER
TOMORROW NIGHT.

30:46.053 --> 30:47.263
YOU SHOULD JOIN US.

30:47.263 --> 30:48.347
- YEAH, SOUNDS FUN.

30:48.347 --> 30:49.848
BUT I'M NOT SURE IF I CAN.

30:49.848 --> 30:52.935
- THEY WOULD LOVE TO SEE YOU.
YOU GOTTA COME.

30:56.689 --> 31:01.277
UM, DOUBLE CAPPUCCINO
WITH NON-FAT.

31:09.243 --> 31:11.078
- I WAS GONNA WAIT
FOR THE LANDLORD,

31:11.078 --> 31:13.998
BUT SOMEBODY ALREADY
KICKED THE DOOR IN FOR US.

31:13.998 --> 31:17.126
- THAT'S CONSIDERATE.

31:17.126 --> 31:18.752
- AT LEAST
IT'S IN OUR PRICE RANGE.

31:18.752 --> 31:20.462
- BARELY.

31:20.462 --> 31:23.091
- WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE WE LIVE
IN THE GOLD COAST NOW.

31:23.091 --> 31:26.010
PLACE JUST NEEDS SOME PAINT,
A CASE OF ROACH MOTELS.

31:26.010 --> 31:27.971
DOWN THE ROAD,
MAYBE WE SAVE SOME MONEY

31:27.971 --> 31:31.890
AND FIND A HOUSE
BACK IN OUR OLD HOOD.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.392
- NEED A CRACK PIPE?

31:33.392 --> 31:35.102
- BETTER NOT TOUCH THAT.

31:35.102 --> 31:37.563
- TOUCH IT?
I'M READY TO SMOKE OUT OF IT.

31:41.150 --> 31:44.570
I GUESS I'LL CALL THE LANDLORD
AND TELL HIM WE'LL TAKE IT.

31:52.036 --> 31:54.538
- [retches]

32:02.212 --> 32:04.132
- I NEED YOU TO WATCH
YOUR BABY BROTHER.

32:04.132 --> 32:05.799
AND WHO'S THAT PUKING
ON HIS TIMBERLANDS?

32:05.799 --> 32:07.343
- COUSIN PATRICK.

32:07.343 --> 32:10.137
HE'S GOT NAUSEA,
SHORTNESS OF BREATH,

32:10.137 --> 32:14.933
BLOOD IN URINE,
SEVERE ILLNESS, AND DEATH.

32:14.933 --> 32:16.352
- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU READING?

32:16.352 --> 32:20.023
- RAT POISON.

32:24.193 --> 32:25.944
- HI! HI!

32:25.944 --> 32:28.072
WE ARE RETARD NATION.

32:28.072 --> 32:30.158
YEAH, WE'RE
A LOCAL ORGANIZATION,

32:30.158 --> 32:32.951
BUT AS THE NAME SUGGESTS,
WE ARE GOING NATIONAL.

32:32.951 --> 32:35.996
WE'RE PROMOTING THE IDEA
THAT PEOPLE WITH DOWN'S SYNDROME

32:35.996 --> 32:38.041
NEED TO RECLAIM
THEIR OWN IDENTITIES

32:38.041 --> 32:40.125
IN ORDER TO DEFINE THEMSELVES.

32:40.125 --> 32:43.045
SO IF YOU'D LIKE TO,
YOU CAN MAKE A DONATION

32:43.045 --> 32:44.755
OR IF YOU'D LIKE TO BUY
A T-SHIRT OR JUST GET SIGNED--

32:44.755 --> 32:46.423
- WHAT THE HELL IS THIS?

32:46.423 --> 32:49.385
- WELL, WE'RE A LOCAL
ORGANIZATION, RETARD NATION--

32:49.385 --> 32:50.969
- TAKE IT DOWN NOW.

32:50.969 --> 32:52.721
- SIR, I'M AFRAID
I CAN'T DO THAT.

32:52.721 --> 32:54.014
- LADY, YOU'RE NOT GONNA STAND
IN FRONT OF MY MARKET

32:54.014 --> 32:55.641
WITH THIS GODDAMN SIGN.

32:55.641 --> 32:57.267
PACK IT UP NOW OR I'LL DO IT,
ALL RIGHT?

32:57.267 --> 33:02.398
- SIR, WE WILL NOT
BE INTIMIDATED BY NORMIES.

33:02.398 --> 33:04.983
- BY WHAT?
- BY NORMIES.

33:04.983 --> 33:06.527
- GODDAMN IT,
GET THIS CRAP OUT OF HERE.

33:06.527 --> 33:07.945
- DON'T!
- ALL OF IT.

33:07.945 --> 33:09.238
MA'AM, I'M VERY SORRY--
- DON'T!

33:09.238 --> 33:11.824
- DO NOT TOUCH ME
IN FRONT OF MY MARKET.

33:11.824 --> 33:13.659
THIS IS HATE SPEECH.
GET YOUR HANDS OFF OF ME.

33:13.659 --> 33:16.328
- ME-TARD, YOU-TARD,
RETARD NATION.

33:19.790 --> 33:21.333
- SO THIS IS IT.

33:21.333 --> 33:26.880
IT'S ONLY A ONE-BEDROOM,
BUT I'M AT WORK A LOT.

33:26.880 --> 33:28.924
- CHRISTOPHER.
- YEAH, FRANK?

33:28.924 --> 33:31.218
- IN ORDER
FOR THE HEALING TO BEGIN,

33:31.218 --> 33:33.054
IT'S IMPORTANT
THAT YOU BE HONEST

33:33.054 --> 33:34.805
AND TELL ME
WHERE YOU HIDE YOUR BOOZE.

33:34.805 --> 33:36.223
UNDER THE CUSHIONS?
BACK OF THE CLOSET?

33:36.223 --> 33:37.641
I KNOW ALL THE TRICKS.

33:37.641 --> 33:40.144
- I THREW IT OUT.

33:40.144 --> 33:43.147
- DO YOU MIND IF I LOOK AROUND
IN CASE YOU MISSED A BOTTLE?

33:43.147 --> 33:45.482
- YEAH, YEAH, THAT'S SMART.

33:45.482 --> 33:47.025
- WHERE DO YOU WORK?

33:47.025 --> 33:48.944
- I'M A VET TECH FOR THE CITY.

33:48.944 --> 33:50.946
I DEAL WITH
STRAY CATS AND DOGS.

33:50.946 --> 33:52.656
- MEANING YOU KILL THEM?

33:52.656 --> 33:55.617
- IN VETERINARY PARLANCE,
IT'S CALLED "CONTROL."

33:55.617 --> 33:58.871
SOMETIMES I RESCUE
A BEAUTY LIKE BESSIE THERE.

33:58.871 --> 34:01.957
IT MAKES ME FEEL BETTER
ABOUT IT ALL.

34:01.957 --> 34:04.418
HEY, I'VE GOT
A SURPRISE FOR YOU.

34:04.418 --> 34:06.170
WHY DON'T I GRAB IT?

34:06.170 --> 34:08.839
- WHAT SORT OF SURPRISE?
- YOU'LL SEE!

34:16.013 --> 34:17.889
- HEY.

34:23.312 --> 34:25.731
YOU KNOW YOUR DOG IS DEAD,
RIGHT?

34:25.731 --> 34:30.194
- TAXIDERMY
IS A HOBBY OF MINE.

34:30.194 --> 34:33.197
- [sighs]

34:33.197 --> 34:35.991
SO WHEN YOU SAY RESCUE,

34:35.991 --> 34:37.743
YOU MEAN BRING THEM HOME
AND STUFF THEM,

34:37.743 --> 34:39.328
BECAUSE MOST PEOPLE
WHEN THEY USED THAT WORD--

34:39.328 --> 34:41.496
- MEATBALL SUBS!

34:41.496 --> 34:44.208
LIKE YOU SAID, REMEMBER?

34:44.208 --> 34:45.250
SIMPLE PLEASURES.

34:45.250 --> 34:46.585
LIVING IN THE MOMENT.

34:46.585 --> 34:48.170
- SOUNDS LIKE SOMETHING
I WOULD SAY.

34:48.170 --> 34:50.172
- YOU MENTIONED
YOU'RE A BEARS FAN.

34:50.172 --> 34:52.382
THERE'S NO GAME ON, BUT I'VE GOT
LAST SEASON'S HIGHLIGHTS.

34:52.382 --> 34:55.136
YOU EAT, I'LL CUE IT UP.

34:57.179 --> 34:58.263
YOU WANT A BLANKET?

34:58.263 --> 35:00.724
IT'S KIND OF CHILLY.

35:02.601 --> 35:04.853
- I HAVE A NEW RESPECT
FOR BARISTAS.

35:04.853 --> 35:06.230
IT TURNS OUT IT'S
A HIGHLY DEMANDING CRAFT.

35:06.230 --> 35:07.731
WHO KNEW?

35:07.731 --> 35:09.107
YOU KEEP BURNING THE SHIT
OUT OF YOUR--

35:09.107 --> 35:11.068
WHAT'S UP?

35:11.068 --> 35:13.278
- TELL HIM.

35:13.278 --> 35:17.241
- I KILLED PATRICK.

35:17.241 --> 35:18.992
- WHAT?

35:32.339 --> 35:34.174
- OPTION FOUR: KILL PATRICK.

35:34.174 --> 35:35.968
WHY SKIP AN OPTION?

35:35.968 --> 35:37.803
- THE WHOLE LIFE IN PRISON
THING, SWEETHEART.

35:37.803 --> 35:40.931
- I REALIZE YOU'VE HAD SKETCHY
PARENTAL ROLE MODELS, OKAY?

35:40.931 --> 35:42.808
BUT AS YOUR
NEWLY APPOINTED GUARDIAN,

35:42.808 --> 35:44.977
CAN WE AGREE THAT
OFFING PEOPLE IS NOT COOL?

35:44.977 --> 35:46.395
CAN WE GET ON
THE SAME PAGE WITH THAT?

35:46.395 --> 35:48.355
- YEAH.

35:48.355 --> 35:50.233
- IF THIS COMES BACK TO US,

35:50.233 --> 35:52.067
IF WE GET CHARGED
WITH HOMICIDE,

35:52.067 --> 35:55.821
DO YOU REALIZE
HOW SERIOUS THAT IS?

35:55.821 --> 35:57.365
WHAT?

35:57.365 --> 35:59.575
- LIAM.

35:59.575 --> 36:02.160
- OH, LIAM.

36:04.329 --> 36:06.248
- OH, GOT HIM IN TIME.

36:06.248 --> 36:08.125
- WE NEED TO COME UP
WITH AN EXPLANATION

36:08.125 --> 36:09.710
IN CASE THE COPS
TIE THIS TO US.

36:09.710 --> 36:13.213
LIKE WE HAVE RATS AND
CARL THREW POISON EVERYWHERE.

36:13.213 --> 36:15.341
- THAT WORKS.
- IT DOES?

36:15.341 --> 36:17.385
- ANYONE WHO KNOWS YOU
WILL KNOW IT'S NOT FAR-FETCHED.

36:17.385 --> 36:19.220
DEBBIE, GO GET EVERYONE SO
WE CAN GET OUR STORY STRAIGHT.

36:19.220 --> 36:21.555
- OKAY.

36:21.555 --> 36:23.765
- I'M RAISING A SOCIOPATH.

36:23.765 --> 36:25.642
- I'M SURE THAT YOUR COUSIN
WENT TO THE HOSPITAL,

36:25.642 --> 36:30.273
SO HE'LL PROBABLY LIVE.
HOPEFULLY.

36:32.233 --> 36:34.026
- MANDY,
I THOUGHT THAT WAS YOU.

36:34.026 --> 36:35.360
- WHAT THE FUCK YOU DOING HERE?

36:35.360 --> 36:37.029
- RE-ENROLLING.

36:37.029 --> 36:38.822
SO I KNOW YOU'RE SEEING LIP,

36:38.822 --> 36:41.199
BUT LIKE I TOLD HIM,
I THINK IT'S GREAT.

36:41.199 --> 36:43.243
- YOU TALKED TO LIP?

36:43.243 --> 36:46.246
- I CAME BY LAST TUESDAY
TO SAY HI.

36:46.246 --> 36:48.249
I DIDN'T COME INSIDE.

36:48.249 --> 36:49.791
LIP DIDN'T WANT ME INSIDE,

36:49.791 --> 36:51.877
BECAUSE, YOU KNOW,
HE DIDN'T WANT TO UPSET YOU.

36:51.877 --> 36:53.920
- WHY WOULD I BE UPSET?

36:53.920 --> 36:56.423
- OH, YOU WOULDN'T.

36:56.423 --> 36:58.133
FORGET IT.

36:58.133 --> 37:00.927
I JUST MEANT
I'M HAPPY FOR YOU GUYS.

37:04.389 --> 37:06.224
- LATTE.

37:06.224 --> 37:08.394
WAIT TILL YOU TRY
THESE PANCAKES.

37:08.394 --> 37:10.062
ORGANIC BLUEBERRIES.

37:10.062 --> 37:12.397
- YOU'RE ADJUSTING VERY WELL
FOR AN ADDICT.

37:12.397 --> 37:14.775
- THANKS TO YOU, SPONSOR.

37:14.775 --> 37:16.318
IF IT WEREN'T FOR YOU,

37:16.318 --> 37:19.863
THIS PLACE WOULD BE LITTERED
WITH WHISKEY BOTTLES.

37:19.863 --> 37:22.407
- WHAT WAS
YOUR DRINK OF CHOICE?

37:22.407 --> 37:23.617
- TERRY'S.

37:23.617 --> 37:25.869
- NEVER HEARD OF THAT.

37:25.869 --> 37:28.580
- TERRY'S, UH,
MALTED WHISKEY.

37:28.580 --> 37:31.292
- YOU MEAN MALT WHISKEY?
LIKE SINGLE MALT?

37:31.292 --> 37:33.585
- WELL, ALL KINDS OF MALT.

37:33.585 --> 37:36.296
GET UP IN THE MORNING
AND DRINK A FULL KEG OF BEER.

37:36.296 --> 37:38.715
MAN, WAS THAT BAD.

37:38.715 --> 37:42.010
- A KEG IS 15 GALLONS.

37:42.010 --> 37:43.595
I DIDN'T KNOW BETTER,

37:43.595 --> 37:46.723
I WOULD THINK
YOU'RE MAKING STUFF UP.

37:46.723 --> 37:51.312
OUR RELATIONSHIP IS BASED
ON HONESTY, CHRISTOPHER.

37:53.730 --> 37:55.941
- I TRIED TO DRINK ALCOHOL.

37:55.941 --> 37:58.361
I JUST DON'T LIKE THE TASTE.

37:58.361 --> 38:00.529
- JESUS CHRIST!
YOU'RE NOT AN ALCOHOLIC?

38:00.529 --> 38:02.490
- FORGIVE ME.

38:02.490 --> 38:04.783
- WELL, THEN WHY GO TO A.A.?
WHY HAVE ME AS YOUR SPONSOR?

38:04.783 --> 38:07.786
- PLEASE, FRANK,
PLEASE, DON'T MOVE OUT.

38:07.786 --> 38:10.455
EVERYTHING IS GOING
SO GOOD WITH US.

38:10.455 --> 38:12.499
I WON'T LIE TO YOU AGAIN.

38:12.499 --> 38:14.251
I PROMISE.

38:14.251 --> 38:15.585
I'LL MAKE US PRIME RIB.
