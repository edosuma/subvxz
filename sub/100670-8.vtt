EVE: Carolyn?

28:58.871 --> 29:00.370
CAROLYN: Eve, what are you
doing here?

29:00.539 --> 29:01.538
I'm helping...

29:02.308 --> 29:03.707
Villanelle.

29:03.976 --> 29:05.642
Of course. I'm surprised
she's not with...
(DOOR BUZZER SOUNDING)

29:09.415 --> 29:10.414
Shall I?

29:13.419 --> 29:14.518
What have you told her?

29:14.787 --> 29:16.386
PAUL: As I've explained
to you, Carolyn,

29:16.555 --> 29:17.421
he only knows me

29:17.757 --> 29:19.356
because I've been
working undercover.

29:19.458 --> 29:20.590
And you believe that?

29:20.693 --> 29:21.692
Sit down.

29:25.097 --> 29:26.096
No, next to him.

29:34.607 --> 29:35.672
Well...

29:36.275 --> 29:37.607
This is something new.

29:37.943 --> 29:40.410
Who's he?
Someone who's going to answer
a couple of questions.

29:40.713 --> 29:42.612
Carolyn, things will go
a lot easier for you

29:42.815 --> 29:44.248
if we just end this now.

29:45.885 --> 29:47.284
Just sit down, Paul!

29:50.256 --> 29:52.022
He's the one who's been
giving me orders.

29:52.191 --> 29:53.390
Who is he?

29:53.626 --> 29:56.560
KONSTANTIN: Whatever this is,
we can talk about it.

29:56.796 --> 29:58.428
Do you even know
how to use that?

29:58.631 --> 30:00.364
Please, give the gun to me.

30:01.534 --> 30:02.866
(GUNSHOT)

30:06.071 --> 30:08.372
Oh! Seems to be working.

30:08.607 --> 30:10.106
You're going
to burn for this.

30:10.209 --> 30:11.241
Both of you.

30:11.343 --> 30:12.308
Shut up, Paul!

30:12.444 --> 30:15.512
What is going on?
I have no idea.

30:15.648 --> 30:16.980
What happened?
I'm fine.

30:17.183 --> 30:18.248
CAROLYN: If you two
are going to be here,

30:18.517 --> 30:19.883
the least you can do
is just sit down and be quiet.

30:27.927 --> 30:28.859
KONSTANTIN: Carolyn,

30:29.128 --> 30:31.628
you know I've been
working for The Twelve...

30:31.797 --> 30:34.464
FSB, the British
Security Service.

30:34.700 --> 30:36.133
That's can't be
a surprise for you.

30:36.468 --> 30:38.468
PAUL: This is why
we've been investigating him.

30:38.671 --> 30:39.803
He's betrayed everyone.

30:40.105 --> 30:42.339
He's even been
stealing millions
from The Twelve.

30:42.541 --> 30:45.142
Don't listen to him,
he is The Twelve.

30:45.211 --> 30:46.643
(CHUCKLES)

30:46.779 --> 30:48.045
He's The Twelve?
Yes.

30:48.781 --> 30:49.846
Do you know Helene?

30:50.049 --> 30:51.448
Helen who runs
the Treasury Desk?

30:51.550 --> 30:52.682
No, Helene,

30:52.852 --> 30:55.385
she's my boss... Ex-boss.

30:55.588 --> 30:56.820
It was a very toxic work place.

30:57.489 --> 30:58.689
Mmm.

30:59.024 --> 31:02.826
Did you order Dasha Duzran
to kill my husband? Did you?

31:03.028 --> 31:03.960
I don't know

31:04.230 --> 31:05.529
any of the people
you are talking about.

31:06.265 --> 31:08.298
Dasha is dead.

31:09.902 --> 31:11.100
Dead?

31:11.270 --> 31:12.469
Will you all be quiet?

31:14.473 --> 31:16.139
Carolyn, what is
this about?

31:17.142 --> 31:18.275
Justice.

31:19.912 --> 31:21.377
Why did you kill my son?

31:21.513 --> 31:22.646
What?
(GASPS)

31:22.781 --> 31:24.580
Ha! That's ridiculous.

31:24.783 --> 31:27.517
I saw the footage.
What footage?

31:27.786 --> 31:30.821
On the day Kenny died,
you were there.

31:31.957 --> 31:32.923
You were there?

31:35.628 --> 31:36.627
I can explain.

31:38.197 --> 31:39.863
Please do.

31:40.065 --> 31:41.865
Because I'm very close
to pulling this trigger.

31:47.172 --> 31:48.171
I'm waiting.

31:53.946 --> 31:54.945
Tell her.

31:58.150 --> 31:59.216
We were at the rooftop.

31:59.885 --> 32:00.883
You killed Kenny?

32:01.086 --> 32:02.986
VILLANELLE:
He doesn't kill people.

32:03.188 --> 32:04.855
He makes other
people do it for him.

32:09.395 --> 32:10.394
Why were you there?

32:11.263 --> 32:14.063
Because of Paul.
What?

32:14.300 --> 32:16.700
Kenny was getting
too close to The Twelve.

32:16.869 --> 32:20.237
I told him,
if he wanted to live,

32:20.539 --> 32:22.272
he needed to come
working for The Twelve.

32:23.409 --> 32:24.675
I was trying to save him.

32:25.978 --> 32:27.878
I promise.
PAUL: He's lying.

32:28.047 --> 32:31.014
I was trying to save him,
I swear!

32:31.650 --> 32:32.683
Yet, he died.

32:33.585 --> 32:34.785
He got scared.

32:35.487 --> 32:37.053
He kept stepping back.

32:37.656 --> 32:39.122
I tried to stop him,

32:39.391 --> 32:41.325
but he fell before
I could do anything.

32:45.097 --> 32:46.229
I wish I could believe you.

32:48.167 --> 32:49.933
You have to believe me.

32:50.102 --> 32:52.335
The problem is,
Konstantin, I don't.

32:52.571 --> 32:53.670
I wouldn't have...
CAROLYN: Wouldn't have?

32:53.872 --> 32:55.338
Why wouldn't you?

32:55.607 --> 32:59.776
I wouldn't do that
to someone I once...
Don't say "loved".

33:02.514 --> 33:03.679
It's true.

33:04.350 --> 33:05.649
Get down on your knees.

33:13.325 --> 33:14.925
(SHUDDERS)

33:21.066 --> 33:21.964
I loved you.

33:22.167 --> 33:23.366
You never loved me.
Not even close.

33:23.669 --> 33:25.702
Get down on
your knees!
Carolyn, think of what...

33:27.473 --> 33:28.505
Why just...

33:29.541 --> 33:30.574
Why just me?

33:31.543 --> 33:32.642
Why not him
as well?

33:32.811 --> 33:33.710
CAROLYN: Because I don't
care about him.

33:33.946 --> 33:34.977
He doesn't mean
anything to me.

33:35.147 --> 33:36.780
But I did care about you.

33:45.491 --> 33:46.690
This was inevitable.

33:48.093 --> 33:49.259
(BREATHES SHAKILY)

34:27.533 --> 34:29.833
It should have been you.

No.

34:59.364 --> 35:00.363
Why not?

35:02.734 --> 35:03.767
You're not family.

35:12.344 --> 35:13.810
Why kill him?

35:14.113 --> 35:15.846
He had everything we wanted
to know about The Twelve.

35:16.148 --> 35:18.048
He was a traitor.
Mo found the evidence

35:18.317 --> 35:19.816
and Paul had him
killed for it.

35:19.985 --> 35:20.884
He was a source.

35:21.086 --> 35:23.019
It was Konstantin
who killed your son.

35:23.088 --> 35:24.187
No, Eve.

35:25.557 --> 35:27.624
I am responsible
for Kenny's death.

35:27.860 --> 35:29.826
Look, it was not
your fault.

35:30.095 --> 35:32.629
Kenny was killed trying
to expose The Twelve.

35:32.831 --> 35:34.764
Isn't that what
we're all trying to do?

35:35.367 --> 35:36.299
What I've come
to realise

35:36.535 --> 35:38.234
is that one cannot
destroy The Twelve.

35:38.437 --> 35:40.137
You should
listen to her, Eve.

35:41.273 --> 35:43.707
CAROLYN: I know it.
She knows it.

35:43.909 --> 35:46.543
Maybe it's time
you went cold turkey?

35:49.715 --> 35:50.747
What do you mean?

35:53.152 --> 35:54.817
(SCOFFS)

35:55.020 --> 35:56.419
You know precisely
what I mean.

36:14.106 --> 36:15.138
I like turkey.

36:15.474 --> 36:17.374

trot along after her?

when you choose.

37:11.330 --> 37:13.396
No, I killed Dasha.

37:13.665 --> 37:15.665
I hit her over the head
with a golf club.

37:15.767 --> 37:16.833
I crushed her...

37:18.003 --> 37:19.302
With my foot.

37:19.471 --> 37:20.670
You did?
Uh-huh.

we both did.

who would think that are?

37:38.290 --> 37:39.756
Who?
Us.

I don't want
to do it any more.

38:21.199 --> 38:22.899
You only thought
you were.
No.

38:24.069 --> 38:25.401
I had a life.

38:25.604 --> 38:28.071
I had a husband
and a house

38:28.373 --> 38:30.640
and a chicken.
You still want that stuff?

38:35.147 --> 38:36.779

of my future,

38:36.882 --> 38:38.181
