00:12.178 --> 00:14.848
<i>As the first century
of the Targaryen dynasty</i>

00:14.848 --> 00:16.599
<i>came to a close,</i>

00:16.683 --> 00:18.810
<i>the health of the Old King,</i>

00:18.810 --> 00:21.438
<i>Jaehaerys, was failing.</i>

00:23.732 --> 00:25.900
<i>In those days, House Targaryen</i>

00:25.984 --> 00:28.319
<i>stood at the height of its strength</i>

00:28.403 --> 00:31.322
<i>with 10 adult dragons under its yoke.</i>

00:32.198 --> 00:34.784
<i>No power in the world
could stand against it.</i>

00:36.161 --> 00:38.621
<i>King Jaehaerys reigned
over nearly 60 years</i>

00:38.705 --> 00:40.707
<i>of peace and prosperity.</i>

00:40.707 --> 00:43.877
<i>But tragedy had claimed both his sons,</i>

00:43.877 --> 00:46.087
<i>leaving his succession in doubt.</i>

00:46.796 --> 00:49.340
<i>So, in the year 101,</i>

00:49.424 --> 00:51.843
<i>the Old King called a Great Council</i>

00:51.843 --> 00:53.470
<i>to choose an heir.</i>

00:55.054 --> 00:57.974
<i>Over a thousand lords made
the journey to Harrenhal.</i>

00:59.434 --> 01:02.979
<i>Fourteen succession claims were heard</i>

01:02.979 --> 01:05.607
<i>but only two were truly considered:</i>

01:06.816 --> 01:10.570
<i>Princess Rhaenys Targaryen,
the King's eldest descendant,</i>

01:10.570 --> 01:14.282
<i>and her younger cousin,
Prince Viserys Targaryen,</i>

01:14.282 --> 01:17.118
<i>the King's eldest male descendant.</i>

01:23.208 --> 01:28.254
It is declared by all lords paramount

01:28.338 --> 01:31.883
and lords vassal of the Seven Kingdoms,

01:33.092 --> 01:36.304
that Prince Viserys Targaryen

01:36.304 --> 01:39.891
be made Prince of Dragonstone.

01:39.891 --> 01:42.185
<i>Rhaenys, a woman,</i>

01:42.185 --> 01:45.188
<i>would not inherit the Iron Throne.</i>

01:47.816 --> 01:50.151
<i>The lords instead chose Viserys,</i>

01:51.778 --> 01:52.904
<i>my father.</i>

01:56.491 --> 01:58.493
<i>Jaehaerys called the Great Council</i>

01:58.493 --> 02:02.288
<i>to prevent a war being
fought over his succession.</i>

02:02.372 --> 02:04.374
<i>For he knew the cold truth.</i>

02:04.374 --> 02:06.751
<i>The only thing that could tear down</i>

02:06.835 --> 02:09.504
<i>the House of the Dragon,</i>

02:09.504 --> 02:10.713
<i>was itself.</i>

04:02.700 --> 04:05.328
<i>Dohaerﾄ《,</i> Syrax!

04:08.873 --> 04:09.791
<i>Umbﾄ《.</i>

04:11.668 --> 04:12.585
<i>Rybﾄ《!</i>

04:24.681 --> 04:26.265
Welcome back, Princess.

04:26.349 --> 04:27.892
I trust your ride was pleasant.

04:27.976 --> 04:30.061
Try not to look too relieved, ser.

04:30.061 --> 04:31.270
I am relieved.

04:31.354 --> 04:34.649
Every time that golden beast
brings you back unspoiled,

04:34.649 --> 04:36.651
it saves my head from a spike.

04:37.944 --> 04:39.529
Syrax is growing quickly.

04:39.529 --> 04:41.739
She'll soon be as large as Caraxes.

04:41.823 --> 04:43.700
That's almost large enough to saddle two.

04:43.700 --> 04:47.495
I believe I'm quite content
as a spectator, thank you.

04:49.789 --> 04:51.666
<i>Dohaerﾄ《.</i>

04:53.418 --> 04:54.419
<i>Naejot!</i>

06:22.215 --> 06:23.508
Rhaenyra.

06:25.927 --> 06:29.097
You know I don't like you to go flying
while I'm in this condition.

06:29.097 --> 06:31.557
You don't like me to go flying
while you're in any condition.

06:33.601 --> 06:36.562
- Your Grace.
- Good morrow, Alicent.

06:36.646 --> 06:37.939
Did you sleep?

06:37.939 --> 06:39.982
- I slept.
- How long?

06:41.109 --> 06:43.277
I don't need mothering, Rhaenyra.

06:43.361 --> 06:45.613
Well, here you are,
surrounded by attendants,

06:45.613 --> 06:47.448
all focused on the babe.

06:48.116 --> 06:49.867
Someone has to attend to you.

06:51.619 --> 06:55.748
You will lie in this bed
soon enough, Rhaenyra.

06:55.832 --> 06:59.335
This discomfort is how we serve the realm.

06:59.335 --> 07:02.630
I'd rather serve as a knight
and ride to battle and glory.

07:05.550 --> 07:07.885
We have royal wombs, you and I.

07:09.637 --> 07:11.722
The childbed is our battlefield.

07:13.766 --> 07:16.727
We must learn to face it with a stiff lip.

07:18.104 --> 07:20.022
Now take a bath.

07:20.106 --> 07:22.024
You stink of dragon.

07:24.235 --> 07:27.363
So, I said to him, "Well, I believe you
might be looking up the wrong end."

07:31.492 --> 07:32.994
My lords.

07:32.994 --> 07:34.996
The growing alliance among the Free Cities

07:34.996 --> 07:38.166
has taken to styling
itself "the Triarchy."

07:38.166 --> 07:40.251
They have massed on Bloodstone

07:40.251 --> 07:43.671
and are presently ridding the Stepstones
of its pirate infestation.

07:43.671 --> 07:46.299
Well, that sounds suspiciously
like good news, Lord Corlys.

07:46.299 --> 07:48.467
A man called Craghas Drahar

07:48.551 --> 07:51.721
has styled himself the prince-admiral
of this Triarchy.

07:52.889 --> 07:55.099
They call him "The Crabfeeder"

07:55.183 --> 07:58.102
due to his inventive methods
of punishing his enemies.

07:58.186 --> 08:01.397
And are we meant to weep
for dead pirates?

08:01.397 --> 08:03.566
- No, Your Grace.
- Rhaenyra, you're late.

08:03.566 --> 08:05.693
King's cupbearer must not be late.

08:05.693 --> 08:08.696
- Leaves people wanting for cups.
- I was visiting Mother.

08:09.614 --> 08:12.241
On dragonback?

08:12.909 --> 08:15.494
Hey, Your Grace,
at Prince Daemon's urging,

08:15.578 --> 08:18.122
the crown has invested significant capital

08:18.206 --> 08:21.626
in the re-training and re-equipping
of his City Watch.

08:21.626 --> 08:26.005
I thought you might urge your brother
to fill his seat on the council

08:26.005 --> 08:31.010
and provide an assessment of his progress
as commander of the Watch.

08:31.010 --> 08:33.638
Do you think Daemon
is distracted by his present tasks?

08:33.638 --> 08:35.681
And that his thoughts
and energies are occupied?

08:35.765 --> 08:39.018
Well, one would hope so, considering
the associated costs.

08:39.018 --> 08:42.438
Then let us all consider
your gold well-invested, Lord Beesbury.

08:42.438 --> 08:45.566
I would urge that you not allow
this Triarchy much latitude

08:45.650 --> 08:47.818
in the Stepstones, Your Grace.

08:47.902 --> 08:50.988
If those shipping lanes should fall,
it will beggar our ports.

08:51.072 --> 08:53.699
The crown has heard
your report, Lord Corlys,

08:53.783 --> 08:56.410
and takes it under advisement.

09:01.165 --> 09:05.086
Shall we discuss the Heir's Tournament,
Your Grace?

09:05.086 --> 09:07.672
I would be delighted.

09:07.672 --> 09:09.757
Will the maesters' name day
prediction hold, Mellos?

09:09.757 --> 09:13.344
You must understand that these things
are mere estimations, my King,

09:13.344 --> 09:16.555
but we have all been
poring over the moon charts,

09:16.639 --> 09:20.685
and we feel that our forecast
is as accurate as it can be.

09:20.685 --> 09:23.562
The cost of the tournament
is not negligible.

09:23.646 --> 09:27.358
Perhaps we might delay
until the child is in hand?

09:27.358 --> 09:29.360
Most of the lords and knights

09:29.360 --> 09:32.280
are certainly on their way to King's
Landing already. To turn them back now--

09:32.280 --> 09:34.282
The tourney will take
the better part of a week.

09:34.282 --> 09:37.159
Before the games are over,
my son will be born,

09:37.243 --> 09:38.869
and the whole realm will celebrate.

09:38.953 --> 09:41.998
We have no way of predicting
the sex of the child.

09:41.998 --> 09:44.875
Of course, no maester's capable
of rendering an opinion

09:44.959 --> 09:46.460
free of conditions, are they now?

09:47.586 --> 09:49.505
There's a boy in the Queen's belly.

09:50.423 --> 09:51.340
I know it.

09:53.259 --> 09:55.136
And my heir will soon
put all of this damnable

09:55.136 --> 09:57.138
hand-wringing to rest himself.

10:00.391 --> 10:02.727
He passed through the Red Keep's gates
at first light.

10:02.727 --> 10:04.520
Does my father know he's here?

10:04.520 --> 10:05.938
- No.
- Good.

10:14.071 --> 10:15.615
Gods be good.

10:16.240 --> 10:17.783
It's all right, ser.

10:39.680 --> 10:40.639
Aye.

11:11.253 --> 11:12.797
I bought you something.

11:18.302 --> 11:19.637
Do you know what it is?

11:20.971 --> 11:22.515
It's Valyrian steel.

11:23.766 --> 11:25.309
Like Dark Sister.

11:29.271 --> 11:30.398
Turn around.

11:45.204 --> 11:46.122
Now,

11:47.581 --> 11:50.918
you and I both own a small piece
of our ancestry.

12:00.928 --> 12:02.263
Did you read it?

12:02.263 --> 12:04.098
Of course, I read it.

12:04.098 --> 12:06.475
When Princess Nymeria
arrived in Dorne,

12:06.559 --> 12:08.394
who did she take to husband?

12:08.394 --> 12:09.854
A man.

12:09.854 --> 12:11.439
What was his name?

12:11.439 --> 12:13.274
Lord Something.

12:13.274 --> 12:14.900
If you answer with
"Lord Something,"

12:14.984 --> 12:16.735
Septa Marlow will be furious.

12:16.819 --> 12:18.737
She's funny when she's furious.

12:21.991 --> 12:24.493
You're always like this
when you're worried.

12:24.577 --> 12:25.995
Like what?

12:25.995 --> 12:27.413
Disagreeable.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.836
You're worried your father
is about to overshadow you

12:33.836 --> 12:35.337
with a son.

12:35.421 --> 12:37.173
I only worry for my mother.

12:38.299 --> 12:40.634
I hope for my father that he gets a son.

12:41.427 --> 12:43.971
As long as I can recall,
it's all he's wanted.

12:44.972 --> 12:46.974
You want him to have a son?

12:46.974 --> 12:48.934
I want to fly with you on dragonback,

12:49.018 --> 12:52.021
see the great wonders
across the Narrow Sea, and eat only cake.

12:52.021 --> 12:54.648
- I'm being serious.
- I never jest about cake.

12:54.732 --> 12:56.859
You aren't worried about your position?

12:56.859 --> 12:59.487
I like this position.
It's quite comfortable.

13:03.407 --> 13:06.952
- Where are you going?
- Home. The hour has grown late.

13:07.953 --> 13:09.955
Princess Nymeria led her Rhoynar

13:10.039 --> 13:12.124
across the Narrow Sea on 10,000 ships

13:12.208 --> 13:14.210
to flee their Valyrian pursuers.

13:14.210 --> 13:17.379
She took Lord Mors Martell
of Dorne to husband

13:17.463 --> 13:19.298
and burned her own fleet off Sunspear

13:19.298 --> 13:21.383
to show her people that
they were finished running.

13:23.677 --> 13:26.013
- What are you doing?
- So you remember.

13:26.889 --> 13:29.975
- If the Septa sees this book, then--
- Fuck the Septa.

13:30.059 --> 13:31.477
Rhaenyra!

13:44.198 --> 13:45.699
Is it healing?

13:45.783 --> 13:48.619
It has grown slightly, Your Grace.

13:50.663 --> 13:52.915
Can you say yet what it is?

13:52.915 --> 13:55.167
We've sent inquiries to the Citadel.

13:55.251 --> 13:57.378
They are searching
the texts for similar cases.

13:57.378 --> 13:59.922
It's a small cut from sitting the throne.

13:59.922 --> 14:00.881
It's nothing.

14:01.924 --> 14:05.511
The King has been under heavy stresses
preparing for the birth.

14:06.595 --> 14:11.183
Bad humors of the mind
can adversely affect the body.

14:11.267 --> 14:14.395
Whatever it is, it needs to be kept quiet.

14:17.982 --> 14:19.441
We should leech it again, maester.

14:19.525 --> 14:22.069
It's a wound that refuses to heal,
Grand Maester.

14:23.571 --> 14:25.281
Might I suggest cauterization?

14:25.281 --> 14:28.951
Cauterization would be a wise
course of treatment, Your Grace.

14:29.660 --> 14:31.579
- It will be painful.
- Fine.

14:33.122 --> 14:34.081
Fine.

14:47.094 --> 14:49.513
You spend more time in that bath
than I do on the throne.

14:49.597 --> 14:51.557
This is the only place

14:51.557 --> 14:53.976
I can find comfort these days.

14:56.478 --> 14:57.396
It's tepid.

14:58.063 --> 15:00.566
It's as warm as the maesters will allow.

15:00.566 --> 15:03.402
Don't they know dragons prefer heat?

15:04.278 --> 15:07.197
After this miserable pregnancy,

15:07.281 --> 15:09.950
I wouldn't be surprised if
I hatched an actual dragon.

15:10.034 --> 15:13.120
Then he will be loved and cherished.

15:14.163 --> 15:17.124
Rhaenyra has already declared
that she is to have a sister.

15:17.124 --> 15:18.626
Really?

15:18.626 --> 15:21.629
- She even named her.
- Dare I ask?

15:22.546 --> 15:24.256
Visenya.

15:24.340 --> 15:27.843
She chose a dragon's egg for the cradle
that she said reminded her of Vhagar.

15:27.843 --> 15:29.345
Gods be good.

15:29.345 --> 15:31.972
This family already has its Visenya.

15:33.932 --> 15:36.602
Has there been any word
from your dear brother?

15:36.602 --> 15:39.521
Not since I named him
Commander of the City Watch.

15:40.147 --> 15:43.192
I'm sure he will reemerge for the tourney.

15:43.192 --> 15:45.778
He could never stay away from the lists.

15:45.778 --> 15:47.196
The tourney

15:47.196 --> 15:50.616
to celebrate the firstborn son
that we presently do not have.

15:51.784 --> 15:55.371
You do understand nothing
will cause the babe to grow a cock

15:55.371 --> 15:57.247
if it does not already possess one?

15:57.956 --> 16:00.542
This child is a boy, Aemma.

16:00.626 --> 16:02.127
I'm certain of it.

16:02.711 --> 16:05.464
I've never been more certain of anything.

16:08.926 --> 16:10.219
The dream.

16:11.303 --> 16:13.222
It was clearer than a memory.

16:15.557 --> 16:18.018
Our son was born wearing
Aegon's iron crown.

16:20.229 --> 16:23.607
When I heard the sound
of thundering hooves,

16:23.691 --> 16:26.902
splintering shields, and ringing swords,

16:26.902 --> 16:29.905
and I placed our son
upon the Iron Throne

16:31.198 --> 16:33.659
as the bells of the Grand Sept tolled

16:33.659 --> 16:35.994
and all the dragons roared as one.

16:39.456 --> 16:40.999
Born wearing a crown?

16:41.667 --> 16:43.377
Gods spare me,

16:43.377 --> 16:45.796
birth is unpleasant enough as it is.

16:54.888 --> 16:58.392
This is the last time, Viserys.

17:01.270 --> 17:03.105
I've lost one babe in the cradle,

17:03.105 --> 17:05.107
had two stillbirths, and two pregnancies

17:05.107 --> 17:07.317
ended well before their term.

17:10.112 --> 17:12.781
That's five in twice as many years.

17:14.491 --> 17:17.369
I know it is my duty
to provide you an heir,

17:17.453 --> 17:20.998
and I'm sorry if I have
failed you in that. I am.

17:24.918 --> 17:27.796
But I've mourned
all the dead children I can.

17:48.776 --> 17:51.695
Commander on the floor!

17:57.659 --> 18:01.079
When I took command of the Watch,
you were stray mongrels,

18:02.748 --> 18:05.000
starving and undisciplined.

18:06.752 --> 18:08.253
Now,

18:08.337 --> 18:10.631
you're a pack of hounds.

18:10.631 --> 18:13.175
You're sated and honed for the hunt.

18:16.970 --> 18:19.890
My brother's city has fallen into squalor.

18:21.266 --> 18:24.937
Crime of every breed
has been allowed to thrive.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.148
No longer.

18:28.232 --> 18:30.275
Beginning tonight,
King's Landing will learn

18:30.359 --> 18:32.110
to fear the color gold.

19:18.657 --> 19:19.908
Get up!

19:39.803 --> 19:40.929
Raper!

19:43.223 --> 19:46.226
No! No! No! No! No!

19:54.067 --> 19:55.736
Thief!

19:55.736 --> 19:56.862
No!

20:03.076 --> 20:04.077
Murderer!

20:20.719 --> 20:24.056
<i>It was an unprecedented
roundup of criminals of every ilk.</i>

20:24.056 --> 20:29.144
<i>Your brother made a public show of it,
meting out the summary judgments himself.</i>

20:29.144 --> 20:34.274
I'm told they needed a two-horse cart
to haul away the resulting dismemberments

20:34.358 --> 20:35.400
when it was done.

20:35.484 --> 20:37.402
Gods be good.

20:38.487 --> 20:40.280
The Prince cannot be allowed to act

20:40.364 --> 20:43.116
with this kind of unchecked impunity.

20:45.369 --> 20:47.287
- Brother.
- Daemon.

20:49.122 --> 20:52.042
Carry on. You were saying
something about my impunity.

20:54.628 --> 20:58.048
You are to explain your doings
with the City Watch.

21:00.467 --> 21:03.595
Your new "gold cloaks" made quite
the impression last night, didn't they?

21:03.679 --> 21:04.930
Did they?

21:04.930 --> 21:08.266
The City Watch is not a sword
to be wielded at your whim.

21:08.350 --> 21:10.352
They're an extension of the crown.

21:10.352 --> 21:12.396
The Watch was enforcing the crown's laws.

21:12.396 --> 21:14.147
Wouldn't you agree, Lord Strong?

21:15.399 --> 21:16.858
My Prince, I don't think--

21:16.942 --> 21:19.486
Making a public spectacle
of wanton brutality

21:19.486 --> 21:21.363
is hardly in line with our laws.

21:21.363 --> 21:23.031
Nobles from every corner of the realm

21:23.115 --> 21:25.033
are right now descending
upon King's Landing

21:25.117 --> 21:26.660
for my brother's tourney.

21:26.660 --> 21:29.288
Do you want them mugged, raped, murdered?

21:29.288 --> 21:32.207
You mightn't know this unless
you left the safety of the Red Keep,

21:32.207 --> 21:34.668
but much of King's Landing
is seen by the smallfolk

21:34.668 --> 21:37.379
as lawless and terrifying.

21:39.756 --> 21:42.009
Our city should be safe
for all its people.

21:42.926 --> 21:43.844
I agree.

21:44.469 --> 21:48.640
I just hope you don't have to maim
half of my city to achieve this.

21:48.724 --> 21:50.142
Time will tell.

21:52.811 --> 21:56.898
We installed Prince Daemon
as commander to promote law and order.

21:56.982 --> 21:59.359
The criminal element
should fear the City Watch.

21:59.443 --> 22:01.111
Thank you for your support, Lord Corlys.

22:01.111 --> 22:02.988
If only the Prince would
show the same devotion

22:02.988 --> 22:05.949
to his lady wife as he does his work,
Your Grace.

22:06.033 --> 22:09.703
You've not been seen in the Vale
or at Runestone for quite some time.

22:09.703 --> 22:11.997
I think my bronze bitch
is happier for my absence.

22:11.997 --> 22:13.707
Lady Rhea is your wife,

22:13.707 --> 22:16.126
a good and honorable lady of the Vale.

22:16.126 --> 22:19.129
In the Vale, men are said to fuck sheep
instead of women.

22:19.129 --> 22:21.673
I can assure you, the sheep are prettier.

22:21.757 --> 22:22.758
Dear me.

22:22.758 --> 22:25.510
You made a vow before the Seven
to honor your wife in marriage.

22:25.594 --> 22:28.472
Well, I'd gladly give Lady Rhea to you,
Lord Hightower,

22:28.472 --> 22:31.183
if you're in want
of a woman to warm your bed.

22:31.183 --> 22:34.186
Your own lady wife passed recently.

22:36.146 --> 22:37.773
Did she not?

22:37.773 --> 22:38.774
Otto.

22:42.277 --> 22:44.613
Perhaps you aren't ready
to move on just yet.

22:45.447 --> 22:48.033
You know how my brother
makes sport of provoking you.

22:48.867 --> 22:50.410
Must you indulge him?

22:54.581 --> 22:56.375
My apologies, Your Grace.

22:56.375 --> 22:59.669
This council has, at great expense,

22:59.753 --> 23:02.631
bettered the City Watch
to your exacting standards.

23:02.631 --> 23:05.675
Enforce my laws, but understand,

23:05.759 --> 23:09.387
any further performances like last night's
will be answered.

23:13.308 --> 23:15.227
Understood, Your Grace.

23:28.657 --> 23:31.118
King's Landing has been in decline since
my grandmother passed.

23:31.118 --> 23:33.120
In the end,

23:34.371 --> 23:37.833
this new City Watch
might be a good thing.

24:23.879 --> 24:26.214
What troubles you, my Prince?

24:32.220 --> 24:34.139
I could bring in another.

24:34.681 --> 24:36.224
Perhaps a maiden.

24:37.475 --> 24:38.768
I have several.

24:40.896 --> 24:43.773
I could even arrange one with silver hair.

24:49.946 --> 24:52.657
You are Daemon Targaryen.

24:52.741 --> 24:55.869
Rider of Caraxes. Wielder of Dark Sister.

24:56.620 --> 24:59.164
The King cannot replace you.

25:11.760 --> 25:13.303
Be welcome!

25:14.221 --> 25:16.806
I know many of you have
traveled long leagues

25:16.890 --> 25:19.059
to be at these games.

25:19.059 --> 25:22.270
But I promise,
you will not be disappointed.

25:23.730 --> 25:26.816
When I look at
the fine knights in these lists,

25:26.900 --> 25:30.445
I see a group without equal
in our histories.

25:31.905 --> 25:36.993
And this great day
has been made more auspicious

25:37.077 --> 25:40.664
by the news
that I am happy to share:

25:41.873 --> 25:44.834
Queen Aemma has begun her labors!

25:48.380 --> 25:52.300
May the luck of the Seven
shine upon all combatants!

26:24.916 --> 26:26.668
A mystery knight?

26:26.668 --> 26:28.878
No, a Cole, of the Stormlands.

26:28.962 --> 26:30.297
I've never heard of House Cole.

26:30.297 --> 26:33.216
Princess Rhaenys Targaryen!

26:33.300 --> 26:35.343
I would humbly ask for the favor

26:35.427 --> 26:37.262
of "The Queen Who Never Was."

26:43.893 --> 26:45.353
Good fortune to you, cousin.

26:45.437 --> 26:47.814
I would gladly take it
if I thought I needed it.

26:54.321 --> 26:57.407
You could have
Baratheon's tongue for that.

26:57.407 --> 26:59.576
Tongues will not change the succession.

26:59.576 --> 27:01.286
Let them wag.

27:07.834 --> 27:11.212
Lord Stokeworth's daughter
is promised to that young Tarly squire.

27:11.296 --> 27:12.839
Lord Massey's son?

27:12.839 --> 27:15.633
They're to be married
as soon as he wins his knighthood.

27:15.717 --> 27:16.760
Best get on with it.

27:18.386 --> 27:21.806
I heard that Lady Elinor is hiding
a swollen belly beneath her dress.

27:44.746 --> 27:47.123
What do you know about
this Ser Criston Cole, Ser Harrold?

27:47.207 --> 27:50.710
I'm told Ser Criston is common-born,
son of Lord Dondarrion's steward.

27:50.794 --> 27:53.755
But other than that,
and the fact that he's just unhorsed

27:53.755 --> 27:55.799
both of the Baratheon lads,

27:55.799 --> 27:57.592
I really couldn't say.

28:15.944 --> 28:19.489
Prince Daemon of House Targaryen,

28:19.489 --> 28:20.990
Prince of the City,

28:21.074 --> 28:24.828
will now choose his first opponent!

29:02.073 --> 29:04.659
For his first challenge,

29:04.659 --> 29:07.745
Prince Daemon Targaryen chooses

29:07.829 --> 29:10.331
Ser Gwayne Hightower of Oldtown,

29:10.415 --> 29:13.126
eldest son of the Hand of the King.

29:25.889 --> 29:28.433
Five dragons on Daemon.

30:41.422 --> 30:44.342
- Nicely done, Uncle.
- Thank you, Princess.

30:45.635 --> 30:49.347
Now, I'm fairly certain
I can win these games, Lady Alicent.

30:49.347 --> 30:52.767
Having your favor would all but assure it.

31:06.990 --> 31:08.491
Good luck, my Prince.

31:36.686 --> 31:39.272
- What's happening?
- The infant is in breech, Your Grace.

31:39.272 --> 31:41.858
All attempts to turn the babe have failed.

31:44.193 --> 31:45.987
- Do something for her!
- We've given her as much

31:45.987 --> 31:48.990
milk of the poppy as we can
without risking the child.

31:48.990 --> 31:50.575
Your Queen is a strong woman.

31:50.575 --> 31:53.953
She's fighting with all her might,
but it may not be enough.

31:54.037 --> 31:55.830
No!

31:55.830 --> 31:57.040
Aemma.

31:58.625 --> 32:00.627
Aemma, I'm here.

32:00.627 --> 32:01.961
I'm here.

32:03.129 --> 32:05.048
I'm here. It's all right.

32:05.048 --> 32:07.091
- It's all right.
- I don't wanna do this.

32:07.175 --> 32:08.885
You're going to be all right.

32:09.469 --> 32:11.012
You're going to be all right.

32:36.371 --> 32:37.246
Kill him!

32:37.330 --> 32:39.791
And the day grows ugly.

32:43.419 --> 32:47.548
I wonder if this is how we should
celebrate the birth of our future king.

32:47.632 --> 32:49.759
With wanton violence.

32:49.759 --> 32:52.220
It's been 70 years
since King Maegor's end.

32:52.220 --> 32:54.138
These knights are as green
as summer grass.

32:54.222 --> 32:55.848
None have known real war.

32:57.100 --> 32:58.685
Their lords sent them to the tourney field

32:58.685 --> 33:01.562
with fists full of steel
and balls full of seed,

33:01.646 --> 33:03.648
and we expect them to act
with honor and grace.

33:04.399 --> 33:07.235
It's a marvel that war
didn't break out at first blood.

33:29.924 --> 33:31.092
Mellos.

33:32.176 --> 33:33.302
Your Grace.

33:34.929 --> 33:36.055
If you would.

33:46.065 --> 33:47.650
During a difficult birth,

33:47.734 --> 33:52.071
it sometimes becomes necessary
for the father

33:53.030 --> 33:54.949
to make an impossible choice.

33:56.325 --> 33:58.077
Well, speak it.

33:58.161 --> 34:02.415
To sacrifice one or to lose them both.

34:03.916 --> 34:07.003
There is a chance that
we can save the child.

34:07.003 --> 34:09.088
A technique is taught at the Citadel,

34:09.172 --> 34:11.090
which involves cutting
directly into the womb

34:11.174 --> 34:13.176
to free the infant.

34:13.176 --> 34:15.928
- But the resulting blood loss--
- Seven Hells, Mellos.

34:28.483 --> 34:30.610
You can save the child?

34:30.610 --> 34:34.572
We must either act now
or leave it with the gods.

34:46.375 --> 34:49.420
Ser Criston Cole will now tilt against

34:49.504 --> 34:53.424
Ser Daemon Targaryen, Prince of the City!

36:04.954 --> 36:06.873
- Viserys.
- Yes?

36:08.875 --> 36:11.002
They're going to bring the babe out now.

36:34.859 --> 36:35.985
I love you.

36:44.243 --> 36:46.495
- What is happening?
- No, it's all right.

36:46.579 --> 36:49.415
No, what is happening?

36:50.291 --> 36:51.959
- Viserys, what--
- No, it's all right.

36:52.043 --> 36:53.836
- What are you doing?
- They're going to bring the babe out.

36:53.920 --> 36:55.004
How are they--

36:55.004 --> 36:56.714
- It's all right.
- Viserys, please.

36:56.714 --> 36:58.966
- It's all right.
- No, I'm scared.

36:59.050 --> 37:00.593
- Don't be scared.
- What is happening?

37:00.593 --> 37:02.261
Don't be scared.
They're going to bring the babe out.

37:02.345 --> 37:04.680
- Oh no.
- It's all right.

37:04.764 --> 37:06.682
They're going to bring the babe out.

37:08.351 --> 37:10.937
No! No! No!

37:10.937 --> 37:15.066
- I'm making the first incision.
- No, no, no!

37:15.608 --> 37:18.569
Viserys, no! Please!

37:18.653 --> 37:20.947
- No, no, no!
- Don't be scared.

37:45.179 --> 37:46.430
Sword!

37:46.514 --> 37:47.974
Prince Daemon Targaryen

37:47.974 --> 37:51.435
wishes to continue in a contest of arms!

39:41.754 --> 39:43.089
Yield.

39:44.590 --> 39:45.549
Yield.

40:19.542 --> 40:21.377
Gods. He's Dornish.

40:22.086 --> 40:24.630
I was hoping to ask
for the Princess's favor.

40:36.725 --> 40:39.186
I wish you luck, Ser Criston.

40:39.270 --> 40:40.604
Princess.

40:51.949 --> 40:54.285
Congratulations, Your Grace.

40:54.994 --> 40:56.370
You have a son.

41:00.541 --> 41:01.834
It's a boy?

41:01.834 --> 41:04.253
A new heir, Your Grace.

41:10.009 --> 41:12.553
<i>Had you and the Queen chosen a name?</i>

41:16.098 --> 41:17.224
Baelon.

42:35.219 --> 42:37.137
They're waiting for you.

43:33.110 --> 43:34.236
<i>Dracarys.</i>

44:13.734 --> 44:15.152
- Where's Rhaenyra?
- Your Grace.

44:15.152 --> 44:18.072
This is the last thing
any of us wish to discuss

44:18.072 --> 44:19.198
at this dark hour,

44:19.198 --> 44:21.492
but I consider the matter urgent.

44:21.492 --> 44:22.493
What matter?

44:23.911 --> 44:25.454
That of your succession.

44:26.163 --> 44:29.708
These recent tragedies
have left you without an obvious heir.

44:29.792 --> 44:31.627
The King has an heir, my Lord Hand.

44:31.627 --> 44:34.129
Despite how difficult
this time is, Your Grace,

44:34.213 --> 44:37.341
I feel it important
the succession be firmly in place

44:37.341 --> 44:38.884
for the stability of the realm.

44:38.884 --> 44:41.136
The succession is already set

44:41.220 --> 44:42.721
by precedent and by law.

44:42.805 --> 44:44.348
Shall we say his name?

44:46.975 --> 44:48.519
Daemon Targaryen.

44:48.519 --> 44:51.522
If Daemon were to remain
the uncontested heir,

44:51.522 --> 44:54.108
it could destabilize the realm.

44:54.108 --> 44:56.110
The realm? Or this council?

44:56.110 --> 44:58.987
No one here can know what Daemon would do
were he king,

44:59.071 --> 45:01.698
but no one can doubt his ambition.

45:01.782 --> 45:04.451
Look at what he did
with the "gold cloaks."

45:04.535 --> 45:06.578
The City Watch is fiercely loyal to him.

45:06.662 --> 45:10.457
- An army 2,000 strong.
- An army you gave him, Otto.

45:10.541 --> 45:14.503
I named Daemon Master of Laws,
but you said he was a tyrant.

45:14.503 --> 45:17.047
As Master of Coin,
you said he was a spendthrift

45:17.131 --> 45:18.632
that would beggar the realm.

45:18.632 --> 45:20.926
Putting Daemon in command
of the City Watch

45:20.926 --> 45:22.469
was your solution!

45:22.553 --> 45:24.555
A half-measure, Your Grace.

45:24.555 --> 45:27.641
The truth is, Daemon should be
far away from this court.

45:27.641 --> 45:29.852
Daemon is my brother.

45:29.852 --> 45:31.061
My blood.

45:32.104 --> 45:34.064
And he will have his place at my court.

45:34.148 --> 45:36.150
Let him keep his place
at court, Your Grace,

45:36.150 --> 45:40.404
but if the gods should visit
some further tragedy on you,

45:40.404 --> 45:43.657
- either by design or by accident.
-"Design"?

45:44.241 --> 45:45.617
What are you saying?

45:45.701 --> 45:47.995
My brother would murder me, take my crown?

45:49.746 --> 45:50.664
Are you?

45:52.624 --> 45:53.542
Please.

45:54.793 --> 45:58.464
Daemon has ambition, yes,
but not for the throne.

45:58.464 --> 46:00.257
He lacks the patience for it.

46:00.257 --> 46:02.050
The gods have yet to make a man who

46:02.134 --> 46:05.471
lacks the patience for absolute power,
Your Grace.

46:05.471 --> 46:09.558
Under such circumstances,
it would not be an aberration

46:09.558 --> 46:11.977
for the King to name a successor.

46:11.977 --> 46:13.979
Well, who else would have a claim?

46:20.652 --> 46:22.821
The King's firstborn child.

46:22.905 --> 46:25.032
Rhaenyra? A girl?

46:26.783 --> 46:28.744
No queen has ever sat the Iron Throne.

46:28.744 --> 46:30.954
That is only by tradition
and precedent, Lord Strong.

46:31.038 --> 46:33.248
If order and stability
so concerns this council,

46:33.332 --> 46:37.169
then perhaps we shouldn't break 100 years
of it by naming a girl heir.

46:37.169 --> 46:41.006
Daemon would be a second Maegor, or worse.

46:41.006 --> 46:43.717
He is impulsive and violent.

46:43.717 --> 46:45.677
It is the duty of this council

46:45.761 --> 46:49.056
to protect the King
and the realm from him.

46:50.140 --> 46:52.518
I'm sorry, Your Grace,
but that is the truth as I see it,

46:52.518 --> 46:54.144
and I know that others here agree.

46:54.228 --> 46:58.190
I will not be made to choose
between my brother and my daughter.

46:58.190 --> 47:00.108
You wouldn't have to,
Your Grace.

47:00.192 --> 47:02.236
There are others who would have a claim.

47:02.236 --> 47:04.279
Such as your wife, Lord Corlys?

47:04.363 --> 47:06.657
-"The Queen Who Never Was"?
- Rhaenys was the only child

47:06.657 --> 47:07.908
of Jaehaerys' eldest son.

47:07.908 --> 47:09.993
She had a strong claim
at the Great Council,

47:10.077 --> 47:12.079
and she already has a male heir.

47:12.079 --> 47:14.540
Just moments ago,
you announced your support for Daemon!

47:14.540 --> 47:16.333
If we cannot agree on an heir,
then how can we expect--

47:16.333 --> 47:18.835
My wife and son are dead!

47:20.295 --> 47:25.217
I will not sit here and suffer crows
that come to feast on their corpses!

47:58.709 --> 48:02.045
Send a raven to Oldtown. Straight away.

48:04.881 --> 48:05.799
My Lady.

48:16.643 --> 48:17.978
My darling.

48:27.237 --> 48:28.780
How's Rhaenyra?

48:31.450 --> 48:32.993
She lost her mother.

48:34.661 --> 48:37.205
The Queen was well-loved by all.

48:39.374 --> 48:42.502
I found myself thinking
of your own mother today.

48:49.176 --> 48:51.720
- How is His Grace?
- Very low.

48:53.263 --> 48:55.098
Which is why I sent for you.

49:00.437 --> 49:01.980
I thought you might go to him,

49:03.190 --> 49:04.733
offer him comfort.

49:07.319 --> 49:08.445
In his chambers?

49:15.202 --> 49:17.120
I wouldn't know what to say.

49:17.746 --> 49:18.830
Stop that.

49:20.916 --> 49:22.834
He'll be glad of a visitor.

49:31.093 --> 49:33.637
You might wear one of
your mother's dresses.

50:10.257 --> 50:12.801
The Lady Alicent Hightower, Your Grace.

50:18.598 --> 50:20.559
What is it, Alicent?

50:20.559 --> 50:23.186
I thought I might come
and look in on you, Your Grace.

50:24.855 --> 50:26.189
I brought a book.

50:28.567 --> 50:30.485
That's very kind, thank you.

50:35.615 --> 50:37.951
It's a favorite of mine.

50:37.951 --> 50:40.579
I do know how passionate
you are for the histories.

50:41.955 --> 50:43.874
Yes, I am.

51:01.308 --> 51:02.601
When my mother died,

51:04.603 --> 51:07.189
people only ever spoke to me in riddles.

51:08.899 --> 51:10.942
All I wanted was for someone
to say that they were sorry

51:11.026 --> 51:12.569
for what happened to me.

51:16.782 --> 51:18.700
I'm very sorry, Your Grace.

52:06.581 --> 52:07.499
Thank you.

52:09.751 --> 52:12.087
The King's sole heir once again.

52:14.005 --> 52:16.716
Might we drink to our future?

52:18.301 --> 52:20.011
Quiet!

52:20.095 --> 52:22.639
Your Prince will speak!

52:25.809 --> 52:27.686
Silence!

52:33.692 --> 52:35.610
<i>Before we begin, Your Grace,</i>

52:35.694 --> 52:40.031
I have a report I feel compelled to share.

52:41.908 --> 52:43.034
Last night,

52:43.952 --> 52:46.621
Prince Daemon bought out
one of the pleasure houses

52:46.705 --> 52:48.248
on the Street of Silk,

52:49.332 --> 52:52.586
to entertain officers of the City Watch

52:52.586 --> 52:54.212
and other friends of his.

52:58.008 --> 53:00.176
King and Council have
long rued my position

53:00.260 --> 53:02.304
as next in line for the throne.

53:03.722 --> 53:06.266
But dream and pray as they all might,

53:06.266 --> 53:09.269
it seems I'm not so easily replaced.

53:11.563 --> 53:14.232
The gods give just as the gods take away.

53:14.316 --> 53:16.276
<i>He toasted Prince Baelon.</i>

53:16.276 --> 53:17.485
To the King's son.

53:18.570 --> 53:20.488
Styling him

53:21.323 --> 53:23.825
"The Heir for a Day."

53:30.749 --> 53:34.669
<i>I corroborated this report
with three separate witnesses.</i>

53:34.753 --> 53:38.882
<i>The evening was, by all
accounts, a celebration.</i>

53:41.134 --> 53:44.054
You cut the image
of the conqueror, brother.

53:45.597 --> 53:46.848
Did you say it?

53:49.100 --> 53:50.685
I don't know what you mean.

53:50.769 --> 53:52.228
You will address me as "Your Grace,"

53:52.312 --> 53:55.398
or I will have my Kingsguard
cut out your tongue.

53:58.944 --> 54:03.281
"The Heir for a Day." Did you say it?

54:12.874 --> 54:15.794
We must all mourn
in our own way, Your Grace.

54:17.295 --> 54:20.632
My family has just been destroyed.

54:21.758 --> 54:24.719
But instead of being
by my side, or Rhaenyra's,

54:24.803 --> 54:27.639
you chose to celebrate your own rise!

54:27.639 --> 54:30.850
Laughing with your whores
and your lickspittles!

54:33.144 --> 54:36.231
You have no allies at court but me!

54:36.231 --> 54:38.775
I have only ever defended you!

54:38.775 --> 54:41.444
Yet everything I've given you,
you've thrown back in my face.

54:41.528 --> 54:43.446
You've only ever tried to send me away.

54:43.530 --> 54:46.241
To the Vale, to the City Watch,

54:46.241 --> 54:48.284
anywhere but by your side.

54:48.368 --> 54:50.328
Ten years you've been king,

54:50.412 --> 54:53.415
and yet not once have you
asked me to be your Hand!

54:53.415 --> 54:56.710
- Why would I do that?
- Because I'm your brother.

54:57.669 --> 54:59.796
And the blood of the dragon runs thick.

54:59.796 --> 55:01.881
Then why do you cut me so deeply?

55:01.965 --> 55:03.133
I've only ever spoken the truth.

55:03.133 --> 55:05.969
I see Otto Hightower for what he is.

55:05.969 --> 55:09.014
- An unwavering and loyal Hand?
- A cunt.

55:10.056 --> 55:12.058
A second son who stands to inherit nothing

55:12.142 --> 55:13.560
he doesn't seize for himself.

55:13.560 --> 55:15.729
Otto Hightower is a more honorable man

55:15.729 --> 55:17.939
- than you could ever be.
- He doesn't protect you.

55:18.023 --> 55:19.983
- I would.
- From what?

55:19.983 --> 55:21.192
Yourself.

55:24.946 --> 55:27.699
You're weak, Viserys.

55:30.326 --> 55:31.786
And that council of leeches knows it.

55:31.870 --> 55:33.788
They all prey on you for their own ends.

55:38.793 --> 55:40.879
I have decided to name a new heir.

55:40.879 --> 55:43.506
- I'm your heir.
- Not anymore.

55:45.008 --> 55:48.636
You are to return to Runestone
and your lady wife at once,

55:48.720 --> 55:51.806
and you are to do so without quarrel

55:51.890 --> 55:53.850
by order of your King.

56:08.615 --> 56:10.158
Your Grace.

57:09.759 --> 57:10.885
Father.

57:15.223 --> 57:19.769
Balerion was the last living creature
to have seen Old Valyria before the Doom.

57:22.438 --> 57:24.482
Its greatness and its flaws.

57:25.066 --> 57:27.610
When you look at the dragons,
what do you see?

57:27.694 --> 57:28.736
What?

57:28.820 --> 57:30.655
You haven't spoken a word to me since

57:30.655 --> 57:32.157
mother's funeral,

57:32.157 --> 57:35.201
- and now you send your Kingsguard down.
- Answer me.

57:37.537 --> 57:38.872
It's important.

57:39.622 --> 57:40.957
What do you see?

57:48.882 --> 57:51.426
- I suppose I see us.
- Tell me.

57:52.594 --> 57:56.472
Everyone says Targaryens
are closer to gods than to men,

57:56.556 --> 57:59.100
but they say that because of our dragons.

58:00.727 --> 58:03.271
Without them,
we're just like everyone else.

58:05.899 --> 58:09.903
The idea that we control the dragons

58:09.903 --> 58:11.529
is an illusion.

58:13.323 --> 58:16.242
They're a power man should
never have trifled with.

58:17.785 --> 58:20.163
One that brought Valyria its doom.

58:20.163 --> 58:23.750
If we don't mind our own histories,
it will do the same to us.

58:24.375 --> 58:26.920
Targaryen must understand
this to be King

58:28.379 --> 58:29.505
or Queen.

58:33.801 --> 58:35.345
I'm sorry, Rhaenyra.

58:36.387 --> 58:39.349
I have wasted the years
since you were born

58:39.349 --> 58:41.142
wanting for a son.

58:53.029 --> 58:55.073
<i>You are the very best of your mother.</i>

58:58.243 --> 59:00.411
And I believe it, I know she did,

59:00.495 --> 59:02.830
that you could be a great ruling queen.

59:02.914 --> 59:04.582
Daemon is your heir.

59:06.251 --> 59:08.920
<i>Daemon was not made
to wear the crown.</i>

59:09.462 --> 59:11.005
But I believe that you were.

59:12.131 --> 59:14.884
<i>Corlys of House Velaryon,</i>

59:14.968 --> 59:19.264
Lord of the Tides and Master of Driftmark.

59:19.264 --> 59:21.766
I, Corlys Velaryon,

59:22.558 --> 59:25.728
Lord of the Tides and Master of Driftmark,

59:25.812 --> 59:27.897
<i>promise to be faithful to King Viserys</i>

59:27.981 --> 59:30.817
<i>and his named heir, the Princess Rhaenyra.</i>

59:30.817 --> 59:33.069
<i>I pledge fealty to them</i>

59:33.069 --> 59:35.154
<i>and shall defend them against all enemies</i>

59:35.238 --> 59:37.782
<i>in good faith and without deceit.</i>

59:42.203 --> 59:45.123
I swear this by the old gods and the new.

59:47.917 --> 59:50.044
<i>This is no trivial gesture, Rhaenyra.</i>

59:50.628 --> 59:52.797
A dragon's saddle is one thing,

59:52.797 --> 59:56.009
but the Iron Throne is the most
dangerous seat in the realm.

59:56.926 --> 59:58.886
I, Lord Hobert Hightower,

59:58.970 --> 1:00:01.306
Beacon of the South,
Defender of the Citadel,

1:00:01.306 --> 1:00:02.849
and Voice of Oldtown,

1:00:02.849 --> 1:00:05.643
promise to be faithful to King Viserys

1:00:05.727 --> 1:00:08.938
and his named heir, the Princess Rhaenyra.

1:00:11.691 --> 1:00:13.276
<i>I pledge fealty to them</i>

1:00:13.276 --> 1:00:15.278
<i>and shall defend them against all enemies</i>

1:00:15.278 --> 1:00:18.281
<i>in good faith and without deceit.</i>

1:00:18.823 --> 1:00:21.826
<i>I swear this by the old gods and the new.</i>

1:00:28.875 --> 1:00:30.209
Give me your hand.

1:00:44.849 --> 1:00:46.726
I, Boremund Baratheon,

1:00:47.935 --> 1:00:51.064
promise to be faithful to King Viserys.

1:00:53.274 --> 1:00:56.944
<i>There's something else
that I need to tell you.</i>

1:00:57.028 --> 1:00:59.197
<i>It might be difficult
for you to understand,</i>

1:00:59.197 --> 1:01:01.074
<i>but you must hear it.</i>

1:01:01.824 --> 1:01:03.284
Our histories,

1:01:03.368 --> 1:01:04.577
they tell us that Aegon looked across

1:01:04.577 --> 1:01:06.496
the Blackwater from Dragonstone,

1:01:06.496 --> 1:01:09.123
saw a rich land ripe for the capture.

1:01:10.541 --> 1:01:13.461
But ambition alone is not
what drove him to conquest.

1:01:14.462 --> 1:01:15.713
It was a dream.

1:01:16.506 --> 1:01:18.883
And just as Daenys foresaw
the end of Valyria,

1:01:18.883 --> 1:01:22.220
Aegon foresaw the end of the world of men.

1:01:22.220 --> 1:01:25.306
'Tis to begin with a terrible winter

1:01:25.390 --> 1:01:27.642
gusting out of the distant north.

1:01:27.642 --> 1:01:29.602
I, Rickon Stark,

1:01:29.602 --> 1:01:30.937
Lord of Winterfell--

1:01:30.937 --> 1:01:34.440
<i>Aegon saw absolute darkness
riding on those winds.</i>

1:01:34.524 --> 1:01:38.694
<i>And whatever dwells within
will destroy the world of the living.</i>

1:01:38.778 --> 1:01:40.738
<i>When this Great Winter comes, Rhaenyra,</i>

1:01:42.073 --> 1:01:44.700
all of Westeros must stand against it.

1:01:44.784 --> 1:01:46.244
And if the world of men is to survive,

1:01:46.244 --> 1:01:49.288
a Targaryen must be seated
on the Iron Throne.

1:01:49.372 --> 1:01:52.417
<i>A king or queen,
strong enough to unite the realm</i>

1:01:52.417 --> 1:01:55.044
<i>against the cold and the dark.</i>

1:01:57.338 --> 1:02:00.091
Aegon called his dream
"The Song of Ice and Fire."

1:02:03.094 --> 1:02:04.220
This secret,

1:02:05.346 --> 1:02:08.224
it's been passed from king to heir
since Aegon's time.

1:02:09.809 --> 1:02:12.603
Now you must promise to carry it

1:02:12.687 --> 1:02:13.729
and protect it.

1:02:17.150 --> 1:02:19.193
Promise me this, Rhaenyra.

1:02:23.406 --> 1:02:24.449
Promise me.

1:02:30.663 --> 1:02:35.751
I, Viserys Targaryen, first of his name,

1:02:37.462 --> 1:02:39.839
<i>King of the Andals, and the Rhoynar,</i>

1:02:39.839 --> 1:02:42.091
<i>and the First Men,</i>

1:02:42.175 --> 1:02:44.427
<i>Lord of the Seven Kingdoms,</i>

1:02:44.427 --> 1:02:47.221
<i>and Protector of the Realm,</i>

1:02:47.305 --> 1:02:48.806
<i>do hereby name</i>

1:02:49.557 --> 1:02:51.601
Rhaenyra Targaryen,

1:02:51.601 --> 1:02:53.936
Princess of Dragonstone

1:02:54.020 --> 1:02:56.230
and heir to the Iron Throne.
