00:05.905 --> 00:08.499
Gentlemen, behold!

00:08.875 --> 00:12.402
I have grafted a deer antler to my groin.

00:13.546 --> 00:14.638
Wow!

00:14.714 --> 00:17.615
You know, so I'll fit in
with the rest of the herd.

00:17.684 --> 00:19.652
How do you go to the bathroom?

01:23.149 --> 01:26.380
- Meatwad!
- I know. Get higher. Raise the roof.

01:26.453 --> 01:29.980
- Meatwad, you need to shut it off.
- I'm sorry.

01:30.824 --> 01:34.157
There, is that better? Can you
still hear the song with the light off?

01:34.227 --> 01:36.661
- I mean that!
- Oh, the boom box.

01:37.197 --> 01:40.655
No, we ain't doing that.
Look here, I can't sleep.

01:40.733 --> 01:43.031
I keep thinking about
all those starving children.

01:43.103 --> 01:45.628
You think about them
'cause you keep playing that song!

01:45.705 --> 01:49.072
Believe me, I know.
It's a vicious cycle. I need therapy.

01:49.142 --> 01:52.236
I think what you need is to shut up,
or it's gonna be hell week...

01:52.312 --> 01:54.405
all rolled up into one night all up in here!

01:54.481 --> 01:57.848
- Shake, I got this, okay?
- I'm serious. He'll die tonight, yo.

01:57.917 --> 02:00.613
- Shake, I told you I got this.
- You're part of it!

02:02.222 --> 02:03.655
That voice sounds real familiar.

02:03.723 --> 02:08.318
No. This here's a new artist. Sir Loin.
Listen to him. He'll change your life.

02:10.997 --> 02:13.864
That there is a song with a message,
and that message is...

02:13.933 --> 02:17.528
you need to think of the starving people
who got to eat sand to survive.

02:17.604 --> 02:21.267
Sand ain't got no nutrients.
I know, 'cause I eat it constantly.

02:21.341 --> 02:25.277
I got zero energy, I cough all the time,
my diet's bad, and...

02:27.514 --> 02:29.277
Good night, Meatwad.

02:29.749 --> 02:31.307
You can come on out now, Shake.

02:35.088 --> 02:37.318
Here it is. I was looking...

02:37.724 --> 02:40.284
Now I can go
cut that tree down in the back.

02:42.362 --> 02:43.989
Breakfast time!

02:44.063 --> 02:47.191
I made your favorite.
Sand cakes. You like those.

02:47.267 --> 02:49.633
I thought we agreed
to steer him back to real food.

02:49.702 --> 02:51.761
I know, but it's so funny
to watch him eat it.

02:51.838 --> 02:55.330
- Yeah. This is good.
- Wow, you got a bottle cap!

02:57.076 --> 02:59.169
- He's still doing it.
- Wait a sec.

02:59.245 --> 03:02.578
If the Shorteez can't have food,
then I ain't gonna have food...

03:02.649 --> 03:06.517
you know what I'm saying?
I do this for the Shorteez, y'all.

03:06.586 --> 03:08.918
Take it to church,
dump it in the collection plate.

03:08.988 --> 03:11.252
You're the rudest person I know.

03:11.324 --> 03:13.849
And that's why
you don't live here anymore.

03:13.927 --> 03:16.157
- Hey, my steak and eggs!
- Steak and eggs?

03:16.229 --> 03:18.459
- This is for the Shorteez.
- All I got is oatmeal!

03:18.531 --> 03:20.897
We're on a budget.
What do you want me to do?

03:20.967 --> 03:23.026
- Thank you very much.
- I was going to eat that!

03:23.102 --> 03:25.935
Gee whiz, I'm so sorry
to inconvenience you...

03:26.005 --> 03:28.838
while other people in the world
don't got nothing to eat.

03:28.908 --> 03:31.138
Great. Thanks for sanding up my eggs.

03:31.211 --> 03:33.941
You know what? Just take them
when you leave the country.

03:34.013 --> 03:35.844
I banish you forevermore!

03:35.915 --> 03:39.248
Are you sure that this Sir Loin
will take food that isn't prepackaged?

03:39.319 --> 03:41.344
He says he'd rather have it that way.
He says:

03:45.925 --> 03:47.449
Okay, Meatwad.

03:49.195 --> 03:53.222
Okay. I heard all that last night.
Just enjoy the hunger drive, all right?

03:54.667 --> 03:57.067
- Hey, Carl.
- Great. You've seen me.

03:57.136 --> 03:59.764
Do you want to contribute
to Sir Loin's hunger drive?

03:59.872 --> 04:02.340
- He's gonna feed the Shorteez.
- Let me see here.

04:02.408 --> 04:05.002
I think I got some oysters over here.

04:07.981 --> 04:09.107
Thank you.

04:09.182 --> 04:12.083
And be sure to thank Sir Loin
for keeping me up all night.

04:12.151 --> 04:15.416
Yeah, I'll do that.
I thought that oysters had shells.

04:15.488 --> 04:18.514
No, usually, but not these.
They were farm raised...

04:18.690 --> 04:20.886
in my throat with cheese.

04:20.959 --> 04:23.451
You want some crabs?
'Cause I got some of them.

04:23.529 --> 04:26.259
No, my bag's pretty full right now.

04:26.332 --> 04:30.063
I don't know if they're Alaskan king,
but they feel huge.

04:30.637 --> 04:35.370
Can someone please explain to me
what happened to my duckling à I'orange?

04:35.441 --> 04:38.342
- We had duckling à I'orange?
- You don't know to say it, so stop.

04:38.411 --> 04:41.642
Try it once. No, forget it.
You know what? You'll try it and then...

04:41.714 --> 04:44.581
you'll screw the name up
and then it's gonna sound disgusting.

04:44.651 --> 04:48.678
I won't even want to eat it anymore.
Thanks. Thanks for ruining my lunch...

04:48.755 --> 04:50.313
which is gone, by the way.

04:50.390 --> 04:54.292
- Have you looked in the fridge?
- Brainstorm! Alert the Internet!

04:54.360 --> 04:58.319
I got a genius on my hands.
Wait a minute, it's already open...

04:58.398 --> 05:02.300
'cause that's where I put it
when it was shipped in from Alsace.

05:02.368 --> 05:06.998
Try looking deep within your heart and
ask it where it wanted that duck to go.

05:07.073 --> 05:11.237
Down your throat, you bug-eyed freak!
You know how much that duck cost?

05:11.311 --> 05:12.744
Higher than you can count!

05:12.812 --> 05:14.643
I'm sorry to say this, but Shake's right.

05:14.714 --> 05:17.410
Charity is one thing,
but this is getting way out of hand.

05:17.483 --> 05:19.144
We don't have anything to eat now.

05:19.218 --> 05:22.551
- I don't know about that...
- Don't say sand.

05:22.622 --> 05:26.422
Come on, now. It ain't that bad.
You just got to sort of ketchup it up.

05:26.492 --> 05:31.122
- What do you got in that bag there?
- Let's see. A dead raccoon, dog doo...

05:31.497 --> 05:33.624
and more dog doo-doo.

05:33.700 --> 05:37.227
I doubt seriously that Sir Loin
wants you to send in dog doo-doo.

05:37.303 --> 05:38.395
The song goes:

05:51.584 --> 05:54.109
Exactly where does he want you
to bring all this stuff?

05:57.857 --> 06:01.349
Maybe I should go down there
with you, Meatwad. You, too, Shake.

06:03.796 --> 06:05.525
It's got a texture to it.

06:06.366 --> 06:10.598
Sort of like grits, except...
Who am I kidding? This sucks.

06:12.538 --> 06:15.837
Man, it stinks in here.
Oh, my God, look at this.

06:16.676 --> 06:19.509
This is grossing me out. I'm gonna...

06:20.246 --> 06:23.044
Those are my steak and eggs.
Get the hell out of my way!

06:23.116 --> 06:25.744
Who that? Who are these people, man?

06:25.818 --> 06:29.720
- What's going on here?
- Yo, what up, G? It's Mizzie-wazzuh.

06:29.789 --> 06:32.155
Is you the little joker
that's been bringing me sand?

06:32.225 --> 06:33.522
- Yep.
- Man, what you thinking?

06:33.593 --> 06:36.585
Are you the sandman or something?
Come on, get it together, boy!

06:36.662 --> 06:40.257
- But it's for the Shorteez, you know?
- It's for the EPA, is who it's for.

06:40.333 --> 06:41.630
What? Who said that?

06:41.701 --> 06:44.761
You ain't supposed to bring people
over here unless they dead.

06:44.837 --> 06:47.704
- Is he dead? I don't think so.
- Just as I thought.

06:47.774 --> 06:50.299
What? You don't thought nothing.
Not where I'm looking.

06:50.376 --> 06:54.005
Here I am. This is the real me, man.
Check it out. See me dancing?

06:54.080 --> 06:57.447
Yeah, you see him dancing, don't you?
MC Pee Pants!

06:57.850 --> 06:58.839
Not quite.

06:58.918 --> 07:02.684
Man, I got that done at Kazeeko's!
That's foam core. That's expensive, man!

07:02.755 --> 07:05.952
- Come out here so we can see you.
- It's all down on the farm, baby.

07:06.025 --> 07:08.220
Check me out, man.
I got a couple udders now.

07:08.294 --> 07:11.354
- Oh, man, look at you!
- What the hell happened to you?

07:11.431 --> 07:14.400
You tell me. One minute
I'm going in for a job interview...

07:14.467 --> 07:16.560
the next minute, boom! I'm in hell.

07:16.636 --> 07:19.002
Devil sent me back here
in this lower life form.

07:19.071 --> 07:21.562
- Said I got to earn my way up the ladder.
- What ladder?

07:21.641 --> 07:24.337
The hell ladder, you potato, cracker...

07:24.444 --> 07:27.572
Which ladder you think, man?
I live in hell. That's where I live.

07:27.647 --> 07:30.707
Okay. All right, settle down.
It's all cools...

07:31.484 --> 07:35.352
Okay, Frylock, let me talk to him, okay?
I know rap.

07:35.421 --> 07:37.514
Ask him what he's doing
with all this garbage.

07:37.590 --> 07:41.026
Wazzuh, wazzuh in the hizzie?

07:41.093 --> 07:43.994
Man, isn't it obvious, man? Can't you tell?

07:44.530 --> 07:47.021
- Tell him no.
- Shee...

07:47.099 --> 07:52.036
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
I was speaking to a fool.

07:52.338 --> 07:55.307
All right. Let me break it down for you.
I'll go slow.

07:55.374 --> 07:59.105
A fly is a little tiny insect. It got wings.

07:59.512 --> 08:01.446
- It flies around.
- All right.

08:01.514 --> 08:04.210
- It goes...
- All right. I know what a fly is, okay?

08:04.283 --> 08:08.652
I just want to be sure. So these flies,
they come here to eat this.

08:08.721 --> 08:11.554
The more of this I have,
the more of them I get.

08:11.624 --> 08:13.990
But they don't eat
like you and me, man. No.

08:14.060 --> 08:16.426
See, I got four stomachs.
How many you got?

08:16.496 --> 08:19.624
- I don't. Why don't you get to the point?
- I'm getting to the point!

08:19.699 --> 08:21.724
You in my house now! Yeah.

08:23.236 --> 08:24.794
- So where were we?
- The flies.

08:24.871 --> 08:28.398
I know. All right.
They spit on their food, right?

08:28.474 --> 08:31.204
They do that to eat.
And guess what they're spitting out.

08:31.277 --> 08:35.111
Acid. I'm thinking millions of flies
all spitting at once.

08:35.548 --> 08:38.312
Yeah, see what I'm thinking? Right?

08:38.384 --> 08:41.784
- I don't, but I'm sure it'll get you arrested.
- Not this time, my man!

08:41.854 --> 08:45.119
Don't you see, Frylock?
He's gonna use all that fly spit...

08:45.191 --> 08:47.591
to melt down the walls
of the First National Bank.

08:47.660 --> 08:49.890
- Exactly.
- He's angry at banks.

08:51.097 --> 08:52.257
Hate the bank...

08:52.331 --> 08:55.960
Stupid-ass meatball mother,
I melt the walls so I can get the money.

08:56.035 --> 08:59.368
So I can keep up with the payments
on this here patio furniture...

08:59.438 --> 09:03.169
which, by the way, is broken now,
'cause I broke it. Thank you very much.

09:03.242 --> 09:05.767
You ever see a cow
sit on a patio furniture? I ain't.

09:05.845 --> 09:08.177
Look at that umbrella, man. I ate half of it.

09:08.247 --> 09:10.442
Then your whole album was a lie.

09:10.516 --> 09:13.576
It wasn't for the Shorteez at all.
It was for you.

09:13.653 --> 09:16.417
If I don't come through with this,
they'll take everything.

09:16.489 --> 09:19.720
I know I shouldn't have rented furniture.
But I got expensive taste.

09:19.792 --> 09:22.352
- You don't even have a patio, man.
- I know that now.

09:22.895 --> 09:25.455
I think the lesson here is:
Never rent furniture.

09:25.531 --> 09:28.056
The interest is too high,
the terms are unreasonable...

09:28.134 --> 09:30.034
for something that you really didn't need.

09:30.102 --> 09:32.730
Bitch, I need to sit! The farmer gets to sit.

09:32.805 --> 09:34.636
Saying, "Give me the milk".

09:34.707 --> 09:37.141
I'm gonna take that stool away
from that farmer.

09:37.209 --> 09:40.303
Stick it right up his ass.
Tired of that farmer.

09:40.780 --> 09:43.078
There isn't a farmer, is there?

09:43.616 --> 09:48.485
I can't fill the hole in my life with stuff.
My heart's playing tricks on me, man!

09:48.554 --> 09:50.249
Look, we're gonna fix all that, okay?

09:50.323 --> 09:52.791
You go in there
and get yourself a low-interest loan...

09:52.858 --> 09:55.759
with reasonable terms,
so you can get that debt under control.

09:56.929 --> 09:58.521
- That says "bank"?
- Yes, it does.

09:58.598 --> 10:01.089
- You know I got trouble with words, man.
- Yeah.

10:01.167 --> 10:04.694
When it comes to rapping, I got it,
but when it's books and science...

10:04.770 --> 10:06.465
and closed captioning, I'm at a loss.

10:06.539 --> 10:08.063
Now go on up the loan chute.

10:08.140 --> 10:11.974
After I get this, I'm gonna get my GED
and turn my life around.

10:12.044 --> 10:13.477
Okay. See you later.

10:13.546 --> 10:15.241
- Hey, man.
- That's good. Let's go.

10:15.314 --> 10:17.942
Wait a minute, man,
this ain't no bank! Oh, God!

10:18.985 --> 10:22.148
I feel like a fool.
I ain't never again gonna do...

10:22.221 --> 10:25.520
what no stupid rap musician
gonna tell me what to do.

10:25.591 --> 10:26.853
That's a good idea, Meatwad.

10:26.926 --> 10:29.622
From now on,
it's only heavy metal bands...

10:29.695 --> 10:32.721
that are gonna boss me around.
Them people speak the truth.

10:32.798 --> 10:35.164
They got this six-story skeleton
named Eddie...

10:35.234 --> 10:38.635
and he, like, opens his mouth
all crazy fang-like.

10:38.938 --> 10:40.132
He's crazy as hell.

10:40.206 --> 10:42.674
And that's why
you've got the eye makeup on, right?

10:43.209 --> 10:46.736
This here is my demon face.
You see, I'm Satan's onion.

10:47.413 --> 10:49.040
- Scallion.
- Minion?

10:49.115 --> 10:50.480
No, not that.

10:50.549 --> 10:53.518
- Why the CB radio?
- For contacting the devil.

10:53.686 --> 10:58.214
Satan, you got your ears on?
Come on, under. Over. Roger.

10:58.290 --> 10:59.382
<i>10-4, good buddy.</i>

10:59.458 --> 11:01.824
You got Beelzebub on the down low.
Come back.

11:01.894 --> 11:04.920
- Hey, Satan, my man! What's up, man?
- Shut up!

11:05.464 --> 11:07.022
I'm on the phone here.
