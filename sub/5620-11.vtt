00:00.959 --> 00:03.959
So, Friday night,
I'm with this smokin' hot chick.

00:04.041 --> 00:05.542
Her boyfriend was
on the elevator, too.

00:05.625 --> 00:07.333
He was even better looking.

00:07.417 --> 00:10.375
They're making out so hard
they don't even notice

00:10.458 --> 00:11.375
what comes out
of her purse.

00:11.458 --> 00:13.542
Bam! Susan B. Anthony.

00:13.625 --> 00:15.417
<i>What?</i>
Okay, what?
Another coin story?

00:15.500 --> 00:17.375
Morning, gang.

00:17.458 --> 00:18.667
Jimmy, thank God.

00:18.750 --> 00:19.875
Tell me about
your night.

00:19.959 --> 00:21.458
Oh! Uh...

00:21.542 --> 00:22.792

like this.

00:22.875 --> 00:24.333

Last night, I'm in
the produce department

00:25.959 --> 00:27.875
at the grocery store and
I'm minding my own business.

00:27.959 --> 00:29.250
And, uh, I'm
not gonna lie,

00:29.333 --> 00:30.667
I'm looking pretty
good, right?
Mm-hmm.

00:30.750 --> 00:32.375
Then I heard this girl
call my name.

00:32.458 --> 00:33.542
"Bimmy!"

00:33.625 --> 00:35.417
Right?
"Bimmy!"

00:35.500 --> 00:37.875
Turns out to be my
granddaughter Edie.

00:37.959 --> 00:39.583
She calls me
"Bimmy" now.

00:39.667 --> 00:41.208
And you think that's crazy?

00:41.291 --> 00:43.250
I looked down on their cart...
we have the same stuff.

00:43.333 --> 00:44.667
Like baby stuff

00:44.750 --> 00:46.291
and snacks for
when she comes over,

00:46.375 --> 00:47.792
and it's like, we got to start
coordinating this!

00:49.000 --> 00:51.458
Anyway...

00:51.542 --> 00:52.500
Uh...

00:52.583 --> 00:53.834
And then--

00:53.917 --> 00:55.166
this is the
best part--

00:55.250 --> 00:57.083
I'm, I go up to the,
um, the checkout area

00:57.166 --> 00:58.709
and who's there?

00:58.792 --> 01:00.875
Pam Anderson, Carmen Electra
and Jenny McCarthy.

01:00.959 --> 01:01.917
And they're like,

01:02.000 --> 01:03.291

to see your first movie

01:45.834 --> 01:46.959

long-term attention problems.

01:52.166 --> 01:55.208
Like the ones Mommy has.

All right,
tonight's feature presentation

01:57.375 --> 01:59.917
is<i> The Little Mermaid! </i>

the cup holder sitch?

02:12.625 --> 02:14.834
'Cause I'm not holding
my own cup.

02:14.917 --> 02:16.291
I have 13 cup holders.

02:29.625 --> 02:30.917
Wasn't planning on it.

I used to be Jimmy Martino,
man about town.

Now I'm this boring guy
who hangs out in the suburbs

02:35.583 --> 02:37.125
on the weekends with his family.
I'm-I'm...

02:37.208 --> 02:39.625
Bimmy!

02:39.709 --> 02:41.709
Now, tonight
I'm gonna get my groove back.

02:41.792 --> 02:43.709
I'm putting the old gang
back together.

02:43.792 --> 02:46.750
That's right--
the Sat Pack.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.041
What's the Sat Pack?

02:48.125 --> 02:49.333
Please don't ask.

02:49.417 --> 02:51.041
You're an adult. Ask.
Finish your question.

02:51.125 --> 02:53.500
Mom, I'm sorry, I have to know.
What's the Sat Pack?

02:53.583 --> 02:55.125
(groans)

02:55.208 --> 02:57.667
And when you get us knuckleheads
together... (sputters)

02:57.750 --> 02:59.458
watch out, anything can happen.

02:59.542 --> 03:01.667
Uh, fistfights, threesomes.
We once took a trip

03:01.750 --> 03:03.125
to Mount Rushmore--
I never see

03:03.208 --> 03:05.834
these guys anymore, because
I'm stuck with you people.

03:07.125 --> 03:09.250
We call ourselves the Sat Pack,
and do not,

03:09.333 --> 03:12.041
I repeat, do not ask why.

03:12.125 --> 03:13.208
Why do you call...

03:13.291 --> 03:15.792
what he's doing, right?
Don't take the bait.

03:15.875 --> 03:16.875
It's all I want to know.

03:16.959 --> 03:18.959
It's a long story, son,
but, you see...

03:19.041 --> 03:20.250
It's because they
hang out on Saturdays--

03:20.333 --> 03:23.000
that's literally it.
Cool.

03:23.083 --> 03:24.166
Yeah, I came up with the idea.

03:24.250 --> 03:26.041
It's a satire on the Rat Pack.

03:26.125 --> 03:27.750
Well, anyway, the point is,

03:27.834 --> 03:29.250
I'm not hanging out
with you guys tonight, okay?

03:29.333 --> 03:30.709
Tonight I'm dead to you.
You got it?

03:30.792 --> 03:32.375
That's fine,
because we have plans tonight

03:32.458 --> 03:34.083
that have nothing
to do with you.

03:34.166 --> 03:36.000
Bruce found this
great Chinese restaurant...

03:36.083 --> 03:37.625
We get it-- Bruce used
to live in China.

03:37.709 --> 03:39.417
Look, I go to Cabo
once a year--

03:39.500 --> 03:41.417

down everyone's throat.

03:41.500 --> 03:42.917

Oh. (chuckles)

03:46.166 --> 03:48.208
You're going on a double
date with your son?

03:48.291 --> 03:50.166
Man, if Ronnie from
the Sat Pack were here,

03:57.959 --> 03:59.667
just to brag about
your plans tonight?

03:59.750 --> 04:03.083
You could've called.

what I would do.

04:14.500 --> 04:17.125
Suck up to celebrities
and hit on women? Got it.

04:17.208 --> 04:19.542
Jimmy, Jimmy, I can absolutely
hold down the fort tonight,

04:19.625 --> 04:21.125

07:51.417 --> 07:52.917
Sat Pack!

07:53.000 --> 07:55.417
Greatest group of morons
you'll ever want to meet.

07:55.500 --> 07:57.875
All right, everybody, this is
Marco, he's a plastic surgeon.

07:57.959 --> 08:00.333
Does all the big-time breast
reductions in Hollywood.

08:00.417 --> 08:02.959
And this of course is Stevie.

08:03.041 --> 08:04.333
Stevie, uh produces
the reality show

08:04.417 --> 08:05.875
about the racist family
who runs a business.

08:05.959 --> 08:09.333
And this is my best friend
since I'm 20 years old,

08:09.417 --> 08:10.333
Ronnie.

08:10.417 --> 08:12.125
Ah, Ronnie.
Ah... Jimmy.

08:12.208 --> 08:13.417
Ronnie bought and sold

08:13.500 --> 08:14.875
the biggest solar company
in California.

08:14.959 --> 08:16.333
Don't worry, ladies,
I don't really care

08:16.417 --> 08:17.333
about the environment.

08:17.417 --> 08:19.291
(laughing)

08:19.375 --> 08:21.291
Last but not least.

08:21.375 --> 08:22.542
Ladies, they call me Ravi.

08:22.625 --> 08:24.166
I'm in charge
of all things kitchen.

08:24.250 --> 08:25.917
Here's a little rap
to remember my name.

08:26.000 --> 08:27.917
(rapping): Yo, my name is Rav,
I fit like a glove...

08:28.000 --> 08:29.375
Is someone's elbow
on the button, guys?

08:29.458 --> 08:31.875
Alicia, I think, uh, you
and Ronnie might hit it off.

08:31.959 --> 08:34.375
You know, he's
recently single.

08:34.458 --> 08:37.083
Yes, actually, my wife just
left me for another man.

08:37.166 --> 08:39.166
Older and richer or
younger and poorer?

08:39.250 --> 08:41.500
Older and much poorer.

08:41.583 --> 08:43.750
ALL: Ooh.

08:43.834 --> 08:45.375
It's about making
new ones, right?

08:45.458 --> 08:47.166
Like getting that stain
out of your shirt right there.

08:47.250 --> 08:48.208
What?

08:48.291 --> 08:49.208
Ronnie!

08:49.291 --> 08:50.375
(laughing)

08:50.458 --> 08:52.000
(bantering indistinctly)

08:52.083 --> 08:55.000
They don't make men
like this anymore.

08:55.083 --> 08:56.458
Coolest of the cool.

08:56.542 --> 08:58.583
JIMMY:
I'm coming in for the nipple.

08:58.667 --> 09:00.917
(no audio)

09:01.834 --> 09:04.250
(sighs)
Wow, that's rough.

09:04.333 --> 09:06.625
He really thought she was
gonna move to China for him.

09:06.709 --> 09:08.834
Talk about being on
different pages.

09:08.917 --> 09:11.917
Yeah. L-Let's never
be like that, okay?

09:12.000 --> 09:14.083
You know, l-let's make sure
we're always on the same page?

09:14.166 --> 09:15.625
Starting now.

09:15.709 --> 09:17.709
Do we really need
to worry about that right now?

09:17.792 --> 09:19.208
I mean, we're not
even exclusive.

09:19.291 --> 09:20.709
We're not?
(short laugh)

09:20.792 --> 09:23.125
Really? You're dating
other guys?

09:24.750 --> 09:26.583
I'm sorry, Not to put you
on the spot.

09:26.667 --> 09:28.000
No, no, no,
I'm just trying to count

09:28.083 --> 09:29.417
how many other guys
I'm dating.

09:29.500 --> 09:30.583
Now, this is gonna
seem high

09:30.667 --> 09:32.583
because I was just in Aruba.

09:32.667 --> 09:34.291
All right,
let's just back it up.

09:34.375 --> 09:36.291
Uh, here's what I know.

09:36.375 --> 09:37.875
I know we haven't been
dating very long,

09:37.959 --> 09:40.250
but I-I really like you.
And I-I think

09:40.333 --> 09:42.250
maybe we should be exclusive.

09:42.333 --> 09:43.625
Now you go.

09:43.709 --> 09:45.458
You're a really great guy.

09:45.542 --> 09:46.834
And-and we've had a lot of fun.

09:46.917 --> 09:48.291
Ooh, I like where this is going.

09:48.375 --> 09:49.458
But we're obviously

09:49.542 --> 09:50.500
in very different places.

09:50.583 --> 09:51.625
You want
to move fast,

09:51.709 --> 09:53.166
maybe because
you have a child.

09:53.250 --> 09:55.250
Not sure we're looking for
the same thing.

09:56.250 --> 09:58.000
I think we should break up.

09:59.166 --> 10:00.458
(short laugh)
Wow.

10:00.542 --> 10:02.542
It<i> was </i>good to have
this conversation.

10:02.625 --> 10:05.166
That way we could end things
before either of us got hurt.

10:05.250 --> 10:08.083
Ooh, are these shrimp?

10:08.166 --> 10:09.959
Mmm.

10:10.041 --> 10:11.959
(chuckling)
Make yourselves at home.

10:12.041 --> 10:14.625
(all chattering)

10:14.709 --> 10:17.709
(upbeat music starts playing)

10:17.792 --> 10:19.458
What?

10:19.542 --> 10:21.458
Ronnie.

10:21.542 --> 10:22.917
Bring it in.

10:23.000 --> 10:25.375
Jimmy.

10:25.458 --> 10:27.208
I freaking love you.

10:27.291 --> 10:28.500
It's gonna get
crazy tonight.

10:28.583 --> 10:29.959
It's gonna get the craziest.

10:30.041 --> 10:31.500
You gonna pull away?
'Cause I'm not.

10:31.583 --> 10:33.417
I'm not pulling away.

10:33.500 --> 10:36.166
All right, we both pull
away on three. Ready?

10:36.250 --> 10:38.166
BOTH:
One, two, three.

10:38.250 --> 10:39.792
Aah! (laugh)
I didn't pull away.

10:39.875 --> 10:41.125
I didn't do it.

10:41.208 --> 10:42.750
Never.

10:42.834 --> 10:44.709
Dad, thank God you're here.
I need to talk to you.

10:44.792 --> 10:46.750
Play Tender Folk Mix.

10:46.834 --> 10:49.083
(music switches to folk)
♪ Every now and again... ♪

10:52.291 --> 10:54.667
Hey. What are you doing here?
I thought I was supposed to
be dead to you tonight.

10:54.750 --> 10:56.375
Okay, I'm sorry,
I didn't know you had plans.

10:56.458 --> 10:58.291
I drove all the way to
Pasadena to tell you.

10:58.375 --> 10:59.500
But I thought
that was to borrow a spoon.

10:59.583 --> 11:01.250
(sighs) Gerald...

11:01.333 --> 11:03.000
I have the Sat Pack here.

11:03.083 --> 11:05.375
Well, now you got the Sad Pack
here, too. Party of me.

11:05.458 --> 11:07.000
I get it. Clever. Eh...

11:07.083 --> 11:08.625
Let's move on.
What-what's up tonight?

11:08.709 --> 11:09.709
Frankie and I broke up.

11:09.792 --> 11:11.542
Oh, I'm sorry, son.

11:11.625 --> 11:14.250
Thanks. Hey, what's
the ice cream situation here?

11:14.333 --> 11:15.500
Ah, maybe
it'll make me feel better

11:15.583 --> 11:16.583
just to tell you
how I'm feeling:

11:16.667 --> 11:17.875
awful.

11:17.959 --> 11:19.500
No, that did nothing.

11:19.583 --> 11:21.333
God, I just want to curl up
with a root beer float,

11:21.417 --> 11:22.667
depending on
the ice cream situation.

11:22.750 --> 11:24.709
Mm.

11:24.792 --> 11:26.542
I'm sorry,
I-I should let you go.

11:26.625 --> 11:29.542
Okay.

11:29.625 --> 11:32.083
(sighs)
All right, you can stay.

11:32.166 --> 11:33.250
But don't unload your
feelings on everyone.

11:33.333 --> 11:34.500
It's not good for you

11:34.583 --> 11:35.542
and it's not good
for the party.

11:35.625 --> 11:37.542
You need a good Sat Pack night.

11:37.625 --> 11:39.125
This'll be good for you--
to cut loose a little bit,

11:39.208 --> 11:40.542
have some fun,
break some hearts, right?

11:40.625 --> 11:42.375
Okay.

11:42.458 --> 11:44.208
Fresh meat.

11:44.291 --> 11:46.542
Go unclog the shower, pledge.

11:46.625 --> 11:49.583
Just kidding.
Happy to have you.

11:49.667 --> 11:51.417
So then the goat
looks back at me

11:51.500 --> 11:54.583
and says,
"You're being baad."

11:54.667 --> 11:56.834
What's going on?

11:56.917 --> 11:59.583
(laughs)
Hilarious. Can I hear it?

11:59.667 --> 12:01.375
You want me to tell
the whole story again?

12:01.458 --> 12:03.333
There's only so many times
I can hump your couch.

12:03.417 --> 12:04.625
Shots?

12:04.709 --> 12:06.625
None for me, thanks.

12:06.709 --> 12:10.208
I feel like I've already
taken a shot. To the gut.

12:10.291 --> 12:12.208
That's my son Gerald, everybody.
That's Gerald.

12:12.291 --> 12:14.625
He, uh, he's having sort of
a rough night, but he promised

12:14.709 --> 12:16.583
he wouldn't
kill the vibe, right?

12:16.667 --> 12:19.041
Oh, no, what happened?

12:19.125 --> 12:22.583
It's okay. I've been sort of
"forbidden" to talk about it.

12:22.667 --> 12:24.000
Oh...

12:24.083 --> 12:25.041
You can tell us.

12:25.125 --> 12:26.625
Where do I begin?

12:26.709 --> 12:28.000
(sighs)

12:28.083 --> 12:29.333
It's just never been a challenge

12:29.417 --> 12:31.333
for me to be vulnerable,
you know?

12:33.750 --> 12:36.625
When I was 17,
I was 290 pounds.

12:36.709 --> 12:39.125
Spoiler alert:
it wasn't all muscle.

12:41.500 --> 12:42.917
Mmm.

12:43.000 --> 12:45.083
So...

12:45.166 --> 12:47.458
I guess we'll do the
long-distance thing, you know?

12:47.542 --> 12:50.458
We'll... meet up,
like, once a year

12:50.542 --> 12:53.750
and talk on the phone sometimes.

12:53.834 --> 12:56.083
You know, it's only a 15-hour
time difference, right?

12:56.166 --> 12:58.083
So, 8:00 p.m. for me is, like...

12:58.166 --> 12:59.750
5:00 a.m. for me.

12:59.834 --> 13:03.166
I'm in a great mood then.

13:05.792 --> 13:07.959
So I only ate
the veggie dumplings,

13:08.041 --> 13:11.166
so how are we gonna do the bill?

13:11.250 --> 13:13.792
I just wish I could erase
this awful feeling, you know?

13:13.875 --> 13:15.625
Guess it'll just take time.

13:15.709 --> 13:18.542
I think the problem is that
I open myself up too easily.

13:18.625 --> 13:19.917
Gerald, that's not
a problem.

13:20.000 --> 13:21.959
Everyone else
is the problem.

13:22.041 --> 13:23.583
Yeah, you know what, uh,

13:23.667 --> 13:26.667
I'm exactly like Gerald.
I love to love.

13:26.750 --> 13:28.917
I got a heart the size
of a freakin' cheese wheel.

13:29.000 --> 13:30.542
Can you move?
You're sitting on my purse.

13:30.625 --> 13:32.333
Kind of like it?

13:32.417 --> 13:34.417
Okay, excuse me.

13:34.500 --> 13:36.291
<i>Hey, Jimmy,</i>

13:36.375 --> 13:38.542
you know what the best part
of having your son here is?

13:38.625 --> 13:40.875
What?

13:40.959 --> 13:42.667
Don't worry.
The key to unlock this night

13:42.750 --> 13:43.959
is coming through this door

13:44.041 --> 13:46.750
in three, two, one.

13:46.834 --> 13:48.500
I can't believe you made me
wait out there for ten minutes

13:48.583 --> 13:50.000
just so you could be dramatic.

13:50.083 --> 13:51.667
I'm a showman.
All right, what do you got?

13:51.750 --> 13:53.041
I made some calls,
got us into a yacht party

13:53.125 --> 13:54.834
hosted by the Winklevoss twins.

13:54.917 --> 13:56.667
A yacht party--
I like that.

13:56.750 --> 13:58.250
I'm gonna make this up to you.

13:58.333 --> 13:59.417
It's all good.

13:59.500 --> 14:00.625
Boob cage can make it up

14:00.709 --> 14:01.709
to me on the boat.

14:01.792 --> 14:02.709
You're going with us?

14:02.792 --> 14:03.709
Who's watching my restaurant?

14:03.792 --> 14:05.542
Ian's got it covered.

14:05.625 --> 14:06.542
Uh, everybody?

14:06.625 --> 14:07.709
The Sat Pack's going

14:07.792 --> 14:08.917
to a yacht party!

14:09.000 --> 14:10.792
(excited chattering)

14:13.500 --> 14:14.917
(groans)
These dumb remotes!

14:15.000 --> 14:16.458
Screw it.

14:16.542 --> 14:17.709
I'm killing the movie.

14:17.792 --> 14:20.208
Let's just make the cake.

14:22.917 --> 14:25.000
(rattling)

14:25.083 --> 14:27.583
Edie?

14:30.625 --> 14:32.709
All right, let's
get our story straight.

14:32.792 --> 14:34.208
I was teaching you to read

14:34.291 --> 14:36.083
when you tied me up
and did this to yourself.

14:36.166 --> 14:38.959
Okay, Mommy.

14:39.041 --> 14:41.083
♪ ♪

14:41.166 --> 14:43.125
See, Ronnie, it always
works out for us.

14:43.208 --> 14:45.625
Ten minutes we'll be on a yacht
with a couple of blond twins.

14:45.709 --> 14:46.750
Male twins but still.

14:46.834 --> 14:48.125
I call the ugly Winklevoss.

14:48.208 --> 14:49.625
(both laugh)

14:49.709 --> 14:51.208
Yeah. Plus,
once we're out at sea,

14:51.291 --> 14:53.375
none of your other
family members can get to us.

14:53.458 --> 14:54.750
(laughter)

14:54.834 --> 14:56.166
All right, I
deserve that.

14:56.250 --> 14:58.750
Mm. I'm just kidding
with you, buddy.

14:58.834 --> 15:01.750
Why don't we make like old times
and stop and donate blood

15:01.834 --> 15:04.625
on the way to the party?
See if we can drunk faster.

15:04.709 --> 15:06.750
(chuckles)

15:06.834 --> 15:08.750
(phone chimes)

15:08.834 --> 15:11.917
Huh...

15:26.917 --> 15:28.667
(whooping from inside limo)

15:28.750 --> 15:30.792

Where the hell are we?

15:38.250 --> 15:39.792
Why are we stopping here?

15:39.875 --> 15:41.959
Oh, well, you never know where a
Sat Pack night's gonna take you:

15:42.041 --> 15:45.083
yacht party, Playboy Mansion,
Sara's house.

15:46.375 --> 15:47.458
I'll be back in five.

15:51.291 --> 15:52.583
All right, you got
five minutes of my time.

15:52.667 --> 15:54.000
Make 'em count.
I got a yacht to catch.

15:54.083 --> 15:56.417
What are you doing here?
I didn't tell you to come.

15:56.500 --> 15:58.083
Well, you texted me
because you wanted me to come.

15:58.166 --> 15:59.709
Let's not do this dance.

15:59.792 --> 16:01.542
All right, what's up?

16:01.625 --> 16:03.875
Well, since you're here...

16:05.375 --> 16:07.291
I'm about to get mine.

16:07.375 --> 16:09.834
Watch and learn.

16:10.834 --> 16:13.750
Hey.

16:13.834 --> 16:15.667
So, I couldn't help
but notice

16:15.750 --> 16:17.917
that neither of us
have boyfriends here tonight.

16:18.000 --> 16:20.709
Oh, mine's in Sacramento
for a medical convention.

16:20.792 --> 16:21.959
Where's yours?

16:24.959 --> 16:26.750
Ouch.

16:26.834 --> 16:29.166
I'll take it from here.

16:31.000 --> 16:32.750
(grunts)

16:32.834 --> 16:34.875
I'm gay.

16:34.959 --> 16:36.750
Thanks for talking to me
about this, Alicia.

16:36.834 --> 16:38.750
Of course.
Do you feel any better?

16:38.834 --> 16:40.125
I'm dead inside.

16:40.208 --> 16:41.792
I'm a husk of a man.

16:41.875 --> 16:44.208
What the hell is
taking Jimmy so long?

16:44.291 --> 16:46.792
Move to China?
That's-that's a big ask.

16:46.875 --> 16:50.250
Yeah. But the old me would have
done that at the drop of a hat.

16:50.333 --> 16:54.000
My plan was always to
live all over the world.

16:54.083 --> 16:56.208
Los Angeles was just
the first stop.

16:56.291 --> 16:59.000
And then Gerald came along,

16:59.083 --> 17:01.125
and so I told myself,

17:01.208 --> 17:04.208
"I will see the world when
he moves out of the house."

17:04.291 --> 17:06.041
Mm. Good luck with that.
Have you seen what I pay him?

17:06.125 --> 17:08.792
(chuckles)
And then there was Edie.

17:08.875 --> 17:12.792
All of a sudden the idea
of moving is just ridiculous.

17:12.875 --> 17:15.000
Even if it's for Bruce.

17:15.083 --> 17:17.000
Well, you know what they say.

17:17.083 --> 17:19.792
Things happen for a reason,
right?

17:19.875 --> 17:23.083
Maybe the best guy for you
is right here in Los Angeles.

17:24.917 --> 17:27.500
You know, Ronnie's single now.

17:27.583 --> 17:29.083
(both laugh)

17:29.166 --> 17:31.083
All right, I'm starting
to feel this wine.

17:31.166 --> 17:32.709
Couple more glasses of this,

17:32.792 --> 17:35.834
I would consider making a trip
to Ronnie-ville.

17:35.917 --> 17:37.125
(knocking)

17:37.208 --> 17:38.875
What the hell
is this?

17:38.959 --> 17:41.375
Oh, hey, Ronnie!
I was just talking

17:41.458 --> 17:42.834
about how I was gonna
have sex with you,

17:42.917 --> 17:44.458
but I'm not going to.

17:44.542 --> 17:46.709
Nice to see you, too, Sara.
Jimmy, you said five minutes.

17:46.792 --> 17:47.959
It's been 20.

17:48.041 --> 17:50.083
Well, Sara needed me.
This is important.

17:50.166 --> 17:51.917
All right. I'm leaving.

17:52.000 --> 17:54.333
Why? Tonight was supposed
to be about us.

17:54.417 --> 17:56.917
And while you're sitting here,
sipping on wine, I've been out,

17:57.000 --> 17:58.750
sitting on my thumb,
in some driveway

17:58.834 --> 18:00.125
in the freaking boondocks.

18:00.208 --> 18:02.834
It's Pasadena.
And it's charming.

18:02.917 --> 18:03.834
Well, great.
Have fun.

18:03.917 --> 18:05.333
I'll just go back out there

18:05.417 --> 18:06.834
and listen
to your daughter Gerald

18:06.917 --> 18:08.583
tell me all about her problems.

18:08.667 --> 18:10.083
All right, you know what,
it's time for you to calm down,

18:10.166 --> 18:11.583
because I'm starting
to see the vein.

18:11.667 --> 18:13.625
Good!
The vein comes out for a reason.

18:13.709 --> 18:15.208
Yeah. You're the reason.

18:15.291 --> 18:16.709
the hand comes out, remember?

18:16.792 --> 18:17.875
I remember.
Remember the last time

18:17.959 --> 18:19.875
your hand came out? I did this.

18:19.959 --> 18:21.166
Ha, ha,
you like that, Grandpa?

18:21.250 --> 18:23.375
'Cause I...
(grunts)

18:23.458 --> 18:24.583
Oh!

18:24.667 --> 18:26.875
Wow. That felt good.

18:26.959 --> 18:28.542
I did need
to cut loose.

18:28.625 --> 18:30.333
I'm gonna go make out
with Alicia real quick.

18:30.417 --> 18:31.875
Wh...

18:31.959 --> 18:34.166
(Ronnie groans)

18:34.250 --> 18:36.375
You okay?

18:36.458 --> 18:38.875
Yeah. I'm fine.

18:38.959 --> 18:39.875
Just horny.

18:39.959 --> 18:41.000
You're always horny.

18:41.083 --> 18:42.875
You want my
forehead again?

18:42.959 --> 18:44.291
(chuckles)

18:44.375 --> 18:46.083
Yeah, but this time
it's different.

18:46.166 --> 18:49.458
I think I'm horny
for what you have.

18:49.542 --> 18:52.208
I'm horny for family.

18:52.291 --> 18:54.041
I know you, Ronnie.
Someday you're gonna find out

18:54.125 --> 18:57.500
you have a kid you
didn't know about, too.

18:57.583 --> 18:59.291
Hey, guys, yeah,
can we speed this up?

18:59.375 --> 19:01.041
You're kind of making us
late to the yacht party.

19:01.125 --> 19:02.500
Ian, what are you doing here?

19:02.583 --> 19:04.417
And who's running
the restaurant?

19:04.500 --> 19:06.417
Thank you for coming.

19:06.500 --> 19:08.250
the best experience
we've had at Jimmy's.

19:08.333 --> 19:10.625
Whatever you're doing,
don't change a thing.

19:10.709 --> 19:12.917
Okay.

19:13.000 --> 19:16.500
Well? To the yacht, huh?

19:16.583 --> 19:18.709
Definitely. Hell yeah.

19:18.792 --> 19:19.875
What time is it, about 1:00?

19:19.959 --> 19:21.125
It's got to be later than that.

19:21.208 --> 19:22.291
It's 10:30.

19:22.375 --> 19:24.834
Oh, great, you're here!

19:24.917 --> 19:27.125
Edie won't take a bath
unless it's with you.

19:27.208 --> 19:28.250
Bimmy.

19:32.166 --> 19:34.583
All right. Come on.
Come on, you.

19:34.667 --> 19:37.166
(grunts)

19:37.250 --> 19:40.041
(Vanessa laughs)

19:44.458 --> 19:46.083
(indistinct chatter)

19:46.166 --> 19:48.959
RONNIE:
All right, let's do this!
Yacht party!

19:49.041 --> 19:51.291
(cheering, whooping)

19:51.375 --> 19:55.583
Yes, I'd like a cab
to Valley Village, please.

19:55.667 --> 19:58.875
Unbelievable.

19:58.959 --> 19:59.750
Everything okay, Jimmy?

19:59.834 --> 20:00.750
No, it's not okay.

20:00.834 --> 20:01.959
I asked for one night off.

20:02.041 --> 20:03.750
And do I get it? No.

20:03.834 --> 20:05.583
Because I-I got to be here
for you guys.

20:05.667 --> 20:07.959
"Dad, can you help me navigate
the seas of love?"

20:08.041 --> 20:09.083
And "Jimmy, my boyfriend's
moving to China.

20:09.166 --> 20:11.000
(squeaking)

20:11.083 --> 20:12.750
Never asked him.
Couldn't get him to leave.

20:12.834 --> 20:14.917
And the worst part is
I don't have a choice.

20:15.000 --> 20:16.750
I have to be here for you now
because I care about you,

20:16.834 --> 20:19.000
and it's annoying.
I can't even enjoy violent

20:19.083 --> 20:21.417
rap songs because of her.

20:21.500 --> 20:23.291
He's saying nice things
in a mad voice.

20:23.375 --> 20:25.000
Yeah, because I<i> am </i>mad.

20:25.083 --> 20:28.542
Here. You're taking advantage
of me, and-and I am mad

20:28.625 --> 20:30.208
because it's Saturday night
and I have to spend my night

20:30.291 --> 20:32.333
in a bathtub because
I'm the only one in this family

20:32.417 --> 20:35.083
who knows
how to make bath time fun.

20:36.125 --> 20:37.709
I'm in hell.

20:38.709 --> 20:40.000
(blows)

20:40.083 --> 20:41.542
Ooh.
