Operations says we got
a black ice alert
on the bridges.

00:05.214 --> 00:08.047
Weather guys are
like psychics, man.
They don’t know squat.

00:08.134 --> 00:12.719
I went to a psychic once.
Talked to my mother.
Mom even bothered me dead.

00:12.847 --> 00:14.803
All ofthe bridges?
All of’em.

00:14.891 --> 00:18.054
Okay.
Fill me up!
[ Machine/y W/I/rr/ng ]

00:21.898 --> 00:24.480
- [loud Thua’]
- What’s up?

00:24.567 --> 00:26.728
Something in the salt.

00:28.779 --> 00:30.770
- [ Gasps]
- What is it?

00:30.865 --> 00:33.527
You know that Bib/e 5t0/y
about the woman
who turns into salt?

00:33.618 --> 00:37.452
- Lot’s wife?
- I think maybe
we found her.

00:44.086 --> 00:46.668
[Policeman ] Yes, it’s cold.
What’s your procedure when
the roads freeze up?

00:46.756 --> 00:48.963
[ Booth ]
The weather’s been warm
for the past six weeks.

00:49.050 --> 00:50.915
Wow. So they haven’t
had to use rock salt.

00:51.052 --> 00:54.510
Whoo/
The dermis is
extremely desiccated.

00:54.597 --> 00:56.633
The salt
quick-o’r/eo’ the tissues.

00:56.724 --> 01:00.216
- Looks like a really big apple doll.
- It’s a teenage girl.

01:00.311 --> 01:03.178
l/e/y ta//.
5/X feet

01:03.272 --> 01:06.105
Looks like she’s been dead
for about a hundred years.

01:06.192 --> 01:09.150
No. In fact,
less than a month.
Salt is hygroscopic.

01:09.237 --> 01:12.445
It draws moisture from
its surroundings and
replaces it with crystal.

01:21.415 --> 01:24.327
They’re independent
and self-assured,
like you.

01:24.460 --> 01:26.576

Aw.

01:26.671 --> 01:28.753

01:28.881 --> 01:32.840
Which you gonna pick?
Uh, this is a lion
eating a gazelle.

01:32.927 --> 01:35.293
What’s with the sudden
pet desire?

01:35.429 --> 01:37.340
We’re not even
living together.
Yet.

01:37.473 --> 01:42.809
Look at him, Rox.
Look at his warm, brown eyes.

This country was founded
on the notion
of religious tolerance.

02:02.707 --> 02:05.619

[Device Beeps]

02:08.045 --> 02:09.546
Thank you for your patience.

02:09.630 --> 02:12.542
I had no choice.
Apparently, it’s
a constitutional issue.

02:15.011 --> 02:19.880
Uh, trauma to the temporal
and sphenoid region with
buckling on the outer edges.

02:19.974 --> 02:22.886
Probably from being
dropped from the bin.

02:22.977 --> 02:25.969
- Bonk.

02:26.063 --> 02:28.224
- Ooh, that’s me.
- [Brennan]
Mr l/aziri

02:28.316 --> 02:30.648
do you see the antemortem
s/(eleta/ trauma?

02:30.735 --> 02:35.320
Signiﬁcant remodeling of
the metacarpopha/angea/
joint on the right thumb.

02:35.406 --> 02:38.489
A snap.
An old fracture
to the little finger.

02:38.576 --> 02:43.912
Crack. And a bone chip
at the dorsal radial portion
ofthe left wrist.

02:43.998 --> 02:47.582
-Pop?
- I’ve seen this before
in cases ofabuse.

02:47.668 --> 02:51.252
A girl who was handcuffed
to a radiator in order
to preserve her virginity.

02:51.339 --> 02:54.297
Well, it turns out
there aren ’t that many
7 6 -year-o/d girls...

02:54.383 --> 02:57.045
who are six feet tall
on the missing persons list.

02:57.136 --> 03:01.425
Ashley Clark
Missing three weeks.

03:03.392 --> 03:07.431
So Roxie and / are getting a dog.

03:07.521 --> 03:10.729
Wo w. / had Roxie
pegged as a cat person.

03:10.816 --> 03:13.273
He y. /’m Angela.

03:13.361 --> 03:15.602
Oh. Arastoo Vaziri.

03:15.696 --> 03:18.779
Um, your-your boyfriend’s
name is, uh, Rocky?

03:18.866 --> 03:20.982
Like, pow?
Like the famous boxer?

03:21.077 --> 03:24.740
- No. Roxie—
- Angela’s boyfriend is a girl.

03:24.830 --> 03:28.118
Perhaps your religion won’t
allow you to accept that.

03:28.209 --> 03:31.701
Blood chemistry shows
unusually high levels
of relaxin.

03:31.796 --> 03:35.755
Hmm. Relaxin? That sounds
like something you could
get arrested for taking.

03:35.841 --> 03:39.925
it’s a naturalh/ occurring hormone
secreted during pregnancy.

03:40.012 --> 03:44.756
So ifshe was handcuﬁ‘ed
to protect her Virginity
didn ’t work out so well

04:24.265 --> 04:27.678
We last saw Ashley the afternoon
before her high school dance.

04:27.768 --> 04:29.759
It was the
End of Winter Dance.

04:29.854 --> 04:33.563
I remember because we made
a bunch ofjam that day.

04:33.649 --> 04:36.607
And Ashley was worried that
she’d smell like raspberries.

04:36.694 --> 04:39.481
Ashley never made it
to the dance?

04:39.572 --> 04:43.064
We had to wait
24 hours before she was
officially missing.

04:43.159 --> 04:45.275
Were there any
major developments...

04:45.369 --> 04:48.361
in your daughter’s life in
the weeks leading up to her death?

04:48.456 --> 04:52.825
He means drugs.
Was— Was Ashley
doing drugs?

04:52.960 --> 04:55.918
No, we don’t mean drugs.
No. No drugs.

04:56.005 --> 04:57.916
Were you aware that
your daughter was pregnant?

04:58.007 --> 05:01.215
ApproX/mate/y 72 weeks.

05:01.302 --> 05:03.918
Pregnant?
Ashley couldn’t have
been pregnant.

05:04.013 --> 05:07.597
She was. Do you have any idea
who might be the father?

05:09.018 --> 05:11.225
Is that who you think killed her—
the father of her child?

05:11.312 --> 05:14.725
- We’d like to talk to him.
- My daughter and / were ve/y close.

05:14.815 --> 05:17.932
And it simply isn’t possible
that she wouldn’t tell me
she was pregnant.

05:18.027 --> 05:19.688
I would appreciate
some insight...

05:19.778 --> 05:24.693
into the high number of injuries
your daughter sustained since puberty.

05:24.783 --> 05:27.365
50 now you ’re saying that
we abused our daughter?

05:27.453 --> 05:30.195
[Father]
It’s all right. They have to ask

05:30.289 --> 05:34.658
My daughter was an athlete.
She grew almost two feet
over the last four years.

05:34.752 --> 05:36.708
You can conﬁrm the injuries
with her chiropractor.

05:36.795 --> 05:38.501
We’re very sorry for your loss, sir.

05:38.589 --> 05:41.752
Then you shouldn’t say
such terrible things.

05:45.387 --> 05:47.969
Ashley wasn’t
a victim ofabuse.

05:48.057 --> 05:51.094
She was the victim of athleticism
and a competitive
disposition.

05:51.185 --> 05:53.221
See this remodeling
ofthe right thumb,

05:53.312 --> 05:55.928
the little finger,
the dorsal radial portion
of her wrist?

05:56.023 --> 05:58.435
- Volleyball, of course.
- That’s right. That’s very good.

05:58.526 --> 06:00.107
- Patellartendinitis.
-Jumper’s knee.

06:00.194 --> 06:02.856
- Wow. How’d you know that?
- Athlete, Bones.

06:02.947 --> 06:05.689
Thanks, Dr. Fitts.
We appreciate your help.

06:05.824 --> 06:07.906
Yeah.
Thanks

06:07.993 --> 06:11.201
Were you aware that
Ashley Clark was pregnant?

06:11.288 --> 06:13.950
No. No. Her
last appointment was
about six weeks ago.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.952
She didn’t mention it.

06:16.043 --> 06:19.581
Well, despite the fact that you
aren’t a real medical doctor,
you have been quite helpful.

06:19.713 --> 06:23.331
Thanks
Oh, you’re welcome.
Oh, and by the way.

06:24.510 --> 06:27.718
You aren’t a real
medical doctor either.

06:27.805 --> 06:29.170
Ouch.

06:41.694 --> 06:44.731
No hematoma, meaning the skull
was fractured postmortem.

06:44.822 --> 06:49.156
Probably when the body tumbled
out ofthe overhead bin.
Clunk.

06:50.327 --> 06:52.238
Very descriptively put.

06:52.329 --> 06:56.117
It has been pointed out to me
that I tend towards onomatopoeia.

06:56.208 --> 07:00.042
Dr. Saroyan. Why hasn’t
the body been de-ﬁeshed?

07:00.129 --> 07:02.370
I’m still conducting
the autopsy.

07:02.464 --> 07:04.455
If I can’t remove the flesh,
I can’t find cause ofdeath.

07:04.550 --> 07:06.757
Ifyou remove the flesh,
/ can’t find cause ofdeath.

07:06.844 --> 07:09.426
What flesh? The body
is completely desiccated.

07:09.513 --> 07:11.754
Any remaining indicators
are going to come ﬁom the bones.

07:11.849 --> 07:13.760
Not ifI can
rehydrate the tissue.

07:13.851 --> 07:17.469
Paleontologists ha ve used
Ruffer’s solution
successfully on mummies.

07:17.563 --> 07:19.178
But shush.

07:19.273 --> 07:22.857
The salt arrested
bacterial development.
There’s no decomp.

07:22.985 --> 07:26.102
|f| can rehydrate,
I can do a proper autopsy.
It will take too long.

07:26.238 --> 07:29.526
And a positive result
is debatable.
Lucky for me, I’m the boss.

07:30.409 --> 07:32.616
I claim one of my freebies.

07:32.703 --> 07:34.694
I claim one
of my freebie declines.

07:42.963 --> 07:44.954
[Sighs]

07:47.885 --> 07:49.375
[Knocking]

07:49.553 --> 07:52.386
Come on in.

07:52.473 --> 07:56.136
What can I do for you,
Mr. Clark?

07:56.226 --> 07:59.844
I wanted to tell you I suspected
my daughter was pregnant.

07:59.938 --> 08:01.974
All right. Have a seat.

08:02.066 --> 08:03.806
And you, uh,

08:03.942 --> 08:07.400
didn’t want to say anything
in front ofyour wife?
No.

08:08.739 --> 08:11.731
I found a pregnancy test in
the wastebasket in the bathroom.

08:11.825 --> 08:15.192
Your wife is still
young enough to have children.

08:15.287 --> 08:19.701
Sexual intercourse has not been
a part ofour marriage in several years.

08:19.792 --> 08:24.832
Did you, uh, talk to Ashley
about the pregnancy test?

08:24.922 --> 08:29.040
Yes. She denied it was hers.
She said it was a friend’s.

08:29.134 --> 08:31.216
She asked me
not to tell my wife.

08:31.303 --> 08:33.259
She called it a father-daughter secret.

08:34.807 --> 08:38.470
Was there a, uh—
a boy in Ashley’s life?

08:38.560 --> 08:42.519
Well, Ashley argued about
a boy with herfriend Becca.

08:42.606 --> 08:46.394
/ overheard it on the phone.
Didn ’t get a name.

08:46.485 --> 08:49.943
Mmm. All right, I see.
Well, I’ll look into it.

08:51.532 --> 08:53.989
Uh, / hope my wife...

08:54.076 --> 08:56.738
doesn’t have to find out that
I kept this huge
secret from her.

08:56.870 --> 08:59.031
/ don ’t think
she ’d forgive me.
Forgive you?

08:59.123 --> 09:02.331
[Sighs]
Considering how it turned out.

09:09.258 --> 09:14.218
His name is Donatello,
and he’s a rescue.
And he needs a good home.

09:14.304 --> 09:17.671
One caveat though.
He’s afraid ofthe wind.

09:19.643 --> 09:22.601
Wow. You really don’t want
this dog, do you?

09:22.730 --> 09:26.018
[Sniffles]
Is it because Donatello
is a stupid name?

09:28.986 --> 09:34.151
Yeah.
You’re breaking up with me.

09:36.744 --> 09:40.862
You don’t have to say
anything, Rox. It’s okay.
I do want to say something.

09:40.956 --> 09:43.618
Ange, you live
in the moment.
I know that.

09:43.709 --> 09:47.167
But moments are fleeting.
They pass.

09:47.254 --> 09:49.836
Yeah, but we decide
when the moments pass.

09:50.924 --> 09:53.040
This one has passed.

09:53.135 --> 09:55.592
Yeah.

09:55.679 --> 09:57.465
I’ve gotta think
about the future.

09:57.556 --> 10:00.013
Okay.

10:01.810 --> 10:03.801
[ Kisses]

10:09.526 --> 10:11.517
You gotta be kiddin’ me.

10:13.530 --> 10:15.782
Excuse me, Agent Booth?
Yeah?

10:15.866 --> 10:17.777
I’m Becca Hedgepeth.

10:17.868 --> 10:20.200
They told me
I could find you here.

10:20.287 --> 10:23.370
Wow.
Ashley Clark’s friend.

10:23.457 --> 10:25.698
Yeah.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.457
So you heard that
Ashley was murdered
on the news, right?

10:35.594 --> 10:38.381
Yeah.
It’s myjob to find out
who did it.

10:39.973 --> 10:43.431
Okay.
Well, I hope you do.

10:43.519 --> 10:46.886
According to her father,
he said the two ofyou
got into a fight...

10:46.980 --> 10:49.596
and you stopped
coming to the house.

10:49.691 --> 10:52.683
That’sjust because
Ashley went behind my back
with my boyfriend.

10:52.820 --> 10:57.405
What’s your boyfriend’s name?
Well, ex-boyfriend.
Uh, Rory Davis.

10:57.491 --> 10:59.903
Wait.

10:59.993 --> 11:04.737
Do you think that I was
jealous enough to kill my best friend?

11:04.832 --> 11:06.743
Or are you saying Rory did it?

11:06.834 --> 11:09.826
Well, you’re pregnant.
Emotions run high
during that situation.

11:09.920 --> 11:13.037
Me and Ashley
would’ve gotten past it,

11:13.131 --> 11:15.383
because she broke up
with Rory too.

11:15.467 --> 11:19.051
Looks like I’m gonna
have to talk to
“Love ‘Em and Leave ‘Em” Rory.

11:19.137 --> 11:23.130
Okay. Very careful.
The tissue’s fragile.

11:23.225 --> 11:28.219
All right, ready?
On my count.
One, two—

11:28.313 --> 11:31.020
Now, we’re gonna complete/y
submerge her in a bath
ofsodium carbonate,

11:31.108 --> 11:34.396
aqueous formalin
and ethyl alcohol.
Good.

11:34.486 --> 11:36.522
And some where between
24 and 48 hours from now,

11:36.613 --> 11:38.353
she should look
practically human again.

11:38.448 --> 11:43.033
Ready?
Anduga

11:43.120 --> 11:46.658
/ got the trace back
on those red ﬁbers
you found in her hair.

11:46.748 --> 11:50.240
They’re trilobal.
Two red strands, one
blue strand woven together.

11:50.335 --> 11:53.122
Given the length and texture,
they deﬁnitely came
from an automobile.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.499
50 the killer must ha ve
transported Ash/e y’s body...

11:55.591 --> 11:57.627
from wherever she was killed
into the salt pile.

11:57.718 --> 12:00.130
Can you narrow down
what kind of car?

12:00.220 --> 12:02.211
Yeah. I’m running
the ﬁbers through FA C /D.

12:02.306 --> 12:05.719
That should be able
to give Booth
make and model and year.

12:05.809 --> 12:09.142
[Watch Beeping]
Ooh. Time-out for Allah.

12:12.399 --> 12:14.765
[A nge/a ]
Hey, Arastoo.
Hello, Ange/a.

12:16.403 --> 12:20.316
Hey.
Um, listen.

12:20.407 --> 12:22.864
Do you need me
anymore here today?
’Cause I could really use a—

12:22.951 --> 12:26.318
Angela.
What’s the matter?

12:26.413 --> 12:29.029
Roxie and / broke up, and ljust—

12:29.124 --> 12:33.663
- I’m gonna take Angela
for a cup of coffee, okay?
- Sure, yeah. Go.

12:33.754 --> 12:35.619
This is a simple murder.
Solves itself.

12:41.219 --> 12:43.835
Okay, Rory Davis?

12:43.972 --> 12:48.557
Yeah.
A little warning, dude.
I’m only the Hulk when I get pissed.

12:48.644 --> 12:51.602
Listen, we’d like to talk
to you about Ashley Clark.

12:51.688 --> 12:55.351

“Got all 0 ver. ”

- That you had sex with two girls

24:56.412 --> 24:57.822
So you think this whole
pact thing is true?

24:57.914 --> 25:00.451
There have been
many instances in hist0/y...

25:00.541 --> 25:02.202
where women grouped together
to raise their children.

25:02.293 --> 25:05.626
And the men become
nothing more to them
than sperm donors.

25:05.713 --> 25:08.921
The “walking marriages” ofthe Mosuo
in the Himalayas, for example.

25:10.301 --> 25:12.212
Right. Okay,
so you think that...

25:12.303 --> 25:15.170
the Himalayan “Momos”
just killed each other
when things got dicey?

25:15.264 --> 25:17.255
Killing is a more
male response.

25:17.350 --> 25:19.261
Women tend
more towards shunning.

25:19.352 --> 25:21.388
I might be able to figure out
the nature of
the girls’ relationship.

25:21.479 --> 25:24.095
- How?
- Let me at the alpha girl.

25:25.400 --> 25:27.140
Psychologically, I mean.

25:31.531 --> 25:33.738
[Saroyan ]
Mr. I/aziri,
do you have any idea...

25:33.825 --> 25:37.488
where all the monitors on
the forensic platform have gone?

25:37.578 --> 25:40.536
I appropriated them.
I sent you an e-mail.

25:40.623 --> 25:45.458
Well, I didn’t have a monitor
to check my e-mail.
You have created a virtual skeleton.

25:45.586 --> 25:48.248
It was your idea,
Dr. Saroyan.
No, I don’t recall—

25:48.339 --> 25:50.671
In speaking
of Dr. Brennan,
you said to me,

25:50.758 --> 25:52.749
“Tell her that unless
she can think ofa way...

25:52.844 --> 25:56.678
to examine the bones while
leaving the flesh intact,
you are both out of luck.”

25:56.764 --> 25:59.005
Well, I’ll make sure
you get the credit
for this with Dr. Brennan.

25:59.142 --> 26:01.098
No, no, no, no, no.
You don’t want credit?

26:01.185 --> 26:04.268
No. I would rather
not be the person to
point out to Dr. Brennan...

26:04.355 --> 26:06.732
that she was incorrect
about retaining
the soft tissue...

26:06.816 --> 26:08.807
at the expense of
exposing the skeleton.

26:08.943 --> 26:12.276
Meaning you found something?
I would never have seen this
on the actual bone.

26:12.363 --> 26:15.275
But when I blew up
the digital X-ray—

26:16.325 --> 26:18.236
Here.
/n the middle ear,

26:18.327 --> 26:21.490
there is a hairline fracture
on the stapes.

26:21.581 --> 26:24.038
What does that
suggest to you?

26:24.125 --> 26:26.161
Violence, Dr. Saroyan.

26:36.804 --> 26:38.840
Miss Montenegro?

26:38.931 --> 26:42.094
Yeah. Hi, Arastoo.
How are you?

26:42.185 --> 26:46.349
I would like to pass on
to you my condolences that
your heart has been broken.

26:46.439 --> 26:49.431
Oh. Here we go.

26:51.486 --> 26:53.397
Are you gonna quote
the Koran?
No, no.

26:53.488 --> 26:58.482
I put together a CD
with some songs that
I have found to be cathartic.

26:58.576 --> 27:00.362
Oh.

27:00.453 --> 27:05.163
“I Hope There is Someone”
by Mr. Antony and thejohnsons.

27:05.249 --> 27:07.740
“Breathe Me” by Sia.

27:07.835 --> 27:10.872
“Heartbeats” by
Mr.josé Gonzales.

27:10.963 --> 27:14.547
“Fade Into You”
by Mazzy Star.

27:14.634 --> 27:17.046
This is not a person,
but a band.

27:17.136 --> 27:20.219
“Lullaby of Loneliness”
by Adam English.

27:20.306 --> 27:25.642
And, of course,
the finest of
the melancholy songs—

27:25.728 --> 27:27.684
[Sighs]
“Dust in the Wind.”

27:27.772 --> 27:29.683
Very melancholy, that.

27:29.774 --> 27:32.766
Uh, I wish you peace,
Miss Montenegro,

27:32.860 --> 27:34.691
and | wish that
you find love again.

27:34.779 --> 27:37.316
Thank you, Arastoo.

27:37.406 --> 27:39.362
Thanks very much.

27:53.923 --> 27:57.256
[Device Beeps]
Dr. Saroyan?

27:57.343 --> 27:59.880
Tell Dr. Brennan
she cannot have
the remains yet.

27:59.971 --> 28:02.337
Hovering will not
make this go any faster.

28:02.431 --> 28:05.047
Dr. Brennan
required me to hover.

28:05.142 --> 28:08.305
How’s about you go
bank a prayer and give me
a little breathing space?

28:08.396 --> 28:11.763
I apologize.
I quip sometimes.

28:11.858 --> 28:14.065
Believe me, it is
nothing compared to...

28:14.151 --> 28:17.769
the First Battalion,
Ninth Marine Regiment,
Regimental Combat Team One.

28:22.076 --> 28:24.408
Glycerin, please?

28:28.791 --> 28:30.827
What are you going to do?

28:31.919 --> 28:34.251
Ruffer’s only
gets us so far.

28:34.338 --> 28:37.546
So I’m gonna inject
some glycerin around
the soft tissue of the ear.

28:37.633 --> 28:40.796
Oh. To see ifthere’s
any tissue damage,

28:40.887 --> 28:43.845
which might explain
the fractured stapes.

28:49.478 --> 28:50.888
[A [vssa ]
A pact?

28:50.980 --> 28:53.596
There’s no pact.
The papers totally
made that up.

28:53.691 --> 28:55.522
Okay. But you are
very close.

28:55.610 --> 28:58.943
Well, yeah.
We played on the same team
together since we were freshmen.

28:59.030 --> 29:01.612
We’ve traveled a lot too.
I mean, we’ve been through
a lot together.

29:01.699 --> 29:05.112
- Boys—
- Boys come and go.

29:05.202 --> 29:08.569
You know. But your friends,
that’s who you can really count on, right?

29:08.706 --> 29:11.368
Counton?
Yeah. They don’t
pressure you like boys,

29:11.459 --> 29:13.450
like parents.

29:13.544 --> 29:15.000
Uh, pressure?

29:15.087 --> 29:16.918
Pressure to succeed, yeah.

29:17.006 --> 29:19.122
Well, you’re
a very high achiever,
Miss Howland.

29:19.216 --> 29:22.083
Student body president.
Valedictorian.

29:22.178 --> 29:24.385
Full scholarship to Amherst.

29:24.513 --> 29:27.380
All ofwhich went away
when you got pregnant.
Yeah, that’s okay.

29:27.475 --> 29:30.012
I mean, I’m totally cool
with being a mother.

29:30.102 --> 29:32.013
Is it a coincidence that
once you got pregnant,

29:32.104 --> 29:35.187
seven ofthe others
on the volleyball team
did the same?

29:35.274 --> 29:39.483
It’s not my fault that people want
to be like me. I’m a natural leader.

29:40.780 --> 29:43.396
They look to you
as an example.

29:43.491 --> 29:45.698
It was my idea that we all
get a house together,

29:45.785 --> 29:47.616
help each other raise our kids.

29:47.745 --> 29:49.155
Where would the money
come from?
Oh.

29:49.246 --> 29:52.738
Um, I mean, we’d all put in.
I’d figured out how much we’d need.

29:52.875 --> 29:54.615
$5,000 each?
That’s right.

29:54.710 --> 29:56.621
Wait. How did you know?

29:56.712 --> 29:58.828
- You said it wasn’t a pact.
- Mm-mmm.

29:58.923 --> 30:02.461
Then how do you explain
that four ofyou got pregnant
from the same boy?

30:02.551 --> 30:04.462
He seems
an unlikely choice.

30:04.553 --> 30:08.137
Clinton wasn’t a choice.
I didn’t plan the baby.

30:08.224 --> 30:11.261
I’d...just found out
I’d won the scholarship,

30:11.352 --> 30:14.560
and my parents started
to plan my whole life.

30:16.065 --> 30:18.977
I just went to the park.
I couldn’t... breathe.

30:19.068 --> 30:21.480
I couldn’t think.
[Deep Breath]

30:21.570 --> 30:23.856
Too much pressure?

30:24.865 --> 30:27.481
Yeah.
And Clinton was there.

30:27.576 --> 30:32.286
And I was crying, and Ijust—
I felt like I was being banished.

30:32.373 --> 30:35.240
You know?
I mean, nobody
asked me what I wanted.

30:35.334 --> 30:39.828
And Clinton understood.
And he held my hand,
and he let me cry.

30:39.922 --> 30:43.835
And, you know,
one thing led to another.

30:43.968 --> 30:46.334
And he’s been great.
Great how?

30:46.429 --> 30:50.513
Well, he’s a kid.
You know, he doesn’t
really want to raise kids.

30:50.599 --> 30:54.183
Right. Maybe that’s why
the other girls chose him
to get them pregnant.

30:54.270 --> 30:57.762
Yeah.Yeah.
And it’s going to be great.

30:57.857 --> 31:01.475
We all are gonna have
these cute kids, and we’ll
all be there for each other.

31:01.569 --> 31:03.309
Except Ashley.

31:06.032 --> 31:08.990
Yeah.
[Sighs]

31:09.076 --> 31:10.987
What exactly
are we doing?

31:11.078 --> 31:13.455
I couldn’t see
any contusions around the ear.

31:13.539 --> 31:17.578
But perimortem bruising
is often only visible
under certain light wavelengths.

31:17.710 --> 31:20.201
You’re using colorimetrics?
That’s right.

31:20.296 --> 31:22.252
I read an article
in a forensicjournal.

31:22.339 --> 31:24.295
Ajapanese scientist
published his study.

31:24.383 --> 31:26.965
We read the same article.
Could you turn on the UV. light?

31:28.345 --> 31:30.131
Look at that.

31:30.264 --> 31:33.848
Are you switching teams,
Mr. I/azﬁi?
N o, n o.

31:33.934 --> 31:35.890
My preference is
forensics anthropology.

31:35.978 --> 31:38.310
But Dr. Saroyan’s use
of colorimetrics was thrilling.

31:40.816 --> 31:43.228
Look at the monitor.

31:43.319 --> 31:45.605
Assuming
suﬁicient force,

31:45.696 --> 31:48.153
that perimortem bruising
explains your stapes ﬁacture.

31:48.240 --> 31:51.152
The bruise is directly
on top ofthe vagus nerve.

31:51.243 --> 31:53.950
And?
Cowabunga!

31:54.038 --> 31:57.576
- What?
- When the vagus nerve is
triggered with enough force,

31:57.666 --> 32:00.829
the victim will go into
cardiac arrest and die.

32:02.379 --> 32:04.290
You have discovered
the cause ofdeath.

32:16.560 --> 32:20.144
The tissue damage
is distributed evenly.
What does that indicate?

32:20.231 --> 32:21.812
That it was a single blow.

32:21.899 --> 32:24.606
Whatever did this
is completely flat and round.

32:24.735 --> 32:28.478
Some kind of hammer?
Anyone interested in
our mysterious red fiber?

32:28.572 --> 32:30.153
You identified the vehicle?

32:30.241 --> 32:33.779
Late model German sedan.
Mercedes or BMW.

32:33.869 --> 32:35.450
Let Booth know.

32:35.538 --> 32:39.156
And uh, just so you know,
Arastoo is praying again.

32:39.291 --> 32:44.536
Either that, or he’s doing
a very repetitive yoga move.
Is that appropriate in the lab?

32:44.630 --> 32:47.372
Some of us take coffee breaks.
Some of us take smoke breaks.

32:47.508 --> 32:50.250
Mr. Vaziri takes
a spiritual break.
Who smokes?

32:50.344 --> 32:52.175
Nobody.

32:52.263 --> 32:56.552
Not very often anyway.
Just very rarely
in times of great stress.

32:56.642 --> 33:00.134
Ifyou had released
the remains to me when I’d asked,

33:00.229 --> 33:04.598
and Mr. Vaziri had removed
the flesh, then we’d never
have found cause ofdeath.

33:04.692 --> 33:07.980
- Thank you.
- Why are you thanking me?
I’m simply stating a fact.

33:08.070 --> 33:10.527
I’m thanking you for stating
the fact that you were wrong.

33:10.614 --> 33:13.447
Oh. You’re welcome.

33:13.534 --> 33:17.447
The odds of hitting the vagus nerve
by accident are very slight.

33:17.538 --> 33:19.745
So do you think
this was done by someone
who knew what they were doing?

33:19.832 --> 33:23.495
Yes. Someone
who’s very familiar
with human anatomy.

33:23.586 --> 33:25.827
Like a physiologist
or a doctor...

33:25.921 --> 33:28.003
or a chiropractor.

33:28.090 --> 33:30.706
Let’s check out the victim’s
chiropractor’s ride.

33:32.052 --> 33:35.670
S 0 Dr. Fitts drives
a 2007 BM W sedan.

33:35.764 --> 33:40.428
- So you got a warrant?
- There are 1,208
BMW sedans in DC.

33:40.519 --> 33:42.726
- So you didn’t get a warrant?
- But how many of those drivers...

33:42.813 --> 33:44.644
know how to kill
using the vagus nerve?

33:44.732 --> 33:47.815
And how many of those drivers
had access to the victim?

33:47.902 --> 33:51.611
And owned chiropractic tools
we might be able to match
with the murder weapon?

33:51.697 --> 33:54.439
Guys, no warrant.

33:54.533 --> 33:56.740
IfBooth and I hadn’t
questioned Dr. Fitts,
we could mount...

33:56.827 --> 33:59.113
one ofour clever
undercover operations.

34:04.168 --> 34:07.626
Hey, not me.
But I do have a great idea.

34:11.467 --> 34:13.753
How long have
we been married?

34:13.844 --> 34:16.301
Just concentrate on your symptoms.
That’s all he’s gonna ask about.

34:16.430 --> 34:19.638
Okay.
I’ll look for
this thing here.

34:19.725 --> 34:22.387
Brennan says it’s
the murder weapon.

34:22.478 --> 34:25.015
So you heard about
me and Roxie?

34:25.105 --> 34:27.016
Yeah. I’m sorry.

34:27.107 --> 34:29.393
Oh, no.
Really, it’s absolutely fine.

34:29.526 --> 34:35.192
Okay.
I also had a little
afternoon delight with Hodgins.

34:35.282 --> 34:37.523
But let’sjust say
it’s not really his thing.

34:37.660 --> 34:39.946
[Chuckles]
Again, I’m sorry.

34:40.037 --> 34:42.119
No. It’s totally fine.

34:42.206 --> 34:44.197
Then why are you telling me?

34:44.291 --> 34:48.034
Brennan approves ofthe way
that I conduct my love life.

34:48.128 --> 34:49.789
Oh.

34:49.880 --> 34:52.371
Yeah.

34:52.466 --> 34:54.377
What’s wrong with
living in the moment?

34:56.679 --> 34:58.590
Nothing. Nothing,
as long as it’s
working for you.

34:58.681 --> 35:00.546
Oh, it is, definitely.

35:00.683 --> 35:02.423
If it weren’t—
No, it-it-it is.

35:02.559 --> 35:04.595
Well, ifit weren’t—
It is.

35:04.687 --> 35:08.054
Ifit weren’t,
I’d suggest to you—

35:10.818 --> 35:13.981
What?
You won’t like it.

35:14.071 --> 35:17.154
Oh, no. I’m-I’m—
I’m happy living in the moment.

35:17.241 --> 35:20.199
What you say
is merely interesting.

35:20.286 --> 35:25.030
Well, what I would advise you to do
is remove sex from the situation.

35:27.084 --> 35:28.995
I don’t like that.

35:29.086 --> 35:30.997
You’re a beautiful woman.

35:31.088 --> 35:33.921
You’re confident
in your sexuality,
which is laudable.

35:34.049 --> 35:37.507
But you need to connect
with people on another level.
Why?

35:37.594 --> 35:42.714
Why? Because sexual attraction’s only
one facet ofthe human romantic experience.

35:42.808 --> 35:45.345
So don’t have sex?

35:45.436 --> 35:50.305
I— I’d suggest you be celibate
for, say, six months.

35:50.399 --> 35:52.355
[Scoffs]
Oh, my God.

35:52.443 --> 35:56.027
Six months?
Why not 10 years?

35:57.323 --> 35:59.405
You asked my opinion,
and that’s it.

35:59.491 --> 36:02.358
Forego sex in favor
of other connections.

36:02.453 --> 36:04.364
Shouldn’t we have, like,
a cover story...

36:04.455 --> 36:07.242
in order to reassure
the chiropractor
that we’re married?

36:07.333 --> 36:10.700
[Door Opens]
M r. Sweets?

36:10.794 --> 36:13.661
Yeah.
Um—

36:13.756 --> 36:16.247
Okay, honey.
We’re up.

36:16.342 --> 36:19.004
This is us—
a happily married couple.

36:19.094 --> 36:22.086
Uh, help me,
please.

36:22.181 --> 36:24.297
Okay.
Thank you.

36:24.391 --> 36:26.552
[ Fitts ]
So you’ve had some discomfort
in your lo wer back?

36:26.643 --> 36:28.554
Uh, yeah, yeah.

As a fireman, I often
