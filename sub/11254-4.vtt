00:02.502 --> 00:03.795
- Hey, baby.

00:03.878 --> 00:05.630
- Hi, babe.

00:05.714 --> 00:09.718
- Are you watching
an old Bill Clinton speech?

00:09.801 --> 00:12.262
{\an1}- Alicia told me to look at it
to get some tips.

00:12.345 --> 00:16.099
You know, I'm thinking about
using his thumb-pointing thing.

00:16.181 --> 00:17.267
{\an1}Lolli,

00:17.350 --> 00:20.603
you look great
in those tight pants.

00:20.687 --> 00:22.439
They hug you just right,

00:22.522 --> 00:24.315
and I'm okay with that.

00:24.399 --> 00:26.693
{\an3}- Oh, Boyce,
that <i> does</i> sound like

00:26.776 --> 00:28.528
{\an3}something Bill Clinton
would say!

00:28.611 --> 00:30.739
{\an1}- [chuckles]
Hey, babe, what's all this?

00:30.822 --> 00:33.283
{\an3}- Well, I know you have
that photo op today

00:33.366 --> 00:34.951
for Habitat for Humanity,

00:35.034 --> 00:37.203
{\an3}so I got you
some things to wear

00:37.287 --> 00:39.122
{\an3}for when you're building
the houses,

00:39.205 --> 00:41.124
to make you
look rugged.

00:41.207 --> 00:42.459
- Ooh, okay.

00:42.542 --> 00:43.877
{\an1}A little tool belt,
all right.

00:43.960 --> 00:46.421
{\an1}And, mm,
flannel shirt.

00:46.504 --> 00:48.715
{\an1}Boots. Okay.
Thank you, baby.

00:48.798 --> 00:50.967
- Yeah, well, you know,
I may not know as much

00:51.050 --> 00:53.428
{\an3}about campaigning
as Alicia does,

00:53.511 --> 00:57.140
{\an3}but I do know how to make
my candidate look good.

00:57.223 --> 00:58.975
This is my field.

00:59.058 --> 01:01.811
Can't nobody play on it.

01:01.895 --> 01:03.146
- How do I look?

01:03.229 --> 01:05.022
- You look ridiculous.

01:06.232 --> 01:07.984
{\an1}- Well--well, Lolli thought
it would help me

01:08.067 --> 01:09.486
{\an1}look like one of
the common people.

01:09.569 --> 01:12.155
{\an3}- You look like
one of the Village People.

01:12.238 --> 01:13.490
- What's wrong with it?

01:13.573 --> 01:15.158
{\an3}- Well, it's too clean
and perfect,

01:15.241 --> 01:18.036
{\an3}and could you have gotten
a smaller hammer?

01:18.119 --> 01:21.206
{\an3}Did you steal this
from a cobbler?

01:21.289 --> 01:24.375
{\an1}- You know better than
to insult a man's hammer.

01:24.459 --> 01:26.586
{\an3}- We'll stop off at Goodwill
on the way to the site

01:26.669 --> 01:29.380
{\an3}and get you some jeans
that don't have pressed cuffs.

01:29.464 --> 01:31.674
{\an1}- I don't know.
I don't know.

01:31.758 --> 01:32.842
This is Lolli's field.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.845
{\an3}We're not supposed
to be playing on it.

01:35.929 --> 01:37.514
{\an1}- Look, the whole reason
we're doing this

01:37.597 --> 01:40.099
{\an1}is so that you can connect
with the working man,

01:40.183 --> 01:41.726
{\an1}and the working man
doesn't have a--

01:41.810 --> 01:44.521
Gucci makes a wrench?

01:44.604 --> 01:46.189
- It came with the cologne.

01:46.272 --> 01:49.234
It was a gift set.

{\an9}Honey...

02:24.185 --> 02:25.728
{\an8}What's wrong, baby?

02:25.812 --> 02:27.564
{\an7}- [shivering]
Oh, I'm so cold.

02:27.647 --> 02:29.357
{\an7}It was freezing
down there, babe.

02:29.440 --> 02:31.985
{\an8}I-I think I got
the hypothermia.

02:32.068 --> 02:35.321
{\an9}- Aww...
Well, let me warm you up.

02:35.405 --> 02:36.573
{\an8}- Uh, no, you know,

02:36.656 --> 02:38.116
{\an7}I don't have on
any clothes under here,

02:38.199 --> 02:40.785
{\an7}and I'm feeling
kind of shy.

02:40.869 --> 02:42.745
{\an8}- Well, I'm not shy.

02:42.829 --> 02:45.874
{\an9}Let me get a look at that
manly, house-building body.

{\an7}- [stammers]
Uh, no means no.

02:49.168 --> 02:52.130
{\an7}Okay!
Look, I changed my mind.

02:52.213 --> 02:53.506
{\an8}How about we go on upstairs

02:53.590 --> 02:55.758
{\an8}and, uh, smash?

02:55.842 --> 02:59.262
{\an9}- What happened to
the clothes I bought you, Boyce?

02:59.345 --> 03:01.180
{\an7}- All right, Lolli,
here's the thing.

03:01.264 --> 03:03.141
{\an8}Alicia thought--
- Hold on.

03:03.224 --> 03:04.809
{\an8}I know she's not
trying to tell me

03:04.893 --> 03:06.603
{\an8}how <i> my</i> man should dress.

03:06.686 --> 03:09.105
{\an7}- Lolli, this isn't about
anybody's man.

03:09.188 --> 03:10.607
{\an8}She's a pro.

03:10.690 --> 03:12.942
{\an9}- Does she know who's been
keeping you fly

03:13.026 --> 03:14.903
{\an8}for the past 20 years?

03:14.986 --> 03:16.529
{\an9}Who took you
out of parachute pants

03:16.613 --> 03:19.115
{\an9}and put you
in baggy jeans?

03:19.198 --> 03:20.617
{\an3}Who put you
in five-button suits

03:20.700 --> 03:24.162
{\an3}when everybody else
was still wearing two?

03:24.245 --> 03:26.998
{\an3}And who gave you cornrows
for the Stevie Wonder tribute?

03:27.081 --> 03:28.958
{\an1}- Oh, man, I wish
Stevie could've seen

03:29.042 --> 03:30.501
that one right there.

03:30.585 --> 03:33.713
{\an3}- Boyce, Alicia needs
to back off.

03:33.796 --> 03:36.966
{\an1}- Look, babe, I know that
she can be a little abrasive.

03:37.050 --> 03:38.843
- A little abrasive?

03:38.927 --> 03:40.428
You could use her personality

03:40.511 --> 03:43.222
{\an3}to sand down
the side of a boat.

03:43.306 --> 03:45.016
{\an1}- All right, Lolli,
here's the thing.

03:45.099 --> 03:46.809
{\an1}She knows what she's doing,
all right?

03:46.893 --> 03:50.897
{\an1}So we're gonna have to learn
to work together, okay?

03:50.980 --> 03:52.523
- Okay.
- Okay.

03:52.607 --> 03:55.818
- Okay.
- Hey! All right.

03:55.902 --> 03:57.820
{\an1}So, um...

03:57.904 --> 04:00.949
{\an1}smash-wise,
where are we at on that?

04:01.032 --> 04:02.158
- No, thanks.

04:02.241 --> 04:04.661
I'm feelin' shy.

04:04.744 --> 04:08.122
{\an1}- But I got
all these tools.

04:09.916 --> 04:12.251
- Ah.

04:12.335 --> 04:13.544
Here you go.

04:13.628 --> 04:15.338
I just want to say,
I killed it

04:15.421 --> 04:17.089
at the
voter registration drive.

04:17.173 --> 04:18.173
- Thank you, Fletcher.

04:18.257 --> 04:19.926
{\an1}- Oh, no, please,
call me Stamps.

04:20.009 --> 04:21.302
{\an3}- Where did you get
that nickname?

04:21.386 --> 04:22.971
{\an1}- Eh, well, you know,
I'd rather not say.

04:23.054 --> 04:25.014
It's kind of personal.
- All right.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.392
{\an1}- You know,
I was seeing this woman,

04:27.475 --> 04:28.559
and she, uh--

04:28.643 --> 04:29.894
{\an1}she called me Stamps
because

04:29.978 --> 04:33.189
{\an1}when you lick me,
I stick to you.

04:33.272 --> 04:34.565
- Enough said.

04:34.649 --> 04:37.235
{\an1}- Then I take you
where you want to go.

04:37.318 --> 04:39.028
- Well, Stamps, given that,

04:39.112 --> 04:40.655
{\an3}I guess
I shouldn't be surprised

04:40.738 --> 04:42.532
{\an3}that every single voter
you registered

04:42.615 --> 04:45.535
{\an3}is a woman
from 18 to 25.

04:45.618 --> 04:47.537
{\an1}- You wanted names?
I got you names.

04:47.620 --> 04:50.915
{\an3}- And phone numbers
and relationship status.

04:50.999 --> 04:53.001
- Don't hate the data.

04:53.084 --> 04:55.420
{\an3}- You are off
voter registration duty.

04:55.503 --> 04:57.588
{\an1}- Oh! Why?

04:57.672 --> 04:59.215
- Hey, everybody.

04:59.298 --> 05:01.092
- Boyce, you're late;
they're expecting you

05:01.175 --> 05:02.593
{\an3}in a half hour
at the county fair

05:02.677 --> 05:04.929
{\an3}to judge the
butter sculpture contest.

05:05.013 --> 05:06.264
- What's the rush?

05:06.347 --> 05:07.390
- Well, it's hot,

05:07.473 --> 05:09.642
and it's butter.

05:09.726 --> 05:10.893
- For your information,

05:10.977 --> 05:13.021
{\an1}we're late
for a very good reason.

05:13.104 --> 05:16.190
{\an1}I had Boyce speak to
the St. Louis Mass Chorus.

05:16.274 --> 05:18.526
{\an1}They were eating out of
my baby's hand.

05:18.609 --> 05:21.195
{\an3}- Of course they were.
They were voting for him anyway.

05:21.279 --> 05:24.198
{\an3}You were literally
preaching to the choir.

05:24.282 --> 05:25.658
- But if you had been there--

05:25.742 --> 05:26.909
- I would have stopped you.

05:26.993 --> 05:28.578
- I'd like to see you try.

05:28.661 --> 05:31.080
{\an1}- Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, ladies.

05:31.164 --> 05:33.332
{\an1}There's plenty of me
to go around.

05:33.416 --> 05:35.209
- Actually, there's not.

05:35.293 --> 05:36.544
I've got you booked all day.

05:36.627 --> 05:38.296
{\an3}After the fair,
you're addressing

05:38.379 --> 05:39.630
the Welders Local 558,

05:39.714 --> 05:41.424
and then we've got
the Kiwanis Club.

05:41.507 --> 05:42.717
Play up your charity work.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.635
{\an3}You sang on
"We Are the World," right?

05:44.719 --> 05:46.971
- Well, I was supposed to,

05:47.055 --> 05:50.266
{\an1}but me and Cyndi Lauper
got into a beef,

05:50.349 --> 05:52.727
{\an1}so I told Quincy Jones,
I said, "Hey, man,

05:52.810 --> 05:55.354
{\an1}you gonna have to
make a choice."

05:55.438 --> 05:57.315
{\an1}Well, you know
what happened on that.

05:57.398 --> 05:59.942
- Okay, right,
and after the Kiwanis,

06:00.026 --> 06:01.652
you've got
the teachers' union.

06:01.736 --> 06:03.112
- That's a big day.

06:03.196 --> 06:04.739
{\an1}I don't see Mayor Saxby
doing all that stuff.

06:04.822 --> 06:05.782
- Well, he doesn't need to.

06:05.865 --> 06:06.783
He's got a super PAC

06:06.866 --> 06:08.242
{\an1}raising more money
every week

06:08.326 --> 06:10.411
{\an1}than we've raised
this entire campaign.

06:10.495 --> 06:11.704
All right, let's go.

06:11.788 --> 06:13.873
Butter's melting.

06:15.041 --> 06:16.876
- You're melting, witch.

06:16.959 --> 06:18.086
- Lolli!

06:18.169 --> 06:19.378
- She didn't hear me.

06:19.462 --> 06:21.130
<i>- Yes, she did.</i>

06:22.799 --> 06:24.258
[crickets chirping]

06:24.342 --> 06:25.968

06:27.428 --> 06:28.721
- Loll?

06:28.805 --> 06:30.056
Hey, babe, I, um,

06:30.139 --> 06:31.641
{\an1}brought you
a little something back

06:31.724 --> 06:33.518
from the county fair.

06:33.601 --> 06:36.270
Deep-fried Oreo.

06:36.354 --> 06:38.773
Double Stuf.

06:38.856 --> 06:41.109
- Sounds delicious.

06:43.236 --> 06:44.779
- Babe, you okay?

06:44.862 --> 06:46.322
{\an3}- I'm okay.

06:46.405 --> 06:47.657
{\an3}Boyce...
[sighing]

06:47.740 --> 06:49.992
{\an3}It's just that
we've always done

06:50.076 --> 06:51.160
everything together,

06:51.244 --> 06:52.995
and now that you're
running for mayor,

06:53.079 --> 06:55.373
{\an3}I want to help you,
and every time I try,

06:55.456 --> 06:58.042
{\an3}I run up against
the Jolly Mean Giant.

06:58.126 --> 06:59.418
- [laughing]

06:59.502 --> 07:01.003
That's a good one, babe.

07:01.087 --> 07:03.965
{\an1}Look, Lolli,
this campaign needs you.

07:04.048 --> 07:05.258
I need you.

07:05.341 --> 07:06.384
{\an1}I mean,
you <i> are</i> going with me

07:06.467 --> 07:07.969
{\an1}to the Rotary breakfast
tomorrow.

07:08.052 --> 07:11.514
{\an3}- Is Biggie Talls
gonna be there?

07:11.597 --> 07:13.516
- Well, I mean,
it was her plan.

07:13.599 --> 07:15.726
- Then no.
- [scoffs]

07:15.810 --> 07:17.019
- She gets on my nerves,

07:17.103 --> 07:20.148
{\an1}and I want to put
my own stuff together.

07:20.231 --> 07:22.483
- Well, then, you know,

07:22.567 --> 07:23.818
maybe you should.

07:23.901 --> 07:25.236
- Then I will.

07:25.319 --> 07:26.571
{\an1}Wait, how?

07:26.654 --> 07:28.489
{\an3}- You know, I was thinking,
remember when Alicia

07:28.573 --> 07:32.285
{\an3}mentioned that Mayor Saxby
gets his money from a super PAC?

07:32.368 --> 07:35.538
{\an3}I see no reason why
you can't start your own.

07:35.621 --> 07:37.123
- Keep talking.

07:37.206 --> 07:38.374
- I mean, that way,

07:38.457 --> 07:39.750
you can raise money for me,

07:39.834 --> 07:43.004
{\an3}yet be separate
from the campaign.

07:43.087 --> 07:45.715
{\an1}- And separate from
the campaign manager?

07:45.798 --> 07:48.509
{\an3}- Yeah, Alicia can't
tell you a damn thing,

07:48.593 --> 07:49.969
and it's the law.

07:50.052 --> 07:51.888
- God bless America.

07:51.971 --> 07:53.181
- Yeah. Hey.

07:53.264 --> 07:54.432
{\an3}All right.
I like that.

07:54.515 --> 07:55.600
Well, you know what?

07:55.683 --> 07:57.351
{\an3}We should celebrate
your super PAC

07:57.435 --> 08:01.272
{\an3}with some of that smashi''
we was talking about earlier.

08:01.355 --> 08:02.857
- Right, but if the super PAC

08:02.940 --> 08:04.901
{\an1}is supposed to be separate
from the candidate,

08:04.984 --> 08:08.404
{\an1}wouldn't that be
a conflict of interest?

08:08.487 --> 08:11.157
{\an3}- I mean,
I don't have a conflict.

08:11.240 --> 08:12.742
Do you have interests?

08:12.825 --> 08:15.912
{\an1}- I'm gonna go run some water
in the tub.

08:15.995 --> 08:17.246
- Hey. All right.

08:17.330 --> 08:18.414
- Care to join me?
- Oh, shoot.

08:18.497 --> 08:20.333
Come on, now.
Oh, wait.

08:20.416 --> 08:22.835
I'm--I'm gonna get
the Oreo, though.

08:25.755 --> 08:26.380
{\an1}- All right, Stamps.
Here we go.

08:26.464 --> 08:28.591
- Activate super PAC.

08:28.674 --> 08:30.635
{\an1}- Okay, I got highlighters
in every color,

08:30.718 --> 08:32.636
{\an1}Post-its,
and those little labels

08:32.720 --> 08:35.097
{\an1}that tell you
where to sign stuff.

08:35.181 --> 08:36.724
{\an3}- See,
we don't need Alicia.

08:36.807 --> 08:38.351
{\an3}Where'd you get
all these supplies?

08:38.433 --> 08:41.354
{\an1}- Alicia had the box
on her desk.

08:41.437 --> 08:42.980
- We're killing it!

08:43.063 --> 08:44.440
[chuckles]
- Okay.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.734
Let's figure out
this fund raiser.

08:46.817 --> 08:48.569
What are we thinking?

08:48.653 --> 08:49.737
Fashion show?

08:49.820 --> 08:52.949
{\an3}- Nah.
Wet T-shirt contest.

08:53.032 --> 08:54.825
- Heck no.
- [scoffs]

08:54.909 --> 08:56.494
{\an3}Man, this is hard.
I don't know.

08:56.577 --> 08:57.995
{\an1}- Okay, Stamps,
you got to think.

08:58.079 --> 09:00.414
Think big money.

09:00.498 --> 09:01.999
Ooh, when we were in Vegas,

09:02.083 --> 09:03.834
{\an1}who was raking in
all the dough?

09:03.918 --> 09:06.337
- The prostitutes?

09:07.755 --> 09:10.675
- No, Stamps,
the casinos!

09:10.758 --> 09:12.802
{\an1}We could have
a casino night.

09:12.885 --> 09:14.637
{\an1}Get a couple
of craps tables,

09:14.720 --> 09:16.389
ooh, play some blackjack.

09:16.472 --> 09:18.724
- A few prostitutes.

09:18.808 --> 09:20.559
- No prostitutes, Stamps.

09:20.643 --> 09:22.186
This is gonna be classy.

09:22.270 --> 09:24.272
{\an1}We're gonna raise
a ton of money for Boyce,

09:24.355 --> 09:25.815
and the best part is,

09:25.898 --> 09:28.442
{\an3}Alicia won't have
a damn thing to do with it.

09:28.526 --> 09:30.486
{\an1}- Yeah,
I've had enough of her,

09:30.569 --> 09:32.822
{\an1}talkin' about,
"Stamps, it is illegal

09:32.905 --> 09:36.325
{\an1}to use voter registration
to get girls' phone numbers."

09:36.409 --> 09:38.202
- Yes, and she's telling me,

09:38.286 --> 09:41.664
"Lolli, Boyce can't talk
to anyone who's already

09:41.747 --> 09:43.749
a member of his church."

09:43.833 --> 09:44.750
{\an1}- Haha!

09:44.834 --> 09:46.544
{\an1}Yeah, and she's all,
"Stamps,

09:46.627 --> 09:48.671
{\an1}"if you submit
these forms to the state,

09:48.754 --> 09:51.007
{\an1}"you could go to federal prison
for 25 years.

09:51.090 --> 09:54.719
{\an1}Why are you laughing?
This is a real possibility!"

09:54.802 --> 09:57.054
- She is so annoying!
- Yeah.

09:57.138 --> 09:59.724
{\an3}- And you might
be going to jail.

10:01.851 --> 10:03.394
Good afternoon, everyone.

10:03.477 --> 10:04.395
{\an3}- Hi, babe.

10:04.478 --> 10:05.855
- We can't stay.

10:05.938 --> 10:08.733
{\an1}We just came to drop off
these invitations.

10:08.816 --> 10:11.777
{\an1}Our super PAC
is having a fund raiser.

10:11.861 --> 10:13.612
- I'm sorry.
Your what?

10:13.696 --> 10:15.740
- Our super PAC!

10:15.823 --> 10:17.074
Oh, I'm sorry.

10:17.158 --> 10:18.701
You didn't know?
[gasps]

10:18.784 --> 10:20.911
What a faux pas.

10:20.995 --> 10:22.872
- Actually, it was my idea.

10:22.955 --> 10:24.123
{\an3}I thought that
since Saxby has one,

10:24.206 --> 10:26.250
{\an3}this would be a good thing
for Lolli to take on.

10:26.334 --> 10:28.461
- You see, Alicia,

10:28.544 --> 10:31.422
this way, we can
circumvent fund-raising limits

10:31.505 --> 10:36.218
while funneling soft money
directly into advertising.

10:36.302 --> 10:39.180
{\an1}- That's what
a super PAC does.

10:39.263 --> 10:40.806
- Yes, I know.

10:40.890 --> 10:43.684
- You know now.

10:43.768 --> 10:46.187
{\an3}- Oh, a casino night.
Babe, this should be fun.

10:46.270 --> 10:47.938
- Yeah, Boyce,
what we're gonna do--

10:48.022 --> 10:49.440
- I'm sorry, Lolli.

10:49.523 --> 10:52.276
I'm going to have to ask
you and Stamps to leave.

10:52.360 --> 10:54.445
- I know you ain't telling me
I've got to leave

10:54.528 --> 10:56.030
<i>my</i> husband's office.

10:56.113 --> 10:57.323
{\an3}- Okay, uh, Lolli,
calm down.

10:57.406 --> 10:59.617
{\an3}Keep your earrings on,
baby.

10:59.700 --> 11:02.078
{\an1}- It's illegal for officers
of the super PAC

11:02.161 --> 11:04.246
{\an1}to be in the candidate's
headquarters.

11:04.330 --> 11:08.459
- Well, let me
tell <i> you</i> something...

11:08.542 --> 11:11.045
I didn't know that.

11:11.128 --> 11:14.882
See you on Friday.
Cocktail attire, please.

11:14.965 --> 11:16.926
- And no prostitutes.

11:19.178 --> 11:23.015
{\an1}- "Citizens for
a Saintlier St. Louis."

11:23.099 --> 11:24.350
{\an1}Oh, boy.

11:24.433 --> 11:25.893
{\an3}- Look, there is nothing
to worry about.

11:25.976 --> 11:27.937
{\an3}If there's one thing
Lolli knows how to do,

11:28.020 --> 11:29.438
that is throw a party.

11:29.522 --> 11:32.316
{\an1}- A political fund raiser
isn't like a church bake sale.

11:32.400 --> 11:33.984
It has to be perfect.

11:34.068 --> 11:36.112
{\an1}Guest list.
Image. Message.

11:36.195 --> 11:38.989
{\an1}For instance,
are there any vegans attending?

11:39.073 --> 11:40.282
- I don't know.

11:40.366 --> 11:41.200
- Well, I hope Lolli does,

11:41.283 --> 11:43.119
{\an1}because what you call
a crab cake,

11:43.202 --> 11:45.413
{\an1}they call
deep-fried murder.

11:45.496 --> 11:47.456
- I know you're trying
to scare me right now,

11:47.540 --> 11:49.959
but all you're doing
is making me hungry.

11:52.086 --> 11:54.463
[loud chatter,
lively music playing]

11:54.547 --> 11:57.633
both:
Oh. My. God.

12:01.554 --> 12:02.430
{\an3}- Not bad.

12:02.513 --> 12:04.056
- Uh,<i> very</i> not bad.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.182
- Hey!

12:05.266 --> 12:06.976
- Well, hi, babe.

12:07.059 --> 12:08.561
This is incredible.

12:08.644 --> 12:10.312
- I have to admit, Lolli,

12:10.396 --> 12:11.772
I'm impressed.

12:11.856 --> 12:14.692
{\an1}- I'm sorry.
I didn't catch that.

12:14.775 --> 12:18.654
My amazing fund raiser
was drowning you out.

12:18.737 --> 12:19.989
- I need a drink.

12:20.072 --> 12:21.615
- Hmm, I know you do.

12:21.699 --> 12:23.033
- Oh, but, babe...

12:23.117 --> 12:25.828
{\an3}Lolli, really,
you did an amazing job.

12:25.911 --> 12:27.413
{\an3}How did you do this
so quickly?

12:27.496 --> 12:29.039
- Well, Stamps did help.

12:29.123 --> 12:30.958
{\an1}I mean, he got the tables
and the dealers,

12:31.041 --> 12:32.918
{\an1}the equipment, the DJ,
and the liquor,

12:33.002 --> 12:35.796
but it was mostly me.

12:35.880 --> 12:37.256
{\an3}- Well, I'm proud of you,
babe.

12:37.339 --> 12:39.550
{\an3}Oh, I see a space
at the craps table.

12:39.633 --> 12:43.012
{\an3}I'm gonna go rub some elbows
with donors, all right?

12:43.095 --> 12:43.846
Take the house down.

12:43.929 --> 12:46.140
- Boyce, you <i> are</i> the house.

12:47.850 --> 12:50.227
{\an3}- So are you registered
to vote?

12:50.311 --> 12:52.688
{\an3}And if so,
will you be voting as single,

12:52.771 --> 12:56.025
{\an3}married, or,
"It's complicated"?

12:56.108 --> 12:57.193
- Stamps...
- Hmm?

12:57.276 --> 12:59.528
{\an3}- Alicia is enjoying
our party,

12:59.612 --> 13:01.030
and it's killing her!

13:01.113 --> 13:02.615
- Yes!
[both laugh]

13:02.698 --> 13:04.033
{\an1}Oh, and since
she's the campaign

13:04.116 --> 13:06.035
and we're the PAC,
no one can tell me

13:06.118 --> 13:09.163
{\an1}I'm not allowed to hit on
potential voters.

13:09.246 --> 13:11.457
{\an3}- You can't hit on
potential voters, Stamps.

13:11.540 --> 13:13.209
{\an1}- Why?

13:13.292 --> 13:14.627
- Because I said so.

13:14.710 --> 13:16.545
{\an3}Look, I'm proud of you,
though.

13:16.629 --> 13:17.630
Look at this place.

13:17.713 --> 13:19.006
{\an3}I thought
I was gonna get here

13:19.089 --> 13:21.175
{\an3}and you'd have
two folding tables,

13:21.258 --> 13:23.886
{\an3}a deck of cards,
and Skittles for poker chips.

13:23.969 --> 13:25.888
- Lolli, I know what I'm doing.

13:25.971 --> 13:27.056
- Okay.

13:27.139 --> 13:28.224
{\an3}- Stamps.

13:28.307 --> 13:30.267
- All right, Lolli,
this is Mr. Leonard.

13:30.351 --> 13:31.894
He came all the way
from Atlantic City

13:31.977 --> 13:33.646
{\an1}to donate
this casino equipment.

13:33.729 --> 13:35.856
- That's a long way away.

13:35.940 --> 13:37.900
I mean,
that's very nice of you.

13:37.983 --> 13:39.860
{\an3}- Well, I'm a big believer
in karma.

13:39.944 --> 13:41.779
{\an3}You do good things
for people;

13:41.862 --> 13:43.864
{\an3}they do good things
for you.

13:43.948 --> 13:45.616
- Oh, really?

13:45.699 --> 13:48.577
{\an3}- Do I see the future mayor
standing over there?

13:48.661 --> 13:50.913
- [chuckles]
- Stamps...

13:50.996 --> 13:53.290
{\an3}Why would people
from New Jersey be interested

13:53.374 --> 13:55.292
in who the mayor
of St. Louis is?

13:55.376 --> 13:57.336
{\an1}- I know what you're
worried about, but don't be.

13:57.419 --> 13:59.004
{\an1}They just want to expand
their casino

13:59.088 --> 14:01.006
{\an1}and sanitation businesses
here.

14:01.090 --> 14:03.717
{\an3}- That's exactly what
I'm worried about!

14:03.801 --> 14:05.052
{\an3}What did you think
I was worried about?

14:05.135 --> 14:07.596
{\an1}- That they didn't write us
a big fat check,

14:07.680 --> 14:09.765
because they did that too.

14:09.848 --> 14:11.767
- Stamps, this is all bad.

14:11.850 --> 14:13.936
They're trying
to buy off Boyce.

14:14.019 --> 14:15.354
{\an3}- No.
Come on, Lolli.

14:15.437 --> 14:17.606
{\an3}Just because casino owners
from Atlantic City

14:17.690 --> 14:19.942
{\an3}donated a bunch of money
to get Boyce elected--

14:20.025 --> 14:21.902
{\an3}[gasps]
Oh, my God.

14:21.986 --> 14:24.697
{\an3}We just sold Boyce
to the mob.

14:25.698 --> 14:27.741
[laughter]

14:30.744 --> 14:32.079
- All right, here we go,
everybody.

14:32.162 --> 14:33.664
Hard six.
Six the hard way, baby.

14:33.747 --> 14:35.457
all: Oh!

14:35.541 --> 14:38.335
{\an1}- Nicely done!
I knew you were a smart bet.

14:38.419 --> 14:40.879
{\an1}When we move into town,
call me anytime.

14:40.963 --> 14:43.257
{\an1}I'll be sure
to take care of you.

14:43.340 --> 14:45.301
{\an3}- Thank you.
Are you a doctor?

14:45.384 --> 14:47.511
{\an1}- [laughs]

14:47.595 --> 14:49.972
{\an1}- Stamps, we've got to
do something about this.

14:50.055 --> 14:51.974
- Okay, I'll tell Alicia.

14:52.057 --> 14:53.642
{\an1}- What?
No, no, no, no, no.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.352
You will not.

14:55.436 --> 14:56.604
{\an3}We can't give her
the satisfaction of knowing

14:56.687 --> 14:58.814
that me and you screwed up.

14:58.897 --> 15:00.983
Well, mostly you.

15:01.066 --> 15:03.235
{\an3}Look, we gotta get Boyce
out of here

15:03.319 --> 15:04.695
and keep Alicia
from finding out

15:04.778 --> 15:05.362
who those guys are.

15:05.446 --> 15:07.406
{\an3}Oh, my God.

15:07.489 --> 15:09.450
Hey, girlfriend!

15:09.533 --> 15:12.411
[laughs nervously]
How you doin'?

15:12.494 --> 15:14.079
{\an3}- You know, I didn't care
for the name,

15:14.163 --> 15:16.707
{\an3}but this Boyce-tini
is delicious.

15:16.790 --> 15:18.751
- You know
what you should try?

15:18.834 --> 15:20.961
The Long Island
Boyce'd Tea.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.338
- Who is Boyce talking to?

15:22.421 --> 15:24.506
{\an3}I thought I knew
all the big donors in town.

15:24.590 --> 15:25.799
I should go meet them.

15:25.883 --> 15:28.010
- Don't you ever
take a night off?

15:28.093 --> 15:30.846
I got two words for you:
Rou. Lette.

15:30.929 --> 15:32.264
Huh?
Heh, come on!

15:32.348 --> 15:34.224
- No, I don't gamble.

15:34.308 --> 15:35.517
{\an1}- Oh, this is my jam.
Yeah.

15:35.601 --> 15:36.685
Come on, dance with me.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.020
- Oh, no.
- Dance with me.

15:38.103 --> 15:40.230
Yeah, you got it.
- I-I can't--

15:40.314 --> 15:42.024
- Go, dice!

15:42.107 --> 15:43.525
[cheering and applause]

15:43.609 --> 15:46.028
{\an1}- Look at this.
I'm already winning with you.

15:46.111 --> 15:47.196
This is the start

15:47.279 --> 15:48.697
{\an1}of a beautiful
working relationship.

15:48.781 --> 15:51.033
- Uh, just to be clear,

15:51.116 --> 15:53.869
{\an3}I already have a doctor
that I like.

15:53.952 --> 15:57.122
{\an3}- Boyce, I need you
to take me home.

15:57.206 --> 16:00.125
{\an3}I've had way too many
Boyce and Tonics.

16:00.209 --> 16:02.127
{\an1}- What are you talking about,
babe? We just got here.

16:02.211 --> 16:04.213
{\an1}Plus, I'm on
a bit of a lucky streak.

16:04.296 --> 16:06.215
- I don't think you are.

16:06.298 --> 16:07.466
{\an1}- Come on, let me
introduce you to my friends.

16:07.549 --> 16:11.804
- Oh, great--
- Boyce, you're taking me home.

16:11.887 --> 16:12.888
- Lolli, what is going on?

16:12.971 --> 16:14.223
- Oh, hey.
Oh, whoa, whoa.

16:14.306 --> 16:16.183
Where are you going?
- Oh, sorry, Lolli.

16:16.266 --> 16:18.727
She broke through
my cabbage patch.

16:18.811 --> 16:19.937
- We're leaving.

16:20.020 --> 16:21.230
- Wait, you can't leave.

16:21.313 --> 16:22.231
This is your fund raiser.

16:22.314 --> 16:24.858
- Thank you.
- Boyce, drive me home.

16:24.942 --> 16:27.903
Drive your drunk wife home!

16:27.986 --> 16:30.572
{\an3}- Stamps, would you drive Lolli
home for me, all right?

16:30.656 --> 16:33.158
{\an3}Lolli, baby, I'm sorry,
but there is still

16:33.242 --> 16:36.412
{\an3}a mob of people
I haven't even met yet.

16:36.495 --> 16:39.248
- Alicia, it pains me
to admit this,

16:39.331 --> 16:40.499
especially to you,

16:40.582 --> 16:42.292
{\an1}but those money guys
you don't know--

16:42.376 --> 16:43.919
{\an3}I'm pretty sure
they're from

16:44.002 --> 16:45.462
a New Jersey crime family.

16:45.546 --> 16:47.506
{\an3}- Wha--

16:47.589 --> 16:49.758
{\an3}well, that explains
the pinky rings.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.343
- Okay, Lolli,
I know that was

16:51.427 --> 16:53.429
hard for you to admit,
but I appreciate it.

16:53.512 --> 16:57.099
Luckily, my years of political
experience have prepared me,

16:57.182 --> 17:01.228
and I know exactly what to do
in this situation.

17:01.311 --> 17:04.397
[alarm blaring]
Out the back door!

17:04.481 --> 17:06.316
Now!

17:07.859 --> 17:10.570
- I'm sorry, Boyce.

17:10.654 --> 17:13.949
{\an3}That's not the party
I wanted it to be.

17:14.031 --> 17:15.284
- It's okay, babe.

17:15.367 --> 17:16.993
I'm just glad
we got out of there

17:17.077 --> 17:18.287
before Mr. Leonard

17:18.369 --> 17:20.289
kissed me on the lips again.

17:20.372 --> 17:24.334
{\an3}- I just wanted to be a part
of your campaign so badly.

17:24.417 --> 17:27.003
{\an1}- Well, congrats.
You're doing it so badly.

17:27.087 --> 17:28.630
- All right, enough.

17:28.714 --> 17:31.300
Alicia, this campaign
isn't about you.

17:31.383 --> 17:33.469
- Ha! In your face!

17:33.552 --> 17:35.971
- And it's not about you
either, Lolli.

17:36.054 --> 17:37.598
This campaign is about me

17:37.681 --> 17:39.808
trying to help the people
of St. Louis,

17:39.892 --> 17:41.185
and I can't do that

17:41.268 --> 17:42.561
if I spend all my time
refereeing you two.

17:42.644 --> 17:45.647
{\an3}So you're gonna have to
both learn to work it out

17:45.731 --> 17:47.316
and work together.

17:47.399 --> 17:49.401
- Boyce, you're right.

17:49.485 --> 17:52.154
Alicia, I owe you an apology.

17:52.237 --> 17:54.239
{\an3}You are killing yourself
to get Boyce elected.

17:54.323 --> 17:57.117
{\an3}You work long hours,
seven days a week.

17:57.201 --> 17:59.828
{\an3}It's clear you don't even
have time to get your hair done

17:59.912 --> 18:02.539
or buy cute clothes.

18:02.623 --> 18:04.750
- Okay, well,
I'm sorry too.

18:04.833 --> 18:06.710
{\an1}When I took this job,
I didn't realize

18:06.794 --> 18:08.921
{\an1}you would be
such an assertive, dominating...

18:09.004 --> 18:12.341
{\an1}presence,
who would insist

18:12.424 --> 18:13.842
{\an1}on controlling
every single aspect

18:13.926 --> 18:15.677
of her husband's campaign.

18:15.761 --> 18:19.306
- Apology accepted.

18:19.389 --> 18:22.684
- Okay, well, that's progress,
I think.

18:22.768 --> 18:24.853
So friends?

18:24.937 --> 18:26.313
- Eh.
- Well...

18:26.396 --> 18:28.023
- I-I mean,
just work friends.

18:28.106 --> 18:29.525
- A little strong.
- Eh...

18:29.608 --> 18:31.485
- Okay, colleagues
who can work together

18:31.568 --> 18:33.028
without killing each other.

18:33.111 --> 18:35.155
- Maybe.
- Possible.

18:35.239 --> 18:36.740
- Good enough for me.

18:39.201 --> 18:41.870
{\an1}- Well, Alicia
underestimated us.

18:41.954 --> 18:44.206
But even with your mistakes...

18:44.289 --> 18:45.707
- Our mistakes.

18:45.791 --> 18:48.544
- We made $18,000.

18:48.627 --> 18:49.711
both: [laughing]

18:49.795 --> 18:53.423
Get it. Get it. Get it.
Get it. Get it. Get it.

18:53.507 --> 18:55.134
{\an3}- You know what got everybody
to open their wallets?

18:55.217 --> 18:57.553
- Huh?
- It's our top-shelf bar.

18:57.636 --> 19:00.806
{\an1}- Ooh-ah!
I did not include that.

19:00.889 --> 19:01.890
{\an1}Hold on.

19:01.974 --> 19:06.311
{\an1}Okay, we still made
$16,000 and some change.

19:06.395 --> 19:07.896
- Hey, not too shabby.

19:07.980 --> 19:09.106
- Not at all!

19:09.189 --> 19:11.024
both:
Get it. Get it. Get it.

19:11.108 --> 19:13.569
- Wait, did you pay the DJ?

19:13.652 --> 19:16.738
{\an1}- No, I thought you paid the DJ.
He's your boy.

19:16.822 --> 19:19.491
{\an3}- Damn it.

19:19.575 --> 19:20.784
{\an1}- Okay.
We're still okay.

19:20.868 --> 19:22.119
{\an3}- We're better than okay.
We still made bank.

19:22.202 --> 19:25.247
{\an1}- Yeah, and once we get
the deposit back

19:25.330 --> 19:26.582
from the ballroom--

19:26.665 --> 19:27.666
{\an3}- Ooh, you didn't get
that email.

19:27.749 --> 19:30.377
{\an3}Yeah, uh, when we pulled
the fire alarm,

19:30.460 --> 19:32.713
the sprinklers went off
and caused water damage.

19:32.796 --> 19:35.007
So we actually owe them.

19:35.090 --> 19:37.968
{\an1}- I see.

19:38.051 --> 19:39.720
So where are we, Stamps?

19:39.803 --> 19:43.515
{\an3}- Well, um,
including everything,

19:43.599 --> 19:46.101
we are $3,000 in the black.

19:46.184 --> 19:48.145
{\an1}- Okay, well,
that's not bad.

19:48.228 --> 19:51.148
{\an3}- No, wait.
Black is the good one?

19:51.231 --> 19:53.275
{\an3}Well, then,
we $3,000 in the red.
