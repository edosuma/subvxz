WEBVTT

02:12.089 --> 02:13.466
Back off, creeps.

02:47.416 --> 02:48.876
Batgirl...

02:49.919 --> 02:51.045
Are you all right?

02:51.962 --> 02:53.130
Yes.

02:55.216 --> 02:56.717
Thanks to you.

03:05.434 --> 03:06.686
<i>Barbara!</i>

03:07.311 --> 03:09.063
<i>Hey, Babs!</i>

03:11.065 --> 03:13.609
Yo, bookworm! You up there?

03:14.985 --> 03:16.278
What is it, Dick?

03:16.362 --> 03:18.322
All work and no play, you know?

03:18.572 --> 03:20.199
Come on, let's do a pizza run.

03:20.282 --> 03:21.784
Love to, but I can't.

03:22.243 --> 03:25.371
If I don't ace these midterms,
Dad says he'll throw me in jail.

03:25.621 --> 03:28.124
And with my dad, that's no idle threat.

03:31.877 --> 03:33.504
Okay, catch you later.

03:35.589 --> 03:37.341
Math.

03:37.758 --> 03:39.677
Why did it have to be math?

03:53.983 --> 03:57.069
Hmm. Maybe I should take a break.

04:21.427 --> 04:23.179
Catwoman, I presume.

04:34.273 --> 04:37.276
Well, well.
Look what the bat dragged in.

04:37.359 --> 04:39.111
Give up. I've caught you.

04:39.361 --> 04:40.905
Caught me? At what?

04:41.030 --> 04:42.948
Returning to the scene of your crime.

04:44.116 --> 04:46.243
Look... Batgirl, is it?

04:46.827 --> 04:49.830
I'm just trying to find out
who took the jade-cat statue.

04:50.164 --> 04:52.958
It's an art treasure.
It belongs to the world.

04:53.292 --> 04:55.461
Right. Pull the other one.

04:55.628 --> 04:56.754
Look.

04:58.005 --> 04:59.131
Huh?

05:00.633 --> 05:03.093
Looks like the alarm cord
was eaten through with acid

05:03.177 --> 05:05.763
like the locks on the skylight. So?

05:06.889 --> 05:08.307
That's not my style.

05:08.599 --> 05:09.767
No finesse.

05:13.562 --> 05:14.814
See?

05:15.022 --> 05:16.065
Okay.

05:16.607 --> 05:18.859
If you're innocent, come down
to police headquarters with me

05:18.943 --> 05:20.402
and tell them your story.

05:20.486 --> 05:23.030
That's also not my style.

05:25.449 --> 05:28.202
One way or another,
you're coming with me.

05:28.702 --> 05:31.831
Bats are just mice with wings,
little girl.

05:34.083 --> 05:35.125
Robin!

05:35.751 --> 05:37.628
Just came to investigate the robbery.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.797
I didn't expect a convention.

05:48.806 --> 05:51.892
- Come on! She's getting away.
- Robin, wait! She's not...

05:58.858 --> 06:00.776
Here, kitty, kitty.

06:04.572 --> 06:06.240
Bye-bye, birdie.

06:08.534 --> 06:09.618
Hey!

06:14.373 --> 06:17.167
We'll talk again, soon.

06:19.628 --> 06:21.630
Well, you were a lot of help.

06:21.755 --> 06:24.842
I tried to tell you
she didn't steal the jade cat.

06:25.092 --> 06:26.427
How do you know that?

06:26.760 --> 06:28.888
Ijust know, that's all.

06:29.054 --> 06:31.098
Oh, well, thank you, Ms. Psychic.

06:31.432 --> 06:33.267
And you call yourself a crime-fighter.

06:33.350 --> 06:36.020
If you'd listened
instead ofjust barging in-

06:36.145 --> 06:38.147
Just don't get in my way again, okay?

06:45.154 --> 06:46.447
Dork.

06:54.914 --> 06:57.041
- That was a great class.
- You said it.

06:57.124 --> 06:58.834
Let's go get a soda.

07:25.611 --> 07:27.196
Got the note, I see.

07:31.825 --> 07:33.702
If this is a trick, Catwoman-

07:33.786 --> 07:34.954
No trick.

07:35.120 --> 07:38.290
I just wanted to tell you
how impressed I was with you last night.

07:40.125 --> 07:42.127
You're smart, and you're fast.

07:43.087 --> 07:45.089
I thought
maybe you'd like to work together.

07:45.714 --> 07:47.925
After all, against the two of us,

07:48.008 --> 07:50.511
whoever took the jade cat
doesn't stand a chance.

07:53.013 --> 07:55.265
Okay. On one condition.

07:55.766 --> 07:57.893
If you're lying to me and I find out,

07:58.018 --> 07:59.478
you'll give yourself up.

08:02.022 --> 08:03.023
Deal.

08:15.285 --> 08:19.206
So, you won't be back in time to help me
look for your old flame Catwoman?

08:19.289 --> 08:21.041
Sorry, Dick. You're on your own.

08:21.125 --> 08:24.211
This WayneCorp merger is vital
for the European common market.

08:24.294 --> 08:25.796
Okay, sure.

08:25.879 --> 08:29.174
After all, who needs you
when I've got Batgirl to help me?

08:29.508 --> 08:32.678
Watch out for Selina.
She likes to play mind games.

08:34.805 --> 08:37.307
I hope Batgirl isn't in over her head.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.227
The Stacked Deck?

08:40.436 --> 08:42.855
That's the sleaziest dive
in Gotham City.

08:42.938 --> 08:44.064
Exactly.

08:44.148 --> 08:47.568
The only place to find information
on the jade cat job.

08:47.943 --> 08:49.361
You're not afraid, are you?

08:51.238 --> 08:53.907
No. Of course not. Let's go.

08:54.533 --> 08:56.410
The mouse has guts.

09:20.601 --> 09:21.977
- Hey!
- Here, kitty!

09:22.061 --> 09:23.353
- Oh, my!
- Kitty, kitty!

09:23.437 --> 09:27.775
Hey, kitten, how's about spending
one of your nine lives with me?

09:27.858 --> 09:29.985
Crawl back in your litter box, creep.

09:36.909 --> 09:38.911
Anyone else wanna get fresh?

09:40.621 --> 09:42.039
You stay.

09:43.123 --> 09:45.918
I got nothing to say to you, lady.

09:54.426 --> 09:58.263
Didn't anyone ever tell you
it's impolite to walk out on a lady?

09:58.347 --> 10:00.099
This is from the jade cat job.

10:00.182 --> 10:02.726
Residue of the acid used on the locks.

10:02.935 --> 10:05.062
That's nice. Why tell me?

10:05.145 --> 10:06.980
They call you "The Chemist."

10:07.231 --> 10:10.943
You know every acid, explosive
and poison by its first name.

10:11.151 --> 10:12.820
Any idea where this was made?

10:13.028 --> 10:14.404
Hmm.

10:14.613 --> 10:16.990
Basic corrosive compound.

10:17.116 --> 10:22.538
Probably a local manufacturer,
like Axis, Phoenix, or...

10:24.665 --> 10:25.999
Hey!

10:45.811 --> 10:47.396
Was this part of your plan?

10:47.479 --> 10:48.772
It is now.

10:57.990 --> 10:59.783
I think it's closing time.

11:08.834 --> 11:09.877
Hey!

11:31.398 --> 11:34.151
This is unit seven, in pursuit
of Catwoman and Batgirl.

11:34.234 --> 11:37.154
Oh, Daddy, if you could see
your little girl now.

11:51.043 --> 11:52.920
- Hang on!
- I am!

12:02.262 --> 12:03.931
You could've gotten us killed.

12:04.097 --> 12:05.224
But I didn't.

12:05.307 --> 12:08.518
All that, and we didn't even get
the information we were looking for.

12:08.602 --> 12:09.895
Sure we did.

12:09.978 --> 12:13.398
You saw the way the chemist freaked
when he recognized that acid.

12:13.482 --> 12:16.777
I'm willing to bet only
one guy in Gotham makes it.

12:16.944 --> 12:18.737
An old friend of mine.

12:26.912 --> 12:28.080
<i>This is unit seven.</i>

12:28.163 --> 12:31.333
<i>We lost Catwoman and Batgirl
on the Bayshore Expressway.</i>

12:31.500 --> 12:33.168
What the heck is she up to?

12:42.135 --> 12:45.722
Hey, I recognize this place
from crime reports.

12:45.806 --> 12:47.641
It used to belong to Roland Daggett.

12:47.724 --> 12:49.685
This is where he invented
the Renuyu drug

12:49.768 --> 12:52.062
that turned Matt Hagen into Clayface.

12:56.608 --> 12:59.111
You do know your police cases.

12:59.903 --> 13:02.239
This is also where
Daggett developed a virus

13:02.322 --> 13:04.366
that nearly killed me and my cat.

13:22.926 --> 13:24.136
Aw-

13:24.386 --> 13:26.471
It's nice to be right.

13:28.515 --> 13:30.934
Yes, isn't it?

13:31.643 --> 13:34.980
Selina Kyle,
how pleasant to see you again.

13:35.314 --> 13:37.607
The pleasure is all yours, Daggett.

13:37.691 --> 13:39.067
We'll be leaving now.

13:39.151 --> 13:40.944
On the contrary, my dear,

13:41.028 --> 13:46.325
you and your lovely young friend here
will be staying forever.

14:02.382 --> 14:04.343
Why take the jade cat, Daggett?

14:04.468 --> 14:06.553
There were other
more valuable treasures.

14:06.720 --> 14:09.139
Because it's exactly
what you would have taken.

14:09.389 --> 14:11.933
Also, I need the money to start over.

14:19.566 --> 14:25.280
My legal fees after my last encounter
with Batman left me broke.

14:25.572 --> 14:26.740
The money from this statuette

14:26.823 --> 14:29.451
will set me up quite nicely
somewhere else

14:29.659 --> 14:34.164
while the cops look
for a certain feline thief.

14:34.456 --> 14:36.083
So, what are you going to do?

14:36.166 --> 14:39.628
Leave us hanging over one of these vats
with acid burning through the rope?

14:41.421 --> 14:43.757
If there's one thing
I've learned over the years,

14:43.840 --> 14:48.887
it's that you crime-fighting types
are very resourceful.

14:49.179 --> 14:53.266
So I'll just have my men shoot you
and throw your bodies into the vats.

14:53.683 --> 14:57.312
There's still enough acid residue
in them to destroy the evidence.

16:00.208 --> 16:01.626
Not bad.

16:01.960 --> 16:03.462
Not bad yourself.

16:03.670 --> 16:04.880
How'd you find us?

16:04.963 --> 16:07.841
Ms. Kitty isn't the only one
with access to a chemical lab.

16:08.133 --> 16:09.509
Where's Catwoman?

16:18.935 --> 16:20.729
Going somewhere, Daggett?

16:22.230 --> 16:23.231
Get away from me!

16:37.370 --> 16:38.955
Nice catch.

17:10.904 --> 17:14.741
Now you know how it feels to look
the Grim Reaper in the eye, Daggett.

17:14.824 --> 17:17.786
The same way I felt
when you pumped me full of your virus.

17:17.869 --> 17:19.079
No!

17:19.454 --> 17:21.957
If you let him fall,
you're no better than he is.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.375
Oh, grow up.

17:39.015 --> 17:40.392
Catwoman, wait!

17:45.647 --> 17:48.066
Relax. You've had a busy day.

18:52.422 --> 18:55.091
You were going to keep that statue
all along, weren't you?

18:55.550 --> 18:56.801
Of course.

18:56.926 --> 19:00.639
Haven't you learned yet that
only the strong survive in this game?

19:03.350 --> 19:04.893
Okay, I admit it.

19:04.976 --> 19:07.395
I was just playing with you at first.

19:07.771 --> 19:09.356
But you really impressed me.

19:09.481 --> 19:11.066
We make a good team.

19:11.358 --> 19:13.485
Together we could pick this town clean.

19:13.568 --> 19:15.904
Even Batman wouldn't be a match for us.

19:15.987 --> 19:19.532
And the cops are a joke,
especially that senile fool Gordon.

19:21.201 --> 19:23.244
We had a deal, remember?

19:23.495 --> 19:24.496
You lost.

19:24.829 --> 19:26.373
Give yourself up now.

19:27.624 --> 19:28.667
Freeze!

19:31.211 --> 19:32.837
Okay. You win.

19:33.296 --> 19:35.298
And by the way, Batgirl's innocent.

19:35.382 --> 19:37.092
She was acting under coercion.

19:47.560 --> 19:49.020
You should've said yes.

19:49.229 --> 19:52.357
If I had, I'd be a rat with wings.

19:57.362 --> 20:00.115
I knew you had Catwoman
on a leash all along.

20:00.281 --> 20:01.991
You're a lousy liar.

20:02.075 --> 20:03.660
But thanks for trying.

20:15.547 --> 20:17.674
- Are you guys all right?
- Yeah.

20:20.051 --> 20:21.761
I said I'd let them take me,

20:21.970 --> 20:24.013
but I didn't say how far.

20:29.644 --> 20:31.020
It's okay.

20:31.479 --> 20:33.148
There'll be another time.

21:09.768 --> 21:10.769
English - SDH
