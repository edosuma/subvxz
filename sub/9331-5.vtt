What the hell is

00:20.020 --> 00:21.922
Oh, I'm sorry.
Did I wake you?

00:21.922 --> 00:23.454
I was trying so hard
to be quiet.

00:25.456 --> 00:26.597
I can't sleep, Sofia.

00:26.597 --> 00:28.159
I'm so upset about Josh.

00:28.159 --> 00:29.960
You said time would
heal all wounds,

00:29.960 --> 00:31.102
but it's not working.

00:32.263 --> 00:33.334
It's been two hours.

00:34.665 --> 00:37.568
Yes, but two hours feels
like forever when...

00:37.568 --> 00:39.240
the guy you like
can't kiss you,

00:39.240 --> 00:41.041

answers, Sofia. Answers!

00:43.474 --> 00:48.849
Hey, maybe the answers
will come to you in a dream.

00:48.849 --> 00:51.252
-Let's find out.
-No!

00:51.252 --> 00:53.284
How am I supposed to
go to work on Monday

00:53.284 --> 00:54.585
and act like nothing happened?

00:54.585 --> 00:56.257
I mean, what am I supposed
to say to him?

00:56.257 --> 00:57.458
How can I even look at him?

00:57.458 --> 00:59.460
Call in sick.

00:59.460 --> 01:01.031
But then I can't see him.

01:02.593 --> 01:05.966
Gabi, we're gonna have to
pace out your angst, okay?

01:05.966 --> 01:07.067
It's Sunday morning.

01:07.067 --> 01:08.399
Early, early Sunday Morning.

01:08.399 --> 01:10.901
We're gonna have so much time
to talk about this.

01:10.901 --> 01:13.804
Yeah, but... but what about
on Wednesday when you and Jake

01:13.804 --> 01:16.607
go to Florida for your cousin's
quinceañera and I'm alone?

01:16.607 --> 01:18.179
Who am I going to
talk to then? Huh?

01:18.179 --> 01:19.350
What am I gonna do then?

01:19.350 --> 01:21.412
I'll just be a FaceTime away.

02:04.225 --> 02:06.357
You girls were just
in here last week.

02:06.357 --> 02:08.559
What's the problem,
broken nail or broken heart?

02:08.559 --> 02:09.860
-Heart.
-Nail.

02:11.232 --> 02:13.764
You think you can squeeze us in

Mija, if I could squeeze

To be happy again.

-It's Josh.
-Oh, here we go.

02:40.391 --> 02:43.664
I mean, we finally get together
and he can't even kiss me.

02:43.664 --> 02:45.336
After a year of waiting?

02:45.336 --> 02:46.797
I don't get it.
(gasps)

02:46.797 --> 02:48.569
Maybe you need a new look.

02:48.569 --> 02:51.141
You know, some highlights,
a blowout,

02:51.141 --> 02:53.274
a gel manicure
with some pinky bling.

02:53.274 --> 02:54.945
We happen to be
having a special.

02:54.945 --> 02:57.147
No, Martina.
All the bling in the world

02:57.147 --> 02:58.909
isn't gonna get Josh over
his commitment issues.

02:58.909 --> 03:00.751
Aye, than I say
forget him.

03:00.751 --> 03:03.554
You know, there are plenty
of other fish in the sea,

03:03.554 --> 03:04.885
and you know how
to catch one?

03:04.885 --> 03:07.218
With some highlights,
a blowout,

03:07.218 --> 03:09.159
a gel manicure
with some pinky bling.

03:09.159 --> 03:10.491
Did I mention
we're having a special?

03:10.491 --> 03:12.763
(both giggle)

03:12.763 --> 03:13.824
Okay, what's going on in there?

03:13.824 --> 03:15.366
Everybody keeps
coming out giggling.

03:15.366 --> 03:16.327
Oh.
(giggles)

03:16.327 --> 03:18.299
I'll tell you why.

03:18.299 --> 03:20.301
We just put in
a spray tanning booth,

03:20.301 --> 03:23.504
and the vent connects to
the therapist office above us,

03:23.504 --> 03:25.506
so now whoever gets a spray tan

03:25.506 --> 03:27.778
can hear every word
of the entire session.

03:27.778 --> 03:30.441
That is a total
invasion of privacy.

03:30.441 --> 03:32.683
-Well, you know...
-I want to hear the details.

03:32.683 --> 03:33.914
(giggles)

03:33.914 --> 03:36.947
So last week I heard
a man who wanted to know

03:36.947 --> 03:38.519
what it feels like
to be a woman.

03:38.519 --> 03:41.151
So, after the session,
I intercepted him

03:41.151 --> 03:43.324
in the stairwell, and do you
know what I offered him?

03:43.324 --> 03:44.995
All:
Some highlights,

03:44.995 --> 03:46.927
a blowout, a gel manicure
with some--

03:46.927 --> 03:48.359
We get it, Martina.

03:48.359 --> 03:51.001
No, no, no, no.
I got it.

03:51.001 --> 03:52.303
Therapy. That's the answer.

03:52.303 --> 03:54.034
Josh should go to
that therapist upstairs

03:54.034 --> 03:55.636
to deal with
his commitment issues.

03:55.636 --> 03:57.438
Well, I think
therapy's a great idea,

03:57.438 --> 03:58.939
but why would you want
him to go to that one?

03:58.939 --> 04:01.512
Then every woman in here
would know about his problems.

04:01.512 --> 04:03.644
Not every woman.

04:03.644 --> 04:05.446
(whispers)
Just this one.

04:13.183 --> 04:14.455
Can someone measure me?

04:14.455 --> 04:16.387
I will! I will!

04:16.387 --> 04:19.360
No, it's my turn!

04:19.360 --> 04:20.991
So what do you need, baby?

04:20.991 --> 04:23.734
need to rent a tux
or Sofia's niece's quinceañera.

04:23.734 --> 04:25.536
Oh! I said it!

04:25.536 --> 04:26.797
Quin-cetar...

04:26.797 --> 04:28.138
Nope. Lost it.

04:28.138 --> 04:29.640
I gotta get this right.

04:29.640 --> 04:31.241
I'm meeting her whole family.

04:31.241 --> 04:32.303
I've been practicing though

04:32.303 --> 04:33.504
with Rosetta Stone
all morning.

04:33.504 --> 04:34.875
Check this out.

04:34.875 --> 04:37.548
Bonsoir, Madame Rodriguez.

04:37.548 --> 04:39.279
(speaking French)

04:39.279 --> 04:41.652
-How's that sound?
-Like French.

04:41.652 --> 04:43.314
(groans)

04:45.486 --> 04:46.717
So I bought Gabi and I this

04:46.717 --> 04:48.459
deluxe couples massage
for tomorrow night,

04:48.459 --> 04:49.560
but after everything
that's happened...

04:49.560 --> 04:50.891
Oh, I'll take it!

04:52.493 --> 04:54.395
Just because you're
as big as two people

04:54.395 --> 04:55.666
doesn't make you a couple.

04:58.529 --> 05:00.030
Fine.

05:00.030 --> 05:01.402
You want it?

05:01.402 --> 05:03.303
Come and get it.

05:05.005 --> 05:06.637
Fine, we'll split it.

05:06.637 --> 05:09.510
I'll leave the tip,
you hand in the coupon.

05:10.541 --> 05:11.882
If you can find it in there.

05:15.616 --> 05:17.117
Hey, is that Gabi?

05:17.117 --> 05:18.549
Do I hear Gabi?
Aye, there she is!

05:20.791 --> 05:22.893
Um, I've been waiting
for you all morning.

05:22.893 --> 05:25.255
Not that I'm complaining.
I mean, why would
I complain in any way?

05:25.255 --> 05:26.757
You're the most awesome,
understanding woman,

05:26.757 --> 05:29.430
nay, person,
I've ever met.

05:30.631 --> 05:31.862
How was your weekend?

05:31.862 --> 05:34.535
Well, after the
you-couldn't-kiss-me incident,

05:34.535 --> 05:36.607
it was sad,
but then it got un-sad

05:36.607 --> 05:38.809
because I figured out a way
to solve our problem,

05:38.809 --> 05:39.910
nay, your problem.

05:41.011 --> 05:42.373
So did I.

05:42.373 --> 05:43.714
So, yesterday I had
the whole day

05:43.714 --> 05:45.075
to think about
my commitment issues,

05:45.075 --> 05:47.448
and how I could fix
said commitment issues.

05:47.448 --> 05:49.550
So, I did a search
for commitment issues.

05:49.550 --> 05:51.281
Here's what I got.

05:51.281 --> 05:52.282
Shwa!

05:53.384 --> 05:55.255
Wow. Impressive.

05:55.255 --> 05:56.256
(scoffs)

05:58.629 --> 05:59.760
Thank you.

06:01.191 --> 06:02.863
Thank you so much for that.

06:04.164 --> 06:05.996

Acknowledgment.

06:07.498 --> 06:09.700

what this shows me?

06:09.700 --> 06:11.472
That you really want
to help yourself.

06:11.472 --> 06:14.274
-I do.
-And I want to
help you help you.

06:14.274 --> 06:17.448
And I have a way
to do that without
all of this pesky reading.

06:17.448 --> 06:19.580
How about a real, live person?

06:19.580 --> 06:21.181

I'm sorry, do you feel like
I overstepped my bounds?

07:15.536 --> 07:17.638
That's great.
You'll have more to talk about.

07:19.910 --> 07:21.311
And talk loud!

07:28.078 --> 07:30.551
Uh, hello, why aren't
your clothes off?

07:30.551 --> 07:33.183
Um, so, do you remember
when I told you

07:33.183 --> 07:35.285
I wanted to treat us both
to some spray tans?

07:35.285 --> 07:36.727
Yeah.

07:36.727 --> 07:39.790
Well, what if instead I treat us
to some light espionage?

07:39.790 --> 07:41.792
-Gabi, you didn't.
-I did.

07:41.792 --> 07:43.964
Josh is about to walk in
for his appointment
any second.

07:43.964 --> 07:46.236
Gabi, not only is this
totally wrong,

07:46.236 --> 07:47.598
but it's bordering on illegal.

07:47.598 --> 07:49.500
What? I did it for you!

07:49.500 --> 07:51.642
Me? What are you talking about?

07:51.642 --> 07:53.774
Well, if I came here by myself,

07:53.774 --> 07:55.305
I would hear all of this
horrible information

07:55.305 --> 07:57.207
and then I would come home,
possibly in tears,

07:57.207 --> 07:58.709
and you would be like,
"What's wrong, Gabi?"

07:58.709 --> 08:00.380
and I would tell you,
and you would be like,

08:00.380 --> 08:01.982
"Well, are you sure
you heard him correctly?"

08:01.982 --> 08:03.784
and then I'd be like,
"Well, I'm pretty sure."

08:03.784 --> 08:06.156
Now you can
be totally sure. See?

08:06.156 --> 08:08.158
Gabi, I don't want
any part in this.

08:08.158 --> 08:09.620
Voice 1:
Come in, Mr. Kaminski.

08:09.620 --> 08:11.261
(gasps)
It's happening!

08:11.261 --> 08:13.493
So, what brings
you here today?

08:13.493 --> 08:15.666
Voice 2:
Well, I keep having
this recurring dream

08:15.666 --> 08:18.228
where my girlfriend is
smothering me with a pillow.

08:18.228 --> 08:20.000
-Oh, he thinks
I'm smothering him?
-That's ridiculous.

08:20.000 --> 08:22.402
-Do you believe I have to
stand here and listen to this?
-Shh! Shh!

08:22.402 --> 08:24.334
Sounds like a classic
anxiety dream,

08:24.334 --> 08:26.777
and it may signify
deeper intimacy issues.

08:26.777 --> 08:28.909
So how do I fix it?

08:28.909 --> 08:31.011
Yeah, and how long
is it gonna take?

08:31.011 --> 08:33.744
Well, these issues usually
start in childhood.

08:33.744 --> 08:36.046
Sometimes it takes
people years to resolve.

08:36.046 --> 08:38.148
"Years"? Are you kidding me?

08:38.148 --> 08:39.650
-That's not lickety-split!
-Shh!

08:41.121 --> 08:43.293
Hey, are you two listening
to a new patient?

08:43.293 --> 08:45.495
You want some popcorn and soda?
I'm having a special.

08:51.662 --> 08:53.734
Oh, my God.

08:55.836 --> 08:58.669
That was 90 minutes
of pure bliss.

08:58.669 --> 08:59.970
Elliot, Yolanda.

08:59.970 --> 09:02.112
It's important to hydrate.

09:02.112 --> 09:05.075
Oh, honey,
I just got a peek
under Elliot's robe.

09:05.075 --> 09:07.017
You can keep the water.
I need whiskey.

09:09.650 --> 09:11.682
But I thought you two
were a couple.

09:11.682 --> 09:13.353
(chuckles)
A couple of employees

09:13.353 --> 09:15.656
using our boss's appointment.

09:15.656 --> 09:17.027
Plus, I like guys.

09:17.027 --> 09:18.428
She likes fries.

09:20.260 --> 09:21.762
Oh.

09:21.762 --> 09:23.694
In that case, here's my card.

09:23.694 --> 09:25.866
Call me anytime.

09:25.866 --> 09:27.397
To book another massage?

09:27.397 --> 09:29.940
Yeah, that too.

09:29.940 --> 09:31.301
-(chuckles)
-Okay.

09:31.301 --> 09:33.844
Well, we've got to
get back to work.

09:33.844 --> 09:35.706
Thank you for comin'.

09:35.706 --> 09:36.847
-Bye!
-Yeah.

09:36.847 --> 09:38.108
-(door closes)
-What the hell was that?

09:38.108 --> 09:39.610
What the hell was what?

09:39.610 --> 09:42.813
(scoffs)
That man was clearly
flirting with you,

09:42.813 --> 09:44.554
and instead of telling him
you were married,

09:44.554 --> 09:45.886
you started giggling
like a white girl

09:45.886 --> 09:48.358
that just got a free
pumpkin spice latte.

09:50.891 --> 09:52.422
Oh, stop it.

09:52.422 --> 09:54.865
He's just looking
for repeat business.

09:54.865 --> 09:56.727
You really think he's into me?

09:56.727 --> 09:58.729
Yes, and trust me,

09:58.729 --> 10:01.231
this is a slippery slope
to infidelity.

10:01.231 --> 10:03.974
First you're giggling,
then you're flirting, then bam!

10:03.974 --> 10:06.737
You're screwing the dog walker
on my grandma's futon!

10:09.279 --> 10:11.712
Yolanda, I'm not
your ex-husband.

10:11.712 --> 10:13.944
-I'd never cheat on Alan.
-Hm...

10:13.944 --> 10:15.615
then you won't mind
if I do this.

10:19.489 --> 10:21.351
You ever hear
of the Internet, bitch?

10:27.728 --> 10:29.229
(knocking)

10:32.903 --> 10:35.105
Sofia, you don't have to
check up on me, okay?

10:35.105 --> 10:37.467
I haven't said
one single thing to Josh.

10:37.467 --> 10:38.969
-You haven't seen
him yet, have you?
-No.

10:40.771 --> 10:43.674
Well, I'm not here to
check up on you anyway.

10:43.674 --> 10:45.115
Jake and I are leaving
for Florida tomorrow,

10:45.115 --> 10:46.677
so I just want to make sure
that everything's good

10:46.677 --> 10:49.880
with his tu--
Oh, my God.

10:51.481 --> 10:54.054
Isn't it crazy how different
our lives are right now?

10:55.385 --> 10:56.656
I love this tux.

10:56.656 --> 10:57.828
I'mma start
renting all my clothes.

10:59.760 --> 11:01.491
Oh, I love it too.

11:01.491 --> 11:02.763
You look like my prom date,

11:02.763 --> 11:05.696
except you're tall, gorgeous,
and not my cousin.

11:07.968 --> 11:08.739
Morning, everybody.

11:08.739 --> 11:10.971
Ugh, there he is.

11:10.971 --> 11:12.402
Keep it together.

11:12.402 --> 11:14.374
Sofia, I'm not stupid, okay?

11:14.374 --> 11:15.505
I'm not gonna bring it up.

11:15.505 --> 11:16.707
Hi, Josh.
How was therapy?

11:20.250 --> 11:22.382
-Okay, so here's the thing--
-I know the thing!

11:22.382 --> 11:23.754
Okay? I know everything!

11:23.754 --> 11:25.085
I know about
your smother dreams

11:25.085 --> 11:26.456
and your intimacy issues,

11:26.456 --> 11:28.188
and all the years
it's gonna take

11:28.188 --> 11:30.420
for you to heal
your stupid inner child!

11:30.420 --> 11:32.793
Well, guess what, buddy?

11:32.793 --> 11:36.096
I'm not waiting years
for you to figure out your crap.

11:36.096 --> 11:38.698
I have no idea
what you're talking about.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.270
Oh, save it, Josh.

11:40.270 --> 11:42.032
The therapist I sent you to
is right above my nail salon.

11:42.032 --> 11:45.105
I heard everything.
All your sick little issues.

11:46.536 --> 11:49.239
Well, you definitely
heard someone's issues,

11:49.239 --> 11:50.741
but they weren't mine.

11:50.741 --> 11:53.213
Oh, please. I heard him
say "Mr. Kaminski".

11:53.213 --> 11:54.915
How do you explain that?

11:54.915 --> 11:56.346
(slurps loudly)

11:59.920 --> 12:02.122
It... it was me.

12:02.122 --> 12:04.024
-What?
-Oh, my God.

12:04.024 --> 12:06.296
Josh gave me his appointment.

12:07.858 --> 12:10.761
Wow. I am so happy
you're not my boyfriend.

12:19.609 --> 12:21.041
I don't understand.

12:21.041 --> 12:23.113
You're the Kaminski
who feels smothered?

12:23.113 --> 12:24.344
Yeah, I--

12:24.344 --> 12:26.947
I didn't even know I had
that problem until yesterday.

12:28.018 --> 12:29.479
You think I'm smothering you?

12:29.479 --> 12:31.822
No, not you. Life.

12:31.822 --> 12:32.953
And you.

12:35.025 --> 12:36.186
It's so weird.

12:36.186 --> 12:38.829
I was having
all these crazy dreams,

12:38.829 --> 12:40.991
which I mentioned to Josh,
so he gave me

12:40.991 --> 12:43.263
the therapy appointment
that Gabi gave him,

12:43.263 --> 12:45.235
which helped me
work everything out,

12:45.235 --> 12:46.867
and I feel so much better.

12:46.867 --> 12:49.900
Last night, I finally
had my normal dream:

12:49.900 --> 12:52.202
just flying around.

12:55.045 --> 12:57.407
So, what you're saying is that

12:57.407 --> 12:59.609
you have Gabi to thank
for all of this.

12:59.609 --> 13:01.481
Jake:
Yeah!

13:01.481 --> 13:03.083
Thanks, Gabs!

13:03.083 --> 13:05.755
Yeah, thanks, Gabs.

13:05.755 --> 13:08.688
Sofia, I'm-- I'm sorry.

13:08.688 --> 13:11.892
You're an amazing girl,
but I'm just not ready
to settle down.

13:11.892 --> 13:14.194
I gotta move.
I gotta travel the world.

13:14.194 --> 13:16.126
o, start after the quinceañera.

13:16.126 --> 13:17.767
-Sofia--
-No, seriously!

13:17.767 --> 13:18.798
You-- you have to go.

13:18.798 --> 13:20.130
I already told
my whole family about you.

13:20.130 --> 13:21.731
I even sent them pictures,

13:21.731 --> 13:23.133
which they thought
were just photos

13:23.133 --> 13:25.005
from a magazine
like last time.

13:26.937 --> 13:28.238
I promise I'm not
gonna smother you!

13:28.238 --> 13:31.041
Please, please, please,
please, please, please, please!

13:31.041 --> 13:33.383
Sofia, I was always gonna
go to the quiche-etera.

13:34.885 --> 13:37.747
I wasn't going to break up
with you till after.

13:37.747 --> 13:38.919
Oh.

13:38.919 --> 13:40.550
That's so sweet.

13:44.124 --> 13:45.395
Pre-breakup sex?

13:45.395 --> 13:46.897
Oh, oui, oui.

13:55.335 --> 13:57.237
So, um...

13:57.237 --> 13:59.509
pancakes or waffles
for breakfast today?

13:59.509 --> 14:01.441
You get to pick
'cause you're m'boss.

14:02.913 --> 14:04.374
-Gabi?
-Yes, m'boss?

14:06.476 --> 14:09.279
You listened in
on a private therapy session?

14:09.279 --> 14:11.621
Yes, but it wasn't
just me, okay?

14:11.621 --> 14:13.253
Sofia was there
and Martina!

14:13.253 --> 14:14.885
You manipulated me!

14:14.885 --> 14:16.957
I know I did,
and I'm so sorry.

14:16.957 --> 14:18.128
But the good news is

14:18.128 --> 14:21.161
you don't think
I'm smothering you.

14:21.161 --> 14:23.533
I...

14:23.533 --> 14:27.137
can't understand
how you don't see
the error of your ways.

14:27.137 --> 14:30.941
I don't understand
how you cannot see

14:30.941 --> 14:33.003
that I was just trying
to help us.

14:33.003 --> 14:34.504
I-- I can't--

14:34.504 --> 14:36.046
I-- I can't even
talk to you right now.

14:36.046 --> 14:38.578
You... you need therapy.

14:38.578 --> 14:40.080
Okay. Maybe I do.

14:40.080 --> 14:42.152
-Maybe we both should go.
-Maybe we should.

14:42.152 --> 14:43.753
Maybe we should just go
to couples therapy.

14:43.753 --> 14:45.385
Oh! So, we're still a couple?

14:53.964 --> 14:55.795
You want me to hold
the elevator for you?

14:55.795 --> 14:56.826
(sighs)

14:56.826 --> 14:59.699
I have so much to do
before I can leave.

14:59.699 --> 15:02.132
-Go on without me.
-Okay.

15:02.132 --> 15:04.304
-See you tomorrow.
-Kay, bye.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.377
(knocking)

15:14.414 --> 15:16.947
-Hi, Nikolai.
-Hey, you.

15:16.947 --> 15:18.148
Why are you still dressed?

15:18.148 --> 15:19.319
(giggles)
Silly.

15:21.221 --> 15:22.552
Why don't you
set up your table

15:22.552 --> 15:24.224
while I go change
in the bathroom?

15:24.224 --> 15:25.195
You got it.

15:27.227 --> 15:29.059
I should have known
that little troll

15:29.059 --> 15:31.701
wouldn't work late
if Josh wasn't here to see him.

15:35.565 --> 15:38.238
What's up, Abercrombie?

15:38.238 --> 15:39.669
Hey, Yolanda.

15:39.669 --> 15:42.272
Ooh! He remembered my name!
(giggles)

15:42.272 --> 15:44.474
Ooh, focus, girl. Focus.

15:44.474 --> 15:46.716
Look here. Here's 100 bucks.

15:46.716 --> 15:48.618
Make yourself scarce.

15:48.618 --> 15:51.982
I gotta lead a miniature horse
to water and pray that
he doesn't drink.

15:53.483 --> 15:55.525
Ready!

15:55.525 --> 15:57.887
Nikolai, I'm ready!

16:06.396 --> 16:08.498
Oh, Nikolai,

16:08.498 --> 16:11.141
my back is so tight.

16:11.141 --> 16:14.044
I want you to undo my knots
like a boy scout.

16:16.476 --> 16:17.907
Ooh!

16:17.907 --> 16:21.111
Sauce me up and work me
like a rib.

16:31.821 --> 16:34.164
(moans)

16:34.164 --> 16:37.027
Oh, Nikolai.

16:37.027 --> 16:39.899
This is even better
than last time.

16:41.131 --> 16:45.175
You have the strong,
masculine grip of a linebacker.

16:48.208 --> 16:52.082
(moans)

16:52.082 --> 16:53.913
Oh, don't stop, Nikolai.

16:56.286 --> 17:01.321
This feels so good.

17:04.554 --> 17:05.795
Oh...

17:05.795 --> 17:07.327
Can I just say--

17:07.327 --> 17:08.198
Oh.

17:11.061 --> 17:12.362
Oh...

17:12.362 --> 17:13.833
Can you do my ears?

17:16.866 --> 17:18.368
(giggles)

17:18.368 --> 17:21.010
(giggles, moans)

17:21.010 --> 17:23.413
(giggles, moans)

17:27.777 --> 17:29.619
Nikolai...

17:29.619 --> 17:34.084
you're moving into
some dangerous territory.

17:34.084 --> 17:35.385
(moans)

17:37.026 --> 17:38.158
Stop!

17:39.559 --> 17:41.231
Nikolai...

17:41.231 --> 17:42.892
I have to say something.

17:42.892 --> 17:44.594
Remember that huge,

17:44.594 --> 17:46.166
horrible woman
you met the other day?

17:49.899 --> 17:51.741
Well, she told me
not to call you,

17:51.741 --> 17:53.543
and it turns out
she was right.

17:53.543 --> 17:55.205
I'm married.

17:55.205 --> 17:57.477
I love my husband very much.

17:58.948 --> 18:01.311
Now I need you to
leave the room

18:01.311 --> 18:04.584
'cause I'm embarrassed to say
you gave me a huge bon--

18:04.584 --> 18:05.755
-Aah!
-Aah!

18:05.755 --> 18:06.886
-(screams)
-(laughs)

18:08.318 --> 18:09.759
-Oh, my God! Aah!
-(laughs)

18:13.062 --> 18:14.424
So over the phone,

18:14.424 --> 18:16.526
Josh told me a little bit
about your relationship.

18:16.526 --> 18:18.568
Oh, so he, uh, told you

18:18.568 --> 18:20.430
what started this whole thing
is the fact that we've been

18:20.430 --> 18:22.172
trying to get together
for, like, a whole year,

18:22.172 --> 18:24.304
and when we finally did
and tried to kiss,

18:24.304 --> 18:26.876
he backed away,
suddenly sickened by me.

18:26.876 --> 18:28.338
I'm sorry, I talk a lot
when I'm nervous,

18:28.338 --> 18:31.181
but you probably figured
that out already because
you're a therapist.

18:31.181 --> 18:32.612
And our time's up.

18:34.144 --> 18:35.715
Is that what brought
you here today?

18:35.715 --> 18:38.248
You'd think, but no.

18:38.248 --> 18:41.090
Go ahead, Gabi.
Tell her what you did.

18:41.090 --> 18:42.352
Well, I was--

18:42.352 --> 18:44.194
She spied on my brother
in a therapy session,

18:44.194 --> 18:45.355
thinking it was me.

18:45.355 --> 18:47.096
Go ahead, Gabi.

18:47.096 --> 18:49.399
-What happened was--
-And then she has the nerve

18:49.399 --> 18:51.431
to turn it around on me
like it's my fault.

18:51.431 --> 18:53.303
-It is your fault.
-Okay.

18:53.303 --> 18:55.635
Sometimes when couples
are having difficulty

18:55.635 --> 18:57.337
seeing the other person's
point of view,

18:57.337 --> 18:58.808
it helps to do
a little role-playing.

18:58.808 --> 19:01.441
Ooh, like I'm a sassy waitress
at a bowling alley?

19:03.072 --> 19:04.174
What I meant was

19:04.174 --> 19:05.575
Gabi, you pretend
to be Josh,

19:05.575 --> 19:07.046
and Josh, you pretend
to be Gabi.

19:07.046 --> 19:08.678
Oh, so you want us
to do a Freaky Friday?

19:08.678 --> 19:10.920
Gabi, professionals
don't call it--

19:10.920 --> 19:12.151
Yes, a Freaky Friday.

19:14.824 --> 19:16.486
Okay. I'll start.

19:19.189 --> 19:21.661
Hi, I'm Gabi.

19:21.661 --> 19:24.294
I am a chef who works
for a brilliant tech millionaire

19:24.294 --> 19:27.136
named Josh, who's working
very hard on fixing
his commitment issues.

19:27.136 --> 19:30.200
Okay, well, I'm Josh,

19:30.200 --> 19:32.141
and that beautiful,
talented chef

19:32.141 --> 19:34.143
I was just talking about,
well I can't believe

19:34.143 --> 19:35.345
you couldn't kiss me.

19:35.345 --> 19:37.307
Her.

19:37.307 --> 19:39.178
Okay. So, Gabi...

19:39.178 --> 19:40.910
Both:
Yes?

19:40.910 --> 19:45.385
Josh-Gabi, why do you think you
spied on Josh's therapy session?

19:45.385 --> 19:46.786
Well...

19:46.786 --> 19:48.758
because I'm childish, immature,

19:48.758 --> 19:50.620
and too impatient to wait
for Josh to get better.

19:50.620 --> 19:52.292
My turn, my turn, my turn.

19:52.292 --> 19:53.823
Josh?

19:53.823 --> 19:55.765
I won't kiss her,
I won't date her,

19:55.765 --> 19:57.327
and I don't know
when I'm gonna be better.

19:57.327 --> 19:59.329
In short, I suck.

20:00.800 --> 20:02.232
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:02.232 --> 20:04.374
Don't be so hard
on yourself, Josh.

20:04.374 --> 20:05.975
Maybe the reason
why you can't commit

20:05.975 --> 20:08.077
is 'cause sometimes
I act very immature.

20:08.077 --> 20:12.211
Well, Gabi, you're just
a 23-year-old girl. I'm 30.

20:12.211 --> 20:14.113
What's my excuse?
You know what?

20:14.113 --> 20:16.386
Maybe we're both too immature
to be together right now.

20:16.386 --> 20:17.717
Maybe what's best
for the two of us

20:17.717 --> 20:19.419
is to stop trying
to be together

20:19.419 --> 20:20.450
until we both grow up!

20:21.991 --> 20:23.523
Wait, did I just
break up with myself?

20:30.530 --> 20:34.304
I can't believe we both
got dumped by Kaminskis.

20:34.304 --> 20:36.766
Well, technically,
I broke up with myself,

20:36.766 --> 20:38.338
but, you know, he agreed.

20:39.439 --> 20:42.141
I went to Disney World
and I still feel sad.

20:42.141 --> 20:44.173
Don't. We're better off
without them.

20:44.173 --> 20:47.417
-Or are we worse off?
-No, we're better.

20:47.417 --> 20:49.719
Josh and his stupid
commitment issues.

20:49.719 --> 20:50.950
Yeah.

20:50.950 --> 20:54.153
Jake and his stupid hands
all over my body late at night.

20:55.385 --> 20:56.926
-Sofia.
-Sorry.

20:56.926 --> 20:59.489
Did I tell you that my abuelita
fell in love with Jake,

20:59.489 --> 21:01.561
so I told her we're engaged?

21:01.561 --> 21:04.494
I only told her that
'cause she's 98.

21:05.735 --> 21:07.537
-Did she tell everybody else?
-Yes.

21:10.800 --> 21:12.802
-Wanna watch a movie?
-No.

21:12.802 --> 21:15.475
-You wanna get a pizza?
-No.

21:16.506 --> 21:18.478
You wanna get spray tans
and listen in on people

21:18.478 --> 21:19.479
who have it way worse than us?

21:19.479 --> 21:21.381
I would like that very much.
