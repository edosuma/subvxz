Well, Mike, let's talk

38:34.479 --> 38:37.148
Your edge over here is sharp.

38:37.148 --> 38:40.527
It lacerated
deep into the bowels right here.

38:40.527 --> 38:43.571
Your spike definitely caved in
all the way through the chest

38:43.571 --> 38:45.281
and straight into the heart.

38:45.281 --> 38:47.367
The only issue we have

38:47.367 --> 38:49.160

on the rounded side.

But you know what?
It is well balanced.

cut deep in the chest cavity
