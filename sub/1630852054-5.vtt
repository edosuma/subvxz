00:23.357 --> 00:25.326
<i>Previously on</i> Ghost...

00:25.359 --> 00:26.627
- Yas, what's up?
<i>When are you coming</i>

00:26.660 --> 00:28.662
- to get me?
<i>Soon. I promise.</i>

00:28.696 --> 00:31.132
We just gotta be strong
together no matter what, okay?

00:31.165 --> 00:32.566
Find out who killed
that professor.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.635
That's how we get Zeke
out from under all this.

00:34.668 --> 00:36.337
You want me to wear a wire?

00:36.370 --> 00:38.806
If you do,
I promise I can get them

00:39.039 --> 00:41.242
to drop any criminal
investigation into you.

00:41.275 --> 00:43.511
<i>Yeah, okay.</i>

00:43.544 --> 00:44.545
This is a new Rollie?

00:44.578 --> 00:45.813
Um... yeah.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.815
I'll be right back, okay?

00:48.048 --> 00:49.784
I hired that attorney
we talked about.

00:49.817 --> 00:51.152
Who? The white dude?

00:51.185 --> 00:53.187
Yeah, Saxe.
Look, he don't know it yet--

00:53.220 --> 00:54.488
he's gonna help me
get you outta here.

00:54.522 --> 00:56.390
Davis MacLean needs
a million dollars by tomorrow

00:56.424 --> 00:57.591
to pay for Zeke's defense.

00:57.625 --> 00:59.093
Absolutely fucking not.

00:59.126 --> 01:00.828
I know you paid Davis
the million dollars today.

01:01.061 --> 01:03.063
What am I 'posed to tell
my husband about another man

01:03.097 --> 01:04.598
paying my nephew's
million-dollar bill?

01:04.632 --> 01:06.100
Maybe tell him
I did what I needed to do

01:06.133 --> 01:07.334
to protect our son.

01:07.368 --> 01:08.436
Go get Ramirez's body.

01:08.469 --> 01:09.703
What if it backs up
on me, Ma?

01:09.737 --> 01:12.239
You made your choice, Cane.
It is what it is.

01:12.273 --> 01:14.475
You help me with this shit,
you'll level up in no time.

01:14.508 --> 01:15.676
<i>What I got to do?</i>

01:19.713 --> 01:21.582
<i>I'll see your bitch ass
tomorrow, B.</i>

01:21.615 --> 01:24.518
And tell Tariq...

01:24.552 --> 01:26.287
I be seeing him too.

01:26.320 --> 01:27.688
The police theory is that

01:27.721 --> 01:31.425
you paid Detective Ramirez
to kill Jabari Reynolds.

01:31.459 --> 01:32.593
This is some bullshit.

01:32.626 --> 01:33.594
<i>Get out of my face with that.</i>

01:33.627 --> 01:35.162
Fuck, Zeke.

01:35.196 --> 01:36.330
Do you think
Zeke actually did it?

01:36.363 --> 01:37.465
Look, I know
he didn't do it, a'ight?

01:37.498 --> 01:39.099
- How do you know?
I gotta go.

01:39.133 --> 01:40.367
<i>This is the DA's office.</i>

01:40.401 --> 01:42.102
They want Zeke
to turn himself in.

Zeke, don't talk to

03:41.221 --> 03:43.691
Inmates will try
and rat you out

03:43.724 --> 03:46.527
to save their own ass, okay?

03:46.560 --> 03:50.364
Just shut up and blend in.

03:51.599 --> 03:53.968
<i>We'll go in the back,
avoid the press.</i>

04:00.441 --> 04:03.777
Zeke, every moment
you're in there,

04:03.811 --> 04:08.349
know I'm doing everything in
my power to get you out, okay?

04:08.382 --> 04:13.854
I don't think you have
much control over this, Monet.

04:15.289 --> 04:17.758
It's too late for all that.

05:04.805 --> 05:07.074
Yo, I gotta go.
I'ma see you in class.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.810
Wait. Hold on, just a second.
I'm almost done.

05:21.822 --> 05:23.023
Good morning.

05:23.057 --> 05:25.893
My client is here
to voluntarily turn himself in.

05:25.926 --> 05:27.728
Detective Whitman
is expecting us.

05:27.761 --> 05:29.763
Who's your client--

05:31.598 --> 05:32.800
Where's he going?

05:32.833 --> 05:35.936
I thought
they was expecting us.

05:35.969 --> 05:39.640
Jenny, what are you
doing here so bright and early?

05:39.673 --> 05:42.109
Didn't think the ADA needed to
come out for a routine arrest,

05:42.342 --> 05:43.777
especially when my client
is innocent.

05:43.811 --> 05:45.946
Yes, well,
that's why I'm here.

05:45.979 --> 05:47.414
We won't be needing Mr. Cross

05:47.448 --> 05:49.349
to turn himself in anymore,
as it turns out.

05:49.383 --> 05:52.453
Oh, well, one more time,
Jenny, slowly?

05:52.486 --> 05:54.455
- I'm free to go?
- You are free to go, Mr. Cross.

05:54.488 --> 05:58.058
Then I think my client
deserves some answers at least.

05:58.092 --> 06:00.828
- What changed since last night?
- Zeke is no longer a suspect.

06:00.861 --> 06:02.563
There's been
some new developments.

06:02.596 --> 06:03.964
We won't be holding
Mr. Cross at this time.

06:03.997 --> 06:05.766
I'm sure your client
doesn't wanna be

06:05.799 --> 06:07.401
in this precinct
any longer than he has to be.

06:07.434 --> 06:09.002
Well, you heard her. Let's go.

06:09.036 --> 06:13.073
I expect a full press briefing
to clear my client today.

06:13.107 --> 06:16.143
I'll see what I can do.
Let me walk you out.

06:25.652 --> 06:28.555
See, I told you it was
nothing to worry about.

06:28.589 --> 06:30.724
I knew they was gonna
find you innocent all along.

06:30.758 --> 06:32.459
Don't change
that I'm radioactive

06:32.493 --> 06:34.394
after that interview.

06:34.428 --> 06:36.530
I might be free,
but I'm still fucked.

06:36.563 --> 06:38.499
Who's gonna wanna draft me now?

06:38.532 --> 06:40.834
Look, let me give you
a ride back to school.

06:40.868 --> 06:42.736
Once this gets out
and the teams find out

06:42.770 --> 06:44.538
that you're cleared, you'll be
back in the conversations.

06:44.571 --> 06:46.473
I'm sure of that.

06:49.076 --> 06:50.677
You cut me off back there.

06:50.711 --> 06:52.045
That was to keep you
from telling that kid

06:52.079 --> 06:53.547
something he could take back
to his accomplice.

06:53.580 --> 06:54.715
You're like
a fucking broken record.

06:54.748 --> 06:56.517
How long is he gon'
be your suspect?

06:56.550 --> 06:58.752
Ramirez and Reynolds both
were killed with the same gun.

06:58.786 --> 06:59.987
Ramirez's gun.

07:00.020 --> 07:01.789
If Zeke was gonna
commit a crime,

07:01.822 --> 07:04.625
why would he give you
Ramirez's PBA card?

07:04.658 --> 07:06.560
He gave you the connection.

07:06.593 --> 07:07.594
But it was still a connection.

07:07.628 --> 07:08.962
The body that exonerates Cross

07:08.996 --> 07:10.164
just mysteriously
shows up the day after

07:10.197 --> 07:11.565
he shits his pants
on national TV.

07:11.598 --> 07:12.833
You don't find
that fucking fishy?

07:12.866 --> 07:14.701
No, 'cause Zeke
is not our only lead.

07:14.735 --> 07:15.903
I've been reading
Jabari Reynolds' novel.

07:15.936 --> 07:17.504
- His fucking novel?
- Yes.

07:17.538 --> 07:19.006
- C'mon.
- A few of the locations

07:19.039 --> 07:20.140
in the book matches up

07:20.174 --> 07:21.875
to some of the Stansfield
landmarks.

07:21.909 --> 07:22.876
- So what?
- Listen!

07:22.910 --> 07:24.211
Are you gonna let me speak?

07:24.444 --> 07:26.880
'Cause I do my job well.

07:26.914 --> 07:28.849
Go ahead.

07:28.882 --> 07:30.717
Reynolds' first novel--

07:30.751 --> 07:32.553
it was inspired
by actual events.

07:32.586 --> 07:34.955
His new book is about
some serious drug activity

07:34.988 --> 07:36.957
that takes place on a campus

07:36.990 --> 07:38.859
that more than resembles
Stansfield.

07:38.892 --> 07:40.861
What if he got himself
into somethin'

07:40.894 --> 07:42.629
that's not so fictional?

07:47.668 --> 07:49.636
Yo, what's up with you?
You good?

07:50.871 --> 07:53.674
Yeah, just a--
a little hung over.

07:53.707 --> 07:55.509
But we gotta talk
later though.

07:55.542 --> 07:57.144
Heard about some dorm sweeps
for drugs.

07:57.177 --> 07:59.913
Some of our customers
got pulled in.

08:02.049 --> 08:03.650
Tariq, did you hear me?

08:03.684 --> 08:06.253
Some of our customers
got pulled in by the cops.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.255
Yeah, um... like you said,

08:08.488 --> 08:09.890
we'll talk about
that shit later.

08:09.923 --> 08:12.059
Right now we need to focus on
clearing everything outta here

08:12.092 --> 08:14.728
and put everything
on the roof for now, okay?

08:14.761 --> 08:16.930
Hey, yo, um, Cane--
he come around here

08:16.964 --> 08:20.267
asking for me or looking for me
or anything like that?

08:20.500 --> 08:22.102
No, why? What's going on?

08:22.135 --> 08:23.604
Any of the Tejadas come around

08:23.637 --> 08:25.172
asking where I am
or anything like that,

08:25.205 --> 08:27.007
you don't know shit, okay?

08:27.040 --> 08:28.976
Okay, yeah.
I-is everything good?

08:29.009 --> 08:30.143
I'ma figure out.

08:30.177 --> 08:31.745
Just stay away from Cane
and text me

08:31.778 --> 08:33.814
if any of them come over here.

08:42.923 --> 08:44.825
Mrs. Tejada.
I was actually gonna call you.

08:44.858 --> 08:46.193
I've been making real headway.

08:46.226 --> 08:48.061
Bitch,
that's not why I called.

08:48.095 --> 08:49.630
The cops know
Zeke didn't do it,

08:49.663 --> 08:52.699
so whatever you doin',
stop right now--it's done.

08:52.733 --> 08:54.534
Did they find a new suspect?

08:54.568 --> 08:56.203
<i>That's not
your problem or mine.</i>

08:56.236 --> 08:57.571
<i>They let him go.</i>

08:57.604 --> 08:59.106
That's all
the fuck that matters.

08:59.139 --> 09:00.307
You know, you're the reason

09:00.540 --> 09:01.842
why he's in this shit
in the first place.

09:01.875 --> 09:03.577
<i>I don't ever wanna
see your face again.</i>

09:03.610 --> 09:04.978
<i>I don't wanna
hear your name.</i>

09:05.012 --> 09:07.147
You stay the fuck
away from Zeke.

09:07.180 --> 09:09.182
You stay away from me.
You keep your job.

09:09.216 --> 09:11.018
<i>You don't know me,
I don't know you,</i>

09:11.051 --> 09:14.554
and you don't know Zeke...
got it?

09:14.588 --> 09:16.323
Yes. I-I understand.

09:22.229 --> 09:24.231
Detectives,
what are you doing here?

09:24.264 --> 09:26.700
We could use your help.

09:26.733 --> 09:28.735
I think I've helped enough.

09:28.769 --> 09:30.737
We don't have a right to ask,

09:30.771 --> 09:33.273
but if you'd be willing
to help us at this time...

09:33.307 --> 09:34.608
I don't think so.

09:34.641 --> 09:36.677
You said it to me
you were law enforcement.

09:36.710 --> 09:37.978
You took a oath.

09:38.011 --> 09:41.048
Don't you wanna know
who killed Professor Reynolds?

09:41.081 --> 09:43.350
We have the manuscript
he was workin' on.

09:43.583 --> 09:46.253
All Whitman and I are asking
for you to do is read it.

10:00.634 --> 10:02.135
Why did you wanna meet here?

10:02.169 --> 10:03.971
Because I don't
trust myself around you

10:04.004 --> 10:06.206
and those hotel rooms of yours.

10:06.239 --> 10:07.975
And I need to talk
to you about Zeke.

10:08.008 --> 10:09.776
I thought you turned him in
this morning.

10:09.810 --> 10:11.278
We went to the precinct.

10:11.311 --> 10:13.213
They told us they have
some recent developments,

10:13.246 --> 10:14.681
and they didn't
want Zeke anymore.

10:14.715 --> 10:16.016
So I took him back to school.

10:16.049 --> 10:17.651
Did you have
anything to do with

10:17.684 --> 10:19.353
these recent developments,
Monet?

10:19.386 --> 10:21.321
I handled the situation
without your money.

10:21.355 --> 10:23.790
We don't need to fight
together anymore, Dante.

10:23.824 --> 10:24.958
There's nothing to fight.

10:24.992 --> 10:26.293
Ha. Wait a minute.

10:26.326 --> 10:28.295
I'm pretty sure I was
the solution for a hot second.

10:28.328 --> 10:30.197
Please don't make me out
to be the problem.

10:30.230 --> 10:31.898
Look, it's not you.
It's me.

10:31.932 --> 10:33.900
I been making
some really big mistakes lately

10:33.934 --> 10:35.635
like leaving our son
down at the precinct

10:35.669 --> 10:37.337
while I'm off playing
princess with you.

10:37.371 --> 10:39.406
- Hmm.
<i>-I gotta get back to reality</i>

10:39.639 --> 10:40.907
<i>and face my responsibilities</i>

10:40.941 --> 10:43.110
and stop all this
fairytale bullshit.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.078
Okay.

10:45.112 --> 10:47.247
But go back for how long.
and...

10:47.280 --> 10:49.750
I'm sorry,
but to what reality?

10:49.783 --> 10:51.685
<i>I mean, your husband
may be inside,</i>

10:51.718 --> 10:53.286
but you are clearly
still in the life.

10:53.320 --> 10:54.955
Those clothes you got on
didn't come from the bar

10:54.988 --> 10:56.857
- that we're standing in.
- I got a plan to get out,

10:56.890 --> 10:57.991
and it won't take long.

10:58.025 --> 11:00.861
I am trying to give you
a choice, Monet.

11:00.894 --> 11:02.396
<i>You didn't have one
when you left Zeke</i>

11:02.429 --> 11:03.897
<i>or when your husband went in,</i>

11:03.930 --> 11:06.800
but what if you could
decide what you want?

11:09.703 --> 11:11.438
These aren't filed... yet.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.674
I could set up your kids
with trust funds.

11:14.708 --> 11:16.376
All your kids, not just Zeke.

11:16.410 --> 11:19.880
And maybe then you could
choose the life you want.

11:20.981 --> 11:22.249
Choose the man you want

11:22.282 --> 11:25.252
instead of spending the life
you have running around

11:25.285 --> 11:27.854
trying to keep your world
from falling apart.

11:27.888 --> 11:29.823
Because that is not a life.

11:29.856 --> 11:31.691
That is a ticking time bomb.

11:34.027 --> 11:35.929
<i>All you gotta do...</i>

11:37.264 --> 11:39.132
... is sign.

11:43.837 --> 11:45.972
Look, I don't need
a redo, Dante.

11:46.006 --> 11:47.974
I know how to make
my own decisions,

11:48.008 --> 11:49.342
and I'm not 16.

11:49.376 --> 11:52.412
I know you're not 16 anymore.
Neither am I.

11:54.214 --> 11:56.883
This--stop.

11:56.917 --> 12:01.121
This is too much.
You're too much right now.

12:01.154 --> 12:03.023
Just go, please.

12:05.258 --> 12:07.127
You know, you almost
lost Zeke this time, Nae-Nae.

12:07.160 --> 12:08.962
How much do you wanna lose

12:08.995 --> 12:11.731
before you make
a better choice?

12:11.765 --> 12:12.999
You know,
I'm not leaving New York

12:13.033 --> 12:14.301
until you leave with me.

12:14.334 --> 12:16.336
I know you think you got this,

12:16.369 --> 12:18.205
but you can't handle this
by yourself.

12:25.445 --> 12:26.746
Fuck.

12:29.349 --> 12:31.518
Okay, what the hell
happened to you this morning?

12:31.751 --> 12:33.019
You just disappeared.

12:33.053 --> 12:34.221
I know. I'm sorry.

12:34.254 --> 12:36.423
I... I forgot I had to
make an appointment.

12:38.091 --> 12:40.127
I need to get an apartment
so I can get my sister.

12:40.160 --> 12:41.461
There's a hearing tomorrow.

12:41.495 --> 12:43.430
Tomorrow?

12:43.463 --> 12:45.866
Okay, that's really fast.
Do you need help?

12:45.899 --> 12:48.168
No, It's fine.
You don't have to.

12:48.201 --> 12:50.837
I know. I want to.

12:51.538 --> 12:54.007
A'ight. Thank you.

12:54.941 --> 12:56.042
All right!

13:02.549 --> 13:03.884
Karma?

13:03.917 --> 13:07.020
Uh, that wasn't in
last night's reading.

13:07.053 --> 13:08.788
I know. I thought I'd keep
everyone on their toes.

13:08.822 --> 13:10.223
<i>But isn't this</i>

13:10.257 --> 13:12.025
- more theological than ethical?
- Perhaps.

13:12.058 --> 13:13.460
Who can define karma for me?

13:13.493 --> 13:15.929
Karma's the belief
in certain Indian religions

13:15.962 --> 13:17.964
that our actions, good or bad,
can affect our future lives.

13:17.998 --> 13:20.500
And why would that be
important in ethical discourse?

13:20.534 --> 13:22.969
Tariq, enlighten us.

13:23.870 --> 13:26.506
Well, it provides, you know,
incentive for moral action.

13:26.540 --> 13:28.241
Karma is the law
of cause and effect.

13:28.275 --> 13:29.476
<i>Exactly.
You know, I was just thinking</i>

13:29.509 --> 13:31.178
- how interesting--
<i>I think you can</i>

13:31.211 --> 13:32.946
dig deeper, Tariq.

13:32.979 --> 13:34.247
Karma's
basically if you do dirt,

13:34.281 --> 13:35.448
then you get it right back.

13:35.482 --> 13:37.250
<i>Yeah, and then--</i>
- Please.

13:37.284 --> 13:40.120
I am interested
in Tariq's perspective.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.355
Professor, I'm not sure
what you're looking for.

13:42.389 --> 13:44.491
And neither do I,
Professor Milgram. What's...

13:44.524 --> 13:48.261
Karma means you cannot
escape your sins

13:48.295 --> 13:50.997
no matter how fast
or far you may run.

13:51.031 --> 13:53.200
They'll always catch up to you.

13:53.233 --> 13:55.101
Don't you agree, Tariq?

13:58.038 --> 14:00.307
<i>Seems like
Professor Milgram</i>

14:00.340 --> 14:02.042
had a point
to prove with you today.

14:02.075 --> 14:03.843
Yeah, I don't know what
that was about.

14:03.877 --> 14:05.278
- That shit was weird.

14:05.312 --> 14:07.614
You wanna go back to
your spot and grab your stuff?

14:07.847 --> 14:09.382
I can grab my car.

14:09.416 --> 14:12.419
Nah, it's-it's fine.
We can go straight there.

14:12.452 --> 14:13.853
<i>Wait.</i>

14:13.887 --> 14:15.288
<i>Isn't that Zeke?</i>

14:15.322 --> 14:17.857
I'm surprised he didn't get
arrested after that interview.

14:17.891 --> 14:19.993
- Yeah, you know...
<i>Tariq.</i>

14:21.228 --> 14:23.129
Come here.

14:23.163 --> 14:24.931
I was looking for you.

14:24.965 --> 14:27.067
- Who's that?
- That's Zeke's aunt.

14:27.100 --> 14:28.935
She probably here to talk to me
about his tutoring and shit

14:28.969 --> 14:30.937
now that he's back.

14:30.971 --> 14:32.339
I gotta go, all right?

14:32.372 --> 14:34.541
Wait, what about the apartment?

14:34.574 --> 14:37.010
It's fine.
I'ma call you later.

14:38.478 --> 14:40.914
Let's take a drive.

14:48.655 --> 14:50.490
What was the first thing
I said to you

14:50.523 --> 14:52.392
when we got
into business together?

14:52.425 --> 14:54.160
That this doesn't touch Zeke.

14:54.194 --> 14:55.495
I'm glad you remember.

14:55.528 --> 14:58.031
<i>So you wanna tell me
why, of all people,</i>

14:58.064 --> 14:59.266
<i>I had to hear from Cane</i>

14:59.299 --> 15:00.900
that you was the one
that shot the professor

15:00.934 --> 15:02.168
they was looking at Zeke for?

15:02.202 --> 15:04.471
- See, look it's not like that.
- Really?

15:04.504 --> 15:06.439
Tell me
what it's like, Tariq.

15:06.473 --> 15:08.408
Look, I don't know
what Cane told you,

15:08.441 --> 15:10.577
but that Professor Reynolds
nigga, he knew way too much.

15:10.610 --> 15:12.412
<i>He figured out
all this shit about GTG</i>

15:12.445 --> 15:13.980
<i>once that nigga died
in the pool.</i>

15:14.014 --> 15:16.182
Cane heard him say Dru's name,
lost it and shot him.

15:16.216 --> 15:17.617
I just cleaned up the mess.

15:17.651 --> 15:19.085
I asked you right
to your face

15:19.119 --> 15:20.453
did you know anything about
that murder,

15:20.487 --> 15:22.088
and you lied to me.

15:22.122 --> 15:23.657
You and Cane was gonna let Zeke
hang for that shit.

15:23.690 --> 15:25.692
No, I wasn't lettin'
Zeke hang for nothing.

15:25.925 --> 15:27.160
I was the one
that got Davis MacLean

15:27.193 --> 15:28.228
involved with this shit.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.297
Yeah, you can say
whatever you want now,

15:30.330 --> 15:32.165
but how I'ma know
if you lyin' again?

15:45.478 --> 15:48.114
Look, Monet, my plan
was supposed to work, kay?

15:48.148 --> 15:50.083
Ramirez was supposed to
take the fall for that shit.

15:50.116 --> 15:51.985
I didn't know about Zeke
and my professor.

15:52.018 --> 15:54.087
<i>I had no idea the police
would even look into Zeke.</i>

15:54.120 --> 15:55.388
If they ain't let Zeke go,

15:55.422 --> 15:57.257
you'd be looking
at a bullet right now.

15:57.290 --> 16:00.360
I should still shoot your ass
for wasting my time.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.497
But we need each other.

16:05.999 --> 16:07.334
So if we gonna get past this,

16:07.367 --> 16:09.569
I'ma need you to earn
my respect back right now.

16:09.602 --> 16:11.371
I'll do anything.

16:11.404 --> 16:14.007
I need you to find out
who Cane's connect is.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.009
<i>Get me a name,</i>

16:16.042 --> 16:17.444
and I'll let this go.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.513
And if Cane finds out
what you doing,

16:20.547 --> 16:23.383
I'ma know you two
were up to some shit...

16:23.416 --> 16:25.585
and the gun won't stay
on my lap next time.

16:25.618 --> 16:27.253
You feel me?

16:28.455 --> 16:30.423
Now, find your way back.

16:56.616 --> 16:58.351
The book is about
Tariq St. Patrick.

16:58.385 --> 16:59.519
It's a one-to-one.

16:59.552 --> 17:00.587
<i>Listen, if it's a one-to-one,</i>

17:00.620 --> 17:02.155
doesn't that make
Zeke the main character?

17:02.188 --> 17:04.157
I mean, he's the one fucking
the professor in the book.

17:04.190 --> 17:06.393
No. Jabari thought
I was sleeping with Tariq.

17:06.426 --> 17:09.396
Jabari's drug dealer character
is Tariq--I'm sure of it.

17:09.429 --> 17:11.398
St. Patrick's father
was rumored to be

17:11.431 --> 17:12.665
- a major player in the game.
- Look, the details

17:12.699 --> 17:14.234
of the book--they don't match.

17:14.267 --> 17:15.235
All the interviews
of the other kids

17:15.268 --> 17:16.336
who got picked up
in the sting--

17:16.369 --> 17:17.737
they all said the campus
dealer was white.

17:17.771 --> 17:20.273
Well, what if he was working
with his roommate, Brayden?

17:20.306 --> 17:21.441
<i>Brayden Weston?</i>

17:21.474 --> 17:22.809
Why would that kid
need to sell drugs?

17:23.042 --> 17:24.744
And even if this
St. Patrick is selling drugs,

17:24.778 --> 17:26.379
why would he kill Reynolds?

17:26.413 --> 17:29.416
He doesn't have motive like
some other students might have.

17:29.449 --> 17:31.618
Well, if Jabari got
close to proving it was Tariq,

17:31.651 --> 17:34.654
maybe Tariq found out,
wanted to shut him up.

17:34.687 --> 17:36.222
No, then not only
would we have to connect

17:36.256 --> 17:37.524
St. Patrick to the drugs,

17:37.557 --> 17:38.725
we'd have to prove
he knew about the book.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.427
You got any evidence for that?

17:40.460 --> 17:42.462
Isn't that your job?

17:42.495 --> 17:44.564
<i>Gotta get somethin'
on the wire.</i>

17:44.597 --> 17:45.832
The wire is key.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.634
That's how we connect
this kid to the operation.

17:47.667 --> 17:50.470
That's if it turns up
something solid.

17:52.372 --> 17:54.407
Tariq admitted everything
you said today,

17:54.441 --> 17:58.077
but I can't just shut my
business down without a plan.

17:58.111 --> 18:00.480
Wait, so you ain't
gon' do shit to him?

18:00.513 --> 18:02.115
I shoulda got rid
of both of your asses

18:02.148 --> 18:03.416
for what you did,

18:03.450 --> 18:05.118
but I'm giving you a chance
for coming clean

18:05.151 --> 18:07.187
and because y'all connect.

18:07.220 --> 18:08.788
So if I'ma keep you around,

18:08.822 --> 18:11.324
you gotta prove to me that
this'll never happen again.

18:11.357 --> 18:14.661
Tariq or no Tariq,
I need to trust you.

18:14.694 --> 18:16.095
You can trust me, Ma.

18:16.129 --> 18:17.263
Good.

18:17.297 --> 18:19.499
I need to find out
Tariq's weaknesses.

18:19.532 --> 18:21.501
He lied to me
because he's comfortable.

18:21.534 --> 18:23.136
He's not afraid.

18:23.169 --> 18:25.238
I need to know
what will hurt him.

18:25.271 --> 18:26.840
If I can control him,

18:26.873 --> 18:28.641
this type a shit'll
never happen again.

18:28.675 --> 18:31.344
Can I trust you to find out?

18:31.377 --> 18:32.545
I got you.

18:32.579 --> 18:34.647
Good.

18:39.252 --> 18:40.753
Lauren, I was just
about to email you.

18:40.787 --> 18:42.422
Look, Professor Milgram.

18:43.423 --> 18:45.725
I don't think I can
wear this wire anymore.

18:47.227 --> 18:49.462
I don't think
that's possible at this point.

18:49.496 --> 18:50.797
What?

18:50.830 --> 18:54.300
Lauren, I'm gonna
tell you something

18:54.334 --> 18:55.835
that I shouldn't,

18:55.869 --> 18:57.570
and it stays in this room,
okay?

18:57.604 --> 18:58.671
Okay.

18:59.739 --> 19:01.407
Some of the other students
from the sting

19:01.441 --> 19:04.844
identified a preppy white kid
as the drug supplier.

19:04.878 --> 19:06.746
The cops think
it's Brayden Weston.

19:06.779 --> 19:09.482
Wait, Brayden?
Okay, so then what about

19:09.516 --> 19:10.550
- Tariq?
- Tariq?

19:10.583 --> 19:12.352
They don't think
Tariq was involved.

19:14.187 --> 19:15.822
Okay, well, you said
these drugs were tied up

19:15.855 --> 19:17.624
into Professor Reynolds'
murder.

19:17.657 --> 19:19.526
So you think Braden
got him killed?

19:19.559 --> 19:21.828
Well, maybe not intentionally.

19:21.861 --> 19:23.796
Jabari was looking into
the drugs operation

19:23.830 --> 19:25.398
for his new book.

19:25.431 --> 19:28.167
If Brayden found out,
maybe he told the wrong person.

19:28.201 --> 19:29.168
I mean...

19:29.202 --> 19:31.604
That's crazy.

19:31.638 --> 19:33.373
Brayden seems harmless.

19:33.406 --> 19:35.742
I have to tell Tariq
to stay away from him.

19:35.775 --> 19:37.443
I don't want him
to get in trouble.

19:37.477 --> 19:39.379
- No.
- Yes, I have to.

19:39.412 --> 19:42.181
If you do that
and he tells Brayden,

19:42.215 --> 19:44.250
you would be
in a lot of trouble,

19:44.284 --> 19:46.586
and Tariq would be
your accomplice.

19:46.619 --> 19:50.323
You can protect Tariq
by getting more info on Brayden

19:50.356 --> 19:52.258
and everything he knows
onto the wire.

19:52.292 --> 19:55.428
<i>If the police find out what
Brayden thought Jabari knew,</i>

19:55.461 --> 19:58.398
it will really help them
figure out what happened.

20:00.633 --> 20:02.802
- I don't know.
<i>-Lauren,</i>

20:02.835 --> 20:04.871
the faster you do this,

20:04.904 --> 20:06.906
the faster you lose the wire,

20:06.940 --> 20:09.442
and you and Tariq
will be free and clear.

20:10.810 --> 20:12.378
It's up to you.

20:12.412 --> 20:14.814
I know you'll make
the right choice.

20:21.220 --> 20:23.356
Hey, you might wanna
give it a minute, my guy.

20:23.389 --> 20:25.291
Bro, you gotta stop
showing up like that.

20:25.325 --> 20:26.759
<i>Listen, man, you ain't
been answering my texts.</i>

20:26.793 --> 20:27.994
So I figured
I'd just pull up on you,

20:28.227 --> 20:29.796
see where you been at myself.

20:29.829 --> 20:31.598
You ain't been gettin' nervous
about last night, have you?

20:31.631 --> 20:33.499
No, I just had class.
I'm cool.

20:33.533 --> 20:37.003
Good, good. Tariq still
ain't hit me back yet.

20:37.236 --> 20:38.738
I'm gettin' real tired
of coming to this campus

20:38.771 --> 20:41.374
lookin' for him.
Where's he at?

20:41.407 --> 20:42.809
Honestly, I have no idea.

20:42.842 --> 20:44.444
I haven't talked to him
since yesterday.

20:44.477 --> 20:45.845
Maybe with his girl?

20:45.878 --> 20:48.448
- Huh.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.886
Lauren, funny seeing you here.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.888
Your room's just down
the hall now.

20:56.856 --> 20:59.459
- Is Tariq here?
- He, uh--

20:59.492 --> 21:00.893
Tariq's pretty popular.

21:01.894 --> 21:03.830
How you doin', light skin?

21:03.863 --> 21:06.265
Who's your friend, Brayden?

21:06.299 --> 21:07.300
I'm Lorenzo.

21:07.333 --> 21:08.768
Why, you lookin'
for a new friend?

21:08.801 --> 21:10.703
No, I'm not.

21:10.737 --> 21:12.338
And how do you know Tariq?

21:12.372 --> 21:14.641
I don't, but he knows
my cousin Z.

21:14.674 --> 21:16.943
Oh, yeah, I just saw Tariq
talking with Zeke's aunt.

21:16.976 --> 21:18.544
That's your mom?

21:18.578 --> 21:19.746
Yeah. You know where they went?

21:19.779 --> 21:20.913
No, I don't,
I'm sorry.

21:20.947 --> 21:22.548
But he should be back soon

21:22.582 --> 21:24.817
'cause we're supposed to be
looking for apartments so...

21:24.851 --> 21:26.486
Oh, he's looking
for an apartment.

21:26.519 --> 21:28.821
- He's moving.
- Hey, Lorenzo, um...

21:28.855 --> 21:31.858
you know, I was gonna go to
lunch, maybe grab a burger.

21:31.891 --> 21:34.027
It's on me. I'm paying,
and then if we see Tariq,

21:34.060 --> 21:35.628
we'll just let you know.

21:35.662 --> 21:37.463
No, how 'bout you just
give me your digits,

21:37.497 --> 21:39.632
and I call you
if I see the nigga?

21:40.900 --> 21:42.035
Thanks, Brayden.

21:42.068 --> 21:43.302
Of course.

21:47.507 --> 21:49.575
What the fuck?

21:53.780 --> 21:56.749
Mr. St. Patrick.
What brings you here?

21:56.783 --> 21:58.918
My sister's custody hearing
is tomorrow.

21:58.951 --> 22:00.953
Estelle pushed forward,
and I need you to represent me.

22:00.987 --> 22:02.455
- I can pay.

22:02.488 --> 22:04.724
I can't do that.

22:04.757 --> 22:05.892
I can't
do that.

22:05.925 --> 22:07.527
I filed that complaint
with the court

22:07.560 --> 22:08.695
on Yasmine's behalf

22:08.728 --> 22:10.329
because your grandmother
was misusing funds,

22:10.363 --> 22:12.398
but I'm an impartial party.

22:12.432 --> 22:15.702
My sole job is to represent
your father's estate.

22:15.735 --> 22:17.470
Okay, so isn't making
sure his daughter's safe

22:17.503 --> 22:18.705
part of that interest?

22:18.738 --> 22:20.606
If my dad asked you
to take care of his kids,

22:20.640 --> 22:21.774
isn't this part of it?

22:21.808 --> 22:23.476
Yes, but Tariq,

22:23.509 --> 22:26.679
you are too young
to be someone's guardian.

22:26.713 --> 22:30.083
Look, I just wanna take
care of my sister, all right?

22:30.116 --> 22:31.818
You know how much
she's been through?

22:31.851 --> 22:33.586
This is the only way.

22:36.656 --> 22:39.425
All right, I'll represent you,
but solely on the basis

22:39.459 --> 22:41.728
of your grandmother's
misapplication of funds.

22:41.761 --> 22:44.797
Besides that, I'm not
stepping over any lines.

22:44.831 --> 22:46.933
So if you can
completely fulfill

22:46.966 --> 22:50.403
all the requirements
for custody by tomorrow,

22:50.436 --> 22:52.972
I'll give my positive
recommendation to the court.

22:53.005 --> 22:54.407
All right.
Tomorrow 3:00 p.m.

22:54.440 --> 22:55.675
I'll be there.

22:55.708 --> 22:57.944
You make sure
you're on time, young man.

22:57.977 --> 23:00.613
I will. 3:00 p.m.

23:02.415 --> 23:05.685
Look... set it up like you said,

23:05.718 --> 23:07.687
but she already knew
what was goin' down.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.622
Hell, I thought she'd give me
some kind of leeway

23:09.655 --> 23:10.923
for coming clean, but...

23:10.957 --> 23:12.125
Tch.

23:13.392 --> 23:16.529
Hey, it's me.
Talk to me, fam.

23:18.464 --> 23:19.699
I don't know, man.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.601
She just ain't take
all that anger out on Tariq

23:21.634 --> 23:22.969
like I thought she would.

23:23.002 --> 23:25.404
<i>Now I gotta prove myself?</i>

23:25.438 --> 23:26.906
I just don't understand
why she ain't come down

23:26.939 --> 23:28.808
- on this nigga like she did me.
- Right.

23:28.841 --> 23:30.910
So that thing your cousin
almost went down for,

23:30.943 --> 23:32.678
that was--that was you
and Tariq did that?

23:32.712 --> 23:34.747
Whoa, nah, hey.

23:34.781 --> 23:36.616
I ain't say all that.

23:36.649 --> 23:38.017
You don't have to, Cane.

23:38.050 --> 23:40.419
You're not the type of guy
to go down for somebody else.

23:40.453 --> 23:42.054
So if you were planning
on running to save Zeke,

23:42.088 --> 23:43.956
that means you did it.

23:43.990 --> 23:45.691
<i>Now, I don't know,
it seems to me</i>

23:45.725 --> 23:48.127
like Monet's trying to figure
out what she wants to do.

23:48.161 --> 23:50.763
Right now she can't do shit,
because you are her plug.

23:50.797 --> 23:52.131
That makes you indispensable.

23:52.165 --> 23:54.033
Without you, her whole
business falls apart, man.

23:54.066 --> 23:57.203
Yeah, but shit don't work
without Tariq either.

23:57.436 --> 23:58.838
I don't know about that.

23:58.871 --> 24:01.140
Anybody can find
corner boys, Cane.

24:01.174 --> 24:03.709
But without supply,
nobody is gettin' high.

24:03.743 --> 24:06.479
So if she's givin' you a chance
to show and prove,

24:06.512 --> 24:09.448
be the right option--
give her no choice.

24:09.482 --> 24:10.983
Do not--I repeat--

24:11.017 --> 24:14.153
do not let her pick Tariq.

24:14.187 --> 24:16.956
Even if you have
to force her hand, hmm?

24:22.628 --> 24:25.765
I'm happy for Zeke.
I'm not sayin' that.

24:25.798 --> 24:28.100
But now that he's back,

24:28.134 --> 24:29.902
I'm back down number two
on the team

24:29.936 --> 24:32.605
and-and maybe second round
for NBA scouts.

24:32.638 --> 24:34.740
I didn't know you even
wanted to go into the draft

24:34.774 --> 24:35.908
this year.

24:35.942 --> 24:38.611
I was thinking about it.

24:38.644 --> 24:40.246
So you leavin' New York?

24:40.479 --> 24:42.748
I mean,

24:42.782 --> 24:45.718
now I got reasons to stay, hmm?

24:45.751 --> 24:47.820
<i>♪ Baby, I'm comfortable ♪</i>

24:47.854 --> 24:49.589
<i>♪ I'm comfortable ♪</i>

24:49.622 --> 24:52.692
<i>♪ Tell me what you want ♪</i>

24:52.725 --> 24:55.595
<i>Yo, Ev, open up.</i>

24:55.628 --> 24:57.697
<i>♪ I want it too
I want it too... ♪</i>

24:57.730 --> 24:59.265
Answer it.

25:04.537 --> 25:06.606
Yo, how you like me now?

25:06.639 --> 25:08.040
Oh, switched it up
with the hair I see, man.

25:08.074 --> 25:09.575
Yeah, I'm switching up
everything

25:09.609 --> 25:13.579
now that I'm a free man
and teams calling me again.

25:13.613 --> 25:15.181
Dru, what you doin' here?

25:15.214 --> 25:17.283
I ain't seen you
since they let me go.

25:17.516 --> 25:19.085
And Monet brought you
right back to school, huh?

25:19.118 --> 25:20.720
Yeah, cuz.

25:20.753 --> 25:22.021
what the fuck is going
on with your hair, man?

25:22.054 --> 25:24.824
Look, Freaky Zekey back, huh?

25:24.857 --> 25:27.093
Nah, nah, nah.
No Freaky Zekey. Not anymore.

25:27.126 --> 25:29.061
<i>You know, this whole
murder case thing,</i>

25:29.095 --> 25:30.730
it really got
my head on straight.

25:30.763 --> 25:32.965
I'ma be about my business
now on my own shit.

25:32.999 --> 25:34.867
You know what I mean?
Do what I wanna do,

25:34.901 --> 25:37.103
not what everybody tell me,
even Aunty Monet.

25:37.136 --> 25:38.104
I feel you.

25:38.137 --> 25:39.272
<i>-I feel that.</i>
- Yeah.

25:39.305 --> 25:40.640
You good though, Zeke?

25:40.673 --> 25:41.974
I ain't never been better.

25:42.008 --> 25:43.576
You know, they just said
I ain't have to go in,

25:43.609 --> 25:46.178
somethin' about no evidence,
and I bounced.

25:46.212 --> 25:47.880
- Ooh, congrats, man.
Thank you.

25:47.914 --> 25:49.682
You know who they
looking at now?

25:49.715 --> 25:52.318
Nah, uh, I don't.
I--and honestly, I don't care.

25:52.551 --> 25:54.887
All I know is
I get to get back out there,

25:54.921 --> 25:57.590
play with the fellas,
and I could hit that draft.

25:57.623 --> 26:00.192
You know, get into the league.

26:01.127 --> 26:03.029
How y'all know each other?

26:03.062 --> 26:05.631
Oh, shit.
We met at the club.

26:05.665 --> 26:08.200
Y-you know, the night
we all wanna forget?

26:08.234 --> 26:10.136
Oh, yo, yo, don't even

26:10.169 --> 26:11.304
bring that shit up.

26:11.337 --> 26:13.572
Hey, I'ma go show
my new look to the ladies.

26:13.606 --> 26:14.774
Ah.
- Good to see you, cuzo.

26:14.807 --> 26:16.609
You too.
Ev.

26:16.642 --> 26:18.644
- Hey, my man.
My man.

26:23.182 --> 26:25.651
Whoo!

26:25.685 --> 26:27.320
You lie real easy.

26:27.353 --> 26:29.188
You want me
to tell him the truth?

26:30.890 --> 26:32.758
I didn't think so.

26:33.859 --> 26:36.262
<i>Now, c'mon.
Playin' or what?</i>

26:38.597 --> 26:40.199
A'ight, I'm here.
What's so urgent?

26:40.232 --> 26:42.168
Di, I need you
to do me a favor, all right?

26:42.201 --> 26:44.003
I need to get some product
without Monet knowing.

26:44.036 --> 26:45.738
Why?

26:45.771 --> 26:48.374
It's hard to explain
right now, okay, Di?

26:48.607 --> 26:50.343
Just--just trust me, okay?

26:50.376 --> 26:52.745
I said why, Tariq?

26:52.778 --> 26:54.714
Zeke is home,
Monet won't explain how,

26:54.747 --> 26:56.749
and now you hit me up
trying to go around her?

26:56.782 --> 26:59.085
Nah, what's going on?

26:59.118 --> 27:01.020
A'ight, look,
I need to get money

27:01.053 --> 27:02.855
to get my sister
out of foster care.

27:02.888 --> 27:04.390
I got a family court
hearing tomorrow.

27:04.623 --> 27:05.992
My grandmother got a DWI,

27:06.025 --> 27:08.894
so my sister can't stay
with her anymore.

27:08.928 --> 27:12.198
Damn. A'ight, so what
are you gonna do?

27:12.231 --> 27:14.333
I mean, only thing I can do

27:14.367 --> 27:16.035
is try to get custody
of her myself.

27:16.068 --> 27:19.038
I gotta pay for a lawyer,
and I got to put a deposit

27:19.071 --> 27:20.840
on this fucking apartment,

27:20.873 --> 27:22.641
so it's a lot.

27:22.675 --> 27:24.377
And Monet, she shut down
CourseCorrect

27:24.410 --> 27:25.644
'cause she don't trust me,
so...

27:25.678 --> 27:27.113
I don't know
what the fuck to do.

27:27.146 --> 27:28.414
I mean, I would ask Cane,

27:28.647 --> 27:30.683
but I don't trust
that nigga either.

27:30.716 --> 27:33.386
So I need you
to ask him for me.

27:33.419 --> 27:37.690
Okay. I'll help you
on one condition.

27:37.723 --> 27:39.725
Anything. Talk to me.

27:39.759 --> 27:42.061
Tariq, I don't trust Cane
right now either.

27:42.094 --> 27:44.063
So I need to find out
what he's doing.

27:44.096 --> 27:46.899
Look, we already know
Cane killed Ramirez.

27:46.932 --> 27:49.268
So Ramirez's gun showing up
at the professor's murder scene

27:49.301 --> 27:50.803
while Zeke is under suspicion?

27:50.836 --> 27:52.805
I don't know, but that shit
don't sit right with me.

27:52.838 --> 27:55.274
Yeah, I-I feel you for sure.

27:55.307 --> 27:57.176
Yeah, but even before that,

27:57.209 --> 27:59.045
I was pretty sure Cane switched
the coke with sugar

27:59.078 --> 28:01.313
when Effie and Brayden
got jumped at Yale.

28:01.347 --> 28:03.049
You know, that actually
makes a lot of fucking sense,

28:03.082 --> 28:04.283
because he's the plug now.

28:04.316 --> 28:05.951
Exactly.

28:05.985 --> 28:07.987
Look, if you find
anything out about Cane,

28:08.020 --> 28:10.423
I need you to tell me, a'ight?
Anything.

28:10.456 --> 28:13.092
I got you.
Don't even worry about it.

28:13.125 --> 28:14.360
A'ight.

28:19.365 --> 28:22.068
Tariq is hiding
his business from Monet?

28:22.101 --> 28:23.803
For what?

28:26.472 --> 28:29.041
Listen, I'm not doing shit
until I know.

28:30.176 --> 28:32.478
He needs money for his sister.

28:32.711 --> 28:34.480
Cane, he's got
a custody hearing tomorrow,

28:34.713 --> 28:36.282
and he needs money
to pay a lawyer

28:36.315 --> 28:37.783
and to get a place to stay.

28:37.817 --> 28:40.019
So?
Sounds like a him problem.

28:40.052 --> 28:41.253
It might be,

28:41.287 --> 28:42.955
but I might make it
a you problem

28:42.988 --> 28:46.492
if I tell Monet you're the one
who sugared the coke.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.994
You know, when you wanted
back in with the family.

28:49.028 --> 28:50.863
Why the fuck
would you say all that?

28:50.896 --> 28:52.231
Why wouldn't I?

28:52.264 --> 28:54.066
You acting just like Monet,
thinking you know shit,

28:54.100 --> 28:56.001
putting niggas
under pressure with fake news.

28:56.035 --> 28:58.304
Fake news? A'ight.

28:58.337 --> 28:59.872
Well, how about
I tell Monet myself

28:59.905 --> 29:01.841
and let her decide
if you did it or not.

29:05.778 --> 29:07.213
Okay, damn, I'll handle it.

29:07.246 --> 29:08.814
Uh... what?

29:08.848 --> 29:10.249
- I'll do it.
- Right.

29:10.282 --> 29:11.450
By tonight, Cane.

29:11.484 --> 29:12.985
I'll handle it.

29:13.018 --> 29:15.454
Just make sure he comes
to get the product himself.

29:15.488 --> 29:17.056
All right.

29:17.089 --> 29:18.991
<i>Who's your friend, Brayden?</i>

29:19.024 --> 29:20.159
<i>My name's Lorenzo.</i>

29:20.192 --> 29:22.261
<i>Why, you looking
for a new friend?</i>

29:22.294 --> 29:23.829
Who's this other guy, Lorenzo?

29:23.863 --> 29:25.464
I thought he was gonna
be involved with the drugs,

29:25.498 --> 29:28.167
but I was wrong--he's just
the cousin of Zeke Cross.

29:28.200 --> 29:29.935
Cross' cousin
knows this Brayden kid?

29:29.969 --> 29:31.370
He wasn't there for Brayden.

29:31.403 --> 29:33.806
He was there for Brayden's
roommate, Tariq St. Patrick.

29:33.839 --> 29:35.174
Tariq tutors Zeke.

29:35.207 --> 29:37.243
Wait a second.
Where's the rest of the tape?

29:37.276 --> 29:39.778
They went out, so I left.

29:39.812 --> 29:41.347
Excuse me.

29:41.380 --> 29:42.515
<i>Lauren,</i>

29:42.548 --> 29:44.216
you may need to be
a little more aggressive.

29:44.250 --> 29:46.785
Reason being we're gonna
upgrade your device

29:46.819 --> 29:48.821
so we can listen live and coach
you on some questions.

29:48.854 --> 29:50.823
What?
No, I don't want to do that.

29:50.856 --> 29:52.358
Lauren, we're getting closer.

29:52.391 --> 29:53.559
I need you to be brave.

29:53.792 --> 29:55.094
<i>What else do you know</i>

29:55.127 --> 29:57.530
about Brayden and the guys
he hangs out with?

29:57.563 --> 30:00.032
Kamaal, I need a second.

30:00.065 --> 30:01.133
Excuse me, ladies.

30:02.501 --> 30:04.436
- What's this?
- Cousin Lorenzo.

30:04.470 --> 30:07.373
Full name is Lorenzo Tejada Jr.

30:07.406 --> 30:09.408
Goes by a childhood nickname,
Cane.

30:09.441 --> 30:11.110
He's got a few misdemeanors.

30:11.143 --> 30:12.978
Some violent offenses
that got knocked down.

30:13.012 --> 30:15.114
So you think this kid's
suspicious.

30:15.147 --> 30:17.416
If that Zeke's cousin,
he doesn't need Ramirez, right?

30:17.449 --> 30:18.584
Maybe Zeke gets his cousin
to pop the cop

30:18.817 --> 30:19.885
and take out the professor.

30:19.919 --> 30:21.220
We have no proof of that

30:21.253 --> 30:23.455
or even a motive
on why he'd want Ramirez dead.

30:23.489 --> 30:25.024
We're not getting much
from this Lauren kid either.

30:25.057 --> 30:26.058
This is a lead.

30:26.091 --> 30:27.459
Honestly,
I think that we need to

30:27.493 --> 30:29.361
take Tariq St. Patrick
more seriously.

30:29.395 --> 30:31.363
Maybe Carrie's right that
he and this Brayden kid

30:31.397 --> 30:32.831
are dealing drugs.

30:32.865 --> 30:34.300
Still doesn't give us
motive if Tariq or Brayden

30:34.333 --> 30:35.935
doesn't know
what the professor knew, okay?

30:35.968 --> 30:38.070
Let's look into this Cane.
It's solid.

30:38.103 --> 30:39.505
Yeah, okay.

30:39.538 --> 30:41.974
Look into it, but we cannot
take it to Jenny.

30:42.007 --> 30:43.008
Not yet.

30:43.042 --> 30:45.244
- Course.
- All right.

30:51.984 --> 30:54.186
The cops are not
looking at Zeke no more.

30:54.220 --> 30:56.889
There was a press conference
and everything--he's free.

30:58.090 --> 31:00.593
See, Mo, I told you
it would work out.

31:00.626 --> 31:02.628
Cops had no reason to hold him.

31:02.861 --> 31:06.398
Just had to have
a little faith and wait it out.

31:06.432 --> 31:08.434
Yeah.

31:08.467 --> 31:11.103
I guess I shoulda had faith.

31:15.574 --> 31:16.976
Yeah.

31:17.009 --> 31:19.044
<i>Mr. Tejada,
this is Cooper Saxe.</i>

31:19.078 --> 31:21.413
I'm the attorney your daughter
hired to help free you.

31:21.447 --> 31:24.883
We have a hearing tomorrow.
Can you speak freely?

31:24.917 --> 31:27.086
Yeah, give me a moment.

31:29.054 --> 31:31.490
I gotta take this, Mo.

31:33.225 --> 31:34.526
Deadass?

31:36.028 --> 31:37.396
A'ight.

31:51.310 --> 31:52.911
Mr. Saxe.

31:52.945 --> 31:57.182
Yeah, man, I can tell you
anything you need to know.

31:57.216 --> 31:58.684
Where is Kamaal?

31:58.917 --> 32:00.085
Ha.

32:00.119 --> 32:01.520
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

32:01.553 --> 32:03.489
You're bypassing
your babysitter?

32:03.522 --> 32:05.257
I know that Cross
wasn't the shooter

32:05.291 --> 32:06.558
in those murders,

32:06.592 --> 32:08.060
but I know
he's involved in this.

32:08.093 --> 32:10.362
Do you have
any evidence for that?

32:10.396 --> 32:12.965
Because I just held a press
conference that said otherwise.

32:12.998 --> 32:15.234
I been
looking into his family.

32:15.267 --> 32:16.702
He's got an uncle in jail.

32:16.935 --> 32:18.637
So we know the uncle
didn't do it.

32:18.671 --> 32:20.606
And a cousin with a rap sheet.

32:25.978 --> 32:27.346
"Lorenzo Tejada Jr.

32:27.379 --> 32:28.714
Nickname... Cane."

32:28.947 --> 32:30.616
Zeke's close with the Tejadas?

32:30.649 --> 32:33.185
Close enough to live with him
during his high school years.

32:33.218 --> 32:35.654
And it also happens
that the, uh,

32:35.688 --> 32:38.023
the family lives in
the dead cop's precinct.

32:41.727 --> 32:44.496
I may need more than this
to get Cross back involved.

32:44.530 --> 32:46.265
After that
press conference fiasco,

32:46.298 --> 32:48.067
I'm gonna need
a bulletproof case against him

32:48.100 --> 32:50.069
and this Cane Tejada.

32:58.477 --> 33:00.079
Come on. Let's go.
Your place.

33:00.112 --> 33:01.680
- Who's that guy?
- Nobody. Let's go.

33:10.756 --> 33:14.326
Told my sister Tariq
needed to be here himself

33:14.360 --> 33:16.428
for this little off-grid deal
to go down.

33:16.462 --> 33:18.097
Look, bro,
I just go where I'm told.

33:18.130 --> 33:20.733
Where's he at anyway?
Still don't know?

33:20.766 --> 33:22.134
Your guess is good as mine.

33:22.167 --> 33:23.602
Okay.

33:23.635 --> 33:25.404
Hey, what does he need
all this for?

33:25.437 --> 33:27.406
Y'all just picked up
not that long ago.

33:27.439 --> 33:28.474
Do you think
he tells me anything?

33:28.507 --> 33:29.708
I don't know, nigga.

33:29.742 --> 33:31.577
You said
y'all was equal partners.

33:31.610 --> 33:33.679
Am I right?

33:33.712 --> 33:36.382

35:38.537 --> 35:39.638
Looking for something?

35:39.671 --> 35:40.839
I wasn't looking
for shit, man.

35:40.873 --> 35:42.708
I was just making a call,
I swear.

35:42.741 --> 35:45.177
<i>What's up, Nuff?</i>

35:45.210 --> 35:46.578
Caught someone spyin' on us.

35:46.612 --> 35:48.647
Man,
I wasn't spying on shit.

35:48.680 --> 35:50.616
Who the fuck is that?

35:50.649 --> 35:53.519
That one of Mahoney's boys?
Keep him still.

35:55.387 --> 35:56.822
<i>Get off me,
I ain't do anything!</i>

35:56.855 --> 35:58.423
<i>I ain't see anything.</i>

35:58.457 --> 36:00.192
What?

36:00.225 --> 36:01.860
You know him?

36:04.263 --> 36:06.665
No. I don't know him.

36:08.300 --> 36:11.703
You hear that?
Does not look good for you.

36:11.737 --> 36:13.605
You ain't got no friends here.

36:23.282 --> 36:26.451
You sure it's not
another one of your friends?

36:26.485 --> 36:28.854
Nuff has never been good
at stopping once he starts.

36:28.887 --> 36:30.455
Look, I just said I never
seen the little nigga

36:30.489 --> 36:31.690
before in my life.

36:32.824 --> 36:34.393
Let him go.

36:34.426 --> 36:36.428
Now, Nuff.

36:41.967 --> 36:43.936
Get the fuck outta here.

36:54.880 --> 36:56.515
F--

36:56.548 --> 36:57.649
fuck!

37:04.256 --> 37:05.958
Oh, my God, what happened?

37:05.991 --> 37:07.793
Is Monet here?
I need to talk to her.

37:07.826 --> 37:10.262
Look, I don't know
where she is--I'm here alone.

37:11.663 --> 37:14.433
Here, c-come inside.

37:16.535 --> 37:17.970
<i>♪ Had to risk it all ♪</i>

37:18.003 --> 37:19.972
Um, you sh--

37:20.005 --> 37:21.707
you should, uh,
you should go home.

37:21.740 --> 37:23.542
- I'll call you later.
- Yeah, I'll call you later.

37:23.575 --> 37:27.379
- Yo, what's going on here?
- Just get some bandages, Dru.

37:30.415 --> 37:31.817
Shit.

37:33.285 --> 37:35.487
I don't think he was
one of Mahoney's crew.

37:35.520 --> 37:37.522
He wouldn't have sent him
alone and unarmed.

37:37.556 --> 37:40.892
Mecca, I handled it.

37:40.926 --> 37:42.394
Ain't no way that skinny punk

37:42.427 --> 37:44.029
come back for another ass
whooping.

37:44.262 --> 37:47.299
But... he did show up

37:47.332 --> 37:49.301
right when you did.

37:50.802 --> 37:53.772
You sure you ain't bring him?

37:53.805 --> 37:55.407
That true?

37:55.440 --> 37:58.610
Yeah, he could have
been following him,

37:58.644 --> 38:00.946
but Cane said
he didn't know him.

38:00.979 --> 38:02.481
<i>How we know
it ain't another one of</i>

38:02.514 --> 38:03.882
his little friends?

38:05.684 --> 38:07.719
I got this phone off him but--

38:07.753 --> 38:10.922
Cane, did you know him?

38:12.424 --> 38:14.493
You let him follow you here?

38:17.929 --> 38:19.798
Nah, I didn't.

38:21.967 --> 38:23.001
Okay.

38:23.035 --> 38:24.603
<i>What?</i>

38:24.636 --> 38:26.304
You just gon'
take his word for it?

38:27.572 --> 38:29.508
If you didn't know
he was with Mahoney,

38:29.541 --> 38:32.811
you should've never put your
fucking hands on that kid.

38:32.844 --> 38:35.781
One civilian complaint, Nuff,
puts us all at risk.

38:51.663 --> 38:53.432
Now look at you.

38:54.866 --> 38:56.101
You know, he always
did talk too much

38:56.334 --> 38:57.836
for somebody expendable.

39:00.472 --> 39:01.807
Clean this up.

39:26.631 --> 39:29.367
So I saw you clear that
basketball player on the news.

39:29.401 --> 39:31.670
- He really ain't do it?

39:31.703 --> 39:35.040
'Cause his interview--ooh!
Was a mess.

39:35.073 --> 39:37.375
That's the problem
with innocent clients.

39:37.409 --> 39:39.444
They're not prepared to lie.

39:39.478 --> 39:41.880
What do you want, Davis?

39:41.913 --> 39:44.082
I got a knitting circle
I gotta get back to.

39:44.116 --> 39:45.817
Really? A knitting circle?

39:45.851 --> 39:47.552
All right.

39:47.586 --> 39:48.820
The white boy I hired

39:48.854 --> 39:50.922
is working on an appeal
for one of our clients.

39:50.956 --> 39:53.558
Very similar circumstances
to yours.

39:53.592 --> 39:55.994
Manslaughter, buncha
eyewitnesses, long rap sheet.

39:56.027 --> 39:57.462
Yeah, yeah.

39:57.496 --> 39:59.164
Hey, hey, if he gets
this guy out,

39:59.397 --> 40:01.032
I'm gonna pivot him
right to you.

40:02.100 --> 40:05.470
Are you, uh, you sure
you wanna do this, bro?

40:05.504 --> 40:07.172
'Cause I'm all right in here.

40:07.405 --> 40:08.740
I mean that.

40:12.778 --> 40:14.746
Things could come out,
you know.

40:16.815 --> 40:19.184
Not the way
I'ma have my boy play it.

40:20.685 --> 40:23.488
I will do anything
to get you out.

40:26.591 --> 40:29.060
And I would do anything

40:29.094 --> 40:31.129
to keep you out.

40:31.163 --> 40:32.731
Do you understand?

40:35.801 --> 40:37.836
Yeah.

40:39.571 --> 40:41.206
Yeah.

40:50.715 --> 40:53.552
I apologize for being late.
I was in traffic.

40:53.585 --> 40:55.120
Yes.

40:55.153 --> 40:57.622
Well, the apartment's
no longer available.

40:57.656 --> 40:59.090
What?

40:59.124 --> 41:01.493
Tariq, where have you been?

41:01.526 --> 41:03.228
why haven't you been
answering your phone,

41:03.461 --> 41:05.964
and what happened to your face?

41:05.997 --> 41:07.032
Are you okay?

41:07.065 --> 41:09.000
Yeah, I got robbed,
but I'm fine.

41:09.034 --> 41:10.869
Lauren, I need to talk to her.
I need this place.

41:10.902 --> 41:12.704
Okay.
Well, she's not coming back.

41:12.737 --> 41:13.905
She was already on the fence

41:13.939 --> 41:15.607
before you showed up
looking like this.

41:15.640 --> 41:16.942
I don't know what to do.

41:16.975 --> 41:18.677
The court's not gonna
give me custody of Yas

41:18.710 --> 41:20.745
if I don't show them
proof of a place to stay.

41:20.779 --> 41:22.047
I'm fucked!

41:23.715 --> 41:26.151
Okay, look,
I think I have an idea.

41:26.184 --> 41:27.719
Come on.

41:37.662 --> 41:39.598
This is my brother's spot.

41:39.631 --> 41:42.033
I was gonna offer it
to you before,

41:42.067 --> 41:44.569
but I know you're not
the best at taking help.

41:44.603 --> 41:48.707
I mean... doesn't
your brother need this?

41:48.740 --> 41:51.243
Um... he hasn't been able

41:51.276 --> 41:53.912
to live outside of
a halfway house for a while.

41:53.945 --> 41:56.915
But my parents gave me the keys
for when he's back,

41:56.948 --> 42:01.686
so how about we say
it's not forever but for right now.

42:02.787 --> 42:06.925
I... I don't even know
what to say, Lauren, like--

42:06.958 --> 42:08.226
Tariq, it's okay.

42:08.260 --> 42:11.062
I really wanna help you
and your sister be together.

42:13.265 --> 42:14.766
Let me show you around.

42:16.668 --> 42:19.537
So this pulls out into a bed,

42:19.571 --> 42:22.707
and then there's
a bedroom over there.

42:22.741 --> 42:24.709
Thank you.

42:24.743 --> 42:26.578
I really appreciate
you doing this for me.

42:26.611 --> 42:29.014
Thank you
for letting me do it.

42:34.085 --> 42:35.220
Oh, wait.

42:38.556 --> 42:39.891
Here.

42:39.925 --> 42:42.727
You're gonna need a lease
for your custody case.

42:44.195 --> 42:45.764
You know, if you live here,

42:45.797 --> 42:48.733
you wouldn't have to stay
with Brayden anymore.

42:48.767 --> 42:50.702
I mean, I don't know.

42:50.735 --> 42:52.771
Staying with Brayden
ain't that bad. He's cool.

42:52.804 --> 42:55.807
I know, but...

42:55.840 --> 42:58.109
don't you think it was weird
how happy he was

42:58.143 --> 42:59.811
when Professor Reynolds died?

42:59.844 --> 43:02.213
Offering all those girls
a shoulder to cry on?

43:02.247 --> 43:06.618
No. Look, Brayden didn't even
know Professor Reynolds

43:06.651 --> 43:08.253
until I told him about him.

43:08.286 --> 43:10.855
All right? So honestly I don't
even know why he would care.

43:10.889 --> 43:13.692
Yeah, I mean maybe,

43:13.725 --> 43:16.628
but Professor Reynolds
probably knew who Brayden was.

43:16.661 --> 43:18.630
He's very visible as a Weston.

43:18.663 --> 43:22.133
And what about that book
Professor Reynolds was writing?

43:22.167 --> 43:24.102
You don't think
that was about Brayden?

43:24.970 --> 43:26.638
Look, no.

43:26.671 --> 43:28.773
That book was definitely
not about Brayden.

43:28.807 --> 43:30.642
Are you sure?

43:30.675 --> 43:34.112
Yes. Professor Reynolds
told me who it was about.

43:34.145 --> 43:36.114
<i>On top of that,
that nigga only wrote about</i>

43:36.147 --> 43:38.183
<i>Black people anyway, so...</i>

43:38.216 --> 43:40.352
<i>So not Brayden?</i>

43:40.385 --> 43:42.020
<i>No.</i>

43:44.189 --> 43:46.257
Reynolds told him
what the book was about.

43:46.291 --> 43:47.926
Yeah, which means
it's probably not about him.

43:47.959 --> 43:49.861
That means
Carrie's reaching again.

43:49.894 --> 43:51.730
Tariq was listed
as one of the students

43:51.763 --> 43:53.231
Reynolds saw the day
he was murdered.

43:53.264 --> 43:55.300
And I looked into
Tariq's Choate record.

43:55.333 --> 43:57.268
He was living with
Weston way back then

43:57.302 --> 43:59.270
and he was expelled for drugs.

43:59.304 --> 44:02.707
If Tariq is the Stansfield link
to the drug operation

44:02.741 --> 44:05.710
and knew Reynolds was writing
about it, that's motive.

44:05.744 --> 44:07.712
Why would Reynolds
tell St. Patrick

44:07.746 --> 44:09.280
that he was going to
expose him in his book?

44:09.314 --> 44:10.949
Doesn't even make
any fucking sense.

44:10.982 --> 44:12.650
Much less, it's not enough
for a warrant.

44:12.684 --> 44:14.252
It's enough
for Stansfield to open up

44:14.285 --> 44:16.921
Tariq's dorm
so we can look around.

44:30.035 --> 44:32.103
- What's this?
<i>-It's what you wanted.</i>

44:32.137 --> 44:33.905
It's Tariq's phone.

44:33.938 --> 44:35.974
He has a custody hearing
tomorrow at 3:00.

44:36.007 --> 44:37.675
For his sister.

44:40.011 --> 44:41.880
They could've killed us both
for what you did.

44:41.913 --> 44:43.748
Yeah, I know what you did.

44:43.782 --> 44:45.116
Sending Tariq to follow me
to the connect.

44:45.150 --> 44:46.818
I'm not stupid, Monet.

44:46.851 --> 44:49.220
No matter how many times
you say that to me.

44:49.254 --> 44:52.323
All this time I'm out here
blaming Tariq for everything.

44:52.357 --> 44:54.359
But it's clear to me now
you're the problem.

44:54.392 --> 44:56.227
I'm here really thinking
you was gonna let me back in,

44:56.261 --> 44:58.063
but you was gonna play me
like you play him,

44:58.096 --> 44:59.831
like you play all of us--
you're a fucking joke.

44:59.864 --> 45:01.800
Boy, I didn't fucking
make you kill Ramirez

45:01.833 --> 45:02.967
or Reynolds.

45:03.001 --> 45:04.436
I do whatever
I fucking need to do

45:04.469 --> 45:06.471
to make sure this family
and this business don't fall.

45:06.704 --> 45:08.840
But that's the fucking problem!

45:08.873 --> 45:11.476
It's always family
and fucking business.

45:11.709 --> 45:13.311
What am I to you, huh?

45:13.344 --> 45:14.946
Your soldier
or your fucking son?

45:14.979 --> 45:16.848
You're both.

45:16.881 --> 45:19.384
Then what kind of fucking
mother does that make you?

45:24.255 --> 45:26.758
Make sure Tariq gets his phone.

45:37.035 --> 45:38.269
Get in.

45:44.375 --> 45:46.311
Monet,
I can't talk right now.

45:46.344 --> 45:48.079
I got my sister's hearing.

45:48.113 --> 45:50.281
I'm tired of playing
with you, Tariq.

45:50.315 --> 45:51.783
You failed.

45:51.816 --> 45:54.085
Cane wasn't 'posed to find out
what you was doing.

45:54.119 --> 45:56.821
Listen, I didn't tell Cane.
I-I got caught following him.

45:56.855 --> 45:58.456
And when you got caught,
did you call me?

45:58.490 --> 46:00.425
No.

46:00.458 --> 46:02.827
<i>So these are the
consequences of your actions.</i>

46:02.861 --> 46:05.096
You never think the dirt
that you do

46:05.130 --> 46:07.065
is gonna come back to you.

46:07.098 --> 46:09.100
So we gonna sit here and
wait till you lose your sister

46:09.134 --> 46:12.971
like I almost lost Zeke.
Shouldn't take long.

46:14.806 --> 46:16.207
Look, I got information, right?

46:16.241 --> 46:17.442
I got a address.
I got a name.

46:17.475 --> 46:19.544
The name is Mecca.
I can get more.

46:19.777 --> 46:22.881
Mecca and an address.
That's it?

46:22.914 --> 46:25.550
Look, let me go, and I can
get you more information.

46:25.783 --> 46:26.918
That's it.

46:28.286 --> 46:31.022
Nah, I can't let you go, Tariq.

46:31.055 --> 46:33.391
See, this is your consequence
with Zeke

46:33.424 --> 46:37.562
and for breaking our rules
so this doesn't happen again.

46:37.795 --> 46:39.564
Now you know
I'm the one in control.

46:40.865 --> 46:41.933
You feel me?

46:52.210 --> 46:54.145
You know, you're wrong.

46:54.179 --> 46:55.580
You think you in control,

46:55.813 --> 46:57.849
but you on a island
and you don't even know it.

46:57.882 --> 46:59.184
Boy, you better watch
your step

46:59.217 --> 47:01.352
before you say some shit
you can't take back.

47:01.386 --> 47:03.354
So, you--you really think
you could do this shit

47:03.388 --> 47:04.589
without me?
Half of the shit

47:04.822 --> 47:06.991
going on under your nose,
you don't even see it.

47:07.025 --> 47:09.561
Cane, he replaced Rico's work
with sugar

47:09.594 --> 47:11.429
just to get you
to take him back.

47:13.164 --> 47:14.999
Dru, he's still fucking
that nigga

47:15.033 --> 47:16.901
that dropped him
and Zeke's name to the school

47:16.935 --> 47:18.369
about that dead body
in the pool.

47:21.239 --> 47:23.508
And Diana...

47:23.541 --> 47:25.944
Diana stole that money
out your bar.

47:27.111 --> 47:29.480
You can't do none of this shit
without me.

47:29.514 --> 47:31.449
You need me,
and I need my sister.

47:31.482 --> 47:33.551
So what are we doing?

48:03.348 --> 48:06.417
My client is here,
Your Honor.

48:06.451 --> 48:10.321
<i>You're late,
Mr. St. Patrick.</i>

48:10.355 --> 48:12.223
I'd like to reopen
the issue of granting him

48:12.257 --> 48:14.626
custody rather than sending
the child into foster care.

48:14.659 --> 48:16.461
I don't see
how your client being here

48:16.494 --> 48:19.364
changes the fact that he's
barely an adult, Mr. Warren,

48:19.397 --> 48:21.933
and that he looks like
he's just been in a brawl.

48:21.966 --> 48:24.969
I'm inclined to keep
the child in foster care

48:25.003 --> 48:26.471
<i>until her
grandmother's completed</i>

48:26.504 --> 48:28.640
the requisite recovery program.

48:28.673 --> 48:30.475
I understand your concerns,
Your Honor,

48:30.508 --> 48:32.176
but my client's circumstances

48:32.210 --> 48:35.346
are not those of
the average teenager.

48:35.380 --> 48:38.916
He has shown time and time
again that he is willing

48:38.950 --> 48:43.054
and able to step into a role
far beyond his years

48:43.087 --> 48:46.257
and that he cares deeply
for his sister.

48:46.291 --> 48:49.027
I, therefore, beg the court
to reconsider.

48:49.060 --> 48:50.561
And by the way,
while I have no doubt

48:50.595 --> 48:52.664
that Ms. Green
feels the same way,

48:52.697 --> 48:57.635
unfortunately, she has misused
money from the trust fund.

48:57.669 --> 49:02.273
Tariq can provide stability
until Ms. Green has recovered.

49:02.307 --> 49:05.543
Surely, a family member
is better than state care.

49:07.278 --> 49:09.414
Your Honor, I just...

49:10.648 --> 49:12.450
I just wanna
keep my family together.

49:12.483 --> 49:15.153
You know, my baby sister
is all I have.

49:15.186 --> 49:16.521
I mean, I have
everything together.

49:16.554 --> 49:17.588
I have an apartment.

49:17.622 --> 49:19.457
Everything is there on the file.

49:19.490 --> 49:21.159
Only thing I don't have
is a chance.

49:21.192 --> 49:24.128
He's a baby, Your Honor.

49:24.162 --> 49:25.396
He can't raise a baby.

49:25.430 --> 49:27.298
Did you use
the child's funds

49:27.332 --> 49:29.267
to support a drinking habit?

49:29.300 --> 49:32.670
I admit my drinking
got away from me, Your Honor,

49:32.704 --> 49:34.372
but I'm better now.

49:34.405 --> 49:37.608
Have you completed
a rehabilitation program?

49:37.642 --> 49:43.114
No, but I have prayed on it,
Your Honor,

49:43.147 --> 49:45.249
Your Honor, I can pay
for my grandmother

49:45.283 --> 49:47.118
to go to rehab, all right?

49:47.151 --> 49:48.653
I love--I love my grandmother,

49:48.686 --> 49:52.056
but she's just not in Yasmin's
best interest right now.

49:52.090 --> 49:55.360
Circumstances for this family
have been very, very hard

49:55.393 --> 49:58.463
and they just getting harder.

49:58.496 --> 50:00.398
<i>I want my grandmother
to be strong enough,</i>

50:00.431 --> 50:05.036
and she will be in the future,
but I'm strong enough now,

50:05.069 --> 50:07.772
and I can take this
responsibility for my sister.

50:10.041 --> 50:13.177
I'll grant you custody
on a temporary basis,

50:13.211 --> 50:15.446
- but one misstep...
- Ughh!

50:15.480 --> 50:17.582
And I'll be forced to remand
the child back into state care.

50:17.615 --> 50:20.184
Don't test me,
Mr. St. Patrick.

50:20.218 --> 50:21.285
Thank you, Your Honor.

50:21.319 --> 50:23.154
Congratulations Thank you.

50:44.742 --> 50:47.078
There's nothing here.

50:47.111 --> 50:48.646
Well, then you need
to vacate now.

50:49.714 --> 50:51.449
Hold on.

51:04.061 --> 51:06.697
Now, what were you saying?

51:10.435 --> 51:13.070
I led my kids down
the wrong path, Dante.

51:15.239 --> 51:19.177
They don't trust me,
they don't trust each other.

51:19.210 --> 51:22.280
Fuck, I thought I was
teaching them the life.

51:22.313 --> 51:24.348
Making them strong.

51:24.382 --> 51:26.083
Shit.

51:27.618 --> 51:29.720
Maybe we do need a fresh start.

51:32.356 --> 51:34.759
Maybe I do too.

51:38.763 --> 51:43.367
Maybe I could meet Zeke now,
if you're ready.

51:45.203 --> 51:46.804
I need some time.

51:46.838 --> 51:49.607
Let me speak to my kids,

51:49.640 --> 51:52.176
but I think so.

51:54.512 --> 51:56.681
Yes.

52:00.384 --> 52:01.752
Hey...

52:01.786 --> 52:03.654
<i>♪ I just wanna
Love you baby ♪</i>
