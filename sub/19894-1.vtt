03:56.902 --> 03:59.203
If I die in a combat zone,

04:00.972 --> 04:02.907
box me up and ship me home.

04:06.244 --> 04:08.762
Still going hunting
with the morons?

04:21.543 --> 04:25.479
If we're eating what we kill,
that's your last supper.

04:25.547 --> 04:28.449
Well, if I don't shoot anything,
I'll just eat Quincy's dog.

04:28.517 --> 04:30.851
Oh, don't listen to those
animals, Wolfgang.

04:30.919 --> 04:34.638
<i>Any buds? Doses? "X"?</i>

04:34.706 --> 04:36.957
Get a job.

04:37.025 --> 04:39.042
Got one.

04:41.813 --> 04:45.433
<i>- Were you in the shit?
- Did you kill anybody?</i>

04:45.500 --> 04:48.902
Three... that I saw die.

04:50.839 --> 04:52.623
<i>Semper fi.</i>

04:54.960 --> 04:57.260
You ever see anybody die?

05:03.077 --> 05:04.427
One, two, three, go!

05:09.324 --> 05:13.277
He can't. This is a guys' weekend.
Bros, not hos.

05:13.345 --> 05:15.996
<i>Man, just 'cause Jeanette left you
doesn't mean everybody has to be single.</i>

05:16.064 --> 05:18.833
She didn't leave me.
Our priorities changed.

05:18.900 --> 05:21.368
Right. She wanted to screw
the night crew at Walmart.

05:21.537 --> 05:23.737
Costco, asshole.
There's a difference.

05:23.805 --> 05:25.772
Yeah, because at Costco
when you buy a case of condoms,

05:25.840 --> 05:27.774
you get a coupon
to fuck Jeanette.

05:27.842 --> 05:29.343
Never trust someone
who buys in bulk.

05:29.544 --> 05:31.311
Thanks for being
such good friends,

05:31.379 --> 05:35.232
<i>but John won't let me down.
Fifty bucks-- Brooks is coming.</i>

05:35.299 --> 05:37.100
What do you think,
Q-sinart?

05:37.168 --> 05:39.570
<i>Aw, I don't care.
I got Wolfgang.</i>

05:39.638 --> 05:41.272
Good comparison.

05:44.609 --> 05:46.460
That's my boy John.

05:47.845 --> 05:50.397
And that's his girl.

05:56.488 --> 05:58.188
<i>Hey, Brooks,
how's the art hangin'?</i>

05:58.256 --> 06:00.674
Apparently, it's not the kind of work
buyers want to see on their walls.

06:00.742 --> 06:03.410
All right, you boys ready to
see how the other half lives?

06:03.478 --> 06:07.464
50 times one. And I hope you didn't
give all your singles to that vet.

06:07.532 --> 06:11.868
Don't worry. I'm taking it out
of part of your gas money.

06:27.035 --> 06:29.870
Perfect place to bury a bitch.

08:16.494 --> 08:18.210
I don't know what
this shitty music is.

08:18.236 --> 08:19.221
It's Area Weapons.

08:19.264 --> 08:21.582
It's Area Weapons.

08:21.650 --> 08:23.934
Laura wants to know
if you hunted as a kid.

08:24.219 --> 08:27.171
- Yeah, with my uncle.
- Shit.

08:27.239 --> 08:30.391
<i>Must be out of range.
Too bad.</i>

08:30.458 --> 08:32.645
It was such an
interesting conversation.

08:32.672 --> 08:34.219
It beats talking to you.

08:37.565 --> 08:40.464
So what's your new series
of paintings about again?

08:40.890 --> 08:41.827
The depravities of war.

09:27.031 --> 09:29.115
- You're pumpin', Q-bone.
- Yeah.

09:29.183 --> 09:31.535
Wolfie needs some water
anyway.

09:38.509 --> 09:41.695
- I need to get directions.
- To your own ranch?

09:41.746 --> 09:44.114
My uncle's. I haven't been
here since I was 16.

09:44.181 --> 09:46.066
Things change.

09:57.229 --> 09:59.063
How you doin' today, hoss?

10:03.284 --> 10:05.219
Better than some.

10:06.604 --> 10:08.372
We're lookin'
for the Hickman ranch.

10:08.440 --> 10:10.674
What do you bright-lighters
want with that place?

10:10.741 --> 10:14.160
- I'm John Hickman, sir.
- Hey, John.

10:14.228 --> 10:16.914
Haven't seen your face
in a while.

10:17.299 --> 10:19.466
You been takin' your turn over
there, fightin' in the desert?

10:19.534 --> 10:22.019
- Not my war, sir.
- Well, maybe not.

10:22.304 --> 10:25.488
But leap in.
Way things are goin',

10:25.556 --> 10:27.490
one's gonna find you.

10:32.730 --> 10:35.933
Haven't sold many of these
since your uncle--

10:36.000 --> 10:37.801
Well, it's a damn shame.

10:37.869 --> 10:39.736
<i>So how do we get there?</i>

10:44.225 --> 10:46.860
You know the Tibbs place?

10:47.162 --> 10:49.296
You hike out past
where Fish Rock Road dead-ends--

10:49.363 --> 10:51.098
Can you draw us a map?

11:13.688 --> 11:15.956
You're right here.

11:16.024 --> 11:20.043
From Jimmy Creek,
go around Indian Hill...

11:20.111 --> 11:22.079
to the flat near the curve.

11:24.482 --> 11:28.835
Gonna find what you're lookin' for
tucked right back in there.

12:03.054 --> 12:05.055
Tell me somethin'.

12:05.122 --> 12:07.057
Did you come to hunt him?

12:13.315 --> 12:16.716
That kid, he comes
from a long line of warriors.

12:16.784 --> 12:19.019
His daddy and his uncle,

12:19.086 --> 12:21.205
they got silver stars
in Vietnam.

12:21.272 --> 12:23.277
- I heard another uncle
didn't make it back.

12:23.303 --> 12:24.549
Real heroes often don't.

12:24.592 --> 12:29.263
One man's heroism
is another family's tragedy.

12:31.349 --> 12:33.216
Did you get that one?

12:33.284 --> 12:35.736
Yeah, buddy.
All 320 pounds of him.

12:35.803 --> 12:38.505
What's the biggest wild hog
you ever heard of around here?

12:38.573 --> 12:40.924
Well, they say the Ripper
weighs 3,000 pounds.

12:41.259 --> 12:42.909
Bullshit.
Yeah? Who killed him?

12:42.977 --> 12:45.829
Nobody.

12:45.896 --> 12:48.232
He's still out there.

13:06.717 --> 13:10.170
- Kill it.
- Bloodthirsty.

13:10.238 --> 13:12.822
<i>- Just kill the fuckin' thing.
- Relax.</i>

13:14.308 --> 13:18.144
Go on, little guy.
Not there.

13:28.088 --> 13:29.907
What the fuck?

13:34.012 --> 13:37.531
<i>Nice shot, Robin Hood.
I want the rattle.</i>

13:37.598 --> 13:39.832
You hunters have no respect.

13:42.070 --> 13:43.620
You see this Gurkha blade?

13:43.821 --> 13:47.257
It can cut through a llama's head
with one whack.

13:47.325 --> 13:50.843
But it's never drawn
without tastin' blood.

13:50.911 --> 13:53.346
Same with this gun.

14:18.556 --> 14:21.408
Take a bath, hippie.

14:25.864 --> 14:29.383
You have a nice visit
in these parts,

14:29.500 --> 14:31.401
Negro.

14:49.771 --> 14:52.005
What are you waiting for, Ben?

14:58.963 --> 15:01.361
I can't believe you pulled
the magnum out on that freak.

15:01.387 --> 15:02.774
What if he calls the police?

15:02.817 --> 15:05.536
Threatening us with a machete?
Did you see that dirt-head cut himself?

15:05.603 --> 15:08.505
Yeah, and I saw "Kid Crossbow"
kill that snake. Thwack!

15:08.573 --> 15:10.541
<i>- What if he follows us, John?
- I hope he does.</i>

15:10.608 --> 15:12.559
I'll take his head home
as a trophy.

15:12.627 --> 15:15.462
<i>He's not following us.
All right? No cops are gonna come.</i>

15:15.529 --> 15:18.298
<i>Shit like this happens here
all the time.</i>

15:18.366 --> 15:21.718
Ben, put that fucking gun away
before it goes off.

15:24.922 --> 15:27.390
I should have stayed in the city.
I'm with Brooks.

15:27.592 --> 15:30.760
Pull up your panty hose, Q-nut.
There's no turnin' back.

15:51.616 --> 15:53.617
Why don't we
switch spots?

16:12.019 --> 16:14.937
<i>Now you're supposed
to stick it 'tween her garter, Q-tip.</i>

16:16.307 --> 16:20.077
Uhh! How much farther?

16:21.212 --> 16:23.630
<i>There's the map.</i>

16:23.698 --> 16:28.067
- I think we're up near her left nipple.
- No, actually, we're, uh--

16:28.135 --> 16:29.753
we're down near her pubes.

16:32.056 --> 16:34.491
You know, there's a reason you guys
don't have girlfriends.

17:00.184 --> 17:03.353
We can drop you and Brooks off here
if you don't wanna hunt.

17:10.743 --> 17:13.329
We could ask them
for directions.

17:46.797 --> 17:48.698
I know where we are now.

18:04.699 --> 18:08.869
<i>- I wonder who got those pigs.
- Big Bad Wolf.</i>

18:56.366 --> 19:00.437
<i>"Death walks on all fours."</i>

20:19.901 --> 20:22.936
- Your uncle was quite a hunter.
- Some of these are mine.

20:24.138 --> 20:27.774
<i>- That was a long time ago.</i>

20:31.078 --> 20:34.080
<i>You fuckin' pussy!
That's a possum.</i>

20:34.148 --> 20:36.933
I thought it was a rat.

20:40.237 --> 20:42.872
Good boar, R.D.
This is great.

20:42.939 --> 20:44.740
You should have
stewed up that possum.

20:44.808 --> 20:46.876
Then we could have
invited John's neighbors.

20:48.111 --> 20:50.346
Do you think they did that
to your uncle's place?

20:50.414 --> 20:53.216
Wasn't them. What happened
to your uncle?

20:53.284 --> 20:55.217
Became an alcoholic.

20:55.285 --> 20:58.354
- What else is there to do out here?
- Hunt hogs.

20:58.556 --> 21:01.457
- Death walks on all fours.
- That's bullshit.

21:01.525 --> 21:03.977
The store owner said there's a
3,000-pound pig rooting out here--

21:04.044 --> 21:05.979
A real "Hogzilla."

21:06.046 --> 21:09.548
Pigs don't get that big, do they?
Domestics can.

21:09.616 --> 21:12.786
As I kid I saw one at the county fair
that was 2,000 pounds.

21:12.853 --> 21:17.040
<i>But wild hogs-- they don't
get much bigger than 350.</i>

21:17.042 --> 21:20.059
And tusks?
Like razor wire.

21:20.127 --> 21:22.629
County fair.

21:22.697 --> 21:25.465
There was a rodeo too.
It was fun.

21:27.234 --> 21:29.669
Yeah? I don't know.

21:29.736 --> 21:31.904
There's something I don't trust
about white people with ropes.

21:31.973 --> 21:34.590
<i>What do people
do out here for a living?</i>

21:34.658 --> 21:37.327
Used to be
a toxic waste dump.

21:37.395 --> 21:39.896
Now they're hoping
for a prison.

21:39.964 --> 21:43.533
In the meantime, these hills
are filled with marijuana.

21:45.168 --> 21:45.872
Really?

21:45.898 --> 21:48.713
Pot's the biggest cash
crop in California.

21:48.756 --> 21:51.958
Fuck hunting.
Let's get high.

21:53.594 --> 21:55.695
<i>At least I've
been deer hunting.</i>

21:55.763 --> 21:57.697
<i>I saw that piddly rack
in your garage.</i>

21:57.765 --> 21:59.748
<i>We're not huntin' Bambi.
What have you</i>

21:59.774 --> 22:02.060
<i>ever shot besides targets
at the gun club?</i>

22:02.102 --> 22:05.672
<i>At least I didn't stand by when
my friend was in trouble.</i>

22:05.740 --> 22:08.775
All right, double or nothing on--

22:08.843 --> 22:11.310
You done, boy?

22:11.378 --> 22:13.513
Let's get back
to our tent...

22:13.581 --> 22:15.582
before the bogeyman gets us.

22:17.051 --> 22:19.886
How come you never really talk
about your uncle?

22:22.590 --> 22:24.624
What is there to say?

22:24.692 --> 22:27.977
When my father died,
he sort of took over that role.

22:29.296 --> 22:31.313
Taught me how to be a man.

22:31.381 --> 22:33.282
Shoot straight.

22:33.517 --> 22:35.818
We're living together
a year.

22:37.104 --> 22:40.373
When you pulled that crossbow
out of the closet--

22:41.441 --> 22:43.627
I didn't even know
you were a hunter.

22:44.695 --> 22:46.696
I'm not anymore.

22:48.232 --> 22:51.134
There's something in you that comes
alive when you're out there...

22:51.201 --> 22:53.870
putting the sneak
on your prey.

22:56.440 --> 22:58.674
Tracking.

23:00.344 --> 23:02.578
You have a purpose.

23:04.482 --> 23:07.450
A well-defined objective.

23:08.852 --> 23:12.188
A mission
to assert your authority.

23:12.256 --> 23:15.324
Most incredible rush,

23:17.077 --> 23:20.063
getting an animal
in your sights.

23:21.415 --> 23:23.966
Knowing that it's them
and not you--

23:25.369 --> 23:28.038
there's an intense power...

23:31.808 --> 23:35.078
knowing that you're gonna
spill its blood--

23:35.146 --> 23:37.263
that you're gonna take...

23:37.331 --> 23:39.765
this living,

23:39.833 --> 23:42.001
breathing thing's life.

23:45.572 --> 23:48.341
There's just something
so natural...

23:48.409 --> 23:50.743
about the way blood flows,

23:52.712 --> 23:54.713
reflex of your finger.

24:00.321 --> 24:02.355
It can't be denied.

24:03.490 --> 24:05.425
Total control.

24:09.196 --> 24:11.130
Yeah.

25:08.271 --> 25:10.222
John.

25:10.290 --> 25:12.325
Do you hear something?

25:22.887 --> 25:26.522
Hey there, John.

25:28.592 --> 25:30.559
Ricky said you came back.

25:32.129 --> 25:35.198
I didn't know you get takeout
this far from the city.

25:35.265 --> 25:38.651
- Who the fuck are you?
- Oh, she's got a mouth on her.

25:38.719 --> 25:40.653
<i>What are
you two doin' here?</i>

25:40.721 --> 25:41.575
Huntin'.

25:41.601 --> 25:45.015
Time to get to Big Wallow.
Right, John?

25:50.965 --> 25:54.768
Nice guns.

25:54.835 --> 25:57.503
What is this,
an after-school special?

25:58.956 --> 26:00.990
Well, if we wanna shoot
more than blue jays,

26:01.058 --> 26:03.193
we better get a move on.

26:03.260 --> 26:05.195
Who the hell are you?

26:06.713 --> 26:08.748
Old friends.

26:14.938 --> 26:17.090
Mmm.

26:39.379 --> 26:41.380
How do you guys
like your coffee?

26:41.448 --> 26:43.650
Hot.

26:44.351 --> 26:46.736
- You got any soda?
- In the cooler.

26:58.448 --> 27:01.951
You ain't a dog.
You're a pet.

27:13.480 --> 27:16.348
They said they know
where the hogs are.

27:16.416 --> 27:19.351
John needs a goddamn map
to find his uncle's ranch.

27:22.005 --> 27:24.240
I know where I am now.

27:24.308 --> 27:26.242
We came here to hunt.
Right, Wayne?

27:26.310 --> 27:28.244
This is supposed to be
our weekend.

27:28.312 --> 27:30.846
Come on, didn't you say these
guys are your friends, John?

27:30.914 --> 27:33.616
Once upon a time.
What about us?

27:37.755 --> 27:41.257
Fuck it. Let's go.
Giddyup.

27:45.262 --> 27:47.297
I can handle them.

28:02.629 --> 28:04.664
How do you guys
like your foam?

28:06.867 --> 28:08.835
What are you,
some kinda sway boy?

28:08.902 --> 28:11.587
No.

28:11.655 --> 28:14.056
I was raised
to be a saucier.

28:14.124 --> 28:16.058
A great saucier!

28:16.126 --> 28:18.794
You got any sugar?

28:30.824 --> 28:32.825
Eye-opener?

28:40.884 --> 28:43.269
This is my kinda foam.

28:44.254 --> 28:46.672
Got any of that
other stuff?

28:48.442 --> 28:51.577
Come on, Starbucks.

28:51.645 --> 28:54.947
<i>- Let's get a hunt on.
- We're all going?</i>

29:36.222 --> 29:38.157
Boars...

29:38.224 --> 29:42.127
will only come at you once,
unless they're cornered.

29:42.195 --> 29:44.330
Then they'll keep on comin'.

29:48.869 --> 29:51.103
Now, Ricky,

29:51.171 --> 29:54.557
he got tossed
by a full-tusk devil once.

29:54.625 --> 29:56.425
Ten feet.

29:56.493 --> 29:58.477
Air to ass.

29:59.912 --> 30:03.282
<i>Then it kissed him.</i>

30:03.349 --> 30:05.018
Is that how
you got that scar?

30:08.054 --> 30:10.690
<i>John gave him
that one.</i>

30:10.757 --> 30:13.108
They were playin'
mumbly-peg.

30:13.176 --> 30:16.312
<i>Ricky's buck knife
cut John in the foot,</i>

30:17.831 --> 30:20.133
so he just
slashed it out.

30:20.200 --> 30:22.452
Things even up.

30:23.903 --> 30:27.139
- I got this one in Fallujah.
- Damn!

30:27.207 --> 30:31.243
I'll bet you unloaded a few clips
on those towel-heads.

30:33.230 --> 30:35.497
It ain't no video game
over there.

30:37.500 --> 30:40.436
This here's where
that hog stuck me.

30:40.503 --> 30:43.623
<i>But I got the last laugh.</i>

30:43.690 --> 30:45.841
Why are we stopping?

30:46.910 --> 30:49.278
Showin' off old wounds.

31:37.210 --> 31:39.779
Oh, too much caffeine.

31:40.080 --> 31:43.182
Who made this path?
Shh.

32:01.502 --> 32:05.454
<i>You wanna see what the round we
were usin' in Iraq can do?</i>

32:39.356 --> 32:41.357
What the fuck
are you doing?

32:42.992 --> 32:45.827
What I was trained to do.

32:48.515 --> 32:50.516
Sweet.

32:51.685 --> 32:53.552
You didn't have
to do that.

32:53.619 --> 32:55.587
How do you know?

33:45.405 --> 33:48.341
There's rootin'.
Where?

33:48.408 --> 33:52.010
<i>- Pigs did this?
- Probably in about 10 minutes.</i>

33:52.078 --> 33:54.480
Whoo! It looks
like a rototiller.

33:56.082 --> 33:56.902
<i>Look at that.</i>

33:56.928 --> 33:59.827
<i>Some folks
ain't got no respect.</i>

33:59.869 --> 34:03.605
Maybe they're talkin' about
"Pig-foot." Shut the fuck up, Ben.

34:03.673 --> 34:06.274
Whoa. Touchy.

34:06.343 --> 34:08.777
All right, you know,
let's stop right here.

34:08.844 --> 34:11.880
And see who else
knows how to shoot.

34:11.947 --> 34:13.882
Bring it on.

34:29.366 --> 34:32.667
Boys and their guns. Looks like
an N.R.A. convention.

34:32.735 --> 34:35.304
Hey, we passed
some old oaks.

34:35.371 --> 34:37.851
There might be mushrooms
back on the trail.

34:37.877 --> 34:38.665
Wanna go see?

34:39.626 --> 34:42.043
I'll stay here
at the O.K. Corral.

34:43.413 --> 34:45.130
So who's first?

34:46.933 --> 34:49.534
I'll go.

35:12.642 --> 35:15.244
I think you got within 20
yards on that last one.

35:18.415 --> 35:21.083
You brought a kill gun. And
kill guns are for pussies.

35:21.151 --> 35:24.736
<i>We got our own way of
finishing 'em off up here.</i>

35:24.805 --> 35:27.122
Right, John?

35:27.190 --> 35:29.508
Or ain't that the way
your uncle did it?

35:29.576 --> 35:31.344
<i>He got finished.</i>

35:31.411 --> 35:35.297
What are you gonna do, John?

35:35.365 --> 35:38.300
You gonna cut me?

35:38.368 --> 35:40.335
I ain't 12 no more.

35:40.403 --> 35:43.922
You two can tangle after
we whomp us a pig.

35:44.891 --> 35:46.942
You're up.

35:48.278 --> 35:50.812
We know John can shoot.

36:01.124 --> 36:04.193
What is it, Wolfie?

36:41.364 --> 36:44.683
<i>Oh, God.</i>

36:51.992 --> 36:53.993
Close enough.

36:54.060 --> 36:56.795
Just make sure it's on safety
till we see something.

36:58.331 --> 37:01.133
Can I squeeze off
a few rounds?

37:01.201 --> 37:03.802
You're
not usin' my gun.

37:05.138 --> 37:07.973
I wouldn't want to. Who knows
if the sight's set right?

37:09.009 --> 37:10.859
Do you mind?

37:10.927 --> 37:14.880
You can pull
my trigger any time.

37:16.249 --> 37:19.618
Savage 308.
Cowboy lever action.

37:19.685 --> 37:22.087
Holds five rounds.

37:37.803 --> 37:40.989
That's luck.

37:53.353 --> 37:55.453
Calamity Jane!

37:55.521 --> 37:57.723
Whoo!

38:01.744 --> 38:05.214
Where'd you
learn how to shoot?

38:05.282 --> 38:07.516
You're not the only one
with an uncle.

38:11.121 --> 38:14.924
I just saw some strange shit. Three
huge, giant, half-eaten birds.

38:14.991 --> 38:17.075
- Like a turkey vulture?
- Like a fucking ostrich.

38:17.143 --> 38:19.594
- Was it kinda goony lookin'?
- Goony looking?

38:19.662 --> 38:21.850
I don't know. He was
torn into tartare.

38:21.876 --> 38:22.422
Emus.

38:22.465 --> 38:25.033
Emus? Hippies were
raisin' 'em for meat.

38:25.101 --> 38:27.435
They found out there's
more money in marijuana.

38:27.503 --> 38:30.172
I saw something else too. That
hippie freak from the gas station.

38:30.240 --> 38:32.241
- Where?
- By the dead birds.

38:32.308 --> 38:35.644
Sure that ain't
somethin' else talkin'?

38:35.711 --> 38:39.048
- What would he be doing out here?
- What would tear apart an emu?

38:40.650 --> 38:42.584
They were right here.

38:42.652 --> 38:45.120
Mountain lions
will carry off their prey.

38:45.187 --> 38:49.057
Three at once? Them emus
are as fast as cheetahs.

38:50.893 --> 38:52.861
Looks like
they were tied up.

38:52.928 --> 38:54.863
Mountain lions?

38:54.930 --> 38:57.316
<i>There's bears
around here too.</i>

38:59.219 --> 39:01.587
There's a lot of crazy
shit in these woods.

39:06.492 --> 39:08.927
This is like the
Bataan Death March.

39:08.994 --> 39:11.396
My shoulder's
totally chafed.

39:11.464 --> 39:13.532
How you holdin' up?
Fine.

39:13.600 --> 39:15.534
Nature's StairMaster.

39:15.602 --> 39:19.137
Some say the best part
of hunting is hiking.

39:19.205 --> 39:23.041
The best part of hunting is gettin'
back in the car and goin' home.

39:23.109 --> 39:26.044
<i>Hey! I found
some fresh scat.</i>

39:26.112 --> 39:28.080
What is it?

39:28.147 --> 39:30.415
It's your dog's.

39:30.483 --> 39:33.352
It's Wolfgang's puck.

39:36.539 --> 39:39.474
Wind's all over
the place.

39:39.542 --> 39:43.144
Pigs'll smell us if they're
closing on Big Wallow now.

39:43.212 --> 39:46.181
<i>That storm's gonna push
the wind straight at us.</i>

39:46.516 --> 39:49.818
He's right. We could hit the wallow.
The hogs won't catch our scent.

39:54.090 --> 39:56.158
So what are we gonna do?

39:57.793 --> 40:00.428
Wait for the storm.

40:08.020 --> 40:09.871
Wear this.

40:10.990 --> 40:13.458
I owed ya for them beers.

40:19.666 --> 40:22.066
You look
like a homeless person.

40:22.134 --> 40:26.237
You look like Rambo's
personal fuck bitch.

40:32.278 --> 40:34.045
<i>Can I get a swig of that?</i>

40:37.049 --> 40:39.584
<i>I don't think drinking's
gonna help your aim.</i>

40:43.456 --> 40:45.358
I thought you said you used
to drink with your uncle.

40:45.384 --> 40:46.616
I said my uncle used to drink.

40:46.659 --> 40:48.927
<i>No more than any
other hog hunter.</i>

40:48.994 --> 40:52.230
- Except it killed him.
- It wasn't the whiskey that killed him.

40:52.298 --> 40:54.065
It was the Ripper.

40:54.133 --> 40:56.735
That giant hog the store
owner was talking about?

40:59.655 --> 41:02.140
My uncle went on a bender,
walked out into the woods...

41:02.208 --> 41:04.743
and shot himself.

41:05.911 --> 41:08.597
No man intent on killin'
himself would use a bow--

41:09.999 --> 41:11.650
unless he had to.

41:11.717 --> 41:15.320
- And he was being eaten alive.
- That's trailer trash bullshit.

41:15.388 --> 41:18.590
<i>That ain't exactly
a nice thing to say.</i>

41:18.658 --> 41:21.760
You got Ricky
all riled up.

41:21.827 --> 41:23.762
My uncle drank
a quart of whiskey a day.

41:23.829 --> 41:26.448
Huntin' for weeks on end.

41:26.515 --> 41:29.284
Still fightin'.

41:30.886 --> 41:34.923
- How would you know? You never visited.
- Because I know.

41:36.593 --> 41:40.195
There's no such thing as a Ripper.
Or Hogzilla.

41:40.263 --> 41:42.089
Or whatever else the
fuck you wanna call it.

41:42.115 --> 41:43.290
You callin' me ignorant?

41:43.333 --> 41:45.167
I ain't callin' you anything.

41:53.676 --> 41:56.745
Let's go kill ourselves
a legend.

42:12.812 --> 42:14.979
Quit playin'
with your gun.

42:15.047 --> 42:17.216
I'm just checking it.

42:17.283 --> 42:19.418
You know, that's what
Pee-wee Herman said.

42:19.485 --> 42:23.322
Your I.Q. should be bigger than
the caliber of your gun, Ben.

42:26.058 --> 42:28.993
I don't like this.
I do.

42:29.061 --> 42:32.163
Yeah? You didn't see
those dead birds.

42:32.232 --> 42:34.433
Did you cry when
your goldfish died too, Q-tip?

42:34.500 --> 42:36.535
Oh, go ahead and laugh.

42:36.603 --> 42:40.272
What were those ropes?
That wasn't a mountain lion.

42:40.340 --> 42:42.541
What do you know
about mountain lions?

42:42.609 --> 42:46.511
I know the puma,
the cougar, the panther,

42:46.579 --> 42:49.180
felis concolor.
But you never hunted.

42:49.249 --> 42:52.551
Yeah? Well, I've spent hours
watching the Nature Channel...

42:52.619 --> 42:55.220
while shelling fava beans.
So what?

42:55.288 --> 42:59.358
Whatever killed those birds is a better
hunter than either one of you two,

42:59.425 --> 43:03.729
and he had help.
Look. If it flies, it dies.

43:03.796 --> 43:06.431
Oh, yeah.
Emus don't fly, idiot.

43:06.499 --> 43:08.333
Not dead ones.

43:08.401 --> 43:11.553
Shh!
Big Wallow's on the other side.

43:16.893 --> 43:19.961
Pigs can hardly
see anything at all,

43:20.029 --> 43:23.464
but they got a great sense
of smell and good hearing.

43:23.533 --> 43:25.466
Why are they
wearing cammo?

43:30.823 --> 43:34.493
Oh, whoops.
I didn't see you.

43:34.560 --> 43:37.462
- Q-dick.
- Elmer Fudd.

43:38.964 --> 43:40.816
Stay close.

43:40.883 --> 43:42.984
I wish I had a gun.

44:02.905 --> 44:05.307
We'll flush the perimeter.

44:19.088 --> 44:22.223
Sometimes hogs lay low
in brush and tall grass.

45:32.912 --> 45:34.846
Partridge.

45:35.915 --> 45:38.182
Them's good eatin'.

45:43.155 --> 45:46.174
Oh, God!

46:01.190 --> 46:03.925
Whoa.
Save it for the hogs.

46:03.993 --> 46:06.527
Or maybe this
place is hunted out.

46:06.595 --> 46:09.097
We've never had problems
with poachers--

46:09.165 --> 46:11.199
present company excepted.

46:12.501 --> 46:14.769
Since your uncle died
no one's been up here.

46:14.837 --> 46:17.655
<i>- Including pigs?
- Hogs are here.</i>

46:17.723 --> 46:18.533
Pigs did that?

46:18.559 --> 46:21.684
They rub up against them
scratching their backs.

46:21.727 --> 46:24.545
All right, then what did that?

46:32.871 --> 46:34.639
The Ripper.

46:34.707 --> 46:36.674
No hog's that tall.

46:37.743 --> 46:40.812
Your uncle said
he saw rubbings like that.

46:40.880 --> 46:44.016
John, I wanna go home.

46:44.083 --> 46:45.766
Me too.

46:45.834 --> 46:47.768
Start walking then.

47:05.638 --> 47:07.922
What the hell is he doin'?

47:07.990 --> 47:10.291
It's called
a "California hook."

47:11.593 --> 47:14.946
If he gets in close,

47:15.014 --> 47:17.048
I wanna see
that big pig bleed.

47:23.005 --> 47:27.308
Like I said,
kill guns are for pussies.

47:34.066 --> 47:36.668
Now, what's he got?
A bird call?

47:36.736 --> 47:38.837
Makes the sound
of a piglet in distress.

47:38.905 --> 47:42.741
<i>Any boars in the area
will come charging.</i>

47:43.042 --> 47:48.380
<i>- Fuckin'-A.
- Dig in. I'm callin' that sucker home.</i>

47:48.448 --> 47:52.084
- What are we supposed to do?
- Stay behind me.

47:53.386 --> 47:55.253
And hold on
to that fuckin' dog.

47:58.558 --> 48:01.826
- I want a gun.
- Jiggidy jog.

48:14.440 --> 48:17.825
<i>I definitely want a fucking gun.</i>

48:43.335 --> 48:45.002
My knee!

48:50.209 --> 48:51.976
Wolfgang!

48:52.044 --> 48:53.495
My knee!

48:53.497 --> 48:54.813
Wolfgang!

49:05.524 --> 49:07.659
You made me do it.

49:11.597 --> 49:13.865
<i>- Wolfgang!
- Are you all right?</i>

49:13.933 --> 49:16.718
- It took off my fucking knee!
- We've gotta stop the bleeding.

49:24.477 --> 49:26.411
Oh, kill it. Kill it!

49:30.182 --> 49:32.634
Your head...

49:32.968 --> 49:34.652
on my wall.

49:47.616 --> 49:49.850
Better than aspirin.

49:49.919 --> 49:52.787
Wolfie! Wolfgang!

49:52.854 --> 49:55.957
Let's rest here for a few minutes,
and then we'll get back to camp.

49:56.025 --> 49:59.294
Here, boy! I'm
going to look for him.

49:59.361 --> 50:02.330
Don't go too far. Here.

50:02.398 --> 50:04.732
Take this.

50:10.156 --> 50:13.008
I thought you was a cook.
You must have cut meat.

50:13.075 --> 50:16.444
Meat. Not dead animals.

50:16.512 --> 50:19.714
<i>You'd do good
to find that dog.</i>

50:19.782 --> 50:22.583
He's got more hunter in him
than I gave him credit for.

50:41.370 --> 50:43.454
It ain't got no armor.

50:43.522 --> 50:45.607
What do you mean?

50:46.875 --> 50:50.178
It should be an armor plate
covering his shoulders.

50:50.246 --> 50:52.880
Cartilage,
sometimes an inch thick.

50:52.948 --> 50:56.200
Some collect shrapnel,
like a bulletproof vest.

50:56.268 --> 50:59.037
Like that one
I just popped over there?

50:59.104 --> 51:01.705
It didn't even leave
no blood trail.

51:01.773 --> 51:04.108
I've had bullets bounce off hogs
when I wasn't close enough.

51:04.176 --> 51:07.946
- You need a big bullet.
- So why doesn't this one have armor?

51:09.781 --> 51:13.318
Except for its tusks
and its size,

51:13.385 --> 51:15.386
this looks
like a piglet.

51:26.698 --> 51:28.600
Wolfgang!

51:33.922 --> 51:35.256
Here, boy!

51:38.193 --> 51:40.027
Wolfie, is that you?

52:00.949 --> 52:05.387
<i>Hey, Brooks. You got a
camera on your cell phone?</i>

52:05.454 --> 52:07.121
Take my picture.

52:08.256 --> 52:10.224
Fuck you.

52:10.426 --> 52:14.128
Hey. You wanna see how this is done?
Get in close.

52:14.196 --> 52:16.364
I wouldn't.

52:29.545 --> 52:31.696
<i>That's so foul.</i>

52:31.763 --> 52:34.132
You better get used to it. You
got to dress what you kill.

52:34.200 --> 52:36.267
And you have to shoot
before you kill.

52:36.335 --> 52:38.402
Little dick big gun
didn't fire a shot.

52:38.470 --> 52:40.421
I forgot to cock.

52:47.296 --> 52:49.663
Goddamn!

52:50.665 --> 52:52.166
Look at this shit.

53:02.244 --> 53:05.213
<i>Shh.</i>

53:08.049 --> 53:11.051
What is it?
It don't sound like a hog.

53:13.255 --> 53:15.640
It's the other white meat.

53:15.707 --> 53:17.349
You didn't find Wolfgang?

53:17.375 --> 53:21.053
No, but I found about a
thousand marijuana plants.

53:21.096 --> 53:23.197
- Where?
- A quarter a mile that way.

53:23.265 --> 53:24.866
I'm calling bullshit.

53:27.169 --> 53:29.537
What's this?
Sweet basil?

53:34.610 --> 53:38.329
Holy shit.
This stuff is killer.

53:38.397 --> 53:42.199
- Could you find that place again?
- Oh, you couldn't miss it.

53:42.268 --> 53:44.201
<i>Is it on your
uncle's property?</i>

53:44.270 --> 53:47.171
<i>- Did you cross over a fence?
- No.</i>

53:47.239 --> 53:49.206
I wouldn't mind
filling up a bag.

53:49.275 --> 53:51.276
You know how much that stuff
goes for in the city?

53:51.343 --> 53:52.843
Four grand a pound.

53:52.911 --> 53:55.513
I don't care what it's worth. I don't
want that shit on my property.

53:55.581 --> 53:57.698
<i>- We should at least go check it out.
- Yeah. I wouldn't mind...</i>

53:57.766 --> 54:01.452
<i>taking another look for
Wolfgang, with everybody.</i>

54:02.588 --> 54:04.522
Let's go then.

54:08.927 --> 54:12.863
- Hey, buddy, how you doing?
- Better than him.

54:12.931 --> 54:15.799
You hang
in there, okay?

54:15.867 --> 54:19.069
Let's make this quick. I don't
believe you're leaving your friend.

54:19.138 --> 54:22.873
We're not.
You're staying with him.

54:22.941 --> 54:25.526
Don't forget to bring
your big gun.

54:26.862 --> 54:28.863
Your girl's
got an attitude.

54:28.930 --> 54:31.699
You're telling me. Don't
talk about Brooks.

54:31.767 --> 54:35.102
Shit. We used
to talk about girls.

54:35.170 --> 54:38.539
Remember when you had a
crush on Darlene? Darlene?

54:38.607 --> 54:42.243
My cousin. You used
to bring her candy bars.

54:42.310 --> 54:45.480
Is there much family resemblance?
No.

54:45.547 --> 54:49.417
She's got red on the head
like a dick on a dog.

54:49.485 --> 54:52.387
<i>Just like old times.</i>

54:53.489 --> 54:55.490
Isn't old times.

55:12.090 --> 55:16.928
You know, uh, Ben didn't want
you coming on this trip.

55:16.995 --> 55:19.130
I gathered that.

55:19.198 --> 55:21.465
That fucker-- I mean,

55:21.533 --> 55:25.303
he's never hunted
a day in his life.

55:25.370 --> 55:27.571
And he's always
talking shit, you know?

55:27.639 --> 55:29.874
He's never
done anything.

55:29.942 --> 55:32.710
You know, I got him
his fucking job.

55:32.777 --> 55:34.946
You should try to relax.

55:35.013 --> 55:37.114
Thanks, Brooks.

55:37.182 --> 55:39.516
Don't mention it.

55:43.088 --> 55:45.356
It could be them
coming back.

55:53.832 --> 55:56.133
Holy high times!

55:59.905 --> 56:02.139
This is a professional
operation.

56:03.942 --> 56:06.143
So are we.

56:07.246 --> 56:09.881
Oh, that's
a lot of raincoats.

56:09.948 --> 56:13.317
That's food for the year,
a new truck.

56:13.385 --> 56:15.353
Look. Our friend's
been here.

56:17.906 --> 56:20.257
Okay, we need to get back
and call the authorities.

56:20.325 --> 56:23.494
Bullshit. You think we came
out here to hunt hogs...

56:23.562 --> 56:26.064
or to wish you
a happy homecoming?

56:26.131 --> 56:29.433
- Ricky, quit cutting that dope.
- Shit, you gonna make me?

56:29.501 --> 56:32.103
You gonna stop
what you're doing now.

56:32.170 --> 56:34.087
My ass.

56:36.608 --> 56:38.676
Now we're even.

56:40.779 --> 56:44.949
Ricky, put the knife down.

57:37.702 --> 57:39.620
He was gonna shoot you.

57:45.493 --> 57:47.494
You killed my brother.

57:57.022 --> 57:59.323
My family's
gonna make you pay.

58:05.397 --> 58:07.598
You're all gonna die.

58:11.253 --> 58:14.505
You-- You think
they got another hog?

58:14.573 --> 58:17.608
Sounded like
Ben's magnum.

58:17.676 --> 58:20.511
Well, then they
didn't get another hog.

58:31.990 --> 58:33.991
Give me your rifle.

58:48.857 --> 58:50.691
Don't shoot.
Don't shoot.

58:53.895 --> 58:58.065
- Ricky's dead.
- Ben shot Ricky.

58:58.217 --> 58:59.784
- What?
- He was gonna kill you.

59:00.202 --> 59:02.687
Jake went to get his clan. We've
got to get out of here fast.

59:02.754 --> 59:05.323
Can you move?

59:05.390 --> 59:07.677
You and I can run back to
your uncle's and get help.

59:07.703 --> 59:08.651
There's no phone.

59:08.694 --> 59:11.879
We'll take the S.U.V. to town. Okay,
we need to make a stretcher for Wayne,

59:11.947 --> 59:13.530
and get back to my uncle's
as best we can.

59:13.599 --> 59:15.996
<i>- What if the hillbillies
get there first?</i>

59:16.022 --> 59:17.693
<i>- We are wasting time.</i>

59:18.636 --> 59:21.321
Give me one of those guns.

59:23.625 --> 59:26.543
Do you have any more ammo?

59:26.611 --> 59:28.496
We left our bags.

59:28.564 --> 59:30.631
What about yours?

59:31.683 --> 59:33.551
Come on.

59:38.190 --> 59:40.191
You've got four shots.

59:42.110 --> 59:45.062
Come on, Q.
We got to hustle.

59:49.101 --> 59:50.802
Wolfgang!

59:50.869 --> 59:53.621
You yell for that dog again,
I'll kill you myself.

59:53.688 --> 59:57.224
- I need to find him.
- I don't want them to find us.

59:57.291 --> 59:59.292
Oh! Are we even going
the right way?

59:59.360 --> 01:00:01.361
I think we passed
the same tree twice.

01:00:01.429 --> 01:00:03.196
What tree?

01:00:04.399 --> 01:00:08.135
Uh, what do we use for
the middle that'll hold?

01:00:09.504 --> 01:00:11.505
Ricky and Jake's canvas bags
would be perfect.

01:00:11.573 --> 01:00:13.574
Well, how far are they?

01:00:13.642 --> 01:00:16.861
Pretty close. I don't think
we'll have enough time.

01:00:16.928 --> 01:00:20.130
We'll gain time
if we make a scoop stretcher.

01:00:20.198 --> 01:00:22.500
I think there's extra
ammo in those bags too.

01:00:22.567 --> 01:00:25.302
Don't leave me.
You'll be okay.

01:00:25.370 --> 01:00:27.371
You got your rifle.

01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:30.741
Then run fast.

01:00:37.382 --> 01:00:39.783
Oh, can we slow down?

01:00:39.851 --> 01:00:43.620
You don't know where you're going.
Any road will get you there.

01:00:43.688 --> 01:00:45.689
I know where I'm going.

01:00:48.493 --> 01:00:50.311
Oh! Oh!

01:00:50.378 --> 01:00:53.247
Oh, just give me a second.

01:00:53.315 --> 01:00:55.616
Do you know
how to use that thing?

01:00:57.119 --> 01:00:59.953
You squeeze
the trigger, right?

01:01:00.021 --> 01:01:03.290
Yeah. That's about it.

01:01:03.358 --> 01:01:06.127
We're not gonna have
to shoot anybody.

01:01:08.029 --> 01:01:10.498
We already have
shot somebody.

01:01:14.702 --> 01:01:16.770
John?
Yeah?

01:01:16.838 --> 01:01:18.905
Next time you want
a wildlife adventure,

01:01:18.973 --> 01:01:22.276
could we just fuck in the
bushes at Golden Gate Park?

01:01:40.512 --> 01:01:42.846
Oh, fuck you.

01:01:43.048 --> 01:01:45.699
I ain't dead yet.

01:01:51.039 --> 01:01:52.989
Unbelievable.

01:01:53.058 --> 01:01:55.843
And that's not all.
Ricky's gone.

01:01:55.910 --> 01:01:58.829
What do you mean? His body
was here and he was dead.

01:02:00.898 --> 01:02:05.436
<i>And that sign--
Somebody put it back up.</i>

01:02:13.245 --> 01:02:15.462
John?

01:02:17.498 --> 01:02:19.432
Brooks?

01:02:21.302 --> 01:02:23.303
Who's there?

01:02:25.073 --> 01:02:27.741
What is it?

01:02:27.809 --> 01:02:30.310
Looks like
a cow or a horse.

01:02:30.378 --> 01:02:32.579
But it's hard to tell
in this muck.

01:02:56.404 --> 01:02:58.388
Wolfie!

01:03:18.626 --> 01:03:20.294
Get your guns.

01:03:20.362 --> 01:03:23.297
What the hell's the matter, Jake?
They killed Ricky.

01:03:23.365 --> 01:03:25.582
God, no! Who done it?
Who done it?

01:03:25.650 --> 01:03:28.436
John Hickman and his city friends!
Son of a bitch!

01:03:28.503 --> 01:03:33.040
Son of a bitch! Get your shit, boys!
Get your shit, boys!

01:03:46.237 --> 01:03:50.023
<i>Darlene,
get the dogs.</i>

01:04:03.388 --> 01:04:07.324
Darlene, shut the fuck up
and get the goddamn dogs!

01:04:31.048 --> 01:04:33.049
What's going on?

01:04:51.135 --> 01:04:54.405
Those are horse tracks.
Maybe somebody carried him out of here.

01:04:54.472 --> 01:04:57.208
He would've
waited for us.

01:04:57.275 --> 01:04:59.443
What was that gunshot?

01:04:59.511 --> 01:05:01.445
Other hunters?

01:05:02.447 --> 01:05:04.415
That's what
I'm afraid of.

01:05:04.483 --> 01:05:07.784
Yeehaw! Whoo!

01:05:29.274 --> 01:05:32.526
I told you. I knew
where I was going.

01:05:33.528 --> 01:05:37.280
Hey, Wolfie.
Wolfie, come here, boy.

01:05:47.692 --> 01:05:49.627
<i>We don't have time
for this.</i>

01:05:53.765 --> 01:05:55.699
Oh, God!

01:05:55.767 --> 01:05:59.436
Who would do this to a poor,
defenseless dog?

01:06:02.841 --> 01:06:05.242
The same inbreds
who are gonna do it to us.

01:07:08.290 --> 01:07:11.224
They've locked us in!

01:07:15.714 --> 01:07:17.715
We got to get out of here!

01:07:31.979 --> 01:07:33.864
This is it!

01:07:40.154 --> 01:07:41.955
Climb through!

01:09:00.167 --> 01:09:02.102
I didn't do anything.

01:09:09.911 --> 01:09:11.978
You killed my dog!

01:09:20.587 --> 01:09:22.337
Motherfucker.

01:09:51.102 --> 01:09:55.138
Do it. Shoot me.

01:09:55.206 --> 01:09:58.375
Kill guns are for pussies.

01:10:04.749 --> 01:10:08.385
Oh, hell. Oh, hell.

01:10:34.612 --> 01:10:37.047
Let us pray, boys.

01:10:37.115 --> 01:10:41.285
"Vengeance is mine."
So saith the Lord.

01:11:08.879 --> 01:11:11.798
Please don't kill me.

01:11:11.866 --> 01:11:14.267
I'm not a hunter.

01:11:17.071 --> 01:11:19.172
You're right.

01:11:20.508 --> 01:11:23.977
You're the hunted.

01:12:07.405 --> 01:12:10.373
Wow. Second bite
of Rocky Road.

01:12:10.441 --> 01:12:13.476
You really know
how to woo a girl.

01:12:16.447 --> 01:12:20.383
We're not gonna find Wayne.
Not alive.

01:12:20.451 --> 01:12:23.553
I think we should go back to Big
Wallow and wait for Ben and Quincy.

01:12:23.621 --> 01:12:25.922
We're not gonna
leave Wayne behind.

01:12:34.933 --> 01:12:37.834
These are the last days.

01:12:39.219 --> 01:12:41.671
They crossed the line.

01:12:55.069 --> 01:12:57.170
And we're
on the other side.

01:13:03.894 --> 01:13:07.714
You two get to that hippie
commune if they go there first.

01:13:09.517 --> 01:13:12.135
The rest of us
will get to Big Wallow.

01:13:13.420 --> 01:13:16.055
<i>Hello again.</i>

01:13:16.123 --> 01:13:18.091
I heard shots.

01:13:19.477 --> 01:13:21.545
This is
my uncle's property.

01:13:21.612 --> 01:13:23.914
What are you doing here?
I live near here,

01:13:23.981 --> 01:13:26.282
over on
Feather Springs commune.

01:13:26.350 --> 01:13:29.052
I don't like gunfire
too close.

01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:31.705
We try to be nonviolent.
Then what's that for?

01:13:31.772 --> 01:13:34.207
One of our animals
is loose.

01:13:34.274 --> 01:13:37.177
I'm trying to find him before
trigger-happy hunters kill him first.

01:13:37.244 --> 01:13:40.279
- Do you have a phone?
- Are you lost?

01:13:40.347 --> 01:13:42.282
We need help.
One of our friends is missing.

01:13:42.349 --> 01:13:44.384
<i>There's a shortwave radio
back at the main house.</i>

01:13:44.451 --> 01:13:48.071
Can we get the police? You
can call whoever you want.

01:13:49.723 --> 01:13:51.791
Is there trouble?

01:13:53.544 --> 01:13:55.879
There might be.

01:13:55.947 --> 01:13:57.881
Follow me.

01:15:16.894 --> 01:15:19.663
So what have you
killed so far?

01:15:19.730 --> 01:15:21.698
<i>Nothing.
That's funny.</i>

01:15:21.766 --> 01:15:23.700
<i>I saw a hog with
his head cut off.</i>

01:15:23.768 --> 01:15:25.802
<i>Yeah? Where did you see that?</i>

01:15:25.870 --> 01:15:27.804
Maybe it was just
my imagination.

01:15:27.872 --> 01:15:30.907
You have any cows or horses?
We raise emus.

01:15:30.975 --> 01:15:33.577
- Not for meat though.
- For what then?

01:15:33.644 --> 01:15:35.845
We use the feathers
to stuff pillows.

01:15:35.913 --> 01:15:38.548
You herd emus
with a cattle prod?

01:15:38.616 --> 01:15:41.417
This is for big
livestock.

01:16:15.069 --> 01:16:18.037
- Where am I?
- With us.

01:16:22.543 --> 01:16:26.680
- Relax.
- We're gonna take good care of you.

01:16:26.747 --> 01:16:28.381
My shoulder.

01:17:37.501 --> 01:17:40.036
Ricky was right here.

01:17:40.103 --> 01:17:42.839
They must be heading
for those hippies.

01:17:42.907 --> 01:17:47.476
I ain't
buryin' just my brother.

01:17:52.049 --> 01:17:54.050
It'll be good
for your shoulder,

01:17:54.117 --> 01:17:56.786
and it will leave
less of a scar.

01:17:59.523 --> 01:18:01.891
Ooh.

01:18:01.959 --> 01:18:05.461
Can I get another hit?
Of course.

01:19:02.552 --> 01:19:04.787
<i>What about the cops?</i>

01:19:04.855 --> 01:19:06.789
Everything
is taken care of.

01:19:50.801 --> 01:19:52.735
A trough.

01:19:52.803 --> 01:19:55.672
Slop for the pigs.

01:19:55.739 --> 01:19:57.940
That's pigs?

01:19:58.008 --> 01:20:01.144
It's the sulfur minerals
in the mud.

01:20:01.211 --> 01:20:03.246
It's medicinal.

01:20:10.254 --> 01:20:14.190
How come you feeding the pigs
so close to the house?

01:20:26.520 --> 01:20:28.455
What the fuck.

01:20:37.264 --> 01:20:39.199
Wayne?

01:20:46.974 --> 01:20:50.110
It's eating me.

01:20:54.381 --> 01:20:58.451
Your
friends on wheels?

01:21:04.408 --> 01:21:06.943
It's the Tibbs.
Don't be scared.

01:21:07.011 --> 01:21:10.046
Be cool. Drop 'em
like they're beer cans.

01:21:14.735 --> 01:21:16.202
Fuck you, rednecks.

01:21:35.839 --> 01:21:37.440
Get some.

01:21:47.918 --> 01:21:50.520
Tied-dyed, pussi-fied.

01:21:51.855 --> 01:21:53.289
What's goin' on, O.J.?

01:22:15.395 --> 01:22:18.147
Save it!

01:22:19.516 --> 01:22:21.584
Creep, sweep.

01:22:52.799 --> 01:22:54.833
Come on,
you pussel-gutted bastard!

01:22:54.901 --> 01:22:57.370
You sweet son of a bitch.

01:23:40.964 --> 01:23:43.900
Please, help me.

01:24:10.794 --> 01:24:14.030
We need help.
Where's your shortwave radio?

01:24:14.098 --> 01:24:17.200
- What shortwave radio?
- Where's that hippie freak?

01:24:17.267 --> 01:24:20.402
- I don't know who you're talking about.
- Where's our friend?

01:24:20.470 --> 01:24:22.238
- What friend?
- That's Ben's gun.

01:24:22.305 --> 01:24:25.041
- What gun?
- The gun on the table.

01:24:25.242 --> 01:24:26.859
What table?

01:24:26.926 --> 01:24:29.111
<i>I wouldn't do that.</i>

01:24:37.921 --> 01:24:40.756
T.J.

01:24:40.824 --> 01:24:42.758
Jake!

01:24:47.197 --> 01:24:50.633
Lord have mercy.

01:25:12.272 --> 01:25:14.640
- No way.
- That's just what your uncle said.

01:25:14.708 --> 01:25:16.809
God!

01:25:16.877 --> 01:25:19.645
<i>We'll save
that one for later.</i>

01:25:19.713 --> 01:25:23.783
What about the others outside?
They're meeting their master.

01:25:25.452 --> 01:25:27.753
You've got another destiny.

01:25:32.059 --> 01:25:34.060
Mud me.

01:25:43.369 --> 01:25:46.872
Nicole Giddens.

01:25:49.309 --> 01:25:51.243
You lost?

01:25:52.712 --> 01:25:55.548
Kelly McDonald,
Leggett, California.

01:25:55.615 --> 01:25:58.717
<i>What is this place?
Jennifer Chadwick.</i>

01:26:18.588 --> 01:26:20.222
Where are they?

01:26:21.441 --> 01:26:23.475
Where's who?

01:26:29.449 --> 01:26:32.518
I'd say you got two choices.

01:26:57.477 --> 01:26:59.044
No!

01:27:13.994 --> 01:27:16.328
That's the spirit.

01:27:27.140 --> 01:27:30.175
- Take it off.
- Leave her alone!

01:27:41.087 --> 01:27:44.356
Does this make you feel like a man?
Oh, yeah.

01:27:45.692 --> 01:27:48.527
You're a beautiful
sacrifice.

01:27:53.934 --> 01:27:56.435
What are you doing?

01:27:59.039 --> 01:28:02.140
<i>What's out there?</i>

01:28:15.254 --> 01:28:17.556
You're gonna
rot in here.

01:28:18.592 --> 01:28:20.626
Then in hell.

01:28:20.694 --> 01:28:23.061
What the--

01:28:46.837 --> 01:28:48.671
Jesus fuck.

01:28:53.376 --> 01:28:55.645
Life is meant
to be awesome.

01:29:02.386 --> 01:29:06.622
<i>Camille
Cook, Carmel, California.</i>

01:29:17.467 --> 01:29:22.137
California, California,
California, California.

01:29:29.896 --> 01:29:34.900
Calm down, John.
Relax and squeeze.

01:29:38.204 --> 01:29:40.706
How does it feel to be
so low on the food chain?

01:29:54.170 --> 01:29:59.041
You can't hurt him.

01:30:20.463 --> 01:30:22.898
Heel, boy.

01:30:56.166 --> 01:30:59.418
<i>- Brooks, stand still!
He can't see you!</i>

01:33:51.808 --> 01:33:53.742
You okay?

01:33:58.831 --> 01:34:00.832
Mission accomplished.
