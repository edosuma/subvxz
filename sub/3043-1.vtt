You think it's
all honor and glory.

02:21.800 --> 02:23.300
Well it's not.

02:24.700 --> 02:27.800
I've done some things

some forbearance.

05:55.900 --> 05:58.600
I am in your debt
My Lord. As always.

05:58.700 --> 06:00.600
And you may repay it

06:01.100 --> 06:04.400
by sending your boy
to the Scorpions for training.

06:04.500 --> 06:07.600
If he makes half the mercenary
his father was

06:08.100 --> 06:10.300
he'll serve the nation well.

06:16.200 --> 06:18.200
You will pay for this.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.200
I promise.

10:04.500 --> 10:06.400
You have trained hard.

may send you.

11:19.100 --> 11:21.800
He eats Enki's portions
as well as his own.

11:21.900 --> 11:24.300
Where is Enki?
Why didn't he come?

11:24.600 --> 11:26.700
He ran away
from home last year.

11:26.800 --> 11:28.700
He's left to
find his fortune.

11:28.800 --> 11:30.400
He'll be back.

11:37.400 --> 11:40.600
Well well look at the proud new
Black Scorpion.

Do I know you?

13:18.500 --> 13:20.200
I think not Sire.

13:21.200 --> 13:23.000
Ashur was his father.

13:23.100 --> 13:24.200
Ah.

13:25.900 --> 13:29.100
Your father was a skillful warrior
and a patriot.

13:29.400 --> 13:31.900
I trust you will
honor his memory.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.900
Send him to
the palace later.

There's no place for timidity now that
the scorpion rides on your shoulder.

16:08.700 --> 16:11.300
You're wondering
about their tattoos.

16:11.700 --> 16:14.200
One for each man
they've slain.

16:16.600 --> 16:18.600
You'd like a few of your own
wouldn't you?

16:21.400 --> 16:25.100
If they deserve
to die yes.

16:25.600 --> 16:27.100
We all deserve to die.

16:27.200 --> 16:30.000
The only question is in what manner
and how soon.

16:30.100 --> 16:31.800
As a member of
my personal bodyguard

16:31.900 --> 16:36.100
it'll be your job to insure that you
die long before I do.

16:38.500 --> 16:40.400
Your personal bodyguard?

16:40.400 --> 16:42.700
It's a great honor
Mathayus.

16:44.000 --> 16:46.800
Beyond the skill and strength
I'm told you possess

16:46.900 --> 16:51.000
the first requirement is an absolute and
unwavering loyalty to me

16:51.500 --> 16:52.900
your king.

16:55.400 --> 16:57.300
Show him what I mean.

16:58.800 --> 17:00.300
Hail Sargon!

17:05.200 --> 17:08.099
Are you capable
of such loyalty Mathayus?

17:08.599 --> 17:09.599
I...

17:14.599 --> 17:15.700
Yes

17:16.099 --> 17:17.300
Sire.

17:17.800 --> 17:20.800
Good.
Then riches and glory will be yours.

17:22.200 --> 17:25.400
But Mathayus
betray me even once

17:25.400 --> 17:28.400
and you will pray to the gods
for a quick death.

I like you Mathayus.

18:50.100 --> 18:52.100
Bring in the prisoner.

18:52.900 --> 18:55.500
He was overheard
slandering my name.

18:58.600 --> 19:01.100
And the punishment is death.

19:03.300 --> 19:05.500
Wait. But this is my...
I know.

Did you slander the king?

Mathayus! Please!

19:28.600 --> 19:29.700
Answer me!

Are the charges true?

Yes.

25:28.200 --> 25:31.100
First of all
I am not following you around.

25:31.200 --> 25:32.900
I'm escaping too.

25:33.300 --> 25:37.200
My parents pledged my hand to that fat
sheep merchant Muktil.

25:37.600 --> 25:39.300
We're due to be
married in a week.

25:39.400 --> 25:41.000
(CHUCKLES) Congratulations.

25:41.900 --> 25:43.100
You think it's funny.

25:43.200 --> 25:46.600
Well I don't know who smells worse
him or his sheep.

25:47.100 --> 25:50.200
Mathayus I just want
a life of adventure.

25:50.800 --> 25:52.700
And battle.
Like a man.

25:53.200 --> 25:55.300
There's one small problem.

25:55.600 --> 25:57.100
You're not a man.

25:57.200 --> 25:58.500
Thanks for noticing.

25:59.400 --> 26:00.600
Hey!

26:01.100 --> 26:03.600
I heard you tried
to kill Sargon.

26:03.700 --> 26:07.200
Hey listen.
I will kill that bastard some day.

26:07.700 --> 26:09.900
Everyone knows he makes sacrifices
to the dark gods

26:10.000 --> 26:12.000
and they've given him
black magical powers.

26:12.100 --> 26:14.100
You're gonna need
all the help you can get.

26:14.200 --> 26:16.000
Layla that's nice but a girl would
only get in the way.

26:16.100 --> 26:17.200
I'm not just a girl.

26:17.300 --> 26:20.300
Look we're not kids anymore
playing games.

26:20.400 --> 26:22.800
I see your Black Scorpion training
also included lessons

26:22.800 --> 26:24.700
on how to become
an arrogant jerk.

26:24.800 --> 26:27.800
Congratulations on passing
with flying colors.

26:29.200 --> 26:32.200
Go home Layla.
Make the sheep merchant's life miserable.

26:32.300 --> 26:35.600
Fine! If that's how you want it.
You're on your own.

26:35.900 --> 26:37.300
Fine.
Fine.

26:46.100 --> 26:48.000
Ticket to Egypt please.
Ten pieces.

26:48.100 --> 26:49.500
Ticket to Egypt for one.

26:49.500 --> 26:51.000
Ten pieces.

26:51.600 --> 26:53.500
Ten? That's pretty steep.

26:53.500 --> 26:55.400
Plus one for insurance.

26:55.400 --> 26:57.600
And I highly recommend it
because there are pirates

26:57.600 --> 27:00.200
hostile natives
and hurricanes.

27:01.200 --> 27:02.900
Just the ticket.

27:06.400 --> 27:08.700
Piracy has already
started if you ask me.

27:08.800 --> 27:10.300
Egypt. For one.

27:10.400 --> 27:11.600
Ten pieces.

27:15.400 --> 27:17.000
Pardon me.
Excuse me.

27:17.100 --> 27:18.200
Don't push in!

27:18.300 --> 27:19.500
What are you
talking about?

27:19.500 --> 27:21.400
I left the line for 10 seconds
to relieve my bladder.

27:21.400 --> 27:23.000
Liar. Greek.

27:23.400 --> 27:27.600
Madam I would caution you
never to mix those two words together.

27:28.700 --> 27:30.000
Cretin.

27:31.400 --> 27:33.800
To the land of the pharaohs
my good man.

27:33.900 --> 27:35.300
Ten pieces.

27:39.400 --> 27:40.700
Ticket.

27:56.800 --> 27:58.700
You are following me.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.200
Admit it.

28:00.300 --> 28:02.600
You know this may come
as a shock to you

28:02.600 --> 28:06.100
but not everything
in the world happens because of you.

28:06.100 --> 28:07.700
Then why are you
going to Egypt?

28:07.800 --> 28:09.100
Because...

28:09.700 --> 28:13.700
Everyone should go and see the pyramids
once in their lives.

28:14.200 --> 28:16.500
Why are you going to Egypt?

28:17.100 --> 28:18.300
Personal matters

28:18.700 --> 28:20.800
which don't concern you.

28:21.100 --> 28:25.100
Don't play coy with me.
You know I'll get it out of you anyway.

28:28.400 --> 28:29.400
All right.

28:29.500 --> 28:32.800
My father once fought for the pharaoh's
private guard and saved his life.

28:32.900 --> 28:35.400
So I'm going to ask if in return
he'll let me borrow

28:35.500 --> 28:38.500
the Spear of Osiris
to help me defeat Sargon.

28:39.300 --> 28:41.400
The Pharaoh of Egypt

28:42.600 --> 28:45.400
is going to lend one of the most
fabled weapons in history

28:45.500 --> 28:48.500
to a 19-year-old kid
he's never even heard of?

28:49.100 --> 28:50.400
I don't remember
asking your opinion.

28:50.500 --> 28:52.100
Actually

28:52.600 --> 28:55.500
I'm afraid she's right.
It wouldn't work.

28:56.400 --> 28:59.200
But mainly for the simple reason
that the Spear of Osiris

28:59.200 --> 29:02.100
is only effective
against Egyptian monsters.

29:02.200 --> 29:05.700
Such as the winged scarab
sphinxes and cursed mummies.

29:07.000 --> 29:09.000
And you know this how?

29:09.500 --> 29:12.100
Let's just say
I'm well connected.

29:12.200 --> 29:14.500
Really? And who
are you exactly?

29:15.700 --> 29:17.900
Aristophanes of Naxos.

29:18.000 --> 29:21.700
Not to be confused with the Aristophanes
from Corinth. That hack.

29:21.700 --> 29:24.700
I speak 20 languages fluently
and another 20 passably.

29:24.800 --> 29:26.700
So if you need
any translation services...

29:26.700 --> 29:29.900
Yes yes. How did you learn
about the Spear of Osiris?

29:30.000 --> 29:33.400
I am a poet and playwright by trade
and sometimes a musician.

29:33.400 --> 29:37.100
And was most recently
court poet to the king of Elam.

29:38.400 --> 29:42.300
Petty despot. May he rot in the
underworld for his lack of esthetic taste.

29:42.300 --> 29:45.500
And learned of it from one of
his high priests.

29:45.600 --> 29:48.600
But you are thinking
along the right path.

29:49.000 --> 29:52.400
To defeat a man like Sargon
well-versed in the black arts

29:52.400 --> 29:55.300
one would require
a potent weapon indeed.

29:56.800 --> 29:57.900
Like?

29:58.500 --> 29:59.900
Let's see.

30:00.400 --> 30:03.200
There's the Hammer of Zeus.
No too unwieldy.

30:03.200 --> 30:05.900
The Shield of Cronos.
That's completely discredited.

30:06.000 --> 30:07.300
The Cloak of...

30:07.400 --> 30:11.900
I've got it!
The Sword of Damocles!

30:13.000 --> 30:14.200
The what?

30:14.300 --> 30:16.200
Damocles. You know.

30:18.400 --> 30:19.900
The one condemned to die
a thousand deaths

30:20.000 --> 30:23.800
by the very hand of the sword that he used
to kill King Philpman.

30:25.300 --> 30:26.700
(GROANS)

30:26.900 --> 30:29.700
What do they teach you
in Akkadian schools these days?

30:29.800 --> 30:32.200
Not to touch
other men's swords.

30:32.700 --> 30:34.800
Well in any case

30:34.800 --> 30:37.800
according to Book Five of
Herodotus' <i>Histories</i>

30:37.900 --> 30:41.800
Damocles' infamous sword was transformed
by a lightning bolt from Zeus

30:41.900 --> 30:45.900
into a wondrous weapon whose blade
could cut through anything.

30:46.000 --> 30:48.000
Mortal or immortal.

30:48.100 --> 30:51.600
And presented as a gift
to the Queen of the Underworld.

30:51.700 --> 30:54.500
You're saying this sword
can cut through anything?

30:54.600 --> 30:56.000
Oh please.

30:56.700 --> 30:58.000
Anything.

30:59.300 --> 31:01.600
And you know
where this sword is?

31:01.700 --> 31:04.300
This has to be the most harebrained
scheme I've heard yet today

31:04.400 --> 31:06.500
and that is saying plenty.

31:06.600 --> 31:08.900
Oh and you
have a better idea.

31:11.200 --> 31:13.000
Okay. I've decided.

31:13.900 --> 31:16.600
We're gonna continue
on our journey to Knossos.

31:16.700 --> 31:19.800
And you're gonna lead me
to the Sword of Damocles.

31:19.900 --> 31:23.500
My friend such a journey would be
fraught with perils.

31:23.600 --> 31:26.600
The Underworld is a grim and
dangerous place of condemned souls

31:26.700 --> 31:27.700
suffering unspeakable...

31:27.800 --> 31:29.800
How much do you want?

31:29.800 --> 31:33.000
Exclusive rights to compose
an epic ode of your quest

31:33.000 --> 31:35.100
and one hundred silver staters
for expenses.

31:35.100 --> 31:36.200
Wait. A hundred?

31:36.300 --> 31:38.900
For risking my life
it's a pittance.

31:42.900 --> 31:46.100
A lady doesn't part
with her dowry that easily.

31:46.600 --> 31:47.600
Here we go.

31:47.700 --> 31:49.400
First of all
I'm coming along.

31:49.500 --> 31:50.600
Wait. Forget it.

31:50.700 --> 31:54.300
Second you will treat me with respect
and as your equal.

31:54.700 --> 31:56.700
If not your superior.

32:04.500 --> 32:09.000
LAYLA: Thirty-fifth you will launder my
undergarments daily in fresh rosewater.

32:10.300 --> 32:14.900
Forty-seventh you will bathe and
rub my feet with olive oil once a day.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.500
Don't push it.

32:18.500 --> 32:19.800
Hey Greek.

32:19.900 --> 32:21.100
Call me Ari my sweet.

32:21.200 --> 32:23.300
In case you get any funny ideas
about losing us

32:23.400 --> 32:25.500
or making off with my money
just remember this.

32:25.600 --> 32:28.500
Akkadian women are just as handy with
a dagger as Akkadian men.

32:28.600 --> 32:31.800
I'm sure that's not the only thing
you're handy at fair maiden

32:31.900 --> 32:35.100
whose beauty makes even
goddesses blush with envy.

32:35.100 --> 32:37.800
Hey save your flowery words
for your scribblings.

32:37.900 --> 32:39.500
Focus on the task at hand

32:39.600 --> 32:42.200
which is getting
us into that.

32:44.600 --> 32:45.900
Alive.

32:49.300 --> 32:50.700
Of course.

33:17.600 --> 33:20.100
(WHISPERING) Perhaps Layla here might use
her feminine wiles

33:20.200 --> 33:23.400
to distract the guards
whilst we slip past them.

33:30.000 --> 33:31.400
This I have to see.

33:31.500 --> 33:33.700
Hi boys.
Nice night isn't it?

33:33.700 --> 33:35.400
GUARD: Concubines around back.

33:39.600 --> 33:41.400
Nice.
She is quite the charmer

33:41.400 --> 33:42.500
isn't she?

33:48.300 --> 33:50.400
You should see her
in a bad mood.

33:50.600 --> 33:51.600
Hmm.

33:51.700 --> 33:52.900
LAYLA: Guys!

33:53.400 --> 33:55.100
Come on let's go.

34:00.400 --> 34:02.700
These keys
should get us into the palace.

34:02.800 --> 34:04.800
But then we need
to find the labyrinth.

34:04.900 --> 34:07.600
The portal to the Underworld
lies within the labyrinth.

34:07.700 --> 34:09.000
Get down!

34:09.900 --> 34:11.800
(GUARDS CHATTERING)

34:18.100 --> 34:19.400
Let's go.

34:24.100 --> 34:26.100
GUARD: Intruders
in the palace!

34:26.300 --> 34:27.199
Stop them!

34:29.800 --> 34:30.800
Intruders!

34:41.699 --> 34:42.699
LAYLA: Hurry up.

34:42.800 --> 34:44.100
Come on.
Come on.

34:47.100 --> 34:48.699
I'm in!

34:49.199 --> 34:50.500
LAYLA: Come on!

34:51.500 --> 34:52.800
Come on!

34:54.300 --> 34:56.199
Ow! Watch your sword.

34:56.300 --> 34:57.400
ARI: I think
I've found something.

34:57.500 --> 34:58.500
I think it's a lever.

34:58.600 --> 34:59.700
MATHAYUS: Hey
don't touch that.

34:59.800 --> 35:02.700
(ALL SCREAMING)

35:18.700 --> 35:19.800
Are you all right?

35:19.900 --> 35:20.900
Yeah.

35:22.300 --> 35:24.500
I'm fine too. Thank you.

35:26.200 --> 35:28.000
Who are you people?

35:31.700 --> 35:34.000
Why are you imprisoned here?

captives from many lands.

36:05.800 --> 36:08.400
All brought here
to be fed to the Minotaur.

36:08.400 --> 36:09.700
The what?

36:10.500 --> 36:14.100
What do I expect from people who write
on clay tablets?

36:18.300 --> 36:19.900
The Minotaur.

36:20.900 --> 36:23.500
A creature
half man half bull.

36:23.900 --> 36:28.300
A crazed monster whose appetite must
be satisfied daily with human flesh.

36:29.500 --> 36:32.500
King Minos believes that the Minotaur
protects the city

36:32.600 --> 36:34.000
and as long as it lives

36:34.100 --> 36:37.600
his reign will be secure
and the people will prosper.

36:39.100 --> 36:41.000
And you were
going to tell us when?

36:41.100 --> 36:42.700
(ROARING)

36:49.400 --> 36:51.600
At the appropriate moment.

36:51.700 --> 36:55.500
Speak up sooner next time.
We don't even know who this guy is.

36:58.000 --> 37:00.900
Who will join me
in battling this monster?

sit here in terror

37:24.300 --> 37:26.200
and squeeze out a few more
wretched days of life

37:26.200 --> 37:28.400
than die fighting honorably
for a chance at freedom?

37:28.400 --> 37:33.100
My friend you are wasting your breath.
Most men are slaves to their fears.

37:33.600 --> 37:35.500

37:35.600 --> 37:36.900
(STAMMERS)

37:37.400 --> 37:39.800
I would just
get in the way.

37:39.800 --> 37:41.200
No doubt.

37:49.900 --> 37:51.900
MATHAYUS: At least
she came strapped.

37:52.000 --> 37:53.100
Nice.

38:03.100 --> 38:04.300
This way.

38:14.900 --> 38:16.400
MATHAYUS: Stay behind me.

38:17.800 --> 38:19.300
LAYLA: As you wish.

38:19.900 --> 38:22.800
I've never heard those words
from your mouth before.

38:51.200 --> 38:53.300
You're not scared
are you?

38:53.500 --> 38:54.700

39:52.700 --> 39:55.400
That Akkadian
looked familiar to me.

39:56.300 --> 39:58.100
Who was his father?

40:00.100 --> 40:02.500
A famous mercenary
named Ashur.

40:06.600 --> 40:08.500
I was afraid of that.

40:13.300 --> 40:14.500
Men.

Illyrian honor calls.

40:28.800 --> 40:30.800
Yeah I was afraid of that.

41:18.900 --> 41:22.500
I feel like we're going in circles.
Weren't we just here?

the hell is this?

cinching her bust and pouting her lips.

Are you a man or a woman?

01:05:45.200 --> 01:05:49.200
I daresay you could not seduce a beggar

01:05:49.300 --> 01:05:52.800

between your thighs.

I have a thousand temples

This is personal.

01:22:27.600 --> 01:22:28.800
Where are you two going?

01:22:28.900 --> 01:22:32.600

01:22:36.100 --> 01:22:40.400

To keep them
from becoming unruly.

01:23:04.400 --> 01:23:08.200
King Sargon salutes you
citizens of Nippur.

01:23:08.800 --> 01:23:13.500

01:23:16.000 --> 01:23:17.000
Great gift?

01:23:17.100 --> 01:23:20.000
...and the blessing
of the goddess Astarte.

01:23:20.700 --> 01:23:22.700
I've got a bad
feeling about this.

01:23:22.800 --> 01:23:26.200

in your new spirit.

How can this be?

01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:35.700
What magic is this?

01:25:35.700 --> 01:25:39.000
No my son it is not
the magic that you think.

01:25:41.500 --> 01:25:45.300
It is the wondrous power
and the miracle of the sword

01:25:45.300 --> 01:25:48.500
that you hold that has
allowed us to meet again.

01:25:49.700 --> 01:25:51.300

I saw you in the Underworld.

when you were
a very young boy

01:26:07.800 --> 01:26:10.400
and sometimes
when you were frightened

01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:15.000
I would put my arms around you
and whisper something in your ear

01:26:15.500 --> 01:26:18.400

would ever know?

01:26:43.200 --> 01:26:45.000

trust a Greek eh?

Nothing personal Mathayus.

01:30:12.800 --> 01:30:15.700
But a fortune in jewels
and a good tale to tell...

01:30:15.700 --> 01:30:18.000
