[***]

00:35.369 --> 00:38.272
[***]

00:40.541 --> 00:42.643
Dino Dana!

01:31.392 --> 01:36.297
[***]

01:37.698 --> 01:40.801
Squawk.
Squawk. Squawk.

01:44.338 --> 01:46.540
Sara, look.

01:46.574 --> 01:48.142
Sara, Sara!

01:52.680 --> 01:55.283
Sara.

01:55.316 --> 01:59.820
[music on headphones]

01:59.853 --> 02:03.524
[***]

02:05.259 --> 02:06.627
[sighs]
Wow.

02:33.221 --> 02:34.455
Dana.

02:34.488 --> 02:36.657
What? You had
a booger in your nose?

02:36.690 --> 02:38.659
And hey, look.

02:38.692 --> 02:41.329
Cool book you should
want to look at.

02:41.362 --> 02:43.731
A dinosaur.
Wow.

02:43.764 --> 02:45.833
- And?
- It's green?

02:45.866 --> 02:47.368
And?

02:47.401 --> 02:48.669
And what?

02:48.702 --> 02:51.372
- And what's its name?
- Troodon.

02:51.405 --> 02:53.241
How did you know that?

02:53.274 --> 02:56.310
Because it's one of your top
105 favorite dinosaurs.

02:56.344 --> 02:58.446
Number 68.

02:58.479 --> 03:01.482
Wait, why is this
alligator

03:01.515 --> 03:02.516
eating its babies?

03:02.550 --> 03:04.218
It's not.

03:04.252 --> 03:05.786
That's how alligators
protect their babies.

03:05.819 --> 03:08.789
They put them in their mouth
and carry them to safety.

03:08.822 --> 03:10.724
Do you want to
pull the tab?

03:10.758 --> 03:12.260
Come on, "seester",
pull it.

03:12.293 --> 03:14.328
This one you can
push up and down.

03:16.964 --> 03:19.600
It's better if you
make a sound too.

03:19.633 --> 03:23.604
[sighs]
Roar... or...

03:23.637 --> 03:26.440
I don't think it sounded
like that at all.

03:26.474 --> 03:28.242
Really?

03:28.276 --> 03:29.810
No.
See those pictures?

03:29.843 --> 03:32.546
Dinosaurs were a lot
like birds and reptiles.

03:32.580 --> 03:34.382
They had feathers
like birds

03:34.415 --> 03:36.317
and scales like reptiles

03:36.350 --> 03:38.886
and had babies in eggs,
just like both of them.

03:38.919 --> 03:40.321
So?

03:40.354 --> 03:42.490
So, when was
the last time you heard

03:42.523 --> 03:44.258
a bird or an alligator roar?

03:44.292 --> 03:45.826
I think they whistled
like birds.

03:45.859 --> 03:47.528
Really big birds.

03:47.561 --> 03:50.298
Hmm, I never thought
of it like that, cool.

03:50.331 --> 03:52.400
Do you want to play
dinosaur with me?

03:52.433 --> 03:53.434
Not right now.

03:53.467 --> 03:54.802
Come on.

03:54.835 --> 03:57.905
We used to play dino
together all the time.

03:57.938 --> 03:59.440
Please?

03:59.473 --> 04:01.509
You can be whatever
dinosaur you want.

04:01.542 --> 04:03.677
Except the Troodon.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.546
I want that one.

04:05.579 --> 04:08.416
Maybe later.
Is this the book you want?

04:08.449 --> 04:10.250
Yep.

04:12.620 --> 04:14.322
I'll wait here.

04:18.659 --> 04:22.930
[pop music]

04:30.771 --> 04:33.341
- Excuse me.
- How can I help you?

04:33.374 --> 04:35.075
I'd like to borrow
this book, please.

04:35.108 --> 04:36.877
Oh, so you like dinosaurs.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.579
No.

04:38.612 --> 04:41.014
I love them.

04:41.048 --> 04:42.983
Especially
the Troodon.

04:43.016 --> 04:46.754
It looked like this
with long tail feathers

04:46.787 --> 04:48.656
and really sharp claws.

04:48.689 --> 04:49.857
Nice backpack.

04:49.890 --> 04:52.460
Uh...
Dana.

04:52.493 --> 04:54.428
Thanks.
My dad made it for me.

04:54.462 --> 04:56.997
- Want to see what it can do?
- Sure.

04:57.030 --> 04:58.932
You can use the zippers
and buttons

04:58.966 --> 05:01.068
so you can be whatever
dinosaur you want.

05:04.705 --> 05:06.807
Bet you don't know
what this one is.

05:06.840 --> 05:08.442
Hmm big frill.

05:08.476 --> 05:10.844
- Is it a...
- I'll give you a hint.

05:10.878 --> 05:12.713
These are horns.

05:12.746 --> 05:15.883
There should be three of them,
but I only have two hands.

05:15.916 --> 05:17.585
That's another hint.

05:17.618 --> 05:18.852
Triceratops?

05:18.886 --> 05:21.489
- Ding, ding, ding.
- I like dinosaurs too.

05:21.522 --> 05:23.857
Could you imagine meeting
a real-life dinosaur?

05:23.891 --> 05:26.026
That's my biggest
wish ever.

05:26.059 --> 05:27.795
Too bad they aren't
around anymore.

05:27.828 --> 05:30.798
Sometimes you just need to
know how to look for them.

05:32.800 --> 05:35.436
Whoa, you've taken out
like every single dinosaur book

05:35.469 --> 05:36.670
we have here.

05:36.704 --> 05:39.740
Yep.
That's the last new one.

05:41.975 --> 05:45.613
Tell you what.
Why don't you try this book?

05:45.646 --> 05:48.882
My brother and I call it
a dino field guide.

05:48.916 --> 05:51.419
A dino field guide?

05:51.452 --> 05:52.720
It's filled with
dinosaur experiments

05:52.753 --> 05:54.688
that need finishing.

05:56.490 --> 05:59.026
Ooh I bet you like this one,
dino experiment 501,

05:59.059 --> 06:00.661
how did the Troodon
protect its eggs?

06:00.694 --> 06:02.530
How did it do it?

06:02.563 --> 06:05.098
Well I don't know.
You'll have to figure it out.

06:05.132 --> 06:08.969
But the only way to solve it
would be to meet a real Troodon.

06:09.002 --> 06:12.473
- Wouldn't that be fun?
- Can I keep it until tomorrow?

06:12.506 --> 06:15.108
Tell you what, Dan-a.

06:15.142 --> 06:16.677
Dana.

06:16.710 --> 06:19.480
You can keep it for
as long as you want.

06:19.513 --> 06:21.014
Just promise to pass it off

06:21.048 --> 06:22.483
to another
paleontologist in training

06:22.516 --> 06:23.517
when you're done with it.

06:23.551 --> 06:25.052
I will.
Troodon promise.

06:25.085 --> 06:28.088
You just make a claw with
your hand, and then shake.

06:28.121 --> 06:30.891
- Thanks...
- Trek. My name's Trek.

06:30.924 --> 06:32.660
Thanks, Trek.

06:41.001 --> 06:42.936
Sar, guess what?

06:42.970 --> 06:46.607
I've got a dino experiment.
Do you want to do it with me?

06:49.176 --> 06:50.578
[odd screeching]

06:50.611 --> 06:52.045
What was that?

06:58.852 --> 07:00.488
Where's that
coming from?

07:00.521 --> 07:02.623
[odd screeching]

07:02.656 --> 07:04.525
Let me try whistling back.

07:04.558 --> 07:06.193
[whistles]

07:06.226 --> 07:08.796
I think someone
is playing a game with me.

07:08.829 --> 07:10.864
[whistles]

07:14.702 --> 07:16.069
[whistles]

07:20.173 --> 07:22.009

07:29.016 --> 07:30.918

[gasps]

07:36.924 --> 07:38.458

07:40.928 --> 07:44.532
I don't believe it.

07:44.565 --> 07:47.167

07:48.569 --> 07:49.903
[coos]

07:51.605 --> 07:54.041

07:54.074 --> 07:57.711
A real-life dinosaur?

07:57.745 --> 08:00.047
[loud chirps]

08:02.149 --> 08:04.251
Hello, Troodon.

08:09.189 --> 08:11.058
You like my backpack?

08:11.091 --> 08:13.727
[cooing]

08:13.761 --> 08:16.730
You want me
to follow you?

08:16.764 --> 08:18.632
[coos and squawks]

08:18.666 --> 08:21.201
Do you think I'm a Troodon
because of my backpack?

08:21.234 --> 08:23.103
[squawks]

08:23.136 --> 08:25.005
You think I'm a Troodon!

08:25.038 --> 08:27.307
[squawks]

08:27.340 --> 08:29.610
I'm coming!
I'm coming!

08:30.711 --> 08:35.549
[squawks]

08:38.118 --> 08:40.020
Is this your nest,
Troodon?

08:40.053 --> 08:42.022
[squawks]

08:42.055 --> 08:44.257
I've never seen
a dinosaur nest before.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.193
And look, you got an egg.

08:46.226 --> 08:49.196
Now I'll be able to see
how you protect your egg

08:49.229 --> 08:53.100
and solve dino
experiment 501.

08:53.133 --> 08:55.235
Troodon?

08:55.268 --> 08:57.571
Troodon?

08:57.605 --> 09:00.273
Troo-don?

09:00.307 --> 09:02.175
[growls]

09:02.209 --> 09:04.177
That doesn't sound
like a Troodon.

09:04.211 --> 09:07.547
[squawks]

09:10.150 --> 09:11.952
An Ozraptor.

09:11.985 --> 09:15.155
I can't believe
how amazing this is.

09:17.324 --> 09:19.760
Your name means
Australian thief.

09:19.793 --> 09:23.063
Thief.
Oh no.

09:23.096 --> 09:25.232
You're probably here to steal
the Troodon's egg.

09:25.265 --> 09:26.934
Think, Dana, think.

09:26.967 --> 09:30.037
If I were a Troodon,
how would I protect my egg?

09:30.070 --> 09:32.773
There's only one thing
that can save that egg.

09:32.806 --> 09:34.107
Research.

09:37.277 --> 09:41.248
[pop music]

09:41.281 --> 09:42.816
[Dana]
Squawk.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.854
Squawk! Squawk!

09:49.089 --> 09:51.324
Squawk! Squawk!

09:51.358 --> 09:53.694
[sighs]

09:55.295 --> 09:57.330
Squawk! Squawk!

09:57.364 --> 09:59.232
Squawk!
Squawk!

09:59.266 --> 10:01.334
Squawk! Squawk!

10:01.368 --> 10:03.671
Squawk!
Squawk!

10:03.704 --> 10:05.405
Squawk! Squawk!

10:05.438 --> 10:08.842
Squawk!
Squawk!

10:08.876 --> 10:11.344
Dana, what are you doing?

10:11.378 --> 10:14.147
Solving a dino experiment,
obviously.

10:14.181 --> 10:16.016
What are you
talking about?

10:16.049 --> 10:18.185
I remembered Troodons
were like birds,

10:18.218 --> 10:21.054
so I read how birds
protect their eggs.

10:21.088 --> 10:22.990
Some birds
protect their eggs

10:23.023 --> 10:24.925
by staying in
large groups

10:24.958 --> 10:26.827
like penguins

10:26.860 --> 10:28.228
and flamingos.

10:28.261 --> 10:29.963
Safety in numbers

10:29.997 --> 10:32.332
but because you didn't
want to play with me,

10:32.365 --> 10:34.434
I was all alone.

10:34.467 --> 10:37.805
So, I pretended
I was a peacock.

10:37.838 --> 10:39.807
They protect their babies
by showing off

10:39.840 --> 10:41.809
their bright feathers
to predators

10:41.842 --> 10:44.044
like this.

10:44.077 --> 10:45.946
- Squawk! Squawk!
- Dana, Dana.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.348
This is a library.
You need to be quiet.

10:48.381 --> 10:51.284
No, you need to help me
protect the Troodon's nest.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.253
Come and look at it.

10:53.286 --> 10:55.388
That Ozraptor might
come back soon.

10:55.422 --> 10:57.324
Dana, I'll play dinosaurs
with you later.

10:57.357 --> 10:59.760
You always say that
and we never do.

10:59.793 --> 11:01.895
Just like we never
make our dinosaur crafts

11:01.929 --> 11:03.764
together
anymore either.

11:03.797 --> 11:06.967
[sighs] Just... try to keep
it down a bit, okay?

11:07.000 --> 11:08.401
But Sara!

11:08.435 --> 11:10.103
Shh.

11:10.137 --> 11:11.805
Okay.

11:13.406 --> 11:15.208
Okay, seester?

11:15.242 --> 11:17.410
[whispers]
Whisper battle.

11:17.444 --> 11:19.112
- Seester.
- Seester.

11:19.146 --> 11:21.081
- Seester.
- Seester.

11:21.114 --> 11:23.817
[Sara] You win.
Just try to keep it down, Dana.

11:27.755 --> 11:29.322
Are you hatching,
baby Troodon?

11:29.356 --> 11:32.826
I can't believe I'm going
to see a real live baby dinosaur

11:32.860 --> 11:34.795
hatch from its egg.

11:34.828 --> 11:36.463
This is incredible.

11:38.198 --> 11:41.301
[loud roar]

11:46.073 --> 11:47.207
It's the...

11:47.240 --> 11:48.776
it's the...

11:48.809 --> 11:50.778
king of the dinosaurs!

11:50.811 --> 11:54.147
You sound hungry
for eggs, T-Rex.

11:54.181 --> 11:56.884
[sniffs]

11:56.917 --> 11:58.318
Think, Dana, think.

11:58.351 --> 12:01.354
If I were a Troodon,
how would I protect my egg

12:01.388 --> 12:03.323
from something
as big as T-Rex?

12:03.356 --> 12:05.192
[squawks]

12:05.225 --> 12:08.428
Of course, Dinosaurs are a lot
like birds and reptiles.

12:08.461 --> 12:11.298
Some reptiles put their babies
in their mouth to protect...

12:13.366 --> 12:15.135
I'll explain later.

12:15.168 --> 12:18.271
[squawks]

12:18.305 --> 12:20.974
[roars]

12:21.008 --> 12:25.412
* Cause love is like
floating on sunshine *

12:25.445 --> 12:28.448
* And dancing on rainbows.

12:28.481 --> 12:30.851
* And when
I'm with you *

12:30.884 --> 12:33.553
* I hope you're
feeling it too. *

12:33.586 --> 12:35.823
* Ooh.

12:35.856 --> 12:39.226
* Cause love is
like open sky *

12:39.259 --> 12:42.529
* with my head
in the clouds. *

12:42.562 --> 12:46.033
* I don't care
I don't care if I ever come- *

12:48.235 --> 12:52.806
* I don't care
I don't care if I ever come- *

[Troodon coos]

13:16.897 --> 13:19.232
[roars]

13:22.102 --> 13:25.038
Are you starting to hatch,
baby Troodon?

13:25.072 --> 13:27.107
I can see your claw.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.578
That's it.
You can do it.

13:41.989 --> 13:44.324
Aww.

13:44.357 --> 13:46.193
There's your
little snout, baby.

13:48.295 --> 13:49.930
One more big push.

13:52.232 --> 13:56.036
Hello, baby Troodon.
It's so cute!

13:56.069 --> 13:58.038
[coos]

13:58.071 --> 14:00.073
[whistles]

14:00.107 --> 14:01.942

14:01.975 --> 14:04.077
[coos]

14:04.111 --> 14:05.979
[chirps]

14:06.013 --> 14:07.580
Sh, baby.

14:07.614 --> 14:09.549
It's probably not
good to be whistling

14:09.582 --> 14:12.019
when there's a hungry
T-Rex around.

14:12.052 --> 14:13.653
Oh, come on.

14:13.686 --> 14:15.055
Please be quiet, baby.

14:15.088 --> 14:19.927
[chirping]

14:22.295 --> 14:24.131
[roars]

14:26.366 --> 14:27.968
Shh...

14:29.236 --> 14:32.973
[snorts]

14:33.006 --> 14:34.507
Hey, T-Rex.

14:34.541 --> 14:37.110
I'm sure that Ozraptor
would make a better snack

14:37.144 --> 14:39.312
than this little
baby Troodon.

14:40.948 --> 14:42.182
[snorts]

14:44.617 --> 14:46.453
You don't agree?

14:50.991 --> 14:52.259
Hang on, baby.

14:58.265 --> 15:00.300
[roars]

15:00.333 --> 15:02.169
[panting]

15:02.202 --> 15:07.074
[***]

15:09.642 --> 15:11.144
[roars]

15:11.178 --> 15:13.947
We got to get you away
from that hungry T-Rex,

15:13.981 --> 15:15.148
baby Troodon.

15:18.151 --> 15:19.519
This will slow her down.

15:22.089 --> 15:24.124
[roars]

15:24.157 --> 15:25.492
Hurry, baby.

15:30.397 --> 15:33.366
[roars]

15:40.007 --> 15:41.641
[chirps]

15:44.711 --> 15:46.413
[snarls]

15:46.446 --> 15:48.448
Sorry, T-Rex.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.383
Come on, baby.

15:50.417 --> 15:54.021
[***]

16:03.496 --> 16:05.232
[Sara]
Oh, Dana.

16:11.504 --> 16:14.374
[***]

16:14.407 --> 16:16.343
[chirping]

16:16.376 --> 16:17.710
Come on, baby.

16:17.744 --> 16:19.379
Come on!

16:19.412 --> 16:22.149
Oh, there you are.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.551
How else do you protect
your babies, mama Troodon?

16:24.584 --> 16:26.553
[coos]

16:26.586 --> 16:29.156
The T-Rex has the largest
nose of any dinosaur.

16:29.189 --> 16:31.691
I don't think it will
take her too long to...

16:31.724 --> 16:34.127
[roars]

16:36.063 --> 16:38.131
[roars]

16:39.532 --> 16:41.334
Find us.

16:42.735 --> 16:45.438
Dana...

16:45.472 --> 16:47.207
Dana?

16:47.240 --> 16:50.243
[squawks]

16:50.277 --> 16:52.179
What are you squawking at,
mama dino?

16:52.212 --> 16:54.081
[squawks]

16:56.849 --> 16:59.286
A whole herd
of dinosaurs?

16:59.319 --> 17:00.420
They're beautiful.

17:00.453 --> 17:02.155
[roars]

17:02.189 --> 17:04.691
Except for when they
want to eat a baby dinosaur

17:04.724 --> 17:07.060
you just watched hatch.

17:07.094 --> 17:09.396
[chirps]

17:09.429 --> 17:10.697
Think, Dana, think.

17:10.730 --> 17:12.399
Why would the mama Troodon

17:12.432 --> 17:15.335
want to get to a giant herd
of other dinosaurs?

17:19.506 --> 17:21.508
Safety in numbers.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.676
If you're not
as strong as a T-Rex,

17:23.710 --> 17:26.346
hide around other
dinosaurs that are.

17:26.379 --> 17:27.780
Smart thinking,
Mama Troodon.

17:27.814 --> 17:29.782
[coos]

17:29.816 --> 17:32.385
Dana.

17:32.419 --> 17:34.321
Where are you?

17:37.157 --> 17:38.691
[roars]

17:38.725 --> 17:41.461
How do we get past
the king of the dinosaurs?

17:41.494 --> 17:44.531
[chirps]

17:44.564 --> 17:46.866
We can't get past
the T-Rex.

17:46.899 --> 17:49.636
[chirps]

17:49.669 --> 17:51.604
But we can go through it.

17:51.638 --> 17:52.805
[squawks]

17:52.839 --> 17:56.343
T-Rex's are big but slow.

17:56.376 --> 17:58.878
Troodons are small and fast.

17:58.911 --> 18:01.181
Ready to run,
baby dino?

18:01.214 --> 18:04.617
[chirps]

18:04.651 --> 18:06.353
Then let's go.

18:08.188 --> 18:09.656
We're coming, T-Rex.

18:09.689 --> 18:11.558
[***]

18:11.591 --> 18:13.526
Watch out!

18:14.661 --> 18:16.463
Go around, baby.

18:16.496 --> 18:21.434
[***]

18:21.468 --> 18:23.436
[growls]

18:23.470 --> 18:25.872
[roars]

18:29.576 --> 18:31.411
Hey, T-Rex.

18:31.444 --> 18:33.380
Want a Troodon?

18:33.413 --> 18:35.782
Then eat this one!

18:35.815 --> 18:38.351
[roars]

18:38.385 --> 18:40.220
Run, baby!

18:42.722 --> 18:44.657
Sorry, T-Rex,
that's just a back pack

18:44.691 --> 18:46.459
that looks like a Troodon.

18:46.493 --> 18:48.661
Better luck on
your next hunt.

18:48.695 --> 18:50.230
Come on.

18:50.263 --> 18:52.232
Your name means
king of the dinosaurs,

18:52.265 --> 18:53.700
I'm sure you'll catch
something soon.

18:53.733 --> 18:55.735
[growls]

18:55.768 --> 18:57.837
[squawks]

18:59.939 --> 19:02.575
Bye, T-Rex.
Happy hunting.

19:03.910 --> 19:08.415
[chirping]

19:08.448 --> 19:09.549
Bye baby!

19:09.582 --> 19:11.318
[squawks]

19:11.351 --> 19:12.852
[Sara]
Dana!

19:12.885 --> 19:15.388
Dana!

19:20.527 --> 19:23.696
Dana! Dana!

19:23.730 --> 19:25.498
Sara!

19:25.532 --> 19:26.933
Where did you go?

19:26.966 --> 19:28.868
I've been looking
all over for you.

19:28.901 --> 19:30.837
Where's your shoe

19:30.870 --> 19:33.406
and what happened
to your backpack?

19:33.440 --> 19:35.908
Dad's going to be upset.

19:35.942 --> 19:38.411
Sar, you won't believe it.

19:38.445 --> 19:40.947
I just got chased
by a T-Rex.

19:40.980 --> 19:44.384
Well, it wasn't chasing me
as much as this baby Troodon

19:44.417 --> 19:45.518
that I was protecting.

19:45.552 --> 19:47.220
I'm just glad you're safe.

19:47.254 --> 19:49.322
Don't run off without
telling me next time.

19:52.292 --> 19:53.526
Dino promise?

19:54.894 --> 19:56.429
Dino promise.

19:56.463 --> 19:58.698
Hey, since you already
have a dino claw,

19:58.731 --> 20:00.633
do you want to play
dinosaurs now?

20:00.667 --> 20:04.003
Okay, but I get
to be the T-Rex.

20:04.036 --> 20:05.538
Roar!

20:05.572 --> 20:06.906
Or...

20:06.939 --> 20:09.909
- Did you drop this?
- Yes, and guess what?

20:09.942 --> 20:11.644
I solved dino
experiment 501,

20:11.678 --> 20:13.380
how the Troodon
protects its eggs.

20:13.413 --> 20:14.681
Good job.
How did they?

20:14.714 --> 20:16.849
They did it like birds,
and reptiles.

20:16.883 --> 20:20.520
Troodons made loud noises
to scare off smaller dinosaurs

20:20.553 --> 20:23.556
and move their eggs to keep
them safe from larger ones.

20:23.590 --> 20:25.858
Look what the T-Rex
did to my backpack.

20:25.892 --> 20:28.795
She's got a pretty
powerful imagination.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.530
The coolest kids do.

20:30.563 --> 20:33.400
Yeah, I used to have
an imaginary friend unicorn.

20:33.433 --> 20:35.868
You still talk to
Princess Rainbow Moon Ray.

20:35.902 --> 20:37.804
No, I don't.

20:37.837 --> 20:39.906
Neigh.

20:39.939 --> 20:42.309
Trek, are you almost
ready to head home?

20:42.342 --> 20:45.945
- Oh, Dan, I want you to meet-
- Sara. She's my big sister.

20:45.978 --> 20:48.781
And this is her
little sister, Dana.

20:48.815 --> 20:50.517
Dana's going to be
looking after

20:50.550 --> 20:52.552
our dino field guide
for a while.

20:55.855 --> 20:59.526
Dino Dana.
I like the sound of that.

21:01.894 --> 21:04.631
Maybe I'll see you both
around the library sometime.

21:04.664 --> 21:06.599
Absolutely.

21:06.633 --> 21:09.636
If you're lucky.

21:09.669 --> 21:12.004
What?

21:12.038 --> 21:14.641
Good luck catching me,
sister T-Rex.

21:14.674 --> 21:16.042
