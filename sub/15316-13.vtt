WEBVTT

00:06.705 --> 00:08.401
Previously on "Sanctuary"...

00:08.508 --> 00:09.805
The war has begun.

00:09.909 --> 00:11.433
Abnormals
in the path of the agent

00:11.611 --> 00:15.445
are showing rapid onset of clinical
paranoia and extreme aggression.

00:15.949 --> 00:17.917
Pitting humans
against abnormals,

00:18.084 --> 00:19.915
deciding who lives and who dies...

00:20.086 --> 00:21.553
The cabal has to be stopped.

00:21.721 --> 00:23.882
It's why I started this mission
more than a century ago.

00:24.324 --> 00:25.018
Dr. Watson?

00:25.191 --> 00:27.989
Not as in James Watson
who's a member of the Five?

00:28.161 --> 00:29.287
Why are you here, Druitt?

00:29.462 --> 00:31.953
Well, to save the world
as we know it, and, time allowing,

00:32.064 --> 00:35.034
reassert my superiority
in our battle of wits.

00:35.902 --> 00:37.062
Nigel Griffin is dead,

00:37.170 --> 00:39.638
but his powers were passed on
to his granddaughter, Clara.

00:42.475 --> 00:43.567
I just know
that we only have days

00:43.676 --> 00:46.236
to stop the destruction
of every abnormal on earth.

00:46.646 --> 00:49.012
It may well be that the source blood
could stop the disease

00:49.115 --> 00:51.583
in the form
of a synthesized antitoxin.

00:51.751 --> 00:52.775
Where did Gregory hide the vial?

00:52.952 --> 00:55.750
The lost city of Bhalasaam
in the Indian Himalayas.

00:55.922 --> 00:57.583
And he made sure
that only the five of us

00:57.757 --> 00:59.748
acting in concert could retrieve it.

01:00.226 --> 01:02.922
Which is a bit of a problem
if, in fact, I have killed Tesla.

01:03.029 --> 01:04.997
Hello, Nicola.

01:06.132 --> 01:07.030
It's all been destroyed.

01:07.133 --> 01:08.191
It's over.

01:08.368 --> 01:10.097
There has to be a way
into the labyrinth.

01:10.737 --> 01:13.934
Your mother and her colleagues
will no doubt try to stop us.

01:14.107 --> 01:16.007
I promise you they'll fail.

01:16.109 --> 01:20.546
They'll fail because you're going
to help us complete our plan.

01:25.585 --> 01:27.177
Where's Henry?

01:28.154 --> 01:29.985
Not far.

01:30.690 --> 01:34.091
- If you hurt him, I swear I will-
- Oh, we will hurt him.

01:34.260 --> 01:35.989
In fact, the quality and quantity

01:36.162 --> 01:38.687
of what remains of his life
very much depends on you.

01:40.166 --> 01:42.066
I'll tell you whatever you want.
Just let Henry live.

01:42.235 --> 01:45.363
Is that what you think we are?
Killers, murderers?

01:45.538 --> 01:48.996
That bioweapon you set off?
Not exactly charity work.

01:49.109 --> 01:51.839
In fact, that's exactly what it is.

01:52.011 --> 01:55.242
A helping hand to the humans so
that they can clearly see the threat

01:55.348 --> 01:57.646
to the very survival
of our species.

01:57.817 --> 01:59.512
You're starting a war.

01:59.619 --> 02:00.643
We're controlling our destiny.

02:00.753 --> 02:03.449
Most of the abnormals out there
are peaceful. They aren't a threat.

02:03.556 --> 02:06.491
Every abnormal we don't control
is a threat, Ashley.

02:06.659 --> 02:09.321
Despite your mother's
propaganda.

02:09.596 --> 02:12.656
How many so-called peaceful
abnormals have you destroyed?

02:15.735 --> 02:17.293
You know...

02:18.571 --> 02:19.868
I like your mother.

02:20.640 --> 02:22.665
There was a time
I even admired her,

02:22.842 --> 02:24.867
but we are fighting
for humanity's survival,

02:24.978 --> 02:27.378
and she's chosen the wrong side.

02:28.047 --> 02:31.210
Are you ready to choose yours?

02:33.000 --> 02:39.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:04.150 --> 03:06.618
Where's the amazing lost city?

03:06.719 --> 03:11.452
The temples, the archives...
A decent restroom?

03:11.624 --> 03:14.718
It's gone.
Destroyed long ago.

03:15.128 --> 03:19.258
By the age of this vegetation,
I'd say, I don't know, 50, 60 years?

03:19.365 --> 03:20.423
100 years,

03:20.533 --> 03:22.728
if the growth pattern of this hedera
is any indication.

03:22.835 --> 03:24.097
Destroyed how?

03:24.637 --> 03:27.265
Looks like some sort
of massive bombing.

03:27.407 --> 03:29.375
It couldn't have been
from the air, though.

03:29.475 --> 03:30.965
There were no planes
that could carry

03:31.144 --> 03:32.975
that kind of ordnance
a hundred years ago.

03:33.079 --> 03:35.479
Four days
of constant bombardment.

03:36.149 --> 03:38.583
Hundreds of men,
their heaviest weaponry.

03:38.751 --> 03:42.949
Cannon placements there and there.
Long and short-range.

03:43.056 --> 03:47.288
Likely a combined effort between
Russian, French and Spanish forces.

03:47.460 --> 03:50.122
I thought by that point in history,
all the vampires were wiped out.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.492
They were.

03:51.664 --> 03:54.292
They retreated here to preserve
what was left of their culture.

03:54.567 --> 03:57.400
They'd been culled to
within a hair's breadth of extinction.

03:57.570 --> 04:00.505
They weren't a threat to anyone.
This was a slaughter.

04:00.707 --> 04:02.800
Gregory's instructions mentioned

04:02.909 --> 04:04.706
a hall of records as a starting point.

04:04.811 --> 04:09.077
They also mentioned a city,
fully intact.

04:09.182 --> 04:10.444
For all we know, the caverns below

04:10.550 --> 04:11.710
have been destroyed as well.

04:11.818 --> 04:14.252
Sorry, John, are you suggesting
that we just give up?

04:14.420 --> 04:16.684
Oh, don't bait me.
I'm not in the mood.

04:16.856 --> 04:20.952
Perhaps if we were looking
for some nubile lady of the night

04:21.060 --> 04:24.257
for you to slaughter,
then you'd suddenly perk up

04:24.364 --> 04:25.956
and become incredibly helpful!

04:26.065 --> 04:28.590
Gentlemen, enough!

04:29.902 --> 04:31.995
Good work, old boy.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.938
Another test of my loyalty.

04:35.041 --> 04:36.975
Just checking.

04:50.390 --> 04:52.187
What do you want from me?

04:53.960 --> 04:55.928
Talk to me!

04:56.095 --> 04:58.859
How long have you known
of your condition?

04:59.098 --> 05:00.656
It's not a condition.

05:00.833 --> 05:03.893
Do you know the exact geographical
region where you were found?

05:04.070 --> 05:07.733
What kind of treatments has
Dr. Magnus prescribed for you?

05:07.840 --> 05:09.467
Can you elaborate
on their effectiveness?

05:09.809 --> 05:12.039
Length of transformative episodes?

05:13.179 --> 05:15.613
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

05:15.715 --> 05:17.649
What are you doing?
Don't! Don't!

05:19.152 --> 05:22.212
Shh, shh, shh... We simply want
to help you get better.

05:22.388 --> 05:25.585
I'm not sick.
This is not a condition!

05:25.692 --> 05:29.389
You are a class nine
hyper-accelerated protean life-form.

05:29.562 --> 05:33.123
Fairly rare, as is the control
you seem to possess

05:33.232 --> 05:35.427
over mutative stress triggers.

05:35.535 --> 05:37.127
No, please.

05:37.236 --> 05:38.760
You do not
want to make that happen.

05:39.872 --> 05:42.238
On the contrary,
we very much do,

05:42.408 --> 05:44.467
although I can understand
why you would resist.

05:46.713 --> 05:49.045
I am not ashamed of who I am.

05:49.215 --> 05:50.307
I certainly hope not,

05:50.416 --> 05:54.011
because we intend to bring out
your alter ego permanently.

05:54.120 --> 05:56.884
The knowledge we gain from you
will be invaluable.

05:57.056 --> 05:58.751
Your kind have been hiding
in the shadows

05:58.858 --> 06:00.587
for far too long, Mr. Foss.

06:01.794 --> 06:05.787
We're going to...
bring you out into the light.

06:13.339 --> 06:14.499
Anything?

06:14.607 --> 06:16.040
Nothing for miles.

06:16.142 --> 06:18.372
No other entrances
to the mountain.

06:18.478 --> 06:19.911
It'll be dark soon.

06:20.079 --> 06:22.070
We should head back
and start fresh tomorrow.

06:22.248 --> 06:23.545
No, no, no, you go.

06:23.816 --> 06:25.283
Yeah, I'm staying, too.

06:25.451 --> 06:27.817
There has to be something,
a sense of...

06:27.987 --> 06:30.080
Scale. Yeah, exactly.

06:32.925 --> 06:35.120
- There.
- What?

06:35.828 --> 06:38.160
Well, I know it's from a distance,

06:38.264 --> 06:41.631
but the location
of this central ziggurat here

06:41.801 --> 06:43.393
should be that area
right there.

06:44.303 --> 06:46.931
Assuming the city
was built around it, absolutely.

06:54.280 --> 06:56.305
Which would mean that
the hall of records is located-

06:56.482 --> 07:00.145
27 meters southeast
of our current position.

07:09.128 --> 07:12.791
This is the main thoroughfare,
the central meeting hall.

07:12.965 --> 07:16.958
It's the wall defenses,
and the hall of records. Ah...

07:17.069 --> 07:19.867
It took me a while
to locate the right markers.

07:20.640 --> 07:23.302
Wow, you... You totally got that.
You saw everything.

07:23.476 --> 07:25.876
Oh, very clearly, Will, very clearly.

07:26.045 --> 07:27.569
Well, then, let's have at it.

07:31.417 --> 07:32.611
Time.

07:32.718 --> 07:33.946
You factored in time.

07:34.053 --> 07:36.681
The shifting architectural patterns
as the city grew.

07:36.789 --> 07:38.950
Time is a constant, Will.

07:39.592 --> 07:41.617
No, all visual clues
have to be measured

07:41.727 --> 07:46.130
against multiple parameters,
time often being the most telling.

07:46.232 --> 07:47.927
Like another dimension.

07:48.034 --> 07:49.331
Yeah, it's just one of many,

07:49.435 --> 07:51.767
and once you understand
the way they interact,

07:51.871 --> 07:55.329
you'll find that very few mysteries
will confound you.

07:55.975 --> 07:57.670
Man, that is killer stuff.

07:57.777 --> 07:59.938
Yes, I've always thought so.

08:00.847 --> 08:02.314
Are you certain?

08:02.415 --> 08:06.715
Yeah, this should be the main foyer
for the Bhalasaam Hall of Records.

08:06.819 --> 08:09.788
My father's instructions mentioned
a passageway or corridor

08:09.889 --> 08:11.914
leading to subterranean caverns
below.

08:12.091 --> 08:13.388
We have no idea

08:13.493 --> 08:16.929
what the original interior
of this building looked like.

08:17.230 --> 08:19.721
Let alone where an access point
may be.

08:36.414 --> 08:37.677
Well done.

08:39.519 --> 08:42.181
I am seriously
geeking out right now.

08:42.288 --> 08:44.347
As am I.

09:04.310 --> 09:09.077
Why would the vampires build
a cavern beneath a hidden city?

09:09.181 --> 09:12.412
It seems kind of redundant,
don't you think?

09:12.518 --> 09:14.543
Well, even though they were
the conquerors, the rulers,

09:14.654 --> 09:19.091
the overlords, they advanced
civilization by centuries.

09:19.191 --> 09:22.490
Their knowledge, their technology,
was far more advanced

09:22.595 --> 09:24.688
than anyone could have
imagined back then.

09:24.797 --> 09:28.289
So they kept their secrets
well hidden.

09:28.401 --> 09:31.700
Well, they knew the world
had turned against them, John.

09:33.272 --> 09:35.035
They would have calculated
for the possibility

09:35.141 --> 09:42.104
that Bhalasaam might one day
be found and pillaged.

09:42.214 --> 09:46.878
Lest their wealth of knowledge
fall into the wrong hands.

09:48.354 --> 09:49.719
Miss me?

09:50.389 --> 09:51.686
John.

09:51.791 --> 09:55.727
Oh, I know he's difficult to kill,
but I'm sure there are ways.

09:55.895 --> 09:58.830
Is that before or after
you retrieve the blood?

09:58.998 --> 10:01.865
Because, frankly,
good luck with that if I'm dead.

10:02.034 --> 10:04.832
You know, you can't do it
without me.

10:05.271 --> 10:09.207
Nice move last time we met, Johnny.

10:09.375 --> 10:12.276
Mmm... It took me a while
to get over it.

10:12.445 --> 10:15.642
Not long enough, old boy.
Care for another helping?

10:15.748 --> 10:17.215
What are you doing here,
Nicola?

10:23.789 --> 10:24.983
Isn't it obvious?

10:25.191 --> 10:27.250
The Cabal want to turn the world
into a war zone.

10:27.360 --> 10:29.225
Only the ancient blood
can stop it.

10:29.395 --> 10:32.592
Yes, I do keep abreast
of current events, thank you.

10:32.765 --> 10:34.665
Yet you refused to answer
any of our communiqués.

10:34.934 --> 10:37.869
My dear James.
You're looking... Older.

10:38.270 --> 10:41.262
- Feeling your age?
- Ever the gentleman, I see.

10:41.374 --> 10:42.864
And what have we here?

10:43.409 --> 10:47.539
I'm guessing that one of you must be
a blood relative of Nigel Griffin,

10:47.713 --> 10:49.010
otherwise why would you
have been brought along?

10:49.115 --> 10:50.514
I hope you're up to the task.

10:50.683 --> 10:52.651
- Damn straight I am, skinny.
- You, I like.

10:52.752 --> 10:55.846
- You, I don't know.
- I'm Dr. Zimmerman.

10:55.955 --> 10:57.320
I work with Dr. Magnus.

10:57.490 --> 10:58.752
A protégé.

10:59.792 --> 11:02.260
Well, the mission's necessary
disposable item-

11:02.428 --> 11:04.259
Stop this, Nicola.

11:04.363 --> 11:06.422
You know what we're facing.
Why not make contact?

11:06.532 --> 11:08.727
Firstly, I prefer to work alone.

11:08.901 --> 11:12.803
Secondly, I don't trust any of you
any more than you trust me.

11:12.972 --> 11:15.566
That's why I skipped the orientation
part of the tour.

11:15.675 --> 11:16.733
How did you get down here?

11:16.909 --> 11:18.501
There's another entrance,
far side of the mountain,

11:18.611 --> 11:21.671
just have to know
where to look for it, which I do.

11:21.814 --> 11:23.839
Now, follow me.

11:25.718 --> 11:27.583
Magnificent, isn't it?

11:27.687 --> 11:30.383
All that remains of my ancestors.

11:30.489 --> 11:31.956
Their work.

11:32.058 --> 11:38.088
10,000 years of knowledge
and power, hidden from the world.

11:38.197 --> 11:40.893
You've been coming
here for decades, haven't you?

11:41.000 --> 11:43.833
This is where you got the idea
to revive vampires as a race.

11:43.936 --> 11:47.565
Your father, he did his job well.

11:47.907 --> 11:52.401
Despite my best efforts, we can
only retrieve the blood as one.

11:52.511 --> 11:53.842
None of us can do it alone.

11:54.013 --> 11:55.640
Tell me, Nicola, if we do succeed,

11:55.748 --> 11:57.807
will you actually allow us
to take it away?

11:57.917 --> 12:00.852
We all know you have
such wonderful designs for it,

12:00.953 --> 12:03.786
an army of newborn vampires
being just the start.

12:03.889 --> 12:07.791
I may want to see my ancestors
reborn, but that can't happen

12:07.893 --> 12:10.225
if the abnormals become
a global threat to humans.

12:10.429 --> 12:14.263
None of us could withstand
the chaos that that would bring.

12:14.433 --> 12:15.957
Okay?

12:16.569 --> 12:17.763
But tell me, John,

12:17.937 --> 12:21.065
are the rest of us to trust you
once all is said and done?

12:21.974 --> 12:24.670
You, who once put
your own daughter in harm's way

12:24.844 --> 12:26.937
for just a drop of Helen's blood?

12:27.847 --> 12:29.007
Oh, yes.

12:29.115 --> 12:31.675
Having that vial all to yourself
would certainly solve

12:31.784 --> 12:35.811
your health problems
for a long time, wouldn't it?

12:36.555 --> 12:40.150
Gentlemen.
We are here for a reason.

12:40.626 --> 12:43.094
Nicola. Lives are at stake.

12:43.195 --> 12:45.163
This way.

12:47.566 --> 12:49.056
John...

12:49.335 --> 12:51.030
Thank you.

12:53.439 --> 12:55.407
What the hell
was all that about?

12:55.508 --> 13:00.707
Well, the guy who invented radio
just dissed Jack the Ripper.

13:02.915 --> 13:04.576
What are you doing, Dana?

13:04.683 --> 13:08.175
You haven't asked me
one real question yet.

13:11.123 --> 13:13.648
We have a lot more to discuss,
so please...

13:17.062 --> 13:18.324
Ashley, if I wanted you dead,

13:18.430 --> 13:20.660
there are more effective ways
than a poisoned drink.

13:26.739 --> 13:27.797
I want to see Henry.

13:29.008 --> 13:30.168
Now.

13:32.845 --> 13:35.507
I assure you, he's fine.

13:39.251 --> 13:40.377
Satisfied?

13:54.867 --> 13:56.232
Thank you.

13:56.402 --> 13:57.835
I'd like to keep you
alert and cooperative.

13:58.003 --> 13:59.766
Well, one out of two ain't bad.

14:00.272 --> 14:02.240
If you put a truth serum in this,
trust me,

14:02.408 --> 14:06.344
I will do a tap routine on this floor
rather than tell you anything.

14:07.947 --> 14:10.415
To tell you the truth,
I'm a terrible poker player.

14:10.516 --> 14:11.744
I never bluff.

14:11.917 --> 14:15.353
As for what we want,
information's not the only thing,

14:16.155 --> 14:19.249
not when you have
so much more to offer us.

14:45.317 --> 14:46.545
It won't work.

14:47.620 --> 14:50.418
You've been off your medication
for almost a day.

14:50.589 --> 14:52.386
The safeguards
have left your system.

14:52.491 --> 14:55.824
The pain you feel will end when
you stop resisting the change

14:55.928 --> 14:57.122
to your natural state.

14:57.229 --> 14:59.288
No, if I change, you'll kill me.

14:59.398 --> 15:03.391
True, but we'll have learned
so much in the process.

15:03.502 --> 15:04.662
Henry...

15:04.770 --> 15:07.466
This will be a noble end for you.

15:07.573 --> 15:10.337
Think of it as an organ donation
after your death.

15:10.910 --> 15:15.574
What we learn from your alter-ego
may eventually save lives.

15:16.048 --> 15:19.575
- Another 10 cc's.
- No! No, don't...

15:19.885 --> 15:21.648
No!

15:24.757 --> 15:26.850
This place goes on forever.

15:27.293 --> 15:31.662
It's a labyrinth. It's designed
to keep valuable secrets

15:31.764 --> 15:33.595
from those
who would steal them.

15:33.699 --> 15:36.600
- Was that aimed at me?
- Yes.

15:55.988 --> 15:58.422
Some sort of a numeric code.

15:58.791 --> 16:04.923
My mother's birthday.
My father's favorite password.

16:15.174 --> 16:17.404
- It's his handwriting.
- Latin?

16:17.576 --> 16:18.508
His favorite language.

16:18.610 --> 16:21.704
It's a caveat,
addressed to all five of us.

16:21.814 --> 16:24.908
It's a warning that the blood should
only be sought by all of us,

16:25.017 --> 16:25.915
or not at all.

16:26.018 --> 16:27.883
And only for the most
altruistic reasons.

16:28.053 --> 16:31.022
Well, saving civilization from global
chaos and war seems worthy,

16:31.190 --> 16:32.748
but he's your father.

16:32.858 --> 16:34.086
It's a map of the labyrinth.

16:34.893 --> 16:36.918
Look, there's five notations here.

16:37.029 --> 16:40.897
Yes, five tests. Each has one
of our names beside it.

16:41.066 --> 16:42.465
What kind of tests?

16:42.568 --> 16:44.866
Designed specifically
for each of our gifts.

16:44.970 --> 16:46.995
Impenetrable to anyone else.

16:47.673 --> 16:50.233
My father knew that in order
to prevent any one of us

16:50.342 --> 16:53.072
from trying to access the blood alone,
he had to use the technology

16:53.178 --> 16:55.772
the vampires left behind
to safeguard their secrets.

16:55.881 --> 16:57.678
And even you couldn't
find a way around it.

16:57.850 --> 16:58.942
I know. Nervous yet?

16:59.118 --> 17:00.745
And at the end
of each test there's a key.

17:00.853 --> 17:04.253
- Once we have the five keys...
- We can access the vial.

17:04.589 --> 17:06.114
My father loved
the metaphor of keys.

17:06.224 --> 17:08.250
He saw them as symbols
for the unlocking of secrets.

17:08.426 --> 17:12.261
So we can assume that none of
these tasks will be simple and easy?

17:12.431 --> 17:13.954
Knowing my father, absolutely.

17:14.066 --> 17:15.795
- May I?
- Oh, yes.

17:18.936 --> 17:23.101
Will, take Clara to Griffin's test.
That's here.

17:23.442 --> 17:26.605
Watson, yours and John's markers
are close together down there.

17:26.712 --> 17:29.374
Work as a team. We'll all meet
back here with our keys.

17:29.548 --> 17:31.209
That leaves you and Nicola.

17:31.316 --> 17:32.908
Your tests are marked
for the same area.

17:33.018 --> 17:36.010
I guess your father liked us best
as a couple.

17:37.856 --> 17:39.289
Helen, if you can wait
till I come back-

17:39.391 --> 17:41.916
- I'll be fine.
- Such chivalry.

17:42.995 --> 17:48.365
If any harm comes to her,
accidental or otherwise-

17:48.467 --> 17:50.833
I have no reason
to do her any harm, but you...

17:50.936 --> 17:53.131
I'm finding more reasons
by the minute.

17:53.305 --> 17:56.274
Honestly...
I am surrounded by adolescents.

18:03.449 --> 18:04.916
Let's go.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.995
Seems we go down this way.

18:35.447 --> 18:37.677
This room was marked "Griffin. "

18:43.889 --> 18:46.483
Doesn't seem so bad.

18:54.933 --> 18:57.993
Okay, this is bad.

19:05.410 --> 19:08.902
I believe this is our stop.

19:11.049 --> 19:16.316
Two Latin inscriptions
almost identical in meaning.

19:17.456 --> 19:20.914
- Almost?
- "Truth lies".

19:21.293 --> 19:22.817
"Lies truth".

19:22.995 --> 19:26.863
A slightly different
turn of phrase.

19:27.032 --> 19:30.490
Both doors
apparently with no means

19:30.602 --> 19:34.333
of opening them, and yet,
behind each of these doors...

19:34.439 --> 19:39.035
- ... lies our keys, logically.
- Logically.

19:39.478 --> 19:42.777
Both our names
were set for these doors,

19:42.881 --> 19:45.577
which implies that Gregory
intended for us to work together.

19:45.851 --> 19:49.287
So we cannot retrieve
one without the other, hmm?

19:49.454 --> 19:50.887
Hmm...

19:50.989 --> 19:52.786
Putting the analytical genius

19:52.891 --> 19:56.088
and the cold-blooded killer
in the same place.

19:56.862 --> 19:59.922
There must be a reason
beyond cruel irony.

20:00.032 --> 20:04.196
When he designed this, he knew us
as friends, James, not as enemies.

20:04.303 --> 20:07.761
- It was before I-
- Yes, yes.

20:10.943 --> 20:14.777
Doors that won't open,
yet their shape...

20:15.047 --> 20:19.313
They suggest something exists
beyond, a chamber, perhaps.

20:19.651 --> 20:25.521
Which I alone could access,
but which door do we believe, hmm?

20:25.791 --> 20:26.883
Perhaps both?

20:27.359 --> 20:28.223
Neither?

20:29.895 --> 20:32.329
I don't know, but I am convinced
of one thing-

20:32.497 --> 20:36.627
If we choose wrongly, and you
teleport behind the wrong door,

20:37.569 --> 20:40.629
I'm sure you will find...
solid rock.

20:42.708 --> 20:44.141
Well, then.

20:44.743 --> 20:47.075
We'd best choose carefully...

20:47.546 --> 20:50.344
...old friend.

21:00.359 --> 21:01.519
This is insane.

21:01.693 --> 21:03.092
No, no, it makes sense.

21:03.195 --> 21:05.925
Whenever light reflects off anything
visible, we lose ground.

21:06.098 --> 21:08.430
- Yeah, literally.
- Okay, okay.

21:08.533 --> 21:10.865
So all you have to do is make it
from here to there

21:10.969 --> 21:13.062
without casting a shadow,
and we'll get the key.

21:13.171 --> 21:14.866
You can do this.

21:17.809 --> 21:19.572
No, I can't.

21:19.678 --> 21:22.374
Clara, this is just adrenaline
triggering anxiety in your brain.

21:22.481 --> 21:24.039
You got to take the focus
off yourself,

21:24.149 --> 21:26.140
forget about everything else
except for the goal.

21:26.318 --> 21:27.717
Yeah? How?

21:28.020 --> 21:30.284
Well, how did you focus
when you used to steal?

21:30.555 --> 21:33.524
I'd, uh... I'd picture
the store clerk naked.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.458
- It helped me not feel so...
- Vulnerable, perfect.

21:36.561 --> 21:39.394
Okay, so just picture me naked.

21:44.369 --> 21:45.336
It's not working.

21:45.437 --> 21:46.961
Clara, you've done this
a thousand times.

21:47.239 --> 21:49.503
We're in a labyrinth, Will,
in the Himalayas.

21:49.608 --> 21:51.701
- I am going to die here-
- Okay, hey, hey, hey.

21:51.810 --> 21:53.505
Look at me, look at me.

21:53.879 --> 21:55.574
What can I do to help?

21:58.450 --> 22:00.008
Well, if I have to do it,
so should you.

22:03.855 --> 22:06.824
What?
Well, people can see me.

22:06.925 --> 22:11.259
You can see me. That's not fair.
I mean, that... I shouldn't have to...

22:18.370 --> 22:19.735
Okay, fine.

22:23.075 --> 22:25.043
This is ridiculous.

22:32.551 --> 22:33.950
Satisfied?

22:34.820 --> 22:36.219
Clara?

22:37.122 --> 22:39.249
Don't drop my clothes.

22:41.760 --> 22:42.852
Sorry.

22:47.099 --> 22:49.829
Ah, your test.

22:49.935 --> 22:50.924
Yeah.

22:51.036 --> 22:53.402
You said you tried to steal
the blood once before.

22:53.505 --> 22:54.938
That means you've already
done the test.

22:55.040 --> 22:56.735
No, I tried to steal it.

22:56.908 --> 22:59.468
I never succeeded
in actually getting the key.

23:02.981 --> 23:03.913
You're afraid.

23:04.783 --> 23:07.980
Your father managed
to rig this tunnel here

23:08.086 --> 23:10.884
with a massive
geomagnetic current.

23:11.056 --> 23:12.956
Voltage derived directly
from the earth.

23:13.058 --> 23:15.322
Do you have any idea
how much electricity that is?

23:16.027 --> 23:17.551
He knew you were hard to kill.

23:18.330 --> 23:20.230
Well, this just might do it.

24:03.909 --> 24:05.604
Awesome.

24:50.489 --> 24:52.719
Your father
really didn't like me, did he?

24:52.891 --> 24:54.358
You're an acquired taste.

24:54.526 --> 24:55.754
Uh-huh.

25:02.767 --> 25:07.795
The seventh girl you murdered,
April 1888,

25:07.906 --> 25:10.602
they found her body
under a bridge near Wapping.

25:10.709 --> 25:12.609
Why move her from Whitechapel?

25:13.812 --> 25:15.746
It's tormented me.

25:16.114 --> 25:20.710
Why taint your calling card?
Why change the rules?

25:21.753 --> 25:23.186
I remember...

25:23.522 --> 25:27.356
I asked your opinion at the time
over Brandies at the reform club,

25:27.459 --> 25:33.989
and you said, "Perhaps the old boy
is losing his taste for the sport. "

25:35.567 --> 25:36.727
Were you?

25:38.870 --> 25:45.901
My actions were not of my own,
but thrust upon me...

25:47.078 --> 25:48.978
...by an irresistible force.

25:52.951 --> 25:56.785
Oh, it must've been
quite the blow to your ego

25:56.888 --> 25:58.378
when you finally learned the truth.

25:58.557 --> 26:03.517
It was not just that I failed to see
the clues laid out before me.

26:04.496 --> 26:06.760
It was that it was you, John.

26:07.832 --> 26:10.198
For God's sake!

26:10.869 --> 26:13.394
It was you!

26:16.007 --> 26:19.067
Veritas latet. "Truth lies. "

26:19.177 --> 26:22.305
Latet veritas. "Lies truth. "

26:23.181 --> 26:25.741
Now, the subtle but vital difference

26:25.850 --> 26:30.583
is that this epigram translates
as "lies buried," as in "dead. "

26:30.689 --> 26:32.520
Whereas this...

26:32.624 --> 26:35.115
This means "lies at rest,"

26:35.226 --> 26:38.923
a much more benign expression,
and thus it follows

26:39.030 --> 26:44.297
that we must choose
between life... and death.

26:44.936 --> 26:45.925
That's it?

26:46.237 --> 26:48.034
That's your unassailable logic?

26:48.206 --> 26:50.071
Gregory and I
shared a passion for Latin.

26:50.175 --> 26:52.370
It follows that he would
hide the clues

26:52.477 --> 26:54.468
in the subtleties of the language.

26:55.947 --> 26:57.710
So...

26:59.784 --> 27:04.050
Either a chamber lies beyond that,
or a perfect chance

27:04.155 --> 27:09.855
for you to exact your revenge
for my past actions.

27:12.530 --> 27:15.363
Care to reconsider your choice?

27:31.249 --> 27:35.379
The second key is undoubtedly
within the second door.

27:35.487 --> 27:39.389
Indeed, this key may
unlock it outright.

27:42.027 --> 27:45.053
In which case,
you might leave me here to die.

27:47.399 --> 27:49.833
Yes.

27:49.968 --> 27:52.027
I might.

27:54.606 --> 27:56.267
Well, why don't you?

27:57.642 --> 27:59.837
Well, as I once said...

28:01.479 --> 28:06.041
...I have lost the taste for the sport.

28:23.234 --> 28:28.797
Release the first key,
the second is freed as well.

28:29.641 --> 28:31.165
Elementary, my dear Watson.

28:31.276 --> 28:33.210
Oh, shut up.

28:37.582 --> 28:40.483
There should be adequate
cellular penetration by now.

28:40.652 --> 28:42.415
What the hell's that
supposed to mean?

28:47.826 --> 28:49.794
You may begin.

28:55.500 --> 29:00.062
Cut the power.
Thought you didn't bluff, Dana.

29:01.106 --> 29:04.371
It has been an absolute pleasure
talking with you.

29:04.476 --> 29:08.469
I wish we had more time,
but it's time to say good-bye.

29:09.581 --> 29:10.980
What did you do to me?

29:11.082 --> 29:13.050
What we had to.

29:13.151 --> 29:16.279
Turns out it actually was as simple
as quenching your thirst,

29:17.522 --> 29:19.149
and I'm afraid I did lie to you.

29:20.058 --> 29:22.822
You're going to die today, Ashley.

29:45.650 --> 29:47.550
You felt...

29:47.719 --> 29:50.017
Genuine concern for me.

29:50.188 --> 29:51.815
Admit it.

29:52.056 --> 29:54.024
- Nonsense.
- Oh...

29:54.125 --> 29:57.492
- You still like me, it's so obvious.
- You tried to kill me.

29:57.962 --> 29:58.986
Yeah.

29:59.097 --> 30:02.692
But, you know,
we all hurt the ones we love.

30:05.637 --> 30:07.036
Your turn.

30:15.880 --> 30:17.245
Clara, don't stop.

30:17.415 --> 30:19.542
- I can't do this, Will. This is crazy!
- You're almost there.

30:19.717 --> 30:21.048
You're almost there.

30:30.395 --> 30:31.521
- Clara, just keep going.
- I can't do this.

30:31.696 --> 30:34.324
Focus on the goal!
Don't think about anything else!

30:34.499 --> 30:35.557
- It's just a key, okay?
- This is crazy.

30:35.667 --> 30:37.897
You're doing great!

31:17.308 --> 31:18.366
Not much of a test.

31:18.543 --> 31:20.704
You're a total daddy's girl.

31:21.913 --> 31:23.403
Helen!

31:29.354 --> 31:31.345
Alright, Father.

31:39.097 --> 31:40.587
"Two by two. "

31:40.865 --> 31:42.230
Alright.

31:50.308 --> 31:52.299
Keep going!
You're doing fine!

31:57.749 --> 31:58.773
I've got it!

31:58.883 --> 32:02.512
Okay, come on! We don't have
a lot of time, so bring it back!

32:03.154 --> 32:05.714
Two times two, two plus two,
two to the power of two,

32:05.823 --> 32:07.688
and therefore four.

32:08.793 --> 32:10.090
That is too easy.

32:10.561 --> 32:12.756
Will, I can't make it across!

32:12.931 --> 32:15.422
Clara, you're going to have to jump!
Alright? Just don't think about it!

32:15.533 --> 32:17.091
You got to jump!

32:19.137 --> 32:22.106
Clara, come on! Come on!

32:23.608 --> 32:26.202
- Where are you?
- Will, come on!

32:27.445 --> 32:30.539
Two by two. Two by two...

32:32.150 --> 32:35.449
It's not an equation.
It's a reference.

32:35.720 --> 32:40.214
Noah's ark, right? Your favorite
metaphor for your work.

32:40.391 --> 32:41.790
Right...

32:42.160 --> 32:46.688
So, what's the permutations
of abnormal life?

32:47.432 --> 32:49.059
They're endless.

32:49.467 --> 32:51.401
Therefore...

32:52.537 --> 32:55.529
Infinity.

32:57.642 --> 33:00.509
Alright, infinity.

33:10.989 --> 33:12.581
Thank you.

33:17.895 --> 33:21.387
Nice, but I think
somebody must have screwed up.

33:25.336 --> 33:27.236
Bloody hell!

33:29.173 --> 33:31.073
Move your legs, old man!

33:36.014 --> 33:37.003
Clara!

33:37.115 --> 33:39.640
Oh, no, she was right with me.

33:40.418 --> 33:42.886
Relax, Will, I'm right here.

33:42.987 --> 33:46.980
I asked you not to drop my clothes,
and look, they're filthy.

33:47.091 --> 33:48.786
Nice job, Will.

33:49.093 --> 33:52.529
- Interesting.
- Well done, William.

33:52.697 --> 33:54.255
Thanks.

33:55.033 --> 33:56.898
Where's Helen?

34:09.614 --> 34:11.581
Well done.

34:12.150 --> 34:14.118
Shall we?

34:39.811 --> 34:40.800
Finally.

34:46.751 --> 34:49.743
- I haven't seen this in a while.
- Is that it? That's the blood?

34:50.288 --> 34:54.520
The power in that vial...

34:54.926 --> 34:56.860
It could change history.

34:57.228 --> 34:59.958
Create any kind of future
we choose.

35:00.131 --> 35:01.826
- "We?"
- Don't worry.

35:01.933 --> 35:06.961
I intend to see this through...
Antivirus and all.

35:09.774 --> 35:11.173
Watson!

35:15.413 --> 35:17.142
Oh, my God...

35:17.715 --> 35:20.411
- What happened?
- Oh, the...

35:20.518 --> 35:22.315
The inevitable, I'm afraid.

35:22.487 --> 35:24.546
The suit, it stopped working.

35:25.123 --> 35:26.647
It's been failing for some time.

35:26.757 --> 35:30.818
It hasn't really worked
since we left the Sanctuary.

35:32.029 --> 35:36.261
I knew... This was a mission
I would not return from,

35:36.367 --> 35:40.360
and it was worth
one last challenge, Helen.

35:56.087 --> 35:57.179
You I shall miss.

36:02.226 --> 36:05.024
- William... William...
- Yeah...

36:07.331 --> 36:10.926
There... There is something
that we are not seeing.

36:11.035 --> 36:12.332
This was too easy.

36:12.503 --> 36:15.028
There is something
else happening,

36:15.139 --> 36:18.438
something going on
that we're not seeing.

36:19.410 --> 36:22.106
You must find
the missing piece.

36:23.514 --> 36:27.177
What? What is it?
What's the missing piece?

36:30.154 --> 36:31.985
Find it.

37:00.084 --> 37:03.611
Whoa, whoa, stay down.
Hey. Hi. It's me. It's Henry.

37:03.955 --> 37:06.116
It's Henry.
We're almost there.

37:06.224 --> 37:07.919
Listen, are you okay?

37:08.025 --> 37:10.255
You were out cold
when I found you.

37:11.095 --> 37:13.256
- I need a gun.
- Here.

37:14.932 --> 37:15.864
- Cell phone.
- Yeah.

37:15.967 --> 37:18.128
- Awesome.
- This way.

37:18.536 --> 37:19.059
What happened to you?

37:19.170 --> 37:21.900
- I don't want to talk about it. You?
- Me neither.

37:22.106 --> 37:23.573
What about the codes for Lazarus?

37:23.674 --> 37:25.164
I'm on it.

37:25.710 --> 37:28.406
I found a network interface
in this lab here.

37:28.512 --> 37:30.446
Rock star.

37:43.628 --> 37:44.287
Anything?

37:44.462 --> 37:46.191
There's a whole data
encryption package here.

37:46.430 --> 37:48.421
Looks like a lot of code.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.468
One of them should control
the dispersal unit remotely.

37:51.569 --> 37:55.096
I'm going to download the whole file
to a jump drive.

37:55.273 --> 37:55.967
How long?

37:56.140 --> 37:58.165
Just need
a couple more seconds.

37:58.342 --> 38:00.810
Ashley!
- Mom, we're ready for dust-off.

38:00.978 --> 38:02.843
- Trace this cell signal?
- Good. Stand by.

38:03.347 --> 38:05.645
Come on, come on, come on.

38:05.816 --> 38:06.805
Okay, I got it.

38:06.917 --> 38:08.544
Easy-peasy. Let's roll.

38:18.929 --> 38:21.159
This is so not good, Ash.

38:21.265 --> 38:22.857
Just give him
a few more seconds.

38:27.204 --> 38:28.330
Ashley...

38:28.506 --> 38:30.235
Hey, Mom.

38:30.708 --> 38:32.039
It was good timing.

38:34.812 --> 38:36.109
Thank you.

38:40.451 --> 38:41.748
Crap.

38:41.919 --> 38:43.011
Ashley?

38:43.120 --> 38:44.314
Get her to the infirmary.

38:46.357 --> 38:47.517
What the hell happened to her?

38:47.692 --> 38:50.058
I don't know.
We were separated a long time.

38:57.101 --> 39:01.868
See, you're supposed to say,
"Hey, Clara, you did great.

39:01.972 --> 39:04.202
Way to conquer your fears. "

39:04.308 --> 39:08.244
I'm sorry, I'm just...
thinking about stuff.

39:08.346 --> 39:11.213
You did do great.

39:11.682 --> 39:14.048
Thanks for taking off your pants.

39:15.152 --> 39:16.983
You never have to thank me
for that.

39:20.691 --> 39:23.751
I can't believe this place. I...

39:23.994 --> 39:27.862
I thought I was a one-off. A freak.

39:31.669 --> 39:34.968
Clara, why don't you stay here?
I mean, just for a while,

39:35.072 --> 39:39.668
just to see what it's like
to be part of something.

39:39.844 --> 39:41.277
Yeah, I... I don't know.

39:41.379 --> 39:46.407
Being connected to places
and people...

39:46.517 --> 39:48.382
It's not really my style.

39:48.552 --> 39:52.010
Well, that's because neither
was accepting of who you are.

39:52.123 --> 39:54.956
I think that's going to change.

40:05.970 --> 40:07.164
I had to do that.

40:10.074 --> 40:13.407
The view is just way too romantic.

40:14.145 --> 40:16.613
Yeah, I know what you mean.

40:19.784 --> 40:21.809
How is she?

40:23.354 --> 40:25.322
She's unconscious.

40:25.923 --> 40:28.983
Something's wrong.
Her blood pressure's elevated.

40:29.093 --> 40:31.527
- I need to run more tests.
- They've done something to her.

40:33.330 --> 40:35.423
She'll be alright, John.

40:35.900 --> 40:37.925
She's strong.

40:38.736 --> 40:42.797
I'd like to stay close,
if you don't mind.

40:44.108 --> 40:46.167
Of course.

40:46.911 --> 40:48.538
John...

40:50.514 --> 40:52.641
Thank you.

41:05.863 --> 41:07.353
What is it, Will?

41:08.165 --> 41:10.861
Something Watson said
before he died.

41:10.968 --> 41:13.960
About it all being too easy,
that we'd missed something.

41:14.071 --> 41:16.505
We got the blood.
It seems like a win to me.

41:16.607 --> 41:18.575
Yeah, but...

41:18.676 --> 41:21.372
I just can't shake the feeling
that he's right,

41:21.479 --> 41:25.415
that there's something else going on
that we just can't see.

41:29.153 --> 41:31.781
I have to talk to Magnus.

41:37.595 --> 41:39.187
Nicola!

41:46.070 --> 41:47.435
What the...?

41:51.976 --> 41:53.273
Oh, no.

41:54.245 --> 41:57.339
Doc, the drive we brought back,
it's all fakey ghost data.

41:57.515 --> 41:59.346
There's no codes, there's no info,
there's nothing we can use.

42:00.651 --> 42:01.379
Doc?

42:04.488 --> 42:06.547
Isn't this just like you, John?

42:06.657 --> 42:09.421
Steal what we need the most, and
then stick around to gloat about it.

42:09.593 --> 42:12.221
I have been here the whole time.

42:19.837 --> 42:21.498
Ashley.

42:25.476 --> 42:27.603
Magnus... Magnus!

42:29.046 --> 42:31.742
The whole thing, it was a set-up.

42:32.149 --> 42:34.913
Something else is going on.

42:35.452 --> 42:37.613
We're too late.

42:59.777 --> 43:01.472
Thank you, Ashley.

43:01.579 --> 43:05.071
You've been everything
we could have hoped for.

43:05.416 --> 43:08.351
Welcome to your rebirth.
