-You've been working so much.

00:11.345 --> 00:13.387
[Laine] DOD's trying
to save an old base.

00:13.387 --> 00:16.804
Hmm, it'll be an erosion study,
probably a swinging gate.

00:16.804 --> 00:20.387
-Where is it?
-Montauk.

00:20.387 --> 00:22.845

-[Joanie] Almost.

06:22.220 --> 06:25.261
There we go.
That's better.

06:25.261 --> 06:27.720
I'm studying some
of Montauk's older families.

06:27.720 --> 06:29.428
I'm an epigeneticist.

06:29.428 --> 06:31.970
The plot where you were standing
actually belongs to a family

06:31.970 --> 06:35.428
I'm super interested in; I've
been studying them for years.

06:35.428 --> 06:37.470
But, uh, I didn't
want to walk over

-Still no?

06:55.303 --> 06:58.178
What's so interesting
about the Lockharts?

06:58.178 --> 07:00.553
Well, I study trauma, so...

07:00.553 --> 07:02.929
So...?

07:02.929 --> 07:05.970
And how it gets passed
down from generation

07:05.970 --> 07:08.387
to generation.

07:10.303 --> 07:13.220
I mean, the whole
family is steeped

07:13.220 --> 07:15.178
in cyclical tragedy.

07:15.178 --> 07:17.553
Murder, drowning, suicide,

07:17.553 --> 07:19.053
more murder, more drowning,
more suicide--

07:19.053 --> 07:20.345

No.

07:31.053 --> 07:32.804
-Why not?
-I have to work.

07:32.804 --> 07:35.136
Well, after work. After you
work, we'll go to dinner.

07:35.136 --> 07:36.804
And... don't get any ideas.

07:36.804 --> 07:38.428
Okay? This is just

07:38.428 --> 07:40.929
-so I can interview you.
-No.

07:40.929 --> 07:44.804
That's what your dad said
at first, but he came around.

07:44.804 --> 07:47.220
You know, you two have
very similar scowls.

07:47.220 --> 07:48.595
Do you get that a lot?

07:49.970 --> 07:51.428
-You knew my dad?
-Sure I did.

07:51.428 --> 07:53.011
I interviewed him.

07:53.011 --> 07:56.178
Nobody knew the history
of Montauk like he did.

07:57.428 --> 07:59.637
How did you...?

08:00.470 --> 08:02.011
How did I what?

08:02.011 --> 08:03.679
Know him? Meet him? Find him?

08:03.679 --> 08:06.261
Never mind.

08:06.261 --> 08:09.095
I found him to be
pretty happy,

08:09.095 --> 08:11.512
for what it's worth.

08:19.595 --> 08:22.387
I never understood why
he loved it so much out here.

08:22.387 --> 08:25.428
[chuckles] The more
this place deteriorated,

08:25.428 --> 08:26.720
the more summer
people abandoned it,

08:26.720 --> 08:28.929
the happier he got.

08:28.929 --> 08:32.178
Said it brought him back to the
Montauk he remembered as a kid.

08:32.178 --> 08:35.553
It was becoming a small
fishing town all over again.

08:37.970 --> 08:40.095
Yeah.

08:40.095 --> 08:42.720
That was my dad.

08:42.720 --> 08:44.553
♪♪♪

08:52.595 --> 08:55.220
There's this misconception
that trauma can be inherited

08:55.220 --> 08:56.512
from one generation
to the next.

08:56.512 --> 08:58.845
That's not exactly true,
but what is true

08:58.845 --> 09:01.512
is that children of parents
who have experienced trauma

09:01.512 --> 09:03.011
are more likely to be, uh,

09:03.011 --> 09:04.553
easily triggered
by their own stressors

09:04.553 --> 09:06.887
than children of
un-traumatized parents.

09:06.887 --> 09:09.428
So, like, if you and I both
experience a traumatic event,

09:09.428 --> 09:12.512
you might be
more likely to, uh, develop

09:12.512 --> 09:15.303
anxiety attacks
or, uh, PTSD

09:15.303 --> 09:16.929
around the memory of it
than I would

09:16.929 --> 09:18.595
because your parents were
traumatized and mine weren't.

09:20.178 --> 09:21.679
Well, hypothetically.

09:23.220 --> 09:25.220
The pattern is pretty clear.

09:25.220 --> 09:29.804
Children of traumatized parents
are just more sensitive.

09:29.804 --> 09:32.095
They feel stress and danger
more acutely

09:32.095 --> 09:34.720
because they're primed to.

09:34.720 --> 09:37.136
Okay, here's the theory
I'm testing:

09:37.136 --> 09:38.970
in some of the families
that I've studied,

09:38.970 --> 09:41.470
there is a black sheep
of a child

09:41.470 --> 09:43.053
who turns out to be
extra resilient.

09:43.053 --> 09:46.845
So, like, instead of inheriting
the anxiety of a trauma victim,

09:46.845 --> 09:50.095
they seem to inherit
the resilience of a survivor.

09:50.095 --> 09:52.178
What I don't know...

09:52.178 --> 09:56.095
what I'm trying to figure out
is how to predict.

09:56.095 --> 09:57.053
How do you know...

09:57.053 --> 09:58.387
which child will be weaker

09:58.387 --> 10:00.220
and which child
will be stronger?

10:00.220 --> 10:02.804
Is the trauma more dominant
than the resilience gene?

10:02.804 --> 10:04.887
Or is it the other way around?

10:04.887 --> 10:08.095
And-and how does nurture
play into all of this?

10:10.470 --> 10:13.887
Like, for example,
which are you?

10:13.887 --> 10:16.595
What?

10:16.595 --> 10:18.595
You seem tough.

10:18.595 --> 10:20.470
Really tough.

10:20.470 --> 10:22.804
Uh, which would
suggest resilience.

10:22.804 --> 10:24.845
But, um...

10:24.845 --> 10:26.762
you're not that interested
in my work, are you?

10:26.762 --> 10:28.720
No, not really.

10:28.720 --> 10:32.220
Cool, cool, cool, cool.

10:32.220 --> 10:35.053
So, uh...

10:35.053 --> 10:37.720
what are you doing
with those thingies?

10:37.720 --> 10:41.553
These are nanosensors.

10:41.553 --> 10:44.011
They're basically
trackable granules of sand.

10:44.011 --> 10:46.387
Studying their movements

10:46.387 --> 10:48.720
will help me predict how fast
the coast is eroding.

10:48.720 --> 10:51.512
So what's the verdict
on the erosion?

10:52.595 --> 10:55.512
[sighs]
I don't know yet, EJ.

10:55.512 --> 10:58.762
As you can see,
I'm still gathering data.

10:58.762 --> 11:00.804
I hope it doesn't
disappear too fast.

11:00.804 --> 11:02.762
I love it out here.

11:02.762 --> 11:04.845
I'm actually thinking
about buying a house,

11:04.845 --> 11:06.887
property values being so low

11:06.887 --> 11:09.762
and everything.

11:09.762 --> 11:12.011
Oh, so you're insane.

11:12.011 --> 11:13.512
How so?

11:13.512 --> 11:17.345
Montauk is built
on a pile of sand.

11:17.345 --> 11:19.553
Not granite, sand.

11:19.553 --> 11:22.762
In fact,
the whole of Long Island

11:22.762 --> 11:25.136
is basically
just the result of glaciers

11:25.136 --> 11:27.887
bulldozing their way across New
England, bringing sediment up

11:27.887 --> 11:30.470
from the ocean floor and
pushing it into a pile

11:30.470 --> 11:32.387
the way a child would
make a sandcastle.

11:33.804 --> 11:35.553
I don't know
how fast it's eroding,

11:35.553 --> 11:37.387
but I do know,
in about ten or 20 years

11:37.387 --> 11:39.261
all this is gonna be gone.

11:39.261 --> 11:41.303
You'd be crazy
to buy anything out here,

11:41.303 --> 11:43.303
especially a piece
of property.

11:43.303 --> 11:44.679
But isn't that why you're here?

11:46.887 --> 11:49.720
You're a coastal engineer,
right?

11:49.720 --> 11:52.720
Isn't it your job to save
the world from drowning?

11:55.845 --> 11:57.679
Hey, where are you going?

11:57.679 --> 11:59.804
Home. I'm done.

12:05.887 --> 12:08.387
Hey, did I offend
you back there?

12:08.387 --> 12:10.595
I wasn't trying to.
