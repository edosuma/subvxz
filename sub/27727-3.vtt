(TRAIN WHISTLE BLASTS)

01:01.360 --> 01:03.840
JEREMY: Look at that.
That is a sturdy car,
that is.

01:03.920 --> 01:06.920
JAMES: Isn't that
a very popular car
with the gay community?

01:07.000 --> 01:08.360
JEREMY: Is it?

01:08.440 --> 01:10.000
JAMES: It's Hammond.
JEREMY: That is Hammond.

01:10.080 --> 01:14.000
-Is that your car?
-Yes, this is my car.

01:14.080 --> 01:15.360
Why is your car there?

01:15.440 --> 01:17.280
Because that's where
the boat dropped me off?

01:17.360 --> 01:18.840
They got to here,
wrapped it in polythene,

01:18.920 --> 01:21.280
lobbed it over the side,
me with it.
That's how they do it.

01:21.400 --> 01:23.160
What's it say on that?
"Global Auto"?

01:23.200 --> 01:24.560
Yeah, GAK.

01:24.680 --> 01:26.480
That's what they said
was the company.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.760
JAMES: I bought it from
an English family

01:29.840 --> 01:32.880
-who had bought a house
in Tuscany.
-Tony Blair.

01:32.960 --> 01:34.760
-Cherie Blair.
-Sting.

01:34.840 --> 01:38.360
Every single lightweight
socialist in Britain

01:38.440 --> 01:41.280
has been in this car.

01:41.360 --> 01:42.960
We're now
leaving Cartagena

01:43.040 --> 01:48.240
in our quest to find
many interesting animals
to photograph.

01:48.320 --> 01:51.560
Well, shrimping
and forest products
obviously, er...pays well.

01:51.640 --> 01:54.240
-Look at the boats out there.
JAMES: I know,
that is amazing, isn't it?

01:54.320 --> 01:56.880
You often see that. The
most humble of commodities

01:56.960 --> 01:59.760
and it yields
just incredible wealth.

-Argh!
-Turn it off!

02:06.320 --> 02:10.520
JEREMY: It is one of the most
stupid pieces of engineering
ever, that truck.

02:12.520 --> 02:15.040
Right, Jaguars, they are
very difficult to spot

02:15.120 --> 02:17.880
and very, very rare.

02:18.000 --> 02:19.760
This is proper jungle now.

-(CLUNKS)
-Oh, dear.

02:22.720 --> 02:24.440
I think I've just
lost the exhaust pipe.

02:26.440 --> 02:28.080
JEREMY:
What are we going to do?

02:28.160 --> 02:32.000
People could
come out here for 40 years
and not see a jaguar.

02:32.080 --> 02:34.080
RICHARD: Well, we could
use my trap cameras.

02:35.520 --> 02:37.880
-He parked his car there.
-Yes.

02:38.000 --> 02:39.960
-Turn it round.
-Oh, that'll mess
with his head.

02:40.040 --> 02:42.160
So he comes down
in the morning.
Imagine his face.

02:42.240 --> 02:43.440
He'll think he's gone mad.

02:43.520 --> 02:46.520
One, two, three. Move it.

02:46.600 --> 02:47.960
One, two...

02:48.040 --> 02:50.360
Did we get any pictures?

02:50.440 --> 02:53.400
-Right. Ah, look, there!
-That's it!

02:53.480 --> 02:54.680
There's his head,
there's his head.

02:54.760 --> 02:56.520
That's the ace of spades,
the jaguar.

02:56.600 --> 02:58.640
That's Saddam Hussein.

02:58.720 --> 03:03.080
We've now gotta
go and get his sons,
Uday... and the other one.

03:03.160 --> 03:05.080
What was
his other son called?

03:05.160 --> 03:06.360
Edgar.

03:09.080 --> 03:10.600
JEREMY:
With the jaguar in the bag,

03:10.680 --> 03:13.520
our sights were set
on the next target,

03:13.600 --> 03:15.560
another rare and
reclusive creature.

03:16.640 --> 03:18.640
The spectacled bear.

03:19.960 --> 03:22.840
We now have to drive
200 miles

03:22.920 --> 03:24.520
to find the sort of terrain

03:24.600 --> 03:28.160
where we're gonna be
able to photograph

03:28.240 --> 03:31.480

Edgar Hussein.

03:34.800 --> 03:38.720
To help pass the time,
entertainment was
provided by James,

03:38.800 --> 03:42.440
trying to overtake trucks
in his one-litre Panda.

03:43.880 --> 03:46.880
Right. No.

03:46.960 --> 03:50.560
He can't see past them
cos his steering wheel's
on the correct side.

03:50.640 --> 03:53.240
JAMES: Cor, bloody hellfire.

03:53.320 --> 03:55.040
So he has to
lunge out of the...
(LAUGHS)

03:55.120 --> 04:00.280
..and then there's this
ridiculously roarty noise
as he sets off.

Oh-ho, I enjoyed
watching that one.

04:15.400 --> 04:18.320
Right, blokes,
I can't keep this
lorry-overtaking up all day.

-My ring piece
is gonna be in tatters.

04:23.160 --> 04:25.200
What is wrong
with this bloke?

what he's been taking,
but he's all over the shop.

04:29.200 --> 04:31.560
He's had a lot of shrimp.
The man's a... an idiot.

04:52.920 --> 04:56.640
Oh, God.

04:56.720 --> 05:01.360
Just had a message
asking if I'd like to go back
and help Mr Hammond,

05:01.480 --> 05:04.920
er, mend his monster truck.

05:05.000 --> 05:07.000
Let me think about that.

05:08.480 --> 05:09.760
No, I wouldn't.

05:11.520 --> 05:13.320
Out you come.

Air-conditioning radiator.

05:15.760 --> 05:17.080
Useless.

05:17.160 --> 05:19.520
Still, could be worse.

05:19.600 --> 05:21.600
Could be him over there.

05:21.680 --> 05:22.800
Yeah.

05:22.880 --> 05:25.800
My guess is his brakes
have failed

05:25.880 --> 05:28.640
and he's hooked a wheel
over there to stop it
rolling back.

05:31.200 --> 05:33.200
Er, is this you?

05:34.240 --> 05:35.320

-Gracias.

the world's greatest linguist
got his truck going...

06:00.960 --> 06:02.960
and caught us up.

06:07.680 --> 06:13.240
And the next morning
we all woke in the pretty
hill town of Villa de Leyva.

06:29.240 --> 06:31.720

to all my trousers?

You said you were hot.

06:33.920 --> 06:35.400
Well, I am now.

06:35.480 --> 06:37.360
(BELL CONTINUES TO RING)

06:46.800 --> 06:50.120
It's a Sunday morning in
a Spanish-speaking country.

06:50.200 --> 06:52.440
It's 8:15 am.

06:52.520 --> 06:55.520
Chances of a trouser shop
being open...?

06:55.600 --> 06:57.280
Nil.

06:57.360 --> 06:58.480
Jeremy.

06:58.560 --> 07:00.600
-Morning.
-How you doing?

07:00.680 --> 07:02.560
Very good.
Sorry, that's not...

07:02.640 --> 07:06.040
James and Richard
cut my trousers up.

07:06.120 --> 07:08.760
Why do I have to be
recognised here,
for God's sake?

07:11.120 --> 07:15.480

crisis, we continued onwards.

And eventually we arrived

Right, now, listen.

07:42.000 --> 07:44.120
RICHARD: Erm...
JAMES: Ho-ho-ho-ho.
-There's a lot to do.

07:44.200 --> 07:45.840
-What?
-I don't like your trousers.

07:45.920 --> 07:47.880
Well, no,
at least he's trying.
He's making an effort.

07:47.960 --> 07:49.320
You should have
gone the whole hog.

07:49.400 --> 07:50.800
Maybe some nice...
Hey, we're out--

07:50.880 --> 07:52.680
We're in the
outdoors, some nice chaps.

07:52.760 --> 07:54.960
Suede,
but ventilated at the back.

07:55.040 --> 07:57.280
And that shirt.
You've picked up that colour.

07:57.360 --> 07:59.000
Have you been getting advice?

07:59.080 --> 08:01.440
May we turn our attention to
the bears now, to Paddington?

08:01.520 --> 08:02.960
Your skin's flaking.

08:03.040 --> 08:05.080
-You should moisturise.
-It's... What?

08:05.160 --> 08:06.920
-You should moisturise.
-You should moisturise
a little bit.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.800
-Why should I moisturise?
-Because
your skin's flaking off.

08:08.880 --> 08:12.160
Because you're dry.
You look like something
found in a pyramid.

08:12.240 --> 08:14.840
Anyway, listen,
we must turn our attention...

08:14.920 --> 08:17.640
-(RICHARD LAUGHS)
-We must turn
our attention...

"Let's have a look
at the sarcophagus.

-"I'm not putting that
in the British Museum."

08:24.680 --> 08:27.880
Rather than put up with
any more of this persecution,

08:27.960 --> 08:32.560
I insisted we saddle up
and set off
to look for Paddington.

08:34.640 --> 08:36.920
I don't actually know... I've
seen a picture of these bears

08:37.000 --> 08:40.640
but I don't actually know
how big they are. Are they
two feet or ten feet?

08:40.720 --> 08:43.720
I just don't know.

08:43.760 --> 08:46.720
Keep it diagonal, obviously,
while crossing these things.

08:47.840 --> 08:49.520
-(CREAKING)
-Oh, shite!

08:49.640 --> 08:51.280
RICHARD:
Oh-ho!

08:51.360 --> 08:53.880
Oh-ho! Look at you
with a wheel in the air!

08:53.960 --> 08:56.360
Can we please try not to make
this look like it's a problem

08:56.440 --> 08:58.520
cos the ladies and gentlemen
will think we're hopeless.

09:00.400 --> 09:03.240
JEREMY:
I tried to drive myself out.

09:03.320 --> 09:05.280
Which went well.

09:05.360 --> 09:08.360
-Speed and power.
-(LAUGHS) He's just
dug himself a hole!

09:08.440 --> 09:10.520
So I asked Hammond for help.

09:10.600 --> 09:13.120
But, predictably,
his pickup truck

09:13.200 --> 09:16.720
chose that moment to
go into one-wheel drive.

09:19.440 --> 09:21.400
Oh...

09:21.480 --> 09:23.520
Oh, dear.

09:23.600 --> 09:26.760
There was only one solution.

09:26.880 --> 09:28.320
-Could you give me
a tow cos...
-No.

09:28.400 --> 09:30.040
No, I'm very close
to coming out.

09:30.120 --> 09:32.320
-Well, we know that.
You've bought a Jeep.
-Yes, no, that's...

09:32.400 --> 09:34.400
-Oh, I see.
-(LAUGHS)

09:37.520 --> 09:41.520
Every single time
I open my mouth now,
you've got some reference...

09:41.600 --> 09:43.760
No, it's great. It's good.

09:43.880 --> 09:45.880
We're all friends.

09:45.960 --> 09:49.440
With the rope hitched up,
we were ready to go.

09:49.520 --> 09:51.520
So I'll give you a small tug.

09:51.600 --> 09:53.960
-Was that a gentle tug?
-There we go.

09:54.040 --> 09:57.640
And then it's down to you
because I haven't got the
weight to pull you, OK?

09:57.760 --> 09:59.760
Here we go, three, two, one.

10:02.640 --> 10:04.640
-Whoa!
RICHARD: Exciting.

10:06.640 --> 10:08.760
Yes, go on!

10:08.880 --> 10:12.120
-A Fiat Panda!
-Yesssss!
JAMES: Yes!

10:12.200 --> 10:15.200
Jeremy Corbyn just pulled
Freddy Mercury out.

10:15.280 --> 10:17.640
It's a meeting of minds.

10:17.720 --> 10:19.720
(LAUGHS)

10:21.200 --> 10:23.200
I'm not sure we're
very good at fist-bumping.

10:26.640 --> 10:28.760
JEREMY:
With that calamity sorted,

10:28.880 --> 10:33.000
Hammond got
four-wheel drive back
and we resumed our mission.

10:34.640 --> 10:36.880
Right.

10:36.960 --> 10:39.760
Go on a bear hunt.

10:39.840 --> 10:41.520
Soon, however...

10:41.600 --> 10:43.600
(CLANKING)

10:46.240 --> 10:47.960
-(CLANKING CONTINUES)
-Oh, dear.

10:50.520 --> 10:53.120
What's up, Hammond?

10:53.200 --> 10:57.640
RICHARD:
I think something's broken
somewhere in the drive line.

10:57.760 --> 11:00.600
Am I now having to pull
Hammond... Oh, God.

11:00.680 --> 11:04.000
Right, and pull Hammond out.

11:04.080 --> 11:08.680
RICHARD: Once my pickup
had been pulled out...

11:08.760 --> 11:11.520
I quickly found the fault.

11:11.600 --> 11:13.440
Broken the half shaft.

11:13.520 --> 11:15.640
JAMES: Ohhh!

11:15.720 --> 11:17.880
RICHARD: I think this is now
a two-wheel drive.

11:20.360 --> 11:23.360
JEREMY: Still, while there
had been a few mishaps,

11:23.440 --> 11:28.680
our cars were able to
take us comfortably to a
suitable bear-spotting point.

11:35.160 --> 11:38.680
I've got a cool-box in the
back of the Jeep full of
zesty, refreshing drinks.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.560
The temperature's perfect.

11:42.640 --> 11:44.840
I'm not out of breath.
I didn't have to walk here.

11:46.200 --> 11:48.200
However, because
the trap cameras

11:48.280 --> 11:50.160
had been ruined
by the jaguar,

11:50.240 --> 11:54.000
this time
we would need to deploy
our immense patience.

12:02.280 --> 12:04.440
Soon, however...

12:04.520 --> 12:06.200
I'm bored!

12:06.280 --> 12:08.440
-I'm bored!
JAMES: Bored.

12:08.520 --> 12:11.320
Booooooored!

12:14.520 --> 12:18.440
JEREMY: So, to make life
more interesting,
we kept on driving.

12:22.760 --> 12:25.080
Right, we go higher up
the mountain.

12:34.360 --> 12:40.560
This is the absolute
worst terrain
for the Jeep's suspension.

12:40.640 --> 12:44.440
God, I'd like to meet the man
who put these big tyres
on this thing.

12:44.520 --> 12:47.120
And I'd like to strangle him.

12:47.200 --> 12:50.000
Still, could be worse.

12:50.080 --> 12:51.360
-Hole.
-(THUD)

12:53.600 --> 12:56.280
-Oh, dear.
-(LAUGHS)

12:56.360 --> 12:58.560
Looks like Jeremy Corbyn's
struggling a bit there.

12:58.640 --> 13:00.640
(REVVING)

13:02.760 --> 13:05.840
No, somehow he's managed to
get it back on its wheels.

13:13.280 --> 13:15.640
And still it goes!

13:17.360 --> 13:19.200
JAMES: But then...

13:19.280 --> 13:21.520
Oh, God.

13:21.600 --> 13:23.600
Oh, hold on.

13:24.600 --> 13:26.600
Big hole there, chaps.

13:29.160 --> 13:30.840
-Yeah, you see that...
JAMES: Oh-ho-ho.

13:32.640 --> 13:34.400
JEREMY: That's not...
What are you on about?

13:34.480 --> 13:36.160
-It's massive!
-That's quite a big hole.

13:36.240 --> 13:39.160
-It just isn't,
though, is it?
-Other than that it is.

13:39.240 --> 13:41.440
-Look at the size of it.
JAMES: Although...
JEREMY: Look.

13:41.520 --> 13:44.520
RICHARD: No, that's...
JEREMY: No, stop
and listen to the expert.

13:44.600 --> 13:46.960
Cut it this way.

13:47.040 --> 13:51.360
Gravity gets you down there
and then you simply
drive up the other side.

13:51.440 --> 13:54.640
Oh, Professor, how do you
work these things out?

13:54.720 --> 13:56.400
-You drive out.
-Look at your tyres.

13:56.480 --> 13:59.240
-Yeah, Hammond,
that's a monster truck.
-Only two are driven.

13:59.320 --> 14:01.240
-It's a monster truck!
-It runs over cars.

14:01.320 --> 14:02.960
I've seen them do it
on the telly.

14:03.040 --> 14:05.120
-And they're two-wheel drive.
-They are, actually. Yes.

14:05.200 --> 14:09.880
They are two-wheel drive
and they... Monster trucks
could easily do that.

14:09.960 --> 14:14.760
With Hammond refusing
point blank to help, James
and I did manual labour,

14:14.840 --> 14:18.080
and cut away the edge
of the bank.

14:18.160 --> 14:20.280
Keep going, chaps, you'll
fill the hole in eventually.

14:20.360 --> 14:22.960
What about that then,
Hammond? That's softened it
up a bit. Fancy that?

14:23.040 --> 14:25.960
It's easy now.
I'll do it in a Lamborghini.

14:26.040 --> 14:28.560
That's got rid of
that big stony bit.

14:28.640 --> 14:30.840
That's roughly where
your wheel's gonna go.

14:30.920 --> 14:32.880
Yeah, just before
the massive drop.

14:32.960 --> 14:36.240
Ever since
your last accident,
you've lost your bottle.

14:36.320 --> 14:38.280
No, it doesn't require
bottle to do that.

14:38.360 --> 14:41.280
It can't be done.
It's not the same.

14:41.360 --> 14:42.880
Well, you're gonna do it.

14:42.960 --> 14:44.320
-No, I'm not.
-You are.

14:44.400 --> 14:46.520
No, I'm not.

14:46.600 --> 14:48.600
Right, here we go.

14:50.600 --> 14:51.880
Gravity will
get you in a minute.

14:51.960 --> 14:54.800
Yes, I know gravity works.
I'm familiar with it.

14:54.880 --> 14:56.960
Just do it and then drive up
the other side.

14:57.040 --> 14:59.040
Hurry up, quicker.

15:01.320 --> 15:02.920
Oh, God!

15:03.000 --> 15:05.520
-There you go.
-Exactly as I said.

15:05.600 --> 15:07.880
Now drive up the other side.

15:07.960 --> 15:09.960

-You know that sort of roll
bar thing he's got there.
-Yeah.

15:59.480 --> 16:01.160
If we get the sand ladders
from the support truck

16:01.240 --> 16:04.240
and lay them on that,
we could drive across him.

-Couldn't we?
-Isambard Kingdom May.

16:10.400 --> 16:12.400

a brilliant idea.

16:14.440 --> 16:16.600
I don't know
what they're gonna do.

it's not gonna work.

our magnificent bridge

16:52.440 --> 16:54.080

And James volunteered
to cross it first.

17:02.520 --> 17:05.240
JEREMY: Come on, Hammond,
you must be pleased.

17:05.320 --> 17:07.320
No, I'm not pleased!

First heroic thing it's done.

-Yes!

-Piece of cake.
-Oh, no fist bumping.

17:33.560 --> 17:35.800
-Oh, no, we don't
do that, do we, yeah.
-That hurt.

17:35.880 --> 17:38.040

Now, though, it was my turn,

in a car that was
more than twice the weight
of the Panda.

you've stopped me

lift a finger, even though
he'd got us into this mess,

-Yeah.
-Blocked.

20:02.720 --> 20:03.960
But you've been gone...

20:04.040 --> 20:05.560
So what was
the point in that?

20:05.680 --> 20:07.520
Well, at least it meant
your car was useful twice.

20:07.560 --> 20:09.000
-It was.
-Well, you ended up
where you...

20:09.080 --> 20:10.720
We've achieved nothing,

20:10.800 --> 20:12.520
apart from ruining my truck
and turning it into a bridge.

20:12.560 --> 20:14.680
Yeah, but we needed to do
that to get back again.

20:14.760 --> 20:17.280
-Exactly.
-But if you hadn't gone...

20:17.320 --> 20:20.440
If you hadn't gone there,
you wouldn't need a bridge
to get back, would you?

20:20.520 --> 20:22.960
JAMES: We didn't know
there was a river there
until we'd gone there.

20:23.040 --> 20:26.880
-And there are no bears.

was getting us nowhere,

20:26.960 --> 20:31.080
we pulled an ungrateful
Hammond out of his hole,

20:31.200 --> 20:33.880
and found another route
up the mountain.

to seeing a bear,
I really am.

20:41.960 --> 20:45.720

polar bears, which I hate.

they eat schoolchildren.

another suitable spot,

20:53.040 --> 20:55.800
where I discovered
I had a small problem.

20:57.480 --> 21:00.720
I'm still not high enough up
to see over the shrubs.

about it now.

25:37.600 --> 25:39.760
is some kind of ladder,

25:39.840 --> 25:43.680
so I get some elevation
for the photography,

25:43.760 --> 25:46.760
and a chair to sit on,
and a roof.

25:48.800 --> 25:50.720
RICHARD: Oh, gold dust.

25:50.800 --> 25:52.440
Look at that.

25:52.520 --> 25:54.520
That is perfect.

25:54.600 --> 25:59.320
So, um, can I have 20 metres?

25:59.400 --> 26:01.400
Vingt me...?

26:03.240 --> 26:05.200
That's not a good sign,
is it?

26:05.280 --> 26:08.960
(MUSICAL BLAST FROM HORN)

26:09.040 --> 26:14.040
JEREMY: As we went about
our shopping, I received a
rather intriguing phone call.

26:15.840 --> 26:17.800
This afternoon?

26:17.880 --> 26:19.960
Sure. OK.

26:20.040 --> 26:21.440
All right, bye.

26:21.520 --> 26:23.160
Er, that was
our Colombian fixers.

26:23.240 --> 26:25.840
They say, um, this afternoon
they want us to try something

26:25.920 --> 26:30.480
which is, they say...
the thing that Colombia
is most famous for.

26:34.160 --> 26:36.000
Yep.

26:36.080 --> 26:37.880
Football.

26:37.960 --> 26:42.800
Specifically a match
between The Grand Tour
team...

26:42.880 --> 26:45.320
and our Colombian fixers.

26:45.400 --> 26:50.280
Hammond, with his gammy knee,
couldn't play, so made
himself our manager.

26:50.360 --> 26:56.160
So, we're gonna play
a five-four-four?

26:56.240 --> 26:57.880
JEREMY: I doubt it.
-Five-four-three?

26:57.960 --> 26:59.320
MAN: Eight, nine?
-Five... Two?

26:59.400 --> 27:01.200
-How many on our team?
-It's eight a side.

27:01.280 --> 27:02.880
Three. Right, well,
we're gonna play...

27:02.960 --> 27:07.360
-Drop the five, then.
-Three... four.

27:07.440 --> 27:09.440
Three.

27:09.520 --> 27:11.160
JEREMY: With the crowd
of onlookers

27:11.240 --> 27:15.320
at fever pitch,
the game began.

27:15.400 --> 27:17.880
(WHISTLE)

27:17.960 --> 27:23.840
And since I was our biggest
player, from any angle,
I was put in goal.

27:23.920 --> 27:25.920
Which went well.

27:35.000 --> 27:38.040
Also,
the ref was pretty harsh.

27:38.120 --> 27:40.280
-(WHISTLE)
-What?

27:40.360 --> 27:41.800
How can it be handball?

27:41.880 --> 27:44.720
He hasn't got a hand!

27:44.800 --> 27:46.400
-(WHISTLE)
-The match continued

27:46.480 --> 27:49.080
with some good clean tackles
from us.

27:50.480 --> 27:52.760
(WHISTLE)

27:52.840 --> 27:55.280
And eventually
an actual goal.

27:57.520 --> 27:58.680
-(CHEERING)
-(WHISTLE)

27:58.760 --> 28:02.960
But my goalkeeping continued
to let the side down.

28:03.040 --> 28:05.040
-Oh, come on!
-(WHISTLE)

28:06.480 --> 28:08.680
-(WHISTLE)
-(CLAPPING)

28:08.760 --> 28:11.320
And even though
I'd given my all...

28:11.400 --> 28:14.280
(COUGHS) I've just coughed
my lungs up.

28:14.360 --> 28:18.600
I was eventually substituted
for our special forces
security guy,

28:18.680 --> 28:23.360
who did well,
despite his pixelated face.

28:23.440 --> 28:27.080
(CHEERING)

28:27.160 --> 28:30.760
-We may as well modify our
cars now. We're not playing.
-Yeah.

28:30.840 --> 28:33.840
The only problem is,
nobody'll be able to film us.

28:33.920 --> 28:36.640
Cos they're playing football.
And they are not stopping.

28:36.720 --> 28:38.800
Why don't we just quietly
leave them to it?

28:38.880 --> 28:42.240
-We'll get on with it.
JAMES: It's not as if
anyone's gonna miss us.

28:43.480 --> 28:45.920
(GRUNTING)

28:47.040 --> 28:49.040
-Go on, Nick!
-(WHISTLE)

28:56.320 --> 28:58.080
JEREMY:
The next morning, happily,

28:58.160 --> 29:01.960
the uninjured members of our
film crew were back at work.

29:03.320 --> 29:06.680
-Was it really six-two?
-Yeah.

29:06.760 --> 29:08.640
-It was.
-Yeah.

29:08.720 --> 29:11.280
I think the problem was
they substituted me and you
too early.

29:11.360 --> 29:13.520
-I think so.
-Anyway, listen...

29:13.600 --> 29:15.440
We've now got
the film crews back,

29:15.520 --> 29:17.760
so let's set them to work
doing what they can do,

29:17.840 --> 29:19.640
and have a look at our cars.

29:19.720 --> 29:21.840
-OK, you have to find mine.
-Where is it?

29:21.920 --> 29:24.320
Yours is the one disguised
as a bush
in an industrial car park.

29:24.400 --> 29:26.800
-I've camouflaged it.
-Well, yes,
you've painted it.

29:26.880 --> 29:30.040
It's got roll-down netting
that goes over the windows
when I'm using it as a hide

29:30.120 --> 29:33.080
and it has an inbuilt...
Well, it's got a raise
on it as well,

29:33.160 --> 29:35.760
cos the one problem
I've had is ground clearance.

29:35.840 --> 29:37.240
-Yeah.
-What?

29:37.320 --> 29:39.120
You've spent two days
laughing at Hammond and me

29:39.200 --> 29:41.080
cos we've got cars
that have been raised,

29:41.160 --> 29:43.880
and how awful they are,
and then you've done
exactly the same.

29:43.960 --> 29:47.600
As an alternative expression,
rather than
"I'm going to raise my car,"

29:47.680 --> 29:50.560
-why not, "I'm going to
ruin my car"?
-Yes.

29:50.640 --> 29:52.120
-What you've done
is ruined it.
-Let's see.

29:52.200 --> 29:53.840
I've done it very subtly.

29:53.920 --> 29:56.720
How do you think Tony Blair
and Gordon Sting
are going to feel

29:56.800 --> 30:00.440
when they see that
you've turned their Panda
into a monster Panda?

30:00.520 --> 30:03.360
Very happy, actually.
That's communist camouflage.

30:03.440 --> 30:05.640
I got it from a picture
of a Russian tank.

30:05.720 --> 30:08.200
This is my idea.
PA system. I always do this.

30:08.280 --> 30:09.720
-It's not a PA system.
-Well, it is.

30:09.800 --> 30:12.920
It's a bird call
and animal call system.

30:13.000 --> 30:15.200
I have an iPad,
other tablets are available,
in the car

30:15.280 --> 30:17.120
in which I can select a
number of animal noises

30:17.200 --> 30:19.560
and they play out
of those speakers.
It's a lure.

30:19.640 --> 30:21.960
Well, can we move on
to Hammond,
who's obviously gone...

30:22.040 --> 30:23.960
-If you can find it.
-...completely mad.

30:24.040 --> 30:26.360
(RICHARD CLEARS HIS THROAT)
I too have gone the
camouflage route

30:26.440 --> 30:28.760
because it's green,
as you can see.

30:28.840 --> 30:30.560
I've mended the half shaft
up here.

30:30.640 --> 30:32.320
That's the only mechanical
work I've had to do

30:32.400 --> 30:34.640
because other than that
it's been perfect.

30:34.720 --> 30:38.080
Yes, this structure here
is a hide.

30:38.160 --> 30:41.880
I know it is. It's a hide
on a monster truck.

30:41.960 --> 30:45.480
It's people that they're
scared of and they won't
see any people.

30:45.560 --> 30:47.920
Those all drop down
and in there
I've got everything I need

30:48.000 --> 30:50.520
because often you're
sitting and waiting a long
time to take pictures.

30:50.600 --> 30:53.520
We've learnt that.
I can cook, eat,
entertain myself

30:53.600 --> 30:57.400
whilst waiting to capture
an award-winning photograph
of an animal.

30:57.480 --> 31:00.120
And this rotates
through 360 degrees.

31:00.200 --> 31:02.000
-I see.
-And you, because it's you,

31:02.080 --> 31:05.040
you put two cameras in there
to film yourself.

31:05.120 --> 31:07.520
Yes, that's the most
important thing.

31:07.600 --> 31:11.160
I love the idea that you two,
I'm afraid there's no other
word, morons,

31:11.240 --> 31:13.760
have decided that somehow
you can camouflage your car

31:13.840 --> 31:16.000
so they won't be seen
by animals.

31:16.080 --> 31:20.760
I have already proved that
mine can drive right up to
a bear, he's interested.

31:20.840 --> 31:22.520
Speaking of yours,
what have you done?

31:24.040 --> 31:26.440
Whoa, what's all that
on the back?

31:26.520 --> 31:28.400
That, gentlemen,
is a scissor lift.

31:28.480 --> 31:30.040
-What?
-It's a scissor lift.

31:30.120 --> 31:33.320
Simply get in that and rise
up, so then I have a...

31:33.400 --> 31:36.080
-Oh, so you're going to be
a window cleaner.
-(LAUGHS)

31:36.160 --> 31:40.800
The only thing this didn't
really have was proper
elevation. Now I have it.

31:40.880 --> 31:43.400
-How high does it go?
-38 feet.
-(RICHARD LAUGHS)

31:43.480 --> 31:45.440
-Really?
-Yes.
-It'll just fall over.

31:45.520 --> 31:47.400
A-ha, that's why I fitted it
with outriggers.

31:47.480 --> 31:48.920
They're not far enough apart.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.600
-Or big enough.
-They slide...

31:50.680 --> 31:51.960
How much does it weigh, that?

31:52.040 --> 31:54.640
-I've added half a tonne.
-(RICHARD LAUGHS)

31:54.720 --> 31:57.120
And there's something else
I've done.

31:57.200 --> 31:59.960
Oxygen is fitted
for my engine.

32:00.040 --> 32:02.240
-Why do you need oxygen?
-Because we're going
very high.

32:02.320 --> 32:04.440
-Well, 38 feet.
-No, 15,000 feet.

32:04.520 --> 32:06.840
More, actually.
Nearly 16,000 feet.

32:06.920 --> 32:08.480
-Really?
-Why?

32:08.560 --> 32:10.520
Condors. They're in the sky.

32:10.600 --> 32:11.920
Yes, but they fly
above the ground.

32:12.000 --> 32:14.680
Yes, I know, but in order to
catch up to them,
we must go high.

32:14.760 --> 32:17.640
You can't catch up with them
and just, just photograph
them in the face.

32:17.720 --> 32:20.880
I'm telling you, you want a
condor, we've gotta go high.

32:20.960 --> 32:22.680
Oh, my God.

32:22.760 --> 32:24.640
-What?
-I've seen it as well.

32:24.720 --> 32:26.000
What, my roof?

32:26.080 --> 32:28.120
That the only piece of fabric
you could find
to make a roof?

32:28.200 --> 32:30.400
-What is that?
-It's wild life.

32:30.480 --> 32:32.320
That's for a nursery
or something, isn't it?

32:32.400 --> 32:33.560
-I mean...
-Mate!

32:33.640 --> 32:35.160
It'll keep the sun
and rain off my head.

32:35.240 --> 32:37.080
-The rain?
-Well, it'll keep
the sun off.

32:37.160 --> 32:39.560
It's a really nice
installation. That is
a quality job as well.

32:39.640 --> 32:41.440
You've really...
that is crap.

32:41.520 --> 32:43.840
So I've got oxygen
for the altitude

32:43.920 --> 32:45.720
-which we're going to.
-Yeah.

32:45.800 --> 32:48.160
-That'll stop my face
disintegrating.
-It won't.

32:48.240 --> 32:52.480
-And that means
I can photograph birds.
-It won't.

32:52.560 --> 32:56.960
JEREMY: As it was
another 200-mile drive
to reach condor country,

32:57.040 --> 33:00.680

35:47.120 --> 35:49.560
I'm starting to hear some
alarming noises from my car,

35:49.640 --> 35:52.760
-so I thought I'd share them
with you.
-(KNOCKING)

35:52.840 --> 35:56.200
There's one of them.

35:56.320 --> 35:58.360
It's almost as if the wheels
have moved on the hubs

35:58.440 --> 36:00.480
-and are starting to touch
little bits of the arches.
-(KNOCKING)

36:00.560 --> 36:03.160
Can you hear that?

36:03.200 --> 36:08.160
To try and stop the roof
flapping, I've put my monopod
here, to keep it all taut.

36:08.280 --> 36:11.200
-And that hasn't worked.
-(RATTLING)

36:11.320 --> 36:12.960
-Rattling, tyre noise.
-(FLAPPING)

36:13.040 --> 36:14.640
-Flapping.
-(REVVING)

36:14.760 --> 36:16.360
Yeah. Yeah.

36:16.440 --> 36:18.600
Bad.

36:18.640 --> 36:20.640
Still, could be worse.

36:23.320 --> 36:25.480
Oh, cock.

36:25.560 --> 36:26.800
Right, this is quite bad.

36:26.880 --> 36:28.640
What's happened
on all those windy bits,

36:28.680 --> 36:30.560
as the car leans to one side
and the other,

36:30.640 --> 36:34.000
is that the bigger tyre
has rubbed against
the filler pipe,

36:34.080 --> 36:35.920
from the cap here
down to the tank,

36:36.000 --> 36:39.160
and it's made a little hole
in it and the fuel
is gushing out,

36:39.200 --> 36:41.760
which is why I was getting
a bit stoned
as I was driving along.

36:41.840 --> 36:44.880
I thought it was just
altitude, but it was
actually petrol fumes.

36:44.960 --> 36:49.440
So what I'm gonna do is, er,
drain the tank down
by about half,

36:49.520 --> 36:51.520
so the level is below
that bit of the pipe.

36:51.600 --> 36:55.360
I will patch up that hole,
put the fuel back in

36:55.440 --> 36:57.600
and then I'll put
the proper wheels back on.

37:01.520 --> 37:04.200
JEREMY: While May did...
what he just said,

37:04.320 --> 37:07.760
Hammond and I hoovered up
some animal pictures...

37:12.600 --> 37:14.640
-Oh, yeah.
-(CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS)

37:16.520 --> 37:18.360
I got it.

37:18.440 --> 37:23.440
..in terrain that was
becoming absolutely
spectacular.

37:34.520 --> 37:38.400
It's the variety of Colombia
that staggers me most of all.

37:38.480 --> 37:40.480
One minute you're in
what looks like Japan.

37:41.920 --> 37:43.920
Then it's
the Yorkshire Dales.

37:45.000 --> 37:47.400
Then it's Austria.

37:47.480 --> 37:49.960
Then it's California.

37:50.040 --> 37:54.200
It's like the greatest hits
of the world
all in one place.

37:54.320 --> 37:56.880
I mean, Jesus,
look at that now.

38:09.640 --> 38:12.120
Eventually
we were all reunited,

38:12.160 --> 38:17.920
and, at my insistence,
we began the long climb
to 16,000 feet,

38:18.000 --> 38:19.920
where I knew
the condors would be.

38:24.040 --> 38:25.920
I cannot wait to see a condor

38:26.000 --> 38:31.280
because they are one of
the most superb creations
on Earth.

38:31.360 --> 38:34.760
They just are magnificent.

38:34.840 --> 38:39.920
They can stay
at 18,000 feet all day,
maybe flap their arms once.

38:40.000 --> 38:41.680
Once.

38:41.800 --> 38:44.920
Right, gentlemen, we're
passing 10,000 feet now.

38:45.000 --> 38:48.320
Er, how's your
temperature gauges?

38:48.400 --> 38:50.400
Mine's getting hot,
really hot.

38:52.080 --> 38:55.120
JAMES: Er, weirdly,
my car isn't overheating,

38:55.160 --> 38:57.080
but it is producing
some steam

38:57.160 --> 39:00.000
because I think maybe the cap
isn't perfectly sealed

39:00.080 --> 39:02.920
and the ambient pressure
is going down.

39:03.000 --> 39:04.040
Yeah.

39:04.120 --> 39:06.120
Why does he say
ambient pressure?

39:06.160 --> 39:08.080
Why not just pressure?

39:13.760 --> 39:15.440
JEREMY:
Soon we entered the clouds,

39:15.520 --> 39:17.400
and pulled over
to photograph

39:17.480 --> 39:20.120
something else we thought
Amazon might like.

39:22.960 --> 39:24.960
The humming bird.

39:27.800 --> 39:30.760
Sadly, though,
to attract these
wonderful little things,

39:30.840 --> 39:33.200
we had to take
drastic measures.

39:33.320 --> 39:34.640
(THRUMMING)

39:40.680 --> 39:43.040
You know when wildlife
photographers tell you

39:43.120 --> 39:44.760
-how they got the shots?
-Yeah.

39:44.840 --> 39:48.480
I bet they never ever
say, "And then we wore
scarlet lipstick."

39:48.560 --> 39:51.880
RICHARD: No.
-I've never
seen it mentioned.

39:51.960 --> 39:55.480
They also wouldn't say
that if you want the birds
to come up really close,

39:55.560 --> 39:58.680
you need to put a plastic
flower in your mouth.

40:10.800 --> 40:13.440
JAMES: Oh, that one's lovely.
Look at that, look at that.

40:22.880 --> 40:26.000
RICHARD: They are absolutely
beautiful, aren't they?

40:26.080 --> 40:27.320
Shit!

40:27.400 --> 40:29.400
I've gotta get further away.

40:32.800 --> 40:34.800
JAMES: You got it?

40:36.320 --> 40:38.160
JEREMY: Epic.

40:38.280 --> 40:41.440
I've gotta say, of all the
things we've ever done,

40:41.520 --> 40:43.080
that's kind of
up there, really.

40:43.160 --> 40:45.080
-Yeah, it's beautiful.
-I think that might be
my favourite.

40:45.160 --> 40:47.920
And now we've done
one of the world's
smallest birds,

40:48.000 --> 40:52.640
it's time to carry on going
up, and one of the biggest.

40:52.760 --> 40:54.760
-What?
-We've got to get the condor,
haven't we?

40:54.840 --> 40:57.480
-They weren't condors?
-(LAUGHTER)

41:02.760 --> 41:08.200
JAMES: We continued
on Jeremy's journey
up into the heavens.

41:08.320 --> 41:12.840
Right, we're at something
like 11 and a half thousand
feet. We're still climbing.

41:12.920 --> 41:15.560
Car is definitely
struggling now.

41:15.640 --> 41:20.600
The engine burns a mixture
of oxygen and petrol,
mainly oxygen.

41:20.640 --> 41:23.600
The oxygen is going down,
so you can't burn
as much petrol,

41:23.640 --> 41:25.480
so the engine develops
less power.

41:27.440 --> 41:30.160
I'll have to go for second.

41:30.280 --> 41:32.280
Climb, Pepe!

41:33.480 --> 41:35.760
Keeping an eye
on temperature.

41:35.840 --> 41:38.040
It is working extra hard.

41:38.120 --> 41:39.880
It might just pass
a critical level

41:39.960 --> 41:42.400
at which this car can't
suck in enough oxygen

41:42.480 --> 41:45.120
to mix with fuel to burn.

41:45.160 --> 41:49.000
And then
I'll run out of steam.

41:49.080 --> 41:54.160
The good thing
is that while my colleagues
were painting their cars,

41:54.280 --> 41:57.680
I was fitting mine
with oxygen tanks.

41:57.800 --> 41:59.480
So when I start to
really struggle,

41:59.560 --> 42:03.840
I shall simply feed pure O2
to the engine, and me.

42:07.160 --> 42:09.480
JAMES: Oh, my God.

42:09.560 --> 42:11.960
Come on.

42:12.040 --> 42:14.920
Hammond, how are things
in your monster truck?

42:15.000 --> 42:19.160
Not brilliant.
It's gone very wheezy
and it's getting very hot.

42:19.200 --> 42:22.480
We've just passed
14,000 feet now.

42:22.560 --> 42:24.560
Really running out of power.

42:26.160 --> 42:28.480
Switching to oxygen
for the engine.

42:28.560 --> 42:32.320
-(CLICKS)
-There we are, two clicks.

42:32.400 --> 42:34.640
Right, watch this.

42:34.760 --> 42:37.000
(REVVING)

42:37.080 --> 42:39.880
Kick-down is restored.

42:39.960 --> 42:41.840
That's profound,
the difference.

42:41.920 --> 42:44.560
(CACKLES)

42:44.640 --> 42:48.640
Leading
my breathless colleagues,
we continued to climb...

42:51.200 --> 42:55.000
and soon found ourselves
on a volcano.

43:02.200 --> 43:05.520
Last erupted in the 1980s

43:05.600 --> 43:08.080
and killed 25,000 people.

43:09.840 --> 43:13.880
I've never seen anywhere
with fewer animals in it.

43:13.960 --> 43:16.160
Condors live here,
I'm telling you.

43:16.280 --> 43:18.800
They come
and get volcano mice.

43:18.880 --> 43:23.160
You're destroying our cars,
you've got oxygen for you
and your car only,

43:23.280 --> 43:27.320
and we can see nothing!

43:27.400 --> 43:31.600
JEREMY: Hammond
did seem to have a point,
as no condors appeared.

43:33.600 --> 43:37.000
Nothing for it,
we've gotta go higher

43:37.080 --> 43:39.080
to find Colin Condor.

43:40.160 --> 43:42.160
Come on, hurry up, follow me.

43:45.760 --> 43:48.520
This is it,
this is all I've got.

43:48.600 --> 43:54.280
Foot is flat to the floor,
the temperature is flying up.

43:54.360 --> 43:57.120
I've just been told
we're at 15,500 feet.

43:59.720 --> 44:01.720
Oh, God,
not another steep one.

44:08.720 --> 44:10.600
Yes!

44:10.680 --> 44:14.000
JAMES: My plucky
little Panda, however,
was coping rather well.

44:15.480 --> 44:18.440
Oh, ho-ho-ho.

44:18.520 --> 44:20.920
Until it broke down.

44:21.000 --> 44:22.160
(ENGINE GIVES OUT)

44:22.240 --> 44:24.560
Bollocks!

44:24.640 --> 44:27.080
Um, I've got
a completely dead battery.

44:30.040 --> 44:33.280
Right, James, I'm gonna try
and push-start you with this.

44:33.360 --> 44:34.920
I'll be gentle.

44:35.000 --> 44:38.120
OK, please push me with
the bumper, not the wheels.

44:38.200 --> 44:40.200
I'm sure you realise that.

44:41.320 --> 44:42.400
(CLATTER)

44:42.480 --> 44:43.720
Whoa!

44:43.800 --> 44:46.160
Hammond, you've put
my window through.

44:46.240 --> 44:47.800
Oh, there is a God!

44:47.880 --> 44:51.000
I'm gonna back up to amuse
myself looking at this.

44:51.080 --> 44:52.480
JAMES: Reverse!

44:52.560 --> 44:53.840
RICHARD: Yeah, but you've
become disconnected

44:53.920 --> 44:55.520
on your back bumper
on one side.

44:58.160 --> 45:00.920
Oh, God, now mine's died
and it's boiling.

45:01.000 --> 45:03.320
JAMES:
Whoa, that's proper boiling.

45:03.400 --> 45:07.840
RICHARD: My only option
was to try and keep some air
flowing through the radiator.

45:07.920 --> 45:09.920
So I set off once more.

45:15.520 --> 45:17.520
Errr...

45:21.640 --> 45:24.560
It's swimming through ash,
that's the problem.

45:26.280 --> 45:29.160
It's now getting hotter
than ever and I don't
like this edge.

45:33.480 --> 45:35.840
(BLEEP)
That shat me up a bit.

45:43.560 --> 45:47.440
Clarkson, how
much further is it to this
"No picture opportunity"?

45:47.520 --> 45:52.160
Not much further now. Only
a couple of... Oh, a bit.

45:53.320 --> 45:55.120
He doesn't know.

45:55.200 --> 45:58.840
JEREMY: But then I saw
exactly the sort of ridge

45:58.920 --> 46:02.640
condors use to keep aloft.

46:02.720 --> 46:06.160
To reach it,
though, we'd have to
turn off the track.

46:07.480 --> 46:10.480
Now let's show those two
what the Jeep can do.

46:13.080 --> 46:15.080
There you go, there you go.

46:16.800 --> 46:18.800
(STRAINING)

46:20.360 --> 46:23.360
JAMES:
No, I can't get up there.

46:23.440 --> 46:26.160
That simply doesn't work.

46:26.240 --> 46:28.240
It's like talcum powder.

46:36.200 --> 46:38.720
No. Stuck again.

46:40.880 --> 46:42.880
Come on. Come on, Jeep.

46:44.120 --> 46:46.120
Yes, you little beauty.

46:55.520 --> 46:57.520
JEREMY: Uhh.

47:02.640 --> 47:07.000
Um, I may have overreached
myself a little bit.

47:07.080 --> 47:08.440
RICHARD:
Oh, look at all the condors.

47:08.520 --> 47:11.160
I can see they're everywhere.

47:11.240 --> 47:14.120
It doesn't work.
Let's face it.

47:15.160 --> 47:18.080
I've had a brilliant idea.

47:18.160 --> 47:22.480
Let's just get off
this dusty bit
and set our hides up there.

47:22.560 --> 47:24.280
Yes.

47:28.720 --> 47:30.720
JEREMY:
So, we drove off the dust...

47:33.840 --> 47:37.200
...found a new
likely-looking spot,

47:37.280 --> 47:39.320
and when the clouds
had lifted,

47:39.400 --> 47:43.120
we set about getting ready
to do photography.

47:47.800 --> 47:52.680
The idea of the netting
is it stops the shine
on the windows.

47:52.760 --> 47:54.960
Very visible to animals.

47:55.040 --> 47:57.040
Oh.

47:58.320 --> 48:00.320
There was some
on this side as well.

48:03.440 --> 48:06.480
-Right, it's ready.
-You're going up in it?

48:06.560 --> 48:08.240
Well, why would you not?

48:08.320 --> 48:10.240
Well, I can see one reason.

48:10.320 --> 48:11.560
You see the maximum weight?

48:11.640 --> 48:13.600
159kg.

48:13.680 --> 48:15.840
-What's...?
-Well, you're not going
anywhere, are you?

48:15.920 --> 48:19.040
-Well, the camera
is quite heavy.
-No... OK, it's the camera.

48:20.040 --> 48:22.040
(WHIRRING)

48:24.160 --> 48:26.160
Bye!

48:30.280 --> 48:33.280
This is a lot higher than
it looked in the brochure.

48:33.360 --> 48:34.960
I wouldn't like that.

48:35.040 --> 48:37.040
(LAUGHS)
That's really horrible.

48:39.480 --> 48:42.400
-Keep going
till the end bit drops out.
-(LAUGHS)

48:42.480 --> 48:44.080
-Why don't you two...
-Yes?

48:44.160 --> 48:45.520
..get in your cars.

48:45.600 --> 48:46.720
-Yes?
-OK.

48:46.800 --> 48:49.560
And can I just reinforce
one thing?

48:49.640 --> 48:52.240
RICHARD: What?
-Silence is key.

48:52.320 --> 48:54.320
JAMES: Agreed.

49:05.160 --> 49:07.280
That ridge up there
looks promising.

49:07.360 --> 49:08.760
Right.

49:08.840 --> 49:10.920
(RATCHETTING)

49:11.000 --> 49:13.040
Where is it?

49:13.120 --> 49:15.640
No, no, no, back a bit, back.

49:15.720 --> 49:19.040
I can't go back. I'll have
to go all the way round.

49:19.120 --> 49:21.000
I can hear it from up here.

49:25.080 --> 49:27.120
Right, that one there, stop.

49:27.200 --> 49:29.200
Got it.

49:33.960 --> 49:35.960
RICHARD:
Think I'll make a coffee.
-(CLATTERING)

49:37.560 --> 49:39.240
Sorry.

49:39.320 --> 49:42.800
JEREMY: Then it was May's
turn to disturb the peace.

49:42.880 --> 49:44.880
(DUCK-LIKE
AMPLIFIED BIRD CRIES)

49:46.560 --> 49:47.840
JEREMY: What is that?

49:47.920 --> 49:49.520
It's a bird call.

49:49.600 --> 49:53.040
It's a duck!

49:53.120 --> 49:56.720
JEREMY: Moments later,
though, there was
an even worse noise.

49:57.840 --> 49:59.360
-(THUNDER)
RICHARD: Oh, God.

49:59.440 --> 50:00.920
JEREMY: Jesus!

50:01.000 --> 50:02.600
RICHARD: If only there was
something tall and metal

50:02.680 --> 50:04.280
that would attract
the lightning.

50:06.160 --> 50:10.560
JEREMY: Not wishing to be
fried, I quickly descended.

50:10.640 --> 50:13.600
And then we all tried to
outrun the storm...

50:16.240 --> 50:18.200
which didn't work.

50:18.280 --> 50:20.280
(THUNDER)

50:24.400 --> 50:27.240
JEREMY: Jesus Christ!

50:27.320 --> 50:30.480
We're 250 miles
from the equator,

50:30.560 --> 50:33.120
we're on a volcano
in a severe hailstorm.

50:38.120 --> 50:41.080
How much hail is there
in the sky?

50:41.160 --> 50:43.160
There's hail coming in now.

50:45.800 --> 50:48.880
It's bouncing in
through the back.

50:48.960 --> 50:50.960
RICHARD: Still, we got some
great condor photographs.

50:52.760 --> 50:55.360
Oh... (BLEEP)
...look at this now.

50:55.440 --> 50:58.040
JEREMY:
Life in the Jeep was hideous.

50:58.120 --> 51:00.120
Oh, God.

51:01.240 --> 51:04.320
Ah, ah... (BLEEP)

51:04.400 --> 51:07.560
Ice right down
the back of my neck.

51:07.640 --> 51:09.600
Oh... (BLEEP)

51:09.680 --> 51:11.840
I've just put all the ice
down the back of my seat.

51:11.920 --> 51:13.440
Oh, bollocks!

51:13.520 --> 51:15.840
Richard was very sympathetic.

51:15.920 --> 51:18.080
Oh, dear.

51:18.160 --> 51:20.160
Oh, that is a lot of snow.

51:21.720 --> 51:23.400
(LAUGHS)

51:23.480 --> 51:27.480
Oh, joy. Joyous moment.

51:29.920 --> 51:32.400
JEREMY: Mercifully, though,
the storm passed,

51:32.480 --> 51:38.400
so we drove down the rough
and icy mountain track,
long into the night.

51:42.240 --> 51:43.640
(BELL RINGS)

51:43.720 --> 51:46.080
And the next morning
woke for a rethink

51:46.160 --> 51:49.640
in a makeshift
camp on the edge of a town.

51:57.200 --> 51:59.800
(GROANS)

52:04.360 --> 52:06.360
(CAMERA SHUTTER)

52:07.880 --> 52:09.240
What are you doing?

52:09.320 --> 52:11.440
I told you condors
live down here.

52:11.520 --> 52:14.880
Living?
It was living up there
and it's had engine failure,

52:14.960 --> 52:16.360
and it's crashed here.

52:16.440 --> 52:18.160
Doesn't matter how
it got here. Fact is, it is

52:18.240 --> 52:20.760
and I've got the pictures of
it. That means we're done.

52:20.840 --> 52:22.640
-You can't put that...
-(CAMERA SHUTTER)

52:22.720 --> 52:25.360
...on an Amazon screen saver.

52:25.440 --> 52:26.720
Why not?

52:26.800 --> 52:30.040
-Well...
-(CREAKING AND THUD)

52:30.120 --> 52:32.200
It's lost quite a lot
of its majesty.

52:32.280 --> 52:35.480
But it's a condor, and that
means we're finished,
that's it. We're done.

52:35.560 --> 52:37.640
James,
I've got a condor shot.

52:37.720 --> 52:39.040
Have you?
Have you done it?

52:39.120 --> 52:41.520
That is the final one.
It's a condor, in camera,

52:41.600 --> 52:43.840
finished, out of here.

52:45.840 --> 52:47.240
JEREMY:
Hammond was wrong, though.

52:47.320 --> 52:50.200
We still had
one more animal to find.

52:50.280 --> 52:52.280
The one that didn't
make any sense.

52:53.320 --> 52:55.560
The hippopotamus.

52:55.640 --> 53:00.120
Right, listen, this is
obviously some kind of town.

53:00.200 --> 53:03.040
I am a journalist,
and a bloody good one.

53:04.360 --> 53:06.200
So why don't I pop into town

53:06.280 --> 53:09.560
and see if I can find out
anything about this
hippopotamus story?

53:11.720 --> 53:13.720
(BARKING)

53:21.720 --> 53:25.160
RICHARD:
My hide did not do well
on that drive last night.

53:29.520 --> 53:32.280
JEREMY: No, I can see that,
and neither did my camera.

53:32.360 --> 53:36.680
No, it's, um, fogged up, I
think, is the technical term.

53:36.760 --> 53:39.960
JAMES: My car actually
fell over in the night.

53:40.040 --> 53:42.200
I know nothing about it.

53:42.280 --> 53:45.680
JEREMY: Once we'd parked,
I set about doing journalism.

53:45.760 --> 53:47.640
(BARKING)

53:47.720 --> 53:49.840
This is like being back on
the Rotherham Advertiser.

53:49.920 --> 53:51.920
Except this is nothing
like Rotherham.

53:54.000 --> 53:56.240
-Buenos dias.
MAN: Buenos dias.

53:56.320 --> 53:58.320
Hippopotamus.

54:00.320 --> 54:01.640
Hippopotami?

54:01.720 --> 54:03.760
Gracias.

54:03.840 --> 54:06.320
Nobody knows, nobody knows.

54:06.400 --> 54:08.480
Having drawn
a journalistic blank...

54:08.560 --> 54:09.800
Excuse me.

54:09.880 --> 54:12.280
..I decided
to do art instead.

54:17.280 --> 54:18.640
Hippopotamus.

54:18.720 --> 54:21.280
-What?
-Hippopotamus.

54:21.360 --> 54:25.080
Yes. Where?

54:25.160 --> 54:27.320
(SPEAKS SPANISH)

54:27.400 --> 54:29.880
What's that? Got a
Spanish-speaking cameraman,
where is he?

54:29.960 --> 54:31.280
What's that mean?

54:31.360 --> 54:33.360
(EXCHANGE IN SPANISH)

54:36.120 --> 54:37.640
CAMERAMAN: They are here.

54:37.720 --> 54:40.080
-They are here?
-(REPLIES)

54:40.160 --> 54:42.400
-Where are they?
-(CAMERAMAN TRANSLATES)

54:42.480 --> 54:46.800
(EXCHANGE IN SPANISH)

54:46.880 --> 54:51.600
JEREMY:
Having got the information,
I went back to my colleagues.

54:52.600 --> 54:54.040
Any joy?

54:54.120 --> 54:55.560
More than.

54:55.640 --> 55:00.040
I have heard the most
astonishing story.

55:00.120 --> 55:03.000
Apparently there was
this guy in Colombia

55:03.080 --> 55:07.120
who had a business
exporting forest products
all around the world, OK?

55:07.200 --> 55:09.440
Really, really successful.
So successful,

55:09.520 --> 55:12.560
he bought himself
some pet hippopotamuses.

55:12.640 --> 55:15.280
-Who was he?
-Pablo someone or other.

55:15.360 --> 55:17.160
Anyway, the police shot him.

55:17.240 --> 55:19.880
-Why?
-I don't know.

55:19.960 --> 55:23.200
They shot him
and after he was dead,
his hippopotamuses escaped.

55:23.280 --> 55:26.680
Yeah?
And they've been living
in the wild and breeding.

55:26.760 --> 55:29.720
So there are hippopotamuses
here and they are wild

55:29.800 --> 55:31.600
and I know where they are

55:31.680 --> 55:34.600
and they're only 120km away.

55:34.680 --> 55:36.880
-Well, we're in.
-Let's do it.

55:36.960 --> 55:38.560
-Finish your coffees.
JAMES: That's excellent.

55:38.640 --> 55:40.080
RICHARD:
That is staggering news.

55:40.160 --> 55:41.840
The only thing is,
for this 120km,

55:41.920 --> 55:44.560
would either of you mind
if I modified my car?

55:44.640 --> 55:46.480
By unmodifying it.

55:52.320 --> 55:54.600
JEREMY: Having all
unmodified our cars,

55:54.680 --> 55:56.880
I decided
that before moving out,

55:56.960 --> 55:59.880
there was a small job to do.

55:59.960 --> 56:04.720
Right, I've borrowed
something from Hammond
to annoy May. (CLICKS TONGUE)

56:14.760 --> 56:16.760
â™ª LOS YETIS: Soy Un Hombre

56:27.200 --> 56:31.520
Seeing that little
New Labour Fiat Panda
with its Brexit sticker on.

56:31.600 --> 56:34.560
(LAUGHS)

56:34.640 --> 56:39.760
That is like putting an
I-heart-Mexico sticker on the
back of Donald Trump's Beast.

56:39.840 --> 56:41.840
I mean, his car, not...

56:45.040 --> 56:50.680
JEREMY: We were now
on the last 75 miles
of our 1300-mile trek

56:50.760 --> 56:56.160
through what had turned out
to be one of the world's
most incredible countries.

56:58.400 --> 57:03.320
If you were to combine Canada
and Russia and Australia,

57:03.400 --> 57:05.680
you still wouldn't have
the variety,

57:05.760 --> 57:09.040
in terms of terrain and
temperature and wildlife,

57:09.120 --> 57:11.960
that we've seen on this...

57:12.040 --> 57:15.040
absolutely epic journey.

57:46.160 --> 57:50.160
But of course,
we wouldn't have been
able to see any of that

57:50.240 --> 57:52.080
without our cars.

57:52.160 --> 57:54.160
â™ª LOS DUG DUG'S: Felicidad

58:05.440 --> 58:10.000
Let me just remind you
that this is a small,
49 horsepower,

58:10.080 --> 58:13.640
one-litre utility hatchback.

58:13.720 --> 58:16.480
It is a humble car.

58:16.560 --> 58:20.040
And yet that humility
is actually its strength.

58:20.120 --> 58:23.160
Because it's done everything
the other two cars have done.

58:23.240 --> 58:26.920
It's climbed the same
mountains, it's driven along
the same rutted tracks,

58:27.000 --> 58:29.880
it's forded
the same small rivers.

58:29.960 --> 58:32.080
It's absolutely brilliant.
I love it.

58:37.000 --> 58:39.360
On this trip, the camera
and production teams

58:39.440 --> 58:43.880
have lost six almost new
Toyota Land Cruisers.

58:45.400 --> 58:48.520
Hammond has lost
a half shaft.

58:48.600 --> 58:52.280
May's lost
most of his electrics
and a starter motor.

58:54.040 --> 58:56.000
But this... nothing.

58:56.080 --> 58:59.360
Nothing has gone wrong.

58:59.440 --> 59:02.240
It's taken everything that
Colombia could throw at it.

59:02.320 --> 59:04.920
Temperature extremes,
altitude extremes,

59:05.000 --> 59:06.440
roads like
you wouldn't believe

59:06.520 --> 59:09.000
and it's just gone,
"Yeah? What?"

59:10.960 --> 59:12.960
Yes, it's desperately
uncomfortable

59:13.040 --> 59:14.600
and if you hit
a pothole hard enough,

59:14.680 --> 59:18.080
it would put your spine
through the top
of your skull.

59:18.160 --> 59:20.920
But, and this is
more important,

59:21.000 --> 59:25.440
I liked it when we got here
and I like it even more now.

59:28.080 --> 59:30.080
It has a sturdy heart.

59:36.840 --> 59:41.160
I do realise
that James Bond doesn't
drive a monster truck.

59:41.240 --> 59:44.400
Nobody in a suit, in fact,
has ever driven
a monster truck.

59:44.480 --> 59:47.240
They're not... cool.

59:47.320 --> 59:52.200
You could argue,
as the other two have, that
they're moronic and stupid.

59:52.280 --> 59:55.000
Or you could argue
that they're fun...

59:55.080 --> 59:58.520
Cos that's what they are.
They're built
to make you smile.

59:58.600 --> 1:00:01.760
And what amazes me
is that even with the
modifications done to it,

1:00:01.840 --> 1:00:03.200
all of which
have made it worse...

1:00:03.280 --> 1:00:07.600
It's too tall, too wide,
too slow. It overheats.

1:00:07.680 --> 1:00:10.280
...still it's done everything
the other two cars have done,

1:00:10.360 --> 1:00:12.360
which makes it the best,

1:00:12.440 --> 1:00:14.440
easily, in my opinion.

1:00:15.480 --> 1:00:17.960
Oh, my car's gone again.

1:00:18.040 --> 1:00:20.000
My car has just died again.

1:00:20.080 --> 1:00:22.920
I'm pulling over.

1:00:23.000 --> 1:00:26.720
JEREMY: Had you just done
a piece to camera saying
what a great truck it was?

1:00:26.800 --> 1:00:28.800
RICHARD: I may have done.

1:00:31.280 --> 1:00:32.360
Yeah.

1:00:34.560 --> 1:00:37.720
JEREMY: Eventually the Trump
truck was back in business.

1:00:40.400 --> 1:00:44.080
And soon we were close
to our final destination.

1:00:48.600 --> 1:00:52.640
Right, this apparently
is the area where
the businessman lived.

1:00:52.720 --> 1:00:55.160
And if you go down
his escape road here...

1:00:55.240 --> 1:00:56.920
-His what?
-Escape road.

1:00:57.000 --> 1:00:59.760
He built it
in case the police came.

1:00:59.840 --> 1:01:01.200
And so he could get away.

1:01:01.280 --> 1:01:03.120
-It wasn't very good, then.
-No, it wasn't.

1:01:03.200 --> 1:01:07.760
Anyway, if you go down it,
there's a pool where
the hippos are now living.

1:01:08.760 --> 1:01:10.280
Target acquired.
Let's do it.

1:01:10.360 --> 1:01:12.040
JAMES: Let's do that.
-Hippos!

1:01:17.800 --> 1:01:20.120
So, a quick dash
down the escape route...

1:01:21.520 --> 1:01:24.160
to the water,
grab a shot of a hippo.

1:01:28.840 --> 1:01:30.880
Yes, viewers,
about a kilometre to go

1:01:30.960 --> 1:01:34.080
and I haven't been run over
by a monster truck.

1:01:34.160 --> 1:01:35.600
(REVVING)

1:01:35.680 --> 1:01:37.680
I'm absolutely delighted.

1:01:39.240 --> 1:01:40.800
Hammond,
I can only see you behind me.

1:01:40.880 --> 1:01:42.880
Can you see Clarkson
behind you?

1:01:44.080 --> 1:01:46.760
No. Just looking for him.

1:01:46.840 --> 1:01:51.640
RICHARD: At that moment,
though, we were distracted by
what lay in front of us.

1:01:56.680 --> 1:01:58.840
That is a pond!

1:01:58.920 --> 1:02:01.080
That's a pond.

1:02:01.160 --> 1:02:03.160
JAMES: Yes.

1:02:05.480 --> 1:02:07.160
-We're in with a shout here.
-What?

1:02:07.240 --> 1:02:09.200
Well, that looks like a hippo
sort of pond, doesn't it?

1:02:09.280 --> 1:02:11.560
Who put that..
Did you put that on my car?

1:02:11.640 --> 1:02:13.680
-What?
-That sticker?

1:02:13.760 --> 1:02:15.360
No, I thought you did
when you did your mods.

1:02:15.440 --> 1:02:17.560
-Don't be ridiculous.
-Well, I was surprised.

1:02:17.640 --> 1:02:19.280
It's a strong statement
for you but...

1:02:19.360 --> 1:02:21.320
You did that at that
fuel stop, didn't you?

1:02:21.400 --> 1:02:23.800
-No, it's been there since
your mods went on, mate.
-No, it hasn't.

1:02:23.880 --> 1:02:27.280
You shout it loud and proud.
I wouldn't let
your friends see it.

1:02:27.360 --> 1:02:29.600
Anyway, important business
to be done.

1:02:31.360 --> 1:02:32.800
RICHARD:
Rather than wait for Jeremy,

1:02:32.880 --> 1:02:34.240
we decided to be ready

1:02:34.320 --> 1:02:36.880
in case our
final target appeared.

He-he-he.

1:03:14.040 --> 1:03:16.880
Martha Hussein,
you are in my sights.

1:03:24.040 --> 1:03:26.040
Look at his big fat face.

1:03:35.120 --> 1:03:37.120
JAMES: Yes!

1:03:38.720 --> 1:03:41.520
-Well, that's it.
-That's tremendous.

1:03:41.600 --> 1:03:43.080
(CHUCKLING)

1:03:43.160 --> 1:03:45.640
Hippopotamus!

1:03:47.400 --> 1:03:49.880
-Congratulations.
-Well done, us.

1:03:49.960 --> 1:03:53.040
I say we've done it.
We've done it. Where's...

1:03:53.120 --> 1:03:54.840
I know, I've been
worrying about that.

1:03:54.920 --> 1:03:56.440
Well, if it gets here,

1:03:56.520 --> 1:03:58.080
you realise that'll be
the first time

1:03:58.160 --> 1:03:59.600
any car
on any of these trips

1:03:59.680 --> 1:04:02.040
has ever got to the end
without a single fault.

1:04:02.120 --> 1:04:03.560
Nothing's gone wrong with it.

1:04:03.640 --> 1:04:05.280
That's about the only time
that's ever happened.

1:04:05.360 --> 1:04:07.640
-The car, get to the end,
it hasn't broken at all.
-You're right.

1:04:07.720 --> 1:04:09.720
That's a record.

1:04:11.520 --> 1:04:13.800
You don't think he fell off
that little scary bridgy bit?

1:04:13.880 --> 1:04:15.880
I don't know.

1:04:15.960 --> 1:04:18.680
He overcooked it
because it's near the end.
And tried to do some...

1:04:18.760 --> 1:04:21.040
-Hang on a minute,
is that...?
-It is.

1:04:21.120 --> 1:04:26.320
Oh, brief moment of
elation followed by
plummeting depression.

1:04:26.400 --> 1:04:28.120
(JAMES LAUGHS)

1:04:29.800 --> 1:04:31.640
-Where have you been?
-Welcome.

1:04:31.720 --> 1:04:33.560
I've been mending my camera.

1:04:33.640 --> 1:04:35.520
-You don't need it.
-What?

1:04:35.600 --> 1:04:37.880
We've done it, mate.
We've got shots of a hippo.
It is done.

1:04:37.960 --> 1:04:40.120
-We've finished.
We've done it.
-Behold the hippo.

1:04:40.200 --> 1:04:41.640
We got shots
of a hippo just then.

1:04:41.720 --> 1:04:43.360
Came out
a couple of minutes ago.

1:04:43.440 --> 1:04:45.360
-So that's the end?
-That is the end.
-Job done.

1:04:45.440 --> 1:04:48.600
And we've got through the
whole programme without
once mentioning cocaine.

1:04:48.680 --> 1:04:50.480
Oh.

1:04:50.560 --> 1:04:53.080
James, we said
before we came out here,

1:04:53.160 --> 1:04:54.720
we weren't going to use
the c-word.

1:04:54.800 --> 1:04:57.000
We were going to be
the first people ever

1:04:57.080 --> 1:04:59.680
to go to Colombia
and not talk that.

1:04:59.760 --> 1:05:00.840
Sorry.

1:05:00.920 --> 1:05:03.440
It just slipped out.

1:05:03.520 --> 1:05:05.240
And on that terrible
disappointment,
it's time to end.

1:05:05.320 --> 1:05:07.920
We hope you enjoy looking at
the photographs we've taken.

1:05:08.000 --> 1:05:10.400
-They won't.
-Well, some of them
are quite good.

1:05:10.480 --> 1:05:12.360
-Well, one or two of them
are good.
-No.

1:05:12.440 --> 1:05:14.800
Well, whatever.
We'll see you very soon.

1:05:14.880 --> 1:05:16.120
Goodbye.
