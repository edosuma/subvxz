♪♪

00:05.373 --> 00:07.039
( deeply inhales )

00:07.975 --> 00:09.308
Oh!
( coughs )

00:09.310 --> 00:10.743
That's dirty.

00:11.846 --> 00:13.712
( sniffs, coughs )

00:14.782 --> 00:15.914
I can wear that
one more day.

00:17.518 --> 00:19.184
-Maddie.
-Hey, liv.

00:19.186 --> 00:21.020
Okay, so...

00:21.022 --> 00:23.122
You know how I'm receiving
the porcupine of the year award
at school?

00:23.124 --> 00:26.625
Yeah, you're up-cycling club
raised so much money
for charity.

00:26.627 --> 00:28.460
-I'm so proud of you, liv.
-Thank you.

00:28.462 --> 00:31.363
Well, guess who's presenting
the award to me.

00:31.365 --> 00:34.700
Hmm, channel four meteorologist
johnny nimbus.

00:35.636 --> 00:36.902
Grandma janice.

00:36.904 --> 00:40.172
What? No!
Grandma janice is coming?

00:40.174 --> 00:43.308
Grandma janice
is the coolest woman I know.

00:43.310 --> 00:47.246
Get this.
She was an olympic diver.

00:47.248 --> 00:50.182
Ugh! I named my first
basketball after her.

00:50.184 --> 00:51.383
( chuckles )

00:52.319 --> 00:55.754
Hey, janice.
What's up, girl?
( laughs )

00:55.756 --> 00:59.391
Now grandma's a globe-trotting
wildlife photographer.

00:59.393 --> 01:02.161
Ha! Pretty much
every single rhino photo

01:02.163 --> 01:04.263
That you've probably ever seen
has been taken by her,

01:04.265 --> 01:07.366
Except for, you know,
those extreme close-ups

01:07.368 --> 01:09.168
'cause those people
didn't make it.
( hisses )

01:10.571 --> 01:13.072
The girls have always had
a special bond with my mom

01:13.074 --> 01:14.840
Because she's also
an identical twin.

01:17.445 --> 01:20.779
I, on the other hand,
had to go out in the world
and make friends.

01:20.781 --> 01:23.082
Wow, wow.

01:23.084 --> 01:24.850
That is just so nice of her.

01:24.852 --> 01:27.519
You know, I mean,
especially considering
that I'm...

01:29.123 --> 01:30.923
I mean...
( stutters ) you know.

01:31.859 --> 01:34.093
Um, no, I don't know, maddie.

01:34.095 --> 01:36.628
-Why don't you tell me?
-All right, fine.

01:36.630 --> 01:40.232
I mean, I guess
especially considering that
I've always been her favorite.

01:40.234 --> 01:43.068
( laughs ) hey.
Okay.

01:43.070 --> 01:46.271
Just because
you are both athletic-y,

01:46.273 --> 01:49.241
And adventurous,
and you both wear glasses

01:49.243 --> 01:50.809
Does not automatically mean--

01:50.810 --> 01:52.376
Okay,
so it automatically means
that you're her favorite.

01:53.314 --> 01:56.648
But I'm johnny nimbus's
favorite... ( laughs ) so...

01:59.386 --> 02:01.553
-Oh, wait, liv!
-Yeah.

02:01.555 --> 02:03.255
Smell this.
Can I wear this
one more day?

he's near!

03:03.551 --> 03:04.616
Oh.

03:05.553 --> 03:07.886
I'm always closer
than you think, joseph.

03:09.356 --> 03:11.256
-So perhaps too close.
-Pretty close.

03:12.693 --> 03:13.992
Yo, man,
if this is about watching

03:13.994 --> 03:18.564
The mcgilroy-mimen jk113 comet
with my sweet telescope,

03:18.566 --> 03:21.567
Wish upon another star.

03:21.569 --> 03:26.705
The mcgilroy-mimen jk113 comet
is called the lovers' comet.

03:26.707 --> 03:29.541
They say whomever you're with
when it reaches its apex

03:29.543 --> 03:31.677
Is destined to be
your true love.

03:31.679 --> 03:34.479
Last time it came around
I was seven

03:34.481 --> 03:36.415
And eating fruit peelers.

03:38.485 --> 03:40.786
You still got it, baby.

03:41.722 --> 03:44.590
Joseph, we'd be fools
not to capitalize on this comet

03:44.592 --> 03:46.858
By throwing a party
and packing it with women,

03:46.860 --> 03:48.927
So we can meet our soul mates.

03:49.863 --> 03:52.698
So why would I want
to throw a party with you?

03:52.700 --> 03:56.134
Hmm, how do I
put this tactfully?

03:57.271 --> 03:58.870
( sighs )
when it comes to women,

03:58.872 --> 04:00.839
The two of us fish
from the same stream.

04:01.842 --> 04:03.909
This lovers' comet
is a chance for us

04:03.911 --> 04:06.511
To plunge our hands in the water
like powerful grizzly bears

04:06.513 --> 04:08.647
And pull out
the salmon of our dreams.

04:10.517 --> 04:12.384
Not gonna lie,
I've lost the metaphor.

04:12.386 --> 04:14.052
The girls are the salmon.
We're the bears.

04:14.054 --> 04:15.420
The stream is your backyard.

04:16.357 --> 04:17.689
Just say it that way
next time.

04:22.296 --> 04:25.297
Oh, I cannot wait
to see grandma janice.

04:25.299 --> 04:27.432
I love her so much.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.701
I love that
every time I see her,

04:29.703 --> 04:31.370
She gives me 20 bucks.

04:31.372 --> 04:35.741
What?
Grandma knows the going rate
for adorableness.

04:35.743 --> 04:37.576
( gasps )
she's here!
She's here!

04:37.578 --> 04:39.411
Quick, everyone put on
one of grandma's

04:39.413 --> 04:41.213
Hideous crocheted gifts!

04:43.150 --> 04:45.150
Grandma travels a lot,

04:45.152 --> 04:47.252
Which means a lot
of long plane rides.

04:47.254 --> 04:50.555
And to pass the time
she crochets badly,

04:50.557 --> 04:52.791
Very badly.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.861
Actually, I don't know,
this could be great crochet.

04:56.797 --> 04:59.131
Three continents, two trains,
four airplanes

04:59.133 --> 05:02.167
-And over 8,000 miles...
-We bring you

05:02.169 --> 05:04.536
One amazing grandma!

05:10.010 --> 05:12.010
You forgot the elephant ride.

05:12.946 --> 05:14.513
Here comes the huggin' fest.

05:15.449 --> 05:18.650
-Grandma!
-Liv!

05:20.587 --> 05:22.521
-Hi!
-( laughs )

05:23.590 --> 05:26.191
Thank you so much
for coming to present my award.

05:26.193 --> 05:28.794
Are you kidding?
I just had to be here

05:28.796 --> 05:31.897
-For my granddaughter.
-( maddie coughs )

05:33.000 --> 05:34.499
Oh, hi, maddie.

05:35.469 --> 05:40.605
Joey, you got so tall
and handsome.

05:40.607 --> 05:41.640
You have a girlfriend yet?

05:41.642 --> 05:43.975
Oh, well,
as fate would have it,

05:43.977 --> 05:46.311
-There's a comet passing--
-I got my answer.

05:46.313 --> 05:47.346
Okay.

05:47.348 --> 05:49.314
Make way, people.

05:49.316 --> 05:51.483
Adorable baby of the family
coming through.

05:51.485 --> 05:54.720
Parker, you got tall too,

05:54.722 --> 05:58.523
But you'll always be grandma's
little mini-muffin.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.926
( sighs )
can you stand it?

06:03.163 --> 06:06.231
I see you got the dress
I crocheted for you.

06:06.233 --> 06:07.632
Yeah, I love it.

06:07.634 --> 06:10.535
-It fits to a tee.
-Liv: Thank you.

06:10.537 --> 06:14.172
No 20 bucks?
What's going on?!

06:14.174 --> 06:17.576
( gasps )
have I aged out
of my cuteness?

06:17.578 --> 06:22.514
Guys, is it just me
or is grandma acting,
like, a little strange?

06:22.516 --> 06:26.318
Oh, ho ho, is someone
not grandma's favorite anymore?

06:26.320 --> 06:28.954
-( scoffs )
-it's cold over here
in the shadows, isn't it?

06:30.491 --> 06:31.590
Scarf? Here.

06:38.065 --> 06:40.265
Thanks for letting me have
my comet party tomorrow, mom.

06:40.267 --> 06:42.033
"you sure you wouldn't want
to come to the ceremony

06:42.035 --> 06:44.069
Honoring your sister,"
she said pointedly,

06:44.071 --> 06:46.071
-Hoping for the right answer.
-( chuckles )

06:46.073 --> 06:48.240
"no," he said honestly,

06:48.242 --> 06:50.175
Having gotten used to
his mother's disapproving stare.

06:53.847 --> 06:56.281
All right,
the table is all set.

06:56.283 --> 06:58.083
Now, where's grandma?

06:58.085 --> 06:59.885
I really want to play
our traditional game of horse.

06:59.887 --> 07:01.119
( chuckles )
I love her,

07:01.121 --> 07:02.821
But I am taking
that tiny lady down.

07:05.025 --> 07:07.058
She's at the mall with liv,
shopping for an outfit

07:07.060 --> 07:09.795
For the "porcupine
of the year" award ceremony.

07:09.797 --> 07:11.930
-Seriously?
-Mm-hmm.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.799
Grandma hates shopping.

07:15.636 --> 07:18.970
Is it just me
or does grandma janice
seem kind of like

07:18.972 --> 07:21.039
Not grandma janice
to you?

07:21.041 --> 07:22.925
What do you mean, maddie?

07:22.926 --> 07:24.810
Well, I don't know.
It's just usually
when she shows up,

07:24.812 --> 07:27.612
I'm her--
I don't want to go ahead
and just say "favorite,"

07:27.614 --> 07:29.281
But, I mean,
no, let's be honest.
I'm her favorite.

07:30.984 --> 07:34.219
And she just-- she seems like
a completely different person.

07:34.221 --> 07:35.253
Oh.

07:35.255 --> 07:37.022
( gasps )

07:38.959 --> 07:41.193
What if she's
a completely different person?

07:42.129 --> 07:43.962
Yeah, no,
what if grandma

07:43.964 --> 07:47.165
And great aunt hilary
pulled a switcheroo?

07:48.135 --> 07:50.902
Okay, maddie, honey.

07:50.904 --> 07:53.939
I know it's weird
that liv is getting the majority
of the attention this trip,

07:53.941 --> 07:56.374
But you sound a little
crazy-pants right now.

07:57.811 --> 07:59.211
( gasps )
you're in on it.

08:01.014 --> 08:03.515
You want me to think
that I'm crazy-pants,

08:03.517 --> 08:06.084
But really I'm righty-pants
and you're wrongy-pants!

08:08.989 --> 08:11.890
Okay, so I sound
a little bit crazy-pants.

08:13.594 --> 08:18.997
All right, I'm going for
maximum-grandson adorableness.

08:18.999 --> 08:22.834
Are bunny slippers
with the duckie pajamas
too much?

08:24.671 --> 08:27.038
You're right.
Go big or go home.

08:34.448 --> 08:38.850
So what girls should we invite
to the party of the century?

08:38.852 --> 08:40.118
Whoa, wow.
What about her?

08:40.120 --> 08:41.853
Two-handed reader.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.522
I'm guessing
she doesn't have plans.

08:43.524 --> 08:46.691
That's alex.
She's in my robotics class.

08:46.693 --> 08:49.861
We have a bit
of a flirtationship.

08:49.863 --> 08:51.730
( laughs )
lock it down, son.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.700
( nervous chuckle )
hey, alex.

08:55.702 --> 08:58.003
I was wondering if you, uh,
wanted to come as my date

08:58.005 --> 09:00.138
To my comet party tonight?

09:01.742 --> 09:02.874
That doesn't sound unpleasant.

09:02.876 --> 09:04.209
( squeaks )

09:04.211 --> 09:06.011
I can come by after
my social interaction class.

09:06.013 --> 09:07.646
I will now tap you
on the shoulder

09:07.648 --> 09:09.414
To show connection
and acknowledge your kind offer.

09:10.384 --> 09:11.616
Yay.

09:13.387 --> 09:15.854
( laughs )
oh, hell yeah!

09:15.856 --> 09:17.222
This is the perfect plan!

09:17.224 --> 09:18.757
Now go get another.

09:18.759 --> 09:20.992
What? No, dude.
I just got a date.

09:20.994 --> 09:24.663
One date? Come on,
this is  <i> you,  </i> joey.

09:24.665 --> 09:27.098
I mean, how do you even know
if she's gonna show up?

09:27.100 --> 09:28.533
You need to get
as many as you can

09:28.535 --> 09:31.202
And let the comet
decide your love.

09:31.204 --> 09:33.004
Ooh, uh, what about her?

09:33.006 --> 09:36.074
I don't know her name,
but I know she drinks
two chocolate milks at lunch.

09:36.076 --> 09:39.711
That is samantha.
She's in the drama club.

09:39.713 --> 09:41.413
She's, like,
super into shakespeare.

09:41.415 --> 09:43.548
Well, go get her
super into you.

09:43.550 --> 09:44.749
( snaps )

09:46.553 --> 09:48.620
( coughs nervously )

09:48.622 --> 09:51.089
-Milady.
-Oh, good sir.

09:51.091 --> 09:53.258
Wouldeth thou care
to accompany me

09:53.260 --> 09:55.093
To a celestial event
at  <i> casa  </i> rooney

09:55.095 --> 09:57.779
Come evening tide?

09:57.780 --> 10:00.464
Oh, and be at thy side
as the heavens swoon
and decide our fates?

10:00.467 --> 10:04.202
Grantest thee this boon
I shall, kind sir.

10:05.405 --> 10:07.172
-Is that a yes?
-Oh.

10:08.709 --> 10:10.075
-Yeah.
-( dramatic laugh )

10:10.077 --> 10:11.476
( giggles )

10:11.478 --> 10:12.777
( giggles )

10:12.779 --> 10:15.547
( chuckles )
brother, they should
call you "butter,"

10:15.549 --> 10:17.082
Because you are on a roll!

10:17.084 --> 10:19.017
Both:
Holla!

10:20.153 --> 10:22.220
( deep robotic voice )
I hear you're having
a party tonight.

10:22.222 --> 10:23.788
( both shriek )

10:23.790 --> 10:26.224
Sorry, um...

10:26.226 --> 10:27.993
( normal voice )
I hear you're having
a party tonight.

10:29.162 --> 10:31.196
She's heard.
We have party buzz.

10:33.100 --> 10:36.735
Yeah, I was hoping
you could come as my date.

10:36.737 --> 10:39.270
Great, I'll see you there.

10:39.272 --> 10:41.606
I'll make sure I get there
before the apex.

10:41.608 --> 10:42.807
Could you...

10:42.809 --> 10:45.310
( deep robotic voice )
before the apex.

10:45.312 --> 10:47.145
( both giggle )

10:49.282 --> 10:52.183
Dude, I have three dates
for my party.

10:52.185 --> 10:55.186
So far.
To the band room.

10:55.188 --> 10:57.322
The clarinet section
is ripe for the picking.

10:57.324 --> 10:59.257
( laughing, mimics clarinets )

11:02.362 --> 11:04.329
Wow, maddie.

11:04.331 --> 11:08.533
A tea party.
Looks like royalty's
paying a visit.

11:09.703 --> 11:13.438
Yes, well, there really is
only one grandma janice,

11:13.440 --> 11:14.606
So...
( chuckles )

11:14.608 --> 11:16.174
Unless there are two!

11:16.176 --> 11:18.176
Yeah, see, the more
I thought about it,

11:18.178 --> 11:21.212
The more I realized
that I was not crazy-pants.

11:21.214 --> 11:23.014
Yeah. I am grandma's favorite.

11:23.016 --> 11:26.284
And that woman
was not giving me a whiff
of the favorite vibe.

11:26.286 --> 11:29.788
That was not my grandmother.
That was my great-aunt hilary,

11:29.790 --> 11:31.122
And I was gonna prove it.

11:32.059 --> 11:34.025
What's under
the fancy serving dome?

11:34.027 --> 11:35.193
Well, I'm glad you asked.

11:35.195 --> 11:38.129
Ha ha, I have a little
bit of a surprise.

11:38.131 --> 11:40.198
Um, last time
grandma came to visit

11:40.200 --> 11:43.201
<i>She and I went out for tea,</i>
<i>you know, just the two of us.</i>

11:43.203 --> 11:45.003
And we shared something
really special

11:45.005 --> 11:47.739
That, uh, really only
she would know what that is.

11:47.741 --> 11:50.809
So, um, what might that be,
grandma?

11:50.811 --> 11:54.979
Oh, maddie, did you
make me crepe suzette?

11:54.981 --> 11:57.248
No! I made you...
( trails off )

11:57.250 --> 11:58.483
Crepe suzette.

12:00.420 --> 12:02.454
Nana.

12:04.224 --> 12:06.224
Have you seen
my stuffed elephie?

12:06.226 --> 12:08.593
I can't take my nap
without it.

12:08.595 --> 12:12.230
I'm just so tir--
( yawns )

12:16.002 --> 12:18.503
No? Nothing?

12:18.505 --> 12:20.638
Did you see the slippers?
Fine!

12:25.612 --> 12:30.281
( telescope in female voice ):
<i>Mcgilroy-mimen jk113</i>
<i>approaching.</i>

12:30.283 --> 12:34.452
<i>Comet apex occurring</i>
<i>in 15 minutes.</i>

12:34.454 --> 12:35.553
<i>( telescope beeps )</i>

12:35.555 --> 12:38.356
Oh, your telescope speaks.

12:38.358 --> 12:41.292
( chuckles )
please introduce me.

12:43.430 --> 12:47.398
For once in our lives, artie,
we are surrounded by real girls.

12:47.400 --> 12:50.502
We do not have to talk
to the telescope tonight,
all right?

12:52.139 --> 12:53.605
You're right.
( chuckles )

12:53.607 --> 12:56.274
Minions, go warm up
the girls for me.

12:56.276 --> 12:58.843
I'll re-scrunch my bangs
and be on my way.

13:03.750 --> 13:07.152
Oh, alex,
what a lovely surprise.

13:07.154 --> 13:08.953
How is this a surprise?

13:08.955 --> 13:11.756
I was invited.
There's a comet.

13:11.758 --> 13:13.424
You have the best telescope.

13:13.426 --> 13:17.495
Probability of my presence
was 99.99999999%.

13:17.497 --> 13:19.430
Well,
you didn't let me finish.

13:19.432 --> 13:23.835
I'm 0.000000001% surprised.

13:25.906 --> 13:28.439
Huh, I will now turn up
the corners of my lips

13:28.441 --> 13:29.707
To signify that
this was amusing.

13:32.279 --> 13:34.679
Well, see you outside
for the apex.

13:34.681 --> 13:38.016
( both nervously giggle )

13:40.287 --> 13:43.021
Hark, do my eyes
see it's samantha?

13:43.023 --> 13:46.357
The first of two heavenly bodies
we shall gaze upon tonight.

13:47.527 --> 13:52.297
Indeed, kind sir.
Whilst thou shareth
a crab nebula cake?

13:52.299 --> 13:55.733
With you'th, I will... Ith.

13:57.637 --> 14:01.139
See you under the stars when
perchance our fates are sealed.

14:01.141 --> 14:02.373
( both giggle )

14:02.375 --> 14:04.609
And that means?

14:04.611 --> 14:07.378
I'll catch you come comet time.

14:07.380 --> 14:08.947
I was hoping that's
what that meant.

14:08.949 --> 14:10.849
( both giggle )

14:13.820 --> 14:17.021
Hahaha, brie, welcome.

14:17.023 --> 14:19.624
Hi, joey.
Or tonight should I call you

14:19.626 --> 14:22.994
Commander comet,
agent of the galaxy?

14:22.996 --> 14:26.965
Commander?
That means you outrank me,
admiral foxy.

14:26.967 --> 14:29.467
( both growl )

14:29.469 --> 14:32.320
( both giggle )

14:32.321 --> 14:35.172
Three girls, one joey,
and a comet to decide it all.

14:35.175 --> 14:37.575
What could possibly go wrong?

14:38.378 --> 14:40.545
-Hey, joey.
-( high-pitched shriek )

14:42.015 --> 14:43.248
Willow,
what are you doing here?

14:43.250 --> 14:44.549
I was invited.

14:44.551 --> 14:47.385
What? Who invited yo--
( gasps )

14:48.321 --> 14:49.988
Artie!

14:49.990 --> 14:51.823
Present.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.426
What did you do?

14:55.428 --> 14:58.496
Oh, was I not supposed
to invite willow,

14:58.498 --> 15:00.598
Thus ruining
any chance you have with
any of the other girls,

15:00.600 --> 15:02.166
And leaving them
all for me?

15:02.168 --> 15:03.735
Oops, my bad.

15:03.737 --> 15:06.905
Minions, "operation:
Joey's cast-offs" is a go.

15:11.444 --> 15:13.578
Hey, uh,  <i> grandma.</i>

15:13.580 --> 15:15.680
( chuckles )
this is a really big event.

15:15.682 --> 15:17.515
Um, wow, you know what?

15:17.517 --> 15:19.550
We should do our
pre-game warm-up ritual

15:19.552 --> 15:21.052
That we always do
before big events

15:21.054 --> 15:23.888
That you should
totally know by heart,
because we do it all the time.

15:23.890 --> 15:25.390
Okay, maddie, honey.
Grandma's tired.

15:25.392 --> 15:28.126
-She's been traveling a long--
-it's fine, karen.

15:28.128 --> 15:31.796
Both:
Ready, set...
( grunts )

15:31.798 --> 15:35.867
Glub, glub...
( warbles gibberish )

15:35.869 --> 15:36.901
She dribbles,
she shoots.

15:36.903 --> 15:39.237
Both:
She scores!

15:39.239 --> 15:40.605
Bam! What?!

15:43.076 --> 15:45.243
That proves nothing.

15:45.245 --> 15:48.379
Maddie,
you are being very rude
to aunt hilary.

15:48.381 --> 15:50.048
( gasps )

15:50.050 --> 15:51.382
Oh, dear.

15:53.219 --> 15:55.153
Seriously, karen?

15:55.155 --> 15:57.255
I spent an hour

15:57.257 --> 16:00.858
Face-gabbing with janice
just to get that routine down.

16:02.462 --> 16:04.562
I knew it!

16:04.564 --> 16:06.431
I was right!

16:06.433 --> 16:09.100
Who's crazy-pants?!
Not me!

16:09.102 --> 16:11.736
Hahaha!
I'm righty-pants!

16:15.608 --> 16:19.143
Aunt hilary,
why would you pretend
to be grandma janice?

16:19.145 --> 16:21.079
Bad weather
kept my sister

16:21.081 --> 16:23.114
From being able
to fly out of africa.

16:23.116 --> 16:27.185
When she realized she wouldn't
be at the ceremony in time,

16:27.187 --> 16:29.320
She sent me in her place.

16:29.322 --> 16:32.190
See, grandma was so honored
to present the award

16:32.192 --> 16:34.192
And we knew liv
would be devastated,

16:34.194 --> 16:37.095
-So I helped aunt hilary--
-pull a switcheroo?

16:37.097 --> 16:40.465
-Mom, you hate switcheroos.
-I do. I do, it's true.

16:40.467 --> 16:43.301
But when it's for a good cause
I can make an exception.

16:43.303 --> 16:46.104
You know? Who am I kidding?
I do whatever my mother
tells me to do.

16:46.106 --> 16:48.039
I'm weak! I don't have
a twin to keep me strong!

16:48.041 --> 16:50.475
You know, I'm gonna call
this charade off right now,
right now.

16:50.477 --> 16:52.043
No, no,
mom, mom, mom, mom.

16:52.045 --> 16:54.278
We are not saying
a word to liv.

16:54.280 --> 16:57.148
We're not gonna just
ruin her big night.

16:57.150 --> 16:59.117
I mean, she's way too excited
to have grandma here.

17:00.854 --> 17:01.953
Grandma!

17:03.990 --> 17:05.790
You look lovely tonight.

17:05.792 --> 17:07.959
Can I offer you
some pretzel bread?

17:07.961 --> 17:11.062
You are so adorable.

17:11.064 --> 17:14.298
Here, sweetheart,
I have something for you.

17:16.202 --> 17:17.802
It's a mint.

17:20.073 --> 17:22.240
Your breath is a little n...

17:25.178 --> 17:28.379
( snorts, laughs )
plus, I mean, there's no way

17:28.381 --> 17:30.181
We can pull the plug
on that whole show.

17:30.183 --> 17:31.249
Oh.

17:33.853 --> 17:36.254
-Let's go mingle.
-No, or we can
stay right here.

17:37.924 --> 17:40.491
Okay, joey, I get it.
You threw a party and
you didn't invite me,

17:40.493 --> 17:42.393
But I'll forgive you.

17:43.329 --> 17:44.495
Par-- a party?

17:44.497 --> 17:45.863
What are you talking about?

17:45.865 --> 17:47.265
I don't know these people.

17:47.267 --> 17:49.233
They all broke in.

17:50.603 --> 17:53.504
You know what?
If you can't see that
we're meant to be together,

17:53.506 --> 17:55.740
Then I give up.
Good-bye, joey.

17:55.742 --> 17:57.075
Wh...

17:58.711 --> 18:01.679
<i>( guests chattering )</i>

18:01.681 --> 18:03.514
( sighs ) tsk.

18:03.516 --> 18:06.784
Checking for guilt:
No, I'm good.

18:06.786 --> 18:09.320
( happy humming )

18:11.191 --> 18:14.926
Telescope:
<i>Comet apex in 5 minutes.</i>

18:15.862 --> 18:17.528
So, alex,

18:17.530 --> 18:21.299
Who were you with
the last time m.M. Jk113
came around?

18:21.301 --> 18:23.134
My home chemistry set.

18:24.571 --> 18:26.304
I still have a special thing
for boron.

18:26.306 --> 18:30.241
Oh, my favorite element
is fluoride.

18:30.243 --> 18:34.011
Perhaps we should form
a covalent bond, ba!

18:35.615 --> 18:37.148
No offense, artie,
but I was invited here

18:37.150 --> 18:38.616
To share the apex with joey.

18:38.618 --> 18:41.052
And I despise fluoride,

18:41.054 --> 18:42.720
And you.

18:42.722 --> 18:46.257
Wait, wait a second.
I was invited to share
the apex with joey.

18:46.259 --> 18:49.827
( robotic voice )
no, I'm spending
the apex with joey.

18:49.829 --> 18:51.562
Sorry.

18:51.564 --> 18:55.266
( normal voice, whining )
I'm spending the apex with joey!

18:55.268 --> 18:57.869
Oh, wow.

18:59.239 --> 19:03.441
Did that scoundrel invite
three soul mates to the apex?

19:03.443 --> 19:05.843
( gasps )
you must be crushed.

19:05.845 --> 19:09.480
My arms are open to comfort
any or all of you.

19:11.151 --> 19:12.250
( humming happily )

19:14.320 --> 19:16.487
Hey.

19:16.489 --> 19:18.256
Girls.

19:18.258 --> 19:21.159
Did you invite
all three of us

19:21.161 --> 19:22.860
To watch the lovers' comet
with you?

19:22.862 --> 19:25.763
( stutters ) maybe.

19:25.765 --> 19:28.199
It turns out
that commander comet

19:28.201 --> 19:29.700
Is just a three-timing jerk!

19:29.702 --> 19:33.337
-( sighs )
-statistically, a good play,
but hurtful.

19:34.941 --> 19:37.041
( in robotic voice )
ladies, let's bounce!

19:42.448 --> 19:45.716
And so without further ado,

19:45.718 --> 19:50.955
I present to you
the porcupine of the year,
my granddaughter,

19:50.957 --> 19:54.792
-Liv rooney!
-( applause )

19:54.794 --> 19:56.260
( maddie cheers )

19:59.132 --> 20:00.898
Thank you, grandma janice.

20:00.900 --> 20:03.968
Friends, family,

20:03.970 --> 20:06.804
Fellow porcupines...
( laughs )

20:06.806 --> 20:09.373
It is with great honor
that I accept--

20:09.375 --> 20:10.241
Woman:
<i>Hold on!</i>

20:10.243 --> 20:13.377
Liv, grandma's here!

20:13.379 --> 20:15.379
Liv:
<i>Wait, uh, grandma?</i>

20:15.381 --> 20:17.848
Ha, wait, but no you're...

20:17.850 --> 20:20.151
<i>( liv gasps )</i>
<i>aunt hilary?!</i>

20:20.153 --> 20:23.387
You guys pulled
a twin switcheroo
on another twin?

20:23.389 --> 20:25.690
That's low.

20:25.692 --> 20:27.925
Okay, honey,
I know this looks bad.

20:27.927 --> 20:29.393
Mom, you knew
about this?!

20:29.395 --> 20:30.861
-Maddie did too!
-Mom!

20:30.863 --> 20:32.096
Well, you did.

20:32.098 --> 20:35.666
Uh, well, liv, um...

20:35.668 --> 20:38.669
Grandma was worried that
she wouldn't get here on time,

20:38.671 --> 20:41.072
So she had aunt hilary
pretend to be her.

20:41.074 --> 20:44.408
And it was going very well
until janice barged in here

20:44.410 --> 20:45.710
And messed the whole thing up.

20:45.712 --> 20:48.012
Maddie:
<i>Yeah, seriously, g-ma,</i>

20:48.014 --> 20:50.248
You couldn't of just,
like, texted aunt hilary

20:50.250 --> 20:52.250
That it was
time to switch back?

20:52.252 --> 20:54.418
Because that is
switcheroo 101.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.787
Hey, give me a break!

20:56.789 --> 21:02.126
I just spent 11 hours
in a gutted 747 with
a quart of water

21:02.128 --> 21:04.095
That I had to share
with a monkey.

21:04.097 --> 21:07.331
Ah, now that's
grandma janice.

21:09.202 --> 21:10.968
Liv, I'm sorry.

21:10.970 --> 21:12.870
I know this is
a big night for you

21:12.872 --> 21:14.972
And I really
wanted to be here...

21:15.908 --> 21:17.942
Even if I wasn't here.

21:19.579 --> 21:25.416
Well, I mean, you know,
if you did all this for me
and not for maddie,

21:25.418 --> 21:28.886
I guess there really is just
one conclusion to come to.

21:30.423 --> 21:33.124
I'm grandma's favorite!
( chuckles )

21:33.126 --> 21:36.927
Girls,
I don't have favorites.

21:36.929 --> 21:39.563
They sound like us.
Remember, hilary?

21:39.565 --> 21:41.465
You always thought
you were grandma's favorite.

21:41.467 --> 21:43.467
-I was.
-No, I was.

21:43.469 --> 21:45.403
-( liv giggles )
-( maddie snorts )

21:45.405 --> 21:47.171
What a crazy pair.

21:48.741 --> 21:51.509
Hey, um, grandma,

21:51.511 --> 21:54.445
Now that  <i> you</i>
are really here,

21:54.447 --> 21:57.515
Do you think that you could
present my award to me?,

21:57.517 --> 21:59.684
Aww, I would love to.

22:01.854 --> 22:03.154
Hold the phone!

22:05.458 --> 22:07.425
I've got some business
with this one.

22:07.427 --> 22:11.696
I think I'm the one
who suffered the most
in this ordeal.

22:11.698 --> 22:13.364
Someone needs to pay up.

22:14.967 --> 22:17.368
Hilary, I told you
to give him 20 bucks.

22:17.370 --> 22:21.038
I was going to,
but then I spent it
on scratchers.

22:22.809 --> 22:24.875
Respect.

22:34.787 --> 22:38.055
Well, this backyard smells
of failure and solitude.

22:39.892 --> 22:40.825
Minions...

22:40.827 --> 22:42.860
( snaps )
let's be off.

22:45.798 --> 22:50.034
Telescope:
<i>Comet apex in 10 seconds.</i>

22:51.871 --> 22:54.071
-Hey, joey.
-Of course.

22:55.975 --> 22:57.475
I forgot my jacket.

22:57.477 --> 22:59.543
Yeah, well,
you may as well
come take a look.

22:59.545 --> 23:01.212
<i>Come on.</i>

23:02.181 --> 23:05.616
Telescope:
<i>Comet apex is occurring.</i>

23:06.919 --> 23:08.753
I didn't even wear a jacket.

23:08.755 --> 23:11.989
Come on,
it's the lovers' comet.

23:11.991 --> 23:14.859
We're back.
Look at you two.

23:14.861 --> 23:17.895
Aren't you
an adorable couple?

23:19.732 --> 23:20.965
( whispers )
grandma, help me.

23:20.967 --> 23:25.669
What do you mean?
This comet is how I landed
your grandfather.

23:25.671 --> 23:27.571
-( gasps )
-( hyperventilates )

23:31.277 --> 23:32.977
Maddie:
<i>What a crazy pair.</i>

23:33.913 --> 23:35.479
<i>( boings )</i>
