WEBVTT

02:05.000 --> 02:06.500
Today isn't your day, is it?

03:00.583 --> 03:01.625
What will it be?

03:02.666 --> 03:04.333
Point me to the alderman's house.

03:04.416 --> 03:06.833
-It's down the alley to the left--
-Isadora.

03:13.750 --> 03:15.666
We don't want your kind here, Witcher.

03:16.666 --> 03:17.666
The alderman,

03:18.375 --> 03:20.791
tell me where he is
and I'll be on my way.

03:21.958 --> 03:23.916
You don't give the orders around here...

03:24.000 --> 03:26.333
you mutant son of a bitch.

03:29.208 --> 03:31.291
- Hear that?

03:31.375 --> 03:32.375
Go.

03:32.458 --> 03:35.416
On your own or at the end of a rope,
your choice.

03:36.833 --> 03:37.875
Not a hard choice.

03:38.250 --> 03:40.625
Yeah, fuck that. Kill him
with your bare hands if you have to.

03:43.083 --> 03:45.458
C'mon, Witcher.
You're not scared of us, are ya?

03:48.500 --> 03:51.500
-Show us what you've got.
-Can you not leave it alone for a moment?

03:58.291 --> 04:01.083
-Witchers can't be trusted.
- I'm not speaking to you.

04:03.083 --> 04:05.833
I apologize
for my man's interference in your day.

04:08.291 --> 04:11.500
Hopefully he can improve his behavior
by tomorrow's market.

04:13.750 --> 04:15.041
Sorry, Renfri.

04:18.291 --> 04:19.500
Come on, lads.

04:21.666 --> 04:23.666
Beer for my friend here and one for me.

04:27.875 --> 04:30.125
I am speaking to you now, good sir.

04:43.541 --> 04:44.666
Want some breakfast?

04:46.833 --> 04:47.833
I'm full.

04:49.750 --> 04:50.625
Venison.

05:13.833 --> 05:16.208
My mother, God rest her,
would be mortified.

05:17.833 --> 05:19.041
Our secret, then.

05:28.208 --> 05:30.375
So, what brings you to Blaviken,
White Hair?

05:30.833 --> 05:32.166
You came for a monster?

05:33.125 --> 05:34.666
I was traveling by the swamp.

05:34.750 --> 05:38.041
That would be your mistake, then.
Why wouldn't you travel by main roads?

05:39.625 --> 05:41.333
It's hard to make a living on main roads.

05:42.208 --> 05:44.541
And you desperately need money
for new clothes.

05:50.250 --> 05:51.250
Two more beers.

06:08.166 --> 06:10.708
More and more,
I find monsters wherever I go.

06:23.833 --> 06:25.750
How much coin for your kikimora, then?

06:40.083 --> 06:42.250
I killed a rat this morning
with my breakfast fork.

06:42.958 --> 06:44.958
Stabbed it in its fat little gut.

06:45.541 --> 06:47.750
My mother nearly fainted,
but what was I supposed to do?

06:47.833 --> 06:50.000
It had been shitting in our pantry
for days.

06:54.791 --> 06:57.000
- You mentioned coin.
- Yes.

06:57.500 --> 06:59.666
Isadora said you were looking
for my father.

07:00.166 --> 07:01.750
She's a gossip, you see.

07:01.833 --> 07:03.791
Probably went two steps
into the Lord's Inn

07:03.875 --> 07:07.083
before she was running off telling
everyone an evil witcher had arrived.

07:10.041 --> 07:11.083
You don't scare me.

07:11.791 --> 07:12.958
That's too bad.

07:13.041 --> 07:15.125
And I can also tell you

07:15.791 --> 07:17.958
that my father will have no use
for this beast.

07:18.041 --> 07:19.000
Your father,

07:19.708 --> 07:20.708
the alderman?

07:21.916 --> 07:23.250
He posted a flyer.

07:24.333 --> 07:25.375
For a graveir.

07:26.000 --> 07:27.291
kikimoras are useful.

07:28.458 --> 07:29.708
Population control.

07:31.625 --> 07:32.833
Hm.

07:33.666 --> 07:35.500
You should speak to Master Irion,
our wizard.

07:36.958 --> 07:39.875
He's willing to pay for odds and ends
he needs for elixirs.

07:41.000 --> 07:42.625
I sold him our dog when it died.

07:43.458 --> 07:44.375
Mysteriously.

07:47.500 --> 07:48.333
Fine.

07:48.958 --> 07:50.083
Take me to him.

07:51.625 --> 07:54.000
I got 15 crowns for the yappy mutt.

07:55.833 --> 07:59.208
That's enough to buy some new clothes.
Just saying.

08:01.041 --> 08:02.125
Hm.

08:02.208 --> 08:03.333
Come on, Roach.

08:08.125 --> 08:10.041
Have you ever killed a succubus?

08:10.375 --> 08:11.666
A striga?

08:12.583 --> 08:13.625
Werewolf?

08:14.291 --> 08:15.708
She-wolf?

08:15.791 --> 08:16.958
That's not a thing.

08:17.625 --> 08:19.041
So you've killed the rest?

08:19.583 --> 08:21.083
I think that makes you a hero.

08:22.250 --> 08:25.166
My mother says
you're the offspring of foul sorcery,

08:25.250 --> 08:28.666
a diabolic creation,
a filthy degenerate born of Hell.

08:29.791 --> 08:31.250
Have you ever been to Hell?

08:32.333 --> 08:33.875
I've never even left Blaviken.

08:33.958 --> 08:35.541
Because my mother's never left Blaviken,

08:35.625 --> 08:39.000
and if it's good enough for Libushe,
then it's good enough for Marilka.

08:39.083 --> 08:40.666
-That's my name.

08:40.750 --> 08:41.625
Marilka.

08:42.666 --> 08:43.666
Like milk.

08:45.208 --> 08:46.208
What's your name?

08:47.208 --> 08:48.208
Geralt.

08:49.250 --> 08:50.333
Like garroter?

08:51.333 --> 08:52.333
Nice.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.375
Where are you from, Geralt?

08:55.208 --> 08:56.250
Rivia.

08:58.125 --> 09:01.708
I don't know where that is,
but I could learn, if you'd let me.

09:02.291 --> 09:03.250
No.

09:04.625 --> 09:07.375
Because I'm a girl
and girls can't be witchers.

09:07.833 --> 09:10.250
Which I think is probably
the stupidest thing I've ever heard.

09:10.333 --> 09:11.250
Hm.

09:12.083 --> 09:13.041
I want more.

09:14.083 --> 09:15.083
I have to be more,

09:15.166 --> 09:17.791
because I don't know what to do
in Blaviken for the rest of my life,

09:17.875 --> 09:19.625
except go to the boring old market.

09:20.500 --> 09:21.541
And kill rats.

09:22.041 --> 09:23.083
And dogs.

09:28.583 --> 09:29.708
Here we are.

09:36.708 --> 09:37.791
Hold Roach.

09:38.500 --> 09:40.083
-Be nice.

09:41.666 --> 09:42.750
Hey, Roach.

10:21.416 --> 10:22.375
Greetings.

10:23.666 --> 10:24.791
I am Stregobor.

10:27.458 --> 10:29.291
Master Stregobor.

10:30.166 --> 10:31.041
Sorcerer.

10:31.125 --> 10:33.250
I have a kikimora for Master Irion.

10:33.333 --> 10:35.708
Yes, well, forgive the confusion.

10:35.791 --> 10:39.458
Irion created this tower,
but he's been dead 200 years.

10:40.416 --> 10:43.625
So, in order to honor him,
I've taken his name as my...

10:44.333 --> 10:46.416
personal sobriquet.

10:46.916 --> 10:48.083
Hm.

10:48.166 --> 10:49.791
He create this illusion, too?

10:49.875 --> 10:51.541
No, this is, uh... this is...

10:52.541 --> 10:54.041
my own creation.

10:55.458 --> 10:57.250
Helps pass time more delightfully.

10:58.000 --> 11:00.666
Because you're in hiding, Stregobor.

11:00.750 --> 11:02.208
How very clever of you...

11:03.458 --> 11:04.458
Witcher.

11:12.500 --> 11:15.000
Not often do we see your likeness
here in Blaviken.

11:15.083 --> 11:16.791
Not many of my likeness left.

11:17.333 --> 11:18.291
Hm.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.791
I'd offer you my condolences, but...

11:22.625 --> 11:24.958
I seem to remember
that witchers don't feel...

11:25.875 --> 11:26.875
anything.

11:28.625 --> 11:30.708
I'm grateful destiny brought you to me.

11:30.791 --> 11:32.000
Marilka brought me to you.

11:32.083 --> 11:34.416
Oh, Marilka. Marilka works for me.

11:35.958 --> 11:36.958
Now and then.

11:38.208 --> 11:39.958
On matters of great import.

11:40.833 --> 11:43.291
A reclusive sorcerer who uses an alias

11:43.375 --> 11:46.083
and hires a young girl
to procure him a witcher.

11:47.000 --> 11:48.333
You don't want my monster.

11:49.791 --> 11:51.333
You want me to kill yours.

11:51.416 --> 11:52.416
Very clever.

11:53.333 --> 11:54.166
Indeed.

11:54.250 --> 11:56.083
-What kind?
-The worst kind.

11:58.083 --> 11:59.166
The human kind.

12:00.583 --> 12:01.958
Its name is Renfri.

12:05.291 --> 12:06.500
Hm.

12:16.208 --> 12:17.208
-Damn it.

12:18.083 --> 12:19.416
-Go on, Martin.

12:20.166 --> 12:21.458
-Ah! Five.
-Yeah!

12:22.250 --> 12:24.541
-Not yet.
-There's no way you can get five.

12:24.625 --> 12:26.791
You're not taking a bite of that bread
before I try.

12:35.958 --> 12:38.166
-Better throw those knuckles.
-Go on, then.

12:39.833 --> 12:41.208
-Told ya.

12:44.125 --> 12:45.833
I didn't steal the bread. Korin did!

12:45.916 --> 12:47.916
-Quick! Quick!
-Hey, shut up, you twat!

12:50.000 --> 12:51.541
You need to come with us.

12:56.833 --> 13:00.041
As your Queen,
I grant you this commendation,

13:00.625 --> 13:04.125
which will symbolize your duty
and bond as liegemen

13:04.208 --> 13:06.708
in fealty to the crown of Cintra.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.291
Could use with a bit of feel-ty myself
right now.

13:20.208 --> 13:21.041
Gross.

13:21.125 --> 13:24.666
Do you promise to defend
to your utmost the weak, the orphaned...

13:24.750 --> 13:28.416
-Late wee pups don't get to bark.
-I was playing in the square.

13:28.500 --> 13:29.625
...speak only the truth...

13:29.708 --> 13:31.916
-Knucklebones?
-...loyal and brave...

13:32.000 --> 13:33.958
Did you win this time?
Like I showed you.

13:34.041 --> 13:35.708
-...at any cost...
-I would have,

13:35.791 --> 13:38.291
if the horsemen of doom hadn't
ridden up like that.

13:38.375 --> 13:40.833
-I grant you this...
-If you can't win a game of knucklebones

13:40.916 --> 13:42.791
-for fear of a few horses...
-...duty and bond...

13:42.875 --> 13:44.541
...what'll you do when you go into battle?

13:44.625 --> 13:47.125
-...in fealty to the crown of Cintra.

13:47.208 --> 13:49.458
At least you didn't shit your kecks.

13:51.500 --> 13:52.791
As members of the Royal Family,

13:52.875 --> 13:57.166
is it too much to ask
that you exercise a modicum of respect?

13:58.458 --> 13:59.541
Especially you.

14:00.833 --> 14:03.958
This is your duty
as king and grandfather.

14:06.416 --> 14:09.416
Grant me leave, my Queen.
I am worn from my trip to the Isles.

14:11.708 --> 14:13.916
And my bedchamber duties before that.

14:14.708 --> 14:15.583
Gross.

14:16.625 --> 14:17.750
-As your Queen,

14:17.833 --> 14:20.291
I grant you this commendation,

14:20.375 --> 14:22.750
which will symbolize
your duty and bond...

14:22.833 --> 14:26.125
<i>Destiny has many faces, Witcher.</i>

14:26.916 --> 14:29.416
Mine, for example,
is beautiful on the outside, but...

14:30.000 --> 14:31.250
hideous on the inside.

14:31.916 --> 14:34.833
She has stretched her bloody talons
towards me.

14:34.916 --> 14:36.250
Wizards are all the same.

14:36.875 --> 14:40.041
You talk nonsense
while making wise and meaningful faces.

14:42.041 --> 14:44.166
Speak normally.

14:48.250 --> 14:49.708
Have you ever heard of the...

14:50.541 --> 14:51.916
Curse of the Black Sun?

14:53.125 --> 14:56.041
First full eclipse in 1,200 years.

14:56.125 --> 14:58.125
It marked the imminent return
of Lilit,

14:59.125 --> 15:02.958
demon goddess of the night
sent to exterminate the human race.

15:04.041 --> 15:06.000
According to the wise mage Eltibald,

15:07.000 --> 15:11.125
Lilit's path was to be prepared
by 60 women wearing gold crowns

15:11.208 --> 15:13.666
who'd fill the river valleys with blood.

15:13.750 --> 15:14.583
Hm.

15:15.416 --> 15:16.416
Doesn't rhyme.

15:17.416 --> 15:18.791
All good predictions rhyme.

15:19.375 --> 15:22.750
I studied the girls born
around the Black Sun,

15:22.833 --> 15:26.541
and I found horrendous
internal mutations among them.

15:27.750 --> 15:29.000
I tried to cure them,

15:29.625 --> 15:31.541
locked them in towers for safekeeping,

15:31.625 --> 15:34.041
but the girls always died.

15:34.125 --> 15:36.583
Internal mutations?

15:37.125 --> 15:40.583
They were autopsied, of course,
to confirm my suspicions.

15:41.541 --> 15:44.708
But eliminating these women was
the lesser evil.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.333
They could've drowned entire kingdoms
in blood.

15:49.000 --> 15:52.250
If you'd been alive during
Falka's Rebellion, seen what I saw--

15:52.333 --> 15:54.041
Innocent women are dead.

15:58.833 --> 15:59.916
Hm.

16:00.375 --> 16:02.833
But not Renfri, the beautiful one.

16:04.791 --> 16:06.541
She's after you.

16:06.625 --> 16:08.708
Daughter of King Fredefalk of Creyden.

16:09.791 --> 16:12.875
I delivered the princess myself
in the middle of the afternoon

16:12.958 --> 16:13.958
in pitch black.

16:14.041 --> 16:17.083
Under the Black Sun, so... she's cursed.

16:17.166 --> 16:18.916
Do you consider me a fool, Witcher?

16:19.541 --> 16:23.333
Do you think I did not conduct research?
Renfri was acutely affected.

16:23.416 --> 16:27.250
Her stepmother, Aridea,
told me she tortured a canary,

16:27.333 --> 16:28.583
strangled two puppies,

16:28.666 --> 16:31.458
even gouged out her maid's eye
with a comb.

16:32.625 --> 16:35.291
I admit what happened next was not ideal,
but...

16:36.208 --> 16:39.583
with the lives of Aridea's own children
on the line, we had to act.

16:40.416 --> 16:44.333
So I dispatched someone
to follow Renfri into the woods.

16:44.416 --> 16:45.916
We found him in the brush,

16:46.000 --> 16:48.708
Renfri's antique brooch
jammed into his ear.

16:51.041 --> 16:55.166
After that, I organized a manhunt
to find the princess, but... eh...

16:55.833 --> 16:56.791
she was gone.

16:58.083 --> 16:59.083
Two years.

17:00.000 --> 17:01.541
Until she reappeared,

17:01.625 --> 17:04.458
robbing and murdering merchants
on the roads of Mahakam.

17:04.541 --> 17:06.958
Impaled them on sticks at first,
but soon,

17:07.958 --> 17:09.458
she picked up sword skills.

17:10.750 --> 17:13.250
And now no man can defy her, it's said.

17:13.333 --> 17:15.875
You're not a man. You're a magician.

17:15.958 --> 17:18.916
-She's resistant to magic.
-That's impossible in humans.

17:19.750 --> 17:20.625
Not...

17:21.875 --> 17:23.000
mutated ones.

17:24.125 --> 17:26.375
She's chased me for years,
bent on revenge.

17:26.458 --> 17:29.916
And now she's tracked me here,
just as you arrived.

17:31.791 --> 17:32.625
Destiny.

17:35.708 --> 17:36.791
Kill her.

17:38.791 --> 17:40.083
I'll pay you anything.

17:40.166 --> 17:41.625
I kill monsters.

17:41.708 --> 17:45.125
The kikimora kills because it's hungry,
Renfri kills for pleasure.

17:45.208 --> 17:48.291
She is a monster.
She is the last of Lilit's women.

17:49.125 --> 17:51.833
And she possesses the power
to destroy us all.

17:52.541 --> 17:55.208
I don't believe anyone has that power.

17:59.708 --> 18:03.708
With the fate of the Continent at stake,
is that a chance you're willing to take?

18:05.000 --> 18:06.000
There's your rhyme.

18:09.708 --> 18:11.416
Killing Renfri is...

18:11.916 --> 18:13.416
the lesser evil.

18:14.875 --> 18:16.416
Evil is evil, Stregobor.

18:17.208 --> 18:19.291
Lesser, greater,

18:20.166 --> 18:21.166
middling...

18:22.166 --> 18:23.166
it's all the same.

18:24.375 --> 18:25.791
I'm not judging you.

18:25.875 --> 18:28.083
I haven't only done good
in my life either.

18:30.000 --> 18:31.000
But now,

18:31.958 --> 18:35.333
if I have to choose
between one evil and another,

18:37.666 --> 18:39.416
then I prefer not to choose at all.

18:59.416 --> 19:03.166
These shindigs need a touch
of the old abracadabra.

19:04.333 --> 19:06.000
At your service, Your Majesty.

19:06.083 --> 19:08.083
Tricks and illusions to delight.

19:08.583 --> 19:11.750
He means to pull a disappearing act.
don't you?

19:12.458 --> 19:13.875
-No.
-Hm.

19:23.625 --> 19:26.541
I saw the Wraiths of Mörhogg
over the channel this morning.

19:26.625 --> 19:28.291
Yes, you mentioned.

19:28.375 --> 19:29.875
-Who?
-No good will come of it.

19:29.958 --> 19:31.583
They're an omen of war.

19:31.666 --> 19:34.125
The North has been at war
since Nilfgaard took Ebbing.

19:34.583 --> 19:38.375
If legend is true,
the Wild Hunt's years behind the curve.

19:38.791 --> 19:41.583
The Nilfgaardian force
crossed the Amell Pass.

19:41.666 --> 19:43.500
Headed to Sodden, if they're smart.

19:43.583 --> 19:47.291
And if not, 50 of your Skelligen ships
are on the way.

19:47.375 --> 19:50.000
We have more knights.
We are prepared in case--

19:50.083 --> 19:51.166
Prepared for what?

19:54.333 --> 19:56.291
Nothing for you to be concerned about.

19:57.041 --> 19:58.916
Your dismissive tone says it is.

19:59.000 --> 20:00.833
We're talking of war, girl.

20:01.833 --> 20:02.875
With Nilfgaard?

20:04.416 --> 20:05.416
-Why?
-Eist!

20:05.500 --> 20:08.583
Should we fall to Nilfgaard,
your granddaughter will rule.

20:09.333 --> 20:11.041
She needs to understand the way of things.

20:11.125 --> 20:14.125
We will not fall,
because we are not under attack!

20:15.458 --> 20:16.791
She's a child.

20:17.666 --> 20:20.625
You won your first battle in Hochebuz
when you were my age.

20:21.375 --> 20:22.583
I've heard the ballad.

20:22.666 --> 20:24.708
Pretty ballads hide bastard truths.

20:26.500 --> 20:27.583
It's a catchy song.

20:27.666 --> 20:29.416
Three thousand of my men died.

20:33.375 --> 20:34.750
If we must do this now,

20:35.375 --> 20:36.708
here is your first lesson.

20:38.833 --> 20:43.125
As in life, it is impossible always
to be fully prepared for battle.

20:44.458 --> 20:46.208
Keep your sword close...

20:47.041 --> 20:48.291
and keep moving.

20:50.875 --> 20:53.000
Your Majesty... Your Majesty.

20:53.625 --> 20:56.541
Thank you for allowing our company
at this splendid affair.

20:57.166 --> 20:59.375
Your Majesties. Your Highness.

21:02.416 --> 21:03.916
Would you honor me with a dance?

21:05.458 --> 21:07.291
Uh... Martin--

21:07.375 --> 21:08.541
She'd love to.

21:36.541 --> 21:39.791
Reminds me
of your daughter's betrothal feast.

21:41.625 --> 21:45.166
The night you finally saw sense, said yes.

21:46.125 --> 21:48.375
Made me the happiest man
on the Continent.

21:49.708 --> 21:51.625
I did it to save my kingdom.

21:52.791 --> 21:53.625
And, no,

21:54.458 --> 21:56.666
you may not leave this shindig.

22:05.583 --> 22:07.625
Your Majesty, my scouts have returned.

22:09.416 --> 22:11.416
Nilfgaard is on its way to Cintra.

22:18.500 --> 22:19.875
I stand corrected.

22:24.291 --> 22:25.291
They're here.

22:29.166 --> 22:30.583
They're already here.

22:36.625 --> 22:38.291
So much for being smart.

22:40.541 --> 22:41.916
You should tell the girl.

22:44.833 --> 22:47.000
Let her enjoy this night in peace.

22:48.916 --> 22:50.708
It may be her last for a while.

23:36.333 --> 23:37.583
The girl this morning,

23:38.958 --> 23:40.708
she took you to see Stregobor,
didn't she?

23:46.333 --> 23:49.291
I know who you are, Renfri.

23:51.333 --> 23:53.541
You know that I want
to kill Stregobor, then.

23:55.875 --> 23:58.916
I used to be a princess.
Did he tell you that?

24:01.541 --> 24:04.166
Until he sent a thug into the woods
to kill me.

24:04.250 --> 24:05.375
You killed him.

24:06.000 --> 24:07.291
With my mother's brooch.

24:32.583 --> 24:34.500
Stregobor's man raped me...

24:37.208 --> 24:38.750
robbed me and let me go.

24:41.958 --> 24:43.250
No more princess.

24:47.250 --> 24:48.416
I had to survive.

24:50.291 --> 24:52.666
I stole rather than starve.

24:53.708 --> 24:55.416
I killed rather than be killed.

24:59.083 --> 25:00.833
Nohorn and the others saved me.

25:02.833 --> 25:06.125
And they'll be by my side at the market
as I get my revenge.

25:06.208 --> 25:09.416
Lilit help me,
I will take down anyone in my way.

25:14.083 --> 25:15.125
Unless...

25:16.416 --> 25:17.916
destiny intervenes.

25:25.791 --> 25:27.791
You want me to kill Stregobor for you.

25:29.458 --> 25:30.791
It's the lesser evil.

25:31.458 --> 25:33.083
So I keep getting told.

25:41.416 --> 25:43.166
Stregobor asked you to kill me too.

25:44.958 --> 25:47.375
'Cause I was a girl born
during an eclipse?

25:49.125 --> 25:51.291
I could've become so many things.

25:52.583 --> 25:54.041
Queen Calanthe of Cintra,

25:54.583 --> 25:56.708
she just won her first battle at Hochebuz.

25:58.000 --> 26:00.708
But here I am trying
to convince you I'm not--

26:00.791 --> 26:01.791
A monster.

26:05.000 --> 26:05.875
Are you?

26:08.208 --> 26:09.250
How am I to know?

26:09.958 --> 26:12.583
When I cut my finger, I bleed.
That's human, right?

26:13.375 --> 26:15.041
When I overeat, my stomach aches.

26:15.125 --> 26:16.875
When I'm happy, I laugh.

26:16.958 --> 26:19.541
When I'm upset, I swear.
And when I hate someone...

26:19.625 --> 26:21.875
for stealing my whole life from me,
I kill him.

26:23.000 --> 26:24.041
Hm.

26:25.333 --> 26:27.041
People call you a monster too.

26:27.708 --> 26:28.875
A mutant.

26:28.958 --> 26:30.375
What if they come after you?

26:31.250 --> 26:32.125
Attack you?

26:32.541 --> 26:33.541
They have.

26:35.500 --> 26:37.791
Why not kill them?

26:37.875 --> 26:38.708
Because then...

26:42.375 --> 26:44.291
I am what they say I am.

26:49.500 --> 26:51.125
If I tell you, Witcher,

26:52.125 --> 26:55.708
that I can neither forgive Stregobor
nor renounce my revenge,

26:56.916 --> 26:57.916
is that it?

26:59.500 --> 27:00.875
I admit I'm a monster?

27:01.958 --> 27:02.833
Yes.

27:04.208 --> 27:05.041
Or...

27:05.708 --> 27:07.250
you can leave Blaviken...

27:08.583 --> 27:09.958
and finally live.

27:15.458 --> 27:16.791
You choose, Princess.

27:44.250 --> 27:46.250
Keep it steady!

27:54.583 --> 27:55.541
Steady!

27:57.416 --> 27:59.541
Stand by!

28:35.041 --> 28:36.750
Hold...

28:36.833 --> 28:40.958
Charge!

28:57.041 --> 28:59.083
Not fair that I'm trapped here.

28:59.166 --> 29:01.500
I could magically put you to sleep,
Princess.

29:03.666 --> 29:04.750
Just an idea.

29:04.833 --> 29:07.666
-It's been two days.
-For you and everyone else in the castle.

29:07.750 --> 29:10.083
The King and Queen ordered us
to remain here,

29:11.916 --> 29:13.375
and that's what we shall do.

29:16.625 --> 29:17.958
And why are you not there?

29:19.125 --> 29:20.333
Wherever they are.

29:21.333 --> 29:22.666
My duty is to protect you.

29:22.750 --> 29:24.416
You're resentful of that burden.

29:24.500 --> 29:25.916
It's the greatest honor of my life.

29:28.000 --> 29:30.416
You are both incredibly boring.

29:40.083 --> 29:41.541
Many, many years ago,

29:41.625 --> 29:44.791
sorcerers were known
to lock little girls in towers.

29:45.541 --> 29:47.250
I'm beginning to understand why.

29:47.333 --> 29:49.541
You know cautionary tales don't work
on me.

29:50.458 --> 29:52.125
The girls were said to be cursed.

29:52.208 --> 29:54.750
They were said to announce
the end of the human race.

29:54.833 --> 29:55.791
Ooh.

29:57.041 --> 30:00.000
So they were systematically killed.

30:00.083 --> 30:01.083
The end.

30:21.291 --> 30:22.750
Will my grandmother be all right?

30:33.333 --> 30:35.333
You will be all right, Princess.

30:36.333 --> 30:37.833
You are her blood.

30:40.875 --> 30:43.333
And the apple never falls far
from the tree.

31:10.750 --> 31:11.833
We're losing!

31:19.208 --> 31:21.666
The ships from Skellige?

31:21.750 --> 31:23.625
There's been a storm, Your Majesty.

31:25.125 --> 31:26.041
No one's coming!

31:27.083 --> 31:30.166
Then we fight alone.
We cannot surrender Cintra!

31:30.250 --> 31:31.250
Nor will we!

31:46.291 --> 31:47.250
Eist!

32:06.375 --> 32:07.541
Move!

32:10.916 --> 32:12.458
No!

32:15.708 --> 32:20.166
Guide us to the safety
of your arms, hold us in your light,

32:20.666 --> 32:24.708
protect us from the imperial darkness
that threatens our souls.

32:30.583 --> 32:31.750
Princess Cirilla...

32:32.416 --> 32:33.458
Hm.

32:37.625 --> 32:39.250
- Are we going to be okay?

32:39.333 --> 32:42.708
Don't worry, Martin.
The Queen will defeat Nilfgaard.

32:43.625 --> 32:44.875
We will go home soon.

32:51.875 --> 32:53.041
Your Highness.

32:56.666 --> 32:58.750
...won't stop
until they get what they want!

32:58.833 --> 33:01.250
...a hundred arrows
on my body first!

33:01.333 --> 33:03.125
Your Majesty, what must...

33:22.041 --> 33:23.458
My sweet child.

33:28.083 --> 33:29.083
Careful.

33:31.083 --> 33:32.041
Careful.

33:37.333 --> 33:39.416
-Cintra is under attack.

33:44.041 --> 33:45.250
Eist is dead.

33:52.750 --> 33:55.125
Nilfgaard have made their way
into the city.

33:55.791 --> 33:56.875
Why?

34:00.000 --> 34:01.166
The citizens...

34:01.916 --> 34:04.375
how many of them are safe
within our walls?

34:04.750 --> 34:07.958
A hundred or so, Your Majesty.
The guests from the banquet.

34:10.250 --> 34:11.375
The supplies...

34:12.500 --> 34:13.791
check we have enough.

34:16.750 --> 34:17.583
Aye.

34:26.041 --> 34:27.750
You've been brave, my child,

34:29.375 --> 34:30.500
while I've been gone?

34:30.583 --> 34:32.708
I haven't. Ask Mousesack.
I've been impatient.

34:32.791 --> 34:35.333
You will rule this land someday.

34:36.625 --> 34:38.750
You know that, don't you?

34:41.833 --> 34:43.375
Why are you saying all this?

34:47.458 --> 34:48.708
Are you dying?

34:51.458 --> 34:52.625
My sweet child,

34:55.125 --> 34:58.458
when I go,
it will be far more dramatic than this.

35:12.916 --> 35:14.125
Now, child...

35:18.125 --> 35:19.333
let me rest.

35:19.958 --> 35:21.041
Hm?

35:53.750 --> 35:55.333
They've reached the gate.

36:08.958 --> 36:10.000
What are you doing?

36:20.250 --> 36:21.500
How long will it hold?

36:23.250 --> 36:24.916
As long as I hold.

36:37.333 --> 36:39.458
You know what Vesemir would say.

36:39.916 --> 36:42.833
"Witchers shouldn't play
at being white knights.

36:42.916 --> 36:45.125
We shouldn't try and uphold the law.

36:46.750 --> 36:48.166
We don't show off.

36:48.666 --> 36:50.416
We get paid in coin."

36:52.833 --> 36:53.708
And he's right.

36:57.708 --> 36:58.666
Hm.

36:59.458 --> 37:01.291
Want to hear about my first monster?

37:03.208 --> 37:05.333
Wasn't 50 miles outside of Kaer Morhen.

37:07.291 --> 37:08.500
He was huge.

37:09.375 --> 37:11.250
-Stinking.

37:11.333 --> 37:12.833
-Bald head.

37:12.916 --> 37:14.083
-Rotten teeth.

37:16.791 --> 37:18.625
He pulled that girl from the cart,

37:19.458 --> 37:22.083
tore her dress off
in front of her father and said,

37:22.875 --> 37:24.458
"It's time you met a real man."

37:26.666 --> 37:28.500
I told him it was time he met one too.

37:31.625 --> 37:33.291
It took two strikes to kill him.

37:34.833 --> 37:35.875
They weren't clean.

37:36.916 --> 37:38.375
But they were spectacular.

37:40.625 --> 37:42.583
I turned to that girl afterwards.

37:42.666 --> 37:44.500
She was drenched in the man's blood.

37:46.333 --> 37:47.583
She took one look at me,

37:48.458 --> 37:50.583
screamed, vomited,

37:51.333 --> 37:52.416
and passed out.

37:54.958 --> 37:55.791
Yeah.

37:57.375 --> 37:59.500
-I thought the world needed me too.

38:03.833 --> 38:05.541
Who were you talking to?

38:11.333 --> 38:12.458
I talk to my horse.

38:14.208 --> 38:15.916
-That's sad.
-Is it?

38:20.333 --> 38:21.416
Tell me, Witcher.

38:22.916 --> 38:24.500
You don't believe in destiny

38:25.041 --> 38:26.250
or the lesser evil.

38:28.208 --> 38:29.416
What do you believe in?

38:29.500 --> 38:30.500
You mean...

38:31.125 --> 38:32.541
who do I believe.

38:33.083 --> 38:34.250
I don't pick sides.

38:34.666 --> 38:35.958
You just kill monsters.

39:02.166 --> 39:03.416
I've made my decision.

39:05.791 --> 39:09.166
You gave me an ultimatum
and I find they work.

39:12.125 --> 39:13.458
Tomorrow, I'll leave Blaviken.

39:14.875 --> 39:15.875
For good.

39:24.041 --> 39:25.625
My men, they love me
and I love them.

39:27.000 --> 39:30.041
But it's been a long time
since someone saw me.

39:35.625 --> 39:36.750
When I was a girl,

39:38.041 --> 39:40.458
my mother used to run her fingers...

39:41.041 --> 39:42.500
over my forehead.

39:44.541 --> 39:45.916
She'd say...

39:46.625 --> 39:48.833
she'd give a lovely lintar...

39:50.125 --> 39:52.958
to know the thoughts
going around in there.

40:43.416 --> 40:45.625
Fire at will! Fire!

40:45.708 --> 40:47.375
Bring more fire!

41:11.458 --> 41:14.916
Your Majesty, the Nilfgaardians
will breach the castle gates.

41:15.000 --> 41:16.000
Have breached.

41:17.416 --> 41:19.958
My powers could not hold them any longer,
Your Majesty.

41:20.041 --> 41:21.750
Now what? What do we do?

41:22.333 --> 41:23.166
Mousesack.

41:27.916 --> 41:29.791
He's in the gatekeep.

41:31.875 --> 41:34.958
Destiny may yet side with us.

41:41.750 --> 41:42.583
Danek.

41:46.541 --> 41:47.541
It's time.

41:50.125 --> 41:51.250
What?

41:53.625 --> 41:55.000
Wait, where are you going?

41:59.916 --> 42:01.125
Come here, child.

42:14.625 --> 42:16.250
The gates are down!

42:17.875 --> 42:19.125
Lesson number two.

42:21.500 --> 42:24.208
Know when it's time to stop moving.

42:25.500 --> 42:26.500
You're conceding.

42:28.083 --> 42:30.000
Nilfgaard takes no prisoners.

42:31.625 --> 42:35.250
Which means that right now,
my citizens are being tortured.

42:38.958 --> 42:43.416
Their insides are being pulled
to their outsides while they watch.

42:46.500 --> 42:48.416
Their legs lit on fire.

42:49.041 --> 42:51.500
Their tongues fed to the dogs.

42:55.958 --> 42:56.958
Your Majesty.

42:57.416 --> 42:58.666
-He's gone.
-What?

43:02.958 --> 43:04.833
In the face of the inevitable, Cirilla,

43:06.333 --> 43:09.583
good leaders should always choose mercy.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.583
In the future,
you will be wise to do the same.

43:16.083 --> 43:17.000
Lazlo,

43:18.000 --> 43:18.916
bring her cloak.

43:20.416 --> 43:21.708
What? No.

43:22.416 --> 43:24.458
Continue to be brave. Promise me.

43:25.208 --> 43:27.041
You are the Lion Cub of Cintra.

43:27.791 --> 43:30.791
-You are destined for great things.
-I can't do this without you.

43:30.875 --> 43:31.958
We must go, Your Highness.

43:32.041 --> 43:34.500
- No!

43:41.791 --> 43:42.708
Go.

43:44.375 --> 43:45.666
The world depends on it.

43:58.166 --> 43:59.291
I love you.

44:05.208 --> 44:07.500
Find Geralt of Rivia.

44:09.333 --> 44:10.833
He is your destiny.

44:37.833 --> 44:38.708
Your Majesty.

44:38.791 --> 44:39.791
I saw it too.

44:42.750 --> 44:44.125
It is why they came.

44:45.250 --> 44:46.416
I will deliver her.

44:49.000 --> 44:50.500
I give you my word.

44:57.958 --> 44:58.833
Mousesack.

45:02.166 --> 45:03.375
Your service...

45:04.375 --> 45:06.583
has been an honor to us all.

45:08.666 --> 45:09.833
As has yours.

45:13.125 --> 45:14.500
Your Majesty.

45:33.125 --> 45:35.500
I'm sorry to disturb, my lady.
It is time.

45:36.208 --> 45:37.250
Nilfgaard is nigh.

45:51.708 --> 45:52.708
It is time.

46:19.041 --> 46:20.125
We can leave.

46:21.500 --> 46:23.041
We can find a way out.

46:24.625 --> 46:25.583
This...

46:27.500 --> 46:28.833
This is our way out.

47:09.791 --> 47:11.250
-What are you doing?
-It's me, my son.

47:11.333 --> 47:13.333
-What is this?
-It's okay.

48:29.333 --> 48:30.416
Horses.

48:31.916 --> 48:32.916
Princess, come.

48:34.083 --> 48:34.916
Hey!

48:36.875 --> 48:38.500
-Keep going.
-No!

48:39.500 --> 48:42.125
Princess, I gave your grandmother my word.

48:42.833 --> 48:44.041
Allow me to keep it.

48:45.208 --> 48:46.041
Go.

48:47.916 --> 48:49.708
My grandmother said I had to leave.

48:49.791 --> 48:51.958
Why? Why is Nilfgaard here?

48:52.041 --> 48:54.541
-Why does the world depend on it?
-Hold on, Your Highness.

49:00.500 --> 49:01.833
-Hyah!

49:09.708 --> 49:11.416
We're getting close to the gate.

49:13.041 --> 49:15.083
I've been protected my whole life,
Lazlo.

49:15.166 --> 49:16.083
Why?

49:59.666 --> 50:02.416
<i>You were in the market.</i>
<i>Covered in blood.</i>

50:05.583 --> 50:07.833
<i>You say you can't choose,</i>
<i>but you had to.</i>

50:08.291 --> 50:10.250
<i>And you'll never know</i>
<i>if you were right.</i>

50:15.375 --> 50:17.000
<i>Your reward will be a stoning.</i>

50:18.333 --> 50:19.625
<i>And you will run.</i>

50:20.375 --> 50:23.333
<i>You will try to outrun the girl</i>
<i>in the woods, but you cannot.</i>

50:24.083 --> 50:25.583
<i>-She is your destiny.</i>
-Renfri!

50:35.916 --> 50:37.000
The market.

50:49.791 --> 50:50.958
She knew you'd come.

50:53.750 --> 50:55.083
Where's Renfri?

50:55.166 --> 50:57.416
She's at the tower
with your little friend,

50:58.208 --> 50:59.166
Marilka.

50:59.750 --> 51:01.958
She gave us a message
to pass on to you.

51:02.416 --> 51:04.166
You have to choose the lesser evil.

51:04.250 --> 51:05.666
It's an ultimatum.

51:06.750 --> 51:07.666
Get it?

51:11.000 --> 51:11.875
Fuck.

51:11.958 --> 51:13.083
Hm.

51:30.916 --> 51:31.833
Witcher!

52:08.250 --> 52:09.083
Geralt!

52:09.708 --> 52:11.041
Geralt!

52:13.666 --> 52:14.500
No!

52:24.458 --> 52:26.500
-You chose.
-Let the girl go.

52:30.416 --> 52:31.541
I will kill her.

52:33.666 --> 52:36.708
I will kill everyone here
until Stregobor comes down.

52:37.916 --> 52:38.958
Leave Blaviken.

52:40.708 --> 52:41.833
It's not too late.

52:42.666 --> 52:44.000
Magic doesn't work on me.

52:45.625 --> 52:46.916
Silver does, though.

52:47.000 --> 52:48.333
Silver is for monsters.

52:52.375 --> 52:55.000
-If we cross swords...
-I won't be able to stop.

53:07.250 --> 53:09.583
They created me just as they created you.

53:10.000 --> 53:11.458
We're not so different.

54:28.041 --> 54:30.958
The girl in the woods will be
with you always.

54:32.750 --> 54:34.000
She is your destiny.

55:16.500 --> 55:18.500
Get-- get back here, you little--

55:48.250 --> 55:50.083
No. No!

56:26.833 --> 56:28.041
Incredible.

56:33.541 --> 56:34.375
Marilka.

56:35.708 --> 56:38.083
Marilka? Marilka!

56:38.916 --> 56:40.166
Get me a cart.

56:40.250 --> 56:42.458
We'll take her to the tower
for an autopsy.

56:44.500 --> 56:46.708
If you touch a single hair on her head...

56:47.583 --> 56:49.250
yours will be on the ground next.

56:49.333 --> 56:50.541
Have you gone mad?

56:51.458 --> 56:52.541
Her mutation,

56:53.458 --> 56:54.708
it influences people.

56:54.791 --> 56:56.916
That's how she got these men
to follow her.

56:57.333 --> 56:58.583
We need to take it.

57:02.666 --> 57:05.333
She got to you too, didn't she?

57:07.333 --> 57:08.333
Do not...

57:08.916 --> 57:10.041
touch her.

57:13.500 --> 57:14.541
Witcher.

57:16.125 --> 57:19.666
You butchered bodies
in the streets of Blaviken.

57:19.750 --> 57:21.958
-You're a beast!
-You endangered the girl.

57:22.041 --> 57:23.958
- Beast!
- He's killed every single...

57:24.041 --> 57:27.416
-You took the law into your own hands.
- Bastard!

57:27.500 --> 57:29.416
- He's a bad one!

57:29.500 --> 57:31.500
- Get out of here!
- Get out and don't...

57:31.583 --> 57:33.625
Go on! Butcher!

57:33.708 --> 57:35.291
You made a choice.

57:36.958 --> 57:39.583
And you'll never know
if it was the right one.

57:39.666 --> 57:41.333
-Die, Witcher!

57:44.583 --> 57:45.958
Die, Witcher!

57:57.000 --> 57:58.666
-Go, Witcher!
-Die!

58:01.375 --> 58:03.041
Get out of Blaviken, Geralt.

58:05.541 --> 58:06.750
Don't ever come back.

58:08.416 --> 58:09.625
Bastard!

58:36.625 --> 58:39.333
<i>The girl in the woods will be</i>
<i>with you always.</i>

58:41.125 --> 58:42.458
<i>She is your destiny.</i>
