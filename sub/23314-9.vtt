WEBVTT

00:00.138 --> 00:01.076
Previously, on Black Lightning...

00:01.077 --> 00:03.060
You went too far this time.

00:03.060 --> 00:04.852
And our search for Black Lightning

00:04.853 --> 00:07.014
has expanded to include
another five officers.

00:07.014 --> 00:09.989
This act of trying to frame me, I'm
guessing it's about green light.

00:09.989 --> 00:12.035
And we are getting close
to shutting it down.

00:12.035 --> 00:13.068
Yo, Henderson.

00:13.068 --> 00:15.010
Hampton woods,
you'll find a shallow grave,

00:15.010 --> 00:17.051
and the weapon that
actually killed Lady Eve.

00:17.051 --> 00:19.035
Something weird is 
definitely going on.

00:20.060 --> 00:23.989
I did that. 
With my hands.

00:23.989 --> 00:27.039
When Black Lightning returned, you said
you would take care of him. You didn't.

00:27.039 --> 00:29.043
I'm bringing ASA
operatives to kill him.

00:29.043 --> 00:32.014
That sample Anissa brought over
from your father's investigation,

00:32.014 --> 00:34.006
it's a vaccine.

00:34.006 --> 00:36.031
Components of the vaccine are the same
active ingredients in green light.

00:36.031 --> 00:39.031
Are you saying someone's been working
on green light for 30 years?

00:39.031 --> 00:42.039
You moved here around the time
the vaccine came to freeland.

00:42.039 --> 00:45.043
When I realized that the Asa's
vaccine was killing children,

00:45.043 --> 00:47.043
I leaked the information 
to your father,

00:47.043 --> 00:49.081
and his investigation 
got him killed.

00:55.068 --> 00:58.081
All these years,
I've kept secrets from you.

00:58.081 --> 01:01.081
I leaked the information 
to your father,

01:01.081 --> 01:04.989
and his investigation 
got him killed.

01:04.989 --> 01:08.001
My father was murdered.

01:08.001 --> 01:12.081
Martin proctor, the head of the ASA
for this area, is looking for you.

01:12.081 --> 01:16.035
If you use your powers or you go
out in the suit, he will find you,

01:16.035 --> 01:17.993
and they will kill you.

01:17.993 --> 01:21.010
And they will find Anissa,
and they will kill her, too.

01:21.010 --> 01:24.051
I'm sorry, Jefferson, but you have
to stop being Black Lightning.

01:26.000 --> 01:32.074

== Synced & corrected by <font color="#00FFFF">MaxPayne</font> ==

01:49.081 --> 01:52.010
Yeah?

01:52.010 --> 01:53.081
Man, I thought you and I were supposed
to shoot straight with each other.

01:56.056 --> 01:58.989
When have I ever shot crooked?

01:58.989 --> 02:03.056
Yeah, I gave you a lead that would
help find Lady Eve's real killer.

02:03.056 --> 02:05.006
And I passed that lead along.

02:05.006 --> 02:07.085
Then why did some fool
destroy the evidence

02:07.085 --> 02:09.038
instead of collecting it?

02:10.060 --> 02:12.039
I don't know what
you want me to say.

02:14.006 --> 02:15.010
Yo...

02:16.072 --> 02:20.047
Yo, you strike me as a good man.

02:21.039 --> 02:23.001
A good man who knows

02:23.001 --> 02:25.989
that a lot of the men
he's working with ain't.

02:25.989 --> 02:27.081
You know, it's so easy
for someone like you.

02:27.081 --> 02:31.027
There's no rules.
No one to answer to.

02:31.027 --> 02:36.085
Yeah, well...
it ain't always easy, brother.

02:36.085 --> 02:39.043
But neither one of us
signed up for easy.

02:39.043 --> 02:43.085
Now, this green light, it's destroying
everything and everyone in its path.

02:44.047 --> 02:46.010
I know.

02:46.010 --> 02:49.027
So there's a connect between
the jokers behind green light

02:49.027 --> 02:54.006
and somebody who's more dangerous to
freeland than you could possibly imagine.

02:55.047 --> 02:57.027
Now, I ain't going to sit around,

02:57.027 --> 03:01.010
and watch something worse than
crack destroy another generation.

03:03.001 --> 03:05.035
Now, I'm going to take out 
green light.

03:06.047 --> 03:08.043
And if I have to do it alone...

03:09.014 --> 03:10.997
So be it.

03:10.997 --> 03:13.014
What do you need from me?

03:16.039 --> 03:18.018
Well, you know 
I didn't kill Lady Eve.

03:19.022 --> 03:20.997
Yeah. You were set up.

03:22.047 --> 03:23.072
Do you know who it was?

03:23.072 --> 03:25.989
Yeah, I've got some leads.

03:25.989 --> 03:29.997
But you and I both know there are dudes
in your department looking the other way.

03:29.997 --> 03:31.014
Hmm.

03:35.060 --> 03:38.031
I've got some vacation
days stored up.

03:38.031 --> 03:40.064
I'll use them to do
some investigating.

03:40.064 --> 03:43.043
Just do me one favor.

03:44.081 --> 03:46.018
And, what's that?

03:47.993 --> 03:51.006
If I end up dead in
some alley somewhere,

03:52.014 --> 03:53.085
and they say I was dirty,

03:55.043 --> 03:59.993
make sure my wife and my
family know the truth.

04:03.997 --> 04:06.006
I'm not gonna let that happen.

04:22.067 --> 04:24.014
Hey, what's wrong?

04:25.018 --> 04:26.060
I don't know.

04:27.989 --> 04:29.072
Okay. Well, can I help?

04:29.072 --> 04:31.039
Not unless you have some Prozac.

04:32.039 --> 04:35.014
Prozac? Stop. Prozac for what?

04:38.001 --> 04:41.064
I don't know, Anissa. I just
feel like I'm going crazy.

04:41.064 --> 04:44.006
That thing with the phone,
it couldn't have been real.

04:44.006 --> 04:46.018
But it felt real, so...

04:47.997 --> 04:49.047
I think there's something
wrong with me.

04:50.051 --> 04:52.027
Maybe I'm smoking too much weed.

04:52.027 --> 04:53.068
No, it's not. 
You're not going crazy.

04:53.068 --> 04:55.989
Though, you do need to stop that.

04:55.989 --> 04:57.085
Okay?

04:57.085 --> 04:59.993
Look, I knew 
you weren't going crazy

04:59.993 --> 05:02.989
when you first told me
about the phone, and...

05:04.056 --> 05:06.039
I should've said something, 
and I didn't,

05:06.039 --> 05:07.993
and I'm saying it now.

05:07.993 --> 05:09.993
What are you sayin'?

05:09.993 --> 05:11.993
The reason I know you're not crazy is
because I thought I was going crazy...

05:11.993 --> 05:13.051
Well, you are crazy.

05:13.051 --> 05:15.022
Stop playing right now.

05:15.022 --> 05:17.043
I didn't catch anything on fire,
but do you remember the sink?

05:17.043 --> 05:20.014
- You remember how I broke it?
- So?

05:23.006 --> 05:24.035
I have powers.

05:24.035 --> 05:27.022
And it sounds like 
you probably do, too.

05:30.068 --> 05:32.993
- "Powers"?
- Yes.

05:36.077 --> 05:38.060
Anissa, what do you mean, 
"powers"?

05:45.077 --> 05:47.085
I mean, I have superpowers.

05:52.072 --> 05:54.010
Look, I'm thunder.

05:55.997 --> 05:57.989
All right.

05:57.989 --> 06:00.077
Okay, look. Jennifer, I know
this is a lot for you right now.

06:00.077 --> 06:01.997
- You're messing with me.
- I understand.

06:01.997 --> 06:03.047
- I'm not in the mood.
- I understand.

06:03.047 --> 06:04.081
- I'm not screwing with you.
- You're upsetting my mood

06:04.081 --> 06:05.085
so I'm going back to bed.

06:05.085 --> 06:08.056
Jennifer! I'm not messing with you!

06:08.056 --> 06:10.014
- Stop!
- You stop!

06:10.014 --> 06:14.001
Okay, fine.
I'll show you I'm thunder.

06:17.081 --> 06:20.014
Oh, my god!

06:20.997 --> 06:22.010
Oh, my god! Put me down!

06:22.010 --> 06:27.039
Put me down! Put me down! 
Put me down!

06:27.039 --> 06:28.997
- Oh, my god! Oh, my god!
- See, you're not crazy.

06:28.997 --> 06:32.010
Listen, we're just like dad.

06:32.010 --> 06:34.014
- Dad?
- Yes. He has powers, too.

06:34.014 --> 06:35.085
He's Black Lightning.

06:38.035 --> 06:40.060
Come here.

06:40.060 --> 06:42.001
- Get away from me.
- Listen to me.

06:42.001 --> 06:44.018
- Stay away from me!
- Would you listen to me?

06:44.018 --> 06:45.060
- What's going on?
- Dad!

06:47.085 --> 06:49.056
Dad, Anissa said...

06:49.056 --> 06:52.051
Well, she just lifted up my bed
and said you're Black Lightning

06:52.051 --> 06:53.993
and she...

06:53.993 --> 06:56.031
Well, we have powers!

07:03.997 --> 07:05.031
Oh, my god.

07:08.006 --> 07:10.018
- Oh, my god.
- Look, honey, honey, let me explain...

07:10.018 --> 07:12.068
"Explain"? How you've been
lying to me my whole life?

07:17.051 --> 07:19.056
- You said I could trust you.
- And you can.

07:19.056 --> 07:22.989
Is that supposed to be a joke?
Why should I believe anything you say?

07:22.989 --> 07:24.022
Jen, come here.

07:28.047 --> 07:29.043
Really?

07:40.068 --> 07:44.047
- What were you thinking?
- What was I supposed to do?

07:44.047 --> 07:47.006
Just let her think she was going crazy?
She needed to know.

07:47.006 --> 07:49.039
Well, that was not
your decision to make.

07:49.039 --> 07:52.064
I am the only one in this family who
knows exactly what she's going through.

07:52.064 --> 07:55.072
No, I think I have 
a pretty good idea.

07:55.072 --> 07:59.027
Oh, really? What major lies did
your parents tell you, dad?

07:59.027 --> 08:01.027
Hey.

08:01.027 --> 08:05.006
Your father and I
never lied to you.

08:05.006 --> 08:07.085
We may have withheld certain pieces
of information to protect you,

08:07.085 --> 08:09.993
but that is what parents do.

08:09.993 --> 08:11.993
Santa claus, the tooth fairy.

08:11.993 --> 08:16.001
Half of being a parent is protecting
your kids, so they can stay kids.

08:16.001 --> 08:17.085
Well, we're not kids anymore.

08:17.085 --> 08:20.039
Listen, even when I am in a nursing
home, I will still be your mother,

08:20.039 --> 08:22.051
and he will still be your father.

08:22.051 --> 08:25.993
What you did,
talking to my child...

08:25.993 --> 08:27.072
Our child.

08:27.072 --> 08:29.077
Our child, about something so
serious, without consulting me first,

08:29.077 --> 08:33.056
not only was it reckless, Anissa,
it was extremely disrespectful.

08:33.056 --> 08:34.047
Okay.

08:38.022 --> 08:40.006
I'm sorry.

08:40.006 --> 08:44.063
You know I would never do anything
to intentionally disrespect you.

08:44.063 --> 08:48.014
Yes, it was wrong,
but I felt like I owed it to her.

08:48.064 --> 08:50.060
Okay...

08:50.060 --> 08:53.022
Well, we're here now, so...

08:53.022 --> 08:55.997
We just have to help her get
through this the best we can.

08:55.997 --> 08:59.060
Mom, she will be all right.
Look at me, I survived.

08:59.060 --> 09:03.072
Jennifer is not the only one
I am worried about, here, Anissa.

09:03.072 --> 09:05.056
Have you forgotten your father,

09:05.056 --> 09:08.064
Black Lightning, is being framed
for a crime he didn't commit?

09:08.064 --> 09:10.993
And that there are people out
there looking to kill him?

09:10.993 --> 09:13.989
And both of you are in
danger, and now this? This?

09:13.989 --> 09:15.993
Mom, mom, mom, I'm sorry.

09:23.018 --> 09:25.010
Hey.

09:25.010 --> 09:28.043
I will never let anything happen to 
those girls. You know that, right?

09:30.018 --> 09:32.035
Is that a promise
you can really make?

09:34.031 --> 09:38.068
You know I will lay down my life for them.
For all three of you.

09:38.068 --> 09:40.018
You really think the thought of you

09:40.018 --> 09:43.027
having to lay your life down
makes me feel any better?

09:54.085 --> 09:56.068
Maybe Anissa was right.

09:58.047 --> 10:00.064
Maybe we could've done 
things differently.

10:06.039 --> 10:11.035
Yeah. We could've been better.
At all of this.

10:14.006 --> 10:15.051
Hey. Hey.

10:17.989 --> 10:19.056
Even with all of our mistakes...

10:22.014 --> 10:24.056
At least they'll have a chance...

10:24.056 --> 10:27.085
To be a little better at
this with our grandkids.

10:36.068 --> 10:41.056
I mean, Black Lightning has always
been accused of wrongdoing.

10:41.056 --> 10:44.056
But, I can't let someone
trying to frame me,

10:44.056 --> 10:46.043
distract me from my mission.

10:46.043 --> 10:49.993
No, that's what they want.
They can't have it.

10:49.993 --> 10:52.035
No, they can't, so how are
we going to stop them?

10:56.626 --> 10:58.609
Go after green light.

10:58.609 --> 11:00.514
Where do we start?

11:00.515 --> 11:02.544
Okay, we know there's a
connection between green light

11:02.544 --> 11:05.481
and the vaccine that my
father was looking into.

11:05.481 --> 11:06.515
Lynn, you proved that.

11:07.548 --> 11:09.523
So, if we could just pinpoint who,

11:09.523 --> 11:12.498
or what is at the heart of 
that connection,

11:12.498 --> 11:15.527
we can kill two birds 
with one stone.

11:15.527 --> 11:19.515
Take down green light and take
on who's ever behind this.

11:19.515 --> 11:21.498
Okay, so, is uncle gambi going
to be helping us? Because...

11:21.498 --> 11:23.498
No. No. No!

11:23.498 --> 11:26.510
- What?
- He can't be trusted with this.

11:26.510 --> 11:31.481
Okay, now, my father was clearly
getting close to something.

11:32.498 --> 11:34.552
I mean, that's why he was killed.

11:36.498 --> 11:37.527
So we start there.

11:37.527 --> 11:39.477
Okay.

11:39.477 --> 11:41.477
Besides the powder,
what else was in his file?

11:44.519 --> 11:45.527
Research...

11:46.565 --> 11:49.510
And a reference to a bribery case,

11:49.766 --> 11:50.821
and a politician.

11:52.064 --> 11:53.068
Tobias whale?

11:54.997 --> 11:56.064
- Yes.
- Good.

11:57.047 --> 11:58.077
Okay.

11:59.804 --> 12:02.737
Tomorrow, I need to get my
hands on those court records.

12:02.821 --> 12:04.804
Okay. I'll go with you.

12:04.804 --> 12:08.745
Wait, no. Your sister needs you now.
Stay here and keep an eye on her.

12:08.745 --> 12:09.771
Okay, look...

12:09.771 --> 12:12.737
I know the both of you
are worried about me,

12:12.737 --> 12:14.741
but we have two options.

12:14.741 --> 12:17.812
We could pretend that I'm going to lay
low and make me sneak behind your backs,

12:17.812 --> 12:20.737
or you let me help.

12:31.787 --> 12:32.812
Just be safe.

12:35.829 --> 12:37.754
Both of you.

12:38.766 --> 12:39.758
We will.

12:53.791 --> 12:54.816
Can I come in?

13:04.766 --> 13:06.741
I know exactly what
you're going through.

13:11.762 --> 13:14.750
Well, not unless you came in
here to tell me you're ViXen.

13:16.733 --> 13:17.750
You didn't, right?

13:17.804 --> 13:19.771
Busted.

13:19.771 --> 13:21.816
No. I'm kidding.

13:21.816 --> 13:24.750
- It's not funny.
- I'm sorry.

13:24.750 --> 13:28.758
No, I'm not ViXen.
Or Supergirl.

13:29.771 --> 13:31.791
Just mom.

13:31.791 --> 13:35.745
And you're right.

13:35.745 --> 13:37.771
I can't know what
you're going through.

13:37.771 --> 13:42.737
But I can be here for you, 
and I am.

13:42.737 --> 13:44.829
So when you're ready to talk,
you know where to find me, okay?

13:52.812 --> 13:53.812
Hey.

13:56.750 --> 13:57.779
I love you.

14:30.477 --> 14:31.494
What is it?

14:32.481 --> 14:33.485
This.

14:37.515 --> 14:38.552
Bendscorp.

14:39.569 --> 14:41.485
What about them?

14:42.502 --> 14:44.481
Well, look,

14:44.481 --> 14:47.485
they're making monthly
payments to onshore inc.

14:47.485 --> 14:49.502
- You see that?
- Yes.

14:49.502 --> 14:50.573
Okay, dad, there, uh...

14:50.573 --> 14:55.519
There was a check from bendscorp
made out to grandpa in his files.

14:56.548 --> 14:58.569
- Are you sure?
- Positive.

14:58.569 --> 15:02.556
And I only remember because it
wasn't a small amount of money.

15:02.556 --> 15:04.556
And the name of the
corporation was circled,

15:04.556 --> 15:08.489
and gtc was written in big
letters on the check.

15:10.477 --> 15:11.573
What?

15:11.573 --> 15:15.560
Okay, well, instead of saying,
uh, "gotcha,"

15:15.560 --> 15:17.548
my father would say, "gtc."

15:17.548 --> 15:20.477
Now, I don't know.
He thought it was funny.

15:20.477 --> 15:22.489
Hmm.

15:22.489 --> 15:24.544
- Okay, so, bendscorp, whatever it is...
- Right.

15:24.544 --> 15:26.560
Tried to bribe your
grandfather to kill the story

15:26.560 --> 15:29.556
about what they were doing
to the people of freeland.

15:29.556 --> 15:33.539
But the check was the corroboration
he wanted to run his story.

15:33.539 --> 15:35.548
All right. 
So, what now?

15:35.548 --> 15:40.510
Well, we need to find out about who
was behind incorporating bendscorp.

15:40.510 --> 15:43.494
Those records are public. Should
be filed here with the state.

15:43.494 --> 15:44.544
All right. 
I'll be back.

15:44.544 --> 15:46.510
- We're close.
- Yup.

15:46.510 --> 15:47.523
Close.

16:01.494 --> 16:03.494
Ow! What the...?

16:03.494 --> 16:05.531
I need to know 
who made a directed-energy weapon

16:05.531 --> 16:08.502
that mimics the powers of Black
Lightning, and could frame him.

16:08.502 --> 16:11.481
Peter, what did you give me?

16:11.481 --> 16:14.531
In Africa, they refer to the black
mamba venom as the kiss of death.

16:14.531 --> 16:16.489
You just got a neck full of it.

16:16.489 --> 16:21.510
Now, I happen to have some
anti-venom right here.

16:21.510 --> 16:23.544
So it seems that 
I have something you want.

16:23.544 --> 16:26.477
You got something I want.

16:26.477 --> 16:29.489
- I have a family.
- Me, too.

16:30.548 --> 16:33.481
Hey, it's a fast-acting poison, man.
We ain't got all day.

16:33.569 --> 16:36.523
I only have a name.

16:36.523 --> 16:39.498
Write it down.
And how to find him.

16:53.552 --> 16:56.502
Follow the instructions, 
you'll be fine.

16:57.498 --> 16:58.565
Give my best to your family.

17:07.973 --> 17:11.983
Dad, you're the one who said it wasn't
safe to use our superhero look,

17:11.983 --> 17:13.023
so I improvised.

17:13.023 --> 17:14.979
Yeah, I just don't know about this.

17:14.979 --> 17:16.965
You look great. Relax.

17:21.032 --> 17:22.949
Yo.

17:23.979 --> 17:25.991
I got questions that need answers.

17:25.991 --> 17:28.962
I'm sorry to hear that, Barack.

17:28.962 --> 17:30.003
That's president Obama.

17:30.003 --> 17:32.983
It's disrespectful to call him
by his first name.

17:32.983 --> 17:35.999
The a to z of bendscorp.
Go.

17:35.999 --> 17:39.941
Okay, um, as a law firm of record,

17:39.941 --> 17:43.941
any information I have on bendscorp is
privileged and therefore I can't give...

17:45.979 --> 17:47.999
what are you doing?
What is she doing?

17:47.999 --> 17:49.037
Well, before coming here,

17:49.037 --> 17:51.999
I pulled your birthday,
your kid's birthday,

17:51.999 --> 17:55.029
your wife's birthday, and all of
your social security numbers.

17:55.029 --> 17:58.024
I even managed to get
your family pet's name,

17:58.024 --> 18:03.970
your wife's maiden name, so I'm
pretty confident that eventually,

18:03.970 --> 18:05.987
I can figure out your passwords.

18:05.987 --> 18:08.020
And, guess what?
I have all night.

18:09.033 --> 18:10.995
But here's the thing...

18:12.029 --> 18:13.953
She's patient.

18:14.003 --> 18:16.003
I ain't.

18:16.003 --> 18:18.020
So while she's typing and hacking...

18:18.020 --> 18:22.974
See, I'm trying to decide
whether I want to...

18:22.974 --> 18:29.966
Rare, medium-rare, or well-done.

18:29.966 --> 18:31.012
You know what?

18:32.033 --> 18:33.974
I think I can help you two out.

18:34.974 --> 18:38.008
Oh, okay.

18:38.008 --> 18:39.974
- There you go.
- Thought you might.

18:41.941 --> 18:44.995
For the record, I voted for you.

18:45.991 --> 18:47.016
Both times.

19:00.958 --> 19:01.966
Hey.

19:07.962 --> 19:11.991
Look, I know you're upset,
but you're lucky.

19:11.991 --> 19:13.987
Lucky?

19:13.987 --> 19:15.962
Yeah.

19:15.962 --> 19:19.029
Look, do you know how I found out
the truth about our special family?

19:20.945 --> 19:22.999
Girl, dad and I got into a fight.

19:22.999 --> 19:26.991
Or rather, Black Lightning and
thunder got into a fight...

19:26.991 --> 19:29.003
- who won?
- That's not important, okay.

19:29.003 --> 19:30.995
Okay, obviously, you didn't.

19:30.995 --> 19:33.024
I still don't know how I feel
about that name, thunder.

19:33.024 --> 19:34.991
Anissa, do you have a point?

19:34.991 --> 19:36.945
Yes, I have a point.

19:37.987 --> 19:40.024
Look...

19:40.024 --> 19:42.970
I'm not gonna lie. I was
freaked out at first, too.

19:42.970 --> 19:45.958
And then I thought about all
the people I could help.

19:45.958 --> 19:49.003
Of course you did, Harriet. But, 
you know, that's not really my thing.

19:49.003 --> 19:51.979
Because the last march I went
to, to try and help people,

19:51.979 --> 19:54.983
my boyfriend's spine got
severed by a bullet.

19:54.983 --> 19:55.983
So, I'm good.

19:56.991 --> 19:58.949
God, I just want to be normal.

19:58.949 --> 20:02.966
Yeah, well, "normal" is overrated.

20:02.966 --> 20:05.949
That's something you hear
in an after-school special.

20:05.949 --> 20:07.966
I'm serious.

20:07.966 --> 20:09.941
Anissa, I don't want to be 
like this.

20:09.941 --> 20:12.016
This is who you are, Jennifer.

20:12.016 --> 20:14.974
This is who we are.

20:14.974 --> 20:17.033
And, listen, you can think
of this as a burden,

20:17.033 --> 20:20.008
or you can think of it as 
a gift, a blessing from god.

20:21.983 --> 20:23.983
Choice is yours.
We are who we are.

20:23.983 --> 20:26.970
But that's the point.
The choice is not ours.

20:26.970 --> 20:28.970
We don't have a choice.

20:28.970 --> 20:30.970
Doesn't that...
you off just a little bit?

20:30.970 --> 20:33.962
Not as much as the thought of 
a woman getting raped or beaten down

20:33.962 --> 20:35.945
because thunder wasn't
there to protect her.

20:39.037 --> 20:40.037
What's that?

20:42.949 --> 20:44.949
Oh, nothing.

20:44.949 --> 20:47.029
What do you mean, it's nothing?
You're watching something.

20:52.941 --> 20:54.987
Well, that thunder...
she is fine!

20:54.987 --> 20:58.016
Look, she can save me any
day of the week, all right?

20:58.016 --> 20:59.037
I mean...

20:59.037 --> 21:01.970
That... though! Right?

21:01.970 --> 21:03.999
Boys, look.
You know what, though?

21:10.958 --> 21:12.999
No, it's not funny. Even
still, saving all these lives,

21:12.999 --> 21:16.008
all guys want to do is talk about my...
like, really?

21:16.008 --> 21:19.941
Well, I just searched "Black Lightning
and thunder" to see what came up, but...

21:22.941 --> 21:25.008
By the way, you know you have
more fans online than dad does?

21:26.966 --> 21:27.987
What? I do?

21:29.941 --> 21:32.941
Someone actually just started
a new fan page about you,

21:32.941 --> 21:34.974
and it doesn't mention your...

21:34.974 --> 21:36.974
It talks about how
you're challenging

21:36.974 --> 21:39.966
the patriarchy's narrative
of female heroes.

21:40.970 --> 21:43.008
Really?

21:45.020 --> 21:46.953
You want me to show you?

21:48.970 --> 21:50.037
Yeah, I kind of do.
Let me see.

21:50.037 --> 21:52.979
Yeah, I know you wanna see.

21:52.979 --> 21:54.979
Let's see what you've been watching.

22:02.962 --> 22:04.003
Who referred you?

22:05.941 --> 22:07.941
Thomas Hidalgo.

22:07.941 --> 22:09.983
It's in regards to special weapons that
are meant to kill Black Lightning.

22:09.983 --> 22:12.945
He's not permitted to refer anyone.

22:12.945 --> 22:15.945
I think you're going to want
to make an exception for me.

22:15.945 --> 22:18.958
You're going to hurt yourself, old man.

22:18.958 --> 22:22.958
I think you should take up another hobby.
Like golf.

22:23.995 --> 22:25.991
I always hated golf, Caleb.

22:25.991 --> 22:27.974
You're thinking of 
hanging up on me,

22:27.974 --> 22:31.987
but that wouldn't be smart since 
I know your full name, Caleb Scott,

22:31.987 --> 22:35.012
also your current address,
1245 Goff Avenue.

22:35.012 --> 22:36.958
I also happen to know

22:36.958 --> 22:38.024
that there's a patrol car
about a block away from you,

22:38.024 --> 22:40.949
and that you have a stash of
unregistered assault weapons

22:40.949 --> 22:41.991
that you're selling on 
the dark web.

22:41.991 --> 22:44.945
- So...
- What do you want?

22:47.029 --> 22:50.979
I just need to know where someone
got a particular weapon.

22:50.979 --> 22:54.953
You give me that name and address,
I lose your name and address.

23:14.524 --> 23:16.545
Detective Cayman.

23:16.545 --> 23:19.515
Let's see what you got for us.

23:19.515 --> 23:22.524
These are the guns that Carter wanted.
The ones to kill Black Lightning.

23:30.486 --> 23:32.465
Yeah, Cayman.
I always knew you were dirty.

23:36.549 --> 23:38.465
This is good.

25:05.959 --> 25:07.971
Let's go! Let's go!

25:07.971 --> 25:09.005
Let's go!

25:09.005 --> 25:12.959
Martin. I've found another one.

25:12.959 --> 25:14.975
Give me some time.
I'll find out where he lives.

25:33.959 --> 25:35.963
- Thanks for coming.
- You said it was an emergency.

25:35.963 --> 25:36.959
It is.

25:40.996 --> 25:44.934
- Your father know you're here?
- No. He said we can't trust you.

25:47.921 --> 25:48.921
That's fair.

25:50.009 --> 25:51.938
So, why'd you come?

25:51.938 --> 25:53.942
Because I wanted to
determine that for myself.

25:54.992 --> 25:56.955
What happened between you two?

25:59.988 --> 26:03.938
I did something very
bad a long time ago.

26:03.938 --> 26:06.996
And there was stuff I should've
told your father before now.

26:06.996 --> 26:09.950
He doesn't trust me because
I held out on him for so long.

26:11.979 --> 26:13.996
I can't blame him.

26:13.996 --> 26:17.996
But I just want to make things
right, not just with him, but...

26:18.988 --> 26:20.934
With your conscience?

26:20.934 --> 26:22.950
But also, because
people are in danger.

26:24.917 --> 26:27.013
I used to work as 
a sort of a scout.

26:27.013 --> 26:29.996
A scout? A scout for who?

26:29.996 --> 26:32.959
For some people
I now know are very bad.

26:32.959 --> 26:35.971
I helped them find
young people with abilities.

26:35.971 --> 26:38.963
You mean, young people
like me with powers?

26:40.013 --> 26:41.917
Yes.

26:43.934 --> 26:46.975
And I just saw the body of one of the
boys that I helped find 30 years ago.

26:46.975 --> 26:47.988
Oh, my god!

26:47.988 --> 26:49.963
Along with several others.

26:49.963 --> 26:52.950
Please. Don't tell
your father just yet.

26:54.984 --> 26:57.942
Listen... Anissa.

26:57.942 --> 27:01.984
I told your father that the people I used
to work for are hunting Black Lightning.

27:01.984 --> 27:04.921
I don't think it's safe for
either of you to be out.

27:04.921 --> 27:07.967
I have seen and done some
terrible things in my life,

27:07.967 --> 27:11.009
but I can't get out of my
head what I saw at that lab.

27:11.009 --> 27:13.988
Black Lightning's the only one
who can expose what's been done

27:13.988 --> 27:15.979
and bring these
people to justice.

27:17.917 --> 27:18.963
Will you please tell him?

27:24.955 --> 27:25.955
Yes.

27:28.929 --> 27:29.959
Anissa...

27:33.005 --> 27:37.005
Regardless of what you all may think
of me, I will always care about you,

27:37.005 --> 27:39.950
and your family.

27:39.950 --> 27:42.000
And I would do anything 
to protect you.

27:48.917 --> 27:49.963
This is for you.

27:58.009 --> 27:59.917
Be safe.

28:25.921 --> 28:26.917
Dad.

28:26.992 --> 28:29.942
It's about time.

28:42.013 --> 28:43.959
I'm sorry I'm late.

28:48.917 --> 28:49.996
Uncle gambi gave it to me.

28:51.963 --> 28:52.975
Yeah, I know.

28:54.959 --> 28:56.967
Dad, look, I know you said
we can't trust him,

28:56.967 --> 28:58.988
but he gave me this because
he wants me to be safe.

28:58.988 --> 29:00.959
He cares. About all of us.

29:00.959 --> 29:03.950
Anissa, this is
between him and me.

29:03.950 --> 29:05.921
Now if you knew
the whole story...

29:05.921 --> 29:07.963
Look, I know enough.

29:07.963 --> 29:11.950
He didn't tell you something he should
have, and that... it was wrong.

29:11.950 --> 29:14.921
But Jennifer feels like
you did the same thing.

29:14.921 --> 29:15.963
No. It's completely different.

29:15.963 --> 29:16.992
Is it?

29:18.946 --> 29:20.963
It's not important.

29:20.963 --> 29:22.996
Now, Anissa, you need to know...

29:22.996 --> 29:29.000
The guys we're going after are not just
gangbangers or dealers breaking the law,

29:29.000 --> 29:31.988
they are beyond the law.

29:32.979 --> 29:34.925
So, if we take down their lab...

29:34.925 --> 29:38.934
You mean, when we take down 
their lab.

29:38.934 --> 29:44.950
When we take down their lab,
it's like declaring war.

29:44.950 --> 29:46.984
Things could go south. Big time.

29:46.984 --> 29:49.971
If they do, don't worry about me.
I want you to save yourself.

29:49.971 --> 29:52.950
Run. Live for another day.
Do you understand?

29:52.950 --> 29:56.938
Yes. I understand how
serious this moment is.

29:58.984 --> 30:00.959
Let's take your new outfit
out for a test drive.

30:08.043 --> 30:09.047
Hey.

30:14.089 --> 30:16.014
Stop right there.

30:16.014 --> 30:18.035
You said when I was
ready to talk, I could.

30:18.035 --> 30:22.022
Hey. I don't know what goes on in your
friends' families, but in this family,

30:22.022 --> 30:25.064
young ladies who roll their eyes or
give their parents the silent treatment

30:25.064 --> 30:29.018
are young ladies who can start
paying their own phone bills.

30:29.018 --> 30:30.068
Sit down.

30:41.035 --> 30:45.014
Look, there was no right
time to tell you.

30:45.014 --> 30:47.001
And I am sorry that we hurt you.

30:47.001 --> 30:49.072
But you need to know,
that being a parent,

30:49.072 --> 30:52.059
sometimes, we have to make
decisions without consulting you,

30:52.059 --> 30:54.085
and hope and pray that
they're the right ones.

30:54.085 --> 30:57.026
You didn't this time.

30:57.026 --> 31:00.022
You and dad always tell
me that you trust me.

31:01.089 --> 31:06.009
I know where this is going.
Look, honey...

31:06.009 --> 31:09.039
We couldn't have you blurt out the
wrong thing when you were little.

31:09.039 --> 31:11.055
Later, it wasn't worth you knowing

31:11.055 --> 31:14.055
because your father had stopped
being Black Lightning.

31:14.055 --> 31:19.022
The only reason he came back was to get
you and your sister out of that motel.

31:23.026 --> 31:26.022
Why didn't you tell me that I
was going to get powers, too?

31:26.022 --> 31:28.030
We didn't know, baby.

31:28.030 --> 31:30.055
We didn't know 
how Jeff got his powers,

31:30.055 --> 31:33.093
but we did know he didn't inherit them.
So why would you?

31:36.039 --> 31:37.043
I feel like a freak.

31:37.043 --> 31:40.064
No. No. No, you're not.

31:44.014 --> 31:45.064
Who's going to want
to be with me?

31:45.064 --> 31:46.064
Hey.

31:47.089 --> 31:49.059
I fell in love with your father.

31:49.059 --> 31:53.001
That's why you broke up, isn't it?

31:56.026 --> 31:58.030
Mom, tell me the truth.

32:00.047 --> 32:03.005
Is that why 
you and dad got divorced?

32:05.005 --> 32:06.009
Yes.

32:08.009 --> 32:11.014
But your father has
always been there for us.

32:11.014 --> 32:14.047
If he didn't have powers, you
two would still be together.

32:14.047 --> 32:16.064
So would Anissa and Chenoa.

32:18.026 --> 32:19.997
Mom, I'm not Anissa.

32:19.997 --> 32:21.080
I don't want to save the world.

32:23.018 --> 32:26.997
I want to go to prom, and college,

32:26.997 --> 32:29.014
and get married, and have babies.

32:33.047 --> 32:35.001
Can I even have kids?

32:38.080 --> 32:39.080
I don't...

32:39.080 --> 32:40.997
You don't know.

32:43.035 --> 32:44.068
Do you?

32:46.030 --> 32:48.018
Oh, baby, no. 
I'm so sorry.

32:53.035 --> 32:54.051
I'm so sorry.

33:04.001 --> 33:07.001
All right, so what if
he doesn't show up?

33:07.001 --> 33:09.072
No, we scared the... out
of that crooked lawyer.

33:09.072 --> 33:11.043
We did.

33:11.043 --> 33:14.085
Yeah, he knows that we'll pay
him another visit if he lied.

33:14.085 --> 33:19.005
So if he said Martin proctor will
be here tonight, he'll be here.

33:19.005 --> 33:20.018
All right.

33:21.018 --> 33:22.035
There he is.

33:24.018 --> 33:25.022
Okay.

34:01.093 --> 34:03.072
Hello. Yeah.

34:15.072 --> 34:17.022
I wish we knew 
what he was saying.

34:17.022 --> 34:18.092
No, no, no, I got it. 
He said,

34:18.092 --> 34:20.089
"something's wrong.
I can't reach Teddy.

34:20.089 --> 34:23.022
We need to move the lab tonight.
Get the last batch out."

34:23.022 --> 34:24.072
Come on. We got to go.
Let's go follow him.

34:24.072 --> 34:26.039
How did you hear that?

34:27.063 --> 34:29.030
I didn't.

34:29.030 --> 34:31.014
So a bunch of us, we took a
lip-reading class, so we could know

34:31.014 --> 34:33.092
what the police were saying about
us while we were protesting.

34:35.009 --> 34:36.030
Hmm.

34:36.030 --> 34:37.089
You know, you're not bad at this.

34:37.089 --> 34:39.034
Really?

34:39.034 --> 34:41.025
Don't get a big head.
I said "not bad," not "good."

34:41.025 --> 34:42.059
- Dad, okay. All right.
- Not bad. Let's go.

34:44.996 --> 34:46.072
Yeah, got you now.

34:48.009 --> 34:49.039
Yo, I was just about to...

34:49.039 --> 34:51.025
Yeah, I'm on Cayman.

34:51.025 --> 34:53.092
He's got his bent boys with him,
and they're with a bunch of guys.

34:53.092 --> 34:55.039
Men in black type.

34:58.030 --> 35:00.080
My gut tells me
they're up to something.

35:00.080 --> 35:02.093
'Cause they got enough
firepower to start a war.

35:02.093 --> 35:04.997
So stop following them. I'm all caught up.
I can't back you up.

35:04.997 --> 35:07.064
No, I got to. This is bad.
I can feel it.

35:09.030 --> 35:11.059
Henderson. Henderson!

35:19.226 --> 35:20.238
Hurry up!

35:20.238 --> 35:21.238
Come on, come on!

35:52.482 --> 35:53.511
Black Lightning's here!

35:53.511 --> 35:55.515
- Get out of here!
- Leave now!

35:55.515 --> 35:57.544
It's Black Lightning!
Let's get out of here!

35:59.515 --> 36:00.519
Get out of here!

36:03.499 --> 36:04.499
What was that?

36:04.499 --> 36:07.482
How should I know?

36:07.482 --> 36:10.465
Because I pay you to know.
Go see what it is.

36:40.486 --> 36:41.507
Hey!

36:45.469 --> 36:46.482
Where are you guys?

36:46.482 --> 36:47.540
We're close. Moving in now.

36:47.540 --> 36:50.532
Our friend's about to
make an appearance.

36:50.532 --> 36:52.540
And also, prepare for evac.

36:56.469 --> 36:58.511
What are you doing?
Don't shoot.

36:58.511 --> 37:00.486
Move and I'll kill the doc.

37:03.461 --> 37:05.478
You'd be doing us a favor.

37:05.478 --> 37:08.507
I'm not a bad guy! I'm a doctor.
I just...

37:08.507 --> 37:11.540
Kill thousands of people every day
with this poison you're making?

37:20.523 --> 37:21.540
You're welcome.

37:28.557 --> 37:31.503
Thank you.
Now get him out of here.

37:32.544 --> 37:34.528
Things are about to get 
a little messy.

38:01.478 --> 38:04.515
Remember, orders are to
take the target alive.

38:36.494 --> 38:38.553
And it works.
Switch to standard ammo.

38:38.553 --> 38:41.494
We got body armor,
so headshots to finish.

39:31.135 --> 39:32.135
Hey.

39:34.085 --> 39:35.089
Hey.

39:41.135 --> 39:43.077
Where's your mom?

39:43.077 --> 39:44.139
Uh, she's upstairs.
On the phone.

39:51.152 --> 39:52.173
Listen...

39:56.135 --> 40:00.127
I understand why
you've been upset with me,

40:01.123 --> 40:03.173
but I just want to say,

40:03.173 --> 40:08.173
all these years, I've kept
these secrets to protect you.

40:09.156 --> 40:11.115
And you're right.

40:11.115 --> 40:14.106
Powers aren't always a blessing,
they can be a burden.

40:14.106 --> 40:15.152
I don't want that for you.

40:15.152 --> 40:17.173
But I understand you're not
a little girl anymore,

40:20.123 --> 40:22.156
and I can't treat you like one.

40:25.089 --> 40:27.089
And that means 
bein' honest with you.

40:31.089 --> 40:32.144
And I will.

40:33.160 --> 40:34.160
Okay?

40:37.123 --> 40:38.144
From here on out.

40:45.165 --> 40:47.077
I know.

40:49.131 --> 40:53.089
Sometimes I just forget to know.

40:53.156 --> 40:55.094
But mom reminded me.

41:00.156 --> 41:03.089
You want to watch a movie?

41:08.165 --> 41:10.148
Hey, when was the last time 
we did that?

41:12.077 --> 41:14.148
I think when I had the flu.

41:14.148 --> 41:17.119
Right.

41:17.119 --> 41:19.135
You got me sick.

41:19.135 --> 41:20.148
Yeah.

41:22.165 --> 41:24.098
The Princess and the frog?

41:25.110 --> 41:26.144
Perfect.

41:26.144 --> 41:28.135
You want me to make some popcorn?

41:29.305 --> 41:35.797
