WEBVTT

00:01.267 --> 00:01.468
.

00:08.274 --> 00:10.810
The Geordies are back in the Toon.
Wicked!

00:12.011 --> 00:14.781
We are doing what we do best.
Fuck me.

00:14.848 --> 00:15.915
Partying.

00:17.384 --> 00:18.852
Tashing on.

00:18.918 --> 00:20.420
Getting mortal.

00:20.487 --> 00:21.588
Shagging.

00:22.922 --> 00:24.424
It's insane!

00:25.959 --> 00:27.794
(screams)

00:31.398 --> 00:32.966
Shit's about to get real.

00:33.032 --> 00:34.401
Oh, my God.

00:34.467 --> 00:37.804
I hope that getting this pet
will bring Charlotte back.

00:37.871 --> 00:40.306
I don't want Charlotte.
Fuck off tortoises.

00:40.373 --> 00:42.442
We should do a fitness challenge.

00:42.509 --> 00:45.845
A long assault course
and fire and tunnels and shit.

00:45.912 --> 00:48.948
All I wanna do is shove
a big sausage in my face. (burps)

00:49.749 --> 00:52.719
Oi, oi.
Double date has to happen.

00:52.786 --> 00:54.521
We're having a wicked time.

00:54.587 --> 00:56.222
Sorry I'm late.

00:56.289 --> 00:57.690
Oh, my God!

00:57.757 --> 00:59.859
This will ruin everything.
Awkward.

00:59.926 --> 01:01.494
This isn't a nice welcome.

01:01.561 --> 01:04.531
It's not me, Gary!
I've got to give it up with Gary.

01:07.467 --> 01:10.069
(gasps)
Fuck my life.

01:11.604 --> 01:14.040
I should have a degree in
pulling women.

01:14.107 --> 01:16.209
I am a Geordie girl with a VIP edge.

01:16.276 --> 01:18.812
I'm a natural beauty.
Real boobs, real hair.

01:18.878 --> 01:20.680
I'm gonna tear the place up.

01:20.747 --> 01:23.149
I've never kissed anyone
without a six pack.

01:23.216 --> 01:27.420
Hardest graft I've done is me hair.
Cheeky, colourful, full of mischief.

01:27.487 --> 01:29.289
I'm flirty
and I've got double Fs.

01:29.355 --> 01:31.724
Gonna make sparks fly,
get everyone feisty.

01:31.791 --> 01:34.127
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

01:50.743 --> 01:55.448
I've woken up this morning and who's
laid next to me? It's only Charlotte.

01:55.515 --> 01:59.118
So now we're back reunited and
the first time I chose to come in

01:59.185 --> 02:01.654
and you were fucking mortal.

02:01.721 --> 02:03.623
You didn't even recognise us.

02:03.690 --> 02:05.225
I've got my best friend back.

02:05.291 --> 02:06.926
You pissed the sofa.
Did I?

02:06.993 --> 02:08.728
Yeah, there was a wet patch.

02:08.794 --> 02:12.298
I'm back in Geordie Shore and
I've already pissed on something.

02:12.365 --> 02:14.167
One thing hasn't changed.

02:14.234 --> 02:15.702
I pissed the bed, you know.

02:15.768 --> 02:18.771
You pissed the pillow
next to me head. What do you mean?

02:18.838 --> 02:22.775
You didn't piss any of the bed,
you pissed this one pillow. Look.

02:22.842 --> 02:26.379
Does it smell like wee?
If that's wee it's a nice scent.

02:26.446 --> 02:27.447
Is it?
Mm.

02:27.514 --> 02:29.415
Aw, synchronised pissing.

02:29.482 --> 02:32.819
Me and you, back together.

02:32.886 --> 02:35.889
We're the only ones not getting with
people in the house.

02:35.955 --> 02:39.759
I'm so glad I've got someone.
You've got me, you'd always have me.

02:41.327 --> 02:44.531
I slept in Gary's bed
again last night.

02:44.597 --> 02:47.800
I don't know how this is
gonna make it with me and Charlotte.

02:54.440 --> 02:58.278
Yeah, Charlotte's back, I just hope
she isn't doing what she always does

02:58.344 --> 03:01.714
and that's get in everyone's head
and turn everyone against us.

03:03.416 --> 03:05.685
Morning.
Morning.

03:05.752 --> 03:09.088
It's nice to wake up with Aaron.
Still a little bit awkward.

03:14.527 --> 03:17.697
She's trying to say she slept here
cos there's no other beds,

03:17.764 --> 03:19.666
not that old chestnut,
you love it.

03:19.732 --> 03:22.001
I think we had a successful
first date.

03:30.343 --> 03:31.945
Poor Marnie.

03:32.011 --> 03:35.448
Charlotte was such
a massive part of Gary's life,

03:35.515 --> 03:37.116
it will be tough for Marnie.

03:48.528 --> 03:53.066
I'm going into the shag pad, I need
to get to know these tortoises.

03:54.200 --> 03:57.604
These are my pets after all, I need
to figure out which one's a boy,

03:57.670 --> 04:00.173
which one's a girl
and what I'm gonna call them.

04:00.239 --> 04:01.307
I need to bond.

04:01.374 --> 04:03.776
Is that a vagina? (gasps)

04:03.843 --> 04:08.281
I can't believe they've been living
for all this time with no name.

04:09.549 --> 04:12.452
Sheldon and Michelle.

04:13.486 --> 04:18.124
(screams) Oh, my God!
What the fuck is that, man?

04:18.190 --> 04:21.894
Oh, that is a joke!
You do not do that on people!

04:21.961 --> 04:26.065
You can fuck off back in your
shells. We've bonded enough.

04:28.868 --> 04:30.937
Hi.
I need a hand.

04:31.004 --> 04:33.206
(laughs) It's pooed?
All over us.

04:33.272 --> 04:36.643
I just wanna make sure everything's
OK with me and Charlotte.

04:36.709 --> 04:38.745
How did you feel
when you walked in?

04:38.811 --> 04:40.847
It was a bit awkward.
It was, wasn't it?

04:40.913 --> 04:42.582
It wasn't awkward, just weird.

04:42.649 --> 04:46.052
Even though I know that you don't
give a shit about Gary at all,

04:46.119 --> 04:49.188
I still wanted to stop
what was going on when you were here.

04:49.255 --> 04:52.759
Don't stop anything, Marnie.
I'm not bothered, I don't mind.

04:52.825 --> 04:56.329
Marnie's saying she's not gonna
be close to Gary while I'm around.

04:56.396 --> 04:58.097
Why?! I don't care!

04:58.164 --> 04:59.899
Go and suck him off right now.

04:59.966 --> 05:03.636
Everyone can forget about me and
Gary, which is what I've wanted.

05:03.703 --> 05:06.439
She feels exactly the same way
as she did last night.

05:06.506 --> 05:09.175
It's a relief
that I've took Gary off her hands.

05:09.242 --> 05:12.178
I think we kissed last night
you know, Charlotte.

05:12.245 --> 05:15.782
Like snogged?
Like tongues.

05:15.848 --> 05:19.385
Marnie's reminding us about
how we were kissing last night.

05:19.452 --> 05:25.324
This wasn't just a peck, it was
a full on tongue kiss. Eurgh.

05:29.562 --> 05:30.763
Be careful of the poo.

05:30.830 --> 05:33.166
Oh, I've just got some on me arm.
(laughs)

05:34.467 --> 05:37.203
We ready to rock? Buzzing.

05:37.270 --> 05:40.840
Scott and Holly don't seem to be
taking this challenge seriously

05:40.907 --> 05:43.409
and Charlotte needs
all the help she can get.

05:43.476 --> 05:47.714
I'm taking them on an assault course
whether they like it or not.

05:49.916 --> 05:52.285
We've arrived at Mud City.

05:52.351 --> 05:54.887
I'm gonna put you through
a few obstacles,

05:54.954 --> 05:57.090
so you will be getting muddy, wet.

05:57.156 --> 06:00.760
We've gotta do this stupid obstacle
course, I'm absolutely fuming.

06:00.827 --> 06:02.428
James is a twat.

06:02.495 --> 06:03.663
That's it.

06:03.730 --> 06:07.500
So I'm on the monkey bars, swinging
round like a fucking orangutan.

06:07.567 --> 06:10.570
Whereas the hippos and
the fairy princess find it hard.

06:10.636 --> 06:12.405
(laughter)

06:12.472 --> 06:15.241
Go! Yes, yeah!

06:15.308 --> 06:17.376
(groans)

06:17.443 --> 06:18.578
(shouts)

06:18.644 --> 06:20.213
Yeah.

06:20.279 --> 06:23.149
This assault course
isn't gonna know what hit it.

06:23.216 --> 06:25.084
Fucking hell.

06:25.151 --> 06:27.887
(laughs)

06:27.954 --> 06:29.055
Oh, my God.

06:38.865 --> 06:41.934
Now I don't wanna be crawling into
a little black hole

06:42.001 --> 06:43.669
and not knowing where it leads.

06:43.736 --> 06:46.139
I know the boys do it every night,
but not me.

06:46.205 --> 06:49.475
(screams)
Get out!

06:51.844 --> 06:55.414
Holly better watch out she doesn't
burst one of her inflatables.

06:57.283 --> 07:02.922
Running in mud under ropes, running
in mud under nets. This is shit.

07:04.423 --> 07:05.458
(screams)

07:05.525 --> 07:09.362
What better way to get clean than
jump in the river? Oh, my God!

07:10.797 --> 07:13.933
James is winging that it's cold
but I think it's warm as out,

07:14.000 --> 07:15.034
cos I'm pure solid.

07:18.671 --> 07:20.306
Yeah.
Yeah.

07:20.873 --> 07:22.175
Yeah, we're getting in.

07:22.241 --> 07:24.010
We tell the boys we'll jump in.

07:24.076 --> 07:26.712
That's it, now kick your legs. Kick.

07:29.682 --> 07:32.051
Did you think
we were actually gonna do that?

07:34.287 --> 07:36.088
Where the fuck are the girls?

07:37.156 --> 07:43.162
Marnie came up to us again trying to
talk about this her and Gary thing.

07:43.229 --> 07:44.864
What does she mean though?

07:44.931 --> 07:49.101
She's just saying I hope I'm OK and
she knows it's against girl code.

07:49.168 --> 07:51.504
Eh? Why would Charlotte be bothered?

07:51.571 --> 07:56.309
It's only Marnie making the situation
awkward. Charlotte has a boyfriend.

07:56.375 --> 07:59.412
She was like, "We'll stop
doing stuff in front of you",

07:59.478 --> 08:00.813
I was like "Why?"

08:00.880 --> 08:04.717
I've got a boyfriend, I've been
with him for over a year now,

08:04.784 --> 08:08.221
like, just do what you've gotta do
with Gary,

08:08.287 --> 08:11.257
nothing's weird here,
you're the one making it weird.

08:11.324 --> 08:13.826
I think she's looking for
a seal of approval.

08:13.893 --> 08:17.263
Why does Marnie feel the need to
have to come to me for my consent?

08:17.330 --> 08:22.168
I'm not bothered. Do what youse want
to do. Me and Gary are so 2004.

08:22.235 --> 08:25.471
I never want to hear Gary and
Charlotte in a sentence again.

08:32.278 --> 08:33.279
No.

08:33.346 --> 08:36.549
Everyone else has gone to do
an assault course. Fuck that.

08:36.616 --> 08:40.486
Me and Aaron get Marnie and Vicky
and now it's time for our second date

08:40.553 --> 08:43.522
and believe me,
there'll be no candles involved.

08:52.164 --> 08:54.967
Girls are gonna fucking kill us
when they find out.

08:55.034 --> 08:57.637
If they're in wedges and a dress
I'll piss myself.

08:57.703 --> 09:02.808
Vicky they've just told us that
they're gonna take us on a date.

09:02.875 --> 09:06.279
Me and Vicky have no idea
what this date is gonna entail.

09:06.345 --> 09:08.648
Hopefully something like
we done for them.

09:08.714 --> 09:12.118
Have you any more sort of
inclination? Dressy caj.

09:12.184 --> 09:14.720
Dressy caj? Who do they think
they are, Gok Wan?

09:14.787 --> 09:17.523
Where on Earth did they even
learn these phrases?

09:27.233 --> 09:29.335
Where we going, lads?

09:29.402 --> 09:32.038
The girls are hoping
we've done something nice

09:32.104 --> 09:35.107
but come on, it's me and Gary,
that's not how we roll.

09:35.174 --> 09:36.776
Oh, no!

09:36.842 --> 09:39.378
The double date is paintballing.

09:39.445 --> 09:42.515
Typical lads,
always thinking about themselves.

09:47.586 --> 09:50.289
It's not that I'm not excited
about paintballing,

09:50.356 --> 09:53.292
it's just that...
I don't wanna do it.

09:53.359 --> 09:54.760
Can I have an extra one?

09:54.827 --> 09:57.296
I'm taking no chances
in this situation.

09:57.363 --> 10:01.000
I'm going into it like every woman
should go into having sex with Gaz.

10:01.067 --> 10:02.835
With extra fucking protection.

10:07.573 --> 10:10.609
It's time to let the battle of
the couples commence.

10:29.562 --> 10:32.331
Couple versus couple?
I'm at a disadvantage

10:32.398 --> 10:35.601
because all Vicky cares about
is her hair and her nails.

10:45.311 --> 10:46.412
Vicky tried though.

10:46.479 --> 10:49.849
Paintballing was a success.
Girls weren't impressed at first,

10:49.915 --> 10:53.019
but fumbling around in the woods
put a smile on their face.

10:53.085 --> 10:56.255
Thank you for the second date,
it's been really nice.

10:56.322 --> 10:58.024
You think there'll be a third?

10:58.090 --> 11:00.459
Me and Aaron had a good time
on the first date,

11:00.526 --> 11:05.731
second date's going well, so logical
conclusion would be third date, yes?

11:06.866 --> 11:10.136
We get on well as mates, so...
I think that's fair to say.

11:10.202 --> 11:14.407
All right, mate, I fucking get it.
Third date's off the cards.

11:14.473 --> 11:16.609
I'm hardly gonna be crying
in my pillow.

11:16.675 --> 11:18.144
Fucking hell.

11:18.210 --> 11:20.780
Me and Marnie had a wicked time
paintballing,

11:20.846 --> 11:22.481
but I feel it's time to tell her

11:22.548 --> 11:24.617
that I'm never gonna go
on a third date,

11:24.683 --> 11:27.386
it was sex and fun
but I wanna pie things off.

11:34.326 --> 11:35.728
Right.

11:38.464 --> 11:41.534
So Gary's telling us that me and him
should cool things off

11:41.600 --> 11:44.804
so I can spend time with the girls,
basically he's pied us.

11:49.842 --> 11:51.210
I'm absolutely fuming.

11:51.277 --> 11:53.779
But my priority is fitting in
with the girls,

11:53.846 --> 11:56.715
I never wanna go through
what I went through last time.

11:58.517 --> 12:01.120
Finally got Gaz back as my wingman.

12:01.187 --> 12:04.490
I fucking knew it, Gary with
a girl at each side of him.

12:04.557 --> 12:06.325
Two can play that game.

12:06.392 --> 12:09.028
Hate to admit it,
but I'm glad Vicky's here.

12:09.095 --> 12:11.730
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

12:13.599 --> 12:13.799
.

12:16.402 --> 12:16.602
.

12:26.879 --> 12:29.748
(screams)
Oh, my God!

12:29.815 --> 12:31.684
Don't panic, they're Charlotte's.

12:31.750 --> 12:34.887
They've got a bit of poo on.
(laughs) Oh, God.

12:38.390 --> 12:41.627
Me and James need to get Gaz
and Aaron away from these birds

12:41.694 --> 12:44.230
and what better way
than to have a lads' night?

12:46.165 --> 12:47.199
Just the boys.
Yes.

12:48.567 --> 12:50.936
Tonight is perfect
for a lads' night out.

12:51.003 --> 12:54.240
I've just palmed off Marnie,
Aaron's just palmed off Vicky

12:54.306 --> 12:55.908
and now we can do what we want

12:55.975 --> 12:58.210
without them watching
every single move.

13:12.224 --> 13:15.161
Aaron and Gary
both pied me and Vicky,

13:15.227 --> 13:17.229
he's bound to pull
on the lads' night.

13:17.296 --> 13:19.098
How it'll make us feel I'm not sure.

13:19.165 --> 13:20.633
So what the hell's going on?

13:23.435 --> 13:25.738
Why? What happened? Come on.
Stop it.

13:25.804 --> 13:27.339
You need to fill us in, man.

13:27.406 --> 13:29.375
Fuck the lads, where do they get off

13:29.441 --> 13:31.777
telling us
they're having a lads' night?

13:31.844 --> 13:34.346
I'm not fucking having this.
We're going out.

13:34.413 --> 13:36.482
We're just not fucking
telling them.

13:36.549 --> 13:39.084
We'll have a better night
than they ever could.

13:39.151 --> 13:42.288
To pissing and ruining.
To pissing and ruining.

13:49.094 --> 13:52.198
It's lads' night tonight
and we're in Bijoux, buzzing.

13:59.572 --> 14:02.975
Tonight is the perfect chance to
pull birds and show the girls

14:03.042 --> 14:04.977
that there is no more double dates.

14:05.044 --> 14:07.913
Youse have been pied off
and we're moving on.

14:09.415 --> 14:11.850
Finally got Gaz back as me wingman.

14:17.590 --> 14:19.892
You two don't look very ready.

14:19.959 --> 14:21.894
We've decided we're not coming out.

14:21.961 --> 14:24.396
Vicky and Marnie are
cock blocking the lads,

14:24.463 --> 14:27.099
they're gonna ruin their night,
it's hilarious,

14:27.166 --> 14:30.269
but me and Charlotte are hungover,
we're going to bed.

14:35.574 --> 14:39.545
Holly and Charlotte dropped me and
Marnie in it at the last minute,

14:39.612 --> 14:44.250
now we're gonna look like psycho
bunny boilers out to cock block.

14:45.551 --> 14:46.752
(laughter)

14:52.558 --> 14:56.428
I'm having the most perfect
lads' night ever.

14:56.495 --> 14:59.331
I've pied off Marnie,
I'm allowed to pull,

14:59.398 --> 15:02.401
whether she kicks off or not
I'm still gonna do it.

15:08.374 --> 15:11.610
The lads think they're clever
having a boys' night, fuck it.

15:16.515 --> 15:18.384
No, Marnie!

15:18.450 --> 15:20.919
Surprise fucking surprise,

15:20.986 --> 15:25.624
in come Marnie and fucking Vicky like
queen bees and spoil the whole night.

15:27.593 --> 15:31.430
I fucking knew it, Gary's sat there
with a girl at each side of him.

15:32.731 --> 15:34.133
He won't even look at us.

15:34.199 --> 15:37.569
If this situation is awkward
he's making it much worse.

15:50.816 --> 15:52.818
Marnie acts like she's not bothered,

15:52.885 --> 15:55.087
but I think we all know
that she really is.

16:06.565 --> 16:09.768
Gary thinks he's so clever,
but two can play at that game

16:09.835 --> 16:13.205
and I'm better at it and
I've spotted Scott's friend Kieran.

16:27.052 --> 16:30.856
I'm sure Marnie thinks that we are
14 years old, running around school,

16:30.923 --> 16:34.293
"Look, Gary kissed a girl so
I'm gonna go and kiss another boy."

16:34.360 --> 16:35.394
I don't give a fuck.

16:41.533 --> 16:42.835
Exactly.

16:48.240 --> 16:50.743
I hate to admit it,
but I'm glad Vicky's here.

16:50.809 --> 16:53.278
Nice to have some female attention.

16:55.414 --> 16:57.983
I thought Aaron
on his first lads' night out

16:58.050 --> 17:01.387
would have pulled some birds with
me and Scott, but he hasn't,

17:01.453 --> 17:04.356
he's gone to the fucking dark side.

17:26.412 --> 17:28.380
Marnie's trying to get a reaction

17:28.446 --> 17:31.984
but I know I've got my wingman back
and he doesn't give a fuck.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.396
Marnie?

17:50.936 --> 17:52.571
Me and Scott go straight to bed.

17:52.638 --> 17:55.407
I don't wanna hang with girls
who spoilt our night

17:55.474 --> 17:58.177
and I don't wanna wake up
tomorrow morning

17:58.243 --> 18:01.480
and I've done something I regret.

18:01.547 --> 18:05.083
Me and Aaron didn't pull anyone
else, so we're gonna come home,

18:05.150 --> 18:08.020
have a little bit of a kiss,
a little bit of a cuddle.

18:08.086 --> 18:09.521
No, let's go to bed.

18:13.158 --> 18:14.493
I'm fucking shattered.

18:31.410 --> 18:35.013
I can't believe last night they
turned up and ruined a lads' night,

18:35.080 --> 18:36.648
we wouldn't do that to them.

18:50.395 --> 18:53.131
At least she came,
seen me kissing a girl

18:53.198 --> 18:55.167
and now she might actually move on.

18:55.234 --> 18:57.102
So, what happened last night then?

18:57.169 --> 18:59.304
Well, it was an interesting one.

18:59.371 --> 19:01.940
Last night I caught Gary
with another girl,

19:02.007 --> 19:03.242
I know where I stand.

19:03.308 --> 19:06.478
It felt awkward and it really
annoyed us, cos I thought,

19:06.545 --> 19:07.946
"Why is it awkward?"

19:08.013 --> 19:13.051
I think Aaron was genuinely happy,
sees his two housemates turn up.

19:13.118 --> 19:14.720
Last night wasn't awkward.

19:14.786 --> 19:17.723
Me and Aaron are getting on great,
it was a win for me.

19:17.789 --> 19:19.758
Did they bring girls back?

19:19.825 --> 19:22.094
No, we walked in
and the lasses walked out.

19:22.160 --> 19:24.897
I said where have they gone?
I think they ran away.

19:24.963 --> 19:26.164
(laughter)

19:30.202 --> 19:32.638
(phone rings)

19:35.107 --> 19:36.408
Hello?

19:36.475 --> 19:38.977
"Is that Vicky?"
It is indeed, is that Anna?

19:39.044 --> 19:40.112
"It is, Vicky, yes."

19:43.081 --> 19:44.983
I smashed it, Anna, didn't I?

19:47.519 --> 19:49.588
Oh, tash on, why-aye.

19:52.391 --> 19:53.425
Fuck off.

19:53.492 --> 19:56.228
We've been doing so well
in Newcastle

19:56.295 --> 19:59.264
she's decided to take
her operation national.

19:59.331 --> 20:03.268
Guess what. We're going to
Manchester for a Tash on Tour.

20:03.335 --> 20:05.370
Get in. Buzzing.

20:05.437 --> 20:07.839
I'm buzzing
like Holly's underwear drawer.

20:07.906 --> 20:12.277
No rules, we just have to get the
whole of Manchester tashing on.

20:12.344 --> 20:16.648
The lads seem really excited about
heading to Manchester.

20:16.715 --> 20:20.085
Could they be excited about
a different city's culture?

20:20.152 --> 20:22.421
No, it's the prospect of
fresh fanny.

20:22.487 --> 20:24.456
Get up.
I can't fucking wait.

20:24.523 --> 20:27.125
Mint to get out of this house
for a bit.

20:27.192 --> 20:32.364
I dunno which way to Manchester,
but I know it's canny close.

20:38.670 --> 20:42.207
Girls on tour, girls on tour,
girls on tour.

20:42.274 --> 20:45.611
Girls' night tonight.
(girls cheer)

20:46.812 --> 20:48.747
I love how the lasses
are getting on,

20:48.814 --> 20:52.351
we're gonna have loads of fun and me
and Vicky are gonna pull boys.

21:04.963 --> 21:09.167
Manchester, Manchester, Manchester.

21:09.234 --> 21:10.268
That was an M.

21:10.335 --> 21:13.205
It's the girls' room!
(all cheer)

21:13.705 --> 21:15.807
Manchester, we've arrived.

21:17.175 --> 21:18.810
Tashing on all over the shop,

21:18.877 --> 21:21.380
I'm sure I just saw someone
slip a finger in.

21:21.446 --> 21:25.183
I can't resist touching them.
(hooter sound)

21:25.250 --> 21:27.252
Yeah, yeah, but why?

21:27.319 --> 21:29.921
Now there's definitely a divide,
fucking tramp.

21:31.823 --> 21:34.493
(all) Geordie Shore, why-aye!

21:36.361 --> 21:36.561
.

21:39.231 --> 21:39.431
.

21:49.708 --> 21:54.012
We're so excited to be here,
we're even going for pre drinks,

21:54.079 --> 21:56.815
drinks before the actual drinks.

21:56.882 --> 21:58.850
Who even invented this?

22:00.852 --> 22:02.187
Shot time.

22:02.254 --> 22:05.757
So we're in a shot bar
and there's only one thing to do.

22:05.824 --> 22:07.793
Drink some shots.

22:11.163 --> 22:14.666
Shit gets crazy
when you down shots in Manchester,

22:14.733 --> 22:17.602
shit gets crazy
when you down shots in Manchester.

22:17.669 --> 22:20.138
All I came here to do is
have so much fun.

22:20.205 --> 22:23.508
Yeah. I just wanna be laughing
every two seconds.

22:23.575 --> 22:25.577
Ha, ha, ha.
(laughs)

22:25.644 --> 22:28.580
I don't understand
how Charlotte and Marnie,

22:28.647 --> 22:31.216
two people who have never,
ever got on

22:31.283 --> 22:34.653
all of a sudden are best mates,
what's all that about?

22:34.720 --> 22:38.256
Obviously when I came in you and
Gary were, like, together. Yeah.

22:38.323 --> 22:40.625
I've noticed Marnie
pulling away from Gary

22:40.692 --> 22:42.961
and I don't wanna be
the reason for that.

22:43.028 --> 22:46.898
I need to let her know I'm 100%
supportive of her and Gary.

22:46.965 --> 22:50.802
It was a total bad move to start
with, I shouldn't have gone there.

22:50.869 --> 22:55.173
I don't think you should think it
was a bad move, you just tried it.

22:55.240 --> 22:57.843
Yeah. Yeah, it didn't work.
And you had fun. Yeah.

22:57.909 --> 23:00.545
And it's not like
it hasn't worked yet.

23:00.612 --> 23:03.014
Charlotte,
who I've had a very crazy past with

23:03.081 --> 23:06.651
and girl I just pied off
having a chat.

23:06.718 --> 23:08.887
That is like juggling live grenades.

23:20.732 --> 23:23.568
It's unbelievable how Charlotte
can change a house,

23:23.635 --> 23:25.637
it's gone back to boys versus girls.

23:29.674 --> 23:33.779
What the girls can't see is they have
changed when Charlotte came in.

23:33.845 --> 23:36.581
Whether Charlotte knows or not,
it has

23:36.648 --> 23:40.352
and it's girls V boys
and that never goes down well.

23:43.255 --> 23:45.824
It's the first time
we're taking Tash on Tours

23:45.891 --> 23:48.927
outside of Newcastle
and I really wanna do Anna proud.

23:50.128 --> 23:52.998
Basically we just have to get
everyone to neck on, mint.

23:53.064 --> 23:55.934
Youse all ready to do this?

23:58.603 --> 24:02.140
We're gonna show these Mancs what
Geordies are made of and smash it.

24:02.207 --> 24:04.509
You are all here
because you're single.

24:04.576 --> 24:08.146
(cheering) We are here for
our first Tash on Tours,

24:08.213 --> 24:13.051
we just want everyone to have fun,
to get drunk and ultimately neck on.

24:15.320 --> 24:17.589
I really like these single nights,

24:17.656 --> 24:21.326
I feel like the fairy tash mother
getting everyone together.

24:21.393 --> 24:26.331
I can't pull myself, but I can
definitely make other people pull,

24:26.398 --> 24:28.967
because I am like Cilla Black
with brown hair.

24:29.034 --> 24:31.036
Can someone neck on with her?

24:35.273 --> 24:37.843
Neck on.

24:38.877 --> 24:39.978
Go on.

24:40.045 --> 24:41.746
We're not good at our jobs,

24:41.813 --> 24:45.717
but Tash on Tours
we are absolutely smashing.

24:49.855 --> 24:53.558
It's only fair that sometimes
I do have to take one for my team

24:53.625 --> 24:56.628
and when I spot
a handsome stranger standing there

24:56.695 --> 24:59.965
without a kissing sticker,
I just have to neck on.

25:01.633 --> 25:04.169
There's no point
trying to compete with Vicky,

25:04.236 --> 25:07.072
she has got the
sluttiest mouth in the north east.

25:08.974 --> 25:11.810
Vicky tells us
she's had a really bad snog.

25:15.513 --> 25:16.681
(shudders) Minging.

25:18.483 --> 25:21.253
Got birds hanging off
left, right and centre.

25:22.487 --> 25:26.558
There's loads of naughty birds
and everyone seems game as fuck.

25:27.692 --> 25:30.729
I feel sorry for all the people
turning up to Tash on Tours

25:30.795 --> 25:34.666
realising they're not gonna be able
to get with me. Soz, I'm taken.

25:36.534 --> 25:39.838
Scott is with this girl with
massive boobs and nipples on show.

25:42.574 --> 25:44.175
I can't resist touching them.

25:45.277 --> 25:46.611
(hooter sound)

25:46.678 --> 25:49.014
No.
Oh, my God, they feel so nice.

25:55.954 --> 25:58.223
Tonight is a total success.

25:58.290 --> 26:00.358
There's tashing on all over the shop

26:00.425 --> 26:03.561
and I'm pretty sure
I just saw someone slip a finger in.

26:09.601 --> 26:12.370
Everyone's tashing on,
lips locking everywhere,

26:12.437 --> 26:13.872
Anna is gonna be happy.

26:15.974 --> 26:18.209
Holly has changed
since Charlotte came,

26:18.276 --> 26:20.545
she's acting like
Charlotte's lap dog.

26:25.951 --> 26:30.055
If things keep going on there's
gonna be a massive boy-girl divide,

26:30.121 --> 26:34.159
a boy-girl divide that was never
ever there before Charlotte came.

26:35.727 --> 26:37.629
Yes!
Yes!

26:37.696 --> 26:40.198
It's now time to let our hair done
and get pissed.

26:40.265 --> 26:42.200
Balls deep, balls deep.

26:59.884 --> 27:03.288
We haven't been in the club two
minutes and Aaron's come over to me

27:03.355 --> 27:05.790
and told me
Charlotte's caused the divide.

27:10.161 --> 27:13.999
Aaron has been here five minutes,
I dunno who the fuck he thinks he is.

27:24.843 --> 27:26.411
Holly can defend Charlotte,

27:26.478 --> 27:30.048
but it's obvious things changed
since she came in, for the worse.

27:30.115 --> 27:35.553
Yeah, yeah, but why? Why? Why? Why?

27:46.131 --> 27:48.500
I can't believe
the way the girls spoke to us,

27:48.566 --> 27:51.836
now there's definitely a divide,
you fucking tramp.

27:54.105 --> 27:56.508
I never spent any time
with Aaron anyway

27:56.574 --> 27:58.510
and now I won't fucking want to.

28:07.052 --> 28:10.522
Holly and Aaron have fallen out,
nobody's speaking to each other.

28:10.588 --> 28:13.358
Me, I'm just fucking pissed.

28:24.335 --> 28:26.504
The dynamics in the house
have changed,

28:26.571 --> 28:29.941
I'm not arguing, but I don't think
it's fair to blame Charlotte,

28:30.008 --> 28:32.110
Gary's just using her
as a scapegoat.

28:39.684 --> 28:40.985
I'm glad Vicky agrees,

28:41.052 --> 28:44.923
hopefully she can speak to the girls
and get us back to being a family.

28:54.866 --> 28:58.203
Ever since I walked in this house
the lads pied the girls off

28:58.269 --> 29:00.972
and then wanted
to go out on a lads' night.

29:01.039 --> 29:04.109
How is that me
causing a boy-girl divide?

29:04.175 --> 29:08.446
That is the boys
causing the boy-girl divide!

29:19.891 --> 29:23.561
I thought coming down to Manchester
we'd have all had an amazing time,

29:23.628 --> 29:26.264
but seems like this lot just
wanna fucking argue,

29:26.331 --> 29:29.234
we may as well have
stayed in Newcastle.

29:35.373 --> 29:36.374
What?

29:38.843 --> 29:41.346
Gary's been giving it the big 'un
to all the lads

29:41.412 --> 29:45.350
and as soon as he talks to Charlotte
he drops his arse, fucking pussy.

29:46.851 --> 29:50.989
I'm fed up of Gary shit stirring all
the time, so I'm gonna do something,

29:51.055 --> 29:54.025
I'm gonna confront him
and anything he's got to say

29:54.092 --> 29:55.326
he can say it to me face.

30:10.808 --> 30:14.012
Whether she knows it or not,
this happened because of her.

30:22.120 --> 30:26.057
I've made it quite clear that
I am perfectly fine and happy

30:26.124 --> 30:29.661
with Gary and Marnie getting
together. What do I need to do?

30:29.727 --> 30:34.132
Shove Gary's penis into Marnie's
vagina for everyone to see that?

30:41.839 --> 30:45.243
The root of this problem is
coming from Gary and Marnie,

30:45.310 --> 30:49.714
so they should go and sort
this problem out by themselves.

31:03.127 --> 31:05.797
So Gary's trying to
worm his way back in by flirting

31:05.863 --> 31:08.433
and telling us I'm fit,
it's not gonna work.

31:25.350 --> 31:27.986
I do like Aaron,
but when he's had a drink

31:28.052 --> 31:32.156
he turns into an absolute
Larry lightweight.

31:32.223 --> 31:35.960
It just so happens when I'm drunk
I turn into a bit of a slaggy Suzie

31:36.027 --> 31:40.164
and slaggy Suzie loves herself
a bit of Larry lightweight.

31:40.231 --> 31:44.402
We have an incredible bond...
it focuses solely around tequila.

31:46.904 --> 31:51.042
Looks like everyone is far too pissed
to worry about this boy-girl divide,

31:51.109 --> 31:54.245
it's time to leave the club
and get back to the apartment.

31:59.684 --> 32:02.387
Right, I'm sick of you.
I'm going to bed.

32:04.122 --> 32:06.224
I dunno whether I'm coming or going.

32:06.291 --> 32:09.661
One minute Gary and Aaron say
they don't want Vicky and Marnie,

32:09.727 --> 32:10.862
next minute they do.

32:10.928 --> 32:13.431
These lot need to go to
couples therapy.

32:17.135 --> 32:20.772
I'm tired, I'm pissed, I'm gonna
take Larry lightweight to bed

32:20.838 --> 32:22.674
and have a spoon, why not?

32:23.841 --> 32:26.611
Vicky and Aaron have gone to bed
and pinched my room.

32:26.678 --> 32:28.112
Where am I gonna sleep?

32:33.518 --> 32:36.254
I'm encouraging Gary to sleep
in my bed with Marnie,

32:36.321 --> 32:38.923
but Marnie doesn't seem up for it
at all.

32:38.990 --> 32:42.226
How many times do I have to say
you have nothing to worry about?

32:43.161 --> 32:44.162
Stop it though.

32:45.630 --> 32:49.567
You honestly think I would go back
there after the situation we've had?

32:49.634 --> 32:52.804
Charlotte won't let it go
and the fact she keeps on saying

32:52.870 --> 32:56.274
she's all right with me and Gary
is making us think she's not.

32:56.774 --> 32:58.376
I feel like everyone hates us.

32:58.443 --> 33:01.846
Why the fuck would someone wanna be
so fucking horrible?

33:01.913 --> 33:03.948
The F bomb, feelings.

33:11.789 --> 33:11.989
.

33:14.625 --> 33:14.826
.

33:31.109 --> 33:33.444
Last night
just got massively out of hand

33:33.511 --> 33:36.013
and I hope today everyone is OK.

33:40.752 --> 33:44.222
Gary's adamant Charlotte's to blame
for the divide, but he is,

33:44.288 --> 33:48.126
him and the boys asked for a boys'
night, what did he expect to happen?

33:48.192 --> 33:50.461
(cries)
What's the matter?

33:50.528 --> 33:52.497
Come here.

33:52.563 --> 33:55.700
Everyone is talking about
me causing a divide.

33:55.767 --> 33:57.969
What the fuck is up with that?

33:58.035 --> 34:01.105
Why the fuck would someone wanna be
so fucking horrible?

34:01.172 --> 34:04.575
I just dunno why I've come in

34:04.642 --> 34:06.944
and it seems like everyone
is literally...

34:07.011 --> 34:10.214
I dunno, I come in and I just
wanted to get along with everyone

34:10.281 --> 34:16.254
and have a good time and somehow
I just feel like everyone hates us.

34:16.320 --> 34:19.556
I'm so angry that everyone's made
Charlotte feel this way.

34:19.623 --> 34:23.561
She's crying her fucking eyes out
and she hasn't done anything wrong.

34:23.628 --> 34:25.897
I had such high hopes
for Manchester.

34:25.963 --> 34:29.266
Gary's blaming Charlotte,
Charlotte's having none of it,

34:29.333 --> 34:30.534
what a disaster.

34:30.601 --> 34:33.404
Let's get everything sorted,
let's just do it today.

34:33.471 --> 34:36.206
Right, we'll go for lunch
and we'll just say,

34:36.274 --> 34:38.708
"If you've got a problem
say it now."

34:42.346 --> 34:44.449
All we need to do is go out today,

34:44.514 --> 34:47.819
get something to eat, cure the
hangovers and sort this all out.

34:47.885 --> 34:49.920
We're not gonna come for lunch.

34:50.855 --> 34:55.493
We're going somewhere else.
We're going to, like, a planetarium.

34:55.560 --> 34:59.697
So what do Holly and Charlotte do?
Go to a fucking museum.

34:59.764 --> 35:02.500
Bye, enjoy lunch.
Bye, bye.

35:02.567 --> 35:04.001
Perfect timing, girls.

35:11.042 --> 35:13.811
Sorted.
Can't wait for some nice food, like.

35:16.113 --> 35:20.117
Charlotte and Holly's argument
is that there is not a divide

35:20.184 --> 35:22.386
and if there is
they're not to blame,

35:22.453 --> 35:25.490
but by not turning up to brunch
today they're causing one.

35:26.924 --> 35:29.260
Me and Charlotte can't be bothered,

35:29.327 --> 35:33.030
we're gonna go and do something fun,
we're going to a museum.

35:34.999 --> 35:38.436
Oh, my God, this is so weird,
I've never done this before.

35:40.471 --> 35:43.574
I don't think the boys
have evolved yet.

35:43.641 --> 35:45.810
Nah. They haven't grown a backbone.

35:45.877 --> 35:47.612
I feel much better now.

35:47.678 --> 35:50.181
I'm just glad we've did
some kind of activity

35:50.248 --> 35:53.384
to get our minds off what's going on
at the minute. I know.

35:53.451 --> 35:57.788
Aaron came up to me like, "You've
changed since Charlotte came."

35:57.855 --> 35:59.557
I was like, "I'm not being funny,

35:59.624 --> 36:02.560
you've been here five minutes,
shut the fuck up."

36:02.627 --> 36:06.631
"You don't have a clue
what you're talking about."

36:09.200 --> 36:12.336
(they laugh)

36:12.403 --> 36:16.173
James not knowing what's going on.
James is definitely the middle one.

36:16.240 --> 36:20.344
Scott's definitely a big one.
Yeah, yeah, dopey looking.

36:24.248 --> 36:27.652
Manchester was a disaster
and everything still isn't resolved

36:27.718 --> 36:29.020
with the girls and boys.

36:29.086 --> 36:31.656
Hopefully we'll sort it out
when we get back.

36:38.763 --> 36:42.300
Getting back to our house,
I hope Manchester's been forgotten.

36:42.366 --> 36:44.902
I want everyone to get along

36:44.969 --> 36:46.771
and things will be so much easier.

36:47.505 --> 36:49.173
(boys cheer)

36:56.213 --> 36:58.482
Hiya.

36:58.549 --> 37:00.685
Nice of you to fucking turn up,
like.

37:00.751 --> 37:03.921
In walks Charlotte and Holly,
time these two turned up.

37:03.988 --> 37:06.924
Hi, everyone.
Glad to have youse back, the family.

37:06.991 --> 37:10.227
Me and Holly get back
and the atmosphere's amazing.

37:10.294 --> 37:12.930
Everyone laughing, drinking,
playing ping pong,

37:12.997 --> 37:15.466
it's like I stepped into
a different house.

37:15.533 --> 37:17.101
(all) Family!

37:17.168 --> 37:20.037
To family!
Fucking family!

37:20.104 --> 37:22.773
Does this actually mean
the drama's forgotten?

37:22.840 --> 37:26.043
Is this not gonna get brought up
again? I highly doubt it.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.884
Is everyone excited?
Yeah.

37:33.951 --> 37:37.588
No-one really wants to talk about
last night cos it's so awkward,

37:37.655 --> 37:41.759
so we're all pretending that we're
all fine and one big happy family.

37:53.170 --> 37:56.841
Everyone's having an amazing night,
smiles on their faces

37:56.907 --> 37:59.810
tonight could be the night
everyone gets on.

38:08.519 --> 38:10.821
I think I'm starting to
like Gary again

38:10.888 --> 38:12.823
and I don't know
what the fuck to do.

38:24.935 --> 38:28.939
I'm scared Gary's gonna pie us,
but Vicky's convincing us he won't.

38:29.006 --> 38:31.275
I just hope she's right.

38:41.085 --> 38:43.688
Tonight Aaron needs to
wind his fucking neck in,

38:43.754 --> 38:46.424
forget about shit with Vicky
and pull a new bird.

38:56.233 --> 39:00.171
What better weapon of choice than to
have Scotty T help him on his quest

39:00.237 --> 39:01.839
to find the fucking golden box?

39:18.456 --> 39:21.158
I don't care if
I'm making Gary feel uncomfortable,

39:21.225 --> 39:24.428
I need to tell him how I feel
and he just needs to listen.

39:36.407 --> 39:38.876
The F bomb, feelings.

39:46.917 --> 39:50.454
There's no way I'm discussing
feelings with pissed Marnie.

39:50.521 --> 39:52.723
This can wait
until she's sober tomorrow.

39:57.294 --> 40:01.365
I hate the way Gary knows exactly
what to say to win us back round.

40:01.432 --> 40:02.833
He knows I love a cuddle.

40:20.785 --> 40:24.321
The only way to make things better
is to sort this shit out,

40:24.388 --> 40:28.425
Gary is the only one who's stirring
this all up and causing a problem.

40:42.072 --> 40:46.677
We agree we're gonna be friends
and no more bitching behind me back.

40:54.318 --> 40:56.587
It's actually nice
that me and Charlotte,

40:56.654 --> 41:00.291
after everything, are still friends,
that even amazes me.

41:09.033 --> 41:12.369
So, I can see Gary and Charlotte
talking and I know it's daft,

41:12.436 --> 41:15.673
but I'm drunk and I'm getting
a little bit jealous.

41:22.012 --> 41:23.781
It's always in the back of my mind

41:23.848 --> 41:26.951
that things between Charlotte
and Gary isn't resolved.

41:41.332 --> 41:45.069
I never thought that Charlotte would
be the one to make us feel better,

41:45.135 --> 41:48.572
they're only friends and there's
nothing between them any more.

41:54.144 --> 41:57.181
Marnie's telling us
that she's got feelings for Gary

41:57.248 --> 42:00.885
and I'm over the moon that she's
admitting it to herself as well.

42:02.453 --> 42:04.088
I think she should be careful,

42:04.154 --> 42:07.124
because Gary's not the best
of people to start liking.

42:09.560 --> 42:11.295
Tonight I just need to make sure

42:11.362 --> 42:13.864
I stay strong
and don't sleep with Gary.

42:28.245 --> 42:32.082
I must be fucking mortal, now I'm
necking on with Gary in the taxi.

42:32.149 --> 42:33.984
What's wrong with us?

42:34.652 --> 42:36.921
Yeah, all mine!

42:39.390 --> 42:42.493
We get back to the house, hoping
for a little bit of a tash on,

42:42.559 --> 42:44.361
a little bit of a spoon with Aaron,

42:44.428 --> 42:46.463
typically he's completely mortal,

42:46.530 --> 42:49.867
so I put him to bed, take his
shoes off and turn out the lights.

42:52.202 --> 42:55.239
It's getting a bit like
having a drunken labradoodle.

42:58.042 --> 43:01.879
Now that Marnie's dropped the F bomb
this cannot keep going much longer,

43:01.946 --> 43:06.984
I need to get one last bang
out of her before shit goes west.

43:13.424 --> 43:15.592
This is the end of me and Gary.

43:16.994 --> 43:18.128
He can fuck off.

43:18.195 --> 43:21.165
I thought you were me mate.
How two faced do you wanna be?

43:21.231 --> 43:24.601
I'm really, really sorry.
He point blank hates us.

43:24.668 --> 43:26.203
Just leave it, man.

43:26.270 --> 43:27.571
Oh, my God!

43:27.638 --> 43:30.441
Oh, my God,
there's a new boy in the house.

43:30.507 --> 43:33.811
Welcome to the Geordie Shore house,
please enter here or here.

43:33.877 --> 43:36.680
I'm buzzing
to get this party started.

44:01.638 --> 44:01.839
.
