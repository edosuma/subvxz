YEAH, MY FANS
SEEM TO THINK SO.

10:07.000 --> 10:09.400
THEN YOU'RE QUITE
WELL-KNOWN?

10:09.400 --> 10:13.367
BREAKFAST OF ME.

10:13.367 --> 10:16.033
HOW'S IT FEEL TO BE IN
THE PRESENCE OF A LEGEND?

10:16.033 --> 10:18.500
WELL, LEGENDS ARE
NOT BORN OVERNIGHT.

10:18.500 --> 10:20.367
YOU MUST'VE BEEN PLAYING
FOR QUITE A WHILE.

10:20.367 --> 10:22.300
OH, EVER SINCE
THE 11th GRADE.

10:22.300 --> 10:24.367
YOU DIDN'T GRADUATE
HIGH SCHOOL?

10:24.367 --> 10:26.133
HIGH SCHOOL'S
KIND OF A JOKE

10:26.133 --> 10:28.734
WHEN YOU'RE PULLING DOWN
6 MIL A YEAR.

10:28.734 --> 10:29.900
6 MILLION?

10:29.900 --> 10:31.667
HURTS, DOESN'T IT?

10:31.667 --> 10:33.967
WELL, ADJUSTED
FOR INFLATION,

10:33.967 --> 10:36.033
THAT'S A PALTRY SUM
COMPARED TO EVEN

10:36.033 --> 10:39.600
THE AVERAGE BALLPLAYER'S
SALARY TODAY.

10:39.600 --> 10:42.967
BUT I'VE GOT
INVESTMENTS.

10:42.967 --> 10:43.967
SUCH AS?

10:43.967 --> 10:46.100
YOU KNOW,
INVESTMENTS, UH...

10:46.100 --> 10:49.200
BUILDINGS.
BUILDINGS WITH FLOORS

10:49.200 --> 10:50.767
AND PEOPLE IN THEM
DOING STUFF.

10:50.767 --> 10:51.867
I'M DIVERSIFIED.

10:51.867 --> 10:54.300
AND DO YOU HANDLE THESE
INVESTMENTS YOURSELF?

10:54.300 --> 10:56.000
NO. MY GUYS
DO THAT STUFF.

10:56.000 --> 10:57.667
OH, YOU'VE GOT GUYS?

10:57.667 --> 11:00.734
LOTS OF GUYS.
THEY'RE IN MY BUILDINGS.

11:00.734 --> 11:02.800
AND WHAT PERCENTAGE
OF YOUR SALARY

11:02.800 --> 11:04.600
DO THEY CHARGE
FOR THEIR SERVICES?

11:04.600 --> 11:06.967
MR. FEENY, YOU'RE
DRAGGING ME DOWN.

11:06.967 --> 11:09.400
CAN'T WE DISCUSS, LIKE,
MY BATTING AVERAGE?

11:09.400 --> 11:11.600
YOU'RE FLOUNDERING,
MR. MATTHEWS.

11:11.600 --> 11:12.934
NO. I THOUGHT
THIS THROUGH.

11:12.934 --> 11:16.200
LOOK, I EVEN MADE UP
MY OWN BASEBALL CARD.

11:16.200 --> 11:17.467
YET YOU HAVE NO CLUE

11:17.467 --> 11:20.000
AS TO HOW YOUR AFFAIRS
WILL BE MANAGED,

11:20.000 --> 11:22.700
NO EDUCATION
TO HELP YOU GET A CLUE,

11:22.700 --> 11:23.967
AND NO
MARKETABLE SKILLS

11:23.967 --> 11:26.967
AFTER YOUR BALL-PLAYING
DAYS ARE OVER.

11:26.967 --> 11:29.000
BUT I'VE GOT GUYS.

11:29.000 --> 11:30.500
WELL, MR. MATTHEWS,

11:30.500 --> 11:32.734
YOU'VE MADE AN ATTEMPT
AT THIS ASSIGNMENT.

11:32.734 --> 11:34.500
YOU JUST DIDN'T THINK
IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH.

11:34.500 --> 11:35.500
AND UNTIL YOU DO,

11:35.500 --> 11:37.734
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU
AN INCOMPLETE.

11:37.734 --> 11:39.500
AN INCOMPLETE?

11:39.500 --> 11:40.500
MM-HMM.

11:40.500 --> 11:42.300
THAT'S AN "I".

11:42.300 --> 11:44.767
THAT'S LOWER THAN AN "F".

11:44.767 --> 11:47.300
THAT'S DOWN THERE
BY "M".

11:47.300 --> 11:49.500
YOU CAN'T DO THIS.

11:49.500 --> 11:50.734
WHY NOT?

11:50.734 --> 11:51.834
'CAUSE IT'S NOT LIKE
YOU'RE GIVING ME

11:51.834 --> 11:55.300
AN INCOMPLETE ON
SOME DINKY QUIZ.

11:55.300 --> 11:56.300
YOU THREW ME OUT

11:56.300 --> 11:58.200
BEFORE I EVEN GOT
TO FIRST BASE.

11:58.200 --> 12:00.600
YOU TOOK AWAY MY FUTURE.

12:00.600 --> 12:03.100
[SIGHS]

12:06.900 --> 12:09.467
[MUSIC PLAYING]

12:14.667 --> 12:17.967
I'LL MISS YOU, JIM,
BUT YOU SHOULD BE

12:17.967 --> 12:21.467
ON THE WALL OF
A KID WITH A FUTURE.

12:23.000 --> 12:24.033
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

12:24.033 --> 12:26.300
THERE'S NOTHING
OUT THERE FOR ME, ERIC.

12:26.300 --> 12:28.500
THAT'S GREAT, COR, BUT
I'M TRYING TO READ HERE, OK?

12:28.500 --> 12:29.767
WHAT'S THE POINT?

12:29.767 --> 12:30.767
THIS IS THE POINT.

12:30.767 --> 12:32.100
IN 3 YEARS,
I COULD SAVE UP ENOUGH

12:32.100 --> 12:34.100
TO GET ONE OF THESE
VINTAGE MUSTANGS

12:34.100 --> 12:35.934
AND FILL IT WITH
CHEERLEADERS. HA HA!

12:35.934 --> 12:38.500
YEAH? HOW'RE YOU GONNA
PAY FOR THE INSURANCE?

12:38.500 --> 12:40.567
WHAT? I DON'T KNOW.
MAYBE DAD'LL HELP ME.

12:40.567 --> 12:43.000
WHAT IF DAD CAN'T AFFORD
TO HELP YOU, ERIC?

12:43.000 --> 12:45.233
I DON'T KNOW. MAYBE I'LL GET
ANOTHER PART-TIME JOB.

12:45.233 --> 12:47.934
WORK TWO JOBS
<i>AND </i>GO TO SCHOOL.

12:47.934 --> 12:49.600
OH, ERIC, ERIC, ERIC.

12:49.600 --> 12:51.300
YOU'RE NOTHING
BUT A POSEUR.

12:51.300 --> 12:53.967
POSEUR, HUH?
REALLY?

12:53.967 --> 12:57.200
WHAT DO YOU THINK
OF THIS POSE?

12:58.233 --> 13:00.734
HEY, GUYS,
YOU READY FOR DINNER?

13:00.734 --> 13:01.967
UH, NO, BUT
I'LL DO ANYTHING

13:01.967 --> 13:04.367
TO GET AWAY FROM
CAPTAIN BUMMER.

13:04.367 --> 13:07.400
YOUR MOM TOLD ME
ABOUT THE ASSIGNMENT.

13:07.400 --> 13:10.200
IT WASN'T JUST
AN ASSIGNMENT, DAD.

13:10.200 --> 13:11.700
IT WAS MY FUTURE.

13:11.700 --> 13:13.567
I GOT AN INCOMPLETE.

13:13.567 --> 13:15.667
I HAVE AN
INCOMPLETE FUTURE.

13:15.667 --> 13:16.934
OF COURSE YOU HAVE
AN INCOMPLETE FUTURE.

13:16.934 --> 13:18.800
THE FUTURE'S
ALWAYS INCOMPLETE.

13:18.800 --> 13:19.800
WHEN IT'S COMPLETE,

13:19.800 --> 13:22.033
PEOPLE TEND
TO CALL IT THE PAST.

13:22.033 --> 13:24.300
MINE WAS SUPPOSED
TO BE ALL PLANNED OUT.

13:24.300 --> 13:25.734
I THOUGHT YOU WANTED
TO BE A BASEBALL PLAYER?

13:25.734 --> 13:30.200
I DO, BUT THAT'S NOT ENOUGH
FOR FEENY THE DREAM CRUSHER.

13:30.200 --> 13:32.133
I DON'T CARE WHAT
GEORGE FEENY SAYS.

13:32.133 --> 13:33.133
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING

13:33.133 --> 13:36.500
YOU PUT YOUR MIND TO,
CORY, ANYTHING.

13:36.500 --> 13:38.400
MAYBE I'LL GIVE
THESE TO MORGAN.

13:38.400 --> 13:41.600
SHE CAN COLOR IN
JIM ABBOTT'S UNIFORM.

13:41.600 --> 13:43.133
DAD, WHEN YOU WERE A KID,

13:43.133 --> 13:45.100
DID SOMEONE TELL YOU
THAT YOU'D NEVER MAKE IT

13:45.100 --> 13:46.900
TO BEING THE MANAGER
OF A SUPERMARKET?

13:46.900 --> 13:50.500
WELL, THAT WASN'T EXACTLY
WHAT I DREAMED OF BEING.

13:50.500 --> 13:53.033
IT'S NOT? BUT IT'S
SUCH A COOL JOB.

13:53.033 --> 13:54.767
I WANTED
TO BUILD BRIDGES,

13:54.767 --> 13:56.734
BIG ONES, LIKE
THE BEN FRANKLIN.

13:56.734 --> 13:58.934
THEN HOW COME
YOU GAVE THAT UP?

13:58.934 --> 14:00.133
I DON'T KNOW.
SOMETIMES,

14:00.133 --> 14:02.767
AS YOU GET OLDER,
YOUR DREAMS CHANGE.

14:02.767 --> 14:03.800
AFTER A WHILE,

14:03.800 --> 14:05.967
I DREAMED OF HAVING
A WIFE AND A FAMILY,

14:05.967 --> 14:06.967
AND THAT CAME TRUE.

14:06.967 --> 14:08.500
YOU KNOW WHAT
I DREAM OF BEING NOW?

14:08.500 --> 14:09.600
WHAT?

14:09.600 --> 14:11.100
I DREAM OF
BEING THE FATHER

14:11.100 --> 14:12.500
OF A PHILLIES
CENTER FIELDER.

14:12.500 --> 14:16.000
DAD, THERE'S ANOTHER DREAM
YOU CAN KISS GOOD-BYE.

14:16.000 --> 14:17.667
HEY, NOT SO FAST.

14:17.667 --> 14:19.300
I DON'T GIVE UP
THAT EASY.

14:19.300 --> 14:21.934
I STILL THINK MY KID'S GOING
TO PLAY IN THE MAJORS.

14:21.934 --> 14:23.600
I USED TO DREAM
LIKE THAT, DAD,

14:23.600 --> 14:25.467
BUT NOW I KNOW THAT
SOONER OR LATER,

14:25.467 --> 14:26.934
EVERY DREAM
COMES TO AN END

14:26.934 --> 14:29.767
AND YOU GOT
TO WAKE UP.

14:35.800 --> 14:36.967
HELLO, JANE.

14:36.967 --> 14:38.700
HI, STEPHANIE, IT'S NICE
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

14:38.700 --> 14:39.967
WHERE'S MORGAN?

14:39.967 --> 14:40.967
IN THE KITCHEN.

14:40.967 --> 14:42.800
GO AHEAD, SWEETHEART.

14:42.800 --> 14:44.500
I'M GLAD OUR
LITTLE DISAGREEMENT

14:44.500 --> 14:46.367
DIDN'T PREVENT THE KIDS
FROM PLAYING TOGETHER.

14:46.367 --> 14:49.233
WELL, THAT WOULD
BE SELFISH.

14:49.233 --> 14:51.100
WOULD YOU LIKE
SOME COFFEE?

14:51.100 --> 14:53.934
YOU ARE NOT GETTING
THE NECKLACE BACK.

14:53.934 --> 14:55.400
NOW, DON'T
MISUNDERSTAND.

14:55.400 --> 14:57.233
IT'S NOT
THE VALUE OF IT,

14:57.233 --> 14:59.700
IT'S STEPHANIE'S
ATTACHMENT TO IT.

14:59.700 --> 15:00.900
OH, I'M SURE
I DO UNDERSTAND,

15:00.900 --> 15:03.367
AND I HAD NO INTENTION
OF ASKING FOR IT.

15:03.367 --> 15:05.500
IN THAT CASE,
I'LL HAVE SOME COFFEE.

15:05.500 --> 15:08.133
HA HA HA!
OK.

15:08.133 --> 15:11.100
WOW, YOU HAVE
NEAT STUFF.

15:11.100 --> 15:12.233
YES. HERE WE HAVE

15:12.233 --> 15:15.200
MY MOMMY'S DOUBLE
CHOCOLATE BROWNIES.

15:15.200 --> 15:16.567
OOH, BROWNIES!

15:16.567 --> 15:19.367
NOT SO FAST.

15:19.367 --> 15:22.467
AND HERE WE HAVE
A DIAMOND CROWN.

15:22.467 --> 15:23.567
OOH, DIAMONDS.

15:23.567 --> 15:25.600
HOLD YOUR HORSES.

15:25.600 --> 15:28.600
AND SPEAKING OF HORSES...

15:28.600 --> 15:30.700
MY LITTLE PONY.

15:32.667 --> 15:34.467
SO, DO YOU WORK?

15:34.467 --> 15:36.000
OH, NO, I DON'T HAVE TO.

15:36.000 --> 15:39.200
MY HUSBAND'S A VERY
SUCCESSFUL ATTORNEY.

15:39.200 --> 15:40.934
AHH. SO THAT'S WHERE
LITTLE STEPHANIE

15:40.934 --> 15:44.133
GETS HER FLAIR
FOR NEGOTIATIONS.

15:44.133 --> 15:47.000
MOMMY, LOOK,
DIAMONDS!

15:47.000 --> 15:49.200
STEPHANIE,
WHERE'S YOUR DRESS,

15:49.200 --> 15:51.500
AND YOUR HAT,
AND YOUR NECKLACE?

15:51.500 --> 15:52.567
I TRADED THEM.

15:52.567 --> 15:53.667
<i>MY </i>DRESS,

15:53.667 --> 15:57.400
<i>MY </i>HAT,
<i>MY </i>NECKLACE.

15:59.400 --> 16:03.033
YOU TRADED THEM
FOR A PLASTIC TIARA?

16:03.033 --> 16:04.367
AND A BROWNIE.

16:04.367 --> 16:05.600
AND A LITTLE
PINK PONY.

16:05.600 --> 16:08.300
NO. I HAD TO GIVE
HER SOMETHING ELSE

16:08.300 --> 16:09.667
FOR THE PONY.
WHAT?

16:09.667 --> 16:12.967
I'LL BE NEEDING
THE KEYS TO YOUR CAR.

16:12.967 --> 16:14.667
DON'T MISUNDERSTAND.

16:14.667 --> 16:16.300
IT'S NOT THE VALUE
OF THE CAR,

16:16.300 --> 16:20.100
IT'S MORGAN'S
ATTACHMENT TO IT.

16:20.100 --> 16:22.700
LOOK, I'M TELLING YOU,
SHE WAS DOING THE KISSING.

16:22.700 --> 16:25.567
I--I WAS LIKE
AN INNOCENT BYSTANDER.

16:25.567 --> 16:26.734
YES, I COULD'VE
WALKED AWAY,

16:26.734 --> 16:29.133
BUT SHE HAD ME PINNED UP
AGAINST THE LOCKERS.

16:29.133 --> 16:30.133
I MEAN--

16:30.133 --> 16:32.800
BUT--
CALL HER BACK LATER.

16:32.800 --> 16:33.800
ARE YOU CRAZY?

16:33.800 --> 16:35.400
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
WHO THAT WAS.

16:35.400 --> 16:39.133
SHAWN, CALL EVERYONE AND
GET OVER TO MY HOUSE NOW.

16:39.133 --> 16:40.767
JIM ABBOTT'S IN MY KITCHEN.

16:40.767 --> 16:43.200
HA HA HA! JIM ABBOTT?
ARE YOU OUT OF YOUR MIND?

16:43.200 --> 16:44.500
NO, I'M TOTALLY
IN MY MIND.

16:44.500 --> 16:46.900
YEAH, ONE OF THE BEST PITCHERS
IN MAJOR LEAGUE BASEBALL

16:46.900 --> 16:48.100
IS IN OUR HOUSE.
HA HA HA!

16:48.100 --> 16:53.033
GUYS, SOMEBODY HERE
I'D LIKE YOU TO MEET.

17:10.734 --> 17:12.200
CORY, ERIC.

17:12.200 --> 17:15.667
WOULDN'T YOU LIKE
TO MEET JIM ABBOTT?

17:18.000 --> 17:19.467
I GUESS NOT.

17:19.467 --> 17:22.033
AAH!
AAH!

17:22.033 --> 17:23.500
HI, GUYS.
HI.

17:23.500 --> 17:26.100
HOW ARE YOU DOING?
YOU MUST BE CORY.

17:26.100 --> 17:28.300
I'M WHOEVER YOU
WANT ME TO BE.

17:28.300 --> 17:30.567
YOUR DAD'S TOLD ME
A LOT ABOUT YOU.

17:30.567 --> 17:33.800
HE HAS? BUT
HOW DID HE...

17:33.800 --> 17:35.033
HOW DID DAD...

17:35.033 --> 17:37.200
WHY ARE YOU
IN MY HOUSE?

17:37.200 --> 17:38.367
CORY, DON'T BUG THE MAN

17:38.367 --> 17:40.900
WITH A LOT OF
LITTLE-BOY QUESTIONS.

17:40.900 --> 17:44.000
SO, JIM, WHY ARE YOU
IN OUR HOUSE?

17:44.000 --> 17:45.000
WELL, I HEARD THAT CORY HERE

17:45.000 --> 17:46.967
WANTS TO BE IN
THE BIG LEAGUES SOMEDAY.

17:46.967 --> 17:50.000
WHO, ME?
NAH, STUPID IDEA.

17:50.000 --> 17:51.100
I GAVE UP ON THAT.

17:51.100 --> 17:52.800
GUYS LIKE ME DON'T
MAKE IT TO THE MAJORS.

17:52.800 --> 17:55.100
WELL, THERE'S A GUY
I KNOW WHO HAS A SON

17:55.100 --> 17:57.900
WHO ALWAYS DREAMED OF
PLAYING IN THE MAJOR LEAGUES

17:57.900 --> 17:59.500
UNTIL A CERTAIN
TEACHER TOLD HIM

17:59.500 --> 18:02.033
THAT MAYBE IT WASN'T
SUCH A GOOD IDEA.

18:02.033 --> 18:03.834
THIS SOUNDS
FAMILIAR TO ME.

18:03.834 --> 18:06.367
WELL, IT SOUNDED
FAMILIAR TO ME, TOO.

18:06.367 --> 18:07.967
SURE.
IT DID?

18:07.967 --> 18:09.300
ONE TIME I HAD
A HIGH SCHOOL COACH

18:09.300 --> 18:11.367
WHO SAID I SHOULD NEVER
PLAY IN THE MAJOR LEAGUES

18:11.367 --> 18:13.834
AND THAT ONLY MADE ME
WORK 50 TIMES HARDER.

18:13.834 --> 18:15.600
REALLY? YOU EVER GO
BACK TO THAT COACH

18:15.600 --> 18:16.967
AND RUB IT IN HIS FACE?

18:16.967 --> 18:19.834
NAH, JIM'S TOO COOL TO DO
THAT, AREN'T YOU, JIM?

18:19.834 --> 18:20.834
NO, ACTUALLY,

18:20.834 --> 18:24.467
I SENT HIM A VIDEOTAPE
OF MY NO-HITTER.

18:24.467 --> 18:27.200
COOL. I GUESS
YOU SHOWED HIM.

18:27.200 --> 18:28.834
WELL, ACTUALLY,
HE SHOWED ME.

18:28.834 --> 18:30.967
HE SHOWED ME
AN APPLICATION TO A PLACE

18:30.967 --> 18:32.800
CALLED THE UNIVERSITY
OF MICHIGAN.

18:32.800 --> 18:33.867
WHY'D HE DO THAT?

18:33.867 --> 18:35.967
WELL, HE WAS SMART
ENOUGH TO KNOW

18:35.967 --> 18:38.000
THAT IF I DIDN'T MAKE IT
TO THE MAJOR LEAGUES SOMEDAY,

18:38.000 --> 18:39.700
AT LEAST I'D HAVE
A MAJOR LEAGUE EDUCATION.

18:39.700 --> 18:43.500
SO YOU THINK I CAN GET INTO
THE UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN?

18:43.500 --> 18:46.233
I MEAN, NOW THAT I GOT
CONNECTIONS AND EVERYTHING?

18:46.233 --> 18:48.734
I THINK YOU'LL BE
ALL RIGHT, CORY.

18:48.734 --> 18:50.500
YOU GOT ONE BIG THING
GOING FOR YOU.

18:50.500 --> 18:53.400
OH? YOU HEARD ABOUT
HOW WELL I BUNT?

18:53.400 --> 18:56.200
WELL, THAT AND THE FACT
THAT YOU'VE GOT A GREAT DAD

18:56.200 --> 18:58.700
WHO LETS HIS KIDS
HAVE BIG DREAMS,

18:58.700 --> 19:00.066
AND HE'S ALSO
JUST CRAZY ENOUGH

19:00.066 --> 19:04.300
TO SEND A TOTAL STRANGER
63 TELEGRAMS.

19:04.300 --> 19:06.867
GEE, YOU ONLY GOT
63 OF THEM?

19:06.867 --> 19:10.767
YOU DID THAT
FOR ME, DAD?

19:11.834 --> 19:15.200
BUT HOW'D YOU KNOW
HE'D SHOW UP?

19:15.200 --> 19:16.400
I DIDN'T KNOW.

19:16.400 --> 19:20.200
BUT A GUY CAN DREAM,
CAN'T HE?

19:20.200 --> 19:24.300
HEY, JIM, YOU MIND SIGNING
THESE FOR THESE GUYS?

19:24.300 --> 19:26.100
SURE.

19:26.100 --> 19:28.734
ME, TOO!
I WANT ONE, TOO!

19:28.734 --> 19:32.467
APPARENTLY,
I'VE BROUGHT THE WRONG BALL.

19:36.133 --> 19:38.200
MATTHEWS GOES BACK DEEP.

19:38.200 --> 19:40.967
HE'S ON HIS HORSE!
HE'S AT THE WALL!

19:40.967 --> 19:43.100
THAT BALL IS...

19:44.133 --> 19:45.133
GONE.

19:45.133 --> 19:47.800
COME ON, MR. FEENY,
PLEASE.

19:47.800 --> 19:49.300
YOU KNOW THE RULES.

19:49.300 --> 19:50.934
YOU START RESPECTING
MY PROPERTY LINE,

19:50.934 --> 19:52.834
AND I'LL START RESPECTING
YOUR PROPERTY.

19:52.834 --> 19:56.767
YES, SIR. MR. FEENY,
I JUST WANT YOU TO KNOW

19:56.767 --> 19:57.800
I MADE UP MY MIND

19:57.800 --> 19:59.767
AND I'M GOING TO BE
A BASEBALL PLAYER.

19:59.767 --> 20:00.834
IS THAT SO?

20:00.834 --> 20:02.400
YEAH. BECAUSE A FRIEND
OF MY DAD'S--

20:02.400 --> 20:04.000
I DON'T WANT
TO DROP ANY NAMES--

20:04.000 --> 20:07.100
SO LET'S JUST CALL HIM
JIM ABBOTT--

20:07.100 --> 20:10.500
WELL, JIM AND I AND
MY DAD HAD A LITTLE TALK

20:10.500 --> 20:12.700
AND WE STRAIGHTENED OUT
MY WHOLE FUTURE.

20:12.700 --> 20:13.834
YOU DID?

20:13.834 --> 20:15.367
YEP, I'M GOING TO BE
IN THE MAJOR LEAGUES,

20:15.367 --> 20:17.233
MR. FEENY,
NO MATTER WHAT YOU SAY.

20:17.233 --> 20:20.767
BUT JIM AND MY DAD--
AND WHEN I SAY JIM--

20:20.767 --> 20:21.967
YOU MEAN JIM ABBOTT.

20:21.967 --> 20:24.033
I'M SAYING!

20:25.300 --> 20:27.500
WELL, THEY SAY THAT MAYBE
I SHOULDN'T TURN PRO

20:27.500 --> 20:28.800
UNTIL AFTER COLLEGE.

20:28.800 --> 20:31.233
SO YOU'VE CHANGED YOUR PLANS
AND INTEND TO GRADUATE?

20:31.233 --> 20:33.567
YEAH. 'CAUSE I'M GOING
TO MAKE A NAME FOR MYSELF

20:33.567 --> 20:36.000
PLAYING COLLEGE BALL
BEFORE I TURN PRO.

20:36.000 --> 20:37.000
JUST LIKE JIM DID.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.500
SEEMS LIKE THIS
ABBOTT FELLOW

20:38.500 --> 20:41.200
HAD HIS FUTURE
VERY WELL-PLANNED

20:41.200 --> 20:43.200
AND WORKED HARD
TO GET WHERE HE IS.

20:43.200 --> 20:45.834
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
HOW HARD, MR. FEENY.

20:45.834 --> 20:48.867
WELL, YOU DID BETTER
THAN I EXPECTED,

20:48.867 --> 20:51.233
AND I GUESS YOU
DESERVE SOMETHING.

20:51.233 --> 20:53.500
IS THIS YOUR LITTLE WAY
OF TELLING ME

20:53.500 --> 20:55.734
YOU'RE CHANGING
MY INCOMPLETE TO AN "A"?

20:55.734 --> 20:58.667
NO. THIS IS MY LITTLE
WAY OF SAYING...

20:58.667 --> 21:01.100
PLAY BALL!

21:10.967 --> 21:12.600
[TELEVISION PLAYING]

21:12.600 --> 21:16.200
WHY DO WOMEN
GO ON THESE SHOWS?

21:16.200 --> 21:17.200
YOU SEE THE GUY

21:17.200 --> 21:19.400
WITH THE RIPPED JEANS
AND THE TIGHT BUTT?

21:19.400 --> 21:20.900
YEAH.

21:20.900 --> 21:22.934
THAT'S WHY.

21:22.934 --> 21:26.867
DOES IT EVER BOTHER YOU
THAT I NEVER BUILT BRIDGES?

21:26.867 --> 21:28.100
WHAT?

21:28.100 --> 21:30.767
I NEVER BECAME
AN ENGINEER.

21:30.767 --> 21:32.567
DOES IT BOTHER YOU?

21:32.567 --> 21:33.734
ONCE IN A WHILE.

21:33.734 --> 21:36.200
YOU THINK YOU
MARRIED A FAILURE?

21:36.200 --> 21:40.000
YOU'VE GOT A REALLY GOOD JOB
WHERE PEOPLE RESPECT YOU.

21:40.000 --> 21:42.900
YOU HAVE THREE
BEAUTIFUL CHILDREN

21:42.900 --> 21:46.300
WHO ARE FAST ASLEEP
IN THEIR LITTLE BEDS,

21:46.300 --> 21:48.033
AND YOU HAVE A WIFE

21:48.033 --> 21:50.233
WHO HAS ABSOLUTELY
NOTHING TO DO

21:50.233 --> 21:52.100
FOR THE NEXT HALF HOUR.

21:52.100 --> 21:56.600
SO WHAT ARE
YOU SAYING, HMM?

22:02.000 --> 22:04.600
MOM, DAD.

22:07.133 --> 22:09.500
<i>COULD YOU DO</i>
<i>SOMETHING INTERESTING?</i>

22:09.500 --> 22:10.767
<i>THIS KISSING STUFF</i>

22:10.767 --> 22:13.600

<i>MY AUDIENCE'S ATTENTION.</i>

22:13.600 --> 22:15.033
IT WAS HOLDING
MY ATTENTION

22:15.033 --> 22:16.600
UNTIL THE NEWS CREW
SHOWED UP.

22:16.600 --> 22:19.000
<i>COME ON, GUYS.</i>
<i>THIS IS TELEVISION.</i>

22:19.000 --> 22:20.233
<i>HOW ABOUT A LITTLE ACTION?</i>

22:20.233 --> 22:22.800
OH, OK. YOU WANT ACTION?
HOW ABOUT A CHASE SCENE?

22:22.800 --> 22:23.800
