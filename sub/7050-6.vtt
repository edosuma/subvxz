00:02.127 --> 00:03.503
Previously on Justified...

00:03.586 --> 00:04.671
I got a surprise for you.

00:06.340 --> 00:07.423
Arnold's a furry.

00:07.508 --> 00:08.633
He gonna press charges?

00:08.717 --> 00:10.885
He's the judge/executive.
What's he gonna do?

00:11.178 --> 00:12.887
Ellen May. What are you doing here?

00:13.222 --> 00:15.473
Girl looked me in the face,
talking about she knows things.

00:15.724 --> 00:17.600
I never should've
left a witness, what we done.

00:17.685 --> 00:18.768
It'll be quick, Ava.

00:19.353 --> 00:22.230
I saw a sheriff's car on the security tape.

00:22.314 --> 00:24.065
One of my deputies was there last night.

00:24.233 --> 00:26.109
- Which way did they go?
- That, I don't know.

00:26.235 --> 00:28.736
Boyd and Ava intended that man to kill you.

00:28.904 --> 00:31.280
You must know something
that could hurt him real bad.

00:31.490 --> 00:33.241
You and your boyfriend went into Arlo's.

00:33.325 --> 00:34.659
Who told you the bag would be there?

00:34.743 --> 00:35.868
Josiah sent us.

00:35.953 --> 00:37.870
All right, fine. I'll tell you where he's at.

00:37.955 --> 00:39.163
The hills, huh?

00:39.248 --> 00:41.332
If ol' Drew's still alive,
that's where you'll find him.

00:41.417 --> 00:44.043
Only time I seen him
since he left was near 10 years ago

00:44.128 --> 00:48.339
at the bluegrass festival, rubbing shoulders
with the mayor, judge/executive.

00:48.424 --> 00:49.966
All them rich Clover Hill folks.

00:50.050 --> 00:52.301
I expect I have your man Drew
within the week.

00:52.428 --> 00:53.970
That's impressive work, Mr Crowder.

00:54.054 --> 00:58.850
The new price for Drew is, I get half the
heroin business in the state of Kentucky.

00:59.017 --> 01:00.810
- You have a deal.
- I thought we had a deal.

01:00.936 --> 01:02.937
Once he brings me Drew, he and I are done.

01:03.021 --> 01:04.230
And you're free to kill him.

01:04.313 --> 01:06.858
Josiah! It's Raylan Givens.

01:08.277 --> 01:09.694
Well, my goodness.

01:14.116 --> 01:18.119
Please. My son's asleep upstairs.

01:19.246 --> 01:21.372
Then we should talk quietly.

01:21.999 --> 01:24.000
Where's your wife, Dale?

01:24.084 --> 01:26.252
On vacation.

01:27.004 --> 01:28.504
No, she moved out.

01:28.589 --> 01:31.924
Just going through a rough patch.

01:32.009 --> 01:34.260
You mean to tell me that all rich people

01:34.344 --> 01:37.180
don't live in a constant state
of domestic bliss?

01:40.434 --> 01:44.187
Well, you got
a lot of pretty things in this house, Dale.

01:44.271 --> 01:45.938
What do you do for a living?

01:46.148 --> 01:48.316
Banking, up Cumberland.

01:49.276 --> 01:50.443
You go to school for that?

01:50.778 --> 01:53.112
No, just learn by doing.

01:53.280 --> 01:55.531
- You're a self-made man?
- I guess.

01:56.033 --> 01:59.035
Well, that's something we have in common.

01:59.119 --> 02:02.205
Well, Dale, if you want to continue

02:02.289 --> 02:04.791
to enjoy the fruits of your labour,

02:06.168 --> 02:08.669
I'm gonna need you to tell me your real name.

02:09.338 --> 02:11.631
I told you. It's Dale Haywood.

02:12.299 --> 02:13.966
You got my driver's license.

02:14.051 --> 02:17.220
Yeah, the thing is,
driver's license, birth certificate, IDs,

02:17.304 --> 02:20.723
they don't mean much these days,
technology being what it is.

02:20.974 --> 02:23.976
If you don't believe my ID,
how am I supposed to prove it?

02:24.061 --> 02:26.813
Well, that's your problem, Dale. Not mine.

02:30.317 --> 02:34.362
Okay, now, I swear
what you want's in that box, right there.

02:36.073 --> 02:37.740
- What is this?
- What...

02:38.242 --> 02:40.326
That there's nothing. Just...

02:40.744 --> 02:44.413
"And as I watch her kiss Curt,
my heart fills with hurt.

02:44.498 --> 02:49.710
"My soul fills with sorrow
the size of Kilimanjaro."

02:49.795 --> 02:51.379
Holy shit.

02:51.463 --> 02:52.547
Why, you a poet, Dale?

02:52.631 --> 02:55.299
No, I just dabbled in high school.

02:55.425 --> 02:59.136
Look, there's...
Let me find it for you, just some proof.

03:01.473 --> 03:03.307
Wait. Look there. There.

03:03.433 --> 03:05.268
There's it. All right? All right?

03:05.686 --> 03:07.979
1982 Kentucky State Champion.

03:08.522 --> 03:09.730
Well, I do my math right,

03:09.815 --> 03:11.816
that makes you
a 20-year-old high school senior.

03:12.985 --> 03:15.611
Well, yeah, I failed third grade.

03:15.696 --> 03:16.904
And sixth.

03:16.989 --> 03:18.155
Well, that explains the poetry.

03:19.783 --> 03:21.784
Well, you gonna kill me?

03:21.952 --> 03:23.327
No, Dale, I am not.

03:23.662 --> 03:27.081
In fact,
I'd like to apologise for ruining your day,

03:27.165 --> 03:29.083
but I bet you hadn't gotten as rich as you are

03:29.167 --> 03:30.793
without ruining a lot of people's days,

03:31.003 --> 03:34.505
so I'm sure you'll be able
to forgive my transgression.

03:36.216 --> 03:40.177
You may want
to keep that memory box close at hand.

03:40.512 --> 03:43.890
You never know when somebody else
might want to drop by and reminisce.

03:49.730 --> 03:53.107
Treated a guy once. Got his foot caught
in some mining machinery.

03:53.191 --> 03:54.317
But nothing like this.

03:54.401 --> 03:56.152
What do you mean? What kind of machine?

03:56.236 --> 03:58.279
You know, one of them things.

03:58.363 --> 03:59.488
It was a messy bit of business.

03:59.698 --> 04:02.491
How long could
a guy survive losing blood like that?

04:02.659 --> 04:05.036
With a tourniquet, cauterise the wound,
maybe through the night,

04:05.162 --> 04:07.288
but I wouldn't give much more than that.

04:07.372 --> 04:09.457
Hey, guys, you ready to put a BOLO on him

04:09.541 --> 04:11.042
and get KSP and locals on it?

04:11.168 --> 04:12.335
Waste of time, you ask me.

04:12.419 --> 04:13.878
What is? Doing your job?

04:14.004 --> 04:16.088
Hell, all we know,
the asshole might've done it to himself.

04:17.007 --> 04:18.716
You have reason to believe
he'd be that desperate?

04:19.009 --> 04:21.385
What do marshals want
with a piece of shit like Josiah for, anyway?

04:21.511 --> 04:22.553
He owes us money.

04:22.679 --> 04:24.847
You show up here
in the middle of the night and find a foot,

04:24.932 --> 04:26.641
sounds like something special to me.

04:26.725 --> 04:29.518
- I think he might have info on a fugitive.
- Which fugitive?

04:29.895 --> 04:31.020
Jimmy Hoffa.

04:31.563 --> 04:32.855
Is there any particular reason

04:32.940 --> 04:35.066
you're treating us
like a couple of bleached assholes?

04:35.192 --> 04:36.776
Not in particular, no.

04:36.860 --> 04:37.944
What's up, Art?

04:38.028 --> 04:40.154
Well, I hear you're having
an interesting morning.

04:40.238 --> 04:41.405
Tim tell you I wasn't coming in?

04:41.698 --> 04:43.783
Yes, he did. Said the game was afoot.

04:44.076 --> 04:45.701
Here we go.

04:45.911 --> 04:48.287
I'm sure you'll keep putting
your best foot forward.

04:48.372 --> 04:49.580
Do what needs to be done.

04:49.748 --> 04:51.207
That why you called? Foot puns?

04:51.375 --> 04:53.709
Yes, actually. Yes, it is. It's the only reason.

04:54.086 --> 04:55.503
Any luck delaying Arlo's deal?

04:55.587 --> 04:58.214
No. Sonya Gable hasn't returned our calls.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.423
Why's that?

04:59.549 --> 05:01.592
I suspect she knows
that we're trying to delay the deal.

05:01.802 --> 05:03.260
Why the hell would she delay the deal?

05:03.387 --> 05:04.428
Well, I don't know, Raylan.

05:04.554 --> 05:07.390
After you finish playing footsie,
why don't you go ask her?

05:07.474 --> 05:08.975
Shit!

05:09.226 --> 05:10.685
Jesus Christ, man. Watch it.

05:10.769 --> 05:11.852
I got to go.

05:11.937 --> 05:13.896
This here's what we call
a crime scene, Wilson.

05:13.981 --> 05:15.356
Thanks for the heads-up.

05:15.440 --> 05:16.565
What is that?

05:17.609 --> 05:18.776
My footprint?

05:18.902 --> 05:20.653
No, not that. That.

05:34.334 --> 05:35.501
Hello, Roz.

06:14.791 --> 06:16.792
Shit. Come on!

06:17.002 --> 06:18.836
Are you positive he ain't Drew?

06:18.962 --> 06:20.588
Well, Dale's guilty of a few things, I'm sure,

06:20.672 --> 06:23.466
living up in Clover Hill,
but being Drew Thompson ain't one of them.

06:24.801 --> 06:27.803
Baby, would you please
come over here and have a seat?

06:28.680 --> 06:29.889
And where the hell is Colt?

06:29.973 --> 06:31.849
What's taking him so long? Colton!

06:31.975 --> 06:33.017
Just a minute!

06:33.143 --> 06:34.268
So, what's next?

06:34.352 --> 06:35.978
Well, you and me gonna ride out

06:36.063 --> 06:38.022
and have us a conversation
with Harvey Jones,

06:38.148 --> 06:40.858
get the names of the men
up in Clover Hill that fit the profile.

06:41.026 --> 06:42.902
And then what?
We're just gonna put a gun to the head

06:42.986 --> 06:44.111
of every old man lives in Clover Hill?

06:44.196 --> 06:45.529
Well, if that's what I choose to do, Johnny,

06:45.655 --> 06:46.697
then that's what we gonna do.

06:47.240 --> 06:50.910
Baby, would you please just stop cleaning?

06:50.994 --> 06:53.996
If we want an in to Clover Hill,
we could just go to Arnold.

06:54.247 --> 06:56.082
Arnold ain't gonna give us anything

06:56.166 --> 06:58.709
that a gun to the head
won't give us a whole lot faster.

06:59.711 --> 07:03.589
And if we do find Drew, you really think that
Duffy's gonna honour the deal?

07:03.924 --> 07:05.382
Well, you have reason
to believe that he won't?

07:06.093 --> 07:09.595
Well, if it were me,
I'd take Drew off your hands

07:09.679 --> 07:11.055
and then I'd try to kill you.

07:11.556 --> 07:13.182
Well, then, lucky for me it ain't you.

07:13.350 --> 07:14.725
Now, go find out what's taking him so long.

07:24.861 --> 07:25.945
Give me a minute!

07:26.404 --> 07:27.571
You think Johnny's right?

07:27.906 --> 07:30.783
I just need to find Drew Thompson,

07:30.867 --> 07:33.661
and then I'll worry about Wynn Duffy.

07:33.745 --> 07:36.205
I just want to make sure
you don't get hurt, Boyd.

07:38.792 --> 07:40.292
Baby, ain't nothing gonna happen to me.

07:44.089 --> 07:46.632
Hey, do you love me?

07:47.551 --> 07:49.385
Then trust me.

07:50.387 --> 07:54.223
Now, this bird in the hand
is gonna be worth 10 in the bush.

07:59.229 --> 08:00.980
I said give me a goddamn minute!

08:08.947 --> 08:10.573
- The hell you burning there?
- A match.

08:11.241 --> 08:12.908
What are you, the bathroom monitor?

08:12.993 --> 08:14.827
Next time, I'll leave you a present.

08:15.912 --> 08:19.373
Well, I done told you not to eat that
Huevos rancheros for breakfast.

08:19.457 --> 08:22.042
Now, listen to me.
I need you to head over to Audrey's,

08:22.127 --> 08:23.919
and any of them
Clover Hill types over 50 come in,

08:24.004 --> 08:25.254
I want you to give me a call.

08:25.338 --> 08:26.922
- You understand?
- Got it.

08:27.090 --> 08:28.174
Baby.

08:28.800 --> 08:30.009
Come on, Cousin Johnny. Let's go.

08:31.094 --> 08:32.344
Are you okay?

08:33.179 --> 08:34.929
I'm good.

08:52.115 --> 08:53.199
Benny.

08:54.618 --> 08:58.329
Great. It's the man in the hat.

08:58.663 --> 08:59.955
The hell do you want?

09:00.040 --> 09:01.540
Just keep that thing pointed down.

09:01.625 --> 09:03.042
You gonna shoot me if I don't?

09:03.126 --> 09:04.585
Be within my rights to.

09:04.669 --> 09:06.295
What are we playing here?
Cowboys and Indians?

09:06.463 --> 09:08.005
I ain't playing anything.

09:08.131 --> 09:09.340
What the hell do you want?

09:09.466 --> 09:10.507
Where's your girlfriend at?

09:10.967 --> 09:12.301
She ain't my girlfriend any more.

09:12.385 --> 09:13.469
I don't care if she left you.

09:13.553 --> 09:14.803
I just want to know where she's at.

09:14.888 --> 09:16.513
Just said I don't know.

09:16.640 --> 09:18.682
- So? Call her.
- You call her.

09:22.145 --> 09:24.647
Take out your phone and call her.

09:24.731 --> 09:26.315
Marshal Givens!

09:26.691 --> 09:27.816
I have a word, please?

09:27.901 --> 09:29.443
I'm in the middle of something.

09:29.527 --> 09:31.028
You got a phone, don't you?

09:31.363 --> 09:33.322
Take it out. Let your fingers do the walking.

09:33.406 --> 09:34.740
I'm not doing shit.

09:34.824 --> 09:36.033
Now get the hell away from me.

09:38.495 --> 09:41.705
I see I'm gonna get the same
deferential treatment you gave my deputies.

09:41.998 --> 09:43.582
- You got a line on Roz?
- I'm working on it.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.125
Yeah, how's that going for you?

09:45.210 --> 09:47.169
I'm dealing with a love-scorned teenager.

09:47.671 --> 09:49.505
You draw this, Benny?

09:49.923 --> 09:51.799
You want, I'll sell it to you.

09:51.883 --> 09:53.592
You can hang it up over your shitter.

09:53.677 --> 09:55.511
Well, it's not really my taste.

09:56.054 --> 09:57.680
Lacks a little in composition,

09:57.764 --> 09:59.974
but you sure got the likeness right.

10:00.058 --> 10:01.809
You coming?
Or you want to stick around here

10:01.893 --> 10:03.519
and push a kid around some more?

10:11.903 --> 10:14.571
Teddy. This is Marshal Givens.

10:15.365 --> 10:16.740
We're looking for Roz.

10:19.035 --> 10:22.538
Yea high, braces,
hit puberty about six months ago.

10:24.916 --> 10:26.583
You speak English, Teddy?

10:27.752 --> 10:28.877
Good.

10:29.045 --> 10:31.547
You mind if we come inside,
make sure she's not here?

10:33.216 --> 10:38.387
That nod means yes,
you do mind or yes, we may come inside?

10:40.557 --> 10:43.309
Okay, look, I'm gonna come inside.

10:44.144 --> 10:47.896
All right! I'm here! Christ!

10:51.067 --> 10:52.401
Go ahead and let them in.

10:57.615 --> 10:59.992
Don't mind, I'm gonna just hang on to that.

11:05.790 --> 11:07.583
Sorry if we're interrupting something.

11:07.959 --> 11:10.336
I didn't have no goddamn sex with Teddy.

11:10.420 --> 11:13.672
No, I'm sure you and
Rapes-With-A-Smile here were just talking.

11:13.757 --> 11:15.758
What, did you come here
to stab me in the foot again?

11:15.925 --> 11:17.509
Well, at least I ain't gonna chop it off.

11:17.969 --> 11:19.595
I don't even know what you mean.

11:19.929 --> 11:21.013
Hey!

11:22.932 --> 11:24.683
God damn you!

11:25.101 --> 11:26.185
He does speak English.

11:26.853 --> 11:28.520
I will cut you assholes!

11:28.688 --> 11:31.148
Right. For now,
just scoot your ass over there.

11:35.612 --> 11:37.571
You're gonna be stupid enough
to step in blood,

11:37.655 --> 11:39.698
least be smart enough to wash it off after.

11:39.783 --> 11:41.992
So I was there! It ain't like I chopped him!

11:42.160 --> 11:43.786
You see who did?

11:45.497 --> 11:46.663
Roz, we're trying to help him.

11:46.831 --> 11:48.540
Yeah, well, we can find him on our own.

11:48.625 --> 11:49.708
How's that?

11:49.793 --> 11:51.085
Teddy here's part Cherokee.

11:51.169 --> 11:53.504
Family came here on the Trail of Tears.

11:53.838 --> 11:55.130
- Is that right?
- Yeah.

11:55.340 --> 11:56.465
We're gonna find who did this,

11:56.549 --> 12:00.094
and when we do,
we ain't gonna arrest him, like you will.

12:00.178 --> 12:03.430
Well, it's gonna be tough tracking anyone

12:03.515 --> 12:05.974
with Teddy in jail for statutory rape.

12:06.142 --> 12:07.226
I already told you.

12:07.310 --> 12:08.852
Repeating a lie don't make it true.

12:10.438 --> 12:12.564
Now, I've already seen you half-naked,

12:12.649 --> 12:14.983
so it won't be tough to convince a jury

12:15.110 --> 12:18.946
that we walked in on the two of you
making sweet underage love.

12:19.989 --> 12:21.156
There was two of them.

12:21.366 --> 12:22.533
Could you tell what they look like?

12:22.659 --> 12:24.159
No, not really.

12:24.327 --> 12:27.496
On account of Josiah made me hide
the second he saw them pull up.

12:28.164 --> 12:29.498
What else?

12:30.291 --> 12:32.334
They was in a panel van.

12:33.378 --> 12:34.878
Painted up ugly as shit.

12:35.130 --> 12:36.672
Anything else?

12:37.507 --> 12:40.300
I don't know. There was a lot of screaming.

12:40.468 --> 12:42.719
I couldn't make most of it out.

12:44.055 --> 12:45.389
Even called him by the wrong name.

12:45.849 --> 12:46.974
Remember it?

12:47.058 --> 12:48.475
Yeah, I'll never forget it.

12:48.560 --> 12:52.896
'Cause that was the last thing
I heard before Josiah started screaming.

12:53.022 --> 12:54.690
And I saw that they had chopped him.

12:54.816 --> 12:55.899
What was it?

12:59.028 --> 13:00.195
"Drew."

13:01.698 --> 13:02.865
"Drew Thompson."

13:10.415 --> 13:11.832
Drew Thompson.

13:11.916 --> 13:13.041
Name mean something to you?

13:13.418 --> 13:16.044
Ain't nobody in Harlan
name doesn't mean something to.

13:16.379 --> 13:17.546
But Drew's dead.

13:17.672 --> 13:19.047
Well, maybe she heard it wrong.

13:19.174 --> 13:21.675
Yeah, and maybe somebody
thinks he's still alive.

13:21.759 --> 13:25.179
Maybe that's why
you went to see Josiah in the first place.

13:25.263 --> 13:27.598
Shelby, I appreciate your help finding Roz.

13:27.724 --> 13:28.765
I'll see you down the road.

13:29.267 --> 13:31.435
You headed to Boyd Crowder's?

13:33.897 --> 13:36.732
Now, why don't we just cut the shit, Marshal?

13:38.234 --> 13:40.569
Now, you won't talk to me or my deputies

13:40.695 --> 13:42.362
'cause you think I'm in Boyd's pocket.

13:42.447 --> 13:44.198
I think Lynyrd Skynyrd's overrated.

13:44.282 --> 13:45.782
I know you're in Boyd's pocket.

13:45.950 --> 13:49.786
I used Boyd to get into office,
but my loyalty's to the law.

13:50.205 --> 13:53.248
You understand
if I call bullshit and be on my way.

13:53.583 --> 13:55.042
I'm afraid I won't.

13:56.419 --> 14:01.548
Now, if Drew Thompson is alive and
in Harlan, that is a story for the ages.

14:01.925 --> 14:04.051
But the only thing I know for certain

14:04.135 --> 14:07.262
is that Josiah Cairn
is a parolee gone missing,

14:07.388 --> 14:09.598
making it my responsibility to find him.

14:10.141 --> 14:15.062
Now, your Drew Thompson
agenda aside, I brought you to Roz.

14:15.146 --> 14:19.900
If you think you got a line on what happened
to Josiah, you're gonna share it with me.

14:21.444 --> 14:23.320
You gonna say "please"?

14:27.617 --> 14:30.077
I'm so sorry, man. Meeting went long.

14:30.161 --> 14:31.787
Glad you're still going to meetings.

14:31.913 --> 14:33.038
How's your leg?

14:33.122 --> 14:35.874
Well, Doc says I need one more surgery.

14:35.959 --> 14:37.793
Pins pinch like hell.

14:37.961 --> 14:39.586
Tramadol helps some, but I got to tell you,

14:39.671 --> 14:41.797
much as oxy screwed up my life,
it sure knocked out the pain.

14:42.173 --> 14:43.465
You try acupuncture?

14:43.591 --> 14:44.967
That needle bullshit?

14:45.093 --> 14:46.134
You remember Chewy,

14:46.261 --> 14:49.346
that CSAR Helo pilot
pulled us out of Sangin, karaoke badass?

14:49.681 --> 14:51.848
- Yeah.
- Said it helped him with his back.

14:52.183 --> 14:53.934
Maybe help you with
your menstrual cramps, then.

14:54.018 --> 14:56.019
Nah, those went away
once I got on birth control.

14:56.688 --> 14:58.605
I appreciate you coming.

14:58.690 --> 14:59.898
Well, look, I got your message.

14:59.983 --> 15:02.067
I thought maybe you slipped up again.

15:02.151 --> 15:05.112
Nah. Nah, man, I'm good. Two months now.

15:06.698 --> 15:08.323
Okay. So what...

15:08.783 --> 15:09.866
But I need your help.

15:10.368 --> 15:11.785
I still have some debts from my user days.

15:11.995 --> 15:13.704
Shit, Mark. You know I really
don't have that much cash...

15:13.830 --> 15:14.997
No, no, I don't want it.

15:15.123 --> 15:16.164
It's my debt, and I'll pay it.

15:16.291 --> 15:18.709
I was more hoping you might come with me.

15:19.002 --> 15:20.794
It'll only take 15 minutes. I promise.

15:22.338 --> 15:23.380
All right.

15:23.881 --> 15:26.300
- Shit, brother, I owe you one.
- It's okay.

15:26.384 --> 15:28.802
I love a good excuse
to show off the biceps anyway.

15:28.886 --> 15:31.555
Hold on. Hey, Boyd Crowder's ride.

15:33.558 --> 15:36.560
Hey. Marshal Givens' sidekick.

15:37.395 --> 15:38.729
You here for a check-up?

15:39.230 --> 15:40.772
Yeah, I got a

15:40.857 --> 15:43.317
Bagram lung.

15:43.401 --> 15:45.569
Didn't know the doctors
took appointments this late.

15:45.695 --> 15:47.863
Yeah, it's a courtesy for the after-work crowd.

15:48.990 --> 15:50.741
All right, well, you look after yourself.

15:56.039 --> 15:59.249
I know those eyes.
That guy's in a world of hurt.

16:15.892 --> 16:17.267
You got a problem?

16:17.393 --> 16:19.353
I'm looking for a dealer.

16:19.437 --> 16:21.438
Man, I'm clean.

16:21.731 --> 16:23.774
I'm not trying
to get involved in nothing like that.

16:24.233 --> 16:25.776
Jesus Christ, man.

16:25.902 --> 16:28.403
Betcha that dick just got a lot smaller, huh?

16:29.072 --> 16:30.364
I can find you a dealer.

16:30.448 --> 16:31.573
You got a picture or something?

16:31.699 --> 16:33.408
No picture. Just any dealer.

16:33.534 --> 16:34.826
He just has to be from here.

16:34.911 --> 16:36.620
Okay, okay. What are you looking to score?

16:36.746 --> 16:38.747
Heroin. It's got to be heroin.

16:41.084 --> 16:42.542
Oh, shit.

16:42.627 --> 16:43.960
Hold it.

16:46.130 --> 16:48.298
Come on. God damn it.

16:50.426 --> 16:51.551
You were saying?

16:51.636 --> 16:53.136
You and Johnny get the name?

16:53.262 --> 16:55.430
We did narrow them down to 13 men.

16:55.556 --> 16:58.558
Soon as Colton gets back from Audrey's,
we're gonna go knocking on doors.

16:58.768 --> 17:01.144
Well, I got another idea,
if you'd like to hear it.

17:01.646 --> 17:03.563
Well, I'm all ears.

17:03.773 --> 17:05.398
Napier's place.

17:05.483 --> 17:07.317
He has them parties every week,
and we can go.

17:07.443 --> 17:09.444
Baby, I don't mean to sound rude,

17:09.569 --> 17:12.906
but how do you think
we're gonna get into Napier's party?

17:12.990 --> 17:14.825
He'd shoot me before I got through the door.

17:15.159 --> 17:17.743
Not if we use Arnold to get us an invite.

17:18.413 --> 17:21.248
Unless his wife wants to hear
about his more peculiar tendencies.

17:21.915 --> 17:24.291
Do you know what happens
up at these parties?

17:25.127 --> 17:26.795
It's a swingers' party, not a whorehouse.

17:26.921 --> 17:29.089
I know I can handle myself.

17:29.173 --> 17:31.883
Baby, all them Clover Hill boys
are gonna be there.

17:31.968 --> 17:34.302
You can talk to them
real friendly-like, all at once.

17:34.429 --> 17:36.304
Ava, we don't fit in up there.

17:37.014 --> 17:40.350
I'll put on my little red dress,
and we'll fit in just fine.

17:43.020 --> 17:44.521
Well, Shelby, I believe it's customary

17:44.647 --> 17:46.815
to knock before you walk into a room.

17:46.941 --> 17:49.025
Well, you want me
to go back out and come back in again?

17:49.152 --> 17:52.779
No, I want you
to go back out and then go back out.

17:52.864 --> 17:54.281
We're in the middle of something here.

17:54.532 --> 17:55.615
Well, it's gonna have to wait,

17:55.700 --> 17:56.992
'cause I need you to come with me.

17:57.160 --> 17:58.994
Did you not hear what I just said?

17:59.203 --> 18:00.620
I ain't asking, Boyd.

18:07.545 --> 18:08.712
Excuse me?

18:10.214 --> 18:12.340
Don't worry about that gun. It ain't loaded.

18:12.842 --> 18:16.052
Well, I didn't figure you'd
shoot me in front of her, anyway.

18:16.179 --> 18:17.387
Now, I need you to turn around,

18:17.722 --> 18:19.347
put your hands behind your back.

18:19.474 --> 18:21.391
Hold on, Shelby. You arresting him?

18:21.517 --> 18:22.976
That's what it looks like, isn't it?

18:23.060 --> 18:24.186
On what charge?

18:24.312 --> 18:25.771
He'll find out soon enough.

18:25.855 --> 18:29.149
Son, you are turning a corner
that you can't walk back around.

18:29.734 --> 18:33.069
Well, that's like warning a man
it's gonna rain when he's already wet.

18:33.196 --> 18:34.321
Now, let's go.

18:54.217 --> 18:56.092
The hell are you doing?

18:57.428 --> 18:58.553
Hey.

19:00.097 --> 19:01.223
Maybe I'm looking for you.

19:02.266 --> 19:03.892
Expecting to find me under the bed?

19:04.393 --> 19:05.894
You got a smart mouth.

19:06.562 --> 19:07.854
What else can you do with that mouth?

19:08.773 --> 19:11.441
I'm a professional. I do it all.

19:13.444 --> 19:17.113
How about you go get Ellen May

19:18.199 --> 19:20.242
and the three of us have a good time?

19:20.368 --> 19:22.202
Ellen May? She's gone.

19:22.286 --> 19:24.079
Yeah, I know, but...

19:25.414 --> 19:26.790
I think you know where she is.

19:26.916 --> 19:28.708
How should I know?
I haven't seen her in days!

19:28.793 --> 19:30.669
She has been back here! You're lying to me!

19:30.753 --> 19:32.921
- I ain't lying!
- Bullshit!

19:37.552 --> 19:39.052
Jesus! Hey!

19:39.136 --> 19:41.721
You want a freebie,
you ain't got to wreck my shit to get it.

19:47.937 --> 19:49.688
- Damn it!
- I don't know where Ellen May is,

19:49.772 --> 19:51.523
and your smacking me around
ain't gonna change that!

19:51.607 --> 19:52.983
Okay, hey.

19:54.443 --> 19:56.486
How about any of the other girls, huh?

19:56.779 --> 19:58.405
You think maybe they know where she is?

19:58.489 --> 20:00.282
Not that I know of.

20:00.908 --> 20:04.619
Hey, listen, I'm not a bad person.

20:05.413 --> 20:06.580
No.

20:08.249 --> 20:09.332
You believe me, don't you?

20:11.335 --> 20:12.752
Okay, good.

20:13.421 --> 20:14.963
Oh, God!

20:16.173 --> 20:17.674
You tell anyone about this,

20:19.176 --> 20:20.677
I will cut out your tongue.

20:22.138 --> 20:24.472
And then we're gonna see
what kind of professional you are.

20:29.478 --> 20:31.438
You want to tell me what this is about?

20:31.522 --> 20:33.273
'Cause I ain't laughing.

20:36.861 --> 20:40.697
Well, he says he was
playing checkers with his grandma.

20:40.823 --> 20:43.867
Well, now, that's before
I realised you two were acquainted.

20:43.993 --> 20:46.202
Well, we're just getting to know one another.

20:47.830 --> 20:48.997
How long were you up there for?

20:49.290 --> 20:52.459
Well, I thought it might take Colton
a little while to find a saw,

20:52.543 --> 20:54.961
so I decided to eat my way through the tree.

20:55.046 --> 20:57.005
Call your deputies.

20:57.131 --> 20:59.132
Have them check
Josiah's foot for teeth marks.

20:59.216 --> 21:00.342
His foot?

21:00.551 --> 21:01.927
That's all we found of him.

21:02.011 --> 21:03.136
So far.

21:04.138 --> 21:06.139
Let me get this straight.

21:06.223 --> 21:08.850
You brought me in here
to ask if I cut up Josiah

21:08.976 --> 21:12.520
when you know
that I spent all night handcuffed to a tree,

21:12.647 --> 21:15.023
freezing my goddamn ass off?

21:15.232 --> 21:17.484
Well, maybe not you, but one of your guys.

21:17.985 --> 21:19.319
You know, my mama always told me

21:19.403 --> 21:23.490
a man who couldn't keep his word
wasn't much of a man at all.

21:23.574 --> 21:24.824
Now, given our history, Shelby,

21:24.909 --> 21:26.993
I'm wondering
what kind of man that makes you.

21:27.078 --> 21:28.703
The kind whose mama raised him

21:28.829 --> 21:30.497
so's he could look
in the mirror in the morning

21:30.581 --> 21:32.624
and not hate what he saw looking back.

21:32.708 --> 21:36.086
Well, how did that man feel
when he was a greeter at a big-box store?

21:36.212 --> 21:37.837
Ouch. That's a shitty job.

21:37.922 --> 21:40.924
Before the Academy,
I worked cleaning bathrooms in dive bars.

21:41.050 --> 21:43.259
I used to work for
a crime-scene cleanup crew.

21:43.386 --> 21:44.469
Think you got me beat.

21:44.553 --> 21:47.597
Well, as much as I'd like to participate
in writing your occupational resumes,

21:47.723 --> 21:49.015
I've got somewhere I got to be.

21:49.100 --> 21:50.517
Now, you want to take these handcuffs off

21:50.601 --> 21:52.852
or do you want me to pick them,
like I did the last set?

21:52.937 --> 21:54.229
Sit your ass down. We ain't done yet.

21:54.355 --> 21:56.398
Well, I'm done with you, Shelby.

21:57.066 --> 21:59.192
Now, you don't want to talk about Josiah,

21:59.527 --> 22:02.278
maybe there's some other case
you don't want to talk about.

22:02.405 --> 22:04.614
Maybe a missing-persons case.

22:04.740 --> 22:05.865
Whore worked for you.

22:06.450 --> 22:07.701
Sweet girl.

22:07.785 --> 22:10.453
Got wrapped up
in that church you had me investigate.

22:11.580 --> 22:13.248
Ellen May. Yeah.

22:14.291 --> 22:16.334
I haven't seen her lately.

22:16.419 --> 22:18.795
You do something to Ellen May, Boyd?

22:19.547 --> 22:21.214
I liked Ellen May.

22:23.092 --> 22:28.471
All right, just so you're clear in your head,
Raylan, I did not kill Josiah Cairn.

22:28.597 --> 22:29.764
You're saying he's dead?

22:31.475 --> 22:34.352
Boyd, if you know something
we don't, say it.

22:34.437 --> 22:36.896
You said the man got his foot cut off?

22:36.981 --> 22:40.316
So if he hasn't already met his maker,
he's well on his way.

22:40.651 --> 22:42.819
Joining all his other asshole friends.

22:43.821 --> 22:46.072
That's what assholes do, Raylan.

22:46.157 --> 22:49.159
They get old and die from being assholes.

22:49.285 --> 22:53.163
But while they're alive,
they got the right to be alive.

22:54.123 --> 22:55.915
Unless somebody says they don't.

22:59.503 --> 23:01.046
- What are the charges?
- Well, would you look at that.

23:01.130 --> 23:02.505
My lawyer, right on cue.

23:02.631 --> 23:03.673
You're Arlo's lawyer.

23:03.799 --> 23:06.384
Somebody had to provide your daddy
with representation.

23:06.469 --> 23:08.636
Because if he's not under arrest,
we're leaving right now.

23:09.305 --> 23:10.472
Get those handcuffs off of him.

23:10.639 --> 23:11.890
Why are you stalling the deal?

23:11.974 --> 23:13.099
Excuse me?

23:13.184 --> 23:16.019
AUSA says they've
reached out to you on Arlo's deal,

23:16.145 --> 23:17.187
but they haven't heard back.

23:17.313 --> 23:18.646
I don't know what you're talking about.
Come on.

23:19.190 --> 23:21.191
You boys have a nice day.

23:29.950 --> 23:31.159
Teri.

23:36.540 --> 23:38.041
No. Hey, hey.

23:39.376 --> 23:41.336
- What the hell happened?
- It's nothing.

23:41.462 --> 23:42.504
Who did this to you?

23:42.630 --> 23:43.713
I can still work.

23:43.839 --> 23:44.964
I don't care about that.

23:45.049 --> 23:46.674
What I care about is that eye swelling shut.

23:46.884 --> 23:48.009
It was a customer.

23:50.221 --> 23:51.471
Which customer?

23:51.722 --> 23:52.931
Can't say.

23:53.015 --> 23:54.557
No, you can, and you will.

23:55.184 --> 23:56.434
It ain't that big a deal.

23:56.519 --> 23:57.852
Yes, it is.

23:57.978 --> 24:01.898
I got to make sure that this asshole
knows that he is not welcome here.

24:05.236 --> 24:06.361
Teri.

24:10.866 --> 24:12.367
It was Max.

24:13.077 --> 24:14.702
My Tuesday-night regular.

24:21.710 --> 24:24.045
Could I get another blanket?

24:26.924 --> 24:30.009
Listen, I know your friends are telling you

24:30.094 --> 24:32.220
that you're gonna get paid off for this deal,

24:32.888 --> 24:34.597
but I am not who they think I am.

24:34.723 --> 24:36.474
Shut up, old man.

24:37.143 --> 24:40.019
Can't you see I got
a pair of scissors in my hand?

24:40.104 --> 24:42.355
Well, it's official.

24:42.439 --> 24:44.190
That shit ain't coming out.

24:44.275 --> 24:46.109
Ruined my goddamn van.

24:46.944 --> 24:48.236
What the hell are you doing?

24:48.320 --> 24:49.404
What's it look like?

24:49.488 --> 24:52.991
Looks like you're getting toenails
all over my goddamn garage floor.

24:53.075 --> 24:54.450
Now, cut it out.

24:54.577 --> 24:55.827
You need to calm down, bro.

24:56.078 --> 24:59.205
You cut a man's foot off, ruin my van,
you want me to calm down?

24:59.290 --> 25:00.748
The tether would've brought the cops.

25:01.125 --> 25:03.960
Hey! Y'all need me alive, don't you?

25:04.086 --> 25:05.670
Get me some goddamn water.

25:05.754 --> 25:08.965
You're a criminal. How do you get
bloodstains out of upholstery?

25:10.176 --> 25:11.342
Oh, shit.

25:11.760 --> 25:12.844
He don't look so good.

25:12.928 --> 25:14.387
'Course I don't look so good.

25:14.471 --> 25:15.722
I'm dying here, asshole.

25:15.806 --> 25:18.766
I thought you said
the belt was gonna stop the bleeding!

25:20.019 --> 25:21.769
Just get me to a hospital!

25:21.979 --> 25:23.813
Oh, shit.

25:24.607 --> 25:25.773
It's bleeding bad.

25:25.941 --> 25:29.152
Look, he don't live, we don't get paid.

25:32.448 --> 25:34.115
You best hope that don't happen.

25:37.494 --> 25:40.038
Well, I'm not the one
who took an axe to the man's leg.

25:40.122 --> 25:43.041
And if I'd have known
you'd turned into a bona fide psychopath

25:43.125 --> 25:44.250
with all that time in the joint,

25:44.335 --> 25:45.752
I wouldn't have asked you to help out.

25:45.836 --> 25:48.129
Well, if I had known
you'd turned into a bona fide pussy,

25:48.214 --> 25:49.297
I wouldn't have said yes.

25:49.381 --> 25:50.924
You two want to be any louder?

25:51.008 --> 25:54.052
I don't think the whole
neighbourhood heard you. How is he?

25:54.136 --> 25:57.597
Not good. How far away are your guys?

25:57.681 --> 25:58.932
Half-hour at least.

25:59.016 --> 26:00.975
We got to stop the bleeding.
He ain't gonna make it.

26:01.060 --> 26:02.685
I can get some bandages.

26:02.853 --> 26:06.522
Blowtorch. Blowtorch will stop it.

26:07.816 --> 26:09.317
We're not using a blowtorch.

26:09.526 --> 26:11.152
- Why not?
- Because I wanted to retire

26:11.237 --> 26:14.948
on a beach somewhere and not take
an open flame to a man's leg.

26:15.032 --> 26:19.661
Look, maybe it's time we start thinking
about cutting bait here, you know?

26:23.999 --> 26:28.586
I don't get paid, I'm gonna kill you both
and take my cut out of you.

26:28.671 --> 26:30.463
You understand me?

26:30.547 --> 26:32.340
- Yeah.
- Good.

26:32.591 --> 26:35.677
Now go get the goddamn torch.

26:51.110 --> 26:53.403
April, honey? You home?

26:56.573 --> 26:57.991
Is dinner...

26:58.075 --> 27:00.910
Hey, Arnold. This here's Ava Crowder.

27:01.036 --> 27:03.121
Honey, you didn't say we had company.

27:03.455 --> 27:06.916
Mr Judge/Executive.
It is a pleasure to meet you.

27:07.376 --> 27:08.626
Likewise.

27:08.919 --> 27:10.503
Well, Ava and I went to high school together.

27:10.587 --> 27:11.963
Well, not exactly together.

27:12.047 --> 27:14.257
I mean, April's a few years older.

27:14.383 --> 27:15.591
You sure don't look it.

27:16.969 --> 27:18.094
You don't know this,

27:18.220 --> 27:20.763
but you're one of the girls
inspired me to become a cheerleader.

27:20.889 --> 27:22.724
Ain't that nice?

27:23.309 --> 27:24.976
Ava's up here putting together
a memory book

27:25.060 --> 27:26.728
for the high school cheer squad.

27:26.812 --> 27:28.104
We've been reliving the good old days.

27:28.230 --> 27:29.314
Yeah.

27:29.398 --> 27:31.149
- Remember...
- Oh, yeah!

27:31.233 --> 27:33.318
Go Wildcats!

27:34.903 --> 27:35.945
Go, indeed.

27:36.613 --> 27:38.281
I'm definitely gonna use this one.

27:38.782 --> 27:42.160
Little teddy bear in the Wildcat jersey.

27:42.619 --> 27:43.870
Isn't that cute?

27:43.954 --> 27:45.121
That's not you, is it, Arnold?

27:45.831 --> 27:47.081
No, it is not.

27:48.459 --> 27:51.961
You know, I would love to look through
these lovely pictures of my wife, as well.

27:52.087 --> 27:53.755
April, honey, do me a favour.

27:53.839 --> 27:55.757
Go grab my reading glasses from upstairs.

27:55.841 --> 27:57.008
Yeah, sure. I'll be right back.

27:57.301 --> 27:58.926
Thanks, darling.

28:00.596 --> 28:01.888
The hell are you doing here?

28:01.972 --> 28:03.765
Now, Arnold, be nice.

28:03.974 --> 28:06.142
No reason to let them bear claws come out.

28:06.977 --> 28:08.811
Tell me what you want.

28:09.438 --> 28:12.732
I want you to get me and Boyd an invite

28:12.816 --> 28:14.484
to Napier's party tomorrow night.

28:14.610 --> 28:18.279
Unless you want me to tell your wife
about your fondness for wildlife.

28:20.991 --> 28:23.201
Hell, girl.

28:24.119 --> 28:27.413
All you want is an invitation to the party?

28:27.498 --> 28:28.956
You could've just asked.

28:29.375 --> 28:31.125
Don't have to threaten me for that.

28:31.210 --> 28:32.335
Shit.

28:32.544 --> 28:34.045
Well, what about Boyd?

28:34.129 --> 28:35.797
Can't imagine that's gonna be easy.

28:36.131 --> 28:38.007
Women are probably gonna like him.

28:38.675 --> 28:41.344
Guys will be giving up their left nuts
just to get a shot at you.

28:42.012 --> 28:43.179
I meant Napier.

28:43.680 --> 28:45.640
I'll handle Napier.

28:45.849 --> 28:47.934
You just consider yourself invited, okay?

28:48.018 --> 28:49.477
Both of you.

28:50.020 --> 28:51.354
- Okay.
- All right.

29:25.597 --> 29:27.223
What the hell you think that was about?

29:27.558 --> 29:28.808
I got a vague notion.

29:28.892 --> 29:30.226
You see the license plate?

29:30.352 --> 29:31.394
It was a rental.

29:31.895 --> 29:33.312
I bet if you check the rental agreement,

29:33.397 --> 29:35.398
you'll get a Detroit credit card.

29:39.611 --> 29:41.529
He's gonna struggle.
You two need to hold him down.

29:41.613 --> 29:43.573
I'm actually feeling a whole lot better now.

29:43.699 --> 29:44.740
I can't be part of this.

29:44.867 --> 29:47.869
Hey, hey, hey!
You're gonna do it, or you're next.

29:48.287 --> 29:49.537
- Now grab his arms.
- No!

29:49.746 --> 29:51.706
- You grab his legs.
- No! No!

29:51.790 --> 29:53.374
Just hold his damn leg.

29:53.876 --> 29:56.252
I swear I am not Drew Thompson.

29:56.378 --> 29:57.503
That's not what Arlo Givens says.

29:57.588 --> 29:59.964
Well, Arlo Givens is a lying sack of shit!

30:00.090 --> 30:01.549
You two done yet?

30:07.806 --> 30:09.724
Back off! Get away from him right now!

30:10.100 --> 30:11.225
Back away!

30:11.435 --> 30:13.728
You turn that off right now.

30:15.147 --> 30:16.230
Stop it!

30:16.398 --> 30:17.482
Are you kidding me?

30:21.403 --> 30:22.945
Jesus!

30:26.450 --> 30:27.700
What the hell was that?

30:32.206 --> 30:33.789
You picked a couple winners here, darling.

30:34.082 --> 30:35.166
Which one's your client?

30:35.250 --> 30:37.418
- The dumb one.
- That don't narrow it down.

30:38.837 --> 30:40.171
Hell of a day, huh, Josiah?

30:40.464 --> 30:41.631
Call an ambulance.

30:41.715 --> 30:43.466
Says the man who tried to kill me.

30:43.800 --> 30:45.009
Well, I can explain that.

30:45.093 --> 30:47.553
I'm surprised this brush with death
has not given you

30:47.638 --> 30:49.639
a greater appreciation
for living in the moment.

30:50.390 --> 30:52.600
Well, I ain't Drew,
if that's what you're wondering about.

30:53.810 --> 30:54.936
I figured as much.

30:55.437 --> 30:58.731
Arlo would never tell Sonya who Drew was
without his deal being in place.

30:58.815 --> 31:01.526
Still, you tried to send me to my death,
and I'd like you to tell me why.

31:02.736 --> 31:05.154
I figured I'd get rid of you

31:05.239 --> 31:08.950
and find Drew myself
and get out of that damn tether.

31:09.701 --> 31:11.494
Well, you got out of the tether.

31:13.330 --> 31:14.580
How were you gonna find him?

31:16.458 --> 31:18.167
This fella I used to know.

31:19.878 --> 31:21.921
Former lawman from Harlan.

31:23.465 --> 31:25.424
If Drew was hiding here, he'd know.

31:25.551 --> 31:26.801
What lawman?

31:26.927 --> 31:31.347
You ought to know.

31:32.182 --> 31:35.351
He's in jail for trying to have you killed.

31:40.357 --> 31:42.066
Hunter and me were deputies together.

31:42.568 --> 31:44.110
I never did care for him much.

31:44.194 --> 31:45.278
Man tried to have me killed.

31:45.362 --> 31:47.029
How do you think I feel about him?

31:47.114 --> 31:48.739
Well, let me know if I can help.

31:48.824 --> 31:50.741
Thanks. I appreciate that.

31:51.660 --> 31:53.953
When was the last time you shot somebody?

31:54.037 --> 31:55.538
Well, it's been a while, actually.

31:55.706 --> 31:58.207
- You?
- About 20 years.

31:59.042 --> 32:01.919
I was on my way
to meet my girlfriend at the Dairy Queen.

32:02.004 --> 32:03.379
I was gonna propose to her.

32:03.922 --> 32:08.009
Kid in a truck cut me off at the light,
so I followed him instead.

32:08.343 --> 32:10.636
I got him cornered in a parking lot,

32:10.721 --> 32:13.639
yelled at him to get the hell out of his truck.

32:13.724 --> 32:17.768
Unbeknownst to me,
he's robbed a liquor store in Lynch.

32:17.853 --> 32:20.146
He ain't gonna do nothing I say.

32:20.230 --> 32:25.651
So, the son of a bitch hit the gas,
come flying at me.

32:25.736 --> 32:27.194
Truck hits me in the legs.

32:27.279 --> 32:29.196
I go flying in the air.

32:29.448 --> 32:32.575
Got one shot off. Hit him square in the chest.

32:35.078 --> 32:37.163
Maybe I could use your help.

32:37.956 --> 32:42.084
Well, wasn't always a greeter
in a big-box store.

32:43.754 --> 32:45.171
That thing on Ellen May,

32:45.255 --> 32:47.214
you really got something on her missing?

32:47.299 --> 32:48.758
I can't remember.

32:48.842 --> 32:50.676
Having fun with me now.

32:50.761 --> 32:54.347
Well, spent most of my years
as a lawman chasing your daddy.

32:54.431 --> 32:56.766
How do I know
his tendencies ain't been passed down?

32:56.850 --> 32:57.933
Fair enough.

32:58.018 --> 33:00.936
That notwithstanding,
you got something on Boyd,

33:01.021 --> 33:02.480
my advice, tell someone quick.

33:02.564 --> 33:05.608
After today,
he's coming after you sooner than later.

33:06.026 --> 33:08.027
Appreciate the warning, Raylan.

33:09.946 --> 33:12.323
- You ever marry that girl?
- No.

33:12.866 --> 33:15.451
And I put flowers
on that kid's grave every week.

33:20.374 --> 33:22.249
Got to be shitting me.

33:25.420 --> 33:27.463
You got balls of steel, showing up like this.

33:27.589 --> 33:30.132
I'm just here to resolve our issue.

33:31.635 --> 33:33.719
- Who's he?
- I'm just a friend.

33:34.805 --> 33:35.888
You want to let us in,

33:35.972 --> 33:38.307
or you want to discuss drug deals
out here on your porch?

33:44.064 --> 33:46.315
Come on, come on. Get out. Get out!

33:50.028 --> 33:51.112
Hey, hey! Hey, hey!

33:51.196 --> 33:52.321
- Oh, yeah.
- Where you going?

33:52.406 --> 33:54.407
You know the drill. Hey!

33:56.284 --> 33:58.577
- Dude.
- Everybody strips comes in here.

33:59.579 --> 34:02.081
Only way I can be sure
you ain't wearing a wire.

34:02.165 --> 34:03.541
And that I'm the only one packing.

34:03.959 --> 34:05.418
Sorry, man. I should've warned you.

34:05.669 --> 34:08.420
You take them off, or we're gonna
have a major problem on our hands.

34:08.505 --> 34:10.089
Look, we're not here to score.

34:10.172 --> 34:11.757
We're just here to work out Mark's debt.

34:11.882 --> 34:14.552
Debt? That what he told you?

34:14.719 --> 34:18.389
Well, last time
I saw this piece of shit, he ripped me off.

34:18.473 --> 34:20.266
Eight hundred bucks.

34:20.350 --> 34:22.560
- And a bottle of oxys.
- What the hell, man?

34:22.643 --> 34:24.603
Hey, hey, all right.
Everybody just calm down.

34:24.688 --> 34:26.438
Okay, last time I was here, I was high

34:26.523 --> 34:27.648
and I took some things that weren't mine,

34:27.733 --> 34:30.150
but that's why I'm here now.
To make things right.

34:30.235 --> 34:31.610
You want to make things right?

34:31.695 --> 34:33.529
Well, then you gonna
give me double what you stole.

34:33.612 --> 34:34.697
- Hey, man.
- Mark.

34:36.158 --> 34:37.241
Fine.

34:37.868 --> 34:38.993
Thing is, I don't have it right now.

34:39.119 --> 34:40.244
Do not say that to me.

34:40.328 --> 34:41.786
I can get part of it to you by next week.

34:41.871 --> 34:44.748
I hate it when people say that, all right?

34:45.958 --> 34:48.918
Good thing I never took my pants off, huh?

34:49.004 --> 34:51.380
Now, Mark's trying to make things
right with you. You need to let him.

34:51.465 --> 34:54.300
It's just gonna take you a little longer
to settle up than you might've hoped.

34:55.385 --> 34:58.846
Well, patience might be a virtue,
but waiting sucks.

34:58.930 --> 35:00.306
Well, I agree with that.

35:00.390 --> 35:01.515
But getting your money and living

35:01.600 --> 35:04.351
is better than getting shot, don't you think?

35:05.520 --> 35:07.271
Now, what do you say we lower our guns

35:07.355 --> 35:09.565
at the same time as a show of faith?

35:15.947 --> 35:17.782
How about a show of good faith,

35:17.866 --> 35:20.659
Mark here gives me a down payment?

35:20.744 --> 35:22.286
Everything he's got on him right now.

35:22.370 --> 35:24.079
- No chance.
- Mark.

35:24.539 --> 35:25.790
You heard the man.

35:27.083 --> 35:28.209
- I got to pay my rent...
- Hand it over to him.

35:28.293 --> 35:29.418
I will shoot you myself.

35:34.758 --> 35:36.592
Hey, Robbie, get in here.
You got to see this, man.

35:39.304 --> 35:40.471
You Max?

35:42.140 --> 35:43.265
Yeah.

35:43.350 --> 35:44.475
Turn that shit off.

35:44.559 --> 35:45.684
The hell are you?

35:47.813 --> 35:49.522
- Hey, man!
- Get up.

35:49.856 --> 35:51.440
Teri, the girl you see on Tuesdays?

35:53.026 --> 35:54.360
How's that any of your business?

35:54.444 --> 35:57.029
Well, as a matter of fact,
Teri is literally my business.

35:57.113 --> 35:58.280
She works for me.

35:58.365 --> 35:59.490
So? I pay her.

35:59.783 --> 36:02.117
Even bring her flowers from the store
when I got a mind to remember.

36:02.702 --> 36:03.828
You must've had a screw loose,

36:03.912 --> 36:05.704
thinking you could
toss her around and not hear about it.

36:05.789 --> 36:08.415
Who you think you are, come in here,
interrogate me like I'm in Gitmo?

36:08.500 --> 36:10.167
- Get the hell out of here.
- No, son.

36:10.252 --> 36:13.128
Now, see, this is where we tell you
what to do, not the other way around.

36:13.463 --> 36:14.630
Get on your knees.

36:15.298 --> 36:16.423
What, he didn't finish sucking you off?

36:20.428 --> 36:21.554
I didn't do nothing!

36:22.889 --> 36:24.557
Now, here's how it is.

36:24.724 --> 36:27.560
You go and hit one of the girls, you hit us.

36:27.644 --> 36:30.563
And we, we are gonna hit you back
with a vengeance.

36:30.647 --> 36:32.064
I didn't do it, man.

36:34.943 --> 36:36.902
No, please! I didn't hit nobody!

36:43.243 --> 36:44.451
Please...

36:45.245 --> 36:46.412
No!

36:46.496 --> 36:47.788
No more, please.

36:50.917 --> 36:52.501
All right, all right, all right! Lesson learned!

36:55.171 --> 36:56.755
Don't kill him, Colt! Jesus!

36:58.008 --> 37:00.134
- That's for hitting a girl.
- God damn.

37:00.594 --> 37:02.845
- Hey, check his pulse.
- Check it yourself.

37:09.019 --> 37:10.519
I'm glad you're still here.

37:12.188 --> 37:14.106
Colton and Johnny had to run an errand.

37:15.817 --> 37:17.359
Well, I'm assuming you're in that dress

37:17.444 --> 37:19.612
'cause you want me
to go with you up to Arnold's.

37:19.821 --> 37:20.946
Already went.

37:21.573 --> 37:24.116
And we are invited
to Napier's house tomorrow night.

37:25.869 --> 37:27.578
Arnold even seemed happy to have us.

37:28.997 --> 37:30.372
Okay, baby.

37:31.416 --> 37:32.875
We'll try it your way.

37:33.752 --> 37:36.045
I'm struggling here, Boyd.

37:40.383 --> 37:43.218
You asked me earlier if I loved you.

37:45.180 --> 37:46.597
You know the answer to that's yes.

37:48.475 --> 37:51.602
Now, I didn't lose any sleep over Devil.

37:52.520 --> 37:54.897
Certainly not Delroy.

37:57.817 --> 37:59.860
But Ellen May being in the ground,

38:01.279 --> 38:02.571
it's tearing me apart.

38:04.366 --> 38:05.824
Ava, she could've destroyed us.

38:05.951 --> 38:07.076
I know.

38:09.621 --> 38:12.331
Doesn't keep me from seeing her face
every time I close my eyes.

38:15.418 --> 38:18.337
I have and I will
do anything for you, Boyd Crowder.

38:21.591 --> 38:23.008
But if we're gonna continue down this road,

38:23.093 --> 38:24.635
I got to know where we're headed.

38:35.438 --> 38:37.648
You meet me in that truck in two minutes.

38:38.775 --> 38:39.942
- Boyd, I...
- Baby.

38:42.070 --> 38:43.278
Please.

38:46.491 --> 38:47.616
Okay.

39:04.467 --> 39:06.093
My mama,

39:06.177 --> 39:09.221
she used to bring me up here
when I was a little boy.

39:09.305 --> 39:11.974
And I would look out at these lights,

39:12.058 --> 39:14.143
pretend that they were stars.

39:14.477 --> 39:16.061
I'd step in my spaceship

39:16.396 --> 39:18.439
and just float through the universe.

39:20.775 --> 39:23.902
It wasn't long before somebody run us off.

39:23.987 --> 39:25.988
We weren't really welcome up here.

39:36.082 --> 39:37.666
That your spaceship?

39:38.001 --> 39:39.418
It's awful small.

39:40.253 --> 39:41.712
It's for you.

39:42.088 --> 39:44.381
Answer to your question from earlier.

39:53.683 --> 39:54.892
That's a lot of money.

39:54.976 --> 39:58.020
I've been stashing away
for the last few months.

39:58.313 --> 40:00.522
I hated to hide it from you. I've just

40:01.441 --> 40:03.734
been waiting for the time to be right.

40:03.818 --> 40:04.902
Right for what?

40:04.986 --> 40:07.112
It's a down payment on a house, Ava.

40:07.197 --> 40:08.822
Anywhere you want it.

40:09.824 --> 40:12.659
Maybe it'll even be
a place with a view like this.

40:13.369 --> 40:15.412
Boyd...

40:15.497 --> 40:17.873
This is why we're doing
the things we're doing.

40:18.374 --> 40:19.958
It's for the future.

40:20.210 --> 40:21.460
Three generations' time,

40:21.544 --> 40:23.378
we'll be an old family name.

40:23.671 --> 40:27.382
Won't nobody think twice
about their kid and a Crowder kid

40:27.467 --> 40:28.967
playing together after school.

40:29.052 --> 40:31.386
Kids? What are you saying?

40:32.097 --> 40:33.555
Look underneath.

40:44.317 --> 40:48.529
I know this ain't exactly
how most people do it,

40:50.240 --> 40:51.990
professing their love over a box of cash,

40:52.158 --> 40:55.369
but the way I see it,
Ava Crowder, you and me,

40:58.164 --> 41:00.290
well, we ain't like most people.

41:00.708 --> 41:02.668
No, we ain't.

41:03.503 --> 41:04.628
Ava...

41:05.672 --> 41:06.880
The love of my life,

41:08.174 --> 41:09.466
the apple of my eye,

41:11.970 --> 41:13.053
will you marry me?

41:13.721 --> 41:14.805
God, yes.

41:17.350 --> 41:19.101
Baby, it's the other hand.
