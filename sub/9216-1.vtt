<i>I don't believe in heaven.</i>

00:30.694 --> 00:32.662
<i>I believe in pain.</i>

00:33.797 --> 00:35.765
<i>I believe in fear.</i>

00:37.034 --> 00:39.007
<i>I believe
in death.</i>

00:57.454 --> 00:59.922
<i> There's an army of bodies</i>
<i>under this river-</i>

01:00.024 --> 01:04.723
<i>criminals, people who ran</i>
<i>out of time, out of friends.</i>

01:14.238 --> 01:18.607
<i>Next time they drag this river, they'll find me</i>
<i>on the bottom with the rest of them.</i>

01:18.709 --> 01:21.200
<i>There won't be anyone left</i>
<i>to say I was different.</i>

01:38.395 --> 01:40.420
<i>I could feel the dead</i>
<i>down in there...</i>

01:40.531 --> 01:42.522
<i>just below my feet...</i>

01:42.633 --> 01:45.466
<i>reaching up to welcome me</i>
<i>as one of their own.</i>

01:49.306 --> 01:51.638
<i>It was an easy mistake to make.</i>

02:07.591 --> 02:11.391
<i> All the cold investigations</i>
<i>in the city are collected up...</i>

02:11.495 --> 02:13.759
and delivered over here to us.

02:13.864 --> 02:18.801
We call each of the witnesses to see if they
have anything to add to their original statements.

02:18.902 --> 02:21.467
And if they can?

02:21.468 --> 02:24.033
We send the file to the original
precinct for follow-up.

02:25.609 --> 02:28.601
Don't get your hopes up though.

02:33.817 --> 02:35.717
This is the Cold Case office.

02:35.819 --> 02:39.949
Once you've been through the file
and come up empty, you bring it here.

02:40.057 --> 02:43.220
<i>Max here handles all our files.</i>

02:43.327 --> 02:46.922
It hits his desk,
the case is officially dead.

02:47.031 --> 02:48.999
So what if there's no phone number
for a witness?

02:49.099 --> 02:52.068
- Should I follow-up in person?
- No, no. We don't do that kind of stuff down here.

02:52.169 --> 02:53.761
I don't understand.
Then how-

02:53.871 --> 02:57.363
How am I supposed to solve the unsolvable
murder mystery and redeem yourself?

02:57.474 --> 03:01.137
<i>- Man, Internal Affairs-</i>
<i>- Look, look, stop. All right, trust me.</i>

03:01.245 --> 03:06.308
There's a tragic story behind why
I'm standin' here givin' you this tour.

03:06.417 --> 03:09.215
We all did something,
so just save it.

03:14.591 --> 03:17.025
What do you say we grab a beer
after work or something?

03:27.037 --> 03:29.528
- So what's his story?
- There is none.

03:30.574 --> 03:32.565
- But back there you said-
- Listen.

03:32.676 --> 03:37.238
His wife and kid were murdered.
They never found the guy.

03:37.347 --> 03:40.009
That's his story.

03:40.117 --> 03:45.111
Remember when you were a kid and you'd hold
your breath when you went past a graveyard?

03:45.222 --> 03:48.157
Just, uh, leave that man alone.

05:37.467 --> 05:39.367
Yo, homey,
that's a really nice watch.

05:39.469 --> 05:42.632
Kinda reminds me of one I lost.

05:44.975 --> 05:48.934
Oh, you didn't lose it. You pawned it
up on 128th a few hours ago.

05:50.314 --> 05:52.612
Ask Doug. He was there with you.

05:56.820 --> 05:58.720
Are you followin' us, asshole?

05:58.822 --> 06:00.722
No.

06:02.659 --> 06:04.786
I'm only following you.

06:04.895 --> 06:07.830
Aw, hell, no.
What, you a cop or somethin'?

06:10.567 --> 06:12.467
Not tonight.

06:12.569 --> 06:15.936
That's too bad.
Now go get my watch.

06:18.008 --> 06:21.842
Come on, Dougie.
Come get his watch.

06:29.386 --> 06:32.355
I guess this ain't
your lucky day, now, is it?

06:40.197 --> 06:41.323
Whoa!

06:52.709 --> 06:54.973
No! No! No!

07:03.954 --> 07:05.854
<i>Watch over me.</i>
<i>Watch over me.</i>

07:05.956 --> 07:07.617
Watch over me. Watch over me.

07:07.724 --> 07:09.817
- Watch over me. Watch over me.
- Open your eyes. Now!

07:09.926 --> 07:12.793
- Oh, Jesus.
- Have you ever seen this woman?

07:14.131 --> 07:16.565
- No.
- You got busted robbing a house in New Jersey...

07:16.667 --> 07:18.567
with William Preston
six months ago.

07:18.669 --> 07:22.230
- Bill's dead.
- Why the hell do you think I'm talkin' to you?

07:22.339 --> 07:23.755
Did you ever hear anyone say
anything about this woman?

07:23.756 --> 07:25.172
Bill died-

07:25.275 --> 07:27.175
Bill died 'cause their wings
couldn't lift him up.

07:27.277 --> 07:30.371
No, he got shot robbing a liquor store.
What are you talking about?

07:30.480 --> 07:32.243
Their wings are gold, Max.
They just look black. Feathers-

07:32.244 --> 07:34.007
Get up!

08:26.821 --> 08:28.755
- All right. All right.
- Hey, buddy.

08:30.583 --> 08:31.811
Man, I told you not to come here.

08:33.519 --> 08:35.419
William Preston was a dead end.

08:35.520 --> 08:38.081
I am done helping you, Max.

08:38.190 --> 08:41.626
I paid my debt to society,
you know?

08:41.727 --> 08:44.958
l- I've cooperated enough, man.

08:45.064 --> 08:47.089
Okay?

08:47.199 --> 08:49.099
What's goin' on in there?

08:49.201 --> 08:51.431
What? It's a dinner party.
Okay?

08:51.537 --> 08:53.596
I'm a little offended
I didn't get my invitation.

08:53.706 --> 08:57.836
I didn't send out invita-
Look, I told you. Go find Bill's partner.

08:57.943 --> 09:00.434
I did. Dougie only wanted to talk
about birds or something.

09:00.546 --> 09:02.707
He was a whack job.
Now I need a new name.

09:02.815 --> 09:04.806
- Well, I'm outta ideas then!
- Hey, baby.

09:04.917 --> 09:07.750
- Okay. What- Not now, bitch!
- Asshole!

09:07.853 --> 09:11.584
Look, okay? I told you.
I don't know those kinds of people now.

09:11.690 --> 09:13.715
<i>I've moved up in the world, Max.</i>

09:13.826 --> 09:16.818
- Yeah, I can see that.
- Yeah. Th-Th-This is a dinner party.

09:16.929 --> 09:19.625
<i>All right? These are my friends.</i>
<i>Do you remember friends?</i>

09:19.732 --> 09:22.292
Listen. If you don't give me a new name...

09:22.401 --> 09:24.995
I'm gonna start frisking
every one of your friends.

09:25.104 --> 09:27.937
<i>Three years on the street</i>
<i>is a lifetime, man.</i>

09:28.040 --> 09:31.032
<i>Whoever you're lookin' for,</i>
<i>there's no way they are still out there.</i>

09:31.143 --> 09:33.771
You're chasing ghosts, Max. God!

09:33.879 --> 09:37.610
You try sleeping once in a while,
you could see that for yourself.

09:37.716 --> 09:39.980
I thought I knew
all of Trevor's friends.

09:41.387 --> 09:44.049
Max, Natasha.
Natasha, Max.

09:44.156 --> 09:46.522
Jesus Christ!

09:46.625 --> 09:49.526
- Got a light?
- I don't smoke.

09:51.697 --> 09:54.359
- That's interesting.
- What?

09:54.466 --> 09:56.525
Your tattoo.
That's interesting.

09:57.670 --> 09:59.365
Oh, thank you.

10:08.614 --> 10:10.741
I don't know him. Okay?

10:11.784 --> 10:13.684
- Shit.
- What?

10:18.190 --> 10:21.023
<i>Stay back! What are you doing here?</i>

10:21.126 --> 10:22.923
- You can't keep following me around.
<i>- Come with me.</i>

10:23.028 --> 10:25.553
- Hey!
- Mind your own business.

10:25.664 --> 10:27.029
<i>You have no right to be here!</i>

10:27.132 --> 10:28.759
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

10:28.868 --> 10:32.201
<i> I'm clean.</i>
<i>I'm not doing anything wrong.</i>

10:32.304 --> 10:34.272
- Da?
- Da.

10:34.373 --> 10:37.342
Hey!
Why don't you relax?

10:38.444 --> 10:41.936
It's a party.
Have a drink.

10:42.047 --> 10:44.709
<i>Just stop it.</i>
<i>These are new friends.</i>

10:45.951 --> 10:47.782
<i>I don't see the others anymore!</i>

10:49.154 --> 10:50.178
<i>He's a cop.</i>

10:50.289 --> 10:53.190
<i>How much trouble can I get in?</i>

11:04.336 --> 11:08.204
My sister.
Sort of a bitch.

11:09.308 --> 11:11.208
- Hey, Max! Max.
- What are you doing?

11:11.310 --> 11:13.210
You have to go.
Okay? Now.

11:13.312 --> 11:15.542
I need to
ask her something first.

11:18.450 --> 11:19.417
Oh, Jesus Christ.

12:50.451 --> 12:53.011
There you are.

12:53.120 --> 12:55.611
Where'd you go?

12:55.723 --> 12:59.284
Take me somewhere. I'll tell you.

13:01.362 --> 13:03.353
See you around, Lupino.

13:56.450 --> 13:58.577
Hey.

13:58.686 --> 14:01.553
Easy.

14:04.825 --> 14:06.725
You just move in?

14:06.827 --> 14:09.387
So we're somewhere.

14:09.497 --> 14:12.091
What was goin' on
in that room back there?

14:16.027 --> 14:18.325
Hey!

14:20.465 --> 14:23.025
Who was the guy
with the tattoos on his face?

14:25.803 --> 14:28.601
Mmm.

14:36.848 --> 14:38.782
Fine.
What was her name?

14:39.884 --> 14:41.784
What are you talkin' about?
Who?

14:41.886 --> 14:45.686
The girl from the boring story
you want to tell me-

14:45.790 --> 14:48.281
the one that ends
with you living here.

14:48.393 --> 14:51.021
Very sad.

14:51.129 --> 14:55.793
<i>I'll tell you what.</i>
<i>Call me by her name.</i>

14:57.335 --> 15:00.896
Like this you can make love to her
just like she never left you.

15:02.940 --> 15:05.773
Oh, Max. I miss you.

15:09.213 --> 15:11.113
Get out.

15:12.650 --> 15:16.313
- Excuse me?
- I said, get out now.

15:20.725 --> 15:22.920
You're kicking <i>me</i>
out of your bed?

15:23.027 --> 15:25.689
Yeah.
Get your shit and get out.

15:54.992 --> 15:56.892
This is Owen. Leave a message.

15:56.994 --> 16:00.259
Owen, it's Natasha.

16:01.866 --> 16:04.266
Where's Lupino?
I need some more stuff.

16:04.368 --> 16:07.462
Yeah. Call me. Okay?

16:58.489 --> 16:59.979
No!

17:00.091 --> 17:02.753
No, not yet!
Not yet! Not yet!

17:59.150 --> 18:02.483
- What?
- Look. Jump in, will you?

18:14.932 --> 18:18.629
- Where are we going?
- I need you to look at something.

18:22.974 --> 18:25.306
- What about cameras?
Security cameras anywhere?

18:25.409 --> 18:27.673
There's got to be somebody
who saw something.

18:31.883 --> 18:33.783
Time of death is?

18:36.187 --> 18:38.451
We got body parts.

18:40.558 --> 18:43.356
<i>- They're already canvassing.</i>
- What happened to them?

18:43.461 --> 18:46.294
Her. Just one.

18:50.668 --> 18:53.865
I don't believe it.

18:53.971 --> 18:57.600
What, are you two back together?
Did you kiss and make up?

18:57.708 --> 19:00.268
Where are we on the weapon?

19:00.378 --> 19:03.108
We're nowhere yet.
I mean, looks like a blade...

19:03.214 --> 19:07.014
but, uh, too much blood
for that to be right.

19:07.118 --> 19:10.349
Hey, O'Brien! Just a sec. Hey, listen.

19:10.454 --> 19:14.117
- Why are you showing me this?
- We found this here.

19:17.361 --> 19:19.158
Did you know her, Max?

19:37.148 --> 19:39.048
It's Natasha.

19:41.485 --> 19:43.715
Let's take a ride.

19:43.821 --> 19:46.847
<i>Folks, we need you</i>
<i>to move back, please.</i>

20:10.881 --> 20:13.748
- What are we doing here?
- We're getting a beer, right?

20:15.653 --> 20:18.281
You'd rather do this
in the street?

20:18.389 --> 20:23.725
Fine. You were with the victim last night.
Your wallet was found in the alley.

20:23.828 --> 20:27.025
If you don't wanna talk to me, they're gonna
send somebody who doesn't know you...

20:27.131 --> 20:29.031
and won't care about
your side of the story.

20:29.133 --> 20:32.432
- I didn't kill her. I don't need a side.
- What's goin' on, Max?

20:32.536 --> 20:35.096
What are you mixed up in, man?
You can talk to me.

20:40.244 --> 20:42.940
You know what they think about you
at the force already, right?

20:43.047 --> 20:45.515
You should hear all the questions
I get about my old partner.

20:45.616 --> 20:49.746
- Well, good thing you got my back then, huh?
- What's that supposed to mean?

20:49.854 --> 20:51.754
It means that with your follow-through
on unsolved murders...

20:51.856 --> 20:53.756
I don't have much hope
for that girl in the alley.

20:53.858 --> 20:55.849
Is that what you think?

20:55.960 --> 20:58.952
That I didn't
work Michelle's case?

21:01.232 --> 21:03.223
I did everything.

21:03.334 --> 21:05.564
<i>- Everything!</i>
- He's still out there somewhere.

21:05.669 --> 21:08.263
One of them is still out there.
That's everything.

21:08.372 --> 21:10.499
<i>All right?</i>

21:10.608 --> 21:13.475
We're done here.

21:13.577 --> 21:15.977
<i>Come on! Max!</i>

21:17.648 --> 21:19.639
Very good.

21:19.750 --> 21:22.241
<i>Pleasure doing business with you.</i>

22:14.972 --> 22:17.167
- Detective Max Payne-
- Is not available.

22:17.274 --> 22:19.174
- Shit!
- Please leave a message.

22:19.276 --> 22:21.176
Max, it's me, Alex.

22:27.318 --> 22:29.411
Ms. Sax?

22:29.520 --> 22:31.420
I'm sorry for your loss.

22:34.992 --> 22:38.189
And we pulled
her cell phone log.

22:38.295 --> 22:42.595
Uh, last call was to an...
Owen Green.

22:44.668 --> 22:46.568
Called him twice.

23:08.926 --> 23:10.917
Max, it's me, Alex.

23:11.028 --> 23:12.996
<i>You're not gonna believe this,</i>
<i>but I think there's a connection...</i>

23:13.097 --> 23:15.156
<i>between that girl in the alley</i>
<i>and Michelle's murder.</i>

23:15.266 --> 23:17.393
<i>I'm heading over</i>
<i>to your apartment right now.</i>

23:41.619 --> 23:43.519
Alex, are you in here?

23:53.865 --> 23:55.765
Alex?

24:16.954 --> 24:18.854
Alex?

24:27.398 --> 24:28.490
Alex?

25:00.888 --> 25:04.415
<i> The E.R. doctor's old man</i>
<i>was a patrolman in the 45th.</i>

25:04.525 --> 25:06.425
<i>Got you on a quiet floor.</i>

25:06.527 --> 25:09.587
BB? Where am I?

25:09.697 --> 25:11.631
Saint Mary's.

25:11.732 --> 25:15.065
Came in lookin' pretty bad, Max.
What happened?

25:15.169 --> 25:17.660
I don't-

25:17.771 --> 25:20.672
Alex.

25:20.774 --> 25:23.607
When dispatch
couldn't raise him...

25:23.711 --> 25:27.306
they found out from Christa
where he'd gone.

25:27.414 --> 25:30.440
First unit got to you in time.

25:30.551 --> 25:32.451
But Alex was-

25:34.021 --> 25:35.955
Alex was dead.

25:39.226 --> 25:41.558
I got six shots off.
I hit something- someone-

25:41.662 --> 25:43.653
You gotta check the hospitals. You gotta check for-

25:43.764 --> 25:47.723
I'm not a cop anymore, Max.
I came to see about you.

25:49.703 --> 25:51.603
He wanted to
tell me something.

25:51.705 --> 25:55.471
Listen. Anything
you can remember will help.

25:55.576 --> 25:57.476
They got nothing for leads.

25:57.578 --> 26:00.479
The whole force has <i>you</i> pegged
as the prime suspect.

26:00.581 --> 26:02.481
Yeah, you tell them
where to find me.

26:03.651 --> 26:06.051
Wake starts in an hour.

26:06.153 --> 26:08.053
I'll pass that along.

26:12.860 --> 26:16.421
<i>- What do you think you're doing?</i>
- Paying my respects.

26:16.530 --> 26:19.328
Not like that, you aren't.

26:19.433 --> 26:23.426
I should have a clean shirt
for you at the office. It's on the way.

26:59.740 --> 27:02.436
<i>Mr. Hensley? There you go.</i>

27:06.013 --> 27:09.881
- When did they move in here?
- I guess we got the building last year.

27:09.984 --> 27:12.009
- "We"?
- Sorry.

27:12.119 --> 27:14.246
Gets to be a habit.

27:28.168 --> 27:31.501
- Mornin', Spike.
- Good morning, Mr. Hensley.

27:31.605 --> 27:35.041
You know the drill, sir.
Sign in your guest, please.

27:38.645 --> 27:41.375
Oh, my God.

27:42.950 --> 27:44.076
Max.

27:44.184 --> 27:46.311
Ms. Horne.

27:46.420 --> 27:49.048
How have you been?

27:49.156 --> 27:51.147
Fine, thanks.

27:51.258 --> 27:53.920
I hope you know
you can always call me.

27:54.028 --> 27:57.191
<i>Please, Max, if there is</i>
<i>ever anything we can do-</i>

27:57.297 --> 28:00.357
I know. I've been meaning to.
I got the cards. Thank you.

28:00.467 --> 28:03.493
She was such a bright light
in this company.

28:07.174 --> 28:09.438
I'm not makin' any guarantees
that any of this'll fit.

28:14.381 --> 28:17.214
I saved one of those for you.
Third page from the back.

28:18.452 --> 28:21.478
<i>They set up a scholarship</i>
<i>in her name.</i>

28:21.588 --> 28:24.921
<i>Kept comin' to me for suggestions</i>
<i>about what she might want.</i>

28:25.025 --> 28:28.188
<i>I said art.</i>

28:28.295 --> 28:30.855
She liked art, right?

28:30.964 --> 28:34.866
<i>They knew we were close.</i>
<i>Thought I was family.</i>

28:34.968 --> 28:37.300
It's a nice thing,
a scholarship.

28:37.404 --> 28:39.702
<i>Good way to remember somebody.</i>

28:39.807 --> 28:42.275
Hey, Joe.

28:42.376 --> 28:45.209
Max, you remember Joe,
right?

28:45.312 --> 28:48.042
Hey. You here pickin' up
some overtime?

28:48.148 --> 28:52.312
I'd think twice about that.
Hear the boss is a real asshole.

28:52.419 --> 28:56.287
Now that he's head of security,
we're supposed to laugh at his jokes.

28:56.390 --> 28:58.290
They still pay me like the janitor.

28:58.392 --> 29:00.758
She's lookin' for you.

29:00.861 --> 29:02.886
Just tried me
in my office too.

29:04.431 --> 29:06.331
Give me a second.

29:06.433 --> 29:07.900
Yeah?

29:08.001 --> 29:10.526
<i>Nicole?</i>

29:10.637 --> 29:13.572
<i>Relax.</i>
<i>I'm the head of security.</i>

29:35.496 --> 29:37.396
Christa.

29:41.768 --> 29:44.362
<i>Jesus.</i>

29:47.007 --> 29:50.272
All it would have taken
is one word from you...

29:51.378 --> 29:53.812
to give Alex some peace.

29:56.517 --> 29:58.576
Are you happy now, Max?

30:01.889 --> 30:04.050
You made him think
he hadn't done enough.

30:06.460 --> 30:08.360
What have you done, Max?

30:09.796 --> 30:11.991
What has Max Payne done?

30:14.268 --> 30:16.168
Except for bring misery...

30:17.538 --> 30:19.733
to everyone
who ever cared for him.

30:23.443 --> 30:26.640
Now please get out of my house.

30:26.747 --> 30:28.647
Please, just go.

30:44.331 --> 30:47.494
Ah, geez.
Watch out for this prick.

30:48.602 --> 30:50.502
Detective Max Payne?

30:50.604 --> 30:53.038
Jim Bravura, Internal Affairs.
I need you to come with me.

30:54.441 --> 30:57.035
- Now?
- Yeah, now.

30:59.279 --> 31:01.975
How'd the girl
have your wallet?

31:02.082 --> 31:04.107
She stole it.

31:04.218 --> 31:06.880
What do you mean, "stole"?
Like, picked your pocket?

31:10.357 --> 31:12.257
How was it
you knew each other?

31:12.359 --> 31:14.520
We met through a friend.

31:16.863 --> 31:19.058
Trevor Duncan.

31:19.166 --> 31:21.532
- He's your friend?
- I guess.

31:21.635 --> 31:24.001
That's classy.

31:24.104 --> 31:26.595
You know what Trevor does
for a livin', I assume.

31:27.708 --> 31:29.573
He used to snitch for me.

31:29.676 --> 31:31.667
Oh, used to.

31:33.880 --> 31:36.280
Tell me somethin', Max.

31:36.383 --> 31:39.477
What's a glorified file clerk
still need a snitch for, huh?

31:42.689 --> 31:45.249
So you'd piss
in a cup for us, right?

31:45.359 --> 31:49.295
You just said the magic words. Why don't
you call when you hear from a union lawyer?

31:49.396 --> 31:53.264
You and Detective Balder haven't
worked together since your reassignment.

31:54.768 --> 31:57.362
<i>What made you</i>
<i>get back in touch, huh?</i>

31:57.471 --> 32:00.304
- He wanted to talk.
<i>- And?</i>

32:02.276 --> 32:05.074
Hey, asshole!
I got two bodies in 10 body bags.

32:05.178 --> 32:07.078
<i>You were the last person</i>
<i>to see either one.</i>

32:07.180 --> 32:10.445
<i>Yeah, and some of that blood is mine.</i>
<i>Good luck with your case.</i>

32:10.550 --> 32:13.451
Nice work, Detective.

32:14.788 --> 32:19.782
Look, if you're really his friend,
then talk to him.

32:28.135 --> 32:30.797
Well, let's hope that felt good.

32:30.904 --> 32:33.532
Makes you look guilty.
You understand that, right?

32:33.640 --> 32:36.973
It's not just Alex's unit
that thinks you're the guy.

32:37.077 --> 32:40.069
You need friends
on the force right now.

32:40.180 --> 32:42.205
There's only so much I can do
from the outside.

32:45.285 --> 32:47.446
Where you goin'?

32:50.324 --> 32:52.224
Stupid son of a bitch.

32:53.760 --> 32:56.285
<i>Hey. I don't believe it.</i>

32:56.396 --> 33:00.162
- Just the guy.
<i>- You gotta be kiddin' me.</i>

33:00.267 --> 33:03.634
<i>- Let's get the son of a bitch.</i>
- Where you think you're goin'?

33:03.737 --> 33:07.264
<i>- Unbelievable.</i>
<i>- The detective in that office was killed.</i>

33:07.374 --> 33:11.003
<i>Get back here, asshole!</i>
<i>Where do you think you're goin'?</i>

33:11.111 --> 33:12.976
<i>There's no point runnin', Max!</i>
<i>What are you gonna do in there?</i>

33:22.081 --> 33:24.242
Back up. Back up.
Make a hole!

33:24.349 --> 33:26.783
Back up, goddamn it!
Make a hole!

33:27.986 --> 33:30.716
<i>- He's a cop killer.</i>
- Open up, Max!

33:30.823 --> 33:33.792
<i>Open up the goddamn door, Max!</i>

33:36.428 --> 33:39.693
Open up! Don't make it hard!
Open up!

33:43.168 --> 33:46.069
Goddamn it! Open up this fuckin' door!

33:46.171 --> 33:48.765
<i>- Open it!</i>
<i>- Let's bust his face!</i>

33:48.874 --> 33:52.674
<i>- Open the goddamn door!</i>
<i>- You're only gonna make it worse!</i>

33:54.346 --> 33:57.110
<i>Come on, Max!</i>
<i>Get your ass out here!</i>

33:57.216 --> 33:58.615
<i>- Bust it down!</i>
- Open up!

34:05.958 --> 34:08.290
<i>Now, Max! Now!</i>
<i>Open the door!</i>

34:11.663 --> 34:13.391
Get ya, Max!

34:13.498 --> 34:15.399
Son of a bitch!

34:24.842 --> 34:27.208
Hey, Mike.
Where is he?

34:31.373 --> 34:35.367
Oh, for God's sake, Max. You're gonna freeze
to death. Why don't you come inside?

34:35.478 --> 34:38.538
Alex knew something about Michelle.
Something new.

34:38.648 --> 34:40.547
Don't you think he would've
told you if he had something?

34:40.650 --> 34:42.641
He was trying to
the night he was killed.

34:42.752 --> 34:45.915
- Whatever was in the room-
- What do you think you're looking for?

34:46.022 --> 34:48.217
- Forget it. All right?
- Max, talk to me!

34:48.324 --> 34:50.315
Max?

34:50.427 --> 34:52.725
Now where you goin'?

35:02.976 --> 35:05.467
<i>... Max Payne.</i>

35:39.012 --> 35:42.971
Drop your weapon.

35:43.083 --> 35:45.108
Just take it easy.

35:47.053 --> 35:50.716
- Remove your backup piece with your left hand.

35:59.165 --> 36:01.326
- That's it.
- Kneel down.

36:01.434 --> 36:03.425
- What?
- Kneel the fuck down!

36:05.338 --> 36:07.238
Shit.

36:14.314 --> 36:16.714
We need to talk about my sister.

36:20.220 --> 36:23.849
Look, my partner was killed too.
We're both looking for the same person.

36:23.957 --> 36:26.187
Yeah, you.

36:30.954 --> 36:33.548
Who's Owen Green?

36:35.292 --> 36:38.090
- How did you get that name?
- Look, Natasha called-

36:38.195 --> 36:41.392
- Don't say her name!
- I heard her call him. Okay?

36:41.498 --> 36:44.228
Owen's probably the last person
who saw her alive.

36:44.334 --> 36:48.896
Yeah? Except for the guy that
left his wallet laying by her body.

36:49.005 --> 36:51.530
Does that sound like something
a homicide cop gets wrong?

36:51.641 --> 36:56.010
Whoever killed your sister probably did
the same thing to my partner and maybe my-

36:57.481 --> 37:01.383
Look, you wanna help?
Help me find Owen Green.

37:18.869 --> 37:20.769
<i>Right here.</i>

37:20.871 --> 37:22.930
Green is on the top floor.

37:25.942 --> 37:29.173
You know what I do for a living.
You try anything, and I'll kill you.

38:08.860 --> 38:10.760
Who is this guy?

38:10.862 --> 38:13.296
Some junkie
my sister used to know.

38:45.863 --> 38:49.492
- Owen! Owen, open up!

38:50.868 --> 38:53.029
Owen?

38:57.241 --> 38:59.266
Owen?

39:03.714 --> 39:05.614
Hey!

39:07.285 --> 39:09.276
They're comin'.

39:10.388 --> 39:12.288
<i>Owen!</i>

39:12.390 --> 39:14.290
<i>Hey, Owen.</i>

39:16.761 --> 39:19.229
They're coming.

39:19.330 --> 39:21.958
Owen, look at me.

39:22.066 --> 39:24.694
<i>Owen, look at me.</i>

39:24.802 --> 39:28.670
I know Natasha called you.
Do you know what happened to her?

39:30.308 --> 39:32.469
She's gone.

39:35.379 --> 39:38.075
They took her.

39:38.182 --> 39:40.116
<i>Owen?</i>

39:41.619 --> 39:44.747
Owen, just relax.

39:44.855 --> 39:47.255
They took her up in their wings.

39:49.360 --> 39:51.351
They took her.

39:53.164 --> 39:55.928
<i>- Owen-</i>

40:00.204 --> 40:01.501
<i>Owen.</i>

40:30.224 --> 40:32.283
Jesus.

40:52.313 --> 40:56.716
<i>You know, it isn't anything new. People jump</i>
<i>out of windows. They go crazy for no reason.</i>

40:56.817 --> 40:58.978
It just happens.

41:02.990 --> 41:05.390
My Natasha
got all her work done here.

41:16.203 --> 41:18.603
I have to
call you back, okay?

41:21.008 --> 41:23.067
Can I help you
with somethin'?

41:23.177 --> 41:25.145
Yeah.

41:26.180 --> 41:28.273
If I wanted to
get this tattoo-

41:28.382 --> 41:30.373
- You in the marine corps?
- This one.

41:30.484 --> 41:33.009
<i>What's it mean?</i>

41:33.120 --> 41:35.554
That's a Norse Valkyrie.

41:35.656 --> 41:38.352
Vikings used to wear them
for protection.

41:38.459 --> 41:43.328
Valkyries fly over the battlefield
picking out the righteous dead.

41:43.430 --> 41:47.457
They reward the people
who draw first blood.

41:47.568 --> 41:49.468
A soldier's angel.

41:52.072 --> 41:55.132
In Norse mythology...

41:55.242 --> 41:57.904
the only way
you get to go to heaven...

41:58.011 --> 42:01.003
is to die in violence.

42:01.115 --> 42:04.107
You die in your sleep,
you go to hell.

42:06.454 --> 42:09.753
- Protection from what?
- Huh?

42:09.858 --> 42:12.884
What do you mean, "huh"?
You said people get the tattoo as protection.

42:12.994 --> 42:15.758
What are they afraid of?

42:18.466 --> 42:23.130
<i>Please!</i>

42:28.343 --> 42:30.743
Please-

43:07.916 --> 43:11.716
- Come on!
- ¡Callate!

43:11.820 --> 43:15.381
<i>¡Callate!</i>

43:36.645 --> 43:38.806
Oh, God!

44:24.960 --> 44:26.860
This is far enough.

44:41.609 --> 44:44.134
I need to speak with Lincoln.

45:06.101 --> 45:10.902
- You expecting company there, Lincoln?
- It's very dangerous right now.

45:11.006 --> 45:12.906
I hear about your sister.

45:14.275 --> 45:17.574
Yeah?
You know anything about it?

45:18.680 --> 45:21.148
She will not be the last.

45:24.686 --> 45:26.677
What about the tattoos?

45:26.788 --> 45:29.086
Huh? What do they mean?

45:29.190 --> 45:31.090
The wings.

45:32.527 --> 45:34.427
He marks them.

45:35.930 --> 45:37.830
Yeah? What does that mean?

45:37.932 --> 45:40.799
The devil
is building his army.

45:41.903 --> 45:43.461
Yeah.

45:45.840 --> 45:48.400
Does this devil have a name?

45:48.510 --> 45:50.842
Many.

45:50.945 --> 45:53.641
The one you are looking for
is Lupino.

45:56.618 --> 45:59.587
A place called Rag Na Rock.

45:59.687 --> 46:02.247
<i>It's an old club. East Side.</i>

46:06.094 --> 46:10.121
Listen. Um, you still got
an in with the cops, right?

46:12.434 --> 46:14.402
See if they know anything
about a Detective Max Payne.

46:14.502 --> 46:17.027
Max Payne?

46:19.074 --> 46:21.042
What?

46:21.142 --> 46:23.940
<i>Max Payne-</i>
<i>he's been hunting.</i>

46:25.213 --> 46:28.444
Three years
of kicking down doors.

46:30.752 --> 46:33.414
He is looking
for something...

46:33.521 --> 46:36.649
that God wants
to stay hidden.

46:36.758 --> 46:40.751
And that's what makes him
even more dangerous.

46:45.266 --> 46:49.600
Mona,
stay away from Max Payne.

46:52.740 --> 46:55.436
You don't want to be near him
when Judgment Day comes.

47:07.255 --> 47:09.951
<i>They took her up in their wings.</i>

47:10.058 --> 47:12.754
<i> Their wings are golden.</i>
<i>The feathers only look black.</i>

47:14.796 --> 47:16.764
<i>That's a Norse Valkyrie.</i>

47:16.865 --> 47:19.698
<i>A soldier's angel.</i>

47:19.801 --> 47:21.996
<i> She was</i>
<i>such a bright light in this company.</i>

49:34.302 --> 49:36.964
- What is it? What's going on?
- Coffee?

49:37.071 --> 49:39.062
It isn't that
I've been missing something.

49:40.508 --> 49:42.408
It's that something <i>is</i> missing.

49:42.510 --> 49:46.139
- So?
<i>- BB, what do you mean, "so''?</i>

49:46.247 --> 49:48.545
What would somebody want
with her work papers?

49:48.650 --> 49:50.208
I don't know.

49:50.318 --> 49:52.786
Who would then? Her old supervisor-
What is his name?

49:52.887 --> 49:54.337
Max, this has gone far enough!

49:54.338 --> 49:55.788
<i>- That snotty-nosed, little preppy prick-
What is his name?</i>

49:55.890 --> 49:58.552
Colvin. John Colvin.
Is he still around?

49:58.660 --> 50:00.924
Hold on, Max.

50:01.029 --> 50:03.054
BB, is he still working
for the company?

50:06.768 --> 50:08.668
Jason Colvin.

50:09.704 --> 50:11.604
Guy's name is Jason.

50:11.706 --> 50:13.867
Thank you.

50:27.021 --> 50:28.921
<i>This is Detective Bravura.</i>

50:29.023 --> 50:32.424
<i> Detective, I need to speak</i>
<i>with you about Max right away.</i>

50:32.527 --> 50:34.654
<i>Please. It's urgent.</i>

50:36.798 --> 50:39.596
<i>Detective, thanks for seeing me at my office.</i>

50:39.701 --> 50:41.999
<i>I need to explain</i>
<i>what happened to Max.</i>

50:42.103 --> 50:44.867
A file
can't tell you everything.

50:44.972 --> 50:48.408
Maybe you think that's all
you need to know about Max.

50:53.114 --> 50:56.083
<i>Can't tell you</i>
<i>how beautiful Michelle was...</i>

50:57.719 --> 50:59.778
how happy they were together-

51:05.326 --> 51:08.261
<i>Can't tell you how the baby</i>
<i>looked just like him.</i>

51:19.774 --> 51:21.674
<i>It started out as a robbery.</i>

51:24.846 --> 51:29.806
<i>The perps were losers, garbage.</i>
<i>Had records, but nothing big.</i>

51:32.387 --> 51:35.151
<i>That day, though, who knows?</i>

51:37.258 --> 51:40.159
<i>Guess they were out</i>
<i>for something... more.</i>

52:22.537 --> 52:25.199
Michelle!

52:25.306 --> 52:28.764
Michelle! Michelle!

52:28.876 --> 52:32.334
Michelle!

52:37.452 --> 52:40.717
It's okay. The angels burn
within them now.

53:38.779 --> 53:42.545
<i>He was maybe 10 minutes too late.</i>

53:48.289 --> 53:51.725
<i>That's all.</i>
<i>Ten minutes.</i>

54:04.906 --> 54:07.466
We looked everywhere for the third guy.
But there was nothin' to go on.

54:09.302 --> 54:10.462
<i>Max...</i>

54:10.570 --> 54:15.064
<i>transferred to Cold Case,</i>
<i>working leads that went nowhere.</i>

54:15.175 --> 54:20.078
<i>He was... never the same.</i>

54:21.514 --> 54:24.381
Of course not.

54:24.484 --> 54:29.478
Understand.
This is my old partner's kid.

54:31.424 --> 54:34.552
He's family.
You gotta help him here.

54:35.862 --> 54:38.296
You should hear the kind of things
Max is saying.

54:38.398 --> 54:40.662
<i>None of it</i>
<i>makes any sense.</i>

54:40.767 --> 54:44.760
He's gotten in his head that someone here
at the company is responsible.

54:44.871 --> 54:50.639
I'm worried he's gonna... get into another
situation before I can convince him to come in.

54:52.545 --> 54:55.105
- So you really think he's-
- I think you need to find him.

55:28.581 --> 55:30.515
What is it, Jason?

55:31.651 --> 55:33.551
I, uh-

55:48.835 --> 55:51.463
Is this a threat?

55:52.672 --> 55:55.903
No! No, l-

55:56.943 --> 55:58.911
I just thought
you should be aware.

56:00.380 --> 56:03.281
Just take care of it, Jason.

56:27.607 --> 56:29.802
You'll have the opportunity
to come in and talk to-

56:34.914 --> 56:36.814
There's someone in your office.

56:41.454 --> 56:43.479
It's a detective.

56:59.022 --> 57:01.047
This your daughter?

57:02.793 --> 57:06.024
Yes, it is.
Three years old.

57:06.129 --> 57:08.063
She's beautiful.

57:08.165 --> 57:10.497
Is there something I can
help you with, Detective?

57:10.601 --> 57:12.796
I don't know yet.

57:15.272 --> 57:18.173
Maybe if you told me
what this was about.

57:19.509 --> 57:22.774
It's a homicide-
multiple homicides.

57:25.249 --> 57:27.149
I didn't get your name.

57:29.186 --> 57:31.711
Max Payne.

57:32.990 --> 57:35.857
Sorry.
I didn't recognize you.

57:35.959 --> 57:38.689
That's okay.

57:38.795 --> 57:41.161
What can you tell me about
what Michelle was working on...

57:43.267 --> 57:45.167
right before she died?

57:52.843 --> 57:54.936
I don't know, routine projects.
Um-

57:57.114 --> 57:59.014
Nothin' really
out of the ordinary.

58:05.689 --> 58:08.886
Look, it's really hard
to be specific that... long ago.

58:08.992 --> 58:11.961
- Um-
- Well, can't you look it up?

58:13.864 --> 58:16.162
I don't know how I would,
really.

58:19.069 --> 58:22.698
You know th-that far back,
uh, any documents we had-

58:22.806 --> 58:26.401
would be gone, and-

58:29.379 --> 58:31.347
I'm not-
I'm not sure of any other way.

58:31.448 --> 58:33.416
So there's just no trace of her?

58:33.517 --> 58:36.281
Well, it's nothing personal.
We just, uh-

58:37.721 --> 58:40.690
Can't keep-
Save everything and, uh-

58:40.791 --> 58:44.192
- You need to make a call?
- Maybe I should.

58:44.294 --> 58:48.754
Yeah. Beautiful office
you have here.

58:48.865 --> 58:53.234
Jackie, hi. Uh, Detective-

58:54.971 --> 58:56.768
- What do you know?
- Wait.

58:58.975 --> 59:00.755
I need to talk to somebody about
a woman that used to work here.

59:00.756 --> 59:02.536
You can have a seat over there.

59:07.273 --> 59:09.605
Uh, Mr. Colvin?

59:09.709 --> 59:11.802
- You're lying to me! Why?
- I'm not!

59:11.911 --> 59:14.880
<i>- Mr. Colvin?</i>

59:14.981 --> 59:17.609
- Tell me what happened to Michelle.
- I don't know.

59:17.717 --> 59:19.412
Mr. Colvin, are you okay?

59:19.519 --> 59:23.114
- Jackie!
<i>- Mr. Colvin, it's Jackie! I can hear you!</i>

59:23.222 --> 59:25.281
<i>Are you all right?</i>

59:28.561 --> 59:32.122
- What was she working on?
- I don't know!

59:32.231 --> 59:35.098
I was in charge of a different project.
It was a government contract.

59:35.201 --> 59:36.828
What did it have to do
with Michelle?

59:36.936 --> 59:39.302
Nothing! She was just-

59:40.940 --> 59:42.840
Security.

59:42.942 --> 59:44.842
Can I speak to BB, please?

59:46.979 --> 59:49.072
- Yeah?
- BB, help! It's Jackie. Jason's in trouble.

59:49.182 --> 59:51.082
- What?
- Should I call your guys?

59:51.184 --> 59:54.381
- No, no, no. I'll call.
- Hurry, please.

59:57.390 --> 59:59.858
Oh, shit. Okay.

59:59.959 --> 01:00:02.519
It was a military operation.

01:00:02.628 --> 01:00:07.292
<i>It was something to make...</i>
<i>soldiers more aggressive in combat.</i>

01:00:07.400 --> 01:00:13.270
It was a disaster. It only worked
on one percent. Made them invincible.

01:00:13.373 --> 01:00:17.969
All right? The rest suffered horrible
hallucinations- devils, demons.

01:00:20.146 --> 01:00:22.341
<i>It drove them insane.</i>

01:00:22.448 --> 01:00:26.578
I mean,
the effects were uncontrollable.

01:00:26.686 --> 01:00:31.282
And the stuff was so addictive, we couldn't
even guarantee the safety of our own scientists.

01:00:31.391 --> 01:00:36.556
<i>And we had to shut it down.</i>
<i>The test subjects, they'd follow 'em home.</i>

01:00:36.662 --> 01:00:39.028
They'd kill 'em,
just for an extra dose.

01:00:40.166 --> 01:00:43.932
- Is that what happened to Michelle?
- No.

01:00:46.539 --> 01:00:48.439
<i>Let's go! Move! Move!</i>

01:00:55.915 --> 01:00:58.406
- What do you mean, no? What happened to her then?
- Please! Jesus!

01:00:58.518 --> 01:01:02.750
Please! Look. She didn't even know
what was coming for her.

01:01:02.855 --> 01:01:06.313
<i> Mr. Colvin, I called security,</i>
<i>and they're on their way!</i>

01:01:06.426 --> 01:01:10.920
I will tell you what happened. You gotta
get me outta here though. Right now.

01:01:11.030 --> 01:01:12.497
What are you talking about?

01:01:12.498 --> 01:01:13.965
I will confess to everything,
but you gotta get me outta here!

01:01:14.066 --> 01:01:16.933
That's not good enough! You tell me
what happened to her right now!

01:01:17.036 --> 01:01:21.268
She was killed because of the drugs!
The envelope.

01:01:21.374 --> 01:01:24.366
<i>Bring it with us.</i>
<i>Everything. It's all in there.</i>

01:01:24.477 --> 01:01:28.140
Please. You've gotta
protect me from them.

01:01:28.247 --> 01:01:30.078
Who are you talking about?

01:01:30.183 --> 01:01:32.617
The man who killed your wife!

01:01:32.718 --> 01:01:35.619
Get the envelope.
Get it!

01:01:37.190 --> 01:01:39.249
Let's go.

01:01:42.695 --> 01:01:44.663
Calm down!

01:01:44.764 --> 01:01:47.164
Relax! N.Y.P. D!

01:02:20.566 --> 01:02:22.295
<i>- Shots fired!</i>

01:02:28.441 --> 01:02:30.773
- Central Dispatch.
- This is Jim Bravura. I.A.

01:02:30.877 --> 01:02:32.936
What unit is responding
to the Aesir call?

01:02:38.384 --> 01:02:40.215
The Aesir building! You mean
nobody's called anything in yet?

01:02:40.319 --> 01:02:43.186
- Would you like to report an incident?
- Hell, yes, I'd like to report somethin'!

01:02:43.289 --> 01:02:44.779
We have machine gun fire
in Midtown!

01:02:52.398 --> 01:02:53.422
Fire!

01:02:57.537 --> 01:02:59.004
<i>God damn it!</i>

01:03:03.910 --> 01:03:06.174
<i>- Get down!</i>
<i>- </i>

01:03:14.120 --> 01:03:16.054
Move! Move! Move! Move!

01:03:21.727 --> 01:03:23.991
<i>Hold fire! Hold fire!</i>

01:03:43.916 --> 01:03:47.113
- Knock down that door!
- Put your hands up!

01:03:47.219 --> 01:03:49.551
- You need to come in now!
- Not a chance!

01:03:49.655 --> 01:03:51.646
- Come on!
- Is this about your wife?

01:03:51.757 --> 01:03:54.317
- Colvin knew.
- Take it easy, Max.

01:03:54.427 --> 01:03:56.691
Just come in and we'll talk about this
right now. All right?

01:03:56.796 --> 01:03:59.856
Clear!

01:04:02.134 --> 01:04:04.034
Move!

01:04:04.136 --> 01:04:06.104
- Where is he?
- I can't see!

01:04:06.205 --> 01:04:08.105
Got anything?

01:04:08.207 --> 01:04:10.402
No, he's gone!

01:04:10.509 --> 01:04:13.239
Great job, boys! See what you did?
You let 'im get away.

01:04:13.346 --> 01:04:15.541
<i>- Let me see your hands!</i>
- Relax, motherfucker! N.Y.P.D.

01:04:15.648 --> 01:04:18.242
<i>- What the fuck is goin' on up there?</i>
- Yeah. Good job!

01:04:18.351 --> 01:04:21.184
Everybody gonna get a medal for this.
Great! Damn!

01:04:28.894 --> 01:04:30.521
I'm at the office.
I'll call you back.

01:04:59.215 --> 01:05:04.312
<i>... and will forever give them</i>
<i>the combat edge in conflicts of the future.</i>

01:05:04.421 --> 01:05:10.018
<i>Valkyr- 100% effective.</i>
<i>100% combat tested.</i>

01:05:10.126 --> 01:05:13.357
<i>The new weapon</i>
<i>in the war on terror.</i>

01:05:13.463 --> 01:05:16.523
<i>Valkyr, the strength of freedom.</i>

01:05:16.633 --> 01:05:21.229
<i>- Valkyr, winning the war on terror.</i>
- You need to see this.

01:05:23.907 --> 01:05:26.307
<i>From the dawn of time...</i>

01:05:26.409 --> 01:05:30.277
great generals have always known
the one fundamental truth of warfare.

01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:33.178
<i>Morale wins battles.</i>

01:05:33.283 --> 01:05:37.014
Thanks to the breakthroughs made
by Aesir Pharmaceuticals...

01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:43.059
the military of tomorrow will be able to
unlock the limitless potential inside every soldier.

01:05:43.159 --> 01:05:48.961
<i>Introducing Valkyr.</i>
<i>The strength of freedom.</i>

01:05:50.133 --> 01:05:53.227
<i>That's what this is about? A drug?</i>

01:06:01.044 --> 01:06:06.482
How has your experience of combat
improved since taking the drug Valkyr?

01:06:06.583 --> 01:06:09.916
Well, I'm never scared, for starters.

01:06:10.019 --> 01:06:14.456
<i> Describe to me, if you will,</i>
<i>how is Valkyr winning the war on terror?</i>

01:06:14.557 --> 01:06:17.287
You face down
a group of insurgents...

01:06:17.393 --> 01:06:22.456
and instead of fear,
you're filled with, um, peace, I guess.

01:06:22.565 --> 01:06:26.001
<i>It's like something's</i>
<i>watching over you from above.</i>

01:06:26.102 --> 01:06:27.797
You feel like you have wings.

01:06:27.904 --> 01:06:31.772
<i>So wouldn't you say you feel stronger,</i>
<i>more secure, more capable?</i>

01:06:31.875 --> 01:06:36.369
Oh, definitely. It's just whatever it takes
to win the war out there.

01:06:36.479 --> 01:06:39.642
I feel indestructible.
Nothing can stop me.

01:06:39.749 --> 01:06:41.979
I can face anything.

01:06:42.085 --> 01:06:45.145
<i>Have you noticed any side effects?</i>

01:06:47.857 --> 01:06:50.553
I can only speak for myself,
and, um, no.

01:06:50.660 --> 01:06:55.324
- I apologize. You wanna do it again?
- No, we're good.

01:06:55.431 --> 01:06:59.162
<i>- That's enough. Turn it off.</i>

01:07:01.204 --> 01:07:04.571
Killed my wife.

01:07:04.674 --> 01:07:06.835
<i>Natasha too.</i>

01:07:08.778 --> 01:07:11.178
He's in an old club
called Rag Na Rock.

01:07:14.851 --> 01:07:19.151
- You know where it is?
- Yeah.

01:07:26.496 --> 01:07:29.863
<i>Forget it, Max.</i>
<i>You go there, you die.</i>

01:07:33.369 --> 01:07:35.929
You have my help with anything else,
but not to go in there.

01:07:36.039 --> 01:07:37.939
Yeah, you keep it then.

01:07:42.045 --> 01:07:44.240
You don't wanna
make it out alive.

01:07:47.150 --> 01:07:50.381
You think that if he puts you out
of your misery, you'll be with them again.

01:07:51.955 --> 01:07:54.685
Yeah, I hope
that's how it works.

01:09:25.381 --> 01:09:27.679
<i>Copy that. You need help up front?</i>

01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:34.720
<i>Unit Six, Lupino is secure.</i>

01:10:01.289 --> 01:10:03.223
Ow!

01:14:04.231 --> 01:14:07.291
You hear them coming.

01:14:10.504 --> 01:14:14.065
We'll see which one of us
they're flying for.

01:14:14.175 --> 01:14:16.905
We'll see which one of us
they love best.

01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:21.648
God, you're so blessed.

01:14:23.384 --> 01:14:28.651
The angels-The angels are not
done with you yet!

01:14:52.238 --> 01:14:54.138
BB?

01:14:59.779 --> 01:15:01.804
What's goin' on here, BB?

01:15:02.916 --> 01:15:05.908
Let's go.

01:15:06.019 --> 01:15:09.147
Let's get outta here.

01:15:16.329 --> 01:15:18.854
BB- BB, what's goin' on here?

01:15:18.965 --> 01:15:22.833
BB, I looked at Lupino, he didn't know
who I was. What are you doin' here?

01:15:27.474 --> 01:15:29.942
- Now?
- No, not yet!

01:15:30.043 --> 01:15:32.011
Cuff him.

01:15:37.384 --> 01:15:41.821
<i> What was I supposed to do?</i>
<i>Michelle kept nosin' around.</i>

01:15:41.921 --> 01:15:45.186
<i>Some boxes from a dead project</i>
<i>went missing.</i>

01:15:45.291 --> 01:15:47.953
She mentioned it to me without knowing
what it really meant.

01:15:48.061 --> 01:15:51.690
I had to-
I had to talk to her.

01:15:51.798 --> 01:15:55.529
Show her my side
before she took it to someone else.

01:15:55.635 --> 01:15:57.796
<i>Before that night...</i>

01:15:57.904 --> 01:16:01.396
<i>the things that went wrong for me</i>
<i>seemed impossible to do anything about.</i>

01:16:03.143 --> 01:16:07.876
Michelle was the first problem in my life
small enough to reach out and stop.

01:16:10.079 --> 01:16:14.140
Once that happened, though, once I realized
I could use the strength of my hands...

01:16:14.250 --> 01:16:17.242
to keep one thing
from being taken away from me-

01:16:18.654 --> 01:16:23.557
Well, by the time Michelle
stopped screaming that night...

01:16:23.659 --> 01:16:25.854
I'd learned
the most amazing lesson.

01:16:27.730 --> 01:16:31.222
I could've been doing this
my entire life.

01:16:33.669 --> 01:16:37.366
I was a new person
that night.

01:16:39.108 --> 01:16:42.635
All the other things
that I'd ever let go.

01:16:42.745 --> 01:16:47.910
The-The times I'd accepted
my own... weakness...

01:16:48.017 --> 01:16:50.508
I could've just reached out
my hands and stopped it.

01:16:50.620 --> 01:16:55.250
<i>And from there, figuring out</i>
<i>how to put the drug on the street...</i>

01:16:55.358 --> 01:17:00.057
how to make use of Lupino and
the rest of them, well, that was easy.

01:17:00.163 --> 01:17:02.529
But only because of Michelle-

01:17:02.632 --> 01:17:05.999
the first problem
I really solved for myself.

01:17:08.504 --> 01:17:12.600
The second... was the baby.

01:17:32.495 --> 01:17:35.396
Okay, enough.
Enough of this shit.

01:17:35.498 --> 01:17:37.398
BB!

01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:40.992
Joe, why don't you
calm the fuck down?

01:17:52.181 --> 01:17:55.673
It's not like we didn't see it comin'.

01:17:55.785 --> 01:17:58.083
Sullen, withdrawn.

01:17:58.187 --> 01:18:01.088
<i>Max just never seemed</i>
<i>the same after the tragedy.</i>

01:18:03.092 --> 01:18:04.787
Grab me some of that rope.

01:18:05.027 --> 01:18:09.020
It's a good thing his father
didn't live to see it though.

01:18:09.131 --> 01:18:14.068
The great Bill Payne's only son.

01:18:15.771 --> 01:18:20.504
A strung-out
junkie suicide.

01:18:22.178 --> 01:18:23.736
It would have eaten him alive-

01:18:29.619 --> 01:18:30.916
<i>Get him, Joe!</i>

01:18:55.702 --> 01:18:59.331
Screw him.
He'll freeze to death.

01:19:02.042 --> 01:19:03.942
Come on.

01:20:35.669 --> 01:20:37.637
Not yet, Max.

01:23:10.590 --> 01:23:13.525
<i>Bravura! What the hell is goin' on?</i>

01:23:13.627 --> 01:23:18.155
Why is half my force here instead of out
on the street? Under what authority do you-

01:23:18.265 --> 01:23:21.792
I am investigating the shooting
of an unarmed civilian, Jason Colvin.

01:23:21.902 --> 01:23:24.700
And the attempted murder
of Detective Max Payne.

01:23:24.804 --> 01:23:26.704
Really? Well, I heard
he took the first shot.

01:23:26.806 --> 01:23:30.537
If I know the men I serve with, I don't think
that they're gonna contradict that.

01:23:30.644 --> 01:23:33.010
- Yeah, and what kinda men would that be?
- These are real cops.

01:23:33.113 --> 01:23:34.808
- Oh.
- No offense.

01:23:34.915 --> 01:23:40.080
None taken. Agent Taliente,
I'd like you to meet a real cop.

01:23:40.186 --> 01:23:44.486
Detective. Jack Taliente,
Special Agent, F.B.I. Who are you?

01:23:50.664 --> 01:23:53.827
Bravura called in the F.B.I.

01:23:53.934 --> 01:23:55.868
They're on their way.

01:23:59.172 --> 01:24:03.302
For God sakes, come on!
Max is dead! They got nothin' else!

01:24:03.410 --> 01:24:05.674
<i>Come on!</i>

01:24:07.047 --> 01:24:09.777
- Get 'em in! Get 'em in!
- Car's waiting! Let's go!

01:24:12.319 --> 01:24:13.718
<i>Hit the button! P1!</i>

01:24:13.820 --> 01:24:16.721
Calm down, Joe.

01:24:16.823 --> 01:24:20.054
This is Air One
proceeding northbound 3-5-0-500.

01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:23.220
E.T.A. three mikes.
Give me a frequency to push to.

01:24:23.330 --> 01:24:26.891
<i> P.D. Air One,</i>
<i>please return my frequency. 126-105.</i>

01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:29.195
Copy that, Dispatch.
We're inbound.

01:24:31.338 --> 01:24:33.363
Your car's waiting, sir.

01:24:48.855 --> 01:24:50.823
Oh, shit.

01:24:53.054 --> 01:24:55.648
- He's not dead. He's here.
- Bullshit.

01:24:58.960 --> 01:25:01.224
- Let's move it! Move! Move!
- Go!

01:25:03.398 --> 01:25:05.491
Get him, Joe!

01:25:05.600 --> 01:25:07.534
Where the hell is he?

01:25:11.306 --> 01:25:13.206
Where the hell you going, Joe?

01:25:16.778 --> 01:25:19.679
<i>- P.D. Air One, say your last.</i>
- We need more information.

01:25:19.781 --> 01:25:23.512
Do you got Bravura on the line for us? We need-
We need more information on this situation.

01:25:23.618 --> 01:25:25.381
Who you callin'?

01:25:28.957 --> 01:25:31.653
It's late.

01:25:31.760 --> 01:25:36.322
- I need you to send a helicopter to the roof.
- What are you talking about, BB?

01:25:36.431 --> 01:25:39.525
The Michelle Payne thing's
coming back on us!

01:25:51.813 --> 01:25:53.804
<i>Air One,</i>
<i>this is Lieutenant Jim Bravura.</i>

01:25:53.915 --> 01:25:56.577
<i>Federal agents and uniforms</i>
<i>are inbound at this time.</i>

01:26:09.697 --> 01:26:12.427
Take some C-4.

01:26:12.534 --> 01:26:16.630
- Wire it so he can't make it to the roof.
- Are you nuts?

01:26:16.738 --> 01:26:19.263
You saw him.

01:26:19.374 --> 01:26:22.366
<i>You saw him, Joe.</i>
<i>He isn't gonna stop.</i>

01:26:30.118 --> 01:26:31.915
No!

01:26:50.238 --> 01:26:51.705
Okay, we got multiple shots
fired. We need back-up ASAP.

01:26:51.806 --> 01:26:52.773
<i>Copy that, P.D. Air One.</i>

01:27:13.620 --> 01:27:16.180
<i>- Michelle?</i>
- Max.

01:27:18.725 --> 01:27:20.886
Max?

01:28:32.055 --> 01:28:36.549
Max! Max, come on.

01:28:36.659 --> 01:28:40.857
Listen, I will hold them off for as long
as I can, but you have to finish this.

01:28:40.964 --> 01:28:44.991
Max, come on.

01:28:45.101 --> 01:28:48.195
Come on.
Come on. Take it.

01:28:48.304 --> 01:28:49.896
Take it!

01:28:52.776 --> 01:28:54.676
Max, come on.
Look at me.

01:28:57.180 --> 01:28:59.307
You're not done yet.

01:29:09.759 --> 01:29:14.025
Come on. Come on, pick up!
Where are you? Come on!

01:29:47.630 --> 01:29:51.498
<i>Be careful with that thing.</i>

01:29:51.601 --> 01:29:54.468
Come on now, Mona.

01:29:55.638 --> 01:29:58.072
I'm sure we can
work something out.

01:30:06.049 --> 01:30:08.643
BB!

01:30:34.878 --> 01:30:40.248
<i> Detective Max Payne is in the line</i>
<i>of fire. Snipers, do not take the shot.</i>

01:30:43.286 --> 01:30:46.847
- Bravura!
- You take Payne alive if there's anything left.

01:31:05.742 --> 01:31:08.370
Calm down, BB.

01:31:14.475 --> 01:31:17.967
Holy shit!
Breaker, this is Air One.

01:31:32.559 --> 01:31:34.993
Run!

01:31:35.095 --> 01:31:36.995
Go! Go!

01:31:52.246 --> 01:31:54.441
<i>LaGuardia Tower, this is P.D. Air One.</i>

01:31:54.548 --> 01:31:56.778
<i>We have a major explosion</i>
<i>at the Aesir building.</i>

01:31:56.884 --> 01:31:58.943
<i>Bravura! You all right?</i>

01:31:59.053 --> 01:32:01.715
- Get everybody upstairs! Now!
- Guys, that's our cue.

01:32:01.822 --> 01:32:05.223
Division One, upstairs! Right now!
On the double! Let's go!

01:32:09.463 --> 01:32:14.162
Where are you?

01:32:45.897 --> 01:32:49.162
It's unbelievable, all that snow.

01:32:49.267 --> 01:32:51.667
And watch it end up
being a beautiful day.

01:32:55.173 --> 01:32:57.505
You want my confession first?

01:34:10.574 --> 01:34:13.600
<i>I don't know about heaven.</i>

01:34:19.583 --> 01:34:21.813
<i>But I do believe in angels.</i>

01:34:24.955 --> 01:34:27.856
Yeah. It's Daddy.

01:34:27.958 --> 01:34:32.258
<i>- Hey, buddy.</i>
- Is that your daddy?

01:34:40.437 --> 01:34:43.201
Not yet, Max.

01:34:47.778 --> 01:34:51.805
We have him. Max Payne is alive.
He's okay. We got him.

01:41:37.621 --> 01:41:39.885
It's good to have you back.

01:42:12.722 --> 01:42:14.815
Hey.
