01:09.019 --> 01:11.120
They're still
not slowing down.

01:11.155 --> 01:13.322
That rock slide
must'a really
spooked 'em!

01:18.028 --> 01:20.262
ONO: There's a dead end
canyon up ahead to the left!

01:20.297 --> 01:21.463
If we guide
the herd there,

01:21.499 --> 01:23.432
we can contain them
and calm them down!

01:23.467 --> 01:25.334
Great idea, Ono!

01:25.369 --> 01:27.169
Let's follow Ono's plan!

01:27.204 --> 01:29.037
Fuli, you take lead!

(RUMBLING)

01:52.062 --> 01:53.428
What's all the noise,
Makuu?

01:53.464 --> 01:55.063
I don't know.

01:55.099 --> 01:56.365
But I'm going to find out.

01:57.535 --> 01:59.368
KION: So is everyone
calmed down?

02:00.371 --> 02:01.370
Great!

02:01.405 --> 02:03.071
Then you're good to go home.

02:03.107 --> 02:05.407
Slowly this time, okay?

02:05.442 --> 02:09.244
That's right,
nice and slow.

02:09.280 --> 02:11.146
See ya, anty-lanty-lopes!

02:11.182 --> 02:12.281
Oh, hi, Makuu.

02:13.117 --> 02:14.216
Makuu?

02:14.251 --> 02:15.350
Makuu?

02:15.386 --> 02:18.153
I thought you'd be sleeping
through the dry season

02:18.189 --> 02:20.055
with the rest
of the crocodiles.

02:20.090 --> 02:21.256
Oh, I was.

02:21.292 --> 02:24.126
But then someone
drove a herd of antelope

02:24.161 --> 02:26.395
right past our sleeping cave!

02:26.430 --> 02:28.997
Hey! I think he might be
talking about us!

02:29.033 --> 02:30.032
He is.

02:30.067 --> 02:32.000
And using this canyon
was my idea!

02:32.036 --> 02:34.002
Whoa!
So it's all your fault!

02:34.038 --> 02:36.138
Bunga!
No, Bunga's right.

02:36.173 --> 02:37.272
It is my fault!

02:37.308 --> 02:39.308
I'm so sorry, Makuu.

02:39.343 --> 02:42.177
I forgot your float
was sleeping in that cave.

02:42.213 --> 02:43.378
We were sleeping.

02:43.414 --> 02:45.380
But now,
thanks to the Lion Guard,

02:45.416 --> 02:47.349
we're all wide awake!

02:47.384 --> 02:49.451
So whaddaya
gonna do about it, huh?

02:49.486 --> 02:51.453
Take it easy, Pili.

02:51.488 --> 02:55.090
Sheesh! Somebody got up
on the wrong side
of the cave.

02:55.125 --> 02:57.326
You can't blame him
for bein' upset.

02:57.361 --> 02:59.161
We did wake 'em up.

02:59.196 --> 03:01.430
And crocodiles usually
spend the whole dry season
in deep sleep.

03:01.465 --> 03:04.399
But once they're awake,
they can't go back
to their deep sleep!

03:04.435 --> 03:06.969
No way!
That's not true!

03:07.004 --> 03:08.103
MAKUU: But it is.

03:08.138 --> 03:12.107
We crocodiles need a whole
lot of water to survive.

03:12.142 --> 03:15.377
Since there isn't enough
to go around
in the dry season,

03:15.412 --> 03:17.179
we sleep through it.

03:17.214 --> 03:18.247
Whoa!

03:18.282 --> 03:20.148
Ono, you really messed up...

03:20.184 --> 03:21.250
ALL: Bunga!

03:21.285 --> 03:23.318
If Ono's the reason
we're awake,

03:23.354 --> 03:27.089
I say we deal with him
the crocodile way!

03:27.124 --> 03:28.156

03:28.192 --> 03:30.192
Oh, no, you don't!

03:30.227 --> 03:32.294
Pili!
Control yourself!

03:32.329 --> 03:33.996
I'll handle this.

03:34.031 --> 03:36.064
Yes, Makuu.

03:36.100 --> 03:38.000
Now that we're awake,

03:38.035 --> 03:41.069
we'll need water
for the rest
of the dry season.

03:41.105 --> 03:43.138
Any idea
where we'll find it?

03:44.508 --> 03:46.308
We'll go to my dad.

03:46.343 --> 03:47.476
Your dad?

03:47.511 --> 03:49.011
(SCOFFS)

03:49.046 --> 03:50.178
Pili...

03:50.214 --> 03:52.014
Yeah. My dad.

03:52.049 --> 03:55.217
He makes sure everyone
has enough water
in the dry season.

03:55.252 --> 03:56.385
Everyone?

03:56.420 --> 03:59.221
I know he'll take care
of you and your float, Makuu.

03:59.256 --> 04:00.355
He'd better.

04:00.391 --> 04:02.391
I'm going to speak
to King Simba.

04:02.426 --> 04:04.426
Stay here
until I come back.

04:04.461 --> 04:06.194
Stay here?

04:06.230 --> 04:07.329
But...
(ROARS)

04:07.364 --> 04:09.364
Yeah, okay, Makuu.

04:09.400 --> 04:11.033
Whatever you say.

04:11.068 --> 04:12.134
You're the leader.

04:12.169 --> 04:14.036
And don't you forget it.

04:18.108 --> 04:19.308
Don't worry, Ono.

04:19.343 --> 04:21.109
Everything's gonna be okay.

04:22.246 --> 04:23.278
I hope.

04:27.351 --> 04:30.352
Crocodiles awake
in the dry season?

04:30.387 --> 04:31.987
Something's up.

04:32.456 --> 04:34.323
Okay, they're gone.

04:34.358 --> 04:36.425
Now, this is how
it's going down.

04:36.460 --> 04:38.460
We're leaving
this dried-out canyon

04:38.495 --> 04:40.195
and finding us some water!

04:40.230 --> 04:43.332
But you just said...
Never mind what I said!

04:43.367 --> 04:45.067
Listen to what I'm saying!

04:45.102 --> 04:46.401
We're crocodiles!

04:46.437 --> 04:50.005
We don't wait around
for other animals
to tell us what to do!

04:50.040 --> 04:51.406
We take what we want!

04:51.442 --> 04:53.342
Yeah! He's right!

04:53.377 --> 04:55.177
Yeah, we do!

04:55.212 --> 04:57.179
So I say
we don't stay here!

04:57.214 --> 05:00.949
I say we spread out
and get ourselves
some water!

05:00.985 --> 05:02.084
Are you with me?

05:02.119 --> 05:03.251
ALL: Yeah!

05:03.287 --> 05:04.319
Then let's go!

05:06.023 --> 05:07.189
Hmm-mmm.

05:07.224 --> 05:09.157
Crocs on the rampage.

05:09.193 --> 05:11.960
Ushari will want to
hear about this.

05:11.996 --> 05:13.362
And so will Scar!

05:18.435 --> 05:22.104
Your spies
have done well, Ushari.

05:22.139 --> 05:25.007
This is very
good news indeed.

05:25.042 --> 05:27.376
Crocodiles detest
the dry season.

05:27.411 --> 05:30.078
And they won't easily
forgive Simba's son

05:30.114 --> 05:33.048
and his Lion Guard
for waking them.

05:33.083 --> 05:35.450
It could give us
an opportunity.

05:35.486 --> 05:36.985
Yes.

05:37.021 --> 05:39.087
That's what I thought, too.

05:39.123 --> 05:41.323
Have your Skinks
keep an eye
on the situation.

05:41.358 --> 05:44.292
Tell me immediately
if anything changes.

05:45.195 --> 05:46.294
You heard that?

05:46.330 --> 05:48.030
Yes, sir.

05:48.065 --> 05:52.067
The Lion Guard's
mistake could prove
most fortuitous for us.

05:52.102 --> 05:56.071
Perhaps it will even lead
to the end of Simba's reign.

05:56.106 --> 06:00.008
And then we reptiles
will rule the Pride Lands!

06:01.311 --> 06:03.945
Uh, under your
leadership, of course.

06:03.981 --> 06:05.080
Right, Scar?

06:05.115 --> 06:07.149
Of course, Ushari.

06:08.018 --> 06:09.117
Of course.

06:10.054 --> 06:11.953
(LAUGHS MANIACALLY)

06:16.994 --> 06:20.062
MAKUU: It really is
a matter of our survival,
Your Majesty.

06:20.097 --> 06:21.430
They sure have been
talking awhile.

06:21.465 --> 06:23.231
You think they're
talking about me?

06:23.267 --> 06:26.301
I'm pretty sure
they're more worried
about where the crocs

06:26.336 --> 06:28.336
are gonna live
for the rest
of the dry season.

06:28.372 --> 06:31.139
Yeah. But it's my fault
the crocs are awake!

06:31.175 --> 06:34.142
(WHIMPERS) What if I'm
exiled to the Outlands?

06:34.178 --> 06:36.178
Or fed to the crocs!

06:36.213 --> 06:37.279
Easy, Ono.

06:37.314 --> 06:39.147
None of that's gonna happen!

06:39.183 --> 06:40.282
You just made a mistake.

06:40.317 --> 06:41.983
Yeah, you heard Kion.

06:42.019 --> 06:44.119
You got nothin'
to worry about!

06:44.154 --> 06:46.054
Ono!
Come over here.

06:46.090 --> 06:47.222
But, I could be wrong.

06:47.257 --> 06:48.223
Oh, no...

06:49.259 --> 06:51.059
Perhaps,
you don't understand

06:51.095 --> 06:54.129
how much water
crocodiles need, sire.

06:54.164 --> 06:55.363
I do, Makuu.

06:55.399 --> 06:58.066
And I'll see
that you have it.

06:58.102 --> 07:01.269
Dad? What if Ono looks out
over the Pride Lands

07:01.305 --> 07:04.139
to see which watering hole
is least crowded?

07:04.174 --> 07:06.975
Then maybe that one
can go to the crocodiles!

07:07.010 --> 07:09.111
Excellent idea, Kion.

07:09.146 --> 07:11.046
Ono?
Yes, Your Majesty!

07:11.081 --> 07:12.147
It'd be my pleasure!

07:14.384 --> 07:17.352
I'm sure we can
find a place
for your float, Makuu.

07:17.387 --> 07:19.354
Thank you,
Your Majesty.

07:19.389 --> 07:22.390
I want to
settle this peacefully.

07:27.030 --> 07:28.130
(GASPS)<i> Hapana!</i>

07:32.202 --> 07:35.303
Kion! Your Majesty!
The crocodiles
are everywhere!

07:35.339 --> 07:38.273
They've moved
in to watering holes
all over the Pride Lands!

07:38.308 --> 07:40.075
Crocodiles?

07:40.110 --> 07:43.278
Makuu? I thought
you said you wanted to
settle this peacefully.

07:43.313 --> 07:45.080
I do! I do!

07:45.115 --> 07:46.181
Whoever is doing this,

07:46.216 --> 07:48.250
they're defying
a direct order!

07:48.285 --> 07:50.018
We'll have to
finish this later.

07:50.053 --> 07:51.987
I need to deal
with my float.

07:52.022 --> 07:53.221
Makuu, wait.

07:53.257 --> 07:55.123
We are very close
to a solution.

07:55.159 --> 07:57.292
Let the Lion Guard
handle this.

07:58.128 --> 08:00.328
Mmm. Very well.

08:00.364 --> 08:02.397
We need to split up
to gather them all.

08:02.432 --> 08:04.266
Till the Pride Lands end...

08:04.301 --> 08:06.201

This is our
watering hole now!

08:17.147 --> 08:19.014
We say
when you can drink!

08:19.049 --> 08:20.248
And if you don't listen...

08:20.284 --> 08:22.050
Lemme show you
what'll happen.

08:22.085 --> 08:24.085
KION: Stop
right there, Pili!

08:24.121 --> 08:25.987
This is not your place!

08:26.023 --> 08:28.089
Leave the impalas alone!

08:28.125 --> 08:30.325
It's our place now Kion.

08:30.360 --> 08:32.360

teach 'em who's boss!

08:37.134 --> 08:38.967
Okay, fine.

I'll teach you instead.

08:41.171 --> 08:42.204
MAKUU: Pili!

08:42.239 --> 08:44.206
What are you doing?

08:44.241 --> 08:46.374
What you should have
told us to do!

08:46.410 --> 08:48.310
I'm takin'
the water we need!

08:48.345 --> 08:50.111
Against my orders!

08:50.147 --> 08:53.248
You knew I was talking
to King Simba to get help.

08:53.283 --> 08:56.218
Yes. And together
we have found
a watering hole

08:56.253 --> 08:58.286
that you can
have for your own.

08:58.322 --> 09:00.922
PILI: Hmph!
SIMBA: Kion, will you
and the Lion Guard

09:00.958 --> 09:04.926
escort Makuu
and the crocodiles
to their dry season home?

09:04.962 --> 09:05.961
KION: Sure, Dad.

09:10.367 --> 09:11.399
See, Ono?

09:11.435 --> 09:14.135
Now the crocs have
their own watering hole.

09:14.171 --> 09:16.004
Everything's
gonna be fine.

09:16.039 --> 09:17.405
Just like Kion said.

09:17.441 --> 09:20.342
Maybe my mistake wasn't
such a disaster after all.

09:20.377 --> 09:22.244
This is a disaster!

09:22.279 --> 09:23.311
Oh...

09:23.347 --> 09:25.180
I know
it's crowded, Pili.

09:25.215 --> 09:27.215
But it really
is a good spot.

09:27.251 --> 09:29.284
My dad says
there's enough
water and fish

09:29.319 --> 09:31.319
to last you
the whole dry season.

09:31.355 --> 09:32.988
Oh, really?

09:33.023 --> 09:34.289
"Your dad" says so?

09:34.324 --> 09:37.225
Hey!
"His dad" is your King.

09:37.261 --> 09:40.328
Yeah. And besides,
there's tons of water!

09:40.364 --> 09:41.997

09:47.304 --> 09:49.437
At least you get to be
close to all your friends.

09:49.473 --> 09:52.173
Yeah.
Really close!

09:52.209 --> 09:54.309
See? I didn't even
get my feet wet!

09:54.344 --> 09:57.178
The honey badger
can't even get
his feet wet!

09:57.214 --> 09:59.180
What kind of
watering hole is this?

09:59.216 --> 10:00.448
I know it's not perfect.

10:00.484 --> 10:04.286
But it's the best way
to get our float
through the dry season.

10:04.321 --> 10:06.221
It's a compromise.

10:06.256 --> 10:07.989
Compromise?

10:10.427 --> 10:14.996
Pili,
the dry season is dry.

10:15.032 --> 10:19.067
There's not much
water anywhere
in the Pride Lands.

10:19.102 --> 10:20.368
This is our share.

10:20.404 --> 10:21.436
Share?

10:21.471 --> 10:23.371
We're crocodiles, Makuu!

10:23.407 --> 10:25.106
We deserve better!

10:25.142 --> 10:27.375
This is the best
we can get.

10:27.411 --> 10:32.113

you can try your luck
in the Outlands!

(ALL GASP)

10:36.420 --> 10:38.286
A<i> Mashindano?</i>

10:38.322 --> 10:40.322
So now you
want to fight me

10:40.357 --> 10:43.325
for leadership
of the crocodiles, huh?

10:43.360 --> 10:45.327
It's the crocodile way.

10:45.362 --> 10:46.494
Then I accept.

10:46.530 --> 10:49.464
Lake Matope at sunset.

10:49.499 --> 10:51.299
I know the tradition,
Makuu.

10:51.335 --> 10:53.468
Let's see if you
still know how to fight.

11:01.278 --> 11:03.278
(SCAR LAUGHS MANIACALLY)

11:04.381 --> 11:07.449
A<i> Mashindano?</i>

11:07.484 --> 11:10.151
At sunset. Tonight.

11:10.187 --> 11:13.054
You have brought me
valuable information.

11:13.090 --> 11:16.157
Well done, Skinks.

11:16.193 --> 11:17.992
Tell me, Ushari.

11:18.028 --> 11:22.130
Does the<i> Mashindano</i>
still attract large crowds
of Pride Landers?

11:22.165 --> 11:25.033
Yes.
Yes, it does.

11:25.068 --> 11:28.069
Some things never change.

11:28.105 --> 11:32.207
And even the royal family
attends the<i> Mashindano.</i>

11:32.242 --> 11:35.143
Correct?
Yes!

11:35.178 --> 11:40.215
So, it's the perfect time
to get rid of King Simba.

11:40.250 --> 11:42.250
How are we
going to do that?

11:42.285 --> 11:44.052
We needn't do much at all.

11:44.087 --> 11:48.256
Pili and his crocs
will do the dirty work
for us.

11:48.291 --> 11:50.191
You'd be surprised
what can be done

11:50.227 --> 11:54.162
while everyone else
is distracted
by the Mashindano.

11:54.197 --> 11:56.364
Ushari. I need you
to trick Pili

11:56.400 --> 11:59.401
into thinking he can
rule the Pride Lands.

11:59.436 --> 12:01.403
He'll rule the Pride Lands?

12:01.438 --> 12:03.204
Of course not!

12:03.240 --> 12:06.241
But we want him
to believe that he will,

12:06.276 --> 12:09.277
so he'll do what we want.

12:09.312 --> 12:12.213
Yes! Of course!

12:12.249 --> 12:13.348
Now...

12:13.383 --> 12:15.250
Here's the plan
I want you to plant

12:15.285 --> 12:18.353
in Pili's tiny little brain.

12:25.362 --> 12:27.295
You think Pili can win?

12:27.330 --> 12:29.030
I hope not.

12:29.065 --> 12:32.066
Yeah. Makuu's
become a good leader.

12:32.102 --> 12:35.370
And you've discussed
the plan with your crocs?

12:35.405 --> 12:37.071
Yeah, yeah.

12:37.107 --> 12:38.440
They know what to do.

12:38.475 --> 12:40.475
You're a smart snake,
Ushari.

12:40.510 --> 12:42.343
I like how you think.

12:42.379 --> 12:44.145
Thanks.

12:44.181 --> 12:47.015
I just want to be
on the winning side.

12:47.451 --> 12:49.117
And you will be!

12:49.152 --> 12:50.151
TAMKA: Pili!

12:50.187 --> 12:51.386
Time for the<i> Mashindano!</i>

12:51.421 --> 12:53.054
Great.

12:53.089 --> 12:55.290
You three know what to do
while I'm fighting, right?

12:55.325 --> 12:56.357
Oh, yeah!

12:56.393 --> 12:58.293
He'll never see us coming.

12:58.328 --> 12:59.327
Good.

12:59.362 --> 13:01.229
Once I defeat Makuu,

13:01.264 --> 13:03.398
not only
will I rule the float,

13:03.433 --> 13:06.968
but we crocs will rule
the whole Pride Lands!

13:07.370 --> 13:09.070
(LAUGHS MANIACALLY)

13:12.375 --> 13:14.209

13:14.244 --> 13:16.344
<i> Mah-shin-dah-no!</i>

13:16.379 --> 13:18.313
Here they come.
It's starting!

13:19.382 --> 13:21.149
All right, Pili.

13:21.184 --> 13:23.284
You wanted this<i> Mashindano.</i>

13:23.320 --> 13:25.987
Let's see what you got.

13:26.022 --> 13:27.355
(BOTH GRUNTING)

13:28.425 --> 13:29.424
ALL: Ooh!

13:30.494 --> 13:32.093
(BOTH GRUNTING)

13:34.197 --> 13:37.098
Okay. Split up
and meet at the target.

13:37.133 --> 13:38.333
Then we'll take him down!

13:40.136 --> 13:41.269
(GRUNTING)

13:42.372 --> 13:45.106
You think that's enough
to beat me, Pili?

13:47.344 --> 13:48.343
ALL: Ooh!

13:48.378 --> 13:50.478
Ugh! Crocodile violence!

13:50.514 --> 13:52.247
I don't want to watch this.

13:53.416 --> 13:56.117
Huh. That's strange.

13:56.152 --> 13:58.319
A crocodile leaving
the<i> Mashindano?</i>

13:58.355 --> 13:59.320
Wait a tic...

14:01.224 --> 14:03.124
ONO: What are you guys
up to?

14:04.327 --> 14:05.994
(PANTING)

14:06.029 --> 14:08.296
I just saw three crocodiles
leaving the<i> Mashindano.</i>

14:08.331 --> 14:10.331
Three crocodiles?
Yes.

14:10.367 --> 14:12.300
And nothing's
more important
to the crocodiles

14:12.335 --> 14:13.968
than the<i> Mashindano.</i>

14:14.004 --> 14:15.169
It doesn't make sense.

14:15.205 --> 14:17.071
It doesn't make sense.

14:17.107 --> 14:18.172
Keep an eye on 'em.

14:18.208 --> 14:19.240
Affirmative.

14:21.011 --> 14:22.410
Fuli, Beshte, Bunga.

14:22.445 --> 14:24.178
What's the kerbubble, Kion?

14:24.214 --> 14:25.980
Something's up
with the crocs,

14:26.016 --> 14:27.348
but I'm not sure what.

14:27.384 --> 14:29.150
We'll need to be careful.

14:29.185 --> 14:30.418
There's a lot of
animals here.

14:30.453 --> 14:33.288
We don't want to scare them
and start a stampede.

14:33.323 --> 14:34.289
Come on!

14:38.261 --> 14:39.260
<i> Hapana!</i>

14:40.330 --> 14:42.230
Kion!
I've figured it out!

14:42.265 --> 14:44.432
The crocs!
They're sneaking up
on your dad!

14:44.467 --> 14:46.034
My dad?

14:46.069 --> 14:48.236
Yes. And I think
they're going to attack him!

14:48.271 --> 14:50.104
<i> Heyvi kabisa!</i>

14:50.140 --> 14:51.239
Of course.

14:51.274 --> 14:54.075
They're using the<i> Mashindano</i>
as a distraction!

14:54.110 --> 14:55.143
Go around the crowd!

14:55.178 --> 14:56.411
They're moving to
ambush him from behind.

14:56.446 --> 14:57.412
Let's go!

14:59.449 --> 15:02.317
(CHUCKLES)
It's just like Pili said.

15:02.352 --> 15:04.319
Now, let's do this.

15:04.354 --> 15:06.054
(GRUNTING)

15:08.325 --> 15:11.326
If you're smart,
you'll stop right now.

15:11.361 --> 15:13.061
Well, we're not smart!

15:13.096 --> 15:14.228
So get out of our way.

15:16.066 --> 15:17.265
(GRUNTS)

15:25.008 --> 15:25.974
(ROARS)

15:27.210 --> 15:28.242
Kion?

15:28.278 --> 15:29.310
Kion!

15:29.346 --> 15:31.212
What is going on?

15:32.148 --> 15:34.015
Nothing now, Dad.

15:36.086 --> 15:38.019
They were trying
to ambush me.

15:38.054 --> 15:40.288
And use the<i> Mashindano</i>
for cover.

15:40.323 --> 15:42.123
But Ono saw it coming.

15:43.193 --> 15:45.360
Hmmm.
I know these crocodiles.

15:45.395 --> 15:47.996
They wouldn't have come up
with this themselves.

15:48.031 --> 15:49.163
(PILI GRUNTING)

15:50.367 --> 15:52.367
What's the matter, Pili?

15:52.402 --> 15:53.401
Can't move?

15:53.436 --> 15:55.136
(GRUNTING)

15:57.140 --> 15:58.306
Simba's gone.

15:59.342 --> 16:01.242
Fine.

16:01.277 --> 16:04.312
CROCODILES:
Makuu! Makuu! Makuu!

16:04.347 --> 16:07.415
Ha! This<i> Mashindano</i>
means nothing.

16:07.450 --> 16:09.350
While you were all
watching us fight,

16:09.386 --> 16:12.320
my loyal crocodiles
took down King Simba!

16:12.355 --> 16:14.389
Yeah. Yeah, you heard me!

16:14.424 --> 16:16.391
And with the Lion King gone,

16:16.426 --> 16:19.260
all of yous
answer to us crocodiles!

16:19.295 --> 16:20.328
SIMBA: Really?

16:20.363 --> 16:22.096
Is that how it works?

16:24.167 --> 16:25.266
What?

16:25.301 --> 16:26.401
But how...

16:26.436 --> 16:28.069
The Lion Guard!

16:28.104 --> 16:29.203
That's how!

16:29.239 --> 16:30.405
Your Majesty.

16:30.440 --> 16:34.208
I assure you,
I had no knowledge
of this scheme.

16:34.244 --> 16:37.045
I know.
This came from Pili.

16:37.080 --> 16:39.213
But since you are
the crocodile leader,

16:39.249 --> 16:42.183
I'll defer
his punishment to you.

16:42.218 --> 16:44.352
Pili lost the<i> Mashindano.</i>

16:44.387 --> 16:48.322
He and his followers
are no longer
welcome in my float.

16:48.358 --> 16:50.425
Do with him
what you see fit.

16:50.460 --> 16:52.360
Very well...

16:52.395 --> 16:54.462
Pili. You
and your followers

16:54.497 --> 16:57.231
are banished
from the Pride Lands.

16:57.267 --> 17:00.001
Leave now,
and never come back.

17:00.036 --> 17:03.004
But...
I said, now.

17:03.406 --> 17:05.039
Fine.

17:05.075 --> 17:07.175
But you haven't heard
the last of me!

17:11.181 --> 17:12.380
(CHITTERING)

17:15.385 --> 17:16.384
You!

17:18.088 --> 17:19.987
You said if we
attacked Simba,

17:20.023 --> 17:22.256
I could rule
the whole Pride Lands!

17:22.292 --> 17:24.959
Now what have I got?
Nothin'!

17:24.994 --> 17:26.127
Yes.

17:26.162 --> 17:29.263
It's too bad
you lost the<i> Mashindano.</i>

17:29.299 --> 17:30.298
"Too bad?"

17:30.333 --> 17:32.233
Is that all you got
to say about it?

17:32.268 --> 17:36.304
One battle
doesn't lose a war,
my reptile friend.

17:36.339 --> 17:39.107
Now you're
callin' me a reptile?

17:39.142 --> 17:42.143
Gimme one reason
I shouldn't eat you
right now.

17:42.178 --> 17:45.213
I can give you
all the reasons
in the Pride Lands.

17:45.248 --> 17:49.050
But first let me
show you something very...

17:49.085 --> 17:50.151
Very...

17:50.186 --> 17:52.320
Special.

17:52.355 --> 17:54.222
What kinda special?

17:54.257 --> 17:56.991
You'll have to
see it to believe it.

17:57.026 --> 17:59.127
This way...

18:02.265 --> 18:06.000
So what's this great thing
I'm supposed to see?

18:06.035 --> 18:07.335
A volcano?

18:11.274 --> 18:15.243
I'm much more
than a volcano.

18:15.278 --> 18:16.978
Wha... What?

18:17.013 --> 18:20.047
Welcome
to the Outlands, Pili.

Yeah. Welcome!

18:24.154 --> 18:25.286
What's going on?

18:25.321 --> 18:29.390
Don't worry, Pili,
we're all friends here.

18:29.425 --> 18:33.194

and your crocodiles.

for the dry season?

you know, it's...

I'm sorry.

of the crocodiles,

an example of you.

Yes.

21:17.427 --> 21:19.093
(WHIMPERS)

21:20.096 --> 21:21.262
I forgive you.

21:21.297 --> 21:23.364
Huh? You...

21:23.399 --> 21:27.201
You what?
You heard me.

21:27.236 --> 21:31.138
I told Makuu how your keen
sight foiled Pili's plan.

21:31.174 --> 21:33.240
We all make mistakes, Ono.

21:33.276 --> 21:37.144
But you also proved
yourself invaluable today.

21:37.180 --> 21:39.380
Thank you.
Oh! Well...

21:39.415 --> 21:41.048
I mean...

21:41.084 --> 21:42.049
Thank you!

21:42.352 --> 21:44.085
So, Makuu,

21:44.120 --> 21:47.054
is this the new
"crocodile way?"

21:47.090 --> 21:49.023
Perhaps it is, Simba.

21:49.058 --> 21:51.292
Perhaps it is.

21:51.327 --> 21:55.296
If you ask me,
it's a crocodile way
I could get used to!

21:55.331 --> 21:57.031
A-ffirmative!
