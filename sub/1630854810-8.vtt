WEBVTT

01:18.870 --> 01:19.788
<i>Cheers.</i>

01:20.580 --> 01:24.209
Gloria, you are the daughter
I wish I wanted.

01:24.292 --> 01:27.670
Mariluna, you are the friend
with a pool I finally have.

01:28.254 --> 01:30.256
And you really know
how to have a good time,

01:30.340 --> 01:33.134
which means you should throw a party.

01:33.218 --> 01:36.429
Maybe the kind with a splash of thanks
and a sprinkle of giving.

01:36.513 --> 01:38.264
We know you have family in town.

01:38.348 --> 01:41.726
Thanksgiving? They would never come.
They don't even know me.

01:41.810 --> 01:44.771
That's a bad attitude, Mar.
You gotta change your game.

01:44.854 --> 01:47.482
Invite them. Get to know them.

01:47.982 --> 01:51.194
It's never too late
to manifest your way to happiness.

02:01.412 --> 02:03.873
What do you mean
we're not doing Thanksgiving at home?

02:03.957 --> 02:04.791
You need a break.

02:04.874 --> 02:07.043
-So Lucia's making a great--
-Dinner?

02:07.669 --> 02:09.629
-Reservation.
-At a restaurant?

02:09.712 --> 02:11.798
Oh, way to phone it in, Lucia!

02:15.218 --> 02:16.344
Restaurant it is.

02:16.427 --> 02:17.762
I'm gonna go lie down.

02:23.101 --> 02:25.228
I'm sorry.
I know how much you love…

02:26.896 --> 02:27.981
love Thanksgiving.

02:29.274 --> 02:30.775
What if you had upsetting information

02:30.859 --> 02:32.694
someone needed to know
but didn't wanna know it,

02:32.777 --> 02:34.028
and you didn't know how to say?

02:34.112 --> 02:36.364
Is it the bowl with the face?
Did you see it?

02:36.865 --> 02:39.909
-I never should've eaten that chip.
-This isn't about the bowl.

02:39.993 --> 02:41.911
Ines, I've been down a dark bowl hole.

02:41.995 --> 02:44.289
I can't even look at them anymore,
and I love soup.

02:44.372 --> 02:46.291
I ate ice cream on a plate last night!

02:47.041 --> 02:48.042
Sorry, what's your issue?

02:48.126 --> 02:51.713
Tonio hired Rusty
to seduce Gloria off a Craigslist ad.

02:51.796 --> 02:52.630
Ines!

02:52.714 --> 02:55.466
What the hell?
How did you not tell me this sooner?

02:55.550 --> 02:57.177
-Or her?
-She hasn't talked to me in weeks!

02:57.260 --> 02:59.888
I thought her and Rusty would fizzle out,
but they're still together.

02:59.971 --> 03:02.307
-With Christmas approaching--
-He's gonna stuff her turkey.

03:02.390 --> 03:03.433
Exactly.

03:03.516 --> 03:04.893
Before he mashes her potatoes

03:04.976 --> 03:08.563
or puts his cranberries together to make
a sauce, I need to tell her the truth.

03:08.646 --> 03:10.732
So how do I tell her the truth?

03:10.815 --> 03:13.651
-Anonymous email, like you always do?
-I don't know what you're inferring.

03:13.735 --> 03:16.029
Yes, you do,
Mashedpotatolover460@gmail.com.

03:16.112 --> 03:17.280
Shit.

03:17.363 --> 03:20.408
You can't tell someone they're hooking up
with a hooker over email.

03:20.491 --> 03:21.784
That's basic friend knowledge.

03:21.868 --> 03:24.704
While we don't shame sex work,
because sex work is real work,

03:24.787 --> 03:27.916
if Gloria doesn't know about the sex work,
then there are consent issues.

03:27.999 --> 03:29.542
And we need to tell her directly.

03:29.626 --> 03:33.046
Wait, Rusty's faking it?
This all sounds suspect.

03:33.713 --> 03:34.631
I need proof.

03:36.591 --> 03:38.051
"Part-time help wanted."

03:38.134 --> 03:41.179
"Seeking attractive teenage boy
to flirt with teenage nieces

03:41.262 --> 03:43.181
to distract from their dad's cancer."

03:43.264 --> 03:46.392
-"Light housekeeping. Eighteen an hour."
-So he showed up off that ad?

03:47.352 --> 03:49.437
Oh, I'm really gonna judge him now.

03:49.520 --> 03:51.814
If you bone <i>and </i>clean,
you gotta make at least 25 an hour.

03:51.898 --> 03:53.107
They're not boning!

03:53.191 --> 03:54.734
He was walking funny yesterday.

03:54.817 --> 03:58.029
Walking funny means chafing
means they're still on second base.

03:58.112 --> 04:00.365
-The dry hump.
-I appreciate how knowledgeable you are.

04:00.448 --> 04:03.952
So I know Gloria's gonna appreciate
the knowledge you drop when you tell her.

04:04.035 --> 04:05.119
Oh! No. No way.

04:05.203 --> 04:07.705
I was dumb to be your messenger once
and got punched in the face.

04:07.789 --> 04:10.041
-We've all been punched.
-Stand behind her when you say it.

04:10.124 --> 04:11.459
She also donkey kicks.

04:11.542 --> 04:15.088
Yeah, Cam has weak shins
and also hates confrontation.

04:15.171 --> 04:18.633
Fact. My cousin thinks my name is Kevin,
and I've never corrected him.

04:18.716 --> 04:20.802
Demi should do it.
She's the most vertically challenged

04:20.885 --> 04:22.178
and could duck a blow the best.

04:22.262 --> 04:24.722
Or we leave the ad up on the computer,

04:24.806 --> 04:26.766
get her to read it,
and no one gets punched.

04:30.061 --> 04:34.107
What am I supposed to be looking at,
besides screenshots of boobs?

04:34.190 --> 04:36.359
Uh, it's a crazy Craigslist ad,

04:36.442 --> 04:38.861
and it's not here.

04:40.989 --> 04:45.076
Rusty calls. Gotta go, but I'll proofread
your crazy ad later when you find it.

04:48.496 --> 04:51.082
Hey, where's your creepy
sex worker wanted ad?

04:51.165 --> 04:52.458
Which one?

04:52.542 --> 04:54.711
Oh, the Rusty one. I deleted that shit.

04:54.794 --> 04:55.878
In the last 15 minutes?

04:55.962 --> 04:59.215
Yeah. When you guys left the room
to get Gloria, I saw it up on the screen

04:59.299 --> 05:01.718
and realized if she ever saw it,
she'd punch me.

05:04.137 --> 05:06.723
With no proof, there's no way
she'll ever believe me now.

05:06.806 --> 05:08.224
I saw it. I'm a witness.

05:08.308 --> 05:10.059
Who's ready to get punched?

05:10.143 --> 05:13.104
I mean, this,
plus no Thanksgiving at home--

05:13.187 --> 05:15.982
Wait, no Thanksgiving? What am I
supposed to do? My mom's working.

05:16.065 --> 05:18.359
-You can join us at the restaurant.
-Or join me.

05:18.443 --> 05:21.696
When I also join them at the restaurant.
I don't wanna eat my sister's vegan shit.

05:21.779 --> 05:23.489
-Forgot my jacket.

05:25.825 --> 05:27.785
What are you all conspiring about?

05:27.869 --> 05:30.955
Uh, Thanksgiving.
Nobody likes their plans.

05:31.039 --> 05:34.459
Let's go to Mariluna's. She's throwing
her first dinner party in 30 years.

05:34.542 --> 05:36.586
-You sure it's okay if we come?
-One hundred!

05:36.669 --> 05:37.754
This is so exciting.

05:37.837 --> 05:43.259
I am manifesting this Thanksgiving
to be the best Thanksgiving of my life.

05:44.427 --> 05:45.803
Until she hears about Rusty.

05:45.887 --> 05:48.598
Yeah, but Thanksgiving is
definitely the day to tell her.

05:48.681 --> 05:51.559
She'll be too tired from all the turkey,
so her punches won't be as strong.

05:51.642 --> 05:53.227
Huh! Yeah!

06:00.360 --> 06:02.362
Do you always keep your eyes open?

06:02.445 --> 06:06.908
No, I was just checking
to see if you were enjoying yourself.

06:06.991 --> 06:10.328
Well, I was kissing you, so yeah.

06:10.411 --> 06:12.205
Well, people can lie with a kiss,

06:12.705 --> 06:17.543
and I was also looking for a sign
to see if your feelings might be changing

06:17.627 --> 06:19.879
because changing feelings
is a you thing, right?

06:19.962 --> 06:23.007
Yeah, you're not wrong.
But I've been working on it.

06:23.091 --> 06:25.927
I'm listening to a relationship podcast,
and I'm also reading a book.

06:26.010 --> 06:27.470
You're reading a <i>book?</i>

06:27.553 --> 06:28.971
Oh no.

06:29.055 --> 06:32.016
Yeah, I know. Never thought
we'd be the couple to skip the fun part

06:32.100 --> 06:34.060
and get straight
to the read-a-book-to-fix-it part.

06:34.143 --> 06:35.436
When did it get hard?

06:35.978 --> 06:37.522
Well, it's always been hard.

06:37.605 --> 06:39.315
The hard part just used to be in my pants.

06:39.399 --> 06:42.902
And now it's in my head and my heart,
and, I don't know, it's hard because--

06:42.985 --> 06:44.737
We're missing the drama!

06:44.821 --> 06:46.239
-The sneaking!
-The lying--

06:46.322 --> 06:49.826
The will they, won't they?
Now it's just, they will, they did.

06:49.909 --> 06:52.537
And they're boring.
Also, what I'm gathering from the book

06:52.620 --> 06:55.456
is that I need to date someone who
takes me for granted and learn from it.

06:55.540 --> 06:58.292
And I don't wanna take you for granted.

07:01.337 --> 07:03.339
I guess we're just meant to be friends.

07:05.174 --> 07:09.554
Cameron, this was your premonition
coming to life! It was about us!

07:10.179 --> 07:11.013
Was it?

07:12.640 --> 07:15.560
Whatever you choose
will be the wrong choice.

07:16.060 --> 07:20.731
Demi! But ultimately,
you have to choose not to choose.

07:20.815 --> 07:25.403
No one. And that will be the choice,
and it will be right!

07:25.486 --> 07:26.362
Huh!

07:26.446 --> 07:28.030
And here I am. Single.

07:28.656 --> 07:29.824
Oh my God, it's all so true.

07:29.907 --> 07:33.035
Oh, I need to find that TikTok witch
and find out about the spring musical.

07:33.119 --> 07:36.914
Or maybe I don't wanna know
if I'm gonna play Aaron Burr. But I do.

07:36.998 --> 07:37.832
Oh my Andre!

07:37.915 --> 07:41.210
Benji wants me to meet his parents tonight
at Thanksgiving dinner!

07:41.294 --> 07:43.588
-And that's a bad thing?
-Yes!

07:44.172 --> 07:45.423
Breakups are hard enough,

07:45.506 --> 07:48.551
but if I meet his parents in this iconic
matching yet not matching ensemble,

07:48.634 --> 07:49.927
they're gonna love it and me.

07:50.011 --> 07:52.889
It'll complicate our breakup more,
'cause I don't wanna hurt his parents!

07:52.972 --> 07:54.432
Why do you wanna break up with Benji?

07:54.515 --> 07:56.726
'Cause he's a stage-five clinger
who likes to be around me

07:56.809 --> 07:58.394
and say nice things. It's a nightmare.

07:58.478 --> 07:59.812
Mm. Sounds familiar.

07:59.896 --> 08:01.481
Yeah. And…

08:01.564 --> 08:04.150
Oh my Andre. Is he me, and I'm you?

08:04.233 --> 08:05.151
Was I this needy?

08:09.489 --> 08:13.201
Wow, I guess I'm never
too evolved to hear the truth.

08:13.743 --> 08:17.121
Okay, how do I handle him?
What's my best path to a loving ditch?

08:18.164 --> 08:20.374
And what am I doing
with the both of you instead?

08:22.126 --> 08:23.711
It's so nice to finally meet you.

08:23.794 --> 08:26.047
Mario's so sorry he couldn't make it.
He's in New York.

08:26.130 --> 08:28.257
And Ruby is in Marin with friends.

08:28.341 --> 08:29.759
And the twins started fighting,

08:29.842 --> 08:34.388
so we just left them at home
as a gift to you and to us.

08:35.223 --> 08:37.099
Right, Ruben? Ruben!

08:37.892 --> 08:39.268
You look just like her.

08:39.894 --> 08:42.063
Your face is her face.

08:42.647 --> 08:44.607
-Yes.
-And you have a lovely home.

08:44.690 --> 08:45.566
Yes.

08:45.650 --> 08:47.568
Should… Should we come inside?

08:47.652 --> 08:48.611
Yes.

08:49.195 --> 08:50.488
Great! Great.

08:56.619 --> 08:59.288
Follow! Give them some cheese.
Maybe a hug.

09:00.248 --> 09:01.874
Mm-hmm.

09:01.958 --> 09:03.668
-Okay!
-Glo!

09:04.502 --> 09:06.003
We got a problem.

09:08.756 --> 09:10.299
That's where she hid it.

09:10.383 --> 09:12.885
Mariluna and I played a game
where we made up games,

09:12.969 --> 09:16.222
and hers was called Tupper-Where,
and I guess it's right here.

09:17.181 --> 09:18.266
-What?
-Yeah, I lost.

09:18.349 --> 09:19.976
Anyway, how are we gonna heat up the food?

09:20.059 --> 09:20.893
Well, I don't know.

09:21.519 --> 09:25.439
But we don't have to heat
my cashew casserole.

09:26.399 --> 09:28.859
-It can be served raw.
-This barf isn't gonna cut it.

09:28.943 --> 09:31.988
Tonight is Mariluna's first meal
with her family.

09:32.071 --> 09:35.324
It's her first impression,
which is the lasting impression.

09:35.408 --> 09:38.869
And we can't fail her by forcing everyone
to choke on something

09:38.953 --> 09:42.498
that smells like a crowded city bus
or the 15th hour of a porn shoot.

09:42.582 --> 09:44.417
I get it! It's not for you.

09:44.500 --> 09:45.835
It's not for anyone.

09:45.918 --> 09:47.753
You do know my boyfriend's in a gang.

09:49.338 --> 09:52.550
I did forget about that. Okay.
What are the sides for the casserole?

09:52.633 --> 09:56.012
Because this is also my first Thanksgiving
with a boyfriend.

09:56.095 --> 09:57.513
No offense, Davina,

09:57.597 --> 10:01.225
but he's a meat-eating man,
and he can't survive on love alone.

10:01.309 --> 10:02.727
Did you just say "love"?

10:03.311 --> 10:05.354
Yeah. Rusty said he's falling for me.

10:05.438 --> 10:07.815
Uh-oh. Are you falling for it?

10:07.898 --> 10:10.109
I mean him?

10:10.192 --> 10:12.528
Gobble, gobble, bitches. Got the bird.

10:14.447 --> 10:16.407
Where's the roasted turkey?

10:16.490 --> 10:20.328
-In my hands. Got it from the best deli.

10:20.411 --> 10:22.622
Don't go negative.
I'll get my mashed potatoes going and--

10:22.705 --> 10:24.373
We're gonna manifest a meal.

10:31.297 --> 10:33.341
-<i>Hey, baby.</i>
How are you feeling?

10:33.424 --> 10:35.009
Still a little nauseous.

10:35.092 --> 10:37.053
<i>Do you want me to come home? I can come--</i>

10:37.136 --> 10:39.472
Stay. Lucia's got me covered.

10:40.097 --> 10:44.602
Hey, I told you to have a nice time,
and Gloria promised me that you would.

10:45.227 --> 10:47.313
<i>So have fun. It's an order.</i>

10:48.439 --> 10:49.565
Already happening.

10:49.649 --> 10:50.900
<i>Take care of your sister.</i>

10:50.983 --> 10:52.943
I don't know what's
been going on with you two,

10:53.027 --> 10:55.488
but you're family, and that's important.

10:57.073 --> 10:59.116
Ines, promise.

11:01.494 --> 11:02.370
I promise.

11:04.747 --> 11:06.582
My sister must have loved you.

11:06.666 --> 11:09.877
Oh, I was her favorite, wasn't I, honey?

11:10.544 --> 11:11.462
Honey!

11:12.088 --> 11:13.214
It's uncanny.

11:13.798 --> 11:16.592
You're the exact same… but not.

11:18.386 --> 11:19.387
That's good.

11:20.179 --> 11:22.223
No, I know. I know. It's your favorite.

11:23.224 --> 11:25.351
I'm really glad you had a good time.

11:26.435 --> 11:28.562
All right. Night. Love you too.

11:29.313 --> 11:30.648
-Hey.
-How's your grandma?

11:31.148 --> 11:34.026
-Good. No fights with my mom yet.
-Mm.

11:34.110 --> 11:37.571
It's good they're spending time together,
but I miss my grams.

11:38.197 --> 11:41.534
Next year, I'm gonna keep her for myself,
and we can make her dinner.

11:41.617 --> 11:42.451
We?

11:44.203 --> 11:45.371
You and me.

11:52.169 --> 11:55.339
Move, people!
Everyone needs to work systematically.

11:55.423 --> 11:57.258
There is a science to this and math!

11:57.341 --> 11:59.135
It's science and math and a bit of art!

11:59.218 --> 12:01.470
-Ready for butter?
-Are you trying to sabotage me?

12:01.554 --> 12:04.056
Butter stays cold until the last minute
to ensure a good melt.

12:04.140 --> 12:05.725
-Right.
-Potatoes are cooling!

12:08.310 --> 12:11.188
You call this fork-tender?
Move, stat! We're losing heat.

12:11.272 --> 12:13.023
We need to get these taters
back on the stove.

12:13.107 --> 12:15.526
We still have 30 seconds to save them.
Move, people!

12:15.609 --> 12:18.154
-Move like you've done this before!
-I've never done this before!

12:18.237 --> 12:20.906
I'm gonna get some seaweed
while you take it down a notch.

12:20.990 --> 12:22.950
Same. My anxiety is on red alert!

12:23.033 --> 12:25.786
Good! Go! You disgust me!

12:34.378 --> 12:36.714
I'm starting to lose it.

12:37.298 --> 12:39.800
Is everything okay,
or is there trouble in paradise?

12:39.884 --> 12:43.554
Oh, me and Cam? No. No, we're great.
Better than ever. We broke up.

12:43.637 --> 12:47.349
What? You just said that so chill, which
is weird 'cause chill is not your color.

12:47.433 --> 12:51.937
True. But I'm chill
because I have faith and a secret.

12:52.021 --> 12:53.147
Can I tell you?

12:54.899 --> 12:58.068
When I was three, my <i>lola,</i>
who has a third eye like me,

12:58.152 --> 12:59.987
told me something right before she died.

13:00.070 --> 13:02.823
Did you also find out
that your grandpa is your dad?

13:03.324 --> 13:05.409
Never mind.
I have normal-age parents. Go on.

13:05.493 --> 13:08.621
Well, my <i>lola</i> told me
I was gonna have many hi's and bye's

13:08.704 --> 13:10.539
on the way to my forever penis.

13:10.623 --> 13:13.459
Your grandma talked about a forever penis
when you were three?

13:13.542 --> 13:15.711
Well, she was dying and fairly stoned.

13:15.795 --> 13:19.548
But she said he was gonna be the guy
with the wonky wink. He just blinks.

13:19.632 --> 13:21.217
That's silly. Who can't wink?

13:21.300 --> 13:22.426
My forever penis.

13:23.135 --> 13:25.095
Demi, can I borrow you for a sec?

13:29.683 --> 13:31.560
We gotta tell Gloria about Rusty.

13:31.644 --> 13:34.480
We gotta get her out of this fake
situation before she has real feelings.

13:34.563 --> 13:36.273
It's too late. She's already in deep.

13:36.357 --> 13:38.484
Which is why we should
let it play itself out.

13:38.567 --> 13:41.570
Telling her isn't gonna change anything,
and she'll hate and/or punch us.

13:41.654 --> 13:43.823
So what? She hates and/or punches us!

13:43.906 --> 13:45.616
-I can't do it.
-I'm not telling her.

13:45.699 --> 13:46.992
Tell her what?

13:49.495 --> 13:51.330
Do you think Mariluna
killed her husband too?

13:51.413 --> 13:55.167
Wait. You think she killed her husband,
and you still invited us to her house?

13:55.251 --> 13:56.919
Tonio's paying Rusty to date you!

13:58.629 --> 13:59.463
What?

14:00.381 --> 14:01.924
It's true, Glo.

14:02.007 --> 14:04.510
He put an ad up on Craigslist.
We all saw it.

14:04.593 --> 14:06.846
I think, in some Tonio way,
he was trying to help.

14:06.929 --> 14:08.305
Did you see Tonio write it?

14:10.349 --> 14:11.934
-No.
-Did you see it up on the site?

14:13.686 --> 14:14.562
No.

14:15.271 --> 14:18.941
-We saw it on Tonio's computer.
-Which my sister could have orchestrated.

14:19.024 --> 14:21.694
But I guess it's easier
to believe this crazy lie

14:21.777 --> 14:23.946
than believe someone actually loves me.

14:24.029 --> 14:27.283
This isn't love. It's a paycheck.

14:27.366 --> 14:28.242
Shut up, Ines!

14:28.325 --> 14:31.537
I know it's hard to hear,
but it's the truth.

14:31.620 --> 14:33.163
What do you know about the truth?

14:34.373 --> 14:38.252
I know I didn't tell the truth
about Rusty having a girlfriend,

14:38.335 --> 14:39.461
but I don't always lie.

14:39.545 --> 14:40.379
You're right.

14:41.130 --> 14:42.256
You can be honest.

14:43.924 --> 14:47.261
I saw what you wrote in my BuJo,
and that is true.

14:47.344 --> 14:49.305
You are a curse.

14:49.388 --> 14:51.265
You're the reason Mom died.

14:53.267 --> 14:54.268
Mom had cancer.

14:54.351 --> 14:58.230
Which magically appeared
when she was pregnant with you!

15:29.803 --> 15:33.265
-Are there more potatoes in the kitchen?
-There were, but they disappeared.

15:33.849 --> 15:37.478
Davina. She conveniently forgets
she's vegan when she's drunk.

15:38.729 --> 15:41.148
I put cream in the potatoes,
you fake vegan bitch.

15:41.941 --> 15:43.317
What?

15:45.903 --> 15:47.863
Hello, party people!

15:47.947 --> 15:49.114
Ooh.

15:53.661 --> 15:54.870
Oh!

15:55.704 --> 15:57.373
Don't worry. The robot will get it.

15:57.456 --> 15:59.500
-The robot!

15:59.583 --> 16:00.834
In life,

16:02.002 --> 16:06.215
when you get to be my age,
you have a lot of time to reflect…

16:07.341 --> 16:08.884
…and a good amount of heartburn.

16:10.010 --> 16:13.138
And that heartburn isn't just indigestion.

16:13.222 --> 16:15.474
It is also regret.

16:16.225 --> 16:19.561
Regret for the life you lived
and the life you didn't.

16:21.480 --> 16:22.731
To my sister's family.

16:22.815 --> 16:24.274
Your family.

16:24.358 --> 16:26.110
To my family.

16:28.112 --> 16:32.282
I promise not to regret
the time I have left.

16:33.200 --> 16:34.785
Mm.

16:35.369 --> 16:39.123
And we're going to go inner tubing

16:39.206 --> 16:42.668
down a mountain or a river,
depending on the season,

16:42.751 --> 16:46.046
wear matching pajamas on holidays…

16:47.214 --> 16:51.218
…and get a dog together
named Bark Wahlberg

16:51.301 --> 16:53.095
or Barky Bark.

16:54.471 --> 16:58.600
I've never had a dog,
which is why I would need to share it.

17:01.562 --> 17:03.480
And, Gloria,

17:04.189 --> 17:09.570
thank you for reminding me
that sometimes the glass can be half full

17:09.653 --> 17:12.364
and the creepy birthday room
can be half empty.

17:19.288 --> 17:20.706
What?

17:20.789 --> 17:21.749
Oh!

17:23.208 --> 17:24.293
I'm sorry.

17:25.419 --> 17:27.713
Now I'm done. Glasses up.

17:28.756 --> 17:30.215
Happy Thanksgiving.

17:30.299 --> 17:32.468
Happy Thanksgiving!

17:34.762 --> 17:36.138
-Um…
-Cheers.

17:36.221 --> 17:37.973
I'd also like to say something.

17:44.063 --> 17:47.149
So, I fell into this crew
because of a job,

17:48.108 --> 17:50.986
but it is so much more than a job.

17:51.820 --> 17:53.113
It's a family.

17:53.197 --> 17:57.076
I can't tell you guys how grateful I am
and how priceless--

17:57.159 --> 17:59.870
Priceless! Interesting choice of words.

18:02.539 --> 18:05.125
I'm sorry to interrupt,
but inquiring dummies in the room

18:05.209 --> 18:06.376
would like to know.

18:06.460 --> 18:10.047
Did my <i>tío</i> pay you
to flirt with and distract me?

18:13.884 --> 18:16.053
I know it's silly.
Just tell the truth.

18:18.013 --> 18:20.891
-Hey, I'm sorry.
-See, Ines? He's sorry.

18:23.227 --> 18:24.645
Sorry? What are you sorry for?

18:25.687 --> 18:29.233
I swear, as soon as I realized
how much I really liked you,

18:29.316 --> 18:30.484
I stopped taking the money.

18:30.567 --> 18:32.069
-As soon as--
-It's true?

18:34.321 --> 18:35.155
I'm gonna be sick.

18:35.239 --> 18:37.950
Hey. Hey, Gloria.
Hey, come with me. Let's talk this out.

18:38.033 --> 18:39.701
Talk about what?

18:41.078 --> 18:42.746
How you played me for pay?

18:45.374 --> 18:46.917
You know, it makes sense.

18:47.960 --> 18:51.463
How would you know what love is
when your own mother never loved you?

19:09.857 --> 19:11.150
Would anyone like seconds?

19:21.869 --> 19:22.828
I was wrong.

19:22.911 --> 19:25.664
No one can manifest their life
into a different reality.

19:25.747 --> 19:28.000
Bad things just happen to good people.

19:28.083 --> 19:30.127
Rusty isn't real.

19:30.210 --> 19:33.422
And my dad is dying, and I'm the dummy.

19:34.298 --> 19:36.300
I've been so stupid.

19:36.383 --> 19:39.261
I was born into shit,
and that's where I'm gonna die.

19:39.344 --> 19:40.554
Shut up!

19:40.637 --> 19:41.513
I'm serious.

19:41.597 --> 19:42.639
No, I'm serious.

19:43.223 --> 19:44.725
Shut up.

19:44.808 --> 19:48.437
That parrot you drew
looked like a dick with wings,

19:48.520 --> 19:50.272
but Rusty still let you win.

19:50.355 --> 19:53.567
If that's not love, I don't know what is.

19:53.650 --> 19:55.110
Oh, Glo.

19:55.736 --> 19:59.364
You owe it to yourself
to take a breath and…

19:59.448 --> 20:00.699
<i>Stop being such a bitch!</i>

20:01.658 --> 20:04.870
I know you're an actor,
but you need to drop the act.

20:04.953 --> 20:07.331
-No one's buying it.
-This wasn't an act.

20:07.414 --> 20:10.667
Dude! It's done.
She's never gonna forgive you.

20:10.751 --> 20:13.587
I took a job!
And when it felt wrong, I made it right.

20:13.670 --> 20:15.631
Unlike you. You never made it right.

20:15.714 --> 20:17.758
Bullshit. I came clean to you.

20:17.841 --> 20:19.051
I told you I lied.

20:19.134 --> 20:20.928
Yeah, but you didn't tell Gloria.

20:25.807 --> 20:26.683
I didn't know how.

20:30.604 --> 20:31.563
Neither did I.

20:38.820 --> 20:40.948
I'm still hungry.
Thanks to my selfish sister.

20:41.531 --> 20:43.242
I didn't eat your goddamn potatoes!

20:43.325 --> 20:44.159
Then who did?

20:44.243 --> 20:46.453
I don't care! I'm having Joker pick me up.

20:46.536 --> 20:49.706
See? Guilty, starch-eating whore!

20:49.790 --> 20:53.085
I don't know. I made a lot.
Can she eat ten pounds of potatoes?

20:55.879 --> 20:56.713
Are you drunk?

20:56.797 --> 20:57.923
No.

20:58.757 --> 20:59.758
Wink. Wink.

21:01.260 --> 21:02.511
-What?
-Nothing.

21:04.054 --> 21:05.514
Cam's my forever penis.

21:06.932 --> 21:08.725
-What?

21:09.518 --> 21:11.478
Tío Emilio has the potatoes!

21:11.561 --> 21:12.479
Who?

21:12.562 --> 21:13.897
The bowl with the face!

21:18.235 --> 21:20.612
-What?
-Time for everybody to stop drinking.

21:21.446 --> 21:25.325
I'm my own problem,
and I need to get out of my own way.

21:25.409 --> 21:26.243
You do.

21:26.743 --> 21:29.204
Because Rusty not taking the money
and admitting it

21:29.288 --> 21:31.707
actually proves how much he cares!

21:31.790 --> 21:33.417
And the dick bird.

21:33.500 --> 21:35.377
He picked the dick bird.

21:35.460 --> 21:39.464
I gotta stop being so judgmental
and controlling and get vulnerable.

21:39.548 --> 21:43.176
I can't let him think it's hopeless.
I need to ask for forgiveness.

21:43.260 --> 21:44.177
Bingo.

21:50.309 --> 21:51.685
-Ugh.
-You're welcome.

21:52.561 --> 21:54.187
I gotta go make some apologies.

21:54.271 --> 21:57.149
Go! Get your man.
And then get your friends.

21:57.232 --> 21:59.693
I have a surprise for you
that needs an audience.

22:02.529 --> 22:05.615
I don't know why it's so hard for me
to just own my mistakes.

22:06.742 --> 22:08.827
Maybe I'm worried I <i>am </i>my mistakes.

22:10.370 --> 22:12.748
You're not. You're human.

22:13.540 --> 22:15.459
Jealousy gets the best of all of us.

22:16.918 --> 22:18.420
I'm not jealous.

22:20.380 --> 22:21.673
Get off your high horse.

22:21.757 --> 22:24.801
I'm not the one who willingly took a job
under the guise of deceit.

22:24.885 --> 22:28.638
No, you're the girl who sabotaged
her sister 'cause she didn't get the guy.

22:28.722 --> 22:29.848
You think I'm still into you?

22:29.931 --> 22:33.226
Otherwise, why are you here talking to me
and not your sister?

22:33.310 --> 22:34.811
You're such a dick!

22:34.895 --> 22:36.772
Okay, look, you need to move on.

22:37.397 --> 22:41.777
Maybe if you get it out of your system,
you'll be done. So kiss me.

22:41.860 --> 22:43.153
Just do it.

22:43.236 --> 22:44.446
I don't wanna kiss you.

22:44.529 --> 22:47.699
Okay. Then don't, but move on.

22:50.243 --> 22:53.205
See? Nothing! Nothing's there.

23:02.130 --> 23:03.215
Rusty?

23:07.677 --> 23:10.263
I know. I know I was an asshole.

23:10.347 --> 23:11.932
You don't need to say any more.

23:12.015 --> 23:13.392
Please don't.

23:13.475 --> 23:16.895
But I said the most hurtful things
to both of you.

23:17.604 --> 23:20.065
I'm so sorry. Please forgive me.

23:26.696 --> 23:28.990
Come on. Mariluna has a surprise.

23:33.328 --> 23:34.621
Oh, come on.

23:37.207 --> 23:40.043
-Can we help you with that?
-No, it'll ruin the reveal.

23:40.127 --> 23:42.921
Probably what she said to her husband
before she killed him.

23:45.006 --> 23:46.258
Congratulations.

23:46.341 --> 23:47.676
What is that?

23:47.759 --> 23:49.094
A check, dummy.

23:49.761 --> 23:50.887
But why? What's it for?

23:50.971 --> 23:53.098
To show you bad things
aren't the only things

23:53.181 --> 23:54.266
that happen to good people.

23:54.349 --> 23:55.725
Good things happen too.

23:55.809 --> 23:58.437
Plus, I'm a rich bitch who loves games.

23:58.520 --> 24:00.939
Oh my God. Is this
one of those hidden-camera shows?

24:01.022 --> 24:03.650
There's no camera,
but there is a life-changing windfall.

24:03.733 --> 24:04.651
What does that mean?

24:04.734 --> 24:05.986
Money! How much?

24:06.069 --> 24:08.196
Well, that's up to all of you.

24:08.280 --> 24:11.658
I can either write you a check right now
for a million dollars,

24:11.741 --> 24:13.827
no strings attached, a gift, or--

24:13.910 --> 24:14.953
Yes!

24:15.036 --> 24:18.957
Or you could choose
to spend that million in three months

24:19.040 --> 24:20.750
with nothing to show for it.

24:21.293 --> 24:22.169
And win ten.

24:22.252 --> 24:23.545
Ten dollars?

24:23.628 --> 24:24.671
Ten million.

24:25.755 --> 24:27.507
-This is a joke.
-No.

24:27.591 --> 24:29.551
What does "nothing to show for it" mean?

24:29.634 --> 24:31.928
You can't buy anything you can keep.

24:32.012 --> 24:36.141
You just need to spend the money,
but you also can't waste it.

24:36.641 --> 24:37.684
That doesn't make sense.

24:37.767 --> 24:39.978
It does,
and it will if you choose that option.

24:40.061 --> 24:41.813
How hard is it
to spend money and get nothing?

24:41.897 --> 24:43.857
Ah, the story of my life.

24:44.441 --> 24:46.109
You will have to see to find out.

24:46.193 --> 24:49.654
But if you fail,
you get nothing, so choose wisely.

24:52.240 --> 24:53.074
We're gonna go.

24:53.658 --> 24:54.743
I'll walk you out.

24:59.998 --> 25:00.874
Gloria.

25:02.125 --> 25:06.379
While I'm gone, make your decision,
and then I'll sign that check.

25:07.506 --> 25:09.883
And a small one
that you can actually cash.

25:10.634 --> 25:12.511
-What?

25:12.594 --> 25:14.179
This is so much money!

25:26.274 --> 25:27.108
Damn.

25:27.692 --> 25:30.195
How many stacks do you need
to live here?

25:30.278 --> 25:31.238
I don't know.

25:32.155 --> 25:34.658
But that RollerWorld stash
would be a good start.

25:34.741 --> 25:35.992
You still with that shit?

25:36.076 --> 25:37.911
I heard Davina's sister.

25:37.994 --> 25:41.081
She said that Jamal kid and
that Martinez… grandmother…

25:41.164 --> 25:43.041
…found the RollerWorld money.

25:43.124 --> 25:45.252
And if they found the money,
then the money is real.

25:45.335 --> 25:48.296
Even if that… …old lady…
…had the cash, she's dead.

25:48.380 --> 25:51.675
Where's the loot? The… money…
…is Santos' money.

25:51.758 --> 25:55.053
Yeah, from 40 years ago!
That money is gone, homie.

26:04.437 --> 26:05.689
So much fun!

26:06.731 --> 26:09.359
Do you know what karmic coincidence is?

26:09.442 --> 26:10.819
It's not even a thing.

26:12.696 --> 26:13.530
Look.

26:14.864 --> 26:18.410
Dead woman walking with her family.

26:18.952 --> 26:21.204
That bitch faked her death.

26:21.288 --> 26:23.206
To keep our goddamn cash.

26:29.087 --> 26:30.130
Oh.

26:30.213 --> 26:31.590
I forgot the balloons!

26:31.673 --> 26:35.010
Guys, this is crazy.
This can change my life. Our lives.

26:35.093 --> 26:36.177
A million dollars.

26:36.261 --> 26:38.346
-Or ten.
-Which could change everything.

26:38.430 --> 26:40.348
Really change it, not just temporarily.

26:40.432 --> 26:41.975
What should I do?

26:42.058 --> 26:43.977
"Fortune favors the bold."
Like Cinnamon said.

26:44.060 --> 26:45.895
She was right about
all the other premonitions.

26:45.979 --> 26:47.314
No, she wasn't.

26:47.397 --> 26:51.192
She said someone was gonna die,
and no one's dead.

26:57.824 --> 27:00.118
Go away. This is private property.

27:00.201 --> 27:02.162
You have something that belongs to us.

27:05.123 --> 27:08.418
I thought there was more to your
premonition. Was there something else?

27:08.501 --> 27:12.130
Yeah, she said that one sister
will be the downfall of the other.

27:12.839 --> 27:14.466
You're confusing me with my sister.

27:15.050 --> 27:18.595
My name is Mariluna, not Marisol.
I don't have your money.

27:18.678 --> 27:21.514
You're not fooling anyone, lady!
Get us our cash.

27:23.683 --> 27:28.313
I can't believe this is happening.
My whole life, I expected bad things,

27:28.396 --> 27:30.982
and bad things happened,
and it was my fault.

27:31.066 --> 27:34.152
I manifested it. I was a curse to myself.

27:35.195 --> 27:37.155
If I'd had a little more trust in faith,

27:37.238 --> 27:39.908
I would have seen the good
that's always been around me.

27:43.495 --> 27:49.709
Hey… old lady!
Don't go there.

27:49.793 --> 27:51.503
<i>I've always bet on myself,</i>

27:51.586 --> 27:54.756
'cause betting on myself
has always been the safe bet.

27:54.839 --> 27:56.007
But today, it's over!

27:56.633 --> 27:59.636
Today, I'm gonna stop
just betting on myself

27:59.719 --> 28:02.222
and, instead, start betting on all of us.

28:02.305 --> 28:04.391
We thought this box was a curse,

28:05.183 --> 28:06.893
but it was actually a blessing.

28:06.976 --> 28:11.064
It's what brought us all here
to this moment. Our moment right now!

28:11.147 --> 28:13.024
Screw the easy money.

28:13.108 --> 28:14.567
Let's go big!

28:14.651 --> 28:17.737
We're gonna spend that million to get ten.

28:17.821 --> 28:20.240
We can change our lives for the better.

28:20.323 --> 28:23.702
Finally get what we deserve
and save my dad!

28:23.785 --> 28:25.495
We're not cursed!
