WEBVTT

00:04.338 --> 00:06.840
Excuse me.
No, Evan.
We still haven't heard from Yale

00:06.874 --> 00:09.009
on your obscenely early
admissions request.

00:09.043 --> 00:10.478
They'll come around.

00:10.511 --> 00:12.380
Actually I'm here
because I need to use your phone

00:12.413 --> 00:15.183
to call my mom.
Okay, are you sick,
have you soiled yourself,

00:15.216 --> 00:16.417
or do you have a note
saying that you've

00:16.450 --> 00:17.985
recently experienced
the loss of a pet?

00:18.018 --> 00:20.188
I left my recreational reading
at home.

00:20.221 --> 00:21.722
I wanted to finish
"The Art of War"

00:21.755 --> 00:23.157
before my
fencing match today,

00:23.191 --> 00:26.060
and I planned to read
8 1/2 pages at lunch.

00:26.094 --> 00:29.730
I'm gonna mark you down
for "sick".

00:32.366 --> 00:33.567
Hello?
Grandma?

00:33.601 --> 00:35.169
I need to talk to Mommy.

00:35.203 --> 00:36.670
Jessica: You don't need
to get me on the phone.

00:36.704 --> 00:39.273
I'm right here.

00:39.307 --> 00:40.708
Mommy? Oh, no.

00:40.741 --> 00:41.842
Am I having
the dream again?

00:41.875 --> 00:43.844
Pinch yourself.
I'm real.

00:43.877 --> 00:46.247
I'm your new principal.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.616
That's not technically
or even remotely true.

00:48.649 --> 00:51.352
The PTA wasn't giving me enough
power over the teachers,

00:51.385 --> 00:52.753
so I'm shadowing
Principal Hunter

00:52.786 --> 00:54.255
to see if I want
to take his job.

00:54.288 --> 00:56.557
A job like mine
at a different school.

00:56.590 --> 00:57.691
Sure.

00:57.725 --> 00:59.660
Grandma:

01:03.131 --> 01:06.634
Hairy-chested,
like I like them.

01:07.601 --> 01:09.970

01:11.172 --> 01:12.873

01:20.248 --> 01:22.983
* I'm fresh off the boat

01:24.318 --> 01:26.454
Eddie is going to be taking you
to your fencing match

01:26.487 --> 01:27.988
since I'm busy
being principal.

01:28.021 --> 01:30.324
Shadowing the principal.
He can bring
your war book then.

01:30.358 --> 01:31.925
Great, now there's
gonna be a bunch of drawings

01:31.959 --> 01:32.893
of boobs in it.

01:32.926 --> 01:34.695
Let's get you
back to class, kiddo.

01:36.430 --> 01:38.599
I take the long way
with honor students

01:38.632 --> 01:41.669
so they don't have to walk by
the "In School Suspension" kids.

01:45.273 --> 01:46.574
I don't want kids like Evan

01:46.607 --> 01:48.842
getting bad ideas
from the "trouble bubble".

01:48.876 --> 01:51.245
We should just move the
trouble bubble to the long way

01:51.279 --> 01:53.247
so we, the smart people,
can take the short way.

01:53.281 --> 01:54.815
'Kay, there's no "we".

01:54.848 --> 01:57.918
It's called "shadowing" because
you stay silently behind me,

01:57.951 --> 01:59.353
not giving opinions.

01:59.387 --> 02:00.821
Shadows aren't sentient.

02:00.854 --> 02:02.356
Peter Pan's was.

02:02.390 --> 02:03.557
Good boy.

02:05.993 --> 02:07.795
I'm lending Honey
all our throw pillows

02:07.828 --> 02:10.130
while she goes on bed rest.
-Great idea.

02:10.164 --> 02:11.832
We all need to be
supportive of Honey

02:11.865 --> 02:13.767
until the human inside her
is fully cooked.

02:13.801 --> 02:15.135
Bed rest is just a precaution

02:15.169 --> 02:18.206
because baby number two
is coming so soon after Maria.

02:18.239 --> 02:19.707
Doc wants me to lie low

02:19.740 --> 02:21.775
since my vaginal walls are
structurally compromised --

02:21.809 --> 02:23.377
Doctors!
Been there.
Cool, bye.

02:23.411 --> 02:25.613
These pillows are perfect.

02:25.646 --> 02:28.449
I know it's bed rest,
but I'm gonna be on the couch.

02:28.482 --> 02:30.851
Marvin got HBO
to help me pass the time.

02:30.884 --> 02:32.119
-Yeah.

02:32.152 --> 02:34.788
Have you heard of that new show
"The Sopranos"?

02:34.822 --> 02:36.324
It's crazy good.

02:36.357 --> 02:38.192
Like, you want to punch
a wall it's so good.

02:38.226 --> 02:41.028
-Oh, I've heard great things --
-We're not getting HBO.

02:41.061 --> 02:42.963
If I want to see Italians
being ruthless,

02:42.996 --> 02:45.032
I'll just watch the boys
playing "Super Mario Bros."

02:45.065 --> 02:47.301
Well, they're always
airing "The Sopranos".

02:47.335 --> 02:48.569
You should come over
and watch it.

02:48.602 --> 02:50.638
Oh, I would love to,
but I promised my mother

02:50.671 --> 02:52.373
I'd help catch a rat
she saw in her apartment.

02:52.406 --> 02:54.375
Louis!
It's getting worse.

02:54.408 --> 02:55.743
It took the toy!

03:02.583 --> 03:03.984
Jessica:
You are an hour late.

03:04.017 --> 03:05.486
We were supposed
to watch "Mulan".

03:05.519 --> 03:07.321
Yes!
It's about time

03:07.355 --> 03:09.156
Disney made a movie
about Asian people.

03:09.189 --> 03:12.159
Freaking mermaids and lions got
representation before we did.

03:12.192 --> 03:13.394
Well, to be fair,

03:13.427 --> 03:15.829
mermaids and lions were around
before we were.

03:15.863 --> 03:17.665
Well, now the whole schedule
is thrown off.

03:17.698 --> 03:20.268
Evan won his fencing match,
so I took him to the arcade

03:20.301 --> 03:21.335
to celebrate.

03:21.369 --> 03:22.770
I got some nacho cheese
on his mask,

03:22.803 --> 03:23.871
but I'll get it out.

03:23.904 --> 03:25.005
Celebrate?

03:25.038 --> 03:26.574
Evan always wins his matches.

03:26.607 --> 03:27.675
He's undefeated.

03:27.708 --> 03:29.410
Winning is average for him,

03:29.443 --> 03:31.679
and in this family,
we don't celebrate average.

03:31.712 --> 03:33.414
Then why does Dad
do a dance

03:33.447 --> 03:35.048
every time he opens
a pickle jar?

03:36.450 --> 03:38.419
I know you wanted
to come right home,

03:38.452 --> 03:40.120
my perfect little boy.

03:40.153 --> 03:42.022
Remember,
you don't have to go along

03:42.055 --> 03:44.191
with your brother's bad ideas.

03:44.224 --> 03:47.428
Bad ideas? We used his
épée to get quarters out
of the change machine.

03:48.596 --> 03:50.964
Go watch "Mulan"
at your grandma's.

03:50.998 --> 03:53.233
And tuck your feet under you!
I don't want you coming back

03:53.267 --> 03:56.270
with rat bites on your toes!

03:56.304 --> 03:59.039
You should know better than
keeping him out all hours.

03:59.072 --> 04:00.741
What's the big deal?
It's the arcade.

04:00.774 --> 04:02.910
And it's 6:00 PM!
That's how it starts!

04:02.943 --> 04:07.047
It goes arcade, pool hall,
drug corner, 7-to-10 in the pen.

04:07.080 --> 04:08.382
3-to-5 with a good attorney.

04:08.416 --> 04:11.752
I just don't want you poisoning
pure, sweet Evan

04:11.785 --> 04:13.387
with your screw-up juice.

04:13.421 --> 04:15.556
Whatever.
I'm gonna go sweep under my bed

04:15.589 --> 04:16.790
for loose CHEETOS.

04:19.960 --> 04:21.729
-All right, that'll work.
-Thanks for helping

04:21.762 --> 04:23.230
with rat supplies, Marvin.
-Yeah.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.098
Last night, it perched
on top of a cabinet

04:25.132 --> 04:26.900
and we got into
a staring contest.

04:26.934 --> 04:28.402
I think it winked at me.

04:28.436 --> 04:30.571
Well, I had to get good at
catching rats in my Navy days.

04:30.604 --> 04:33.674
If Cookie got to them first,
it was vermin stew for days.

04:33.707 --> 04:36.444
And he'd say the tiny bones
were quail, but we all knew.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.680
Truth is,
I'm terrified of rats.

04:39.713 --> 04:41.782
But I can't let my mother
see any sign of weakness.

04:41.815 --> 04:44.084
That woman likes to tease,
and her jibes have teeth.

04:44.117 --> 04:46.587
Yeah, well, some of the meals
Cookie made had teeth, too.

04:48.121 --> 04:51.291
Say, why don't I help you
catch that rat?

04:51.325 --> 04:53.961
I'd rather do that than
sit and watch any more TV.

04:53.994 --> 04:55.596
Marvin,
are you seeing this?

04:55.629 --> 04:57.765
You mean Allen wrenches
in the ratchet bin?

04:57.798 --> 04:59.099
This place is a damn mess.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.602
No, not that. This!
We should switch!

05:01.635 --> 05:04.137
You mean I catch the rat,
you watch "The Sopranos"?

05:05.172 --> 05:06.940
Genius! Yes!

05:06.974 --> 05:08.509
Okay. All right.

05:08.542 --> 05:09.977
Wait, why are you putting
everything back?

05:10.010 --> 05:11.345
Well, if I'm gonna do
the rat catching,

05:11.379 --> 05:12.546
I want it to be
a fair fight.

05:14.214 --> 05:16.684
I'll bare-hand this thing.

05:18.419 --> 05:20.788
The staff will invite you
to after-work drinks,

05:20.821 --> 05:23.457
but it's just a trap
to get secrets.

05:23.491 --> 05:26.460
I will trick them and drink
water and get all their secrets.

05:26.494 --> 05:28.529
So, maybe we up your sessions.

05:28.562 --> 05:30.030
What's going on here?

05:30.063 --> 05:32.733
Evan was disrupting
his classroom.

05:32.766 --> 05:34.668
Because the other students
are jealous

05:34.702 --> 05:36.169
of his superior knowledge.

05:36.203 --> 05:38.972
The boy can't help that fools
covet his intellect.

05:39.006 --> 05:41.208
No, because he made
repeated fart noises

05:41.241 --> 05:44.845
during Ms. Duggan's lecture
on "Where the Red Fern Grows".

05:46.346 --> 05:48.516
Where did you get that?

05:48.549 --> 05:51.184
I won it at the arcade.
Eddie helped me pick it out.

05:51.218 --> 05:52.820
Eddie, of course.

05:52.853 --> 05:54.922
Well, you leave me no choice.
Evan Huang,

05:54.955 --> 05:57.691
you are suspended from all
extra-curricular activities.

05:57.725 --> 05:59.192
But my fencing match tomorrow!

05:59.226 --> 06:00.494
He has a perfect record!

06:00.528 --> 06:02.830
I'm sorry, but this is
the hardest part of the job.

06:02.863 --> 06:05.533
This and breaking up pee fights
in the boys' bathroom.

06:05.566 --> 06:07.501
Evan,
why would you do this?

06:11.038 --> 06:14.007
Sorry.
She's jammed.

06:14.041 --> 06:15.409
I'll deal with this at home.

06:16.777 --> 06:17.878
You're grounded!

06:17.911 --> 06:20.548
-What?
-Pickles, anyone?

06:20.581 --> 06:23.584
Because the jar...is...open!

06:23.617 --> 06:25.185
I opened the jar.

06:25.218 --> 06:26.620
The jar is open.

06:32.159 --> 06:33.060
You can't ground me!
I didn't do anything wrong!

06:33.994 --> 06:35.228
Oh, you didn't encourage
your brother

06:35.262 --> 06:37.097
to buy a fart machine
and then use it in class?

06:37.130 --> 06:38.298
What?

06:38.331 --> 06:39.900
That's awesome!
What a little gangster!

06:39.933 --> 06:41.935
This is your bad influence.
Eh.

06:41.969 --> 06:43.303
I would've played
that baby over the P.A.,

06:43.336 --> 06:45.138
but, hey,
you gotta start somewhere.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.441
For real.

06:47.475 --> 06:49.042
I'm sorry Evan messed up
at school, and I'm --

06:49.076 --> 06:51.779
I'm sure it's hard for you,
but it's not my fault.

06:51.812 --> 06:53.380
Disagree.

06:53.413 --> 06:55.583
From now on, you're not allowed
to be alone with Evan

06:55.616 --> 06:57.551
without adult supervision.
That means me.

06:57.585 --> 06:58.719
Pickle Man doesn't count.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.588
What?!
That's complete B.S.

07:00.621 --> 07:01.722
So he got in trouble.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.423
Evan could use some trouble
in his life.

07:03.457 --> 07:04.424
It builds character!

07:04.458 --> 07:06.594
Character is for cartoons,

07:06.627 --> 07:08.962
like that wolf who can
never catch that tall bird.

07:08.996 --> 07:11.131
Why do you need an anvil?
Poison his fruit.

07:11.164 --> 07:12.833
Just stay away from Evan.

07:15.202 --> 07:17.270
You know, I saw a wolf
fall off a cliff once!

07:17.304 --> 07:18.706
It was not funny!

07:20.508 --> 07:24.177
Just brushing up on my
New Jersey geography
for "The Sopranos".

07:24.211 --> 07:26.480
Don't want any turnpike jokes
going over my head.

07:26.514 --> 07:29.116
It must be so easy
in there.

07:29.149 --> 07:31.519
Look, I'm worried
about Evan, too,

07:31.552 --> 07:33.086
but it all seems
pretty harmless.

07:33.120 --> 07:34.588
It isn't just today.

07:34.622 --> 07:35.956
Evan's 11.

07:35.989 --> 07:37.958
That's the age Eddie was
when we lost him,

07:37.991 --> 07:40.327
and now Evan is walking down
that same dark path.

07:43.196 --> 07:45.799
Evan, your eggs are ready!

07:48.135 --> 07:50.203
Moms, check it.
Fresh as hell, right?

07:50.237 --> 07:52.439
Mom, check it.
Fresh as hell, right?

08:01.549 --> 08:04.117
I can't let that happen.

08:04.151 --> 08:05.853
Tomorrow,
I'm gonna nip this in the bud.

08:05.886 --> 08:08.455
You know, I never understood
that expression.

08:08.488 --> 08:09.623
Buds turn into flowers.

08:09.657 --> 08:11.224
So why do we say it
about bad things?

08:11.258 --> 08:12.626
Are you doing
stand-up again?

08:12.660 --> 08:14.361
I told you,
you're too old for that.

08:18.732 --> 08:21.201
My understanding
from Dr. Cusamano,

08:21.234 --> 08:24.304
your family physician,
is that you collapsed...

08:24.337 --> 08:26.173
I think we got the better end
of this deal.

08:26.206 --> 08:27.975
We get to watch
this incredible show

08:28.008 --> 08:30.811
while those two catch a rat.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.546
I can't imagine what they're
even talking about.

08:32.580 --> 08:34.915
Well, my mom's probably
making fun of someone.

08:34.948 --> 08:37.651
We're still hearing
about the day Emery came
home wearing a kilt.

08:37.685 --> 08:39.920
Well, and Marvin's
probably gossiping.

08:39.953 --> 08:43.156
I can't hear any more about
Carol-Joan's fake front teeth.

08:43.190 --> 08:45.993
Some poor fool is being raked
over the coals by those two.

08:47.360 --> 08:50.163
It turns out bare-handing
the rat catching was a bad idea.

08:50.197 --> 08:51.832
Papa needs his work gloves.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.501
Hey, if you run out of things
to talk about with my mom,

08:54.534 --> 08:56.503
get her started
on how much she hates denim.

08:56.536 --> 09:00.173
Oh, we won't run out of things
to talk about, Dice man.

09:02.409 --> 09:04.578
Did he just called you
"Dice man"?

09:04.612 --> 09:06.747
Um, no, I don't think so.

09:06.780 --> 09:08.448
I'm pretty sure he did.

09:08.481 --> 09:09.717
No, I think
he was talking to you.

09:10.718 --> 09:14.254
Marvin will just tell you
tonight anyway, so...

09:14.287 --> 09:15.889
I'm Dice man.

09:15.923 --> 09:18.391
Back in the '80s,
I loved Andrew Dice Clay,

09:18.425 --> 09:20.227
and I would lip-sync along
to his albums

09:20.260 --> 09:21.695
to whoever would watch,

09:21.729 --> 09:23.230
which was mostly
just my mother.

09:26.900 --> 09:28.736
Clay: Jack and Jill
went up the hill,

09:28.769 --> 09:30.771
both with a buck
and a quarter.

09:30.804 --> 09:33.373
Jill came down with $2.50.

09:33.406 --> 09:35.208
Oh!

09:35.242 --> 09:37.477
Oh!
Mm-hmm.

09:37.510 --> 09:40.313
And who knows what
other embarrassing
stories they're telling.

09:40.347 --> 09:42.415
There was
the Weedwacker incident,

09:42.449 --> 09:43.917
the Shetland pony,

09:43.951 --> 09:45.418
my one-man show.

09:46.486 --> 09:47.621
My two-man show.

09:47.655 --> 09:49.222
Who was the other man?

09:49.256 --> 09:50.891
It was me in a mirror.

09:50.924 --> 09:52.893
"Two Lous".

09:52.926 --> 09:55.462
I can't believe I put my mother
and my best friend together

09:55.495 --> 09:56.930
with no chaperone.

09:56.964 --> 09:59.232
We should never have encouraged
her to learn English.

09:59.266 --> 10:00.734
Well, look, maybe you
should just

10:00.768 --> 10:02.069
go over there
and talk to them.

10:02.102 --> 10:03.303
Well, then they'll
talk about how I'm

10:03.336 --> 10:05.338
"the guy
who goes over there".

10:05.372 --> 10:07.340
Tony Soprano would know
what to do.

10:09.977 --> 10:12.846
Son, I'm going to need you
to wear a wire.

10:15.448 --> 10:16.917
I have to say,

10:16.950 --> 10:20.754
shadowing you
has been very educational.

10:20.788 --> 10:24.257
Do all principals get laughed at
by students as much as you do?

10:24.291 --> 10:25.693
No, ma'am.

10:28.561 --> 10:29.763
You.

10:29.797 --> 10:31.431
You can't
touch me now, old man.

10:31.464 --> 10:32.866
I'm out of
your jurisdiction.

10:32.900 --> 10:35.669
I can't touch any of the
students outside of high-fives.

10:35.703 --> 10:38.271
And even then,
I have to ask first.

10:38.305 --> 10:39.973
Most kids say no.
-Hmm.

10:40.007 --> 10:42.275
You can high-five me.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.778
Psych!
Eddie, get to the point.

10:45.979 --> 10:48.481
The fart machine incident
was my fault.

10:48.515 --> 10:49.783
Evan is blameless.

10:49.817 --> 10:52.485
I put him up to it,
for I am a bad influence.

10:52.519 --> 10:55.889
Therefore, I should receive
the punishment, not he.

10:55.923 --> 10:57.624
That was better in the car.

10:57.657 --> 11:00.560
But you see, Principal Hunter,
Evan is innocent.

11:00.593 --> 11:02.996
Of course Eddie
is at the bottom of this!

11:03.030 --> 11:05.799
The kid who put roast beef
in all of my file folders.

11:05.833 --> 11:07.467
You remembered!

11:07.500 --> 11:09.669
So, can we clear
Evan's record

11:09.703 --> 11:11.872
so he can participate
in the fencing match today?

11:11.905 --> 11:12.906
Yes.

11:12.940 --> 11:14.207
The last thing I want
is a blemish

11:14.241 --> 11:16.043
on an honor student's
transcripts.

11:16.076 --> 11:18.912
Come on, Eddie, let's go
tell Evan the good news.

11:18.946 --> 11:20.213
So, am I ungrounded?

11:20.247 --> 11:22.149
Yes, but you're on
a short leash --

11:22.182 --> 11:23.550
one of those
retractable ones

11:23.583 --> 11:26.219
where you think you're not
on a leash, but then you are.

11:28.688 --> 11:30.490
Do we really need
this tape recorder?

11:30.523 --> 11:33.093
Can't I just tell you
what Grandma and Marvin
are saying about you?

11:33.126 --> 11:34.494
What? Son, no.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.730
We need hard proof.
Otherwise, they'll just deny it.

11:36.764 --> 11:38.165
The way "Christophuh"

11:38.198 --> 11:40.400
denied shooting
the cannoli guy's foot off.

11:40.433 --> 11:42.169
-Great scene.
-It's the writing.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.171
Fine. You're just lucky
you caught me

11:44.204 --> 11:45.505
on my chest-shaving day!

11:45.538 --> 11:47.775
My front is
as smooth as glass.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.178
Perfect.

11:51.211 --> 11:53.513
Come on, little buddy.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.282
Come to Papa.

11:55.315 --> 11:57.017
Yo.

11:57.050 --> 11:59.686
How's it going in here?

11:59.719 --> 12:01.822
Dad sent me
to help with the rat.

12:03.590 --> 12:07.027
So, what are you guys
talking about?

12:07.060 --> 12:09.696
Oh, wait.

12:09.729 --> 12:12.833
So, whatcha guys talking about?

12:14.501 --> 12:16.904
You!
They were talking about you.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.738
You were right.
I recorded the whole thing.

12:18.772 --> 12:19.973
I knew it!

12:21.174 --> 12:23.743
Let's go shake down
those Chatty Cathies.

12:26.413 --> 12:28.448
Ah, middle school.

12:28.481 --> 12:29.783
Right over there
is where I gave Brian

12:29.817 --> 12:31.718
the biggest wedgie
of his life.

12:31.751 --> 12:33.553
God, we were so young.

12:33.586 --> 12:35.388
Hey, Evan.

12:35.422 --> 12:36.623
What are you doing here?

12:36.656 --> 12:37.991
Good news.

12:38.025 --> 12:40.660
You get to play in your fencing
match this afternoon.

12:40.693 --> 12:43.130
-What?!
-I took the hit for you, bro.

12:43.163 --> 12:44.731
So next time Mom tells me
to take a shower

12:44.764 --> 12:47.167
and I don't feel like it,
you're hopping in there.

12:50.838 --> 12:52.672
I-I can't fight today.

12:54.274 --> 12:55.775
What are you talking about?
Don't worry,

12:55.809 --> 12:57.911
I got the cheese smell
out of your helmet.
You're good to go.

12:57.945 --> 12:59.579
No!

12:59.612 --> 13:01.248
Look.

13:01.281 --> 13:03.951
I got myself suspended from
fencing on purpose

13:03.984 --> 13:05.685
so I wouldn't have to fight
today's match.

13:05.718 --> 13:09.289
I knew exactly what I was doing
with that flatulence emulator.

13:09.322 --> 13:11.258
What?
W-W-Why would you do that?

13:12.893 --> 13:14.127
She's why.

13:16.897 --> 13:18.098
You don't want
to fight a girl?

13:18.131 --> 13:19.867
No, I don't want you
to see me lose.

13:19.900 --> 13:21.434
I can't beat Carla.

13:21.468 --> 13:24.237
She'll ruin my perfect record,
and I can't not be perfect!

13:25.638 --> 13:27.474
Sorry, Mom --
about the double negative.

13:30.243 --> 13:32.012
Whoa!

13:32.045 --> 13:34.181
I'm not the bad influence
on Evan.

13:40.020 --> 13:40.720
Evan, you come out here
right now

13:41.855 --> 13:43.823
and fight this girl!
-Mom, I don't think

13:43.857 --> 13:45.458
this is how a principal
is supposed to behave.

13:45.492 --> 13:47.127
Shadow principal!

13:47.160 --> 13:49.562
A shadow principal who puts
too much pressure on her son

13:49.596 --> 13:51.198
and now he's terrified
to lose.

13:51.231 --> 13:53.300
I only want him to be
the absolute best

13:53.333 --> 13:55.468
at everything he
does all the time.
Is that so wrong?

13:55.502 --> 13:56.636
Yes!

13:56.669 --> 13:57.871
Evan needs
to learn to chill,

13:57.905 --> 13:59.306
or he won't be able
to roll with the punches

13:59.339 --> 14:01.141
when things
don't go perfect for him.

14:01.174 --> 14:03.543
"Chilling" is just giving
yourself permission to fail.

14:03.576 --> 14:05.478
That might be your technique,
but it's not mine.

14:05.512 --> 14:08.315
Well, your method just
sent Evan running into
the boys' locker room.

14:08.348 --> 14:09.749
He hates that place.

14:09.782 --> 14:12.485
He usually changes
in the car.
I need to go talk to him.

14:12.519 --> 14:15.488
Well, this is the boys' locker
room, and you're not a boy.

14:15.522 --> 14:17.324
Or am I?

14:17.357 --> 14:19.226
What are you doing?

14:19.259 --> 14:22.896
I'm cutting off my beautiful
hair so I can pass for a boy.

14:22.930 --> 14:25.265
Why isn't this sword sharp?

14:25.298 --> 14:28.268
Let me handle this.

14:29.869 --> 14:31.838
Chii. Chii-chii-chii-chii.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.740
Chii-chii.

14:33.773 --> 14:35.708
I'm replicating
the rat's mating call.

14:35.742 --> 14:37.010
Chii-chii-chii-chii.

14:37.044 --> 14:38.445
Well, don't do it too good,

14:38.478 --> 14:40.280
or they'll be all over you
like bears on honey.

14:40.313 --> 14:41.881
Aha!

14:41.915 --> 14:42.950
Caught in the act!

14:42.983 --> 14:44.084
What are you talking about?

14:44.117 --> 14:46.186
You've been in here gossiping
behind my back

14:46.219 --> 14:48.355
like a couple of biddies
folding laundry.

14:48.388 --> 14:50.023
Emery recorded
the whole thing.

14:50.057 --> 14:52.259
-Narc.
-No, don't change the subject.

14:52.292 --> 14:54.027
This is about you two
betraying me.

14:54.061 --> 14:55.628
I have proof. Listen.

15:00.233 --> 15:02.902
Emery, why are you
breathing so hard? I
can't hear anything.

15:02.936 --> 15:04.804
It was my first time undercover.
I was nervous.

15:04.837 --> 15:06.906
I didn't know Dad did that.

15:06.940 --> 15:08.575
That's hilarious, Grandma.

15:08.608 --> 15:10.210
Emery, you too?

15:10.243 --> 15:11.411
It was really funny.

15:11.444 --> 15:13.146
Your two-man show
sounded great.

15:13.180 --> 15:15.215
"Two Lous"?
Who wouldn't want to watch that?

15:15.248 --> 15:17.284
The Washington Post,
for one.

15:17.317 --> 15:20.387
"Two Louis Huangs
is two too many."

15:20.420 --> 15:22.155
Come on, Emery. Let's go.

15:27.927 --> 15:30.263
You're really
not gonna fight this fight?

15:30.297 --> 15:32.899
No, because if I lose,
which I will,

15:32.932 --> 15:34.334
Mom will be crushed.

15:34.367 --> 15:35.668
That's not gonna happen.

15:35.702 --> 15:36.736
Really?

15:36.769 --> 15:38.105
You think I have
a chance to beat Carla?

15:38.138 --> 15:39.606
Oh, no,
she'll destroy you.

15:39.639 --> 15:40.840
You'll probably cry.

15:40.873 --> 15:42.575
But Mom will be fine.

15:42.609 --> 15:44.244
She loves you
no matter what.

15:44.277 --> 15:46.113
In fact,
she's out there right now

15:46.146 --> 15:48.681
trying to saw her hair off so
she can come in and talk to you.

15:48.715 --> 15:49.816
Like Mulan.

15:49.849 --> 15:52.185
Yeah, like Mulan.
Exactly.

15:52.219 --> 15:53.253
You love that movie, right?

15:53.286 --> 15:55.488
Other than the dragon
being named Mushu

15:55.522 --> 15:57.424
and fireworks
saving the day, sure.

15:57.457 --> 15:59.092
Yes, it's not perfect,

15:59.126 --> 16:02.095
but it's more about female
empowerment anyway.

16:02.129 --> 16:03.263
Mulan's a badass.

16:03.296 --> 16:05.332
She made me feel things.

16:05.365 --> 16:06.599
We'll get to that later.

16:06.633 --> 16:08.001
The point is,

16:08.035 --> 16:10.503
nobody wanted Mulan to go to war
because she's a girl.

16:10.537 --> 16:12.272
Even though
she's an amazing soldier.

16:12.305 --> 16:14.141
If you refuse
to fight Carla,

16:14.174 --> 16:16.276
you're robbing her
of that chance to be Mulan.

16:17.577 --> 16:19.112
I never thought of it
that way.

16:19.146 --> 16:20.713
I'm the patriarchy!

16:20.747 --> 16:23.283
Yeah, you're the...that.

16:23.316 --> 16:24.951
Thanks, Eddie.

16:24.984 --> 16:26.953
Now I need to go out there
and give it my best shot,

16:26.986 --> 16:29.322
even if I get
my patootie kicked.

16:29.356 --> 16:31.358
Apologies for
the locker-room talk.

16:31.391 --> 16:32.592
Boys will be boys.

16:37.164 --> 16:39.466
* Woke up this morning

16:39.499 --> 16:41.368
* Got yourself a gun

16:41.401 --> 16:42.535
I'm like Tony.

16:42.569 --> 16:43.903
Can't trust nobody.

16:43.936 --> 16:45.172
Yeah.

16:45.205 --> 16:46.906
I would really love to hear
all about it

16:46.939 --> 16:48.075
when "Arli$$" comes on.

16:50.677 --> 16:52.812
We caught the rat!

16:52.845 --> 16:54.547
I count three rats.

16:54.581 --> 16:55.915
The one in the bag
and the two of you.

16:55.948 --> 16:57.984
To be clear,
I'm calling you rats.

16:59.352 --> 17:01.854
Louis, let us explain.

17:01.888 --> 17:03.656
We were talking about you.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.225
Sharing our favorite
Louis stories

17:05.258 --> 17:07.660
because the love of you is the
only thing we have in common.

17:13.032 --> 17:15.668
Lip-syncing Dice is genius!

17:15.702 --> 17:17.070
I'm gonna try it
with Don Rickles.

17:17.104 --> 17:18.371
Please don't.

17:24.411 --> 17:26.779
Aww, Mom.

17:26.813 --> 17:28.781
I guess I got a little paranoid
about family

17:28.815 --> 17:30.283
talking behind my back.

17:30.317 --> 17:32.051
Watching "The Sopranos"
didn't help.

17:32.085 --> 17:33.686
I was only laughing
at that "Two Lous" story

17:33.720 --> 17:35.122
because it sounded hilarious.

17:35.155 --> 17:38.358
Well, it was a searing drama,
but that means a lot.

17:38.391 --> 17:39.859
Um,

17:39.892 --> 17:42.462
could you two just hug
and shut up, please?

17:42.495 --> 17:44.364
-Yeah.

17:44.397 --> 17:45.898
What the hell --
bring it to the front.

17:45.932 --> 17:48.034
All right.

17:48.067 --> 17:49.636
I let the rat out.

17:49.669 --> 17:51.037
W-Why?

17:51.070 --> 17:53.973
Because I wanted
to look at him.

18:01.414 --> 18:02.949
I'm ready
to fight the match.

18:02.982 --> 18:06.119
Oh. Maybe you can be
a good influence.

18:06.153 --> 18:07.920
I have my moments.
Don't count on me!

18:07.954 --> 18:10.723
I'm sorry I used a fart machine
to get out of fencing.

18:10.757 --> 18:12.058
It's okay.

18:12.091 --> 18:14.093
I'm proud of you for going
through with the match.

18:14.127 --> 18:15.595
Even if I lose?

18:17.764 --> 18:19.266
Even if you lose.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.437
Still works!

18:24.471 --> 18:26.239
Come on, Evan!
Stab her!

18:26.273 --> 18:27.640
Stab her in the heart!

18:28.641 --> 18:29.742
Popcorn?

18:29.776 --> 18:31.110
Why are you
being nice to me?

18:32.945 --> 18:34.947
After spending the week
with your mother,

18:34.981 --> 18:36.416
I get it.

18:36.449 --> 18:39.519
Yesterday, when I got home,
I said awful things to my cat.

18:39.552 --> 18:40.953
Unforgivable.

18:40.987 --> 18:43.122
You get used to her.

18:43.156 --> 18:46.793
* Let's get down to business

18:46.826 --> 18:48.428
* To defeat
Referee: Salute.

18:48.461 --> 18:50.630
* The Huns

18:51.898 --> 18:54.934
* Did they send me daughters

18:54.967 --> 18:58.438
* When I asked for sons?

18:58.471 --> 18:59.772
Fence.
* Be a man

18:59.806 --> 19:02.675
* We must be swift
as a coursing river *

19:02.709 --> 19:04.177
* Be a man

19:04.211 --> 19:05.312
* With all the force

19:05.345 --> 19:06.779
* Of a great typhoon

19:06.813 --> 19:08.181
* Be a man

19:08.215 --> 19:09.616
Match.

19:15.888 --> 19:17.457
-Good match.
-Good match.

19:17.490 --> 19:18.625
Wonderful use of parry.

19:18.658 --> 19:19.792
You'll get me next time.

19:19.826 --> 19:21.294
I don't know --
You won't.

19:21.328 --> 19:22.829
I was just being nice.

19:28.935 --> 19:30.803
Gotta hand it to you, Evan --
you didn't cry.

19:30.837 --> 19:32.639
That's what the mask
is for.

19:32.672 --> 19:35.041
What are you two
waiting for?

19:35.074 --> 19:37.644
The arcade's only open
for another hour.

19:37.677 --> 19:38.811
Go celebrate.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.647
Really? But I lost.

19:40.680 --> 19:43.182
Yes, but you lost
perfectly.

19:44.217 --> 19:46.486
Come on, Bro. I'll show you
where Principal Hunter

19:46.519 --> 19:48.821
keeps his keys to his filing
cabinet on the way out.

19:48.855 --> 19:52.592
So I can keep track of the Yale
application myself.

19:58.130 --> 19:58.865
Marvin, Ma,
I'm sorry I doubted you.

20:01.100 --> 20:03.836
Emery, sorry I taped a
recording device to your chest.

20:03.870 --> 20:05.772
-It left a mark.
-Honey's here, too.

20:05.805 --> 20:08.275
Sorry I talked over
"The Sopranos".

20:08.308 --> 20:10.076
To make it up to all of you,

20:10.109 --> 20:12.445
I wanted to present
my two-man show.

20:12.479 --> 20:14.180
Since you love sharing
Lou stories,

20:14.213 --> 20:16.383
this will give you a lot
to chew on.

"Two Lous" by Louis Huang.

20:22.322 --> 20:25.692
Growing up in Taiwan,
nothing comes easy.

20:25.725 --> 20:27.226
Shut up, you baby!

20:27.260 --> 20:28.728
Who said that?

20:28.761 --> 20:30.863
You said that!

20:32.231 --> 20:35.702
Okay, I don't know what to do.

20:35.735 --> 20:37.604
Just kiss her, you fool.

20:41.508 --> 20:42.975
You said this was good.

20:43.009 --> 20:44.544
I remembered wrong.

20:44.577 --> 20:47.914
I can't believe
I'm alone on Christmas.

20:48.915 --> 20:50.750
You're never alone...

20:54.987 --> 20:57.590
Let me live, Mama!

20:57.624 --> 21:00.993
Maybe
if you acted like a man
for once in your life.

21:02.429 --> 21:04.431
You're drunk again, aren't you?

21:04.464 --> 21:07.233
I'm not drunk!

21:07.266 --> 21:08.768
You're drunk!

21:11.338 --> 21:13.105
We're drunk!

21:13.139 --> 21:14.574
I wish I was drunk.

21:14.607 --> 21:16.543
Yeah, this is the only way
I can get through this. Here.

21:18.010 --> 21:19.479
We love ya, Lou!

21:19.512 --> 21:23.316
Both of you! Bravo! Bravo!

21:23.350 --> 21:24.751
All right, thank you very much.

22:54.306 --> 22:55.041
Marvin, Ma,
I'm sorry I doubted you.

22:57.276 --> 22:59.912
