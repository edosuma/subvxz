WEBVTT

00:02.170 --> 00:03.971
Oh, if one more person
sends me

00:04.004 --> 00:05.739
an e-mail with "LFTD"
at the bottom,

00:05.773 --> 00:08.409
I'm gonna "K" somebody's "A."

00:08.442 --> 00:10.478
What's "LFTD"?

00:10.511 --> 00:11.712
Oh, come on, Grandpa.

00:11.745 --> 00:13.647
LFTD-- "Live for the Day."

00:13.681 --> 00:16.884
It's the catchphrase
of that rapper J'burnt.

00:16.917 --> 00:18.352
That's a terrible catchphrase.

00:18.386 --> 00:19.820
I could come up with something
so much better.

00:19.853 --> 00:21.155
I think you're missing
one crucial component

00:21.189 --> 00:22.723
of creating a catchphrase.

00:22.756 --> 00:25.593
People have to care
what you think.

00:25.626 --> 00:27.761
People care what I think.

00:27.795 --> 00:29.897
In fact, I'm a bit
of a trendsetter.

00:29.930 --> 00:31.232
Oh, please.

00:31.265 --> 00:33.867
Give us an example
of a trend you "set."

00:33.901 --> 00:36.704
The front tuck.

00:36.737 --> 00:38.339
Business in the front.

00:38.372 --> 00:40.774
Party in the back.

00:40.808 --> 00:43.444
You do that on purpose?

00:44.645 --> 00:46.714
Guys, guys, we've got
an announcement.

00:46.747 --> 00:47.748
Go on, you tell them.

00:47.781 --> 00:49.117
No, you tell them.

00:49.150 --> 00:50.384
No, I think it should
come from you.
No...

00:50.418 --> 00:52.386
I've lost interest.

00:52.420 --> 00:53.887
We're gonna rescue a puppy.

00:53.921 --> 00:54.888
Aw!

00:54.922 --> 00:55.723
Don't you already have
a dog?

00:55.756 --> 00:57.125
No.

00:57.158 --> 00:58.859
Somebody has a dog.

00:58.892 --> 01:02.062
Oh, no, wait, I was thinking
of Andi and Bobby's kid.

01:29.690 --> 01:31.859
Oh.

01:57.050 --> 01:58.686
Wait.

01:58.719 --> 02:00.821
It's a terrible catchphrase.

02:00.854 --> 02:02.823
All right, may-maybe you didn't
hear me correctly.

02:02.856 --> 02:05.293
"Chirp that bitch."

02:05.326 --> 02:06.860
It's ridiculous.

02:09.330 --> 02:10.764
What'd I just do?

02:10.798 --> 02:11.765
You locked your car.

02:11.799 --> 02:13.301
Lame!

02:13.334 --> 02:14.335
From now on,

02:14.368 --> 02:16.103
I'm gonna chirp that bitch.

02:20.308 --> 02:22.843
Hey.
Hi.

02:22.876 --> 02:25.446
Bobby, did you deposit
that tax refund check?

02:25.479 --> 02:27.215
What tax refund check?

02:27.248 --> 02:28.849
The check that I left
on the table

02:28.882 --> 02:30.318
with a Post-it on it that said,

02:30.351 --> 02:33.053
"please deposit this check."

02:33.086 --> 02:34.988
Right.

02:35.022 --> 02:36.357
You have no idea
what I'm talking about.

02:36.390 --> 02:38.792
No. You know what?

02:38.826 --> 02:40.060
It's probably upstairs
on the nightstand

02:40.093 --> 02:41.229
with all my other papers.

02:41.262 --> 02:42.563
Or it's at the office.

02:42.596 --> 02:44.031
It's probably at the office.

02:44.064 --> 02:45.233
If not upstairs.

02:45.266 --> 02:47.735
Bobby, this is a big check.

02:47.768 --> 02:49.970
I don't want it disappearing
into one of your many piles.

02:50.003 --> 02:51.872
And more importantly,

02:51.905 --> 02:54.375
did you get me
the Double Stuf Oreos?

02:54.408 --> 02:56.043
Right.

02:56.076 --> 02:59.247
Why do I even write Post-its?
I don't know.

03:01.949 --> 03:03.917
Look who I have.

03:05.052 --> 03:06.019
Oh, my God.

03:06.053 --> 03:07.221
You want to hold him?

03:07.255 --> 03:08.822
Yes, please.
Aw.

03:08.856 --> 03:09.923
Hi!
Okay.

03:09.957 --> 03:12.092
I'll be right back.

03:12.125 --> 03:14.027
I could just eat you up!

03:14.061 --> 03:17.164
Run for your life.

03:17.197 --> 03:19.032
All right, let's get
the two of us a treat.

03:23.036 --> 03:24.004
Whoa.

03:24.037 --> 03:25.606
What the hell is this?

03:25.639 --> 03:27.408
Well, they were gonna
kill these little guys.

03:27.441 --> 03:29.109
And I couldn't
just leave them there.

03:29.142 --> 03:30.911
And Lowell is okay with this?

03:30.944 --> 03:32.280
He will be.

03:32.313 --> 03:34.448
As soon as I find homes
for nine of them.

03:35.949 --> 03:37.718
I'll take this guy.

03:37.751 --> 03:40.921
Where will you
two be living?

03:40.954 --> 03:42.923
Aw, the mean little man
won't let me keep you.

03:42.956 --> 03:45.693
Why's he so mean, huh?
Why is he so mean?

03:45.726 --> 03:47.961
I'm gonna kill him.
You want to take him?

03:56.970 --> 03:58.205
Ms. Pearce?

03:58.238 --> 04:00.040
Oh, God.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.475
Deena from Accounting.

04:01.509 --> 04:03.277
I have the quarterly financials
for you to sign.

04:03.311 --> 04:04.678
Right, okay.

04:06.447 --> 04:07.815
Sign here.

04:07.848 --> 04:08.782
Uh-huh.

04:08.816 --> 04:10.551
And here.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.085
And initial here.

04:13.687 --> 04:15.255
And ini...

04:15.289 --> 04:16.757
ini...

04:16.790 --> 04:18.659
Okay, okay, oh, God.

04:19.860 --> 04:23.597
I'm sorry.
I just need a minute.

04:23.631 --> 04:26.066
Okay, what's wrong?

04:26.099 --> 04:28.669
I think my boyfriend Matt is
in love with someone else.

04:28.702 --> 04:30.304
And why would you think that?

04:30.338 --> 04:32.906
He said he's in love
with someone else.

04:32.940 --> 04:35.576
All right, well,
then dump him.

04:35.609 --> 04:36.977
Oh, you make it
sound so easy.

04:37.010 --> 04:38.746
It is. All you have
to say is, "Get out,

04:38.779 --> 04:40.914
go away, hit the road,
don't come back."

04:40.948 --> 04:42.850
Oh, thank you.
That's really helpful.

04:42.883 --> 04:45.953
Yeah, okay, bye-bye.

04:53.661 --> 04:54.695
I looked everywhere.

04:54.728 --> 04:55.829
That check is not
at the office.

04:55.863 --> 04:56.964
Yeah, well, it's
not here either.

04:56.997 --> 04:58.131
So, what am I gonna do?

04:58.165 --> 04:59.299
The good news is,

04:59.333 --> 05:00.601
on the drive home
from the office,

05:00.634 --> 05:02.035
I thought
of a better catchphrase.

05:03.203 --> 05:05.473
Extra crispy.

05:06.374 --> 05:08.642
It means cool.

05:08.676 --> 05:10.844
Will, I'm having a
serious problem here.

05:10.878 --> 05:12.346
Well, maybe you should
just relax

05:12.380 --> 05:14.982
and be extra crispy about it.

05:16.384 --> 05:18.519
Tell Andi you lost the check
and get it reissued.

05:18.552 --> 05:21.822
I can't, it'll be another mark
on the marital scorecard.

05:21.855 --> 05:23.524
What's the marital scorecard?

05:23.557 --> 05:25.793
Every marriage has
a marital scorecard.

05:25.826 --> 05:28.362
You keep track of how many times
your spouse messes up.

05:28.396 --> 05:30.063
That way, you have something
to rub in their face

05:30.097 --> 05:33.066
when you're having a fight.

05:33.100 --> 05:35.736
So the secret
to a happy marriage is spite?

05:35.769 --> 05:37.237
And TV.

05:42.410 --> 05:44.211
All right, that's him.

05:44.244 --> 05:46.880
Everyone get cute.
Really sell it, okay?

05:46.914 --> 05:48.248
Oh, come on, Scooter.

05:48.281 --> 05:51.351
You had all day
to lick yourself.

05:51.385 --> 05:53.587
Hey... babe.

05:53.621 --> 05:55.523
Guess what.

05:56.289 --> 05:58.091
There's so many dogs.

05:59.560 --> 06:01.161
And I love every single
one of them.

06:01.194 --> 06:03.263
Hello! Mwah!

06:03.296 --> 06:06.266
Hello, what's your name?

06:08.469 --> 06:09.703
I got it!

06:09.737 --> 06:11.071
The check?

06:11.104 --> 06:13.574
God, no, you're
never gonna find that.

06:13.607 --> 06:15.008
My new catchphrase.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.944
You ready?

06:16.977 --> 06:19.713
Kickin' it friendly.

06:19.747 --> 06:23.216
I actually miss
"Chirp that bitch."

06:23.250 --> 06:25.419
You're enjoying some beers
with your bros?

06:25.453 --> 06:26.787
You're kickin' it friendly.

06:26.820 --> 06:27.955
Ice cream with the gang?

06:27.988 --> 06:29.457
Kickin' it friendly.

06:29.490 --> 06:31.358
You're playing your banjo
on the front porch?

06:31.391 --> 06:32.793
You, my friend,

06:32.826 --> 06:35.696
are kickin' it friendly.

06:35.729 --> 06:38.065
I'd make fun of you,

06:38.098 --> 06:39.099
but I'm picking through garbage

06:39.132 --> 06:40.100
and you live here rent-free.

06:40.133 --> 06:42.002
So who's the idiot?

06:43.170 --> 06:44.371
You gonna help me out
here or what?

06:44.404 --> 06:45.839
Dude, I just got a manicure.

06:46.940 --> 06:48.208
If it were weird,

06:48.241 --> 06:49.477
would the word "man" be
a part of it?

06:49.510 --> 06:52.613
I don't know.
Tell me about menopause.

06:52.646 --> 06:54.648
You'll see--
"kickin' it friendly"

06:54.682 --> 06:56.249
is gonna catch on huge.

06:56.283 --> 06:57.651
No, it's not.

06:57.685 --> 06:59.787
I bet that I can make
one of our friends

06:59.820 --> 07:01.555
say "kickin' it friendly"
by the end of the week.

07:01.589 --> 07:03.791
You're on.
How much?

07:03.824 --> 07:06.026
I don't want to take
any of your manicure money.

07:07.294 --> 07:08.596
Loser grows a mustache.

07:08.629 --> 07:10.831
Ha! Deal.

07:18.706 --> 07:20.140
Pudding?

07:20.173 --> 07:21.509
Sure, why not?

07:30.117 --> 07:31.919
I'm sorry, Ms. Pearce.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.587
I know I shouldn't be in here.

07:33.621 --> 07:35.489
But I feel like you're
the only person I can talk to.

07:35.523 --> 07:38.792
It's over with Matt.

07:38.826 --> 07:40.661
Oh...

07:40.694 --> 07:43.030
Great, so you dumped him?

07:43.063 --> 07:44.464
And he got really pissed.

07:44.498 --> 07:46.934
And since he's my landlord,
he evicted me.

07:46.967 --> 07:48.335
I have nowhere to live.

07:48.368 --> 07:51.038
Wait, you didn't tell me
he was your landlord.

07:51.071 --> 07:54.274
I guess neither one of us
thought this through.

07:54.307 --> 07:57.144
Well, isn't there anyone
else you can live with?

07:57.177 --> 07:58.478
My mother.

07:58.512 --> 08:00.147
But she lives
with her boyfriend Trent.

08:00.180 --> 08:01.782
And Trent's mad at me
'cause I wouldn't agree

08:01.815 --> 08:04.885
to sell my eggs on Craigslist.

08:04.918 --> 08:07.788
Isn't there anyone else

08:07.821 --> 08:09.857
you can talk to about this?

08:09.890 --> 08:12.159
My sister said I should set fire
to him while he's asleep,

08:12.192 --> 08:14.227
but that's her solution
for everything.

08:14.261 --> 08:15.495
All right, all right.

08:15.529 --> 08:17.197
Look, here's
what you're gonna do.

08:17.230 --> 08:18.699
You're gonna tell your mom
you're moving in with her.

08:18.732 --> 08:20.968
Okay, well,
maybe I should practice first.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.469
You be me and I'll be my mother.

08:22.502 --> 08:24.304
Fine.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.740
Um, Mom, can I talk to you?

08:26.774 --> 08:27.841
Stop hitting on my boyfriend.

08:27.875 --> 08:30.644
I see the way you look at Trent.

08:30.678 --> 08:33.446
And I'm done.

08:36.717 --> 08:39.219
This is so awesome.

08:39.252 --> 08:40.387
Just hanging out.

08:40.420 --> 08:42.255
Cracking some cold ones,
you know.

08:42.289 --> 08:44.457
Kickin' it friendly.

08:45.726 --> 08:46.927
If you have time
to drink a beer,

08:46.960 --> 08:48.461
you have time
to look for a house.

08:50.598 --> 08:52.766
So, after visiting
three government Web sites,

08:52.800 --> 08:54.835
each of which crashed six times,
and filling out

08:54.868 --> 08:56.369
seven online forms,

08:56.403 --> 08:57.605
the I.R.S. is gonna

08:57.638 --> 08:59.006
send us a new check.

08:59.039 --> 09:00.540
Go ahead, say it.

09:00.574 --> 09:01.609
You're mad.

09:01.642 --> 09:03.844
I'm not mad, I'm just...

09:03.877 --> 09:06.780
I'm just disappointed.

09:06.814 --> 09:10.117
There it is.

09:10.150 --> 09:11.685
Bobby, it's just, it's so simple

09:11.719 --> 09:13.253
to be organized.
I mean, look at me.

09:13.286 --> 09:16.223
Look, I have my folder
of things that I've done.

09:16.256 --> 09:17.758
And my folder of things

09:17.791 --> 09:18.959
that need to be done.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.027
And that way,

09:20.060 --> 09:22.395
I know where everything is.

09:23.563 --> 09:25.398
Do you have to use the potty?

09:25.432 --> 09:27.968
A little.

09:28.001 --> 09:30.971
I was, I was talking to Charlie.

09:31.004 --> 09:33.073
Well, sometimes
it's hard to tell.

09:33.106 --> 09:34.441
Come on, Charlie.
I'll take him.

09:34.474 --> 09:35.709
Here we go.

09:35.743 --> 09:37.778
You want to put that on?
Yeah.

09:37.811 --> 09:39.980
All right.

09:44.284 --> 09:46.453
Well, that's unfortunate.

09:53.661 --> 09:55.595
So you had
the check all along?

09:55.629 --> 09:56.997
Yup.

09:57.030 --> 09:59.099
Oh, this is gonna be
a huge mark against me

09:59.132 --> 10:01.301
on the marital scorecard.

10:01.334 --> 10:05.839
You can win at marriage?

10:05.873 --> 10:07.641
Gosh, that makes monogamy

10:07.675 --> 10:10.177
seem almost worth it.

10:10.210 --> 10:13.346
Bobby is never gonna let me
hear the end of this.

10:14.547 --> 10:16.650
Although...

10:16.684 --> 10:18.518
Yes?

10:18.551 --> 10:21.554
A new check is being issued.

10:22.823 --> 10:24.992
So...

10:27.194 --> 10:29.596
Andi!

10:29.629 --> 10:31.699
That was so wrong.

10:31.732 --> 10:33.266
So manipulative.

10:33.300 --> 10:34.968
So me.

10:37.805 --> 10:39.106
Ooh.

10:40.207 --> 10:41.508
Another text.

10:41.541 --> 10:43.143
This woman has become the bane

10:43.176 --> 10:44.644
of my existence.

10:44.678 --> 10:46.546
I thought you told her to
move in with her mother.

10:46.579 --> 10:47.781
I did, but then

10:47.815 --> 10:49.316
the mother's
boyfriend moved out.

10:49.349 --> 10:50.951
And then the boyfriend
stole the mother's car,

10:50.984 --> 10:52.319
so she couldn't
get to work,

10:52.352 --> 10:53.821
so she lost her job at IHOP.

10:53.854 --> 10:55.723
And it goes on!

10:57.257 --> 10:58.358
I mean, this girl is like

10:58.391 --> 11:01.294
a Whac-A-Mole of problems.

11:01.328 --> 11:03.697
It's like putting
your finger in a dike.

11:03.731 --> 11:05.065
Did that once in college.

11:05.098 --> 11:06.867
Wasn't my thing.

11:06.900 --> 11:09.636
Well, I'm surprised
you haven't just fired her.

11:09.669 --> 11:11.038
Can't.

11:11.071 --> 11:14.074
Her scoliosis is technically
a "disability."

11:14.107 --> 11:15.642
Well, I guess you're
just stuck with her.

11:15.675 --> 11:16.777
Yeah.

11:17.945 --> 11:19.913
Unless I can pawn her off
on someone

11:19.947 --> 11:22.382
with more compassion
than common sense.

11:23.851 --> 11:25.753
Does human diarrhea medicine
work on dogs?

11:27.020 --> 11:29.923
Please say yes.

11:31.124 --> 11:33.360
And voilà.

11:33.393 --> 11:35.028
You want to pay us

11:35.062 --> 11:37.464
to hang out with the accountant
from your office?

11:38.365 --> 11:39.366
She has

11:39.399 --> 11:41.034
a name.

11:44.872 --> 11:46.106
Look, the point is,

11:46.139 --> 11:47.775
I will pay you
a generous hourly wage

11:47.808 --> 11:48.776
to comfort her.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.110
Think of it as babysitting.

11:50.143 --> 11:54.281
For the world's biggest,
craziest baby.

11:54.314 --> 11:56.383
Kate, we can't
take money

11:56.416 --> 11:57.785
to help a person
in need.

11:57.818 --> 11:59.219
He is right.

12:00.320 --> 12:01.354
Pick a dog.

12:01.388 --> 12:03.290
What?

12:03.323 --> 12:05.225
Come on, you have a need,
we have a need.

12:05.258 --> 12:07.795
I'll trade you a dog
for an accountant.

12:08.896 --> 12:10.197
Is this animal trafficking

12:10.230 --> 12:12.966
or human trafficking?

12:14.601 --> 12:17.137
Well, it does seem
like a big responsibility.

12:17.170 --> 12:18.872
But a dog can't talk

12:18.906 --> 12:20.908
and I can pay someone
to pick up after it.

12:20.941 --> 12:22.109
I'll take
that one.

12:22.142 --> 12:23.076
Oh, that...

12:23.110 --> 12:24.211
you don't want her.

12:24.244 --> 12:25.813
She's kind of mean.

12:25.846 --> 12:27.147
Mean?

12:27.180 --> 12:29.149
I like it.

12:29.182 --> 12:30.617
Come here,
you little bitch.

12:37.290 --> 12:38.658
Okay...

12:38.691 --> 12:39.659
Okay, you guys!

12:39.692 --> 12:41.228
Only five to go.

12:41.261 --> 12:42.462
Just found a home
for the retriever.

12:42.495 --> 12:44.097
Aw, damn it.

12:44.131 --> 12:46.900
I just started to make
a real connection with Gerry.

12:51.504 --> 12:53.306
If you like, Jules,

12:53.340 --> 12:55.342
we could all be hanging out,

12:55.375 --> 12:56.944
brainstorming ways
to place these dogs.

12:56.977 --> 12:59.179
You know, just
kickin' it friendly.

13:01.381 --> 13:03.917
Can you believe
that I was worried

13:03.951 --> 13:05.819
Lowell was gonna be angry
about the dogs?

13:05.853 --> 13:07.020
I mean, who would've thought

13:07.054 --> 13:08.455
he'd get sad
every time one goes?

13:08.488 --> 13:11.624
Kickin' it
friendly.

13:11.658 --> 13:14.194
It's just coming off
like Tourette's now.

13:16.129 --> 13:18.932
Guys, I want you
to meet Deena.

13:18.966 --> 13:20.600
Hey.
Hey.
Hi, Deena.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.502
Deena...

13:22.535 --> 13:24.371
you're going to go with
Jules and Lowell now.

13:24.404 --> 13:25.839
They're great,
you're gonna love them.

13:25.873 --> 13:27.875
Oh. Well, you haven't
steered me wrong yet

13:27.908 --> 13:30.210
and I know I need to meet
more people so I can...

13:32.679 --> 13:34.714
Have a seat.
- What's going on, Deena?

13:34.747 --> 13:37.117
Feel like kickin' it friendly?

13:37.150 --> 13:40.053
What is wrong with you?

13:44.357 --> 13:45.625
Oh, the check thing
is killing me.

13:45.658 --> 13:46.793
I mean, maybe I should tell him.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.228
I don't know.
What do you think?

13:48.261 --> 13:50.363
Ugh, do you hear
what I have to deal with?

13:50.397 --> 13:51.398
Who are you talking to?

13:51.431 --> 13:52.832
Dog.

13:54.234 --> 13:55.668
Oh, right.

13:55.702 --> 13:57.070
Have you decided on a name?

13:57.104 --> 13:59.206
Yeah. Dog.

13:59.239 --> 14:00.473
So, about the check...

14:00.507 --> 14:01.909
All right, gotta go,
Dog needs me.

14:05.045 --> 14:06.513
I'm sorry to throw you
under the bus,

14:06.546 --> 14:08.181
but there's only so much
drama about a check

14:08.215 --> 14:10.383
I can pretend to care about.

14:11.284 --> 14:13.386
Just look at me once.

14:13.420 --> 14:15.588
I love that you don't.

14:18.758 --> 14:21.061
Bobby...

14:21.094 --> 14:22.629
I have to tell you something.

14:23.796 --> 14:25.365
What is all this?

14:25.398 --> 14:26.900
Storage bins.

14:26.934 --> 14:28.435
Losing that check

14:28.468 --> 14:30.003
was the greatest thing
that ever happened to me.

14:30.037 --> 14:31.571
I'm gonna organize
everything.

14:31.604 --> 14:33.506
The closet, the nightstand,
the garage.

14:33.540 --> 14:35.442
What'd you have to tell me?

14:37.044 --> 14:39.246
That if you're gonna
organize the garage,

14:39.279 --> 14:41.548
you gotta get
bigger containers.

14:52.725 --> 14:54.962
It's like looking
into a mirror.

14:56.997 --> 14:57.965
Good evening,
Ms. Pearce.

14:57.998 --> 14:59.066
I just wanted
to tell you

14:59.099 --> 15:00.267
there are smiley-face cupcakes

15:00.300 --> 15:01.868
in the break room.

15:01.901 --> 15:04.037
They're an accurate
representation of how I feel.

15:04.071 --> 15:06.273
This is quite a change.

15:06.306 --> 15:07.274
I know!

15:07.307 --> 15:09.442
I've never been happier.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.478
Wow, yes...

15:11.511 --> 15:13.280
What?

15:13.313 --> 15:14.581
Oh, just something Lowell said.

15:14.614 --> 15:16.816
Anyway, have a super night!

15:21.288 --> 15:22.622
I know.

15:22.655 --> 15:24.591
It's a beautiful,
full-bodied Cabernet.

15:28.361 --> 15:29.963
Hey, Bob,
look at this.

15:29.997 --> 15:32.699
We got a nanny cam so that
we can check on the dogs.

15:34.001 --> 15:36.136
Oh, man, do they ever
stop licking themselves?

15:36.169 --> 15:37.637
Hmm...

15:37.670 --> 15:40.507
You would if you could.

15:42.042 --> 15:44.211
Hey, guys.

15:46.679 --> 15:49.516
This is just sad.

15:49.549 --> 15:52.085
That's a, uh...
that's a unique shirt.

15:52.119 --> 15:54.187
Yeah.
Was it free?

15:54.221 --> 15:55.855
No.

15:55.888 --> 15:58.025
No, I bought this because
everybody's saying this now.

15:58.058 --> 16:00.027
Oh. I haven't heard
anyone say that.

16:00.060 --> 16:01.161
Yeah. Me either.

16:01.194 --> 16:02.262
I do like
the sentiment, though.

16:02.295 --> 16:04.097
Right?
Who wouldn't?

16:04.131 --> 16:05.432
Yeah.

16:05.465 --> 16:07.434
It's kind of like
"hangin' out big-time."

16:07.467 --> 16:08.768
Oh, my God,
Lowell,

16:08.801 --> 16:10.337
did you just
make that up?
Yeah.

16:10.370 --> 16:11.371
That's really good.
It's like a catchphrase

16:11.404 --> 16:12.339
or something.
Is it?

16:12.372 --> 16:13.606
Yeah!

16:13.640 --> 16:15.808
Ooh, interesting.

16:19.679 --> 16:21.781
Uh, Kate, you can't
have a dog in here.

16:21.814 --> 16:22.982
Dog's not a dog.

16:23.016 --> 16:25.218
Dog is an upscale
life companion.

16:25.252 --> 16:26.386
I'll have a Chardonnay

16:26.419 --> 16:27.720
and Dog will take a Zinfandel.

16:27.754 --> 16:29.356
Hey...

16:29.389 --> 16:30.723
what did you say
to miserable Deena

16:30.757 --> 16:31.858
to make her so happy?

16:31.891 --> 16:33.326
Oh, we just gave
her some tips

16:33.360 --> 16:35.195
on how to learn
to live in the moment.

16:35.228 --> 16:36.863
Yeah. You know, just
"be in the possible,"

16:36.896 --> 16:38.065
"accept yourself,"

16:38.098 --> 16:39.532
and that there's
magic in the everyday.

16:39.566 --> 16:41.468
So you got here a subscription
to O Magazine

16:41.501 --> 16:43.503
and she's miraculously healed?

16:43.536 --> 16:45.205
Hey, don't get all worked up.

16:45.238 --> 16:48.175
We're all just sitting here
kickin' it friendly.

16:49.076 --> 16:50.577
You didn't
fix anything.

16:50.610 --> 16:52.179
You just put a Band-Aid
on a gaping wound.

16:52.212 --> 16:53.513
I mean,
Deena's still

16:53.546 --> 16:55.715
loveless, penniless, homeless,

16:55.748 --> 16:57.984
and her boss is a total bitch.

16:58.017 --> 17:01.088
You're right!

17:01.121 --> 17:03.223
You're right,
my life sucks!

17:04.857 --> 17:07.094
Kate... what do I do?

17:08.628 --> 17:10.763
Have you tried
kickin' it friendly?

17:12.199 --> 17:13.900
Nothing matters
anymore!

17:13.933 --> 17:15.868
Nothing!

17:15.902 --> 17:17.937
Kate, you have
to go after her.

17:17.970 --> 17:20.973
Oh, but our wine
just arrived.

17:22.209 --> 17:24.777
Fine.

17:24.811 --> 17:25.945
Deena...

17:25.978 --> 17:28.014
It's all gonna be...

17:28.047 --> 17:30.550
whatever, I don't know...

17:30.583 --> 17:33.786
You'll feel fine, whatever...

17:40.293 --> 17:41.694
Hi, Deena.

17:41.728 --> 17:42.862
Let me guess.

17:42.895 --> 17:44.631
Bad day?

17:45.898 --> 17:47.700
My sister set a small fire

17:47.734 --> 17:49.102
and it turned into a big fire

17:49.136 --> 17:51.371
and now she's in jail!

17:51.404 --> 17:53.606
Sounds about right.

17:55.942 --> 17:58.378
Oh, what a cutie.
Oh...

17:58.411 --> 17:59.646
She may look cute,

17:59.679 --> 18:01.047
but she's
actually vicious

18:01.080 --> 18:02.249
and doesn't really
like to be touched.

18:02.282 --> 18:03.716
Oh, she looks
really cuddly.

18:03.750 --> 18:04.817
Oh, no,
I-I wouldn't.

18:04.851 --> 18:06.219
No, no, oh,
no, don't...

18:06.253 --> 18:08.755
Oh...

18:08.788 --> 18:10.157
Oh, look who's so cute!

18:10.190 --> 18:11.258
I love her so much!

18:11.291 --> 18:13.260
This is the
sweetest dog ever!

18:13.293 --> 18:15.728
Apparently.

18:15.762 --> 18:18.331
Dog, you have proven
to be friendly,

18:18.365 --> 18:20.433
sensitive and loving.

18:20.467 --> 18:22.101
You are dead to me.

18:22.135 --> 18:26.173
You know, you two deserve
each other. Take her and go.

18:26.206 --> 18:27.940
Really? Are you sure?

18:27.974 --> 18:30.743
She's all yours.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.179
Hey, wait!

18:33.346 --> 18:35.715
That collar was expensive.

18:44.624 --> 18:45.925
What's this?

18:45.958 --> 18:47.694
It's a mustache comb.

18:47.727 --> 18:50.297
Get to know it
'cause pretty soon

18:50.330 --> 18:52.199
you're gonna be
kickin' it hairy.

18:53.966 --> 18:55.535
It's not over
till it's over.

18:55.568 --> 18:58.037
Hey, guys?

19:00.340 --> 19:01.774
Can you read
this aloud, please?

19:01.808 --> 19:04.411
"Lickin' it triendly"?

19:06.346 --> 19:07.547
That's a "K" and that's an "F."

19:07.580 --> 19:09.382
Read it yourself
and leave us alone.

19:09.416 --> 19:11.384
We're hangin' out big-time.

19:13.653 --> 19:15.288
You can't even cheat well.

19:15.322 --> 19:16.656
Behold.

19:16.689 --> 19:19.226
Organization.

19:19.259 --> 19:21.228
Losing that check
was the best thing

19:21.261 --> 19:23.029
that ever happened to us.

19:23.062 --> 19:24.797
You know, I probably could've
done it with one less container,

19:24.831 --> 19:26.899
but in the end, I thought
it'd be best to keep Cheerios

19:26.933 --> 19:29.202
and Honey Nut
Cheerios separate.

19:29.236 --> 19:31.238
I am actually
turned on right now.

19:31.271 --> 19:32.339
And...

19:32.372 --> 19:36.209
I got a new bin for recycling.

19:36.243 --> 19:38.378
Will, don't put your fruit

19:38.411 --> 19:41.047
with my recyclables.

19:41.080 --> 19:42.415
Not cool.

19:47.086 --> 19:48.087
Hmm.

19:48.120 --> 19:49.989
What's this?

19:50.022 --> 19:52.425
This looks a lot like the...

19:52.459 --> 19:54.661
the check
that we've been looking for.

19:54.694 --> 19:57.730
Oh, my God!

19:57.764 --> 20:00.267
I'm going into labor.

20:01.534 --> 20:03.870
Well, cork it up.

20:05.938 --> 20:08.241
I didn't lose the
check; you lost it.

20:08.275 --> 20:10.109
And then you tried
to destroy the evidence.

20:10.142 --> 20:11.944
You know what this
means, don't you?

20:11.978 --> 20:15.047
I get a mark
on the marital scorecard?

20:15.081 --> 20:16.883
A crime and a cover-up?

20:16.916 --> 20:18.718
This goes
in your permanent file.

20:19.986 --> 20:22.389
And I am done with the sorting

20:22.422 --> 20:24.223
and the cleaning
and the organizing.

20:24.257 --> 20:25.392
If you need me,

20:25.425 --> 20:26.559
I'll just be sitting right here.

20:26.593 --> 20:29.629
Kickin' it friendly.

20:29.662 --> 20:31.798
Yes!

20:36.102 --> 20:38.505
Son of a bitch.

20:45.345 --> 20:46.946
All right, everyone know
what they want?

20:46.979 --> 20:47.980
Yeah, I'll have the usual.

20:48.014 --> 20:49.215
Veggie burger.

20:49.248 --> 20:51.784
And I will have
a bowl of Zinfandel.

20:52.919 --> 20:55.488
God, I miss
that little bitch.

20:55.522 --> 20:57.023
Bobby, what are you having?

21:00.259 --> 21:01.561
Nothing.

21:01.594 --> 21:05.231
Everything I eat
tastes like hair.

21:05.264 --> 21:08.601
