00:10.886 --> 00:11.887
Stay down.

00:12.638 --> 00:15.891
It's very interesting,
a family emigrating to Mexico

00:15.974 --> 00:17.768
rather than in the other direction.

00:17.851 --> 00:19.144
It's a novel concept.

00:19.228 --> 00:22.606
If you do what he say,
if you cross the border, you're gonna die.

00:22.689 --> 00:24.316
You and your kids are gonna die.

00:24.399 --> 00:27.736
The more I like the characters
that I'm writing,

00:27.819 --> 00:30.405
the more peril I wanna expose them to.

00:30.489 --> 00:34.910
You wanna see what any given character
is gonna do in a given situation.

00:34.993 --> 00:36.286
You need to drink.

00:38.622 --> 00:41.124
You're no good to the kids
if you're dead in the desert.

00:41.792 --> 00:45.629
This has been a really hard shoot.
There's one way of shooting a show,

00:45.712 --> 00:47.840
which is on soundstages in Burbank.

00:47.923 --> 00:50.342
You want it to look like the desert,
you drive a little bit out of LA.

00:50.425 --> 00:51.802
This is wildly different.

00:51.885 --> 00:54.555
We're going to all these
different places, and it's so diverse.

00:54.638 --> 00:56.473
It was just so exciting.

00:56.557 --> 00:59.643
We were kind of having a similar
experience to the Foxes themselves,

00:59.726 --> 01:03.272
which is, it started in California,
shooting that, "Oh, that's lovely."

01:03.355 --> 01:04.647
Then we went to

01:04.730 --> 01:08.026
this border town in Mexicali
to shoot some of the desert episode.

01:08.110 --> 01:13.198
It has this enormous scope
and this enormous canvas.

01:13.699 --> 01:15.075
I often have--

01:15.158 --> 01:17.828
Often have nightmares
thinking about that episode.

01:17.911 --> 01:22.499
We had a fantastic director
that just put us through hell,

01:22.583 --> 01:24.293
because that's what they
were going through,

01:24.376 --> 01:27.171
and that's what
they decided they would do to us.

01:27.254 --> 01:31.550
So we would eat cactus fruit,
and it was thirsty, and sleeping in a bus.

01:33.468 --> 01:36.638
Don't do that. Moisture makes it worse.

01:37.514 --> 01:40.225
They'd surround us in the environment
that our characters are in.

01:40.309 --> 01:42.895
I definitely think
that it kinda bound us as a group

01:42.978 --> 01:44.938
and makes us seem more like a family.

01:45.022 --> 01:46.732
When you're sweating,
you're really sweating,

01:46.815 --> 01:50.068
when you're cold, you're really cold,
when you're hot, you're really hot.

01:50.152 --> 01:52.571
Hopefully that translates
in the show itself.
