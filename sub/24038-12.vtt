WEBVTT

00:09.217 --> 00:10.218
[Lucy] Wyatt?

00:11.762 --> 00:12.847
Wyatt?

00:15.641 --> 00:17.058
Wyatt?

00:17.100 --> 00:19.353
Are you okay?

00:19.394 --> 00:22.940
Emma set us up.

00:19.394 --> 00:22.940
The pilot, he was

00:19.394 --> 00:22.940
working for her.

00:22.982 --> 00:25.860
It's okay. It's okay.

00:22.982 --> 00:25.860
It's okay. He's dead.

00:25.901 --> 00:28.028
You wrestled

00:25.901 --> 00:28.028
the controls away from him.

00:29.237 --> 00:31.699
-Still crashed.

00:29.237 --> 00:31.699
-We would have died.

00:32.366 --> 00:33.408
You saved us.

00:34.702 --> 00:36.704
Rufus and Jiya? [grunts]

00:36.745 --> 00:38.246
They're okay. They're okay.

00:36.745 --> 00:38.246
They're okay.

00:40.165 --> 00:42.626
-Are you okay?

00:40.165 --> 00:42.626
-Yeah.

00:45.337 --> 00:46.922
-All right. Come on.

00:45.337 --> 00:46.922
-Okay. Ow!

00:59.935 --> 01:01.436
[Jiya panting]

01:01.478 --> 01:05.566
-Does it hurt?

01:01.478 --> 01:05.566
-No, the, uh, cold air,

01:01.478 --> 01:05.566
it's very numbing.

01:08.610 --> 01:09.653
[grunts]

01:12.322 --> 01:13.991
Here, let me see.

01:14.033 --> 01:16.618
[indistinct radio chatter

01:14.033 --> 01:16.618
and static]

01:16.660 --> 01:18.996
When did you become G.I. Jane?

01:19.038 --> 01:21.623
Chinatown.

01:19.038 --> 01:21.623
My friend Molly taught me.

01:21.665 --> 01:24.251
Doctors were expensive.

01:24.292 --> 01:25.669
Wonder what happened to her.

01:25.711 --> 01:29.631
She died. Bubonic plague.

01:25.711 --> 01:29.631
I looked it up.

01:29.673 --> 01:32.551
According to the chopper radio,

01:29.673 --> 01:32.551
<i>Meredith Victory</i> sailed

01:29.673 --> 01:32.551
yesterday.

01:32.593 --> 01:35.930
With 14,000 people,

01:32.593 --> 01:35.930
just like she was supposed to.

01:35.971 --> 01:39.016
So the pilot, North Korea,

01:35.971 --> 01:39.016
all of it was about

01:35.971 --> 01:39.016
her killing us.

01:39.058 --> 01:41.936
It makes sense.

01:39.058 --> 01:41.936
Emma wants to get us

01:39.058 --> 01:41.936
out of the way.

01:41.977 --> 01:43.771
Well, it doesn't get

01:41.977 --> 01:43.771
much more out of the way

01:43.812 --> 01:46.105
than North Korea

01:43.812 --> 01:46.105
in the dead of night.

01:46.147 --> 01:47.608
[Wyatt] Sleeper's dead.

01:47.649 --> 01:49.484
Only thing left to do is find

01:47.649 --> 01:49.484
the<i> Lifeboat</i> and go home.

01:49.526 --> 01:51.028
Anyone have

01:49.526 --> 01:51.028
a one-horse open sleigh?

01:52.446 --> 01:55.115
Come on, it's gonna

01:52.446 --> 01:55.115
be light soon.

01:55.156 --> 01:57.743
This is officially the worst

01:55.156 --> 01:57.743
Christmas vacation ever.

01:57.785 --> 01:59.661
And that includes

01:57.785 --> 01:59.661
the Chevy Chase movie.

02:01.705 --> 02:03.874
The protocol.

02:01.705 --> 02:03.874
They might have

02:01.705 --> 02:03.874
left us a message.

02:03.916 --> 02:05.417
-Buried--

02:03.916 --> 02:05.417
-Sure.

02:05.459 --> 02:07.878
We'll just go dig up a hole

02:05.459 --> 02:07.878
in the middle of North Korea.

02:07.920 --> 02:09.671
So, what,

02:07.920 --> 02:09.671
would you have us

02:07.920 --> 02:09.671
just do nothing?

02:09.713 --> 02:11.090
Just accept that

02:09.713 --> 02:11.090
they're all gone?

02:11.131 --> 02:12.716
I can't.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.716
I won't accept that.

02:12.758 --> 02:16.303
I'm not accepting anything.

02:12.758 --> 02:16.303
I'm saying we need

02:12.758 --> 02:16.303
a better plan.

02:16.344 --> 02:20.474
From what I found,

02:16.344 --> 02:20.474
it looks like they were in

02:16.344 --> 02:20.474
a helicopter crash on the 24th.

02:20.515 --> 02:23.351
-Yeah. Emma's doing.

02:20.515 --> 02:23.351
-They survived,

02:20.515 --> 02:23.351
the pilot didn't.

02:23.393 --> 02:27.064
Thanks to our intrepid team,

02:23.393 --> 02:27.064
no doubt. What exactly

02:23.393 --> 02:27.064
happens on the 25th?

02:27.106 --> 02:30.692
They are killed by

02:27.106 --> 02:30.692
Chinese troops in the

02:27.106 --> 02:30.692
massacre of Usang-Ri.

02:34.989 --> 02:36.615
We've gotta get to them

02:34.989 --> 02:36.615
before that happens.

02:36.657 --> 02:39.493
Uh, how? We don't have

02:36.657 --> 02:39.493
a time machine or a pilot.

02:40.494 --> 02:41.870
Rittenhouse has both.

02:41.912 --> 02:43.705
Yes, and I'm sure Emma

02:41.912 --> 02:43.705
would be delighted to help us

02:43.747 --> 02:45.332
if she wasn't the one

02:43.747 --> 02:45.332
trying to bloody kill us all.

02:46.917 --> 02:48.376
[Rufus] So, this is weird.

02:48.418 --> 02:50.462
In my timeline,

02:48.418 --> 02:50.462
you guys are still a couple.

02:50.504 --> 02:51.922
You think you'll get back

02:50.504 --> 02:51.922
together or what?

02:51.964 --> 02:54.633
Because I'm still totally

02:51.964 --> 02:54.633
shipping Team Lyatt.

02:54.675 --> 02:56.718
What? What's that?

02:56.760 --> 03:00.347
You guys are like Han and Leia.

02:56.760 --> 03:00.347
Uh, Arwen and Aragorn.

03:01.431 --> 03:02.724
Bella and Edward?

03:03.642 --> 03:04.893
You guys have obstacles, too.

03:06.145 --> 03:08.229
Rufus, it's not like

03:06.145 --> 03:08.229
we got into a fight.

03:08.271 --> 03:11.525
He was married, to someone else

03:08.271 --> 03:11.525
who he thought was dead.

03:11.566 --> 03:13.152
Who then, all of a sudden,

03:11.566 --> 03:13.152
wasn't dead.

03:13.192 --> 03:15.779
So he left me to be with her.

03:15.821 --> 03:17.614
And I know that you don't

03:15.821 --> 03:17.614
remember that,

03:17.656 --> 03:19.449
but it's not something

03:17.656 --> 03:19.449
I'm going to forget.

03:19.491 --> 03:20.784
Well, apparently

03:20.826 --> 03:22.410
I came back from the dead,

03:20.826 --> 03:22.410
so anything's possible.

03:22.452 --> 03:26.040
I hear that,

03:22.452 --> 03:26.040
but I don't want to be

03:22.452 --> 03:26.040
anyone's second choice.

03:26.081 --> 03:30.044
When you were kidnapped

03:26.081 --> 03:30.044
by your mother,

03:26.081 --> 03:30.044
we thought you were dead.

03:30.085 --> 03:32.713
We all lost hope.

03:30.085 --> 03:32.713
Except for Wyatt.

03:32.754 --> 03:35.382
He never gave up on you.

03:32.754 --> 03:35.382
He always swore

03:32.754 --> 03:35.382
you were out there.

03:35.423 --> 03:38.343
He tried to blowtorch his way

03:35.423 --> 03:38.343
out of the bunker to find you.

03:39.219 --> 03:41.055
I know there was a Jessica,

03:41.096 --> 03:42.723
but he was willing

03:41.096 --> 03:42.723
to give her up to find me.

03:42.764 --> 03:44.432
And I'll tell you,

03:42.764 --> 03:44.432
the guy likes me,

03:44.474 --> 03:48.311
but if he had to give you up,

03:44.474 --> 03:48.311
I know for a fact

03:44.474 --> 03:48.311
I'd still be dead.

03:48.353 --> 03:51.065
Doesn't sound

03:48.353 --> 03:51.065
like a second choice to me.

03:52.024 --> 03:53.316
Guys, look.

04:03.911 --> 04:04.995
[bellows]

04:05.037 --> 04:07.664
-Where are they going?

04:05.037 --> 04:07.664
-Hungnam.

04:07.706 --> 04:11.334
The last boats have to evacuate

04:07.706 --> 04:11.334
today before the Chinese army

04:07.706 --> 04:11.334
reaches the port.

04:11.376 --> 04:13.170
[Rufus] Or what happens?

04:13.212 --> 04:15.005
North Korea happens.

04:15.047 --> 04:17.007
Anyone who spoke out

04:15.047 --> 04:17.007
against communism or

04:15.047 --> 04:17.007
tried to help the Americans

04:17.049 --> 04:18.800
was, at best, imprisoned.

04:18.842 --> 04:21.428
-And at worst?

04:18.842 --> 04:21.428
-Beheaded.

04:21.469 --> 04:24.347
[Jiya] So, what about us?

04:21.469 --> 04:24.347
[Wyatt] We need to keep moving.

04:24.389 --> 04:27.768
Chinese just crossed the border

04:24.389 --> 04:27.768
and they march dark to dark.

04:27.809 --> 04:29.895
We gotta get to the<i> Lifeboat</i>

04:27.809 --> 04:29.895
before nightfall.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.772
Otherwise communists

04:29.937 --> 04:31.772
get our time machine,

04:31.813 --> 04:34.066
which, incidentally,

04:31.813 --> 04:34.066
is my least-favorite

04:31.813 --> 04:34.066
Christmas movie.

04:34.108 --> 04:35.817
[Wyatt] I'm not worried

04:34.108 --> 04:35.817
about the time machine.

04:35.859 --> 04:38.904
I'm worried about

04:35.859 --> 04:38.904
the thousands of Chinese

04:35.859 --> 04:38.904
troops between us and it.

04:38.946 --> 04:40.405
So, what are you saying?

04:40.447 --> 04:41.907
In all likelihood?

04:43.242 --> 04:44.409
We die.

04:54.335 --> 04:56.255
So, how long does

04:54.335 --> 04:56.255
this war go on for?

04:56.296 --> 05:00.092
War lasts another three years,

04:56.296 --> 05:00.092
till the armistice.

05:00.134 --> 05:02.970
But nobody wins.

05:00.134 --> 05:02.970
North Korea shuts its doors.

05:03.011 --> 05:05.931
There are families who haven't

05:03.011 --> 05:05.931
seen or heard from each other

05:03.011 --> 05:05.931
in decades.

05:05.973 --> 05:07.266
Hey, let's check out that car.

05:07.307 --> 05:09.309
Please, please,

05:07.307 --> 05:09.309
be a car with a heater.

05:13.438 --> 05:14.940
[ignition whirring]

05:14.982 --> 05:16.399
Dead car.

05:16.441 --> 05:18.735
Well, not exactly sure

05:16.441 --> 05:18.735
dead is a forever thing

05:16.441 --> 05:18.735
with us.

05:18.777 --> 05:20.654
Hey, with our

05:18.777 --> 05:20.654
combined skill set,

05:20.695 --> 05:23.323
how long you think it takes

05:20.695 --> 05:23.323
before this is up and running?

05:23.364 --> 05:26.785
-Rufus, I...

05:23.364 --> 05:26.785
-Look, it'll be safer, faster

05:23.364 --> 05:26.785
and warmer with wheels.

05:26.827 --> 05:29.329
All right. Why don't you and

05:26.827 --> 05:29.329
Jiya go get warm in the church?

05:29.370 --> 05:31.248
'Cause we're women

05:29.370 --> 05:31.248
and it's 1950?

05:31.290 --> 05:32.582
Because you're

05:31.290 --> 05:32.582
starting to get frostbite.

05:32.624 --> 05:33.875
You look much

05:32.624 --> 05:33.875
prettier with ears.

05:33.917 --> 05:35.961
Good point. Let's go.

05:37.378 --> 05:38.672
[both shivering]

05:46.387 --> 05:47.722
Sit there.

05:54.021 --> 05:55.147
[Lucy exhales]

05:57.440 --> 05:59.693
In San Francisco, in 1888,

05:59.734 --> 06:05.115
there was this beautiful

05:59.734 --> 06:05.115
cathedral, St. Mary's.

06:05.157 --> 06:10.245
Rufus will probably think

06:05.157 --> 06:10.245
I was crazy, but it made

06:05.157 --> 06:10.245
me feel closer to him.

06:10.287 --> 06:13.790
I'm really happy for you,

06:10.287 --> 06:13.790
for both of you. I mean,

06:10.287 --> 06:13.790
just to have him back.

06:13.832 --> 06:16.210
-I love him.

06:13.832 --> 06:16.210
-I know you do.

06:16.251 --> 06:17.961
So much, Lucy.

06:18.003 --> 06:19.629
He loves you, too.

06:19.671 --> 06:21.840
He thinks he does.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.134
But he has no idea

06:21.882 --> 06:24.134
who I am now.

06:24.176 --> 06:27.262
What he remembers as yesterday

06:24.176 --> 06:27.262
was three years ago for me.

06:27.304 --> 06:28.513
And I've changed, Lucy.

06:28.555 --> 06:31.183
I'm not the same person

06:28.555 --> 06:31.183
he fell in love with.

06:33.977 --> 06:35.187
I'm scared I never will be.

06:37.522 --> 06:38.815
Shh!

06:38.857 --> 06:42.236
You need to be careful.

06:38.857 --> 06:42.236
Informants are everywhere.

06:46.240 --> 06:47.241
[Jiya] Sorry.

06:47.949 --> 06:49.784
What are you doing here?

06:49.826 --> 06:52.620
I thought there were

06:49.826 --> 06:52.620
no Americans

06:49.826 --> 06:52.620
left in the north.

06:54.248 --> 06:58.417
We're war correspondents.

06:54.248 --> 06:58.417
We got separated from our unit.

06:58.459 --> 07:00.670
I'm Rachel Maddow and this...

07:03.048 --> 07:04.132
I'm Lucy. This is Jiya.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.688
[door closes]

07:18.730 --> 07:21.316
-I'm Young-Hee.

07:18.730 --> 07:21.316
-Hi.

07:21.358 --> 07:24.236
-Your English is very good.

07:21.358 --> 07:24.236
-I went to a missionary school.

07:24.278 --> 07:25.486
Oh.

07:25.528 --> 07:27.739
-Are you evacuating?

07:25.528 --> 07:27.739
-No.

07:27.781 --> 07:29.199
I came here to pray.

07:33.203 --> 07:35.705
My husband,

07:33.203 --> 07:35.705
he's a journalist, too,

07:35.747 --> 07:36.957
but he asked

07:35.747 --> 07:36.957
too many questions.

07:36.998 --> 07:38.875
They ordered him to print lies.

07:38.917 --> 07:41.878
-We heard they

07:38.917 --> 07:41.878
were coming for him.

07:38.917 --> 07:41.878
-Did he go to Hungnam?

07:43.797 --> 07:45.882
With my son, Tae-Woo.

07:45.924 --> 07:48.718
I pray they are safe

07:45.924 --> 07:48.718
on the boat.

07:48.760 --> 07:53.056
What about you?

07:48.760 --> 07:53.056
What are you going to do?

07:53.098 --> 07:55.350
Wait until our army

07:53.098 --> 07:55.350
pushes the Chinese back.

07:55.392 --> 07:57.894
In a few days,

07:55.392 --> 07:57.894
maybe this will all be over.

07:57.936 --> 08:00.439
Then my husband and son

07:57.936 --> 08:00.439
will come home.

08:10.198 --> 08:13.618
I still can't believe Jessica

08:10.198 --> 08:13.618
was alive, or that I was dead.

08:13.660 --> 08:16.704
My memories are completely

08:13.660 --> 08:16.704
different from yours

08:13.660 --> 08:16.704
after Hollywood.

08:16.746 --> 08:17.998
You know what's crazy?

08:18.039 --> 08:20.208
Yesterday, Jiya was

08:18.039 --> 08:20.208
a year younger than me.

08:20.250 --> 08:23.337
Now, she's two years older.

08:20.250 --> 08:23.337
She looks pretty good

08:20.250 --> 08:23.337
for her age.

08:23.378 --> 08:25.172
Plus, I always had a thing

08:23.378 --> 08:25.172
for older women.

08:25.213 --> 08:26.381
Started in middle

08:25.213 --> 08:26.381
school actually--

08:26.423 --> 08:29.092
Rufus, I gotta

08:26.423 --> 08:29.092
tell you something.

08:29.134 --> 08:31.594
Jiya being stuck in Chinatown

08:29.134 --> 08:31.594
for three years...

08:32.887 --> 08:34.722
That was all my fault.

08:34.764 --> 08:36.224
Jiya said

08:34.764 --> 08:36.224
it was Jessica's fault--

08:36.266 --> 08:39.686
Yeah, but it was my fault

08:36.266 --> 08:39.686
for trusting Jessica.

08:39.727 --> 08:44.232
Even when I knew things

08:39.727 --> 08:44.232
didn't add up.

08:39.727 --> 08:44.232
You even said so yourself.

08:44.274 --> 08:48.278
And you told me that

08:44.274 --> 08:48.278
you would never forgive me

08:44.274 --> 08:48.278
for what happened to her.

08:51.406 --> 08:53.158
Why are you telling me this?

08:55.410 --> 08:57.537
Because I'd be lying

08:55.410 --> 08:57.537
to you if I didn't.

09:05.420 --> 09:08.215
-[ignition whirring,

09:05.420 --> 09:08.215
engine turns over]

09:05.420 --> 09:08.215
-[Rufus laughing]

09:12.135 --> 09:13.387
Hey, Wyatt.

09:14.513 --> 09:15.805
I forgive you.

09:24.272 --> 09:25.190
[Wyatt] That's not good.

09:25.232 --> 09:26.316
Come on.

09:28.609 --> 09:29.528
Guys...

09:30.778 --> 09:32.072
We gotta go.

09:32.113 --> 09:33.532
Couple of North Korean soldiers

09:32.113 --> 09:33.532
headed our way.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.158
I'm pretty sure

09:33.573 --> 09:35.158
they're not here

09:33.573 --> 09:35.158
for midnight mass.

09:35.200 --> 09:38.828
Wait, wait, wait!

09:35.200 --> 09:38.828
We have to take her with us.

09:38.870 --> 09:41.873
-Is she important to history?

09:38.870 --> 09:41.873
-Everybody is important.

09:41.915 --> 09:43.417
Lucy, what do you

09:41.915 --> 09:43.417
want me to do?

09:43.458 --> 09:44.625
We have to take her to Hungnam.

09:44.667 --> 09:46.294
She is super pregnant

09:46.336 --> 09:48.422
and she put her life

09:46.336 --> 09:48.422
on the line for us,

09:46.336 --> 09:48.422
no questions asked.

09:48.463 --> 09:50.215
The<i> Lifeboat</i>

09:48.463 --> 09:50.215
is ten miles north.

09:50.257 --> 09:53.718
The port is eight miles south.

09:50.257 --> 09:53.718
We can't lose that much time.

09:53.760 --> 09:55.429
She thinks that her husband

09:53.760 --> 09:55.429
and son are coming home.

09:55.470 --> 09:57.347
Quick history in CliffsNotes,

09:55.470 --> 09:57.347
nobody comes home.

09:57.389 --> 10:00.225
Even if they survive,

09:57.389 --> 10:00.225
she'll be separated

09:57.389 --> 10:00.225
from her family forever.

10:00.267 --> 10:02.894
I'm telling you, we're not

10:00.267 --> 10:02.894
gonna make it to the<i> Lifeboat</i>

10:00.267 --> 10:02.894
if we go to Hungnam.

10:02.936 --> 10:04.979
I wouldn't be here

10:02.936 --> 10:04.979
if my parents didn't

10:02.936 --> 10:04.979
get out of Lebanon.

10:05.021 --> 10:08.442
I got a second chance.

10:05.021 --> 10:08.442
Why shouldn't they?

10:08.483 --> 10:11.152
What's the point of saving

10:08.483 --> 10:11.152
history if we don't save

10:08.483 --> 10:11.152
the people in it?

10:11.194 --> 10:12.404
[man shouting in Korean]

10:18.910 --> 10:20.287
[people panicking]

10:21.580 --> 10:22.830
[speaking Korean]

10:25.125 --> 10:26.460
[all panting]

10:31.672 --> 10:32.924
[truck driving away]

10:43.393 --> 10:45.604
I think we lost them.

10:43.393 --> 10:45.604
Is everybody all right?

10:45.645 --> 10:47.688
-Yeah.

10:47.730 --> 10:51.109
[Wyatt] We'll be lucky if

10:47.730 --> 10:51.109
we make it through town,

10:47.730 --> 10:51.109
much less to the port.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.735
I can't go to the port.

10:52.777 --> 10:55.863
I need to stay and wait

10:52.777 --> 10:55.863
for my husband and son

10:52.777 --> 10:55.863
to come home.

10:55.905 --> 10:57.698
Young-Hee,

10:55.905 --> 10:57.698
those men will find you.

10:57.740 --> 10:59.284
It's not safe for you

10:57.740 --> 10:59.284
to stay here anymore.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.077
If you get on a boat, then you

10:59.326 --> 11:01.077
can catch up with your family.

11:01.119 --> 11:02.662
You'll be together.

11:02.703 --> 11:05.499
-It's only a few days.

11:02.703 --> 11:05.499
-What if it's not?

11:11.004 --> 11:12.213
-What's that?

11:11.004 --> 11:12.213
-Huh?

11:13.672 --> 11:17.344
Oh, St. Christopher,

11:13.672 --> 11:17.344
patron saint of travelers.

11:17.385 --> 11:21.055
Found it at the church.

11:17.385 --> 11:21.055
Thought we could use

11:17.385 --> 11:21.055
a little extra luck.

11:21.097 --> 11:23.724
After everything

11:21.097 --> 11:23.724
you've been through,

11:21.097 --> 11:23.724
you still kept your faith.

11:23.766 --> 11:26.353
Rufus, you came back to me.

11:23.766 --> 11:26.353
How could I not?

11:28.062 --> 11:30.148
Merry Christmas to me.

11:31.525 --> 11:32.651
[sighs]

11:37.738 --> 11:38.739
Michael.

11:40.033 --> 11:41.451
-[footsteps]

11:40.033 --> 11:41.451
-There you are.

11:43.036 --> 11:44.204
I was wondering...

11:49.876 --> 11:51.961
Mr. Cahill.

11:52.003 --> 11:54.713
[stammers] I didn't know

11:52.003 --> 11:54.713
you'd been released

11:52.003 --> 11:54.713
from prison.

11:54.755 --> 11:56.841
Rittenhouse always

11:54.755 --> 11:56.841
finds a way, Emma.

11:58.051 --> 11:59.553
How did you find us?

11:59.594 --> 12:02.681
I know every Rittenhouse-owned

11:59.594 --> 12:02.681
property on the West Coast.

12:02.721 --> 12:04.224
Started with the estates

12:04.265 --> 12:07.143
and took some time to work

12:04.265 --> 12:07.143
my way down to this dump.

12:07.185 --> 12:10.980
We've had some difficult times

12:07.185 --> 12:10.980
in your absence.

12:11.022 --> 12:15.443
The most powerful

12:11.022 --> 12:15.443
secret society

12:11.022 --> 12:15.443
the world has ever seen,

12:15.485 --> 12:16.986
a family treasure,

12:18.405 --> 12:19.906
reduced to this.

12:19.947 --> 12:24.118
That incredible machine used

12:19.947 --> 12:24.118
so that you could, what?

12:25.328 --> 12:26.580
Collect art?

12:26.621 --> 12:29.207
I'm trying to replenish

12:26.621 --> 12:29.207
Rittenhouse's assets--

12:29.249 --> 12:33.670
Save it.

12:29.249 --> 12:33.670
You're greedy and selfish.

12:33.712 --> 12:35.046
I've been called worse.

12:36.464 --> 12:37.924
I came to say goodbye.

12:41.553 --> 12:43.846
Just give me a reason, Emma.

12:43.888 --> 12:45.557
Thank you for your help,

12:43.888 --> 12:45.557
Mr. Cahill.

12:45.599 --> 12:47.225
Couldn't have found

12:45.599 --> 12:47.225
this place without you.

12:47.267 --> 12:48.435
You sold us out?

12:48.476 --> 12:49.644
I'm selfish, too.

12:49.686 --> 12:51.229
What did she promise you?

12:51.271 --> 12:53.898
The chance to save

12:51.271 --> 12:53.898
my daughter's life.

12:53.940 --> 12:55.358
Lucy still means

12:53.940 --> 12:55.358
something to me.

12:55.400 --> 12:57.652
Plus protection and immunity

12:55.400 --> 12:57.652
for my teenage son.

12:57.694 --> 12:59.904
It's a family thing, Emma.

13:02.240 --> 13:05.326
Something you'll never

13:02.240 --> 13:05.326
have or understand.

13:10.457 --> 13:11.499
[Lucy] How old is your son?

13:12.333 --> 13:13.543
He's eight.

13:13.585 --> 13:16.379
-Does he like school?

13:13.585 --> 13:16.379
-Not as much as I do.

13:16.421 --> 13:17.756
I'm a teacher.

13:17.796 --> 13:20.883
-What do you teach?

13:17.796 --> 13:20.883
-History.

13:20.925 --> 13:25.305
It's hard now. The party wants

13:20.925 --> 13:25.305
us to only teach propaganda.

13:25.346 --> 13:29.100
"And the people without

13:25.346 --> 13:29.100
knowledge of their past

13:25.346 --> 13:29.100
history, origin and culture--"

13:29.142 --> 13:32.186
Is like a tree without roots."

13:29.142 --> 13:32.186
Marcus Garvey.

13:32.228 --> 13:33.938
I used to be

13:32.228 --> 13:33.938
a history teacher, too.

13:35.273 --> 13:36.316
[Young-Hee groans]

13:38.777 --> 13:42.071
-You all right?

13:38.777 --> 13:42.071
-It happened earlier.

13:42.113 --> 13:43.490
-I'm fine.

13:42.113 --> 13:43.490
-[Lucy] Okay.

13:43.531 --> 13:44.574
[engine sputtering]

13:48.787 --> 13:50.789
-Come on!

13:48.787 --> 13:50.789
-Want to pop the hood again?

13:50.829 --> 13:52.290
[Wyatt] We're only about

13:50.829 --> 13:52.290
a mile from port.

13:52.332 --> 13:54.000
I think we just need to walk it

13:52.332 --> 13:54.000
the rest of the way.

13:54.041 --> 13:55.627
Walk? In her condition?

13:56.586 --> 13:57.920
Okay, okay.

14:01.549 --> 14:02.550
Here.

14:03.677 --> 14:05.219
It's not too much farther.

14:09.432 --> 14:10.725
[moans]

14:10.767 --> 14:12.352
[Wyatt] Oh.

14:10.767 --> 14:12.352
[Lucy] Oh, God!

14:12.393 --> 14:14.354
You're not okay.

14:12.393 --> 14:14.354
Young-Hee, you're in labor!

14:14.395 --> 14:16.439
-[Jiya] Should we get

14:14.395 --> 14:16.439
her to the ambulance?

14:14.395 --> 14:16.439
-No, it's too late.

14:16.481 --> 14:17.482
Over here. Come on.

14:18.274 --> 14:20.067
[Lucy] Okay. Oh, my God.

14:20.109 --> 14:22.445
[Wyatt] Set her right here.

14:20.109 --> 14:22.445
Right here.

14:20.109 --> 14:22.445
[Lucy] Oh, my God.

14:22.487 --> 14:25.239
-We got you, we got you.

14:22.487 --> 14:25.239
-Okay. Oh, God,

14:22.487 --> 14:25.239
oh, God, oh, God.

14:25.281 --> 14:26.783
All right, just breathe.

14:26.825 --> 14:27.784
[breathing deeply]

14:27.826 --> 14:29.869
-Good job.

14:27.826 --> 14:29.869
-You've done this before?

14:29.910 --> 14:33.748
Remote village in Afghanistan.

14:29.910 --> 14:33.748
Woman was in labor

14:29.910 --> 14:33.748
for over 22 hours.

14:33.790 --> 14:35.458
Tried to get her to a hospital

14:33.790 --> 14:35.458
but it was too late.

14:35.500 --> 14:36.876
Healthy baby girl.

14:36.917 --> 14:38.169
[Rufus] So you know

14:36.917 --> 14:38.169
what you're doing.

14:38.211 --> 14:40.839
Well, nothing went

14:38.211 --> 14:40.839
wrong that time.

14:40.880 --> 14:43.466
Okay, well, there's...

14:40.880 --> 14:43.466
There's a MASH

14:40.880 --> 14:43.466
facility at the port.

14:43.508 --> 14:44.801
I can go find a doctor.

14:45.968 --> 14:47.053
Fine. Take Rufus with you.

14:47.094 --> 14:48.680
-Okay.

14:47.094 --> 14:48.680
-Be careful, all right?

14:48.722 --> 14:50.431
They're shelling the perimeter

14:48.722 --> 14:50.431
to keep the Chinese out.

14:50.473 --> 14:52.600
-Come on, let's go.

14:50.473 --> 14:52.600
-You got this, Young-Hee.

14:55.436 --> 14:56.604
[Lucy shivering]

14:57.814 --> 14:59.399
God, it's cold.

15:00.567 --> 15:02.026
[explosions]

15:06.489 --> 15:08.533
In just a few hours

15:06.489 --> 15:08.533
they bomb this whole place?

15:08.575 --> 15:10.493
Can't leave any supplies behind

15:08.575 --> 15:10.493
for the enemy.

15:10.535 --> 15:12.078
But everyone makes

15:10.535 --> 15:12.078
it out alive, right?

15:13.538 --> 15:14.706
Thanks to those two.

15:14.748 --> 15:16.457
It's Colonel Forney

15:14.748 --> 15:16.457
and Dr. Hyun Bong-hak.

15:16.499 --> 15:18.459
They're the real heroes

15:16.499 --> 15:18.459
behind this entire operation.

15:18.501 --> 15:20.211
Convinced General Almond not

15:18.501 --> 15:20.211
to leave any refugees behind.

15:20.253 --> 15:21.838
Colonel Forney, sir.

15:21.880 --> 15:24.131
-Ma'am, why haven't

15:21.880 --> 15:24.131
you evacuated?

15:21.880 --> 15:24.131
-I'm a war correspondent.

15:24.173 --> 15:25.925
Lucy Preston.

15:24.173 --> 15:25.925
I work with Maggie Higgins.

15:25.966 --> 15:28.052
We put Maggie

15:25.966 --> 15:28.052
on a plane days ago.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.387
I know. We got separated.

15:29.429 --> 15:30.805
We need to get you on a boat.

15:30.847 --> 15:32.724
Of course, of course.

15:30.847 --> 15:32.724
But, uh, Private Carlin here,

15:32.766 --> 15:34.726
he came across a refugee

15:32.766 --> 15:34.726
who's gone into labor.

15:34.768 --> 15:37.353
We need a nurse or a doctor

15:34.768 --> 15:37.353
as soon as possible.

15:37.395 --> 15:39.355
MASH unit's jammed up

15:37.395 --> 15:39.355
with injured patients.

15:39.397 --> 15:41.232
-We need everyone we got--

15:39.397 --> 15:41.232
-Sir, please!

15:41.274 --> 15:44.402
Ma'am, I got to make sure

15:41.274 --> 15:44.402
every one in this port

15:41.274 --> 15:44.402
gets out safely, okay?

15:44.444 --> 15:46.237
Maybe you can find a midwife.

15:47.488 --> 15:50.032
-I'll take care of this,

15:47.488 --> 15:50.032
Colonel.

15:47.488 --> 15:50.032
-Really?

15:50.074 --> 15:53.244
-Last boat departs

15:50.074 --> 15:53.244
at 1400 hours.

15:50.074 --> 15:53.244
-Okay, let's go.

15:54.495 --> 15:55.705
Come on, come on!

15:55.747 --> 15:57.373
[screaming]

15:57.415 --> 15:59.250
Jiya,

15:57.415 --> 15:59.250
run back to the ambulance,

15:57.415 --> 15:59.250
see if you can find supplies.

15:59.292 --> 16:00.877
Emergency blankets, towels,

15:59.292 --> 16:00.877
first-aid kit, anything.

16:00.919 --> 16:02.962
-Okay, but the doctor is--

16:00.919 --> 16:02.962
-No time to wait for a doctor.

16:03.003 --> 16:04.297
This baby's coming now. Go.

16:10.261 --> 16:11.638
Around that corner!

16:11.679 --> 16:13.097
Up that hill about a mile away!

16:13.890 --> 16:16.058
[explosions continue]

16:16.100 --> 16:17.811
-[loud explosion]

16:16.100 --> 16:17.811
-Oh! Oh, my God!

16:21.105 --> 16:22.649
-Wyatt!

16:21.105 --> 16:22.649
-Jiya!

16:27.528 --> 16:30.698
Wyatt! Wyatt!

16:27.528 --> 16:30.698
[sobbing]

16:30.740 --> 16:32.575
-Oh, my God!

16:30.740 --> 16:32.575
-[Dr. Hyun] Artillery fire.

16:32.617 --> 16:34.494
No. Oh, my God.

16:35.495 --> 16:36.704
Wyatt!

16:36.746 --> 16:38.456
[crying] Oh, my God.

16:39.958 --> 16:40.917
[Wyatt] That was close, huh?

16:47.548 --> 16:48.675
It's a girl.

16:50.760 --> 16:52.011
[laughing]

16:58.142 --> 16:59.853
[Rufus] Jiya, Jiya.

16:59.894 --> 17:01.020
[baby cooing]

17:02.856 --> 17:03.898
Oh, my gosh.

17:05.859 --> 17:07.234
[chuckles]

17:07.276 --> 17:08.611
[Rufus] Wyatt delivered a baby?

17:08.653 --> 17:09.946
[Jiya] In the middle

17:08.653 --> 17:09.946
of a war zone.

17:09.988 --> 17:11.572
All right, wasn't a big deal.

17:11.614 --> 17:14.659
What else don't

17:11.614 --> 17:14.659
I know about you?

17:14.701 --> 17:18.037
-Guys, we need to

17:14.701 --> 17:18.037
get to the<i> Lifeboat.</i>

17:14.701 --> 17:18.037
-I'll try and find us a truck.

17:18.078 --> 17:20.080
We will make you

17:18.078 --> 17:20.080
as comfortable as possible,

17:20.122 --> 17:21.708
but we have to get

17:20.122 --> 17:21.708
you on a boat soon.

17:21.749 --> 17:24.126
But how will I find

17:21.749 --> 17:24.126
my husband and my son?

17:24.168 --> 17:26.045
There was no time

17:24.168 --> 17:26.045
for record keeping.

17:26.086 --> 17:28.088
-You will see him

17:26.086 --> 17:28.088
in Pusan, I think.

17:26.086 --> 17:28.088
-[Young-Hee] No.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.966
-No, no, no, Young-Hee,

17:28.130 --> 17:29.966
Young-Hee.

17:28.130 --> 17:29.966
-Wait, wait, wait.

17:30.008 --> 17:31.592
-Listen to me.

17:30.008 --> 17:31.592
<i>-Umma!</i>

17:32.927 --> 17:34.261
Tae-Woo!

17:34.303 --> 17:35.555
[all exclaiming]

17:39.433 --> 17:40.935
[Young-Hee speaking Korean]

17:40.977 --> 17:43.062
[Yang-Won speaking Korean]

17:43.103 --> 17:44.856
-[baby crying]

17:43.103 --> 17:44.856
-[shushing]

17:47.734 --> 17:49.485
[Wyatt] I think

17:47.734 --> 17:49.485
this little treasure

17:47.734 --> 17:49.485
belongs to you.

17:54.281 --> 17:57.035
[Dr. Hyun] The boats

17:54.281 --> 17:57.035
are leaving soon.

17:54.281 --> 17:57.035
[Young-Hee] Thank you.

17:57.076 --> 17:58.077
For everything.

17:58.118 --> 17:59.495
Of course, of course.

17:59.537 --> 18:00.914
Good luck. Good luck.

18:01.497 --> 18:02.582
Okay. [chuckles]

18:09.088 --> 18:11.215
Guys, problem.

18:09.088 --> 18:11.215
We can't get a truck.

18:11.257 --> 18:12.592
Rufus, there's like

18:11.257 --> 18:12.592
a million of them here.

18:12.633 --> 18:14.176
They're all rigged

18:12.633 --> 18:14.176
with explosives.

18:14.218 --> 18:16.178
They're gonna blow up

18:14.218 --> 18:16.178
the minute the last boat

18:14.218 --> 18:16.178
leaves port.

18:16.220 --> 18:18.138
Anything with four wheels

18:16.220 --> 18:18.138
is a bomb.

18:23.728 --> 18:25.271
You okay?

18:25.312 --> 18:27.231
I'm trying to have

18:25.312 --> 18:27.231
a vision of a hot shower.

18:25.312 --> 18:27.231
Leave me alone.

18:27.273 --> 18:28.524
Cool, cool, cool.

18:28.566 --> 18:30.568
What are the signs

18:28.566 --> 18:30.568
of frostbite again?

18:39.827 --> 18:41.370
-Who kills a nun?

18:39.827 --> 18:41.370
-Shh...

18:41.412 --> 18:42.538
[explosions]

18:43.539 --> 18:44.624
[indistinct shouting]

18:44.665 --> 18:45.666
Communists.

18:47.043 --> 18:48.002
We're surrounded.

18:49.670 --> 18:51.130
We can't outrun them,

18:49.670 --> 18:51.130
we can't fight them.

18:51.171 --> 18:52.632
We need to hide. Come on.

19:03.059 --> 19:04.727
Stop. They'll see us.

19:04.769 --> 19:06.479
What if they find us anyway?

19:06.520 --> 19:09.023
Well, I'll fire

19:06.520 --> 19:09.023
as many rounds

19:06.520 --> 19:09.023
as I have left.

19:09.065 --> 19:10.149
And then?

19:10.817 --> 19:11.943
Good talk.

19:11.985 --> 19:14.821
I just really don't

19:11.985 --> 19:14.821
want to die. Again.

19:14.862 --> 19:16.864
Would you stop it?

19:14.862 --> 19:16.864
We're not gonna die, okay?

19:16.906 --> 19:18.616
Not after everything

19:16.906 --> 19:18.616
we've been through.

19:19.993 --> 19:21.368
Honestly, I hope you're right.

19:21.410 --> 19:24.872
I hope there is a God

19:21.410 --> 19:24.872
and that he, or she, saves us.

19:26.457 --> 19:29.043
You'd think he/she would save

19:26.457 --> 19:29.043
the nun, though, right?

19:31.004 --> 19:32.088
Just saying.

19:33.798 --> 19:34.757
[chuckles softly]

19:35.716 --> 19:37.135
See?

19:37.176 --> 19:38.511
You still laugh at my jokes.

19:43.016 --> 19:45.935
I'm glad we're together.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.818
Look, Jiya, I know

19:51.524 --> 19:53.818
things are different for you.

19:53.860 --> 19:55.111
But...

19:56.946 --> 19:58.238
We're still us.

19:59.907 --> 20:01.784
And for me,

20:01.826 --> 20:05.621
there's no one else

20:01.826 --> 20:05.621
I'd rather face a bloodthirsty

20:01.826 --> 20:05.621
army of communists with.

20:07.498 --> 20:08.666
Me, too.

20:25.099 --> 20:26.350
What are you thinking about?

20:32.857 --> 20:33.900
Flynn.

20:36.152 --> 20:40.740
The last thing that he said

20:36.152 --> 20:40.740
to us before he left

20:36.152 --> 20:40.740
to get in the<i> Lifeboat</i>

20:40.781 --> 20:45.078
was if we all run off

20:40.781 --> 20:45.078
to save Rufus,

20:40.781 --> 20:45.078
who will save the world?

20:45.119 --> 20:47.287
-If we die tonight...

20:45.119 --> 20:47.287
-I'm not giving up yet.

20:52.334 --> 20:53.920
I guess it's all up to fate.

20:57.297 --> 20:58.549
What?

21:00.342 --> 21:01.552
Just you...

21:03.804 --> 21:05.181
talking about fate.

21:09.143 --> 21:11.353
So, you were right.

21:11.395 --> 21:13.940
And here you had me convinced

21:11.395 --> 21:13.940
that there was no such thing.

21:15.649 --> 21:17.110
Timing is everything, right?

21:24.200 --> 21:25.367
[scoffs]

21:28.662 --> 21:30.539
After that explosion,

21:28.662 --> 21:30.539
I thought you were dead.

21:32.166 --> 21:37.296
And for a moment,

21:32.166 --> 21:37.296
I saw my whole life

21:32.166 --> 21:37.296
without you.

21:38.256 --> 21:40.466
And my world ended, Wyatt.

21:41.217 --> 21:43.552
I just kept thinking about

21:43.594 --> 21:46.180
all this time

21:43.594 --> 21:46.180
that we had wasted.

21:46.222 --> 21:48.390
Just wasted so much time,

21:48.432 --> 21:51.144
and then, all of a sudden,

21:48.432 --> 21:51.144
there you were.

21:51.185 --> 21:53.854
Holding a stranger's baby

21:51.185 --> 21:53.854
that you had delivered.

21:55.522 --> 21:57.733
-Then I knew.

21:55.522 --> 21:57.733
-You knew what?

21:59.235 --> 22:01.487
I'd fallen in love with you.

22:01.528 --> 22:03.906
And nothing that happened

22:01.528 --> 22:03.906
or didn't happen

22:03.948 --> 22:05.950
or might happen

22:03.948 --> 22:05.950
was ever gonna change it.

22:17.295 --> 22:19.546
I love you, Wyatt Logan.

22:19.588 --> 22:21.465
I've loved you since the Alamo,

22:21.507 --> 22:24.760
since you kissed me

22:21.507 --> 22:24.760
with Bonnie and Clyde,

22:24.802 --> 22:26.679
since that night in Hollywood.

22:27.638 --> 22:29.182
What happened after...

22:31.058 --> 22:33.102
I wanted to choose you.

22:33.144 --> 22:35.021
I just felt like

22:33.144 --> 22:35.021
I owed her something.

22:35.479 --> 22:37.148
[sniffles]

22:37.190 --> 22:38.565
I wish I could

22:37.190 --> 22:38.565
take it all back.

22:40.234 --> 22:42.736
And the crazy part is,

22:40.234 --> 22:42.736
Flynn already did.

22:42.778 --> 22:47.616
And now, all that we have

22:42.778 --> 22:47.616
between us is a past

22:42.778 --> 22:47.616
that only we remember.

22:53.706 --> 22:54.957
So?

22:56.959 --> 22:59.377
I don't care

22:56.959 --> 22:59.377
about the past anymore.

22:59.419 --> 23:01.005
And we might not have a future.

23:02.464 --> 23:04.258
Maybe all that matters

23:02.464 --> 23:04.258
is right now.

23:16.145 --> 23:18.731
[bell tolling]

23:21.525 --> 23:23.777
[explosions outside

23:21.525 --> 23:23.777
intensifies]

23:28.741 --> 23:30.034
[crackling]

23:47.093 --> 23:49.595
Oh, my God!

23:47.093 --> 23:49.595
I can't believe

23:47.093 --> 23:49.595
you're here.

23:49.636 --> 23:51.138
[both laughing]

23:52.723 --> 23:54.474
[Denise sighs]

23:54.516 --> 23:56.727
[Denise] I didn't want

23:54.516 --> 23:56.727
to have to leave you here

23:54.516 --> 23:56.727
to die on Christmas.

23:56.769 --> 23:59.063
Plus, I wanted

23:56.769 --> 23:59.063
to time travel

23:56.769 --> 23:59.063
at least once.

24:00.647 --> 24:01.857
What, no hug?

24:02.524 --> 24:03.650
What would Jesus do?

24:03.692 --> 24:05.319
And you brought Scrooge.

24:05.361 --> 24:07.696
Was it the Ghost

24:05.361 --> 24:07.696
of Christmas Past or Future

24:05.361 --> 24:07.696
that got her here?

24:07.738 --> 24:09.240
I think I liked you better

24:07.738 --> 24:09.240
when you were dead.

24:09.282 --> 24:10.448
Sorry it didn't take.

24:10.490 --> 24:11.992
How'd you like time traveling?

24:12.034 --> 24:15.829
Not my choice of destinations,

24:12.034 --> 24:15.829
but still quite the miracle.

24:15.871 --> 24:17.539
[chuckles]

24:17.581 --> 24:18.707
[Jiya] Guys, it's just...

24:19.833 --> 24:21.085
Saint Christopher!

24:23.129 --> 24:24.880
Agent Christopher?

24:25.923 --> 24:26.799
Oh, come on.

24:29.509 --> 24:31.511
-Hey!

24:29.509 --> 24:31.511
-Wait, wait!

24:33.139 --> 24:34.514
I can bring Amy back.

24:37.059 --> 24:38.144
She's lying.

24:38.936 --> 24:39.895
[Emma] Try me.

24:49.322 --> 24:51.449
I only did it

24:49.322 --> 24:51.449
'cause your mother

24:49.322 --> 24:51.449
ordered me to.

24:52.450 --> 24:53.700
But I can undo it.

24:53.742 --> 24:55.828
It means nothing to me

24:53.742 --> 24:55.828
and everything to you.

24:58.080 --> 24:59.248
The truth is...

25:01.041 --> 25:03.127
I admire you, Lucy.

25:03.169 --> 25:06.172
We would make

25:03.169 --> 25:06.172
one hell of a team.

25:06.213 --> 25:09.842
Screw the Rittenhouse agenda.

25:06.213 --> 25:09.842
We could make history

25:06.213 --> 25:09.842
whatever we want.

25:15.639 --> 25:17.141
I want all of this to be over.

25:17.183 --> 25:19.517
And you want your sister back.

25:22.480 --> 25:23.856
I can make that happen.

25:25.065 --> 25:26.442
You just have to trust me.

25:36.702 --> 25:37.953
I don't.

25:40.247 --> 25:42.582
If she gets any closer

25:40.247 --> 25:42.582
to that ship, shoot her.

25:42.624 --> 25:43.501
[gunshot]

25:44.335 --> 25:45.503
[Rufus] Oh! Oh!

25:46.795 --> 25:48.214
Everybody,

25:46.795 --> 25:48.214
get to the<i> Mothership!</i>

25:51.800 --> 25:52.843
[Rufus] Get in, get in!

25:51.800 --> 25:52.843
[Jiya] Come on!

25:53.635 --> 25:54.720
[gunfire]

26:06.648 --> 26:08.775
Rufus is gonna get

26:06.648 --> 26:08.775
the<i> Mothership</i> home, right?

26:08.817 --> 26:11.111
Well, Rufus got us

26:08.817 --> 26:11.111
to the<i> Lifeboat,</i> didn't he?

26:13.906 --> 26:15.782
Maybe our future selves

26:13.906 --> 26:15.782
came back to save Rufus

26:15.824 --> 26:17.159
so that he could save us all.

26:17.201 --> 26:18.827
Yeah, or maybe...

26:18.869 --> 26:19.953
Maybe what?

26:21.455 --> 26:23.249
[sighs]

26:23.290 --> 26:25.418
Maybe they wanted things

26:23.290 --> 26:25.418
to turn out differently

26:23.290 --> 26:25.418
for us than it did them.

26:27.711 --> 26:28.795
[Lucy laughs]

26:31.257 --> 26:34.093
You know what,

26:31.257 --> 26:34.093
I think I can handle

26:31.257 --> 26:34.093
this by now.

26:34.134 --> 26:36.011
Well, it's no problem at all,

26:36.470 --> 26:37.971
ma'am.

26:38.013 --> 26:39.515
Don't you call me ma'am.

26:41.141 --> 26:42.226
[Wyatt sighs]

26:42.268 --> 26:43.269
What?

26:45.271 --> 26:47.565
We can try to get Amy back now.

26:47.647 --> 26:49.233
We have both time machines.

26:49.649 --> 26:50.984
No.

26:51.026 --> 26:52.570
-Yeah, but the stuff

26:51.026 --> 26:52.570
in the journal--

26:51.026 --> 26:52.570
-No, Wyatt.

26:52.610 --> 26:54.029
I've thought a lot about this.

26:56.449 --> 26:58.992
Look at all the awful things

26:56.449 --> 26:58.992
that Flynn did

26:59.034 --> 27:00.660
in the name

26:59.034 --> 27:00.660
of saving his family.

27:00.702 --> 27:03.080
Look what happened

27:00.702 --> 27:03.080
when you got Jessica back.

27:03.122 --> 27:06.833
I mean, I am so thankful

27:03.122 --> 27:06.833
that we saved Rufus,

27:06.875 --> 27:09.711
but it cost us Flynn.

27:09.753 --> 27:14.091
And if we're willing

27:09.753 --> 27:14.091
to use this machine to get back

27:09.753 --> 27:14.091
the things that we've lost,

27:14.133 --> 27:16.051
no matter the price, I mean...

27:16.093 --> 27:18.011
When will it end?

27:18.053 --> 27:20.055
We'd be no better

27:18.053 --> 27:20.055
than my mother or Emma.

27:31.233 --> 27:32.526
You sure you're okay with that?

27:33.277 --> 27:34.403
Of course not.

27:36.071 --> 27:39.699
But everybody loses

27:36.071 --> 27:39.699
someone that they love,

27:39.741 --> 27:42.286
and no matter how badly

27:39.741 --> 27:42.286
they want to,

27:39.741 --> 27:42.286
they can't get them back.

27:48.167 --> 27:50.294
And in spite of that,

27:48.167 --> 27:50.294
they find a way to go on.

27:53.713 --> 27:55.132
That's everyone's history.

28:04.016 --> 28:06.185
All right. [sighs] Well...

28:06.226 --> 28:07.936
Jiya said auto-pilot, right?

28:09.146 --> 28:10.730
You sure you know

28:09.146 --> 28:10.730
what you're doing?

28:11.148 --> 28:11.982
[chuckles]

28:14.151 --> 28:15.319
[console beeping]

28:19.406 --> 28:20.616
All right.

28:20.658 --> 28:23.160
Looks like we'll be home

28:20.658 --> 28:23.160
for Christmas after all.

28:44.056 --> 28:45.599
-We did it.

28:44.056 --> 28:45.599
-You did it.

28:45.641 --> 28:47.226
[Rufus] I knew I could do it.

28:47.267 --> 28:50.521
-Um, you were scared

28:47.267 --> 28:50.521
out of your mind.

28:47.267 --> 28:50.521
-I was mildly anxious.

28:50.563 --> 28:52.523
-You did it anyway. [laughs]

28:50.563 --> 28:52.523
-So much fun.

28:52.565 --> 28:54.024
You flew the<i> Mothership!</i>

28:54.066 --> 28:57.110
-Too bad it's being

28:54.066 --> 28:57.110
destroyed as we speak.

28:54.066 --> 28:57.110
-[sighs]

28:57.152 --> 28:59.697
Maybe we haven't

28:57.152 --> 28:59.697
changed so much after all.

28:59.738 --> 29:02.282
I am so glad

28:59.738 --> 29:02.282
to hear you say that.

29:04.201 --> 29:05.994
So, what now?

29:06.953 --> 29:07.954
What now, what?

29:10.666 --> 29:12.376
Well, we're gonna have

29:10.666 --> 29:12.376
to get new jobs.

29:13.085 --> 29:14.461
I guess so.

29:14.503 --> 29:16.505
Yeah, can't exactly put

29:14.503 --> 29:16.505
"time travel" on my resume.

29:16.547 --> 29:17.506
[Jiya] Mmm.

29:19.383 --> 29:21.510
You get to see

29:19.383 --> 29:21.510
your family again.

29:21.552 --> 29:24.054
They think I died in the

29:21.552 --> 29:24.054
explosion at Mason Industries.

29:24.096 --> 29:25.639
I'm making more

29:24.096 --> 29:25.639
comebacks than Elvis.

29:25.681 --> 29:27.391
You have practice.

29:27.433 --> 29:29.059
Guess I'll finally have

29:27.433 --> 29:29.059
to get my own place.

29:29.518 --> 29:30.810
I guess so.

29:30.852 --> 29:32.896
Still it was a lot of fun

29:30.852 --> 29:32.896
living together, right?

29:32.938 --> 29:34.064
Eh, it had its moments.

29:34.814 --> 29:36.983
Gonna miss it, sort of.

29:40.571 --> 29:43.198
Is this your awkward way

29:40.571 --> 29:43.198
of asking to move in with me?

29:43.240 --> 29:44.742
Way to take a hint, lady.

29:44.783 --> 29:46.076
[both chuckle]

29:47.244 --> 29:48.954
So, is that a yes?

29:52.082 --> 29:53.292
-Yeah?

29:52.082 --> 29:53.292
-Yeah, yeah. [laughs]

29:53.333 --> 29:55.252
-Yeah. [laughs]

29:53.333 --> 29:55.252
-That's a yes, that's a yes.

29:55.294 --> 29:57.087
That's a yes. It'll work.

29:57.129 --> 29:59.131
[Rufus mumbling]

29:59.172 --> 30:01.216
-[Lucy] Hey. Listen to this.

29:59.172 --> 30:01.216
-Yeah.

30:01.258 --> 30:06.012
Young-Hee died in 2007.

30:01.258 --> 30:06.012
She lived well into her 80s.

30:06.054 --> 30:08.932
Tae-Woo's

30:06.054 --> 30:08.932
a retired investment banker

30:06.054 --> 30:08.932
in Seoul.

30:08.974 --> 30:12.394
Their daughter is a teacher,

30:08.974 --> 30:12.394
just like their mother.

30:12.436 --> 30:14.104
-Two kids.

30:12.436 --> 30:14.104
-Wow.

30:15.981 --> 30:19.109
Sounds like a crazy,

30:15.981 --> 30:19.109
ordinary, wonderful life.

30:19.151 --> 30:20.193
Thanks to you.

30:22.154 --> 30:23.614
No.

30:23.656 --> 30:25.491
That was your call.

30:25.532 --> 30:27.326
You're the one who said

30:25.532 --> 30:27.326
everyone's important.

30:27.367 --> 30:28.744
Maybe not to history,

30:28.786 --> 30:31.163
but everybody is important

30:28.786 --> 30:31.163
to someone, I think.

30:32.164 --> 30:33.123
[Wyatt chuckles]

30:33.165 --> 30:34.207
Careful.

30:36.168 --> 30:37.210
[both chuckle]

30:37.252 --> 30:38.920
How'd that get there?

30:38.962 --> 30:41.214
Apparently, Agent Christopher

30:38.962 --> 30:41.214
has a dirtier mind

30:38.962 --> 30:41.214
than we thought.

30:43.925 --> 30:45.927
I mean, it is a custom.

30:45.969 --> 30:47.137
-All right?

30:45.969 --> 30:47.137
-Mmm!

30:57.189 --> 30:59.399
That's the first time

30:57.189 --> 30:59.399
we've done that in the present.

30:59.441 --> 31:02.235
I mean, our present.

30:59.441 --> 31:02.235
I mean, 2018.

31:02.277 --> 31:03.445
[Wyatt] Hmm.

31:03.487 --> 31:05.823
Well, it's gonna be 2019 soon.

31:05.864 --> 31:06.990
True.

31:07.032 --> 31:08.742
So maybe we should...

31:09.951 --> 31:11.328
Make up for lost time?

31:32.391 --> 31:33.517
This one is for you.

31:34.142 --> 31:35.018
Uh, okay.

31:35.060 --> 31:37.020
This one for you.

31:37.062 --> 31:38.146
This one is for you.

31:38.188 --> 31:39.105
[Lucy] Hmm!

31:38.188 --> 31:39.105
[Wyatt] Oh.

31:39.147 --> 31:40.399
[Denise] And there you go.

31:40.440 --> 31:42.609
Wow. You shouldn't

31:40.440 --> 31:42.609
have, really.

31:43.569 --> 31:45.195
[laughing]

31:43.569 --> 31:45.195
Really shouldn't have.

31:45.237 --> 31:46.572
[Jiya] It's the thought

31:45.237 --> 31:46.572
that counts.

31:46.613 --> 31:47.947
And the thought

31:46.613 --> 31:47.947
was what exactly?

31:47.989 --> 31:49.115
Hey!

31:49.157 --> 31:50.367
Uh...

31:50.409 --> 31:51.451
It's lovely.

31:53.620 --> 31:54.705
Guys...

31:56.582 --> 31:58.083
We did it.

31:58.124 --> 32:00.878
We stopped Rittenhouse.

32:01.754 --> 32:02.755
We won.

32:04.631 --> 32:06.425
-Cheers.

32:07.300 --> 32:08.427
Flynn would be proud.

32:09.720 --> 32:10.763
Yes, he would have.

32:12.138 --> 32:14.057
So, was this our

32:12.138 --> 32:14.057
last morning together?

32:14.099 --> 32:15.893
You know, as a family?

32:15.934 --> 32:19.897
Yep. As of 0900 hours,

32:15.934 --> 32:19.897
you are all free to go.

32:19.938 --> 32:20.898
Except for you.

32:20.939 --> 32:22.399
The paperwork came through.

32:22.441 --> 32:25.193
You're officially assigned

32:22.441 --> 32:25.193
to Special Projects with me.

32:25.235 --> 32:26.612
No one I'd rather report to.

32:32.284 --> 32:34.244
You look bloody ridiculous.

32:34.286 --> 32:37.372
My children compete to find me

32:34.286 --> 32:37.372
the ugliest Christmas sweater.

32:37.414 --> 32:38.373
And Mark won.

32:38.415 --> 32:39.833
I wear it with pride.

32:39.875 --> 32:41.251
Well, at least take

32:39.875 --> 32:41.251
that bloody thing

32:39.875 --> 32:41.251
off your head.

32:41.293 --> 32:43.295
You look like some

32:41.293 --> 32:43.295
sort of drunk elf.

32:43.336 --> 32:45.964
You get a lump of coal

32:43.336 --> 32:45.964
in your stocking or what?

32:46.005 --> 32:47.466
[chuckles] No, just this.

32:48.508 --> 32:49.551
[Denise] What's that?

32:49.593 --> 32:51.637
All that's left

32:49.593 --> 32:51.637
of the<i> Mothership.</i>

32:51.678 --> 32:54.347
-I'm sorry, Connor.

32:51.678 --> 32:54.347
-Oh... Don't be.

32:54.389 --> 32:55.891
There's one thing I've learnt.

32:55.933 --> 32:58.518
A machine that powerful is too

32:55.933 --> 32:58.518
dangerous in anyone's hands.

32:58.560 --> 33:01.480
Now, I suppose, we need to

32:58.560 --> 33:01.480
disassemble the<i> Lifeboat.</i>

33:01.521 --> 33:03.106
We're keeping the<i> Lifeboat.</i>

33:05.525 --> 33:07.444
A wise man once told me

33:07.486 --> 33:10.864
that if it's possible

33:07.486 --> 33:10.864
to build a time machine,

33:07.486 --> 33:10.864
someone will build it,

33:10.906 --> 33:12.407
and we'll need

33:10.906 --> 33:12.407
a way to stop them.

33:12.449 --> 33:15.494
So the<i> Lifeboat</i> stays here,

33:12.449 --> 33:15.494
under armed guard.

33:34.179 --> 33:35.889
-[Tegan] Professor Preston?

33:34.179 --> 33:35.889
-Yeah.

33:35.931 --> 33:38.767
So, you're saying

33:35.931 --> 33:38.767
that without Alice Paul,

33:38.809 --> 33:40.727
Grace Humiston is just

33:38.809 --> 33:40.727
a detective in New York?

33:40.769 --> 33:42.270
That's right.

33:42.312 --> 33:44.940
-How do you know?

33:42.312 --> 33:44.940
-Trust me, I know.

33:44.982 --> 33:46.441
-Okay.

33:44.982 --> 33:46.441
-[laughing] Okay.

33:46.483 --> 33:48.193
Hey, have a happy holiday

33:48.234 --> 33:49.611
and don't forget to review

33:48.234 --> 33:49.611
the Harriet Tubman material,

33:48.234 --> 33:49.611
all right?

33:49.653 --> 33:50.696
-Okay. Bye.

33:49.653 --> 33:50.696
-Okay. See you soon.

33:50.737 --> 33:52.531
-Bye, Tegan. Yeah?

33:50.737 --> 33:52.531
-Hey.

We were hoping to get a better

35:05.604 --> 35:10.108
shorter than usual.

We all started somewhere.

35:12.903 --> 35:16.073
When Rufus and I started

35:12.903 --> 35:16.073
to build a better future.

Rufus,

35:39.471 --> 35:40.597
[Paulina] Thank you.

How come nobody

asks for my autograph?

You know,

You're never gonna

35:55.028 --> 35:56.571
stop saying that, are you?

35:56.613 --> 35:57.990
Yeah. No, why would I?

36:05.914 --> 36:08.750
The twins are in their pajamas,

36:05.914 --> 36:08.750
and they are brushing

36:05.914 --> 36:08.750
their teeth.

36:08.792 --> 36:10.794
They're so excited

36:08.792 --> 36:10.794
about their sleepover.

36:10.836 --> 36:13.212
When I told them that Mommy

36:10.836 --> 36:13.212
and Daddy used to live here,

36:13.254 --> 36:14.881
they didn't believe me.

36:14.923 --> 36:17.216
-[laughs]

36:14.923 --> 36:17.216
-That's because, like most

36:17.258 --> 36:18.802
it's utterly uninhabitable

Think we'd let you do it alone?

36:58.675 --> 37:02.054
Yeah. Three of us started it,

36:58.675 --> 37:02.054
so let's finish it.
