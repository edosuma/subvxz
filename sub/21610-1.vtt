24:01.149 --> 24:02.234

our routine to post.

24:02.526 --> 24:03.902
But the new boys are still
learning the routines.

24:03.985 --> 24:06.446

shine in 15 seconds?

24:56.621 --> 24:59.624
Hey, Destiny, out with the
old, in with the new.

We're going to
take you down.

25:11.428 --> 25:13.680
ALL: Singapore out.

25:13.930 --> 25:16.641
I can't believe that
I used to be a fan.

25:17.309 --> 25:20.520
But I can't wait to
see you fall on your ass.

25:20.604 --> 25:22.105
(CHUCKLES) Oops.

25:26.276 --> 25:29.571
I hear you got my guys involved
in some sort of cheer war.

25:29.863 --> 25:32.741
Isn't that sort of an oxymoron,
fighting cheerleaders?

25:32.866 --> 25:35.368
(CHUCKLES) Hello? Some of the best
battles on the football field happen

25:35.452 --> 25:37.287

cheerleaders.

25:37.704 --> 25:41.041
I've never really been big
on pep rallies, or sports,

25:41.124 --> 25:42.500
or pom-pom girls
for that matter.

25:42.584 --> 25:44.294
Oh, Blake,
I'm heartbroken.

25:45.754 --> 25:46.963
Thought you would be.

25:58.433 --> 25:59.643
(SLURPS)

26:01.019 --> 26:02.562
So what exactly
are you into?

26:02.979 --> 26:04.064
I hardly know
anything about you

26:04.147 --> 26:05.732
since you don't exist
on social media.

26:05.815 --> 26:06.900
Yeah, not my thing.

26:06.983 --> 26:09.069
What are you talking about?
It's everybody's thing.

26:09.444 --> 26:12.155
You're nobody unless you have
tons of friends or followers.

existed before the Internet.

26:14.741 --> 26:16.117
(SCOFFS)

26:16.660 --> 26:17.744
So what is your thing then?

26:19.496 --> 26:23.917
Well, I've got this quiet,
introvert, artistic appeal going.

26:25.085 --> 26:26.336
You're not feeling it?

26:26.419 --> 26:27.504
(SLURPS)

26:28.129 --> 26:31.007
What I'm feeling is hunger.
That was my dinner.

Next one's on me.
Is that so?

26:35.720 --> 26:38.807
And, hey, don't make my boys
look bad, okay?

26:39.015 --> 26:40.976
Your short shorts aren't the only
reason they roll with you now.

26:41.059 --> 26:42.102
Yeah, I know.
They lost a bet.

26:42.185 --> 26:43.770
That and you come off
like somebody.

26:43.853 --> 26:45.105
So what? They're, like,
really invested in this?

26:45.188 --> 26:46.189
Yeah.

26:46.940 --> 26:49.317
But I'm sure you're used to holding
it down for your team, right?

26:49.484 --> 26:50.902
You won't let them down.

26:55.782 --> 26:57.033
I got to be somewhere.

on something for the routine.

but it's a little different.

Oh, and I guess
I don't either.

There's a reason why I am captain.

29:50.832 --> 29:52.625
You're captain because
we let you be captain.

that I'm captain.

in line?

be back here to work it off.

nerve to kiss the other.

35:57.406 --> 35:58.950
And then everyone knows
we're crushing

35:59.033 --> 36:01.828
because we make googly eyes
and dash off to secret places

36:01.911 --> 36:03.496
where no one can find us.

36:03.579 --> 36:04.997
You've played this game
before, haven't you?

36:05.081 --> 36:06.874
Maybe. You?

36:06.958 --> 36:08.292
Maybe.

36:09.585 --> 36:12.004
But not as much
as I want to now.

36:15.258 --> 36:16.259
I can't.

36:18.386 --> 36:19.637
With this whole
Internet challenge

36:19.720 --> 36:21.013
and half my squad
being newbies

36:21.097 --> 36:24.934
and Willow hating me, I could not
add boy problems to this mix.

36:26.269 --> 36:27.937
How do you know
I'd be a problem?

36:28.938 --> 36:30.314
Cheer with us.

36:33.442 --> 36:34.569
No.

36:35.069 --> 36:37.446
See, that's a problem.

37:05.308 --> 37:08.561
Dear Diary, you know I'm under
cyber-attacks from cheer hacks

37:08.644 --> 37:10.396
who have pitted my team
against the world,

37:10.479 --> 37:12.607
which, to be honest,
kind of excites me

37:12.690 --> 37:13.941
because I love
a good challenge.

37:14.317 --> 37:17.695
But, come on. My best
friend has turned on me.

37:17.778 --> 37:20.406
I'm trying to make these
ghetto-ass street dancers

37:20.489 --> 37:22.783
into cheerlebrities,
which is probably impossible.

37:23.451 --> 37:25.786
And now you drop this
gorgeous guy into my life.

37:25.870 --> 37:27.830
Why me? Why now?

37:28.039 --> 37:30.416
Why can't I go back to my
perfect cheerlebrity existence

37:30.499 --> 37:32.418
when everything
was about me?

37:33.794 --> 37:36.756
The guys that I've recruited
are still dancers at heart.

37:36.839 --> 37:38.591
And I may have been
wrong about thinking

37:38.674 --> 37:40.760
they could become
even decent cheerleaders.

37:40.843 --> 37:43.054
I mean, my own cheerleaders
can't even take on the world.

37:43.137 --> 37:44.096
They too have their limits.

37:44.180 --> 37:45.765
<i>I can only take them so far.</i>

37:46.974 --> 37:49.268
<i>Okay, I don't want to start
sounding ungrateful,</i>

37:49.352 --> 37:52.063
but could you grant
The Rebels a few miracles

37:52.146 --> 37:54.899
and help us come together
to kick some serious ass?

38:10.247 --> 38:11.624
Five, six, seven, eight.

38:11.707 --> 38:15.378
One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

38:15.461 --> 38:17.964
One, two, three, four,
five, six...

38:21.092 --> 38:22.635

Aunty Em?

38:25.429 --> 38:27.848

38:29.183 --> 38:31.143
Damn it, Didit,
that's the third one.

38:31.227 --> 38:32.269
Seriously,
these chicks are real.

38:32.353 --> 38:34.480
They're not made of plastic
like your little girlfriend.

38:34.563 --> 38:36.649
Dude, I was not the only one
who was supposed to catch her.

38:36.732 --> 38:38.359
If you weren't so busy
trying to touch her butt,

38:38.442 --> 38:39.694
we wouldn't have missed.
You're right.

38:39.777 --> 38:40.903
I need to grow up.

38:40.987 --> 38:42.238
Yes, it's childish, dude.

38:42.321 --> 38:43.322
That's all I'm saying.

38:43.406 --> 38:45.491
Look, you both
need to grow up.

38:45.574 --> 38:47.827
You guys need to stop
breaking my cheerleaders.

38:47.910 --> 38:50.705
I'm sorry. Like, we don't
want anybody to get hurt.

38:50.788 --> 38:52.498
We'll do better.
Right, Jeff?

38:52.581 --> 38:55.710
Yeah. She seems
okay to me. (CHUCKLES)

38:55.793 --> 38:57.211
It's like that joke, right?

38:57.253 --> 38:59.588
Why do cheerleaders wear their hair up?
Not a good time, dude!

38:59.672 --> 39:03.092
It's to catch everything that
goes over their heads. (LAUGHS)

39:04.427 --> 39:05.428
Come on. It's funny.

39:05.511 --> 39:07.179
No. You know
what's not funny?

39:07.263 --> 39:08.889
Guys like you who
don't take it seriously.

39:08.973 --> 39:10.725
I told you, dude.
You're on your own.

39:11.058 --> 39:12.435
Cheerleaders are strong.

39:15.104 --> 39:16.272

unless the person against us

39:21.235 --> 39:24.488
is stomped into
the ground or with us.

39:25.448 --> 39:26.741
Okay, I get it.

39:37.626 --> 39:38.878
Are you okay?

39:39.795 --> 39:40.921
Hey, it was just
an accident.

39:41.005 --> 39:42.131
No, it's not that.

I've been thinking about it

But this Internet competition

47:44.363 --> 47:46.114

of cheer.

47:46.698 --> 47:48.909

from watching squads

saying that Destiny won</i>

47:54.248 --> 47:57.125

and not her talent?</i>

<i>LEADER: That's right.</i>

47:58.293 --> 48:02.214
<i>Destiny won't be able to hide because
these squads are coming for her.</i>

on the world wide web.</i>

<i>Soon she will be stripped
of her cheerlebrity status</i>

48:09.555 --> 48:11.890

fraud that she truly is.</i>

We did win because of your reputation,
not because we were the best.

48:40.460 --> 48:41.962
We won.
That's all that matters.

48:42.045 --> 48:44.131
It makes a huge difference
if we didn't deserve it.

are you guys on?

need to talk about this.

I can find Blake?

50:46.128 --> 50:47.129
Hey.

Is this legal?
Come on up.

51:01.643 --> 51:03.270
BLAKE: And then
I got arrested.

51:03.353 --> 51:04.604
And just before
my court date,

51:04.688 --> 51:06.148
I found out
the district attorney

51:06.231 --> 51:08.775
was a fan of my work
and so was the mayor.

51:09.317 --> 51:12.362
So now I'm commissioned to
do murals around the city.

51:12.446 --> 51:13.613
Why didn't you tell me?

51:13.697 --> 51:15.240
Hey, it was hard enough
staying legit

51:15.323 --> 51:16.825

makes you feel more creative.

51:22.038 --> 51:23.707
Sort of. Yeah.

51:25.500 --> 51:28.462
And using my art to pick
up girls is kind of lame.

I think I would have been impressed.

51:33.842 --> 51:35.594
Can I ask you a question?

Sure.

51:37.554 --> 51:39.181
Are you crazy?

51:39.264 --> 51:43.143
I mean, I only ask because the last
time I saw you, you went off on me.

I know. I know.
I was having a bad day.

51:45.729 --> 51:46.938
Yeah, I heard.

51:49.107 --> 51:50.567
So today's better then?

51:52.027 --> 51:55.405
Yeah, it was.
Once I saw my mural.

51:55.906 --> 51:56.990
Oh, so it's your mural?

51:57.073 --> 51:58.867
Oh, you know
what I mean.

52:00.368 --> 52:02.204
Why did you do it? Why me?

52:04.206 --> 52:05.540
Because I saw something.

52:05.624 --> 52:06.666
Yeah, what's that?

Are you really
going to ask me?

No, it was so sweet.

something like this?

would say one thing to your face

behind your back.

No, I recorded this
weeks ago.

doing this to me?

I did not record this
last night.

those mean, awful, hateful things.

with what we have.

that we can do with a small crew.

Okay. You're starting to sound
a lot like the old Destiny.

01:01:14.088 --> 01:01:16.424
Well, if you like
the new Destiny so much,

01:01:16.507 --> 01:01:17.967
why don't you go join her?

01:01:18.051 --> 01:01:20.511

for people who doubt me.

for your crap. (SCOFFS)

was still good though, right?

how to get the boys back.

her claws into half of them

about this place?

kind of have to know somebody.

something you're not telling me.

some of your boys away.

You called them ghetto.
And not in a good way.

never said that

even if I thought no one
was gonna hear it.

This is why I don't deal with
social media and all that crap.

get the guys back?

be straight with them.

silent treatment. Yes.

walked up to them,

01:05:50.656 --> 01:05:52.950
said something,
and they wouldn't respond?

in person?

done that yet.

gonna do with it?

onto it for the rest of our date.

come back to the squad.

to me 'cause I know you like me.

business was foul.

fempossible for me to admit,

since you guys left.

and change everything about us.

our style. My jokes.

joined up with you,

we thought it was because
we'd actually add something.

gonna use us for muscle.

01:07:47.982 --> 01:07:50.609
Oh, wow. Did we reverse sexism them?
I believe we did.

01:07:50.693 --> 01:07:51.861

01:07:56.115 --> 01:07:59.034

more than we realized.

thought about that

have to practice.
