WEBVTT

00:02.627 --> 00:04.045
PREVIOUSLY
ON <i>KITCHEN NIGHTMARES...</i>

00:04.045 --> 00:06.214
CHEF RAMSAY WAS BACK
IN SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.

00:06.214 --> 00:07.966
HOLY CRAP.

00:07.966 --> 00:09.634
BUT IT WAS FAR
FROM A DAY AT THE BEACH.

00:09.634 --> 00:11.678
WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IS SO WRONG.

00:11.678 --> 00:12.971
NO.

00:12.971 --> 00:14.681
ZAYNA FLAMING GRILL

00:14.681 --> 00:17.934
MAY HAVE BEEN A DREAM OF FAY AND
HER PARTNER AND NIECE BRENDA...

00:17.934 --> 00:19.102
LET'S ROCK AND ROLL.

00:19.102 --> 00:20.478
BUT THIS MEDITERRANEAN
RESTAURANT

00:20.478 --> 00:23.523
IN REDONDO BEACH HAS BECOME
A TRUE NIGHTMARE.

00:23.523 --> 00:28.194
WHEN I PUT THE MEAT SOMEWHERE
IN THE GRILL, DO NOT MOVE IT!

00:28.194 --> 00:30.000
RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING,
THIS PARTNERSHIP

00:30.000 --> 00:30.071
RIGHT FROM THE BEGINNING,
THIS PARTNERSHIP

00:30.071 --> 00:31.239
WAS TROUBLED WITH MANY ISSUES.

00:31.239 --> 00:32.324
IT'S DONE.

00:32.324 --> 00:34.284
YEAH, IT WAS ON THAT SIDE.
IT'S ON.

00:34.284 --> 00:36.369
FAY CLAIMS THAT NOT ONLY WILL
THE RESTAURANT

00:36.369 --> 00:39.080
NOT FUNCTION WITHOUT HER...

00:39.080 --> 00:40.790
- WHAT?
- BUT THAT SHE IS

00:40.790 --> 00:42.042
THE ONLY ONE PUTTING IN
A REAL EFFORT.

00:42.042 --> 00:44.836
I JUST WANT MORE HELP.

00:44.836 --> 00:46.087
BRENDA CLAIMS FAY IS A MARTYR...

00:46.087 --> 00:48.089
YOU DON'T LET ANYBODY
HELP YOU.

00:48.089 --> 00:49.841
NOT WILLING TO LET
ANYONE HELP...

00:49.841 --> 00:51.384
YOU'RE NOT BEING SHOWN
THE RECIPES?
NO.

00:51.384 --> 00:53.595
AND THAT IS WHY
SHE HAS GIVEN UP.

00:53.595 --> 00:56.181
I'M GONNA GO SIT DOWN
IN MY BOOTH.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.000
BOTH OWNERS DID AGREE
THAT THEIR FOOD WAS EXCELLENT.

01:00.000 --> 01:00.143
BOTH OWNERS DID AGREE
THAT THEIR FOOD WAS EXCELLENT.

01:00.143 --> 01:03.313
CHEF RAMSAY, THERE IS NO WAY
HE WOULD DISLIKE MY FOOD.

01:03.313 --> 01:04.439
BUT IT DIDN'T TAKE LONG

01:04.439 --> 01:06.066
FOR CHEF RAMSAY TO REALIZE...

01:06.066 --> 01:07.609
- IT'S GROSS.
- THAT IT WAS ANYTHING BUT.

01:07.609 --> 01:09.277
IT LOOKS LIKE SOMEONE'S PUKED UP
ON MY PLATE.

01:09.277 --> 01:10.528
AW, COME ON.

01:10.528 --> 01:11.613
WHEN GORDON GAVE THEM
A WAKE-UP CALL

01:11.613 --> 01:12.947
ON THE FOOD...

01:12.947 --> 01:14.491
ALL YOU'RE DOING IS DAMAGING
YOUR BUSINESS.

01:14.491 --> 01:16.368
I NEED HELP.

01:16.368 --> 01:18.036
FAY REFUSED TO TAKE ANY
OF THE BLAME.

01:18.036 --> 01:19.037
SO WHO'S NOT PULLING
THEIR WEIGHT?

01:19.037 --> 01:21.665
NONE OF THEM.
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

01:21.665 --> 01:23.500
WHICH LED TO THE STAFF
PLAYING THE BLAME GAME.

01:23.500 --> 01:25.126
IF YOU WANT TO START POINTING
FINGERS, BRENDA,

01:25.126 --> 01:27.253
AFTER YOU SWEPT,
IT'S BEEN DIRTY.

01:27.253 --> 01:30.000
SERVER AMEL POINTED OUT
FAY'S STUBBORNNESS.

01:30.000 --> 01:30.256
SERVER AMEL POINTED OUT
FAY'S STUBBORNNESS.

01:30.256 --> 01:31.675
I'VE OFFERED TO CUT CHICKEN
MULTIPLE TIMES,

01:31.675 --> 01:34.260
AND I WAS TOLD THAT
I WASN'T ALLOWED TO DO IT.

01:34.260 --> 01:35.387
<i>I OFFERED.</i>
NO, SHE NEVER DID.

01:35.387 --> 01:37.263
AND FAY DISAGREED
WHOLEHEARTEDLY.

01:37.263 --> 01:38.807
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

01:38.807 --> 01:39.974
AT DINNER SERVICE...

01:39.974 --> 01:41.267
ALL THE CHICKEN IS DONE.

01:41.267 --> 01:43.228
THE FIGHTING
IN THE KITCHEN CONTINUED.

01:43.228 --> 01:44.270
<i>BRENDA, PUT MORE CHILI.</i>

01:44.270 --> 01:46.231
THAT'S WHY I CUT
THESE JALAPENOS.

01:46.231 --> 01:47.440
USE THEM.
WHATEVER.

01:47.440 --> 01:48.441
AND CUSTOMERS WERE DISAPPOINTED

01:48.441 --> 01:49.442
WITH WHAT
THEY WERE RECEIVING.

01:49.442 --> 01:50.819
THAT'S DISGUSTING.

01:50.819 --> 01:52.195
INCLUDING
A MEDITERRANEAN STAPLE,

01:52.195 --> 01:53.113
THE HUMMUS.

01:53.113 --> 01:54.280
MY APOLOGIES.

01:54.280 --> 01:55.615
CHEF RAMSAY SET OUT TO PROVE

01:55.615 --> 01:57.617
HOW SUBSTANDARD
THEIR FOOD REALLY IS...

01:57.617 --> 01:59.119
LADIES, THERE WE ARE.
SOME FRESH HUMMUS.

01:59.119 --> 02:00.000
BY GIVING CUSTOMERS
STORE-BOUGHT HUMMUS...

02:00.000 --> 02:02.038
BY GIVING CUSTOMERS
STORE-BOUGHT HUMMUS...

02:03.665 --> 02:05.667
WHICH TEMPORARILY...

02:05.667 --> 02:07.293
PLEASED MANY OF THE DINERS.

02:07.293 --> 02:08.294
BUT UNFORTUNATELY...

02:08.294 --> 02:10.088
THIS CHICKEN WAS JUST NASTY.

02:10.088 --> 02:12.090
THE HUMMUS WAS JUST ONE
OF MANY PROBLEMS.

02:12.090 --> 02:13.258
OH, NO.

02:13.258 --> 02:15.343
SHE SAID SHE DIDN'T
LIKE IT AT ALL.

02:15.343 --> 02:17.095
WHEN CHEF RAMSAY DID
AN INVESTIGATION...

02:17.095 --> 02:18.263
UGH.

02:18.263 --> 02:20.265
HE UNCOVERED TERRIBLE PRACTICES

02:20.265 --> 02:21.099
IN THE REFRIGERATOR
AND FREEZER.

02:21.099 --> 02:22.559
IT'S ALL FREEZER-BURNT.

02:22.559 --> 02:24.686
HE ALSO FOUND
COUNTLESS CONTAINERS

02:24.686 --> 02:26.271
FILLED WITH FROZEN FOOD.

02:26.271 --> 02:27.230
CAN I SHOW YOU SOMETHING,

02:27.230 --> 02:28.690
JUST TWO SECONDS?
SURE, SURE.

02:28.690 --> 02:30.000
WHEN IT WAS TIME
TO CONFRONT FAY...

02:30.000 --> 02:30.233
WHEN IT WAS TIME
TO CONFRONT FAY...

02:30.233 --> 02:31.234
GET REAL.

02:31.234 --> 02:33.027
I AM.
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

02:33.027 --> 02:34.696
AT FIRST,
SHE REMAINED IN DENIAL.

02:34.696 --> 02:35.697
NO.

02:35.697 --> 02:36.865
THEN SUDDENLY...

02:36.865 --> 02:39.284
I FEEL LIKE
I'M HANGING BY A THREAD.

02:39.284 --> 02:41.202
SHE REALIZED HOW DEEP A HOLE

02:41.202 --> 02:43.246
SHE HAS DUG FOR HERSELF.

02:43.246 --> 02:46.249
I'VE BEEN PRAYING AND SAYING
TOMORROW WOULD BE A BETTER DAY.

02:46.249 --> 02:48.918
NOW, WITH FAY
COMPLETELY OVERWHELMED...

02:48.918 --> 02:51.129
THAT BETTER DAY IS NOT COMING.

02:51.129 --> 02:52.797
CHEF RAMSAY HAS SERIOUS DOUBTS

02:52.797 --> 02:55.508
ABOUT WHETHER A TURNAROUND
IS EVEN POSSIBLE.

02:59.179 --> 03:00.000
THIS IS CRAZY.

03:00.000 --> 03:00.680
THIS IS CRAZY.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.098
IT'S THE EXPLOSIVE CONCLUSION

03:02.098 --> 03:03.308
OF ZAYNA FLAMING GRILL.

03:03.308 --> 03:05.226
I EVEN TOLD YOU,
"WRITE DOWN WHAT I TELL YOU."

03:05.226 --> 03:06.269
ONE TIME!

03:06.269 --> 03:07.437
ARE YOU  KIDDING ME?

03:07.437 --> 03:09.230
THE FIGHTING ACTUALLY ESCALATES.

03:09.230 --> 03:12.192
NOBODY WANTS TO HELP HER
BECAUSE SHE'S SO CRITICAL!

03:12.192 --> 03:14.068
AND NO ONE IS BACKING DOWN.

03:14.068 --> 03:15.528
GO. GO.

03:15.528 --> 03:17.238
DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT.
GO!

03:17.238 --> 03:18.573
CHEF RAMSAY IS STUCK
IN THE MIDDLE

03:18.573 --> 03:20.200
OF A SEEMINGLY HOPELESS
RESTAURANT.

03:20.200 --> 03:21.826
FAY. FAY.

03:21.826 --> 03:24.287
SHE WON'T CHANGE, AND THERE'S
NO QUESTION ABOUT IT.

03:24.287 --> 03:25.830
WILL HE BE ABLE
TO HELP FAY AND BRENDA

03:25.830 --> 03:27.123
RESOLVE THEIR DIFFERENCES?

03:27.123 --> 03:28.833
FAY HAS SHUT DOWN.

03:28.833 --> 03:30.000
OR WILL ONE OF THEM...
YOU...

03:30.000 --> 03:30.668
OR WILL ONE OF THEM...
YOU...

03:30.668 --> 03:32.170
BE FORCED TO LEAVE THE BUSINESS?

03:32.170 --> 03:34.214
ARE GOING HOME.

03:36.758 --> 03:37.967
WHAT IS THAT?

03:37.967 --> 03:39.677
YOU'RE SERVING ROTTEN FOOD.

03:39.677 --> 03:40.803
THEY'RE NOT CRAP.
THEY'RE DELICIOUS.

03:40.803 --> 03:43.223
THEN WAKE UP!
YOU WAKE UP!

03:43.223 --> 03:44.057
SHUT THE PLACE DOWN.

03:44.057 --> 03:45.225
GET OUT OF HERE!

03:45.225 --> 03:47.227
<i>THAT IS AMAZING.</i>

03:47.227 --> 03:49.354
THAT'S EMBARRASSING!
OH, GOD!

03:49.354 --> 03:52.732
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

03:57.153 --> 03:59.322
I DON'T THINK YOU UNDERSTAND
HOW FAR YOU'VE SLIPPED.

03:59.322 --> 04:00.000
GET REAL.

04:00.000 --> 04:00.907
GET REAL.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.617
I AM.
NO, YOU'RE NOT.

04:02.617 --> 04:06.246
WHY AREN'T YOUR CUSTOMERS COMING
BACK TO YOUR RESTAURANT, FAY?

04:06.246 --> 04:07.330
<i>I DON'T KNOW.</i>

04:07.330 --> 04:11.084
TONIGHT WAS A SHOCK TO ME.
LIKE, WOW.

04:11.084 --> 04:14.045
WHY EVERYTHING
IS COMING BACK?

04:14.045 --> 04:18.174
THERE ARE CERTAIN PLATES I'M
VERY PROUD OF, AND IT CAME BACK.

04:18.174 --> 04:21.177
BUT IT'S NOT GOOD ENOUGH.

04:21.177 --> 04:23.096
WHAT YOU'RE DOING
IS SO WRONG.

04:23.096 --> 04:25.306
FLAMING GRILL, IT'S NOT.

04:25.306 --> 04:27.600
EXTINGUISHED GRILL, IT IS.

04:27.600 --> 04:30.000
AND THE PROBLEMS, FAY,
ARE INSIDE.

04:30.000 --> 04:32.480
AND THE PROBLEMS, FAY,
ARE INSIDE.

04:32.480 --> 04:36.526
DO YOU WANT THIS BUSINESS
TO CONTINUE?

04:36.526 --> 04:40.238
I FEEL LIKE
I'M HANGING BY A THREAD.

04:50.665 --> 04:54.168
I'VE BEEN PRAYING AND SAYING
TOMORROW WOULD BE A BETTER DAY.

04:56.921 --> 05:00.000
THAT BETTER DAY IS NOT COMING.

05:00.000 --> 05:01.217
THAT BETTER DAY IS NOT COMING.

05:01.217 --> 05:04.137
I'M DONE.

05:08.349 --> 05:10.560
I JUST HAVE NOTHING ELSE.

05:22.071 --> 05:26.534
I CAN SEE THE SADNESS.

05:26.534 --> 05:28.786
I'M SO SORRY.

05:28.786 --> 05:30.000
I'M JUST OVERWHELMED.

05:30.000 --> 05:31.748
I'M JUST OVERWHELMED.

05:31.748 --> 05:34.167
<i>NO, NO,</i>
<i>PLEASE DON'T BE OVERWHELMED,</i>

05:34.167 --> 05:36.586
BUT JUST ANSWER THIS FOR ME.

05:36.586 --> 05:40.548
<i>DO YOU WANT TO CONTINUE?</i>

05:40.548 --> 05:42.258
I DO.

05:42.258 --> 05:44.260
<i>THIS IS ALL I HAVE.</i>

05:44.260 --> 05:45.470
I'M JUST BURNED OUT.

05:45.470 --> 05:47.513
I OVERWORK.
<i>I KNOW.</i>

05:47.513 --> 05:53.227
BUT ARE YOU 100% SURE
THAT YOU WANT TO CONTINUE

05:53.227 --> 05:55.813
IN THIS BUSINESS?

05:59.776 --> 06:00.000
I DO.

06:00.000 --> 06:01.444
I DO.

06:01.444 --> 06:03.446
<i>I LOVE WHAT I DO.</i>

06:03.446 --> 06:06.658
TONIGHT IT DIDN'T SHOW
BECAUSE I REALLY DIDN'T LOVE

06:06.658 --> 06:08.034
THE WAY THINGS WERE GOING.

06:08.034 --> 06:12.288
OKAY, UM...
I'M GETTING OUT OF HERE.

06:12.288 --> 06:15.458
<i>I WANT YOU TO CHANGE</i>
<i>YOUR ATTITUDE,</i>

06:15.458 --> 06:18.252
BECAUSE IF YOU CAN'T CHANGE
WHAT YOU'RE DOING,

06:18.252 --> 06:23.633
WE HAVE NO CHANCE IN TRYING
TO CHANGE THIS RESTAURANT.

06:23.633 --> 06:26.052
YES.
I HOPE TO SEE YOU TOMORROW.

06:26.052 --> 06:29.514
THANK YOU, SIR.

06:35.061 --> 06:38.523
THIS IS IT.
THIS IS MY LIFE.

06:38.523 --> 06:41.901
AND IF IT DOESN'T WORK...

06:46.322 --> 06:49.659
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

06:49.659 --> 06:52.245
YOU GOT TWO SECONDS?

06:59.877 --> 07:00.000
UH, YEAH, THAT WAS ROUGH.
ROUGH.

07:00.000 --> 07:03.172
UH, YEAH, THAT WAS ROUGH.
ROUGH.

07:03.172 --> 07:04.590
AND I'M GONNA CALL IT
AS I SEE IT.

07:04.590 --> 07:07.468
<i>YOU GUYS ARE JUST GOING</i>
<i>THROUGH THE MOTIONS.</i>

07:07.468 --> 07:08.845
<i>AND WHEN SOMETHING GOES WRONG,</i>

07:08.845 --> 07:10.263
YOU FALL OUT WITH YOUR AUNTIE,
SHE FALLS OUT WITH YOU,

07:10.263 --> 07:11.431
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN,

07:11.431 --> 07:13.141
YOU THEN JUST GO
BACK INTO YOUR OWN CORNERS.

07:13.141 --> 07:15.393
AND THE ONLY PEOPLE SUFFERING
ARE THE CUSTOMERS.

07:15.393 --> 07:18.938
ALL NIGHT LONG, THE PROBLEMS ARE
ON THE OUTSIDE.

07:18.938 --> 07:20.732
THE PROBLEMS ARE THE CUSTOMERS.
IT'S NEVER INSIDE.

07:20.732 --> 07:22.608
AND WE NEVER, EVER
LOOK OBJECTIVELY

07:22.608 --> 07:25.278
AND UNDERSTAND HOW BAD WE ARE.
RIGHT.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.238
BUT EVERYONE'S WALKING AROUND
IN DENIAL.

07:27.238 --> 07:29.699
IT WAS HARD TO HEAR.
UH-HUH.

07:29.699 --> 07:30.000
I'M NOT UPSET
BECAUSE I'M IN DENIAL.

07:30.000 --> 07:32.285
I'M NOT UPSET
BECAUSE I'M IN DENIAL.

07:32.285 --> 07:34.370
I'M JUST UPSET
BECAUSE THIS IS

07:34.370 --> 07:37.582
THE FIRST TIME
WE'VE ENCOUNTERED THIS.

07:37.582 --> 07:39.250
I'M NOT TRYING TO RUB
YOUR FACE IN IT...

07:39.250 --> 07:40.251
RIGHT.

07:40.251 --> 07:41.878
BUT TONIGHT, THREE TABLES

07:41.878 --> 07:44.130
STARTED COMPLAINING
ABOUT THE HUMMUS.

07:44.130 --> 07:47.175
I RAN 100 METERS UP THE ROAD.
I STORE-BOUGHT IT,

07:47.175 --> 07:49.343
CAME BACK THROUGH THE KITCHEN,
PRESENTED IT.

07:49.343 --> 07:51.262
THEY LOVED IT.

07:51.262 --> 07:53.222
I'M TRYING TO GET THAT MESSAGE
THROUGH TO YOUR AUNT.

07:53.222 --> 07:56.893
WHEN CUSTOMERS THINK THAT
A STORE-BOUGHT HUMMUS IS BETTER

07:56.893 --> 07:58.686
THAN WHAT
YOU JUST SERVED THEM

07:58.686 --> 08:00.000
AND CHARGED THEM
THREE TIMES THE MONEY,

08:00.000 --> 08:00.146
AND CHARGED THEM
THREE TIMES THE MONEY,

08:00.146 --> 08:02.190
THAT'S HOW FAR
WE'VE SLIPPED.

08:02.190 --> 08:03.191
<i>AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT?</i>

08:03.191 --> 08:05.860
IT'S SAD IN THERE.
IT IS SO SAD.

08:09.238 --> 08:12.033
<i>I'VE GOT A QUESTION FOR YOU.</i>
SURE.

08:12.033 --> 08:15.203
DEEP DOWN INSIDE,
FROM THE BOTTOM OF YOUR HEART,

08:15.203 --> 08:19.874
DO YOU WANT TO SERIOUSLY
CONTINUE RUNNING THIS BUSINESS?

08:19.874 --> 08:21.667
I DEFINITELY DO.
DO YOU?

08:21.667 --> 08:25.421
YES, I DO.
100%?

08:25.421 --> 08:26.464
OKAY.

08:26.464 --> 08:28.174
I'LL SEE YOU IN THE MORNING.
OKAY.

08:28.174 --> 08:30.000
GOOD NIGHT.

08:30.000 --> 08:31.177
GOOD NIGHT.

08:36.432 --> 08:38.017
MM.

08:38.017 --> 08:41.103
YOU'RE OKAY?

08:41.103 --> 08:43.481
EVERYTHING FOR THE BEST.

08:45.149 --> 08:46.150
OH, DON'T CRY.

08:46.150 --> 08:49.153
WE NEED TO MAKE IT BETTER.

09:01.541 --> 09:03.709
INSTEAD OF POINTING
THE FINGER,

09:03.709 --> 09:05.878
<i>CAN WE COME UP WITH A LIST</i>

09:05.878 --> 09:09.715
OF THINGS THAT YOU COULD DO
TO IMPROVE?

09:09.715 --> 09:11.050
I THINK THAT'S ACTUALLY
A REALLY GREAT IDEA.

09:11.050 --> 09:13.886
NO, I ACTUALLY WANT TO GO.
I'M REALLY TIRED.

09:13.886 --> 09:16.639
<i>I'M FRUSTRATED.</i>

09:16.639 --> 09:19.433
IN FAY'S MIND, SHE THINKS
THAT WE'RE THE PROBLEM

09:19.433 --> 09:21.727
AND THAT WE MAKE MISTAKES
AND THAT WE'RE THE ISSUE.

09:21.727 --> 09:24.272
BUT SHE'S THE CHEF,
SHE'S THE PREP.

09:24.272 --> 09:25.314
SHE DOES EVERYTHING.

09:25.314 --> 09:28.192
AND I BELIEVE 100%
THAT SHE WON'T CHANGE,

09:28.192 --> 09:29.735
AND THERE'S NO QUESTION
ABOUT IT.

09:29.735 --> 09:30.000
OKAY, EVERYBODY CLOCK OUT
AND GO HOME.

09:30.000 --> 09:32.655
OKAY, EVERYBODY CLOCK OUT
AND GO HOME.

09:32.655 --> 09:35.575
I'D LOVE TO FIX ALL THESE
PROBLEMS, BUT MY HANDS ARE TIED.

09:35.575 --> 09:37.076
FAY HAS TO TRUST ME

09:37.076 --> 09:40.788
AS A BUSINESS PARTNER
IN ORDER FOR THINGS TO CHANGE.

09:44.375 --> 09:47.086
COMING UP...
THIS IS CRAZY.

09:47.086 --> 09:48.296
THE FIGHTING INTENSIFIES.

09:48.296 --> 09:49.505
DID YOU EVER ASK ME?

09:49.505 --> 09:50.965
NO, BUT I'VE COME AND ASKED
TO HELP--

09:50.965 --> 09:52.300
I HAVE ASKED.

09:52.300 --> 09:53.676
AS THE STAFF REACHES
A BREAKING POINT...

09:53.676 --> 09:54.677
SHE'S THIS.

09:54.677 --> 09:56.470
ARE YOU  KIDDING ME?
WOW.

09:56.470 --> 09:57.972
AND FAY CONTINUES
TO HOLD HER GROUND.

09:57.972 --> 10:00.000
I EVEN TOLD YOU BRING
A DAMN PIECE OF PAPER AND A PEN

10:00.000 --> 10:01.184
I EVEN TOLD YOU BRING
A DAMN PIECE OF PAPER AND A PEN

10:01.184 --> 10:02.143
AND WRITE DOWN
WHAT I TELL YOU.

10:02.143 --> 10:03.853
ONE TIME TWO DAYS AGO,

10:03.853 --> 10:05.104
<i>THREE DAYS AGO!</i>
STOP. STOP, STOP, STOP, STOP.

10:05.104 --> 10:06.480
AND LATER...

10:06.480 --> 10:09.192
AMEL, YOU HAVE A  MOUTH
ON YOU THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

10:09.192 --> 10:11.527
CHEF RAMSAY MAKES
A DRASTIC DECISION.

10:11.527 --> 10:14.238
YOU...ARE GOING HOME.

10:26.457 --> 10:27.959
CHEF RAMSAY KNOWS THE ONLY WAY

10:27.959 --> 10:30.127
HE CAN MOVE FORWARD WITH FIXING
THE RESTAURANT...

10:30.127 --> 10:31.295
LET'S COME OUT OVER HERE.

10:31.295 --> 10:32.547
IS THAT HE FIRST MUST FIND
A WAY

10:32.547 --> 10:34.966
TO GET BRENDA AND FAY
ON THE SAME PAGE.

10:34.966 --> 10:36.884
HE BEGINS THE DAY
WITH A STAFF MEETING,

10:36.884 --> 10:39.136
WITH THE GOAL OF CLEARING
THE AIR.

10:39.136 --> 10:44.725
LAST NIGHT, I SAW YOU,
FAY, BURNT OUT,

10:44.725 --> 10:46.143
FEELING ALONE, ISOLATED,

10:46.143 --> 10:48.229
<i>AND YOU SAW NO LIGHT</i>
<i>AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL.</i>

10:48.229 --> 10:49.953
I UNDERSTAND HOW OFTEN YOU'RE
TELLING ME HOW HARD IT IS,

10:49.953 --> 10:50.982
I UNDERSTAND HOW OFTEN YOU'RE
TELLING ME HOW HARD IT IS,

10:50.982 --> 10:52.191
<i>AND YOU'RE ON YOUR OWN.</i>

10:52.191 --> 10:53.609
<i>I GET ALL THAT.</i>
<i>I GOT THAT YESTERDAY.</i>

10:53.609 --> 10:55.653
<i>BUT LAST NIGHT,</i>
<i>I WATCHED EVERYTHING.</i>

10:55.653 --> 11:00.700
<i>AND YOU WORK, TALK, AND PERFORM</i>
<i>LIKE SOMEONE THAT'S GIVEN UP.</i>

11:00.700 --> 11:02.076
LAST NIGHT,
I WENT INTO THE KITCHEN

11:02.076 --> 11:03.661
AND JUST TOOK A FEW NOTES.

11:03.661 --> 11:06.247
<i>THERE MUST BE</i>
<i>THREE TO FOUR WEEKS' WORTH</i>

11:06.247 --> 11:08.207
<i>OF PREP FROZEN SOLID IN THERE.</i>

11:08.207 --> 11:09.458
IT'S ALL FREEZER-BURNT.

11:09.458 --> 11:12.211
THAT'S SUPPOSED TO BE BEEF.
SURE.

11:12.211 --> 11:13.588
DO YOU KNOW IN THAT FREEZER

11:13.588 --> 11:17.508
THERE'S CONTAINERS STACKED
THIS HIGH FULL OF PREP?

11:17.508 --> 11:19.953
<i>YOU'VE PREPPED SO FAR</i>
<i>IN ADVANCE, IT'S FREEZER-BURNT.</i>

11:19.953 --> 11:21.137
<i>YOU'VE PREPPED SO FAR</i>
<i>IN ADVANCE, IT'S FREEZER-BURNT.</i>

11:21.137 --> 11:22.722
<i>THEN I LOOK AT THE</i>
<i>REFRIGERATION UNIT IN THERE,</i>

11:22.722 --> 11:24.724
AND IT IS BEDLAM.

11:24.724 --> 11:27.059
<i>THE FRESH STUFF</i>
<i>IS AT THE FRONT,</i>

11:27.059 --> 11:28.227
<i>AND THE OLD STUFF</i>
<i>IS AT THE BACK.</i>

11:32.273 --> 11:34.400
YOU DON'T--
THIS IS SO DIFFICULT.

11:34.400 --> 11:36.819
<i>I'M NOT GOING TO EMBARRASS YOU</i>
<i>AND BRING OUT</i>

11:36.819 --> 11:37.987
THE YELLOW
AND THE ROTTEN PARSLEY.

11:37.987 --> 11:39.238
OKAY.

11:39.238 --> 11:41.157
SO YOU KNOW WHAT'S IN THE BACK
OF THE FRIDGE?

11:41.157 --> 11:42.575
YES.

11:42.575 --> 11:44.201
<i>WELL, WHAT I WANT</i>
<i>TO TALK ABOUT</i>

11:44.201 --> 11:46.162
THIS MORNING IS,
WHY IS IT LIKE THAT?

11:46.162 --> 11:47.580
LACK OF HELP.
LACK OF--

11:47.580 --> 11:49.953
YOU'RE FREEZING IT
FOR THE LACK OF HELP?

11:49.953 --> 11:51.167
YOU'RE FREEZING IT
FOR THE LACK OF HELP?

11:51.167 --> 11:52.793
YES.

11:52.793 --> 11:54.086
<i>FAY, BEFORE I CAN GO</i>

11:54.086 --> 11:57.256
<i>ANY FURTHER FORWARD,</i>
<i>LET ME ASK YOU THIS.</i>

11:57.256 --> 12:00.176
DO YOU THINK THAT YOU'RE
THE ONLY ONE THAT'S ACTUALLY

12:00.176 --> 12:02.261
WORKING AND PREPPING
IN THIS RESTAURANT?

12:02.261 --> 12:05.431
YES.

12:05.431 --> 12:07.266
THEY CAN CALL ME A LIAR
IF THEY WANT TO.

12:07.266 --> 12:10.102
THEY COME HERE,
DO THEIR SHIFT.

12:10.102 --> 12:13.731
I FEEL LIKE THEY'RE HERE
TO MAKE THEIR TIPS AND LEAVE.

12:13.731 --> 12:14.982
<i>RIGHT.</i>

12:14.982 --> 12:16.484
<i>THAT'S HONEST TRUTH.</i>

12:16.484 --> 12:18.152
THAT'S HOW I FEEL ABOUT THEM.

12:18.152 --> 12:19.953
SO WHO WAS THE FIRST PERSON
THAT LITERALLY GAVE UP?

12:19.953 --> 12:21.238
SO WHO WAS THE FIRST PERSON
THAT LITERALLY GAVE UP?

12:21.238 --> 12:24.992
<i>YOUR SON?</i>
<i>YOUR NIECE?</i>

12:24.992 --> 12:28.245
BRENDA.

12:30.831 --> 12:32.166
BRENDA?

12:32.166 --> 12:34.293
<i>IS THAT TRUE?</i>

12:38.297 --> 12:40.591
YOU SIT THERE IN SILENCE.

12:40.591 --> 12:43.511
I SIT HERE IN SILENCE
BECAUSE I KNOW THE TRUTH.

12:45.137 --> 12:48.265
I KNOW THAT I'VE STEPPED UP
SO MANY TIMES.

12:48.265 --> 12:49.308
<i>I DO.</i>

12:49.308 --> 12:49.953
<i>BUT SHE HAS OTHER PEOPLE</i>

12:49.953 --> 12:50.643
<i>BUT SHE HAS OTHER PEOPLE</i>

12:50.643 --> 12:52.895
<i>WHO OFFER TO DO IT.</i>
<i>I TRY TO HELP, BUT--</i>

12:52.895 --> 12:56.399
I DON'T LIKE AMEL TO BE
IN THE KITCHEN BECAUSE SHE CRIES

12:56.399 --> 12:59.527
ABOUT EVERYTHING AND LITTLE
THING, AND SHE ALL DAY...

12:59.527 --> 13:00.569
- ALL DAY.
<i>- NO. NO.</i>

13:00.569 --> 13:01.862
<i>YES, SHE DID.</i>

13:01.862 --> 13:03.280
- BURNED HERSELF WITH HOT WATER.
<i>- ONCE.</i>

13:03.280 --> 13:04.782
POKED HERSELF WITH KNIFE.

13:04.782 --> 13:06.283
<i>EVEN CUTTING LEMON</i>
<i>FOR HER ICED TEA.</i>

13:06.283 --> 13:07.702
I HAVEN'T POKED MYSELF
WITH A KNIFE.

13:07.702 --> 13:10.746
SHE'S DENYING THIS RIGHT NOW

13:10.746 --> 13:12.289
<i>BECAUSE SHE DOESN'T--</i>
I'M NOT--

13:12.289 --> 13:13.499
<i>LET ME FINISH.</i>

13:13.499 --> 13:17.044
I FEEL RESPONSIBLE
FOR HER ASKING FOR BANDAGE

13:17.044 --> 13:18.504
<i>ALL THE TIME, AND I DON'T WANT</i>
<i>BLOOD IN THE FOOD.</i>

13:18.504 --> 13:19.953
I DON'T WANT
THE DRAMA ITSELF.

13:19.953 --> 13:22.174
I DON'T WANT
THE DRAMA ITSELF.

13:22.174 --> 13:25.553
AMEL COMPLAINS ABOUT BEING HERE
AFTER 9:00.

13:25.553 --> 13:28.139
SHE GIVE ME AN ATTITUDE FACE.

13:28.139 --> 13:29.765
IT WAS 10:30 AT N--
<i>BUT IT WAS HER TIME</i>

13:29.765 --> 13:32.977
TO GO OUT WITH HER BOYFRIEND
WAITING FOR HER OUTSIDE.

13:32.977 --> 13:35.187
SHE'S THIS.
ONLY TALK.

13:35.187 --> 13:37.606
NOT--NOT DO.
RIGHT.

13:37.606 --> 13:39.108
<i>AND WHEN I SAY THAT TO HER,</i>

13:39.108 --> 13:40.568
SHE TAKE IT AS I'M MEAN,

13:40.568 --> 13:43.904
I'M THE BIGGEST "B"
THAT SHE EVER SEEN.

13:43.904 --> 13:45.197
DO YOU TRUST HER?

13:45.197 --> 13:47.241
I-I DO.

13:47.241 --> 13:48.909
SHE'S AMAZING HELP.

13:48.909 --> 13:49.953
SHE JUST SAID SHE DOESN'T.
<i>SHE'S A VERY GOOD WORKER.</i>

13:49.953 --> 13:51.203
SHE JUST SAID SHE DOESN'T.
<i>SHE'S A VERY GOOD WORKER.</i>

13:51.203 --> 13:52.163
I'M CONFUSED.

13:52.163 --> 13:53.330
"I TRUST HER,
BUT I DON'T TRUST HER."

13:53.330 --> 13:55.666
<i>DOES SHE NOT WELCOME HELP?</i>

13:55.666 --> 13:57.835
OH, NOT FROM ME WHATSOEVER.

13:57.835 --> 14:00.087
I THINK WHEN SHE'S DRAINED,
SHE ACCEPTS THE HELP.

14:00.087 --> 14:03.716
BUT SHE HAS TO REACH
THAT LEVEL.

14:03.716 --> 14:05.009
CAN I SAY WHY?

14:05.009 --> 14:07.136
<i>WHY I DO THAT?</i>
GO AHEAD.

14:07.136 --> 14:08.345
I HEAR COMPLAINT FROM BRENDA
ALL THE TIME

14:08.345 --> 14:10.639
<i>BECAUSE SHE WANTS OFF.</i>

14:10.639 --> 14:11.849
<i>SHE NEEDS HER TIME OFF.</i>

14:11.849 --> 14:13.851
THAT'S NOT
WHAT BRENDA'S SAYING.

14:13.851 --> 14:15.144
LOOK AT BRENDA.

14:15.144 --> 14:19.774
FAY, I TELL YOU WHEN I HAVE
A FAMILY EVENT TO GO TO,

14:19.774 --> 14:19.953
<i>AND I SLIP OUT OF HERE</i>
<i>FOR AN EXTRA DAY,</i>

14:19.953 --> 14:22.151
<i>AND I SLIP OUT OF HERE</i>
<i>FOR AN EXTRA DAY,</i>

14:22.151 --> 14:24.320
- I FEEL GUILTY.
<i>- I KNOW YOU'VE SAID THAT.</i>

14:24.320 --> 14:26.113
AND I'VE EXPRESSED THAT TO YOU
SO MANY TIMES.

14:26.113 --> 14:27.448
- I DID.
<i>- I FEEL GUILTY.</i>

14:27.448 --> 14:29.158
I TELL YOU WHY.
I DON'T LIKE TAKING TIME OFF.

14:29.158 --> 14:30.826
I TELL YOU WHY.
AND IT'S BECAUSE--

14:30.826 --> 14:32.661
<i>I TELL YOU WHY,</i>
<i>AND I WANTED YOU TO HAVE</i>

14:32.661 --> 14:34.663
FUN AND ENJOY FAMILY
WHEN YOU'RE OUT OF HERE.

14:34.663 --> 14:36.874
EXACTLY.
SO YOU DON'T COME
WITH THAT BURDEN

14:36.874 --> 14:39.210
AND THAT LOOK AGAIN
LIKE YOU DON'T WANT TO BE HERE.

14:39.210 --> 14:42.087
AND I DON'T WANT YOU TO HAVE
THAT SAME LOOK EITHER, FAY.

14:43.756 --> 14:48.135
HOW MANY TIMES--NO.
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I TOLD YOU--

14:48.135 --> 14:49.345
<i>FAY, WAIT A MINUTE.</i>
EVERYBODY'S FREE.

14:49.345 --> 14:49.953
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I ASKED YOU,

14:49.953 --> 14:51.180
HOW MANY TIMES HAVE I ASKED YOU,

14:51.180 --> 14:56.060
"PLEASE TAKE AN EXTRA TIME OFF.
GO HOME FOR A FEW DAYS."

14:56.060 --> 14:57.269
AND I DO!

14:57.269 --> 14:59.396
I DO ANYTHING
THAT YOU ASK ME TO DO.

14:59.396 --> 15:01.232
<i>YOU TELL ME TO ROAST</i>
<i>THE EGGPLANT AND PEEL IT, I DO.</i>

15:01.232 --> 15:02.274
"ASK."
"ASK."

15:02.274 --> 15:05.820
BECAUSE UNLESS I ASK YOU
TO PLEASE LET ME DO SOMETHING,

15:05.820 --> 15:07.279
LET ME HELP YOU OUT,

15:07.279 --> 15:08.531
<i>UNLESS I DO,</i>
<i>YOU DON'T TELL ME,</i>

15:08.531 --> 15:09.532
<i>"HEY, COME BACK HERE</i>
<i>AND HELP ME."</i>

15:09.532 --> 15:10.533
I MAKE A LIST.

15:10.533 --> 15:12.117
HOW MANY TIMES?
<i>AND I LEAVE IT,</i>

15:12.117 --> 15:13.953
90% OF THE TIME,
I END UP WITH--

15:13.953 --> 15:15.663
90%--99% OF THE TIME,
IT'S DONE!

15:15.663 --> 15:17.957
<i>WHEN I HAVE LUNCH</i>
<i>AND I HAVE TO SERVE.</i>

15:17.957 --> 15:19.953
<i>NO, 99% OF THE TIME, IT'S DONE.</i>
HONEST TO GOD.

15:19.953 --> 15:20.000
<i>NO, 99% OF THE TIME, IT'S DONE.</i>
HONEST TO GOD.

15:20.000 --> 15:23.546
AND IF IT'S NOT DONE, IT'S
BECAUSE I WAS BUSY ON THE LINE.

15:23.546 --> 15:25.923
<i>THAT'S THE ONLY TIME</i>
<i>STUFF DOESN'T GET DONE.</i>

15:25.923 --> 15:29.051
I HAVE MANY TIMES
WALKED IN THE BACK, SHE SAYS,

15:29.051 --> 15:31.262
"I HAVE A LOT OF PREPARATION."
"WHAT CAN I HELP WITH?"

15:31.262 --> 15:32.638
I'LL PUT FRICKIN' GLOVES ON,

15:32.638 --> 15:35.474
AND I'LL PULL OUT
A CUTTING BOARD AND A KNIFE.

15:35.474 --> 15:37.601
"TELL ME HOW TO DO IT.
SHOW ME HOW TO DO IT."

15:37.601 --> 15:38.727
UNTIL WE GET A PHONE CALL

15:38.727 --> 15:40.145
AND WE LEAVE THE KITCHEN,
NEVER COME BACK.

15:40.145 --> 15:41.146
I AM SO CONFUSED.
THEY'RE SAYING--

15:41.146 --> 15:42.273
<i>BUT I AM!</i>

15:42.273 --> 15:45.734
I GO THROUGH THE SAME STUFF
YOU DO.

15:45.734 --> 15:47.820
I MEAN, I'M NOT SITTING HERE,

15:47.820 --> 15:49.953
FRICKING LEG OVER LEG,
DOING NOTHING.

15:49.953 --> 15:50.364
FRICKING LEG OVER LEG,
DOING NOTHING.

15:50.364 --> 15:53.200
SO WHY DOES FAY HAVE TO PREP
FOR YOU WHEN IT'S HER DAY OFF?

15:53.200 --> 15:56.370
BECAUSE SHE FEELS THAT SHE NEEDS
TO SEASON THINGS,

15:56.370 --> 15:58.080
THAT SHE NEEDS TO CUT THINGS,
AND IT HAS TO BE DONE BY HER.

15:58.080 --> 15:59.582
<i>WHY, THOUGH?</i>

15:59.582 --> 16:01.458
<i>YOU'RE COOKING THEM.</i>
<i>YOU'RE COOKING THEM.</i>

16:01.458 --> 16:04.378
IT'S LIKE, YOU CAN'T TRUST
YOUR FAMILY, WHO CAN YOU TRUST?

16:04.378 --> 16:05.880
IT'S NOT A POINT OF TRUST.

16:05.880 --> 16:08.424
IT'S A POINT OF EVERYONE,
THEY WANT THEIR TIME OFF.

16:08.424 --> 16:10.551
SO THEY DON'T WANT TO BE HERE
AS MUCH AS YOU DO.

16:10.551 --> 16:13.596
IT'S NOT--
<i>EVEN YOUR 50% PARTNER.</i>

16:13.596 --> 16:15.014
YES.

16:15.014 --> 16:16.765
- WOW. WOW.
<i>- THAT'S NOT TRUE.</i>

16:16.765 --> 16:18.392
THAT IS SO NOT TRUE.

16:18.392 --> 16:19.852
<i>THAT'S TRUE.</i>

16:19.852 --> 16:19.953
MAYBE EVERYBODY'S ASSUMING,

16:19.953 --> 16:23.022
MAYBE EVERYBODY'S ASSUMING,

16:23.022 --> 16:25.190
ASSUMING THAT I DON'T WANT
TO BE HERE

16:25.190 --> 16:27.943
<i>OR SHE DOESN'T WANT TO BE HERE,</i>
<i>NOBODY WANTS TO BE HERE.</i>

16:27.943 --> 16:29.570
IT'S NOT VOICED.

16:29.570 --> 16:30.821
RIGHT.
<i>NOTHING'S VOICED.</i>

16:30.821 --> 16:32.156
THERE'S POOR COMMUNICATION.

16:32.156 --> 16:33.866
I CAN SEE THAT.

16:33.866 --> 16:35.993
<i>THIS IS CRAZY.</i>

16:35.993 --> 16:37.703
ANY OF YOU, ANY OF YOU,
SHOWED UP

16:37.703 --> 16:41.123
AN HOUR EARLIER JUST TO GET
YOUR--EVEN YOUR OWN THING GOING?

16:41.123 --> 16:43.626
I SHOW UP EARLY A LOT,
ACTUALLY.

16:43.626 --> 16:45.336
<i>I NEVER--</i>
I HAVE YOUR TIME CARD.

16:45.336 --> 16:46.545
OKAY, YOU HAVE MY TIME CARD--
THEN YOU KNOW

16:46.545 --> 16:47.922
I'M AT LEAST
10 TO 20 MINUTES EARLY--

16:47.922 --> 16:49.953
YOU'RE NEVER HERE 20, 30, 40,
ONE HOUR EARLY.

16:49.953 --> 16:51.133
YOU'RE NEVER HERE 20, 30, 40,
ONE HOUR EARLY.

16:51.133 --> 16:53.135
BECAUSE I DON'T NEED
TO BE HERE AN HOUR EARLY

16:53.135 --> 16:55.220
BECAUSE I NEED TO TAKE CARE
OF MY DINING ROOM.

16:55.220 --> 16:57.222
THAT IS THE JOB
THAT YOU HAVE GIVEN ME, SO I DO.

16:57.222 --> 16:58.265
DID YOU HEAR THAT?

16:58.265 --> 16:59.099
SHE TAKE CARE
OF HER DINING ROOM,

16:59.099 --> 17:01.936
WHICH LOOKS LIKE THIS
ALL THE TIME.

17:01.936 --> 17:03.354
<i>WHY DO YOU FEEL</i>
<i>SO UNCOMFORTABLE</i>

17:03.354 --> 17:05.814
<i>THAT THE NIGHT</i>
<i>BEFORE YOU TAKE YOUR DAY OFF,</i>

17:05.814 --> 17:09.234
YOU HAVE TO CONTROL THEM
WITH EVERYTHING THAT YOU DO?

17:09.234 --> 17:10.486
WHY HAS IT GOT THAT BAD?

17:10.486 --> 17:12.154
NOBODY STEPPED IN.

17:12.154 --> 17:13.322
<i>NOBODY STEPPED IN?</i>
<i>EVEN WHEN THEY WOULD ASK.</i>

17:13.322 --> 17:15.074
SHE WON'T LET US!
BRENDA--

17:15.074 --> 17:16.742
<i>BRENDA'S OFFERED,</i>
<i>EVERYBODY'S OFFERED,</i>

17:16.742 --> 17:19.078
AND SHE WON'T TEACH ANYBODY
BECAUSE SHE WANTS TO DO IT.

17:19.078 --> 17:19.953
WHEN SHE COMPLAINS
AND STUFF LIKE THAT,

17:19.953 --> 17:20.537
WHEN SHE COMPLAINS
AND STUFF LIKE THAT,

17:20.537 --> 17:23.082
SHE DOESN'T ALLOW ANYBODY
TO DO ANYTHING!

17:23.082 --> 17:25.125
I EVEN TOLD YOU
BRING A DAMN PIECE OF PAPER

17:25.125 --> 17:26.669
AND A PEN AND WRITE DOWN
WHAT I TELL YOU!

17:26.669 --> 17:29.254
ONE TIME, TWO DAYS AGO,
THREE DAYS AGO!

17:29.254 --> 17:31.548
ARE YOU  KIDDING ME?

17:31.548 --> 17:34.134
DON'T EVER USE THAT WORD
WITH ME, EVER!

17:34.134 --> 17:35.344
I MEAN IT.

17:35.344 --> 17:38.806
<i>DO NOT EVER USE</i>
<i>THIS LANGUAGE WITH ME.</i>

17:38.806 --> 17:40.057
IT'S ALL ABOUT MY LANGUAGE,
BUT YOU'RE NOT LISTENING

17:40.057 --> 17:41.058
TO WHAT I'M TRYING
TO SAY BEHIND IT.

17:41.058 --> 17:42.601
<i>NO, I'M TRYING.</i>

17:42.601 --> 17:45.938
FOR THE LAST FOUR, FIVE,
SEVEN YEARS YOU WERE HERE,

17:45.938 --> 17:48.732
DID YOU EVER ASK ME TO COME
AND WRITE THINGS DOWN?

17:48.732 --> 17:49.775
NO, BUT I'VE COME AND ASKED
TO HELP IN THE KITCHEN.

17:49.775 --> 17:49.953
THAT'S IT.
THAT'S A NO.

17:49.953 --> 17:50.776
THAT'S IT.
THAT'S A NO.

17:50.776 --> 17:51.777
YOU CAN ASK HER.

17:51.777 --> 17:53.654
I'VE ASKED--
<i>WHEN YOU ASKED,</i>

17:53.654 --> 17:56.156
I TOLD YOU TO COME AND BRING
A PIECE OF PAPER AND PEN

17:56.156 --> 17:57.408
<i>AND WRITE EXACTLY</i>
<i>WHAT I'M DOING.</i>

17:57.408 --> 17:58.909
NO, YOU DIDN'T,
YOU TOLD ME THAT THREE DAYS AGO

17:58.909 --> 17:59.910
WHEN WE WERE MAKING SALMON.

17:59.910 --> 18:00.995
THAT WAS THE ONLY  TIME

18:00.995 --> 18:02.246
YOU'VE EVER SAID
ANYTHING LIKE THAT.

18:02.246 --> 18:03.956
<i>THAT WAS NOT THE ONLY TIME...</i>
<i>WHATEVER.</i>

18:03.956 --> 18:06.125
AND I TOLD YOU DO NOT USE
THAT LANGUAGE WITH ME

18:06.125 --> 18:07.376
<i>FOR THE SECOND TIME.</i>
WHATEVER.

18:07.376 --> 18:09.211
I'VE OFFERED SO MANY TIMES.

18:09.211 --> 18:10.212
YOU'VE BEEN HERE FOR YEARS.

18:10.212 --> 18:11.338
IF YOU WERE SO SMART,

18:11.338 --> 18:13.549
WHY YOU DIDN'T COME NEXT
TO ME ONE DAY AND SAID,

18:13.549 --> 18:14.925
<i>"YOU KNOW WHAT?</i>
<i>I LIKE WHAT YOU'RE DOING..."</i>

18:14.925 --> 18:16.051
I DID, I STAND IN THE KITCHEN
AND WATCH YOU CUT MEAT...

18:16.051 --> 18:17.094
<i>"WOULD YOU PLEASE TEACH ME?"</i>

18:17.094 --> 18:18.095
AND YOU TELL ME TO SHUT UP
AND GET OUT.

18:18.095 --> 18:19.096
NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE.
THAT'S A LIE.

18:19.096 --> 18:19.953
OKAY.

18:19.953 --> 18:21.098
OKAY.

18:27.270 --> 18:28.646
WHAT STARTED OUT
AS A STAFF MEETING

18:28.646 --> 18:29.939
TO CLEAR THE AIR...

18:29.939 --> 18:31.983
I GO THROUGH
THE SAME STUFF YOU DO!

18:31.983 --> 18:34.235
HAS ERUPTED
INTO A SCREAMING MATCH

18:34.235 --> 18:35.987
BETWEEN FAY AND THE STAFF...

18:35.987 --> 18:38.948
I EVEN TOLD YOU BRING
A DAMN PIECE OF PAPER AND A PEN

18:38.948 --> 18:40.116
AND WRITE DOWN
WHAT I TELL YOU.

18:40.116 --> 18:41.534
ONE TIME, TWO DAYS AGO!

18:41.534 --> 18:43.161
<i>ARE YOU  KIDDING ME?</i>

18:43.161 --> 18:44.329
WITH FAY HOLDING ON

18:44.329 --> 18:46.247
TO HER BELIEF THAT NO ONE
IS COMMITTED...

18:46.247 --> 18:47.665
SO THEY DON'T WANT TO BE HERE
AS MUCH AS YOU DO?

18:47.665 --> 18:49.167
YES.
WOW.

18:49.167 --> 18:51.002
AND THE STAFF HOLDING ON
TO THEIR BELIEF...

18:51.002 --> 18:53.546
NOBODY WANTS TO HELP HER
BECAUSE SHE'S SO CRITICAL

18:53.546 --> 18:53.936
OF THE WAY YOU DO HELP HER!

18:53.936 --> 18:55.256
OF THE WAY YOU DO HELP HER!

18:55.256 --> 18:59.469
THAT FAY IS ACTUALLY UNWILLING
TO ACCEPT HELP FROM ANYONE.

18:59.469 --> 19:01.054
OKAY, STOP.
STOP, STOP, STOP, STOP, STOP.

19:01.054 --> 19:02.221
DON'T YOU WANT
TO BE CONSISTENT?

19:02.221 --> 19:03.681
YEAH, OF COURSE.
YEAH, NATURALLY.

19:03.681 --> 19:05.808
BUT WHAT IS IT THAT YOU
STRUGGLE WITH TO TEACH THEM?

19:05.808 --> 19:07.310
I TRY.

19:07.310 --> 19:08.728
OH, NO, I DON'T THINK
YOU'RE TRYING ENOUGH.

19:08.728 --> 19:10.897
SHE DOESN'T HAVE THE PATIENCE
TO TRAIN SOMEBODY.

19:10.897 --> 19:13.900
IF SHE DOES, SHE'LL SHOW YOU,
AND THEN SHE'LL SAY, "DO IT."

19:13.900 --> 19:16.110
AND THEN IF YOU DO IT, AND IT'S
NOT PERFECT THE WAY SHE WANTS,

19:16.110 --> 19:18.279
SHE'LL GET SO FRUSTRATED,
AND SHE'LL YELL AT YOU

19:18.279 --> 19:19.447
TO THE POINT WHERE IT'S JUST--

19:19.447 --> 19:21.324
YOU FEEL OVERWHELMED
YOURSELF, AND--

19:21.324 --> 19:23.326
DID I EVER DO THAT WITH YOU?
YES.

19:23.326 --> 19:23.936
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

19:23.936 --> 19:24.827
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

19:24.827 --> 19:26.412
MARK, IS THAT TRUE?

19:26.412 --> 19:30.458
SHE HAS A HARD TIME
TRUSTING PEOPLE.

19:30.458 --> 19:35.755
FAY TOLD ME YESTERDAY,
IF YOU WERE NOT FAMILY,

19:35.755 --> 19:39.509
ONE, TWO, THREE, FOUR OF YOU
WOULD BE  FIRED.

19:40.718 --> 19:43.096
<i>NOW...</i>
YES.

19:43.096 --> 19:45.556
WHY CAN'T YOU TRUST THEM
TO RUN THIS BUSINESS?

19:45.556 --> 19:48.393
I CAN.

19:48.393 --> 19:49.394
- YOU CAN?
<i>- I CAN.</i>

19:49.394 --> 19:50.520
<i>OKAY, PROVE IT, PROVE IT.</i>

19:50.520 --> 19:52.355
NO, YOU NEED TO PROVE
THAT YOU HAVE THE TRUST.

19:52.355 --> 19:53.936
I NEED TO WALK OUT
OF ONE, I--OKAY.

19:53.936 --> 19:54.691
I NEED TO WALK OUT
OF ONE, I--OKAY.

19:54.691 --> 19:56.192
I'M GONNA AGREE TO SOMETHING.

19:56.192 --> 19:59.195
I'M GONNA LEAVE EVERYTHING
NOT DONE THE NIGHT BEFORE.

19:59.195 --> 20:02.490
NOT DONE?
AND YOU WALK HERE, AND YOU ASK

20:02.490 --> 20:04.867
TO BE SERVED FOOD
AND SEE WHAT YOU'RE GONNA GET.

20:04.867 --> 20:07.537
STOP THERE.
DO YOU KNOW WHAT?

20:07.537 --> 20:11.374
IT.
WE'RE GONNA OPEN FOR LUNCH.

20:11.374 --> 20:14.544
I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU AND YOU
BEHIND THE LINE.

20:14.544 --> 20:16.713
<i>I'D LIKE TO SEE YOU AND YOU</i>
<i>IN THE DINING ROOM.</i>

20:16.713 --> 20:21.259
AND YOU ARE GOING HOME.

20:21.259 --> 20:22.969
OKAY.
<i>OKAY?</i>

20:22.969 --> 20:23.936
AND I WILL GIVE YOU FEEDBACK
ON HOW IT WENT.

20:23.936 --> 20:25.346
AND I WILL GIVE YOU FEEDBACK
ON HOW IT WENT.

20:25.346 --> 20:27.473
<i>YOU'VE GOT 15 MINUTES.</i>
<i>LET'S GO.</i>

20:27.473 --> 20:29.809
15 MINUTES.
YOU HAPPY WITH THAT?

20:29.809 --> 20:30.810
YES.
LET'S GO.

20:30.810 --> 20:32.812
AH!

20:32.812 --> 20:34.355
I KNOW I CAN DO THIS
WITHOUT FAY,

20:34.355 --> 20:35.773
AND I WOULD LOVE
FOR HER TO SEE

20:35.773 --> 20:38.526
THAT I AM CAPABLE OF DOING THIS,
AND I CAN RUN THE SHOW.

20:40.903 --> 20:42.572
YEAH!

20:42.572 --> 20:44.115
YOU OKAY?
I'M OKAY.

20:44.115 --> 20:45.575
YOU SURE?
YES.

20:45.575 --> 20:47.410
THIS IS HARD FOR YOU.
VERY.

20:47.410 --> 20:48.411
YEAH?

20:48.411 --> 20:49.412
TODAY IS GOING TO BE DISASTER.

20:49.412 --> 20:51.456
I DON'T FEEL LIKE IT GOES

20:51.456 --> 20:53.791
THE WAY IT'S SUPPOSED TO GO
WHEN I'M NOT HERE.

20:53.791 --> 20:53.936
NOW, I WANT YOU TO JUMP
IN HERE.

20:53.936 --> 20:55.835
NOW, I WANT YOU TO JUMP
IN HERE.

20:55.835 --> 20:57.045
YEAH?

20:57.045 --> 20:59.213
THEY'RE GONNA STRUGGLE
WITHOUT ME.

20:59.213 --> 21:00.339
I HAVE A CONFESSION
FOR YOU.

21:00.339 --> 21:02.175
YOU'RE NOT GOING HOME
REALLY.

21:02.175 --> 21:05.928
I'D LIKE YOU TO SIT IN HERE
AND WATCH CAREFULLY,

21:05.928 --> 21:08.181
BECAUSE I DON'T THINK
YOU REALLY KNOW

21:08.181 --> 21:10.641
WHAT GOES ON IN YOUR RESTAURANT
WHEN YOU'RE NOT THERE.

21:10.641 --> 21:11.642
<i>MM-HMM?</i>
OKAY.

21:11.642 --> 21:14.145
LISTEN CAREFULLY.

PAY CLOSE ATTENTION
TO EVERYTHING YOU SEE.

21:17.273 --> 21:18.399
OKAY.
OKAY, GOOD.

21:26.574 --> 21:28.326
NO.

23:46.964 --> 23:48.090
GO DO SOMETHING ELSE.

23:48.090 --> 23:49.383
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT TURKISH COFFEE.

23:49.383 --> 23:50.968
I'LL GET IT DONE FOR YOU.
WE HEARD YOU, THANK YOU.

23:50.968 --> 23:52.386
<i>WHEN IT'S READY,</i>
<i>I'LL PUT IT ON THE COUNTER.</i>

23:52.386 --> 23:53.936
WE HEAR YOU, THANK YOU.

23:53.936 --> 23:54.013
WE HEAR YOU, THANK YOU.

23:54.013 --> 23:56.307
AMEL, YOU HAVE A  MOUTH
ON YOU THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

23:56.307 --> 23:59.393
HEY, MARK.
WATCH YOUR MOUTH, RELAX.

23:59.393 --> 24:00.269
SO I CAN'T--
SHUT UP.

24:00.269 --> 24:01.270
MARK--
GO, GO.

24:01.270 --> 24:02.605
<i>WATCH IT.</i>

24:02.605 --> 24:03.606
<i>DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT.</i>
<i>GO!</i>

24:03.606 --> 24:04.732
COME ON, YOU GUYS.

24:04.732 --> 24:06.734
GO!

24:14.866 --> 24:16.284
WITHOUT THE STAFF'S KNOWLEDGE,

24:16.284 --> 24:17.994
CHEF RAMSAY IS ATTEMPTING
TO SHOW FAY

24:17.994 --> 24:20.038
THAT THE RESTAURANT
CAN RUN WITHOUT HER.

24:20.038 --> 24:21.706
I DON'T THINK
YOU REALLY KNOW

24:21.706 --> 24:23.916
WHAT GOES ON IN YOUR RESTAURANT
WHEN YOU'RE NOT THERE.

24:23.916 --> 24:25.543
HE HAS SET UP
A STAKE-OUT VEHICLE

24:25.543 --> 24:27.170
FOR HER TO OBSERVE.

24:27.170 --> 24:29.631
AMEL, YOU HAVE A  MOUTH
ON YOU THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE.

24:29.631 --> 24:32.634
- OH, MY GOD.
- AND ALTHOUGH BRENDA

24:32.634 --> 24:34.969
SEEMS TO HAVE A FIRM GRIP
ON RUNNING THE KITCHEN...

24:34.969 --> 24:35.970
ARE THOSE POTATOES READY?

24:35.970 --> 24:36.971
IT NEEDS TO GO OUT
WITH THIS ORDER.

24:36.971 --> 24:38.514
YEP, POTATOES READY.
ALL RIGHT.

24:38.514 --> 24:40.683
MARK AND AMEL HAVE STARTED
TO BICKER AT EACH OTHER.

24:40.683 --> 24:40.991
MOVE THAT.

24:40.991 --> 24:41.976
MOVE THAT.

24:41.976 --> 24:43.728
<i>I DON'T--SO I CAN'T--</i>
<i>SHUT UP.</i>

24:43.728 --> 24:44.729
MARK--
GO, GO.

24:44.729 --> 24:46.064
<i>WATCH IT.</i>

24:46.064 --> 24:47.231
<i>DON'T TALK TO ME LIKE THAT.</i>
GO!

24:47.231 --> 24:49.734
COME ON, YOU GUYS.

24:49.734 --> 24:51.319
YOU OKAY?
YES.

24:51.319 --> 24:53.196
I SWEAR TO GOD, I'M GONNA SHOVE
MY FOOT STRAIGHT UP HIS.

24:53.196 --> 24:54.280
WHO?
MARK.

24:54.280 --> 24:57.200
UH-OH.

24:57.200 --> 24:58.493
SARCASM NEEDS TO STOP.

24:58.493 --> 25:01.204
WELL, TALK--
IT'S CALLED COMMUNICATION.

25:01.204 --> 25:03.331
BRENDA'S GETTING STRAIGHT
TO THE POINT WITH AMEL.

25:03.331 --> 25:05.041
<i>THIS IS REALLY HARD FOR ME.</i>

25:05.041 --> 25:06.834
WHY IS IT HARD?
<i>BECAUSE I PUT MORE DEDICATION</i>

25:06.834 --> 25:08.378
AND MORE LOVE INTO THIS...
LISTEN TO ME.

25:08.378 --> 25:09.879
AND THEN MARK IS GONNA YELL
AT ME AND TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

25:09.879 --> 25:10.991
HE'S NOT YELLING AT YOU.
HE WAS.

25:10.991 --> 25:11.255
HE'S NOT YELLING AT YOU.
HE WAS.

25:11.255 --> 25:12.256
HE'S COMM--
ARE YOU KIDDING?

25:12.256 --> 25:13.549
<i>I HAD PARSLEY IN MY HAND.</i>
<i>LOOK--</i>

25:13.549 --> 25:15.009
I WAS SPRINKLING IT ON.
YOU CANNOT--

25:15.009 --> 25:16.010
I TOLD HIM I WAS GONNA TAKE IT.
CAN YOU STOP FOR A SECOND?

25:16.010 --> 25:17.762
AMEL GETS VERY FRUSTRATED

25:17.762 --> 25:20.306
WHEN SOMEONE'S TRYING
TO CORRECT HER.

25:20.306 --> 25:21.224
NO, I KNOW,
BUT LOOK AT THE WAY

25:21.224 --> 25:22.850
BRENDA'S CONTROLLING
THE SITUATION.

25:22.850 --> 25:25.520
WHEN MARK DOES THAT TO US--
CAN YOU STOP AND LISTEN TO ME?

25:25.520 --> 25:27.605
<i>OKAY.</i>
<i>WHEN SOMETHING SITS</i>
<i>ON THE COUNTER,</i>

25:27.605 --> 25:29.357
IT NEEDS
TO GO OUT QUICKLY.

25:29.357 --> 25:31.317
SEE, BRENDA CAN DO IT.
LOOK HOW TOUGH.

25:31.317 --> 25:34.696
HE ASKED YOU WHAT TABLE,
SO IT CAN GO OUT HOT AND FRESH.

25:34.696 --> 25:38.658
THAT'S BRENDA SHOWING THAT
SHE'S CAPABLE OF BEING A BOSS.

25:38.658 --> 25:40.576
HE IS HERE TO HELP YOU.

25:40.576 --> 25:40.991
BRENDA SEEMS TO BE
IN CHARGE NOW.

25:40.991 --> 25:44.038
BRENDA SEEMS TO BE
IN CHARGE NOW.

25:44.038 --> 25:45.081
I'M PROUD OF HER.

25:45.081 --> 25:47.041
DO YOU WANT TO CONTINUE
TO ARGUE?

25:49.627 --> 25:52.088
ALL RIGHT.
I'M GONNA START DISHING.

25:52.088 --> 25:53.589
<i>MARK, LET ME KNOW WHAT'S READY,</i>
<i>SO WE CAN START DISHING.</i>

25:53.589 --> 25:56.175
CHICKEN'S ALMOST READY.
BEEF SHAWARMA'S ALMOST READY.

25:56.175 --> 25:58.428
<i>START DISHING, BRENDA.</i>

25:58.428 --> 26:00.930
<i>TABLE FIVE, READY?</i>

26:02.515 --> 26:04.225
SO I HAVE YOUR ORDER
ALL SET.

26:04.225 --> 26:06.060
GOOD JOB.

26:06.060 --> 26:08.146
GOOD JOB, GUYS.

26:08.146 --> 26:09.397
<i>YOU READY?</i>

26:09.397 --> 26:10.991
WE'LL HAVE A LITTLE FUN
WITH THEM NOW, OKAY?

26:10.991 --> 26:12.233
WE'LL HAVE A LITTLE FUN
WITH THEM NOW, OKAY?

26:12.233 --> 26:13.609
AND THEN YOU CAN TELL THEM
HOW PROUD YOU ARE.

26:13.609 --> 26:14.861
<i>LAST TABLE GONE?</i>
YES.

26:14.861 --> 26:19.282
YEAH? GOOD.
COME OVER HERE, GUYS, PLEASE.

26:19.282 --> 26:20.742
SO WHY DON'T YOU JUST

26:20.742 --> 26:23.411
GIVE FAY A LITTLE INSIGHT
HOW IT WENT?

26:23.411 --> 26:26.664
I THOUGHT THE HEAT WAS ON
FOR QUITE A FEW MINUTES

26:26.664 --> 26:28.332
<i>JUST BECAUSE WE GOT SLAMMED</i>
<i>WITH ORDERS.</i>

26:28.332 --> 26:30.293
BUT WITH THE COMMUNICATION
WITH ME AND MARK

26:30.293 --> 26:32.587
<i>TAG-TEAMING ON THE GRILL</i>

26:32.587 --> 26:34.130
AND JUST COMMUNICATING
ACROSS THE BOARD--

26:34.130 --> 26:38.009
ONE OR TWO PLATES CAME BACK,
BUT WHEN WE PUT IT BACK OUT,

26:38.009 --> 26:39.010
NOT ONE COMPLAINT.

26:39.010 --> 26:40.178
I HAVE A CONFESSION
TO MAKE.

26:40.178 --> 26:40.991
<i>FAY DID NOT GO HOME.</i>

26:40.991 --> 26:44.182
<i>FAY DID NOT GO HOME.</i>

26:44.182 --> 26:45.516
SHE WAS WITH YOU
BECAUSE SHE WAS--

26:45.516 --> 26:48.895
SAT BEHIND THE RESTAURANT
IN THE CAR PARK,

26:48.895 --> 26:50.188
WATCHING EVERYTHING YOU DID,

26:50.188 --> 26:53.566
<i>LISTENING TO EVERYTHING</i>
<i>YOU SAID ON A MONITOR.</i>

26:53.566 --> 26:57.653
AND I THINK SHE HAS SOMETHING
SHE'D LIKE TO SAY TO YOU ALL.

26:57.653 --> 26:59.447
I'M REALLY PROUD
OF YOU ALL.

26:59.447 --> 27:02.200
THERE IS A FEW MISTAKES
THAT WE CAN WORK ON AND--

27:02.200 --> 27:03.576
<i>WHAT DID YOU THINK</i>
<i>OF BRENDA'S PERFORMANCE?</i>

27:03.576 --> 27:06.370
AMAZING.
YOU'RE AMAZING.

27:06.370 --> 27:08.206
<i>AND I FEEL LIKE</i>
<i>I DON'T TELL YOU ENOUGH.</i>

27:08.206 --> 27:10.458
IT'S AN EYE-OPENER FOR ME,
WHAT I SAW TODAY,

27:10.458 --> 27:10.991
<i>TO SEE HOW HARD YOU WORK,</i>

27:10.991 --> 27:11.959
<i>TO SEE HOW HARD YOU WORK,</i>

27:11.959 --> 27:14.629
<i>AND I COMMEND YOU</i>
<i>FOR TAKING CHARGE.</i>

27:14.629 --> 27:17.131
<i>AND I DID THIS LITTLE EXERCISE</i>
<i>FOR FAY TO WATCH</i>

27:17.131 --> 27:20.009
TO UNDERSTAND HOW GOOD YOU ARE,
AND LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING,

27:20.009 --> 27:23.346
YOU CLEARLY PASSED
THE TEST.

27:23.346 --> 27:25.348
<i>YOU DID.</i>
<i>I WAS PROUD OF YOU ALL.</i>

27:25.348 --> 27:26.390
SO WELL DONE.

27:26.390 --> 27:27.934
<i>WE DO HAVE TO IMPROVE</i>
<i>THE FOOD, RIGHT?</i>

27:27.934 --> 27:29.227
<i>GRANTED.</i>
<i>YES?</i>

27:29.227 --> 27:30.603
<i>BUT FOR ME, THE RELATIONSHIP</i>
<i>WAS FAR MORE IMPORTANT</i>

27:30.603 --> 27:31.604
<i>THAN THE FOOD FIRST.</i>

27:31.604 --> 27:33.814
TODAY IS A NEW BEGINNING.
OKAY?

27:33.814 --> 27:37.109
GIVE ME 15 MINUTES, AND I'D LIKE
TO GET INTO THE KITCHEN

27:37.109 --> 27:40.696
AND START COOKING SOMETHING
EXCITING WITH THE TWO OWNERS.

27:40.696 --> 27:40.991
WELL DONE, ALL OF YOU.

27:40.991 --> 27:42.490
WELL DONE, ALL OF YOU.

27:42.490 --> 27:46.536
I'M REALLY EXCITED THAT FAY GOT
TO WATCH HOW WE RUN THE PLACE.

27:46.536 --> 27:48.120
I REALLY DO HOPE FAY STARTS

27:48.120 --> 27:50.414
TREATING ME AS A PARTNER
AND NOT HER NIECE.

27:50.414 --> 27:51.916
IT'S GONE ON
DEFINITELY TOO LONG,

27:51.916 --> 27:53.376
AND WE'RE READY
TO MOVE FORWARD.

27:53.376 --> 27:55.044
I REALLY HOPE,
IN THE FUTURE,

27:55.044 --> 27:57.046
<i>WE CAN AGREE</i>
<i>ABOUT THE STAFF MEETING,</i>

27:57.046 --> 28:00.174
AND WE HAVE TO ADDRESS
WHAT'S BOTHERING US.

28:00.174 --> 28:02.385
I KNOW NOW WE HAVE TO WORK
AS A TEAM,

28:02.385 --> 28:07.098
AND I HOPE THAT WE COULD MOVE
FROM MY OBSESSION

28:07.098 --> 28:08.558
WITH EVERYTHING BEING PERFECT.

28:08.558 --> 28:10.991
WE NEED TO ACT LIKE A TEAM,
AND WE NEED TO STRIVE AS A TEAM.

28:10.991 --> 28:12.311
WE NEED TO ACT LIKE A TEAM,
AND WE NEED TO STRIVE AS A TEAM.

28:12.311 --> 28:13.354
AND I REALIZE

28:13.354 --> 28:16.190
IT'S ABOUT TIME
TO TREAT BRENDA

28:16.190 --> 28:18.401
AS MY BUSINESS PARTNER
AND NOT ONLY MY NIECE.

28:18.401 --> 28:21.195
NOW I KNOW THAT WE NEED
TO FIX A LOT OF THINGS.

28:21.195 --> 28:24.907
WE DEFINITELY PROVED IT TO FAY
THAT WE CAN DO OUR JOBS.

28:24.907 --> 28:27.368
WE ARE CAPABLE OF HELPING HER
OUT WHEN SHE NEEDS,

28:27.368 --> 28:30.288
AND SHE JUST NEEDS TO ALLOW US
TO DO IT, SO...

28:30.288 --> 28:32.331
WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

28:32.331 --> 28:35.501
YOU DID A GOOD JOB.
I'M PROUD.

28:38.212 --> 28:40.256
LET'S GO, YOU TWO.
WHAT IS THAT?

28:40.256 --> 28:40.991
IT'S FRESH FISH.

28:40.991 --> 28:42.216
IT'S FRESH FISH.

28:42.216 --> 28:44.176
OH, IT'S DEFINITELY FRESH FISH.
HOW DOES IT FEEL?

28:44.176 --> 28:46.846
FEELS AWESOME.
HERE'S THE THING.

28:46.846 --> 28:48.889
BUYING FRESH, SENDING THAT
MESSAGE OUT TO YOUR CUSTOMERS

28:48.889 --> 28:50.141
IS THE ONLY MESSAGE
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE.

28:50.141 --> 28:52.310
SO I'M GONNA DO
TWO VERY SIMPLE DISHES.

28:52.310 --> 28:53.686
DO A NICE YELLOWTAIL,

28:53.686 --> 28:56.439
DO A NICE LITTLE SHRIMP KABOB.

28:56.439 --> 28:58.649
IT'S A OUT-OF-THIS-WORLD
EXPERIENCE

28:58.649 --> 29:00.109
TO BE TAUGHT BY CHEF RAMSAY.

29:00.109 --> 29:02.778
FIND THE GRILL,
AND START TO MARK IT.

29:02.778 --> 29:06.365
I AM LEARNING
THAT WHEN YOU SAY "FRESH,"

29:06.365 --> 29:07.992
IT MEANS REALLY FRESH.

29:07.992 --> 29:09.785
IT DOESN'T MEAN
IT'S FROZEN FRESH.

29:09.785 --> 29:10.991
PUT SOME JUICE
IN THE RICE.

29:10.991 --> 29:12.830
PUT SOME JUICE
IN THE RICE.

29:12.830 --> 29:15.374
MM, NOW YOU CAN SMELL
THE HERBS, OKAY?

29:15.374 --> 29:17.877
SMELLS AMAZING.
AND THE LEMON IN THERE.

29:17.877 --> 29:20.338
FROM THERE, MY HERBS GO IN,

29:20.338 --> 29:23.215
AND THEN I'VE GOT A LITTLE TOUCH
OF VEGETABLE STOCK.

29:23.215 --> 29:24.175
JUST A TOUCH.

29:24.175 --> 29:26.302
WHAT KIND OF STOCK?
<i>SO THAT GOES ON.</i>

29:26.302 --> 29:28.220
VEGETABLE STOCK.

29:28.220 --> 29:29.764
I'VE POURED MY HEART AND SOUL

29:29.764 --> 29:31.307
INTO THIS PLACE
THE LAST FIVE YEARS.

29:31.307 --> 29:34.310
AND THIS IS THE FIRST TIME
I FEEL LIKE

29:34.310 --> 29:35.978
AN EQUAL PARTNER WITH FAY.

29:35.978 --> 29:39.357
I'M JUST GONNA SHOW YOU
HOW WE PLATE THIS UP.

29:39.357 --> 29:40.608
WOW.

29:40.608 --> 29:40.991
IF WE COOK
JUST DELICIOUS AND FRESH

29:40.991 --> 29:43.653
IF WE COOK
JUST DELICIOUS AND FRESH

29:43.653 --> 29:46.822
AND IF BRENDA WILL CONTINUE
TO CHANGE HER WORK ETHICS,

29:46.822 --> 29:49.533
BE A BUSINESS OWNER,
I THINK

29:49.533 --> 29:51.744
WE'LL MAKE
A VERY STRONG TEAM.

29:51.744 --> 29:54.372
AMAZING.

29:54.372 --> 29:56.040
SOMETHING VERY IMPORTANT
YOU SHOULD BOTH KNOW.

29:56.040 --> 29:59.919
YESTERDAY, AFTER MY LUNCH,
I WENT AROUND TOWN.

29:59.919 --> 30:02.713
AND I ASKED JUST PEOPLE
WALKING TOWARDS ME,

30:02.713 --> 30:05.216
"TELL ME
ABOUT ZAYNA'S FLAMING GRILL."

30:05.216 --> 30:06.217
ZAYNA'S FLAMING GRILL.
EVER HEARD OF IT?

30:06.217 --> 30:07.635
NO.
DAMN.

30:07.635 --> 30:09.428
PASSED THROUGH, SEEN IT,
NEVER REALLY STOPPED.

30:09.428 --> 30:10.991
HAVE YOU BEEN?
I HAVE NOT.

30:10.991 --> 30:11.347
HAVE YOU BEEN?
I HAVE NOT.

30:11.347 --> 30:14.058
NOBODY'S HEARD OF THIS PLACE.
MAN.

30:14.058 --> 30:16.936
OVER 3/4 OF THE PEOPLE
I SPOKE TO,

30:16.936 --> 30:21.941
THEY HAVE NEVER HEARD
OF ZAYNA'S FLAMING GRILL.

30:21.941 --> 30:25.236
SO I'VE ARRANGED
FOR A SMALL, EXCLUSIVE SPOT

30:25.236 --> 30:26.320
AT THE REDONDO PIER.

30:26.320 --> 30:28.197
<i>WE'RE GONNA TELL REDONDO</i>

30:28.197 --> 30:31.367
THAT YOU'RE HERE TO STAY,
AND WE'RE HERE TO RELAUNCH.

30:31.367 --> 30:33.202
<i>OKAY?</i>
OKAY.

30:33.202 --> 30:34.704
<i>AND WE'RE GONNA TAKE</i>
<i>LITTLE SAMPLERS,</i>

30:34.704 --> 30:36.622
GET THE WORD OUT THERE.

30:36.622 --> 30:37.957
MOST IMPORTANTLY,
I WANT THEM LEAVING

30:37.957 --> 30:40.376
WITH ZAYNA'S FLAMING GRILL'S
FLAVOR.

30:40.376 --> 30:40.991
OKAY, AWESOME.

30:40.991 --> 30:43.129
OKAY, AWESOME.

30:43.129 --> 30:44.296
GET ALL THE TEAM TOGETHER,

30:44.296 --> 30:45.756
<i>AND WE'RE GONNA HEAD</i>
<i>TO THE REDONDO PIER, OKAY?</i>

30:45.756 --> 30:47.216
YES, SIR.
EXCELLENT.

30:47.216 --> 30:49.844
<i>YEAH?</i>

30:53.305 --> 30:55.975
COME OVER, GUYS.

30:55.975 --> 30:58.561
HOW ARE YOU FEELING?
FEELING GOOD.

30:58.561 --> 31:00.271
SO WE'RE RELAUNCHING
TOMORROW NIGHT.

31:00.271 --> 31:01.605
ALL RIGHT.
YEAH.

31:01.605 --> 31:03.274
ZAYNA'S FLAMING GRILL
IS NOW FLAMING HOT.

31:03.274 --> 31:06.277
WHY DON'T YOU AND I
WORK BEHIND?
ALL RIGHT.

31:06.277 --> 31:08.112
YEAH, AND YOU THREE
CAN MARKET THE HELL

31:08.112 --> 31:10.991
OUT OF THE NEW
ZAYNA'S FLAMING GRILL.
YES, ZAYNA'S FLAMING GRILL.

31:10.991 --> 31:11.240
OUT OF THE NEW
ZAYNA'S FLAMING GRILL.
YES, ZAYNA'S FLAMING GRILL.

31:11.240 --> 31:12.616
YEAH? GOT IT?
YES.

31:12.616 --> 31:15.786
OKAY, LET'S GO.
LET'S GO, LET'S GO, LET'S GO.

31:15.786 --> 31:17.621
YOU GUYS HUNGRY?
COME ON IN.

31:17.621 --> 31:20.207

PEOPLE THAT ACTUALLY LIVE
REALLY CLOSE

31:29.175 --> 31:31.218
OR JUST A FEW MINUTES AWAY
HAVE NEVER HEARD ABOUT US.

31:31.218 --> 31:33.262
WE'RE ZAYNA'S FLAMING GRILL
ON P. C. H. AND AVENUE "F."

31:33.262 --> 31:36.182
WE'RE DOING A NEW LAUNCH.
WE'D LOVE TO HAVE YOU IN.

31:36.182 --> 31:37.516
WE'RE BY THE BEACH.

31:37.516 --> 31:39.226
WE SHOULD LET THE COMMUNITY KNOW
THAT WE'RE HERE

31:39.226 --> 31:40.311
AND WE'RE SERVING
THE BEST OF THE BEST.

31:48.110 --> 31:50.404
I LOVE THE SAUCE.

31:50.404 --> 31:51.614
WE'VE NEVER DONE
ANYTHING LIKE THIS,

31:51.614 --> 31:53.574
SO I THINK THIS IS REALLY BIG,
TO COME OUT HERE

31:53.574 --> 31:55.868
AND COME TOGETHER
AND BE A TEAM.

31:55.868 --> 31:56.994
WE'D LOVE TO SEE YOU GUYS.

31:56.994 --> 31:58.078
IT'S A NEW BEGINNING.

31:58.078 --> 31:59.288
YOU GUYS
GOTTA COME CHECK US OUT.

31:59.288 --> 32:02.833
ZAYNA'S FLAMING GRILL
IS GONNA BE FLAMING AWESOME.

32:02.833 --> 32:04.376
IT'S GONNA BE AWESOME.

32:04.376 --> 32:07.171
WHAT'S GOING ON NOW IS JUST--
IT'S A WHOLE NEW ZAYNA.

32:07.171 --> 32:09.215
EVERYTHING IS
JUST FINALLY FALLING

32:09.215 --> 32:10.758
IN PLACE
THE WAY IT SHOULD BE.

32:10.758 --> 32:10.991
THE MOTIVATION AND DRIVE
THAT WAS LACKING IS BACK.

32:10.991 --> 32:13.385
THE MOTIVATION AND DRIVE
THAT WAS LACKING IS BACK.

32:13.385 --> 32:14.553
<i>I LOVE YOUR FOOD!</i>

32:14.553 --> 32:16.305
THANK YOU.
THANK YOU, YEAH!

32:16.305 --> 32:19.475
THE FLAME IS BACK, RIGHT?
THE FLAME IS BACK.

32:21.852 --> 32:22.853
COMING UP...

32:22.853 --> 32:24.522
HOW ARE WE DOING DOWN THERE?

32:24.522 --> 32:26.774
IT COULD BE
ZAYNA'S BIGGEST NIGHT EVER.

32:26.774 --> 32:28.776
FAY, DID YOU GET THAT?
FAY?

32:28.776 --> 32:30.528
BUT ON A NIGHT
WHEN SUCCESS RESTS

32:30.528 --> 32:31.904
IN THE HANDS
OF BRENDA AND FAY...

32:31.904 --> 32:33.823
FAY HAS SHUT DOWN.

32:33.823 --> 32:36.200
IT COULD TURN OUT
TO BE ITS BIGGEST DISASTER.

32:36.200 --> 32:38.285
FAY. FAY.

32:45.583 --> 32:47.335
WITH THE WORD OUT
TO THE COMMUNITY

32:47.335 --> 32:49.129

32:49.129 --> 32:52.048
CHEF RAMSAY AND HIS TEAM
HAVE JUST 12 HOURS TO TURN

32:52.048 --> 32:55.010

33:07.647 --> 33:09.774
LET US SEE IT.
<i>ON THE COUNT OF THREE.</i>

33:09.774 --> 33:11.609
ONE, TWO, THREE.

33:11.609 --> 33:11.960
<i>- WELCOME TO THE NEW ZAYNA.</i>

33:11.960 --> 33:15.405

<i>WE HAVE GIVEN IT</i>
<i>A FUN, BEACHY VIBE.</i>

33:34.799 --> 33:36.676
<i>WE HAVE COMPLETELY OPENED</i>
<i>THIS SPACE UP,</i>

33:36.676 --> 33:38.386
<i>WHICH HAS GIVEN YOU</i>
<i>ANOTHER 12 SEATS.</i>

33:38.386 --> 33:40.889
THIS IS A COMPLETELY
DIFFERENT RESTAURANT.

33:40.889 --> 33:41.960
<i>AND THEN WE GOT STOOLS.</i>

33:41.960 --> 33:42.807
<i>AND THEN WE GOT STOOLS.</i>

33:42.807 --> 33:44.225
WE'RE GONNA TAKE ADVANTAGE
OF THAT BAR.

33:44.225 --> 33:45.268
AMAZING.

33:45.268 --> 33:48.730
AT THE TABLES, YOU HAVE
THESE STUNNING PEWTER CHAIRS.

33:48.730 --> 33:50.315

33:55.403 --> 33:56.404
YOU NAME IT,
YOU'VE GOT IT.

33:56.404 --> 33:59.157
YOU CAN'T IMAGINE
HOW THANKFUL I AM FOR THIS.

33:59.157 --> 34:01.201
<i>AMAZING, COOL POP ART.</i>

THIS IS OUR DREAM
COME TRUE.

34:08.375 --> 34:09.918
IT IS.
DEFINITELY IS.

34:09.918 --> 34:11.461
IT COULDN'T BE MORE PERFECT.

34:11.461 --> 34:11.960
IT'S VERY HIP, VERY BEACHY,
AND WE'RE READY

34:11.960 --> 34:14.297
IT'S VERY HIP, VERY BEACHY,

34:14.297 --> 34:16.216

34:20.345 --> 34:22.305
I THOUGHT YOU--
OKAY.

34:22.305 --> 34:25.850
I HONESTLY NEVER DREAMED
ABOUT OWNING A PLACE LIKE THIS.

34:25.850 --> 34:29.354
MY RESTAURANT WAS
REALLY OLD-FASHIONED BEFORE.

34:29.354 --> 34:32.190
NOW, IT'S A BEAUTIFUL PLACE
FOR PEOPLE TO COME IN

34:32.190 --> 34:34.317
AFTER A DAY AT THE BEACH

34:34.317 --> 34:36.653
AND ENJOY
A BEAUTIFUL BEACH RESTAURANT.

34:38.530 --> 34:40.573
NOW THAT CHEF RAMSAY HAS BROUGHT
THE BEACH VIBE TO ZAYNA...

34:40.573 --> 34:41.960
GET IN LINE OVER THERE.

34:41.960 --> 34:42.283
GET IN LINE OVER THERE.

34:42.283 --> 34:44.828

OH, WOW.

34:45.995 --> 34:47.747
YUMMY.

34:47.747 --> 34:50.333
FIRST OFF, THE DIPS.
ROASTED RED PEPPER HUMMUS.

34:50.333 --> 34:52.419
<i>NOT LIQUID,</i>
<i>BUT A NICE TEXTURE TO HUMMUS.</i>

34:52.419 --> 34:54.295
<i>DELICIOUS TABBOULEH,</i>
<i>PARSLEY,</i>

34:54.295 --> 34:55.505

SERVED IN A PITA, SCALLIONS,

35:01.386 --> 35:02.387
<i>AND TAHINI AS WELL.</i>
WOW.

35:02.387 --> 35:04.472
SHRIMP KABOB
FINISHED WITH LEMON

35:04.472 --> 35:06.307
<i>AND BEAUTIFULLY SERVED</i>
<i>WITH A PITA BREAD.</i>

35:06.307 --> 35:08.476
LAST NIGHT, WE COOKED TOGETHER

35:08.476 --> 35:11.229
AGAIN, SERVED WITH POTATOES,
RED ONIONS, AND WE SERVE,

35:11.229 --> 35:11.960
GRILL THE FISH, AND SEND.

35:11.960 --> 35:12.564
GRILL THE FISH, AND SEND.

35:12.564 --> 35:14.190
<i>EXCITED TO TASTE?</i>

35:14.190 --> 35:15.358
DEFINITELY.
YES.
<i>YEAH?</i>

35:15.358 --> 35:17.944
HAVE A REALLY GOOD TASTE,
BECAUSE TONIGHT,

35:17.944 --> 35:20.196
<i>WE'RE GONNA RELAUNCH THIS</i>
<i>STUNNING MEDITERRANEAN GRILL</i>

35:20.196 --> 35:21.197

JUMP IN.

35:22.782 --> 35:25.160

RIGHT NOW.

35:27.746 --> 35:29.998
WOW.
YOU'RE GONNA LOVE THIS.

35:29.998 --> 35:32.292
IF I START LIKING THAT,
WE MIGHT RUN LOW

35:32.292 --> 35:33.543
<i>BEFORE THE CUSTOMERS</i>
<i>GET HERE.</i>

35:33.543 --> 35:35.128
DELICIOUS.
GOOD RECIPE.

35:35.128 --> 35:36.755
THIS NEW MENU IS A DREAM.

35:36.755 --> 35:39.591
A LITTLE BIT OF CHANGE
MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE.

35:39.591 --> 35:41.960
HOLY CRAP.
MMM, WE SHOULD PUT
THESE TWO TOGETHER.

35:41.960 --> 35:42.469
HOLY CRAP.
MMM, WE SHOULD PUT
THESE TWO TOGETHER.

35:42.469 --> 35:43.928
WATCH THIS.

35:45.138 --> 35:48.349
I AM READY TO LAUNCH
MY RESTAURANT TONIGHT.

35:48.349 --> 35:52.854
I HAVE EVERYTHING I NEED NOW
TO REALLY SERVE REDONDO BEACH,

35:52.854 --> 35:54.439
AND IT WILL BE JUST
A WONDERFUL FEELING

35:54.439 --> 35:57.275
TO HAVE BRENDA AND I
WORKING TOGETHER AS A TEAM.

36:08.745 --> 36:11.080
HELLO, WELCOME TO THE NEW
AND IMPROVED ZAYNA'S.

36:11.080 --> 36:11.960
HAVING SPREAD THE WORD
IN REDONDO BEACH

36:11.960 --> 36:13.458
HAVING SPREAD THE WORD
IN REDONDO BEACH

36:13.458 --> 36:15.668
ABOUT THE NEW LOOK AND MENU
AT ZAYNA FLAMING GRILL...

36:15.668 --> 36:17.754
THIS LOOKS SO GOOD.
IT DOES.

36:17.754 --> 36:19.881
THE RESTAURANT IS FULLY BOOKED
FOR RELAUNCH.

36:19.881 --> 36:21.466
IT LOOKS LIKE THE BEACH.

36:21.466 --> 36:23.134
IT DOES LOOK LIKE THE BEACH.
IT'S COOL.

36:23.134 --> 36:25.345
ARE YOU GUYS READY TO ORDER?

36:27.096 --> 36:28.097
THE YELLOWTAIL.

36:28.097 --> 36:29.516
THE ZUCCHINI FRITTERS.

36:29.516 --> 36:33.478
I'M SURE YOU LADIES
WILL ENJOY EVERYTHING.

36:33.478 --> 36:34.646
RIGHT, YOU READY?
WE'RE FIRED UP.

36:34.646 --> 36:35.647
<i>WE HAVE THE FLAME BACK,</i>

36:35.647 --> 36:37.524
AND I HAVE
TO SHOW YOU THAT TONIGHT.

36:37.524 --> 36:39.442
OKAY, HAVE YOU WARNED
YOUR HUSBAND THE FLAME'S BACK?

36:39.442 --> 36:40.819
I TOLD HIM EARLIER TODAY,

36:40.819 --> 36:41.960
AND HE THOUGHT I WAS
TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.

36:41.960 --> 36:42.946
AND HE THOUGHT I WAS
TALKING ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE.

36:45.698 --> 36:47.367
I'M SORRY.

36:47.367 --> 36:49.577
KEEP IT CLEAN--IT'S A FAMILY
RESTAURANT, FOR GOODNESS' SAKE.

36:52.330 --> 36:54.415
OKAY,
ZUCCHINI FRITTERS.

36:54.415 --> 36:56.084
I'LL START THAT.
<i>GOOD.</i>

36:56.084 --> 36:59.254
STARTING THE TWO CALAMARIS
AND ZUCCHINI, OKAY?

36:59.254 --> 37:00.421
OKAY.
<i>GOOD. THAT'S IT.</i>

37:00.421 --> 37:01.381
TALK.
THE MORE TALKING, THE BETTER.

37:01.381 --> 37:02.882
OKAY?
OKAY, BRENDA.

37:02.882 --> 37:06.553
CRISPY CALAMARI AND GRILLED
YELLOWTAIL AND WHAT ELSE?

37:06.553 --> 37:08.304
AND SHRIMP KABOB.
SHRIMP KABOB.

37:08.304 --> 37:11.474
FOR RELAUNCH, CHEF RAMSAY
HAS SET UP A NEW SYSTEM

37:11.474 --> 37:11.960
IN THE KITCHEN THAT HAS FAY
AND BRENDA WORKING SIDE BY SIDE.

37:11.960 --> 37:14.310
IN THE KITCHEN THAT HAS FAY
AND BRENDA WORKING SIDE BY SIDE.

37:14.310 --> 37:15.353
FIRING UP FRIES.

37:15.353 --> 37:17.397
BEEF KABOB.
RICE ON GRILL.

37:17.397 --> 37:20.108
AND SO FAR, THE PLAN IS WORKING.

37:20.108 --> 37:21.234
THAT'S YUMMY.

37:21.234 --> 37:22.735
SO GOOD.

37:22.735 --> 37:24.279
EVERYTHING WAS
SEASONED PERFECTLY.

37:24.279 --> 37:26.406
BUT AS THE ORDERS
START TO FLY IN...

37:26.406 --> 37:31.202
TWO CALAMARIS AND A ZUCCHINI
FRITTER COMING UP, OKAY, FAY?

37:31.202 --> 37:32.287
FAY HAS STOPPED COMMUNICATING.

37:32.287 --> 37:34.289
ARE WE GOOD ON RICE?
DO WE NEED RICE, FAY?

37:34.289 --> 37:36.332
<i>FAY, TALK TO BRENDA.</i>

37:36.332 --> 37:40.378
AND THAT'S SLOWING DOWN
THE DELIVERY OF THE FOOD.

37:41.546 --> 37:41.960
I KNOW.

37:41.960 --> 37:43.298
I KNOW.

37:43.298 --> 37:45.550
HEY, YOU'RE NOT EVEN--LOOK
AT ME, YOU'VE STOPPED TALKING.

37:45.550 --> 37:47.677
I'M DOING IT.
I KNOW, BUT TALK AND WORK
AT THE SAME TIME, OKAY?

37:47.677 --> 37:48.887
OKAY.
HERE WE ARE.

37:48.887 --> 37:51.848
CAN I PLEASE KNOW THE STATUS
ON TABLE NINE?

37:51.848 --> 37:55.310
<i>UM, DID YOU HEAR ME?</i>

37:56.728 --> 37:57.937
FAY'S SO USED TO HAVING
HER MIND-SET

37:57.937 --> 37:59.355
WHERE SHE HAS
TO DO EVERYTHING...

37:59.355 --> 38:00.398
FAY, COME ON.

38:00.398 --> 38:03.151
AND SHE JUST NEEDS TO UNDERSTAND
THAT IT'S NOT

38:03.151 --> 38:06.195
JUST HER IN THE KITCHEN ANYMORE,
THAT IT'S HER AND BRENDA.

38:06.195 --> 38:10.158
HOW FAR OUT
IS TABLE NINE?

38:10.158 --> 38:11.960
NO ANSWER.
I KNOW.

38:11.960 --> 38:12.410
NO ANSWER.
I KNOW.

38:12.410 --> 38:13.411
<i>WHAT'S GOING NEXT, PLEASE,</i>
<i>BRENDA?</i>

38:13.411 --> 38:14.704
BECAUSE FAY'S TURNED OFF.

38:14.704 --> 38:19.334
WE GOT A LAMB KABOB
MEDIUM-RARE AND THE YELLOWTAIL.

38:19.334 --> 38:21.044
<i>LET ME KNOW</i>
<i>IF YOU NEED SOMETHING, FAY.</i>

38:21.044 --> 38:24.255
<i>SHE'S NOT EVEN SAYING ANYTHING.</i>
<i>SHE'S JUST TURNED OFF.</i>

38:24.255 --> 38:27.425
FAY IS JUST NOT COMMUNICATING,
AND I JUST TRULY HOPE

38:27.425 --> 38:29.802
THAT WE CAN MAKE IT
THROUGH THIS DINNER

38:29.802 --> 38:31.429
WITHOUT TOTALLY FALLING APART.

38:31.429 --> 38:32.430
<i>HOW ARE WE DOING, FAY?</i>

38:32.430 --> 38:35.099
FAY. FAY. FAY.

38:44.357 --> 38:46.693
IT'S RELAUNCH NIGHT
AT ZAYNA FLAMING GRILL,

38:46.693 --> 38:49.237
AND CHEF RAMSAY
HAS IMPLEMENTED

38:49.237 --> 38:50.989
A TWO-CHEF SYSTEM
IN THE KITCHEN...

38:50.989 --> 38:52.407
HOW ARE WE DOING
DOWN THERE, FAY?

38:52.407 --> 38:54.742
WHERE COMMUNICATION IS THE KEY.

38:54.742 --> 38:56.452
FAY, DID YOU GET THAT?

38:56.452 --> 38:58.955
BUT SHORTLY AFTER DINNER
STARTED, FAY HAS SHUT DOWN

38:58.955 --> 39:01.583
AND IS NO LONGER COMMUNICATING
WITH BRENDA.

39:01.583 --> 39:05.587
BRENDA, 30 SECONDS?

39:05.587 --> 39:07.672
FAY HAS SHUT DOWN.

39:07.672 --> 39:09.632
SHE'S SO USED TO WORKING ON
HER OWN, SHE'S REFUSING TO TALK,

39:09.632 --> 39:11.069
SO YOU GOTTA--
GOTTA GET SOME--

39:11.069 --> 39:11.551
SO YOU GOTTA--
GOTTA GET SOME--

39:11.551 --> 39:13.303
<i>SHE'S JUST COMPLETELY FLAT--</i>
<i>SILENT AND FLAT.</i>
<i>OKAY, ALL RIGHT.</i>

39:13.303 --> 39:14.596
NOW, YOU'RE A PARTNER,
DON'T FORGET.

39:14.596 --> 39:16.180
YOU'RE IN THE DRIVER'S SEAT NOW.
EXCELLENT.

39:16.180 --> 39:18.182
GET IT GOING, PLEASE.
PLEASE.
OKAY.

39:18.182 --> 39:19.976
HOW WE DOING, FAY?
TALK TO ME.

39:19.976 --> 39:21.561
FAY DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO WORK
WITH A TEAM.

39:21.561 --> 39:23.646
COME ON, TALK TOGETHER, YEAH?
LET'S GO.

39:23.646 --> 39:25.773
SHE'S USED TO DOING EVERYTHING
BY HERSELF.

39:25.773 --> 39:28.026
TELL BRENDA
WHAT YOU'RE DOING THERE.

39:28.026 --> 39:29.611
OKAY.
RIGHT BEHIND YOU.
TALK TO BRENDA.

39:29.611 --> 39:32.572
BUT I AM AN OWNER,
AND I AM A BOSS.

39:32.572 --> 39:35.533
AND I NEED TO TAKE CONTROL AND
BRING THIS PLACE BACK TO LIFE.

39:35.533 --> 39:37.493
FAY, WE JUST NEED YOU
TO RESPOND.

39:37.493 --> 39:40.163
JUST BECAUSE WE HAD
A FEW MINUTES OF DOWNFALL,

39:40.163 --> 39:41.069
ALL WE DO IS GET RIGHT BACK UP
AND KEEP GOING.

39:41.069 --> 39:43.333
ALL WE DO IS GET RIGHT BACK UP
AND KEEP GOING.

39:43.333 --> 39:44.334
YES. YES.
ALL RIGHT?

39:44.334 --> 39:47.045
<i>WE DON'T DWELL ON IT.</i>

39:47.045 --> 39:49.505
WE PICK UP AND MOVE ON.
YES.

39:49.505 --> 39:50.965
TABLE THREE.

39:50.965 --> 39:54.218
CRISPY CALAMARI AND GRILLED
YELLOWTAIL AND WHAT ELSE?

39:54.218 --> 39:55.219
AND SHRIMP KABOB.
SHRIMP KABOB.

39:55.219 --> 39:56.554
KEEP IT GOING, GUYS.

39:56.554 --> 39:57.555
WHAT DO I NEED
FOR TABLE NINE, FAY?

39:57.555 --> 40:00.600
MEATBALL GYRO.
MEATBALLS ARE IN THE OVEN.

40:00.600 --> 40:03.645
GOOD NEWS IS YOU'RE TALKING.
MORE BREAKING NEWS.
THANK YOU.

40:03.645 --> 40:07.231
WITH BRENDA TAKING CONTROL
AND ENCOURAGING FAY,

40:07.231 --> 40:08.566
SHE IS RESPONSIVE AGAIN.

40:08.566 --> 40:11.069
TWO CHICKEN AND THE ONE LAMB
IS READY.

40:11.069 --> 40:11.486
TWO CHICKEN AND THE ONE LAMB
IS READY.

40:11.486 --> 40:12.528
EXCELLENT.
<i>NICE.</i>

40:12.528 --> 40:13.571
<i>TABLE EIGHT.</i>
EXCELLENT.

40:13.571 --> 40:15.448
AND THIS DUO ARE NOW

40:15.448 --> 40:17.492
PUSHING OUT ORDERS
AT A MUCH FASTER RATE.

40:17.492 --> 40:20.495
I LIKE THE ZUCCHINI FRITTER.
IT'S GOOD, YEAH.

40:20.495 --> 40:22.121
MMM.

40:27.502 --> 40:28.628
WE GOT EACH OTHER'S BACK.
WE'RE A TEAM.

40:28.628 --> 40:31.005
I AM VERY PROUD
OF BRENDA TONIGHT.

40:31.005 --> 40:35.385
SHE WAS MY BACKBONE, AND IT WAS
REALLY NICE WORKING AS A TEAM.

40:35.385 --> 40:37.553
I HOPE YOU ENJOYED EVERYTHING,
LADIES.

40:37.553 --> 40:40.223
YES, YES, IT WAS VERY GOOD.
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

40:40.223 --> 40:41.069
THANK YOU.
BYE.

40:41.069 --> 40:42.350
THANK YOU.
BYE.

40:42.350 --> 40:43.518
<i>ON THE COUNT OF THREE, ZAYNA'S.</i>

40:43.518 --> 40:46.562
ONE, TWO, THREE.

40:46.562 --> 40:48.898
ZAYNA'S!

40:48.898 --> 40:51.150
<i>THE FLAME IS BACK.</i>

40:51.150 --> 40:53.778
<i>GOD BLESS YOU ALL.</i>

40:53.778 --> 40:55.738
FIRST OF ALL, NIGHT ONE,
YOU ACHIEVED A LOT.

40:55.738 --> 40:56.906
IT WASN'T GOING
TO BE PERFECT,

40:56.906 --> 40:59.992
BUT LET ME TELL YOU,
IT WAS PRETTY GOOD.

40:59.992 --> 41:01.661
FEEDBACK
FROM THE CUSTOMERS.

41:01.661 --> 41:02.787
<i>WHAT WAS IT?</i>
I DIDN'T GET ONE BAD COMPLAINT.

41:02.787 --> 41:04.038
GREAT.

41:04.038 --> 41:05.873
I TALKED
TO A FEW OF THE TABLES,

41:05.873 --> 41:07.709
AND THEY WERE REALLY HAPPY.

41:07.709 --> 41:09.752
THEY LOVED THE NEW DECOR,
AND THEY SAID

41:09.752 --> 41:11.069
<i>THIS IS WHAT A BEACH RESTAURANT</i>
<i>SHOULD LOOK LIKE.</i>

41:11.069 --> 41:11.754
<i>THIS IS WHAT A BEACH RESTAURANT</i>
<i>SHOULD LOOK LIKE.</i>

41:11.754 --> 41:16.050
THE LOOK OF THIS RESTAURANT
IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT.

41:16.050 --> 41:17.719
<i>DO YOU KNOW WHAT ELSE</i>
<i>IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT?</i>

41:17.719 --> 41:19.637
THE WAY
YOU TREAT EACH OTHER.

41:19.637 --> 41:23.307
I AM VERY PROUD,
VERY PROUD OF ALL OF YOU.

41:23.307 --> 41:25.560
<i>BRENDA, YOU ARE</i>
<i>A NATURAL-BORN LEADER.</i>

41:25.560 --> 41:27.645
<i>TONIGHT, YOU CONFIRMED</i>
<i>YOU'RE A PARTNER.</i>

41:27.645 --> 41:28.771
THANK YOU.

41:28.771 --> 41:31.649
TODAY, SHE PULLED HER WEIGHT,
AND SHE HOLD MY BACK UP.

41:31.649 --> 41:33.025
<i>SHE'S AMAZING.</i>

41:33.025 --> 41:37.113
CHEF RAMSAY GAVE ME MY FAMILY
BACK AND MY RESTAURANT BACK.

41:37.113 --> 41:39.991
I FINALLY HAVE THE PARTNER
I ALWAYS WISHED FOR.

41:39.991 --> 41:41.069
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

41:41.069 --> 41:41.743
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

41:41.743 --> 41:43.911
I REALLY APPRECIATE THIS
SO MUCH.

41:43.911 --> 41:45.037
<i>BEST OF LUCK.</i>

41:45.037 --> 41:46.539
CHEF RAMSAY
HAS CHANGED OUR LIVES,

41:46.539 --> 41:49.459
AND I AM WORRIED ABOUT FAY
GOING BACK TO HER OLD WAYS...

41:49.459 --> 41:51.669
WELL DONE, MY DARLING.
GOOD JOB.

41:51.669 --> 41:53.880
BUT WE'LL SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

41:56.174 --> 41:57.550
WHEN I FIRST ARRIVED,
I DIDN'T THINK

41:57.550 --> 42:00.344
A RELAUNCH OF THIS RESTAURANT
WAS EVEN POSSIBLE.

42:00.344 --> 42:02.054
BRENDA AND FAY
WERE COMPLETELY AT ODDS,

42:02.054 --> 42:04.724
AND THE STAFF BEHIND THEM--
THEY HAD NO DIRECTION.

42:04.724 --> 42:06.517
BUT UNBELIEVABLY, TONIGHT,

42:06.517 --> 42:09.353
BRENDA AND FAY WERE WORKING
SIDE BY SIDE IN THEIR KITCHEN.

42:09.353 --> 42:11.069
MY ONLY HOPE NOW
IS THAT FAY REALLY UNDERSTANDS

42:11.069 --> 42:12.523
MY ONLY HOPE NOW
IS THAT FAY REALLY UNDERSTANDS

42:12.523 --> 42:14.901
THAT SHE'S NOT
IN THIS ALONE.

42:14.901 --> 42:18.654
WOW.
BEATEN BY A STORE-BOUGHT HUMMUS.

42:18.654 --> 42:20.740
UNBELIEVABLE.

42:20.740 --> 42:22.283
AFTER CHEF RAMSAY LEFT...

42:22.283 --> 42:23.576
YOU'RE GONNA COME CROSS OUT
WHAT I JUST TOOK OUT.

42:23.576 --> 42:24.744
OKAY, BABY.

42:24.744 --> 42:27.580
ZAYNA BECAME A POPULAR SPOT

42:27.580 --> 42:29.373
IN REDONDO BEACH.
REALLY GOOD.

42:29.373 --> 42:30.374
BUT UNFORTUNATELY...

42:30.374 --> 42:31.501
THAT CHICKEN IS NOT DONE.

42:31.501 --> 42:33.211
FAY HAS TAKEN A STEP BACK.

42:33.211 --> 42:37.006
FLIP THE CHICKEN BECAUSE THIS IS
THE HOTTEST SPOT ON THE GRILL.

42:37.006 --> 42:38.591
IT'S BURNING.
THAT'S WHY.

42:38.591 --> 42:40.635
AND HER STUBBORNNESS
HAS RESULTED

42:40.635 --> 42:41.069
IN VANESSA AND AMEL
LEAVING THE RESTAURANT.

42:41.069 --> 42:42.637
IN VANESSA AND AMEL
LEAVING THE RESTAURANT.

42:42.637 --> 42:43.679
WHATEVER.

42:43.679 --> 42:46.599
MEATBALLS ARE HEATING UP
FOR TABLE SIX.

42:46.599 --> 42:48.309
ON THE POSITIVE SIDE,

42:48.309 --> 42:49.811
BRENDA HAS TAKEN ON
A MORE ACTIVE ROLE.

42:49.811 --> 42:51.854
IT'S ALMOST READY.
<i>EXCELLENT.</i>

42:51.854 --> 42:53.064
AND THE TWO OWNERS

42:53.064 --> 42:54.315
CONTINUE TO WORK
ON THEIR RELATIONSHIP...

42:54.315 --> 42:56.400
KEEP IT UP, YOU'RE DOING GOOD.
THANK YOU.

42:56.400 --> 42:58.694
AS WELL AS MAINTAIN
THEIR NEWFOUND SUCCESS.

42:58.694 --> 42:59.654
WE'RE GLAD
TO HAVE YOU HERE.

42:59.654 --> 43:01.823
THANK YOU.
HOPE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

43:01.823 --> 43:04.450
THANK YOU.
