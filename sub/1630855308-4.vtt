PRIYA: Whoa. Um...

00:35.162 --> 00:37.162
What?

00:37.682 --> 00:39.682
This.

00:40.082 --> 00:42.082
Oh, my God.

00:42.442 --> 00:44.042
Do you guys believe in omens?

00:44.122 --> 00:46.122
Omens for what?

00:47.802 --> 00:49.362
I think I might be pregnant.

00:49.442 --> 00:51.642
Huh? To who?

00:55.082 --> 00:57.922
-Are you sure?
-Didn't you use a condom?

00:59.762 --> 01:02.722
I wanna say yes,
but we were just...

01:02.802 --> 01:06.282
We were so messy and I can't
remember a thousand per cent

01:06.362 --> 01:07.562
what was going on down there

01:07.642 --> 01:09.002
and everything was just
really patchy and...

01:09.082 --> 01:11.082
Have you taken a test?

01:12.762 --> 01:14.522
But I was really tired
the other day, remember?

01:14.602 --> 01:16.402
And I really needed
to vom yesterday

01:16.482 --> 01:19.642
and right now,
I am bloated as fuck.

01:19.722 --> 01:21.162
We just had Betty's Burgers.

01:21.242 --> 01:22.842
And I just started using
this period tracker...

01:22.922 --> 01:24.362
Your cycle is super flaky.

01:24.442 --> 01:28.522
Yeah, but if it's right,
then...I'm late.

01:30.362 --> 01:32.362
We should get you a test.

01:32.962 --> 01:36.682
Wait, what? You actually
think I'm pregnant?

01:36.762 --> 01:39.602
I say no,
but I have zero context.

01:39.682 --> 01:41.042
-OK.
-KATE: Let's go.

01:41.122 --> 01:43.242
I can't tell if you're,
like, messing with me or not...

01:43.322 --> 01:44.242
We're being serious.

01:44.322 --> 01:45.482
I'm not convinced.
I don't know.

it's weird

02:26.722 --> 02:29.602
that, like,
the weather or whatever

02:29.682 --> 02:32.922
can just change everything?

02:33.002 --> 02:35.482
Everything's gonna be OK,
Priya.

02:35.562 --> 02:40.122
Like, if it wasn't windy
on our first day of Year 7,

02:40.202 --> 02:42.162
I would have never
gotten pollen in my eyes,

02:42.242 --> 02:43.842
Maya would have never been upset

02:43.922 --> 02:45.642
that her hat blew off in front
of everybody

02:45.722 --> 02:48.042
and we would've never met in the
bathroom before the bell went.

02:48.122 --> 02:50.882
We would have met literally
10 minutes later in math.

02:50.962 --> 02:53.042
Um, we might not have
sat next to each other.

02:53.122 --> 02:56.322
Pri, whatever happens,
we've got your back.

02:56.402 --> 02:58.522

02:58.602 --> 03:01.402
I'm...I'm just saying.

03:23.122 --> 03:25.122
Maybe it's wrong.

03:27.002 --> 03:29.282
I mean, my sister
had two negatives

03:29.362 --> 03:33.682
and she still had to
have an abortion, right?

03:35.082 --> 03:37.802
I mean,
we both keep so hydrated,

03:37.882 --> 03:41.322
maybe our pee is just
too diluted to show up.

03:41.402 --> 03:45.642
Or maybe...maybe these tests
aren't made for brown women.

03:47.842 --> 03:50.442
So I should get a blood test
to be sure, right?

03:50.522 --> 03:51.922
If you think so.

03:52.002 --> 03:55.322
Cool, 'cause imagine if I told
Tully's mum the wrong thing.

03:58.242 --> 04:01.602
-Why would you...
-Tell her anything?

04:02.642 --> 04:05.962
She'd be the grandma.
She'd want to know either way.

04:07.962 --> 04:11.122
OK, you don't need to
look at me like that.

04:11.202 --> 04:13.962
It's not like I've actually
bought a Kia Carnival

04:14.042 --> 04:17.882
and a car seat or a bassinet
and a change table and a crib

04:17.962 --> 04:19.882

what needs baby-proofing.

about getting pregnant.

05:08.322 --> 05:10.042

with vaginas, then.

if that's in my future.

were imagining

17:49.202 --> 17:50.682
when they commissioned me

a slew of empty wine bottles,

so much of my early work.
