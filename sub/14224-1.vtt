WEBVTT

00:35.953 --> 00:36.995
Come on.

00:37.579 --> 00:38.580
Come on.

01:07.025 --> 01:08.318
Why?

01:09.861 --> 01:11.363
Better?

01:15.659 --> 01:17.286
It's alright.

03:46.435 --> 03:48.770
Well, all that was twelve months ago.

03:49.438 --> 03:51.398
And know we gotta find out
what effect the oil

03:51.440 --> 03:54.192
and the new detergent they
used to disperse the oil

03:54.234 --> 03:55.527
has had on seashore life.

03:55.736 --> 03:56.862
On Balfe huh?

03:57.320 --> 03:59.990
Well Balfe is the nearest island,
and the one worst hit at the time.

04:02.534 --> 04:04.578
We've changed the program three times.

04:04.745 --> 04:06.705
And the answer is still the same.
Still the same.

04:06.955 --> 04:08.999
The results would look
very ugly on a graph.

04:09.332 --> 04:10.625
Put them on a graph then.

04:10.876 --> 04:11.877
Then what?

04:12.294 --> 04:14.588
Perhaps too much can
frighten the petrol companies

04:14.629 --> 04:16.380
into stopping using lead additives.

04:16.464 --> 04:17.882
Heck, you'll need more than that.

04:19.216 --> 04:21.678
So we want samples of uh, seaweed..

04:22.137 --> 04:24.139
Gastropods, bivalves...

04:24.556 --> 04:26.016
crustacea...

04:26.224 --> 04:28.477
a few gulls if you can get em,
without killing yourself.

04:29.186 --> 04:31.229
<i>But I don't suppose there
were many effected.</i>

04:31.313 --> 04:32.647
Anyway, don't stay away too long.

04:32.689 --> 04:35.650
Supposing I like it, can't
I have a few days rest?

04:36.109 --> 04:37.027
No!

04:37.110 --> 04:39.738
I shouldn't need to be there
more than a day, I ah...

04:40.113 --> 04:41.656
Ok, well have a good trip.

04:41.740 --> 04:42.866
Thanks, see ya.

05:05.096 --> 05:07.015
So you're the ball spin?

05:07.182 --> 05:08.850
That's right.

05:11.603 --> 05:13.563
You'll find em in a strange...

05:13.897 --> 05:15.774
close slow down ball.

05:17.734 --> 05:19.569
How often to you call?

05:19.736 --> 05:20.904
Ohhh...

05:21.196 --> 05:23.949
Mondays, Wednesdays, and Saturdays.

05:24.574 --> 05:26.117
Weather permitting.

05:26.910 --> 05:29.913
Could you make an extra call
and pick me up tomorrow?

05:33.250 --> 05:34.918
In and out quick eh?

05:36.628 --> 05:38.380
<i>No, No but I</i>

05:38.463 --> 05:40.215
should be finished by tomorrow afternoon.

05:40.298 --> 05:41.633
Here we are.

05:41.967 --> 05:43.677
You can see the village.

06:10.871 --> 06:12.622
Morning, Mrs. Straker.

06:12.789 --> 06:14.624
Morning Alex.

06:15.333 --> 06:16.918
Tom still poor even?

06:17.002 --> 06:18.545
Oh, he'll soon be up and about.

06:18.962 --> 06:21.131
Here your mail.

06:23.800 --> 06:24.801
Morning.

06:25.510 --> 06:27.637
Oh this is Doctor...

06:27.804 --> 06:28.805
Shaw.

06:28.889 --> 06:29.931
Doctor?

06:31.474 --> 06:33.476
Come all the way from London.

06:35.979 --> 06:37.063
That's the lot.

06:37.647 --> 06:39.816
You, staying for a drink then?

06:40.191 --> 06:42.110
<i>No, no, I best get back.</i>

06:42.444 --> 06:43.862
I'll see you tomorrow then eh?

06:43.987 --> 06:45.155
Bout three be alright?

06:45.196 --> 06:46.323
Fine, fine.

06:46.823 --> 06:48.617
Alright boy, we can can back now.

06:48.658 --> 06:50.327
You're alright, I'll give you a hand.

06:50.702 --> 06:51.703
Yes?

07:02.964 --> 07:04.382
This it?

07:11.181 --> 07:13.683
I'll just dump this inside shall I?
No.

07:15.810 --> 07:17.020
It's alright.

07:17.479 --> 07:18.855
I'll take it now.

07:19.105 --> 07:21.149
I'm looking for somewhere to
stay for the night.

07:21.358 --> 07:22.984
We don't cater for visitors.

07:23.193 --> 07:24.778
There must be somewhere?

07:25.445 --> 07:26.446
No.

07:28.031 --> 07:30.200
We're just little cottages see?

07:31.409 --> 07:33.244
Rector's own a big house here.

07:33.370 --> 07:35.455
Alright I'll ask at the
rector then, where's that?

07:37.207 --> 07:39.542
Round the corner on the left.

07:39.834 --> 07:41.169
You can't miss it.

07:41.336 --> 07:42.420
Thank you.

08:05.527 --> 08:07.404
No, you mustn't.

08:32.095 --> 08:33.304
Who's there?

08:34.681 --> 08:35.597
What are you doing?

08:35.640 --> 08:37.558
<i>An, I didn't think anyone was in.</i>

08:39.102 --> 08:40.352
What do you want?

08:40.437 --> 08:41.855
<i>Well I just arrived on the island</i>

08:41.895 --> 08:43.606
and I want somewhere to stay for the night.

08:43.898 --> 08:44.941
Why come here?

08:44.983 --> 08:46.109
This is not a lodging house.

08:46.192 --> 08:47.736
Well, I was told I could
find accommodation.

08:47.777 --> 08:48.778
Told?

08:49.487 --> 08:50.697
Who are you anyway?

08:50.864 --> 08:52.574
My name is Shaw, Dr. Shaw.

08:54.993 --> 08:56.244
I can't help you!

08:56.786 --> 08:57.912
I can't help you.

08:58.163 --> 09:00.206
Well just a minute...
I can't help you!

09:30.612 --> 09:31.738
Come in.

09:31.780 --> 09:33.364
Use the back door.

09:49.547 --> 09:51.174
<i>What can I do for you sir?</i>

09:51.341 --> 09:52.217
Are you the policeman?

09:52.342 --> 09:53.426
That's me.

09:55.136 --> 09:56.429
My name is Shaw...

09:56.554 --> 09:59.516
I've just arrived and I'm having
difficulty in finding somewhere to sleep.

09:59.557 --> 10:01.643
<i>Oh, well I imagine you would have.</i>

10:01.810 --> 10:03.728
Just for the one night,
I'll be off again tomorrow.

10:03.770 --> 10:04.771
You got business here?

10:04.854 --> 10:07.482
I don't see what it's got a do with you
but yes, I have, yes.

10:15.073 --> 10:17.450
Well, you could ask Miss
Johnson up at the Bobby.

10:17.826 --> 10:20.078
Up here on the lane leading into the woods.

10:21.079 --> 10:22.413
Thank you.

10:24.082 --> 10:25.583
Just the one night is it?

10:25.917 --> 10:27.710
Just the one night, yes.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.146
Come in.

10:47.564 --> 10:49.315
Your coffee Doctor.

10:49.399 --> 10:50.400
Thank you.

10:51.609 --> 10:53.278
Did you enjoy your supper?

10:53.361 --> 10:54.362
Delicious, thank you.

10:55.029 --> 10:56.865
Ah, are you going to join me for a cup?

10:57.490 --> 10:59.200
Oh, no.

10:59.450 --> 11:01.953
That's for Miss Brown, my other guest.

11:41.159 --> 11:44.329
Why is this place called
the Balfe do you suppose?

11:45.038 --> 11:46.289
I's a common word...

11:46.331 --> 11:47.999
It's used in many dialects.

11:48.333 --> 11:49.751
It's mean hut or cottage

11:49.834 --> 11:51.211
and comes from the same root

11:51.294 --> 11:52.837
as the word, booth.

11:53.087 --> 11:56.174
Which is the north border
and from the Middle English meaning bu-flay

11:57.217 --> 11:58.885
meaning to dwell.

12:00.261 --> 12:02.055
I take it you're the school mistress?

12:02.138 --> 12:03.056
What's your name?

12:03.139 --> 12:04.682
Victoria Brahm.

12:05.099 --> 12:08.269
It seemed boorish to sit under the
same roof and not to introduce ourselves.

12:10.355 --> 12:12.523
It's been rather one sided so far.

12:13.191 --> 12:15.568
My name is Dell Shore.

12:16.819 --> 12:18.029
Come in.

12:18.321 --> 12:19.572
Thank you.

12:21.824 --> 12:23.451
Nice fire.

12:23.618 --> 12:24.702
Thank you.

12:24.786 --> 12:25.870
Nice room.

12:26.162 --> 12:27.163
Thank you.

12:27.622 --> 12:30.833
Is the food always so awful on this island?

12:31.042 --> 12:32.627
<i>Yes, I think so.</i>

12:33.211 --> 12:34.796
you'll get used to it.

12:35.004 --> 12:37.131
You're not an islander are you?

12:37.173 --> 12:39.217
No, I'm a foreigner.

12:40.009 --> 12:42.178
How long you been here?
Two years.

12:42.720 --> 12:45.181
How did you find them
when you first came here?

12:45.598 --> 12:47.475
Was it difficult at first?

12:48.101 --> 12:49.727
Yes, they were.

12:50.144 --> 12:52.188
They're just beginning to accept me now.

12:52.313 --> 12:55.149
I think it would take longer with me,
they seem an odd lot.

12:55.275 --> 12:56.442
I mean...

12:56.693 --> 12:58.361
don't they?

13:10.123 --> 13:12.375
Why have you come here?

13:12.375 --> 13:16.713
To study the effects on seashore life
of that tanker sinking here last year.

13:16.754 --> 13:17.922
Oh, you're a scientist.

13:17.964 --> 13:19.966
<i>That's right, I work for Doomwatch.</i>

13:20.466 --> 13:21.843
The pollution people.

13:21.884 --> 13:23.720
<i>That's anti-pollution I hope.</i>

13:24.262 --> 13:26.139
How long are you gonna stay here?

13:26.514 --> 13:28.224
Everybody asks me that.

13:28.308 --> 13:29.892
It just seemed polite to ask.

13:29.934 --> 13:31.394
Not the way they ask it.

13:32.020 --> 13:33.688
Hey, look at this.

13:34.939 --> 13:37.775
<i>No, no, I don't want
to be put away.</i>

13:38.109 --> 13:39.235
Well, they're just
going for a walk.

13:39.277 --> 13:41.237
At this time of the night,
you must be joking?

13:44.657 --> 13:47.785
Something strange, they seemed
to be forcing the old man along.

13:49.203 --> 13:50.705
Well maybe he doesn't like walking.

13:50.788 --> 13:52.165
- Do you know who they were?
- No I don't.

13:52.206 --> 13:53.458
It was too dark

13:53.541 --> 13:54.792
<i>and I couldn't see.</i>

16:23.149 --> 16:24.358
He's coming in here.

16:24.942 --> 16:27.236
Alright, just leave him be.

16:39.332 --> 16:40.583
Afternoon.

16:43.794 --> 16:45.338
<i>Can I get a drink here?</i>

16:45.963 --> 16:47.965
Just give Mrs. Straker a shout.

16:48.174 --> 16:49.050
Betty!

16:49.091 --> 16:50.218
I'll get you a drink.

16:50.301 --> 16:51.719
No, no my turn.

16:51.761 --> 16:52.595
Yes?

16:52.678 --> 16:54.889
Yes, I think I'd like a beer, please.

16:54.931 --> 16:56.974
Another couple over here,
too, please Betty.

16:57.099 --> 16:58.976
I'll get it I said!

16:58.976 --> 17:01.187
Oh, c'mon George, let me get it.

17:01.479 --> 17:03.272
I know how things be
with you at the moment.

17:03.356 --> 17:04.397
What do you mean?

17:04.440 --> 17:05.650
Well, I didn't mean that.

17:06.108 --> 17:07.484
Okay, thanks.

17:07.527 --> 17:08.444
You buy me a drink.

17:08.444 --> 17:09.987
What did you mean saying that?

17:10.029 --> 17:10.905
Easy now.

17:10.905 --> 17:13.324
- George!
- Think you're so big!

17:13.366 --> 17:14.450
Clean it up.

17:14.492 --> 17:16.077
You be lucky.

17:16.117 --> 17:17.328
Damn problem.

17:17.369 --> 17:18.663
You want pain?

17:18.704 --> 17:21.624
- You never bloodied up...
- That's enough of that.

17:21.665 --> 17:22.791
Get out!

17:22.875 --> 17:24.544
Get out, George!

17:24.710 --> 17:27.003
Come back when you got control of yourself.

17:36.013 --> 17:37.807
Dr. Shaw?

17:41.561 --> 17:42.979
Your beer.

17:43.271 --> 17:44.272
Oh yeah.

18:00.246 --> 18:01.080
Yes?

18:01.163 --> 18:03.332
<i>Hello? It's Doomwatch in London.</i>

18:03.374 --> 18:04.375
Yes?

18:05.126 --> 18:06.919
I've got a new phone to Dr. Quist.

18:06.961 --> 18:09.005
Hold on a minute, please.

18:10.214 --> 18:13.009
Your through now.

18:13.926 --> 18:15.052
Hello?

18:15.261 --> 18:16.470
Hello!

18:16.762 --> 18:18.431
Dr. Quist?

18:18.681 --> 18:19.849
It's Dell!

18:19.890 --> 18:20.725
How are you?

18:20.766 --> 18:22.351
Fine, fine thank you.

18:22.476 --> 18:25.021
I've put the specimens on the ferry

18:25.021 --> 18:27.982
and you should get them
first thing in the morning.

18:28.149 --> 18:28.983
What you mean?

18:29.025 --> 18:30.109
Where are you?

18:30.318 --> 18:31.444
Still on Balfe?

18:31.694 --> 18:32.361
Why?

18:32.403 --> 18:35.031
<i>Uh, well I haven't got enough stuff yet.</i>

18:35.197 --> 18:37.867
I need some more gull's eggs.

18:37.908 --> 18:38.909
<i>Gull's eggs?</i>

18:39.285 --> 18:41.912
<i>But, I tell you, they're unlikely
to be affected anyway.</i>

18:41.996 --> 18:44.957
<i>Yes, I agree we can't
have 100 many of them.</i>

18:45.041 --> 18:47.752
<i>We need a good selection of eggs, I think.</i>

18:47.793 --> 18:49.253
Dell, what are ya talking about?

18:49.295 --> 18:51.297
I said that it...
Eh, quite, quite.

18:51.380 --> 18:54.925
So, I'll just stay on here
for a few days more, okay?

18:55.051 --> 18:55.968
Listen to me!

18:56.010 --> 18:56.469
What?

18:56.469 --> 18:57.345
<i>I said...</i>

18:57.345 --> 19:00.014
I'm sorry this line's gone very bad.
I had better ring off now.

19:00.264 --> 19:02.183
Bye, bye! Goodbye!

19:07.313 --> 19:10.858
It's strange, that whenever I say something
to Dr. Shaw that he doesn't want to hear

19:10.941 --> 19:12.818
telephone always breaks down.

20:02.326 --> 20:03.494
- Tom?
- Yeah?

20:04.120 --> 20:05.246
Can l come in?

20:05.287 --> 20:06.455
Eh, go to hell.

20:06.497 --> 20:07.123
You alright?

20:07.248 --> 20:09.458
<i>Told ya, I told ya, go to hell.</i>

20:25.141 --> 20:27.017
He didn't go, that doctor.

20:27.685 --> 20:29.895
Says he"ll stay a few days.

20:29.979 --> 20:31.147
What for?

20:31.480 --> 20:33.733
Collecting gull's eggs, he says.

20:33.899 --> 20:36.152
Find out what he's really after.

20:37.486 --> 20:38.946
I'll try.

20:40.030 --> 20:42.950
- Does your bucket need emptying?
- No!

20:47.788 --> 20:49.290
Pepper?

20:51.000 --> 20:52.001
What?

20:53.169 --> 20:55.421
My eyes are gone.

20:59.550 --> 21:02.303
It's the shutters. It's dark in here.

21:02.678 --> 21:03.804
No.

21:04.472 --> 21:07.183
<i>I can't get them to focus.</i>

21:09.769 --> 21:11.020
Oh God.

21:12.396 --> 21:13.522
What can we do?

21:13.564 --> 21:14.982
<i>I don't know!</i>

21:17.443 --> 21:18.611
Tom?

21:19.528 --> 21:21.822
You won't try and get out again, will ya?

21:23.991 --> 21:26.744
I'm trying not to, Betty.

22:10.830 --> 22:11.831
Hello.

22:23.092 --> 22:24.218
I say!

22:26.136 --> 22:28.305
We don't like that, you know.

22:28.389 --> 22:29.890
'Round here.

22:30.015 --> 22:31.016
I'm sorry?

22:31.225 --> 22:32.518
We don't like that.

22:32.685 --> 22:34.395
Taking people's likeness.

22:34.520 --> 22:36.105
I didn't know that.

22:36.397 --> 22:37.940
I'll ask next time.

22:38.023 --> 22:39.650
Mind you do.

22:39.984 --> 22:43.279
We don't like that sort of carry-on
at all, as a matter of fact.

22:44.238 --> 22:45.322
Okay.

23:05.342 --> 23:06.760
Hey boy! C'mon!

23:06.969 --> 23:08.053
C'mon boy!

23:22.776 --> 23:24.028
Hey, shoo!

23:24.111 --> 23:24.653
Shoo!

23:24.737 --> 23:25.529
Shoo!

23:25.613 --> 23:26.655
Shoo there!

23:27.448 --> 23:28.449
C'mon ya!

23:28.991 --> 23:29.992
Get out!

23:31.702 --> 23:32.703
Get out!

23:38.542 --> 23:40.252
Get out! Get out!

23:45.883 --> 23:47.968
Dang it! Get out!

25:51.133 --> 25:52.384
Come in.

25:59.224 --> 26:00.976
<i>What can I do for you, Dr. Shaw?</i>

26:01.060 --> 26:03.062
<i>Constable, I think you better come with me.</i>

26:03.145 --> 26:04.188
What's up?

26:04.521 --> 26:07.066
You know the, the wood near the Balfe?

26:07.107 --> 26:07.816
Aye.

26:07.858 --> 26:09.234
Well, there's a body there.

26:09.860 --> 26:10.903
Buried.

26:13.655 --> 26:14.573
Whose body?

26:14.656 --> 26:16.950
I don't know. It's a young girl
or a child. I'm not sure.

26:16.992 --> 26:17.993
Why not?

26:18.619 --> 26:19.369
Right.

26:19.411 --> 26:20.537
Let's go.

26:31.965 --> 26:33.175
Where's he going?

26:33.300 --> 26:34.551
Do you recognize him?

26:35.177 --> 26:36.470
Have you seen Al?

26:52.402 --> 26:53.403
Here.

26:54.071 --> 26:55.114
Right.

26:57.116 --> 26:58.992
Someone's been here.

26:59.034 --> 27:00.327
How do you mean?

27:08.001 --> 27:09.753
I left it uncovered.

27:09.920 --> 27:11.380
Well, there's nothing here.

27:11.421 --> 27:13.215
I told you someone's been here!

27:13.215 --> 27:15.717
Look you can see for yourself.
The ground's newly turned over.

27:15.843 --> 27:18.720
Well, we might as well make sure
now we've come all the way up here.

27:20.222 --> 27:22.349
Ah, there's nothing there. Forget it!

27:23.600 --> 27:25.978
Just what are you playing at, Dr. Shaw?

27:32.234 --> 27:33.485
Can ll come in?

27:34.444 --> 27:35.946
Oh, Dr. Shaw.

27:36.155 --> 27:37.447
Yes, come in.

27:37.948 --> 27:39.867
Would you mind calling me Dell?

27:40.242 --> 27:41.535
I need a friend.

27:43.829 --> 27:45.122
I thought you'd left.

27:45.455 --> 27:47.124
Couldn't tear myself away.

27:47.207 --> 27:49.168
They make one feel so welcome here.

27:49.710 --> 27:51.962
I'm sorry if I sound so busy.

27:53.005 --> 27:54.214
How are you, hmm?

27:55.048 --> 27:56.633
Why do you need a friend?

27:57.009 --> 27:59.636
I need someone to tell me
what's going on on this island.

27:59.636 --> 28:00.888
Not much.

28:01.138 --> 28:03.640
We don't get much excitement on Balfe.

28:03.849 --> 28:05.392
You could fool me.

28:05.475 --> 28:08.729
Do you know that whenever I leave the
confines of this village someone follows me?

28:08.770 --> 28:10.355
- Follows you?
- With a gun.

28:10.981 --> 28:12.983
I think you must be imagining things.

28:13.066 --> 28:16.069
That's what Constable Hartwell told me
when we didn't find the body.

28:16.987 --> 28:17.988
What body?

28:18.363 --> 28:20.490
I found a body buried in the woods.

28:20.532 --> 28:22.784
<i>But when I went back with
Hartwell, it was gone.</i>

28:22.826 --> 28:24.411
A child's body.

28:25.412 --> 28:27.831
He didn't believe me,
didn't seem much concerned.

28:28.457 --> 28:30.626
Dr. Shaw, what are you trying to imply?

28:30.667 --> 28:31.793
Imply?

28:31.919 --> 28:33.253
What do you think?

28:33.587 --> 28:36.423
I hoped that as an outsider
you might be able to help me.

28:36.506 --> 28:39.218
As an outsider who has to
live here and keep their trust.

28:39.259 --> 28:42.137
I more than anyone have
to respect the islander's wishes!

28:42.179 --> 28:44.598
Wishing? What the, what the hell
are these wishes?

28:44.681 --> 28:48.268
This island has enough trouble of its own
without you coming here and stirring up more!

28:48.310 --> 28:49.603
What troubles?

28:49.686 --> 28:51.188
Just leave them alone, Dr. Shaw.

28:51.396 --> 28:52.606
That's all they want.

28:52.689 --> 28:54.191
To be left alone.

29:04.910 --> 29:07.079
I don't think I can do that, you know?

29:21.969 --> 29:24.596
No Mrs. Straker! No and no!

29:25.013 --> 29:26.848
Something has got to be done.

29:28.809 --> 29:30.435
<i>Do you think I don't suffer, too?</i>

29:31.103 --> 29:32.479
<i>On, I know but...</i>

29:32.562 --> 29:34.314
Do you think I'm not with
you in your agony?

29:34.398 --> 29:35.816
It isn't that.

29:36.275 --> 29:37.693
Everyday.

29:37.776 --> 29:40.988
Mrs. Straker, everyday I'm faced with it.

29:41.071 --> 29:42.197
In my own house.

29:43.073 --> 29:44.074
Just as you are.

29:44.574 --> 29:46.243
But there are so many of us.

29:46.451 --> 29:47.995
So many of us, exactly.

29:48.161 --> 29:50.998
So many of us bound together by suffering.

29:51.164 --> 29:52.457
I know.

29:52.499 --> 29:53.625
I know.

29:55.752 --> 29:56.962
Oh, Reverend.

29:57.462 --> 29:59.423
What are we going to do?

30:00.674 --> 30:02.384
We have to be strong.

30:03.719 --> 30:04.970
Strong?

30:05.053 --> 30:06.847
The world is all we have.

30:08.473 --> 30:09.474
But...

30:09.725 --> 30:11.351
Shouldn't we call a doctor?

30:11.518 --> 30:12.978
No doctors!

30:13.020 --> 30:14.896
What harm could a doctor do?

30:14.896 --> 30:18.734
And what good? What do achieve by
thwarting the will of the Almighty?

30:19.901 --> 30:22.821
We are puny. We are as nothing
before him, Mrs. Straker.

30:22.863 --> 30:24.031
Never forget that .

30:24.197 --> 30:26.074
<i>I know, I know ll...</i>

30:26.074 --> 30:29.202
I do, but with a doctor here on the island?

30:29.202 --> 30:31.288
We must be on our guard even more.

30:31.330 --> 30:33.040
But maybe we should tell him.

30:33.123 --> 30:36.043
Maybe that's part of God's plan,
sending him here.

30:36.251 --> 30:39.254
You think he moves in
such trivial, mundane ways?

30:39.755 --> 30:41.965
You're a good woman, Mrs. Straker, but...

30:41.965 --> 30:45.385
Besides, think of the unhappiness
any such action would cause.

30:45.427 --> 30:47.137
Think of the worries.

30:47.220 --> 30:49.097
And your husband. -Mrs. Straker!

30:55.103 --> 30:55.771
Oh.

30:55.896 --> 30:57.314
Dr. Shaw.

30:57.356 --> 30:59.900
<i>I just wanted to use the phone,
if that's alright?</i>

31:00.901 --> 31:02.444
The vicar's using is at the moment.

31:02.611 --> 31:04.363
It's all, all finished.

31:04.863 --> 31:06.865
Have a good day, Mrs. Straker.

31:25.801 --> 31:28.428
He seems very much
part of the community here.

31:28.512 --> 31:29.262
Yes.

31:29.388 --> 31:30.680
How long has he been here?

31:30.931 --> 31:31.932
Years.

31:32.641 --> 31:33.683
Since the war.

31:33.767 --> 31:36.561
<i>Yes, I suppose if someone spends
a long time in a small community</i>

31:36.561 --> 31:38.563
they get a bit set in
their ways, don't they?

31:39.940 --> 31:42.401
His ways are our ways, Dr. Shaw.

31:45.654 --> 31:49.366
Go as he goes, I'm sure he administers
to your spiritual needs excellently.

31:49.366 --> 31:51.034
How about your more physical needs?

31:51.118 --> 31:52.119
How do you mean?

31:52.160 --> 31:54.538
Where's the nearest hospital?
On the mainland?

31:56.581 --> 31:59.167
Oh, we're, we're a healthy lot on Balfe.

31:59.251 --> 32:02.170
I'm sure, but what happens if someone
falls ill... - Excuse me Dr. Shaw.

32:02.712 --> 32:03.797
I have work to do.

32:25.193 --> 32:27.446
Uh, another one from the north shore.

32:32.159 --> 32:33.368
Oh, Dr. Quist.

32:33.410 --> 32:34.119
Yes.

32:34.119 --> 32:37.289
<i>John and I have been working those
samples Dell sent up from Balfe.</i>

32:37.330 --> 32:38.748
Completely new to me.

32:38.832 --> 32:41.001
Any sign of damage from
the oil or detergent?

32:41.001 --> 32:43.795
No, just the opposite. Everything seems
just a sight too healthy.

32:44.004 --> 32:45.046
And that's bad?

32:45.088 --> 32:48.508
I don't know about good
or bad, but it's peculiar.

32:49.092 --> 32:52.220
It's the plankton clouding
the sea water that started it.

32:52.304 --> 32:54.055
We did a count of the phytoplankton.

32:54.139 --> 32:55.182
That's a plant.

32:55.223 --> 32:57.142
Over eight percent up, on average.

32:57.184 --> 32:58.393
That's peculiar.

32:59.019 --> 33:00.020
Go on.

33:00.645 --> 33:01.730
Well...

33:02.189 --> 33:04.900
if we averaged out the density
of the plankton and the seawater

33:04.941 --> 33:07.194
he sent in, it works out at something like

33:07.360 --> 33:08.945
three tons to the acre.

33:09.029 --> 33:10.280
That's a lot, isn't it?

33:10.322 --> 33:11.948
Well, in a year

33:12.157 --> 33:15.202
and a good one, you might get
five tons to the acre produced.

33:15.535 --> 33:18.997
To get three tons to the acre
in such a short time, well

33:19.039 --> 33:20.081
it's too much.

33:20.165 --> 33:21.958
What about the animal plankton?

33:22.334 --> 33:23.752
Well, that's up, too.

33:23.793 --> 33:25.086
But in a different way.

33:25.420 --> 33:26.796
There's not much of it.

33:26.963 --> 33:29.508
But all the species are a bit-oversized.

33:31.510 --> 33:32.969
Get on to Dell

33:33.094 --> 33:34.387
tell him the results

33:34.721 --> 33:37.849
and get him to send up some
fish from around the island.

35:51.274 --> 35:54.277
Are you alright? You be careful.

35:57.489 --> 35:59.324
Don't you be long in there.

36:16.007 --> 36:17.509
Okay, let's go.

38:49.994 --> 38:50.995
Who?

38:51.204 --> 38:53.206
Who's there, huh?

39:28.658 --> 39:29.492
Oh no!

39:29.576 --> 39:32.996
Stop it, you'll kill him!

39:40.670 --> 39:43.965
Alright now? Are you Dr. Shaw?

39:44.424 --> 39:46.342
Shaw?

39:48.344 --> 39:50.013
Dr. Shaw?

39:50.054 --> 39:51.347
Are you alright?

39:58.479 --> 39:59.772
Are you alright?

39:59.981 --> 40:00.982
Uh.

40:01.274 --> 40:02.650
Hello.

40:03.610 --> 40:04.986
Victoria.

40:09.282 --> 40:11.326
<i>How you didn't kill yourself, I don't know.</i>

40:11.409 --> 40:13.161
Eh, kill myself?

40:13.369 --> 40:15.788
Yes, you were found lying by the beach.

40:17.540 --> 40:19.125
Lying on the beach?

40:19.125 --> 40:20.126
Yes.

40:20.168 --> 40:21.711
What were you doing there?

40:21.920 --> 40:23.004
Can you remember?

40:23.129 --> 40:24.172
Yes.

40:24.505 --> 40:25.882
- I was in the barn..
- You should lie still.

40:25.924 --> 40:27.216
<i>Like hell I will.</i>

40:27.717 --> 40:29.135
Who found me anyway?

40:29.177 --> 40:31.346
Dick Voy, now did he, um

40:31.512 --> 40:34.390
he had some lobster pots set by the point.

40:35.350 --> 40:38.019
Oh, and Mrs. Straker had
a telephone message for you.

40:38.102 --> 40:40.104
It was something about fish.

40:50.406 --> 40:51.741
Does it make any sense to you?

40:51.824 --> 40:53.034
Hmmm.

40:53.368 --> 40:54.410
It's beginning to.

41:26.693 --> 41:29.946
I'm not mad. There was someone
in here last night who attacked me.

41:33.199 --> 41:34.283
Hmmmm...

41:36.035 --> 41:37.203
Look!

41:37.704 --> 41:39.455
Beggar probably left them.

41:40.498 --> 41:42.667
You got a lot of beggars in this island?

41:43.042 --> 41:44.043
No.

41:46.337 --> 41:47.672
Victoria.

41:48.840 --> 41:51.467
Listen, will you help me or won't you?

41:52.176 --> 41:54.345
I can't do anything that
will harm the islanders.

41:54.387 --> 41:56.973
Now, why should I want
to harm the islanders?

41:57.765 --> 41:59.183
I don't know.

41:59.434 --> 42:01.102
Well, you might not want to

42:01.227 --> 42:03.104
but I don't know what you want to do.

42:03.146 --> 42:05.356
<i>First, I want information.</i>

42:06.357 --> 42:09.027
There's something wrong on
the island, isn't there?

42:20.038 --> 42:21.039
Yes.

42:21.998 --> 42:23.458
<i>Yes, I think there is.</i>

42:25.334 --> 42:26.586
Well, what is it?

42:26.627 --> 42:27.670
I don't know.

42:27.837 --> 42:29.839
That's the truth. I don't know.

42:31.132 --> 42:32.842
Well, some of the people have...

42:33.217 --> 42:35.136
Well, they've disappeared.

42:35.261 --> 42:36.971
You mean they're dead?

42:37.055 --> 42:37.847
No.

42:37.972 --> 42:39.599
They just stay in their houses.

42:41.059 --> 42:43.227
And the men, they've
started fighting with each other.

42:43.352 --> 42:45.354
<i>Yes, I saw one in the pub yesterday.</i>

42:46.314 --> 42:48.274
It's very difficult to
understand what it is.

42:48.357 --> 42:51.110
There's just a general air of
secretiveness about them.

42:53.571 --> 42:55.531
You see, I'm in a very difficult position.

42:56.324 --> 42:57.742
I do want to help them.

42:58.367 --> 42:59.911
<i>But I don't want to intrude.</i>

43:00.286 --> 43:02.747
Will you help me if it doesn't intrude?

43:02.997 --> 43:03.831
Yes.

43:03.956 --> 43:05.124
<i>Yes, of course I will.</i>

43:07.001 --> 43:08.127
What do you need?

43:08.419 --> 43:10.421
- I need to catch some fish.
- Fish?

43:10.463 --> 43:12.173
<i>Kind? I don't understand.</i>

43:12.173 --> 43:13.424
Join the club.

43:13.508 --> 43:15.468
Is there a fisherman in the
island who would help us?

43:15.510 --> 43:16.552
Uh, no.

43:16.803 --> 43:18.721
<i>No, but I have a friend on the mainland.</i>

43:18.805 --> 43:19.889
Bob Gillett.

43:20.014 --> 43:21.015
He will.

43:26.395 --> 43:28.856
<i>Bob, I think we've got
enough now, thank you.</i>

43:29.440 --> 43:31.150
Oh, that's ok with me.

43:33.569 --> 43:35.863
Is this young halibut or what?

43:36.531 --> 43:38.324
No, it's terpit, isn't Bob?

43:38.449 --> 43:39.867
That's right, terpit.

43:40.409 --> 43:42.578
They never grow to that size!

43:42.620 --> 43:43.913
Well, they do 'round here.

43:44.038 --> 43:46.374
Oh yes, the fish 'round here are marvelous.

43:46.457 --> 43:47.291
Big?

43:47.458 --> 43:50.461
Oh enormous! You wouldn't see
them like that in London.

43:51.462 --> 43:53.798
They're not sent to market then, huh?

43:54.799 --> 43:56.509
No they're just sold locally.

43:56.592 --> 43:58.177
On Balfre, mainly.

44:03.975 --> 44:05.017
What's this?

44:06.352 --> 44:07.562
Castle Rock.

44:07.687 --> 44:09.272
Prohibited area.

44:09.897 --> 44:11.065
Oh, why?

44:11.732 --> 44:12.692
Who knows?

44:12.733 --> 44:14.235
They don't tell ya, do they?

44:14.986 --> 44:16.529
Can we get a bit closer?

44:16.737 --> 44:17.738
Sure.

44:28.374 --> 44:31.002
What happened here?
This isn't where the tanker was sunk.

44:31.294 --> 44:32.295
No.

44:32.587 --> 44:34.422
No, that was the other side of the island.

44:34.505 --> 44:36.883
No, this has been a prohibited area for...

44:37.008 --> 44:38.718
eight or nine year now.

44:38.801 --> 44:39.927
Really?

45:07.538 --> 45:09.832
Oh, we've got the minister
on the run this time.

45:09.916 --> 45:12.960
And admitting after much
arguing that the Royal Navy

45:13.044 --> 45:16.422
used the Castle Rock area
as a dumping ground up til six years ago.

45:16.464 --> 45:17.590
Dumping what?

45:17.757 --> 45:19.008
Oh, that they wouldn't say.

45:19.091 --> 45:21.093
Interest of national security.

45:21.260 --> 45:23.596
Not in the public interest
at the present time.

45:23.679 --> 45:26.557
- Not the policy of this department.
- Listen, they're playing our tune.

45:27.934 --> 45:29.060
Oh, what's in the fish?

45:29.060 --> 45:30.311
- Have a look a this?
- Hm?

45:32.188 --> 45:34.148
Four parts per million of what?

45:34.565 --> 45:36.859
Well, it's a protein of sorts.

45:37.610 --> 45:39.737
It's almost like a
pituitary growth hormone.

45:39.904 --> 45:40.947
But it's not.

45:41.113 --> 45:42.949
The molecules have been mucked about.

45:43.199 --> 45:46.661
How the hell could pituitary
growth hormone get into fish?

45:47.119 --> 45:49.080
Oh, I think you better ask the navy that.

45:53.251 --> 45:54.418
Yes?

45:55.628 --> 45:57.171
Dr. Shaw, sir.

45:58.714 --> 46:00.216
Oh, Dr. Shaw.

46:01.175 --> 46:03.803
<i>I've been fold that I should see you.</i>

46:03.886 --> 46:05.388
But not why.

46:06.055 --> 46:09.809
For the life of me, I can't see how
I can help you "Doomsday" people.

46:10.226 --> 46:11.727
Let me explain, sir.

46:11.936 --> 46:15.022
We've come across some
chemically contaminated fish.

46:15.231 --> 46:18.901
And we've got a fairly strong idea
that they come from a prohibited zone

46:18.901 --> 46:21.445
in your area. It's a
place called Castle Rock

46:21.445 --> 46:23.197
on Balfe.

46:23.656 --> 46:25.032
Castle Rock?

46:26.534 --> 46:27.827
Oh let's see now

46:27.868 --> 46:29.704
that's near Wimbrough, isn't it?

46:30.413 --> 46:31.998
Oh, yes, here it is.

46:32.081 --> 46:33.291
Castle Rock.

46:34.542 --> 46:36.752
But people can't fish there.

46:36.836 --> 46:38.754
It's a prohibited area.

46:38.921 --> 46:42.466
The place is perfectly
well-marked with warning buoys.

46:42.883 --> 46:46.762
The fish might feed there and still be
caught outside the prohibited area.

46:47.138 --> 46:50.099
I just want to find out, sir,
exactly what is down there.

46:50.349 --> 46:51.559
Oh, alright.

46:51.600 --> 46:52.518
Well, sit down.

46:52.518 --> 46:54.937
Tavina, will you bring the file?

46:55.062 --> 46:56.564
Is that really necessary, sir?

46:56.689 --> 46:57.898
What do you mean?

46:58.357 --> 47:01.444
I understand from our file

47:01.485 --> 47:05.281
well, that you were in charge of the inter-service
ordinance team in the area at the time

47:05.323 --> 47:07.742
and you were responsible
for the dumping yourself.

47:08.826 --> 47:11.787
I don't know that I care
for your imputation, doctor.

47:12.204 --> 47:13.039
I'll 'Uh...

47:13.164 --> 47:14.332
just get the file, sir.

47:14.623 --> 47:15.624
Alright.

47:17.418 --> 47:18.210
Sir Jeffrey.

47:18.377 --> 47:20.921
I'm not concerned with past history.

47:21.047 --> 47:24.550
I'm only concerned with the effects
of this dump on the people of Balfre and

47:24.550 --> 47:26.218
on the fish that feed in the area.

47:26.385 --> 47:28.387
Alright, but you are on the wrong track.

47:28.596 --> 47:32.308
Nothing even remotely dangerous
was dumped off Castle Rock.

47:32.475 --> 47:34.143
Then why is fishing prohibited there?

47:34.185 --> 47:35.895
Not my decision, really.

47:36.479 --> 47:40.232
But in any case,
what chemical did you find in the fish?

47:40.399 --> 47:44.111
It appears to be a hormone
similar to pituitary growth hormone.

47:44.403 --> 47:46.197
<i>Now I know that you're on the wrong track</i>

47:46.280 --> 47:50.409
unless you can make pituitary
what-not out of mildly radioactive waste.

47:52.787 --> 47:54.497
Only radioactive waste?

47:54.997 --> 47:56.457
That's all.

47:57.750 --> 47:59.627
Only radioactive waste?

47:59.752 --> 48:00.795
That's all.

48:01.003 --> 48:03.547
I've been through our file
with a fine-tooth comb.

48:03.631 --> 48:05.049
It's all about Borden.

48:05.508 --> 48:08.803
It says here these casks are corrosion
proof for one hundred fifty years.

48:08.844 --> 48:10.763
And I'm always inclined to
mistrust that sort of claim.

48:10.763 --> 48:11.764
I'm ready of it.

48:16.435 --> 48:18.646
How much of the fish extract did you give?

48:19.021 --> 48:20.439
Well, these two are litter mates.

48:20.773 --> 48:22.566
The one on the left had nothing

48:23.234 --> 48:26.362
and the other one had
a hundred milligrams of the extract

48:26.404 --> 48:28.197
inter-muscularly exactly

48:29.281 --> 48:30.658
seventy minutes ago.

48:30.866 --> 48:32.451
Poor little sod.

48:32.493 --> 48:33.494
I wouldn't if I were you.

48:44.422 --> 48:46.340
Eh, just a hundred milligrams?

48:47.800 --> 48:48.884
How long will it last?

48:48.968 --> 48:50.386
I'll give it a sedative in a minute.

48:50.428 --> 48:54.432
Shh, shh, c'mon puppy dog,
that's enough. Shh, shh.

48:54.473 --> 48:55.474
Shh.

48:56.016 --> 49:00.062
This dog reminds me of the dog
that attacked me in the woods.

49:00.604 --> 49:02.189
It's the same violence.

49:02.565 --> 49:03.899
Yes, go on.

49:07.570 --> 49:11.991
I wonder if this could explain
the odd atmosphere on that island.

49:12.992 --> 49:14.952
The outbreaks of violence.

49:16.078 --> 49:16.787
Hey.

49:16.996 --> 49:19.248
Yes. -
What happens if you feed people

49:19.290 --> 49:21.917
large doses of pituitary hormone?

49:22.668 --> 49:24.920
By mouth, nothing.
The stomach can't absorb it.

49:25.045 --> 49:26.088
You'd have to inject it.

49:26.130 --> 49:28.549
Yeah, but this isn't just
ordinary pituitary hormone.

49:28.549 --> 49:30.718
When the molecules have
been mucked around, remember?

49:30.759 --> 49:33.679
The sort of thing we've just seen
you don't get from any hormone.

49:34.054 --> 49:37.224
Yeah, but you see maybe
the molecules have been rearranged...

49:37.349 --> 49:39.268
to make it digestible.

49:39.393 --> 49:40.769
This had the side effect.

49:41.061 --> 49:42.062
Yes.

49:42.271 --> 49:43.522
I see what you mean.

49:43.731 --> 49:48.569
What if adults did somehow
absorb pituitary growth hormone?

49:49.361 --> 49:51.197
Then you would eventually get...

49:52.323 --> 49:53.324
acromegaly.

49:53.365 --> 49:55.576
Exactly! I didn't get the connection.

49:55.743 --> 49:58.078
I mean, how can you get
an epidemic of acromegaly?

49:58.287 --> 50:01.957
Acromegaly is only caused by the
over functioning of the pituitary gland.

50:02.333 --> 50:03.667
So, you can't.

50:04.543 --> 50:07.463
Unless the hormone is
introduced from outside.

50:07.505 --> 50:09.048
But the people on Balfe could have it.

50:09.840 --> 50:11.675
That strange look I told you about.

50:11.842 --> 50:14.053
The prognathous jaw, though,
the hanging brows

50:14.053 --> 50:16.597
and its last stages,
like the poor bastard who attacked me.

50:16.722 --> 50:17.723
Acromegaly.

50:17.806 --> 50:18.307
Yeah.

50:18.516 --> 50:21.435
Which are due to be just some
form of family likeness, you know.

50:21.435 --> 50:22.978
Centuries of inbreeding.

50:23.604 --> 50:26.315
And we must remember there's
no doctor resident on the island

50:26.315 --> 50:27.858
who might detect acromegaly.

50:27.942 --> 50:31.695
But there isn't any hormone, for god sake.
All there is is radioactive waste.

50:32.029 --> 50:33.697
That's something we gotta be sure about.

50:36.116 --> 50:37.117
John...

50:37.159 --> 50:39.036
can you go down and get
pictures of the dump?

50:39.078 --> 50:40.996
Alright, if you can get
another with a camera.

50:41.205 --> 50:41.956
Right.

50:42.039 --> 50:44.708
You and Dell get back
to Balfe and get those pictures.

50:45.334 --> 50:47.711
- I'll get a chopper to take us down, right?
- Okay.

50:47.753 --> 50:49.672
And I'm gonna get on with the minister.

50:52.383 --> 50:54.134
Well, there it is.

50:54.218 --> 50:55.469
Castle Rock.

50:57.346 --> 50:59.306
Make sure you photograph everything.

51:00.933 --> 51:02.142
Well, here we go, huh?

51:02.268 --> 51:04.728
I just stop. This isn't
a minefield, that's all.

51:04.812 --> 51:07.439
No sense of adventure,
that's your trouble, Bob.

54:11.749 --> 54:12.750
Is this the one?

54:22.426 --> 54:23.469
Thank you.

54:24.553 --> 54:26.388
Ah, Dell, how are you?

54:27.890 --> 54:28.974
How'd it go?

54:29.016 --> 54:30.142
Couldn't be better.

54:30.142 --> 54:31.852
And John didn't drown himself?

54:31.894 --> 54:33.103
No such luck.

54:34.271 --> 54:35.397
Well, where to next?

54:35.522 --> 54:37.566
<i>Our old friend, the Admiral,
I think. Don't you?</i>

54:37.608 --> 54:38.817
I can't wait.

54:39.234 --> 54:41.945
Any luck pinning down
exactly what's in those fish?

54:42.029 --> 54:44.782
We can't get enough out
of them for proper analysis.

54:45.199 --> 54:49.828
Could the Navy be dumping vast
quantities of hormone off Castle Rock?

54:49.912 --> 54:51.038
What for?

54:51.497 --> 54:55.459
I can't think what the Navy would want with
pituitary growth hormones in the first place.

54:55.834 --> 54:59.463
Right. Probably our trip to
Portsmouth will provide the answer.

54:59.797 --> 55:01.423
I certainly hope so.

55:15.312 --> 55:19.691
Anyway, the Admiral was mildly upset
by what he described as your ''inuendos.''

55:20.984 --> 55:22.444
Only mildly?

55:22.736 --> 55:24.655
I must be losing my grip then.

55:24.696 --> 55:27.950
I thought I better come along this time
to referee the encounter.

55:28.408 --> 55:29.743
You may well be needed.

55:30.369 --> 55:32.955
The Admiral's going to have
some explaining to do.

55:34.498 --> 55:36.959
<i>I hear that I'm mildly
unpopular with you, sir.</i>

55:37.501 --> 55:41.630
I thought your manner left something
to be desired the last time we met, yes.

55:42.256 --> 55:45.843
It always lets me down, I'm afraid,
but, you see, it's sometimes justified.

55:48.011 --> 55:49.388
What are these?

55:49.805 --> 55:52.057
Pictures of your underwater dump off Balfe.

55:52.266 --> 55:53.684
Castle Rock.

55:54.142 --> 55:56.645
Castle Rock is a prohibited area.

55:56.895 --> 55:58.063
Who took these?

55:58.313 --> 56:02.025
Friend, of mine sir, I'm afraid he was
underwater so he didn't see the signs.

56:04.319 --> 56:07.030
Yes, these are they. These are ours.

56:07.406 --> 56:08.782
And these?

56:10.868 --> 56:11.577
What's that?

56:11.660 --> 56:14.955
That's what I hope you'll be able to tell
us. It's certainly not radioactive waste.

56:15.998 --> 56:18.625
You can see better on, on this one.

56:19.042 --> 56:20.961
Well, these are nothing
to do with the Navy.

56:21.044 --> 56:23.714
Well, how do you account for their presence.
There's hundreds of the things down there.

56:23.714 --> 56:27.092
They must have been dumped after
our operation. They're quite unauthorized.

56:27.134 --> 56:27.968
What's in them?

56:28.051 --> 56:29.344
That's what we gotta find out.

56:29.595 --> 56:31.638
There's a number on this canister.

56:32.347 --> 56:34.683
Do you think this could be checked somehow?

56:35.017 --> 56:36.018
We hope so, sir.

57:00.918 --> 57:02.920
There are two things you
have to do on the island.

57:04.880 --> 57:07.758
Try and find out how many people
are affected is the first.

57:07.841 --> 57:09.635
And the second is even more difficult.

57:10.302 --> 57:12.971
You've got to explain to these people
what's been happening to them

57:13.180 --> 57:15.015
and then try to restore their morale.

57:15.057 --> 57:18.852
That's problematical until we know exactly what
we're going to do to be able to help them.

57:18.894 --> 57:20.312
Do the best you can.

57:20.687 --> 57:21.772
Don't forget

57:22.022 --> 57:23.398
you're all they've got at present.

57:37.496 --> 57:38.956
! wonder what he's doing here.

57:40.624 --> 57:42.542
<i>Oh, I was just coming to see you, Vicar.</i>

57:42.668 --> 57:43.251
Oh?

57:43.335 --> 57:44.711
<i>Yes, I wonder if you can help me?</i>

57:46.421 --> 57:49.967
<i>- In what way?
- Well, I want to get the islanders together for a meeting.</i>

57:50.050 --> 57:51.134
All the islanders.

57:51.218 --> 57:54.096
I thought the church would be
a convenient and appropriate place.

57:54.179 --> 57:56.598
Indeed, I hope that you
will talk to them yourself.

57:56.848 --> 57:57.849
Talk?

57:57.933 --> 57:59.267
About what?

57:59.893 --> 58:02.437
Well, to put it bluntly,
there are a lot of people on

58:02.479 --> 58:05.357
this island suffering from a
disease called “acromegaly.”

58:06.191 --> 58:07.067
Disease?

58:07.109 --> 58:09.820
Yes, it's a disease caused
by exposure to a hormone.

58:10.696 --> 58:12.990
- I doubt that doctor.
- What do you mean?

58:14.116 --> 58:16.034
The islanders here, you know,

58:16.118 --> 58:18.870
they've lived a closed life for centuries.

58:18.912 --> 58:20.664
Life of inbreeding, and

58:20.747 --> 58:21.707
immorality.

58:21.748 --> 58:26.169
Yes, yeah that first crossed my mind, but
we now have definite proof of this disease.

58:26.336 --> 58:28.964
Perhaps you would enlighten me, Doctor.

58:29.589 --> 58:31.341
How is this disease contracted?

58:31.842 --> 58:35.470
We think its probably caused by
eating fish contaminated by the hormone.

58:35.721 --> 58:36.847
I see...

58:37.681 --> 58:41.560
And how do you account for the fact
that the disease is so selective?

58:41.810 --> 58:43.729
Striking one person and not his neighbor.

58:43.812 --> 58:45.147
One man and not his brother.

58:45.230 --> 58:47.983
Probably because one man
eats more fish than another.

58:48.984 --> 58:50.902
That explanation satisfies you, does it?

58:50.944 --> 58:52.696
Yes, it's the only reasonable one.

58:52.779 --> 58:53.613
Ah.

58:53.697 --> 58:55.157
The voice of science.

58:55.866 --> 58:57.576
I'm afraid we have nothing

58:57.826 --> 58:59.578
more to say to each other.

59:00.245 --> 59:01.580
Good day, Doctor.

59:06.001 --> 59:07.252
I always wish

59:08.211 --> 59:09.963
you were right, you know?

01:00:02.432 --> 01:00:03.225
Well?

01:00:03.266 --> 01:00:05.560
You've really put the cat
among the pigeons this time.

01:00:05.602 --> 01:00:06.394
What's happening?

01:00:06.436 --> 01:00:08.772
Well, after the request for
information you sent out...

01:00:08.814 --> 01:00:11.191
everybody's been making
spot-checks on their fish...

01:00:11.191 --> 01:00:13.068
and found it packed full of the stuff.

01:00:13.110 --> 01:00:15.028
And these are where the
reports have come from?

01:00:15.112 --> 01:00:16.113
Yes.

01:00:16.196 --> 01:00:19.282
Apparently the French have
protested to the British government.

01:00:19.324 --> 01:00:20.408
Oh, that's standard.

01:00:20.492 --> 01:00:22.702
And the Minister has been
trying to reach you all day.

01:00:22.828 --> 01:00:23.912
John spoke to him.

01:00:24.079 --> 01:00:24.830
And?

01:00:24.871 --> 01:00:27.999
There should be no right to divulge
such information to a foreign power.

01:00:28.083 --> 01:00:29.543
What an opportunist, the man is.

01:00:29.584 --> 01:00:31.378
<i>I didn't divulge anything anyway.</i>

01:00:31.419 --> 01:00:32.879
I merely asked for information.

01:00:32.921 --> 01:00:36.007
Well, the good news is we have
traced the index marking on the canisters.

01:00:36.341 --> 01:00:38.135
And they come from Doran Chemicals.

01:00:38.218 --> 01:00:38.844
Doran?

01:00:38.969 --> 01:00:41.972
Eh, Doran Chemicals Limited,
Chairman Sir Henry Leyton.

01:00:51.022 --> 01:00:52.190
Triflimide?

01:00:52.232 --> 01:00:54.151
A well educated nose, Dr. Ridge.

01:00:59.739 --> 01:01:01.491
Well, I'll just get Sir Henry for you.

01:01:07.122 --> 01:01:09.791
Sir Henry, there's a Dr. Ridge
from Doomwatch to see you.

01:01:20.886 --> 01:01:23.013
Well, well, well, Dr. Ridge. Good morning.

01:01:23.096 --> 01:01:23.847
Morning.

01:01:23.930 --> 01:01:25.348
How's my old friend, Quist?

01:01:25.724 --> 01:01:27.601
I'm sorry I didn't know
you knew each other.

01:01:27.642 --> 01:01:30.562
<i>Oh, I expect “friend” is 100 strong a word.
We were at Oxford together.</i>

01:01:30.729 --> 01:01:32.856
Mad bugger, he was, like
all mathematicians.

01:01:32.981 --> 01:01:34.274
<i>Well, what can I do for ya?</i>

01:01:34.441 --> 01:01:36.735
Well, uh... - I'm not in trouble
with you fellas, I trust.

01:01:36.735 --> 01:01:38.820
<i>- Oh no, I don't think so.
- Thank heavens for that.</i>

01:01:38.904 --> 01:01:41.656
The amount we spent on
anti-pollution procedures...

01:01:41.656 --> 01:01:44.826
Just making some general inquiries into hormone
production. I know you make a lot of them.

01:01:44.826 --> 01:01:45.952
Oh yes, any amount.

01:01:45.994 --> 01:01:48.872
Thyroxine, adrenalin,
estrogen, progesterone.

01:01:48.914 --> 01:01:51.583
What about pituitary growth hormone?

01:01:54.669 --> 01:01:57.964
As you can see, we've always
geared ourselves to bulk production.

01:01:58.131 --> 01:02:00.425
We leave it to the small specialist firms...

01:02:00.467 --> 01:02:03.762
to turn out the stuff that can
only be produced a milligram at a time.

01:02:03.845 --> 01:02:08.350
We'd heard rumors that you'd found a way of
producing it in very large quantities, indeed.

01:02:08.433 --> 01:02:11.228
Oh, you should never listen
to rumors Dr. Ridge.

01:02:11.269 --> 01:02:13.355
I never do. Make it a rule.

01:02:13.563 --> 01:02:15.899
<i>- Don't I, David?
- Absolutely, Sir Henry.</i>

01:02:16.316 --> 01:02:17.817
Well, let's go inside.

01:02:26.284 --> 01:02:28.411
If you'll take a look at these.

01:02:30.413 --> 01:02:31.331
What are these?

01:02:31.414 --> 01:02:32.791
They're your canisters, Sir Henry.

01:02:34.709 --> 01:02:37.420
- Is this ours, David?
- The serial numbers have been traced to you.

01:02:38.004 --> 01:02:40.715
Oh, putting out your trust
in serial numbers, Dr. Ridge.

01:02:40.799 --> 01:02:42.842
Look, check on these
canisters, will you David?

01:02:42.842 --> 01:02:44.928
There's obviously been a
cock-up somewhere.

01:02:44.928 --> 01:02:46.888
Um, come and have a look at the model.

01:02:51.977 --> 01:02:52.978
Now, look Sir Henry...

01:02:53.186 --> 01:02:54.729
Can we stop playing games?

01:02:54.729 --> 01:02:56.982
- Oh, now, there...
- These canisters are yours.

01:02:57.274 --> 01:02:58.775
They've been dumped in the sea.

01:02:58.858 --> 01:03:02.028
And something very like pituitary
growth hormone is escaping from them.

01:03:02.070 --> 01:03:03.488
That shouldn't do much harm.

01:03:03.571 --> 01:03:05.824
Neutralize with the sea water
in a couple of hours.

01:03:06.241 --> 01:03:09.077
Old Mother Nature has a way of
dealing with these things, Dr. Ridge.

01:03:09.661 --> 01:03:13.206
That's what you...you doom
and disaster fellas oughta realize.

01:03:13.290 --> 01:03:17.043
Unfortunately, Old Mother Nature's been
nobbled in this case, as you well know.

01:03:17.627 --> 01:03:19.129
This stuff's been specially prepared.

01:03:19.379 --> 01:03:21.047
Probably to be taken orally.

01:03:21.298 --> 01:03:22.757
The local fish are cram full of it.

01:03:23.758 --> 01:03:25.051
Now, why should anyone do that?

01:03:25.427 --> 01:03:27.178
I can think of a number of reasons.

01:03:27.429 --> 01:03:30.890
Livestock feed additive is
the first thing that springs to mind.

01:03:33.893 --> 01:03:36.813
Oh, you're too cute for us,
Dr. Ridge, you really are.

01:03:37.230 --> 01:03:40.317
Yes, indeed we did experiment with
and for a time produce...

01:03:40.483 --> 01:03:43.278
a pituitary growth hormone
for the very purpose you describe.

01:03:43.361 --> 01:03:44.529
Livestock feed additive.

01:03:45.113 --> 01:03:46.114
And?

01:03:46.489 --> 01:03:48.408
In small quantities, we could do it.

01:03:48.867 --> 01:03:50.327
It was very exciting.

01:03:50.702 --> 01:03:54.372
Added to the feed of bullocks, it increased
their growth rate by thirty percent.

01:03:54.914 --> 01:03:56.166
In their first year of life.

01:03:56.291 --> 01:03:57.083
Oh, God.

01:03:57.167 --> 01:03:58.168
Kind.

01:03:58.918 --> 01:04:01.087
Hi, David. Well, you can speak freely.

01:04:01.963 --> 01:04:04.382
I'm quite sure Dr. Ridge
is one of these, uh...

01:04:04.466 --> 01:04:07.427
industrial spies that
we read so much about.

01:04:08.053 --> 01:04:10.972
Well, sir, the canister were RPGH.

01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:13.058
And who dumped it. Our usual people?

01:04:13.183 --> 01:04:14.267
Uh, no.

01:04:14.517 --> 01:04:17.979
As a matter of fact, as it was an important
operation, we put it out to tender.

01:04:18.021 --> 01:04:19.773
And you gave the job to the lowest bidder.

01:04:19.939 --> 01:04:21.191
They were a reputable firm.

01:04:21.274 --> 01:04:22.734
Until they were found out.

01:04:22.901 --> 01:04:26.446
They gave you a low bid because they were
going to dump it in their own backyard.

01:04:29.074 --> 01:04:30.408
What went wrong with the stuff?

01:04:31.659 --> 01:04:33.078
We don't really know.

01:04:33.411 --> 01:04:36.456
But for some reason, whenever
we tried to produce it in bulk...

01:04:36.998 --> 01:04:38.917
the molecular structure broke up.

01:04:39.542 --> 01:04:42.253
It was still ingestible, but
after a period of months...

01:04:42.837 --> 01:04:44.672
the animals were in a pitiable state.

01:04:45.548 --> 01:04:46.758
Quite uncontrollable.

01:04:47.675 --> 01:04:49.469
The seem to produce another kind of...

01:04:50.637 --> 01:04:52.180
kind of frenzy.

01:05:12.992 --> 01:05:14.411
Let me through!

01:05:14.536 --> 01:05:17.038
Let me through! I'm a doctor!
Please, let me through.

01:05:17.205 --> 01:05:19.874
Get away! Get away from him!
Hey, you get away!

01:05:19.999 --> 01:05:22.752
- Go away, leave us alone.
- There's nothing you can do, Doctor.

01:05:22.794 --> 01:05:24.963
- You go. Go.
- Now come out of there!

01:05:25.255 --> 01:05:28.007
C'mon now. There's nothing
you can do, Doctor.

01:05:28.133 --> 01:05:29.676
It's old Mr. Murray.

01:05:30.135 --> 01:05:31.136
He's dead.

01:05:34.556 --> 01:05:37.600
Stand back. Go get a
blanket now. Put it over him.

01:05:58.037 --> 01:06:02.041
<i>Alright now, that's enough of what
you've done. C'mon now. Get moving now!</i>

01:06:02.083 --> 01:06:04.752
Get off the street. C'mon now,
or I'll punch your ears.

01:06:05.462 --> 01:06:08.882
It's a certainly an attempt at pituitary
growth hormone. We know that much.

01:06:09.215 --> 01:06:13.428
But is there any way we can
neutralize it, in the sea, preferably.

01:06:13.761 --> 01:06:16.055
We can't tell that until we can
get hold of some of the stuff.

01:06:16.097 --> 01:06:16.639
Hold?

01:06:16.681 --> 01:06:18.475
We have their original
formula, but they could

01:06:18.475 --> 01:06:20.435
never work out what it was
that always went wrong.

01:06:20.477 --> 01:06:22.687
So can they give us some
of the stuff itself?

01:06:23.271 --> 01:06:24.272
No.

01:06:24.314 --> 01:06:25.940
They just dropped it like a hot brick.

01:06:26.107 --> 01:06:27.484
They've got none of it left.

01:06:28.485 --> 01:06:30.904
The only hope is at this disposal firm...

01:06:31.154 --> 01:06:32.280
Kestin...

01:06:32.405 --> 01:06:33.781
will have some.

01:06:34.532 --> 01:06:38.077
If they have, stop them
dumping it, and commandeer some for us.

01:06:38.870 --> 01:06:41.831
They're on the mainland,
just opposite Balfe.

01:06:42.081 --> 01:06:43.249
At Wimbra.

01:06:43.291 --> 01:06:46.294
Oh, by God, they didn't put themselves
out with this dumping, did they, eh?

01:06:46.294 --> 01:06:47.295
Exactly.

01:06:47.504 --> 01:06:49.631
Okay, okay I'll get down there.
If they've got any

01:06:49.631 --> 01:06:51.758
of the hormone left I get
it down to you, alright?

01:06:51.799 --> 01:06:53.092
- Call me.
- Alright, bye.

01:06:54.260 --> 01:06:55.845
Morning, Vicar.

01:06:55.970 --> 01:06:57.472
Hi Dr. Shaw.

01:06:57.597 --> 01:06:58.348
I need your help.

01:06:58.348 --> 01:07:00.642
<i>Yes, Vicar, I needed yours yesterday.
What is it?</i>

01:07:00.683 --> 01:07:02.060
I know. I'm sorry.

01:07:02.352 --> 01:07:03.520
You don't understand.

01:07:03.686 --> 01:07:04.812
Please come.

01:07:04.896 --> 01:07:06.147
It's my daughter.

01:07:06.731 --> 01:07:07.857
Please.

01:07:09.150 --> 01:07:10.151
Alright.

01:07:33.091 --> 01:07:34.425
How is she?

01:07:34.676 --> 01:07:36.010
She'll be alright.

01:07:36.886 --> 01:07:38.096
And the baby?

01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:40.014
The baby's dead.

01:07:46.271 --> 01:07:47.647
Where's the father?

01:07:51.109 --> 01:07:52.277
He's not well, he...

01:07:53.444 --> 01:07:54.904
He can't be seen.

01:07:55.405 --> 01:07:57.031
Then you'd better come in, then.

01:08:12.046 --> 01:08:15.174
I gave her a sedative.
She'll sleep for six or seven hours.

01:08:18.595 --> 01:08:19.970
Come over here.

01:08:32.274 --> 01:08:33.943
Yes, yes.

01:09:07.727 --> 01:09:10.145
Hey, did you get around to
everybody about the meeting tonight?

01:09:10.188 --> 01:09:12.273
Yes, I've asked them,
but I don't think they'll come.

01:09:13.441 --> 01:09:14.901
Didn't you explain to them?

01:09:14.984 --> 01:09:15.652
No.

01:09:15.777 --> 01:09:17.194
I thought I gave that to you.

01:09:17.737 --> 01:09:20.782
What are they all afraid of, for god sakes.

01:09:21.491 --> 01:09:24.285
Well, some of them feel it's
a result of inbreeding.

01:09:24.786 --> 01:09:25.953
And the rest...

01:09:26.621 --> 01:09:28.581
They feel it's some kind of judgment.

01:09:28.790 --> 01:09:30.291
Give me that old time religion.

01:09:30.416 --> 01:09:32.502
Well, whatever it is,
they're ashamed of it.

01:09:32.585 --> 01:09:34.087
Yes, that's right enough.

01:09:35.837 --> 01:09:37.506
This disease they've got...

01:09:38.091 --> 01:09:39.425
Can you cure them?

01:09:40.385 --> 01:09:41.386
Can you?

01:09:47.015 --> 01:09:48.559
To be honest with you...

01:09:48.850 --> 01:09:50.310
I don't know.

01:09:51.270 --> 01:09:53.398
I don't know because it
may be different from the

01:09:53.398 --> 01:09:55.316
ordinary acromegaly that
we find in clinics.

01:09:55.358 --> 01:09:57.527
I'm sure we can arrest it. I'm sure of it.

01:09:57.610 --> 01:09:58.736
But what about the others?

01:09:58.820 --> 01:10:00.822
Can't you reverse the
effect it's already had?

01:10:00.905 --> 01:10:02.573
Well, I don't know. How bad are they?

01:10:02.615 --> 01:10:04.158
<i>You've seen as much as I have.</i>

01:10:04.283 --> 01:10:06.786
You mean they"re just to their
beds and haven't been seen since?

01:10:06.828 --> 01:10:09.914
Well, they kept to their houses or
their families kept them there.

01:10:10.039 --> 01:10:12.166
<i>For all I know they may be dead.</i>

01:10:13.584 --> 01:10:15.128
Two of them are anyway.

01:10:16.254 --> 01:10:17.046
Two?

01:10:17.171 --> 01:10:19.966
Old Mr. Murray and the
disappearing body in the woods.

01:10:28.558 --> 01:10:29.976
Yes, that's fine. Thank you.

01:10:30.017 --> 01:10:31.018
Quite, sir.

01:10:34.397 --> 01:10:37.191
- Ah, Dr. Quist, good morning.
- Morning, Admiral.

01:10:37.650 --> 01:10:40.611
Left your young Prentice
at home today, I see.

01:10:40.903 --> 01:10:43.573
Oh, I'm allowed out on my
own from time to time.

01:10:44.657 --> 01:10:45.908
Eh, sit down.

01:10:47.285 --> 01:10:49.245
<i>An, then, what can I do for you?</i>

01:10:50.163 --> 01:10:51.497
Quite a lot, I hope.

01:10:51.748 --> 01:10:54.667
We found out who's been trespassing
on your dump at Castle Rock.

01:10:54.792 --> 01:10:56.127
Oh, good, who?

01:10:56.294 --> 01:10:58.671
Some tin pop disposal firm.

01:10:58.838 --> 01:11:02.008
Kestin Disposals, they call
themselves, from near Wimbra.

01:11:02.216 --> 01:11:03.217
And.

01:11:03.634 --> 01:11:06.929
We now have to get the stuff
they dumped, uh, up again.

01:11:07.680 --> 01:11:08.431
We?

01:11:08.556 --> 01:11:11.434
I don't know of anyone else
with appropriate ships and equipment.

01:11:11.517 --> 01:11:16.022
Yes, but I'm not at all convinced that
the Navy should clean up a civilian's mess.

01:11:16.397 --> 01:11:18.983
Well, surely in essence, that's
what the Navy always has to do.

01:11:19.066 --> 01:11:21.611
In matters of defense, of course.

01:11:21.861 --> 01:11:24.572
<i>But I don't think that this is
{he same thing, at all.</i>

01:11:24.739 --> 01:11:25.865
On the contrary.

01:11:25.907 --> 01:11:28.576
Defense of the realm
would cover it all too well.

01:11:29.827 --> 01:11:32.914
- Hey, you got foo many over that side!
- Right!

01:11:33.039 --> 01:11:34.665
Right! Keep them in the bow!

01:11:34.749 --> 01:11:37.418
Bridle, back. C'mon! Bridle back.

01:11:55.686 --> 01:11:57.021
Can you see anything?

01:11:57.146 --> 01:11:58.731
Nothing like the ones we want.

01:11:59.106 --> 01:12:01.108
Let's find out who's in charge here.

01:12:05.154 --> 01:12:05.988
Who are you?

01:12:06.072 --> 01:12:08.032
Who's in charge here?

01:12:08.074 --> 01:12:09.325
Who wants to know?

01:12:09.450 --> 01:12:11.410
Dr. Shaw wants to know!

01:12:11.452 --> 01:12:12.453
Oh.

01:12:14.288 --> 01:12:15.373
I wonder who he is?

01:12:15.456 --> 01:12:17.959
I think he's the public relations officer.

01:12:18.084 --> 01:12:19.585
He's comin'.

01:12:24.006 --> 01:12:25.258
He's expecting ya.

01:12:25.299 --> 01:12:26.300
Well, I hope so.

01:12:32.765 --> 01:12:34.559
Mr. Brewer's up there.

01:12:45.486 --> 01:12:48.030
I got a call from Doran
saying to expect you.

01:12:48.239 --> 01:12:49.824
- How do you do?
- How do you do?

01:12:49.907 --> 01:12:50.992
<i>What can I do for you?</i>

01:12:51.075 --> 01:12:53.953
Yes, I wonder if you've got any
of the, uh, PGH left?

01:12:54.328 --> 01:12:55.329
Any left?

01:12:55.621 --> 01:12:57.206
Ha ha, I gotta a whole boat load.

01:12:57.331 --> 01:12:58.416
C'mon, follow me.

01:13:07.091 --> 01:13:08.342
<i>Can I take one of these?</i>

01:13:08.676 --> 01:13:09.677
Sure.

01:13:09.844 --> 01:13:12.179
<i>Mr. Broom said I was to
offer you every facility.</i>

01:13:12.847 --> 01:13:14.974
I've got another two hundred
in the hold you can

01:13:14.974 --> 01:13:16.893
save me the trouble of
dumping if you like.

01:13:17.143 --> 01:13:18.686
One'll do, thanks.

01:13:18.978 --> 01:13:20.438
And you're not dumping these.

01:13:21.105 --> 01:13:22.106
What do you mean?

01:13:22.857 --> 01:13:24.650
You're in enough trouble, already.

01:13:25.192 --> 01:13:26.193
Trouble?

01:13:26.527 --> 01:13:28.070
I'm in no trouble.

01:13:28.154 --> 01:13:29.530
You bloody well are!

01:13:29.989 --> 01:13:32.658
For dumping this stuff
in a prohibited area.

01:13:32.909 --> 01:13:34.076
You can't prove it.

01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:35.995
I've got photographs of the dump, man.

01:13:36.746 --> 01:13:38.080
Anyway, why not?

01:13:38.497 --> 01:13:39.832
Where's the harm in it?

01:13:40.082 --> 01:13:42.752
If the Navy can use the place for
a dump, why can't I?

01:13:42.877 --> 01:13:44.295
Do you know what's down there?

01:13:45.838 --> 01:13:47.506
They scuttled a ship there, I'd heard.

01:13:47.715 --> 01:13:50.635
You heard wrong. It was radioactive waste.

01:13:50.927 --> 01:13:53.721
So. if you go ahead and dump this lot,
you'll be out of business so quick

01:13:53.763 --> 01:13:55.473
your feet won't touch the ground.

01:13:55.640 --> 01:13:56.474
Now wait a minute!

01:13:56.515 --> 01:14:00.394
There's no ship down there!
It's radioactive waste!

01:14:01.062 --> 01:14:04.023
The radiation has produced
gas in your canisters...

01:14:04.106 --> 01:14:07.360
and now they're bursting
open like shelling peas!

01:14:07.735 --> 01:14:09.779
C'mon, Victoria, get out.

01:15:27.148 --> 01:15:28.941
Old Mr. Murray.

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:38.034
I'm going in for a drink and I'm going to try
and drum up some support for this meeting.

01:15:41.037 --> 01:15:42.705
Good luck.

01:15:43.330 --> 01:15:44.707
Are you coming with me?

01:15:45.958 --> 01:15:49.045
No, I think I'll...get the school
room ready for the meeting.

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:52.173
- I'll see you later.
- Right.

01:16:00.973 --> 01:16:01.974
Hello, Del?

01:16:02.016 --> 01:16:02.725
Hello, any news?

01:16:02.850 --> 01:16:04.310
We're all organized now.

01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:06.812
We can have a medical team
on Balfe right away.

01:16:07.188 --> 01:16:07.897
Look...

01:16:07.938 --> 01:16:10.399
can you hold it, just until tonight?

01:16:10.691 --> 01:16:11.817
<i>I said we're ready.</i>

01:16:12.109 --> 01:16:12.985
I know.

01:16:13.069 --> 01:16:14.070
I know, I know.

01:16:14.153 --> 01:16:16.447
I've called a meeting of the whole village.

01:16:16.697 --> 01:16:17.823
What for?

01:16:20.367 --> 01:16:25.081
Well, I want to explain everything to them,
just give them a chance to take it in.

01:16:26.165 --> 01:16:29.001
It'll make very little difference,
a matter of hours.

01:16:29.210 --> 01:16:31.545
I'll phone you immediately
after the meeting, okay?

01:16:31.796 --> 01:16:32.880
Alright, then.

01:16:33.172 --> 01:16:34.340
But, that's the latest.

01:16:34.965 --> 01:16:36.383
I'll wait for your call.

01:16:37.968 --> 01:16:38.719
Good luck.

01:16:38.886 --> 01:16:39.887
Thanks.

01:17:10.709 --> 01:17:12.294
Don't come no closer.

01:17:14.463 --> 01:17:15.464
Why not?

01:17:16.382 --> 01:17:17.383
I'm...

01:17:19.051 --> 01:17:20.302
I'm going ugly.

01:17:22.429 --> 01:17:23.556
What do you want?

01:17:25.141 --> 01:17:26.475
I don't know why.

01:17:27.434 --> 01:17:28.769
I wanna talk to you.

01:17:29.478 --> 01:17:31.689
I'm the one who's been
following you since you come.

01:17:33.190 --> 01:17:34.692
Because you want to talk to me?

01:17:34.817 --> 01:17:36.026
No, I was told to.

01:17:36.569 --> 01:17:37.903
To see what you were doing.

01:17:39.280 --> 01:17:40.406
Well...

01:17:40.656 --> 01:17:42.158
What do ya want to talk to me about?

01:17:42.992 --> 01:17:44.285
I don't know.

01:17:45.369 --> 01:17:47.746
<i>I just don't wanna go like me grandfather.</i>

01:17:49.248 --> 01:17:51.333
What, uh, happened to him then?

01:17:55.421 --> 01:17:56.755
He went ugly, too.

01:17:56.964 --> 01:17:58.048
Worse than me.

01:17:58.591 --> 01:18:00.176
But he went bad in the head, too.

01:18:00.259 --> 01:18:01.552
And I don't want that.

01:18:03.137 --> 01:18:06.265
<i>I shouldn't really tell you this,
but it don't matter now, because he's dead.</i>

01:18:06.891 --> 01:18:09.143
He killed my little sister, he went so bad.

01:18:09.685 --> 01:18:11.729
He had terrible rages like a mad animal.

01:18:12.688 --> 01:18:14.648
That's why we had to
hide him out in the barn.

01:18:15.733 --> 01:18:17.109
Oh, that was him, was it?

01:18:17.318 --> 01:18:18.694
Aye, til you found him.

01:18:18.903 --> 01:18:20.237
So we had to bring him back.

01:18:20.571 --> 01:18:21.697
But he died anyway.

01:18:22.448 --> 01:18:23.991
You see, he jumped out the window.

01:18:24.658 --> 01:18:26.619
Your name's Murray, isn't it?

01:18:28.370 --> 01:18:29.496
That's right.

01:18:29.830 --> 01:18:30.956
Brian Murray.

01:18:32.041 --> 01:18:33.667
That was his name, too.

01:18:34.168 --> 01:18:36.003
He handed me his name and...

01:18:36.128 --> 01:18:37.338
this.

01:18:38.505 --> 01:18:40.341
Will you trust me, Brian?

01:18:41.425 --> 01:18:42.843
I don't know.

01:18:43.761 --> 01:18:45.346
I must do, mustn't 1?

01:18:45.512 --> 01:18:47.014
Or want to, at least.

01:18:47.348 --> 01:18:49.808
Will you come to the meeting
at the school house with me?

01:18:51.477 --> 01:18:52.728
What for?

01:18:53.354 --> 01:18:56.523
Well, I want to talk to the people
about what's wrong with them.

01:18:57.358 --> 01:18:59.568
If I had you with me it might help me.

01:19:00.277 --> 01:19:01.946
<i>And them too, I know.</i>

01:19:08.661 --> 01:19:09.662
Okay.

01:20:10.556 --> 01:20:12.474
I'm sorry there aren't more of you.

01:20:16.061 --> 01:20:18.147
Now you all know Brian Murray.

01:20:18.480 --> 01:20:20.274
You don't really know me.

01:20:20.899 --> 01:20:23.986
My name is Dell Shaw and I'm a doctor.

01:20:24.778 --> 01:20:26.363
And when you look at Brian...

01:20:26.655 --> 01:20:31.410
You all, I'm sure, see certain characteristics
that have become familiar to you.

01:20:31.827 --> 01:20:35.497
The overhanging brown,
the broadening of the nose and lips.

01:20:36.123 --> 01:20:38.208
I haven't looked at Brian's teeth...

01:20:38.500 --> 01:20:41.378
but I'd be willing to bet that the
lower teeth are separating...

01:20:41.378 --> 01:20:44.131
because of the abnormal
growth of the jawbone.

01:20:45.132 --> 01:20:46.425
Can I look, Brian?

01:20:48.260 --> 01:20:49.636
Yes, you see.

01:20:50.471 --> 01:20:52.222
And will you notice the hands.

01:20:52.473 --> 01:20:54.683
The thick, spectra fingers.

01:20:56.226 --> 01:20:58.395
<i>Now, I want to make this quite clear...</i>

01:20:58.979 --> 01:21:01.982
this is not due to inbreeding.

01:21:02.149 --> 01:21:06.028
This is not an inherited condition
passed on through families.

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:09.990
This not even, as I've heard it
suggested a “divine judgment.”

01:21:12.326 --> 01:21:16.622
This disease has been well known
to doctors for a long time.

01:21:17.081 --> 01:21:19.625
It is called acromegaly.

01:21:21.043 --> 01:21:24.421
And it is usually caused by
too much of a certain hormone...

01:21:24.671 --> 01:21:28.425
being produced by a gland
at the base of the brain called...

01:21:28.675 --> 01:21:30.803
the pituitary gland.

01:21:33.305 --> 01:21:35.391
In this case, however...

01:21:35.682 --> 01:21:39.436
it is being caused by the hormone
getting in from the outside and it's...

01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:42.606
now probably, we think probably,
in the fish that you eat.

01:21:43.816 --> 01:21:47.444
<i>Now, I know that you've been ashamed of this
disease because you didn't know what it was.</i>

01:21:48.278 --> 01:21:53.283
You can feel it, and you also can feel crimes
committed by the victims of the disease.

01:21:54.243 --> 01:21:57.996
Now, the violence behind them was
triggered off by the same material.

01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:01.458
And now is the time to
come out in the open!

01:22:01.875 --> 01:22:06.547
There is nothing whatever shameful
in this disease and it can be cured!

01:22:07.714 --> 01:22:10.467
I'm going to telephone
the mainland for medical help.

01:22:10.884 --> 01:22:12.511
<i>And I want you...</i>

01:22:12.719 --> 01:22:16.348
to persuade all the people you
think are suffering from this disease...

01:22:16.515 --> 01:22:19.768
to come forward for
examination and treatment.

01:22:20.269 --> 01:22:21.979
You say it can be cured.

01:22:22.187 --> 01:22:23.188
Yes!

01:22:23.230 --> 01:22:23.897
How?

01:22:24.064 --> 01:22:27.317
Well, one way is to treat the
pituitary gland with x-rays..

01:22:27.693 --> 01:22:29.111
Will they do that here?

01:22:29.611 --> 01:22:31.405
On the island, you mean?

01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:34.700
No, it'll probably have to
be done on the mainland.

01:22:40.789 --> 01:22:41.790
Please!

01:22:42.332 --> 01:22:43.834
Please, just listen a moment.

01:22:46.712 --> 01:22:48.088
It's the only way...

01:22:48.255 --> 01:22:49.715
I promise you.

01:22:50.048 --> 01:22:52.801
This is the only way.
There isn't any other.

01:22:53.760 --> 01:22:55.512
And how long's it going to take?

01:22:55.929 --> 01:22:57.347
Well, I don't know.

01:22:57.639 --> 01:22:58.640
Well...

01:22:58.682 --> 01:22:59.516
A week?

01:22:59.683 --> 01:23:00.684
No...

01:23:00.767 --> 01:23:01.435
A month?

01:23:01.685 --> 01:23:03.103
No, it's a long job.

01:23:03.437 --> 01:23:04.980
That's all very well.

01:23:05.230 --> 01:23:06.773
But, how how long then?

01:23:07.149 --> 01:23:08.317
A year?

01:23:08.484 --> 01:23:09.776
Yes, it could be.

01:23:13.363 --> 01:23:16.366
It depends how far the
disease has developed.

01:23:17.034 --> 01:23:20.579
Do you realize how many of us,
uh, have got this disease?

01:23:20.621 --> 01:23:23.248
- No, [ don't know.
- More than half the island.

01:23:23.332 --> 01:23:24.833
More like three quarters.

01:23:24.875 --> 01:23:26.293
There won't be any village left.

01:23:28.045 --> 01:23:29.713
If you don't do something here...

01:23:30.797 --> 01:23:32.591
Listen, please!

01:23:32.883 --> 01:23:34.468
No, you listen!

01:23:34.635 --> 01:23:36.261
You wanna kill the island!

01:23:36.345 --> 01:23:39.306
Its all untraceable! If
you don't do something...

01:23:39.348 --> 01:23:41.016
If, if they don't get treatment...

01:23:41.099 --> 01:23:44.061
You're an outsider and you're
tryin' tell us what to do?

01:23:44.102 --> 01:23:47.898
You'll kill the whole island,
that's what you'll do!

01:23:49.316 --> 01:23:51.026
Listen, please!

01:23:51.068 --> 01:23:52.528
- Listen!
- Del.

01:23:52.903 --> 01:23:53.904
Del...

01:23:54.071 --> 01:23:55.572
It's no good.

01:23:57.324 --> 01:23:59.409
Please! Listen to me!

01:23:59.451 --> 01:24:00.452
Del.

01:24:01.411 --> 01:24:02.704
It's no good.

01:24:03.830 --> 01:24:05.165
Alright, c'mon.

01:24:15.551 --> 01:24:17.094
You've got to listen to us.

01:24:17.135 --> 01:24:19.388
You won't listen and you won't
answer for my...-I'm sorry...

01:24:19.429 --> 01:24:21.598
- I'm sorry.
- I want answers from you!

01:24:21.598 --> 01:24:22.599
I'm sorry.

01:24:31.608 --> 01:24:32.609
Hopeless.

01:24:33.110 --> 01:24:34.194
Hopeless.

01:24:35.195 --> 01:24:37.072
<i>I better phone Quist now.</i>

01:25:01.430 --> 01:25:02.723
What do you want?

01:25:02.764 --> 01:25:04.391
Could we use the phone, Mrs. Straker?

01:25:04.725 --> 01:25:06.059
- It's very late.
- Please.

01:25:08.687 --> 01:25:10.897
Mrs. Straker, it's very urgent.

01:25:25.662 --> 01:25:27.289
I'll turn up the lamp.

01:25:28.373 --> 01:25:29.374
Thank you.

01:25:38.759 --> 01:25:39.760
Operator.

01:25:39.801 --> 01:25:42.429
Hello, I want to make a
call to London, please.

01:25:42.596 --> 01:25:45.891
Yes, it's a personal call to Dr. Quist.

01:25:46.933 --> 01:25:49.061
Q-u-i...

01:25:49.311 --> 01:25:51.021
s-t.

01:26:47.452 --> 01:26:50.288
Oh, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon!

01:26:50.414 --> 01:26:52.082
I'm trying to connect you, sir.

01:26:52.374 --> 01:26:53.625
Del.

01:26:54.167 --> 01:26:55.001
What?

01:26:55.043 --> 01:26:56.336
The back door.

01:27:07.305 --> 01:27:09.266
Get out the front way. Quick.

01:27:20.318 --> 01:27:21.862
Are you there, caller?

01:27:24.489 --> 01:27:25.782
What's he doing?

01:27:25.866 --> 01:27:27.200
He's go the telephone!

01:27:27.534 --> 01:27:29.077
Put it down.

01:27:30.036 --> 01:27:31.997
Put it down!

01:27:32.706 --> 01:27:35.459
Hold the line, please.
I'm trying to connect you.

01:27:37.210 --> 01:27:41.423
You are not going to
destroy this island, Dr. Shaw.

01:27:41.965 --> 01:27:43.508
Our families...

01:27:43.842 --> 01:27:46.678
have lived here for hundreds of year.

01:27:47.596 --> 01:27:49.848
Perhaps that's not a good thing.

01:27:50.223 --> 01:27:52.184
It is our life.

01:27:52.976 --> 01:27:54.603
Without this island...

01:27:54.853 --> 01:27:56.938
we would have no life.

01:27:57.314 --> 01:27:59.816
We'd all be scattered.

01:28:01.193 --> 01:28:03.278
We don't want to harm you...

01:28:03.737 --> 01:28:05.280
but we will...

01:28:05.530 --> 01:28:08.158
if we have to defend our island.

01:28:14.039 --> 01:28:15.373
I'm sorry, but...

01:28:16.416 --> 01:28:20.545
I'm very sorry, but your
community is already damaged.

01:28:21.087 --> 01:28:23.048
It's perhaps beyond repair.

01:28:24.049 --> 01:28:27.344
I don't want to destroy it,
I want to try and save it.

01:28:27.552 --> 01:28:31.014
You, yourselves, are damaged, too,
and I want to try and help you.

01:28:32.140 --> 01:28:34.643
There's no reasonable alternative.

01:28:34.976 --> 01:28:37.813
If you're not treated you'll get worse.

01:28:38.563 --> 01:28:42.943
You'll all go blind, you'll
all die before your time.

01:28:43.318 --> 01:28:46.446
Your island community will certainly die.

01:28:48.782 --> 01:28:50.992
<i>Medical help, I can bring...</i>

01:28:51.034 --> 01:28:52.828
is your only hope.

01:28:53.036 --> 01:28:55.914
I'm going to telephone the mainland,
now, to get help.

01:28:59.835 --> 01:29:03.296
We'll kill if we have to.
Make no mistake about that!

01:29:10.136 --> 01:29:11.137
Operator.

01:29:11.304 --> 01:29:12.639
Hello? -Hello?

01:29:13.181 --> 01:29:14.641
That number's ... -Hello!

01:29:15.350 --> 01:29:18.019
I want to make a call to London, please.

01:29:18.103 --> 01:29:20.856
London. Just hold the line a moment, sir.

01:29:27.988 --> 01:29:29.823
Caller, can you hear me?

01:29:30.615 --> 01:29:31.658
Hello?

01:29:34.286 --> 01:29:35.328
Hello, caller?

01:29:36.413 --> 01:29:37.622
Number, please.

01:29:38.957 --> 01:29:39.958
Hello?

01:29:42.419 --> 01:29:43.503
Hello.

01:29:44.004 --> 01:29:46.798
Get me Doomwatch in London, please.

01:29:51.928 --> 01:29:54.097
Women and children down
to the life boats, please.

01:29:55.932 --> 01:29:57.475
Let the stretcher through.

01:29:59.561 --> 01:30:03.189
Anybody in need of immediate medical
attention go to the Red Cross tent.

01:30:03.732 --> 01:30:06.359
Don't panic. Don't panic.

01:30:10.322 --> 01:30:12.449
Here, children, c'mon.

01:30:12.866 --> 01:30:15.201
So, you heard the marlin,
take the luggage for them.

01:30:15.243 --> 01:30:16.369
Make sure they're safe.

01:30:16.369 --> 01:30:18.747
I'll see you tonight on
the mainland. I promise.

01:30:28.965 --> 01:30:30.550
Are they all going?

01:30:30.592 --> 01:30:31.593
Yes.

01:30:32.677 --> 01:30:34.763
Every family has at least one affected.

01:30:35.472 --> 01:30:37.223
Some of them have got two.

01:30:39.809 --> 01:30:42.520
This island will be
in ruins in two years.
