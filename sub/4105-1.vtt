From the Treaty of the Treason:

00:37.600 --> 00:40.684
In penance for their uprising,each district shall offer up

00:41.000 --> 00:46.000
a male and female between the ages of 12 and 18 at a public 'reaping'.

00:48.360 --> 00:51.260
These Tributes shall be delivered to the custody of the Capitol.

00:51.550 --> 00:55.893
And then transferred to a public arena where they will Fight to the Death, until a lone victor remains.

00:58.144 --> 01:01.600
Henceforth and forevermore this pageant shall be known as The Hunger Games.

01:01.604 --> 01:02.646
<i>I think it's our tradition.</i>

01:02.730 --> 01:06.108
It comes out of a particularly painful
part of our history.

01:06.192 --> 01:07.276
Yes, yes.

01:07.359 --> 01:10.362
But it's been the way
we've been able to heal.

01:10.446 --> 01:12.615
At first, it was a reminder of the rebellion.

01:12.948 --> 01:15.534
- It was a price the districts had to pay.
- Yes.

01:15.618 --> 01:17.870
But I think it has grown from that.

01:17.953 --> 01:21.373
I think it's something
that knits us all together.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.461
This is your third year as Gamemaker.

01:27.463 --> 01:30.591

You were dreaming.

01:43.312 --> 01:44.647
It was me.

01:45.815 --> 01:48.859
I know. I know. But it's not.

01:49.819 --> 01:52.154
It's your first year, Prim.
Your name's only been in there once.

01:52.238 --> 01:54.323
They're not gonna pick you.

01:54.824 --> 01:56.575
Try to go to sleep.

01:56.659 --> 01:57.868
I can't.

01:58.494 --> 02:01.372
Just try. Just try.

02:34.363 --> 02:36.157
You finish it. I've got to go.

02:36.240 --> 02:37.283
Where?

02:38.033 --> 02:39.326
I've just got to go.

02:39.827 --> 02:42.454
<i>But I'll be back. I love you</i>

What are you gonna do with that
when you kill it?

05:07.683 --> 05:10.519
Damn you, Gale! It's not funny!

05:10.602 --> 05:13.647
What are you gonna do
with a 100-pound deer, Catnip?

05:13.731 --> 05:16.275
It's Reaping Day.
The place is crawling with Peacekeepers.

05:16.358 --> 05:19.486
I was gonna sell it to some Peacekeepers.

05:19.570 --> 05:20.779
Of course you were.

05:20.863 --> 05:22.114
Like you don't sell to Peacekeepers.

05:22.197 --> 05:23.532
No. Not today.

05:23.615 --> 05:26.618
It was the first deer I've seen in a year.
Now I have nothing.

05:26.702 --> 05:27.828
Okay.

06:18.587 --> 06:21.173
What if they did? Just one year.
What if everyone just stopped watching?

06:21.256 --> 06:23.384
- They won't, Gale.
- What if they did? What if we did?

06:23.467 --> 06:25.010
Won't happen.

06:25.094 --> 06:27.179
You root for your favorites.
You cry when they get killed.

06:27.262 --> 06:28.514
- It's sick.
- Gale.

06:28.597 --> 06:30.974
If no one watches,
then they don't have a game.

06:31.058 --> 06:32.518
It's as simple as that.

06:32.601 --> 06:34.186
- What?
- Nothing.

06:35.396 --> 06:38.315
- Fine. Laugh at me.
- I'm not laughing at you.

06:44.196 --> 06:46.198
We could do it, you know?

06:48.283 --> 06:50.411
Take off, live in the woods.
It's what we do anyway.

06:50.494 --> 06:51.537
They'd catch us.

06:51.620 --> 06:53.247
Well, maybe not.

06:53.789 --> 06:57.376
Cut out our tongues, or worse.
We wouldn't make it five miles.

06:57.459 --> 07:00.295
No, I'd get five miles. I'd go that way.

07:01.213 --> 07:03.048
I have Prim, and you have your brothers.

07:03.132 --> 07:04.133
They can come, too.

07:04.216 --> 07:05.926
Prim in the woods?

07:07.761 --> 07:09.263
Or maybe not.

07:10.514 --> 07:12.474
I'm never having kids.

07:13.642 --> 07:15.727
I might, if I didn't live here.

07:15.811 --> 07:17.980
- But you do live here.
- I know, but if I didn't.

07:21.483 --> 07:22.901
I forgot.

07:23.569 --> 07:24.570
Here.

Oh, my God! Is this real?

Guess the odds aren't exactly in my favor.

08:15.162 --> 08:16.747
Thank you, girl.

08:24.963 --> 08:26.131
What's this?

08:26.632 --> 08:28.717
That's a Mockingjay.

08:31.011 --> 08:32.261
How much?

08:34.306 --> 08:37.308
- You keep it. It's yours.
- Thank you.

Okay.

09:30.153 --> 09:31.905
Now you look beautiful, too.

09:31.989 --> 09:33.699
Wish I looked like you.

09:34.116 --> 09:37.953
No. l wish I looked like you, little duck.

09:43.917 --> 09:46.545
Hey. You want to see what I got you today?

09:49.589 --> 09:52.551
It's a Mockingjay pin. To protect you.

09:54.052 --> 09:58.015
And as long as you have it,
nothing bad will happen to you.

09:58.265 --> 10:00.267
Okay? I promise.

10:58.075 --> 10:59.951
Prim, it's okay. It's okay.

11:00.035 --> 11:01.787
Okay. It's time to sign in now. Okay?

11:01.870 --> 11:03.997
They're gonna prick your finger
just to take a little bit of blood.

11:04.081 --> 11:05.207
- You didn't say...
- I know.

11:05.290 --> 11:06.875
It doesn't hurt much. Just a little.

11:07.501 --> 11:10.879
Okay? Go sit down there with the little kids.
I'll find you after. Okay?

we have a very special film.</i>

12:37.883 --> 12:41.553
<i>Brought to you all the way from The Capitol.</i>

12:44.931 --> 12:47.392
War. Terrible war.

12:48.977 --> 12:49.978
<i>War.</i>

12:50.770 --> 12:55.734
<i>Terrible war.

<i>This was the uprising that rocked our land.</i>

<i>Thirteen districts rebelled against
the country that fed them,</i>

13:03.575 --> 13:05.410
<i>loved them, protected them.</i>

13:06.161 --> 13:09.372
<i>Brother turned on brother
until nothing remained.</i>

<i>And then came the peace,
hard fought, sorely won.</i>

<i>A people rose up from the ashes,
and a new era was born.</i>

13:20.008 --> 13:23.678
<i>But freedom has a cost.
And the traitors were defeated.</i>

13:23.762 --> 13:28.350
<i>We swore as a nation
we would never know this treason again.</i>

13:28.433 --> 13:33.647
<i>And so it was decreed that each year
the various districts of Panem</i>

13:33.730 --> 13:37.359
<i>would offer up, in tribute,
one young man and woman</i>

13:37.442 --> 13:42.614
<i>to fight to the death in a pageant of honor,
courage, and sacrifice.</i>

13:42.697 --> 13:46.993
<i>The lone victor, bathed in riches,
would serve as a reminder</i>

13:47.077 --> 13:50.121
<i>of our generosity and our forgiveness.</i>

13:50.205 --> 13:52.874
<i>This is how we remember our past.</i>

13:53.375 --> 13:57.003
<i>This is how we safeguard our future.</i>

13:57.087 --> 13:58.672
<i>I just love that!</i>

14:01.299 --> 14:05.136
<i>Now, the time has come for us to select</i>

- No!

18:12.342 --> 18:13.593
It's okay.

18:13.885 --> 18:18.264
Prim. Prim. It's okay.
Prim, I don't have much time.

18:18.348 --> 18:22.894
Prim. Listen. You're gonna be okay.
Don't take any extra food from them.

18:22.977 --> 18:25.188
It isn't worth putting your name in
more times. Okay?

18:25.271 --> 18:29.234
Listen, Prim. Gale will bring you game.
You can sell cheese from your goat.

18:30.276 --> 18:31.903
Just try to win. Maybe you can.

18:32.654 --> 18:33.988
Of course.

18:34.656 --> 18:36.991
And maybe I can. I am smart, you know?

18:37.075 --> 18:39.828
- And you can hunt.
- Exactly.

18:46.292 --> 18:47.836
To protect you.

18:53.299 --> 18:54.676
Thank you.

19:07.939 --> 19:09.899
You can't tune out again.

19:10.525 --> 19:13.862
- I won't.
- No, you can't. Not like when Dad died.

19:13.945 --> 19:15.613
I won't be there anymore. You're all she has.

19:15.697 --> 19:18.741
No matter what you feel, you have to
be there for her. Do you understand?

19:20.410 --> 19:21.786
Don't cry.

19:24.747 --> 19:27.458
Don't cry. Don't. Don't.

19:29.961 --> 19:31.671
- It's time.
- Prim, it's okay.

19:31.754 --> 19:35.633
- Prim, it's okay. It's okay, Prim.
- No!No!No!

19:35.717 --> 19:37.677
I promise, Prim.

19:54.569 --> 19:56.613
- I'm fine.
- Yeah, I know.

19:56.738 --> 19:57.906
I am.

19:58.865 --> 20:02.827
Listen to me. You're stronger than they are.
You are.

20:02.911 --> 20:04.162
- Get to a bow.
- They may not have...

20:04.245 --> 20:06.497
They will if you show them
how good you are.

20:06.581 --> 20:08.708
They just want a good show.
That's all they want.

20:08.791 --> 20:10.627
If they don't have a bow,
then you make one, okay?

20:10.710 --> 20:12.211
You know how to hunt.

20:12.295 --> 20:13.546
Animals.

20:15.298 --> 20:16.341
It's no different, Katniss.

20:18.593 --> 20:21.512
There's 24 of us, Gale. Only one comes out.

20:21.596 --> 20:23.765
Yeah. And it's gonna be you.

20:24.307 --> 20:25.391
Okay.

20:25.475 --> 20:27.644
Take care of them, Gale.
Whatever you do, don't let them starve.

20:27.727 --> 20:29.771
- Let's go.
- I'll see you soon, okay?

20:33.107 --> 20:34.692
You two are in for a treat.

20:34.776 --> 20:38.446
Crystal chandeliers, platinum doorknobs,
and it flies.

20:38.529 --> 20:40.698
We'll be at The Capitol
in less than two days.

20:40.782 --> 20:43.284
Now, before you do anything else...

21:39.465 --> 21:42.260
<i>200 miles per hour,
and you can barely feel a thing.</i>

21:42.343 --> 21:45.096
I think it's one of the wonderful things about
this opportunity,

21:45.179 --> 21:48.725
that even though you're here
and even though it's just for a little while,

21:48.808 --> 21:51.352
you get to enjoy all of this.

21:55.023 --> 21:59.444
I'm going to find Haymitch.
He's probably in the bar car.

22:11.706 --> 22:13.374
Have you ever met him?

22:16.169 --> 22:17.420
Haymitch?

22:21.883 --> 22:25.887
You know, Katniss, he is our mentor.
He did win this thing once.

22:32.685 --> 22:35.146
Look, you know,
if you don't want to talk, I understand,

22:35.229 --> 22:38.441
but I just don't think there's anything wrong
with getting a little bit of help.

23:03.299 --> 23:04.926
Congratulations.

23:23.861 --> 23:25.488
Where's the ice?

23:27.365 --> 23:28.449
I don't know.

23:34.622 --> 23:35.957
May I?

23:40.878 --> 23:44.549
Okay, so... So when do we start?

23:45.758 --> 23:47.343
So eager.

23:48.052 --> 23:50.638
Most of you aren't in such a hurry.

23:50.972 --> 23:53.224
Yeah. I wanna know what the plan is.
You're our mentor.

23:53.307 --> 23:54.642
- You're supposed to go...
- Mentor?

23:55.810 --> 23:57.019
Yeah, our mentor.

23:57.103 --> 23:59.772
You're supposed to tell us
how to get sponsors and give us advice.

24:00.481 --> 24:01.732
Okay.

24:03.359 --> 24:07.155
Embrace the probability
of your imminent death.

24:08.489 --> 24:14.370
And know, in your heart,
that there's nothing I can do to save you.

24:15.580 --> 24:17.373
So why are you here then?

24:18.416 --> 24:19.625
The refreshments.

24:19.834 --> 24:21.169
Okay, I think that's enough of that.

24:25.798 --> 24:29.594
You made me spill my drink.
These are brand new pants.

24:30.845 --> 24:34.682
You know, I think I'll go
finish this in my room.

24:50.865 --> 24:52.575
He's gonna come around.

24:52.658 --> 24:53.784
It's no use.

24:53.868 --> 24:55.786
I'm gonna go talk to him.

25:02.793 --> 25:05.838
<i>We have two very fit 16-year-olds.</i>

25:05.922 --> 25:09.258
<i>Of course, of course.
They always provide pretty good opponents.</i>

25:09.342 --> 25:10.676
<i>Yes, yes, they do.</i>

25:10.760 --> 25:12.637
<i>- Do you remember this year?
- Of course.</i>

25:12.720 --> 25:16.307
<i>One of my favorite years.
And one of my favorite Arenas.</i>

25:16.390 --> 25:19.310
<i>The use of the rubble in the ruined city...</i>

25:19.560 --> 25:20.645
<i>Very exciting.</i>

25:20.728 --> 25:22.313
<i>And this moment here,</i>

25:22.396 --> 25:24.982
<i>this moment is a moment
that you never forget.</i>

25:25.066 --> 25:26.400
<i>Yes.</i>

25:26.484 --> 25:29.570
<i>The moment when a Tribute
becomes a victor.</i>

26:04.772 --> 26:07.650
- You'd freeze to death first.
- No, because I'd light a fire.

26:07.733 --> 26:09.360
That's a good way to get killed.

26:09.443 --> 26:11.028
What's a good way to get killed?

26:12.613 --> 26:15.074
Joy. Why don't you join us?

26:16.117 --> 26:18.911
I was just giving some life-saving advice.

26:20.371 --> 26:21.497
Like what?

26:21.580 --> 26:23.874
I was just asking about how to find shelter.

26:24.417 --> 26:28.045
Which would come in handy if,
in fact, you were still alive.

26:30.423 --> 26:31.799
How do you find shelter?

26:32.717 --> 26:34.010
Pass the jam.

26:34.093 --> 26:35.678
How do you find shelter?

26:36.012 --> 26:38.556
Give me a chance to wake up , sweetheart.

26:39.974 --> 26:43.894
This mentoring is very taxing stuff.

26:49.775 --> 26:51.402
Can you pass the marmalade?

26:52.987 --> 26:54.739
That is mahogany!

26:55.531 --> 26:58.993
Look at you. Just killed a placemat.

27:00.453 --> 27:02.747
You really want to know how to stay alive?

27:04.123 --> 27:06.000
You get people to like you.

27:09.045 --> 27:11.172
Not what you were expecting?

27:12.006 --> 27:17.470
Well, when you're in the middle of
The Games and you're starving or freezing,

27:17.553 --> 27:20.973
some water, a knife, or even some matches

27:21.057 --> 27:23.559
can mean the difference
between life and death.

27:24.018 --> 27:27.063
And those things only come from sponsors.

27:27.646 --> 27:31.734
And to get sponsors,
you have to make people like you.

27:33.194 --> 27:38.240
And right now, sweetheart,
you're not off to a real good start.

27:39.200 --> 27:40.576
There it is.

27:45.873 --> 27:47.208
It's huge!

27:48.209 --> 27:49.835
That's incredible.

28:14.568 --> 28:16.028
Peeta, I love you.

28:24.578 --> 28:26.831
Come on. Come on.

28:31.752 --> 28:35.297
You better keep this knife.
He knows what he's doing.

28:46.267 --> 28:47.852
<i>So now that you've seen them,</i>

28:47.935 --> 28:50.729
<i>what do you think about
this year's crop of recruits?</i>

28:50.813 --> 28:54.024
Are there any surprises
that we can expect this year?

28:54.108 --> 28:55.651
It's really hard to tell just from a Reaping,

28:55.734 --> 28:59.155
-but I think this is a very interesting mix.
- Yes.

28:59.238 --> 29:01.449
And whenever you have a volunteer
from an outlying district,

29:01.532 --> 29:03.868
<i>that's something you can't ignore.</i>

29:31.312 --> 29:32.480
What's that?

29:33.689 --> 29:34.982
What's that?

29:35.316 --> 29:37.234
We're just saying we might need
to hose you down again

29:37.318 --> 29:39.445
before we take you to Cinna.

29:46.035 --> 29:50.206
That was one of the bravest things
I've ever seen. With your sister?

29:50.748 --> 29:52.500
- My name's Cinna.
- Katniss.

29:52.958 --> 29:55.044
I'm sorry that this happened to you,

29:55.127 --> 29:57.087
and I'm here to help you
in any way that I can.

29:59.590 --> 30:01.634
Most people just congratulate me.

30:01.842 --> 30:04.011
Well, I don't see the point in that.

30:05.387 --> 30:08.057
So tonight, they have the Tribute Parade.

30:08.891 --> 30:12.102
I'm gonna take you out
and show you off to the world.

30:12.186 --> 30:13.938
So you're here to make me look pretty?

30:14.021 --> 30:15.356
I'm here to help you make an impression.

30:16.815 --> 30:19.276
Now, usually they dress people
in the clothes from their district.

30:19.360 --> 30:21.737
- Yeah, we're always coalminers.
- Yeah, but I don't wanna do that.

30:23.030 --> 30:25.241
I wanna do something
that they're gonna remember.

30:25.324 --> 30:27.868
Did they explain
about trying to get sponsors?

30:28.244 --> 30:30.663
Yeah, but I'm not very good
at making friends.

30:30.913 --> 30:32.331
We'll see.

30:33.958 --> 30:36.126
I just think somebody that brave

30:37.419 --> 30:41.382
shouldn't be dressed up
in some stupid costume, now should they?

30:43.842 --> 30:45.219
I hope not.

30:52.393 --> 30:54.478
Okay, this is safe. I promise.

30:54.561 --> 30:57.815
It's not real fire. These suits are built
so you won't feel a thing.

30:57.898 --> 30:59.149
Looks pretty real to me.

30:59.233 --> 31:00.818
Well, that's the idea.

31:00.901 --> 31:01.902
You ready?

31:02.069 --> 31:04.446
- Don't be afraid.
- I'm not afraid.

31:24.842 --> 31:30.264
Over 100,000 people craning
to get a glimpse of this year's Tributes.

31:30.347 --> 31:33.350
<i>And the sponsors get to see the Tributes
for the first time.</i>

31:33.434 --> 31:36.353
The importance of this moment
cannot be overstated.

31:41.317 --> 31:42.651
Very nice.

31:43.110 --> 31:47.948
First chariot on my count, in 15, 14, 13...

31:50.534 --> 31:53.954
There they are. There they are.
This year's Tributes.

31:54.538 --> 31:56.040
<i>It's the most exciting part.</i>

31:56.123 --> 31:58.042
<i>It just gives you goose bumps.</i>

31:58.125 --> 32:00.252
<i>And don't you love how the stylists,</i>

32:00.336 --> 32:04.631
they so clearly are able to
reflect the character of each district?

32:05.090 --> 32:07.718
<i>- Right. Right. There's District 4.
- Yes.</i>

32:08.635 --> 32:09.720
<i>- Fishing.
- I get it.</i>

32:09.803 --> 32:11.972
<i>- I like it.
- That's very good.</i>

32:12.473 --> 32:17.102
And behind them,
we have two power plant workers. Right?

32:17.186 --> 32:18.562
And then...

32:19.480 --> 32:21.899
What is that in the background?

32:48.634 --> 32:49.843
Come on. They'll love it.

32:56.934 --> 32:57.935
Yeah!

32:58.018 --> 32:59.478
<i>Now see that? I love that.</i>

32:59.561 --> 33:02.272
<i>Two young people
holding their hands up, saying,</i>

33:02.356 --> 33:06.151
<i>"I'm proud I come from District 12.
We will not be overlooked."</i>

33:06.235 --> 33:07.403
- Nope.
- I love that!

33:07.486 --> 33:10.197
<i>People are sure gonna be paying attention
to them right now.</i>

33:12.449 --> 33:14.326
And we're ready.

33:14.535 --> 33:15.911
<i>President Snow, you're live.</i>

33:46.233 --> 33:47.651
<i>Welcome.</i>

33:51.405 --> 33:52.823
<i>Welcome.</i>

33:54.074 --> 33:57.286
<i>Tributes, we welcome you.</i>

33:59.079 --> 34:04.334
<i>We salute your courage and your sacrifice.</i>

34:08.589 --> 34:10.090
<i>And we wish you</i>

34:12.176 --> 34:14.094
<i>Happy Hunger Games.</i>

34:14.469 --> 34:18.431
<i>And may the odds be ever in your favor.</i>

34:30.944 --> 34:33.030
That was amazing.

34:33.112 --> 34:35.616
We are all
anybody's going to be talking about.

34:35.991 --> 34:37.367
So brave.

34:37.451 --> 34:39.578
Are you sure you should be
near an open flame?

34:39.661 --> 34:42.998
Fake flame? Are you sure you...

34:52.132 --> 34:54.551
Let's go upstairs.

34:58.305 --> 35:00.432
So, each of the districts get their own floor.

35:00.516 --> 35:03.977
And because you're from 12,
you get the penthouse.

35:11.193 --> 35:12.486
Come on.

35:16.406 --> 35:18.617
So this is the living room.

35:19.409 --> 35:21.495
I know, I know.

35:22.287 --> 35:24.998
Now, your rooms are right over here.

35:25.082 --> 35:28.835
Why don't you go clean yourselves up
a little before dinner?

36:46.246 --> 36:50.208
In two weeks, 23 of you will be dead.

36:50.292 --> 36:52.252
One of you will be alive.

36:52.336 --> 36:56.715
Who that is depends on how well
you pay attention over the next four days,

36:56.798 --> 36:59.384
particularly to what I'm about to say.

36:59.468 --> 37:02.554
First, no fighting with the other Tributes.

37:02.638 --> 37:04.514
You'll have plenty of time for that
in the Arena.

37:05.098 --> 37:09.478
There are four compulsory exercises.
The rest will be individual training.

37:09.561 --> 37:12.564
My advice is don't ignore the survival skills.

37:12.648 --> 37:14.232
Everybody wants to grab a sword,

37:14.316 --> 37:17.027
but most of you will die
from natural causes.

37:17.319 --> 37:20.989
10% from infection, 20% from dehydration.

37:21.114 --> 37:23.950
Exposure can kill as easily as a knife.

37:56.024 --> 37:58.485
- Jason, where's my knife, huh?
- I didn't touch your knife.

37:58.568 --> 38:01.154
- I put my knife right there!
- Don't touch me. I didn't touch your knife!

38:01.238 --> 38:02.781
- Yes, you took my knife!
- I didn't touch your knife!

38:02.864 --> 38:04.449
- You took my knife, you liar!
- I didn't touch your knife.

38:04.533 --> 38:05.534
- You liar!
- I didn't touch your knife!

38:05.617 --> 38:07.744
You little punk! He took my knife!

38:07.828 --> 38:09.579
- Get off me!
- I'm just sitting here.

38:09.663 --> 38:12.249
I'll finish you right now, kid!

38:12.332 --> 38:14.042
Actually, better yet, I'll wait for the Arena.

38:14.126 --> 38:15.627
You're the first one I get,
so watch your back.

38:19.423 --> 38:22.300
- Everybody, back in line!
- You know who you're messing with, kid!

38:22.384 --> 38:24.761
He's a Career. You know what that is?

38:24.845 --> 38:26.847
- From District 1.
- And 2.

38:27.264 --> 38:30.767
They train in a special academy
until they're 18. Then they volunteer.

38:30.851 --> 38:34.062
By that point, they're pretty lethal.

38:34.146 --> 38:36.231
But they don't receive any special treatment.

38:36.314 --> 38:38.817
In fact, they stay in the exact
same apartment as you do.

38:38.900 --> 38:41.903
And I don't think they let them have dessert.
And you can.

38:43.113 --> 38:44.698
So how good are they?

38:45.866 --> 38:49.286
Obviously they're pretty good.
They win it almost every year, but...

38:49.369 --> 38:50.620
Almost.

38:50.871 --> 38:52.873
...they can be arrogant.

38:53.457 --> 38:56.960
And arrogance can be a big problem.

38:59.296 --> 39:01.298
I hear you can shoot.

39:04.050 --> 39:05.302
I'm all right.

39:05.385 --> 39:07.929
No, she's better than all right.
My father buys her squirrels.

39:09.389 --> 39:12.058
He says she hits them
right in the eye every time.

39:13.852 --> 39:15.645
- Peeta's strong.
- What?

39:15.729 --> 39:18.148
He can throw a 100-pound sack
of flour right over his head. I've seen it.

39:18.231 --> 39:20.609
Okay, well, I'm not gonna kill
anybody with a sack of flour.

39:20.692 --> 39:22.319
No, but you might have
a better chance of winning

39:22.402 --> 39:23.653
if somebody comes after you with a knife.

39:23.737 --> 39:26.782
I have no chance of winning!
None! All right?

39:32.537 --> 39:35.081
It's true. Everybody knows it.

39:38.251 --> 39:40.420
You know what my mother said?

39:40.670 --> 39:43.840
She said District 12
might finally have a winner.

39:44.424 --> 39:46.009
But she wasn't talking about me.

39:47.427 --> 39:49.471
She was talking about you.

39:54.935 --> 39:56.686
I'm not very hungry.

40:34.683 --> 40:35.851
I'm done, too.

41:19.060 --> 41:20.520
Throw that metal thing over there.

41:20.854 --> 41:21.980
What?

41:24.691 --> 41:27.193
No. Haymitch said we're not supposed
to show our skills.

41:27.277 --> 41:28.278
I don't care what Haymitch said.

41:28.361 --> 41:30.405
Those guys are looking at you
like you're a meal.

41:30.488 --> 41:31.573
Throw it.

42:16.618 --> 42:17.661
Hi.

42:18.620 --> 42:19.621
Hey.

42:19.996 --> 42:21.456
How did you do that?

42:21.915 --> 42:25.251
I used to decorate the cakes
down at the bakery.

42:26.503 --> 42:27.921
I'll show you.

42:30.215 --> 42:31.257
See?

42:33.051 --> 42:34.052
Yeah.

42:35.971 --> 42:37.931
Hey, I think you have a shadow.

43:03.790 --> 43:07.961
Tomorrow, they'll bring you in one by one
and evaluate you.

43:08.586 --> 43:11.923
This is important, because higher ratings
will mean sponsors.

43:12.173 --> 43:14.718
This is the time to show them everything.

43:14.801 --> 43:17.637
There'll be a bow. Make sure you use it.

43:17.721 --> 43:19.472
Peeta, you make sure to show your strength.

43:20.181 --> 43:24.019
They'll start with District 1,
so the two of you will go last.

43:25.061 --> 43:28.565
I don't know how else to put this.
Make sure they remember you.

43:40.076 --> 43:42.287
<i>Katniss Everdeen.</i>

43:53.965 --> 43:55.425
Hey, Katniss?

43:56.009 --> 43:57.802
Shoot straight.

44:58.154 --> 44:59.781
Katniss Everdeen.

45:01.157 --> 45:02.909
District 12.

46:29.746 --> 46:30.914
Hey, hey, hey-

46:30.997 --> 46:34.500
Hey, who ordered this pig?
Who ordered this pig? Hey!

46:34.584 --> 46:35.877
Did you get some pig yet?

46:53.853 --> 46:56.522
Thank you for your consideration.

47:02.403 --> 47:04.447
- Are you crazy?
- I just got mad.

47:04.530 --> 47:05.657
Mad?

47:06.366 --> 47:11.454
You realize that your actions reflect badly
on all of us. Notjust you.

47:11.537 --> 47:13.081
They just want a good show. It's fine.

47:13.164 --> 47:16.751
How about it's just bad manners, Cinna!
How about that?

47:16.834 --> 47:21.256
Well, finally! I hope you noticed
we have a serious situation.

47:25.093 --> 47:27.136
Nice shooting, sweetheart.

47:28.554 --> 47:32.642
What did they do when you shot the apple?

47:33.559 --> 47:35.061
Well, they looked pretty startled.

47:35.270 --> 47:36.437
Yeah.

47:38.898 --> 47:40.984
Now, what did you say? "Thanks for..."

47:41.067 --> 47:42.652
- Thanks for your consideration.
-"...your consideration."

47:42.735 --> 47:45.071
Genius! Genius.

47:45.154 --> 47:49.826
I don't think we're gonna find this funny
if the Gamemakers decide to take it out...

47:49.909 --> 47:51.369
On who? On her?

47:52.245 --> 47:53.663
On him?

47:53.746 --> 47:56.749
I think they already have.
Loosen your corset, have a drink.

47:57.792 --> 48:00.420
I would have given anything to see it.

48:01.170 --> 48:04.173
<i>As you know, the Tributes were rated
on a scale of 1 to 12</i>

48:04.257 --> 48:07.093
<i>after three days of careful evaluation.</i>

48:07.302 --> 48:10.888
<i>The Gamekeepers would like
to acknowledge that it was an exceptional...</i>

48:11.431 --> 48:16.311
<i>From District 1, Marvel, with a score of nine.</i>

48:16.394 --> 48:19.939
<i>From District 2, Cato, with a score of 10.</i>

48:20.023 --> 48:22.233
<i>Clove, with a score of 10.</i>

48:22.317 --> 48:25.528
<i>From District 3...
From District 4, with a score of...</i>

48:25.611 --> 48:26.988
<i>From District 7...</i>

48:27.071 --> 48:28.740
<i>From District 8...</i>

48:29.449 --> 48:32.118
<i>And Rue with a score of seven.</i>

48:32.201 --> 48:33.911
<i>Now our final district.</i>

48:33.995 --> 48:38.666
<i>From District 12. Peeta Mellark.</i>

48:42.628 --> 48:45.173
<i>A score of eight.</i>

48:46.466 --> 48:47.759
- Excellent.
- Peeta!

48:47.842 --> 48:48.885
Bravo.

48:48.968 --> 48:51.179
- We can work with that.
- Good job.

48:53.931 --> 48:54.974
<i>And finally,</i>

48:57.477 --> 48:58.853
<i>from District 12,</i>

49:01.105 --> 49:03.232
<i>Katniss E verdeen.</i>

49:06.819 --> 49:08.488
<i>With a score of...</i>

49:11.532 --> 49:12.658
<i>Eleven.</i>

49:14.243 --> 49:16.496
- Katniss!
- Outstanding!

49:16.871 --> 49:18.039
- Yes!
- Eleven?

49:18.623 --> 49:20.208
Congratulations.

49:20.458 --> 49:21.626
I thought they hated me.

49:21.709 --> 49:23.044
They must have liked your guts.

49:23.127 --> 49:27.256
To Katniss Everdeen, The Girl on Fire!

49:27.882 --> 49:30.176
Goodness. We are.

49:30.301 --> 49:31.511
An 11?

49:31.969 --> 49:32.970
She earned it.

49:33.054 --> 49:35.098
She shot an arrow at your head.

49:35.181 --> 49:36.474
Well, at an apple.

49:36.557 --> 49:37.809
Near your head.

49:38.476 --> 49:39.852
Sit down.

49:45.149 --> 49:48.194
Seneca, why do you think we have a winner?

49:50.696 --> 49:52.031
What do you mean?

49:52.949 --> 49:56.702
I mean, why do we have a winner?

49:59.288 --> 50:01.207
I mean, if we just wanted to
intimidate the districts,

50:01.290 --> 50:05.878
why not round up 24 of them at random
and execute them all at once?

50:05.962 --> 50:07.713
Be a lot faster.

50:10.049 --> 50:11.134
Hope.

50:12.051 --> 50:13.177
Hope?

50:13.261 --> 50:14.345
Hope.

50:15.054 --> 50:18.307
It is the only thing stronger than fear.

50:19.809 --> 50:23.604
A little hope is effective.
A lot of hope is dangerous.

50:23.688 --> 50:26.983
A spark is fine, as long as it's contained.

50:29.444 --> 50:30.445
So...

50:31.737 --> 50:34.657
So contain it.

50:37.076 --> 50:38.244
Right.

50:38.744 --> 50:41.581
So she's staring at all my jewels.
She cannot take her eyes off of them.

50:41.664 --> 50:44.083
- Well, look at all that that you're wearing.
- Frankly, it was rude.

50:45.251 --> 50:46.794
Haymitch, you should join us.

50:46.878 --> 50:49.338
We're having some of
your favorite for dinner.

50:49.422 --> 50:50.590
Lovely.

50:54.677 --> 50:56.554
- Where's Peeta?
- He's in his room.

50:56.637 --> 51:00.516
Now, listen, tomorrow's the last day.

51:00.600 --> 51:03.227
And they let us work with our own Tributes
right before The Games,

51:03.311 --> 51:06.105
so you and I will be going down at 9:00.

51:07.690 --> 51:09.108
What about him?

51:09.775 --> 51:13.279
He says he wants to be trained
on his own from now on.

51:14.530 --> 51:15.615
What?

51:16.199 --> 51:21.162
This kind of thing does happen at this point.
There's only one winner, right?

51:27.627 --> 51:29.712
We should have some
chocolate-covered strawberries.

51:29.795 --> 51:31.631
- Oh, my, yes.
- Please.

51:34.675 --> 51:38.179
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
your master of ceremonies,</i>

51:38.262 --> 51:40.973
<i>Caesar Flickerman!</i>

51:43.684 --> 51:47.521
<i>Thank you! Thank you!</i>

51:49.065 --> 51:54.946
<i>Welcome, welcome, welcome
to the 74th Annual Hunger Games!</i>

51:56.155 --> 52:00.284
<i>Now, in about five minutes,
they're all going to be out here.</i>

52:00.368 --> 52:02.954
<i>All of the Tributes that you've heard about.</i>

52:03.037 --> 52:04.413
<i>Are you excited?</i>

52:05.331 --> 52:06.874
<i>Let me hear it!</i>

52:10.211 --> 52:11.462
Amazing.

52:13.172 --> 52:14.674
I don't feel amazing.

52:14.757 --> 52:16.676
Don't you know how beautiful you look?

52:16.759 --> 52:18.594
No. And I don't know
how to make people like me.

52:18.678 --> 52:21.264
- How do you make people like you?
- Well, you made me like you.

52:21.347 --> 52:22.640
That's different. I wasn't trying.

52:22.723 --> 52:26.727
Exactly. Just be yourself,
I'll be there the whole time.

52:27.186 --> 52:30.356
And just pretend
that you're talking to me. Okay?

52:30.690 --> 52:31.691
Okay.

52:31.857 --> 52:33.776
<i>Let's see if she does indeed shine.</i>

52:33.859 --> 52:37.280
<i>Let's have a warm round of applause
for Glimmer!</i>

52:41.909 --> 52:43.494
<i>Glimmer, are you prepared?</i>

52:43.703 --> 52:45.830
<i>Yes, Caesar, I am very prepared.</i>

52:45.913 --> 52:48.666
<i>I like it. That's assurance.
That's self-assurance.</i>

52:48.749 --> 52:49.959
<i>- Don't you think?
- And, as you can see...</i>

52:50.042 --> 52:51.836
<i>...I'm wearing one of our own creations.</i>

52:52.753 --> 52:54.714
<i>A big round of applause!</i>

52:57.341 --> 52:58.551
Marvel!

53:01.721 --> 53:03.180
<i>Welcome, Clove.</i>

53:03.264 --> 53:05.141
- It's an honor representing my district.
- You're a fighter.

53:05.224 --> 53:07.643
I'm prepared. I'm vicious. I'm ready to go.

53:08.853 --> 53:10.062
Cato!

53:10.146 --> 53:13.649
I find that if I can apply myself
to the situation present,

53:13.733 --> 53:15.026
I will be able to figure it out.

53:15.109 --> 53:18.571
<i>Thank you. Lovely to see you.
Thank you so much.</i>

53:21.532 --> 53:23.492
<i>Good. So you can climb trees.</i>

53:23.576 --> 53:25.953
You're pretty quick. And are you a hunter?

53:26.162 --> 53:27.621
<i>A gatherer?</i>

53:34.920 --> 53:37.506
<i>From District 12, District 12...</i>

53:37.590 --> 53:40.760
<i>You know her as The Girl on Fire!</i>

53:43.596 --> 53:46.682
<i>Well, we know her
as the lovely Katniss Everdeen!</i>

54:01.947 --> 54:04.950
<i>Welcome! Welcome.</i>

54:07.536 --> 54:08.788
<i>Welcome.</i>

54:09.580 --> 54:13.125
<i>Well, that was quite an entrance
you made the other day.</i>

54:16.253 --> 54:17.296
What?

54:18.964 --> 54:21.092
I think someone's a little nervous.

54:22.927 --> 54:25.763
I said that was quite an entrance
that you made

54:25.846 --> 54:27.598
at the Tribute Parade the other day.

54:27.681 --> 54:29.850
Do you want to tell us about it?

54:30.726 --> 54:34.230
Well, I was just hoping that
I wouldn't burn to death.

54:42.738 --> 54:44.240
When you came out of that chariot,

54:44.323 --> 54:47.827
I have to say, my heart stopped.

54:48.285 --> 54:50.830
Did any of you experience this as well?

54:50.913 --> 54:52.331
My heart stopped.

54:55.292 --> 54:56.710
So did mine.

54:59.338 --> 55:01.799
Now, tell me about the flames. Are they real?

55:01.882 --> 55:03.008
Yes.

55:07.638 --> 55:11.475
In fact, I'm wearing them today.
Would you like to see?

55:12.685 --> 55:15.312
Wait, wait, wait. Is it safe?

55:15.396 --> 55:16.689
Yes.

55:17.022 --> 55:18.357
What do you think, folks?

55:20.276 --> 55:21.318
I think that's a yes.

55:48.012 --> 55:50.556
Steady. Steady.

55:51.599 --> 55:53.058
Lovely. Thank you.

55:55.478 --> 55:58.689
That was really something.
Katniss, that was something.

55:58.772 --> 56:01.150
That was something. Thank you for that.

56:03.402 --> 56:05.779
I have one more question for you.

56:07.323 --> 56:08.782
It's about your sister.

56:11.494 --> 56:17.583
We were all very moved, I think, when
you volunteered for her at the Reaping.

56:19.752 --> 56:22.296
Did she come and say goodbye to you?

56:22.379 --> 56:23.422
Yes.

56:23.839 --> 56:25.549
- She did.
- She did.

56:28.385 --> 56:31.430
And what did you say to her in the end?

56:34.433 --> 56:36.936
I told her that I would try to win.

56:38.395 --> 56:40.773
That I would try to win for her.

56:41.607 --> 56:43.275
Of course you did.

56:45.110 --> 56:46.737
And try you will.

56:48.030 --> 56:50.533
Ladies and gentlemen, from District 12,

56:50.616 --> 56:54.119
Katniss Everdeen, The Girl on Fire!

57:00.417 --> 57:02.545
You did it, darling. That was incredible.

57:02.628 --> 57:04.046
Thank you.

57:04.129 --> 57:06.590
Nice job, sweetheart.

57:07.341 --> 57:08.634
Thank you.

57:08.717 --> 57:10.302
Nice dress, too.

57:11.470 --> 57:15.015
<i>- Not yours.
- Please welcome Peeta Mellark!</i>

57:21.438 --> 57:23.190
<i>Peeta, welcome.</i>

57:23.607 --> 57:27.403
<i>How are you finding The Capitol?
And don't say, "With a map. "</i>

57:27.486 --> 57:30.114
<i>It's different.
It's very different than back home.</i>

57:30.197 --> 57:33.075
<i>Different. In what way? Give us an example.</i>

57:33.158 --> 57:35.494
<i>Okay. Well, the showers here are weird.</i>

57:35.786 --> 57:36.996
- The showers?
- Yes.

57:37.079 --> 57:38.664
We have different showers.

57:38.789 --> 57:42.751
I have a question for you, Caesar.
Do I smell like roses to you?

57:44.461 --> 57:46.672
- Take a whiff?
- All right.

57:48.507 --> 57:50.217
- You see?
- Yes. Do I smell like it?

57:57.057 --> 57:59.560
- You definitely smell better than I do.
- Well, I've lived here longer.

57:59.643 --> 58:00.811
That makes sense.

58:05.190 --> 58:07.943
Very funny. So, Peeta, tell me,

58:09.028 --> 58:11.614
is there a special girl back home?

58:11.697 --> 58:13.324
No. No. Not really.

58:13.574 --> 58:17.620
No? I don't believe it for a second.
Look at that face.

58:17.703 --> 58:21.665
Handsome man like you. Peeta, tell me.

58:24.043 --> 58:25.544
Well, there...

58:26.045 --> 58:29.381
There is this one girl
that I've had a crush on forever.

58:30.507 --> 58:34.595
But I don't think she actually recognized me
until the Reaping.

58:37.056 --> 58:39.224
Well, I'll tell you what, Peeta.

58:40.726 --> 58:44.188
You go out there and you win this thing,

58:44.647 --> 58:47.900
and when you get home,
she'll have to go out with you.

58:48.484 --> 58:49.610
Right, folks?

58:52.863 --> 58:56.492
Thanks, but I don't think winning's
gonna help me at all.

58:56.575 --> 58:57.951
And why not?

59:01.538 --> 59:03.749
Because she came here with me.

59:08.003 --> 59:09.588
<i>Well, that's bad luck.</i>

59:10.089 --> 59:11.548
<i>Yeah, it is.</i>

59:13.592 --> 59:16.595
<i>- And I wish you all the best of luck.
- Thank you.</i>

59:17.513 --> 59:19.056
<i>Peeta Mellark.</i>

59:20.015 --> 59:21.725
<i>District 12!</i>

59:25.104 --> 59:26.772
What the hell was that?

59:26.855 --> 59:28.857
You don't talk to me,
and then you say you have a crush on me?

59:28.941 --> 59:31.026
You say you want to train alone?
Is that how you want to play?

59:31.110 --> 59:32.736
Stop it! Stop it!

59:32.820 --> 59:33.987
- Let's start right now!
- Hey!

59:35.948 --> 59:38.117
- He did you a favor.
- He made me look weak.

59:38.200 --> 59:42.037
He made you look desirable,
which in your case, can't hurt, sweetheart.

59:42.121 --> 59:43.163
He's right, Katniss.

59:43.247 --> 59:44.456
Of course I'm right.

59:44.707 --> 59:47.960
Now, I can sell the star-crossed lovers
from District 12...

59:48.043 --> 59:49.545
We are not star-crossed lovers.

59:49.628 --> 59:51.380
It's a television show!

59:51.588 --> 59:55.217
And being in love with that boy
might just get you sponsors,

59:55.300 --> 59:57.636
which could save your damn life.

59:58.887 --> 01:00:01.598
Okay. Why don't you get out of here?

01:00:02.307 --> 01:00:05.310
Maybe I can deliver you both
in one piece tomorrow.

01:00:05.394 --> 01:00:06.812
Manners!

01:00:37.885 --> 01:00:39.178
You, too?

01:00:41.305 --> 01:00:42.347
Hey.

01:00:42.765 --> 01:00:43.932
Can't sleep?

01:00:44.016 --> 01:00:45.726
No. Of course not.

01:00:48.312 --> 01:00:50.397
I'm sorry I went after you.

01:00:53.025 --> 01:00:55.360
You know, I meant that as a compliment.

01:00:55.861 --> 01:00:57.070
I know.

01:01:08.373 --> 01:01:09.958
Listen to them.

01:01:11.835 --> 01:01:13.003
Yeah.

01:01:17.341 --> 01:01:19.885
I just don't want them to change me.

01:01:22.805 --> 01:01:24.515
How would they change you?

01:01:27.851 --> 01:01:31.188
I don't know.
They'd turn me into something I'm not.

01:01:33.023 --> 01:01:36.443
I just don't want to be
another piece in their game, you know?

01:01:38.529 --> 01:01:39.988
You mean you won't kill anyone?

01:01:42.324 --> 01:01:43.325
No.

01:01:44.076 --> 01:01:46.829
I mean, I'm sure I would,
just like anybody else

01:01:46.912 --> 01:01:47.996
when the time came,

01:01:49.498 --> 01:01:53.418
but I just keep wishing
that I could think of a way to show them

01:01:53.502 --> 01:01:55.254
that they don't own me.

01:01:58.590 --> 01:02:02.970
If I'm gonna die, I want to still be me.

01:02:08.725 --> 01:02:10.519
Does that make any sense?

01:02:10.602 --> 01:02:11.728
Yeah.

01:02:13.981 --> 01:02:16.191
I just can't afford to think like that.

01:02:20.779 --> 01:02:22.406
I have my sister.

01:02:24.449 --> 01:02:25.951
Yeah, I know.

01:02:40.674 --> 01:02:42.926
I guess I'll see you tomorrow.

01:02:45.762 --> 01:02:47.389
See you tomorrow.

01:03:12.497 --> 01:03:17.502
They'll put all kinds of stuff right in front,
right in the mouth of the Cornucopia.

01:03:17.586 --> 01:03:20.339
There'll even be a bow there. Don't go for it.

01:03:20.422 --> 01:03:21.673
Why not?

01:03:21.757 --> 01:03:23.967
It's a bloodbath.
They're trying to pull you in.

01:03:24.051 --> 01:03:25.469
That's not your game.

01:03:25.552 --> 01:03:29.514
You turn, run, find high ground,
look for water.

01:03:29.598 --> 01:03:31.808
Water's your new best friend.

01:03:32.351 --> 01:03:36.605
Don't step off that pedestal early
or they'll blow you sky high.

01:03:36.688 --> 01:03:37.940
I won't.

01:03:49.993 --> 01:03:53.080
Katniss, you can do this.

01:04:01.213 --> 01:04:02.422
Thanks.

01:04:07.302 --> 01:04:08.929
Give me your arm.

01:04:13.183 --> 01:04:14.434
Give me your arm.

01:04:20.899 --> 01:04:22.734
- Give me your arm.
- What is that?

01:04:25.570 --> 01:04:26.989
Your tracker.

01:04:28.532 --> 01:04:29.533
We're up.

01:04:29.866 --> 01:04:31.118

All right. Less than a minute, people.
Final checks.

01:04:37.582 --> 01:04:39.918
There are 15 out. They are flying.

And, of course,
there's the familiar "boom" of the cannon,

01:11:23.613 --> 01:11:26.658
which marks the end
of another fallen Tribute.

Well, that makes 13 gone

And Claudius,
I think I see an alliance forming.

01:15:12.216 --> 01:15:13.843
Wait! Did you see the look on her face?

01:15:13.926 --> 01:15:15.803
- How stupid can you get?
- A fire?

01:15:15.887 --> 01:15:19.349
"Oh, no! Please don't kill me! Oh, no!"

01:15:19.432 --> 01:15:21.768
That's actually a good impression.

01:15:22.143 --> 01:15:23.269
Hey, lover boy!

01:15:24.771 --> 01:15:27.190
- You sure she went this way?
- Yeah, I'm sure.

01:15:28.232 --> 01:15:29.484
You better be.

01:15:29.567 --> 01:15:32.528
Yeah, that was her snare
we found back there.

01:15:38.242 --> 01:15:40.495
Are you sure we shouldn't just kill him now?

01:15:40.578 --> 01:15:42.413
Nah. He's our best chance of finding her.

01:15:43.581 --> 01:15:44.874

Cueing another. On my count. One, two...

01:17:30.229 --> 01:17:32.273
She's heading towards the left flank.

01:17:32.356 --> 01:17:34.692
Okay. Can you give me a tree right there?

01:17:34.776 --> 01:17:37.403
Sure. Cueing tree.

01:18:29.080 --> 01:18:30.790
She's almost there.

01:18:44.303 --> 01:18:46.639
Lucia, get a cannon ready.

01:18:58.693 --> 01:19:00.194
There she is! There she is!

01:19:02.947 --> 01:19:05.449
- She's mine!
- Not if I get her first!

01:19:09.996 --> 01:19:12.123

- Mine!

Claudius, I think those are tracker jackers

- Those things are very lethal.
- Very.

01:25:14.109 --> 01:25:15.194
For those of you who don't know,

01:25:15.277 --> 01:25:20.532
tracker jackers are genetically engineered
wasps whose venom causes searing pain,

01:25:20.991 --> 01:25:26.163

Not only is it lethal,
but the venom of a tracker jacker sting

01:28:54.037 --> 01:28:55.914
can produce powerful hallucinations.

01:32:07.147 --> 01:32:09.399
And the boy from my district?

01:32:10.317 --> 01:32:13.528
Yeah, he's okay.
I think he's down by the river.

01:32:16.907 --> 01:32:18.617

is gonna smoke like crazy,

move on to the next fire.

Light this one last,

01:32:56.613 --> 01:32:57.823
Right.

01:33:01.118 --> 01:33:04.204
And then I'll destroy their stuff
while they're chasing us.

01:33:04.287 --> 01:33:06.540
We need a signal
in case one of us gets held up.

01:33:06.623 --> 01:33:07.791

01:45:05.049 --> 01:45:06.217
What do you want?

01:45:07.093 --> 01:45:08.719
You have a lot of anger out there.

01:45:08.803 --> 01:45:11.848
I know you know how to handle a mob.
You've done it before.

01:45:11.931 --> 01:45:16.769
If you can't scare them,
give them something to root for.

01:45:17.812 --> 01:45:18.813
Such as?

01:45:21.774 --> 01:45:23.443
Young love.

01:45:24.819 --> 01:45:26.946
So you like an underdog?

01:45:27.029 --> 01:45:28.322
Everyone likes an underdog.

01:45:28.406 --> 01:45:29.657
I don't.

01:45:31.367 --> 01:45:34.454
Have you been out there? 10? 11? 12?

01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:37.915
Not personally. No.

01:45:37.999 --> 01:45:39.417
Well, I have.

01:45:40.585 --> 01:45:42.545
There are lots of underdogs.

01:45:42.628 --> 01:45:44.297
Lots of coal, too.

01:45:44.630 --> 01:45:47.967
Grow crops, minerals, things we need.

01:45:49.802 --> 01:45:52.054
There are lots of underdogs.

01:45:53.055 --> 01:45:55.016
And I think if you could see them,

01:45:56.392 --> 01:45:58.895
you would not root for them either.

01:46:01.355 --> 01:46:02.732
I like you.

01:46:06.068 --> 01:46:07.653
Be careful.

01:46:18.331 --> 01:46:20.583
<i>Attention, Tributes. Attention.</i>

01:46:20.666 --> 01:46:25.505

have been suspended.</i>

01:46:25.588 --> 01:46:27.924
<i>From now on, two victors may be crowned,</i>

01:46:28.007 --> 01:46:31.677
<i>if both originate from the same district.</i>

01:46:31.761 --> 01:46:34.222
<i>This will be the only announcement.</i>

01:46:35.598 --> 01:46:36.891
Peeta.

01:47:37.827 --> 01:47:40.329
Oh, my God! Peeta! Peeta!

01:47:43.416 --> 01:47:44.417
Hi.

01:47:48.212 --> 01:47:49.672
It's okay.

01:48:04.687 --> 01:48:06.105
What was it?

01:48:06.397 --> 01:48:07.690
A sword.

01:48:09.317 --> 01:48:10.860
It's bad, huh?

01:48:11.986 --> 01:48:13.696
It's gonna be fine.

01:48:26.375 --> 01:48:27.835
Katniss.

01:48:31.505 --> 01:48:32.965
- Katniss.
- No!

01:48:34.300 --> 01:48:38.095
I'm not gonna leave you.
I'm not gonna do that.

01:48:45.686 --> 01:48:47.104
Why not?

01:49:07.333 --> 01:49:09.919
Nobody's gonna find you in here.

01:49:10.002 --> 01:49:11.962
They already found me.

01:49:16.092 --> 01:49:17.968
We'll just get you some medicine.

01:49:18.052 --> 01:49:19.887
Katniss, I don't get many parachutes.

01:49:20.846 --> 01:49:22.098
We'll figure something out.

01:49:23.182 --> 01:49:24.517
Like what?

01:49:25.559 --> 01:49:26.936
Something.

01:50:17.433 --> 01:50:19.959
[YOU CALL THAT A KISS? - H]

01:50:28.289 --> 01:50:30.833
- Medicine?
- No. Soup.

01:50:31.667 --> 01:50:32.668
I'll do it.

01:50:43.345 --> 01:50:44.847
That's nice.

01:50:46.849 --> 01:50:48.684
You fed me once.

01:50:51.771 --> 01:50:53.689
I think about that all the time.

01:50:55.483 --> 01:50:57.401
How I tossed you that bread.

01:50:57.485 --> 01:50:59.153
- Peeta...
- I should have gone to you.

01:50:59.236 --> 01:51:01.489
I should have just gone out in the rain and...

01:51:04.575 --> 01:51:06.035
You feel hot.

01:51:08.662 --> 01:51:10.706
I remember the first time I saw you.

01:51:11.957 --> 01:51:13.876
Your hair was in two braids instead of one.

01:51:15.419 --> 01:51:18.464
And I remember when you sang
in the music assembly.

01:51:18.547 --> 01:51:20.925
<i>The teacher said,</i>

01:51:21.008 --> 01:51:23.135
And your hand shot straight up.

01:51:23.219 --> 01:51:24.303
Stop.

01:51:24.553 --> 01:51:28.390
After that,
I watched you going home every day.

01:51:31.393 --> 01:51:32.728
Every day-

01:51:40.569 --> 01:51:42.404
Well, say something.

01:51:45.491 --> 01:51:47.910
I'm not good at saying something.

01:51:49.829 --> 01:51:51.205
Then come here.

01:51:52.873 --> 01:51:54.083
Please.

01:52:06.303 --> 01:52:08.180
Even if I don't make it...

01:52:09.098 --> 01:52:10.182
Stop it.

01:52:16.438 --> 01:52:18.524
<i>Attention, Tributes. Attention.</i>

01:52:19.275 --> 01:52:22.194

01:52:22.278 --> 01:52:23.863
<i>at the Cornucopia.</i>

01:52:23.946 --> 01:52:27.032
<i>This will be no ordinary occasion.</i>

01:52:27.116 --> 01:52:30.870
<i>Each of you needs something desperately.</i>

01:52:30.953 --> 01:52:34.915
<i>And we plan to be generous hosts.</i>

01:52:34.999 --> 01:52:36.542
Your medicine.

01:52:36.625 --> 01:52:37.626
You're not going alone.

01:52:37.793 --> 01:52:39.879
Yeah? You need it, and you can't walk.

01:52:39.962 --> 01:52:42.715
Katniss, you're not gonna risk
your life for me. I'm not gonna let you.

01:52:42.798 --> 01:52:45.801
You would do it for me. Wouldn't you?

01:52:47.761 --> 01:52:49.471
Why are you doing this?

01:53:07.990 --> 01:53:10.242
Now there's no way I'm letting you go.

01:53:10.326 --> 01:53:11.327
Peeta...

01:53:11.410 --> 01:53:12.620
Please.

01:53:13.537 --> 01:53:14.622
Stay.

01:53:19.752 --> 01:53:20.878
Okay.

01:53:22.338 --> 01:53:23.672
I'll stay.

01:54:52.761 --> 01:54:54.096
Oh, God!

01:55:25.461 --> 01:55:27.129
Where's lover boy?

01:55:29.798 --> 01:55:33.635
I see. You were gonna help him, right?

01:55:34.303 --> 01:55:38.891
Well, that's sweet. You know, it's too bad
that you couldn't help your little friend.

01:55:39.475 --> 01:55:41.810
That little girl? What was her name again?

01:55:42.686 --> 01:55:43.771
Rue?

01:55:46.398 --> 01:55:48.442
Yeah, well, we killed her.

01:55:49.151 --> 01:55:52.196
And now we're gonna kill you.

01:55:58.160 --> 01:55:59.453
You kill her?

01:55:59.536 --> 01:56:00.746
- No!
- I heard you!

01:56:00.829 --> 01:56:02.748
- Cato! Cato!
- You said her name!

01:56:02.831 --> 01:56:04.083
You said her name!

01:56:14.843 --> 01:56:16.011
Just this time, 12.

01:56:17.179 --> 01:56:18.222
For Rue.

01:56:34.530 --> 01:56:37.866
Peeta, I got it. I got the medicine.

01:56:38.158 --> 01:56:39.618
- What happened to you?
- I'm fine.

01:56:39.701 --> 01:56:41.120
No, you're not. What happened?

01:56:41.328 --> 01:56:43.622
The girl from 2, she threw a knife. I'm okay.

01:56:43.705 --> 01:56:45.457
You shouldn't have gone.
You said you weren't gonna go.

01:56:45.541 --> 01:56:47.042
You got worse.

01:56:51.213 --> 01:56:52.214
I'm sorry.

01:56:53.757 --> 01:56:55.300
You need some of that, too.

01:56:55.634 --> 01:56:56.885
I'm okay.

01:56:59.888 --> 01:57:01.557
That feels better.

01:57:03.183 --> 01:57:05.310
Okay. Now you.

01:57:05.602 --> 01:57:08.230
- I'm okay.
- No, come on, you need it, too.

01:57:08.313 --> 01:57:09.690
Come on.

01:57:09.773 --> 01:57:11.066
All right.

01:58:10.584 --> 01:58:11.585
Hi.

01:58:14.713 --> 01:58:16.215
You're so much better.

01:58:18.508 --> 01:58:19.843
Oh, my God, Peeta.

01:58:20.969 --> 01:58:22.763
I hardly feel anything.

01:58:23.972 --> 01:58:25.682
We could go home.

01:58:26.600 --> 01:58:29.102
We could. We're the only team left.

01:58:29.728 --> 01:58:31.355
We could go home.

01:58:36.151 --> 01:58:37.819
We know Thresh took off.

01:58:37.903 --> 01:58:39.696
Cato's gonna be by the Cornucopia.

01:58:39.780 --> 01:58:41.823
He's not gonna go someplace
he doesn't know.

01:58:41.907 --> 01:58:45.000
Foxface, she could be anywhere.

01:58:47.037 --> 01:58:50.249
We should probably hunt around here.
We don't have any food left.

01:58:50.332 --> 01:58:51.959
Okay, I'll take the bow.

01:58:54.002 --> 01:58:56.505
I'm just kidding. I'll go pick some stuff.

01:59:14.731 --> 01:59:15.899
Peeta?

01:59:20.445 --> 01:59:21.571
Peeta?

01:59:24.658 --> 01:59:25.826
Peeta!

01:59:27.035 --> 01:59:28.078
Peeta!

01:59:28.161 --> 01:59:29.288
Are you okay?

01:59:29.371 --> 01:59:31.164
- I heard the cannon. I thought...
- No.

01:59:31.248 --> 01:59:34.459
That's Nightlock, Peeta!
You'd be dead in a minute!

01:59:34.543 --> 01:59:35.669
I didn't know.

01:59:35.752 --> 01:59:38.088
You scared me to death. Damn you.

01:59:38.922 --> 01:59:40.257
I'm sorry.

01:59:41.675 --> 01:59:43.051
I'm sorry.

01:59:51.143 --> 01:59:53.312
I never even knew she was following me.

01:59:53.395 --> 01:59:54.896
She's clever.

01:59:55.147 --> 01:59:56.523
Too clever.

01:59:57.858 --> 02:00:01.028
- What are you doing?
- Maybe Cato likes berries, too.

02:00:07.117 --> 02:00:08.618
What time is it?

02:00:08.702 --> 02:00:10.120
A little after noon.

02:00:10.203 --> 02:00:11.288
Why is it getting so dark?

02:00:11.413 --> 02:00:13.040
Must be in a hurry to end it.

02:00:16.460 --> 02:00:19.004
- You ready, Lucia?
- Right here, sir.

02:00:20.380 --> 02:00:22.090
Well, that's great.

02:00:22.591 --> 02:00:23.967
- Now can you put that in the middle?
- Sure.

02:00:33.143 --> 02:00:36.688
That's it. That's excellent.

02:00:48.408 --> 02:00:50.077
Did you hear that?

02:01:22.401 --> 02:01:23.652
What was that?

02:01:24.778 --> 02:01:26.446
It's the finale.

02:01:41.837 --> 02:01:42.838
Let's go.

02:02:51.907 --> 02:02:52.908
Go.

02:03:10.133 --> 02:03:11.134
Katniss!

02:03:36.660 --> 02:03:37.911
Here!

02:04:50.734 --> 02:04:53.194
Go on. Shoot.

02:04:55.655 --> 02:04:57.866
Then we both go down and you'd win.

02:05:01.202 --> 02:05:05.624
Go on. I'm dead anyway.

02:05:10.629 --> 02:05:12.380
I always was, right?

02:05:14.799 --> 02:05:16.843
I didn't know that till now.

02:05:20.180 --> 02:05:22.057
How is that? Is that what they want?

02:05:24.643 --> 02:05:26.645
- No.
- No, no.

02:05:28.355 --> 02:05:29.731
I could still do this.

02:05:31.232 --> 02:05:33.109
I could still do this.

02:05:34.069 --> 02:05:35.945
One more kill.

02:05:38.198 --> 02:05:40.742
It's the only thing I know how to do.

02:05:41.076 --> 02:05:43.286
Bring pride to my district.

02:05:46.956 --> 02:05:48.750
Not that it matters.

02:06:05.266 --> 02:06:06.434
Please!

02:06:08.186 --> 02:06:09.187
No!

02:06:15.944 --> 02:06:16.945
Please!

Go ahead.

02:07:47.619 --> 02:07:49.496
One of us should go home.

02:07:50.330 --> 02:07:53.708
One of us has to die.
They have to have their victor.

02:07:54.292 --> 02:07:55.376
No.

02:07:56.586 --> 02:07:58.004
They don't.

02:07:59.839 --> 02:08:01.049
Why should they?

02:08:02.175 --> 02:08:03.885
- No!
- Trust me.

02:08:04.886 --> 02:08:06.137
Trust me.

02:08:25.031 --> 02:08:26.449
Together?

02:08:27.992 --> 02:08:29.244
Together.

02:08:30.495 --> 02:08:31.579
Okay.

Three.

<i>Stop!</i>

02:08:48.346 --> 02:08:49.597
<i>Stop!</i>

<i>They're not happy with you.</i>

02:09:29.971 --> 02:09:32.015
Why? Because I didn't die?

02:09:32.473 --> 02:09:34.267
Because you showed them up.

02:09:35.143 --> 02:09:37.937
Well, I'm sorry
it didn't go the way they planned.

02:09:38.021 --> 02:09:40.231
- I'm not very happy with them either.
- Katniss!

02:09:40.857 --> 02:09:43.985
This is serious. Notjust for you.

02:09:44.402 --> 02:09:46.529
They don't take these things lightly.

02:10:38.414 --> 02:10:40.750
When they ask,
you say you couldn't help yourself.

02:10:40.833 --> 02:10:43.211
You were so in love with this boy

02:10:43.294 --> 02:10:47.382
that the thought of not being with him
was unthinkable.

02:10:47.548 --> 02:10:51.761
You'd rather die than not be with him.
You understand?

02:10:52.261 --> 02:10:56.724
How did you feel
when you found him by that river?

02:11:01.396 --> 02:11:03.648
I felt like the happiest person in the world.

02:11:07.777 --> 02:11:10.321
I couldn't imagine life without him.

02:11:16.995 --> 02:11:18.621
And what about you, Peeta?

02:11:19.747 --> 02:11:21.457
She saved my life.

02:11:21.541 --> 02:11:22.583
We saved each other.

02:11:24.335 --> 02:11:28.840
Ladies and gentlemen,
the star-crossed lovers from District 12,

02:11:28.923 --> 02:11:34.595
this year's victors
of the 74th Annual Hunger Games!

02:11:51.195 --> 02:11:52.697
Congratulations.

02:11:52.780 --> 02:11:54.115
Thank you.

02:11:59.954 --> 02:12:01.372
What a lovely pin.

02:12:01.456 --> 02:12:03.833
Thank you. It's from my district.

02:12:04.584 --> 02:12:06.878
They must be very proud of you.

02:12:19.682 --> 02:12:22.101
So what happens when we get back?

02:12:23.478 --> 02:12:27.398
I don't know. I guess we try to forget.

02:12:32.278 --> 02:12:34.155
I don't want to forget.
