00:05.205 --> 00:07.374
{\an8}You have never cared!

00:07.440 --> 00:09.442
{\an8}Not until yesterday
did I get a glimpse

00:09.509 --> 00:11.544
{\an7}that you did not have
a support system.

00:11.611 --> 00:14.581
{\an8}I wanted to start off
by saying thank you,

00:14.647 --> 00:15.849
{\an8}and I appreciate you,

00:15.915 --> 00:17.751
{\an7}you know, stepping up,
being here more,

00:17.817 --> 00:19.219
{\an8}because I'm starting
to see a difference.

00:19.285 --> 00:21.221
{\an7}You know I got
"The Lotion" about to drop,

00:21.287 --> 00:23.623
{\an7}shooting a video for it--
you ready for it?

00:23.690 --> 00:25.859
{\an8}I don't think I'm gonna
be able to do your video.

00:25.925 --> 00:28.728
{\an7}You can find someone else
and build a vision around them.

00:28.795 --> 00:32.165
{\an8}In order for you
to realize what you have,

00:32.232 --> 00:33.933
{\an8}you have to be
without me.

00:34.000 --> 00:35.235
{\an8}So you don't wanna
be with me no more?

00:35.301 --> 00:36.636
{\an8}I don't want to be
with you no more.

00:36.703 --> 00:38.705
{\an7}I'm gonna get you
now or later, bitch,

00:38.772 --> 00:40.306
{\an8}and you, too.

00:38.772 --> 00:40.306
{\an8}Oh, her too.

00:40.373 --> 00:41.441
{\an8}Both of you.

00:40.373 --> 00:41.441
{\an8}That's funny.

00:41.508 --> 00:43.410
{\an8}I wish you would.

00:41.508 --> 00:43.410
{\an8}Yeah, both of you.

00:43.476 --> 00:45.011
{\an8}Our fashion show
is in two weeks.

00:45.078 --> 00:46.479
{\an8}Do you think you're
gonna be ready?

00:46.546 --> 00:49.182
{\an7}I feel like I just
let a bus run me over.

00:49.249 --> 00:50.683
{\an7}I've been meeting
with Princess,

00:50.750 --> 00:53.420
{\an7}and she's ready to launch
her swimwear line.

00:53.486 --> 00:55.722
{\an8}And I did hear about
T and Princess' argument.

00:55.789 --> 00:57.891
{\an7}Yeah.

00:55.789 --> 00:57.891
{\an8}So that's the only thing
that concerns me.

00:57.957 --> 01:00.126
{\an7}Don't act like
you (bleep) loyal!

01:00.193 --> 01:02.195
{\an7}You (bleep)
unloyal-ass bitch!

01:02.262 --> 01:03.496
{\an8}You disrespect everybody.

01:03.563 --> 01:04.497
{\an8}(bleep) you.

01:04.563 --> 01:05.799
{\an8}I hope
you mother (bleep)

01:05.865 --> 01:06.866

Believe it or not,
but our little boy is

01:49.242 --> 01:51.444
{\an8}about to start
kindergarten-- it's crazy.

01:51.511 --> 01:53.480
{\an8}And since things have been
good with Moniece lately,

01:53.546 --> 01:55.915
{\an8}I figure we can go school
shopping together.

01:55.982 --> 01:57.417
{\an3}Hola, hola.

01:55.982 --> 01:57.417
{\an1}What up?

01:57.484 --> 01:59.018
What's going on?

01:59.085 --> 02:01.721
{\an1}Man, trying to find
these clothes for this boy.

02:01.788 --> 02:03.823
My baby's going
to kindergarten.

02:03.890 --> 02:05.592
{\an1}I know,
isn't it crazy?

02:05.658 --> 02:06.659
I'm devastated.

02:06.726 --> 02:07.861
I'm kinda feeling
this whole

02:07.927 --> 02:09.863
functional
co-parenting thing.

02:09.929 --> 02:12.098
I mean, that's the way
it should be, right?

02:12.165 --> 02:14.467
So I figure, since I'm doing
something nice, you know,

02:14.534 --> 02:17.203
that maybe she could do
something nice for me in return.

02:17.270 --> 02:18.571
These for you.

02:18.638 --> 02:19.639
I could probably
fit those.

02:19.706 --> 02:21.007
{\an3}Let me see.

02:21.074 --> 02:22.275
So I got an idea.

02:22.342 --> 02:23.843
{\an1}How about you
listen to this one?

02:23.910 --> 02:24.944
{\an3}Okay.

02:25.011 --> 02:26.045
{\an1}To keep your face
out there,

02:26.112 --> 02:28.548
to help you help me...

02:26.112 --> 02:28.548
{\an3}Uh-huh.

02:28.615 --> 02:31.985
{\an1}I would like you to be
the feature girl in my video.

02:32.051 --> 02:33.253
{\an3}What?

02:33.319 --> 02:34.621
{\an1}I know you're not
a video girl,

02:34.687 --> 02:36.556
{\an1}and I don't want you to think
like that, you feel me?

02:36.623 --> 02:37.824
{\an3}Okay, so...

02:37.891 --> 02:39.192
do you need
an answer now?

02:39.259 --> 02:41.160
{\an1}Yeah, I do,
'cause it's Wednesday.

02:42.929 --> 02:44.230
Oh-- oh, my God.

Drew asking me to be
the feature girl

02:49.202 --> 02:51.437
{\an8}in his "Good Lotion" video
is absolutely

02:51.504 --> 02:52.972
{\an8}blowing my mind
right now.

02:53.039 --> 02:55.108
When we're getting along
like this, it's great,

02:55.174 --> 02:58.478
but it also makes me kind of sad
for what could have been.

02:58.545 --> 02:59.646
I know I'm with Rich
right now,

02:59.712 --> 03:00.914
and I love him to death,

03:00.980 --> 03:02.415
but looking at Drew,

03:02.482 --> 03:04.617
some of those old feelings are
starting to come back.

03:04.684 --> 03:07.720
You've been
very supportive.

03:07.787 --> 03:11.357
I'm going to return
the favor and support you.

03:11.424 --> 03:12.692
{\an1}I'm gonna make sure,
you know,

03:12.759 --> 03:14.294
the red carpet is
laid out for you.

03:14.360 --> 03:16.129
Hair and makeup is there,

03:16.195 --> 03:18.398
{\an1}your M&amp;Ms is all yellow,
you feel me?

03:18.464 --> 03:20.667
You know
I don't like yellow.

03:20.733 --> 03:22.535
{\an1}Well, then they red,
(bleep), whatever.

03:22.602 --> 03:25.104
{\an1}Send your rider
over to the director,

03:25.171 --> 03:26.372
we have it all straight,

03:26.439 --> 03:27.507
{\an1}I'll make sure
you good, though.

03:27.574 --> 03:28.541

{\an3}All right.

What's going on

{\an1}I'm single,
still playing the field.

03:32.579 --> 03:34.914

like, you got, like,

03:34.981 --> 03:36.583
one or two
on the table,

03:36.649 --> 03:38.484
and you're trying to figure out
if that's where you want to be,

03:38.551 --> 03:40.019
{\an5}or is it like...

03:38.551 --> 03:40.019
No, I'm just dating,

03:40.086 --> 03:42.589
{\an1}like, exploring
my options.

03:42.655 --> 03:44.490
I like options, you know,
like, when you get a car,

03:44.557 --> 03:45.892
{\an1}you got
all the options?

03:45.959 --> 03:47.827
Would I happen to know
any of these cars

gonna beat anybody up.

04:36.442 --> 04:37.810
{\an8}and we went

and all this temptation,
I mean, it's in my face,

but it just don't compare
to what me and Princess had,

04:59.532 --> 05:00.967
'cause what we had
was special,

05:01.034 --> 05:02.669

It is real, though.
It's too real.

acknowledge that.

05:45.078 --> 05:46.345

sleeping with
two women a month,

05:48.481 --> 05:51.050
I'm not even sleeping

With all the (bleep)

I could definitely use
a friend to talk to,

06:54.680 --> 06:56.682
{\an8}so I reached out
to my girl T.T.

are you gonna tell Rich?

I don't really know
what to do or say

08:06.018 --> 08:08.020
or how to take
this whole thing,

conflicting feelings

how to deal with it,

08:13.326 --> 08:14.961

talking to him

will help me
figure it out.

08:16.362 --> 08:17.797
I don't know
if it's because

08:17.864 --> 08:19.332
Rich and I haven't
figured out, like,

08:19.398 --> 08:21.200
what we're doing,
and I feel like

08:21.267 --> 08:22.501
we talk about
getting married,

through the back

{\an8}this was gonna be a tough thing

of my little broken heart,

13:14.093 --> 13:15.594
he's been through hell,

13:15.661 --> 13:18.430

a drop of patience.

13:28.641 --> 13:29.942
{\an5}Okay.

13:28.641 --> 13:29.942

to my sisters.

13:30.009 --> 13:31.810
Oh, really?

13:31.877 --> 13:34.780

taking that?

the situation.

13:46.225 --> 13:48.727
{\an1}Okay.

13:48.794 --> 13:50.596
And the reason
why I told her

13:50.663 --> 13:54.266
was because
I wanted her to--

13:54.333 --> 13:55.734
Well, I was trying
to protect her.

13:55.801 --> 13:56.902
{\an4}Okay.

13:55.801 --> 13:56.902
And me,
as a mother--

13:56.969 --> 13:58.070
{\an1}So you felt like
somebody would have

13:58.137 --> 13:59.471
told a child that?

13:58.137 --> 13:59.471
{\an3}Yes--

13:59.538 --> 14:02.408
or might have been talking,
how adults talk around kids,

14:02.474 --> 14:04.210
and I didn't want her
to overhear something

14:04.276 --> 14:06.045
about her father
figure, okay?

14:06.111 --> 14:07.346
I didn't want her to hear
something about the man

14:07.413 --> 14:09.448
that she chose
to love as a father

14:09.515 --> 14:11.283
and she thinks of
as her dad.

14:11.350 --> 14:13.719
I had to make that
right decision for Zoey.

14:13.786 --> 14:15.654
{\an5}(Miles)
I'm not gonna lie,
Amber breaking the news

14:15.721 --> 14:18.057
to Zoey
without me...

14:18.123 --> 14:19.825
I felt bad about that,

14:19.892 --> 14:21.727
but I understand
why Amber had to do it,

14:21.794 --> 14:22.995
and I know
it wasn't easy.

14:23.062 --> 14:24.763
{\an1}I'm--
I'm just so sorry,

14:24.830 --> 14:26.765
{\an1}like, I wish
I didn't even have--

14:26.832 --> 14:28.067
{\an1}I wish we wasn't
going through this.

14:28.133 --> 14:29.335
{\an1}I wish I didn't have
these feelings,

14:29.401 --> 14:30.869
{\an5}I swear to God, like--

14:29.401 --> 14:30.869
And I hear you.

14:30.936 --> 14:32.605
I just want you to put

14:32.671 --> 14:34.640
all the hurt
that you did to me

14:34.707 --> 14:37.176
and everything
that I did to you

14:37.243 --> 14:39.011
in the past,
like, behind us.

14:39.078 --> 14:40.679
{\an1}Right.

14:39.078 --> 14:40.679
Now I'm gonna move on

14:40.746 --> 14:41.947
and find my happy

14:42.014 --> 14:44.016
and gain my happy again
in my life,

14:44.083 --> 14:45.784
with whoever
I choose to be with

14:45.851 --> 14:47.987
and whoever I move
forward with, you know?

14:48.053 --> 14:51.290
So with that being said,
you know, it's okay.

14:51.357 --> 14:53.158
I wanted to
let you know that,

14:53.225 --> 14:54.994
right now,
we're good on that part,

14:55.060 --> 14:56.662
and I'm glad
that, you know,

14:56.729 --> 14:58.464
you're finally
living in your truth,

14:58.530 --> 14:59.565
and, you know,

14:59.632 --> 15:01.100
you're happy
with who you are,

15:01.166 --> 15:02.301
and I'm happy.

15:02.368 --> 15:03.802
{\an1}I'm-- I'm still getting
happy with who I am.

15:03.869 --> 15:05.671
{\an1}Well, and guess what?
And it's going to take time,

15:05.738 --> 15:07.273
because it's
something new for you,

15:07.339 --> 15:09.842
and my sympathy is
with you.

15:09.908 --> 15:12.611
It's such a relief
to hear Amber being strong

15:12.678 --> 15:15.214
and just figuring out a way
to still include me in her life.

15:15.281 --> 15:16.649
It'll take time,
for sure,

15:16.715 --> 15:18.083
but now,
when I look to the future,

15:18.150 --> 15:20.452
it's finally starting
to seem a little bright.

15:20.519 --> 15:22.187
So, we'll just
go from there.

15:22.254 --> 15:23.856
{\an1}Thank you for
meeting up with me today.

15:23.922 --> 15:25.257

I've begun to have these
conflicting feelings,

16:24.683 --> 16:27.353
and I'm not really sure where
they're coming from or why.

16:27.419 --> 16:29.121
It's almost like...

16:29.188 --> 16:31.824

16:31.890 --> 16:33.525

I wanted him to be.

to tell you something.

16:46.638 --> 16:48.540
{\an1}What?

16:48.607 --> 16:50.909
Since we've been
able to get along

16:50.976 --> 16:53.112
and co-parent,

16:53.178 --> 16:55.848
and things are
going good,

16:55.914 --> 16:59.385
I'm starting
to remember

16:59.451 --> 17:01.954
the man that
I fell in love with

17:02.020 --> 17:05.124
and now that
I'm getting the hang of

17:05.190 --> 17:07.358
juggling work
and Mommy duty again,

17:07.425 --> 17:09.361
and the fact that
you're there this time

17:09.428 --> 17:10.896
to be supportive,

17:10.963 --> 17:12.865
it's the first time
that I've had a chance to,

17:12.931 --> 17:14.400
like, be honest
with myself--

17:14.465 --> 17:15.968
like,
I still love you,

17:16.034 --> 17:17.469
I will always
love you,

17:17.536 --> 17:19.171
and I can't help
but to think

17:19.238 --> 17:23.409
what life would
be like as a family.

17:23.474 --> 17:24.675
I just wanted
to know, like,

17:24.742 --> 17:26.545
do those thoughts

17:26.612 --> 17:30.115
ever, like,
cross your mind?

17:30.182 --> 17:32.451
{\an1}I don't know
if I really see us,

17:32.518 --> 17:34.186
{\an1}like...

17:34.253 --> 17:35.821
{\an1}in that--
that space again,

17:35.888 --> 17:39.191
you know, because
I fell out of love

17:39.258 --> 17:41.193
{\an1}five years ago,
you know?

17:41.260 --> 17:43.929
{\an1}And you know,
I feel like

17:43.996 --> 17:45.330
{\an1}even if we was
to try that,

17:45.397 --> 17:47.232
{\an1}as good as
things are right now,

17:47.299 --> 17:48.600
{\an1}it'll only go
backwards.

17:48.667 --> 17:50.769
When I set out
to make things right

17:50.836 --> 17:52.671
between me and Moniece
for Cam's sake,

17:52.738 --> 17:54.907
this was the last thing
I expected.

17:54.973 --> 17:56.575
I enjoy the space
we're in now,

17:56.642 --> 17:57.976
you know,
being friends

17:58.043 --> 18:00.813
and us being able to communicate
and work things out.

18:00.879 --> 18:04.082
It's better for Cameron,
and I don't really see myself

18:04.149 --> 18:05.818
going back into
a place of trying to be

18:05.884 --> 18:10.055
in a real relationship
with her because that was...

18:10.122 --> 18:12.257
I just feel like
that would be detrimental

18:12.324 --> 18:13.592
to the situation.

18:13.659 --> 18:15.928
{\an1}I think I'm more in a space
where I just feel like,

18:15.994 --> 18:18.964
{\an1}you know, us being able
to co-parent, be friends,

18:19.031 --> 18:22.067
I think where we're at is
what's best for Cameron.

18:22.134 --> 18:24.470
{\an5}(Moniece)
I know it sounds crazy
given our past,

18:24.536 --> 18:26.405
but I just want
a loving, functional family

18:26.472 --> 18:27.906
to raise our child,

18:27.973 --> 18:30.108
and I want us to be able
to support one another.

18:30.175 --> 18:32.311
I guess some damage
just can't be undone.

18:32.377 --> 18:36.615
{\an1}I've waited for this day,
like, that we could be here,

18:36.682 --> 18:38.450
like, this is the person

18:38.517 --> 18:43.055
that I planned
at 21, 22,

18:43.121 --> 18:45.757
to be with forever.

18:47.092 --> 18:49.528
{\an1}From the moment
I found out I was pregnant,

18:49.595 --> 18:50.729
this is what
I envisioned.

18:50.796 --> 18:52.764
I envisioned two parents
who could get along,

18:52.831 --> 18:54.700
so all these
feelings are,

18:54.766 --> 18:58.270
like... coming up,

18:58.337 --> 18:59.738
and I don't
really know, like,

18:59.805 --> 19:00.973
how to process them,

19:01.039 --> 19:03.375
and I just don't know
how to take it.

19:03.442 --> 19:06.945
Like, what if, like...

19:07.012 --> 19:08.514
I just...
the 'what if" is,

19:08.580 --> 19:10.949
just, like,
the worst part.

19:11.016 --> 19:14.753
It's like,
what if I never left?

19:14.820 --> 19:16.522
{\an1}You can't ask yourself
the "what ifs,"

19:16.588 --> 19:18.624
{\an1}'cause you're only
gonna drive yourself

19:18.690 --> 19:20.726
{\an1}back into those--
those emotions,

19:20.792 --> 19:22.728
{\an4}and it's like,
that's not healthy,
you know?

19:22.794 --> 19:25.564
{\an5}Yeah.

19:22.794 --> 19:25.564
You gotta move
to what's now.

19:25.631 --> 19:27.065
{\an1}And what's now is
we're happy,

19:27.132 --> 19:28.634
and we're friends.

19:28.700 --> 19:31.436
I'm glad that me and Moniece
can get along and coexist,

19:31.503 --> 19:33.705
you know, to be
better parents to our son,

19:33.772 --> 19:35.107
but I'm just
in a different place

19:35.173 --> 19:36.275
in my life
right now,

19:36.341 --> 19:38.210
and that kind of love
for Moniece

19:38.277 --> 19:39.912
will just
never be there again.

19:39.978 --> 19:42.147
We're in a good zone,
let's just be happy,

19:42.214 --> 19:43.615

19:43.682 --> 19:44.750
{\an1}to be the best
he could be,

19:44.816 --> 19:47.119
{\an1}and let's just win,
you feel me?

19:47.185 --> 19:48.353
{\an3}All right.

confessed her love for me.

really interesting

I don't blame her for having
feelings for her baby daddy.

have a child together,

excusing myself

21:24.983 --> 21:27.519
for them to make
their family work, I would.

21:27.586 --> 21:28.787
I'm really surprised,

21:28.854 --> 21:30.689
because I thought
it was just--

21:30.756 --> 21:32.224
I thought she was
in a new relationship,

21:32.290 --> 21:33.725
{\an3}and that--

21:32.290 --> 21:33.725
Yeah, but--

21:33.792 --> 21:36.395
{\an6}You know?

21:33.792 --> 21:36.395
{\an1}She has, like,
these flashbacks,

21:36.461 --> 21:38.263
{\an1}'cause I've been
so supportive

21:38.330 --> 21:40.032
{\an4}and, you know,
helping her out.

21:38.330 --> 21:40.032
{\an3}Yeah.

21:40.098 --> 21:41.600
So what did you say
when she told you?

21:41.667 --> 21:43.535
{\an1}I told her, you know,
I think where we at is,

21:43.602 --> 21:44.970
{\an1}like, great for
Cameron right now,

21:45.037 --> 21:47.472
{\an1}like, he's getting
to see us get along,

21:47.539 --> 21:48.507
you know what I mean?

21:47.539 --> 21:48.507
{\an3}Yeah.

21:48.573 --> 21:50.075
{\an1}I like it as,
like, where it's at.

21:50.142 --> 21:53.512
{\an4}I don't want to be, like,
reminiscing and going back
to that--

21:53.578 --> 21:55.414
{\an1}So you don't think you could
ever try to work it out?

21:55.480 --> 21:56.982
{\an5}That's not happening.

21:55.480 --> 21:56.982
Not even for your son?

21:57.049 --> 21:59.418
{\an6}Really?

21:57.049 --> 21:59.418
I love him-- I love
the space we're in.

21:59.484 --> 22:01.386
{\an1}It's a good space
for us.

22:07.993 --> 22:10.395
{\an8}(Ray J)
After talking to Max,
I realized,

22:10.462 --> 22:12.330
{\an8}women like Princess,

22:12.397 --> 22:14.032
{\an8}they don't come around
this often.

22:14.099 --> 22:15.534
{\an8}I never felt
this kind of love

22:15.600 --> 22:17.703
{\an8}with anybody else
I ever been with.

22:17.769 --> 22:19.171
Maybe she's over me.

22:19.237 --> 22:21.773
But maybe there's
some love left in her heart,

22:21.840 --> 22:23.241
and she'll let me back in.

22:27.045 --> 22:29.214
{\an6}Who is it?

22:27.045 --> 22:29.214
Who you think it is?

22:32.317 --> 22:33.885
Hello.

22:33.952 --> 22:35.854
{\an5}(Princess)
I don't know what the hell
Ray is doing here.

22:35.921 --> 22:38.390
{\an8}I've been working day and night
on my swimsuit line,

22:38.457 --> 22:39.991
{\an8}getting ready
for this fashion show,

22:40.058 --> 22:42.027
and I don't have time
to deal with Ray.

22:42.094 --> 22:43.795
Yeah, show me
your (bleep).

22:43.862 --> 22:45.831
Yeah, I'm-- yeah,
I'm working on my line.

22:45.897 --> 22:47.232
{\an5}I got a fashion show
coming up.

22:45.897 --> 22:47.232
Can I get a hug?

22:50.302 --> 22:51.670
Missed you,
Princess.

22:54.639 --> 22:56.174
You know, active.

22:56.241 --> 22:58.043
{\an1}Yeah?

22:56.241 --> 22:58.043
Yeah, how you been?

22:58.110 --> 23:00.078
{\an1}Just working on
my-- my line.

23:00.145 --> 23:01.780
You know I'm gonna
come through and support.

23:01.847 --> 23:02.948
Like, I can't wait.

23:03.014 --> 23:04.649
{\an5}No.

23:03.014 --> 23:04.649
I got gift bags.

23:04.716 --> 23:06.384
I can't do it.
I can't.

23:06.451 --> 23:08.820
You can't be there.
Sorry.

23:08.887 --> 23:10.989
You got some other
mother (bleep) there?

23:11.056 --> 23:12.224
You mean a man?

23:12.290 --> 23:13.458
Yeah, why can't I come?

23:13.525 --> 23:15.127
{\an1}I'm just--
I'm not there right now,

23:15.193 --> 23:17.329
{\an1}mentally,

23:17.395 --> 23:18.997
and I just, like,
I went to Texas,

23:19.064 --> 23:20.565
{\an1}I went to visit
my family.

23:20.632 --> 23:21.566
What happened?

23:21.633 --> 23:22.901
{\an1}You know,
I haven't seen my dad

23:22.968 --> 23:24.069
{\an1}in, like,
over ten years.

23:24.136 --> 23:26.304
And...

23:31.209 --> 23:32.144
Come on.

23:32.210 --> 23:34.412
{\an1}No, no, no,
let's-- let's talk.

23:34.479 --> 23:36.181
Come on, baby.

23:37.849 --> 23:39.184
{\an1}I just...

23:39.251 --> 23:40.619
I'm starting to realize

23:40.685 --> 23:42.921
that the issue is
deeper than you.

23:44.923 --> 23:48.160
{\an1}A lot of the reason I have
been putting up with your stuff,

23:48.226 --> 23:49.828
{\an1}and, like,
I won't leave

23:49.895 --> 23:53.064
{\an1}is because, like,
I have deeper issues,

23:53.131 --> 23:54.800
like, with my dad.

23:54.866 --> 23:57.602
{\an1}And it's like
I look to you to,

23:57.669 --> 23:59.704
like, fill that void.

23:59.771 --> 24:01.506
{\an1}And I can't do that
because I'm just always

24:01.573 --> 24:06.111
{\an1}gonna be disappointed
because you disappoint me.

24:06.178 --> 24:08.380
{\an5}(Princess)
There will always
be a piece of my heart

24:08.446 --> 24:09.614
reserved for Ray,

24:09.681 --> 24:11.449
but I just owe it
to myself

24:11.516 --> 24:13.485
and the woman that
I know that I can become

24:13.552 --> 24:16.555
to bring more positivity
and freedom into my life,

24:16.621 --> 24:17.923
and that means...

24:17.989 --> 24:21.860
leaving the woman
that I was with him behind.

24:21.927 --> 24:23.562
{\an1}So now that you know
what I'm doing,

24:23.628 --> 24:25.130
can you please
just respect me

24:25.197 --> 24:27.098
{\an1}and give me some space
until this is over with?

24:27.165 --> 24:28.333
But I'm saying,
like, I--

24:28.400 --> 24:30.902
I want another, like,
chance with us to, like,

24:30.969 --> 24:32.604
at least
be friends

24:32.671 --> 24:33.805
{\an3}and, like,
hang out,

24:33.872 --> 24:36.107
and try to figure
this (bleep) out.

24:36.174 --> 24:38.143
I'm happy that
you stopped by,

24:38.210 --> 24:39.578
but I need you

24:39.644 --> 24:42.214
to just respect

24:42.280 --> 24:43.582
{\an1}what I'm doing
right now

24:43.648 --> 24:45.951
{\an1}and just give me
some time, you know?

24:46.017 --> 24:47.686
{\an3}Okay.

24:47.752 --> 24:48.820
Shine, baby.

24:54.893 --> 24:56.294
{\an7}You put this whole
(bleep) show together.

24:56.361 --> 24:57.896
{\an8}You got all these
people coming here

24:57.963 --> 24:59.664
{\an7}to support you,
and you just go...

24:59.731 --> 25:01.132
{\an8}I'm cool.

25:01.199 --> 25:02.334
{\an8}I don't want
to do it no more,

25:02.400 --> 25:04.035
{\an8}and I'm over it.

25:04.102 --> 25:05.537
{\an8}I don't want to hear
nothing you have to say,

25:05.604 --> 25:07.072
{\an8}because you're not
worth acknowledging.

25:07.138 --> 25:09.608
{\an7}You can let it go in one ear
and out the other.

25:09.674 --> 25:12.010
{\an9}Oh.

25:09.674 --> 25:12.010
{\an7}You got some
(bleep) nerve.

25:18.416 --> 25:21.152
♪♪

25:24.356 --> 25:26.124
{\an5}(Brandi)
Things just haven't been
the same for me

25:26.191 --> 25:29.961
ever since I found out
my little sister Amber has M.S.

25:30.028 --> 25:31.830
I love her so much,

25:31.897 --> 25:34.165
and to see her
suffering like this

25:34.232 --> 25:37.002
just rips my heart
directly out of my chest.

25:37.068 --> 25:38.770
It kills me inside.

25:38.837 --> 25:41.940
And despite all the crazy things
that are going on between us,

25:42.007 --> 25:43.608
Max is my rock,

25:43.675 --> 25:46.344
and right now,
I need him more than ever.

25:46.411 --> 25:48.413
It's a nice day
to walk on the beach.

25:48.480 --> 25:51.383
I really appreciate
you supporting us

25:51.449 --> 25:53.218
and the family.

25:53.285 --> 25:55.587
And for all the stuff
going on with Amber,

25:55.654 --> 25:57.022
{\an3}and then...

25:57.088 --> 25:58.590
{\an1}It's okay.

25:57.088 --> 25:58.590
Amber being sick.

25:59.925 --> 26:01.860
{\an8}I don't understand
what's going on,

26:01.927 --> 26:03.895
{\an8}but thank you
for supporting me.

26:03.962 --> 26:06.131
{\an1}It's a lot going on
right now,

26:06.197 --> 26:08.867
{\an1}but at the end of the day,
we gonna stay strong.

26:08.934 --> 26:10.468
{\an1}We're gonna get
through it, you know?

26:10.535 --> 26:13.038
{\an5}(Max)
I know it can't be easy
for B to see her sister

26:13.104 --> 26:14.539
go through so much pain,

26:14.606 --> 26:16.374
{\an8}especially since it's
all happening out of thin air

26:16.441 --> 26:18.076
{\an8}and escalated so fast.

26:18.143 --> 26:19.477
And as much as
it hurts me to see them

26:19.544 --> 26:21.112
both suffering so much,

26:21.179 --> 26:22.781
{\an5}I still gotta
be strong for B

26:22.847 --> 26:24.516
and show her I always
got her back.

26:24.582 --> 26:27.619
You know I hate
admitting when I'm wrong.

26:27.686 --> 26:29.087
{\an1}Oh, yeah,
you hate that.

26:29.154 --> 26:32.223
But I was wrong
about our rings,

26:32.290 --> 26:33.758
because they are
very beautiful,

26:33.825 --> 26:36.361
but I do understand
what you mean about

26:36.428 --> 26:38.563
it being
just a material,

26:38.630 --> 26:40.498
and what we--
what we really have,

26:40.565 --> 26:43.001
what holds our marriage
is here.

26:43.068 --> 26:44.669
{\an1}No, it's all good,
we're gonna get through this

26:44.736 --> 26:46.171
{\an1}and walk off
into the sunset,

26:46.237 --> 26:48.573
{\an5}I'mma carry you--

26:46.237 --> 26:48.573
(squeals)

26:48.640 --> 26:50.141
Walk off in the sunset,

26:50.208 --> 26:51.843
I'm gonna hold you
to that now.

26:51.910 --> 26:53.545
{\an4}Yeah.

26:51.910 --> 26:53.545
Even when you get mad.

26:53.611 --> 26:54.879
Can I drop you
in the water?

26:54.946 --> 26:56.715
No, no.

27:02.554 --> 27:04.556
{\an8}What you doing here?

27:07.225 --> 27:08.827
(quiet chatter)

27:10.662 --> 27:12.263
(Hazel-E)
Today is finally the day

27:12.330 --> 27:13.932
that we've been
planning for weeks.

27:13.999 --> 27:16.301
The fashion show is
finally here,

27:16.368 --> 27:18.336
{\an8}and, of course, day of,

27:18.403 --> 27:19.938
{\an8}there's always
a million and one things

27:20.005 --> 27:21.339
{\an8}that need to be done,

27:21.406 --> 27:23.808
but I think that I have
all of my ducks in a row,

27:23.875 --> 27:26.244
and I'm ready
to see this little catwalk

27:26.311 --> 27:28.380
turn up, baby.

27:30.548 --> 27:32.017
Just when
I thought everything

27:32.083 --> 27:34.319
was finally running
smoothly,

27:34.386 --> 27:35.754
I get a text
from Teairra's ass,

27:35.820 --> 27:37.455
and that (bleep)
threw me.

27:37.522 --> 27:40.325
She said she was on her way
to come and crash my event

27:40.392 --> 27:42.494
to get even for
what happened at the fitting.

27:42.560 --> 27:44.562
This bitch got me
(bleep) up.

27:44.629 --> 27:45.864
(man)
Out the door first.

27:45.930 --> 27:47.766
That way.

27:50.068 --> 27:51.703
I thought you were gonna be
here when it's over.

27:51.770 --> 27:53.705
Um, I'm not gonna be here
when it's over, so.

27:53.772 --> 27:54.973
Oh, okay.

27:55.040 --> 27:56.508
Thank you guys.

27:56.574 --> 27:59.310
{\an5}(Hazel-E)
All this drama,
all this bull (bleep),

27:59.377 --> 28:01.279
I'm just not here
for it anymore.

28:01.346 --> 28:02.447
I know T.T. just wants

28:02.514 --> 28:04.682
some big-ass messy
confrontation,

28:04.749 --> 28:07.085
but today is not
the time or place.

28:07.152 --> 28:08.987
I put on a bomb-ass show,

28:09.054 --> 28:10.321
and I'm not
finna sit here

28:10.388 --> 28:12.524
and watch my event
turn to trash,

28:12.590 --> 28:15.093
so it's time for me
to peace the (bleep) out.

28:16.761 --> 28:18.630
{\an1}You put this whole
(bleep) show together.

28:18.696 --> 28:20.598
{\an1}You got all these people
coming here to support you,

28:20.665 --> 28:22.600
and you just go...

28:20.665 --> 28:22.600
{\an3}Quit?

28:22.667 --> 28:23.802
But it's still, like...

28:23.868 --> 28:25.370
{\an3}I'm cool.

28:25.437 --> 28:26.938
I don't want
to do it no more,

28:27.005 --> 28:28.740
and I'm over it.

28:28.807 --> 28:31.109
Hazel got some kind of
threatening text from Teairra,

28:31.176 --> 28:32.577
and she decided
to leave.

28:32.644 --> 28:34.079
I can't believe
she's just gonna take off

28:34.145 --> 28:36.114
and leave the event
on autopilot.

28:36.181 --> 28:39.117
{\an8}This is not cool,
this is not Hazel.

28:42.654 --> 28:44.622
Yo, come here.

28:44.689 --> 28:46.324
{\an1}Come here.

28:44.689 --> 28:46.324
What's up, honey?

28:46.391 --> 28:47.992
{\an1}Why did Hazel
just (bleep) leave?

28:48.059 --> 28:49.594
You're joking.
She's coming back, right?

28:49.661 --> 28:51.196
{\an1}No, I'm dead-ass serious,
she's talking about

28:51.262 --> 28:52.564
{\an1}she heard that
Teairra was on her way.

28:52.630 --> 28:53.798
How is she leaving--
this is her event.

28:53.865 --> 28:55.333
{\an5}That's what I'm saying.

28:53.865 --> 28:55.333
So she just left.

28:55.400 --> 28:56.768
{\an1}She said,
"Teairra's coming,"

28:56.835 --> 28:58.069
{\an1}she found out
Teairra was on her way,

28:58.136 --> 28:59.471
{\an1}and she didn't
wanna be bothered,

28:59.537 --> 29:00.738
{\an8}if she's gonna be here.

28:59.537 --> 29:00.738
{\an8}So she's scared of Teairra?

29:00.805 --> 29:01.773
{\an7}I don't know
what the (bleep), like,

29:01.840 --> 29:02.941
{\an7}who gives a (bleep)
about Teairra?

29:03.007 --> 29:04.442
{\an1}Like, why would
she leave the event?

29:04.509 --> 29:06.411
{\an8}(Nikki)
I simply cannot believe

29:06.478 --> 29:07.879
{\an8}that Hazel is
just walking away,

29:07.946 --> 29:09.147
{\an8}quitting the show.

29:09.214 --> 29:10.615
{\an8}But (bleep),
we got all these

29:10.682 --> 29:12.283
{\an8}fabulous models
dressed up,

29:12.350 --> 29:13.852
we're gonna send them
down the runway

29:13.918 --> 29:15.487
and it's gonna be
fabulous,

29:15.553 --> 29:16.721
with or without her.

29:16.788 --> 29:20.024
I mean, you still got
Nikki here and Princess,

29:20.091 --> 29:21.159
{\an6}so (bleep).

29:20.091 --> 29:21.159
{\an1}Yo, we gonna
have to kill this.

29:21.226 --> 29:22.427
I mean,
this is a fashion show.

29:22.494 --> 29:24.462
We're the ones with
the fashion line, so...

29:24.529 --> 29:26.664
{\an6}Yeah.

29:24.529 --> 29:26.664
We're gonna have
to kill it off.

29:26.731 --> 29:28.066
{\an1}Ugh.

29:26.731 --> 29:28.066
We will kill it off.

29:28.133 --> 29:29.534
Don't sound
so depressed.

29:29.601 --> 29:31.336
All right, (bleep).

29:39.377 --> 29:40.678
(Moniece)
After all the drama with Drew,

29:40.745 --> 29:42.213
I needed
a little distraction,

29:42.280 --> 29:44.749
so when Teairra asked me to be
a part of her revenge plot

29:44.816 --> 29:46.184
{\an8}against Frick and Frack,

29:46.251 --> 29:48.520
{\an8}of course you know I had
to give a little inside help,

29:48.586 --> 29:50.088
{\an8}like Pinky and the Brain.

29:50.155 --> 29:52.924
So, as they say,
let the games begin.

30:13.912 --> 30:15.680
{\an8}(Teairra)
Guess who, bitches?

30:15.747 --> 30:17.482
{\an8}You didn't think
that your girl T.T.

30:17.549 --> 30:19.117
{\an8}was gonna
just stand by

30:19.184 --> 30:20.652
{\an8}and let my fashion show

30:20.718 --> 30:22.287
{\an8}happen without me?

30:22.353 --> 30:24.289
It's about time
that I stormed this runway

30:24.355 --> 30:26.591
and showed these hoes
how it's done.

30:26.658 --> 30:28.092
This is gonna be
a runway show

30:28.159 --> 30:30.428
that no one's
gonna forget.

30:41.506 --> 30:43.808
{\an8}The only person that means
something to me is you.

30:43.875 --> 30:45.143
{\an7}If you really
want to be with me,

30:45.210 --> 30:46.611
{\an7}don't say you want
to be with me

30:46.678 --> 30:48.813
{\an7}because you miss
what I do for you.

30:48.880 --> 30:50.848
{\an8}I didn't come here
at the end of the day

30:50.915 --> 30:53.218
to throw shade
at anybody.

30:53.284 --> 30:55.119
{\an8}Teairra,
that's very big of you,

30:55.186 --> 30:56.754

my fashion show

33:10.588 --> 33:13.191
{\an8}that I've been planning
for months.

33:13.257 --> 33:14.759
So, on the day of
the event,

33:14.826 --> 33:16.928
I had to let
that bitch know.

33:16.994 --> 33:18.062
It ain't over,

the reason we broke up

of trust.

{\an8}Hearing Princess say that
she just wants to be friends

I can't do that.

36:28.819 --> 36:32.390
But right here, right now,
I just can't.

Between all of
the drama that happened

36:33.958 --> 36:35.159
at the fashion show

36:35.226 --> 36:36.661
and the consistent
ups and downs

36:36.727 --> 36:38.229
of my relationship
with Ray,

36:38.296 --> 36:40.731
I need time to figure out
what's best for Princess.

36:40.798 --> 36:42.600
Maybe then, I'll be
ready to take Ray back,

36:42.667 --> 36:45.536
but, at this moment,
I really don't know.

36:48.940 --> 36:51.142
{\an1}Thank you
for my flowers.

36:56.847 --> 36:59.150
{\an8}You storm into
our fashion show,

36:59.216 --> 37:00.818
{\an8}brought your models,
and did all of that.

36:59.216 --> 37:00.818
{\an5}Yeah, I did.

37:00.885 --> 37:02.186
{\an8}That was
disrespectful.

37:02.253 --> 37:03.721
{\an7}Would you ever
expect me to invite

37:03.788 --> 37:06.290
{\an7}your arch nemesis
to a fitting?

37:06.357 --> 37:07.625
{\an8}Bitch, you be quiet--

37:06.357 --> 37:07.625
{\an8}I'm talking to you.

37:08.759 --> 37:10.361
{\an7}You've got
some (bleep) nerve.

37:10.428 --> 37:12.430
{\an7}Like, stop,
for real.

37:23.841 --> 37:25.409
Well, I think
the fashion show

37:25.476 --> 37:26.844
turned out to be
a success,

37:26.911 --> 37:31.349
and those backstabbing,
fake-ass fashionistas

37:31.415 --> 37:33.017
shouldn't have
doubted me.

37:33.084 --> 37:36.287
But Nikki invited me
to a come-to-Jesus meeting

37:36.354 --> 37:38.789
about stealing
the (bleep) show.

37:38.856 --> 37:40.424

37:40.491 --> 37:41.726

37:41.792 --> 37:44.095
I'm not afraid
of anything that her

37:44.161 --> 37:46.497
or her new little friends
have to say.

37:46.564 --> 37:48.165
But hopefully,
with Moniece with me,

37:48.232 --> 37:51.936
this won't turn into an
all-against-one situation.

37:52.003 --> 37:54.238
I haven't seen you since
the fashion show, girl.

37:54.305 --> 37:55.806
{\an1}I know,
the fashion show was crazy.

37:55.873 --> 37:57.541
{\an1}I'm not gonna lie, when you
showed up to the fashion show,

37:57.608 --> 37:59.744
like, you know, I'm never
gonna not conduct myself

37:59.810 --> 38:01.512
in a classy manner,
'cause this is my event

38:01.579 --> 38:03.247
that I worked
so hard for.

38:03.314 --> 38:04.715
So, you know,
I thought, as women,

38:04.782 --> 38:06.317
all of us can
all work together.

38:06.384 --> 38:08.419
I just felt
so doubted in the--

38:08.486 --> 38:09.687
well, at the fitting.

38:09.754 --> 38:11.155
{\an5}Right.

38:09.754 --> 38:11.155
So I just felt like,

38:11.222 --> 38:12.723
{\an1}let me just show them
that I am ready.

38:12.790 --> 38:15.326
{\an4}I work best
under pressure,
you know?

38:16.394 --> 38:18.429
{\an5}Well, hello.

38:16.394 --> 38:18.429
Hey, what's up?

38:18.496 --> 38:19.897
Hi, Teairra.

38:18.496 --> 38:19.897
Hi.

38:19.964 --> 38:21.599
{\an5}(Princess)
Now, I would love
to keep T.T.

38:21.666 --> 38:23.167
out of my life for good,

38:23.234 --> 38:25.069
but since we're gonna be
working the same circles

38:25.136 --> 38:26.804
and keep crossing paths,

38:26.871 --> 38:28.339
I think it's best
if we just find a way

38:28.406 --> 38:29.974
to put the bull (bleep)
behind us.

38:30.041 --> 38:32.443
But when I saw Moniece
sitting next to Teairra,

38:32.510 --> 38:34.645
all I could think is,
why is she here?

38:34.712 --> 38:36.047
If we were
bringing sidekicks,

38:36.113 --> 38:37.314
then I would have
brought mine.

38:37.381 --> 38:39.550
When you stormed
into our fashion show,

38:39.617 --> 38:40.751
{\an5}brought your models--

38:39.617 --> 38:40.751
Yeah, I did.

38:40.818 --> 38:42.553
And did all of that,
that was disrespectful.

38:42.620 --> 38:44.021
{\an5}It was a little
disrespectful.

38:42.620 --> 38:44.021
And that's fine.

38:44.088 --> 38:45.523
{\an1}And I'm telling you
my stance on it.

38:45.589 --> 38:47.058
{\an1}I'm not knocking your line,
I'm happy for you.

38:47.124 --> 38:48.726
{\an4}Thank you.

38:47.124 --> 38:48.726
You did a great job,
but I don't feel like

38:48.793 --> 38:50.594
{\an5}you should have
disrespected me
or anything.

38:50.661 --> 38:52.129
{\an1}Okay,
and I apologize for that.

38:52.196 --> 38:53.998
{\an1}You know, and I feel like,
you know, at the fashion show,

38:54.065 --> 38:55.866
when we spoke, I was like,
we'll talk about it later.

38:55.933 --> 38:57.568
{\an5}So now... I feel like
you can understand.

38:55.933 --> 38:57.568
{\an1}Yeah.

38:57.635 --> 38:59.170
{\an1}And that's--
and that's fine.

38:59.236 --> 39:00.638
And I want all of us,
if we gonna be around,

39:00.705 --> 39:02.039
we gotta be genuine--
we not about to be

39:02.106 --> 39:03.207
{\an5}doing all the
back and forth.

39:02.106 --> 39:03.207
{\an1}Yeah.

39:03.274 --> 39:04.475
Being successful,
you work with people

39:04.542 --> 39:05.910
you don't like,
and you go your own way.

39:05.976 --> 39:07.545
{\an4}Right.

39:05.976 --> 39:07.545
But at the end of
the day, do your job.

39:07.611 --> 39:09.947
{\an5}We not here,
any of us, to be petty--
we here to make money,

39:10.014 --> 39:11.048
we're not here to do
all that (bleep).

39:11.115 --> 39:12.416
We're all in
the same industry,

39:12.483 --> 39:13.784
like, we're all
trying to do fashion.

39:13.851 --> 39:15.352
You think we're not
gonna bump heads again?

39:15.419 --> 39:16.454
{\an5}You know what I mean?

39:15.419 --> 39:16.454
Of course.

39:16.520 --> 39:17.788
You think there's
not gonna be another

39:17.855 --> 39:19.557
{\an1}big event where we might
have to be in the same room?

39:19.623 --> 39:21.392
When my girl Teairra
asked me to come along

39:21.459 --> 39:22.660
as backup to this meeting,

39:22.727 --> 39:24.028
you know I had
to come through,

39:24.095 --> 39:25.996
but I'm not thrilled to be
sitting across the table

39:26.063 --> 39:28.065
from this (bleep) clown,
Princess.

39:28.132 --> 39:29.533
I mean, God,
somebody get her

39:29.600 --> 39:32.336
a (bleep) red nose
and a Bozo wig.

39:32.403 --> 39:35.272
As far as you and I go,
I'm just tired.

39:35.339 --> 39:37.842
{\an1}We will be fighting for life,
like, it's too much.

39:37.908 --> 39:39.477
{\an5}But it's not even, like...

39:37.908 --> 39:39.477
{\an1}Yeah, it's nothing
to fight about.

39:39.543 --> 39:41.946
{\an1}You made it a fight, like,
I tried to bury the hatchet.

39:42.012 --> 39:43.614
{\an5}Right, okay.

39:42.012 --> 39:43.614
You know what I mean?

39:43.681 --> 39:45.316
Question for you.

39:45.382 --> 39:47.118
Would you ever
expect me to invite

39:47.184 --> 39:49.787
your arch nemesis
to a fitting?

39:49.854 --> 39:51.422
{\an5}Bitch, you be quiet.

39:49.854 --> 39:51.422
I'm talking to you.

39:51.489 --> 39:53.924
{\an5}Ho.

39:51.489 --> 39:53.924
You don't like me,
I don't like you.

39:53.991 --> 39:55.960
{\an1}When you attacked
my friend...

39:56.026 --> 39:57.027
I don't give
a (bleep), bitch.

39:57.094 --> 39:58.462
{\an1}... would defend
any of your friends.

39:58.529 --> 39:59.663
I don't want to hear
nothing you have to say,

39:59.730 --> 40:01.198
because you're not
worth acknowledging.

40:01.265 --> 40:03.567
{\an1}You can let it go in
one ear and out the other.

40:03.634 --> 40:05.236
What is this about?
Seriously?

40:05.302 --> 40:06.570
{\an5}She threw a drink
on my friend.

40:05.302 --> 40:06.570
{\an1}Okay.

40:06.637 --> 40:07.772
{\an5}She needs to be more--

40:06.637 --> 40:07.772
Did you throw a drink

40:07.838 --> 40:09.039
{\an5}on me, Moniece?

40:07.838 --> 40:09.039
So that's my problem.

40:09.106 --> 40:10.708
{\an5}Moniece, Moniece--

40:09.106 --> 40:10.708
I'm not talking to you.

40:10.775 --> 40:12.710
{\an1}I'm talking to you--
did you throw a drink on me?

40:12.777 --> 40:13.944
{\an4}So--

40:12.777 --> 40:13.944
Did you throw
a drink on me?

40:14.011 --> 40:15.780
{\an1}Bitch, you've got
some (bleep) nerve,

40:15.846 --> 40:17.414
you stupid bitch.

40:17.481 --> 40:20.017
{\an5}(Nikki)
This meeting was supposed
to be a bunch of people

40:20.084 --> 40:21.719
that could sit down
like grown-ups

40:21.786 --> 40:23.621
so we could put to bed
whatever issues we had

40:23.687 --> 40:25.623
about the fashion show,
period.

40:25.689 --> 40:27.591
And Moniece is acting like
she shouldn't even be

40:27.658 --> 40:28.959
at the adult table.

40:29.026 --> 40:30.227
Ladies,
can you please?

40:30.294 --> 40:31.796
{\an1}Stop, for real.
Don't start.

40:31.862 --> 40:33.531
{\an6}Girl.

40:31.862 --> 40:33.531
{\an1}Don't start,
Princess.

40:33.597 --> 40:34.999
{\an6}Try me.
Try me.

40:33.597 --> 40:34.999
Do not start.

40:35.065 --> 40:36.834
{\an5}Do not start.

40:35.065 --> 40:36.834
I'll find the dumpster
you live in,

40:36.901 --> 40:39.170
{\an5}and I will beat
your ass, bitch.

40:36.901 --> 40:39.170
Do not start.

40:44.341 --> 40:46.143
{\an8}(voice)
Next time on
"Love &amp; Hip-Hop: Hollywood."

40:46.210 --> 40:48.279
{\an8}It's just a summer of Mom,
where you'll just be able

40:48.345 --> 40:50.014
{\an7}to check off
your bucket list.

40:50.080 --> 40:51.282
{\an8}Ring shopping,
sizing.

40:51.348 --> 40:52.550
{\an8}Okay.

40:52.616 --> 40:54.385
{\an8}I got this house
for you and me.

40:54.451 --> 40:56.387
{\an8}No, you didn't.

40:54.451 --> 40:56.387
{\an7}I swear,
I just got it.

40:56.453 --> 40:59.223
{\an7}Fizz, he's, like, you know,
Moniece has been really

40:59.290 --> 41:01.225
{\an8}emotional today
and admitted to me

41:01.292 --> 41:02.760
{\an8}she was still
in love with me.

41:04.395 --> 41:05.696
{\an8}It wasn't about me.

41:05.763 --> 41:07.531
{\an7}It wasn't about
moving forward with me,

41:07.598 --> 41:08.933
{\an7}it wasn't about
none of that, man.

41:07.598 --> 41:08.933
{\an5}Do you want to--

41:08.999 --> 41:11.368
{\an7}It wasn't about
none of that!

41:11.435 --> 41:13.404
{\an7}Tell that (bleep) to give you
the mother (bleep) ring.

41:14.505 --> 41:16.574
{\an7}You stuck your nose
in my business.

41:16.640 --> 41:18.409
{\an7}I don't give a (bleep)
about your (bleep) boyfriend.

41:18.475 --> 41:20.177
{\an8}Yeah, throw it!

41:20.244 --> 41:21.812
{\an8}Come here, bitch!

41:20.244 --> 41:21.812
{\an8}Right? Right?
