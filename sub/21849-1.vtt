Let me get two bindles.

00:40.843 --> 00:45.412
And don't fuck with me,
I want the homie price.

00:45.414 --> 00:46.513
You hear me?

00:48.317 --> 00:49.782

00:49.784 --> 00:52.785

00:52.787 --> 00:57.124

00:57.126 --> 00:59.227
Ah, I see.

00:59.229 --> 01:01.328
Look what you just did.

01:01.330 --> 01:03.597
Say nigger now.

01:03.599 --> 01:09.637
Awe, look. You got something
on your shoe, homie.

01:09.639 --> 01:11.372
Bitch.

01:15.279 --> 01:18.447
You good, baby?

02:10.402 --> 02:12.403
Hugo.

02:12.405 --> 02:13.771
Hey, buddy.

02:13.773 --> 02:15.340
How's the trap shot business?

02:15.342 --> 02:17.409
These guys are total suckers.

02:17.411 --> 02:19.945
Ya know, I'm still
waiting on my cut

02:19.947 --> 02:21.847
from that custom van work I did.

02:21.849 --> 02:23.748
It's rough out here,
I got overhead.

02:23.750 --> 02:26.284
You're such a shyster.

02:26.286 --> 02:27.188
Hey...

02:29.290 --> 02:31.824
You cool?

02:31.826 --> 02:35.362
Yeah, you?

02:35.364 --> 02:36.596
Yeah.

02:36.598 --> 02:39.899
Hugo, come on, man.

02:39.901 --> 02:42.736
You think you'll get
to ride in a lowrider?

02:42.738 --> 02:44.303
Maybe.

02:44.305 --> 02:46.339
That'd be cool.

02:46.341 --> 02:48.743
Yeah.

02:48.745 --> 02:52.012
Hey, get off my property!

05:03.086 --> 05:05.754
Ninja skills, try me, bitch.

05:05.756 --> 05:06.721
Give that back.

05:06.723 --> 05:08.891
Nope, it's mine now.

05:08.893 --> 05:11.026
What are you
gonna do with that?

05:11.028 --> 05:12.128
Keep it like a prize.

05:12.130 --> 05:13.162
Otto, can you help me?

05:13.164 --> 05:14.830
I almost got this, man.

05:14.832 --> 05:16.566
Is that a condom machine?

05:16.568 --> 05:18.068
That's disgusting.

05:18.070 --> 05:19.869
Seriously, dude, if you
don't shut the fuck up,

05:19.871 --> 05:21.537
I'm gonna rip your
fuckin' throat out.

05:21.539 --> 05:24.640
Hey, thought smack was
supposed to make you like,

05:24.642 --> 05:27.042
sleepy and nice,
not a douchetard.

05:27.044 --> 05:28.612
You have room to talk.

05:28.614 --> 05:29.814
You're like the
biggest asshole alive.

05:29.816 --> 05:30.982
Me?

05:30.984 --> 05:32.115
Yes, you!

05:32.117 --> 05:36.086
Fuck yes.

05:36.088 --> 05:37.487
Motivational speaker.

05:37.489 --> 05:38.922
I might kill you.

05:38.924 --> 05:40.425
Awe, then
you'd be so lonely.

05:40.427 --> 05:42.627
No, I wouldn't.

05:42.629 --> 05:44.662
What the fuck you
lookin' at, motherfucker?

05:44.664 --> 05:47.166
You want some of me, bitch?

05:47.168 --> 05:48.933
Alright, motherfucker.

05:48.935 --> 05:50.635
I should be a gang.

05:50.637 --> 05:52.104
Just you, huh?

05:52.106 --> 05:53.205
Mm-hmm.

05:53.207 --> 05:54.907
One person can't be a gang.

05:54.909 --> 05:56.707
Hey, no crushing
my dreams, okay?

05:56.709 --> 05:58.577
Okay, Fred, you're a gang.

05:58.579 --> 06:00.112
What would your name be?

06:00.114 --> 06:03.016
That's a good question.

06:03.018 --> 06:06.186
I don't know yet.

06:18.867 --> 06:19.935
Lobo.

06:24.105 --> 06:26.909
Look, Efe, I can explain.

06:28.076 --> 06:30.945
All you can do now is listen.

06:30.947 --> 06:33.047
We have no place
for you here, ese.

06:33.049 --> 06:36.217
Your coming here
disrupts my peace

06:36.219 --> 06:40.222
and I, Lobo,
I'm a peaceful man.

06:40.224 --> 06:42.056
Wait, wait, Poco Efe,
please, just wait.

06:42.058 --> 06:44.693
Begging ain't gonna
do you no good, homie.

06:44.695 --> 06:48.064
$50,000, just
$50,000 by tomorrow.

06:48.066 --> 06:50.098
Come on, Efe,
a little disruption

06:50.100 --> 06:53.134
and my protection is
worth at least $50,000.

06:53.136 --> 06:55.036
Trust me, I'm good for it, Efe.

06:55.038 --> 06:56.238
Shit'll be picked up
at my brother's place

06:56.240 --> 06:57.773
in Morieto tonight.

06:57.775 --> 06:59.111
Just needs to be trailed.

07:04.048 --> 07:05.818
I'll give you 24 hours
for your 50,000.

07:08.087 --> 07:09.721
And I'll take one of those.

07:11.089 --> 07:12.623
Come on, Efe.

07:12.625 --> 07:14.123
Do me a favor.

07:14.125 --> 07:16.693
You want a favor?

07:26.105 --> 07:28.006
You got 24 hours, ese.

07:54.936 --> 07:56.736
Thanks.

07:56.738 --> 07:58.104
My money, man, don't
be trippin', homie!

07:58.106 --> 07:59.104
Back the fuck up.

07:59.106 --> 08:00.340
What's going on, Z?

08:00.342 --> 08:02.641
Uh, there's like
a disagreement

08:02.643 --> 08:04.744
and a lot of racial slurs.

08:04.746 --> 08:07.080
The fuck is this?

08:07.082 --> 08:08.783
Nothing, gosh.

08:08.785 --> 08:11.052
So we should probably,
ya know, get outta here

08:11.054 --> 08:12.319
- 'cause this...
- Yo, you trippin', homie!

08:12.321 --> 08:14.154
Yo, you need to
back up off me.

08:14.156 --> 08:16.057
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
Freddie, Freddie.

08:16.059 --> 08:17.925
Say somethin'!

08:19.028 --> 08:20.795
I'm so over this shit.

08:20.797 --> 08:21.795
Going back to Vermont.

08:21.797 --> 08:22.997
Say somethin', homie!

08:22.999 --> 08:24.866
- Say somethin'!
- What?

08:24.868 --> 08:26.001
<i>Chuchu, please
they're gonna kill me</i>

08:26.003 --> 08:27.835
<i>and I need your help, baby.</i>

08:27.837 --> 08:28.970
<i>Babe!</i>

08:28.972 --> 08:30.171

08:30.173 --> 08:32.975
Lobo, I miss you.

08:32.977 --> 08:34.376
<i>Well, you're never
gonna fuckin' see me again</i>

08:34.378 --> 08:35.943
<i>if you don't fuckin' help me!</i>

08:35.945 --> 08:38.712
Why are you yelling?

08:38.715 --> 08:40.381
<i>'Cause he bit
my fuckin' finger off</i>

08:40.384 --> 08:41.818
<i>and he's gonna let
these niggas kill me</i>

08:41.820 --> 08:42.818
<i>if I don't get him this money.</i>

08:42.821 --> 08:43.818
Lobo.

08:43.821 --> 08:44.853
<i>Fuck, baby, what?</i>

08:44.855 --> 08:46.191
Nobody's gonna kill you.

08:47.359 --> 08:49.324
Nobody's gonna kill you.

08:49.326 --> 08:50.993
<i>Just fuckin' help me.</i>

08:50.995 --> 08:52.661
<i>Jose should already be there,
just make sure</i>

08:52.663 --> 08:54.063
<i>they stay with the
fuckin' problem.</i>

08:54.065 --> 08:55.699
Okay.

08:55.701 --> 08:57.100
Fucking fine, fuck.

08:57.102 --> 08:58.735
<i>I've only got 24 hours.</i>

09:00.338 --> 09:01.972

- Come on, kill me, puta!

09:01.974 --> 09:04.074
Kill me, kill me, come on, hey!

09:04.076 --> 09:05.309
Puto!

09:05.311 --> 09:06.977
Oh, almost!

09:09.381 --> 09:11.147
I'll shine your shit

09:11.149 --> 09:12.984
Give it to me.

09:12.986 --> 09:15.085
Oh, you bitch!

09:15.087 --> 09:16.421
Puto, fuck you!

09:16.423 --> 09:17.989
Fuck, shit.

09:22.395 --> 09:24.696
Anybody got better
shit than Paolo, huh?

09:24.698 --> 09:27.799
Now that is what you
call a loaded question

09:27.801 --> 09:29.402
'cause I,

09:29.404 --> 09:31.437
you wanna hear no, but then
that's a suspect answer

09:31.439 --> 09:36.107
because I know that
you wanna hear it.

09:40.982 --> 09:42.351
Sit down.
What are you doing?

09:44.987 --> 09:47.319
Alright, now can
I get the stuff?

09:47.321 --> 09:49.722
Yes.

09:49.724 --> 09:50.759
Yes, you can.

09:52.828 --> 09:54.163
Alright, I'll
wait for you here.

10:02.038 --> 10:05.142
- You're fucked up.
- You're fucked up.

10:08.378 --> 10:10.147
I like him.

10:12.215 --> 10:13.814
Okay, man, I'm done.

10:13.816 --> 10:15.282
I'm done with you
fuckin' bitches.

10:15.284 --> 10:16.484
You say that you like
my friend, Donny,

10:16.486 --> 10:17.786
well, it's your lucky day.

10:17.788 --> 10:20.022
Stand up, you fucking cunt.

10:20.024 --> 10:22.023
Hey, Donny, take her,

10:22.025 --> 10:23.459
Fuckin' shit.

10:23.461 --> 10:25.793
What the fuck are

10:25.795 --> 10:27.796
Fuck.

10:27.798 --> 10:30.132
Here ya go, I'll have the rest
for you tomorrow, alright?

10:30.134 --> 10:31.266
You're a good boy, Donny.

10:31.268 --> 10:33.103
Thanks.

10:33.105 --> 10:34.803
I hope nothing bad happens
to you between these times.

10:34.805 --> 10:36.406
You see, why you
gotta say it like that

10:36.408 --> 10:37.807
'cause now I think
you want something bad

10:37.809 --> 10:38.807
to happen to me.

10:38.809 --> 10:39.842
No, I don't.

10:39.844 --> 10:41.478
Yes, you do.

10:41.480 --> 10:42.912
No.

10:42.914 --> 10:43.946
No, I don't.

10:43.948 --> 10:45.248
Yes, you do, man.

10:45.250 --> 10:46.515
Way to fuckin' creep
me out, alright?

10:46.517 --> 10:48.018
I'm leavin'.

10:48.020 --> 10:49.019
Hey, hey, hey,
take Chuchu with you.

10:49.021 --> 10:50.755
It's my gift.

10:50.757 --> 10:52.322
No, no, no, no, she's
like fuckin' half dead.

10:52.324 --> 10:53.957
I don't want her, alright,
you keep her, please.

10:53.959 --> 10:55.960
Paolo does not take no
for an answer and, um,

10:55.962 --> 10:57.093
I don't want her anymore.

10:57.095 --> 10:59.864
So, no Chuchu, no loan.

10:59.866 --> 11:03.067
Ah, fuck.

11:03.069 --> 11:04.102
Alright, fuck, fine,
I'll take her.

11:04.104 --> 11:05.102
Come on.

11:05.104 --> 11:06.103
Hey, Donny!

11:06.105 --> 11:07.972
Yeah?

11:07.974 --> 11:09.841
- I like you.
- What the fuck does that mean?

11:09.843 --> 11:11.876
You like Venice too, look
how she fuckin' ended up.

11:12.945 --> 11:16.147
Correction, my friend.

11:16.149 --> 11:18.415
I love Venice.

11:18.417 --> 11:20.419
I only like you.

11:20.421 --> 11:22.255
Right, yeah, of course.

11:22.257 --> 11:24.457
Alright, come on, let's go.

11:24.459 --> 11:26.425
Let's go.

11:26.427 --> 11:28.096
Let's go, let's go, let's go.

11:30.365 --> 11:31.830
Hey.

11:31.832 --> 11:33.065
Taking his bag, alright?

11:33.067 --> 11:34.233
It's got the papers in it.

11:34.235 --> 11:36.003
Hey, I'll go with.

11:36.005 --> 11:38.004
Z, tell Otto I got
kidnapped by aliens.

11:38.006 --> 11:38.907
Okay.

11:48.516 --> 11:49.917
Hey.

11:49.919 --> 11:51.451
What?

11:51.453 --> 11:52.887
What were you gonna say?

11:52.889 --> 11:55.156
Uh, just that,

11:55.158 --> 11:57.591
I'm glad that you're
traveling with.

11:57.593 --> 12:00.530
Well, it was either
you or Air Force One, so.

12:50.549 --> 12:52.182
Hey.

12:52.184 --> 12:53.350
What's up?

12:53.352 --> 12:54.520
Come here for a minute.

13:04.164 --> 13:05.964
Ooh, you're like a
fuckin' terrorist.

13:05.966 --> 13:07.431
You're comin' with me.

13:07.433 --> 13:08.901
That's exactly what
a terrorist would say.

13:08.903 --> 13:10.502
We're going to Burger Bomb.

13:10.504 --> 13:12.471
Oh, why didn't you just
say that in the first place?

13:12.473 --> 13:13.374
Bye, Nick.

13:15.543 --> 13:17.346
You have work to do.

13:34.262 --> 13:36.963
Hey, Donny.

13:36.965 --> 13:38.198
Hey, Otto.

13:38.200 --> 13:39.500
She dead?

13:39.502 --> 13:41.367
- Her, no.
- She looks dead, dude.

13:41.369 --> 13:43.136
You can't say that
'cause she's not dead.

13:43.138 --> 13:45.006
- Oh, she's not dead?
- No.

13:45.008 --> 13:47.074
- Where'd you get her?
- She was a gift.

13:47.076 --> 13:49.044
- Oh, she was a gift, huh?
- Yeah.

13:49.046 --> 13:50.245
Think when she dies,
they're gonna, I don't know,

13:50.247 --> 13:51.713
give you a new one?

13:51.715 --> 13:53.147
Yeah, see, I don't
know why she said that

13:53.149 --> 13:54.616
'cause she's not gonna die.

13:54.618 --> 13:56.418
They got shit
goin' on by the stairs.

13:56.420 --> 13:58.185
Yeah? Otto, what's
going on back there?

13:58.187 --> 13:59.220
Yeah, Donny, she's
like grabbing onto her

13:59.222 --> 14:00.222
fuckin' head, dude.

14:00.224 --> 14:01.324
Let her go.

14:01.326 --> 14:02.325
Let her go.
Walk, dude.

14:02.327 --> 14:03.693
Let her go.

14:03.695 --> 14:05.094
Take her up,
man, get her inside.

14:05.096 --> 14:06.963
What the fuck?

14:06.965 --> 14:08.129
Sorry.

14:08.131 --> 14:09.165
It's cool, brother.

14:09.167 --> 14:10.134
See you around.

14:12.269 --> 14:14.070
Let's go.

14:14.072 --> 14:15.238
Yeah.

14:15.240 --> 14:17.407
Still think she's gonna die.

14:17.409 --> 14:18.977
She probably will.

14:20.179 --> 14:21.210
Hey.

14:21.212 --> 14:22.247
Yo.

14:24.082 --> 14:25.349
Nick, meet Chuchu.

14:25.351 --> 14:26.686
Chuchu, you say hello to Nick.

14:28.087 --> 14:30.553
Nice, real sweetheart.

14:30.555 --> 14:32.189
Now, Nick, you
gotta promise me.

14:32.191 --> 14:33.591
You gotta be careful
with this stuff

14:33.593 --> 14:35.025
because it's gonna
make your face drip off

14:35.027 --> 14:36.660
in like five minutes.

14:36.662 --> 14:38.596
Not that that's a bad
thing, by the way.

14:38.598 --> 14:40.530
That clean, huh?

14:40.532 --> 14:43.601
Yeah, the guy's a
fuckin' psycho, dude. You know?

14:43.603 --> 14:45.635
You know, he made me take her
if I wanted to buy his shit.

14:45.637 --> 14:48.506
Nick, the dude fuckin'
gave me a human being.

14:48.508 --> 14:51.409
Obviously I did because the
dude's fuckin' scary, ya know?

14:51.411 --> 14:55.047
So, Donny, I have a favor.

14:55.049 --> 14:56.615
I didn't come up
with all the money.

14:56.617 --> 14:59.251
Uh, shit.

14:59.253 --> 15:02.587
That kinda makes me a
little nervous because

15:02.589 --> 15:04.590
the dude was sketchin' out
about nothing bad happening,

15:04.592 --> 15:06.726
now you're telling me you
only got half his money, Nick.

15:06.728 --> 15:08.495
Say yes, Donny.
You know I'm good for it.

15:08.497 --> 15:10.130
If you're not cut
out for this shit,

15:10.132 --> 15:11.497
go get a job at a carwash.

15:11.499 --> 15:13.400
Will you just take a
minute and just listen

15:13.402 --> 15:15.468
to the words that are comin'
outta your mouth, please?

15:15.470 --> 15:18.637
Look, my guy is a
trust fund surfer.

15:18.639 --> 15:20.608
It'll be fine, just
meet me at the beach

15:20.610 --> 15:22.810
around 10 and I'll
have the rest of it.

15:22.812 --> 15:24.411
Yeah, right, meet at the
beach at 10 because

15:24.413 --> 15:25.746
nothing bad ever happens
at the beach, right?

15:25.748 --> 15:27.415
Donny!

15:27.417 --> 15:29.083
You know, we're up.

15:29.085 --> 15:31.084
I'm fine, right?

15:31.086 --> 15:33.086
I'm fine, fuck, I'll do it,

15:33.088 --> 15:35.158
but only fuckin'
because it's you.

15:56.247 --> 15:58.614
Come on, buddy, you
gotta eat something.

15:58.616 --> 16:02.250
Can't just survive off
of donuts and drugs.

16:02.252 --> 16:03.619
I drink.

16:03.621 --> 16:06.121
Z, Yoohoo is barely
considered a drink.

16:06.123 --> 16:07.323
You're crazy.

16:07.325 --> 16:09.726
Yoohoo is wizard milk.

16:09.728 --> 16:11.661
It's wizard milk.

16:11.663 --> 16:15.399
I'm getting you a burger
and you're gonna eat it, okay?

16:15.401 --> 16:17.568
Hey!

16:17.570 --> 16:19.539
You're gonna eat it
'cause I love you.

16:53.407 --> 16:55.142
I don't want you
to hook up with Nick.

16:55.144 --> 16:56.877
Ugh, what do you care?

16:56.879 --> 17:00.346
It's just a bad idea.
I care.

17:00.348 --> 17:05.185
I mean, he's cute and I'm
pretty sure he likes me.

17:05.186 --> 17:06.719
Guys like him never like me.

17:06.721 --> 17:08.588
They always like the

17:08.589 --> 17:11.691
douchey California counter
girls of the world.

17:11.693 --> 17:12.792
Not true.

17:12.795 --> 17:14.631
Nope, it's definitely true.

17:17.699 --> 17:19.499
What the fuck, Z?

17:19.501 --> 17:20.901
Excuse me, do
you have a warrant?

17:20.903 --> 17:22.803
Zandar Phillips
gave us permission

17:22.805 --> 17:24.938
to search the vehicle, miss.

17:24.940 --> 17:27.175
Zandar, where the
hell are you from?

17:27.178 --> 17:28.776
- He's from Connecticut.
- I know.

17:28.778 --> 17:31.482
Mommy and Daddy Phillips
are gonna be pissed.

17:37.555 --> 17:38.754
Whose is this?

17:38.756 --> 17:41.355
It's mine, actually.

17:41.357 --> 17:42.490
And why do you have it?

17:42.492 --> 17:43.793
It was a prize.

17:43.795 --> 17:45.331
- Prize?
- Mm-hmm.

17:47.298 --> 17:48.297
How old are you?

17:48.299 --> 17:49.699
18.

17:49.701 --> 17:51.433
- No, you're not.
- Yeah, I am.

17:51.435 --> 17:54.472
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

17:57.642 --> 17:58.908
I'm arresting you.

17:58.910 --> 18:01.745
Oh, couldn't resist, could ya?

18:03.215 --> 18:04.781
Freddie.

18:04.783 --> 18:06.450
I'll meet you at the
beach tomorrow, Otto.

18:06.452 --> 18:10.621
And Zandar of Connecticut,
when I get back,

18:10.623 --> 18:13.293
ice cream sundaes for days.

18:16.329 --> 18:17.862
Otto, what are we gonna do?

18:17.864 --> 18:19.396
Don't worry, we're gonna
be best friends in like

18:19.398 --> 18:20.432
two minutes.

18:20.434 --> 18:21.465
Shut up and get in.

18:21.467 --> 18:22.869
See? He likes me already.

18:25.606 --> 18:27.505
What are we gonna tell Nick?

18:27.507 --> 18:28.740
You don't tell him anything.

18:28.742 --> 18:30.645
I'll figure out what to say.

18:41.556 --> 18:42.887
Wait a minute, really?

18:42.889 --> 18:44.193
Really?

18:46.461 --> 18:47.594
Bitch just pops a bunch
of fuckin' pills.

18:47.596 --> 18:49.663
I gotta deal with the bullshit.

18:49.665 --> 18:53.466
- Where the fuck do you live?
- Where the fuck do you live?

18:53.468 --> 18:54.867
Where the fuck do I live?

18:54.869 --> 18:56.670
Yes, really.

18:56.672 --> 18:59.806
Well, you know what?
Fuck this.

18:59.808 --> 19:01.841
If I can't be asking
fuckin' questions,

19:01.843 --> 19:04.012
I see what's going on here.

19:16.592 --> 19:18.592
<i>This is
a collect call from...</i>

19:18.594 --> 19:19.594
<i>Freddie.</i>

19:19.596 --> 19:20.696
I accept.

19:20.698 --> 19:21.600
Freddie?

19:23.801 --> 19:24.800
Hey, Mom.

19:24.802 --> 19:26.534
You're three days late.

19:26.536 --> 19:30.505
Sorry, I thought weekly
was more of a range.

19:30.507 --> 19:31.674
<i>Where are you?</i>

19:31.676 --> 19:33.509
<i>California.</i>

19:33.511 --> 19:34.510
Where exactly?

19:34.512 --> 19:35.848
Um...

19:37.649 --> 19:39.948
I don't know.

19:39.950 --> 19:41.350
How's Hugo?

19:41.352 --> 19:42.518
Sleeping.
It's late.

19:42.520 --> 19:43.919
Shit, I'm sorry.

19:43.921 --> 19:45.621
I forgot the time difference.

19:45.623 --> 19:47.890
You know, Courtney had
her sweet 16 last weekend.

19:47.892 --> 19:49.958
Her mother called to see
if you wanted to come.

19:49.960 --> 19:51.861
I told her you were
with your father.

19:51.863 --> 19:54.532
Come on, you're lying.

19:54.534 --> 19:55.800
Courtney's mom would never call.

19:55.802 --> 19:57.034
She hates me.

19:57.036 --> 19:58.869
What the fuck is a sweet 16?

19:58.871 --> 20:01.738
<i>Is that like a fancy name
for a birthday party?</i>

20:01.740 --> 20:03.006
It's an important milestone.

20:03.008 --> 20:04.742
<i>Why?</i>

20:04.744 --> 20:09.715
Is 15 like a year we
celebrate the surviving of?

20:09.717 --> 20:11.917
- Freddie.
- Mother.

20:11.919 --> 20:14.652
<i>Could you just please
wake up Hugo, please?</i>

20:14.654 --> 20:15.954
No.

20:15.956 --> 20:17.988
You want your family,
you come home.

20:17.990 --> 20:19.891
<i>Gosh, for the
millionth time, I told you,</i>

20:19.893 --> 20:21.093
<i>I'm not coming home.</i>

20:21.095 --> 20:23.095
Why are you doing this to me?

20:23.097 --> 20:25.530
Jesus Christ, Freddie, I'm
really worried about you.

20:25.532 --> 20:26.769
<i>I miss you.</i>

20:30.137 --> 20:32.939
Stop worrying, okay?

20:32.941 --> 20:33.976
I'm fine.

20:35.910 --> 20:37.913
<i>Will you just tell
Hugo that I miss him?</i>

20:39.147 --> 20:40.948
I gotta go.

20:40.950 --> 20:41.851
Bye.

20:44.653 --> 20:45.555
Freddie.

20:46.856 --> 20:47.856
Freddie?

21:04.007 --> 21:05.606
Stop.

21:05.608 --> 21:07.544
Okay, stop.

21:09.980 --> 21:11.881
Crying, okay.

21:11.883 --> 21:14.517
Ooh. Okay.

21:14.519 --> 21:16.588
Okay. Okay.

21:21.024 --> 21:23.024
You're lying. There's no way
that she's with Dave.

21:23.026 --> 21:24.760
That guy is a total scumbag.

21:24.762 --> 21:26.462
She didn't go
because of him, man.

21:26.464 --> 21:27.998
Dave's ridin' with Dready Jeff.

21:28.000 --> 21:29.569
You know what kinda
player that cat is.

21:31.503 --> 21:33.169
I still think
you're full of shit.

21:33.171 --> 21:35.774
She said she'd meet us at
the beach tomorrow, relax.

21:41.713 --> 21:44.182
What'd he do?

21:44.184 --> 21:48.218
He, um...

21:49.555 --> 21:50.823
Sorry, man.

21:52.492 --> 21:54.492
Whatever.

21:54.494 --> 21:55.896
Get Freddie's bag.

22:07.140 --> 22:08.807
Let's go, debutante.

22:08.809 --> 22:11.776
Ooh, where we going, a ball?

22:11.778 --> 22:13.180
I got your ball.

22:20.020 --> 22:21.653
This amuses you?

22:21.655 --> 22:23.957
No, but if you're
gonna make the effort.

22:23.959 --> 22:25.591
This is a mugshot.

22:25.593 --> 22:26.892
I know.

22:26.894 --> 22:28.160
But my mom always says-

22:28.162 --> 22:29.262
Nobody in here
gives a damn what your

22:29.264 --> 22:30.864
white ass mama says.

22:30.866 --> 22:32.499
Lost your doggone mind.

22:32.501 --> 22:33.436
Turn.

22:37.873 --> 22:40.274
Oh, yeah, who
let the wetbacks out?

22:40.276 --> 22:43.843
Hey!

22:43.845 --> 22:46.615
Step it back, would you?

22:51.087 --> 22:52.219
Oh, come on.

22:52.221 --> 22:54.655
Why am I alone?

22:54.657 --> 22:56.924
'Cause I know it
will annoy you more.

22:56.926 --> 22:58.593
Come on.

22:58.595 --> 23:00.262
What if you forget to feed me?

23:00.264 --> 23:01.830
It happens at the
zoo all the time.

23:01.832 --> 23:04.065
Oh, I wouldn't
worry about that.

23:04.067 --> 23:07.169
Besides, you could afford
to lose a few pounds.

23:07.171 --> 23:08.240
Damn.

23:10.040 --> 23:13.942
Hey, listen, I just,

23:13.944 --> 23:16.144
I was wondering,

23:16.146 --> 23:18.547
are you guys taking bets on
who's gonna win over there?

23:18.549 --> 23:21.585
Because I want in.

23:21.587 --> 23:23.720
My money's on the chicas.

23:23.722 --> 23:25.087
Why is that, cracker baby?

23:25.089 --> 23:27.190
I don't know,
they work harder,

23:27.192 --> 23:29.226
not always late.

23:29.228 --> 23:32.028
You know what happens
if I put you in that cell?

23:32.030 --> 23:35.799
Hmm, we toast marshmallows
and sing a multiracial

23:35.801 --> 23:37.201
version of Kumbaya?

23:37.203 --> 23:39.037
Child, you got your
little privileged ass

23:39.039 --> 23:41.573
arrested in the wrong county
at the wrong time.

23:41.575 --> 23:43.907
Right, there is a good place
to get arrested.

23:43.909 --> 23:44.975
I forgot.

23:44.977 --> 23:46.176
You don't even know, do you?

23:46.178 --> 23:48.179
Why don't you tell me?

23:48.181 --> 23:49.780
Ooh, it'll be like story time.

23:49.782 --> 23:51.953
Hmm, I'm gonna do
better than tell you.

23:53.220 --> 23:55.624
Oh, come on, don't leave now.

23:57.791 --> 23:58.693
Keep playin'.

24:58.922 --> 25:00.657
Hey.

25:00.659 --> 25:02.725
What are you doing?

25:02.727 --> 25:05.261
Just trying to realign
all the blood in my body

25:05.263 --> 25:06.995
so it floods to my brain

25:06.997 --> 25:08.097
so I'm not so bored.

25:08.099 --> 25:09.265
You?

25:09.267 --> 25:12.736
Releasing you, you're OR'd.

25:12.738 --> 25:14.170
What does that mean?

25:14.172 --> 25:16.006
Releasing you on
your own recognizance,

25:16.008 --> 25:18.042
but you have to come back for
your court date, of course.

25:18.044 --> 25:19.179
Of course, yeah.

25:20.412 --> 25:22.179
Why you smiling like that?

25:22.181 --> 25:23.947
Happy for you is all.

25:23.949 --> 25:26.182
Now get the hell outta here
before I change my mind.

25:26.184 --> 25:27.852
Yes, ma'am.

25:27.854 --> 25:28.886
You gotta take her back, man.

25:28.888 --> 25:31.022
No, I will not take a gift back.

25:31.024 --> 25:32.891
- Bad luck.
- Look, I'll leave her here.

25:32.893 --> 25:34.159
It'll be like I
never had her, right?

25:34.161 --> 25:35.727
How bout this,
I can help wake her up

25:35.729 --> 25:36.995
and then
you can discuss it with her.

25:36.997 --> 25:38.328
Okay?

25:38.330 --> 25:41.399
Venice, bring
something for Chuchu.

25:41.401 --> 25:43.102
It's all here?

25:43.104 --> 25:44.335
Where the fuck did she
even come from anyway?

25:44.337 --> 25:45.970
She was my brother's girl,

25:45.972 --> 25:47.306
but you don't have
to worry about that.

25:47.308 --> 25:48.406
The fucker is in the
pen for shooting

25:48.408 --> 25:49.741
some nigger's head off.

25:49.743 --> 25:51.743
Oh, my God.

25:51.745 --> 25:53.778
Oh, my God, you fuckin'
psycho voodoo bastard.

25:53.780 --> 25:55.314
You're tryin' to
fuckin' kill me!

25:55.316 --> 25:56.816
It's like you fuckin'
sit there in your chair

25:56.818 --> 25:58.116
with your fuckin' cowboy hat on.

25:58.118 --> 25:59.752
You look me in the
eyes and you say,

25:59.754 --> 26:01.153
"I like you, Donny,"
'cause I remember it,

26:01.155 --> 26:02.788
and then you send me
with a lifeless chick

26:02.790 --> 26:04.423
and she's a fuckin'
fruit basket.

26:04.425 --> 26:06.026
Donny.

26:06.028 --> 26:08.729
- Shut the fuck up.
- You shut up.

26:08.731 --> 26:10.163
Why don't you both
shut the fuck up?

26:10.165 --> 26:12.132
Relax, my brother's the
least of your worries.

26:12.134 --> 26:14.034
He's as good as dead.

26:14.036 --> 26:16.002
Least of my concerns?
Would you listen to yourself?

26:16.004 --> 26:17.939
You're talkin' about your
own fuckin' brother here.

26:17.941 --> 26:20.040
No, no, no, no, absolutely not.

26:20.042 --> 26:21.142
No fuckin' way.

26:21.144 --> 26:22.777
My brother was a no good thug.

26:22.779 --> 26:24.311
We reap what we sow.

26:24.313 --> 26:25.413
The fuck does that mean?

26:25.415 --> 26:26.414
Now like I deserve this?

26:26.416 --> 26:27.414
What did I do?

26:27.416 --> 26:28.415
Donny, come here.

26:28.417 --> 26:29.850
No, no, no, no, no, no.

26:29.852 --> 26:32.120
No, don't start this shit again.

26:32.122 --> 26:33.821
Maybe this is a good thing.

26:33.823 --> 26:36.157
When's the last time
you got laid?

26:36.159 --> 26:37.192
Are you fuckin' serious?

26:37.194 --> 26:38.793
Yes.

26:38.795 --> 26:40.128
Paolo, you gotta
help me, alright?

26:40.130 --> 26:41.363
Oh, I did, she can walk now.

26:41.365 --> 26:42.333
Come on, Venice, please?

26:45.903 --> 26:47.470
Oh, fuck.

26:47.472 --> 26:49.275
Why the fuck is this
happening to me?

26:50.408 --> 26:51.474
Oh.

26:51.476 --> 26:54.042
Have fun, eh?

26:54.044 --> 26:54.947
Be gentle.

27:00.051 --> 27:01.384
Hey.

27:01.386 --> 27:02.786
Where's the white girl?

27:02.788 --> 27:04.388
I let her out.

27:04.390 --> 27:06.456
Neesy, she's 15
fuckin' years old.

27:06.458 --> 27:07.824
What did you think you
were gonna do with her?

27:07.826 --> 27:08.958
Send her home?

27:08.960 --> 27:09.994
It's 11:00 at night.

27:09.996 --> 27:11.361
That kid needed a lesson.

27:11.363 --> 27:13.863
Maybe but she
don't deserve to die.

27:13.865 --> 27:15.134
That's not my problem.

27:17.335 --> 27:18.839
You were at lunch.

27:39.527 --> 27:41.526
Hey, girl.

27:41.528 --> 27:43.295
What you doin' out
past your bedtime?

27:43.297 --> 27:44.330
Me?

27:44.332 --> 27:46.966
Yeah, you, baby.

27:46.968 --> 27:47.999
I lost my puppy.

27:48.001 --> 27:49.334
I'll be your puppy, baby.

27:49.336 --> 27:50.403
You guys got a cigarette?

27:50.405 --> 27:52.104
We got somethin' better.

27:52.106 --> 27:55.542
Girl, we got the gold.

27:55.544 --> 27:58.512
Crack is so pretty,
don't ya think?

27:58.514 --> 28:00.980
You know you want it, baby.

28:00.982 --> 28:03.917
No, I want a cigarette.

28:03.919 --> 28:05.919
What if I let you
have this one free?

28:05.921 --> 28:08.456
Then I'd say nothing
in life is free.

28:08.458 --> 28:09.990
But I don't know, maybe
we can make a deal.

28:09.992 --> 28:11.394
How much change you both
got in your pockets?

28:14.364 --> 28:15.833
Come on, playas, play with me.

28:18.167 --> 28:21.102
Okay, if I smoke your freebie,

28:21.104 --> 28:22.438
you give me all your change.

28:22.440 --> 28:24.075
- What do we get?
- Think about it.

28:25.106 --> 28:25.406
Why's the first one always free?

28:25.408 --> 28:26.408
It's the hook.

28:26.410 --> 28:28.911
Yep, so,

28:28.913 --> 28:31.145
if I smoke one hit and I
don't want another one,

28:31.147 --> 28:32.146
you pay me.

28:32.148 --> 28:33.315
Otherwise, I'm hooked.

28:33.317 --> 28:34.219
Alright, sugarplum.

28:37.888 --> 28:39.221
So, where you from, Ma?

28:39.223 --> 28:41.057
I'm a child star.

28:41.059 --> 28:43.359
My parents went crazy
and blew all my money.

28:43.361 --> 28:44.394
No way.

28:44.396 --> 28:45.528
Who are you?

28:45.530 --> 28:46.596
Bro, I'm just playing.

28:46.598 --> 28:48.530
I'm not a child star.

28:48.532 --> 28:49.836
Ready?

28:58.176 --> 29:00.411
Like it, baby?

29:00.413 --> 29:01.979
What the fuck did
we tell you about

29:01.981 --> 29:03.914
peddling your shit on
this side of town, huh?

29:03.916 --> 29:05.385
Hey yo, let go of
my brother, beaner!

29:06.551 --> 29:08.051
Fuck you call me?

29:08.053 --> 29:09.686
Shit, he just
called you a beaner!

29:09.688 --> 29:11.589
- Shut up, crack whore.
- Excuse me, sir.

29:11.591 --> 29:13.024
I am not a crack whore.

29:13.026 --> 29:14.126
Yeah, I just smoked
a hit of crack,

29:14.128 --> 29:15.127
but that doesn't...

29:15.129 --> 29:17.061
Bitch, shut the fuck up.

29:17.063 --> 29:18.996
Okay.

29:18.998 --> 29:20.432
That's fucking smart.

29:20.434 --> 29:21.966
Yeah, I'm leaving.

29:21.968 --> 29:23.534
Oh, fuck, oh, shit.

29:23.536 --> 29:25.203
What we got going on
over here, huh?

29:25.205 --> 29:26.705
Oh, shit!

29:26.707 --> 29:29.341
Look like it's our side
of the town now, son.

29:29.343 --> 29:32.044
I wanna shoot your
motherfuckin' ass right now,

29:32.046 --> 29:34.080
you fuckin' roach.

29:34.082 --> 29:35.514
I been itchin' to shoot me a
motherfuckin' cholo tonight.

29:35.516 --> 29:37.684
Yeah, look, bap, bap, bap!

29:40.722 --> 29:42.956
What are you doing?

29:42.958 --> 29:44.058
Get outta here.

29:44.060 --> 29:46.159
But, Antoine, this my spot.

29:46.161 --> 29:47.660
Okay, I'm stuttering
around here.

29:47.662 --> 29:49.964
I'm not gettin' my point across?

29:49.966 --> 29:52.433
Get the fuck outta here.

29:52.435 --> 29:54.334
You think this
is a fuckin' game?

29:54.336 --> 29:56.704
Get the fuck outta here.

29:56.706 --> 29:59.341
Back to this motherfuckin'
burrito eatin'

29:59.343 --> 30:00.675
motherfucker right here.

30:00.677 --> 30:02.179
Oh, so you nervous, huh?

30:07.016 --> 30:09.149
Oh, my God.
What was that?

30:09.151 --> 30:12.286
Takin' our territory
back from the Mexo.

30:13.724 --> 30:15.123
Is that wise?

30:15.125 --> 30:17.426
Hell yeah, it's our spot now.

30:17.428 --> 30:19.594
Wouldn't it just be more
reasonable to, ya know,

30:19.596 --> 30:21.697
pick a spot they don't want?

30:21.699 --> 30:23.599
Oh, yeah he, oh, that's
the bitch right there.

30:23.601 --> 30:25.167
No, no, no, that's the
bigger bitch right here.

30:25.169 --> 30:27.069
Put it right here.
Right here.

30:27.071 --> 30:28.371
My boy over there, Antoine,

30:28.373 --> 30:30.072
it was one of his
boys that got shot.

30:30.074 --> 30:31.741
Now we fixin' to kill
all them roaches.

30:31.743 --> 30:33.343
If I had my gun,
they would be shot.

30:33.345 --> 30:35.112
Two Mexicans shot right now,

30:35.114 --> 30:37.346
cholo on the ground
bleedin' right now.

30:37.348 --> 30:39.282
The biggest problem is,
nigga who shot 'em all's

30:39.284 --> 30:41.684
threatening the pen
and shit, cock out.

30:41.686 --> 30:43.687
But it'll be over soon.

30:43.689 --> 30:45.622
I heard that nigga just got
moved back to general pop.

30:45.624 --> 30:48.125
Nah, I heard he's
buying himself protection.

30:50.696 --> 30:52.596
I'm done.
Deal's a deal, man.

30:52.598 --> 30:54.132
Nah, nah, no way.

30:54.134 --> 30:55.400
Nobody likes a punk.

30:57.037 --> 30:58.635
Jesus.

30:58.637 --> 30:59.804
Fine.

31:02.107 --> 31:03.477
Come on.

31:04.611 --> 31:05.746
Thank you.

31:07.548 --> 31:09.781
Hey, white girl.

31:09.783 --> 31:11.650
You pretty cool.

31:11.652 --> 31:14.752
How 'bout I let you
come home and do me?

31:14.754 --> 31:16.488
Enticing,

31:16.490 --> 31:20.527
but I've got plans, sorry.

31:20.529 --> 31:22.228
Pshhh.

31:35.645 --> 31:37.811
Yeah, Donny, come on!

31:37.813 --> 31:40.847
Oh, you're such a good boy,
Donny. You're such a good boy.

31:45.788 --> 31:48.722
Oh, my God.

31:48.724 --> 31:51.259
No more.

31:51.261 --> 31:56.364
Holy fuck, holy shit.

31:56.366 --> 31:58.666
No, no, no.

31:58.668 --> 31:59.704
You gotta stop right now.

32:09.746 --> 32:11.280
Good boy.

32:18.156 --> 32:19.888
Alright, see ya.

32:19.890 --> 32:22.525
So, guy is sick

32:22.527 --> 32:24.628

32:24.630 --> 32:26.330
Shit, alright.

32:26.332 --> 32:27.397
I'm gonna go see if
Freddie's here yet.

32:27.399 --> 32:28.831
She's not gonna be.

32:28.833 --> 32:30.333
They mentioned
stopping in Venice.

32:30.335 --> 32:31.802
You should just
fuckin' chill, man.

32:31.804 --> 32:33.504
That's alright, I'm
a little amped anyways.

32:33.506 --> 32:34.905
That shit gets into your system

32:34.907 --> 32:36.540
no matter how careful you are.

32:36.542 --> 32:38.709
Ooh, can I get some of
that shit in my system?

32:38.711 --> 32:40.644
- Yes, you may, baby.
- Ooh.

32:40.646 --> 32:41.778
Hey, hey.

32:41.780 --> 32:43.747
Don't eat it all, okay?

32:43.749 --> 32:45.219
Okay, alright.

32:57.331 --> 32:58.730
Pack of cigarettes, please.

32:58.732 --> 32:59.864
$1.65.

32:59.866 --> 33:02.433
How's 1.55 sound?

33:02.435 --> 33:04.870
Like you're short 10 cents.

33:04.872 --> 33:06.372
But it's only 10 cents.

33:06.374 --> 33:08.173
- Don't care.
- Come on, man.

33:08.175 --> 33:09.574
Want me to recite
state capitals?

33:09.576 --> 33:11.311
I want you to
have 10 more cents.

33:11.313 --> 33:14.780
Okay look, kind
gas attendant man.

33:14.782 --> 33:16.815
I have had a very long day.

33:16.817 --> 33:19.186
I was locked up for four hours

33:19.188 --> 33:21.654
in a racial wrestling ring
and I was just

33:21.656 --> 33:25.357
forced to smoke crack
in order to obtain

33:25.359 --> 33:29.497
this perfect amount of
change that you are calling

33:29.499 --> 33:31.231
10 cents short.

33:31.233 --> 33:32.533
'Cause it is.

33:32.535 --> 33:33.901
Oh, my God.

33:33.903 --> 33:35.635
This is what
we're gonna do, okay?

33:35.637 --> 33:37.441
I'm go...

33:38.875 --> 33:40.508
Thanks, man.

33:40.510 --> 33:42.446
- Have a great day.
- Mm-hmm.

33:47.617 --> 33:50.618
Hey, you guys have a light?

33:50.620 --> 33:52.489
No smoking.

33:54.925 --> 33:55.891
Come on, please.

33:55.893 --> 33:57.726
No, child, no smoking.

33:57.728 --> 33:59.695
You ain't gon' blow us up
out here tonight, uh-uh.

33:59.697 --> 34:00.863
Fine.

34:00.865 --> 34:01.998
Do you know how long it'd take

34:02.000 --> 34:03.532
to walk to San Diego from here?

34:03.534 --> 34:05.568
Child, I'm from LA.

34:05.570 --> 34:08.303
I ain't walked nowhere
since I was 10 years old.

34:08.304 --> 34:09.906
Shit, I gotta get there.

34:09.908 --> 34:10.906
Suggestions?

34:10.908 --> 34:12.908
Girl, use them thumbs.

34:12.909 --> 34:14.578
Or that pretty little mouth.

34:14.580 --> 34:17.915
Suck a dick
all the way to Mexico.

34:19.518 --> 34:21.485
Do you guys have pimps

34:21.487 --> 34:23.387
or a pimp?

34:23.389 --> 34:25.655
Why you ask?

34:25.657 --> 34:26.893
Bored fascination.

34:28.594 --> 34:30.629
I'll tell ya for two smokes.

34:30.630 --> 34:31.866
- Really?
- Uh-huh.

34:33.632 --> 34:34.534
Okay.

34:39.672 --> 34:41.039
He dead.

34:41.041 --> 34:43.373
Mm-hmm, I killed
that motherfucker.

34:43.376 --> 34:45.275
You're lyin', really?

34:47.681 --> 34:49.781
You's a dumbass white girl.

34:49.783 --> 34:52.551
She just being mean.
It's true though.

34:52.553 --> 34:55.487
I killed him. He was interfering
with my money makin'.

34:55.489 --> 34:58.523
That seems kinda
counterintuitive for a pimp.

34:58.525 --> 35:00.025
Yeah, he was hatin'
on our cholo niggas,

35:00.027 --> 35:01.594
so he had to go.

35:01.596 --> 35:03.497
Now let me give you
a tip, little girl.

35:03.499 --> 35:06.066
Ain't nobody out here this late

35:06.068 --> 35:10.970
except for murderers,
hustlers, hookers,

35:10.972 --> 35:12.706
and you.

35:12.708 --> 35:14.307
So watch your back.

35:14.309 --> 35:15.508
That's a pretty weak tip.

35:15.510 --> 35:16.709
Yeah, well, here's one.

35:16.711 --> 35:19.580
Start learning how to suck dick.

35:19.582 --> 35:22.716
You'll be fine.
Just stay away from them gangs.

35:22.718 --> 35:25.453
'Cause spics be
killin' niggas.

35:25.455 --> 35:26.920
Niggas be killin' spics.

35:26.922 --> 35:29.357
And as long as you
ain't one of them,

35:29.359 --> 35:30.491
you be alright.

35:30.493 --> 35:31.893
What about you guys?

35:31.895 --> 35:33.795
Ain't nobody kills
good pussy, honey.

35:33.797 --> 35:37.900
Yeah, baby.
Nobody kills good pussy, baby.

35:41.505 --> 35:43.472
Here, take it.

35:43.474 --> 35:45.541
There, did my good deed
for the day.

35:45.543 --> 35:47.342
Bye, ladies.

36:23.984 --> 36:28.520
Motherfucker!
Motherfucker!

36:31.124 --> 36:32.557
Niggers!

36:36.729 --> 36:38.697
Fucking cunt.

36:38.699 --> 36:42.735
Chuchu. Fuckin' kill her.

36:42.737 --> 36:44.436
Motherfucker, you!

36:45.507 --> 36:47.672
This is all her fault, Venice!

36:47.674 --> 36:49.641
No, Paolo, it's Lobo's fault.
It's your brother's fault.

36:49.643 --> 36:51.043
Yeah, exactly, why
isn't he dead yet?

36:51.045 --> 36:52.911
How should I know?

36:52.913 --> 36:54.981
You fuckin' bitch, I'm
gonna fuckin' shoot you.

36:57.052 --> 36:58.885
Fuck, shit.

36:58.887 --> 37:00.653
Alright, I'm gonna take off.

37:00.655 --> 37:02.555
If you wanna go, you
gotta take Chuchu with you.

37:02.557 --> 37:04.658
No, no, no, no.
I really don't think I can.

37:04.660 --> 37:06.526
You don't wanna take her,
no problem. I'll kill her.

37:06.528 --> 37:10.130
Alright, alright,
I'll take her, alright?

37:10.132 --> 37:12.199
You know, when I'm done
with all this shit,

37:12.201 --> 37:14.034
I'm gonna get a job
at a fuckin' carwash.

37:14.036 --> 37:15.770
Nine to five, that's
what I'm gonna do.

37:15.772 --> 37:18.940
No, you take Chuchu, you
get the rest of the money,

37:18.942 --> 37:20.442
you don't get robbed,
you don't get kidnapped,

37:20.444 --> 37:21.643
you don't get killed

37:21.645 --> 37:23.210
and this'll all be over soon.

37:23.212 --> 37:24.645
Alright, and I definitely
have to take her?

37:24.647 --> 37:25.847
Yes!

37:25.849 --> 37:28.850
Oh, fuck, fuck,
fuck, fuck, fuck.

37:43.835 --> 37:45.772
You gonna ask me
if I want ice cream?

37:50.209 --> 37:53.476
Why are you giving me money?

37:53.478 --> 37:56.582
I like to take care of
the kids on the street.

38:03.889 --> 38:05.558
You have a nice one, mister.

38:36.791 --> 38:38.525
- Hey, guys.
- Hey!

38:38.527 --> 38:39.992
So you didn't get shot,

38:39.994 --> 38:42.195
that's really great
for, ya know, you.

38:42.197 --> 38:44.597
But I assume not for the
other guys, you know?

38:44.599 --> 38:45.832
Oh, let me see, let me see.

38:45.834 --> 38:47.133
Oh, it's okay.

38:49.939 --> 38:52.872
That's 100% white girl
right there.

38:52.874 --> 38:54.308
Yeah.

38:54.310 --> 38:55.743
On point.

38:55.745 --> 39:01.115
Ooh. Ooh. Ooh.

39:01.117 --> 39:02.284
Helen Keller.

39:02.286 --> 39:04.219
Helen Keller, right?

39:04.221 --> 39:06.253
Yes, perfect, you are perfect.

39:06.255 --> 39:10.125
No, I'm pretty sure I
can see, hear and talk.

39:10.127 --> 39:11.126
No, no, no, no,
no, I get that.

39:11.128 --> 39:12.594
I get that, see,

39:12.596 --> 39:14.963
we got a game that
we like to play.

39:14.965 --> 39:16.130
Right?

39:16.132 --> 39:18.267
See, I'm gonna fuck you

39:18.269 --> 39:19.602
until you go blind.

39:19.604 --> 39:21.169
Then my man Beef here,

39:21.171 --> 39:24.140
he gonna fuck you
until you go deaf.

39:24.142 --> 39:26.575
Then I'm gonna come back around

39:26.577 --> 39:29.578
and I'm gonna fuck you
until you go mute.

39:29.580 --> 39:30.282
You see?

39:32.617 --> 39:33.817
Okay.

39:33.819 --> 39:35.686
That's seriously mortifying.

39:35.688 --> 39:37.788
Super clever though,
that's real clever.

39:37.790 --> 39:40.757
See we got a little
mouthy little smartass,

39:40.759 --> 39:42.893
little...
oh, shit!

39:42.895 --> 39:44.628
Yeah, I like her mouth.
I like her mouth.

39:44.630 --> 39:46.063
No, guys, that
was a compliment.

39:46.065 --> 39:47.931
Total compliment.

39:47.933 --> 39:50.167
Isn't there a war
you should be tending to?

39:50.169 --> 39:51.602
Bitch, don't be
talkin' to me about

39:51.604 --> 39:53.004
what I should be doin'!

39:53.006 --> 39:55.106
I should be fuckin'
you right now.

39:55.108 --> 39:57.841
Truce, man?
You want my cigarettes?

39:57.843 --> 39:59.676
No, I don't want no
fuckin' cigarettes.

39:59.678 --> 40:02.747
Oh, ain't nobody
to save your ass.

40:02.749 --> 40:04.015
Man, who the fuck?

40:04.017 --> 40:06.018
Dad, oh, my God, it's my Dad!

40:06.020 --> 40:07.819
Dad, oh, hey.

40:07.821 --> 40:09.321
Shit, one second.

40:09.323 --> 40:11.889
You know, guys, this
has been real great.

40:11.891 --> 40:14.659
Ya know, he's a cop,
I was just rebelling.

40:14.661 --> 40:15.860
You've seen it a million times.

40:15.862 --> 40:17.062
Hey, you know what though?

40:17.064 --> 40:18.864
You guys have a
really sick ride.

40:18.866 --> 40:21.100
Next time we hang out, I
wanna ride in it, you know?

40:21.102 --> 40:22.668
I got something
for you to ride on!

40:22.670 --> 40:24.137
Bye guys!

40:24.139 --> 40:27.108
Helen! Helen!

40:28.376 --> 40:30.175
Ooh.

40:30.177 --> 40:32.746
So, where you going?

40:32.748 --> 40:34.914
San Diego.

40:34.916 --> 40:36.715
That ain't her
daddy, nigga, that's a trick.

40:36.717 --> 40:38.219
She 'bout to suck
his dick right now.

40:38.221 --> 40:39.219
Come on, man.

40:39.221 --> 40:41.221
That was my white girl, man.

40:41.223 --> 40:42.390
Are you okay?

40:42.392 --> 40:43.826
Yeah, I'm fine.

40:46.928 --> 40:49.696
Just don't think you're gonna
get anything from me, okay?

40:49.698 --> 40:51.732
I don't.

40:51.734 --> 40:54.869
Well, excuse me if
I find that unlikely.

40:54.871 --> 40:57.072
I mean, I don't fault
you for it, it's just,

40:57.074 --> 41:00.311
you're not gonna get it
from me, deal?

41:04.248 --> 41:05.983
I hate clowns.

41:07.351 --> 41:09.117
What?

41:09.119 --> 41:12.855
They don't scare me,
I just don't like them.

41:12.857 --> 41:15.357
I set one on fire at my
friend's birthday party once.

41:15.359 --> 41:16.961
Why would you do that?

41:18.962 --> 41:21.930
Are you a serial killer?

41:21.932 --> 41:24.901
No, I'm a father.

41:24.903 --> 41:27.971
And John Wayne Gacy
was a fucking clown.

41:27.973 --> 41:32.208
That doesn't mean he
didn't kill little boys.

41:32.210 --> 41:35.244
I'm not a killer.

41:35.246 --> 41:37.380
Just listen, if
you are a murderer,

41:37.382 --> 41:39.483
that's your business entirely.

41:39.485 --> 41:42.086
Just please don't
murder me, okay?

41:42.088 --> 41:46.091
I'm way too fuckin' tired
to die right now.

41:46.093 --> 41:47.261
I promise.

43:13.285 --> 43:15.350
Uh...

43:15.352 --> 43:18.290
This is far as I can take you.

43:20.193 --> 43:22.525
Thanks for not killing me.

43:22.527 --> 43:24.230
Um, uh...

43:48.321 --> 43:49.491
Z?

43:51.391 --> 43:52.958
Dude.

43:52.960 --> 43:54.163
I can see you.

44:03.237 --> 44:04.637
I'm a Cherokee!

44:04.639 --> 44:06.309
Fuck! Go around!

44:21.222 --> 44:22.523
Chill the fuck out, Z.

44:22.525 --> 44:25.092
Dude, I need you to cool off.

44:28.898 --> 44:31.965
Z, Z, it's Nick, okay?

44:31.967 --> 44:35.068
Please, please shut the fuck up.

44:35.070 --> 44:36.404
You can't have me, man.

44:36.406 --> 44:38.240
You can't have me.

44:38.242 --> 44:39.408
I'm like free.

44:39.410 --> 44:41.109
I'm like a free man.

44:41.111 --> 44:42.144
We don't want you.

44:42.146 --> 44:44.280
We need you to shut the fuck up.

45:22.220 --> 45:23.356
Hey, that's pretty good.

45:26.326 --> 45:28.060
Hey, Herman, look at this.

45:28.062 --> 45:29.264
What?

45:39.073 --> 45:41.038
Cute.

45:41.040 --> 45:42.541
That
means he likes it.

45:42.543 --> 45:44.644
Right.

45:44.646 --> 45:46.112
And who are you?

45:46.114 --> 45:47.113
The ghost of Christmas past?

45:50.485 --> 45:52.718
Herman.
I'm just a drunk.

45:52.720 --> 45:55.990
He's not just a drunk.
Tell her.

45:57.325 --> 46:00.160
I write a little, that's all.

46:00.162 --> 46:01.196
Really?

46:03.332 --> 46:05.399
I'm Freddie, nice to meet you.

46:05.401 --> 46:07.667
I'm a runaway

46:07.669 --> 46:10.673
and according to two
gang members, a smartass.

46:12.774 --> 46:15.242
Runaway, huh?

46:15.244 --> 46:17.211
Someone beat you?

46:17.213 --> 46:19.780
No.

46:19.782 --> 46:21.583
Touch you?

46:21.585 --> 46:23.351
Nope.

46:23.353 --> 46:25.019
Orphan?

46:25.021 --> 46:26.023
No, sir.

46:28.657 --> 46:31.694
One who runs away often does so

46:31.696 --> 46:33.428
to get away from something.

46:33.430 --> 46:35.598
Yes, often.

46:35.600 --> 46:37.732
But not always.

46:41.071 --> 46:42.738
Do you know what
impetuous means?

46:42.740 --> 46:44.673
No.

46:44.675 --> 46:47.744
It means a person
who acts in a rash

46:47.746 --> 46:50.079
and inconsiderate manner,

46:50.081 --> 46:52.481
often the mark of
the very young.

46:52.483 --> 46:55.085
I think you just insulted me

46:55.087 --> 46:59.155
with a thesaurus.

46:59.157 --> 47:03.193
Well, as much as I
love to be analyzed.

47:03.195 --> 47:04.097
Please.

47:06.166 --> 47:07.234
Please stay.

47:09.135 --> 47:12.669
Keep an old man company while he

47:12.671 --> 47:16.106
eats one of his last meals.

47:16.108 --> 47:17.608
Fine.

47:17.610 --> 47:18.744
But it's your turn now.

47:18.746 --> 47:20.645
What?

47:20.647 --> 47:22.714
What's your mark

47:22.716 --> 47:27.453
of the, ya know,
very, very, very old?

47:27.455 --> 47:29.556
And make it good or
this dance is over.

47:33.227 --> 47:37.830
The mark of the very old is
always the same, young lady.

47:39.501 --> 47:44.540
Reflection hampered by
immeasurable regret.

47:47.441 --> 47:49.077
What's your biggest regret?

47:57.652 --> 48:00.386
That it took me
until now to realize

48:00.388 --> 48:03.257
what I could've
learned at your age

48:03.259 --> 48:06.794
if I wasn't such an impetuous,
horrid little know-it-all.

48:06.796 --> 48:10.499
Wow, you

48:10.501 --> 48:14.436
just might be the worst
new friend maker on the planet.

48:14.438 --> 48:17.275
Don't confuse
tactics with character.

48:33.625 --> 48:35.625
There's only

48:35.627 --> 48:38.162
one thing for people like us.

48:38.164 --> 48:41.164
If you say it's sweet 16's,
we're done for.

48:41.166 --> 48:43.800
Ambition.

48:43.802 --> 48:48.304
But once you know, you
have to live up to it

48:48.306 --> 48:50.240
or else.

48:50.242 --> 48:52.775
Or else?

48:52.777 --> 48:55.415
Liver spots and
immeasurable regret?

48:58.185 --> 49:00.754
Why run when there's
nothing to run from?

49:03.290 --> 49:04.756
I'm not running.

49:04.758 --> 49:07.660
Those were your
words, not mine.

49:10.264 --> 49:11.700
It's just an expression.

49:13.967 --> 49:15.469
Sure it is.

49:25.646 --> 49:28.948
It was nice to
meet you, Herman.

49:28.950 --> 49:30.318
Keep it.

51:02.083 --> 51:03.684
What's up, two socks?

51:07.454 --> 51:08.954
Hey.

51:08.956 --> 51:10.690
Said you were gonna
stop using rigs.

51:10.692 --> 51:11.827
It's better this way.

51:15.496 --> 51:18.397
Whatever, man, see ya outside.

51:18.399 --> 51:21.734
What the fuck man, what? What?

51:21.736 --> 51:23.837
I think we're being followed.

51:23.839 --> 51:25.571
What am I looking at?

51:25.573 --> 51:27.473
Look, those two Mexican dudes
down there in that car.

51:27.475 --> 51:29.942
What the fuck are you...
stop being paranoid, man.

51:29.944 --> 51:32.412
No, look, it rings a bell.

51:32.414 --> 51:34.349
What?

51:34.351 --> 51:36.751
Z, you're being paranoid,
chill the fuck out.

51:36.753 --> 51:39.454
Dude, it's just a blue car.

51:39.456 --> 51:42.023
No, the two Mexican dudes
sat in it all night.

51:42.025 --> 51:43.858
I am paranoid, but I'm
not wrong about this.

51:43.860 --> 51:46.394
Look, I remember them.

51:47.429 --> 51:48.829
Oh, motherfucker!

51:48.831 --> 51:51.432
Shit. Z, help me, man.

51:51.434 --> 51:54.535
What'd I just fucking
say about the needles?

51:54.537 --> 51:55.803
Yeah, Freddie
wouldn't be in jail

51:55.805 --> 51:57.473
if you weren't shooting!

51:59.709 --> 52:02.578
- What? Z?
- Oops.

52:02.580 --> 52:04.580
Freddie got popped from that
rig she snatched from Otto.

52:04.582 --> 52:05.815
You fucking dick.

52:05.817 --> 52:06.882
What happened?

52:06.884 --> 52:08.550
You OD'd, asshole.

52:08.552 --> 52:10.420
Go get ice.

52:48.962 --> 52:50.127
- Whoa.
- Sorry!

52:50.129 --> 52:51.797
Yeah, no.

52:51.799 --> 52:53.666
Hey, I know you.

52:53.668 --> 52:56.035
Uh, no, I don't think so.

52:56.037 --> 52:57.769
No, no, no, I
definitely know you.

52:57.771 --> 53:00.573
You're friends with
Dready Jeff, right?

53:00.575 --> 53:01.707
Yeah, kinda.

53:01.709 --> 53:04.477
Yeah, what are you doin' here?

53:04.479 --> 53:06.878
Um, I'm headed to San Diego.

53:06.880 --> 53:08.448
I got arrested yesterday

53:08.450 --> 53:11.685
and I managed to make it
this far without dying.

53:11.687 --> 53:14.587
Oh, shit.
You wanna sit down?

53:14.589 --> 53:16.457
You wanna have a cup
of coffee or something?

53:16.459 --> 53:18.558
- Yeah, thank you.
- Excuse me, ma'am.

53:18.560 --> 53:20.861
Can you get my friend
a cup of coffee please?

53:20.863 --> 53:21.895
Do you want anything else?

53:21.897 --> 53:22.895
You want something to eat?

53:22.897 --> 53:24.464
Food or something?

53:24.466 --> 53:27.001
Yeah, can I get a
cheese Danish please?

53:27.003 --> 53:28.635
And a jelly donut

53:28.637 --> 53:31.708
and no, that's it.

53:33.610 --> 53:34.642
Do you mind?

53:34.644 --> 53:36.910
Oh no, go ahead.

53:36.912 --> 53:40.113
So ya know, I
live in San Diego.

53:40.115 --> 53:41.984
I could give you a ride
if you want.

53:41.986 --> 53:43.585
Seriously?

53:43.587 --> 53:45.754
Yeah, ya know, I need
the company anyway.

53:45.756 --> 53:47.122
That would
actually be amazing.

53:47.124 --> 53:48.189
Great.

53:48.191 --> 53:50.558
Not to be rude or anything but,

53:50.560 --> 53:53.828

55:41.612 --> 55:42.812
Chuchu or something like that.

55:42.814 --> 55:44.045
That could
totally be a fake name.

55:44.047 --> 55:46.348
It sounds like a
fake name, right?

55:46.350 --> 55:47.949
You got something

I think I'm gonna stick around.

01:04:22.432 --> 01:04:23.598
Give me 50 bucks.

01:04:25.669 --> 01:04:27.401

01:05:42.984 --> 01:05:44.984
No, not yet.

01:05:44.986 --> 01:05:46.719
Not yet, why?

01:05:46.721 --> 01:05:47.987
Nick, you said to me,
"Donny, be here tomorrow.

01:05:47.989 --> 01:05:48.989
I'll have the rest
of your money."

01:05:48.991 --> 01:05:49.989
I'm here, Nick.

01:05:49.991 --> 01:05:51.290
Where's the money?

01:05:51.292 --> 01:05:52.292
I'll have it.

01:05:52.294 --> 01:05:53.292
I just have to go up to El Tay.

01:05:53.294 --> 01:05:54.694

Don't want me freaking out?

01:06:02.505 --> 01:06:04.271

No fuckin' way, you know

01:06:08.010 --> 01:06:09.410
Rod, no.
No fuckin' way.

01:06:09.412 --> 01:06:10.744
Hey, he has a kid now.

01:06:10.746 --> 01:06:11.778

- Oh, great.

01:06:11.780 --> 01:06:13.547
Or he bought the kid.

01:06:13.549 --> 01:06:14.915
Trust me.

01:06:14.917 --> 01:06:16.917
Besides, we got bigger problems.

01:06:29.733 --> 01:06:30.635
I don't know.

01:06:33.538 --> 01:06:34.871
You think it's her?

01:06:34.873 --> 01:06:36.438

01:06:36.440 --> 01:06:37.606
Fuck yeah, I think it's her.

01:06:37.608 --> 01:06:39.474
She's the fuckin' voodoo curse.

01:06:39.476 --> 01:06:40.976
Tried to kill her, I

01:06:40.978 --> 01:06:43.445

01:06:46.519 --> 01:06:47.785
Shit she put me through
the past couple days,

01:06:47.787 --> 01:06:50.620
you would not believe
bro, seriously.

01:06:50.622 --> 01:06:52.689
You need to fuckin' move
away from me right now, okay?

01:06:52.691 --> 01:06:53.924
Seriously.

01:06:53.926 --> 01:06:57.328
- Good morning, lovers!
- Jesus.

01:06:57.330 --> 01:06:58.629
How was your night?

01:06:58.631 --> 01:06:59.796
Freddie, you're back.

01:06:59.798 --> 01:07:02.000
- Z.
- Oh, my God. Oh!

01:07:02.002 --> 01:07:05.005
- I'm gonna go tell Nick.
- Okay.

01:07:11.411 --> 01:07:12.313
Thanks.

01:07:14.547 --> 01:07:15.880
Think nothin' of it.

01:07:15.882 --> 01:07:17.482
I really mean it, Freddie,

01:07:17.484 --> 01:07:19.718
I'd have gone away, gone away.

01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:21.053
Thank you.

01:07:21.055 --> 01:07:25.890
It was a shitty prize anyway.

01:07:25.892 --> 01:07:27.993
- Feed me?
- Yeah.

01:07:27.995 --> 01:07:29.394
- Please?
- Alright.

01:07:30.664 --> 01:07:32.868
Hey, Nick, Freddie's back.

01:07:34.002 --> 01:07:35.601
What?

01:07:35.603 --> 01:07:36.936
Hey, don't go anywhere.

01:07:36.938 --> 01:07:37.839
Yeah.

01:07:42.478 --> 01:07:43.946
What the hell are
you lookin' at?

01:07:47.750 --> 01:07:49.050
Where the fuck are they, Z?

01:07:49.052 --> 01:07:52.120
They were right here.

01:07:52.122 --> 01:07:54.421
Shit, we gotta go, man.

01:07:54.423 --> 01:07:55.124
Fuck!

01:07:58.994 --> 01:08:00.660
Where's Donny and that chick?

01:08:00.662 --> 01:08:02.463
They were with you,
man, what happened?

01:08:02.465 --> 01:08:04.065
Hey, wanna bite?

01:08:04.067 --> 01:08:06.701
- Hi.
- Hi!

01:08:06.703 --> 01:08:09.438
Z, stay in case
they come back, okay?

01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:10.438
No.

01:08:10.440 --> 01:08:11.540
Otto, stay with Z.

01:08:11.542 --> 01:08:12.775
Okay.

01:08:12.777 --> 01:08:14.676
- Freddie, you coming?
- Mm-hmm.

01:08:14.678 --> 01:08:16.810
We'll be back in like
an hour and a half?

01:08:16.813 --> 01:08:18.046
- All right.
- Bye, guys.

01:08:18.048 --> 01:08:20.515
See you.

01:08:20.518 --> 01:08:23.087
Why the fuck did
you say that, man?

01:08:26.457 --> 01:08:27.526
Yep.

01:08:29.560 --> 01:08:31.026
Always left behind.

01:08:31.028 --> 01:08:33.694
Don't complain, man.

01:08:33.697 --> 01:08:34.697
Otto.

01:08:34.698 --> 01:08:35.832
Hmm?

01:08:35.834 --> 01:08:37.968
Otto.

01:08:37.970 --> 01:08:39.872
This is real bad, man.

01:08:41.840 --> 01:08:43.640
Fucker, is that Donny?

01:08:43.643 --> 01:08:45.145
What the fuck is going on, dude?

01:08:49.549 --> 01:08:50.850
Come on, help me.

01:08:52.752 --> 01:08:54.553
Help me, fuck!

01:08:54.555 --> 01:08:57.121
Freddie, what happened?

01:08:57.122 --> 01:08:58.723
I got arrested.

01:08:58.725 --> 01:09:00.724
I know that.

01:09:00.725 --> 01:09:02.027
When'd you get out?

01:09:02.029 --> 01:09:03.161
Last night.

01:09:03.162 --> 01:09:05.029
Where you been?

01:09:05.032 --> 01:09:08.468
Eating bonbons in
the back of a limo.

01:09:08.470 --> 01:09:09.969
Come on, Nick, where do
you think I've been?

01:09:09.970 --> 01:09:11.037
Hey.

01:09:11.038 --> 01:09:12.237
Yeah?

01:09:12.238 --> 01:09:13.939
Come on, talk to me.

01:09:13.941 --> 01:09:15.073
Really?

01:09:15.075 --> 01:09:17.777
Yeah, really.

01:09:17.779 --> 01:09:22.180
Okay, I got arrested
and then I got out

01:09:22.182 --> 01:09:25.652
and some really fucked up people
helped me get here

01:09:25.654 --> 01:09:27.621
and that's it.

01:09:27.622 --> 01:09:30.756
Nothing bad happened to you?

01:09:30.758 --> 01:09:31.957
Like?

01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:34.895
Freddie, come on.

01:09:34.897 --> 01:09:36.832
I'm good, okay?

01:09:38.166 --> 01:09:41.636
Really happy to see you.

01:09:41.638 --> 01:09:42.973
I'm happy to see Otto and Z.

01:09:44.875 --> 01:09:46.109
And...

01:09:48.277 --> 01:09:51.182
I'm happy to finally relax.

01:09:52.948 --> 01:09:54.084
I'm tired.

01:09:56.686 --> 01:09:58.023
I'm really tired.

01:10:13.805 --> 01:10:16.005
We don't have
the fuckin' keys.

01:10:16.007 --> 01:10:17.107
I got this.

01:10:17.109 --> 01:10:18.644
- Got a knife?
- Yeah.

01:10:24.917 --> 01:10:27.116
Where'd you learn this,
Connecticut?

01:10:27.118 --> 01:10:28.154
Nantucket.

01:10:49.143 --> 01:10:51.145
Nick, hi.

01:10:54.747 --> 01:10:56.981
Guy, do you remember Nick?

01:10:56.983 --> 01:10:58.316
Nick's a friend of Daddy's

01:10:58.318 --> 01:10:59.919
and a business associate.

01:10:59.921 --> 01:11:02.989
Hey, Bird, this is Freddie.

01:11:02.991 --> 01:11:04.324
She's an artist.

01:11:04.326 --> 01:11:08.026
Nice, I'm a sculptor.

01:11:08.028 --> 01:11:10.128
Well, looks like you did
real well with that one.

01:11:10.130 --> 01:11:13.165
I did, but I had some help.

01:11:13.167 --> 01:11:16.336
Rod, Nick's here!

01:11:16.338 --> 01:11:18.805
He's feeling so
much better today.

01:11:18.807 --> 01:11:21.008
Aren't you?
Wanna hold him?

01:11:21.010 --> 01:11:24.143
Oh, no, not really,
that's not my thing.

01:11:24.145 --> 01:11:25.678
Aw, you're a natural.

01:11:25.680 --> 01:11:26.746
Nick, good to see ya, buddy.

01:11:26.748 --> 01:11:27.747
Hey, man.

01:11:27.749 --> 01:11:29.683
Hi, I'm Freddie.

01:11:29.685 --> 01:11:31.085
Nice to meet you.

01:11:31.087 --> 01:11:32.287
Freddie, I'm Rod,
nice to meet you.

01:11:32.289 --> 01:11:33.287
You want a beer?

01:11:33.289 --> 01:11:34.688
Yeah, sure.

01:11:34.690 --> 01:11:35.892
Come on in.

01:11:47.370 --> 01:11:48.938
You light it?

01:11:48.940 --> 01:11:50.875
Yeah, yesterday.

01:11:58.749 --> 01:12:00.882
I gotta say it

01:12:00.884 --> 01:12:02.051
just 'cause I gotta say it.

01:12:02.053 --> 01:12:03.252
It's good stuff, man.

01:12:03.254 --> 01:12:06.289
This is Angel's money.

01:12:06.291 --> 01:12:08.025
I can't have any
shit going down.

01:12:08.027 --> 01:12:09.996
You're gonna be asking me
for more next week.

01:12:15.334 --> 01:12:16.301
Good shit, Nick.

01:12:24.743 --> 01:12:27.945
You know, there's not a time
in my life I've been happier.

01:12:27.947 --> 01:12:29.949
That's awesome, Rod.

01:12:38.859 --> 01:12:40.160
Cute kid, homie.

01:12:44.164 --> 01:12:45.264
Do anything to
protect our babies,

01:12:45.266 --> 01:12:46.432
now wouldn't we, huh?

01:12:46.434 --> 01:12:49.000
Who the fuck are you?

01:12:49.002 --> 01:12:50.201
Get your hands off
my fuckin' kid.

01:12:50.203 --> 01:12:51.469
Hey, hey, hey, relax, man.

01:12:51.471 --> 01:12:53.305
Just call me the
candy man, homeboy.

01:12:53.307 --> 01:12:56.309
You just gotta stand there
and listen, stay calm, homie.

01:12:56.311 --> 01:12:59.445
Hey, you just relax, alright?

01:12:59.447 --> 01:13:01.214
- Oh, yeah.
- Shit.

01:13:01.216 --> 01:13:02.415
What's up, motherfuckers?

01:13:02.417 --> 01:13:04.317
Shoot him, ese, shoot him now!

01:13:04.319 --> 01:13:07.287
See, all I wanted to do
is kill this dumbass.

01:13:07.289 --> 01:13:08.989
Get your ass back in the car.

01:13:08.991 --> 01:13:11.225
All I want to do was
kill this dumbass ho.

01:13:11.227 --> 01:13:14.060
Stay still! And then I got to
thinkin', I said,

01:13:14.062 --> 01:13:18.399
"Self, why don't we put Lobo
in his motherfuckin' place,

01:13:18.401 --> 01:13:21.101
in a body bag," and then
I'm gonna kill you

01:13:21.103 --> 01:13:22.936
like I was gonna
do anyway, right?

01:13:22.938 --> 01:13:25.507
Shh. This my favorite part,
this my favorite part,

01:13:25.509 --> 01:13:27.142
this is my favorite part.

01:13:27.144 --> 01:13:30.145
We make a ton of money,
that's what we call

01:13:30.147 --> 01:13:31.146
gettin' paid for
doing what we love.

01:13:31.148 --> 01:13:32.847
Right, Beef?

01:13:32.849 --> 01:13:34.415
And that's why we
takin' all the money.

01:13:34.417 --> 01:13:37.084
Oh, we gonna take all
the motherfuckin' money.

01:13:37.086 --> 01:13:40.122
Fucking asshole!

01:13:40.124 --> 01:13:41.223
Fuckin' kill you!

01:13:41.225 --> 01:13:42.759
I'll fucking kill you!

01:13:44.828 --> 01:13:47.796
Man, shoot this bitch, Beef!

01:13:47.798 --> 01:13:51.136
Oh!

01:13:54.239 --> 01:13:56.273
Give me my fucking kid,

01:13:56.275 --> 01:13:58.341
you fucking wetback scum,
before I blow your brains

01:13:58.343 --> 01:13:59.542
all over this fuckin' place.

01:14:02.314 --> 01:14:05.181
Oh, I can taste it.
I can taste it, hey.

01:14:05.183 --> 01:14:10.053
Hey, you got the baby wipes?
Oh! Oh! Okay.

01:14:10.055 --> 01:14:12.122
Can I ask a question?

01:14:12.124 --> 01:14:14.391
Oh, shit, man,
it's Helen Keller.

01:14:14.393 --> 01:14:17.028
Helen, oh! Oh! Oh!

01:14:17.030 --> 01:14:19.163
See, see,
now I can fuck you now!

01:14:19.165 --> 01:14:21.231
Can somebody please tell me
what the hell is going on?

01:14:21.233 --> 01:14:23.568
Like seriously, how the
fuck do you guys get here?

01:14:23.570 --> 01:14:25.302
That ain't none of
your damn business,

01:14:25.304 --> 01:14:26.538
little white whore.

01:14:26.540 --> 01:14:28.207
Oh, my God.

01:14:28.209 --> 01:14:30.109
I'm not a fucking whore!

01:14:30.111 --> 01:14:32.811
Seriously, I have been
arrested, hustled,

01:14:32.813 --> 01:14:34.980
jerked off on and sold today,

01:14:34.982 --> 01:14:37.216
all with less than
two hours of sleep.

01:14:37.218 --> 01:14:39.552
So if you kill me right now,
I would probably feel

01:14:39.554 --> 01:14:42.555
so much fuckin' better
than I do.

01:14:42.557 --> 01:14:44.223
So will someone please
just tell me what the fuck

01:14:44.225 --> 01:14:46.425
is going on
so if I die right now,

01:14:46.427 --> 01:14:48.394
at least I know why?

01:14:48.396 --> 01:14:50.129
Hey, man, shoot her, man.

01:14:50.131 --> 01:14:51.932
It was for your protection,
it was protection.

01:14:51.934 --> 01:14:54.934
It was about buying
protection for the wetback.

01:14:54.936 --> 01:14:56.268
Sorry, but right?

01:14:56.270 --> 01:14:57.504
Because one of your boys
was killed?

01:14:57.506 --> 01:14:58.972
Beef, shoot her ass!

01:14:58.974 --> 01:15:00.340
Man, I shot the
last one, alright?

01:15:00.342 --> 01:15:02.076
I got brain in
my eye right now.

01:15:02.078 --> 01:15:03.210
Oh, but that's right, isn't it?

01:15:03.212 --> 01:15:04.377
- Fuck it.
- Hey, hey, hey.

01:15:04.379 --> 01:15:06.179
Not happening, fat boy.

01:15:06.181 --> 01:15:07.481
Oh, my God, please don't
fucking shoot each other.

01:15:07.483 --> 01:15:09.317
Please, please!

01:15:09.319 --> 01:15:10.617
Just tell me how much money
you're fighting over.

01:15:10.619 --> 01:15:11.885
Shut up, Freddie!

01:15:11.887 --> 01:15:13.453
No, tell me how much money!

01:15:13.455 --> 01:15:15.356
Freddie, shut the fuck up.

01:15:15.358 --> 01:15:18.292
If it's less than $300,000,
you all need to fuckin'

01:15:18.294 --> 01:15:21.462
stop shushing me and hear me out

01:15:21.464 --> 01:15:24.332
'cause I've got a story to tell.

01:15:33.445 --> 01:15:34.543
I'm listening.

01:15:38.049 --> 01:15:39.449
Hi, Mickey!

01:15:39.451 --> 01:15:41.184
Oh, it's good to see you.

01:15:41.186 --> 01:15:43.552
Ya know, I was gonna say sorry

01:15:43.554 --> 01:15:45.622
for being late on my
first day of work,

01:15:45.624 --> 01:15:48.625
but then I thought,

01:15:48.627 --> 01:15:52.896
huh, I clocked in
hours ago, didn't I?

01:15:52.898 --> 01:15:57.000
So, uh, no sorries for you.

01:15:57.002 --> 01:15:59.436
How the hell did you
know where I lived?

01:15:59.438 --> 01:16:02.039
Good trick knows
everything about her pimp.

01:16:03.577 --> 01:16:06.244
But I'm not mad, so, um,

01:16:06.246 --> 01:16:07.679
why don't you invite me in
and I'll tell you

01:16:07.681 --> 01:16:09.513
everything that happened.

01:16:09.515 --> 01:16:11.616
Who is it, babe?

01:16:11.618 --> 01:16:13.652
Hi, I'm Mickey's sister.

01:16:13.654 --> 01:16:16.688
He doesn't really talk about
our side of the family much

01:16:16.690 --> 01:16:18.522
'cause he's embarrassed.

01:16:18.524 --> 01:16:20.693
It's 'cause Mom's
a stripper, isn't it?

01:16:20.695 --> 01:16:23.162
Same old dirty Daddy though.

01:16:23.164 --> 01:16:24.563
Frank had other kids?

01:16:24.565 --> 01:16:26.131
No, she's lying.

01:16:26.133 --> 01:16:27.366
True.

01:16:27.368 --> 01:16:31.103
He actually drugged me
and sold me

01:16:31.105 --> 01:16:37.343
just this morning to a
real ugly fella for $200.

01:16:37.345 --> 01:16:39.145
That sounds more like
the Mickey you know,

01:16:39.147 --> 01:16:41.181
doesn't it?

01:16:41.183 --> 01:16:44.717
So what do you want?

01:16:44.719 --> 01:16:48.458
Oh, Mickey.

01:16:49.991 --> 01:16:52.192
It's not me that wants it.

01:16:54.965 --> 01:16:56.133
Boom, boom, boom.

01:16:57.701 --> 01:16:58.903
It's them.

01:17:01.103 --> 01:17:03.070
Oh, that was good.

01:17:03.072 --> 01:17:06.441
Admit it, that was so good.

01:17:06.443 --> 01:17:08.142
Oh, and they're like totally
gonna rob you right now.

01:17:08.144 --> 01:17:09.344
Yeah.

01:17:09.346 --> 01:17:12.380
And how did I know
where you lived?

01:17:12.382 --> 01:17:15.183
I looked in your
glove box, asshole.

01:17:15.185 --> 01:17:16.352
You gotta be fucking
kidding me right now.

01:17:16.354 --> 01:17:18.256
Shut the fuck up.

01:17:22.426 --> 01:17:24.393
Shit.

01:17:24.395 --> 01:17:26.595
Let fucking go of me,
you piece of shit.

01:17:26.597 --> 01:17:29.032
Oh, no, no, no, he doesn't
like to be talked to like that.

01:17:29.034 --> 01:17:31.300
Fuck this little kid, Mickey!
Do something!

01:17:31.302 --> 01:17:33.103
What exactly do you want me
to fucking do right now?

01:17:33.105 --> 01:17:35.138
Something, damn it!

01:17:35.140 --> 01:17:36.372
Stop fucking smelling me.

01:17:36.374 --> 01:17:38.308
Oh, shit, you bitch.

01:17:38.310 --> 01:17:39.643
You broke my fucking nose!

01:17:39.645 --> 01:17:41.045
Handle your business, Beef.

01:17:41.047 --> 01:17:43.014
Shoot this bitch.

01:17:46.785 --> 01:17:48.586
Yeah, she broke it.

01:17:48.588 --> 01:17:50.253
She broke my nose.

01:17:50.255 --> 01:17:54.692
So, are you gonna tell us
where the money is

01:17:54.694 --> 01:17:56.494
or do we have to find it?

01:17:56.496 --> 01:17:59.397
You think I'm fucking
scared of you bitches?

01:17:59.399 --> 01:18:01.466
Coming into my fuckin' house,
let's go, come on.

01:18:01.468 --> 01:18:05.270
Let's go.

01:18:05.272 --> 01:18:08.172
Whoa, okay!

01:18:08.174 --> 01:18:11.544
You must be stupid or you
just wanna fuckin' die.

01:18:11.546 --> 01:18:14.146
Get this dumb motherfucker
out my face.

01:18:14.148 --> 01:18:17.282
Shut the hell up, man, yo,

01:18:17.284 --> 01:18:20.486
Ain't no beef in the house,

01:18:20.488 --> 01:18:21.590
Sit down.

01:18:24.059 --> 01:18:25.590
Get that fucking gun

01:18:25.592 --> 01:18:31.165
Mickey's getting robbed.
Mickey's getting robbed.

01:18:31.167 --> 01:18:34.567
Mickey, Mickey, Mickey.

01:18:36.337 --> 01:18:38.640
Isn't this fun?

01:18:40.775 --> 01:18:43.377
I'm gonna find you and
you're gonna pay for this.

01:18:43.379 --> 01:18:45.779
You little fucking cunt.

01:18:45.781 --> 01:18:50.518
Oh, oh.

01:18:50.520 --> 01:18:52.519
Little cunt?

01:18:52.521 --> 01:18:53.755
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:18:58.695 --> 01:19:03.599
Ya know, you should
be a nicer hostess.

01:19:03.601 --> 01:19:06.304
Your guests might turn on you
with this attitude.

01:19:08.138 --> 01:19:10.239
You fuckin' bitch.

01:19:10.241 --> 01:19:12.210
- Hi, guys!
- Fuckin' bitch.

01:19:16.581 --> 01:19:17.482
Come on, come on.

01:19:24.156 --> 01:19:26.289
Oh, the American dream, baby.

01:19:26.291 --> 01:19:27.723
You over here beatin' up Barbie.

01:19:29.127 --> 01:19:32.229
Oh, man, oh, yes.

01:19:32.231 --> 01:19:33.697
Did I do good?

01:19:33.699 --> 01:19:36.467
Oh, you did, Helen!
Oh, you did good.

01:19:36.469 --> 01:19:37.834

01:19:37.836 --> 01:19:39.303
Whoa, whoa, whoa,

01:19:39.305 --> 01:19:40.771

Nah, nah, nah, we making

01:19:42.742 --> 01:19:44.241
And you gonna get that gun

01:19:44.243 --> 01:19:45.276
face, homeboy.

01:19:45.278 --> 01:19:46.343
Hey, put the phone down.

01:19:46.345 --> 01:19:47.345
Hey, shut the fuck up, man,

01:19:47.347 --> 01:19:49.180
we makin' a deal, homie.

01:19:49.182 --> 01:19:50.648
Look, that wasn't the
part of the fuckin' deal.

01:19:50.650 --> 01:19:51.849
It's part of the
fuckin' deal, alright?

01:19:51.851 --> 01:19:52.850
- No, it ain't.
- Yes, it is.

01:19:52.852 --> 01:19:53.885
No, it wasn't!

01:19:53.887 --> 01:19:55.153
What you gonna do, huh?

01:19:55.155 --> 01:19:56.154
Put the phone down.

01:19:56.156 --> 01:19:57.488
We gotta go.

01:19:57.490 --> 01:19:58.724
Yeah, I
will take your ass out.

01:19:58.726 --> 01:20:00.459
No, no, no, no.

01:20:00.461 --> 01:20:01.460
Let go of me.

01:20:01.462 --> 01:20:02.728
We're leaving now.

01:20:02.730 --> 01:20:04.329
No, you've done
enough for today.

01:20:04.331 --> 01:20:05.564
Stop it, Nick.

01:20:05.566 --> 01:20:06.698
Not a game, Freddie.

01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:09.234
Okay, fine, fucking stop.

01:20:09.236 --> 01:20:12.337
Gosh, you can stop
manhandling me.

01:20:22.451 --> 01:20:23.751
See what you made me do?

01:20:23.753 --> 01:20:24.752
I had to shoot the damn phone.

01:20:28.823 --> 01:20:31.228
Okay, I just wanted
to say goodbye.

01:20:33.629 --> 01:20:35.763
You are fuckin' ridiculous.

01:20:35.765 --> 01:20:37.831
I know. Um...

01:20:37.833 --> 01:20:39.170
Thanks for not
shooting each other.

01:20:40.871 --> 01:20:42.536
I hope you buy
lots of nice things

01:20:42.538 --> 01:20:44.705
and like, ya know,
take each other out

01:20:44.707 --> 01:20:46.476
for fancy meals and stuff.

01:20:47.810 --> 01:20:50.544
Listen, I'm not
a gang obviously.

01:20:50.546 --> 01:20:51.847
Mm-mm.

01:20:51.849 --> 01:20:53.886
But thanks for
letting me pretend.

01:20:57.422 --> 01:20:58.323
You welcome.

01:21:04.828 --> 01:21:07.667
She brings something
special outta me.

01:21:15.841 --> 01:21:19.275
It's bad business
selling little girls.

01:21:19.277 --> 01:21:21.877
Ya know,

01:21:21.879 --> 01:21:26.316
I hope you live through this.

01:21:26.318 --> 01:21:28.586
But if you don't,

01:21:28.588 --> 01:21:32.623
you only have yourself to blame.

01:22:11.501 --> 01:22:14.902
Hit me, hit me!

01:22:14.904 --> 01:22:17.337
Oh.

01:22:17.339 --> 01:22:19.607
Donny, hey!

01:22:19.609 --> 01:22:20.675
Hey.

01:22:20.677 --> 01:22:21.709
You got my money, ese?

01:22:21.711 --> 01:22:23.777
Yeah.

01:22:23.779 --> 01:22:24.778
Where's Chuchu?

01:22:24.780 --> 01:22:28.617
Uh, I lost her.

01:22:31.021 --> 01:22:32.688
Nice work.

01:22:32.690 --> 01:22:33.988
Where?

01:22:33.990 --> 01:22:35.657
In the desert.

01:22:35.659 --> 01:22:38.359
We were kinda high
and I lost her

01:22:38.361 --> 01:22:40.528
but I'm sure she's fine though.
Okay?

01:22:40.530 --> 01:22:41.796
Who fucking cares
if she's fine?

01:22:41.798 --> 01:22:42.831
I fucking care, okay?

01:22:42.833 --> 01:22:44.033
So shut the fuck up, outlaw.

01:22:44.035 --> 01:22:45.501
- Oh, shut the fuck up?
- Yeah.

01:22:45.503 --> 01:22:47.673
You shut the fuck up.

01:22:54.646 --> 01:22:57.446
Ah, my little Indian whore!

01:22:58.782 --> 01:23:00.651
Alright, I'm
gonna take off, man.

01:23:00.653 --> 01:23:02.553
Hey, hey, hey, Donny.

01:23:02.555 --> 01:23:04.620
Wait, come here.

01:23:04.622 --> 01:23:06.490
No, no, no, no.
No more gifts, alright?

01:23:06.492 --> 01:23:07.790
Please, Venice, would you
tell him no more gifts.

01:23:07.792 --> 01:23:09.125
Paolo, I totally
lost the last one.

01:23:09.127 --> 01:23:10.596
I can't do this again,
alright, please.

01:23:13.698 --> 01:23:15.500
Aw.

01:23:15.502 --> 01:23:17.701
This is you.

01:23:17.703 --> 01:23:20.073
Take it.
Take it.

01:23:22.743 --> 01:23:24.445
You're in your own hands now.

01:23:26.813 --> 01:23:29.747
And now, you're in my hands.

01:23:29.749 --> 01:23:30.915
No!

01:23:35.490 --> 01:23:39.561
Thank you.

01:23:41.596 --> 01:23:42.763
I'll see ya.

01:23:53.474 --> 01:23:55.609
Rod, by the way,

01:23:55.611 --> 01:23:57.977
I'm super sorry
about what happened.

01:23:57.979 --> 01:24:00.083
Nah, it's all sorted.

01:24:04.453 --> 01:24:07.657
Anyway, I kinda miss
that rush, you know?

01:24:10.193 --> 01:24:12.893
It's good.

01:24:12.895 --> 01:24:14.195
Did you bury her?

01:24:14.197 --> 01:24:15.562
Hey.

01:24:15.564 --> 01:24:17.664
Nick, it's okay.

01:24:17.666 --> 01:24:19.701
Yeah.

01:24:19.703 --> 01:24:21.637
Yeah, I did.

01:24:21.639 --> 01:24:22.539
Good.

01:24:25.810 --> 01:24:28.643
Rod, would you mind if
I made a phone call?

01:24:28.645 --> 01:24:31.647
It's long distance,
but it won't be too long.

01:24:31.649 --> 01:24:32.880
Sure, kid, phone's in the back.

01:24:32.882 --> 01:24:33.851
Thank you.

01:24:40.592 --> 01:24:42.559
Who you calling?

01:24:42.561 --> 01:24:43.562
My brother.

01:24:44.896 --> 01:24:47.729
Ah, okay.

01:24:47.731 --> 01:24:49.599
I'll see ya out there.

01:24:49.601 --> 01:24:50.536
Yeah.

01:24:52.504 --> 01:24:54.007
The Victims.

01:24:56.508 --> 01:24:57.410
What?

01:24:59.245 --> 01:25:02.112
That would've
been my gang name.

01:25:02.114 --> 01:25:03.016
Deception tactic.

01:25:04.916 --> 01:25:06.249
You're dangerous.

01:25:06.251 --> 01:25:09.624
Don't confuse
tactics with character.

01:25:20.701 --> 01:25:21.602
Hello?

01:25:22.702 --> 01:25:23.902
Hugo?

01:25:23.904 --> 01:25:24.904
So good to hear your voice.

01:25:24.906 --> 01:25:25.905
How are you, buddy?

01:25:25.907 --> 01:25:28.074
I'm cool, where are you?

01:25:28.076 --> 01:25:29.075
<i>Southern California.</i>

01:25:29.077 --> 01:25:30.642
Just below LA.

01:25:30.644 --> 01:25:31.910
<i>Hey, is Mom there?</i>

01:25:31.912 --> 01:25:33.713
Um, date with Richard.

01:25:33.715 --> 01:25:35.548
Good, okay, are you
ready for this story?

01:25:35.550 --> 01:25:37.249
- Uh-huh.
- <i>Okay, so last night,</i>

01:25:37.251 --> 01:25:38.885
I was in the hood,
and I ended up

01:25:38.887 --> 01:25:41.722
in the middle of this
crazy ass race war.

01:25:41.724 --> 01:25:43.624
- <i>In Compton?</i>
- <i>Close.</i>

01:25:43.626 --> 01:25:45.024
Were people getting shot at?

01:25:45.026 --> 01:25:46.893
No, but these two gangsters
kept threatening

01:25:46.895 --> 01:25:48.762
- to beat me up.
- What?

01:25:48.764 --> 01:25:50.898
Yeah, but then we all became
friends, so it was okay.

01:25:50.900 --> 01:25:53.634
No way.

01:25:53.636 --> 01:25:54.835
<i>Yeah,
oh, and guess what!</i>

01:25:54.837 --> 01:25:55.970
What?

01:25:55.972 --> 01:25:57.939
Lowrider mission
accomplished.

01:25:57.941 --> 01:26:00.711
Holy crap, did
they have hydraulics?

01:26:06.950 --> 01:26:09.884
Yeah, it was pretty wild.

01:26:09.886 --> 01:26:13.588
I really wish that you
were with me for that part.

01:26:13.590 --> 01:26:14.757
How's everything back home?

01:26:14.759 --> 01:26:15.925
<i>Fine.</i>

01:26:15.927 --> 01:26:16.992
<i>And Mom?</i>

01:26:16.994 --> 01:26:18.827
I don't know.

01:26:18.829 --> 01:26:20.628
<i>I miss you both.</i>

01:26:20.630 --> 01:26:22.197
<i>Miss you too.</i>

01:26:22.199 --> 01:26:24.833
But don't come home for us.

01:26:24.835 --> 01:26:26.167
Okay?

01:26:26.169 --> 01:26:27.105
Promise?

01:26:28.607 --> 01:26:29.841
Yeah, I promise.

01:26:31.309 --> 01:26:33.142
Alright, will you tell Mom
that I love her

01:26:33.144 --> 01:26:34.145
and not to worry?

01:26:35.714 --> 01:26:37.015
<i>She raised me right.</i>

01:26:38.916 --> 01:26:40.350
<i>See you soon.</i>

01:26:40.352 --> 01:26:42.285
I promise.
