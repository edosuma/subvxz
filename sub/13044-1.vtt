No.

42:50.360 --> 42:53.440

- Why should I?

42:53.520 --> 42:56.600
Because you’re

I ever have to be good at something.

43:42.560 --> 43:45.960
- You have to steer.
- Yeah, well, so does a kid in a tricycle.

43:46.040 --> 43:49.440
At least he’s pedaling.
Soap box derby isn’t a sport. It’s gravity.

43:49.520 --> 43:52.680
- Shut up, Seth.
- Come on. Let’s check out the pits.

43:52.760 --> 43:55.800

Dad, tell Seth
he’s not funny.

43:57.880 --> 44:01.440
Seth, you’re not funny.
So, what makes this competitive?

44:01.520 --> 44:03.560
Well, the steering,
for one.

44:03.600 --> 44:07.560
Every tiny swerve creates friction
which wastes precious time.

44:07.600 --> 44:11.400
The best drivers learn to check
the bumps and rolls in the road...

44:11.480 --> 44:13.400
just like a golfing green.

44:13.480 --> 44:16.720
- Why are they weighing the cars?
- Keeps things fair.

44:16.800 --> 44:20.960
The total weight of the car plus driver
must be exactly the same thing.

44:21.040 --> 44:23.520
- How much do you weigh?
- Seventy-two pounds.

44:23.600 --> 44:28.400
That’s not good for football, but it’s
an advantage for a soap box derby driver.

44:28.480 --> 44:31.440
- Why?
- Well, each car and driver...

44:31.560 --> 44:34.560
must weigh exactly
250 pounds.

44:34.640 --> 44:37.960
Typical car weighs 80 pounds.
Add his 70...

44:38.040 --> 44:41.320
gives you about 100 pounds
of ballast to play around with.

44:41.400 --> 44:43.320

- Yeah.

44:43.400 --> 44:46.760
Where you place the metal weights
in these cars...

44:46.840 --> 44:50.080
can help shave off
a couple of hundredths of a second.

44:50.160 --> 44:52.280
Yeah, but how much
difference could it make?

44:52.360 --> 44:55.960
Well, a lot when the average
margin of victory...

44:56.040 --> 44:58.400
is less than
a tenth of a second.

44:59.840 --> 45:02.560
These are the tricks
you’ll learn as you go along.

45:02.640 --> 45:07.920
You know, some people swear that a black
nose cone will help make the car go faster.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.760
Mm-mm-mm.

45:09.840 --> 45:13.600
Looking in somebody
else’s car is a definite no-no.

45:13.680 --> 45:16.960

45:20.120 --> 45:23.280

- I’m not a driver.
- I guess not.

45:27.200 --> 45:30.080

any special advice...

- Yeah.

Hmm.

45:46.200 --> 45:48.160
What’s with that?

45:48.200 --> 45:50.480
They’re keeping the ball bearings warm
by spinning the wheels.
