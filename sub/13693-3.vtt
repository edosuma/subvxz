00:07.894 --> 00:09.103
Lexie!

00:10.689 --> 00:12.734
-Is it that bad?
-No.

00:12.817 --> 00:17.073
I'm not meant to see
the bride before the big day.

00:17.156 --> 00:19.409
That's the groom, you loon.

00:19.493 --> 00:22.790
Anyway,
I'm not getting married
for another two weeks.

00:22.873 --> 00:28.089
So, what do you think?
I wanted something
simple and elegant.

00:28.172 --> 00:30.008
It's great.

00:33.387 --> 00:35.516
Dead sexy.

00:35.599 --> 00:39.979
Duncan, you think
underwear catalogues
are dead sexy.

00:40.064 --> 00:42.066
No, really.

00:42.859 --> 00:44.736
You're beautiful.

00:46.781 --> 00:48.867
Thanks.

00:48.951 --> 00:51.788
Anyway, the minister's here,
for the arrangements.

00:51.871 --> 00:55.043
Oh, already?

00:55.127 --> 00:58.631
Duncan, this is the bit
you're not supposed to see.

01:43.152 --> 01:44.570
So, do you miss Glasgow much?

01:44.653 --> 01:46.490
Ach, no.

01:46.573 --> 01:50.162
I had to leave
after they caught me
flogging the candlesticks.

01:50.245 --> 01:52.206
Joke.

01:52.288 --> 01:55.669
Hi. Hi, sorry if I kept
you waiting, Reverend.

01:55.753 --> 01:58.173
Not Reverend, Alice, please.

01:58.256 --> 02:00.551
You must be very excited,
Lexie.

02:00.634 --> 02:02.846
Yeah, well, I might
even turn up this time.

02:02.930 --> 02:05.183
Well,
that's always a good start.

02:05.266 --> 02:07.268
-Please.
-Thank you.

02:07.352 --> 02:11.399
Now, what sort of a service
did you have in mind?

02:11.483 --> 02:14.779
Oh, I don't know,
something traditional.

02:14.862 --> 02:17.116
What, love,
honour and obey, you mean?

02:17.199 --> 02:19.369
Well, love and honour anyway.

02:19.452 --> 02:21.539
You could always
make up your own vows.

02:21.622 --> 02:22.874
Archie, why don't we do that?

02:22.958 --> 02:24.167
I don't know about that.

02:24.251 --> 02:26.546
But you want it
down by the loch.

02:26.629 --> 02:28.841
Yeah, just a few guests,
nothing too grand.

02:28.924 --> 02:33.889
Apart from
the marquee of course,
for the pipe band.

02:33.973 --> 02:36.017
Erm, the pipe band?

02:36.101 --> 02:39.272
And there'll be Highland Games
and a string
quartet in the house.

02:39.355 --> 02:41.650
A full MacDonald
clan gathering in fact.

02:41.733 --> 02:43.903
Just a wee bit grand, then?

02:43.987 --> 02:47.617
Oh, just a couple of hundred
of our closest friends.

02:47.701 --> 02:49.327
Surprise!

02:49.411 --> 02:53.375
What happened to
intimate and homely
and small and special?

02:53.459 --> 02:56.379
Oh, but it will be special,
it will be magnificent,

02:56.463 --> 02:59.300
it'll be a huge celebration
of a momentous day.

02:59.383 --> 03:02.220
Otherwise we might as
well have a quick snog

03:02.304 --> 03:05.017
in the registry office
and nip out for a curry.

03:07.102 --> 03:09.063
Well, you tell her, Alice.

03:09.147 --> 03:11.025
I can't tell you what
sort of a wedding to have.

03:11.108 --> 03:13.445
I can tell you that
whatever you choose,

03:13.528 --> 03:15.740
it has to be
something you both want

03:15.823 --> 03:17.618
with all your heart.

03:19.703 --> 03:22.624
Why don't I come back
in a day or two, hmm?

03:25.045 --> 03:26.129
Yeah, thanks.

03:26.213 --> 03:27.339
Goodbye, now.

03:27.423 --> 03:29.342
-Thank you. Bye.
-Goodbye.

03:37.896 --> 03:39.397
(CAR HORN BLARING)

03:45.240 --> 03:47.576
Ah, well, there we are.

03:48.285 --> 03:50.622
Louis, you found us!

03:50.705 --> 03:54.126
Molly, my darling.

03:54.210 --> 03:58.424
I was afraid I'd
run out of petrol
and get eaten by wolves.

03:58.508 --> 04:01.679
Oh, our wolves are quite
fussy about their diet.

04:01.762 --> 04:03.765
Archie,
this is a very old friend

04:03.849 --> 04:05.810
of Hector's and mine,
Louis Grimshaw.

04:05.893 --> 04:07.479
This is my son, Archie.

04:07.563 --> 04:13.195
Your son! Why, surely not.
How do you do it, my darling?

04:13.279 --> 04:14.613
Well, I'm pleased to meet you.

04:14.697 --> 04:16.825
Yeah, likewise, I'm sure.

04:16.908 --> 04:21.874
You're a very lucky man,
with your mother's looks
and your father's castle.

04:21.957 --> 04:23.918
Louis, Hector and I
spent a lot of our youth

04:24.002 --> 04:25.880
together in London
back in the sixties.

04:25.963 --> 04:30.386
All those wild parties,
you know,
fast cars, high times.

04:30.469 --> 04:34.141
The rest of
the days we just wasted.

04:34.224 --> 04:35.894
Let me get your bag.

04:35.977 --> 04:39.607
Careful,
it's a very valuable antique,
rather like myself.

04:41.693 --> 04:46.491
Oh, listen, old thing,
I'm dreadfully
sorry about Hector.

04:46.575 --> 04:51.248
All these years I've
been meaning to visit,
but I just left it too late.

04:51.332 --> 04:53.210
I'm deeply ashamed.

04:53.293 --> 04:56.839
Never mind, you're here now,
and we're very
pleased to see you.

04:56.923 --> 04:58.509
Oh, good.

04:58.592 --> 05:00.512
I'm getting
readings from all over!

(MAKING SHOOTING NOISES)

05:02.222 --> 05:05.310
They're coming
out of the walls!

05:05.393 --> 05:08.022
Could I have my
plasma rifle please?

05:09.357 --> 05:10.609
Sorry.

05:10.692 --> 05:11.902
What is that thing anyway?

05:11.985 --> 05:14.239
This? It's a tracking device.

05:15.783 --> 05:17.536
Mmm, great.
Could it track down

05:17.619 --> 05:19.246
the socks
the washing machine's eaten?

05:19.329 --> 05:21.457
No, look, it tracks this.

05:21.541 --> 05:24.294
Long range transponder,
state of the art.

05:24.378 --> 05:27.006
We might use it on
the wolves when they go wild.

05:27.090 --> 05:29.928
Archie asked me to
evaluate it for him.

05:30.011 --> 05:33.891
Yeah, I think we might
want to try that outside,
in controlled conditions.

05:33.975 --> 05:35.477
Okay, Arch, yeah.

05:35.561 --> 05:37.397
Irene, my mother's
guest has arrived,

05:37.480 --> 05:39.190
I was wondering if you
could rustle up some tea.

05:39.274 --> 05:41.068
-Consider it rustled.
-Thank you.

05:45.491 --> 05:46.742
Have you talked to Golly yet?

05:46.826 --> 05:48.328
About what?

05:48.412 --> 05:51.749
About another date.
I feel bad that he
was stood up like that.

05:51.833 --> 05:54.128
I didn't realise I
was standing him up.

05:54.211 --> 05:56.631
Oh, no,
no, no, it's just, well...

05:56.715 --> 05:59.218
Golly's a great guy and,
well, you should

05:59.302 --> 06:03.308
get to know him.
Give him another chance.

06:03.391 --> 06:07.564
Look, I'm sure he's very nice,
he just seems a bit
tweedy that's all.

06:07.647 --> 06:10.318
(SNIGGERING) Tweedy?

06:10.401 --> 06:12.529
You know, countrified.

06:12.613 --> 06:15.950
Like he shaves
with broken glass,
keeps a ferret in his sporran.

06:16.034 --> 06:20.165
That's not
a ferret in his sporran,
he's just pleased to see you.

06:27.425 --> 06:28.551
Who's the letter to?

06:28.635 --> 06:30.596
My mother.

06:30.679 --> 06:32.849
I told her it would
be a low-key affair.

06:32.933 --> 06:36.812
Now she'll probably
turn up in a sedan chair
carried by body builders.

06:36.896 --> 06:38.607
Why not just phone her?

06:38.690 --> 06:40.318
Because this way she
can't interrupt me.

06:40.401 --> 06:42.070
We're
interviewing new teachers

06:42.153 --> 06:43.781
for the village
school in half an hour.

06:43.864 --> 06:46.868
What do you want me to do,
check their spelling?

06:46.952 --> 06:48.663
The laird is on
the Board of Governors

06:48.746 --> 06:50.332
and since you're going
to be the laird's wife,

06:50.415 --> 06:52.042
it's kind of
like our civic duty.

06:52.125 --> 06:53.962
Oh, I see.

06:54.045 --> 06:56.590
So I'm meant to smile nicely
and hand out
digestive biscuits.

06:56.674 --> 06:58.301
Hmm-mmm.

06:58.385 --> 07:00.638
And I thought
being a laird's wife
would be boring.

07:00.720 --> 07:02.558
I take it you're
not coming, then?

07:02.641 --> 07:04.685
Seeing as you're so good
at making
arrangements by yourself.

07:10.485 --> 07:13.406
Seems a bit presumptuous,
me chairing
the Board of Governors,

07:13.489 --> 07:15.117
when I've only
been here a few weeks.

07:15.200 --> 07:16.785
No, this lot won't
give you any trouble.

07:16.868 --> 07:19.999
But there's
a bullwhip under your seat
just in case.

07:20.082 --> 07:21.208
How's Lexie?

07:21.292 --> 07:23.211
She's great.

07:23.295 --> 07:25.464
I'll talk her round,
she'll be fine on the day.

07:25.548 --> 07:27.676
You sure about that?

07:27.759 --> 07:29.595
I am going to marry that girl,

07:29.678 --> 07:33.392
even if it means I have
to wheel her up the aisle
strapped to a trolley.

07:33.475 --> 07:37.982
She is the one for me,
the only one
there ever has been.

07:38.065 --> 07:41.612
Looks like our first
candidate's arrived.
Excuse me.

07:44.365 --> 07:46.493
ALICE: How do you do?
Thank you so much

07:46.577 --> 07:48.622
for coming.
Will you take a seat?

08:07.899 --> 08:09.442
Hello, Archie.

08:11.987 --> 08:16.868
So, Miss Finlay,
I understand you used
to be head teacher here?

08:16.953 --> 08:19.206
Yes.
Up until about a year ago.

08:27.510 --> 08:30.013
(CLEARS THROAT)

08:30.097 --> 08:32.140
So, what were
the other candidates like?

08:32.224 --> 08:34.143
I'm sure I'm not
supposed to tell you that.

08:34.227 --> 08:37.106
Oh, come on, Archie, it's me.
Don't get all ethical on me.

08:37.188 --> 08:39.818
How the hell are you?
Why didn't you tell
me you were coming?

08:39.902 --> 08:41.861
Would you have
turned up if I had?

08:41.946 --> 08:43.823
Of course I would.
It's great to see you.

08:43.907 --> 08:45.660
I believe
congratulations are in order.

08:45.743 --> 08:47.413
Sorry?

08:47.496 --> 08:48.789
You and Lexie.

08:48.872 --> 08:51.543
Oh, right, yes, of course.
Thank you.

08:51.626 --> 08:53.421
How does the old song go?

08:53.504 --> 08:55.549
"If you can't be
with the one you love,
love the one you're with."

08:55.632 --> 08:57.049
Yeah.
So, where are you staying?

08:57.134 --> 08:58.678
The B&amp;B.

08:58.761 --> 09:02.182
Ah, yes, with the salty bacon
and the cardboard sausages.

09:02.265 --> 09:04.227
We could have put
you up at the house.

09:04.311 --> 09:06.188
I don't think so, Archie.

09:06.272 --> 09:09.902
Yes. I take it the political
job didn't work out.

09:09.986 --> 09:13.907
No. I got tired of all
the backstabbing and betrayal.

09:13.991 --> 09:18.789
I guess I thought
things would be different
at Glenbogle. Silly me.

09:18.873 --> 09:20.542
Katrina,
you got a better offer.

09:20.626 --> 09:22.169
We talked about
it and you left.

09:22.252 --> 09:24.339
I thought it was over.

09:24.422 --> 09:26.425
It was. It is.

09:26.508 --> 09:28.428
Well, good.
So you can come to supper?

09:28.511 --> 09:30.556
Oh, I don't know.

09:30.640 --> 09:32.559
Come on, we're all grown-ups.
It's in the past.

09:32.643 --> 09:35.813
Everyone would
love to see you.
Mother, Golly, Duncan.

09:35.897 --> 09:38.150
And Lexie?

09:38.233 --> 09:40.111
Yeah, and Lexie.

09:40.195 --> 09:41.988
Unless,
of course, you'd rather eat

09:42.072 --> 09:43.783
half-cooked oven chips
in front of the telly.

09:43.866 --> 09:45.369
Depends what's on.

09:45.452 --> 09:47.664
So, we'll say 6:30
for 7:00, shall we?

10:42.574 --> 10:44.367
-Golly.
-Hi, there.

10:52.463 --> 10:54.173
Where did you get it?

10:54.256 --> 10:56.176
It came free in
a packet of corn flakes.
Where do you think?

10:56.259 --> 10:57.595
Oh, she is gorgeous.

10:57.678 --> 10:59.263
She is, isn't she?

10:59.347 --> 11:03.770
An MGB Roadster with
the original chrome
and the wire wheels.

11:03.853 --> 11:06.106
I had no idea
you were into cars.

11:06.190 --> 11:08.693
Och, well,
maybe there's more to me
than meets the eye.

11:08.777 --> 11:12.156
There's more to this
than meets the eye.
This is full of filler, Golly.

11:12.240 --> 11:16.204
It's not the bodywork, son,
it's what's under
the bonnet that counts.

11:16.287 --> 11:18.248
Do you fancy a wee spin?

11:18.332 --> 11:20.794
Oh, I would love to but
I've got too much to do.

11:20.877 --> 11:24.758
Okay. After work. Take
her for a burn, as they say?

11:24.841 --> 11:26.301
Okay, you're on.

11:26.385 --> 11:27.387
Good.

11:32.977 --> 11:36.107
I'm sorry, Duncan,
but they didn't have
any four-seaters left.

11:46.121 --> 11:47.373
Hi.

11:47.456 --> 11:48.582
Hello.

11:50.168 --> 11:53.506
Archie invited me to dinner.
Did he not tell you?

11:55.426 --> 11:57.094
Funnily enough, no.

11:58.555 --> 11:59.765
Well, don't go to any trouble.

11:59.849 --> 12:02.059
I won't.

12:02.143 --> 12:05.773
I mean, I'm not
the housekeeper any more.

12:05.857 --> 12:09.361
Oh, I forgot,
you've been promoted.
Well, I hope you're happy.

12:11.614 --> 12:13.617
-Meaning?
-What I said.

12:13.701 --> 12:16.038
I hope you and
Archie will be happy.

12:17.457 --> 12:19.208
So, what are you
doing here, then?

12:19.292 --> 12:20.961
Does my being here bother you?

12:22.087 --> 12:23.298
Should it?

12:23.381 --> 12:24.549
Not if Archie loves you, no.

12:24.632 --> 12:27.429
There's no ifs
about it, Katrina.

12:27.512 --> 12:29.724
Ah, ladies,
you've found each other.

12:29.807 --> 12:31.976
I've invited
Katrina to supper.

12:32.060 --> 12:34.063
I'd heard.

12:36.733 --> 12:39.362
Yeah, she's hoping to
come back to Glenbogle.

12:40.822 --> 12:42.450
Looks like she's made it.

12:46.747 --> 12:48.375
I just thought
it would be nice.

12:48.458 --> 12:50.836
MOLLY: ...to have
a flutter on the geegees.

12:50.920 --> 12:52.798
Only when you win, old girl.

12:52.881 --> 12:57.304
I would have wasted less dosh
if I'd bought
a racehorse and shot it.

12:57.388 --> 13:00.683
Oh, Katrina! What a surprise.

13:00.767 --> 13:01.935
Hello, Molly.

13:02.018 --> 13:03.687
Katrina, this is Louis.

13:03.771 --> 13:04.981
Katrina used to teach
at our local school.

13:05.065 --> 13:06.566
Really?

13:06.650 --> 13:09.780
So, Lexie's invited you to
supper, that's wonderful.

13:09.863 --> 13:11.615
I'm not sure if
I'm gonna stay.

13:11.699 --> 13:13.410
MOLLY: Oh, you must, I insist.

13:13.493 --> 13:16.038
I want to hear all your news.

13:17.833 --> 13:19.752
Oh, dear.

13:19.836 --> 13:22.297
You need to turn
the heating up, old boy.

13:22.381 --> 13:24.759
It's distinctly
chilly in here.

13:28.848 --> 13:33.187
What's the matter?
Do the girls not go
for Medallion Man?

13:36.859 --> 13:39.028
Maybe you should buy a car.

13:41.991 --> 13:44.829
Ah, you dirty...

13:56.053 --> 13:57.346
Rabbie!

13:58.848 --> 14:01.018
Rabbie! Come on.

14:03.021 --> 14:04.606
Good bunny.

14:08.528 --> 14:12.951
Go ahead, run. No one
escapes from Glenbogle.

14:17.541 --> 14:19.543
Look, Lex, I'm really sorry.

14:21.171 --> 14:24.217
I thought it
would clear the air.

14:24.300 --> 14:27.012
You know, I used to think
you knew nothing about women.

14:28.515 --> 14:31.727
It was kind of cute.

14:31.811 --> 14:35.274
Now I think you just
line us up like wine glasses
so you can play a wee tune.

14:35.358 --> 14:36.442
Come on.

14:36.526 --> 14:38.028
You've been
doing it for years.

14:38.112 --> 14:41.074
Keeping your women guessing.
Keeping us on our toes.

14:41.157 --> 14:43.786
I was just
trying to be polite.

14:43.869 --> 14:48.000
Oh, right, so I suppose now
you're gonna
politely drive her home.

14:49.502 --> 14:51.171
Unless you'd rather do it.

15:04.189 --> 15:07.236
Yeah, that one there is
the Mountain of the Eagles

15:07.319 --> 15:10.282
and the range next to
it is the Cairngorms.

15:10.365 --> 15:12.702
I love the way
the sky goes on forever.

15:12.785 --> 15:15.038
You wait until you
see the Perseids.

15:15.122 --> 15:16.623
The who?

15:16.707 --> 15:18.168
The Perseids.
It's a meteor shower.

15:18.251 --> 15:19.879
Be happening any day now.

15:19.962 --> 15:22.674
I'll have to take
the washing in now.

15:22.758 --> 15:26.137
And I thought the only
entertainment up here
was shooting things.

15:26.220 --> 15:28.807
Yeah, well,
you can laugh, but I heard

15:28.891 --> 15:31.352
that there was a barn
dance down Taggart's Glen.

15:31.436 --> 15:33.689
A barn dance?

15:33.773 --> 15:37.068
Well,
won't I need a gingham dress
and some straw in my hair?

15:37.153 --> 15:40.282
It's a barn dance, Irene.
The straw will be provided.

15:42.744 --> 15:44.287
(BEEPING)

15:47.959 --> 15:49.586
(BEEPING INTENSIFIES)

15:51.214 --> 15:52.591
Got you.

16:28.266 --> 16:30.978
Now, this is what I
call a highland fling.

16:32.605 --> 16:35.025
Are you coming?

16:35.109 --> 16:37.069
Ah, to hell with it. Let's go.

16:48.085 --> 16:51.131
Good night, Archie.
Thanks for the lift.

16:53.759 --> 16:55.679
Good night, Katrina.

17:08.113 --> 17:09.448
Nice evening?

17:13.329 --> 17:15.915
It would have been
nicer if you'd been there.

17:15.999 --> 17:18.752
Oh,
aye, the laird and his harem?

17:18.836 --> 17:20.297
Archie's not like that.

17:20.380 --> 17:21.964
I know him better than you do.

17:22.049 --> 17:24.511
Then why don't you
trust him, Lexie?

17:30.937 --> 17:33.732
Are you here to get him back?

17:33.816 --> 17:35.944
He's made it pretty
clear he's not available.

17:36.027 --> 17:39.616
Just like a politician,
you can't answer
a straight question.

17:39.699 --> 17:41.284
(LEXIE SIGHING)

17:41.368 --> 17:45.666
Go on then, have a go,
if you think
you're cute enough.

17:45.749 --> 17:47.918
Lexie, you're getting
married in two weeks.

17:48.002 --> 17:50.130
Maybe.

17:50.214 --> 17:53.510
But I won't let any man
play stupid games
with my feelings.

18:11.243 --> 18:12.537
So, how was it?

18:12.620 --> 18:14.038
Brilliant.

18:14.122 --> 18:16.792
You'll have to
speak up, though,
my ears are ringing.

18:16.876 --> 18:18.211
I was getting worried.

18:18.295 --> 18:19.504
We went clubbing.

18:21.340 --> 18:22.676
Clubbing?

18:22.759 --> 18:25.054
Yeah, those baby seals
really take it out of you.

18:26.389 --> 18:28.976
You do know that
Irene's got to be up at 6:30.

18:30.729 --> 18:32.857
Duncan, you're like my mother.

18:32.940 --> 18:36.153
All you need is the fluffy
slippers and the hairnet.

18:37.780 --> 18:39.073
Good night.

18:51.716 --> 18:54.763
You came home late last night.

18:54.846 --> 18:57.642
I went for a walk.
Up to the village.

18:59.853 --> 19:01.146
The village?

19:03.358 --> 19:05.236
You know, if you'd
wanted to talk to Katrina,

19:05.319 --> 19:07.447
you could have
done it at supper.

19:07.531 --> 19:09.951
With a knife in my hand?
Bad idea.

19:10.993 --> 19:12.120
Hmm.

19:17.670 --> 19:19.881
So, did you sort things out?

19:19.965 --> 19:23.469
Oh, yeah, we're all
gonna become Mormons.

19:23.553 --> 19:26.431
Then you can have as
many wives as you like.

19:28.309 --> 19:29.979
You know,
Lex, there's nothing going on

19:30.062 --> 19:31.647
between me and
Katrina any more.

19:31.730 --> 19:33.483
What do I have to do
to persuade you of that?

19:33.567 --> 19:35.236
Simple.

19:35.319 --> 19:36.487
Send her back.

19:36.571 --> 19:38.031
Send her...

19:38.115 --> 19:40.535
I'm the Laird of Glenbogle,
not the tsar of
all the Russias.

19:40.618 --> 19:42.037
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

19:42.121 --> 19:45.000
Sorry,
Irene said you were here.
Is this a good time?

19:45.083 --> 19:47.044
-No.
-Yeah.

19:47.128 --> 19:48.212
No.

19:48.296 --> 19:49.798
Yes, yes, of course.

19:49.882 --> 19:52.343
Well,
it's about the teaching post.

19:52.427 --> 19:55.389
Basically the Board is
split down the middle.

19:55.472 --> 19:58.518
Three of us want
Katrina Finlay.

19:58.602 --> 19:59.854
And the other three?

19:59.937 --> 20:02.399
They have some doubts
about her commitment.

20:02.482 --> 20:04.276
Which means...

20:05.236 --> 20:06.863
It's down to me.

20:06.946 --> 20:08.407
Have you made
your decision yet?

20:12.580 --> 20:15.209
It's about what's
best for the school, Lex.

20:16.376 --> 20:17.879
Course it is.

20:18.630 --> 20:20.174
Excuse me.

20:22.302 --> 20:24.972
We'll need to know
by tomorrow morning.

20:26.224 --> 20:27.768
Yeah, you will.

20:38.074 --> 20:40.494
Are you spying on me?

20:40.577 --> 20:42.997
Just posting some letters.

20:43.081 --> 20:44.415
You going out?

20:44.499 --> 20:46.752
I was just gonna take
a look around the village.

20:46.835 --> 20:49.256
I'd forgotten how
much I miss this place.

20:49.339 --> 20:50.550
Well, if you come back...

20:50.633 --> 20:52.719
And am I? Coming back?

20:55.306 --> 20:58.310
The Board of
Governors likes you.

20:58.394 --> 21:00.397
Well, half of them.

21:00.480 --> 21:03.568
The other half
doubt your commitment.

21:04.945 --> 21:06.405
And what about you?

21:06.488 --> 21:08.700
Well,
you're a wonderful teacher

21:08.783 --> 21:10.828
but are you really
here for the job?

21:13.123 --> 21:15.668
Well, I was.

21:15.751 --> 21:18.547
At least I was when I
applied for the job,

21:18.630 --> 21:21.050
then I saw you
at the interview

21:21.134 --> 21:23.387
and I realised I'd
been kidding myself.

21:25.724 --> 21:27.560
I love you, Archie.

21:28.477 --> 21:31.273
I never stopped loving you.

21:31.356 --> 21:36.155
I can't believe we
threw away what we had.
And I don't believe it's over.

21:37.616 --> 21:41.162
I know you feel the same,
admit it.

21:41.245 --> 21:42.789
No, Katrina.

21:43.790 --> 21:47.004
Then tell me you don't.

21:47.087 --> 21:50.300
Lexie doesn't trust you,
she says you're playing games.

21:50.383 --> 21:51.509
Please, I'm gonna marry Lexie.

21:51.593 --> 21:52.678
When?

21:52.762 --> 21:55.182
How do you know
she'll even turn up?

21:55.265 --> 21:57.560
When has she ever
shown her full commitment?

21:58.770 --> 22:01.983
I would. I have.

22:02.067 --> 22:04.695
I'd give up everything.

22:04.779 --> 22:06.656
All you have to do is ask.

22:07.824 --> 22:09.159
Katrina, you left.

22:09.242 --> 22:11.621
We all make mistakes, Archie.

22:11.704 --> 22:14.250
It's not too late to fix it.

22:16.002 --> 22:19.298
Oh, please, this isn't fair,
not on any of us.

22:45.085 --> 22:46.837
What's the matter?

22:49.508 --> 22:51.927
You used to
fancy me, didn't you?

22:52.012 --> 22:54.306
Is this a trick question?

22:54.389 --> 22:57.769
Would you still have
me if I left Archie?

22:59.606 --> 23:01.649
If you left...

23:01.733 --> 23:03.777
What are you talking about?

23:03.861 --> 23:10.203
Well, now that Katrina's here,
it's like he's selling
himself short by marrying me.

23:10.287 --> 23:11.622
Oh!

23:12.999 --> 23:15.169
Don't talk rubbish, woman.

23:17.005 --> 23:18.340
Of course I...

23:18.423 --> 23:21.719
I still do fancy you
and the Lexie I fancied

23:21.802 --> 23:23.388
wouldn't give up
without a fight.

23:25.475 --> 23:28.062
What do you want me
and Katrina to do?

23:28.145 --> 23:30.565
Strip to
the waist and slug it out?

23:33.194 --> 23:35.113
No.

23:35.197 --> 23:39.536
And listen, Katrina's
not your problem, you are.

23:39.620 --> 23:43.750
You're still wearing
the rubber gloves in here.
You're not a housekeeper.

23:45.878 --> 23:47.214
You're Lexie.

23:48.590 --> 23:50.551
Queen of Glenbogle.

23:50.635 --> 23:54.516
And Archie loves
you and you deserve it
and you deserve him.

24:00.273 --> 24:04.112
If you're chasing women,
you'll need
a bigger net than that.

24:07.200 --> 24:09.119
My money's on you.

24:13.625 --> 24:16.296
No contest.

24:16.379 --> 24:22.138
And, Lexie, if you do go for
the topless,
bare knuckle thing,

24:23.264 --> 24:25.350
don't start
without us, will you?

24:35.906 --> 24:40.246
I had a daughter,
but I never knew what
that meant until I met her.

24:41.957 --> 24:45.128
Well,
I'm making up for lost time.

24:45.211 --> 24:47.840
What about yourself?

24:47.923 --> 24:49.383
What about me?

24:49.468 --> 24:51.720
You must have a family.

24:51.803 --> 24:53.890
Unless you rose up out
of the sea like that...

24:53.973 --> 24:55.976
What's her name?
Venus, in the painting.

24:56.060 --> 24:58.772
I did actually.
It was freezing.

25:00.232 --> 25:01.275
BOY: No way!

25:01.359 --> 25:02.444
Excuse me.

25:02.527 --> 25:04.029
We're trying to
have a conversation,

25:04.112 --> 25:06.074
could you just
lower your voice?

25:06.157 --> 25:09.496
All right, grandad.
If he takes his teeth out,
I'm really in trouble, eh?

25:09.579 --> 25:11.498
(LAUGHING) Anyway, so...

25:11.581 --> 25:12.833
Shall we go?

25:14.210 --> 25:16.880
So, where do you fancy?

25:16.964 --> 25:18.925
How about the seaside?

25:19.008 --> 25:20.094
The seaside?

25:20.177 --> 25:21.261
Hmm.

25:21.345 --> 25:22.472
Excellent idea.

25:22.555 --> 25:25.518
Good.

25:25.601 --> 25:29.064
Look. I thought
he'd have one of those
wee electric wheel chairs.

25:29.147 --> 25:32.403
You just be careful you
don't get your hands dirty
pushing that heap home.

25:32.486 --> 25:35.782
This is a turbo
charged XR3i, pal.

25:35.865 --> 25:38.202
Son,
you can't even spell XR3i.

25:38.285 --> 25:42.375
I'll be 30 miles down the road
while you're still looking
for your starting handle.

25:42.458 --> 25:43.584
Fancy a wee bet?

25:43.668 --> 25:44.712
Golly, let's just go.

25:44.795 --> 25:47.132
Aye. Ten quid
against your bus pass.

25:47.215 --> 25:49.635
No,
winner takes the keys, son.

25:49.719 --> 25:52.097
No way. If I need a skip,
I'll hire one.

25:52.180 --> 25:55.226
Go on, it's worth a few grand.

25:55.309 --> 25:59.148
Enough anyway to get somebody
to sort your acne out for you.

26:01.735 --> 26:03.571
First one to
the speed limit sign.

26:03.654 --> 26:04.656
Fine.

26:14.795 --> 26:19.176
Golly, this is insane.
I don't want to
end up walking home.

26:19.259 --> 26:21.471
Come on, Irene, get in.

26:21.554 --> 26:25.769
You need a good-looking woman
in the passenger seat
for this sort of thing.

26:31.443 --> 26:35.616
Look, you can't do this.
It's not only dangerous,
it's stupid and illegal.

26:35.699 --> 26:39.705
Aye, but the police
aren't gonna catch me,
are they?

26:39.789 --> 26:40.956
Look,
what are you trying to prove,

26:41.040 --> 26:42.918
that you're just
as daft as he is?

26:43.001 --> 26:47.716
Look, missus, tell
your dad to get in his car
'cause I've got places to be.

26:47.800 --> 26:50.678
Oh, do him a favour,
don't you ride with him.

26:50.762 --> 26:53.599
All that extra
weight won't help.

26:53.682 --> 26:57.146
You mind you
don't wrap yourself
round a lamppost, eh?

27:02.654 --> 27:06.659
Pimply little maggot.
Just make sure you burn him.

27:06.742 --> 27:08.745
-Right, after three.
-Okay.

27:08.829 --> 27:11.124
One, two, three.

27:48.885 --> 27:50.554
The keys.

27:54.184 --> 27:56.312
If you can find them,
you can keep them.

27:59.484 --> 28:01.736
Have a nice day.

28:01.819 --> 28:03.614
What are you
standing there for?

28:06.994 --> 28:09.372
I can't believe your luck.

28:09.456 --> 28:11.708
That's very shrewd of you.

28:18.134 --> 28:21.932
Age and treachery
will always triumph
over youth and horsepower.

28:42.627 --> 28:45.423
What are all these?

28:45.506 --> 28:47.926
Last minute
arrangements for the wedding.

28:48.009 --> 28:50.388
I was supposed to
confirm days ago.

28:50.471 --> 28:54.477
Well, you'd better
hurry up then, hadn't you?

28:54.561 --> 28:58.315
So, you're up for it are you,
marching bands and all?

28:58.399 --> 28:59.693
Of course.

28:59.776 --> 29:00.986
Why?

29:03.531 --> 29:05.409
What do you mean, why?

29:05.492 --> 29:07.996
I want whatever
makes you happy.

29:09.874 --> 29:12.377
I don't know what
I want any more.

29:15.965 --> 29:17.718
Or who you want you mean.

29:17.801 --> 29:19.471
That's not what I meant.

29:19.554 --> 29:23.476
What did she say, then?
Katrina.

29:23.559 --> 29:24.728
Katrina?

29:26.146 --> 29:28.649
(SIGHS)

29:28.733 --> 29:33.823
Katrina said that you
don't trust me any more.
Is that true?

29:37.412 --> 29:41.292
Because if it is, Lexie,
why would you
want to marry me?

29:41.375 --> 29:43.003
If it's just so that you
can keep me on a leash,

29:43.086 --> 29:46.216
then it's not
gonna work, is it?

29:47.426 --> 29:49.679
No.

29:49.763 --> 29:53.976
But let's face it, it was
never gonna work, was it?

30:29.944 --> 30:31.571
(SCREAMING)

30:46.758 --> 30:48.428
(BIRD CAWING)

30:51.098 --> 30:54.060
Okay, birdie, back off.

30:54.144 --> 30:55.730
Drop it. Leave it.

30:56.982 --> 30:59.569
Shoo. Hey, that's not fair!

31:02.823 --> 31:05.410
No, that's not fair!

31:17.093 --> 31:18.261
(SQUAWKS)

31:50.390 --> 31:52.601
I don't suppose it's
easy being the laird.

31:52.685 --> 31:56.606
Thousands of acres,
hundreds of tenants,
dozens of staff.

31:56.690 --> 31:58.276
Well, us three.

31:58.359 --> 31:59.862
That lot I can manage.

32:01.572 --> 32:03.867
That woman who came
to dinner last night.

32:03.950 --> 32:06.997
She wasn't just
the village teacher, was she?

32:07.080 --> 32:08.623
Was it that obvious?

32:08.707 --> 32:11.920
She hardly touched her food
and it wasn't my cooking.

32:13.297 --> 32:16.467
(SIGHING) Why didn't I
just listen to Lexie?

32:16.551 --> 32:20.891
Nice simple service,
sign here, she'll do for me,
everyone off to the pub.

32:20.974 --> 32:23.644
That wouldn't have
changed anything.

32:23.728 --> 32:26.648
It's not the ceremony,
it's what it means.

32:29.445 --> 32:32.699
Katrina used to
be the world to me.

32:32.782 --> 32:37.289
And then Lexie was. Is.

32:37.372 --> 32:42.296
And now between love and duty,
loyalty and friendship,
I don't know what to do.

32:44.089 --> 32:46.969
Whatever you do
will hurt someone.

32:47.053 --> 32:50.390
Yeah, but doing
nothing will hurt everyone.

32:50.474 --> 32:53.269
Maybe you should
just do the right thing.

32:59.320 --> 33:00.947
Morning, Duncan.

33:02.741 --> 33:03.825
So how was your evening?

33:03.909 --> 33:05.495
Oh, fantastic.

33:05.578 --> 33:09.209
Golly got into
a rumble with some punk
in a hot hatch.

33:09.292 --> 33:10.877
It was like Rebel
Without A Cause.

33:10.961 --> 33:12.421
That's nice.

33:14.591 --> 33:16.635
So you'll be heading
out again this evening?

33:16.719 --> 33:18.638
Well, we...

33:18.721 --> 33:19.765
Do you want to join us?

33:19.849 --> 33:22.477
What, stuffed in the boot?
No thanks.

33:22.561 --> 33:25.982
I think I'll just head up
to the village on my bike.
Fancy a ride on the crossbar?

33:26.065 --> 33:29.863
Duncan, Golly and I, we're
just having a bit of fun.

33:29.946 --> 33:33.576
Oh, right,
and have you told him that?

33:33.659 --> 33:35.036
(MUMBLING)

33:35.120 --> 33:36.246
Oh, Eileen, is it?

33:36.329 --> 33:38.374
Irene.

33:38.457 --> 33:42.505
Oh, well, whatever.
Just caught this in that
big puddle out the front.

33:42.589 --> 33:45.509
Congratulations.
You want it stuffed?

33:45.593 --> 33:51.392
Capital idea, yes,
with almonds and coriander,
if you know what that is.

33:51.475 --> 33:54.564
Well done, please.

33:54.647 --> 33:56.399
I'm not into sushi.

33:59.487 --> 34:03.075
Almonds and coriander.
Strychnine more like.

34:04.244 --> 34:06.580
Here, I'll do this.

34:09.083 --> 34:11.170
We didn't...

34:11.253 --> 34:14.217
I didn't mean to
make you feel left out.

34:14.300 --> 34:16.969
Och, don't be daft.

34:17.054 --> 34:19.056
It's just my luck.

34:19.139 --> 34:21.768
I mean, I meet
someone that I really like

34:21.851 --> 34:24.606
and I fix them up
with somebody else
that I really like,

34:24.688 --> 34:27.443
and they go out and
have a really good time,

34:27.525 --> 34:31.489
and I lose 2,000
quid's worth of gadget
in the loch.

34:31.572 --> 34:36.038
My typical,
rotten, lousy, useless...

34:41.880 --> 34:44.217
Looks like your
luck's changed.

34:49.683 --> 34:51.059
Archie.

34:51.141 --> 34:53.187
Oh, Lex, I've gotta go.
The Board meets in 10 minutes.

34:53.271 --> 34:57.777
No, there's something that
I wanted to say
to you last night.

34:57.860 --> 35:02.742
Look, I'm sorry
that I've given
you such a hard time.

35:02.826 --> 35:05.997
I love you and I
don't want to lose you.

35:07.165 --> 35:09.544
Let her go, Archie.

35:09.627 --> 35:11.797
What, and deny
the school the best teacher

35:11.880 --> 35:13.924
they could have just
because we've got problems?

35:14.008 --> 35:15.969
I know I'm being paranoid

35:16.052 --> 35:20.809
but as long as she's around,
I'm always gonna
feel like second best.

35:20.892 --> 35:23.855
Okay, so I send her
away and what will you do

35:23.938 --> 35:26.066
the next time
an old flame pops up?

35:29.196 --> 35:31.783
She's not just an old flame,
though, is she?

35:34.162 --> 35:37.041
Lex, you have to trust me.

35:38.709 --> 35:43.506
Let her go and I promise
I'll trust you forever.

35:53.813 --> 35:55.650
I'll see you later, okay.

36:04.704 --> 36:06.749
-Aye, aye.
-IRENE: Hiya.

36:06.832 --> 36:09.419
I'm thinking of
giving her a respray.

36:09.502 --> 36:13.674
Something classy
and understated
like scarlet or lime green.

36:13.757 --> 36:15.594
What do you think?

36:15.678 --> 36:18.306
I think it's not
the bodywork that counts,
it's what's under the bonnet.

36:18.389 --> 36:20.976
Oh, yes. Yes, yes.

36:21.059 --> 36:26.442
Thought maybe we
could take a drive
up to Plockton, Applecross.

36:26.526 --> 36:30.156
You know, drive up,
stay over somewhere.

36:30.240 --> 36:34.454
Would you mind if we eased off
on the accelerator a bit?

36:34.538 --> 36:37.709
No, no, no, not at all.

36:37.792 --> 36:40.921
I suppose she does
have some miles on her,
doesn't she?

36:41.005 --> 36:45.011
No,
Golly, she has loads of style
and she's a lovely mover.

36:45.094 --> 36:46.680
It's just the speed,
my head's starting to spin.

36:48.849 --> 36:51.352
Well, do you fancy
a walk sometime, then?

36:51.436 --> 36:53.105
Yeah, sometime.

37:40.046 --> 37:41.757
I take it you voted for me.

37:41.840 --> 37:43.425
Of course.

37:44.427 --> 37:45.595
Well, thanks for that.

37:45.679 --> 37:48.766
Oh, please,
we're lucky to have you.

37:48.849 --> 37:50.644
I can't stay at
the B&amp;B forever

37:50.727 --> 37:53.773
so I was thinking
maybe I could
have my cottage back.

37:53.856 --> 37:55.526
Maybe you could come
to the house warming.

37:55.609 --> 37:57.153
I'd love to.

37:57.237 --> 38:00.282
I can't, I'm sorry.

38:00.366 --> 38:03.870
You afraid people
might get the wrong idea?

38:03.954 --> 38:07.251
I'm afraid you might
get the wrong idea.

38:07.334 --> 38:10.380
Katrina, Lexie and I
are going to be married.

38:11.757 --> 38:13.759
What you and I had
was wonderful, but...

38:13.843 --> 38:15.721
But note the past tense.

38:16.848 --> 38:18.474
I knew it.

38:19.476 --> 38:22.147
I knew I shouldn't but...

38:22.230 --> 38:24.859
I just kept
thinking maybe this once

38:24.942 --> 38:27.446
I could turn
the clock back, you know.

38:29.240 --> 38:31.534
What an idiot.

38:31.618 --> 38:32.745
Well, I'm sorry if I...

38:32.828 --> 38:35.290
No, no, Archie, don't.

38:35.373 --> 38:37.710
It's not your fault.

38:37.793 --> 38:43.217
The advert didn't say
salary according to scale
and old boyfriend included.

38:43.301 --> 38:45.721
You'll find someone else.

38:45.804 --> 38:48.850
Do you know how long
it took me to find you?

38:51.520 --> 38:52.773
I love...

38:54.359 --> 38:58.280
I love it here.
I love teaching.

38:59.532 --> 39:01.661
And I really
want to come back.

39:03.329 --> 39:08.336
But if that means seeing
you and Lexie every day,

39:08.419 --> 39:12.384
knowing that
she's got something
that I'll never have,

39:12.467 --> 39:13.718
I can't.

39:15.554 --> 39:18.058
I just can't do it.

39:18.141 --> 39:19.560
You don't mean...

39:19.644 --> 39:24.109
Thanks for job offer
but I won't be accepting.

39:30.075 --> 39:32.036
Oh, Archie, Archie.

39:46.849 --> 39:50.729
DUNCAN: Lexie!
Where are you going?

39:50.812 --> 39:53.357
Lexie, wait!

39:53.441 --> 39:54.776
You're not running off?

39:54.860 --> 39:57.071
No, I'm walking.

39:57.155 --> 39:59.283
Don't just give up.

39:59.366 --> 40:01.243
I told him I loved him
and it wasn't enough.

40:01.326 --> 40:03.121
I don't know
what else I can do.

40:03.204 --> 40:07.544
Try anything. Seduction,
blackmail, witchcraft.

40:07.627 --> 40:10.548
I wanted him to choose me.
He didn't.

40:10.631 --> 40:13.218
I blew it,
Dunc, I can't stay here.

40:13.302 --> 40:15.764
Lexie, hold on.

40:20.228 --> 40:23.024
Oh,
I can't believe you're going.

40:23.107 --> 40:24.985
(LEXIE SOBBING)

40:27.113 --> 40:29.200
Me neither.

40:29.283 --> 40:32.329
I'll call you at
your mum's, okay?

40:32.412 --> 40:35.291
Nice try, Dunc.

40:35.375 --> 40:38.295
Tell Archie not
to follow me, okay?

40:38.379 --> 40:42.885
Tell him... Tell him I'm
sorry I messed him around.

40:42.968 --> 40:46.766
Lexie, I'll never remember
all that. You tell him.

40:50.229 --> 40:51.689
Bye, Dunc.

41:05.542 --> 41:09.172
Ah,
Golly, where's this hot coupe
I've been hearing about?

41:09.256 --> 41:12.135
I rather fancied seeing
if I could
still leap into one.

41:12.218 --> 41:14.304
I'm afraid I got
rid of it, Molly.

41:14.388 --> 41:16.348
Oh, no, but why?

41:16.432 --> 41:18.309
A man my age,
an open-topped car,

41:18.393 --> 41:20.187
it's just a wee bit pathetic,
isn't it?

41:20.271 --> 41:21.773
Yes, I suppose so.

41:21.857 --> 41:23.734
There comes a time
when one has to settle

41:23.817 --> 41:25.653
for something
rather more sensible.

41:25.737 --> 41:29.409
Exactly, which is
why I got this instead.

41:31.912 --> 41:36.251
Twice the mpg, more reliable,
far cheaper to run.

41:36.334 --> 41:40.799
Of course, and so practical.
And quite nippy
I should think.

41:40.883 --> 41:42.260
Nought to 60 in 4.7 seconds.

41:42.343 --> 41:43.720
Oof.

41:43.803 --> 41:46.516
Near enough pull your arms out
of your sockets, Molly.

41:46.600 --> 41:49.896
Oh, look, you've got
a spare helmet, I see.

41:56.237 --> 41:59.326
Oh, hello.
I was looking for Lexie.

41:59.409 --> 42:02.330
Oh, what, the housekeeper?

42:02.413 --> 42:07.712
My employees always
settled for a pat on the tush
and a mink coat.

42:07.796 --> 42:11.008
I was never so
careless as to get engaged.

42:13.178 --> 42:16.600
For a counterjumper, Louis,
you're really quite a snob.

42:16.683 --> 42:20.772
Well, we all enjoy a little
fumble below the stairs,

42:20.855 --> 42:24.569
but a man of your position
really ought to marry money.

42:24.653 --> 42:28.992
Then you could hire
as many
housekeepers as you like.

42:29.076 --> 42:31.704
My father had a saying...

42:31.788 --> 42:35.000
fish and visitors go
off after two days.

42:35.084 --> 42:39.841
Your father, sayings
were about all he had.

42:39.924 --> 42:43.262
Right, pack your bags.
The last thing my mother needs

42:43.345 --> 42:46.349
is some clapped out Casanova
messing about
with her feelings.

42:46.433 --> 42:48.769
I'm not messing about,
old boy.

42:48.853 --> 42:51.064
My intentions are
strictly honourable.

42:51.148 --> 42:53.734
That's what's bothering
you really, isn't it?

42:53.818 --> 42:58.241
No more playing the laird
when I'm at
the head of the table.

42:58.324 --> 43:00.578
Well, clearly you
haven't done your homework.

43:00.661 --> 43:03.665
'Cause even if my mother
was desperate
enough to marry you,

43:03.749 --> 43:05.460
then I would
still be the laird

43:05.543 --> 43:07.129
and you would still be
Lord Louis of nowhere.

43:07.212 --> 43:08.547
Suits me!

43:08.630 --> 43:11.384
I don't want everyone
to know I'm marrying

43:11.469 --> 43:14.139
into a family as
dotty as the MacDonalds.

43:14.222 --> 43:16.391
Look, let's face it,
Hector didn't have

43:16.476 --> 43:18.603
many marbles to
pass on, did he?

43:18.686 --> 43:19.772
Louis!

43:19.855 --> 43:23.193
Oh, darling, darling, Molly.

43:23.276 --> 43:26.948
I didn't mean any
disrespect to Hector,

43:27.032 --> 43:31.872
just that I envied him,
snatching the most
beautiful girl in London

43:31.955 --> 43:34.167
from right under my nose.

43:34.250 --> 43:36.127
We'll have some fun.

43:36.211 --> 43:40.592
You can't pretend you like
being locked up in this...

43:40.675 --> 43:42.261
mausoleum.

43:42.345 --> 43:44.598
Okay, that's enough.

43:44.681 --> 43:47.352
We'll have some
laughs together.

43:47.435 --> 43:51.608
After all these years in exile
you deserve to be happy.

43:51.691 --> 43:55.905
Hector and I were happy.
Happier than a man like
you could ever imagine.

43:55.988 --> 43:57.699
But look what he left behind!

43:57.783 --> 44:01.329
A mountain of debt,
a monument to dry rot,

44:01.412 --> 44:04.084
and a huge smoking
hole in the ground...

44:05.293 --> 44:06.587
Ah! Ooh!

44:07.964 --> 44:09.550
(GRUNTS)

44:09.633 --> 44:12.345
(GRUNTING AND GROANING)

44:12.428 --> 44:13.471
Darling.

44:16.267 --> 44:19.188
Lex? Lexie?

44:28.784 --> 44:30.454
She's gone, Arch.

44:31.998 --> 44:35.544
-Gone? Gone where?
-Over the hills.

44:35.627 --> 44:39.592
No. No, no, no, no,
that wasn't meant to happen.

44:39.675 --> 44:41.511
-What,
you mean there was a plan?
-Yeah.

44:41.595 --> 44:44.098
-Why did you let her go, Dunc?
-I didn't let her go.

44:45.850 --> 44:47.019
No, you're right, I did.

44:48.938 --> 44:50.607
Oh, I've been such a fool!

44:52.401 --> 44:53.402
That's not what I mean.

45:43.430 --> 45:45.433
How did you find me?

45:45.517 --> 45:47.436
I followed my heart.

45:47.520 --> 45:50.524
Your heart? I thought
Katrina had run off with it.

45:50.607 --> 45:52.902
Ah, she was too late.

45:52.986 --> 45:55.823
The only thing I
could give Katrina
was a teaching job,

45:55.906 --> 45:58.953
and as it happened,
she didn't want it,
so she's left.

46:00.413 --> 46:03.625
You had to do it
your way, didn't you?

46:03.709 --> 46:06.254
I had to do the right thing.

46:08.382 --> 46:11.178
I want you to trust me.

46:11.261 --> 46:14.975
If I'd sent Katrina away,
all it would prove
is that you couldn't.

46:15.058 --> 46:17.645
Now come home, please.

46:17.729 --> 46:18.855
I won't marry you, Archie.

46:18.939 --> 46:19.982
Lexie...

46:20.065 --> 46:23.528
I can't. Not if it
involves marching bands

46:23.612 --> 46:27.993
and haggis flinging and
me flashing my garters
at the whole clan MacDonald.

46:28.076 --> 46:30.997
Don't tell me, you want
a quick little ceremony
miles from anywhere

46:31.080 --> 46:33.876
with all the usual
suspects as witnesses.

46:33.960 --> 46:36.171
Aye, I do.

46:37.548 --> 46:39.760
Fine. Have it your way.

46:42.680 --> 46:44.517
(CAR HONKING)

46:46.478 --> 46:48.480
Where did they come from?

46:50.525 --> 46:52.861
And who
the hell are those two?

46:57.326 --> 46:58.869
Thank you, Golly.

46:58.954 --> 47:00.372
My pleasure, Reverend.

47:00.455 --> 47:03.084
Oh, that was... Ooh!

47:03.167 --> 47:05.128
I don't believe it.

47:05.212 --> 47:07.090
Did somebody
call for a minister?

47:07.173 --> 47:10.052
I wonder if you'd
care to marry us?

47:10.135 --> 47:14.684
Right here, right now,
no skydiving bagpipers,
just this rabble.

47:14.767 --> 47:16.812
What about the clan and...

47:16.895 --> 47:18.814
They'll have their big day,
this one'll be ours.

47:18.898 --> 47:22.570
Well,
the paperwork's all sorted,

47:22.653 --> 47:24.990
but before we proceed,
we have to have

47:25.073 --> 47:27.285
the consent of the bride,
fully and freely given.

47:29.246 --> 47:31.499
Do you want to do this, Lexie?

47:34.712 --> 47:39.135
Yeah.
Yeah, I do, very much so.

47:41.012 --> 47:42.514
Gather round.

47:42.598 --> 47:44.475
No, no, wait.
We've not run over the vows

47:44.559 --> 47:46.352
or rehearsed
the service or anything.

47:46.437 --> 47:49.024
We'll just make
it up as we go.

47:50.859 --> 47:52.695
Join hands now.

47:55.532 --> 48:02.125
To seal your vows in
the presence of God
and your family and friends.

48:07.299 --> 48:10.261
Lexie, please be my wife.

48:11.889 --> 48:13.349
My friend.

48:15.101 --> 48:18.481
Everything you see from
this mountain is mine.

48:20.025 --> 48:22.987
And I give it all to you.

48:23.071 --> 48:27.911
Be my only love
and stay with me.

48:27.994 --> 48:34.837
And I swear I will be faithful
and cherish you until
the last beat of my heart.

48:38.592 --> 48:43.516
Archie, I don't have
anything to give you
except my heart,

48:44.893 --> 48:47.021
my soul and my life.

48:49.942 --> 48:55.408
You be my husband
and I'll trust you
and I'll cherish you

48:56.535 --> 49:00.623
until the last
breath leaves my body.

49:02.042 --> 49:04.796
Do you take Lexie
as your wife, Archie?

49:06.131 --> 49:07.883
I do.

49:07.967 --> 49:11.179
Lexie, do you take
Archie as your husband?

49:12.557 --> 49:14.059
I do.

49:14.143 --> 49:17.981
Then, by the grace of God,

49:18.064 --> 49:20.693
you're husband and wife.

49:42.933 --> 49:44.977
Oh, Archie, put me down.

49:45.061 --> 49:46.605
Come on, our turn.

49:46.688 --> 49:48.190
No, no, really,
I need my toes for counting.

49:48.273 --> 49:52.071
Oh, don't be silly, look,
sword dancing for beginners.

49:54.991 --> 49:57.119
-All right?
-I wish your father was here.

49:58.830 --> 50:00.374
Yeah, me, too.

50:00.457 --> 50:03.461
He would have been so proud
to see you happy at last.

50:04.964 --> 50:07.092
You made
the right choice, Archie.

50:07.175 --> 50:09.178
Be good to her
and to yourself.

50:16.855 --> 50:21.111
So how did you find me, then?
You can't even find
your shoes in the morning.

50:21.194 --> 50:24.658
Well, I told you,
I followed my heart.

50:24.741 --> 50:29.581
Hey, Arch, we'll be
able to give these guys
a real testimonial now, eh?

50:29.665 --> 50:33.378
Is that a tracking device?

50:33.461 --> 50:36.383
I thought you said that
you followed your heart?

50:36.466 --> 50:39.679
Well, yeah, yeah,
Duncan bugged your rucksack

50:39.762 --> 50:41.180
and my heart told
me to follow it.

50:41.264 --> 50:42.766
Oh, really?

50:44.394 --> 50:47.356
You know what we need now?
Fireworks.

50:47.440 --> 50:48.859
-Ah, yeah.
-Brilliant idea.

50:48.942 --> 50:52.822
Duncan,
did you bring any fireworks?

50:52.905 --> 50:57.454
It's all right, Hector
sent some fireworks. Look.

51:01.710 --> 51:03.462
My goodness!

51:04.631 --> 51:07.009
Look at that, Lex.

51:07.092 --> 51:09.763
You could make
a million wishes.

51:09.846 --> 51:12.266
Do you know what, Arch?

51:12.350 --> 51:14.603
I don't have any
more wishes left.
