00:22.800 --> 00:24.500
AN INTERESTING THING
HAPPENED

00:24.500 --> 00:26.600
WHEN I WAS GRADING YOUR
ASSIGNMENT, MR. HUNTER.

00:26.600 --> 00:28.233
YOURS WASN'T THERE.

00:28.233 --> 00:30.300
OH, I--I CAN EXPLAIN THAT.

00:30.300 --> 00:31.467
I WAS SPEAKING
TO MR. HUNTER.

00:31.467 --> 00:33.967
WELL, SEE, SHAWN AND I,
WE THINK SO MUCH ALIKE

00:33.967 --> 00:36.200
THAT WE DECIDED TO WRITE
ONE PAPER.

00:36.200 --> 00:38.300
REALLY?
YEAH.

00:38.300 --> 00:39.900
THEN YOU WON'T MIND
SHARING YOUR GRADE.

00:39.900 --> 00:41.600
ALL RIGHT.
SO WHAT DO WE GET?

00:41.600 --> 00:44.100
WELL, THIS WAS A WELL
THOUGHT OUT PAPER.

00:44.100 --> 00:45.100
IT DESERVES A "B."

00:45.100 --> 00:46.400
VERY FAIR.

00:46.400 --> 00:47.800
DIVIDED BY 2...

00:47.800 --> 00:51.133
MAKES A "D" FOR YOU
AND A "D" FOR YOU.

00:51.133 --> 00:52.300
HEY!

00:52.300 --> 00:53.967
STILL FAIR. STILL GOOD.

00:53.967 --> 00:55.600
BUT MR. FEENY. COME ON.

00:55.600 --> 00:57.467
IT'S THE MIDDLE
OF OUR SENIOR YEAR.

00:57.467 --> 00:59.100
WHY ARE YOU
BEING SO TOUGH ON US

00:59.100 --> 01:00.467
WITH THESE ASSIGNMENTS?

01:00.467 --> 01:01.867
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE RIGHT.

01:01.867 --> 01:04.900
LET'S FORGET ABOUT THOSE Ds.
MAKE IT 2 Fs.

01:04.900 --> 01:06.767
NO! DON'T FAIL THEM.

01:06.767 --> 01:10.033
AH, THE THIRD
MUSKETEER CHIMES IN.

01:10.033 --> 01:12.867
AN "F" FOLLOWS YOU AROUND
FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE.

01:12.867 --> 01:15.100
OK. WE'LL TAKE YOUR Ds.

01:15.100 --> 01:17.700
OUR COLLEGE APPLICATIONS
ARE ALREADY IN.

01:17.700 --> 01:19.300
YEAH, WELL, YOURS ARE.

01:19.300 --> 01:21.834
WHAT? YOU HAVEN'T SENT
YOUR COLLEGE APPLICATIONS IN.

01:21.834 --> 01:23.700
SHAWN, I FILLED THEM OUT
FOR YOU.

01:23.700 --> 01:25.667
CORY, DON'T START, OK?
WHAT'S THE POINT?

01:25.667 --> 01:27.667
PEOPLE LIKE ME
DON'T GO TO COLLEGE.

01:27.667 --> 01:29.100
DO YOUR ASSIGNMENTS,
MR. HUNTER,

01:29.100 --> 01:30.367
AND YOU'LL
GO TO COLLEGE.

01:30.367 --> 01:32.767
AND IF I GET IN, HOW AM I
SUPPOSED TO AFFORD IT, HUH?

01:32.767 --> 01:35.900
THERE'S--THERE'S JUST SO MANY
THINGS STANDING IN THE WAY.

01:35.900 --> 01:39.100
BESIDES, I MEAN, WHY ARE WE
DOING ALL THESE ASSIGNMENTS?

01:39.100 --> 01:41.500
THEY'RE JUST BUSY WORK.
WHAT'S LEFT TO LEARN?

01:43.900 --> 01:47.600
UH, MR. FEENY,
HE JUST MEANS THAT, UH,

01:47.600 --> 01:50.200
WE-WE'VE BEEN HERE
4 YEARS, AND THERE'S

01:50.200 --> 01:52.467
NOTHING REALLY LEFT
THAT YOU CAN TEACH US.

01:54.300 --> 01:56.400
WHOA. LOOK AT FEENY, MAN.

01:56.400 --> 01:57.367
FEENY, YOU OK?

01:58.734 --> 01:59.800
[WHISPERING] Shawn!

01:59.800 --> 02:01.900
This is that moment
that we talked about.

02:01.900 --> 02:05.100
YEAH, HE'S DEFINITELY
GONNA BLOW.

02:05.100 --> 02:06.400
STAND UP.

02:06.400 --> 02:08.500
OK. THIS IS BAD.

02:08.500 --> 02:09.834
THE REST OF THE CLASS,
PLEASE LEAVE.

02:09.834 --> 02:11.400
BAD, BAD.

02:11.400 --> 02:15.500
GOOD-BYE. GOOD-BYE.

02:15.500 --> 02:18.100
MR. FEENY, WHY DON'T
YOU JUST GIVE THEM
A MAKEUP ASSIGNMENT?

02:18.100 --> 02:19.367
DON'T FAIL THEM.

02:19.367 --> 02:21.233
YOU'D BETTER STAY, TOO,
YOU LITTLE CONTROL FREAK.

02:22.867 --> 02:25.834
SO, JUST BECAUSE YOU SENT IN
YOUR COLLEGE APPLICATIONS,

02:25.834 --> 02:30.667
NOTHING THAT
I TEACH YOU FROM NOW ON
MEANS ANYTHING, HMM?

02:30.667 --> 02:32.767
I WAS JUST HAVING
THIS DISCUSSION WITH THEM
THE OTHER DAY.

02:32.767 --> 02:34.000
QUIET!

02:34.000 --> 02:35.667
YOU YELLED AT ME.

02:35.667 --> 02:38.200
BUT I'M TOPANGA.

02:38.200 --> 02:40.934
SHAWN,
I WANT THIS ASSIGNMENT

02:40.934 --> 02:43.500
BROUGHT TO MY HOUSE
BY 5:00 THIS AFTERNOON.

02:43.500 --> 02:45.133
THIS AFTERNOON TODAY?

02:45.133 --> 02:46.200
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

02:47.667 --> 02:48.867
Cory: OH, NO.

02:48.867 --> 02:50.734
HE'S KEYED INTO
SOMETHING YOU SAID.

02:50.734 --> 02:52.000
THIS AFTERNOON TODAY?!

02:52.000 --> 02:53.100
WHY DOESN'T
HE JUST ASK ME

02:53.100 --> 02:55.600
TO COME UP WITH TICKETS
TO THE SUPER BOWL?

02:55.600 --> 02:57.934
MR. HUNTER,
HERE'S YOUR NEW ASSIGNMENT--

02:57.934 --> 03:01.000
TO COME UP WITH 2 TICKETS
TO THE SUPER BOWL

03:01.000 --> 03:02.200
BY THE END OF THE WEEK.

03:02.200 --> 03:04.000
OH, COME ON, MR. FEENY--

03:04.000 --> 03:05.400
QUIET!

03:05.400 --> 03:07.567
YOU YELLED AT ME.

03:07.567 --> 03:09.200
BUT I'M TOPANGA.

03:11.300 --> 03:13.767
MR. FEENY, WHAT ARE YOU
SO UPSET ABOUT?

03:13.767 --> 03:16.100
MS. LAWRENCE,
I HAVE AN ASSIGNMENT
FOR YOU AS WELL.

03:16.100 --> 03:20.000
BUTT OUT OF OTHER
PEOPLE'S LIVES
FOR ONE WEEK.

03:20.000 --> 03:22.200
OTHERWISE,
YOU GET AN "F."

03:22.200 --> 03:24.900
BUT I'VE NEVER
FAILED BEFORE.

03:24.900 --> 03:26.934
THERE'S A FIRST TIME
FOR EVERYTHING.

03:26.934 --> 03:29.934
THAT ARGUMENT DOESN'T
GET YOU ANYWHERE WITH HER.

03:32.467 --> 03:34.367
AND AS FOR YOU,
MR. MATTHEWS,

03:34.367 --> 03:37.000
SINCE YOU FEEL
SO RESPONSIBLE FOR
YOUR FRIENDS' FATE,

03:37.000 --> 03:39.500
I PUT THEIR FATE
IN YOUR HANDS.

03:39.500 --> 03:42.033
THEIR SUCCESS
IS YOUR SUCCESS.

03:42.033 --> 03:44.767
BUT IF EITHER
OF THEM FAILS,
SO DO YOU.

03:47.500 --> 03:49.600
THANKS A LOT, TOPANGA.

03:54.367 --> 03:56.200
HEY. DIDN'T HEAR YA
COME IN LAST NIGHT.

03:56.200 --> 03:57.800
MUST HAVE HAD
A PRETTY GOOD TIME
WITH YOUR DATE, HUH?

03:57.800 --> 03:59.867
THE EVENING
BEGAN AT 7:00.

03:59.867 --> 04:02.567
IT STARTED
WITH SOME INTIMATE
PRE-DINNER CONVERSATION

04:02.567 --> 04:04.767
AT A QUAINT
LITTLE MEXICAN PLACE
I HAPPEN TO KNOW.

04:04.767 --> 04:06.500
CAME BACK HERE AND...

04:06.500 --> 04:09.000
LET'S JUST SAY
MY CLOTHES WERE OFF
WITHIN 5 MINUTES.

04:11.500 --> 04:13.734
YOU OPENED YOUR BIG MOUTH.
SHE WALKED OUT.

04:13.734 --> 04:14.900
YOU ATE ALONE
AT TACO BELL,

04:14.900 --> 04:16.600
CAME HOME, TOOK OFF
ALL YOUR CLOTHES,

04:16.600 --> 04:19.100
AND WERE ASLEEP BY 8:00.

04:19.100 --> 04:21.500
HOW'D YOU DO?

04:21.500 --> 04:23.400
NOT AS GOOD.

04:23.400 --> 04:25.200
JACK,
WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?!

04:25.200 --> 04:27.500
I DON'T KNOW.
IT'S NOT US.

04:27.500 --> 04:30.200
NO, IT IS NOT US.
YOU KNOW WHO IT IS?

04:30.200 --> 04:31.667
THEM.

04:31.667 --> 04:32.767
ALL OF 'EM.

04:34.467 --> 04:35.734
WE NEED
TO MAKE A CHANGE.

04:35.734 --> 04:37.300
YEAH. IT'S TIME
TO BE MORE CHOOSY,
MY FRIEND,

04:37.300 --> 04:38.734
FIND WOMEN WHO ARE
MORE COMPATIBLE.

04:38.734 --> 04:40.133
YOU KNOW SOMETHING?
YOU'RE RIGHT.

04:40.133 --> 04:41.700
NO MORE RANDOMLY
JUST PICKING OUT WOMEN,

04:41.700 --> 04:43.200
HOPING THAT
THEY LIKE US.

04:43.200 --> 04:47.100
I SAY WE EMBARK
UPON A MISSION TO FIND
OUR PERFECT COMPANIONS,

04:47.100 --> 04:49.400
OUR--OUR SOUL MATES.

04:49.400 --> 04:51.300
WHAT ABOUT THEM?

04:51.300 --> 04:53.467
HEY, YOU TWO!

04:53.467 --> 04:55.100
NO, NOT--

04:55.100 --> 04:57.000
YEAH, OK, YOU!

05:00.667 --> 05:02.934
Radio deejay: TODAY'S FORECAST
IS CHILLY IN PHILLY

05:02.934 --> 05:05.467
AS THE RECORD-BREAKING
COLD SNAP CONTINUES.

05:05.467 --> 05:07.400
OK. WHAT DO YOU GOT?

05:07.400 --> 05:10.500
I GOT 4 CAN'T-MISS WAYS
ON HOW TO GET
SUPER BOWL TICKETS.

05:10.500 --> 05:11.834
OK. GIVE ME
THE BEST ONE.

05:11.834 --> 05:14.233
I GO BACK IN TIME
TO THE FIRST SUPER BOWL

05:14.233 --> 05:15.934
WHEN TICKETS
WEREN'T THAT HARD TO GET.

05:17.600 --> 05:19.100
GOOD. GOOD.

05:19.100 --> 05:20.500
VERY GOOD.

05:20.500 --> 05:22.967
I DON'T NEED TO HEAR
THE OTHER 3.

05:22.967 --> 05:25.000
IF YOU'RE GONNA
GO BACK IN TIME,

05:25.000 --> 05:26.867
YOU COULD DO
THE ORIGINAL ASSIGNMENT,

05:26.867 --> 05:29.000
AND WE WOULDN'T
BE IN THIS MESS--

05:29.000 --> 05:32.300
♪ TRA-LA LA-LA LA-LA-LA ♪

05:32.300 --> 05:35.834
TOPANGA, BUTTING IN
IN MUSICAL FORM
IS STILL BUTTING IN.

05:35.834 --> 05:38.567
OH, OH, ASK TOPANGA.
THAT WAS MY NEXT IDEA.

05:38.567 --> 05:39.900
WE GET ADVICE
FROM TOPANGA.

05:39.900 --> 05:41.100
IF I GIVE ADVICE,
I GET AN "F."

05:41.100 --> 05:43.300
OH, YOU CAN AFFORD
ONE STINKING "F"
IN YOUR LIFE.

05:43.300 --> 05:44.867
NO! I CAN'T!

05:44.867 --> 05:46.400
I'VE WORKED VERY
HARD TO BE PERFECT
UP TILL NOW.

05:46.400 --> 05:47.934
I AM THROWING UP.

05:47.934 --> 05:50.734
I AM THROWING UP
ALL OVER YOU.

05:50.734 --> 05:53.867
Deejay: OK! ARE YOU
READY TO WIN SOME
SUPER BOWL TICKETS?!

05:53.867 --> 05:56.500
OK. IF I WAS A PAIR
OF SUPER BOWL TICKETS,

05:56.500 --> 05:57.834
HOW WOULD I FIND ME?

05:57.834 --> 06:00.300
IT'S AN INTERESTING
QUESTION, SHAWN.

06:00.300 --> 06:01.667
ANOTHER
INTERESTING QUESTION--

06:01.667 --> 06:04.900
WHY WOULD
FEENY MAKE SUCH AN
IMPOSSIBLE ASSIGNMENT?

06:04.900 --> 06:06.934
Deejay: WE'VE GOT THE LAST

THE OTHER GUY'S
AN ESKIMO.

09:12.567 --> 09:14.900
AND HE'S EATING
AN ICE-CREAM CONE.

09:14.900 --> 09:16.600
HE'S FROM
THE INUIT TRIBE.

09:16.600 --> 09:19.934
HE COMES TO PHILADELPHIA

I HAD A CHANCE TO GO
TO THE SUPER BOWL,

REALLY DID, HUH?

WAS IMPOSSIBLE.

FEENY KNEW THAT.

09:46.500 --> 09:50.233
ALL RIGHT, MR. FEENY,

09:58.300 --> 09:59.934
THAT WHEN YOU'RE
TEACHING US SOMETHING,

09:59.934 --> 10:01.967
WE SHOULD LOOK
FOR THE LESSON
BEHIND THE LESSON?

10:01.967 --> 10:06.100
WELL, WE LOOKED, AND WE
FIGURED THIS ONE OUT
ALL BY OURSELVES.

10:06.100 --> 10:08.400

HELP THEM, MR. FEENY.

10:08.400 --> 10:10.100
EVEN THOUGH WE THINK
SOMETHING'S IMPOSSIBLE,

10:10.100 --> 10:13.200
WE STILL SHOULD HAVE TRIED

IMPORTANT TO DO WORK

TO HELP THEM SUCCEED.

10:46.400 --> 10:48.100

THE WAY, MR. MATTHEWS?

18:37.800 --> 18:41.867
WELL, YEAH. I MEAN,
I REALLY FELT LIKE I SHOULD.

18:41.867 --> 18:45.467
I KNOW THE ASSIGNMENT
WAS TO HELP HIM SUCCEED,

18:45.467 --> 18:46.767
BUT...

18:46.767 --> 18:48.000
MR. FEENY, IT WAS LIKE

18:48.000 --> 18:50.300
HE DIDN'T NEED MY HELP
ON THIS ONE, YOU KNOW?

18:50.300 --> 18:52.800
HE WAS GONNA DO THIS ONE
ON HIS OWN,

18:52.800 --> 18:53.734
NO MATTER WHAT.

18:55.200 --> 18:57.100
GUESS I FAILED, HUH?

18:57.100 --> 18:58.400
OH, ON THE CONTRARY,

18:58.400 --> 19:01.567
MR. MATTHEWS, YOU PASSED
WITH FLYING COLORS

19:01.567 --> 19:03.100
AND SO DOES MR. HUNTER.

19:03.100 --> 19:05.200
OF COURSE WE DID.

19:05.200 --> 19:07.867
AND CLEARLY YOU'VE
WASTED ALL YOUR TIME

19:07.867 --> 19:11.133
AND I CONTINUE
TO COMPREHEND NOTHING.

19:11.133 --> 19:15.200
CORY, SHAWN ISN'T
GOING TO GO TO COLLEGE
AND SUCCEED

19:15.200 --> 19:17.567
BECAUSE YOU WANT HIM TO.

19:17.567 --> 19:21.300
<i>HE </i>HAS TO WANT TO
AND BELIEVE THAT HE CAN.

19:21.300 --> 19:23.967
AND THE ONLY WAY HE CAN
DO THAT IS ON HIS OWN

19:23.967 --> 19:25.567
WITHOUT YOUR HELP.

19:25.567 --> 19:28.300
THEN WHY DID YOU
WANT ME TO HELP HIM?

19:28.300 --> 19:31.700
YOU NEED TO KNOW
YOU WON'T ALWAYS
BE ABLE TO.

19:33.567 --> 19:35.000
YEAH, LIKE PRETTY SOON

19:35.000 --> 19:36.500
WE'RE ALL GONNA HAVE
TO DO THINGS ON OUR OWN

19:36.500 --> 19:37.800
WITHOUT SOMEONE'S HELP.

19:37.800 --> 19:38.934
RIGHT, MR. FEENY?

19:40.400 --> 19:42.500
I THINK I UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU'VE BEEN SO UPSET.

19:42.500 --> 19:45.100
AND I THINK I KNOW
WHY YOU'RE GONNA KEEP
GIVING US ASSIGNMENTS

19:45.100 --> 19:47.934
EVERY DAY UNTIL
OUR LAST DAY WITH YOU.

19:47.934 --> 19:49.767
MS. LAWRENCE,
YOU'RE BUTTING IN.

19:49.767 --> 19:52.133
YEAH, I AM, SO FAIL ME.
THAT'S LIFE.

19:52.133 --> 19:53.900
YOU WON'T BE PERFECT
ANYMORE.

19:53.900 --> 19:55.400
WELL, NO ONE
SHOULD BE PERFECT.

19:55.400 --> 19:57.400
BESIDES, YOU LEARN
FROM FAILURE.

19:57.400 --> 19:59.367
AND I NEED
TO KNOW THAT, RIGHT?

19:59.367 --> 20:01.667
YOU JUST YELLED AT ME.

20:01.667 --> 20:03.800
BUT I'M MR. FEENY.

20:06.400 --> 20:08.400
ONE DAY YOU'RE GOING
TO HAVE TO LET US GO.

20:08.400 --> 20:10.467
ONE DAY
YOU WON'T BE ABLE
TO TEACH US ANYMORE,

20:10.467 --> 20:13.200
AND YOU CAN'T BE SURE
IF WE'RE GOING
TO BE ALL RIGHT.

20:16.867 --> 20:21.600
LIFE IS A LOT TOUGHER
THAN SCHOOL, MY DEARS.

20:21.600 --> 20:23.734
BUT THE RIGHT THING TO DO

20:23.734 --> 20:26.800
IS JUST STEP ASIDE
AND LET US LIVE IT.

20:26.800 --> 20:30.233
I MEAN, WE LEARNED THAT
BECAUSE YOU TAUGHT IT TO US.

20:38.300 --> 20:39.834
OOH, WHAT A GAME!

20:39.834 --> 20:42.300
THIS IS
THE BEST SUPER BOWL
SINCE SUPER BOWL XX!

20:42.300 --> 20:43.200
YES!

20:43.200 --> 20:44.734
THIS MAKES THEM SO HAPPY.

20:44.734 --> 20:46.200
WHAT ELSE IS ON?

20:46.200 --> 20:48.367
WELL, FOX IS
COUNTERPROGRAMMING

20:48.367 --> 20:50.900
WITH<i>AMERICA'S</i>
<i>WORST FAMILY ATROCITIES.</i>

20:50.900 --> 20:52.200
YOU CHANGE THAT CHANNEL,

20:52.200 --> 20:53.834
AND YOU'RE GONNA BE
ON THAT PROGRAM.

20:53.834 --> 20:55.033
WAY TO GO!

20:55.033 --> 20:56.200
GO! GO! GO! GO!

20:56.200 --> 20:57.500
OH, YEAH!

20:57.500 --> 20:58.734
HUH!
HUH!

20:58.734 --> 20:59.567
[BOTH GRUNTING]

20:59.567 --> 21:01.300
YES! YES! YES!

21:01.300 --> 21:02.734
LOOK AT THAT!

21:02.734 --> 21:04.133
LOOK AT WHAT, GEORGE?
THAT PLAY'S OVER.

21:04.133 --> 21:05.567
I'M LOOKING
AT THE CROWD!

21:05.567 --> 21:07.700
LOOK AT THE BOY
HOLDING UP THE SIGN!

21:07.700 --> 21:09.200
WHICH ONE?

21:09.200 --> 21:10.734
THE ONE THAT SAYS,

21:10.734 --> 21:11.967
"HEY, FEENY.

21:11.967 --> 21:13.500
NOTHING'S IMPOSSIBLE."
