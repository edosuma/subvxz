WEBVTT

00:05.665 --> 00:07.698
Well, it's been
a very emotional week

00:07.700 --> 00:09.100
here at the Hammerade Air Races.

00:09.102 --> 00:12.069
Through it all, we've seen
some incredible flying.

00:12.071 --> 00:14.272
We still have
one final run to go.

00:14.274 --> 00:15.573
And here comes our pilot now.

00:15.575 --> 00:17.775
And there's the smoke
as he begins the first lap,

00:17.777 --> 00:19.644
coming through the chicane.

00:19.646 --> 00:21.212
♪ Or the track leading
down to the beach... ♪

00:21.214 --> 00:23.514
He's pushing up against
that 200-knot starting speed,

00:23.516 --> 00:25.917
but he's got to watch his
altitude. And it looks like...

00:25.919 --> 00:28.819
yes, he's a little late
with the turn.

00:28.821 --> 00:30.221
That's gonna carry over
to gate three.

00:30.223 --> 00:32.122
He's got to make up
the time, and... oh,

00:32.125 --> 00:35.860
it looks like he has just made
the correct level for gate five.

00:35.862 --> 00:37.595
He's got his wings
nicely leveled.

00:37.597 --> 00:39.797
Now, we don't know much
about this new pilot,

00:39.799 --> 00:42.099
but if he's anything
like the old Shadow Baron,

00:42.101 --> 00:43.601
he could be the dark horse
in this race.

00:43.603 --> 00:45.569
♪ You're driving too fast ♪

00:45.571 --> 00:47.672

00:58.151 --> 01:00.318
♪ Driving too fast,
hang on to the wheel... ♪

01:00.320 --> 01:01.786
I got you, babe.
What's the matter?

01:01.788 --> 01:03.287
Nothing's wrong.
How's my time?

01:03.289 --> 01:05.289
Time? I... Your time's fine.

01:05.291 --> 01:06.691
What does it...
what does it matter?

01:06.693 --> 01:07.892
Matters to me.

01:10.663 --> 01:12.964
You know, Steve,
the only thing you had to do

01:12.966 --> 01:15.266
was put the plane up in the air.
That's it. Nothing else.

01:15.268 --> 01:17.101
Okay?
Hold that thought.

01:17.103 --> 01:19.070
Into the second lap now,
and there...

01:19.072 --> 01:21.739
that's a very nice, controlled
turn through gate two.

01:21.741 --> 01:23.541
I'm getting
motion sickness

01:23.543 --> 01:24.742
just watching this.

01:24.744 --> 01:26.911
Better watch your feet,
'cause I may boot.

01:26.913 --> 01:28.079
Jerry, these are new shoes.

01:28.081 --> 01:29.780
If you puke on them,
I will hurt you.

01:29.782 --> 01:31.549
Now, every time those wings

01:31.551 --> 01:33.084
are not completely level,
when he's not centered up

01:33.086 --> 01:35.553
going through those gates,
it's gonna be harder not to clip

01:35.555 --> 01:37.855
one of those pylons.

01:37.857 --> 01:40.791
And now coming towards eight...

01:40.793 --> 01:43.794
Oh, that was very close.

01:43.796 --> 01:45.830
- All right!
- An inch higher,

01:45.832 --> 01:48.499
and he would have been
in the red band.

01:48.501 --> 01:50.634
And now just two more gates.

01:50.636 --> 01:52.403
As long as he flies clean,
he can pull off

01:52.405 --> 01:54.005
a respectable time, and... oh!

01:54.007 --> 01:55.673
He just clipped the pylon.

01:55.675 --> 01:57.875
Looks like he couldn't adjust
for those north headwinds,

01:57.877 --> 01:59.176
and it looks like he's having

01:59.178 --> 02:00.578
some trouble
with the turbulence.

02:00.580 --> 02:03.114
He's got to straighten out
the wings.

02:03.116 --> 02:04.582
Steve? Steve?

02:04.584 --> 02:05.983
Steve!
Oh, my God.

02:05.985 --> 02:07.785
If he doesn't
get level, he's gonna risk

02:07.787 --> 02:09.620
hitting the water
at 175 knots, and...

02:09.622 --> 02:10.721
he's struggling.

02:10.723 --> 02:12.323
And it looks like... Oh, my God,

02:12.325 --> 02:14.525
he's losing control
of the plane!

“Ensign McGarrett.”
What's it been, 15 years?

03:13.453 --> 03:15.086
- Give or take. Give or take.
- Buddy.

03:15.088 --> 03:16.454
You look good, man.

03:16.456 --> 03:18.089
You, too.
Danny Williams, my partner.

03:18.091 --> 03:19.390
Nice to meet you.
Same here.

03:19.392 --> 03:21.892
I was just telling Danny
on the way over, this guy was

03:21.894 --> 03:23.861
the best mechanic
we ever had on base,

03:23.863 --> 03:25.796
and-and probably the best
mechanic I ever met.

03:25.798 --> 03:27.865
- I learned a lot from this man.
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

03:27.867 --> 03:29.266
Hey, you and your
dad ever get

03:29.268 --> 03:30.801
that old Mercury
out there on the road?

03:30.803 --> 03:34.405
Nah, man, we never
really got there.

03:34.407 --> 03:36.540
Oh, that's a shame.
What brings you to the island, man?

03:36.542 --> 03:38.576
Well, I'm here for the
Hammerade Air Races.

03:38.578 --> 03:41.512
I've been one of their chief
mechanics the last ten years.

03:41.514 --> 03:42.780
Hey, I heard one
of your pilots

03:42.782 --> 03:43.981
crashed the other day.
Is that right?

03:43.983 --> 03:46.517
Yeah, that's actually why
I asked you here.

03:46.519 --> 03:47.718
I need your help.

03:47.720 --> 03:49.753
That pilot
was my pilot.

03:49.755 --> 03:52.189
His plane nose-dived into the
water during a training session,

03:52.191 --> 03:53.991
and, uh, he was killed
on impact.

03:53.993 --> 03:55.759
I'm sorry, Ronnie.

03:55.761 --> 03:57.294
What was his name?
Jason Sachs.

03:57.296 --> 04:00.097
But the public knew him
as the Shadow Baron.

04:00.099 --> 04:01.432
Shadow Baron, huh?

04:01.434 --> 04:03.033
It was his alter ego.

04:03.035 --> 04:05.903
The races are like, uh,
pro wrestling.

04:05.905 --> 04:08.205
All the pilots
have fake personas.

04:08.207 --> 04:09.540
The Crimson Ace.

04:09.542 --> 04:11.008
Uh, Midnight Flyer.

04:11.010 --> 04:13.144
Amelia Sweetheart.
A lot of showmanship.

04:13.146 --> 04:15.079
But the flying's
all legit.

04:15.081 --> 04:17.148
Jason's angle
was anonymity.

04:17.149 --> 04:18.382
Always wore a helmet.

04:18.384 --> 04:19.683
Never showed his face.

04:19.685 --> 04:21.185
Didn't talk much.

04:21.187 --> 04:23.187
Figured, uh,
the more mysterious he was,

04:23.189 --> 04:24.889
the more interesting he'd be.

04:24.891 --> 04:27.324
So, what do you
need from us?

04:27.326 --> 04:29.360
I'd like for you to look
into the crash.

04:30.496 --> 04:32.229
Right.
That's, um...

04:32.231 --> 04:33.831
that's NTSB's thing.

04:33.833 --> 04:36.233
Yeah. And they've been
investigating.

04:36.235 --> 04:38.202
But they only just fished
Jason's plane

04:38.204 --> 04:40.304
out of the water yesterday,
and I'm already hearing

04:40.306 --> 04:43.073
they're going to declare
this thing pilot error.

04:43.075 --> 04:44.975
You don't agree with that,
obviously.

04:44.977 --> 04:46.911
Not for a second.
Could've been anything.

04:46.913 --> 04:49.146
You know, a defective part,
design flaw.

04:49.148 --> 04:50.981
Hell, sabotage, for all I know.

04:50.983 --> 04:53.851
You got any evidence
to back these theories up?

04:53.853 --> 04:56.954
NTSB won't let me
near the wreckage.

04:56.956 --> 04:59.023
Well, if they've seen the plane
and you have not, why, uh...

04:59.025 --> 05:00.224
why not just take
their word for it?

05:00.226 --> 05:03.727
Jason was the best pilot
I've ever seen.

05:03.729 --> 05:06.063
This guy came out of
nowhere five years ago.

05:06.065 --> 05:07.264
No military background.

05:07.266 --> 05:09.700
Never flew any
commercial aircraft.

05:09.702 --> 05:12.236
But he could do anything
in the sky.

05:12.238 --> 05:14.805
Up there, he was ice cold.

05:14.807 --> 05:16.373
You know, no mistakes.

05:16.375 --> 05:20.878
There's no way this
was pilot error.

05:21.914 --> 05:24.982
Ronnie, I got to
ask you something.

05:24.984 --> 05:28.552
Is it possible this
could have been mechanical?

05:28.554 --> 05:30.020
You know me, Steve.

05:30.022 --> 05:33.023
There's no way I would ever
let anything leave the ground

05:33.025 --> 05:34.592
I wouldn't fly myself.
Right.

05:34.594 --> 05:38.629
Hammerade and the pilot do one
final inspection the day of.

05:38.631 --> 05:41.398
But I looked that plane over
myself the night before.

05:41.400 --> 05:42.866
Nose to rudder.

05:42.868 --> 05:44.501
That thing was clean.

05:45.638 --> 05:47.538
Look, I know you guys

05:47.540 --> 05:49.873
don't normally
do stuff like this,

05:49.875 --> 05:52.576
but Jason was a good guy

05:52.578 --> 05:54.612
with a wife and
little boy.

05:54.614 --> 05:58.916
The NTSB declares this
crash pilot error,

05:58.918 --> 06:02.019
insurance won't pay
his family a dime.

06:02.021 --> 06:04.288
Neither will Hammerade.

06:04.290 --> 06:06.824
They'll be left with nothing.

06:11.497 --> 06:12.663
It's tragic.

06:12.665 --> 06:13.964
It could have been
worse, though.

06:13.966 --> 06:15.766
If this had happened
closer to shore,

06:15.768 --> 06:17.067
during the actual race,

06:17.069 --> 06:18.802
there could have been
dozens of casualties.

06:18.804 --> 06:20.871
Agent Callaghan,
where are you guys at

06:20.873 --> 06:21.972
with the investigation?

06:21.974 --> 06:23.107
Our preliminary
investigation

06:23.109 --> 06:24.441
should be
wrapping up soon.

06:24.443 --> 06:25.542
But at this point,

06:25.544 --> 06:27.745
all indications are
this was pilot error.

06:27.747 --> 06:29.280
Okay, it's a little
early to make

06:29.282 --> 06:31.048
a call like that,
though, right?

06:31.050 --> 06:33.884
This wasn't a 747
that just dropped off the radar.

06:33.886 --> 06:35.986
It's a little more cut and dry
when you're dealing

06:35.988 --> 06:37.321
with an aircraft
like this.

06:37.323 --> 06:38.889
Believe me, I've been
covering these races

06:38.891 --> 06:40.491
for NTSB since '06.

06:40.493 --> 06:42.393
When you've seen as many
of these incidents

06:42.395 --> 06:44.361
as I have, you recognize
when it's the plane

06:44.363 --> 06:45.696
and when it's the pilot.

06:45.698 --> 06:48.165
Now, we're gonna ship the
wreckage back to D.C.

06:48.167 --> 06:49.633
for further analysis,
but otherwise,

06:49.635 --> 06:51.735
we should be done
in the next day or two.

06:51.737 --> 06:53.037
Oh...

07:01.480 --> 07:02.880
Have all the pieces
been recovered?

07:02.882 --> 07:06.150
There are a few components
that are still unaccounted for.

07:06.152 --> 07:09.086
Uh... couple left-wing bolts,
uh, part of the landing gear,

07:09.088 --> 07:11.021
the trim tab.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

07:11.023 --> 07:13.424
Trim tab?
You don't have the trim tab?

07:13.426 --> 07:14.658
We're confident the conclusion

07:14.660 --> 07:16.293
will be the same
with or without it.

07:16.295 --> 07:17.969
I-I don't know too much
about planes.

07:17.971 --> 07:18.646
What's a trim tab?

07:18.670 --> 07:21.160
Tr-Trim tab is the
rudder of the plane.

07:21.267 --> 07:23.267
It goes right here. If anything
were to happen mechanically

07:23.269 --> 07:25.569
to this thing up in the air,
the pilot would lose

07:25.571 --> 07:27.004
control of the plane.
Isn't that right?

07:27.006 --> 07:29.673
So, without
that piece,

07:29.675 --> 07:32.176
pretty hard to come to a
real conclusion, right?

07:32.178 --> 07:35.346
I'm sure you gentlemen
have closed plenty of cases

07:35.348 --> 07:36.847
despite not having access

07:36.849 --> 07:38.582
to every piece
of potential evidence.

07:38.584 --> 07:41.752
We work with the
clues that we have.

07:41.754 --> 07:43.620
Okay.
Maybe you can, uh,

07:43.622 --> 07:44.855
do something else for us.

07:44.857 --> 07:46.390
We'd like to see
the cockpit video

07:46.392 --> 07:47.691
if that's not too much trouble.

07:47.693 --> 07:50.294
You're welcome to put in
a request to review any footage

07:50.296 --> 07:52.029
after the investigation
is complete.

07:52.031 --> 07:53.831
You're in charge
of this investigation, right?

07:53.833 --> 07:54.965
Yes.
Okay.

07:54.967 --> 07:56.400
All I'm asking is for you

07:56.402 --> 07:57.901
to cut through a little
red tape

07:57.903 --> 08:00.270
and let us see that video
as a professional courtesy.

08:00.272 --> 08:02.306
Look, don't take this
the wrong way,

08:02.308 --> 08:03.907
Commander, Detective,

08:03.909 --> 08:05.909
but unless a crime
has been committed,

08:05.911 --> 08:07.811
we're the sole investigators
on this case.

08:07.813 --> 08:10.381
That means that we don't have
to share anything with anyone.

08:10.383 --> 08:12.116
Especially if you're gonna
come in here

08:12.118 --> 08:14.084
and question my team's work.

08:15.688 --> 08:17.321
But I would be
more than happy

08:17.323 --> 08:19.456
to keep you guys in the loop
from here on out.

08:19.458 --> 08:22.393
As a... professional courtesy.

08:23.362 --> 08:25.763
Now, unless there's
something else,

08:25.765 --> 08:27.664
I've got to get back to work.

08:27.666 --> 08:28.966
No, go ahead, man.

08:28.968 --> 08:30.200
We'll, uh, see ourselves out.

08:30.202 --> 08:31.935
Thanks.
Yeah.

08:33.773 --> 08:34.972
You know what I think?

08:34.974 --> 08:36.940
I think that you being
exposed to that radiation

08:36.942 --> 08:38.708
is the best thing to
ever happen to you.

08:38.711 --> 08:40.811
Oh, this should be good.
No, no, no, look at this.

08:40.813 --> 08:42.078
Peter Parker, right?
He gets bit

08:42.081 --> 08:43.847
by a radioactive spider,
turns into a superhero.

08:43.849 --> 08:45.616
You, a superhero,
you, uh,

08:45.618 --> 08:47.684
get hooked up with
some radiation,

08:47.686 --> 08:50.988
and you turn into a
human being, huh?

08:50.990 --> 08:51.955
What's your point?

08:51.957 --> 08:54.057
Pre-radioactive Steve

08:54.059 --> 08:56.026
would have punched that guy
right in the mouth.

08:56.028 --> 08:56.584
Proud of you.

08:56.608 --> 08:58.728
Oh, you think I didn't want
to punch him in the mouth?

08:58.831 --> 09:01.331
Let me tell you something,
this guy making a call like that

09:01.333 --> 09:03.100
without a crucial piece
of evidence,

09:03.102 --> 09:05.736
one of two things--
either he's a complete idiot,

09:05.738 --> 09:07.871
or he's hiding something.

09:18.889 --> 09:20.501
Hey, so where
were you this morning?

09:20.505 --> 09:22.972
I called to see if you
wanted to go for a paddle.

09:22.974 --> 09:25.008
Yeah, I went to see my parents.

09:25.911 --> 09:27.210
How'd that go?

09:28.180 --> 09:30.780
My dad and I had
some scintillating eye contact.

09:30.782 --> 09:32.015
Scintillating?

09:32.017 --> 09:34.684
Yeah. I'm showing off.

09:34.686 --> 09:37.153
So, your mom must have been
happy to see you.

09:37.155 --> 09:39.289
I waited an hour.

09:39.291 --> 09:40.890
She never showed.

09:41.993 --> 09:43.993
So it was just you
and your dad, then?

09:43.995 --> 09:46.729
I guess.

09:47.766 --> 09:49.532
You must have talked
about something.

09:49.534 --> 09:51.901
Yeah.
When he emptied his drink,

09:51.903 --> 09:54.904
he mentioned wanting to put
a garbage can on the porch.

09:55.907 --> 09:57.440
Yeah.

09:58.543 --> 10:00.543
What's the deal between you two?

10:01.546 --> 10:03.947
He didn't want me to enlist.

10:03.949 --> 10:06.416
Wait, but wasn't he
in the Navy, too?

10:07.419 --> 10:09.619
That's the reason why.

10:12.958 --> 10:14.924
It's complicated.
Trust me.

10:14.926 --> 10:16.059
I get complicated.

10:16.061 --> 10:18.294
Yeah, see, your
brother, my father--

10:18.296 --> 10:20.163
they'd probably
get along just great.

10:21.366 --> 10:23.266
Hold on.

10:23.268 --> 10:24.801
Everything okay?

10:24.803 --> 10:26.135
Yeah. It's McGarrett.

10:26.137 --> 10:27.737
I'm getting called
off the bench.

10:27.739 --> 10:28.905
Big-league playa.

10:28.907 --> 10:29.906
Yeah, hardly.

10:29.908 --> 10:31.107
I'm really sorry.
I have to go.

10:31.109 --> 10:33.109
See, I can't wait
to say that.

10:33.111 --> 10:35.678
Well, be careful
what you wish for.

10:39.150 --> 10:40.216
All right.

10:40.218 --> 10:41.584
We'll finish
this conversation later.

10:41.586 --> 10:43.886
All right. Shoots.

10:43.888 --> 10:46.155
<i>Since the NTSB</i>
<i>wouldn't give you guys access</i>

10:46.157 --> 10:47.991
to the cockpit footage,

10:47.993 --> 10:50.159
I scoured YouTube looking
for video of the crash.

10:50.161 --> 10:52.262
Unfortunately,
there weren't too many people

10:52.264 --> 10:53.763
on a closed beach watching

10:53.765 --> 10:55.231
a practice flight at
7:00 in the morning.

10:55.233 --> 10:57.100
This is all I could find.

11:01.106 --> 11:03.139
So, how does this work?

11:03.141 --> 11:04.874
It's like Indy 500 in the sky.

11:04.876 --> 11:06.209
This is the
practice run.

11:06.211 --> 11:08.011
It takes place a couple
days before the timed heat.

11:08.013 --> 11:09.012
All right, the pilots

11:09.014 --> 11:10.213
have to maneuver
their planes

11:10.215 --> 11:11.281
between those pylons

11:11.283 --> 11:13.049
at a certain height,
all right?

11:13.051 --> 11:15.385
Any of them fly outside
of the designated window

11:15.387 --> 11:18.321
or clip a pylon,
it's a time penalty.

11:19.658 --> 11:21.357
Wait a minute.
That's weird.

11:21.359 --> 11:23.593
Jason's plane should have banked
left to make the next gate.

11:23.595 --> 11:25.361
Maybe this is where
something went wrong.

11:28.700 --> 11:31.367
Jerry, play it back.

11:35.006 --> 11:36.472
So, what, you
think that trim thing

11:36.474 --> 11:37.540
you were
talking about

11:37.542 --> 11:38.908
caused the crash?
It's possible.

11:38.910 --> 11:39.976
Maybe it didn't open,

11:39.978 --> 11:41.511
or it came loose
during the flight.

11:41.513 --> 11:43.546
I can't tell from this footage,
but you know what?

11:43.548 --> 11:46.716
Ronnie said that the same
company that made this plane

11:46.718 --> 11:48.084
had trouble with the trim tabs

11:48.086 --> 11:49.752
on a bunch of other planes
they made.

11:49.754 --> 11:51.821
The only way we can tell
if that's the case

11:51.823 --> 11:53.656
in this instance
is by finding that trim tab.

11:53.658 --> 11:55.925
Well, you said the NTSB guys
took a couple of days

11:55.927 --> 11:57.794
to drag that wreckage
out of there, didn't you?

11:57.796 --> 11:59.262
- Yeah.
- Well, then isn't it possible

11:59.264 --> 12:00.396
somebody just dove down there,

12:00.398 --> 12:02.165
knew what they were looking for
and grabbed it?

12:02.167 --> 12:03.333
Sure. Anything's possible.

12:03.335 --> 12:05.268
Including the “S” word?

12:05.270 --> 12:06.469
The “S” word?

12:06.471 --> 12:08.805
Yeah, you know-- “sabotage.”

12:08.807 --> 12:10.440
Oh, that “S” word. Yeah.

12:10.442 --> 12:11.541
Sabotage, Jerry?

12:11.543 --> 12:12.975
Yeah, like someone messed
with this guy's plane on purpose.

12:12.977 --> 12:15.244
I know what the
word means, Jerry.

12:15.246 --> 12:16.279
Wait a minute.

12:16.281 --> 12:17.814
Actually, he may be
on to something.

12:17.816 --> 12:19.816
Air racing
is a very competitive sport.

12:19.818 --> 12:21.250
There's loads
of prize money at stake.

12:21.252 --> 12:23.353
It's possible that somebody
got sick of Jason Sachs

12:23.355 --> 12:25.355
winning it all the time.

12:31.396 --> 12:33.529
I looked at Jason Sachs'
autopsy report.

12:33.531 --> 12:36.399
Cause of death
was blunt abdominal trauma.

12:36.401 --> 12:37.667
I'm guessing
that's pretty consistent

12:37.669 --> 12:38.901
with most crash victims.

12:38.903 --> 12:40.236
Correct.

12:40.238 --> 12:42.271
Well, how was his general
health otherwise?

12:42.273 --> 12:44.140
Did he have any kind
of a preexisting thing

12:44.142 --> 12:46.075
that might have flared up
at the wrong time?

12:46.077 --> 12:47.677
Based on the medical reports,

12:47.679 --> 12:49.812
Mr. Sachs
was in excellent health.

12:49.814 --> 12:52.281
And his tox screen was negative
for any drugs or alcohol.

12:52.283 --> 12:53.349
So there's nothing

12:53.351 --> 12:54.484
that could have happened
to him physically

12:54.486 --> 12:55.818
that might have led
to the crash?

12:55.820 --> 12:57.220
Not quite.

12:57.222 --> 12:58.821
Flying at g-force speeds can put

12:58.823 --> 13:00.790
a tremendous amount of stress
on the human body.

13:00.792 --> 13:03.526
At four g's, most people tend
to lose consciousness.

13:03.528 --> 13:05.661
During a race,
pilots like Mr. Sachs

13:05.663 --> 13:07.263
can pull up to ten g's.

13:07.265 --> 13:09.899
Really? Okay, well,
then how come

13:09.901 --> 13:11.801
all these air jockeys
aren't blacking out

13:11.803 --> 13:13.770
and just dropping out
of the sky, then?

13:13.772 --> 13:15.571
They take certain
precautions--

13:15.573 --> 13:17.039
utilize special
breathing techniques,

13:17.041 --> 13:18.508
wear antigravity suits.

13:18.510 --> 13:20.910
But they're still taking a
huge risk when they're up there.

13:20.912 --> 13:23.246
Hold your breath for a
millisecond in that environment,

13:23.248 --> 13:24.714
and your brain can shut down.

13:24.716 --> 13:29.719
Okay. Well, with all the damage
that Jason's body sustained,

13:29.721 --> 13:31.687
is there a possibility
that the M.E.

13:31.689 --> 13:33.256
who conducted this autopsy

13:33.258 --> 13:36.592
might have missed some of
the signs of oxygen deprivation?

13:36.594 --> 13:39.796
Given the extent of the damage,
yeah, I'd say possible.

13:42.200 --> 13:44.100
Doc, I need you
to do me a favor.

13:44.102 --> 13:45.468
Do you think you can go back

13:45.470 --> 13:46.969
and double-check the math
on this thing?

13:46.971 --> 13:50.339
Maybe conduct a second autopsy
and see what we get from there?

13:53.645 --> 13:55.044
Jason always felt
more comfortable

13:55.046 --> 13:57.480
in the air than on the ground.

13:57.482 --> 13:59.782
His father had him
flying crop dusters

13:59.784 --> 14:01.551
by the time he was a teenager.

14:01.553 --> 14:03.419
How'd you guys meet?

14:03.421 --> 14:05.688
I was working at a bar
in Puerto Palomas,

14:05.690 --> 14:07.824
near the U.S. border.

14:07.826 --> 14:09.592
He came in for a
drink one night,

14:09.594 --> 14:11.360
and we started talking.

14:12.330 --> 14:14.030
He was wearing this old
brown leather jacket

14:14.032 --> 14:15.832
that belonged to his father.

14:16.835 --> 14:18.801
He always wore it
when he flew.

14:18.803 --> 14:21.504
He said it brought him luck.

14:22.507 --> 14:24.640
He loaned it to me that night.

14:24.642 --> 14:27.643
He was flying out,
so I tried to refuse,

14:27.645 --> 14:30.680
but he said he didn't want me
to be cold on my way home.

14:34.118 --> 14:36.219
And then he smiled.

14:38.990 --> 14:41.224
And I just knew.

14:46.197 --> 14:49.065
He came back
a few times after that.

14:50.301 --> 14:52.368
Back then, I was
with someone else.

14:53.638 --> 14:56.706
Someone who didn't
treat me well.

14:56.708 --> 14:58.474
One day, I was at work,

14:58.476 --> 15:01.077
and I heard a plane
land in the field.

15:01.079 --> 15:03.079
It was Jason.

15:03.982 --> 15:05.781
He told me to get in.

15:05.783 --> 15:07.350
I was terrified.

15:07.352 --> 15:11.187
But Jason, he was always
so sure of himself.

15:11.189 --> 15:16.058
Once he made up his mind
to do something, he did it.

15:16.060 --> 15:17.860
So I got in.

15:19.631 --> 15:22.598
And we flew over the
border to Texas.

15:23.935 --> 15:25.835
And I never looked back.

15:27.105 --> 15:28.337
Elena...

15:30.041 --> 15:32.441
Did Jason have any...

15:32.443 --> 15:35.144
problems with any
of the other pilots?

15:35.146 --> 15:36.412
Any rivalries?

15:36.414 --> 15:40.383
No. Most of the pilots
stage rivalries for publicity.

15:40.385 --> 15:42.718
Mm-hmm.
Maybe a couple of them don't get along,

15:42.720 --> 15:44.253
but no one had a
problem with Jason.

15:44.255 --> 15:45.922
Okay, but...

15:45.924 --> 15:47.757
the day of...
the day of the crash,

15:47.759 --> 15:50.760
was there anything
that-that could have

15:50.762 --> 15:53.529
distracted Jason
during that practice flight?

15:53.531 --> 15:54.630
Like what?

15:54.632 --> 15:56.198
He was always
so focused out there.

15:56.200 --> 15:57.466
I don't know.

15:57.468 --> 16:00.303
Did anything unusual
happen that day?

16:02.907 --> 16:04.173
What?

16:04.175 --> 16:07.743
That morning,
we were going out for breakfast

16:07.745 --> 16:10.212
before the practice run.

16:10.214 --> 16:15.284
Tomás was fussing, so I told
Jason to meet us outside.

16:15.286 --> 16:18.955
When we went downstairs,
I saw Jason talking to a man.

16:18.957 --> 16:21.924
He walked away
before we got there,

16:21.926 --> 16:23.859
but I could tell he was upset.

16:24.996 --> 16:26.462
I asked Jason who he was,

16:26.464 --> 16:29.031
but he said there was
a misunderstanding.

16:29.867 --> 16:32.168
Okay.

16:35.173 --> 16:37.073
You okay?

16:38.443 --> 16:40.009
Yeah.

16:42.180 --> 16:46.616
You know, they say every
murder has two victims.

16:46.618 --> 16:49.986
The deceased and the family
they leave in the wake.

16:51.689 --> 16:54.557
It's good to care, Tani.

16:58.963 --> 17:00.630
Should I see
if Jerry can pull up

17:00.632 --> 17:01.564
the hotel's security footage,

17:01.566 --> 17:03.466
see if we can I.D.
this mystery guy

17:03.468 --> 17:04.599
that Jason was talking to?

17:04.602 --> 17:06.636
That's a good idea.
See if we can figure out

17:06.637 --> 17:07.903
what that conversation
was about.

17:07.905 --> 17:10.106
It's Ronnie.

17:10.108 --> 17:12.540
Hey, Ronnie.
Hey, we just spoke to Elena.

17:12.542 --> 17:14.377
Steve, I found it.

17:14.378 --> 17:15.744
What? What'd you find?

17:15.747 --> 17:16.878
The trim tab.

17:16.881 --> 17:17.980
What?

17:17.982 --> 17:19.348
How'd you get that?

17:19.349 --> 17:20.915
One of the Hammerade
race technicians

17:20.917 --> 17:22.151
fished it out of the ocean.

17:22.153 --> 17:24.185
What, and he just
gave it to you?

17:24.188 --> 17:26.155
Not exactly.

17:28.226 --> 17:29.325
What'd you do, Ronnie?

17:29.327 --> 17:30.426
Look, Jason was like

17:30.428 --> 17:31.427
a brother to me, Steve.

17:31.429 --> 17:33.095
I don't have
to explain that to you.

17:34.565 --> 17:36.432
Don't move, all right?
We're on the way.

17:50.166 --> 17:51.799
Those look like
government plates.

17:51.870 --> 17:53.303
Can't be good.

17:57.985 --> 17:59.150
Yo.

17:59.152 --> 18:00.819
NTSB was just here.

18:00.821 --> 18:02.153
They confiscated the tab

18:02.155 --> 18:03.555
before I could get
a good look at it.

18:03.557 --> 18:05.156
I don't even know
how they knew I was here.

18:05.158 --> 18:06.758
Callaghan's boys must
have been keeping an eye

18:06.760 --> 18:08.426
on you and anybody
else on Jason's team.

18:08.428 --> 18:10.428
I'm sorry. I shouldn't
have let them take it.

18:10.430 --> 18:12.263
You didn't exactly
have a choice, Ronnie.

18:13.100 --> 18:14.366
What do we do now?

18:14.368 --> 18:16.801
You still got that technician?

18:22.676 --> 18:24.909
Hey.

18:24.911 --> 18:27.445
Can see why you two
were friends.

18:28.615 --> 18:29.714
Isaiah Phillips.

18:29.716 --> 18:32.851
Been with the Hammerade
Air Races since 2014.

18:32.853 --> 18:34.352
You were with the
Reno Air Races

18:34.354 --> 18:35.553
before that
for six years.

18:35.555 --> 18:36.654
Rumor has it, though,

18:36.656 --> 18:38.957
you were fired
after two planes went down

18:38.959 --> 18:40.859
due to mechanical problems
that you missed

18:40.861 --> 18:41.812
during your final inspection.

18:41.836 --> 18:43.129
All right, here's
what I'm thinking.

18:43.130 --> 18:45.330
You know the history
with these trim tabs.

18:45.332 --> 18:46.865
Right? So you must
have known

18:46.867 --> 18:48.333
there was something wrong
with the one

18:48.335 --> 18:51.302
on Jason's plane,
which is why his plane crashed

18:51.304 --> 18:52.537
in the ocean.
Okay?

18:52.539 --> 18:54.039
Now, of course,

18:54.041 --> 18:56.241
it was up to you
to spot any problems--

18:56.243 --> 18:58.410
which you didn't
because you got sloppy again.

18:58.412 --> 19:01.946
So now it's CYA time,
isn't it?

19:01.948 --> 19:04.916
So you go fish the trim tab
out of the water.

19:04.918 --> 19:07.619
That way, nobody knows
that your third screwup

19:07.621 --> 19:10.555
in nine years
cost a man his life.

19:10.557 --> 19:12.557
All right, yeah.

19:12.559 --> 19:14.526
The way that plane
spun out of control,

19:14.528 --> 19:16.394
I knew there had to have been
something wrong

19:16.396 --> 19:20.398
with one of the tabs--
something I should have caught.

19:20.400 --> 19:22.901
But I'm not the only one
responsible for what happened.

19:22.903 --> 19:24.035
Yeah, yeah, yeah, we know.

19:24.037 --> 19:25.603
The-the company
that made Jason's plane--

19:25.605 --> 19:28.006
they're the big villains
in all this, da-da-da, right?

19:28.008 --> 19:29.641
Not this time.

19:29.643 --> 19:30.675
What do you mean?

19:30.677 --> 19:32.043
Those other tabs that failed
were made

19:32.045 --> 19:33.278
from an alloy that would heat up

19:33.280 --> 19:34.712
whenever the planes
hit a certain speed.

19:34.714 --> 19:36.314
The heat would cause
the tab to warp.

19:36.316 --> 19:39.884
But the tabs on Jason's
were standard steel.

19:39.886 --> 19:41.853
He wouldn't have had
the same problem.

19:41.855 --> 19:43.621
What are you saying?
This was a mechanical issue?

19:43.623 --> 19:45.356
I don't think so.

19:45.358 --> 19:47.325
See, I got a good look
at that tab

19:47.327 --> 19:49.327
before your crazy friend
showed up.

19:49.329 --> 19:51.463
I think somebody messed with it.

19:52.699 --> 19:53.898
You're saying it's sabotage.

19:53.900 --> 19:55.934
Yeah.

19:56.937 --> 19:58.636
Tani.

20:03.977 --> 20:05.810
You buy any of that?

20:06.646 --> 20:08.413
I don't know.

20:08.415 --> 20:10.515
I mean, even if it was sabotage,
doesn't get this guy

20:10.517 --> 20:11.516
off the hook.

20:11.518 --> 20:12.984
I know.
Why would he lie, though?

20:12.986 --> 20:14.085
I know.

20:14.087 --> 20:16.087
NTSB just held
a press conference.

20:16.089 --> 20:17.489
They announced their ruling
on the crash.

20:17.491 --> 20:18.923
What did they say?

20:21.394 --> 20:22.927
Earlier this week,
we pulled the wreckage

20:22.929 --> 20:25.063
of Jason Sachs' plane
out of Waikiki Bay,

20:25.065 --> 20:26.598
where it crashed
during a practice run

20:26.600 --> 20:28.867
for this week's
Hammerade Air Race.

20:28.869 --> 20:30.768
After analysis of the aircraft,

20:30.770 --> 20:32.804
as well as the cockpit
and the exterior footage

20:32.806 --> 20:34.873
in the moments
leading up to the tragedy,

20:34.875 --> 20:38.510
we've concluded that the crash
was caused by pilot error.

20:38.512 --> 20:40.345
Son of a bitch.

20:40.347 --> 20:43.581
Mr. Sachs, known to most by
his alias “the Shadow Baron,”

20:43.583 --> 20:44.849
was a well-respected aviator

20:44.851 --> 20:46.284
with thousands of hours
of flight time...

20:46.286 --> 20:49.254
It looks like we may have
another government cover-up.

20:50.490 --> 20:52.157
All right.
We got to get our hands

20:52.159 --> 20:53.892
on that trim tab,
do our own analysis.

20:53.894 --> 20:55.093
That's the only way we're gonna

20:55.095 --> 20:56.561
figure out
what actually happened.

20:56.563 --> 20:58.897
Will the NTSB allow that?
I highly doubt it.

20:58.899 --> 21:00.098
I can call the governor,

21:00.100 --> 21:02.700
see if she can help.
And if she can't?

21:02.702 --> 21:05.470
If she can't, we're gonna have
to figure out something else.

21:09.042 --> 21:10.942
Thank you.

21:13.246 --> 21:14.812
Norman Andrews?

21:15.615 --> 21:17.849
Captain Lou Grover.

21:17.851 --> 21:19.083
That's Detective
Danny Williams.

21:19.085 --> 21:20.151
We're both with Five-O.

21:20.153 --> 21:21.486
What do you want?

21:21.488 --> 21:23.988
We just want to talk to you
about a conversation you had

21:23.990 --> 21:25.657
with Jason Sachs the other day.

21:30.697 --> 21:32.664
Ten years ago,
this guy comes to me

21:32.666 --> 21:33.898
with an investment opportunity.

21:33.900 --> 21:35.800
Says he's working
on the next Google, and he...

21:35.802 --> 21:38.002
he shows me the business plans,
the algorithm.

21:38.004 --> 21:40.138
He says I can get in
on the ground floor,

21:40.140 --> 21:41.940
make a fortune, so...

21:41.942 --> 21:44.676
I invested my entire
life savings,

21:44.678 --> 21:47.879
and that bastard ran
off with every penny.

21:47.881 --> 21:50.148
Guy's name was Jason Sachs.

21:50.150 --> 21:52.617
I looked for that son of a bitch
for a few years,

21:52.619 --> 21:53.818
but he disappeared.

21:53.820 --> 21:54.953
But a couple months ago,

21:54.955 --> 21:56.588
I catch this
“behind the scenes” clip

21:56.590 --> 21:57.956
of the Air Races on YouTube,

21:57.958 --> 21:59.891
and in the background
there he was--

21:59.893 --> 22:01.226
the guy that ripped me off.

22:01.228 --> 22:02.827
He's wearing the...
the Shadow Baron outfit,

22:02.829 --> 22:04.095
but he had his helmet off.

22:04.097 --> 22:05.597
So I did some digging,

22:05.599 --> 22:07.699
confirmed his name
was Jason Sachs.

22:07.701 --> 22:11.369
So I flew over here and
tracked him down to his hotel.

22:11.371 --> 22:12.437
And that's where you
confronted him.

22:12.439 --> 22:13.538
All right, what'd he say?

22:13.540 --> 22:15.573
Not much,
'cause he didn't have to.

22:15.575 --> 22:18.409
'Cause he wasn't the Jason Sachs
who ripped me off.

22:18.411 --> 22:20.178
So you see
this guy in a clip,

22:20.180 --> 22:22.747
he looks exactly like
the guy that ripped you off,

22:22.749 --> 22:24.849
he's got the same name,
but it's... it's not him?

22:24.851 --> 22:28.052
They were dead ringers
except when it came to height.

22:28.054 --> 22:31.823
Two guys with the
same name, same face?

22:31.825 --> 22:33.958
Wh-What are the odds
of that, right?

22:36.363 --> 22:38.296
Just tell Governor Mahoe
I need to see her

22:38.298 --> 22:41.199
as soon as she's back
in the office, please.

22:41.201 --> 22:44.035
Yes. No, it is time-sensitive.

22:45.605 --> 22:48.206
You know what? Uh...

22:49.209 --> 22:51.209
Forget it. Thank you.

23:02.322 --> 23:03.621
Excuse me, Tani?

23:03.623 --> 23:06.791
Could I see you in my office,
please, for a sec?

23:06.793 --> 23:08.092
Yeah.

23:16.336 --> 23:17.435
Hi.
Hi.

23:17.437 --> 23:18.469
What's up?

23:18.471 --> 23:19.637
You want
to explain this?

23:19.639 --> 23:21.239
Oh, my God.
Is that the trim tab?

23:21.241 --> 23:22.206
It is.

23:22.208 --> 23:24.475
Great.
Yeah.

23:24.477 --> 23:27.545
You know how
it got on my desk?

23:27.547 --> 23:29.180
You're saying it was just here
when you came in?

23:29.182 --> 23:30.448
Uh-huh.

23:30.450 --> 23:32.050
That's so weird.

23:32.052 --> 23:33.251
It is, isn't it?

23:33.253 --> 23:34.852
Yeah.
Very weird.

23:34.854 --> 23:37.221
So you have no idea
how it got here?

23:37.223 --> 23:38.389
I don't know.

23:38.391 --> 23:39.590
But, um...

23:39.592 --> 23:42.327
don't look a gift horse
in the mouth, right?

23:43.196 --> 23:44.595
Right.

23:45.432 --> 23:46.464
Okay.

23:46.466 --> 23:47.665
Is there anything else?

23:47.667 --> 23:49.100
No. Do me a favor, will you?

23:49.102 --> 23:51.235
Take this down
to the crime lab, and...

23:51.237 --> 23:52.737
see what they can tell us.

23:52.739 --> 23:54.706
Okay, yeah. Will do.

23:54.708 --> 23:57.041
Hey, Tani?

23:57.043 --> 24:00.578
You're fitting in
just fine around here.

24:00.580 --> 24:02.680
Mahalo.

24:11.658 --> 24:14.058
Okay, so check this out.

24:14.060 --> 24:17.428
See that discoloration
on the tab?

24:17.430 --> 24:19.564
That's fresh paint right there.

24:19.566 --> 24:22.467
Now, see these grooves?

24:22.469 --> 24:24.469
Those were made
a couple of days ago.

24:24.471 --> 24:25.903
Okay, so what...
what does it all mean?

24:25.905 --> 24:27.672
All right, these
screw threadings,

24:27.674 --> 24:30.274
they've been ground
down to almost nothing.

24:30.276 --> 24:32.343
Now, normally, it would be
due to wear and tear,

24:32.345 --> 24:33.378
but these markings,

24:33.380 --> 24:34.512
they're too precise.

24:34.514 --> 24:36.247
This was done with a tool
of some kind.

24:36.249 --> 24:37.682
And then with
the paint,

24:37.684 --> 24:39.484
whoever did this

24:39.486 --> 24:41.519
was trying to cover up
the work they did.

24:41.521 --> 24:42.854
Right, so you're saying
that somebody

24:42.856 --> 24:44.188
tampered with the screws,

24:44.190 --> 24:45.990
loosening them
so that the trim tab

24:45.992 --> 24:47.558
would come off
during the practice run.

24:47.560 --> 24:49.160
Somebody wanted to make sure

24:49.162 --> 24:51.062
this was Jason's last flight.

25:00.373 --> 25:01.939
What the hell is this?

25:01.941 --> 25:04.208
Agent Callaghan.

25:04.210 --> 25:05.877
You're under arrest

25:05.879 --> 25:08.379
for obstruction of justice.

25:10.683 --> 25:12.116
After you.

25:28.322 --> 25:30.822
You tried to cover up
what really happened.

25:30.824 --> 25:32.390
That's a... that's
a serious offense.

25:32.392 --> 25:33.792
You understand that, right?

25:33.794 --> 25:36.494
We have a difference of opinion
over what happened.

25:36.496 --> 25:38.263
You say it was sabotage.

25:38.265 --> 25:39.664
I don't agree.

25:39.666 --> 25:41.032
That's hardly
a cover-up.

25:41.034 --> 25:43.201
Okay. Tani, why don't you
tell him what we know.

25:43.203 --> 25:47.739
Sure. So, we looked
into Hammerade's financials,

25:47.741 --> 25:50.241
and it turns out that they
were paying a lot of money

25:50.243 --> 25:52.577
to an anonymous shell company
in the Virgin Islands.

25:52.579 --> 25:56.314
That same shell also
controlled a trust in Bermuda.

25:56.316 --> 25:59.117
A trust that linked
back to you.

25:59.119 --> 26:01.353
And so those payments,
they started

26:01.355 --> 26:02.721
back in the fall of 2010,

26:02.723 --> 26:07.292
which was the same time
that the NTSB assigned you

26:07.294 --> 26:09.427
to oversee Hammerade's races.

26:09.429 --> 26:10.562
So, what's the deal?

26:10.564 --> 26:12.497
Hammerade keeps you
on a retainer, and in turn,

26:12.499 --> 26:13.698
you squash anything
that comes up

26:13.700 --> 26:15.266
that's bad for the brand?
Is that right?

26:15.268 --> 26:17.135
Like, for example,

26:17.137 --> 26:18.169
a pilot's sabotaged plane

26:18.171 --> 26:19.938
going down
during a practice run.

26:19.940 --> 26:22.941
Why-why you smiling?

26:22.943 --> 26:24.509
Yeah, you should be

26:24.511 --> 26:25.744
proud of yourself.
You just tried

26:25.746 --> 26:27.846
to screw over a widow
and her child to save

26:27.848 --> 26:29.981
a multi-million-dollar
company a PR headache.

26:29.983 --> 26:31.082
Well done.

26:31.084 --> 26:32.851
Okay.

26:32.853 --> 26:35.353
There are a lot of people
involved in this

26:35.355 --> 26:37.188
who are guilty of something,
Commander.

26:37.190 --> 26:38.857
Okay.

26:38.859 --> 26:41.459
Someone sabotaged
Jason Sachs's plane.

26:41.461 --> 26:44.796
Isaiah Phillips
failed to catch it.

26:45.899 --> 26:47.465
I covered it up.

26:48.368 --> 26:51.403
But let's not
forget your team.

26:51.405 --> 26:53.705
Go on.

26:53.707 --> 26:56.374
You're in possession
of one trim tab--

26:56.376 --> 27:00.311
a piece of evidence
in a federal investigation.

27:00.313 --> 27:03.081
Evidence that was
illegally seized

27:03.083 --> 27:04.716
from a federal
facility

27:04.718 --> 27:07.252
by someone connected
to your task force.

27:07.254 --> 27:12.323
You really think that there
won't be a fallout from that?

27:12.325 --> 27:15.093
See, you try to
bring me down,

27:15.095 --> 27:17.128
and I'll make sure our agency

27:17.130 --> 27:20.131
holds every member
of Five-O responsible

27:20.133 --> 27:22.367
for interfering
with a government inquiry.

27:22.369 --> 27:23.668
Okay, you done?

27:23.670 --> 27:25.036
Good.

27:25.038 --> 27:28.373
That trim tab was on my desk
when I walked into my office.

27:28.375 --> 27:29.874
How it got there, I don't know.

27:29.876 --> 27:31.276
Really?

27:31.278 --> 27:32.710
Yeah.

27:32.712 --> 27:34.379
And-and who, pray tell,
left it there?

27:34.381 --> 27:35.713
The-the evidence fairy?

27:35.715 --> 27:37.015
Maybe.

27:38.151 --> 27:39.651
You really expect my people

27:39.653 --> 27:41.319
to believe
you didn't steal it?

27:41.321 --> 27:43.955
Yes, I do.

27:43.957 --> 27:45.457
Because that's the truth.

27:45.459 --> 27:47.091
Ain't that right, Tani?

27:47.093 --> 27:49.060
Yes, sir.

28:00.207 --> 28:02.173
Norman Andrews'
story checks out.

28:02.175 --> 28:06.444
It seems he was indeed scammed
by a different Jason Sachs.

28:07.347 --> 28:09.981
So Norman Andrews
is not our killer.

28:09.983 --> 28:11.049
That is correct.

28:11.051 --> 28:13.218
But something
was kind of eating at me,

28:13.220 --> 28:15.753
so I had Jerry
dig a little deeper.

28:15.755 --> 28:19.224
That Jason Sachs--
Norman Andrews' Jason Sachs--

28:19.226 --> 28:21.526
was killed in a car accident
six years ago.

28:21.528 --> 28:23.628
Okay.

28:23.630 --> 28:24.662
All right. Go on.

28:24.664 --> 28:26.431
This got me
to thinking.

28:26.433 --> 28:29.367
Here we have a pilot
who was about the closest thing

28:29.369 --> 28:32.704
to a real-life Racer X
of the sky,

28:32.706 --> 28:37.175
and this pilot also has
the name and the likeness

28:37.177 --> 28:39.077
of a dead guy?

28:39.079 --> 28:41.479
I don't think so.

28:41.481 --> 28:45.316
Anyway, I had Noelani
run our Jason Sachs's prints,

28:45.318 --> 28:47.252
and guess what.

28:47.254 --> 28:50.255
Jason Sachs is as big an alias
as “the Shadow Baron.”

28:50.257 --> 28:52.790
Because, according to CODIS,

28:52.792 --> 28:57.095
our Jason Sachs's real name
is Luke Nixon.

28:58.999 --> 29:01.165
Okay, so our victim,

29:01.167 --> 29:03.001
aka Luke Nixon,

29:03.003 --> 29:04.936
stole the late
Jason Sachs' identity.

29:04.938 --> 29:06.304
Is that right?

29:06.306 --> 29:09.140
I mean, well, it's not like
he was using it, but yeah.

29:09.142 --> 29:11.009
It looks like our
victim was really

29:11.011 --> 29:13.711
trying to hide from something.
Or someone.

29:13.713 --> 29:17.549
Either way, I think this whole
thing's connected to the DEA.

29:17.551 --> 29:19.117
Why?
Because the DEA

29:19.119 --> 29:21.586
arrested Luke Nixon in 2009.

29:21.588 --> 29:23.221
Problem with that is,
we don't know

29:23.223 --> 29:24.622
what the hell happened
after that

29:24.624 --> 29:25.924
because the file is sealed.

29:25.926 --> 29:28.159
Then we need to get it unsealed.
I'll put in a call.

29:28.161 --> 29:29.794
Hopefully there's
something in there

29:29.796 --> 29:32.263
that can tell us why somebody
would want this guy dead.

29:32.265 --> 29:33.998
What do you want to
do with this guy?

29:34.968 --> 29:36.668
Well, we can't hold him.

29:36.670 --> 29:38.803
But I do know some people
in Washington

29:38.805 --> 29:41.439
who might be very interested
in his financial records.

29:43.310 --> 29:45.510
Luke Nixon, aka Jason Sachs.

29:45.512 --> 29:47.178
Born 1981 in
Amarillo, Texas.

29:47.180 --> 29:49.380
He was caught flying
drug shipments

29:49.382 --> 29:52.183
for the Maldonado
Cartel in 2009.

29:52.185 --> 29:53.985
DEA gave him a choice:

29:53.987 --> 29:56.087
to either go to prison
or turn informant.

29:56.089 --> 29:58.122
I'm guessing he opted
for the latter.

29:58.124 --> 29:59.557
Yep.

29:59.559 --> 30:02.126
This is Juan Camilo, the
cartel's Grand Poobah.

30:02.128 --> 30:03.695
Now, DEA and the Mexican
Federal Police

30:03.697 --> 30:05.830
have been trying
to take this guy down for years.

30:05.832 --> 30:08.266
But Luke was
the only CI they had

30:08.268 --> 30:09.634
that could get
close to him.

30:09.636 --> 30:11.669
In fact, Juan took a
real shine to Luke.

30:11.671 --> 30:13.037
Treated him like blood.

30:13.039 --> 30:16.407
Now, according to his file,
after 18 months of snitching,

30:16.409 --> 30:18.843
Luke begged the DEA
to let him go,

30:18.845 --> 30:20.078
but they refused.

30:20.080 --> 30:21.479
I'm guessing,
when he figured out

30:21.481 --> 30:23.915
there was no other way out,
he decided to cut and run.

30:23.917 --> 30:25.516
Is that right?
Yeah, but he wasn't alone.

30:25.518 --> 30:28.353
He took Juan Camilo's
only daughter with him.

30:28.355 --> 30:30.021
Uh-oh.

30:30.023 --> 30:32.924
Whoa.
That's Jason... <i>Luke's</i>

30:32.926 --> 30:34.125
widow, Elena.

30:34.127 --> 30:35.259
Yeah. It's kind of

30:35.261 --> 30:36.894
an epic Romeo and Juliet story.

30:36.896 --> 30:39.897
DEA mole falls in love
with the drug lord's daughter,

30:39.899 --> 30:41.966
and they take off together
and go into hiding

30:41.968 --> 30:44.035
from both the good guys
and the bad.

30:44.037 --> 30:46.304
Okay, so apparently that story
that she gave us this morning

30:46.306 --> 30:48.406
was not anywhere near
as interesting as the truth.

30:48.408 --> 30:49.540
Well, the details
have changed,

30:49.542 --> 30:50.908
but the-the circumstances
are similar.

30:50.910 --> 30:52.110
All right,
so we got a guy

30:52.112 --> 30:53.845
who only knows
how to do one thing.

30:53.847 --> 30:56.114
Lucky for him, he ends up
landing himself a gig

30:56.116 --> 30:58.016
where he can keep
doing it on the low.

30:58.018 --> 30:59.884
Right, and those races,
they go all over the world,

30:59.886 --> 31:01.052
so he gets to keep moving.

31:01.054 --> 31:02.387
It's like he's hiding
in plain sight.

31:02.389 --> 31:03.755
Yeah, I guess he didn't
move fast enough.

31:03.757 --> 31:04.956
They caught up to him.

31:04.958 --> 31:06.958
So I'm thinking somebody
connected to the cartel

31:06.960 --> 31:09.327
must have seen that video
of Luke online somewhere, right?

31:09.329 --> 31:11.496
So they come out here,
they mess with his plane,

31:11.498 --> 31:14.265
killing not only the guy
that ratted on 'em,

31:14.267 --> 31:16.401
but the guy who ran away
with the boss's daughter.

31:16.403 --> 31:18.436
But the one thing
I can't figure out--

31:18.438 --> 31:20.772
these people, they're...
they're badass drug lords.

31:20.774 --> 31:22.940
Why waste time
sabotaging a plane

31:22.942 --> 31:24.809
when they can just put
a bullet in him?

31:24.811 --> 31:26.144
I don't know.

31:26.146 --> 31:27.512
It seems like it's obvious.

31:27.514 --> 31:29.180
Attract too much attention.

31:29.182 --> 31:32.083
Yeah, but it's still a big risk
killing him that way. Why?

31:55.742 --> 31:57.408
Clear!

32:04.584 --> 32:06.484
Clear.

32:10.924 --> 32:12.690
Well, if you're right,
sabotaging the plane

32:12.692 --> 32:13.873
wasn't the only reason
they came here.

32:13.897 --> 32:14.593
No.

32:14.594 --> 32:18.429
They came to take the boss's
daughter and grandson back.

32:28.477 --> 32:31.442
Elena and Tomás are probably
on a boat or a plane

32:31.445 --> 32:33.278
back to Mexico right now.

32:33.280 --> 32:35.380
Jerry, what do you got?

32:35.382 --> 32:36.982
Inspector General
Miguel Cortines

32:36.984 --> 32:38.216
of the Federal Police

32:38.218 --> 32:39.851
on the line,
just like you asked.

32:39.853 --> 32:40.785
Good. Put him through.

32:40.787 --> 32:41.853
Hello.

32:41.855 --> 32:43.788
Señor Cortines, this is

32:43.790 --> 32:44.923
Commander Steve McGarrett.

32:44.925 --> 32:46.591
Yes. What can I do
for you, Commander?

32:46.593 --> 32:47.692
We need your assistance, sir.

32:47.694 --> 32:49.327
We know you must have
the Maldonado Cartel

32:49.329 --> 32:51.062
under surveillance.
Do you have any wires up

32:51.064 --> 32:52.964
on Juan Camilo himself?

32:52.966 --> 32:53.899
Commander, you must understand,

32:53.901 --> 32:55.333
I can neither confirm
nor deny...

32:55.335 --> 32:56.968
Sir, I understand this
is highly irregular,

32:56.970 --> 32:59.704
but we have a hostage
situation on our hands.

32:59.706 --> 33:01.306
We believe members
of the cartel have abducted

33:01.308 --> 33:02.774
Juan Camilo's estranged
daughter Elena

33:02.776 --> 33:04.776
and her son Tomás
with the intent

33:04.778 --> 33:06.244
to transport them
back to Mexico.

33:06.246 --> 33:08.747
I can tell you we've heard
no chatter about that.

33:08.749 --> 33:10.715
All right, well, can
you at least tell us

33:10.717 --> 33:12.617
if Camilo has placed
any outgoing calls

33:12.619 --> 33:15.754
to numbers in the 808 area code
of the United States

33:15.756 --> 33:17.722
in the last 24 hours?

33:19.459 --> 33:21.593
Jerry, I lose him?
Is he still on the line?

33:21.595 --> 33:23.295
I'm here, Commander.

33:23.297 --> 33:24.963
All right.

33:24.965 --> 33:27.065
Give me ten minutes.
I'll see what I can find out.

33:27.067 --> 33:29.501
Thank you.

33:38.879 --> 33:40.378
We're not going back.

33:41.281 --> 33:42.814
You don't have a choice.

33:42.816 --> 33:45.917
Your father searched for you
and your husband for years.

33:45.919 --> 33:47.519
He just wants you home.

33:47.521 --> 33:49.454
And he wants
to meet his grandson.

33:52.092 --> 33:54.893
You have no idea how much
you've disappointed him, Elena.

34:00.968 --> 34:02.968
Time to go.

34:30.429 --> 34:32.264
Turn around.
On the ground.

34:44.978 --> 34:46.177
You all right?

34:48.047 --> 34:49.347
Thank you.

34:49.349 --> 34:50.882
Yeah. Come on.

34:50.884 --> 34:52.583
Come on.

35:06.366 --> 35:07.766
Hard to believe he could hide

35:07.768 --> 35:09.934
that kind of history
all those years.

35:12.439 --> 35:14.039
Thank you.

35:14.041 --> 35:15.206
For looking
into the crash

35:15.208 --> 35:16.808
and finding out
the truth.

35:16.810 --> 35:17.976
Yeah.
Yeah.

35:17.978 --> 35:20.879
I know the rest of
his crew is grateful.

35:22.115 --> 35:24.416
NTSB's gonna issue
a new statement,

35:24.418 --> 35:25.617
just so you know,

35:25.619 --> 35:27.719
stating that the, uh,
cause of the crash

35:27.721 --> 35:29.154
was malicious tampering.

35:29.156 --> 35:30.922
When that happens,

35:30.924 --> 35:33.892
Elena should get the full
insurance payout, right?

35:33.894 --> 35:36.394
My guess is she's gonna have
to fight for it.

35:36.396 --> 35:37.929
Jason...

35:37.931 --> 35:40.699
Luke had that policy
under “Jason Sachs.”

35:40.701 --> 35:43.201
Insurance company's probably
going to say it's fraud

35:43.203 --> 35:45.437
and use that as an excuse
to avoid paying.

35:45.439 --> 35:47.605
What about Hammerade?

35:47.607 --> 35:49.574
I mean, Th-they gotta give
the family something, right?

35:49.576 --> 35:51.276
Not according to the contract.

35:51.278 --> 35:52.977
Those guys got
their asses covered.

35:52.979 --> 35:54.913
We don't race, they don't pay.

35:57.351 --> 36:00.018
We got a backup plane,
but without a pilot,

36:00.020 --> 36:01.486
we'll have to pull out.

36:01.488 --> 36:03.588
You got another plane?

36:03.590 --> 36:04.756
Yeah.

36:04.758 --> 36:06.224
Wait a minute--
all you gotta do

36:06.226 --> 36:07.659
is-is get that plane in the air?

36:07.661 --> 36:09.861
And Elena and Tomás will
get a little something.

36:09.863 --> 36:11.796
Won't be a huge payout,
but it'll definitely help.

36:11.798 --> 36:15.133
Hold on. Can you, um...
Can... can we talk?

36:15.135 --> 36:17.068
Can I talk to you
for a second, please?

36:17.070 --> 36:18.536
Sure.

36:31.351 --> 36:33.051
Steve?

36:34.254 --> 36:35.620
Steve.
Oh, my God.

37:01.982 --> 37:03.214
Oh!

37:07.087 --> 37:08.319
Oh...

37:08.321 --> 37:10.588
Oh, this guy.

37:12.692 --> 37:14.259
This guy.

37:17.130 --> 37:18.797
Buddy, how you doing?
You all right?

37:18.799 --> 37:20.398
Yeah.

37:20.400 --> 37:22.767
That was almost unpleasant.

37:22.769 --> 37:25.437
That was definitely
almost unpleasant. Yes.

37:25.439 --> 37:26.838
Whew.

37:26.840 --> 37:28.940
Wait a minute. Were you
worried about me, Danny?

37:28.942 --> 37:32.444
Just put the plane
on the ground, please, maniac.

37:32.446 --> 37:34.112
Hey, I'm sorry.

37:34.114 --> 37:35.547
Did you just call me “Maverick”?

37:35.549 --> 37:36.781
'Cause if you did, that's, like,

37:36.783 --> 37:38.283
the great compliment
you've ever given me.

37:38.285 --> 37:39.417
Thank you. I love you.

37:39.419 --> 37:41.019
Land the plane, you idiot.

37:41.021 --> 37:43.588
Copy that.
Permission to buzz the tower?

37:49.095 --> 37:50.995
Whoa!

38:02.108 --> 38:04.075
I feel the need.

38:04.077 --> 38:06.845
The need for Steve.

38:08.315 --> 38:09.914
I just said that

38:09.916 --> 38:11.549
out loud, didn't I?
Oh, yeah.

38:11.551 --> 38:13.184
You're a kiss-ass.

38:52.692 --> 38:54.225
Hey.

38:55.262 --> 38:56.294
How'd I do?

38:56.296 --> 38:57.762
Uh, you know.

38:57.764 --> 38:58.730
Not too bad.

38:58.732 --> 38:59.864
Very respectable.

38:59.866 --> 39:02.267
Cool. How respectable?

39:02.269 --> 39:04.102
Came in 12th.

39:04.104 --> 39:05.503
12th?

39:05.505 --> 39:07.372
Out of how many?

39:07.374 --> 39:08.606
12.

39:08.608 --> 39:10.275
Victory's in the effort.

39:10.277 --> 39:11.676
Wait a minute.

39:11.678 --> 39:13.278
12th out of 12?

39:14.314 --> 39:16.047
What about without the...
I almost crashed.

39:16.049 --> 39:18.650
You take that time away,
you do that math...?

39:18.652 --> 39:20.852
Yeah, but it's still 12th,
though.

39:21.788 --> 39:22.887
Chin up, baby.

39:22.889 --> 39:23.888
Got this bad boy in the air.

39:23.890 --> 39:25.215
That's all we needed.
Thank you.

39:25.216 --> 39:26.308
Nice going, Ace.

39:26.332 --> 39:28.332
12th. Dead last?
Dead last?

39:28.962 --> 39:30.161
- Dead last.
- Yeah, dead last.

39:30.163 --> 39:32.030
It's better than
dead period, right?

39:32.032 --> 39:33.364
You know what? These
guys, these flyboys,

39:33.366 --> 39:35.233
they do this for a living.
You thought you were gonna...

39:35.235 --> 39:37.201
I mean, you're you, and they're
them. You know what I mean?

39:37.203 --> 39:38.403
Come on. Maverick,
I'll buy you a...

39:38.405 --> 39:39.571
I'll buy you
beers. Come on.

39:39.573 --> 39:41.272
But it seemed...
it seemed so fast when I was...

39:41.274 --> 39:42.640
Very, very fast.
It did, right?

39:42.642 --> 39:44.909
Ooph.
It felt very fast.

39:46.046 --> 39:49.514
♪ I put the pedal down ♪

39:49.516 --> 39:55.353
♪ 'Cause I want to go fast ♪

39:55.355 --> 39:57.188
♪ 'Cause I want to go fast... ♪

39:57.190 --> 39:58.456
You the man.

39:58.458 --> 39:59.891
You did so good, McGarrett.

39:59.893 --> 40:01.259
Thanks, buddy.
You didn't over-g.

40:01.261 --> 40:03.995
Tight vertical
turn maneuvers.

40:03.997 --> 40:05.330
Not bad for an amateur.

40:05.332 --> 40:07.165
Thanks, buddy.

40:07.167 --> 40:08.433
Yeah, I've been thinking,

40:08.435 --> 40:10.969
if I ever get tired
of being cooped up

40:10.971 --> 40:12.236
in that bunker all day,

40:12.238 --> 40:14.606
maybe I could be one
of those Hammerade racers.

40:14.608 --> 40:18.309
You know, travel the world,
have a cool alias like...

40:18.311 --> 40:19.944
Conspira-Soar.

40:19.946 --> 40:21.512
Conspira-Soar.
What do you think?

40:21.514 --> 40:22.647
Catchy.

40:22.649 --> 40:24.182
If you like dinosaurs.

40:24.184 --> 40:25.583
No, it's not a dinosaur name.

40:25.585 --> 40:28.453
It's a hybrid between
“conspiracy” and “soaring.”

40:28.455 --> 40:30.121
You know, never mind.

40:30.123 --> 40:31.556
Yeah, maybe stick to

40:31.558 --> 40:33.124
Bigfoot sightings there,
Conspira-Soar.

40:33.126 --> 40:34.726
You know what, though?

40:34.728 --> 40:37.662
Your new catchphrase,
it's perfect.

40:37.664 --> 40:38.730
What?

40:38.732 --> 40:42.133
I feel the need,
the need for Steve.

40:43.169 --> 40:45.003
You heard about that?

40:45.005 --> 40:45.937
Everyone heard about that.

40:45.939 --> 40:47.305
That's okay.

40:47.307 --> 40:48.806
Boss man's your hero.

40:51.911 --> 40:53.077
Where you going?

40:53.079 --> 40:54.212
Go flog myself.

40:54.214 --> 40:55.446
Oh, perfect.
On your way back,

40:55.448 --> 40:56.447
bring me another beer.

40:56.449 --> 40:59.250
So, uh, did you
ever find out

40:59.252 --> 41:01.319
who put that trim tab
on your desk?

41:01.321 --> 41:03.621
No. No, I never did.
I never did.

41:03.623 --> 41:06.691
I guess it's one of those,
uh, mysteries that are just

41:06.693 --> 41:08.559
gonna need to remain...
Yeah.

41:08.561 --> 41:10.662
...unsolved.

41:10.664 --> 41:13.197
Yeah.

41:13.199 --> 41:15.166
What was that about?

41:15.168 --> 41:17.135
Tell you later.
All right.

41:17.137 --> 41:19.470
Now you and I have even
more to talk about.

41:19.472 --> 41:21.406
We do.
Yeah.

41:22.709 --> 41:25.109
You know, something
I gotta do first, though.

41:25.111 --> 41:27.045
Yeah?

41:52.806 --> 41:54.138
Hey.

41:54.140 --> 41:55.940
Hey.

41:58.511 --> 42:01.646
So, me getting you
that metal thing--

42:01.648 --> 42:03.715
did it make a difference?

42:03.717 --> 42:05.983
Yeah.

42:05.985 --> 42:08.419
Yeah, we... we closed the case.

42:11.458 --> 42:13.791
So we're even now?

42:14.627 --> 42:17.228
Yeah, we're even.

42:18.064 --> 42:19.697
Good.

42:27.507 --> 42:29.774
Hey, sis. You eat?

42:32.378 --> 42:33.878
What?

42:33.880 --> 42:35.446
I was thinking about
going to Rainbow's

42:35.448 --> 42:36.848
for a bite.

42:36.850 --> 42:38.583
You hungry?

42:40.053 --> 42:41.419
Yeah.

42:41.421 --> 42:43.187
Yeah, I'm starving.

42:43.475 --> 42:45.075
Cool.
