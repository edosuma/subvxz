AGAINST EVIL SPIRITS."

11:05.331 --> 11:08.084
- YEAH, I JUST THINK IT'S
GONNA TAKE MORE THAN A NECKLACE

11:08.167 --> 11:10.086
TO PROTECT US FROM THIS CURSE.

11:13.756 --> 11:15.049
FABIAN.

11:15.132 --> 11:16.133
COME LOOK AT THIS!

11:18.844 --> 11:21.389
- FABIAN, COME LOOK AT THIS!

11:28.437 --> 11:31.107
SO WE FOUND
OUR HIDDEN TUNNEL SYSTEM.

11:31.190 --> 11:32.858
IT'S BEHIND THE BOOKSHELF.

11:32.942 --> 11:34.485
- WE JUST NEED
TO TRIGGER THE OPENING,

11:34.568 --> 11:36.612
SO I WAS THINKING WE'D GO
BACK DOWN THERE LATER TONIGHT,

11:36.695 --> 11:37.988
OR SOONER.

11:38.072 --> 11:42.993
- WHOA, TRUDY, HOW MANY PEOPLE
ARE ACTUALLY LEAVING?

11:43.077 --> 11:45.079

I'VE BEEN OFFERED A JOB.

11:50.876 --> 11:53.963
ASSISTANT CURATOR

WHO DOESN'T THINK IT'S FUNNY

12:01.679 --> 12:03.848

SO...MICK,

12:17.194 --> 12:20.531
ONE MORE DAY
AND IT'S, "G'DAY, AUSTRALIA."

12:20.614 --> 12:21.240

12:36.839 --> 12:38.841
WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO
FOR HIS SEND-OFF.

12:38.924 --> 12:42.136
- I'VE GOT ENOUGH FOOD
IN THERE TO FEED A MICK.

12:42.219 --> 12:43.345
- I'M THINKING...

12:43.429 --> 12:46.265
OPERATION "MAKE IT SEEM
LIKE WE DON'T CARE,

12:46.348 --> 12:48.601
AND THEN WE JUMP OUT
AND TELL HIM WE LOVE HIM."

12:48.684 --> 12:50.102
[all agreeing]

12:51.020 --> 12:52.396
- SO, POP QUIZ.

12:52.480 --> 12:54.190
IS IT JUST A COINCIDENCE

12:54.273 --> 12:55.858
THAT YOU BROKE UP WITH MICK

12:55.941 --> 12:59.278
AT EXACTLY THE RIGHT MOMENT
TO MAKE HIM FOLLOW HIS DREAMS?

12:59.361 --> 13:01.780
- PASS.
MY TURN.

13:01.864 --> 13:03.282
WHEN ARE YOU GOING TO HELP POPPY
TRACK DOWN YOUR DAD?

SHE NEEDS YOU.

13:05.284 --> 13:06.702
- PASS.

13:06.785 --> 13:08.704
- YOUR DAD CLEARLY HAS STUFF
HE NEEDS TO SAY TO YOU.

13:08.787 --> 13:09.997
- I SHOULD BE TAKING NOTES.

13:10.080 --> 13:12.208
YOU'RE CLEARLY THE AUTHORITY
ON HONESTY.

13:12.291 --> 13:15.794
- ME AND MICK
HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH YOU.

13:17.213 --> 13:17.963
OH, AND ANOTHER THING,

13:18.047 --> 13:19.465
YEAH, MAYBE I AM INTERFERING,

13:19.548 --> 13:23.385
BUT I JUST WANT TO STOP YOU
DOING SOMETHING YOU'LL REGRET.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.679

13:30.100 --> 13:31.769
BUT I GUESS YOU KNOW
HOW THAT FEELS.

13:31.852 --> 13:33.562
- WE'RE SUPPOSED TO BE FRIENDS.

13:33.646 --> 13:38.067
I MEAN, IT JUST SEEMS
LIKE SHE DOESN'T WANT TO KNOW.

13:38.150 --> 13:40.819
YOU KNOW, THE SOONER I'M OUT
OF HERE, THE BETTER.

13:43.322 --> 13:46.158
- TRUDY WILL BE
IN THE LIBRARY, SO WE CAN--

13:46.242 --> 13:47.743
OH.

13:47.826 --> 13:50.454

MICK'S LEAVING PARTY.

13:50.538 --> 13:53.082
BUT WE'LL NEVER GET PAST.

13:53.165 --> 13:54.542
- SHAME.

13:54.625 --> 13:56.585
LET'S GO CHOOSE WHAT TO WEAR.

13:56.669 --> 13:59.171
- OR WE CAN BORROW
THE CELLAR KEY

13:59.255 --> 14:00.589
FROM VICTOR'S OFFICE.

14:00.673 --> 14:02.007
IT MIGHT BE
OUR ONLY CHANCE TODAY.

14:02.091 --> 14:03.092
- NINA, NO!

14:51.265 --> 14:52.474
YOU'RE NOT LEAVING NOW,

14:52.558 --> 14:55.603

AN EARLIER TRAIN.

14:55.686 --> 14:57.187
I HATE GOOD-BYES.

14:57.271 --> 14:59.315
