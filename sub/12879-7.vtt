And to use an old Englandian
saying, I'd love to stay,

08:42.230 --> 08:43.188
but it's Brendoni time!

08:43.272 --> 08:44.065
You sure?

08:44.148 --> 08:45.274
I think there's a
documentary about

08:45.358 --> 08:46.901
{\an1}to start on glacial
migration.

08:46.984 --> 08:48.277
{\an1}We could just
kick back--

08:48.361 --> 08:50.988
Ooh, yeah dude, that
sounds amazing.

08:51.072 --> 08:51.989
<i>We should do that.</i>

08:52.073 --> 08:52.907
Yeah!

08:57.870 --> 09:00.248
No.

09:00.331 --> 09:01.749
No.

09:01.832 --> 09:03.084
Lies!

09:03.167 --> 09:04.961
The Napoleonic
wars were lies?

09:05.044 --> 09:06.754
No, they happened.

09:06.837 --> 09:08.589
But this textbook leaves
out the romance.

09:08.673 --> 09:11.008
All of the intrigue.

09:11.092 --> 09:12.134
Not to mention--

09:12.218 --> 09:14.637
One very brave
dog who played

09:14.720 --> 09:18.266
the greatest
role of all.

09:18.349 --> 09:19.141
Mr. Oswald?

09:19.225 --> 09:20.935
{\an1}I don't know how long
you've been a sub,

09:21.018 --> 09:23.646

actually have to do anything.

09:23.729 --> 09:24.939
Just put in a video

09:25.022 --> 09:25.773
and clap some chalkboard
erasers together.

09:25.856 --> 09:28.025
{\an1}Whatever teachers
do for fun.

09:28.109 --> 09:29.110
Nonsense.

09:29.193 --> 09:33.823

best of my ability,

09:33.906 --> 09:38.286
regardless of how
unpleasant I may find it.

09:38.369 --> 09:40.329
Now, this book's
greatest mistake

09:40.413 --> 09:42.665
<i>is to totally discount</i>
<i>the contributions</i>

09:42.748 --> 09:44.292
of the Second Kingdom.

09:44.375 --> 09:48.337
Why, I myself poked Napoleon
in his hand with my rapier.

09:48.421 --> 09:49.630
Gaving him gangrene.

09:49.714 --> 09:53.801
This led directly
to his downfall.

09:53.884 --> 09:55.011
Mr. Oswald.

09:55.094 --> 09:57.346
Alas, she speaks!

09:57.430 --> 10:00.349
You really want us to believe
that you're over 200 years old?

10:00.433 --> 10:01.350
I know.

10:01.434 --> 10:03.728
When I don't look
a day over 185.

10:03.811 --> 10:04.854
Mr. Oswald--

10:04.937 --> 10:07.732
Uh uh, you have used up your
hand raising for today.

10:07.815 --> 10:12.194
Now I respect Napoleon
for his rise to power,

10:12.278 --> 10:14.697
even if he needed a
step-stool to do it.

10:14.780 --> 10:20.828
(laughing)

10:20.911 --> 10:23.080
This is my
little joke.

10:25.291 --> 10:26.709
You look terrible.

10:26.792 --> 10:28.044
I couldn't find Tristan
anywhere.

10:28.127 --> 10:28.836

10:28.919 --> 10:30.713
No, but it doesn't
matter, you're--

10:30.796 --> 10:31.922
Of course it
matters Morgan.

10:32.006 --> 10:34.216
If it didn't matter, I'd
still be in Athenia

10:34.300 --> 10:36.677

music with his armpits!

10:36.761 --> 10:38.095
Astral, you're sick.

10:38.179 --> 10:41.349
Sick people, or
fairies need rest.

10:41.432 --> 10:42.350

10:42.433 --> 10:43.726

But when we
got cut off--

10:52.485 --> 10:55.237
Yeah, I'm really sorry about
that, my phone just died.

10:55.321 --> 10:56.947
It's always so sad when
something dies.

10:57.031 --> 11:00.242
Well, you know it just needs
a charge and it will be fine.

11:00.326 --> 11:01.786
But before we
got cut off,

11:01.869 --> 11:03.913
I was wondering if maybe
you wanted to--

11:03.996 --> 11:05.289

You decided to
come back?

18:02.873 --> 18:04.875
Most people usually spread
that on something.

18:04.958 --> 18:06.502
Most people aren't Brendoni.

18:06.585 --> 18:08.670
Believe me, I've checked.

18:08.754 --> 18:11.507
By the way, I got
you something.

18:11.590 --> 18:12.716
Wow.

18:12.800 --> 18:15.511
A half-eaten taco
covered in mud.

18:15.594 --> 18:19.515
Some people might say I went
overboard, but for my friend,

18:19.598 --> 18:22.142
there's nothing's too much.

18:22.434 --> 18:23.519
Go on.

18:23.936 --> 18:25.521
Come on it's good.

18:27.898 --> 18:29.233
Ohh!

18:29.316 --> 18:31.235
Ghost pepper hot
sauce, huh?

18:33.153 --> 18:35.531
'Cause I care.

18:36.406 --> 18:37.658
Are you gonna
finish that?

Hey boys, how was
the day?

19:47.728 --> 19:48.729
Fine.

19:48.812 --> 19:49.563
Feeling better?

19:49.646 --> 19:50.939
A little.

19:51.023 --> 19:52.316
You're men of
many words.

19:52.399 --> 19:53.400
Whatever.

19:54.484 --> 19:56.778
You know what, I actually
am feeling a bit better.

19:56.862 --> 19:58.447
{\an1}It was probably
the resting nest.

19:58.530 --> 19:59.740
Or the soup.

19:59.823 --> 20:03.619
I hate to say it, but I think it
might have been the mud taco's.

20:03.702 --> 20:06.163
It was probably all my amazing
rubbing off on you.

20:06.246 --> 20:08.624
I'm gonna stick
with the mud tacos.

20:08.916 --> 20:11.835
I guess it's back to school
for both of us tomorrow.

20:11.919 --> 20:12.961
{\an1}Yeah.

20:13.045 --> 20:14.296

disappointed

I'm such a perfect
physical specimen,

20:16.882 --> 20:18.759

actually get sick.

20:19.051 --> 20:22.638

20:24.890 --> 20:26.975
I'll get the soup.

20:28.018 --> 20:29.478
Yeah.

20:29.561 --> 20:31.772
Hey, I was looking
for you all over today.

20:31.855 --> 20:35.984
I felt like I was running around
in a maze, like a, like a, huh.

20:36.068 --> 20:37.527
I can't think of a
metaphor.

20:37.611 --> 20:38.695
That's actually a simile.

20:38.779 --> 20:41.156
You wanted to ask
me something?

20:41.240 --> 20:44.159
I had a really fun time
in the gym the other day,

20:44.242 --> 20:47.162
and I was wondering if you
wanted to hang out sometime?

20:47.245 --> 20:48.747
What do I say?

20:49.039 --> 20:51.166
Astral, Are you
still there?

20:51.250 --> 20:55.003
Yeah, I say,
that's thumbs.

20:55.087 --> 20:56.129
Thumbs?

20:56.213 --> 20:57.631
I mean, no.

20:57.714 --> 20:59.383
No, you don't
want to hang?

20:59.466 --> 21:00.050
No!

21:00.133 --> 21:00.884
I mean, yes.

21:00.968 --> 21:02.427
I would like
to hang.

21:02.511 --> 21:03.553
With you.

21:03.637 --> 21:04.638
That'd be cool.

21:04.721 --> 21:07.599
Great, well I'll text you
and we'll figure it out.

21:07.683 --> 21:08.475
Cool.

See ya.

21:10.727 --> 21:13.730

21:13.814 --> 21:16.984
Well, that was both exhilarating
and exhausting.

21:17.067 --> 21:18.193
Yeah.

21:19.444 --> 21:22.364
Wait a minute, wait a minute,
