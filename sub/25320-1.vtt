01:57.724 --> 02:00.023
Today is the big day,
Alex.

02:03.696 --> 02:05.629
Think I'm ready.

02:05.631 --> 02:07.430
I think.

02:07.432 --> 02:11.368
But just in case, from
one Number 13 to another,

02:11.370 --> 02:13.069
got any tips for me?
Heh, heh.

02:13.071 --> 02:15.705
Are you talking
to your poster?

02:15.707 --> 02:17.842
You want a tip?

02:17.844 --> 02:20.578
Push-ups.

02:20.580 --> 02:21.979
One.

02:21.981 --> 02:24.848
Two. Three.

02:24.850 --> 02:29.520
Four. Five. Six. Seven.

02:29.522 --> 02:35.492
Eight. Nine. Ten. Eleven.

02:35.494 --> 02:37.461
You can stop now.

02:37.463 --> 02:39.629
Thirteen. Fourteen.

02:43.702 --> 02:45.568
Today's the big day!

02:45.570 --> 02:47.872
Yes, it is. The Michigan coach
is coming to meet

02:47.874 --> 02:50.640
Logan today after school.
They're talking scholarship.

02:50.642 --> 02:53.743
Yeah, okay, right, but aren't
you forgetting something else?

02:53.745 --> 02:57.814
- Is UCLA coming today, too? Uh...
- No, no, no, not about Logan,

02:57.816 --> 02:59.984
or Logan's football, about my...

02:59.986 --> 03:01.985
Excuse me. Has
anyone seen my keys?

03:01.987 --> 03:03.554
Go for Joe.

03:03.556 --> 03:04.722
Hello, Coach.

03:04.724 --> 03:06.456
- What?
- Alabama.

03:06.458 --> 03:07.457
Yes!

03:07.459 --> 03:09.026
Yes, sir?

03:09.028 --> 03:10.660
Can I get a ride today?

03:10.662 --> 03:12.796
Uh... Ooh. Hold on, honey.

03:12.798 --> 03:14.632
Hello?

03:14.634 --> 03:16.599
Clemson.

03:16.601 --> 03:18.169
- Uh, yes.
- Thank you very much, sir.

03:18.171 --> 03:19.937
Thank you so
much for calling.

03:19.939 --> 03:22.539
I'm gonna go move to Alaska
and join a cult.

03:22.541 --> 03:25.175
Oh, yes, we are so proud of him.
He's a great kid.

03:25.177 --> 03:27.745
Yes. Absolutely, coach.
Looking forward to it.

03:27.747 --> 03:29.747
You're gonna
ship my stuff, right?

03:29.749 --> 03:31.581
Seventy-six, 77, 78.

03:31.583 --> 03:33.450
Seventy-nine.

03:36.689 --> 03:38.855
And they totally
forgot about my tryout.

03:38.857 --> 03:41.124
Well your brother kinda
is the best quarterback

03:41.126 --> 03:42.492
this city's ever had.

03:42.494 --> 03:44.995
- Et tu, Grace?
- Kidding.

03:44.997 --> 03:47.063
I know something
that'll cheer you up.

03:47.065 --> 03:49.599
Have you seen the cute boy
that just moved here?

03:49.601 --> 03:51.670
And I heard he plays soccer.

03:57.677 --> 03:59.946
Hi, Ben!

04:01.780 --> 04:04.014
Ugh, Claire Bishop.

04:04.016 --> 04:06.916
That girl has
to have everything.

04:06.918 --> 04:09.822
Good luck today.
You've got this, Regs.

04:12.791 --> 04:14.427
What? Uh.

04:17.863 --> 04:19.632
Oh, no, no, no.

04:20.665 --> 04:23.100
You gotta be kidding me.

04:40.218 --> 04:42.151
For those of you
who don't know,

04:42.153 --> 04:44.754
I'm John Osbourne.

04:44.756 --> 04:48.792
Coach Oz.
The great and powerful.

04:48.794 --> 04:52.295
But with me, there's no man
behind the curtain.

04:52.297 --> 04:54.932
In your daughter's
soccer world,

04:54.934 --> 04:58.168
I'm all powerful.
All knowing.

04:58.170 --> 05:01.838
I wish I could say
welcome to Crush tryouts,

05:01.840 --> 05:03.973
but I'd be lying.

05:03.975 --> 05:08.211
Today's tryouts are a welcome
to a small number of you.

05:08.213 --> 05:11.682
And a wish you goodbye
to most.

05:11.684 --> 05:13.550
Even if you played
for me since

05:13.552 --> 05:16.286
you were 6 years old,

05:16.288 --> 05:17.887
today you could get cut.

05:17.889 --> 05:21.057
I do not play favorites.

05:21.059 --> 05:24.694
Let me repeat that,
I do not play favorites.

05:26.165 --> 05:27.598
Hey, Claire!

05:27.600 --> 05:29.833
There's my little champion.

05:29.835 --> 05:33.336
Hope we get to see
that kick today. Yeah.

05:38.711 --> 05:40.877
I'm not trying to be rude,

05:40.879 --> 05:43.012
I'm just simply
stating fact.

05:43.014 --> 05:48.117
We are the number one
girls' soccer club in the state.

05:48.119 --> 05:50.987
We have won the Diamond Cup
three years in a row,

05:50.989 --> 05:54.591
s-so simple math states
that you, you, you...

05:54.593 --> 05:58.030
Not you, girl.
...You, you, you or you,

05:59.264 --> 06:01.200
are not Crush material.

06:03.235 --> 06:06.903
Enough with the pleasantries.
Let's get started.

06:08.273 --> 06:11.675
Yellow brick road time.
Munchkins over there.

06:11.677 --> 06:15.713
Let's go! Pretend like you wanna
play something! Maybe soccer!

06:17.215 --> 06:19.886
Waiting to see
something good, ladies.

06:27.225 --> 06:29.062
You call that soccer?

06:31.396 --> 06:33.363
You need to do
better out there.

06:33.365 --> 06:35.365
All right,
line up for the next drill.

06:35.367 --> 06:36.966
Winners always line up.

06:38.838 --> 06:40.336
You're late.

06:40.338 --> 06:42.939
Yeah, I know. I know.
I'm sorry. Um.

06:42.941 --> 06:44.641
My bike chain
came off, and I...

06:44.643 --> 06:45.908
Mm.

06:45.910 --> 06:47.910
That's an excuse.
I don't like excuses.

06:47.912 --> 06:51.915
Y-Yes, yes, yes, sir.
Sorry, sir.

06:51.917 --> 06:54.151
Although, um...

06:54.153 --> 06:57.286
It's not so much an excuse
as it is what happened, and...

06:58.891 --> 07:00.423
What position are you?

07:00.425 --> 07:04.293
I'll play anywhere.
But usually striker.

07:04.295 --> 07:07.066
Ooo.

07:09.768 --> 07:11.769
This is not how
we play Crush soccer!

07:11.771 --> 07:14.204
In fact, this is not how
you play any kinda soccer.

07:14.206 --> 07:16.839
You might as well be playing
baseball or basketball.

07:16.841 --> 07:18.141
That's enough of y'all.

07:18.143 --> 07:20.146
You don't even line up
like Crush soccer.

07:21.280 --> 07:24.781
Hey, Claire!
Focus out there.

07:24.783 --> 07:27.785
Show her who
the real striker is.

07:36.728 --> 07:39.896
Ugh! Ow! Uh!

07:41.701 --> 07:44.403
Uh, Claire, it was great,
but save it for the game.

07:45.470 --> 07:46.970
Did you see that?

07:46.972 --> 07:48.838
My bad, coach.
I was just trying to

07:48.840 --> 07:52.175
play aggressive like
you always tell us. Not dirty.

07:52.177 --> 07:54.346
Good job.

08:02.454 --> 08:05.322
Sorry, slipped.

08:05.324 --> 08:06.925
Striker.

08:08.761 --> 08:10.927
It's okay. There's
always next time.

08:10.929 --> 08:12.463
- Hey.
- Number 4.

08:12.465 --> 08:14.764
- Kids didn't stand a chance.
- All right, yes!

08:14.766 --> 08:16.365
My little champion
right there.

08:16.367 --> 08:18.769
She'll get you another
Diamond Cup, coach.

08:18.771 --> 08:19.706
Let's go, sweetie.

08:21.273 --> 08:23.973
Thanks for coming out.
Keep working hard.

08:23.975 --> 08:25.942
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
wait, wait.

08:25.944 --> 08:27.810
Sorry, th-that's it?

08:27.812 --> 08:29.214
I've seen enough.

08:30.316 --> 08:32.216
You barely
watched me.

08:32.217 --> 08:34.884
Is that my fault?
My bike chain didn't break.

08:34.885 --> 08:36.220
Uh.

08:36.222 --> 08:38.087
That... That's not fair.

08:38.089 --> 08:39.490
Life isn't fair.

08:39.491 --> 08:42.960
Haven't you heard that sports
teaches life lessons?

08:42.962 --> 08:46.395
Yeah, but I think you're
applying it wrong here.

08:46.397 --> 08:48.065
I doubt it.

08:48.067 --> 08:50.366
I've been Coach of the Year
three years running.

08:50.368 --> 08:54.437
Okay, all I want is a chance
to play on your team.

08:54.439 --> 08:58.174
Just... Just a chance.

08:58.176 --> 09:00.210
I'm sorry.
I think that ship has sailed.

09:00.212 --> 09:02.178
Ships sail at 13?

09:02.180 --> 09:03.947
In club soccer, they do.

09:03.949 --> 09:06.350
If you were someone,
I would have known you by now.

09:06.352 --> 09:09.019
My girls here who play club
have been playing for me

09:09.021 --> 09:10.453
since they were
8, 9 years old.

09:10.455 --> 09:12.489
Alex Morgan didn't
play club until she...

09:12.491 --> 09:15.392
Yeah, Alex Morgan didn't play
club until she was 13.

09:15.394 --> 09:18.528
Every girl who gets cut clings
to that story like a life vest.

09:18.530 --> 09:23.567
But playing for Crush
is my dream.

09:23.569 --> 09:26.302
Sometimes dreams die.

09:26.304 --> 09:28.971
Life lesson number two.

09:54.567 --> 09:56.269
Ow.

10:20.425 --> 10:22.592
I can't thank you
enough for being here.

10:22.594 --> 10:24.595
This is just an honor, coach.

10:24.597 --> 10:26.929
Logan has worked so hard
for this moment.

10:26.931 --> 10:29.198
Uh, football is his life.

10:29.200 --> 10:32.936
I hear that you played some ball
yourself, Mr. Wills.

10:32.938 --> 10:35.938
Yeah, until I got hurt
senior year of high school.

10:35.940 --> 10:39.042
Uh, so, that was it.
Sometimes dreams die.

10:39.044 --> 10:41.311
Ahem. But so close.

10:41.313 --> 10:44.081
Anyways,
it's not about me anymore.

10:44.083 --> 10:46.249
Go back, full scholarship?

10:46.251 --> 10:48.051
Full scholarship.

10:48.053 --> 10:51.120
Wow. I mean, I just
wanna say thank you, coach.

10:51.122 --> 10:53.256
Thank you. I-I'm gonna
keep saying thank you

10:53.258 --> 10:55.359
until you get tired of me
saying thank you.

10:55.361 --> 10:57.628
I've called everywhere.
And I know the deadline

10:57.630 --> 10:59.263
to sign up for AYSO passed,

10:59.265 --> 11:01.934
but I was wondering
if there's still a spot.

11:04.402 --> 11:07.439
No. No, I... I understand.

11:08.339 --> 11:10.910
Okay. Bye.

11:36.200 --> 11:38.904
I guess ships
do sail at 13.

11:45.444 --> 11:50.080
Logan's right.
I'm talking to a poster.

12:19.611 --> 12:21.648
Why won't this come off?

12:28.219 --> 12:30.589
Come on!

12:36.627 --> 12:38.427
Hello?

12:38.429 --> 12:39.528
Reagan.

12:39.530 --> 12:41.298
Are you all right?

12:41.300 --> 12:44.000
Man, that was a bad fall.

12:44.002 --> 12:46.302
Can you even hear me?

12:46.304 --> 12:47.738
Are you okay?

12:50.208 --> 12:52.408
Reagan, are you all right?

12:53.612 --> 12:54.579
Wha...?

13:00.184 --> 13:03.086
Mom! I need to go to
the doctor right now!

13:03.088 --> 13:05.589
I hit my head really hard,
and now I'm seeing things!

13:05.591 --> 13:08.291
- You're not seeing things.
- And now I'm hearing things!

13:08.293 --> 13:10.460
It's okay.
You're just hallucinating.

13:10.462 --> 13:13.496
You're not hallucinating.
I can prove it.

13:13.498 --> 13:16.198
My name is Alex Morgan,
and my birthday is July 2nd.

13:16.200 --> 13:18.368
My parents are Mike and Pam,
and my sisters...

13:18.370 --> 13:19.702
That doesn't prove anything!

13:19.704 --> 13:21.671
This-This could all
still be in my head.

13:21.673 --> 13:25.241
I-I know everything about you.
I'm-I'm your biggest fan.

13:25.243 --> 13:26.809
Do you know
I grew up in...

13:26.811 --> 13:28.512
Diamond Bar.

13:28.514 --> 13:30.246
Or that my first
club team was...

13:30.248 --> 13:32.182
Cypress Elite.

13:32.184 --> 13:33.716
Or that my nickname
used to be

13:33.718 --> 13:35.652
Baby Horse.

13:35.654 --> 13:38.187
And your college degree
was in political economy.

13:38.189 --> 13:40.190
You have a license
to drive a motorcycle.

13:40.192 --> 13:42.525
Favorite color is pink.
Favorite food is Mexican.

13:42.527 --> 13:45.327
Your favorite song is "Man in
the Mirror" by Michael Jackson.

13:45.329 --> 13:47.798
Wow. I don't even
think my mom knows all that.

13:48.800 --> 13:50.499
Told ya. Number one fan.

13:50.501 --> 13:51.735
I'm impressed.

13:51.737 --> 13:53.637
Thank you,
hallucination.

13:53.639 --> 13:54.638
You're welcome.

13:54.640 --> 13:55.705
Wow.

13:56.775 --> 13:58.607
This feels so real.

13:58.609 --> 14:02.278
Honey, what is wrong?
What happened?

14:02.280 --> 14:05.081
I fell.
And I hit my head.

14:05.083 --> 14:06.716
- And... And, uh...
- This won't end well.

14:06.718 --> 14:08.250
What won't end well?

14:08.252 --> 14:10.220
- Huh? What?
- No, no, not y... Not you, Mom.

14:10.222 --> 14:11.587
Not me what?

14:11.589 --> 14:13.557
- I'll come back at another time.
- No! Don't go.

14:13.559 --> 14:15.258
I'm not going anywhere,
honey.

14:15.260 --> 14:16.793
Mom,
I'm not talking to you.

14:16.795 --> 14:18.662
Who are you talking to?

14:18.664 --> 14:20.297
Alex Morgan.

14:20.299 --> 14:21.730
Alex Morgan?

14:21.732 --> 14:24.100
You-You didn't just
hear her when she talked?

14:24.102 --> 14:25.869
- Who?
- Alex.

14:25.871 --> 14:29.172
You're hearing voices
from your pennant?

14:29.174 --> 14:32.408
No, not the pennant.
That's crazy.

14:32.410 --> 14:33.345
From the poster.

14:35.380 --> 14:39.448
I'm talking to the Alex Morgan
that's standing right there.

14:39.450 --> 14:42.254
- Right where?
- There.

14:49.828 --> 14:51.661
Now follow my finger.

14:52.664 --> 14:54.297
I know it
sounds crazy, Mom.

14:54.299 --> 14:56.600
But Alex Morgan
was standing in my room...

14:56.602 --> 14:59.170
Now follow
this finger. Shh.

15:03.242 --> 15:04.841
It's probably
just a temporary thing

15:04.843 --> 15:06.576
caused by hitting
her head.

15:06.578 --> 15:09.346
Some kids see stars.
Our daughter sees soccer stars.

15:09.348 --> 15:11.148
But she'll be fine.

15:11.150 --> 15:14.554
Did you know
she talks to her poster?

15:18.589 --> 15:20.590
You sure this
doesn't have something

15:20.592 --> 15:21.691
to do with
her brother?

15:22.828 --> 15:24.226
No, Dad.

15:24.228 --> 15:26.196
Shocking,
but this was one thing

15:26.198 --> 15:27.764
that was not
about Logan.

16:09.841 --> 16:12.178
Hello?

16:14.612 --> 16:16.648
Hello?

16:50.815 --> 16:52.982
Are you just gonna
stand there and watch?

16:52.984 --> 16:55.317
'Cause you gotta work
on your opposite foot.

16:55.319 --> 16:58.321
You've got a great right,
but your left kinda stinks.

16:58.323 --> 16:59.322
But...

17:00.324 --> 17:02.325
You're not real.

17:02.327 --> 17:03.893
Are you?

17:03.895 --> 17:05.662
If you believe in
a goal or a dream

17:05.664 --> 17:07.631
before it happens,
is that real?

17:07.633 --> 17:09.464
What are you doing here?

17:09.467 --> 17:12.736
You said you wanted some tips.
Remember?

17:12.738 --> 17:13.769
Are you a ghost?

17:13.771 --> 17:15.640
Do I look like a ghost?

17:17.876 --> 17:19.643
You look real to me.

17:19.645 --> 17:22.377
Then I guess I must be real.
Let's get started.

17:22.380 --> 17:23.613
Started what?

17:23.615 --> 17:25.015
Training.

17:25.017 --> 17:27.651
You're gonna train me? You?

17:27.653 --> 17:29.986
I can't have my number one
fan quit.

17:29.988 --> 17:31.354
It would look bad.

17:31.356 --> 17:33.690
I-I didn't make Crush.

17:33.692 --> 17:35.991
And the other teams'
rosters are set.

17:35.993 --> 17:38.295
The ship has sailed.

17:38.297 --> 17:40.596
Ships don't sail at 13.

17:40.598 --> 17:41.931
That's what I said!

17:41.933 --> 17:44.601
I got cut from my club team
when I was your age.

17:44.603 --> 17:46.970
I didn't quit.
Turned out okay for me.

17:57.049 --> 17:58.850
Oh! Sorry, sorry!

18:08.626 --> 18:10.593
I'm practicing
with Alex Morgan!

18:10.595 --> 18:12.729
Lock your ankle
when you pass.

18:12.731 --> 18:14.029
Like this?

18:14.031 --> 18:16.098
Good. Again.

18:16.100 --> 18:17.567
Okay.

18:19.838 --> 18:22.005
It's all right.
Don't get frustrated.

18:22.007 --> 18:24.644
Keep your head down,
and just focus on the pass.

18:26.544 --> 18:27.609
Great.

18:27.611 --> 18:29.945
Try your left foot now.

18:29.947 --> 18:31.114
Nice.

18:49.367 --> 18:50.767
That one was really good.

18:50.769 --> 18:52.067
Thanks. Ha, ha.

18:52.069 --> 18:54.503
Keep going.

18:54.505 --> 18:55.607
Perfect.

18:56.607 --> 18:57.707
Nice.

18:57.709 --> 18:59.142
Wanna train tomorrow?

18:59.144 --> 19:01.144
Say when, I'll be there.
I'll do what it takes.

19:01.146 --> 19:03.813
Good, because
that is what it takes.

19:03.815 --> 19:04.950
Okay. Ready?

19:06.885 --> 19:08.884
- That's all right.
- Okay.

19:08.886 --> 19:13.856
<i>♪ I was waiting in the moment
For the beat of love... ♪</i>

19:13.858 --> 19:15.557
Thank you.

19:15.559 --> 19:16.960
Hello.

19:16.962 --> 19:19.429
Cute new boy coming
on your right at 3 o'clock.

19:19.431 --> 19:21.967
Play it smooth. Claire's
getting ready to make her move.

19:24.703 --> 19:25.835
Hey, Reagan.

19:25.837 --> 19:28.505
I'm so sorry! Oh.

19:28.507 --> 19:30.973
Real smooth, Regs.

19:30.975 --> 19:32.842
I thought
we were training today.

19:32.844 --> 19:35.444
Oh, Ben.
Are you okay?

19:35.446 --> 19:38.515
What's your glitch?

19:38.517 --> 19:40.150
No worries. All good.

19:40.152 --> 19:43.853
I, uh...
I am so, so sorry.

19:43.855 --> 19:46.492
I-I-I saw a spider.

19:52.030 --> 19:55.030
Um, yeah, must have been
a big spider, then, huh?

19:55.032 --> 19:56.598
Y-Yeah. Mm-hm.

19:56.600 --> 19:57.767
I'm Ben.

19:57.769 --> 19:59.102
Ready?

20:00.672 --> 20:03.539
Right now?

20:03.541 --> 20:05.909
Um, I'm pretty sure
I've always been Ben.

20:05.911 --> 20:07.876
I mean, at least
since I was born.

20:07.878 --> 20:10.579
Wait, what?
No, no, no! I'm sorry, no.

20:10.581 --> 20:12.915
No, um, I'm... I'm Reagan.

20:12.917 --> 20:16.586
Whatever it takes. Remember?
This is what it takes.

20:16.588 --> 20:19.724
You said we were
training today. Your words.

20:21.792 --> 20:23.092
If you don't want my help...

20:23.094 --> 20:24.897
Wait, wait,
wait, wait!

20:26.665 --> 20:27.933
Uh.

20:29.634 --> 20:30.903
I have to go.

20:33.104 --> 20:34.671
Hi. I'm Grace.

20:34.673 --> 20:36.205
Please.

20:36.207 --> 20:38.474
C'mon, Ben.
Come sit with us.

20:38.476 --> 20:41.743
Perfect. Keep going.
Keep going.

20:41.745 --> 20:44.614
Now let's turn it around,
do inside, outside the foot.

20:44.616 --> 20:45.748
Okay.

20:45.750 --> 20:47.784
<i>Good turn. Good.</i>

20:47.786 --> 20:50.086
- All right, let's do sole rolls.
- Okay.

20:50.088 --> 20:51.921
That was harsh.

20:51.923 --> 20:53.189
At the burger place.

20:53.191 --> 20:55.557
When I was your age,
I practiced every day.

20:55.559 --> 20:57.961
Yeah, but you're
Alex Morgan.

20:57.963 --> 21:00.797
Not back then. I was just
a kid with a dream.

21:00.799 --> 21:03.199
Like you right now.
Look around.

21:03.201 --> 21:06.001
How many other people do you
see out here practicing?

21:06.003 --> 21:08.037
- Nobody.
- Exactly.

21:08.039 --> 21:10.507
You know who else used
to do hours of practice?

21:10.509 --> 21:13.209
Not only because she had to,
but because she had a dream?

21:13.211 --> 21:14.777
Mia Hamm.

21:14.779 --> 21:17.180
You know who else used
to do practice rain or shine

21:17.182 --> 21:20.549
on any field or driveway
she could find? Abby Wambach.

21:21.720 --> 21:23.619
You know who never
did extra practice,

21:23.621 --> 21:25.087
who only did what
she had to do,

21:25.089 --> 21:27.557
and just hung out
on the weekends?

21:27.559 --> 21:29.692
- Who?
- Natalie Gunderson.

21:29.694 --> 21:31.227
Who's Natalie Gunderson?

21:31.229 --> 21:33.663
Exactly.
All right, keep going.

21:33.665 --> 21:35.832
Sole rolls.

21:35.834 --> 21:38.170
You're getting
a lot better. Good.

21:41.239 --> 21:43.008
No.

22:01.225 --> 22:03.926
At 6 a.m.? Seriously?

22:03.928 --> 22:05.230
Rise and shine!

22:10.801 --> 22:13.001
Keep going. You can do it.
Come on.

22:13.003 --> 22:15.070
You're out here working
toward your dreams

22:15.072 --> 22:18.141
while Natalie Gunderson
is sleeping. And done.

22:21.279 --> 22:24.550
I am so jealous of
Natalie Gunderson

22:26.350 --> 22:27.951
Good. Turn around.

22:27.953 --> 22:29.254
- Jeez.
- Okay.

22:30.855 --> 22:32.288
Let's see some juggling.

22:32.290 --> 22:34.891
Okay. One, two,

22:34.893 --> 22:37.226
three, four, five, six.

22:37.228 --> 22:38.760
I think I got this.

22:38.762 --> 22:40.262
Hey!

22:40.264 --> 22:42.568
God, that's my
state championship trophy.

22:44.802 --> 22:47.604
Sorry! But you-you
got another, right?

22:47.606 --> 22:49.675
Not the point!

22:52.376 --> 22:53.913
Okay, nice.

22:55.713 --> 22:56.846
<i>Good one.</i>

22:56.848 --> 22:58.280
C'mon.
I wanna see a left.

22:58.282 --> 23:00.650
I will. Later.

23:00.652 --> 23:02.384
If you don't
practice it here,

23:02.386 --> 23:04.322
later will never
come when it counts.

23:17.668 --> 23:19.402
What kind of spider
was it this time?

23:19.404 --> 23:22.204
My coach is always telling me
to look up when I dribble.

23:22.206 --> 23:24.740
I need better touches
with my left.

23:24.742 --> 23:27.143
You know, I think
that was a yellow card.

23:27.145 --> 23:28.377
On you or me?

23:28.379 --> 23:29.778
Definitely you.

23:29.780 --> 23:31.713
I've seen you around here
a lot lately.

23:31.715 --> 23:33.715
I come up here to
practice sometimes too.

23:33.717 --> 23:36.251
We just moved in.
Right over there.

23:36.253 --> 23:37.920
Around the corner,
on Longridge.

23:37.922 --> 23:39.655
Welcome.

23:40.992 --> 23:43.259
You're really
working hard.

23:43.261 --> 23:44.661
I'm trying.

23:44.663 --> 23:45.994
How do you stay
so motivated?

23:47.898 --> 23:51.867
Don't do it. Remember the whole
flashlight-in-the-eyes thing.

23:53.137 --> 23:54.369
I dunno.

23:54.371 --> 23:56.172
Whatever it is,
it's working.

23:56.174 --> 23:57.108
Who do you play for?

23:59.444 --> 24:01.044
Nobody.

24:01.046 --> 24:02.679
What? Get outta here.

24:02.681 --> 24:04.780
- You're good.
- No, I...

24:04.782 --> 24:06.348
You think so?

24:06.350 --> 24:08.183
Yeah.

24:08.185 --> 24:10.053
Well, who do you play for?

24:10.055 --> 24:11.354
United Real.

24:11.356 --> 24:13.056
Oh, wow. They're good.

24:13.058 --> 24:14.757
I mean,
they can't be that good.

24:14.759 --> 24:16.159
They let me on the team.

24:16.161 --> 24:19.194
Need any more players?

24:19.196 --> 24:22.097
Um, well,
my-my friend's cousin,

24:22.099 --> 24:23.365
she plays
for a small club.

24:23.367 --> 24:24.933
The Breakaways?

24:24.935 --> 24:27.135
She was talking about
how they need one more,

24:27.137 --> 24:28.904
'cause somebody
moved out of town.

24:28.906 --> 24:30.205
If you're interested.

24:30.207 --> 24:32.442
The Breakaways?

24:32.444 --> 24:34.009
I think they're new-ish.

24:34.011 --> 24:35.912
I mean, she said
they're not a great team.

24:35.914 --> 24:37.814
But it's a chance
to play this season.

24:37.816 --> 24:41.084
How not great
could they be?

24:47.992 --> 24:50.292
You here to try out?

24:50.294 --> 24:53.429
Uh, yeah... Yeah.

24:53.431 --> 24:55.167
Cool.

25:04.108 --> 25:06.211
What are you waiting for?

25:08.980 --> 25:10.348
Okay.

25:16.488 --> 25:18.323
Who cut you?

25:19.389 --> 25:20.522
Excuse me?

25:20.524 --> 25:22.157
What team
didn't you make?

25:22.159 --> 25:23.859
That's why you're
here, right?

25:23.861 --> 25:27.130
Somebody cut you or you
didn't make another team?

25:27.132 --> 25:28.396
It's okay.

25:28.398 --> 25:30.999
Nobody joins
this team first.

25:31.001 --> 25:32.468
I got cut by
the Jags.

25:32.470 --> 25:34.369
Oh.

25:34.371 --> 25:36.772
- Crush.
- Mm.

25:36.774 --> 25:39.776
You know, this team,
the Breakaways,

25:39.778 --> 25:42.278
it got its name because
it was formed when some girls

25:42.280 --> 25:45.080
'broke away' from Crush,
right?

25:45.082 --> 25:49.885
And by broke away,
I mean got cut.

25:49.887 --> 25:52.954
Jolly
good work, girls. That's it.

25:52.956 --> 25:55.057
Back and forth,
pass the ball, tickety-boo.

25:55.059 --> 25:58.560
Keep it going along.
Great. Right.

25:58.562 --> 26:01.329
Oh, I'd watch out
for the glass and the...

26:01.331 --> 26:05.433
Maybe the live electrical wires.
Don't step on those.

26:05.435 --> 26:08.171
For cryin' out loud, Bug!

26:08.173 --> 26:09.471
Your moves gotta be faster.

26:09.473 --> 26:11.007
You keep stopping
and looking

26:11.009 --> 26:12.474
like you're crossing
the street.

26:12.476 --> 26:14.410
Haven't you ever
heard the saying:

26:14.412 --> 26:16.244
"Slow and steady
wins the race?"

26:16.246 --> 26:18.047
The race,
not the soccer game.

26:18.049 --> 26:20.853
Soccer is about fast.
Like this.

26:23.221 --> 26:24.519
Whoa!

26:25.924 --> 26:28.193
Don't even.

26:29.560 --> 26:31.993
She's...? She's 13?

26:31.995 --> 26:34.262
Bug? No. Nine.

26:34.264 --> 26:35.565
Need the players.

26:35.567 --> 26:37.133
Codswallop!

26:37.135 --> 26:39.335
I almost caught
a Level 6 Zernorf.

26:39.337 --> 26:41.938
Coach.

26:41.940 --> 26:43.976
New girl trying out.

26:45.276 --> 26:46.608
Reagan.

26:46.610 --> 26:49.244
Cheers, Reagan.
Uh, my name's Coach Nigel.

26:49.246 --> 26:52.414
First thing: has Gia
given you the panic word?

26:52.416 --> 26:54.083
Oh, the panic word
is "apricot."

26:54.085 --> 26:55.585
If you hear
that during practice,

26:55.587 --> 26:57.086
stop whatever
you're doing,

26:57.088 --> 26:59.555
and hide till coach
sounds the all clear.

26:59.557 --> 27:01.022
Uh...

27:01.024 --> 27:02.959
It means somebody saw
a city truck.

27:02.961 --> 27:07.128
Don't wanna get busted for
trespassing and lose our field.

27:10.167 --> 27:13.635
Thanks for letting me
try out, coach.

27:13.637 --> 27:15.904
Have you played
the beautiful game before?

27:15.906 --> 27:17.506
- Yeah.
- Right on.

27:17.508 --> 27:19.342
Welcome to the Breakaways,
Reagan.

27:19.344 --> 27:22.347
Don't consider this a tryout.
Consider it your first practice.

27:24.081 --> 27:25.647
Uh...

27:25.649 --> 27:27.549
Hey, look, our first game
is in two weeks.

27:27.551 --> 27:29.285
How many girls
do you see here?

27:29.287 --> 27:32.555
Um... Ten?

27:32.557 --> 27:35.191
But soccer goes up
to 11, right?

27:35.193 --> 27:36.558
So welcome aboard!

27:36.560 --> 27:38.527
Get your boots on.
Meet us on the pitch.

27:38.529 --> 27:40.663
Huh? Let's go!

27:40.665 --> 27:42.464
Right-o, everybody!
Let's line up!

27:42.466 --> 27:44.967
Whew.
You just made the cut.

27:44.969 --> 27:47.236
That was
a real squeaker.

27:47.238 --> 27:49.438
...the point of the
whole game, isn't it?

27:49.440 --> 27:51.507
Uh, why...? Why...?

27:51.509 --> 27:53.409
Do we practice here?

27:53.411 --> 27:55.111
Yeah.

27:55.113 --> 27:57.179
Some real estate
developer bought the land

27:57.181 --> 27:58.413
where our old field was

27:58.415 --> 28:00.650
to build new apartments
or something.

28:00.652 --> 28:02.183
Ouch.

28:02.185 --> 28:04.119
It's not so bad here,
though.

28:04.121 --> 28:07.124
It's pretty private.

28:09.493 --> 28:12.494
You gotta dive, Lexi!

28:12.496 --> 28:14.430
My allergies are acting up!

28:15.666 --> 28:18.034
She's allergic.

28:18.036 --> 28:19.301
To what?

28:19.303 --> 28:21.202
Grass.

28:21.204 --> 28:23.338
Not quite Crush, huh?

28:23.340 --> 28:25.473
Come on, Bug. You're next.
Have at it.

28:25.475 --> 28:28.310
Blimey! Don't bimble,
Bug. Come on, fast!

28:28.312 --> 28:29.679
That's what I told her,

28:29.681 --> 28:32.280
but Lexi started
quoting Shakespeare.

28:32.282 --> 28:34.383
Shakespeare? Slow and steady
is the moral

28:34.385 --> 28:36.018
of one of Aesop's fables.

28:36.020 --> 28:38.086
Let's not bicker about
who quoted who.

28:38.088 --> 28:40.388
This is supposed
to be a happy practice.

28:40.390 --> 28:42.090
Coach is a good guy.

28:42.092 --> 28:43.960
He played over
in England.

28:43.962 --> 28:46.228
Really? For who?

28:46.230 --> 28:50.066
South... Tetherton
or something. I dunno.

28:50.068 --> 28:53.102
But he's British
so he knows soccer, right?

28:53.104 --> 28:54.135
No, no, no.

28:54.137 --> 28:55.471
Penny, Penny, Penny.

28:55.473 --> 28:57.573
You... You gotta use
the inside of your foot

28:57.575 --> 28:59.611
if you're gonna dribble.
Like this, right?

29:01.980 --> 29:05.117
Like that. Like this.
All right?

29:08.019 --> 29:10.322
- Uh...
- He's British.

29:13.323 --> 29:15.660
Bring it in.
Come on, gather round.

29:17.294 --> 29:18.493
Come on.

29:18.495 --> 29:20.162
All right.

29:20.164 --> 29:22.198
Well let's give
a big Breakaway welcome

29:22.200 --> 29:23.732
to the newest member
of our team...

29:23.734 --> 29:25.201
Apricot! Apricot!

29:33.511 --> 29:36.045
Come on!

29:37.749 --> 29:39.647
So I was watching <i>The Bachelor.</i>

29:39.649 --> 29:41.549
- They're on this island.
- Uh-huh.

29:41.551 --> 29:44.053
He's got all these women.
He's got a rose,

29:44.055 --> 29:46.221
but he doesn't have enough
for all the women.

29:46.223 --> 29:47.757
- You with me on this?
- Yeah.

29:47.759 --> 29:50.058
MAN 1 Beautiful island,
women, couple roses.

29:50.060 --> 29:52.361
- Like <i>Survivor.</i>
- Yeah, but you don't

29:52.363 --> 29:54.696
watch it, do you?
Yeah, I didn't watch it either.

29:54.698 --> 29:56.565
Anyway, they're
on the island, right?

29:56.567 --> 29:58.267
He's got the roses,
and he uses...

29:58.269 --> 30:00.036
- Welcome to the team.
- Yeah, welcome.

30:00.038 --> 30:01.136
Thanks.

30:01.138 --> 30:02.637
Glad to have you,
Rachel.

30:02.639 --> 30:04.039
Reagan.

30:07.177 --> 30:10.046
<i>♪ You in my arms
My hands in your hair ♪</i>

30:10.048 --> 30:12.114
<i>♪ Come on, sugar, nothing... ♪</i>

30:15.052 --> 30:17.086
The goalie is allergic.

30:17.088 --> 30:18.520
To grass.

30:18.522 --> 30:22.324
A soccer goalie.
Allergic. To grass!

30:22.326 --> 30:24.492
Not ideal.

30:24.494 --> 30:29.731
We're practicing on
a city storage area place.

30:29.733 --> 30:31.666
At least it's
super-private.

30:33.370 --> 30:35.471
Hey, it's a chance to play
on a team this season.

30:35.473 --> 30:36.739
Isn't that what
you wanted?

30:36.741 --> 30:39.075
I wanted to play
for Crush.

30:39.077 --> 30:41.509
If I'd made them,
maybe...

30:41.511 --> 30:44.215
Maybe I could be
a champion too.

30:45.282 --> 30:47.282
Like Logan.

30:47.284 --> 30:50.286
You wouldn't understand.

30:57.261 --> 30:59.461
I made that team.
Thanks for the tip.

30:59.463 --> 31:01.763
- You're welcome.
- Keep your head up.

31:01.765 --> 31:03.399
Use your left foot.

31:07.704 --> 31:09.204
Uh, hello.

31:09.206 --> 31:10.839
Are you not
telling me something?

31:18.148 --> 31:19.350
Clear!

31:21.586 --> 31:23.652
My bad. Sorry, guys.

31:23.654 --> 31:27.756
Must-Must have been
a UPS truck. Okay.

31:29.726 --> 31:34.896
Nice hiding. Uh, good hustle.
Let's go, back at it.

31:34.898 --> 31:37.766
Ho, ho, tally ho
for that effort.

31:37.768 --> 31:40.368
All right, Bug.

31:40.370 --> 31:42.704
All right, okay.
Little off the mark.

31:42.706 --> 31:44.472
Let's see it, Gia.

31:47.244 --> 31:48.777
That was a bloody
nice try, Gia.

31:48.779 --> 31:50.311
A bit wonky,
though, right?

31:50.313 --> 31:52.714
Everybody, if you wanna
hit the ball hard,

31:52.716 --> 31:55.351
you gotta kick with
the tip of your toe.

31:55.353 --> 31:57.486
And keep your head
up, looking at the goal,

31:57.488 --> 31:59.288
so you know what
you're shooting at.

31:59.290 --> 32:00.556
Right? Make sense?

32:00.558 --> 32:02.394
Let's see it, Penny.

32:04.662 --> 32:06.595
Oh, that was
a real corker, Penny!

32:06.597 --> 32:08.329
That's the way you do it!

32:08.331 --> 32:11.666
And remember,
tip of the old toe.

32:11.668 --> 32:14.470
Toe down. Strike through
the ball with your laces,

32:14.472 --> 32:17.539
head down,
eyes following the ball.

32:17.541 --> 32:20.308
All right, you're next,
Reagan. Let's see it.

32:20.310 --> 32:22.243
Hey, coach,

32:22.245 --> 32:24.646
mind if I try it
a different way?

32:24.648 --> 32:26.347
A different...?

32:26.349 --> 32:28.517
There might be different
ways to kick a ball,

32:28.519 --> 32:31.519
but when I was studying at the
Royal Academy of Soccer, um...

32:31.521 --> 32:33.388
Wow.

32:33.390 --> 32:36.759
Right. Uh, let's give
Reagan's way

32:36.761 --> 32:38.693
the ole Queen's try,
shall we?

32:38.695 --> 32:40.499
Mm-hm.

32:55.745 --> 32:59.381
Hi, sweetie.
What's wrong with your bike?

32:59.383 --> 33:01.349
Chain keeps popping.

33:01.351 --> 33:03.420
Want me
to take a look at it?

33:05.522 --> 33:07.823
Actually...

33:07.825 --> 33:11.326
I want you to come to my
first game on Saturday.

33:11.328 --> 33:12.760
This Saturday?

33:12.762 --> 33:13.962
- Yes.
- What time?

33:13.964 --> 33:15.897
- Eleven a.m.
- Oh, sweetheart.

33:15.899 --> 33:18.267
Logan and I have a meeting
with a coach then.

33:18.269 --> 33:20.769
You could miss one meeting
with one coach.

33:20.771 --> 33:22.805
You've met, with, like,
50 of them.

33:22.807 --> 33:26.008
Honey, you know how important
that scholarship is.

33:26.010 --> 33:28.978
You know, to Logan.
Hey, to our family.

33:28.980 --> 33:33.548
Well this game
is important to me.

33:33.550 --> 33:36.251
And Mom has to work
on Saturday.

33:36.253 --> 33:38.487
Please, Dad.

33:38.489 --> 33:40.492
It's against Crush.

33:43.461 --> 33:45.928
Okay, I'll see
if I can change it.

33:45.930 --> 33:48.263
Really?

33:48.265 --> 33:49.698
Promise?

33:49.700 --> 33:51.299
Yes, I promise.

33:51.301 --> 33:52.934
Thanks, Dad.

33:52.936 --> 33:55.270
You're welcome, now.

33:55.272 --> 33:57.705
Let's fix this again.

33:59.342 --> 34:00.976
- Okay.
- Okay.

34:00.978 --> 34:04.012
No tape anywhere near...
Let's... Okay, first rule,

34:04.014 --> 34:06.414
chains and tape
don't go together.

34:06.416 --> 34:08.049
Champions get
their knees up.

34:08.051 --> 34:11.386
Here we go.
One more time for a champion.

34:11.388 --> 34:13.388
Two times makes you
a champion.

34:13.389 --> 34:16.792
One time makes you
a runner up.

34:16.793 --> 34:18.860
We're champions,
Crush soccer here.

34:18.862 --> 34:21.728
Sides are next. Right sides.

34:21.731 --> 34:24.565
All right, let's not look
too hunky-dory.

34:26.303 --> 34:29.304
Penny, I think you need
to figure out

34:29.306 --> 34:32.408
how your legs work.
Let's stay on them.

34:32.409 --> 34:33.940
Let's stay upright.

34:33.943 --> 34:35.710
You generally
wanna stay upright.

34:35.713 --> 34:37.379
That's, I think, rule one.

34:37.380 --> 34:39.348
Gonna do four of these.

34:39.350 --> 34:40.947
That's what champions do.

34:40.949 --> 34:43.551
Run four times.

34:43.553 --> 34:46.353
Any runner-ups here?

34:46.356 --> 34:48.456
I don't know any runner-ups.

34:48.458 --> 34:50.324
All I know is champions.

34:50.327 --> 34:53.696
All right, this is a right
frog and toad, isn't it?

34:53.697 --> 34:56.635
Yeah, a regular
fox and hound.

34:58.368 --> 35:01.870
Well let's not
cat and fiddle it, okay?

35:01.872 --> 35:04.772
Check this out.
I can record all Lilly's games.

35:04.774 --> 35:06.941
That's cute.

35:06.943 --> 35:09.345
Camera one, you a go?

35:11.015 --> 35:12.517
Camera two?

35:16.519 --> 35:17.919
Okay. Okay. Okay.

35:17.921 --> 35:19.488
I'll send you a copy.

35:19.490 --> 35:20.589
Thanks.

35:20.591 --> 35:21.857
- Who are we?
- Crush!

35:21.859 --> 35:22.957
- Who?
- Crush!

35:22.959 --> 35:24.426
- What do we do?
- Crush!

35:24.428 --> 35:26.028
- What do we do?
- Crush!

35:26.030 --> 35:28.629
- In on three! One! Two! Three!
- Crush! Kick! Destroy!

35:28.631 --> 35:31.834
We're gonna play knees up, don't
go to spare if we fall behind.

35:31.836 --> 35:33.901
If I know my onions
about this game,

35:33.903 --> 35:36.404
today won't turn out
to be a damp squib.

35:36.406 --> 35:40.475
Go get 'em! That's good!
We got it! Nice!

35:40.477 --> 35:43.745
I thought they spoke English
in England.

35:43.747 --> 35:46.080
Reagan, Reagan.
Hey, uh, the...

35:46.082 --> 35:48.850
The coach didn't get my message,
and he's at the house.

35:48.852 --> 35:51.453
Your Mom's at work,
so I gotta go. I'm sorry.

35:51.455 --> 35:54.589
But, no, but... But, Dad, you...
You promised...

35:54.591 --> 35:55.991
Honey, I'm...
I'm sorry. Okay?

35:55.993 --> 35:58.093
I'm gonna try to come back,
but I gotta go.

35:58.095 --> 36:00.696
He's there by himself,
I gotta go with Logan, okay?

36:00.698 --> 36:03.031
I'm sorry. I'll be back, though.
Okay? Have fun.

36:03.033 --> 36:05.133
I'm coming right now, son.
Have fun!

36:05.135 --> 36:07.703
Reagan, let's go.
It's kick-off.

36:07.705 --> 36:09.404
Hey, Claire.

36:09.406 --> 36:10.874
Remember.

36:12.776 --> 36:15.778
Hey, Jen, my dad usually
gives me 25 dollars a goal.

36:15.780 --> 36:18.046
But when he found out
who we were playing today,

36:18.048 --> 36:19.848
he dropped it to 10.

36:19.850 --> 36:22.651
Pretty sure that's not good from
a developmental standpoint.

36:22.653 --> 36:26.687
- you're passing up on assists...
- Don't bother.

36:26.689 --> 36:28.857
Just let our feet
do the talking.

36:28.859 --> 36:30.691
Oh, I've seen your feet.

36:30.693 --> 36:32.961
Have you listened
to what they're saying?

36:32.963 --> 36:35.196
You can hear my foot
better when I kick your...

36:36.434 --> 36:37.598
Game time, ladies!

36:37.600 --> 36:39.000
All right, let's go!

36:39.002 --> 36:41.470
Move it, move it!

36:45.743 --> 36:47.875
Hit it up! Steal, steal!

36:47.877 --> 36:49.578
Good job. Ah.

36:49.580 --> 36:52.580
Let's go, Claire.
Come on, Claire.

36:54.785 --> 36:55.950
Bad.

36:55.952 --> 36:57.185
Worse.

36:57.187 --> 36:58.620
Deplorable.

36:58.622 --> 36:59.821
Nope.

37:02.459 --> 37:03.859
Okay, girls. Bring it in.

37:03.861 --> 37:05.593
Don't worry.
It's all right.

37:05.595 --> 37:07.930
- Winners bring it in.
- We could've lost

37:07.932 --> 37:09.897
- a lot worse than that.
- That's right.

37:09.899 --> 37:12.935
Claire!
That's my girl.

37:12.937 --> 37:14.035
Hey.

37:14.037 --> 37:15.604
- You ready?
- Yeah.

37:15.606 --> 37:17.805
Twenty, 40, 60.

37:17.807 --> 37:20.475
Let's go shopping. Come on.

37:20.477 --> 37:22.544
- Wanna get that pony?
- Yeah!

37:22.546 --> 37:24.613
Let's get that
pony for your birthday.

37:24.615 --> 37:25.781
You earned it.

38:35.653 --> 38:37.852
So sorry, Regs.

38:37.854 --> 38:39.888
How did it go?

38:39.890 --> 38:42.694
Things ran long. You know.

38:48.231 --> 38:50.167
I'm really sorry. I...

38:52.169 --> 38:54.939
The coach just got talking
and then...

38:57.774 --> 38:59.640
How did you play?
Did you girls win?

38:59.642 --> 39:01.678
Did you do good?

39:04.048 --> 39:06.984
I'm really sorry, baby.
I really am.

39:24.133 --> 39:26.935
Hey. Just so you know,

39:26.937 --> 39:30.037
today wasn't my fault.
Or Dad's.

39:30.039 --> 39:33.274
It was just
this huge mix-up.

39:33.276 --> 39:35.780
Just one of those things,
you know?

39:52.196 --> 39:54.732
Are you really
doing all this stuff?

40:04.274 --> 40:05.841
What happened?

40:05.843 --> 40:08.410
They put up a new lock
on the entire field.

40:08.412 --> 40:11.812
I told you they saw you
sneaking back in after practice.

40:11.814 --> 40:13.180
I forgot my ball!

40:14.685 --> 40:16.350
Well, maybe if someone
had yelled apricot!

40:16.352 --> 40:18.252
It's not my job.
You could've said it!

40:18.254 --> 40:21.122
- Yeah, yeah. Don't blame her.
- Well it's somebody's fault,

40:21.124 --> 40:22.991
and it surely was not mine,
because...

40:26.062 --> 40:29.163
Oh,
stop, stop, stop! Please stop!

40:29.165 --> 40:32.033
Just stop already! Oh! The
constant bickering and arguing

40:32.035 --> 40:35.236
and fighting is too much!
I can't take it anymore! Okay?

40:35.238 --> 40:36.640
Ugh.

40:38.742 --> 40:40.243
What happened
to your accent?

40:43.379 --> 40:44.779
Uh...

40:46.249 --> 40:48.018
Blimey, heh.

40:49.185 --> 40:52.354
I mean crikey, uh...

40:52.356 --> 40:55.156
Barmy, I guess I've been...

40:55.158 --> 40:57.258
living here across
the pond a bit too long,

40:57.260 --> 40:59.727
my Queen's English has gotten
a wee bit cheeky.

40:59.729 --> 41:00.861
Right? Uh...

41:00.863 --> 41:02.263
I can't.

41:02.265 --> 41:04.066
You can't what?

41:04.068 --> 41:07.102
Uh, my name's not Nigel.
It's, um...

41:07.104 --> 41:08.904
It's Nick.

41:08.906 --> 41:11.939
And I didn't grow up
in Birmingham, England.

41:11.941 --> 41:13.975
I'm from Pomona.

41:13.977 --> 41:15.209
What?

41:15.211 --> 41:17.145
I'm sorry. I am.
I'm sorry. I just...

41:17.147 --> 41:20.048
I needed a job
after the sporting goods store

41:20.050 --> 41:21.950
I was working at closed,
and...

41:21.952 --> 41:25.319
soccer parents are the most
gullible people I ever met.

41:25.321 --> 41:27.988
They think anybody
who's British knows soccer

41:27.990 --> 41:30.661
and can help their kid
be the next superstar, so...

41:32.162 --> 41:35.330
I watched
the Austin Powers movies,

41:35.332 --> 41:38.767
put up an online ad saying
I played in England, and, uh...

41:38.769 --> 41:40.334
Well the next thing
you know,

41:40.336 --> 41:44.805
parents were hiring me to coach
their kids. And this team.

41:44.807 --> 41:48.776
So where did you play
in college?

41:48.778 --> 41:49.847
Mm?

41:52.482 --> 41:54.348
High school?

41:54.350 --> 41:57.017
I was on the bowling team.

41:58.187 --> 42:00.955
Oh! Ah!

42:00.957 --> 42:02.089
So now
you're accurate.

42:02.091 --> 42:04.959
I deserved that.

42:04.961 --> 42:07.062
Aah!

42:08.464 --> 42:10.198
That's a foul.
That's a red card.

42:12.135 --> 42:15.069
Without a coach, we can't
even finish out our season.

42:15.071 --> 42:16.270
Oh, Regs.

42:16.272 --> 42:19.374
Heard the news.
Bummer.

42:19.376 --> 42:21.843
Hi, Ben!

42:21.845 --> 42:23.544
Hi, Ben!

42:23.546 --> 42:25.180
If I'm ever that annoying,

42:25.182 --> 42:27.281
I give you permission
to smack me.

42:27.283 --> 42:28.917
I wish I could help.

42:28.919 --> 42:30.951
Wish you could coach soccer.

42:30.953 --> 42:35.857
Okay, everybody, good news.
Our season can continue

42:35.859 --> 42:37.558
How? We don't have a coach.

42:37.560 --> 42:40.395
We do now, my dad.
He volunteered.

42:40.397 --> 42:41.562
Isn't that awesome?

42:41.564 --> 42:42.897
Has he ever coached?

42:42.899 --> 42:45.366
He coached
my first rec team.

42:45.368 --> 42:47.836
Then Logan got great
at football.

42:48.939 --> 42:50.272
Where is he?

42:50.274 --> 42:52.307
Uh, he's sick.

42:52.309 --> 42:54.176
That's why we're
practicing here.

42:54.178 --> 42:55.910
Across the street
from my house.

42:55.912 --> 42:59.080
So he can watch us.
From the window. Ha.

42:59.082 --> 43:01.116
Oh, hi, Daddy! Ha.

43:01.118 --> 43:02.850
Feel better!

43:02.852 --> 43:05.120
So you can coach us soon!

43:05.122 --> 43:07.122
See? All good.

43:07.124 --> 43:10.457
What...?
What's he doing now?

43:10.459 --> 43:12.294
Uh, well, he's, uh...

43:14.597 --> 43:17.832
He's just excited,

43:17.834 --> 43:21.870
and, uh, he wants
to encourage us to, um...

43:21.872 --> 43:23.508
Uh, raise the roof?

43:26.475 --> 43:28.310
Don't overdo it up there,
Dad.

43:28.312 --> 43:31.245
You wanna save your energy,
so you can get better.

43:33.182 --> 43:35.950
And now...
Now, until he's better,

43:35.952 --> 43:38.953
I saw some more drills on that
Alex Morgan training video,

43:38.955 --> 43:42.122
so let's go train
on our awesome new field.

43:42.124 --> 43:45.093
This field is so small.

43:45.095 --> 43:47.028
This field is a dump.

43:47.030 --> 43:48.930
I... I can't find
my ball again.

43:48.932 --> 43:50.966
See you next practice.

43:50.968 --> 43:53.200
Hopefully my dad
will feel better then.

43:53.202 --> 43:56.071
He's still not quite
100 percent yet.

43:58.008 --> 44:01.475
Hopefully he's turned a corner.
We're pulling for ya, Dad!

44:04.013 --> 44:05.946
I just need somebody there.

44:05.948 --> 44:07.915
You know, and my mom
can't coach

44:07.917 --> 44:10.118
'cause she works a lot
on Saturdays.

44:10.120 --> 44:12.419
You know, I was thinking
of asking our neighbor,

44:12.421 --> 44:16.357
Mr. Dittman, but he's 84 and I
think people would catch on.

44:16.359 --> 44:17.993
- Yeah, that's ridiculous.
- Mm-hm.

44:17.995 --> 44:19.326
Yeah, he uses a scooter.

44:19.328 --> 44:21.328
Why don't you just
ask your dad to coach?

44:21.330 --> 44:24.098
My dad? He won't do it.

44:24.100 --> 44:26.000
He doesn't have time.

44:26.002 --> 44:28.403
You know? I mean...

44:28.405 --> 44:31.673
And I get it.
This is Logan's moment.

44:33.109 --> 44:35.075
Logan works hard
for his dream, though.

44:35.077 --> 44:36.477
You know that, right?

44:38.515 --> 44:40.214
You're right.

44:40.216 --> 44:43.618
Look, I get he comes first.

44:43.620 --> 44:46.553
But sometimes I wish my dad

44:46.555 --> 44:49.223
would pay a little more
attention to me. You know?

44:49.225 --> 44:50.991
What do you think, Alex?

44:50.993 --> 44:52.928
She talking to
the poster again?

44:52.930 --> 44:54.995
Think?

44:54.997 --> 44:56.564
About what today?

44:56.566 --> 44:58.165
You.

44:58.167 --> 44:59.700
And sometimes
I feel like...

44:59.702 --> 45:01.468
- Me?
- ...I'm not even there.

45:01.470 --> 45:03.437
And I'll just
talk to him,

45:03.439 --> 45:06.376
but he ignores me sometimes.
I don't know why...

45:07.644 --> 45:08.676
Grace?

45:11.180 --> 45:14.482
That's a side effect.
From his medication.

45:14.484 --> 45:16.951
He sounded like a girl.

45:16.953 --> 45:18.653
Yeah, well, the medicine,

45:18.655 --> 45:20.988
it makes his voice
really high-pitched.

45:20.990 --> 45:23.158
Hopefully next week he'll,
you know...

45:23.160 --> 45:24.625
What...?
What are you guys doing?

45:24.627 --> 45:26.962
Leaving.
How is this any better

45:26.964 --> 45:29.029
than what we had with our
'British' coach?

45:29.031 --> 45:30.131
At least he showed up.

45:30.133 --> 45:31.433
Hey, we still have a team.

45:31.435 --> 45:33.167
No, we don't.
We just get together

45:33.169 --> 45:35.270
- in a different field.
- Don't say that.

45:35.272 --> 45:37.004
Whoa, whoa.
Wait, wait, wait.

45:37.006 --> 45:39.607
Sorry I'm late. Sorry!
Sorry I'm late!

45:39.609 --> 45:42.377
So sorry.

45:42.379 --> 45:47.749
Hi, I'm Joe, Reagan's dad.

45:47.751 --> 45:50.352
Nice to... Yes.

45:50.354 --> 45:53.587
You must be, uh...
on the team.

45:53.589 --> 45:55.189
Yeah.

45:55.191 --> 46:00.462
Uh, so I... Sorry. I'm Joe.
Coach Joe.

46:00.464 --> 46:03.365
I'm real sorry. I know we
got off to a rough start, but...

46:03.367 --> 46:06.200
I promise you
I'll be here for you now.

46:06.202 --> 46:07.669
I thought you were
still sick?

46:07.671 --> 46:09.203
We just heard you scream.

46:09.205 --> 46:12.674
Yeah, that.
That was a scream of joy

46:12.676 --> 46:15.410
because the doctor
just called me.

46:15.412 --> 46:18.279
He said that all the test
results are clear.

46:18.281 --> 46:19.714
Yeah. I-I'm all better.

46:19.716 --> 46:21.783
It's a miracle.

46:21.785 --> 46:23.551
What did you even have?

46:23.553 --> 46:28.122
I had a... A problem
with my vision.

46:28.124 --> 46:31.258
I couldn't see things that were
right in front of me.

46:31.260 --> 46:33.560
Really important stuff.

46:33.562 --> 46:36.096
You know, we can talk about
all that stuff later.

46:36.098 --> 46:38.366
We gotta get down to business.
Come on, let's...

46:38.368 --> 46:40.435
Let's get our gear on.
Hurry up, come on.

46:40.437 --> 46:43.203
Let's get warming up.
Get, uh... Get those, um...

46:43.205 --> 46:45.040
The balls out of the...

46:45.042 --> 46:47.709
The packs and put them
on the ground and...

46:47.711 --> 46:49.743
There you go.

46:49.745 --> 46:53.680
Uh, how...?
How did you even know I...?

46:53.682 --> 46:59.754
Your Mom. And Gracie, she...
She filled me in too.

47:02.091 --> 47:04.191
I am so sorry, Reagan.
I...

47:04.193 --> 47:08.629
I got so focused on that
scholarship, it just...

47:08.631 --> 47:11.234
I'm really sorry,
sweetheart.

47:15.472 --> 47:19.573
The only thing is I don't know
anything about soccer.

47:19.575 --> 47:21.810
No, no, no. That's...
That's okay. That's okay.

47:21.812 --> 47:23.845
See, a-as long
as you show up,

47:23.847 --> 47:26.848
I can come up with
the practice plans. Trust me.

47:26.850 --> 47:28.816
Okay.

47:28.818 --> 47:32.553
Uh, one question.
Is that child really 13?

47:32.555 --> 47:34.689
Oh, no. No.

47:34.691 --> 47:36.658
Ah. I don't think so.

47:36.660 --> 47:38.225
- Uh, second thing.
- Yeah.

47:38.227 --> 47:40.562
Do my arms really
look like Gracie's?

48:11.760 --> 48:13.696
Hey, what are you doing?

48:15.832 --> 48:17.765
Well I may not know
much about soccer,

48:17.767 --> 48:20.634
but I'm pretty good when
it comes to yardwork, so...

48:20.636 --> 48:23.470
Just don't tell
your mother.

48:23.472 --> 48:25.140
Get a rake. Let's go.

48:25.142 --> 48:26.875
Let's get this place
fixed up for you.

48:26.877 --> 48:29.477
We're doing the exact
same thing we did last night?

48:29.479 --> 48:31.479
- Yeah.
- Pretty much.

48:31.481 --> 48:33.283
- I don't care.
- It was fine.

48:36.886 --> 48:38.919
Is this ours?

48:38.921 --> 48:40.721
Whoa.

48:42.492 --> 48:45.261
Hey. What do you think?

48:49.332 --> 48:51.832
Welcome to the new home
of the Breakaways.

48:51.834 --> 48:53.935
Come on! Let's go!

48:58.341 --> 48:59.741
What's up, Bug?

48:59.743 --> 49:01.609
Wow. I'm getting
more practice.

49:06.649 --> 49:10.285
Okay. Okay, nice try, Gia.
But next time you should

49:10.287 --> 49:12.220
try to do the thing
with your foot.

49:12.222 --> 49:13.890
You wanna do the thing
like, um...

49:15.758 --> 49:17.625
You should try
a bending shot.

49:17.627 --> 49:20.194
You wanna open up like
you're gonna pass the ball,

49:20.196 --> 49:22.296
but follow through
like you're shooting it.

49:22.298 --> 49:23.964
Like you're shooting it
into the...

49:23.966 --> 49:25.832
- Okay, yep. Um...
- The...

49:25.834 --> 49:28.638
You mean like this, Dad?

49:32.908 --> 49:36.644
Yep. Just like...
Yep, just like that.

49:36.646 --> 49:40.314
Okay, for our next
drill, why don't you go ahead

49:40.316 --> 49:43.850
and, uh, ahem, you know,
show everybody, uh...

49:43.852 --> 49:45.787
what I taught you.

49:45.789 --> 49:47.488
When you go at an opponent,

49:47.490 --> 49:49.424
you wanna get them
off balance one way,

49:49.426 --> 49:50.892
and then go the other way.

49:50.894 --> 49:52.727
Too many people focus
on a fancy move,

49:52.729 --> 49:54.595
instead of the reason
you're doing the move

49:54.597 --> 49:56.798
in the first place:
beating your opponent.

49:56.800 --> 49:59.633
Keep it simple. Use balance
and a change of speed.

49:59.635 --> 50:02.403
Keep it simple. Use balance
and a change of speed.

50:02.405 --> 50:05.640
Wow. Reagan's dad
is an awesome coach.

50:05.642 --> 50:06.844
Mm-hm.

50:10.280 --> 50:11.712
Champion on three!

50:11.714 --> 50:15.250
Champion on three!
One, two, three, champions!

50:15.252 --> 50:18.519
Okay, guys, uh, just go out
and... And do your best, okay?

50:18.521 --> 50:23.857
Uh, I'm proud of you.
Win or lose, just have fun.

50:23.859 --> 50:26.261
Let's go. Have fun.
Get on out there.

50:26.263 --> 50:27.995
How come we don't have
a team cheer?

50:27.997 --> 50:29.863
Go team.

50:29.865 --> 50:31.466
You gonna dive
this time, Lexi?

50:31.468 --> 50:33.567
Yep! My mom gave me
some allergy medicine.

50:33.569 --> 50:35.502
- See? No sneezing.
- Ugh.

50:38.908 --> 50:41.779
Lexi! Wake up!

50:48.852 --> 50:51.519
- Over here, Bug.
- Go, go, go. There you go!

50:51.521 --> 50:52.919
There you go, girls!

50:52.921 --> 50:55.055
- Get it to Reagan!
- Let's go, Bug!

50:55.057 --> 50:56.723
Come on, Bug.
Bug, move over.

50:56.725 --> 50:58.493
Help Penny out.
Nice job, Penny.

50:58.495 --> 51:00.962
Nice. Nice.

51:00.964 --> 51:04.335
Regs! Move! Move!
Go, go, go!

51:06.836 --> 51:08.736
Whoa!
We're actually tied!

51:12.676 --> 51:14.042
Over here, Penny!

51:14.044 --> 51:15.942
I'm open. In the middle!

51:15.944 --> 51:17.812
Go, go, go. Go!

51:17.814 --> 51:21.316
Uh, last minute. One more
minute! One more minute!

51:21.318 --> 51:23.817
Defense, girls.
Defense, we need defense.

51:23.819 --> 51:26.953
Come on, girls! You've got this!
You've got this!

51:30.794 --> 51:33.727
Good game, ladies. A
lot of hustle out there.

51:33.729 --> 51:36.064
Everybody stop.

51:36.066 --> 51:38.598
Now what was the score
of our last game?

51:38.600 --> 51:40.535
Five to 1.

51:40.537 --> 51:42.837
- Before that?
- Like, 6-0.

51:42.839 --> 51:45.839
It was 2-1 today.

51:45.841 --> 51:48.475
We're getting better.
All right?

51:48.477 --> 51:50.477
We just need more
game experience.

51:50.479 --> 51:53.080
Against somebody good
that can push you guys.

51:53.082 --> 51:55.482
That's how good teams
get better.

51:58.120 --> 52:00.356
Yo! Spider girl!

52:01.857 --> 52:04.491
Thanks for coming.

52:04.493 --> 52:06.961
Ladies, today I want you
to welcome

52:06.963 --> 52:09.363
some of the boys
from United Real,

52:09.365 --> 52:12.966
who have come to our humble
field to practice with us

52:12.968 --> 52:14.435
because, uh...

52:14.437 --> 52:16.069
Because Alex Morgan said...

52:16.071 --> 52:18.105
- What?
- Huh?

52:18.107 --> 52:21.808
...um, in that...
In that training video,

52:21.810 --> 52:25.946
where she said she got
a lot out of training and...

52:25.948 --> 52:28.685
And... And practicing with...

52:30.086 --> 52:34.955
boys, uh, growing up.

52:34.957 --> 52:38.859
I mean, you remember, right?

52:38.861 --> 52:41.995
Yeah. I do now. I do now.

52:41.997 --> 52:43.830
I gotta get my hands
on all these

52:43.832 --> 52:45.566
Alex Morgan things
she's watching.

52:45.568 --> 52:46.901
- Mm-hm.
- Well, let's, uh...

52:46.903 --> 52:49.504
Let's play some soccer.
Come on, let's go.

52:49.506 --> 52:51.872
Let's go!
Come on, girls!

52:51.874 --> 52:54.142
Go, go, go.

The fake injury thing
was cheap.

54:04.481 --> 54:05.812
Agreed. But, uh,
I told you

54:05.814 --> 54:07.482
you didn't know
all my moves.

54:09.185 --> 54:11.017

Claire... Bishop.

54:22.198 --> 54:23.897
Why would you think that?

54:23.899 --> 54:28.602
I-I see you guys
together at school. A lot.

54:28.604 --> 54:33.207
Yeah. Because she kinda
shows up... a lot.

54:33.209 --> 54:36.042
So...

54:36.044 --> 54:37.178
you're not...?

54:37.180 --> 54:40.615
No. No. I, uh...

54:40.617 --> 54:43.283
met her at a tournament
a couple months ago.

54:43.285 --> 54:45.722
She is not my type.

54:48.725 --> 54:50.191
Where are we eating?

54:52.761 --> 54:55.162
That was fun.

54:55.164 --> 54:58.765
I'm good. I got this.

54:58.767 --> 55:01.134
I can't believe you scored
Dylan on a one-on-one.

55:01.136 --> 55:03.104
He just...

55:03.106 --> 55:05.705
So I know your favorite
player is Alex Morgan.

55:05.707 --> 55:07.941
- Right.
- How about favorite goals?

55:07.943 --> 55:09.644
Oh, okay, so that's easy.

55:09.646 --> 55:11.245
My first memory
of Alex Morgan,

55:11.247 --> 55:13.147
and it was in
the 2012 Olympics.

55:13.149 --> 55:16.883
US versus Canada. Remember when
they were all tied up, 3 to 3?

55:16.885 --> 55:19.287
- Yeah, yeah.
- They have less than 30 seconds to go

55:19.289 --> 55:21.254
before it would
come down to PKs, right?

55:21.256 --> 55:25.660
Then Abby Wambach got the ball
ten yards above the 18, right?

55:25.662 --> 55:28.296
But then she turned
to pass...

55:45.180 --> 55:47.747
GIA
Yeah! We won our first game!

55:49.218 --> 55:51.154
Hey, wait. Where's Reagan?

56:12.307 --> 56:14.977
Don't look at me.
She's your daughter.

56:21.883 --> 56:23.149
Did you see my goal?

56:23.151 --> 56:25.019
Great job. Although...

56:25.021 --> 56:26.187
Although what?

56:26.189 --> 56:28.055
You could have had
another goal

56:28.057 --> 56:31.625
if you would've used your left
instead of forcing your righty.

56:31.627 --> 56:33.828
You don't let anything slide,
do you?

56:33.830 --> 56:35.196
You want to be your best,

56:35.198 --> 56:37.698
or you want to be
a Natalie Gunderson?

56:40.102 --> 56:41.669
Hey!

56:41.671 --> 56:43.270
What do you want?
'Cause there's...

56:43.272 --> 56:44.404

56:58.421 --> 57:01.087
Thanks.

57:01.089 --> 57:03.857
Although I could've had
two goals instead of one

57:03.859 --> 57:06.093
if I'd shot with my left
instead of my right

57:06.095 --> 57:07.164
there at the end.

57:11.868 --> 57:14.200
So I know I'm new
to soccer and all,

57:14.202 --> 57:16.671
but, uh, there are a few things
I do understand

57:16.673 --> 57:17.971
about sports in general.

57:17.973 --> 57:20.676
Check the league standings.

57:24.379 --> 57:26.881
We got three points today
for the win, right?

57:26.883 --> 57:28.448
Mm-hm.

57:28.450 --> 57:31.451
Teams only have to finish in
the top four of their leagues

57:31.453 --> 57:33.323
to qualify for Diamond Cup.

57:38.861 --> 57:40.261
I'm just sayin'.

57:40.263 --> 57:42.395
There's still time.

57:42.397 --> 57:44.698
Diamond Cup. Us?

57:44.700 --> 57:47.834
- Us.
- It was just one win.

57:47.836 --> 57:50.303
No, it was just
our first win.

57:50.305 --> 57:53.040
I've always dreamed
of playing in the Diamond Cup.

57:53.042 --> 57:55.109
The top four teams
in each league

57:55.111 --> 57:56.743
are eligible.

57:56.745 --> 57:59.714
Fourth place. I think
we can get there.

57:59.716 --> 58:01.082
I know we can.

58:01.084 --> 58:03.850
Do you know where
the Diamond Cup finals are?

58:03.852 --> 58:05.919
Yeah,
Harris Field.

58:05.921 --> 58:08.022
Where the U.S. Women's
National Team trains

58:08.024 --> 58:09.256
when they're in town.

58:09.258 --> 58:11.758
I think the key
to making Diamond Cup

58:11.760 --> 58:13.961
is practicing more
with the boys team.

58:13.963 --> 58:15.395
Yeah. Definitely.

58:15.397 --> 58:18.031
Boys? Gross.

01:01:34.930 --> 01:01:38.165
We're so excited. I can't even
tell you how excited we are.

01:01:38.167 --> 01:01:40.633
Alex, I don't know
if I'm ready.

01:01:40.635 --> 01:01:43.069
We still need to improve.
I need to improve.

01:01:43.071 --> 01:01:44.571
Everyone always needs
to improve.

01:01:44.573 --> 01:01:46.372
I need to improve.

01:01:46.374 --> 01:01:49.176
Diamond Cup is the best girls
soccer teams in the state.

01:01:49.178 --> 01:01:51.377
- I wanna talk to you!
- Uh-oh.

01:01:51.379 --> 01:01:52.979
I'll be with you
the whole way.

01:01:52.981 --> 01:01:55.316
Hey, I'm talking to you.

01:01:55.318 --> 01:01:56.716
I'm not going anywhere.

01:01:56.718 --> 01:01:59.153
Even if I wasn't here,
you're enough, Reagan.

01:01:59.155 --> 01:02:00.553
Are you ignoring me?

01:02:00.555 --> 01:02:02.488
Me? You can't be
talking about me.

01:02:02.490 --> 01:02:06.093
Are you making fun of me?
Nobody ignores Claire Bishop.

01:02:06.095 --> 01:02:08.294
Maybe you'll pay attention
when I tell my dad

01:02:08.296 --> 01:02:10.564
to have his company
buy this lot.

01:02:13.269 --> 01:02:15.338
Hey!

01:02:17.073 --> 01:02:18.439
Stop!

01:02:21.310 --> 01:02:24.444
Reagan? Honey,
are you okay?

01:02:24.446 --> 01:02:26.479
Sweetheart, are you okay?

01:02:31.419 --> 01:02:32.519
Reagan.

01:02:32.521 --> 01:02:34.254
I'm okay.

01:02:34.256 --> 01:02:35.591
Uh...

01:02:36.725 --> 01:02:38.658
Alex?

01:02:40.296 --> 01:02:41.662
Alex?

01:02:41.664 --> 01:02:43.663
Alex!

01:02:43.665 --> 01:02:45.399
What did you do
with Alex Morgan?

01:02:45.401 --> 01:02:46.667
Have you seen Alex Morgan?

01:02:46.669 --> 01:02:48.638
What did you do with Alex?
Wha...?

01:02:51.506 --> 01:02:53.342
- Sweetheart...
- Oh, no.

01:02:54.642 --> 01:02:56.412
Wha...? Alex!

01:03:10.626 --> 01:03:12.392
Oh!

01:03:12.394 --> 01:03:14.363
Come on, please,
please, please, Alex.

01:03:15.430 --> 01:03:18.165
I can't do this without you.

01:03:18.167 --> 01:03:20.636
Oh, come on.

01:03:24.606 --> 01:03:26.242
Alex.

01:03:28.644 --> 01:03:30.310
I'm here.

01:03:30.312 --> 01:03:34.584
Ready. To practice
my left foot.

01:03:40.656 --> 01:03:42.225
Alex?

01:03:45.693 --> 01:03:48.731
Please. I need you.

01:03:56.071 --> 01:03:58.073
Reagan, let's go!

01:04:01.577 --> 01:04:03.743
- Do I have to?
- Yes.

01:04:03.745 --> 01:04:05.749
Come on.

01:04:22.198 --> 01:04:24.598
And I want to thank
you all for coming today.

01:04:24.600 --> 01:04:28.401
I mean, this has been
a really hard decision for me.

01:04:28.403 --> 01:04:30.136
But getting here to this point

01:04:30.138 --> 01:04:31.738
has been hard
on my entire family.

01:04:31.740 --> 01:04:35.609
My mom and dad both
have made so many sacrifices.

01:04:35.611 --> 01:04:39.279
Between games
and practices, camps.

01:04:39.281 --> 01:04:41.151
I mean, everything.

01:04:43.151 --> 01:04:44.450
And then my sister...

01:04:44.452 --> 01:04:45.551
Reagan.

01:04:47.356 --> 01:04:49.823
You know, I realized that
sometimes the spotlight on me

01:04:49.825 --> 01:04:52.125
maybe left a little bit
of a shadow on her.

01:04:52.127 --> 01:04:54.560
She's been one of my
big inspirations this season.

01:04:54.562 --> 01:04:56.296
You know,
her newfound dedication

01:04:56.298 --> 01:04:58.531
and practicing every morning
for her soccer,

01:04:58.533 --> 01:05:00.734
it made me work harder.

01:05:00.736 --> 01:05:02.502
She doesn't know this,

01:05:02.504 --> 01:05:04.671
but I started putting these
'goal charts' in my room

01:05:04.673 --> 01:05:09.308
just like she has in hers.
So thanks, sis.

01:05:09.310 --> 01:05:13.182
Now, as for where I'm gonna
play football in college...

01:05:34.769 --> 01:05:38.140
What, didn't believe me?

01:05:39.642 --> 01:05:43.176
Thanks again. For today.

01:05:43.178 --> 01:05:44.414
Come here.

01:05:50.218 --> 01:05:51.817
Can I ask you something?

01:05:51.819 --> 01:05:53.720
Shoot.

01:05:53.722 --> 01:05:58.725
I got Diamond Cup starting this
weekend, and I'm really nervous.

01:05:58.727 --> 01:06:00.794
Look, I still get
so nervous before games,

01:06:00.796 --> 01:06:02.462
I feel like I'm gonna throw up.

01:06:02.464 --> 01:06:04.267
No, you don't.

01:06:05.734 --> 01:06:07.935
- You do?
- Yeah.

01:06:07.937 --> 01:06:09.903
But you seem so calm.

01:06:09.905 --> 01:06:12.839
Well then it's working.

01:06:12.841 --> 01:06:14.176
What's working? Heh.

01:06:14.776 --> 01:06:15.878
My secret.

01:06:18.214 --> 01:06:19.482
Fake it 'til you make it.

01:06:21.216 --> 01:06:22.582
That's it?

01:06:22.584 --> 01:06:24.218
That's it.

01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:26.622
So when do you
stop being nervous?

01:06:29.658 --> 01:06:31.627
I'll let you know
when I make it.

01:06:52.714 --> 01:06:55.948
Go, go, go, Bombers!

01:06:55.950 --> 01:06:57.683
Okay, listen up.

01:06:57.685 --> 01:07:00.953
You guys just go out there and
do your best and have fun.

01:07:00.955 --> 01:07:03.290
And you remember:
you earned this.

01:07:03.292 --> 01:07:04.591
Now, let's go!

01:07:04.593 --> 01:07:06.392
- Come on! Let's go!
- Wait.

01:07:06.394 --> 01:07:08.895
All these other teams have
these great pregame cheers

01:07:08.897 --> 01:07:10.296
to get them pumped,

01:07:10.298 --> 01:07:12.466
and we just walk out
onto the field.

01:07:12.468 --> 01:07:15.035
She's got a point.
Any ideas, Bug?

01:07:15.037 --> 01:07:16.805
Just one. Come on.

01:07:18.740 --> 01:07:20.973
Soccer, soccer, that's our game!
Breakaways, Breakaways,

01:07:20.975 --> 01:07:23.509
that's our name!
You can't beat us, no you can't!

01:07:23.511 --> 01:07:26.580
Victory, victory, is our chant!
Hustle, hustle, we don't stop!

01:07:26.582 --> 01:07:29.283
Breakaways, to the top!
Say it with me, say it proud!

01:07:29.285 --> 01:07:31.785
- Breakaways, say it loud!
- Breakaways!

01:07:31.787 --> 01:07:35.488
- Whoo! All right.
- Who knew? Heh, heh.

01:07:35.490 --> 01:07:37.024
Let's go, girls!

01:07:41.964 --> 01:07:44.363
Nice job, Penny!
Good steal!

01:07:44.365 --> 01:07:45.999
- Okay, pass it!
- Penny! Penny!

01:07:46.001 --> 01:07:48.935
Lateral it over and just do
the lateral thing over to Bug!

01:07:48.937 --> 01:07:51.904
Come on, let's go! You got it,
take the shot! Take the shot!

01:07:51.906 --> 01:07:53.307
Just like that!
Touchdown!

01:07:53.309 --> 01:07:54.875
Go, go!

01:07:54.877 --> 01:07:56.575
Good job.

01:07:56.577 --> 01:07:59.712
Come on, Claire.
Come on. Come on.

01:07:59.714 --> 01:08:00.846
- Yeah!
- Yes!

01:08:03.919 --> 01:08:05.718
Penny, go!
Gia, watch 12!

01:08:05.720 --> 01:08:08.388
Watch 'em. Penny! Shoot!
Shoot it right now! Yeah!

01:08:08.390 --> 01:08:11.892
- Yes!
- Forty, 60, 80, one.

01:08:11.894 --> 01:08:14.961
That's how you earn it.
Good job. Mm.

01:08:14.963 --> 01:08:16.962
Good job, Crush.

01:08:16.964 --> 01:08:20.569
- Whoa. Nice shot.
- Way to go, Cindy.

01:08:22.104 --> 01:08:23.839
Hmph. Be
home by dinner.

01:08:28.109 --> 01:08:29.879
Okay, Lexi, stand tall.

01:08:46.095 --> 01:08:48.094
You go, Lexi! You go!

01:08:49.529 --> 01:08:51.932
Hey, hey, hey. Listen. Listen.

01:08:51.934 --> 01:08:54.401
You just made
Diamond Cup final.

01:08:55.970 --> 01:08:58.871
You are going to Harris Stadium
to play on the same field

01:08:58.872 --> 01:09:01.375
as the U.S. Women's
National team!

01:09:15.689 --> 01:09:17.091
Hey.

01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:19.459
You ready?

01:09:19.461 --> 01:09:21.663
Heh. No...

01:09:24.466 --> 01:09:26.133
Totally.

01:09:26.135 --> 01:09:28.604
That's what I'm talking about.

01:09:58.167 --> 01:10:00.032
All right, girls. Let's work.

01:10:00.034 --> 01:10:01.136
Knees up!

01:10:02.870 --> 01:10:05.074
Winners always do knees up!

01:10:06.842 --> 01:10:09.812
Yeah, let's go, number 9.
Let's go, 12.

01:10:10.645 --> 01:10:12.045
Karaoke time.

01:10:12.047 --> 01:10:14.514
You know what I'm singin'.

01:10:14.516 --> 01:10:15.849
You know
what I'm singin'.

01:10:15.851 --> 01:10:17.754
Winners always do sides.

01:10:18.954 --> 01:10:20.123
Winners
always stretch.

01:10:21.757 --> 01:10:23.490
That's right.

01:10:23.492 --> 01:10:25.591
Good job, Bug. Good
job, lookin' ready.

01:10:25.593 --> 01:10:27.760
Stay on your toes.
There you go.

01:10:27.762 --> 01:10:29.662
All right, girls,
you got this, okay?

01:10:29.664 --> 01:10:31.497
Just play your game.
All right?

01:10:31.499 --> 01:10:33.066
I'm proud of you.
Just play hard.

01:10:33.068 --> 01:10:35.868
Nice, Reagan.
Nice touches.

01:10:35.870 --> 01:10:37.737
She's ready.

01:10:37.739 --> 01:10:40.143
I know. And she stopped talking
to herself.

01:10:43.645 --> 01:10:46.179
Claire's dad has been taking
some high-angle footage

01:10:46.181 --> 01:10:48.915
of the Breakaway games.

01:10:48.917 --> 01:10:54.254
Watch 13, watch 13,
watch 13, watch 13.

01:10:54.256 --> 01:10:55.958
She's dangerous.

01:10:57.124 --> 01:10:58.892
Take away her right.

01:10:58.894 --> 01:11:02.161
Today, you girls
are gonna pull off

01:11:02.163 --> 01:11:06.032
the greatest sporting upset
since Mike Eruzione, Jim Craig,

01:11:06.034 --> 01:11:08.635
and the rest of the Americans
beat the Russians.

01:11:08.637 --> 01:11:10.706
- And as Herb Brooks said...
- Who?

01:11:12.207 --> 01:11:14.577
The 1980 U.S.
Olympic hockey team.

01:11:16.744 --> 01:11:17.846
Lake Placid?

01:11:20.181 --> 01:11:23.051
"Do you believe in miracles?
Yes!"

01:11:23.784 --> 01:11:25.551
No?

01:11:25.553 --> 01:11:27.286
We weren't born then.

01:11:27.288 --> 01:11:29.656
My dad wasn't born then.

01:11:29.658 --> 01:11:31.825
Right. Okay.

01:11:31.827 --> 01:11:33.225
One! Two! Three!

01:11:33.227 --> 01:11:35.027
Crush! Kick! Destroy!

01:11:35.029 --> 01:11:37.730
Say it with me, say it proud!
Breakaways, Breakaways,

01:11:37.732 --> 01:11:39.633
- say it loud!
- Breakaways!

01:11:39.635 --> 01:11:41.300
Let's go, girls. Come on, girls.

01:11:41.302 --> 01:11:43.702
Crush soccer time!
No mercy, no loss.

01:11:44.873 --> 01:11:46.939
Hey, Reg. Have fun!

01:11:51.079 --> 01:11:53.846
Oh, my dad's company is gonna
look into buying that lot

01:11:53.848 --> 01:11:55.916
across from your house.

01:11:57.319 --> 01:11:59.318
Come on, Claire.
You know what to do.

01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:01.720
All right, let's play our style.
Our style.

01:12:01.722 --> 01:12:03.557
Go, Penny, go!

01:12:03.559 --> 01:12:04.991
Pass it! Pass it! Come on!

01:12:04.993 --> 01:12:06.792
Teacup, what are you doing?

01:12:06.794 --> 01:12:08.661
That's good, Penny. That's good.

01:12:08.663 --> 01:12:10.930
Get it in there. Get it up.
Get it up. Come on!

01:12:10.932 --> 01:12:12.165
Steal! Steal!

01:12:12.167 --> 01:12:13.599
You go, girl!

01:12:13.601 --> 01:12:16.135
All right, all right, all right.

01:12:16.137 --> 01:12:18.705
Nice, Gia!

01:12:18.707 --> 01:12:21.707
Come on, come on, Penny.
Back it up! Back it up!

01:12:21.709 --> 01:12:23.108
Go, Claire! Go, go!

01:12:23.110 --> 01:12:25.245
Here we go. Here we go!

01:12:25.247 --> 01:12:26.880
Whoo!

01:12:26.882 --> 01:12:29.085
Ha, ha! Thattagirl!

01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:33.652
Lexi, it's okay.

01:12:33.654 --> 01:12:35.921
Hey! That's okay.
It's just one.

01:12:35.923 --> 01:12:37.290
It's just one. That's okay.

01:12:37.292 --> 01:12:39.192
Come on, teamwork!

01:12:39.194 --> 01:12:40.993
That a baby, Claire!

01:12:40.995 --> 01:12:43.098
Hey. Remember.

01:12:45.766 --> 01:12:47.970
Still not getting my usual 25.

01:12:52.306 --> 01:12:55.675
Crush! You know what that means.

01:12:55.677 --> 01:12:57.077
Get in there! Come on!

01:12:59.647 --> 01:13:00.982
Nice job!

01:13:03.718 --> 01:13:05.218
- Oh!
- Oh!

01:13:05.220 --> 01:13:07.653
Okay, no bounce,
no bounce, no bounce!

01:13:07.655 --> 01:13:10.122
Agh! Okay, no second bounce.

01:13:10.124 --> 01:13:12.791
Good, good.

01:13:12.793 --> 01:13:15.228
All right, move
it up, move it up.

01:13:15.230 --> 01:13:18.031
On it! See, Penny? Get in there.

01:13:18.033 --> 01:13:19.099
Nice job, Penny.

01:13:19.101 --> 01:13:21.635
Come around, Gia. There you go.

01:13:21.637 --> 01:13:23.803
Go, go, go!

01:13:23.805 --> 01:13:25.671
Looking good.

01:13:25.673 --> 01:13:27.340
Good teamwork!
There you go, Penny!

01:13:27.342 --> 01:13:30.276
Very good, Gia. There you go.
Gia, come down, help her out.

01:13:30.278 --> 01:13:32.379
- Here we go! Here we go!
- Watch her!

01:13:32.381 --> 01:13:33.783
Watch, don't let her kick!

01:13:34.882 --> 01:13:37.216
Crush!

01:13:37.218 --> 01:13:39.184
Boom! Yes!

01:13:39.186 --> 01:13:40.319
That's how you do it.

01:13:40.321 --> 01:13:44.157
That is a Bishop in the house.

01:13:44.159 --> 01:13:46.929
That a way, Claire. Whoo!

01:13:50.399 --> 01:13:53.066
Jog off, jog off!
Winners always jog off.

01:13:53.068 --> 01:13:55.001
Don't give up.
All right?

01:13:55.003 --> 01:13:57.303
We've got a second half to play.
It's not over.

01:13:57.305 --> 01:13:58.772
'Cause we have time.

01:13:58.774 --> 01:14:00.740
And time is good,
because with time,

01:14:00.742 --> 01:14:03.042
you have time,
and time is...

01:14:03.044 --> 01:14:05.944
Is... Is the opposite
of not time. Which would be....

01:14:05.946 --> 01:14:09.081
You know who won
Diamond Cup last year?

01:14:09.083 --> 01:14:10.149
Crush.

01:14:10.151 --> 01:14:12.419
Yeah, Crush.

01:14:12.421 --> 01:14:15.354
You know who the runner up was?

01:14:15.356 --> 01:14:18.358
Hm?

01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:23.429
If we lose today, nobody will
remember what we did.

01:14:23.431 --> 01:14:28.434
We'll just go back to being
known as the girls who got cut.

01:14:28.436 --> 01:14:31.136
The players nobody wanted.

01:14:31.138 --> 01:14:34.139
The ones Crush makes fun of.

01:14:34.141 --> 01:14:37.379
And maybe that's who we are.

01:14:39.080 --> 01:14:40.982
Or maybe not.

01:14:44.186 --> 01:14:49.022
Because today is our chance to
force the Claire's of the world

01:14:49.024 --> 01:14:52.826
and everybody else to call us
what we really are:

01:14:52.828 --> 01:14:57.397
not Breakaways,
but champions.

01:14:57.399 --> 01:14:59.765
Now, let's get out there
and show 'em!

01:14:59.767 --> 01:15:01.302
Yeah!

01:15:02.937 --> 01:15:03.937
Anything to add?

01:15:03.939 --> 01:15:05.371
No, that was great.

01:15:05.373 --> 01:15:07.307
That...? Was that
an Alex Morgan speech?

01:15:07.309 --> 01:15:09.843
No. It was a Reagan speech.

01:15:11.113 --> 01:15:12.911
Have fun, girls.

01:15:12.913 --> 01:15:15.283
Play hard. Okay?
Just play hard. Do your best.

01:15:25.159 --> 01:15:27.059
Sweet mother of pearl.

01:15:27.061 --> 01:15:28.894
Do...? Do they have
practice later?

01:15:28.896 --> 01:15:30.265
Are they gonna watch us?

01:15:42.511 --> 01:15:44.277
Reagan!

01:15:44.279 --> 01:15:45.944
Regs!

01:15:45.946 --> 01:15:47.749
Fake it.

01:15:53.355 --> 01:15:54.920
Okay, let's finish them off.

01:15:54.922 --> 01:15:56.990
- Finish them off.
- Get in there, Penny!

01:15:56.992 --> 01:15:58.491
Get in there!

01:15:58.493 --> 01:15:59.492
Ooh!

01:16:03.164 --> 01:16:07.002
Steal! Steal, ladies.
Steal. Steal!

01:16:09.937 --> 01:16:12.037
For crying out
loud, Logan. Heh.

01:16:12.039 --> 01:16:13.473
Come on, move! Move!

01:16:13.475 --> 01:16:15.441
- Reagan, Reagan!
- Ladies, ladies.

01:16:15.443 --> 01:16:16.745
Nice job!

01:16:18.346 --> 01:16:19.515
Pretty good.

01:16:21.382 --> 01:16:22.982
Let's take it home, girls.

01:16:22.984 --> 01:16:25.117
Go, Reagan! Go, go!

01:16:25.119 --> 01:16:26.486
Go, Reagan! Go, Reagan!

01:16:26.488 --> 01:16:28.353
- No. No!
- Go, Reagan!

01:16:28.355 --> 01:16:30.089
There you go.
Go, Reagan!

01:16:30.091 --> 01:16:31.456
Good job! Good job!

01:16:31.458 --> 01:16:32.826
There! You did it!

01:16:32.828 --> 01:16:34.093
Way to go, Reagan!

01:16:38.900 --> 01:16:40.500
That's a foul!

01:16:40.502 --> 01:16:42.969
Wait, does anybody
know how to play defense?

01:16:42.971 --> 01:16:46.408
Believe. Believe. Believe.

01:16:48.843 --> 01:16:50.242
Come on!

01:16:51.245 --> 01:16:53.345
Go, Bug!

01:16:53.347 --> 01:16:54.546
Bug, go!

01:16:54.548 --> 01:16:56.484
Bug, cross!
Bug, cross to Penny!

01:17:01.355 --> 01:17:02.388
No!

01:17:02.390 --> 01:17:03.423
Claire!

01:17:03.425 --> 01:17:05.258
What are you doing out there?

01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:07.393
Sweetheart, you're gonna
have to get off the field

01:17:07.395 --> 01:17:09.531
- if you're gonna play that way.
- Stop.

01:17:12.066 --> 01:17:13.433
- Whoo!
- Yes!

01:17:13.435 --> 01:17:15.937
Way to go, Breakaways!
Way to go!

01:17:24.145 --> 01:17:25.978
Back, back, back, back!

01:17:25.980 --> 01:17:28.850
Time for one more push.
One more push, Reagan!

01:17:31.019 --> 01:17:34.222
Stop her! Come on!

01:17:36.958 --> 01:17:38.358
Push her to her right.

01:17:38.360 --> 01:17:40.326
Push her to her right.
She has no left!

01:17:40.328 --> 01:17:42.565
Hit it up! Come on!

01:17:50.471 --> 01:17:52.971
Yeah! Yeah!

01:18:21.636 --> 01:18:23.172
Claire.

01:18:24.638 --> 01:18:27.674
Claire.
Let's go.

01:18:27.676 --> 01:18:29.442
Let's go.

01:18:29.444 --> 01:18:31.477
You've got game
footage to look at.

01:18:31.479 --> 01:18:33.481
Both cameras. Let's go.

01:18:52.434 --> 01:18:53.499
Aw, shoot.

01:18:53.501 --> 01:18:55.233
Forgot my backpack.

01:18:55.235 --> 01:18:57.472
Go ahead. I'll meet you guys
in the parking lot.

01:19:05.312 --> 01:19:08.016
Hey. I just wanted
to tell you: nice left.

01:19:10.150 --> 01:19:11.386
Thank you.

01:19:12.287 --> 01:19:14.754
Th-Thanks.

01:19:14.756 --> 01:19:17.490
I... I couldn't have done it
without you, Alex.

01:19:17.492 --> 01:19:19.461
What do you mean?
You just did.

01:19:22.329 --> 01:19:23.932
You don't...?

01:19:26.001 --> 01:19:27.433
Maybe it wasn't real.

01:19:27.435 --> 01:19:29.104
What wasn't real?

01:19:30.372 --> 01:19:32.537
You...

01:19:32.539 --> 01:19:36.642
You inspired me
and helped me get here today.

01:19:36.644 --> 01:19:39.315
Thanks. That means a lot.

01:19:43.051 --> 01:19:44.386
Do I know you?

01:19:45.253 --> 01:19:47.420
Feels like it, huh?

01:19:47.422 --> 01:19:52.394
Yeah, it's...
You remind me of me.

01:19:54.662 --> 01:19:58.031
Can I ask you something?

01:19:58.033 --> 01:19:59.665
A favor?

01:19:59.667 --> 01:20:02.434
It's kind of a big one?

01:20:02.436 --> 01:20:03.604
Sure.

01:20:07.609 --> 01:20:09.375
Good job.

01:20:09.377 --> 01:20:11.411
But I think it's time
to move on to the next level.

01:20:11.413 --> 01:20:12.411
Who's next?

01:20:12.413 --> 01:20:14.246
Me!

01:20:14.248 --> 01:20:16.148
Okay, we're doing two-a-touch.
Are you ready?

01:20:16.150 --> 01:20:18.653
- Yeah!
- Perfect.

01:20:22.656 --> 01:20:25.026
I scored a lot of goals
last season. Heh.

01:20:28.462 --> 01:20:30.365
Thanks. Heh.

01:20:32.833 --> 01:20:34.434
Dad!

01:20:34.436 --> 01:20:35.768
You're not gonna believe it.

01:20:35.770 --> 01:20:37.373
Claire made a donation.

01:20:42.776 --> 01:20:44.178
Thank you, Claire.

01:20:45.646 --> 01:20:48.781
Uh, can I get everyone's
attention, please?

01:20:48.783 --> 01:20:52.385
Uh, first off, I want to say
a very special thank you

01:20:52.387 --> 01:20:55.388
to Alex Morgan for being here
and donating her time today.

01:20:55.390 --> 01:20:56.788
Thank you, Alex.

01:20:56.790 --> 01:20:58.224
Thanks, guys.

01:20:58.226 --> 01:21:00.093
And to all of you

01:21:00.095 --> 01:21:04.563
who have come here today
to help us save our field,

01:21:04.565 --> 01:21:07.567
because we did it.
