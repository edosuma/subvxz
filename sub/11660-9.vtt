(mellow music playing)

00:56.734 --> 00:58.967
Ohh.

01:01.734 --> 01:04.266
Ohhh!

01:04.333 --> 01:07.233
Hey! You're not even going to ask
what's wrong?

01:07.300 --> 01:09.767
-What's wrong, Ma?
-I've got three days to live.

01:09.834 --> 01:13.066
I'll scratch Bengay
off the grocery list.

01:19.100 --> 01:22.767
-I can't believe you're so insensitive.
-Ma, you aren't dying.

01:22.834 --> 01:27.033
I am, Dorothy.
Your father spoke to me in a dream.

01:27.100 --> 01:30.633
-Spoke to you? How?
-Do I look like Rich Little?

01:31.800 --> 01:32.934
Just listen.

01:34.333 --> 01:37.200
I'm sitting in the living room,
and the clock strikes 9:00.

01:37.667 --> 01:40.533
Then the bell rings.
It's your father in his fedora.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.266
He always wore it on Saturday.

01:42.934 --> 01:45.033
He walks towards me and says,

01:45.100 --> 01:49.567
"Sophia... you can come now.
There's room now."

01:49.633 --> 01:51.400
-That's it?
-You want him to show up

01:51.467 --> 01:53.834
with the all-American football team?

01:55.133 --> 01:57.166
It's a dream not a Bob Hope special.

01:58.000 --> 02:00.433
I'm dying Saturday, 9:00.
Don't make any plans.

02:00.500 --> 02:03.266
-Ma, you're being ridiculous.
-I know.

02:03.667 --> 02:05.967
When was the last Saturday night
you had plans?

02:09.066 --> 02:13.166
-Thank you, Dorothy. Those look lovely.
-So do you.

02:13.233 --> 02:17.033
Blanche, you really got dressed up
for your brother.

02:17.100 --> 02:18.800
We're from the south.

02:18.867 --> 02:22.800
We always felt it was important
to look great for company.

02:22.867 --> 02:25.400
Hi, girls.
When's Clayton getting here?

02:25.467 --> 02:26.734
Any minute now.

02:27.133 --> 02:31.200
-We better lay the welcome mat.
-We don't have one.

02:31.266 --> 02:34.033
What about the one Dorothy says is at
the foot of your bed?

02:42.533 --> 02:44.800
-(doorbell rings)
-Oh! There's Clayton now.

02:44.867 --> 02:48.300
Remember, no remarks
about his marriage breaking up.

02:48.367 --> 02:49.600
He's still touchy.

02:51.533 --> 02:56.567
-Clayton! Baby brother!
-Sister! Oh, look at you.

02:56.633 --> 03:01.734
Prettier than a spring-blooming
peach tree on a dewy April morning.

03:01.800 --> 03:05.533
Well, you ought to talk,
all fresh-scrubbed and rosy-cheeked

03:05.600 --> 03:08.700
like a country parson
in a September hoedown.

03:09.667 --> 03:14.133
I get the feeling they had a maid
named Honeybee when they grew up.

03:15.734 --> 03:18.967
Come in and meet
my best friends Dorothy and Rose.

03:19.033 --> 03:24.166
-Dorothy. Rose, so nice to see you.
-How was your trip?

03:24.233 --> 03:28.834
-Went by in no time.
-That means he met a stewardess he liked.

03:28.900 --> 03:31.834
-Blanche.
-Lunch, dinner, or drinks?

03:31.900 --> 03:33.166
Dinner.

03:33.233 --> 03:35.800
I'm beginning to see
the family resemblance.

03:36.767 --> 03:41.767
I'll get you all settled, then I'll tell
you about our wonderful plans.

03:41.834 --> 03:45.300
Ok.
It was so nice finally meeting you all.

03:45.367 --> 03:47.367
See you later, Clayton.

03:47.433 --> 03:51.433
It's nice seeing a brother and sister
as good friends.

03:51.500 --> 03:53.033
Oh, it certainly is.

03:53.100 --> 03:56.734
I always wished that I could've been
closer to my brother Phil.

03:56.800 --> 04:00.100
You know, go places together,
share experiences.

04:00.166 --> 04:02.700
Although I did love borrowing his clothes.

04:03.133 --> 04:05.333
Did you like wearing boys' clothes?

04:05.400 --> 04:08.333
No, but fortunately,
neither did my brother Phil.

04:10.700 --> 04:17.533
(calm music playing)

04:21.033 --> 04:23.500
Why are you sitting here in the dark?

04:23.567 --> 04:26.734
Conserving electricity for those
who'll live past Saturday.

04:26.800 --> 04:28.033
Oh, Ma.

04:28.934 --> 04:31.233
-Put out your hands.
-What for?

04:31.300 --> 04:33.467
So I can say hello like Magic Johnson.

04:34.533 --> 04:36.533
So can I give you my personal things?

04:36.600 --> 04:41.166
-My bankbook, some stocks--
-Oh, Ma, this is crazy!

04:41.233 --> 04:44.633
-Hi, y'all.
-Fabulous. Roy and Dale are back.

04:47.100 --> 04:51.467
-So where are you two off to tonight?
-That's a surprise,

04:51.533 --> 04:54.400
wait, isn't that my silver locket
in there?

04:54.467 --> 04:57.300
Nice getting to know you, gomer.
See you around.

04:58.934 --> 05:03.633
-What's this about a surprise?
-Well, I've done a little matchmaking.

05:03.700 --> 05:06.266
-Blanche, not again.
-Yes, again!

05:06.333 --> 05:10.200
You're 45 years old.
You've been single almost two years.

05:10.266 --> 05:14.333
Both Dorothy and I know
how fun the single life is.

05:14.734 --> 05:19.767
Many's the night Dorothy has sat here
alone watching me go out on dates.

05:20.734 --> 05:23.233
Sometimes I watch her
from the kitchen window.

05:23.300 --> 05:26.300
It's easier to bay at the moon from there.

05:27.300 --> 05:31.066
I don't want you being afraid
to get back on that horse.

05:31.133 --> 05:34.300
-(doorbell rings)
-Here's your horse pulling up.

05:36.333 --> 05:40.367
Hello, Lois. Come in.
Remember Lois Lemans from the museum?

05:40.433 --> 05:43.500
-Nice to see you again.
-Oh, it's a pleasure.

05:43.567 --> 05:45.500
Now, you two can
get reacquainted on the way.

05:45.567 --> 05:51.133
These are your tickets for the concert.
It starts in 15 minutes, so hurry. Bye.

05:51.200 --> 05:52.367
Good night.

05:53.233 --> 05:57.934
I was never any good at blind dating.
I always felt so awkward.

05:58.000 --> 06:03.734
Oh, Dorothy, I have a sure-fire icebreaker
I can teach you right now.

06:03.800 --> 06:07.266
Once you learn this any man
is putty in your hands.

06:07.333 --> 06:09.500
Oh, Blanche, come on, that is ridiculous.

06:09.567 --> 06:14.533
I am certainly not going to waste my time
listening to this adolescent nonsense.

06:14.600 --> 06:16.000
Did you say putty?

06:17.400 --> 06:18.600
Sit back.

06:19.367 --> 06:21.300
Now, just pretend we're at the movies.

06:22.400 --> 06:27.567
Ok, first, I start to yawn a little. Ahh.

06:28.700 --> 06:30.633
Then I put my hands
up over my head like--

06:30.700 --> 06:34.033
Oh, Blanche, I know that one.
You end up with your arm around me.

06:34.100 --> 06:35.500
Yeah, but that's just the first part.

06:36.467 --> 06:41.300
Did you know that if you blow
right on the tip of a man's earlobe,

06:41.367 --> 06:44.467
-it can drive him absolutely crazy?
-No.

06:44.533 --> 06:45.967
I'll show you.

07:07.000 --> 07:08.867
I'm gonna be dead in 24 hours,

07:08.934 --> 07:11.266
couldn't you stay in
the closet for one more day?

07:12.567 --> 07:18.367
(serene music playing)

07:18.433 --> 07:23.367
-Rose, what are you doing here?
-Late night at the counseling center.

07:23.433 --> 07:28.200
-Didn't Blanche send you on a date?
-Oh, she did.

07:28.266 --> 07:29.266
Didn't it work out?

07:29.333 --> 07:34.266
Blanche thinks she knows
the type for me. She's way off.

07:34.333 --> 07:38.367
I'll bet I could sit here for a minute
and tell you your type.

07:38.433 --> 07:40.033
I am good at this.

07:40.500 --> 07:42.834
-Gosh, I'm stuck.
-You haven't even started.

07:42.900 --> 07:46.567
No, I'm stuck on the gum
somebody left on this bench.

07:49.333 --> 07:53.200
Give me your honest reactions
when people pass.

07:53.266 --> 07:54.734
-That's how I'll tell.
-Ok.

07:55.467 --> 07:56.633
Here's one.

07:58.934 --> 08:00.066
No. Too thin.

08:01.367 --> 08:02.667
Here comes one.

08:06.834 --> 08:09.433
Too short? Next.

08:15.266 --> 08:16.800
Oh, Clayton.

08:17.934 --> 08:20.667
Clayton, you're not playing fair.
That's a man.

08:22.166 --> 08:24.567
That's a man, and you're a man.

08:25.400 --> 08:26.734
You're both men.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.200
Clayton, you know that thing
that everyone said

08:36.266 --> 08:39.333
Olga Larson's nephew was
because he wore paisley clogs

08:39.400 --> 08:42.133
and gave out puff pastry on Halloween?

08:43.400 --> 08:44.900
I've been called a lot
of things in my time,

08:44.967 --> 08:46.700
but that's a first for that one.

08:47.300 --> 08:50.900
-Yeah, I'm gay, Rose.
-But Blanche told us you were married.

08:50.967 --> 08:54.867
I was. After a while I just couldn't deny
the truth to myself.

08:54.934 --> 08:57.533
Seems silly, still denying it to my big
sister, doesn't it?

08:57.600 --> 09:00.900
-Well, have you tried telling her?
-Every time I see her.

09:00.967 --> 09:02.600
And always chicken out.

09:03.567 --> 09:08.500
Oh, well, I know Blanche.
I mean, she'd be upset, but not for long.

09:08.834 --> 09:11.400
And just think how it would
help you two in the long run.

09:11.467 --> 09:15.533
-But how do I keep from chickening out?
-By telling her.

09:15.600 --> 09:17.834
Tonight, while you
still got you dander up.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.066
I'm sorry.

09:29.433 --> 09:32.066
-Did I say something embarrassing?
-No.

09:32.867 --> 09:35.800
No, Rose, you're right,
you're absolutely right.

09:35.867 --> 09:37.500
I got to tell her tonight.

09:38.066 --> 09:40.934
But it's not going to be easy.
I still haven't told Blanche

09:41.000 --> 09:43.133
I was the one who stole
the Montgomery Clift poster

09:43.200 --> 09:45.367
off her wall when she left for collage.

09:47.033 --> 09:51.667
(mellow music playing)

09:51.734 --> 09:56.333
(TV playing)

09:56.400 --> 10:00.433
-Why are you up?
-Someone left the lock off my cage.

10:04.567 --> 10:08.767
-I was afraid I'd have that dream again.
-Why are you up?

10:08.834 --> 10:12.166
I want to make sure
Clayton had fun tonight.

10:12.233 --> 10:15.567
-We're very close.
-That's sweet, Blanche.

10:18.166 --> 10:22.400
-Evening, ladies.
-Clayton Hollingsworth, it's about time.

10:22.467 --> 10:25.433
You and your date must have hit it off.

10:25.500 --> 10:27.800
Hey, Rose, what are
you doing with Clayton?

10:27.867 --> 10:30.800
-I ran into him.
-Where's Lois?

10:30.867 --> 10:35.000
-She went home. We weren't suited.
-Not suited?

10:35.700 --> 10:37.633
Sometimes I don't understand you.

10:37.700 --> 10:40.934
Time after time, I fix you up
with attractive, eligible women,

10:41.000 --> 10:42.600
and nothing happens.

10:42.667 --> 10:46.066
It's time you found a woman.
What's the matter with you?

10:47.233 --> 10:50.100
-Tell her, Clayton.
-I will, Rose.

10:52.600 --> 10:56.233
-Tell what?
-Well, I ran into Rose in the park,

10:56.300 --> 10:57.333
and, uh...

10:58.667 --> 11:02.567
-And?
-And we had a long talk, and, uh...

11:03.567 --> 11:05.900
-And?
-And...

11:06.467 --> 11:08.166
we slept together tonight.

11:23.834 --> 11:29.700
(mellow music playing)

11:31.233 --> 11:35.633
Dorothy, that stuff about preparing
for a burial, forget it.

11:35.700 --> 11:39.934
-Ma, you finally came to your senses.
-Yes.

11:40.000 --> 11:43.667
-I decided to be cremated instead.
-Oh, Ma.

11:44.300 --> 11:45.333
Oh.

11:45.400 --> 11:50.567
My ashes can be divided among you,
your brother Phil, and your sister Gloria.

11:51.734 --> 11:54.867
Nah, forget Gloria.
I don't want to spread myself to thin.

11:58.166 --> 12:02.333
-Hi, girls. I need to talk.
-Oh, honey, what is it?

12:02.800 --> 12:07.600
All day long, Blanche has given me looks.
She's really mad.

12:07.667 --> 12:12.600
What happened between you and Clayton
last night is your business,

12:12.667 --> 12:13.667
not Blanche's.

12:13.734 --> 12:17.834
That's just the point.
Nothing happened between Clayton and me.

12:17.900 --> 12:19.600
Nothing physical, anyway.

12:20.734 --> 12:23.867
Why did Clayton say
you two slept together, if you hadn't?

12:23.934 --> 12:28.333
He's trying to hide something
about himself from Blanche.

12:28.767 --> 12:33.400
I don't feel right saying it out loud.
Maybe if I just whispered it.

12:43.600 --> 12:45.900
Clayton is a hobo?

12:58.000 --> 12:59.667
No, Dorothy.

13:03.367 --> 13:06.834
Oh! Oh, now I get it!

13:06.900 --> 13:09.900
Good. I thought I'd have to
draw a picture.

13:12.800 --> 13:14.767
I'm not sure I'd know how.

13:18.767 --> 13:22.066
-Hey! I don't get to know?
-No, Ma.

13:22.767 --> 13:26.734
Have it your way, but nobody can keep
a secret from Sophia Petrillo.

13:26.800 --> 13:30.734
Whatever that guy's hiding, I can smoke it
out in a few quick questions.

13:31.967 --> 13:34.166
-Hello, ladies.
-Perfect timing.

13:34.233 --> 13:35.233
Ma.

13:36.367 --> 13:40.066
So, Clayton, what do you think
of this Miami weather?

13:40.133 --> 13:42.800
-It's lovely.
-I see.

13:44.367 --> 13:48.633
-Ever been to Europe?
-No. It's always been my dream.

13:48.700 --> 13:49.934
Interesting.

13:51.834 --> 13:54.900
-How many fingers am I holding up?
-Two?

13:55.000 --> 13:56.000
Fine.

13:56.066 --> 13:57.800
You can go back in the living room.

14:05.600 --> 14:08.667
The man's as gay as a picnic basket.

14:18.667 --> 14:21.867
Ma, that is... that is incredible.

14:21.934 --> 14:23.500
How did you know?

14:23.567 --> 14:24.967
I heard him singing in the shower.

14:25.033 --> 14:29.333
He's the only man I ever knew who knows
all the words to "Send in the Clowns"<i>.</i>

14:37.033 --> 14:40.433
-Rose, I owe you an apology.
-You sure do.

14:40.500 --> 14:45.600
You shouldn't be involved in this.
It's just hard to tell Blanche the truth.

14:45.667 --> 14:48.233
You're selling your sister short.

14:48.734 --> 14:52.934
At times, Blanche can be
very understanding and compassionate

14:53.000 --> 14:54.300
and forgiving.

14:54.367 --> 14:58.300
Get away from my baby brother,
you cradle-snatching, empty-headed,

14:58.367 --> 14:59.800
two-faced dummy.

15:02.467 --> 15:04.834
And at other times,
she can be a real bitch.

15:10.700 --> 15:14.367
-Blanche, there's something--
-Butt out! This doesn't concern you.

15:14.433 --> 15:16.667
I most certainly does concern him!

15:16.734 --> 15:19.333
Why? Because he was seduced
by a bubblehead

15:19.400 --> 15:22.500
whose hair looks colorized by Ted Turner?

15:23.533 --> 15:25.600
-Now, just a minute--
-Butt out, Clayton.

15:25.667 --> 15:27.066
This doesn't concern you.

15:27.433 --> 15:30.033
You'll really regret this
when you come begging

15:30.100 --> 15:32.166
on hands and knees for forgiveness.

15:32.233 --> 15:36.633
Then I'll never regret it
because I'll never apologize.

15:39.433 --> 15:40.900
We'll see about that.

15:42.700 --> 15:47.033
-I wish you hadn't done that.
-It was for your own good.

15:47.100 --> 15:50.734
-There's something you don't understand.
-Oh, I understand perfectly.

15:50.800 --> 15:55.066
I pushed you into meeting all those women.
That's why this happened.

15:55.133 --> 15:58.600
But it is over. Rose will be fine.

15:58.667 --> 16:01.633
-It's not as simple--
-Honey, leave it alone.

16:01.700 --> 16:02.900
Blanche, listen.

16:03.533 --> 16:08.700
Nothing happened between me and Rose...
just like nothing ever happens

16:08.767 --> 16:11.300
between me and any women
you set me up with.

16:11.834 --> 16:15.300
-There's a reason.
-What are you saying, Clayton?

16:15.367 --> 16:21.967
-I'm saying I'm gay, Blanche.
-Oh, please be serious.

16:22.667 --> 16:26.367
You're just saying that so I won't set you
up with any more women.

16:26.433 --> 16:27.967
No, Blanche.

16:28.000 --> 16:31.934
-Then you're saying it to get back at me.
-Blanche...

16:32.000 --> 16:34.800
clay, I know you too well for this.

16:34.867 --> 16:39.000
I know it can't be true.
You're my brother.

16:39.066 --> 16:40.533
It's true, Blanche.

16:42.433 --> 16:44.900
Maybe I should leave you
alone for a while.

16:45.333 --> 16:46.600
Clayton Hollingsworth...

16:47.734 --> 16:52.300
you look me in the face and tell me you
really are what you just said.

16:53.266 --> 16:55.667
I think you heard me the first time.

16:58.967 --> 17:04.100
(calm music playing)

17:04.166 --> 17:08.700
-Hey, Harry, flip on the game, will you.
-Not another game.

17:09.333 --> 17:13.066
-Come on, Tina, let's go.
-I'll see you back at the house.

17:27.066 --> 17:28.100
Clayton?

17:28.500 --> 17:32.967
-Blanche. How did you find me here?
-You and Rose were here last night.

17:33.033 --> 17:34.834
-May I join you?
-Of course.

17:40.700 --> 17:43.000
You know what that popcorn
reminds me of?

17:43.066 --> 17:45.867
Rex's drive-in at the lake.

17:46.734 --> 17:50.633
Remember the night my date and I
parked next to you and your date?

17:51.433 --> 17:55.667
Pretty soon it was a contest
who could fog up whose car the fastest.

17:56.667 --> 17:58.033
You won.

17:58.600 --> 18:01.667
You weren't doing too badly,
considering you were in a convertible.

18:05.934 --> 18:10.567
Clay, I've been thinking a lot
about what you told me today.

18:10.633 --> 18:15.834
And I've been thinking about that boy
out at Rex's drive-in.

18:15.900 --> 18:20.367
Honey, the two pictures don't go together.
Something's wrong with one of them.

18:20.433 --> 18:22.533
But it's not the one you're hoping,
Blanche.

18:23.066 --> 18:25.800
The heater fogged up
my windows that night.

18:27.100 --> 18:31.166
-What can I bring you, sweetheart?
-Don't talk to him like that.

18:31.233 --> 18:32.500
Get out of here.

18:39.100 --> 18:41.266
I think he was talking to you.

18:42.433 --> 18:43.500
Oh.

18:45.800 --> 18:48.667
I'm having trouble putting this
all together.

18:48.734 --> 18:52.367
I feel like I don't know you anymore.

18:52.433 --> 18:57.533
-I'm the same person.
-No. You used to be just like me.

18:57.600 --> 19:00.100
-What? Great looking?
-Yes.

19:00.166 --> 19:01.633
-Charming?
-Yes.

19:01.700 --> 19:03.133
Irresistible to men?

19:07.066 --> 19:09.133
My God, Clayton, you are me.

19:11.066 --> 19:15.900
-But I still just can't--
-Blanche, I spent a long time

19:15.967 --> 19:17.300
lying to myself.

19:18.066 --> 19:19.867
It felt a lot better when I stopped.

19:20.633 --> 19:22.800
It feels better being honest with you,
too.

19:23.867 --> 19:27.767
I'd hate to think that this will keep us
from being friends.

19:29.400 --> 19:32.033
Well, honey, of course it isn't.

19:32.533 --> 19:37.300
I'll get used to this. I will.
Why, look at me already.

19:37.367 --> 19:41.900
I'm practically comfortable
seeing you here in a gay bar.

19:41.967 --> 19:43.900
This isn't a gay bar.

19:43.967 --> 19:47.266
Now we said we'd be honest
with each other.

19:47.900 --> 19:50.400
I can do my part.

19:52.233 --> 19:54.300
You all, over at the bar,

19:55.166 --> 19:59.900
I want to say that I'd be proud
to have any one of you date my brother.

20:07.867 --> 20:09.667
I'd rather date you, lady.

20:12.133 --> 20:16.100
Sweet Jesus, I've done the impossible.
I converted one.

20:16.934 --> 20:23.567
(mellow music playing)

20:25.800 --> 20:29.000
We're going to celebrate
Clayton's last night here.

20:29.066 --> 20:30.467
Oh, terrific.

20:30.533 --> 20:34.033
Let's go to José's.
We always celebrate there.

20:34.100 --> 20:35.433
The food is great.

20:35.500 --> 20:39.467
And the waiters wear
skintight bullfighter's pants.

20:39.533 --> 20:40.667
Really?

20:44.166 --> 20:45.834
Let's go to Emilio's.

20:48.633 --> 20:52.500
-T-minus 10 seconds, Dorothy.
-Ma, will you give it up?

20:52.567 --> 20:56.533
You are not dying.
There won't be a doorbell.

20:56.600 --> 21:00.133
There won't be a pop.
There won't be anything.

21:00.200 --> 21:02.600
You see? 10 seconds.
Nothing happened.

21:02.667 --> 21:04.433
-(doorbell rings)
-Oh, God.

21:07.367 --> 21:08.667
Ma, stop.

21:09.133 --> 21:12.767
-Ooh, suddenly somebody believes me.
-Did I hear the bell?

21:12.834 --> 21:16.300
Rose, look out the peephole
and see who's at the door.

21:16.367 --> 21:17.867
Sure, Dorothy.

21:19.500 --> 21:23.400
-All I can see is a fedora.
-Oh, my God.

21:25.133 --> 21:28.033
-Who's at the door?
-It's me, Blanche.

21:33.667 --> 21:35.967
The other side.

21:36.033 --> 21:37.767
-Move, Rose.
-Ma, don't.

21:37.834 --> 21:39.400
-I have to, Dorothy.
-Ma!

21:42.000 --> 21:43.800
Mildred, what are you doing here?

21:43.867 --> 21:46.633
When do I always wear
my lucky bowling hat?

21:46.700 --> 21:48.467
We're bowling tonight?

21:48.533 --> 21:52.734
Didn't you get my message the other night?
No one answered the door.

21:52.800 --> 21:57.033
I figured you were napping, so I yelled
outside your window, we had room.

21:58.900 --> 22:00.200
Wait...

22:00.600 --> 22:02.166
wait a minute.

22:02.233 --> 22:05.834
Were your exact words,
"Sophia, you can come now.

22:05.900 --> 22:07.333
We have room now."

22:07.967 --> 22:10.900
-Were you wearing that hat at the time?
-Yes.

22:11.967 --> 22:14.567
<i>Hasta luego,</i> Dorothy. I'm going bowling.

22:21.734 --> 22:23.800
Well, let's go to dinner, ladies.

22:25.900 --> 22:27.000
Have fun.

22:36.066 --> 22:37.200
Rose, honey...

22:38.033 --> 22:40.066
there's something I have to say to you.

22:41.333 --> 22:42.667
It's just two little words,

22:42.734 --> 22:46.333
but they are the hardest
two little words for me to say.

22:46.734 --> 22:48.033
Not tonight?

22:57.700 --> 22:58.900
No.

23:00.333 --> 23:04.467
Blanche... if you've come here
to apologize, I accept.

23:05.000 --> 23:06.133
Just like that?

23:06.200 --> 23:10.767
Yes. Just the fact that you thought
of those words is plenty,

23:10.834 --> 23:14.166
considering what a selfish,
conceited person you are.

23:16.633 --> 23:19.867
But I had a whole speech planned, Rose.

23:19.934 --> 23:22.367
About how nice you were to my brother,

23:22.433 --> 23:25.867
and how proud I am to have such a sweet
person as my friend.

23:25.934 --> 23:27.967
-Now I can't say it.
-Sure you can.

23:28.033 --> 23:32.033
-You just ruined it.
-Oh, I'm so sorry.

23:32.800 --> 23:35.367
Oh, I forgive you, Rose.

23:43.900 --> 23:49.400
(theme music playing)
