WEBVTT

00:01.640 --> 00:03.640
Previously on "The Expanse"...

00:04.860 --> 00:06.369
All the ships in this space

00:06.370 --> 00:08.589
suddenly decelerated at the same moment

00:08.917 --> 00:11.584
and now we're all being
pulled toward the sphere

00:11.586 --> 00:13.753
- at the center.
- All the ships?

00:13.755 --> 00:15.722
Clarisa Mao.

00:15.724 --> 00:17.422
<i>Melba...</i>

00:17.424 --> 00:20.759
she's trying to kill James Holden.

00:24.557 --> 00:27.124
Holden! Tell me where he is!

00:29.227 --> 00:32.561
The machine got me by the leg.

00:32.564 --> 00:35.098
Our situation here gonna be multiplied

00:35.100 --> 00:36.566
100 fold through the ship.

00:36.568 --> 00:39.401
Cannot afford for lose us both.

00:41.638 --> 00:45.073
Supplies won't matter much
without gravity to heal.

00:45.075 --> 00:47.075
No way for us to make thrust now.

00:47.077 --> 00:49.777
Then we spin the drum.

00:49.779 --> 00:51.512
I have a message for all the ships

00:51.514 --> 00:53.147
in this infernal place.

00:53.149 --> 00:56.317
The Behemoth can create spin gravity.

00:56.319 --> 00:59.452
Bring your wounded here
so that they may heal.

01:04.492 --> 01:05.692
Holden?

01:05.694 --> 01:07.761
I saw something. A vision.

01:07.763 --> 01:09.295
A vision of what?

01:09.297 --> 01:11.497
The end of everything.

01:13.000 --> 01:19.074

Synced & corrected by -robtor-
www.addic7ed.com

02:57.928 --> 02:59.795
It's not gonna work.

02:59.797 --> 03:01.296
You're being pumped full of blockers.

03:01.298 --> 03:02.898
Why are you here?

03:02.900 --> 03:05.833
You were right next
to Tilly when the slowdown hit.

03:05.835 --> 03:07.268
You could have saved her.

03:07.270 --> 03:09.303
This isn't your business.

03:09.305 --> 03:11.205
How can you live with that?

03:11.207 --> 03:13.574
I've killed better people
than Tilly Fagan.

03:20.549 --> 03:22.834
I shouldn't have done that.

03:23.785 --> 03:26.004
I bet it was all her.

03:26.420 --> 03:27.953
The "Seung Un,"

03:27.955 --> 03:30.956
the fake broadcast, all of it.

03:30.958 --> 03:33.325
She tried to kill us.

03:33.327 --> 03:35.427
I don't give a shit about you.

03:35.429 --> 03:37.562
It was about Holden?

03:37.564 --> 03:39.931
Revenge for her father.

03:39.933 --> 03:42.901
I've known people like her.

03:42.903 --> 03:44.836
Keeping her around is not gonna work.

03:44.838 --> 03:46.404
Take her to the "Thomas Prince".

03:46.406 --> 03:48.472
They can lock her up.

03:48.474 --> 03:51.742
I'm not gonna take her to a UN ship.

03:51.744 --> 03:54.745
And you definitely can't
handle her alone.

03:56.582 --> 03:58.781
It'd be easier if I put her down.

03:58.783 --> 04:01.684
No! No.

04:01.686 --> 04:04.830
You're not gonna,
you're not gonna shoot her,

04:05.356 --> 04:08.523
Well, what if I override
the auto-doc to do an overdose?

04:08.525 --> 04:10.793
- It'll be painless.
- No.

04:11.695 --> 04:13.963
We're not going to kill her.

04:15.381 --> 04:18.366
This one won't be grateful
for your mercy.

04:18.368 --> 04:20.677
Well, it's not about her.

04:21.771 --> 04:23.430
It's about us.

04:25.942 --> 04:28.409
I'm still seeing red across the board.

04:28.411 --> 04:30.610
I know. Just give me a damn second...

04:32.614 --> 04:35.815
Ooh, that seems to have done
something at least.

04:35.817 --> 04:37.150
Antennae's up.

04:37.152 --> 04:39.285
Don't get too happy.

04:39.287 --> 04:40.352
We still can't transmit.

04:40.354 --> 04:41.920
Transponder signal's being received.

04:41.922 --> 04:45.290
Least we now know
where all the other ships are.

04:45.292 --> 04:46.992
What about Holden?

04:46.994 --> 04:48.427
Our scopes were locked on to that station

04:48.429 --> 04:50.121
when this whole thing went down.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.796
I think the Roci
might have seen something.

04:51.798 --> 04:53.248
Okay.

04:56.302 --> 04:57.568
Yeah...

04:57.570 --> 05:00.637
I don't think Holden left on his own.

05:00.639 --> 05:02.882
Martian skiff did though.

05:05.377 --> 05:06.690
They must have been at rest when

05:06.692 --> 05:07.948
the slowdown happened.

05:07.950 --> 05:09.479
Or at least not going any faster

05:09.481 --> 05:10.480
than I can throw a wrench.

05:10.482 --> 05:13.349
Maybe they took Holden with them.

05:14.885 --> 05:17.820
Gotcha. It's docked at the Behemoth.

05:17.822 --> 05:19.221
If Holden is on that skiff

05:19.223 --> 05:20.923
he might be with your old friends now.

05:26.596 --> 05:28.696
<i>To any ships in need.</i>

05:28.698 --> 05:31.399
<i>Your injured are welcome on the Behemoth.</i>

05:31.401 --> 05:34.668
<i>We have gravity and Med-Techs to help.</i>

05:34.670 --> 05:36.670
<i>We also welcome your crew.</i>

05:36.672 --> 05:38.739
<i>Especially medical professional.</i>

05:38.741 --> 05:40.140
<i>Any spare medical supplies
and food are also greatly...</i>

05:40.142 --> 05:42.942
Hey, I thought Drummer
was running that ship.

05:42.944 --> 05:44.443
She was.

05:44.445 --> 05:47.513
<i>To fleet relief efforts
and it will be used</i>

05:47.515 --> 05:49.849
<i>to broadcast any additional information</i>

05:49.851 --> 05:52.551
<i>as it becomes available.</i>

05:52.553 --> 05:55.453
If we can't send a message
then I need to go over there.

05:55.455 --> 05:56.724
See what's happened.

05:56.726 --> 05:59.290
- See if we can find Holden.
- All right.

05:59.292 --> 06:00.825
We'll use our vac suits for the trip.

06:00.827 --> 06:02.560
I'll take Amos and the priest.

06:02.562 --> 06:03.927
Pastor.

06:03.929 --> 06:05.480
Whatever.

06:06.632 --> 06:07.664
Naomi, wait.

06:07.666 --> 06:09.033
You hold the fort till we get back.

06:09.035 --> 06:10.861
Yeah, no.

06:11.570 --> 06:13.437
That ain't gonna work.

06:13.439 --> 06:16.939
- I have to go.
- So do I.

06:16.941 --> 06:19.609
Hey. I just got my family back.

06:20.912 --> 06:22.712
Whole team then.

06:22.714 --> 06:24.679
Whole team.

06:40.129 --> 06:44.065
I'm Captain Chandra Lucas
of the MCRN "Askia."

06:44.067 --> 06:46.933
I'm coordinating operations
inside the Ring space

06:46.935 --> 06:48.468
for the Martian survivors.

06:48.470 --> 06:50.470
We're not docked
with the "Xuesen" anymore.

06:50.472 --> 06:52.105
And you're new.

06:52.107 --> 06:54.908
I'm afraid your situation has changed.

06:54.910 --> 06:57.009
And probably not for the better.

06:57.011 --> 06:59.511
I already said everything
to the other interrogator

06:59.513 --> 07:01.413
and like I told him,

07:01.415 --> 07:02.915
I want to know where my friends are.

07:02.917 --> 07:05.451
A lot of people have died.

07:05.453 --> 07:07.919
We need to know
what happened on that station.

07:07.921 --> 07:09.921
I'm not saying another goddamn word

07:09.923 --> 07:12.090
until I know my crew is okay.

07:23.035 --> 07:24.768
James Holden.

07:24.770 --> 07:27.055
In the flesh.

07:28.005 --> 07:30.106
Ah, I am Klaes Ashford.

07:30.108 --> 07:32.184
I've heard of you.

07:32.710 --> 07:34.977
You're one of Anderson Dawes' scavengers.

07:34.979 --> 07:37.113
Ah, let's try to be civil at least.

07:37.115 --> 07:39.065
If we can.

07:39.883 --> 07:43.694
Tell me what happened on that station?

07:44.054 --> 07:46.855
So we're docked with the Behemoth.

07:48.191 --> 07:50.057
I want to talk to Naomi Nagata.

07:50.059 --> 07:52.493
- Not just yet.
- When I find out

07:52.495 --> 07:54.995
what happened to my crew, I'll talk.

07:54.997 --> 07:58.499
Bargaining is how
civilizations are built.

07:58.501 --> 08:01.601
So you tell me everything I want to know

08:01.603 --> 08:05.071
then I put you in touch
with your crew. Fair?

08:05.073 --> 08:07.006
I already told everything
to the Martians.

08:07.008 --> 08:08.441
It didn't buy me anything.

08:08.443 --> 08:11.810
Well, there's inflexibility

08:11.812 --> 08:14.913
to the military mind
which I do not share.

08:14.915 --> 08:16.915
It'll all sound insane.

08:16.917 --> 08:20.151
I am not here to judge you.

08:27.894 --> 08:31.995
Josephus Miller.
The detective from Ceres.

08:31.997 --> 08:34.597
- He who died on Eros?
- He came to me.

08:34.599 --> 08:36.566
Told me to go down to the Station.

08:36.568 --> 08:38.902
What? A dead man came to you

08:38.904 --> 08:41.870
and told you to go on?
What, you hear voices?

08:43.674 --> 08:46.008
What? You actually see this man?

08:46.010 --> 08:48.143
Do you want to hear this story or not?

08:48.145 --> 08:52.013
My apologies. Please continue.

08:52.015 --> 08:54.633
Miller took me into the Station.

08:55.685 --> 08:59.020
- Showed me things.
- What sorts of things?

08:59.022 --> 09:00.764
Images.

09:01.857 --> 09:05.025
- It's hard to put into words.
- Please try.

09:07.763 --> 09:11.198
It was like seeing a whole civilization

09:11.200 --> 09:13.532
all at once.

09:13.534 --> 09:15.901
Billions of them.

09:15.903 --> 09:18.704
Strange, bright minds.

09:18.706 --> 09:20.206
Not human.

09:20.208 --> 09:22.541
Like the ones who sent the protomolecule?

09:22.543 --> 09:24.042
The ones who created it.

09:24.044 --> 09:25.877
They made the Station.

09:25.879 --> 09:27.663
This space.

09:28.281 --> 09:31.649
Why would your dead friend show you this?

09:31.651 --> 09:34.885
We've had it all wrong
about the protomolecule.

09:34.887 --> 09:36.887
It's not a weapon.

09:36.889 --> 09:38.822
It wasn't sent to kill us.

09:38.824 --> 09:40.390
It was just trying to build a road.

09:40.392 --> 09:44.060
Where every single person
on Eros died for that road.

09:44.062 --> 09:46.896
It doesn't care about us

09:46.898 --> 09:48.531
anymore than we care

09:48.533 --> 09:51.644
about anthills we pave over.

09:52.237 --> 09:54.569
And now that it's finished
building the Ring.

09:54.571 --> 09:55.904
It's trying to report in.

09:55.906 --> 09:59.009
Re... report what? To... to whom?

09:59.011 --> 10:00.269
It doesn't matter.

10:00.271 --> 10:03.645
Everyone it could talk to is gone.

10:03.647 --> 10:05.145
I don't understand.

10:05.147 --> 10:07.314
Something killed them.

10:07.316 --> 10:09.783
It tried to stop it.

10:09.785 --> 10:11.318
Burned whole solar systems

10:11.320 --> 10:13.787
like they were cauterizing a wound.

10:13.789 --> 10:16.589
Only it didn't work.

10:16.591 --> 10:19.626
We are in a graveyard.

10:19.628 --> 10:22.929
We need to get out of this place

10:22.931 --> 10:25.383
and never come back.

10:27.001 --> 10:29.968
That man is seeing ghosts. He's insane.

10:29.970 --> 10:31.837
Captain Lucas.

10:31.839 --> 10:33.605
I'd like to restate my objection

10:33.607 --> 10:35.607
to letting the OPA interrogate
our prisoner.

10:35.609 --> 10:37.208
Your objection was noted,

10:37.210 --> 10:39.143
but our wounded need this ship.

10:39.145 --> 10:40.845
Cooperation is how we survive.

10:40.847 --> 10:42.947
Holden's not insane.

10:42.949 --> 10:44.615
When we were down there on that station

10:44.617 --> 10:46.983
it opened the door and protected him.

10:46.985 --> 10:48.985
Whatever this place is
I think he's somehow

10:48.987 --> 10:51.121
- in contact with it.
- Will he help us escape?

10:51.123 --> 10:53.056
I believe he would if he could.

10:53.058 --> 10:54.691
But this thing has its own agenda

10:54.693 --> 10:55.759
and it's not on our side.

10:55.761 --> 10:57.230
I don't think it's safe to assume

10:57.232 --> 10:58.994
that Holden is either.

10:58.996 --> 11:01.063
So my people will secure a place

11:01.065 --> 11:03.332
where he will be locked up
and under constant guard.

11:03.334 --> 11:05.634
Fine. Permission for this team

11:05.636 --> 11:07.669
to remain aboard, sir.
They'll be useful here.

11:07.671 --> 11:11.172
All are welcome.
But your weapons are not.

11:11.174 --> 11:12.407
I'm not giving you my armor.

11:12.409 --> 11:14.809
Those are the rules on this ship.

11:14.811 --> 11:18.345
You will abide by them
or you are free to leave.

11:20.149 --> 11:21.948
In this messed up alien place,

11:21.950 --> 11:23.984
we're all on the same side.

11:23.986 --> 11:25.686
Stand down.

11:29.957 --> 11:33.159
Harari, put their gear in storage.

11:33.161 --> 11:35.661
It will be safe and secure.

11:35.663 --> 11:37.830
Yes sir.

11:37.832 --> 11:40.031
Nice suit.

12:03.722 --> 12:05.254
You need to be in a medical coma.

12:05.256 --> 12:07.924
It'll help the healing process.

12:07.926 --> 12:12.194
The one way I can be even less useful.

12:12.196 --> 12:13.762
I'm fine.

12:13.764 --> 12:16.198
You are not fine.

12:16.200 --> 12:19.368
And if you keep moving
you could do permanent damage.

12:19.370 --> 12:22.203
Regrowing a spinal cord
is a delicate procedure

12:22.205 --> 12:24.782
even under the best circumstances.

12:25.875 --> 12:28.042
My people are dying.

12:28.044 --> 12:30.378
And I'm supposed to lay here
and do nothing?

12:30.380 --> 12:33.279
Yes, exactly that
if you ever want to get better.

12:33.281 --> 12:35.048
Get out.

12:35.050 --> 12:37.784
- Captain, I can't...
- Get out!

13:54.122 --> 13:57.289
<i>Please make your way to any
of the following sectors...</i>

13:57.291 --> 13:59.524
Commander Kunis, can I
have a moment, sir, please?

13:59.526 --> 14:01.159
I heard you were going to the Behemoth.

14:01.161 --> 14:02.828
- That's right.
- I'd like to go with you.

14:02.830 --> 14:04.129
You're not critically injured

14:04.131 --> 14:05.230
and you're not medical personnel.

14:05.232 --> 14:07.798
- There's no need.
- The need is we're trapped,

14:07.800 --> 14:10.301
we're all going to die here,
and you're treating symptoms.

14:10.303 --> 14:11.795
Sir...

14:13.039 --> 14:15.139
I have an idea
to get us out of this mess.

14:15.141 --> 14:17.407
The Behemoth was designed
as a generation ship.

14:17.409 --> 14:20.009
It needed the capability
to send tight-beam messages

14:20.011 --> 14:21.945
- over 100 light-years or more.
- What does that have to do...

14:21.947 --> 14:24.948
It has an extraordinarily
powerful communications laser

14:24.950 --> 14:26.282
which might be able to punch through

14:26.284 --> 14:28.350
the interference at the Ring Gate.

14:28.352 --> 14:30.052
So we could send out a call for help?

14:30.054 --> 14:32.154
This isn't magic, it's physics.

14:32.156 --> 14:34.056
It's worth a try.

14:34.058 --> 14:36.558
I'll speak to the captain
of the Behemoth.

14:40.563 --> 14:43.064
The MCRN ships are
sending medical supplies

14:43.066 --> 14:44.265
as fast as they can,

14:44.267 --> 14:46.033
but we're as beat up as you are.

14:46.035 --> 14:48.335
Coordinating with the UN is slower.

14:48.337 --> 14:50.337
Their officer corps was hit hard.

14:50.339 --> 14:53.173
Yeah, well, everything
you're doing is appreciated.

14:53.175 --> 14:55.008
Thank you, Captain.

14:55.010 --> 14:57.177
- Captain.
- What, Grigori?

14:57.179 --> 14:58.844
A lot of our medic, they dead.

14:58.846 --> 15:01.247
More than half we have left are hurt.

15:01.249 --> 15:03.449
We got 100 and 100 who need help.

15:03.451 --> 15:05.017
More than we ever expect.

15:05.019 --> 15:07.019
I'm aware of the situation.

15:07.021 --> 15:08.853
Belter got to work extra hard now

15:08.855 --> 15:10.088
for keep Inners alive.

15:10.090 --> 15:12.357
Do you think they do same for us?

15:12.359 --> 15:14.058
We're not turning anyone away.

15:14.060 --> 15:17.595
We run out of synthetic blood
four hour ago.

15:18.932 --> 15:22.132
Finally, some useful information.

15:27.373 --> 15:30.072
This is your captain.

15:30.074 --> 15:33.309
All second shift personnel

15:33.311 --> 15:37.213
report to medical units
for mandatory blood donation.

15:37.215 --> 15:38.958
And do it now.

15:40.117 --> 15:41.383
We go.

15:41.385 --> 15:42.884
You not have to do it.

15:42.886 --> 15:44.920
I bleed as well as anyone.

15:46.557 --> 15:48.223
Doesn't seem right.

15:48.225 --> 15:51.292
So many dead or messed up
but not this guy.

15:51.294 --> 15:54.361
Or you. Or me.

15:55.998 --> 15:59.166
Level Three, section 12, corridor 50.

16:11.845 --> 16:13.745
- How many died.
- What, keeping count?

16:13.747 --> 16:16.615
- Don't talk to the prisoner.
- You protecting him, Gunny?

16:16.617 --> 16:17.983
- I didn't...
- You shut up too.

16:17.985 --> 16:21.353
We're taking him to the brig as ordered.

16:21.355 --> 16:23.831
Now everyone just shut the frig up.

16:24.424 --> 16:27.158
<i>Dock four sealed now.</i>

16:27.160 --> 16:30.094
<i>Dock four is sealed now.</i>

16:37.135 --> 16:38.435
Is all you brought?

16:38.437 --> 16:41.264
Yeah, that's all we had, kid.

16:42.140 --> 16:44.006
Who the dark hair with the bad look?

16:44.008 --> 16:46.642
You need to lock her up.
She's killed a lot of people.

16:46.644 --> 16:48.677
We put a chemical restraint on her.

16:48.679 --> 16:50.980
- She can't take it off.
- Yeah, yeah, we on it.

16:50.982 --> 16:53.514
Is Holden on this ship?

16:55.285 --> 16:57.485
Listen, little shit.

16:57.487 --> 16:59.954
I want to talk to Drummer.

16:59.956 --> 17:02.123
Captain Ashford boss man now.

17:02.125 --> 17:04.290
We hold on your weapon when you on board.

17:04.292 --> 17:05.692
Well, that's not going to happen.

17:05.694 --> 17:07.227
- It's the rule.
- So?

17:07.229 --> 17:10.196
Amos. Please.

17:10.199 --> 17:12.965
- No.
- Please.

17:12.968 --> 17:14.300
I know them.

17:18.239 --> 17:22.008
Okay. All this gear to the triage units.

17:22.010 --> 17:23.476
You can go too.

17:23.478 --> 17:25.310
See the doctors, help them out.

17:25.311 --> 17:26.978
We're not going anywhere

17:26.980 --> 17:29.347
until you tell me
what happened to Drummer.

17:29.349 --> 17:32.550
No, you coming with me. You deserter.

17:32.552 --> 17:34.252
You under arrest.

17:34.254 --> 17:35.486
Okay, I'm gonna need that gun back.

17:35.488 --> 17:37.655
It's all right.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.623
I was expecting this.

17:39.625 --> 17:41.425
I will get us some answers.

17:47.699 --> 17:50.299
This way.

18:32.006 --> 18:33.605
Nagata.

18:33.607 --> 18:36.208
Your lapdog told me I was under arrest.

18:36.210 --> 18:39.043
Yeah, well, Harari correctly judged

18:39.045 --> 18:40.611
that I might want a word with you

18:40.613 --> 18:41.746
if you came back.

18:41.748 --> 18:43.715
What happened to Drummer.

18:43.717 --> 18:45.668
She was injured.

18:46.286 --> 18:48.962
And she's recovering from surgery.

18:49.288 --> 18:51.288
She saved my life.

18:51.290 --> 18:52.723
And I saved hers.

18:55.227 --> 18:57.327
You were expecting mutiny.

18:57.329 --> 18:59.328
Where's Holden?

18:59.330 --> 19:01.063
Did the Martians bring him here?

19:01.065 --> 19:03.232
Yeah, they did, but he's no condition

19:03.234 --> 19:05.067
to entertain visitors.

19:05.069 --> 19:07.403
I believe whatever happened
on that station

19:07.405 --> 19:09.672
damaged his mind,
but we're caring for him.

19:09.674 --> 19:11.732
I want to see him.

19:12.075 --> 19:15.343
Our problems with the grid
have persisted.

19:15.345 --> 19:17.512
One of these times it's going to go down

19:17.514 --> 19:19.748
and it won't come back up again.

19:19.750 --> 19:21.749
I didn't come here to fix your ship.

19:21.751 --> 19:24.118
And whenever that happens

19:24.120 --> 19:26.653
everyone on this ship
will asphyxiate in the dark.

19:26.655 --> 19:28.756
And that includes your crew.

19:28.758 --> 19:31.591
James Holden and Drummer.

19:31.593 --> 19:33.586
Well, all of us.

19:35.797 --> 19:39.565
I'll come up with a plan
to stabilize the grid

19:39.567 --> 19:41.767
and put together teams
to implement the repairs.

19:41.769 --> 19:43.428
Good.

19:44.345 --> 19:47.139
Then, I'm going to see my friends.

19:48.194 --> 19:50.242
Aye, you might as well get on with it.

20:11.363 --> 20:14.496
Oi. One time you out line.

20:14.498 --> 20:17.699
Two in the head, sasa ke?

20:35.484 --> 20:37.484
Hey.

20:37.486 --> 20:41.388
I'm Jim. What are you in for?

20:52.636 --> 20:54.938
<i>We tune comm laser to visible range.</i>

20:54.940 --> 20:57.368
<i>When your flash it, send Belter tap code.</i>

20:57.393 --> 20:58.525
Good idea.

20:58.527 --> 21:00.682
<i>Yeah, we get those sometime, Earther.</i>

21:00.684 --> 21:03.563
<i>Charge complete.</i>

21:03.565 --> 21:06.766
<i>Comm laser firing... now.</i>

21:16.977 --> 21:18.610
<i>Beam not strong enough.</i>

21:18.612 --> 21:20.711
<i>Not getting through the distortion.</i>

21:20.713 --> 21:23.614
<i>All it do is heat up Ring
a couple of degree.</i>

21:27.653 --> 21:29.553
Here.

21:36.394 --> 21:37.927
Damn.

21:37.929 --> 21:40.597
You ever think you'd see
anything like this?

21:40.599 --> 21:42.397
Inners and Belters, side by side,

21:42.399 --> 21:44.066
helping each other.

21:44.068 --> 21:46.735
Peace in our time?

21:46.737 --> 21:49.571
All it took was everybody about to die.

21:49.573 --> 21:51.973
Yeah...

21:57.113 --> 21:58.913
<i>This is Monica Stuart reporting from</i>

21:58.915 --> 22:00.915
<i>the Intership Relief Channel.</i>

22:00.917 --> 22:03.883
<i>A new shipment...</i> See, they made it.

22:03.885 --> 22:05.352
<i>Including much needed electrical parts,</i>

22:05.354 --> 22:08.755
<i>has just been received
from the UNN "Thomas Prince."</i>

22:08.757 --> 22:10.824
<i>Captain Ashford asks that anyone</i>

22:10.826 --> 22:12.758
<i>with engineering experience
contact his staff...</i>

22:12.760 --> 22:14.693
Blah, blah, blah.

22:14.695 --> 22:16.795
What's wrong with you?
That's a good idea.

22:16.797 --> 22:20.099
<i>The ship. The medical group reports...</i>

22:20.101 --> 22:21.433
I've got to get me something to eat.

22:21.435 --> 22:24.936
You coming? I'll catch up.

22:32.612 --> 22:35.946
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

22:35.948 --> 22:37.781
Good.

22:37.783 --> 22:39.616
Okay.

22:39.618 --> 22:42.418
- Hey.
- Are you a doctor?

22:42.955 --> 22:44.787
I was a nurse.

22:44.789 --> 22:45.921
Before I was a minister.

22:45.923 --> 22:48.424
I run a clinic in St. Petersburg

22:48.426 --> 22:49.525
for the undocumented.

22:49.527 --> 22:52.061
Those are people who aren't on Basic.

22:52.063 --> 22:54.130
Yeah, I know people like that.

22:54.132 --> 22:55.630
Yeah.

22:55.632 --> 22:57.348
Why do you do it?

22:57.734 --> 23:00.802
Uh, because it needs to be done.

23:00.804 --> 23:03.004
I think that's what most of my life is.

23:03.006 --> 23:07.148
Seeing what needs to be done
and trying to do it.

23:07.777 --> 23:09.677
Mine too.

23:09.679 --> 23:11.545
Yeah.

23:32.700 --> 23:36.234
What, you never saw anyone
who got hurt before?

23:36.236 --> 23:39.136
They said you were injured,
but I didn't...

23:42.108 --> 23:44.141
How are you?

23:45.511 --> 23:47.610
Back aches pretty bad
right down to the spot

23:47.612 --> 23:50.814
where I can't feel anything at all.

23:50.816 --> 23:54.017
- I'm so sorry...
- Don't.

24:02.860 --> 24:05.285
Ashford knows you're back?

24:06.964 --> 24:08.596
I've spent the last several hours

24:08.598 --> 24:11.199
making repairs to the ship's power grid.

24:11.201 --> 24:14.168
I bet he love putting you back to work.

24:15.038 --> 24:17.045
I sort of need a favor.

24:17.607 --> 24:20.107
This is the wrong kind
of power pack assembly.

24:22.678 --> 24:24.811
Favor?

24:24.813 --> 24:26.554
Holden is here.

24:27.716 --> 24:28.948
Whatever happened to him on that station,

24:28.950 --> 24:32.893
it has to be connected
with everything happening now.

24:33.588 --> 24:36.122
If I could just talk with him, then...

24:36.124 --> 24:38.356
maybe he can help.

24:42.562 --> 24:45.070
And I thought you come to check on me.

24:47.100 --> 24:49.933
Of course I did.

24:54.573 --> 24:56.789
I can make this work.

24:59.078 --> 25:01.077
I'm glad you're back.

25:09.754 --> 25:11.386
That did it.

25:11.388 --> 25:13.655
Thank you.

25:15.225 --> 25:18.827
You think he can help get us out of this?

25:18.829 --> 25:20.896
I don't know.

25:20.898 --> 25:22.596
I hope so.

25:22.598 --> 25:27.101
Well, you help me finish this.

25:27.103 --> 25:29.937
And I'll walk you down there.

25:39.948 --> 25:41.614
I found something interesting

25:41.616 --> 25:43.949
and three other ships confirm my data.

25:43.951 --> 25:46.218
There's a pattern of decreased
virtual particle activity

25:46.220 --> 25:47.986
between us and that station.

25:47.988 --> 25:50.622
I don't know what that means.

25:50.624 --> 25:52.291
- On a quantum level it means...
- Oh, please,

25:52.293 --> 25:54.759
just tell me what you want from me.

25:54.761 --> 25:57.295
I want to send a skiff
between us and the Station

25:57.297 --> 25:59.964
with a nuclear warhead
or overloaded reactor.

25:59.966 --> 26:02.934
<i>I want to create a very high
energy radioactive burst.</i>

26:02.936 --> 26:05.302
The last time something
blew up near the Station,

26:05.304 --> 26:07.704
it disassembled a Martian Marine.

26:07.706 --> 26:10.471
It would seem like
a dangerous thing to do.

26:10.473 --> 26:11.677
<i>The field that's trapping us here</i>

26:11.679 --> 26:12.851
<i>will contain the explosion.</i>

26:12.853 --> 26:14.216
<i>There's no danger to us or the Station</i>

26:14.218 --> 26:16.145
<i>but the high energy photons it generates,</i>

26:16.147 --> 26:18.214
I think it might interfere
with what's stopping us.

26:18.216 --> 26:20.149
Would that help to free us?

26:20.151 --> 26:21.350
<i>Honestly, I don't know.</i>

26:21.352 --> 26:22.960
The data we'd get would tell us more

26:22.962 --> 26:24.986
about the field that's trapping us here.

26:24.988 --> 26:26.515
At least it's a start.

26:26.517 --> 26:28.356
We have a limited number of skiffs...

26:28.358 --> 26:30.725
That's why I'm asking you,
Captain Ashford.

26:30.727 --> 26:32.861
<i>There must be something
on the Behemoth we can use.</i>

26:32.863 --> 26:34.928
Something damaged.
It wouldn't have to move far.

26:34.930 --> 26:37.731
Doctor, you are out of line.

26:37.733 --> 26:40.167
Hey, we need answers. Right?

26:40.169 --> 26:43.386
And this at least seems
like a plan to find some.

26:44.840 --> 26:47.106
We'll locate something you can use.

26:47.108 --> 26:49.208
<i>Thank you.</i>

26:50.245 --> 26:52.378
You're taking a hell of a risk.

26:52.380 --> 26:55.855
Well, I would say
the situation calls for it.

26:59.686 --> 27:00.619
Hey, it's going to be okay.

27:00.621 --> 27:03.021
Doc, this here's Samuel.

27:03.023 --> 27:06.024
He really needs some painkillers.

27:06.026 --> 27:07.858
If you find some, go ahead.

27:07.860 --> 27:09.894
I don't have any left.

27:09.896 --> 27:12.963
Find some? What do you mean? Doc?

27:12.965 --> 27:14.798
Would you tell me where to look...

27:14.800 --> 27:18.034
Hang tight, Samuel. I'll be right back.

27:27.278 --> 27:28.971
Where'd Alex go?

27:30.714 --> 27:33.715
Shit, I was going to ask him
where the galley was.

27:33.717 --> 27:35.717
I'm gonna scare up some food.
You want any?

27:35.719 --> 27:38.219
I'm gonna be here for a while.

27:38.221 --> 27:40.437
You know he's dead, right?

27:42.392 --> 27:43.940
I do.

27:45.359 --> 27:47.319
And you're still trying to help him?

27:48.130 --> 27:51.364
No. I'm just...

27:51.366 --> 27:53.800
taking a moment with him.

27:55.737 --> 27:58.405
I'll bring you some food.

28:14.854 --> 28:17.689
Did you ever think it would come to this?

28:17.691 --> 28:18.756
To what?

28:18.758 --> 28:21.758
We spend our lives
cutting Inners' throats

28:21.760 --> 28:23.093
before they cut ours

28:23.095 --> 28:26.163
and now here we are trying to save them.

28:26.165 --> 28:28.314
- Does seem odd, doesn't it?
- Yeah.

28:29.802 --> 28:32.067
Keep an eye on them all the same.

28:33.037 --> 28:36.205
I get the idea you're trying
to tell me something.

28:36.207 --> 28:39.041
Some supplies are thinner
than the inventory.

28:39.043 --> 28:41.276
Someone could be stealing.

28:44.948 --> 28:46.997
We are done here.

28:48.352 --> 28:50.285
Oi, boss man.

28:50.287 --> 28:52.886
You got to hear this story she tell me.

28:52.888 --> 28:55.856
Lieutenant Diogo Harari,

28:55.858 --> 28:57.858
- OPA.
- What I do?

28:57.860 --> 28:59.426
Who did I put in charge of security

28:59.428 --> 29:01.995
- for emergency supplies?
- Me, boss man.

29:01.997 --> 29:04.197
Yeah. Have any supplies gone missing?

29:04.199 --> 29:05.999
- I don't know.
- It's a simple question.

29:06.001 --> 29:08.067
- I don't know...
- Are there missing supplies?

29:08.069 --> 29:10.936
- I don't know!
- Then who the hell would?

29:14.375 --> 29:16.274
Beltalowda.

29:16.276 --> 29:18.610
Eyes and ears.

29:20.781 --> 29:23.514
We are trapped in the Black
and fighting for our lives.

29:23.516 --> 29:25.182
So make no mistake.

29:25.184 --> 29:26.817
Everything we do here

29:26.819 --> 29:29.153
is to buy one more chance to live.

29:29.155 --> 29:31.322
One more breath!

29:31.324 --> 29:34.224
So do your faloting job

29:34.226 --> 29:37.527
or I will space you myself.

29:45.936 --> 29:48.237
I stretched the truth.

29:48.239 --> 29:50.839
I told them I was your minister.

29:50.841 --> 29:53.442
You came to the wrong place.

29:53.444 --> 29:55.843
I don't want to talk about that.

29:55.845 --> 29:58.546
- About what?
- God.

29:59.516 --> 30:02.050
Love.

30:02.052 --> 30:03.284
Forgiveness.

30:03.286 --> 30:05.886
I don't want to talk
about any of that either.

30:11.060 --> 30:13.593
I don't actually want to talk.

30:13.595 --> 30:14.728
Really.

30:14.730 --> 30:17.596
Just wanted to be here for a minute.

30:17.598 --> 30:19.365
I thought it might help me.

30:19.367 --> 30:21.233
I don't want to help you.

30:21.235 --> 30:23.502
You didn't want to help Tilly either.

30:23.504 --> 30:25.104
It's funny, isn't it?

30:25.106 --> 30:27.972
All the people you killed and I'm hung up

30:27.974 --> 30:31.409
on the one that you just
couldn't be bothered to save.

30:32.379 --> 30:36.547
I thought if I came here
and I looked you in the eyes...

30:38.117 --> 30:40.475
Maybe I could see you as a person.

30:41.120 --> 30:43.921
- Why do you care.
- I don't.

30:43.923 --> 30:46.223
That's what's strange.

30:46.225 --> 30:49.926
I try to care about everyone.
It's exhausting.

30:49.928 --> 30:53.445
When Amos offered to kill you...

30:54.065 --> 30:56.432
I wanted to let him.

30:57.267 --> 30:58.600
Why didn't you?

30:58.602 --> 31:00.569
I keep looking for a way
to care about you.

31:00.571 --> 31:04.139
I think "her father
was a terrible person.

31:04.141 --> 31:07.008
"But a lot of people
have terrible parents.

31:07.010 --> 31:08.242
"And...

31:08.244 --> 31:11.979
"I think, well,
she's clearly a damaged...

31:11.981 --> 31:13.964
"person, but then...

31:14.884 --> 31:16.341
who isn't?"

31:17.620 --> 31:20.620
So, I'm down to

31:20.622 --> 31:22.972
"maybe she has a brain tumor?"

31:25.026 --> 31:27.268
Do you have a brain tumor?

31:29.930 --> 31:31.354
No.

31:35.136 --> 31:37.603
It wasn't mercy.

31:37.605 --> 31:39.670
Um...

31:39.672 --> 31:41.655
it was vanity.

31:42.542 --> 31:44.375
I didn't want to think of myself

31:44.377 --> 31:46.978
as someone who wanted vengeance.

31:46.980 --> 31:49.212
Are you asking for my forgiveness?

31:49.214 --> 31:51.114
No.

31:51.116 --> 31:53.483
You're a coward.

31:56.622 --> 31:59.055
You should have let him kill me.

31:59.057 --> 32:01.298
You don't get the easy way out.

32:24.346 --> 32:26.547
<i>- You're almost in position.</i>
<i>- </i> Good.

32:26.549 --> 32:29.483
Messed up skiff fly like garbage scow.

32:29.485 --> 32:32.685
- And the bomb?
<i>- Ready for remote detonation.</i>

32:32.687 --> 32:35.054
Okay, that's far enough.

32:35.056 --> 32:36.689
Do it.

33:03.014 --> 33:04.547
That...

33:04.549 --> 33:07.107
that definitely did something.

33:07.619 --> 33:10.353
We still not move.

33:10.355 --> 33:11.387
<i>But the pattern's changed.</i>

33:11.389 --> 33:15.357
The added energy
definitely had an effect.

33:15.359 --> 33:18.193
It'll take time to analyze all this.

33:18.195 --> 33:20.562
All we got in time, us.

33:20.564 --> 33:23.098
Blew up a damn nuke.

33:23.100 --> 33:25.499
Alien they not even notice.

33:56.763 --> 33:58.463
Captain.

33:58.465 --> 34:01.132
- Egan.
- Good to see you on your feet.

34:01.134 --> 34:03.301
Good to see you again, too.

34:03.303 --> 34:04.569
Open the door.

34:04.571 --> 34:06.570
Sorry, boss man, no can do.

34:06.572 --> 34:08.038
Me not suppose to leave this one alone.

34:08.040 --> 34:10.107
He won't be alone.

34:40.168 --> 34:43.670
They let me call the Roci.
No one answered.

34:43.672 --> 34:47.241
I got the boys off the ship.
Everyone's okay.

34:47.243 --> 34:49.275
They're here now.

34:49.277 --> 34:51.476
I was afraid I got you all killed.

34:53.348 --> 34:56.449
You didn't.

34:56.451 --> 34:59.351
I don't believe
what's happening is your fault.

34:59.353 --> 35:02.454
They won't tell me anything.

35:02.456 --> 35:04.690
It's obviously bad.

35:04.692 --> 35:06.858
The speed limit changed.

35:08.828 --> 35:11.162
I'm just happy you're here.

35:11.164 --> 35:14.432
I never should have left.

35:30.481 --> 35:33.031
I did come for a reason.

35:33.651 --> 35:35.718
If you're going to ask me
how to fix all this,

35:35.720 --> 35:37.486
I'm completely lost.

35:37.488 --> 35:41.389
The boys said you were talking to Miller?

35:43.226 --> 35:44.958
I saw him.

35:45.829 --> 35:48.529
As real as you right now.

35:48.531 --> 35:51.131
He warned me about the speed limit.

35:51.133 --> 35:53.166
Saved our lives when
the Behemoth fired at us.

35:53.168 --> 35:54.501
I tried to stop that.

35:54.503 --> 35:57.704
He told me to go to the Station.

35:57.706 --> 36:00.906
I saw terrible things.

36:00.908 --> 36:03.909
Saw the beings who built the Ring.

36:03.911 --> 36:05.811
What happened to them.

36:05.813 --> 36:08.347
All of it happening in my head.

36:08.349 --> 36:09.582
I couldn't shut it out.

36:09.584 --> 36:11.383
That's over now.

36:11.385 --> 36:14.352
All of it has to mean something.

36:14.354 --> 36:18.356
Otherwise all these people
have died for nothing.

36:19.359 --> 36:21.693
What is Miller telling you now?

36:21.695 --> 36:24.862
Hasn't been back
since I left the Station.

36:24.864 --> 36:26.597
I mean I haven't had a lot of time alone.

36:26.599 --> 36:28.998
- But still nothing.
- Good.

36:30.369 --> 36:32.301
You're not responsible for this.

36:32.303 --> 36:34.370
Yes, I am.

36:34.372 --> 36:36.873
It's talking to me.

36:36.875 --> 36:38.541
Not talking to anyone else.

36:38.543 --> 36:41.177
I wish it would, but it's not.

36:41.179 --> 36:42.779
I have to figure out what it wants.

36:42.780 --> 36:44.579
I'm the only one who can.

36:44.581 --> 36:46.381
This is going to destroy you.

36:46.383 --> 36:48.266
It doesn't matter.

36:48.819 --> 36:51.586
I have to fix it.

37:03.399 --> 37:05.398
It appears the detonation of the skiff

37:05.400 --> 37:06.533
changed the behavior of the Station.

37:06.535 --> 37:08.099
<i>Yeah, well, that was the point</i>

37:08.101 --> 37:09.569
<i>of the exercise, right?</i>

37:09.571 --> 37:10.975
But it didn't affect the behavior

37:10.977 --> 37:12.605
of the field holding us here.

37:12.607 --> 37:14.740
<i>The Station is
now generating magnetic pulses</i>

37:14.742 --> 37:16.408
<i>like a... like a railgun charging up,</i>

37:16.410 --> 37:18.911
<i>only on a massive scale.</i>

37:18.913 --> 37:22.281
<i>The pulses are focused
toward the Ring Gate.</i>

37:22.283 --> 37:24.349
They burned whole solar systems

37:24.351 --> 37:28.286
like they were trying
to cauterize a wound.

37:28.288 --> 37:29.954
<i>What was that?</i>

37:29.956 --> 37:33.257
Ah, nothing, just something
a madman told me once.

37:33.259 --> 37:35.525
Do we know how long this will last?

37:35.527 --> 37:38.495
The pulses are increasing
in frequency and amplitude.

37:38.497 --> 37:39.996
I estimate less than seven hours

37:39.998 --> 37:42.499
before it becomes a continuous signal.

37:42.501 --> 37:44.525
Whatever's gonna happen...

37:45.404 --> 37:48.270
it'll happen then.

37:58.448 --> 38:00.748
<i>So that's the official report.</i>

38:00.883 --> 38:03.518
<i>The skiff detonation was intentional.</i>

38:03.520 --> 38:05.887
<i>Part of some science project.</i>

38:05.889 --> 38:07.488
<i>But there is still no official comment</i>

38:07.490 --> 38:10.491
<i>on the new activity
coming from the Station.</i>

38:10.493 --> 38:14.652
<i>I have reached out to sources
at the UNN, MCRN, and OPA</i>

38:14.677 --> 38:16.010
<i>and they all say the same thing.</i>

38:16.012 --> 38:18.879
<i>Stay calm, be patient
while we analyze the data.</i>

38:18.881 --> 38:20.947
<i>But an anonymous source has told me that</i>

38:20.949 --> 38:24.050
<i>the magnetic activity coming
from the Station is increasing</i>

38:24.052 --> 38:26.853
<i>and seems to be affecting
the Ring Gate as well.</i>

38:26.855 --> 38:28.954
<i>We came into this place
thinking we understood</i>

38:28.956 --> 38:30.756
<i>the rules and then the rules changed</i>

38:30.758 --> 38:31.957
<i>and a lot of people died.</i>

38:31.959 --> 38:34.193
<i>Now the rules are changing again.</i>

38:34.195 --> 38:36.295
<i>We have been told to remain calm.</i>

38:36.297 --> 38:38.830
<i>Fine. We don't really have
any other choice.</i>

38:38.832 --> 38:40.298
<i>But there are a lot</i>

38:40.300 --> 38:42.000
<i>of frightened people in here with me</i>

38:42.002 --> 38:45.103
<i>and I hope that the answers
are coming soon.</i>

38:45.105 --> 38:46.938
<i>This is Monica Stuart on the Behemoth.</i>

38:46.940 --> 38:48.707
What do you think that means?

38:50.209 --> 38:52.253
I have no idea.

38:53.312 --> 38:55.212
We kicked the hornet's nest

38:55.214 --> 38:58.415
and now we know for sure
that there are hornets inside.

38:58.417 --> 39:01.918
Freezing all of our ships
wasn't enough proof for you?

39:01.920 --> 39:04.387
Proof that the Station
would protect itself, yes,

39:04.389 --> 39:06.155
but proof that it was a threat

39:06.157 --> 39:09.058
to the lives of everyone
who entered this space?

39:09.060 --> 39:10.978
No. But now, yes.

39:11.929 --> 39:14.896
Holden told me that on the Station

39:14.898 --> 39:18.099
he saw a vision of Rings being used

39:18.101 --> 39:21.335
to burn entire solar systems to ash.

39:21.337 --> 39:23.738
He believed that the Station did this

39:23.740 --> 39:25.616
to stop a threat.

39:26.742 --> 39:29.310
When we detonated our bomb

39:29.312 --> 39:31.277
I believe we became the threat.

39:31.279 --> 39:33.079
And not just our ships,

39:33.081 --> 39:34.527
but everyone.

39:34.529 --> 39:36.180
All humanity.

39:36.182 --> 39:38.718
On both sides of the Ring.

39:38.720 --> 39:40.853
Jesus Christ.

39:40.855 --> 39:43.121
No, I'm glad we set off the bomb.

39:43.123 --> 39:45.357
It showed us what the Station truly is,

39:45.359 --> 39:48.026
and we still have time to act.

39:48.028 --> 39:49.599
What are you proposing?

39:49.600 --> 39:51.966
One of your marines destroyed
a piece of the Station

39:51.968 --> 39:53.735
before it killed him.

39:53.737 --> 39:56.171
So we now know it can be damaged.

39:56.173 --> 39:58.396
You want to try to blow it up?

39:59.543 --> 40:01.710
We got a lot of nukes left
we could ferry down...

40:01.712 --> 40:03.744
Yeah, yeah, that's...
that's an interesting idea,

40:03.746 --> 40:06.880
but during such an attack
our solar system

40:06.882 --> 40:10.117
would still be connected
to this place through the Ring.

40:10.119 --> 40:12.019
And that is the means
by which this Station

40:12.021 --> 40:14.253
can still threaten us.

40:18.960 --> 40:21.060
That Ring is our only way home.

40:21.062 --> 40:24.419
It'd take months for a skiff
to ferry bombs up there.

40:24.932 --> 40:28.800
When you go outside you still see, right?

40:28.802 --> 40:32.537
<i>Photons still travel
at the speed of light in here.</i>

40:32.539 --> 40:34.739
<i>They are not affected by the speed limit.</i>

40:34.741 --> 40:35.973
<i>So a laser then?</i>

40:35.975 --> 40:37.308
<i>The Behemoth's comm laser</i>

40:37.310 --> 40:40.044
<i>is the most powerful ever built.</i>

40:40.046 --> 40:42.947
<i>And I propose we make it even more so</i>

40:42.949 --> 40:45.782
<i>and use it to slice through the Ring</i>

40:45.784 --> 40:47.550
and destroy it

40:47.552 --> 40:49.986
and cut the Station off from our homes.

40:49.988 --> 40:52.655
And to trap us all here forever.

40:52.657 --> 40:55.839
No one on the other side
would ever know what we did.

40:57.039 --> 40:59.039
And we will have to say to human race.

41:01.136 --> 41:03.136
Not a bad way to die.

41:32.382 --> 41:34.949
<i>You owe me.</i>

41:34.951 --> 41:36.818
<i>I did what you asked.</i>

41:38.053 --> 41:40.320
<i>I did everything you asked.</i>

41:43.225 --> 41:46.326
<i>Now I need you, Miller.</i>

41:47.395 --> 41:49.495
<i>If you're ever coming back,</i>

41:49.497 --> 41:51.931
<i>this would be a good time.</i>

41:51.933 --> 41:54.133
I still don't understand
what you see in him.

41:54.135 --> 41:56.869
<i>Come on, Miller, talk to me.</i>

41:56.871 --> 41:58.570
<i>Please.</i>

42:15.020 --> 42:16.420
Muster all the MPs on the dock,

42:16.422 --> 42:17.921
I'll be there shortly.

42:17.923 --> 42:18.921
Grigori.

42:18.923 --> 42:21.123
I need a power grid status report.

42:21.125 --> 42:22.892
And get Nagata up here, now.

42:22.894 --> 42:24.126
Yes, Captain.

42:24.128 --> 42:25.428
Gunny.

42:25.430 --> 42:27.396
- Reporting as ordered.
- With me.

42:28.499 --> 42:30.031
We're gonna need a tactical plan

42:30.033 --> 42:31.466
for command deck security
and crowd control

42:31.468 --> 42:32.567
- throughout the Behemoth.
- Has there been

42:32.569 --> 42:35.103
- a credible threat?
- Call it a contingency.

42:35.105 --> 42:36.838
Get me a list of personnel
and equipment you'll need,

42:36.840 --> 42:39.107
and be prepared to deploy
within the hour.

42:39.109 --> 42:41.208
Sir?

42:41.210 --> 42:44.044
It would help to know
what we're defending against.

42:44.046 --> 42:46.113
Can I count on you?

42:46.115 --> 42:48.182
Yes, sir.

42:53.321 --> 42:55.788
<i>It's about God damned time.</i>

42:55.790 --> 42:57.423
<i>What the hell's going on
with the station?</i>

42:57.425 --> 42:58.958
<i>Is this my fault?</i>

42:58.960 --> 43:00.392
<i>Did you get me to arm a bomb?</i>

43:01.562 --> 43:03.395
How would I know why they did that?

43:03.397 --> 43:07.032
I've been locked up since
the last time I saw you.

43:07.034 --> 43:09.901
<i>"Bunch of blade boys humping shank."</i>

43:09.903 --> 43:11.369
<i>What does that even mean?</i>

43:14.007 --> 43:16.140
Okay.

43:16.142 --> 43:18.075
That sounds bad.

43:19.912 --> 43:22.312
<i>So how do we do that?</i>

43:22.314 --> 43:24.147
<i>Uh-huh.</i>

43:24.149 --> 43:25.982
<i>Okay.</i>

43:25.984 --> 43:27.284
<i>Right.</i>

43:31.123 --> 43:32.621
<i>I know how to fix this.</i>

43:42.232 --> 43:43.431
Ashford.

43:43.433 --> 43:45.333
<i>It's Drummer.</i>

43:45.335 --> 43:46.901
Camina.

43:46.903 --> 43:48.336
It's good to hear your voice.

43:48.338 --> 43:49.904
<i>It's good to still have one.</i>

43:49.906 --> 43:51.272
I was just going to come to see you.

43:51.274 --> 43:53.507
I've been talking to Holden.

43:53.509 --> 43:55.909
<i>He says he knows how to get us out</i>

43:55.911 --> 43:57.177
<i>of this mess.</i>

43:57.179 --> 43:58.645
Ah, you're with Holden.

43:58.647 --> 44:01.114
Last time I saw, you couldn't even walk.

44:01.116 --> 44:02.649
Yes, Naomi helped with that.

44:02.651 --> 44:05.584
<i>Ah, Nagata is there as well.</i>

44:05.586 --> 44:07.353
<i>Where are you? In the Brig?</i>

44:07.355 --> 44:10.089
Drummer is still the captain of the ship.

44:10.091 --> 44:12.158
Yes.

44:12.160 --> 44:14.292
What is Holden telling you to do?

44:14.294 --> 44:16.428
He believes he can convince the station

44:16.430 --> 44:19.497
that we are not a threat.

44:19.499 --> 44:21.966
The station killed thousands of us

44:21.968 --> 44:23.935
for no reason.

44:23.937 --> 44:25.636
We are not the threat, here.

44:25.638 --> 44:28.138
<i>But maybe Holden is.</i>

44:29.208 --> 44:31.275
We should talk in person.

44:33.145 --> 44:35.445
I agree.

44:35.447 --> 44:37.447
I'll be right there.

44:42.454 --> 44:44.120
Bring them to me.

44:44.122 --> 44:47.456
And do not let anyone stop you.

44:47.458 --> 44:48.957
Ya, Bosmang.

44:52.529 --> 44:53.695
Eagan.

44:53.697 --> 44:55.996
- Give me your weapon.
- Sure, Bosmang.

44:56.966 --> 44:57.898
Ashford's coming for us.

44:57.900 --> 44:59.500
He will not let us do this.

44:59.502 --> 45:01.402
We can tie you up if you want.

45:01.404 --> 45:03.037
No one will know you helped us.

45:03.039 --> 45:04.972
Na need. Mi with you.

45:04.974 --> 45:07.173
Eros, Ganymede.

45:07.175 --> 45:09.309
Im Belta, oso.

45:13.548 --> 45:15.582
<i>The station's deciding
whether we're a threat.</i>

45:15.584 --> 45:17.483
So what happens if it decides we are?

45:17.485 --> 45:19.251
I saw it turn a Marine
who threw a grenade

45:19.253 --> 45:20.252
into red mist, I'm guessing

45:20.254 --> 45:21.186
something like that.

45:21.188 --> 45:22.602
Only, you know, all of us.

45:22.604 --> 45:24.427
<i>So, did Miller give you any idea</i>

45:24.429 --> 45:26.225
<i>how not to be red mist?</i>
If we get the station

45:26.227 --> 45:28.659
not to consider us a threat,
he can get it to stand down.

45:28.661 --> 45:30.128
So how do we stop looking like one?

45:30.130 --> 45:31.462
<i>When we overloaded
the reactor on that skiff,</i>

45:31.464 --> 45:33.135
<i>we taught the station that our ships</i>

45:33.137 --> 45:35.233
are fusion bombs. We need to shut down

45:35.235 --> 45:36.334
every reactor in the flotilla.

45:36.336 --> 45:37.919
- Oh, is that all?
<i>- Or we can wait</i>

45:37.921 --> 45:39.932
for it to decide if we're safer
as red mist.

45:39.934 --> 45:42.072
- What do you need from us?
<i>- Go find Monica Stuart</i>

45:42.074 --> 45:44.007
<i>and Cohen, and tell them
everything I'm telling you.</i>

45:44.009 --> 45:45.409
<i>They can use the Intership Relief Channel</i>

45:45.411 --> 45:46.761
<i>to get the message out.</i>

45:46.763 --> 45:48.043
<i>The moment you start to broadcast,</i>

45:48.045 --> 45:49.464
<i>Ashford will try to stop it.</i>

45:49.466 --> 45:52.114
I'm sending you directions
to a substation,

45:52.116 --> 45:53.549
where you can tap directly into
the Behemoth's

45:53.551 --> 45:55.384
transmitter array. They won't be able

45:55.386 --> 45:57.286
<i>to cut you off there.</i>
The second we tap in,

45:57.288 --> 45:58.287
they'll know exactly where we are.

45:58.289 --> 46:00.188
- There's no way to hide that.
- I know.

46:00.190 --> 46:02.290
<i>He will send people after you.</i>

46:02.292 --> 46:04.692
- We're gonna need some guns.
- I'll send you access codes

46:04.694 --> 46:06.394
to the security locker on your level.

46:06.396 --> 46:07.695
<i>Look...</i>

46:07.697 --> 46:09.158
<i>Telling a whole bunch of scared people</i>

46:09.160 --> 46:10.323
to turn the lights off, here,

46:10.325 --> 46:12.366
That... that's gonna be a tough sale.

46:12.368 --> 46:13.300
Well, you're just gonna
have to figure out

46:13.302 --> 46:14.762
how to convince them.

46:14.764 --> 46:16.020
We'll have enough trouble of our own

46:16.022 --> 46:17.671
shutting down the Behemoth.

46:17.673 --> 46:20.072
Even given the circumstances,

46:20.074 --> 46:21.867
it's nice to have you back.

46:22.644 --> 46:24.078
Good huntin', Cap.

46:24.871 --> 46:26.237
<i>You too.</i>

46:43.763 --> 46:45.262
We're gonna need you to come with us.

46:45.264 --> 46:47.131
My patients need me here.

46:47.133 --> 46:49.567
Nothing you're doing here matters.

46:49.569 --> 46:52.101
- I disagree.
- Unless we can convince

46:52.103 --> 46:53.236
a whole lot of people to do something

46:53.238 --> 46:54.771
they're not gonna want to do,

46:54.773 --> 46:56.773
everybody's going to die.

47:06.584 --> 47:08.016
<i>- Captain.</i>

47:08.018 --> 47:09.485
<i>Holden gone from da brig.</i>

47:09.487 --> 47:11.086
<i>With Drummer and Nagata.</i>

47:11.088 --> 47:12.876
<i>No one know where they go.</i>

47:12.878 --> 47:14.021
Find them!

47:14.023 --> 47:15.234
<i>Me on it, Bosmang.</i>

47:15.236 --> 47:17.258
<i>You can count on me.</i>

47:22.631 --> 47:25.465
He needs a medic!

47:25.467 --> 47:27.767
How much time did that just cost us?

47:27.769 --> 47:28.638
Too much work,

47:28.980 --> 47:30.246
not enough worker.

47:30.248 --> 47:31.518
People go too fast,

47:31.520 --> 47:33.548
make mistake, and get hurt!

47:33.550 --> 47:35.917
Then get more people
who know what they are doing

47:35.919 --> 47:37.052
- up here now.
- Bosmang,

47:37.054 --> 47:39.554
we running primary power
direct from reactor

47:39.556 --> 47:41.106
to Comm Laser.

47:42.059 --> 47:45.059
Is it really about getting signal out?

47:48.064 --> 47:49.030
No.

47:49.032 --> 47:51.299
That station killed a lot of us,

47:51.301 --> 47:53.067
and they are trying to kill more.

47:53.069 --> 47:54.601
It's time we fight back.

47:56.071 --> 47:58.271
I get more people.

48:00.289 --> 48:02.449
<i>And ever since Ashford assumed command,</i>

48:02.450 --> 48:05.494
<i>security on the Behemoth
has increased dramatically.</i>

48:05.522 --> 48:07.524
<i>Throughout the ship, technical crews</i>

48:07.545 --> 48:09.546
<i>are making modifications
to the power grid,</i>

48:09.571 --> 48:11.917
<i>but no one will explain
what those modifications</i>

48:11.918 --> 48:13.145
<i>are for... We have something</i>

48:13.146 --> 48:14.678
<i>we need you to do.</i>

48:14.679 --> 48:16.681
Whatever it is, the answer is no.

48:17.201 --> 48:18.833
Why do you guys have guns?

48:18.834 --> 48:20.467
The armory was on the way.

48:20.468 --> 48:22.470
Where's Cohen? We're gonna need a tech.

48:22.510 --> 48:24.255
Cohen is dead.

48:24.256 --> 48:25.986
Cut in half walking through a door

48:25.987 --> 48:27.427
on the Xuesen, because of you.

48:27.428 --> 48:28.758
I understand you're upset...

48:28.759 --> 48:30.592
You go to hell. Give me my camera back,

48:30.593 --> 48:32.594
- I have work to do...
- You're pissed, I get it.

48:32.955 --> 48:34.836
You want me to feel bad
that you're angry.

48:34.837 --> 48:36.719
You want me to feel guilty
that Cohen is dead.

48:36.753 --> 48:38.079
But I don't.

48:38.080 --> 48:39.872
And I never will, so let's just

48:39.873 --> 48:41.708
skip the bullshit,
to where you agree to help.

48:41.709 --> 48:43.490
- Help you do what?
- The station is going

48:43.491 --> 48:45.240
to destroy us. All of us.

48:45.241 --> 48:46.715
Holden knows how to stop it.

48:46.716 --> 48:47.590
You want answers.

48:47.615 --> 48:48.818
We have them.

48:48.843 --> 48:50.061
And they will save lives.

48:50.086 --> 48:51.933
We need you to get the word out.

48:56.354 --> 48:57.799
Should have led with that.

49:06.544 --> 49:08.545
I need you to keep everyone
out of reactor control.

49:11.304 --> 49:13.331
Do you have anyone down
there you can trust?

49:13.356 --> 49:14.877
Yes, Captain.

49:14.902 --> 49:17.069
I know a couple guy.

49:21.799 --> 49:24.176
No plan survives contact with the enemy.

49:27.480 --> 49:29.341
I'm sorry I drove you away.

49:30.517 --> 49:32.380
We lost so much time together.

49:32.405 --> 49:34.258
You didn't drive me away.

49:35.761 --> 49:37.638
And I'm not leaving again.

49:42.274 --> 49:43.773
Together till the end.

50:25.413 --> 50:26.987
Just you?

50:27.012 --> 50:29.796
Only me wit duty back here, Bosmang.

50:29.821 --> 50:32.242
Reactor control's straight through there.

50:32.243 --> 50:34.102
How long's it take to kill the reactor?

50:34.127 --> 50:36.856
Minimum safe shutdown,
about twenty minutes.

50:36.881 --> 50:38.825
After that, I can take
the power grid offline

50:38.850 --> 50:40.112
any time we want.

51:18.118 --> 51:19.906
Get away from the controls, now!

52:08.616 --> 52:11.045
This is it. Can you uplink here?

52:11.070 --> 52:12.553
I think so. Give me a minute.

52:12.578 --> 52:13.799
- Alex.
- Yeah.

52:13.824 --> 52:15.212
Help her.

52:15.237 --> 52:17.117
I'll watch our backs.

52:17.142 --> 52:18.793
All right.

52:20.538 --> 52:23.770
All right. Let's get
this thing connected.

52:34.883 --> 52:35.751
What do you think that Ashford will do

52:35.776 --> 52:37.294
when he realizes what we're doing?

52:38.128 --> 52:39.380
He's a pirate.

52:39.405 --> 52:40.591
Take a guess.

52:42.916 --> 52:45.349
Before, you had a problem
with me killing Melba.

52:45.374 --> 52:47.309
I don't have time for that now.

52:47.334 --> 52:49.188
If someone comes to stop
us, I'm gonna kill them.

52:51.306 --> 52:53.152
Because it needs to be done.

52:53.740 --> 52:54.760
It does.

52:57.100 --> 52:58.619
Hmm.

52:58.644 --> 53:00.670
Do you think we're gonna die here?

53:01.778 --> 53:04.334
Well, there's a lot more
of them than there is us.

53:05.081 --> 53:06.265
Hmm.

53:07.354 --> 53:08.626
I, um...

53:08.651 --> 53:10.514
I left a lot of people behind,

53:10.539 --> 53:11.843
to come out here.

53:11.868 --> 53:13.518
If we die, I won't get a chance

53:13.543 --> 53:14.979
to explain to them why I left.

53:15.004 --> 53:17.023
What I thought that I would gain.

53:18.171 --> 53:19.690
I left a lot unsaid.

53:19.715 --> 53:21.864
Well, everyone leaves
unfinished business.

53:21.889 --> 53:23.449
That's what dying is.

53:25.967 --> 53:27.290
What about you?

53:28.030 --> 53:30.586
I won't get to shoot that prick, Ashford.

53:31.132 --> 53:32.463
Why do you hate him?

53:33.173 --> 53:35.159
I never met him.

53:35.184 --> 53:37.354
You'd regret not killing a man

53:37.355 --> 53:38.849
you don't even know, just because he's on

53:38.875 --> 53:40.504
- the other side?
- Well, he's sending people

53:40.529 --> 53:42.106
to kill me.

53:43.741 --> 53:45.628
On every side of this are people who have

53:45.653 --> 53:47.613
no reason to hate each other.

53:47.638 --> 53:50.167
Everyone here thinks they're
doing the right thing.

53:50.168 --> 53:51.982
Everyone there thinks they're
doing the right thing.

53:52.007 --> 53:54.040
If we get out of this,
we have to find a way

53:54.065 --> 53:56.919
to understand each other, to explain why

53:56.944 --> 53:59.048
we made the choices that we did.

53:59.073 --> 54:00.841
It is the only way that we can let go

54:00.866 --> 54:02.083
of the hate.

54:07.518 --> 54:08.771
Hate is a burden.

54:11.399 --> 54:13.552
You don't have to carry it with you.

54:19.121 --> 54:20.914
I'm not gonna let anyone hurt you.

54:35.091 --> 54:37.399
They're linking in to the
transmitter array now.

54:37.424 --> 54:39.193
Broadcast should be up soon.

54:39.218 --> 54:40.696
As soon as the other ships go dark,

54:40.721 --> 54:41.698
we need to pull the plug here.

54:41.723 --> 54:42.880
We'll be ready.

54:47.690 --> 54:49.209
How are you holding up?

54:52.479 --> 54:53.841
Thank you for believing me.

54:55.301 --> 54:57.179
I'm not here for you.

54:57.204 --> 54:59.129
Naomi believes you're right.

54:59.155 --> 55:00.728
She would die for you.

55:00.753 --> 55:02.963
I'm here to make sure she doesn't.

55:04.567 --> 55:05.776
<i>You, here.</i>

55:05.801 --> 55:07.758
You, here.

55:09.439 --> 55:11.494
You, with power
certification, over there.

55:12.620 --> 55:14.205
You there, suit up.

55:14.230 --> 55:15.917
You go outside.

55:15.942 --> 55:18.004
Reactor control, come in.

55:18.029 --> 55:21.264
- Faluta!
- What's the problem?

55:21.289 --> 55:23.534
Getting alert on all reactor.

55:23.535 --> 55:25.807
Look like someone preparing
for shut-down sequence!

55:25.832 --> 55:27.727
- On whose orders?
- Mi na sasa.

55:27.752 --> 55:29.898
I call control room. No answer.

55:33.857 --> 55:37.076
Harari! They are in reactor control.

55:41.681 --> 55:43.319
What the felota is this?

55:43.344 --> 55:45.151
Problem?

55:45.176 --> 55:47.049
Someone's routing
massive amounts of power

55:47.074 --> 55:48.693
- to the Comm Laser.
- They tried to get

55:48.718 --> 55:50.429
a message through the Ring before.

55:50.454 --> 55:52.808
Maybe they're trying to
punch through harder.

55:53.789 --> 55:55.437
With the station charging up,

55:55.462 --> 55:56.563
what'll be the point of...

55:58.698 --> 56:01.709
They're trying to destroy the Ring.

56:01.734 --> 56:04.044
- Would that work, ke?
- It won't matter.

56:04.069 --> 56:05.888
A laser shot is a direct attack;

56:05.913 --> 56:07.575
it'll prove that we're a threat.

56:07.576 --> 56:09.709
And the station will kill
everyone and everything

56:09.734 --> 56:11.295
on both sides of the Ring.

56:20.602 --> 56:22.312
<i>Ashford!</i>

56:22.337 --> 56:23.898
<i>We know what you're trying to do.</i>

56:23.923 --> 56:26.027
<i>You cannot destroy the Ring!</i>

56:26.052 --> 56:28.739
You are no longer in
command of this ship.

56:28.764 --> 56:30.242
<i>You don't need to do this.</i>

56:30.267 --> 56:33.015
There's a way to save us all!

56:33.040 --> 56:34.833
That is not the point.

56:35.650 --> 56:37.872
Even if the station
doesn't kill all of us,

56:37.873 --> 56:40.424
now others will come through the Ring.

56:40.449 --> 56:42.698
That is our nature.

56:42.723 --> 56:45.493
<i>We won't be able to resist.</i>

56:45.518 --> 56:48.478
Anybody who has had a child understands

56:48.503 --> 56:50.405
that it is their duty

56:50.430 --> 56:53.382
<i>to leave the world better
than they found it.</i>

56:53.383 --> 56:55.781
<i>Even if we all survive,
we're leaving behind</i>

56:55.807 --> 56:57.592
an unexploded bomb.

56:57.617 --> 57:00.739
Sooner or later, someone will set it off.

57:00.764 --> 57:02.061
If Holden is right,

57:02.086 --> 57:04.728
you will be the one setting it off.

57:10.909 --> 57:13.559
Camina, you are a true Belter.

57:13.584 --> 57:16.715
You saved my life because you are willing

57:16.740 --> 57:18.442
to die for a greater good.

57:18.467 --> 57:20.679
I still am.

57:25.211 --> 57:26.538
Hurry.

57:29.598 --> 57:31.003
Get back to work.

57:34.654 --> 57:36.387
<i>- Are we up yet?</i>

57:36.412 --> 57:38.422
<i>Almost there, almost there.</i>

57:38.447 --> 57:40.977
<i>This is Monica Stewart,
reporting on the Intership</i>

57:41.002 --> 57:42.816
<i>Relief Channel, with an urgent message</i>

57:42.841 --> 57:44.650
<i>for everyone in the flotilla.</i>

57:44.675 --> 57:46.987
<i>I am here with Anna Volovodov.</i>

57:47.012 --> 57:48.531
<i>Some of you may recognize her.</i>

57:48.556 --> 57:51.034
<i>She was instrumental in exposing</i>

57:51.059 --> 57:53.872
<i>UN Undersecretary Errinwright's treason</i>

57:53.897 --> 57:55.500
<i>and helped end the war.</i>

57:55.525 --> 57:57.795
<i>Please listen to what she has to say.</i>

57:57.820 --> 57:59.590
<i>Our lives are depending on it.</i>

57:59.615 --> 58:00.968
<i>I understand</i>

58:00.993 --> 58:02.511
<i>how you all</i>

58:02.536 --> 58:05.248
<i>must be feeling right now.</i>

58:05.972 --> 58:07.102
<i>You're afraid.</i>

58:07.127 --> 58:08.853
The station is doing something

58:08.878 --> 58:11.483
that you don't understand.

58:11.508 --> 58:14.446
And no one will answer your questions.

58:14.471 --> 58:16.241
<i>But I will.</i>

58:17.451 --> 58:19.872
<i>The Station is reacting</i>

58:19.897 --> 58:22.250
<i>as though we are a threat.</i>

58:22.275 --> 58:25.339
<i>It thinks our ships are bombs,</i>

58:25.364 --> 58:27.175
<i>like the skiff that exploded.</i>

58:27.200 --> 58:31.454
<i>And it is charging up to protect itself.</i>

58:31.479 --> 58:32.892
<i>But we can stop it.</i>

58:32.917 --> 58:35.479
<i>We need to power down</i>

58:35.504 --> 58:37.106
<i>every reactor,</i>

58:37.131 --> 58:39.202
<i>on every ship.</i>

58:39.227 --> 58:40.821
<i>This will demonstrate</i>

58:40.846 --> 58:43.726
<i>that we are not a threat.</i>

58:43.751 --> 58:47.057
<i>And the Station will let us go.</i>

58:47.082 --> 58:48.724
<i>This is the time...</i>
I told you to shut down

58:48.725 --> 58:50.847
- that transmission!
- No can do, Bosmang.

58:50.872 --> 58:52.840
They must be hooked
directly into substation.

58:52.865 --> 58:54.384
I mute the feed.

58:54.409 --> 58:56.678
Is what she's saying true?

58:58.232 --> 59:00.477
No have time to debate.

59:01.336 --> 59:03.065
If there a chance,

59:03.090 --> 59:05.401
I say we try.

59:09.094 --> 59:10.952
We not gonna die here.

59:10.977 --> 59:12.984
I said...

59:22.916 --> 59:25.140
We are running out of time, people.

59:25.165 --> 59:27.226
If we delay,

59:27.251 --> 59:30.064
we lose our chance to end this threat

59:30.089 --> 59:32.152
against all of our families,

59:32.177 --> 59:35.238
against all of our homes.

59:35.263 --> 59:38.771
We know what we must do.

59:38.796 --> 59:40.164
Now.

59:40.189 --> 59:43.169
Does anyone else wish to debate with me?

59:56.134 --> 59:57.523
That broadcast will make things

59:57.548 --> 59:58.817
get out of hand quickly.

01:00:00.721 --> 01:00:02.384
My Marines will take care of it.

01:00:05.022 --> 01:00:06.168
Draper, you're up.

01:00:06.193 --> 01:00:08.320
Get your armor.

01:00:19.060 --> 01:00:20.501
Those freaking thieving Belters.

01:00:20.526 --> 01:00:22.188
We don't need armor for this.

01:00:23.202 --> 01:00:24.775
Take what you need and head out.

01:00:25.610 --> 01:00:26.850
Aye-aye, Gunny.

01:00:42.995 --> 01:00:44.690
How much longer?

01:00:44.715 --> 01:00:46.613
I've set the reactor to scram as soon as

01:00:46.638 --> 01:00:48.324
the power grid goes down.

01:00:48.349 --> 01:00:50.147
It'll take a while for the broadcast

01:00:50.172 --> 01:00:51.191
to convince every...

01:00:57.637 --> 01:00:59.371
Airlock!

01:01:07.429 --> 01:01:09.304
Felota!

01:01:09.329 --> 01:01:10.492
Where does this go?

01:01:10.517 --> 01:01:12.349
Exterior elevator.

01:01:12.374 --> 01:01:14.436
Connects directly to the Command deck.

01:01:17.881 --> 01:01:18.942
Shit!

01:01:18.967 --> 01:01:20.506
They killed the power!

01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:21.594
If we can make our way up the shaft,

01:01:21.619 --> 01:01:23.381
maybe we can still stop Ashford.

01:01:23.406 --> 01:01:24.573
Can you keep going?

01:01:24.598 --> 01:01:26.246
Pashang fong.

01:01:26.271 --> 01:01:28.274
You're not leaving me behind.

01:01:29.228 --> 01:01:30.695
Suit up!

01:01:44.588 --> 01:01:46.455
I feel like

01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:48.445
we're trapped in a haunted house.

01:01:48.447 --> 01:01:50.414
And I'm asking you

01:01:50.416 --> 01:01:51.882
to turn out the lights.

01:01:51.884 --> 01:01:53.551
This...

01:01:53.553 --> 01:01:55.820
is a dark time.

01:01:55.822 --> 01:01:58.721
I'm asking you to be brave with me.

01:01:58.723 --> 01:02:00.990
I understand it is a...

01:02:00.992 --> 01:02:02.458
I...

01:02:12.503 --> 01:02:15.604
So much for no weapons on the Behemoth.

01:02:17.441 --> 01:02:19.607
This is Gunnery Sergeant Roberta Draper,

01:02:19.609 --> 01:02:20.975
Martian Marine Corps!

01:02:20.977 --> 01:02:23.644
I am ordering you
to cease your broadcast,

01:02:23.646 --> 01:02:25.413
put down your weapons, and come out

01:02:25.415 --> 01:02:27.448
with your hands raised!

01:02:27.450 --> 01:02:28.830
Bobbie?

01:02:29.752 --> 01:02:31.651
Alex?

01:02:31.653 --> 01:02:32.919
Jesus.

01:02:37.926 --> 01:02:39.993
I want full control of the Comm Laser

01:02:39.995 --> 01:02:41.594
at my station, ke?

01:02:41.596 --> 01:02:43.529
Ya, Bosmang.

01:02:43.531 --> 01:02:46.131
<i>Protocol breach, respond.</i>

01:02:55.675 --> 01:02:56.941
This is a live cable.

01:02:56.943 --> 01:02:58.009
Keep it secure.

01:02:58.011 --> 01:02:59.608
Sorry.

01:03:00.513 --> 01:03:02.985
- Are you all right?
- It's the chemical restraint,

01:03:03.682 --> 01:03:05.616
makes me a little fuzzy.

01:03:05.618 --> 01:03:07.618
Oh, you... you are who tried

01:03:07.620 --> 01:03:08.886
to kill Holden.

01:03:08.888 --> 01:03:10.621
You were in the brig, right?

01:03:10.623 --> 01:03:12.455
What are you doing here?

01:03:12.457 --> 01:03:13.823
They brought me up.

01:03:13.825 --> 01:03:15.725
I have an electrician rating.

01:03:15.727 --> 01:03:17.126
If I remove the restraint,

01:03:17.128 --> 01:03:19.662
would it help you concentrate better?

01:03:26.837 --> 01:03:28.570
Do you think a truly good act

01:03:28.572 --> 01:03:30.639
at the end of your life,

01:03:30.641 --> 01:03:31.740
can make up for the terrible

01:03:31.742 --> 01:03:33.641
things you've done?

01:03:36.145 --> 01:03:38.979
I would like to believe that is true.

01:03:38.981 --> 01:03:40.395
Yeah.

01:03:41.550 --> 01:03:43.816
At least I hope it is.

01:04:13.546 --> 01:04:15.211
What the hell are you doing down here?

01:04:15.213 --> 01:04:16.513
Put down your weapons.

01:04:16.515 --> 01:04:18.214
That ain't gonna happen.

01:04:18.216 --> 01:04:19.849
Anna, keep talking, tell them

01:04:19.851 --> 01:04:20.850
how you feel right now.

01:04:20.852 --> 01:04:23.119
I... I understand,

01:04:23.121 --> 01:04:24.654
what it is

01:04:24.656 --> 01:04:25.788
to fight for something.

01:04:25.790 --> 01:04:27.890
I have done a lot of it.

01:04:27.892 --> 01:04:29.892
But I've also seen how it can turn

01:04:29.894 --> 01:04:31.694
into blind hatred.

01:04:31.696 --> 01:04:33.028
Alex, listen to me!

01:04:33.030 --> 01:04:35.030
You need to surrender now!

01:04:35.032 --> 01:04:36.197
If you make us come in there,

01:04:36.199 --> 01:04:37.865
somebody's gonna get hurt!

01:04:42.205 --> 01:04:44.906
- Okay!
- Don't you do it.

01:04:46.909 --> 01:04:48.956
I'm putting my guns down!

01:04:50.112 --> 01:04:51.912
Coming out now!

01:04:53.716 --> 01:04:55.379
I just wanna talk!

01:04:56.585 --> 01:04:58.651
- All right!
- This is a stall.

01:04:58.653 --> 01:05:00.920
What is it with you and these assholes?

01:05:05.960 --> 01:05:08.560
I don't care that she's your friend.

01:05:08.562 --> 01:05:10.829
If she tries to stop us,
I'm putting her down.

01:05:48.866 --> 01:05:50.698
I'm scared too.

01:05:50.700 --> 01:05:53.034
But I am trying, to not

01:05:53.036 --> 01:05:54.869
let my fear...

01:05:54.871 --> 01:05:56.937
I don't want to hurt you.

01:05:56.939 --> 01:05:58.639
- Don't make me.
- Actually,

01:05:58.641 --> 01:06:02.609
I'm here to keep Angus from hurting you.

01:06:02.611 --> 01:06:04.044
Your broadcast is causing a panic,

01:06:04.046 --> 01:06:05.145
- it has to stop.
- Yeah,

01:06:05.147 --> 01:06:06.846
that's not gonna happen, Gunny.

01:06:06.848 --> 01:06:07.847
Holden says,

01:06:07.849 --> 01:06:10.682
that station is gonna wipe us all out

01:06:10.684 --> 01:06:13.419
unless we make this happen now.

01:06:16.824 --> 01:06:19.158
I was with him, in that thing.

01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:21.826
It did something to him.

01:06:21.828 --> 01:06:23.728
I'm not even sure
it's the Holden you know

01:06:23.730 --> 01:06:25.363
- that came back.
- He's running around,

01:06:25.365 --> 01:06:28.132
putting his life on the line,
trying to save everyone.

01:06:28.134 --> 01:06:30.735
That's the Holden I know.

01:06:30.737 --> 01:06:32.169
Take 'em out!

01:06:33.338 --> 01:06:34.771
Stand down!

01:06:34.773 --> 01:06:37.174
God damn it, stand down!

01:07:06.669 --> 01:07:07.901
Don't shoot!

01:07:11.874 --> 01:07:13.206
Alex?

01:07:13.208 --> 01:07:14.407
I'm good.

01:07:14.409 --> 01:07:16.423
I'm good.

01:07:18.113 --> 01:07:20.427
How many more?

01:07:23.284 --> 01:07:25.050
Clear.

01:07:29.423 --> 01:07:31.389
Shit.

01:07:34.227 --> 01:07:36.060
Put the guns down here.

01:07:42.401 --> 01:07:44.034
Gunny, you okay?

01:07:44.036 --> 01:07:46.035
Gunny, she's hit!

01:07:49.074 --> 01:07:50.907
They'll be sending a lot more people,

01:07:50.909 --> 01:07:52.775
so whatever you've got to do,

01:07:52.777 --> 01:07:55.410
do it fast.

01:08:05.189 --> 01:08:06.454
What are you doing?

01:08:06.456 --> 01:08:08.289
Don't stop, we'll catch up.

01:08:24.072 --> 01:08:27.805
There's no way we stay ahead
of those suits.

01:08:27.808 --> 01:08:29.808
You keep going.

01:08:29.810 --> 01:08:32.444
I can handle Diogo Harari.

01:08:32.446 --> 01:08:34.354
No, you can't.

01:08:34.357 --> 01:08:36.081
Give me the grenades.

01:08:39.986 --> 01:08:42.020
I'm sorry I tried to kill you.

01:08:42.022 --> 01:08:44.455
- There's no need...
- Tell Naomi I said that.

01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:48.992
I will.

01:09:01.005 --> 01:09:03.272
What's going on?

01:09:03.274 --> 01:09:04.372
Drummer?

01:09:21.991 --> 01:09:24.925
<i>We still have a chance,</i>

01:09:24.926 --> 01:09:27.728
<i>but we have to do it together.</i>

01:09:31.166 --> 01:09:33.032
<i>The worst minds</i>

01:09:33.033 --> 01:09:36.502
<i>show us who we are.</i>

01:09:36.504 --> 01:09:39.005
Doctor, this is not the time.

01:09:39.006 --> 01:09:40.805
<i>Commander, please listen.</i>

01:09:40.808 --> 01:09:43.308
<i>I feel like it's our fault.</i>

01:09:43.310 --> 01:09:44.542
<i>My fault.</i>

01:09:46.546 --> 01:09:48.013
<i>And if Ashford's right,
it won't make any difference</i>

01:09:48.015 --> 01:09:50.182
<i>if we shut down the Prince.</i>

01:09:50.184 --> 01:09:52.216
<i>But if he's wrong,
shouldn't we at least try?</i>

01:10:11.435 --> 01:10:12.468
Ah!

01:10:22.512 --> 01:10:24.012
<i>Drummer?</i>

01:10:24.014 --> 01:10:25.079
<i>Drummer!</i>

01:10:25.081 --> 01:10:27.348
Please tell me I didn't hit you too.

01:10:29.185 --> 01:10:32.853
Now I know why
you don't need to carry a gun.

01:10:32.855 --> 01:10:34.855
<i>Oh, that's a pretty good trick.</i>

01:10:36.125 --> 01:10:37.457
<i>Are you okay?</i>

01:10:37.459 --> 01:10:40.024
Eh, I'll live.

01:10:41.030 --> 01:10:43.262
<i>I think you better go on without me.</i>

01:10:54.041 --> 01:10:56.274
Captain! Thomas Prince just go dark.

01:10:56.276 --> 01:10:58.209
All reactor off.

01:10:58.211 --> 01:11:00.245
Other ships too.

01:11:01.381 --> 01:11:02.647
Where's my god damned laser?

01:11:02.649 --> 01:11:04.748
Almost there,
just gotta check the buffer.

01:11:09.121 --> 01:11:11.388
- Buffer is good.
- Laser control to me.

01:11:11.390 --> 01:11:13.424
- Lock target.
- Ya, Bosmang.

01:11:13.426 --> 01:11:15.472
Comm Laser charging.

01:11:16.394 --> 01:11:18.194
- Ready.
- Firing.

01:11:26.904 --> 01:11:27.969
- What happened?
- We missed.

01:11:27.971 --> 01:11:30.138
- Laser was misaligned.
- How?

01:11:30.140 --> 01:11:31.907
Damage from slowdown, maybe?

01:11:31.909 --> 01:11:33.608
Compensating.

01:11:41.184 --> 01:11:43.084
We need to fire again!

01:11:43.086 --> 01:11:44.118
Now!

01:11:52.928 --> 01:11:54.661
We're running out of time, keep talking.

01:11:54.663 --> 01:11:56.261
<i>Keep talking.</i>

01:11:56.263 --> 01:11:58.664
<i>I'm... I'm not sure how much longer</i>

01:11:58.666 --> 01:12:01.667
<i>we're going to be able
to keep this going.</i>

01:12:18.550 --> 01:12:20.617
Do we have a target lock
on the Ring, yet?

01:12:20.619 --> 01:12:21.752
Almost there!

01:12:42.639 --> 01:12:44.339
I love you.

01:12:53.516 --> 01:12:55.516
We're unarmed!

01:12:55.518 --> 01:12:58.152
Don't shoot!

01:12:58.154 --> 01:12:59.685
We're coming out!

01:13:25.278 --> 01:13:26.677
I know.

01:13:26.679 --> 01:13:29.580
You're trying to save lives.

01:13:29.582 --> 01:13:32.015
I am too!

01:13:32.017 --> 01:13:33.216
But we're on the brink right now,

01:13:33.218 --> 01:13:35.084
because we keep reacting to things

01:13:35.086 --> 01:13:36.386
we don't understand!

01:13:39.024 --> 01:13:41.090
<i>We're scared, we're hurt,</i>

01:13:41.092 --> 01:13:42.624
<i>and we're reaching for violence</i>

01:13:42.626 --> 01:13:44.460
<i>because we can't figure out what to do.</i>

01:13:44.462 --> 01:13:46.762
But just this once,

01:13:46.764 --> 01:13:49.695
can't we try something else?

01:13:50.701 --> 01:13:53.100
Ashford, you know me!

01:13:53.102 --> 01:13:56.409
I stopped following fanatics
a long time ago.

01:13:58.541 --> 01:14:00.408
Shoot them.

01:16:02.820 --> 01:16:04.853
I guess it worked.

01:16:27.810 --> 01:16:30.476
<i>You haven't been straight
with me, Miller.</i>

01:16:30.478 --> 01:16:33.009
<i>There's something you're not telling me.</i>

01:16:34.148 --> 01:16:35.815
<i>Oh, really?</i>

01:16:35.817 --> 01:16:38.484
<i>After all the pain and death,
you just flip a switch,</i>

01:16:38.486 --> 01:16:40.285
<i>and we're free to go.</i>

01:16:40.287 --> 01:16:42.454
<i>Just like that.</i>

01:16:42.456 --> 01:16:43.822
<i>Nice try.</i>

01:16:48.228 --> 01:16:50.327
<i>I think you were trying
to open the Ring gates</i>

01:16:50.329 --> 01:16:51.629
<i>from the beginning.</i>

01:16:51.631 --> 01:16:53.330
<i>That was the plan.</i>

01:16:53.332 --> 01:16:55.466
<i>And what I want to know now is,</i>

01:16:55.468 --> 01:16:56.834
<i>are we...</i>

01:16:56.836 --> 01:16:58.669
<i>I mean humanity...</i>

01:16:58.671 --> 01:17:00.803
<i>are we part of that plan?</i>

01:17:03.842 --> 01:17:05.441
<i>I don't believe you did it</i>

01:17:05.443 --> 01:17:07.644
<i>out of the goodness of your heart.</i>

01:17:12.583 --> 01:17:14.950
<i>It was never about helping us.</i>

01:17:20.858 --> 01:17:23.958
<i>We know all of our divisions.</i>

01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:26.516
<i>All of our hatreds.</i>

01:17:27.530 --> 01:17:29.530
<i>They didn't just magically disappear</i>

01:17:29.532 --> 01:17:32.565
<i>the moment you set us free.</i>

01:17:48.983 --> 01:17:51.706
<i>You've given us a new frontier.</i>

01:17:52.553 --> 01:17:55.386
<i>1,300 habitable systems on the other side</i>

01:17:55.388 --> 01:17:57.889
<i>of those Rings.</i>

01:17:57.891 --> 01:18:00.491
<i>You know we're gonna go.</i>

01:18:00.493 --> 01:18:03.227
<i>We won't be able to resist.</i>

01:18:03.229 --> 01:18:06.396
<i>It's gonna be another
blood-soaked gold rush.</i>

01:18:15.473 --> 01:18:17.406
<i>Am I scared?</i>

01:18:17.408 --> 01:18:20.242
<i>Yeah, you're god damn right I'm scared.</i>

01:18:20.244 --> 01:18:21.911
<i>And I think you know why.</i>

01:18:21.913 --> 01:18:23.746
<i>When you connected me to the Station,</i>

01:18:23.748 --> 01:18:24.646
<i>I saw something.</i>

01:18:26.583 --> 01:18:30.885
<i>The civilization
that built the Rings is gone.</i>

01:18:30.887 --> 01:18:32.534
<i>Wiped out.</i>

01:18:33.590 --> 01:18:35.656
<i>What could have killed them?</i>

01:18:35.658 --> 01:18:37.624
That's what I'd like to know.

01:18:39.929 --> 01:18:42.463
Gonna need a ride.
