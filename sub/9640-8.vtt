00:15.074 --> 00:18.243
Alex, did you make those
brownies? - Oh, gosh.

00:28.955 --> 00:31.022
Pfft! Ugh!

00:31.057 --> 00:34.059
It's so not easy slaving
over a hot wand.

00:34.093 --> 00:37.262
Cheater! You don't see me taking
out the garbage with my wand.

00:37.296 --> 00:41.099
Give me this. Ho! Oh!

00:41.133 --> 00:43.301
I told you I just
baked with that wand.

00:45.671 --> 00:48.506
Hey, alex. Oh,
you made your brownies.

00:50.109 --> 00:52.010
Oh! They're so good.

00:52.044 --> 00:53.678
You know, I've never seen you bake.

00:55.114 --> 00:58.550
Hey, I've got flour on my apron.

00:58.584 --> 01:02.354
And... sweat on my brow.

01:02.388 --> 01:04.623
What are you calling me, a liar?

01:04.657 --> 01:08.493
No, I just came here to invite you
to the pop culture convention.

01:08.527 --> 01:11.896
Hold on, I got to think of
a lie on why I can't go.

01:11.931 --> 01:16.067
Come on, alex, we get to dress up like
characters from cool comics and movies.

01:16.102 --> 01:18.670
Would you go if I told
you it was my birthday?

01:18.704 --> 01:22.240
I... I know that.

01:22.274 --> 01:25.910
That is why I made you these brownies.
Yay! Happy birthday!

01:25.945 --> 01:29.347
Please, alex, I'm finally old
enough to enter the costume contest.

01:29.382 --> 01:31.282
I want you there to
help me with my costume.

01:31.584 --> 01:34.085
Give me a real reason why
you won't go to popcon.

01:34.120 --> 01:38.323
Popcon's in town? Hey,
theresa, popcon's in town!

01:38.357 --> 01:41.493
- Popcon's in town?
- Popcon is in town?

01:41.527 --> 01:45.897
Popcorn's in town?
That doesn't make any sense.

01:45.931 --> 01:47.932
Why am I so excited?

01:50.202 --> 01:53.204
* well, you know everything's
gonna be a breeze *

01:53.239 --> 01:55.507
* that the end will,
no doubt justify the means *

01:56.075 --> 01:58.810
* you can fix any problem with the
slightest of ease yes, please *

01:58.844 --> 02:00.845
* but you might find out
it'll go to your head *

02:01.347 --> 02:02.547
* when you write a report
on a book you never read *

02:03.382 --> 02:05.450
* with the snap of your fingers
you can make your bed *

02:05.484 --> 02:09.988
* that's what I said everything
is not what it seems *

02:10.021 --> 02:13.658
* when you can get all you
wanted in your wildest dreams *

02:13.693 --> 02:17.562
* you might run into trouble
if you go to extremes *

02:17.596 --> 02:22.200
* because everything
is not what it seems *

02:22.234 --> 02:25.336
* everything is not what it seems *

02:25.371 --> 02:29.407
* when you can have what you
want by the simplest of means *

02:29.442 --> 02:33.044
* be careful not to mess
with the balance of things *

02:33.079 --> 02:37.215
* because everything is not *

02:37.249 --> 02:39.384
* what it seems *

02:51.163 --> 02:52.764
Jerry, what are you doing?

02:53.032 --> 02:55.834
Putting snacks in your purse
for later at the convention.

02:55.868 --> 03:00.772
I mean, who's gonna pay $6.
50 for a spicy, cheesy pretzel-dog?

03:00.806 --> 03:03.108
Supersonica doesn't carry a purse.

03:03.142 --> 03:05.343
Ok.

03:05.377 --> 03:07.979
Well, then d-battery guy does.

03:08.013 --> 03:11.015
whoa! What is that?

03:11.050 --> 03:14.152
It's the alarm in the lair.
Emergency wizards are coming.

03:14.186 --> 03:16.154
There must be a crisis
in the wizard world.

03:19.792 --> 03:21.626
Get it off me! Get it off me!

03:36.242 --> 03:39.544
Oh. What does that big one do?

03:42.081 --> 03:43.982
Turns on my reading light.

03:49.255 --> 03:52.791
Emergency wizards with
important wizard business.

03:52.825 --> 03:55.627
Hang on. You guys
just walked in here?

03:55.661 --> 03:58.363
Where's the usual flash of light,
puff of smoke?

03:58.397 --> 04:00.031
Yeah, about that.

04:00.065 --> 04:02.500
Someone in the department
filed a complaint,

04:02.535 --> 04:04.469
So now we just walk in.

04:05.771 --> 04:09.040
Secondhand entry smoke is
a proven health hazard.

04:09.074 --> 04:13.778
The wizard council requires the
services of alex, max and justin russo.

04:13.813 --> 04:17.348
- Where's alex?
- Dude, what is with the noise?

04:17.382 --> 04:20.851
Don't you know my Saturday's
my "sleep till Sunday" day?

04:20.886 --> 04:25.056
There's an emergency at popcon and
we need all three of you to help.

04:25.090 --> 04:27.458
Ugh. I do not want to go to popcon.

04:27.493 --> 04:29.561
That place is filled
with geeks and weirdoes.

04:29.595 --> 04:33.264
Focus. This is important business.

04:33.299 --> 04:35.633
Young wizards love popcon

04:35.668 --> 04:39.504
Because they blend in with all the
other costumed geeks and weirdoes...

04:41.707 --> 04:43.975
Thank you.

04:44.009 --> 04:48.179
Unfortunately, these wizards use
their magic all willy-nilly,

04:48.214 --> 04:50.215
Thus threatening to expose us all.

04:50.249 --> 04:52.951
Ah! I get it. You want us to
patrol the convention room floor

04:52.985 --> 04:55.086
And put a stop to these hooligans.

04:55.120 --> 04:57.355
Well, we want you
to keep an eye out,

04:57.389 --> 05:00.091
But if you want to call it "patrol,
" that's fine.

05:00.125 --> 05:04.429
Awesome! Sweet. I'll get us some
walkie-talkies. We'll synchronize our
watches.

05:04.463 --> 05:07.899
Does everyone know the international
tactical hand signals?

05:07.933 --> 05:11.469
Mm. I know a hand signal.

05:11.503 --> 05:13.605
- Peace! I'm out.
- Hey.

05:13.639 --> 05:15.573
You're not getting out of this.

05:15.608 --> 05:18.409
It's part of your
required wizard training.

05:18.444 --> 05:21.579
And I'll put a gold star on
your community service record.

05:25.684 --> 05:30.622
no. I can't go on patrol at popcon.
I already told harper I wouldn't go.

05:30.656 --> 05:33.458
Do what you always do:
Make up a reason why you're going.

05:33.492 --> 05:37.328
I can't do that. I lie to her
about magic all the time.

05:37.363 --> 05:40.632
I just lied to her about those stupid
brownies. And it's her birthday.

05:40.666 --> 05:44.936
- I didn't feel good about it.
- Oh! Lookie there, alex has feelings.

05:44.970 --> 05:47.238
I know. I'll hide from her.

05:47.273 --> 05:49.107
Feelings gone.

05:49.141 --> 05:52.310
Look, we gotta go now.
So you better change quick.

05:52.344 --> 05:55.546
What are you gonna dress up as? - Oo,
um, I'm gonna dress up

05:55.581 --> 05:57.248
As a super-sleepy annoyed girl.

06:14.233 --> 06:19.270
Oh, my goodness.
I'm in the belly of a nerd beast.

06:19.305 --> 06:23.107
Are you gonna keep that thing
on all day? - I have to.

06:23.142 --> 06:28.079
If chico loco is unmasked,
he loses more than his strength.

06:28.113 --> 06:29.847
He loses his dignity.

06:33.919 --> 06:37.088
I... I am shamed.

06:37.122 --> 06:38.690
I have no dignity.

06:40.459 --> 06:42.193
But it was getting hot in there.

06:44.296 --> 06:47.098
Oh, jerry, remember our
first popcon? - Yeah.

06:47.132 --> 06:51.336
It was in reno, nevada and you
dressed up like calico girl.

06:51.370 --> 06:53.871
That wasn't me.

06:53.906 --> 06:56.074
I'm gonna go buy you a gift.

06:59.078 --> 07:01.446
- Oh. Hey, there's hugh normous.
- Hey, hugh.

07:01.580 --> 07:04.582
- What are you doing here?
- I listen to the emergency wizard scanner

07:04.616 --> 07:07.151
And thought I'd help out.
Having a giant on the lookout

07:07.186 --> 07:09.220
Will discourage any
wizard horseplay.

07:09.254 --> 07:12.357
Oh, that is so cool.
When are we gonna meet the giant?

07:12.391 --> 07:16.194
You just did. It's me.
Look at this tiny comic book in my hand.

07:16.228 --> 07:19.230
Oh, my gosh.
You really are a giant.

07:22.101 --> 07:24.969
Well, at least I can go right to
bed when this whole thing's over.

07:25.004 --> 07:28.106
- I didn't bother wearing a costume.
- What are you talking about?

07:28.140 --> 07:30.375
That's the best pajama
girl costume here.

07:30.409 --> 07:33.978
Oh! Oh, man! There's a pajama girl?

07:34.013 --> 07:37.215
What is with you people?

07:37.249 --> 07:39.751
Come on. Let's get to the
information booth. - Ok.

07:41.387 --> 07:43.554
All right. Let's fan out.

07:43.589 --> 07:45.623
"fan out?" hold on.

07:45.657 --> 07:47.825
I've got walkie-talkies.

07:47.860 --> 07:51.596
And I made a grid of the convention room
floor and assigned everyone sectors.

07:51.630 --> 07:53.831
All right. You, here,
you're in this sector.

07:53.866 --> 07:57.468
You, hugh, you're in
this sector. - Wait.

07:57.503 --> 08:00.538
What's that spot back in
the corner off the grid?

08:00.572 --> 08:02.707
That's the galactic
kettle corn stand.

08:02.741 --> 08:05.009
Oh. Harper hates
galactic kettle corn.

08:05.044 --> 08:08.146
- I'm gonna hide over the.
- That's not your sector, sister!

08:10.482 --> 08:14.385
Hey, you guys! It's me,
harper, as battle diva.

08:14.420 --> 08:17.822
- Hardly recognize me, right?
- Hardly.

08:17.856 --> 08:19.891
Would you guys mind
holding my place in line?

08:20.259 --> 08:22.560
I've been trying to get battle
diva's autograph all morning.

08:22.594 --> 08:24.462
We kinda wanted to look around.

08:24.496 --> 08:26.264
But it's just that
it's my birthday.

08:26.365 --> 08:28.132
And I really want to
get some kettle corn.

08:28.333 --> 08:30.368
I thought you hated
kettle corn. - I do,

08:31.003 --> 08:33.871
But I'm trying to practice discipline and
force myself to eat foods I don't like.

08:33.905 --> 08:36.573
I leave you with the
battle diva battle cry.

08:36.607 --> 08:39.342
Battle diva, rise to the
stars where you belong!

08:43.182 --> 08:45.550
Let's go, supersonica.

08:45.584 --> 08:49.821
D-battery guy needs to recharge
with some nebula nachos.

08:49.855 --> 08:53.825
Honey, I told harper we'd hold her spot.
It's her birthday.

08:53.859 --> 08:58.796
Oh, sweetie, that is so nice how you
care about our children's friends.

09:00.099 --> 09:01.732
See ya.

09:08.674 --> 09:10.174
No, I can't!

09:20.385 --> 09:24.021
A-ha! Rogue wizard.

09:24.056 --> 09:25.890
Buddy, you're coming with me.

09:32.331 --> 09:35.333
Lies, lies I need a disguise

09:35.367 --> 09:38.402
But with a mask! Oh, no!

09:41.273 --> 09:43.441
Something's not right here.

09:45.077 --> 09:49.947
Why would a warrior who
never sleeps need pajamas?

09:49.982 --> 09:52.950
Excuse me! This is all wrong here!

09:58.924 --> 10:01.826
- Whew! That was close.
- Yeah, that was a close one.

10:01.860 --> 10:05.429
Yeah, you're telling me.
Wait a minute. Oh, gosh!

10:05.464 --> 10:08.866
You're in violation of the costume
quick exchange in the first degree.

10:08.901 --> 10:10.301
We're taking her in. Grab her.

10:10.536 --> 10:13.337
Wizard code violation 37294. Wait!

10:13.372 --> 10:18.643
- No mask. 293.
- Wait. How did you see that?

10:18.677 --> 10:21.045
I'm not gonna lie.
I've been off sector and off grid,

10:21.079 --> 10:23.581
Because I suspected you all along.

10:23.615 --> 10:25.616
We're gonna need that
costume for evidence.

10:25.651 --> 10:27.585
it's all yours.

10:32.724 --> 10:35.693
- Of course, she got away.
- It's shimmering.

10:35.727 --> 10:38.296
- She charmed it!
- Of course she charmed it.

10:38.330 --> 10:40.398
This probably has all
of battle diva's powers.

10:40.432 --> 10:42.366
Even her power to make
you say things twice?

10:42.401 --> 10:44.502
Even her power to make
you say things twice?

10:46.138 --> 10:48.573
We gotta contain this.
I never understood that power.

10:48.607 --> 10:51.375
- I never understood that power.
- Oh!

10:51.410 --> 10:54.312
- Whoa. That was close.
- yes, it was.

10:54.346 --> 10:58.783
Ok, justin. You got me. Oh, gosh!

10:58.817 --> 11:04.222
Russo, you're in complete violation
of wizard conduct code 99244.

11:04.256 --> 11:07.124
Oh, you're in pajamas. 245.

11:07.159 --> 11:09.060
alex?

11:09.094 --> 11:11.796
What are you doing here?

11:11.830 --> 11:16.801
Surprise! Happy birthday! - What?
You're here for my birthy?

11:16.835 --> 11:21.005
Because it looks like you're here with
this guy in the awesome monster costume.

11:21.039 --> 11:24.909
- Who are you?
- I... I'm jeremy.

11:24.943 --> 11:27.912
From... Science.

11:29.982 --> 11:33.384
Uh, he's jeremy from science.
But I'm not with him.

11:33.418 --> 11:37.188
Jeremy from science?
Is there even a jeremy in science?

11:37.222 --> 11:42.326
Of course there is.
He... He has a huge crush on you.

11:42.361 --> 11:46.664
Well, hello, jeremy from science.

11:46.698 --> 11:49.267
Your costume doesn't
look store-bought at all.

11:49.301 --> 11:51.469
Th... Uh, thank you.

11:51.503 --> 11:55.206
Alex helped me with it.
No, she didn't. She didn't help me.

11:55.240 --> 11:57.241
What? You helped jeremy
with his costume,

11:57.276 --> 11:59.477
But refused to help me
your best friend with mine?

11:59.511 --> 12:02.213
I wasn't helping him.
I didn't even mean to be here.

12:02.247 --> 12:05.750
you obviously did.
You're dressed as pajama girl.

12:05.784 --> 12:09.220
How could you do this to me?
I want the truth. No more lies.

12:09.254 --> 12:12.223
I'm sorry. I can't tell you.

12:12.257 --> 12:15.126
You never tell the truth.
Like that one time we were making

12:15.160 --> 12:18.396
Bottle cap belts in sub station.
You said, "I'll be back in a minute,"

12:18.430 --> 12:21.565
And then went into the food storage
locker and didn't come out for hours.

12:21.600 --> 12:23.401
Do you have another
friend in there?

12:23.435 --> 12:25.903
Harper, please. I'm sorry.

12:25.937 --> 12:28.706
I'm sorry, too.
You ruined my birthday.

12:28.740 --> 12:30.574
Thanks a lot.

12:30.609 --> 12:34.312
By the way, your pajama girl
costume looks totally slept in.

12:47.607 --> 12:50.909
Jerry. Jerry, come here.
I have to tell you a secret.

12:50.944 --> 12:53.846
Come here. Closer. Closer!

12:53.880 --> 12:56.348
Crouch down, honey.
I don't want anyone to hear.

12:56.382 --> 12:59.351
Great. Now, wait for me
here till I come back. Bye!

12:59.385 --> 13:05.224
Argh! She tricked d battery guy.

13:06.259 --> 13:08.093
She's good.

13:10.663 --> 13:12.397
Justin, I need to talk to you.

13:12.599 --> 13:14.867
Harper thinks I'm a liar.
The only thing I can do

13:14.901 --> 13:17.736
Is completely come clean and
finally tell her I'm a wizard.

13:21.307 --> 13:23.108
That's the only thing you can do?

13:23.142 --> 13:25.277
Well, it's the first
thing I thought of.

13:25.812 --> 13:28.847
And you know me, I don't usually keep
thinking of things once I think of
something.

13:28.882 --> 13:31.950
You can't tell her that. It's a
serious violation of the wizard code.

13:31.985 --> 13:35.020
We may have an
exposure code yellow.

13:35.054 --> 13:38.056
Hugh, I'm not gonna tell you again,
I'm right next to you.

13:38.091 --> 13:41.026
No, no, justin,
harper can keep a secret.

13:41.060 --> 13:43.595
- No one would ever know.
- Harper would know.

13:43.696 --> 13:46.565
Once one mortal knows something,
let's face it, mortals are blabby.

13:46.599 --> 13:48.634
but it's true.

13:48.668 --> 13:51.069
You should surprise her.

13:51.104 --> 13:53.572
Friendships are all about
surprising each other,

13:53.606 --> 13:57.643
Because no one but your friends
really know what you like.

13:57.677 --> 14:01.280
- Here's some cheese, justin.
- What a surprise! I really like this.

14:01.314 --> 14:04.716
See? I know what he likes
and I surprised him.

14:04.751 --> 14:06.551
Friendship.

14:06.586 --> 14:08.854
Great. And um, now,
instead of fighting crime,

14:08.888 --> 14:11.590
You can fight crackers
with your sprayable cheese.

14:11.624 --> 14:15.527
Wait. Or you can spray
harper with cheese.

14:15.561 --> 14:18.063
Look, just because you and
harper are in some fight,

14:18.197 --> 14:20.565
- I'm not gonna do your dirty work.
- It's not my dirty work.

14:20.600 --> 14:23.235
- You would save our friendship.
- Uh, no, I'm not.

14:23.269 --> 14:26.838
Really? Because she's telling
everybody you guys are engaged.

14:26.873 --> 14:29.241
That girl has no boundaries.

14:32.712 --> 14:36.782
Mr. Russo, I just want to say goodbye,
since alex and I are no longer friends.

14:36.816 --> 14:39.718
Once justin and I start dating,
I'll be around,

14:39.752 --> 14:42.621
But until that happens,
this is goodbye.

14:42.655 --> 14:45.824
Aw! It's gonna be...

14:45.858 --> 14:48.360
...Ok.

14:48.394 --> 14:50.562
battle diva!

14:50.596 --> 14:52.597
Hi, justin.

14:52.632 --> 14:55.901
It is I, the destroyinator,

14:55.935 --> 14:59.037
- Your arch-enemy.
- Oh, my gosh!

14:59.072 --> 15:02.307
You wanna duel? We're gonna
be a superhero couple.

15:02.342 --> 15:04.710
First, jeremy from science.
Now, you.

15:04.744 --> 15:06.912
I'm part of a love triangle.

15:06.946 --> 15:08.947
We're not engaged!

15:14.887 --> 15:18.457
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha!

15:18.491 --> 15:22.194
Looks like the destroyinator
has won this battle!

15:22.228 --> 15:26.131
Oh, this reeks like cheese!
You've ruined my costume!

15:27.233 --> 15:30.302
Oh, no! Your costume
is totally destroyed.

15:30.336 --> 15:32.971
Now, I can't even enter
the costume contest.

15:33.006 --> 15:34.973
Or can you?

15:35.008 --> 15:38.777
Surprise! Happy birthday. Again.

15:38.811 --> 15:44.149
- Why would I accept your gift?
- Because it's an exact replica.

15:44.183 --> 15:46.818
Why don't you give it
to jeremy from science?

15:46.853 --> 15:50.422
Jeremy from science wants
you to have it. - He does?

15:51.824 --> 15:53.525
Fine. I'll take it.

15:53.559 --> 15:56.728
But not for you.
For jeremy from science.

15:56.763 --> 15:59.931
I think I'll harper-ize
it /ewith this wig.

16:03.236 --> 16:04.703
Chico loco.

16:04.737 --> 16:06.705
I need you to hold this
place in line for me.

16:06.739 --> 16:09.875
- Eh... No, thanks.
- Oh, I see.

16:09.909 --> 16:13.178
Mom gave you more muscle padding so you
think you're stronger than me, huh?

16:13.212 --> 16:17.949
Uh-huh. That's right.
More padding, more loco.

16:17.984 --> 16:20.752
- Got a problem with that?
- I do.

16:20.787 --> 16:24.122
- Let's wrestle and find out.
- Bring it!

16:24.157 --> 16:25.590
- Ha!
- Ha!

16:28.127 --> 16:29.961
Whoa! Put me down!

16:29.996 --> 16:32.264
Put me down!

16:38.905 --> 16:42.674
Ugh. That's the worst balloon
giraffe I've ever seen.

16:42.708 --> 16:44.876
But you know what? It's a cute hat.

16:46.779 --> 16:47.779
Next.

16:50.650 --> 16:53.385
I'll give you an extra
one so that you can, uh,

16:53.419 --> 16:57.155
Sell it and buy
yourself a real hat.

16:57.190 --> 17:02.260
Oh, yeah? Well, supersonica
versus battle diva. Bring it on!

17:04.063 --> 17:05.896
Ok. No biting. No biting.

17:16.442 --> 17:17.876
Why is harper wearing that?

17:18.077 --> 17:19.978
I gave it to her so
she'll forgive me.

17:20.213 --> 17:22.781
When she wins the costume contest,
we'll be friends again.

17:22.882 --> 17:26.384
That's a fully-loaded wizard-powered
costume with superhero capabilities.

17:26.419 --> 17:29.888
- Is thaa problem?
- It can fly, ricochet lasers,

17:29.922 --> 17:34.593
- Deflect bullets and shoot fire.
- Ok, so it's a problem.

17:36.295 --> 17:38.330
next up, the battle divas.

17:38.364 --> 17:39.998
no, wait!

17:42.135 --> 17:44.669
We'll be ok as long as she
doesn't say battle diva's cry.

17:44.704 --> 17:46.771
That's what activates her powers.

17:46.806 --> 17:50.876
Battle diva, rise to the
stars where you belong!

17:52.445 --> 17:53.678
That's the one.

17:58.951 --> 18:01.653
Whoa!

18:01.687 --> 18:03.255
Whoa-no!

18:12.498 --> 18:15.800
What is going on here? - We have a
potential wizard exposure in progress.

18:15.835 --> 18:19.037
I accidentally gave her a costume that
has powers but she doesn't know it.

18:19.071 --> 18:22.774
She just knows she's flying. - Everyone,
backstage before someone gets hurt.

18:27.146 --> 18:30.882
All right. We don't have a much time
before people start asking questions.

18:30.917 --> 18:34.186
Guys, why is harper flying around
like she has wizard powers?

18:34.220 --> 18:36.221
Less time than I thought.

18:36.255 --> 18:39.057
Goblin, can you figure out a way
to draw everyone's attention?

18:39.091 --> 18:42.194
All right, well, I'm a goblin.
That usually does it.

18:42.228 --> 18:44.296
Make my hair look a little crazy.

18:55.875 --> 18:58.343
Ok, everybody, take a position.

19:00.079 --> 19:03.615
Beep beep boop bop bop.

19:03.649 --> 19:07.852
This is officer lamp. I have a
situation frank-cody-roger-niner.

19:07.887 --> 19:11.089
I need authorization for
an insta-rig. Thank you.

19:15.127 --> 19:16.995
Open the curtain, alex.

19:23.135 --> 19:26.071
Hey, I can see the ropes!

19:29.442 --> 19:34.879
Yep, those are definitely ropes.
Cannot hide these. Uh-uh.

19:34.914 --> 19:37.916
This is by far the worst
illusion I've ever seen.

19:37.950 --> 19:40.285
Ta-da!

19:45.057 --> 19:48.760
How did the rope get there?
Whatever. That was cool!

19:53.065 --> 19:55.066
I think we have a winner.

19:55.101 --> 19:58.270
Harper finkle as battle diva!

20:03.609 --> 20:06.511
Oh, my gosh, alex, now I see
what you've been doing all day!

20:06.545 --> 20:09.080
You set this all up so I'd
have the best birthday ever.

20:09.115 --> 20:11.249
With the rigs,
the costumes and the ropes,

20:11.284 --> 20:14.019
Even introduced me to
jeremy from science.

20:14.053 --> 20:16.354
well, I'm glad you liked it.

20:16.389 --> 20:18.990
You know, I owe you an apology.
You've done all this

20:19.025 --> 20:21.793
And all I've done is doubt
you and be a horrible friend.

20:21.827 --> 20:26.064
Alex, you're the best friend ever.
T"nk you for telling me the truth.

20:28.968 --> 20:32.604
Harper, there's something
I need tw tell you.

20:32.638 --> 20:34.773
Jeremy doesn't go to our school.

20:34.807 --> 20:38.476
I knew it was too good to be true.

20:38.511 --> 20:42.314
Because he's a goblin.
From the wizard world.

20:42.348 --> 20:46.985
And I would know that because...
I'm a wizard.

20:47.019 --> 20:50.355
Hold on a second.

20:50.389 --> 20:52.590
But he was into me, right?

20:52.625 --> 20:55.894
Harper, can you forget about
that for one second please?

20:55.928 --> 20:58.663
I'm trying to tell you
that I'm a wizard.

20:58.698 --> 21:01.333
oh, alex. You're so funny.

21:01.367 --> 21:04.669
Really, I am. Here. Pick a card.

21:04.704 --> 21:07.906
Alex, that's lame.
There's no way a stupid magic trick

21:07.940 --> 21:09.808
Is gonna make me think
you're a wizard.

21:12.311 --> 21:14.713
But look at where we are.

21:17.983 --> 21:19.984
We're in space!

21:20.019 --> 21:24.155
And I have a birthday
cupcake for you.

21:26.726 --> 21:29.561
In space!

21:29.595 --> 21:33.365
Oh, my gosh, I'm having a
birthday cupcake in space!

21:33.399 --> 21:36.601
With a wizard!
My best friend's a wizard!

21:36.635 --> 21:39.637
I'm so glad I don't have to
keep it from you anymore.

21:39.672 --> 21:44.042
Me, too! Wait, so you have powers?
Like you can fly and teleport places?

21:44.076 --> 21:46.911
Wizards are kind of like
superheroes. - Yeah.

21:46.946 --> 21:49.614
Except we don't do anything
for the good of society.

21:50.583 --> 21:52.450
Happy birthday!

21:55.354 --> 21:59.390
ok, so we didn't get you
anything for your big day,

21:59.424 --> 22:01.792
But we wanted to show
you something instead.

22:01.827 --> 22:04.462
They wanted to show you something.

22:07.666 --> 22:10.167
I said it on the cab ride
home and I'll say it again:

22:10.202 --> 22:13.671
Alex has violated wizard code by
revealing our secret to harper.

22:13.705 --> 22:17.208
I know how you feel, but we all
agreed to trust alex and harper.

22:18.944 --> 22:21.445
Between me and you,
they're gonna blow it by Saturday.

22:21.480 --> 22:23.247
We'll use mind-erase
spell on harper

22:23.282 --> 22:25.983
And bing-bang-boom,
we're back in business.

22:30.422 --> 22:32.556
What? That's just
your food storage.

22:32.591 --> 22:35.259
That's what you used to think.

22:45.003 --> 22:47.805
Whoa!

22:55.480 --> 22:57.982
This is where you do inventory?

22:59.217 --> 23:01.686
This is gonna take a
while for it to sink in.
