WEBVTT

02:26.814 --> 02:27.648
Ed!

02:29.358 --> 02:30.651
Nadine?

02:30.776 --> 02:32.319
Ed, I've come
to tell you something.

02:33.404 --> 02:35.239
Honey, where's your car?
How'd you get here?

02:35.364 --> 02:37.158
- I walked.
- You walked?

02:37.283 --> 02:38.284
What's with the shovel?

02:38.409 --> 02:40.452
That's what I want
to talk to you about.

02:40.578 --> 02:42.204
- It is?
- Yes.

02:42.329 --> 02:44.790
Ed, I've come to tell you

02:44.915 --> 02:46.167
I've changed.

02:47.376 --> 02:48.544
You have?

02:48.669 --> 02:51.714
Yes, and, Ed, you know
I love you so much...

02:52.756 --> 02:54.425
I know you do, Nadine.

02:55.301 --> 02:57.845
But I've been a selfish bitch

02:57.970 --> 02:59.847
to you all these years,

02:59.972 --> 03:01.724
and you've been a saint.

03:01.849 --> 03:03.517
- What?
- Listen to me.

03:04.518 --> 03:05.853
I've known since forever

03:05.978 --> 03:08.355
you love Norma
and she loves you.

03:08.480 --> 03:11.525
I kept the two of you apart
because of my jealousy.

03:12.985 --> 03:15.070
And I manipulated you, Ed.

03:15.196 --> 03:16.864
No, no, you haven't,
Nadine.

03:16.989 --> 03:19.909
Oh, no,
you know it's true.

03:20.034 --> 03:21.994
I guilted you to stay,

03:22.119 --> 03:23.787
and you're so good
you stayed

03:23.913 --> 03:25.372
and gave up your love.

03:25.497 --> 03:27.875
Oh, God, Ed,

03:28.000 --> 03:30.002
I want you to be free.

03:32.421 --> 03:34.215
I'm fine now.

03:35.466 --> 03:36.800
You asked about this shovel.

03:36.926 --> 03:40.262
Well, I'm shoveling myself
out of the shit.

03:40.387 --> 03:42.723
Have you been watching
that show of Jacoby's?

03:45.226 --> 03:46.644
You know I have.

03:46.769 --> 03:48.062
Nadine...

03:48.187 --> 03:50.397
Don't worry about me.

03:50.522 --> 03:52.441
Run to her.

03:52.566 --> 03:56.612
Enjoy the rest
of your lives together.

03:56.737 --> 03:59.323
I am so happy

03:59.448 --> 04:01.283
just thinking of you two

04:01.408 --> 04:03.452
being happy.

04:03.577 --> 04:06.413
Ed, I love you
and always will,

04:06.538 --> 04:08.290
but true love is

04:08.415 --> 04:11.418
giving the other
what makes them happy.

04:12.962 --> 04:14.046
Jeez,

04:14.171 --> 04:15.839
you big lug,

04:15.965 --> 04:18.425
how beautiful is this!

04:18.550 --> 04:20.719
Nadine, I want you
to think real hard about

04:20.844 --> 04:23.555
what you're saying because
you're not making any sense.

04:24.515 --> 04:27.309
Honey, tomorrow, you're gonna wish
you never said these things.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.770
Ed, I told you,

04:29.895 --> 04:32.314
I walked all the way here.

04:32.439 --> 04:35.317
I had plenty of time
to think, turn back,

04:35.442 --> 04:36.819
but I didn't

04:36.944 --> 04:41.031
because this is how
I really feel.

04:41.156 --> 04:42.908
And you can thank Dr. Amp,

04:43.033 --> 04:45.286
our old friend Dr. Jacoby.

04:45.411 --> 04:47.121
To me, he's about
the only one around here

04:47.246 --> 04:48.789
telling it like it is.

04:48.914 --> 04:51.792
So the gist of it is:

04:51.917 --> 04:55.296
Ed, you are free.

04:55.421 --> 04:57.798
Go and enjoy.

05:01.260 --> 05:03.762
Oh.

05:30.497 --> 05:31.832
<i>Am I right?</i>

05:33.083 --> 05:34.710

07:02.881 --> 07:04.716
because I have
something to tell you.

07:06.718 --> 07:09.430
You're changing the name
to Norma's Double R.

07:09.555 --> 07:10.681
I knew you'd come around.

07:11.682 --> 07:13.976
No, actually, um,

07:14.101 --> 07:16.854
I'm exercising my option

07:16.979 --> 07:18.355
for you to buy me out.

07:19.106 --> 07:19.982
What?

07:21.024 --> 07:21.984
Is this a joke?

07:22.109 --> 07:24.778
No, you heard me, Walter.

07:24.903 --> 07:26.280
But why?

07:26.405 --> 07:27.573
Family reasons.

07:29.158 --> 07:31.326
I thought you told me
you didn't have any family.

07:31.452 --> 07:34.496
No, I have a wonderful family.

07:34.621 --> 07:35.998
And I want to take care of them.

07:37.332 --> 07:40.586
I just spread myself too thin,
worrying about all these diners.

07:40.711 --> 07:43.255
I...I want to spend
more time at home.

even if I don't understand it.

08:10.449 --> 08:11.909
I'm just sorry
you're not going to be part

08:12.034 --> 08:14.036
of what is going to be
a great success.

08:14.161 --> 08:15.579
Oh, and I know it will be,

08:15.704 --> 08:18.207

the best of luck, Walter.

08:19.875 --> 08:20.959
But...

08:21.084 --> 08:22.336
I looked at my contract.

08:22.461 --> 08:24.046
I'm gonna keep
the Double R as agreed,

08:24.171 --> 08:28.091
and you're gonna buy my shares
of the other franchises.

08:28.217 --> 08:30.552
Soon to be seven.

08:30.677 --> 08:34.306
Seven diners full of happy,
satisfied customers.

08:34.431 --> 08:37.976
And I'm happier
with just one.

08:44.024 --> 08:45.651
For the record,

08:45.776 --> 08:47.653
I'd just like to say,

08:47.778 --> 08:49.196
you're making a huge mistake.

18:20.308 --> 18:21.267
Jeffries.

18:24.354 --> 18:25.396

18:28.108 --> 18:30.860

18:30.985 --> 18:32.195
<i>What?</i>

18:33.321 --> 18:35.240
<i>I called Ray.</i>

18:36.783 --> 18:38.701
So you did send him?

18:42.580 --> 18:44.499
Did you call me five days ago?

18:46.626 --> 18:48.795
<i>I don't have
your number.</i>

18:54.592 --> 18:56.678
So it was someone else
who called me?

18:58.513 --> 19:00.723
<i>We used to talk.</i>

19:00.849 --> 19:03.101
Yes, we did.

19:04.727 --> 19:07.230
Well, now,

19:07.355 --> 19:09.149
I'm not gonna talk about Judy.

19:09.274 --> 19:12.443
In fact, we are not gonna
talk about Judy at all.

19:15.196 --> 19:17.532
1989.

19:17.657 --> 19:21.786
You showed up at FBI
headquarters in Philadelphia

19:21.911 --> 19:23.788
and said you'd met Judy.

19:31.379 --> 19:35.216
<i>So you</i> are <i>Cooper?</i>

19:40.972 --> 19:42.682
Phillip.

19:42.807 --> 19:45.518
Why didn't you want
to talk about Judy?

19:47.270 --> 19:48.646
Who is Judy?

19:49.355 --> 19:51.816
Does Judy want something
from me?

19:53.735 --> 19:56.529
<i>Why don't you
ask Judy yourself?</i>

19:58.072 --> 20:00.366
<i>Let me write it down for ya.</i>

20:27.268 --> 20:29.103
Who is Judy?

20:29.229 --> 20:32.232
<i>You've already met Judy.</i>

20:33.233 --> 20:35.193
What do you mean,
I've met Judy?

20:53.169 --> 20:55.964
Who is Judy?

20:56.089 --> 20:57.882
Who is Judy?

21:33.501 --> 21:36.045
I recognized you
back at the farm.

21:36.170 --> 21:38.006
You're FBI.

21:38.131 --> 21:39.382
How do you figure that?

21:39.507 --> 21:40.883
'Cause I seen your picture

21:41.009 --> 21:42.343
in your fancy FBI suit.

21:42.468 --> 21:43.845
Don't come any closer.

21:45.930 --> 21:47.515
Where'd you see that picture?

21:47.640 --> 21:49.183
My mom had it.

21:50.351 --> 21:51.477
Who's your mom?

21:52.854 --> 21:53.980
Audrey Horne.

21:56.899 --> 21:58.443
And your name's Cooper.

22:08.828 --> 22:10.747
Don't ever threaten me again.

22:14.375 --> 22:16.836
Get in the truck.
We'll talk on the way.

25:12.386 --> 25:13.429
Why?

25:19.268 --> 25:20.770
There is no why.

25:23.147 --> 25:24.273
I did do it.

25:25.316 --> 25:27.193
No.

25:27.318 --> 25:29.570
No, she did it.

25:29.695 --> 25:31.197
She did it.

25:31.322 --> 25:33.157
I can't.

25:33.282 --> 25:34.200
No.

25:36.285 --> 25:37.578
I did it.

25:40.164 --> 25:42.708
No.
No, Steven.

25:42.833 --> 25:45.253
Steven, stop it.

25:45.378 --> 25:48.589
You didn't do anything, okay?

25:48.714 --> 25:51.425
You were fucking stoned.

25:51.551 --> 25:53.678
What the fuck did she give you?

25:56.305 --> 25:58.266
Give me the gun, okay?

25:58.391 --> 26:00.142
Mm-mm.

26:01.727 --> 26:03.187
Are you gonna come up with me?

26:03.312 --> 26:04.313
No.

26:04.438 --> 26:06.440
No, and you're not going either.

26:11.487 --> 26:13.114
Look at me.

26:13.239 --> 26:14.865
I'm a high-school graduate.

26:15.950 --> 26:17.368
I'm a high-school graduate.

26:17.493 --> 26:20.079
Oh, fuck...

26:26.711 --> 26:27.712
You see this, yeah?

26:27.837 --> 26:30.381
No. No.

26:30.506 --> 26:31.966
Stop it, don't do that.

26:32.091 --> 26:33.884
I'm gonna get this thing in.

26:36.178 --> 26:38.222
What?

26:38.347 --> 26:40.516
No‒don't, no.

26:40.641 --> 26:43.144
I'm gonna
put this thing here.

26:43.269 --> 26:44.604
No, no.

26:44.729 --> 26:45.563
Right through here.

26:45.688 --> 26:46.606
No.

26:46.731 --> 26:48.065
No, Steven.

26:50.026 --> 26:50.860
- No.
- It's‒

26:50.985 --> 26:51.902
it's gonna end it.

26:52.028 --> 26:53.029
No.

26:59.493 --> 27:01.495
And when I‒
when I see you come up...

27:05.458 --> 27:08.836
But...but...

27:08.961 --> 27:10.463
I may not even

27:10.588 --> 27:12.340
see you there, I mean...

27:14.383 --> 27:16.427
I mean...

27:17.720 --> 27:18.929
I mean gone.

27:20.681 --> 27:22.099
Where will I be?

27:22.224 --> 27:23.976
Will I be with the rhinoceros?

27:26.228 --> 27:28.773
The lightning
in the bottle, hmm?

27:31.150 --> 27:32.318
Please.

27:37.156 --> 27:41.494
It's okay.
It's okay, okay.

27:42.870 --> 27:44.622
Or will I be completely, uh,

27:44.747 --> 27:47.750
like‒like‒

27:47.875 --> 27:50.002
turquoise?

27:50.127 --> 27:51.379
Hmm?

27:51.504 --> 27:53.047
I feel something.

27:53.172 --> 27:54.757
Fuck.

27:54.882 --> 27:56.717
Or...

27:56.842 --> 27:57.718
Fuck.

28:02.640 --> 28:03.933
This is the end.

28:04.058 --> 28:06.560
I got a duty to do.

28:06.686 --> 28:09.271
Do whatev‒
whatever you want.

28:10.564 --> 28:12.566
I liked fucking you.

28:12.692 --> 28:13.859
Did I tell you?

28:16.362 --> 28:17.863
I liked it a lot.

28:20.991 --> 28:23.953
I liked to get down
and fight with you

28:24.078 --> 28:25.454
and fuck.

28:30.084 --> 28:31.752
Just so you know...

28:35.464 --> 28:36.924
Why are you crying?

28:38.175 --> 28:39.468
Why are you...

28:39.593 --> 28:42.722
Stop doing that. Stop it.

28:43.889 --> 28:45.182
You're making me cry.

28:45.307 --> 28:47.852
Stop it.

28:57.194 --> 28:58.112
Shit.

28:58.237 --> 28:59.280
Fuck. Fuck, fuck.

29:21.177 --> 29:22.011
No.

29:23.429 --> 29:24.263
No.

30:32.206 --> 30:35.251
He lives in that trailer
right there.

It's good to see you, Renee.

31:44.904 --> 31:46.113
You got a death wish?

31:46.238 --> 31:47.990
'Cause I'll fucking kill you.

31:48.657 --> 31:51.160
Don't talk to my wife. Ever!

31:51.285 --> 31:53.287
I wa‒I was just saying‒
I was try‒I was just trying‒

31:53.412 --> 31:54.788
To‒to what?

31:54.914 --> 31:57.416
I try‒I was just
trying to be polite.

31:57.541 --> 31:59.168
I-I like her.

32:03.839 --> 32:05.132
Stop it, Chuck, stop it!

32:07.176 --> 32:08.302
Stop it, Chuck, stop it!

32:08.427 --> 32:09.303
Stop it, Chuck!

32:11.430 --> 32:12.723
Oi!

32:12.848 --> 32:13.766
You better stop this.

32:13.891 --> 32:15.017
Fuck you, punk!

32:20.105 --> 32:21.315
Oi.

32:25.945 --> 32:27.863
Chuck, talk to me!

32:33.953 --> 32:35.037
Baby!

32:35.162 --> 32:36.747
Are you all right, mate?

32:36.872 --> 32:38.248
Yeah.

32:38.374 --> 32:40.000
Hey, anybody,

32:40.125 --> 32:42.044
these guys are really hurt.

32:42.169 --> 32:43.963
Dial 911 now!

32:44.088 --> 32:46.715
I tried not to hit them
too hard, James, honest.

32:46.840 --> 32:48.133
It's okay.

32:48.258 --> 32:49.885
Thanks, by the way.

32:53.973 --> 32:56.558
I am so sorry, Renee.

32:56.684 --> 32:58.602
I did not mean
for this to happen.

32:58.727 --> 33:00.104
I really didn't.

33:02.648 --> 33:04.024
Chuck, baby, talk to me.

33:04.149 --> 33:05.651
Oh, God.

33:05.776 --> 33:07.695
His eyes don't look right.

33:23.627 --> 33:24.837
Um, they're here, sir,

33:24.962 --> 33:26.672
Douglas Jones
and his wife, Jane,

33:26.797 --> 33:27.881
ready for questioning.

33:32.261 --> 33:33.345
He give you any trouble?

33:33.470 --> 33:34.805
Uh, no, no.

33:34.930 --> 33:37.349
Um, but the kids
aren't too happy.

33:37.474 --> 33:39.184
Kid-s?

33:39.309 --> 33:40.477
Plural?

33:42.730 --> 33:44.356
Kid-s?

33:53.657 --> 33:54.950
Wilson!

33:58.203 --> 33:59.872
Roger, get in here a minute.

34:07.379 --> 34:08.380
Yes, sir?

34:09.339 --> 34:10.632
Roger,
have we heard from Anthony?

34:10.758 --> 34:11.592
No, sir.

34:13.177 --> 34:14.636
Well, find him for me.

34:14.762 --> 34:15.637
Now.

34:26.065 --> 34:27.232
Hi, hun.

34:29.860 --> 34:30.986
Oh, shit.

34:33.781 --> 34:34.948
Hold on.

34:45.417 --> 34:47.586
Yeah, one down, one to go.

34:48.295 --> 34:50.005
Yeah, French fries.

34:50.130 --> 34:51.423
And extra ketchup.

35:07.481 --> 35:08.524
Put him in eight.

35:09.608 --> 35:10.692
Put him in eight.

35:19.451 --> 35:20.953
Back up.

35:21.078 --> 35:22.496
What'd that
gloved freak do now?

35:22.621 --> 35:24.039
Shut up, Chad!

35:24.164 --> 35:25.874
Shut up, Chad.

35:25.999 --> 35:27.292
What's he doing
in the cell?

35:27.417 --> 35:29.086
Don't pay any attention
to him.

35:29.211 --> 35:30.129
- Hawk.
- Hmm?

35:30.254 --> 35:32.131
Are those guys okay?

35:32.256 --> 35:34.341
Both in intensive care.

35:34.466 --> 35:37.469
They're both in intensive care.

35:54.403 --> 35:55.654
What the hell?

36:17.718 --> 36:19.386
Shut up!

36:19.511 --> 36:21.471
Shut up!

36:34.026 --> 36:35.777
The government
does it all the time.

36:37.070 --> 36:39.656
People get paid for it,
too, just like us.

36:39.781 --> 36:40.991
Damn right.

36:41.116 --> 36:42.367
Two-faced fucks.

36:43.410 --> 36:46.330
So-called
Christian nation.

36:47.706 --> 36:49.333
Might as well be

36:49.458 --> 36:50.834
"thou shalt kill."

36:53.086 --> 36:55.672
"Show no mercy."
"Forgive no one."

36:55.797 --> 36:57.299
Fuck 'em in the ass.

36:57.424 --> 36:59.384
It's a nation of killers,
killing all along.

36:59.509 --> 37:01.303
Killed damn near
all the Indians, didn't they?

37:01.428 --> 37:02.471
Yeah.

37:02.596 --> 37:06.391
But my fun's over
when we actually kill someone.

37:06.516 --> 37:09.102
It's no fun
torturing a corpse.

37:09.228 --> 37:11.188
I haven't got
to torture anybody

37:11.313 --> 37:12.564
in a fuck of a long time, Hutch.

37:12.689 --> 37:13.523
I know.

37:14.399 --> 37:15.984
Just hasn't worked out lately.

37:16.109 --> 37:17.527
It's fucked.

37:18.654 --> 37:20.447
You know I hate it

37:20.572 --> 37:22.616
when you get me
these little ketchup packs.

37:22.741 --> 37:24.409
I'm sorry.
It's all they had.

37:26.536 --> 37:27.955
Did you get me dessert?

37:28.080 --> 37:29.373
You know I did.

37:33.502 --> 37:34.795
I love you, Hutch.

37:34.920 --> 37:36.421
I love you, Chantal.

37:38.715 --> 37:39.591
Mmm.

37:42.844 --> 37:43.887
Beautiful night.

37:50.352 --> 37:51.395
Mars.

37:59.820 --> 38:01.363
Here you go, Dougie.

38:19.006 --> 38:20.507
Is it delicious?

38:21.800 --> 38:23.135
Delicious.

38:27.180 --> 38:28.640
Oh, Dougie.

38:29.808 --> 38:32.644
It's like all our dreams
are coming true.

38:41.403 --> 38:42.404
True.

39:59.606 --> 40:00.440
<i>Good-bye, Norma.</i>

40:00.565 --> 40:01.691
<i>We'll see what they can do.</i>

40:01.817 --> 40:03.568
<i>I'm not worried.
Everything will be fine.</i>

40:03.693 --> 40:05.320
<i>The old team together again.</i>

40:05.445 --> 40:06.488
<i>Nothing can stop us.</i>

40:06.613 --> 40:08.698
<i>The old team. Yeah.</i>

40:08.824 --> 40:11.660
<i>- Good-bye, dear.
- Good-bye, Mr. DeMille.</i>

40:13.286 --> 40:14.204
<i>How'd it go?</i>

40:14.329 --> 40:15.580
<i>It couldn't have gone better.</i>

40:15.705 --> 40:16.748
<i>It's practically set.</i>

40:16.873 --> 40:18.792
<i>Course, he has to finish
this picture first.</i>

40:18.917 --> 40:20.127
<i>But mine will be his next.</i>

40:20.252 --> 40:22.212
<i>Get Gordon Cole.</i>

40:23.130 --> 40:24.756
<i>Tell him to forget
about our car.</i>

40:25.841 --> 40:27.843
<i>Tell him he can get another
old car someplace</i>‒

41:49.925 --> 41:51.635
Mom, what was that?

42:06.566 --> 42:09.653
<i>Deputy Hawk?
Deputy Hawk?</i>

42:09.778 --> 42:12.072
<i>Margaret Lanterman's
on line one.</i>

42:12.197 --> 42:13.490
Okay, Lucy.

42:20.497 --> 42:22.582
Margaret,
what can I do for ya?

42:24.125 --> 42:25.126
Hawk.

42:28.755 --> 42:30.173
I'm dying.

42:35.178 --> 42:36.680
I'm sorry, Margaret.

42:41.601 --> 42:43.895
You know about death...

42:46.314 --> 42:48.525
...that it's just a change...

42:49.776 --> 42:51.111
...not an end.

42:56.324 --> 42:57.325
<i>Hawk.</i>

43:00.870 --> 43:02.747
It's time.

43:07.043 --> 43:08.712
There's some fear...

43:10.463 --> 43:13.091
...some fear in letting go.

43:18.221 --> 43:20.390
Remember what I told you.

43:22.309 --> 43:25.020
I can't say more over the phone.

43:27.439 --> 43:30.525
But you know what I mean,

43:30.650 --> 43:32.485
from our talks,

43:32.611 --> 43:36.448
when we were able to speak
face-to-face.

43:42.078 --> 43:45.749
Watch for that one,

43:45.874 --> 43:48.627
the one I told you about,

43:48.752 --> 43:51.338
the one under the moon

43:51.463 --> 43:53.673
on Blue Pine Mountain.

43:57.636 --> 43:59.220
<i>Hawk.</i>

44:02.974 --> 44:05.477
My log is turning gold.

44:14.152 --> 44:16.321
The wind is moaning.

44:21.493 --> 44:22.869
I'm dying.

44:34.964 --> 44:36.424
Good night, Hawk.

44:44.474 --> 44:45.892
Good night, Margaret.

44:56.277 --> 44:57.904
Good-bye, Margaret.

45:52.751 --> 45:54.127
What's up?

45:54.252 --> 45:56.087
Hawk intercommed us,

45:56.212 --> 45:57.839
told us to meet him here.

46:19.819 --> 46:23.531
Margaret Lanterman
passed away tonight.

46:26.701 --> 46:29.913
The Log Lady's dead?

47:41.985 --> 47:44.612
I'm just tired of waiting
for the phone.

47:46.030 --> 47:47.657
Billy hated that place, but...

47:48.950 --> 47:49.784
Oh.

47:50.743 --> 47:52.078
You got your coat on.

47:53.079 --> 47:54.622
Of course I do.

47:54.747 --> 47:55.874
We're going out.

47:57.542 --> 47:59.919
We're going to the Roadhouse.

48:00.044 --> 48:02.547
I will need my coat.

48:02.672 --> 48:04.424
Yeah, well, yeah, I just...

48:07.635 --> 48:09.679
You're really something, Charlie.

48:09.804 --> 48:11.556
What the hell?

48:12.765 --> 48:14.309
Put your coat on, Audrey.

48:15.852 --> 48:18.229
It's already late
and I'm so sleepy.

48:19.272 --> 48:20.607
Let's go.

48:20.732 --> 48:23.443
Would you just stop complaining?

48:23.568 --> 48:26.112
God, what a pain
in the ass you are.

48:26.237 --> 48:28.698
I mean, can't you just
do something for someone else

48:28.823 --> 48:32.076
without ruining it
by continually complaining?

48:32.201 --> 48:35.413
You're such a whiner,
it's like being with a sick dog.

48:36.581 --> 48:38.291
Are you gonna put your coat on

48:38.416 --> 48:40.793
or talk me to death
right here,

48:40.919 --> 48:42.587
on the threshold?

48:45.965 --> 48:48.384
You know,
when Billy and I go places,

48:48.509 --> 48:51.763
he never speaks to me
the way you do, Charlie.

48:51.888 --> 48:53.097
Yes.

48:54.599 --> 48:56.142
Well,

48:56.267 --> 48:57.852
I am Charlie

48:57.977 --> 49:00.605
and he is Billy.

49:01.439 --> 49:04.651
And I like Billy better.

49:04.776 --> 49:06.569
Sensational.

49:06.694 --> 49:08.821
Now, are you gonna
put your coat on,

49:08.947 --> 49:11.366
or shall we stand here
all night?

49:11.491 --> 49:13.201
Here you go again.

49:13.326 --> 49:16.871
You can't stop
for one fucking second.

49:16.996 --> 49:19.415
Audrey, seriously,

49:19.540 --> 49:22.085
in one fucking second,
I'm taking my coat off

49:22.210 --> 49:24.545
and staying in for the night.

49:24.671 --> 49:27.173
You're the one that wanted
to go to the Roadhouse,

49:27.298 --> 49:28.257
not me.

49:28.383 --> 49:29.759
It's impossible.

49:29.884 --> 49:33.721
I mean, I see it
right before my eyes,

49:33.846 --> 49:36.307
but I never really
saw it before.

49:36.432 --> 49:39.102
It's absolutely
fucking impossible.

49:39.227 --> 49:41.020
What is it now, Audrey?

49:41.145 --> 49:42.438
You, Charlie, it's you.

49:42.563 --> 49:45.608
I-I-I just never
really saw you before

49:45.733 --> 49:47.443
the way I'm seeing you now.

49:52.323 --> 49:54.534
Like I'm meeting
a different person.

49:58.121 --> 49:59.622
Who are you, Charlie?

50:03.543 --> 50:06.254
Okay, off comes the coat.

50:19.767 --> 50:21.853
How can you be like this?

50:21.978 --> 50:23.771
I hate your fucking guts!

50:23.896 --> 50:25.148
I hate you!

50:25.273 --> 50:27.775
Do you know how much
