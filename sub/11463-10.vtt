WEBVTT

00:13.638 --> 00:14.923
Thank you.

00:28.570 --> 00:30.811
Can I get
my big brother Oscar

00:30.905 --> 00:33.237
and his beautiful bride
Jessica up here

00:33.283 --> 00:35.274
for their first dance
as husband and wife?

00:35.285 --> 00:36.365
for their first dance
as husband and wife?

00:36.453 --> 00:38.660
Give them some love.

00:51.301 --> 00:53.838
Yay, get up there!

00:53.928 --> 00:55.884
- Dale, Oscar!
- Go, Oscar!

01:14.365 --> 01:16.356
I told you this was embarrassing, right?
We're waltzing.

01:16.367 --> 01:18.198
I told you this was embarrassing, right?
We're waltzing.

01:18.244 --> 01:21.111
Suck it up, babe. It's classy, okay?
Just be classy.

01:21.164 --> 01:24.156
- Angel.
- Just be classy.

01:26.628 --> 01:28.209
It'll all be over
really soon.

01:28.254 --> 01:30.836
I don't want it
to be over.

01:30.924 --> 01:32.334
And I'll always
love you for it.

01:32.425 --> 01:34.416
I'll always love you.

01:47.148 --> 01:49.230
Aw. Now if we can have
the father of the bride

01:49.275 --> 01:50.606
join his daughter.

01:50.693 --> 01:52.729
Mr. Stowe, come on up.

02:06.751 --> 02:08.537
Is everything
all right, Mrs. Stowe?

02:08.628 --> 02:10.619
I'm sorry, no.
We have to leave.

02:10.630 --> 02:12.746
I'm sorry, no.
We have to leave.

02:12.841 --> 02:14.377
I don't understand.

02:14.467 --> 02:17.254
This thing,
this sickness

02:17.303 --> 02:19.339
they're reporting,
they say it's spreading.

02:19.430 --> 02:22.046
You're safe here, Mrs. Stowe.
The hotel is very secure.

02:22.100 --> 02:24.637
I'm not disparaging
the hotel.

02:26.312 --> 02:28.473
They're talking about
closing the border.

02:28.565 --> 02:31.147
We want our family
north of it before then.

02:31.192 --> 02:32.568
And our guests.

02:32.652 --> 02:34.517
These are mostly
rumors, Mrs. Stowe.

02:34.612 --> 02:37.479
- It's just Internet gossip.
- We have friends who know.

02:37.574 --> 02:39.906
We'll make an announcement
in a few moments.

02:39.993 --> 02:42.826
Ilene, may I have
this dance?

02:42.912 --> 02:45.654
Yes, the last.

02:48.293 --> 02:50.079
Get the cars.

02:59.220 --> 03:01.302
That was perfect.

03:01.347 --> 03:03.338
Dad? Daddy? Mom!

03:03.349 --> 03:04.384
Dad? Daddy? Mom!

03:04.475 --> 03:06.466
- Charles? Honey? Charles.
- Come on, come on.

03:06.769 --> 03:07.895
Hector, call a doctor.

03:08.229 --> 03:10.811
- Let's give him air.
- Whoa, whoa.

03:10.899 --> 03:13.561
Charles? Please,
please, please...??

03:16.279 --> 03:18.520
Jessica, when I tell you
to breathe, you breathe and listen.

03:18.615 --> 03:19.570
- You understand?
-Okay.

03:27.957 --> 03:29.948
Breathe.

03:29.959 --> 03:31.119
Breathe.

03:31.169 --> 03:33.706
- Charles, come on.
- Keep trying to call somebody.

03:36.299 --> 03:38.381
It's awful.
It's just awful.

03:41.804 --> 03:43.931
Honey! Honey!

03:49.812 --> 03:51.222
Help us!

03:57.987 --> 03:59.898
Help us!

03:59.989 --> 04:01.900
Please!

04:30.478 --> 04:32.309
You want
to stop, Dad?

04:32.355 --> 04:34.562
Can't keep resting
each half hour.

04:36.359 --> 04:38.065
- No.
- You should take a break.

04:38.152 --> 04:40.188
I'm okay. I'm okay.
You have it.

04:40.238 --> 04:42.729
Let's find some shade.

04:42.824 --> 04:44.485
Let's just keep moving.

04:44.575 --> 04:46.611
Try and find some shelter
for the night.

04:52.000 --> 04:53.956
Hey.

04:54.043 --> 04:55.874
I got it.

05:09.142 --> 05:11.007
Let's see about a ride.

05:17.900 --> 05:20.391
- It's right there.
- Pass the rebar.

05:20.445 --> 05:22.902
- Come on, Chris, wake up.
- I'm gonna go.

05:22.989 --> 05:25.401
No, you're not.

05:25.450 --> 05:26.986
We need supplies.

05:27.076 --> 05:28.691
We don't know
what's over there.

05:28.786 --> 05:30.572
Let me find out.

05:30.663 --> 05:32.619
You should learn this.

05:32.707 --> 05:34.538
We can go together
once I'm done.

05:34.584 --> 05:37.417
Look, I can go look over there
while you do this, Dad.

05:37.462 --> 05:40.374
Two birds, one stone.
I'll come back if I see anything.

05:40.423 --> 05:42.414
- Chris.
- I can protect myself, you know that.

05:42.425 --> 05:43.505
- Chris.
- I can protect myself, you know that.

05:43.551 --> 05:45.087
I'm good at this.

05:45.178 --> 05:46.839
That's what worries me.

05:48.514 --> 05:50.505
See anything,
double-time your ass back here.

05:50.516 --> 05:51.676
See anything,
double-time your ass back here.

05:51.768 --> 05:53.429
Got it.

05:53.478 --> 05:55.469
- Promise?
- Cross my heart.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.595
- Promise?
- Cross my heart.

05:56.689 --> 05:57.804
Chris.

06:35.353 --> 06:37.093
Or we can head into town.

06:37.188 --> 06:39.179
Look, we head into town,
we check out all the shops,

06:39.190 --> 06:40.305
Look, we head into town,
we check out all the shops,

06:40.358 --> 06:41.973
the houses in the hills,
we stock up.

06:42.068 --> 06:43.979
We got supplies
already, Brandon.

06:44.070 --> 06:45.685
We don't know
what it's like back home.

07:22.942 --> 07:24.352
Let's go!

07:24.402 --> 07:26.108
- Let's go.
- You all right?

07:26.195 --> 07:28.026
- I got water. I got supplies.
- Are you hurt?

07:28.114 --> 07:29.979
- No, I'm good.
- What the hell happened?

07:30.074 --> 07:32.065
I saw the infected. I ran like
I said I would, but we got to go now.

07:32.076 --> 07:34.032
I saw the infected. I ran like
I said I would, but we got to go now.

07:34.120 --> 07:35.656
Let's go.

08:09.030 --> 08:10.520
You okay?

08:10.573 --> 08:12.939
Yeah, fine.

08:13.034 --> 08:15.525
Don't worry.

08:15.578 --> 08:17.364
You'll heal faster
if we drive.

08:19.123 --> 08:20.909
It's already
getting better.

08:32.929 --> 08:35.136
Dead air
everywhere, man.

08:40.520 --> 08:43.182
Check the glove
compartment.

08:59.997 --> 09:01.533
So where we going?

09:01.582 --> 09:03.573
Away from what's
behind us for now.

09:03.584 --> 09:04.699
Away from what's
behind us for now.

09:04.752 --> 09:06.333
How long can
we do that for?

09:13.094 --> 09:14.379
What?

09:16.389 --> 09:18.630
Dad, what's wrong?

09:22.311 --> 09:23.926
- You're up.
- Really?

09:24.021 --> 09:25.932
Good time to learn.

09:26.023 --> 09:27.604
No traffic.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.231
Come on.
Let's do it.

09:36.075 --> 09:38.157
Foot on the brake.
Put it in drive.

09:39.370 --> 09:40.906
Give it a little gas.

09:43.374 --> 09:45.740
A little more.

09:46.961 --> 09:48.792
It's okay.

09:48.838 --> 09:50.294
Try again. Try again.

09:50.381 --> 09:52.667
Okay, don't stomp it.
Just push the pedal.

09:52.717 --> 09:53.877
Okay.

09:55.803 --> 09:58.465
There you go.
Now, look down the road,

09:58.514 --> 10:00.050
not right in front
of the bumper.

10:00.141 --> 10:01.756
- Right up there.
- Okay.

10:01.809 --> 10:03.800
Yeah, like that.
See?

10:03.811 --> 10:05.312
Yeah, like that.
See?

10:05.396 --> 10:07.182
You got it.

11:25.267 --> 11:27.223
I'm sorry.

11:28.813 --> 11:30.849
Don't be.

11:30.898 --> 11:32.684
You came after me.

11:32.733 --> 11:34.644
Just don't run
again, okay?

12:04.849 --> 12:06.510
Hey, this is pretty easy.

12:06.600 --> 12:08.682
Yeah.

12:08.728 --> 12:10.810
You haven't
parallel parked yet.

12:10.855 --> 12:12.595
Three-point turn.

12:12.648 --> 12:14.058
Won't be any need
for that.

12:14.150 --> 12:17.062
- Well, someday.
- Dad.

12:17.153 --> 12:19.485
It'll come back
to the way it was.

12:19.572 --> 12:22.063
-They're working on it.
- They?

12:22.158 --> 12:24.365
Someone somewhere.

12:24.452 --> 12:26.659
Has to be.

12:26.704 --> 12:28.660
I don't believe
this is the end.

12:28.706 --> 12:31.493
I can't.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.165
I won't.

12:34.754 --> 12:35.994
Neither should you.

12:37.882 --> 12:40.498
We can get back
what we lost.

12:42.636 --> 12:44.627
Not everything.

12:53.147 --> 12:55.138
Aw, I thought we'd get
a little farther.

12:55.232 --> 12:57.188
We've been running
on fumes for a while.

12:57.276 --> 12:59.483
There.

12:59.570 --> 13:01.026
Off the road.

13:18.172 --> 13:20.208
Stay close.

13:20.299 --> 13:22.210
Stay warm.

13:36.524 --> 13:38.515
Remember camping in Big Bear?

13:38.526 --> 13:40.562
Remember camping in Big Bear?

13:40.653 --> 13:42.769
Or were you too young?

13:42.822 --> 13:45.108
Sure.

13:45.199 --> 13:47.440
S'mores.

13:47.535 --> 13:49.571
I wasn't too young.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.448
Yeah, fishing on the lake.

13:53.415 --> 13:55.246
Mom hated it.

13:57.294 --> 13:59.376
She suffered it.

13:59.463 --> 14:02.079
She knew how important
it was to us.

14:04.426 --> 14:06.883
- But she...
- Was a city girl.

14:06.929 --> 14:09.170
Yeah.

14:14.103 --> 14:15.934
Wonder how it is
in the mountains now.

14:18.566 --> 14:21.057
Fewer people.

14:21.151 --> 14:23.233
Less dead.

14:25.281 --> 14:27.112
You could hunt, fish.

14:27.199 --> 14:29.440
Yeah, could be safe,

14:29.535 --> 14:31.321
place like that.

14:40.087 --> 14:41.748
What are we doing, Dad?

14:43.299 --> 14:45.164
We'll manage.

14:45.259 --> 14:47.250
Surviving.
We're doing okay.

14:47.261 --> 14:48.296
Surviving.
We're doing okay.

14:49.597 --> 14:51.508
Where should we go?

14:51.599 --> 14:52.805
I don't know.

14:52.850 --> 14:54.636
Someplace with elevation

14:54.727 --> 14:56.934
where we can see
what's coming.

14:56.979 --> 14:59.095
Vantage point.

14:59.189 --> 15:00.929
A house, maybe.

15:00.983 --> 15:03.099
With a well, water.

15:04.737 --> 15:07.695
We could go
to the border, the river.

15:07.781 --> 15:09.772
Yeah, but people pressing in from both
sides is dangerous.

15:09.783 --> 15:12.069
Yeah, but people pressing in from both
sides is dangerous.

15:12.119 --> 15:14.110
- But water.
- That's why it's dangerous.

15:14.121 --> 15:15.236
- But water.
- That's why it's dangerous.

15:15.331 --> 15:18.118
Everyone needs it.
Everyone goes there to feed.

15:18.167 --> 15:20.374
Predators find prey.

15:20.461 --> 15:22.452
We'll find
something better.

15:22.463 --> 15:23.919
We'll find
something better.

15:23.964 --> 15:26.421
Might not be perfect,
but it'll be ours.

15:34.808 --> 15:36.764
And then what?

15:46.987 --> 15:49.148
We start over.

15:57.623 --> 15:59.830
Dad.

15:59.875 --> 16:01.911
Dad, Dad, they can see...
kill the fire.

16:01.961 --> 16:04.122
Someone's coming.
Someone's coming.

16:09.385 --> 16:10.841
Come on.

16:19.186 --> 16:20.892
Who are they?

16:20.938 --> 16:23.099
I stole from them
back in the town.

16:23.148 --> 16:25.525
I took their food.

16:25.609 --> 16:27.190
Chris, no.

16:29.071 --> 16:31.983
We're not gonna hurt you over
some refried beans, buddy.

16:33.367 --> 16:35.528
We're gonna set up
camp here,

16:35.619 --> 16:37.530
so why don't you
just come on out

16:37.621 --> 16:39.657
so we don't piss on you
in the dark?

16:43.794 --> 16:45.785
We're here,
my son and l.

16:45.796 --> 16:47.127
We're here,
my son and l.

16:47.172 --> 16:49.037
I believe we already
met your son, sir.

16:49.091 --> 16:51.082
He demonstrated
some major badassery earlier today.

16:51.093 --> 16:52.708
He demonstrated
some major badassery earlier today.

16:55.139 --> 16:57.926
Welcome to camp here.

16:57.975 --> 17:00.057
We're thankful.

17:00.102 --> 17:02.093
- Do you have any other food?
- No.

17:02.104 --> 17:03.264
- Do you have any other food?
- No.

17:03.355 --> 17:05.346
-Water?
- Down to dregs.

17:05.357 --> 17:07.268
-Water?
- Down to dregs.

17:10.404 --> 17:13.146
- Do you?
- Do | what?

17:13.198 --> 17:14.904
Have some food?

17:14.950 --> 17:17.783
Sure, some.

17:17.870 --> 17:19.826
We're doing okay.

17:19.913 --> 17:22.825
Saved your life.

17:22.916 --> 17:24.531
You owe me.

17:24.626 --> 17:26.617
You say you saved my life,
I say you stole my shit.

17:26.628 --> 17:28.835
You say you saved my life,
I say you stole my shit.

17:28.922 --> 17:30.913
Do you want to debate
or do you want to eat?

17:30.924 --> 17:32.209
Do you want to debate
or do you want to eat?

17:37.056 --> 17:39.047
I'm Brandon.

17:39.099 --> 17:42.011
This is Derek,
Baby James.

18:38.909 --> 18:40.024
Ofelia?

20:00.157 --> 20:02.318
Climb, child, climb.

20:07.706 --> 20:10.118
Take my hand.

20:10.167 --> 20:11.577
Take it.

20:30.812 --> 20:32.848
Where is he?
Where is he?!

20:43.575 --> 20:45.782
It's an early warning
system.

20:45.869 --> 20:47.985
You guys are surviving.

20:48.080 --> 20:49.866
Yeah, we're outdoorsy.

20:49.957 --> 20:51.663
Thank you.

20:51.750 --> 20:53.536
You guys are the first
Americans we've met

20:53.627 --> 20:55.583
since hell started
raining down.

20:55.671 --> 20:57.912
It's our patriotic duty.

20:58.006 --> 20:59.871
No, eat 'em up.

20:59.967 --> 21:02.208
Just glad I don't have to sleep
in the tent with you.

21:05.597 --> 21:07.258
How'd you guys
get down here?

21:07.307 --> 21:09.889
Camping on
the Sea of Cortez,

21:09.977 --> 21:12.810
partying when shit
hit the fan.

21:12.896 --> 21:15.057
Been trying to get
home ever since.

21:16.149 --> 21:18.276
Where's home?

21:18.318 --> 21:19.933
San Diego.

21:27.452 --> 21:28.703
Tell me.

21:28.787 --> 21:30.698
Well, we came
from the north.

21:32.457 --> 21:34.869
LA's gone.

21:34.960 --> 21:37.076
San Diego's gone.

21:39.298 --> 21:41.084
You saw it?

21:41.174 --> 21:43.165
Saw it burning
on the way down here.

21:43.176 --> 21:44.712
Saw it burning
on the way down here.

21:46.513 --> 21:48.504
Military bombed those cities
trying to contain it.

21:48.515 --> 21:50.221
Military bombed those cities
trying to contain it.

21:50.267 --> 21:53.009
Everything's destroyed all the way
to the Continental Divide.

21:56.273 --> 21:58.229
That's what we know.

22:06.742 --> 22:08.733
Yeah, well,
we'll come back.

22:08.744 --> 22:10.325
Yeah, well,
we'll come back.

22:10.370 --> 22:12.156
We always do.

22:21.214 --> 22:23.205
Back at that taco stand, you showed
some skill taking out the wasted.

22:23.216 --> 22:24.547
Back at that taco stand, you showed
some skill taking out the wasted.

22:24.593 --> 22:27.300
- Wasted?
- Yeah, the first one we saw,

22:27.346 --> 22:29.428
we thought it was a guy
who had too many.

22:29.473 --> 22:31.338
You know,
he was stumbling.

22:31.391 --> 22:33.382
Till he took out
one of our bros.

22:34.686 --> 22:36.517
Never making
that mistake again.

22:39.649 --> 22:41.640
Where'd you learn to kill?
Your pops?

22:41.651 --> 22:42.902
Where'd you learn to kill?
Your pops?

22:42.986 --> 22:45.398
Itjust came to him

22:45.447 --> 22:47.733
like it comes
to all of us.

22:47.824 --> 22:49.109
Necessity.

22:50.702 --> 22:53.409
I don't count.

22:53.455 --> 22:55.741
Killer Chris?

22:58.668 --> 22:59.999
17.

23:01.505 --> 23:02.870
Damn, son.

23:02.964 --> 23:04.374
That's a healthy number.

23:04.424 --> 23:05.880
Gets easier
with practice.

23:05.967 --> 23:08.424
We try to avoid them
as much as we can.

23:08.470 --> 23:10.461
Look, we appreciate
the food,

23:10.472 --> 23:11.757
Look, we appreciate
the food,

23:11.848 --> 23:14.305
but we'll be
out of your hair by the morning.

23:14.351 --> 23:16.262
I mean,
we're so close to home,

23:16.311 --> 23:19.018
you guys want to hitch
a ride with us?

23:19.106 --> 23:21.472
We could use a couple
more guys like you.

23:21.525 --> 23:23.516
Thank you, but...
it's kind, it is.

23:23.527 --> 23:24.937
Thank you, but...
it's kind, it is.

23:25.028 --> 23:27.019
We're gonna carve something out
for ourselves here.

23:27.030 --> 23:28.315
We're gonna carve something out
for ourselves here.

23:28.365 --> 23:30.401
What are you gonna
carve into, buddy?

23:30.450 --> 23:32.441
We could use some gas
if you can spare it.

23:32.452 --> 23:33.612
We could use some gas
if you can spare it.

23:33.662 --> 23:35.653
See, that we...
we cannot do.

23:35.664 --> 23:37.120
See, that we...
we cannot do.

23:37.207 --> 23:38.868
Too short supply.

23:38.959 --> 23:41.291
But we can give you
a ride if you want.

23:41.336 --> 23:43.418
We can get you
to the next town.

23:54.433 --> 23:56.515
You put the signs
on the doors.

24:01.982 --> 24:04.849
You moved the infected
onto the floor.

24:04.943 --> 24:07.480
Yes, | contained
the problem.

24:07.529 --> 24:08.860
What was the problem?

24:08.947 --> 24:11.063
You.
You were.

24:11.158 --> 24:13.774
I moved the dead
to protect myself from all of you.

24:13.869 --> 24:15.780
I don't know what
you're talking about.

24:15.871 --> 24:17.611
- Where are they hiding?
- Away with this!

24:17.664 --> 24:19.996
- Where is who hiding?
- Where are they keeping Hector?

24:20.083 --> 24:22.825
I don't know who Hector is.
I don't know who they are.

24:22.919 --> 24:24.910
I came with three people...
my mom, two friends.

24:24.921 --> 24:26.661
I came with three people...
my mom, two friends.

24:26.715 --> 24:28.751
Have you seen them?

24:28.842 --> 24:30.582
I saw you,
justyou.

24:35.557 --> 24:38.515
I need to get
downstairs.

24:38.560 --> 24:40.846
My mother was surrounded
by infected.

24:40.937 --> 24:43.474
The dead are in the stainrvells.
You cannot go down.

24:43.523 --> 24:45.935
Okay, but you can
move them, right?

24:46.026 --> 24:48.438
With Hector.
| unlock one hall,

24:48.487 --> 24:50.694
I draw them inside,
lock them in.

24:50.780 --> 24:52.111
It is our defense.

24:52.199 --> 24:53.564
Well, you can do that.

24:53.617 --> 24:56.529
- It's not that simple.
- It is that simple.

24:56.578 --> 24:59.536
My mother needs me.

24:59.581 --> 25:01.822
Look, I have to go.

25:03.502 --> 25:06.164
Did you hear me?
I'm not here to hurt you.

25:13.512 --> 25:15.594
Who's Hector?

25:16.598 --> 25:19.385
He's my nephew.

25:19.434 --> 25:22.050
He went to find food
and never came back.

25:23.772 --> 25:25.763
The guests took him
to draw me out.

25:25.774 --> 25:27.014
The guests took him
to draw me out.

25:27.108 --> 25:28.894
I... I don't understand.

25:28.985 --> 25:31.476
I have keys to every hall,
every building.

25:31.530 --> 25:33.862
This place is a maze
and I know how to run it.

25:33.949 --> 25:36.281
Whoever has the keys
can control the hotel.

25:38.954 --> 25:40.569
Give them the keys.

25:40.622 --> 25:42.738
No, they'd kill us
or exile us.

25:42.791 --> 25:44.327
Either way,
it's the way.

25:44.417 --> 25:47.409
Gohome.
Leave.

25:47.462 --> 25:48.918
The hotel is home.

25:49.005 --> 25:51.496
It has been
for a long time.

25:51.550 --> 25:53.962
How many guests
are left?

25:55.845 --> 25:57.676
A dozen maybe.

25:57.722 --> 25:59.383
Perhaps less now.

26:01.518 --> 26:04.260
Help me find
my family.

26:04.354 --> 26:06.345
That'll make five of us.
Six when we find your nephew.

26:06.356 --> 26:08.142
That'll make five of us.
Six when we find your nephew.

26:08.233 --> 26:10.098
With the shit
my family's been through,

26:10.193 --> 26:12.775
six of us
is equal to a dozen.

26:12.821 --> 26:14.607
We can defend each other.

26:14.656 --> 26:16.317
Trust me.

26:20.328 --> 26:22.910
We do that
or we die up here.

26:25.500 --> 26:27.536
Dad, we should
go with them.

26:27.586 --> 26:30.077
No, we shouldn't.

26:30.171 --> 26:32.753
Don't know them,
don't trust them.

26:32.799 --> 26:34.790
You trust their
medical supplies.

26:34.843 --> 26:36.925
I trust the supplies,
not the source.

26:37.012 --> 26:39.879
- They helped us, Dad.
- Chris.

26:39.973 --> 26:41.964
- They like us.
- We have a plan.

26:41.975 --> 26:43.090
- They like us.
- We have a plan.

26:43.184 --> 26:45.345
We didn't know
home was an option.

26:46.771 --> 26:48.887
There is no home.

26:48.982 --> 26:50.722
You saw what happened
to San Diego.

26:50.775 --> 26:52.561
You said it would turn back.
You said that.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.147
- I know.
- You believe it.

26:54.237 --> 26:56.353
It hasn't happened yet.

26:56.448 --> 26:58.439
We have wide... open spaces here.
We have enough.

26:58.450 --> 26:59.565
We have wide... open spaces here.
We have enough.

26:59.618 --> 27:02.280
And they have more supplies, Dad,
and they're willing to share with us.

27:02.370 --> 27:04.076
How do you think
that happened, huh?

27:04.164 --> 27:05.654
How do you think
they have so much?

27:09.336 --> 27:11.292
Even after I've stolen from them,
they want to share.

27:11.379 --> 27:12.835
And they're willing to.

27:12.922 --> 27:15.584
I'm not gonna put
ourselves in their debt.

27:15.634 --> 27:17.625
They're good people.
They're strong people.

27:17.636 --> 27:18.842
They're good people.
They're strong people.

27:18.928 --> 27:20.839
They're not our people.

27:23.475 --> 27:25.431
It's Madison.

27:25.518 --> 27:27.554
Chris.

27:27.604 --> 27:30.311
You don't want to stray too far
so that way, you can go back.

27:32.609 --> 27:35.066
I want
to take care of you.

27:35.153 --> 27:37.519
What does that even mean?

27:37.572 --> 27:39.563
You want to just walk around till you think
they've gotten over it,

27:39.574 --> 27:41.075
You want to just walk around till you think
they've gotten over it,

27:41.159 --> 27:43.070
then crawl back?

27:44.621 --> 27:46.532
We survive together.
That's how...

27:46.581 --> 27:49.368
They're surviving.
They know how to survive.

27:49.459 --> 27:51.290
They're doing it.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.457
I think they're dangerous.

27:57.258 --> 27:59.044
Maybe that's what it takes.

28:00.845 --> 28:02.836
Look, Chris, we're gonna
go with them until morning

28:02.847 --> 28:04.098
Look, Chris, we're gonna
go with them until morning

28:04.182 --> 28:06.889
to the next town
and then we're on our own.

28:06.976 --> 28:09.888
We'll find another car.
We'll find a place.

28:09.979 --> 28:11.970
And that's the end of it.
Get some sleep.

28:11.981 --> 28:13.141
And that's the end of it.
Get some sleep.

28:52.772 --> 28:54.057
Elena!

28:56.151 --> 28:57.561
Elena, run.

29:09.831 --> 29:11.662
Right here, come on.

29:17.881 --> 29:19.746
Hey, this way.

29:56.628 --> 29:57.743
Elena!

30:04.260 --> 30:05.420
Elena!

30:05.512 --> 30:07.423
Take it.

30:14.729 --> 30:16.720
Come on.

30:16.773 --> 30:17.933
Come on, Alicia.

30:37.961 --> 30:39.747
What the hell
took you so long?

30:39.796 --> 30:41.377
I had to make sure
they were all clear

30:41.464 --> 30:43.375
so you can get
downstairs.

30:43.466 --> 30:45.297
You're coming with me.

30:45.385 --> 30:47.341
You're my guide.

30:49.639 --> 30:52.346
I haven't left the tower
since it began.

30:52.433 --> 30:54.424
Look, Hector needs you.

30:54.435 --> 30:55.720
Look, Hector needs you.

30:55.770 --> 30:57.385
My mother needs me.

30:57.480 --> 30:59.812
Would she have you
risk your life for hers?

31:04.696 --> 31:05.401
No...

31:05.947 --> 31:08.188
but she would
do it for me.

31:09.993 --> 31:12.029
My mother
would die for me.

31:39.939 --> 31:41.850
Let's go.

31:46.195 --> 31:47.651
Elena.

31:53.328 --> 31:55.910
Did they do this?
The guests?

31:57.457 --> 31:59.322
The father of the bride.

31:59.417 --> 32:02.375
He had a heart attack
on this spot.

32:04.839 --> 32:06.625
The poor man
became one of them

32:06.716 --> 32:09.207
while we were
waiting for rescue.

32:09.302 --> 32:12.169
He attacked
his own daughter, the bride...

32:13.973 --> 32:15.258
while her mother watched.

32:15.350 --> 32:17.136
What did you do?

32:19.270 --> 32:21.261
They looked up
to me for help.

32:21.272 --> 32:22.307
They looked up
to me for help.

32:22.398 --> 32:24.514
l contained the situation.

32:26.486 --> 32:28.192
l have the hotel
to think about.

32:28.279 --> 32:30.019
We were at capacity.

32:30.073 --> 32:32.906
All my guests,
it was a sickness.

32:32.951 --> 32:35.909
I couldn't let it spread.

32:41.459 --> 32:43.324
I locked them in...

32:55.515 --> 32:57.471
Hector and l...

33:00.561 --> 33:02.267
till help could come.

33:04.899 --> 33:07.390
It never did.

33:07.485 --> 33:09.567
There was no one
there to save us.

33:13.241 --> 33:14.947
People die.

33:16.828 --> 33:18.864
Now they hate me.

33:27.130 --> 33:28.666
I've seen worse.

33:29.757 --> 33:31.338
We've done worse.

33:33.720 --> 33:36.211
I won't let them
touch you.

33:36.264 --> 33:38.425
I promise.

33:44.272 --> 33:45.728
Come on.

33:56.159 --> 33:58.525
- No, no, I don't believe it.
- Yes. Yes.

33:58.619 --> 34:00.405
No, James is
blackout drunk, right.

34:00.496 --> 34:02.407
He comes staggering
out of the room.

34:02.498 --> 34:04.489
He's grinning, but he's got lipstick
smeared all over his face.

34:04.500 --> 34:05.831
He's grinning, but he's got lipstick
smeared all over his face.

34:05.918 --> 34:07.749
That's not the only place
I had lipstick, first of all.

34:07.837 --> 34:09.953
Oh, okay, then you're
a contortionist, bro,

34:10.006 --> 34:11.291
because you were
in there alone.

34:11.382 --> 34:12.838
- He was alone in there?
-He was alone.

34:12.925 --> 34:14.256
She climbed out
the window, man.

34:14.302 --> 34:16.167
- Big Betsy D'Angelo?
- Yeah.

34:16.220 --> 34:18.176
She's not climbing out
of any tiny window, bro.

34:18.222 --> 34:20.508
You're suspect.
She's a fat-bottomed girl.

34:20.600 --> 34:22.591
- No. - It's more cushion
for the pushin', okay?

34:22.602 --> 34:23.717
- No. - It's more cushion
for the pushin', okay?

34:23.811 --> 34:26.268
You're not having fun.

34:26.314 --> 34:28.600
No, not exactly.

34:28.691 --> 34:30.682
Oh, but this,
this is awesome.

34:30.693 --> 34:32.103
Oh, but this,
this is awesome.

34:32.153 --> 34:34.235
Not the word I'd use.

34:34.280 --> 34:37.113
We got no speed limits,
no cops,

34:37.158 --> 34:39.149
no money, no work,
no bills, no bullshit.

34:39.160 --> 34:40.275
no money, no work,
no bills, no bullshit.

34:40.369 --> 34:43.031
-We're just living.
- This isn't living.

34:43.081 --> 34:45.538
Are you kidding?
This is more than living, man.

34:45.625 --> 34:47.786
This is supernatural.

34:47.877 --> 34:50.334
We were nothing before this, man.
We were less than.

34:50.421 --> 34:52.412
But now the end times
made us gods.

34:52.423 --> 34:54.960
But now the end times
made us gods.

34:58.179 --> 35:00.886
Hey.
Hey, slow down, man.

35:00.973 --> 35:03.350
There's something up there.

35:03.434 --> 35:05.811
Might be some crops
up on the hill, maybe a farm.

35:05.895 --> 35:07.886
Oh, good catch, brother.
Nice.

35:07.897 --> 35:09.103
Oh, good catch, brother.
Nice.

35:10.441 --> 35:13.183
Dad, there's a farm
up there.

35:20.159 --> 35:22.775
- Did you find anything?
- Cupboards are bare.

35:22.870 --> 35:24.531
Dust.

35:24.622 --> 35:26.533
Bunch of dead
stuffed animals.

35:26.624 --> 35:28.990
Yeah, trailers are empty.

35:29.043 --> 35:31.876
Baby James, tell me
they got weed growing in those fields.

35:31.963 --> 35:34.500
There is a hand pump out back.
It's well water, though.

35:34.590 --> 35:37.502
Montezuma's revenge, bro.
No, thank you.

35:39.220 --> 35:40.835
All right,
let's check the barn.

35:42.473 --> 35:43.588
What?

35:43.683 --> 35:45.639
Here.
We could stay here.

35:45.726 --> 35:48.263
- Look at the place.
- Dad.

35:48.312 --> 35:51.270
Come on,
we got crops, water.

35:51.315 --> 35:53.021
It's away from the road.

35:53.067 --> 35:55.274
The place is isolated.

35:55.319 --> 35:57.105
I don't want
to stay here.

35:57.155 --> 35:58.941
Once they leave,
we stay.

35:59.031 --> 36:00.487
Make this home.

36:03.035 --> 36:04.900
Chris, listen to me.

36:04.996 --> 36:07.533
We need a group, Dad.

36:07.623 --> 36:09.454
We need people.

36:09.542 --> 36:12.454
Okay?
We need a place with people.

36:13.588 --> 36:14.873
We had that.

36:14.964 --> 36:16.704
They look at me different.

36:18.843 --> 36:20.754
Let's just
check out the barn.

36:23.639 --> 36:25.175
Come on.

36:27.143 --> 36:29.475
Hey, wait up.

36:34.525 --> 36:36.641
Killer Chris.

36:38.237 --> 36:40.068
There's something
in there.

36:42.700 --> 36:45.032
- What, are you scared, bro?
- Shut up.

36:52.043 --> 36:54.910
Protein, bro.

36:55.004 --> 36:57.837
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come here.

36:57.924 --> 36:59.630
That one, Brandon.
Get the fat one.

37:02.345 --> 37:04.461
Come on, come on.

37:12.688 --> 37:14.349
You suck.

37:33.668 --> 37:35.533
Yo, get the fat one,
not the small one.

38:01.821 --> 38:03.812
- Mom?
- Alicia, you must be quiet.

38:03.823 --> 38:05.939
- Mom?
- Alicia, you must be quiet.

38:06.033 --> 38:08.410
She was inside here.
Elena, she was inside here.

38:08.452 --> 38:10.283
- If she was trapped in there, she's dead.
- She's not dead!

38:10.329 --> 38:12.194
Someone locked the doors.
Someone did this.

38:12.248 --> 38:13.988
Either it was your mother...
you cannot let out what is in there.

38:14.083 --> 38:16.324
- You cannot. You cannot.
- Mom!

38:16.377 --> 38:18.368
- Mom!
- Stop that.

38:20.840 --> 38:23.172
Where is she?
Where are they?

38:23.217 --> 38:25.003
Where's my mother?

38:25.094 --> 38:26.709
Don't know what
you're talking about.

38:26.804 --> 38:29.045
I came here
with three people.

38:29.140 --> 38:31.176
- Have you seen anyone else?
- The keys.

38:31.225 --> 38:32.806
Don't give him the keys
until we know.

38:32.893 --> 38:35.851
Elena: We know.
She's not with them.

38:35.938 --> 38:38.315
She's gone.

38:47.616 --> 38:49.607
No, my mother's not dead.
She's not. She's alive.

38:49.618 --> 38:50.994
No, my mother's not dead.
She's not. She's alive.

38:51.078 --> 38:53.330
Look for her outside.
I don't care.

38:53.372 --> 38:56.205
Give me the keys,
I give you your nephew.

38:56.250 --> 38:58.366
And then you leave
this place.

38:58.419 --> 39:00.410
The keys.

39:00.463 --> 39:02.795
You can't send us out there.
We'll die out there.

39:02.882 --> 39:05.339
This monster
doesn't deserve to live.

39:05.384 --> 39:07.375
I want her dead
like my daughter, my husband.

39:07.386 --> 39:08.922
I want her dead
like my daughter, my husband.

39:09.013 --> 39:10.753
Ilene.

39:13.017 --> 39:14.928
Give him the keys,
Elena.

39:24.028 --> 39:25.859
Elena!

39:33.788 --> 39:35.528
There are three graves
out the back.

39:35.581 --> 39:37.367
Whoever buried them
is still here.

39:37.416 --> 39:39.657
Look, you're worried
about your boy. I get that.

39:39.752 --> 39:42.539
- Come on, Chris. - We'll keep him safe.
No harm will come to him.

39:42.588 --> 39:45.045
- Nice try, Rocky.
- Come on, Chris. Let's go.

39:45.132 --> 39:47.123
-|gotone!lgotone!
- Nice! Nice.

39:47.134 --> 39:48.419
-|gotone!lgotone!
- Nice! Nice.

39:49.053 --> 39:50.793
Hey! Get out!

39:51.013 --> 39:51.843
Now!

39:52.348 --> 39:55.090
This is my farm!
You're not allowed to be here!

39:55.434 --> 39:57.846
We don't speak Spanish.
Sorry.

39:57.937 --> 39:59.893
- This is his place. We have to leave.
- I don't think so.

39:59.980 --> 40:02.266
He lost his family.
They're buried here.

40:02.316 --> 40:03.897
- This is his home.
- Dad.

40:03.984 --> 40:06.942
We have no right, Chris.
We have no right.

40:10.616 --> 40:12.481
Mom?

40:24.213 --> 40:25.919
- Drop the gun.
- Por favor, put the gun away.

40:26.006 --> 40:27.746
You're outnumbered.
Drop the gun.

40:27.842 --> 40:29.833
- vamonos. We'll go.
- Get out or /'/I shoot!

40:29.844 --> 40:31.630
- vamonos. We'll go.
- Get out or /'/I shoot!

40:31.679 --> 40:34.091
- We'll go. Por favor.
- Don't make this hard.

40:55.202 --> 40:57.067
- I don 't speak...
- I'm sorry.

40:57.163 --> 40:58.369
Put the gun away.

40:59.790 --> 41:00.745
- Ah!
- Hey!

41:09.508 --> 41:11.339
This shouldn't
belocked.

41:27.610 --> 41:29.896
No!

41:34.825 --> 41:36.611
Help! Please!

41:36.660 --> 41:38.651
Open the door!

41:41.373 --> 41:42.909
Come on.

41:43.000 --> 41:45.412
- Here.
- Mom, are you okay?

41:45.461 --> 41:46.871
Yeah.
