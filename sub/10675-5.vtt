00:00.421 --> 00:02.833
♪♪

00:08.509 --> 00:10.341
Douglas, you're here.

00:10.341 --> 00:12.053
Guys, this is
our Uncle Douglas.

00:12.053 --> 00:14.475
Well, technically,
he's our father.

00:14.475 --> 00:16.057
Yeah. Like we'd ever
call him that.

00:17.728 --> 00:20.941
Oh. You're the guy
who tried to kill them.

00:20.941 --> 00:22.773
Nice to meet you.

00:22.773 --> 00:24.405
You, too, Oliver.

00:24.405 --> 00:27.858
You're not nearly as scrawny
as Chase said you were.

00:27.858 --> 00:30.571
That's because
I'm Oliver.

00:31.912 --> 00:34.745
Hi. I'm Skylar.

00:34.745 --> 00:37.158
Ah, the alien girl.

00:37.158 --> 00:38.919
I'm kind of disappointed.

00:38.919 --> 00:40.751
I thought you'd have
three heads.

00:40.751 --> 00:42.833
Don't be silly.

00:42.833 --> 00:45.166
You shed the other two
when you're a kid,

00:45.166 --> 00:47.168
and leave the money
under your pillow
for the head fairy.

00:47.168 --> 00:49.260
Uh, good news.

00:49.260 --> 00:51.342
Skylar just got
her powers back.

00:51.342 --> 00:54.555
And guess who got them
back for her.

00:54.555 --> 00:56.977
Okay, it was me.

00:58.099 --> 01:00.231
A little
Elite Force gossip.

01:00.231 --> 01:02.022
Scrawny is jelly
because Bookworm

01:02.022 --> 01:04.235
got Alien
her powers back.

01:05.646 --> 01:08.569
Okay, aliens
I can believe.

01:08.569 --> 01:10.781
But someone
jealous of Chase?

01:10.781 --> 01:12.453
Unfathomable.

01:14.245 --> 01:17.538
So looks like I'll be
staying here with you

01:17.538 --> 01:18.789
while my brother's gone.

01:18.789 --> 01:20.661
Where did
Mr. Davenport go?

01:20.661 --> 01:22.163
I mean, not that
I'm complaining.

01:22.163 --> 01:24.205
I think I speak for
all of us when I say

01:24.205 --> 01:26.797
we could use a break.

01:26.797 --> 01:28.629
He went back home.

01:28.629 --> 01:30.341
He'll be checking in,
but he wanted to be there

01:30.341 --> 01:31.802
with Tasha when
the baby arrives.

01:31.802 --> 01:34.305
Probably so he can jam
a bionic chip in its neck

01:34.305 --> 01:35.886
when she's not looking.

01:35.886 --> 01:38.849
Anyway, my first
order of business

01:38.849 --> 01:40.931
while I'm here is to
design the team's

01:40.931 --> 01:42.022
new mission suits.

01:42.022 --> 01:43.724
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

01:43.724 --> 01:46.147
No, you're not,
'cause I'm designing them.

01:46.147 --> 01:48.859
I started sketching up
a prototype two weeks ago.

01:48.859 --> 01:52.613
I think we can all agree
that the guy who created you

01:52.613 --> 01:55.035
is much more capable
of creating the mission suits.

01:55.035 --> 01:57.368
Yeah, 'cause Chase can't
be trusted with anything.

02:00.581 --> 02:04.084
I mean, I'd like to be
on Douglas' team, please.

02:08.048 --> 02:11.172
Chase is
the smartest guy in the world.

02:11.172 --> 02:16.056
And he did cure Skylar
all by himself.

02:16.056 --> 02:17.308
Thank you, Kaz.

02:17.308 --> 02:19.970
And I think we can also
all agree

02:19.970 --> 02:21.682
that our mission suits
shouldn't be designed by

02:21.682 --> 02:24.225
anyone who looks like
a hipster porcupine.

02:24.225 --> 02:25.856
Okay.

02:25.856 --> 02:28.028
I see how it is.

02:28.028 --> 02:30.531
I guess Oliver and I
will get to work on

02:30.531 --> 02:32.032
my version of the suit

02:32.032 --> 02:34.235
while you and Kaz
spin your wheels

02:34.235 --> 02:36.076
making something
we'll never use.

02:36.076 --> 02:38.619
- That's right, we will.
- Yeah, you will.

02:38.619 --> 02:40.911
Yeah, we will.

02:40.911 --> 02:43.284
Sorry, what are we
"willing"?

02:43.284 --> 02:46.086
We are gonna make
the most powerful,

02:46.086 --> 02:49.210
intimidating,
take no prisoners

02:49.210 --> 02:51.171
mission suits ever!

02:51.171 --> 02:52.883
It's dress-up time,

02:52.883 --> 02:54.885
and you just
became my doll.

03:43.554 --> 03:46.056
What are you doing?

03:46.056 --> 03:48.269
I want you to make
my mission suit breathable.

03:48.269 --> 03:51.061
I'm a wiggler.

03:51.061 --> 03:52.733
Well, stand still.

03:52.733 --> 03:55.155
These measurements
have to be exact.

03:55.155 --> 03:58.068
Ow! Careful.
Those pins are sharp.

03:58.068 --> 04:01.322
Would you relax?
I know what I'm doing.

04:01.322 --> 04:03.324
Ow!

04:03.324 --> 04:05.576
( evil giggle )
That one was all me.

04:06.577 --> 04:08.168
Stay away from me.

04:08.168 --> 04:10.541
- Stay away from me!
- Come on. Really?

04:10.541 --> 04:13.253
Skylar, I just
got a call

04:13.253 --> 04:15.135
from the head of
the biggest shoe company

04:15.135 --> 04:16.797
in the world,
and you're never gonna believe

04:16.797 --> 04:19.300
- what they offered me.
- Is it free shoes?

04:19.300 --> 04:23.594
I wonder if they have
anything for girls with 14 toes.

04:23.594 --> 04:26.146
You really have 14 toes?

04:26.146 --> 04:28.058
Duh. I'm an alien.

04:28.058 --> 04:29.730
Eight and six.

04:32.022 --> 04:34.945
All righty then.

04:34.945 --> 04:37.197
Anyway, they're giving me
my own sneaker line.

04:37.197 --> 04:39.860
They're gonna call them
Bree-zers.

04:39.860 --> 04:41.572
I don't get it.

04:41.572 --> 04:43.994
My name is Bree,

04:43.994 --> 04:45.826
and they just added
a "zers" at the end.

04:45.826 --> 04:47.408
No, I get the bad pun.

04:49.410 --> 04:51.752
I mean, why are they
giving you your own shoe?

04:51.752 --> 04:53.914
Because of my super speed.

04:53.914 --> 04:57.127
They're gonna put me in ads,
commercials, billboards.

04:57.127 --> 04:58.969
When you see Bree,
you'll think feet.

05:01.221 --> 05:03.424
So you're actually
gonna do it?

05:03.424 --> 05:05.426
I didn't think heroes
did stuff like that.

05:05.426 --> 05:07.057
Like what?

05:07.057 --> 05:09.730
You know, sell out.

05:09.730 --> 05:12.102
I'm not selling out.

05:12.102 --> 05:14.144
It's just nice
to be recognized

05:14.144 --> 05:15.606
for my unique ability.

05:15.606 --> 05:18.108
Well, I have
super speed, too,

05:18.108 --> 05:20.491
but I never needed
credit for it.

05:20.491 --> 05:22.242
I guess the gift
of saving people

05:22.242 --> 05:23.824
has always been
enough for me.

05:23.824 --> 05:25.906
But if this is something
you need,

05:25.906 --> 05:26.947
you go, girl.

05:28.369 --> 05:30.120
I don't need it.

05:30.120 --> 05:34.164
- Okay.
- I don't.

05:34.164 --> 05:37.167
Fine. I guess we'll just have
to agree to disagree.

05:37.167 --> 05:38.839
Yeah, I guess we will.

05:38.839 --> 05:39.880
Okay then, we will.

05:39.880 --> 05:41.051
Okay, Sally Sellout.

05:41.051 --> 05:42.843
Molly Martian Claw.

05:46.016 --> 05:49.269
Okay, Oliver, let's start
designing this suit.

05:49.269 --> 05:51.271
Cool. So here's
what I'm thinking.

05:51.271 --> 05:53.063
Oh. ( laughs )

05:53.063 --> 05:56.276
That's cute.

05:56.276 --> 05:57.978
What?

05:57.978 --> 05:59.900
I've been dreaming about
having my own superhero suit

05:59.900 --> 06:01.402
since I was a little kid.

06:01.402 --> 06:03.614
Now that I finally
have powers, this is my chance.

06:03.614 --> 06:05.536
Okay, fine.

06:05.536 --> 06:07.748
What did you
have in mind?

06:07.748 --> 06:09.249
Are you ready for this?

06:09.249 --> 06:11.121
Elbow swords.

06:11.121 --> 06:13.083
Swords that come out
of your elbows.

06:13.083 --> 06:16.667
Unlike that idea, which
came out of somewhere else.

06:16.667 --> 06:19.379
You're not seeing it.

06:19.379 --> 06:22.342
( fighting noises )
Elbow swords!

06:23.924 --> 06:25.886
No. With all
your super powers,

06:25.886 --> 06:28.138
you don't need gadgets.

06:28.138 --> 06:31.772
Just a simple,
functional suit.

06:33.514 --> 06:35.856
Guys, look.

06:35.856 --> 06:38.318
Chase tricked out my suit
with smoke jets.

06:38.318 --> 06:39.319
Why?

06:39.319 --> 06:41.111
For dramatic...

06:47.988 --> 06:49.530
Exits.

06:49.530 --> 06:52.202
That was so awesome!

06:52.202 --> 06:54.535
No, it wasn't.

06:54.535 --> 06:57.087
Oh, don't worry, Douglas.

06:57.087 --> 07:00.170
There's nothing wrong
with finishing second.

07:01.882 --> 07:06.216
I don't have any smoke jets,
so I'm just gonna leave.

07:12.553 --> 07:15.225
Oh, I can't believe you came
to support my commercial.

07:15.225 --> 07:18.148
I didn't.
I came here to
talk you out of it.

07:18.148 --> 07:20.651
Oh. Well, it's not
gonna work.

07:20.651 --> 07:24.154
Now step aside so everyone
can see my Bree-zers.

07:24.154 --> 07:26.236
Those are the ugliest shoes
I've ever seen.

07:26.236 --> 07:28.028
I know, but they're mine!

07:29.660 --> 07:32.162
There's our Bree.

07:32.162 --> 07:34.625
- Ready to shoot
your first commercial?
- I sure am.

07:34.625 --> 07:36.336
Great. Let's get you into
hair and makeup.

07:36.336 --> 07:38.208
I already went.

07:40.340 --> 07:42.713
Oh. Isn't this exciting?

07:42.713 --> 07:45.926
All these people are here
just to watch you run.

07:45.926 --> 07:48.348
And when they do, those shoes
are gonna fly right off
the shelves.

07:48.348 --> 07:51.011
And right into
the garbage.

07:51.011 --> 07:53.303
Excuse me, miss.
We're about to start shooting,

07:53.303 --> 07:55.185
so fans need to be on
that side of the camera.

07:55.185 --> 07:57.227
Oh, I'm not a fan.

07:57.227 --> 08:00.400
Oh. Are you the hair
and makeup lady?

08:00.400 --> 08:02.773
'Cause if so,
we need to talk.

08:07.277 --> 08:11.411
Did you see their faces
when your smoke jets went off?

08:11.411 --> 08:13.614
Actually, I haven't really
seen anything

08:13.614 --> 08:16.917
since my smoke jets
went off.

08:16.917 --> 08:19.079
Let's focus on
what's important.

08:19.079 --> 08:20.420
Beating Douglas.

08:20.420 --> 08:22.042
We already won the battle,

08:22.042 --> 08:24.294
now we just have
to win the war.

08:24.294 --> 08:27.047
Which means you need
something more.

08:27.047 --> 08:31.341
Laser-guided
ankle rockets!!

08:31.341 --> 08:35.596
I was really hoping you were
gonna say soothing eye drops.

08:39.479 --> 08:41.852
Okay, here's the plan.

08:41.852 --> 08:43.644
Take a quick 20-mile run
around the city,

08:43.644 --> 08:45.566
land back here on your mark.

08:45.566 --> 08:47.608
Most importantly, don't forget
to show us how much you love...

08:47.608 --> 08:50.821
- your Bree-zers.
- Yeah.

08:50.821 --> 08:52.613
- Got it.
- All right, people.

08:52.613 --> 08:54.414
Let's do this!

08:54.414 --> 08:56.456
And action.

08:56.456 --> 08:59.499
Time to take my Bree-zers
for a 20-mile run.

08:59.499 --> 09:01.922
Ready, set...

09:01.922 --> 09:04.334
And I'm back.

09:04.334 --> 09:07.167
Oh, by the way, it's raining
on the other side of town,

09:07.167 --> 09:08.929
which isn't a problem,
thanks to the great traction

09:08.929 --> 09:10.591
on my Bree-zers.

09:10.591 --> 09:13.764
Thank you.
Thank you.

09:15.135 --> 09:17.437
That was fantastic.
They love you!

09:17.437 --> 09:19.770
You're gonna sell
a ton of these things.
Keep going, keep going.

09:19.770 --> 09:21.521
No problem.
I'll do it again,

09:21.521 --> 09:23.894
but this time,
backwards.

09:23.894 --> 09:25.275
Yeah, okay.

09:47.507 --> 09:50.761
What just happened?

09:50.761 --> 09:52.552
Um, uh...
I don't know.

09:52.552 --> 09:53.844
I was running backwards
and must've tripped.

09:53.844 --> 09:55.515
Not you, the other girl.

09:55.515 --> 09:58.138
She came out of nowhere
and she saved that baby.

09:58.138 --> 10:00.931
She's a hero!

10:00.931 --> 10:02.853
No, no, no, no.

10:02.853 --> 10:05.105
Applause isn't necessary.
It's just what I do.

10:05.105 --> 10:08.438
Aw. And she's
so humble.

10:10.190 --> 10:12.442
I had no idea

10:12.442 --> 10:15.365
that there were two
bionic girls in Centium City.

10:15.365 --> 10:17.287
Of course I'm bionic.

10:17.287 --> 10:19.870
How else could I have done
that super awesome amazing thing

10:19.870 --> 10:21.411
I just did?

10:21.411 --> 10:24.244
Okay. Yay.
You saved a baby.

10:24.244 --> 10:26.086
Everyone's over it.
Back to me.

10:26.086 --> 10:28.548
My Bree-zers.

10:28.548 --> 10:31.511
- What's your name?
- Skylar.

10:31.511 --> 10:35.555
Well, Skylar, you just made
old Cocky McBackwards over here

10:35.555 --> 10:38.098
look like an amateur.

10:38.098 --> 10:39.930
You should be
in a commercial.

10:39.930 --> 10:41.682
- Me?
- Her?

10:41.682 --> 10:43.523
What do you say?
Wanna do it?

10:43.523 --> 10:45.565
- Absolutely.
- What?!

10:45.565 --> 10:47.357
Bring on the Skylars-ers.

10:47.357 --> 10:49.269
We'll work on that.

10:58.038 --> 11:00.330
No. What are you doing?

11:00.330 --> 11:01.872
No.

11:01.872 --> 11:04.374
Skylar, this was
my commercial.

11:04.374 --> 11:06.206
How could you
show me up like that?

11:06.206 --> 11:07.958
I wasn't trying to.

11:07.958 --> 11:09.379
You're the one
knocking over babies.

11:09.379 --> 11:11.712
Uh, I wasn't
knocking over babies.

11:11.712 --> 11:14.424
I was barreling into
a baby; there's a difference.

11:16.426 --> 11:18.218
I cannot believe you, Skylar.

11:18.218 --> 11:19.599
You are such a hypocrite.

11:19.599 --> 11:21.351
No, I'm not.

11:21.351 --> 11:23.974
I was just...
I mean, I was...

11:25.806 --> 11:27.898
You know what?
You're right.

11:27.898 --> 11:29.569
It's just,
my whole life,

11:29.569 --> 11:31.401
I've had to keep
my powers a secret,

11:31.401 --> 11:33.403
but now that I can
say I'm bionic,

11:33.403 --> 11:35.445
I can actually get credit.

11:35.445 --> 11:37.617
You called me out
for that.

11:37.617 --> 11:39.319
You said that I was
a sellout.

11:39.319 --> 11:41.491
Yeah, but now I get it.

11:41.491 --> 11:43.533
It is nice to be noticed.

11:43.533 --> 11:46.166
But it's not fair
to steal your spotlight.

11:46.166 --> 11:47.707
The commercial's
all yours.

11:47.707 --> 11:49.750
Thank you.

11:49.750 --> 11:52.462
All right, Skylar,
here is your contract.

11:52.462 --> 11:54.634
I see you've already
been to makeup.

11:54.634 --> 11:56.336
Actually, I haven't.

11:56.336 --> 11:58.548
Oh. A natural beauty.

11:58.548 --> 12:00.720
How refreshing.

12:03.103 --> 12:05.605
No, I haven't been there
because I decided

12:05.605 --> 12:07.808
not to do the commercial.

12:07.808 --> 12:09.689
Huh.

12:09.689 --> 12:12.062
Well, that is disappointing.

12:12.062 --> 12:14.564
Good news, Bree,
you're awesome again.
Put her poster back up.

12:14.564 --> 12:17.447
Thank you.

12:17.447 --> 12:20.070
I think it's only right you use
the fastest girl in the world.

12:21.491 --> 12:24.574
Wait. You think you're
faster than me?

12:24.574 --> 12:27.788
Of course not.
I know I'm faster than you.

12:27.788 --> 12:29.499
- Uh, no, you're not.
- Uh, yes, I am.

12:29.499 --> 12:32.632
( both arguing )

12:32.632 --> 12:34.925
Ladies, ladies.

12:34.925 --> 12:37.838
You know what?
I agree with Bree.

12:37.838 --> 12:40.510
The fastest girl should be
the face of the shoes.

12:40.510 --> 12:42.552
- Thank you.
- Which is why we're
gonna have a race.

12:42.552 --> 12:44.684
Wait, what?

12:44.684 --> 12:47.808
And whoever wins
will get the commercial,

12:47.808 --> 12:50.851
and be known as
the fastest girl in the world.

12:50.851 --> 12:53.653
- I'm in.
- Let's do it.

12:53.653 --> 12:56.656
Great! ( laughs )
I love this.

12:58.068 --> 13:00.400
After I win,

13:00.400 --> 13:01.701
the only thing
that you'll be known for

13:01.701 --> 13:02.702
is losing to me.

13:02.702 --> 13:04.744
Oh, yeah?
Well, after I win,

13:04.744 --> 13:06.706
the only thing
you'll be known for

13:06.706 --> 13:08.668
is rescuing a baby.

13:08.668 --> 13:10.911
Which is nice,
but it's no sneaker ad.

13:16.917 --> 13:21.471
Congratulations. You now
have elbow swords.

13:24.724 --> 13:26.516
This is so cool!

13:26.516 --> 13:29.559
Now I can fight off enemies
and make sushi at the same time.

13:31.561 --> 13:34.564
( cell phone beeping )

13:36.276 --> 13:37.357
It's Kaz.

13:37.357 --> 13:38.648
Ah! Look!

13:38.648 --> 13:41.151
They added laser-guided
ankle rockets.

13:41.151 --> 13:45.075
That is the stupidest
idea I have ever heard.

13:45.075 --> 13:46.656
But I'm not gonna lie.

13:46.656 --> 13:49.249
It kinda scares me.

13:49.249 --> 13:51.501
We can't lose to Chase.

13:51.501 --> 13:53.583
We are not gonna
lose to Chase,

13:53.583 --> 13:55.625
because we are about
to up our game.

13:55.625 --> 13:58.588
I need to change
the mechanics of the suit.

13:58.588 --> 14:00.720
- Are you double-jointed?
- No.

14:00.720 --> 14:02.512
Do you wanna be?

14:06.596 --> 14:09.599
- ( cell phone beeping )
- Look at this.

14:09.599 --> 14:12.682
Oliver and Douglas just added
toe cannons to their suit.

14:12.682 --> 14:14.774
That's genius.
We can't compete with that.

14:14.774 --> 14:17.687
Oh, yes, we can,

14:17.687 --> 14:20.030
'cause I'm gonna give you
propulsion trip wire.

14:20.030 --> 14:22.903
I have no idea what that is,
but I love it.

14:24.744 --> 14:26.156
Retractable bazooka.

14:26.156 --> 14:27.537
On it.

14:27.537 --> 14:29.579
Electrified net shooter.

14:29.579 --> 14:30.991
Check.

14:30.991 --> 14:32.752
Chainsaw gloves.

14:34.414 --> 14:36.586
Acid-blasting
toxic darts.

14:37.797 --> 14:40.921
Heat-seeking
wrist boomerangs.

14:40.921 --> 14:44.714
Strategically placed
thermonuclear
projectile buttons.

14:46.636 --> 14:48.718
Wait. I got it.

14:48.718 --> 14:51.431
Venomous snake launcher.

14:51.431 --> 14:54.104
Oh, Oliver.

14:54.104 --> 14:56.106
It's been done.

15:01.821 --> 15:04.734
Okay, are you guys ready
to see

15:04.734 --> 15:07.197
who's the fastest
girl in the world?

15:08.788 --> 15:10.700
When I say go,

15:10.700 --> 15:12.993
you guys will take
a super-speed loop

15:12.993 --> 15:14.624
around the city and end up
back here at the finish line.

15:14.624 --> 15:16.336
Look on
the bright side, Bree.

15:16.336 --> 15:18.918
At least when I beat you,
you'll have super strength

15:18.918 --> 15:20.630
and flying
to fall back on.

15:20.630 --> 15:21.962
Oh, wait.
That's me.

15:21.962 --> 15:24.594
Yeah, well,

15:24.594 --> 15:27.007
at least when I walk barefoot,
I don't make children cry.

15:27.007 --> 15:28.638
( gasps )

15:28.638 --> 15:32.262
Ladies, on your marks.

15:32.262 --> 15:34.814
Get set.

15:34.814 --> 15:37.317
Go!!

15:37.317 --> 15:40.190
And they're back.

15:40.190 --> 15:42.402
Yes, and I won.

15:42.402 --> 15:45.445
- No way. I won.
- ( both arguing )

15:45.445 --> 15:48.528
Ladies, ladies, ladies.
No need to argue.

15:48.528 --> 15:50.910
We can just
go to the tape.

15:50.910 --> 15:52.492
Tape?

15:55.165 --> 15:57.207
What tape?

15:57.207 --> 16:00.290
- Did you know
they were filming this?
- No, I did not.

16:00.290 --> 16:02.172
I set up high-tech cameras
at different spots

16:02.172 --> 16:04.714
around the park.

16:04.714 --> 16:06.756
We can slow the footage down
to one-ten thousandth

16:06.756 --> 16:08.848
of a second,
see who the winner is.

16:45.585 --> 16:48.968
Yay, I won.

16:51.091 --> 16:53.683
Where you going?

16:53.683 --> 16:55.475
Hey, no.
Hey, hey!

16:55.475 --> 16:57.477
Come back.
Come back!

16:57.477 --> 16:59.689
Hey, free shoes
for everyone!

16:59.689 --> 17:01.521
( laughs )
Great.

17:01.521 --> 17:04.314
Now I can't even
give these things away.

17:04.314 --> 17:06.776
I don't want either one of you
as my spokesperson.

17:06.776 --> 17:09.149
Nobody likes a cheater.

17:09.149 --> 17:10.780
At least, one that's
been caught.

17:14.784 --> 17:16.826
That went well.

17:16.826 --> 17:20.420
Skylar, look.

17:20.420 --> 17:23.463
I owe you
a really big apology.

17:23.463 --> 17:26.376
I was so afraid
of losing to you

17:26.376 --> 17:28.428
that I lost control
of myself.

17:28.428 --> 17:31.931
Hey, I'm just as guilty.
We both cheated.

17:31.931 --> 17:34.344
I guess when I saw you
save that baby,

17:34.344 --> 17:36.176
I just freaked out.

17:36.176 --> 17:37.937
I guess... I don't know.

17:37.937 --> 17:39.809
Super speed has always
been my thing.

17:39.809 --> 17:41.891
I get it.

17:41.891 --> 17:43.813
But for the record,
there's a lot more to you

17:43.813 --> 17:44.984
than just super speed.

17:44.984 --> 17:47.607
Thanks.

17:47.607 --> 17:51.151
And I'm sorry I said
mean things about
your alien feet.

17:51.151 --> 17:52.822
That's okay.

17:52.822 --> 17:54.824
I knew you were
just jealous.

17:54.824 --> 17:57.327
Yep, you got me.

18:02.792 --> 18:05.835
Wait till you see
Oliver's suit.

18:05.835 --> 18:07.207
It is fully loaded.

18:07.207 --> 18:10.260
I'm just gonna let my suit
do the talking,

18:10.260 --> 18:12.672
which, by the way,
it does.

18:14.013 --> 18:16.976
It's time for the big reveal.
You ready, Oliver?

18:16.976 --> 18:18.178
- Ready.
- Let's do it.

18:18.178 --> 18:20.680
Kaz.

18:20.680 --> 18:22.222
Kaz?

18:22.222 --> 18:24.063
Are you talking
to me?

18:24.063 --> 18:25.485
My ears are still
ringing

18:25.485 --> 18:26.896
from that last
missile test.

18:28.858 --> 18:30.230
Ha ha!

18:30.230 --> 18:32.532
Ha!

18:34.033 --> 18:35.695
What are you waiting for?
Get out here.

18:35.695 --> 18:37.697
I'm trying.

18:37.697 --> 18:39.829
Um, this thing's
a little heavy.

18:39.829 --> 18:42.242
Here. I'll help you.

18:47.167 --> 18:48.798
Step.

18:51.841 --> 18:54.804
Go ahead, Oliver.

18:54.804 --> 18:56.256
Show 'em what you got.

18:56.256 --> 18:59.098
Prepare to be wowed
by a retractable bazooka.

19:02.932 --> 19:04.894
Ow.

19:04.894 --> 19:09.148
I guess it extracted
before it retracted.

19:09.148 --> 19:11.771
What a disaster.

19:11.771 --> 19:15.235
Douglas, I think we may have
taken this a little too far.

19:15.235 --> 19:18.278
Yeah, these things are
way too impractical
for missions.

19:18.278 --> 19:21.491
These things are
totally mission-ready.

19:23.453 --> 19:25.875
Yeah, and to prove it,

19:25.875 --> 19:28.458
Kaz here is gonna use his suit
to take out that fly.

19:28.458 --> 19:31.000
No, Oliver's suit
will get the fly.

19:31.000 --> 19:32.001
Get it, Oliver.

19:32.001 --> 19:33.343
I can't feel my legs.

19:33.343 --> 19:35.755
Come on, Kaz.
Get the fly.

19:35.755 --> 19:37.597
Get the fly.
Go, go!

19:37.597 --> 19:41.601
( both yelling )

19:41.601 --> 19:44.103
Come on, Oliver.

19:44.103 --> 19:46.516
Do not help him!

19:47.647 --> 19:50.109
( all yelling at once )

19:50.109 --> 19:52.272
Elbow swords activate.

19:52.272 --> 19:55.865
DOUGLAS:
That's it. Yes!

19:55.865 --> 19:57.657
Come on, Oliver.
Come on now!

19:57.657 --> 20:00.740
( both yelling )

20:00.740 --> 20:01.951
It's over here.

20:01.951 --> 20:04.083
( yelling continues )

20:11.000 --> 20:12.382
I can't get up.

20:12.382 --> 20:15.465
I can, but
I don't want to.

20:15.465 --> 20:19.719
I guess it's back
to the drawing board.

20:19.719 --> 20:24.223
You know, we could
make 'em together.

20:26.145 --> 20:29.108
Yeah. It would be nice
to work with someone

20:29.108 --> 20:30.900
who speaks
the same language.

20:32.772 --> 20:35.315
Tell me about it.

20:35.315 --> 20:37.907
Amateur hour.

20:48.167 --> 20:51.000
Ow!

20:51.000 --> 20:53.673
What is this?

20:53.673 --> 20:55.635
Elbow sword.

20:59.138 --> 21:01.220
Guys, we did it.

21:01.220 --> 21:03.643
Douglas and I
put our heads together,

21:03.643 --> 21:05.765
and worked nonstop
over the past few days

21:05.765 --> 21:08.388
to create the team's
new mission suits,

21:08.388 --> 21:10.940
and they're better than
we could've ever imagined.

21:15.985 --> 21:19.068
Oh, yeah, we make this
look good.

21:22.452 --> 21:24.033
Hey, where's Douglas?

21:28.788 --> 21:30.500
Oh, I'm gonna
make this work.
