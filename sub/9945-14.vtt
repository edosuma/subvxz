Tickets this way

00:08.200 --> 00:12.637
Come and watch pikeys making a mess
of the lives they were given

00:12.720 --> 00:14.517
by him upstairs

00:14.600 --> 00:18.434
and kids they're convinced
aren't actually theirs.

00:18.520 --> 00:22.229
What sounds on earth
could ever replace

00:22.320 --> 00:23.435
kids needing money

00:23.520 --> 00:25.476
or wives in your face?

00:25.560 --> 00:27.949
Cos this, people reckon,
and me included,

00:28.040 --> 00:32.033
is why pubs and drugs
were kindly invented,

00:32.119 --> 00:34.634
to calm us all down

00:34.720 --> 00:36.995
and stop us going mental.

00:37.080 --> 00:41.517
These are Chatsworth Estate's
basic essentials.

00:41.600 --> 00:45.115
We are worth every penny
for grinding your axes.

00:45.200 --> 00:47.714
You shit on our heads,

00:47.800 --> 00:49.916
but you pay the taxes.

00:53.480 --> 00:56.517
Imagine a Britain without
Chatsworth buccaneers,

00:56.600 --> 00:59.034
who'd come on your face
for the price of a beer.

00:59.120 --> 01:01.554
Make poverty history,

01:01.640 --> 01:03.790
cheaper drugs now.

01:03.880 --> 01:06.155
Make poverty history,

01:06.240 --> 01:07.832
cheaper drugs now!

01:09.200 --> 01:10.713
Scatter!

01:10.800 --> 01:12.313

All right, no wisecracks, there's no time.

02:57.200 --> 03:00.397
I've done upstairs,
but there's still work to do.

03:00.480 --> 03:02.550
I want this place gleaming. Here,

03:02.640 --> 03:05.871
I need more disinfectant,
floor cleaner, kitchen rolls, bin bags

03:05.960 --> 03:10.750
and that stuff you shake on the carpet
to stop it smelling like a shit-hole.

03:10.840 --> 03:14.958
You do want Liam and Stella back,

03:16.920 --> 03:18.353
Come on, snap out of it.

Meena!

03:24.720 --> 03:28.429
Meena!
I pissed you off, you pissed me off.

03:28.520 --> 03:30.431
I'm your mother, you're my daughter.

03:30.520 --> 03:32.829
- I want you back home.
- Just like that?

03:32.920 --> 03:35.718
I don't think a whorehouse is the best
place for you to be, that's all.

03:35.800 --> 03:38.633
- Is that your way of saying sorry?
- Don't push your luck.

03:38.720 --> 03:41.109
I'll give you all the space you need.

03:41.200 --> 03:44.795
You say that now, but we'll be
back to square one within days.

03:44.880 --> 03:47.394
Why not save ourselves the bother
and stay as we are?

03:47.480 --> 03:48.799
Cos I miss you.

03:51.640 --> 03:53.278
Think about it.

04:05.560 --> 04:07.152
Got nothing to say to me?

04:07.240 --> 04:09.470
I was wondering where to start.

04:11.320 --> 04:13.038
It's been tough...

04:13.120 --> 04:15.509
doing what I had to do, but I did it.

04:15.600 --> 04:16.952
What do you want, a medal?

04:17.040 --> 04:19.474
- I want a bit of respect.
- What for?

04:19.560 --> 04:24.190
Filling your veins with shite
or fucking some scrubber behind my back?

04:24.280 --> 04:29.593
They'll be no more drugs. And should
you continue to distance yourself,

04:29.680 --> 04:32.558
I'll take that as my cue
to find my comforts elsewhere.

04:32.640 --> 04:35.359
You're in no position to make any
demands after what you've done.

04:35.440 --> 04:38.193
And you're in no position to tell me
how I can and can't live my life.

04:38.280 --> 04:41.397
- So where do we go from here?
- That's very much up to you.

04:41.480 --> 04:46.110
If you are going to be my wife,
stand by my side, that's fine.

04:46.200 --> 04:48.430
But if you think
you can rip my balls off

04:48.520 --> 04:51.273
and tell me what I can and can't do,
that isn't.

04:52.640 --> 04:53.834
Your call.

05:06.040 --> 05:08.031
Colin...

05:08.120 --> 05:10.076
If you're nervous, don't be.

05:10.160 --> 05:13.232
Whatever you requested,
we've heard it a thousand times before.

05:13.320 --> 05:15.311
- Eh, Kelly?
- Heard it, done it.

05:15.400 --> 05:17.914
So what is it,
a bit of slap and tickle? M and S?

05:18.000 --> 05:20.389
- Domination?
- Cross-dressing?

05:20.480 --> 05:22.755
Not you breast feeding,
then shit in a nappy, is it?

05:22.840 --> 05:24.637
Does it involve a glass table
and a number two?

05:26.560 --> 05:28.516
It's ball...

05:28.600 --> 05:30.238
room.

05:31.560 --> 05:34.074

UNZIPPING

05:48.360 --> 05:49.952
Fred and Ginger.

05:50.040 --> 05:52.315
So what? Shoes on, wig on?

05:52.400 --> 05:54.391
DVD on while we do the dirty?

05:57.840 --> 06:00.195
It's a bit more complicated
than that.

06:03.200 --> 06:06.397
Things'll change. I'll try.

06:06.480 --> 06:09.552
At least say you'll think about it.

06:09.640 --> 06:11.551
OK.

06:14.960 --> 06:16.313
Reckon she'll come round?

06:16.400 --> 06:18.914
She's as stubborn as I am,
so she's gonna make me suffer.

06:19.000 --> 06:20.319
But, yeah, she'll come round.

06:20.400 --> 06:23.358
Go get your glad rags on,
you've got a party to get to.

06:23.440 --> 06:25.670
- I can't leave you on your own.
- Early night for me.

06:25.760 --> 06:28.593
- Bath and bed. I'll lock up.
- You don't mind?

06:28.680 --> 06:30.830
I'll be glad to see the back of you.
Go on.

06:34.720 --> 06:36.631
PHONE RINGS

06:40.120 --> 06:41.269
Hello?

06:42.680 --> 06:44.113
Hello?

06:51.280 --> 06:53.191
Right, that's downstairs finished.

06:53.280 --> 06:55.032
- Bathroom next.
- It's done.

06:55.120 --> 06:57.156
- The skirtings'll need cleaning.
- Done.

06:57.240 --> 07:00.118
- Bedrooms.
- Done. I did say.

07:00.200 --> 07:01.394
But I'll just check.

07:01.480 --> 07:04.916
Look, you wanted me to do more,
I've done it, and you're still not happy.

07:05.000 --> 07:07.355
I just want to help.

07:07.440 --> 07:10.352
All the time, right,
I lumbered you with all this,

07:10.440 --> 07:13.716
it was wrong, and I apologise, right?

07:13.800 --> 07:17.076
But I know now,
it's my responsibility, not yours.

07:20.240 --> 07:23.437
- Right, so what do you want me to do?
- Eh? I don't know.

07:23.520 --> 07:25.078
Form a cult, squeeze your spots,

07:25.160 --> 07:27.276
do whatever teenagers
are supposed to do.

07:44.360 --> 07:45.554
Yvonne, it's me!

07:49.720 --> 07:51.995
- What the fuck is all this about?
- I needed to see you.

07:52.080 --> 07:53.229
You can't. You're dead.

07:53.320 --> 07:56.153
You have no idea what it's
been like for me since I left.

07:56.240 --> 07:59.755
And I've had it easy, me? Arranging
your funeral? Talking the kids round?

07:59.840 --> 08:02.991
Telling them Daddy loved them,
but he's safe in the arms of Allah

08:03.080 --> 08:04.957
and one day
we're all going to be reunited?

08:05.040 --> 08:07.110
Not realising it were gonna be
so fucking soon.

08:07.200 --> 08:08.189
I made a mistake!

08:08.280 --> 08:10.874
You made more than one, Kash.

08:10.960 --> 08:14.111
- Get out.
- I've thought about you every day.

08:15.240 --> 08:16.434
I've missed you.

08:16.520 --> 08:21.435
Look, it wasn't until I lost you
that I realised how much I wanted you.

08:22.400 --> 08:25.153
I can tell them I had an accident.
A breakdown.

08:25.240 --> 08:27.800
I lost my memory,
didn't know who I was.

08:27.880 --> 08:31.111
Hang on. What are you talking about?

08:31.200 --> 08:33.998
I want to be a father to our children.

08:35.760 --> 08:37.159
Husband to me wife.

08:38.840 --> 08:41.400
Take me back.

09:04.040 --> 09:06.349
H20, 100%.

09:15.920 --> 09:19.230
It's only one night, Dad. Just keep
thinking about Liam and Stella.

09:19.320 --> 09:21.754
We need them back home
where they belong. With us.

09:21.840 --> 09:24.070
The place isn't the same
without them.

09:24.160 --> 09:26.151
I'm glad I've not had a drink.

09:26.240 --> 09:27.912
I'm glad I'm clear-headed.

09:28.000 --> 09:29.592
- Yeah?
- Mmm.

09:30.840 --> 09:34.310
Might never have noticed what
a fine young man you've turned into.

09:39.120 --> 09:40.394
FRANK FARTS

09:42.360 --> 09:46.512
- What's that?
- Biriyani. What can I say?

09:54.440 --> 09:55.668
MUSIC STOPS

10:06.360 --> 10:07.429
Give us a minute.

10:09.440 --> 10:10.475
Move!

10:20.400 --> 10:21.913
Thanks for dropping the charges.

10:24.120 --> 10:26.918
Hang on. You did me a favour.

10:27.000 --> 10:29.639
You didn't give me one of
your fucking kidneys.

10:29.720 --> 10:33.315
Sorry. I always smile
when I'm nervous.

10:33.400 --> 10:36.153
I know what I did,
and I know it was wrong.

10:36.240 --> 10:38.834
But I give you my word,
it'll never happen again.

10:38.920 --> 10:40.273
I know.

10:40.360 --> 10:43.511
I love her. I can't imagine me
living without your daughter.

10:43.600 --> 10:46.637
- You're right there.
- I'll do whatever it takes.

10:58.680 --> 10:59.874
Drink?

11:05.000 --> 11:08.629
Whoa, spread 'em, Frank.
It's a drug-free zone from now on.

11:08.720 --> 11:11.075
All usual suspects to be frisked
at regular intervals.

11:11.160 --> 11:12.149
I'm going home!

11:12.240 --> 11:14.879
0h, can we just get on with it,
please?

11:14.960 --> 11:17.633
I don't want to touch you any more
than you want to be touched, OK?

11:17.720 --> 11:19.915
This is an infringement
of me human rights.

11:20.000 --> 11:22.594
That'd be true,
if you were half fucking human.

11:24.640 --> 11:27.632
It's prescription.
It's for when I get me bad heads.

11:27.720 --> 11:29.392
- Like now?
- No...

11:29.480 --> 11:30.356
Ohh!

11:30.440 --> 11:32.954
Consider that your
final warning, Frank.

11:34.600 --> 11:37.592
- Oh, I don't believe it!
- Pissed already?

11:37.680 --> 11:40.956
I'm not under the influence of anything.
How many more fucking times?

11:41.040 --> 11:43.554
For God's sake, Frank.

12:01.000 --> 12:04.151
- You wouldn't be money laundering?
- That's exactly what I'm doing.

12:05.400 --> 12:07.834
And 10% of it's ours.

12:11.120 --> 12:11.916
Since when?

12:12.000 --> 12:15.390
Since I renegotiated
my terms and conditions.

12:16.320 --> 12:20.598
And once we've got enough, we can
retire from the family business and...

12:20.680 --> 12:21.749
And what?

12:25.080 --> 12:27.435
Mum being inside,

12:27.520 --> 12:31.832
Dad going through, well,
what he's been through...

12:31.920 --> 12:35.196
kind of got me thinking
what I want from life.

12:35.280 --> 12:37.874
What's important to me and who.

12:37.960 --> 12:41.839
You know your family's important
to you. We've always known that.

12:41.920 --> 12:44.309
You know how hard
I've had to work to get that together?

12:44.400 --> 12:47.517
How many heads I've had to crack?
The risks I've taken?

12:47.600 --> 12:50.672
And I know Mam and Dad said
I could have a bigger piece of the pie,

12:50.760 --> 12:54.389
but I'm wondering...
why can't I have a pie of me own?

12:58.680 --> 13:00.352
Yes, lads?

13:18.920 --> 13:21.559
♪ She drives me crazy

13:24.440 --> 13:26.749
♪ Like no-one else

13:28.800 --> 13:30.392
♪ She drives me crazy

13:30.480 --> 13:33.199

13:34.480 --> 13:35.629
Dad.

13:36.760 --> 13:39.149
- Dad!
- Are you on something?

13:39.240 --> 13:41.629
- No such bleeding luck.
- Stay clean, please.

13:41.720 --> 13:43.790
I couldn't be any bleeding cleaner
if I tried.

13:43.880 --> 13:46.952
Don't let us down. We've got
the social round in the morning.

13:47.040 --> 13:49.713
Will you lot shut the fuck up?
I said I'll behave, OK?

13:49.800 --> 13:52.234
Everyone is under
strict instructions not to give you 'owt

13:52.320 --> 13:56.233
that falls within the categories
of Class A, B or C.

13:57.320 --> 13:59.993
D, E, F, G...

14:00.080 --> 14:02.833
Oh, I've had enough. I'm off.

14:02.920 --> 14:06.071
- Where?
- Home. Got to stay clean, haven't I?

14:06.160 --> 14:10.039
Sober. And like the three wise monkeys
keep on fucking saying,

14:10.120 --> 14:13.351
it's just one night.

14:24.320 --> 14:27.437
If you're doing this for me, then don't.

14:27.520 --> 14:30.990
Cos when it all turns to rat's piss,
I'll be the one getting the blame.

14:31.080 --> 14:32.274
It won't.

14:32.360 --> 14:34.237
We're all right with what we've got.

14:34.320 --> 14:37.039
We don't want...
We don't need any more.

14:37.120 --> 14:39.793
Yeah, for now. But what about later?

14:39.880 --> 14:42.633
What if we decide to have kids?

14:42.720 --> 14:44.392
Where did that come from?

14:44.480 --> 14:48.632
A couple of months back, if I'd have
asked you what your family was,

14:48.720 --> 14:52.838
you'd have said your mam, your dad,
Mandy, Shane and Mickey.

14:52.920 --> 14:54.512
I was just your wife.

14:54.600 --> 14:56.318
Kids weren't even part of the plan.

14:56.400 --> 14:58.789
A couple of months ago,
we nearly split.

14:58.880 --> 15:01.952
My dad was a junkie and Mam could
have been facing life for murder

15:02.040 --> 15:03.473
if that twat hadn't survived.

15:03.560 --> 15:07.838
All I'm saying is, I want more
for the effort I'm putting in.

15:07.920 --> 15:10.798
For you and me, for our future.

15:10.880 --> 15:13.155
I'm tired of carrying passengers, Karen.

15:13.240 --> 15:15.276
We've ran out of voddy.

15:15.360 --> 15:19.319
Mam says put it on slate.
See you later.

15:19.400 --> 15:22.790
Er, no, you won't. Karen and I
are having an early night.

15:22.880 --> 15:25.348
It's me mam's welcome home do!
You've got to be there.

15:25.440 --> 15:27.556
I don't got to be anywhere.

15:27.640 --> 15:29.995
Look, tell her I'll see her tomorrow.

15:33.720 --> 15:35.950
I'm not just a Maguire.

15:36.040 --> 15:39.077
I'm Jamie Maguire.
You're Karen Maguire.

15:40.680 --> 15:43.513
This... is my family.

15:46.280 --> 15:47.235
OK.

15:48.480 --> 15:52.155
Now, your arm here...
and my arm there.

15:52.240 --> 15:55.152
Now, take the weight on the balls...

15:57.080 --> 15:58.559
...of your feet.

16:02.120 --> 16:06.477
Something tells me you're going to
be good at this. Very, very good.

16:10.280 --> 16:12.794
Bit risky phoning.
Anybody could have picked up.

16:12.880 --> 16:14.950
I've been thinking
about you all night.

16:15.040 --> 16:19.352
I look back and I can't believe
what I did to you. To our kids.

16:19.440 --> 16:23.672
Look, years of tearing myself apart
about the way I treated you. Please!

16:23.760 --> 16:25.591
Give me a chance to put things right.

16:25.680 --> 16:27.989
Kash, you're dead.

16:28.080 --> 16:30.719
We can explain all that!

16:30.800 --> 16:32.995
Do you have any idea
what this'll do to the kids?

16:33.080 --> 16:35.469
They still think
you're floating down the Ganges.

16:35.560 --> 16:38.552
How do you think they'll react
when they realise you're still alive?

16:38.640 --> 16:42.713
And not only that, that you -
we - faked the whole thing?

16:42.800 --> 16:45.997
- They'll come round!
- Kash, please!

16:46.080 --> 16:47.559
I'm begging you.

16:47.640 --> 16:50.757
Have anything you want.
Just leave the kids out of it, please.

16:50.840 --> 16:53.274
I love you.

16:54.560 --> 16:56.437
I don't love you.

16:56.520 --> 17:00.433
And you coming back here
could fuck up everything I've got.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.397
The kids, Stan...

17:02.480 --> 17:04.277
Stan Waterman?

17:04.359 --> 17:06.351
He's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

17:06.440 --> 17:08.556
I've got no chance, have I?

17:10.760 --> 17:13.797
Three years too late. I'm sorry.

17:13.880 --> 17:16.234
I've moved on. We all have.

17:16.319 --> 17:18.117
So should you.

17:18.200 --> 17:22.512
Start a new life. Get married again,
if that's what you need to do.

17:22.599 --> 17:24.511
How am I supposed to do that?

17:24.599 --> 17:28.148
- I haven't got a penny to my name.
- I can help.

17:28.240 --> 17:31.312
I've got a couple of grand.
It'll leave me skint,

17:31.400 --> 17:34.437
but I should be used to that
by now, eh?

17:41.160 --> 17:42.388
Good night last night.

17:44.440 --> 17:46.158
Have to keep our eye on Joe.

17:46.240 --> 17:49.630
I think Joe knows if he ever laid
a hand on a child of ours again

17:49.720 --> 17:51.790
he'd never be able
to have any of his own.

17:51.880 --> 17:54.155
You've been to see him?

17:54.240 --> 17:56.595
We made our feelings known.

17:56.680 --> 17:58.875
- And why wasn't I told?
- You were in the nick.

17:58.960 --> 17:59.995
I got out yesterday afternoon.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.798
You weren't speaking to me
yesterday afternoon.

18:01.880 --> 18:05.919
I kept this business going
while you were on your lost weekend.

18:06.000 --> 18:08.673
I made sure we kept what was ours.

18:08.760 --> 18:10.830
I fought like you wouldn't believe
to make sure

18:10.920 --> 18:12.751
you hadn't fucked everything up,

18:12.840 --> 18:15.877
so don't you dare try and nudge me
out of what's mine...

18:15.960 --> 18:17.678
Here you go, with "me" and "mine".

18:17.760 --> 18:21.230
- I own 50% of everything we've got.
- I'm not arguing with that.

18:21.320 --> 18:26.110
All's I'm saying is, from now on,
there's one boss.

18:26.200 --> 18:27.394
Me.

18:28.480 --> 18:32.109
<i>We built this business. Me and you.</i>

18:32.200 --> 18:35.431
And if you think I'm going to
turn into some little Hausfrau

18:35.520 --> 18:40.992
just so you can shag your way
through your mid-life crisis...

18:41.080 --> 18:42.593
think again.

18:47.480 --> 18:49.471
♪ She drives me crazy... ♪

18:52.120 --> 18:54.873
We've been trying to rouse you
for half an hour.

18:54.960 --> 18:57.952
It's the first time I've slept properly
in about ten years.

18:58.040 --> 19:00.031
Are you sure you're not
under the influence?

19:00.120 --> 19:02.270
I was asleep by... 11.30.

19:02.360 --> 19:05.557
I said I'd take nothing
and I took nothing.

19:05.640 --> 19:08.871
I had nowt but water at Eva Braun's
welcome home. Hand on heart.

19:10.600 --> 19:12.431
Test me piss, if you like.

19:12.520 --> 19:14.351
I want me kids back!

19:15.920 --> 19:17.592
Nice one, Dad.

19:23.800 --> 19:25.279
HE YAWNS

19:25.360 --> 19:28.716
I'd forgotten what it feels like
to have blood flowing through me veins

19:28.800 --> 19:31.792
- instead of 5% imported lager.
- Why don't you get yourself ready?

19:31.880 --> 19:34.440
Shirt's ironed, on the back
of your bedroom door.

19:48.680 --> 19:51.433
HE EXHALES

19:51.520 --> 19:53.033
God, I feel alive!

19:53.120 --> 19:55.031
- Where have you been?
- Out.

19:55.120 --> 19:58.032
You've been hours. I was worried.
Your mobile went straight to voicemail.

19:58.120 --> 20:02.796
Stan, will you back off?
You're suffocating me!

20:02.880 --> 20:05.917
You can be a little overbearing
at times.

20:06.000 --> 20:07.558
Fuck... off!

20:15.320 --> 20:16.673
What's going on?

20:26.600 --> 20:30.354
I've come to apologise.
I'm doing this for Mandy.

20:30.440 --> 20:32.954
I love her,
and we want to make a go of it.

20:33.040 --> 20:34.792
She needs her family.

20:34.880 --> 20:37.110
She's got her family.

20:38.360 --> 20:40.794
Karen?
See what this bloke wants, will you?

20:47.560 --> 20:51.314
I thought you might have a smile for me,
after everything we've been through.

20:51.400 --> 20:52.469
Don't push your luck.

20:52.560 --> 20:55.028
- Imagine what Jamie'd do if he knew.
- Well, he'd kill you.

20:55.120 --> 20:58.351
Well, he'd have to be quick.
Cos if he thinks I'm going to let him

20:58.440 --> 21:01.955
have a pop at me twice, he's more thick
than I had him marked down for.

21:02.040 --> 21:04.952
Three lagers, pint of Guinness,

21:05.040 --> 21:07.349
orange and ice...

21:07.440 --> 21:10.432
a voddy tonic for Laughing Gas.

21:10.520 --> 21:13.273
I want you to build some bridges.

21:13.360 --> 21:16.591
Between me and your hubby.
Convince him that I mean what I say,

21:16.680 --> 21:19.990
that I'm head over heels for his sister
and that I'm a changed man.

21:20.080 --> 21:22.150
That he actually beat
some sense into me.

21:22.240 --> 21:24.117
You're wasting your time.

21:24.200 --> 21:25.553
Try.

21:25.640 --> 21:27.870
And remember,

21:27.960 --> 21:31.873
I can walk away from this
at any time I like. You can't.

21:31.960 --> 21:35.236
No, but you're presuming I want to.
Or that I need to.

21:35.320 --> 21:37.914
You tell Jamie what went on
between me and you.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.150
Just see who he believes.

21:40.240 --> 21:43.038
His wife, who he wants to have his kids,

21:43.120 --> 21:47.113
or the piece of shit
that near bust his sister's ribs.

21:47.200 --> 21:50.033
That's L8, please, Joe.

21:51.840 --> 21:53.319
Take one for yourself.

21:53.400 --> 21:54.674
No, thanks.

21:55.920 --> 21:59.390
As you know, I have to submit
a report to my superiors

21:59.480 --> 22:04.395
about the possibility of Stella
and Liam's return to the family home.

22:04.480 --> 22:07.870
Can we read it first? Make sure
you're not putting any lies down.

22:07.960 --> 22:10.428
- Debbie...
- Well, she's not trustworthy, is she?

22:10.520 --> 22:12.431
Made mates with us last time,

22:12.520 --> 22:14.590
pissed off with the kids
as soon as our back was turned.

22:14.680 --> 22:16.716
- That's enough.
- It's not like you're not thinking it.

22:16.800 --> 22:18.597
This isn't helping, Debbie.

22:21.720 --> 22:25.315
I did what I had to do.
We will not leave children in a home

22:25.400 --> 22:27.834
where there are drugs
or alcohol being abused.

22:27.920 --> 22:29.831
All that's over. It's different.

22:29.920 --> 22:33.151
I've changed, seen the light.

22:33.240 --> 22:35.993
You know you hear about
people saying that

22:36.080 --> 22:39.550
they'd die for their sons and daughters,
leap in front of bullets for them?

22:39.640 --> 22:42.950
I used to think, "Bollocks.
You can always have more kids."

22:43.960 --> 22:45.313
But...

22:45.400 --> 22:47.197
I understand now.

22:47.280 --> 22:50.238
I mean, losing Liam and Stella,

22:50.320 --> 22:56.156
it's made me reassess
what I want out of life.

22:56.240 --> 22:58.151
And what I want...

22:58.240 --> 23:00.151
first and foremost...

23:00.240 --> 23:03.038
is my kids back.

23:04.160 --> 23:07.914
- So what is it we need to do?
- Well, what we're looking for initially

23:08.000 --> 23:12.232
is an improvement
re certain safety issues.

23:12.320 --> 23:16.393
But I can see that there has been
a huge advance in that regard,

23:16.480 --> 23:19.199
but it's their emotional security
that's my main concern.

23:19.280 --> 23:23.558
I know Debbie does her best,
but you don't need me to tell you

23:23.640 --> 23:26.279
that it's not her place to look after
two young children.

23:26.360 --> 23:28.555
Well, I hold me hands up.

23:28.640 --> 23:33.430
I have made mistakes,
but... a lot of that is

23:33.520 --> 23:38.514
to do with the fall-out of my wife
leaving me to cope on my own and...

23:38.600 --> 23:40.955
Well, simply, I couldn't.

23:43.240 --> 23:50.510
Er... I wasn't ready for, you know,
the responsibility then. But I am now.

23:50.600 --> 23:56.197
And he will have back-up. I know
I'm not officially part of the family,

23:56.280 --> 23:59.989
but they took me to their hearts
when I had no-one,

24:00.080 --> 24:03.152
and I'd like to repay that kindness

24:03.240 --> 24:07.518
by doing whatever I can to make sure
Liam and Stella are safe and secure.

24:14.480 --> 24:16.391
I'm still awake, aren't I?

24:16.480 --> 24:19.916
And that's got to be a good thing,
knowing that we've got that...

24:20.000 --> 24:23.709
support from Norma,
that back-up, whenever...

24:27.080 --> 24:28.513
...we need it.

24:31.000 --> 24:33.195
Oh, shit!

24:34.240 --> 24:36.037
I know you think I'm stupid.

24:36.120 --> 24:40.238
I know he's not the man
you'd have picked for me, but...

24:40.320 --> 24:42.880
you can't help who you fall
in love with, can you, Mam?

24:45.640 --> 24:47.631
I just wish I could be stronger.

24:47.720 --> 24:48.914
More like you.

24:51.200 --> 24:53.998
We're more alike
than you'll ever know.

24:58.280 --> 25:01.431
- You knew what was riding on this!
- I'm sorry. I should have remembered.

25:01.520 --> 25:04.239
If I'd don't have a drink,
or a spliff or an E...

25:04.320 --> 25:06.675
If I don't anaesthetise myself,
the hormones kick in

25:06.760 --> 25:09.354
and Lickle Frank thinks he's 15.

25:09.440 --> 25:13.115
Oh, come on! Who the fuck's
going to be attracted to Norma?

25:13.200 --> 25:14.315
Your wife, for one!

25:14.400 --> 25:17.517
I am the victim of a liberated libido.

25:17.600 --> 25:19.830
Anything can get Lickle Frank going.
Sitting on the back of the bus,

25:19.920 --> 25:21.797
flicking through the knicker section
of the catalogue,

25:21.880 --> 25:23.598
and don't say you don't know
what I'm talking about.

25:23.680 --> 25:24.749
You fuck off!

25:24.840 --> 25:27.115
Come on. Out of all of them,
you're most like me -

25:27.200 --> 25:28.758
your brains are in your bollocks.

25:28.840 --> 25:31.035
Come on, help me out.
You know what it's like.

25:31.120 --> 25:32.951
I'm nothing like you, all right?

25:33.040 --> 25:35.838
If Debbie hadn't had a go
at that social worker,

25:35.920 --> 25:37.478
none of this would have happened.

25:37.560 --> 25:39.994
No, you fucked it up, not Debbie!

25:40.080 --> 25:42.833
You've fucked it up with
each and every one of us, Dad.

25:42.920 --> 25:45.388
You had the chance
to put it right with Liam and Stella

25:45.480 --> 25:46.959
but you fucked that up, too.

25:48.600 --> 25:51.558
- I'm sorry.
- Aren't you always?

25:51.640 --> 25:53.073
I am!

25:54.760 --> 25:57.354
Will that bring your kids back?

26:01.960 --> 26:05.316
Liam? It's Debbie.
Look, I'm on my way round.

26:05.400 --> 26:06.833
Make sure you're in.

26:32.200 --> 26:34.316
DOOR CLOSES

26:37.200 --> 26:38.633
Hello?

26:49.360 --> 26:52.238
Not a bad place. Got potential.

26:52.320 --> 26:55.835
- How d'you find me?
- I followed you from your dad's. Yours?

26:55.920 --> 26:58.957
Must be worth a few bob. Sugar daddy?

26:59.040 --> 27:02.350
Some rich eccentric pop his clogs
after slotting you one?

27:02.440 --> 27:04.954
Don't talk to me like that.
I'm not 15 any more.

27:05.040 --> 27:07.429
- What are you after?
- Why would I want anything?

27:07.520 --> 27:10.796
Because it's the only time I ever saw you
with a fucking smile on your face.

27:10.880 --> 27:16.034
I missed you. Realised how wrong
I got it when we were together,

27:16.120 --> 27:19.510
how stupid I was
throwing what we had away.

27:20.680 --> 27:22.318
How much I loved you...

27:22.400 --> 27:25.153
That wouldn't have worked on me
even when I was a kid.

27:25.240 --> 27:26.593
What are you really after?

27:26.680 --> 27:29.717
I need somewhere to crash.
I wouldn't ask if I wasn't desperate.

27:29.800 --> 27:31.870
Do I look like I give a fuck?

27:31.960 --> 27:34.997
How about a couple of quid,
you know, just tide me over?

27:36.120 --> 27:39.510
They said they'd kill me!
If I don't pay back what I owe.

27:39.600 --> 27:42.194
Kill me, lan! Ten grand!

27:42.280 --> 27:44.032
I ain't got that sort of cash.

27:44.120 --> 27:47.635
Well, sell this place. Take out
a fucking loan! I'm desperate here.

27:51.400 --> 27:54.153
Fuck you, then. Fuck... you!

28:06.160 --> 28:08.116
- Hiya.
- Hiya, Debbie. Come in.

28:08.880 --> 28:10.677
I would have called, but...

28:10.760 --> 28:14.594
It's OK. I said you could call
any time, and I meant it.

28:14.680 --> 28:17.069
Thanks.
BABY CRIES

28:17.160 --> 28:18.149
Can I pick her up?

28:20.160 --> 28:21.832
So how's things?

28:23.440 --> 28:26.910
I just miss them both like mad.
How's Liam been?

28:27.000 --> 28:28.911
Ask him yourself.

28:30.480 --> 28:32.994
Can we go out? Town maybe?

28:33.080 --> 28:35.833
- We could go for a pizza.
- I'd have to come with you.

28:35.920 --> 28:38.150
Rules, Debbie. Sorry.

28:40.280 --> 28:41.474
Sure.

28:42.600 --> 28:45.160
Hiya, hello.

28:45.240 --> 28:46.992
I know he was a bastard.

28:47.080 --> 28:50.993
I know he tret me like shit
and the kids even worse.

28:51.080 --> 28:54.231
I know I should have told him
to fuck off, Stan.

28:55.840 --> 28:59.628
When he were there, telling me
he'd realised what a mistake he'd made

28:59.720 --> 29:01.278
and how sorry he was,

29:01.360 --> 29:04.830
I just remembered
how much I used to love him.

29:06.440 --> 29:08.192
I just wanted to help.

29:11.600 --> 29:14.239
If you love him,
tell me, and I'll walk away.

29:14.320 --> 29:17.278
<i>No! No, Stan. I love you.</i>

29:18.880 --> 29:21.155
I just felt so sorry for him.

29:22.640 --> 29:25.677
And that, if that can help him find

29:25.760 --> 29:29.469
just a little bit of happiness
in his life, it'll be worth every penny.

29:39.000 --> 29:42.549
The whole family's in pieces.
Dad's taking it particularly bad.

29:42.640 --> 29:45.712
I'm sure it won't be long before
you're all together again.

29:45.800 --> 29:47.597
What does your social worker say?

29:47.680 --> 29:50.069
She's got to get the reports in,
see what the bosses recommend.

29:50.160 --> 29:51.639
Oh, darling.

30:00.440 --> 30:01.919
- Maria!
- I'll get it.

30:30.560 --> 30:32.073
Are you OK?

30:32.160 --> 30:33.559
Aaaaargh!

30:36.880 --> 30:38.916
Do you want to call it a day?

30:44.960 --> 30:47.110
I can't afford to grow a conscience, son.

30:47.200 --> 30:49.191
Where to next?

30:49.280 --> 30:51.396
Are you going straight back on duty, then?

30:51.480 --> 30:54.119
No rest for the wicked.

30:54.200 --> 30:56.873
Thanks again, Lillian.

30:56.960 --> 30:58.837
You still on for tonight?

30:58.920 --> 31:01.912
I wouldn't miss it for the world,
Mr Huckenhall.

31:02.000 --> 31:04.833
- Colin... please.
- Oh, right.

31:15.240 --> 31:17.674
L2,372.

31:17.760 --> 31:20.558
Thanks, Von.
You don't know what this means.

31:20.640 --> 31:23.154
She knows exactly what it means.

31:23.240 --> 31:26.391
It means you're L7,628 short.

31:26.480 --> 31:29.552
I've ordered the cash from the bank,
I'll bring it to you later.

31:29.640 --> 31:31.949
Why didn't you just tell the truth?

31:32.040 --> 31:34.759
All that shit about
loving me and the kids.

31:34.840 --> 31:37.832
- All that was true!
- Bollocks! You tried that with me.

31:37.920 --> 31:39.592
Using your own kids

31:39.680 --> 31:43.275
- to get a few bob out of her.
- Take it back, then. Go on, take it.

31:43.360 --> 31:45.157
If that's all you think I'm here for.

31:45.240 --> 31:47.754
(Stan) If that's all it takes to get
rid of you, it's worth every penny.

31:47.840 --> 31:52.470
You get it on the understanding that
you never set foot back here again.

31:52.560 --> 31:55.791
Try and contact the kids,
and I'll fucking kill you.

31:55.880 --> 31:58.314
And if she doesn't, I will.

31:58.400 --> 31:59.913
And if they don't...

32:00.000 --> 32:01.718
Yeah, I got the message.

32:03.920 --> 32:06.309
If there was any other way, Yvonne.

32:07.760 --> 32:09.432
I just got in over me head.

32:09.520 --> 32:11.875
Borrowed too much money
from the wrong kind of people.

32:11.960 --> 32:14.269
I'll drop the cash here tonight.
Seven o'clock.

32:16.280 --> 32:17.554
What?

32:19.160 --> 32:20.639
I had no option.

32:28.520 --> 32:31.717
<i>This will do the trick, won't it?
This will be the last we see of him.</i>

32:31.800 --> 32:34.758
I already thought that were the last
I'd seen of him.

32:34.840 --> 32:37.638
We've got to make him understand,
there's no more after this has gone.

32:37.720 --> 32:41.190
There's the shop. That's what
worries me, he knows I've got the shop.

32:41.280 --> 32:43.669
Where the fuck is this gonna end
short of killing the little shit?

32:43.760 --> 32:45.955
- Be serious.
- I am.

33:15.200 --> 33:16.713
And the cupboard was bare.

33:29.440 --> 33:31.431
I didn't know if you'd be in
after what you said.

33:31.520 --> 33:35.559
I thought you might be out, you know,
shagging women, trying drugs.

33:35.640 --> 33:39.918
Asserting your masculinity.
Not that I've got a problem with that.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.797
Could do you a fry-up in ten.

33:45.880 --> 33:47.598
Sit down.

33:47.680 --> 33:49.671
It's your house, after all.

33:54.840 --> 33:55.909
MIMI CLEARS THROAT

33:56.000 --> 33:59.834
I was just thinking...
about what you said earlier.

34:03.320 --> 34:06.312
And if those are the conditions
I have to agree to

34:06.400 --> 34:09.676
in order for this marriage
to survive... then so be it.

34:09.760 --> 34:11.318
Yeah?

34:12.520 --> 34:13.998
I've got one condition.

34:14.080 --> 34:15.274
Name it.

34:15.360 --> 34:18.112
You never bring
any of the women home.

34:18.199 --> 34:20.156
Done.

34:24.520 --> 34:27.353
And what's sauce for the goose
is sauce for the gander.

34:27.440 --> 34:32.195
I've been on the internet. There's
an escort agency in Deansgate.

34:32.280 --> 34:37.877
150 quid gets me an hour with Mike,
a student at the uni. Australian.

34:37.960 --> 34:41.793
44 inch chest, 32 inch waist,

34:41.880 --> 34:44.393
and a cock like a baby's arm
holding a peach.

34:47.199 --> 34:50.431
Speaking of which,
fruit salad OK for afters?

34:50.520 --> 34:52.795
Take the peaches out.

34:53.159 --> 34:56.118
I saw that look in your eye,
Stan, and it frightened me.

34:56.159 --> 34:58.628
Right, OK. I want to kill him!

34:58.720 --> 35:00.711
I could strangle the fucker
with me bare hands!

35:02.320 --> 35:05.676
- Got any Eccles cakes?
- We're right out. Sorry.

35:08.560 --> 35:11.074
That bastard has the audacity
to come back in here

35:11.160 --> 35:13.958
after all these years
and threaten everything we have.

35:14.040 --> 35:17.919
I could slit his throat, I could
peel the fucker, stab the twat!

35:18.000 --> 35:19.877
I could bury him alive.
Electrocute him!

35:19.960 --> 35:24.556
I could hammer nails
through his thick fucking skull!

35:24.640 --> 35:26.870
I could eat him.
Yeah, that's right, I could eat him.

35:26.960 --> 35:29.190
But I wouldn't cook the cunt.

35:29.280 --> 35:31.510
I'd eat the fucker raw!

35:35.800 --> 35:37.791
What is it doing to us?

35:37.880 --> 35:40.075
What's it turning us into?

35:40.160 --> 35:44.631
You're right. Oh, dear God,
I'm sorry, Yvonne. You're right.

35:44.720 --> 35:46.153
What was I thinking?

35:46.240 --> 35:49.915
We don't need this.
It's all just material stuff.

35:50.000 --> 35:51.194
It can be replaced.

35:52.440 --> 35:57.833
What's important is
me, you and the kids.

35:57.920 --> 36:02.596
We stay one step ahead of Kash,
and we tell the kids everything.

36:02.680 --> 36:04.318
We go to the police now.

36:04.400 --> 36:08.916
Tell them about the sham suicide
and the phoney insurance claim.

36:09.000 --> 36:13.471
We'll go down for it, but they'll be
lenient if we co-operate, which we will.

36:13.560 --> 36:16.597
We're looking at five, ten years, max.

36:16.680 --> 36:18.910
But... we'll keep our dignity,

36:19.000 --> 36:23.232
be able to hold our heads high in
the knowledge that there's no-one

36:23.320 --> 36:27.472
out there with anything over us.
We're better than him, Yvonne.

36:27.560 --> 36:30.757
- Ten years?
- Max.

36:30.840 --> 36:33.718
Fuck that. Let's kill him.

36:38.600 --> 36:41.717
You took her without permission?

36:41.800 --> 36:45.236
Which means effectively
you've kidnapped Stella. And Liam.

36:45.320 --> 36:47.834
- No.
- Why can't we go home?

36:47.920 --> 36:49.592
Cos Soft Shite has got
half of Manchester's finest

36:49.680 --> 36:51.955
combing the estate looking for you two.

36:52.040 --> 36:56.477
- You wanted them back - here they are.
- Quiet! We need to sort this and quick.

36:56.560 --> 37:00.519
- Has the carer tried ringing you?
- I haven't had my phone turned on.

37:00.600 --> 37:02.272
Say there's been a mix-up.

37:02.360 --> 37:05.955
What happened on the bus
was a genuine mistake.

37:06.040 --> 37:09.077
You didn't charge your phone,
you panicked and ran back here.

37:09.160 --> 37:10.275
I just hope they believe you.

37:15.200 --> 37:17.839
Hang on, Debs.
Let's just try one more thing.

37:19.040 --> 37:21.190
Colin wants us to do it al fresco.
Think I should?

37:21.280 --> 37:25.831
Why not? Start by half six,
most people are in having their tea.

37:25.920 --> 37:27.512
MOANING

37:31.200 --> 37:34.112
Don't we normally do stock-take
at night?

37:34.200 --> 37:36.316
Do you want the 30 quid, or don't you?

37:36.400 --> 37:38.675
Well get in there
and shut the fuck up.

37:42.800 --> 37:45.519
Three hours. Plenty of time.
We can afford to chill out a bit.

37:45.600 --> 37:47.636
- Get our heads clear.
- We can do this.

37:47.720 --> 37:49.392
We can do...

37:49.480 --> 37:53.871
Yvonne! You said ages back
you used to be a foster carer.

37:56.520 --> 37:57.839
We need a favour.

38:04.360 --> 38:05.839
So what is it you're suggesting?

38:05.920 --> 38:07.751
I'm still registered. The kids come to me

38:07.840 --> 38:10.638
while the family re-adjust
to the new circumstances.

38:10.720 --> 38:13.792
- Monica doing a bunk.
- It's not that easy, Yvonne.

38:13.880 --> 38:15.916
I know you've got reservations
about Frank's abilities as a parent.

38:16.000 --> 38:17.513
Who hasn't?

38:17.600 --> 38:19.431
Take a positive step.

38:19.520 --> 38:21.556
If I'm allowed to foster the kids,
they're just next door,

38:21.640 --> 38:24.837
close proximity to the siblings,
lower stress levels for everyone.

38:24.920 --> 38:27.593
- Yours included.
- But what about their father?

38:27.680 --> 38:31.150
He can barely look after himself.
Where is he, anyhow?

38:31.240 --> 38:34.357
He's popped down to see his best mate.

38:36.880 --> 38:38.632
Aaah!

38:38.720 --> 38:41.837
Let's not write him off just yet.
If I'm approved, it should be

38:41.920 --> 38:43.911
on the condition
he attends parenting classes.

38:47.560 --> 38:50.074
Look, you know as well as I do

38:50.160 --> 38:53.118
that once you put this to your bosses,
they'll bite your hand off.

38:53.200 --> 38:55.236
One less family on the at-risk register,

38:55.320 --> 38:57.629
I'm back on your books,
you're throwing kids at me

38:57.720 --> 39:02.350
left, right and centre and I'll take
them. I'll help you, you help me.

39:06.000 --> 39:08.036
Well... it couldn't be immediate.

39:08.120 --> 39:12.238
Oh, no! We couldn't cope with immediate.

39:12.320 --> 39:14.880
We've got a few things
to get out of the way first.

39:14.960 --> 39:18.077
Can we have tea here,
then go back to Maria's later?

39:20.200 --> 39:24.159
Then you put your report in, tell them
the brilliant idea you've come up with.

39:24.240 --> 39:25.389
Brownie points for you,

39:25.480 --> 39:28.199
kids are back where they belong,
everybody's happy.

39:29.600 --> 39:32.433
- Back in Maria's by nine?
- Deal.

39:33.960 --> 39:36.679
- Oh, Yvonne, man!
- No need. Bye!

39:41.200 --> 39:44.749
I won't be able to keep it to myself.

39:44.840 --> 39:46.990
- I'll tell people. I'll confess.
- Tell them what?

39:47.080 --> 39:48.433
That we killed him.

39:48.520 --> 39:51.353
He's dead already,
how do you kill a dead man? Look...

39:51.440 --> 39:55.228
we've still got an hour.
Let's go over it one more time.

39:55.320 --> 39:58.835
<i>(Stan) You prep the room,
make it forensic proof.</i>

39:58.920 --> 40:00.717
<i>I make myself scarce.</i>

40:01.680 --> 40:03.398
<i>We wait.</i>

40:05.080 --> 40:08.277
<i>(Yvonne) When he turns up,
I keep him talking.</i>

40:08.360 --> 40:11.158
<i>Some guff about
you fetching the money.</i>

40:12.680 --> 40:14.671
<i>I keep him busy, while you...</i>

40:15.480 --> 40:17.516
Then, once he's dead,

40:17.600 --> 40:19.955
I bought a season ticket
to Knowsley Safari Park.

40:20.040 --> 40:23.828
Go as many times as we like,
but I think it'll only take four trips.

40:23.920 --> 40:25.876
Arms, legs, torso, head.

40:25.960 --> 40:28.918
Once we've driven
into the lion enclosure,

40:29.000 --> 40:31.719
it's windows down
and bye-bye, Kash.

40:36.720 --> 40:37.755
OK.

40:38.800 --> 40:39.915
OK.

40:49.400 --> 40:52.198
RADIO PLAYS

40:56.640 --> 40:58.039
DOOR OPENS

41:14.840 --> 41:16.353
How the fuck did you get in? We're closed.

41:20.120 --> 41:21.553
Kept my keys.

41:33.680 --> 41:35.636
MUSIC PLAYS

41:50.920 --> 41:52.956
I'm sorry I lied.

41:53.040 --> 41:55.952
But believe me, son, I had no choice.

41:56.040 --> 41:58.634
If I hadn't, you, your mum, Meena...

41:58.720 --> 42:01.871
you'd have lost everything.
Everything.

42:03.040 --> 42:05.873
- They said you killed yourself.
- It was the only way

42:05.960 --> 42:09.316
I could think of getting you
out of the mess that I'd made.

42:09.400 --> 42:11.311
I went to your funeral.

42:12.720 --> 42:15.837
- I'm sorry.
- I prayed every night for your soul.

42:17.400 --> 42:19.994
- Fuck off!
- Please, son.

42:20.080 --> 42:23.072
I said fuck off. I mean fuck off!

42:31.560 --> 42:35.473
He's not coming.
There's summat wrong, I can feel it.

42:39.080 --> 42:41.719
- You lied.
- I had no choice.

42:41.800 --> 42:44.030
You could have told me,
you could have trusted me!

42:44.120 --> 42:45.951
If I'd stayed,
I would've taken you down with me.

42:46.040 --> 42:47.268
I'd have gone with you!

42:49.400 --> 42:51.277
I'd have gone.

43:02.440 --> 43:03.714
I'm sorry.

43:15.000 --> 43:16.479

Hiya, kid.

43:55.200 --> 43:56.918
I'm sorry.

43:57.000 --> 43:59.116
Don't be.
I think we'll be all right now.

43:59.200 --> 44:02.192
- Thanks, Norma.
- It's all right.

44:03.480 --> 44:08.395
Look... all of this has kind of
got us thinking.

44:09.640 --> 44:11.835
I'm not sure I can explain
what I'm feeling.

44:12.960 --> 44:14.393
But let me try.

Ohh!

Chesney!

Someone get him out!

44:52.120 --> 44:54.953
Oh, my God!
My son's in there!

44:55.040 --> 44:56.678
Get him out, please!

44:56.760 --> 45:00.548
No! Oh, my God, he's there!
Get off me!

45:00.640 --> 45:01.993
Fire's out the back.

45:03.760 --> 45:05.432
Are you all right? Are you hurt?

45:11.400 --> 45:13.118
Were there anybody else in there?

45:16.720 --> 45:20.110
You know who was in there. Don't you?

45:23.000 --> 45:25.389
Some old fella.

45:25.480 --> 45:27.277
A tramp.

45:27.360 --> 45:29.749
He broke in, he's still in there.
