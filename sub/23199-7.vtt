01:59.119 --> 02:00.829
Right. I'm on my way.

02:10.714 --> 02:12.215
Diana is on her way.

02:58.761 --> 03:00.138
How'd you get here so fast?

03:00.221 --> 03:02.891
There's not much traffic
at 6:00 a. m. in the morning.

03:02.974 --> 03:05.727
Why has every crisis since World War II...

03:05.810 --> 03:08.354
happened in the middle of
my beauty sleep?

03:08.521 --> 03:10.940
You're not getting too old for this,
are you, Joe?

03:11.024 --> 03:14.235
I was too old for this
before either one of you were born.

03:14.402 --> 03:17.155
Thank you all for responding so promptly.

03:17.363 --> 03:20.491
This secret tape
was made yesterday at Miami.

03:20.575 --> 03:25.455
An hour ago, I.D. Analysis
identified this man as Evan Robley.

03:25.997 --> 03:27.623
It's Robley all right, sir.

03:27.707 --> 03:31.586
I remember him from the time he stole
the nuclear plans from the French Navy.

03:31.669 --> 03:35.089
Evan Robley has stolen
just about everything from everybody.

03:35.256 --> 03:39.802
If there were a thieves Hall of Fame,
Evan Robley would be a charter member.

03:39.886 --> 03:41.470
Well said, Steve.

03:42.305 --> 03:47.143
This tape was sent by Interpol
after Robley robbed the Bangkok Mint.

03:47.810 --> 03:51.897
You can see it shows him
enjoying his ill-gotten gains.

03:52.356 --> 03:55.109
Apparently free of any fear
of apprehension.

03:56.110 --> 03:58.654
I'd like you to study his disguise.

03:58.988 --> 04:02.992
As far as I'm concerned,
he is the grand master.

04:03.367 --> 04:08.247
Not only of disguises,
but international thieves as well.

04:13.127 --> 04:17.630
This was the I.D. he used
to steal the rocket fuel formula...

04:17.755 --> 04:20.050
from the top secret Turkish Air base.

04:20.551 --> 04:21.802
We got him that time, sir.

04:21.886 --> 04:25.347
Yes. For about 10 minutes.
He escaped on the way to jail.

04:25.598 --> 04:27.766
He's in Palm Beach now.

04:27.850 --> 04:32.521
The millionaire's sandbox
and I want you to know he plays up to it.

04:32.688 --> 04:35.816
But I want to know
exactly what he's up to.

04:36.233 --> 04:37.693
Thank you, and good morning.

04:37.776 --> 04:39.069
Good early morning.

04:39.153 --> 04:41.238
Good morning, sir.

04:41.321 --> 04:43.949
You think Robley is after something
here in Washington?

04:44.032 --> 04:45.826
Why would he go to Florida?

04:46.285 --> 04:48.620
I've got an idea. Come on.

04:58.714 --> 05:02.509
All of my mornings spent poring over
newspapers has finally paid off.

05:02.676 --> 05:06.972
Queen Kathryn of Malakar happens to be
in Palm Beach, Florida at this moment.

05:10.017 --> 05:12.936
- Brilliant deduction, my dear Watson.
- Thank you, Holmes.

05:13.020 --> 05:15.856
Would one of you mind telling me
what's going on here?

05:15.939 --> 05:18.775
Queen Kathryn
is this generation's Cinderella.

05:19.443 --> 05:22.487
She met the Prince of Malakar
on a Mediterranean cruise.

05:22.571 --> 05:24.823
They fell in love and were married.

05:24.906 --> 05:27.742
Last year her husband died
and she became queen.

05:28.660 --> 05:32.247
Not bad for little old Kathy O'Reilly
from Boston, Massachusetts.

05:32.330 --> 05:34.833
Of course, now I remember.
But who doesn't?

05:35.000 --> 05:37.586
But what has this got to do
with Evan Robley?

05:38.044 --> 05:40.839
She brought with her
what amounts to the Malakar heritage.

05:40.922 --> 05:43.341
A priceless diamond crown and necklace.

05:44.259 --> 05:46.094
Then she'll need protection.

05:48.138 --> 05:50.765
Wait a minute.
She's staying at the Malakar Consulate.

05:50.849 --> 05:53.977
We have absolutely
no jurisdiction there whatsoever.

05:54.310 --> 05:56.062
We'll have to go undercover.

05:56.146 --> 05:58.481
Once inside, you'll be strictly on your own.

05:58.565 --> 05:59.607
Of course.

05:59.691 --> 06:03.111
This is the Malakar ambassador
to the U.S. greeting her, isn't it?

06:03.194 --> 06:06.614
Yes, it's the same Gregory Orrick
that was so critical of Kathryn...

06:06.698 --> 06:08.283
when she took the throne.

06:08.366 --> 06:12.078
You can't blame the man for being
chauvinistic about his country, Diana.

06:12.161 --> 06:15.206
Kathryn O'Reilly was a bit
of a wild shamrock.

06:15.290 --> 06:18.126
I would label this whole thing,
"Handle with care. "

06:18.209 --> 06:19.544
And "Dispatch. "

06:19.836 --> 06:21.713
- Shall we, Steve?
- Indeed, we shall.

06:21.796 --> 06:23.965
I'll make the reservations.
You two get packed.

06:24.048 --> 06:25.383
We stay packed, Joe.

06:25.466 --> 06:26.884
How's the weather in Palm Beach?

06:26.968 --> 06:28.886
About the same it is in Malakar.

06:28.970 --> 06:30.179
Only more so.

06:30.430 --> 06:32.557
- Good trip.
- So long, Joe.

06:38.020 --> 06:40.857
Ready Jet Star Number 2
for Trevor and Prince immediately.

07:06.966 --> 07:08.050
Come in.

07:16.600 --> 07:17.852
Any problems?

07:18.227 --> 07:20.938
Not at all.
My credentials worked perfectly.

07:21.230 --> 07:23.816
You are serving tea, which I didn't order...

07:23.899 --> 07:25.526
to the honorable Stephen Ludwig...

07:25.609 --> 07:28.654
President of The American-Malakar
Cultural Association.

07:29.113 --> 07:32.324
I can see that male chauvinism
is still alive and well.

07:32.908 --> 07:36.620
You're the Honorable Stephen Ludwig,
while I'm the honorable new domestic...

07:36.704 --> 07:39.123
hired to serve at the reception tomorrow.

07:39.206 --> 07:40.582
That's the breaks.

07:40.874 --> 07:44.044
- The tea isn't for you. It's for Count Diaz.
- Who's he?

07:44.169 --> 07:46.171
Some distant cousin of the late king.

07:46.255 --> 07:47.798
- Kitchen talk.
- I'll get it.

07:47.881 --> 07:50.175
They say anything else about him
in the kitchen?

07:50.259 --> 07:51.510
Not much more.

07:52.845 --> 07:53.887
Watch the butler.

07:53.971 --> 07:56.473
I'm worried about the way
he's watching me.

07:56.557 --> 08:00.435
By the way, the local IADC put a tail
on Robley after Atkinson's cable.

08:00.519 --> 08:01.562
They lost him.

08:01.645 --> 08:04.022
- He'll turn up.
- Just a second.

08:05.524 --> 08:07.859
- All clear.
- Thank you, Mr. Ludwig.

08:20.163 --> 08:23.667
Your tea, Count Diaz.

08:28.672 --> 08:30.549
You cannot be a maid.

08:33.260 --> 08:35.136
You must be a princess.

08:36.388 --> 08:39.390
No one as lovely as you
should be serving tea.

08:39.515 --> 08:42.644
- It's my privilege, sir. Will that be all?
- Certainly not.

08:42.727 --> 08:45.814
I intend to order everything
in Cousin Kathryn's royal kitchen.

08:45.981 --> 08:48.441
Is there a name to go along with
such a pretty face?

08:48.525 --> 08:50.151
Yes, sir. Diana.

08:51.611 --> 08:53.613
Diana, the goddess of hunt.

08:53.697 --> 08:55.782
Are you a huntress like your namesake?

08:55.865 --> 08:58.451
If you are, I'm your willing prey.

08:59.536 --> 09:02.163
I really must return to my duties,
Count Diaz.

09:02.247 --> 09:05.542
If I request that your duty
is to join me for tea?

09:05.625 --> 09:08.837
I would be flattered,
and fired, in that order.

09:08.920 --> 09:12.298
I would throw myself at my cousin's feet,
and beg her to rehire you.

09:12.757 --> 09:15.760
Count Diaz,
I trust your rooms are comfortable.

09:15.844 --> 09:19.430
My accommodations have brightened
considerably. Thanks, Mr. Ambassador.

09:19.514 --> 09:20.640
What may I do for you?

09:20.723 --> 09:23.643
Queen Kathryn has granted
your request for a private audience.

09:23.726 --> 09:24.852
Before tea?

09:24.936 --> 09:26.271
- Immediately.
- How thoughtful.

09:26.354 --> 09:29.857
I'm afraid, lovely Diana, you'll have to
take this back to the kitchen.

09:29.941 --> 09:33.277
- Yes, sir.
- But keep it warm. I'll be in touch.

09:34.153 --> 09:35.822
Wonderful country, America.

09:35.905 --> 09:39.283
Its servants are more beautiful
than some of my royal cousins.

10:24.120 --> 10:26.747
Suppose we stop playing games,
Count Diaz?

10:26.831 --> 10:28.791
You can start by telling me who you are.

10:28.874 --> 10:30.209
Why, Kathryn...

10:30.292 --> 10:33.629
I'm your dear departed husband's
second cousin once removed.

10:34.088 --> 10:36.382
In that case, you may remove yourself.

10:36.799 --> 10:38.425
Because there is no such person.

10:38.509 --> 10:42.096
I had to tell the ambassador
something to acquire an invitation.

10:44.765 --> 10:48.560
In actual fact, Your Majesty,
I'm Agent Clark Scott...

10:48.644 --> 10:50.521
Inter Agency Defense Command.

11:04.660 --> 11:07.496
I'd begun to wonder if my homeland
had forsaken me.

11:07.579 --> 11:09.039
Far from it, Your Majesty.

11:09.206 --> 11:13.210
The orders to protect you
come from very rarified territory.

11:15.128 --> 11:17.714
I'm so surrounded
with enemies in Malakar...

11:18.924 --> 11:21.009
it's hard to believe I could have a friend.

11:21.093 --> 11:24.388
But you have.
And not just in the top drawer.

11:25.263 --> 11:28.392
I pulled every string I could
to obtain this assignment.

11:29.267 --> 11:31.770
It's an honor to serve you, Your Majesty.

11:33.563 --> 11:36.691
How gallant. Thank you, Mr. Scott.

11:38.485 --> 11:40.529
Count Diaz, your cousin.

11:41.112 --> 11:42.864
Of course. Once removed.

11:43.657 --> 11:45.867
- Won't you sit down?
- Thank you.

11:47.702 --> 11:49.746
Now, to get back to business...

11:50.455 --> 11:54.501
the United States is quite concerned
about the safety of the royal jewels.

11:54.709 --> 11:56.044
May I ask...

11:56.127 --> 11:58.672
why you brought them
on such a risky journey?

12:00.298 --> 12:01.925
Ambassador Orrick insisted...

12:02.008 --> 12:06.179
that it would be the best possible way
to silence my many critics in Malakar.

12:06.471 --> 12:10.767
You see, they believe
that I'm nothing but a fortune hunter.

12:11.643 --> 12:13.937
But if I can bring the crown jewels here...

12:14.020 --> 12:17.607
to my native country,
and return them safely to Malakar...

12:17.732 --> 12:20.068
my critics will be out of ammunition.

12:20.610 --> 12:22.695
I find his advice questionable.

12:22.820 --> 12:26.449
Now that the jewels are here,
we must do our best to protect them.

12:27.951 --> 12:30.787
I've taken a few precautionary
measures of my own.

12:30.870 --> 12:33.206
The Consulate's security system
is excellent.

12:33.289 --> 12:36.542
I understand that
the vault here is near impregnable.

12:37.126 --> 12:41.631
I agree. But that would be the first place
that the thief would look for the jewels.

12:42.507 --> 12:44.425
Then they're not in the vault?

12:44.926 --> 12:49.806
The crown and the diamond necklace
are in a hidden safe.

12:57.855 --> 13:00.566
Then, may I suggest, Your Majesty...

13:00.942 --> 13:02.985
it remain your secret?

13:03.736 --> 13:06.364
Thank you. Then I need only trust myself.

13:06.447 --> 13:09.533
An excellent idea.
Now I need only protect you.

13:10.076 --> 13:12.036
I've long believed, you know...

13:12.119 --> 13:14.580
that the most valuable jewel of Malakar...

13:16.040 --> 13:17.375
was her queen.

13:20.294 --> 13:21.379
Thank you.

13:22.421 --> 13:25.091
You've made me feel
very welcome, Mr. Scott.

13:26.550 --> 13:29.470
Won't you join me for refreshments?
Perhaps some tea?

13:29.553 --> 13:31.931
Thank you. Allow me.

13:39.230 --> 13:40.731
This is Count Diaz.

13:41.273 --> 13:44.860
Would you tell my maid, Diana,
that she can serve my tea in here?

13:45.527 --> 13:47.321
Yes, immediately. Thank you.

14:05.214 --> 14:08.258
Since you feel threatened
by some of your countrymen...

14:08.717 --> 14:11.720
have you checked
your chambers for listening devices?

14:12.095 --> 14:14.681
- You mean bugs.
- Yes, bugs.

14:15.057 --> 14:19.228
Let's begin by looking
at the more obvious places, shall we?

14:23.106 --> 14:26.485
Electronic surveillance
has become a fine art, Your Majesty.

14:26.860 --> 14:29.112
To the point where it is now possible...

14:29.196 --> 14:31.823
to conceal a transistorized transmitter...

14:31.907 --> 14:34.117
in the olive of a dry martini.

14:34.284 --> 14:37.245
These tiny objects, no larger than a dime...

14:37.329 --> 14:39.873
can be placed anywhere. Behind curtains...

14:41.750 --> 14:44.419
the telephone, bookcases.

14:44.753 --> 14:46.463
Literally anywhere.

14:52.344 --> 14:55.013
One cannot be too careful, Your Majesty.

14:57.641 --> 14:59.809
Our tea. I'll just make sure.

15:07.609 --> 15:11.529
Diana, I knew by asking for you,
we'd receive amazing service.

15:11.613 --> 15:14.741
Thank you, my dear.
You've been such a help. You may go.

15:23.208 --> 15:24.292
Come in.

15:28.213 --> 15:30.965
- Steve, you're not going to believe this.
- What?

15:31.382 --> 15:34.302
- I left with tea for Count Diaz, right?
- Right.

15:34.510 --> 15:37.889
I served it to Evan Robley
in the Queen's chambers.

15:39.307 --> 15:41.851
- He certainly doesn't lack nerve.
- Or charm.

15:41.934 --> 15:43.895
Kathryn's eating out of his hand.

15:43.978 --> 15:45.480
What's he doing with the queen...

15:45.563 --> 15:47.982
when the subterranean vault
is under the consulate?

15:48.066 --> 15:50.568
Is it possible the jewels
are not in the vault?

15:50.651 --> 15:52.820
Anything's possible with Evan Robley.

15:54.781 --> 15:57.116
- We better get rid of him.
- Easier said.

15:57.450 --> 15:59.327
Do you think we should warn her?

15:59.744 --> 16:02.914
From what you've told me,
she just might blow our cover.

16:03.206 --> 16:04.874
What should we do?

16:06.125 --> 16:08.085
Joe arranged for a warrant.

16:08.794 --> 16:11.088
If we can get him off
the consulate grounds...

16:11.172 --> 16:13.257
we can legally take him into custody.

16:14.300 --> 16:17.595
He's a very clever man, Steve.
It won't be easy.

16:17.970 --> 16:20.056
I got a plan that just might do it.

16:20.139 --> 16:22.808
Meet me by the front gate after dark.
Can you make it?

16:22.892 --> 16:24.602
The question is can you?

16:25.102 --> 16:26.729
Don't worry about that.

16:27.104 --> 16:28.647
Be careful, Steve.

16:36.280 --> 16:37.656
Good evening.

16:44.997 --> 16:46.373
Lose your way?

16:46.457 --> 16:49.293
As a matter of fact,
I've found it, Mr. Robley.

16:50.336 --> 16:53.547
You seem to have the social advantage
of knowing my name.

16:53.672 --> 16:57.384
Am I committing some unforgivable
faux pas by not remembering yours?

16:58.177 --> 17:00.554
My name isn't important,
but my business is.

17:00.637 --> 17:02.389
So I'll get right down to it.

17:03.015 --> 17:05.726
I'd like to buy the royal jewels of Malakar.

17:05.809 --> 17:08.145
Unfortunately, they are not mine to sell.

17:08.228 --> 17:10.731
I see. Well, before you fence them...

17:11.022 --> 17:13.192
I suggest you listen to my offer.

17:13.692 --> 17:16.194
This is all purely hypothetical, of course.

17:16.487 --> 17:21.032
But do you have any specific numbers,
or types of currency in mind?

17:21.867 --> 17:25.579
I'm talking about a very realistic amount
of untraceable cash...

17:25.662 --> 17:26.954
in the millions.

17:28.582 --> 17:32.210
- How can I be certain you'll deliver?
- You come with me and I'll show you.

17:32.294 --> 17:34.588
Are you suggesting I leave the grounds?

17:35.464 --> 17:39.426
The amount of money we're talking about
cannot be carried by one man.

17:40.010 --> 17:43.096
If you can't take the mountain of money
to Mohammed...

17:43.180 --> 17:46.057
Then Mohammed must move
to the money.

17:46.183 --> 17:49.102
Right. It's a short drive. 15 minutes.

17:52.022 --> 17:54.608
I must say
it's a very interesting proposition.

17:54.691 --> 17:58.612
The sight of neatly stacked treasury notes
is my favorite scenery.

17:59.863 --> 18:00.906
Shall we?

18:01.531 --> 18:04.784
This little trip will set you up
for the rest of your life.

18:05.994 --> 18:07.704
I better call the queen.

18:07.954 --> 18:09.080
Why?

18:09.247 --> 18:12.917
After all, she does have custody
of the baubles in question...

18:13.001 --> 18:14.377
however temporary.

18:15.587 --> 18:18.131
What was her private extension?

18:19.215 --> 18:21.468
I have it here somewhere I'm sure.

18:30.518 --> 18:32.061
Sorry, old boy.

18:35.523 --> 18:36.941
Nice try.

18:37.025 --> 18:39.736
Let's see if we can find out
who you really are.

19:03.551 --> 19:04.677
Count Diaz?

19:12.768 --> 19:13.895
Steve.

19:26.574 --> 19:28.743
- Diana, get out. Fast.
- Let me untie you.

19:28.826 --> 19:31.328
There's no time.
Robley sent for the security guards.

19:31.412 --> 19:33.664
If they find you here,
we're both out of action.

19:33.748 --> 19:34.832
I can't leave you here.

19:34.915 --> 19:38.043
You've got to. He knows who I am.
He found the warrant.

19:38.127 --> 19:39.503
Only you can stop him now.

19:39.587 --> 19:42.006
Put this gag back, and get out of here.

19:42.089 --> 19:43.466
Come on. Do it!

20:02.026 --> 20:03.944
Let's put him in a basement cell.

20:14.872 --> 20:18.041
Fortunately, Mr. Scott here
discovered that Mr. Ludwig...

20:18.167 --> 20:22.671
was not the president of The
American-Malakar Cultural Association...

20:22.880 --> 20:25.632
but a rather infamous jewel thief,
Evan Robley.

20:27.301 --> 20:30.095
We are greatly indebted to you, Mr. Scott.

20:31.096 --> 20:34.766
There are times when duty
becomes a pleasure, Your Majesty.

20:35.100 --> 20:37.352
We'll hold him
in our basement detention cell...

20:37.436 --> 20:39.771
until after you've left the country,
Your Majesty.

20:39.855 --> 20:42.190
The publicity might prove
most unfavorable.

20:42.274 --> 20:45.527
I don't believe we need have
any further fear for the jewels.

20:45.610 --> 20:48.321
Not as long as Mr. Scott
has my interest at heart.

20:50.699 --> 20:53.243
Please, Your Majesty,
you really must get some rest.

20:53.326 --> 20:56.371
- You've a big day tomorrow.
- Thank you, Mr. Ambassador.

20:56.746 --> 21:00.292
And thanks to you, Mr. Scott,
my rest will be untroubled.

21:00.667 --> 21:02.252
Good night, Your Majesty.

21:02.335 --> 21:04.462
- Good night, Your Majesty.
- Good night.

21:23.732 --> 21:27.610
I hope that's the last time
I bow to that American upstart.

21:27.694 --> 21:30.155
Providing, of course,
you're as good as they say.

21:30.238 --> 21:32.282
With that undercover agent
out of the way...

21:32.365 --> 21:34.075
the robbery will be child's play.

21:34.159 --> 21:37.287
My friends and I are paying you
too much for mere child's play.

21:37.370 --> 21:40.248
If you want to quibble about price,
let's forget it.

21:41.499 --> 21:43.334
No. Steal the jewels. Now.

21:43.668 --> 21:46.754
It will be worth your fee
just to see Kathryn's disgrace.

21:47.547 --> 21:50.758
When she appears at tomorrow's
reception and I start the rumor...

21:50.842 --> 21:52.760
that her jewels are missing...

21:52.969 --> 21:56.472
Queen Kathryn of Malakar
will again be common Kate of Boston.

21:56.556 --> 21:59.600
Please spare the details.
I find politics a bore.

22:02.729 --> 22:05.106
The Queen's order. Please open the door.

22:07.066 --> 22:10.570
If she complains the food's cold,
shall I tell her who's to blame?

22:12.488 --> 22:13.656
Thank you.

22:22.290 --> 22:25.167
- What is it?
- Late supper, Your Majesty.

22:25.251 --> 22:27.878
At this time of night? I ordered no supper.

22:28.212 --> 22:31.132
- What do you want?
- I had to see you, Your Majesty.

22:31.465 --> 22:32.758
You're being tricked.

22:32.842 --> 22:35.553
The royal jewels are in great danger
and so are you.

22:35.636 --> 22:38.097
How does a maid acquire this information?

22:38.180 --> 22:39.306
I'm not a maid.

22:39.390 --> 22:42.435
My name's Diana Prince.
I work with the IADC.

22:42.518 --> 22:44.437
You're working with Agent Scott?

22:45.104 --> 22:48.482
He is not an agent. He is a jewel thief.
Evan Robley.

22:49.108 --> 22:51.402
But Robley's been captured.

22:51.485 --> 22:53.571
That wasn't Robley.
That was Steve Trevor.

22:53.654 --> 22:54.697
We're both agents.

22:54.780 --> 22:57.741
We were sent to protect you
and stop the real Evan Robley...

22:57.825 --> 22:59.618
from stealing the royal jewels.

22:59.702 --> 23:03.414
Agent Scott's credentials were
thoroughly checked by my ambassador.

23:03.956 --> 23:05.791
- You're obviously lying.
- No.

23:06.208 --> 23:08.544
Your Majesty, I'm telling the truth.

23:09.211 --> 23:10.671
You've got to believe me.

23:12.089 --> 23:13.549
Call this number.

23:14.466 --> 23:17.803
It's in Washington.
They'll verify everything I've told you.

23:17.970 --> 23:20.556
Excuse me for disturbing you so late,
Your Majesty.

23:20.639 --> 23:22.099
Telegram from Washington.

23:22.766 --> 23:23.892
Eyes only.

23:29.189 --> 23:31.316
This is not your handwriting, my Queen.

23:33.610 --> 23:35.487
Someone wishes you to spend your time...

23:35.571 --> 23:38.490
chatting with a White House
telephone operator?

23:39.074 --> 23:40.659
In the middle of the night.

23:41.910 --> 23:43.578
This maid...

23:43.662 --> 23:47.582
she's been telling me the most
incredible story about Agent Scott.

23:48.166 --> 23:50.043
She claims he's an imposter.

23:54.881 --> 23:57.509
- Guards!
- You've got to believe me.

23:57.592 --> 24:00.428
She's an accomplice
of that jewel thief we captured.

24:00.512 --> 24:02.389
Place this woman under arrest!

24:08.395 --> 24:09.479
After her!

24:24.160 --> 24:25.245
Follow me.

24:27.914 --> 24:28.998
Gentlemen!

26:38.627 --> 26:40.254
You're in no danger.

26:45.259 --> 26:47.469
- Wonder Woman?
- Yes.

26:50.681 --> 26:53.016
I must still be asleep.

26:53.850 --> 26:56.603
I thought you were a dream, a legend.

26:56.770 --> 26:58.897
I'm real. As real as you.

26:59.981 --> 27:03.318
If you want physical proof,
I suggest you examine your window.

27:03.860 --> 27:05.195
Let me help.

27:05.362 --> 27:07.405
- Majesty.
- Thank you.

27:15.580 --> 27:17.624
- You did that?
- Yes.

27:24.047 --> 27:26.925
Even seeing it with my own eyes,
I can't believe it.

27:28.051 --> 27:29.803
- So you're not a fable?
- No.

27:30.595 --> 27:32.389
Tell me, why did you come?

27:32.472 --> 27:35.183
Because there's no one else
that can help you.

27:35.350 --> 27:37.685
Before tonight, I would have believed you.

27:39.437 --> 27:42.690
Since my husband died, I've been alone...

27:43.149 --> 27:44.609
among many enemies.

27:45.318 --> 27:48.404
But now, I have help
from my native government.

27:48.780 --> 27:50.532
Agent Scott of the IADC.

27:51.533 --> 27:55.203
Your Highness, I'm afraid
that you've been badly deceived.

27:55.828 --> 27:59.624
The man you think is Agent Scott
is really Evan Robley.

28:01.250 --> 28:04.337
He tricked you into giving away
your secret about the jewels...

28:04.420 --> 28:08.257
and he tricked you into imprisoning
the real agent sent to protect you.

28:08.591 --> 28:12.887
Some maid told me the same thing earlier.
But I refused to listen.

28:13.346 --> 28:15.765
That poor man. We must release him.

28:16.015 --> 28:17.350
We can't now.

28:17.433 --> 28:18.851
If we do...

28:18.935 --> 28:22.480
they'll know someone else on the inside
of the consulate is on your side.

28:22.563 --> 28:24.524
You'd really be in danger then.

28:25.399 --> 28:27.485
Steve Trevor is safe where he is.

28:27.568 --> 28:30.696
He's an agent.
He'll understand what we're doing.

28:32.698 --> 28:37.078
Robley seemed such a pleasing man.

28:39.246 --> 28:44.001
I think that he was just
taking advantage of your vulnerability.

28:47.004 --> 28:49.590
Now we have to protect your jewels.

28:49.673 --> 28:52.426
- How?
- Robley knows where you've hidden them.

28:52.510 --> 28:54.762
How can he? I've told no one.

28:54.845 --> 28:56.013
You didn't have to.

28:56.097 --> 28:58.390
When he came to see you earlier
as Count Diaz...

28:58.474 --> 29:00.559
he watched you very closely.

29:00.893 --> 29:04.980
In your distress, you gave away
their location without even knowing it.

29:05.064 --> 29:08.692
Men like that train themselves
to notice every indication.

29:09.944 --> 29:13.906
They're hidden in the safe behind
the coat of arms in your sitting room.

29:14.198 --> 29:15.783
How did you know that?

29:16.533 --> 29:18.452
I thought I'd been so clever.

29:18.744 --> 29:20.579
There are no clever victims.

29:22.289 --> 29:25.584
Don't worry about that.
I'll keep them safe for you.

29:26.085 --> 29:29.797
- I'm glad you're on my side.
- Me, too. Let's go and get your jewels.

29:42.226 --> 29:44.019
They're gone. Stolen.

29:45.270 --> 29:46.813
We're too late.

29:48.023 --> 29:49.775
My enemies have won.

29:53.362 --> 29:55.364
One battle doesn't win a war.

30:09.586 --> 30:11.713
I must remember to put up a sign:

30:11.797 --> 30:14.090
"Please knock before trespassing. "

30:26.102 --> 30:28.313
What do I do? Salute?

30:29.356 --> 30:30.857
Do thieves salute?

30:32.150 --> 30:36.029
If there is something worse than
a trespasser, it must be a name-caller.

30:36.112 --> 30:38.573
To liberty and to beauty.

30:42.160 --> 30:44.287
How about some champagne?

30:44.370 --> 30:46.039
Then you can toast me.

30:46.206 --> 30:48.458
How long have you been
in this room, Robley?

30:48.541 --> 30:52.378
About 32 hours. I checked in
yesterday at 2:30 a. m., Paris time.

30:52.545 --> 30:54.464
I'm only interested in tonight.

30:54.547 --> 30:58.468
- Am I suspected of something?
- Of stealing the Queen's jewels.

30:58.843 --> 31:02.263
I really don't have to answer
such a discourteous insinuation.

31:02.597 --> 31:03.723
Excuse me.

31:04.849 --> 31:07.435
I did not steal the royal jewels.

31:08.019 --> 31:09.937
You're playing games with me.

31:10.104 --> 31:11.105
Games?

31:18.154 --> 31:20.198
Repeat that, please, if you can.

31:20.740 --> 31:23.743
I did not steal the royal jewels.

31:31.709 --> 31:33.878
My apologies, Mr. Robley.

31:34.503 --> 31:35.796
It's quite all right.

31:35.880 --> 31:39.133
As a matter of fact,
you're welcome to search my rooms.

31:40.927 --> 31:43.512
Maybe I didn't ask you the right question.

31:43.596 --> 31:45.389
It's a distinct possibility.

31:45.598 --> 31:46.766
Must I?

31:46.849 --> 31:49.435
I hate the idea of being forced
into doing anything.

31:49.518 --> 31:51.645
It's my criminal nature, I suppose.

31:52.480 --> 31:54.440
May I have some more champagne?

31:55.566 --> 31:57.401
- Please?
- Please.

32:07.536 --> 32:10.414
I should have asked you if you knew
where they were hidden.

32:10.497 --> 32:12.750
I would have told you
they were most probably...

32:12.833 --> 32:14.293
in the Consulate security room.

32:14.376 --> 32:15.419
Go on.

32:15.794 --> 32:17.796
As you undoubtedly know...

32:17.922 --> 32:20.549
stealing is the only work I'm trained to do.

32:20.633 --> 32:24.219
May I say that none of
my other professional endeavors...

32:24.720 --> 32:29.433
have introduced me
to such a charming investigator.

32:33.103 --> 32:35.481
What a pity. It was all for nothing.

32:35.856 --> 32:38.358
- You call these nothing?
- A slight exaggeration.

32:38.442 --> 32:41.236
Actually, they're worth,
in these inflationary times...

32:41.320 --> 32:43.155
about $83.

32:46.825 --> 32:49.369
I asked you if you'd stolen
the royal jewels.

32:49.453 --> 32:52.706
- You're saying these are fakes?
- Or phonies, if you prefer.

32:53.332 --> 32:55.000
Cheap imitations.

32:55.083 --> 32:56.293
Why did you bother?

32:56.376 --> 32:58.503
I was tricked. So were you.

33:01.548 --> 33:04.092
It's Queen Kathryn who's been tricked.

33:04.176 --> 33:06.094
She's the one who's gonna suffer.

33:06.178 --> 33:09.306
Whoever stole the real jewels
has stolen her throne as well.

33:09.389 --> 33:10.974
She'll be forced to abdicate.

33:11.058 --> 33:12.642
- Really?
- Yes.

33:12.726 --> 33:14.352
She won't give up without a fight.

33:14.436 --> 33:17.230
They don't call her
the wild shamrock for nothing.

33:17.564 --> 33:21.610
We have to devise a plan to get
those jewels back before the reception.

33:21.693 --> 33:23.695
- Do you know where they are?
- I'm not sure.

33:23.778 --> 33:26.781
The real jewels were stolen
long before I stole the fakes.

33:27.157 --> 33:28.241
Who do you suspect?

33:28.325 --> 33:30.952
I think I can prove who took them,
on two conditions.

33:31.036 --> 33:34.414
First, you must keep yourself
hidden for about five minutes.

33:34.497 --> 33:35.915
- And...
- Second?

33:36.833 --> 33:38.793
A bothersome detail, actually.

33:38.877 --> 33:39.961
Amnesty.

33:40.378 --> 33:41.546
Amnesty?

33:42.422 --> 33:44.549
Why should you be given amnesty?

33:44.632 --> 33:47.594
Because if I'm not,
I'll only have to escape.

33:47.677 --> 33:52.432
I'm growing very weary of wearing
disguise after ridiculous disguise.

33:53.850 --> 33:57.979
I have a few friends at the IADC
I might be able to arrange it for you.

33:58.062 --> 33:59.397
I'm sure you can.

33:59.481 --> 34:02.192
Meanwhile, to show my good faith...

34:02.483 --> 34:04.819
I'll just invite my suspect in here.

34:16.496 --> 34:19.083
You're supposed to be
on your way to the airport.

34:19.167 --> 34:21.793
I ran into a slight problem,
Mr. Ambassador.

34:21.878 --> 34:24.839
The jewels that you hired me to steal
are fakes.

34:25.757 --> 34:28.885
What does it matter? You weren't stealing
on a commission basis.

34:28.967 --> 34:32.013
Somehow, I feel short-changed.

34:32.179 --> 34:34.849
I imagine your co-conspirators
will feel the same way...

34:34.931 --> 34:38.186
if they knew you had appropriated
the jewels for yourself.

34:39.103 --> 34:41.981
Then I would suggest
that you don't inform them.

34:43.024 --> 34:45.525
You did your job
and were generously paid for it.

34:45.610 --> 34:47.902
I suggest you forget the rest.

34:47.987 --> 34:51.239
That is, if you value your life.

34:52.241 --> 34:54.493
Of course, Mr. Ambassador.

34:54.577 --> 34:57.038
If you put it that way, I'm sorry I asked.

34:57.747 --> 35:01.917
Good. I'd hate to see you neutralized,
Mr. Robley.

35:02.001 --> 35:04.795
We may find other occasions
to do business together.

35:04.879 --> 35:06.005
Hopefully.

35:06.964 --> 35:10.134
I imagine you're keeping the jewels
in the security room.

35:10.301 --> 35:13.929
I thought your dangerous attack
of curiosity had been cured.

35:15.055 --> 35:18.767
A momentary relapse. My apologies.
It's none of my concern.

35:20.019 --> 35:22.813
Now you're getting the picture.
Goodbye, Mr. Robley.

35:22.897 --> 35:24.273
Look after your health.

35:24.356 --> 35:25.941
How very thoughtful. Thank you.

35:26.025 --> 35:30.446
An immediate change of climate
is a prescription that should do wonders...

35:30.571 --> 35:32.031
for your longevity.

35:32.406 --> 35:33.991
Color me vanished.

35:42.499 --> 35:45.377
Mr. Robley, you make
an excellent detective.

35:45.461 --> 35:47.212
Please, there's no need to be cruel.

35:47.296 --> 35:49.631
At least I know who's behind this now.
Thank you.

35:49.715 --> 35:53.844
You're welcome. He undoubtedly,
has the jewels in the security room.

35:54.178 --> 35:56.013
It's the only logical place.

35:56.263 --> 35:59.266
He wouldn't risk moving them
from the consulate.

35:59.933 --> 36:02.269
The security room
provides maximum protection.

36:02.352 --> 36:04.229
Maximum is an understatement.

36:04.396 --> 36:07.107
That vault makes Fort Knox
look like a piggy bank.

36:07.190 --> 36:09.401
The entire floor is an electronic alarm.

36:09.484 --> 36:13.155
The slightest pressure on it
will fill the room with deadly gas.

36:13.739 --> 36:16.825
How could you have possibly
expected to get in there?

36:16.992 --> 36:19.786
- Did you have a plan-
- Of course I have a plan.

36:19.870 --> 36:22.164
Good. I will help you carry it off.

36:22.247 --> 36:26.376
Better still, we release Steve Trevor
and there'll be three of us.

36:26.501 --> 36:29.045
All for one and all that.
The three musketeers.

36:29.129 --> 36:32.173
My fellow musketeer,
there is a slight detail.

36:32.257 --> 36:36.261
The floor of the vault could blow
all three of us to kingdom come.

36:43.018 --> 36:45.103
See for yourself. They're gone.

36:46.688 --> 36:48.565
I am devastated, Your Majesty.

36:50.608 --> 36:52.027
How may I help?

36:52.777 --> 36:54.738
There's nothing you can do now.

36:55.822 --> 36:58.491
Soon the world will witness my shame.

37:00.743 --> 37:03.621
If only there were some way
to spare you this ordeal.

37:05.373 --> 37:07.959
Perhaps if I announced your abdication.

37:09.210 --> 37:11.921
I have more courage than you think,
Ambassador.

37:12.881 --> 37:15.466
I'm not a blue-blood in the purest sense.

37:16.634 --> 37:19.929
True, my grandfather came
to this country in steerage.

37:20.346 --> 37:22.181
He left my mother in London.

37:22.265 --> 37:24.517
My father always had to work hard.

37:25.018 --> 37:29.731
He began life with what was known
as "an Irish teaspoon. " A shovel.

37:32.150 --> 37:34.652
Since I never expected to have a throne...

37:35.903 --> 37:38.072
the thought of abdication is...

37:38.614 --> 37:40.950
less of a trauma than you might think.

37:41.659 --> 37:44.745
- I, Your Majesty? What-
- Not necessarily you, Ambassador.

37:44.829 --> 37:46.831
I merely meant to point out that...

37:47.456 --> 37:50.293
though I haven't
experienced poverty personally...

37:51.210 --> 37:53.170
it is certainly no stranger to me.

37:54.255 --> 37:56.173
I don't fear it for myself.

37:58.134 --> 38:01.595
I do, however, fear it for my people.

38:03.222 --> 38:05.307
The Americans, Your Majesty?

38:07.893 --> 38:10.729
My people are the Malakans.

38:13.274 --> 38:14.733
Yes, of course.

38:15.860 --> 38:17.945
Please, if you... Leave me now.

38:18.946 --> 38:22.491
I must think what my husband
would have wanted me to do.

38:25.953 --> 38:29.873
Resigning now would save you much grief.

38:30.082 --> 38:32.793
We both know that you are innocent...

38:33.502 --> 38:35.963
but the facts do appear otherwise.

38:36.046 --> 38:37.798
Why torture yourself?

38:38.215 --> 38:40.175
And why torture those of us...

38:41.010 --> 38:42.970
who love and admire you?

38:44.596 --> 38:45.931
Thank you.

38:50.978 --> 38:52.479
Ambassador Orrick.

38:53.647 --> 38:57.317
I realize my enemies
would stop at nothing to dethrone me.

38:58.277 --> 39:00.237
When they get my head...

39:00.821 --> 39:03.031
they will be getting the head of a queen.

39:18.463 --> 39:20.549
Well, musketeers, this is it.

39:20.632 --> 39:22.384
One of us has to stand guard.

39:22.467 --> 39:25.762
And needless to say,
an interruption could be fatal.

39:25.971 --> 39:29.307
You know the area.
She's got the power. I'll cover for you.

39:29.391 --> 39:30.892
Thanks, Steve.

40:06.594 --> 40:10.348
You say the slightest pressure
on this floor would release a lethal gas?

40:10.431 --> 40:15.270
If we drop a hair on this floor,
it will kill us both in half a second.

40:15.395 --> 40:17.897
Then this trip will have to be by air.

40:34.706 --> 40:36.165
Tie this off.

40:36.249 --> 40:38.501
- And hold on to it, tight.
- Right.

40:57.645 --> 40:59.981
Now lower me.

41:01.983 --> 41:04.151
No, wait! Stop. Not that much.

41:05.486 --> 41:06.654
Sorry.

41:07.738 --> 41:09.782
Don't be sorry, just pull.

41:13.744 --> 41:14.912
Slowly.

41:18.207 --> 41:20.417
Stop. That's it. Now tie it off.

41:28.259 --> 41:29.760
I know the combination.

41:29.843 --> 41:31.095
So do I.

41:34.598 --> 41:37.393
I'm gonna throw it to you. Catch.

42:01.625 --> 42:03.001
Over there.

42:03.168 --> 42:05.921
What sort of circus performance is this?

42:07.130 --> 42:09.341
You should have left
when you could, Robley.

42:09.424 --> 42:12.261
I warned you about your curiosity.

42:12.344 --> 42:14.680
You're not the only one
who knew the area, Robley.

42:14.763 --> 42:16.348
Orrick knew it, too.

42:16.431 --> 42:18.350
Get down there, Robley.

42:18.433 --> 42:20.018
Come, now, Mr. Ambassador.

42:20.102 --> 42:23.563
I'm sure you don't want
my messy footprints on your shiny floor.

42:23.814 --> 42:25.774
You wanted to see the safe, Robley.

42:26.525 --> 42:28.610
There it is. Down!

42:31.196 --> 42:34.783
Mr. Trevor, you can join the act, too.

42:52.634 --> 42:54.511
Was I right about the jewels?

42:55.095 --> 42:56.471
Yes, you were.

42:59.349 --> 43:01.643
You know, if you play your cards right...

43:02.185 --> 43:05.021
I think you can talk me into
a permanent partnership.

43:05.605 --> 43:07.107
Right, Robley.

43:22.247 --> 43:24.165
Where did you... How did you...

43:24.249 --> 43:25.458
Not now.

43:25.541 --> 43:28.002
No one is more deserving of this...

43:28.461 --> 43:30.797
than you, Your Majesty.

43:32.173 --> 43:34.634
This is a very private coronation.

43:35.301 --> 43:38.262
Each one of you
in your own way is responsible for it.

43:38.971 --> 43:41.516
And my apologies to you, Mr. Trevor.

43:41.974 --> 43:44.352
It comes with the territory, Your Majesty.

43:48.356 --> 43:50.024
I must tell you...

43:50.525 --> 43:52.693
it was long my husband's dream...

43:52.819 --> 43:55.363
that our two countries
be united in friendship.

43:56.364 --> 43:58.699
You have helped
make that dream come true.

43:59.909 --> 44:01.285
Thank you.

44:18.886 --> 44:21.472
Come on, Steve. Get me out of this.

44:21.639 --> 44:23.849
We'll blow our cover.

44:23.933 --> 44:27.686
My favorite maid.
Diana, I thought you had forsaken me.

44:27.770 --> 44:29.647
I think I'll have some champagne-

44:29.730 --> 44:32.066
Since you'll no longer be working
as a thief...

44:32.149 --> 44:33.776
why not try your hand as a waiter?

44:33.859 --> 44:36.237
Diana is an agent for the IADC.

45:14.316 --> 45:15.651
Your Majesty.

45:19.321 --> 45:20.989
How did you get in here?

45:21.698 --> 45:24.826
They've been asking that question
ever since I can remember.

45:25.994 --> 45:28.246
I feel neglected, Your Majesty.

45:28.497 --> 45:31.875
I needed some way
to attract your royal attention.

45:32.459 --> 45:36.963
I should've thought anonymity was
a part of your stock in trade, Mr. Robley.

45:37.130 --> 45:39.925
The unfortunate truth is
I no longer have a trade.

45:40.008 --> 45:42.385
Frankly, I hold you responsible.

45:43.053 --> 45:45.138
Must I drink alone, Your Majesty?

45:58.610 --> 46:03.031
I hope you won't feel neglected
if I don't offer you a knighthood?

46:03.114 --> 46:06.576
A simple "thank you" would do nicely,
Your Majesty.

46:06.910 --> 46:09.579
Exactly what am I supposed
to be grateful to you for?

46:09.662 --> 46:13.249
There's Gregory Orrick, whose downfall
I most certainly hastened.

46:13.958 --> 46:17.128
Wonder Woman and the IADC
had something to do with that.

46:17.212 --> 46:18.254
Of course.

46:18.338 --> 46:22.342
Would they have appeared at all
if I had not provided the impetus?

46:22.842 --> 46:24.844
Your logic amazes me.

46:25.178 --> 46:26.971
Then consider this.

46:27.639 --> 46:30.391
Where are they now
when you're in real danger?

46:32.518 --> 46:33.645
Danger?

46:34.729 --> 46:36.147
Of being kissed.

46:39.150 --> 46:41.819
I'd rather give you a knighthood,
Mr. Robley.

46:41.944 --> 46:43.571
That's what you say now.

46:43.654 --> 46:46.908
As we become better acquainted,
you may change your mind.

46:47.116 --> 46:49.327
Will that be all, Mr. Robley?

46:50.369 --> 46:52.038
Don't you mean Sir Evan?

46:53.247 --> 46:56.834
You truly are everything
they say about you.

46:57.168 --> 46:59.253
And willing to be more.

47:01.172 --> 47:03.007
I could use an ambassador.

47:11.849 --> 47:13.809
Wonder Woman would have loved this.

47:14.852 --> 47:16.520
Steve, she's...

47:17.188 --> 47:20.483
She's probably seen it all before
with the original cast.

48:04.485 --> 48:05.611
