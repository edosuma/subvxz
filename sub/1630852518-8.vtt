00:27.527 --> 00:29.404
Guess what, gang!

00:29.487 --> 00:32.282
Tonight is family game night!

00:33.950 --> 00:35.285
Aw, Dad!

00:35.368 --> 00:37.996
Game night is always a disaster.

00:38.079 --> 00:40.582
What? Disaster? Wha…?

00:40.665 --> 00:42.167
Nuh-uh.

00:43.585 --> 00:45.962


00:47.005 --> 00:49.841
It's a rhino! Come on!

00:49.924 --> 00:53.261
-A rhino?

00:53.344 --> 00:55.597
Don't yell at your mother!

01:00.101 --> 01:02.729
I'm a positive ion!

01:02.812 --> 01:05.899
-Positive? Ions are not--

01:05.982 --> 01:07.525
Don't yell at your sister!

01:08.526 --> 01:12.322
Pay up, losers, cos that street is mine!

01:17.494 --> 01:19.412
Must be family game night.

01:20.789 --> 01:23.416
OK, it's not always
rainbows and sunshine,

01:23.500 --> 01:26.461
but it brings this family together.

01:26.544 --> 01:28.088
Dad, it's a dumpster fire.

01:28.171 --> 01:32.467
But the nightmare ends tonight,
because it's my turn to pick the game!

01:34.594 --> 01:37.013
No groans. Fun!

01:37.096 --> 01:39.182
And what are we gonna play, sweetheart?

01:39.265 --> 01:42.101
It's a surprise.

01:47.816 --> 01:50.443
Welcome to Johnny's game night!

01:50.527 --> 01:52.237
I had Susan and Mary's
construction drones

01:52.320 --> 01:54.489
design the game while we were
at work, school, and detention.

01:54.572 --> 01:57.033
Detention?
Why did you have detention?

01:57.117 --> 01:59.077
But what is the game, you ask?

01:59.160 --> 02:01.830
-You've heard of escape rooms, right?
-Yes.

02:01.913 --> 02:02.872
No.

02:02.956 --> 02:05.667
Well, welcome to the escape house!

02:05.750 --> 02:09.712
Where you have to solve puzzles
to get out of the house, or else.

02:09.796 --> 02:11.881
Ooh, that sounds like fun.

02:11.965 --> 02:13.758
No. It sounds easy.

02:13.842 --> 02:16.928
Johnny, we invented
the construction drones.

02:17.011 --> 02:19.097
Which means they'll do what we say,

02:19.180 --> 02:22.433
like open the door so we can win!

02:30.692 --> 02:32.402
Now I'm intrigued.

02:32.485 --> 02:36.281
And as long as the house gets returned
to normal when we're done,

02:36.364 --> 02:38.783
I say let's play!

02:38.867 --> 02:39.951
<i> Test family.</i>

02:40.034 --> 02:44.789
<i>Can you escape the house,</i>
<i>or will you be trapped forever?</i>

02:44.873 --> 02:47.417
Clues to get out are in every room,
so team up!

02:49.460 --> 02:50.879
Let's go!

02:54.966 --> 02:57.385
OK. My room is dark and different.

02:57.468 --> 02:59.095
<i> Choose your doors carefully.</i>

02:59.178 --> 03:02.223
<i>The correct door will</i>
<i>advance you to another room.</i>

03:02.307 --> 03:05.852
<i>The wrong door</i>
<i>will send you to your doom.</i>

03:05.935 --> 03:08.980
Cool. So, what door should we pick?

03:10.064 --> 03:11.983
I don't know, I'm so excited!

03:16.821 --> 03:20.325
<i> In the lab, you must find</i>
<i>the hidden message to escape.</i>

03:20.408 --> 03:24.287
How c-c-can we find anything
when it's so c-c-cold?

03:24.370 --> 03:26.414
<i>The cold is part of the game.</i>

03:26.497 --> 03:29.542
And why is that mirror here?

03:29.626 --> 03:32.378
<i>The mirror is part of the game.</i>

03:32.462 --> 03:34.631
And that chicken mug on the console?

03:34.714 --> 03:37.133
<i>Oh, is that where I left it?</i>

03:37.216 --> 03:38.760
-
-Oh!

03:38.843 --> 03:41.346
Let's just f-find the s-secret message

03:41.429 --> 03:43.723
and escape this house and game night.

03:43.806 --> 03:47.185
But it's freezing
and I can see my breath, and…

03:48.311 --> 03:49.354
Wait.

03:51.147 --> 03:52.106
"Duck?"

03:55.068 --> 03:57.946
Johnny's escape house
is actually dangerous?

03:58.029 --> 04:02.283
<i> Correct. And if you fail again,</i>
<i>you will never escape.</i>

04:02.367 --> 04:04.285
<i>Ha. Ha ha. Ha.</i>

04:04.369 --> 04:06.621
Oh, I'm getting a bad feeling about this.

04:12.168 --> 04:16.256
C'mon! It's not like the wrong door
is actually gonna send us to our doom.

04:16.339 --> 04:18.758
-Pick one!
-Let's go… green!

04:20.927 --> 04:22.262
Is that a…

04:22.345 --> 04:23.763
tennis ball machine?

04:23.846 --> 04:25.139
That's on fire!

04:27.934 --> 04:31.312
FYI… That's a bad door.

04:31.396 --> 04:34.399
What drones did you use
to build the escape house?

04:34.482 --> 04:35.650
The new ones with the red eyes.

04:35.733 --> 04:36.859
They were super helpful.

04:37.485 --> 04:40.196
Johnny, those are the evil drones!

04:40.280 --> 04:42.156
Um, I have a question.

04:42.240 --> 04:44.284
Why do you even have evil drones?

04:44.367 --> 04:46.828
They got infected by a cyber-virus,

04:46.911 --> 04:49.330
but Mary didn't have the heart
to disassemble them.

04:49.414 --> 04:51.624
I just needed more time
to reprogram them!

04:51.708 --> 04:53.751
And now we're all gonna die!

04:55.837 --> 04:57.547
And why are you frozen like that?

04:57.630 --> 04:59.090
Mom and Dad!

04:59.716 --> 05:01.801
<i> Left hand, green.</i>

05:03.303 --> 05:07.015
<i>Survive five more turns</i>
<i>to open your escape path.</i>

05:07.098 --> 05:09.183
<i>Right foot, red.</i>

05:11.019 --> 05:12.186
Ooh…

05:12.270 --> 05:14.147
<i>-Incorrect.</i>

05:16.190 --> 05:19.485
That lava looks so real.

05:19.569 --> 05:22.447
Ooh! I hope we don't fall in.

05:22.530 --> 05:23.781
Whoa!

05:23.865 --> 05:25.616
-Whoa!

05:25.700 --> 05:28.411
OK, me and Dukey
will find Mom and Dad

05:28.494 --> 05:29.871
and somehow get out of the house.

05:29.954 --> 05:31.539
And we'll get to the lab…

05:31.622 --> 05:33.875
And somehow shut down the evil drones.

05:34.751 --> 05:36.753
-Yes!
-<i> But to get to the lab,</i>

05:36.836 --> 05:40.006
<i>you will have to get out</i>
<i>of this room first.</i>

05:41.924 --> 05:43.926
<i>Ha ha. Ha ha ha ha.</i>

05:45.344 --> 05:47.263
We'll take the emergency elevator.

05:47.346 --> 05:49.640
<i> Oh, shoot. We forgot about that.</i>

05:50.641 --> 05:53.269
And that leaves us with this.

05:55.104 --> 05:57.190
-Jump, dog!

05:57.273 --> 05:58.649
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

06:00.943 --> 06:03.905
<i> Last turn. Right foot, blue.</i>

06:05.740 --> 06:07.408
Uh-oh, honey!

06:07.492 --> 06:10.828
It looks like we're gonna
fall in the lava!

06:10.912 --> 06:12.830
Oh no!

06:12.914 --> 06:14.749
<i>Three more seconds.</i>

06:14.832 --> 06:16.042
<i>Two… one…</i>

06:17.335 --> 06:18.252
Johnny!

06:18.336 --> 06:20.379
This is the best game night ever!

06:20.463 --> 06:23.091
-Yeah, it might not be.
-What happens now?

06:25.176 --> 06:26.719
Let's try that.

06:27.970 --> 06:30.098
Whoa-ho-ho!

06:31.557 --> 06:33.601
Which goes down to the basement.

06:33.684 --> 06:37.438
-Ooh! What deadly thing is this?

06:37.522 --> 06:39.190
<i> Musical Mayhem.</i>

06:39.273 --> 06:42.777
<i>Repeat the notes that are played</i>
<i>to free yourself.</i>

06:42.860 --> 06:45.863
<i>Play them incorrectly, and…</i>

06:47.115 --> 06:48.825
-Fun!
-Oh, no.

06:48.908 --> 06:53.037
Step back, gang, and watch the master.

07:00.503 --> 07:03.589
Uh-oh, Hugh. Here come the spikes!

07:03.673 --> 07:06.592
Uh-oh! We're all gonna die!

07:06.676 --> 07:09.053
We<i> are</i> all gonna die.

07:10.054 --> 07:11.556
<i> Why are you in the lab?</i>

07:11.639 --> 07:14.517
<i>You should be getting out of the house.</i>

07:14.600 --> 07:17.395
Because we know
you're in here somewhere.

07:18.062 --> 07:20.690
<i>No, we're not. We're not here.</i>

07:20.773 --> 07:23.401
The lab is the only place
that can power something

07:23.484 --> 07:26.446
as deadly and stupid as an escape house.

07:26.529 --> 07:29.240
<i> Well, you're stupid.</i>

07:29.323 --> 07:31.117
They must have hacked
the command center

07:31.200 --> 07:33.953
and created a satellite
in close proximity.

07:34.036 --> 07:35.037
<i>No, we didn't.</i>

07:35.121 --> 07:36.622
<i>We're… outside.</i>

07:36.706 --> 07:39.041
<i>In the back… yard.</i>

07:40.710 --> 07:44.589
Shut down the escape house now,
or I release an electro-pulse

07:44.672 --> 07:46.841
that will cause full cyber-collapse.

07:46.924 --> 07:49.302
<i>Which will cause me</i>
<i>to fall on this button,</i>

07:49.385 --> 07:53.139
<i>starting the escape house</i>
<i>self-destruction mode.</i>

07:53.222 --> 07:57.101
Then we'll just slide to safety
in the lab escape chute.

07:58.186 --> 08:00.897
<i>We didn't forget about that one.</i>

08:00.980 --> 08:02.482
Man, they are evil!

08:02.565 --> 08:06.736
<i>So, how are you going</i>
<i>to get out of this one?</i>

08:06.819 --> 08:09.238
<i>Ha ha. Ha ha. Ha.</i>

08:11.532 --> 08:14.410
-Oh, so close, hon!

08:15.077 --> 08:17.455
-Your turn, Johnny.

08:24.712 --> 08:26.380
I can't remember all that!

08:26.464 --> 08:27.673
Please do.

08:27.757 --> 08:30.927
And hurry, before we're…

08:32.345 --> 08:34.764
Well, there's always one thing
I've been good at.

08:38.643 --> 08:40.353
-You did it!

08:41.687 --> 08:44.941
-Ooh! Big staircase.
-I wonder where they go.

08:46.234 --> 08:47.777
The lab!

08:47.860 --> 08:50.863
Where the girls are
in some kind of stand-off

08:50.947 --> 08:53.699
with construction drones
with menacing red eyes.

08:53.783 --> 08:58.579
<i>Welcome, Test family,</i>
<i>to your final challenge.</i>

08:59.372 --> 09:00.998
And what's that?

09:01.082 --> 09:02.917
We can't shut them down and escape.

09:03.000 --> 09:04.669
Because that will cause them to collapse

09:04.752 --> 09:07.588
and press the escape house
self-destruction button.

09:09.632 --> 09:10.883
What?

09:11.509 --> 09:13.803
Best game night ever!

09:14.679 --> 09:16.639
You said they turned evil
when they got a virus,

09:16.722 --> 09:20.601
so can't cyber antibodies
make them nice again?

09:20.685 --> 09:23.479
Yeah, then they won't "blow up" the house.

09:24.814 --> 09:28.651
Wait. If I can wirelessly erase
their evil OS in a nanosecond,

09:28.734 --> 09:32.363
a hyperaccelerated upload
of an older OS could make them nice.

09:32.446 --> 09:36.450
<i>Right, and where are you going</i>
<i>to get that kind of surge?</i>

09:36.534 --> 09:38.869
<i>Ha ha. Ha. Ha.</i>

09:40.496 --> 09:41.831
<i>Uh-oh.</i>

09:44.917 --> 09:46.544
And… send!

09:52.883 --> 09:56.095
<i> Whoa. I feel weird.</i>
<i>What happened?</i>

09:56.178 --> 09:58.973
A virus turned you evil and you were
about to destroy the house.

09:59.056 --> 10:00.975
With us in it!

10:01.058 --> 10:02.476
But we freed you.

10:02.560 --> 10:04.562
<i>Oh, that's a relief.</i>

10:07.189 --> 10:09.233
And he hit the self-destruct button.

10:09.317 --> 10:10.901
And there's no way out!

10:10.985 --> 10:12.612
This is your fault, Johnny!

10:12.695 --> 10:14.947
Again, who makes evil drones?

10:15.031 --> 10:16.866
Stop! This is supposed to be fun!

10:16.949 --> 10:18.826
This is so not fun, Mom!

10:18.909 --> 10:20.286
Don't yell at your mother!

10:22.747 --> 10:25.791
And who invites a dog
to game night anyway?

10:27.960 --> 10:28.836
Woof?

10:28.919 --> 10:31.714
Wait! The evil drones
blocked the escape hatch,

10:31.797 --> 10:33.716
but the nice drones can unblock it!

10:33.799 --> 10:35.926
<i>He's right. Stand back!</i>

10:38.471 --> 10:39.388
<i>After you.</i>

10:40.014 --> 10:41.390
Go!

10:44.769 --> 10:46.604
We escaped the house!

10:46.687 --> 10:50.608
And I don't think we've ever
been closer as a family.

10:50.691 --> 10:52.943
Best family game night ev…

10:59.784 --> 11:01.535
Family game night, huh?

11:02.244 --> 11:04.997
-Uh…

11:06.374 --> 11:08.876
I figure they're out
for two, three hours, tops.

11:08.959 --> 11:10.711
Can you guys fix it in time?

11:11.379 --> 11:13.673
<i> No problemo.</i>

11:14.256 --> 11:16.634
That<i> was</i> a fun game night.

11:16.717 --> 11:18.594
Best ever!
