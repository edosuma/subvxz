00:01.566 --> 00:03.090
<i>Previously on "Reginald the Vampire"...</i>

00:03.177 --> 00:04.961
<i>I feel like
there's something</i>

00:05.048 --> 00:06.354
<i>that you're not telling me.</i>

00:06.441 --> 00:08.443
<i>You made her go.</i>

00:08.530 --> 00:10.140
I just put a different
thought in her head.

00:10.227 --> 00:11.968
Sarah ever gonna remember
that she likes me?

00:12.055 --> 00:13.448
Well, I didn't tell her
not to, man,

00:13.535 --> 00:15.189
but it's an inexact science.

00:15.276 --> 00:18.061
You were gonna feed on me.
How do I know I can trust you?

00:18.148 --> 00:20.194
I'm a vampire,
not an asshole.

00:20.281 --> 00:23.501
Drop your fangs,
bite, and drink.

00:23.588 --> 00:25.416
Make them forget
when it's over.

00:25.503 --> 00:26.896
<i>Exactly.</i>

00:26.983 --> 00:29.029
You killed my brother.

00:30.987 --> 00:32.815
If I'm gonna destroy Angela,

00:32.902 --> 00:34.382
<i>then I need to know everything
there is to know</i>

00:34.469 --> 00:35.383
<i>about her world.</i>

00:35.470 --> 00:36.819
Angel's Blood?

00:36.906 --> 00:37.950
What the hell
were you thinking,

00:38.038 --> 00:39.126
young soldier?

00:39.213 --> 00:41.041
I'm gonna rip your head off.

00:43.434 --> 00:45.567
Listen to me!

00:46.872 --> 00:49.527
My damn feet are on fire.

00:59.798 --> 01:01.322
I think I have
a superpower.

01:01.409 --> 01:02.540
How did you get in here?

01:02.627 --> 01:04.151
Sire bond.
What you feel, I feel.

01:04.238 --> 01:05.978
I know how it works.
I mean, how did you--

01:06.066 --> 01:07.937
I followed my vampire GPS
into the kitchen.

01:08.024 --> 01:09.286
And that's where I saw him.

01:09.373 --> 01:10.548
10 feet tall,
refrigerator with feet.

01:10.635 --> 01:12.942
The biggest, the baddest--
- Hang on.

01:13.029 --> 01:14.335
You got past Erich?
- He was doing the dishes.

01:14.422 --> 01:15.553
And?

01:15.640 --> 01:17.251
That's what I'm trying
to tell you.

01:17.338 --> 01:19.731
I glamoured him.
- That's impossible.

01:19.818 --> 01:20.950
I told him what to do,

01:21.037 --> 01:22.604
and he's doing
exactly what I said.

01:22.691 --> 01:24.736
Again, impossible.

01:24.823 --> 01:26.738
Two tablespoons butter,
two tablespoons flour,

01:26.825 --> 01:29.219
1 1/4 cups milk heated,
salt and pepper.

01:29.306 --> 01:30.829
You glamoured him
to make breakfast?

01:30.916 --> 01:32.222
I like breakfast.

01:32.309 --> 01:33.571
- You glamoured him.
- Yes.

01:33.658 --> 01:34.790
I feel like we're going
in circles here

01:34.877 --> 01:35.791
about my amazing superpower.

01:35.878 --> 01:36.835
That's impossible.

01:36.922 --> 01:38.489
Mike?
- You're alive.

01:38.576 --> 01:39.664
<i>You're</i> alive.

01:39.751 --> 01:40.622
Technically no one here
is alive.

01:40.709 --> 01:42.276
Not now.

01:42.363 --> 01:43.494
I woke up in a locked room
like somebody drugged me.

01:43.581 --> 01:44.974
Angela did.
She drugged me too.

01:45.061 --> 01:47.063
- Locked room?
- Coffin.

01:47.150 --> 01:48.586
I busted out
and tried to find you.

01:48.673 --> 01:50.327
Well, here I am.

01:50.414 --> 01:52.286
- You're not wearing shoes.
- Long story.

01:52.373 --> 01:54.201
I'm lucky to have feet.

01:57.029 --> 01:59.119
Come on.
- Okay, sorry.

01:59.206 --> 02:00.468
Almost done.

02:00.555 --> 02:02.122
What is it?

02:02.209 --> 02:03.601
She's here.

02:06.213 --> 02:08.040
Hate to see you leave
like this.

02:08.128 --> 02:10.217
Turns out we have
other plans.

02:10.304 --> 02:11.827
You could chase me
if you want.

02:11.914 --> 02:13.959
See how we do in the woods.

02:14.046 --> 02:15.178
Yeah, I'd like a shot
at that myself.

02:15.265 --> 02:17.267
Yeah.
Me too.

02:26.929 --> 02:29.105
<i>Listen to me.</i>

02:29.192 --> 02:31.499
<i>Listen to</i> me.

02:31.586 --> 02:35.807
Listen to me.

02:49.908 --> 02:52.302
The sauce is
very difficult to make.

03:14.368 --> 03:17.197
- Mm.
- Do you love it?

03:17.284 --> 03:19.242
Mmm.

03:23.028 --> 03:25.770
It's good.
So good.

03:36.477 --> 03:38.783
- Do I even like yogurt?
- I wouldn't.

03:38.870 --> 03:41.308
Non-fat yogurt
is a masculist plot

03:41.395 --> 03:44.572
pedaled to undermine women.

03:44.659 --> 03:46.138
Insulin growth
from the extra sugar

03:46.226 --> 03:47.531
causes spikes
in testosterone,

03:47.618 --> 03:49.794
which increases sexual desire.

03:49.881 --> 03:51.056
So yogurt companies
are trying

03:51.143 --> 03:52.710
to make women horny?

03:52.797 --> 03:54.799
It's about control.

03:54.886 --> 03:57.585
It can also cause
unwanted body hair.

04:02.154 --> 04:04.766
I feel like a puzzle
with pieces missing.

04:04.853 --> 04:07.464
Yesterday I washed a dish,

04:07.551 --> 04:09.640
couldn't remember what I ate
the night before.

04:09.727 --> 04:11.729
I delivered a rent check
to my landlady.

04:11.816 --> 04:13.383
She said I already
dropped one off.

04:13.470 --> 04:15.559
Oh, and then there's this.

04:15.646 --> 04:17.953
My bookmark is on page 75.

04:18.040 --> 04:20.608
But I don't remember
reading it.

04:20.695 --> 04:22.653
I have it on good authority
that the CIA

04:22.740 --> 04:25.308
is still performing
MK-Ultra tests.

04:25.395 --> 04:27.441
Those drugs do all sorts
of damage to people.

04:27.528 --> 04:29.051
Or this could be the result
of a sonic attack,

04:29.138 --> 04:30.748
like at the embassy in Cuba.

04:30.835 --> 04:34.361
Now <i>that</i> really messed
with people's minds.

04:34.448 --> 04:36.841
I work at the Slushy Shack
and read Gothic fiction.

04:36.928 --> 04:40.018
I'm too average to be the study
of a CIA experiment.

04:40.105 --> 04:42.325
True.

04:42.412 --> 04:45.415
Do you know of anyone who's
exhibiting similar symptoms?

04:45.502 --> 04:48.636
Relatives, friends?

04:48.723 --> 04:51.508
What's up, slush buddies?

04:51.595 --> 04:52.988
Coworkers?

04:54.990 --> 04:56.600
New scarf, Todd?

04:59.168 --> 05:02.040
Guess I'm trying
something new.

05:02.127 --> 05:05.305
See you out there.

05:05.392 --> 05:07.307
So Todd's
a pod person now.

05:07.394 --> 05:09.221
And you're experiencing
suspicious gaps in your memory

05:09.309 --> 05:10.962
due to some unknown intervention.

05:11.049 --> 05:13.965
Would you be willing
to give me a urine sample?

05:16.011 --> 05:18.883
<i>♪ Check it,
uh, uh, uh ♪</i>

05:18.970 --> 05:20.189
<i>♪ Yeah, I'm the OG ♪</i>

05:20.276 --> 05:22.583
<i>♪ Everybody here know me ♪</i>

05:22.670 --> 05:24.062
<i>♪ I make it rain
at the party ♪</i>

05:24.149 --> 05:27.414
<i>♪ OG, everybody here know me ♪</i>

05:27.501 --> 05:29.590
<i>♪ Everybody here know
I'm the OG ♪</i>

05:30.678 --> 05:31.896
How you doing, Reggie?

05:31.983 --> 05:33.420
Uh, great.
Never better.

05:33.507 --> 05:34.899
Fantastic, actually.

05:34.986 --> 05:37.424
Dead wrong.
Emphasis on dead.

05:37.511 --> 05:38.990
How can anything be wrong?

05:39.077 --> 05:40.296
I saved you
from a fiery death

05:40.383 --> 05:41.863
at the hands of your enemy.

05:41.950 --> 05:43.038
For which
I'm eternally grateful.

05:43.125 --> 05:44.779
But that's not why I'm here.

05:44.866 --> 05:46.520
I want to talk about
what happened before.

05:46.607 --> 05:48.565
Oh, like when I glamoured
the big, bad vampire?

05:48.652 --> 05:49.871
Yes.

05:49.958 --> 05:50.959
No, how did you do that?
I need to know.

05:51.046 --> 05:53.744
I don't know.

05:53.831 --> 05:55.572
You were screaming.

05:55.659 --> 05:57.182
Erich had me by the neck.

05:57.269 --> 05:59.271
And I reached out
and grabbed his arm.

05:59.359 --> 06:00.969
That was it.
Glamour time.

06:01.056 --> 06:03.232
No, no vampire
in the history of vampires--

06:03.319 --> 06:04.929
and it's a very long history--

06:05.016 --> 06:07.279
has ever been able
to glamour another vampire.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.978
I promise to use my powers
with responsibility.

06:10.065 --> 06:11.762
No, the only way
you're gonna use your power

06:11.849 --> 06:13.547
is if you keep it quiet.

06:13.634 --> 06:15.940
Counterpoint,
I was thinking

06:16.027 --> 06:17.507
I could use it
to further my reputation

06:17.594 --> 06:18.987
within the larger
vampire community.

06:19.074 --> 06:20.815
Maybe get me more respect.

06:20.902 --> 06:23.426
You know,
if Angela gets word of this,

06:23.513 --> 06:25.994
she will murder
everyone you've ever loved

06:26.081 --> 06:28.126
or known about
or even passed on the street.

06:28.213 --> 06:30.433
And then she will
get to work on you.

06:30.520 --> 06:32.740
And, look, that's just Angela.
All right?

06:32.827 --> 06:34.959
If word gets back to
Logan the Great and Mournful--

06:35.046 --> 06:37.658
- Who now?
- Never mind.

06:37.745 --> 06:39.442
No more glamouring
other vampires.

06:39.529 --> 06:40.965
And not a word
about this to anyone.

06:41.052 --> 06:42.706
Do you understand?

06:42.793 --> 06:45.230
Okay.

06:45.317 --> 06:47.798
No, I need to hear you
say it out loud.

06:47.885 --> 06:50.148
I promise not
to glamour another vampire

06:50.235 --> 06:53.064
or tell anyone.

06:53.151 --> 06:54.718
So I bolt to the kitchen.

06:54.805 --> 06:55.937
Time was running out
for Maurice.

06:56.024 --> 06:57.504
His feet are literally
in the fire.

06:57.591 --> 06:59.549
I'm his only hope.
- This is so cool.

06:59.636 --> 07:00.942
And who do I see
standing there?

07:01.029 --> 07:02.944
Erich, old-school vampire,

07:03.031 --> 07:04.554
fashionable kilt-wearer,

07:04.641 --> 07:05.816
but that's not the point
of the story.

07:05.903 --> 07:07.383
What happened next?

07:09.994 --> 07:12.562
I glamoured him, boom.

07:12.649 --> 07:15.565
- No, you didn't.
- I did!

07:15.652 --> 07:16.653
I told him
to make me breakfast,

07:16.740 --> 07:18.002
and he made me
a Croque-Madame.

07:18.089 --> 07:19.874
- No way.
- Mm-hmm.

07:19.961 --> 07:21.441
Door-to-door service
and everything.

07:21.528 --> 07:22.877
This is incredible.

07:22.964 --> 07:25.227
So where is Erich now?
- My apartment.

07:25.314 --> 07:27.098
I have him color-coding
my closet as we speak.

07:27.185 --> 07:29.536
Bodyguard and butler?

07:29.623 --> 07:31.146
I could use
a vampire like that.

07:33.714 --> 07:34.932
Thank you for choosing
the Slushy Shack.

07:35.019 --> 07:37.587
Come back soon.

07:37.674 --> 07:39.546
Great kid.

07:49.294 --> 07:52.515
How did Reginald
get you out of that coffin?

07:54.561 --> 07:57.912
Not a------- clue, man.

07:57.999 --> 07:59.870
But I mean, it's Reginald.

07:59.957 --> 08:02.177
Somehow he got
through that house,

08:02.264 --> 08:04.614
got to me.

08:04.701 --> 08:07.182
That little dude saved my life.

08:07.269 --> 08:09.445
Unbelievable.

08:18.062 --> 08:19.890
I come in peace.

08:19.977 --> 08:22.023
Great.
Can I get you anything?

08:22.110 --> 08:25.330
Coffee?
Angel's Blood?

08:25.417 --> 08:28.159
There must be a box of wooden
stakes around here somewhere.

08:28.246 --> 08:30.510
Hm, you're very funny.

08:30.597 --> 08:32.773
You better be here
to apologize.

08:32.860 --> 08:36.167
I don't apologize.
You know that.

08:36.254 --> 08:39.257
You want me dead.
I get that.

08:39.344 --> 08:41.129
But I also want you dead,

08:41.216 --> 08:45.176
which I'm sure
you can understand.

08:45.263 --> 08:48.745
But perhaps
we can set that aside

08:48.832 --> 08:51.748
given our history.

08:51.835 --> 08:53.358
How so?

08:53.445 --> 08:55.491
I have an idea
which I believe

08:55.578 --> 08:59.147
will benefit us both equally.

09:04.413 --> 09:06.720
<i>When we first met,</i>

09:06.807 --> 09:09.070
Sarah didn't judge me
by the way I looked.

09:09.157 --> 09:12.116
She wanted to know
the kind of music I like.

09:12.203 --> 09:14.249
Nu-soul and '90s hip-hop,
by the way.

09:16.207 --> 09:17.992
She asked me
what my favorite movie was,

09:18.079 --> 09:21.561
which "Mad Max
Beyond Thunderdome", obviously.

09:24.389 --> 09:26.827
She wanted to know me.

09:26.914 --> 09:29.307
No one ever did that.

09:29.394 --> 09:31.440
Not really, anyway.

09:34.225 --> 09:36.837
Everyone deserves
a second chance.

09:36.924 --> 09:39.013
Sarah and I deserve one too.

09:39.100 --> 09:42.190
You are very wise
in matters of the heart.

09:49.110 --> 09:52.983
Oh, my God.

09:54.811 --> 09:56.552
Listen to me.

09:58.815 --> 09:59.990
Whatever it is,
I didn't do it.

10:00.077 --> 10:01.209
I've been here
the whole time

10:01.296 --> 10:02.427
doing what
I'm supposed to be doing.

10:02.514 --> 10:03.733
Although if you have any--

10:03.820 --> 10:05.474
There's no reason
to be afraid.

10:05.561 --> 10:07.171
Agree to disagree.

10:07.258 --> 10:10.218
Reggie,
Angela and I made a deal.

10:10.305 --> 10:11.959
In order for you
to be accepted

10:12.046 --> 10:13.395
into the Midwest Chapter

10:13.482 --> 10:15.658
of the Vampire Council
of America,

10:15.745 --> 10:19.444
you, Reginald Andres,
will take part

10:19.531 --> 10:22.012
in the Vampiric Ability
and Potential Assessment,

10:22.099 --> 10:25.015
henceforth known
as The Assessment.

10:25.102 --> 10:27.670
Do I need a lawyer?

10:27.757 --> 10:30.673
Reginald, I need to scan
and send these off

10:30.760 --> 10:33.241
to Buenos Aires
by end of business.

10:33.328 --> 10:35.373
Uh, but, um--

10:35.460 --> 10:36.984
assessment for what?

10:37.071 --> 10:39.334
Suitability, of course.

10:39.421 --> 10:42.554
We can't just let anyone
join our ranks.

10:42.642 --> 10:44.469
That lists
assessment guidelines

10:44.556 --> 10:47.821
as well as your agreement
to take part in same.

10:47.908 --> 10:50.824
It's okay, Reggie.
She'll just need a signature.

10:50.911 --> 10:53.174
Oh, well,
I guess I can do that.

10:53.261 --> 10:55.393
In blood.

10:55.480 --> 10:57.178
Wait, what?

10:57.265 --> 10:59.528
- It'll just sting a little.
- Uh...

10:59.615 --> 11:02.052
Uh, okay.

11:09.494 --> 11:11.235
Great.

11:13.107 --> 11:16.197
Sign here.

11:16.284 --> 11:19.113
Here, here,

11:19.200 --> 11:21.898
here, and here.

11:27.338 --> 11:29.253
Hey, I have a question.

11:29.340 --> 11:32.039
Since you sired Maurice,

11:32.126 --> 11:34.171
and Maurice sired me,

11:34.258 --> 11:36.130
does that make you
my grandmother?

11:37.914 --> 11:39.873
Makes us family.

11:39.960 --> 11:42.136
Done.
That's your copy.

11:42.223 --> 11:45.879
Good luck,
and I wish you great success.

11:45.966 --> 11:47.968
Oh, oh--uh, Maurice?

11:48.055 --> 11:50.448
What happens
if I fail The Assessment?

11:50.535 --> 11:52.059
You die.

11:52.146 --> 11:54.278
But we'll talk
about all that tomorrow.

11:54.365 --> 11:57.238
Wait, what?

12:01.024 --> 12:03.287
Can I draw you a bath?

12:05.942 --> 12:07.291
Listen to me.

12:09.467 --> 12:12.383
You are no longer
my loyal manservant,

12:12.470 --> 12:15.343
personal chef,
and best friend.

12:17.214 --> 12:18.868
Go.

12:18.955 --> 12:21.392
Go far, far away from here

12:21.479 --> 12:24.439
and find a life better than
the one that you're living.

12:38.409 --> 12:40.716
I was waiting
for the right moment.

13:02.520 --> 13:05.088
So what happens if you pass
this Assessment deal?

13:05.175 --> 13:07.656
I become a bona fide member
of the vampire community.

13:07.743 --> 13:09.527
- That'd be good, right?
- Sure.

13:09.614 --> 13:11.529
You could make
new vampire friends.

13:11.616 --> 13:13.444
I bet they have
really cool social events

13:13.531 --> 13:15.359
like meet and greets.

13:19.886 --> 13:21.235
Talk to her.

13:21.322 --> 13:23.324
She liked you,
and she can like you again.

13:23.411 --> 13:25.717
But nothing's gonna change
if you don't talk.

13:25.805 --> 13:27.154
You're right.

13:27.241 --> 13:29.721
You're right.
You're absolutely right.

13:29.809 --> 13:32.246
Deep breaths.
Positive thoughts.

13:32.333 --> 13:34.248
I can talk.
I'm good at talking, right?

13:34.335 --> 13:36.337
- Sure.
- It's the iron in my golf bag.

13:36.424 --> 13:37.642
Arrow in my quiver.

13:37.729 --> 13:38.992
Except sometimes,
when I get nervous,

13:39.079 --> 13:40.080
I can't stop talking.

13:40.167 --> 13:42.473
Okay, you can do this,
big guy.

13:42.560 --> 13:44.736
Right.

13:44.824 --> 13:46.521
Thank you.
Thank you, Claire.

13:56.052 --> 13:59.012
- Oh, hey, Reginald.
- Oh, hey, hey.

13:59.099 --> 14:00.535
- Funny seeing you here.
- Oh, yeah.

14:00.622 --> 14:03.712
This is my, uh,
usual running route now.

14:03.799 --> 14:05.757
- Oh.
- I'm super big into running.

14:05.845 --> 14:07.411
So that's what I'm doing.

14:07.498 --> 14:10.458
Running, now.

14:10.545 --> 14:12.329
Probably would have been drier
at the library, right?

14:12.416 --> 14:13.896
Oh, yeah, sure.

14:13.983 --> 14:15.506
But can you think
of a better place

14:15.593 --> 14:18.205
to read "Wuthering Heights"?

14:18.292 --> 14:19.771
Yeah.

14:19.859 --> 14:22.818
Um, but, may I?
- Uh, yeah, sure.

14:30.957 --> 14:33.524
"If you ever look at me once
with what I know is in you,

14:33.611 --> 14:34.743
I'd be your slave."

14:34.830 --> 14:36.701
Is that in the book?

14:36.788 --> 14:38.094
Yeah.

14:38.181 --> 14:41.184
Um, what's your favorite part?

14:41.271 --> 14:42.794
I love
when Heathcliff returns,

14:42.882 --> 14:44.361
and he's not sad
and poor anymore,

14:44.448 --> 14:46.102
but he's, like, happy,
and rich, and successful...

14:46.189 --> 14:47.669
- Oh, whoa, stop.
- And ready for love.

14:47.756 --> 14:50.846
No, I just started
reading it--again.

14:50.933 --> 14:54.632
Or maybe for the first time?
I'm not entirely sure.

14:57.548 --> 15:00.856
Uh, well, anyway.

15:00.943 --> 15:02.640
I guess I'm gonna return

15:02.727 --> 15:07.471
to my intense exercise regimen.

15:07.558 --> 15:09.343
But maybe we could discuss
"Wuthering Heights"

15:09.430 --> 15:10.953
when you're done?

15:11.040 --> 15:13.651
I'd like that, yeah.
And don't overdo it.

15:13.738 --> 15:16.176
- Right.
- See you at work.

15:19.570 --> 15:23.487
"What's the Story,
Morning Glory?"

15:33.280 --> 15:34.977
Let's go.
Come on.

15:35.064 --> 15:38.546
Stick and move, Reggie.
Stick or move, man.

15:38.633 --> 15:40.896
Use your hips.

15:40.983 --> 15:43.159
Let's go.
Come on.

15:43.246 --> 15:45.161
Reggie, let's go.

15:45.248 --> 15:46.858
Look, the only way you're
gonna pass The Assessment

15:46.946 --> 15:49.035
is if you train for it, right?

15:49.122 --> 15:52.516
Okay, is this supposed
to make me stronger?

15:52.603 --> 15:53.996
Look, man,
we went over that.

15:54.083 --> 15:55.693
Your muscle-building days
are over.

15:55.780 --> 15:57.565
This is just
for warm-up purposes.

15:57.652 --> 16:02.352
So basically Exhibit A
in the court of my confusion.

16:02.439 --> 16:05.442
Also, I'm having
a hard time understanding

16:05.529 --> 16:06.878
why you signed me up
for a test

16:06.966 --> 16:08.968
that will almost certainly
end in my death.

16:09.055 --> 16:10.360
That feels like a bad plan.

16:10.447 --> 16:13.494
I came here to kill Angela.
All right?

16:13.581 --> 16:16.192
Angela decided
to kill me first.

16:16.279 --> 16:17.889
Guess who got caught
in between.

16:17.977 --> 16:20.066
That is not
addressing my concerns.

16:20.153 --> 16:21.676
The only way
to buy us some time

16:21.763 --> 16:23.025
was to commit to this,

16:23.112 --> 16:24.635
to keep Angela
out of our business.

16:24.722 --> 16:25.767
All right,
and don't just assume

16:25.854 --> 16:27.812
you can't succeed.

16:27.899 --> 16:29.379
We're gonna hone
your greatest gift.

16:29.466 --> 16:31.120
Right.

16:31.207 --> 16:32.774
Right, right, right.

16:32.861 --> 16:34.471
That I can glamour
other vampires,

16:34.558 --> 16:35.995
and that makes me amazing!

16:36.082 --> 16:37.474
No, that is not
a gift, Reggie.

16:37.561 --> 16:38.649
That's a secret.
Okay?

16:38.736 --> 16:39.955
And if you don't keep it
a secret,

16:40.042 --> 16:41.174
you won't even make it
to The Assessment

16:41.261 --> 16:44.525
because you'll end up dead.

16:44.612 --> 16:46.701
Look, I'm talking
about your big brain, man.

16:48.920 --> 16:51.793
One way or another,
we're gonna get through this.

16:54.187 --> 16:56.972
Preferably one where
I don't die, right?

16:57.059 --> 16:58.800
Yeah.
That's more or less the plan.

17:00.280 --> 17:02.934
Let's get you some water. Hydrate.

17:16.774 --> 17:18.515
Maurice!

17:18.602 --> 17:21.301
In this signed contract,
on page 15,

17:21.388 --> 17:24.173
it says I'm not the only one
who dies if I fail.

17:24.260 --> 17:26.480
My sire dies too.

17:26.567 --> 17:28.960
In case you forgot,
that's you.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.832
I didn't forget.

17:30.919 --> 17:33.052
Yeah.
You didn't mention it either.

17:33.139 --> 17:35.358
You got too much
on your plate as it is, man.

17:35.445 --> 17:37.317
Look, we're in this together.

17:37.404 --> 17:39.536
And...

17:39.623 --> 17:41.103
I believe in you.

17:41.190 --> 17:44.541
While I appreciate

17:44.628 --> 17:47.762
the possibly misplaced faith
you have in me,

17:47.849 --> 17:49.242
maybe the best plan

17:49.329 --> 17:51.722
is to get as far away
from here as possible.

17:51.809 --> 17:54.421
I mean,
I've never been to Italy.

17:54.508 --> 17:56.597
That'd be cool.
I just--

17:56.684 --> 17:58.164
You're already
on the council's radar.

17:58.251 --> 17:59.817
Okay, once that happens,

17:59.904 --> 18:01.471
there's no place far enough
you can hide,

18:01.558 --> 18:03.386
including Italy.

18:03.473 --> 18:07.086
So passing The Assessment's
our only hope.

18:07.173 --> 18:09.305
Something like that.

18:24.712 --> 18:26.496
- We should tell her.
- No.

18:26.583 --> 18:27.671
- You.
- Why?

18:27.758 --> 18:30.109
Oh, what is it?

18:31.762 --> 18:34.287
You could have ended Reginald
at any time.

18:34.374 --> 18:36.158
I would have been
more than happy to help.

18:36.245 --> 18:37.768
No.

18:37.855 --> 18:40.206
The Assessment's
the way to go.

18:40.293 --> 18:43.600
Kill him in the context
of a pre-ordained ritual.

18:43.687 --> 18:46.647
Of course.
You know best.

18:48.475 --> 18:50.346
But what if he succeeds?

18:50.433 --> 18:52.609
Training for The Assessment
takes years.

18:52.696 --> 18:54.698
You know that.

18:54.785 --> 18:57.614
There's no way he'll survive.

18:59.921 --> 19:03.664
And when Reginald dies,
Maurice dies with him.

19:03.751 --> 19:07.233
Exactly.
Win-win.

19:07.320 --> 19:09.322
Which means that
for the foreseeable future,

19:09.409 --> 19:12.412
I want you to keep an eye
on Reginald,

19:12.499 --> 19:13.978
every move he makes.

19:14.065 --> 19:17.373
But look and do not touch.

19:17.460 --> 19:19.462
I need him in one piece
for the big day.

19:19.549 --> 19:21.769
Well, that's no fun.

19:21.856 --> 19:25.076
Maybe just a small amount
of touching?

19:27.731 --> 19:31.039
What was it
that Moira said?

19:31.126 --> 19:34.042
"I fear no living man
or woman."

19:34.129 --> 19:35.304
Mm-hmm.

19:35.391 --> 19:38.481
Keep an eye on Reginald.

19:40.657 --> 19:43.007
Starting now.

19:43.094 --> 19:46.315
Go, depart!
Leave me.

20:00.068 --> 20:02.723
Oh, dude!

20:02.810 --> 20:05.291
Burnt marshmallow?

20:05.378 --> 20:06.901
This is my favorite.

20:06.988 --> 20:09.686
Mmm.
I get a treat, you get a treat.

20:09.773 --> 20:12.994
Fair is fair.
- I'm just happy to be here.

20:13.081 --> 20:15.562
Right, of course you are.

20:15.649 --> 20:17.694
Me too.

20:19.957 --> 20:21.307
Want some?

20:21.394 --> 20:23.787
Oh, you know me too well.

20:27.051 --> 20:28.879
both: Mmm.

20:28.966 --> 20:31.447
I can't believe
you used to be my bully,

20:31.534 --> 20:32.927
and now you're
my takeout menu.

20:33.014 --> 20:35.321
I was your bully?

20:35.408 --> 20:38.149
Mm-hmm.
Every day.

20:38.237 --> 20:41.022
- Why would I do that?
- Doesn't matter.

20:41.109 --> 20:42.502
Everything is different now.

20:51.206 --> 20:54.905
Oh, wow.

20:54.992 --> 20:57.299
Todd with an ice cream chaser.

21:04.219 --> 21:05.916
Yes.

21:06.003 --> 21:07.831
Mmm.

21:09.529 --> 21:11.313
Oh!

21:20.366 --> 21:22.281
This is
seriously messed up.

21:22.368 --> 21:24.021
What is?

21:24.108 --> 21:26.241
The Melon Heads,
the Loveland Frog,

21:26.328 --> 21:29.331
the Ohio Grassman--
Akron's had them all.

21:29.418 --> 21:31.507
It's like
Dante's tenth circle.

21:31.594 --> 21:33.901
Down the rabbit hole they go.

21:33.988 --> 21:36.817
Call me Alice.

21:36.904 --> 21:39.123
Look.

21:39.210 --> 21:41.256
This is a map
of known ley lines.

21:41.343 --> 21:43.345
Akron is a hotbed
for the unnatural.

21:43.432 --> 21:45.086
Maybe this X-File
is the key

21:45.173 --> 21:46.566
to your messed up head.

21:46.653 --> 21:48.524
Okay, supernatural frogs
are not responsible

21:48.611 --> 21:50.004
for my missing memories.

21:50.091 --> 21:55.009
But high energy zones
equal crazy,

21:55.096 --> 21:57.316
which means we have
to track where you were

21:57.403 --> 21:59.579
on the night you got foggy.

21:59.666 --> 22:01.537
Give me your phone.

22:04.105 --> 22:07.238
Hmm.
Ride share, perfect.

22:07.326 --> 22:10.677
Do you recognize
this address?

22:10.764 --> 22:13.680
I don't even remember
ordering this ride.

22:13.767 --> 22:16.639
You tipped,
therefore you arrived.

22:16.726 --> 22:18.772
Which means all we have
to do is look for--

22:22.123 --> 22:25.779
Does Todd seem weird to you?

22:25.866 --> 22:28.172
No more than usual.

22:28.259 --> 22:29.652
I think.

22:34.918 --> 22:37.965
Todd.

22:51.370 --> 22:54.895
Todd.
Sleator, Todd.

22:54.982 --> 22:57.767
Todd.
Todd Sleator.

22:59.943 --> 23:03.773
Oh, mercy, mercy me.

23:16.177 --> 23:17.613
Have you noticed
anything unusual

23:17.700 --> 23:19.833
about Reginald lately?

23:19.920 --> 23:21.748
Not really.

23:21.835 --> 23:24.533
Uh, he ran into me
at the park today.

23:24.620 --> 23:26.448
He was out jogging
in a hoodie.

23:26.535 --> 23:29.320
I guess that's unusual--
the jogging, I mean.

23:29.408 --> 23:31.801
- And?
- Nothing.

23:31.888 --> 23:33.194
We talked about
the book I was reading,

23:33.281 --> 23:35.022
and then he left.

23:35.109 --> 23:37.024
That's it?

23:37.111 --> 23:38.808
There was one weird thing.

23:38.895 --> 23:40.854
Go on.

23:40.941 --> 23:42.943
Reginald had just left
when out of nowhere,

23:43.030 --> 23:45.989
this song title
popped into my head.

23:46.076 --> 23:49.950
I don't think I've ever heard
the song before.

23:50.037 --> 23:52.692
Reginald.
He's behind this.

23:52.779 --> 23:55.651
No, Reginald would never do
anything to hurt me.

23:55.738 --> 23:59.699
I don't know why I know that,
but I do.

23:59.786 --> 24:01.527
With all my heart.

24:01.614 --> 24:02.876
Then why were you
at Reginald's address

24:02.963 --> 24:04.617
the night you lost your mind?

24:45.440 --> 24:47.660
Sarah.
What are you doing here?

24:47.747 --> 24:51.098
I mean, it's great to see you.
Come in.

24:56.886 --> 25:00.324
Have I been here before?

25:00.411 --> 25:05.242
I feel like maybe I...

25:07.331 --> 25:09.377
The thing is,

25:09.464 --> 25:13.599
I haven't really
been myself lately.

25:13.686 --> 25:19.430
And Ashley's pretty sure
I was here.

25:21.128 --> 25:22.869
You? Here?

25:22.956 --> 25:24.435
With me?

25:24.523 --> 25:26.873
But I don't remember.

25:26.960 --> 25:30.572
I mean, how could I forget
something like that?

25:30.659 --> 25:32.226
Because it's impossible,
that's why.

25:32.313 --> 25:33.793
I mean, I would remember
if you were here.

25:33.880 --> 25:35.403
And since you weren't,
that's actually something

25:35.490 --> 25:36.970
that's never happened, so--

25:37.057 --> 25:39.015
I mean, believe me.
I would not lie to you.

25:39.102 --> 25:41.452
I believe you.

25:41.540 --> 25:44.455
I just feel like
there's something

25:44.543 --> 25:47.197
missing inside my head,

25:47.284 --> 25:51.288
and I don't know
what it is.

25:59.209 --> 26:02.256
"What's the Story,
Morning Glory?"

26:02.343 --> 26:04.911
Oasis, nice.

26:04.998 --> 26:07.304
"Work Bitch."
Britney.

26:07.391 --> 26:10.220
"I'm So Bored
with the USA."

26:10.307 --> 26:11.613
The Clash.

26:11.700 --> 26:12.962
"We Gotta Get Out
of This Place."

26:13.049 --> 26:14.660
In my "Little Red Corvette"!

26:14.747 --> 26:16.009
You remembered.

26:16.096 --> 26:17.358
It's that game
we play at work.

26:17.445 --> 26:18.664
Yes!

26:18.751 --> 26:21.318
But it's more.

26:21.405 --> 26:24.974
I think that--I th...

26:28.064 --> 26:30.850
Wow, um...

26:33.679 --> 26:35.637
Um...

26:38.031 --> 26:39.641
Are you busy tomorrow night?

26:39.728 --> 26:41.164
Tomorrow?

26:41.251 --> 26:42.992
No, I'm not busy.

26:43.079 --> 26:44.951
I think it would be fun
if we went out.

26:45.038 --> 26:48.563
Maybe to dinner and a movie.

26:48.650 --> 26:50.434
I'd like that.

26:50.521 --> 26:52.219
Great.

26:52.306 --> 26:54.482
Tomorrow.

26:54.569 --> 26:56.440
You and me.

26:56.527 --> 26:58.399
Yeah.

27:08.235 --> 27:10.367
- I like this place.
- Mm.

27:10.454 --> 27:11.934
Wait till you try
the pancit and lumpia.

27:12.021 --> 27:14.110
Almost as good as my mom makes.

27:16.025 --> 27:17.679
I like you.

27:17.766 --> 27:20.073
I like you too.

27:20.160 --> 27:23.859
But I forgot that I did,
among other things.

27:23.946 --> 27:26.949
Then I remembered.
How is that even possible?

27:27.036 --> 27:29.473
I guess we'll never know.

27:29.560 --> 27:31.171
I will say,

27:31.258 --> 27:34.043
I think lumpia might be
the best place to start.

27:34.130 --> 27:36.393
But I think I do know.

27:36.480 --> 27:39.048
And you might be
the only person

27:39.135 --> 27:41.137
who understands.

27:43.313 --> 27:45.315
It's PTSD.

27:45.402 --> 27:46.708
Oh, that's a relief.

27:46.795 --> 27:48.754
Hm?

27:48.841 --> 27:50.407
Oh, my goodness.

27:50.494 --> 27:53.497
How did that even happen?

27:53.584 --> 27:56.849
My family are very religious.

27:56.936 --> 28:00.853
I was raised
to worship archangels.

28:00.940 --> 28:04.247
I think I've heard of that.
That's like a cult, right?

28:04.334 --> 28:06.293
Not exactly,

28:06.380 --> 28:08.687
but my whole life,

28:08.774 --> 28:11.820
every decision
was made for me,

28:11.907 --> 28:16.390
and my brother too--
every moment controlled.

28:16.477 --> 28:19.262
Well,
how did you get out of that?

28:21.308 --> 28:23.353
One year ago last week,

28:23.440 --> 28:25.573
I stuffed everything
I could into a backpack

28:25.660 --> 28:27.749
and ran away.

28:27.836 --> 28:31.361
It's like I ran away
from the angels,

28:31.448 --> 28:33.842
and then they, like,
followed me here.

28:33.929 --> 28:36.410
- But not actually, right?
- No.

28:36.497 --> 28:39.239
Oh.

28:39.326 --> 28:42.285
But sometimes,
it feels like they did.

28:44.592 --> 28:47.290
Well, I think you're the
bravest person I've ever met.

28:52.469 --> 28:53.993
Tell me about you.

28:54.080 --> 28:55.385
Sure.

28:55.472 --> 28:57.779
I...

29:01.827 --> 29:03.698
Urgently have to urinate.

29:03.785 --> 29:06.962
Oh, okay.

29:17.320 --> 29:20.410
What are you two vapids
doing here?

29:20.497 --> 29:23.283
Would you mind introducing us
to your young friend?

29:23.370 --> 29:26.373
Yes.
She looks delicious.

29:26.460 --> 29:28.723
And we're starving.
- You stay away from her.

29:28.810 --> 29:30.725
Is that a threat?

29:30.812 --> 29:33.075
How in the world
could you possibly stop us?

29:33.162 --> 29:37.514
Dinner first,
your little friend for dessert.

29:37.601 --> 29:39.081
Listen to me.

29:52.747 --> 29:54.967
Hello, Ash.
Better get out there.

29:55.054 --> 29:56.969
It's a packed house.

29:57.056 --> 29:59.101
You're very peppy today, Todd.

29:59.188 --> 30:02.322
I love the scarf.

30:02.409 --> 30:03.932
Hmm.
Well, it's an ascot.

30:04.019 --> 30:05.629
- May I?
- No, no.

30:05.716 --> 30:07.718
I must never take it off.

30:09.590 --> 30:12.854
Holy Faith Lehane.

30:12.941 --> 30:15.161
What happened there?
- What do you mean?

30:15.248 --> 30:16.510
You have two holes
in your neck.

30:16.597 --> 30:19.382
I do?

30:19.469 --> 30:21.776
How are you not aware
of the neck-hole situation?

30:21.863 --> 30:24.910
I don't know.

30:24.997 --> 30:27.129
They're here.

30:27.216 --> 30:29.479
They're right here in Akron.

30:29.566 --> 30:31.568
True, it wasn't my first guess,
but they're actually here,

30:31.655 --> 30:35.050
and this is the proof I needed.

30:35.137 --> 30:37.531
Hello, Ash.
Better get out there.

30:37.618 --> 30:39.620
It's a packed house.

30:42.928 --> 30:44.886
Vampires.

30:47.236 --> 30:49.064
I'm gonna take
an order of these to go,

30:49.151 --> 30:51.458
'cause how have I not been
eating them my whole life?

30:51.545 --> 30:53.503
Mmm.

30:53.590 --> 30:55.897
Mmm.
It's so good.

30:55.984 --> 30:58.073
Mm-hmm.

30:58.160 --> 31:00.902
I told you my story.
Tell me yours.

31:00.989 --> 31:02.425
- Okay.
- First date rule.

31:02.512 --> 31:04.819
I want to hear
all about your family.

31:06.603 --> 31:09.998
Well, we first moved out here
when I was a kid.

31:10.085 --> 31:12.479
Mom, Dad, me.
Only kid, right?

31:12.566 --> 31:15.351
- Mm-hmm.
- Then they moved to Hawaii.

31:15.438 --> 31:17.223
So now it's just me.

31:17.310 --> 31:19.181
Hmm.
You miss them.

31:19.268 --> 31:21.488
Yeah, every day.

31:21.575 --> 31:24.404
I've been meaning to go out
to visit them, but now...

31:24.491 --> 31:26.493
Now?

31:26.580 --> 31:27.929
Everything's changed.

31:28.016 --> 31:29.757
What's changed?

31:29.844 --> 31:32.847
Life things.

31:32.934 --> 31:35.719
That's not very specific.

31:35.806 --> 31:38.722
It's, uh--

31:38.809 --> 31:41.638
you know, round trip airfare's
prohibitively expensive...

31:41.725 --> 31:43.118
That's true.

31:43.205 --> 31:45.294
And the weather
in Hawaii is, you know,

31:45.381 --> 31:47.427
Windy, and cloudy,

31:47.514 --> 31:49.124
and rainy, and then sunny.

31:49.211 --> 31:50.865
You know?
It's, like, make up your mind.

31:50.952 --> 31:53.085
Hawaii, come on.

31:53.172 --> 31:56.175
Well, I hope that you get
to see them soon.

31:56.262 --> 31:58.786
Someday.

32:13.496 --> 32:14.933
Whoa.

32:15.020 --> 32:16.499
Cleanup on aisle
table over there.

32:16.586 --> 32:18.153
Hmm?

32:18.240 --> 32:20.721
Oh.

32:20.808 --> 32:23.332
Wow.

32:23.419 --> 32:26.335
Okay.

32:26.422 --> 32:29.121
Oh, okay.

32:29.208 --> 32:30.557
Wow.

32:30.644 --> 32:32.211
Bold.

32:34.865 --> 32:36.867
Really escalating.

32:36.955 --> 32:38.782
Oh.

32:38.869 --> 32:40.871
Oh, my--

32:42.786 --> 32:45.659
Oh, my--

32:47.878 --> 32:50.229
I've never seen food
enjoyed so much before.

32:50.316 --> 32:52.971
No.
Like, sure?

32:53.058 --> 32:54.624
I guess?

32:54.711 --> 32:56.583
That's--oh.

32:56.670 --> 32:58.977
Oh.

32:59.064 --> 33:01.370
Ha!

33:07.420 --> 33:09.291
Stop.

33:15.080 --> 33:17.996
Do you want to try
and get some dessert still?

33:18.083 --> 33:21.695
I don't think I can ever
look at food again.

33:21.782 --> 33:24.393
Check please.

33:36.797 --> 33:39.713
Yes, well, naturally
we couldn't be happier

33:39.800 --> 33:41.106
than to be hosting

33:41.193 --> 33:43.369
the first Assessment
of the year.

33:43.456 --> 33:47.068
All that's left now
is to send out the invitations.

33:47.155 --> 33:48.765
I'm sorry,
Vice Chair Renuka,

33:48.852 --> 33:50.985
could you please repeat that?

33:53.857 --> 33:57.252
No, no, I'm just--just stunned.

33:57.339 --> 33:59.646
But thrilled to hear that

33:59.733 --> 34:03.258
Logan the Desanguinator
will be attending.

34:04.825 --> 34:07.045
I'll begin the preparations.

34:07.132 --> 34:09.047
Talk soon.

34:11.701 --> 34:13.094
Angela,
I need to talk to you.

34:13.181 --> 34:14.661
Go away.

34:14.748 --> 34:16.576
I'm done spying on Maurice.

34:16.663 --> 34:18.317
I want out.

34:23.670 --> 34:25.541
No.
- I'm serious.

34:25.628 --> 34:27.021
So am I.

34:27.108 --> 34:30.938
Don't you dare forget
what I did for you

34:31.025 --> 34:33.419
or why you made the deal
that you did.

34:33.506 --> 34:35.073
The information
I'm about to give you

34:35.160 --> 34:37.379
is worth anything I ask for,

34:37.466 --> 34:40.034
including my own freedom.

34:40.121 --> 34:41.949
I'll be the judge of that.

34:42.036 --> 34:44.299
It's about Maurice's progeny,
the fat vampire.

34:44.386 --> 34:47.650
Oh, God, not again.

34:47.737 --> 34:51.872
When will I be rid
of that meddlesome abomination?

34:51.959 --> 34:55.484
Reginald Andres
has a unique gift.

34:55.571 --> 34:58.574
There's nothing unique
about him.

34:58.661 --> 35:00.663
Yes, there is.

35:05.146 --> 35:08.193
Reginald can glamour
other vampires.

35:08.280 --> 35:10.804
That's impossible,
and you know it.

35:10.891 --> 35:14.938
Earlier tonight,
you two had a very special

35:15.025 --> 35:17.289
and carefully
orchestrated dinner

35:17.376 --> 35:19.204
that left you covered
in each other's vomit.

35:19.291 --> 35:20.814
That's disgusting.

35:20.901 --> 35:23.033
We did no such thing.

35:23.121 --> 35:25.471
True, they charged us extra
for cleanup.

35:25.558 --> 35:27.995
And whose mess
required cleaning?

35:28.082 --> 35:30.432
I don't recall.

35:30.519 --> 35:33.043
--- off,
the both of you.

35:35.916 --> 35:40.964
So he glamoured
LeBron and Penelope.

35:41.051 --> 35:44.098
Made them do things
they did not want to do.

35:44.185 --> 35:46.970
Which is how
he helped Maurice escape.

35:47.057 --> 35:49.016
He glamoured Erich.

35:49.103 --> 35:52.715
And what's to stop him
from glamouring you?

35:52.802 --> 35:55.544
He'll never get the chance.

35:55.631 --> 35:58.460
But think of all
the damage he can do

35:58.547 --> 36:00.636
between now
and The Assessment.

36:00.723 --> 36:04.118
He'll never make it that far.

36:04.205 --> 36:09.079
Reginald will die
long before The Assessment.

36:09.167 --> 36:10.864
I'll make sure of it.

36:13.519 --> 36:16.304
Which means Maurice will live.

36:16.391 --> 36:18.654
As I had hoped.

36:18.741 --> 36:21.048
And where does that leave us?

36:24.094 --> 36:26.053
You've earned your freedom.

36:29.970 --> 36:32.146
I can feel you two lurking.

36:37.673 --> 36:41.155
I need a burner phone
that can't be traced.

36:41.242 --> 36:44.289
Oh, are you unhappy
with your current service?

36:44.376 --> 36:47.553
No, you moron.

36:47.640 --> 36:49.642
I need to contact Nikki.

36:51.557 --> 36:53.820
Are you quite sure
this is necessary?

36:53.907 --> 36:55.256
Nikki brings
death and destruction

36:55.343 --> 36:56.562
wherever she travels.

36:56.649 --> 37:00.087
Do as you are told.

37:26.809 --> 37:28.942
I'm sorry about last night.

37:29.029 --> 37:31.336
I wanted it to be perfect,
and it turned into a mess.

37:31.423 --> 37:34.252
And that was my fault.

37:34.339 --> 37:36.645
I'll understand
if you don't ever

37:36.732 --> 37:38.473
want to go out with me again.

37:38.560 --> 37:40.040
This may come
as a surprise to you,

37:40.127 --> 37:42.347
but there are two people
in this relationship.

37:42.434 --> 37:44.958
Just because you thought
last night wasn't perfect,

37:45.045 --> 37:46.786
doesn't mean
I didn't think it was.

37:46.873 --> 37:48.744
The food was great.

37:48.831 --> 37:52.357
And then--okay, it got gross,
but it wasn't boring.

37:52.444 --> 37:54.924
And the gross part
certainly wasn't your fault.

37:55.011 --> 37:57.318
Did you say relationship?

37:59.189 --> 38:01.148
Um...

38:08.068 --> 38:09.330
Hello, young lovers.

38:09.417 --> 38:12.768
Burn in hell, Nosferatu.

38:12.855 --> 38:15.336
- Oh...
- Ashley!

38:15.423 --> 38:19.079
Whoa.
- Oh.

38:19.166 --> 38:21.299
What the hell, Ashley?

38:27.566 --> 38:29.219
Something very strange
is going down

38:29.307 --> 38:30.656
at the Slushy Shack.

38:30.743 --> 38:32.005
You mean my friend
shooting me with water

38:32.092 --> 38:33.180
for no apparent reason?

38:33.267 --> 38:34.747
That fits.
- It's not just water.

38:34.834 --> 38:36.531
It's holy water.

38:36.618 --> 38:38.968
Oh, my God,
this is holy water?

38:39.055 --> 38:41.101
Three weeks ago, they found
this dude in his Porsche

38:41.188 --> 38:43.712
in a bar parking lot,
deader than dead.

38:43.799 --> 38:45.105
Barely a drop of blood
left in him,

38:45.192 --> 38:46.933
two holes in his neck.

38:47.020 --> 38:51.067
Just like Todd.

38:51.154 --> 38:54.462
Down the rabbit hole
they go again.

38:54.549 --> 38:56.856
Like, Todd?
Holes, where?

38:56.943 --> 38:58.771
That can't be it.
That's not right.

38:58.858 --> 39:00.860
Why do you think
he's wearing that scarf?

39:00.947 --> 39:04.429
Maybe to, you know,
expand his fashion palette?

39:04.516 --> 39:06.126
That is not fashion.

39:06.213 --> 39:08.258
Somebody's feeding on Todd.
Do you know what that means?

39:08.346 --> 39:10.348
Vampires.

39:12.741 --> 39:14.177
Vampires are just a story.

39:14.264 --> 39:15.918
That's what I thought.

39:16.005 --> 39:18.007
But then we got
that dead dude in his car.

39:18.094 --> 39:19.705
And then Sarah's
missing memories.

39:19.792 --> 39:21.576
I'm starting
to get them back.

39:21.663 --> 39:22.882
Great news,
but that doesn't mean

39:22.969 --> 39:24.449
somebody didn't take them.

39:24.536 --> 39:26.059
Vampires can do that.

39:26.146 --> 39:29.149
Why would someone want
to take my memories?

39:29.236 --> 39:30.672
Depends on what they took.

39:30.759 --> 39:33.632
Little things
like rent checks,

39:33.719 --> 39:37.853
the book I was reading,
and Reginald.

39:37.940 --> 39:39.333
Why would someone
want me to forget

39:39.420 --> 39:41.509
how I feel about him?

39:41.596 --> 39:43.816
That's part of what I forgot.

39:43.903 --> 39:45.383
Totally glad to hear.

39:45.470 --> 39:47.254
Fair question,
and I don't have an answer yet,

39:47.341 --> 39:49.909
but by process of elimination,

39:49.996 --> 39:52.128
Todd's neck holes,
missing spaces in Sarah's head,

39:52.215 --> 39:55.001
I figured...

39:55.088 --> 39:57.220
Me?

39:57.307 --> 39:59.919
I'm the vampire?
Ashley, come on.

40:00.006 --> 40:01.486
I did till you passed
the holy water test.

40:01.573 --> 40:03.226
That is an airtight
detection method.

40:03.313 --> 40:04.750
That's Vatican approved.

40:04.837 --> 40:07.274
Hey, Earth to Ashley.

40:07.361 --> 40:08.710
Everyone's gonna
pass that test

40:08.797 --> 40:11.452
because vampires are not real.

40:11.539 --> 40:13.933
Hey, the only thing
you're gonna accomplish

40:14.020 --> 40:16.457
is getting people wet.

40:16.544 --> 40:18.503
Something evil
has this way come

40:18.590 --> 40:21.157
to Rubber City.

40:21.244 --> 40:23.682
I'm going to find out
what it is.

40:29.818 --> 40:31.864
Are you sleepy?

40:31.951 --> 40:34.693
A little.
Are you?

40:34.780 --> 40:36.477
I mean, we have been
doing this for three hours.

40:38.131 --> 40:40.002
I've never talked
that long before.

40:40.089 --> 40:41.961
Me neither.

40:42.048 --> 40:44.964
Maybe just one more hour?

40:45.051 --> 40:47.575
At least one more.

40:50.143 --> 40:52.537
Whoa!
Holy--

40:52.624 --> 40:53.712
<i>Are you okay?</i>

40:53.799 --> 40:55.714
Uh, I saw a raccoon.

40:55.801 --> 40:58.325
- In your apartment?
- Oh, I mean yesterday.

40:58.412 --> 41:01.328
It still haunts me.

41:01.415 --> 41:02.547
Can I call you
tomorrow morning?

41:02.634 --> 41:03.852
You better.

41:03.939 --> 41:06.028
Okay.

41:07.813 --> 41:10.337
Sarah likes me again.

41:10.424 --> 41:12.252
We went on a date.

41:12.339 --> 41:13.775
'Cause you glamoured her,
didn't you?

41:13.862 --> 41:15.951
I would never do that to her.

41:16.038 --> 41:17.692
I felt a surge last night,

41:17.779 --> 41:19.912
the kind
that accompanies a glamour--

41:19.999 --> 41:21.043
a big one.

41:21.130 --> 41:23.350
I would never glamour Sarah,

41:23.437 --> 41:26.179
even if it was to undo
what you did to her.

41:26.266 --> 41:29.138
But LeBron and Penelope
did threaten her,

41:29.225 --> 41:31.227
so I glamoured them.

41:31.314 --> 41:32.968
And I had a little fun
at the restaurant.

41:33.055 --> 41:34.753
And that's all.
- That's all?

41:34.840 --> 41:36.450
Reggie, I told you
not to do this,

41:36.537 --> 41:37.886
and that means not doing it

41:37.973 --> 41:40.106
without fully understanding
the consequences.

41:40.193 --> 41:42.064
And definitely
not outside in public.

41:42.151 --> 41:44.414
I screwed up once, okay?
I'm sorry.

41:44.502 --> 41:46.982
Reggie, I warned you.

41:47.069 --> 41:50.029
You fail to keep this secret,
and you die.

41:50.116 --> 41:51.552
Then I die.

41:51.639 --> 41:53.598
Oh, and Sarah?

41:53.685 --> 41:55.251
She dies too.

41:55.338 --> 41:56.905
Yeah.

41:56.992 --> 41:58.690
Yeah, she's the problem,
isn't she?

41:58.777 --> 42:01.344
She makes you lose control,
and she makes you reckless.

42:01.431 --> 42:03.129
Sarah's the best thing
that's ever happened to me.

42:03.216 --> 42:06.175
Well, that's over with now.
You understand me?

42:06.262 --> 42:08.656
You can't make me
not see her.

42:08.743 --> 42:10.353
Reggie, I can do
whatever needs to be done.

42:10.440 --> 42:11.703
Really?

42:11.790 --> 42:13.139
Because I think
between the two of us,

42:13.226 --> 42:16.359
I think I'm the only one
who can actually do that.

42:20.276 --> 42:23.802
Trust me, Reggie.

42:23.889 --> 42:27.196
If there's one thing I know,
it's this.

42:27.283 --> 42:30.504
No matter how much
you love a human,

42:30.591 --> 42:34.116
eventually, you will hurt them.

42:36.554 --> 42:40.601
And you'll never
forgive yourself.

42:40.688 --> 42:42.124
Never.
