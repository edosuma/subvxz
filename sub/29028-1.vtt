01:03.772 --> 01:05.524
Oh, hey, wait, wait, wait.
I'll help.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.234
Okay. Thank you.

01:07.275 --> 01:08.485
Yeah.

01:09.695 --> 01:13.198
Okay. Oh.

01:13.240 --> 01:15.385
Remember when we had a stock
team to help with carry-outs?

01:15.409 --> 01:17.285
Ah. Yeah, it's not so bad.

01:17.327 --> 01:19.955
You know, he got rid
of someone else last night.

01:19.997 --> 01:21.373
- Who?
- Peter.

01:21.415 --> 01:22.541
- Seriously?
- Yeah.

01:22.583 --> 01:25.044
He was so friendly.

01:27.128 --> 01:29.423
Sure he was nice,
but Bob couldn't afford him.

01:29.464 --> 01:31.383
Now I'm desperately trying
to find ways

01:31.425 --> 01:33.260
to make myself indispensable.

01:33.301 --> 01:34.779
You know what I spent all night
doing last night?

01:34.803 --> 01:37.472
- Hm?
- Brushing up on art deco styles.

01:37.514 --> 01:39.558
Oh, well, just like
the old days.

01:39.600 --> 01:41.643
Cramming
for art history midterms.

01:41.685 --> 01:44.103
Oh. What's happening to me?

01:44.145 --> 01:45.874
I feel like I'm moving
in the wrong direction.

01:45.898 --> 01:47.357
No, it's just temporary.

01:47.399 --> 01:48.835
Yeah, but what happens
when we get laid off

01:48.859 --> 01:50.778
from our throwaway jobs
that we had to take

01:50.819 --> 01:52.088
because we got laid off
from our real jobs?

01:52.112 --> 01:54.114
We're not gonna get laid off.

01:56.951 --> 01:59.202
Oh, uh, there he is.
There's Bob.

01:59.244 --> 02:00.788
- Oh, hey, Bob.
- Hey.

02:00.829 --> 02:04.750
Hi, uh... Linda, Carrie.

02:04.792 --> 02:05.894
How have
your afternoon sales been?

02:05.918 --> 02:07.669
- Can't complain.
- Well...

02:07.711 --> 02:10.464
Uh, listen. Inventory.
I wanna get one more count in...

02:10.505 --> 02:12.049
Uh-uh, hold on, Bob,
let me stop you.

02:12.091 --> 02:14.885
We, we're gonna go on a trip
out of town,

02:14.927 --> 02:16.303
um, all weekend, so...

02:16.344 --> 02:19.932
Well, I actually
was talking about today.

02:19.974 --> 02:21.976
Uh, we close
in four hours, though.

02:22.017 --> 02:25.145
Times are tight. Just handle it.

02:25.186 --> 02:26.521
How are...

02:41.078 --> 02:43.288
Linda.

02:43.330 --> 02:46.792
Eric. You can't just
show up here.

02:46.834 --> 02:48.919
I left you six voicemails.

02:48.961 --> 02:50.420
Uh, you think that's normal?

02:50.462 --> 02:54.215
I don't care about normal.
I care about money.

02:54.257 --> 02:55.986
Did you think I wouldn't notice
that you raised the price

02:56.010 --> 02:57.970
of the house?
It's way over market now.

02:58.012 --> 02:59.238
I'm trying to get a good return.

02:59.262 --> 03:00.531
If it takes a little longer,
then...

03:00.555 --> 03:01.598
Well, I'm through waiting.

03:01.640 --> 03:02.975
Drop the price of the house.

03:03.017 --> 03:05.144
Okay? I'm not gonna
ask you again.

03:05.184 --> 03:07.771
Yeah, I'm sure you will.

03:07.813 --> 03:09.397
You drop the price.

03:09.439 --> 03:13.777
Welcome to Bayside Antiques,
Mr. Marshall.

03:13.819 --> 03:15.863
Carrie, get out of my face.
I'm not here to shop.

03:15.904 --> 03:18.657
In that case, I'm gonna have
to ask you to leave.

03:18.699 --> 03:21.660
You see, we have a strict
no loitering policy.

03:21.702 --> 03:25.164
Um, I can get a manager to come
and talk to you about it.

03:25.204 --> 03:26.581
Drop the price.

03:33.714 --> 03:36.091
The worst part is, he's right.

03:36.133 --> 03:38.677
I am kind of blocking
the sale of the house.

03:38.719 --> 03:41.138
Well, it's a beautiful home,

03:41.180 --> 03:44.307
but it's a beautiful home
that you're clinging on to

03:44.349 --> 03:45.785
because it's the one thing
in your life

03:45.809 --> 03:47.519
you have control over right now.

03:47.561 --> 03:50.981
Ow! Thank you, Doctor.

03:51.023 --> 03:52.375
Do you really wanna live
in the house

03:52.399 --> 03:54.943
that you and your ex-husband
bought together?

03:54.985 --> 03:57.571
No.

03:59.156 --> 04:01.575
But it's all I have right now.

04:01.616 --> 04:02.951
Well, here's a wild idea.

04:02.993 --> 04:06.163
You sell the house,
take half of the money,

04:06.205 --> 04:09.290
move to the West Coast like
you've always wanted to do

04:09.332 --> 04:11.793
and make it big.

04:11.835 --> 04:13.754
And then you can get me a job.

04:16.005 --> 04:20.301
- Uh... yeah. I don't know.
- What?

04:20.343 --> 04:21.863
I mean, you really think
it's gonna be easier

04:21.887 --> 04:23.847
to secure interviews out there
than it is here?

04:23.889 --> 04:25.432
Probably not.

04:26.558 --> 04:30.062
But I know
what you're capable of.

04:30.104 --> 04:33.356
You designed the entire interior
of the Hildebrand Building.

04:33.398 --> 04:36.068
I did not.
That is an oversimplification.

04:36.110 --> 04:40.030
Sure, they, they took your
design, added gaudy balustrades,

04:40.072 --> 04:43.158
and called it something new,
but we both know

04:43.200 --> 04:45.326
that that was your work.

04:45.368 --> 04:48.622
And those sketches
on your resume...

04:48.663 --> 04:50.165
Heads will turn.

04:50.207 --> 04:53.794
Yeah. Well, why am I
not turning heads now?

04:53.835 --> 04:55.420
You turned one head.

05:00.175 --> 05:03.220
- I'm sorry?
- I don't mean to eavesdrop.

05:03.262 --> 05:05.722
I just wanted to say
that you turned one head.

05:05.764 --> 05:08.349
Ah. Really?

05:08.391 --> 05:10.852
Yes, I was at the Hildebrand
last week for a business meeting

05:10.894 --> 05:14.148
and, uh, it's not the most
attractive block in the city,

05:14.189 --> 05:17.484
but the interior design of that
place is, it's breathtaking.

05:17.525 --> 05:19.486
And your friend is right.

05:19.527 --> 05:22.489
Those balustrades
are way too flashy.

05:22.530 --> 05:24.658
Looks like you have a fan.

05:24.699 --> 05:27.535
Hi. I'm Tony.

05:27.577 --> 05:28.745
Carrie.

05:30.038 --> 05:32.082
And this is Linda.

05:32.124 --> 05:34.542
It's a pleasure to meet you,
Linda.

05:34.584 --> 05:37.171
So are you, like,
a design reviewer or...

05:37.212 --> 05:39.923
Reviewer? No, nothing like that.

05:39.965 --> 05:43.302
I'm just a fan of all things
that are pretty.

05:44.928 --> 05:47.514
So are you, uh, both designers?

05:47.555 --> 05:51.852
Um, well,
Linda specializes in interiors

05:51.893 --> 05:55.396
and I am a landscape architect.

05:55.438 --> 05:58.275
Right now we're both
technically, um...

05:59.318 --> 06:01.569
in between firms.

06:01.611 --> 06:02.946
- Stop.
- Anyway, what do you do?

06:02.988 --> 06:05.324
Nothing as, uh, interesting

06:05.364 --> 06:07.366
as what you two do.

06:07.408 --> 06:09.203
I'm a private investigator.

06:09.244 --> 06:12.122
Well, where is your fedora
and trench coat?

06:12.164 --> 06:15.625
I left those in the '40s. Hm.

06:17.836 --> 06:20.005
Uh, I think
I'm gonna call it a night.

06:20.047 --> 06:22.174
No, no, no, no. This was fun.

06:22.216 --> 06:24.134
I hope you won't
ever need my services,

06:24.176 --> 06:26.761
but here's my card,
just in case.

06:31.058 --> 06:32.976
You really are
a private investigator.

06:33.018 --> 06:34.978
I am.

06:35.020 --> 06:37.314
Goodnight, Mr., um, Sarno?

06:37.356 --> 06:39.066
- Good night.
- Good night.

07:25.737 --> 07:27.030
Hey.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.576
Hey.

07:34.246 --> 07:35.830
Are you following me?

07:35.872 --> 07:37.999
Get away from me, lady.

07:38.041 --> 07:39.709
You were at the bar.

07:39.751 --> 07:41.753
So?

07:41.795 --> 07:44.631
So you were staring at me
at the bar and now here.

07:44.672 --> 07:46.442
I don't have any idea
what you're talking about.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.219
Stay away from me
or I'm calling the police.

07:49.261 --> 07:52.764
You're full of it, lady.
Get over yourself.

10:09.609 --> 10:13.613
Okay, and you're sure
that this is the same guy

10:13.654 --> 10:16.991
that you saw in the bar
and the store?

10:17.033 --> 10:19.286
- I'm sure.
- And, uh...

10:19.327 --> 10:20.745
He-he wasn't driving anything?

10:20.787 --> 10:23.081
You couldn't get
a license plate number?

10:23.123 --> 10:24.874
- No.
- Okay.

10:24.916 --> 10:26.126
Well, we'll broadcast

10:26.167 --> 10:27.835
- his description.
- Okay.

10:27.877 --> 10:29.170
And we're gonna keep an eye out

10:29.212 --> 10:30.838
on the neighborhood tonight.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.675
Great. Thank you.

10:34.717 --> 10:36.052
Okay.

10:46.771 --> 10:48.689
Bet you're wishing
you'd spent more time with me

10:48.731 --> 10:50.691
and the private-eye candy
at the bar.

10:50.733 --> 10:54.404
- Come on.
- Too soon?

10:54.446 --> 10:56.090
Well, maybe this is a sign
that you really should

10:56.114 --> 10:58.450
sell your place
and get out of here.

10:58.492 --> 11:00.494
No, I mean, if I'm gonna leave,

11:00.535 --> 11:03.288
I want it to be
because I decided to,

11:03.330 --> 11:06.082
not because of Eric
or some peeping Tom.

11:15.842 --> 11:19.929
I know your type.
You want men to look at you.

11:21.764 --> 11:26.936
When we do,
you scream and yell about it.

11:26.978 --> 11:28.480
Your name is Linda Marshall.

11:29.897 --> 11:32.025
And your friend's name
is Carrie Fields.

11:33.401 --> 11:35.362
I know where she lives, too.

11:35.403 --> 11:36.655
Linda.

11:42.410 --> 11:44.538
We're circulating
the man's description

11:44.579 --> 11:47.624
and we'll increase
the police presence

11:47.666 --> 11:49.376
around your neighborhood
and here.

11:49.417 --> 11:52.253
That's all you're gonna do?

11:52.295 --> 11:54.755
I called you because I need
someone to track this guy down.

11:54.797 --> 11:58.218
I assure you,
we're doing everything we can.

11:58.259 --> 12:00.761
Is this going to take
much longer, Detective?

12:00.803 --> 12:02.556
Bob, this is serious.

12:07.561 --> 12:09.246
Have you... Have you talked
to the bartender

12:09.270 --> 12:11.231
or the cashier
at the Quick Mart?

12:11.272 --> 12:12.833
Spoke with both of them,
neither have anything

12:12.857 --> 12:15.068
of real value to contribute.

12:15.109 --> 12:18.071
But we have the security footage

12:18.112 --> 12:20.823
and this we'll review
for ID'ing the suspects.

12:20.865 --> 12:22.617
So you haven't reviewed it yet?

12:22.659 --> 12:24.536
These things take time,
Ms. Marshall.

12:24.578 --> 12:26.663
If you can be patient...

12:26.705 --> 12:28.599
It's hard to be patient,
Detective, when I'm expecting

12:28.623 --> 12:31.959
this guy to pop up around
any corner. I don't feel safe.

12:32.001 --> 12:34.379
Look, I can appreciate
your position,

12:34.421 --> 12:37.591
but, um, we're moving
as quickly as we can.

12:37.632 --> 12:40.843
We do not have unlimited
resources and this is,

12:40.885 --> 12:43.137
this is not the only case
we're working on.

12:44.681 --> 12:46.391
What if I hire
a private investigator?

12:46.433 --> 12:50.395
Well, they're expensive
and frankly don't do much good.

12:50.437 --> 12:53.940
In fact, I find
that they do more to interfere

12:53.981 --> 12:56.775
with our investigation
than they actually do to help.

12:56.817 --> 12:58.087
Well, Detective,
it doesn't seem like

12:58.111 --> 13:00.447
there's much to interfere with.

13:00.488 --> 13:02.657
You're gonna want
to trust me on this.

13:24.763 --> 13:25.972
Come in.

13:32.145 --> 13:33.438
Hi.

13:34.355 --> 13:35.649
Nice office.

13:35.690 --> 13:38.025
Thanks.
A friend of mine owns the bar.

13:38.067 --> 13:39.818
Lets me use it
during the day time.

13:39.860 --> 13:41.195
Please, have a seat.

13:42.947 --> 13:46.493
I've got to be honest. I didn't
think I'd be hearing from you.

13:46.534 --> 13:49.621
You seemed a bit put off
the other night.

13:49.663 --> 13:50.747
Uh, yeah.

13:51.914 --> 13:55.293
Sorry, it was a,
it was a long day.

13:55.335 --> 13:56.835
As was today, it seems.

13:57.754 --> 13:59.255
Yeah.

13:59.297 --> 14:00.632
So over the phone you said

14:00.674 --> 14:02.759
you've got a guy
that's a stalker,

14:02.801 --> 14:05.136
at home, work and the bar.

14:05.178 --> 14:06.971
And you've filed
a police report?

14:07.013 --> 14:08.889
I did.

14:08.931 --> 14:12.477
And to be honest,
the police warned me

14:12.519 --> 14:14.437
about involving
someone like you.

14:15.605 --> 14:17.982
But it just seems like...

14:18.024 --> 14:19.900
Not much they can do.

14:19.942 --> 14:21.152
Yeah.

14:22.737 --> 14:27.158
So my question is,
is there anything you can do?

14:27.200 --> 14:28.993
This is my job.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.662
For a fee, of course.

14:30.704 --> 14:33.373
Right.
Um, how much do you charge?

14:33.414 --> 14:36.501
One twenty five an hour,
plus mileage and expenses.

14:36.543 --> 14:38.586
There's a $2000 deposit.

14:38.628 --> 14:40.338
And I'm not exactly
making a fortune

14:40.380 --> 14:43.383
at Bayside Antiques right now,
so I'm...

14:43.424 --> 14:46.927
Look, I really hate stalkers.

14:46.969 --> 14:49.114
And you don't deserve to have
your life terrorized by him.

14:49.138 --> 14:51.766
So I'll waive the deposit.

14:51.808 --> 14:53.059
Okay.

14:54.561 --> 14:56.396
No offense, but, um...

14:57.938 --> 14:59.816
if it takes you weeks
to catch this guy,

14:59.858 --> 15:01.317
then that doesn't really matter.

15:01.359 --> 15:04.028
I've been doing this
a long time, Ms. Marshall.

15:04.070 --> 15:06.239
I work quick. Trust me.

15:08.074 --> 15:10.117
And how about we say, um,

15:10.159 --> 15:13.913
we'll bump my fee
down to 80 an hour?

15:13.954 --> 15:15.599
Well, I don't want you doing me
any favors.

15:15.623 --> 15:17.876
No strings attached. I promise.

15:17.917 --> 15:22.255
Let's call it a I'm-sorry-I-hit-
on-you-at-the-bar discount.

15:23.631 --> 15:24.883
Okay.

15:24.924 --> 15:26.467
Great.
I'll draw up the paperwork.

15:26.509 --> 15:29.679
Great.
Well, thank you, Mr. Sarno.

15:29.721 --> 15:31.013
Uh, Tony.

15:32.557 --> 15:33.767
Thank you.

15:33.808 --> 15:35.351
- Have a lovely day.
- Yes. You, too.

15:35.393 --> 15:37.019
- I'll be in touch.
- Thank you.

15:55.079 --> 15:56.849
You know, it's funny
how the world works, huh?

15:56.873 --> 15:58.768
<i>Okay, so one minute
you're shooting him down,</i>

15:58.792 --> 15:59.976
<i>and the next you're hiring him?</i>

16:00.000 --> 16:02.086
He's doing a job. That's it.

16:02.128 --> 16:04.505
<i>I knew deep down you had
a soft spot for mysterious men.</i>

16:04.547 --> 16:05.840
I'll call you later.

16:05.882 --> 16:07.508
<i>Okay. Be careful.</i>

16:07.550 --> 16:08.718
Okay.

17:44.856 --> 17:46.691
"Carl Ruston," huh?

17:48.442 --> 17:50.570
You're not so tough,
are you now, Carl?

17:53.322 --> 17:55.258
What were you planning
on doing with that crowbar, huh?

17:55.282 --> 17:56.492
You're gonna break in?

17:58.077 --> 17:59.078
Good boy.

18:29.817 --> 18:31.277
What, what are you doing here?

18:31.318 --> 18:33.571
Oh, I just took a little tumble
in the sand...

18:34.488 --> 18:36.866
with your stalker.

18:36.908 --> 18:38.409
Does the name Carl Ruston mean

18:38.451 --> 18:40.286
- anything to you?
- No.

18:40.327 --> 18:42.538
I guess
it doesn't really matter.

18:42.580 --> 18:45.041
But I'm pretty sure
you won't be seeing him again.

18:46.125 --> 18:47.543
Your knuckles are bleeding.

18:47.585 --> 18:49.169
Oh, well, it's nothing.

18:49.211 --> 18:50.964
Just a bit
of occupational hazard.

18:51.005 --> 18:52.590
And so is, is your head.

18:52.632 --> 18:56.844
Seriously, it's nothing.
It's... Oh...

18:56.886 --> 19:00.347
Ah. Hey, why don't you come in?
Let me take a look at that.

19:00.389 --> 19:02.600
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, please.

19:10.149 --> 19:11.567
Here. Come, sit down.

19:13.069 --> 19:14.278
I'll bring you a dry t-shirt.

19:27.834 --> 19:31.587
Uh, hey, this was my husband's.
I think it'll fit.

19:31.629 --> 19:34.674
Um, seriously,
you, you don't have to.

19:34.715 --> 19:36.050
No, please, take it.

19:42.056 --> 19:45.018
Look, this Ruston guy,

19:45.059 --> 19:46.769
he knows
that we have his ID now,

19:46.811 --> 19:49.647
so he's no longer anonymous.

19:49.689 --> 19:52.232
I doubt he'll risk showing
his face around here again.

19:52.274 --> 19:53.567
I-I didn't even know him.

19:53.609 --> 19:56.696
I mean, why would he pick me
as a target?

19:56.737 --> 20:00.700
Look, uh, sometimes
creeps don't need a reason.

20:00.741 --> 20:02.952
So should I take all this
to the police?

20:04.328 --> 20:07.665
That may not be the best idea.

20:07.707 --> 20:09.917
Why? Shouldn't they know
who he is?

20:11.127 --> 20:13.963
Uh...
It could complicate things.

20:16.423 --> 20:18.258
Look, what happened tonight,

20:18.300 --> 20:21.428
in my line of work,
that's normal.

20:21.470 --> 20:24.765
If cops found out
I roughed him up a bit,

20:24.807 --> 20:26.934
that could make some headaches
for me.

20:31.313 --> 20:33.399
Okay. I won't say a word.

20:34.775 --> 20:35.943
Thank you.

20:38.571 --> 20:41.866
Well, I have to hand it to you,
you do work fast.

20:41.908 --> 20:45.036
Yeah. Uh, thanks again
for the shirt.

20:45.078 --> 20:46.079
Yeah, no problem.

20:46.120 --> 20:48.122
- Oh...
- Oh, you okay?

20:48.164 --> 20:50.124
Yeah.

20:50.166 --> 20:51.751
Just a little lightheaded there.

20:51.792 --> 20:53.145
Uh, should we take you
to a hospital?

20:53.169 --> 20:55.796
No, no, I'm fine, uh...

20:55.838 --> 20:58.257
I'm... Seriously, I'm, I'm okay.

20:58.298 --> 21:00.927
Well, um,
I can make you a cup of coffee.

21:00.968 --> 21:03.429
You know,
that, uh, that sounds nice.

21:04.430 --> 21:05.556
Okay.

21:12.772 --> 21:14.012
I mean, I wasn't gonna say that.

21:19.195 --> 21:22.281
- Um...
- Are you expecting someone?

21:22.322 --> 21:23.866
No.

21:23.908 --> 21:26.035
Um, I'll-I'll be right back.

21:38.839 --> 21:40.133
This isn't a good time, Eric.

21:40.174 --> 21:42.635
It's never a good time, Linda.

21:42.676 --> 21:44.637
I'm through
playing nice with you.

21:44.678 --> 21:46.346
You're clearly doing
everything you can

21:46.388 --> 21:47.765
to block the sale of this house.

21:47.807 --> 21:49.767
Look, I can buy
your half of the house

21:49.809 --> 21:51.685
and pay you a portion
every month!

21:51.727 --> 21:54.563
No, I need my money now and
I'm gonna do whatever it takes,

21:54.605 --> 21:56.274
even if it means
kicking you out.

21:56.315 --> 21:58.151
If you're gonna be that way,

21:58.192 --> 22:00.194
I'm filing a motion
to nullify the agreement.

22:00.236 --> 22:02.071
On what grounds?

22:02.113 --> 22:03.489
You can't.

22:03.530 --> 22:05.449
Maybe not.

22:05.491 --> 22:08.744
But if I try to,
all that paperwork takes time.

22:08.786 --> 22:10.704
It takes a really long time.

22:12.248 --> 22:14.541
You think I'm gonna let you
get the best of me?

22:16.585 --> 22:18.838
- Ah!
- Whoa.

22:18.879 --> 22:21.715
- It's not nice to grab.
- Who the hell are you?

22:21.757 --> 22:23.843
That's none of your business.

22:23.884 --> 22:25.219
Is that my shirt?

22:25.261 --> 22:27.471
Is this what
you've been busy doing?

22:27.513 --> 22:29.723
Huh? Are you living here?

22:29.765 --> 22:31.934
This is why you don't wanna
sell the house?

22:33.186 --> 22:35.188
Now I see what's going on.

22:35.229 --> 22:36.897
You're sleeping with my wife
in my bed...

22:36.939 --> 22:40.776
Ex-wife, if I've got
my facts straight.

22:40.818 --> 22:44.780
I'm pretty sure she can spend
time with whomever she pleases.

22:44.822 --> 22:46.422
You got it wrong, buddy.
Not in my house.

22:46.448 --> 22:48.909
As long as I own this place,
I say who lives here.

22:48.951 --> 22:50.328
So get out.

22:53.331 --> 22:54.957
You're gonna make me?

22:55.916 --> 22:58.627
Eric, stop. Just don't.

23:04.675 --> 23:06.219
- Are you all r...
- Don't touch me!

23:09.347 --> 23:11.849
You're gonna stand there,
let your boyfriend assault me?

23:11.891 --> 23:14.060
I'm-I'm sorry,
I didn't know he was gonna...

23:14.101 --> 23:16.478
You might wanna get that
looked at.

23:16.520 --> 23:19.315
I heard it pop.
It could be broken.

23:21.359 --> 23:22.735
This isn't over.

23:27.198 --> 23:29.242
- He's a nice guy.
- Yeah.

23:29.283 --> 23:30.927
You-you didn't have to hit him
in the face.

23:30.951 --> 23:33.287
I'm not making things
easier for you, am I?

23:33.329 --> 23:36.623
No.

23:36.665 --> 23:38.143
Look, I-I appreciate you
trying to help,

23:38.167 --> 23:41.419
but, um, I'm gonna get to sleep.

23:41.461 --> 23:43.381
Yeah. Of course.

23:45.174 --> 23:46.259
You'll send me a bill?

23:46.300 --> 23:47.927
I'll, uh, send you a bill

23:47.968 --> 23:50.137
first thing in the morning.

23:50.179 --> 23:52.430
You think I could grab my shirt?

23:52.472 --> 23:53.849
Maybe I can get it resewn.

23:53.891 --> 23:55.517
Yeah, I'll, I'll get it for you.

24:06.653 --> 24:07.696
Linda, thank you.

24:07.738 --> 24:09.156
You're welcome. Just...

24:10.074 --> 24:12.952
Again... I'm sorry.

24:20.500 --> 24:22.336
I don't see what the problem is.

24:22.378 --> 24:25.839
To me, it sounds like
you took care of two things.

24:25.881 --> 24:28.092
You should've seen it, though.

24:28.134 --> 24:32.305
He had this, like, intensity
in his eyes that...

24:32.346 --> 24:34.556
And the way he hit Eric...

24:34.598 --> 24:37.393
Okay,
so he's a little dangerous.

24:37.435 --> 24:39.395
You could use a little danger
in your life,

24:39.437 --> 24:41.397
especially if it comes
with a six pack.

24:41.439 --> 24:43.774
- Carrie...
- Okay, fine.

24:43.816 --> 24:47.569
At least you know he's around
if you pick up another stalker.

24:47.611 --> 24:50.656
He's not around. He did a job,
and that's the end of it.

24:50.697 --> 24:53.075
I mean, I doubt
I'll ever even see him again.

24:53.117 --> 24:56.996
Um, I wouldn't be
too sure about that.

24:57.037 --> 25:00.540
Hi. Good afternoon.
How can we help you?

25:00.582 --> 25:05.045
Yes, I was hoping I could pick
up a few things for my place.

25:05.087 --> 25:09.758
Um, maybe a lamp to brighten
things up a little bit.

25:09.800 --> 25:12.636
Well, you are in luck

25:12.678 --> 25:17.099
because Linda here
is our lamp expert.

25:17.141 --> 25:19.810
I'm sure you'll get a lot
of great suggestions from her.

25:19.852 --> 25:21.770
So, um, I'll be back.

25:21.812 --> 25:24.106
- Okay, thanks.
- Thank you.

25:26.566 --> 25:28.235
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:30.279 --> 25:33.407
Um, how did you know
where I worked?

25:33.449 --> 25:35.742
Well, I followed you.

25:35.784 --> 25:40.039
- What?
- You told me... at my office.

25:40.080 --> 25:43.709
You didn't really come here
for a lamp, did you?

25:43.750 --> 25:47.171
Uh, no, I didn't. I...

25:47.213 --> 25:49.048
Actually, I came to apologize.

25:50.341 --> 25:51.425
For what?

25:51.467 --> 25:52.885
Thinking about it, it seems like

25:52.926 --> 25:54.237
this situation you're having
with your house

25:54.261 --> 25:56.305
is a bit precarious.

25:56.347 --> 25:59.725
And what happened last night
seems like

25:59.766 --> 26:02.228
I may have made your life
a little bit more difficult.

26:02.269 --> 26:05.064
Well, he had it coming.

26:05.105 --> 26:08.359
Still, um,
I feel like I owe you.

26:08.401 --> 26:10.819
Any chance you'll let me
take you to dinner?

26:12.530 --> 26:13.780
Are you normally in the habit

26:13.822 --> 26:16.116
of asking your clients
out for dinner?

26:16.158 --> 26:18.035
Most of my clients
are middle-aged lawyers.

26:18.077 --> 26:19.870
- They're not really my type.
- Oh.

26:19.912 --> 26:22.415
Technically,
you're a former client.

26:22.456 --> 26:24.208
I sent you a bill this morning.

26:24.250 --> 26:25.918
So what do you say?

26:28.670 --> 26:30.065
Are you gonna tell me
more stories about

26:30.089 --> 26:31.257
how much you love my designs

26:31.298 --> 26:32.925
that you've never seen?

26:32.966 --> 26:35.719
I think I learned my lesson
on that one.

26:35.761 --> 26:38.138
Then dinner sounds great.

26:38.180 --> 26:40.724
Perfect. So I'll call you.

26:40.766 --> 26:43.185
- Sure.
- Right.

26:45.438 --> 26:47.481
Have a good day, Linda.

26:47.523 --> 26:48.648
You, too.

27:37.406 --> 27:38.491
Hello?

27:38.532 --> 27:40.909
Hey. It's Tony.

27:40.951 --> 27:43.078
Oh. Well, you don't waste
any time, do you?

27:43.120 --> 27:45.205
Uh, life's too short to wait.

27:45.247 --> 27:46.457
I like that.

27:46.499 --> 27:48.375
I made us reservations tonight.

27:49.627 --> 27:52.045
Well, you're very sure
of yourself.

27:52.087 --> 27:54.256
How do you know I'm available?

27:54.298 --> 27:56.133
Are you?

27:56.175 --> 27:58.135
Depends.
Where are you taking me?

27:58.177 --> 28:01.930
It's, um,
a very exclusive place.

28:01.972 --> 28:03.098
I'm sure you'll like it.

28:03.140 --> 28:04.308
So I should dress formal?

28:04.350 --> 28:06.143
No, no. Strictly casual.

28:06.185 --> 28:07.394
Mysterious.

28:07.436 --> 28:10.397
Pick you up at 7:00?

28:10.439 --> 28:12.107
I'll be ready.

28:12.149 --> 28:13.900
Perfect. I'll see you then.

28:51.855 --> 28:53.273
Wow.

28:53.315 --> 28:54.650
Thank you.

28:54.692 --> 28:56.818
- You're ready to go?
- Yes.

28:56.860 --> 28:58.529
Come on. Table's waiting.

29:04.951 --> 29:07.162
Well, um, where are we going?

29:07.204 --> 29:10.040
You'll see. I know a shortcut.

29:10.082 --> 29:11.351
Well, last I checked,
there are no restaurants

29:11.375 --> 29:14.211
around here, so... It's new.

29:14.253 --> 29:16.129
Ah, okay.

29:16.171 --> 29:18.882
Good, we made it
before it got too busy.

29:28.559 --> 29:30.519
I hope this place
is as good as I hear.

29:30.561 --> 29:32.104
Me, too.

29:32.145 --> 29:34.398
- I can't believe the scenery.
- I know.

29:35.608 --> 29:36.900
It's not bad.

29:36.942 --> 29:39.152
- Let me help you.
- Sure. Heh.

29:40.820 --> 29:42.448
Mm. Thank you.

29:45.492 --> 29:48.161
- Can I pour you some wine?
- Please.

29:51.665 --> 29:54.543
So... antiquities.

29:54.585 --> 29:57.212
Heh. Yeah. Yeah.

29:57.254 --> 30:00.924
- How'd you get into that?
- Well...

30:00.966 --> 30:03.260
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

30:03.302 --> 30:06.430
It's temporary,
it's like a part-time thing,

30:06.472 --> 30:09.266
sort of a transition-style job.

30:09.308 --> 30:12.936
I used to work at a big
designing firm with Carrie,

30:12.978 --> 30:14.938
uh, which was great.

30:14.980 --> 30:18.024
But the higher-ups
started to take credit

30:18.066 --> 30:20.569
for all of the work
the junior designers were doing,

30:20.611 --> 30:23.739
so Carrie and I said something.

30:23.781 --> 30:28.452
And then they decided
they had to downsize.

30:28.494 --> 30:30.663
So we were let go.

30:32.623 --> 30:34.625
I can hear
where your passion is.

30:36.126 --> 30:38.044
Sounds like you really love it.

30:38.086 --> 30:39.672
Yeah, I do. I really do.

30:41.340 --> 30:44.050
I mean, ever since I was a kid,
I used to pore over

30:44.092 --> 30:46.428
interior-design books, you know,

30:46.470 --> 30:49.723
while my friends were obsessing
over the latest teen novel.

30:50.808 --> 30:52.768
It's just not my style.

30:52.810 --> 30:55.270
And then I met Carrie in college
and we made such a great team

30:55.312 --> 30:58.023
that we kind of
stuck together, so...

30:58.064 --> 31:02.277
But lately, things have been
a little rough.

31:02.319 --> 31:04.488
Be patient,
it's only a matter of time

31:04.530 --> 31:07.449
before someone recognizes
your talent.

31:07.491 --> 31:09.284
I mean, I did.

31:09.326 --> 31:12.371
Oh, God!

31:14.748 --> 31:16.500
What about you?

31:16.542 --> 31:19.169
Do you love what you do?

31:19.211 --> 31:22.589
Investigating cheaters and
chasing the occasional stalker?

31:22.631 --> 31:24.591
It's hard to love
something like that.

31:24.633 --> 31:28.679
But it's a living.
I'm good at it.

31:30.347 --> 31:32.182
I'm putting my training to use,
so...

31:32.224 --> 31:34.309
What did you do in the army?

31:34.351 --> 31:38.564
I can't really talk about it.
It's... It's classified.

31:38.605 --> 31:39.815
Oh.

31:40.982 --> 31:42.693
- Really?
- No.

31:42.735 --> 31:44.820
Ah, stop doing that.

31:46.655 --> 31:49.115
I was a combat medic.

31:49.157 --> 31:53.203
I knew about all the carnage
that was going on over there.

31:53.245 --> 31:56.998
Thought maybe I can go out,
give a helping hand.

31:57.040 --> 31:59.167
So you're good
at healing people, then?

31:59.209 --> 32:01.754
Yeah, something like that.

32:01.795 --> 32:03.296
Just, um...

32:05.799 --> 32:09.344
not so good at keeping yourself
out of harm's way.

32:14.391 --> 32:16.231
Sometimes there's people
worth putting yourself

32:16.268 --> 32:17.936
in harm's way for.

32:38.331 --> 32:40.500
Tony, wait, I...

32:44.588 --> 32:45.714
What?

32:47.173 --> 32:50.302
It's just been
a little while for me, so...

32:50.343 --> 32:51.929
I'll be gentle.

33:30.968 --> 33:33.553
So I woke up this morning
and I found this and the glass.

33:34.805 --> 33:37.140
You noticed anything missing?

33:37.182 --> 33:39.017
No, this is not a robbery.

33:39.058 --> 33:41.186
Somebody's trying
to s-send me a message.

33:41.227 --> 33:44.690
- You have some enemies lately?
- Enemies? No.

33:44.731 --> 33:49.194
I mean... No, I don't...
Who is it?

33:50.779 --> 33:53.365
Uh... Uh, my ex-wife.

33:53.406 --> 33:57.369
Her new boyfriend. He doesn't
seem to care for me too much.

33:57.410 --> 33:58.495
Uh...

34:00.330 --> 34:02.123
- He gave you that?
- Yeah.

34:04.209 --> 34:07.004
Um, anyway, do you think
he could've done this?

34:07.045 --> 34:10.130
- What's his name?
- I don't know.

34:10.172 --> 34:13.217
Um, her name's Linda Marshall.

34:13.259 --> 34:15.387
I guess I can give you
her address if you need it.

34:18.389 --> 34:20.976
Why not? I'll look into it.

34:21.018 --> 34:22.643
Thank you.

34:30.527 --> 34:34.406
Ooh, somebody's
chipper this morning.

34:34.447 --> 34:37.784
- Mm...
- Okay, so the date went well?

34:39.159 --> 34:40.996
Uh, it was fine.

34:41.038 --> 34:43.040
Okay, wait, wait, wait.
I... I need details.

34:43.081 --> 34:46.710
Carrie, I need your
help here. Right now, please.

34:46.752 --> 34:48.962
- Okay, okay.
- It's all right.

34:49.004 --> 34:50.505
I... I'll be back.

34:50.547 --> 34:52.841
Organize your thoughts
in the meantime.

34:52.882 --> 34:56.762
I want a thorough and expansive,
complete narrative retelling

34:56.803 --> 34:59.347
of everything that happened,
okay? I'm coming back.

34:59.389 --> 35:01.433
- Okay, okay, okay.
- Okay?

35:08.147 --> 35:09.858
Ms. Marshall.

35:09.900 --> 35:11.276
Have you a moment?

35:11.317 --> 35:13.570
Yes, Detective. Sure.

35:13.612 --> 35:14.988
I won't take long.

35:16.489 --> 35:18.199
How are you?

35:18.241 --> 35:19.743
Fine.

35:19.785 --> 35:21.369
Have you heard anymore
from the man

35:21.411 --> 35:22.579
that was bothering you?

35:22.621 --> 35:24.414
No, not since the other day.

35:24.456 --> 35:25.832
Good.

35:25.874 --> 35:28.752
Perhaps he got the hint
to leave you alone.

35:28.794 --> 35:30.670
Yeah. I hope so.

35:32.089 --> 35:33.357
So I went by your place
this morning.

35:33.381 --> 35:34.400
Naturally, you were not there.

35:34.424 --> 35:35.926
I knew I'd find you here.

35:35.968 --> 35:37.176
But upon leaving, I observed

35:37.218 --> 35:40.138
a for-sale sign out front.

35:40.179 --> 35:42.432
Is that because of the stalker?

35:42.474 --> 35:44.183
No.

35:44.225 --> 35:45.894
It's a, um...

35:47.395 --> 35:48.855
It's a divorce thing.

35:48.897 --> 35:50.107
Oh.

35:51.900 --> 35:53.795
Thank you so much for
checking up on me, Detective.

35:53.819 --> 35:55.129
But I have a lot to do
this morning.

35:55.153 --> 35:56.255
- So...
- Yes, of course. Of course.

35:56.279 --> 35:59.198
Just, just, just...
one more thing.

35:59.240 --> 36:01.200
I got a phone call this morning.

36:01.242 --> 36:04.579
It seems there was an incident
involving your ex-husband.

36:05.580 --> 36:06.706
What kind of incident?

36:06.748 --> 36:09.084
- So you haven't heard?
- No.

36:09.126 --> 36:10.418
Vandalism.

36:11.419 --> 36:13.212
At his house.

36:13.254 --> 36:16.382
Yeah, someone smashed up
a few windows.

36:16.424 --> 36:18.510
Oh, that's terrible. I...

36:19.928 --> 36:22.472
I'm not sure
what this has to do with me.

36:23.431 --> 36:24.933
Well, he is of the impression

36:24.975 --> 36:26.977
that you know the culprit.

36:27.894 --> 36:30.105
Mentioned a boyfriend.

36:31.898 --> 36:34.233
My God.

36:34.275 --> 36:37.487
No. Uh, Eric is wrong.

36:37.529 --> 36:38.697
About which part?

36:40.657 --> 36:43.493
He was also sporting
a broken nose.

36:43.535 --> 36:46.121
Said it was a separate issue,
but just curious.

36:46.163 --> 36:49.875
Would you happen to know
where or how he got that?

36:53.545 --> 36:56.089
Ms. Marshall?

36:56.131 --> 36:58.508
Withholding information
in a police investigation

36:58.550 --> 37:00.301
is a very serious offense.

37:02.971 --> 37:05.682
Look, Eric stormed into my house
the other night

37:05.724 --> 37:09.686
looking for a fight,
and my... friend

37:09.728 --> 37:12.189
was protecting me.
It was self defense.

37:12.230 --> 37:14.440
He had absolutely nothing to do
with any vandalism.

37:15.734 --> 37:17.443
Do you know
where he was last night?

37:17.485 --> 37:19.154
Yes. He was with me.

37:20.072 --> 37:21.614
All night?

37:21.656 --> 37:24.283
- That's right.
- All right.

37:24.325 --> 37:26.870
Well, we're gonna need
to speak with him, regardless.

37:26.912 --> 37:28.705
So do you mind giving me
his name?

37:31.083 --> 37:34.002
Tony... Sarno.

37:36.546 --> 37:38.297
So you ignored my advice.

37:38.339 --> 37:39.758
I needed that creep
out of my life

37:39.799 --> 37:41.551
and Tony got the job done.

37:41.593 --> 37:42.928
And to what extent, may I ask,

37:42.969 --> 37:45.931
did he help you
with this problem?

37:45.972 --> 37:49.809
He didn't give me the details
and I didn't bother to ask.

37:49.851 --> 37:52.896
All I know
is that he made it happen.

37:54.439 --> 37:57.358
Look, my personal opinion

37:57.400 --> 37:59.360
about private investigators
aside,

37:59.402 --> 38:01.279
I strongly recommend

38:01.320 --> 38:03.656
that you do not get involved
with Mr. Sarno.

38:03.698 --> 38:05.742
Professionally or otherwise.

38:05.784 --> 38:08.661
Why? What do you know about him?

38:08.703 --> 38:12.540
I know he's messy.
I know he's dangerous.

38:13.792 --> 38:15.269
You're just trying to scare me,
Detective.

38:15.293 --> 38:17.254
I'm trying to warn you.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.714
Tony Sarno is bad news.

38:25.553 --> 38:27.305
Well, thank you for the advice.

38:27.346 --> 38:28.974
I do really need
to get back to work.

38:29.015 --> 38:30.267
Of course.

38:32.894 --> 38:34.729
Well, thank you for your time.

38:34.771 --> 38:36.731
Thank you, Detective.
Have a good day.

39:05.510 --> 39:07.386
Good morning.

39:07.428 --> 39:09.181
<i>You sleep well?</i>

39:09.222 --> 39:10.807
Yeah.

39:10.849 --> 39:13.601
Um, hey, I, I just got a visit
from the police.

39:13.643 --> 39:15.436
What for?

39:15.478 --> 39:18.148
Well, apparently,
someone vandalized Eric's house.

39:18.190 --> 39:19.858
That's terrible.

39:19.899 --> 39:22.610
Couldn't have happened
to a nicer guy.

39:22.652 --> 39:25.905
Yeah, you didn't have anything
to do with that, did you?

39:25.947 --> 39:29.284
- No. Of course not.
- Yeah, I didn't think so.

39:29.326 --> 39:32.037
<i>What would make you think
that I did?</i>

39:32.078 --> 39:33.705
Well, I didn't, but, um,

39:33.746 --> 39:36.124
Detective Groves seems to think
that you did.

39:36.166 --> 39:37.792
I mean, he's...

39:37.834 --> 39:40.670
He said that he's had
some prior dealings with you.

39:44.716 --> 39:46.509
- Tony?
<i>- Yeah.</i>

39:46.551 --> 39:47.635
I'm here.

39:48.970 --> 39:50.805
Groves. Yeah, I know him.

39:52.515 --> 39:55.101
Well, he doesn't seem to have
the highest opinion of you.

39:55.143 --> 39:56.936
<i>Well, the cops look down
on my line of work,</i>

39:56.978 --> 40:00.106
<i>and he's one of 'em.</i>

40:00.148 --> 40:02.126
Yeah, well, I know that you
don't really like police

40:02.150 --> 40:04.694
getting involved in your work,
so I just wanted to let you know

40:04.736 --> 40:06.445
that I had to give him
your name.

40:06.487 --> 40:10.200
<i>Hey, it's okay.
You did the right thing.</i>

40:10.242 --> 40:13.328
I'm just here at the office
finishing up some work, so...

40:13.370 --> 40:16.039
<i>I guess I'll see him
when he gets here.</i>

40:16.081 --> 40:17.832
Look, don't worry about a thing.

40:17.874 --> 40:19.376
All right.

40:19.417 --> 40:22.045
Thanks. I'll-I'll-I'll call you
later tonight.

40:22.087 --> 40:24.714
<i>Sounds good.
I'll talk to you soon.</i>

40:24.756 --> 40:25.965
Bye.

40:46.903 --> 40:49.364
Looks like it's locked.

40:49.406 --> 40:51.783
It's a good thing
I have the keys.

40:51.824 --> 40:52.992
Mr. Sarno...

40:54.493 --> 40:55.703
Come on in.

41:02.377 --> 41:05.964
So I'm sure you know
why I'm here.

41:06.005 --> 41:08.341
- Ms. Marshall filled me in.
- Hm.

41:08.383 --> 41:10.009
Seems like
there's some sort of trouble

41:10.051 --> 41:12.345
with her... ex-husband.

41:12.387 --> 41:14.639
What's your relationship
with Ms. Marshall?

41:15.848 --> 41:17.350
It started out professional.

41:17.392 --> 41:19.602
It's become
a little more personal.

41:19.644 --> 41:22.647
But how is this relevant
to your investigation?

41:22.688 --> 41:25.108
We at the police department
like to examine

41:25.150 --> 41:27.026
a little thing called motive.

41:27.068 --> 41:29.112
Perhaps you've heard of it.

41:29.154 --> 41:30.822
Well, let me help you out.

41:30.863 --> 41:33.992
I did not vandalize
Mr. Marshall's home.

41:34.033 --> 41:36.202
Yeah, she told me that.

41:36.244 --> 41:39.372
She also told me
about a little argument

41:39.414 --> 41:41.707
you guys had.

41:41.749 --> 41:46.338
And you don't look
quite as banged up as he does.

41:46.379 --> 41:48.340
Luckily for me, he's got
a really slow right hook.

41:48.381 --> 41:50.633
Yeah, luckily for you,
he's not pressing charges.

41:51.717 --> 41:53.928
Self-defense.

41:53.970 --> 41:56.389
Always have an answer
for everything, don't you?

41:56.431 --> 41:57.556
Try to.

41:59.434 --> 42:02.061
Look, a guy like that,

42:02.103 --> 42:05.064
I'm sure he's bound to have
collected a lot of enemies.

42:05.106 --> 42:06.732
And if you look at all,

42:06.774 --> 42:09.235
I'm sure you'd find
a handful of 'em.

42:09.277 --> 42:11.154
But if you get stuck,

42:11.196 --> 42:12.947
I'm always here willing to help.

42:12.989 --> 42:14.615
For a fee, of course.

42:17.702 --> 42:19.620
You know, how about we...

42:21.080 --> 42:23.124
How about we stop
with the games, son?

42:24.542 --> 42:26.503
See, I know it was you, Sarno.

42:28.254 --> 42:31.216
I'm not bothered
by a few broken windows,

42:31.257 --> 42:35.136
but I'm getting a very
distinct sense of <i> deja vu</i> here.

42:35.178 --> 42:37.347
Now, you continue on this path,

42:37.389 --> 42:41.184
and I'll have you behind bars
faster than you can blink.

42:41.226 --> 42:43.269
And there'll be
no technicalities...

42:44.437 --> 42:47.106
to get in my way this time.

42:49.942 --> 42:53.321
I appreciate the heads-up,
Detective.

42:53.363 --> 42:56.615
But if you're not here
to charge me with something,

42:56.657 --> 42:58.076
there's the door.

43:04.916 --> 43:07.335
Oh, one more thing.

43:07.377 --> 43:10.338
What happened
to Ms. Marshall's stalker?

43:11.256 --> 43:13.174
Hm.

43:13.216 --> 43:16.094
He must have seen all the boys
in blue prowling around.

43:16.135 --> 43:17.554
You scared him off.

43:18.555 --> 43:20.139
Nice work, Detective.

43:32.860 --> 43:33.819
Look, whatever this is...

43:33.861 --> 43:35.363
Where's your boyfriend?

43:35.405 --> 43:37.049
Tony had nothing to do
with your house.

43:37.073 --> 43:38.366
The hell he didn't.

43:38.408 --> 43:39.409
If you keep harassing me,

43:39.451 --> 43:40.535
I'm filing a restraining...

43:40.577 --> 43:42.620
Harassing you? Look at my face.

43:42.661 --> 43:44.723
Do you know how embarrassing
it is to go into work like this?

43:44.747 --> 43:46.124
You brought that on yourself.

43:46.165 --> 43:48.418
Okay, be reasonable
for a second.

43:49.461 --> 43:51.296
You're costing me my career.

43:51.337 --> 43:53.965
I lost two major clients
yesterday.

43:54.006 --> 43:55.841
Tell me
you're gonna sell the house.

43:59.095 --> 44:00.430
Fine. I'm done with you.

44:00.472 --> 44:02.056
What? What does that mean?

44:02.098 --> 44:03.516
That means I'm gonna sue you.

44:03.558 --> 44:04.659
And when my attorneys are done,

44:04.683 --> 44:05.786
you're gonna have nothing...

44:05.810 --> 44:07.645
No money, no house, no nothing.

44:07.686 --> 44:10.148
- You can't do that, Eric.
- Watch me!

44:10.189 --> 44:12.066
- Hey!
- Hey, hey, hey.

44:12.108 --> 44:13.610
Stop him. Stop him.

44:13.651 --> 44:15.111
Excuse me.

44:17.113 --> 44:18.448
Linda, didn't you see

44:18.490 --> 44:20.325
- what just happened?
- No, I don't...

44:20.366 --> 44:22.261
That guy just ran off
with one of the antique watches.

44:22.285 --> 44:23.661
I'm so sorry.

44:23.702 --> 44:25.997
And why was your husband
here again?

44:26.038 --> 44:27.624
- Another personal issue?
- No.

44:27.665 --> 44:29.083
I'm... I'm so sorry, Bob.

44:29.125 --> 44:31.085
- It'll never happen again.
- Go home, Linda.

44:31.127 --> 44:32.962
At this point,
you're just costing me money.

44:33.004 --> 44:34.713
Bob, are you firing me?

44:34.755 --> 44:36.674
You can clean out your things.

44:36.715 --> 44:38.176
Bob, I...

44:43.931 --> 44:45.266
Oh, my God.

44:50.229 --> 44:52.731
Hey. Let me help you with that.

44:52.773 --> 44:54.484
Uh, what are you doing here?

44:54.526 --> 44:55.901
Knew you were having a busy day.

44:55.943 --> 44:58.029
I thought
I'd come and surprise you.

44:58.070 --> 45:01.115
Well, I appreciate that, but,
um, it's not really a good time.

45:01.157 --> 45:04.327
Are you sure?
I came all this way.

45:04.369 --> 45:06.912
I appreciate that,
I just, um, I need to be alone.

45:06.954 --> 45:10.124
I need some time to think.

45:10.166 --> 45:12.751
Is there anything I can do
to help?

45:12.793 --> 45:15.463
No, I... I just,
I need to do this on my own.

45:16.922 --> 45:18.132
Thank you, though.

45:53.084 --> 45:55.169
Tony?

45:55.211 --> 45:58.005
What are you...
Why are you here?

46:01.133 --> 46:02.885
Ow!

46:02.927 --> 46:05.137
Ow! Stop!

46:05.179 --> 46:06.889
Does this make you angry?

46:06.931 --> 46:09.267
- What?
- Are you angry?

46:09.308 --> 46:12.144
Yes! Please get off me.
Please. Please, please.

46:12.186 --> 46:13.354
Fight.

46:13.396 --> 46:15.732
- Get off me.
- Fight back!

46:15.772 --> 46:19.235
Get off me now! Please stop.

46:19.277 --> 46:22.739
Do you not fight back
because you're too weak?

46:22.779 --> 46:25.157
Get off me!

46:25.199 --> 46:27.826
- Make me.
- What? Tony, please get off me.

46:27.868 --> 46:31.914
Fight back! Fight me!

46:31.956 --> 46:33.958
Stop this now. Get off me.

46:33.999 --> 46:35.293
Make me!

46:36.252 --> 46:37.545
Make me!

46:40.839 --> 46:42.759
- Make me!
- Get off me!

46:43.718 --> 46:45.094
Get off me!

46:48.640 --> 46:50.141
Good for you.

46:50.182 --> 46:52.809
Good for you.
Now, doesn't that feel better?

46:53.810 --> 46:56.355
To fight back?

46:56.397 --> 46:59.525
Linda, you're a stronger woman
than you know.

46:59.567 --> 47:01.486
You think the world
is pushing against you.

47:01.527 --> 47:02.903
And you know what? Maybe it is.

47:02.945 --> 47:06.783
But it hurts me
to watch you not push back.

47:08.701 --> 47:10.911
You can take control
of your life again.

47:13.289 --> 47:15.040
What, are you out of your mind?

47:15.082 --> 47:18.002
Maybe. Little bit.

47:19.003 --> 47:21.798
I'm sorry. I am.

47:21.838 --> 47:23.466
I didn't hurt you, did I?

47:25.510 --> 47:29.138
Good. I just wanna help you
find your strength.

47:29.180 --> 47:31.974
Maybe this wasn't
the best approach, but...

47:33.184 --> 47:34.435
I'm sorry.

47:35.728 --> 47:37.146
I'm gonna go.

47:38.063 --> 47:39.982
Wait.

47:40.024 --> 47:41.400
Where are you going?

48:12.807 --> 48:14.225
Going somewhere?

48:16.686 --> 48:19.021
Well, look at you.

48:21.524 --> 48:23.844
Gonna have to meet with a client
on the other side of town.

48:29.156 --> 48:30.616
How are you feeling?

48:30.658 --> 48:32.284
- Okay.
- Yeah?

48:36.455 --> 48:38.583
Thank you for being here.

48:39.625 --> 48:41.252
And I don't just mean today.

48:43.337 --> 48:45.964
You're a really good person.

48:46.006 --> 48:47.924
Well, I'm happy you think so.

48:49.802 --> 48:52.764
- Can I ask you something?
- Anything.

48:52.805 --> 48:56.475
Why does Groves have a problem
with you?

48:56.517 --> 48:58.770
I mean,
it's not just your profession.

48:58.811 --> 49:01.105
You two clearly have a history.

49:01.146 --> 49:03.065
Yeah.

49:03.107 --> 49:05.234
Our paths
have definitely crossed.

49:06.360 --> 49:08.529
Well, what happened?

49:08.571 --> 49:10.615
There's not really much to tell.

49:11.699 --> 49:14.577
Well, I'd like to hear it.

49:14.619 --> 49:18.247
A woman hired me to find proof
of her husband's infidelity.

49:19.874 --> 49:23.544
That woman's name
was Julie Beckett.

49:23.586 --> 49:25.546
I did my job.

49:25.588 --> 49:26.923
She was about
to file for divorce

49:26.963 --> 49:28.633
and then her husband killed her.

49:28.674 --> 49:30.092
Then he skipped town.

49:30.134 --> 49:32.219
Groves headed up
that investigation.

49:34.639 --> 49:36.784
Well, why does he think
that you're some kind of threat?

49:36.808 --> 49:39.310
'Cause he's bad at his job.

49:39.351 --> 49:41.395
How so?

49:41.437 --> 49:43.397
While I was keeping tabs
on Julie's husband,

49:43.439 --> 49:46.358
I discovered
that he was also abusing her.

49:46.400 --> 49:49.236
So I confronted him,
tried to intimidate him.

49:51.155 --> 49:53.616
He responded by shooting her

49:53.658 --> 49:55.785
and then skipping town.

49:55.827 --> 49:57.662
Groves was on his trail
for weeks.

49:57.703 --> 49:59.622
But when he hit a dead-end,
he was convinced

49:59.664 --> 50:02.040
that I put him in the ground.

50:02.082 --> 50:03.876
And then he started following
some crazy tip

50:03.918 --> 50:07.003
about a body being buried
at the old canning factory.

50:07.045 --> 50:09.632
You know,
the one at the edge of town?

50:09.674 --> 50:12.217
Groves tore that place
top to bottom for days.

50:12.259 --> 50:14.279
His lieutenant finally
had to pull him off the case,

50:14.303 --> 50:19.183
but Groves...
he just couldn't let it go.

50:19.224 --> 50:21.268
And the husband never turned up?

50:22.269 --> 50:23.479
No.

50:26.858 --> 50:28.985
Hey, you can't blame yourself
for what happened.

50:29.025 --> 50:31.236
Well, it's hard
not to blame myself.

50:33.865 --> 50:37.201
I meddled and Julie got killed.

50:44.750 --> 50:47.252
All right, look,
I'm gonna get out of here.

50:47.294 --> 50:48.963
- Okay.
- I'll call you later?

50:49.005 --> 50:50.172
Mm-hmm.

50:56.345 --> 50:58.681
- You're beautiful.
- Stop.

50:58.723 --> 51:01.308
- Look at that smile.
- Oh, stop it.

51:08.315 --> 51:11.109
- You're beautiful.
- Thank you.

51:11.151 --> 51:12.611
Just the trick.

51:40.222 --> 51:41.599
- Hey.
- Hey.

51:41.640 --> 51:42.641
How are you?

51:42.683 --> 51:44.309
I'm better than yesterday.

51:53.485 --> 51:55.365
You know the good thing
about all this?

51:56.572 --> 51:58.341
Now you really have nothing
to tie you down here.

51:58.365 --> 52:01.035
Not that the antique store
was really holding you back.

52:02.160 --> 52:03.662
Yeah, I guess so.

52:05.414 --> 52:08.542
- Unless...
- Unless?

52:08.584 --> 52:11.045
Unless
there's a certain private eye

52:11.087 --> 52:12.838
who sunk his teeth into you.

52:17.051 --> 52:19.053
Uh, well, hold that thought.

52:21.513 --> 52:24.349
Wait. What do you mean,
"An attempt on his life?"

52:24.391 --> 52:26.727
I mean, he went out
to his driveway last night

52:26.769 --> 52:28.813
and his car exploded.

52:28.854 --> 52:30.940
Jesus!

52:30.982 --> 52:34.026
Thankfully,
he was using a remote starter.

52:34.068 --> 52:36.612
Well, uh, where is he?
Is he... Is he hurt?

52:36.654 --> 52:39.115
Shaken up a bit.
Aside from that, he's fine.

52:41.157 --> 52:44.202
Ms. Marshall, I need you
to tell me where Tony Sarno is.

52:44.244 --> 52:46.288
Are you accusing him
of this, too?

52:46.330 --> 52:48.140
You really don't know anything
about him, do you?

52:48.164 --> 52:49.667
I know he was a combat medic.

52:49.708 --> 52:52.252
- That's what he told you?
- Is that not true?

52:52.294 --> 52:54.964
I still have his service record
on file.

52:55.006 --> 52:58.634
Sure, he started off training
to be a combat medic.

52:58.676 --> 53:01.137
But then he went
for his Airborne qualification,

53:01.177 --> 53:04.849
ended up passing the
Special Forces selection course.

53:04.890 --> 53:06.642
Spent the remainder
of his career

53:06.684 --> 53:09.227
with a counter-terrorism group.

53:09.269 --> 53:10.896
Do you know what his role was?

53:12.606 --> 53:15.109
EOD team leader.

53:15.151 --> 53:16.902
And what's EOD?

53:16.944 --> 53:20.072
Explosive ordinance disposal.

53:21.490 --> 53:23.241
And those guys,

53:23.283 --> 53:25.953
they know a thing or two
about car bombs.

53:28.204 --> 53:31.792
So is that why you blame him
for the Julie Beckett incident?

53:33.878 --> 53:37.756
So he told you
the Tony Sarno version, did he?

53:37.798 --> 53:40.885
- You wanna know the real one?
- What do you mean?

53:40.926 --> 53:43.219
I mean, it didn't happen the way
he likes to tell it.

53:44.847 --> 53:48.308
Sarno was sleeping
with that woman.

53:48.350 --> 53:51.937
See, Mr. Beckett had hired him
to investigate his wife.

53:51.979 --> 53:53.856
Sarno got too close.

53:53.898 --> 53:56.108
Beckett found out
and attacked his wife

53:56.150 --> 53:58.485
and Sarno went for blood.

53:59.486 --> 54:01.237
Hm.

54:01.279 --> 54:03.157
Yeah, Sarno went
to take Beckett out

54:03.199 --> 54:05.743
and the wife got caught
in the crossfire.

54:05.784 --> 54:07.494
That's, uh...

54:08.787 --> 54:10.497
not what he told me.

54:10.539 --> 54:12.266
And I'm guessing he didn't
tell you about the little girl,

54:12.290 --> 54:15.002
either, did he? Yeah.

54:15.044 --> 54:17.379
Poor little thing probably
saw the whole thing go down

54:17.421 --> 54:21.175
and ran off scared and alone.

54:21.217 --> 54:24.595
We found her a week later.

54:24.636 --> 54:26.931
She was struck by a truck
on the highway.

54:30.101 --> 54:34.939
Yeah, so that girl
died because of Sarno.

54:34.980 --> 54:36.666
And then he staged
the whole thing perfectly.

54:36.690 --> 54:39.068
Made it look like
the husband went on a rampage

54:39.110 --> 54:40.861
and murdered his wife.

54:42.113 --> 54:44.448
We never did find the husband.

54:44.489 --> 54:48.744
My guess is that he's rotting
away in a ditch somewhere.

54:48.786 --> 54:50.746
Can you prove any of this?

54:51.956 --> 54:54.959
If I could,
Sarno would already be

54:55.000 --> 54:57.086
in the middle
of a life sentence.

54:59.004 --> 55:02.424
I don't understand...

55:02.466 --> 55:04.551
I get it. I really do.

55:04.593 --> 55:08.097
He's charmin',
he's protective...

55:08.139 --> 55:10.015
but he doesn't know
where the limits are,

55:10.057 --> 55:13.435
and the law
means nothing to him.

55:13.477 --> 55:14.686
And now...

55:16.438 --> 55:18.565
Now he's got his sight
set on you.

55:18.607 --> 55:21.777
He sees your ex-husband
as a threat, Ms. Marshall,

55:21.819 --> 55:25.321
and he's not gonna stop until
Eric is out of the picture.

55:25.363 --> 55:28.075
I've seen this happen before.

55:28.117 --> 55:30.035
I'm not gonna let it
happen again.

55:31.912 --> 55:33.914
So if you know where he is...

55:35.331 --> 55:37.960
now would be a good time
to tell me.

55:38.002 --> 55:39.586
I don't... I don't know.

55:40.712 --> 55:42.006
I really don't.

55:43.174 --> 55:45.592
All right.

55:45.634 --> 55:48.595
If he contacts you,
would you please let me know?

55:48.637 --> 55:50.472
- Immediately.
- Yes.

55:52.016 --> 55:53.267
Thank you both.

55:55.351 --> 55:56.478
Thank you.

56:14.330 --> 56:15.664
It's him again.

56:19.918 --> 56:21.938
You know, there is still
a chance that the detective

56:21.962 --> 56:23.379
was wrong about all this.

56:23.421 --> 56:25.799
Come on. You don't believe that.

56:25.841 --> 56:28.552
Neither do I. I just...

56:28.593 --> 56:30.804
I don't understand
how I didn't see any of this.

56:30.846 --> 56:32.681
I mean,
how could I be so stupid?

56:32.723 --> 56:37.102
Hey, stop beating yourself up.
Okay? It's not your fault.

56:37.144 --> 56:38.812
I didn't see it, either.

56:38.854 --> 56:41.148
Yeah, well,
you weren't sleeping with him.

56:41.190 --> 56:43.483
<i>You know,</i>

56:43.525 --> 56:48.572
<i>in a really,
really sick and twisted way,</i>

56:48.613 --> 56:51.742
he was trying to be
your guardian angel.

56:52.910 --> 56:55.871
Ugh, that is not helpful.

56:55.913 --> 56:58.582
Okay, but it's true.

56:58.623 --> 57:00.476
And, hey, at least you know
he's not gonna hurt you.

57:00.500 --> 57:02.378
How? How do I know that?

57:02.418 --> 57:04.171
I mean,
he could be a psychopath.

57:06.631 --> 57:09.218
There's only one thing to do.

57:09.260 --> 57:10.719
You have to break it off.

57:12.428 --> 57:15.391
I-I mean, if he's that unstable,
then what if he tries something

57:15.431 --> 57:17.059
when I break it off?

57:19.937 --> 57:23.148
Okay. Here's what you do.

57:23.190 --> 57:26.484
You break up by phone,
not face to face.

57:26.526 --> 57:29.154
And then you hide out
for a few weeks...

57:29.196 --> 57:32.908
<i>sell this place
and get out of here for good.</i>

57:41.625 --> 57:43.085
Okay.

57:43.127 --> 57:45.503
Okay. You're right.

57:47.339 --> 57:51.176
Yes. I am right.
Of course, I'm right.

57:51.218 --> 57:52.886
When am I not right?

57:54.346 --> 57:57.224
Okay, except for the time
I told you

57:57.266 --> 58:00.227
to date
the crazy private investigator.

58:00.269 --> 58:02.313
Okay.

58:02.354 --> 58:04.231
<i>Well, what about you, then?</i>

58:05.149 --> 58:06.275
<i>What about me?</i>

58:07.525 --> 58:11.196
I mean, would you come with me?

58:12.114 --> 58:13.824
Oh.

58:13.865 --> 58:16.327
I never...
I never considered it.

58:17.953 --> 58:20.705
Consider it now.
I mean, what's holding you back?

58:20.747 --> 58:22.540
Nothing.

58:25.836 --> 58:28.005
Nothing's holding me back.

58:28.046 --> 58:29.798
Heh. Okay.

58:29.840 --> 58:33.844
I think we just decided
to move together.

58:37.889 --> 58:40.476
Yeah. I think we did.

58:43.937 --> 58:45.147
Here.

58:47.441 --> 58:49.276
To new beginnings.

58:50.861 --> 58:52.237
New beginnings.

59:12.424 --> 59:15.844
You think we should take
both cars or, um...

59:15.886 --> 59:17.679
Mm. I actually
wanted to sell my car.

59:17.721 --> 59:19.782
- That's true. That's actually a really good idea.
- Yeah.

59:19.806 --> 59:22.286
We should find a place to stay
before we start going out there.

59:23.060 --> 59:24.228
Linda.

59:25.854 --> 59:28.482
- Are you there?
- Don't answer.

59:28.524 --> 59:31.651
Linda, come on.
I know that you're here.

59:31.693 --> 59:33.820
I mean, the lights are on.
He knows we're here.

59:34.905 --> 59:36.490
Will you tell me
what's going on?

59:36.532 --> 59:38.575
- I'll call the police.
- Okay.

59:38.616 --> 59:40.536
Do it from the kitchen
so he doesn't see...

59:51.963 --> 59:53.631
Will you please open the door?

59:57.428 --> 59:58.678
No.

59:59.763 --> 01:00:01.848
What's happening?

01:00:01.890 --> 01:00:04.684
I think we need to spend
some time apart.

01:00:05.685 --> 01:00:06.895
What?

01:00:08.313 --> 01:00:09.647
Where is this coming from?

01:00:09.689 --> 01:00:11.567
Just yesterday
we had an amazing day. Why...

01:00:11.649 --> 01:00:14.111
Okay, stop the charade,
all right?

01:00:14.152 --> 01:00:15.404
What charade?

01:00:16.905 --> 01:00:19.533
Eric's car exploded last night.

01:00:19.575 --> 01:00:21.159
Linda, I'm telling you,

01:00:21.201 --> 01:00:24.037
I have absolutely no idea...
Um...

01:00:24.079 --> 01:00:26.248
Why would somebody
blow up his car?

01:00:26.290 --> 01:00:28.208
Okay, stop lying to me.

01:00:31.211 --> 01:00:33.464
Just like you lied to me
about Julie Beckett.

01:00:42.931 --> 01:00:44.349
Did Groves tell you that?

01:00:46.393 --> 01:00:49.146
Well, it's true, isn't it?
I mean, you got her killed.

01:00:49.187 --> 01:00:50.522
I did not.

01:00:53.400 --> 01:00:55.777
But, yes, I did lie to you.

01:00:57.613 --> 01:01:01.617
It didn't happen exactly
the way that I say it did.

01:01:04.286 --> 01:01:06.246
But how could I tell you
the truth?

01:01:07.705 --> 01:01:09.291
If you found out...

01:01:11.793 --> 01:01:13.504
that I had an affair with her,

01:01:13.545 --> 01:01:15.064
I was afraid
that you would push me away

01:01:15.088 --> 01:01:16.840
just like you are right now.

01:01:18.883 --> 01:01:21.178
But I didn't kill anyone.

01:01:21.219 --> 01:01:23.805
Julie's husband came after me
with a gun...

01:01:26.683 --> 01:01:28.644
and Julie stepped in the way.

01:01:33.482 --> 01:01:35.984
She died in my arms
as he ran away.

01:01:36.026 --> 01:01:37.735
And I haven't seen him
again since.

01:01:37.777 --> 01:01:39.154
And that is the truth.

01:01:40.864 --> 01:01:43.200
How can I believe anything
that you tell me?

01:01:43.241 --> 01:01:46.495
You really think that I tried
to kill your ex-husband?

01:01:48.246 --> 01:01:50.957
Yeah. Well,
you have explosives experience.

01:01:50.999 --> 01:01:52.250
Just another lie.

01:01:52.292 --> 01:01:53.793
I didn't lie about that.

01:01:55.753 --> 01:01:58.173
I just left that part out.

01:01:58.215 --> 01:02:00.008
You really wanna hear
about everything

01:02:00.050 --> 01:02:01.593
that I did in the army?

01:02:01.635 --> 01:02:04.137
Anybody can learn
to blow a gas tank online.

01:02:04.179 --> 01:02:05.430
Stop!

01:02:10.143 --> 01:02:13.021
I'm sorry, I just...
I can't trust you anymore.

01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:15.815
Hey, they're on their way.

01:02:21.946 --> 01:02:23.448
You called the police?

01:02:24.741 --> 01:02:26.201
On me?

01:02:32.541 --> 01:02:34.334
You're makin' a mistake, Linda.

01:03:06.116 --> 01:03:09.453
Thank you, Officer. Bye.

01:03:16.084 --> 01:03:17.502
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:03:20.171 --> 01:03:23.091
Thank you so much
for staying the night again.

01:03:23.133 --> 01:03:26.886
- Um, it really means a lot.
- Yeah, it's what I'm here for.

01:03:28.305 --> 01:03:32.434
Hey, we're gonna
figure this out, okay?

01:03:33.935 --> 01:03:35.103
Come here.

01:03:36.146 --> 01:03:37.564
Don't cry.

01:03:38.565 --> 01:03:39.983
It's gonna be okay.

01:03:40.024 --> 01:03:41.985
Thanks.

01:03:42.026 --> 01:03:43.903
I love you.

01:03:47.157 --> 01:03:48.366
Okay.

01:03:50.160 --> 01:03:52.287
- Good night.
- Good night.

01:04:55.433 --> 01:04:56.601
Carrie?

01:05:04.735 --> 01:05:06.236
<i>Hey, it's me.</i>

01:05:06.277 --> 01:05:07.571
<i>Wanted to let you sleep in.</i>

01:05:07.612 --> 01:05:08.840
<i>I'm off to the shop to tell Bob</i>

01:05:08.864 --> 01:05:10.448
<i>that I am quitting.</i>

01:05:10.490 --> 01:05:12.116
<i>Maybe I can scrounge up
some empty boxes</i>

01:05:12.158 --> 01:05:13.618
<i>from the storage room.</i>

01:05:13.660 --> 01:05:15.537
<i>If not, I'll pick some up
on my way back</i>

01:05:15.579 --> 01:05:16.830
<i>and help you start packing.</i>

01:05:16.872 --> 01:05:19.541
<i>So get that listing fixed, okay?</i>

01:05:19.583 --> 01:05:23.670
<i>Let's sell that sucker.
I'll see you soon. Okay? Bye.</i>

01:06:28.985 --> 01:06:30.278
Hm...

01:06:35.951 --> 01:06:38.286
<i>Hi,
it's Carrie. Leave a message.</i>

01:06:38.328 --> 01:06:40.747
Hey, uh, it's me.

01:06:40.789 --> 01:06:41.974
I thought you were coming
straight back here.

01:06:41.998 --> 01:06:44.250
I made lunch. Call me.

01:07:14.489 --> 01:07:15.699
Carrie?

01:07:24.666 --> 01:07:26.226
Carrie?

01:07:36.511 --> 01:07:38.405
<i>Hi,
it's Carrie. Leave a message.</i>

01:07:38.429 --> 01:07:41.558
Hey, it's me again
for, like, the fifth time.

01:07:41.599 --> 01:07:43.476
Where are you?

01:07:43.518 --> 01:07:46.688
The sun's going down, you were
supposed to be back hours ago.

01:07:47.731 --> 01:07:50.400
I'm really starting to worry.

01:07:50.441 --> 01:07:52.569
Look, if you get this,
can you just call me, please?

01:07:52.610 --> 01:07:53.820
Please.

01:08:09.126 --> 01:08:11.337
<i>Hi,
it's Carrie. Leave a message.</i>

01:08:11.379 --> 01:08:13.172
Carrie, it's me again.

01:08:13.214 --> 01:08:15.675
I don't know what to do,
except to keep calling you.

01:08:15.717 --> 01:08:17.218
So if you get these,

01:08:17.260 --> 01:08:19.845
I-I mean, please give me
a call back.

01:08:19.888 --> 01:08:22.098
I can't believe
I can't get a hold of you.

01:08:25.350 --> 01:08:27.310
Tony?

01:08:27.353 --> 01:08:29.064
No.

01:08:29.104 --> 01:08:32.316
Linda, it's okay.

01:08:32.358 --> 01:08:34.903
- It's okay. It's me.
- No, please, don't.

01:08:35.987 --> 01:08:37.238
It's me.

01:09:51.187 --> 01:09:52.897
Sure.

01:09:52.939 --> 01:09:55.150
Thanks, guys.

01:10:00.905 --> 01:10:02.907
We did a full sweep
of the entire house.

01:10:02.949 --> 01:10:06.494
Didn't find
any other listening devices.

01:10:06.536 --> 01:10:09.706
Okay. Do you know how long
that thing was in my house?

01:10:09.747 --> 01:10:11.457
Hard to say.

01:10:11.499 --> 01:10:14.127
But it's over now. All right?

01:10:14.169 --> 01:10:16.629
And we've doubled down
on our search.

01:10:16.671 --> 01:10:19.757
We will find him.

01:10:19.799 --> 01:10:22.719
But until we do, I can have
officers posted outside

01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:24.804
day and night if you'd like.

01:10:24.846 --> 01:10:26.848
Yes. Please.

01:10:26.890 --> 01:10:28.141
Okay.

01:10:29.517 --> 01:10:31.895
Have you had any other contact
with Sarno

01:10:31.936 --> 01:10:35.773
since he last showed up
at your front door?

01:10:35.815 --> 01:10:37.108
No.

01:10:37.150 --> 01:10:38.985
You did the right thing,
you know,

01:10:39.027 --> 01:10:40.444
calling us.

01:10:40.486 --> 01:10:42.072
I know it's a scary situation,

01:10:42.113 --> 01:10:45.909
but we're here
to help you through it.

01:10:45.950 --> 01:10:48.285
Thank you.

01:10:48.327 --> 01:10:50.997
Um, Detective, my friend Carrie,

01:10:51.039 --> 01:10:54.084
I-I haven't been able
to get a hold of her.

01:10:54.125 --> 01:10:55.960
I mean, I-I've left her
a ton of voicemails.

01:10:56.002 --> 01:10:58.713
I've... I went to her apartment
to find her,

01:10:58.755 --> 01:11:01.340
but I just found some cardboard
boxes that I think were hers.

01:11:01.382 --> 01:11:04.802
- When did you last see her?
- Um, two nights ago.

01:11:04.844 --> 01:11:06.846
She spent the night here.

01:11:06.888 --> 01:11:09.224
She left the next morning,
said she was gonna quit her job.

01:11:09.265 --> 01:11:11.392
But she never came back.

01:11:11.434 --> 01:11:12.894
Now, why was she gonna
quit her job?

01:11:12.936 --> 01:11:14.812
With everything
that's happening here,

01:11:14.854 --> 01:11:16.940
we decided we were gonna
leave town together.

01:11:19.192 --> 01:11:21.444
And this plan that you had to...

01:11:21.485 --> 01:11:25.322
Did you discuss it here,
in the house?

01:11:25.364 --> 01:11:26.824
Oh, my God.

01:11:28.451 --> 01:11:32.205
Oh, my God, he heard us.
Oh, my God, he's gonna kill her.

01:11:32.247 --> 01:11:33.915
- He's, he...
- No, no, wait a minute.

01:11:33.957 --> 01:11:36.459
We don't know that.
We don't know anything yet.

01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:38.586
I will look into it,
I promise you that.

01:11:38.628 --> 01:11:39.897
In fact,
the minute I leave here,

01:11:39.921 --> 01:11:41.672
I will head down
to the antique store

01:11:41.714 --> 01:11:43.549
and see if anyone saw her
come or go.

01:11:43.591 --> 01:11:46.010
- Thank you.
- But in the meanwhile...

01:11:46.052 --> 01:11:47.804
As a precaution,
it might be best

01:11:47.845 --> 01:11:50.098
to get you to a safer location.

01:11:50.140 --> 01:11:51.641
- All right?
- Okay.

01:11:51.682 --> 01:11:53.559
Would you be okay with that?

01:11:55.228 --> 01:11:56.771
Yeah.

01:11:56.813 --> 01:11:58.606
I'm gonna go outside
and coordinate

01:11:58.648 --> 01:12:00.275
with the other officers,
all right?

01:12:00.316 --> 01:12:03.360
Pack some things, whatever
you think you might need.

01:12:03.402 --> 01:12:05.404
- I'll be right back.
- Okay, thank you.

01:12:18.251 --> 01:12:21.420
- Carrie?
- Linda...

01:12:21.462 --> 01:12:23.881
Oh, my God.
Where the hell are you?

01:12:23.923 --> 01:12:27.718
<i>Linda...</i>
Oh, my God! Are you okay?

01:12:27.760 --> 01:12:29.262
<i>No, uh, I'm not.</i>

01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:31.931
Carrie?

01:12:31.973 --> 01:12:33.724
<i>He doesn't want to hurt you.</i>

01:12:33.766 --> 01:12:36.102
<i>He just wants to speak to you.</i>

01:12:36.144 --> 01:12:37.937
<i>He wants you to meet him here.</i>

01:12:37.979 --> 01:12:39.480
W-w-where? Where?

01:12:39.522 --> 01:12:41.649
<i>At the old canning factory.</i>

01:12:41.691 --> 01:12:44.735
<i>He said
you would know what that meant.</i>

01:12:44.777 --> 01:12:46.529
Uh, yeah. I do, I do.

01:12:46.570 --> 01:12:48.281
<i>You have one hour.</i>

01:12:48.323 --> 01:12:50.325
<i>If you don't make it in time</i>

01:12:50.366 --> 01:12:52.118
<i>or if you bring the police,</i>

01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:54.162
<i>he's gonna k-kill me.</i>

01:12:54.204 --> 01:12:56.747
<i>He wants you to say
that you understand.</i>

01:12:56.789 --> 01:12:58.582
Yes, I understand.

01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:00.793
I'll be right there, okay?

01:13:02.253 --> 01:13:04.172
Ca...

01:13:06.341 --> 01:13:07.842
So we're all set.

01:13:09.510 --> 01:13:11.304
You okay?

01:13:11.346 --> 01:13:14.724
Oh, y-yeah,
you-you just, uh, startled me.

01:13:14.765 --> 01:13:17.101
All right,
I'm off to the antique store.

01:13:17.143 --> 01:13:18.954
As soon as I learn something,
I'll let you know.

01:13:18.978 --> 01:13:21.105
The officers outside
will take care of you.

01:13:21.147 --> 01:13:22.606
Ready to go?

01:13:22.648 --> 01:13:24.234
Um, I-I just need
a few more minutes.

01:13:24.275 --> 01:13:26.777
All right.
You sure you're all right?

01:13:26.819 --> 01:13:29.030
Yes. Yeah, I'm fine. Thank you.

01:13:29.072 --> 01:13:30.156
Okay.

01:14:52.696 --> 01:14:54.031
Carrie?

01:15:04.083 --> 01:15:05.376
Carrie?

01:15:30.693 --> 01:15:31.735
Carrie...

01:15:38.826 --> 01:15:40.828
I-I'm sorry. I'm so sorry.

01:15:40.870 --> 01:15:42.497
You have nothing
to be sorry for, okay?

01:15:42.538 --> 01:15:45.291
I'm gonna get you out of here,
okay? Are you hurt?

01:15:45.333 --> 01:15:47.584
- Just-just scared.
- Okay.

01:16:01.224 --> 01:16:04.268
God!

01:16:07.813 --> 01:16:09.148
Linda, please...

01:16:14.611 --> 01:16:16.613
Linda!

01:16:16.655 --> 01:16:18.199
No!

01:16:19.158 --> 01:16:20.158
No!

01:16:39.678 --> 01:16:41.597
Eric?

01:16:41.638 --> 01:16:43.474
What the hell are you doing?

01:16:43.516 --> 01:16:45.393
You want to tell her
or should I?

01:16:46.643 --> 01:16:47.770
Huh, Tony?

01:16:48.771 --> 01:16:50.273
Hm?

01:16:50.314 --> 01:16:52.024
Hm?

01:16:52.066 --> 01:16:53.317
Speak.

01:16:57.447 --> 01:16:59.198
It wasn't me, Linda.

01:17:00.157 --> 01:17:01.534
It was never me.

01:17:05.455 --> 01:17:07.664
It was him.

01:17:07.706 --> 01:17:11.627
What? I-I-I, I don't understand.

01:17:11.668 --> 01:17:14.171
A month ago,
Eric's company hired me

01:17:14.213 --> 01:17:18.175
to look into
an, an embezzling problem.

01:17:18.217 --> 01:17:19.945
Somebody had been siphoning off
a lot of money

01:17:19.969 --> 01:17:21.471
from their accounts.

01:17:21.512 --> 01:17:23.347
And he was their prime suspect.

01:17:25.391 --> 01:17:27.893
Then he caught wind
that I was on his tail.

01:17:27.935 --> 01:17:30.396
After the explosion,
I finally figured out his plan.

01:17:30.438 --> 01:17:32.165
He was gathering
all the information he could

01:17:32.189 --> 01:17:34.817
so he could frame me for murder.

01:17:34.858 --> 01:17:36.360
With me out of the picture,

01:17:36.402 --> 01:17:39.405
nobody could deliver the proof
to the company.

01:17:39.447 --> 01:17:42.241
And the only way for him to get
the money back on the books

01:17:42.283 --> 01:17:44.285
was for you to sell the house.

01:17:47.455 --> 01:17:49.999
You hired Carl Ruston

01:17:50.040 --> 01:17:52.418
to scare her off, didn't you?

01:17:52.460 --> 01:17:54.504
Some people would do anything
for a buck.

01:17:56.297 --> 01:17:59.175
So at the bar,
that wasn't a coincidence?

01:18:01.594 --> 01:18:02.803
No.

01:18:04.138 --> 01:18:07.141
I was gathering information
on him.

01:18:07.183 --> 01:18:09.268
I needed to see
if you knew anything,

01:18:09.310 --> 01:18:12.104
so I could use it against him.

01:18:12.146 --> 01:18:15.065
And that's why
I bugged your house.

01:18:16.275 --> 01:18:19.736
And I just... I just didn't...

01:18:19.778 --> 01:18:21.989
He didn't expect
to be so taken with you.

01:18:22.031 --> 01:18:24.325
Right?

01:18:24.367 --> 01:18:26.869
First Julie Beckett, now Linda?

01:18:26.910 --> 01:18:28.829
You got a real problem,
don't you?

01:18:30.956 --> 01:18:34.084
I didn't expect you to go
into hiding so quickly, though.

01:18:34.126 --> 01:18:35.670
That was pretty slick.

01:18:35.711 --> 01:18:37.672
But then I knew
I had to make it look like

01:18:37.713 --> 01:18:39.256
more than attempted murder.

01:18:39.298 --> 01:18:41.842
I knew you'd follow Linda
wherever she went

01:18:41.884 --> 01:18:43.678
because you're a little psycho.

01:18:45.388 --> 01:18:47.640
So we return
to the scene of the crime.

01:18:48.724 --> 01:18:50.726
Nothing ever happened here.

01:18:53.396 --> 01:18:55.939
Yeah. It makes for a good story.

01:18:57.983 --> 01:19:00.236
You know, Carrie...

01:19:00.277 --> 01:19:02.905
- I never really liked you.
- No, no, please don't...

01:19:02.946 --> 01:19:04.365
No, no, no, stop.
Please, please!

01:19:04.407 --> 01:19:06.825
Eric, please stop!
You cannot do this.

01:19:06.867 --> 01:19:08.595
I will tell the truth. I will
tell the police everything.

01:19:08.619 --> 01:19:12.456
- I swear.
- Then I'll have to kill you, too.

01:19:12.498 --> 01:19:15.918
I loved you,
but you're leaving me no choice.

01:19:15.959 --> 01:19:18.087
You're just gonna kill us all?

01:19:18.128 --> 01:19:19.630
For money?

01:19:19.672 --> 01:19:21.215
It's not just for money, stupid.

01:19:21.257 --> 01:19:22.526
If my company finds out
what I did,

01:19:22.550 --> 01:19:23.884
I'm gonna go to jail.

01:19:23.926 --> 01:19:26.512
I can't let that happen.

01:19:26.554 --> 01:19:28.639
Goodbye, Carrie.

01:19:31.100 --> 01:19:33.102
No!

01:19:46.657 --> 01:19:48.659
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

01:19:50.578 --> 01:19:52.329
Yeah.

01:19:54.081 --> 01:19:55.892
It's gonna be okay. We're gonna
get out of here, okay?

01:19:55.916 --> 01:19:57.543
Okay.

01:19:57.585 --> 01:19:58.794
Can you walk?

01:19:58.835 --> 01:20:00.504
I'm okay.

01:20:06.594 --> 01:20:08.137
No, no, Linda.
No, no, no. Linda...

01:20:08.178 --> 01:20:10.598
I'll be right back, okay?
Stay there.

01:20:22.568 --> 01:20:25.195
I told you, I know how to win.

01:20:29.032 --> 01:20:30.326
Linda!

01:20:31.786 --> 01:20:34.037
I can hear you.

01:20:34.079 --> 01:20:36.499
You're gonna have to come out
if you wanna save your friend.

01:20:41.295 --> 01:20:43.547
You know, Linda,
I finally realized

01:20:43.589 --> 01:20:44.840
why I stopped loving you.

01:20:46.925 --> 01:20:49.595
It's 'cause you don't know
how to fight for anything.

01:20:49.637 --> 01:20:52.264
Things start to fall apart
and you just stand there...

01:20:53.932 --> 01:20:56.352
like you're gonna stand there
while I pull this trigger.

01:21:00.022 --> 01:21:02.858
Wait... Silence.

01:21:02.899 --> 01:21:05.319
You hear that ringing
in your ears?

01:21:06.320 --> 01:21:07.655
What ringing?

01:21:14.495 --> 01:21:15.871
That ringing.

01:21:21.001 --> 01:21:23.086
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

01:21:23.128 --> 01:21:24.547
Six out of ten.

01:21:24.588 --> 01:21:27.424
This isn't gonna work out,
is it?

01:21:27.466 --> 01:21:29.301
You and me?

01:21:29.343 --> 01:21:32.513
- No, I don't think so.
- Damn.

01:21:32.555 --> 01:21:34.973
Eric was right about one thing.

01:21:35.015 --> 01:21:37.934
Yeah? What's that?

01:21:37.976 --> 01:21:41.731
You are a little nuts.

01:21:41.772 --> 01:21:44.358
Yeah. Maybe a little bit.

01:21:44.400 --> 01:21:47.611
If I can go back and change
a few things, I would.

01:21:47.653 --> 01:21:51.490
Yeah. Well, we all have regrets.

01:21:52.825 --> 01:21:55.661
But that's what makes us
stronger, right?

01:21:55.703 --> 01:21:56.871
Right.

01:21:58.163 --> 01:22:00.290
We should get you to a hospital.

01:22:00.332 --> 01:22:02.459
Yeah.

01:22:02.501 --> 01:22:05.796
Let me help you.

01:22:05.838 --> 01:22:08.883
I think I'm just gonna wait
right here.

01:22:08.924 --> 01:22:10.885
Linda? Linda.

01:22:10.926 --> 01:22:12.762
Oh, Carrie.

01:22:12.803 --> 01:22:14.513
Hey.

01:22:16.265 --> 01:22:17.474
It's okay.

01:22:20.143 --> 01:22:23.397
So... how are you feelin'?

01:22:23.439 --> 01:22:24.815
Relieved.

01:22:26.692 --> 01:22:29.779
I was asking more
about your physical condition.

01:22:29.820 --> 01:22:31.071
But that's good to hear.

01:22:31.113 --> 01:22:32.549
Thank you so much
for all of your help

01:22:32.573 --> 01:22:34.283
during all this.

01:22:34.324 --> 01:22:38.328
I realize I wasn't the most
cooperative when we first met.

01:22:38.370 --> 01:22:40.247
You know, um,

01:22:40.289 --> 01:22:43.500
looks like I was wrong...
this time.

01:22:46.962 --> 01:22:48.607
Well, I don't think
he'll take it personally.

01:22:48.631 --> 01:22:50.215
Huh.

01:22:50.257 --> 01:22:52.635
You still have your suspicions
about him, don't you?

01:22:52.676 --> 01:22:54.470
I don't think
I'll ever crack the mystery

01:22:54.511 --> 01:22:56.972
that is Tony Sarno.

01:22:58.474 --> 01:23:01.769
Well, he's probably
a little unstable,

01:23:01.811 --> 01:23:04.354
but... at the end of the day,

01:23:04.396 --> 01:23:06.607
I think he's not such a bad guy.

01:23:06.649 --> 01:23:07.900
Maybe.

01:23:09.693 --> 01:23:12.863
Ladies, it was a pleasure.

01:23:17.033 --> 01:23:18.160
Stay well.

01:23:58.575 --> 01:24:00.118
Hey. Is this everything?

01:24:00.160 --> 01:24:02.287
Yup. That's everything.

01:24:02.329 --> 01:24:05.415
- Then it's time.
- Yeah, I guess so.

01:24:05.457 --> 01:24:07.417
Anything you want to say?

01:24:07.459 --> 01:24:09.044
Good riddance, Somerset Bay.

01:24:09.085 --> 01:24:10.963
Yeah.

01:24:12.381 --> 01:24:14.424
You know,
I just thought of something.

01:24:14.466 --> 01:24:15.759
Hm?

01:24:15.801 --> 01:24:17.594
We've never been
on a road trip together.

01:24:17.636 --> 01:24:21.056
So what if we get sick
of each other?

01:24:21.097 --> 01:24:23.058
Well, I mean, it is my car,

01:24:23.099 --> 01:24:24.870
so if you get too annoying,
I can just drop you off

01:24:24.894 --> 01:24:26.729
on the interstate
and you can hitch.

01:24:26.770 --> 01:24:29.231
- Okay. You would never do that.
- Simple solution.

01:24:37.781 --> 01:24:39.491
It's a male in his 50s.

01:24:39.533 --> 01:24:42.160
Looks like he's been dead
for a while.

01:24:42.202 --> 01:24:43.662
<i>Do you have an ID?</i>

01:24:43.704 --> 01:24:46.331
No, but I found a credit card.

01:24:46.373 --> 01:24:50.794
Name is, uh, Carl Ruston.

01:24:50.836 --> 01:24:52.295
Hey, did you ever hear from Tony

01:24:52.337 --> 01:24:53.773
since he was released
from the hospital?

01:24:53.797 --> 01:24:55.090
No.

01:24:55.131 --> 01:24:57.051
I... I called him
and left a message,

01:24:57.092 --> 01:24:58.969
but he never called me back.

01:25:00.554 --> 01:25:02.932
I think he's trying
to keep his distance.

01:25:02.973 --> 01:25:04.140
It's probably for the best.

01:25:06.685 --> 01:25:07.996
So can we stop for lunch?

01:25:08.020 --> 01:25:10.313
Well, we just got on the road.

01:25:10.355 --> 01:25:13.108
Well, I'm starving.

01:25:13.149 --> 01:25:15.003
Come on, get
your hitchhiker's thumb ready.

01:25:15.027 --> 01:25:16.612
Shut up.
