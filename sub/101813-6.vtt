HIGGINS:
I mean, I'm not surprised that
you ran out of petrol, again,

00:24.111 --> 00:26.504
because you forgot
to fill up the Ferrari again.

00:26.548 --> 00:28.158
I feel like
there's a "but" coming.

00:28.202 --> 00:30.726
But, Magnum, could you not even
put in a quarter of a tank?

00:30.769 --> 00:33.381
That's what I did.
I-I put in a quarter of a tank.

00:33.424 --> 00:35.905
When?Last time I had money.

00:35.948 --> 00:36.906
Right.

00:36.949 --> 00:38.386
At least I got
the gas can, though.

00:38.429 --> 00:42.085
Yeah, you keep a ten
dollar can of petrol

00:42.129 --> 00:45.784
in a $200,000 car, which
actually means you plan

00:45.828 --> 00:48.222
on being a cheap idiot
and running out of petrol.

00:48.265 --> 00:49.571
I guess now
is kind of a bad time

00:49.614 --> 00:52.095
to ask to carry the can
for a little while?

00:52.139 --> 00:53.749
All right. I got it.

00:53.792 --> 00:56.404
We're still three kilometers
from the nearest petrol station,

00:56.447 --> 00:58.232
meanwhile the Ferrari
is abandoned

00:58.275 --> 00:59.581
on the side of the road.

00:59.624 --> 01:01.539
Relax. No one's
gonna mess with it.

01:01.583 --> 01:03.150
You left it in
a no-parking zone, Magnum.

01:03.193 --> 01:04.760
Yeah, on the west side.

01:04.803 --> 01:08.155
I have literally never even seen
a tow truck on the west side.

01:08.198 --> 01:11.810
I mean, i-it's highly unlikely.

01:15.814 --> 01:17.294
Hey!

01:22.256 --> 01:23.735
Where were we?

01:23.779 --> 01:26.434
Well, you were saying
how not only are you going

01:26.477 --> 01:29.132
to replenish the petrol,
but you'll also be paying

01:29.176 --> 01:32.440
the towing fees, the impound
fees and the parking citations.

01:32.483 --> 01:35.095
Hmm, that doesn't sound
like something I would say.

01:35.138 --> 01:36.444
<i>[laughter]</i>

01:36.487 --> 01:38.576
So, how'd you pay
for all those fees?

01:38.620 --> 01:42.276
Oh, excellent question,
Maleah. Magnum?

01:42.319 --> 01:43.799
Uh, it's a long story.

01:43.842 --> 01:44.756
Not really.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.541
The Ferrari's in an impound lot

01:46.584 --> 01:48.804
until Thomas can afford
to get it out.

01:48.847 --> 01:50.284
When you say it out loud,
I guess

01:50.327 --> 01:51.589
it's not that long of a story.

01:51.633 --> 01:52.808
[laughs]
KUMU:
Ms. Higgins

01:52.851 --> 01:54.897
refused to cover
Thomas this time

01:54.940 --> 01:57.639
so it's just sitting
there, accruing interest.

01:57.682 --> 02:00.163
Thomas, "interest" is a set rate

02:00.207 --> 02:02.861
that they add to the fixed
amount you already owe.

02:02.905 --> 02:05.212
[laughs]
You guys are too funny.

02:05.255 --> 02:06.648
[laughs]

02:07.779 --> 02:09.825
Well, can't you just
use a credit card?

02:09.868 --> 02:11.392
HIGGINS:
Oh, no, no, he can't.

02:11.435 --> 02:13.089
You see, Thomas has
two credit cards,

02:13.133 --> 02:14.482
one of which is maxed out,

02:14.525 --> 02:17.006
and the other of which
he uses to pick

02:17.049 --> 02:18.312
simple knob locks.

02:18.355 --> 02:20.183
[laughs] Man,
picking locks, solving cases.

02:20.227 --> 02:22.490
Being a private investigator
sounds pretty cool.

02:22.533 --> 02:24.013
It has its moments.

02:24.056 --> 02:25.319
KELVIN:
I got to say, I think
what you do is awesome.

02:25.362 --> 02:27.973
Helping people the police can't?

02:28.017 --> 02:29.323
You guys are heroes.

02:29.366 --> 02:31.281
No, seriously.
You are.

02:31.325 --> 02:32.500
HIGGINS:
Well, that's very kind of you.

02:32.543 --> 02:33.892
Hey, since
we're down here,

02:33.936 --> 02:35.503
would you guys like
a tour of the cellar?

02:35.546 --> 02:36.504
That would be amazing.

02:36.547 --> 02:37.853
Yeah, sure, we'd love it.

02:37.896 --> 02:38.984
Yeah? Follow me.

02:44.686 --> 02:45.904
I know what you're gonna say.

02:45.948 --> 02:47.993
What?You don't like him.

02:48.037 --> 02:49.778
Of course I don't.

02:49.821 --> 02:51.997
He's a classic Eddie Haskell.

02:52.041 --> 02:53.999
<i>Leave It to Beaver?</i>

02:54.043 --> 02:58.352
Eddie Haskell was always polite
and respectful on the surface,

02:58.395 --> 02:59.701
but it was all a front.

02:59.744 --> 03:01.224
He was always
up to no good.

03:01.268 --> 03:04.314
I don't know, I'm suspicious.

03:04.358 --> 03:06.186
I think he's just a nervous kid

03:06.229 --> 03:08.013
who's trying too hard
to make a good impression.

03:08.057 --> 03:09.406
Look, your situation

03:09.450 --> 03:12.104
with Maleah is... unique.

03:12.148 --> 03:14.019
You mean other women
wouldn't make friends

03:14.063 --> 03:16.152
with their late husband's
love child?

03:16.196 --> 03:17.719
No, no. Probably not.

03:17.762 --> 03:20.156
[laughs softly]But I was gonna say,
I think, you know,

03:20.200 --> 03:22.332
Maleah's the closest thing
you have to a daughter

03:22.376 --> 03:24.552
a-and you're just
being overprotective.

03:24.595 --> 03:27.032
No, it's intuition.

03:27.076 --> 03:30.906
I just can't shake the feeling
that boy can't be trusted.

03:41.090 --> 03:42.831
Hello.

03:42.874 --> 03:44.180
Hey.What's going on here?

03:44.224 --> 03:46.095
You guys studying for an SAT?

03:46.138 --> 03:47.575
Ha-ha, very funny.

03:47.618 --> 03:49.229
Just going over these numbers.

03:49.272 --> 03:51.361
And how are they?RICK: We were well
on our way back

03:51.405 --> 03:54.408
before the hurricane, with,
um, a few exceptions.

03:54.451 --> 03:56.758
Okay, what's this? "M.T."?

03:56.801 --> 03:58.238
Seems like your greatest
quarterly loss.

03:58.281 --> 03:59.891
[calculator clacking]

03:59.935 --> 04:01.763
Magnum's tab.Magnum's tab.

04:01.806 --> 04:04.592
Which I will settle up
after my next job.

04:04.635 --> 04:06.289
You mean after you pay
the citation, towing fees

04:06.333 --> 04:08.596
and interest
to get the Ferrari out of hock.

04:08.639 --> 04:10.728
Oh, no, no, no,
he's paying us back first.

04:10.772 --> 04:12.774
Yeah, get in line.
He's owed us way longer.

04:12.817 --> 04:14.428
[laughs]
What's funny?

04:14.471 --> 04:17.387
I-I don't know, it's just nice
to be fought over, you know?

04:17.431 --> 04:18.736
TC:
Bro, we ain't fighting

04:18.780 --> 04:20.434
over you in a good way.

04:20.477 --> 04:23.611
This ain't some old-time duel
where the winner gets the girl.

04:23.654 --> 04:25.308
No, no, it's more like
a modern duel

04:25.352 --> 04:27.179
where everybody loses
because you don't pay up.

04:27.223 --> 04:29.312
Relax. I just got an urgent call
from a client

04:29.356 --> 04:33.142
and once I solve this case,
I'll settle my debts.

04:33.185 --> 04:35.362
You know, if we had
a nickel for every time

04:35.405 --> 04:36.972
you said something like that,

04:37.015 --> 04:39.191
it might actually be enough
for you to pay us back.

04:39.235 --> 04:40.715
HIGGINS:
Guys, Magnum actually
has a point.

04:40.758 --> 04:42.456
I've done some research
on the client,

04:42.499 --> 04:45.502
and to say that he has deep
pockets is an understatement.

04:45.546 --> 04:47.156
That's right.Hope so.

04:47.199 --> 04:48.897
[door bells jingle]Speaking of which...

04:50.377 --> 04:52.030
HIGGINS:
Mr. Braggs?

04:52.074 --> 04:54.032
Juliet Higgins.
Nice to meet you.

04:54.076 --> 04:56.034
Thomas Magnum.Thank you for
meeting with me.

04:56.078 --> 04:57.645
Well, it sounded
urgent on the phone.

04:57.688 --> 05:00.778
I-It's my wife Lia.
She's missing.

05:03.520 --> 05:05.174
Have you contacted HPD?

05:05.217 --> 05:08.438
Of course. But they can't help
because it hasn't been 24 hours.

05:08.482 --> 05:10.266
So when were you first aware
of her disappearance?

05:10.310 --> 05:12.355
This morning. Uh, we were
supposed to meet for brunch

05:12.399 --> 05:15.053
after her hair appointment,
but she-she never showed.

05:16.707 --> 05:18.448
She's only been gone
since this morning

05:18.492 --> 05:19.797
and yet you think she's missing?

05:19.841 --> 05:21.930
Lia would never not show
without calling.

05:21.973 --> 05:24.106
Plus, she's not
answering her texts,

05:24.149 --> 05:25.542
her phone's going
straight to voice mail,

05:25.586 --> 05:27.022
and her Friend-Finder
app is off.

05:27.065 --> 05:30.678
Listen, I'm telling you,
something is wrong.

05:30.721 --> 05:32.288
I need to find her.

05:32.332 --> 05:34.943
Whatever your fee is, I'll
double it and I'll pay up front.

05:34.986 --> 05:37.815
Well, no, there's...We're happy to accept
your offer.

05:39.991 --> 05:41.515
Look, there's got to be
a logical explanation

05:41.558 --> 05:43.212
to why Lia's missing.

05:43.255 --> 05:44.518
Uh, just give us

05:44.561 --> 05:46.041
her cell phone number,
the name of the salon,

05:46.084 --> 05:48.173
and we'll get
to the bottom of it for you.

05:48.217 --> 05:50.088
Thank you.

05:53.744 --> 05:55.659
So I guess Kamekona is now added

05:55.703 --> 05:57.879
to the growing list
of people you owe.

05:57.922 --> 06:00.664
He doesn't expect anything
for lending me his truck.

06:00.708 --> 06:02.405
Helping each other out
is what friends do.

06:02.449 --> 06:04.625
Yeah, but why is it always
your friends helping you?

06:04.668 --> 06:05.887
Plus, you were
about to sabotage

06:05.930 --> 06:07.541
a means of paying us back.

06:07.584 --> 06:09.325
I can't believe you were gonna
refuse Mr. Braggs's offer.

06:09.369 --> 06:11.240
Yeah, but why should
he pay us double?Says the man

06:11.283 --> 06:14.069
not responsible
for the upkeep of Robin's Nest.

06:14.112 --> 06:16.071
Listen, businesses
charge extra

06:16.114 --> 06:18.900
for expediting services
all the time.

06:18.943 --> 06:20.554
Yeah, and that's taking
advantage of people.

06:20.597 --> 06:22.556
I won't do that.Magnum, it was his idea.

06:22.599 --> 06:24.427
Plus, it's not like
he can't afford it.

06:24.471 --> 06:27.996
You know, let's just figure out
what happened to Lia.

06:28.039 --> 06:29.258
Okay. Her phone
is still off-line.

06:29.301 --> 06:30.868
I'm just gonna keep
monitoring it,

06:30.912 --> 06:32.043
see if it
comes on again.

06:32.087 --> 06:33.871
All right, well,
in the meantime,

06:33.915 --> 06:36.874
Colin said Lia's hair
stylist's name is T-Lo.

06:36.918 --> 06:38.702
We should probably
go from there.

06:41.052 --> 06:42.402
HIGGINS:
Excuse me.

06:42.445 --> 06:43.490
Are you T-Lo?

06:43.533 --> 06:45.535
As God made me. Sup?

06:45.579 --> 06:48.886
Thomas Magnum, Juliet Higgins.
We're private investigators.

06:48.930 --> 06:52.063
Uh, I understand that you're
Lia Braggs's hairdresser, right?

06:52.107 --> 06:54.326
I'm a colorist.Oh, colorist.

06:54.370 --> 06:55.676
Sorry. Sorry about that.

06:55.719 --> 06:57.199
It's okay. T-Lo forgives.

06:57.242 --> 06:59.288
Just, uh, don't let it
happen again.

06:59.331 --> 07:00.507
Yeah, I know Lia.

07:00.550 --> 07:02.160
I help keep her
grays on the DL,

07:02.204 --> 07:04.902
but you didn't
hear that from me.

07:04.946 --> 07:06.295
How can I help you?

07:06.338 --> 07:08.166
Well, Lia's husband thinks
she might be missing.

07:08.210 --> 07:10.604
She had an appointment with you
this morning, is that right?

07:10.647 --> 07:13.476
Yes, but she was a no-show.

07:13.520 --> 07:14.782
Really?

07:14.825 --> 07:16.610
Really.

07:16.653 --> 07:18.046
Okay, well, if Lia
did go missing,

07:18.089 --> 07:19.656
it was before this appointment.

07:19.700 --> 07:21.658
Yeah.[phone chimes]

07:23.486 --> 07:25.619
What is it?

07:25.662 --> 07:26.620
HIGGINS:
Her phone's back on.

07:26.663 --> 07:27.621
MAGNUM:
Where?

07:27.664 --> 07:29.100
Right around the corner.

07:30.537 --> 07:32.321
It's this way.

07:32.364 --> 07:34.976
Either Lia's late for
her appointment, or...

07:35.019 --> 07:36.978
Someone else has her phone.

07:39.154 --> 07:41.504
Hello, there.Hey. How you doing?

07:41.548 --> 07:43.811
That's a really nice phone.
What is that, the XR?

07:43.854 --> 07:45.073
Maybe the 11?

07:45.116 --> 07:46.944
I don't know.
You want to buy it?

07:46.988 --> 07:48.380
Look, we know the phone
belongs to someone else.

07:48.424 --> 07:51.296
I found it in the trash.
That makes it mine.

07:51.340 --> 07:53.342
Okay. We get it.

07:53.385 --> 07:55.344
You, uh, out on this street
a lot?

07:55.387 --> 07:58.129
All day, every day.
It's my block.

07:58.173 --> 08:00.349
Gets pretty territorial
out here.

08:00.392 --> 08:02.220
Did you happen to see
this woman this morning?

08:04.005 --> 08:05.441
No. Not this morning.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.964
But you do know her?

08:07.008 --> 08:08.357
Kind of.
She goes to the hair place

08:08.400 --> 08:10.185
right up there
every couple weeks.

08:10.228 --> 08:12.535
Always gives me a little
something when I see her.

08:12.579 --> 08:14.015
She sounds very generous.

08:14.058 --> 08:16.539
[chuckles] People usually look
right through me.

08:16.583 --> 08:18.889
Like I'm invisible. Not her.

08:18.933 --> 08:21.762
She told me she volunteers
at a shelter in Waikiki.

08:21.805 --> 08:26.331
Said if I ever need a place
to stay, I should go there.

08:26.375 --> 08:27.855
Wait, this is her phone?

08:28.595 --> 08:29.596
She okay?

08:29.639 --> 08:31.032
Actually, she's missing.

08:31.075 --> 08:33.034
And we're looking
for her.

08:35.602 --> 08:37.125
Here.

08:39.388 --> 08:40.868
I hope you find her.

08:40.911 --> 08:42.434
Thank you.

08:43.392 --> 08:44.828
Take care.

08:46.743 --> 08:48.397
Why would Lia
ditch her cell phone?

08:48.440 --> 08:50.965
And here of all
places. I mean,

08:51.008 --> 08:52.662

19:41.832 --> 19:44.879
But I did everything you asked.

19:44.922 --> 19:47.011
We know.

19:47.055 --> 19:49.144
You did nothing wrong.

19:49.927 --> 19:53.061
I... I'm not
second-guessing myself.

19:53.104 --> 19:55.498
I'm second-guessing
the two of you.

19:57.587 --> 19:59.415
Mr. Braggs, I'm sorry
to do this right now,

19:59.459 --> 20:01.374
but whoever is responsible
is still out there.

20:01.417 --> 20:03.767
It would be extremely helpful
if you were able

20:03.811 --> 20:05.421
to answer a few questions
for us.

20:06.814 --> 20:08.294
Listen,

20:08.337 --> 20:10.818
we're gonna get
whoever did this.

20:10.861 --> 20:12.820
Whatever it takes.

20:12.863 --> 20:15.257
I think you've done enough.

20:17.520 --> 20:20.393
If you do keep chasing this guy,
and I know you will,

20:20.436 --> 20:22.917
I'm your first call
if you find anything.

20:26.616 --> 20:29.184
[door opens and closes]

20:30.316 --> 20:31.360
What is it?

20:31.404 --> 20:33.362
I'm just replaying
how we found Lia.

20:33.406 --> 20:34.494
Can you pull up

20:34.537 --> 20:36.626
that proof of life photo
they sent Colin?

20:36.670 --> 20:38.324
Yeah.

20:41.022 --> 20:43.938
MAGNUM:
Okay, do you notice anything
different about the background?

20:43.981 --> 20:45.722
It doesn't match

20:45.766 --> 20:48.464
any of the walls from the house
where we found her body.

20:49.335 --> 20:51.424
Must've been taken elsewhere.Yeah, I know

20:51.467 --> 20:53.164
you said it would take a while
to hack into the photograph,

20:53.208 --> 20:55.166
but if we can identify
where that was taken,

20:55.210 --> 20:56.429
we might be able to figure out

20:56.472 --> 20:58.300
who the kidnapper was.I'm on it.

20:58.344 --> 21:00.128
MAGNUM:
Okay. In the meantime,

21:00.171 --> 21:02.130
I'm gonna go check
in with Noelani.

21:02.173 --> 21:03.784
Maybe there's some kind of clue

21:03.827 --> 21:05.873
that's been left
on her body.Okay.

21:05.916 --> 21:07.875
All right.

21:19.016 --> 21:21.628
Oh, aloha, Kumu.Hey, aloha.

21:21.671 --> 21:22.977
You waiting
for someone special?

21:23.020 --> 21:25.371
You know, my uncle is single
if you're looking.

21:25.414 --> 21:28.025
I'm flattered, but I'm good.Change your mind,

21:28.069 --> 21:29.984
you can check out his profile
on OK Venus.

21:30.027 --> 21:32.639
But ignore his age.
He's ten years older.

21:32.682 --> 21:33.857
And heavier.

21:33.901 --> 21:35.381
And bald.

21:35.424 --> 21:38.297
Kind of looks like a Hawaiian
version of the Kool-Aid Man.

21:38.340 --> 21:39.820
Ooh, that sounds like
a real catch.

21:39.863 --> 21:42.779
[chuckles] I'm scared how
you pitch me to other people.

21:42.823 --> 21:46.130
You're kind of like
a Hawaiian Martha Stewart.

21:46.174 --> 21:47.784
Well, I'll take it.
[chuckles]

21:47.828 --> 21:50.396
[chuckles]Oh, scuse me, Flippa.

21:50.439 --> 21:52.093
Oh, shoots.

21:52.136 --> 21:54.835
Hey.Hey, Maleah.

21:54.878 --> 21:56.184
Thanks for coming out here.Yeah.

21:56.227 --> 21:57.359
Are you hungry?

21:57.403 --> 21:59.187
They have a mean
garlic shrimp plate.

21:59.230 --> 22:02.973
No, I'm still stuffed
from last night. [chuckles]Oh.

22:03.017 --> 22:04.714
So,

22:04.758 --> 22:06.760
how's Kelvin doing?

22:06.803 --> 22:08.370
Oh, he's great.Good.

22:08.414 --> 22:11.155
Good. What does he
do for work again?

22:11.199 --> 22:12.896
Uh, he's kind of
in between jobs right now.

22:12.940 --> 22:15.638
Oh, really? For how long?

22:15.682 --> 22:17.379
Mm, like, three months.

22:17.423 --> 22:18.598
Wow.

22:18.641 --> 22:20.164
So,

22:20.208 --> 22:21.514
how's he supporting himself?

22:21.557 --> 22:23.385
Well, he's staying
with me right now.

22:23.429 --> 22:25.039
I see.

22:26.562 --> 22:29.957
[chuckles]: Uh, are you
trying to say something here?

22:30.000 --> 22:31.611
Uh, what do you mean?

22:31.654 --> 22:34.178
Well, it might not look like it,
but I have thick skin,

22:34.222 --> 22:36.877
so you can be straight with me.

22:36.920 --> 22:38.922
Good to know.

22:40.228 --> 22:42.317
I guess I-I just have
some reservations

22:42.361 --> 22:43.927
about Kelvin.
[chuckles]

22:45.015 --> 22:47.235
But you don't even know him.

22:47.278 --> 22:49.368
I know. It's just his tone.

22:49.411 --> 22:51.239
I feel like he's covering.

22:51.282 --> 22:53.720
It's, uh, it's almost like

22:53.763 --> 22:55.330
a mother's intuition.

22:55.374 --> 22:57.419
But you're not my mother.

22:57.463 --> 23:00.640
I-I didn't mean to imply that...Look, just because

23:00.683 --> 23:02.032
my dad was unfaithful to you

23:02.076 --> 23:04.252
doesn't mean
that every guy is like that.

23:05.035 --> 23:06.254
I know.

23:06.297 --> 23:08.430
But I think we're friends,

23:08.474 --> 23:11.085
and as friends, I have the right
to share my opinion.

23:11.128 --> 23:13.130
I think you have
the wrong idea here.

23:13.174 --> 23:16.569
I know I haven't spent
much time with him, but...I'm not talking

23:16.612 --> 23:19.398
about Kelvin.
I-I'm talking about us.

23:20.529 --> 23:22.357
We don't have
the type of relationship

23:22.401 --> 23:24.054
that you think that we do.

23:33.150 --> 23:34.456
They just brought her in
a couple minutes ago.

23:34.500 --> 23:36.197
Katsumoto said you
might be stopping by.

23:36.240 --> 23:37.981
You know,
I know there's protocol,

23:38.025 --> 23:40.462
but I can make it
worth your while.

23:40.506 --> 23:41.811
Chopper tour,

23:41.855 --> 23:43.117
dinner at La Mariana.

23:43.160 --> 23:44.945
You know,
I even have a turquoise Vespa

23:44.988 --> 23:46.250
you could take for the weekend.

23:46.294 --> 23:47.948
Take your pick.You know,

23:47.991 --> 23:49.297
your bribes are getting old.

23:49.340 --> 23:50.516
And how dare you offer up

23:50.559 --> 23:53.475
Kumu's scooter?
No to all of that.

23:54.171 --> 23:56.435
[sighs] But I will
help you out as a friend.

23:56.478 --> 23:59.307
Look, Katsumoto
gave me a heads-up,

23:59.350 --> 24:00.308
but it wasn't to stop you.

24:00.351 --> 24:01.614
None of this is your fault,

24:01.657 --> 24:04.268
and you need to get
whoever killed this woman.

24:05.008 --> 24:07.141
Appreciate it. Thanks, Doc.

24:07.184 --> 24:08.969
Well, obviously,

24:09.012 --> 24:12.059
C.O.D. was a gunshot
to the forehead.

24:12.102 --> 24:13.321
MAGNUM:
Huh.

24:13.364 --> 24:14.583
CUNHA:
What? What do you see?Well,

24:14.627 --> 24:16.716
it's what I don't
see. Her roots.

24:16.759 --> 24:18.805
Why would you expect
to see her roots?

24:18.848 --> 24:20.807
Well, Lia made an appointment
with her hair colorist

24:20.850 --> 24:23.679
this morning,
but I don't see any roots.

24:25.855 --> 24:27.335
CUNHA:
Interesting.

24:27.378 --> 24:29.772
Right? I mean, why would she
set it up if she didn't need

24:29.816 --> 24:30.947
a dye job?No.

24:30.991 --> 24:32.427
I just noticed something else.

24:32.471 --> 24:34.342
What is it?It's a bluebottle fly egg.

24:34.385 --> 24:36.431
Pretty common here in Hawaii.

24:36.475 --> 24:37.737
Do you know what this means?

24:37.780 --> 24:39.260
Yeah. Yeah.

24:39.303 --> 24:40.653
But-but why don't you tell me

24:40.696 --> 24:43.133
so I know
that you know what it means.

24:43.917 --> 24:45.396
Well, Mrs. Braggs' body

24:45.440 --> 24:47.660
was found in a house
with no AC or open windows.

24:47.703 --> 24:50.532
Now, the temperature inside
obfuscated the time of death,

24:50.576 --> 24:51.794
but the maturity

24:51.838 --> 24:53.187
of this egg indicates

24:53.230 --> 24:55.319
she's been dead
for more than eight hours.

24:55.363 --> 24:57.757
More than eight hours?Yeah.

24:57.800 --> 25:01.064
Well, that means Lia was dead
before the first ransom call.

25:10.291 --> 25:11.640
MAGNUM:
If Lia was dead before

25:11.684 --> 25:13.294
the call came in, that
means the kidnapper

25:13.337 --> 25:15.339
took the picture before
Colin asked for it.

25:15.383 --> 25:16.776
Which means
he never had any intention

25:16.819 --> 25:18.038
of returning her alive.

25:18.081 --> 25:19.866
We need the metadata
from that photo.

25:19.909 --> 25:21.041
I'm working on it.

25:21.084 --> 25:22.608
Good, 'cause CSU got nothing

25:22.651 --> 25:24.261
from the kidnapper's car.MAGNUM:
Hey, hey, Gordie,

25:24.305 --> 25:25.915
by the way,
thanks for giving Noelani

25:25.959 --> 25:27.134
the green light to help us out.

25:27.177 --> 25:28.483
We really appreciate it.

25:28.527 --> 25:29.571
I don't know
what you're talking about.

25:29.615 --> 25:30.790
That'd be against protocol.

25:30.833 --> 25:32.705
Keep me in the loop.

25:32.748 --> 25:34.489
Will do.

25:37.884 --> 25:40.103
KUMU:
Hey.

25:41.278 --> 25:44.238
I heard what happened
with Mr. Braggs' wife.

25:44.281 --> 25:45.500
You okay?

25:45.544 --> 25:48.503
Yeah. Yeah,
I'm hanging in there.

25:48.547 --> 25:51.724
Had to come back
and hold down the fort.

25:51.767 --> 25:54.727
What, you come all the way
down here to check up on me?

25:54.770 --> 25:56.729
That and, um...

25:56.772 --> 25:58.600
I needed some advice.

25:58.644 --> 26:00.080
What's up?

26:00.123 --> 26:02.778
Well, last night,
we had a dinner party.Yes, I know.

26:02.822 --> 26:06.390
At Robin's Nest. And TC and I
weren't invited. Go on.

26:07.435 --> 26:09.742
Maleah brought her boyfriend,

26:09.785 --> 26:12.875
and I just got
a bad vibe off him.

26:12.919 --> 26:14.007
How do you mean?

26:14.050 --> 26:16.270
I mean I don't trust him.

26:16.313 --> 26:20.143
Well, whatever you do,
don't tell her that.

26:20.970 --> 26:22.711
You already told her that.

26:22.755 --> 26:24.452
And I'm guessing

26:24.495 --> 26:26.410
she wasn't having it.No.

26:26.454 --> 26:29.457
Look, I know I'm not her mother,

26:29.500 --> 26:32.939
but I feel this need
to watch over her.

26:32.982 --> 26:35.768
And I know
Icepick wasn't your father,

26:35.811 --> 26:37.465
but he was there for you.

26:37.508 --> 26:39.119
He kept you on
the right path.

26:39.162 --> 26:40.555
How'd he do that?

26:40.599 --> 26:42.644
How'd he get you to listen?

26:43.689 --> 26:45.560
Fear, mostly.

26:45.604 --> 26:48.737
I knew I'd catch holy hell
if I did something stupid.

26:48.781 --> 26:52.567
I'm not sure that's gonna work
for you and Maleah, though.

26:52.611 --> 26:54.743
You know, I-I think the thing is

26:54.787 --> 26:57.137
you got to let her
make her own mistakes.

26:57.180 --> 26:58.486
I know that's hard,

26:58.529 --> 27:00.619
but that's the only way
she's gonna grow.

27:00.662 --> 27:03.839
Maybe this guy
is gonna burn her,

27:03.883 --> 27:06.233
but she'll survive.

27:06.276 --> 27:08.017
Especially if she knows
she's got you

27:08.061 --> 27:09.628
to help her through it.

27:13.544 --> 27:15.329
[computer chimes]Okay, I'm in.

27:18.854 --> 27:20.160
The proof of life photo

27:20.203 --> 27:22.249
is actually a composite
of two different images.

27:22.292 --> 27:23.990
The photo of Lia
was taken months ago

27:24.033 --> 27:26.340
whereas the picture of today's
newspaper was just photoshopped

27:26.383 --> 27:28.037
on top.Is there any way to tell

27:28.081 --> 27:29.343
who took them?No.

27:29.386 --> 27:30.561
But the older one is geotagged,

27:30.605 --> 27:32.215
so that could tell us something.

27:32.955 --> 27:34.522
It's a rental property

27:34.565 --> 27:36.393
owned by a management company,
Churran Inc.

27:36.437 --> 27:39.527
I'll inform Katsumoto.Yeah, but even if
Katsumoto gets a warrant,

27:39.570 --> 27:41.529
it's gonna be hours
before anything happens.

27:41.572 --> 27:42.878
I-I say we go there.

27:42.922 --> 27:44.140
If we find something,
we'll let him know.

27:44.184 --> 27:46.229
Oh, he'll love that.Hey.

27:46.273 --> 27:48.884
We get a lead, he'll forgive us.

27:50.407 --> 27:52.627
[alarm blaring]

27:54.673 --> 27:57.719
Great. We got 18 seconds.

28:02.768 --> 28:03.812
Still on.

28:03.856 --> 28:05.901
But now we can't use
the microwave.

28:11.864 --> 28:13.692
[alarm stops]

28:16.346 --> 28:18.566
That's one way to do it.

28:25.094 --> 28:28.750
There's a bunch of bills here
addressed to Frank Braggs.

28:29.577 --> 28:31.187
That's the same surname
as Colin.

28:31.231 --> 28:34.756
Most of them are past due, too.
This guy's underwater.

28:36.453 --> 28:39.021
[keyboard clacking]

28:40.066 --> 28:41.937
Frank Braggs is Colin's brother.

28:41.981 --> 28:45.419
So, either Frank had something
to do with Lia's abduction

28:45.462 --> 28:47.769
or they got that photo
off his cloud.

28:47.813 --> 28:49.771
What else
do you have on him?

28:49.815 --> 28:52.774
Well, he certainly doesn't share
his brother's business acumen.

28:52.818 --> 28:55.690
Several failed
financial ventures.

28:55.734 --> 28:57.997
He currently drives an Uber
to make ends meet.

28:58.040 --> 28:59.476
It actually looks like Colin

28:59.520 --> 29:01.827
was helping Frank out
financially quite a bit.

29:01.870 --> 29:03.611
Although the payments
stopped abruptly

29:03.654 --> 29:07.136
earlier this year, which is when
Frank's financial issues

29:07.180 --> 29:08.703
really started piling up.

29:08.747 --> 29:10.226
Maybe Frank was trying
to get back at his brother

29:10.270 --> 29:12.098
for cutting him off.
I mean, money has a funny way

29:12.141 --> 29:15.144
of turning things ugly,
even between family members.

29:15.188 --> 29:16.667
<i>Especially</i>between family.

29:16.711 --> 29:18.800
But if Colin and Frank
had fallen out,

29:18.844 --> 29:22.282
is it strange that Lia
was here in Frank's apartment?

29:22.325 --> 29:24.023
