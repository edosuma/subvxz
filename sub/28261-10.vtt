Previously on "Pretty Little
Liars, The Perfectionists.."

00:02.169 --> 00:04.213
I did it to protect you
and your family.

00:04.213 --> 00:06.882
- From Nolan?
- You wanted him gone too, Cait.

00:06.882 --> 00:08.842
(Taylor)
Someone hijacked Beacon Guard
to spy

00:08.842 --> 00:10.719
on a select group of people
at BHU.

00:10.719 --> 00:12.095
I never figured out
who they were.

00:12.095 --> 00:13.972
I promised my dad
I wouldn't tell anyone.

00:13.972 --> 00:15.974
You can't be defined
by one mistake.

00:15.974 --> 00:17.601
(Dylan)
Yeah, unless you cheat at BHU.

00:17.601 --> 00:19.686
I was there
when my dad was shot.

00:19.686 --> 00:22.022
I saw it all
and I still see it every day.

00:22.022 --> 00:24.274
I'm so sorry. A friend of mine
needs help. I'll be right back.

00:24.274 --> 00:26.109
- That's Lee Redmond.
- The Manhattan gallery owner?

00:26.109 --> 00:27.986
Don't waste your shot,

00:27.986 --> 00:31.240

Zach.

00:31.240 --> 00:32.991
A member of my staff is having

00:32.991 --> 00:35.869
an inappropriate relationship
with a student.

00:35.869 --> 00:37.537
- Really?
- You're terminated.

00:37.537 --> 00:39.248
- Dana has your money.
- What?

00:39.248 --> 00:42.000
(Taylor)
Jeremy was walking
toward Thorne Hall

00:42.000 --> 00:43.335
moments before the blackout.

00:43.335 --> 00:44.544
He killed Nolan.

00:44.544 --> 00:45.879
If I tell the police what I did

00:45.879 --> 00:47.923
then my life will be over,
and so will yours.

00:47.923 --> 00:49.216
You're not going anywhere.

00:49.216 --> 00:51.343
I trusted you.

00:51.343 --> 00:53.387
[gunshot]

00:53.387 --> 00:55.013
He was running towards you.

00:55.013 --> 00:57.224
And Taylor was afraid
for her life. We all saw it.

00:59.017 --> 01:00.936
You were afraid.

01:00.936 --> 01:02.312

01:12.114 --> 01:15.033

01:15.033 --> 01:18.370
- It was self-defense.
- Jeremy attacked Taylor.

01:18.370 --> 01:20.622
So she shot him
to protect herself.

01:20.622 --> 01:22.124
Why would he wanna hurt Taylor?

01:22.124 --> 01:25.585
Taylor wouldn't let him escape,
so he came after her.

01:25.585 --> 01:28.046
- Jeremy killed Nolan.
- Why?

01:33.677 --> 01:37.764
Ah, he was my boyfriend
while I was dating Nolan.

01:38.974 --> 01:41.059
Jeremy wanted me
to break it off with him

01:41.059 --> 01:43.061
but I wasn't ready.

01:43.061 --> 01:45.647
Jeremy told me what he did.

01:45.647 --> 01:47.733
He wanted me to go away
with him tonight

01:47.733 --> 01:49.443
'but I-I told my friends
to come here'

01:49.443 --> 01:51.987
so we can just try
to convince him..

01:51.987 --> 01:54.489
...to do the right thing
and turn himself in.

01:54.489 --> 01:56.992
No one expected him
to go after Taylor.

01:56.992 --> 01:59.036

Jeremy was stalkin' Nolan.

01:59.036 --> 02:01.913
Taylor found proof.
It's all here.

02:05.584 --> 02:07.127
Is Taylor okay?

02:07.127 --> 02:09.671
Luckily, a family friend
was at the gala tonight.

02:09.671 --> 02:11.548
Dr. Benson's taking her
to a retreat.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.550
She's in good care.

02:14.718 --> 02:17.095
Taylor told me everything.

02:17.095 --> 02:19.556
I can't thank you all enough
for what you did to protect

02:19.556 --> 02:22.893
my daughter and to expose
the man who murdered my son.

02:24.895 --> 02:27.814
I hope you'll accept my apology
for believing

02:27.814 --> 02:30.567
that you had anything to do
with Nolan's death.

02:32.027 --> 02:37.074
I was blinded by grief
and I, uh, put my trust..

02:37.074 --> 02:38.867
...in the wrong hands.

02:41.745 --> 02:45.540
- We're just glad it's over.

to try to tear us apart..

05:14.606 --> 05:15.982
You tell me.

05:15.982 --> 05:18.318
Maybe we can figure it out
this summer in New York.

05:18.318 --> 05:19.945
No way.

05:19.945 --> 05:21.696
You were holding out on me.
You got the exhibit?

05:21.696 --> 05:24.449
- Yeah.

05:24.449 --> 05:25.909
Yeah, it's huge.

I have a lot of potential.

Just whenever things start to go
the way they're supposed to go

05:37.462 --> 05:40.090

So if I am going to New York
this summer

05:51.476 --> 05:53.895
I'm going to need a job
to pay for it

05:53.895 --> 05:54.938
or two or three like you

05:54.938 --> 05:57.983
so can you put in a good word
for me?

05:57.983 --> 06:00.735
- I thought you had money.
- Not anymore.

06:01.945 --> 06:05.073
But that's okay.
I will work to pay my way.

06:07.617 --> 06:08.910
I don't need to wait
until this summer

06:08.910 --> 06:11.705
to figure out what we are.

06:11.705 --> 06:14.749
- I know what I want.

in Seattle.

not getting that internship.

Thank you for taking a chance
on me and for loving me.

I'm the luckiest guy at BHU.

that Claire gives everybody

07:14.184 --> 07:16.102
a second chance,
but you have to leave.

07:16.102 --> 07:19.147
Claire made it clear there are
some things she can't forgive.

07:19.147 --> 07:21.608
Sleeping with a student
is one of them.

07:21.608 --> 07:23.693
There was no talking her
out of this.

07:23.693 --> 07:25.987

I loved this job.

07:25.987 --> 07:27.238

07:27.238 --> 07:29.074
I'll never find out
what that list was.

of the system, remember?

07:32.035 --> 07:34.454
You, Ray Hogadorn and Caitlin.

07:34.454 --> 07:35.830
Someone was using
my admissions code

07:35.830 --> 07:37.707
to generate a list
of some sort.

07:37.707 --> 07:39.876

Some puzzles are just
not meant to be solved.

07:42.003 --> 07:43.505
Do you know
what that sounds like to me?

07:43.505 --> 07:47.092
It's like telling a kid
they can never have candy again.

07:47.092 --> 07:49.844
Maybe getting out of here
isn't such a bad thing.

07:49.844 --> 07:52.389
Let's face it.
This town breeds drama.

07:52.389 --> 07:54.724
Think about Taylor and
everything she's been through.

was for the right reasons, but..
