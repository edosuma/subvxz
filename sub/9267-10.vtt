WEBVTT

00:01.568 --> 00:02.668
Yeah, on good behavior.

00:02.702 --> 00:04.670
Y'all remember Becky, right?

00:05.939 --> 00:08.039
- Well, don't leave then.
- I'm leaving.

00:08.074 --> 00:09.975
Because, you know what,
we're done, jackass.

00:10.010 --> 00:13.145
You recognize that photo?

00:13.179 --> 00:14.880
You're benched for Friday night.

00:14.915 --> 00:16.682
Hey, you're putting Luke at QB?

00:16.716 --> 00:18.317
This is coach Taylor.
Who's this?

00:18.351 --> 00:20.219
John Araldi.
Shane State down in Florida.

00:20.253 --> 00:21.253
Yeah?

00:21.288 --> 00:22.621
Jason Street gave me
your number.

00:22.656 --> 00:24.356
I'm looking for a head coach,

00:24.391 --> 00:26.492
and your name is
at the top of our list.

00:26.526 --> 00:28.861
Will you at least come down
and pay us a visit?

00:31.197 --> 00:34.233
We made the decision to move up
to division one last winter,

00:34.267 --> 00:36.035
and the guy we're looking for

00:36.069 --> 00:37.503
is going to get
the keys to the kingdom...

00:37.537 --> 00:39.672
Complete control
over every aspect

00:39.706 --> 00:41.473
of the football program

00:41.508 --> 00:43.842
from recruiting, scheduling,
personnel, the whole deal.

00:43.877 --> 00:46.278
I mean, you've got
an amazing story.

00:46.313 --> 00:48.180
The way you brought
your team back this year,

00:48.214 --> 00:50.149
I mean, that's very impressive.

00:50.183 --> 00:52.985
You're exactly what we're
looking for in a head coach.

00:53.019 --> 00:56.622
♪ ♪

00:56.656 --> 00:58.390
This is what we can offer.

01:06.166 --> 01:07.433
This is bad.

01:09.102 --> 01:11.704
Mr. Garrity, I don't have
time for all this.

01:11.738 --> 01:15.708
Buddy, please.
It's "Buddy," Levi.

01:15.742 --> 01:18.277
And I need to tell you something
in all seriousness.

01:18.311 --> 01:20.613
That right there marks the end

01:20.647 --> 01:22.715
of the East Dillon Lions
football program

01:22.749 --> 01:24.450
led by coach Eric Taylor.

01:24.484 --> 01:26.518
- It's a crate of oranges.
- Yeah.

01:26.553 --> 01:29.421
And it's from
the Sunshine State,

01:29.456 --> 01:31.090
from Florida.

01:31.124 --> 01:34.493
And that can only mean
one thing...

01:34.527 --> 01:39.598
year-round sunshine
and college funding.

01:39.633 --> 01:41.133
Let me tell you something, Levi.

01:41.167 --> 01:45.571
We are up against it here.
We have a fight on our hands.

01:45.605 --> 01:48.774
A fight to keep
coach Eric Taylor.

01:48.808 --> 01:51.477
You got all that
from a crate of oranges?

01:52.812 --> 01:55.381
Now, your brother's sentence
was for 24 months

01:55.415 --> 01:58.150
with parole eligibility
after 10 months served.

01:58.184 --> 01:59.485
Now, we might be able to get

01:59.519 --> 02:01.020
a sit-down
in front of the parole board,

02:01.054 --> 02:02.655
but what we need
are character witnesses,

02:02.689 --> 02:04.657
people from the community
who can speak on his behalf.

02:04.691 --> 02:06.458
So, Timmy could be coming home?

02:06.493 --> 02:08.494
Well, his release
isn't guaranteed.

02:08.527 --> 02:10.963
I'll be honest,
it's going to be tough.

02:10.997 --> 02:12.498
He's had good behavior
the whole time he's been in.

02:12.532 --> 02:13.766
That's... that's helpful.

02:13.800 --> 02:16.635
Let me give you this.
All right, let's see.

02:16.670 --> 02:18.137
This is a parole packet.

02:18.171 --> 02:20.539
Use it to study. Bring it
with you to the meeting.

02:20.573 --> 02:23.275
So I just get up there
and give a speech?

02:23.309 --> 02:25.444
- Sure.
- Okay.

02:25.478 --> 02:27.312
I can do that, yeah.

02:27.347 --> 02:30.249
But get a few other
character witnesses as well.

02:30.283 --> 02:31.917
Is there anyone
you can think of,

02:31.951 --> 02:34.486
anyone other than yourself
that would be good for this,

02:34.521 --> 02:37.389
someone who can stand up
and... and speak for Tim?

02:37.424 --> 02:40.959
Uh...Yeah, I'll figure it out.

02:40.994 --> 02:42.561
- Do. It's important.
- Okay.

02:42.595 --> 02:45.230
- We'll need them.
- Okay.

02:45.265 --> 02:46.899
- Come on, son.
- Keep throwing up them bricks.

02:46.933 --> 02:48.233
- What?
- We're going to build a house.

02:48.268 --> 02:49.535
Hey, hey.
Respect your elders, boy.

02:49.569 --> 02:51.236
Grown folks court right here.

02:51.271 --> 02:53.005
You ain't know no better.

02:55.775 --> 02:58.277
Why you grabbing me, huh?
Why you grabbing me?

02:58.311 --> 03:00.012
Why you grabbing me?

03:00.046 --> 03:02.715
Look at that.
Bounce in the house! Whoo!

03:02.749 --> 03:04.316
This your lucky court,
that's why.

03:04.350 --> 03:06.652
- You got a high. Yeah.
- All right, all right.

03:06.686 --> 03:08.387
Wait, hold on, hold on.

03:08.421 --> 03:09.688
Don't shoot none.

03:09.723 --> 03:11.890
Whatever. Always cheating.

03:11.925 --> 03:13.992
Home rules, baby.
Home rules.

03:14.027 --> 03:16.228
- Whatever.
- Oh, oh, oh, this is it.

03:16.262 --> 03:19.331
- What?
- Oklahoma Tech.

03:19.365 --> 03:23.635
Hello? Ah, Mr. Kirk.

03:23.670 --> 03:25.904
Yeah, yeah, how you doing, man?

03:25.939 --> 03:28.807
You got some good news for me?

03:30.376 --> 03:33.912
Hold on.
You're joking, right?

03:33.947 --> 03:36.248
You're kidding me, man!

03:36.282 --> 03:38.650
What the hell was
the visit for, then?!

03:38.685 --> 03:42.121
Hey, tell them they're making
a big mistake, you hear?!

03:44.324 --> 03:45.791
What happened, pop?

03:47.694 --> 03:49.228
They offered it
to the Toby kid.

03:49.262 --> 03:51.497
- The lefty?
- Yes!

03:53.500 --> 03:55.033
I thought you said
we had it in the bag, pop?

03:55.068 --> 03:56.902
I know what I said, boy!

03:59.072 --> 04:00.739
Damn!

04:00.774 --> 04:04.743
No, forget it.
Grab the stuff, boy.

04:04.778 --> 04:06.245
Ah!

04:55.457 --> 04:56.891
Well, East Dillon is gearing up

04:56.925 --> 04:59.794
for its first playoff run
after a Cinderella season.

05:00.670 --> 05:02.571
But there is a rumor afloat.

05:02.606 --> 05:04.673
Some people are saying that
coach Taylor is in the running

05:04.708 --> 05:06.208
for a college coaching position.

05:06.243 --> 05:07.743
Did you see that, little girl?

05:07.777 --> 05:10.347
Could the East Dillon Lions
lose their kingmaker?

05:10.963 --> 05:12.931
No doubt the Lions'
powerhouse season

05:12.965 --> 05:14.766
has upped coach Taylor's stock,

05:14.801 --> 05:18.603
but will this translate into
his leaving his team behind?

05:20.372 --> 05:22.940
- Gracie Belle.
- Hey, honey.

05:22.974 --> 05:24.676
How you doing, monkey?

05:25.710 --> 05:27.712
- Monkey doodle.
- Grace, your daddy's home.

05:28.340 --> 05:30.342
So, how was it, honey?
Are we moving to Florida?

05:31.077 --> 05:33.278
Ah, it was very interesting.

05:33.413 --> 05:36.515
Oh, good. And who did you
talk to? How was the facility?

05:36.549 --> 05:38.550
I talked to just about
everybody that's down there

05:38.585 --> 05:40.319
- that's involved in the program.
- Oh, that's good.

05:40.353 --> 05:42.187
They must have really rolled out
the red carpet for you, then.

05:42.222 --> 05:43.655
I don't know if they've got
a red carpet

05:43.690 --> 05:44.656
down there to roll out.

05:44.691 --> 05:45.757
It was nice, though.

05:45.792 --> 05:47.793
But I think, overall,

05:47.827 --> 05:51.096
it looked like a pretty solid
opportunity, I suppose.

05:51.130 --> 05:52.231
Good.

05:52.265 --> 05:53.799
Vince, you ain't gonna believe

05:53.833 --> 05:55.334
how many people are coming into
the garden shop

05:55.368 --> 05:57.469
asking for bulbs, you know?

05:57.504 --> 05:59.338
I thought y'all sold flowers.

05:59.372 --> 06:00.639
Boy, that <i>is</i> a flower.

06:00.673 --> 06:02.407
Okay, okay. Now I've got
it all figured out.

06:02.442 --> 06:04.276
What do you have figured out?

06:04.310 --> 06:06.011
We're going to call TMU,

06:06.045 --> 06:08.981
because coach Fletcher,
he was all over you.

06:09.015 --> 06:11.116
So I'm going to talk to him,
generate a little heat

06:11.150 --> 06:12.885
and play them against
Mississippi Central...

06:12.919 --> 06:14.419
- Hey, dad! Dad!
- And the next thing you know...

06:14.454 --> 06:16.221
Dad, no. Maybe we should
just talk to coach.

06:18.992 --> 06:21.159
No, I...

06:21.194 --> 06:22.661
I'm just saying I need
to be focused

06:22.695 --> 06:24.630
on this game Friday night.

06:24.664 --> 06:26.265
Worried about getting
my spot back, right?

06:26.299 --> 06:28.400
You going to get that back.

06:28.434 --> 06:30.502
You're a Howard.
You're a star.

06:30.537 --> 06:33.772
- Thanks, pop, but...
- Mm-hmm.

06:33.806 --> 06:35.774
I think we need to
take a step back

06:35.808 --> 06:38.810
on all the meetings,
just for a while.

06:38.845 --> 06:42.514
Just...Just be cool.

06:45.385 --> 06:46.885
You're the boss.

06:46.920 --> 06:49.621
All right, all right.

06:49.656 --> 06:51.423
I got to go to school.
I'm going to be late.

06:51.457 --> 06:52.925
Yeah, don't be late.

06:52.959 --> 06:55.427
Have a good day, baby.

06:57.363 --> 06:59.164
- Madame chairman?
- Yeah?

06:59.198 --> 07:02.167
Can you give us updates
on the homework club, please?

07:02.201 --> 07:06.271
Yes, y'all. It really is
starting to work,

07:06.306 --> 07:07.639
I have to tell you.

07:07.674 --> 07:09.875
Expelling Epyck,
that was a good start.

07:09.909 --> 07:11.643
All right, regardless of that,

07:11.678 --> 07:13.845
the homework club
is making a difference.

07:13.880 --> 07:16.982
And we can impact
10 more students

07:17.016 --> 07:19.384
if we get one more volunteer.

07:19.419 --> 07:20.786
- Do we get a flak jacket?
- One more.

07:20.820 --> 07:23.555
'Cause I don't want to
end up with a concussion.

07:23.590 --> 07:25.557
- All right, all right.
- It's not what I'm here for.

07:25.592 --> 07:27.192
- Anyway, um...
- All right, let's move on.

07:27.226 --> 07:28.226
One more volunteer
would be great.

07:28.261 --> 07:30.228
Yes, let's just move on.

07:30.263 --> 07:32.664
Our last item is this fall's
athletics banquet this week.

07:32.699 --> 07:35.968
It's not mandatory to attend,

07:36.002 --> 07:39.004
but it does show good support
from our faculty

07:39.038 --> 07:40.205
if you're there.

07:40.239 --> 07:42.574
And also, you get a free dinner,
okay?

07:42.609 --> 07:46.011
- Whoo! Free dinner.
- All right! That's it!

07:46.045 --> 07:48.180
- Have a good day, East Dillon!
- All right.

07:48.214 --> 07:49.848
See, I got this idea, Levi.

07:49.882 --> 07:52.951
What we do is,
we turn the athletic banquet

07:52.986 --> 07:55.988
into a tribute for...
For coach Taylor.

07:56.022 --> 07:58.757
Well, the banquet's
for all the teams,

07:58.791 --> 07:59.958
not just football.

07:59.993 --> 08:01.159
Well, I understand that,

08:01.194 --> 08:03.428
but this would give
each individual Lion

08:03.463 --> 08:04.963
a chance to stand up

08:04.998 --> 08:07.899
and give a little impromptu
speech about the coach.

08:07.934 --> 08:10.636
Well, impromptu means
unplanned, Buddy.

08:10.670 --> 08:13.171
Well, then promptu.

08:13.206 --> 08:16.274
What I'm trying to say, Levi,
is we have to make a case

08:16.309 --> 08:20.412
to try to keep coach Taylor here
instead of off chasing oranges.

08:20.446 --> 08:22.347
How do y'all feel
about coach leaving?

08:22.382 --> 08:24.216
That's just a stupid rumor,
Tink.

08:24.250 --> 08:25.817
How do you know?

08:25.852 --> 08:28.153
I just know.
He's not going anywhere.

08:35.428 --> 08:37.529
Oklahoma Tech didn't offer.

08:37.563 --> 08:39.398
At least he had an offer.

08:39.432 --> 08:41.232
Not anymore.

08:45.204 --> 08:46.238
Stretch 'em out!

08:46.272 --> 08:48.073
All right, let's hang 'em.

08:48.107 --> 08:52.944
1, 2, 3, 4, 5...

08:52.979 --> 08:54.980
A man can't leave
if you erect a statue of him

08:55.014 --> 08:56.014
in his honor.

08:56.049 --> 08:57.683
Think about it.

08:57.717 --> 08:59.317
- Coach Taylor?
- Mmm.

09:00.486 --> 09:01.887
How about a plaque?

09:01.921 --> 09:03.588
- 1, 2...
- You got money for that?

09:03.623 --> 09:05.791
I could work on money
for a plaque.

09:05.825 --> 09:08.460
Okay.
A plaque sounds good.

09:09.629 --> 09:11.563
I submitted you for this.

09:11.597 --> 09:13.965
You submitted me for
something without telling me?

09:14.000 --> 09:15.100
Yeah, I'm the principal.

09:15.134 --> 09:16.234
I can do a lot of things
without telling you.

09:16.269 --> 09:17.736
What is this?

09:17.770 --> 09:20.806
Uh, it's a conference
in Lubbock day after tomorrow.

09:20.840 --> 09:24.443
You'll be on a panel
about getting kids into college,

09:24.477 --> 09:26.611
and I think you're
more than qualified for it.

09:26.646 --> 09:28.747
And they think so too.

09:28.781 --> 09:31.483
And, Tami, I think it would be
good for you

09:31.517 --> 09:33.819
as well as East Dillon, okay?

09:33.853 --> 09:35.587
- Thank you.
- Good.

09:35.621 --> 09:38.223
- Um, hey, one more quick thing.
- Yeah.

09:38.257 --> 09:39.591
Do we know anything
about Epyck?

09:39.625 --> 09:42.894
Has she showed up at Kilroy
or...?

09:42.929 --> 09:46.031
Mm, no. Her papers
haven't come in yet.

09:46.065 --> 09:49.568
Plus, we have 500 other students
to be concerned about, Tami.

09:49.602 --> 09:51.636
Okay?

09:51.671 --> 09:53.972
- Okay.
- All right.

09:54.006 --> 09:56.341
And you can take it
as a personal day, okay?

09:56.375 --> 09:59.144
- Personal day?
- Yeah.

09:59.178 --> 10:01.980
- Oh, Levi, you are too much.
- Yes, ma'am.

10:02.014 --> 10:03.782
- You are too much.
- Have a good y!

10:03.816 --> 10:05.083
You too!

10:05.118 --> 10:07.119
Yeah, I know
that you're enjoying

10:07.153 --> 10:09.788
those really fresh, nice
Florida oranges.

10:09.822 --> 10:11.089
I saw the crate in there.

10:11.124 --> 10:13.058
Why don't you just come out
and tell me

10:13.092 --> 10:14.593
that you got an offer...

10:14.627 --> 10:18.764
Don't do that.
Don't do that.

10:18.798 --> 10:20.465
How's Buddy, Jr. doing?

10:20.500 --> 10:23.368
The surgery went fine.

10:23.402 --> 10:25.937
He's at home with his laptop
and TV.

10:25.972 --> 10:27.806
How much longer in the cast?

10:27.840 --> 10:30.575
6 to 8 weeks.

10:30.610 --> 10:32.911
I'm sorry about that.

10:32.945 --> 10:34.613
I am too, Eric.

10:34.647 --> 10:37.249
I'm especially sorry that
he may never get to play for you

10:37.283 --> 10:41.153
since you're going to go off
to greener pastures right now.

10:41.187 --> 10:42.587
- Coach?
- Yeah?

10:42.622 --> 10:44.356
- You got a minute?
- Yeah.

10:44.390 --> 10:46.057
Hey, Buddy, how are you?

10:46.092 --> 10:48.593
Oh, hey, Billy.

10:48.628 --> 10:51.163
Do you mind if I have
a minute with coach?

10:51.197 --> 10:53.799
No, no. Go right ahead.

10:53.833 --> 10:56.301
Okay. Um...

10:56.335 --> 11:01.006
Tim's got a parole hearing, um,
this week,

11:01.040 --> 11:02.974
and his lawyer wanted me
to find some people

11:03.009 --> 11:05.010
who'd be willing to speak
on his behalf.

11:05.044 --> 11:08.246
They say it's probably his best
shot of getting out early.

11:08.281 --> 11:09.481
How's he doing?

11:09.515 --> 11:11.683
Yeah, he's doing good.

11:11.717 --> 11:12.951
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

11:12.985 --> 11:14.586
I mean, he's keeping
his head down,

11:14.620 --> 11:16.288
staying out of trouble, so...

11:16.322 --> 11:19.391
I'll be a character witness.

11:19.425 --> 11:21.159
You will?

11:21.194 --> 11:23.061
Your brother Tim Riggins?

11:23.095 --> 11:24.863
Maybe one of the best fullbacks

11:24.897 --> 11:26.665
ever to play in the state
of Texas,

11:26.699 --> 11:28.500
the boy my girl
fell in love with?

11:28.534 --> 11:30.335
Yeah, I'll do that.

11:30.369 --> 11:32.204
I believe in loyalty, Billy.

11:32.238 --> 11:33.438
Okay.

11:33.472 --> 11:35.574
Yeah, I believe in sticking
with your people

11:35.608 --> 11:38.710
through thick and thin,
good and bad.

11:38.744 --> 11:40.378
You know I'll be there.

11:40.413 --> 11:41.880
Okay, thank you, sir.

11:41.914 --> 11:43.815
- You betcha.
- Me too.

11:43.850 --> 11:48.186
All right, thank you.
Thank you.

11:51.691 --> 11:53.124
Hey, Jesse, you wouldn't
hold back on us, right?

11:53.159 --> 11:54.492
You telling us the truth?

11:54.527 --> 11:56.728
I'm telling the truth.
I haven't heard anything.

11:56.762 --> 11:58.730
I haven't heard him say
anything about it

11:58.764 --> 11:59.898
because I'm not snooping.

11:59.932 --> 12:01.700
- I'm going to ask him now.
- No!

12:01.734 --> 12:03.168
Hey, coach!
You going to Florida?

12:03.202 --> 12:05.203
- Oh, damn, Tinker.
- Tinker...

12:05.238 --> 12:06.338
What?

12:06.372 --> 12:09.541
No, I was planning on
going home, Tinker.

12:09.575 --> 12:10.709
So should you.

12:10.743 --> 12:12.544
No, seriously.
Are you leaving, coach?

12:12.578 --> 12:13.778
Come on,
it's all over the news.

12:13.813 --> 12:16.147
We heard in the newspaper
you were leaving.

12:16.182 --> 12:17.749
We heard it on the radio,
coach.

12:17.783 --> 12:19.584
Come on, coach,
it's in the newspaper.

12:19.619 --> 12:20.952
You leaving us for Florida,
huh?

12:20.987 --> 12:23.955
You know where I'm going,
fellas?

12:23.990 --> 12:26.358
I'm going to Northfield
on Friday

12:26.392 --> 12:28.193
on the team bus with you,

12:28.227 --> 12:30.228
because we've got the playoffs
coming up.

12:30.263 --> 12:32.430
Where you going
after the playoffs?

12:32.465 --> 12:34.633
Maybe Disneyland, Tinker.
I don't know.

12:34.667 --> 12:36.635
But other than that, I don't
really have any other plans.

12:36.669 --> 12:39.204
- Whoo!
- Y'all have a good one.

12:39.238 --> 12:41.373
You too, coach.

12:41.407 --> 12:45.944
Oh my gosh!
Would you look at this house?

12:45.978 --> 12:47.846
Gracie, look.

12:47.880 --> 12:49.614
Isn't that pretty, honey?

12:49.649 --> 12:51.616
See that?

12:51.651 --> 12:53.351
She's excited about it.

12:53.386 --> 12:55.120
Honey, this is exciting.

12:55.154 --> 12:57.889
I didn't even focus
on stuff like that.

12:57.924 --> 12:59.991
- Look at that pool.
- Mm-hmm.

13:00.026 --> 13:02.727
How many years
is this offer for?

13:02.762 --> 13:05.830
Three years
with a two-year option.

13:05.865 --> 13:08.199
We could do three years
with that pool,

13:08.234 --> 13:09.868
couldn't we, Gracie Belle?

13:09.902 --> 13:11.703
Yes, we could.

13:11.737 --> 13:14.372
Says it's near
a charter school, too.

13:14.407 --> 13:17.342
This looks beautiful.

13:17.376 --> 13:19.377
Oh, my gosh.

13:27.153 --> 13:28.520
- Vince. Hey, Vince.
- What's going on, Mr. Garrity?

13:28.554 --> 13:29.788
- How are you?
- I'm doing all right.

13:29.822 --> 13:31.256
- Good, good.
- How's Buddy Jr. holding up?

13:31.290 --> 13:32.657
Buddy's doing fine.
He's doing well.

13:32.692 --> 13:34.192
Thanks. Thanks for asking.
Appreciate that.

13:34.226 --> 13:36.428
Listen, all the guys are going
to say a little something

13:36.462 --> 13:39.030
at the banquet about the coach,
all the players.

13:39.065 --> 13:41.366
The football players?
We've got to say something?

13:41.400 --> 13:43.535
Yeah, yeah. And I just want
to give you a heads-up

13:43.569 --> 13:44.669
so you can be prepared.

13:44.704 --> 13:46.204
And, you know,
it will just make him feel

13:46.238 --> 13:48.673
a little special, just a way
to honor coach Taylor.

13:48.708 --> 13:51.476
Mr. Garrity, I don't think
coach really cares

13:51.510 --> 13:53.445
what I got to say.

13:53.479 --> 13:55.447
It won't change nothing no-how.

13:55.481 --> 13:57.315
I don't know if I really
agree with you on that, Vince,

13:57.350 --> 13:58.483
'cause, well, it's...

13:58.517 --> 14:00.285
I mean, I know you didn't
start last week,

14:00.319 --> 14:03.621
but you're one of the leaders
of this team.

14:03.656 --> 14:05.190
You're one of the captains
of this team.

14:05.224 --> 14:08.159
In my opinion,
you're the heart of this team,

14:08.194 --> 14:10.362
and I think
it will mean a lot to him.

14:13.699 --> 14:15.200
All right, well, I'll try
to come up with something.

14:15.234 --> 14:17.335
Thank you.
Appreciate it.

14:17.370 --> 14:18.937
For sure.

14:18.971 --> 14:21.439
Have a good week.

14:21.474 --> 14:23.708
- Ready? You got it?
- Yeah, I'm ready. I'm ready.

14:23.743 --> 14:25.844
- All right.
- Come on, hit me.

14:25.878 --> 14:26.945
Here!

14:28.314 --> 14:29.314
Nice!

14:29.348 --> 14:31.783
- Okay, go long.
- All right.

14:31.817 --> 14:33.351
A little longer, little longer.

14:33.386 --> 14:34.953
You're not going to get it
to me if I go any longer.

14:34.987 --> 14:36.388
I have an awesome arm, okay?

14:36.422 --> 14:38.490
Hit me.

14:38.524 --> 14:40.058
Oh, there you go.

14:40.092 --> 14:43.028
See? Don't make me tackle you.

14:47.867 --> 14:49.834
Unfair size advantage.

14:53.205 --> 14:57.342
So you going to do the whole
college football star thing?

14:57.376 --> 14:58.543
Probably not.

14:58.577 --> 15:01.179
How come?

15:01.213 --> 15:03.181
There's just other people
who are better, you know.

15:03.215 --> 15:06.518
End of story.
Nobody wants me.

15:08.421 --> 15:09.521
I want you.

15:14.493 --> 15:16.194
I thought you were being cute!

15:16.228 --> 15:18.663
That was cute.

15:18.697 --> 15:20.432
My brother has made mistakes,

15:20.466 --> 15:22.567
and he's paid
for those mistakes.

15:22.601 --> 15:25.870
He is a good person,
and he is a true American,

15:25.905 --> 15:28.606
and I can promise you that if...

15:28.641 --> 15:32.177
Damn it. He's a good citizen,
you freaking moron.

15:33.712 --> 15:35.413
My brother has made mistakes,

15:35.448 --> 15:38.149
and he has paid
for those mistakes.

15:38.184 --> 15:39.784
He is a good citizen,

15:39.819 --> 15:42.087
and he will do everything he can

15:42.121 --> 15:43.655
to make sure that
none of these things

15:43.689 --> 15:45.590
happen for him in...

15:45.624 --> 15:47.725
- What are you doing?
- Hey.

15:47.760 --> 15:49.961
Don't sneak up on me
like that, please.

15:49.995 --> 15:53.031
Hey, I wasn't.
That sounded real good.

15:53.065 --> 15:57.402
No, it didn't, okay?
It sounds ridiculous.

15:57.436 --> 15:59.037
Hey, no, it doesn't.

15:59.071 --> 16:02.240
I'm supposed to have this
thing memorized by tomorrow,

16:02.274 --> 16:04.075
and I can't even get halfway
through it right now.

16:04.110 --> 16:06.311
- Hey.
- What?

16:06.345 --> 16:09.047
You're a good brother.

16:09.081 --> 16:11.416
Yeah.

16:12.852 --> 16:14.319
Stop. Please.

16:30.102 --> 16:31.636
Hey, coach, can I talk to you
for a second?

16:31.670 --> 16:33.271
Yeah, come on in.

16:35.875 --> 16:37.242
What you got?

16:37.276 --> 16:39.410
Coach, I know
why you benched me.

16:39.445 --> 16:40.979
All right? I get it.

16:41.013 --> 16:43.281
And I hear you loud and clear.

16:43.315 --> 16:45.917
But I want back, all right?

16:45.951 --> 16:47.218
I want to take us
to the playoffs.

16:47.253 --> 16:48.653
I will take us to state.

16:48.687 --> 16:51.923
I understand Oklahoma Tech
went with someone else.

16:55.361 --> 16:56.928
Yeah.

17:00.332 --> 17:01.566
You're going to have to
work your way back.

17:01.600 --> 17:02.567
The team comes first.

17:02.601 --> 17:05.170
We do not play
to get you offers.

17:10.709 --> 17:12.810
I'm going to earn it back.

17:21.387 --> 17:22.686
I'm just trying to be
realistic,

17:22.721 --> 17:24.756
because I'm thinking maybe,
you know,

17:24.790 --> 17:27.458
football's not just going to
hand me my future on a plate.

17:27.492 --> 17:29.627
I hear you.

17:29.662 --> 17:32.897
So I was just thinking
of what's happening next,

17:32.932 --> 17:35.767
like after I graduate
and, you know...

17:35.801 --> 17:37.936
Unless you think that's
too late already.

17:37.970 --> 17:40.672
Oh no. It's absolutely
not too late.

17:40.706 --> 17:43.374
College deadlines
are coming up, though.

17:43.409 --> 17:45.310
Have you started
your applications at all, or...?

17:45.344 --> 17:47.212
Well, no, because
I thought that...

17:47.246 --> 17:48.780
I just figured that with college

17:48.814 --> 17:50.949
everything was going to be
football,

17:50.983 --> 17:53.117
like that was going to
get me to school, so...

17:53.152 --> 17:56.521
Well, I think
it would be useful to talk about

17:56.555 --> 18:00.892
what your other interests are,
I mean, besides football.

18:00.926 --> 18:03.695
What do you think
you're good at?

18:06.098 --> 18:09.367
I haven't really... I need
a chance to think about it.

18:09.401 --> 18:10.802
That's okay.

18:10.836 --> 18:13.004
Think about it.

18:13.038 --> 18:16.007
Okay.

18:16.041 --> 18:19.010
I brought you some water.

18:19.044 --> 18:20.345
Thank you.

18:22.381 --> 18:23.681
How many books
did she make you read?

18:23.716 --> 18:26.417
Five.

18:26.452 --> 18:28.586
She's gotten real good
at picking out words.

18:28.621 --> 18:30.188
Hmm.

18:30.222 --> 18:32.090
I have no idea
what I'm going to say

18:32.124 --> 18:34.926
at this stupid panel tomorrow.

18:36.362 --> 18:38.796
Are you thinking about
Shane State?

18:41.600 --> 18:43.635
Tim Riggins is up for parole.

18:43.669 --> 18:45.937
Billy came into the office today

18:45.971 --> 18:48.039
and asked if I'd be
a character witness

18:48.073 --> 18:50.508
at the hearing tomorrow.

18:50.542 --> 18:52.176
You going to do it?

18:52.211 --> 18:54.512
You bet I'm going to do it.

18:54.546 --> 18:56.948
That poor kid.

19:02.087 --> 19:04.689
But I put hot sauce on it,
and they say "hold on now.

19:04.723 --> 19:06.057
This is Mrs. B's hot sauce."

19:06.091 --> 19:07.258
I said, "come on, now."

19:07.293 --> 19:09.494
I mean, I put it all
up on it, man, you know.

19:09.528 --> 19:10.795
- What's up, pops?
- Hey.

19:10.829 --> 19:12.263
What's going on?
Where's mom at?

19:12.298 --> 19:14.132
She's at the house, man.
Some people I want you to meet.

19:14.166 --> 19:16.768
This is Andy Oswald
and Glen Peppers.

19:16.802 --> 19:18.770
- Mississippi Central.
- Hey, uh...

19:18.804 --> 19:21.139
This is the man here,
the man with the arm, right.

19:21.173 --> 19:23.074
I'm looking forward to
talking with you. Have a seat.

19:23.108 --> 19:26.110
Um, pop, can I... can I talk
to you for a second?

19:26.145 --> 19:29.147
Yeah, yeah. We've just got
some family business.

19:29.181 --> 19:31.482
We'll be right back.
Enjoy the chips, all right?

19:31.517 --> 19:32.517
- All right.
- We'll be talking to you.

19:32.551 --> 19:34.152
- Okay, Mr. Howard.
- All right.

19:35.888 --> 19:37.689
- Pop, what you doing?
- What?

19:37.723 --> 19:39.157
I thought we said we was
going to take a step back.

19:39.191 --> 19:40.458
Yeah, I know...
I know what I said,

19:40.492 --> 19:42.460
but, look here, I found out
that coach Fletcher,

19:42.494 --> 19:43.795
you know, from TMU,

19:43.829 --> 19:45.763
he offered to some kid,
Chris Patterson.

19:45.798 --> 19:48.232
Okay, the clock is ticking now.
We've got to make moves.

19:48.267 --> 19:50.134
Pop, I'm not meeting
with nobody else, all right?

19:50.169 --> 19:51.602
I can't afford to get in
any more trouble with coach.

19:51.637 --> 19:52.637
I told you that.

19:52.671 --> 19:55.573
Look, son...

19:55.607 --> 19:58.142
We've only got so many choices.

19:58.177 --> 20:00.144
So we've got to jump
on opportunities, all right?

20:00.179 --> 20:02.814
Now what you need to do
is lose the attitude

20:02.848 --> 20:04.849
and sit your butt on down now.

20:04.883 --> 20:06.184
Now, I ain't playing.
Come on.

20:06.218 --> 20:08.453
Buck up.

20:11.924 --> 20:14.792
Come on, Vince. Son!

20:14.827 --> 20:17.228
All right, yeah. Go on.
Handle that paper.

20:17.262 --> 20:19.330
Yeah, uh, sorry, sorry.

20:19.365 --> 20:20.765
He ain't going to be able
to make it tonight

20:20.799 --> 20:22.500
because he's got a paper due,
you know.

20:22.534 --> 20:24.569
And schoolwork is
very important to him.

20:24.603 --> 20:25.937
- Absolutely, absolutely.
- Grades are very important.

20:25.971 --> 20:27.438
So, you know...

20:33.679 --> 20:34.679
If she puts her nose down,

20:34.713 --> 20:35.813
we give her
that little love tap.

20:36.915 --> 20:39.484
Don't whack her.
Just a little love tap.

20:39.518 --> 20:40.818
All right.

20:40.853 --> 20:42.820
And, remember, the nose
is a steering wheel, okay?

20:42.855 --> 20:44.222
So if you want her to go
this way,

20:44.256 --> 20:46.124
you want her to go this way,

20:46.158 --> 20:47.692
that's how you work with her,

20:47.726 --> 20:49.060
because you want that judge
to be able to look at

20:49.094 --> 20:51.529
every single part of
this pig's body all the time.

20:51.563 --> 20:53.331
That's part of that showmanship.

20:53.365 --> 20:54.665
You're trying to show them
it's a well-trained animal.

20:54.700 --> 20:56.968
And always keep your eye
on the judge, okay?

20:57.002 --> 20:58.503
Another part of that is
you've got to look good.

20:58.537 --> 21:00.605
So you want to tuck
in your shirt and wear a belt,

21:00.639 --> 21:02.073
and don't be chewing
any bubble gum.

21:02.107 --> 21:03.941
And don't wear a baseball cap
or anything like that.

21:03.976 --> 21:05.009
- All right?
- All right.

21:05.043 --> 21:07.345
Just remember,
don't be nervous,

21:07.379 --> 21:09.147
because if you're nervous,
she's going to be nervous.

21:09.181 --> 21:12.517
You know, Luke,
you're pretty good at this, man.

21:12.551 --> 21:14.252
Thanks.

21:17.856 --> 21:19.590
Is this your first year here?

21:19.625 --> 21:21.292
Tami Taylor.

21:21.326 --> 21:24.395
- It's right over here.
- Okay, thank you.

21:24.430 --> 21:26.731
- Tami?
- Yes?

21:26.765 --> 21:28.065
- Tami Taylor, right?
- Right.

21:28.100 --> 21:30.067
Dana Weldon, yes,
from Braymore College.

21:30.102 --> 21:31.669
- Great to see you.
- We met at West Dillon.

21:31.703 --> 21:33.638
Right. Yes, yes, yes.
Nice to see you.

21:33.672 --> 21:34.739
Good to see you.

21:34.773 --> 21:36.441
I'm actually
at East Dillon now.

21:36.475 --> 21:38.342
- Oh?
- I'm a counselor over there.

21:38.377 --> 21:40.812
Good for you. Are you going
into this next panel right now?

21:40.846 --> 21:42.980
Yeah, yeah.
Actually, I'm a panelist on it.

21:43.015 --> 21:44.115
Oh, excellent. Good.

21:44.149 --> 21:45.216
- Are you going?
- I am.

21:45.250 --> 21:46.384
All right, great.

21:46.418 --> 21:48.386
So what's going to happen
is this...

21:48.420 --> 21:50.555
They'll call you in,
you have to sit.

21:50.589 --> 21:52.290
They're going to want
to hear from Tim.

21:52.324 --> 21:53.458
But keep it brief.

21:53.492 --> 21:55.293
Wait... You're not going
to be in there?

21:55.327 --> 21:56.661
No, they don't allow counsel

21:56.695 --> 21:57.862
to be present
during the meeting.

21:57.896 --> 22:00.465
That's why I gave you
the parole packet.

22:00.499 --> 22:04.535
Okay, but, um, how do I know
when to speak, then?

22:04.570 --> 22:06.471
They'll call your name.

22:06.505 --> 22:08.573
I don't want Billy to speak.

22:08.607 --> 22:09.974
What?

22:13.111 --> 22:14.745
He's done enough damage.

22:16.081 --> 22:18.449
Tim, look, somebody's got
to speak for you.

22:18.484 --> 22:20.685
I understand that.

22:20.719 --> 22:22.253
I just don't want it to be you.

22:22.287 --> 22:24.322
Tim, I don't think
you understand

22:24.356 --> 22:25.823
how important Billy is to you.

22:25.858 --> 22:27.792
He's the family member
that you'll be living with

22:27.826 --> 22:29.894
if you get an early release.

22:29.928 --> 22:32.396
Besides, how badly
can he mess it up anyway?

22:32.431 --> 22:35.433
You'd be surprised.

22:40.806 --> 22:43.641
Getting back to the issue
of standardized testing,

22:43.675 --> 22:46.811
what improvements can be made in
regards to college admissions?

22:46.845 --> 22:48.246
Well, I think
one of the options is

22:48.280 --> 22:51.649
that Texas needs a baseline for
their standardized test scores

22:51.683 --> 22:54.318
and accountability
for those scores.

22:54.353 --> 22:56.354
Now, we can learn a lot
from looking at

22:56.388 --> 22:59.056
California's integrative
accountability system,

22:59.091 --> 23:01.626
and that has a state
academic performance index,

23:01.660 --> 23:03.094
and it's also monitoring

23:03.128 --> 23:05.363
the federal adequate
yearly process

23:05.397 --> 23:06.964
and program improvements.

23:06.999 --> 23:10.134
And I would love to just add
one thing to that, if I could.

23:10.168 --> 23:12.770
Uh, you know, I feel that
we've spent a lot of time today

23:12.804 --> 23:14.305
talking about
these standardized tests,

23:14.339 --> 23:16.040
and I think
we've already acknowledged

23:16.074 --> 23:17.775
the system is failing us.

23:17.809 --> 23:21.679
And if we continue to just
keep looking at these tests

23:21.713 --> 23:22.914
and focusing on these tests,

23:22.948 --> 23:25.316
then we will fail our students.

23:25.350 --> 23:27.218
And if we keep pushing
those kids

23:27.252 --> 23:30.154
towards the ever-important
test score,

23:30.188 --> 23:31.989
we're pushing them to fail.

23:32.024 --> 23:35.760
It seems naive to presume that
these test scores don't exist.

23:35.794 --> 23:38.529
I don't mean to presume
that they don't exist,

23:38.564 --> 23:40.932
but the students
have very different needs.

23:40.966 --> 23:44.936
And we have a responsibility
to see what those needs are

23:44.970 --> 23:46.137
and to address them.

23:46.171 --> 23:48.039
What would you have us do?

23:48.073 --> 23:50.875
Sit down with every student
in the state?

23:50.909 --> 23:52.777
Yes.

23:52.811 --> 23:54.845
I would.

23:58.483 --> 24:00.885
Very good debate.

24:00.919 --> 24:03.988
He's always been
a great little brother,

24:04.022 --> 24:05.590
just a great person.

24:05.624 --> 24:07.692
He's a good American,
and he's changed.

24:08.860 --> 24:10.294
I'm sorry.
That's not what I meant.

24:10.329 --> 24:12.029
I mean, he's still
a good American.

24:12.064 --> 24:14.332
He's just not going to get
into the kind of trouble

24:14.366 --> 24:16.467
that he got into before.

24:16.501 --> 24:20.771
I'm sorry. I wrote
all this down, but, um...

24:20.806 --> 24:22.340
The bottom line is,

24:22.374 --> 24:25.576
he's got a family that loves him
and misses him,

24:25.611 --> 24:26.877
and we'll be
a good support system

24:26.912 --> 24:28.179
for when he gets out.

24:28.213 --> 24:31.349
I've got a son who needs
to know who his uncle is.

24:31.383 --> 24:33.117
Thank you.

24:33.151 --> 24:35.186
Thank you.

24:35.220 --> 24:37.622
Now I understand we have
a letter of support

24:37.656 --> 24:39.724
from Mr. Eric Taylor.

24:39.758 --> 24:41.392
Coach Taylor.

24:41.426 --> 24:44.095
Thank you.

24:44.129 --> 24:46.530
I'm a high school
football coach.

24:46.565 --> 24:49.200
I don't think that there's
any better position

24:49.234 --> 24:50.935
to be able to judge the content

24:50.969 --> 24:52.603
of a young man's character
than that.

24:52.638 --> 24:57.875
I coached Tim for three years.

24:57.909 --> 25:02.513
He graduated, got a scholarship,
went off to college.

25:02.547 --> 25:06.283
He came back. I offered him
a job as an assistant coach.

25:06.318 --> 25:09.453
I didn't ask him
to be an assistant coach

25:09.488 --> 25:12.089
because of his skills
on the field,

25:12.124 --> 25:14.392
which we all know
were prodigious.

25:14.426 --> 25:16.560
I asked him to be part
of our team

25:16.595 --> 25:18.496
because of his character
off the field.

25:18.530 --> 25:23.067
The mistake that was made...

25:23.101 --> 25:24.969
Was tragic indeed.

25:25.003 --> 25:28.639
I think everyone in here agrees
that it was a stupid mistake.

25:28.674 --> 25:30.975
But that mistake
does not represent the man

25:31.009 --> 25:32.309
who's sitting in front of you.

25:32.344 --> 25:35.746
I can guarantee you that.

25:35.781 --> 25:39.583
He is a good young man.

25:39.618 --> 25:41.919
And that's how I know him.

25:41.953 --> 25:44.088
Thank you.

25:44.122 --> 25:46.090
Thank you, coach Taylor.

25:46.124 --> 25:48.159
That's all the business
we have...

25:48.193 --> 25:49.827
Wait, I'm here to speak, sir.

25:49.861 --> 25:52.830
I'm sorry. I don't have
anyone else on the list.

25:52.864 --> 25:55.433
Well, I'm Buddy Garrity.

25:55.467 --> 25:57.601
I've owned businesses
here in East Dillon

25:57.636 --> 25:59.537
for a long time.

25:59.571 --> 26:00.838
As you well know, Erica,

26:00.872 --> 26:03.941
you bought a Chevy Tahoe from me
about three years ago.

26:03.975 --> 26:05.810
- Mr. Garrity, I...
- Excuse me.

26:05.844 --> 26:07.845
- I'm sorry, but we normally...
- Sir, please, please.

26:07.879 --> 26:10.581
If you... if you don't mind,
please.

26:11.883 --> 26:13.684
I've known this young man

26:13.719 --> 26:16.487
since before he hit puberty.

26:16.521 --> 26:18.656
And this young man has done
a lot of things wrong.

26:18.690 --> 26:20.458
I've seen him do
a dozen things wrong,

26:20.492 --> 26:22.259
but let me tell you something
right now.

26:22.294 --> 26:23.661
He is not a bad young man,

26:23.695 --> 26:25.096
and he's certainly not
a criminal.

26:25.130 --> 26:26.831
He doesn't need to be
in this system.

26:26.865 --> 26:29.133
He dated my daughter for years,

26:29.167 --> 26:32.803
and we took him in like family,
so he's like family to me.

26:32.838 --> 26:34.238
And I could tell you
this kid right here

26:34.272 --> 26:37.308
has got more heart
than almost any person I know.

26:37.342 --> 26:41.278
And I can promise you
that when you let him out,

26:41.313 --> 26:44.482
he will have a full-time job
working for me.

26:44.516 --> 26:46.684
And I can guarantee you
that nothing like this

26:46.718 --> 26:48.452
will ever happen again.

26:48.487 --> 26:52.022
You have my word on that.

26:54.493 --> 26:57.828
It's time for you
to let Tim Riggins come home.

26:59.898 --> 27:01.699
Thank you.

27:03.502 --> 27:05.603
They tell you how long it
would take for them to decide?

27:05.637 --> 27:09.006
I've been told two weeks.

27:10.809 --> 27:13.244
Bailiff said that
you've been taking classes.

27:13.278 --> 27:16.046
Got some time off
for good behavior.

27:18.450 --> 27:22.019
Yes, sir.
Good behavior.

27:24.623 --> 27:27.258
Did you get my letters?

27:27.292 --> 27:29.894
I did.

27:32.430 --> 27:35.866
I'm sorry I didn't come
visit more.

27:35.901 --> 27:39.203
I'm sorry I let you down.

27:39.237 --> 27:40.571
You didn't,

27:40.605 --> 27:43.174
and that's not why I'm here.

27:50.148 --> 27:52.349
Thank you for coming.

28:16.107 --> 28:17.141
Hey.

28:17.175 --> 28:18.609
What's up?

28:18.643 --> 28:20.878
Nothing.

28:20.912 --> 28:24.782
Uh, you know, um...

28:24.816 --> 28:26.617
I want to talk to you
about something.

28:26.651 --> 28:28.886
Now I don't want to fight,
okay?

28:28.920 --> 28:30.988
Just hear me out.

28:34.125 --> 28:36.961
I got a call into these people.
Alabama, son.

28:36.995 --> 28:38.162
Best program in the South.

28:38.196 --> 28:39.296
Didn't I tell you I was done

28:39.331 --> 28:40.564
with all that
college recruiting stuff?

28:40.599 --> 28:42.166
I told coach Taylor
the same thing.

28:42.200 --> 28:44.134
Coach...

28:44.169 --> 28:46.103
Why you hanging on
Taylor's every word, huh?

28:46.137 --> 28:49.273
He got one foot out the door.

28:49.307 --> 28:51.542
Luke asked him straight up
was he leaving,

28:51.576 --> 28:53.210
and he said "no."

28:53.245 --> 28:55.813
- He said he ain't going nowhere.
- Come on. Think now!

28:55.847 --> 28:57.348
What? You think he's gonna
tell y'all

28:57.382 --> 28:58.616
that he's going somewhere? No!

28:58.650 --> 29:00.384
Not with the playoffs coming.

29:00.418 --> 29:01.552
He ain't no fool.

29:01.586 --> 29:03.654
Look, trust me, son.
The man has an offer.

29:03.688 --> 29:05.656
All right?
And he's going to take it.

29:05.690 --> 29:07.057
And how do you know that?

29:07.092 --> 29:09.627
Because I talked to
an assistant coach at LSU.

29:09.661 --> 29:11.395
He was up for the same job.

29:11.429 --> 29:13.631
The offer's on Taylor.

29:13.665 --> 29:15.733
Now that's when you need
to listen to me, son.

29:15.767 --> 29:18.068
I'm trying to set you up
for the future.

29:18.103 --> 29:19.570
I'm your father.

29:19.604 --> 29:21.272
I know what's right!

29:21.306 --> 29:23.607
Now what you need to be doing
is using what you got...

29:23.642 --> 29:26.010
O.! That is enough.

29:26.044 --> 29:28.379
Get off his back.

29:28.413 --> 29:30.814
Regina, I'm just telling him
how it is.

29:30.849 --> 29:32.383
No, no.
What you've been doing is

29:32.417 --> 29:35.986
is you've been smothering
this child all week, all month.

29:36.021 --> 29:38.889
He needs a father, O.,
not an agent.

really gonna leave?

29:59.477 --> 30:01.045

We just talked. That's all.

Okay, so everybody talked,
and then what did the judge say?

30:07.118 --> 30:08.252
He's not a judge, all right?

30:08.286 --> 30:09.653
It's just like three people
in a room.

I spoke.

and I came home.

what happens after this.

yelling at her?

30:21.866 --> 30:23.968

You got Buddy there.

you did everything you could,

the East Dillon football team

Some of the players

34:02.187 --> 34:04.821
and a little special tribute
for coach Taylor.

34:08.458 --> 34:11.360
Coach taught me to play hard

34:11.396 --> 34:12.629
and to leave everything out
on the field.

34:12.664 --> 34:14.130
So, thank you, coach.

34:14.165 --> 34:16.934
Yeah!

34:16.967 --> 34:20.437
When I met coach,
I was just a fat kid.

34:20.471 --> 34:24.708
I'm still a fat kid,
but he told me if I worked hard

34:24.742 --> 34:27.911
and played hard,
that he'd make me into a player,

34:27.946 --> 34:30.112
and I want to thank you
for that.

34:32.550 --> 34:36.553
Playing for coach
is... is like a dream.

34:36.588 --> 34:37.955
Some of the greatest days
of my life

34:37.989 --> 34:39.489

for you, coach.

34:39.524 --> 34:40.556
Thank you.

34:40.592 --> 34:43.493
All right!

you've really changed my life,
and I love you for that.

34:50.368 --> 34:52.235
Thank you for everything.

34:56.341 --> 35:00.577
Coach told me
that I would like football,

35:00.612 --> 35:02.112
I just didn't know it yet.

35:02.146 --> 35:04.014

Thank you.

35:11.990 --> 35:15.592
Um, coach Taylor is...

for you tonight, hon.

You don't think it was
too much on the nose, do you?

35:49.687 --> 35:53.556
Well, I think it was obvious
what they were doing,

35:53.591 --> 35:55.358
but I think it was heartfelt.

35:55.392 --> 35:57.627
I think all those people
meant what they said.

35:57.661 --> 36:00.063
And that had the desired effect.

36:00.097 --> 36:02.999
I'm sure it makes you think
twice about leaving Dillon.

36:04.368 --> 36:06.903
It's a hell of an offer.

36:06.937 --> 36:09.973
It really is.

36:10.007 --> 36:11.808

36:13.310 --> 36:16.913
- Excellent funding.
- Yeah.

recruitment dollars

orange juice in the morning.

orange juice next to a pool.

- It's nice, too.
- Ooh, that pool.

36:33.164 --> 36:35.598

But, you know what,

36:58.956 --> 37:04.494

something to think about,

37:04.528 --> 37:07.096

37:35.159 --> 37:36.526

37:38.395 --> 37:39.629
I used to hate it here.

37:39.663 --> 37:41.297
And my whole life
I always figured football

37:41.332 --> 37:42.732
was going to take me
out of here,

37:42.766 --> 37:45.201
because I couldn't imagine
staying around here,

37:45.236 --> 37:50.640
but I guess I better
try to imagine it.

37:50.674 --> 37:54.344

all these plays.

38:05.522 --> 38:08.691

you're catching a pass,

38:08.726 --> 38:10.360

41:59.923 --> 42:01.858
I plan on coming home to Dillon.

42:01.892 --> 42:05.761
And that's where I plan to stay,
at home in Dillon.

42:15.105 --> 42:17.573
You're full of surprises,
aren't you?

42:21.011 --> 42:22.345
I love you.

42:24.314 --> 42:28.184
Love you. Have a good game,
coach.
