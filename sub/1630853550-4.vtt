Previously on
Roswell, New Mexico...

00:03.438 --> 00:05.005
We have been working nonstop

00:05.048 --> 00:06.745
since we crawled out of our pod
six months ago.

00:06.789 --> 00:08.747
There's two aliens
terrorizing Roswell right now,

00:08.791 --> 00:10.488
and a third
who's God knows where.

00:10.532 --> 00:12.316
I ran into Bonnie at the Pony.

00:12.360 --> 00:14.927
Think she's more lost soul
than evil dictator.

00:14.971 --> 00:17.060
Maybe I can go undercover.
I can become her friend.

00:17.104 --> 00:18.844
MARIA:
I've been losing my powers.

00:18.888 --> 00:21.064
Think you can keep
your powers being gone

00:21.108 --> 00:22.674
a secret from Liz
forever?

00:22.718 --> 00:23.849
We found something.

00:23.893 --> 00:25.025
Something not of this Earth.

00:25.068 --> 00:27.070
What say you?I'm in.

00:27.114 --> 00:29.420
We've got a problem.
Jones is gone.

00:29.464 --> 00:32.162
My mom has gone missing again.

00:32.206 --> 00:34.164
Where do we search first?

00:43.086 --> 00:44.522
She's on the ground.
Call for help!

00:44.566 --> 00:46.046
Okay, yeah, you go.
I'll call 911.

00:46.089 --> 00:48.961
Mom, are you okay?
What happened?

00:49.005 --> 00:51.138
[weakly]:
I needed to see you.

00:51.181 --> 00:53.270
I had a vision...

00:53.314 --> 00:55.185
after the sky turned pink.

00:55.229 --> 00:56.839
Shh, okay. You should've called.

00:56.882 --> 00:58.971
You must...

00:59.015 --> 01:01.539
meet me... here.

01:03.324 --> 01:05.065
[labored breathing]

01:05.108 --> 01:09.069
Why-why do you...
feel so disconnected?

01:10.374 --> 01:12.202
My time has come,
honey.

01:12.246 --> 01:14.117
I have to go.

01:14.161 --> 01:17.381
No, no, you're not
leaving me, not now.

01:17.425 --> 01:19.557
I'll never leave you.

01:19.601 --> 01:23.387
You'll always have
the power to find me.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.959
You must...

01:30.002 --> 01:31.787
go there.

01:33.310 --> 01:34.398
Yeah?[sobs]

01:34.442 --> 01:37.227
I...
Promise me.

Maria.

02:22.185 --> 02:23.752
I'm so sorry.

02:27.625 --> 02:30.062
I found one of her
old albums in the back.

02:30.106 --> 02:32.239
[sniffles]

02:35.024 --> 02:36.460
You remember that?

02:36.504 --> 02:38.680
She was a free spirit.

02:40.029 --> 02:42.988
It's only been a few hours.
I already miss her so much.

02:43.032 --> 02:44.773
I do, too.

02:46.209 --> 02:49.734
You know, any time my mom left,
your mom was always there.

Kyle told me that Jones
is missing again.

Jones is still dead.
He can wait.

You're my sister.

Of course I'm gonna

I-It's okay

03:21.113 --> 03:23.028
for you to lean
on us right now.

03:23.072 --> 03:24.508
I know right now
you feel like

03:24.552 --> 03:26.641
your heart's been
ripped out of your chest.

03:27.598 --> 03:29.513
But you have all of us

03:29.557 --> 03:32.864

I just need a minute.

It's the "Deluca saves herself"
special in there,

03:44.006 --> 03:46.313
and I will be damned if
I sit here and do nothing,

03:46.356 --> 03:47.531
so what's going on
at Deep Sky?

03:47.575 --> 03:49.098
The cameras fritzed

03:49.141 --> 03:50.882
at the exact moment
Jones's body went missing,

03:50.926 --> 03:54.103
but nothing else is gone,
so I guess that's something.

03:54.146 --> 03:55.409
And Eduardo?

03:55.452 --> 03:56.845
I haven't connected
with him yet.

03:56.888 --> 03:58.803
Well, we're thinking
it's the third alien.

03:58.847 --> 04:01.328
I mean, it's got to be, right?
Who else would go after Jones?

04:01.371 --> 04:03.199
I'm gonna head back to the lab

04:03.243 --> 04:05.897
and figure out just
what the hell is going on.

04:05.941 --> 04:07.551
MAX:
All right.

04:07.595 --> 04:11.163
I guess, uh, Deep Sky isn't
the Fort Knox we thought it was.

04:11.990 --> 04:14.079
It's a good thing that
we didn't store this guy there.

04:14.123 --> 04:17.909
All right, well, I should
go prep my next music lesson.

04:17.953 --> 04:19.302
Bonnie's trusting me.

04:19.346 --> 04:20.651
If I can get Clyde
to do the same,

04:20.695 --> 04:22.218
I can figure out
how it all fits together.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.524
Thought you might say that,

04:23.567 --> 04:25.787
which is why Cam
brought you a tracker.

04:27.441 --> 04:29.791
No. I've seen The Departed.

Hey, Michael,
listen, man.

04:32.620 --> 04:34.448
You had a big win
at the bank yesterday.

04:34.491 --> 04:36.406
Undercover work
is dangerous.

your eye off the ball,

04:39.627 --> 04:41.933
Sometimes, we let our emotions
get the best of us.

I'm not letting my emotions
get the best of anything.

04:45.502 --> 04:47.156
Jones is gone.

04:47.199 --> 04:48.636
They've hit three banks now.

I just want to figure out
how this is all connected

04:50.159 --> 04:51.682
before anyone else gets hurt.

04:51.726 --> 04:54.076
This is exactly why
I'm asking you to be smart.

Oh, God help me, Anatsa.

05:55.964 --> 05:57.835
Why do you have to be
so perfect?

05:57.879 --> 06:01.056
Um, that's the complete opposite
of what you said last night.

06:01.099 --> 06:03.275
I know that.
I, uh...

06:03.319 --> 06:04.668
I wasn't really
in my right mind.

06:04.712 --> 06:06.409
Then tell me what you want.

06:06.453 --> 06:10.282
I want to...
talk to you, really.

06:10.326 --> 06:11.719
Then talk to me.

06:11.762 --> 06:13.373
I can tell
that there's something

06:13.416 --> 06:15.331
that you're trying to get out.

That's... [sniffles]

You should take that job.

for your career.

Glad you came
for another lesson.

Now, keep these
on the third fret.

[laughs]

07:03.292 --> 07:07.470
So, I've been wondering,
why is there no music on Oasis?

07:07.514 --> 07:10.430
Well, there used to be.

07:11.909 --> 07:15.304
They say that music
pollutes the mind.

07:15.347 --> 07:16.479
They?

07:16.523 --> 07:19.569
I spent my whole life believing

07:19.613 --> 07:21.484
everything that they said.

07:21.528 --> 07:24.008
But Earth is, like,

07:24.052 --> 07:25.706
it's proof that...

07:25.749 --> 07:27.055
that things can be
different.

07:27.098 --> 07:29.057
You know, it's good
to ask questions.

07:29.100 --> 07:31.451
Helps you figure out
what you want,

07:31.494 --> 07:32.756
where you belong.

07:32.800 --> 07:35.106
Well, that often
gets me in trouble.

07:35.150 --> 07:38.762
So...
With who?
Your boyfriend?

07:38.806 --> 07:42.070
Ew, no. Clyde is-- [laughs]
He's not my boyfriend.

07:42.113 --> 07:43.637
No?
No.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.203
He's like a big brother.

07:45.247 --> 07:46.770
Oh.

07:46.814 --> 07:49.381
He was the one that...
that brought me in.

07:49.425 --> 07:51.993
Well, who brought, uh, Clyde in?

07:54.517 --> 07:56.476
I told you this poison
rots your brain.

07:56.519 --> 07:57.738
What's going on,
Bonnie?

07:57.781 --> 08:00.001
Clyde.
Mm.

08:00.044 --> 08:01.829
You know, I've been
wanting to meet you.

08:01.872 --> 08:03.221
Yeah, 'cause it's not
every day that I meet someone

08:03.265 --> 08:05.223
who knows more
about me than myself.

08:05.267 --> 08:07.312
Ah. You want answers.

08:07.356 --> 08:09.793
My whole life,

08:09.837 --> 08:11.273
it's all I've ever wanted.

08:15.320 --> 08:16.670
Hand me your phone.

08:21.588 --> 08:25.069
Now, let's go for a ride.

08:34.209 --> 08:35.297
I'm sorry,

08:35.340 --> 08:37.778
what am I
looking at here?

08:37.821 --> 08:39.693
Where did we get
all this equipment?

08:39.736 --> 08:41.825
I told Shivani I knew
about alien science.

08:41.869 --> 08:43.958
Don't worry,
that's all she knows.

08:44.001 --> 08:47.048
And no one's gonna just come
barging through that door?

08:47.091 --> 08:49.180
Shivani agreed
to a closed-door policy.

08:49.224 --> 08:51.008
All right, uh, Dr. Dyson,

08:51.052 --> 08:54.011
why don't you tell me about
this, uh, alien ectoplasm, hmm?

08:54.055 --> 08:56.579
Oh, I prefer the term "goo,"

08:56.623 --> 08:59.669
but it's technically
epidermal tissue.

08:59.713 --> 09:01.932
Mm-hmm.

09:01.976 --> 09:03.804
Okay.

09:03.847 --> 09:07.721
Third helix is present.
It's definitely alien.

09:08.635 --> 09:09.853
Hey, Liz, a second.

09:09.897 --> 09:12.856
Yeah.After everything
with Mimi,

09:12.900 --> 09:15.163
you sure you're up for this?

09:15.206 --> 09:18.383
I'm fine. I, um...

09:18.427 --> 09:20.429
can use the distraction,
actually.

09:21.604 --> 09:24.564
I sent Maria two texts, and all
I got back was a "thumbs up,"

09:24.607 --> 09:27.479
so... I must've said
something dumb.

09:28.437 --> 09:32.484
And if I can't help her,
maybe I can help us.

09:32.528 --> 09:34.095
Okay.

09:34.138 --> 09:37.577
All right,
here we go.

09:44.322 --> 09:47.674
ISOBEL:
Um, what just happened?

09:52.069 --> 09:55.246
Oh, please, please,
no more casseroles.

09:55.290 --> 09:59.990
Uh, Arturo sent 'Cosmic cakes
and Crashbrowns.

10:00.034 --> 10:01.862
I just volunteered
to deliver them.

10:01.905 --> 10:03.733
You just don't give up, do you?

10:03.777 --> 10:05.909
It's a minister's job
to offer guidance,

10:05.953 --> 10:08.259
and I think you should
talk to your friends.

10:08.303 --> 10:09.826
Look, don't you think
I know that?

10:09.870 --> 10:12.263
My life would be
so much easier if I just

10:12.307 --> 10:14.352
told Liz I lost my vision,
and then,

10:14.396 --> 10:17.747
maybe, I would have some
fighting chance at figuring out

10:17.791 --> 10:20.924
what it is my mom thought
was worth dying for.

10:20.968 --> 10:22.622
I mean, if Liz can
solve this problem,

10:22.665 --> 10:24.536
then maybe she should
drop everything to help you.

10:24.580 --> 10:26.103
No.

10:26.147 --> 10:28.628
She's working hard
at her "eat, pray, Liz" thing.

10:28.671 --> 10:29.933
Okay, what about Isobel?

10:29.977 --> 10:31.631
Or Michael?[sighs]

10:31.674 --> 10:33.371
Look, all I'm saying is
they've got dope powers, too,

10:33.415 --> 10:34.459
you know. You never know...

10:34.503 --> 10:35.939
Their powers cannot fix me.

10:35.983 --> 10:38.028
What do you know
about powers anyway?

10:38.072 --> 10:39.551
Shouldn't you be somewhere

10:39.595 --> 10:41.205
focused on your own
prepubescent abilities,

10:41.249 --> 10:42.990
instead of trying to fix
the ones that I lost?

10:44.731 --> 10:46.646
I'm sorry.

10:46.689 --> 10:48.691
Um...

10:48.735 --> 10:51.302
No, no, uh, y-you're right

10:51.346 --> 10:52.477
about some of that.

10:52.521 --> 10:53.870
No, this isn't about you.

10:53.914 --> 10:56.568
If I'd just admitted
that I was powerless,

10:56.612 --> 10:57.918
then maybe my mom
would've told me

10:57.961 --> 11:01.530
exactly what
she wanted me to know,

11:01.573 --> 11:02.705
but I just froze.

11:02.749 --> 11:04.098
Don't you dare
blame yourself

11:04.141 --> 11:05.839
for not thinking clearly
at a time like this.

11:05.882 --> 11:07.405
We will figure out

11:07.449 --> 11:10.060
whatever it is that your mom
wanted you to see.

11:10.104 --> 11:12.715
But you can't do that,
until you...

11:12.759 --> 11:15.196
until you let go of that guilt.

11:16.719 --> 11:18.155
I don't know how.

11:22.856 --> 11:25.815
Well, why don't you
ask her?

11:27.208 --> 11:30.385
I don't know. She don't seem
so powerless to me.

11:34.563 --> 11:36.391
[door creaks open]

11:39.524 --> 11:41.091
[door slams shut]

11:43.224 --> 11:45.617
Oh, pomegranate
wine coolers.

11:45.661 --> 11:46.923
Busting out the good stuff.

11:46.967 --> 11:48.359
Isn't that the customs here?

11:48.403 --> 11:50.666
Share some brewskis,
shoot the shizzel.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.103
Mm, don't think Snoop
would put it quite that way.

11:53.147 --> 11:56.672
Bonnie clearly likes you.

11:56.716 --> 11:57.847
Why is that?

11:57.891 --> 12:01.372
Uh, she appreciates my sarcasm

12:01.416 --> 12:03.331
and my on point
taste in music?

12:03.374 --> 12:05.246
Why did you bust us
out of that bank?

12:05.289 --> 12:07.814
I don't want to see you
end up in a cage.

12:08.771 --> 12:10.164
Why do you care?

12:10.207 --> 12:11.818
Met the sheriff the other day.

12:11.861 --> 12:13.384
It's pretty clear
that he feels differently.

12:13.428 --> 12:15.299
Well, if you'd done
your research,

12:15.343 --> 12:17.649
you would know that I have
a pretty impressive rap sheet.

12:17.693 --> 12:21.044
That sheriff and I have
never seen eye to eye.

12:21.088 --> 12:22.872
And you think you and I will?

12:22.916 --> 12:25.701
It's lonely being
the only one in this town

12:25.745 --> 12:27.398
who colors
outside the lines, okay?

12:28.617 --> 12:30.967
Hmm.

12:31.011 --> 12:32.708
Bonnie and I felt
like that once.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.405
Then we met someone

12:34.449 --> 12:37.887
who showed us how to be
bigger than ourselves.

12:37.931 --> 12:39.367
Jones.

12:39.410 --> 12:40.803
You knew him?

12:40.847 --> 12:42.326
Not well,

12:42.370 --> 12:44.938
but he seemed to have
it all figured out.

12:44.981 --> 12:47.244
[scoffs] He was a visionary.

12:47.288 --> 12:50.421
He showed us
what the world could be.

12:50.465 --> 12:51.858
What can the world be?

12:51.901 --> 12:54.556
[chuckles]

12:58.952 --> 13:01.345
[door opens]

13:02.433 --> 13:04.914
This is where Shivani's tech
found the alien sample.

13:04.958 --> 13:06.655
There's got
to be more.

13:06.698 --> 13:09.179
Okay, that's a cool little
magic wand you MacGyvered.Yeah.

13:09.223 --> 13:10.615
I rigged it so that
it would locate

13:10.659 --> 13:13.096
the alien tech component
in alien biology.

13:13.140 --> 13:15.359
I mean, at least
I hope I did.
Hey, hey.

13:15.403 --> 13:17.797
Can you just
slow down for a sec?

13:17.840 --> 13:19.059
What's wrong, Liz?

13:19.102 --> 13:20.538
When I ruined
that skin sample,

13:20.582 --> 13:22.323
I killed our only lead.

13:23.585 --> 13:27.154
[sighs] I-I-I-I-I haven't been
thinking clearly.

13:27.197 --> 13:30.853
Is it because of Jones,
or Maria?

13:30.897 --> 13:32.463
I don't know. I don't know.

13:32.507 --> 13:35.292
On one hand, I'm terrified
because Jones is gone,

13:35.336 --> 13:37.251
and if I don't figure out
exactly who we are up against,

13:37.294 --> 13:40.210
then there is a chance that we
have to face off with him again.

13:40.254 --> 13:41.951
And then, on
the other hand,

13:41.995 --> 13:43.474
I can't stop thinking
about Maria.

13:43.518 --> 13:45.476
I mean, she's got
to feel so alone.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.000
Max, Mimi was her world.

13:47.043 --> 13:50.699
Yesterday, you told me
to trust you.

13:50.742 --> 13:52.875
All right?
So now it's your turn.

13:52.919 --> 13:54.877
Okay? We will find
the sample,

13:54.921 --> 13:56.270
we will find Jones...[sighs]

13:56.313 --> 13:58.576
...and we will find
that third alien.

13:58.620 --> 13:59.882
Aren't you afraid?

13:59.926 --> 14:01.014
Well, of course I am,

14:01.057 --> 14:02.929
but I'm putting
all that aside

14:02.972 --> 14:06.280
because I'm putting
my faith in you.

14:07.977 --> 14:09.196
Okay.

14:10.066 --> 14:12.329
[spectrometer beeping]

14:12.373 --> 14:13.504
Oh.

14:13.548 --> 14:15.550
Something's buried here.

14:16.551 --> 14:19.989
Um, I'll have Senovative
dig it out.

14:20.033 --> 14:22.818
No, no, no. It's--
That'll take too long. I...

14:22.862 --> 14:23.993
I got this.

14:24.037 --> 14:26.169
Hey, yesterday...Was yesterday.

14:26.213 --> 14:29.172
All right? You said that,
together, we can do anything.

14:30.086 --> 14:32.001
So let's prove it.

14:34.482 --> 14:35.526
Okay.

14:38.921 --> 14:41.837
[high-pitched ringing]

14:41.881 --> 14:44.057
[ground rumbling]

14:45.449 --> 14:47.190
[straining]

15:10.910 --> 15:12.433
[whoops]

15:14.174 --> 15:17.438
You... you are
my turquoise.

15:18.700 --> 15:20.354
You focus me.

15:32.061 --> 15:33.976
[sighs] I really need
to talk to security.

15:34.020 --> 15:36.500
I am here to help you. Now,
I know that the cameras fritzed,

15:36.544 --> 15:38.763
but, uh, what else you got
on Jones' Great Escape?

15:38.807 --> 15:41.505
[chuckles]
Uh, no thanks.

15:41.549 --> 15:43.594
Not unless you're moonlighting
as a private eye.

15:43.638 --> 15:44.944
[chuckles]

15:46.032 --> 15:47.816
That was sent
to Eduardo.

15:47.859 --> 15:50.775
It was postmarked a few months
ago from a town called Careyes.

15:50.819 --> 15:52.864
Now, a quick Internet
search told me that Careyes

15:52.908 --> 15:55.128
is a town where people
put ladders up on their roofs

15:55.171 --> 15:57.434
to welcome in the Sky Gods.

15:58.305 --> 16:00.524
Who's your Sam Spade now, baby?

16:01.786 --> 16:03.963
You know, my family's
actually from Careyes.

16:04.006 --> 16:05.399
I've never been,

16:05.442 --> 16:07.009
but Eduardo says
it's nothing but a tourist trap.

16:07.053 --> 16:08.489
Oh, you mean like Roswell?

16:08.532 --> 16:11.622
It doesn't matter.
This isn't addressed to you.

16:11.666 --> 16:13.276
Wait.All's fair in love and war.

16:13.320 --> 16:16.149
[stammers] That is
a federal crime.

16:17.802 --> 16:18.934
Whoa.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.980
What?
"There are things

16:21.023 --> 16:25.027
"in Careyes
you'd find interesting.

16:25.071 --> 16:26.811
Ask for Xitlali."

16:26.855 --> 16:28.726
All right.
Let's suit up.

16:28.770 --> 16:31.512
Mm-hmm.
This symbol
has followed me around

16:31.555 --> 16:33.340
like a bad tweet my whole life.

16:33.383 --> 16:35.342
Add that to an
Aztec Sky God,

16:35.385 --> 16:37.997
I'd bet we have the place
that Jones stashed his plan B.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.476
Now, I think
we should go down there,

16:39.520 --> 16:41.739
we find the source of all this,
we make it stop,

16:41.783 --> 16:43.437
and then we drown ourselves
in mescal.

16:43.480 --> 16:47.049
You didn't come clean
to Anatsa...

16:47.093 --> 16:49.051
did you?

16:49.095 --> 16:50.966
I tried, and I couldn't,

16:51.010 --> 16:53.577
so now I'm pretty sure
that I never will be able to.

16:53.621 --> 16:55.492
[sighs]

16:56.450 --> 16:58.017
It's that pink rain, man.

16:58.060 --> 16:59.453
Ever since that pink rain,
I have not been happy.

16:59.496 --> 17:01.759
You're not alone there.

17:06.590 --> 17:08.505
Well, uh,
I saw some construction

17:08.549 --> 17:10.507
out by the highway near
Deep Sky, so I'm gonna go see

17:10.551 --> 17:13.032
if the roadside cameras
caught anything.

17:16.122 --> 17:17.427
[door opens]

17:17.471 --> 17:21.170
Hey, how about
a taste from Oasis?

17:24.782 --> 17:27.046
Or are you worried
it might be poison?

17:28.134 --> 17:29.396
[chuckles]

17:34.096 --> 17:38.057
[laughs]This tastes like every feeling
I've ever had.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.188
How do you have this?

17:39.232 --> 17:40.624
We brought it on our ship.

17:40.668 --> 17:43.105
Yeah, well, sadly,
we're in short supply,

17:43.149 --> 17:46.369
but I can show you
where it came from.

17:55.204 --> 17:58.251
[sighs]

17:59.078 --> 18:00.514
[chittering]

18:00.557 --> 18:03.430
Is that...
an Oasian salamander?

18:05.562 --> 18:07.260
Yeah, we call
them Fortune.

18:07.303 --> 18:08.913
It's good luck
if you see one.

18:08.957 --> 18:11.090
Not so much if they bite you.
Their venom is deadly.

18:11.786 --> 18:14.310
That is the tree
that bears the fruits.

18:17.008 --> 18:18.401
She's sacred.

18:18.445 --> 18:20.360
Why would you ever
leave this place?

18:20.403 --> 18:21.578
It was our Savior's will.

18:21.622 --> 18:25.147
Were you on my ship?We were.

18:25.191 --> 18:27.149
So, where have you
been all this time?

18:27.193 --> 18:28.455
In stasis

18:28.498 --> 18:31.153
till we were called upon.By Jones?

18:31.197 --> 18:32.328
Yeah.

18:32.372 --> 18:35.288
Are there more of you?

18:37.638 --> 18:39.422
Jones said our kind form triads,

18:39.466 --> 18:41.816
so there must be
a third, right?

18:41.859 --> 18:43.644
I mean, unless Jones
is your third.

18:43.687 --> 18:44.862
No.

18:45.776 --> 18:48.649
Of course not.Okay, playtime's over.

18:49.824 --> 18:52.131
Hey, my bad.

18:52.174 --> 18:53.567
I have questions.

18:53.610 --> 18:57.179
You've been to this place, man,
I haven't.

18:57.223 --> 18:58.876
'Cause you're not
asking about Oasis,

18:58.920 --> 19:00.095
you're asking about Jones.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.228
I don't care about Jones

19:02.271 --> 19:03.664
because Jones is dead, right?

19:03.707 --> 19:06.797
Okay. Why are you really here?

19:06.841 --> 19:09.104
I just told you.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.932
Oh, you're looking
for something?

19:10.975 --> 19:12.063
No.Or someone? Hey.

19:12.107 --> 19:13.326
Did someone
follow us?

19:13.369 --> 19:15.241
Clyde. You broke his phone.

19:15.284 --> 19:17.156
His clone friend's
a cop, Bonnie.

19:17.199 --> 19:18.809
Enough. You're being paranoid.

19:18.853 --> 19:21.290
If so, then he won't mind me
searching him,

19:21.334 --> 19:23.553
see if he has any secrets
up his sleeve.

19:28.471 --> 19:31.779
Your visionary? He's my father.

19:33.215 --> 19:35.304
And I'm just
like him.

19:35.348 --> 19:38.177
So, will you please tell me

19:38.220 --> 19:40.004
what my role is in all of this.

19:40.048 --> 19:42.920
We're gonna need a minute.

19:43.965 --> 19:45.445
Bonnie.

19:53.844 --> 19:55.106
Hey.

19:55.150 --> 19:57.239
Hey.
Hey.

19:57.283 --> 19:58.545
Whoa.

20:00.242 --> 20:01.591
Where did you get that?

20:03.376 --> 20:05.813
The, uh, owner of the truck
Max found.

20:05.856 --> 20:07.902
She claims she met someone
from Careyes,

20:07.945 --> 20:10.818
then woke up in it after
losing a week of her life.

20:10.861 --> 20:13.516
Great. Memory loss,
missing time.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.170
That reminds me of Noah.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.259
Yeah, mind control's kind of
what we're thinking, too.

20:17.303 --> 20:18.565
Well, and no one
has seen Eduardo

20:18.608 --> 20:20.044
since yesterday, but Isobel...

20:20.088 --> 20:25.267
She found this on the
construction crew's camera.

20:25.311 --> 20:27.313
She matches Renata's
description.

20:27.356 --> 20:30.229
I think we're looking at
our third alien.

20:42.545 --> 20:45.331
Okay. Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

20:45.374 --> 20:48.508
Got to be a phone somewhere.

20:52.120 --> 20:54.253
[man coughing]

20:54.296 --> 20:56.255
[man sighs]

20:57.952 --> 21:00.084
Michael.

21:00.128 --> 21:01.782
I'm getting you out of here.

21:02.696 --> 21:04.741
Why are your eyes blue?

21:04.785 --> 21:07.483
[stammers] I don't know.
I... All I remember

21:07.527 --> 21:09.659
is running into someone
out on the highway,

21:09.703 --> 21:12.401
and then I woke up here.
Is she here? Did you see her?

21:12.445 --> 21:13.620
Who?
The woman.

21:13.663 --> 21:16.057
You talking about
the third alien?

21:16.100 --> 21:17.537
No, but her friends are here.

21:17.580 --> 21:18.929
How did you even find me?

21:18.973 --> 21:20.757
Max let me play
Donnie Brasco.What?

21:20.801 --> 21:23.282
I know. Don't be
too impressed, though.

21:23.325 --> 21:24.979
I pushed too hard, I got made.

21:25.022 --> 21:26.589
If that's true,
then where are they?

21:26.633 --> 21:28.591
They're outside
planning my untimely end.

21:28.635 --> 21:32.291
I sort of blurted out
that I'm Jones's son.

21:32.334 --> 21:33.944
I jumped the gun.

21:33.988 --> 21:35.946
You did exactly
what you should've.

21:35.990 --> 21:38.384
If they were going to kill you,
they would've done it by now.

21:38.427 --> 21:40.124
Clyde isn't exactly
an open book.

21:40.168 --> 21:41.430
No good criminal is.

21:41.474 --> 21:44.868
Undercover work
is like... poker.

21:44.912 --> 21:46.392
You never know exactly
what they're thinking,

21:46.435 --> 21:49.133
but one thing's for sure,
if you run,

21:49.177 --> 21:50.831
they've called your bluff.

21:53.007 --> 21:54.617
[sighs]

21:56.053 --> 21:59.318
Let me ask you this,
do you think they're all bad?

22:01.668 --> 22:03.539
No, I think some of them
are just lost.

22:03.583 --> 22:06.150
This isn't my first kidnapping.

22:06.194 --> 22:07.935
I can escape on my own.

22:09.371 --> 22:11.330
Don't give up.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.521
MIMI:
Hey.

22:28.564 --> 22:30.044
It's Teen Witchtonight,

22:30.087 --> 22:32.916
if I can fix this spool
before curtain.

22:32.960 --> 22:34.004
Sounds stupid.

22:34.048 --> 22:35.963
Teen Witchis a cult classic.

22:36.006 --> 22:38.400
I think you and Ty
would really enjoy it.

22:38.444 --> 22:40.446
Yeah, well,
I'm gonna have to pass

22:40.489 --> 22:43.318
because Ty just dumped me

22:43.362 --> 22:44.450
for Lindsay Lewis.

22:44.493 --> 22:46.060
No.

22:48.671 --> 22:51.979
Did I ever told you why
I volunteer my time

22:52.022 --> 22:55.069
tinkering with this
old projector?

22:55.112 --> 22:56.375
Free movie tickets.

22:56.418 --> 22:59.203
Film captures the soul.

22:59.247 --> 23:00.988
A good movie can

23:01.031 --> 23:03.033
change the whole way
you see the world.

23:03.077 --> 23:05.296
You know, I don't think
that Teen Witch

23:05.340 --> 23:08.125
is gonna change the way
I see Ty and Lindsey.

23:08.169 --> 23:09.736
Give me your hand.

23:09.779 --> 23:11.172
Hmm...

23:11.215 --> 23:13.609
See here?

23:13.653 --> 23:16.699
This is the intersection
of your love and life lines,

23:16.743 --> 23:20.442
and it says you have
quite a few more years

23:20.486 --> 23:24.403
before you walk down the aisle
with Mr. Right. Sorry.

23:24.446 --> 23:26.492
That supposed to
make me feel better?

23:26.535 --> 23:28.842
You're in high school.

23:28.885 --> 23:30.539
Nothing's supposed to
make you feel better.

23:30.583 --> 23:32.541
Except maybe

23:32.585 --> 23:35.239
seeing Teen Witchtonight
with your mom.

23:35.283 --> 23:37.416
[sighs]

23:37.459 --> 23:38.460
Fine.

23:38.504 --> 23:40.941
[chuckles]

23:45.598 --> 23:47.948
Love and life lines?

23:48.949 --> 23:51.952
She wants me to go
to her wedding.

23:53.954 --> 23:55.216
Oh, wait.

23:55.259 --> 23:56.739
Eduardo was mind-controlled?

23:56.783 --> 23:58.567
Yeah, we think he's the one
that stole Jones's body.

23:58.611 --> 24:00.569
Oh, my God. Is he okay?

24:00.613 --> 24:01.962
Well, he's still missing.

24:02.005 --> 24:03.746
But the good news is
that Kyle and Isobel

24:03.790 --> 24:04.921
found a photo of
our third alien.

24:04.965 --> 24:06.923
We think
they're together, so...

24:06.967 --> 24:08.490
Cam and I are gonna
start looking

24:08.534 --> 24:09.578
where Michael's tracker
last pinged.

24:09.622 --> 24:11.101
Oh, okay, well...

24:11.145 --> 24:13.843
Wait, if you don't need Kyle,
can I borrow him?

24:13.887 --> 24:16.759
I could use his help sniffing
out some more alien DNA samples.

24:16.803 --> 24:19.196
MAX:
Well, I wish I could
loan him to you,

24:19.240 --> 24:21.590
but he went down to
Mexico, following a lead.

24:21.634 --> 24:23.070
You should probably hop out.

24:23.113 --> 24:24.463
We got to release this truck
back to its...

24:24.506 --> 24:26.116
What are you doing in my rig?

24:26.160 --> 24:27.378
...owner.

24:27.422 --> 24:28.771
Uh, my colleague was just

24:28.815 --> 24:31.557
finishing up
her sweep of your cab.

24:32.601 --> 24:34.777
How long have you had blue eyes?

24:35.648 --> 24:36.823
Since I blacked out
and found myself

24:36.866 --> 24:38.477
in someone else's clothes.

24:38.520 --> 24:40.174
Worst part is,

24:40.217 --> 24:43.177
now my Van Morrison tattoo
doesn't make any sense.

24:51.533 --> 24:54.971
I am not mounting a national
search party to find an alien.

24:55.015 --> 24:57.626
What are you
doing here anyway?

24:57.670 --> 24:59.802
You know, last I checked,
I'm still the only

24:59.846 --> 25:01.891
legallyblonde gunslinger
in town.

25:01.935 --> 25:03.284
You ever wonder
if maybe gunslingers

25:03.327 --> 25:04.938
aren't really as tough
as they look?

25:04.981 --> 25:06.722
You know, I mean, it's
easy to romanticize

25:06.766 --> 25:09.159
being out there at dawn with
nothing but a quick hand

25:09.203 --> 25:10.509
and steel bullets, you know,

25:10.552 --> 25:11.988
but holistically speaking,
I mean,

25:12.032 --> 25:13.642
don't you think a lot of them
probably had

25:13.686 --> 25:15.296
some pretty intense
psychological issues?

25:15.339 --> 25:16.689
Is this a trick question?

25:16.732 --> 25:18.386
No, I'm just, you
know, I'm just saying.

25:18.429 --> 25:20.170
It's-it's easy to know what
to do when you're playing

25:20.214 --> 25:21.563
The Quick and the Dead
with an evil overlord,

25:21.607 --> 25:22.999
you know,
but when it comes to how

25:23.043 --> 25:24.566
we treat people that we love,
it's just...

25:24.610 --> 25:26.960
This is about Maria.

25:27.003 --> 25:29.484
Yeah, I guess, um, everything
that happened with Mimi,

25:29.528 --> 25:31.268
it just made me realize how...

25:31.312 --> 25:34.010
how easy it is to lose someone
that you love.

25:34.054 --> 25:35.664
Just because Max is proposing

25:35.708 --> 25:37.710
does not mean
you're gonna lose him.

25:39.363 --> 25:41.670
You... you didn't know?

25:41.714 --> 25:42.715
No, I did not.

25:42.758 --> 25:44.325
Doesn't matter.

25:44.368 --> 25:46.370
Max and Liz decided to wait.

25:46.414 --> 25:50.505
So-so my brother found the balls
to get down on one knee

25:50.549 --> 25:52.202
and meanwhile, I,

25:52.246 --> 25:54.727
for some inexplicable reason,
lose all nerve

25:54.770 --> 25:57.599
when it comes
to telling my own truth?

25:58.469 --> 25:59.688
You're in love.

25:59.732 --> 26:02.212
It's horrible, Cameron.

26:02.256 --> 26:03.953
And instead of cherishing
my beautiful girlfriend,

26:03.997 --> 26:06.869
I just told her to move
halfway across the state.

26:06.913 --> 26:10.569
I have been horrible
to her all week,

26:10.612 --> 26:12.222
and I can't stop
because she is a reporter

26:12.266 --> 26:13.746
who is chasing a story,
you know?

26:13.789 --> 26:15.356
And if she knew the truth
about me, then...

26:15.399 --> 26:20.100
She might just expose your
alien pedigree to the world?

26:21.928 --> 26:23.799
You really think she'd do that?

26:27.673 --> 26:28.761
No.

26:28.804 --> 26:33.330
Sounds to me like Anatsa

26:33.374 --> 26:36.072
is the first person
you've really cared about

26:36.116 --> 26:37.291
since your ex.

26:37.334 --> 26:38.988
My guess is,

26:39.032 --> 26:42.296
you're afraid that if you open
your heart to her,

26:42.339 --> 26:44.080
she might shatter it.

26:44.124 --> 26:45.865
All right.

26:45.908 --> 26:49.129
You got me, Annie Oakley.

26:51.653 --> 26:53.612
Must be nice being bulletproof.

26:53.655 --> 26:57.659
Beneath this
gunslinger bravado

26:57.703 --> 27:01.271
was a young, stupid deputy

27:01.315 --> 27:04.623
in love
with your stupid brother.

27:04.666 --> 27:06.886
But I never found
the courage to tell him.

27:06.929 --> 27:08.888
Sometimes I still wonder,
if I had,

27:08.931 --> 27:11.673
if things would be
different, but...

27:13.501 --> 27:15.982
Yeah, well, that's over now.

27:16.025 --> 27:17.897
Oh, Cam.

27:19.681 --> 27:21.074
I had no idea.

27:21.117 --> 27:24.077
That's kind of the point
of the story.

27:34.522 --> 27:35.958
What are you doing here?

27:37.786 --> 27:39.092
You can't leave yet.

27:39.135 --> 27:41.137
I have something
that I need to say.

27:41.181 --> 27:43.531
You've been needing to say
something for a week now.

27:43.574 --> 27:44.793
I know.

27:44.837 --> 27:47.753
But I was scared
how you would react.

27:47.796 --> 27:49.363
And you're not scared anymore?

27:49.406 --> 27:52.235
No. I'm terrified.

27:53.149 --> 27:55.064
But I need you to
know the real me.

27:55.108 --> 27:58.981
I'm sorry that I lied to you

27:59.025 --> 28:01.680
about Max and Cameron
working together.

28:03.029 --> 28:05.248
But most of all, I am sorry

28:05.292 --> 28:07.903
for any time that I have
pushed you away,

28:07.947 --> 28:10.819
because all I want is
to be close to you.

28:10.863 --> 28:16.042
Anatsa, you are... perfect.

28:17.130 --> 28:20.437
And I am completely
in love with you.

28:23.745 --> 28:27.140
There is a cave that is a mile
and a half away from here,

28:27.183 --> 28:29.055
and I know this
sounds creepy,

28:29.098 --> 28:31.318
but I need you to come with me
because it's gonna help me

28:31.361 --> 28:32.798
explain who I really am.

28:32.841 --> 28:36.105
So, what do you
say, cowgirl? Hmm?

28:37.411 --> 28:40.066
Will you ride off
into the sunset with me?

28:43.852 --> 28:45.549
This...
[laughs softly]

28:45.593 --> 28:48.378
...roller coaster that we're on,

28:48.422 --> 28:50.293
it's been more
than I can handle.

28:51.773 --> 28:53.949
My heart is broken, Isobel.

28:53.993 --> 28:56.865
It's not that I don't love you,
it's just...

28:56.909 --> 29:00.216
for me, love can't be
this complicated.

29:00.260 --> 29:01.914
[exhales]

29:04.003 --> 29:05.526
I hope you figure this out.

'Cause you deserve to be happy.

29:29.811 --> 29:32.074
Had a little trouble
finding your outhouse.

29:32.118 --> 29:34.990
You should consider plumbing.

29:35.034 --> 29:37.166
It's a prize of the modern age.

29:37.210 --> 29:41.170
I heard stories about
the Engineer and the Savior,

29:41.214 --> 29:43.999
I just never imagined
they had a child.

29:44.043 --> 29:46.959
Never imagined
I was heir to a throne.

29:47.002 --> 29:51.659
What do you say we put
our, um, skepticism aside?

29:51.702 --> 29:53.748
You're his son,

29:53.792 --> 29:55.315
I'm his star pupil.

29:55.358 --> 29:57.970
I bet there's a lot
we can learn from each other.

30:01.582 --> 30:02.888
That's what I'm here for.

30:09.198 --> 30:10.721
MICHAEL:That's from
Las Cruces Bank.

Open it.

[high-pitched ringing]

30:15.857 --> 30:17.772
MICHAEL:
What are they for?

30:17.816 --> 30:20.296
They are pieces of
a larger puzzle.

30:34.267 --> 30:36.747
All that's missing is that piece
from West Pecos Bank and Trust.

30:36.791 --> 30:38.793
Yeah, and when
you retrieve it,

30:38.837 --> 30:40.664
you'll be able to see
what this skilled piece

30:40.708 --> 30:42.101
of engineering can do.

30:43.319 --> 30:45.582
Rumor has it
your mother built it.

30:49.456 --> 30:51.501
♪

30:54.809 --> 30:57.333
Been here three hours
and no one knows Xitlali.

30:57.377 --> 30:59.292
Not even at my family's
tequila distillery.

30:59.335 --> 31:01.816
How did that trucker
volunteer her eye DNA?

31:01.860 --> 31:03.731
I sort of made her cry
and then I asked for a Kleenex.

31:03.774 --> 31:05.515
Wow, that bedside manner.

31:05.559 --> 31:08.127
I just, I have to figure out
what changed Renata's eye color

31:08.170 --> 31:10.129
and the last time
that I touched alien DNA,

31:10.172 --> 31:12.261
it literally turned to dust.

31:12.305 --> 31:14.873
So I need my old partner
to help me.

31:14.916 --> 31:16.004
What does the science say?

31:16.048 --> 31:17.397
It's definitely alien.

31:17.440 --> 31:18.789
I mean, whatever happened
left trace DNA

31:18.833 --> 31:20.226
in Renata's system.

31:20.269 --> 31:21.880
And there was no exchange
of genetic material

31:21.923 --> 31:24.143
when Sheriff Taylor or Isobel
were mind-controlled.

31:24.186 --> 31:25.971
Maybe our alien carries
a mutated gene

31:26.014 --> 31:28.887
that makes her more,
um... evolved.

31:28.930 --> 31:30.279
Or maybe involved.

31:30.323 --> 31:33.065
Uh, w-what if the DNA
acts as an anchor,

31:33.108 --> 31:34.240
you know, in the way
that the handprint does,

31:34.283 --> 31:35.719
so that it could give her

31:35.763 --> 31:36.982
better control of her victims?

31:37.025 --> 31:38.157
Add the dye.

31:38.200 --> 31:39.549
It might give you a better idea

31:39.593 --> 31:40.899

You know, when my daughter
went through her sickness,

34:10.744 --> 34:13.877
I struggled for months
to see through the pain.

34:13.921 --> 34:19.057
You know, all day, I have been
refusing to let the pain win.

34:20.101 --> 34:22.364
I think it still won.

34:22.408 --> 34:24.192
Because you're not
acknowledging it.

34:24.236 --> 34:26.542
You give yourself
permission to grieve,

34:26.586 --> 34:28.588
and you will find
your footing again.

I wanted to hear.

is not without expectations.
