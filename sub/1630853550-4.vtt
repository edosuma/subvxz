WEBVTT

00:02.263 --> 00:03.394
Previously on
Roswell, New Mexico...

00:03.438 --> 00:05.005
We have been working nonstop

00:05.048 --> 00:06.745
since we crawled out of our pod
six months ago.

00:06.789 --> 00:08.747
There's two aliens
terrorizing Roswell right now,

00:08.791 --> 00:10.488
and a third
who's God knows where.

00:10.532 --> 00:12.316
I ran into Bonnie at the Pony.

00:12.360 --> 00:14.927
Think she's more lost soul
than evil dictator.

00:14.971 --> 00:17.060
Maybe I can go undercover.
I can become her friend.

00:17.104 --> 00:18.844
MARIA:
I've been losing my powers.

00:18.888 --> 00:21.064
Think you can keep
your powers being gone

00:21.108 --> 00:22.674
a secret from Liz
forever?

00:22.718 --> 00:23.849
We found something.

00:23.893 --> 00:25.025
Something not of this Earth.

00:25.068 --> 00:27.070
What say you?I'm in.

00:27.114 --> 00:29.420
We've got a problem.
Jones is gone.

00:29.464 --> 00:32.162
My mom has gone missing again.

00:32.206 --> 00:34.164
Where do we search first?

00:43.086 --> 00:44.522
She's on the ground.
Call for help!

00:44.566 --> 00:46.046
Okay, yeah, you go.
I'll call 911.

00:46.089 --> 00:48.961
Mom, are you okay?
What happened?

00:49.005 --> 00:51.138
[weakly]:
I needed to see you.

00:51.181 --> 00:53.270
I had a vision...

00:53.314 --> 00:55.185
after the sky turned pink.

00:55.229 --> 00:56.839
Shh, okay. You should've called.

00:56.882 --> 00:58.971
You must...

00:59.015 --> 01:01.539
meet me... here.

01:03.324 --> 01:05.065
[labored breathing]

01:05.108 --> 01:09.069
Why-why do you...
feel so disconnected?

01:10.374 --> 01:12.202
My time has come,
honey.

01:12.246 --> 01:14.117
I have to go.

01:14.161 --> 01:17.381
No, no, you're not
leaving me, not now.

01:17.425 --> 01:19.557
I'll never leave you.

01:19.601 --> 01:23.387
You'll always have
the power to find me.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.959
You must...

01:30.002 --> 01:31.787
go there.

01:33.310 --> 01:34.398
Yeah?[sobs]

01:34.442 --> 01:37.227
I...
Promise me.

01:37.271 --> 01:40.622
I promise. I promise.

01:43.407 --> 01:44.843
[slow exhale]
Mom?

01:44.887 --> 01:46.845
Mom. Mom!

01:46.889 --> 01:49.370
No. No. [crying]

02:00.076 --> 02:02.296
â™ª

02:06.778 --> 02:08.519
[sighs]

02:08.563 --> 02:10.739
Hey.

02:15.265 --> 02:16.962
[sighs]

02:17.006 --> 02:18.355
Maria.

02:22.185 --> 02:23.752
I'm so sorry.

02:27.625 --> 02:30.062
I found one of her
old albums in the back.

02:30.106 --> 02:32.239
[sniffles]

02:35.024 --> 02:36.460
You remember that?

02:36.504 --> 02:38.680
She was a free spirit.

02:40.029 --> 02:42.988
It's only been a few hours.
I already miss her so much.

02:43.032 --> 02:44.773
I do, too.

02:46.209 --> 02:49.734
You know, any time my mom left,
your mom was always there.

02:49.778 --> 02:51.127
[door opens]

02:51.171 --> 02:53.434
When you get this message,
call me when you can.

02:55.044 --> 02:57.568
She's gonna need you, Alex.

02:58.874 --> 03:00.049
[sighs]

03:00.092 --> 03:01.529
[sighs]

03:03.226 --> 03:05.315
You guys, you-you
didn't have to come.

03:05.359 --> 03:08.492
Kyle told me that Jones
is missing again.

03:08.536 --> 03:12.192
Jones is still dead.
He can wait.

03:13.236 --> 03:15.195
You and Anatsa, you...

03:15.238 --> 03:17.632
You're my sister.

03:17.675 --> 03:19.199
Of course I'm gonna
be here for you.

03:19.242 --> 03:21.070
DALLAS:
I-It's okay

03:21.113 --> 03:23.028
for you to lean
on us right now.

03:23.072 --> 03:24.508
I know right now
you feel like

03:24.552 --> 03:26.641
your heart's been
ripped out of your chest.

03:27.598 --> 03:29.513
But you have all of us

03:29.557 --> 03:32.864
and your visions.

03:32.908 --> 03:35.606
I just need a minute.

03:38.870 --> 03:40.742
[door closes]

03:40.785 --> 03:43.962
It's the "Deluca saves herself"
special in there,

03:44.006 --> 03:46.313
and I will be damned if
I sit here and do nothing,

03:46.356 --> 03:47.531
so what's going on
at Deep Sky?

03:47.575 --> 03:49.098
The cameras fritzed

03:49.141 --> 03:50.882
at the exact moment
Jones's body went missing,

03:50.926 --> 03:54.103
but nothing else is gone,
so I guess that's something.

03:54.146 --> 03:55.409
And Eduardo?

03:55.452 --> 03:56.845
I haven't connected
with him yet.

03:56.888 --> 03:58.803
Well, we're thinking
it's the third alien.

03:58.847 --> 04:01.328
I mean, it's got to be, right?
Who else would go after Jones?

04:01.371 --> 04:03.199
I'm gonna head back to the lab

04:03.243 --> 04:05.897
and figure out just
what the hell is going on.

04:05.941 --> 04:07.551
MAX:
All right.

04:07.595 --> 04:11.163
I guess, uh, Deep Sky isn't
the Fort Knox we thought it was.

04:11.990 --> 04:14.079
It's a good thing that
we didn't store this guy there.

04:14.123 --> 04:17.909
All right, well, I should
go prep my next music lesson.

04:17.953 --> 04:19.302
Bonnie's trusting me.

04:19.346 --> 04:20.651
If I can get Clyde
to do the same,

04:20.695 --> 04:22.218
I can figure out
how it all fits together.

04:22.262 --> 04:23.524
Thought you might say that,

04:23.567 --> 04:25.787
which is why Cam
brought you a tracker.

04:27.441 --> 04:29.791
No. I've seen The Departed.

04:29.834 --> 04:32.576
Hey, Michael,
listen, man.

04:32.620 --> 04:34.448
You had a big win
at the bank yesterday.

04:34.491 --> 04:36.406
Undercover work
is dangerous.

04:36.450 --> 04:38.016
All right? You can't take
your eye off the ball,

04:38.060 --> 04:39.583
even for a second.

04:39.627 --> 04:41.933
Sometimes, we let our emotions
get the best of us.

04:41.977 --> 04:45.459
I'm not letting my emotions
get the best of anything.

04:45.502 --> 04:47.156
Jones is gone.

04:47.199 --> 04:48.636
They've hit three banks now.

04:48.679 --> 04:50.115
I just want to figure out
how this is all connected

04:50.159 --> 04:51.682
before anyone else gets hurt.

04:51.726 --> 04:54.076
This is exactly why
I'm asking you to be smart.

04:55.120 --> 04:56.774
[sighs]

05:11.267 --> 05:12.616
Are we really gonna do this?

05:12.660 --> 05:14.749
Never doubt the power

05:14.792 --> 05:16.620
that can be drawn from belief.

05:17.795 --> 05:20.842
[high-pitched ringing]

05:41.906 --> 05:43.473
[sighs]

05:43.517 --> 05:45.997
Hey.
Hey.

05:46.041 --> 05:47.303
Oh.

05:47.347 --> 05:49.479
I'm still on the group text.

05:49.523 --> 05:50.480
Right.

05:50.524 --> 05:52.352
You want to sit?

05:52.395 --> 05:54.179
Drink? Cry?

05:54.223 --> 05:55.920
Oh, God help me, Anatsa.

05:55.964 --> 05:57.835
Why do you have to be
so perfect?

05:57.879 --> 06:01.056
Um, that's the complete opposite
of what you said last night.

06:01.099 --> 06:03.275
I know that.
I, uh...

06:03.319 --> 06:04.668
I wasn't really
in my right mind.

06:04.712 --> 06:06.409
Then tell me what you want.

06:06.453 --> 06:10.282
I want to...
talk to you, really.

06:10.326 --> 06:11.719
Then talk to me.

06:11.762 --> 06:13.373
I can tell
that there's something

06:13.416 --> 06:15.331
that you're trying to get out.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.115
Just take a leap of faith.

06:19.204 --> 06:21.642
I have to be with my family
right now.

06:23.078 --> 06:26.298
Um, I-I have some calls
I have to return anyway.

06:27.430 --> 06:30.433
The Albuquerque Journal
is still pressuring me

06:30.477 --> 06:32.043
about the reporter position.

06:32.087 --> 06:34.568
That's... [sniffles]

06:34.611 --> 06:36.221
You should take that job.

06:36.265 --> 06:37.962
You know,
that's, um...

06:39.094 --> 06:40.835
That's the right move
for your career.

06:48.843 --> 06:50.975
MICHAEL:
Glad you came
for another lesson.

06:51.019 --> 06:52.586
May I?

06:52.629 --> 06:55.284
Now, keep these
on the third fret.

06:55.327 --> 06:57.199
Uh-huh.

06:57.242 --> 06:58.461
[guitar strums]

06:59.593 --> 07:01.246
That is almost it.

07:01.290 --> 07:03.248
[laughs]

07:03.292 --> 07:07.470
So, I've been wondering,
why is there no music on Oasis?

07:07.514 --> 07:10.430
Well, there used to be.

07:11.909 --> 07:15.304
They say that music
pollutes the mind.

07:15.347 --> 07:16.479
They?

07:16.523 --> 07:19.569
I spent my whole life believing

07:19.613 --> 07:21.484
everything that they said.

07:21.528 --> 07:24.008
But Earth is, like,

07:24.052 --> 07:25.706
it's proof that...

07:25.749 --> 07:27.055
that things can be
different.

07:27.098 --> 07:29.057
You know, it's good
to ask questions.

07:29.100 --> 07:31.451
Helps you figure out
what you want,

07:31.494 --> 07:32.756
where you belong.

07:32.800 --> 07:35.106
Well, that often
gets me in trouble.

07:35.150 --> 07:38.762
So...
With who?
Your boyfriend?

07:38.806 --> 07:42.070
Ew, no. Clyde is-- [laughs]
He's not my boyfriend.

07:42.113 --> 07:43.637
No?
No.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.203
He's like a big brother.

07:45.247 --> 07:46.770
Oh.

07:46.814 --> 07:49.381
He was the one that...
that brought me in.

07:49.425 --> 07:51.993
Well, who brought, uh, Clyde in?

07:54.517 --> 07:56.476
I told you this poison
rots your brain.

07:56.519 --> 07:57.738
What's going on,
Bonnie?

07:57.781 --> 08:00.001
Clyde.
Mm.

08:00.044 --> 08:01.829
You know, I've been
wanting to meet you.

08:01.872 --> 08:03.221
Yeah, 'cause it's not
every day that I meet someone

08:03.265 --> 08:05.223
who knows more
about me than myself.

08:05.267 --> 08:07.312
Ah. You want answers.

08:07.356 --> 08:09.793
My whole life,

08:09.837 --> 08:11.273
it's all I've ever wanted.

08:15.320 --> 08:16.670
Hand me your phone.

08:21.588 --> 08:25.069
Now, let's go for a ride.

08:34.209 --> 08:35.297
I'm sorry,

08:35.340 --> 08:37.778
what am I
looking at here?

08:37.821 --> 08:39.693
Where did we get
all this equipment?

08:39.736 --> 08:41.825
I told Shivani I knew
about alien science.

08:41.869 --> 08:43.958
Don't worry,
that's all she knows.

08:44.001 --> 08:47.048
And no one's gonna just come
barging through that door?

08:47.091 --> 08:49.180
Shivani agreed
to a closed-door policy.

08:49.224 --> 08:51.008
All right, uh, Dr. Dyson,

08:51.052 --> 08:54.011
why don't you tell me about
this, uh, alien ectoplasm, hmm?

08:54.055 --> 08:56.579
Oh, I prefer the term "goo,"

08:56.623 --> 08:59.669
but it's technically
epidermal tissue.

08:59.713 --> 09:01.932
Mm-hmm.

09:01.976 --> 09:03.804
Okay.

09:03.847 --> 09:07.721
Third helix is present.
It's definitely alien.

09:08.635 --> 09:09.853
Hey, Liz, a second.

09:09.897 --> 09:12.856
Yeah.After everything
with Mimi,

09:12.900 --> 09:15.163
you sure you're up for this?

09:15.206 --> 09:18.383
I'm fine. I, um...

09:18.427 --> 09:20.429
can use the distraction,
actually.

09:21.604 --> 09:24.564
I sent Maria two texts, and all
I got back was a "thumbs up,"

09:24.607 --> 09:27.479
so... I must've said
something dumb.

09:28.437 --> 09:32.484
And if I can't help her,
maybe I can help us.

09:32.528 --> 09:34.095
Okay.

09:34.138 --> 09:37.577
All right,
here we go.

09:44.322 --> 09:47.674
ISOBEL:
Um, what just happened?

09:52.069 --> 09:55.246
Oh, please, please,
no more casseroles.

09:55.290 --> 09:59.990
Uh, Arturo sent 'Cosmic cakes
and Crashbrowns.

10:00.034 --> 10:01.862
I just volunteered
to deliver them.

10:01.905 --> 10:03.733
You just don't give up, do you?

10:03.777 --> 10:05.909
It's a minister's job
to offer guidance,

10:05.953 --> 10:08.259
and I think you should
talk to your friends.

10:08.303 --> 10:09.826
Look, don't you think
I know that?

10:09.870 --> 10:12.263
My life would be
so much easier if I just

10:12.307 --> 10:14.352
told Liz I lost my vision,
and then,

10:14.396 --> 10:17.747
maybe, I would have some
fighting chance at figuring out

10:17.791 --> 10:20.924
what it is my mom thought
was worth dying for.

10:20.968 --> 10:22.622
I mean, if Liz can
solve this problem,

10:22.665 --> 10:24.536
then maybe she should
drop everything to help you.

10:24.580 --> 10:26.103
No.

10:26.147 --> 10:28.628
She's working hard
at her "eat, pray, Liz" thing.

10:28.671 --> 10:29.933
Okay, what about Isobel?

10:29.977 --> 10:31.631
Or Michael?[sighs]

10:31.674 --> 10:33.371
Look, all I'm saying is
they've got dope powers, too,

10:33.415 --> 10:34.459
you know. You never know...

10:34.503 --> 10:35.939
Their powers cannot fix me.

10:35.983 --> 10:38.028
What do you know
about powers anyway?

10:38.072 --> 10:39.551
Shouldn't you be somewhere

10:39.595 --> 10:41.205
focused on your own
prepubescent abilities,

10:41.249 --> 10:42.990
instead of trying to fix
the ones that I lost?

10:44.731 --> 10:46.646
I'm sorry.

10:46.689 --> 10:48.691
Um...

10:48.735 --> 10:51.302
No, no, uh, y-you're right

10:51.346 --> 10:52.477
about some of that.

10:52.521 --> 10:53.870
No, this isn't about you.

10:53.914 --> 10:56.568
If I'd just admitted
that I was powerless,

10:56.612 --> 10:57.918
then maybe my mom
would've told me

10:57.961 --> 11:01.530
exactly what
she wanted me to know,

11:01.573 --> 11:02.705
but I just froze.

11:02.749 --> 11:04.098
Don't you dare
blame yourself

11:04.141 --> 11:05.839
for not thinking clearly
at a time like this.

11:05.882 --> 11:07.405
We will figure out

11:07.449 --> 11:10.060
whatever it is that your mom
wanted you to see.

11:10.104 --> 11:12.715
But you can't do that,
until you...

11:12.759 --> 11:15.196
until you let go of that guilt.

11:16.719 --> 11:18.155
I don't know how.

11:22.856 --> 11:25.815
Well, why don't you
ask her?

11:27.208 --> 11:30.385
I don't know. She don't seem
so powerless to me.

11:34.563 --> 11:36.391
[door creaks open]

11:39.524 --> 11:41.091
[door slams shut]

11:43.224 --> 11:45.617
Oh, pomegranate
wine coolers.

11:45.661 --> 11:46.923
Busting out the good stuff.

11:46.967 --> 11:48.359
Isn't that the customs here?

11:48.403 --> 11:50.666
Share some brewskis,
shoot the shizzel.

11:50.710 --> 11:53.103
Mm, don't think Snoop
would put it quite that way.

11:53.147 --> 11:56.672
Bonnie clearly likes you.

11:56.716 --> 11:57.847
Why is that?

11:57.891 --> 12:01.372
Uh, she appreciates my sarcasm

12:01.416 --> 12:03.331
and my on point
taste in music?

12:03.374 --> 12:05.246
Why did you bust us
out of that bank?

12:05.289 --> 12:07.814
I don't want to see you
end up in a cage.

12:08.771 --> 12:10.164
Why do you care?

12:10.207 --> 12:11.818
Met the sheriff the other day.

12:11.861 --> 12:13.384
It's pretty clear
that he feels differently.

12:13.428 --> 12:15.299
Well, if you'd done
your research,

12:15.343 --> 12:17.649
you would know that I have
a pretty impressive rap sheet.

12:17.693 --> 12:21.044
That sheriff and I have
never seen eye to eye.

12:21.088 --> 12:22.872
And you think you and I will?

12:22.916 --> 12:25.701
It's lonely being
the only one in this town

12:25.745 --> 12:27.398
who colors
outside the lines, okay?

12:28.617 --> 12:30.967
Hmm.

12:31.011 --> 12:32.708
Bonnie and I felt
like that once.

12:32.752 --> 12:34.405
Then we met someone

12:34.449 --> 12:37.887
who showed us how to be
bigger than ourselves.

12:37.931 --> 12:39.367
Jones.

12:39.410 --> 12:40.803
You knew him?

12:40.847 --> 12:42.326
Not well,

12:42.370 --> 12:44.938
but he seemed to have
it all figured out.

12:44.981 --> 12:47.244
[scoffs] He was a visionary.

12:47.288 --> 12:50.421
He showed us
what the world could be.

12:50.465 --> 12:51.858
What can the world be?

12:51.901 --> 12:54.556
[chuckles]

12:58.952 --> 13:01.345
[door opens]

13:02.433 --> 13:04.914
This is where Shivani's tech
found the alien sample.

13:04.958 --> 13:06.655
There's got
to be more.

13:06.698 --> 13:09.179
Okay, that's a cool little
magic wand you MacGyvered.Yeah.

13:09.223 --> 13:10.615
I rigged it so that
it would locate

13:10.659 --> 13:13.096
the alien tech component
in alien biology.

13:13.140 --> 13:15.359
I mean, at least
I hope I did.
Hey, hey.

13:15.403 --> 13:17.797
Can you just
slow down for a sec?

13:17.840 --> 13:19.059
What's wrong, Liz?

13:19.102 --> 13:20.538
When I ruined
that skin sample,

13:20.582 --> 13:22.323
I killed our only lead.

13:23.585 --> 13:27.154
[sighs] I-I-I-I-I haven't been
thinking clearly.

13:27.197 --> 13:30.853
Is it because of Jones,
or Maria?

13:30.897 --> 13:32.463
I don't know. I don't know.

13:32.507 --> 13:35.292
On one hand, I'm terrified
because Jones is gone,

13:35.336 --> 13:37.251
and if I don't figure out
exactly who we are up against,

13:37.294 --> 13:40.210
then there is a chance that we
have to face off with him again.

13:40.254 --> 13:41.951
And then, on
the other hand,

13:41.995 --> 13:43.474
I can't stop thinking
about Maria.

13:43.518 --> 13:45.476
I mean, she's got
to feel so alone.

13:45.520 --> 13:47.000
Max, Mimi was her world.

13:47.043 --> 13:50.699
Yesterday, you told me
to trust you.

13:50.742 --> 13:52.875
All right?
So now it's your turn.

13:52.919 --> 13:54.877
Okay? We will find
the sample,

13:54.921 --> 13:56.270
we will find Jones...[sighs]

13:56.313 --> 13:58.576
...and we will find
that third alien.

13:58.620 --> 13:59.882
Aren't you afraid?

13:59.926 --> 14:01.014
Well, of course I am,

14:01.057 --> 14:02.929
but I'm putting
all that aside

14:02.972 --> 14:06.280
because I'm putting
my faith in you.

14:07.977 --> 14:09.196
Okay.

14:10.066 --> 14:12.329
[spectrometer beeping]

14:12.373 --> 14:13.504
Oh.

14:13.548 --> 14:15.550
Something's buried here.

14:16.551 --> 14:19.989
Um, I'll have Senovative
dig it out.

14:20.033 --> 14:22.818
No, no, no. It's--
That'll take too long. I...

14:22.862 --> 14:23.993
I got this.

14:24.037 --> 14:26.169
Hey, yesterday...Was yesterday.

14:26.213 --> 14:29.172
All right? You said that,
together, we can do anything.

14:30.086 --> 14:32.001
So let's prove it.

14:34.482 --> 14:35.526
Okay.

14:38.921 --> 14:41.837
[high-pitched ringing]

14:41.881 --> 14:44.057
[ground rumbling]

14:45.449 --> 14:47.190
[straining]

15:10.910 --> 15:12.433
[whoops]

15:14.174 --> 15:17.438
You... you are
my turquoise.

15:18.700 --> 15:20.354
You focus me.

15:32.061 --> 15:33.976
[sighs] I really need
to talk to security.

15:34.020 --> 15:36.500
I am here to help you. Now,
I know that the cameras fritzed,

15:36.544 --> 15:38.763
but, uh, what else you got
on Jones' Great Escape?

15:38.807 --> 15:41.505
[chuckles]
Uh, no thanks.

15:41.549 --> 15:43.594
Not unless you're moonlighting
as a private eye.

15:43.638 --> 15:44.944
[chuckles]

15:46.032 --> 15:47.816
That was sent
to Eduardo.

15:47.859 --> 15:50.775
It was postmarked a few months
ago from a town called Careyes.

15:50.819 --> 15:52.864
Now, a quick Internet
search told me that Careyes

15:52.908 --> 15:55.128
is a town where people
put ladders up on their roofs

15:55.171 --> 15:57.434
to welcome in the Sky Gods.

15:58.305 --> 16:00.524
Who's your Sam Spade now, baby?

16:01.786 --> 16:03.963
You know, my family's
actually from Careyes.

16:04.006 --> 16:05.399
I've never been,

16:05.442 --> 16:07.009
but Eduardo says
it's nothing but a tourist trap.

16:07.053 --> 16:08.489
Oh, you mean like Roswell?

16:08.532 --> 16:11.622
It doesn't matter.
This isn't addressed to you.

16:11.666 --> 16:13.276
Wait.All's fair in love and war.

16:13.320 --> 16:16.149
[stammers] That is
a federal crime.

16:17.802 --> 16:18.934
Whoa.

16:18.978 --> 16:20.980
What?
"There are things

16:21.023 --> 16:25.027
"in Careyes
you'd find interesting.

16:25.071 --> 16:26.811
Ask for Xitlali."

16:26.855 --> 16:28.726
All right.
Let's suit up.

16:28.770 --> 16:31.512
Mm-hmm.
This symbol
has followed me around

16:31.555 --> 16:33.340
like a bad tweet my whole life.

16:33.383 --> 16:35.342
Add that to an
Aztec Sky God,

16:35.385 --> 16:37.997
I'd bet we have the place
that Jones stashed his plan B.

16:38.040 --> 16:39.476
Now, I think
we should go down there,

16:39.520 --> 16:41.739
we find the source of all this,
we make it stop,

16:41.783 --> 16:43.437
and then we drown ourselves
in mescal.

16:43.480 --> 16:47.049
You didn't come clean
to Anatsa...

16:47.093 --> 16:49.051
did you?

16:49.095 --> 16:50.966
I tried, and I couldn't,

16:51.010 --> 16:53.577
so now I'm pretty sure
that I never will be able to.

16:53.621 --> 16:55.492
[sighs]

16:56.450 --> 16:58.017
It's that pink rain, man.

16:58.060 --> 16:59.453
Ever since that pink rain,
I have not been happy.

16:59.496 --> 17:01.759
You're not alone there.

17:06.590 --> 17:08.505
Well, uh,
I saw some construction

17:08.549 --> 17:10.507
out by the highway near
Deep Sky, so I'm gonna go see

17:10.551 --> 17:13.032
if the roadside cameras
caught anything.

17:16.122 --> 17:17.427
[door opens]

17:17.471 --> 17:21.170
Hey, how about
a taste from Oasis?

17:24.782 --> 17:27.046
Or are you worried
it might be poison?

17:28.134 --> 17:29.396
[chuckles]

17:34.096 --> 17:38.057
[laughs]This tastes like every feeling
I've ever had.

17:38.100 --> 17:39.188
How do you have this?

17:39.232 --> 17:40.624
We brought it on our ship.

17:40.668 --> 17:43.105
Yeah, well, sadly,
we're in short supply,

17:43.149 --> 17:46.369
but I can show you
where it came from.

17:55.204 --> 17:58.251
[sighs]

17:59.078 --> 18:00.514
[chittering]

18:00.557 --> 18:03.430
Is that...
an Oasian salamander?

18:05.562 --> 18:07.260
Yeah, we call
them Fortune.

18:07.303 --> 18:08.913
It's good luck
if you see one.

18:08.957 --> 18:11.090
Not so much if they bite you.
Their venom is deadly.

18:11.786 --> 18:14.310
That is the tree
that bears the fruits.

18:17.008 --> 18:18.401
She's sacred.

18:18.445 --> 18:20.360
Why would you ever
leave this place?

18:20.403 --> 18:21.578
It was our Savior's will.

18:21.622 --> 18:25.147
Were you on my ship?We were.

18:25.191 --> 18:27.149
So, where have you
been all this time?

18:27.193 --> 18:28.455
In stasis

18:28.498 --> 18:31.153
till we were called upon.By Jones?

18:31.197 --> 18:32.328
Yeah.

18:32.372 --> 18:35.288
Are there more of you?

18:37.638 --> 18:39.422
Jones said our kind form triads,

18:39.466 --> 18:41.816
so there must be
a third, right?

18:41.859 --> 18:43.644
I mean, unless Jones
is your third.

18:43.687 --> 18:44.862
No.

18:45.776 --> 18:48.649
Of course not.Okay, playtime's over.

18:49.824 --> 18:52.131
Hey, my bad.

18:52.174 --> 18:53.567
I have questions.

18:53.610 --> 18:57.179
You've been to this place, man,
I haven't.

18:57.223 --> 18:58.876
'Cause you're not
asking about Oasis,

18:58.920 --> 19:00.095
you're asking about Jones.

19:00.139 --> 19:02.228
I don't care about Jones

19:02.271 --> 19:03.664
because Jones is dead, right?

19:03.707 --> 19:06.797
Okay. Why are you really here?

19:06.841 --> 19:09.104
I just told you.

19:09.148 --> 19:10.932
Oh, you're looking
for something?

19:10.975 --> 19:12.063
No.Or someone? Hey.

19:12.107 --> 19:13.326
Did someone
follow us?

19:13.369 --> 19:15.241
Clyde. You broke his phone.

19:15.284 --> 19:17.156
His clone friend's
a cop, Bonnie.

19:17.199 --> 19:18.809
Enough. You're being paranoid.

19:18.853 --> 19:21.290
If so, then he won't mind me
searching him,

19:21.334 --> 19:23.553
see if he has any secrets
up his sleeve.

19:28.471 --> 19:31.779
Your visionary? He's my father.

19:33.215 --> 19:35.304
And I'm just
like him.

19:35.348 --> 19:38.177
So, will you please tell me

19:38.220 --> 19:40.004
what my role is in all of this.

19:40.048 --> 19:42.920
We're gonna need a minute.

19:43.965 --> 19:45.445
Bonnie.

19:53.844 --> 19:55.106
Hey.

19:55.150 --> 19:57.239
Hey.
Hey.

19:57.283 --> 19:58.545
Whoa.

20:00.242 --> 20:01.591
Where did you get that?

20:03.376 --> 20:05.813
The, uh, owner of the truck
Max found.

20:05.856 --> 20:07.902
She claims she met someone
from Careyes,

20:07.945 --> 20:10.818
then woke up in it after
losing a week of her life.

20:10.861 --> 20:13.516
Great. Memory loss,
missing time.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.170
That reminds me of Noah.

20:15.214 --> 20:17.259
Yeah, mind control's kind of
what we're thinking, too.

20:17.303 --> 20:18.565
Well, and no one
has seen Eduardo

20:18.608 --> 20:20.044
since yesterday, but Isobel...

20:20.088 --> 20:25.267
She found this on the
construction crew's camera.

20:25.311 --> 20:27.313
She matches Renata's
description.

20:27.356 --> 20:30.229
I think we're looking at
our third alien.

20:42.545 --> 20:45.331
Okay. Come on, come on,
come on, come on.

20:45.374 --> 20:48.508
Got to be a phone somewhere.

20:52.120 --> 20:54.253
[man coughing]

20:54.296 --> 20:56.255
[man sighs]

20:57.952 --> 21:00.084
Michael.

21:00.128 --> 21:01.782
I'm getting you out of here.

21:02.696 --> 21:04.741
Why are your eyes blue?

21:04.785 --> 21:07.483
[stammers] I don't know.
I... All I remember

21:07.527 --> 21:09.659
is running into someone
out on the highway,

21:09.703 --> 21:12.401
and then I woke up here.
Is she here? Did you see her?

21:12.445 --> 21:13.620
Who?
The woman.

21:13.663 --> 21:16.057
You talking about
the third alien?

21:16.100 --> 21:17.537
No, but her friends are here.

21:17.580 --> 21:18.929
How did you even find me?

21:18.973 --> 21:20.757
Max let me play
Donnie Brasco.What?

21:20.801 --> 21:23.282
I know. Don't be
too impressed, though.

21:23.325 --> 21:24.979
I pushed too hard, I got made.

21:25.022 --> 21:26.589
If that's true,
then where are they?

21:26.633 --> 21:28.591
They're outside
planning my untimely end.

21:28.635 --> 21:32.291
I sort of blurted out
that I'm Jones's son.

21:32.334 --> 21:33.944
I jumped the gun.

21:33.988 --> 21:35.946
You did exactly
what you should've.

21:35.990 --> 21:38.384
If they were going to kill you,
they would've done it by now.

21:38.427 --> 21:40.124
Clyde isn't exactly
an open book.

21:40.168 --> 21:41.430
No good criminal is.

21:41.474 --> 21:44.868
Undercover work
is like... poker.

21:44.912 --> 21:46.392
You never know exactly
what they're thinking,

21:46.435 --> 21:49.133
but one thing's for sure,
if you run,

21:49.177 --> 21:50.831
they've called your bluff.

21:53.007 --> 21:54.617
[sighs]

21:56.053 --> 21:59.318
Let me ask you this,
do you think they're all bad?

22:01.668 --> 22:03.539
No, I think some of them
are just lost.

22:03.583 --> 22:06.150
This isn't my first kidnapping.

22:06.194 --> 22:07.935
I can escape on my own.

22:09.371 --> 22:11.330
Don't give up.

22:26.345 --> 22:28.521
MIMI:
Hey.

22:28.564 --> 22:30.044
It's Teen Witchtonight,

22:30.087 --> 22:32.916
if I can fix this spool
before curtain.

22:32.960 --> 22:34.004
Sounds stupid.

22:34.048 --> 22:35.963
Teen Witchis a cult classic.

22:36.006 --> 22:38.400
I think you and Ty
would really enjoy it.

22:38.444 --> 22:40.446
Yeah, well,
I'm gonna have to pass

22:40.489 --> 22:43.318
because Ty just dumped me

22:43.362 --> 22:44.450
for Lindsay Lewis.

22:44.493 --> 22:46.060
No.

22:48.671 --> 22:51.979
Did I ever told you why
I volunteer my time

22:52.022 --> 22:55.069
tinkering with this
old projector?

22:55.112 --> 22:56.375
Free movie tickets.

22:56.418 --> 22:59.203
Film captures the soul.

22:59.247 --> 23:00.988
A good movie can

23:01.031 --> 23:03.033
change the whole way
you see the world.

23:03.077 --> 23:05.296
You know, I don't think
that Teen Witch

23:05.340 --> 23:08.125
is gonna change the way
I see Ty and Lindsey.

23:08.169 --> 23:09.736
Give me your hand.

23:09.779 --> 23:11.172
Hmm...

23:11.215 --> 23:13.609
See here?

23:13.653 --> 23:16.699
This is the intersection
of your love and life lines,

23:16.743 --> 23:20.442
and it says you have
quite a few more years

23:20.486 --> 23:24.403
before you walk down the aisle
with Mr. Right. Sorry.

23:24.446 --> 23:26.492
That supposed to
make me feel better?

23:26.535 --> 23:28.842
You're in high school.

23:28.885 --> 23:30.539
Nothing's supposed to
make you feel better.

23:30.583 --> 23:32.541
Except maybe

23:32.585 --> 23:35.239
seeing Teen Witchtonight
with your mom.

23:35.283 --> 23:37.416
[sighs]

23:37.459 --> 23:38.460
Fine.

23:38.504 --> 23:40.941
[chuckles]

23:45.598 --> 23:47.948
Love and life lines?

23:48.949 --> 23:51.952
She wants me to go
to her wedding.

23:53.954 --> 23:55.216
Oh, wait.

23:55.259 --> 23:56.739
Eduardo was mind-controlled?

23:56.783 --> 23:58.567
Yeah, we think he's the one
that stole Jones's body.

23:58.611 --> 24:00.569
Oh, my God. Is he okay?

24:00.613 --> 24:01.962
Well, he's still missing.

24:02.005 --> 24:03.746
But the good news is
that Kyle and Isobel

24:03.790 --> 24:04.921
found a photo of
our third alien.

24:04.965 --> 24:06.923
We think
they're together, so...

24:06.967 --> 24:08.490
Cam and I are gonna
start looking

24:08.534 --> 24:09.578
where Michael's tracker
last pinged.

24:09.622 --> 24:11.101
Oh, okay, well...

24:11.145 --> 24:13.843
Wait, if you don't need Kyle,
can I borrow him?

24:13.887 --> 24:16.759
I could use his help sniffing
out some more alien DNA samples.

24:16.803 --> 24:19.196
MAX:
Well, I wish I could
loan him to you,

24:19.240 --> 24:21.590
but he went down to
Mexico, following a lead.

24:21.634 --> 24:23.070
You should probably hop out.

24:23.113 --> 24:24.463
We got to release this truck
back to its...

24:24.506 --> 24:26.116
What are you doing in my rig?

24:26.160 --> 24:27.378
...owner.

24:27.422 --> 24:28.771
Uh, my colleague was just

24:28.815 --> 24:31.557
finishing up
her sweep of your cab.

24:32.601 --> 24:34.777
How long have you had blue eyes?

24:35.648 --> 24:36.823
Since I blacked out
and found myself

24:36.866 --> 24:38.477
in someone else's clothes.

24:38.520 --> 24:40.174
Worst part is,

24:40.217 --> 24:43.177
now my Van Morrison tattoo
doesn't make any sense.

24:51.533 --> 24:54.971
I am not mounting a national
search party to find an alien.

24:55.015 --> 24:57.626
What are you
doing here anyway?

24:57.670 --> 24:59.802
You know, last I checked,
I'm still the only

24:59.846 --> 25:01.891
legallyblonde gunslinger
in town.

25:01.935 --> 25:03.284
You ever wonder
if maybe gunslingers

25:03.327 --> 25:04.938
aren't really as tough
as they look?

25:04.981 --> 25:06.722
You know, I mean, it's
easy to romanticize

25:06.766 --> 25:09.159
being out there at dawn with
nothing but a quick hand

25:09.203 --> 25:10.509
and steel bullets, you know,

25:10.552 --> 25:11.988
but holistically speaking,
I mean,

25:12.032 --> 25:13.642
don't you think a lot of them
probably had

25:13.686 --> 25:15.296
some pretty intense
psychological issues?

25:15.339 --> 25:16.689
Is this a trick question?

25:16.732 --> 25:18.386
No, I'm just, you
know, I'm just saying.

25:18.429 --> 25:20.170
It's-it's easy to know what
to do when you're playing

25:20.214 --> 25:21.563
The Quick and the Dead
with an evil overlord,

25:21.607 --> 25:22.999
you know,
but when it comes to how

25:23.043 --> 25:24.566
we treat people that we love,
it's just...

25:24.610 --> 25:26.960
This is about Maria.

25:27.003 --> 25:29.484
Yeah, I guess, um, everything
that happened with Mimi,

25:29.528 --> 25:31.268
it just made me realize how...

25:31.312 --> 25:34.010
how easy it is to lose someone
that you love.

25:34.054 --> 25:35.664
Just because Max is proposing

25:35.708 --> 25:37.710
does not mean
you're gonna lose him.

25:39.363 --> 25:41.670
You... you didn't know?

25:41.714 --> 25:42.715
No, I did not.

25:42.758 --> 25:44.325
Doesn't matter.

25:44.368 --> 25:46.370
Max and Liz decided to wait.

25:46.414 --> 25:50.505
So-so my brother found the balls
to get down on one knee

25:50.549 --> 25:52.202
and meanwhile, I,

25:52.246 --> 25:54.727
for some inexplicable reason,
lose all nerve

25:54.770 --> 25:57.599
when it comes
to telling my own truth?

25:58.469 --> 25:59.688
You're in love.

25:59.732 --> 26:02.212
It's horrible, Cameron.

26:02.256 --> 26:03.953
And instead of cherishing
my beautiful girlfriend,

26:03.997 --> 26:06.869
I just told her to move
halfway across the state.

26:06.913 --> 26:10.569
I have been horrible
to her all week,

26:10.612 --> 26:12.222
and I can't stop
because she is a reporter

26:12.266 --> 26:13.746
who is chasing a story,
you know?

26:13.789 --> 26:15.356
And if she knew the truth
about me, then...

26:15.399 --> 26:20.100
She might just expose your
alien pedigree to the world?

26:21.928 --> 26:23.799
You really think she'd do that?

26:27.673 --> 26:28.761
No.

26:28.804 --> 26:33.330
Sounds to me like Anatsa

26:33.374 --> 26:36.072
is the first person
you've really cared about

26:36.116 --> 26:37.291
since your ex.

26:37.334 --> 26:38.988
My guess is,

26:39.032 --> 26:42.296
you're afraid that if you open
your heart to her,

26:42.339 --> 26:44.080
she might shatter it.

26:44.124 --> 26:45.865
All right.

26:45.908 --> 26:49.129
You got me, Annie Oakley.

26:51.653 --> 26:53.612
Must be nice being bulletproof.

26:53.655 --> 26:57.659
Beneath this
gunslinger bravado

26:57.703 --> 27:01.271
was a young, stupid deputy

27:01.315 --> 27:04.623
in love
with your stupid brother.

27:04.666 --> 27:06.886
But I never found
the courage to tell him.

27:06.929 --> 27:08.888
Sometimes I still wonder,
if I had,

27:08.931 --> 27:11.673
if things would be
different, but...

27:13.501 --> 27:15.982
Yeah, well, that's over now.

27:16.025 --> 27:17.897
Oh, Cam.

27:19.681 --> 27:21.074
I had no idea.

27:21.117 --> 27:24.077
That's kind of the point
of the story.

27:34.522 --> 27:35.958
What are you doing here?

27:37.786 --> 27:39.092
You can't leave yet.

27:39.135 --> 27:41.137
I have something
that I need to say.

27:41.181 --> 27:43.531
You've been needing to say
something for a week now.

27:43.574 --> 27:44.793
I know.

27:44.837 --> 27:47.753
But I was scared
how you would react.

27:47.796 --> 27:49.363
And you're not scared anymore?

27:49.406 --> 27:52.235
No. I'm terrified.

27:53.149 --> 27:55.064
But I need you to
know the real me.

27:55.108 --> 27:58.981
I'm sorry that I lied to you

27:59.025 --> 28:01.680
about Max and Cameron
working together.

28:03.029 --> 28:05.248
But most of all, I am sorry

28:05.292 --> 28:07.903
for any time that I have
pushed you away,

28:07.947 --> 28:10.819
because all I want is
to be close to you.

28:10.863 --> 28:16.042
Anatsa, you are... perfect.

28:17.130 --> 28:20.437
And I am completely
in love with you.

28:23.745 --> 28:27.140
There is a cave that is a mile
and a half away from here,

28:27.183 --> 28:29.055
and I know this
sounds creepy,

28:29.098 --> 28:31.318
but I need you to come with me
because it's gonna help me

28:31.361 --> 28:32.798
explain who I really am.

28:32.841 --> 28:36.105
So, what do you
say, cowgirl? Hmm?

28:37.411 --> 28:40.066
Will you ride off
into the sunset with me?

28:43.852 --> 28:45.549
This...
[laughs softly]

28:45.593 --> 28:48.378
...roller coaster that we're on,

28:48.422 --> 28:50.293
it's been more
than I can handle.

28:51.773 --> 28:53.949
My heart is broken, Isobel.

28:53.993 --> 28:56.865
It's not that I don't love you,
it's just...

28:56.909 --> 29:00.216
for me, love can't be
this complicated.

29:00.260 --> 29:01.914
[exhales]

29:04.003 --> 29:05.526
I hope you figure this out.

29:07.006 --> 29:08.747
'Cause you deserve to be happy.

29:08.790 --> 29:10.749
[sniffles]

29:12.446 --> 29:14.491
[Isobel crying softly]

29:29.811 --> 29:32.074
Had a little trouble
finding your outhouse.

29:32.118 --> 29:34.990
You should consider plumbing.

29:35.034 --> 29:37.166
It's a prize of the modern age.

29:37.210 --> 29:41.170
I heard stories about
the Engineer and the Savior,

29:41.214 --> 29:43.999
I just never imagined
they had a child.

29:44.043 --> 29:46.959
Never imagined
I was heir to a throne.

29:47.002 --> 29:51.659
What do you say we put
our, um, skepticism aside?

29:51.702 --> 29:53.748
You're his son,

29:53.792 --> 29:55.315
I'm his star pupil.

29:55.358 --> 29:57.970
I bet there's a lot
we can learn from each other.

30:01.582 --> 30:02.888
That's what I'm here for.

30:09.198 --> 30:10.721
MICHAEL:That's from
Las Cruces Bank.

30:10.765 --> 30:12.245
Open it.

30:12.288 --> 30:14.160
[high-pitched ringing]

30:15.857 --> 30:17.772
MICHAEL:
What are they for?

30:17.816 --> 30:20.296
They are pieces of
a larger puzzle.

30:34.267 --> 30:36.747
All that's missing is that piece
from West Pecos Bank and Trust.

30:36.791 --> 30:38.793
Yeah, and when
you retrieve it,

30:38.837 --> 30:40.664
you'll be able to see
what this skilled piece

30:40.708 --> 30:42.101
of engineering can do.

30:43.319 --> 30:45.582
Rumor has it
your mother built it.

30:49.456 --> 30:51.501
â™ª

30:54.809 --> 30:57.333
Been here three hours
and no one knows Xitlali.

30:57.377 --> 30:59.292
Not even at my family's
tequila distillery.

30:59.335 --> 31:01.816
How did that trucker
volunteer her eye DNA?

31:01.860 --> 31:03.731
I sort of made her cry
and then I asked for a Kleenex.

31:03.774 --> 31:05.515
Wow, that bedside manner.

31:05.559 --> 31:08.127
I just, I have to figure out
what changed Renata's eye color

31:08.170 --> 31:10.129
and the last time
that I touched alien DNA,

31:10.172 --> 31:12.261
it literally turned to dust.

31:12.305 --> 31:14.873
So I need my old partner
to help me.

31:14.916 --> 31:16.004
What does the science say?

31:16.048 --> 31:17.397
It's definitely alien.

31:17.440 --> 31:18.789
I mean, whatever happened
left trace DNA

31:18.833 --> 31:20.226
in Renata's system.

31:20.269 --> 31:21.880
And there was no exchange
of genetic material

31:21.923 --> 31:24.143
when Sheriff Taylor or Isobel
were mind-controlled.

31:24.186 --> 31:25.971
Maybe our alien carries
a mutated gene

31:26.014 --> 31:28.887
that makes her more,
um... evolved.

31:28.930 --> 31:30.279
Or maybe involved.

31:30.323 --> 31:33.065
Uh, w-what if the DNA
acts as an anchor,

31:33.108 --> 31:34.240
you know, in the way
that the handprint does,

31:34.283 --> 31:35.719
so that it could give her

31:35.763 --> 31:36.982
better control of her victims?

31:37.025 --> 31:38.157
Add the dye.

31:38.200 --> 31:39.549
It might give you a better idea

31:39.593 --> 31:40.899
of its molecular composition.Kyle,

31:40.942 --> 31:42.378
the last time I altered it...

31:42.422 --> 31:43.727
You've been doing this
since seventh grade, Liz.

31:43.771 --> 31:44.946
Okay? You can't screw it up.

31:44.990 --> 31:46.426
I got to go.
[clears throat]

32:04.357 --> 32:05.575
Okay.

32:15.803 --> 32:19.328
No. No, no, no.
Oh, I lost another sample.

32:19.372 --> 32:21.461
[sighs]

32:21.504 --> 32:24.464
I got nothing but, uh,
roadkill and tumbleweeds.

32:24.507 --> 32:26.248
What about you?CAMERON: No dice.

32:26.292 --> 32:27.989
Combed a three-mile radius
from our last hit

32:28.033 --> 32:29.773
on Michael's tracker.

32:29.817 --> 32:31.079
Think it's faulty?

32:31.123 --> 32:33.429
Round of shots
says he smashed it.

32:33.473 --> 32:35.649
[sighs] Well, you better be
talking doubles,

32:35.692 --> 32:38.739
'cause I could use a buzz
after today.

32:38.782 --> 32:40.306
Oh, you want a buzz?

32:40.349 --> 32:44.223
Liz told me to watch out
for an Eduardo with blue eyes.

32:44.266 --> 32:45.964
She thinks it's the way
the third alien

32:46.007 --> 32:47.748
mind-controlled her victims.

32:47.791 --> 32:50.229
I'm telling you, man,
"freaky" is part of the job.

32:52.274 --> 32:55.103
I've got Eduardo.
Get here quick.

32:56.191 --> 32:59.194
I'm okay. I'm okay.

32:59.238 --> 33:01.066
I'm just a little light-headed.

33:01.109 --> 33:03.764
Thirsty.Yeah.

33:06.288 --> 33:08.029
Your eyes are brown.

33:11.250 --> 33:13.904
And since when do you
have an alien tattoo?

33:13.948 --> 33:17.256
That's because
I'm not Eduardo.

33:23.610 --> 33:25.003
[knocking on door]

33:25.046 --> 33:26.308
If it's a fidget toy you need,

33:26.352 --> 33:29.181
I've invented
plenty better than those.

33:30.530 --> 33:33.620
For the first time in forever,

33:33.663 --> 33:35.448
the science doesn't make
any sense to me.

33:35.491 --> 33:39.278
Well, the world has a way
of clouding our judgment

33:39.321 --> 33:40.888
when we need it the most.

33:40.931 --> 33:42.716
[sighs]

33:42.759 --> 33:44.544
Something happen today?

33:44.587 --> 33:46.024
I lost someone.

33:46.067 --> 33:48.026
Oh.

33:48.069 --> 33:50.332
Come here.

33:50.376 --> 33:55.511
Someone that was always
there for my sister and me.

33:55.555 --> 34:00.821
I mean, she made sure we had
warm clothes in the winter

34:00.864 --> 34:05.739
and she was the shoulder
to cry on when things got tough.

34:05.782 --> 34:10.700
You know, when my daughter
went through her sickness,

34:10.744 --> 34:13.877
I struggled for months
to see through the pain.

34:13.921 --> 34:19.057
You know, all day, I have been
refusing to let the pain win.

34:20.101 --> 34:22.364
I think it still won.

34:22.408 --> 34:24.192
Because you're not
acknowledging it.

34:24.236 --> 34:26.542
You give yourself
permission to grieve,

34:26.586 --> 34:28.588
and you will find
your footing again.

34:30.198 --> 34:31.721
It's hard to lose a mother.

34:31.765 --> 34:34.550
I mean, she wasn't
actually my mother.

34:34.594 --> 34:37.205
Sounds like she really was.

34:37.249 --> 34:39.425
In all the ways that matter.

34:45.605 --> 34:48.086
Hey, can I tell you a secret?

34:48.129 --> 34:50.088
[sniffles]
Yeah.

34:50.131 --> 34:52.220
This isn't the end.

34:52.264 --> 34:53.830
[exhales]

34:53.874 --> 34:55.963
I think life is like water.

34:56.006 --> 34:59.097
Takes many forms.

34:59.140 --> 35:02.926
Liquid, gas, ice cubes.

35:02.970 --> 35:05.277
But at its essence,

35:05.320 --> 35:08.454
it always remains the same.

35:09.890 --> 35:12.240
You will see her again.

35:20.205 --> 35:22.511
BONNIE: So, he
showed it to you.

35:22.555 --> 35:24.383
[sighs]

35:24.426 --> 35:28.300
The way the pieces
interact with the board...

35:28.343 --> 35:30.606
Of course my mom built it.

35:31.868 --> 35:33.174
She did, right?

35:33.218 --> 35:35.045
There's a lot they
haven't shared,

35:35.089 --> 35:36.743
but I do know this:

35:36.786 --> 35:38.527
Clyde is more than
what he showed you.

35:38.571 --> 35:41.617
Outside paradise
is a planet on fire.

35:41.661 --> 35:42.836
Jones told me.

35:43.663 --> 35:46.535
I remember
when they recruited me.

35:46.579 --> 35:48.972
Clyde told me everything
I wanted to hear.

35:50.104 --> 35:52.889
But what he's offering you
is not without expectations.

35:52.933 --> 35:54.500
You're afraid of him.

35:55.936 --> 35:58.634
Some days he's my rock.

35:58.678 --> 36:02.290
The next, he's a completely
different person.

36:03.204 --> 36:05.337
I'm here now.

36:05.380 --> 36:07.208
I will protect you.

36:08.470 --> 36:11.256
I don't know that you can.

36:11.299 --> 36:13.388
But I love that you'd be
willing to try.

36:15.912 --> 36:18.219
Mm-- Wow. Hey.

36:18.263 --> 36:20.090
Okay, wow.

36:20.134 --> 36:21.744
Oh, Bonnie.

36:21.788 --> 36:24.182
I am so sorry,
but I have a boyfriend.

36:24.225 --> 36:27.228
And I'm kind of completely
in love with him.

36:27.272 --> 36:28.447
Shih tzu.

36:28.490 --> 36:30.753
I'm-I'm so sorry.No, that's okay.

36:30.797 --> 36:33.103
God, I'm-I'm still getting
used to Earth customs.

36:33.147 --> 36:34.540
Me, too.

36:35.454 --> 36:37.020
Well, he's a lucky guy.

36:37.064 --> 36:38.674
[exhales]

36:40.633 --> 36:41.764
Bonnie.

36:43.636 --> 36:45.377
Just tell me what it's for?

36:46.291 --> 36:48.249
I'm told it's to take us home.

36:58.390 --> 37:01.044
[high-pitched ringing]

37:01.088 --> 37:03.308
[metal creaking]

37:09.139 --> 37:12.578
YOUNG DALLAS:
Dad, Dad, you dropped
your necklace.

37:21.587 --> 37:23.328
All right, Mom,
why are you pointing me

37:23.371 --> 37:25.025
towards your wedding?

37:28.376 --> 37:30.596
I love you, Mom.

37:32.641 --> 37:35.818
I promise, I'm gonna find
whatever you want me to see.

37:46.307 --> 37:48.918
Why'd you want me
to find a tree?

37:57.623 --> 37:58.841
[grunts]

38:00.321 --> 38:02.671
Cam. Are you shot?

38:02.715 --> 38:03.629
Eduardo.

38:03.672 --> 38:05.761
H-He wasn't, he wasn't himself.

38:05.805 --> 38:08.677
I-I drew on him, but he got it
away from me. [groans]

38:10.244 --> 38:11.985
Oh, yeah, that's bad.
We got to get you to an ER.

38:12.028 --> 38:15.423
No, there isn't time.
You got to heal me.

38:16.511 --> 38:18.078
We can't let him get away, Max.

38:18.121 --> 38:19.297
I-I don't know if...

38:19.340 --> 38:20.385
Max, you can do it.

38:20.428 --> 38:21.647
Okay? Just breathe.

38:21.690 --> 38:23.301
Okay.You can do it.

38:23.344 --> 38:24.954
You can do it.

38:24.998 --> 38:26.652
Breathe.

38:30.743 --> 38:32.658
[high-pitched ringing]

38:32.701 --> 38:33.920
[grunts]

38:35.269 --> 38:37.967
[groans]

38:39.491 --> 38:40.927
[both panting]

38:42.668 --> 38:44.278
You don't know
your own strength.

38:44.322 --> 38:46.149
[both chuckle]Come on.

38:46.193 --> 38:48.326
He took off down the highway.

39:01.251 --> 39:03.036
â™ª

39:05.125 --> 39:07.432
Signs of a struggle.

39:19.966 --> 39:21.663
[phone ringing]

39:21.707 --> 39:22.882
[clears throat]

39:22.925 --> 39:24.274
LIZ [over phone]:
Kyle. What if

39:24.318 --> 39:25.624
the alien cells aren't dead?

39:25.667 --> 39:27.060
What if
they are only playing dead?

39:27.103 --> 39:28.409
Like an octopus does
when it-it's scared

39:28.453 --> 39:29.628
and it turns into coral.

39:29.671 --> 39:31.194
You're talking chromatophores.

39:31.238 --> 39:33.066
If this alien has
a fight-or-flight response

39:33.109 --> 39:34.415
at the molecular level,

39:34.459 --> 39:36.199
just think about
what that could mean.

39:36.243 --> 39:38.419
Yeah, but how would you even
test for that?

39:39.333 --> 39:40.465
Are you gonna scare it?

39:40.508 --> 39:42.118
No, I'm going to introduce

39:42.162 --> 39:44.991
Renata Arellano's tears
to the alien dust and see

39:45.034 --> 39:47.907
if I can persuade it
to turn back into tissue.

39:55.784 --> 39:57.438
Oh, my God, I'm right.

39:57.482 --> 39:59.527
If all her cells can do this...

39:59.571 --> 40:01.616
I need to call Max.

40:01.660 --> 40:04.097
â™ª It's like waking up

40:04.140 --> 40:06.404
â™ª To a mad world

40:08.275 --> 40:09.624
â™ª Where the Earth

40:09.668 --> 40:12.235
â™ª Is spinning backwards

40:12.279 --> 40:15.500
â™ª You're just living
for the thrill... â™ª

40:15.543 --> 40:17.763
What the hell are they doing
with his body?

40:17.806 --> 40:19.460
â™ª Running circles
in your pretty little mind... â™ª

40:19.504 --> 40:21.331
Do you think they're
trying to resurrect him?

40:21.375 --> 40:22.898
I don't know.

40:22.942 --> 40:24.944
You think they have
that kind of power?

40:26.032 --> 40:27.642
â™ª Are you really living...

40:27.686 --> 40:29.731
I mean, how much
do you know about them?

40:29.775 --> 40:31.429
Not as much as I'd like.

40:32.517 --> 40:35.824
â™ª In the game of survival

40:35.868 --> 40:39.480
â™ª Secrets run for miles...

40:39.524 --> 40:42.875
How did Liz sever
the connection, anyway?

40:44.180 --> 40:47.053
She must be pretty damn good
to defeat a god.

40:47.096 --> 40:48.620
She is.

40:48.663 --> 40:50.578
â™ª Everyone's a rival

40:50.622 --> 40:52.798
â™ª There's nowhere to hide

40:52.841 --> 40:56.976
â™ª 'Cause the darkness
is pulling you under... â™ª

40:57.019 --> 41:00.370
How are you in two places
at once?

41:00.414 --> 41:03.069
Hey, Cam, I know this is gonna
sound a little creepy,

41:03.112 --> 41:06.289
but I tracked your location
on Snapchat, I've...

41:06.333 --> 41:09.162
I've had a hell of a night,
and I... Oh, my God, Cam.

41:09.205 --> 41:10.642
Cam, what...?

41:10.685 --> 41:12.470
Cam? Cam.

41:12.513 --> 41:14.515
Hey, are you okay?Where's Evans?

41:14.559 --> 41:15.821
Okay, I don't know, I just...

41:17.562 --> 41:19.607
Have you always had blue eyes?

41:24.003 --> 41:27.180
How, uh, how long
you had that tattoo?

41:34.535 --> 41:38.147
â™ª In the game of survival...

41:38.191 --> 41:39.801
You're not Cam, are you?

41:39.845 --> 41:42.630
â™ª In the game of survival

41:42.674 --> 41:44.850
â™ª It's a game of survival...

41:44.893 --> 41:46.155
I'm not.

41:46.199 --> 41:48.462
â™ª Of survival...

41:48.506 --> 41:52.248
Call me Tezca.

41:54.903 --> 41:57.906
â™ª It's a game of survival.
