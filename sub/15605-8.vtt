00:09.040 --> 00:11.600
(narrator)
'Ex On The Beach is back.'

00:12.440 --> 00:14.760
'This time it's all stars.'

00:14.840 --> 00:18.920
'Old faces return
for another shot at finding love.'

00:19.000 --> 00:20.800
Am I looking for love? Yeah.

00:20.880 --> 00:23.000
'They'll have to endure their exes.'

00:24.040 --> 00:26.720
I've never, ever
felt like this in my life.

00:26.800 --> 00:29.320
'Some will have to deal
with old grudges.'

00:30.560 --> 00:33.200
You've had more dicks
than I've had sun beds.

00:33.280 --> 00:36.600
'And as hard as they try
to find their perfect match...'

00:36.680 --> 00:38.720
Right, who wants to finger me?

00:38.800 --> 00:42.240
'...standing in their way again
will be the Tablet of Terror.'

00:43.280 --> 00:45.640
I won't lie,
I'm cacking myself big time.

00:45.720 --> 00:48.800
'It's going to be hotter
than ever before...'

00:48.880 --> 00:50.920
I wanna ride her. Giddy up, Aimee.

00:51.000 --> 00:53.000
'...as emotions boil over.'

00:53.080 --> 00:57.040
You made me realise that there's
more to life than what I was doing.

00:57.120 --> 00:58.760
'Tensions run high.'

00:58.840 --> 01:00.640
Dare you. I fucking dare you.

01:00.720 --> 01:02.080
Let's fucking go, kid.

01:02.160 --> 01:03.880
'And the claws come out.'

01:03.960 --> 01:05.280
...to your face.

01:07.560 --> 01:10.240
'So far, nine exes have arrived.'

01:10.880 --> 01:11.920
'Whose...

01:12.000 --> 01:14.600
She is the most toxic person
I have ever met.

01:14.680 --> 01:16.240
'...ex...'

01:16.320 --> 01:17.600
'...is...'

01:18.480 --> 01:19.560
...next?'

01:19.640 --> 01:22.760
I did not think
that I was gonna feel like this.

01:24.000 --> 01:30.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:37.680 --> 01:39.360
It's Alex.

01:39.440 --> 01:42.240
OK?
I just literally love you so much.

01:42.320 --> 01:44.400
I'd be fucked
if she was into some lad.

01:44.480 --> 01:47.200
What have you been up to?
I've not slept with anyone.

01:47.280 --> 01:50.800
I would like to trust Charlotte.
I don't wanna throw away six years.

01:50.880 --> 01:54.200
I can't really bring myself to tell
Alex what I've been up to.

01:55.640 --> 01:58.000
I've never met anyone
like you before.

01:58.080 --> 02:00.560
But I get bored very easily.

02:00.640 --> 02:03.120
I want Chrysten.
I can't do that to Lillie,

02:03.200 --> 02:05.400
but I would love to fuck her
brains out.

02:05.480 --> 02:08.479
I came here to get with Holly.
I do actually like the girl.

02:08.560 --> 02:11.880
I'm not gonna go with anybody else.
I'll spend my time with you.

02:15.840 --> 02:19.560
I don't wanna be associated when
she's running with her minge out.

02:19.640 --> 02:20.640
It's disgusting.

02:20.720 --> 02:21.800
Shall I bang you?

02:21.880 --> 02:24.360
Give us some fucking action, man.

02:24.800 --> 02:27.080
Jemma knows
I have feelings for Ashley.

02:27.160 --> 02:29.000
I walk in to you fucking Ashley.

02:29.080 --> 02:33.720
STI'd fucking slut,
you dare fucking touch me.

02:38.440 --> 02:42.880
I'm pissed off with Ash
because he massively mugged me off,

02:42.960 --> 02:45.280
so I'm ecstatic Jemma's gone.

02:49.880 --> 02:52.360
I would like to sort stuff out
with Charlotte.

02:52.440 --> 02:55.360
We were together for a long time.
There's history,

02:55.440 --> 02:57.240
but it's just a trust thing

02:57.320 --> 02:59.880
I want her to tell me
everything she's been up to

02:59.960 --> 03:02.680
because I'm looking like a mug
acting happy with her

03:02.760 --> 03:05.120
when I don't know the shit
she's been up to.

03:05.200 --> 03:09.200
I've got to tell Alex
that I gave Bear a blowy,

03:09.280 --> 03:11.960
had a three-way kiss
with Gaz and Olivia

03:12.040 --> 03:14.320
and Jordan went down on me.

03:14.400 --> 03:16.880
I feel like I've got
a black cloud over me.

03:16.960 --> 03:21.240
He is, like, the love of my life.
I'm sweating cos I'm scared.

03:25.640 --> 03:28.760
I'm not sure if I trust Bear.
I've only known him a few days.

03:28.840 --> 03:32.440
But right now my instinct is just
telling me to trust Bear

03:32.520 --> 03:34.280
until he does something wrong.

03:34.360 --> 03:37.520
I got a little poem
for the situation I'm in.

03:37.600 --> 03:40.680
Lillie, let me give you my willy

03:40.760 --> 03:44.800
and if it doesn't happen soon,
Bear might get silly.

03:44.880 --> 03:46.480
Morning, pussy cat.

03:46.560 --> 03:50.160
Naughty Bear, naughty.
Everyone's gonna hate you,

03:50.240 --> 03:53.880
but I don't care anymore
because I need to look after myself.

03:55.760 --> 04:00.160
O-M-G. Bear's been flirting with me
and I'm really attracted to him.

04:00.240 --> 04:03.720
Lillie has first grabs. I don't
wanna steal another boyfriend,

04:03.800 --> 04:05.160
but he is hot.

04:08.600 --> 04:11.320
Did you kiss anyone last night,
Holly?

04:11.400 --> 04:14.400
Do you remember who you kissed
in the bedroom?

04:16.120 --> 04:18.200
(gasps)
(laughter)

04:20.160 --> 04:22.840
Hawley did you snog Holly
in the room last night?

04:25.080 --> 04:27.120
(others laugh)

04:27.200 --> 04:29.160
Oh, my God.

04:29.240 --> 04:31.120
(laughs)
Are you being serious?

04:33.120 --> 04:36.040
When you were kicking off,
you necked on with us.

04:36.120 --> 04:38.200
What, I did to you?

04:38.280 --> 04:41.960
Then you stick it on him
and he pushed you away (laughs).

04:42.040 --> 04:43.160
No, I didn't.

04:43.240 --> 04:45.800
We promised we weren't
gonna get with anyone.

04:45.880 --> 04:47.840
What the fuck is Holly doing?

04:47.920 --> 04:49.800
Conor, how do you feel about that?

04:49.880 --> 04:52.400
I'm happy, mate.
I can't stand her anymore.

04:52.480 --> 04:54.840
Oh! (laughs)

04:54.920 --> 04:57.600
I don't believe that.
I think she's a tramp.

04:57.680 --> 04:59.280
(gasps)

05:00.360 --> 05:01.680
Oh, my God.

05:01.760 --> 05:04.400
Oh, my God,
I don't believe that I did that.

05:04.480 --> 05:08.440
It was going really well with Conor
and now I've proper fucked it.

05:09.200 --> 05:10.240
You did.

05:11.880 --> 05:13.400
That was boring. Fuck off.

05:13.480 --> 05:15.280
You're a little tramp.

05:15.360 --> 05:18.520
Why did no one tell me that
before breakfast?

05:18.600 --> 05:20.840
I don't know what to do.

05:20.920 --> 05:23.320
I was drunk and I said to him

05:23.400 --> 05:26.600
it was just, it was, like,
I didn't even know I did it.

05:26.680 --> 05:28.040
Why didn't Conor tell me?

05:28.120 --> 05:30.280
I asked him.
I don't think Conor knew.

05:30.360 --> 05:34.280
I was like, to Conor, "Can you
promise you won't get with anyone?"

05:35.080 --> 05:38.640
And now I've done it
and I just feel really out of order.

05:42.600 --> 05:44.960
'With the relationships on thin ice,

05:45.040 --> 05:47.640
the Tablet of Terror is playing
cupid for once

05:47.720 --> 05:51.880
and has sent Ashley and Kayleigh
on a flower arranging date.'

05:54.560 --> 05:57.240
What's going on?
Are you gonna sulk the whole time?

05:58.400 --> 05:59.760
I'm not sulking.

05:59.840 --> 06:01.640
I'm feeling very nervous

06:01.720 --> 06:04.880
because I don't really express
my true feelings to Ashley.

06:04.960 --> 06:06.240
I never thought I would.

06:06.320 --> 06:09.280
You came into the villa
as my ex, yeah?

06:09.360 --> 06:12.600
The first night you had a threesome
with two girls

06:12.680 --> 06:14.760
that's already had sex in the villa.

06:15.880 --> 06:18.440
We've always had respect
for each other,

06:18.520 --> 06:21.800
whereas the second he walked in,
I felt all of that was lost.

06:21.880 --> 06:23.920
No, I did what I did
on the first night

06:24.000 --> 06:26.480
because I'm me
and I do do some stupid things.

06:26.560 --> 06:28.800
To be honest,
I can kind of see her point.

06:28.880 --> 06:30.400
It's obvious I care for you.

06:30.480 --> 06:32.600
Otherwise,
I would've not given a fuck.

06:32.680 --> 06:36.000
I would've gone there with you
the next night, but it bothers me

06:36.080 --> 06:39.800
because I'm not going there with you
and watch you fuck other people.

06:39.880 --> 06:42.560
Cos, unlike Jemma, I
have some respect for myself.

06:42.640 --> 06:45.880
I'm gonna end the pretending
and let's see where it can go now.

06:45.960 --> 06:48.080
I don't wanna see you
with other people.

06:48.160 --> 06:50.200
Why's that?
Because it hurts me.

06:51.240 --> 06:55.000
And why else?
(laughs) Fuck off, Ashley.

06:55.080 --> 06:57.440
Why else?
I'm interested. I wanna know.

06:57.520 --> 06:59.400
Because it makes me jealous.

06:59.480 --> 07:02.440
He can look at me, not even
do anything, and I'll smile.

07:02.520 --> 07:05.080
No one has that ability but him.

07:05.160 --> 07:08.000
I am apologising now
and I do want us to get on

07:08.080 --> 07:11.440
because when you're smiling
with your little goofy smile...

07:11.520 --> 07:13.520
It's a lot...
My goofy smile?

07:13.600 --> 07:16.000
You've got such a goofy smile,
but it's cute.

07:16.080 --> 07:19.120
I think we should go back
and get along. It's much more fun.

07:19.200 --> 07:21.040
That way, you won't be sulking.

07:21.120 --> 07:23.840
You'll enjoy yourself
and you might get lucky.

07:23.920 --> 07:26.320
(laughs)
So, everyone's winning.

07:26.400 --> 07:28.520
It does feel nice
to be laughing with him

07:28.600 --> 07:33.040
because all we do is flirt,
laugh and have great sex

07:33.120 --> 07:35.680
and we haven't done either
since he's been here.

07:35.760 --> 07:39.600
So, if I do get lucky, you're not
gonna fuck off with someone else?

07:39.680 --> 07:42.480
I didn't say that. I'm joking,
(laughs)

07:42.560 --> 07:45.840
It depends how good you make me feel,
doesn't it?

07:47.880 --> 07:52.040
'You may be laughing now, Kayleigh,
but you should know better than most,

07:52.120 --> 07:55.840
this is Ex On The Beach
and happiness never lasts.'

07:57.080 --> 07:59.440
'Whose ex is next?'

08:04.280 --> 08:06.320
Well, who wants to do
any games later?

08:08.080 --> 08:10.840
I got my lucky shirt on.
Everyone's happy,

08:10.920 --> 08:15.800
but I can see a bit of tension
between Charlotte and Alex.

08:15.880 --> 08:19.800
Alex, have you got anything to get
off your chest while we're all here?

08:19.880 --> 08:23.800
Alex, is there anything you wanna
get off your fucking chest? Fuck off.

08:24.960 --> 08:27.280
It's nice just
to clear the air sometimes.

08:28.520 --> 08:30.360
It's all I'm gonna say on this one.

08:30.440 --> 08:33.720
It's only fair that Alex
knows the truth in this situation.

08:33.799 --> 08:37.600
So, I just asked a question
which will spark a feud.

08:37.679 --> 08:39.679
Do you wanna go chat?
Clear the air?

08:39.760 --> 08:42.799
I'm gonna see Charlotte
She's not told me the truth yet.

08:42.880 --> 08:46.320
If it's a load of bullshit,
I'm just gonna tell her to fuck off.

08:46.400 --> 08:50.720
Wanna do it in front of everybody?
No, I wanna speak on my own with you.

08:50.800 --> 08:52.600
Can't do it in front of everybody.

08:52.680 --> 08:56.120
I was waiting for the right time,
a private conversation.

08:56.200 --> 08:57.800
Do it now. Then it's done.

08:57.880 --> 09:00.440
Come on, Charlotte.
What have you been doing?

09:00.520 --> 09:04.240
I got with two people.
I gave Bear a blowy.

09:04.320 --> 09:05.320
Right.

09:05.400 --> 09:09.600
And then, yeah, I did something
with someone else, Jordan.

09:09.680 --> 09:12.280
Fucking fuming, man.

09:12.360 --> 09:15.520
I'm not even arsed
about you sucking his dick.

09:15.600 --> 09:19.080
I'm just arsed that you just lie.
How have I lied?

09:19.160 --> 09:21.160
You sucking his dick's not an issue

09:21.240 --> 09:23.680
cos they're not even
that good anyway.

09:23.760 --> 09:25.960
He's not said anything
cos it's shit.

09:26.040 --> 09:28.720
Oh, my God.

09:28.800 --> 09:31.640
So, do you know what I mean?
Oh, right. OK, pal.

09:31.720 --> 09:35.240
A below-average blow job?
Are you joking me?

09:35.320 --> 09:38.840
You've been with me for six years.
Why do you keep coming back to me?

09:38.920 --> 09:42.680
Just stop lying. Who else?
Fuck off, you stupid prick. Fuck off.

09:42.760 --> 09:44.640
You can't handle the truth.

09:44.720 --> 09:47.080
She just goes on the attack
straight away.

09:47.160 --> 09:50.000
Fuck off!
You absolute little gimp.

09:50.080 --> 09:53.040
Hilarious.
You can't handle the fucking truth.

09:55.760 --> 09:57.040
'Well, that went well.'

09:57.120 --> 09:59.800
'Maybe Holly making it
up to Conor will go better.'

09:59.880 --> 10:02.240
I don't know what you're thinking.

10:02.320 --> 10:03.800
Fuck's sake. Here it comes.

10:03.880 --> 10:07.280
The whole Hawley thing was just,
like, I was just drunk...

10:07.360 --> 10:09.520
No.
It was just one kiss, Conor.

10:09.600 --> 10:11.080
That's one kiss too many.

10:11.160 --> 10:14.240
You've fucked him.
You've been fingered and kissed him.

10:14.320 --> 10:17.480
Because I heard...
What have I done? Fuck all.

10:17.560 --> 10:20.240
I heard you shagged behind my back.
Yeah, I have.

10:23.400 --> 10:26.960
I have. There was a point when I was
nervous about telling the truth,

10:27.040 --> 10:30.000
but after last night,
I couldn't give two flying fucks.

10:30.680 --> 10:34.480
And I'm glad I did because it proves
that you was just as bad as me.

10:35.280 --> 10:37.120
Happy days.
Are you serious?Yeah.

10:37.200 --> 10:40.160
Am I stupid or something?
Are you fucking winding me up?

10:40.240 --> 10:42.760
I've come in here...
Are you winding me up?

10:42.840 --> 10:44.720
Are you really that scared of me

10:44.800 --> 10:48.080
that it's taken you all this time
to fucking tell me that?

10:48.160 --> 10:50.760
How have you got
any fucking leg to stand on

10:50.840 --> 10:53.280
if you did shag all them
girls behind my back.

10:53.360 --> 10:55.400
Go.
I don't want to get with Hawley!

10:55.480 --> 10:57.080
I want to get with you!

10:57.160 --> 10:59.600
Why are you telling me
you shagged girls?

10:59.680 --> 11:03.360
Are you fucking joking?
Ah, shut up, love. You're boring.

11:03.440 --> 11:05.400
How many times
did I fucking ask you?

11:05.480 --> 11:08.680
I was gonna tell you and then
together and sorting things out

11:08.760 --> 11:12.080
and then you kiss the geezer
that you fucked before I arrived.

11:12.160 --> 11:15.960
I think she's a ho. Piss off.
Go with Hawley. I'm not interested.

11:16.040 --> 11:18.760
Like, I'm done with it.
I'm gonna leave it at that.

11:18.840 --> 11:20.960
Like, I can't be arsed with it.
Fuck off.

11:21.040 --> 11:23.280
You're a fucking bell end.
How many girls?

11:23.360 --> 11:25.680
How many girls was it?

11:25.760 --> 11:28.120
You silly little boy.

11:28.200 --> 11:31.400
The whole time we were sleeping
together meant nothing?

11:31.480 --> 11:33.720
I was drunk.
Was I not good enough?

11:33.800 --> 11:36.000
Why did you shag other girls?
I was drunk.

11:36.080 --> 11:37.240
La, la, la, la, la, la.

11:37.320 --> 11:39.880
We were fine.
Why did you feel the need to shag

11:39.960 --> 11:41.800
all them girls behind my back?

11:41.880 --> 11:43.640
Why are you only telling me now?

11:43.720 --> 11:47.360
I don't understand why.
I don't wanna be with you, do I?

11:47.440 --> 11:50.800
Fuck off, you stupid fucking cunt.
Run off. Get your fanny out.

11:50.880 --> 11:53.080
It's always out
and it's gonna stay out.

11:53.160 --> 11:56.680
My fanny's pretty anyway.
Everyone wants to fucking see it.

11:56.760 --> 11:59.960
Good, because you're a massive slag.
Stupid fucking cunt!

12:00.040 --> 12:01.360
Fuck off!

12:07.400 --> 12:10.560
(all) Hi.
Hello, sexy people.

12:10.640 --> 12:12.520
So what did you do? How was it?

12:12.600 --> 12:15.040
It was actually good
to get some one on one time

12:15.120 --> 12:17.720
and so she can be honest
with herself and me.

12:17.800 --> 12:19.040
We're finally at peace

12:19.120 --> 12:22.880
and I'll be getting right deep
in some pussy tonight. It's standard.

12:22.960 --> 12:24.120
What's gone on here?

12:24.200 --> 12:27.440
Conor decided to tell me that
he did sleep with all them girls.

12:27.520 --> 12:28.680
How many girls?

12:30.440 --> 12:32.000
Don't know. Can't remember.

12:32.080 --> 12:34.120
I don't know. I lost count.

12:34.200 --> 12:37.960
What if one of these girls turns up?

12:38.040 --> 12:41.360
Please don't say that to me.
I'll fucking rip her head off.

12:41.440 --> 12:43.440
She's gonna be fitter than you.

12:43.520 --> 12:47.040
Why are you being like that?
There's no need to get nasty, Conor.

12:51.040 --> 12:55.120
You're in the fucking wrong,
so don't get fucking lairy!

12:55.200 --> 12:56.920
I hate him.

12:57.000 --> 12:59.000
This is what I deal with
every night.

12:59.080 --> 13:01.720
You're in the wrong!
Anyone would react the same!

13:01.800 --> 13:04.960
Stupid, fucking, skinny
little prick!

13:05.040 --> 13:08.880
Let the battles commence tonight.
I'm just stretching. Getting ready.

13:08.960 --> 13:11.080
It's always interesting
in this gaff.

13:17.680 --> 13:21.040
You fucking told me a little bit
of what you'd been up to,

13:21.120 --> 13:22.840
I put on a brave face.

13:22.920 --> 13:26.640
All you've done is scratch
the surface and you're saying to me,

13:26.720 --> 13:29.320
"Oh, I want this to be
an honest relationship."

13:29.400 --> 13:32.480
What's annoyed me is not
what she's done. It's her lying.

13:32.560 --> 13:35.360
If you can't trust someone,
you can't be with them.

13:35.440 --> 13:38.600
I wanna hear what you've been up
to whilst I've not been here.

13:38.680 --> 13:39.760
OK, that's fine.

13:39.840 --> 13:42.600
Oh, God. It's so hard.

13:42.680 --> 13:45.120
I kissed Gaz with Olivia.
A three-way kiss.

13:45.200 --> 13:46.600
There. That's one thing.

13:46.680 --> 13:51.840
Then I've, with Bear, did that.
What did you? What was you and Bear?

13:51.920 --> 13:52.920
Well, you know.

13:53.000 --> 13:55.440
Right, so who else?
What else have you done?

13:55.520 --> 13:59.200
And then Jordan. Went on a date
with Jordan and he went down on me.

13:59.280 --> 14:01.280
There we go.
All right, cool.

14:04.240 --> 14:07.040
Don't tell half a story
and fucking... and that's it.

14:07.120 --> 14:11.080
We're meant to be building bridges.
How are we meant to get past this?

14:11.160 --> 14:13.160
Have a good time.
You have a good time.

14:13.240 --> 14:14.280
Oh, yeah.
Cheers.

14:14.360 --> 14:16.120
Don't cock block me and don't...

14:16.200 --> 14:19.120
Darling, have a fucking great time.
Have a good time!

14:19.200 --> 14:22.040
Don't put a ball and chain on me.
Do it front of my face.

14:22.120 --> 14:24.800
Accept the circumstances.
That's all I'm saying.

14:24.880 --> 14:27.240
And what's that?
What's the circumstances?

14:27.320 --> 14:30.360
Or consequences.
You don't even know the word.

14:30.440 --> 14:31.560
Just fuck off!

14:31.640 --> 14:34.240
If you kiss a girl in front of me,
just accept it.

14:34.320 --> 14:36.360
I fucking will kick off. Trust me.

14:36.440 --> 14:38.880
I'm not gonna disrespect you,
so there you go.

14:38.960 --> 14:43.440
Lol, you're giving blokes chewies
and letting lads go down on you

14:43.520 --> 14:46.080
and you're going on about me
kissing a girl? Lol.

14:46.160 --> 14:50.080
Have you... Oh, lol. Oh, my God,
shut up, you absolute gimp.

14:50.160 --> 14:53.920
She is fucking crazy. (laughs)

14:54.000 --> 14:57.160
If you were in this before me,
you wouldn't do anything?

14:57.240 --> 15:01.640
You're mad about me kissing and
you're letting lads go down on you.

15:01.720 --> 15:04.600
Fuck off! You fucking prick.
Fuck off.

15:04.680 --> 15:07.560
That's two tots. That's two tots.
I fucking hate you.

15:07.640 --> 15:10.040
Typical, when she gets backed
into a corner,

15:10.120 --> 15:11.920
she starts going on the attack.

15:12.000 --> 15:15.120
The only thing she could think
of doing was throw a drink.

15:15.200 --> 15:18.200
It's always my fault.
What the fuck do you get up to?

15:18.280 --> 15:22.720
Because it's probably the truth.
I am fucking single. So are you!

15:22.800 --> 15:25.960
You are so thick. I didn't
give a shit what you'd done.

15:26.040 --> 15:28.840
You don't tell the truth.
It wasn't the right time.

15:28.920 --> 15:31.320
Draw a fucking line under it.
Right.

15:31.400 --> 15:33.000
He's not a fucking angel.

15:37.000 --> 15:40.760
'With Alex and Charlotte's
relationship falling to pieces,

15:40.840 --> 15:45.440
who'll be left with their head in
their hands when the next ex arrives?

15:46.040 --> 15:49.080
'T minus 10 hours.'

15:51.360 --> 15:52.600
Mmm, mmm, mmm.

15:53.640 --> 15:56.200
Are you my bamba?
(laughs)

15:56.280 --> 15:59.600
Lillie's great.
She's beautiful. She's kind.

16:00.360 --> 16:03.120
But Chrysten, she's sexy,

16:03.200 --> 16:06.120
raunchy and I wanna rip
her little panties off.

16:08.920 --> 16:12.400
I see Chrysten walk to the bathroom.
I thought it's time to strike.

16:12.480 --> 16:14.720
I'm in a dilemma.
What?

16:14.800 --> 16:17.760
I really fancy you,
but I'm sort of seeing Lillie.

16:17.840 --> 16:20.840
Yeah, I know.
It's really hard. Do you fancy me?

16:22.160 --> 16:23.680
Do you wanna be my secret?

16:23.760 --> 16:25.200
I don't how I feel.

16:26.200 --> 16:28.560
How are you supposed
to keep that a secret?

16:33.440 --> 16:34.680
Feels good.

16:41.840 --> 16:44.920
It's quite exciting having
a secret kiss no one can see.

16:48.560 --> 16:51.520
Give me a little smoochie
on the woochie.

17:18.240 --> 17:20.800
Do-be-do-be-do. Wash my hands.

17:26.920 --> 17:28.200
I'll meet you upstairs.

17:28.280 --> 17:30.880
Our little secret. Mum's the word.

17:34.280 --> 17:35.520
Fuck.

17:38.200 --> 17:41.000
Ha, ha!
I think I've got away with this one.

17:44.720 --> 17:47.760
It's getting hot up there again.
Huh?

17:51.680 --> 17:54.760
'Ooh, this could get awkward.'

17:54.840 --> 17:59.320
You've got like sting...
stingy lip gloss on.

18:00.400 --> 18:02.040
(laughs)

18:02.120 --> 18:04.560
You're the prettiest in the world.
Am I?

18:04.640 --> 18:07.160
Yeah, I think you are.
Give me a kiss.

18:07.240 --> 18:12.080
Chrysten is my sexy little secret
and she's put there.

18:12.160 --> 18:15.000
We're gonna close her up
and kiss her.

18:15.080 --> 18:19.040
Hold on a minute, babe.
Don't tell no one. Shushee.

18:21.320 --> 18:23.440
Shushee, Chrysten.

18:23.520 --> 18:25.960
Has anything happened? No, yes?

18:27.880 --> 18:31.840
'With Bear and Chrysten's naughty
little secret safe for now,

18:31.920 --> 18:34.280
everyone's bedding down
for the night.'

18:50.960 --> 18:54.000
'But it seems Alex
can't get past Charlotte's betrayal.'

18:54.080 --> 18:57.680
This is the most embarrassing
situation I've ever been.

18:57.760 --> 19:00.720
If I hadn't have come,
I wouldn't have got the truth.

19:00.800 --> 19:04.160
Mate, mate, honestly, come here.
Come here.

19:08.200 --> 19:09.800
Mate, honestly.
Fuck me, man.

19:09.880 --> 19:12.520
Listen, look at us. Look at us.
Look at us. Come on.

19:12.600 --> 19:16.520
(indistinct)

19:17.640 --> 19:19.720
Mate, I went for a chat
with Lillie.

19:22.560 --> 19:24.400
Just had the worst day of my life.

19:36.880 --> 19:41.680
This morning I literally feel the
best I've felt since I've been here.

19:41.760 --> 19:45.120
I had no drama last night
for the first night ever.

19:45.920 --> 19:49.520
I woke up with my Bear. (laughs)
Give me a cuddle. Give me a cuddle.

19:49.600 --> 19:52.360
I think
Bear's slightly sexually frustrated.

19:54.080 --> 19:57.960
I'm so bored of Lillie.
I wanna get my cock wet.

19:59.240 --> 20:00.720
So I've steered right.

20:02.080 --> 20:04.160
What's her name again? Chrysten.

20:05.720 --> 20:08.480
Last night, I can tell
Chrysten wanted to kiss me,

20:08.560 --> 20:10.120
so I done the right thing.

20:10.200 --> 20:13.200
I waited till she went downstairs
and I give her a snog.

20:14.280 --> 20:15.640
Oi, oi.

20:16.720 --> 20:19.240
I walk in and have
to drop a bombshell to Lillie

20:19.320 --> 20:22.680
about her ex cheating on her with me
and now I'm kissing her man.

20:23.400 --> 20:24.480
Awkward!

20:24.560 --> 20:27.920
I've got a smile on my face,
so I can't be feeling that guilty.

20:30.760 --> 20:33.920
Last night I was very angry.
everything came out in the open.

20:34.000 --> 20:35.920
I would like to get back with Alex.

20:36.000 --> 20:38.240
I wanna apologise
and try and make a go of it

20:38.320 --> 20:39.520
cos I love him so much.

20:40.680 --> 20:44.640
I'd be talking shit if I didn't say
Charlotte was the love of my life.

20:44.720 --> 20:47.560
If she apologises,
then we'll see what happens.

20:50.880 --> 20:54.680
Me and Conor have been sleeping
together for the past year

20:54.760 --> 20:58.120
and from the get-go,
I heard he was shagging other girls

20:58.200 --> 20:59.600
and he always denied it,

20:59.680 --> 21:01.560
He's taken the piss out of me

21:01.640 --> 21:05.120
He's got no excuse and he's making
me look like an idiot.

21:06.160 --> 21:08.200
Me and Holly, we're totally done.

21:08.280 --> 21:11.000
As soon as the new arrival comes,
I'll crack on.

21:18.760 --> 21:21.440
What happened between
Ashley and Kayleigh?

21:21.520 --> 21:23.400
We fucked.
(laughter)

21:23.480 --> 21:27.240
It felt like it was a mixture
of making love and fucking.

21:27.320 --> 21:29.120
What happened with you, Bear?

21:29.200 --> 21:31.360
Me and Lillie
just cuddled all night.

21:32.560 --> 21:35.000
It was, it was fucking nuts, yeah.

21:35.080 --> 21:39.560
I give her a cuddle and then I
kissed her lips and... Roar. Crazy.

21:39.640 --> 21:42.120
This guy is a fucking joker.

21:42.200 --> 21:44.440
His cock is as dry
as the Sahara Desert,

21:44.520 --> 21:46.120
all talk, no action.

21:46.200 --> 21:48.960
Bear's balls have
got a heartbeat now.

21:49.040 --> 21:50.360
It's not gonna happen.

21:50.440 --> 21:53.480
I'm thinking about having
an affair. What do you reckon?

21:53.560 --> 21:56.320
(laughter)

21:56.400 --> 21:59.440
And Lillie's next to me laughing.
(laughs)

21:59.520 --> 22:01.000
Oh, naughty Bear.

22:01.080 --> 22:03.840
Go have a secret affair
behind her back.

22:03.920 --> 22:06.120
(laughter)

22:07.160 --> 22:09.240
No, I wouldn't do that.

22:12.680 --> 22:14.600
I just wanna apologise...

22:14.680 --> 22:17.360
Yeah.
...For last night, for swilling you.

22:17.440 --> 22:20.200
Two or three times.
(both laugh)

22:20.280 --> 22:22.240
And I'm sorry for what's happened.

22:22.320 --> 22:25.920
We are meant to be with each other
and I wanna make everything right.

22:26.000 --> 22:28.760
I know you want me
to tell you everything outright,

22:28.840 --> 22:32.480
but how do I know that you wouldn't
have just got up and left me?

22:32.560 --> 22:35.200
I get what you mean.
I didn't want it to go from

22:35.280 --> 22:37.840
us not being together at all
and being exes

22:37.920 --> 22:41.120
to coming in the house
straight away and being so full on.

22:41.200 --> 22:43.600
Charlotte and I know
what buttons to press.

22:43.680 --> 22:45.560
We just need to just chill out.

22:45.640 --> 22:49.480
I wanna be with you.
I know it's gonna be baby steps

22:49.560 --> 22:53.120
and I'm not gonna disrespect you.
I'm not gonna go near anybody.

22:53.200 --> 22:56.640
Everyone else is different.
We were together six years.

22:56.720 --> 23:00.360
Nobody's been like that.
No one's been through what we have.

23:00.440 --> 23:04.120
Being in this villa has made me
realise I wanna get back with Alex.

23:04.200 --> 23:06.880
He is nothing like
these little boys in here.

23:06.960 --> 23:10.760
He's genuine. He's honest. He's loyal
and he is the love of my life.

23:10.840 --> 23:12.360
Come here.

23:15.200 --> 23:17.280
Baby steps.
(laughs)

23:18.160 --> 23:21.600
'It looks like happiness
and harmony have been restored,

23:21.680 --> 23:26.360
but how long before it
descends into heartbreak and hatred?'

23:26.920 --> 23:30.120
'Next ex, T minus one hour.'

23:31.000 --> 23:32.880
(Tablet rings)

23:32.960 --> 23:35.440
(all groan)

23:35.520 --> 23:36.560
Could be anything.

23:36.640 --> 23:39.400
Wave goodbye to the villa
for Bear and Chrysten.

23:39.480 --> 23:42.080
Yeah, get in there, my son!

23:42.160 --> 23:44.920
You're off on a date,
sent from the Tablet of Terror.

23:45.000 --> 23:48.080
I can tell the Tablet of Terror
is trying to get us caught,

23:48.160 --> 23:49.520
what a shit stirrer.

23:49.600 --> 23:52.040
(all) Ooh!

23:52.120 --> 23:54.480
This is going
to get very interesting.

23:54.560 --> 24:00.000
Probably not my first choice to be
sent on a date with Bear right now.

24:00.080 --> 24:02.080
You happy to go
on a date with me or not?

24:02.160 --> 24:04.440
Yeah.
I'm seeing Lillie, so no kissing.

24:04.520 --> 24:07.640
You gotta promise.
Promise. Would I lie?

24:07.720 --> 24:09.560
Have fun you two.
Have fun.

24:13.760 --> 24:15.080
Stop it.

24:20.440 --> 24:22.440
Holy shit,
I hope we don't get caught.

24:25.280 --> 24:28.880
She'll have made both my boyfriends
cheat on me if she kisses him.

24:38.880 --> 24:41.520
'The Tablet of Terror
has sent Holly, Conor

24:41.600 --> 24:44.160
and Gaz to meet the new arrival.'

24:47.480 --> 24:49.120
I just hate this place, man.

24:49.200 --> 24:50.720
I know I hate this beach!

24:50.800 --> 24:54.400
I've been here three times
and had three exes.

24:55.360 --> 24:57.520
Last time,
Chrysten came out the water.

24:57.600 --> 24:59.680
one thing I never expected,

24:59.760 --> 25:02.480
so God knows what the hell
can happen on that beach.

25:02.560 --> 25:05.600
Oh, I feel sick.
I don't wanna be here.

25:05.680 --> 25:07.840
Have you banged
anyone behind my back?

25:07.920 --> 25:09.640
No, Conor,
but I wish I did now.

25:09.720 --> 25:13.080
If one of them slags that Conor
was shagging when he was seeing me

25:13.160 --> 25:16.200
comes out of that water,
I'm gonna go ape shit on him.

25:17.080 --> 25:20.360
If it's mine, I'm getting
drenched again and I know it.

25:20.440 --> 25:22.200
By me or by her?
Probably both.

25:22.280 --> 25:23.280
(laughs)

25:23.360 --> 25:25.560
I can see it coming already.

25:25.640 --> 25:29.240
Imagine I'm living with Lillie,
the ex, the girl I cheated on with,

25:29.320 --> 25:31.480
banging Olivia.
Can't get more fucked.

25:31.560 --> 25:34.280
There's only two in there girls
who aren't my exes.

25:34.360 --> 25:37.240
Gaz, if it's mine you're gonna be
laughing your nut off

25:37.320 --> 25:39.800
cos I'm gonna have
two girls going at me...

25:39.880 --> 25:42.480
It was the same time.
Is that what you're saying?

25:42.560 --> 25:45.000
No, maybe...
Tell me before she gets here

25:45.080 --> 25:47.360
cos I'm gonna ask her.
I haven't got a clue.

25:55.280 --> 25:56.840
How's this for excitement?

25:56.920 --> 26:00.400
Hold on tight, babe. Put your legs
around Bear's big machine.

26:00.480 --> 26:03.520
(screams)
Woo!

26:06.920 --> 26:08.400
(laughs)

26:08.480 --> 26:10.360
He's an insane jet ski driver.

26:12.200 --> 26:13.600
Woo!

26:17.280 --> 26:20.400
I really wanna ride you later.
Oh, Bear!

26:22.960 --> 26:24.120
(laughs)
(screams)

26:26.080 --> 26:28.480
It's like a love story,
me and you, I think.

26:28.560 --> 26:31.320
Is it?
Reckon we get together at the end?

26:31.400 --> 26:33.120
Don't know.
I want to.

26:33.200 --> 26:35.240
I just wanna fuck Chrysten

26:35.320 --> 26:38.720
and go back to Lillie and cuddle
cos Lillie is not putting out.

26:38.800 --> 26:40.200
'Ooh, charming.'

26:40.280 --> 26:42.400
But I don't wanna
leave Lillie just yet,

26:42.480 --> 26:44.080
I wanna have some fun with you.

26:44.160 --> 26:46.760
I don't wanna
make you feel pressured.

26:46.840 --> 26:48.360
Yeah, we're having fun.

26:48.440 --> 26:51.040
Bear's a funny guy.
I just wanna see where it goes,

26:51.120 --> 26:52.520
not fall head over heels.

26:52.600 --> 26:55.720
Do you reckon me and you ever get
caught for what we're up to?

26:55.800 --> 26:58.240
I don't know.
Conor always seems to be there.

26:58.320 --> 27:01.360
He does, don't he? Like, when he
walked in yesterday,

27:01.440 --> 27:02.720
reckon he saw anything?

27:02.800 --> 27:05.840
When you kissed me,
you could hear that you kissed.

27:05.920 --> 27:07.960
I'm terrified
of someone finding out,

27:08.040 --> 27:10.080
but we'll have to stay
one step ahead.

27:10.160 --> 27:11.880
If he says anything, deny it.

27:11.960 --> 27:14.760
Promise you're not gonna tell?
Promise.

27:16.680 --> 27:19.200
Chrysten seems happy
keeping this a secret.

27:23.560 --> 27:24.640
Fine by me.

27:31.440 --> 27:35.120
Mate, my belly is doing cartwheels.

27:36.480 --> 27:38.640
I am fucking shitting myself.

27:38.720 --> 27:41.040
I hate this beach.

27:41.920 --> 27:43.680
I feel like I'm gonna be sick.

27:43.760 --> 27:46.760
Oh, that Tablet of Terror prick,
that's what does it.

27:46.840 --> 27:48.400
Shit's gonna hit the fan.

27:48.480 --> 27:51.680
Four girls, man, and the girl
you're sleeping with. Wicked.

27:51.760 --> 27:53.120
It's just fucked up.

28:13.560 --> 28:14.800
It's not mine.

28:14.880 --> 28:16.800
Thank fuck it's not my ex.

28:18.520 --> 28:19.920
Didn't even notice her.

28:20.000 --> 28:23.200
(sighs)
Yeah, how are you? (laughs)

28:23.280 --> 28:27.640
Oh, how are you?
Oh, it's mine. Great.

28:27.720 --> 28:30.800
Fuck, it's Aimee.
What the fuck are you doing here?

28:30.880 --> 28:34.120
I thought it was yours.
Didn't even recognise her.

28:34.200 --> 28:37.440
Oh, fuck off.
How are you?

28:37.520 --> 28:39.440
I'm Aimee. I'm from Colchester.

28:39.880 --> 28:42.440
In some ways,
I am your typical Essex girl.

28:42.520 --> 28:45.600
I love a sunbed and getting
glammed up for a night out.

28:46.360 --> 28:49.320
I recently came out
of a four-year relationship,

28:49.400 --> 28:52.640
Conor came along and charmed me.
We were happy, having fun

28:52.720 --> 28:55.880
and then I find out he slept
with someone two days after me.

28:55.960 --> 28:57.320
I felt physically sick.

28:58.240 --> 29:01.760
Conor thinks he's this big player,
but he's just a boy

29:01.840 --> 29:04.920
and he needs to be taken down a peg
and I'm the girl to do it.

29:06.240 --> 29:08.080
Sorry, what's your name?
Aimee.

29:08.160 --> 29:10.360
Nice to meet you. I'm Holly.

29:10.440 --> 29:11.520
Fucking go home.

29:11.600 --> 29:13.840
So, erm, how long were you
with Conor for?

29:13.920 --> 29:16.240
I only saw him like two weeks ago.
What?

29:16.920 --> 29:19.000
Conor is a stupid little prick.

29:19.080 --> 29:20.440
I wasn't with you then.

29:20.520 --> 29:23.080
How long before that?
Three weeks.

29:23.160 --> 29:26.120
You stopped sleeping with me
and started with her.

29:26.200 --> 29:29.600
Did it cross over? I'd like to know.
No, it didn't cross over.

29:29.680 --> 29:32.360
Are you sure?
(laughs) It blatantly did.

29:32.440 --> 29:34.680
This is awkward.

29:34.760 --> 29:37.640
It blatantly did.
Fuck knows what I've walked into.

29:37.720 --> 29:39.720
We've been together
for the past year

29:39.800 --> 29:42.000
and we only stopped
about a month ago.

29:42.080 --> 29:45.360
So, is this another one to add
to the list that you shagged?

29:46.360 --> 29:49.160
She knows about the fucking list.

29:49.240 --> 29:51.600
How the fuck does she know
and I didn't?

29:51.680 --> 29:53.440
Are you fucking joking me?

29:53.520 --> 29:56.960
I can't live in a house with someone
you shagged behind my back.

29:57.040 --> 29:58.960
I was past you.
It didn't cross over.

29:59.040 --> 30:01.960
She knows you shagged other girls.
They crossed over.

30:02.040 --> 30:05.480
Shock, it's Holly running her mouth,
not listening to anyone.

30:05.560 --> 30:07.920
Why am I only being told now?
I told you.

30:08.000 --> 30:09.720
By someone I've just met.

30:09.800 --> 30:11.840
I don't even know her name.
I told you.

30:11.920 --> 30:15.240
Holly is definitely a bit loopy,
but I don't blame her.

30:15.320 --> 30:18.200
He done it to me as well.
What do you mean to you?

30:18.280 --> 30:20.880
You slept with someone
two days after me.

30:20.960 --> 30:22.760
Someone in Birmingham.

30:22.840 --> 30:25.240
Aimee starts teaming up with Holly.

30:25.320 --> 30:26.520
And don't lie.

30:26.600 --> 30:29.080
Wait a minute.
I'm not gonna say their name.

30:29.160 --> 30:30.560
Every fucking day,

30:30.640 --> 30:33.480
more shit comes out of the woodwork
with that prick.

30:33.560 --> 30:35.440
Bank holiday weekend?
Yeah.

30:35.520 --> 30:40.280
You fucking joking me?
I asked you about that weekend!

30:40.360 --> 30:43.000
I asked you about that weekend.
I wasn't with you.

30:43.080 --> 30:46.360
I don't give a flying fuck!
Yes, you were, Conor! You were!

30:46.440 --> 30:49.760
You were at my house. You stayed
at my house the weekend before!

30:49.840 --> 30:53.320
My hair's more important than you.
Stop throwing drinks, slag.

30:53.400 --> 30:56.120
I wasn't with you.
Oh, my God, literally, I can't.

30:56.200 --> 30:59.320
I can't deal with this situation.
(Tablet rings)

30:59.400 --> 31:00.720
(sighs)

31:00.800 --> 31:02.120
For fuck's sake!

31:02.200 --> 31:04.600
It's gonna send
Conor and her on a date.

31:04.680 --> 31:07.280
Fucking stupid Tablet's
going in the sea.

31:07.360 --> 31:10.000
"Welcome to the beach, Aimee."
OK.

31:10.080 --> 31:12.040
"You're off on a..."
For fuck's sake.

31:12.120 --> 31:13.640
I can't even read it.

31:13.720 --> 31:17.160
"You're off on a date with Conor
to make a holiday memento

31:17.240 --> 31:20.280
you'll never forget.
From the Tablet of Terror."

31:20.360 --> 31:21.600
Who am I on a date with?

31:21.680 --> 31:23.440
Aimee.
Aimee. This'll be fun.

31:23.520 --> 31:26.400
I can work my charm with her
and get her back tonight.

31:26.480 --> 31:30.080
Oh, wow.
Nice to see you too, mate.

31:30.160 --> 31:33.800
I'm fucking fuming.

31:35.920 --> 31:37.120
I'll fuck her.

31:38.160 --> 31:41.600
'Half of the villa
are restless for love.'

31:41.680 --> 31:43.920
'The rest of them
just want to party.'

31:44.000 --> 31:47.040
'And on top of it,
it's a full moon.'

31:47.120 --> 31:49.160
(howling)

31:49.240 --> 31:50.760
Moon party, mother fuckers!

31:50.840 --> 31:53.280
(screaming)

31:53.360 --> 31:56.800
Me and Ashley are back.
I'm having the time of my life. Woo!

32:00.040 --> 32:02.640
Me and Alex,
we're finally back together.

32:02.720 --> 32:04.280
(cheers)

32:08.040 --> 32:09.920
(cheers)

32:10.680 --> 32:15.400
No one gives a fuck about your date.
All we wanna know is did yous kiss?

32:15.480 --> 32:19.840
I am the best liar. There's no way.
Nothing's coming from me.

32:21.480 --> 32:22.880
No.

32:22.960 --> 32:25.080
Never know. What was you expecting?

32:25.160 --> 32:28.520
Of course I kissed Chrysten.
What do you think, hey?

32:28.600 --> 32:29.960
You're all mugs.

32:30.040 --> 32:34.560
We just had fun. It was on jet skis
all day. It was a good day out, man.

32:34.640 --> 32:36.720
It was good fun.
Did you wanna kiss him?

32:36.800 --> 32:39.000
No.
I think it's just a good friendship.

32:39.080 --> 32:40.520
This is so awkward.

32:41.400 --> 32:44.840
No, we never. To be honest,
I wanted to but I found Lillie,

32:44.920 --> 32:46.240
so it's not fair on her.

32:46.320 --> 32:49.600
I am relieved Bear
and Chrysten didn't kiss, obviously,

32:49.680 --> 32:50.880
cos I do like Bear.

32:50.960 --> 32:54.160
No kisses, please. No kisses.
You'll ruin the painting.

32:54.240 --> 32:58.960
I've got Lillie here like, "Bear,
don't kiss me, mess my make-up up."

32:59.040 --> 33:00.600
I want to look pretty.

33:00.680 --> 33:03.960
Then you've got Chrysten.
Get in the bathroom and fuck me.

33:08.400 --> 33:11.760
'Conor's still keen to rekindle
things with his ex Aimee

33:11.840 --> 33:15.200
and what better way to do it
than make each other bracelets?'

33:15.880 --> 33:18.080
'How cute.'

33:18.160 --> 33:19.240
It's romantic.

33:19.320 --> 33:22.000
We're making bracelets,
I can finally put my charm

33:22.080 --> 33:24.760
into this bracelet
and give it to Aimee. Perfect.

33:24.840 --> 33:27.480
(laughs) Oh, my God.
It says "freak".

33:27.560 --> 33:28.680
He is a freak.

33:28.760 --> 33:30.760
I've got "Conor's bitch".

33:30.840 --> 33:33.560
You're my bitch
the rest of the time you're here.

33:33.640 --> 33:36.040
Conor's taking the piss
with his bracelet.

33:36.640 --> 33:38.000
I'm not your bitch.

33:40.720 --> 33:42.200
I didn't get to speak to you.

33:42.280 --> 33:45.440
I wasn't angry at you arriving.
Yeah, but you was defensive.

33:45.520 --> 33:48.760
I was defensive. Holly didn't
give me a chance to say hello.

33:48.840 --> 33:52.720
I like Aimee. She's hot. I'll get
her back on my side, no problem.

33:52.800 --> 33:56.040
You've rocked up on the beach.
You're flipping 10 out of 10.

33:56.120 --> 33:58.760
You look better than her,
like 110 percent.

33:58.840 --> 34:01.800
She's gonna think, I'm not gonna
be able to get with him.

34:01.880 --> 34:05.000
Classic Conor, pulling all
the lines, laying on the charm,

34:05.080 --> 34:07.000
but I know what he's really like.

34:07.080 --> 34:10.639
I'll tell her straight from the
start. I'll say, Aimee's here now.

34:10.719 --> 34:12.560
I wanna talk with her.

34:12.639 --> 34:15.040
I'll tell her.
I wanna enjoy time with you.

34:15.120 --> 34:17.080
She likes me. I like her.

34:17.159 --> 34:19.920
I'm showing a little bit
of charm and romance here.

34:20.000 --> 34:23.080
I say we have a kiss, make up
and go and meet the guys.

34:23.159 --> 34:26.040
Conor thinks he's a player,
but I'm gonna play him.

34:26.120 --> 34:27.800
Deal?
You can have a peck.

34:29.000 --> 34:32.040
I'm gonna go with the flow
and flirt with him a little bit.

34:32.120 --> 34:34.960
If another guy comes along,
we'll see what happens.

34:36.080 --> 34:38.400
(up-tempo music)

34:38.480 --> 34:40.760
Somebody say full moon party?

34:40.840 --> 34:43.280
Everyone looks wicked.
We've gotta catch up.

34:43.360 --> 34:46.239
Yo, yo! It's your ex?

34:46.320 --> 34:49.520
No, it was fucking Conor's ex.

34:49.600 --> 34:53.600
Who? I'm shocked.
How does anyone find him attractive?

34:53.679 --> 34:56.719
Conor is a lanky little twat.

34:56.800 --> 35:00.280
Her name's Aimee. We stopped
sleeping together a month ago.

35:00.360 --> 35:02.480
They started shagging
three weeks ago.

35:02.560 --> 35:04.720
Bunny boiler me
has been doing her sums

35:04.800 --> 35:06.560
and I think they're both lying.

35:06.640 --> 35:08.720
The reason
I'm so fucking pissed off,

35:08.800 --> 35:12.440
sorry am I the last person to know
that he's shagged half of England?

35:12.520 --> 35:14.640
She knew and I didn't fucking know.

35:14.720 --> 35:17.520
Conor is not
making a lot of friends here.

35:17.600 --> 35:19.720
Things now are only gonna get worse.

35:20.240 --> 35:24.760
'That's right, Gaz. They're gonna
get even worse than you can imagine

35:24.840 --> 35:27.680
with more ex all stars
still to come.'

35:27.760 --> 35:30.920
'Whose ex is next?'

35:31.800 --> 35:34.520
What's happening.
(cheers)

35:35.480 --> 35:37.240
What do these lot look like?

35:37.320 --> 35:38.680
This is, erm, Aimee.

35:38.760 --> 35:39.760
You all right?

35:39.840 --> 35:42.360
She is fire (meows)

35:44.400 --> 35:46.480
I don't give a shit
about your date.

35:46.560 --> 35:48.200
I wanna know if you kissed her.

35:48.280 --> 35:49.600
You didn't kiss?

35:49.680 --> 35:52.200
He asked for a peck
and then that was it.

35:52.800 --> 35:54.840
Conor thinks he's the biggest lad.

35:54.920 --> 35:57.480
Babe,
I'm more of a lad than you are.

35:57.560 --> 35:59.840
When was the last time
you fucked Aimee?

35:59.920 --> 36:02.800
When was the first time
that you fucked Aimee?

36:02.880 --> 36:04.240
Oh, no, here we go.

36:04.320 --> 36:05.520
It was a month...

36:05.600 --> 36:08.440
He can't remember that.
He's fucking loads of girls.

36:08.520 --> 36:10.960
Exactly. March.
Are you fucking stupid?

36:11.040 --> 36:12.840
Weeks before I come out here.

36:13.920 --> 36:15.000
(sighs)

36:15.680 --> 36:19.920
The girl that crossed over with you
was Kayleigh and it's not her. Fact.

36:20.000 --> 36:23.240
There obviously was a cross-over.
I went home to Essex

36:23.320 --> 36:26.240
two weeks before I come out here.
What, Mother's Day?

36:26.320 --> 36:28.400
No.
I did see you at Mother's Day.

36:28.480 --> 36:29.800
(others scream)

36:29.880 --> 36:31.880
I tried to stay really calm.

36:32.880 --> 36:34.280
Ohm...

36:35.480 --> 36:36.600
Fuck off, Conor!

36:36.680 --> 36:39.200
Why are you still lying?
Yeah, it's two weeks.

36:39.280 --> 36:42.320
Even though we were sleeping
together on Mother's Day!

36:42.400 --> 36:44.720
It's two weeks.
Why are you still lying?

36:44.800 --> 36:47.160
You've told me I'm the cheat.
It's two weeks.

36:47.240 --> 36:49.360
You were with me.
You was in Portsmouth.

36:49.440 --> 36:50.840
I'm a nightclub promoter

36:50.920 --> 36:53.960
and I think that I shagged
loads of girls and I'm a twat.

36:54.040 --> 36:57.960
You were sleeping with me then!
I wasn't seeing you then, was I?

36:58.040 --> 36:59.640
Yes, you were.
No, I wasn't.

36:59.720 --> 37:01.200
What, am I magic...?

37:01.280 --> 37:04.280
Am I Mystic fucking Meg
that I know what you're doing

37:04.360 --> 37:06.040
if I wasn't still seeing you?

37:06.120 --> 37:10.560
Mother's Day? I was with my mother.
What are you on about, Holly? Duh.

37:10.640 --> 37:13.640
I wasn't with you.
Am I just making up what you did?

37:13.720 --> 37:16.440
Holly's like a Jack Russell
nipping at your ankles.

37:16.520 --> 37:19.600
Just, like, fuck off.
Leave me alone. Go somewhere else.

37:19.680 --> 37:23.480
Hands up if you think Conor's gonna
get laid by the time he's finished.

37:23.560 --> 37:25.880
Conor is a two-bob mug.

37:25.960 --> 37:27.880
He's not getting laid anymore.

37:27.960 --> 37:31.400
He's got no game.
How on earth did he pull Aimee?

37:31.480 --> 37:35.160
Round of applause for Conor.
(cheers, applause)

37:35.240 --> 37:37.320
Well done.
Who have you slept with?

37:37.400 --> 37:39.640
I don't need to sleep with someone.
No one.

37:39.720 --> 37:42.800
Stop running your mouth.
I'm in a good place right now.

37:42.880 --> 37:46.280
Well done, you're in a good place.
You won't be for very long.

37:46.360 --> 37:47.760
I think he wants to kiss me.

37:47.840 --> 37:50.120
Come on, princess, oh, yeah, wow.

37:50.200 --> 37:52.680
Hang on a minute, mate.
You're full of shit.

37:52.760 --> 37:54.760
Which one's the princess?

37:54.840 --> 37:56.200
You're a slippery snake.

37:56.280 --> 37:58.840
Fucking hell,
stop bringing me into it, Conor.

37:58.920 --> 38:00.840
I have nothing to do with this.

38:00.920 --> 38:02.200
I know what's going on.

38:02.280 --> 38:05.360
I have nothing to do with this.
Stop pointing fingers.

38:05.440 --> 38:07.240
Oh, I wanna fucking kill that guy.

38:07.320 --> 38:11.080
To happiness and good times! Woo!

38:11.160 --> 38:14.720
Bear, you fucked with the wrong
person. I'm too smart for you, geez.

38:14.800 --> 38:16.360
You don't play all the games.

38:16.440 --> 38:19.080
Hang on a minute.
I've got a story for you all.

38:19.160 --> 38:21.720
Chrysten's doing
her make-up yesterday.

38:21.800 --> 38:24.120
I go downstairs into the bedroom.

38:24.200 --> 38:27.440
I see in the reflection,
you're kissing her in the bathroom,

38:27.520 --> 38:28.680
explain that for me.

38:31.280 --> 38:33.360
(Ashley laughs)

38:34.600 --> 38:36.640
Am I missing something?

38:36.720 --> 38:38.800
Talk to me now, Bear.
Oh!

38:38.880 --> 38:41.720
Come on, big man.
Gentleman over here, talk to me now.

38:41.800 --> 38:43.920
Kissing her behind her back.

38:44.000 --> 38:47.600
Maybe you wanted to kiss her
and you're seeing things.

38:47.680 --> 38:50.240
They can't prove nothing.

38:50.320 --> 38:53.680
I'm not bullshit. Chrysten,
did you kiss him in the bathroom?

38:53.760 --> 38:56.920
I see it with my own eyes.
No, shush, is that true Chrysten?

38:57.000 --> 38:58.440
Shh...

38:58.520 --> 39:02.440
Shush! Chrysten, is it true?
Yes.

39:02.520 --> 39:06.280
(all scream)

39:11.280 --> 39:14.240
Didn't expect that.
I'm so embarrassed.

39:22.160 --> 39:23.800
I couldn't lie anymore.

39:26.360 --> 39:29.640
Lillie, you've pushed me to this.
Sorry, babe.

39:29.720 --> 39:29.920
