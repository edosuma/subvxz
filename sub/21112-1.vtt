<i>Hi, this is Alice and John.</i>

01:33.542 --> 01:35.417
<i>We are not available to take your call.</i>

01:35.918 --> 01:37.667
<i>You know what to do. Bye bye!</i>

01:38.834 --> 01:40.042
<i>Hi, Honey!</i>

01:41.584 --> 01:42.959
<i>It’s over.</i>

01:43.417 --> 01:47.042
It was a beautiful day
and we missed you very much,

01:47.083 --> 01:49.083
but I understand why you couldn’t come.

01:49.959 --> 01:52.209
<i>Alice, I’m so sorry this happened.</i>

01:52.709 --> 01:55.709
<i>I hope you know how much I love you
and I’m here for you.</i>

01:56.459 --> 02:00.125
<i>And God, I know you know
how much John loved you!</i>

02:00.959 --> 02:03.000
<i>Ok, I’ll call you later.</i>

04:00.042 --> 04:01.792
Wow!

04:26.626 --> 04:28.584
It’s beautiful!

04:32.584 --> 04:37.334
You are crazy.
You know that, right? You know that.

04:37.375 --> 04:40.417
- You like it?
- Yes, very much!

04:40.459 --> 04:41.709
It’s beautiful!

04:48.542 --> 04:52.959
- I love it! I love it!
- I love it!

04:54.334 --> 04:55.918
<i>It’s beautiful!</i>

05:44.417 --> 05:45.501
Tell me.

05:45.667 --> 05:47.834
<i>Hmmm? To the left?</i>

05:48.584 --> 05:49.751
<i>Left?</i>

05:50.125 --> 05:51.918
<i>Izquierda</i>.

05:52.209 --> 05:53.792
You’re speaking in Spanish.

05:54.167 --> 05:55.250
<i>Yes!</i>

05:57.792 --> 05:58.918
Perfect!

06:00.709 --> 06:03.334
Did you bring this from there to here?

06:06.375 --> 06:08.959
- Why?
- I traveled to Cadaqués for this painting.

06:10.167 --> 06:14.209
The landscapes of this painter
impress me enormously.

06:14.709 --> 06:17.125
They affect me actually,
especially this one.

06:17.167 --> 06:19.209
It’s like a photo
that I would like to take.

06:20.042 --> 06:24.501
An observer being portrayed
by another observer?

06:25.083 --> 06:26.083
You know?

06:27.292 --> 06:31.042
Hum? It’s like you,
observing the whole world?

06:31.083 --> 06:33.667
- For you.
- And me observing you? Right?

06:33.709 --> 06:35.626
- Let me tell you?
- Inside my own place?

06:35.667 --> 06:37.626
Let me finish! Please!

06:37.751 --> 06:40.959
In my comfort and you outside.
Uh huh? Got it!

06:41.083 --> 06:44.667
That’s why I prefer pictures
that could be an inspiration

06:44.709 --> 06:49.292
and not just images
that remind me of what I already did.

06:50.375 --> 06:51.375
That’s why...

06:51.417 --> 06:53.959
You like it
because it looks like a picture.

06:54.083 --> 06:55.834
That’s why you like it.

07:35.250 --> 07:37.417
<i>Hi, this is Alice and John.</i>

07:37.459 --> 07:39.417
<i>We are not available to take your call.</i>

07:40.042 --> 07:42.542
<i>You know what to do. Bye bye!</i>

07:42.626 --> 07:44.125
<i>Hey Alice, it’s me again.</i>

07:44.167 --> 07:47.959
<i>So listen, I’m leaving for Amsterdam
in the morning and?</i>

07:48.042 --> 07:50.876
<i>Well, I was just hoping
to see you before I go.</i>

07:51.042 --> 07:53.250
<i>Please, please pick up?</i>

07:56.125 --> 07:57.209
<i>Ok.</i>

07:57.250 --> 07:58.709
<i>You stay strong honey!</i>

07:59.083 --> 08:00.125
<i>I love you!</i>

08:06.250 --> 08:07.375
Ahhh!

08:10.876 --> 08:12.417
Ahh?

08:17.334 --> 08:20.042
I feel myself like in my twenties.

08:21.083 --> 08:23.792
You live your life
like you are in your twenties!

08:32.958 --> 08:34.833
Did I tell you that I love you?

08:36.918 --> 08:39.082
- Yes.
- When?

08:40.333 --> 08:41.583
In the elevator.

08:45.125 --> 08:47.375
Yes, you told me!

09:27.083 --> 09:28.167
I love it!

09:29.417 --> 09:30.834
<i>I love it?</i>

17:16.041 --> 17:18.626
<i>Hello, this is Doctor Ana?</i>

18:28.125 --> 18:30.375
- Hey! Hi!
- Hi!

18:30.417 --> 18:32.375
- Do you speak English?
- Yes I do.

18:32.626 --> 18:35.918
I’m looking for Ana,
she lives here on the second floor.

18:35.959 --> 18:38.918
I buzzed a couple of hours ago,
but it looks like nobody’s there.

18:38.959 --> 18:40.250
Ana is out of town.

18:40.292 --> 18:42.876
Can I get your name
or do you want a message?

18:42.918 --> 18:44.125
Oh! Yes?

18:45.083 --> 18:47.501
Can you tell her that Alice was here.

18:47.584 --> 18:49.501
- Oh! You’re Alice!
- Yes!

18:49.542 --> 18:51.876
Ok, I do have something for you.
Just a minute.

19:11.876 --> 19:14.042
It’s for you. She left it here.

19:14.083 --> 19:16.334
- Thank you! Thank you so much!
- You’re welcome.

19:22.876 --> 19:24.709
- Hi!
- Thank you!

19:26.626 --> 19:27.626
Hi!

19:29.083 --> 19:30.667
May I have a hot chocolate, please?

19:30.709 --> 19:32.334
<i>- Hot chocolate?</i>
- Yes.

19:47.792 --> 19:48.792
Thank you!

20:07.959 --> 20:09.292
<i>Dear Alice!</i>

20:09.584 --> 20:13.125
<i>Over the last few months I have rewritten
this letter a number of times</i>

20:13.167 --> 20:15.125
<i>because I have been traveling a lot.</i>

20:15.167 --> 20:17.792
<i>I still have hope that one of these days</i>

20:17.834 --> 20:20.459
<i>I will return to find you waiting
for me here,</i>

20:20.876 --> 20:22.501
<i>just like the good old days.</i>

20:22.792 --> 20:26.042
<i>In this envelope,
I left you a copy of my house key</i>

20:26.083 --> 20:28.042
<i>and my bike key.</i>

20:29.042 --> 20:30.958
<i>Yes. My bike key.</i>

20:30.959 --> 20:33.375
<i>So you can enjoy the city
as the locals do.</i>

20:33.584 --> 20:36.083
<i>It’s outside, to the
right of the building.</i>

20:36.125 --> 20:37.792
<i>It’s a black bike.</i>

20:38.459 --> 20:40.959
<i>Anyway, I am collecting
and registering samples</i>

20:41.042 --> 20:43.626
<i>from the lake that I told you about,
on the border of Austria.</i>

20:43.667 --> 20:45.667
<i>Now, I’ll be here until the 16th.</i>

20:45.959 --> 20:47.918
<i>In the kitchen, you will find directions</i>

20:47.959 --> 20:50.959
<i>in case you would like
to come and meet me here.</i>

20:51.334 --> 20:53.209
<i>It’s a nice change of pace for a doctor</i>

20:53.250 --> 20:56.042
<i>who has not left the halls
of a hospital in years.</i>

20:56.834 --> 21:00.167
<i>You know? He always wanted that for you.</i>

21:00.751 --> 21:03.876
<i>You need this in your life,
but you resisted?</i>

21:04.083 --> 21:06.918
<i>And now, it’s time.</i>

21:08.667 --> 21:10.375
<i>This is your life.</i>

Hello there, welcome!

29:12.918 --> 29:14.292
What would you like to have?

29:16.292 --> 29:19.042
- A nice cup of coffee, something warm?
- Yes.

29:19.083 --> 29:21.751
- Yes? Shall I make you a Cappuccino?
- Yes.

29:21.792 --> 29:23.192
- All right, thank you.
- Thank you.

30:01.083 --> 30:03.042
<i>Did I tell you that I love you?</i>

33:43.417 --> 33:45.959
<i>Sucesso com o público.</i>

33:46.167 --> 33:47.918
That’s good?

33:47.959 --> 33:50.626
- Yes, that’s it.
- What does it mean?

33:51.167 --> 33:53.334
Success with the audience.

33:54.167 --> 33:55.751
Success with the audience?

33:55.834 --> 33:59.167
- It’s like a Italian word, right!
- Yeah, kind of?

33:59.250 --> 34:00.709
<i>- Sucesso.
- Sucesso.</i>

34:00.792 --> 34:02.584
<i>Sucesso com o público.</i>

34:02.626 --> 34:04.292
How do you say that in Spanish?

34:05.459 --> 34:06.501
<i>Exito</i>.

34:06.709 --> 34:08.250
- <i>Exito</i> ?
- Yeah.

34:08.333 --> 34:12.125
And how do you say "I love you"
in <i>Português</i> ?

34:12.292 --> 34:13.542
<i>Eu Te amo.</i>

34:14.125 --> 34:17.417
- Say it again, I didn’t?
<i>- Eu Te amo.</i>

34:18.708 --> 34:19.833
<i>Say it again.</i>

34:19.876 --> 34:22.458
<i>Eu Te amo?</i>

42:28.250 --> 42:31.042
You don’t need
to run from me, there’s no problem.

42:31.083 --> 42:32.876
I’m not gonna do anything, ok?

42:33.459 --> 42:34.584
Excuse me?

42:35.209 --> 42:36.250
Sorry.

42:37.334 --> 42:40.959
You ran from me, but it’s no problem.

42:41.250 --> 42:42.792
I just took one picture.

42:42.959 --> 42:44.839
It’s a beautiful picture,
do you want to see it?

42:56.083 --> 42:57.501
Are you following me?

42:58.083 --> 43:01.083
No, it’s? just the moment.

43:02.042 --> 43:03.959
I’m interested in the moment, you know?

43:04.042 --> 43:05.334
And I saw you and...

43:06.292 --> 43:07.751
There’s something with you.

43:16.918 --> 43:17.959
Do you want to see it?

43:22.709 --> 43:25.709
- Are you a photographer?
- Yes.

43:25.751 --> 43:28.209
- Full-time photographer?
- Yes.

43:28.334 --> 43:31.417
I work in Salzburg
and I make this trip everyday and...

43:31.876 --> 43:34.292
I’m looking for moments to enjoy.

43:37.042 --> 43:38.125
Where are you going?

43:39.125 --> 43:40.584
I just lost my train.

43:40.667 --> 43:42.542
- You lost your train?
- Yes.

43:43.167 --> 43:45.959
You want to play around
on a train taking pictures?

43:46.959 --> 43:48.167
Just fool around?

43:49.209 --> 43:50.542
Have a drink maybe?

43:52.083 --> 43:53.876
What do you think?

43:54.834 --> 43:57.375
- Ok.
- You stay here or you come with me?

44:00.584 --> 44:02.167
- Let’s go!
- I’ll go with you.

44:04.459 --> 44:07.501
- Your? ticket.
- Thanks!

44:13.375 --> 44:14.542
All right?

44:17.167 --> 44:18.876
I don’t know if it’s good.

44:30.250 --> 44:31.292
Cheers!

44:39.792 --> 44:40.834
So?

44:43.042 --> 44:44.709
Traveling in trains.

44:51.751 --> 44:53.334
I have a...

44:54.042 --> 44:58.042
I have an aunt.
She met my uncle on a train?

44:58.751 --> 45:00.042
Going to New York.

45:00.083 --> 45:01.667
She’s from Munich?

45:02.417 --> 45:05.083
And he’s from Romania.

45:06.083 --> 45:07.959
And they did that crazy thing, you know,

45:08.042 --> 45:10.626
they met and they
fell in love on a train.

45:12.918 --> 45:14.083
- They never left.
- Ok!

45:14.125 --> 45:16.167
Yeah? And they live in Israel today.

45:16.375 --> 45:18.751
Crazy things? You shouldn’t do them.

45:18.959 --> 45:21.042
On a train, you shouldn’t do that.

45:22.876 --> 45:24.292
I fell asleep.

45:25.792 --> 45:27.334
I really fell asleep.

45:33.375 --> 45:35.792
That’s it!

45:35.959 --> 45:37.751
- Yes!
- That’s the wine!

45:37.959 --> 45:40.709
How do I look?

45:43.083 --> 45:45.417
- You want to learn how to use this?
- Yep!

45:45.459 --> 45:46.542
So I’m coming over there!

45:50.042 --> 45:52.250
Something more experimental, really!

45:52.792 --> 45:55.334
You have to come close. Take your time.

46:02.250 --> 46:03.542
Take it off.

46:05.918 --> 46:07.667
Yes.

46:08.250 --> 46:09.918
Be courageous!

46:09.959 --> 46:12.250
Take it off. Let me see your hair.

46:16.751 --> 46:19.584
- Oh, my goodness!
- It’s much better!

46:24.042 --> 46:28.959
No! Give me back! Ok!

46:46.125 --> 46:49.375
- Was it that bad? Really?
- What?

46:50.584 --> 46:52.250
- My face.
- When?

46:52.292 --> 46:53.584
So serious.

46:55.709 --> 46:56.792
When?

46:57.334 --> 46:59.542
When you took that picture of me.

47:01.083 --> 47:04.959
No? It’s never bad.
It’s just you, it’s just...

47:05.292 --> 47:07.042
- The moment.
- Yeah.

47:07.417 --> 47:09.375
Do you believe in coincidence?

47:10.584 --> 47:12.792
Coincidence? Like what?

47:13.584 --> 47:17.250
Like, I lost my train, you were there...

47:18.250 --> 47:20.626
There was nobody else, just us.

47:24.042 --> 47:27.209
No, it’s too...

47:29.459 --> 47:32.042
Too interesting to be just coincidence.

47:32.417 --> 47:33.459
Maybe?

47:34.083 --> 47:36.334
I think everything happens for a reason.

47:39.250 --> 47:40.959
We just have to take that.

47:43.709 --> 47:45.292
- Yeah.
- Go for it.

47:45.334 --> 47:46.709
But then again, maybe, yeah?

47:47.751 --> 47:49.918
Maybe it’s just a coincidence...

47:56.459 --> 47:58.042
Yeah, maybe...

47:59.083 --> 48:00.918
Interesting question...

48:05.584 --> 48:07.834
But we met, probably, for a reason

48:07.876 --> 48:09.626
and we just have to find out.

48:15.042 --> 48:16.292
Let’s put it that way?

48:19.292 --> 48:20.667
Can you live with that?

48:21.584 --> 48:23.959
- Live in the moment?
- Yeah.

48:24.918 --> 48:26.584
Can you live with that idea?

48:26.626 --> 48:30.083
That interpretation of coincidence?

48:32.167 --> 48:34.292
I’m not sure anymore.

48:35.459 --> 48:37.042
Have you ever been sure?

50:10.751 --> 50:12.417
<i>Turn Right.</i>

50:15.375 --> 50:17.542
<i>Take the second exit.</i>

50:25.125 --> 50:29.792
<i>Continue 1.2 kilometers
then turn right on road.</i>

53:25.375 --> 53:26.667
You’re here!

53:30.959 --> 53:32.375
I missed you!

53:34.417 --> 53:36.584
- Are you leaving?
- Yeah.

53:46.209 --> 53:47.792
It’s cold outside.

53:48.876 --> 53:50.083
Take this.

54:02.042 --> 54:05.083
- Are you sure? You ok?
- I’m ok.

55:02.959 --> 55:04.626
- Hello!
- Hello!

55:04.667 --> 55:07.083
- Here you are.
- Thank you.

55:15.417 --> 55:17.626
And then after all that talking

55:17.709 --> 55:19.042
this guy tells me:

55:19.542 --> 55:23.167
"It’s not me. The bar is over
a hundred years old."

55:23.417 --> 55:25.751
- And how old was he?
- A hundred years old.

55:28.542 --> 55:30.250
And the people there?

55:31.250 --> 55:33.042
<i>How could I not capture that?</i>

55:34.209 --> 55:36.042
<i>You should see them one day.</i>

55:39.459 --> 55:40.834
Don’t start!

55:40.918 --> 55:44.292
I stayed there for a month,
just photographing.

55:44.334 --> 55:47.959
- A whole month?
- Yeah! I couldn’t stop!

55:49.042 --> 55:50.709
This is amazing!

55:52.209 --> 55:53.459
You are good!

55:55.334 --> 55:56.709
Beautiful work!

55:56.792 --> 55:59.918
You should try, at least once,

56:01.083 --> 56:02.501
to go with me.

56:04.042 --> 56:05.792
Don’t ask me that.

56:06.083 --> 56:08.876
- Why?
- I hate airports, you know that.

56:10.042 --> 56:13.751
I hate luggage.
All that people, crazy people.

56:15.209 --> 56:16.250
No.

56:18.083 --> 56:20.501
I can be here, waiting for you.

56:21.167 --> 56:23.834
I love to hear your stories.
You’re amazing!

56:23.876 --> 56:25.959
I promise you will do it.

56:26.375 --> 56:27.542
Someday?

56:37.792 --> 56:39.501
Why you don’t drink the juice?

56:43.083 --> 56:44.375
It’s good for your health!

56:44.876 --> 56:48.959
- Yeah.
- Yeah. You like this place?

56:49.918 --> 56:52.459
Yes? You look so sad.

56:52.959 --> 56:56.250
Tell me...

56:57.042 --> 56:58.167
What’s wrong with you?

57:01.792 --> 57:04.959
This place reminds me
of a very special person.

57:05.042 --> 57:08.125
- Yeah?
- Yes, he was my husband.

57:08.542 --> 57:10.125
- Ok.
- He’s just gone!

57:10.167 --> 57:11.209
Yeah.

57:11.250 --> 57:14.042
- Nine months ago.
- Short time?

57:14.083 --> 57:16.125
- Yeah.
- He was young?

57:17.292 --> 57:20.751
- Full of life.
- Full of life, that’s terrible!

57:21.125 --> 57:24.292
- Have something to eat.
- I’m not hungry.

57:25.125 --> 57:28.959
Try it. It is good for you.

57:29.459 --> 57:32.042
You have to drink something,
you have to eat something.

57:32.167 --> 57:35.083
It’s good for the health.
It makes you happy, food.

57:35.375 --> 57:37.083
- Thank you.
- You’re welcome!

57:39.334 --> 57:42.918
You are a young woman.
You are a beautiful woman.

57:43.250 --> 57:44.250
Thank you.

57:44.292 --> 57:45.876
And we have only one life.

57:46.792 --> 57:49.417
- Yes.
- Yes? Ok, try it.

57:49.459 --> 57:51.167
- I will.
- You have only one life!

57:52.125 --> 57:54.042
- I promise.
- Ok.
