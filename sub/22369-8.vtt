00:05.005 --> 00:07.424
I'm really excited
about my performance tonight,

00:07.507 --> 00:11.010
so I thought I'd give you guys a few
tips on if you ever visit New York City.

00:11.094 --> 00:14.222
So, first of all,
if you ever want to go somewhere

00:14.305 --> 00:17.851
you have to take something called a cab.

00:17.934 --> 00:20.478
So, how you get a cab to come to you

00:20.562 --> 00:23.773
is you stand on the street
and you wave your hands.

00:23.857 --> 00:25.275
So, example.

00:27.819 --> 00:31.823
So, if I saw a cab,
I'd be, like, "Hey." Like that.

00:31.906 --> 00:33.742
And then the cab would come, so...

00:33.825 --> 00:38.872
Also, that is the Empire State Building
or something, so...

00:38.955 --> 00:41.458
That's where everyone
in New York City works, so...

00:41.541 --> 00:45.003
All right, well, I hope
if anyone who lives here can...

00:45.086 --> 00:46.129
Will...

00:46.212 --> 00:50.133
Can come to my show tonight, so...

00:52.343 --> 00:54.012
'Kay, bye.

01:03.354 --> 01:04.355
Cut.

so now you just upload it.

reshoot it or anything?

of your sentences.

He just took her without asking.

you're still defending him.

I am an expert on traveling 'cause I'm
very famous, and I travel a lot, so...

20:43.492 --> 20:46.578
Tip number one.
Always travel with a neck pillow.

So if you don't have one,
they're really easy to make.

20:48.830 --> 20:51.124

using bubble wrap, like this.

- [POPS]

20:58.090 --> 21:01.009
Also, if you get hungry,
you're gonna want snacks.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.929
But they do not let snacks
through security,

21:04.012 --> 21:05.681
so you have to hide them. All right?

21:05.764 --> 21:06.932
So, I'll teach you how to do that.

21:07.015 --> 21:10.310
So, here we go. I today have beef jerky.

21:10.394 --> 21:14.106
So, what you're going to do
is you just take it, like so,

21:14.189 --> 21:15.774
hide it in your clothes, like this,

21:15.857 --> 21:20.028
and then, when you get hungry,
you can just poke it out like this...
