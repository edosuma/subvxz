WEBVTT

00:05.001 --> 00:09.100
Ohh! I've got mosquito bites.
I've got blisters.

00:09.100 --> 00:14.000
- I hate those new boots.
- Honey. Why are you so P.O.'d?

00:14.000 --> 00:16.800
- I thought we had a good time.
- You had a good time.

00:16.800 --> 00:21.100
You had a fine time tromping around
and leaving me a half a mile behind.

00:21.100 --> 00:25.200
Look, for future reference, me running through
the woods after you for an entire day is...

00:25.200 --> 00:28.000
...not my idea of a good time.

00:28.000 --> 00:30.000
I'm sorry.

00:30.400 --> 00:33.300
I've got longer legs.

00:33.300 --> 00:36.200
I was excited, you know?

00:36.200 --> 00:40.000
The great outdoors,
communing with nature.

00:40.600 --> 00:42.200
Your head hurt?

00:42.200 --> 00:43.900
Yeah.

00:44.300 --> 00:49.100
You can hit me in the head with a rock
if it'll make you feel better.

00:49.200 --> 00:52.900
Fine. Go get one.

00:54.000 --> 00:56.700
I'm taking a shower.

00:58.000 --> 01:04.074

01:56.500 --> 01:58.700
You still mad at me?

01:58.700 --> 02:00.200
No.

02:00.200 --> 02:02.500
I'm not mad.

02:03.500 --> 02:05.500
Come here.

02:11.200 --> 02:13.900
So I guess we're never
going hiking again.

02:13.900 --> 02:18.200
It's indoors forever
from now on.

02:19.400 --> 02:22.100
Angie, honey, what's up?

02:22.900 --> 02:25.600
Just hold me.

03:45.000 --> 03:48.300
I don't know what they did with
the screen for this thing.

03:48.300 --> 03:50.400
Now, this is Angela and Wallace Schiff.

03:50.400 --> 03:54.900
It's a young married couple last seen hiking in
the vicinity of Brown Mountain, North Carolina.

03:54.900 --> 03:57.200
That's Angie on the right.

03:57.200 --> 03:59.800
I should add that this is the condition in
which their bodies were found after...

03:59.800 --> 04:04.100
...being missing for only three days... in
temperatures that never got above 70 degrees.

04:04.100 --> 04:06.500
Which rules out decomposition.

04:06.500 --> 04:09.400
I'd say predation, but the... the
bones would be scattered.

04:09.400 --> 04:13.300
Not to mention that these skeletons
are not wearing any clothes.

04:13.300 --> 04:14.800
Right.

04:14.800 --> 04:18.800
Well, I'd say it looks like a double murder,
possibly one with ritualistic overtones.

04:18.800 --> 04:24.100
The bodies may have been stripped then
skeletonized, possibly by boiling or...

04:24.100 --> 04:26.900
...by the use of some kind
of acid solution.

04:26.900 --> 04:31.100
Maybe the arrangement of the bodies has some
meaning for the killer or killers.

04:31.100 --> 04:35.300
- But at any rate, I'd term it "ritualistic."
- That's a pretty big operation you're describing.

04:35.300 --> 04:40.200
There was no evidence found at the scene.
No tire tracks, no footprints, nothing.

04:40.200 --> 04:44.900
- Well, what do you think this is?
- It's Brown Mountain, Scully. That doesn't ring a bell?

04:44.900 --> 04:46.600
The Brown Mountain lights?

04:46.600 --> 04:50.900
It's a famous atmospheric phenomenon dating back
nearly 700 years witnessed by thousands...

04:50.900 --> 04:53.400
...of people, back to
the Cherokee Indians.

04:53.400 --> 04:57.200
Strange multicolored lights are seen to
dance above the peak of the mountain.

04:57.200 --> 05:01.100
There's been no geological explanation,
no scientific credible explanation at all.

05:01.100 --> 05:03.400
And what does that have
to do with these two?

05:03.400 --> 05:06.400
As I said, there's been no scientific
credible explanation but...

05:06.400 --> 05:09.600
...there are those of us who believe these
strange multicolored lights are really...

05:09.600 --> 05:11.200
UFOs.

05:11.200 --> 05:16.000
Extraterrestrial visitors from beyond who
apparently have nothing better to do than...

05:16.000 --> 05:20.100
...buzz one mountain over and
over again for 700 years.

05:20.100 --> 05:24.900
Sounds like crap when you say it. I'm just
wondering if there's a connection, Scully.

05:24.900 --> 05:28.700
I mean, the conditions of these bodies are
reminiscent of certain southwestern cattle mutilations.

05:28.700 --> 05:33.600
Those are cases where there's no physical evidence
and they've long been associated with UFO activity.

05:33.600 --> 05:38.500
Mulder, can't you just for once, just... for the
novelty of it, come up with the simplest...

05:38.500 --> 05:44.400
...explanation, the most logical one, instead of
automatically jumping to UFOs or Bigfoot or...?

05:44.400 --> 05:48.700
Scully, in six years, how... how
often have I been wrong?

05:48.700 --> 05:49.800
No, seriously.

05:49.800 --> 05:53.300
I mean, every time I bring you a new case
we go through this perfunctory dance.

05:53.300 --> 05:57.000
You tell me I'm not being scientifically
rigorous and that I'm off my nut, ...

05:57.000 --> 06:02.300
...and then in the end who turns out to be
right like 98.9% of the time?

06:03.000 --> 06:07.900
I just think I've... earned the
benefit of the doubt here.

06:17.800 --> 06:22.200
We gave them adjoining suites. I was
ready to send them on to Chapel Hill.

06:22.200 --> 06:25.100
Figured the state medical examiner
should have a look at them.

06:25.100 --> 06:27.400
We appreciate you holding off.

06:27.400 --> 06:31.800
- The connective tissue is more or less intact.
- Unlike everything else.

06:31.800 --> 06:35.000
I'm not sure what to make of it
considering the short time frame.

06:35.000 --> 06:38.400
If you'll, um, pardon an obvious question, ...

06:38.400 --> 06:44.700
...are you sure that these are the right two bodies and
not two others that have lain out for six months?

06:45.800 --> 06:52.300
We triple-checked the dental records.
Angela and Wallace Schiff. No doubt about it.

06:59.900 --> 07:03.700
And they were both found near
Brown Mountain, right?

07:03.700 --> 07:05.400
Where exactly?

07:05.400 --> 07:08.500
Well, I could write you some directions.

07:09.800 --> 07:13.600
Would you, uh, happen to
know what this is?

07:13.600 --> 07:16.200
Well, the remains were
found in a swampy area.

07:16.200 --> 07:21.100
It's some sort of organic material
relating to that. It's bog sludge.

07:21.100 --> 07:24.600
I'm going to check out where
the bodies were found.

07:27.800 --> 07:31.700
- You coming?
- No. You go ahead.

08:29.100 --> 08:31.800
Wallace Schiff?

09:07.300 --> 09:09.300
Wallace Schiff?

09:15.900 --> 09:18.300
We got your gas spectrometer results.

09:18.300 --> 09:23.400
That stuff on the bones I said
was bog sludge? It isn't.

09:23.800 --> 09:28.800
Water, hydrochloric acid... electrolytes,
pepsins and trypsins.

09:29.000 --> 09:31.300
It's a digestive secretion.

09:31.300 --> 09:34.800
It's stomach juices pretty much.
Pretty damn close to it...

09:34.800 --> 09:36.500
Except for this.

09:36.500 --> 09:37.900
Chitinase?

09:37.900 --> 09:44.400
It's a digestive enzyme as well but
it's strictly plant, not animal.

10:01.300 --> 10:03.200
Hello!

10:17.700 --> 10:20.600
I told you, I'd seen this before.

10:20.600 --> 10:23.600
These are the two I remember anyway.

10:28.500 --> 10:31.000
Both of these were discovered
as skeletal remains.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.800
Right, but we saw nothing odd in that.

10:34.800 --> 10:39.400
Both were lost hikers found months or
years later or whatever it says there.

10:39.400 --> 10:44.800
It says here that the bodies were found not far
from where Angela and Wallace Schiff turned up.

10:55.700 --> 10:58.500
Oh, Mulder, answer your phone.

10:59.000 --> 11:01.100
The cellular customer you are trying...

11:01.100 --> 11:02.000
Do me a favor.

11:02.000 --> 11:06.100
I want you to forward a sample of that
secretion over to the FBI lab at Quantico.

11:06.100 --> 11:08.700
I want them to run a complete analysis.

11:08.700 --> 11:13.000
- You got it.
- And, uh, in the meantime, could I borrow your truck?

11:24.000 --> 11:26.200
Please...

11:26.500 --> 11:28.300
Don't take me.

11:28.300 --> 11:30.300
Then, come out here.

11:30.300 --> 11:32.800
Step closer.
I won't hurt you.

11:35.300 --> 11:38.700
- You're not one of them?
- One of who?

11:40.800 --> 11:43.300
Are you Wallace Schiff?

11:46.800 --> 11:51.100
Well, I hate to tell you this, Wallace,
but you're supposed to be dead.

11:51.100 --> 11:54.100
They found your skeleton
not 200 yards from here.

11:54.100 --> 11:56.000
It's fake.

11:56.000 --> 11:59.500
- They put it there.
- Who put it there?

12:01.000 --> 12:03.000
You know who.

12:03.000 --> 12:05.500
The Brown Mountain lights.

12:05.500 --> 12:08.500
They abducted us... me and my wife Angela.

12:08.500 --> 12:12.100
They took us on board their... oh, God.

12:12.100 --> 12:15.000
Wallace... Wallace?

12:15.400 --> 12:18.600
They found your wife Angela, too...

12:18.600 --> 12:21.800
Lying right alongside your skeleton.

12:21.800 --> 12:24.500
No. Don't you get it?

12:24.500 --> 12:26.400
They-they faked our deaths!

12:26.400 --> 12:28.700
They have that kind of technology.

12:28.700 --> 12:33.300
Who the hell would look for us if they thought
they'd already found our bodies? You see?

12:33.600 --> 12:36.500
They returned me, but Angela,
she's still up there...

12:36.500 --> 12:43.500
Being experimented on and I-I-I-I can't...
I don't know what to... what do I do?!

13:15.800 --> 13:17.800
Mulder?!

13:42.400 --> 13:47.100
First things first. We got to
find a way out of here.

13:47.500 --> 13:50.300
Right behind you.

13:53.900 --> 13:56.000
What the hell's going on?

13:56.000 --> 13:58.600
That was solid rock a minute ago.
Now there's nothing there.

13:58.600 --> 14:01.600
Oh, God. It's them.

14:01.800 --> 14:04.000
They're affecting your head...

14:04.000 --> 14:05.400
Maybe mine, too.

14:05.400 --> 14:09.700
- What if I can't even tell what's real?
- Wallace, let's get out of here.

14:11.000 --> 14:15.100
- Come on, Wallace.
- They're out there, man!

14:25.200 --> 14:27.200
It's them!

14:28.200 --> 14:29.800
Wallace!

14:37.200 --> 14:39.200
Mulder?!

14:48.900 --> 14:50.700
Mulder!

15:08.500 --> 15:11.000
Don't let them see you!

15:20.000 --> 15:21.500
They're gone.

15:21.500 --> 15:23.800
Yeah, for now.

15:24.500 --> 15:28.700
- Thank God, they didn't find us.
- They should have.

15:29.400 --> 15:32.200
Maybe they came for
something else.

15:45.000 --> 15:47.000
Oh, my God!

15:49.300 --> 15:51.900
Oh, my God... Angie!

15:53.100 --> 15:55.900
They brought her back.

16:01.200 --> 16:06.000
Angie, can you talk to me? Do you remember
what happened? Can you tell me?

16:06.000 --> 16:08.500
It's all fuzzy and...

16:08.500 --> 16:11.900
You were with your husband.
You were with Wallace.

16:11.900 --> 16:16.700
There was a light.
A bright light.

16:16.700 --> 16:19.800
Where was that light coming from?
From the mountain?

16:19.800 --> 16:21.700
Over Brown Mountain.

16:21.700 --> 16:26.900
There were strange lights
dancing over the peak and...

16:27.600 --> 16:31.500
...and they took me.
And Wallace, too.

16:34.200 --> 16:39.000
- And then what happened?
- Oh, just... it all went black.

16:39.000 --> 16:45.100
And when I woke up, I didn't know where
I was and I couldn't see Wallace anymore.

16:45.100 --> 16:48.100
They returned me first.

16:49.000 --> 16:54.400
This... this place that they took you to can you
describe it to me tell me what it looked like?

16:54.400 --> 16:58.600
It was white.
A white place.

16:58.600 --> 17:00.100
It was featureless.

17:00.100 --> 17:05.200
I was lying on a table
and I couldn't get up.

17:05.200 --> 17:09.300
I mean, nothing was holding me
down but I couldn't move.

17:09.300 --> 17:12.000
Were there men there?

17:12.400 --> 17:20.599
Yes, there were men standing over me
but I couldn't see their faces.

17:20.599 --> 17:23.900
Did they perform tests on you?

17:23.900 --> 17:25.599
Yes.

17:25.599 --> 17:28.099
They did tests.

17:28.099 --> 17:31.000
Terrible... tests.

17:32.700 --> 17:34.200
What?

17:35.700 --> 17:39.500
You have a, uh... you have a scar
back here on the back of your neck.

17:39.500 --> 17:43.200
- What? What scar?!
- It's fresh.

17:43.200 --> 17:46.800
- What is that?
- It's an implant. I've seen this before.

17:46.800 --> 17:51.300
Yes. The drill... I remember the drill.
I couldn't see it at first.

17:51.300 --> 17:53.800
That was the worst part.
But I could hear it...

17:53.800 --> 17:59.000
...spinning and it was coming out of
the light... oh, what did they put in me?

17:59.000 --> 18:01.900
- Is there one in me?
- No, male abductees don't usually report this.

18:01.900 --> 18:06.400
And everything she says so far is textbook
down to the last detail, except for one.

18:06.400 --> 18:07.700
What?

18:07.700 --> 18:11.000
Two skeletons we found that were identified
as yours and Angie's? I don't understand that.

18:11.000 --> 18:12.600
It doesn't make sense to me.

18:12.600 --> 18:14.500
Maybe they're like the cattle
mutilations you hear about.

18:14.500 --> 18:17.300
Maybe they're somehow related.
Maybe they're part of their tests.

18:17.300 --> 18:22.100
I had that thought but there's no precedent
for it. It's in none of the literature.

18:22.100 --> 18:24.900
Well, they didn't want
anybody to find us.

18:24.900 --> 18:29.000
I guess they didn't want you
to know the truth.

18:30.200 --> 18:32.800
We got to get out of
here right now.

18:32.800 --> 18:35.300
- Oh, no way.
- They're out there.

18:35.300 --> 18:37.200
They're always watching.

18:37.200 --> 18:40.000
If they find us, if we leave,
they'll take us again.

18:40.000 --> 18:44.700
We're leaving right now. Gather your things.
Angie, I'll help you up.

18:44.800 --> 18:46.500
They're coming.

18:46.500 --> 18:49.100
I can feel it.

18:50.800 --> 18:54.100
- They're here!
- Hide! They'll take you, too!

18:54.100 --> 18:56.500
- We've got to hide!
- No!

19:00.600 --> 19:02.600
No!

19:24.400 --> 19:26.400
- Scully...
- Mulder.

19:26.400 --> 19:29.300
Why the hell did you leave North
Carolina without telling me?

19:29.300 --> 19:30.300
Long story.

19:30.300 --> 19:33.700
You disappear and then I get a furtive
call that you're back here in D.C.?

19:33.700 --> 19:37.300
- I'm sorry. Does anybody know you're here?
- No.

19:41.200 --> 19:42.800
Scully, this is...

19:42.800 --> 19:46.500
Angela... and Wallace Schiff.

19:47.200 --> 19:51.900
- But, Mulder, it can't be.
- This is my partner, Agent Scully.

19:53.800 --> 19:58.400
- Mulder, I I.D.'d their remains myself.
- Yeah, I think you were meant to.

19:58.400 --> 20:03.800
Agent Scully, the aliens planted decoys
so you would think we were dead.

20:04.700 --> 20:06.900
The aliens?

20:11.300 --> 20:13.500
Scully, I want you to...

20:13.500 --> 20:17.400
...put aside your scientific
bias for a moment.

20:17.400 --> 20:21.700
'Cause what I'm about to tell you
is going to change your life forever.

20:21.700 --> 20:27.400
Your life, my life, the life of
everybody on this planet.

20:27.700 --> 20:28.800
Mulder...

20:28.800 --> 20:33.600
I was out there... and I found it.

20:35.100 --> 20:37.500
- What?
- The truth.

20:37.500 --> 20:39.900
This couple...

20:39.900 --> 20:45.200
They were abducted by a UFO.
The Brown Mountain lights.

20:45.800 --> 20:52.000
They took me to a white place. There were
men there. They put an implant in my neck.

20:52.900 --> 20:56.200
Just like what happened to you.

20:56.600 --> 21:02.600
Mulder, from what very little I understand about
this case, this is not what happened to me.

21:02.800 --> 21:05.000
There's more.

21:13.600 --> 21:16.000
It doesn't like the light.

21:16.600 --> 21:18.600
Who?

21:33.500 --> 21:36.400
I abducted him.

21:38.000 --> 21:40.500
It's a gray.

21:41.100 --> 21:43.700
It speaks to me.

21:44.200 --> 21:47.900
We communicate telepathically.

21:47.900 --> 21:52.000
He told me everything.

21:52.300 --> 21:56.500
- I... I can hear him!
- Yeah.

21:58.100 --> 22:01.000
Oh, my God.

22:18.100 --> 22:20.600
I, uh...

22:20.800 --> 22:24.000
I don't know what to say, Mulder.

22:24.000 --> 22:29.100
Where to begin.
I mean, you... you were right.

22:30.700 --> 22:33.400
All these years, you were right.

22:33.400 --> 22:35.800
You think so?

22:35.800 --> 22:38.900
You were right about the grays, about...

22:38.900 --> 22:42.000
About the abductions, about the UFOs...

22:42.000 --> 22:47.300
- The lights, the Brown Mountain lights...
- What about the skeletons?

22:47.900 --> 22:50.400
They were... they were fake.
They were decoys.

22:50.400 --> 22:53.500
You're buying that decoy theory?

22:53.500 --> 22:56.200
What about that organic substance
we found on the skeletons?

22:56.200 --> 23:02.700
- That goo you were so interested in?
- It was nothing. It was bog sludge.

23:04.300 --> 23:06.600
That, uh...

23:06.600 --> 23:09.200
...doesn't sound like you, Scully. It, uh...

23:09.200 --> 23:12.800
God, I can't believe you're buying this.

23:14.500 --> 23:18.900
Mulder, I'm admitting that I was wrong.

23:20.200 --> 23:23.100
Are you all right?

23:54.400 --> 23:56.600
How are you feeling?

23:58.900 --> 24:00.600
- This doesn't make any sense.
- What?

24:00.600 --> 24:04.500
These two. Their story.
Their skeletons. None of it.

24:04.500 --> 24:10.300
Mulder, if I, of all people,
can believe this then why can't you?

24:47.100 --> 24:50.700
- Did you go inside the cave?
- Yeah. I looked. It's empty.

24:51.100 --> 24:53.600
It's as if he just vanished.

24:55.600 --> 24:57.900
He's got to be around.

24:58.200 --> 25:01.500
We'll catch up to him.
I know this area pretty well.

25:01.500 --> 25:04.100
Doctor...

25:04.900 --> 25:11.100
It's more of that digestive material.
Looks like it's coming up from out of the ground.

25:24.300 --> 25:26.300
Agent Scully?

25:29.200 --> 25:32.100
I got tracks going in and out.

25:32.100 --> 25:35.000
They were only going in before.

25:35.300 --> 25:37.600
- I guess you missed him.
- How?

25:37.600 --> 25:42.000
I mean, this, this cave's not
much more than a hole in the rock.

25:42.000 --> 25:44.000
Agent Scully?

26:24.900 --> 26:29.100
The courier just arrived.
They brought your partner's charts.

26:48.800 --> 26:50.800
I'm sorry.

26:51.600 --> 26:54.800
I know it's difficult.

27:08.900 --> 27:11.300
That, um...

27:12.200 --> 27:18.000
That digestive secretion that we keep finding
could it, could it have done this to him?

27:18.000 --> 27:20.800
I'm not sure I follow.

27:20.800 --> 27:24.100
Well, it's... it's chemically similar
to gastric juices, right?

27:24.100 --> 27:28.000
I mean, maybe he fell in it or... may...
maybe it's a product of a...

27:28.000 --> 27:31.500
...of a particular vegetation
that grows in the area.

27:31.500 --> 27:37.100
That... all sounds plausible,
I guess, except for one thing.

27:39.200 --> 27:43.300
There's no sign of it
on these remains.

28:01.800 --> 28:03.900
It was...

28:03.900 --> 28:06.500
It was on the Schiffs.

28:07.300 --> 28:12.800
I just think we need to look for
the simplest explanation.

28:13.200 --> 28:16.200
The most logical.

28:17.100 --> 28:21.000
What is the most
logical explanation?

28:21.300 --> 28:24.300
I'd say we're looking at a murder...

28:24.300 --> 28:27.800
One with ritualistic overtones.

28:27.800 --> 28:31.200
I think his body was stripped
and then skeletonized.

28:31.200 --> 28:35.700
Possibly by boiling or use
of an acid solution.

28:38.200 --> 28:41.200
Don't worry, Agent.

28:41.200 --> 28:44.500
We'll take care of
the arrangements.

28:45.200 --> 28:47.300
What arrangement?

28:47.300 --> 28:51.300
We'll have the remains
sent on to Washington.

28:54.900 --> 28:58.600
I appreciate the thoroughness
of your report.

28:58.600 --> 29:01.700
Especially given the circumstances.

29:01.700 --> 29:05.900
It might be best if you took some
time off-- a short leave.

29:09.500 --> 29:11.500
Agent?

29:12.200 --> 29:14.100
Sir?

29:15.200 --> 29:18.400
You're satisfied with my
conclusions in this case?

29:18.400 --> 29:20.900
Absolutely.

29:21.600 --> 29:25.200
- I take it you're not.
- Well...

29:26.200 --> 29:30.300
I was unable to determine
a clear cause of death...

29:30.300 --> 29:34.800
...nor was I able to fully account for
the condition of Agent Mulder's body.

29:34.800 --> 29:38.200
You concluded he was a victim
of a ritual killing.

29:38.200 --> 29:40.200
No.

29:40.200 --> 29:45.400
I mean that was one possible
scenario that I mentioned, but...

29:45.400 --> 29:49.500
...in my mind it, it, it was the
least plausible.

29:49.500 --> 29:54.400
Not only is it plausible, it's,
it's, uh... it's likely.

29:54.900 --> 29:58.400
Why are you questioning
your own findings?

29:58.900 --> 30:02.800
My role in the X-Files has
always been to provide a...

30:02.800 --> 30:08.000
...a rational scientific perspective to cases
that would seem to defy explanation...

30:08.000 --> 30:10.400
...a counterpoint to Agent Mulder.

30:10.400 --> 30:13.900
And you have done that.
You have performed admirably.

30:13.900 --> 30:15.600
Have I?

30:15.600 --> 30:23.300
How many X-Files has my scientific
approach fully and satisfactorily explained?

30:23.400 --> 30:26.900
Your reports have consistently made
sense of his conclusions.

30:26.900 --> 30:30.800
Sir, this one makes no sense at all!

30:31.700 --> 30:35.900
Are you suggesting this is
anything other than a murder?

30:35.900 --> 30:40.400
That's what Agent Mulder
would have thought.

30:41.300 --> 30:44.300
You think he would have
been right?

30:48.700 --> 30:52.800
Given Mulder's life work it's tempting to
attribute his death to the paranormal, ...

30:52.800 --> 30:56.800
...the unexplained, the unknown but
that's simply not the case here.

30:56.800 --> 31:02.600
You need to see this for what
it is and given that, ...

31:02.600 --> 31:07.700
...I promise you we'll get the
bastard who did this.

32:08.900 --> 32:11.000
I'm sorry.

32:27.900 --> 32:31.600
Agent Scully... How are you holding up?

32:31.600 --> 32:34.200
I, uh...

32:34.200 --> 32:37.400
- I still can't believe it.
- Neither can we.

32:37.400 --> 32:40.600
I half expect Mulder to
come knocking at that door.

32:40.600 --> 32:43.000
"Surprise"

32:43.000 --> 32:46.700
- This will dull the pain.
- No, thank you.

32:51.700 --> 32:54.600
Just so you know...

32:56.100 --> 32:59.800
We've launched our
own investigation.

33:00.400 --> 33:03.900
I was beginning to think that I was the
only one who was a little suspicious.

33:03.900 --> 33:07.700
We'll find him. We'll find him,
and we'll make him pay.

33:07.700 --> 33:11.300
- Find who?
- The son of a bitch who killed Mulder.

33:11.300 --> 33:15.300
I hope you're not offended but we, uh,
managed to get ahold of your report.

33:15.300 --> 33:18.300
I must say, we were impressed
by the thoroughness of it.

33:18.300 --> 33:20.600
Especially given the circumstances.

33:20.600 --> 33:23.700
- I don't understand.
- We concur with your findings.

33:23.700 --> 33:26.800
Clearly, this was a
ritualistic murder.

33:26.800 --> 33:29.500
Those were not my findings.

33:29.500 --> 33:32.800
You guys believe that, too,
that Mulder was murdered?

33:32.800 --> 33:37.200
- It's the obvious answer.
- No, it is not the obvious answer!

33:38.300 --> 33:44.000
We believe his body was stripped then skeletonized,
possibly by boiling or the use of an acid solution.

33:44.000 --> 33:45.800
We'll make that monkey pay.

33:45.800 --> 33:48.700
What the hell is wrong
with everybody?!

33:48.700 --> 33:54.400
You guys, there are unanswered questions here!
Am I the only one that's asking them?!

33:57.500 --> 33:59.500
I could use a drink.

34:00.900 --> 34:02.900
You three, of all people!

34:02.900 --> 34:06.500
You should be all over this,
not buying the party line!

34:06.500 --> 34:12.199
Look, something else is going on here!
Am I the only one who thinks that?!

34:13.000 --> 34:15.600
Are you all right?

34:22.000 --> 34:24.699
I think you need to go
home and get some rest.

34:24.699 --> 34:26.900
I'll call you a cab.

34:26.900 --> 34:29.800
- What have you done with him?!
- Scully, you're emotionally distraught.

34:29.800 --> 34:33.400
- You need to calm down and get some rest.
- Where is Mulder? Where is he?

34:33.400 --> 34:35.000
What have you done with him?!

34:35.000 --> 34:37.800
Listen to me. He's gone.
You need to accept that.

34:37.800 --> 34:40.199
Look, something else is
going on here!

34:40.199 --> 34:41.600
Where is he?!

34:41.600 --> 34:44.300
Where's Mulder?!

35:18.800 --> 35:20.800
Scully.

35:30.900 --> 35:35.800
We were in the cave when
the light came.

35:36.000 --> 35:40.800
It was a blinding
blue-white light.

35:42.100 --> 35:45.000
Then they took me.

35:45.500 --> 35:47.700
I was abducted.

35:47.700 --> 35:50.800
I found myself in some kind
of medical bay.

35:50.800 --> 35:53.500
It was white, featureless.

35:53.500 --> 35:56.900
- It was just as the Schiffs had described it.
- Mulder, the Schiffs are dead.

35:56.900 --> 35:59.200
No, actually, they're not.

35:59.200 --> 36:04.300
Mulder, their remains were
discovered in a field.

36:04.300 --> 36:08.400
That's... that's what brought us
to this case in the first place.

36:08.400 --> 36:11.300
I found your remains in
that same field.

36:11.300 --> 36:15.100
Look at me.
I'm here.

36:15.100 --> 36:17.200
How did you get here?

36:17.200 --> 36:20.200
Aliens brought me back here.

36:20.200 --> 36:24.600
From North Carolina direct
to your apartment door?

36:27.000 --> 36:30.900
Mulder, you don't remember
getting here, do you?

36:32.600 --> 36:35.300
Neither do I.

36:35.300 --> 36:37.900
It doesn't change what happened.

36:37.900 --> 36:41.900
Mulder, why did you knock?
This is your apartment.

36:41.900 --> 36:46.200
And you don't seem the least bit
surprised to find me here.

36:46.200 --> 36:48.600
And what about the Schiffs?

36:48.600 --> 36:53.800
I mean, if they're alive,
as you say, then...

36:54.500 --> 36:57.500
Then where are they?
Where'd they go?

36:57.500 --> 37:00.600
Mulder, five minutes ago...

37:00.600 --> 37:04.000
...this room was filled with
people attending your wake.

37:04.000 --> 37:07.000
Well, what can I say, Scully?
I'm here. I'm real.

37:07.000 --> 37:09.500
Mulder, this is not reality.

37:09.500 --> 37:11.800
This is a hallucination.
It has to be.

37:11.800 --> 37:15.400
And either I am having it, or you are
having it or we are having it together.

37:15.400 --> 37:17.000
Brought on by what?

37:17.000 --> 37:22.700
Something that we found in that field,
Mulder, because that's where it began.

37:24.100 --> 37:26.700
Wild mushroom.

37:26.700 --> 37:32.300
Wild mushrooms, Mulder. They were growing there.
I stepped on one, and it gave off spores.

37:32.300 --> 37:36.700
Several varieties of... of mushrooms are
known for their hallucinogenic properties.

37:36.700 --> 37:40.500
- If... if we inhaled it...
- Whatever happened to the most logical explanation?

37:40.500 --> 37:42.400
This is it, Mulder.

37:42.400 --> 37:45.600
What if we're still there?
If we're still in that cave...

37:45.600 --> 37:50.800
...in North Carolina. That we're not here
in this apartment right now.

37:50.800 --> 37:52.800
Whoa, Scully.

37:52.800 --> 37:55.500
No, Mulder, bear with me.
I think this is making sense.

37:55.500 --> 38:01.700
I think that Angela and Wallace Schiff were digested
by that substance that I found all over that field.

38:01.700 --> 38:05.800
That they were dissolved and then
expelled up out of the ground.

38:05.800 --> 38:11.300
What if that substance and this hallucinogen
are-are from one and the same organism?

38:11.300 --> 38:12.800
A giant mushroom?

38:12.800 --> 38:16.200
A giant fungal organism, Mulder.
We already know that they exist.

38:16.200 --> 38:22.000
Biologists have found specimens that range
dozens of acres that weigh hundreds of tons.

38:22.000 --> 38:24.900
And what if this one needs to
feed on living tissue, Mulder?

38:24.900 --> 38:30.200
There is carnivorous plant life. There's... there's
the Venus Flytrap and the pitcher plant.

38:30.200 --> 38:36.300
- Mulder, what if this one puts off an hallucinogen...
- To lure its prey into the cave?

38:36.600 --> 38:41.900
To make it complacent.
To keep it still while it devours it.

38:43.200 --> 38:46.000
What if we're still
underground, Mulder?

38:46.000 --> 38:48.900
What if we're moving
deeper into the cave?

38:48.900 --> 38:51.600
Or being moved?

38:51.600 --> 38:55.000
Mulder, what if we're
being digested?

38:57.200 --> 38:59.200
Right now.

39:55.900 --> 39:59.300
The exact size of this organism
has yet to be determined?

39:59.300 --> 40:02.000
That's correct, sir.

40:03.300 --> 40:07.400
We know that the organism extends
for at least ten acres.

40:07.400 --> 40:10.800
Though it's mostly subterranean
so it may be far larger.

40:10.800 --> 40:13.100
We've contacted Fish and Wildlife.

40:13.100 --> 40:16.700
We've contacted the North Carolina State
Health Department as well as the...

40:16.700 --> 40:18.900
...local FBI field office in Raleigh.

40:18.900 --> 40:22.300
And we've contacted a mycologist at
the Smithsonian for good measure.

40:22.300 --> 40:24.200
We think we have our bases covered.

40:24.200 --> 40:29.500
The lab results determined that the
spores we were exposed to...

40:29.500 --> 40:32.900
...have a chemical structure
similar to LSD.

40:32.900 --> 40:39.800
They also contain an alkaloid
which induces a state of narcosis.

40:40.300 --> 40:44.800
It's a rare day when the two of you
sign off on the same report.

40:49.900 --> 40:52.700
Agent Mulder?

40:52.700 --> 40:55.100
I'm just thinking...

40:55.100 --> 40:59.400
I'm not exactly clear on
how we escaped.

40:59.400 --> 41:01.400
What's not clear?

41:01.400 --> 41:06.900
Once you recognized that we were under a
chemical influence then it simply kind of...

41:06.900 --> 41:08.800
...broke its spell?

41:08.800 --> 41:09.900
That's right.

41:09.900 --> 41:15.100
Scully, how could we simply will ourselves
out of a chemical hallucination?

41:15.100 --> 41:17.400
Well, the fact remains we did.

41:17.400 --> 41:18.900
Did we?

41:18.900 --> 41:23.500
Can you name me one drug that loses its effect
once the user realizes it's in his system?

41:23.500 --> 41:26.800
I assume the effects wore off to the point that
you were both able to make your escape.

41:26.800 --> 41:30.200
Scully, how long were we underground?
Hours? Half a day?

41:30.200 --> 41:33.900
How come our bodies don't show any effects
of being burned by the digestive fluids?

41:33.900 --> 41:37.800
We were covered in hydrochloric acid.
Yet look at our skin. Nothing.

41:37.800 --> 41:40.000
Agent Mulder, where are you
going with this?

41:40.000 --> 41:41.700
Scully...

41:41.700 --> 41:44.400
We never escaped.

41:45.200 --> 41:48.500
We're still trapped underground.

41:48.900 --> 41:52.000
Mulder, we did escape.

41:52.700 --> 41:55.800
I think you're suffering from
post-traumatic stress.

41:55.800 --> 41:57.700
No, I'm not.

41:57.700 --> 42:02.000
This is not real.
You, you're not real.

42:02.000 --> 42:03.200
Mulder, I...

42:03.200 --> 42:05.900
I'll prove it, Scully.

42:06.800 --> 42:08.800
Mulder!

43:10.400 --> 43:12.500
Over here!
Over here!

43:14.800 --> 43:16.800
He's alive.

43:17.000 --> 43:18.500
Hurry up!

43:19.500 --> 43:22.100
Get him out! Get him out!

43:30.700 --> 43:32.800
Keep digging!
She's down here!

43:34.900 --> 43:37.400
Pull her up.
Get her out.

43:49.800 --> 43:52.600
- Mushroom.
- We found it.

43:55.200 --> 43:57.200
Just take it easy, Agent.
