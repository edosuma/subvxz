Oh, good. You're up already.

00:14.139 --> 00:16.934
We're meeting Manager Kim in half an hour.

00:17.601 --> 00:21.396
Listen to him. You still have
a lot to learn about the business.

00:21.479 --> 00:22.439
Mother...

00:22.522 --> 00:24.984
After that, we have a meeting
on the 15th floor.

00:25.108 --> 00:28.153
You're going to have to speak
to the board about Ga-in.

00:28.445 --> 00:30.948
We need to address the issue
before it becomes a problem.

00:31.031 --> 00:31.991
Mother!

All of this is...

entirely...

00:44.252 --> 00:45.545
I quit.

00:48.007 --> 00:49.592
Don't be ridiculous.

00:50.383 --> 00:53.136
You can't go back on something
that's been decided.

02:04.083 --> 02:06.459
I'm a... television character!

02:07.544 --> 02:08.921
And kind of a jerk!

02:09.004 --> 02:11.006
Yeah, but, like, the total fan favorite.

02:11.422 --> 02:13.424
What am I supposed to do?

02:13.884 --> 02:15.260
Do? What do you mean?

02:15.719 --> 02:19.514
I... I’m not me.
I don’t even know what I am.

02:19.597 --> 02:22.101
No, you’re you. Of course you’re you.

02:22.183 --> 02:24.269
Yeah, but I’m also, like, six other dudes.

02:24.352 --> 02:26.730
Yeah. No! I mean, no, look.

02:27.355 --> 02:31.484
You’re Park Joon
and this series is almost over, right?

02:32.402 --> 02:33.570
I guess.

02:33.654 --> 02:37.074
So as long as this has a happy ending,
you’ll wake up

02:37.157 --> 02:41.578
a different person, in a different drama,
and start the whole thing over again.

02:41.870 --> 02:45.958
But why? Why can't I just be me?

02:48.585 --> 02:52.715
Because right now... we need a hero.

Seo-yeon.

02:59.512 --> 03:00.513
Yes, sir.

03:00.764 --> 03:04.059
Please, just call me Seth.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.021
Could you come out for a minute?

03:07.980 --> 03:09.397
Of course.

03:10.858 --> 03:12.151
Then...

03:22.535 --> 03:24.872
Seth, what is all this?

03:26.623 --> 03:28.625
I just wanted to thank you.

03:28.834 --> 03:31.045
For stepping in when I needed you.

Do you remember?

04:58.506 --> 05:03.220
We both started working with Chef Park
so it's already been a few months.

05:04.387 --> 05:07.850
Well, that was just coincidence.

05:08.433 --> 05:10.853
I don't believe in coincidences.

05:10.936 --> 05:12.271
Neither do I.

05:13.354 --> 05:17.317
The fire that day,
and our working together here...

05:18.068 --> 05:20.737
All of it made me feel like
we're old friends.

05:21.654 --> 05:23.698
Like we've always been close.

05:28.578 --> 05:32.498
I want to be someone special to you.

Oh, Seth’s like me, but I...

06:30.140 --> 06:32.017
I'm new. I mean, Seth’s been in

06:32.100 --> 06:34.560
dozens of dramas.
He’s way better at it than I am.

But there’s no such thing as coincidence
in Dramaworld.

See, everything is manipulated.

No, no, not me. I'm not from here though.

Something’s been really off
since your dad was murdered.

We've been trying to figure out what.

06:49.201 --> 06:50.910
I thought it was Ga-in, but...

06:51.286 --> 06:54.081
I guess not. She was pretty evil.

She's dead.

I really need to go and prepare. Thanks.

08:14.453 --> 08:15.703
Yes, sir.

It says here that "you’re not supposed to
get emotionally involved with characters

08:26.797 --> 08:28.925
because it could compromise the drama."

08:29.009 --> 08:32.720
I have been doing everything in my power
to get you and Seo-yeon together.

If you'd just saved her at the restaurant
when I gave you the chance!

am I still?

Anyway, it doesn't matter.

I mean...

09:36.993 --> 09:38.328
Dramaworld brought me here

who wasn't going to be a character so...

I doubt that.

09:50.298 --> 09:51.716
No.

that was on the other side.
