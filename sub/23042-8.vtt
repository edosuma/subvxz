<i>It was that old-ass man that broke</i>

00:15.851 --> 00:17.151
<i>into our stash house
and took our guns.</i>

00:17.253 --> 00:19.353
Problem is, I put you in charge of that.

00:19.455 --> 00:21.489
Come on, bro, I gotta look

00:21.591 --> 00:23.123
<i>I wanna know how

00:23.226 --> 00:25.693

You fuck up like that again,

I'ma take your life.

00:30.861 --> 00:32.131
<i>Head nurse been
looking for you.</i>

00:32.234 --> 00:33.493
Medicine come up missing.

00:33.494 --> 00:35.235
Are you aware that we have security cameras

00:35.337 --> 00:36.436
throughout the facility?

00:38.473 --> 00:40.207
<i>Is it cool if I at
least come by the apartment</i>

00:40.309 --> 00:42.121
- <i>to get my stuff?</i>
- How's work?

00:42.413 --> 00:45.413
- I quit.
- So what are you gonna do now?

00:45.566 --> 00:47.633
I don't wanna just throw
away everything that we have.

00:48.207 --> 00:49.774
<i>Assalamu alaikum, brother.</i>

00:49.876 --> 00:50.975
My name's Rafiq.

00:51.243 --> 00:53.644
- Ronnie.
- Come by when you ready

00:53.746 --> 00:56.043
- to lay that burden down.
- Said I ain't got no burden.

00:57.755 --> 00:59.082
Everybody's got one.

01:00.055 --> 01:01.322
<i>It's how you carry it.</i>

01:01.424 --> 01:02.657
<i>What you doing here?</i>

01:02.759 --> 01:04.257
I want EJ back.

01:06.584 --> 01:08.017
<i>So how long you been
working for my brother?</i>

01:08.119 --> 01:09.874
- About six months.
- And?

01:10.888 --> 01:12.554
<i>I mean, he's your brother.</i>

01:12.656 --> 01:14.587
- Sonny?
- Hey.

01:33.375 --> 01:36.042
Yeah, why don't you come
sit your bitch ass down?

01:45.327 --> 01:46.365
Yup.

02:07.207 --> 02:09.339
So what is it you'd like to talk about?

02:09.442 --> 02:11.438
I wanna talk about the guns you took.

02:11.644 --> 02:15.136
Ah. Well, see, I had asked Trice a question

02:15.882 --> 02:18.572
which he then decided not to answer.

02:19.919 --> 02:20.993
So...

02:21.788 --> 02:23.554
you think I've got his attention now?

02:23.656 --> 02:25.155
You know, he fucked me up real bad

02:25.257 --> 02:26.623
because of your punk ass.

02:26.725 --> 02:29.677
Well, you did fuck up.

02:30.809 --> 02:33.006
Shit, you're lucky.

02:33.398 --> 02:34.806
Back in the day,

02:34.954 --> 02:37.588
I would've curbed your ass
right in front of your old lady.

02:37.690 --> 02:39.557
- Is that right?
- Yes, and then I would've

02:39.659 --> 02:42.092
fucked her for good measure.

02:43.529 --> 02:46.899
But shit's a little
different these days, I guess.

02:47.966 --> 02:49.605
You think this a fuckin' game?

02:50.035 --> 02:51.535
What else is it?

02:54.275 --> 02:55.356
So...

02:56.642 --> 02:59.105
you gonna do what your
boss asked you or what?

03:00.845 --> 03:02.277
Fuck you.

03:02.379 --> 03:03.605
Shit.

03:04.048 --> 03:06.682
No, fuck you, rookie.

03:06.784 --> 03:08.380
Shit.

03:09.153 --> 03:10.519
Sonny, Sonny, you okay?

03:13.677 --> 03:16.212
I cannot believe we let this jive turkey

03:16.313 --> 03:18.918
get the drop on both of us.

03:19.649 --> 03:21.149
Oh, stop fuckin' around, Sonny.

03:21.251 --> 03:23.606
I'm a long way from fuckin' around.

03:44.627 --> 03:46.598
- Get out.
- Oh, brother, what the...

03:46.598 --> 03:47.898
Don't "brother" me.

03:48.274 --> 03:51.241
I want you and this piece of fuckin' trash

03:51.343 --> 03:54.017
- out of my establishment.
- All right.

03:55.000 --> 03:58.200
Okay. I just need to call
Tep and JB, all right?

03:58.926 --> 04:00.537
But you need to put that gun down.

04:00.640 --> 04:01.956
You not hearing me.

04:02.556 --> 04:04.225
I want you gone!

04:06.547 --> 04:08.379
You should've never come back.

04:25.171 --> 04:27.765
Damn, girl. Can I get a minute?

04:31.922 --> 04:33.369
The fuck wrong with you?

04:33.799 --> 04:36.006
I get you that cell phone
and this shit happens?

04:36.108 --> 04:38.642
I don't got it. Cops do.

04:38.965 --> 04:40.176
Cops?

04:40.547 --> 04:42.213
That shit better not come back on me.

04:42.315 --> 04:43.514
It won't.

04:45.321 --> 04:48.365
- I need another, man.
- Oh, shit.

04:49.289 --> 04:50.491
Five dollars.

04:50.891 --> 04:52.528
The last one was three.

04:52.949 --> 04:54.448
This one's five.

04:55.953 --> 04:58.379
Shit, well, this all I got, man.

04:59.831 --> 05:01.499
Give me the shit, man.

05:03.010 --> 05:05.057
Oh, shit.

05:05.670 --> 05:08.544
Jean! This motherfucker need a doctor.

05:12.945 --> 05:16.096
- He need poultice.
- No, fuck all that voodoo shit.

05:16.647 --> 05:18.414
- Where Chauncy at?
- Sleepin'.

05:18.516 --> 05:19.964
Wake his ass up.

05:20.351 --> 05:22.274
We need his doctorization skills.

05:26.865 --> 05:28.865
Shit, man. Look at this shit.

05:33.170 --> 05:35.437
You ever been to the Dells?

05:37.374 --> 05:39.637
- No.
- Up in Wisconsin.

05:40.280 --> 05:42.519
It's beautiful as shit.

05:43.118 --> 05:44.664
If you like walking in the woods,

05:44.664 --> 05:46.297
that's the place to do it.

05:46.399 --> 05:48.711
Well, I never walked in the woods.

05:49.969 --> 05:51.001
Fuck are you talking about?

05:51.104 --> 05:52.536
Everybody walk in the woods.

05:52.638 --> 05:56.055
Not me. But I walked in the desert, though.

05:57.270 --> 05:58.395
For what?

05:59.509 --> 06:00.794
I was a soldier.

06:02.014 --> 06:04.281
Yeah, I saw some shit, too, man,

06:04.879 --> 06:07.009
I still can't unsee.

06:07.925 --> 06:11.178
I seen some shit in the
Dells. It was dope as fuck.

06:11.930 --> 06:15.098
I seen this little deer biting on a bush.

06:15.200 --> 06:17.916
And it was chewing like
this. Weird-ass little chew.

06:18.703 --> 06:21.471
And then there was rain,
but it wasn't like rain-rain.

06:21.768 --> 06:24.190
It was like a light, magical mist

06:24.258 --> 06:25.815
falling out of the sky.

06:26.110 --> 06:27.915
All of a sudden, a fuckin' frog

06:28.643 --> 06:30.377
landed on my boot.

06:30.581 --> 06:32.981
And more frogs just
kept jumping out, right?

06:33.084 --> 06:34.816
It was like a frog party.
They was everywhere.

06:34.918 --> 06:36.185
They was singing and shit.

06:36.287 --> 06:37.669
Freaked me out.

06:37.989 --> 06:41.056
All of a sudden, fuckin'
crows just came out of the sky.

06:41.291 --> 06:43.458
Start picking these frogs up...

06:43.560 --> 06:45.955
and eating the fuck out of them.

06:46.262 --> 06:47.595
And at first, I'm
looking at this shit like,

06:47.697 --> 06:49.270
"Man, this is fucked up."

06:49.566 --> 06:51.630
But the frogs was chill as shit.

06:53.269 --> 06:55.136
Seemed like they ain't even care.

06:57.607 --> 07:00.317
That's... that's when I figured it out.

07:02.411 --> 07:03.576
What?

07:05.880 --> 07:07.747
That it's good to be a crow.

07:09.184 --> 07:10.650
What about the deer?

07:10.752 --> 07:12.486
Man, no. Fuck that deer.

07:12.588 --> 07:15.630
Just nibble on a little piece of shrubbery.

07:17.358 --> 07:19.258
Yo, can you fix this motherfucker?

07:20.027 --> 07:21.910
- What for?
- What for?

07:22.663 --> 07:24.819
'Cause you took a oath to help people.

07:25.333 --> 07:27.032
And this man right here needs help.

07:28.603 --> 07:30.527
And as a medical practitioner,

07:30.823 --> 07:33.118
it's your duty to help him.

07:35.739 --> 07:36.771
One now.

07:37.934 --> 07:39.780
I'll give you the rest if you fix him.

07:46.643 --> 07:48.245
Let me see.

07:55.318 --> 07:56.550
Ballistic trauma?

07:56.652 --> 07:58.252
We know what the fuck it is.

07:58.756 --> 08:00.053
Can you fix him up?

08:10.494 --> 08:11.673
Morning.

08:12.495 --> 08:14.094
Girl, how long you been
standing right there?

08:14.195 --> 08:16.428
- I just got here.
- It's kinda creepy.

08:17.637 --> 08:19.673
- How'd you sleep?
- Fuckin' terrible.

08:20.040 --> 08:21.706
This couch hard as shit.

08:21.808 --> 08:23.641
- You picked it.
- Yeah, because it looked good,

08:23.743 --> 08:25.909
not because I thought
I'd actually be sleeping

08:26.012 --> 08:27.678
on this motherfucker.

08:29.075 --> 08:31.182
Hmm. You hungry?

08:32.418 --> 08:33.934
Yeah, I'll make us something.

08:34.287 --> 08:35.553
I got it.

08:36.220 --> 08:37.554
It's no big deal, really.

08:37.657 --> 08:39.282
That's why I got it.

08:40.225 --> 08:41.957
- Bowls. Uh-oh, here we go.
- Sit.

08:42.059 --> 08:44.102
Fancy.

08:45.999 --> 08:47.651
You're such a hater.

08:52.624 --> 08:54.323
So about us, J, what we doing?

08:54.426 --> 08:55.453
Brandon.

08:57.962 --> 08:58.994
For real.

09:01.633 --> 09:03.999
I mean, I told you, all
that stuff is in my past.

09:04.101 --> 09:05.768
It's over. It's done.

09:05.870 --> 09:07.474
It's never coming back.

09:08.373 --> 09:10.021
That's why you quit your job?

09:12.857 --> 09:14.173
I told you what happened.

09:14.411 --> 09:15.777
We talked about this.

09:15.879 --> 09:17.612
All you wanted was to
get on that line at work

09:17.714 --> 09:20.154
and get some experience under your belt.

09:21.231 --> 09:23.285
And then you just quit like that?

09:23.387 --> 09:24.452
I'm talkin' about us right now.

09:24.554 --> 09:25.820
And so am I.

09:33.127 --> 09:34.742
Do you have something figured out?

09:39.955 --> 09:42.727
Every-everything cost money, J, okay?

09:43.383 --> 09:46.418
What? It would be nice to
start something of my own.

09:46.520 --> 09:48.040
A food truck, something.

09:49.388 --> 09:51.071
But I don't have the money for that.

09:51.390 --> 09:54.758
You would if you sign
those papers for the house.

09:56.629 --> 09:58.261
What, you think your mom
not gon' sell the house

09:58.363 --> 09:59.705
because you don't sign?

10:00.065 --> 10:02.672
- She can't.
- That's not right, Brandon.

10:04.870 --> 10:07.670
Y'all need to talk, 'cause
I have a big inspection

10:07.772 --> 10:09.986
- at the house today.
- Really?

10:09.986 --> 10:11.034
Yes.

10:12.047 --> 10:14.080
There's this investor who's
bought some other properties

10:14.182 --> 10:16.884
in the area, and he just made an offer.

10:19.573 --> 10:21.800
Look, your mother is trying
to have a fresh start.

10:22.279 --> 10:24.221
And it's a chance for you to do the same.

10:37.890 --> 10:38.989
What up, fool?

10:39.091 --> 10:40.590
Man, turn that shit down.

10:40.692 --> 10:43.059
My whittling music? It's important because

10:43.161 --> 10:45.327
I'm making something special for my moms.

10:45.609 --> 10:47.630
Whatever. We gotta talk about Jake.

10:47.732 --> 10:49.091
<i>What he do now?</i>

10:50.168 --> 10:51.901
He brung that piece to the roller rink.

10:52.003 --> 10:54.224
Yeah. That was messed up.

10:54.706 --> 10:56.229
We gotta do something about it.

10:56.407 --> 10:58.106
<i>Well, I been
praying for him.</i>

10:58.208 --> 10:59.975
Even whittled a cross for him.

11:00.077 --> 11:01.789
<i>Man, he don't need no cross.</i>

11:02.345 --> 11:04.245
<i>How 'bout y'all come
over to my crib,</i>

11:04.347 --> 11:05.614
we game it up a little bit,

11:05.639 --> 11:07.338
and then we talk to him about it?

11:07.841 --> 11:10.008
- Now? <i>
- Yeah. Why?</i>

11:11.121 --> 11:13.921
This is sorta my... me time.

11:14.023 --> 11:15.890
Motherfucker, get your ass over here,

11:15.915 --> 11:17.180
and bring Jake.

11:18.928 --> 11:20.029
Morning.

11:23.378 --> 11:24.532
You okay?

11:25.046 --> 11:26.936
Huh? Yeah. Yeah, I'm good.

11:27.682 --> 11:29.293
Thought maybe you'd be upset,

11:29.731 --> 11:31.819
Tiffany taking EJ back like that.

11:33.134 --> 11:35.367
I mean, it's not normal for a mother

11:35.469 --> 11:37.030
to just leave her child.

11:37.805 --> 11:39.873
Do you know if she's even
okay to take care of him?

11:39.912 --> 11:41.140
Ma, she's fine.

11:41.241 --> 11:42.374
I mean, she be on some crazy stuff,

11:42.476 --> 11:43.700
but she fine.

11:44.278 --> 11:45.610
Did you work something out with her?

11:45.713 --> 11:46.979
Ma, this is, like, the first day

11:47.081 --> 11:49.113
in, like, two weeks where I don't

11:49.215 --> 11:51.382
have to push a stroller, I'm off work.

11:51.484 --> 11:53.284
Like, I just wanna take a little vacay.

11:53.386 --> 11:55.153
- Let me enjoy it.
- Oh, vacay.

11:55.254 --> 11:58.047
- Yes.
- He's your boy, not a job.

12:01.729 --> 12:02.761
What?

12:04.164 --> 12:05.589
All right, look.

12:05.898 --> 12:08.343
He's both, all right? I love him to death.

12:08.533 --> 12:10.767
But I need a break. All right?

12:10.792 --> 12:12.492
He was just warming up to you, Emmett.

12:14.707 --> 12:16.272
You know, when I had you,

12:16.374 --> 12:18.093
all my friends were having a good time.

12:18.811 --> 12:19.900
All of 'em.

12:20.679 --> 12:23.245
And I was home changing your diapers.

12:24.849 --> 12:26.211
And I don't regret it.

12:26.796 --> 12:28.012
Not one bit.

12:29.721 --> 12:32.374
Neither will you if you
stay consistent in his life.

12:33.390 --> 12:35.160
All right.

12:35.893 --> 12:37.151
Thank you.

12:37.428 --> 12:38.888
I'll go check on him.

12:40.330 --> 12:41.429
Can I have my phone back?

12:41.813 --> 12:43.172
I guess.

12:44.067 --> 12:45.666
So you not going to work today?

12:45.769 --> 12:47.649
No. I got let go.

12:48.805 --> 12:51.310
What happened?

12:52.408 --> 12:54.189
Nothing you need to worry about.

12:55.745 --> 12:58.011
Place was screwing me out of my hours.

12:59.448 --> 13:01.548
I guess there's something
better for me out there.

13:01.650 --> 13:02.727
Okay.

13:03.619 --> 13:05.039
I mean, you-you sure?

13:05.287 --> 13:06.675
Mm-hmm.

13:09.532 --> 13:11.608
- Check on your boy.
- I am.

13:41.789 --> 13:43.357
Thank you, baby.

13:44.524 --> 13:45.731
You're welcome.

13:46.715 --> 13:48.181
I'm sorry it took so long, Ma.

13:48.283 --> 13:50.050
- I...
- I get it. I get it. No, I...

13:50.152 --> 13:51.839
You grew up here. So did I.

13:56.284 --> 13:57.683
So did Coogie.

13:58.255 --> 13:59.859
Hey, where my tea tree oil at?

14:01.629 --> 14:02.929
Yeah, I'm looking at you, son.

14:03.031 --> 14:04.451
I got some shave bumps I gotta soothe.

14:04.451 --> 14:05.850
You check next to your yogurt?

14:05.953 --> 14:07.185
Now, why the hell would I do that?

14:07.287 --> 14:08.720
He just foolin' with you, baby.

14:08.822 --> 14:11.544
I ain't got time for fun.
The inspector's coming.

14:12.564 --> 14:14.067
That's why y'all getting dressed up?

14:14.067 --> 14:16.634
Well, unlike you, I like to
make a good first impression.

14:16.736 --> 14:18.979
Brandon signed the papers
for the house, baby.

14:18.980 --> 14:20.479
Well, it's about time.

14:20.582 --> 14:23.481
Your oil is on the dresser,
right where you left it.

14:25.485 --> 14:26.719
And if you gonna stay for the inspection,

14:26.821 --> 14:28.616
you need to get cleaned up, okay?

14:29.156 --> 14:30.789
Y'all are really taking this serious.

14:30.891 --> 14:32.925
I don't think that the
inspector's gonna care

14:33.027 --> 14:34.459
- what you have on, Mom.
- You know,

14:34.561 --> 14:36.494
if I didn't get Greavy to dress up,

14:36.597 --> 14:38.529
he'd be walking around here
with his nuts swinging out

14:38.631 --> 14:40.331
- beneath his shorts, shit.
- Oh, no.

14:40.433 --> 14:42.466
See, now it's time for me to go.

14:42.568 --> 14:43.774
Bye, Mom.

14:43.970 --> 14:45.236
I'll see you later.

14:45.338 --> 14:47.538
- Where you going?
- To Hannibal's.

14:47.947 --> 14:49.380
What you all up to now?

14:49.482 --> 14:50.533
You'll see.

14:51.284 --> 14:53.851
All good things, I tell
you. All good things.

14:53.953 --> 14:55.385
Tell him he need to
stop smoking so much weed

14:55.487 --> 14:57.187
so he can remember to call his auntie.

14:57.289 --> 14:58.821
- All right.
- Yeah.

14:58.924 --> 15:00.723
- You feel better now?
- I feel better now.

15:00.825 --> 15:01.958
Mwah.

15:05.030 --> 15:07.064
- Yo, Q!
- Yeah.

15:07.499 --> 15:09.132
He getting up.

15:09.234 --> 15:10.402
Hmm.

15:12.937 --> 15:15.067
Nice place you got here, Reg.

15:15.440 --> 15:16.972
What the fuck?

15:20.178 --> 15:21.870
Reggie, Reggie, Reggie.

15:23.981 --> 15:25.747
You know, Reggie, back in my day,

15:25.849 --> 15:27.516
I used to always tell my boys

15:27.618 --> 15:30.101
never to carry their wallets with them.

15:30.287 --> 15:32.420
That way, if the shit went
south and you got grabbed...

15:32.522 --> 15:34.956
You know, by a rival or something...

15:35.058 --> 15:36.769
...they wouldn't know where you lived

15:37.727 --> 15:39.837
and your people would be safe.

15:42.532 --> 15:44.102
Who you living with, Reggie?

15:45.386 --> 15:46.441
Nobody.

15:46.466 --> 15:47.513
Nobody.

15:47.991 --> 15:50.061
And that second bedroom
in there, that's for who?

15:53.209 --> 15:54.475
It used to belong to my folks.

15:54.577 --> 15:56.243
Ah, and where are they now?

15:57.346 --> 15:59.379
Pop's doing a bid in Statesville.

15:59.482 --> 16:00.801
Ah, and Moms?

16:01.584 --> 16:03.443
- Gone.
- Mm.

16:13.394 --> 16:14.693
So what now?

16:16.164 --> 16:17.530
I'm thinking on it.

16:22.169 --> 16:24.068
- Go!
- Both of y'all trash.

16:24.171 --> 16:26.104
Don't be talkin' all that.

16:26.206 --> 16:27.439
Bro!

16:29.075 --> 16:30.808
I'm a pro at this game.
I could beat you anyway.

16:30.910 --> 16:33.011
Oh, my God, Kev, stop being a spammer.

16:33.113 --> 16:34.212
At least I ain't hackin'.

16:34.314 --> 16:35.680
Yeah, I'm hackin' your mama.

16:35.782 --> 16:37.948
Man, you just mad 'cause
I got natural talent.

16:38.050 --> 16:39.138
Whatever.

16:44.624 --> 16:46.960
So, Jake, what you been up to?

16:47.193 --> 16:48.792
Nothin'. Just hangin'.

16:48.894 --> 16:51.562
- With who?
- Reg. You know...

16:51.927 --> 16:54.060
- learnin' the game.
- Which game that?

16:54.162 --> 16:55.246
Hustlin'.

16:55.930 --> 16:57.085
Why?

16:57.946 --> 16:59.045
You serious?

17:00.835 --> 17:02.485
Look, man, we worried about you.

17:02.670 --> 17:05.131
Don't be. 'Bout to get paid.

17:05.131 --> 17:06.531
Paid doing what?

17:06.952 --> 17:08.423
Fuck. Lost.

17:09.891 --> 17:12.269
Shit. Why you two all over me?

17:12.641 --> 17:14.672
- I'm good.
- Yeah, until you're not.

17:14.772 --> 17:16.173
What the fuck that supposed to mean?

17:16.275 --> 17:17.540
Just what the fuck it sound like.

17:17.566 --> 17:18.815
We worried about you.

17:18.839 --> 17:20.219
Stanley.

17:21.769 --> 17:23.680
Did I hear that word
come out of your mouth?

17:23.781 --> 17:26.808
Yes, ma'am. I'm very sorry.
It won't happen again.

17:26.851 --> 17:28.137
I know it won't.

17:29.620 --> 17:31.353
Kevin, I need you to
run to the grocery store

17:31.456 --> 17:32.721
and get us some things.

17:32.823 --> 17:34.891
- But, Ma, I...
- Come on, Kevin.

17:38.629 --> 17:40.028
You better go before she whup you.

17:41.832 --> 17:43.566
Take your friends with you too.

17:43.667 --> 17:45.333
- Aw, man.
- Damn.

17:45.435 --> 17:46.805
There you go.

17:48.871 --> 17:50.338
Fuck is all that?

17:50.440 --> 17:52.311
Gotta keep you alive, baby.

17:58.081 --> 17:59.647
Have you done this before?

18:02.384 --> 18:03.950
- The fuck?
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

18:04.052 --> 18:06.194
Not too much. I need
some of that for later.

18:07.756 --> 18:09.152
This may hurt.

18:15.364 --> 18:17.631
Whoo!

18:18.054 --> 18:19.343
Shit.

18:24.057 --> 18:26.024
That's some MacGyver shit right there.

18:32.332 --> 18:34.275
Wow.

18:37.871 --> 18:39.281
That should hold.

18:39.606 --> 18:41.182
Your body'll do the rest.

18:41.244 --> 18:42.642
My man!

18:43.123 --> 18:45.144
- Pills.
- Still got it, huh?

18:46.261 --> 18:47.791
Relax, man.

18:51.408 --> 18:52.697
I think you got a problem.

19:07.985 --> 19:10.531
Miss Ethel? Miss Ethel.

19:11.678 --> 19:14.082
- Miss Ethel.
- What day is it?

19:14.665 --> 19:16.245
Is today your day?

19:16.245 --> 19:18.245
Never mind that. You got
something on the stove?

19:18.628 --> 19:19.732
Oh.

19:21.451 --> 19:22.884
Jeez, oh.

19:27.823 --> 19:28.844
Ooh.

19:30.826 --> 19:31.952
Ah, sh...

19:31.977 --> 19:33.076
Fuck.

19:40.435 --> 19:42.269
You didn't smell that burning in here?

19:42.370 --> 19:44.169
I must've dozed off for a minute.

19:44.169 --> 19:46.769
You could've burned this whole
house down, with you in it.

19:47.035 --> 19:48.823
Corn bread's ruined.

19:49.250 --> 19:51.416
Where's Ronnie? He should
be helping you with this.

19:51.440 --> 19:52.687
Haven't seen him.

19:53.688 --> 19:55.242
Did you take your medication?

19:56.490 --> 19:57.575
Did you eat?

19:58.490 --> 19:59.660
Miss Ethel.

20:23.645 --> 20:24.797
Here.

20:29.351 --> 20:32.168
Look, um, I gotta go now, okay?

20:32.788 --> 20:35.221
Well, if I don't go to glory in my sleep,

20:35.323 --> 20:36.889
I'll see you tomorrow.

20:37.536 --> 20:39.859
Go on, now. Stop milking the clock.

20:45.666 --> 20:48.614
Listen, Miss Ethel, I need to talk to you.

20:50.771 --> 20:52.270
I came over here to...

20:52.310 --> 20:53.908
Well, if it's about my medication,

20:54.128 --> 20:55.447
don't waste your breath.

20:55.709 --> 20:58.710
'Cause I came up with a new
system to help me remember.

21:04.018 --> 21:05.463
No, it's church.

21:06.386 --> 21:09.953
You been asking me, and
I'm finally ready to go.

21:10.291 --> 21:11.267
Good.

21:11.292 --> 21:12.491
It's never too late

21:12.593 --> 21:13.525
to get right with Jesus.

21:13.628 --> 21:14.941
Yeah.

21:15.964 --> 21:18.369
Okay, well, we'll talk
about it tomorrow, okay?

21:18.867 --> 21:20.233
- Okay.
- All right.

21:20.334 --> 21:21.868
I put some soup on the counter.

21:21.970 --> 21:23.678
Just make sure you heat
it up when you ready.

21:24.355 --> 21:25.947
You get some rest, okay?

21:26.874 --> 21:28.006
Okay.

21:29.542 --> 21:31.314
- Bye.
- Bye.

21:34.266 --> 21:35.385
Meds.

21:36.984 --> 21:39.450
Hey, man, do me a favor and,
uh, spray my babies over here.

21:39.552 --> 21:41.007
- All right.
- Hey, babies.

21:41.588 --> 21:42.721
Beautifuls.

21:43.257 --> 21:45.522
- So why you cut 'em?
- I'm pruning.

21:45.624 --> 21:47.524
If you, uh, cut off the dead leaves,

21:47.626 --> 21:49.326
it allows the plant to grow back stronger

21:49.428 --> 21:50.639
and more potent.

21:50.963 --> 21:52.163
Matter of fact, hand me that, uh, weed,

21:52.265 --> 21:53.588
speaking of potent.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.600
Um, right after we get finished

21:56.702 --> 21:58.135
- talking about this whole...
- Yeah, this food truck.

21:58.237 --> 21:59.670
Yeah, what-what-what...
I don't know shit

21:59.772 --> 22:01.570
- about that, man, like...
- But I do.

22:01.673 --> 22:03.273
- You got a business plan?
- Man, I don't need

22:03.374 --> 22:05.108
no business plan. You my fuckin' cousin.

22:05.448 --> 22:07.065
You asking me for money, right?

22:07.248 --> 22:09.089
Then your ass needs a business plan.

22:11.372 --> 22:14.340
All right, well, I can...
I can give you at least half

22:14.442 --> 22:16.475
as soon as we sell the house, for sure.

22:16.577 --> 22:18.109
Man, that shit don't help me now.

22:18.211 --> 22:19.744
Plus, the profit on that shit's, what,

22:19.769 --> 22:22.070
like, 15 percent, if you're lucky.

22:22.249 --> 22:23.815
Well, what's the profit on what you doing?

22:23.917 --> 22:25.593
It depends, you know?

22:32.725 --> 22:34.759
- Yeah.
- Who the fuck is that?

22:34.861 --> 22:37.294
- That's Mr. Wu.
- Who is Mr. Wu?

22:37.319 --> 22:38.435
My tenant.

22:38.460 --> 22:39.599
He live in your closet?

22:39.624 --> 22:40.847
Why are you whispering?

22:40.847 --> 22:42.379
Yes, he lives in the closet.

22:42.481 --> 22:44.015
I mean, you know, in
Asia, the living quarters

22:44.117 --> 22:46.350
are, you know, much
smaller, so it's really like

22:46.452 --> 22:48.215
a fuckin' penthouse in there to him.

22:50.819 --> 22:52.222
He got a flat screen in here.

22:52.324 --> 22:53.890
Yeah, we hooked that shit up
for the Chinese New Year's.

22:53.992 --> 22:55.325
That's crazy.

22:55.427 --> 22:57.594
No, man. It's called being an entrepreneur.

22:57.837 --> 22:59.803
You see, the more streams
of revenue you have coming in

22:59.906 --> 23:02.606
outside of your major hustle,
the more risk you can take.

23:02.708 --> 23:04.842
I'm just trying to get
this one hustle going.

23:04.944 --> 23:06.158
Come on.

23:09.882 --> 23:11.214
All right, man. How much is this

23:11.316 --> 23:13.116
fuckin' food truck gonna cost?

23:13.218 --> 23:14.751
Like, 50,000, 100,000. But it...

23:14.853 --> 23:15.986
- What?
- It's not that bad.

23:16.088 --> 23:17.120
- We could...
- Jesus!

23:17.222 --> 23:18.621
I'ma make that back.

23:18.723 --> 23:19.990
Look, I'm in the middle of diversifying

23:20.092 --> 23:21.157
my portfolio right now,

23:21.260 --> 23:23.081
so I'm little cash poor, you dig?

23:24.196 --> 23:25.884
- Damn.
- Yeah, I get it.

23:27.355 --> 23:28.754
I don't know, man. I just...

23:28.856 --> 23:30.446
I just need something that's mine.

23:31.159 --> 23:33.447
You know, something for
me. I'd kill that shit.

23:33.894 --> 23:36.251
You know these food trucks
fail most of the time, right?

23:37.331 --> 23:38.597
Mine won't.

23:38.914 --> 23:40.555
My food good as hell.

23:40.555 --> 23:42.421
Plus, it can't. 'Cause if it does,

23:42.523 --> 23:45.006
then I have nothing,
and I can't have nothing.

23:47.694 --> 23:49.294
I already got that shit down pat.

23:52.932 --> 23:54.965
I don't know, man. I'm just
trying to be more like you, man.

23:55.068 --> 23:57.445
Just trying to give myself
some opportunities, you know?

24:02.508 --> 24:03.831
I feel you.

24:04.543 --> 24:06.911
- Shit gon' work.
- Okay.

24:07.355 --> 24:09.112
Let me see what I can
do. I'ma call my partner,

24:09.215 --> 24:11.915
see if we can hook up something
cheap for us, all right?

24:12.017 --> 24:14.471
- You serious?
- Man, when am I not serious?

24:15.787 --> 24:16.886
Is that a real qu...

24:16.988 --> 24:18.588
- Is that a serious question?
- Man, you talkin' shit.

24:18.690 --> 24:19.822
I don't know if you being serious now.

24:19.924 --> 24:20.923
You smoke a lot of weed.

24:21.025 --> 24:22.592
Oh, yeah, give me my shit, man.

24:22.694 --> 24:24.093
You know I smoked
outside in the parking lot

24:24.195 --> 24:26.362
before the SATs and I got a 1490?

24:26.464 --> 24:27.430
Hmm? What'd you get?

24:27.532 --> 24:28.831
Huh? What? What was it?

24:28.933 --> 24:30.433
I didn't think so!

24:30.535 --> 24:32.660
Mm-hmm. Smart, and I got
a big, old photogenic dick.

24:33.003 --> 24:34.969
Well, Jerrika doesn't seem to think so.

24:35.071 --> 24:36.804
- Yep.
- Oh, so you back

24:36.906 --> 24:38.940
- fuckin' her now, huh?
- Well, I'm trying.

24:39.042 --> 24:40.308
Uh-huh, yeah. You always been

24:40.333 --> 24:41.866
a domesticating bitch.

24:48.752 --> 24:51.085
Oh, man. Oh, he a wild boy.

24:51.110 --> 24:52.978
Oh, he a wild boy.

24:53.289 --> 24:54.821
What the fuck y'all sayin'?

24:54.923 --> 24:55.956
- Huh?
- What are y'all sayin'?

24:56.058 --> 24:57.057
What are y'all talking 'bout?

24:57.159 --> 24:58.125
Oh, he-he called you short.

24:58.227 --> 24:59.360
- He just...
- Yeah.

24:59.462 --> 25:00.594
- What?
- Yeah, we're just talkin' mess.

25:00.696 --> 25:01.928
I'll fuck Mr. Wu up.

25:02.030 --> 25:03.330
It's just fuckin' me up

25:03.432 --> 25:04.531
that he lives in your closet, though.

25:04.634 --> 25:05.764
Man, he comfortable too.

25:16.144 --> 25:17.234
Mm-hmm.

25:28.108 --> 25:29.947
You expecting company, Reg?

25:32.025 --> 25:33.616
- No.
- Mm.

25:34.395 --> 25:36.595
Tell me, Reg, what do
you know about me, huh?

25:38.699 --> 25:40.231
You and Trice go back.

25:40.334 --> 25:43.033
Hmm. And then I left

25:43.135 --> 25:44.791
and I put him on.

25:45.309 --> 25:46.660
Did he tell you that?

25:48.259 --> 25:49.626
- He ain't say shit.
- But he did

25:49.727 --> 25:51.393
send you to do me, right?

25:53.798 --> 25:56.944
Reg, as far as Trice is concerned,

25:57.601 --> 26:00.199
you're already damaged goods.

26:01.304 --> 26:02.970
You sure like to talk, old man.

26:02.995 --> 26:05.013
He's already looking for your replacement.

26:05.313 --> 26:07.980
And he's probably gonna
find one of your guys

26:08.411 --> 26:10.453
to put one in your back.

26:12.242 --> 26:14.958
Negro, you are disposable.

26:16.205 --> 26:17.303
Is there a point to all of this?

26:17.405 --> 26:18.383
Yes.

26:19.407 --> 26:20.637
That cop.

26:21.610 --> 26:23.223
You know, the one I saw Trice with.

26:23.912 --> 26:26.473
- No.
- "No," you don't know?

26:27.415 --> 26:29.282
Or, "No," you don't want to say.

26:29.384 --> 26:31.484
No, fuck you. Fuck is you talkin' 'bout?

26:33.821 --> 26:36.288
Listen, brother, I realize
that you are in a box,

26:36.390 --> 26:39.124
but you are going to have to decide,

26:39.226 --> 26:41.827
you know, one way or another
which way you gonna roll.

26:44.558 --> 26:45.810
All righty.

26:46.500 --> 26:47.633
Hey, Tep.

26:56.991 --> 26:58.812
Oh, shit.

27:00.146 --> 27:02.241
Yeah, he scares me too.

27:03.516 --> 27:05.757
Oh. You hungry, Reg?

27:06.519 --> 27:07.551
I-I'm a little bit hungry.

27:07.653 --> 27:08.987
I'm a Li... JB?

27:08.987 --> 27:10.826
Yeah, you mind if we stir up some food?

27:11.683 --> 27:13.449
- Hey, Tep, what we got?
- Pasta.

27:13.551 --> 27:15.640
- That's about it.
- Hell, that works for me.

27:15.807 --> 27:17.204
I love Italian.

27:30.734 --> 27:32.567
Emmett!

27:34.437 --> 27:35.506
Oh.

27:36.896 --> 27:38.677
Here you go.

27:42.712 --> 27:44.437
I gotta get EJ in T-ball.

27:45.547 --> 27:47.414
Ain't he a little young for that?

27:47.516 --> 27:48.923
I mean for when he get older.

27:49.384 --> 27:50.975
My dad didn't put me in shit.

27:52.154 --> 27:54.021
You know, he was around,
but he wasn't there.

27:54.123 --> 27:55.221
You know what I mean?

27:56.759 --> 27:58.360
I know you love EJ.

27:58.360 --> 28:00.495
But real talk, you don't
even know where he at.

28:01.123 --> 28:02.694
Yes, I do. He's with his mama.

28:02.987 --> 28:04.263
And where she at?

28:04.981 --> 28:06.613
She probably with her mama.

28:07.069 --> 28:08.597
You don't even know, do you?

28:11.940 --> 28:14.808
Hold on. Wait.

28:14.910 --> 28:16.100
You right. You right.

28:16.436 --> 28:18.669
You right. I tried to give her
a moment, but that's my baby.

28:18.771 --> 28:20.639
She can't just come and take my baby.

28:24.163 --> 28:25.595
Shit, her phone disconnected.

28:25.698 --> 28:27.163
She probably didn't pay her fuckin' bill.

28:27.316 --> 28:28.656
So what you gonna do now?

28:30.306 --> 28:32.739
Uh, come with me. Come with me, yeah.

28:32.841 --> 28:34.273
- We gotta go find...
- No, I ain't going

28:34.375 --> 28:35.475
to that girl house.

28:35.577 --> 28:37.010
I just got my hair done. She not about to

28:37.112 --> 28:38.377
- pull my tracks out.
- It's not even

28:38.480 --> 28:39.846
gonna go that way, come on.

28:39.948 --> 28:41.514
Kiesha, why you being like that?

28:41.617 --> 28:43.432
How 'bout you take me
on a real date next time?

28:43.885 --> 28:45.184
Maybe then I'll consider it.

28:45.286 --> 28:46.826
This is a real date.

28:47.288 --> 28:49.588
I thought this shit through. Hold on.

28:49.946 --> 28:51.058
Hey!

28:51.547 --> 28:52.697
Hold up!

28:53.349 --> 28:55.817
All right, we got the Jays potato chips

28:55.986 --> 28:57.652
and the Dean's ice cream.

28:57.754 --> 28:59.420
All we need is the peanut butter.

28:59.522 --> 29:01.656
- Regular or crunchy?
- My mom likes crunchy.

29:01.758 --> 29:04.158
- Say no more.
- Speaking of your moms,

29:04.260 --> 29:06.360
do you call your other mom Moms too?

29:06.462 --> 29:07.928
Nah, I call her Karen.

29:08.030 --> 29:09.129
Yeah, how is that?

29:09.231 --> 29:10.411
How's what?

29:10.699 --> 29:12.032
Livin' with two moms.

29:12.134 --> 29:13.389
It's cool.

29:13.602 --> 29:16.136
It's not, like, weird or anything?

29:16.238 --> 29:19.940
Nah. Karen's always been
there ever since I was little.

29:20.042 --> 29:22.208
- She like family.
- Have you ever seen them naked?

29:22.310 --> 29:24.610
- Like, together?
- Whoa, what?

29:24.712 --> 29:27.179
No. What? You ever seen your mom naked?

29:27.281 --> 29:29.248
Once. Wasn't what I expected.

29:29.350 --> 29:32.018
Man, let's just get out of here
so we can go play some <i> 2K.</i>

29:32.120 --> 29:33.585
Hey, Michael Jordan is my dude.

29:33.688 --> 29:35.554
- You always use Michael.
- You don't know how to use him.

29:35.657 --> 29:37.089
- Yes, I do.
- He gonna be no good

29:37.191 --> 29:38.357
when I dunk on you.

29:38.459 --> 29:40.172
All right, so, uh, we need...

29:41.795 --> 29:42.861
Shit.

29:42.963 --> 29:44.214
What?

29:48.168 --> 29:50.201
Oh, man, did your mom say what kind?

29:50.303 --> 29:52.037
No, it just says "tampons."

29:52.139 --> 29:53.872
Well, being that you have
three women in the house,

29:53.974 --> 29:55.916
there could be a lot of different types.

29:56.209 --> 29:57.708
What the fuck are you talking about?

29:57.810 --> 29:59.309
For example, my mom likes pads,

29:59.411 --> 30:01.912
but my aunt is more of a classic lady.

30:02.014 --> 30:03.580
How the fuck do you know this?

30:03.683 --> 30:05.849
Because I pay attention
when we go shopping.

30:05.951 --> 30:08.052
- Why?
- Knowledge.

30:08.312 --> 30:09.610
What type of knowledge?

30:09.713 --> 30:12.047
My mom say women sync
up when they together.

30:12.149 --> 30:13.715
What the fuck are you talking about?

30:13.817 --> 30:15.816
They get on the same menstrual cycle.

30:15.841 --> 30:17.979
It's nature's way of
achieving balance or something.

30:20.857 --> 30:22.589
Yeah, last night was funny.

30:22.691 --> 30:25.392
Let's just get out of here, all right?

30:25.417 --> 30:26.812
- Seriously.
- All right.

30:27.230 --> 30:28.628
What are you doing with my phone?

30:28.731 --> 30:30.564
Checking in with your moms because if you

30:30.666 --> 30:32.698
get this shit wrong, your
ass would be right back here.

30:32.800 --> 30:34.400
And it would be without my ass

30:34.502 --> 30:36.605
because I already did
my 10,000 steps today.

30:36.872 --> 30:37.871
- What?
- Now what the hell

30:37.973 --> 30:39.405
- is you talking about?
- Just chill, bro.

30:39.507 --> 30:40.606
Y'all wanna get out of here?

30:40.708 --> 30:42.018
- Yes.
- Fine.

30:44.512 --> 30:47.313
Hey, Ms. Williams, it's
Papa... I mean, Stanley...

30:47.415 --> 30:48.692
Giving you a call.

30:48.883 --> 30:50.648
We're standing in the
feminine hygiene aisle,

30:50.751 --> 30:54.460
and I was wondering if these are
for you, Kiesha, or the missus.

30:57.258 --> 30:58.757
Okay, I can see how
that's none of my business,

30:58.859 --> 31:01.593
but if you could just
be a bit more specific,

31:01.695 --> 31:03.003
it would be helpful.

31:03.330 --> 31:06.056
- Playing too much.
- The applicator. Okay.

31:06.565 --> 31:08.301
Super plus and slender?

31:09.235 --> 31:10.396
Okay.

31:11.504 --> 31:13.004
Scented or unscented?

31:13.106 --> 31:14.571
Yeah, I got those.

31:14.673 --> 31:16.874
I hear cardboard can
be rough, so do you want

31:16.976 --> 31:18.290
the plastic applicator?

31:19.379 --> 31:20.854
Yeah, I can just shut up.

31:21.447 --> 31:23.193
Are there any other products you want?

31:23.888 --> 31:25.404
You're welcome. Bye.

31:25.784 --> 31:27.217
- We good?
- So?

31:27.319 --> 31:28.618
We're all good, man. Let's get out of here.

31:28.720 --> 31:30.253
Thank God.

31:30.355 --> 31:31.788
That lady was looking at us weird.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.390
You think she knew we was tampon shoppin'?

31:33.491 --> 31:34.689
Whatever.

31:38.063 --> 31:39.847
Yeah.

31:40.497 --> 31:42.364
Man, did I tell y'all, when I was little,

31:42.466 --> 31:44.233
I wanted to be a astronaut?

31:44.258 --> 31:45.527
Can you believe that shit?

31:45.903 --> 31:47.569
What you wanted to be, Ronnie?

31:47.671 --> 31:48.770
I don't remember.

31:48.872 --> 31:49.905
Let me guess.

31:50.007 --> 31:51.693
Kung fu master.

31:52.076 --> 31:54.049
No. I'm just playin'.

31:54.678 --> 31:56.686
Probably wanted to be
something boring as shit.

31:57.376 --> 31:59.075
Like a mailman, right?

31:59.161 --> 32:01.395
Biggest worry is getting chased

32:01.420 --> 32:03.221
by a fuckin' Chihuahua.

32:03.299 --> 32:04.599
I don't wanna talk about it.

32:04.701 --> 32:06.467
Come on, Ronnie. Damn.

32:06.569 --> 32:07.917
We bonding here.

32:09.038 --> 32:10.666
Tell 'em what you wanted to be.

32:10.666 --> 32:11.801
A cobbler.

32:11.890 --> 32:14.212
This motherfucker wanted to
make women's shoes and shit.

32:14.528 --> 32:16.094
- That's right?
- That's right.

32:16.119 --> 32:17.323
Hell yeah.

32:18.412 --> 32:20.545
I bet Chauncy here wanted to be a doctor.

32:20.646 --> 32:22.979
And bam! Smart motherfucker got up,

32:23.082 --> 32:25.149
took his ass to school,
and became a doctor.

32:25.251 --> 32:26.616
Radiologist.

32:26.718 --> 32:28.168
That's still a doctor.

32:29.048 --> 32:30.354
Eight years of med school.

32:30.456 --> 32:31.745
One-year internship.

32:32.290 --> 32:33.830
Four years' residency.

32:34.259 --> 32:35.677
Shit, that's it?

32:35.974 --> 32:38.341
I could be a gynecologist,
then. Ain't that right, Jean?

32:38.443 --> 32:39.775
- Yeah.
- Come on, Ronnie.

32:39.878 --> 32:41.144
What's up, man?

32:41.246 --> 32:42.545
What you wanted to be?

33:11.984 --> 33:13.975
You got some nerve

33:14.077 --> 33:15.276
comin' all up in here.

33:15.378 --> 33:17.278
Ms. Bryant, wh-where's Tiffany at?

33:17.728 --> 33:19.914
- She ain't here.
- Ms. Bryant, please.

33:20.367 --> 33:21.733
Listen, I'm trying to
be a good father here.

33:21.835 --> 33:23.311
I'm trying to do the right thing.

33:24.970 --> 33:27.438
Don't you got two other
kids by two different women?

33:27.540 --> 33:28.805
- Where they at?
- What's that got to...

33:31.110 --> 33:33.025
They out of state with they mamas.

33:33.412 --> 33:35.062
We FaceTime sometimes.

33:35.548 --> 33:38.249
So you mostly a digital daddy, then.

33:38.351 --> 33:39.912
Listen, I just miss my boy.

33:40.752 --> 33:42.569
I miss him. I wanna see him.

33:43.221 --> 33:44.448
I wanna hold him.

33:44.448 --> 33:46.122
Look, I can't tell you where Tiffany is

33:46.224 --> 33:47.557
'cause she don't want nobody to know.

33:47.659 --> 33:49.125
Well, how come she don't want me to know?

33:49.227 --> 33:51.628
That said, I never promised

33:51.730 --> 33:53.763
not to tell nobody where EJ at.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.633
All right, cuz. I want
you to be open-minded.

33:57.735 --> 33:58.967
All right? That's all I'm asking.

33:59.069 --> 34:00.502
When am I not open-minded?

34:00.604 --> 34:03.138
Them two Spanish girls

34:03.240 --> 34:04.947
from the Crane Club back in the day?

34:06.477 --> 34:08.042
You talkin' 'bout the...

34:08.145 --> 34:09.568
They was drag queens.

34:10.013 --> 34:11.880
See? Judging.

34:11.982 --> 34:13.547
And limiting yourself.

34:14.684 --> 34:16.815
Here she is!

34:21.891 --> 34:23.857
All right, now, before
you shit all over it,

34:23.958 --> 34:25.466
- it's...
- I love it.

34:26.329 --> 34:28.371
- Huh?
- I love it.

34:28.864 --> 34:30.929
- For real?
- Hell yeah.

34:31.032 --> 34:32.799
I mean, it ain't exactly
what I had in mind,

34:32.824 --> 34:34.737
but this can definitely work.

34:35.821 --> 34:37.670
Even the-the whole "Lick Me" thing?

34:37.773 --> 34:39.161
- This?
- Yeah.

34:39.440 --> 34:40.674
Oh, no. This is terrible.

34:40.775 --> 34:42.409
But, I mean, with a lot of paint

34:42.511 --> 34:44.911
and, like, a lot of work,
I could make this dope.

34:45.283 --> 34:46.549
- It's gonna be dope.
- That's what I'm...

34:46.574 --> 34:47.860
I like to hear that. Good.

34:48.373 --> 34:50.206
How 'bout you take it for a spin, then?

34:50.408 --> 34:51.638
This the keys?

34:51.942 --> 34:53.271
I mean, yeah. It's...

34:56.246 --> 34:57.680
- Ah.
- Oh, man,

34:57.705 --> 34:59.204
I love you so much, man.

34:59.229 --> 35:00.942
Hey. I love you too, man.

35:01.386 --> 35:03.318
- I owe you big.
- Yeah, you do.

35:03.421 --> 35:04.753
My share. All right?

35:04.855 --> 35:06.688
- All right.
- Hit me up.

35:06.790 --> 35:08.087
Hey, where you goin'?

35:08.859 --> 35:10.421
You ain't gonna take a ride with me?

35:11.115 --> 35:13.128
Oh, no, I'm... No, I'm good.

35:13.530 --> 35:14.629
Really?

35:14.731 --> 35:16.211
Man, I can't be seen in this shit.

35:16.211 --> 35:17.832
Why you throwing shade, dog?

35:17.934 --> 35:19.000
I'm not, man. I got nothin'

35:19.102 --> 35:20.284
but love for you, kid.

35:20.285 --> 35:21.602
But I'ma-I'ma be a silent partner.

35:21.704 --> 35:23.036
This is all you. All right?

35:23.138 --> 35:24.505
Hit me when the money start coming in.

35:24.607 --> 35:25.672
- Okay?
- All right?

35:25.697 --> 35:26.618
All right?

35:30.245 --> 35:31.387
What?

35:31.672 --> 35:33.853
This is crazy.

35:34.904 --> 35:36.182
Yes!

35:36.285 --> 35:37.350
How you doin'?

35:37.453 --> 35:39.013
What can I help you guys with?

35:41.956 --> 35:44.390
How that pill count comin'?
We gotta move this tonight.

35:44.492 --> 35:46.325
Got enough to keep the
whole South Side lit.

35:46.428 --> 35:47.795
Oh, that's dope.

35:49.030 --> 35:51.071
Hey, y'all need to wake up.

35:51.764 --> 35:53.381
Rise and shine.

35:54.880 --> 35:56.435
Come on, Doc. Get up.

35:57.760 --> 35:58.703
Chauncy!

35:58.806 --> 36:00.705
Shit!

36:00.808 --> 36:01.963
Jean!

36:05.579 --> 36:07.312
This motherfucker done crossed over.

36:07.414 --> 36:09.815
No, we was just talkin'.

36:09.917 --> 36:12.059
I can't have no dead people in here.

36:12.518 --> 36:14.885
- He gonna go zombie on us.
- Hey, man, relax!

36:14.987 --> 36:16.491
He ain't even turn yet.

36:18.307 --> 36:20.602
- Where you goin'?
- I ain't takin' no chances.

36:22.440 --> 36:23.840
You gonna get him out of here.

36:23.865 --> 36:25.932
- What?
- Yeah.

36:25.977 --> 36:28.167
I'm cashing in that motherfuckin' chip.

36:28.349 --> 36:31.073
Plus, he patched up your dying ass.

36:35.848 --> 36:37.439
No, man.

36:38.994 --> 36:40.300
Shit!

36:49.337 --> 36:51.904
Man, slow the fuck down. Shit.

37:01.139 --> 37:02.627
Bring your ass on, man.

37:02.834 --> 37:04.815
Y'all bringing my property value down.

37:17.597 --> 37:19.064
And where am I supposed to put him?

37:19.166 --> 37:20.661
You put him anywhere you want to.

37:20.661 --> 37:21.993
Just away from here.

37:23.718 --> 37:25.735
And hurry your ass up before he turn.

37:26.347 --> 37:27.422
Come on, man.

37:29.537 --> 37:31.099
Shit.

38:08.173 --> 38:09.573
I don't care what y'all talkin' 'bout.

38:09.675 --> 38:11.341
- Shorty was bad.
- But you know

38:11.442 --> 38:12.875
- you weren't getting her.
- Why y'all hatin'?

38:12.977 --> 38:14.109
I mean, if I was talking to her,

38:14.211 --> 38:15.544
it would have been a different story.

38:15.646 --> 38:17.112
- Man, shut up.
- Man, stop hating.

38:17.214 --> 38:18.732
Man, you just mad 'cause
your shorty can't pull her.

38:20.925 --> 38:21.971
Y'all ain't coming in?

38:21.996 --> 38:24.242
Nah, your mom seemed
stressed out on the phone,

38:24.267 --> 38:25.867
so I'm gon' bounce.

38:25.969 --> 38:28.467
Yeah, me too. I got shit to do.

38:29.404 --> 38:30.633
What type of shit?

38:32.153 --> 38:33.406
What's up with all the questions?

38:33.508 --> 38:35.108
We just don't want
anything to happen to you.

38:35.210 --> 38:36.643
Ain't nothin' gon' happen.

38:36.668 --> 38:38.101
- Reg looks out for me.
- That don't mean

38:38.131 --> 38:39.697
- he could always protect you.
- I'm good.

38:39.729 --> 38:41.262
- You're not good.
- Me?

38:41.583 --> 38:43.551
You the motherfucker that shot somebody.

38:47.521 --> 38:48.754
I'm out of here.

38:51.535 --> 38:52.902
Man, what the fuck he talkin' 'bout?

38:52.927 --> 38:53.935
Nothin'.

38:55.196 --> 38:57.564
Friends don't keep
secrets from one another.

38:57.999 --> 38:59.645
Not real ones.

39:01.402 --> 39:02.715
Papa.

39:34.966 --> 39:36.085
Tiffany.

39:39.824 --> 39:40.736
Tiff?

39:41.873 --> 39:43.272
I've been trying to call you.

39:46.744 --> 39:48.510
Tiffany, who-who house is this?

39:48.612 --> 39:50.847
Let me guess, your mama must've
told you to come find him.

39:50.949 --> 39:52.648
No, I wanted to see him.

39:52.750 --> 39:54.703
Why you got my son in some random house?

39:54.885 --> 39:56.184
Huh? And why the door open?

39:56.286 --> 39:57.652
A month ago, I couldn't even get you

39:57.754 --> 39:59.721
- to acknowledge he was yours.
- What?

40:00.121 --> 40:01.987
So you think you can just
jump in and out of his life

40:02.089 --> 40:03.389
whenever you fuckin' feel like it?

40:04.972 --> 40:06.404
Did it ever occur to
you that I might've been

40:06.429 --> 40:07.795
going through something myself?

40:07.820 --> 40:09.748
I don't know. You wasn't
answering the phone.

40:09.964 --> 40:11.396
What kinda mom just
come in and just show up

40:11.498 --> 40:12.764
- whenever she feel?
- Look, don't act like

40:12.789 --> 40:14.122
you some father of the year

40:14.147 --> 40:15.179
'cause you had him for two weeks.

40:15.204 --> 40:16.415
I had him for two years

40:16.729 --> 40:18.396
with no help from you, Emmett.

40:18.466 --> 40:19.837
I been helping, all right?

40:19.939 --> 40:21.411
I been-I been payin'
for-for day care,

40:21.411 --> 40:22.513
Pull-Ups and shit.

40:22.513 --> 40:24.536
Good. I hope you plan on keeping that up.

40:25.496 --> 40:27.096
Fuck you, Tiffany. I'm-I'm
grabbing the diaper bag

40:27.199 --> 40:28.630
- and I'm goin'.
- You can't just take him

40:28.732 --> 40:29.998
'cause you feel like it, Emmett.

40:30.101 --> 40:31.534
Move, move.

40:31.635 --> 40:33.369
All right, this is my
son too. I got rights.

40:33.394 --> 40:35.039
- No, you don't.
- How not?

40:35.540 --> 40:37.239
If you start paying some child support,

40:37.341 --> 40:39.308
then we'll talk about visitation rights.

40:39.410 --> 40:40.876
- Child support?
- Child support.

40:40.978 --> 40:42.545
You gonna hold some money over my kid head?

40:42.646 --> 40:44.012
I... that ain't right.

40:44.115 --> 40:46.381
I make minimum wage and I'm in school.

40:46.483 --> 40:47.982
Food, rent, diapers, day care.

40:48.085 --> 40:49.650
It's all on me, Emmett.

40:49.752 --> 40:51.419
You spend your money on Jordans and Yeezys.

40:51.521 --> 40:52.920
Tiffany, I'm not about to fight with you.

40:53.022 --> 40:54.589
All I wanna see is my boy.

40:54.691 --> 40:56.616
What you can do is put
some money in our pocket.

40:57.064 --> 40:58.330
- Our pocket?
- That's what you can do.

40:58.432 --> 40:59.564
No, your pocket. You want me to put

40:59.667 --> 41:00.732
some money in your pocket.

41:00.835 --> 41:02.134
- You don't get it.
- Tiffany, I'm not about to...

41:02.159 --> 41:03.457
- Stay away from my baby.
- Stop trying

41:03.482 --> 41:04.616
- to get strong with me.
- Or I'ma call the police.

41:04.616 --> 41:05.748
- Police?
- Yes.

41:05.850 --> 41:06.949
You gonna call the police on me?

41:07.052 --> 41:08.518
Everything all right, baby?

41:13.791 --> 41:14.977
Huh?

41:20.364 --> 41:21.755
Just go, Emmett.

41:26.270 --> 41:27.469
Okay.

41:34.111 --> 41:35.710
Shh. Okay.

41:35.812 --> 41:37.238
You're okay.

41:59.234 --> 42:02.735
Mmm, now, this not bad, Tep, considerin'.

42:02.837 --> 42:04.204
Could've used some chili powder.

42:04.306 --> 42:05.280
Yeah.

42:08.711 --> 42:12.111
So, Reggie, I really need you
to tell me who killed that kid.

42:12.213 --> 42:14.246
You know, the star basketball player

42:14.348 --> 42:15.281
up near your stash house.

42:15.383 --> 42:16.599
I don't know.

42:16.850 --> 42:19.481
On my granny's soul, I have no idea.

42:19.787 --> 42:20.886
Mm.

42:28.795 --> 42:29.961
No, no, no! Please, hey!

42:29.986 --> 42:31.152
Sit down.

42:42.576 --> 42:45.137
- It's all good.
- Yes, yes. It is all good.

42:46.437 --> 42:48.678
We've met before, right?

42:48.780 --> 42:50.465
You remember, the block party.

42:50.782 --> 42:52.682
What's your name, little man?

42:54.953 --> 42:56.520
- Jake.
- Jake.

42:56.622 --> 42:58.388
Jake, and I'll bet that you would be

42:58.413 --> 42:59.978
Reggie's little brother, right?

43:00.422 --> 43:02.024
- Yeah.
- Yeah, well, it seems

43:02.072 --> 43:04.475
Reggie forgot to tell us about you.

43:07.064 --> 43:10.433
You know, I thought you was
just running with him that night,

43:10.458 --> 43:12.991
but now that I know you're blood...

43:20.110 --> 43:21.910
So, Jake, what school you go to?

43:22.834 --> 43:24.066
I go to Hopkins.

43:24.091 --> 43:26.091
Well, Jake from Hopkins...

43:26.116 --> 43:28.082
...I'm gonna need you
to do something for me.

43:31.384 --> 43:32.441
What?

43:36.473 --> 43:38.548
Toss that in the sink for me.

43:39.513 --> 43:40.677
Over there.

43:49.889 --> 43:51.965
Yo, Reg, sit down.

43:55.743 --> 43:59.612
You know, you should be
very proud of that young man.

43:59.714 --> 44:01.381
You know, he could go places.

44:01.694 --> 44:03.983
All you need to do is keep
him out of trouble and...

44:04.085 --> 44:05.307
and alive.

44:06.988 --> 44:09.194
So about that cop again.

44:09.756 --> 44:12.057
Are you suddenly remembering anything?

44:19.294 --> 44:21.934
- Some dude named Wallace.
- Wallace, Wallace.

44:22.035 --> 44:23.868
Does Trice got him in pocket?

44:23.970 --> 44:26.337
Mm-hmm. He get a taste of everything.

44:26.817 --> 44:28.684
In return, he make sure
we don't get jammed up.

44:28.786 --> 44:30.958
Mm, yeah. Yeah.

44:32.785 --> 44:34.322
How 'bout the kid, the basketball player?

44:34.424 --> 44:35.739
You remember anything about him?

44:36.594 --> 44:38.575
Ain't nobody said shit about that.

44:41.065 --> 44:42.537
I'm dead-ass serious.

44:50.940 --> 44:52.916
Just tell me what you want me to do.

44:57.470 --> 44:58.669
Come here.

45:03.207 --> 45:05.170
Okay. You keep that between us.

45:11.093 --> 45:12.335
Gentlemen.

45:16.098 --> 45:19.231
Ah. Hey, Jake.

45:21.636 --> 45:23.148
Stay healthy, little man.

45:34.481 --> 45:35.723
Shit.

46:24.729 --> 46:25.902
Chauncy?

46:27.931 --> 46:29.337
Chauncy, wake up.

46:29.866 --> 46:30.989
Wake up.

46:32.918 --> 46:34.105
Chauncy?

46:37.607 --> 46:38.848
Oh, my God.

46:39.710 --> 46:42.470
No. No!

46:44.257 --> 46:46.772
No!

46:47.180 --> 46:48.204
Mom?

46:49.203 --> 46:51.551
Chauncy.

46:53.723 --> 46:55.605
Don't look. No!

47:03.397 --> 47:04.891
Oh, God.

47:16.856 --> 47:18.778
J!

47:26.787 --> 47:27.932
What do you think?

47:28.983 --> 47:30.291
It's dope, right?

47:30.457 --> 47:32.157
What's with the tongue?

47:32.789 --> 47:33.991
Try not to look at the tongue.

47:34.093 --> 47:35.459
- Not the tongue.
- Oh, that's...

47:35.561 --> 47:36.761
Everything else probably,
but not the tongue.

47:36.863 --> 47:37.928
That's just a little bit hard.

47:38.030 --> 47:39.230
It's gonna be great, all right?

47:39.331 --> 47:40.798
'Cause I'ma put a stove
and a grill right here

47:40.900 --> 47:42.032
where the freezer is already, right?

47:42.135 --> 47:43.333
- Mm-hmm.
- And then up top,

47:43.435 --> 47:44.635
it's just gonna have a bunch of storage

47:44.737 --> 47:46.003
for, like, all my supplies.

47:46.105 --> 47:47.838
Easy access. I got a couple coolers in here

47:47.940 --> 47:49.606
'cause, I mean, it's an ice cream truck.

47:49.708 --> 47:52.090
You know, so I don't lose no perishables.

47:52.129 --> 47:53.395
I don't have to put my stuff on ice

47:53.497 --> 47:54.740
like I thought I would.

47:54.740 --> 47:55.807
But it gets better. Check it out.

47:57.510 --> 47:58.540
So...

47:59.779 --> 48:00.845
see the vision.

48:00.947 --> 48:02.479
- All black...
- Mm-hmm.

48:02.896 --> 48:05.149
...red trim, new rims and tires,

48:05.251 --> 48:06.550
tinted windows.

48:06.912 --> 48:08.177
- Right?
- Mm-hmm.

48:09.421 --> 48:11.688
And I think I'ma call it Bust a Taco.

48:11.973 --> 48:13.156
Bust a Taco?

48:13.258 --> 48:16.633
Yeah, just think Mexican meets soul food.

48:18.663 --> 48:20.363
- I like it.
- Ah, see?

48:22.901 --> 48:24.256
Just...

48:25.091 --> 48:27.636
...it's gonna take a lot of TLC.

48:27.961 --> 48:29.311
Yeah, it does need a little help.

48:29.311 --> 48:30.785
But I'm willing to do it.

48:33.204 --> 48:35.152
I'm actually really excited to do it.

48:37.852 --> 48:40.633
I'm just glad to see you happy and...

48:42.241 --> 48:44.207
doing what you wanna do.

48:50.383 --> 48:52.489
I ain't doin' it yet. Not without you.

48:55.497 --> 48:56.797
Okay, baby, look,

48:56.822 --> 49:00.031
I know I can't take back what I did.

49:02.362 --> 49:03.736
But it'll never happen again.

49:03.838 --> 49:04.837
I can promise you that.

49:05.207 --> 49:06.267
I know.

49:06.641 --> 49:08.774
And I'll do whatever it
takes for you to trust me.

49:11.279 --> 49:12.812
'Cause all this is great,

49:12.914 --> 49:14.513
but it's nothing if
you're not there with me.

49:35.768 --> 49:38.202
- I take you in my truck.
- No!

49:45.211 --> 49:46.750
Assalamu alaikum.

49:47.746 --> 49:48.743
Thank you.

49:48.881 --> 49:50.113
Let me welcome you.

50:05.130 --> 50:06.383
Come on in, brother.

50:09.233 --> 50:10.613
How you been?

50:11.440 --> 50:12.368
All right.

50:12.470 --> 50:14.470
If you don't mind taking those shoes off.

50:21.245 --> 50:22.548
So what's going on?

50:25.015 --> 50:26.984
You tell me.

50:32.688 --> 50:34.100
You kill somebody?

50:37.183 --> 50:38.725
Just between me and you.

50:41.196 --> 50:42.599
You got shot.

50:43.171 --> 50:45.037
Yeah, so?

50:50.016 --> 50:51.570
You ain't gotta front for me.

50:52.052 --> 50:53.444
I been you.

50:56.657 --> 50:57.889
Was this your first time?

50:57.991 --> 50:59.047
Shit.

50:59.858 --> 51:01.707
I ain't come here for this, man.

51:01.707 --> 51:03.364
Then why'd you come here?

51:06.717 --> 51:08.264
I don't know.

51:09.464 --> 51:10.759
Have a seat, brother.

51:13.937 --> 51:15.303
You welcome.

51:29.647 --> 51:31.587
When I was 19 years old,

51:33.531 --> 51:35.674
I was kicking it with some of my guys

51:35.977 --> 51:37.725
around 85th and Stony.

51:38.613 --> 51:39.805
This party.

51:41.353 --> 51:43.313
We got into it with these dudes.

51:45.479 --> 51:46.909
I wanted to get them up off us,

51:46.934 --> 51:49.447
so I pulled out a pistol.

51:51.696 --> 51:52.882
One shot.

51:55.501 --> 51:57.298
Went through the window of a house.

52:00.434 --> 52:01.952
Killed a little girl.

52:02.669 --> 52:04.081
Seven years old.

52:06.534 --> 52:08.040
I took her from her mother.

52:08.927 --> 52:10.695
I took her from her father.

52:15.389 --> 52:16.599
Her life.

52:18.203 --> 52:19.367
For what?

52:22.207 --> 52:23.605
When I first got locked up,

52:24.475 --> 52:26.709
I wasn't even thinkin' how bad it was,

52:26.734 --> 52:27.820
what I did.

52:29.200 --> 52:30.967
I didn't wanna carry that weight.

52:33.528 --> 52:35.691
You know, once I got inside, I couldn't...

52:36.487 --> 52:37.726
couldn't sleep.

52:38.523 --> 52:39.875
I couldn't think.

52:40.590 --> 52:42.201
It was hard for me to eat.

52:43.975 --> 52:46.075
I didn't know how to
express what I was feeling.

52:49.198 --> 52:52.022
The block don't teach you how
to express that pain, do it?

52:54.170 --> 52:56.103
One day on the yard,
this brother came up to me

52:56.128 --> 52:58.219
and asked me the same question I asked you.

52:59.274 --> 53:01.159
He saw I was carrying something.

53:02.878 --> 53:04.455
This brother name was Malik.

53:05.981 --> 53:08.257
He helped me come to terms with myself

53:09.585 --> 53:10.879
through Allah.

53:12.154 --> 53:14.415
And it's through Allah's grace and mercy

53:14.743 --> 53:16.397
that I'm on the right path.

53:24.799 --> 53:28.685
Brother, Allah is
all-knowing and all-seeing

53:29.329 --> 53:31.441
but most forgiving and most merciful.

53:32.465 --> 53:33.885
<i>Alhamdulillah.</i>
