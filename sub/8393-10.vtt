07:38.660 --> 07:39.797
WITH THIS, UH, WORK TRIP,

07:39.900 --> 07:41.834
BUT MINNESOTA IS A DONE DEAL.

07:41.940 --> 07:43.100
I ALREADY HAVE A GOOD JOB OFFER.

07:43.220 --> 07:44.528
MY FAMILY IS THERE.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.598
PUBLIC SCHOOLS ARE
ACTUALLY A VIABLE OPTION.

07:46.700 --> 07:49.260
WE NEED THIS, AND YOU BE'I'I'ER NOT
TRY AND SABOTAGE IT.

07:49.360 --> 07:51.351
- SO MY RELATIONSHIP WITH HER,

07:51.470 --> 07:53.222
THAT'S NOT A FACTOR
IN THIS, RIGHT? NOTHING?

07:53.330 --> 07:54.774
- YOU DON'T HAVE TO FREAK OUT
OVER THEM, YOU KNOW.

07:54.880 --> 07:56.700
[angry murmuring from afar]

07:56.820 --> 07:59.675
THEY'VE BEEN DOING IT
SINCE FOREVER, SO...

08:02.820 --> 08:04.469
- JULIA SAYS WE HAVE
TO ARGUE

08:04.580 --> 08:06.616
THAT THE LUNCHEONE'I'I'E
IS A GOOD NEIGHBOR,

08:06.720 --> 08:07.402
AND WE GOT
TO BEG FOR SOMETHING

08:07.520 --> 08:08.680
CALLED A "USE VARIANCE."

08:08.790 --> 08:10.826
- ARGUE WITH WHO?
AND ARGUE WHERE?

08:10.930 --> 08:13.342
- AT THE CITY COUNCIL MEETING.

08:13.450 --> 08:15.509
- WELL, WHAT HAPPENS
IF WE DON'T ARGUE?

08:15.630 --> 08:16.699
- WORSE CASE SCENARIO,

08:16.800 --> 08:18.552
LIKE, THE FAR END
OF THE SPECTRUM,

08:18.670 --> 08:21.662
SHE COULD SHUT US DOWN.

08:21.770 --> 08:24.079
- ALL RIGHT, WHEN--WHEN IS
THIS CITY COUNCIL MEETING?

08:24.190 --> 08:25.259
- TOMORROW NIGHT.

08:25.360 --> 08:26.258
- IT'S TOMORROW NIGHT?

08:26.360 --> 08:27.395
- IS THAT INCONVENIENT...

08:27.500 --> 08:28.910
- WHAT IS WRONG WITH YOU,
CROSBY?

08:29.020 --> 08:30.157
WHY WOULDN'T YOU GIVE ME
A HEAD'S UP ABOUT THIS?

08:30.260 --> 08:31.534
- I THOUGHT THIS WAS A BLUFF.

08:31.640 --> 08:33.153
- OKAY, WELL, WE NEED
TO TALK TO HER TODAY.

08:33.270 --> 08:34.988
- OKAY, YOU'RE WELCOME TO TRY
TO TALK TO THIS WOMAN.

08:35.100 --> 08:36.260
I'VE ALREADY TRIED.

08:36.370 --> 08:37.712
I WENT TO HER HOUSE
AND OFFERED HER A GIFT BASKET.

08:37.820 --> 08:39.435
- HERE'S WHAT WE'RE GONNA DO:

08:39.550 --> 08:41.336
WE'RE GONNA GO TALK TO HER,
WE'RE GONNA GO HAT IN HAND,

08:41.450 --> 08:42.519
WE'RE GONNA SMILE,
WE'RE GONNA BE NICE,

08:42.620 --> 08:44.372
WE'RE GONNA APOLOGIZE,
AND I'LL DO THE TALKING.

08:44.480 --> 08:46.107
- OKAY, THAT'S GONNA BE
GREAT.

08:46.210 --> 08:47.620
- AND I'M GONNA SAY WHATEVER
IT TAKES TO SAVE OUR STUDIO.

08:47.730 --> 08:49.482
- YOU THINK YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
SOME JEDI MIND APPROACH

08:49.590 --> 08:50.932
THAT'S GONNA SOMEHOW,
MAGICALLY. ..

08:51.040 --> 08:52.382
- CROSBY, CROSBY,
WE'RE GONNA BE NICE...

08:52.490 --> 08:53.457
- ALL RIGHT,
I'LL WITNESS THAT...

08:53.560 --> 08:55.073
- I THINK NOW WOULD BE
A GOOD TIME

08:55.180 --> 08:56.317
FOR YOU TO GET BACK
INTO THE STUDIO WITH GLEN.

08:56.430 --> 08:57.590
- OH, IS THAT WHAT I SHOULD DO?

08:57.700 --> 08:58.974
- YEAH, THAT'S
WHERE YOU SHOULD BE.

08:59.090 --> 09:00.876
- OKAY, I WAS LIKE,
WHAT AM I DOING IN HERE?

09:00.980 --> 09:02.083
SHOULDN'T I BE SOMEWHERE?
I COULDN'T REMEMBER WHERE.

09:02.190 --> 09:03.327
AND NOW I GET IT!

09:03.430 --> 09:05.534
THANK YOU FOR YOUR GUIDANCE.

09:05.640 --> 09:08.359
- HI, IT'S ME.

09:08.470 --> 09:10.199
I'M--I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING HERE.

09:10.300 --> 09:13.474
BUT I WAS WRONG,
AND I'M THINKING ABOUT YOU,

09:13.580 --> 09:15.514
AND I'M SORRY.

09:15.620 --> 09:18.999
AND I MISS YOU.

09:19.110 --> 09:20.589
CALL ME, OKAY?

09:24.520 --> 09:25.839
- SO MOM TOLD ME
ABOUT YOU GUYS

09:25.940 --> 09:28.386
MAYBE MOVING TO MINNESOTA.

09:28.490 --> 09:29.866
- YEAH.
[laughs]

09:29.980 --> 09:30.935
- ANYWAY, I WAS JUST
KIND OF WONDERING

09:31.050 --> 09:33.427
HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT THE WHOLE THING.

09:33.530 --> 09:35.259
- ABOUT WHAT?

09:35.360 --> 09:37.669
- ABOUT MAYBE MOVING AWAY.

09:37.780 --> 09:39.987
- WELL, I THINK IT SOUNDS
REALLY COOL.

09:40.090 --> 09:41.569
I MEAN, I'VE LIVED HERE
MY WHOLE LIFE

09:41.680 --> 09:43.466
AND I'VE NEVER BEEN ANYWHERE,

09:43.580 --> 09:45.024
EXCEPT UP TO SEE YOU.

09:45.130 --> 09:46.097
AND PLUS MOM SAYS

09:46.200 --> 09:47.360
THAT THE HOUSES
ARE WAY CHEAPER THERE.

09:47.480 --> 09:48.788
SO IF WE GO,

09:48.890 --> 09:50.539
WE CAN GET
A GINORMOUS HOUSE.

09:50.650 --> 09:52.754
[titters]

09:54.830 --> 09:57.697
ARE YOU OKAY?

09:57.800 --> 10:00.075
- YEAH, NO,
I'M FINE, I'M FINE.

10:00.180 --> 10:02.102
I JUST THOUGHT
YOU MIGHT BE ANXIOUS

10:02.220 --> 10:05.075
ABOUT MOVING AND--
AND LEAVING YOUR FRIENDS

10:05.190 --> 10:08.011
AND, YOU KNOW,
LEAVING YOUR SCHOOL.

10:08.120 --> 10:09.018
- YEAH.

10:09.120 --> 10:10.917
- AND...BEING FARTHER AWAY
FROM ME.

10:11.020 --> 10:14.183
- THAT PART'S HORRIBLE.

10:17.030 --> 10:18.361
IT IS.

10:18.470 --> 10:20.199
- YEAH, I KNOW, I KNOW.

10:20.300 --> 10:21.574
YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:21.690 --> 10:24.261
IT SEEMS PRETTY COOL,
THOUGH, RIGHT?

10:24.380 --> 10:26.371
- IT DOES. [laughs]
- YEAH.

10:26.480 --> 10:29.415
- IT DOES.

10:29.520 --> 10:31.556
- YOU ATE
ALL THE BAMBOO THINGIES.

10:31.660 --> 10:32.934
- I DIDN'T DO IT ON PURPOSE.

10:33.040 --> 10:33.517
- MMM, TOFU.

10:33.630 --> 10:36.281
YOU LOVE TOFU.

10:36.390 --> 10:37.357
- I DON'T KNOW IF I LOVE IT.

10:37.460 --> 10:38.358
- BYE.

10:38.460 --> 10:39.666
[laughs]

10:39.770 --> 10:41.283
- WAIT, WAIT, SO...

10:41.390 --> 10:43.802
WHAT EXACTLY DID YOUR UNCLE SAY
I WAS GONNA BE DOING?

10:43.910 --> 10:45.150
- WELL...
- SPECIFICALLY.

10:45.260 --> 10:47.319
- SPECIFICALLY, I MEAN,
I DON'T KNOW.

10:47.430 --> 10:49.432
BUILDING THINGS, I THINK,
IS THE GENERAL TONE OF IT.

10:49.540 --> 10:50.609
- NO, AND, LIKE,
I'VE BUILT THINGS.

10:50.710 --> 10:52.223
BUT I'VE NEVER BUILT
ANYTHING LEGAL,

10:52.340 --> 10:53.227
LIKE, UP TO CODE.

10:53.340 --> 10:54.819
- SURE, CODE.

10:54.930 --> 10:55.817
- HE'S PROBABLY USING,
LIKE, UNION GUYS AND STUFF

10:57.480 --> 10:59.061
- WHAT ARE YOU SO NERVOUS FOR?
- I'M NOT NERVOUS,

10:59.170 --> 11:00.614
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO BE RESPONSIBLE

11:00.720 --> 11:02.039
FOR A BUILDING COLLAPSING
OR SOMETHING,

11:02.140 --> 11:03.346
'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M DOING.

11:03.450 --> 11:04.997
- NO, YOU'RE GONNA BE GREAT.

11:05.110 --> 11:07.692
THEY'RE ALL GONNA LOVE YOU.

11:07.800 --> 11:11.668
ALMOST AS MUCH AS I DO.

11:18.780 --> 11:19.917
- HERE YOU GO.

11:20.020 --> 11:21.248
- THANK YOU.
- SURE.

11:21.370 --> 11:23.088
- DID YOU ORDER THAT?
- TAKE ONE--YEAH.

11:23.190 --> 11:25.397
TAKE--
- THAT WOULD BE THREE.

11:25.510 --> 11:26.602
- YEAH.

11:26.720 --> 11:27.914
YOU GOT TO DO THINGS IN THREES.

11:28.030 --> 11:31.545
- FINE.

11:31.650 --> 11:35.234
I DON'T WANT TO SOUND LIKE A...

11:35.340 --> 11:36.546
DOWN ER. ..

11:36.660 --> 11:38.446
- [snickers]
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

11:38.550 --> 11:40.586
- BUT MY DAUGHTER...

11:40.700 --> 11:43.032
IS GONNA BE LIVING
IN MINNESOTA NOW.

11:43.150 --> 11:45.038
- DON'T THINK ABOUT THIS NOW.

11:45.150 --> 11:46.594
THIS IS GONNA MAKE YOU TOO...
- FOUR-HOUR PLANE RIDE.

11:46.700 --> 11:47.519
SAD NOW.
- THAT'S A FOUR-HOUR PLANE RIDE.

11:47.630 --> 11:49.427
- I UNDERSTAND IT'S FOUR HOURS.

11:49.530 --> 11:50.565
- I'M NOT GONNA SEE HER AS MUCH.
SHE'S GONNA BE OVER THERE.

11:50.670 --> 11:52.729
SHE'S GONNA BE
WITH SANDY'S FAMILY

11:52.850 --> 11:55.011
IN SAN DY'S HOMETOWN.

11:55.120 --> 11:56.985
AND I'M GONNA BE, LIKE, ERASED
FROM HER LIFE NOW.

11:57.090 --> 11:58.534
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE ERASED
FROM HER LIFE,

11:58.640 --> 11:59.709
'CAUSE YOU WON'T LET
THAT HAPPEN.

11:59.820 --> 12:02.812
- YOU KNOW WHAT
THE WORST PART IS?

12:02.920 --> 12:04.672
I'M PUTTING HER
IN THE MIDDLE OF IT.

12:04.790 --> 12:06.576
SO WHAT AM I DOING?

12:06.690 --> 12:08.851
I FEEL LIKE A BIG BABY,
YOU KNOW.

12:08.960 --> 12:11.963
I MADE YOU COME, AND I HAVE
TO GET MY DAUGHTER BACK

12:12.070 --> 12:13.822
AND YOU CAN'T DO THAT AND...

12:13.940 --> 12:15.931
I SHOULD HAVE
NEVER LET IT GET THIS FAR.

12:16.040 --> 12:18.270
THAT'S WHAT
I SHOULD-A NOT...DONE.

12:18.390 --> 12:19.971
- I THINK IT'S VERY NOBLE.

12:20.080 --> 12:23.117
LOOK, YOU'RE GONNA SHOW UP
FOR HER, LIKE YOU HAVE BEEN.

12:23.220 --> 12:25.632
WHICH IS MORE
THAN MY KIDS' FATHER DOES,

12:25.740 --> 12:26.968
YOU KNOW, FOR THEM.

12:27.090 --> 12:28.352
- WHY DO YOU KEEP LOOKING
AT YOUR PHONE?

12:28.470 --> 12:30.153
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN?
- IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

12:30.260 --> 12:32.182
'CAUSE I SEE YOU LOOKING
AT THAT OVER AND OVER AGAIN.

12:32.300 --> 12:33.699
- THERE'S A LOT
OF CALLS COMING IN.

12:33.820 --> 12:35.151
- I CAUSED
LIKE, TROUBLE, THERE, RIGHT?

12:35.270 --> 12:36.988
THERE'S TROUBLE IN CANDY LAND,
I CAN TELL.

12:37.100 --> 12:40.024
- WHAT DOES THAT EVEN MEAN?
- YOUR BOYFRIEND.

12:40.130 --> 12:41.119
- MY FIANCEE?
- YEAH, I APOLOGIZE.

12:41.240 --> 12:43.060
- LOOK, DON'T START APOLOGIZING
NOW.

12:43.170 --> 12:44.239
- ALL RIGHT, HERE, COME ON.

12:44.340 --> 12:46.160
TO, UM...
FOR YOU.

12:46.280 --> 12:48.828
TO SARAH, FOR THANK--
FOR HELPING ME.

12:48.940 --> 12:51.659
ALL RIGHT...
JUST...

12:51.770 --> 12:54.147
JUST--YOU STAY THERE,
I'LL DO IT.

12:54.250 --> 12:56.832
- [laughs drunkenly]
I DON'T KNOW WHY IT'S SO FUNNY.

12:56.940 --> 12:58.453
- LOOK AT YOURSELF. SEE?

12:58.570 --> 13:00.322
- [laughs louder]

13:00.430 --> 13:01.636
UGH.
- QUIET DOWN.

13:01.740 --> 13:03.082
'CAUSE I CAN'T FIND THE ROOMS.

13:03.190 --> 13:04.464
[laughing]

13:04.570 --> 13:05.946
- I HAVE TO LEAN ON YOU,
BECAUSE I'M FALLING OVER.

13:06.060 --> 13:07.391
- HERE, ALL RIGHT.

13:07.510 --> 13:08.636
- I FEEL LIKE YOU'RE HAULING ME,
LIKE POTATOES.

13:08.750 --> 13:10.081
- YOU THINK I'M HOLDING YOU UP,

13:10.200 --> 13:11.781
BUT I'M ACTUALLY KEEPING MYSELF
FROM FALLING FORWARD.

13:11.890 --> 13:12.811
- [laughs]

13:12.930 --> 13:13.544
[gasps softly]

13:13.650 --> 13:17.472
[sighs]

13:17.580 --> 13:19.400
HI.

13:19.520 --> 13:21.488
- HI.

13:24.320 --> 13:27.141
UH...

13:32.600 --> 13:33.669
- WHAT WAS THAT, SARAH?

13:33.770 --> 13:35.351
- NOTHING.
THAT WAS NOTHING.

13:35.460 --> 13:36.597
I FELL IN THE HALLWAY...
- IT DIDN'T LOOK LIKE NOTHING.

13:36.710 --> 13:38.257
- BECAUSE I'M DRUNK, OKAY...

13:38.360 --> 13:39.918
- RIGHT, AND YOU HAD YOUR ARM
AROUND HIM, AND YOUR SHOES OFF.

13:40.020 --> 13:41.328
- I JUST WAS HOLDING ON
BECAUSE I WAS DRUNK.

13:41.440 --> 13:42.884
- AND HE'S WALKING YOU
TO YOUR ROOM?

13:42.990 --> 13:44.366
- HE WASN'T.
THE BAR'S RIGHT THERE.

13:44.470 --> 13:45.880
HE JUST--YEAH, WE JUST--
HE WAS JUST WALKING ME...

13:45.990 --> 13:47.127
- AND SO WHAT WAS GOING
TO HAPPEN AFTER THIS?

13:47.240 --> 13:48.434
- NOTHING.

13:48.550 --> 13:49.881
- IF I WASN'T HERE,
WHAT WAS GOING TO HAPPEN?

13:50.000 --> 13:51.069
- NOTHING.
NOTHING WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

13:51.170 --> 13:52.068
- THAT'S
NOT WHAT IT LOOKED LIKE.

13:52.170 --> 13:53.649
- HOW CAN YOU EVEN SAY THAT?

13:53.760 --> 13:55.068
- BECAUSE YOU WERE LAUGHING
AND YOU WERE ALL OVER HIM!

13:55.170 --> 13:56.307
- I WAS JUST LAUGHING!

13:56.420 --> 13:57.819
- THIS IS WHAT YOU CHOSE
INSTEAD OF

13:57.940 --> 13:59.419
TO COME AWAY WITH ME
FOR THE WEEKEND.

13:59.520 --> 14:02.034
YOU CHOSE TO BE HERE FOR WORK.
AND THEN I COME HERE,

14:02.150 --> 14:05.381
AND I SEE YOU, LIKE, ON--
IN, LIKE, A ROMANTIC--

14:05.490 --> 14:06.184
- IT WASN'T ROMANTIC! NO!

14:06.290 --> 14:07.666
- LIKE I WALKED IN ON YOU GUYS!

14:07.770 --> 14:08.873
- NO, YOU DIDN'T WALK IN
ON ANYTHING!

14:08.980 --> 14:10.015
- I INTERRUPTED
YOUR SPECIAL, PRIVATE--

14:10.120 --> 14:11.018
- HOW CAN YOU SAY THAT?

14:11.120 --> 14:12.564
- I WOULD NEVER DO THAT TO--

14:12.670 --> 14:13.807
- YOU KNOW WHAT'S THE STUPIDEST
THING ABOUT ALL OF THIS?

14:13.920 --> 14:14.807
- WHAT?

14:14.920 --> 14:16.319
- IS THAT I FELT REALLY BAD

14:16.440 --> 14:18.499
THAT I CALLED YOU
A "LOUSY FIANCEE."

14:18.610 --> 14:19.816
AND I GOT YOUR MESSAGE,
AND YOU SOUNDED REALLY SAD.

14:19.920 --> 14:22.855
SO I MADE UP SOME EXCUSE

14:22.960 --> 14:24.120
AND GOT ON A PLANE
TO COME APOLOGIZE TO YOU,

14:24.240 --> 14:26.959
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
THAT'S WHAT WE SHOULD DO.

14:27.070 --> 14:28.753
COME BACK AND FIGURE IT OUT
WITH SARAH.

14:28.860 --> 14:30.828
AND THEN I COME BACK,
AND HERE--

14:30.930 --> 14:32.170
AND HERE YOU ARE WITH...

14:32.280 --> 14:33.201
THIS--YOUR BOSS.
- NO, NO.

14:33.320 --> 14:34.719
- YOU KNOW ME!
- BECAUSE--

14:34.830 --> 14:36.832
- YOU KNOW THAT I WOULD NOT
DO SOMETHING LIKE THAT!

14:36.940 --> 14:38.248
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

14:38.360 --> 14:39.839
- CAN WE PLEASE JUST--
JUST FORGET IT!

14:39.940 --> 14:41.316
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I NEED TO GET SOME AIR.

14:41.430 --> 14:43.250
- NO, PLEASE DON'T GO,
YOU'RE SCARING ME.

14:43.360 --> 14:46.079
JUST COME HERE FOR ONE SECOND.
- I CAN'T TALK TO YOU RIGHT NOW.

14:47.570 --> 14:49.253
[door shuts]

14:50.610 --> 14:53.647
[power tools clamoring]

14:59.450 --> 15:00.371
- MORNING, GUYS.

15:00.480 --> 15:01.856
- MORNING, BOSS.
- HEY, WHAT'S UP?

15:01.970 --> 15:03.096
- IS THIS THE STUFF
THAT JUST CAME IN?

15:03.210 --> 15:04.131
- YEP.
- HOW IS IT?

15:04.240 --> 15:06.447
- SUCKS.
- YEAH, OKAY.

15:06.560 --> 15:09.347
both:
MORNING.

15:13.600 --> 15:15.420
- [chuckles]

15:15.530 --> 15:17.760
- SORRY ABOUT THAT, I--

15:17.880 --> 15:19.393
[bangs on wood]

15:19.500 --> 15:20.660
- HOW'S IT GOING?

15:20.780 --> 15:22.111
- IT'S, UH...

15:23.710 --> 15:25.325
IT'S A LEARNING CURVE.
- YEAH.

15:25.440 --> 15:28.432
STILL GETTING THE HANG OF IT.
- IT'S ALL RIGHT.

15:28.540 --> 15:30.405
JUST TAKE YOUR TIME WITH IT,
YOU KNOW?

15:30.510 --> 15:32.057
NOT RACING THESE GUYS.

15:32.170 --> 15:34.479
MAKE SURE YOU MEASURE IT OUT
BEFORE YOU...

15:34.580 --> 15:35.569
HACK IT.

15:35.690 --> 15:38.272
- YES, SIR.
- YEAH.

15:38.380 --> 15:40.587
- RYAN, YOU CAN
JUST CALL ME JOEL.

15:40.690 --> 15:43.250
- OKAY.

15:43.350 --> 15:46.035
- OKAY, COME--
COME SEE ME Al-TER.

15:46.150 --> 15:48.004
- OKAY.
- ALL RIGHT.

15:48.110 --> 15:49.623
- JOEL, HOW COME YOU NEVER ASK
HOW I'M FEELING, MAN?

15:49.740 --> 15:50.900
I GOT NEEDS TOO, BRO.

15:51.010 --> 15:52.329
- THAT'S 'CAUSE I DON'T CARE
ABOUT YOUR NEEDS.

15:52.430 --> 15:54.250
I THOUGHT I MADE THAT CLEAR.

15:54.360 --> 15:55.497
- HEY, JOEL, IT'S MY TIME
OF THE MONTH.

15:55.600 --> 15:57.773
- YEAH, YEAH.
[overlapping shouts]

15:57.880 --> 15:59.086
IS THAT WHY YOU'RE SO MOODY?
- HOLD ME.

15:59.190 --> 16:02.079
HOLD ME, JOEL!

16:02.200 --> 16:04.600
- [chuckling]

16:04.720 --> 16:06.506
- NICE JOB, ROOKIE.

16:11.310 --> 16:13.619
- HEY.
- THE BOOTH IS SET UP.

16:13.730 --> 16:15.300
WE SHOULD GET THERE
IN THE NEXT TEN MINUTES.

16:15.420 --> 16:17.103
- YOU GOT, UM, ANY ASPIRIN?

16:17.210 --> 16:19.269
- I DON'T THINK SO.
- NOTHING IN THAT WHOLE BAG?

16:19.390 --> 16:20.140
- I DON'T--

16:20.250 --> 16:22.172
- JUST A LITTLE ASPIRIN?

16:22.290 --> 16:23.666
I ALSO WANT
TO TELL YOU WHAT I WAS THINKING.

16:23.770 --> 16:25.214
I WAS THINKING, UM,

16:25.320 --> 16:27.948
I'M GONNA ASK RUBY IF SHE WANTS
TO COME TO BERKELEY.

16:28.050 --> 16:30.109
YOU KNOW, LIVE WITH ME.

16:30.230 --> 16:31.948
- COFFEE, DEAR?
- YES, GOD, PLEASE, YES.

16:32.060 --> 16:34.779
- SAME CHECK?
- THAT'S FINE.

16:34.890 --> 16:36.334
- NO, NO, IT'S--
IT'S SEPARATE.

16:36.440 --> 16:38.954
- OKAY.

16:39.060 --> 16:40.743
- WHAT DO YOU THINK OF THAT?

16:43.310 --> 16:44.402
- WHAT?
- WHAT DO YOU THINK?

16:44.520 --> 16:46.238
ABOUT RUBY COMING
TO LIVE WITH ME.

16:46.350 --> 16:47.544
SHE SHOULD HAVE
THE CHOICE, RIGHT?

16:47.660 --> 16:48.820
I MEAN...

16:48.930 --> 16:50.306
THAT'S ONLY--
- YOU KNOW, HANK?

16:50.420 --> 16:53.480
IT'S NOT MY JOB TO FIX YOU.

17:02.050 --> 17:04.325
- OKAY, UH...
- I'M SORRY.

17:04.430 --> 17:06.842
I HAD A, UH,
EXCEPTIONALLY BAD NIGHT.

17:06.950 --> 17:10.818
AND, UM,
MARK IS NOT ANSWERING...

17:10.920 --> 17:13.639
THE PHONE.

17:13.750 --> 17:15.718
- YEAH, YOU KNOW, I GET IT.

17:15.820 --> 17:16.787
I GET IT.

17:16.890 --> 17:17.788
- YOU KNOW, I HAVE A LIFE,

17:17.890 --> 17:19.585
AND I'M NOT FOCUSED ON IT.

17:19.690 --> 17:21.920
'CAUSE I'M THINKING
ABOUT YOUR LIFE.

17:22.040 --> 17:23.610
IT DOESN'T REALLY MAKE
ANY SENSE.

17:23.730 --> 17:27.177
- YEAH, I GOT IT.

17:27.280 --> 17:30.215
- YOU'RE A VERY NICE GUY,
BUT I NEED TO--

17:30.320 --> 17:31.628
- SAID, "I GOT IT."

17:31.740 --> 17:33.423
UH, LET'S GO.

17:33.530 --> 17:37.523
- AND I'M FEELING SO SMALL

17:37.640 --> 17:40.017
AGAINST THAT BIG SKY
TONIGHT

17:40.120 --> 17:42.463
TONIGHT, ALL RIGHT

17:54.000 --> 17:55.444
- CROSBY.

17:58.830 --> 18:00.798
- WHAT IS IT?
- SHE'S HERE.

18:00.900 --> 18:05.280
[silence]

18:05.390 --> 18:07.312
- HEY, THAT--
THAT WAS PERFECT.

18:07.430 --> 18:08.624
- THANKS, I--
YOU KNOW,

18:08.740 --> 18:10.321
I RAN OUT OF BREATH
ON THE HARMONICA.

18:10.430 --> 18:11.738
IF WE COULD JUST DO IT AGAIN,
IT'D BE GREAT.

18:11.840 --> 18:13.250
- OKAY, UH, GREAT.

18:13.360 --> 18:14.634
UH, YOU WANNA TAKE FIVE,

18:14.740 --> 18:16.150
AND CATCH YOUR BREATH,
AND THEN WE'LL...

18:16.260 --> 18:19.263
- I'M GOOD, IF YOU WANT
TO GO NOW.

18:19.370 --> 18:20.951
- YEAH, DO--YEAH.

18:21.060 --> 18:23.028
YEAH, UM--
- SORRY, YOU CAN'T--CROSBY!

18:23.130 --> 18:24.677
- CAN YOU JUST--I DON'T KNOW--
TALK TO HIM.

18:24.790 --> 18:26.712
[door shuts]

18:30.480 --> 18:31.299
- HI.

18:31.420 --> 18:32.967
- HI.
- [laughs nervously]

18:33.070 --> 18:34.935
[scoffs]
HE'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

18:35.040 --> 18:36.132
- OH.

18:36.250 --> 18:37.649
- [sighs]

18:37.770 --> 18:40.694
I'M SURE CROSBY WILL BE HERE
IN JUST A MINUTE.

18:40.800 --> 18:42.358
I REALLY APPRECIATE
YOU MAKING THE TIME.

18:42.460 --> 18:43.563
I'M JUST HAPPY
THAT WE COULD SIT DOWN...

18:43.670 --> 18:44.898
- DO YOU KNOW THAT
THAT POWER STRIP

18:45.020 --> 18:46.146
IS COMPLETELY OVERLOADED?

18:46.260 --> 18:48.319
I SERIOUSLY DOUBT
THAT THE WIRING

18:48.430 --> 18:49.499
IN THIS BUILDING
IS UP TO CODE.

18:49.610 --> 18:50.679
DO YOU KNOW
THAT YOU COULD HAVE

18:50.780 --> 18:52.293
A THREE-ALARM FIRE
WITHIN MINUTES?

18:52.400 --> 18:53.674
- I CAN ASSURE YOU
ALL THE WIRING IS UP TO CODE.

18:53.780 --> 18:55.771
BUT THANK YOU VERY MUCH
FOR POINTING THAT OUT.

18:55.890 --> 18:57.744
I'LL LOOK INTO IT AND MAKE SURE
THAT IT'S NOT OVERLOADED.

18:57.860 --> 18:58.929
- YOU'RE WELCOME.
- HEY.

18:59.030 --> 18:59.928
- CROSBY.
- SORRY I'M LATE.

19:00.030 --> 19:01.065
I WAS WORKING WITH GLEN HANSARD.

19:01.170 --> 19:02.137
BUT SINCE YOU'RE EARLY,

19:02.240 --> 19:03.514
THAT DEFINITELY
TAKES PRECEDENCE.

19:03.620 --> 19:06.828
- ALL RIGHT, UM,
SO WE'RE ALL HERE.

19:06.930 --> 19:09.137
AND I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU'VE HAD

19:09.250 --> 19:10.342
A MISUNDERSTANDING
WITH MY BROTHER.

19:10.450 --> 19:11.838
- YOUR BROTHER, YOU,

19:11.940 --> 19:13.032
EVERYBODY WHO COMES IN AND OUT
OF THIS BUILDING.

19:13.150 --> 19:14.412
YOU PEOPLE ARE AWFUL.

19:14.530 --> 19:17.738
I WOULDN'T EXACTLY CALL THAT
A MISUNDERSTANDING.

19:17.840 --> 19:19.569
- WELL, I THINK THAT IT IS
A MISUNDERSTANDING.

19:19.670 --> 19:20.398
- I TOLD THIS ONE.

19:20.500 --> 19:22.115
LITTERING, SMOKING,

19:22.230 --> 19:24.152
SHOUTING IN THE ALLEY,
PARKING IN MY SPACE.

19:24.260 --> 19:26.125
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

19:26.230 --> 19:27.128
- OKAY, WELL, THESE ARE
ALL THE ITEMS

19:27.230 --> 19:28.458
WE WANT TO ADDRESS,

19:28.580 --> 19:29.535
AND AGAIN, I WANTED
TO DO THIS SOONER.

19:29.650 --> 19:31.094
I JUST--I COULDN'T DO IT...

19:31.200 --> 19:32.474
- OH, YEAH?
YOU KNOW WHEN THINGS GET DONE?

19:32.580 --> 19:33.649
WHEN PEOPLE FEEL THREATENED.

19:33.750 --> 19:35.069
OTHERWISE, THEY WALK
ALL OVER YOU.

19:35.170 --> 19:36.751
CASE IN POINT.

19:36.860 --> 19:38.236
- ALL RIGHT, I CAN ASSURE YOU
THAT'S NOT THE CASE, HERE.

19:38.340 --> 19:39.853
I'VE HAD
SOME PRESSING FAMILY MATTERS

19:39.970 --> 19:41.756
TO DEAL WITH, BUT I'M HERE
TO DEAL WITH IT NOW, AND--

19:41.870 --> 19:42.962
- FAMILY MATTERS?

19:43.070 --> 19:44.207
- HIS WIFE HAS
BREAST CANCER, SO...

19:44.320 --> 19:45.548
- CROSBY!

19:45.660 --> 19:48.140
PLEASE, SOME RESPECT
FOR THE FAMILY PRIVACY.

19:48.250 --> 19:50.525
- SHE'S ACTING
LIKE IT'S TRIVIAL.

19:50.630 --> 19:51.938
TELL HER SHE'S GOING
THROUGH CHEMO.

19:52.050 --> 19:53.733
- IT'S TRUE.

19:53.840 --> 19:55.592
SHE'S GOING THROUGH CHEMO
AND, AS YOU CAN IMAGINE,

19:55.710 --> 19:57.154
IT'S BEEN A VERY DIFFICULT TIME.

19:57.260 --> 19:58.181
- MM-HMM.
- ALL RIGHT.

19:58.300 --> 19:59.187
- I HAD THAT.

19:59.300 --> 20:02.292
LAST YEAR.

20:05.850 --> 20:08.057
- WELL, I'M VERY SORRY.
I KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE,

20:08.170 --> 20:09.649
AND IT'S A DIFFICULT THING,

20:09.760 --> 20:10.545
AND I'M VERY SORRY YOU HAD
TO GO THROUGH THAT.

20:10.650 --> 20:12.857
NOW, I JUST WANT TO MAKE SURE--

20:12.970 --> 20:14.449
- WAIT A SECOND.
- WHAT?

20:14.550 --> 20:16.518
- YOU'RE NOT TRYING
TO USE YOUR WIFE'S CANCER

20:16.620 --> 20:18.372
TO GET ME
TO DROP MY COMPLAINT, ARE YOU?

20:18.490 --> 20:19.718
- NO.
- OH, ADAM!

20:19.830 --> 20:21.240
- OF COURSE NOT.
- THAT'D BE REALLY CRASS.

20:21.350 --> 20:22.692
- IS THAT WHATI;KY)OU'RE DOING?

20:22.800 --> 20:24.108
I AM SIMPLY TRYING TO...

20:24.220 --> 20:25.596
- WOW!
- SOLVE THESE NEIGHBORLY ISSUES.

20:25.700 --> 20:27.588
- OKAY, YOU KNOW WHAT?
- PLEASE SIT DOWN.

20:27.700 --> 20:31.329
- I'LL SEE YOU
AT THE CITY COUNCIL MEETING.

20:31.430 --> 20:32.397
- DRIVE SAFE, MAUREEN.

20:32.500 --> 20:34.559
- YOU KNOW MY NAME.

20:36.920 --> 20:38.888
- WELL, THAT WAS IMPRESSIVE.

20:38.990 --> 20:42.949
THAT WAS LIKE A MASTER CLASS
IN CONFLICT RESOLUTION.

20:51.310 --> 20:54.279
[motor turns off]
- [sighs]

20:54.390 --> 20:55.618
- HI, SORRY.

20:55.730 --> 20:56.139
I DIDN'T WANT TO SCARE YOU.

20:56.250 --> 20:58.070
- HI.

20:58.180 --> 20:59.317
- I'VE BEEN LOOKING ALL OVER
FOR YOU.

20:59.430 --> 21:00.692
- YOU FOUND ME.

21:00.810 --> 21:01.458
[beep]

21:01.570 --> 21:03.288
- THE LAST PLACE I LOOKED.

21:03.400 --> 21:04.492
[nervous laughter]

21:04.600 --> 21:05.942
WHAT DID YOU DO ALL DAY?

21:06.050 --> 21:07.290
- THIS.

21:07.400 --> 21:09.083
I--BEFORE,
I WAS WALKING AROUND,

21:09.190 --> 21:13.194
TRYING TO...FIGURE OUT
WHAT I'M DOING.

21:13.300 --> 21:14.335
I WAS GOING
TO BUY A TICKET BACK,

21:14.440 --> 21:17.091
BUT I DIDN'T REALLY FEEL LIKE...

21:17.200 --> 21:18.883
GOING BACK
TO MY APARTMENT RIGHT NOW.

21:19.000 --> 21:22.549
SO...

21:22.660 --> 21:24.969
I JUST THOUGHT I'D COME HERE.

21:25.070 --> 21:27.413
[beeping]

21:27.520 --> 21:31.900
- OUR APARTMENT.

21:32.010 --> 21:33.864
I'M SO SORRY.

21:33.980 --> 21:35.971
I'M SO SORRY.

21:36.080 --> 21:37.661
YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

21:37.770 --> 21:39.590
NOTHING WAS GONNA HAPPEN
LAST NIGHT.

21:39.710 --> 21:40.802
NOTHING WAS GONNA HAPPEN.

21:40.920 --> 21:43.115
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.

21:43.230 --> 21:44.948
- OKAY.

21:47.020 --> 21:48.260
OKAY.

21:48.370 --> 21:52.261
- I'M SORRY
ABOUT THIS WHOLE THING.

21:52.380 --> 21:53.859
- ME TOO.

21:53.960 --> 21:55.689
CAN WE HAVE DINNER...

21:55.790 --> 21:58.725
TONIGHT?

21:58.830 --> 21:59.922
- YEAH.

22:00.040 --> 22:01.029
- [whispers]
YEAH.

22:01.140 --> 22:02.823
THANK YOU.

22:02.940 --> 22:05.249
- [curtly]
MM-HMM.

22:05.350 --> 22:06.726
I'LL JUST FINISH THIS,

22:06.840 --> 22:11.664
AND THEN WE CAN GO OUT
SOMEWHERE.

22:11.770 --> 22:13.328
- I LOVE YOU.

22:13.430 --> 22:17.878
[beeping]

22:17.990 --> 22:19.946
- ME TOO.

22:24.860 --> 22:26.714
I, UH...

22:26.820 --> 22:28.060
LET ME JUST FINISH THIS UP...
- YEAH.

22:28.170 --> 22:29.569
- AND I'LL...

22:29.690 --> 22:31.749
AND THEN I'LL JUST SEE YOU
FOR DINNER.

22:31.860 --> 22:33.748
both:
OKAY.

22:36.700 --> 22:37.621
[beep]

22:49.470 --> 22:52.564
[doorbell rings]

22:55.200 --> 22:57.407
- [under breath]
OKAY...

22:57.510 --> 22:58.408
[knock on door]

22:58.510 --> 23:00.091
COMING!

23:04.550 --> 23:05.892
both:
HI.

23:06.000 --> 23:06.409
- HOW ARE YOU?

23:06.520 --> 23:08.988
- MM...GOOD.

23:09.110 --> 23:12.796
YOU KNOW, JUST HAVING
A LITTLE...ME TIME.

23:12.900 --> 23:14.071
- YEAH.
- THE KIDS ARE OUT.

23:14.180 --> 23:16.557
AND I WAS JUST, LIKE...

23:16.670 --> 23:18.217
[sighs]
RELAXING.

23:18.320 --> 23:20.140
- COOL, YEAH, UM...

23:20.260 --> 23:21.147
- I JUST--
COME IN.

23:21.260 --> 23:22.807
- OKAY, THANKS.
- SURE.

23:22.910 --> 23:25.947
- I WANTED TO TALK TO YOU
ABOUT SOMETHING.

23:26.050 --> 23:28.223
- YEAH.
- SO, UM...

23:28.330 --> 23:30.127
YOU'RE SUCH A GOOD MOM.
- MM-HMM.

23:30.230 --> 23:32.471
- YOU'RE MY GURU.

23:32.580 --> 23:33.854
- OH, YOU'RE--
THAT'S NICE.

23:33.960 --> 23:35.507
- WELL, YEAH,
YOU'RE ALWAYS GOOD WITH...

23:35.620 --> 23:36.951
- I'M SORRY, I'M SORRY.
- MOM STUFF.

23:37.070 --> 23:40.164
- I'M--I'M SMOKING POT.

23:40.280 --> 23:41.474
- I KNOW.
- I WAS JUST DOPING IT UP.

23:41.590 --> 23:42.750
AND I'M REALLY SORRY.
- I KNOW.

23:42.860 --> 23:44.202
- I MEAN, I KNOW I'M NOT,
LIKE...

23:44.310 --> 23:45.413
I SHOULDN'T HAVE LIED.

23:45.520 --> 23:46.441
DID I? I DIDN'T
REALLY EVEN LIE.

23:46.560 --> 23:47.868
- NO, YOU DIDN'T, NO.

23:47.970 --> 23:49.699
AND YOU DON'T EVEN HAVE
TO EXPLAIN YOURSELF.

23:49.800 --> 23:52.382
I'M GLAD THAT YOU'RE GETTING
HELP WITH THE CHEMO.

23:52.500 --> 23:54.286
- OH, YEAH, AND IT'S GREAT.
- THAT'S GREAT.

23:54.390 --> 23:55.254
- I FEEL GOOD.

23:55.360 --> 23:56.668
- GOOD.

23:56.780 --> 23:58.839
- WHY DON'T YOU HAVE A SEAT.
- OKAY.

23:58.950 --> 24:00.986
UM...
- I'M JUST GONNA GET SOME WATER.

24:01.090 --> 24:02.739
- OKAY, HERE'S MY PROBLEM.

24:02.850 --> 24:05.671
VICTOR IS REALLY BEHIND
IN SCHOOL.

24:05.780 --> 24:06.815
- GOT IT.

24:06.920 --> 24:10.026
- TURNS OUT HE MISSED
47 DAYS LAST YEAR.

24:10.130 --> 24:13.543
SO HE HAS NO IDEA
WHAT'S HAPPENING IN CLASS.

24:13.650 --> 24:15.447
UM, AND THEN,
SINCE HE CAN'T KEEP UP,

24:15.550 --> 24:16.994
HE FEELS STUPID.

24:17.110 --> 24:19.726
AND THEN HE REFUSES TO STUDY...
- AND IT'S LIKE...

24:19.830 --> 24:21.764
- I'M TUTORING HIM, YOU KNOW.
- YEAH.

24:21.870 --> 24:23.599
- AND I'M GOING OVER
HIS HOMEWORK WITH HIM.

24:23.700 --> 24:25.315
BUT THAT BASICALLY JUST MEANS
I'M DOING IT FOR HIM.

24:25.420 --> 24:27.524
- FOR HIM, YEAH.

24:27.630 --> 24:29.564
- AND... [sighs]
- LIKE YOU'RE DOING IT ALL.

24:29.670 --> 24:31.183
- YEAH.
- MM-HMM.

24:31.290 --> 24:33.258
- AND SO I FEEL LIKE
HE THINKS

24:33.360 --> 24:35.294
HE'S COMING HOME
TO THIS WITCH.

24:35.400 --> 24:36.981
- YOU'RE NOT, YOU'RE NOT.
- I DON'T WANT TO BE THAT WAY.

24:37.090 --> 24:39.467
- I KNOW, BUT I WANT
TO BE NICE, YOU KNOW?

24:39.580 --> 24:41.639
BUT I ALSO JUST REALLY WANT HIM
TO CATCH UP...

24:41.750 --> 24:42.739
- GOTTA CATCH UP.

24:42.860 --> 24:44.816
- YEAH.
- HE HAS TO CATCH UP.

24:44.930 --> 24:46.329
THAT'S ALL THERE IS TO IT.
- YEAH.

24:46.450 --> 24:48.509
- LIKE, HE CAN'T NOT GO
TO SCH--DO IT.

24:48.620 --> 24:51.828
- SO--SO WHAT DO YOU DO?

24:51.930 --> 24:52.897
WITH MAX.

24:53.000 --> 24:54.171
- MAX? WELL, I...

24:54.280 --> 24:56.168
UH...

24:56.280 --> 24:59.488
WELL, TO BE HONEST WITH YOU...

24:59.600 --> 25:00.862
WE BRIBE HIM.

25:00.980 --> 25:02.186
YEAH, IF WERE ON OPRAH...
- OH.

25:02.290 --> 25:03.564
- I WOULD BE LIKE,

25:03.670 --> 25:05.012
"OH, IT'S
AN 'INCENTIVE SYSTEM.'"

25:05.120 --> 25:07.463
BUT IT'S JUST BRIBERY.

25:07.570 --> 25:09.322
- WOW, OKAY.
- YEAH.

25:09.430 --> 25:10.328
- AND THAT WORKS.

25:10.430 --> 25:12.569
- IT WORKS.
- WOW.

25:12.680 --> 25:14.295
- WHERE IS--
NO, IT'S DOWN HERE.

25:14.400 --> 25:16.197
[sighs]

25:16.300 --> 25:17.779
HERE.

25:17.890 --> 25:19.232
- HO!

25:19.340 --> 25:20.614
OH, MY GOODNESS.

25:20.720 --> 25:24.269
- DIFFERENT SHAPES AND SIZES
OF CANDY.

25:24.380 --> 25:27.201
WE HAVE NUGGETS OF FUN.

25:27.310 --> 25:28.891
CHOCOLATEY, CRUNCHY, CHEWY,

25:29.010 --> 25:30.443
TANGIBLE LITTLE TREATS OF JOY.

25:30.560 --> 25:32.209
DELICIOUS.

25:32.320 --> 25:33.389
MMM.

25:33.490 --> 25:34.798
AND IT WORKS.

25:34.910 --> 25:36.457
- IT WORKS?
- YEAH, IT REALLY WORKS.

25:36.560 --> 25:38.596
- [stammers] SO WHAT DO YOU
USE THIS FOR?

25:38.700 --> 25:40.088
- EVERYTHING.
- FOR EVERYTHING?

25:40.190 --> 25:42.704
- I MEAN, LIKE,
TWO GUMMY WORMS FOR HOMEWORK.

25:42.810 --> 25:45.051
TAKE A SHOWER:
THERE'S THREE FISH.

25:45.160 --> 25:46.946
TAKE THE DOG OUT...

25:47.060 --> 25:49.437
AND HE'LL TAKE HIM OUT.
LISTEN TO ME.

25:49.540 --> 25:51.508
WHEN YOU'RE IN THE TRENCHES,
AS A PARENT,

25:51.610 --> 25:53.646
DO NOT FEEL GUILTY
ABOUT THIS, OKAY?

25:53.750 --> 25:55.263
YOU GOTTA DO WHAT YOU GOTTA DO.

25:55.380 --> 25:57.689
AND YOU GOTTA GO
WITH WHAT WORKS.

25:59.790 --> 26:01.997
YOU'RE A GOOD MOM.

26:02.110 --> 26:03.179
- THANKS.

26:03.280 --> 26:04.759
- THE LUNCHEONETTE...

26:04.870 --> 26:06.417
IS A NEIGHBORHOOD LANDMARK.

26:06.530 --> 26:10.899
IT HAS BEEN HERE SINCE 1956,

26:11.010 --> 26:14.252
WHICH IS WHEN LITTLE BUNNIES
FIRST TOOK OVER SAN FRANCISCO.

26:14.360 --> 26:15.839
AMBER!

26:15.950 --> 26:17.326
COULD YOU PLEASE NOT EMAIL
WHILE I'M DOING THIS?

26:17.430 --> 26:19.079
I'M SELF-CONSCIOUS ENOUGH
ALREADY...

26:19.190 --> 26:21.158
- I'M SORRY, BUT I THINK THAT
YOU NEED TO SEE THIS RIGHT NOW.

26:21.260 --> 26:22.704
- WHAT IS THIS?

26:22.820 --> 26:24.538
- WELL, IT'S AN EMAIL
FROM ONE OF OUR NEIGHBORS.

26:24.650 --> 26:26.982
AND, APPARENTLY...

26:27.100 --> 26:29.307
MARLYSE HAS SENT IT
TO A LOT OF PEOPLE.

26:29.410 --> 26:30.502
- IS THAT CROSBY?
- YEAH.

26:30.620 --> 26:32.588
I MEAN,
IT LOOKS LIKE IT TO ME.

26:32.690 --> 26:33.918
[laughs nervously]

26:34.040 --> 26:36.099
- CROSBY, THERE'S
A PICTURE OF YOU

26:36.210 --> 26:38.417
IN THE ALLEY, URINATING.

26:38.520 --> 26:40.317
- I FIND THAT REALLY HARD
TO BELIEVE...

26:40.420 --> 26:42.388
THAT THERE'S A PHOTOGRAPH--
- YOU'RE NOT GONNA LIKE THIS.

26:42.490 --> 26:44.663
BUT, I MEAN,
PRETTY INTENSE EVIDENCE.

26:44.770 --> 26:48.422
- THAT'S YOU.

26:48.530 --> 26:49.804
- OH, YEAH,
I WENT ONE TIME.

26:49.910 --> 26:52.151
I HAD LOCKED UP
AND SET THE ALARM.

26:52.260 --> 26:53.466
AND, THEN, YOU KNOW.

26:53.570 --> 26:54.673
YOU'VE NEVER PEED IN AN ALLEY?

26:54.780 --> 26:55.986
- NO, I DON'T PEE IN ALLEYS.

26:56.090 --> 26:57.227
DO YOU PEE IN ALLEYS?
- NOT LATELY.

26:57.330 --> 26:58.649
- LOOK, SHE DOESN'T EITHER.

26:58.750 --> 27:00.957
- OKAY, I PEE AT YOSEMITE,
WHEN I GO CAMPING.

27:01.060 --> 27:02.743
- WE'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT CAMPING.

27:02.860 --> 27:04.680
WE'RE NOT CAMPING HERE
AT THE LUNCHEONETTE, OKAY?

27:04.790 --> 27:06.303
THIS IS OUR ALLEY.
YOU DON'T PEE IN OUR ALLEY!

27:06.410 --> 27:08.037
- WHY ARE YOU SO MAD AT ME?
I'M NOT THE ENEMY.

27:08.140 --> 27:09.994
- CROSBY, SHE COULD
SHUT US DOWN!

27:10.110 --> 27:12.999
- I HAD TO PEE.

27:13.110 --> 27:15.385
- WHY CAN'T I JUST HAVE
THE CAN DY FIRST?

27:15.490 --> 27:18.004
- BECAUSE THAT'S NOT
THE WAY THE GAME WORKS, BUDDY.

27:18.110 --> 27:20.385
OKAY, SO ONE CORRECT QUESTION:

27:20.500 --> 27:21.694
ONE PIECE OF CANDY.

27:21.810 --> 27:24.358
- THIS IS
THE STUPIDEST GAME EVER.

27:24.470 --> 27:25.846
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

27:25.950 --> 27:28.327
[sighs]
YOU'RE RIGHT.

27:28.430 --> 27:29.840
AND I'M KINDA HUNGRY, ACTUALLY,

27:29.950 --> 27:31.531
SO I THINK I'LL JUST HAVE
A COUPLE OF THESE.

27:31.650 --> 27:34.050
- OKAY, FINE, I'LL DO IT.

27:34.160 --> 27:36.128
- OKAY.

27:37.510 --> 27:41.378
MM-HMM.

27:41.480 --> 27:43.414
GOOD.

27:43.520 --> 27:45.988
WAIT, THIS--OKAY.
SO CLOSE.

27:46.110 --> 27:48.510
THERE'S ONE THING YOU FORGOT
TO DO.

27:48.630 --> 27:51.178
IT'S WITH THE DECIMAL POINT.

27:51.290 --> 27:53.178
I TALKED TO YOU ABOUT THIS
ON THE LAST ONE.

27:53.290 --> 27:54.177
YOU CAN DO IT.

27:54.290 --> 27:56.429
- NO, I CAN'T DO IT!

27:56.530 --> 27:57.667
I'M NOT LIKE SYDNEY, OKAY?

27:57.770 --> 27:59.419
I'M STUPID!

27:59.530 --> 28:00.633
I'M SORRY, I'M STUPID.

28:00.740 --> 28:01.911
- HEY, YOU'RE NOT STUPID.

28:02.020 --> 28:03.840
- SYDNEY CAN DO
ALL OF MY HOMEWORK,

28:03.950 --> 28:05.394
AND SHE'S A YEAR AND A HALF
YOUNGER THAN ME.

28:05.510 --> 28:07.193
- BUDDY, THERE'S
A BIG DIFFERENCE

28:07.300 --> 28:09.029
BETWEEN BEING STUPID
AND JUST BEING BEHIND.

28:09.130 --> 28:10.643
YOU MISSED A LOT OF SCHOOL,

28:10.750 --> 28:12.331
AND SO WE'RE PLAYING
CATCH-UP HERE, OKAY?

28:12.440 --> 28:13.646
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

28:13.760 --> 28:15.330
WE JUST GOT
TO PUT IN THE TIME, OKAY?

28:15.450 --> 28:17.725
AND IF YOU WORK HARD ON THIS,

28:17.830 --> 28:20.037
I PROMISE YOU,
YOU'RE GONNA ACE THE TEST.

28:20.140 --> 28:23.519
AND IT'S GONNA FEEL AWESOME.

28:23.630 --> 28:26.690
OKAY?

28:26.800 --> 28:28.210
- EXCUSE ME.

28:28.320 --> 28:29.594
DO YOU NEED HELP MOVING THESE,
OVER THERE?

28:29.700 --> 28:31.008
- NO, KID.

28:31.120 --> 28:33.588
YOU WAIT FOR SOMEONE
TO COME HELP YOU, ALL RIGHT?

28:33.710 --> 28:37.055
WE DON'T WANT YOU GETTING
TOO DIRTY.

28:39.680 --> 28:41.819
[clang]

28:43.860 --> 28:45.236
- HEY, KID, LET ME HELP YOU
WITH THOSE.

28:45.340 --> 28:46.955
- I GOT IT.
- WATCH YOUR ANGLE.

28:47.070 --> 28:48.446
- I GOT IT!
- WATCH YOUR ANGLE!

28:48.550 --> 28:49.403
[glass shatters]

28:49.520 --> 28:51.203
- WHOA!

28:51.310 --> 28:51.651
- OOH.

28:51.760 --> 28:53.990
[sighs]

28:54.110 --> 28:55.964
- YOU REALLY SCREWED THE POOCH
ON THAT ONE, KID.

28:56.070 --> 28:58.721
- GUYS,
WHAT IS GOING ON?

28:58.840 --> 29:00.592
THOSE ARE $800 WINDOWS.
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED?

29:00.700 --> 29:04.830
- YOU HIRED HIM.

29:04.950 --> 29:07.111
- I'M--I'M REALLY SORRY.

29:09.540 --> 29:11.360
YOU KNOW, I'M NOT--I...

29:12.470 --> 29:14.119
I SHOULDN'T BE HERE, I...

29:14.230 --> 29:16.642
- RYAN.

29:16.750 --> 29:19.162
HEY, RYAN, I DIDN'T SAY
YOU COULD GO.

29:19.270 --> 29:21.238
RYAN !

29:27.900 --> 29:29.583
- HOLD THAT, PLEASE.

29:29.690 --> 29:30.759
WHOOP.

29:30.870 --> 29:33.316
- HI.
- HEY.

29:33.420 --> 29:35.797
OH, THANKS.
- MM-HMM.

29:39.460 --> 29:41.974
- [sighs]

29:42.090 --> 29:44.354
SO...

29:44.470 --> 29:45.323
GOING TO DINNER?

29:45.430 --> 29:46.397
- YEP.
- YEAH.

29:46.500 --> 29:48.081
- YEP.
- YEAH.

29:48.200 --> 29:49.849
YEAH, I'M GOING
A LITTLE LATER ON

29:49.960 --> 29:53.885
WITH, UH, MY DAUGHTER.

29:53.990 --> 29:56.618
HEY...CAN I SAY SOMETHING?

29:56.720 --> 30:00.167
SARAH HAS JUST BEEN
REALLY HELPFUL,

30:00.280 --> 30:02.373
YOU KNOW, LIKE A SHOULDER
TO LEAN ON.

30:02.490 --> 30:05.209
- OH.
- YEAH.

30:05.320 --> 30:07.140
YEAH, I MEAN,
SHE'S BEEN GREAT.

30:07.250 --> 30:10.219
SHE KNEW THIS WHOLE THING WAS
A SHAM, PROFESSIONALLY, AND...

30:10.320 --> 30:13.073
- A SHAM?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN, A SHAM?

30:13.190 --> 30:16.978
- I MEAN, I JUST,
I BOOKED THIS JOB AS AN EXCUSE

30:17.090 --> 30:18.978
JUST TO GET FACE-TO-FACE
WITH MY DAUGHTER.

30:19.090 --> 30:20.364
- AND SARAH KNEW THAT?

30:20.470 --> 30:22.506
- YEAH, YEAH, UH...

30:22.610 --> 30:25.078
UH...

30:25.200 --> 30:26.428
I GUESS.

30:26.540 --> 30:28.360
BUT THE POINT IS,
EVEN THOUGH SHE KNEW THAT,

30:28.480 --> 30:29.367
SHE CAME ANYWAY, TO HELP.

30:29.480 --> 30:30.959
both :
YEAH.

30:31.070 --> 30:32.139
- BUT, I GUESS,
WHAT I'M TRYING TO SAY IS

30:32.240 --> 30:34.959
YOU KNOW, MAYBE CUT HER
A LITTLE SLACK.

30:35.070 --> 30:36.549
[elevator dings]
- I SHOULD CUT HER SOME SLACK?

30:36.660 --> 30:37.684
[door opens]

30:37.800 --> 30:38.789
- YEAH, MAYBE.

30:38.900 --> 30:40.379
A LITTLE.

30:40.490 --> 30:43.596
- WELL, MAYBE YOU SHOULD MIND
YOUR OWN BUSINESS.

30:49.810 --> 30:50.765
[door opens]

30:50.880 --> 30:54.043
HI.
- OOH.

30:54.160 --> 30:55.252
[door shuts]
ROUGH?

30:55.370 --> 30:57.986
- OH.

30:58.090 --> 30:59.671
NOT THAT BAD.

30:59.780 --> 31:00.712
- NAH?

31:00.820 --> 31:02.435
- HE TRIED.

31:02.550 --> 31:04.302
HE'S GONNA HAVE ROTTEN TEETH,
BUT HE TRIED.

31:04.410 --> 31:07.265
- WELL, MAYBE THE SUGAR BUZZ
HELPS HIS STUDYING.

31:09.550 --> 31:12.678
- YOU KNOW, HE TOLD ME,
HE THINKS HE'S STUPID.

31:12.800 --> 31:14.756
- UM...

31:14.870 --> 31:16.553
WHO KNOWS IF HE MEANT IT.

31:16.660 --> 31:18.139
I REMEMBER BEING THAT AGE.

31:18.250 --> 31:22.425
I'D RATHER PULL OUT
MY FINGERNAILS THAN DO MATH.

31:22.530 --> 31:24.009
- BABY, YOU DIDN'T SEE--

31:24.120 --> 31:28.250
HE BELIEVES IT.

31:28.360 --> 31:29.736
NO ONE'S EVER TOLD HIM
THAT HE'S SMART.

31:29.850 --> 31:31.636
I CAN TELL.

31:31.750 --> 31:32.739
AND NO ONE'S EVER TOLD HIM

31:32.850 --> 31:34.579
THAT IT'S IMPORTANT TO STUDY.

31:34.680 --> 31:36.193
- YEAH.

31:36.300 --> 31:39.474
- IF I COULD JUST WILL HIM
TO ACE THIS TEST TOMORROW.

31:39.580 --> 31:42.788
I JUST WANT HIM
TO FEEL SMART, YOU KNOW?

31:42.900 --> 31:46.688
- ONE TEST IS NOT
GONNA DO THAT, HONEY.

31:46.800 --> 31:49.348
- IT COULD STOP
THE STREAK, MAYBE.

31:52.320 --> 31:54.174
EVERY TIME I TRY
TO CONNECT WITH HIM,

31:54.290 --> 31:56.042
HE...

31:56.150 --> 31:59.256
PUSHES ME AWAY.

32:01.190 --> 32:04.318
I DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS GONNA BE THIS HARD.

32:13.550 --> 32:17.782
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA GET?

32:17.900 --> 32:19.686
- UM...

32:19.790 --> 32:22.065
[sighs]

32:22.180 --> 32:24.512
I, UH, I'M SORRY.

32:24.630 --> 32:26.723
I, UH, I RAN INTO HANK
IN THE ELEVATOR,

32:26.840 --> 32:27.829
ON THE WAY DOWN.

32:27.940 --> 32:30.500
AND, UH...

32:30.600 --> 32:34.388
HE SAID THAT--
THAT THIS WHOLE JOB

32:34.500 --> 32:36.912
WAS A SHAM.

32:37.020 --> 32:38.908
- NO, THAT'S NOT--

32:39.020 --> 32:40.396
- HE SAID THAT IT WAS, UH...

32:40.510 --> 32:41.397
IT WAS A SHAM

32:41.510 --> 32:43.466
AND THAT HE REALLY BOOKED
THE JOB

32:43.580 --> 32:45.502
SO THAT HE COULD TALK
TO HIS DAUGHTER

32:45.610 --> 32:47.089
FACE-TO-FACE, AND...

32:47.200 --> 32:48.508
- MAYBE, BUT IT DOESN'T MEAN
IT'S A SHAM.

32:48.620 --> 32:50.508
- YOU KNEW THAT AND...
- IT WAS AN ACTUAL JOB.

32:50.620 --> 32:51.609
- RIGHT.

32:51.720 --> 32:53.449
BUT HE TOLD ME
THAT YOU KNEW

32:53.550 --> 32:56.439
THAT HE NEEDED SOMEONE
TO BE HERE WITH HIM,

32:56.560 --> 33:01.418
AND THAT'S WHY YOU CAME.

33:01.530 --> 33:02.667
HE NEEDED YOU.

33:02.770 --> 33:05.147
MORE--MORE THAN...

33:05.250 --> 33:07.946
THAN I NEEDED YOU.

33:08.050 --> 33:09.494
- I THOUGHT I WAS DOING
THE RIGHT THING,

33:09.600 --> 33:10.771
AND I DIDN'T.

33:10.880 --> 33:11.869
IT WAS THE WRONG--
IT WAS WRONG.

33:11.990 --> 33:13.218
IT'S--

33:13.330 --> 33:16.219
- HE NEEDED YOU LIKE--
LIKE SETH NEEDED YOU.

33:16.330 --> 33:17.365
- SETH'S THE FATHER
OF MY CHILDREN.

33:17.470 --> 33:20.542
- I KNOW, WELL,
WITH SETH, I UNDERSTOOD.

33:20.650 --> 33:22.402
AND HE WAS DEALING
WITH HIS ADDICTION,

33:22.510 --> 33:24.751
AND I LET YOU DO
WHAT YOU WANTED TO DO.

33:24.860 --> 33:27.852
AND I WAITED FOR YOU,
BECAUSE...

33:27.970 --> 33:28.891
WELL, BECAUSE YOU'RE AMAZING,

33:29.000 --> 33:30.820
AND I LOVE YOU,

33:30.930 --> 33:32.932
AND YOU'RE WORTH WAITING FOR.

33:33.040 --> 33:36.077
BUT YOU--YOU--I FEEL LIKE
YOU DO THIS THING,

33:36.180 --> 33:40.696
WHERE EVERY TIME THERE'S
SOMETHING GOOD IN YOUR LIFE,

33:40.810 --> 33:44.564
SOMETHING THAT'S MAKING YOU
FEEL GOOD ABOUT YOURSELF,

33:44.670 --> 33:45.876
OR ANYTHING LIKE THAT,

33:45.980 --> 33:49.154
YOU--YOU JUST RUN AWAY FROM IT.

33:49.260 --> 33:52.229
AND I DON'T KNOW
WHAT THAT IS IN YOU

33:52.340 --> 33:54.365
THAT--THAT CHOSE
TO COME HERE

33:54.480 --> 33:56.948
INSTEAD OF COME
TO THIS WEDDING

33:57.060 --> 33:59.028
WITH YOUR...
FIANCEE.

33:59.140 --> 34:02.268
BUT, I JUST, UH...

34:04.490 --> 34:07.698
I REALLY LOVE YOU,
BUT I CAN'T DO THIS ANYMORE.

34:36.860 --> 34:38.031
GUESS WHAT.

34:38.140 --> 34:41.416
- VICTOR'S NOT TALKING
TO ANYBODY IN CARPOOL.

34:43.180 --> 34:44.795
- HEY, COME HERE.

34:44.910 --> 34:46.901
WHY DON'T YOU SCOOP OUT SOME
OF THESE CHOCOLATE CHIP COOKIES.

34:47.010 --> 34:48.284
- ARE WE GONNA HAVE 'EM
FOR DESSERT?

34:48.390 --> 34:50.972

34:54.850 --> 34:55.771

34:55.880 --> 34:57.768
- YOU ARE A LIAR!

34:57.880 --> 35:01.816
YOU SAID IF I WORKED HARD,
I WAS GONNA PASS THIS TEST.

35:01.920 --> 35:03.091
YOU SAID I WAS GONNA ACE IT.

35:03.200 --> 35:04.952
YOU'RE FULL OF IT!

35:05.060 --> 35:07.472
YOU'RE A LIAR,
AND I'M STUPID.

35:22.670 --> 35:24.592

35:30.260 --> 35:32.945

35:33.060 --> 35:34.709
LISTEN, I KNOW
YOU'RE MAD, BUDDY,

35:34.820 --> 35:35.741
AND I GET THAT.

35:38.920 --> 35:41.332
BUT, LOOK AT THIS.

35:41.440 --> 35:44.443
TWO DAYS AGO, YOU DIDN'T KNOW
HOW TO DO ANY OF THESE.

35:44.550 --> 35:46.472
LOOK HOW MANY YOU GOT RIGHT.

35:46.590 --> 35:48.103
YOU WORKED REALLY HARD ON THIS,

35:48.210 --> 35:51.247
AND I'M PROUD OF YOU, OKAY?

35:52.940 --> 35:56.899
YOU KNOW, IT DOESN'T EVEN MATTER
IF YOU GET 62 OR 92.

35:57.010 --> 36:00.764
I'M ALWAYS GONNA LOVE YOU.

36:05.810 --> 36:09.018

36:30.110 --> 36:32.112
I RECENTLY MOVED

36:32.220 --> 36:34.006
AND I'VE HAD THE MISFORTUNE

36:34.120 --> 36:35.519
OF BEING
THE LUNCHEONETTE'S NEIGHBOR.

36:35.640 --> 36:38.564
BY CONDO AND THE LUNCHEONETTE
SHARE A BACK ALLEY,

36:38.670 --> 36:41.434
WHICH HAS BECOME,
DUE TO THE RECORDING STUDIO,

36:41.540 --> 36:45.158
A HAVEN FOR DRUG USERS,
VAGRANTS, AND OTHER HOOLIGANS.

36:45.270 --> 36:46.714
- OBJECT ION,
THAT IS NOT THE TRUTH.

36:46.820 --> 36:48.959
THERE ARE MUSICIANS
WHO GO OUT IN THE ALLEY

36:49.060 --> 36:50.573
AND OCCASIONALLY HAVE
A CIGARETTE.

36:50.690 --> 36:52.260
- MR. BRAVERMAN,
THIS IS NOT A COURT OF LAW.

36:52.380 --> 36:54.439
YOU'LL GET YOUR CHANCE
TO RESPOND IN JUST A MINUTE.

36:54.550 --> 36:55.585

37:55.060 --> 37:56.220
HI, MARLYSE.
[clears throat]

37:56.340 --> 37:57.955
I ADMIT, I DID PEE
IN THE ALLEY.

37:58.060 --> 37:59.789
UM, AND SHE FILMED IT.

37:59.890 --> 38:01.164
AND I'LL LET YOU GUYS DECIDE
WHICH IS WEIRDER.

38:01.270 --> 38:04.205
UM...UM, LOOK.

38:04.310 --> 38:05.857
I PROBABLY DON'T NEED
TO TELL YOU GUYS THIS,

38:05.970 --> 38:08.621
BUT, UH, SINCE THE LUNCHEONETTE
OPENED ITS DOORS,

38:08.730 --> 38:11.654
SOME OF THE GREAT ROCK LEGENDS
OF ALL TIME HAVE RECORDED THERE:

38:11.770 --> 38:14.170
JIMI HENDRIX AND JANIS JOPLIN.

38:14.290 --> 38:15.939
UM, THE GRATEFUL DEAD.

38:16.050 --> 38:19.804
AND THEY DIDN'T JUST MAKE
GREAT MUSIC THERE,

38:19.910 --> 38:22.879
THEY ALSO CREATED A CULTURE
THAT REALLY CAME

38:22.990 --> 38:25.845
TO DEFINE THE HAIGHT,
AND THE CITY AS A WHOLE.

38:25.950 --> 38:29.192
I MEAN, WE FLEW A TIE-DYE FLAG
AT HALF-MAST

38:29.300 --> 38:30.574
WHEN JERRY GARCIA DIED.

38:30.680 --> 38:32.329
AND I THINK
THAT'S PRETTY COOL OF US.

38:32.440 --> 38:34.374
BUT WHEN MY BROTHER AND I
RESTORED THE LUNCHEONETTE,

38:34.480 --> 38:35.447
WE WEREN'T TRYING TO BE COOL.

38:35.550 --> 38:36.892
UM, WE DID IT

38:37.000 --> 38:38.752
BECAUSE WE BOTH
HAVE FAMILIES TO SUPPORT,

38:38.860 --> 38:41.374
AND WE HAVE EMPLOYEES, AND
WE WANT TO CREATE GREAT MUSIC.

38:41.490 --> 38:42.559
AND WE'D LIKE
TO CONTRIBUTE

38:42.660 --> 38:44.241
