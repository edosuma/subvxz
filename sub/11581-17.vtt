NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system,

00:03.404 --> 00:06.174
sexually based offenses are
considered especially heinous.

00:06.207 --> 00:08.342
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:08.376 --> 00:10.344
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:10.378 --> 00:11.679
are members of an elite squad

00:11.712 --> 00:13.514
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:13.547 --> 00:16.217
These are their stories.

00:18.686 --> 00:19.653
CHUNY:
What do we got?

00:19.687 --> 00:20.554
Six-year-old male.

00:20.588 --> 00:22.323
Stopped breathing
at a church service.

00:22.356 --> 00:24.325
No pulse. Gave him epi
and atropine.

00:24.358 --> 00:26.160
Oh, please.
The boy's dad.

00:26.194 --> 00:28.196
You wait here.

00:30.764 --> 00:32.566
Still no pulse.
Pupils fixed and dilated.

00:32.600 --> 00:33.834
Asystole.

00:33.867 --> 00:35.569
CHUNY:
Push vasopressin and
atropine. Scalpel.

00:37.805 --> 00:39.840
Oh, my God,

00:39.873 --> 00:41.842
what are you doing?
We're trying to
start his heart.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.611
Sir, you need
to wait outside.
No, no, no, no.

00:43.644 --> 00:44.678
Please let me stay
with him.

00:44.712 --> 00:46.214
Did he ingest anything:
poisons,

00:46.247 --> 00:47.581
detergents, drugs?
There was just-just

00:47.615 --> 00:48.682
a glass of
milk before bed.

00:48.716 --> 00:50.084
NURSE:
Vasopressin
and atropine

00:50.118 --> 00:51.552
on board--
still no pulse.

00:51.585 --> 00:52.620
How long's he been down?

00:52.653 --> 00:53.721
Nearly 30 minutes.

00:56.624 --> 00:59.460
You have to help him.

00:59.493 --> 01:01.129
I'm sorry.

01:01.162 --> 01:04.332
There's nothing more we can do.

01:07.768 --> 01:08.669
Paramedics were called

01:08.702 --> 01:10.671
to a service at the Church
of Divine Blessing

01:10.704 --> 01:12.140
just before midnight.

01:12.173 --> 01:14.475
A parishioner said
the kid had stopped breathing.

01:14.508 --> 01:16.477
We did everything we could
to resuscitate him,

01:16.510 --> 01:18.146
but he was DOA.

01:18.179 --> 01:19.713
His name's Jamie Semple.

01:19.747 --> 01:22.883
BENSON:
Did you notify the parents?
Yeah. Dad came in

01:22.916 --> 01:25.319
with the paramedics.
And what's the
cause of death?

01:25.353 --> 01:27.788
I have my suspicions,
but you'd better wait
for the autopsy.

01:27.821 --> 01:30.624
Why us?
Because I think
he was physically abused.

01:30.658 --> 01:33.661
There's these
indentations.

01:33.694 --> 01:36.664
Do you mind if
I take a look?

01:39.400 --> 01:41.635
Partial finger
impressions, and...

01:41.669 --> 01:43.704
is that a ring mark?

01:43.737 --> 01:46.340
Somebody really
squeezed this kid.

01:46.374 --> 01:47.908
Or crushed him.
Hold on. The
ring might have

01:47.941 --> 01:49.843
partial initials-- can
we use your camera?

01:51.412 --> 01:53.681
From the positioning
of the imprint,

01:53.714 --> 01:56.650
the ring...
is on the right ring finger.

01:56.684 --> 01:58.719
Where are the parents?

01:58.752 --> 02:00.721
They're in the waiting area.
They tell you
why they took

02:00.754 --> 02:02.523
their kid to church
in the middle of the night?

02:02.556 --> 02:03.524
Yeah.

02:03.557 --> 02:06.160
They were praying over him.

02:11.199 --> 02:15.469

02:59.580 --> 03:01.282
Mr. and Mrs. Dufoy?

03:01.315 --> 03:04.285
I'm Detective Benson,
this is Detective Tutuola.

03:04.318 --> 03:06.520
We are so sorry
about your loss.

03:06.554 --> 03:09.790
We need to ask you
a few questions.

03:10.824 --> 03:12.560
Can you tell us what happened?

03:12.593 --> 03:14.995
Um, I'm-I'm afraid
I don't know a lot.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.697
I-I was... I work late.

03:16.730 --> 03:19.533
Um, I run a bodega
up on 121st.

03:19.567 --> 03:22.703
Sam was home with Jamie.

03:22.736 --> 03:25.706
Well, he'd been wild,
real wild, all day,

03:25.739 --> 03:29.377
uh, just... throwing fits
like he was possessed.

03:29.410 --> 03:32.713
When he finally quieted down,
I took him to the church.

03:32.746 --> 03:33.881
I-I thought it might help

03:33.914 --> 03:35.849
if Father Hendry
prayed over him.

03:35.883 --> 03:37.518
What time was it?

03:38.552 --> 03:40.688
11:15, 11:30.

03:40.721 --> 03:43.324
And you were okay with this,
Mrs. Dufoy?

03:43.357 --> 03:46.727
Well, um... we're-we're
Jamie's foster parents.

03:46.760 --> 03:49.563
His birth mother
wanted church to be
part of his life,

03:49.597 --> 03:53.033
so... we-we try
to respect that.

03:53.066 --> 03:54.635
So, what went on last night?

03:54.668 --> 03:56.404
We were praying
with Father Hendry,

03:56.437 --> 03:59.740
and this lady
was holding Jamie's hand,

03:59.773 --> 04:04.878
and... suddenly,
she couldn't find a pulse.

04:04.912 --> 04:08.716
Jamie stopped breathing.

04:08.749 --> 04:12.586
We tried to wake him,
but we couldn't...

04:12.620 --> 04:15.356
May I please see
both of your right hands?

04:16.390 --> 04:17.691
Why?

04:18.726 --> 04:19.993
Please.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.399
Thank you.

04:25.433 --> 04:26.767
Where's the church?

04:26.800 --> 04:28.068
Um, 126th,

04:28.101 --> 04:29.903
off Lennox.

04:29.937 --> 04:31.305
Okay.

04:31.339 --> 04:33.407
If you think of anything else,

04:33.441 --> 04:36.810
please call us, okay?

04:40.814 --> 04:41.915
God, it's 4:45.

04:41.949 --> 04:43.784
I've got to be in
court in five hours.

04:43.817 --> 04:45.085
Okay, you go ahead.

04:45.118 --> 04:47.621
About time Munch got
his bony ass out of bed

04:47.655 --> 04:49.457
for some religion.

04:49.490 --> 04:51.492
Thanks.

04:53.827 --> 04:56.797
Jamie and his father
found comfort

04:56.830 --> 04:59.467
and healing here
on many occasions.

04:59.500 --> 05:01.101
Ask my brothers
and sisters.

05:01.134 --> 05:03.804
Why'd Jamie need healing?
He had demons.

05:03.837 --> 05:06.340
He'd have fits:

05:06.374 --> 05:07.875
hurl himself to the ground,

05:07.908 --> 05:08.842
froth at the mouth,

05:08.876 --> 05:10.778
shout, swear,

05:10.811 --> 05:11.779
bang his head.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.947
And this was
the devil's work?

05:13.981 --> 05:16.083
Medicine couldn't heal Jamie.
Our prayers could.

05:16.116 --> 05:16.884
Then why is he dead?

05:16.917 --> 05:19.753
Excuse me, ma'am,
and you are...?

05:19.787 --> 05:23.791
Mariel Plummer, ACS;
Jamie's case worker.

05:23.824 --> 05:24.925
I just came
from the hospital.

05:24.958 --> 05:26.794
I spoke to Lori-Ann
and Sam.

05:26.827 --> 05:29.763
I just can't believe
this has happened.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.865
Jamie's in a
better place now.
The only better place

05:31.899 --> 05:34.768
Jamie could be is at home
with his parents!

05:34.802 --> 05:38.906
I'm... sorry.
This is just really upsetting.

05:38.939 --> 05:40.808
Ms. Plummer,
in your professional opinion,

05:40.841 --> 05:43.076
was Jamie possessed
by the devil?

05:43.110 --> 05:47.114
Jamie had ADHD with conduct
disorder and epilepsy.

05:47.147 --> 05:51.685
You don't believe me,
speak to his doctor.

05:51.719 --> 05:53.654
DOCTOR:
I worked with Jamie
for nearly a year.

05:53.687 --> 05:55.122
He could be a
real handful.

05:55.155 --> 05:56.957
When a child has
both a behavioral

05:56.990 --> 05:59.527
and an organic
disorder,

05:59.560 --> 06:01.995
one exacerbates
the other.
What did you do for Jamie?

06:02.029 --> 06:03.564
Gave him medication
for epilepsy

06:03.597 --> 06:04.798
and therapy for the ADHD.

06:04.832 --> 06:06.066
He was steadily improving.

06:06.099 --> 06:08.502
He could be
a sweet kid:

06:08.536 --> 06:10.771
funny, loving,
inventive...

06:10.804 --> 06:12.840
I can't believe he's dead.

06:12.873 --> 06:14.875
Isn't that Mariel Plummer?

06:14.908 --> 06:16.143
DOCTOR:
Yes. Jamie's
case worker.

06:16.176 --> 06:17.811
She's great with kids.

06:17.845 --> 06:20.848
He was quite
fond of her.

06:20.881 --> 06:22.650
I felt we had
the behavioral problems

06:22.683 --> 06:24.518
under control,
but there was always a chance

06:24.552 --> 06:25.819
that he could have
another seizure.

06:25.853 --> 06:27.521
FIN:
Could he die
from that?

06:27.555 --> 06:28.989
There is a rare syndrome

06:29.022 --> 06:31.492
called Sudden Unexpected Death
in Epilepsy.

06:31.525 --> 06:33.827
How does that happen?

06:33.861 --> 06:35.896
Not taking one's meds
or mixing them.

06:35.929 --> 06:38.198
Do Jamie's foster parents
know how to medicate him?

06:38.231 --> 06:40.534
Yes, and how to care for him
during a seizure...

06:40.568 --> 06:41.869
but in the last few months,

06:41.902 --> 06:44.705
they'd started looking
for answers elsewhere.

06:44.738 --> 06:47.107
Like at the Church
of Divine Blessing.
Yeah.

06:47.140 --> 06:51.178
Sam Dufoy insisted
that it was good for Jamie.

06:51.211 --> 06:55.716
A month ago, I told them either
leave the church or leave me,

06:55.749 --> 06:57.851
because I couldn't take
responsibility

06:57.885 --> 06:59.720
for Jamie's health.

06:59.753 --> 07:03.657
They chose the church.

07:03.691 --> 07:05.158
According to Doc Engels,
cause of death

07:05.192 --> 07:06.694
could be an epileptic seizure.

07:06.727 --> 07:07.928
You ask me,
that kid is dead

07:07.961 --> 07:09.863
because his parents
didn't give him his meds,

07:09.897 --> 07:11.699
and then dragged him off
to a faith healer.

07:11.732 --> 07:12.766
That's the lure
of faith healing.

07:12.800 --> 07:14.968
Medicine doesn't give them
the answer they want,

07:15.002 --> 07:16.203
so they turn to God.

07:16.236 --> 07:18.205
Doc said Jamie
was getting better.

07:18.238 --> 07:21.041
He's got epilepsy--
he'll always be epileptic.

07:21.074 --> 07:23.210
Medicine can only
treat the condition.

07:23.243 --> 07:25.212
Father Hendry can
promise them a cure.

07:25.245 --> 07:26.580
But he can't deliver.

07:26.614 --> 07:28.582
Then he says
it's the Lord's will.

07:28.616 --> 07:31.218
Yeah, or maybe Sam and
Lori-Ann didn't pray
hard enough.

07:31.251 --> 07:34.054
I got the feeling that Lori-Ann
didn't approve of it.

07:34.087 --> 07:35.889
She doesn't belong
to that church.

07:35.923 --> 07:37.224
Even if Jamie was having
a seizure,

07:37.257 --> 07:39.026
and his dad took him
for a prayer session,

07:39.059 --> 07:41.028
it doesn't account for
the mark on Jamie's chest.

07:41.061 --> 07:43.063
Depends on what kind
of prayer session
you're talking about.

07:43.096 --> 07:45.766
That autistic kid
who died in the
Milwaukee church--

07:45.799 --> 07:47.601
the parishioners
held him down.

07:47.635 --> 07:49.236
They were laying on
top of him to cure him.

07:49.269 --> 07:51.772
That would explain
the ring mark.

07:51.805 --> 07:53.907
Right? Somebody holds
onto Jamie, he struggles,

07:53.941 --> 07:55.242
and they hold
onto him tighter.

07:55.275 --> 07:56.944
Until he stops breathing.

07:56.977 --> 07:58.612
Thank you. I enjoyed that.

07:58.646 --> 08:00.681
Now, have we tracked down
his birth mother yet?

08:00.714 --> 08:01.682
MUNCH:
Social worker says

08:01.715 --> 08:02.816
she moved to Long Island.

08:02.850 --> 08:04.518
I made a call.
The phone's disconnected.

08:04.552 --> 08:06.554
I also did a little homework
on Father Hendry.

08:06.587 --> 08:08.756
He used to be minister
of the Sacred Spirit Church,

08:08.789 --> 08:11.258
but left over
"religious
differences."

08:11.291 --> 08:15.228
Okay. Liv, Elliot,
you got trial prep.

08:15.262 --> 08:17.197
John, Fin, pay a visit

08:17.230 --> 08:19.099
to Sacred Spirit Church--
let's see how

08:19.132 --> 08:21.669
"different"
Father Hendry's religion was.

08:23.270 --> 08:24.972
Lucas Hendry was with us
for many years.

08:25.005 --> 08:26.540
He was a popular preacher.

08:26.574 --> 08:27.575
Why'd he leave?

08:27.608 --> 08:30.778
He was drawn to a more
charismatic form of worship.

08:30.811 --> 08:33.747
He felt people needed
more drama in their faith.

08:33.781 --> 08:34.982
Have you heard of
the Toronto Blessing?

08:35.015 --> 08:36.116
Nope.

08:36.149 --> 08:37.284
It started in the '90s,

08:37.317 --> 08:38.986
in a church near
Toronto Airport.

08:39.019 --> 08:40.320
Practitioners claimed

08:40.353 --> 08:43.023
they could cast out demons,
heal the sick,

08:43.056 --> 08:44.124
speak in tongues.

08:44.157 --> 08:47.561
Hendry and some of our members
were seduced by it.

08:47.595 --> 08:49.029
Like Sam and
Lori-Ann Dufoy?

08:49.062 --> 08:50.664
Sam was.
He and Lori-Ann

08:50.698 --> 08:52.600
are good people.
We were sorry to see them go.

08:52.633 --> 08:53.901
FIN:
You think
Father Hendry's

08:53.934 --> 08:54.768
a fraud?

08:54.802 --> 08:57.304
He doesn't hold rattlesnakes
in one hand

08:57.337 --> 08:58.839
and the collection box
in the other,

08:58.872 --> 09:00.007
if that's what you mean.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.109
He may be deluded,
but he's sincere.

09:04.645 --> 09:06.213
Does Reverend Hendry
always wear this ring?

09:06.246 --> 09:08.782
Yes. It was
his grandfather's.

09:10.150 --> 09:12.052
This mark
was on Jamie's body.

09:12.085 --> 09:14.121
See the partial initials:
J.O.?

09:14.154 --> 09:17.124
Well, my initials are L.H.

09:17.157 --> 09:18.025
FIN:
But it's your ring.

09:18.058 --> 09:19.827
The initials belong
to your grandaddy,

09:19.860 --> 09:20.994
Jackson Ormond.

09:21.028 --> 09:22.630
MUNCH:
Where's the
ring, Father?

09:22.663 --> 09:24.031
I don't wear it anymore.

09:24.064 --> 09:25.265
We talked to the people
that prayed for

09:25.298 --> 09:27.868
Jamie that night-- they said
you were calling to the Lord,

09:27.901 --> 09:28.902
battling with Satan.

09:28.936 --> 09:31.672
His demons were powerful.
I had to fight them.

09:31.705 --> 09:32.973
You held him
so tight

09:33.006 --> 09:35.008
that the ring left
an impression on his flesh.

09:35.042 --> 09:36.677
I was healing him!

09:36.710 --> 09:38.111
You crushed the life
out of him!
No!

09:38.145 --> 09:39.647
You killed him!

09:45.919 --> 09:48.756
God forgive me.

09:48.789 --> 09:51.992
I was only trying to help
the boy.

09:53.060 --> 09:56.830
I-I-I must've held him
too tight.

09:56.864 --> 10:00.100
I... I saw the mark
my ring had made--

10:00.133 --> 10:02.335
I took it off.

10:02.369 --> 10:04.772
I'm so sorry.

10:07.875 --> 10:09.142
About to take him

10:09.176 --> 10:11.344
to Booking.
Put him in the cage.

10:11.378 --> 10:14.014
I think you better
talk to Warner first.

10:20.120 --> 10:22.222
WARNER:
We've got microscopic
cotton fibers.

10:22.255 --> 10:24.191
I found them
in Jamie's lungs and stomach.

10:24.224 --> 10:25.893
Along with these--

10:25.926 --> 10:28.996
traces of toluene
diisocyanate polyol

10:29.029 --> 10:31.331
and pentabromodiphenyl oxide.

10:31.364 --> 10:34.367
Your basic foam rubber
and fire retardant.

10:34.401 --> 10:36.704
So he was smothered
with a cushion?

10:36.737 --> 10:37.705
Or a cheap pillow.

10:37.738 --> 10:40.107
Okay, somebody holds
a pillow over Jamie's face.

10:40.140 --> 10:42.375
The kid fights and bites
right through the case

10:42.409 --> 10:43.343
into the foam.

10:43.376 --> 10:45.779
Yeah, but the parishioners
didn't say anything

10:45.813 --> 10:46.880
about a pillow.

10:46.914 --> 10:48.749
That's because Jamie wasn't
smothered at the church.

10:48.782 --> 10:49.683
How do you know that?

10:49.717 --> 10:53.787
See how clear and deep
the impression is?

10:53.821 --> 10:55.455
That wouldn't have happened
with living skin.

10:55.488 --> 10:58.358
His flesh had started
to swell and become waxy.

10:58.391 --> 11:00.994
Jamie was already dead.

11:01.028 --> 11:04.164
At least an hour
before this mark was made.

11:08.902 --> 11:09.937
You know, I don't know
what you think

11:09.970 --> 11:10.938
you're going to find here.

11:10.971 --> 11:12.005
MUNCH:
We'll let you know

11:12.039 --> 11:13.106
as soon as we find it.

11:13.140 --> 11:14.441
Pillowcase is clean,
no tears.

11:14.474 --> 11:16.243
When's your husband
coming back?

11:16.276 --> 11:17.244
Soon.

11:17.277 --> 11:20.013
He's out making
Jamie's funeral arrangements.

11:20.047 --> 11:21.148
Look like teeth marks.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.483
Mm-hmm. Check this out.

11:23.516 --> 11:25.152
Blood?

11:25.185 --> 11:26.286
LORI-ANN:
No, it couldn't be.

11:26.319 --> 11:29.923
Jamie must've spilled
his chocolate milk or something.

11:29.957 --> 11:32.492
Look, do you really think
we would hurt him?

11:32.525 --> 11:33.827
He was like
our own son.

11:33.861 --> 11:35.162
We need to get this
to the lab.

11:35.195 --> 11:36.329
See if they can ID it.

11:37.765 --> 11:40.233
Pillowcase.
Found it in the trash.

11:40.267 --> 11:42.035
Tear marks.

11:42.069 --> 11:45.005
Check it against
the bite marks on that.

11:51.111 --> 11:52.846
What's going on?

11:54.247 --> 11:56.416
Perfect match.

11:56.449 --> 11:59.319
We just found
your murder weapon.

12:09.429 --> 12:11.064
Jamie was sleeping
when I took him to the church.

12:11.098 --> 12:13.233
He was already dead
when he got there, Sam.

12:13.266 --> 12:14.534
No, no. After one of his fits,

12:14.567 --> 12:17.137
it's like he's in a coma,
but he always wakes up.

12:17.170 --> 12:17.971
He couldn't wake up.

12:18.005 --> 12:22.776
He'd been suffocated
with a pillow.

12:22.810 --> 12:25.012
That's impossible.

12:25.045 --> 12:26.279
I'd never hurt Jamie.

12:26.313 --> 12:28.315
Then why are there bite marks
on his pillow and pillowcase?

12:28.348 --> 12:30.984
Because Jamie is an epileptic.

12:31.018 --> 12:33.086
When he's having a seizure,
he goes crazy.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.322
He'll bite anything
within reach.

12:35.355 --> 12:36.556
MUNCH:
That doesn't explain

12:36.589 --> 12:39.259
the fragments
of foam and fiber
in his lungs.

12:39.292 --> 12:41.061
I don't believe you.

12:41.094 --> 12:42.395
FIN:
What do you think
these are?

12:42.429 --> 12:45.298
That pillow
was pressed so hard
against Jamie's face

12:45.332 --> 12:47.234
he inhaled this stuff.

12:47.901 --> 12:49.369
No!

12:49.402 --> 12:51.338
Come on, Sam.
The kid was running wild,

12:51.371 --> 12:53.373
you were at the end
of your rope.

12:53.406 --> 12:54.341
You put that pillow
over his face,

12:54.374 --> 12:56.243
and you held it there
till he stopped moving.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.244
Stop!

12:57.277 --> 12:59.546
( sobbing )

12:59.579 --> 13:01.982
I loved Jamie.

13:02.015 --> 13:02.983
No, you killed him.

13:03.016 --> 13:05.418
Then you took him
to the church to cover it up.

13:05.452 --> 13:06.553
No. I know my husband.

13:06.586 --> 13:08.455
He would never do anything
like this.

13:08.488 --> 13:09.823
We dumped your phone.

13:09.857 --> 13:11.591
Sam called you at your store
at 11:00. Why?

13:11.624 --> 13:13.593
He said Jamie
was out of control.

13:13.626 --> 13:14.594
Did you go home?

13:14.627 --> 13:15.595
I couldn't.

13:15.628 --> 13:16.596
I had customers.

13:16.629 --> 13:18.198
I told Sam to stay calm.

13:18.231 --> 13:20.300
That I would be there
as soon as I could.

13:20.333 --> 13:21.234
FIN:
Let it out, Sam.

13:21.268 --> 13:24.404
You'll feel better.

13:24.437 --> 13:28.175
( sobbing ):
I just wanted him to sleep.

13:28.208 --> 13:31.511
Just be still for a while.

13:31.544 --> 13:34.247
But then he stopped moving!

13:34.281 --> 13:36.316
So you took him
to the priest.

13:36.349 --> 13:38.618
Father Hendry woke him up
before.

13:38.651 --> 13:40.387
I thought
he could do it again.

13:40.420 --> 13:42.422
Sam, don't say anything else.

13:42.455 --> 13:43.857
We're getting a lawyer.

13:44.457 --> 13:46.493
Baby...

13:46.526 --> 13:49.296
I tried so hard
not to hurt him.

13:49.329 --> 13:50.931
I'm sorry!

13:50.964 --> 13:54.401
Oh, God, I'm sorry!

13:55.068 --> 13:56.269
Father Hendry didn't know

13:56.303 --> 13:57.637
Jamie was already dead?

13:57.670 --> 13:59.072
FIN:
Sam lied.
Told him

13:59.106 --> 14:00.473
the kid had a fit
and was all wrung out.

14:00.507 --> 14:01.441
After a grand mal seizure

14:01.474 --> 14:04.277
epileptics can go
into a semi-comatose state.

14:04.311 --> 14:05.879
It's called
postictal shock.

14:05.913 --> 14:06.880
FIN:
Sam's brought Jamie
to the church

14:06.914 --> 14:07.915
like that before.

14:07.948 --> 14:10.483
Father Hendry thinks
he can wake him up again.

14:10.517 --> 14:12.452
Jamie's birth-mother
just arrived.

14:12.485 --> 14:14.021
This woman is
going to blow.

14:14.054 --> 14:15.455
Anything I can tell her?

14:15.488 --> 14:17.057
Yeah. You caught
her son's killer

14:17.090 --> 14:18.591
and I'm arraigning him
for murder.

14:20.427 --> 14:22.095
Why didn't anybody tell me

14:22.129 --> 14:24.397
what those monsters did
to my son?

14:24.431 --> 14:25.232
We tried calling you.

14:25.265 --> 14:26.433
Then why'd I have
to find out about it

14:26.466 --> 14:28.368
over the television?

14:28.401 --> 14:30.303
My own little son...

14:30.337 --> 14:31.604
Didn't ACS contact you?

14:31.638 --> 14:34.241
How do you think
this all got started?

14:34.274 --> 14:37.410
Who the hell do you think
took Jamie from me

14:37.444 --> 14:39.446
and put him with those freaks?

14:39.479 --> 14:42.315
If you have any information
about the Dufoys,

14:42.349 --> 14:43.917
we'd like to hear it.

14:43.951 --> 14:47.554
He said they hurt him.

14:48.421 --> 14:50.690
He begged me
to let him come home.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.625
Did you report that to ACS?

14:52.659 --> 14:53.726
Yes, I did.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.462
But do you think that bitch
did anything about it?

14:55.495 --> 14:57.364
You mean Mariel Plummer.

14:57.397 --> 14:58.398
Yeah, her.

14:58.431 --> 15:03.971
My son's poor dead
little body is at her door.

15:06.073 --> 15:07.240
She's going to pay for it,

15:07.274 --> 15:10.510
and ACS is
going to pay for it,

15:10.543 --> 15:13.180
the city's going to pay for it.

15:13.213 --> 15:14.481
That's not going

15:14.514 --> 15:15.915
to bring Jamie back.

15:18.451 --> 15:20.653
Have you ever lost a child?

15:21.554 --> 15:22.555
You think

15:22.589 --> 15:26.093
this is about money?!

15:28.061 --> 15:29.362
Unfortunately,

15:29.396 --> 15:30.663
it does seem to be about money.

15:30.697 --> 15:32.399
Tamara Semple's got convictions

15:32.432 --> 15:34.201
for credit card fraud
and shoplifting.

15:34.234 --> 15:36.136
Doesn't take away her right
to be angry.

15:36.169 --> 15:39.039
She loses custody of Jamie
and he ends up dead.

15:39.072 --> 15:42.109
Kid might not have been much
safer with his real mama.

15:42.142 --> 15:43.110
ACS removed Jamie

15:43.143 --> 15:45.712
after his little
sister drowned
in the bathtub.

15:45.745 --> 15:47.047
Where was Tamara?

15:47.080 --> 15:48.448
Talking on the phone.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.417
Courts ruled it was
an accidental death,

15:50.450 --> 15:52.452
but ACS did a
precautionary
removal of Jamie.

15:52.485 --> 15:54.321
This woman's kid dies
in foster care,

15:54.354 --> 15:56.389
the first thing she sees
is a big fat settlement.

15:56.423 --> 15:59.292
What about her allegations
the Dufoys hurt Jamie?

15:59.326 --> 16:00.360
If they did,

16:00.393 --> 16:01.728
ACS could be
found liable,

16:01.761 --> 16:04.597
which would weaken our case
against Sam Dufoy.

16:04.631 --> 16:07.134
We should check it out.

16:09.102 --> 16:11.504
Wouldn't be the first lawsuit

16:11.538 --> 16:14.174
that Tamara Semple brought
against ACS.

16:14.207 --> 16:16.376
Of course,
none of them succeeded.

16:16.409 --> 16:18.011
She told us Jamie complained

16:18.045 --> 16:19.712
the Dufoys
physically abused him.

16:19.746 --> 16:22.149
He never said a word
to me about abuse.

16:22.182 --> 16:24.017
Sam and Lori-Ann
were good parents.

16:24.051 --> 16:26.386
Good parents
don't kill their kids.

16:26.419 --> 16:28.255
You have to understand

16:28.288 --> 16:31.391
how difficult a child
like Jamie could be.

16:31.424 --> 16:32.525
Sam probably snapped.

16:32.559 --> 16:35.495
Did you ever see any evidence
that Sam was unstable?

16:35.528 --> 16:37.130
No. On my home visits,

16:37.164 --> 16:39.099
Jamie was happy, clean,

16:39.132 --> 16:41.234
and very fond of both

16:41.268 --> 16:42.235
Lori-Ann and Sam.

16:42.269 --> 16:43.236
Sam work?

16:43.270 --> 16:44.271
He stays home,

16:44.304 --> 16:45.438
looks after Jamie.

16:45.472 --> 16:47.740
Lori-Ann brought in the money.

16:47.774 --> 16:49.809
Sam and Lori-Ann
were married young.

16:49.842 --> 16:52.312
He was a college
basketball star,

16:52.345 --> 16:55.048
about to be drafted
into the NBA,

16:55.082 --> 16:57.417
when a knee injury
put an end to the dreams.

16:57.450 --> 16:58.618
Excuse me. Tutuola.

16:58.651 --> 17:00.387
Lori-Ann stuck by him.

17:00.420 --> 17:01.221
I make it my business

17:01.254 --> 17:03.390
to know about
my foster families.

17:04.657 --> 17:05.625
This is Jamie's file.

17:05.658 --> 17:06.693
You can take it.

17:06.726 --> 17:07.727
I'm afraid I can't take it

17:07.760 --> 17:09.296
without getting
a subpoena first.

17:09.329 --> 17:12.165
Sure. It's here
when you need it.

17:12.199 --> 17:13.466
Thank you.

17:13.500 --> 17:16.803
Thanks.

17:16.836 --> 17:17.870
Crime lab.

17:17.904 --> 17:20.740
They said they got
something they want
us to hear.

17:21.708 --> 17:22.742
I checked Sam's LUDS.

17:22.775 --> 17:25.312
A half hour before
he called Lori-Ann
at the store,

17:25.345 --> 17:27.380
he also called
the Child Abuse Hotline.

17:27.414 --> 17:29.616
And all the Hotline calls
are recorded.

17:29.649 --> 17:31.151
That's right.

17:31.184 --> 17:32.352
SAM:
Hello? Hello!

17:32.385 --> 17:35.322
WOMAN:
Child Abuse Hotline.
Can I help you?

17:35.355 --> 17:36.223
Yeah, it's my foster kid,

17:36.256 --> 17:38.091
I can't deal with him
anymore. He's...

17:38.125 --> 17:39.126
( loud crash, Jamie yells )

17:39.159 --> 17:40.127
Jamie, cut that out!

17:40.160 --> 17:41.461
You've got to help me here!

17:41.494 --> 17:43.163
Sir, are you reporting
an incident

17:43.196 --> 17:44.164
of child abuse?

17:44.197 --> 17:45.432
No, no, nothing like that.

17:45.465 --> 17:47.434
Is the child in danger
at this moment?

17:47.467 --> 17:49.236
No! He's just
out of control!

17:49.269 --> 17:51.138
Sir, if it's an
emergency, call 911.

17:51.171 --> 17:53.540
Otherwise you should call
your ACS caseworker.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.308
I have called!
She never answers.

17:55.342 --> 17:56.609
I want help, you hear?!

17:56.643 --> 17:58.345
I want him out
of my house!

17:58.378 --> 17:59.512
Sir, I'll take
your information

17:59.546 --> 18:01.348
and pass it to Child
Protective Services.

18:01.381 --> 18:03.783
They'll contact you
within 24 hours.

18:03.816 --> 18:07.320
24 hours? Oh, man!

18:07.354 --> 18:10.323
Had he called his caseworker?

18:10.357 --> 18:12.859
Well, LUDS show four calls
to Mariel Plummer's ACS office

18:12.892 --> 18:13.860
the day Jamie died.

18:13.893 --> 18:15.595
Did she talk to him?

18:15.628 --> 18:16.429
I can't say.

18:16.463 --> 18:17.530
No call was shorter
than 20 seconds,

18:17.564 --> 18:20.633
which means Sam either
had a conversation with her

18:20.667 --> 18:22.135
or left a message.

18:22.169 --> 18:25.438
It's funny how Mariel
didn't tell us any of this.

18:25.472 --> 18:26.906
I'll put a rush on the subpoena.

18:26.939 --> 18:28.808
You get a hold
of all Mariel's case files.

18:28.841 --> 18:30.743
We'll see what else
she forgot to tell us.

18:32.312 --> 18:34.847
Mariel's records seem to show
she was doing her job.

18:34.881 --> 18:36.249
Visited Jamie every month,
but see those dates?

18:36.283 --> 18:37.250
MUNCH:
They're the same.

18:37.284 --> 18:38.285
Yeah.

18:38.318 --> 18:39.886
which means all the records
were wither generated

18:39.919 --> 18:42.255
or altered on the same date;
which happens to be yesterday.

18:42.289 --> 18:43.390
What are you doing?

18:43.423 --> 18:45.658
I gave you everything you need.

18:45.692 --> 18:47.827
We were just admiring
you writing up

18:47.860 --> 18:50.563
six-months worth of records
in only one day.

18:50.597 --> 18:54.601
I was checking them
because of the subpoena.

18:54.634 --> 18:56.803
I didn't alter a thing.

18:56.836 --> 18:57.937
I'm afraid the log date

18:57.970 --> 18:59.839
only changes
if an alteration is made.

18:59.872 --> 19:01.441
I was probably
tidying things up.

19:01.474 --> 19:04.211
It's impossible to keep track
of all the paperwork.

19:04.244 --> 19:05.278
Mariel Plummer,

19:05.312 --> 19:06.045
you are under arrest

19:06.078 --> 19:07.914
for tampering
with public records.

19:07.947 --> 19:10.250
You're arresting me
for paperwork?

19:10.283 --> 19:11.651
And for reckless
endangerment

19:11.684 --> 19:13.286
in the death
of Jamie Semple.

19:13.320 --> 19:14.787
You have the right
to remain silent.

19:14.821 --> 19:15.822
Anything you do say...

19:20.827 --> 19:21.761
You've got
a problem, Counselor.

19:21.794 --> 19:24.264
Arresting Jamie's social
worker makes it harder

19:24.297 --> 19:25.265
to convict Sam Dufoy.

19:25.298 --> 19:26.466
He can claim it
was her fault:

19:26.499 --> 19:28.268
he asked for help
and didn't get it.

19:28.301 --> 19:29.936
And if a jury buys it,
Sam could walk.

19:29.969 --> 19:31.971
What are you going
to do, plead him out?

19:32.004 --> 19:33.206
No way.

19:33.240 --> 19:34.341
He killed that kid.

19:34.374 --> 19:35.642
Question is--
who do I try first?

19:35.675 --> 19:37.810
If I go with Sam and I put
Mariel on the stand,

19:37.844 --> 19:40.247
she can't testify without
incriminating herself.

19:40.280 --> 19:41.814
But I don't want
to give her immunity.

19:41.848 --> 19:43.516
What does your gut tell you?

19:43.550 --> 19:45.318
Get the facts
on the record...

19:45.352 --> 19:48.321
catch the little fish
before I go for the big one.

19:48.355 --> 19:50.590
I'll go schedule
Mariel's court date.

19:55.728 --> 19:56.963
Casey...

19:56.996 --> 19:58.898
Carolyn. What are
you doing here?

19:58.931 --> 20:00.733
Representing
Mariel Plummer.

20:00.767 --> 20:03.936
I trust you've had second
thoughts about persecuting her.

20:03.970 --> 20:05.605
No.

20:05.638 --> 20:07.874
You seriously intend
to clog up the courts,

20:07.907 --> 20:10.510
to try someone on a couple
of clerical errors?

20:10.543 --> 20:11.611
Not errors.

20:11.644 --> 20:14.281
Deliberate falsifications
designed to conceal the fact

20:14.314 --> 20:15.682
she recklessly
endangered a child.

20:15.715 --> 20:16.783
My client was deceived

20:16.816 --> 20:18.551
by a nut case,
who murdered a kid

20:18.585 --> 20:21.321
and then asked a voodoo priest
to bring him back to life.

20:21.354 --> 20:22.389
But let's deal.

20:22.422 --> 20:23.189
A year's probation

20:23.222 --> 20:25.325
for falsifying
the official record--

20:25.358 --> 20:26.593
you drop
all other charges.

20:26.626 --> 20:27.594
No thanks.

20:27.627 --> 20:28.795
She takes a felony plea--

20:28.828 --> 20:30.630
guilty of reckless
endangerment.

20:30.663 --> 20:32.665
Motion to dismiss
the endangerment charge

20:32.699 --> 20:34.534
on constitutional
grounds.

20:34.567 --> 20:36.369
What are you talking about?

20:36.403 --> 20:38.471
You're forgetting your
14th Amendment, Casey.

20:38.505 --> 20:39.439
See you at the hearing.

20:43.075 --> 20:45.645
The Due Process Clause
in the 14th Amendment

20:45.678 --> 20:48.681
does not require a state agency
to protect its citizens

20:48.715 --> 20:49.682
from private violence.

20:49.716 --> 20:52.352
Therefore there's no case
against my client.

20:52.385 --> 20:54.621
That ruling also says
that a state agency

20:54.654 --> 20:55.955
isn't required to protect
its citizens

20:55.988 --> 20:57.524
against violence
and other mishaps

20:57.557 --> 20:58.525
that are, I quote,

20:58.558 --> 20:59.326
"not attributable

20:59.359 --> 21:01.394
to the conducts
of its employees."

21:01.428 --> 21:04.331
Jamie Semple's death is at least
partly attributable

21:04.364 --> 21:05.832
to Mariel Plummer's
negligence.

21:05.865 --> 21:07.634
Ms. Maddox,
your own case law

21:07.667 --> 21:08.668
seems to help Ms. Novak.

21:08.701 --> 21:10.637
She's misreading
what the justices

21:10.670 --> 21:11.638
had in mind.

21:11.671 --> 21:14.507
If a criminal court finds
my client culpable

21:14.541 --> 21:16.609
for Jamie's death,
then who's next?

21:16.643 --> 21:17.944
Police officers who fail

21:17.977 --> 21:19.111
to prevent a homicide?

21:19.145 --> 21:22.649
Firefighters who don't save
someone from being burned?

21:22.682 --> 21:24.016
Your Honor,
that's a reach.

21:24.050 --> 21:25.518
Many courts
have ruled

21:25.552 --> 21:26.919
that a child in foster care
is analogous

21:26.953 --> 21:28.421
to a prisoner in state custody,

21:28.455 --> 21:29.989
and that state officials,
like Ms. Plummer,

21:30.022 --> 21:32.625
are not only liable
for harm the child suffers,

21:32.659 --> 21:33.826
but also
for failing to act

21:33.860 --> 21:36.763
where there is potential
for harm.

21:36.796 --> 21:38.365
I'm sorry, Ms. Maddox,

21:38.398 --> 21:40.933
I agree with Ms. Novak's reading
of the law.

21:40.967 --> 21:43.870
Your client must
stand trial.

21:48.441 --> 21:50.443
When you called
the Child Abuse Hotline

21:50.477 --> 21:51.411
the night Jamie died,

21:51.444 --> 21:53.346
you said you tried to contact

21:53.380 --> 21:54.714
your case worker,
Mariel Plummer.

21:54.747 --> 21:55.715
How many times?

21:55.748 --> 21:57.384
Four times that day.

21:57.417 --> 22:00.387
Another three times
the week before.

22:00.420 --> 22:02.689
Did she ever return
any of those calls?

22:02.722 --> 22:05.091
No.

22:05.124 --> 22:06.626
Why were you calling her?

22:06.659 --> 22:08.561
Because I was
having a hard time

22:08.595 --> 22:09.562
coping with Jamie.

22:09.596 --> 22:11.398
What could Mariel have done?

22:11.431 --> 22:14.567
If she had called back
or visited,

22:14.601 --> 22:17.570
she would have seen that Jamie
was out of control,

22:17.604 --> 22:19.406
and how I was struggling.

22:19.439 --> 22:22.542
Then none of this
would have happened.

22:22.575 --> 22:24.644
Thank you.

22:24.677 --> 22:27.714
Why not call 911?

22:27.747 --> 22:29.849
What do you mean?

22:29.882 --> 22:32.552
You said you were scared you
couldn't cope with Jamie.

22:32.585 --> 22:33.553
Why not call 911

22:33.586 --> 22:36.423
as the operator suggested?

22:36.456 --> 22:38.491
I don't know.

22:38.525 --> 22:40.126
Or take Jamie
to the emergency room,

22:40.159 --> 22:42.995
or call a neighbor,
or do anything?

22:44.697 --> 22:46.566
I thought I could handle him.

22:46.599 --> 22:48.635
How, by smothering him
with a pillow?

22:48.668 --> 22:50.470
Objection!

22:50.503 --> 22:51.504
It goes to credibility,
Your Honor.

22:51.538 --> 22:53.673
The jury has a right to know
that this witness

22:53.706 --> 22:55.942
is facing criminal charges in
the death of his foster son

22:55.975 --> 23:00.480
and therefore has
an excellent motive to lie.

23:00.513 --> 23:01.481
I'll allow it.

23:01.514 --> 23:02.682
The witness will respond.

23:02.715 --> 23:04.617
Did you suffocate Jamie

23:04.651 --> 23:06.419
with a pillow?

23:07.820 --> 23:10.657
I assert my Fifth Amendment
rights

23:10.690 --> 23:13.826
against
self-incrimination.

23:13.860 --> 23:15.962
Nothing further.

23:19.532 --> 23:22.068
How long have you been
a social worker?

23:22.101 --> 23:23.169
About 18 years.

23:23.202 --> 23:24.571
And why did you become one?

23:24.604 --> 23:25.938
I wanted to help people--

23:25.972 --> 23:27.707
make a difference
in a small way.

23:27.740 --> 23:29.509
I'm sure there are
many people

23:29.542 --> 23:32.111
who are very grateful to you.

23:32.144 --> 23:33.580
Frankly,
I doubt that.

23:33.613 --> 23:34.781
I usually show up

23:34.814 --> 23:36.816
when a family is in crisis.

23:36.849 --> 23:39.619
I'm the one who has to say
to the mom,

23:39.652 --> 23:42.121
"Why are your kids'
clothes dirty?

23:42.154 --> 23:44.524
Why did your kids
miss school?"

23:44.557 --> 23:46.726
Worse than that,
I'm the one

23:46.759 --> 23:48.595
that has to remove the kids

23:48.628 --> 23:51.664
if there's any suspicion
of abuse or neglect.

23:51.698 --> 23:53.500
Have you ever been threatened?

23:53.533 --> 23:55.034
Usually just
verbal abuse.

23:55.067 --> 23:56.869
I've been mugged three times,

23:56.903 --> 23:59.205
chased out of apartments
with knives.

23:59.238 --> 24:01.073
I work in pretty rough areas.

24:01.107 --> 24:03.743
And you keep
coming back?

24:03.776 --> 24:06.846
Someone has to look out
for the kids.

24:06.879 --> 24:10.550
Then what went wrong with Jamie?

24:11.751 --> 24:14.186
I made a mistake.

24:14.220 --> 24:18.491
I thought that Lori-Ann and Sam
were good foster parents

24:18.525 --> 24:20.493
and that Jamie was safe.

24:20.527 --> 24:21.894
And you never thought

24:21.928 --> 24:22.962
he was in danger?

24:22.995 --> 24:23.963
No.

24:23.996 --> 24:26.533
And I had what
I thought

24:26.566 --> 24:28.234
were more urgent cases--

24:28.267 --> 24:31.571
and I was giving all my
attention to them.

24:31.604 --> 24:33.172
I was wrong.

24:33.205 --> 24:36.943
I'll never be able
to forgive myself.

24:36.976 --> 24:38.210
Thank you.

24:41.781 --> 24:44.283
You say you didn't think
Jamie was in danger...

24:44.316 --> 24:46.819
but Sam Dufoy had called,
left messages.

24:46.853 --> 24:48.087
Didn't that warn you?

24:48.120 --> 24:51.257
The messages said that
Jamie was acting up

24:51.290 --> 24:53.760
and that Sam wanted to talk.

24:53.793 --> 24:55.662
It didn't sound urgent.

24:55.695 --> 24:57.263
He called four times

24:57.296 --> 24:58.598
the day Jamie died.

24:58.631 --> 25:00.933
How much more urgent can it get?

25:00.967 --> 25:02.802
I thought Jaime was safe.

25:02.835 --> 25:03.970
You had no idea

25:04.003 --> 25:06.539
what was going on
in the Dufoy house.

25:06.573 --> 25:08.074
You'd hadn't
visited in months.

25:08.107 --> 25:09.876
You'd forgotten
all about Jamie.

25:09.909 --> 25:11.177
No, I cared about him.

25:11.210 --> 25:13.980
Then why not return Sam's calls?

25:14.013 --> 25:15.682
Because I was out of the office

25:15.715 --> 25:17.316
till late working
on another case.

25:17.349 --> 25:21.721
But you cared about Jamie.

25:21.754 --> 25:24.991
Why was that other case
so much more important?

25:28.628 --> 25:31.698
A father returned home
from prison.

25:31.731 --> 25:35.267
He beat his wife to death
with a hammer,

25:35.301 --> 25:37.670
then he killed himself
in front of his two children.

25:37.704 --> 25:39.038
That's what I was working on.

25:39.071 --> 25:44.110
That's why I didn't
return Sam's calls.

25:44.143 --> 25:46.278
I made a terrible mistake,

25:46.312 --> 25:49.682
but don't accuse me
of not caring.

25:53.285 --> 25:56.055
No further questions.

26:00.126 --> 26:03.262
A social worker's job--
poorly paid, usually thankless.

26:03.295 --> 26:05.231
They work in the most
deprived

26:05.264 --> 26:07.600
and violent parts
of our cities,

26:07.634 --> 26:11.137
where they can be assaulted,
raped even murdered.

26:11.170 --> 26:13.606
Burnout's common.

26:13.640 --> 26:16.275
Many don't last five years.

26:16.308 --> 26:19.912
Mariel Plummer has worked
for 18.

26:19.946 --> 26:24.784
When Jamie died,
she had nearly 20 cases.

26:24.817 --> 26:29.321
The recommended caseload
is 12.

26:29.355 --> 26:32.625
This tragedy isn't
Mariel's fault,

26:32.659 --> 26:35.061
it's the fault of an
overburdened system:

26:35.094 --> 26:37.764
too few case workers,
too few dollars,

26:37.797 --> 26:41.200
too many children in need.

26:41.233 --> 26:45.004
Out of grief and panic
after Jamie's death,

26:45.037 --> 26:48.174
Mariel altered
her official records.

26:48.207 --> 26:51.911
She admits it,
she is sorry for it.

26:51.944 --> 26:54.246
Find her guilty on that charge,

26:54.280 --> 26:57.850
not on the charge of endangering
Jamie's life.

26:57.884 --> 27:02.789
Jamie slipped through
a crack in the system.

27:02.822 --> 27:05.892
Blame the system,

27:05.925 --> 27:08.895
blame the man who killed Jamie,

27:08.928 --> 27:13.933
but don't blame
the social worker.

27:19.772 --> 27:22.909
Mariel Plummer was the crack
in the system.

27:22.942 --> 27:28.981
She was the one person whose job
it was to look out for Jamie,

27:29.015 --> 27:31.818
and she failed to do her job.

27:31.851 --> 27:33.920
If she'd made any one
of the visits

27:33.953 --> 27:35.788
she fraudulently claimed

27:35.822 --> 27:39.726
to have made, or returned any
one of the phone calls,

27:39.759 --> 27:40.993
Jamie would be alive.

27:41.027 --> 27:45.031
She turned her back on him.

27:45.064 --> 27:47.166
That is child endangerment.

27:47.199 --> 27:51.170
This time you must blame
the social worker.

27:51.203 --> 27:54.340
Find Mariel guilty and send
a message to her,

27:54.373 --> 27:57.009
to her supervisors
and to the city

27:57.043 --> 27:58.410
and to the state,

27:58.444 --> 28:04.016
that the death of even one child
is unacceptable.

28:10.389 --> 28:11.924
Verdict in already?

28:11.958 --> 28:13.159
Guilty
on the record tampering,

28:13.192 --> 28:14.894
not guilty on
child endangerment.

28:14.927 --> 28:15.995
Why not?

28:16.028 --> 28:17.930
Maddox played the jury
like a violin.

28:17.964 --> 28:19.932
Mariel was under intolerable
pressure,

28:19.966 --> 28:21.768
she made an understandable
mistake.

28:21.801 --> 28:22.969
They bought it.

28:23.002 --> 28:24.436
At least when
you try Sam Dufoy,

28:24.470 --> 28:26.205
he won't be able
to blame Mariel.

28:26.238 --> 28:27.406
Unless I blow that trial, too.

28:27.439 --> 28:30.309
Someone's got to be accountable
for that poor kid's death.

28:30.342 --> 28:31.343
I may have something.

28:31.377 --> 28:33.780
Clear evidence of abuse
from the Dufoy apartment.

28:33.813 --> 28:35.982
Why'd it take so long?

28:36.015 --> 28:39.118
Sample had to work its way from
Criminalistics to Serology.

28:39.151 --> 28:41.020
Remember the stain
on Jamie's bed?

28:41.053 --> 28:41.988
It's blood.

28:42.021 --> 28:44.223
Lab finally ID'd the object
that made it:

28:44.256 --> 28:45.291
a cheese grater.

28:45.324 --> 28:48.227
Serology found skin cells
and cheese fragments.

28:48.260 --> 28:51.798
Someone dragged a cheese grater
across the kid's skin?

28:51.831 --> 28:53.332
How old is the blood stain?

28:53.365 --> 28:54.466
At most a few days.

28:54.500 --> 28:57.469
Otherwise the blood would
have oxidized completely.

28:57.503 --> 28:59.872
FIN:
But Jamie didn't have

28:59.906 --> 29:00.706
any other marks on him.

29:00.739 --> 29:02.208
That's because it wasn't
Jamie's blood.

29:02.241 --> 29:04.310
It's from a female.

29:04.343 --> 29:05.311
Mom?

29:05.344 --> 29:07.146
Wrong blood group.

29:07.179 --> 29:09.816
And from the low levels
of the hormones

29:09.849 --> 29:11.383
FSH and LH in her blood,

29:11.417 --> 29:13.920
this female is in early puberty.

29:13.953 --> 29:16.488
The Dufoys had a girl
in that apartment?

29:16.522 --> 29:18.457
Then where the hell is she?

29:18.490 --> 29:19.458
Go talk to Mariel.

29:19.491 --> 29:22.962
See if she made another
understandable mistake.

29:30.036 --> 29:31.037
What do you want?

29:31.070 --> 29:33.105
Aren't you done
harassing me?

29:33.139 --> 29:36.308
Don't kid yourself, lady,
you got off light.

29:36.342 --> 29:38.177
I lost my job, my pension,

29:38.210 --> 29:40.546
I've been crucified
by the press.

29:40.579 --> 29:42.581
I get threatening
phone calls...

29:42.614 --> 29:45.151
I don't have time for
your self-pity.

29:45.184 --> 29:48.054
Where's the other foster kid
that was staying

29:48.087 --> 29:49.188
in the Dufoys' apartment?

29:49.221 --> 29:50.923
What are you talking about?

29:50.957 --> 29:52.291
Jamie was their only child.

29:52.324 --> 29:53.425
You saw my records.

29:53.459 --> 29:55.127
Your records don't mean
a damn thing.

29:55.161 --> 29:57.229
Forensics says there was
another girl there.

29:57.263 --> 29:58.597
What forensics?

29:58.630 --> 30:00.166
The girl's blood.

30:00.199 --> 30:03.936
Sam Dufoy sliced her up
with a cheese grater.

30:05.537 --> 30:09.909
Oh, my God, I... I had no idea.

30:09.942 --> 30:13.880
Why didn't I go
to the apartment?

30:13.913 --> 30:15.147
I'm so sorry.

30:15.181 --> 30:16.615
( phone ringing )

30:16.648 --> 30:18.150
Yeah, I bet you are.

30:18.184 --> 30:21.587
Just tell me where she is
and how I can find her.

30:21.620 --> 30:22.989
I don't know...

30:23.022 --> 30:23.990
Hello.

30:24.023 --> 30:26.092
Just leave me alone!

30:26.125 --> 30:28.227
Give me this.

30:28.260 --> 30:30.229
Yeah, who the hell
you calling a bitch?

30:30.262 --> 30:31.363
This is the police.

30:31.397 --> 30:33.966
Ring this number again
we're going to come

30:34.000 --> 30:35.267
busting in your damn door.

30:35.301 --> 30:37.636
Believe that.

30:37.669 --> 30:39.872
Mariel...

30:39.906 --> 30:41.540
Okay, okay, okay.

30:41.573 --> 30:44.343
Put the gun down.
Come on.

30:44.376 --> 30:47.914
Please put down the gun.

30:47.947 --> 30:50.316
I saved thousands of children
and I'll only be remembered

30:50.349 --> 30:52.118
for one.

30:52.151 --> 30:53.920
No...
( gunshot )

31:01.160 --> 31:03.162
( gasping )

31:03.195 --> 31:05.164
You didn't have to do this.

31:12.671 --> 31:16.108
Single shot to the
chest, point blank.

31:16.142 --> 31:18.310
This should be a
quick job for you.

31:18.344 --> 31:19.345
WARNER:
Thanks.

31:19.378 --> 31:21.413
Are you okay?

31:21.447 --> 31:23.249
I'm cool.

31:23.282 --> 31:25.117
I know.

31:25.151 --> 31:27.586
But are you okay?

31:27.619 --> 31:29.388
Yeah.

31:33.492 --> 31:35.694
You come to shrink me, too?
Nope. You need me,
you'll holler.

31:35.727 --> 31:36.695
Yeah, I do.

31:36.728 --> 31:40.066
Would you get over to ACS,
see what you can find

31:40.099 --> 31:43.302
on a foster kid-- a girl--
staying with the Dufoys.

31:43.335 --> 31:44.937
Mariel Plummer didn't
know who she was?

31:44.971 --> 31:46.939
If she had have checked
on Jamie, she would've,

31:46.973 --> 31:50.009
but, uh, I told her
about the blood stain.

31:50.042 --> 31:51.910
That's when
she shot herself.

31:53.212 --> 31:54.480
Where you going?

31:54.513 --> 31:57.183
I'm going to go
get cleaned up.

31:57.216 --> 31:59.618
Then I'm going to pay
Sam Dufoy a visit.

32:04.390 --> 32:06.558
SAM:
I don't know
what you're talking about.

32:06.592 --> 32:08.961
FIN:
People who say that
usually mean they do.

32:08.995 --> 32:11.330
There was no girl
living with us.
!
You're a liar.

32:11.363 --> 32:12.698
You cut her
and left her blood

32:12.731 --> 32:14.700
and skin on the bed--
what's her name?

32:14.733 --> 32:16.568
He told you:
he doesn't know.

32:16.602 --> 32:18.170
FIN:
You kill her too?

32:18.204 --> 32:19.605
Like you killed Jamie?

32:19.638 --> 32:22.975
Guard, we're through here.

32:23.609 --> 32:25.377
Is she alive?

32:25.411 --> 32:27.046
What did you do with her?

32:27.079 --> 32:28.447
Where the hell is she?

32:32.618 --> 32:33.619
That bastard
didn't give me a thing.

32:33.652 --> 32:34.753
What about Lori-Ann?

32:34.786 --> 32:36.622
She'll just come out with
that "Sam's a good man" crap.

32:36.655 --> 32:37.656
You got anything?

32:37.689 --> 32:39.125
Yep. ACS have no record

32:39.158 --> 32:41.593
of any other kids
placed with Sam Dufoy.

32:41.627 --> 32:44.563
So I got them to check under
Lori-Ann's maiden name.

32:44.596 --> 32:47.299
Four kids were placed
with Lori-Ann Watkins
in the last two years--

32:47.333 --> 32:49.535
all from Freshfields
private foster home.

32:49.568 --> 32:51.103
Is one of them our girl?

32:51.137 --> 32:53.405
Last kid was placed with
Lori-Ann six months ago,

32:53.439 --> 32:55.207
but ran away a
couple weeks later.

32:55.241 --> 32:56.208
Her name is Megan Rose.

32:56.242 --> 32:56.975
CRAGEN:
Why the hell did ACS

32:57.009 --> 32:59.278
only hear about this now?
ACS says

32:59.311 --> 33:01.680
they never got the report
Megan was missing.

33:01.713 --> 33:03.515
Freshfields insists
they sent it.

33:03.549 --> 33:05.084
While they're playing pass
the buck, Megan could be dead.

33:05.117 --> 33:07.153
John, find out why
this foster agency

33:07.186 --> 33:08.520
went on sending
kids to a woman

33:08.554 --> 33:10.256
who kept on
losing them-- Fin!

33:10.289 --> 33:11.690
I'm hauling her ass in.

33:13.659 --> 33:15.194
Yeah, of course
I know Megan.

33:15.227 --> 33:17.263
She ran away a week after
being placed with us.

33:17.296 --> 33:18.797
I'm afraid she
was incorrigible.

33:18.830 --> 33:20.399
And that just
slipped your mind.

33:20.432 --> 33:22.068
It was six months ago.

33:22.101 --> 33:24.136
I'm sorry, it didn't
seem relevant.

33:24.170 --> 33:29.508
What about Stacey Dean,
Isiah Simpson, Nyal Iwa?

33:29.541 --> 33:30.576
They incorrigible too?

33:30.609 --> 33:31.777
Yes.

33:31.810 --> 33:34.213
They've been in the foster care
system their entire lives.

33:34.246 --> 33:36.615
Sam is a great dad, and even
he couldn't cope with them.

33:36.648 --> 33:38.750
He "take care of them"
the same way he did Jamie?

33:38.784 --> 33:40.586
They ran away.

33:40.619 --> 33:42.221
We tried to help these kids,

33:42.254 --> 33:43.522
but they didn't
want to be helped.

33:43.555 --> 33:45.357
And I resent your accusations,
Detective.

33:45.391 --> 33:48.527
We're not through, lady.
Sit back down.

33:50.429 --> 33:52.464
When these kids went missing,
what did you do?

33:52.498 --> 33:55.067
I informed the
foster care agency.

33:55.101 --> 33:56.202
And they informed ACS?

33:56.235 --> 33:58.204
Right. They gave
the file back.

33:58.237 --> 34:00.239
MUNCH:
Then why doesn't ACS
have the files,

34:00.272 --> 34:01.173
and why are you
still getting paid?

34:01.207 --> 34:03.275
Your bank records show
you're still receiving

34:03.309 --> 34:04.643
Adoption Assistance Payments

34:04.676 --> 34:06.745
for every one
of those kids.

34:06.778 --> 34:08.280
It was a computer error.

34:08.314 --> 34:11.217
Four computer errors,
a little more than two years:

34:11.250 --> 34:12.518
you get two grand a month

34:12.551 --> 34:14.753
for kids that haven't been
in your home in months.

34:14.786 --> 34:16.588
I'm telling you,
it's a mistake.

34:16.622 --> 34:18.124
FIN:
You took in runaways,

34:18.157 --> 34:20.492
treat 'em like crap,
so they'd run away again.

34:20.526 --> 34:21.427
Or did Sam
just kill them?

34:21.460 --> 34:25.231
No! Nobody else
would touch these kids.

34:25.264 --> 34:27.199
Well, somebody touched Megan
Rose with a cheese grater.

34:27.233 --> 34:30.136
What are you talking about?

34:31.203 --> 34:33.172
This is Megan Rose's blood,
and it damn sure

34:33.205 --> 34:34.673
ain't six months old.

34:34.706 --> 34:36.642
She was in your home
the week Jamie died.

34:36.675 --> 34:38.110
Did she see Sam kill him?

34:38.144 --> 34:39.378
I swear,
Megan was gone.

34:39.411 --> 34:41.647
Or maybe she came back,
I don't know!

34:41.680 --> 34:44.116
I work so many hours
at the store...

34:44.150 --> 34:46.352
If she came back,
where is she now?

34:49.655 --> 34:52.391
You're trying to get me
to hurt Sam, but I won't.

34:52.424 --> 34:53.492
Just tell us where Megan is!

34:53.525 --> 34:55.361
I said I don't know!

34:57.696 --> 34:59.598
FIN:
That's Megan.
Remember her now?

35:01.367 --> 35:02.268
She was in your home, Sam,

35:02.301 --> 35:04.703
maybe for a night,
maybe for just an hour

35:04.736 --> 35:06.338
but her blood says
she was there.

35:06.372 --> 35:09.241
Did you kill her, Sam?

35:09.275 --> 35:11.310
Come on! You're already
going down for murder,

35:11.343 --> 35:12.211
what have you got to lose?

35:12.244 --> 35:14.213
Tell me what happened!

35:14.246 --> 35:17.149
What are you hiding, Sam?

35:17.183 --> 35:18.217
Are you trying to protect her?

35:18.250 --> 35:19.485
Did she kill Jamie?

35:19.518 --> 35:21.253
No!

35:21.287 --> 35:24.223
Then help me find her.
She's just a kid.

35:28.227 --> 35:29.828
St. Columba's.

35:29.861 --> 35:32.231
The psych home?

35:33.665 --> 35:34.833
She went crazy.

35:38.237 --> 35:41.773
WOMAN:
Megan was brought here
three weeks ago.

35:41.807 --> 35:43.909
She was kicking and
screaming at the staff,

35:43.942 --> 35:45.511
raving about
murdered children.

35:45.544 --> 35:46.578
What did you
do with her?

35:46.612 --> 35:48.647
Diagnosed her as
acutely psychotic

35:48.680 --> 35:50.316
with paranoid features.

35:50.349 --> 35:51.883
We sedated her with Haldol,

35:51.917 --> 35:53.919
waited for the
psychosis to break.

35:53.952 --> 35:56.755
Unfortunately, as soon as
the medication wore off,

35:56.788 --> 36:00.392
the delusions returned and
we had to sedate her again.

36:00.426 --> 36:01.560
How's she doing?

36:01.593 --> 36:04.330
Quieter. We've
reduced the dosage.

36:04.363 --> 36:06.232
But her foster agency
doesn't want her back,

36:06.265 --> 36:07.499
and I doubt
anyone else will,

36:07.533 --> 36:08.667
so it looks like

36:08.700 --> 36:10.302
she's set for
a long stay.

36:10.336 --> 36:12.804
Any chance
she was telling the truth?

36:12.838 --> 36:14.340
No, she had clearly
decompensated.

36:14.373 --> 36:16.575
The foster parent
who brought her in told us

36:16.608 --> 36:18.310
she would mutilate herself

36:18.344 --> 36:20.246
and that these
psychotic episodes

36:20.279 --> 36:21.680
had become
increasingly frequent.

36:21.713 --> 36:24.350
The foster parent--
her name Lori-Ann?

36:24.383 --> 36:25.984
Yeah.

36:26.017 --> 36:27.386
You should've
listened to Megan.

36:27.419 --> 36:28.920
She was brought in here
the night

36:28.954 --> 36:31.723
her six-year-old foster brother
was murdered.

36:37.463 --> 36:39.998
Megan...

36:40.031 --> 36:42.268
My name is Fin.
I'm a cop.

36:42.301 --> 36:44.236
I want to talk to
you about Jamie.

36:44.270 --> 36:46.338
Get away from me.

36:46.372 --> 36:48.274
We know he's dead, Megan.

36:48.307 --> 36:50.242
Megan, get back into bed.
You stay out of this.

36:50.276 --> 36:51.943
Get away from me!
You leave me alone!

36:51.977 --> 36:53.512
I'm not going to hurt you.
Yes, you are.

36:53.545 --> 36:54.746
You're trying to trick me!

36:54.780 --> 36:56.282
You're gonna stick me
with needles!

36:56.315 --> 36:57.283
No, I'm not.

36:57.316 --> 36:59.351
I know you're
telling the truth.

36:59.385 --> 37:01.887
I know who
cut your face.

37:01.920 --> 37:03.855
She said I was crazy.

37:03.889 --> 37:04.990
You're not crazy.

37:05.023 --> 37:06.692
You saw
what happened to Jamie.

37:06.725 --> 37:08.960
( sobbing )

37:15.634 --> 37:17.969
Tell me.

37:18.003 --> 37:22.308
That night,
were you in Jamie's room?

37:22.341 --> 37:24.376
Yes.

37:24.410 --> 37:26.378
Was Sam?

37:26.412 --> 37:28.447
No.

37:28.480 --> 37:30.816
Who was it?

37:30.849 --> 37:33.885
I can't. I can't.

37:33.919 --> 37:35.987
I promise no one will hurt you.

37:37.723 --> 37:39.791
Who was it?

37:43.429 --> 37:46.498
Lori-Ann.

37:47.666 --> 37:49.535
Tell me what happened, baby.

37:52.738 --> 37:58.344
Jamie was crying and crying,
and then he just stopped.

37:58.377 --> 38:01.513
So I went in his room
and I saw her.

38:01.547 --> 38:03.849
She was covering his face
with a pillow,

38:03.882 --> 38:07.353
screaming "Shut up! Shut up!"

38:07.386 --> 38:12.958
He was fighting, but he just
wasn't strong enough.

38:12.991 --> 38:15.561
Then he just stopped moving.

38:20.999 --> 38:22.401
Come on.

38:30.476 --> 38:31.677
Where are you
taking her?

38:31.710 --> 38:33.579
Away from this place.

38:38.116 --> 38:39.651
Got good news.

38:39.685 --> 38:41.086
We found Megan.

38:41.119 --> 38:43.088
Yeah, that is good news.

38:43.121 --> 38:44.723
Is she okay?

38:44.756 --> 38:45.757
Oh, yeah,
she's doing fine.

38:45.791 --> 38:47.426
That's pretty slick:

38:47.459 --> 38:50.028
hiding a murder witness
in a loony bin,

38:50.061 --> 38:51.963
telling them
she was a psycho.

38:51.997 --> 38:53.599
Yeah, well, obviously,
the girl is disturbed.

38:53.632 --> 38:54.600
She not
that disturbed.

38:54.633 --> 38:57.369
She told me what happened.

38:57.403 --> 38:58.770
Said she saw you

38:58.804 --> 39:01.607
kill Jamie.
Well, she's lying.

39:01.640 --> 39:03.675
Who you think
a jury's gonna believe:

39:03.709 --> 39:06.778
me... or some
teenage delinquent?

39:06.812 --> 39:07.879
After they see

39:07.913 --> 39:08.947
how you cut her face,

39:08.980 --> 39:10.115
I think they're gonna
believe her.

39:10.148 --> 39:11.583
She cut herself, okay?

39:11.617 --> 39:13.619
She's psychotic.

39:13.652 --> 39:15.587
And Jamie
smothered himself, too.

39:15.621 --> 39:17.756
No, my loser husband
did that.

39:17.789 --> 39:19.825
And I've heard enough.
I'm going home.

39:22.828 --> 39:24.763
Sam...

39:26.498 --> 39:27.999
What're you doing here?

39:28.033 --> 39:30.402
I watched you
through that window.

39:30.436 --> 39:32.404
You told me it
was an accident.

39:32.438 --> 39:35.607
You did it.
You confessed.

39:35.641 --> 39:36.808
No!

39:36.842 --> 39:38.176
I could never
have hurt Jamie.

39:38.209 --> 39:40.412
I wanted him to be our son!

39:42.481 --> 39:44.149
You killed him.

39:44.182 --> 39:45.617
Don't you do
this to me, Sam.

39:45.651 --> 39:47.118
I'm not going to
protect you anymore.

39:47.152 --> 39:48.954
Protect me?!
You never protected me!

39:48.987 --> 39:50.121
You promised me

39:50.155 --> 39:52.858
everything
and you gave me nothing!

39:52.891 --> 39:54.993
I've wasted my life on you!

39:57.863 --> 40:01.199
I loved you, Lori-Ann.

40:01.232 --> 40:02.801
I believed your lies.

40:04.770 --> 40:06.037
I let you
hurt those kids.

40:06.071 --> 40:07.639
You weak son of a bitch!

40:10.676 --> 40:13.745
You don't give a damn
about anyone.

40:15.180 --> 40:17.449
MUNCH:
Lori-Ann Dufoy,
you are under arrest

40:17.483 --> 40:18.850
for the murder
of Jamie Semple.

40:18.884 --> 40:20.686
You have the right
to remain silent.

40:20.719 --> 40:22.187
You have the right
to an attorney...

40:23.188 --> 40:24.823
You okay?

40:24.856 --> 40:26.992
I'm cool.
