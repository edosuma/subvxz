WEBVTT

00:07.378 --> 00:08.373
No, Mike, stop.

00:08.440 --> 00:09.864
Whoa.

00:09.932 --> 00:11.269
- Smooth.
- Sorry.

00:11.337 --> 00:13.302
You woulda made
a nice ballerina.

00:13.370 --> 00:16.706
I'm not gonna apologize
for my lithe physique, okay?

00:16.772 --> 00:18.338
And, by the way,
I was on the wrestling team

00:18.406 --> 00:20.609
in high school, so...

00:20.677 --> 00:22.522
Is something funny?

00:22.590 --> 00:25.064
I'm just trying to imagine
you fighting someone.

00:25.131 --> 00:27.337
Oh-oh-oh.
I would kill you.

00:27.405 --> 00:29.074
- You wouldn't touch me.
- Why not?

00:29.142 --> 00:31.145
Because you'd be too busy
staring at me in tights.

00:31.213 --> 00:32.345
No, I wouldn't.

00:32.414 --> 00:33.714
You're doing it right now.

00:33.782 --> 00:35.151
You're not wearing any tights.

00:35.219 --> 00:36.522
I'm not wearing any underwear.

00:36.590 --> 00:38.424
I'm--you--

00:43.632 --> 00:45.268
Okay, so, Mrs. Williams,

00:45.336 --> 00:47.003
we're gonna take you
to the deposition

00:47.071 --> 00:48.372
as soon as Kenny Verdasco's
finished, all right?

00:48.440 --> 00:49.973
You two draw the short straw?

00:50.041 --> 00:51.608
I'm sorry?

00:51.676 --> 00:53.644
You're in charge of
corralling the cancer patients.

00:53.712 --> 00:55.646
It's not the most glamorous
duty in the world.

00:55.713 --> 00:58.349
I supposed you two
don't mind working together.

00:58.416 --> 01:00.117
- How long you been dating?
- Oh!

01:00.185 --> 01:01.787
No, no, I'm sort of
seeing someone--

01:01.854 --> 01:03.356
It's gonna happen
sooner or later.

01:03.424 --> 01:06.028
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me for a moment.

01:06.096 --> 01:07.630
Yes?

01:07.698 --> 01:10.402
Hi, I'm sorry,
I think I'm in the wrong place.

01:10.469 --> 01:12.405
Are you here for the Emerson
Petroleum deposition?

01:12.473 --> 01:14.108
No, no, I'm an old friend
of Harvey Specter's.

01:14.176 --> 01:16.112
This place is huge.
I always get turned around.

01:16.180 --> 01:17.448
Maybe you can point me
in the right direction.

01:17.515 --> 01:18.783
Uh, no problem.

01:18.850 --> 01:20.184
You just see
those doors right there?

01:20.252 --> 01:21.086
Go through to the elevators,

01:21.153 --> 01:22.521
then up two floors,

01:22.589 --> 01:24.125
and then you're gonna
take a right,

01:24.192 --> 01:25.293
and down the hall,
and you'll see Donna.

01:25.360 --> 01:26.395
Donna.
Great, thanks.

01:26.462 --> 01:27.697
Travis Tanner.

01:27.765 --> 01:29.165
Mike Ross.
Good to meet you.

01:29.233 --> 01:30.334
Pleasure to meet you too, Mike.

01:30.402 --> 01:32.638
Take care.

01:32.705 --> 01:35.108
My wife Emily and I,
we saved every dollar

01:35.176 --> 01:36.577
I made in the army,

01:36.645 --> 01:38.647
and we moved here from
Apple Creek, New York,

01:38.715 --> 01:40.049
six years ago.

01:40.117 --> 01:42.719
We bought a brownstone,

01:42.786 --> 01:44.154
and planted a tomato garden.

01:44.222 --> 01:45.523
We had barbecues
with the neighbors.

01:45.591 --> 01:48.527
It was-- It was
a dream come true.

01:48.595 --> 01:51.198
After being diagnosed
with lung cancer,

01:51.265 --> 01:52.733
I couldn't work anymore.

01:52.800 --> 01:54.368
I mean, there's times
I have difficulty

01:54.435 --> 01:56.403
even going up the stairs
to my daughter's room.

01:56.471 --> 01:59.473
You attended Apple Creek
High School, is that right?

01:59.541 --> 02:01.041
All four years.

02:01.109 --> 02:03.344
You high school was built
in 1985.

02:03.412 --> 02:05.113
What was there before?

02:05.181 --> 02:06.848
An oil well,

02:06.916 --> 02:09.884
owned and operated
by Emerson Petroleum.

02:09.952 --> 02:13.522
Now, Kenny, why was
the high school shut down?

02:13.589 --> 02:15.290
Because 200 people
who taught at

02:15.358 --> 02:17.125
or attended Apple Creek High
were diagnosed

02:17.193 --> 02:19.494
with some form of cancer.

02:19.562 --> 02:22.064
I'm so sorry to interrupt.

02:22.132 --> 02:23.867
That's for you, Larry.

02:23.934 --> 02:25.802
Trust me, it's good.
Use it.

02:25.870 --> 02:27.104
How do you know my name?

02:27.172 --> 02:29.540
It's all in there, Larry.

02:31.577 --> 02:33.045
Hey, are you Donna?

02:33.113 --> 02:34.580
Yeah, can I help you?

02:34.648 --> 02:36.349
Yeah, Mike Ross
told me to find you.

02:36.416 --> 02:38.317
We were in the library and
one of the plaintiffs fainted,

02:38.385 --> 02:39.619
- hit their head.
- Oh, my gosh.

02:39.686 --> 02:41.155
Okay, I'm on it.
Thank you.

02:41.222 --> 02:43.557
You're welcome.

02:49.431 --> 02:51.265
Wrong office.

02:51.332 --> 02:53.767
Harvey, I have to admit,
great job making Kenny Verdasco

02:53.835 --> 02:55.602
the face of your
class action suit.

02:55.670 --> 02:58.339
I don't know
who Kenny Verdasco is.

02:58.406 --> 02:59.807
Oh, well, you better find out.

02:59.874 --> 03:01.675
How 'bout for starters
you introduce yourself

03:01.743 --> 03:03.511
or I'm calling security.
Donna!

03:03.578 --> 03:06.815
Relax, relax.
Name's Travis Tanner.

03:06.883 --> 03:10.186
You're Travis Tanner?

03:10.254 --> 03:11.655
You've heard of me.

03:11.722 --> 03:13.757
No.

03:13.825 --> 03:15.559
I'm a senior partner
with Clyde-MacPhee.

03:15.627 --> 03:17.863
- We're based in Boston.
- So are the Red Sox.

03:17.931 --> 03:19.131
I don't give a shit
about them either.

03:19.199 --> 03:20.232
That's funny.

03:20.300 --> 03:21.734
You know what's not funny,

03:21.801 --> 03:23.469
is what's happening
to Kenny Verdasco.

03:23.537 --> 03:25.605
At this moment, they're
asking him about his parents,

03:25.673 --> 03:28.675
both heavy smokers.
Nasty habit.

03:28.742 --> 03:30.878
Yes, a pack a day each.

03:30.946 --> 03:32.713
I lived with them
till I was 18.

03:32.781 --> 03:34.749
And then they'll ask
how in the army

03:34.816 --> 03:38.486
he was exposed to nickel.
Chromium, and hydrocarbons.

03:38.554 --> 03:40.322
I was an infantry soldier.

03:40.389 --> 03:42.791
I didn't have much choice
in the matter.

03:42.859 --> 03:44.961
Not to mention
the frivolous lawsuit

03:45.029 --> 03:48.465
he filed ten years ago against
the Shriver grocery chain.

03:48.533 --> 03:49.900
It wasn't frivolous.

03:49.968 --> 03:52.837
I slipped and shattered
my elbow.

03:52.904 --> 03:54.939
If they're doing such
a great job down there,

03:55.007 --> 03:56.808
what are you doing
up here in my office?

03:56.876 --> 03:58.610
'Cause I gave them all that.

03:58.678 --> 04:00.479
And when they walk
out that door,

04:00.547 --> 04:02.548
I'm gonna be the one
who fires their asses.

04:02.616 --> 04:04.617
So you coming to me
for a pep talk?

04:04.685 --> 04:06.486
You're gonna do great, kiddo.

04:06.553 --> 04:07.854
No, you see, Emerson Petroleum

04:07.922 --> 04:09.556
was gonna lose this case.

04:09.624 --> 04:11.658
So they called me in
to fix the situation.

04:11.726 --> 04:13.894
And when I beat
Pearson Hardman,

04:13.962 --> 04:15.730
I don't want anyone saying
it was because

04:15.797 --> 04:17.265
they didn't send in their best.

04:17.332 --> 04:18.833
Well, I'm sorry
to disappoint you,

04:18.901 --> 04:20.968
but Jessica Pearson's
handling this case herself.

04:21.036 --> 04:22.670
And if you think
that she's not the best,

04:22.738 --> 04:24.338
why don't you take
a run at her and find out?

04:24.406 --> 04:25.840
All right, look,
I hear what you're saying,

04:25.908 --> 04:27.542
but here's the thing.

04:27.610 --> 04:29.443
I know that you know who I am.

04:29.511 --> 04:32.313
And I also know
that during your senior year

04:32.381 --> 04:34.582
you missed out on playing
in the state championship

04:34.650 --> 04:36.317
because of your shoulder.

04:36.385 --> 04:38.452
You can't pitch
with a bad shoulder.

04:38.520 --> 04:39.654
And what do you know,

04:39.721 --> 04:42.356
they won without you, Harvey.

04:42.424 --> 04:45.593
Now ask yourself something.

04:45.661 --> 04:47.495
Are you gonna let
Jessica Pearson

04:47.562 --> 04:48.562
play the big game for you, hmm?

04:50.699 --> 04:52.667
What's so funny?

04:52.734 --> 04:54.368
I'm just thinking
about how I'm gonna enjoy

04:54.436 --> 04:55.536
kicking your ass.

04:55.604 --> 04:57.872
I'll see you in court.

www.addic7ed.com

05:35.944 --> 05:37.945
It was an attack
on my history, my family,

05:38.013 --> 05:39.213
everything I care about.

05:39.281 --> 05:40.815
I told you this was coming.

05:40.883 --> 05:42.617
They're just trying
to rattle you.

05:42.685 --> 05:44.285
Yeah, well, they're doing
a hell of a good job.

05:44.353 --> 05:46.121
Kenny, you're our
lead plaintiff.

05:46.188 --> 05:47.656
You've got to keep
your composure.

05:47.723 --> 05:49.091
I don't care about composure.

05:49.158 --> 05:50.592
I want to make a settlement.

05:50.660 --> 05:52.027
That's exactly what they want.

05:52.095 --> 05:53.462
Kenny, I'd like you to meet
Harvey Specter.

05:53.530 --> 05:54.897
He's my right hand.

05:54.965 --> 05:56.165
Can your right hand
please tell me why

05:56.233 --> 05:57.700
we shouldn't ask
for a settlement?

05:57.768 --> 05:59.002
I'm not against
settling one bit.

05:59.070 --> 06:00.203
But if we go to them,
we're weak.

06:00.271 --> 06:01.505
They come to us, we're strong.

06:01.573 --> 06:03.140
Harvey's right.

06:03.208 --> 06:04.775
They came after you because
they're running scared.

06:04.843 --> 06:07.478
Trust me, they'll come
to us soon enough.

06:07.546 --> 06:09.247
Okay.

06:09.315 --> 06:11.082
One more thing,

06:11.150 --> 06:12.884
I'm gonna postpone
the rest of the depositions.

06:12.951 --> 06:16.520
Don't tell the rest of the
plaintiffs what happened.

06:18.156 --> 06:20.657
What the hell was that?

06:20.725 --> 06:22.625
I need you to let me
take over this case.

06:22.693 --> 06:24.660
The guy that came into
my deposition.

06:24.728 --> 06:26.562
- He called you out?
- Yeah.

06:26.630 --> 06:27.896
- He's good.
- Yeah.

06:27.964 --> 06:29.731
You think I can't take him?

06:29.799 --> 06:31.132
He brought up
the state championship.

06:31.200 --> 06:33.502
- Oh, shoulder.
- Yeah.

06:33.570 --> 06:36.238
Oh, take him.

06:36.306 --> 06:38.675
- Be careful.
- I will.

06:38.742 --> 06:40.276
Bringing up
state championships,

06:40.344 --> 06:42.278
that's just--
That's wrong.

06:42.346 --> 06:43.847
Nothing I wouldn't have done.

06:49.054 --> 06:51.055
Thanks.

06:51.122 --> 06:54.024
I need you to dig into
Travis Tanner.

06:54.091 --> 06:55.525
Find out where he's worked,
where he's gone to school,

06:55.592 --> 06:56.859
what cases he's won.

06:56.927 --> 06:57.960
Why, you thinking
about starting

06:58.028 --> 06:59.829
a Wikipedia page for him?

06:59.896 --> 07:01.697
I don't know anything about
how this guy operates.

07:01.764 --> 07:03.165
And before I make a move,
I need to know everything

07:03.232 --> 07:04.833
about how this guy operates.

07:04.900 --> 07:07.035
Right, for his Wikipedia page.

07:07.103 --> 07:08.803
You think the Mavericks
didn't watch game film

07:08.871 --> 07:10.038
on LeBron before
they played the Heat?

07:10.105 --> 07:11.606
You're Harvey Specter.

07:11.673 --> 07:13.307
You don't need
to watch game film.

07:13.375 --> 07:15.043
Do you know who's watched
more game film than anybody?

07:15.111 --> 07:17.078
- No. Who?
- Michael Jordan.

07:17.146 --> 07:18.647
What?
How do you know that?

07:18.715 --> 07:23.119
You don't believe me?
Let's call him.

07:23.187 --> 07:25.189
You have Michael Jordan's
phone number.

07:25.256 --> 07:26.757
Yep.

07:26.825 --> 07:28.192
If I hit this button
right here,

07:28.260 --> 07:29.794
I call Michael Jordan?

07:29.862 --> 07:31.997
That's kinda how a phone works.

07:32.064 --> 07:34.332
Speed dial 23.

07:34.400 --> 07:36.034
- I'm doing it.
- Go for it.

07:36.102 --> 07:37.936
I'm gonna ask him
about baseball.

07:38.004 --> 07:39.638
Do not ask him about baseball.

07:39.706 --> 07:41.306
Ahh!
Wrong-- Wrong number.

07:41.374 --> 07:43.275
You're kidding me.

07:43.342 --> 07:44.777
Oh, my God.

07:44.844 --> 07:47.913
Who are you?

07:47.981 --> 07:50.082
Everybody stop
what you're doing,

07:50.150 --> 07:53.086
stand up, and follow me
in the library.

07:53.154 --> 07:55.021
Mike, that goes for you too,
up and at 'em.

07:55.089 --> 07:56.689
Uh, yeah, Louis, I'd love to,

07:56.757 --> 07:57.724
but I have some work
to do for--

07:57.792 --> 07:59.159
His Majesty can wait.

07:59.226 --> 08:00.660
All associates
in the library now.

08:00.728 --> 08:03.630
Let's go.

08:03.698 --> 08:06.033
Let's go.

08:06.101 --> 08:07.601
Rumor is we're getting
our annual raises early.

08:07.668 --> 08:09.102
People are freaking out.

08:09.170 --> 08:11.104
That's great, Harold.

08:11.172 --> 08:12.705
I'm thinking about
getting a tattoo.

08:12.773 --> 08:14.841
You need a raise for that?

08:14.909 --> 08:16.276
I'm really overpaying
for my apartment.

08:16.344 --> 08:17.911
Good morning, everyone.

08:17.979 --> 08:19.379
Many of you seem to think

08:19.447 --> 08:21.748
this is about
getting your raises early.

08:21.816 --> 08:23.716
- It isn't.
- Suck.

08:23.784 --> 08:25.952
We've discovered a breach
at the firm.

08:26.020 --> 08:29.322
A confidential witness list
was leaked to a rival firm,

08:29.390 --> 08:31.224
Wakefield-Cady.

08:31.291 --> 08:32.792
Now it's entirely possible

08:32.859 --> 08:34.760
that this was
an honest mistake.

08:34.828 --> 08:36.361
If so, we urge
the responsible party

08:36.429 --> 08:37.996
to come forward.

08:38.063 --> 08:41.299
If not, we'll find out
soon enough.

08:41.368 --> 08:45.137
Either way, we will get
to the bottom of this.

08:45.205 --> 08:47.640
Louis.

08:53.347 --> 08:56.883
Jessica seems to think
a mistake's been made.

08:56.950 --> 08:59.218
I don't believe so.

08:59.286 --> 09:02.021
I also don't believe
this is a matter of ethics.

09:02.089 --> 09:04.457
It's a matter of loyalty.

09:04.525 --> 09:07.193
Someone in this room
has betrayed us all,

09:07.261 --> 09:09.996
and it makes me sick.

09:10.064 --> 09:13.533
The fact that it went to those
holier-than-thou pricks

09:13.601 --> 09:17.370
at Wakefield-Cady, you know
what, that makes me sicker.

09:17.438 --> 09:19.339
Now, you all work together,

09:19.406 --> 09:21.441
in the trenches,
shoulder-to-shoulder,

09:21.509 --> 09:24.978
which means one of you
must know who did this.

09:25.046 --> 09:27.380
Now if y'all harbor knowledge
of the perpetrator

09:27.448 --> 09:29.415
and do not turn him in,

09:29.483 --> 09:31.317
you're as bad
as the perpetrator himself,

09:31.385 --> 09:33.218
you along with the perpetrator
will be fired.

09:33.286 --> 09:35.320
He's doing George W. Bush.

09:35.388 --> 09:37.155
You're either with us
or against us, folks.

09:37.223 --> 09:39.124
He sounds like Bush,
but he looks just like Cheney.

09:42.128 --> 09:44.829
You got something
to tell me, Harold?

09:44.897 --> 09:46.297
- Uh-uh.
- No?

09:46.365 --> 09:48.032
Not that dermatological problem

09:48.100 --> 09:49.433
that you were talking
about earlier in my office?

09:49.501 --> 09:51.035
- No, not that one?
- No.

09:51.102 --> 09:53.370
To show you how serious I am,

09:53.438 --> 09:55.205
I have an incentive.

09:55.273 --> 09:57.407
Whoever turns this traitor in

09:57.475 --> 10:01.744
receives $10,000.

10:01.812 --> 10:05.014
You're welcome.

10:05.081 --> 10:07.549
Feel free to go back to work.

10:07.617 --> 10:09.718
$10,000, that's a big tattoo.

10:09.786 --> 10:13.055
Yeah, it'd be huge.

10:13.123 --> 10:15.091
Why?

10:15.158 --> 10:17.393
- Louis, there was a--
- I don't care.

10:17.461 --> 10:18.995
Tell me what you learned
about Travis Tanner.

10:19.063 --> 10:20.497
It's all in there.

10:20.564 --> 10:22.165
Travis Tanner went to Yale,

10:22.233 --> 10:23.934
undergrad in Law,
honors in both.

10:24.002 --> 10:25.903
He was a junior tennis champion.

10:25.970 --> 10:27.905
Tennis.
Just like Louis.

10:27.973 --> 10:29.374
Yeah, he played in college too.

10:29.442 --> 10:31.176
- Oh, my God.
- More importantly,

10:31.243 --> 10:34.112
he was the youngest senior
partner at Clyde-MacPhee.

10:34.180 --> 10:35.980
This guy's record
is off the charts.

10:36.048 --> 10:37.548
Really?

10:37.616 --> 10:39.450
He specializes in breaking
class action lawsuits.

10:39.518 --> 10:41.118
Harris Tobacco, Bell Pesticide,

10:41.186 --> 10:43.287
Gravtech Securities,
he broke 'em all.

10:43.355 --> 10:46.023
How come I've
never heard of him?

10:46.090 --> 10:48.091
Evidentially, he doesn't
like to take public credit.

10:48.159 --> 10:50.861
Stays off the radar,
he avoids the press.

10:50.929 --> 10:53.297
I only found this stuff by
looking through court records.

10:53.365 --> 10:54.833
Now it makes sense.

10:54.900 --> 10:56.268
What?

10:56.335 --> 10:57.869
Why he thinks I know him.

10:57.937 --> 10:59.638
I know those other attorneys.

10:59.706 --> 11:01.373
He thinks they've
told me about him.

11:01.441 --> 11:02.608
- They never did?
- No.

11:02.676 --> 11:04.644
- Why not?
- Because he beat them.

11:04.712 --> 11:07.147
This guy's kind of a badass.

11:07.215 --> 11:08.515
You want me to get you
an autograph?

11:08.583 --> 11:11.218
No, I'm just
respecting our foe.

11:11.286 --> 11:13.154
<i>- Foe?
- It's from the Art of War.</i>

11:13.222 --> 11:14.422
No?

11:14.490 --> 11:16.124
No, look, I need to know

11:16.192 --> 11:17.926
how those other cases
are different from ours.

11:17.993 --> 11:20.295
Well, those other cases
were spread out

11:20.363 --> 11:22.564
geographically,
economically, socially.

11:22.632 --> 11:24.332
Ours is in a single town,

11:24.400 --> 11:28.302
a single school with
a single cluster of plaintiffs.

11:28.370 --> 11:32.807
That tennis-playing douchebag
Travis Tanner's on the phone.

11:32.875 --> 11:34.242
You know I listen.

11:38.647 --> 11:40.481
Travis, what can I do for you?

11:40.549 --> 11:42.450
Yeah, I'm happy
to discuss the case,

11:42.518 --> 11:44.352
on one condition.

11:44.420 --> 11:47.155
You're gonna meet me
at Apple Creek High School.

11:47.222 --> 11:48.957
See you in an hour.

11:49.024 --> 11:50.458
Why do you want to meet there?

11:50.526 --> 11:52.293
Because that's ground zero.

11:52.360 --> 11:54.194
And I want the emotion
of that school under my feet

11:54.262 --> 11:55.596
when I negotiate.

11:55.663 --> 11:57.431
I thought you were
against emotions.

11:57.498 --> 11:58.865
I'm against having emotions,

11:58.933 --> 12:00.533
not against using them.

12:00.601 --> 12:02.368
Come on, I thought
we were homies.

12:02.436 --> 12:04.337
Jimmy, I didn't leak anything.

12:04.404 --> 12:06.005
You know, I remember you said

12:06.072 --> 12:07.706
you hated Louis Litt
and you were second-guessing

12:07.774 --> 12:09.308
your decision
to become a lawyer.

12:09.376 --> 12:11.410
I told you that in confidence
over six cosmopolitans.

12:11.478 --> 12:13.446
It doesn't mean
you're not the guy.

12:13.513 --> 12:15.514
Harold, really?
You drink cosmopolitans?

12:15.582 --> 12:17.083
Stop doing that
unless you're with girls,

12:17.151 --> 12:18.418
which you never are.

12:18.486 --> 12:19.386
And, Jimmy, are you kidding me,

12:19.453 --> 12:20.921
going after Harold?

12:20.989 --> 12:22.189
What, how do you know
he didn't do it?

12:22.257 --> 12:23.324
How do we know
you didn't do it?

12:23.392 --> 12:24.992
Maybe you're the guy.

12:25.060 --> 12:26.494
Oh, my God, guys,
this is ridiculous.

12:26.562 --> 12:28.129
All right, has it occurred
to any of you

12:28.197 --> 12:29.731
that maybe this is all
just a big test?

12:29.799 --> 12:31.466
Wow, wow, spoken like a person

12:31.534 --> 12:33.301
with something to hide.

12:33.369 --> 12:35.370
Louis was talking
about loyalty.

12:35.438 --> 12:37.572
Maybe this is just some test
to see how loyal we are

12:37.640 --> 12:40.041
- by not turning on each other.
- Are you kidding?

12:40.108 --> 12:41.142
Jessica would never play along
with something like that.

12:41.209 --> 12:42.743
Even if it's not a test,

12:42.810 --> 12:44.177
<i>this is a law office,
not Lord of the Flies.</i>

12:44.245 --> 12:46.913
Everybody get back to work.

12:49.250 --> 12:52.852
Are these the Galusska briefs?

12:54.789 --> 12:56.623
You guys, Louis has been
hounding us for these.

12:56.691 --> 12:59.593
Why hasn't anyone
taken them to him?

12:59.661 --> 13:01.462
Are you serious?

13:01.530 --> 13:05.267
Wow.
You're scared of him.

13:05.334 --> 13:08.102
He's Louis Litt,
he's not Darth Vader.

13:08.170 --> 13:10.638
This is what courage looks like.
Jimmy, pay attention.

13:10.706 --> 13:12.507
Please.

13:12.574 --> 13:15.109
Louis, the Galusska briefs.

13:15.176 --> 13:16.977
Sorry they're late.

13:17.045 --> 13:19.547
Hmm, only two days late.

13:35.428 --> 13:37.763
- Sure you're ready for this?
- I'm here, aren't I?

13:37.831 --> 13:40.198
I've been looking into you.
You're an elusive man.

13:40.266 --> 13:41.766
Yeah, well,
when you're number one,

13:41.834 --> 13:43.701
you don't need to broadcast
your victories, Harvey.

13:43.769 --> 13:45.503
That's funny.
Where I come from,

13:45.571 --> 13:47.605
number one doesn't usually
challenge number two

13:47.673 --> 13:49.507
to a fight.

13:49.575 --> 13:51.675
This school
was Apple Creek's pride.

13:51.743 --> 13:53.711
Parents felt safe sending
their children here,

13:53.779 --> 13:55.812
and teachers felt safe
teaching here.

13:55.880 --> 13:58.115
You know what Apple Creek
High School is now?

13:58.182 --> 14:00.050
A bunch of trailers
on the outskirts of town.

14:00.117 --> 14:02.819
All because 30 years ago
your clients failed

14:02.886 --> 14:04.654
to cap an oil well
and gave them all cancer.

14:04.721 --> 14:06.389
You see all these
power lines around here?

14:06.456 --> 14:08.257
They crisscross
the entire town.

14:08.325 --> 14:11.259
Two miles down that road,
paint factory.

14:11.327 --> 14:12.794
You got a microwave tower.

14:12.862 --> 14:14.496
And all this grass
that you see?

14:14.564 --> 14:16.297
It's been treated
with pesticide every week

14:16.365 --> 14:18.066
for 20 years.

14:18.133 --> 14:20.034
You say it's our fault.
I say you're wrong.

14:20.102 --> 14:23.137
That office, Mitch Rosewall,

14:23.205 --> 14:26.207
soccer coach, brain cancer.

14:26.275 --> 14:27.742
Library, Monica Dodd,
volunteer.

14:27.809 --> 14:30.745
She ran it for years.
Stomach cancer.

14:30.813 --> 14:32.646
They both died last month,

14:32.714 --> 14:34.248
and they sure as hell didn't
die from pesticide.

14:34.316 --> 14:35.783
- Can you prove it?
- If we go to trial,

14:35.851 --> 14:38.386
it won't be
about proving anything.

14:38.454 --> 14:42.090
It'll be about Monica,
Mitch, and Kenny,

14:42.158 --> 14:44.059
and you won't stand a chance.

14:44.127 --> 14:47.630
Ah, this is fun, Harvey.

14:47.698 --> 14:49.732
I'm just sorry to say

14:49.800 --> 14:52.101
that we won't get
to do this in court.

14:52.169 --> 14:54.570
Against my advice,
Emerson wants to settle.

14:54.638 --> 14:56.105
You're kidding me.

14:56.173 --> 14:57.807
After all this,
you want to settle.

14:57.875 --> 15:01.077
No, I don't,
but those are my instructions.

15:01.144 --> 15:03.513
Call it a draw.

15:13.956 --> 15:16.524
Mike, get over
to Kenny's house.

15:16.592 --> 15:19.193
Tanner's gonna try
and make him cave.

15:27.899 --> 15:31.135
I came as soon
as I got the message.

15:31.203 --> 15:33.371
Kenny.

15:33.439 --> 15:35.407
It's Harvey Specter.

15:35.475 --> 15:37.844
Was Travis Tanner here?
I was just with him.

15:37.911 --> 15:39.779
He couldn't have beaten
me by much.

15:39.847 --> 15:41.213
Sweetie, why don't
you go inside, okay, baby?

15:41.281 --> 15:43.316
Okay.

15:43.383 --> 15:45.184
No, it wasn't him.

15:45.252 --> 15:47.386
It was someone else.
He wouldn't tell me his name.

15:47.454 --> 15:48.387
He said he was
with Pearson-Hardman,

15:48.455 --> 15:49.455
so I let him in.

15:49.522 --> 15:51.290
Did he mention Tanner's name?

15:51.358 --> 15:52.491
No, but it was obvious
that's who he worked for.

15:52.559 --> 15:53.759
He said me
and the other plaintiffs

15:53.827 --> 15:55.427
were gonna get
a settlement offer soon.

15:55.495 --> 15:57.162
- What else?
- He said if we don't take it,

15:57.230 --> 15:58.530
that they're gonna go after us.

15:58.598 --> 16:00.164
That they have dirt
on everyone.

16:00.232 --> 16:01.132
He mentioned
Eva Williams' arrest

16:01.200 --> 16:02.634
for public intoxication,

16:02.701 --> 16:03.735
Bernie Rutherford's
shoplifting arrest

16:03.803 --> 16:05.003
when he was in college.

16:05.071 --> 16:06.572
That's criminal intimidation.

16:06.640 --> 16:07.773
If they want
to go after me, that's fine.

16:07.841 --> 16:09.408
I can handle it.

16:09.476 --> 16:11.844
But the others,
I don't know if they can.

16:11.912 --> 16:13.313
You have to stay strong, Kenny.

16:13.380 --> 16:15.381
You cave,
everything falls apart.

16:15.449 --> 16:17.083
One more thing,
what did this guy look like?

16:17.151 --> 16:18.785
I don't know,
he was average height,

16:18.853 --> 16:20.554
brown hair, brown eyes.

16:20.621 --> 16:23.456
Thanks.

16:23.524 --> 16:25.457
Want me to start figuring out
who this guy is?

16:25.525 --> 16:27.960
No.
We'll never find him.

16:36.802 --> 16:39.170
How'd you know Tanner
was going after Kenny?

16:39.237 --> 16:41.371
'Cause if I was the type
to go out of bounds,

16:41.439 --> 16:42.606
that's exactly what I'd do.

16:42.674 --> 16:44.742
- You're not?
- No.

16:44.810 --> 16:46.577
So what's our next move?

16:46.645 --> 16:47.678
I'm calling in reinforcements.

16:47.746 --> 16:49.347
What do you mean?

16:49.414 --> 16:51.616
If Tanner sent a guy
to intimidate Kenny,

16:51.684 --> 16:53.218
he's got something else
up his sleeve,

16:53.286 --> 16:55.187
and I want to know what it is.

16:55.255 --> 16:56.956
What?

16:57.024 --> 16:59.693
Nothing, you guys are like
two sides of the same coin.

16:59.760 --> 17:01.795
What are you saying,
he's another me?

17:01.863 --> 17:03.963
No one is another me.

17:04.031 --> 17:05.765
I mean, you told Donna
I was another you.

17:05.833 --> 17:07.532
I never said that.

17:07.601 --> 17:09.601
You said you were looking
for another you,

17:09.669 --> 17:12.270
and then you hired me.

17:12.338 --> 17:14.839
So see how that works?

17:14.906 --> 17:17.474
Logic.

17:21.046 --> 17:24.314
Mike, let's go.
In my office now.

17:26.685 --> 17:28.585
Oh, damn, Mike.

17:28.653 --> 17:30.821
Tell me you didn't
leak the documents, man.

17:30.889 --> 17:32.356
Are you our Benedict Arnold?

17:32.423 --> 17:33.957
Benedict Arnold,
nice reference.

17:34.025 --> 17:35.292
You helping your
high school girlfriend

17:35.360 --> 17:36.293
with her homework again?

17:36.361 --> 17:37.762
Okay, not cool, Mike.

17:37.829 --> 17:39.863
You know Darla's
in community college.

17:39.931 --> 17:42.233
I don't even know why
you laughing, Harold.

17:42.300 --> 17:45.235
You don't have a chick.

17:45.303 --> 17:46.470
She's of age.

17:51.042 --> 17:53.777
I am so very proud
of you, Mike.

17:53.845 --> 17:55.980
Wow, I really wish you
weren't touching me right now.

17:56.047 --> 17:58.549
You are what loyalty
looks like.

17:58.616 --> 18:00.585
You rooted out
the person responsible

18:00.653 --> 18:03.421
for leaking the witness list
to Wakefield-Cady.

18:03.489 --> 18:05.724
Louis, I have no idea
what you're talking about.

18:05.792 --> 18:07.192
It was almost cute
how you hid the evidence

18:07.260 --> 18:08.761
in the Galusska briefs.

18:08.829 --> 18:10.229
Like you didn't want
to take the credit.

18:10.297 --> 18:11.831
What?
Louis, I didn't hide anything.

18:11.899 --> 18:14.367
Don't worry, no one's
gonna label you a snitch.

18:14.435 --> 18:15.969
Snitch?

18:16.036 --> 18:17.737
We didn't even think
to check the fax machines.

18:17.805 --> 18:19.606
That was brilliant.

18:19.674 --> 18:22.642
The list was sent from
right here in this firm.

18:22.710 --> 18:24.911
This is a copy
of a fax submission form

18:24.978 --> 18:26.712
sent from three days ago.

18:26.780 --> 18:28.314
This doesn't implicate anybody.

18:28.382 --> 18:30.283
That's the confidential
employee code.

18:30.350 --> 18:32.618
She must not have known
that the machine recorded it.

18:32.686 --> 18:33.886
She?

18:33.954 --> 18:35.321
Wait, why am I being suspended?

18:35.389 --> 18:36.755
I didn't leak any documents.

18:36.823 --> 18:40.359
Who told Louis I did this?

18:40.426 --> 18:42.560
- Lets go please, this way miss.
- No, no, no, Louis.

18:42.628 --> 18:44.997
You have to stop this.
I didn't turn Rachel in.

18:45.065 --> 18:46.732
That's so sweet
how you didn't really mean

18:46.800 --> 18:48.268
to hand someone in.

18:48.335 --> 18:49.369
Wait, Mike, stop.

18:49.436 --> 18:51.338
You did a great thing.

18:51.405 --> 18:55.075
And because
of that great thing,

18:55.143 --> 18:57.545
$10,000, and don't spend
it in one place.

19:01.684 --> 19:03.418
You say, "Thank you, Louis."

19:03.486 --> 19:05.520
And then,
"You're welcome, Mike."

19:05.588 --> 19:06.854
- Rachel.
- I don't want to talk to you.

19:06.922 --> 19:08.790
- Hey, come on.
- You want "come on"?

19:08.858 --> 19:10.792
- Why would you do that to me?
- I didn't do anything to you.

19:10.860 --> 19:11.960
I didn't fax that goddamn list.

19:12.028 --> 19:13.528
And I didn't turn you in.

19:13.596 --> 19:14.963
Then why was I just
suspended, Mike?

19:15.031 --> 19:16.898
All I know is that I gave
Louis a stack of briefs

19:16.966 --> 19:19.400
and there was some fax with
your confidential code on it.

19:19.468 --> 19:21.002
Do you think that if I was
gonna leak firm documents,

19:21.069 --> 19:23.070
I'd be dumb enough to fax
them with my own code?

19:23.138 --> 19:24.806
No, I don't,
but whoever did this

19:24.874 --> 19:25.940
must have framed you.

19:26.008 --> 19:27.408
Yeah, well, it worked.

19:27.476 --> 19:28.776
Rachel, look, you just--

19:28.844 --> 19:30.411
They're gonna investigate this.

19:30.479 --> 19:31.779
They're gonna clear your name,
you know that.

19:31.847 --> 19:33.480
I've worked there
for five years,

19:33.548 --> 19:35.449
and this is how they treat me?

19:35.517 --> 19:37.351
I'm suspended, Mike.

19:37.419 --> 19:38.485
I'm probably gonna be fired.

19:38.553 --> 19:39.921
I should sue them.

19:39.989 --> 19:41.690
Okay, let's not
do anything rash, okay?

19:41.757 --> 19:43.725
It's not rash.
It's standing up for myself.

19:43.792 --> 19:45.560
Rachel, you--

19:45.628 --> 19:48.164
You're over-react--

19:59.511 --> 20:01.145
Excuse me.

20:01.212 --> 20:03.514
You wouldn't happen to know
what sort of wine

20:03.581 --> 20:05.348
pairs well with
a duck l'orange, would you?

20:05.416 --> 20:07.050
Try something
with a full fruit flavor,

20:07.118 --> 20:09.419
like a Cabernet Sauvignon.

20:09.487 --> 20:12.989
Eh, Sauvignons are a little
bit oaky for my palate.

20:13.057 --> 20:14.958
This article right here

20:15.026 --> 20:17.561
is all about the resurgence
of Pinot Noir.

20:23.135 --> 20:26.904
You know, you could just pay me
right out in public.

20:26.972 --> 20:28.606
But then I wouldn't
feel like James Bond.

20:28.674 --> 20:29.907
Oh, who's that make me?

20:29.975 --> 20:31.642
Pussy Galore.

20:31.710 --> 20:33.044
Octopussy?

20:33.112 --> 20:35.380
That's enough, Harvey.

20:35.447 --> 20:36.814
What do you have for me?

20:36.882 --> 20:39.617
Nothing.
On paper, Tanner's clean.

20:39.685 --> 20:41.953
He may break the rules,
but he covers his tracks.

20:42.020 --> 20:44.622
You've never come up
empty for me before.

20:44.690 --> 20:46.190
I didn't this time either.

20:46.258 --> 20:47.792
Tanner booked a conference room

20:47.860 --> 20:49.760
at the Waldorf
tomorrow at noon.

20:49.828 --> 20:51.863
Divide and conquer.

20:51.930 --> 20:53.764
He's gonna gather
my plaintiffs,

20:53.832 --> 20:57.635
scare them, and then
give them a lowball offer.

20:57.702 --> 21:00.738
And that's illegal.

21:00.806 --> 21:02.173
What?

21:02.240 --> 21:04.642
You've used me
for a lot of things.

21:04.710 --> 21:05.877
You've never asked
me to investigate

21:05.944 --> 21:07.545
another attorney before.

21:07.613 --> 21:10.048
This guy's good.

21:10.116 --> 21:11.717
If he called your plaintiffs,

21:11.785 --> 21:12.985
I can get his phone records
to prove it.

21:13.053 --> 21:14.787
He didn't make
those calls himself.

21:14.855 --> 21:18.859
He's not gonna be
at the Waldorf either tomorrow.

21:18.926 --> 21:21.394
But I will.

21:27.593 --> 21:28.793
Donna, can you tell me

21:28.861 --> 21:30.628
about these confidential
employee codes

21:30.696 --> 21:32.129
that Louis says Rachel used
to fax the witness list

21:32.197 --> 21:33.931
over to Wakefield-Cady?

21:33.999 --> 21:35.833
I have a thousand things
to do before lunch.

21:35.900 --> 21:37.535
Hold Mike's hand
while he crosses the street,

21:37.602 --> 21:38.903
not one of them.

21:38.971 --> 21:40.672
Donna, this one's for Rachel.

21:40.740 --> 21:42.574
What do you need?

21:42.642 --> 21:43.876
I know we use the billing
codes to charge the clients,

21:43.944 --> 21:45.478
but what do we use
the employee codes for?

21:45.545 --> 21:46.979
They're special codes
for when you need to use

21:47.047 --> 21:48.181
the firm's resources
for personal reasons.

21:48.248 --> 21:49.783
We can do that?

21:49.850 --> 21:51.251
- You can't, but Rachel can.
- Why?

21:51.319 --> 21:53.086
Because a fifth-year paralegal

21:53.154 --> 21:55.221
is more valuable to the firm
than a first-year associate.

21:55.289 --> 21:57.256
Okay, so do you have
a personal code?

21:57.324 --> 21:59.925
- I have two.
- So where do you get them?

21:59.993 --> 22:01.960
They're generated
by the I.T. department.

22:02.028 --> 22:03.695
We have an I.T. department?

22:03.763 --> 22:05.630
The computers
don't run themselves.

22:05.698 --> 22:08.266
At least until Skynet
goes active.

22:08.333 --> 22:10.034
Sarah O'Connor.

22:12.137 --> 22:13.704
No.

22:13.772 --> 22:16.107
- No, I'll work on that.
- Really bad.

22:16.174 --> 22:17.041
Yeah.

22:23.782 --> 22:25.951
What?

22:32.358 --> 22:35.060
Uh, hi, excuse me.
I'm looking for Benjamin.

22:35.128 --> 22:36.662
You found him.

22:36.730 --> 22:37.830
Oh, great, I'm Mike Ross.

22:37.898 --> 22:39.565
We just spoke on the phone.

22:39.633 --> 22:41.835
<i>Man, this place is like
Battlestar Galactica.</i>

22:41.902 --> 22:43.536
Where do you guys
keep the Cylons?

22:43.604 --> 22:44.972
What do they pay you guys?

22:45.039 --> 22:46.173
Pearson-Hardman
takes care of us

22:46.241 --> 22:47.741
because we're on call 24/7.

22:47.809 --> 22:48.909
If a server goes down

22:48.977 --> 22:50.711
or a partner's computer crashes,

22:50.778 --> 22:53.080
people die.

22:53.147 --> 22:54.748
That's a little dramatic,
don't you think, Ben?

22:54.816 --> 22:56.750
It's Benjamin.

22:56.818 --> 22:58.184
I'm sure you don't like it
when people call you Mike.

22:58.252 --> 22:59.786
Actually, I prefer Mike.

22:59.854 --> 23:02.322
Well, Mike, six months ago

23:02.390 --> 23:04.790
I was at Connolly White,
the network went haywire,

23:04.858 --> 23:06.692
and we were in a breach
of contract litigation

23:06.760 --> 23:08.961
worth $400 million.

23:09.029 --> 23:10.562
They needed it fixed
in an hour.

23:10.630 --> 23:12.064
No one thought
it could be done.

23:12.132 --> 23:14.066
I had the network up and
running again in 23 minutes.

23:14.134 --> 23:16.169
Is that dramatic
enough for you?

23:16.236 --> 23:18.071
Wow, you're like
a regular Zuckerberg.

23:18.138 --> 23:20.273
Z-Zuckerberg?

23:20.341 --> 23:24.144
Zuckerberg couldn't code
his way out of a paper bag.

23:24.212 --> 23:26.046
You called about
the employee codes.

23:26.114 --> 23:28.382
You're a first year.
You can't have one, sorry.

23:28.450 --> 23:30.751
Okay, well, I don't need one.

23:30.819 --> 23:32.286
I just want to know
if it's possible

23:32.354 --> 23:35.256
for someone to gain access
to somebody else's code.

23:35.323 --> 23:37.024
Sure.
For one person, me.

23:37.092 --> 23:39.027
I have access
to all of the codes.

23:39.094 --> 23:42.129
Okay, so in your short
tenure here,

23:42.197 --> 23:43.598
has anyone ever
asked you for access

23:43.665 --> 23:46.801
to someone else's code?

23:46.869 --> 23:48.936
Once.
Last week.

23:49.004 --> 23:50.271
- Who?
- I can't tell you that.

23:50.339 --> 23:51.772
Why not?

23:51.840 --> 23:53.140
I.T. officer/client privilege.

23:53.208 --> 23:55.776
Does that even exist, Ben?

23:55.844 --> 23:57.311
It does in here.

23:59.781 --> 24:05.819
All right, Ben,
why don't we make a bet?

24:05.887 --> 24:08.255
I think you mean a wager,
Michael.

24:08.323 --> 24:10.190
Yeah, sure.

24:10.258 --> 24:12.826
I'm gonna tell you every single
number on this piece of paper,

24:12.894 --> 24:15.628
and you're gonna
give me that name.

24:15.696 --> 24:17.730
And if you can't?

24:17.798 --> 24:22.268
Then I'm gonna give you
this check for 10 grand.

24:22.336 --> 24:25.271
You get one number, one comma,
one decimal point wrong,

24:25.339 --> 24:28.874
and that money is mine.

24:28.942 --> 24:30.610
Oh, and when I win,

24:30.677 --> 24:31.911
I'll also take
one of those computers.

24:31.979 --> 24:33.346
And for the record,

24:33.414 --> 24:37.016
there's not
a single comma on there.

24:37.084 --> 24:39.118
You ready?

24:43.691 --> 24:45.692
Rachel, it's Mike.

24:45.760 --> 24:48.829
I figured out who leaked
the list to Wakefield-Cady.

24:48.897 --> 24:52.365
It was Louis.
Call me back.

25:05.711 --> 25:08.113
Hi, I'm Rachel Zane.
I'm here for my job interview.

25:08.180 --> 25:10.982
- Welcome to Wakefield-Cady.
- Thank you.

25:15.255 --> 25:17.356
Okay, as soon as we get inside

25:17.424 --> 25:19.826
I need you to find
every plaintiff you interviewed

25:19.893 --> 25:22.028
and tell them they're here
under false pretenses.

25:22.096 --> 25:23.730
- Done.
- Kenny's meeting us here.

25:23.798 --> 25:26.466
We need him to identify
the man who came to see him,

25:26.534 --> 25:27.834
and we're gonna wait
for that guy to approach

25:27.902 --> 25:29.336
any of our plaintiffs.

25:29.404 --> 25:30.904
And if we connect
that guy to Tanner,

25:30.972 --> 25:32.940
then we have him
on criminal intimidation.

25:33.008 --> 25:35.042
And Emerson Petroleum will
have no choice but to settle.

25:35.110 --> 25:37.310
Hey, Kenny.
Good to see you.

25:37.378 --> 25:38.911
This is gonna be fun.

25:41.214 --> 25:42.982
You were right,

25:43.049 --> 25:45.284
he called every one of them.

25:45.351 --> 25:47.652
You see the guy?

25:47.720 --> 25:48.987
No.

25:49.055 --> 25:51.055
Start looking.

25:53.091 --> 25:54.459
Mrs. Williams,
do you remember me?

25:54.526 --> 25:55.760
I'm Mike Ross, from the office.

25:55.828 --> 25:57.529
I remember you.

25:57.597 --> 26:00.032
Do you mind if I ask you
what you're doing here today?

26:00.099 --> 26:01.867
We were invited to come
and hear a settlement offer.

26:01.935 --> 26:04.103
Really?

26:04.170 --> 26:07.307
Um, excuse me
just for a minute.

26:09.110 --> 26:10.811
He came here himself.

26:10.878 --> 26:13.380
Big mistake.

26:13.447 --> 26:14.981
Sorry to ruin
your little brunch,

26:15.048 --> 26:17.383
but I think you know damn well

26:17.451 --> 26:19.985
that you can't legally
address my clients.

26:20.053 --> 26:23.154
Hey, I just came for the juice.

26:23.222 --> 26:24.188
Mmm.

26:24.256 --> 26:25.990
Pulp free.

26:26.058 --> 26:28.793
I know I can't talk
to your clients directly.

26:28.860 --> 26:30.827
But thank God
you're here, Harv.

26:30.895 --> 26:35.032
Because what I can do
is I can talk to you.

26:35.099 --> 26:37.968
Harvey, Emerson Petroleum

26:38.036 --> 26:42.039
is offering $25,000 to each
and every one of your clients.

26:42.107 --> 26:43.574
They don't take that,

26:43.641 --> 26:45.542
this trial stretches out
for years.

26:45.610 --> 26:47.944
Cross-examinations
will be brutal.

26:48.012 --> 26:49.813
You take our settlement,

26:49.880 --> 26:53.550
and this whole thing
will be gone tomorrow.

26:53.618 --> 26:56.320
Now if any of your clients

26:56.388 --> 26:58.156
want to get in touch with me,

26:58.190 --> 27:00.892
here's my number.

27:04.965 --> 27:06.833
Mr. Ross.

27:06.900 --> 27:10.103
Harvey.

27:10.171 --> 27:12.472
Erase that number.

27:12.540 --> 27:14.074
You're not gonna get away
with what you're doing.

27:14.141 --> 27:15.742
You know that, right?

27:15.810 --> 27:17.377
What?

27:17.445 --> 27:19.113
I just addressed you
with a raised voice.

27:19.181 --> 27:21.015
Sometimes my ears
aren't so good.

27:21.083 --> 27:23.250
If other people heard me,
I apologize, Harvey.

27:23.318 --> 27:24.585
I'm just glad
you were smart enough

27:24.652 --> 27:25.986
to figure out
I booked the Waldorf.

27:29.090 --> 27:31.625
Mmm, I think I need
to take this.

27:31.693 --> 27:33.460
I'm guessing
it's one of your clients

27:33.528 --> 27:35.495
wanting to take
my settlement offer.

27:35.563 --> 27:37.597
Hello.

27:37.665 --> 27:41.767
Tanner.
I'm coming after you.

27:41.835 --> 27:43.736
Oh, I got your number.

27:57.683 --> 27:59.483
Plaintiffs are scared.

27:59.551 --> 28:03.754
They're talking about accepting
Tanner's lowball offer.

28:03.822 --> 28:06.357
Those floodgates open
and we're done.

28:06.425 --> 28:07.491
That's why I went
to go see Clarkson.

28:07.559 --> 28:08.893
The legal finance guys?

28:08.960 --> 28:10.328
If we can get
our plaintiffs a loan

28:10.395 --> 28:12.029
against a future jury award,

28:12.097 --> 28:13.797
it'll close the floodgates
and buy us more time.

28:13.865 --> 28:15.533
Those loans
aren't cheap, Harvey.

28:15.600 --> 28:16.967
Well, it's better than settling

28:17.035 --> 28:19.436
for pennies on the dollar.

28:19.504 --> 28:21.438
- Then do it.
- I tried,

28:21.506 --> 28:23.574
but they won't give us anything
without collateral.

28:23.641 --> 28:25.976
They don't think you can win.

28:26.044 --> 28:27.444
They're wrong.

28:27.512 --> 28:29.679
That's what I like to hear.

28:29.747 --> 28:32.348
I need a million dollars
to get that loan.

28:32.416 --> 28:33.816
Are you talking
about firm money?

28:33.884 --> 28:36.019
- Yeah.
- No way that happens.

28:36.086 --> 28:37.487
You don't think I'm a good bet?

28:37.554 --> 28:38.754
That has nothing to do with it.

28:38.822 --> 28:39.755
This was your case.

28:39.823 --> 28:41.590
And I gave it to you to win.

28:41.658 --> 28:43.792
Which I will do if you just
show some faith in me.

28:43.860 --> 28:45.360
You can have my faith,

28:45.427 --> 28:49.030
but you're not
getting my money.

28:58.740 --> 29:00.040
What are you doing here?

29:00.108 --> 29:02.009
I left you three messages.

29:02.077 --> 29:03.744
Louis framed you.
We can take him down.

29:03.812 --> 29:05.512
I don't want
to take him down, Mike.

29:05.580 --> 29:06.714
Why not?

29:06.781 --> 29:08.582
Because I want a fresh start.

29:08.649 --> 29:10.584
So you don't wanna work
at Pearson-Hardman anymore?

29:10.651 --> 29:12.419
I applied for a job
at Wakefield-Cady.

29:12.487 --> 29:13.587
They offered it to me
in the room.

29:13.655 --> 29:14.955
I start Monday.

29:15.023 --> 29:16.524
You took a job at the company

29:16.591 --> 29:17.758
that ended up
with the leaked list?

29:17.826 --> 29:19.059
Do you know
what that looks like?

29:19.127 --> 29:20.494
I don't care
what it looks like.

29:20.562 --> 29:21.996
I'm not guilty,
and I need a job.

29:22.063 --> 29:23.998
So the going gets rough,
and you just quit?

29:24.065 --> 29:26.567
No, I'm not quitting.
I was fired, remember?

29:26.635 --> 29:27.902
No, you were suspended,

29:27.969 --> 29:29.504
and you could still
save your job.

29:29.571 --> 29:31.472
If Louis wants me gone,
I'm gone.

29:31.540 --> 29:32.540
Rachel, Louis tried
to frame me once,

29:32.608 --> 29:33.908
and I fought back.

29:33.976 --> 29:35.009
Why aren't you doing
the same thing?

29:35.077 --> 29:36.777
Because except for you,

29:36.845 --> 29:38.879
no one from Pearson-Hardman
has contacted me at all.

29:38.947 --> 29:41.015
Why would I fight
to stay there?

29:41.083 --> 29:43.117
They're accusing me
of spilling secrets?

29:43.184 --> 29:45.418
I'll show 'em spilling secrets.

29:45.486 --> 29:47.654
I'll tell
Wakefield-Cady everything.

29:47.722 --> 29:49.889
I may not have
a photographic memory, Mike,

29:49.957 --> 29:52.959
but I sure as hell know a lot.

29:53.026 --> 29:55.361
Rachel.

30:01.568 --> 30:03.769
Moneypenny.

30:03.837 --> 30:05.471
- Don't call me that.
- Why not?

30:05.538 --> 30:07.006
Because she had
a thing for him.

30:07.073 --> 30:08.373
This is the other way around.

30:08.441 --> 30:10.209
You don't like me?

30:10.276 --> 30:11.543
Like you enough
to give you this.

30:11.611 --> 30:13.678
What's that?

30:13.746 --> 30:16.014
I tapped the phones
at Emerson Petroleum.

30:16.081 --> 30:18.716
This is a conference call
between Travis Tanner

30:18.784 --> 30:20.585
and several high-ranking
Emerson executives.

30:20.652 --> 30:22.520
I hope they're talking about
more than just the weather.

30:22.587 --> 30:24.488
They're talking about Tanner
intimidating your client.

30:24.556 --> 30:26.023
Both you and I know
that without a warrant

30:26.091 --> 30:28.025
this recording's
not admissible in court.

30:28.093 --> 30:31.628
It is if you testify that you
don't know where it came from.

30:31.696 --> 30:33.764
Why'd you do this?

30:35.533 --> 30:37.635
Because you need it.

30:37.703 --> 30:41.505
I'm not gonna commit perjury
to win a case.

30:48.713 --> 30:50.013
Oh, weird, look what I found.

30:50.081 --> 30:52.582
Oh.

30:52.650 --> 30:55.651
You are a prince among men.

30:55.719 --> 30:57.253
I don't understand
why you use skim milk

30:57.320 --> 30:59.922
and then put whipped cream
and sugar in it.

30:59.989 --> 31:02.190
Because I use skim milk,

31:02.258 --> 31:04.793
I can put whipped cream
and sugar in it.

31:04.861 --> 31:07.862
Ah.

31:07.930 --> 31:09.464
What's wrong?

31:09.532 --> 31:12.667
- Can we talk for a second?
- Yeah.

31:12.734 --> 31:16.638
Last week Louis got
Rachel's confidential code

31:16.706 --> 31:18.006
from the I.T. department.

31:18.074 --> 31:19.942
And?

31:20.010 --> 31:21.878
And it's a smoking gun.

31:21.945 --> 31:23.947
He's the one that set her up.

31:24.014 --> 31:25.782
Why would Louis
betray the firm?

31:25.850 --> 31:27.651
I don't know,
maybe he's still upset

31:27.719 --> 31:29.253
that he got passed over
for senior partner

31:29.321 --> 31:30.921
and leaked the list
before he jumped ship.

31:30.989 --> 31:32.956
Mike, Louis is a lot of things,

31:33.024 --> 31:34.858
but he's not a traitor.

31:34.926 --> 31:36.660
That man bleeds
Pearson-Hardman.

31:36.727 --> 31:37.894
He's probably wearing
Pearson-Hardman underwear

31:37.962 --> 31:39.296
right now.

31:39.364 --> 31:40.865
I went to the tennis club
with him.

31:40.932 --> 31:42.132
Trust me, he doesn't
wear underwear.

31:42.200 --> 31:43.901
I care about Rachel too.

31:43.969 --> 31:47.171
Louis didn't do this.

31:47.239 --> 31:50.641
Okay.

31:50.709 --> 31:52.243
And if you ever mention

31:52.311 --> 31:54.045
Louis' underwear situation
to me again--

31:54.113 --> 31:55.614
You're the one
that brought it up.

31:55.682 --> 31:58.484
- Go.
- Okay.

32:00.187 --> 32:02.188
74 plaintiffs.

32:02.256 --> 32:04.758
I can't believe they're willing
to cave for $25,000.

32:04.825 --> 32:06.226
Slow down.

32:06.294 --> 32:08.228
We need to figure out
how to beat Tanner.

32:08.296 --> 32:10.664
Guy's been a step ahead of me
this entire time.

32:10.732 --> 32:13.200
- It's pretty obvious why.
- Why?

32:13.267 --> 32:14.968
You told me that you knew
he'd go to Kenny

32:15.036 --> 32:16.569
because that's what you'd do,

32:16.637 --> 32:18.271
if you were willing
to go out of bounds.

32:18.339 --> 32:22.508
You anticipated him by
thinking about what you'd do.

32:22.576 --> 32:24.110
And?

32:24.177 --> 32:25.677
And that's exactly
what he's doing to you.

32:25.745 --> 32:27.613
Maybe the only way
to get ahead of this guy

32:27.680 --> 32:30.916
is to, I don't know, think
about what you wouldn't do.

32:30.983 --> 32:33.852
Surprise myself.
I like that.

32:33.920 --> 32:35.320
You're welcome.

32:35.388 --> 32:36.922
You wanna tell me
what you're doing?

32:36.990 --> 32:38.591
Nope.

32:38.659 --> 32:39.792
Doesn't seem fair to the person

32:39.860 --> 32:41.194
whose idea it was.

32:41.262 --> 32:42.963
You're gone.

32:46.935 --> 32:49.336
- You wanted to talk, talk.
- I did.

32:49.404 --> 32:52.006
I want to put
this competition aside,

32:52.073 --> 32:53.607
call it a draw.

32:53.675 --> 32:55.642
Tapping out, Harv?

32:55.710 --> 32:57.077
This isn't about that.

32:57.144 --> 32:58.878
This is about real people.

32:58.946 --> 33:00.613
You make them
a reasonable offer,

33:00.681 --> 33:02.081
I'll get them to take it.

33:02.149 --> 33:03.950
Real people?

33:04.018 --> 33:05.685
You're standing there
in a $12,000 suit

33:05.753 --> 33:07.720
asking me not to do my job.

33:07.788 --> 33:09.856
You care so much
about those real people,

33:09.923 --> 33:11.724
I suggest you give them
your lunch money

33:11.792 --> 33:13.058
but don't ask me for mine.

33:19.334 --> 33:22.970
Vanessa, I'm gonna need
that wiretap after all.

33:26.991 --> 33:28.425
- Is there any more of that?
- Last cup.

33:28.492 --> 33:29.726
- Did you make--
- Nope.

33:29.794 --> 33:31.495
Dude, that's common courtesy.

33:31.562 --> 33:34.197
You finish a pot,
you make another one.

33:34.265 --> 33:36.499
You gonna turn me
into Louis if I don't?

33:36.567 --> 33:39.269
Hmm?
Get me fired too?

33:39.337 --> 33:42.638
Michael.

33:42.706 --> 33:45.475
Benjamin,
you got something for me?

33:45.542 --> 33:47.276
Wager's a wager, fair is fair.

33:47.344 --> 33:49.378
Here's your GX-9000.

33:49.446 --> 33:50.712
You're a good man.

33:50.780 --> 33:53.348
Use it for porn, and I'll know.

33:53.416 --> 33:54.850
Weird.

33:54.917 --> 33:58.755
Hey, Louis, how you doing?

33:58.822 --> 34:01.725
Why did Benjamin
just call you Louis?

34:01.793 --> 34:04.260
I don't know.
Made a mistake.

34:06.597 --> 34:09.367
Oh.

34:09.434 --> 34:12.337
No, he didn't.

34:12.404 --> 34:16.440
He called you Louis because
he thinks you are Louis.

34:16.509 --> 34:19.543
Because you posed as Louis
to get Rachel's employee code,

34:19.612 --> 34:22.380
didn't you?

34:22.447 --> 34:24.882
Look, Mike,
it's not what you think.

34:24.949 --> 34:28.951
It's exactly what I think.

34:29.018 --> 34:30.886
Go on.
Start talking, Jimmy,

34:30.954 --> 34:32.554
or I'll get get Benjamin

34:32.621 --> 34:34.489
and we can all go see
Jessica together.

34:34.556 --> 34:37.625
Listen.

34:37.692 --> 34:40.060
Wakefield-Cady offered me
a junior partnership

34:40.128 --> 34:41.829
if I leaked the witness list.

34:41.897 --> 34:45.498
No, no, listen, Mike.
I have huge law school debts.

34:45.567 --> 34:47.868
Okay?
I mean, don't you?

34:47.936 --> 34:49.870
I can't wait
for Pearson-Hardman

34:49.938 --> 34:51.405
to make me a partner.

34:51.473 --> 34:55.876
So what are you still
doing here then?

34:55.944 --> 34:57.945
After I gave them the list,

34:58.013 --> 34:59.547
they reneged on the offer.

34:59.614 --> 35:00.982
Big surprise.

35:01.049 --> 35:02.983
I didn't see that one coming.

35:03.051 --> 35:07.321
Just don't turn me in, Mike,
please.

35:07.389 --> 35:10.491
I came from nothing.

35:10.558 --> 35:12.993
I worked my ass off
to get into Harvard Law

35:13.061 --> 35:14.962
and become an associate here.

35:15.030 --> 35:17.431
You know who else
worked their ass off?

35:17.499 --> 35:20.334
Rachel Zane,
the paralegal who got fired

35:20.402 --> 35:21.770
because of what you did.

35:21.837 --> 35:23.972
I didn't know it was her code.

35:24.040 --> 35:25.507
I just needed
some numbers, man.

35:25.575 --> 35:26.876
I didn't think
I was gonna get caught.

35:28.545 --> 35:30.280
Look, Mike, I made one mistake.

35:30.347 --> 35:32.082
Okay?

35:32.150 --> 35:34.451
I mean, haven't you
ever cut some corners?

35:34.519 --> 35:37.154
Done some things you regretted?

35:43.762 --> 35:46.630
Jimmy, I like you, man, okay?

35:46.698 --> 35:48.698
But to clear Rachel's name,

35:48.766 --> 35:51.668
they have to know
she wasn't the one.

35:51.735 --> 35:54.470
If you come forward,

35:54.538 --> 35:56.539
maybe they fire you.

35:56.606 --> 35:58.708
If I turn you in,

35:58.776 --> 36:02.345
it's gonna follow you
for the rest of your career.

36:02.413 --> 36:04.781
It's up to you.

36:10.889 --> 36:12.891
Harvey, I'm gonna
do you a favor.

36:12.959 --> 36:15.293
Why don't you tell Mike Ross
to take a hike?

36:15.361 --> 36:17.663
He can stay.

36:17.730 --> 36:21.665
Okay.

36:21.733 --> 36:24.034
You see, 95 of your plaintiffs

36:24.102 --> 36:26.570
have already called me
about the settlement.

36:26.638 --> 36:27.838
It's just a matter of time

36:27.905 --> 36:29.305
before the rest of them
see the light.

36:29.373 --> 36:30.840
I win.

36:30.908 --> 36:32.308
I don't know
the last time you checked,

36:32.376 --> 36:33.810
but as of this morning

36:33.878 --> 36:35.978
all 200 of my plaintiffs
are staying with me.

36:36.046 --> 36:37.679
Bullshit.

36:37.747 --> 36:39.048
I got them an advance
against their settlement.

36:39.115 --> 36:40.549
No finance company
in their right mind

36:40.617 --> 36:42.684
will back your suit.

36:42.752 --> 36:44.487
I don't know if they
taught you math at Yale,

36:44.554 --> 36:46.055
but that's 5 million.

36:46.122 --> 36:48.457
$25,000 a plaintiff.

36:48.524 --> 36:51.060
Exactly what you tried
to buy them off for.

36:51.127 --> 36:53.896
You know what this means?

36:53.964 --> 36:56.199
I'm gonna hammer them all
one by one,

36:56.267 --> 36:58.568
break them down,
and it's gonna get ugly.

36:58.636 --> 37:00.838
No, you're not.

37:00.905 --> 37:02.907
What the hell is that?

37:02.975 --> 37:06.077
It's a conversation between
you and Emerson Petroleum

37:06.144 --> 37:09.314
discussing how you sent a man
to intimidate Kenny Verdasco.

37:09.382 --> 37:11.116
Take a listen.

37:11.184 --> 37:13.085
Don't worry,
it's not gonna give you cancer.

37:13.153 --> 37:15.955
No matter what that is,
it's not admissible.

37:16.022 --> 37:18.824
Unless of course you had
a warrant, which you didn't.

37:20.761 --> 37:23.128
Showed up on my doorstep.

37:23.196 --> 37:25.030
And I declared that
in this affidavit

37:25.098 --> 37:28.700
which I'm about
to send to court.

37:28.768 --> 37:30.169
Hmm.

37:30.236 --> 37:32.405
So you're gonna
perjure yourself

37:32.472 --> 37:33.973
just to win this case?

37:34.041 --> 37:36.476
No, I'm not gonna
perjure myself.

37:36.543 --> 37:38.644
Even if I were, it wouldn't be
just to win this case.

37:38.712 --> 37:41.080
It'd be to get your ass
thrown in jail.

37:41.148 --> 37:43.216
See, you have
power of attorney,

37:43.283 --> 37:44.718
and you're gonna accept
this settlement,

37:44.785 --> 37:46.453
$2 million a plaintiff.

37:46.520 --> 37:47.921
You're gonna take it.

37:47.988 --> 37:49.723
And you and that
shit-eating grin

37:49.790 --> 37:51.157
are gonna fly back to Boston

37:51.225 --> 37:52.625
and never come back
to my town again.

38:02.670 --> 38:05.004
You can use mine.

38:21.756 --> 38:25.059
Told you I'd get his autograph.

38:25.127 --> 38:27.662
I can't believe you.

38:27.730 --> 38:29.231
You were gonna perjure
yourself just to win.

38:29.298 --> 38:31.100
I thought you didn't
cross lines,

38:31.167 --> 38:33.102
that that's the difference
between guys like you and him.

38:33.170 --> 38:36.138
I had no intention
of submitting this affidavit.

38:36.206 --> 38:37.907
I'm not gonna perjure myself,

38:37.975 --> 38:40.176
but Tanner doesn't know that,
and he never will.

38:40.244 --> 38:42.045
How do you know?

38:42.112 --> 38:43.646
Because a man who's willing
to break the rules

38:43.713 --> 38:45.081
can't imagine
someone else wouldn't.

38:45.149 --> 38:46.316
You said that
you took my advice

38:46.383 --> 38:48.218
and that you
surprised yourself.

38:48.286 --> 38:49.719
I did.

38:49.787 --> 38:51.288
That loan I got
for the plaintiffs,

38:51.355 --> 38:54.257
I put up a million dollars
of my own money to get it.

38:54.325 --> 38:58.094
If that's not having emotion,
I don't know what is.

38:58.162 --> 39:01.230
- Get out.
- That seemed a little angry.

39:01.298 --> 39:03.166
Feeling good?
Satisfied? Happy?

39:03.234 --> 39:04.467
All right.

39:04.535 --> 39:06.870
Emotional.

39:13.944 --> 39:15.945
Okay, maybe a little happy.

39:19.650 --> 39:22.218
$2 million?

39:22.286 --> 39:24.220
Didn't I tell you
he was my right hand?

39:24.287 --> 39:26.655
- I don't know what to say.
- Don't say anything.

39:26.723 --> 39:28.924
Tell me what it's like when you
deliver this news to everyone.

39:28.992 --> 39:31.393
Thank you.

39:35.331 --> 39:36.798
Told you I'd win.

39:36.866 --> 39:39.201
And it's a good thing too.

39:39.268 --> 39:42.170
Because if you hadn't, oh...

39:42.238 --> 39:44.906
What, oh?

39:44.974 --> 39:47.242
There's no way we're gonna
cover that million dollars.

39:47.310 --> 39:49.678
- None of it?
- Nope.

39:49.746 --> 39:51.546
Hey, how's your shoulder?

39:51.614 --> 39:53.949
Amazing.

40:05.695 --> 40:06.895
You called me?

40:06.963 --> 40:09.498
Sure did.

40:10.967 --> 40:12.534
Have a seat.

40:12.602 --> 40:14.837
I prefer to stand.

40:14.905 --> 40:17.873
Fair enough.

40:17.941 --> 40:21.644
Uh, I made a mistake.

40:21.712 --> 40:23.846
You were unfairly punished,

40:23.914 --> 40:25.614
and I would like to officially

40:25.682 --> 40:27.716
just welcome you back.

40:27.784 --> 40:30.185
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

40:30.253 --> 40:32.722
Are you kidding me?

40:32.790 --> 40:35.024
You think I'm gonna make it
that easy on you?

40:37.027 --> 40:39.829
I want a raise.

40:39.897 --> 40:42.765
- 3%.
- 10%.

40:42.833 --> 40:46.202
- 7%.
- 10%.

40:46.269 --> 40:47.970
Fine.

40:48.038 --> 40:49.338
And Pearson-Hardman
pays for law school

40:49.406 --> 40:50.973
when I decide to go.

40:51.041 --> 40:53.342
Agreed.

40:53.410 --> 40:55.978
And one more thing.

40:56.046 --> 40:58.180
This shoulda been the first
words out of your mouth

40:58.248 --> 41:00.415
when I walked in here.

41:00.483 --> 41:04.286
You need to apologize to me
right now

41:04.353 --> 41:06.054
or I'm gonna file a lawsuit

41:06.122 --> 41:07.622
against you
first thing in the morning.

41:07.690 --> 41:10.625
You're right.

41:10.693 --> 41:12.660
I should have apologized.

41:12.727 --> 41:16.830
But don't you threaten me.

41:16.898 --> 41:19.065
I followed procedure
to the letter,

41:19.133 --> 41:21.134
and you have no basis
for a lawsuit.

41:21.202 --> 41:22.670
No, I don't.

41:22.737 --> 41:24.671
Not about this.

41:24.739 --> 41:26.741
But if you don't think
I have a basis

41:26.808 --> 41:31.245
for all the shit you've pulled
over the years I've been here,

41:31.313 --> 41:32.880
think again.

41:36.251 --> 41:38.352
I'm sorry.

41:38.420 --> 41:39.787
Okay?

41:50.133 --> 41:52.735
How'd it go?

41:52.802 --> 41:53.969
I don't know if you
had plans tonight,

41:54.037 --> 41:55.237
but you're gonna cancel
and help me put

41:55.305 --> 41:56.739
my office back together.

41:56.806 --> 41:58.273
Sure thing.

41:58.341 --> 42:00.708
So long as you don't quit
halfway through.

42:00.776 --> 42:02.644
Thank you, Mike.

42:02.712 --> 42:06.047
Yeah, sure thing.

42:09.045 --> 42:12.428
- So, where does this go?
- There.
