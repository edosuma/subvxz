WEBVTT

00:05.522 --> 00:08.422
Well, we're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:08.560 --> 00:11.287
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:11.425 --> 00:14.773
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:15.946 --> 00:18.742
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:18.880 --> 00:20.986
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:21.918 --> 00:25.887
We finally got
a piece of the pie

00:27.441 --> 00:30.030
Fish don't fry
in the kitchen

00:30.168 --> 00:32.722
Beans don't burn
on the grill

00:32.860 --> 00:35.069
Took a whole lot of tryin'

00:35.207 --> 00:37.934
Just to get up that hill

00:38.072 --> 00:40.454
Now we're up
in the big leagues

00:40.592 --> 00:43.112
Gettin' our turn at bat

00:43.250 --> 00:45.562
As long as we live,
it's you and me, baby

00:45.700 --> 00:47.495
There ain't nothin' wrong
with that

00:47.633 --> 00:50.015
We're movin' on up
Movin' on up

00:50.153 --> 00:53.225
To the East Side
Movin' on up

00:53.363 --> 00:56.642
To a deluxe apartment
in the sky

00:57.816 --> 01:00.508
Movin' on up
Movin' on up

01:00.646 --> 01:03.132
To the East Side
Movin' on up

01:04.374 --> 01:07.308
We finally got
a piece of the pie

01:22.910 --> 01:24.429
Hey, how's it going, Florence?

01:25.775 --> 01:28.674
Florence?
I was just joking, Weezy.
I knew it was you.

01:28.812 --> 01:30.849
You better had.

01:30.987 --> 01:33.127
Look, I don't have to see
your face to recognize you.

01:33.265 --> 01:35.371
What you got back there
is one of a kind.

01:36.372 --> 01:37.959
Thank you, George.

01:38.443 --> 01:39.651
I think.

01:40.997 --> 01:43.033
Oh, what do we got here?
Let's see...

01:43.172 --> 01:45.139
Bill, bill, bill.

01:46.485 --> 01:47.624
Any calls?

01:47.762 --> 01:49.143
Well, I was out
most of the day.

01:49.281 --> 01:51.801
But if Florence took
any messages,
they'd be by the phone.

01:51.939 --> 01:53.527
Oh, yeah. Here's a couple.

01:53.665 --> 01:56.737
"Important message:
Don't forget to pay
your hard-working maid

01:56.875 --> 01:59.257
"the $50 bet
you lost to her last month.

02:00.430 --> 02:02.294
"Or you don't get
no more messages."

02:02.432 --> 02:04.262
I got a message for her.
Florence!

02:04.400 --> 02:07.127
She's not here.
I gave her the afternoon off
to go shopping.

02:07.265 --> 02:08.300
You what?

02:08.438 --> 02:10.578
Macy's is having
a monster sale.

02:10.716 --> 02:13.409
Huh. Maybe we'll get lucky
and somebody'll buy Florence.

02:18.310 --> 02:21.002
I can't read this one.
Here, let me try.

02:21.141 --> 02:24.040
How come Florence can only
write good when she's
asking for money?

02:24.178 --> 02:25.697
It says, "Mr. Jefferson,

02:26.456 --> 02:28.251
"Edie Stokes in town.

02:29.010 --> 02:30.736
"Marquis Hotel.

02:30.874 --> 02:33.153
"Room 516. Please call."

02:34.188 --> 02:35.569
Edie Stokes.
Who's Edie Stokes?

02:35.707 --> 02:37.502
That's what I'd like to know.

02:37.640 --> 02:39.538
I don't know
no Edie Stokes.

02:39.676 --> 02:42.231
Well, she knows you.
Give me that.

02:42.369 --> 02:45.165
Who is she?
A stranger. That's who she is.

02:45.303 --> 02:47.546
George, I want an answer.

02:47.684 --> 02:49.445
I got it! It's Florence.

02:49.583 --> 02:52.965
Florence?
Look, Florence can't write
and she can't spell neither.

02:53.103 --> 02:56.245
She left out a D.
It ain't Edie Stokes,
it's Eddie Stokes!

02:56.383 --> 02:57.729
Who's Eddie Stokes?

02:57.867 --> 03:01.077
You know, Eddie Stokes,
my old Navy buddy.

03:01.215 --> 03:03.321
How many times have I
told you about him?

03:03.459 --> 03:04.529
Never.

03:06.979 --> 03:09.223
There's a lot about the Navy
I never told you about.

03:10.120 --> 03:11.260
I'll bet.

03:11.398 --> 03:13.123
Me and Eddie did
everything together.

03:13.262 --> 03:15.436
Shoot, he slept on top of me
for two years.

03:17.266 --> 03:18.957
That must have been
uncomfortable.

03:20.130 --> 03:22.512
You know what I mean.
We were bunkmates.

03:22.650 --> 03:25.101
Oh, Eddie used to love to play
practical jokes on people.

03:25.239 --> 03:27.345
He was the master of
the "Gotcha!"

03:29.036 --> 03:30.865
What's a "Gotcha?"

03:31.003 --> 03:34.559
Well, for instance,
Eddie rig up a bucket of water
over the barracks door,

03:34.697 --> 03:36.457
and the next dude came in got
a big shower.

03:36.595 --> 03:37.700
That's a "Gotcha."

03:39.391 --> 03:40.841
He even got me once.

03:40.979 --> 03:43.499
But I got him back though.

03:43.637 --> 03:47.641
Oh, Eddie got so drunk
one night and we took him
down to this tattoo parlor.

03:47.779 --> 03:51.300
And had the name "Myrtle"
tattooed on his arm.

03:52.646 --> 03:54.061
Who's Myrtle?

03:54.199 --> 03:56.270
Myrtle was the chief's wife!

03:59.100 --> 04:01.448
Eddie had to wear long sleeves
for two years!

04:03.381 --> 04:05.245
That's a panic, George.

04:05.383 --> 04:07.454
No, that's a "Gotcha."

04:07.592 --> 04:09.835
Oh, Weezy, you'd love him.
What a guy.

04:09.973 --> 04:11.285
Uh, where are you going?

04:11.423 --> 04:13.322
I'm going down to the hotel.
I want to surprise Eddie.

04:13.460 --> 04:15.669
I can't believe it!
Old Eddie is in town.

04:15.807 --> 04:19.259
After 25 years,
it's Jefferson and Stokes
together again! Haha!

04:19.397 --> 04:22.227
And just when New York
was getting back on its feet.

04:26.335 --> 04:28.820
Who you callin' "boy"?
Haha! See you, Weezy.

04:46.734 --> 04:48.115
Gotcha!

04:52.499 --> 04:54.984
Excuse me. I thought this
was Eddie Stokes' room.

04:55.122 --> 04:56.572
It is.
It is?

04:56.710 --> 04:57.918
Oh, are you his wife?

04:58.056 --> 05:00.438
No.
Ah-ha-ha! Same old Eddie, huh?

05:00.576 --> 05:03.026
Where is he?
Well, you see...

05:03.164 --> 05:05.097
Oh, I got it. He don't want me
to know he's here

05:05.235 --> 05:08.308
so you're supposed to say
he ain't here, but he is here.
In there!

05:11.207 --> 05:12.242
Gotcha!

05:13.934 --> 05:14.935
Hunh.

05:19.146 --> 05:20.147
Got...

05:31.434 --> 05:33.574
Okay, Eddie, I know
you're in there.

05:33.712 --> 05:34.989
Come on, out of the closet.

05:35.127 --> 05:37.095
I'm already out of
the closet, George.

05:42.031 --> 05:43.412
Huh?

05:43.550 --> 05:46.207
It's me, Eddie.
Only I'm Edie now.

05:47.623 --> 05:48.693
Say what?

05:56.563 --> 05:58.047
Take a good look.

06:16.514 --> 06:19.448
Oh, you're still
the same old Eddie,
you ain't changed a bit.

06:21.208 --> 06:24.314
Wow, still the ace
number one joker, huh?
What a costume!

06:24.453 --> 06:26.040
You really had me fooled
this time.

06:26.178 --> 06:27.835
George, I think
I should explain.

06:27.973 --> 06:30.666
Come on, man,
get out of that crazy outfit.
Let's go have a drink.

06:30.804 --> 06:33.738
You can start by taking off
this dumb-looking wig.
Ow! It's real.

06:33.876 --> 06:35.395
You're jiving.
I'm not.

06:36.292 --> 06:38.259
George, what I'm trying
to say is...

06:39.433 --> 06:40.883
I've changed.

06:42.816 --> 06:45.612
What are you trying
to tell me, Eddie?
That you're a fairy?

06:46.682 --> 06:48.684
C'mon say it.
I can handle it.

06:48.822 --> 06:50.375
No, George. I'm not gay.

06:50.513 --> 06:53.102
Thank God! I don't think
I could've handled it.

06:54.414 --> 06:55.967
C'mon, I could really
use that drink.

06:56.105 --> 06:58.348
Look, I don't mind the hair,
but the dress has got to go.

06:58.487 --> 07:01.835
You get out of that
rented costume and
I'll pick you out a pair...

07:05.355 --> 07:08.324
Damn, Eddie, you went
all the way with this joke,
didn't ya?

07:09.601 --> 07:11.914
You rented all this stuff
just to fool me?

07:12.052 --> 07:14.019
Now, where are your clothes?

07:14.157 --> 07:15.814
Those are my clothes.

07:15.952 --> 07:18.886
Okay, Eddie,
whatever you say.

07:19.024 --> 07:21.095
What do you keep in here?
Your brassiere?

07:25.134 --> 07:26.687
Look, Eddie.

07:28.724 --> 07:30.829
Me and you used to be
best friends, right?

07:30.967 --> 07:32.590
We never had no secrets
from each other.

07:32.728 --> 07:35.731
You can tell me anything,
no matter how bad it is.
So tell me.

07:35.869 --> 07:38.596
Are you one of those guys
who likes to dress up
in woman's clothes?

07:38.734 --> 07:39.804
Are you one of them, uh...

07:39.942 --> 07:41.564
Transvestites?
Yeah. One of them.

07:41.702 --> 07:42.772
No.

07:42.910 --> 07:46.086
Good. 'Cause I can't stand
them weirdoes.

07:46.224 --> 07:49.607
Well, look, if you ain't
gay and you ain't a weirdo,
what are you?

07:49.745 --> 07:51.401
I had the operation.

07:53.921 --> 07:55.716
I had a sex change.

07:58.616 --> 08:00.445
George, I'm a woman now.

08:01.653 --> 08:02.620
Oh.

08:09.834 --> 08:11.594
Oh, Eddie.

08:11.732 --> 08:13.700
I'm not Eddie anymore,
I'm Edie.

08:14.666 --> 08:15.909
This ain't a "Gotcha"?

08:16.047 --> 08:17.876
This ain't a "Gotcha."

08:18.774 --> 08:20.223
Why, Eddie? Why'd you do it?

08:20.361 --> 08:22.018
I wish you'd call me Edie.

08:22.156 --> 08:23.882
I can't!

08:24.020 --> 08:26.989
Look, underneath all
that make up and that dress,
you're still Eddie.

08:27.127 --> 08:28.991
I know he's in there
somewhere.

08:30.717 --> 08:33.167
Look, you don't understand,
George. I'm a woman.

08:33.305 --> 08:35.342
Deep down inside,
I've always been a woman.

08:35.480 --> 08:37.896
Even in the Navy?
Even in the Navy.

08:38.034 --> 08:41.659
Uh, now you tell me.
After you let me undress
in front of you for two years.

08:43.315 --> 08:46.042
Now, George,
this isn't something
that happened overnight.

08:46.180 --> 08:48.873
I went through years
of analysis,
but that didn't help.

08:49.011 --> 08:50.702
As a man, I was miserable.

08:50.840 --> 08:53.049
Everything about me was
a woman except the way
I looked.

08:53.187 --> 08:54.948
So, I had the operation.

08:55.086 --> 08:57.295
Oh, Eddie, look what
you've done to yourself!

08:57.433 --> 09:01.333
Now, George, I understand
where you're coming from.

09:01.471 --> 09:04.129
It's hard for people
to accept what I've done.

09:04.267 --> 09:06.269
Most of my old
friends couldn't.

09:06.925 --> 09:09.203
So now I have new friends.

09:09.341 --> 09:13.000
I have a job I enjoy,
a place of my own.
I feel good about myself.

09:13.138 --> 09:16.590
George, for the first time
in my life, I'm really happy.

09:17.695 --> 09:19.662
Yeah, I'm thrilled too.

09:21.664 --> 09:24.011
George, I have
a confession to make.

09:24.149 --> 09:25.668
What was that you just made?

09:27.083 --> 09:29.430
Look, George, I wasn't
even going to call you.

09:29.569 --> 09:33.503
I've been in New York
six days. I'm flying home
to Ohio tonight.

09:33.642 --> 09:36.610
It took me all this time to
get up the courage
to call you,

09:37.059 --> 09:38.578
my old buddy.

09:40.062 --> 09:43.306
It's important to me that
you at least understand.

09:44.825 --> 09:46.516
I understand.

09:46.655 --> 09:49.865
Oh, good. Now,
let's go have that drink
you were talking about.

09:53.178 --> 09:54.317
Look at the time.

09:56.803 --> 09:59.391
I didn't know it was so late.
I forgot, I got
an important meeting.

09:59.529 --> 10:01.980
What kind of meeting
can't wait for one drink
between old friends?

10:02.118 --> 10:04.155
Alcoholics Anonymous.

10:05.777 --> 10:08.159
Good seeing you again.
Hey, hold that elevator.

10:11.334 --> 10:12.542
Yeah, George.

10:13.405 --> 10:15.097
You take care of yourself.

10:24.451 --> 10:27.799
Hi, Mrs. Jefferson.
Hello, Florence.
How was the sale?

10:27.937 --> 10:29.698
Child, it was a madhouse.

10:30.768 --> 10:33.115
Folks screaming,
and pushing, and kicking.

10:33.253 --> 10:35.427
Kicking? That's terrible!

10:35.565 --> 10:37.360
Yeah, I almost broke my toe.

10:43.539 --> 10:44.885
Where's Mr. Jefferson?

10:45.023 --> 10:47.577
I'm really gonna need that
$50 he owes me now.

10:47.716 --> 10:51.133
Oh, he's out with
an old friend. You know,
the one who called before.

10:51.271 --> 10:53.307
Yeah, who is she anyway?

10:53.445 --> 10:57.553
It's not a "she," Florence.
It's Eddie Stokes, a friend
of George's from the Navy.

10:58.416 --> 10:59.624
Navy?

11:00.970 --> 11:04.664
If Mr. Jefferson's friend was
in the Navy, she was a WAVE.

11:07.080 --> 11:09.703
Florence, that's impossible.

11:09.841 --> 11:12.982
Why would George tell me
he's going to a hotel
to meet a man

11:13.120 --> 11:15.088
when he's really going to meet
a woman?

11:20.162 --> 11:21.750
I better get to work.

11:21.888 --> 11:25.270
Wait a minute, I'll show you
that you are wrong.

11:25.408 --> 11:27.825
Why can't you admit that
you just made a mistake?

11:32.036 --> 11:36.626
I mean, a voice on
the telephone can fool you.
Lots of men have high voices.

11:36.765 --> 11:40.630
Hello, I would like to know
if you have a Mr. Eddie Stokes

11:40.769 --> 11:42.632
registered in Room 516?

11:44.531 --> 11:46.533
I'm not a sir, I'm a madam!

11:51.469 --> 11:53.057
Oh, that's all right.

11:53.195 --> 11:54.714
You see what I mean?

11:55.611 --> 11:56.612
Yes?

11:57.406 --> 11:58.787
You don't?

11:58.925 --> 12:00.305
Are you sure? Because...

12:02.791 --> 12:04.758
Oh, I see.

12:05.863 --> 12:07.519
Miss Edith Stokes.

12:21.879 --> 12:24.744
How could I have been
so stupid?

12:24.882 --> 12:28.471
Why that no-good, miserable,
little, little...

12:28.955 --> 12:30.266
Runt?
Runt!

12:33.131 --> 12:36.756
Oh, Florence.
My little runt is out
with another woman.

12:38.102 --> 12:40.035
I'll kill him!

12:40.173 --> 12:41.761
Now wait a minute,
Mrs. Jefferson.

12:41.899 --> 12:44.833
I'm sure Mr. Jefferson's
got a good explanation.

12:44.971 --> 12:46.558
Are you sure?
Yeah.

12:46.696 --> 12:49.561
Even when he does
something wrong,
he's got a good explanation.

12:53.496 --> 12:55.257
Hi, Weez.

12:55.395 --> 12:58.156
George, I didn't expect you
home so soon.

12:59.399 --> 13:01.056
Did you have a good time?

13:01.194 --> 13:03.713
Huh? Oh, yeah. Sure.

13:07.027 --> 13:08.442
What are you looking at?

13:10.168 --> 13:11.549
Nothing much.

13:14.069 --> 13:17.727
Florence, I'd appreciate it
if you'd put something
in the kitchen for me.

13:17.866 --> 13:19.453
What?
Your mouth!

13:22.491 --> 13:25.011
Where's Eddie? Why didn't you
bring him home?

13:25.149 --> 13:28.462
What? Oh, uh, he had to
catch a plane tonight.

13:28.980 --> 13:30.395
Oh, that's a pity.

13:30.533 --> 13:33.502
I was looking forward to
meeting your old bunkmate.

13:34.572 --> 13:36.539
Well, you can't 'cause
he's gone.

13:39.025 --> 13:40.336
How is he?
Who?

13:40.785 --> 13:41.786
Eddie.

13:43.684 --> 13:45.341
He's, uh, changed.

13:48.724 --> 13:50.208
He's older?

13:51.106 --> 13:52.590
Yeah, that too.

13:58.078 --> 14:00.253
What the hell is this?
"Follow the leader"?

14:03.083 --> 14:05.914
I'd just like to hear more
about Eddie.

14:06.052 --> 14:08.192
Look, I went to the hotel
to see my friend.

14:08.330 --> 14:11.954
I saw him. I said, "Hello."
Then I said, "Goodbye."
Then I left. Okay?

14:12.092 --> 14:14.129
George, I called the hotel.

14:14.267 --> 14:17.891
And the desk clerk told me.
There was an Edith Stokes
in room 516.

14:18.650 --> 14:20.618
So stop lying to me, George!

14:20.756 --> 14:23.069
Where were you tonight
and who were you with?

14:24.277 --> 14:25.519
Okay, Weezy,

14:25.657 --> 14:28.074
if you really wanna
know the truth, I'll tell you.

14:30.421 --> 14:33.079
My old buddy Eddie had
a sex change operation.

14:34.080 --> 14:35.253
Ooh-wee!

14:38.325 --> 14:40.293
Now that's a good one,
Mr. Jefferson.

14:44.469 --> 14:46.368
That's the best one
you've ever told.

14:48.232 --> 14:51.891
Weezy...
Don't touch me,
you no-good two-timer!

14:52.029 --> 14:53.616
Okay, I'll prove it to you.

14:55.964 --> 14:57.827
Who you calling?
The hotel.

14:57.966 --> 15:00.589
I'm gonna have Eddie
come over here and you can see
with your own eyes that I...

15:00.727 --> 15:02.522
Hello? Uh, yeah,
you can help me.

15:02.660 --> 15:05.076
Would you gimme room 516,
please?

15:05.214 --> 15:07.251
You better be ready
to apologize, Weezy.

15:08.528 --> 15:09.701
Yeah, I'm here.

15:10.461 --> 15:12.152
What? When?

15:14.844 --> 15:15.949
Thank you.

15:19.297 --> 15:20.885
Eddie checked out
five minutes ago.

15:21.023 --> 15:22.783
Oh, that's okay, George.

15:22.922 --> 15:25.234
I stopped believing you
ten minutes ago.

15:27.202 --> 15:30.136
Oh, where are you off to now?
Another reunion?

15:30.274 --> 15:33.277
His plane don't leave for
another three hours.
I'm going over to the hotel.

15:33.415 --> 15:36.038
Maybe he's in the bar,
the restaurant, someplace.
I'll find him.

15:36.176 --> 15:39.110
If you don't, see if her room
is still available.

15:39.628 --> 15:41.216
For what?

15:41.354 --> 15:44.426
Because if you come back
alone, you're not sleeping
in this house tonight!

15:44.564 --> 15:47.429
You just wait here.
I'll be back
and I'll be back with him!

15:47.567 --> 15:49.741
With her!
Him, her, it, whatever!

15:57.473 --> 15:58.854
It's okay. C'mon.

16:17.079 --> 16:20.945
Mr. Jefferson, I don't think
this is gonna work.

16:25.087 --> 16:26.088
Look.

16:27.883 --> 16:30.161
Don't worry about it, Leroy.

16:30.299 --> 16:32.439
My wife has never
seen you before.

16:32.577 --> 16:35.132
Just do like I said
and everything'll be fine.

16:35.270 --> 16:37.341
I still wish you'd gotten
somebody else.

16:40.137 --> 16:42.622
Look, I couldn't find
anybody else!

16:42.760 --> 16:44.658
All the girls at the store
had gone home.

16:44.796 --> 16:47.075
And you were the only guy left
who didn't have a moustache.

16:47.213 --> 16:48.524
Yeah, but...

16:48.662 --> 16:50.561
Look, I told my wife
I'd be home with Eddie,

16:50.699 --> 16:53.150
I couldn't find Eddie,
so you're it.

16:53.288 --> 16:55.393
And besides, you said
you wanted to be an actor.

16:55.531 --> 16:57.085
Yeah, an actor.

16:58.051 --> 16:59.501
Not an actress.

17:02.021 --> 17:05.058
How do you think
Flip Wilson got started?

17:05.196 --> 17:07.267
And don't forget,
I'm paying you $50
to do this.

17:07.405 --> 17:09.028
Which I ain't seen yet.

17:09.787 --> 17:10.788
Here.

17:24.043 --> 17:27.149
Now, let's go over this
one more time.
What's your name?

17:27.287 --> 17:28.633
Leroy.
No, you idiot!

17:30.670 --> 17:32.292
Your name is Eddie Stokes!

17:32.430 --> 17:35.088
We were in the Navy together
during the Korean War.

17:35.226 --> 17:38.885
You're catching a plane home
tonight to Ohio so you can
only stay a few minutes.

17:39.023 --> 17:40.197
You get it?
Yeah.

17:40.749 --> 17:42.337
Okay. Now, let's go.

17:46.375 --> 17:48.998
Weezy! Weezy, I got
a surprise for you.

17:51.000 --> 17:52.347
I found Eddie.

17:55.315 --> 17:56.282
Look!

18:11.055 --> 18:14.231
Oh, so, uh, this is Eddie.

18:14.369 --> 18:16.233
That's right,
my old bosom buddy.

18:17.820 --> 18:19.753
Eddie, uh,
this is my wife, Louise.

18:20.271 --> 18:21.755
How do you do?

18:30.592 --> 18:33.353
Ever since the operation,
his voice can't
make up its mind.

18:33.491 --> 18:34.803
Well, let's go.

18:34.941 --> 18:37.116
But, George,
you just got here.

18:37.254 --> 18:39.394
Uh, Eddie hates long goodbyes.

18:39.532 --> 18:42.086
Oh, Eddie,
I just love your outfit.

18:43.501 --> 18:45.848
Why, thank you,
Mrs. Jefferson.

18:48.127 --> 18:49.818
Uh, you know, Eddie,

18:51.785 --> 18:54.547
George has told me
so much about you.

18:55.893 --> 18:59.966
Oh, did he tell you
we were in the Navy together?

19:01.623 --> 19:05.420
That's right. Me and Eddie
fought side-by-side
all through the Korean War.

19:06.386 --> 19:09.493
How interesting.
Tell me more, Eddie.

19:10.252 --> 19:11.874
That's all I know.

19:14.325 --> 19:16.603
That operation affected
his memory, too.

19:18.053 --> 19:19.123
Hello.

19:19.779 --> 19:21.229
Hello.

19:26.924 --> 19:28.891
I mean, hello!

19:33.793 --> 19:35.001
What's that?

19:37.245 --> 19:38.556
That's Eddie.

19:39.454 --> 19:41.007
Lord.

19:41.145 --> 19:42.974
Come on, Eddie.
You're gonna miss your plane.

19:43.112 --> 19:48.980
Oh, yes. I'm rushing to catch
a plane home to Ohio tonight.

19:50.672 --> 19:53.813
Oh? Where in Ohio do you live?

19:53.951 --> 19:55.366
Cleveland.
Cincinnati.

19:55.918 --> 19:57.506
He's moving.

19:57.644 --> 19:59.577
You better start moving too,
George.

20:00.268 --> 20:01.510
Say what?

20:01.648 --> 20:04.479
Did you really think
this cheap trick was
gonna fool me?

20:04.617 --> 20:06.170
Nope.

20:07.067 --> 20:08.552
I told you it wouldn't work.

20:08.690 --> 20:11.762
Oh, Leroy, you're the one
that blew it! Come on!

20:11.900 --> 20:13.626
Hey, hold it.
Gimme back my $50.

20:17.561 --> 20:20.391
Thank you, Mr. Jefferson.
This is the $50
you owe me.

20:20.529 --> 20:21.944
Now we're even.

20:22.082 --> 20:23.705
Hey, wait a minute, Florence,
come back here with my money.

20:23.843 --> 20:25.983
George, this time
you have gone too far!

20:26.121 --> 20:28.779
I've had it with your lies!
Weezy, I'm telling you
the truth.

20:28.917 --> 20:30.815
There really is
an Eddie Stokes.

20:30.953 --> 20:33.680
I just couldn't find
the real one, that's all.
You gotta believe me!

20:33.818 --> 20:35.579
Why should I?

20:35.717 --> 20:38.202
First, you tell me
you're going to meet a man
who turns out to be a woman.

20:38.340 --> 20:39.686
That's right.

20:39.824 --> 20:41.895
And then you bring
some fool up here
wearing women's clothes

20:42.033 --> 20:44.104
and tell me it's your friend.

20:44.243 --> 20:48.316
And now you say there really
is an Eddie Stokes and you
expect me to believe you?

20:48.454 --> 20:49.627
Yeah.

20:49.765 --> 20:51.146
Well, forget it.

20:51.284 --> 20:53.976
And pack up your bags
'cause you're not
staying here tonight.

20:54.114 --> 20:55.599
Now, hold it!

20:55.737 --> 20:58.257
This is my house,
I pay the rent.
I ain't going nowhere!

21:00.500 --> 21:04.021
Okay, if that's the way
you want it, I'll leave.

21:05.264 --> 21:06.334
Weezy...

21:08.612 --> 21:10.061
Go away.

21:11.097 --> 21:12.754
Eddie!
What are you doing here?

21:12.892 --> 21:14.549
Well, I forgot one of
my bags at the hotel,

21:14.687 --> 21:16.827
went back for it,
got your message,
and rushed right over.

21:16.965 --> 21:19.139
Eddie, old buddy, old pal!
Oh, Weezy, Weezy!

21:19.278 --> 21:22.281
What's wrong, George?
Your message said it was
a matter of life and death.

21:22.419 --> 21:24.938
It is! You are gonna
save my life!

21:25.076 --> 21:27.665
George, my mind is made up.
I'm packing.

21:27.803 --> 21:29.805
Well, you can just start
by unpacking,
'cause this is Eddie.

21:29.943 --> 21:31.013
The real Eddie.

21:31.151 --> 21:32.532
Edie.
Whatever.

21:33.844 --> 21:36.087
What do you say now, Weezy?

21:36.225 --> 21:38.952
Well, George,
at least this time,
you were smart enough

21:39.090 --> 21:41.369
to hire a woman to play
the part.

21:41.507 --> 21:43.509
This ain't no woman.
I beg your pardon.

21:45.234 --> 21:48.237
Weezy, remember I told you
about the time we got
Eddie stone drunk

21:48.376 --> 21:50.516
and we took him to
this tattoo parlor
and got him tattooed?

21:50.654 --> 21:51.758
Well, here it is.

21:52.863 --> 21:54.658
Where's Myrtle?

21:54.796 --> 21:56.763
Where is it?
It's gotta be here somewhere.
Where'd it go?

21:56.901 --> 21:58.420
I had the tattoo removed,
George.

21:58.558 --> 21:59.801
You what?

21:59.939 --> 22:02.597
It just didn't go
with high heels
and a beaded purse.

22:05.082 --> 22:07.187
That's it! Goodbye, George!

22:07.326 --> 22:10.467
Weezy, wait. Listen,
I swear this is really Eddie!

22:10.605 --> 22:13.746
Well, I hope you
and Eddie will be very
happy together!

22:15.264 --> 22:18.026
I love you
and I miss you,
my fuzzy wuzzy teddy bear.

22:20.062 --> 22:21.581
What did you say?

22:21.719 --> 22:25.585
I said, "I love you
and I miss you, my fuzzy
wuzzy teddy bear."

22:25.723 --> 22:29.037
Isn't that the way you ended
all of your letters to George,
when he was in the Navy?

22:29.175 --> 22:32.558
No, it ain't! Weezy used
to call me her
"big, strong grizzly bear."

22:34.353 --> 22:37.183
No, I distinctly remember
"fuzzy wuzzy teddy bear."

22:37.321 --> 22:39.496
It was grizzly bear!
Teddy bear.

22:39.634 --> 22:41.912
Look, she's my wife.
I ought to know what
she used to call me!

22:42.050 --> 22:43.845
It was grizzly bear!

22:43.983 --> 22:46.019
No, George. She's right.

22:46.157 --> 22:48.919
You were my fuzzy wuzzy
teddy bear.
I was?

22:52.509 --> 22:55.546
And if you know that,
you must be the real Eddie.

22:56.961 --> 22:58.618
Edie.
Oh, I mean Edie.

22:59.895 --> 23:01.966
Thank god we got all
that cleared up!

23:02.967 --> 23:04.797
Well, I've got a plane
to catch.

23:04.935 --> 23:06.488
Oh, look Eddie, uh,

23:06.626 --> 23:09.905
I just wanted to apologize
for the way I acted back
at the hotel tonight.

23:10.043 --> 23:11.769
That's all right,
I understand.

23:11.907 --> 23:14.531
You saved my marriage,
I'll never forget it.

23:14.669 --> 23:16.636
What are friends for?

23:16.774 --> 23:19.570
Hey, that's right.
We are still friends, Eddie.

23:19.708 --> 23:23.022
George, as a friend,
I wish you'd call me Edie.

23:24.057 --> 23:25.473
Okay, sure. Uh...

23:26.232 --> 23:27.233
Edie.

23:28.337 --> 23:30.892
Thanks, George.
I appreciate that.

23:31.030 --> 23:33.515
Hey, uh, why don't you
let us take you
to the airport?

23:33.653 --> 23:35.137
Thank you. I'd like that.

23:35.275 --> 23:36.898
Uh, would you mind
if I use your bathroom?

23:37.036 --> 23:38.658
I'd like to freshen up
before we leave.

23:38.796 --> 23:40.246
Oh, sure, it's right in there.

23:40.384 --> 23:42.524
Oh, okay.

23:42.662 --> 23:44.733
Well, what do you
say now, Weez?

23:44.871 --> 23:46.597
George, how could you?

23:46.735 --> 23:48.254
What did I do?

23:48.392 --> 23:52.016
You read my love letters
to the entire
United States Navy!

23:52.154 --> 23:54.881
No I didn't, Weezy.
Just to Eddie.
He was my buddy.

23:55.813 --> 23:58.195
Well, that's all right then.

23:58.333 --> 24:01.647
I should've believed you.
I'm sorry. Forgive me?

24:02.268 --> 24:04.166
I'll think about it.

24:04.304 --> 24:06.617
Okay, I thought about it.
I forgive you.

24:08.757 --> 24:10.172
George,

24:10.310 --> 24:13.486
you know you are still
my fuzzy wuzzy teddy bear.

24:14.280 --> 24:16.109
You know something, Weezy?

24:16.247 --> 24:19.527
I'm going to miss
the old Eddie. We used to
have a lot of laughs together.

24:19.665 --> 24:21.287
I remember this time...

24:21.425 --> 24:24.014
EDIE: George! There's
a big rat in the bathroom!

24:24.152 --> 24:25.153
A rat? Here?

24:30.883 --> 24:31.849
Gotcha!

24:58.531 --> 25:02.155
LOUISE: The Jeffersons
was videotaped in front of
a studio audience.
