12:06.051 --> 12:08.051
You think I want to see
a negro man swing

12:08.053 --> 12:09.552
for something he didn't do?

12:09.554 --> 12:11.054
I killed white men,
protecting you!

12:11.056 --> 12:12.922
You killed rebel soldiers,

12:12.924 --> 12:14.724
and that was
to protect yourself!

12:14.726 --> 12:16.226
No. I killed
my own people

12:16.228 --> 12:17.694
during the riots,
protecting yours!

12:17.696 --> 12:19.195
You're Irish, to the
pit of your heart,

12:19.197 --> 12:20.697
and you Irish know how to hate!

12:20.699 --> 12:22.599
Oh, I hate, all right,
but not in general.

12:22.601 --> 12:25.335
My hate is as specific
as my affections.

12:27.771 --> 12:28.972
And you, Matthew,
need only look

12:28.974 --> 12:30.540
at the woman in your bed
to know the Irish

12:30.542 --> 12:32.575
hold no patent
on a brooding heart.

12:41.051 --> 12:42.886
Hyah! Ha!

13:03.447 --> 13:05.116
Herr Schwarz.

13:05.430 --> 13:07.096
Herr Schwarz, may I
see that locket?

13:07.098 --> 13:08.264
Yeah.

13:11.936 --> 13:13.269
This one?

13:13.271 --> 13:14.504
This one.

13:23.581 --> 13:25.882
Justice!

13:25.884 --> 13:29.552
I demand justice for
my dear, dead father!

13:29.554 --> 13:31.588
What are the coppers doing
to find papa's killer?

13:31.590 --> 13:34.123
Nothing!

13:34.125 --> 13:35.925
Why have they imprisoned his
best friend, Gerry Crotty?

13:35.927 --> 13:37.227
Yeah!

13:37.229 --> 13:38.595
I'll tell you why --

13:38.597 --> 13:40.763
to cover over the truth!

13:40.765 --> 13:43.233
Papa was brutally murdered
by that nigger, Garland!

13:43.235 --> 13:46.035
I say we find Garland

13:46.037 --> 13:47.370
and lynch him!

13:47.372 --> 13:48.404
Yeah!

13:48.406 --> 13:49.706
Garland is guilty!

13:49.708 --> 13:51.307
Yeah!
Who's with me?

13:51.309 --> 13:53.910
Who's with me?

13:53.912 --> 13:55.411
How the Christ did
Kayleigh O’Connor

13:55.413 --> 13:57.046
find out about Garland?

13:57.048 --> 13:58.881
I'm sure I don't know, cap'n.

13:58.883 --> 14:00.149
Byrnes: The crowd
out there

14:00.151 --> 14:01.784
is ripe for a lynching.

14:01.786 --> 14:03.353
And I'll have to let Crotty

14:03.355 --> 14:05.154
out of the tombs, eventually.

14:05.156 --> 14:06.889
He'll stoke the fire.

14:06.891 --> 14:09.158
I'll talk to Tammany,
get him a job

14:09.160 --> 14:10.960
or some money,
and shut him out.

14:10.962 --> 14:12.428
I barely know Crotty,
but, trust me,

14:12.430 --> 14:13.930
the man can't shut up.

14:13.932 --> 14:15.431
The only way around this is

14:15.433 --> 14:17.767
to hang Garland now,
without a trial.

14:17.769 --> 14:19.335
Cap'n,

14:19.337 --> 14:20.903
I'm not sure, yet,
if Garland's guilty.

14:20.905 --> 14:22.405
I am sure that
O’Connor was killed

14:22.407 --> 14:24.407
with a long, thin needle.

14:24.409 --> 14:26.843
More of your
scientific nonsense?

14:26.845 --> 14:28.678
Let me prove Garland's
guilt before we hang him.

14:28.680 --> 14:30.046
Let me go to his house
and find the evidence.

14:41.225 --> 14:44.060
[ Laughs ]

14:44.062 --> 14:45.662
Is that the mayor's son?

14:45.664 --> 14:46.996
Yes.

14:46.998 --> 14:49.732
Come slumming it.

14:49.734 --> 14:53.002
Left us a souvenir.

14:53.004 --> 14:56.072
Huh.

14:56.074 --> 15:01.044
Mighty kind of him.

15:01.046 --> 15:02.779
What's this?

15:02.781 --> 15:05.114
Oh, this.

15:05.116 --> 15:08.318
This is a surprise for Corky.

15:08.320 --> 15:09.852
Give it to me.

15:09.854 --> 15:11.087
[Laughing]
No!

15:11.089 --> 15:12.588
Give it to me at once.

15:12.590 --> 15:14.390
I paid Herr Schwarz
$7 for this --

15:14.392 --> 15:15.625
Ah!

15:15.627 --> 15:18.127
[Tearfully] And I don't
want you telling Kevin

15:18.129 --> 15:19.495
that you've seen the locket.

15:19.497 --> 15:21.998
I won't. I won't,
if you say --

15:22.000 --> 15:24.000
Did Schwarz say
who pawned this?

15:24.002 --> 15:28.304
I didn't think to ask.

15:28.306 --> 15:30.406
Go back to work.

15:30.408 --> 15:32.375
Yeah --
Go back to work!

15:36.447 --> 15:37.447
Molly?

15:37.449 --> 15:39.615
Hi, handsome.
Yeah, I'm Molly.

15:46.357 --> 15:48.124
O’Brien: The sooner
we noose Garland,

15:48.126 --> 15:49.759
the sooner everyone
will calm down.

15:49.761 --> 15:51.260
Andrew, did you mention
Garland's name

15:51.262 --> 15:52.762
to Kayleigh O’Connor,
or anyone?

15:52.764 --> 15:54.197
No! Not even
my wife.

15:54.199 --> 15:55.298
Francis?

15:55.300 --> 15:56.833
No, Kevin, I wouldn't.

15:56.835 --> 15:59.202
Keep looking.
We need proof.

15:59.204 --> 16:02.138
It's a waste of time.

16:02.140 --> 16:03.639
Not if he didn't do the deed.

16:03.641 --> 16:05.641
He did!
It's clear as day.

16:05.643 --> 16:10.880
It's not that clear,
but, yeah, he did.

16:22.659 --> 16:25.661
Matthew, what are you
doing here?

16:25.663 --> 16:28.564
Trying to convince
Rev Garland to confess.

16:28.566 --> 16:30.066
To his innocence.

16:30.068 --> 16:32.535
God brought me to this place,

16:32.537 --> 16:34.971
in this time, for a reason.

16:34.973 --> 16:37.206
Well, guess what,
reverend -- I went

16:37.208 --> 16:38.908
to your private
quarters for a reason,

16:38.910 --> 16:41.310
and God let me find this.

16:41.312 --> 16:43.012
This is blood.

16:43.014 --> 16:46.249
Ox blood.

16:46.251 --> 16:48.718
We wrap the meat
to keep the flies away.

16:48.720 --> 16:50.486
We like to give
the children meat

16:50.488 --> 16:54.190
at least once a month.

16:54.192 --> 16:55.758
He's innocent, Kevin.

16:55.760 --> 16:59.829
Even if he doesn't
seem to want to be.

16:59.831 --> 17:01.230
Shh!

17:01.232 --> 17:03.800
Let's not wake Sara.

17:03.802 --> 17:05.334
[Scoff]
So your wife,

17:05.336 --> 17:07.837
she actually does sleep?

17:07.839 --> 17:09.972
One eye at a time.

17:09.973 --> 17:11.473
Hey, that's evidence.

17:11.476 --> 17:12.974
You'll have plenty left over.

17:23.686 --> 17:25.755
Compare.

17:25.757 --> 17:27.089
Smell.

17:31.962 --> 17:33.496
Different?

17:33.498 --> 17:34.730
Same.

17:34.732 --> 17:36.966
And this?

17:36.968 --> 17:38.201
And this?

17:38.203 --> 17:39.735
They're both the same.
Freeman, I --

17:39.737 --> 17:41.571
And this?

17:43.207 --> 17:45.308
And this.

17:45.310 --> 17:46.809
Oh! That
smells awful.

17:46.811 --> 17:48.311
Human blood has
a different stench

17:48.313 --> 17:49.745
than animal blood,
when treated with

17:49.747 --> 17:51.714
acidum sulphuricum.

17:51.716 --> 17:54.083
The first three, pig;
Next one, goat;

17:54.085 --> 17:56.819
that's Garland's rag;
and that's human.

17:56.821 --> 17:58.888
How do I know
that's human blood?

17:58.890 --> 18:01.757
You don't believe me?

18:01.759 --> 18:03.326
Give me your wrist.

18:03.328 --> 18:04.827
Stop. Your little
demonstration

18:04.829 --> 18:06.329
doesn't prove
Garland's innocent.

18:06.331 --> 18:10.166
Well, it proves that
this rag isn't evidence.

18:10.168 --> 18:12.034
You still have
no case, detective.

18:16.773 --> 18:18.407
Hello, pet.

18:25.983 --> 18:29.852
Sorry I'm so --

18:29.854 --> 18:31.988
What's wrong?

18:31.990 --> 18:33.856
Eva's a bitch.

18:33.858 --> 18:37.493
Tare An'ouns,
what'd she do now?

18:37.495 --> 18:41.197
Hmm?

18:41.199 --> 18:44.233
I went down to
Schwarz's pawnshop

18:44.235 --> 18:48.170
and I found a --

18:48.172 --> 18:49.639
Never mind.

18:49.641 --> 18:56.078
Just hold me.

18:56.080 --> 18:57.580
[Pounds cane ]
All right!

18:57.582 --> 19:00.416
Everybody, give me
your attention.

19:00.418 --> 19:03.119
If you should happen
to come across

19:03.121 --> 19:05.121
a distinctive gold locket,

19:05.123 --> 19:07.823
engraved with the letters
E and C on its face.

19:07.825 --> 19:09.325
It might have pictures

19:09.327 --> 19:12.228
of a man and a little
girl on the inside.

19:12.230 --> 19:14.430
O’Brien: Corky!

19:14.432 --> 19:16.432
A coachman delivered
this for you.

19:16.434 --> 19:18.434
From the smell of it,

19:18.436 --> 19:20.202
it's nothing criminal.

19:20.204 --> 19:21.904
[Sniff] At least, not yet.

19:26.577 --> 19:28.110
What are you looking
at, you scum?

19:30.147 --> 19:31.614
Sorry I couldn't be
here any earlier.

19:31.616 --> 19:33.182
I'm working on a case.

19:33.184 --> 19:34.951
I understand.

19:34.953 --> 19:37.219
Please, take a seat.

19:45.996 --> 19:49.365
Um, I have a favor to ask.

19:49.367 --> 19:51.400
Well, that's fortunate.

19:51.402 --> 19:53.302
I brought you here to ask
a favor of my own.

19:53.304 --> 19:56.138
Next time,

19:56.140 --> 19:58.207
could you ease up
on the rosewater?

19:58.209 --> 19:59.675
I will not hear the end of it

19:59.677 --> 20:01.877
at the precinct house.

20:01.879 --> 20:05.114
Embarrassing you
was not my intention.

20:05.116 --> 20:07.016
It's just the way I smell.

20:14.157 --> 20:18.427
Sits well on the wall,
does she not?

20:18.429 --> 20:22.865
Yes, she does.

20:22.867 --> 20:25.668
You have a favor to ask?

20:25.670 --> 20:30.973
Yes.

20:30.975 --> 20:35.011
Um,

20:35.013 --> 20:37.580
you have arrested Rev Garland,

20:37.582 --> 20:40.082
a kind and holy man.

20:40.084 --> 20:41.584
His orphanage means
quite a lot to me.

20:41.586 --> 20:43.586
I trust he will receive

20:43.588 --> 20:45.021
fair and proper treatment.

20:45.023 --> 20:46.522
I'll make sure he does.

20:48.925 --> 20:50.226
Det Corcoran,

20:50.228 --> 20:54.196
you are never what I expect.

20:54.198 --> 20:57.299
Never.

20:57.301 --> 20:59.635
I'm sorry.

21:00.332 --> 21:01.832
For I forgot to take your hand

21:01.834 --> 21:04.067
at the door again.

21:04.069 --> 21:05.569
Annie:
I can't sleep.

21:05.571 --> 21:08.505
I keep hearing voices.

21:08.507 --> 21:10.807
Men's voices.

21:24.048 --> 21:28.218
Thank you, James.

21:28.220 --> 21:29.719
Is he here yet?

21:29.721 --> 21:32.488
Yes, sir. He arrived
moments ago.

21:32.490 --> 21:35.592
Excellent.

21:35.594 --> 21:38.695
Det Maguire.

21:38.697 --> 21:40.196
Thank you for coming.

21:40.198 --> 21:41.698
Did I keep you waiting?

21:41.700 --> 21:43.399
The train from Albany
is unreliable.

21:43.401 --> 21:45.134
No, I was --

21:45.136 --> 21:46.736
I see James has
taken care of you.

21:46.738 --> 21:50.506
Oh! Cold, for
September, isn't it?

21:50.508 --> 21:51.507
Aye.

21:51.509 --> 21:52.508
Anything?

21:52.510 --> 21:54.844
Nothing,
Mr. Morehouse.

21:54.846 --> 21:56.312
To business, then.

21:56.314 --> 21:57.847
I'm told the owner
of the stables

21:57.849 --> 21:59.482
on Baxter street has died.

21:59.484 --> 22:02.151
Diarmuid O’Connor.
Murdered.

22:02.153 --> 22:04.153
A tragedy, I'm sure.

22:04.155 --> 22:05.755
I'm told you and he
were friends.

22:05.757 --> 22:08.024
Acquaintances, really.

22:08.026 --> 22:09.525
He has an heir,
a daughter. Assuming

22:09.527 --> 22:12.061
she could use the money,
I'd like to buy the stables.

22:12.063 --> 22:14.063
Sir, they're
a lousy investment.

22:14.065 --> 22:15.565
Stable's
half-burned.

22:15.567 --> 22:17.567
I'm well aware.

22:17.569 --> 22:20.370
I would like you, detective,

22:20.372 --> 22:21.738
to handle the matter.

22:21.740 --> 22:24.540
I don't want to run a stable.

22:24.542 --> 22:28.111
No. You wouldn't
have to.

22:28.113 --> 22:30.580
You'd simply hold the deed

22:30.582 --> 22:32.782
until such time as I ask you

22:32.784 --> 22:34.484
to sign the property
over to me.

22:36.420 --> 22:41.057
Meanwhile --
[Rings bell]

22:41.059 --> 22:42.759
This transaction
remains between us.

22:42.761 --> 22:45.194
You will tell
no one -- no one --

22:45.196 --> 22:47.030
not even Det Corcoran.

22:47.032 --> 22:49.899
There will be
a proper commission,

22:49.901 --> 22:51.367
of course.

22:51.369 --> 22:53.703
All right.

23:02.680 --> 23:05.982
Tare An'ouns.

23:05.984 --> 23:07.617
Now, if you'll excuse me,

23:07.619 --> 23:11.120
I'm tired after my long trip.

23:11.122 --> 23:12.588
Goodnight.

23:27.137 --> 23:28.638
What the hell just happened?

23:28.640 --> 23:30.406
Welcome to the world
of high finance.

23:36.580 --> 23:39.082
Crotty: You've got
no right to keep me,

23:39.084 --> 23:40.550
to treat me like a slave.

23:40.552 --> 23:43.119
I need to eat, to
wash under my arms.

23:43.121 --> 23:45.621
Nah.

23:45.623 --> 23:48.992
I know what O’Connor
did to you.

23:48.994 --> 23:50.960
You do?
Mm-hmm.

23:50.962 --> 23:54.897
How -- how did you
find out?

23:54.899 --> 23:58.434
I'm a detective.
It's what I do.

23:58.436 --> 23:59.936
So I understand

23:59.938 --> 24:01.437
why you would want
O’Connor dead.

Oh, I didn't say
you killed him,

Maybe the others involved

The others?
There was only her.

No! Never.

to the point

where she had to kill him.

24:25.997 --> 24:28.331
I tell you, no.

as Diarmuid could be,

a pretty good idea.

36:09.911 --> 36:11.410
stopped facing the
gallows in this city.

36:11.412 --> 36:13.112
Easier said than done.

36:13.114 --> 36:16.081
What the reverend
lacks is an alibi.

36:16.083 --> 36:18.184
Don't you recall, Corky?

36:18.186 --> 36:20.519
I was with Garland
at the time of the murder,

36:20.521 --> 36:24.190
offering money
to the orphans' asylum.

36:24.192 --> 36:26.926
And, having been in Albany,

36:26.928 --> 36:28.427
I've only just heard
the accusations.

36:28.429 --> 36:30.196
That's right.

36:30.198 --> 36:31.363
I'd forgotten.

36:31.365 --> 36:33.766
Unfortunately,

36:33.768 --> 36:35.267
that still leaves you
one murderer short.

36:35.269 --> 36:37.369
I've figured a way

36:37.371 --> 36:39.705
around that, too.

36:39.707 --> 36:41.307
Sullivan:
According to

36:41.309 --> 36:42.741
the findings
at St. Vincent's,

36:42.743 --> 36:45.277
your father hung himself.

36:45.279 --> 36:47.279
Suicide?

36:47.281 --> 36:49.348
That's simply not true.

36:49.350 --> 36:50.849
This isn't about the truth,

36:50.851 --> 36:52.484
it's about resolution.

36:52.486 --> 36:57.189
Kayleigh, your father
was dying of cancer.

36:57.191 --> 36:59.592
He didn't want you to
have to look after him,

36:59.594 --> 37:01.093
so he took his own life.

37:01.095 --> 37:02.661
But suicides can't remain
buried in sacred ground.

37:02.663 --> 37:05.231
Corcoran:
Father Burke said that,

37:05.233 --> 37:07.099
since the body's
already in the grave,

37:07.101 --> 37:08.601
there's no reason
to disturb the bones.

37:08.603 --> 37:12.605
It's time to let
the past go, Kayleigh.

37:12.607 --> 37:15.074
Get on with the rest
of your life.

37:15.076 --> 37:17.009
Marriage.

37:17.011 --> 37:19.078
You'll let Gerry
out of the tombs?

37:19.080 --> 37:20.646
How will we live?

37:20.648 --> 37:23.215
Before he died, Diarmuid and I

37:23.217 --> 37:25.384
made a deal for me
to buy the stables.

37:25.386 --> 37:27.119
Corcoran: You,

37:27.121 --> 37:28.621
buy the stables?

37:28.623 --> 37:29.855
An investment.

37:29.857 --> 37:33.092
We can use the space
for boxing matches.

37:33.094 --> 37:35.127
You and Gerry can move up to

37:35.129 --> 37:37.763
Greenwich village.

37:39.699 --> 37:43.269
All right.

37:43.271 --> 37:46.739
God bless my dear father.

37:50.277 --> 37:51.877
Woman: Gerry!

37:51.879 --> 37:55.214
Where are you going, Gerry?!

37:57.150 --> 37:58.651
You're getting married,

37:58.653 --> 38:00.619
you're getting a new house,

38:00.621 --> 38:02.121
and you're keeping
your mouth shut.

38:02.123 --> 38:03.355
Can you do that for me, Gerry?

38:03.357 --> 38:06.091
Ah, yeah.

38:06.093 --> 38:07.926
If there's troubles,

38:07.928 --> 38:10.663
I'll first come banging
on your door.

38:10.665 --> 38:14.033
Daniel, he was a good man

38:14.035 --> 38:16.902
he prayed three times a day

38:16.904 --> 38:21.507
the angels opened up
the windows

38:21.509 --> 38:25.577
just to hear
what Daniel had to say

38:25.579 --> 38:28.847
Daniel, he was a good man

38:28.849 --> 38:32.484
he prayed three times a day

38:32.486 --> 38:34.253
"Oh, I thank God"

38:34.255 --> 38:36.355
"I'm in his care"

38:45.098 --> 38:47.266
watch your step, ma'am.

38:50.036 --> 38:51.537
I'm reading
Mr. Dickens's

38:51.539 --> 38:55.908
latest novel,
"Our Mutual Friend."

38:55.910 --> 38:58.344
The hero's not unlike
you, Kevin Corcoran.

39:02.015 --> 39:04.216
For all you have done,

39:04.218 --> 39:05.884
I am most grateful.

39:26.539 --> 39:27.773
Freeman: Sara!

39:31.111 --> 39:32.611
Jasper's going to stay
with us for a while,

39:32.613 --> 39:34.680
if that's okay.

39:34.682 --> 39:39.885
He can be here when
I'm off, doing my rounds.

39:39.887 --> 39:41.220
You hungry?

39:41.222 --> 39:43.288
All the time.

39:48.294 --> 39:50.062
Come over here, then.

40:05.412 --> 40:07.012
Here, now, I'll trade you.

40:14.220 --> 40:17.055
[ Rapid knocking ]

40:17.057 --> 40:19.691
Madame Grindle?

40:19.693 --> 40:23.262
Madame Grindle.

40:23.264 --> 40:25.130
Julia, it's Eva.

40:37.477 --> 40:39.945
She'll rot in hell, this one.

40:39.947 --> 40:42.047
She performed a service.

40:42.049 --> 40:44.450
An illegal service, godless.

40:44.452 --> 40:46.251
Who killed her?

40:46.253 --> 40:48.454
That's the question.

40:52.459 --> 40:53.959
You all right?

40:53.961 --> 40:55.594
[ Scoff ]

40:55.596 --> 40:57.863
It's not the first
dead body I've seen.

40:57.865 --> 41:02.000
I've got to ask,
um -- [Gulp]

41:02.002 --> 41:05.137
Why are you...
Here?

41:05.139 --> 41:06.538
[Chuckling] Oh,

41:06.540 --> 41:10.309
one of my girls,
she's with child.

41:10.311 --> 41:12.244
Well, I guess you're
lucky there are

41:12.246 --> 41:14.279
more Madame Grindles
in the world.

41:30.697 --> 41:33.732
Elizabeth?

41:33.734 --> 41:35.267
Elizabeth?

41:35.269 --> 41:39.538
Kevin.

41:39.540 --> 41:42.241
I had to see you.

41:42.243 --> 41:45.444
I can't stop thinking
about the night --

41:45.446 --> 41:47.880
The night we were together?

41:47.882 --> 41:49.381
We were never together.

41:49.383 --> 41:51.617
The night

41:51.619 --> 41:53.785
we killed Winfred Haverford.

41:53.787 --> 41:56.622
I never felt such
powerful sensations.

41:56.624 --> 41:58.190
And I know you feel them, too,

41:58.192 --> 42:00.058
towards me.

42:00.060 --> 42:01.760
Annie!

42:01.762 --> 42:04.329
I don't want you like that.

42:04.331 --> 42:07.299
I never did.

42:09.435 --> 42:11.403
You don't need
to offer yourself

42:11.405 --> 42:14.873
to men anymore, sweetheart.

42:16.321 --> 42:18.655
Understand?

42:20.180 --> 42:21.513
Go upstairs

42:21.515 --> 42:23.015
and put your clothes on, child.

42:35.194 --> 42:37.996
Get everything
you wanted, Annie?

42:45.371 --> 42:47.573
Don't you ever
bring her here again.

42:47.575 --> 42:49.408
Or what, detective?

42:49.410 --> 42:51.712
Or else I'll stick this
pistol up your arse.

43:00.653 --> 43:03.288
Kevin, I'm sorry.

43:03.290 --> 43:05.257
Truly sorry.

43:05.259 --> 43:06.858
God bless you, child.
