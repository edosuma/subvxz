WEBVTT

00:08.200 --> 00:11.328
- DUDE, DO YOU KNOW THEY MAKE
SILENT WINDOW SHADES?

00:11.370 --> 00:13.429
SOME WOMAN IN WASHINGTON
INVENTED THEM

00:13.480 --> 00:14.606
BACK IN THE EARLY '905.

00:14.640 --> 00:16.642
- SINCE WHEN IS THE SOUND OF
OPENING AND CLOSING SHADES

00:16.680 --> 00:18.568
SO DISRUPTIVE THAT IT
HAS TO BE ALLEVIATED?

00:18.610 --> 00:19.440
- WHY DO YOU
HAVE TO HATE ON

00:19.480 --> 00:21.311
OTHER PEOPLES
TRIUMPHS OF INNOVATION?

00:21.350 --> 00:22.419
- WEIRD.

00:22.450 --> 00:23.417
- IT'S NOT WEIRD;
IT'S SELFISH

00:23.450 --> 00:24.348
AND MORE THAN
A LITTLE PE'I'I'Y.

00:24.390 --> 00:25.288
- NO, NOT THAT,
COME TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

00:25.320 --> 00:28.380
- MAN, THIS BE'I'I'ER NOT BE
ANOTHER AUCTION

00:28.420 --> 00:30.422
FOR ONE OF
STONEY JACKSON'S NECKERCHIEFS.

00:30.460 --> 00:31.757
- IT'S NOT, SHAWN.

00:31.790 --> 00:33.223
THIS CAME IN
ON THE PSYCH ACCOUNT.

00:33.260 --> 00:35.228
THE SENDER IS
ME@UNDERTHENAIL.COM

00:35.260 --> 00:37.490
I'M PRETI'Y SURE
IT'S NOT SPAM.

00:37.530 --> 00:39.191
- WELL, WHAT'S THE ATTACHMENT?

00:39.240 --> 00:41.162
CINNAMON FESTIVAL.

00:41.200 --> 00:42.030
- THE GREAT NORTHERN.

00:42.070 --> 00:43.264
I'M NOT FAMILIAR
WITH THAT PUBLICATION.

00:43.310 --> 00:45.505
- WHAT, YOU KNOW EVERY SMALL
TOWN NEWSPAPER IN CALIFORNIA?

00:45.540 --> 00:46.768
- ACTUALLY, I DO, SHAWN.

00:46.810 --> 00:48.232
- RIDGECREST?
- THE DAILY INDEPENDENT.

00:48.280 --> 00:49.577
- SHAWNOPOLIS.
- THAT DOESN'T EXIST.

00:49.610 --> 00:50.770
- YET.

00:50.810 --> 00:52.846
I JUST NEED 50,000 SIGNATURES
AND A LARGE PLOT OF LAND.

00:52.880 --> 00:56.247
WELL, LOOK UP THIS TOWN,
DUAL SPIRES.

00:56.290 --> 00:57.416
I MEAN, HOW CAN THERE BE
A CINNAMON FESTIVAL

00:57.450 --> 00:58.781
THAT WE'VE
NEVER HEARD OF?

00:58.820 --> 01:00.856
ZOOM IN.

01:00.890 --> 01:03.154
ZOOM IN MORE.

01:03.190 --> 01:05.385
KEEP ZOOMING.
- I AM, SHAWN.

01:05.430 --> 01:10.265
DUDE, THIS TOWN IS SO SMALL
THAT IT'S IN PARENTHESIS.

01:10.300 --> 01:11.619
HOW THE HECK
DID WE GET THIS EMAIL?

01:11.670 --> 01:13.228
- IT'S A DELICIOUS MYSTERY.

01:13.270 --> 01:15.238
THINK ABOUT IT,
A TINY LITI'LE TOWN

01:15.270 --> 01:16.737
WE'VE NEVER
EVEN HEARD OF?

01:16.770 --> 01:18.260
WHAT'S YOUR
SCHEDULE LOOK LIKE?

01:18.310 --> 01:19.504
- I'M OPEN TILL
MY ROUTE TOMORROW.

01:19.540 --> 01:20.677
- LET'S SEE HERE.

01:20.710 --> 01:21.699
- YOU THINK THEY'LL
HAVE MONKEY BREAD?

01:21.740 --> 01:23.139
- YES, I DO.
- WHAT?

01:23.180 --> 01:25.808
- I'M GOOD TILL
NEXT WRESTLEMANIA.

01:39.930 --> 01:41.557
- A HALF MILE
FROM THE NEAREST ROAD?

01:41.600 --> 01:45.866
NO WONDER
IT'S IN PARENTHESIS.

01:45.900 --> 01:48.232
THAT IS ONE SECLUDED TOWN.

01:53.910 --> 01:56.708
- LET'S GET SOME CINNAMON.

01:59.250 --> 02:00.547
WELL, EVERYONE LOOKS SO HAPPY,

02:00.580 --> 02:04.414
AND YET,
SO PERPLEXED.

02:04.450 --> 02:05.849
- SOMETHING'S OFF
ABOUT THIS PLACE, SHAWN.

02:05.890 --> 02:07.312
PEOPLE KEEP LOOKING,

02:07.360 --> 02:08.418
LIKE I'M THE FIRST BLACK MAN
THEY'VE SEEN.

02:08.460 --> 02:11.725
- COME ON, GUS.
DON'T BE ABSURD.

02:11.760 --> 02:15.696
- HEY MISTER,
ARE YOU FREDERICK DOUGLASS?

02:15.730 --> 02:17.869
- SHAWN, WE NEED
TO GET OUT OF HERE.

02:19.970 --> 02:23.167
- NAH, LET'S GET
SOMETHING TO EAT.

02:29.580 --> 02:32.549
[soft pop music plays]

02:32.580 --> 02:34.946
*

02:34.980 --> 02:36.845
- HEY, TOP OF THE MORNING
TO YOU, BOYS.

02:36.890 --> 02:38.710
ROBERT BARKER.
YOU CAN CALL ME BOB.

02:38.750 --> 02:40.559
JUST PASSING THROUGH?

02:40.590 --> 02:41.784
- WE'RE HERE
FOR THE FESTIVAL.

02:41.820 --> 02:43.720
WE TAKE OUR CINNAMON
VERY SERIOUSLY.

02:43.760 --> 02:45.751
- WELL, THEN YOU'RE IN LUCK,
BECAUSE SO DO WE.

02:45.790 --> 02:47.291
90 YEARS RUNNING.

02:47.330 --> 02:48.888
- WHY DO YOU CALL YOUR DINER
THE SAWMILL?

02:48.930 --> 02:50.329
- 'CAUSE THAT'S
WHAT IT USED TO BE.

02:50.370 --> 02:52.531
MOST OF IT BURNED DOWN
BACK IN '58.

02:52.570 --> 02:53.867
GRANDDAD TURNED IT
INTO THIS PLACE,

02:53.900 --> 02:55.834
AND NOW IT'S JUST
A BIT OF A LOCAL LANDMARK.

02:55.870 --> 02:57.531
- WE JUST NEED
A LITTLE SOMETHING

02:57.570 --> 02:59.276
TO HOLD US OVER
UNTIL SHOWTIME,

02:59.310 --> 03:00.470
SO, UH,
WHAT'S GOOD?

03:00.510 --> 03:02.341
- HOW ABOUT A CUP

03:02.380 --> 03:04.541
OF THE BEST
PIPIN' HOT APPLE CIDER

03:04.580 --> 03:06.309
THIS SIDE
OF THE MISSISSIPPI,

03:06.350 --> 03:10.184
AND A SLICE OF CINNAMON PIE
THAT MAY JUST BRING TEARS?

03:11.320 --> 03:14.653
TWO SLICES
OF CINNAMON PIE, HON.

03:14.690 --> 03:17.250
THAT'S THE WIFE.
ISN'T SHE A PEACH?

03:17.290 --> 03:19.599
AH, I'LL GET THAT CIDER.
[laughing]

03:19.630 --> 03:21.393
- BOB'S A REAL CHATTY CATHY.
- YOU THINK?

03:21.430 --> 03:22.727
- YOU SHOULD
CHECK YOUR EMAIL.

03:22.770 --> 03:24.920
SEE IF OUR SECRET PAL SENT US
ANY CINNAMON COMPS.

03:24.970 --> 03:28.531
- I'M AFRAID YOU WON'T HAVE MUCH
LUCK WITH THOSE HERE.

03:28.570 --> 03:30.401
SHERIFF ANDREW JACKSON.

03:30.440 --> 03:32.670
YOU KNOW,
WE HAD THE OPPORTUNITY

03:32.710 --> 03:34.530
TO PUT UP
SOME OF THOSE FANCY TOWERS,

03:34.580 --> 03:39.540
BUT FOLKS DECIDED A BASIC
LANDLINE WAS FINE WITH THEM.

03:39.580 --> 03:40.740
I COULDN'T HELP
BUT OVERHEAR

03:40.780 --> 03:43.715
THAT YOU'RE IN TOWN
FOR THE FESTIVAL.

03:43.750 --> 03:45.786
IT'S RARE
TO GET VISITORS.

03:45.820 --> 03:51.258
- WELL, WE HEARD ALL ABOUT IT
ON UNDERTHENAIL.COM.

03:51.290 --> 03:55.727
- WE DON'T HAVE THE INTERNET
IN DUAL SPIRES.

03:55.760 --> 03:58.524
IT'S SIMPLER THAT WAY.
- HMM.

03:58.570 --> 03:59.935
- DUDE, WE'RE DOING WITNESS.
- THEY WERE AMISH.

03:59.970 --> 04:01.494
- NOT DANNY GLOVER,
HE WAS BLACK.

04:01.540 --> 04:02.859
- WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

04:02.910 --> 04:06.539
- WELL, WE ARE HAPPY YOU ARE
HERE, NEVERTHELESS.

04:06.580 --> 04:08.707
IT SHOULD BE A HECK
OF A CELEBRATION.

04:08.740 --> 04:11.846
- TWO SLICES OF CINNAMON PIE.
- THANK YOU.

04:15.420 --> 04:17.809
- WELL, WE'LL SEE YOU
AT THE FESTIVAL.

04:17.850 --> 04:20.717
- SHERIFF.

04:24.090 --> 04:26.524
WHAT'S THE VERDICT?

04:26.560 --> 04:28.391
REALLY?

04:28.430 --> 04:29.761
- MMM.

04:29.800 --> 04:30.824
- OH, MOTHER OF GOD.

04:30.870 --> 04:31.825
- MM.

04:31.870 --> 04:33.895
- MM-HMM.
- MM.

04:39.070 --> 04:41.538
- DUDE, THAT OWL IS MADE
ENTIRELY OF CINNAMON.

04:41.580 --> 04:44.447
- WHICH MEANS THAT IT IS
BOTH WISE AND DELICIOUS.

04:44.480 --> 04:46.914
- LET'S HAVE A NICE,
WARM ROUND OF APPLAUSE

04:46.950 --> 04:48.941
FOR MAYOR DOUGLAS FIR.

04:53.460 --> 04:55.587
THIS YEAR'S FESTIVAL MASCOT:

04:55.620 --> 04:59.750
LEO, THE CINNAMON OWL.

04:59.800 --> 05:02.428
- YOU FOUND THE MONKEY BREAD.
- YOU KNOW THAT'S RIGHT.

05:02.470 --> 05:05.098
- AND NOW, THE MOMENT I KNOW
YOU'VE ALL BEEN WAITING FOR.

05:05.130 --> 05:09.669
IT'S TIME TO ANNOUNCE THIS
YEAR'S CINNAMON KING.

05:09.710 --> 05:11.359
WHOOOO WILL IT BE?

05:11.410 --> 05:14.470
all: [imitating an owl]
WHO, WHO?

05:14.510 --> 05:15.579
- OH, WHO ARE WE KIDDING?

05:15.610 --> 05:16.975
PUT YOUR
HANDS TOGETHER

05:17.010 --> 05:18.944
FOR THE FUTURE LEADER
OF DUAL SPIRES.

05:18.980 --> 05:21.813
A YOUNG MAN THAT
NEEDS NO INTRODUCTION,

05:21.850 --> 05:25.445
COME UP AND
CLAIM YOUR CROWN, RANDY.

05:30.130 --> 05:32.655
- THAT'S MY BOY.

05:34.400 --> 05:36.960
- WHAT'S 24 TIMES 12?

05:37.000 --> 05:38.490
- 288.
WHY?

05:42.000 --> 05:44.366
- THERE'S A CHAIR HERE
FOR EVERY PERSON IN TOWN.

05:44.410 --> 05:45.832
THREE ARE EMPTY.

05:45.870 --> 05:47.701
SHERIFF'S TALKING,
SO THAT'S ONE.

05:47.740 --> 05:48.968
CHECK IT OUT.

05:49.010 --> 05:50.875
THERE'S ONE
RIGHT NEXT TO THE BARKERS.

05:57.690 --> 06:00.386
- HEY.
HEY, YOU FOUND THE MONKEY BREAD.

06:00.420 --> 06:01.887
- YEAH.

06:01.920 --> 06:04.127
MRS. BARKER,
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

06:04.160 --> 06:06.958
- NO.
EVERYTHING IS NOT OKAY.

06:07.000 --> 06:09.468
- SHELLEY.
- WHAT?

06:09.500 --> 06:12.094
I CAN'T JUST SIT HERE
AND PRETEND TO BE EXCITED

06:12.130 --> 06:16.430
ABOUT CHURROS
AND LEO THE CINNAMON OWL.

06:16.470 --> 06:18.631
- I SENSE
SOMEONE IS MISSING.

06:18.670 --> 06:21.571
- YEAH.
OUR NIECE, PAULA.

06:21.610 --> 06:23.498
SHE'S BEEN GONE
ABOUT A DAY AND A HALF.

06:23.550 --> 06:26.178
EVERYONE KEEPS
TELLING US NOT TO PANIC.

06:26.210 --> 06:27.575
SHE'S A TEENAGER.

06:27.620 --> 06:30.839
- WAIT, WHAT DID YOU MEAN,
YOU SENSED IT?

06:30.890 --> 06:33.108
- MR. AND MRS. BARKER,
I HAVE A CONFESSION TO MAKE.

06:33.160 --> 06:35.185
I'M NOT JUST
A CINNAMON ENTHUSIAST.

06:35.220 --> 06:37.120
I'M ALSO
A PSYCHIC DETECTIVE.

06:37.160 --> 06:41.153
AND THIS IS MY PARTNER,
LODGE BLACKMUNN.

06:41.200 --> 06:42.599
- CAN YOU FIND PAULA?

06:42.630 --> 06:44.962
- PERHAPS.
OH!

06:45.000 --> 06:48.936
I GOT A LITTLE SOMETHING
UNDER THE NAIL.

06:48.970 --> 06:51.768
RIGHT HERE, UNDER--
UNDER THE NAIL.

06:51.810 --> 06:53.573
[whispering]
IT'S NOT HER.

06:53.610 --> 06:54.702
- WE ARE AVAILABLE FOR HIRE.

06:54.740 --> 06:56.605
- WE DON'T HAVE MUCH MONEY.

06:56.650 --> 06:57.947
NONE OF US DO, HERE.

06:57.980 --> 06:59.777
WE BELIEVE
IT COMPLICATES THINGS.

06:59.820 --> 07:00.912
- WELL, WE HAVE BEEN KNOWN

07:00.950 --> 07:02.918
TO WORK FOR CIDER OR PIE
IN THE PAST.

07:02.950 --> 07:05.544
- OH, OF COURSE.
AS MUCH AS YOU'D LIKE.

07:05.590 --> 07:07.057
- WE WILL
FIND YOUR NIECE.

07:07.090 --> 07:09.650
- THANK YOU.
- THANK YOU.

07:09.690 --> 07:12.955
- WHO IS SUPPOSED TO BE
SITTING OVER THERE?

07:13.000 --> 07:15.855
- OH, THAT'S
PAULA'S BEST FRIEND, JACK.

07:15.900 --> 07:19.734
I'M NOT SURE
WHERE HE IS.

07:19.770 --> 07:22.603
- WOULD THIS BE--

07:24.170 --> 07:26.058
- SOMETHING HAPPENED
AT THE LAKE.

07:26.110 --> 07:28.601
SOMETHING HAPPENED
AT THE LAKE!

07:31.580 --> 07:33.810
- IT'S PAULA.

07:33.850 --> 07:35.841
I KNOW IT IS.

07:35.880 --> 07:37.586
OH, GOD.

07:37.620 --> 07:43.126
[sobbing]

07:57.940 --> 08:00.829
- JACK DISCOVERED HER
JUST ABOUT AN HOUR AGO, DOC.

08:00.880 --> 08:03.872
- SO YOUNG.

08:03.910 --> 08:06.913
MY GOD, ANDREW.

08:16.630 --> 08:18.120
- JACK, IS THIS
HOW YOU FOUND HER?

08:18.160 --> 08:21.288
- NO, SIR.
SHE WAS HALF NAKED.

08:21.330 --> 08:22.866
IT WASN'T RIGHT.

08:22.900 --> 08:24.720
I DIDN'T WANT PEOPLE
TO SEE HER LIKE THAT.

08:24.770 --> 08:26.192
I'M SORRY.

08:28.170 --> 08:32.163
- OH, NOW I'VE GOT TO LET
THE BARKERS THROUGH.

08:36.650 --> 08:39.278
- NO!

08:39.310 --> 08:41.540
[crying]

08:41.580 --> 08:45.038
NO, MY BABY.

08:48.360 --> 08:49.918
- PAULA.

08:51.960 --> 08:54.758
[crying]
PAULA!

09:02.240 --> 09:04.561
[wails]

09:08.310 --> 09:10.676
- COME ON, DUDE.

09:10.710 --> 09:12.746
- YOU KNOW I'M
A SYMPATHETIC CRIER, SHAWN.

09:12.780 --> 09:16.887
JUST LEAVE ME BE.

09:16.920 --> 09:19.115
- DUDE,
I HAVE A BAR.

09:19.150 --> 09:21.653
AND AN EMAIL.

09:23.760 --> 09:28.857
GUS, WE WEREN'T CALLED HERE
FOR A CINNAMON FESTIVAL.

09:28.900 --> 09:31.164
- [whimpers]

09:32.870 --> 09:35.839
[haunted, dramatic music]

09:35.870 --> 09:38.839
*

09:38.870 --> 09:41.270
- * IN BETWEEN THE LINES

09:41.310 --> 09:45.201
* THERE'S A LOT
OF OBSCURITY *

09:45.250 --> 09:47.047
* I'M NOT INCLINED

09:47.080 --> 09:52.245
* TO RESIGN TO MATURITY

09:52.290 --> 09:54.884
* IF IT'S ALL RIGHT

09:54.920 --> 09:57.957
* THEN YOU'RE ALL WRONG

09:57.990 --> 10:04.293
* WHY BOUNCE AROUND
TO THE SAME DAMN SONG? *

10:04.330 --> 10:09.029
* YOU'D RATHER RUN

10:09.070 --> 10:15.634
* WHEN YOU CAN'T CRAWL

10:15.680 --> 10:17.875
*

10:17.910 --> 10:24.383
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

10:24.420 --> 10:29.312
* I KNOW YOU KNOW

10:36.400 --> 10:37.958
- I'M GUESSING
THE TIME OF DEATH WAS

10:38.000 --> 10:39.888
SOMETIME
NIGHT BEFORE LAST.

10:39.940 --> 10:42.261
DOC GOODEN WILL DO
A FULL AUTOPSY.

10:42.300 --> 10:43.938
YOU KNOW SHE WON'T
MISS A THING, BOB.

10:43.970 --> 10:47.007
BUT I SUSPECT
WHAT WE WILL FIND

10:47.040 --> 10:49.270
IS THAT PAULA
WENT SWIMMING AFTER CURFEW,

10:49.310 --> 10:51.175
LIKE SHE ALWAYS DID,

10:51.210 --> 10:52.939
AND GOT PULLED UNDER
BY THE CURRENT

10:52.980 --> 10:54.117
AND HIT HER HEAD.

10:54.150 --> 10:57.119
I'M GONNA RULE IT
AN ACCIDENT FOR NOW.

10:57.150 --> 11:00.313
- SHE MUST HAVE SNUCK OUT.

11:00.360 --> 11:03.420
- BOB, WE BOTH KNOW
SHE'S BEEN SNEAKING OUT

11:03.460 --> 11:06.429
JUST ABOUT EVERY NIGHT
SINCE SHE GOT HERE.

11:06.460 --> 11:09.258
LISTEN, WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE MICHELLE ON HOME.

11:09.300 --> 11:12.121
SHE'S GONNA NEED YOU
TO BE STRONG NOW.

11:12.170 --> 11:16.231
I'LL GET DEPUTY FROST TO
TAKE YOU BACK IN THE RICKSHAW.

11:16.270 --> 11:19.262
I'M SO, SO SORRY, BOB.

11:24.050 --> 11:27.417
- LOOKS LIKE WE WON'T BE NEEDING
YOUR SERVICES AFTER ALL, BOYS.

11:27.450 --> 11:28.519
- MR. BARKER, I AM SENSING

11:28.550 --> 11:30.780
THERE IS MORE TO PAULA'S DEATH
THAN MEETS THE EYE.

11:30.820 --> 11:32.447
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

11:32.490 --> 11:35.050
THAT SHE--

11:35.090 --> 11:36.079
OH, MY GOD.

11:36.120 --> 11:37.121
- WE'D LIKE TO STICK AROUND.

11:37.160 --> 11:38.787
SEE WHAT WE SEE.

11:38.830 --> 11:40.149
FEEL WHAT WE FEEL.

11:40.200 --> 11:42.020
- OKAY.

11:42.060 --> 11:43.220
IF SOMEONE HURT PAULA,

11:43.270 --> 11:44.794
WE SURE AS HELL
WANT TO KNOW ABOUT IT.

11:44.830 --> 11:46.491
- I'M ALSO SENSING THAT PAULA
DIDN'T GROW UP HERE

11:46.530 --> 11:47.497
IN DUAL SPIRES.

11:47.540 --> 11:49.360
MAY I ASK WHERE
SHE WAS BEFORE?

11:49.400 --> 11:51.903
- PAULA LIVED IN SANTA BARBARA
TILL SHE WAS 11.

11:51.940 --> 11:53.373
- WELL, YOU HAVE
OUR CONDOLENCES,

11:53.410 --> 11:54.479
AND WE WILL BE IN TOUCH.

11:57.910 --> 11:59.241
- I THINK YOUR RIDE
IS HERE.

12:05.250 --> 12:09.209
- THE EARTH
IS SOFT AND MOIST.

12:15.830 --> 12:17.229
- WOW.

12:18.830 --> 12:21.196
- THAT IS SO BIZARRE.

12:21.240 --> 12:24.300
IT'S LIKE I ONLY HAVE
RECEPTION IN THIS SPOT.

12:34.520 --> 12:37.341
- IN ALL MY YEARS
OF POLICE WORK,

12:37.390 --> 12:39.017
I'VE NEVER SEEN
ANYTHING LIKE IT.

12:39.050 --> 12:40.415
- I KNOW.

12:40.460 --> 12:43.486
OUR NEW STATION MANAGER
IS AN ANGEL SENT FROM HEAVEN.

12:43.530 --> 12:45.953
[cell phone ringing]

12:45.990 --> 12:47.355
- O'HARA.

12:47.400 --> 12:48.822
- YES, DETECTIVE O'HARA.

12:48.860 --> 12:49.758
SHAWN SPENCER CALLING.

12:49.800 --> 12:51.324
- DID YOU JUST USE
BOTH OF OUR LAST NAMES?

12:51.370 --> 12:52.394
DON'T BE WEIRD.

12:52.430 --> 12:54.796
- OKAY, MISS O'HARA.

12:54.840 --> 12:56.865
DETECTIVE.
- SHAWN.

12:56.910 --> 12:57.865
- LOOK,
I'M REALLY STRUGGLING

12:57.910 --> 12:59.332
WITH THE
WHOLE WORK FORMAL THING.

12:59.370 --> 13:01.031
WHAT ARE YOU WEARING?

13:01.080 --> 13:02.900
- OKAY, YOU JUST TOOK IT FROM
ONE AWKWARD EXTREME TO ANOTHER.

13:02.950 --> 13:03.939
- I NEED YOU TO RUN A NAME

13:03.980 --> 13:04.947
FOR A GIRL.

13:04.980 --> 13:05.947
USED TO LIVE
IN SANTA BARBARA.

13:05.980 --> 13:07.242
PAULA MERRAL.
TWO "R"S.

13:07.280 --> 13:08.816
- SURE, IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

13:08.850 --> 13:10.078
- YEAH, ABSOLUTELY.

13:10.120 --> 13:11.348
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
CALL YOU BACK, THOUGH,

13:11.390 --> 13:13.085
'CAUSE THERE'S NOT REALLY
RECEPTION UP HERE.

13:13.120 --> 13:14.917
- UP WHERE?

13:14.960 --> 13:15.984
[electronic tones]
- HELLO?

13:16.020 --> 13:17.328
JULES.

13:17.360 --> 13:18.588
- SHAWN?

13:18.630 --> 13:22.225
- WOW, IT REALLY IS
JUST THE ONE SPOT.

13:22.260 --> 13:23.158
- YOUR CONVERSATIONS
WITH JULIET

13:23.200 --> 13:24.428
ARE TOO UNCOMFORTABLE
TO LISTEN TO NOW.

13:24.470 --> 13:26.165
I'M CALLING NEXT TIME.
- FINE.

13:26.200 --> 13:27.235
LOOK, IF WE'RE
GOING TO ACCOMPLISH

13:27.270 --> 13:28.498
ANYTHING IN THIS TOWN,

13:28.540 --> 13:29.939
WE ARE GONNA
NEED WHEELS.

13:33.410 --> 13:36.106
- SHAWN, WE HAVE REACHED
A NEW LOW POINT IN OUR LIFE.

13:36.140 --> 13:37.971
- ARE YOU KIDDING ME?
IT'S LIKE DRIVING MISS DAISY.

13:38.010 --> 13:39.307
EXCEPT YOU
GET TO BE MISS DAISY.

13:39.350 --> 13:43.286
- I DON'T WANT TO BE
IN THE MOVIE, SHAWN.

13:43.320 --> 13:45.311
LOOKS LIKE THE DOCTOR
STAYS PRETTY BUSY.

13:54.430 --> 13:59.959
- GOOD JOB SAVING
YOUR RECEIPTS, PATRICK.

14:00.000 --> 14:01.490
MAY I HELP YOU, GENTLEMEN?

14:01.540 --> 14:02.939
- HELLO, DOC GOODEN.

14:02.970 --> 14:03.902
MY PARTNER,
PLUS TOO MUCH

14:03.940 --> 14:06.306
CINNAMON MONKEY BREAD
EQUALS TUMMY SHAME.

14:06.340 --> 14:07.637
CAN YOU HELP US?

14:07.680 --> 14:09.944
- I'LL SEE HIM
AFTER MY NEXT PATIENT.

14:09.980 --> 14:13.609
[bird chirps, squawks]

14:13.650 --> 14:15.538
- [groaning]

14:15.580 --> 14:18.083
- DOC, THIS COULD
GET UGLY FAST.

14:18.120 --> 14:19.951
- ALL RIGHT.

14:30.970 --> 14:32.289
- SHERIFF JACKSON
MENTIONED WE HAD

14:32.330 --> 14:34.969
A COUPLE OF VISITORS
IN TOWN TODAY.

14:35.000 --> 14:37.662
YOU ARE AWARE THE CINNAMON
FESTIVAL HAS BEEN CANCELLED.

14:37.710 --> 14:39.029
- OH, YES.

14:39.070 --> 14:41.630
WE HEARD THERE WAS
SOME SORT OF TRAGEDY.

14:41.680 --> 14:44.205
MUST BE SO DIFFICULT

14:44.250 --> 14:47.242
IN A SMALL, HAPPY TOWN
LIKE DUAL SPIRES.

14:47.280 --> 14:50.113
- PUT THIS ON AND THEN LAY
FACE DOWN ON MY TABLE.

14:50.150 --> 14:53.017
- UH, WELL YOU KNOW--AH, AAH!

14:53.060 --> 14:54.084
ACTUALLY, I THINK--

14:54.120 --> 14:56.156
- SNAP TO IT.

14:56.190 --> 15:01.548
both: [hushed whispers]

15:01.600 --> 15:06.094
- SO HOW WELL DID YOU
KNOW THE GIRL?

15:06.130 --> 15:08.564
I'M SORRY,
I DON'T KNOW WHY I DO THAT.

15:08.600 --> 15:13.003
I CAN JUST SENSE THAT
YOU HAVE A HEAW HEART.

15:13.040 --> 15:14.974
- I'M A WOMAN OF SCIENCE.

15:15.010 --> 15:16.102
AND LAW.

15:16.140 --> 15:18.108
AND ACCOUNTING.

15:18.150 --> 15:21.074
BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT I DON'T FEEL.

15:21.120 --> 15:23.008
PAULA WAS
A TROUBLED YOUNG GIRL.

15:23.050 --> 15:25.541
I WISH I COULD HAVE
DONE MORE TO HELP HER.

15:25.590 --> 15:28.013
- YOU WERE HER PSYCHIATRIST?

15:28.060 --> 15:29.459
- YOU ASK A LOT OF QUESTIONS.

15:29.490 --> 15:32.653
- IT'S JUST--I RECENTLY
LOST SOMEONE MYSELF.

15:32.690 --> 15:34.624
HE WAS MURDERED TOO,
SO I KNOW HOW DIFFICULT--

15:34.660 --> 15:37.424
- PAULA WASN'T MURDERED.
WHO TOLD YOU THAT?

15:37.470 --> 15:39.222
- OH, NO ONE.

15:39.270 --> 15:42.592
I JUST ASSUMED, BECAUSE--

15:42.640 --> 15:46.007
- I HAVEN'T DONE
AN AUTOPSY YET.

15:52.510 --> 15:56.640
THERE ARE NO OBVIOUS SIGNS
OF FOUL PLAY.

15:56.680 --> 15:58.648
- I'M SORRY,
I DIDN'T MEAN TO--

15:58.690 --> 16:02.114
- NO, IT'S NOT YOU.

16:02.160 --> 16:04.253
LIKE I SAID, SHE WAS
A TROUBLED YOUNG GIRL.

16:04.290 --> 16:07.123
SHE HAD A DANGEROUS SIDE.

16:07.160 --> 16:08.593
NOTHING SCARED HER.

16:08.630 --> 16:10.666
NOT EVEN DYING.

16:10.700 --> 16:12.224
- YOU THINK SHE
MAY HAVE TAKEN HER OWN--

16:12.270 --> 16:14.738
- NO, I CAN'T
BEAR THAT THOUGHT.

16:14.770 --> 16:17.238
I'VE SAID TOO MUCH
TO A STRANGER.

16:17.270 --> 16:18.999
I SHOULD BE ASHAMED.

16:19.040 --> 16:20.974
- FOR CARING?

16:22.210 --> 16:24.349
NO, YOU SHOULDN'T.

16:24.380 --> 16:27.269
- OH. WHEW!

16:27.320 --> 16:29.538
YOU KNOW,
I ACTUALLY FEEL BETTER.

16:29.580 --> 16:33.152
THE MYNA BIRD
CAN COME IN NOW.

16:33.190 --> 16:34.487
WHAT'S UP NEXT?

16:34.520 --> 16:36.056
- WE NEED TO FIND
OUR CINNAMON KING.

16:36.090 --> 16:37.227
THAT KID HAS A SECRET.

16:37.260 --> 16:39.023
- WHAT DID
GRANDMA TELL YOU

16:39.060 --> 16:40.596
ABOUT WANDERING OFF
IN THE STORE?

16:44.130 --> 16:46.064
OH, COME ON.

16:46.100 --> 16:47.362
- I WAS GETTING READY
TO SAY--

16:47.400 --> 16:50.267
- THAT WOULD HAVE
BEEN TOO MUCH.

16:50.310 --> 16:53.131
DUDE.
THAT'S HIM.

16:53.180 --> 16:55.171
DUDE, THAT'S OUR GUY.

16:55.210 --> 16:56.507
- * YOU EVER CLOSE YOUR EYES
YOU'RE MAKING BELIEVE *

16:56.540 --> 16:59.100
* YOU'RE HOLDING THE ONE
YOU'RE DREAMING OF *

16:59.150 --> 17:00.674
* WELL IF YOU SAY SO

17:00.720 --> 17:02.574
* IT HURTS SO BAD
WHEN YOU FINALLY KNOW *

17:02.620 --> 17:04.212
* JUST HOW LOW LOW LOW

17:04.250 --> 17:06.514
* LOW LOW SHE'LL GO

17:06.550 --> 17:09.383
* BABY DID A BAD, BAD THING

17:09.420 --> 17:12.548
* BABY DID A BAD, BAD THING

17:12.590 --> 17:15.525
* BABY DID A BAD, BAD THING

17:15.560 --> 17:19.064
* FEEL LIKE CRYING

17:19.100 --> 17:21.830
* OOH

17:21.870 --> 17:24.134
* OOH OOH

17:24.170 --> 17:26.434
* FEEL LIKE CRYING

17:26.470 --> 17:31.806
* FEEL LIKE CRYING

17:31.850 --> 17:35.240
* OOH

17:36.820 --> 17:39.687
- OH, SHERIFF.
DIDN'T EXPECT TO SEE YOU HERE.

17:39.720 --> 17:42.154
- I LIVE HERE.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

17:42.190 --> 17:44.385
- OF COURSE YOU DO.

17:44.430 --> 17:46.489
YOU'RE RAN DY'S FATHER.

17:46.530 --> 17:48.725
YES, WOW.

17:48.760 --> 17:51.399
YOU GUYS HAVE BOB BARKER,
DOC GOODEN, AND RANDY JACKSON.

17:51.430 --> 17:53.466
ALL LIVING
IN THE SAME INLET TOWN

17:53.500 --> 17:54.797
WITH NO CARS,
CELL PHONES, OR INTERNET.

17:54.840 --> 17:56.831
- SHAWN, WE NEED
TO PITCH THIS TO MARK BURNETT.

17:56.870 --> 17:59.668
- YOU FELLAS REALIZE
THE FESTIVAL IS CANCELLED.

17:59.710 --> 18:01.678
AS YOU KNOW,
WE LOST SOMEONE

18:01.710 --> 18:03.177
VERY DEAR TO US TODAY.

18:03.210 --> 18:04.802
- THAT'S ACTUALLY WHY
WE DROPPED BY, SHERIFF.

18:04.850 --> 18:06.704
YOU SEE, GUS AND I
ARE GRIEF COUNSELORS

18:06.750 --> 18:07.774
BACK IN THE BIG CITY.

18:07.820 --> 18:10.380
- AND YOU ALL HAVE BEEN SO
KIND AND WELCOMING TO US

18:10.420 --> 18:11.819
THAT WE FIGURED
THE LEAST WE COULD DO

18:11.850 --> 18:14.387
WOULD BE TO OFFER OUR SERVICES
BEFORE WE LEFT TOWN.

18:14.420 --> 18:16.559
- WELL,
COME ON IN, FELLAS.

18:16.590 --> 18:19.457
- [quietly]
YEAH.

18:21.900 --> 18:24.698
- I'LL CONFESS, RANDY AND I
HAVEN'T BEEN COMMUNICATING

18:24.730 --> 18:28.131
TOO WELL AS OF LATE.

18:28.170 --> 18:33.437
I KNOW HE'S HURTING,
BUT HE WON'T TALK TO ME.

18:33.480 --> 18:35.277
- YOU KNOW,
IT WASN'T TOO LONG AGO

18:35.310 --> 18:36.572
THAT GUS AND I
WERE RANDY'S AGE.

18:36.610 --> 18:38.646
- IT WAS A PRETTY LONG
TIME AGO.

18:38.680 --> 18:40.716
- AH, IT WASN'T THAT LONG AGO.
- YOU LIKE TO THINK SO.

18:40.750 --> 18:41.717
- I CAN'T DO THIS WITH YOU
RIGHT NOW.

18:41.750 --> 18:43.286
- FINE.

18:43.320 --> 18:44.685
- HE'S UPSTAIRS IN HIS ROOM.

18:44.720 --> 18:45.846
- WE'LL GIVE IT A SHOT.

18:45.890 --> 18:48.654
- HMM.

18:54.730 --> 18:57.426
- SO MY DAD HIRED YOU
TO SHAKE ME DOWN, RIGHT?

18:57.470 --> 19:00.291
I'M FINE.
I BARELY KNEW PAULA.

19:00.340 --> 19:01.159
- THEN WHY DID
THE TWO OF YOU

19:01.200 --> 19:03.304
SHARE SECRET,
SPECIAL LOVER EARRINGS?

19:03.340 --> 19:04.898
COME ON, RANDY.

19:04.940 --> 19:06.805
HOW LONG HAD YOU
BEEN SEEING HER?

19:06.840 --> 19:08.273
- WHO ARE YOU?

19:08.310 --> 19:10.540
- A COUPLE OF GUYS WITH
A PASSION FOR THE TRUTH.

19:10.580 --> 19:13.674
- AND CINNAMON.

19:13.720 --> 19:16.518
- WE'D BEEN TOGETHER
SIX MONTHS.

19:16.550 --> 19:18.279
- WHY WAS IT A SECRET?

19:18.320 --> 19:19.548
- IT'S COM PLICATED.

19:19.590 --> 19:21.455
- I GET IT.
IT'S PRETTY IN PINK.

19:21.490 --> 19:23.424
YOU'RE ANDREW MCCARTHY.

19:23.460 --> 19:24.688
- WHO'S ANDREW MCCARTHY?

19:24.730 --> 19:25.856
- THAT'S FAIR.

19:25.890 --> 19:27.357
WHERE WERE YOU
THE NIGHT PAULA DIED?

19:27.400 --> 19:29.356
- I WAS AT THE LIBRARY,
STUDYING.

19:29.400 --> 19:30.560
THE LIBRARIAN
CAN CONFIRM IT.

19:30.600 --> 19:32.625
- DO YOU ALWAYS
STUDY SO LATE ON A FRIDAY?

19:32.670 --> 19:34.592
- I'M AT THE LIBRARY
ALMOST EVERY NIGHT.

19:34.640 --> 19:36.437
I'VE BEEN TAKING
CORRESPONDENCE COURSES.

19:36.470 --> 19:37.960
I NEED A BUSINESS DEGREE
TO BE A GOOD LEADER.

19:38.010 --> 19:41.173
- THAT'S '_|'RUE.
[muttering]

19:42.810 --> 19:45.506
- I NEVER
COULD HAVE HURT HER.

19:50.490 --> 19:53.812
I LOVED PAULA.

19:53.860 --> 19:57.250
WE WERE GONNA
SEE THE WORLD TOGETHER.

19:57.290 --> 20:01.659
I'M GONNA BE
SO LOST WITHOUT HER.

20:01.700 --> 20:04.965
[crying]
OH, PAULA.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.298
PAULA.

20:09.600 --> 20:11.636
PAULA.

20:16.340 --> 20:17.773
PAULA.

20:17.810 --> 20:20.347
_ THAT'S A LITTLE DRAMATIC,
DON'T YOU THINK?

20:22.020 --> 20:24.739
YOU HAVE A PROBLEM.

20:39.330 --> 20:40.399
EXCUSE US.

20:40.440 --> 20:41.691
- SHH.

20:41.740 --> 20:43.833
KEEP YOUR VOICE DOWN, PLEASE.

20:43.870 --> 20:46.407
- IT'S JUST US AND YOU.

20:46.440 --> 20:48.977
- JUST A BUNCH OF WORDS ON PAPER
TO YOU GUYS, RIGHT?

20:49.010 --> 20:51.308
WRONG.

20:51.350 --> 20:54.319
EACH IS ALIVE
WITH A STORY TO TELL.

20:54.350 --> 20:56.545
LISTEN.

20:58.920 --> 21:03.380
I'M JUST MESSING
WITH YOU GUYS.

21:03.430 --> 21:05.751
THANKS FOR PLAYING ALONG.
THAT'S REALLY SWEET.

21:05.790 --> 21:08.554
I'M MAUDETTE HORNSBY.

21:08.600 --> 21:11.592
ISN'T CHERRY THE BEST?
[slurps]

21:11.630 --> 21:12.824
- THE BEST WHAT?

21:12.870 --> 21:15.964
- EVERYTHING, SILLY.

21:16.000 --> 21:17.729
I THOUGHT YOU WERE PSYCHIC.

21:17.770 --> 21:19.306
- I AM.
I'M THE PSYCHIC.

21:19.340 --> 21:20.773
BUT HOW DID YOU KNOW THAT?

21:20.810 --> 21:22.300
- MM, WORD TRAVELS.

21:22.340 --> 21:24.308
YOU KNOW, WE DON'T GET
A LOT OF GOSSIP AROUND HERE.

21:24.350 --> 21:27.979
SO UNTIMELY DEATH,
A PSYCHIC,

21:28.020 --> 21:29.419
AND A BLACK MAN,
ALL IN ONE DAY.

21:29.450 --> 21:31.338
EPIC.

21:31.390 --> 21:32.789
- I REALLY THOUGHT
WE WERE BEING DISCREET.

21:32.820 --> 21:34.082
- DO YOU EVEN KNOW
WHAT DISCREET IS?

21:34.120 --> 21:35.781
THAT'S A SERIOUS QUESTION.

21:35.820 --> 21:38.550
- I KNOW WHAT--
- SHH!

21:38.590 --> 21:40.922
WAS RAN DY JACKSON
WITH YOU THE NIGHT PAULA DIED?

21:40.960 --> 21:42.052
- WHY?
DO YOU THINK SHE WAS

21:42.100 --> 21:43.988
M-U-R-D-E-R-E-D
OR SOMETHING?

21:44.030 --> 21:45.861
- M-A-Y-B-E.

21:45.900 --> 21:48.596
- YES, RANDY WAS HERE.

21:48.640 --> 21:52.007
WE HAVE
A VERY SPECIAL BOND,

21:52.040 --> 21:53.530
YOU SEE.

21:53.580 --> 21:55.639
HIS MOM PASSED AWAY
WHEN HE WAS VERY YOUNG.

21:55.680 --> 21:57.375
SHERIFF JACKSON
NEVER REMARRIED.

21:57.410 --> 22:03.042
SO I SORT OF STEPPED IN
AND FILLED A ROLE.

22:03.080 --> 22:05.480
FOR BOTH OF THEM.

22:10.890 --> 22:12.755
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
YOU NEED TO KNOW?

22:12.790 --> 22:15.918
- UH, FEELS
PRETTY GOOD FOR NOW.

22:15.960 --> 22:17.518
- DO YOU MIND
IF WE POKE AROUND?

22:17.570 --> 22:18.559
- POKE.
- PEEK.

22:18.600 --> 22:19.589
- PEEK.
- PEEK AROUND.

22:19.630 --> 22:21.131
- YES.

22:21.170 --> 22:22.728
- KNOCK YOURSELVES OUT.

22:22.770 --> 22:25.534
- OKAY, REMEMBER
THE LAST EMAIL,

22:25.570 --> 22:27.128
THE ONE WITH
ALL THE WEIRD HIEROGLYPHICS?

22:27.170 --> 22:28.671
- THEY WERE LETTERS
AND NUMBERS, SHAWN.

22:28.710 --> 22:29.870
- OKAY, IT WAS ONE
OF THESE THINGS.

22:29.910 --> 22:31.104
- THE DEWEY DECIMAL SYSTEM?

22:31.150 --> 22:32.708
I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW
THEY STILL USED THIS.

22:34.020 --> 22:34.975
WHEN THE PAYOFF IS
JANE EYRE.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.419
- WHAT WAS THE NUMBER, SHAWN?

22:36.450 --> 22:38.987
- F796.352.

22:39.020 --> 22:42.057
- 700$,
THAT'S SPORTS AND RECREATION.

22:43.460 --> 22:46.384
- [slurps]

22:49.560 --> 22:51.027
- THESE BOOKS ARE ARCHAIC.

22:51.070 --> 22:53.834
- AND REALLY OLD.

22:53.870 --> 22:56.498
- EXCEPT THIS ONE.

22:56.540 --> 22:58.599
- PUTT YOUR WAY
TO A BETTER LIFE.

22:58.640 --> 22:59.834
- BY EARL WYNDAM.

22:59.870 --> 23:03.749
- MY SHORT GAME
COULD USE SOME WORK.

23:03.780 --> 23:05.839
- THERE'S NO PICTURES?

23:05.880 --> 23:07.939
- THIS IS THE WEIRDEST
GOLF BOOK I'VE EVER SEEN.

23:07.980 --> 23:09.015
- LET ME SEE THAT.

23:09.050 --> 23:12.986
REINCARNATION
AND REBIRTH.

23:13.020 --> 23:15.580
OUR EMAILER WANTS US TO THINK
THAT PAULA WAS REINCARNATED?

23:15.620 --> 23:16.757
WE SHOULD
GET BACK TO THE LAKE.

23:16.790 --> 23:20.829
JULIET SHOULD
HAVE SOMETHING BY NOW.

23:20.860 --> 23:22.191
- YOU'RE GONNA NEED
A LIBRARY CARD

23:22.230 --> 23:24.460
IF YOU WANT TO CHECK
SOMETHING OUT.

23:24.500 --> 23:26.991
- I THINK WE'RE GOOD,
MAUDETTE.

23:32.140 --> 23:34.677
- JULIET, IT'S GUS.

23:34.710 --> 23:37.201
- GUS, WHAT'S GOING ON?
IS SHAWN OKAY?

23:37.240 --> 23:38.901
- OH, HE'S FINE.
- TELL HER I SAID HI.

23:38.950 --> 23:40.747
ASK HER
WHAT SHE'S WEARING.

23:40.780 --> 23:42.475
- DO YOU HAVE ANYTHING
ON PAULA MERRAL?

23:42.520 --> 23:43.646
-DO I?

23:43.690 --> 23:44.918
LOOK, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU GUYS

23:44.950 --> 23:46.486
HAVE GOTTEN YOURSELVES
INTO UP THERE,

23:46.520 --> 23:49.057
BUT PAULA MERRAL DROWNED HERE
SEVEN YEARS AGO.

23:50.990 --> 23:52.753
- WHAT?

23:52.790 --> 23:54.758
DID SHE SAY HI BACK?

24:06.040 --> 24:07.473
- IS HE LOOKING AT US?

24:07.510 --> 24:10.502
- I THINK HE IS.

24:10.550 --> 24:12.700
- DUDE, TAKE IT EASY.

24:12.750 --> 24:13.717
THAT'S YOUR SEVENTH PIECE.

24:13.750 --> 24:15.843
- YOU KNOW I GET HUNGRY
WHEN I GET FREAKED OUT.

24:15.880 --> 24:16.778
BESIDES, YOU'VE HAD FIVE.

24:16.820 --> 24:19.618
- EXACTLY, I BELIEVE
IN PORTION CONTROL.

24:19.650 --> 24:20.787
- A GIRL DROWNS,
GETS REINCARNATED,

24:20.820 --> 24:22.117
AND DROWNS AGAIN
SEVEN YEARS LATER?

24:22.160 --> 24:24.856
WORST CINNAMON FESTIVAL EVER.

24:26.660 --> 24:28.252
WE DEFINITELY
STICK OUT AROUND HERE.

24:28.300 --> 24:30.518
- TRUE,
BUT NOT AS BAD AS THEM.

24:34.670 --> 24:38.106
- WHAT ARE YOU
STARING AT, JESUP?

24:38.140 --> 24:39.698
SCOOT.

24:39.740 --> 24:42.573
- WOW, DID YOU GUYS JUST HOOF IT
FROM THE HIGHWAY?

24:42.610 --> 24:44.271
- WHAT?
OH, HELL NO.

24:44.310 --> 24:45.971
NO, WE TOOK THE SEVEN-MILE
DIRT ROAD THAT CONNECTS

24:46.010 --> 24:47.944
THIS CRAP HOLE
TO THE NEXT TOWN OVER.

24:47.980 --> 24:49.971
- WE CAME UP HERE
BECAUSE THE CHIEF WANTED US

24:50.020 --> 24:51.112
TO GET A POSITIVE I.D.
ON PAULA MERRAL'S BODY.

24:51.150 --> 24:53.710
- TO SEE IF IT MATCHED
THE ONE FOUND IN SANTA BARBARA?

24:53.760 --> 24:54.749
- NO, SEE THAT'S THE THING.

24:54.790 --> 24:55.859
WE NEVER RECOVERED HER BODY.

24:55.890 --> 24:57.551
WHICH DIDN'T
SIT WELL WITH ME.

24:57.590 --> 25:00.593
THE INLET WHERE SHE SUPPOSEDLY
DROWNED HAS NO CURRENT,

25:00.630 --> 25:01.858
WHICH MEANS HER BODY
SHOULD HAVE FLOATED UP

25:01.900 --> 25:05.222
BETWEEN 2.3 T0 3.1 DAYS.

25:05.270 --> 25:07.067
OH, I KNOW THIS BECAUSE WAITING
FOR CORPSES TO RESURFACE

25:07.100 --> 25:09.568
IS A PASSION OF MY LIFE.

25:09.600 --> 25:10.760
- THE SWEATER SHE WAS WEARING
WAS FOUND ON THE SHORELINE.

25:10.810 --> 25:13.233
AND HER BIKE WAS DISCOVERED
AT THE END OF A NEARBY DOCK.

25:13.270 --> 25:15.579
- IT WAS LYING NEXT TO A PILE
OF SUNFLOWER SEEDS,

25:15.610 --> 25:17.009
WHICH WAS ALSO WEIRD.

25:17.040 --> 25:20.146
WHAT 11-YEAR-OLD GIRL
CHEWS SUNFLOWER SEEDS?

25:23.850 --> 25:24.839
- EXCUSE ME, FLO.

25:24.890 --> 25:25.811
WHERE MIGHT WE FIND

25:25.850 --> 25:27.750
THE PROPRIETORS
OF THIS FINE ESTABLISHMENT?

25:27.790 --> 25:29.018
- ROBERT AND MICHELLE?

25:29.060 --> 25:30.925
THEY'VE BEEN HOME
EVER SINCE THEY GOT

25:30.960 --> 25:33.622
THE NEWS ABOUT PAULA.

25:38.030 --> 25:39.019
- DO YOU HAVE SOMETHING

25:39.070 --> 25:40.731
YOU WANT TO TELL US,
MR. BARKER?

25:40.770 --> 25:43.261
- [sighs]

25:43.300 --> 25:46.098
12 YEARS AGO,
MICHELLE'S SISTER LUCY

25:46.140 --> 25:47.630
RAN AWAY FROM DUAL SPIRES,

25:47.680 --> 25:49.238
TAKING THE SEVEN-YEAR-OLD
PAULA WITH HER.

25:49.280 --> 25:51.703
WE WERE WORRIED SICK
ABOUT PAULA.

25:51.750 --> 25:55.641
SEE, LUCY WAS AN INCREDIBLY
UNSTABLE PERSON.

25:55.680 --> 25:57.989
MICHELLE AND I PRACTICALLY
RAISED HER DAUGHTER FOR HER.

25:58.020 --> 26:00.580
THEN ONE DAY,
WE GOT A LETTER FROM PAULA

26:00.620 --> 26:02.759
CONFIRMING
OUR WORST FEARS.

26:02.790 --> 26:04.326
IT DESCRIBED HOW
MAGIC WHITE ROCKS

26:04.360 --> 26:05.918
WERE MAKING HER MOM CRAZY.

26:05.960 --> 26:08.053
- METHAMPHETAMINES?
- ALONG WITH OTHER STUFF.

26:08.100 --> 26:09.590
A COUPLE OF LETTERS
AFTER THAT

26:09.630 --> 26:11.029
WAS THE FIRST MENTION
OF THE ABUSE.

26:11.070 --> 26:12.799
AND THAT'S WHEN WE KNEW
WE HAD TO ACT.

26:12.830 --> 26:14.730
- YOU HELPED HER
FAKE HER DEATH?

26:14.770 --> 26:17.034
- WE HAD NO OTHER CHOICE.
LUCY WOULDN'T LET HER GO.

26:17.070 --> 26:18.139
AND PAULA WAS ALL FOR IT.

26:18.170 --> 26:19.865
IN FACT,
IT WAS HER IDEA.

26:19.910 --> 26:20.672
- IT DOESN'T MATTER.

26:20.710 --> 26:22.598
WHAT YOU DID
WAS AGAINST THE LAW.

26:22.640 --> 26:24.141
IF I HAD JURISDICTION HERE,
YOU'D BE UNDER ARREST

26:24.180 --> 26:25.602
FOR OBSTRUCT ION OF JUSTICE.

26:25.650 --> 26:27.242
- SHE WAS HAPPY HERE.

26:27.280 --> 26:28.269
AND SAFE.

26:28.320 --> 26:30.117
- UNTIL TWO DAYS AGO.

26:30.150 --> 26:32.311
- RIGHT.

26:32.350 --> 26:34.113
- I'M HEADING BACK
TO SANTA BARBARA

26:34.160 --> 26:35.354
TO REOPEN THIS CASE,
MR. BARKER.

26:35.390 --> 26:36.209
ONCE I DO,

26:36.260 --> 26:37.750
A WARRANT WILL BE ISSUED
FOR YOUR ARREST.

26:37.790 --> 26:39.758
COME ON, O'HARA.

26:39.790 --> 26:42.224
- CALL WHEN YOU CAN.

26:42.260 --> 26:44.091
- YOU TWO UNDERSTAND, RIGHT?

26:44.130 --> 26:46.121
- WE'RE NOT HERE
TO JUDGE YOU, MR. BARKER.

26:46.170 --> 26:48.058
WE CAME TO INVESTIGATE,
CATCH BAD GUYS,

26:48.100 --> 26:49.169
AND EAT PIE.

26:49.200 --> 26:50.189
- NOT NECESSARILY
IN THAT ORDER.

26:50.240 --> 26:51.400
- AND IT HASN'T BEEN.
- NO.

26:51.440 --> 26:52.509
- WE STARTED WITH THE PIE.
- ALWAYS.

26:52.540 --> 26:55.998
- DO YOU THINK WE COULD
TAKE A LOOK IN PAULA'S ROOM?

26:56.040 --> 26:58.008
- BY ALL MEANS.
WE HAVEN'T TOUCHED A THING.

26:58.050 --> 27:00.109
IT'S AT THE TOP OF THE STAIRS
ON THE RIGHT.

27:03.050 --> 27:05.985
- DUDE, THE DOCTOR/OMBUDSMAN
WASN'T KIDDING.

27:06.020 --> 27:08.079
SISTER DEFINITELY
HAD A DARK SIDE.

27:08.120 --> 27:10.259
- HMM.

27:10.290 --> 27:11.848
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

27:11.890 --> 27:14.199
- LOOKING FOR PLACES
SHE MAY HAVE HID STUFF.

27:19.770 --> 27:21.965
EVERY TEENAGER
HAS A SECRET SPOT, GUS.

27:22.000 --> 27:23.706
REMEMBER
WHEN I FOUND THOSE

27:23.740 --> 27:24.934
WEIRD PHOTOS OF JOHN CUSACK
IN YOUR NIGHTSTAND?

27:24.970 --> 27:26.733
- THAT WAS JOAN.

27:26.770 --> 27:28.738
- REALLY?
OH, THAT'S MUCH LESS WEIRD.

27:28.780 --> 27:32.307
WAIT. NO, IT'S NOT.
NOT REALLY. INCOMING.

27:35.720 --> 27:38.382
- DUDE.

27:41.990 --> 27:43.753
- DIARY.
JACKPOT.

27:43.790 --> 27:46.224
- WHAT DOES IT SAY?

27:46.260 --> 27:48.125
- "MATH WAS REALLY HARD TODAY."

27:48.160 --> 27:49.354
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH.

27:49.400 --> 27:52.722
SEEMS LIKE NORMAL
HIGH SCHOOL STUFF TO ME.

27:52.770 --> 27:54.294
WHOA.

27:54.340 --> 27:55.432
WHAT IS THIS LANGUAGE?

27:55.470 --> 27:58.337
IS THIS CHINESE?
- NO.

27:58.370 --> 27:59.860
IT'S LATIN, SHAWN.

27:59.910 --> 28:02.105
- LATIN?

28:02.140 --> 28:03.277
GUS, PAULA MUST HAVE THOUGHT

28:03.310 --> 28:04.106
SOMEONE WAS READING
HER DIARY.

28:04.150 --> 28:05.742
- WE GOTTA FIND OUT
WHAT THAT SAYS.

28:05.780 --> 28:08.010
- YEAH, BUT WHO DO WE KNOW
THAT SPEAKS LATIN.

28:08.050 --> 28:12.419
"ABSENS...HAERES."
HAERES?

28:12.450 --> 28:13.781
AND "NON ERIT."
DID YOU GET ALL THAT?

28:13.820 --> 28:15.754
- UH-HUH.
I BELIEVE SO.

28:15.790 --> 28:17.314
HAVEN'T YOU EVER HEARD
OF FAXING, SHAWN?

28:17.360 --> 28:18.759
- I'M SORRY, FATHER.

28:18.790 --> 28:19.882
WE DON'T HAVE THAT CAPABILITY
RIGHT NOW.

28:19.930 --> 28:21.158
BESIDES, I THOUGHT
THAT PRIESTS THOUGHT

28:21.200 --> 28:23.293
ALL TECHNOLOGY
WAS EVIL.

28:23.330 --> 28:24.467
- IT'S ONLY NOW THAT IT
BEGINS TO DAWN ON ME

28:24.500 --> 28:26.468
HOW LITTLE YOU LEARNED
IN MY CCD CLASS.

28:26.500 --> 28:28.388
- FATHER, IT'S VERY IMPORTANT
THAT WE UNDERSTAND

28:28.440 --> 28:29.930
WHAT THESE PASSAGES MEAN.

28:29.970 --> 28:31.107
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

28:31.140 --> 28:32.767
WELL, THIS FIRST PART
TALKS ABOUT

28:32.810 --> 28:34.300
A YOUNG BOY
SHE WAS SEEING.

28:34.340 --> 28:36.171
SOMEONE POPULAR.
- RAN DY.

28:36.210 --> 28:37.302
- YEAH, THAT MAKES SENSE.

28:37.340 --> 28:39.342
SHE REFERS TO HIM AS "R."

28:39.380 --> 28:41.348
AH, SHE MAY HAVE ALSO
BEEN SEEING SOMEONE ELSE.

28:41.380 --> 28:42.916
- EXCELLENT,
IS THERE A NAME?

28:42.950 --> 28:44.178
- NO, JUST THE LETTER "J."

28:44.220 --> 28:46.108
- LETTER "J."

28:46.150 --> 28:47.879
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU FATHER.
YOU'VE BEEN SO MUCH HELP.

28:47.920 --> 28:49.012
GUS WILL SEE YOU
AT CHURCH ON SUNDAY.

28:49.060 --> 28:50.084
- UH-HUH,
WHAT ABOUT YOU?

28:50.120 --> 28:52.987
- WHAT?
OH, YOU'RE BREAKING UP.

28:53.030 --> 28:54.019
- WHAT? WHAT--

28:54.060 --> 28:55.197
- CAN'T HEAR ANYTHING.

28:55.230 --> 28:56.356
[electronic tones]
HELLO? FATHER?

28:56.400 --> 28:58.197
- WHOA, WHOA, WAIT, WAIT.
THERE'S MORE.

28:58.230 --> 29:01.961
- IT REALLY IS
ONE SQUARE FOOT OF COVERAGE.

29:02.000 --> 29:04.867
JULES, WHAT ARE YOU
DOING HERE?

29:04.910 --> 29:06.229
- WELL, LASSITER'S HANDLING
THE REOPENING OF THE CASE

29:06.270 --> 29:07.259
BACK AT THE DEPARTMENT,

29:07.310 --> 29:08.937
SO I THOUGHT I WOULD
COME BACK AND LEND A HAND.

29:08.980 --> 29:10.538
- FANTASTIC.
WE HAVE TO HIT THE LIBRARY,

29:10.580 --> 29:12.047
FOLLOW UP ON A VISION
I JUST HAD.

29:12.080 --> 29:13.172
- ALL RIGHT, WELL,
YOU TWO GO AHEAD.

29:13.210 --> 29:14.108
I'M GONNA NOTIFY
SHERIFF JACKSON

29:14.150 --> 29:14.912
THAT I'M GONNA BE
LOOKING INTO THE CASE.

29:14.950 --> 29:16.417
- WHAT DO YOU SAY
WE ALL MEET UP

29:16.450 --> 29:17.781
AT THE DINER AT, UH...

29:17.820 --> 29:19.082
4:30?

29:19.120 --> 29:20.382
LABRADOODLE!

29:20.420 --> 29:22.251
- WHERE?

29:22.290 --> 29:24.281
- WE SHOULD GO.

29:24.330 --> 29:25.479
- I DIDN'T SEE
ANY LABRADOODLE, SHAWN.

29:25.530 --> 29:26.758
- WELL, YOU WEREN'T
LOOKING VERY HARD.

29:32.400 --> 29:33.833
NICE SHOES.

29:33.870 --> 29:35.792
- I KNOW.

29:35.840 --> 29:36.864
- GUS WAS WONDERING
IF YOU WOULD LIKE TO

29:36.900 --> 29:39.164
BE HIS DATE TO BETTY BOOP NIGHT
AT THE ROAD HOUSE.

29:39.210 --> 29:41.235
- THEY DON'T HAVE A BETTY BOOP
NIGHT AT THE ROAD HOUSE.

29:41.280 --> 29:43.475
- OH, THEN THEY DON'T HAVE
MY BUSINESS ANYMORE, EITHER.

29:43.510 --> 29:46.308
- SURE YOU CAN
KEEP UP WITH ME?

29:46.350 --> 29:50.070
I LIKE TO DANCE
ALL NIGHT LONG.

29:53.920 --> 29:56.252
- WELL...SHAWN.

29:56.290 --> 29:57.484
- WHAT?

29:57.520 --> 29:59.021
- RELAX.

29:59.060 --> 30:01.324
OKAY, HERE WE GO.

30:01.360 --> 30:04.090
THIS IS THE MOST RECENT
DUAL SPIRES YEARBOOK.

30:04.130 --> 30:05.290
- THANK YOU, MAUDETTE.

30:05.330 --> 30:06.365
FEELS A LITTLE THIN.

30:06.400 --> 30:07.469
- SMALL BOOK
FOR A SMALL SCHOOL.

30:07.500 --> 30:09.593
- THERE WERE ONLY SIX PEOPLE
IN THE GRADUATING CLASS?

30:09.640 --> 30:11.301
- YEAH, AND EVEN THAT
WAS LARGE.

30:11.340 --> 30:12.432
MINE ONLY HAD THREE.

30:12.470 --> 30:14.028
- YOU, ROBERT, AND MICHELLE?

30:14.080 --> 30:16.275
- YOU'RE VERY IMPRESSIVE,
MR. SPENCER.

30:16.310 --> 30:18.608
- NONE OF THE GUYS
IN PAULA'S CLASS

30:18.650 --> 30:19.947
HAVE NAMES THAT
BEGIN WITH "J."

30:19.980 --> 30:22.346
- LET'S SEE HERE.

30:22.380 --> 30:25.042
PAULA SURE IS
IN A LOT OF PHOTOS.

30:25.090 --> 30:26.182
- OH, THAT'S NOT SURPRISING.

30:26.220 --> 30:28.882
SHE LOVED THE ATTENTION.

30:42.040 --> 30:44.258
- HUH.

30:44.310 --> 30:48.076
THANK YOU, MAUDETTE.

30:48.110 --> 30:50.499
- BYE, GUS.

31:01.490 --> 31:02.582
- WHOA, JACK.

31:02.620 --> 31:04.087
YOU DIDN'T EVEN
GIVE ME A CHANCE

31:04.130 --> 31:05.279
TO SEE IF I HAD
FOOD IN MY TEETH.

31:05.330 --> 31:06.422
- YOU'RE GOOD.

31:06.460 --> 31:08.098
- I'M SHAWN.
HE'S BLACKMUNN.

31:08.130 --> 31:09.529
- YEAH, YEAH.
I KNOW WHO YOU ARE.

31:09.560 --> 31:10.925
- OH, GOOD,
SO YOU KNOW WE'RE HERE

31:10.970 --> 31:14.235
TO ASK YOU SOME QUESTIONS
ABOUT PAULA.

31:17.640 --> 31:20.336
- YOU, UH,
YOU EVER THINK ABOUT HANGING

31:20.370 --> 31:22.031
ANY OF YOUR PHOTOS
ON THE WALL?

31:22.080 --> 31:23.638
- WELL, TO ME,
EACH PHOTO IS LIKE A MEMORY,

31:23.680 --> 31:25.568
SO I LIKE TO KEEP THEM CLOSE.

31:25.610 --> 31:27.168
- LOOKS LIKE YOU AND PAULA

31:27.210 --> 31:29.075
WERE MORE THAN
JUST FRIENDS, HUH?

31:31.150 --> 31:32.185
- YEAH, WE WERE.

31:32.220 --> 31:34.188
UNTIL ABOUT A YEAR AGO,

31:34.220 --> 31:35.482
SHE LEFT ME
FOR THE CINNAMON KING.

31:35.520 --> 31:37.613
- YOU MUST HAVE BEEN
PRETTY ANGRY WITH HER.

31:37.660 --> 31:40.458
- AT FIRST I WAS, YEAH.

31:40.490 --> 31:42.321
BUT THEN WE BECAME
BEST FRIENDS.

31:42.360 --> 31:43.691
I WAS HER CONFIDANT.

31:43.730 --> 31:45.698
WE WOULD LIP SYNCH
TO OLD RECORDS TOGETHER.

31:45.730 --> 31:47.937
- JON CRYER
FROM PRETTY IN PINK.

31:47.970 --> 31:50.188
- NO ONE IN THIS TOWN HAS EVER
SEEN THAT MOVIE, SHAWN.

31:50.240 --> 31:52.003
- WELL, I REFUSE
TO ACCEPT THAT.

31:52.040 --> 31:53.132
[glass shatters]

31:53.170 --> 31:54.398
WHOOPS.

31:54.440 --> 31:55.702
JACK,
THAT'S MY BAD.

31:55.740 --> 31:57.674
UH, LET ME CLEAN THIS--
- NO, NO, NO, NO.

31:57.710 --> 31:58.745
DON'T, DON'T, DON'T.

31:58.780 --> 32:02.011
THE BROKEN GLASS WILL MAKE
FOR A BEAUTIFUL PHOTO.

32:02.050 --> 32:04.416
- YEAH, IT WILL.

32:07.690 --> 32:09.282
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK?

32:09.320 --> 32:10.287
YOU THINK THIS GUY
KILLED PAULA?

32:10.320 --> 32:11.651
- MOST DEFINITELY.

32:11.690 --> 32:14.295
HE'S A FREAKY DUDE
LIVING IN A FREAKY PLACE.

32:14.330 --> 32:15.456
AND HAVE YOU NOTICED
HE WON'T EVER MAKE

32:15.500 --> 32:17.092
EYE CONTACT WITH YOU?

32:17.130 --> 32:18.529
THERE'S ONLY
ONE REASON FOR THAT.

32:18.570 --> 32:20.322
GUILT.

32:24.410 --> 32:27.061
- ACTUALLY,
THERE MAY BE ANOTHER.

32:27.110 --> 32:28.509
HEY, JACK.

32:28.540 --> 32:33.341
THE GLASS IS OVER HERE, MAN.

32:33.380 --> 32:35.519
- I KNOW.
YEAH.

32:39.490 --> 32:41.458
- I GOTTA TELL YOU,
YOU ARE THE HIGHEST FUNCTIONING

32:41.490 --> 32:43.981
BLIND PERSON
THAT I'VE EVER SEEN.

32:46.090 --> 32:49.253
- I'M NOT TECHNICALLY BLIND.

32:49.300 --> 32:52.064
I STILL HAVE 30% VISION
IN MY RIGHT EYE...

32:52.100 --> 32:54.261
FOR NOW.

32:54.300 --> 32:56.734
A COUPLE OF YEARS AGO,
I DEVELOPED EARLY ONSET

32:56.770 --> 32:58.601
MACULAR DEGENERATION.

32:58.640 --> 33:01.473
- I'M SENSING
IT WAS AROUND '05.

33:01.510 --> 33:03.171
- YEAH, THAT'S RIGHT.

33:03.210 --> 33:05.405
- WHERE WERE YOU
THE NIGHT PAULA DISAPPEARED?

33:05.450 --> 33:06.599
- I WAS WITH HER.

33:06.650 --> 33:09.448
AT THE BEGINNING
OF THE NIGHT.

33:09.480 --> 33:14.349
WE TOOK A WALK IN THE FOREST,
AND SHE TOLD ME

33:14.390 --> 33:16.358
SHE WANTED
TO LEAVE DUAL SPIRES.

33:16.390 --> 33:18.153
AND I SAID
THAT WAS A MISTAKE.

33:18.190 --> 33:21.091
AND THEN, JET BLACKNESS.

33:21.130 --> 33:22.427
- WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

33:22.460 --> 33:24.166
- IT WOULD BE
A GREAT PORN NAME FOR YOU.

33:24.200 --> 33:25.394
- I WOKE UP
ABOUT AN HOUR LATER.

33:25.430 --> 33:30.038
WITH THIS,
A BUMP ON MY HEAD.

33:30.070 --> 33:31.207
AND THERE WAS NO PAULA.

33:31.240 --> 33:32.559
- SHE KNOCKED YOU OUT?

33:32.610 --> 33:34.077
COME ON, JACK.
A BIG GUY LIKE YOU?

33:34.110 --> 33:35.202
- NO, NO, NO.

33:35.240 --> 33:37.071
SOMEBODY ELSE
SNUCK UP ON ME,

33:37.110 --> 33:38.702
AND I WASN'T LOOKING.

33:38.750 --> 33:39.808
- WELL, YOU COULD
HAVE BEEN LOOKING.

33:39.850 --> 33:41.249
PROBABLY WOULDN'T HAVE MADE
MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE.

33:41.280 --> 33:42.679
- HE'S PRACTICALLY BLIND.

33:42.720 --> 33:44.813
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TAKE ANY OF
THIS TO THE SHERIFF, JACK?

33:44.850 --> 33:48.081
- BECAUSE I MAY HAVE BEEN
THE LAST PERSON

33:48.120 --> 33:48.916
TO EVER SEE HER ALIVE,

33:48.960 --> 33:52.179
AND MY STORY
SOUNDS FISHY AT BEST.

33:52.230 --> 33:53.754
I MEAN,
DO YOU BELIEVE ME?

33:53.790 --> 33:57.089
- WERE YOU TAKING PHOTOS
THAT NIGHT ON THE WALK?

33:57.130 --> 33:58.768
- YEAH, YEAH.
OF COURSE I WAS.

33:58.800 --> 34:01.837
- WELL, WHY DON'T YOU LET US
TAKE A LOOK AT THAT FILM?

34:01.870 --> 34:04.361
- OKAY.

34:04.410 --> 34:06.207
- OOH.
- WHY?

34:06.240 --> 34:07.309
- OH, THIS IS GOOD.

34:07.340 --> 34:11.106
THIS WILL GO WELL WITH
THE FIVE SHOTS OF HER BOOTS.

34:11.150 --> 34:12.674
- TAKE A BLINDFOLDED
PHOTO SOMETIME.

34:12.710 --> 34:15.076
LET ME KNOW
HOW IT TURNS OUT.

34:15.120 --> 34:17.372
- WAIT A SECOND.
HERE'S SOMETHING.

34:22.790 --> 34:24.519
- DUDE,
WE GOTTA GET TO JULES.

34:32.670 --> 34:35.230
- HI, I'M LOOKING
FOR SHERIFF JACKSON.

34:35.270 --> 34:36.760
THE DEPUTY SAID
I COULD FIND HIM HERE.

34:36.800 --> 34:40.406
- YEAH, UH, HE JUST
STEPPED OUT FOR A SEC.

34:40.440 --> 34:42.635
- DO YOU KNOW
WHEN HE'LL BE BACK?

34:42.680 --> 34:44.238
- OH, ANY MINUTE NOW.

34:44.280 --> 34:45.770
YOU CAN WAIT
IN THE BACK WITH ME.

34:45.810 --> 34:48.415
I'M JUST DOING
A LITTLE WORK FOR SHOP CLASS.

34:48.450 --> 34:50.816
- OKAY.
I'M JULIET O'HARA.

34:50.850 --> 34:53.739
- RAN DY.
RAN DY JACKSON.

35:25.420 --> 35:27.240
- HOW MUCH DO YOU WEIGH?

35:27.290 --> 35:28.484
- EXCUSE ME?

35:28.520 --> 35:29.919
- I'M SORRY,
I'M NOT SUPPOSED TO

35:29.960 --> 35:31.552
ASK A WOMAN
THAT QUESTION, AM I?

35:31.590 --> 35:34.297
- NOT UNLESS YOU'RE
PILOTING A VERY SMALL PLANE.

35:37.200 --> 35:38.690
- ABOUT 105?

35:38.730 --> 35:39.822
- WILL YOUR DAD
BE HERE SOON?

35:39.870 --> 35:42.430
- I'D IMAGINE SO.

35:42.470 --> 35:43.869
PAULA WEIGHED ABOUT 105.

35:43.900 --> 35:46.164
YOU KIND OF REMIND ME OF HER.

35:46.210 --> 35:49.429
- I UNDERSTAND
YOU TWO WERE QUITE CLOSE.

35:49.480 --> 35:51.300
I'M SORRY FOR YOUR LOSS.

35:51.350 --> 35:54.717
- YEAH, IT'S A REAL TRAGEDY.

35:54.750 --> 35:56.240
- YOU KNOW WHAT?

35:56.280 --> 35:58.441
WHY DON'T I JUST COME BACK
IN, LIKE, AN HOUR OR SO.

35:58.490 --> 36:00.481
- NO.

36:00.520 --> 36:05.685
STAY.

36:05.730 --> 36:07.584
- HEY!

36:07.630 --> 36:09.291
GET YOUR WOOD
OUT OF HER FACE, RANDY.

36:09.330 --> 36:10.524
- WHAT'S GOING ON?

36:10.560 --> 36:12.562
- WE KNOW YOU
KNOCKED OUT JACK SMITH,

36:12.600 --> 36:14.329
WHEN HE WAS WITH PAULA
THE NIGHT SHE DIED.

36:14.370 --> 36:16.395
- YEAH, I THOUGHT HE WAS
TRYING TO STEAL MY GIRLFRIEND.

36:16.440 --> 36:17.395
- REALLY?

36:17.440 --> 36:18.236
YOU'RE JEALOUS
OF THE GOOFY KID

36:18.270 --> 36:19.703
WHO SNAPS PHOTOS
LIKE JOSE FELICIANO?

36:19.740 --> 36:21.469
- HEY, PAULA
ALWAYS HAD A THING FOR HIM.

36:21.510 --> 36:23.432
- FOR JOSE FELICIANO?

36:23.480 --> 36:24.640
- NO, JACK.

36:24.680 --> 36:27.478
I JUST GAVE HIM A SUPER ELBOW
AND HE CRUMBLED LIKE FETA.

36:27.510 --> 36:28.408
- WHAT DID PAULA DO?

36:28.450 --> 36:29.815
- SHE FREAKED OUT
AND WENT ON THIS RANT

36:29.850 --> 36:30.919
ABOUT HOW
I'M A HYPOCRITE

36:30.950 --> 36:32.838
'CAUSE I SPEND A LOT OF TIME
WITH MY EX-GIRLFRIEND.

36:32.890 --> 36:34.255
- AND WHO'S THAT?

36:34.290 --> 36:37.919
- THAT'S NONE
OF YOUR BUSINESS.

36:37.960 --> 36:39.757
- WHAT IS IT WITH ALL THE SECRET
RELATIONSHIPS IN THIS TOWN?

36:39.790 --> 36:42.691
IT'S LIKE GENERAL HOSPITAL.

36:42.730 --> 36:44.789
YOU'RE KIDDING ME.

36:44.830 --> 36:46.229
ALL RIGHT, THAT'S IT.

36:46.270 --> 36:48.363
IS THERE A FILM,
OR A TELEVISION SERIES,

36:48.400 --> 36:49.867
THAT YOU PEOPLE
ACTUALLY SAW?

36:49.900 --> 36:51.834
- THE TOWN GETS TOGETHER
EVERY THURSDAY NIGHT

36:51.870 --> 36:53.462
TO WATCH
RERUNS OF EVERWOOD.

36:53.510 --> 36:54.932
- OKAY,
I CAN WORK WITH THAT.

36:54.980 --> 36:56.004
- WHAT HAPPENED NEXT?

36:56.040 --> 36:58.577
- SHE GOT MAD AT ME
FOR HURTING A BLIND PERSON.

36:58.610 --> 37:00.578
SHE THEN WENT
TO FIND HELP FOR JACK.

37:00.610 --> 37:01.941
I OFFERED
TO GO WITH HER,

37:01.980 --> 37:03.914
BUT SHE WANTED
NOTHING TO DO WITH ME.

37:03.950 --> 37:05.713
SO I TIED HIS
SHOELACES TOGETHER,

37:05.750 --> 37:09.618
AND WENT TO THE LIBRARY
AND WAITED TO HEAR FROM HER.

37:09.660 --> 37:15.348
OF COURSE...I NEVER DID.

37:15.400 --> 37:18.028
- JUST LIKE TREAT WILLIAMS'
CHARACTER ON EVERWOOD.

37:18.060 --> 37:19.322
NEVER GOT TO SAY
GOOD-BYE TO HIS WIFE.

37:19.370 --> 37:21.895
- SHAWN...SHAWN.

37:21.940 --> 37:23.396
- [sighs]

37:23.440 --> 37:25.567
LOOK, I'M TELLING
YOU GUYS THE TRUTH.

37:25.610 --> 37:27.669
PLUS, I HAVE AN ALIBI,
REMEMBER?

37:27.710 --> 37:30.679
- ALL RIGHT.

37:30.710 --> 37:32.007
BUT WE'RE ON TO YOU, RANDY.

37:32.050 --> 37:34.678
JUST LIKE THE TOWNSPEOPLE OF
EVERWOOD WERE ON TO THE FACT

37:34.720 --> 37:36.278
THAT NINA WAS
A SURROGATE MOTHER.

37:36.320 --> 37:37.947
- WILL YOU STOP IT?
- ENOUGH.

37:37.980 --> 37:41.518
- SHE WAS.

37:41.560 --> 37:44.859
- THANK YOU.

37:44.890 --> 37:47.279
- SO WHO DO WE THINK
RANDY'S EX IS?

37:47.330 --> 37:48.854
- JULES, YOU GOTTA
ORDER A PIECE OF THIS PIE.

37:48.900 --> 37:49.889
- I DID.

37:49.930 --> 37:51.522
YOU GUYS
IMMEDIATELY ATE IT.

37:51.570 --> 37:53.458
- WELL, IT'S GOTTA BE SOMEONE
WHO'S INTO THE CREEPSTERS,

37:53.500 --> 37:55.968
BUT I'M GUESSING SHE'S OLDER,
'CAUSE I HAVE YET TO SEE A WOMAN

37:56.000 --> 37:58.332
UNDER THE AGE OF 35
IN THIS TOWN.

37:58.370 --> 37:59.962
- IT'S ALSO SOMEONE THAT RANDY
SPENDS CONSISTENT TIME WITH.

38:00.010 --> 38:02.274
- MM-HMM, MM-HMM.

38:04.650 --> 38:05.776
I'M GETTING SOMETHING.

38:05.810 --> 38:07.573
- I'M AT THE LIBRARY
ALMOST EVERY NIGHT.

38:07.610 --> 38:11.341
- RANDY AND I HAVE A VERY
SPECIAL BOND, YOU SEE.

38:11.390 --> 38:13.847
- FOUR SLICES TO GO, PLEASE.

38:13.890 --> 38:17.587
- IF MAUDETTE WAS SLEEPING
WITH RANDY, THAT'S GROSS.

38:17.620 --> 38:18.882
SHE PRACTICALLY
RAISED HIM.

38:18.930 --> 38:20.329
- THE ONLY THING THAT
WOULD MAKE IT GROSSER

38:20.360 --> 38:21.588
IS IF SHE
WASN'T ATTRACTIVE.

38:21.630 --> 38:22.756
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

38:22.800 --> 38:25.667
THIS GOES BEYOND MAUDETTE
GETTING HER PAMELA SMART ON.

38:25.700 --> 38:27.327
I THINK SHE KILLED PAULA.

38:27.370 --> 38:28.462
- WHAT?
- HOW DO YOU FIGURE?

38:28.500 --> 38:30.798
- I'M SENSING THAT RANDY WENT TO
THE LIBRARY THAT NIGHT

38:30.840 --> 38:31.807
TO FINALLY TELL MAUDETTE

38:31.840 --> 38:34.536
THAT HE AND PAULA
WERE LEAVING DUAL SPIRES.

38:34.580 --> 38:36.468
SENT HER
INTO A JEALOUS RAGE.

38:36.510 --> 38:38.569
SHE SNUCK OUT,
KILLED PAULA,

38:38.610 --> 38:39.804
BECAUSE IF SHE
COULDN'T HAVE RANDY,

38:39.850 --> 38:41.579
NO WOMAN WOULD.

38:41.620 --> 38:42.712
- THAT CHANGES EVERYTHING.

38:42.750 --> 38:46.049
REMIND ME TO NEVER HAVE
AN AFFAIR WITH AN OLDER WOMAN

38:46.090 --> 38:47.978
OR A LIBRARIAN.

38:48.020 --> 38:50.113
- MAUDETTE.

38:50.160 --> 38:52.458
THAT'S NO GOOD.

38:52.490 --> 38:53.457
- OH.

38:53.490 --> 38:55.629
- I AM SO SICK OF THIS TOWN.

38:57.900 --> 39:00.892
- GO AHEAD AND WHEEL HER AROUND
THE CORNER TO MY OFFICE.

39:10.640 --> 39:13.643
- I CAN'T BELIEVE
MAUDETTE HORNSBY

39:13.680 --> 39:16.046
WAS TAKING ADVANTAGE
OF MY SON.

39:16.080 --> 39:18.617
- TAKING ADVANTAGE
IS A LITTLE STRONG.

39:18.650 --> 39:21.141
THE DUDE WAS 17
AND SHE WAS FINE.

39:21.190 --> 39:23.158
- WHAT EXACTLY CONSTITUTES
THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN

39:23.190 --> 39:25.579
ALTAR BOY GUS
AND DEGENERATE GUS?

39:25.630 --> 39:27.848
- REPUTATION WAS
EVERYTHING TO MAUDETTE.

39:27.890 --> 39:30.120
THE PROSPECT OF THE TOWN
KNOWING ABOUT THAT SCANDAL

39:30.160 --> 39:32.492
WAS PROBABLY MORE
THAN SHE COULD LIVE WITH.

39:32.530 --> 39:34.395
- I BETTER SPEAK TO MY BOY.

39:34.440 --> 39:38.035
- AND I'LL GET ON
THAT AUTOPSY.

39:38.070 --> 39:39.469
- THE FACT THAT
SHE MURDERED SOMEONE

39:39.510 --> 39:41.569
MAY HAVE ALSO
HURT HER REPUTATION.

39:41.610 --> 39:43.475
- ALL RIGHT, I'M GONNA GET
BACK AND BRIEF THE DEPARTMENT.

39:43.510 --> 39:44.477
DO YOU WANT ME
TO DRIVE YOU TO YOUR CAR?

39:44.510 --> 39:45.602
- NO.
- YES.

39:45.650 --> 39:47.709
- WE'LL MEET YOU
BACK THERE IN A BIT.

39:47.750 --> 39:49.547
- OKAY.

39:49.580 --> 39:50.774
- WHY ARE WE NOT GETTING
THE HELL OUT OF HERE?

39:50.820 --> 39:52.481
- BECAUSE MY THEORY
IS HALF-BAKED, GUS.

39:52.520 --> 39:54.579
SOMETHING ISN'T
SITTING RIGHT WITH ME.

39:54.620 --> 39:56.156
- YOU KNOW WHAT'S NOT SITTING
RIGHT WITH ME, SHAWN?

39:56.190 --> 39:58.624
BEING STUCK IN A TINY TOWN
WITH NO PHONE ACCESS

39:58.660 --> 39:59.684
AND ALL WHITE PEOPLE.

39:59.730 --> 40:01.527
LET'S GO.

40:03.000 --> 40:06.891
NOW WHERE ARE YOU GOING?

40:08.700 --> 40:10.861
IF WE LEAVE NOW,
I'LL LET YOU PLAY THE THEME

40:10.900 --> 40:11.935
TO WEIRD SCIENCE
OVER AND OVER IN THE CAR.

40:11.970 --> 40:13.904
WHAT DO YOU SAY?

40:13.940 --> 40:16.534
- THAT'S HAPPENING REGARDLESS.
THIS WAY.

40:24.850 --> 40:28.752
- HERE IS THE MOST RECENT
DUAL SPIRES YEARBOOK.

40:28.790 --> 40:30.610
- THE SENDER IS
ME@UNDERTHENAIL.COM.

40:30.660 --> 40:32.457
- MAUDETTE WAS
THE ONE EMAILING US.

40:32.490 --> 40:33.525
- THAT MAKES NO SENSE.

40:33.560 --> 40:35.699
WHY WOULD THE KILLER LURE
DETECT IVES TO THE SCENE

40:35.730 --> 40:37.049
AND THEN START
FEEDING THEM CLUES?

40:37.100 --> 40:40.194
- BECAUSE SHE
DIDN'T KILL PAULA, GUS.

40:40.230 --> 40:42.892
- I'M NEVER
GONNA LEAVE THIS TOWN.

40:42.940 --> 40:44.089
- SHE SUSPECTED FOUL PLAY

40:44.140 --> 40:45.232
AND KNEW SHE'D BE
THE PRIME SUSPECT

40:45.270 --> 40:47.602
IF ANYONE FOUND OUT ABOUT HER
RELATIONSHIP WITH RANDY.

40:47.640 --> 40:49.608
SO SHE STARTED SNOOPING AROUND
ON HER OWN,

40:49.640 --> 40:50.402
DISCOVERED THE DROWNING

40:50.440 --> 40:51.998
SEVEN YEARS AGO
IN SANTA BARBARA.

40:52.050 --> 40:53.938
FOUND US
ON THE INTERNET.

40:53.980 --> 40:55.242
- SO WHO KILLED PAULA MERRAL?

40:55.280 --> 40:59.546
- I DON'T KNOW,
BUT WE'RE GONNA FIND OUT.

41:02.760 --> 41:03.988
GUS, STOP MESSING AROUND.

41:04.020 --> 41:05.624
- I'M NOT, SHAWN.

41:05.660 --> 41:08.151
[crackling]

41:08.190 --> 41:09.828
SHAWN?
- YES, GUS.

41:09.860 --> 41:11.566
- SOMETHING'S BURNING.

41:11.600 --> 41:13.727
- I SEE THAT.

41:13.770 --> 41:16.068
HELP US!
SOMEBODY HELP US.

41:16.100 --> 41:18.068
WE'RE STUCK IN THIS TINY ROOM!
HELP US!

41:18.100 --> 41:19.237
- LET US OUT!

41:22.940 --> 41:24.646
- SHAWN, WE'RE GONNA DIE IN THIS
TINY, STUPID ROOM.

41:24.680 --> 41:27.274
- GUS, DON'T BE THE SCREAM
FROM HOLDING BACK THE YEARS.

41:27.310 --> 41:29.244
YOU'RE RIGHT, THOUGH.
THIS COULD BE IT FOR US.

41:29.280 --> 41:31.612
- MAN, WE ARE GONNA BURN!

41:31.650 --> 41:33.242
- YES, I KNOW.

41:41.830 --> 41:43.297
- NO, WAIT, WAIT!
WHO ARE YOU?

41:43.330 --> 41:47.164
[both screaming]

41:47.200 --> 41:49.839
- GUS!

41:58.710 --> 41:59.904
- FATHER WESTLEY.

41:59.950 --> 42:01.679
THANK GOD YOU
WERE HERE, LITERALLY.

42:01.720 --> 42:02.709
- WE WERE ABOUT
TO BE WICKER MEN.

42:02.750 --> 42:03.819
HOW DID YOU FIND US?

42:03.850 --> 42:05.044
- I JUST HAD FAITH.

42:05.090 --> 42:07.786
- REALLY?
- NO, BOYS.

42:07.820 --> 42:10.311
I JUST GOT TO TOWN,
AND I SAW THE FIRE.

42:10.360 --> 42:11.987
I SAW THE
TANDEM BICYCLE OUTSIDE.

42:12.030 --> 42:12.985
IT ALL ADDED UP.

42:13.030 --> 42:14.554
- BUT HOW DID YOU KNOW

42:14.600 --> 42:15.589
WE WERE IN TROUBLE
IN THE FIRST PLACE?

42:15.630 --> 42:16.528
- YOU HUNG UP ON ME

42:16.560 --> 42:17.652
WHEN I WAS TRANSCRIBING
THE LATIN, SHAWN.

42:17.700 --> 42:19.167
- I JUST--I GOT EXCITED.

42:19.200 --> 42:20.758
I TOOK ONE LITTLE STEP
TO THE LEFT.

42:20.800 --> 42:22.062
- AND THAT GIRL, PAULA.

42:22.100 --> 42:23.192
SHE FELT
SHE WAS IN DANGER.

42:23.240 --> 42:24.229
SHE WAS AFRAID.

42:24.270 --> 42:26.807
WHICH LED ME TO BE AFRAID
FOR THE TWO OF YOU.

42:26.840 --> 42:28.205
AND, HONESTLY,
I OWED YOU ONE ANYWAY

42:28.240 --> 42:30.333
BECAUSE OF THAT
WHOLE EXORCISM THING.

42:30.380 --> 42:32.940
- WHAT HAPPENED
TO YOUR HAIR?

42:32.980 --> 42:35.278
- OH...YEAH, IT WAS
AN ILL-ADVISED ATTEMPT

42:35.320 --> 42:38.619
TO COVER UP SOME GRAY
THAT WENT TERRIBLY AWRY.

42:38.650 --> 42:42.654
BUT TECH NICALLY,
SISTER RITA'S TO BLAME.

42:42.690 --> 42:44.248
SHE'S THE ONE
THAT DID MY HAIR.

42:44.290 --> 42:46.758
[car honking]

42:46.790 --> 42:49.020
- GUYS, GET IN.
WE DON'T HAVE MUCH TIME.

42:49.060 --> 42:50.027
- YOU HAVE A CAR?
WHAT GIVES?

42:50.060 --> 42:51.288
- WHY SHOULD WE
TRUST YOU?

42:51.330 --> 42:52.922
- YOU PROBABLY SHOULDN'T,
BUT IF YOU STAY HERE

42:52.970 --> 42:54.096
YOU'RE GONNA BE SITTING DUCKS
FOR WHOEVER IT WAS

42:54.130 --> 42:55.267
WHO TRIED
TO BURN YOU GUYS ALIVE.

42:55.300 --> 42:56.733
JUST--I'LL EXPLAIN
EVERYTHING AT THE CABIN.

42:56.770 --> 42:58.328
GET IN.

43:12.990 --> 43:16.778
HAVE A SEAT,
I'LL MAKE A FIRE.

43:16.820 --> 43:20.722
- ALL RIGHT,
WE'RE LISTENING.

43:20.760 --> 43:22.352
- MY GREAT GRANDFATHER
FOUNDED DUAL SPIRES.

43:22.400 --> 43:25.927
THAT'S HIM THERE.

43:25.970 --> 43:27.119
- I MIGHT HAVE
GUESSED THAT ONE.

43:27.170 --> 43:29.161
- AFTER WORLD WAR I ENDED,

43:29.200 --> 43:32.203
AND SEEING
THE ABSOLUTE WORST IN MAN,

43:32.240 --> 43:33.798
HE DECIDED TO SETTLE HERE

43:33.840 --> 43:35.034
WITH TWO OTHER SOLDIERS
FROM HIS SQUADRON

43:35.080 --> 43:36.172
AND THEIR FAMILIES.

43:36.210 --> 43:37.802
- I WAS WRONG,
IT ISN'T WITNESS.

43:37.840 --> 43:39.239
THIS IS THE VILLAGE.

43:39.280 --> 43:41.043
- THE VILLAGE
WAS A RIDICULOUS FILM.

43:41.080 --> 43:42.741
"THOSE WE
DO NOT SPEAK OF."

43:42.780 --> 43:44.748
REMEMBER ALL THAT NONSENSE?

43:44.790 --> 43:46.018
- IT'S ALWAYS BEEN
THE RESPONSIBILITY

43:46.050 --> 43:47.881
OF THE THREE LEADERS
OF THE FAMILIES

43:47.920 --> 43:50.013
TO WATCH OVER THE TOWN
AND ITS BEST INTERESTS.

43:50.060 --> 43:52.779
TRY TO UNDERSTAND,

43:52.830 --> 43:55.128
THEIR INTENTIONS WERE SO PURE.

43:55.160 --> 43:57.355
CREATE A COMMUNITY
THAT WOULDN'T BE SUBJECTED

43:57.400 --> 44:00.392
TO THE HORRORS
THAT THEY LIVED THROUGH.

44:00.430 --> 44:01.931
AND IT WORKED
FOR 40 YEARS.

44:01.970 --> 44:04.188
DUAL SPIRES
WAS PERFECT, UNTIL--

44:04.240 --> 44:07.004
- THE GREAT
SAWMILL FIRE OF '58.

44:15.350 --> 44:17.375
- IT WAS ARSON.

44:17.420 --> 44:18.842
A DRIFTER,

44:18.890 --> 44:20.915
WHO HAD BEEN IN TOWN
DOING ODD JOBS.

44:20.950 --> 44:23.453
EIGHT PEOPLE BURNED TO DEATH.

44:23.490 --> 44:26.721
AFTER THAT,
WE BECAME INSULATED.

44:26.760 --> 44:28.694
LOOKED AT ALL OUTSIDERS
AS A THREAT.

44:28.730 --> 44:31.119
- LIKE PAULA.
SHE WAS AFRAID.

44:31.160 --> 44:32.468
SHE THOUGHT
SHE WAS BEING WATCHED.

44:32.500 --> 44:34.229
EVEN FOLLOWED.
- SHE WAS.

44:34.270 --> 44:36.238
WHICH IS WHY
MICHELLE AND I WERE

44:36.270 --> 44:38.192
SUPPORTIVE
OF HER DECISION TO LEAVE.

44:38.240 --> 44:42.870
I...WE...LOVED HER SO MUCH.

44:42.910 --> 44:46.971
WE JUST WANTED HER
TO BE HAPPY.

44:49.520 --> 44:52.284
- DID PAULA EVER KNOW
THAT YOU WERE HER FATHER?

44:54.820 --> 44:57.209
- YES.

44:57.260 --> 44:58.409
I HAD TO TELL HER,
IN ORDER TO GET HER

44:58.460 --> 44:59.825
TO COME HERE
IN THE FIRST PLACE.

44:59.860 --> 45:01.919
- WHAT ABOUT YOUR WIFE?

45:01.960 --> 45:04.190
DID SHE KNOW YOU HAD
AN AFFAIR WITH HER SISTER?

45:04.230 --> 45:05.458
- NO.

45:05.500 --> 45:07.195
SHE NEVER WILL.

45:07.230 --> 45:09.994
I THINK SHE'S
BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH.

45:10.040 --> 45:11.962
- YOU KNOW, FOR A TOWN
THAT PRIDES ITSELF

45:12.010 --> 45:13.762
ON HONESTY
AND DO-GOODEDNESS,

45:13.810 --> 45:15.334
YOU ALL HAVE A LOT OF
SKELETONS IN YOUR CLOSET.

45:15.380 --> 45:18.338
- JUDGE NOT,
THAT YE MAY BE JUDGED, GUS.

45:18.380 --> 45:20.746
ALTHOUGH, I MUST SAY,
IN THIS CASE,

45:20.780 --> 45:23.271
IT'S PRETTY MESSED UP.

45:28.150 --> 45:29.981
- I KNOW WHO
KILLED PAULA MERRAL.

45:32.230 --> 45:34.118
[door opens]

45:34.160 --> 45:35.388
- SHERIFF,
YOU CAN PUT THE GUN DOWN.

45:35.430 --> 45:37.125
THIS IS FATHER WESTLEY.
HE SAVED US.

45:37.160 --> 45:39.321
- MY HAIR DOESN'T
NORMALLY LOOK LIKE THIS.

45:39.370 --> 45:41.930
- BLESS ME FATHER,
FOR I HAVE SINNED.

45:41.970 --> 45:44.291
BUT I'M AFRAID
I CAN'T PUT AWAY THIS GUN.

45:44.340 --> 45:47.503
- NO, I SUPPOSE YOU CAN'T.

45:47.540 --> 45:48.939
YOU SEE,
THE OTHER TWO FAMILIES

45:48.980 --> 45:50.936
THAT SETTLED THIS TOWN
WERE THE JACKSONS

45:50.980 --> 45:53.403
AND THE GOODENS,
AM I RIGHT?

45:53.450 --> 45:57.045
AND AS ITS OTHER TWO LEADERS,
YOU PANICKED

45:57.080 --> 46:00.516
WHEN YOU CAUGHT WIND
THAT THE EVIL PAULA

46:00.550 --> 46:02.154
WAS RUNNING AWAY
WITH RANDY.

46:02.190 --> 46:03.987
I MEAN,
WITHOUT THE CINNAMON KING,

46:04.020 --> 46:06.488
WHO WOULD LEAD
OVER FUTURE GENERATIONS?

46:06.530 --> 46:10.227
THE GOOD DOCTOR
CAN'T CONCEIVE.

46:10.260 --> 46:12.194
THE BARKERS DIDN'T HAVE
A CHILD OF THEIR OWN,

46:12.230 --> 46:14.937
WHICH MEANS RANDY IS
THE ONLY DIRECT DESCENDENT

46:14.970 --> 46:17.962
TO PROTECT DUAL SPIRES
AND YOUR WAY OF LIFE.

46:18.000 --> 46:21.299
ESPECIALLY NOW THAT
THE SHERIFF IS DYING OF CANCER.

46:21.340 --> 46:24.571
- I KNOW HE'S HURTING,
BUT HE WON'T TALK TO ME.

46:24.610 --> 46:27.078
- THE TWO OF YOU WIELDED
ALL THE POWER NECESSARY

46:27.110 --> 46:29.840
TO KILL PAULA AND MAKE IT
LOOK LIKE AN ACCIDENT.

46:29.880 --> 46:31.848
AND YOU WOULD HAVE
GOTTEN AWAY WITH IT TOO,

46:31.890 --> 46:34.245
IF MAUDETTE HADN'T
SENT THOSE EMAILS.

46:34.290 --> 46:36.315
BUT EVEN THAT WAS NOTHING

46:36.360 --> 46:37.816
A LITTLE ROPE
COULDN'T TAKE CARE OF.

46:37.860 --> 46:39.259
ISN'T THAT RIGHT, SHERIFF?

46:39.290 --> 46:41.451
- YOU TRULY ARE AMAZING.

46:41.490 --> 46:43.822
BUT YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE
COME HERE.

46:43.860 --> 46:45.498
OUR BUSINESS
WAS NOT YOUR CONCERN.

46:45.530 --> 46:48.226
- YOUR BUSINESS...
IS MURDER.

46:48.270 --> 46:50.192
- HER DEATH,
THOUGH TRAGIC,

46:50.240 --> 46:53.107
SAVES OUR FUTURE.

46:53.140 --> 46:54.937
- YOU KILLED
MY LITTLE GIRL.

46:54.980 --> 46:57.608
- UM, WHAT ABOUT US?

46:57.640 --> 47:00.438
- HONESTLY,
FAR LESS TRAGIC.

47:00.480 --> 47:03.017
WE BARELY KNOW YOU.

47:03.050 --> 47:05.484
- I'M IN MY OWN
SPECIAL CATEGORY.

47:05.520 --> 47:06.589
RIGHT?

47:06.620 --> 47:09.054
- REALLY, FATHER?

47:09.090 --> 47:10.352
- FREEZE!

47:10.390 --> 47:12.984
- DROP IT, NOW.

47:13.030 --> 47:14.349
- HOW DID YOU FIND US?

47:14.390 --> 47:16.620
- AW, MIRACLES HAPPEN
EVERY DAY, GUS.

47:16.660 --> 47:18.321
- THIS IS A MIRACLE?

47:18.360 --> 47:21.067
- NO, I CALLED THE DETECT IVES
BEFORE I CAME TO TOWN.

47:21.100 --> 47:24.194
- YOU SLY OLD DOG.

47:24.240 --> 47:26.606
- WE RAN INTO JACK,
AND HE LED US HERE.

47:26.640 --> 47:29.029
- THEY THOUGHT
THIS PLACE WAS A SECRET.

47:29.080 --> 47:31.332
I'VE PHOTOGRAPHED EVERY SINGLE
INCH OF THIS TOWN.

47:31.380 --> 47:33.405

47:33.450 --> 47:36.317
WE'RE OVER HERE.

HAVE SOME ALONE TIME.

WE'RE NOT REALLY ALONE, SHAWN.

ABOUT THE PIE, BURTON.

IT'S HEAVENLY.
- RIGHT?

48:16.360 --> 48:17.918
NOW ON TO ECCLESIASTES.

48:17.960 --> 48:19.450
- IT'S ONE OF MY FAVORITES.
- HMM?

48:19.490 --> 48:21.958
- COULDN'T BLOW OFF A PRIEST.
I'M PRETTY SURE THAT'S A SIN.

FATHER WESTLEY, AND CARLTON.

CUP OF CIDER.

PLEASE.
