WEBVTT

00:05.720 --> 00:07.240
Previously on "Graves"...

00:07.320 --> 00:09.240
Just ask for your job back already.

00:09.320 --> 00:12.240
- I'd like to come back.
- And vote Thomas Nash for Senate.

00:12.320 --> 00:13.600
This man is a disease.

00:13.680 --> 00:17.080
Martin Treadwell, the would-be assassin
of former President Richard Graves,

00:17.160 --> 00:21.000
has been granted a weekend furlough
in order to visit his dying mother.

00:21.080 --> 00:23.560
I've been waiting a long time for this.

00:23.640 --> 00:26.120
RPAC summit is inviting
you back again this year.

00:26.200 --> 00:27.880
They're giving you
the Reagan Award, sir.

00:27.960 --> 00:30.520
I'm gonna announce
my Senate candidacy at RPAC.

00:31.200 --> 00:32.759
There's a dead man in the living room !

00:32.840 --> 00:35.360
- We've got to go.
- Wait. His phone.

00:36.120 --> 00:37.480
Sammy, I like you.

00:37.680 --> 00:40.440
- We're never gonna be together.
- Fuck you.

00:40.520 --> 00:43.080
You belong here, Jeremy.
Your own half-hour show.

00:43.160 --> 00:44.360
Okay.

00:44.600 --> 00:46.160
- Maggie.
- I can't.

00:46.240 --> 00:48.160
This is Erin York with "USA Today"

00:48.240 --> 00:51.280
regarding the affair between
Margaret Graves and Jonathan Dalton

00:51.360 --> 00:52.760
when she was in the White House.

00:52.840 --> 00:53.840
What ?

01:00.680 --> 01:02.920
- Have you told the president ?
- No, ma'am.

01:03.000 --> 01:06.240
The reporter called late last night
and I came straight to you this morning.

01:06.320 --> 01:08.480
Good.
I appreciate that.

01:09.280 --> 01:11.280
I'll tell Richard
after the RPAC convention.

01:11.360 --> 01:15.200
I don't want to worry him on his
big day. It's between he and I.

01:15.640 --> 01:17.440
Of course, ma'am.

01:19.960 --> 01:23.320
- What is it, Ramona ?
- Mr. Graves is looking for Isaiah.

01:23.720 --> 01:26.520
- All right, off you go.
- Okay.

01:28.000 --> 01:34.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:48.440 --> 01:52.880
- Morning, sir.
- Good morning, Isaiah. Sit down.

01:53.720 --> 01:56.880
I want to bend your ear for a minute.

01:57.120 --> 02:01.000
I've been thinking.
The last few months for me,

02:01.080 --> 02:06.160
well, have been kind of a delayed
mid-life crisis of sorts.

02:06.480 --> 02:10.199
I wouldn't call it a crisis, sir.
An exploration, maybe.

02:10.560 --> 02:16.560
I need to put my estate in order,
tie up loose ends,

02:17.280 --> 02:19.800
and make my peace with it,
don't you think ?

02:20.040 --> 02:23.200
Yeah, that would be the conventional
wisdom for someone your age,

02:23.280 --> 02:26.000
but things have been
so unconventional for so long.

02:26.080 --> 02:27.400
Are you sure you're okay ?

02:27.480 --> 02:32.000
I've got to put the past to bed
now that Margaret's really running.

02:32.720 --> 02:35.280
There's something else
I need from you.

02:35.840 --> 02:40.400
- Okay.
- Write my acceptance speech.

02:40.880 --> 02:42.720
Really ?

02:44.560 --> 02:48.160
- For your RPAC award ?
- Something the party faithful can love.

02:48.240 --> 02:49.960
Give them classic Graves,

02:50.480 --> 02:54.360
some of that red meat crap
that made you want to be me.

02:54.880 --> 02:56.760
I'd be honored, sir.

02:57.320 --> 03:01.160
Today is all about Richard Graves
up and down the line.

03:01.800 --> 03:04.920
I'm outside the yearly
Republican Political Action Conference,

03:05.000 --> 03:08.600
where luminaries and political
junkies from across the nation

03:08.680 --> 03:10.760
will gather over the next three days.

03:10.840 --> 03:12.520
The conference has come to Santa Fe

03:12.600 --> 03:16.400
to honor New Mexico's favorite son
former President Richard Graves,

03:16.480 --> 03:19.040
who will receive the annual
Ronald Reagan Award

03:19.120 --> 03:23.000
in recognition of his lifetime
of leadership in the Republican party,

03:23.080 --> 03:25.960
with his wife,
former First Lady Margaret Graves,

03:26.040 --> 03:27.920
giving the night's keynote.

03:41.600 --> 03:45.040
Mortuary transfer will be here
in a couple hours. Time to go.

03:47.000 --> 03:50.760
- You hear me, Treadwell ?
- Yes, I heard you.

03:51.680 --> 03:53.760
It's time to go.

04:25.520 --> 04:27.720
GRAVES
Episode 10

04:37.640 --> 04:40.120
President Graves !

04:43.440 --> 04:45.320
President Graves !

04:54.720 --> 04:57.440
I'd be lying if I told you
I wasn't nervous as hell.

04:59.840 --> 05:06.640
It's going to be great, Maggie.
Honey, you're gonna be fantastic.

05:06.960 --> 05:08.880
I love seeing you like this.

05:08.960 --> 05:12.080
- Like what ?
- Like my husband. I've missed you.

05:17.960 --> 05:21.760
Hi. How are you ?
Nice to see you.

05:49.880 --> 05:53.280
This Dalton affair piece now ?
It's really not good.

05:53.360 --> 05:56.480
- Oh, no, do you think so ?
- What do you want me to say ?

05:56.560 --> 05:59.000
They're accusing her of having
an affair with Dalton 25 years ago.

05:59.080 --> 06:01.240
Am I supposed to stand here
and pretend it's not happening ?

06:01.320 --> 06:03.360
That's what I said to my first boyfriend.
It worked.

06:03.440 --> 06:07.360
Maggie, some good news. Just hung up
with a source at "USA Today."

06:07.560 --> 06:10.560
Got a heads up that this
reporter Erin York is here

06:10.920 --> 06:12.920
roaming the event trying
to get a statement.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.200
Tell me that's not true.

06:14.280 --> 06:17.440
If she's here fishing, it means
she doesn't have what she needs yet.

06:17.520 --> 06:21.160
Also, my source confirmed
that nothing's breaking for two days.

06:21.240 --> 06:22.240
And when it does ?

06:22.320 --> 06:24.920
It will be after you announce,
and we'll deny the hell out of it.

06:25.000 --> 06:27.720
An old left-wing rumor
that's been circulating for decades.

06:27.800 --> 06:29.200
- One of many.
- There you go, hon.

06:29.280 --> 06:31.800
Now you're playing it.
Dancing the dance.

06:32.120 --> 06:36.160
Maggie, does the president
know about this Dalton piece ?

06:36.320 --> 06:41.040
- No. No one's gonna tell him but me.
- What about Jeremy and Livy ?

06:43.320 --> 06:46.760
I'm Jeremy Graves, and it doesn't
get more exciting than this.

06:46.840 --> 06:49.280
'Cause this Saturday and every Saturday,

06:49.360 --> 06:52.880
I'm breaking into your house
for a painful dose of the truth.

06:53.160 --> 06:54.960
Deal with it, America.

06:55.360 --> 06:56.720
And we're out.

06:58.520 --> 07:01.200
I want you on our air
as soon as fucking possible.

07:01.720 --> 07:04.120
This is too much, man.
I'd call it a dream come true

07:04.200 --> 07:07.120
if I ever allowed myself to dream
this big, which I never did.

07:07.200 --> 07:08.880
To be honest with you,
I kind of just saw my future

07:08.960 --> 07:11.640
as, like, an endless
succession of rehabs

07:11.720 --> 07:15.720
and manic depression
and spending my trust fund.

07:15.960 --> 07:18.280
But the show, it's great.
It's nuts, you know ?

07:18.360 --> 07:19.840
- You're nuts !
- Right.

07:19.920 --> 07:23.960
Obviously near clinical, and let's find
a way to keep you in that space.

07:24.560 --> 07:25.720
- Remember.
- Yeah ?

07:26.240 --> 07:29.040
Unhappy is your brand.
Misery begets ratings.

07:29.120 --> 07:31.400
Right, but maybe we could
lighten it up every once in...

07:31.480 --> 07:33.160
I hear your father's
gonna be at the summit.

07:33.240 --> 07:34.720
Yeah, I'm heading there
right after this.

07:34.800 --> 07:38.240
Do me a favor. Take notes.
Our first episode will write itself.

07:46.000 --> 07:49.560
Agents Hill and O'Leary, ma'am.
FBI Albuquerque field office.

07:49.640 --> 07:51.360
We're looking for Jeremy Graves.

07:51.440 --> 07:53.680
We have a couple questions
for him about Arturo Del Rey.

07:53.760 --> 07:55.880
- Fuck.
- Yes, come in, please.

08:00.200 --> 08:01.200
Hey, Livy.

08:01.280 --> 08:02.800
- Uncle Jacob.
- What's going on ?

08:02.880 --> 08:04.400
We need your help.

08:05.680 --> 08:07.440
Hello, friend. How are you ?

08:08.240 --> 08:11.360
Okay, and, sir, you just have that lunch
with your former White House cabinet.

08:11.440 --> 08:14.000
Did you finish the speech
yet for tonight ?

08:14.960 --> 08:19.960
- Almost, sir. Just polishing.
- It better be great, Isaiah.

08:20.200 --> 08:24.400
Because this is probably the last
time I'll ever speak to this crowd,

08:24.880 --> 08:27.760
so it's the final chapter.

08:29.000 --> 08:32.880
The last moment
in the chapter, all right ?

08:33.280 --> 08:34.840
- Okay.
- All right.

08:36.240 --> 08:38.559
- I'll catch up to you later.
- Okay.

08:38.840 --> 08:42.200
Finish the speech, young man.

08:55.360 --> 08:58.000
So, you're sitting down with the
Daughters of the American Revolution,

08:58.080 --> 09:00.920
but just remember that you're a woman
conservative men want to sleep with

09:01.000 --> 09:02.960
and Republican women want to be.

09:03.640 --> 09:05.560
- Okay.
- First Lady...

09:06.320 --> 09:09.640
- Mr. Nash. So nice to see you.
- Nice ?

09:10.560 --> 09:15.400
Is it really nice ?
Come on, announce already, will you ?

09:15.720 --> 09:21.440
Jeez, I am literally just itching out
of my skin waiting to tussle with you.

09:21.720 --> 09:23.680
Patience, Mr. Nash.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.840
- Margaret.
- Chet.

09:25.920 --> 09:28.000
- Y'all know Chet Whitaker.
- Of course.

09:28.080 --> 09:30.720
And, by the way, I used
your Southern colloquial "y'all"

09:30.800 --> 09:33.680
since Chet here has agreed
to back my primary campaign.

09:33.760 --> 09:35.520
So, we're sort of family now.

09:35.600 --> 09:38.400
You've really got your hands
full with this one, Chet.

09:38.880 --> 09:41.960
I think he thinks the sun comes
up just to hear him crow.

09:42.600 --> 09:44.560
Cock-a-doodle-doo.

09:48.000 --> 09:49.680
- Damn it.
- It's okay.

09:49.760 --> 09:52.680
- Forget about Whitaker's blood money.
- Sure, let's forget about it.

09:52.760 --> 09:54.240
That is a great attitude, Lawrence.

09:54.320 --> 09:56.280
It's better than pouting
about things beyond your control.

09:56.360 --> 09:58.120
- I am not pouting.
- My God.

09:58.200 --> 10:00.160
The two of you need to stop this.

10:00.240 --> 10:04.920
Whatever the hell is going on, you need
to fix it, or find another candidate.

10:05.520 --> 10:07.440
This better all be worth it.

10:21.320 --> 10:23.640
Liv, hey. You should
have seen my show set.

10:23.720 --> 10:25.400
- It is so...
- Shut the fuck up.

10:25.480 --> 10:27.320
- Come here.
- What ?

10:30.360 --> 10:33.920
- Who are the suits ?
- FB fucking I.

10:34.200 --> 10:36.960
Oh, shit.
Whatever, you didn't do anything.

10:37.040 --> 10:39.640
No, they don't want to talk to me.
They want to talk to you.

10:39.720 --> 10:41.040
Me ? What the fuck ?

10:41.120 --> 10:43.960
- You fucking kidding ?
- What the hell did you two do ?

10:47.120 --> 10:50.520
Can you tell us where you were
the first of December, Mr. Graves ?

10:51.920 --> 10:55.360
The first ?
I was on a plane for a good portion.

10:55.440 --> 10:59.680
I was back and forth to Los Angeles
for a business meeting.

10:59.880 --> 11:01.280
Do you know this man ?

11:03.760 --> 11:06.240
- No.
- You've never seen him before ?

11:06.920 --> 11:08.560
His name's Arturo Del Rey.

11:08.640 --> 11:11.880
Drug dealer. Pretty high up the chain
of a cartel out of Juarez.

11:11.960 --> 11:15.760
Been slipping out of the country
for years. He was recently murdered.

11:16.000 --> 11:18.080
Why don't we get to what this
has to do with Jeremy ?

11:18.160 --> 11:19.160
Love that.

11:19.240 --> 11:21.920
A hair matching Mr. Graves' paternal
DNA

11:22.000 --> 11:25.720
luck on the hit since the entire former
first family's records are on file

11:25.800 --> 11:27.200
was found at the apartment.

11:27.280 --> 11:30.560
That and a partial fingerprint
on a can of spray paint.

11:30.880 --> 11:33.920
So, we can't verify it,
but the coincidence...

11:34.240 --> 11:38.040
We should also mention Del Rey
was on this property not too long ago.

11:40.280 --> 11:41.280
Is something funny ?

11:41.360 --> 11:44.160
No, I'm sorry. I just realized
where you're going with this.

11:44.240 --> 11:46.440
So, you're telling me that this
guy was here on the ranch

11:46.520 --> 11:48.800
with the hundreds of other
undocumented workers

11:48.880 --> 11:50.560
who pitched a tent on our front lawn

11:50.640 --> 11:53.560
the same day that I got back
from a four-year tour in Afghanistan ?

11:53.640 --> 11:54.920
I do remember this guy.

11:55.000 --> 11:57.040
Now that I think about it,
it's all coming back to me.

11:57.120 --> 12:00.640
Yeah, I believe we called him
Latino Male 127.

12:00.720 --> 12:02.040
Jeremy.

12:02.120 --> 12:05.680
I assure you, Mr. Graves,
he wasn't just a number.

12:08.160 --> 12:12.200
Del Rey was the son of Mexico's biggest
drug lord, El Torron.

12:12.280 --> 12:15.360
The guy was basically
a Mexican Rockefeller.

12:20.760 --> 12:24.240
Isaiah ? Erin York, "USA Today."
We met in DC.

12:24.320 --> 12:27.920
What are you doing here ?
I have nothing to say to you.

12:28.120 --> 12:32.200
I just want a comment from your boss
on the Dalton-Margaret Graves piece.

12:32.320 --> 12:33.880
Even a denial ?

12:43.240 --> 12:46.040
Hill here.
Just now ?

12:46.960 --> 12:50.240
They got a ping
on Arturo Del Rey's burner phone.

12:50.800 --> 12:55.080
Yes, get me the warrant.
Wait, where ?

13:03.560 --> 13:06.640
My God, a Mexican Rockefeller ?
Am I karma's bitch or what ?

13:06.720 --> 13:08.120
What are we gonna do ?

13:08.200 --> 13:11.000
Nothing. It's over.
It's got to be over.

13:11.080 --> 13:14.600
No, that is what everybody says
before people who be beefing

13:14.680 --> 13:16.520
get run up on and Glocked.

13:16.600 --> 13:19.480
Liv, I need you to stop
watching drug movies.

13:19.920 --> 13:22.840
- I'm fucking serious.
- It makes me feel close to him.

13:22.920 --> 13:24.840
Okay, look at me. You need
to pull your shit together

13:24.920 --> 13:27.040
'cause you're about to meet my potential
girlfriend at a time in my life

13:27.120 --> 13:29.200
where for once my
future isn't a black hole of shit

13:29.280 --> 13:31.080
and I'm not drowning
in uncertainty, okay ?

13:31.160 --> 13:32.520
And I can't let anything derail me.

13:32.600 --> 13:34.760
Not this family or your dead boyfriend.
Nothing.

13:34.840 --> 13:38.240
At the very least, I deserve
the illusion of hope, don't I ?

13:59.840 --> 14:03.520
- Hey, Iz.
- Sammy.

14:05.840 --> 14:08.720
You look so different.

14:09.280 --> 14:12.080
Not in a bad way.
I do not mean that in a bad way.

14:13.240 --> 14:16.600
- I know, crazy, right ?
- It's really good to see you.

14:18.040 --> 14:21.760
Yeah, it's good to see you, too.

14:24.440 --> 14:26.120
So what are you doing here ?

14:26.200 --> 14:28.720
The prez invited me
as his personal guest.

14:29.280 --> 14:32.840
Yeah, I guess he wanted me to hear
this speech you've been writing.

14:32.920 --> 14:33.920
Oh, yeah.

14:34.000 --> 14:36.000
He says it's gonna be
the best one he's ever given.

14:36.080 --> 14:39.080
Oh, no pressure there.

14:40.840 --> 14:43.840
It was nice to be invited.

14:46.640 --> 14:52.520
I'm sorry, Sammy. I'm so, so sorry.
I never wanted to hurt you.

14:54.520 --> 14:59.360
- But you did.
- I know. Believe me, I know.

15:01.120 --> 15:06.920
I really liked you.
You were kind and so sweet,

15:07.800 --> 15:12.560
and that's not something
I've not known too much of, you know ?

15:13.320 --> 15:19.720
And it was amazing how different
you were until you weren't.

15:24.920 --> 15:28.720
Anyway...
I'm leaving first thing in the morning.

15:30.000 --> 15:33.120
- Need a change of scenery.
- Oh, my God, really ?

15:35.640 --> 15:37.960
President Graves...

15:40.200 --> 15:43.600
Oh, shit. Oh, my God, the president.

15:43.680 --> 15:45.320
- Look, I have to go.
- Go.

15:45.400 --> 15:47.560
- We'll talk later ?
- Yes.

15:47.640 --> 15:50.360
- It's really good to see you.
- Just go.

16:08.640 --> 16:10.360
Ms. York, wait.

16:10.440 --> 16:12.600
Okay, listen, Isaiah,
I'm just trying to do my job.

16:12.680 --> 16:16.080
- You know you can't stop the story...
- She's a problem.

16:19.280 --> 16:21.280
- He's clear.
- Thank you.

16:24.880 --> 16:27.680
Then we're settled, Jonathan.

16:27.760 --> 16:30.760
Yes, we are, Richard,
and I'm glad it all worked out.

16:30.840 --> 16:33.000
Exactly like it was meant to.

16:33.200 --> 16:39.760
But before I forget,
stay the fuck away from my wife.

16:42.880 --> 16:45.120
What was that ?

16:55.600 --> 16:57.560
Thanks.

16:58.240 --> 17:03.120
Isaiah, Jonathan Dalton is going
to put up the money

17:03.640 --> 17:06.119
that'll run Maggie
through the primaries.

17:06.200 --> 17:10.200
Okay, but, sir, Jonathan Dalton
and Mrs. Graves...

17:11.160 --> 17:13.200
There's gonna be a news story, sir.

17:13.280 --> 17:17.400
Isaiah, I've known
about the affair forever.

17:19.160 --> 17:23.079
- We put it to bed a long time ago.
- What about the article ?

17:23.480 --> 17:29.040
If an article comes out, you deny it.
You think you can do that ?

17:29.400 --> 17:30.400
Okay.

17:30.480 --> 17:32.840
Now, come on,
I want to hear that speech.

17:33.320 --> 17:34.800
Right now ? Like, out loud ?

17:34.880 --> 17:38.600
Yes, out loud, so I can
digest what I have to say.

17:48.080 --> 17:50.480
All right, kid, let's hear it.

17:57.560 --> 18:01.080
Ladies and gentlemen,
it's an honor to be here.

18:03.320 --> 18:05.320
Henry David Thoreau wrote

18:05.680 --> 18:08.520
"We are constantly invited
to be who we are."

18:09.280 --> 18:14.040
Well, I was invited
and I accepted.

18:15.640 --> 18:18.920
But it's not whether or not
you show up that's important,

18:19.000 --> 18:21.520
it's what you bring to the party.

18:22.680 --> 18:24.600
For many years since I was president,

18:24.680 --> 18:27.440
there's been a lot of talk
about what I brought.

18:28.320 --> 18:30.480
Most of it not very flattering.

18:31.200 --> 18:34.040
And that'll really sting an old man
looking back at his legacy.

18:34.120 --> 18:40.760
But you know what ? That's okay.
It was on the invitation and I accepted.

18:42.360 --> 18:45.680
You see, recently I had
a profound epiphany of sorts.

18:46.280 --> 18:47.960
I woke up to the realization

18:48.760 --> 18:52.400
that I was too close to the end
to not start living.

18:53.800 --> 19:00.080
That if I...
we are to be mindful of our today,

19:00.600 --> 19:03.520
then we are duty-bound
to look at our yesterday.

19:03.720 --> 19:06.200
For while it may define
who we have become,

19:06.520 --> 19:12.000
the beauty of being alive
is the opportunity to rewrite our story

19:12.240 --> 19:14.280
with every single breath.

19:15.440 --> 19:20.600
And my story
is far from finished.

19:22.160 --> 19:24.720
There are still wrongs to be made right.

19:26.080 --> 19:31.000
So I'm not gonna put my past to bed
or settle my estate.

19:33.520 --> 19:38.000
I refuse to get into the backseat
of my life or fade away.

19:38.920 --> 19:43.400
There's more to do.
Good I could bring to the world.

19:44.200 --> 19:48.480
Light I could shine into
the darker recess of our lives.

19:49.480 --> 19:54.840
Value to being alive and having a voice.

19:57.640 --> 20:04.520
My journey, my mission,
has just begun.

20:05.720 --> 20:12.320
Because, ladies and gentlemen,
I was invited.

20:17.600 --> 20:19.720
And I accepted.

20:31.920 --> 20:33.840
Thank you.

20:40.200 --> 20:41.840
- Jeremy.
- Hey.

20:41.920 --> 20:44.720
- Holy shit. Hi.
- Hi.

20:50.920 --> 20:54.600
Your family things
are very different than mine.

20:54.680 --> 20:55.680
Thanks for coming.

20:55.760 --> 20:59.520
It's the furthest I've come for a second
date, so it better be worth it.

20:59.600 --> 21:03.680
Yeah, sorry. Liv, this is Tasha.
Tasha, this is my sister Olivia.

21:03.760 --> 21:05.360
Hi, it's so nice to meet you.

21:05.440 --> 21:08.240
So, your daddy kills
people with produce.

21:08.320 --> 21:10.320
- God damn it.
- Sorry. I'm sorry.

21:10.400 --> 21:13.320
I'm sorry. I'm just
no-filter space right now.

21:13.680 --> 21:15.520
Besides, baby brother
tells me everything.

21:15.600 --> 21:19.640
It's a long established pattern of
sibling oversharing that works for us.

21:19.720 --> 21:21.680
- Interesting.
- It isn't.

21:22.160 --> 21:25.480
That.
I really like that.

21:26.560 --> 21:30.280
- Good job. You can keep fucking her.
- Thanks. Hi.

21:31.360 --> 21:33.280
- Good to see me ?
- You have no idea.

21:33.360 --> 21:35.880
Please make your
way to the main ballroom.

21:58.880 --> 22:01.840
How are you ? Hi. Good to see you.

22:14.640 --> 22:18.800
Here is President Graves' speech.
Here you go.

22:19.320 --> 22:23.320
Erin, by the way,
do what you want with the affair story.

22:23.600 --> 22:25.800
Really, it's an old rumor anyway.

22:25.880 --> 22:28.120
- It'll never stick.
- Affair ?

22:28.400 --> 22:31.200
That's just the tip of the iceberg
for Margaret Graves.

22:31.640 --> 22:35.040
It's the result of the affair
that we're interested in.

22:37.280 --> 22:39.120
Result ?

22:46.960 --> 22:53.400
Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome
former First Lady Margaret Graves.

22:56.400 --> 22:59.600
Okay, fight the man, Maggie.

23:11.520 --> 23:14.840
Thank you.

23:16.000 --> 23:19.080
Thank you very much.

23:28.400 --> 23:30.280
What a treat this is.

23:30.360 --> 23:34.120
Today I get to stand on this stage
and talk about my favorite person.

23:34.800 --> 23:39.200
My partner, my heart,
the other half of me.

23:40.440 --> 23:45.400
He also happens to be your former
president, my husband Richard Graves.

23:55.040 --> 23:56.800
One thing you must know,

23:57.360 --> 24:02.240
what I am most proud of is that Richard
Graves didn't change for Washington.

24:02.600 --> 24:06.000
He demanded that Washington
change for him.

24:11.480 --> 24:13.960
Richard always stood up no matter what.

24:14.200 --> 24:17.280
He stood up for what he
believed and never wavered.

24:18.200 --> 24:21.120
When you spend your life
making the tough decisions

24:21.200 --> 24:24.440
that no one, and I mean no one,
wants to make,

24:25.200 --> 24:27.200
you become an easy target.

24:28.920 --> 24:34.520
My husband is my hero
because he demands that I stand up, too.

24:42.560 --> 24:44.800
My husband, your former president,

24:45.440 --> 24:51.160
granted me the gift of sharing his
moment to let you know here and now

24:51.320 --> 24:53.240
that I, Margaret Graves,

24:53.400 --> 24:56.560
am declaring my candidacy
for the United States Senate

24:56.640 --> 25:00.960
to represent the great state
of New  Mexico in our nation's capital !

25:08.200 --> 25:12.080
Okay, now, y'all stay on your feet
and help me get 'em out here...

25:12.240 --> 25:15.360
my lights, Olivia and Jeremy !

25:23.160 --> 25:28.200
And the 2016 Ronald Reagan
Lifetime Achievement Award recipient,

25:29.000 --> 25:32.840
my very own cowboy, Richard Graves !

26:34.440 --> 26:36.800
It will all be over now.

26:52.240 --> 26:57.800
Isaiah !
Oh, God ! Call an ambulance !

28:04.400 --> 28:07.360
End of season I

28:08.305 --> 28:14.825
