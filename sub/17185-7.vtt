36:46.746 --> 36:49.372
I never wanted you to see that tape.

36:52.126 --> 36:53.793
I was gonna destroy it.

36:56.839 --> 36:59.799
But since you did,
did you notice the date?

37:07.683 --> 37:09.768
The date on the tape?

37:10.019 --> 37:12.771
June 8, 1997.

37:13.314 --> 37:14.981
Do you know that date?

37:19.862 --> 37:21.529
I do now.

37:22.323 --> 37:24.324
It's the date you gave up
being my mother.

37:36.003 --> 37:38.421
It's the date I broke out of there.

37:39.799 --> 37:42.801
The day you came for me
I was coming for you.

37:47.932 --> 37:51.518
Because about three seconds
after I signed that paper...

37:52.186 --> 37:54.354
...I knew I couldn't live with it.

37:58.109 --> 38:01.569
I was coming for you
and I was gonna die trying.

38:05.866 --> 38:07.867
You almost did.

38:08.411 --> 38:10.453
So did you.

38:14.375 --> 38:16.876
And you were mad as hell about it.

38:19.255 --> 38:20.880
Yelled at me...

38:21.882 --> 38:23.967
...and told me
what a stupid move it was.

38:25.845 --> 38:28.388
I might have oversold that a little.

38:38.274 --> 38:46.573
I'll always find you.

38:48.909 --> 38:52.287
SARAH: There was a time
I was a hero to my son.

38:52.872 --> 38:54.581
He thought I walked on water.

38:55.666 --> 38:57.751
He knows better now.

39:06.761 --> 39:09.179
We all have weak moments...

39:09.805 --> 39:12.515
...moments where we lose faith.

39:12.975 --> 39:14.267
But it's our flaws...

39:15.019 --> 39:17.604
...our weaknesses
that make us human.

39:32.620 --> 39:35.955
They're here.

39:39.001 --> 39:41.002
They're here!

39:41.420 --> 39:44.130
They're everywhere!

39:44.298 --> 39:50.553
They're here!

39:50.805 --> 39:54.808
Science now performs miracles
like the gods of old.

39:54.975 --> 39:58.478
Creating life from blood cells or bacteria
or a spark of metal.

39:58.979 --> 40:00.647
But they're perfect creatures...

40:00.815 --> 40:03.817
...and in that way,
they couldn't be less human.

40:04.860 --> 40:07.320
There are things machines
will never do.

40:07.488 --> 40:11.408
They cannot possess faith,
they cannot commune with God.

40:11.575 --> 40:16.037
Every tree that bringeth
not forth good fruit is hewn down...

40:17.164 --> 40:19.999
...and cast into the fire.

40:32.471 --> 40:35.014
They cannot appreciate beauty.

40:35.349 --> 40:37.600
They cannot create art.

40:37.768 --> 40:40.353
[PIANO MUSIC PLAYING
ON STEREO]

40:40.521 --> 40:44.274
If they ever learn these things,
they won't have to destroy us.

40:46.569 --> 40:48.611
They'll be us.
