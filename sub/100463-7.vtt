WEBVTT

00:17.510 --> 00:19.751
Coch/Yoco was one of us.

00:21.020 --> 00:22.476
Deservea’ better.

00:23.940 --> 00:25.339
We all do.

00:28.360 --> 00:29.930
The time comes,

00:30.820 --> 00:32.435
you open your eyes,

00:33.360 --> 00:35.408
don't recognize home.

00:38.700 --> 00:41.908
You don't recognize this thing
'cause Flix changed it.

00:42.870 --> 00:44.826
I keep telling you, Gero,

00:45.420 --> 00:48.708
the old days are gone.

00:50.000 --> 00:52.207
So how do I explain this?

00:52.760 --> 00:54.625
What do I tell my guys?

00:54.720 --> 00:56.119
The truth.

00:56.590 --> 00:59.969
Flix did it for Benjamn, Tijuana.

01:00.760 --> 01:03.888
If the Federation were to lose them now...

01:05.730 --> 01:07.595
it goes down fast.

01:08.310 --> 01:12.394
Only ourselves to blame.
We jo/neo’ into this shit.

01:13.110 --> 01:15.021
We allowed F/I'X to rule us.

01:17.280 --> 01:21.569
Yeah, well... didn't have
a lot of choices.

01:23.040 --> 01:25.406
Maybe didn't look for a better one.

01:26.000 --> 01:27.285
Right.

01:28.040 --> 01:29.576
So maybe it’s time.

01:32.210 --> 01:34.667
Time to find a better option.

01:37.800 --> 01:41.804
Let Flix suck Benjamn's cock.

01:41.890 --> 01:45.803
You and me,
we gotta worry about ourselves.

01:47.390 --> 01:50.188
We start to do what F/iX isn ’t.

01:52.690 --> 01:54.021
Protect each other.

01:56.690 --> 01:58.191
Break from the Federation?

02:00.780 --> 02:02.441
Could work.

02:03.740 --> 02:05.742
It would work, man.

02:09.040 --> 02:10.325
No.

02:10.830 --> 02:14.664
Lot of bullshit, starting over.

02:14.750 --> 02:17.753
I'm looking to go the other way.

02:18.260 --> 02:20.581
St/l/ think you ’re getting out; huh?

02:20.680 --> 02:24.423
You've been saying that shit
since I was working for you.

02:24.510 --> 02:25.556
Oh, yeah?

02:25.640 --> 02:30.805
Guess every day brings a new chance
to be a little less full of shit.

02:31.980 --> 02:33.015
Yeah.

02:33.110 --> 02:37.103
Look, this new deal with the Colombians,

02:37.570 --> 02:39.856
it's more than Flix can handle.

02:41.320 --> 02:42.651
The man is desperate.

02:43.780 --> 02:45.577
And desperate men...

02:46.120 --> 02:48.361
Not long for this Earth.

02:49.620 --> 02:50.917
You recognize the voice?

02:52.210 --> 02:53.450
Fucking Acosta.

02:53.540 --> 02:54.620
Trust me.

02:55.340 --> 02:58.161
Keep your head down,
your foobar/ht //ght. . .

02:58.260 --> 03:02.799
And wait for FliX’s time to run out.

03:03.300 --> 03:05.757
-Make me a copy of this.
-Yes, sir.

05:01.050 --> 05:02.870
Babe, the helicopter is on the roof
waiting for me.

05:05.010 --> 05:08.218
Got to go to Mexico City
for important business.

05:08.680 --> 05:10.557
Lots of money on the line.

05:13.770 --> 05:16.307
-Sorry.
-Come on, you're not even trying.

05:16.390 --> 05:18.802
I told you, this stuff turns me on.

05:21.230 --> 05:23.687
I love what a big deal you are.

05:23.780 --> 05:26.021
Bring that big deal over here.

05:29.120 --> 05:31.190
No, love, I gotta go.

05:33.950 --> 05:35.998
You were supposed to come last night.

05:37.710 --> 05:41.168
I told you, Hctor came home early.

05:41.250 --> 05:42.877
I couldn't get away.

05:44.090 --> 05:45.626
Come on,

05:45.720 --> 05:47.790
at least you had me all morning.

05:51.470 --> 05:53.461
Fucking Palma, who does he think he is?

05:54.560 --> 05:55.675
The big boss?

05:56.480 --> 05:58.721
Flix is the one telling him what to do.

05:58.810 --> 06:02.018
Not everyone can be as tough as you, baby.

06:03.230 --> 06:04.640
So stay.

06:05.190 --> 06:06.930
You have me all day.

06:10.280 --> 06:13.784
No way. Flix finishes breakfast
and I'm not there, he'll kill me.

06:14.240 --> 06:16.993
And he tells my husband what to do.

06:20.500 --> 06:22.127
Don't mess with me.

06:22.840 --> 06:23.955
Call you later.

06:29.430 --> 06:33.639
CRDENAS POPULARITY DECLINES

06:37.140 --> 06:38.767
The fuck are you doing here?

06:43.690 --> 06:45.817
I thought I made myself clear.

06:47.070 --> 06:48.435
Just having coffee.

06:50.070 --> 06:51.480
Is that so bad?

06:52.950 --> 06:54.440
You think this is a game?

06:55.540 --> 06:57.280
This is my life. I told you to stay away.

06:57.830 --> 06:59.115
Yeah.

07:00.040 --> 07:03.123
From the house, from school.

07:04.290 --> 07:05.791
This is a caf.

07:08.880 --> 07:10.586
Not sure it qualifies as "yours."

07:12.180 --> 07:14.717
Seem to remember it was me
that first brought you here.

07:16.220 --> 07:17.551
Enjoy your coffee.

07:18.850 --> 07:21.762
-Give my best to your old man.
-He's not interested in you either.

07:26.320 --> 07:27.856
He told me about Cochiloco.

07:30.450 --> 07:31.599
What you did.

07:36.580 --> 07:39.196
Didn't remember your father
liking gossip so much.

07:41.330 --> 07:44.322
We adapt or everything goes to shit.

07:45.670 --> 07:47.456
He made his choice.

07:48.960 --> 07:52.873
You know, it takes someone special
to abandon everyone

07:53.470 --> 07:56.257
and still find a reason to blame them.

07:58.140 --> 08:00.131
You chose the wrong side, Miguel ngel.

08:02.100 --> 08:04.398
You fucked over anyone
who cared about you.

08:06.020 --> 08:07.931
Now bad things are happening to you.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.521
Because you're a bad guy.

08:14.280 --> 08:16.111
A new day is coming.

08:17.530 --> 08:22.240
Some will be punished
and some will be rewarded.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.239
What...

08:26.170 --> 08:27.831
you find God or something?

08:31.300 --> 08:32.710
Maybe something better.

08:36.140 --> 08:37.755
Good luck with that.

09:43.450 --> 09:45.827
Making a habit of these visits.

09:46.460 --> 09:49.623
Though, I must say I'm not surprised,
given the news.

09:50.040 --> 09:53.419
What happened with the nomination?
You were so sure.

09:54.170 --> 09:58.584
Gave my life to this party and they choose
that fucking technocrat.

10:01.470 --> 10:04.462
So the big-eared dwarf and his brother
didn't want your money?

10:05.430 --> 10:07.933
Look, Cuauhtmoc Crdenas,

10:08.020 --> 10:10.978
he was a governor in Michoacn.

10:11.060 --> 10:14.223
A member of the PRI. _
He was your colleague. Don't you know hIm?

10:14.320 --> 10:16.060
Yeah, and I know his father too.

10:17.280 --> 10:18.850
They're a fucking institution.

10:18.950 --> 10:21.657
Old man would win the presidency again,
if he were still around.

10:21.740 --> 10:26.279
And privatization undoes
everything he created.

10:26.750 --> 10:29.287
The farmland, the oil, all of it.

10:29.920 --> 10:32.741
Did your homework. Congratulations.

10:33.170 --> 10:36.128
The party plans to destroy
his father's legacy.

10:37.170 --> 10:38.797
He needs us.

10:39.590 --> 10:40.887
Make the introduction.

10:43.850 --> 10:47.638
I have to admit the Italian suits
start to fool you.

10:48.390 --> 10:52.099
Do you know why Cuauhtmoc left the party?

10:53.440 --> 10:54.600
Because of us.

10:55.900 --> 11:00.906
Says the party is in league
with traffickers and corrupt politicians.

11:03.160 --> 11:04.866
He's got to need something.

11:08.410 --> 11:12.779
Crdenas takes office,

11:12.880 --> 11:14.916
and you're in a jail cell the same day.

11:17.420 --> 11:20.753
You think Crdenas can actually win?

11:24.930 --> 11:26.170
I don't think.

11:28.140 --> 11:29.516
I know so.

12:57.610 --> 13:01.728
Crdenas has support in the major cities,
educated centers.

13:02.320 --> 13:07.860
The PRI's influence is holding
to the more rural, less populated areas,

13:07.950 --> 13:11.238
where ignorance and illiteracy
reign supreme.

13:11.330 --> 13:13.992
Yeah, but these
are just projections, right?

13:15.750 --> 13:18.878
A preview of what's to come.

13:18.960 --> 13:21.997
Okay, but none of this is exact.

13:22.960 --> 13:28.080
These projections aren't gonna change,
because a margin of error is built in.

13:28.180 --> 13:30.466
Which brings us to the real problem.

13:31.100 --> 13:32.761
Mexico City.

13:32.850 --> 13:37.298
Crdenas is projecting a win
at 54 percent.

13:38.600 --> 13:40.181
A coin toss.

13:40.270 --> 13:41.510
No.

13:42.020 --> 13:43.772
A fucking tragedy.

13:46.110 --> 13:49.022
What about the rest of the country?
Stop there.

13:49.110 --> 13:51.271
Len, Guanajuato... doing well there.

13:51.370 --> 13:53.611
Yes, but it won't matter.

13:53.700 --> 13:58.569
The first precincts to report
are all in the city.

13:58.670 --> 14:01.332
They're the only ones
the media reports on.

14:03.250 --> 14:07.755
Every six years,
on election day at 7:00 p.m.,

14:08.220 --> 14:11.792
they report a landslide PRI victory.

14:20.690 --> 14:24.774
or worse, they can't...

14:24.860 --> 14:26.430
It's gonna be fucked.

14:27.650 --> 14:30.357
Crdenas has given people
a reason to believe.

14:31.120 --> 14:35.819
They see these numbers on election day?
They'll know change is coming.

14:35.910 --> 14:40.279
And nothing will pull his supporters
out of the voting line.

14:41.500 --> 14:43.456
The PRI is gonna be crushed.

14:45.050 --> 14:47.371
It’s time we meet again.

14:48.340 --> 14:51.582
Can't imagine why.
We left very little unsaid.

14:51.680 --> 14:53.545
Drop the act.

14:54.100 --> 14:55.749
It’s time for you to open your eyes.

14:55.850 --> 14:58.011
I'm wide awake, my friend.

14:59.230 --> 15:01.266
Quite content with the view.

15:01.350 --> 15:03.147
I don ’t know what you ’re seeing.

15:03.230 --> 15:05.767
Crdenas has your brother beat.

15:05.860 --> 15:07.316
Ah, so you’ve heard.

15:07.400 --> 15:09.448
An exciting time.

15:09.530 --> 15:14.320
Even the less fortunate
deserve a good thrill.

15:14.410 --> 15:16.731
My brother wﬂl be their president too.

15:16.830 --> 15:19.071
You don't understand.
Or maybe you don't want to.

15:19.160 --> 15:21.958
My fam/ly has experience
with these things, F/iX.

15:22.040 --> 15:25.532
Stories like Crdenas', they come and go.
Fables, for children.

15:26.710 --> 15:29.713
You hear the one about the Pope?
When he visited Mexico,

15:30.300 --> 15:31.961
he went boating with Crdenas.

15:32.050 --> 15:33.631
They say the Pope ’s hat blew oh:

15:33.720 --> 15:35.927
and Crdenas walked across the water
to get it back.

15:36.760 --> 15:39.388
But you and me know the truth,
Crdenas can't swim.

15:40.060 --> 15:43.143
The PRI's gonna hold his head down
while he drowns.

15:43.900 --> 15:45.356
Was there anything else?

15:48.150 --> 15:50.562
All right, let's see...

15:51.740 --> 15:53.526
Let's see what you think of this.

15:54.320 --> 15:57.824
Zapopan, Crdenas is up by 16 percent,

15:57.910 --> 16:02.074
Puebla 12 percent, Zipolite 22 percent,
want me to go on?

16:03.870 --> 16:08.455
Ask yourself how I got these numbers.
Who else I can give them to?

16:09.880 --> 16:11.757
Mexico’s on the eve of change.

16:13.380 --> 16:16.042
How bad/y does your brother
want to stop it?

16:20.270 --> 16:22.682
Hotel Ciudad de Mexico, 4:00.

16:26.020 --> 16:26.930
Good.

16:28.190 --> 16:29.396
See you there.

17:22.080 --> 17:23.900
What the fuck did you just do?

17:24.460 --> 17:27.952
You had no right to tell that criminal.

17:29.040 --> 17:32.874
Tell me something. What the fuck
were you planning on doing with this?

17:32.960 --> 17:35.542
Nothing.
The party thinks they don't need me?

17:35.630 --> 17:38.212
Then they don't get to see this.

17:40.930 --> 17:43.091
How's Crdenas' relationship with America?

17:43.180 --> 17:45.592
'Cause the gringos know all about you.

17:45.680 --> 17:48.183
Your dipshit nephew's made sure of it.

17:50.190 --> 17:55.935
If the party loses, you're with me
on the next plane to the States.

17:56.570 --> 17:58.481
So get your head out of your ass.

17:59.410 --> 18:01.116
What's Crdenas know about all this?

18:01.200 --> 18:02.986
I told you, no one knows anything.

18:03.830 --> 18:05.115
He doesn't know?

18:06.910 --> 18:08.616
He doesn't know he's gonna win?

18:10.290 --> 18:12.793
Good. Tell him.

18:13.670 --> 18:14.625
You're joking.

18:15.710 --> 18:18.759
I'm gonna use it as leverage. So tell him.

18:20.010 --> 18:22.251
I hope you know what you're doing.

21:49.680 --> 21:51.750
We seem to have a problem, boss.

21:52.310 --> 21:54.050
Azul is awaiting your call.

22:29.470 --> 22:30.755
Put this on.

22:48.990 --> 22:51.618
The issue with Acosta, it’s not good.

22:52.070 --> 22:54.072
I know, damn it.I What else?

22:55.080 --> 22:56.866
Aguilar played me the tapes.

22:56.950 --> 22:59.032
How bad is it?

23:00.460 --> 23:02.917
Acosta talks a lot of shit.

23:03.000 --> 23:05.742
Says you're on the way out, going down.

23:06.710 --> 23:10.259
But Flix, Acosta's not the problem.

23:11.340 --> 23:14.889
Hctor Palma made the call, reached out.

23:15.600 --> 23:18.012
7'o/d Acosta they don ’t need you.

23:18.100 --> 23:21.843
Suggested they join together,
Sina/oa and Jurez.

23:22.480 --> 23:24.220
That fucker is nothing without me.

23:25.570 --> 23:27.640
Why is he coming up with this now?

23:27.730 --> 23:28.776
Why doesn ’t matter.

23:29.360 --> 23:30.987
The idea's out there.

23:31.740 --> 23:34.368
Now would be a bad _time
to appear weak, Sir.

23:35.120 --> 23:37.532
How the fuck did this happen?

23:40.960 --> 23:42.700
What do you want to do, boss?

23:44.670 --> 23:46.160
Kill him.

23:47.210 --> 23:50.839
Palma was gifted Sinaloa and he's been
a fucking problem ever since.

23:52.470 --> 23:53.926
What about Acosta?

24:57.370 --> 24:59.110
You just gonna stand there?

25:00.870 --> 25:04.704
Grab that tool box, bring it up here.

25:45.580 --> 25:47.787
Welcome, sir.

26:25.250 --> 26:26.569
Welcome, sir.

26:55.530 --> 26:58.602
What's going on? Where is he?

26:59.490 --> 27:01.981
Not one for pleasantries, I see.

27:02.070 --> 27:04.402
I understand there's something
you need to tell me.

27:06.410 --> 27:08.708
You have five minutes, Flix.

27:10.460 --> 27:12.246
Would you like to take a seat?

27:58.050 --> 27:59.415
You drink?

31:21.830 --> 31:26.199
Because the truth matters to me.

35:22.820 --> 35:25.197
All of this data has been confirmed.

35:27.790 --> 35:29.826
On July 6th, you're all going down.

35:31.420 --> 35:33.570
What will that leave you?

35:36.550 --> 35:40.088
Well, I think we can survive this.
Together.

35:43.930 --> 35:48.048
These projections, they're interesting...

35:49.350 --> 35:51.978
but guarantee nothing.

35:54.310 --> 35:55.811
How is Andrs, anyway?

35:57.900 --> 36:02.849
Still bitter about the nomination,
it seems.

36:07.030 --> 36:10.534
What, you didn't expect me to believe
your associates put these together?

36:11.080 --> 36:12.069
No.

36:13.420 --> 36:16.412
It leads me to one conclusion...

36:17.090 --> 36:19.411
only the party knows these exist.

36:21.220 --> 36:25.179
And they have some experience
in the suppression of information.

36:29.220 --> 36:30.266
No.

36:30.850 --> 36:32.431
Crdenas knows too.

36:34.060 --> 36:36.267
I made sure of that.

36:37.520 --> 36:39.681
When these projections get out,

36:39.780 --> 36:42.101
it's going to create a ground swell
in this country.

36:42.650 --> 36:45.062
And nothing the party can do
will stop it.

36:48.870 --> 36:49.985
I see.

36:52.910 --> 36:55.629
So I take it you have a cure?

36:56.130 --> 36:59.042
For this disease, sure to kill us.

37:04.380 --> 37:06.962
I'm listening.

37:08.800 --> 37:10.768
Tell the people a different story.

37:11.970 --> 37:15.895
Those projections came from
a new computer program,

37:15.980 --> 37:19.268
capable of reporting election day returns,
in real time.

37:19.980 --> 37:25.100
And the early results will show
the whole country Crdenas is winning.

37:36.250 --> 37:41.620
And in time, when an official hand-count
is tallied and Crdenas has won?

37:42.260 --> 37:44.797
What good will your bullshit "program"
have done us?

37:44.880 --> 37:46.507
Will he have won?

37:48.800 --> 37:53.260
You tell the masses Crdenas is losing,
they won't leave the fucking house.

37:54.100 --> 37:56.227
You'll have taken their hope away.

37:57.690 --> 37:59.601
People only want to back a winner.

38:00.440 --> 38:02.772
Who's going to vote for a loser?

38:05.360 --> 38:06.987
-Wel|, sure.
-So the party loses Mexico City,

38:07.070 --> 38:09.231
but it makes up the difference
everywhere else.

38:11.160 --> 38:14.197
And people have to wait six years
before they can get back in line.

38:16.080 --> 38:18.867
Because you'll have
won the election legitimately.

38:18.960 --> 38:20.916
Without tampering with a single ballot.

38:30.430 --> 38:31.590
And in return?

38:33.220 --> 38:35.927
I get a direct relationship
with the new administration.

38:37.600 --> 38:39.556
My interests are protected.

38:40.060 --> 38:41.186
Always.

38:44.070 --> 38:46.561
I must say, I'm impressed.

38:47.490 --> 38:52.985
I'd heard stories about you, but this...

38:55.160 --> 39:00.666
Quite a rise
for a piece of trash like yourself.

39:02.630 --> 39:04.166
You should know something.

39:05.090 --> 39:07.376
These men I speak for, Flix?

39:08.720 --> 39:12.008
They make wonderful friends,
but intolerable enemies.

39:12.890 --> 39:17.668
I find out you're lying,
what you've told me today isn't true?

39:19.520 --> 39:21.056
The fall is swift.

39:22.610 --> 39:25.067
You don't survive it.

39:38.250 --> 39:39.649
You'll hear from me.

43:10.080 --> 43:11.991
-You hungry?
-Yeah!

43:14.300 --> 43:16.370
-Where's your mom?
-Don't know.

43:17.970 --> 43:19.926
-You don't know?
-No.

43:22.090 --> 43:23.466
Lupita, come on.

43:23.890 --> 43:25.175
Dinner's ready.

43:28.060 --> 43:29.266
Lupita!

43:42.820 --> 43:44.617
Lupita, you up here?

43:48.040 --> 43:49.996
Baby, what's wrong?

43:50.710 --> 43:52.166
What's going on?

43:56.840 --> 43:58.250
I'm so sorry, Hctor.

43:59.550 --> 44:00.756
Tell me.

44:23.160 --> 44:25.697
Palma, you in here?

44:30.000 --> 44:31.319
Flix called.

44:32.250 --> 44:34.115
Needs us at the office.

45:47.200 --> 45:48.269
Guys!

46:44.510 --> 46:45.909
Fuck your mother, you asshole!

46:48.510 --> 46:50.046
Yours too, motherfucker!

46:55.180 --> 46:56.727
Come out, you fuck!

47:05.570 --> 47:06.980
Fucking thing's beautiful.

47:10.410 --> 47:11.900
What's with you?

47:13.990 --> 47:15.070
What's up?

47:16.370 --> 47:17.997
Talked to Aguilar?

47:18.540 --> 47:20.110
No, what happened?

47:20.830 --> 47:22.912
Some shit's going down.

47:23.460 --> 47:24.745
What shit?

47:26.670 --> 47:30.049
-Talk to Aguilar, man.
-Fuck that, what happened?

49:37.640 --> 49:40.632
Come on, Moreo,
please tell me you have something.

49:41.720 --> 49:42.846
I don't.

49:43.430 --> 49:46.433
Son of a... Do you know what happens
if we don't figure this out?

49:46.980 --> 49:48.857
This shit is complicated.

49:49.690 --> 49:52.227
You know how much data
I need to manipulate

49:52.320 --> 49:54.606
to make your dummy program
look legitimate?

49:54.700 --> 49:57.316
Why did you tell them we have it,
if it isn't true?

49:57.410 --> 50:00.618
Because I'm dead if we don't,
you moron. Fix it.

50:07.830 --> 50:09.070
Pablo.

50:23.100 --> 50:24.556
The hell have you been?

50:26.520 --> 50:29.148
Belize. Chiapas.

50:30.270 --> 50:33.273
That thing with the planes, remember?
I told you.

50:38.820 --> 50:40.651
Shit's pretty cool, man.

50:41.450 --> 50:42.439
In Chiapas.

50:42.990 --> 50:47.279
Some country shit, just how you like it.
We should go.

50:47.370 --> 50:48.359
So go, then.

50:48.460 --> 50:51.532
I mean it. Both of us. Let's go.

50:51.630 --> 50:54.667
You think I'm getting on
one of your little planes,

50:55.590 --> 50:57.046
you're out of your fucking mind.

50:59.630 --> 51:01.598
Think I don't know why you're here?

51:03.640 --> 51:06.052
Flix tried to kill Palma.

51:08.020 --> 51:11.933
That what has you so spooked?
You figure I'm next?

51:13.650 --> 51:16.392
I can fix this shit, Pablo.

51:17.740 --> 51:20.402
I'll talk to Flix.

51:20.490 --> 51:21.866
He needs me right now.

51:22.450 --> 51:23.986
Fuck Flix.

51:27.450 --> 51:31.159
Just listen to me for once
In your fucking life.

51:32.580 --> 51:33.410
No.

51:34.540 --> 51:36.588
I already know what I'm gonna do.

51:50.230 --> 51:54.348
Finally got yourself killed. That's what
you've always wanted, isn't it?

51:57.110 --> 52:02.275
Go out with your pride,
like a real fucking bandit.

52:05.780 --> 52:07.407
But it doesn't have to be that way.

52:07.490 --> 52:10.903
You could keep your pride and your life
if you'd just listen to me.

52:13.540 --> 52:16.998
Close the door when you leave.
Don't want a draft coming in.

52:19.880 --> 52:20.960
Pablo--

52:29.220 --> 52:30.426
Okay.

52:32.890 --> 52:34.300
Hey, Dopey.

52:38.070 --> 52:40.106
Fake as shit, but...

52:41.240 --> 52:42.355
I've always liked it.

52:48.410 --> 52:51.117
Even tells the date and everything.

52:59.130 --> 53:00.449
At some point...

53:02.840 --> 53:06.549
you're gonna need to
stab this motherfucker in the back.

53:08.810 --> 53:12.223
I just hope you'll know
when that time has come.

53:20.320 --> 53:21.435
Door!

54:15.790 --> 54:17.326
We have a problem.

54:19.290 --> 54:23.829
One of the agents from Leyenda,
he's way out in Ojinaga.

54:25.170 --> 54:27.047
I'll give you one guess as to why.

54:29.180 --> 54:30.716
Stay on it.

54:32.140 --> 54:34.131
And no more mistakes.
