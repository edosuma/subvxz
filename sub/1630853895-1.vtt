<i>There's a big gap.</i>

00:49.440 --> 00:51.320
<i>It seems like the only route,
let's keep going.</i>

00:57.280 --> 00:58.200
You okay?

01:01.080 --> 01:03.560
It's about right.
Can't ever be easy.

01:04.640 --> 01:05.560
Okay.

01:07.280 --> 01:08.320
-One.
-Be careful.

01:08.440 --> 01:09.800
Two, three.

01:11.800 --> 01:13.440
You okay? Okay.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.000
Oh, my God.

01:17.440 --> 01:18.400
You're better.

01:21.480 --> 01:22.400
Okay.

01:28.040 --> 01:29.160
-Shit!
-Whoa, you're good.

01:29.560 --> 01:32.000
You're good, yeah? You're good?

01:33.360 --> 01:36.040
-No.
-Okay, you've done way scarier than this.

01:36.600 --> 01:38.480
Remember AJ Hackett, Snake Dike.

01:38.960 --> 01:40.560
Stupid singing competition.

01:40.680 --> 01:43.120
God, you married this sad sack,
for Christ's sake.

01:44.200 --> 01:45.560
-Yeah? Okay.
-Okay.

01:46.680 --> 01:50.320
One, two, three.

01:50.840 --> 01:52.320
Come on, I caught you

01:53.600 --> 01:54.600
That's my girl.

01:57.000 --> 02:00.720
Ew, gross. You guys get a room.

02:02.640 --> 02:03.880
There's comes Ethan Hunt.

02:04.680 --> 02:06.560
Careful, H, there's loose rock
around the elbow.

02:06.920 --> 02:08.680
Worry about your ropes, bitches.

02:09.000 --> 02:10.038
I'm fine.

02:12.560 --> 02:13.520
Try to keep on.

02:23.960 --> 02:25.280
Taking your time there, hot-shot.

02:27.120 --> 02:28.560
Hunter, you show-off.

03:06.800 --> 03:07.640
Dan!

03:11.120 --> 03:12.040
Dan!

03:13.520 --> 03:14.760
Hang on Dan, hold on, I'm coming.

03:15.080 --> 03:16.000
Dan, are you okay?

03:16.160 --> 03:17.640
Just hold on, I'm coming down.

03:19.360 --> 03:21.840
Come on, come on. I can't make to it.

03:22.240 --> 03:23.760
-Oh, my God.
-Okay, Becky, Becky.

03:23.880 --> 03:26.680
I just need a little more line,
can you uncut? Are you secure?

03:27.600 --> 03:29.720
-Are you secure?
-Yeah, yeah, I'm secure.

03:29.840 --> 03:32.400
Just uncut, and I'll be able
to swing to the rock.

03:32.560 --> 03:33.960
-Okay.
-I think I can reach it.

03:34.440 --> 03:35.360
Ready?

03:40.000 --> 03:42.320
-Can you reach it?
-Just, just one second.

03:42.560 --> 03:43.960
I think I can make it.

03:44.160 --> 03:46.160
Hold on Dan, I'm almost there.

03:46.280 --> 03:47.520
I just need more momentum.

03:47.640 --> 03:48.560
Okay.

03:49.560 --> 03:50.480
No!

03:52.960 --> 03:53.920

<i>Look, I've tried to console you
every way I know how.</i>

04:27.160 --> 04:31.360
<i>But I... I can't help you
if you don't pick up the phone.</i>

04:32.000 --> 04:33.520
<i>Sweetheart, I'm worried about you.</i>

04:34.280 --> 04:38.520
<i>So whenever you stop
hating on me, I am here.</i>

04:38.640 --> 04:39.880
CREMATED REMAINS

DAN

05:07.960 --> 05:09.040
<i>Hey, what's up?</i>

05:10.080 --> 05:13.920
<i>This is just a voicemail,
you've reached Dan.</i>

05:14.040 --> 05:16.000
<i>Just leave a message
and I'll hit you back when I can.</i>

05:16.120 --> 05:17.640
<i>Get it on for the the beep.</i>

05:18.840 --> 05:19.800
Hey.

05:21.760 --> 05:22.680
I miss you.

05:30.960 --> 05:33.120
Dad, what? Are you stalking me now?

05:34.000 --> 05:36.904
No, I just don't know what else to do
because you're not answering your phone.

05:36.988 --> 05:37.857
Take a hint.

05:37.941 --> 05:39.756
I think this is getting
a little bit ridiculous.

05:39.840 --> 05:40.800
Ridiculous?

05:40.960 --> 05:45.196
You told me I shouldn't be so broken up
about him because he was an asshole.

05:45.280 --> 05:47.809
No, I said that maybe he didn't belong
on this pedestal

05:47.893 --> 05:49.076
that you were putting him up on.

05:49.160 --> 05:52.000
That he wasn't this martyr
that you've been making him out to be.

05:52.120 --> 05:53.560
This is how you console your daughter?

05:53.680 --> 05:55.680
I just want you
to be able to move on with your life.

05:55.800 --> 05:58.680
I don't wanna move on, I miss him.

06:00.160 --> 06:02.040
Every day, I miss the way he looked at me.

06:02.160 --> 06:03.640
I miss the way he made me feel.

06:03.760 --> 06:04.720
-Sweetie.
-Don't.

06:04.913 --> 06:06.953
Don't what?
What do you think you're doing, Becky?

06:07.080 --> 06:08.480
-I'm getting away from you.
-You are not driving. Stop it.

06:08.680 --> 06:10.080
Fuck off!

06:10.600 --> 06:12.040
You don't get to talk to me like that!

06:12.400 --> 06:14.560
Your mother and I,
we raised you better than that.

06:15.160 --> 06:19.120
So, getting shit-faced
and pushing the people away that love you

06:20.200 --> 06:21.360
is not gonna work.

06:21.760 --> 06:23.840
All right, look, a horrible thing
happened to you.

06:24.800 --> 06:26.960
But you have to start
living your life again.

06:27.720 --> 06:30.106
All right? There's a whole big
wide world out there that needs you.

06:30.190 --> 06:32.223
And believe it or not, I need you.

06:33.240 --> 06:34.720
Let me give you a ride home.

06:36.800 --> 06:38.040
I'd rather walk.

06:41.400 --> 06:42.520
Let me ask you something.

06:44.200 --> 06:45.320
If roles reversed,

06:45.440 --> 06:47.400
if it had been you
that had fallen that day,

06:48.120 --> 06:50.200
You think Dan is standing out here alone

06:50.400 --> 06:54.320
drowning in booze, grief, sorrow,
whatever the hell this is.

06:56.120 --> 06:57.400
He's not.

06:58.120 --> 06:59.440
And you damn well know it.

07:01.040 --> 07:02.840
Goddamn it, Becky, I need you to try.

07:05.680 --> 07:06.800
Do you know what I need, Dad?

07:07.800 --> 07:09.520
I need you to leave me alone.

07:18.200 --> 07:19.120
Goddamn it.

-Awful.
-Yeah, like really freaking awful.

08:22.720 --> 08:23.640
Come here.

08:26.560 --> 08:31.240
So, what brings you back?
You're finally ready to rest?

08:32.558 --> 08:33.840
I'll rest when I'm dead.

08:35.200 --> 08:38.640
I have something that's planned,
and I need a partner in crime.

08:40.679 --> 08:43.440
Look, your Dad called me a few weeks ago.

08:44.440 --> 08:47.600
He didn't know who else to turn to.
And he said that you were in a bad place.

08:47.760 --> 08:49.880
-He had no right to do that.
-He's worried about you.

08:50.360 --> 08:52.720
It's coming up on a year,
he doesn't want you to be alone.

08:53.600 --> 08:56.931
Look, the only thing that drives me
crazier than Dan's boxed ashes

08:57.015 --> 08:58.342
collecting dust in there

08:58.440 --> 09:00.080
is my best friend stuck in here with him.

09:01.360 --> 09:03.440
So, I have something
that I wanna pitch you.

09:03.680 --> 09:06.400
You're not gonna like it,
but just try to keep an open mind.

09:06.840 --> 09:07.840
Look.

09:09.960 --> 09:12.040
The B67 TV tower.

09:13.160 --> 09:14.720
It's only a six hour drive from here.

09:14.840 --> 09:16.760
I was planning
on climbing it this weekend

09:16.880 --> 09:18.720
and I wanted to see
if you'd climb it with me.

09:22.200 --> 09:25.920
I would be an adventure, like old times.

09:26.800 --> 09:28.720
And you could scatter Dan's ashes on top.

09:30.480 --> 09:32.360
I just... I haven't climbed since--

09:32.480 --> 09:33.400
I get it.

09:35.160 --> 09:38.240
But if you don't confront your fears
you are always going to be afraid.

09:39.000 --> 09:43.480
What is it that Dan used to say?
Don't die if you wanna to live?

09:43.600 --> 09:46.440
Or, keep living even if you're dying?

09:47.320 --> 09:48.720
Shit, I feel like
I'm messing this pitch up.

09:48.840 --> 09:51.880
No, I'm sorry, Hunter, I just... I can't.

09:53.800 --> 09:55.880
It's like a "no,"
I can't do it. I'm sorry.

09:56.640 --> 09:57.800
You're gonna be okay.

09:57.960 --> 09:59.680
-I can't.
-Hey, it's okay.

10:00.920 --> 10:01.840
It's okay.

10:38.800 --> 10:39.920
Morning, Princess.

10:42.480 --> 10:43.560
What's wrong?

10:44.800 --> 10:46.840
If you're scared of dying
don't be afraid to live.

10:48.800 --> 10:50.080
That's what Dan used to say.

10:52.480 --> 10:56.120
Let's do it.
Let's climb your stupid tower.

10:56.360 --> 10:59.640
Oh my gosh, Becky baby, I'm so excited.

11:10.360 --> 11:11.760
Shit, I was really ripped.

11:11.880 --> 11:13.640
Yeah, you're awesome.

11:14.160 --> 11:16.080
That is the Becky
that we need for this trip.

11:18.600 --> 11:22.960
Holy shit, look at your beaming face.

11:23.200 --> 11:24.440
Who is this in the photo with you?

11:24.560 --> 11:26.080
I don't know, it's an old date.

11:26.846 --> 11:28.486
-Who is it?
-Nobody, just give me my--

11:28.640 --> 11:30.320
Hunter has a boyfriend.

11:30.440 --> 11:32.520
It's nothing, just some guy.

11:32.640 --> 11:35.160
Oh, that "some guy" sure knew
how to tickle your whistle.

11:39.080 --> 11:40.840

11:51.160 --> 11:52.760
<i>--super bad-ass.</i>

11:53.273 --> 11:55.593
Okay, in my defense,

11:55.800 --> 11:58.680
I may act like a total dick on camera,
but it's worth it.

11:59.000 --> 12:00.080
I get paid for this shit.

12:00.280 --> 12:02.280
It's enough to keep me traveling,
and you know me,

12:02.400 --> 12:05.160
I have to be doing dangerous shit
to keep my blood pumping.

12:05.428 --> 12:07.068
So, I might as well wanna try this gig.

12:07.240 --> 12:09.640
I'm just saying,
if you're gonna be a YouTuber,

12:09.760 --> 12:11.640
Why not be yourself? You are awesome.

12:11.840 --> 12:13.520
-Natural born click bait.
-No.

12:14.240 --> 12:16.720
What we're doing here, this is click bait.

12:20.440 --> 12:21.400
Excuse me?

12:22.480 --> 12:23.960
Do you have somewhere
I could charge my phone.

12:24.320 --> 12:25.440
Power ain't free, ma'am.

12:26.280 --> 12:28.960
And do you know where the B67 TV tower is?

12:29.080 --> 12:30.320
We can't find it on the map.

12:31.200 --> 12:32.240
You don't need a map.

12:33.600 --> 12:34.920
You see that light way up there?

12:36.840 --> 12:37.840
This's your tower.

12:38.440 --> 12:40.160
That's insanely high.

12:42.993 --> 12:44.913
What's with the light, I thought you said
it was out of commission?

12:45.040 --> 12:46.360
So aircraft can see it.

12:47.640 --> 12:50.120
You know this was once
the tallest structure in the US?

12:51.480 --> 12:53.000
And now it's just this old relic.

12:54.400 --> 12:56.280
They're gonna tear it down this winter.

12:57.520 --> 12:58.440
Becky?

12:58.760 --> 12:59.680
Becky.

13:00.560 --> 13:02.280
-What?
-Give me your phone charger.

13:03.480 --> 13:04.400
What are you doing?

13:06.960 --> 13:08.000
A very cool life hack.

13:10.640 --> 13:13.920
Now I'm just gonna line up the prongs
with the elements in the lamp.

13:14.280 --> 13:15.200
And...

13:18.000 --> 13:19.440
How's that for a dumb YouTuber?

13:37.920 --> 13:39.520
Hey, honey.

13:41.880 --> 13:42.880
Did you sleep well?

13:49.000 --> 13:50.080
I love you.

13:55.320 --> 13:56.640
You're not gonna say it back?

13:58.480 --> 13:59.480
I am saying it.

14:00.280 --> 14:05.600
One, four, three.

14:06.920 --> 14:08.080

14:37.880 --> 14:39.160

14:39.360 --> 14:41.920
I don't know, but something's up,
Sports Illustrated.

14:42.760 --> 14:43.720
Tits for clicks.

14:48.400 --> 14:49.440
Are you livestreaming?

14:49.760 --> 14:51.600
No girl, We'll shoot now, post later.

14:51.720 --> 14:52.920
Okay, I don't wanna be in it.

16:23.080 --> 16:24.800
-How far?
-I don't know.

16:27.160 --> 16:30.400

16:34.760 --> 16:36.620
Damn, it's hot.

16:36.720 --> 16:39.000
You'll cool down
once we get some air time.

16:40.080 --> 16:41.160
We got enough water you think?

16:41.360 --> 16:43.720
Water check, harnesses check.

16:43.840 --> 16:45.840
Super bad-ass 4K drone check.

16:45.960 --> 16:48.240
Selfie stick, only essentials.

16:49.040 --> 16:49.960
Food?

16:50.080 --> 16:51.640
No, I'll be back in time before lunch.

16:51.760 --> 16:52.760
Oh, Jesus.

16:56.360 --> 16:57.920
Holy shit, they're big.

17:02.640 --> 17:03.840
It's still alive.

17:04.400 --> 17:05.400
Get off of him!

17:05.640 --> 17:07.520
Hey! Shoo! Shoo.

17:07.640 --> 17:09.160
-Just go.
-Go.

17:16.200 --> 17:17.160
Poor thing.

17:21.440 --> 17:22.358
Pricks.

17:24.400 --> 17:25.960
Survival of the fittest, right?

17:27.760 --> 17:29.400
You'd do the same
if you were starving out here.

17:31.440 --> 17:33.000
Feeling peckish.

17:33.160 --> 17:34.600
-Hunter.
-What?

17:35.040 --> 17:36.080
That's funny.

17:49.520 --> 17:51.440
Holy shit, 300 likes.

17:51.640 --> 17:52.560
Oh, wow.

17:53.600 --> 17:55.000
350.

17:55.440 --> 17:57.840
I wonder how many
of your followers are serial killers?

18:01.240 --> 18:02.400
Holy shit.

18:03.880 --> 18:05.520
Looks a lot bigger up close, right?

18:08.000 --> 18:09.520
It is sick.

18:11.360 --> 18:12.600
This is awful.

18:13.920 --> 18:16.680
Hey, guys, Danger D here,

18:16.764 --> 18:20.883
and we are at the foot
of the stomach turningly massive

18:21.003 --> 18:23.396
fourth highest structure in the US.

18:23.480 --> 18:25.696
<i>We're gonna begin our grueling journey</i>

18:25.780 --> 18:29.992
within 1,800 foot ladder climb
inside a steel cage.

18:30.593 --> 18:36.076
And then, after the cage we have
a 200-foot vertigo-inspiring mast

18:36.160 --> 18:37.440
to the external ladder.

18:37.880 --> 18:40.120
Your girls gonna be wide open
to the elements.

18:40.440 --> 18:44.560
And then, beyond that,
we have the precipice, the ledge,

18:44.680 --> 18:46.800
<i>the top of the world.</i>

18:46.920 --> 18:47.960
Hunter.

18:52.120 --> 18:53.240
I'm sorry, I can't do it.

18:53.840 --> 18:55.040
Babe, of course you can.

18:55.160 --> 18:56.800
No, I really can't, I'm like...

18:58.120 --> 18:59.680
I'm petrified, and I'm shaking.

19:00.800 --> 19:01.800
I'm here.

19:03.160 --> 19:04.120
Take a breath.

19:06.800 --> 19:09.160
After Dan died,
I was afraid of my own. shadow.

19:10.200 --> 19:11.560
But I pushed through.

19:12.400 --> 19:14.800
I overcame the fear, I took control.

19:16.200 --> 19:17.720
Do not let this fear consume you.

19:18.840 --> 19:21.040
Come at it head on and kick its ass.

19:21.840 --> 19:24.000
If you can beat it, you can beat anything.

19:24.880 --> 19:27.880
And I am right here
beside you the whole time.

19:29.920 --> 19:31.920
You are so much stronger
than you think you are.

19:33.360 --> 19:35.880
So shut your shit, and let's do this.

19:38.720 --> 19:42.840
God, Hunter, you know that's the kind
of shit you should be posting on Instagram.

19:44.280 --> 19:45.200
Come on.

19:49.320 --> 19:51.200
Damn it, this is so cool.

19:51.680 --> 19:56.520
Holy shit. Look at this.

19:56.873 --> 19:57.873
Damn it, Hunter,

19:58.000 --> 19:59.760
you are such an asshole.

20:01.000 --> 20:02.080
What are you getting us into?

20:02.200 --> 20:03.160
Don't worry.

20:03.560 --> 20:05.440
We've got 50 feet of rope between us

20:05.560 --> 20:07.200
We are clipped in and we're all good.

20:08.876 --> 20:09.956
Okay.

20:10.040 --> 20:12.240
One leg at a time
and let me know if you have to rest.

20:42.240 --> 20:44.400
Okay. Okay.

20:52.960 --> 20:55.360
See? It's easy.

20:59.400 --> 21:00.560
Sure.

21:02.200 --> 21:03.800
You're doing a great, come on!

21:46.920 --> 21:47.960
You okay?

21:49.760 --> 21:50.760
No.

21:52.120 --> 21:54.520
You're doing a great, come on.

22:31.200 --> 22:32.160
Hunter?

22:34.600 --> 22:35.680
-Hunter?
-Yeah?

22:36.120 --> 22:38.720
Can we rest a moment? I need a drink.

22:39.320 --> 22:40.240
Of course.

22:42.760 --> 22:44.320
The skylines mean we're half way up.

22:48.240 --> 22:49.200
Perfect spot.

22:51.320 --> 22:52.600
Do you wanna do something crazy?

22:54.120 --> 22:55.040
What?

22:55.160 --> 22:58.800
Half way up, that means
we've climbed about a 1,000 feet.

22:59.520 --> 23:01.440
So, we've climbed the height
of the Eiffel Tower.

23:03.160 --> 23:04.600
Please don't say shit like that, Hunter.

23:07.480 --> 23:09.360
There's the motel, and the diner.

23:10.240 --> 23:13.040
Now way, looks like a little toy town.

23:18.080 --> 23:19.280
Let's just get this over with.

23:19.560 --> 23:20.480
Yeah.

23:24.240 --> 23:25.920
Come on, catch up.

23:45.080 --> 23:48.520
That's it, Becky, you're doing amazing.

23:51.960 --> 23:52.920
Come on.

23:53.600 --> 23:55.000
Come on, Becky.

24:10.920 --> 24:12.120
Okay.

24:12.520 --> 24:14.560
This is the end of the internal ladder.

24:15.400 --> 24:17.440
Each step at a time, okay? You got this.

24:19.120 --> 24:21.400
The next two hundred feet is external.

24:22.320 --> 24:24.310
I'm not gonna lie
it's gonna get a little bit crazy

24:24.394 --> 24:27.562
when we're out of the cage
in the open, but don't panic.

24:37.840 --> 24:38.760
Shit.

24:38.880 --> 24:40.000
Hunter?

24:40.560 --> 24:42.640
Hunter? Hunter?

24:42.960 --> 24:45.280
Becky, you gotta come up, it's so sick.

24:47.480 --> 24:48.400
Okay.

25:00.760 --> 25:01.800
Hunter?

25:02.080 --> 25:05.240
Out here, it's just like 200 feet more.
That's all.

25:05.360 --> 25:06.440
I can't.

25:07.080 --> 25:08.360
Yes, you can.

25:09.360 --> 25:11.840
Just look up, only up.

25:16.800 --> 25:19.080
You're doing great. You got this.

25:22.560 --> 25:23.600
Okay.

25:23.920 --> 25:25.080
Okay.

25:35.800 --> 25:36.840
Okay.

25:57.240 --> 25:58.920
Yeah, you're killing it.

26:04.200 --> 26:05.280
You okay?

26:06.720 --> 26:07.920
Remember, only look up.

26:14.360 --> 26:15.560
What the hell are we doing?

26:16.480 --> 26:19.160
Hey, stop overthinking.

26:19.440 --> 26:20.400
How?

26:20.520 --> 26:26.920
I don't know, concentrate on something else,
like, sing a nursery rhyme or some shit.

26:30.240 --> 26:32.800
Okay, okay.

26:34.033 --> 26:37.993
<i>♪ Ring-a-ring-a-rosies,
a pocket full of posies ♪</i>

26:38.800 --> 26:42.280
<i>♪ A tissue, a tissue, we all fall down ♪</i>

26:44.920 --> 26:46.320
I wouldn't have picked that one.

26:48.120 --> 26:49.080
Wow.

26:49.840 --> 26:54.000
Okay, Bex, this is gonna look
a little bit worse than it is.

26:55.080 --> 26:57.200
What the hell, Hunter?
Let's just go back down.

27:02.080 --> 27:06.120
Becky, if I let you
go back down, fear wins.

27:06.680 --> 27:08.840
And I'm not going to let that happen.

27:42.880 --> 27:43.840
It's okay, Bex.

27:46.120 --> 27:47.040
It's okay.

27:47.160 --> 27:48.120
I've got your weight.

27:50.480 --> 27:52.120
Thanks, okay.

28:02.760 --> 28:03.880
Okay.

28:09.560 --> 28:10.520
Reach with your arm.

28:10.640 --> 28:11.680
Okay.

28:19.400 --> 28:24.000
Okay, smooth our sailing to the top now.
You've got this.

28:26.520 --> 28:28.640
I actually really do hate you, Hunter.

28:29.400 --> 28:31.880
Hey, does this ladder feel a little slack?

28:35.600 --> 28:37.360
Stop, you dick, Hunter!

28:37.560 --> 28:38.520
Sorry.

28:45.200 --> 28:46.160
What was that?

28:48.240 --> 28:50.320
Come on, we're almost there

28:54.080 --> 28:55.560
-Come on.
-Okay.

29:29.880 --> 29:32.000
Becky, you're not gonna believe this,
you gotta pull up here.

29:32.120 --> 29:33.000
I'm coming.

29:33.120 --> 29:34.320
Okay. Okay.

29:34.680 --> 29:35.640
Okay.

29:42.600 --> 29:43.560
Hunter.

29:51.160 --> 29:52.640
Hey, trust me.

29:55.080 --> 29:56.400
Okay, okay.

30:00.840 --> 30:01.760
Becky.

30:07.320 --> 30:09.520
I'm here, oh, my God.

30:18.440 --> 30:19.560
Oh, my God.

30:20.360 --> 30:21.480
We did it, Bex.

30:21.600 --> 30:22.680
I knew you could.

30:44.920 --> 30:46.000
Here we go!

30:50.640 --> 30:52.440
On top of the goddamn world.

30:57.320 --> 30:58.360
Do you want to try?

31:00.560 --> 31:01.760
Shit, Hunter, stop.

31:01.880 --> 31:03.320
Just focus on getting a good shot.

31:03.840 --> 31:05.480
I didn't wear this stupid bra for nothing

31:05.600 --> 31:06.480
No.

31:06.600 --> 31:07.520
No, Hunter.

31:09.880 --> 31:11.040
Fly it around.

31:13.526 --> 31:15.046
Take your time.

31:15.160 --> 31:16.920
Okay, oh my God.

31:28.760 --> 31:29.680
How did it look?

31:29.960 --> 31:32.280
Insane. Insane. Crazy.

31:34.360 --> 31:36.000
Let's get this bad boy back.

31:36.720 --> 31:39.320
Holy shit, so sick, dude.

31:40.224 --> 31:43.664
Okay, now the ultimate, Bex, your turn.

31:48.920 --> 31:50.440
What? No.

31:50.560 --> 31:52.280
Do you wanna kick fear in the dick or not?

31:52.560 --> 31:54.680
No, no, Hunter.

31:56.080 --> 31:57.600
The old Becky would have done it.

31:59.440 --> 32:00.640
-Just saying.
-Dude.

32:01.800 --> 32:03.800
Here, I'll hold your hand

32:09.680 --> 32:10.880
-Okay.
-Yeah.

32:11.320 --> 32:12.280
Okay.

32:13.280 --> 32:14.200
Shit.

32:14.760 --> 32:16.200
Come on, come on.

32:17.720 --> 32:18.760
You can do this.

32:21.800 --> 32:22.840
You can do it.

32:23.680 --> 32:25.880
Okay, okay.

32:26.280 --> 32:27.200
I got you.

32:27.320 --> 32:28.360
Okay.

32:28.920 --> 32:29.840
Okay.

32:30.600 --> 32:31.520
You can trust me.

32:31.680 --> 32:32.840
-Okay.
-I've got you, Bex.

32:32.960 --> 32:34.040
Oh, my God.

32:35.000 --> 32:36.040
Careful over the ledge.

32:37.600 --> 32:38.560
Take it easy.

32:39.040 --> 32:41.640
Okay. I've got you. I've got you.

32:41.840 --> 32:42.760
Okay.

32:47.760 --> 32:48.920
Open your eyes.

32:50.880 --> 32:51.800
Look up.

32:59.400 --> 33:01.360
Okay, just one more.

33:06.200 --> 33:07.520
Come up.

33:12.040 --> 33:13.080
Oh my God, I did it.

33:13.200 --> 33:15.680
You did it, you idiot.

33:18.520 --> 33:19.520
Yes.

33:19.680 --> 33:22.680
-Look, look how amazing these are.
-Oh my God.

33:28.040 --> 33:30.720
Next time you are ever afraid of anything

33:31.240 --> 33:32.360
I want you to look at these,

33:32.680 --> 33:34.840
And know that you have nothing
to be afraid of.

33:36.360 --> 33:37.440
Thank you.

33:37.680 --> 33:38.640
Yeah.

33:39.200 --> 33:40.200
You know I'm proud of you.

33:41.640 --> 33:42.760
Dan would be too.

33:47.280 --> 33:48.320
Yeah.

33:55.880 --> 33:58.920
Okay, okay, it's time.

34:33.840 --> 34:36.440
You and I, we're one, Dan.

34:38.400 --> 34:43.480
And whenever I needed to laugh
you'd told me one of your shit jokes.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.600
And whenever I needed
a shoulder to cry on it was yours.

34:55.040 --> 34:57.000
And now you're gone and uhm...

35:00.320 --> 35:02.080
I don't feel whole anymore.

35:07.520 --> 35:10.600
I miss you, just so much and...

35:12.640 --> 35:14.000
I love you.

35:15.640 --> 35:16.720
Goodbye, Dan.

35:33.480 --> 35:34.400
Hey.

35:34.520 --> 35:35.600
Sorry.

35:36.680 --> 35:38.560
I just didn't expect
it to tip me like that.

35:39.600 --> 35:40.560
Yeah.

35:41.280 --> 35:43.120
It's been so far away for so long.

35:44.726 --> 35:46.286
It just didn't really feel real
until then.

35:51.880 --> 35:52.800
Come on.

35:53.320 --> 35:56.880
Let's get back down on Earth, okay?

35:58.320 --> 36:00.190
I don't know about
you but I really need to pee.

36:00.274 --> 36:02.516
I needed to pee
since we passed the Eiffel Tower.

36:03.520 --> 36:04.440
You okay?

36:04.920 --> 36:06.720
Okay, home time.

36:07.000 --> 36:08.080
Home time.

36:08.400 --> 36:10.240
-Harnesses?
-Harnesses.

36:15.000 --> 36:17.000
Think of the ice cold beers
waiting for us.

36:17.520 --> 36:18.680
Oh, stop.

36:20.800 --> 36:21.720
I've got you.

36:21.840 --> 36:23.000
Okay, slowly.

36:23.913 --> 36:25.953
Okay, I'm just gonna sit here.

36:26.600 --> 36:28.360
Okay. Okay.

36:45.600 --> 36:46.600
Okay.

37:02.800 --> 37:03.840
Hunter!

37:18.320 --> 37:19.440
No!

37:23.640 --> 37:26.320
Oh my God, oh my God, holy shit!

37:28.560 --> 37:30.560
-Don't let down!
-No, I've got you.

37:32.000 --> 37:33.000
Hunter!

37:40.920 --> 37:42.400
Oh, God, please don't let go off me.

37:46.840 --> 37:47.760
Don't let go.

37:59.760 --> 38:00.680
Bex?

38:05.840 --> 38:07.000
I've got you, Bex.

38:10.600 --> 38:11.840
I can see the ladder.

38:25.960 --> 38:27.000
I've got you.

38:31.520 --> 38:32.680
I just died almost.

38:36.240 --> 38:37.560
Oh, my God.

38:38.640 --> 38:42.360
-Did that really just happen? Oh, my God.
-Jesus Christ.

38:43.080 --> 38:44.360
I wish we'd filmed that.

38:46.200 --> 38:47.160
You're here.

38:47.280 --> 38:49.920
Let's get back on the ground
before I actually peed myself.

38:50.120 --> 38:51.040
Yeah.

38:51.280 --> 38:52.440
Okay, take two.

38:54.320 --> 38:55.240
Okay.

39:01.560 --> 39:03.486
Oh, no.

39:03.570 --> 39:06.320
The ladder, it's gone.

39:23.600 --> 39:25.200
Hunter, how are we gonna get down?

39:26.440 --> 39:27.680
-Shit.
-Please tell me there's a way to get down.

39:27.800 --> 39:29.880
There's nothing on the pole
I can get a foothold on.

39:30.000 --> 39:30.920
No.

39:31.040 --> 39:32.840
-Oh, no.
-No, no, no.

39:33.480 --> 39:35.440
There must be something.

39:37.680 --> 39:39.920
No, shit, I don't have a signal.

39:43.080 --> 39:44.160
I don't get it either.

39:45.012 --> 39:47.400
I'm sure there's something.
I'm sure it's just really spotty up here.

39:47.593 --> 39:49.553
No, we're too freaking high,
there's no signal up here.

39:49.680 --> 39:50.600
It'll be okay.

39:50.720 --> 39:53.360
Freaking out is not gonna help anything
right now, so just take a breath.

39:53.480 --> 39:56.480
We're stuck on the pizza-size platform
in the middle of nowhere., Hunter.

39:56.720 --> 39:58.400
Becky, freaking out
is not gonna help anything.

39:59.240 --> 40:02.040
It's not gonna help, okay? It's okay.

40:04.080 --> 40:07.200
-I'm sure we can...
-Wait, Hunter, Hunter, look at this.

40:08.080 --> 40:09.000
Oh, my God.

40:09.760 --> 40:10.720
Binoculars, that's amazing.

40:10.840 --> 40:11.760
Okay.

40:12.680 --> 40:13.640
We have a flair.

40:14.360 --> 40:15.280
Okay.

40:16.440 --> 40:18.200
-Okay.
-This is great.

40:18.360 --> 40:19.320
OK, great.

40:27.560 --> 40:29.600
Oh, shit, our bag is down there.

40:31.120 --> 40:32.960
Oh, man, our water is in there.

40:34.560 --> 40:36.040
Shit, we're gonna die of thirst.

40:36.160 --> 40:37.080
No, no.

40:37.207 --> 40:39.367
We don't have water, that is how
you die when you're stranded.

40:39.480 --> 40:41.880
The noise, the noise that this thing made
when it crashed,

40:42.160 --> 40:43.960
there is no way nobody heard that.

40:45.080 --> 40:49.400
I am sure that there are like
multiple calls to 911 as we speak.

40:50.320 --> 40:51.400
Do you really think so?

40:52.360 --> 40:53.280
Yeah.

40:53.400 --> 40:56.400
Yeah, the cavalry is coming, okay?
We just have to wait.

40:57.080 --> 40:58.520
Okay. Okay.

41:01.040 --> 41:01.960
Holy fuck.

41:02.080 --> 41:04.320
-What, what?
-Becky, your leg, oh, my God.

41:06.640 --> 41:09.440
What the hell? I didn't even notice this.

41:10.232 --> 41:12.392
Whoa.

41:12.666 --> 41:13.706
Give me your leg, let's do a tourniquet.*

41:14.320 --> 41:16.960
-It really hurts.
-Are you okay? I know, I'm sorry.

41:17.080 --> 41:18.640
-Can you warn me first?
-Okay.

41:19.000 --> 41:21.880
-Count to three or something.
-Okay, one, two, sorry.

41:22.240 --> 41:23.280
I'm really sorry.

41:23.480 --> 41:24.440
I know.

41:24.560 --> 41:25.640
-Oh, man.
-Are you okay?

41:26.560 --> 41:28.840
Yeah, I mean, I'm like okay, it's like...

41:33.099 --> 41:34.306
I really need to pee.

41:35.620 --> 41:36.740
-Just go.
-No.

41:37.000 --> 41:38.720
-Just go.
-No, it's fine, I can hold it.

41:39.560 --> 41:40.720
Just getting comfortable.

41:50.200 --> 41:52.040
Can you go any any further?
It's like spraying.

41:53.200 --> 41:55.120
-Okay, careful over the edge.
-I'm trying.

41:55.240 --> 41:56.360
Stop looking at me.

41:56.960 --> 41:58.440
Oh, God, that's a relief.

41:59.880 --> 42:01.640
I'm just grateful you didn't need to shit.

42:03.520 --> 42:05.305
Okay, we should find a way
to get comfortable

42:05.389 --> 42:07.359
cause I think
we gonna be up here for a while.

42:09.440 --> 42:10.440
All right?

42:14.960 --> 42:16.040
All right.

42:22.360 --> 42:23.720
Do you really think someone's coming?

42:25.720 --> 42:27.200
One million percent.

43:06.040 --> 43:09.480
<i>Hey, Danger D, what's happening, guys?</i>

43:09.640 --> 43:12.120
<i>I'll tell you what's happening, Becky C.</i>

43:12.240 --> 43:15.560
<i>We are stuck at the top
of a 2,000-foot tower</i>

43:15.680 --> 43:16.520
<i>with no way out.</i>

43:16.960 --> 43:19.880
<i>And I shot some of the best
goddamn footage of my life</i>

43:20.040 --> 43:21.000
<i>and no way to upload it.</i>

43:21.120 --> 43:23.040
<i>That's what worrying you
about the situation?</i>

43:24.040 --> 43:25.040
<i>It's quite ironic.</i>

43:25.440 --> 43:27.680
<i>Don't worry, you'll still be famous
if you fall.</i>

43:28.120 --> 43:31.320
<i>As the girl who died taking a selfie,
now that is ironic.</i>

43:31.840 --> 43:34.480
<i>I would like to be remembered
for my life, not my death.</i>

43:34.640 --> 43:38.120
<i>Thank you very much, #lifeoverdeath.</i>

43:38.240 --> 43:40.120
<i>#beckyisadickhole</i>

43:40.240 --> 43:43.440
<i>Hashtag, Hunter says she's doing
this YouTube thing for the money,</i>

43:43.560 --> 43:45.520
<i>but really I think
she's just a like-whore.</i>

43:46.240 --> 43:48.120
<i>-It's not like that.
-Okay, what is it like then?</i>

43:49.160 --> 43:52.160
<i>Come on, show us who you are,
show us Shilo Hunter.</i>

43:53.240 --> 43:54.600
<i>Tell us why you vlog.</i>

43:56.920 --> 43:59.640
<i>Okay, firstly, you're an asshole.</i>

44:00.720 --> 44:01.760
<i>Yeah.</i>

44:02.480 --> 44:03.520
<i>Secondly,</i>

44:08.560 --> 44:11.080
<i>And this is gonna sound stupid</i>

44:13.160 --> 44:14.320
<i>but I do this because of Dan.</i>

44:19.720 --> 44:23.840
What happened, it just made me realize
that life is fleeting.

44:26.880 --> 44:31.360
And I want to spread that message
that life is short, too short

44:31.480 --> 44:34.480
so you gotta use every moment,

44:34.600 --> 44:38.160
you gotta do something
that makes you feel alive.

44:48.280 --> 44:49.560
That was amazing.

44:51.360 --> 44:53.840
Wow, I mean, I told you
you should just be yourself.

44:53.960 --> 44:56.360
That was really great.

45:00.280 --> 45:01.480
Should I kill Danger D?

45:01.840 --> 45:04.480
I'll help you bury the body.

45:21.240 --> 45:24.520
Oh, shit, there's like an old
RV thing down there.

45:24.720 --> 45:25.640
Can I see?

45:25.960 --> 45:27.480
Just past the gate, a little over.

45:29.960 --> 45:32.560
Yeah, that looks abandoned.

45:34.720 --> 45:37.800
It's been five hours,
if anyone called 911 they'd be here by now.

45:54.800 --> 45:55.880
Oh, my God.

45:56.720 --> 45:57.920
Holy shit.

45:58.040 --> 46:00.440
Hold on, Becky,
we don't get service up here,

46:00.880 --> 46:02.360
but we definitely did down there,
remember?

46:02.480 --> 46:04.000
Remember, I got all those likes?

46:04.120 --> 46:05.040
Shit.

46:06.040 --> 46:06.960
Okay.

46:07.080 --> 46:08.800
Okay, so we don't know
at what point we lost service,

46:08.920 --> 46:09.823
maybe it was just up here

46:09.907 --> 46:13.116
because of some like interference
with the broadcast antenna.

46:13.200 --> 46:14.520
I think you're definitely
onto something, Hunter.

46:15.200 --> 46:16.520
Okay, we have 50 feet of rope.

46:16.840 --> 46:18.440
-We can try to fish for coverage.
-Yeah.

46:18.600 --> 46:20.560
I just need something to secure this with.

46:20.960 --> 46:22.720
-My hair tie.
-Yeah, perfect.

46:23.120 --> 46:24.040
Okay.

46:25.000 --> 46:25.920
Okay.

46:26.040 --> 46:27.240
Can you message emergency services?

46:27.680 --> 46:30.240
I don't think so,
but I have over 60,000 followers.

46:30.360 --> 46:31.280
Okay.

46:31.400 --> 46:37.440
Help us, stuck on B67 tower, call 911.

46:38.160 --> 46:39.360
It's ready to post.

46:39.480 --> 46:40.720
We should hear it when it sends.

46:47.120 --> 46:50.120
Come on, come on.

46:51.320 --> 46:53.600
Okay.

46:55.760 --> 46:57.480
Let me see if I can get it lower.

47:00.480 --> 47:01.720
Just be careful.

47:02.080 --> 47:03.240
-Got it.
-Okay.

47:03.760 --> 47:04.840
Come on.

47:10.120 --> 47:11.080
That's the end.

47:11.200 --> 47:13.000
-I didn't hear anything.
-I didn't either.

47:13.400 --> 47:14.520
I don't think it posted.

47:17.960 --> 47:19.120
Okay, maybe I can get it lower.

47:21.080 --> 47:22.160
What do you mean...

47:22.280 --> 47:23.360
I've got it. I've got an idea.

47:30.960 --> 47:31.920
Careful, Hunter.

47:32.280 --> 47:33.400
I feel solid.

47:35.200 --> 47:36.640
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm okay.

47:42.440 --> 47:43.520
Okay.

47:44.160 --> 47:45.840
-Oh, my God.
-Shit.

47:45.960 --> 47:47.720
You're full of shit, oh, my God, Hunter.

47:48.560 --> 47:49.920
-Are you okay?
-Yeah.

47:50.160 --> 47:51.160
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah.

47:54.320 --> 47:55.400
Careful, shit.

48:03.840 --> 48:05.240
I can not hear anything
no thing

48:05.360 --> 48:06.800
Okay, you need to come back up.

48:10.080 --> 48:11.040
Shit.

48:18.920 --> 48:19.880
I got it.

48:29.960 --> 48:31.120
Did it post?

48:32.480 --> 48:33.440
No.

48:34.520 --> 48:36.200
-What do we do now?
-I don't know.

48:39.800 --> 48:43.520
Wait, hold on. We know
there's a signal at the base, for sure.

48:43.720 --> 48:44.720
Yeah.

48:44.804 --> 48:45.911
What if we just drop the phone--

48:45.995 --> 48:48.196
but what if my phone
just shatters into a million pieces?

48:48.280 --> 48:51.280
Not if we reenforce it somehow
so it doesn't, like the eggdrop challenge.

48:51.440 --> 48:53.000
Yeah, okay, shit.

48:53.880 --> 48:55.600
We just need something to put in it.

48:55.720 --> 48:56.720
Yeah.

48:56.920 --> 48:57.840
This...

48:58.440 --> 48:59.400
It's melded on.

49:00.080 --> 49:01.240
My shoe is too clumsy.

49:01.560 --> 49:03.160
-Your shoe?
-Yeah, perfect.

49:05.120 --> 49:06.280
Okay, got it.

49:09.040 --> 49:09.960
We need some padding.

49:10.200 --> 49:11.320
Can we use your sock?

49:12.920 --> 49:14.520
Yeah, okay.

49:15.680 --> 49:16.600
Okay.

49:19.960 --> 49:21.600
We still need something more substantial.

49:22.840 --> 49:25.320
Oh, Hunter, your push-up bra.

49:25.920 --> 49:27.240
That is more substantial.

49:27.760 --> 49:29.640
-Yeah.
-I'm trying to get this thing off anyway.

49:31.760 --> 49:33.280
Thank you, VS.

49:35.640 --> 49:36.560
Okay.

49:36.760 --> 49:37.960
Hope it's strong enough.

49:38.120 --> 49:39.200
Shove it in, okay.

49:43.480 --> 49:44.440
Okay.

49:47.120 --> 49:48.160
Here comes nothing.

50:02.680 --> 50:04.840
-Did it work?
-I don't know, I can't tell.

50:19.520 --> 50:20.600
Do you see anything?

50:20.800 --> 50:22.280
No, nothing.

50:23.680 --> 50:24.640
Don't worry.

50:25.800 --> 50:26.960
They're coming.

50:33.160 --> 50:35.520
Holy shit, there's a freaking guy.

50:36.240 --> 50:38.240
-What?
-Oh, my God, yes!

50:38.360 --> 50:39.560
And a dog too.

50:41.280 --> 50:42.880
Hey, hey, help us!

50:43.000 --> 50:44.320
Up here!

50:46.800 --> 50:49.160
Look, I sent you the check, man, come on.

50:49.680 --> 50:50.800
I need that...

50:51.680 --> 50:52.600
Up here, boy.

50:59.000 --> 51:02.040
Parker, come on, boy.

51:02.840 --> 51:04.240
No no, no.

51:05.360 --> 51:08.640
Shit.

51:11.040 --> 51:12.120
Let's go

51:14.800 --> 51:16.440
Goddamn it, they're getting away.

51:30.280 --> 51:31.400
Parker?

51:33.400 --> 51:34.520
He saw the shoe.

51:34.840 --> 51:36.440
Hey, up here!

51:45.240 --> 51:47.680
-Hey!
-Look up!

51:54.440 --> 51:55.880
No, no, no, turn around.

51:56.000 --> 51:57.400
-Turn around, where are you going?
-Shit.

51:59.480 --> 52:00.720
Shit, shit.

52:00.960 --> 52:02.160
Help!

52:04.560 --> 52:06.360
Wait, wait, do not fire the flare.

52:06.480 --> 52:07.480
He's not looking.

52:07.760 --> 52:08.800
This might be our only chance.

52:08.920 --> 52:10.200
No, no, no, he stopped looking.

52:12.640 --> 52:15.360
Wait, hold on, there's somebody by the RV.

52:15.800 --> 52:18.120
He's setting up a grill or some shit.

52:18.280 --> 52:22.160
And we'll fire the flare when the sun
goes down, in like an hour.

52:22.280 --> 52:23.720
We've only got one shot at this.

52:25.440 --> 52:26.640
Oh, damn.

52:26.760 --> 52:27.720
What?

52:27.840 --> 52:29.320
They're making ribs.

52:29.440 --> 52:31.480
-Oh, no.
-And they have a really cold beer.

52:31.600 --> 52:32.720
Stop.

52:47.880 --> 52:49.560
These guys are definitely a couple.

52:51.240 --> 52:52.640
Dirty weekend away.

52:53.520 --> 52:54.360
I'm jealous.

53:11.560 --> 53:13.560
Hey, they're finishing up.

53:14.200 --> 53:15.320
It's now or never, fire the flare.

53:15.520 --> 53:16.400
Is it dark enough?

53:16.520 --> 53:17.440
Uhuh.

53:17.840 --> 53:18.800
Okay.

53:20.009 --> 53:22.089
-Shit.
-Shit, what the hell. Why is it not firing?

53:22.173 --> 53:24.093
I fired it, I cocked it,
but maybe there's a safety here--

53:24.607 --> 53:26.967
Shit, okay, they're going in,
you have to do the flare now.

53:27.080 --> 53:28.120
-I'm trying.
-Get it to go.

53:28.320 --> 53:29.280
Okay, I got it, I got it.

53:35.800 --> 53:37.542
Hey, Randy, come check this shit out.

53:37.840 --> 53:38.800
Okay, give me your phone.

53:39.520 --> 53:40.360
Okay.

53:41.960 --> 53:44.080
Hey, sons of bitches, out here!

53:44.920 --> 53:46.640
Holy shit, check this out.

53:48.086 --> 53:49.206
Up here!

53:49.360 --> 53:50.240
They're looking at us.

53:50.440 --> 53:51.280
-What?
-They can see us.

53:51.480 --> 53:52.440
Oh, my God!

53:52.640 --> 53:55.280
Shit, oh, my God, let me see. Let me see.

53:56.320 --> 53:57.640
Oh my God, they're coming.

54:03.760 --> 54:04.920
Holy shit, they found the car.

54:05.080 --> 54:06.440
They found our car, they found our car.

54:09.272 --> 54:10.752
They have a crowbar.

54:10.880 --> 54:11.840
They probably can open the gate.

54:13.440 --> 54:14.480
-Okay.
-Okay.

54:14.760 --> 54:15.680
Wait, what the hell?

54:15.800 --> 54:16.880
Wait, what's going on?

54:17.320 --> 54:18.160
They stopped.

54:18.640 --> 54:20.640
-What?
-Quit chatting, open the freaking gate!

54:21.560 --> 54:22.440
No.

54:22.560 --> 54:25.280
No, what the hell?
They stealing my freaking car.

54:25.480 --> 54:27.360
-What?
-No, you sons of bitches!

54:27.720 --> 54:30.160
-No!
-You asshole, what the hell?

54:30.480 --> 54:32.009
-No.
-I have to see this.

54:34.040 --> 54:35.080
Oh, my God.

54:35.359 --> 54:36.752
-No!
-Assholes!

55:26.800 --> 55:28.960
Okay, new rule.

55:30.440 --> 55:32.080
If somebody falls off the tower

55:32.680 --> 55:34.160
they bring the cell phone with them.

55:34.760 --> 55:36.160
And call for help on the way down.

55:38.840 --> 55:40.160
And maybe post that video.

55:41.960 --> 55:42.960
I'm kidding.

55:47.840 --> 55:51.080
Yeah, my leg, I could eat Aspirin
like Skittles right now.

55:52.738 --> 55:55.917
Yeah, looks like
it's getting a little funky.

55:56.023 --> 55:58.378
You could use some washing, here.

56:09.080 --> 56:10.120
Sorry.

56:19.760 --> 56:21.000
We'll just keep it wrapped up.

56:24.240 --> 56:25.200
What's wrong?

56:28.920 --> 56:30.760
Dan could never say
the words "I love you."

56:34.163 --> 56:35.416
143.

56:40.120 --> 56:41.320
143.

56:46.960 --> 56:47.960
Becky, I...

56:48.080 --> 56:49.120
How long?

56:52.960 --> 56:53.960
Four months.

56:59.120 --> 57:00.280
It was a huge mistake.

57:01.680 --> 57:04.960
I'm sorry, I am so, so sorry.

57:05.160 --> 57:07.640
For sleeping with my husband
or me finding out about it?

57:07.760 --> 57:09.440
For falling in love with the same guy.

57:40.320 --> 57:41.320
Who made the move?

57:42.880 --> 57:44.480
-We were both super drunk.
-Who?

57:47.640 --> 57:48.560
He did.

57:50.600 --> 57:54.200
But it was a huge, huge mistake, Bex.

57:57.520 --> 57:58.600
No.

57:59.760 --> 58:01.880
Mistake is a kiss or a one-night stand.

58:03.720 --> 58:05.560
You said you'd loved him, so...

58:08.960 --> 58:10.120
It got out of hand.

58:10.520 --> 58:14.240
I tried so hard not to
but I fell for him.

58:15.379 --> 58:16.960
He listened to me, he was...

58:18.320 --> 58:21.080
He was just different than every other
douchebag that I've ever dated.

58:23.243 --> 58:25.240
And I had never felt that way before.

58:27.600 --> 58:29.043
And then you asked me
to be your maid of honor

58:29.250 --> 58:32.650
and it all hit me like a ton of bricks
how messed up this all was.

58:34.600 --> 58:36.360
I loved him but...

58:38.360 --> 58:40.600
But I love you more so I ended it.

58:44.800 --> 58:46.760
It was just so hard
seeing you guys together.

58:48.840 --> 58:50.280
And after Dan died, I...

58:51.320 --> 58:54.600
I just didn't have the strength
to be there for you.

58:54.720 --> 58:56.720
To be strong enough for you, so...

58:57.960 --> 58:59.040
So I ran away.

59:00.960 --> 59:02.920
And now you hate me and I don't blame you.

59:03.040 --> 59:05.480
And now we're stuck
on this stupid freaking tower

59:05.600 --> 59:09.520
in the middle of freaking nowhere,
and it's all my fault.

59:11.520 --> 59:14.200
I am so, so sorry.

01:00:25.600 --> 01:00:26.800
What's that?

01:00:27.800 --> 01:00:30.120
I set it when we dropped
the phone down yesterday.

01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:33.840
It's been 24 hours.

01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:40.520
I think its time to accept that either
your 60,000 followers don't give a shit

01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:42.400
or your phone is down there
in a million pieces.

01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:49.160
Okay, well, we've got
one more shot, your phone.

01:00:49.720 --> 01:00:52.320
Yeah, no padding this time though,
even less of a chance.

01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:54.120
And if this fails
we really don't have any hope.

01:00:58.280 --> 01:00:59.960
How long till we die of thirst?

01:01:01.360 --> 01:01:04.520
It's just killing me that our water
is just right down there in that bag.

01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:07.400
Yeah, with the drone.

01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:10.040
We could have used that
to get help.

01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:13.640
We could have flown it back to our motel
with a good old-fashioned note.

01:01:19.720 --> 01:01:20.840
Hey, maybe I can get it.

01:01:22.680 --> 01:01:24.960
What do you mean?
You said it was too smooth, no footholds.

01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:27.000
Yeah, but when I hung
my cell down yesterday

01:01:27.120 --> 01:01:28.920
I think the rope
was long enough to reach it.

01:01:31.960 --> 01:01:33.240
-Are you serious?
-Yeah.

01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:36.800
Yeah, I seriously think I can get it.

01:01:45.640 --> 01:01:47.440
Hunter, I don't think this is a good idea.

01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:49.000
Becky, I don't think we have a choice.

01:01:50.240 --> 01:01:51.880
Every hour that passes the weaker we get.

01:01:56.640 --> 01:01:59.960
Besides, maybe I get lucky and I'll fall.

01:02:11.160 --> 01:02:12.080
Hunter.

01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:16.640
Be careful.

01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:20.520
I'm sorry, Bex.

01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:23.400
I love you.

01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:36.360
Okay.

01:02:45.280 --> 01:02:46.640
Hunter, are you okay?

01:02:47.920 --> 01:02:48.840
Yeah.

01:02:49.960 --> 01:02:51.000
Yeah, all good.

01:02:58.920 --> 01:02:59.767
Okay.

01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:07.640
Okay.

01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:16.200
Hunter, be careful.

01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:19.040
Shit.

01:03:20.200 --> 01:03:21.840
I can't quite reach it.

01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:24.440
Just come back up and we'll tap it lower.

01:03:24.560 --> 01:03:25.520
Come on.

01:03:25.800 --> 01:03:26.720
Shit.

01:03:30.600 --> 01:03:31.880
I think I can drop myself lower.

01:03:32.240 --> 01:03:33.080
What?

01:03:34.440 --> 01:03:35.880
What the hell are you doing, Hunter?

01:03:37.960 --> 01:03:38.720
Hunter?

01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:46.960
Shit.

01:03:54.760 --> 01:03:56.280
I think I can swing to it.

01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.160
Hunter, no, Hunter.

01:03:58.520 --> 01:03:59.200
Come back up.

01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:00.640
Hunter, no!

01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:01.920
Hunter!

01:04:08.280 --> 01:04:09.280
Are you okay?

01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:12.800
Yeah.

01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:18.680
Is there a way down?

01:04:19.480 --> 01:04:21.960
No, the ladder ripped all the way off.

01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:34.400
Water.

01:04:38.080 --> 01:04:38.960
Oh, my God.

01:04:39.080 --> 01:04:39.960
Wait, Hunter,

01:04:40.680 --> 01:04:42.200
how are you gonna get back on the rope?

01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:49.080
Shit.

01:04:51.680 --> 01:04:52.880
Can you reach it?

01:05:03.320 --> 01:05:05.720
<i>♪ Humpty Dumpty sat on a wall ♪</i>

01:05:06.880 --> 01:05:07.920
Oh, my God.

01:05:08.200 --> 01:05:10.520
<i>♪ Humpty Dumpty had a great fall ♪</i>

01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:23.920
Shit.

01:05:28.440 --> 01:05:29.480
You okay?

01:05:29.680 --> 01:05:31.760
Yeah, I have an idea.

01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:42.280
Okay.

01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:44.640
I'm gonna try to hook it on with this.

01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.160
And then we're gonna work together
to pull me up, okay?

01:05:48.360 --> 01:05:52.000
That's amazing, that's
some good MacGyver shit right there.

01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:20.760
Come on, please, come on.

01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:22.280
Please, come on.

01:06:24.840 --> 01:06:25.800
You did it!

01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:27.600
Okay. Okay.

01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:29.560
I'm gonna jump onto this.

01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.760
I'm gonna need your help to pull me up.

01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:33.360
I think I'm ready, Bex.

01:06:33.480 --> 01:06:34.600
Okay.

01:06:36.320 --> 01:06:37.280
Okay.

01:06:40.520 --> 01:06:42.760
Okay, come on, come on
Come on, you can do it.

01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:52.800
Shit.

01:06:52.920 --> 01:06:54.760
Hunter, are you okay? You okay?

01:06:58.200 --> 01:06:59.920
I'm okay. I'm okay.

01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:01.920
Let's do this fast and quick, Becky.

01:07:02.120 --> 01:07:04.160
-We'll work together to pull me out.
-Okay.

01:07:04.280 --> 01:07:07.480
I climb, you pull, okay?

01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:09.800
Okay, now.

01:07:39.400 --> 01:07:41.040
I can almost reach the ladder.

01:07:46.080 --> 01:07:47.480
Almost there, Bex.

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:55.320
Okay.

01:08:25.439 --> 01:08:27.479
Becky, I landed on the bag.

01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:29.319
Oh, my God, are you okay?

01:08:29.960 --> 01:08:33.160
I hurt my hands, real bad,
I don't think I can climb.

01:08:33.319 --> 01:08:34.880
You're gonna have to pull me up, okay?

01:08:35.080 --> 01:08:36.439
Okay. Okay.

01:08:39.960 --> 01:08:41.080
I got you.

01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:18.200
Shit.

01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:22.600
No, are you okay?

01:09:23.279 --> 01:09:24.200
Yeah.

01:09:24.319 --> 01:09:25.399
I thought you died there.

01:09:25.840 --> 01:09:27.040
I'm not going anywhere, Bex.

01:09:28.359 --> 01:09:30.000
Yeah, that was scary.

01:09:37.319 --> 01:09:38.319
We should ration it.

01:09:39.122 --> 01:09:40.015
Yeah, you're right.

01:09:41.319 --> 01:09:42.359
Is there food in there?

01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:45.040
No, it's just your cherry lip balm.

01:09:45.880 --> 01:09:47.080
I don't think you can eat that.

01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:49.800
Okay, it's getting dark.

01:09:49.920 --> 01:09:51.240
I think it's now or never on that drone.

01:09:52.840 --> 01:09:55.200
I think we need...
We need to write a note.

01:09:56.360 --> 01:09:57.600
Okay, the receipt from the diner.

01:09:58.520 --> 01:09:59.760
Pen, do you have a pen?

01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:00.880
Eyeliner in here.

01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:03.120
Aren't you glad I brought makeup now?

01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:07.440
Help.

01:10:07.600 --> 01:10:12.560
Stuck on top of B67 tower. Call 911.

01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:14.040
Okay.

01:10:14.520 --> 01:10:15.480
Yeah, perfect.

01:10:19.720 --> 01:10:20.680
Okay.

01:10:20.880 --> 01:10:21.880
See that?

01:10:22.040 --> 01:10:25.440
That's the road where we almost got
wiped out. It leads to the motel.

01:10:26.800 --> 01:10:28.200
Let's do this while we still have light.

01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:33.240
Okay.

01:10:35.920 --> 01:10:39.400
Okay, just keep it straight
and follow the line of the rode...

01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:40.600
Okay.

01:10:55.280 --> 01:10:56.960
Okay, we're almost past the gate.

01:10:57.960 --> 01:10:59.240
-Oh my God, no, no.
-What?

01:10:59.433 --> 01:11:01.873
-The battery, it's running out of juice.
-Shit.

01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:04.160
Hit "retrieve." Has it gone too far?

01:11:04.640 --> 01:11:06.200
-Is it gonna make it?
-There's no chance.

01:11:06.513 --> 01:11:08.113
-Are you sure?
-It's not even at the gate.

01:11:08.247 --> 01:11:09.447
Oh, shit, it's falling.

01:11:09.553 --> 01:11:10.793
Hit "retrieve," hit "retrieve".

01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:11.880
Okay.

01:11:12.979 --> 01:11:14.459
-It's coming back.
-Fly it high.

01:11:14.600 --> 01:11:16.080
Give it your best shot
to get it back to us.

01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:18.000
Come on, just get it higher,
higher, higher.

01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:21.640
-Just get it higher.
-I'm trying.

01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:23.800
We'll grab it when it gets close.

01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:24.920
Okay.

01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:32.360
Okay, grab it, Bex. Get it!

01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:37.960
Nice, great job.

01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:51.960
We have a charger,
but we don't have any power.

01:11:53.160 --> 01:11:55.920
Maybe just turn it off
and once it's rested it'll have more juice?

01:11:56.200 --> 01:11:58.400
It's never gonna be enough, Hunter.

01:12:07.880 --> 01:12:08.880
What are we gonna do?

01:12:09.560 --> 01:12:10.960
Hey, we're not gonna panic.

01:12:11.920 --> 01:12:13.160
We're gonna stay calm.

01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:15.080
We're gonna figure it out.

01:12:15.600 --> 01:12:16.840
Okay, there's gotta be a way.

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:21.840
Are we gonna die?

01:12:22.560 --> 01:12:25.360
No, we're gonna be okay.

01:12:53.920 --> 01:12:55.160
Hunter? Hunter?

01:12:56.280 --> 01:12:57.600
Where are you? Hunter?

01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:06.000
Hunter?

01:13:07.480 --> 01:13:08.840
Hunter, where are you?

01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:14.200
Hunter.

01:13:14.560 --> 01:13:15.720
Hunter?

01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:18.840
Becky, it's okay,
you just had a bad dream.

01:14:19.800 --> 01:14:21.520
You're nice and safe.

01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.480
Two thousand feet up
in the middle of nowhere.

01:14:33.400 --> 01:14:34.480
I have an idea.

01:14:35.520 --> 01:14:36.800
How to charge the drone.

01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:39.600
Your dumb lifehack.

01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:42.720
Becky, you're freaking genius.

01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:51.960
I think it's light enough now.
Let's do it.

01:15:10.953 --> 01:15:13.753
Okay, it's a standard bulb fitting,
it's gonna be hot.

01:15:14.240 --> 01:15:16.520
It's 30 feet
but it's gonna feel like a thousand.

01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:21.640
-Is your leg okay?
-Yeah.

01:15:22.520 --> 01:15:25.040
It smells, but it doesn't
hurt anymore, it's fine.

01:15:26.560 --> 01:15:27.640
Okay.

01:15:31.320 --> 01:15:32.320
You can do this.

01:15:41.120 --> 01:15:42.160
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

01:15:46.080 --> 01:15:47.400
Keep going, Becky.

01:15:52.200 --> 01:15:53.240
You can do this, Becky.

01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:04.840
I can't.

01:16:05.200 --> 01:16:06.240
It's okay, it's okay.

01:16:06.360 --> 01:16:07.320
I can't.

01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:09.520
You can do it, Becky.

01:16:10.280 --> 01:16:11.480
You got it.

01:16:14.880 --> 01:16:17.680
It's okay, it's just like pole dancing.

01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:20.640
Okay, "Cherry Pie."

01:16:21.200 --> 01:16:23.840
<i>♪ She's my cherry pie ♪</i>

01:16:23.960 --> 01:16:27.000
<i>♪ Cool drink of water,
such a sweet surprise ♪</i>

01:16:27.120 --> 01:16:29.360
<i>♪ She's my cherry pie ♪</i>

01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:36.960
<i>♪ She's my cherry pie ♪</i>

01:16:37.200 --> 01:16:39.360
<i>♪ Cool drink of water,
such a sweet surprise ♪</i>

01:16:40.440 --> 01:16:42.720
<i>♪ She's my cherry pie ♪</i>

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:45.480
Becky's my cherry pie.

01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:48.000
Yes.

01:16:56.680 --> 01:16:59.240
Okay. Okay.

01:16:59.413 --> 01:17:00.573
Yeah.

01:17:00.680 --> 01:17:02.360
You did it, my cherry pie!

01:17:04.600 --> 01:17:05.640
Okay.

01:17:06.600 --> 01:17:08.200
-Okay.
-Remember it's hot.

01:17:08.320 --> 01:17:09.200
Okay. Okay.

01:17:11.400 --> 01:17:12.320
Be careful.

01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:32.040
Okay, just think back to the diner.

01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:34.719
You'll gonna wanna align
the prongs of the charger

01:17:34.803 --> 01:17:37.380
with the element in the bulb socket.

01:17:42.240 --> 01:17:43.520
I don't think it's long enough.

01:17:44.200 --> 01:17:45.880
I think the back prong doesn't reach.

01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:50.040
Okay, you're gonna need something small
and metal to carry the current, like...

01:17:50.520 --> 01:17:53.040
Like a screw or something
you can jam in there.

01:17:53.800 --> 01:17:55.360
-There isn't anything.
-Jesus.

01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:26.400
It's working, it's freaking working.

01:18:26.640 --> 01:18:28.000
Holy shit, my hero.

01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:30.680
Okay, we're gonna need a full charge.

01:18:30.800 --> 01:18:33.360
I don't know, it just has four lights.

01:18:33.640 --> 01:18:37.000
Okay, we have to charge it all the way,
give ourselves the best shot.

01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:38.520
You gonna be okay?

01:18:38.960 --> 01:18:41.240
Yeah, I got this.

01:19:10.280 --> 01:19:11.440
You okay?

01:19:12.600 --> 01:19:13.680
Yeah.

01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.200
Hang in there, Bex.

01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:17.840
Passed half way.

01:19:38.480 --> 01:19:39.400
here about me

01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:50.080
It's okay, it's okay,
Becky, you've got it.

01:19:51.800 --> 01:19:53.040
Three lights.

01:19:57.320 --> 01:19:59.080
Come on, Becky, you're so close.

01:20:07.120 --> 01:20:08.120
Get away from me!

01:20:14.200 --> 01:20:15.240
You did it.

01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:21.360
Jesus, I'm so proud of you.

01:20:25.680 --> 01:20:26.880
Why didn't you catch the bag?

01:20:29.041 --> 01:20:30.848
Babe, you're okay?

01:20:36.840 --> 01:20:39.560
We need to fly that thing
when the motel is the busiest.

01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:43.960
Check out, 10 a.m, just a couple of hours.

01:21:11.560 --> 01:21:14.640
Yeah, he was right about Dan,
he was just trying to help me.

01:21:17.907 --> 01:21:19.680
and I was so horrible to him.

01:21:22.956 --> 01:21:25.396
If there was anyone
I could text it'd be him.

01:21:25.480 --> 01:21:29.520
Just to tell him I'm so sorry.

01:21:31.920 --> 01:21:33.320
I love him.

01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:41.120
I'm tapping outta here.

01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:45.840
Stay with me,
try to keep your mind occupied.

01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:51.200
Tell me something, something
that you and your dad used to do together.

01:21:54.960 --> 01:21:56.440
We would watch wrestling.

01:21:57.960 --> 01:21:59.120
WWE.

01:21:59.240 --> 01:22:02.200
Yeah, I forgot you guys were into that.

01:22:03.080 --> 01:22:04.000
Yeah.

01:22:04.440 --> 01:22:05.640
We both like it, you know.**

01:22:06.640 --> 01:22:11.240
He always said I'd be world champion
with my fighting spirit.

01:22:12.880 --> 01:22:15.120
I always felt so close to him
when we were watching it.

01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:20.720
Name some of your favorite wrestlers.

01:22:24.080 --> 01:22:26.600
Stone Cold - Steve Austin.

01:22:28.440 --> 01:22:29.480
The Rock.

01:22:30.560 --> 01:22:33.760
What was Cactus Jack's name
when he was wearing a mask?

01:22:34.040 --> 01:22:35.240
Mankind.

01:22:36.720 --> 01:22:38.040
Mankind.

01:22:39.880 --> 01:22:41.720
Wait, I thought you said
you didn't watch it.

01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:42.960
I didn't.

01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:45.040
Keep going, you need to stay awake.

01:22:47.920 --> 01:22:48.920
Batista.

01:22:49.200 --> 01:22:50.576
sub.T

01:22:54.960 --> 01:22:56.680
Okay, it's check out time.

01:23:00.280 --> 01:23:01.360
Here it goes.

01:23:08.566 --> 01:23:11.246
Just keep that shit straight,
follow the line of the road.

01:23:16.600 --> 01:23:18.000
Come on, you son of a...

01:23:24.120 --> 01:23:28.640
We've passed the point of no return.
How's the battery? Should I retrieve?

01:23:29.240 --> 01:23:30.920
No, keep going.

01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:36.000
Come on, come on, just follow the road.

01:23:43.200 --> 01:23:44.160
Oh, shit.

01:23:50.680 --> 01:23:51.760
It's gonna work.

01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:02.080
Oh, God.

01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:11.360
No. Screw your truck, get the drone!
Get it!

01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:20.160
No, no, come back.

01:24:21.720 --> 01:24:24.080
No, no.

01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:25.160
No, come back.

01:24:25.440 --> 01:24:26.520
Come back.

01:24:27.920 --> 01:24:29.120
No.

01:24:31.579 --> 01:24:33.472
Fuck, no!

01:25:20.360 --> 01:25:21.680
Is this a storm?

01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:25.760
It's kinda beautiful from up here.

01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:33.840
I can't survive another night.

01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:35.600
Becky, don't talk like that.

01:25:39.600 --> 01:25:42.200
I just want to sleep.

01:25:42.360 --> 01:25:43.520
You can't sleep.

01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:45.920
The vultures, they can smell your leg.

01:25:46.600 --> 01:25:48.560
They're waiting for you to give up
so they can attack.

01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:53.960
Survival of the fittest.

01:25:55.200 --> 01:25:58.480
You need energy, we should eat something.

01:25:59.240 --> 01:26:00.200
What?

01:26:01.313 --> 01:26:04.257
We're 2,000 feet up
in the middle of the desert

01:26:04.348 --> 01:26:05.842
There's no food up here.

01:26:06.280 --> 01:26:07.240
There is always something.

01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:12.163
It's hopeless.

01:26:16.394 --> 01:26:17.867
Let's send another message.

01:26:18.640 --> 01:26:20.720
We can pad the cell better this time.

01:26:21.120 --> 01:26:22.040
With what?

01:26:22.160 --> 01:26:23.120
Give me your shoe.

01:26:23.560 --> 01:26:25.360
-I can't.
-Why?

01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:27.080
It's not up here, is it?

01:26:27.320 --> 01:26:28.440
What?

01:26:30.840 --> 01:26:31.840
It's down there.

01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:34.920
It's on your foot.

01:26:36.520 --> 01:26:37.836
Yes.

01:26:39.430 --> 01:26:41.190
But I am...

01:26:42.121 --> 01:26:45.131
down there, remember?

01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:51.800
I fell.

01:26:55.200 --> 01:26:57.160
You can't have the shoe

01:26:57.960 --> 01:26:59.800
because I didn't catch the bag.

01:27:00.920 --> 01:27:02.160
I bled out.

01:27:19.000 --> 01:27:22.320
You didn't really think your scrawny ass
could pull me up, did you?

01:27:35.760 --> 01:27:37.040
You pulled the bag up.

01:27:46.120 --> 01:27:51.279
I guess you were just too afraid
to realize that you were up here

01:27:51.439 --> 01:27:53.226
all alone.

01:29:05.720 --> 01:29:10.920
<i>Hi Dad, I wanted you to know that I...</i>

01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:13.680
<i>I found my fight again.</i>

01:29:17.880 --> 01:29:19.280
<i>Please leave your message.</i>

01:29:20.680 --> 01:29:24.960
<i>I wanna live, I wanna go home.</i>

01:29:27.720 --> 01:29:29.520
<i>But I'm not gonna make it.</i>

01:29:35.480 --> 01:29:37.960
<i>You were right about everything and I...</i>

01:29:39.400 --> 01:29:40.840
<i>I'm sorry, Dad.</i>

01:29:42.880 --> 01:29:46.600
Becky, call me when you're ready,
I'm here for you, Dad.

01:29:46.720 --> 01:29:48.560
<i>By the time you see this</i>

01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:52.400
<i>I'll be gone.</i>

01:30:00.360 --> 01:30:01.360
<i>I love you.</i>

01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:34.720
thus

01:31:58.920 --> 01:32:02.520
<i>You need energy, you should eat something.</i>

01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:08.920
<i>Survival of the fittest.</i>

01:32:44.720 --> 01:32:46.880
<i>I can pad the cell better this time.</i>

01:32:48.200 --> 01:32:49.360
<i>Give me your shoe.</i>

01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:06.120
Hunter.

01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:21.040
God, I love you.

01:34:34.520 --> 01:34:37.320
Help, stuck on the B67 tower,
I love you Dad, Becky.

01:34:53.080 --> 01:34:54.240
I'm sorry.

01:34:54.920 --> 01:34:58.160
I'm so sorry, but I really have to
make sure this gets through.

01:34:58.440 --> 01:35:00.000
God, God, I'm sorry.

01:36:16.760 --> 01:36:17.800
You can't walk here.

01:36:17.920 --> 01:36:20.200
Becky, Becky?

01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:29.640
No, no.

01:36:32.480 --> 01:36:37.720
Dad? Dad? Dad.

01:36:44.440 --> 01:36:45.520
Jesus, I thought that was you.

01:36:46.840 --> 01:36:48.160
Dad, I love you.

01:36:48.320 --> 01:36:50.200
And I'm so sorry.

01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:57.480
It's okay, I just want you to be okay.

01:37:01.840 --> 01:37:06.200
I am, you know. I'm gonna be okay, really.

01:37:21.760 --> 01:37:22.920
Let's go home.

01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:26.920
<i>Life is fleeting.</i>

01:37:28.080 --> 01:37:31.120
<i>Life is short, too short.</i>

01:37:31.520 --> 01:37:34.120
<i>So you gotta use every moment.</i>

01:37:34.800 --> 01:37:37.360
<i>You have to do something
that makes you feel alive,</i>

01:37:37.920 --> 01:37:41.920
<i>and that shit,
that would spread that message</i>

01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:43.600
<i>far and wide.</i>
