51:22.624 --> 51:23.876
All my relations.

52:46.625 --> 52:47.626
Hey uncle.

52:48.335 --> 52:51.922
Got room for three more in there?

53:23.495 --> 53:24.997
I'm Pasmay.

53:28.959 --> 53:31.086
I saw you dancing at a pow wow last year.

56:38.273 --> 56:39.525
Nice job <i>son</i> !

56:40.526 --> 56:42.152
No one noticed I was there!

58:41.522 --> 58:43.899
I'm gonna regret this.

1:00:23.790 --> 1:00:25.542
You're smarter than you look.

1:00:26.168 --> 1:00:28.629
Mother Mary's ready to see you now.

1:01:10.671 --> 1:01:11.713
Come in.

1:01:12.089 --> 1:01:13.131
Welcome.

1:01:14.091 --> 1:01:15.175
My goodness!

1:01:27.938 --> 1:01:29.481
This is Lincoln.

1:01:30.941 --> 1:01:31.775
Sit.

1:01:38.824 --> 1:01:41.326
Lincoln here is looking for his mother.

1:01:41.451 --> 1:01:43.704
Thinks she might work here.

1:01:47.499 --> 1:01:49.918
A lot of mothers work for me.

1:02:00.512 --> 1:02:03.223
Come, let's have a look at you.

1:02:11.106 --> 1:02:13.108
I know those eyes.

1:02:19.156 --> 1:02:20.991
Caused me lots of problems though.

1:02:51.021 --> 1:02:52.856
Your friend's quite rude.

1:02:54.775 --> 1:02:57.069
You should let him know where Sarah is.

1:16:02.145 --> 1:16:05.107
You act angry all the time...

1:16:06.191 --> 1:16:09.570
...and maybe you are, but you have a big heart.

1:16:09.695 --> 1:16:15.242
You care more than anyone I know.

1:18:18.699 --> 1:18:19.533
I'm sorry.

1:24:02.835 --> 1:24:04.211
Yo where you from man?

1:24:04.336 --> 1:24:05.462
Cape Breton.

1:24:09.758 --> 1:24:11.218
What are you doing?

1:24:11.718 --> 1:24:13.345
We're just playing around.

1:24:14.054 --> 1:24:16.098
This isn't how we greet guests.

1:24:16.223 --> 1:24:17.599
Come over here.

1:24:19.434 --> 1:24:20.853
Here's some money.

1:24:20.978 --> 1:24:24.064
Go to the store and get things for supper.

1:24:25.274 --> 1:24:26.483
All of you come with me.

1:24:27.943 --> 1:24:29.570
It's okay, come with me.

1:32:59.246 --> 1:33:02.332
My name is Lincoln.

1:33:04.001 --> 1:33:05.669
I'm your son.

1:39:50.282 --> 1:39:51.200
I love you.
