- OH, WHAT FRIEND?

12:01.709 --> 12:04.375
- WHAT, ARE YOU MOM NOW?

12:04.375 --> 12:05.875
YOU WANT TO DO LUNCH?

12:05.875 --> 12:08.041
- I THINK I'M GONNA
BE DINING ON BACKLOG.

12:08.041 --> 12:09.792
AND PAYING A VISIT
TO BOYD'S HOUSE.

12:09.792 --> 12:11.583
- HMM.

12:11.583 --> 12:13.709
ALL RIGHT, WELL, I'LL BRING
YOU SOMETHING BACK.

12:13.709 --> 12:16.750
BYE.

12:23.375 --> 12:24.750
- WAIT A SECOND.

12:24.750 --> 12:28.542
- WHAT?

12:28.542 --> 12:30.709
- GIVE ME YOUR OPINION
AS A FEMALE.

12:30.709 --> 12:34.000
- AS A FEMALE?
- AS A WOMAN, YOU KNOW?

12:34.000 --> 12:37.041
MCCOURT.

12:37.041 --> 12:38.583
- WHAT ABOUT HIM?

12:38.583 --> 12:39.959
- DO YOU FIND HIM ATTRACTIVE?

12:39.959 --> 12:43.875
- DO YOU?

12:43.875 --> 12:44.792
- I MEAN, WOULD YOU EVER?

12:44.792 --> 12:47.208
- I WOULD RATHER
PUT A CAMPFIRE OUT

12:47.208 --> 12:49.709
WITH MY FACE.

12:49.709 --> 12:51.166
OKAY?

12:51.166 --> 12:52.750
I CHECKED IN WITH CIRA.

12:52.750 --> 12:54.750
SHE'S GONNA STAY ON
THE ATM VIDEO SURVEILLANCE

12:54.750 --> 12:56.542
WHILE I TRACK DOWN
THE TATTOO.

12:56.542 --> 12:59.417
- LET ME SEE THAT AGAIN.

12:59.417 --> 13:01.208
SEE, IT STILL LOOKS
LIKE A UFO TO ME.

13:01.208 --> 13:03.083
- WHO THE FUCK KNOWS, RIGHT?
- YEAH.

13:03.083 --> 13:04.041
- WE NEED TO TALK TO AN EXPERT.

13:04.041 --> 13:07.041
- AN EXPERT, HUH?
- MM-HMM.

13:12.917 --> 13:15.333
- THE DRAGON LADY REPRESENTS
THE DUALITIES

13:15.333 --> 13:18.458
OF MY INNER WARRIOR.

13:18.458 --> 13:20.291
- OR YOUR INNER IDIOT.

13:20.291 --> 13:23.208
- HEY, IF YOU CAN'T MUSTER UP
THE APPROPRIATE RESPECT,

13:23.208 --> 13:24.291
I'M DROPPING THE CURTAIN.

13:24.291 --> 13:26.333
- WHEN DID YOU GET THIS?

13:26.333 --> 13:27.583
- [sighs]

13:27.583 --> 13:30.125
I'VE BEEN ADDING
TO IT OVER TIME,

13:30.125 --> 13:32.750
BUT THE MAIN WORK STARTED
ABOUT TWO YEARS AGO.

13:32.750 --> 13:34.500
I WAS HAVING A BIT
OF A CRISIS

13:34.500 --> 13:36.792
AND THIS WAS MY WAY
OF WORKING THROUGH IT.

13:36.792 --> 13:37.834
- VIAGRA PROBABLY
WOULD HAVE BEEN CHEAPER.

13:37.834 --> 13:39.792
- THIS WAS A CRISIS OF THE SOUL,
MORGAN.

13:39.792 --> 13:42.000
- DON'T YOU HAVE TO HAVE A SOUL
BEFORE IT COULD BE IN CRISIS?

13:42.000 --> 13:44.458
- POINT IS YOU KNOW
A LITTLE ABOUT THIS WORLD.

13:44.458 --> 13:45.375
- I KNOW A LITTLE.

13:45.375 --> 13:46.625
THE PERSON YOU WANT
TO TALK TO

13:46.625 --> 13:49.208
IS MY BODY ARTIST
MICHAEL ANGELO.

13:49.208 --> 13:50.625
- YOU'RE KIDDING?
MICHELANGELO?

13:50.625 --> 13:52.333
- TWO WORDS.
MICHAEL ANGELO.

13:52.333 --> 13:53.458
AND, YES, I'M SERIOUS.

13:53.458 --> 13:55.959
IF YOUR TATTOO WERE DONE
BY ANYONE LOCAL,

13:55.959 --> 13:57.750
MICHAEL ANGELO WILL KNOW.

13:57.750 --> 13:59.792
- YOU CAN LOWER THE CURTAIN.

14:06.375 --> 14:08.709
- FROM THE OUTSIDE,
A NORMAL HOME

14:08.709 --> 14:10.583
IS INDISTINGUISHABLE
FROM THE HOME

14:10.583 --> 14:13.542
OF A MONSTER WHO PUTS WOMEN
IN BARRELS.

14:18.458 --> 14:23.792
BUT STEP INSIDE--

14:23.792 --> 14:25.583
THERE MUST BE SOMETHING
AROUND HERE

14:25.583 --> 14:30.458
THAT WILL POINT ME
TO BOYD'S ACCOMPLICES.

14:30.458 --> 14:31.417
[sighs]

14:31.417 --> 14:36.250
SOMEBODY'S BEEN HERE.

14:36.250 --> 14:37.291
OH, GREAT.

14:37.291 --> 14:40.000
BLOOD.

14:50.709 --> 14:53.709
THEY WERE GOING THROUGH
BOYD'S FILES.

15:03.792 --> 15:07.417
WHOEVER BOYD WAS WORKING
WITH MUST HAVE PANICKED.

15:07.417 --> 15:11.667
TRIED TO COVER UP ANY TRACE
OF THEIR EXISTENCE.

15:11.667 --> 15:14.709
AMATEURS.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.083

15:22.542 --> 15:24.750
- HERE HE IS, FRESHLY BATHED,

15:24.750 --> 15:27.667
CLEAN AS A WHISTLE,
AND READY FOR BED.

15:27.667 --> 15:29.792
- THANKS.
- I'M GONNA GET GOING.

15:29.792 --> 15:33.083
- CHECK'S ON THE COUNTER.

15:33.083 --> 15:34.583
SONYA, CAN I ASK YOU
A QUESTION?

15:34.583 --> 15:37.208
- SURE.

15:37.208 --> 15:41.333
- HAVE YOU EVER NOTICED
HARRISON BEING...AGGRESSIVE?

15:41.333 --> 15:42.959
- AGGRESSIVE?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

15:42.959 --> 15:45.333
- UH, SCRATCHING.
STUFF LIKE THAT.

15:45.333 --> 15:47.750
- NO.

15:47.750 --> 15:48.917
HE'S A VERY GENTLE CHILD,
REALLY.

15:48.917 --> 15:50.583
WHY?

15:50.583 --> 15:51.959
- THERE MIGHT HAVE BEEN
AN INCIDENT

15:51.959 --> 15:53.333
AT ONE OF THE MOMMY
AND ME CLASSES.

15:53.333 --> 15:55.291
CAN'T BE SURE
IT WAS HARRISON OR NOT.

15:55.291 --> 15:56.583
- HE'S A LITTLE BOY.

15:56.583 --> 15:57.917
MY LITTLE BROTHER USED
TO BITE PEOPLE.

15:57.917 --> 16:00.041
BLOODY LITTLE CANNIBAL.

16:00.041 --> 16:02.417
NOW HE'S A VEGETARIAN.
WORKS FOR GREENPEACE.

16:02.417 --> 16:03.458
- WELL, THAT'S COMFORTING.

16:03.458 --> 16:05.291
- [chuckles]

16:05.291 --> 16:06.834
NOT TO WORRY.

16:06.834 --> 16:08.750
YOU'VE GOT A LITTLE ANGEL
ON YOUR HANDS.

16:08.750 --> 16:10.041
NOTHING CAN CHANGE THAT.

16:10.041 --> 16:11.959
SEE YOU TOMORROW MORNING.

16:11.959 --> 16:16.333
- NIGHT.

16:16.333 --> 16:18.959
[sighs]

16:18.959 --> 16:22.959
NO MATCH FOR DADDY
IN THE CRIMINAL DATABASE.

16:22.959 --> 16:26.083
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.
MAYBE HE DRIVES.

16:26.083 --> 16:27.709
LET'S CHECK THE DMV.

16:44.083 --> 16:47.125
SHE BEAT ME TO IT.

17:32.500 --> 17:35.333
OH, MY GOD.

17:43.834 --> 17:45.750
- DEXTER.

17:45.750 --> 17:48.750
THIS SEEM LIKE THE PRODUCT
OF A STABLE MIND?

17:52.333 --> 17:57.375
- A CLOSET WAS THE ONLY PLACE
SHE FELT SAFE FROM THEM.

17:57.375 --> 17:59.125
SHE'S REMADE IT HERE.

17:59.125 --> 18:01.709
- DEXTER, ARE YOU LISTENING
TO ME?

18:01.709 --> 18:04.834
- YES, I'M LISTENING.

18:04.834 --> 18:06.250
- SHE'S NOT A KILLER.
SHE'S NOT YOU.

18:06.250 --> 18:09.250
SHE'S COMING UNDONE.

18:12.667 --> 18:14.291
WHAT'S THAT NOW?

18:14.291 --> 18:17.917
- THIS IS THE LETTER SHE TOOK
FROM BOYD FOWLER'S HOUSE.

18:17.917 --> 18:21.709
FROM HIS EX-CELLMATE
ROBERT BRUNNER.

18:21.709 --> 18:23.208
"GETTING PAROLED NEXT WEEK.

18:23.208 --> 18:24.917

18:24.917 --> 18:27.125
S-L-E-A-P.

18:27.125 --> 18:29.834
- SHE'S FOUND A TARGET.

18:29.834 --> 18:31.917
- YOU DON'T KNOW
WHAT SHE'S PLANNING.

18:31.917 --> 18:34.458
- I KNOW THIS ISN'T GONNA
END WELL.

18:34.458 --> 18:37.083
SHE KEEPS GOING THIS WAY,
SHE'S GONNA GET HERSELF KILLED

18:37.083 --> 18:40.000
OR THROWN IN JAIL AND YOU'RE
GONNA BE RIGHT THERE WITH HER.

18:40.000 --> 18:42.625
DEX, SHE'S GONNA
BRING YOU DOWN.

19:00.959 --> 19:03.417
- I KNOW WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

19:03.417 --> 19:06.291
- HAVING BREAKFAST?

19:06.291 --> 19:08.041
- YOU'RE LOOKING
FOR THE MEN WHO HURT YOU.

19:08.041 --> 19:11.834
- SO, WHAT,
YOU'RE SPYING ON ME NOW?

19:11.834 --> 19:15.959
- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO IF YOU
ACTUALLY FIND ONE OF THESE GUYS?

19:15.959 --> 19:17.333
- MAYBE...

19:17.333 --> 19:19.208
WHAT YOU WON'T.

19:19.208 --> 19:20.667
- ARE YOU GONNA KILL THEM?
IS THAT IT?

19:20.667 --> 19:23.166
- I'M SORRY.

19:23.166 --> 19:27.250
YOU DON'T GET
TO TELL ME WHAT TO DO.

19:27.250 --> 19:29.875
I ASKED FOR YOUR HELP.
YOU TURNED ME DOWN.

19:29.875 --> 19:32.667
- FOR YOUR OWN GOOD.

19:32.667 --> 19:36.583
- LOOK...

19:36.583 --> 19:39.333
YOU SAVED MY LIFE.
I'M GRATEFUL FOR THAT.

19:39.333 --> 19:41.959
BUT WHAT I NEED FROM YOU RIGHT
NOW IS TO LEAVE ME ALONE.

19:41.959 --> 19:42.917
- LUMEN--

19:42.917 --> 19:45.542
- DON'T TOUCH ME!

19:50.041 --> 19:52.125
- [sighs]

20:00.667 --> 20:03.125
THESE MEN PUT FIVE WOMEN
IN BARRELS.

THEY'RE NOT GONNA WANT
TO BE FOUND.

20:04.667 --> 20:07.959
PLEASE...

20:07.959 --> 20:11.542
STOP THIS BEFORE
IT'S TOO LATE.

20:20.166 --> 20:23.875

20:23.875 --> 20:27.333
SHE'S NOT GOING TO STOP
UNTIL SHE FINDS BRUNNER.

20:41.083 --> 20:42.542
THE LAST TWO DAYS
ABOUT QUINN.

20:42.542 --> 20:43.709
- WHAT ABOUT QUINN?

20:43.709 --> 20:46.542
- THE VACATION
HE'S BEING FORCED TO TAKE.

20:46.542 --> 20:48.583
SHE'S FEELING SHORT-HANDED
WITHOUT HER PARTNER,

20:48.583 --> 20:50.375
AND TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH,
WE NEED HIM.

20:50.375 --> 20:52.917
- WELL, IT'S THE UNION.

20:52.917 --> 20:55.041
NOT MY CALL.

20:55.041 --> 20:58.542
THAT ALL?

20:58.542 --> 21:00.041

I NEED TO KNOW

21:00.041 --> 21:01.166
ABOUT MY CASE WITH I.A.?

21:01.166 --> 21:04.834

I NEED TO KNOW

21:07.458 --> 21:13.250

22:08.834 --> 22:10.709
HOPE YOU DIDN'T HAVE
TO DIG TOO DEEP.

22:10.709 --> 22:12.959

24:11.667 --> 24:12.709
- [giggles]

24:12.709 --> 24:16.083
- OKAY.

24:16.083 --> 24:17.709
WE INTERVIEWED THIS KID WHO SAW
THIS ON THE HAND

24:17.709 --> 24:19.750
OF A SUSPECT WE'RE
LOOKING FOR.

24:19.750 --> 24:21.125
ANY IDEA WHAT IT MEANS?

24:21.125 --> 24:24.458
- CRUDE, SIMPLISTIC, BUT...

24:24.458 --> 24:26.041
IT'S DEFINITELY AN EYE.

24:26.041 --> 24:29.083
LOOK.

24:29.083 --> 24:30.333
THE SIMILARITY.

24:30.333 --> 24:32.417
SEE?

24:32.417 --> 24:34.583
- AND THAT WOULD MEAN?

24:34.583 --> 24:37.208
- EYES SYMBOLIZE
THE THIRD EYE IN OUR MINDS,

24:37.208 --> 24:38.875
LIKE THE GOD HORUS

24:38.875 --> 24:41.709
AND ALSO...

24:41.709 --> 24:44.166
JUST LIKE...

24:44.166 --> 24:47.250
THE BACK OF A DOLLAR BILL.

24:50.041 --> 24:51.375
- HMM.

24:51.375 --> 24:52.959
HAVE YOU EVER DONE SOMETHING
LIKE THIS?

24:52.959 --> 24:54.709
- WELL, IF I HAD,
I WOULD HAVE REMEMBERED IT.

24:54.709 --> 24:56.834
- ANYTHING ELSE
YOU CAN TELL US?

24:56.834 --> 24:58.291
WE'RE KIND
OF DESPERATE HERE.

24:58.291 --> 24:59.125
- WITHOUT IT IN FRONT OF ME,

24:59.125 --> 25:02.000
THAT'S THE BEST I CAN DO.

25:02.000 --> 25:04.250
I'M SORRY.
- NO, IT'S OKAY.

25:04.250 --> 25:07.083
- [sighs]
M, THANK YOU SO MUCH ANYWAYS.

25:07.083 --> 25:09.000
- ALWAYS FOR YOU.

25:09.000 --> 25:12.291
AND YOU...

25:12.291 --> 25:14.625
YOU COME SEE ME ANYTIME, OKAY?

25:14.625 --> 25:17.458
- OKAY, THANK YOU.

25:17.458 --> 25:18.959
- OKAY.
- OKAY, BYE.

25:18.959 --> 25:20.500
- BYE.

25:20.500 --> 25:21.667
- I'LL BE IN SOON.

25:21.667 --> 25:23.375
- BYE.

25:23.375 --> 25:24.542
- HEY, I THINK SHE LIKES YOU.

25:24.542 --> 25:28.083
- DON'T EVER SPEAK
ABOUT THIS.

25:28.083 --> 25:30.542
- SINCE WE'RE ALREADY HERE,

25:30.542 --> 25:31.709
WHY DON'T YOU GET QUINN'S
NAME PUT ON YOUR--

25:31.709 --> 25:33.166
- HEY, I HAVE A GUN.

25:33.166 --> 25:34.291
- I'LL JUST WAIT IN THE CAR.

25:34.291 --> 25:36.250
- OKAY.

25:36.250 --> 25:40.542
[keypad tones]

25:40.542 --> 25:42.083
[cell phone trilling]

25:42.083 --> 25:43.250
- HELLO?

25:43.250 --> 25:45.625
- CIRA, IT'S ME.
- ANY LUCK?

25:45.625 --> 25:47.792
- JUST A STEAMING PILE
OF FUCK ALL.

25:47.792 --> 25:49.166
PLEASE TELL ME YOU HAVE
SOMETHING.

25:49.166 --> 25:51.291
- I'VE GONE THROUGH MOST
OF THE BANK'S ATM FOOTAGE.

25:51.291 --> 25:52.458
EIGHT NAMES AND COUNTING.

25:52.458 --> 25:53.792
THEY'RE ALL FREAKING OUT
ABOUT SOMETHING

25:53.792 --> 25:55.500
WHILE THEY'RE WITHDRAWING
MAXIMUM AMOUNTS

25:55.500 --> 25:56.792
FROM THEIR ACCOUNTS JUST LIKE
OUR FIRST

25:56.792 --> 25:57.875
SANTA MUERTE VICS.

25:57.875 --> 26:00.291
- I WANT ADDRESSES
FOR ALL EIGHT NAMES

26:00.291 --> 26:01.709
AND ANY OTHERS YOU CAN FIND.

26:01.709 --> 26:03.458
I'LL PICK YOU UP ON MY
WAY TO WORK TOMORROW

26:03.458 --> 26:05.875
AND WE'LL CHECK
'EM OUT, OKAY?

26:13.375 --> 26:16.250
- POOR JULIA TUTTLE.

26:16.250 --> 26:17.625
THE MOTHER OF MIAMI.

26:17.625 --> 26:21.291
THEY NAMED THIS BRIDGE
AFTER HER IN HER HONOR.

26:21.291 --> 26:26.375
NOW IT'S CRAWLING WITH
PEDOPHILES AND SEX OFFENDERS.

26:27.917 --> 26:31.208
SO MUCH FOR HONOR.

26:48.959 --> 26:51.500
- JAPAN'S TOTAL AREA
IS SLIGHTLY SMALLER

26:51.500 --> 26:53.417
THAN THE U.S. STATE
OF MONTANA.

26:53.417 --> 26:57.208
- YOU MIND IF I WATCH?

26:57.208 --> 26:59.250
- THE KID FUCKERS STAY OVER
BY THE TRACKS.

26:59.250 --> 27:01.083
- THAT'S NOT WHY I'M HERE.

27:01.083 --> 27:02.375
- AND WHY IS THAT?

27:02.375 --> 27:04.583
- STUCK-UP LITTLE CO-ED
AND I

27:04.583 --> 27:06.500
HAD A LEGAL DISAGREEMENT
CONCERNING

27:06.500 --> 27:11.208
THE MEANING
OF THE WORD "CONSENT."

27:11.208 --> 27:15.083
- TAKE A LOAD OFF.

27:15.083 --> 27:18.375
- APPRECIATE IT, BROTHER.

27:18.375 --> 27:20.625
[sighs]

27:20.625 --> 27:22.125
- WHERE'D YOU DO YOUR TIME?

27:22.125 --> 27:24.333
- OKEECHOBEE.

27:24.333 --> 27:26.000
- [scoffs]

27:26.000 --> 27:28.667
MY LAST STRETCH WAS
IN THAT SHITHOLE.

27:28.667 --> 27:30.375
ROUGH PLACE.

27:30.375 --> 27:32.834
- YEAH.

27:32.834 --> 27:35.166
TOLD EVERYONE I WAS IN
FOR ARMED ROBBERY

27:35.166 --> 27:39.000
TO KEEP A TARGET
OFF MY BACK.

27:39.000 --> 27:40.500
YOU FROM MIAMI?

27:40.500 --> 27:41.583
- USED TO BE.

27:41.583 --> 27:43.834
GUY I BUNKED WITH
LIVES DOWN HERE NOW.

27:43.834 --> 27:46.500
THOUGHT I'D LET HIM SHOW ME
THE TOWN AND HAVE SOME FUN.

27:46.500 --> 27:48.125
- DID THAT FUN INCLUDE LUMEN?

27:48.125 --> 27:50.583
- THAT IS UNTIL
MY PAROLE OFFICER,

27:50.583 --> 27:52.000
THE CUNT,
STARTED GIVING ME SHIT

27:52.000 --> 27:55.250
ABOUT STAYING WITH SOMEONE
FROM THE JOINT.

27:55.250 --> 27:56.375
WOUND UP HERE.

27:56.375 --> 27:58.625
- MMM.
BEATS A CELL.

27:58.625 --> 28:00.500
- BARELY.

28:00.500 --> 28:05.125
ONCE MY PAROLE IS DONE,
FUCK FLORIDA.

28:05.125 --> 28:07.458
I'M GOING NORTH.

28:07.458 --> 28:10.917
GET ME SOME OF THAT
FARM-FRESH PUSSY.

28:10.917 --> 28:13.041
YOU EVER TAP THAT?

28:13.041 --> 28:16.000
- CAN'T SAY THAT I HAVE.

28:16.000 --> 28:18.583
- A COUPLE WEEKS AGO...

28:18.583 --> 28:23.125
I HAD THIS HOT LITTLE BLONDE
ON ALL FOURS.

28:23.125 --> 28:24.917
A FEW OF US DID.

28:24.917 --> 28:27.458
BELIEVE ME, THAT BITCH
GOT EVERY FUCKING INCH

28:27.458 --> 28:30.875
OF MY MOTHERFUCKING--
- THAT'S ENOUGH.

28:34.667 --> 28:37.208
- THIS ROOM WAS MEANT FOR BOYD,
NOT HIS CELLMATE.

28:37.208 --> 28:39.375
- THEY WERE CO-WORKERS,
PARTNERS.

28:39.375 --> 28:40.417
BASICALLY THE SAME.

28:40.417 --> 28:41.542
- YOU'RE SURE?

28:41.542 --> 28:44.917
- I NEED TO KILL HIM

28:44.917 --> 28:45.875
SO LUMEN DOESN'T HAVE TO.

28:45.875 --> 28:47.667
I DON'T WANT HER
DOWN THAT ROAD.

28:47.667 --> 28:49.000
- THINK ABOUT
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

28:49.000 --> 28:51.041
- I AM.

28:51.041 --> 28:52.583
- HE'S A SEX OFFENDER.
- I KNOW.

28:52.583 --> 28:55.333
- ON PAROLE.

28:55.333 --> 28:56.542
- WHAT ARE YOU SAYING?

28:56.542 --> 28:58.542
- THINK!

28:58.542 --> 29:01.667
ARE YOU LISTENING?

29:07.125 --> 29:08.667
OKAY.

29:08.667 --> 29:10.500
- HE'S WEARING AN ANKLE
BRACELET.

29:10.500 --> 29:11.709
IT COULDN'T HAVE BEEN HIM.

29:11.709 --> 29:16.542
SHE HAD THE WRONG GUY.

29:16.542 --> 29:18.709
I WAS READY TO KILL HIM.

29:22.417 --> 29:26.291
I WAS READY TO KILL HIM.

29:26.291 --> 29:28.667
I WAS READY TO KILL HIM!

29:28.667 --> 29:32.083
[train whistle blows]

29:32.083 --> 29:34.959
ROBERT BRUNNER ISN'T ONE
OF THE MEN WHO HURT HER.

29:39.333 --> 29:41.000
HARRY'S RIGHT.

29:41.000 --> 29:44.917
I HAVE TO CONVINCE LUMEN
TO DO WHAT I NEVER COULD.

29:44.917 --> 29:49.083
TO MOVE ON.

29:49.083 --> 29:51.500
- YOU'RE HOME EARLY.

29:51.500 --> 29:53.583
- WHERE'S SONYA?

29:53.583 --> 29:55.166
- I SENT HER HOME.

29:55.166 --> 29:57.166
SHE SAID YOU WERE GONNA
BE WORKING LATE.

29:57.166 --> 29:59.208
- HOPE YOU DON'T MIND,
I GRABBED A BEER.

29:59.208 --> 30:00.458
- WHAT'S HE DOING HERE?

30:00.458 --> 30:04.583
- HE WANTED TO...

30:04.583 --> 30:07.083
BORROW...

30:07.083 --> 30:08.333
A BOOK.

30:08.333 --> 30:10.917
- HE READS?

30:10.917 --> 30:11.959
- YEAH, HE DOES.

30:11.959 --> 30:14.291
- HERE.

30:14.291 --> 30:15.792
- THANKS.

30:15.792 --> 30:17.792
LITTLE VACATION READING.

30:17.792 --> 30:20.291
- QUINN WAS JUST LEAVING.

30:20.291 --> 30:24.750
- WHAT SHE SAID.

30:24.750 --> 30:28.542
- I WILL CALL YOU
IN THE MORNING, JOSEPH.

30:28.542 --> 30:33.834
- OH, OKAY, DEBRA.

30:33.834 --> 30:39.458
KIND OF WARM FOR GLOVES.

30:39.458 --> 30:40.834
- GOOD NIGHT.

30:40.834 --> 30:42.625
- THANKS FOR THE BOOK.

30:49.041 --> 30:52.166
- WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

30:52.166 --> 30:54.500
- IT'S LATE,
SO I'LL TAKE THE COUCH.

30:54.500 --> 30:58.166
- ARE YOU AND QUINN?

30:58.166 --> 31:00.208
- [sighs]

31:00.208 --> 31:04.333
WE'RE FUCK BUDDIES.
THAT'S IT.

31:04.333 --> 31:06.166
- YOU NEED QUINN FOR THAT?

31:06.166 --> 31:08.250
- I KNOW IT'S INSANE.

31:08.250 --> 31:10.291
I--I KNOW IT'S...

31:10.291 --> 31:12.458
WRONG FOR A FUCK-TON
OF REAS--

31:12.458 --> 31:14.500
WILL YOU PLEASE STOP LOOKING
AT ME LIKE THAT?

31:14.500 --> 31:16.834
- IT'S YOUR LIFE, DEB.

31:16.834 --> 31:20.000
JUST DON'T BRING HIM AROUND
WHEN HARRISON'S HERE.

31:20.000 --> 31:21.166
- WHAT'S THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

31:21.166 --> 31:22.792
- WELL, HE'S AT
AN IMPRESSIONABLE AGE.

31:22.792 --> 31:24.667
WE DON'T KNOW WHAT MIGHT
RUB OFF ON HIM.

31:24.667 --> 31:27.875
- WHAT WILL RUB OFF ON HIM?

31:27.875 --> 31:29.250
- JUST KEEP QUINN AWAY
FROM MY SON.

31:29.250 --> 31:30.208
- FINE.

31:30.208 --> 31:31.166
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE WRONG
ABOUT QUINN.

31:31.166 --> 31:33.583
HE'S...

31:33.583 --> 31:35.000
NOT THAT BAD.

31:35.000 --> 31:38.166
[channels changing]

31:38.166 --> 31:40.041
- HEY.

31:40.041 --> 31:43.583
SORRY.
LONG DAY.

31:43.583 --> 31:45.917
- DINNER'S IN THE OVEN.

31:45.917 --> 31:49.834
- YOU MIND IF I HOP
IN THE SHOWER FIRST?

31:55.208 --> 31:57.375
- YOU NEVER CALLED.

31:57.375 --> 31:58.709
- YEAH, I KNOW.

31:58.709 --> 32:01.250
I JUST LOST TRACK OF TIME.

32:01.250 --> 32:05.000
- WHY SO LATE?

32:05.000 --> 32:09.500
- BUDGETS ARE DUE AT
THE END OF THE MONTH, SO.

32:09.500 --> 32:10.834
I'M GONNA--

32:10.834 --> 32:12.208
- I'LL SET THE TABLE.

32:12.208 --> 32:14.041
- OKAY, THANKS.

32:18.250 --> 32:21.875
[shower water running]

32:51.500 --> 32:52.625
- SHE'S NOT THERE.

32:52.625 --> 32:54.834
YOU JUST MISSED HER.

32:54.834 --> 32:56.333
- DID MY WIFE SAY WHERE
SHE WAS GOING?

32:56.333 --> 32:57.792
- YOU TWO STILL NOT
SEEING EYE TO EYE?

32:57.792 --> 32:59.542
- LOOK, I REALLY NEED
TO FIND HER.

32:59.542 --> 33:00.667
IT'S IMPORTANT.

33:00.667 --> 33:02.959
- SHE WAS ASKING
ABOUT TUTTLE BRIDGE.

33:02.959 --> 33:07.083
I TOLD HER THAT IS THE LAST
PLACE SHE WANTS TO BE.

33:27.834 --> 33:30.583
- WHAT THE FUCK, ASSHOLE?

33:30.583 --> 33:31.709
NICE.

33:31.709 --> 33:33.125
WHERE YOU GOING, BABY?

34:48.166 --> 34:54.250
[breathing heavily]

35:00.750 --> 35:04.583
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

35:04.583 --> 35:07.083
- I'M TAKING YOU OUT OF HERE.

35:07.083 --> 35:08.417
- GIVE ME THE GUN.
- NO.

35:08.417 --> 35:10.250
- GIVE IT TO ME!

35:10.250 --> 35:13.000
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT THOSE
ANIMALS DID TO ME.

35:13.000 --> 35:14.417
PASSING ME AROUND.

35:14.417 --> 35:16.417
I COULDN'T MOVE.
I COULDN'T STOP THEM.

35:16.417 --> 35:17.834
- IT WASN'T BRUNNER.
- IT WAS.

35:17.834 --> 35:20.166
HE WAS BOYD'S CELLMATE.

35:20.166 --> 35:21.583
HE RAPED THREE WOMEN!

35:21.583 --> 35:23.208
HE TORTURED THEM JUST
LIKE HE DID TO ME.

35:23.208 --> 35:24.750
- THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
- YOU WEREN'T THERE!

35:24.750 --> 35:26.208
- JUST LISTEN TO ME.

35:26.208 --> 35:28.959
HE'S WEARING AN ANKLE BRACELET
AS PART OF HIS PAROLE.

35:28.959 --> 35:30.667
IF HE LEAVES THIS PLACE,
IT GETS REPORTED.

35:30.667 --> 35:31.959
I CHECKED.

35:31.959 --> 35:37.500
HE WAS HERE THE WHOLE TIME
YOU WERE TAKEN.

35:37.500 --> 35:39.333
ROBERT BRUNNER'S
NEVER SEEN YOU BEFORE.

35:39.333 --> 35:41.458
HE'S NEVER TOUCHED YOU.

35:41.458 --> 35:43.166
HE NEVER HURT YOU.

35:43.166 --> 35:46.125
YOU WERE ABOUT TO MURDER
THE WRONG MAN.

35:50.417 --> 35:53.792
- OH, FUCK.

35:53.792 --> 35:56.834
- YOU SEE?
THIS IS WHERE IT LEADS.

35:56.834 --> 35:58.041
BUT IT'S NOT TOO LATE.

35:58.041 --> 36:01.250
THERE'S STILL NO BLOOD
ON YOUR HANDS.

36:05.792 --> 36:09.166
- I JUST WANT TO FEEL BETTER.

36:09.166 --> 36:11.500
I WANT ALL THIS TO GO AWAY.

36:11.500 --> 36:13.000
[sobbing]

36:13.000 --> 36:14.709
- IT WILL.

36:14.709 --> 36:17.500
- I DON'T SEE HOW IT CAN.

36:17.500 --> 36:19.458
- GO HOME...

36:19.458 --> 36:22.083
BACK TO YOUR FAMILY.

36:22.083 --> 36:25.000
IF YOU DON'T
PUT THIS BEHIND YOU,

36:25.000 --> 36:29.125
I SWEAR WHAT YOU'RE FEELING NOW
WILL ONLY GET WORSE.

36:31.667 --> 36:36.417
- [sobbing]

36:36.417 --> 36:37.834
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

36:37.834 --> 36:39.625
I'LL GO.

36:39.625 --> 36:43.834
OKAY.

36:43.834 --> 36:46.166
- NEXT ONE ON OUR ATM LIST.

36:46.166 --> 36:47.333
- OH-FOR-FUCKING-FIVE.

36:47.333 --> 36:52.041
THAT'S HOW I LIKE
TO START MY FUCKING DAY.

36:52.041 --> 36:53.917
YOU WANT TO MAKE
A BET WHY THIS ONE

36:53.917 --> 36:56.041
WAS TAKING A WAD OF CASH
OUT OF THE ATM?

36:56.041 --> 36:58.375
GAMBLING? HOOKERS? DRUGS?

36:58.375 --> 36:59.375
- YOU'RE VERY CYNICAL.

36:59.375 --> 37:02.250

37:03.375 --> 37:04.750

POSITIVE ENERGY

37:04.750 --> 37:07.583

AND BODY TRANSPORT
AT 2075 OCEAN WAY

38:12.834 --> 38:14.542
FOR A POSSIBLE
DOUBLE HOMICIDE.

38:14.542 --> 38:17.750
AND YOU NEED TO TELL
MASUKA AND DEXTER

38:17.750 --> 38:20.208
THAT THEY NEED TO BRING
A BUG KIT...

38:20.208 --> 38:21.750
AND SOME FUCKING CRACKERS.

38:21.750 --> 38:24.792
[keypad tone]

38:24.792 --> 38:28.250
YOU GOOD?

39:04.750 --> 39:05.959

39:05.959 --> 39:07.125
- HEY, HEY, HEY!

39:07.125 --> 39:08.667
- HEY, SERGEANT,
YOU'RE MAKING A BIG MISTAKE!

39:08.667 --> 39:10.333
- THE ONLY MISTAKE I MADE
WAS NOT KICKING YOUR ASS

39:10.333 --> 39:11.834
WHEN YOU FIRST LAID EYES
ON MY WIFE.

39:11.834 --> 39:15.500
- ANGEL, LET HIM GO!
THIS IS A STING!

39:15.500 --> 39:19.792
LET HIM GO!

39:19.792 --> 39:21.333

39:21.333 --> 39:24.542
- NO SHIT, YOU IDIOT.

39:24.542 --> 39:26.166
WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED IF HE
BARGED IN HERE A HALF HOUR AGO?

39:26.166 --> 39:28.792
- I KNOW.

39:28.792 --> 39:31.291
JUST GIVE US A MINUTE, JIM.

39:31.291 --> 39:34.333
- YOU JUST DON'T LEARN,
DO YOU, BATISTA?

39:36.917 --> 39:40.083
- HAVE YOU COMPLETELY
LOST YOUR MIND?

39:40.083 --> 39:41.959
- I THOUGHT--
- WHAT?

39:41.959 --> 39:42.917
THAT I WAS FUCKING HIM?

39:42.917 --> 39:44.875
- WHAT AM I
SUPPOSED TO THINK?

39:44.875 --> 39:46.875
YOU BARELY TALK TO ME.

39:46.875 --> 39:49.083
THE LATE NIGHTS.
THE SNEAKING AROUND.

39:49.083 --> 39:52.667

39:52.667 --> 39:54.542
WAIT.
YOU--

39:54.542 --> 39:56.959
I DON'T EVEN WANT TO KNOW.

39:56.959 --> 40:00.625
I.A. NEEDED MY HELP
TO BUST A NARCOTICS COP

40:00.625 --> 40:02.417
ON THE TAKE AND I SAID YES.

40:02.417 --> 40:03.375
WHY?

40:03.375 --> 40:06.417
TO CLOSE THE BOOKS
ON YOUR BAR FIGHT!

40:06.417 --> 40:08.375
SO I DON'T WANT TO HEAR
ABOUT SNEAKING AROUND

40:08.375 --> 40:10.375
AND LATE NIGHTS!

40:10.375 --> 40:12.041
- WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME?

40:12.041 --> 40:13.917

40:49.208 --> 40:51.250

40:51.250 --> 40:53.917

FLIES--THE BLOW FLIES ARE
ATTRACTED BY THE SMELL

40:55.917 --> 40:57.333
AND THEY LAY EGGS
AND THE BEETLES,

40:57.333 --> 40:58.417
THEY'RE DRAWN
BY THE LARVAE,

40:58.417 --> 40:59.208
AND THEY BURROW
INTO EVERY ORIFICE--

40:59.208 --> 41:01.375
- I GET IT.
- WHAT DO WE KNOW?

41:01.375 --> 41:05.291

DANIEL TRYING

41:07.375 --> 41:09.417

41:09.417 --> 41:11.709
OFFICER MANZON AND I SHOW UP
TO INTERVIEW HIM

41:11.709 --> 41:13.125
AND WE FIND THE BODIES.

41:13.125 --> 41:15.458
- THE REMAINS HAVE ALREADY
STARTED TO MUMMIFY,

41:15.458 --> 41:17.333
BUT THE WOUNDS ARE CONSISTENT
WITH A MACHETE.

41:17.333 --> 41:19.000
I CAN MAKE SURE WHEN
I GET THEM BACK TO THE LAB.

41:19.000 --> 41:20.458
- WE LIKE THE FUENTES BROTHERS
FOR THIS.

41:20.458 --> 41:22.500
- ONLY WEIRD THING
IS WE CAN'T FIND

41:22.500 --> 41:25.125
ANY SANTA CLAUS MUERTE
MUMBO JUMBO BULLSHIT.

41:25.125 --> 41:27.125
- WE MIGHT BE LOOKING
AT THE FUENTES BROTHERS'

41:27.125 --> 41:28.583
FIRST VICTIMS.

41:28.583 --> 41:30.458
THE DEFENSIVE WOUNDS
AND HEAVY SMEARING

41:30.458 --> 41:32.166
SUGGEST OUR KILLERS
WERE STILL INEXPERIENCED.

41:32.166 --> 41:33.709
BEHEADING REQUIRES SKILL.

41:33.709 --> 41:36.208
- SO WE GOT THEIR GODDAMN
TRAINING WHEELS KILL?

41:36.208 --> 41:39.917
MEANS WE'RE BACK
TO FUCKING SQUARE ONE.

41:39.917 --> 41:41.125

41:41.125 --> 41:43.583
- OH, YEAH.

41:43.583 --> 41:45.583
THAT'S NEVER COMING OUT.
I LIKED THIS SHIRT TOO.

41:45.583 --> 41:47.667
I'LL GET A JACKET OUT
OF MY CAR.

41:47.667 --> 41:50.291
- ALL RIGHT.

42:09.125 --> 42:10.208
- IT WAS NEVER A TATTOO.

42:10.208 --> 42:13.917
IT WAS A STAMP
FROM A NIGHTCLUB.

42:13.917 --> 42:17.750
IT WAS A FUCKING NIGHTCLUB!

42:17.750 --> 42:19.917
IT'S A NIGHTCLUB!

42:19.917 --> 42:21.583

42:21.583 --> 42:23.750

42:23.750 --> 42:25.792
I'M GONNA GO DEAL

42:25.792 --> 42:27.083
NICE TO HAVE YOU BACK,
DEXTER.

42:27.083 --> 42:31.417
- GOOD TO BE BACK,
LIEUTENANT.

42:31.417 --> 42:35.750

43:13.083 --> 43:16.583
- I DON'T MIND.

43:16.583 --> 43:18.166
- I CAN PAY YOU BACK
FOR THE TICKET.

43:18.166 --> 43:19.709
I'LL SEND YOU SOME MONEY.

43:19.709 --> 43:22.417
EXCEPT...

43:22.417 --> 43:27.250
I STILL DON'T KNOW WHO
TO SEND IT TO.

43:27.250 --> 43:31.125
- DEXTER MORGAN.

43:31.125 --> 43:33.917
AND IT'S NOT NECESSARY.

43:33.917 --> 43:36.291
THE TICKET.

43:40.125 --> 43:43.458

FOR A FRESH START.

43:43.458 --> 43:45.208
SOMEWHERE WARM.

43:45.208 --> 43:46.250

THE RIGHT THING.

43:46.250 --> 43:48.291
YOUR PARENTS WILL BE...

43:48.291 --> 43:50.625
HAPPY TO SEE YOU.

43:50.625 --> 43:56.208

BUT I COULDN'T.

43:56.208 --> 44:00.250
WHAT WOULD I SAY?

44:00.250 --> 44:04.667
- JUST GIVE IT SOME TIME.

44:04.667 --> 44:09.792
- I CAN'T TELL THEM WHAT
HAPPENED TO ME.

44:09.792 --> 44:13.291
I CAN'T TELL ANYE.

44:13.291 --> 44:17.750
YOU'RE THE ONLY ONE WHO KNOWS.

44:21.291 --> 44:22.333
- YOU HAVE MY NUMBER.

44:22.333 --> 44:25.000
CALL ME IF YOU NEED
TO TALK ABOUT IT.

44:29.125 --> 44:30.834

45:22.458 --> 45:25.750
UNLESS YOU CONSENT

46:41.000 --> 46:42.709
- I HAD TO GAS UP THE CAR.

46:42.709 --> 46:44.250
MY FAULT O'MALLEY'S

46:44.250 --> 46:46.125

TO CELEBRATE JUST YET,

47:03.959 --> 47:06.291
BUT I HAVE A GOOD FEELING

48:51.875 --> 48:53.792
IS THERE DARKNESS
IN HARRISON

48:53.792 --> 48:59.250
OR IS IT JUST MY OWN FEAR
BEING REFLECTED BACK?

48:59.250 --> 49:03.208
- I JUST KNOW HE'S THE ONE
WHO SCRATCHED TEDDY.

49:03.208 --> 49:04.542
HE WAS RIGHT NEXT TO HIM.
