00:21.955 --> 00:23.557
Well, thanks
for the ride then, man.

00:23.657 --> 00:25.293
Mm-hmm.
Let's go, babe.

00:25.393 --> 00:26.527
Wait, wait, wait!
Let's just stay

00:26.627 --> 00:27.961
until they get to the chorus.

00:28.062 --> 00:29.297
Please?
Mmm...

00:29.397 --> 00:31.399
Sam won't mind. Right, Sam?

00:31.499 --> 00:33.201
Yeah, it's fine.

00:33.301 --> 00:34.602
See?

00:34.702 --> 00:36.370
He's the best. Fine.

00:36.470 --> 00:39.340
Then I'm drinking.
Oh, actually,

00:39.440 --> 00:41.209
you can't open that...
Oh!

00:41.309 --> 00:43.311
My bad.
Tyler!

00:43.411 --> 00:45.713
I'm sorry. I think
I have a napkin.

00:45.813 --> 00:46.714
Mm.

00:46.814 --> 00:48.216
It's fine. Really, it's okay.

00:48.316 --> 00:49.817
Just leave it.

00:49.917 --> 00:52.853
Oh. Hey, five stars,
man, seriously.

00:52.953 --> 00:55.055
Hey, be safe.

Come on.

01:11.139 --> 01:12.440
Oh, hey, buddy. Sorry.

01:12.540 --> 01:13.774
No, you got
to go through the app

01:13.874 --> 01:15.343
if you want a ride. Please.

01:15.443 --> 01:16.910
I'm desperate.

01:17.010 --> 01:18.346
It's too cold to walk.

01:18.446 --> 01:20.514
Where are you headed?

01:20.614 --> 01:22.516
Just a few blocks from here.

01:22.616 --> 01:24.218
I'll make it worth your while.

01:24.318 --> 01:27.255
It's okay, man.
You really don't have to...
No, no, no.

01:27.355 --> 01:28.656
Please, I insist.

01:28.756 --> 01:30.691
You're a lifesaver.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.262
Good man.

01:34.362 --> 01:35.696
You got an address?

01:35.796 --> 01:39.467
Uh, corner of Manchester
and 17th is fine.

01:39.567 --> 01:40.801
Okay.

01:41.969 --> 01:43.171
How's the temperature?

01:43.271 --> 01:45.306
You want some, uh,
music on or something?

01:45.406 --> 01:47.808
Whatever you like.

02:20.608 --> 02:22.676
They just bake cakes?

02:22.776 --> 02:25.346
And bread. The judges are
ruthless during bread week.

02:25.446 --> 02:26.747
But no one wins any money?

02:26.847 --> 02:28.382
Yeah. There's no backstabbing?

02:28.482 --> 02:30.418
What kind
of reality show is this?

02:30.518 --> 02:31.752
Well, watching people
do what they love

02:31.852 --> 02:33.621
without a monetary
incentive is delightful.

02:33.721 --> 02:35.589
Plus, they all have
really cute British accents.

02:35.689 --> 02:37.258
Yeah, I don't get it.

02:37.358 --> 02:38.592
Well, Parker will

02:38.692 --> 02:40.728
back me up on this,
wherever he is.

02:40.828 --> 02:42.396
What's with the flowers?

02:42.496 --> 02:44.465
It's not his birthday, is it?

02:44.565 --> 02:45.699
Maybe?

02:45.799 --> 02:47.067
How could we not know this?

02:47.167 --> 02:48.402
Well, I don't know.
I don't have Facebook, man.

02:48.502 --> 02:49.837
I don't know
anybody's birthday.

02:49.937 --> 02:51.104
Wait a second. You know
when my birthday is, right?

02:51.205 --> 02:52.540
Yeah, of course
I know when it is.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.208
Okay, guys, focus. Do...?

02:54.308 --> 02:56.944
I might have a card
in here or something.
Yeah, yeah.

02:57.044 --> 02:58.712
Oh, yeah. You know what?
I got a gift card

02:58.812 --> 03:00.047
to the coffee cart downstairs.

03:00.147 --> 03:01.615
It's got a little money
left on it.

03:01.715 --> 03:03.551
Okay, you guys don't think
he's gonna notice

03:03.651 --> 03:05.419
that you're giving him
a used gift card?

03:05.519 --> 03:06.887
This is Alden Parker,

03:06.987 --> 03:10.057
calling again about my father,
Roman Parker.

03:10.157 --> 03:12.460
I'd appreciate
a call back this time.

03:15.763 --> 03:17.331
What's everybody
standing around for?

03:17.431 --> 03:19.333
Happy birthday!

03:19.433 --> 03:21.001
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday.

03:21.101 --> 03:23.704
Hey!
My birthday's in November.

03:23.804 --> 03:24.872
Uh, happy belated...
I knew that.

03:24.972 --> 03:26.274
...belated birthday!

03:26.374 --> 03:27.308
Belated birthday.
Yay!

03:27.408 --> 03:28.876
Ow!

03:28.976 --> 03:32.380
Whoa. Uh, your father.
Did something happen, or...?

03:32.480 --> 03:34.014
Yes, something happened.

03:34.114 --> 03:36.417
My dad got kicked out of
his retirement home last week,

03:36.517 --> 03:39.453
and so, he's been living with me
until we find him a new place.

03:39.553 --> 03:42.222
Oh. Well, that's so sweet.
I'd love to spend that much time

03:42.323 --> 03:45.125
with my dad,
except he's 11 time zones away.

03:45.225 --> 03:46.494
You want mine?

03:46.594 --> 03:48.128
And I had to bring
my orchids here

03:48.228 --> 03:50.063
because he's constantly
turning up the thermostat.

03:50.163 --> 03:51.999
Why did he get kicked out
of the home?

03:52.099 --> 03:54.568
Apparently,
he was flirting... a lot.

03:54.668 --> 03:56.236
And the female residents

03:56.337 --> 03:57.905
were all fighting over him,

03:58.005 --> 04:00.408
and the administrator was tired
of dealing with the drama.

04:00.508 --> 04:01.842
That's my guy.

04:01.942 --> 04:03.377
I could see
that happening.

04:03.477 --> 04:04.978
He has a great
head of hair.

04:06.647 --> 04:09.650
Fatal car crash,
Rock Creek Park. Let's roll.

04:14.121 --> 04:17.625
Our victim is Petty Officer
First Class Sam Vega.

04:17.725 --> 04:19.192
He was a Seabee.

04:19.293 --> 04:21.094
Just returned from deployment
in Morocco last week.

04:21.194 --> 04:23.531
What were the Seabees doing
in Morocco?

04:23.631 --> 04:25.899
Humanitarian
civic action project.

04:25.999 --> 04:27.435
I think our petty officer
had a side job.

04:27.535 --> 04:30.471
Jetter's
that ride-share startup.

04:30.571 --> 04:31.605
Looks like
he was a driver.

04:31.705 --> 04:32.906
Good thing he didn't have

04:33.006 --> 04:34.742
any passengers with him
when he crashed.

04:34.842 --> 04:36.544
Time of death?

04:36.644 --> 04:38.879
Let's see. Uh, 1:00 a.m.

04:38.979 --> 04:41.014
Pretty foggy last night.
Visibility was low.

04:41.114 --> 04:43.216
McGEE: No skid marks
on the road. Doesn't look like

04:43.317 --> 04:45.819
he tried to slow down.
Could be a suicide.

04:46.554 --> 04:48.021
I don't think so.

04:48.121 --> 04:50.391
This bruising pattern is not
consistent with a car crash.

04:50.491 --> 04:51.692
It's, uh, more like a...

04:51.792 --> 04:53.193
Chokehold?
Yeah, and notably,

04:53.293 --> 04:57.130
he doesn't have
any defensive wounds.

04:57.230 --> 04:59.733
And this might be why.

04:59.833 --> 05:01.602
McGEE:
What is that? Some kind

05:01.702 --> 05:03.236
of injection-site reaction?

05:03.337 --> 05:06.840
Yeah, good eye. I'm guessing
it's from some sort of sedative.

05:06.940 --> 05:08.376
All right, so what
are we thinking?

05:08.476 --> 05:11.311
A passenger attacked Vega,
then dosed him,

05:11.412 --> 05:13.113
which caused him
to lose control of the car,

05:13.213 --> 05:14.448
crash into the tree.

05:14.548 --> 05:15.883
Well, if Vega wasn't alone,

05:15.983 --> 05:17.618
why aren't we looking
at two fatalities?

05:17.718 --> 05:19.887
This could be why.

05:19.987 --> 05:22.556
It was used to, uh,
weigh down on the gas pedal.

05:22.656 --> 05:23.991
Somebody wanted him to crash.

05:24.091 --> 05:26.159
Which would make this murder.

05:26.259 --> 05:28.295
You know, I've had
some bad ride-shares,

05:28.396 --> 05:29.830
but I just give 'em four stars.

05:29.930 --> 05:31.732
Not five stars?
That's harsh.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.401
Not as harsh as this.

05:33.501 --> 05:36.136
And I've got something here. Huh.

05:36.236 --> 05:38.472
Looks like some sort
of medicine vial.

05:38.572 --> 05:40.073
Any idea what that is?

05:40.173 --> 05:42.710
No idea. Hopefully,
Kasie can provide some answers.

05:42.810 --> 05:45.278
McGee, look into
his Jetter passengers.

05:45.379 --> 05:46.914
Knight, Torres,
head for Vega's house.

05:47.014 --> 05:49.583
See if you can find
any reason why someone would

05:49.683 --> 05:51.919
want this guy dead.

05:52.786 --> 05:54.922
<i>Sam's not in any trouble, is he?</i>

05:55.022 --> 05:57.525
Do you have any reason
to believe that he would be?

05:57.625 --> 05:59.560
Sam? Goodness, no.

05:59.660 --> 06:01.629
He's a landlord's dream.

06:01.729 --> 06:04.064
Quiet, courteous, tidy.

06:04.164 --> 06:06.199
Oh, here we are.

06:11.639 --> 06:13.874
Ugh.

06:14.875 --> 06:16.677
Doesn't seem that tidy to me.

06:16.777 --> 06:19.913
You think Sam did this?

06:25.586 --> 06:29.256
No... but I think
he made someone very mad.

06:37.330 --> 06:39.266
According to Vega's Jetter log,

06:39.366 --> 06:41.268
he dropped off
his last passengers

06:41.368 --> 06:42.903
an hour before he was killed.

06:43.003 --> 06:44.438
They rated him five stars.

06:44.538 --> 06:46.674
That's nothing.
The rider I just spoke to said

06:46.774 --> 06:48.709
he invited Vega to his wedding

06:48.809 --> 06:50.544
after getting a ride
to Baltimore.

06:50.644 --> 06:51.945
That's like a one-hour drive.

06:52.045 --> 06:53.947
Could be three
if the Orioles are at home.

06:54.047 --> 06:57.250
Wow. Guess Sam must've been
one hell of a conversationalist.

06:57.350 --> 06:58.919
All his passengers loved him.

06:59.019 --> 07:00.888
Yeah, but someone didn't.

07:00.988 --> 07:03.023
We found that
in Vega's apartment.

07:03.123 --> 07:04.191
That's blood.

07:04.291 --> 07:05.292
Vega's?

07:05.392 --> 07:06.760
Not according to Kasie.

07:06.860 --> 07:08.529
And whoever it is isn't
in the system, either.

07:08.629 --> 07:11.098
Okay, so, who did he piss off?

07:11.198 --> 07:13.133
Well, there's no sign of
forced entry, so we're thinking

07:13.233 --> 07:16.670
whoever did this knew Sam
and had access to his apartment.

07:16.770 --> 07:18.405
All right.
Think I got a contender here.

07:18.506 --> 07:21.074
Kasie found this
on Vega's cell phone.

07:21.174 --> 07:22.309
He got a bunch of

07:22.409 --> 07:24.111
angry texts and missed calls

07:24.211 --> 07:26.880
right before he was killed
from a Lisa Swenson.

07:26.980 --> 07:28.315
"You bastard!"

07:28.415 --> 07:30.584
"Screw you, dude.
You're going to regret this."

07:30.684 --> 07:32.720
Well, it's not exactly
a love letter, is it?

07:32.820 --> 07:36.323
No. I also found this picture
of her and Vega

07:36.423 --> 07:38.358
on her social media.

07:38.458 --> 07:40.728
So many pigeons.

07:40.828 --> 07:42.129
Sky rats.

07:42.229 --> 07:44.732
Pigeons?
Those are mourning doves.

07:44.832 --> 07:46.767
That's the state
bird of Wisconsin.

07:46.867 --> 07:49.269
File that away
for your next trivia night.

07:49.369 --> 07:52.439
Will do.
And my apologies to the dove.

07:52.540 --> 07:54.808
"Happy six months! #lovebirds."

07:54.908 --> 07:57.110
Seems like
there was trouble in paradise.

07:57.210 --> 07:59.847
Oh, do we really think
she could have choked out Vega?

07:59.947 --> 08:02.449
Or she could hire somebody
to do the job for her.

08:02.550 --> 08:05.452
Let's find out. Bring her in.

08:10.257 --> 08:11.291
Hey, Jimmy.

08:11.391 --> 08:12.626
Oh, hey.

08:12.726 --> 08:14.194
Just familiarizing myself

08:14.294 --> 08:15.896
with showy lady's
slippers, aka

08:15.996 --> 08:18.398
cypripedium reginae.

08:18.498 --> 08:20.233
It's Parker's orchid. Ah.

08:20.333 --> 08:22.469
Does he want you to perform
an autopsy on it or something?

08:22.570 --> 08:24.304
Oh, no, no, no, it's not dead.

08:24.404 --> 08:26.439
The poor little guy's
on his last legs.

08:26.540 --> 08:28.108
Parker said something
about the humidity levels

08:28.208 --> 08:29.442
in here being its only hope.

08:29.543 --> 08:31.178
And the music?
Well, he said

08:31.278 --> 08:35.515
that words of affirmation and
soothing songs help plants grow.

08:35.616 --> 08:38.619
Hmm.
Honestly, I'm afraid
to breathe on the thing.

08:38.719 --> 08:41.421
I wouldn't. Parker's going
through so much with his dad.

08:41.521 --> 08:43.090
That thing dying might be
the final straw.

08:43.190 --> 08:46.526
Okay, in that case, why don't
you and I slowly back away

08:46.627 --> 08:48.328
from the lady slipper?

08:48.428 --> 08:51.064
Um, so what do we know
about Petty Officer Vega?

08:51.164 --> 08:53.834
Right. Cause of death was
a total spinal cord injury

08:53.934 --> 08:56.036
at the C1 vertebrae,
but, more importantly,

08:56.136 --> 08:59.439
Kasie was able to identify
the sedative that was used

08:59.539 --> 09:00.974
to knock Vega out.

09:01.074 --> 09:02.710
It was propofol.

09:02.810 --> 09:04.812
Well, that's not something
you just pick up at a pharmacy.

09:04.912 --> 09:07.314
Correct. But hospitals
are filled with it.

09:07.414 --> 09:09.149
We're hoping to use the
partial batch number on the vial

09:09.249 --> 09:11.685
you found at the crime scene to
figure out where it came from.

09:11.785 --> 09:13.320
Great. Keep me posted.

09:13.420 --> 09:14.922
One more thing.

09:15.022 --> 09:16.356
I also found trace amounts

09:16.456 --> 09:17.925
of walnut oil, linen

09:18.025 --> 09:21.662
and what I believe is
calcium fluoride on his hands.

09:22.896 --> 09:25.365
Okay, I give up.
What does that mean?

09:25.465 --> 09:31.271
That Vega was into really fine
dining and... dental hygiene?

09:31.371 --> 09:33.874
Okay. You are cute,

09:33.974 --> 09:36.143
but I'm gonna say
"no" on that one.

09:36.243 --> 09:37.645
Kasie's still running
some tests.

09:37.745 --> 09:39.012
You might want
to talk to her.

09:39.112 --> 09:40.881
Won't be as cute,
probably be more helpful.

09:40.981 --> 09:42.650
And I'll contact my friend
at the FDA,

09:42.750 --> 09:44.351
see if we can fast-track
our request

09:44.451 --> 09:45.686
for the source of the propofol.

09:45.786 --> 09:48.055
Okay, I will let Parker know.

09:51.992 --> 09:55.663
Has anyone told you
how beautiful you look today?

09:59.099 --> 10:01.101
So Sam stands me up,
ignores my calls,

10:01.201 --> 10:04.304
and then gets NCIS involved
instead of facing me like a man?

10:04.404 --> 10:06.339
Ah, if you could
slow down.

10:06.439 --> 10:07.975
After everything
he put me through?

10:08.075 --> 10:10.210
Sam got what he deserved,
and now he wants me to, what?

10:10.310 --> 10:11.979
Apologize? I don't think so.

10:12.079 --> 10:13.814
Okay, Miss,
uh, Swenson... Mm.

10:13.914 --> 10:15.548
...do you know
why you're here?

10:15.649 --> 10:18.418
Yeah. Sam's mad
because I trashed his apartment,

10:18.518 --> 10:20.320
and now he wants
to send me a message.

10:20.420 --> 10:23.123
Well, guess what? I have a
message for him, too. It's over.

10:23.223 --> 10:25.092
I never want to see him again.

10:26.459 --> 10:28.028
Well, you may not have to.

10:29.629 --> 10:32.199
Petty Officer Vega
died last night.

10:32.299 --> 10:34.668
What?

10:35.936 --> 10:40.007
His car ran off the road
last night in Rock Creek Park.

10:41.742 --> 10:43.443
He didn't just crash.

10:43.543 --> 10:45.478
Somebody drugged him.

10:45.578 --> 10:48.181
What do you mean, drugged?

10:49.016 --> 10:50.951
Are you saying he was murdered?

10:51.051 --> 10:55.255
Yeah, and it's up to us
to find out who's responsible.

10:55.355 --> 10:57.624
And I'm the suspect?

10:57.725 --> 11:00.393
Well, you did send him
some really threatening texts.

11:00.493 --> 11:02.062
I didn't kill him.

11:02.162 --> 11:03.964
Sam and I were soul mates.

11:04.064 --> 11:06.333
We were going to spend the rest
of our lives together.

11:06.433 --> 11:09.402
Soul mates? You just admitted
to trashing his apartment.

11:09.502 --> 11:11.204
I didn't know he was dead!

11:11.304 --> 11:13.606
Obviously. What kind of person
do you think I am?

11:13.707 --> 11:16.676
Okay, okay, let's...
let's back up here.

11:16.777 --> 11:20.814
What were you doing in his
apartment in the first place?

11:20.914 --> 11:24.785
Sam had been back from
deployment for, like, a week,

11:24.885 --> 11:27.054
and we barely talked, let alone

11:27.154 --> 11:28.789
seen each other.

11:28.889 --> 11:31.491
So I thought I would go over
to his house to surprise him.

11:31.591 --> 11:33.026
Go on.

11:33.126 --> 11:35.028
He wasn't there,

11:35.128 --> 11:36.830
but his laptop was.

11:36.930 --> 11:40.633
So I thought I would just,
you know, take a look at it.

11:40.734 --> 11:42.469
He's really bad
at updating his O.S.

11:42.569 --> 11:44.604
I was just trying to be helpful.

11:45.638 --> 11:47.640
But that's when I found them.

11:47.741 --> 11:49.442
What is "them"?

11:49.542 --> 11:52.179
Emails.

11:52.279 --> 11:55.348
To some girl named Marilyn.

11:55.448 --> 11:58.852
Very, very flirty emails.

11:58.952 --> 12:00.788
Is that when you wrote
the word "liar" on his wall

12:00.888 --> 12:02.322
in your own blood?

12:02.422 --> 12:04.557
I had to get my point across.

12:04.657 --> 12:06.659
What did the emails say?

12:06.760 --> 12:09.296
"I can't wait to see you again."

12:11.064 --> 12:13.700
"I think
we really have something here."

12:13.801 --> 12:16.536
We had something,
but he threw it away.

12:16.636 --> 12:18.138
And now I'm sitting in here,

12:18.238 --> 12:20.540
while this home-wrecker Marilyn
gets away with murder.

12:20.640 --> 12:22.810
What? You're saying
she killed him?

12:22.910 --> 12:25.012
I'll bet when she realized
he wouldn't leave me for her,

12:25.112 --> 12:26.847
she flew into a jealous rage.

12:26.947 --> 12:28.816
She sliced open her own hand?

12:28.916 --> 12:31.251
Miss Swenson certainly is... passionate.

12:31.351 --> 12:33.086
But is she credible?

12:33.186 --> 12:36.323
Well, she does seem to be living
in her own version of reality.

12:36.423 --> 12:40.193
So maybe this Marilyn
doesn't even exist.

12:40.293 --> 12:41.528
Marilyn definitely exists.

12:41.628 --> 12:43.096
The girlfriend was
telling the truth?
Yup.

12:43.196 --> 12:46.299
I was able to trace the I.P.
address on her email headers.

12:46.399 --> 12:48.268
To?
A retirement village

12:48.368 --> 12:50.037
called Sunshine Pines.

12:50.137 --> 12:53.606
I actually toured this place
with my dad years ago.

12:53.706 --> 12:54.908
What a rat trap.

12:55.008 --> 12:56.910
So, this Marilyn
works there?

12:57.010 --> 13:00.213
Uh, I checked all the
employee records. No Marilyn.

13:00.313 --> 13:04.684
Well, if she's not an employee,
does that mean...?

13:04.784 --> 13:06.786
Yup, she's a resident.

13:06.887 --> 13:10.123
Our home-wrecker is...
Marilyn Davis.

13:10.223 --> 13:11.925
How old is she?

13:12.025 --> 13:13.660
85.

13:13.760 --> 13:17.330
This love triangle
just got really weird.

13:24.838 --> 13:26.573
Marilyn Davis is a widow

13:26.673 --> 13:29.276
who's been living at
Sunshine Pines for five years.

13:29.376 --> 13:32.079
Are we sure she's not,
like, Vega's

13:32.179 --> 13:34.247
step-grandma or something?

13:34.347 --> 13:36.316
"I need to see you tonight.

13:36.416 --> 13:39.152
I think we really have
something here."

13:40.387 --> 13:42.122
You talk
to your grandma like that?
Hmm.

13:42.222 --> 13:44.224
Fair enough.

13:44.324 --> 13:45.993
McGEE:
Well, according
to the visitor logs,

13:46.093 --> 13:47.660
Vega visited Marilyn
at Sunshine Pines

13:47.760 --> 13:49.562
several times a week
for several months.

13:49.662 --> 13:51.398
His last visit was yesterday.

13:51.498 --> 13:52.866
The day he was murdered.

13:52.966 --> 13:55.468
Uh, which means
she's probably the last person

13:55.568 --> 13:58.605
to see Vega alive,
so, let's talk to her.

14:01.608 --> 14:03.476
Everything okay?

14:03.576 --> 14:06.379
It's from my dad.
All it says is "911."

14:07.180 --> 14:10.918
You've reached
Roman Parker. Leave a message.

14:11.018 --> 14:13.486
No answer?
Nah. No, no.

14:13.586 --> 14:15.488
Go. Make sure he's okay.
Torres and I can

14:15.588 --> 14:17.257
go talk to Marilyn.
Yeah, we got it, man.

14:17.357 --> 14:19.092
All right. All right.
You've reached Roman Parker.

14:19.192 --> 14:21.161
I'll keep you posted. Thanks.
Leave a message.

14:21.261 --> 14:23.063
Dad, pick up the phone!

14:23.163 --> 14:24.564
You can't send me
a text like that

14:24.664 --> 14:26.633
and not pick up the phone!

14:26.733 --> 14:28.768
Dad?!

14:28.868 --> 14:30.237
Dad, where are you?!

14:30.337 --> 14:32.739
Geez, I'm right here.
What's the matter with you?

14:32.839 --> 14:34.474
What do you mean
what's the matter with me?

14:34.574 --> 14:36.376
Is the building on fire?

14:36.476 --> 14:38.411
No.
Then why are you yelling?

14:38.511 --> 14:40.547
Because you texted "911,"

14:40.647 --> 14:41.982
and then you didn't
pick up your phone!

14:42.082 --> 14:44.084
I almost got a speeding
ticket coming here!

14:44.884 --> 14:47.387
Damn thing's on silent again.

14:47.487 --> 14:49.622
I told you not to text "911"

14:49.722 --> 14:52.559
unless there was a,
you know, emergency!

14:52.659 --> 14:55.628
Well, this is an emergency.
I can't get the remote to work.

14:56.463 --> 14:59.099
A broken remote is
not an emergency.

14:59.199 --> 15:00.800
It's like an oven in here.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.970
Didn't I tell you not
to mess with the thermostat?

15:03.070 --> 15:04.904
Yeah, and I said,
"Quit telling me what to do."

15:05.005 --> 15:08.075
I'm not a child!
Then quit acting like one.

15:08.175 --> 15:09.709
All right. Since you're here,

15:09.809 --> 15:11.244
show me how
to work this thing.

15:11.344 --> 15:14.681
I want to watch
a war movie on cable.

15:14.781 --> 15:16.216
Well, that's a problem,
'cause I don't have cable.

15:16.316 --> 15:17.617
Strictly streaming.

15:17.717 --> 15:19.719
What kind of place
doesn't have cable?

15:19.819 --> 15:21.421
This one.

15:21.521 --> 15:24.324
Even my old
place had cable.

15:24.424 --> 15:25.758
And they barely had hot water.

15:25.858 --> 15:28.161
Well, maybe you should have
thought about that

15:28.261 --> 15:29.963
before you got yourself
kicked out.

15:30.063 --> 15:31.598
Hey, it's not my fault

15:31.698 --> 15:33.400
the ladies can't control
themselves around me. Oh.

15:33.500 --> 15:34.934
Please, Dad. Please.

15:35.035 --> 15:37.270
Your mother always said
I ooze natural charm.

15:38.838 --> 15:40.940
That's more of a curse
than a blessing, really,

15:41.041 --> 15:42.175
but you wouldn't understand,

15:42.275 --> 15:44.477
seeing as you can't even
keep a wife.

15:44.577 --> 15:47.047
When's the last time
you called Viv?

15:47.147 --> 15:48.715
I bet she has cable.

15:48.815 --> 15:50.783
Well, maybe
you should stay with her then.

15:50.883 --> 15:52.919
Maybe I will.
Or would you rather

15:53.020 --> 15:56.889
I dump you in a sad old home
like Sunshine Pines?

16:00.727 --> 16:02.495
A sad old home, huh?

16:02.595 --> 16:05.832
Wow. Parker really
undersold this place.

16:05.932 --> 16:08.601
Yeah, that, or they just
had some major upgrades.

16:08.701 --> 16:10.337
I'd totally live here.

16:10.437 --> 16:12.139
That's really sweet.

16:12.239 --> 16:14.007
You never see
this much family

16:14.107 --> 16:16.009
visiting at a place like...

16:16.109 --> 16:19.346
Wait. You don't think
those kids are, you know?

16:19.446 --> 16:22.049
Okay. Knight,
I don't want to know.

16:22.149 --> 16:23.850
I'm just saying,
maybe Vega...
I don't want to know.

16:23.950 --> 16:25.752
...isn't the only one
who's into the older...

16:25.852 --> 16:27.554
I don't want to know.
Hello, sir.
Well, hello!

16:27.654 --> 16:31.058
Welcome to Sunshine Pines.
I'm Nigel. I run the place.

16:31.158 --> 16:34.927
To start, let me get you two
some brochures, hmm?

16:36.296 --> 16:38.331
Are we looking to move in Mom,

16:38.431 --> 16:39.932
Dad, or both?

16:40.033 --> 16:42.902
We do have a lovely couples
suite available right now.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.137
My dad's in Japan.

16:44.237 --> 16:46.073
My dad walked out on me
when I was five.

16:46.173 --> 16:47.340
Oh.

16:47.440 --> 16:48.975
I'm Agent Knight,
this is Torres.

16:49.076 --> 16:50.343
We're NCIS.

16:50.443 --> 16:52.345
We're here to talk to one

16:52.445 --> 16:53.880
of your residents--
Marilyn Davis.

16:53.980 --> 16:57.550
Of course. She's not
in any trouble, is she?

16:57.650 --> 16:59.252
We just want
to speak with her.

16:59.352 --> 17:02.089
Certainly. Right this way.

17:04.824 --> 17:07.894
Oh, God, my poor Sam.

17:07.994 --> 17:11.164
What am I going
to do without him?

17:11.264 --> 17:13.533
How'd you two meet?

17:13.633 --> 17:17.470
We matched on Grand Bubby.
Uh, it's an app.

17:17.570 --> 17:19.406
It's a dating app?

17:19.506 --> 17:21.040
Oh.

17:21.141 --> 17:23.710
Goodness, no,
Agent Torres.

17:23.810 --> 17:25.712
Uh, uh, well, maybe

17:25.812 --> 17:28.081
if I was 50 years
younger, but...

17:30.450 --> 17:31.751
So what's this Grand Bubby for?

17:31.851 --> 17:34.554
Well, it's for old folks
like myself

17:34.654 --> 17:37.657
to find kind, eager youngsters

17:37.757 --> 17:40.793
to provide companionship,
you know, help us with errands.

17:40.893 --> 17:42.762
You know, that sort of thing.

17:42.862 --> 17:45.832
So all those kids in the
common area are from this app?

17:45.932 --> 17:47.900
Yes.
And how does it work?

17:48.000 --> 17:49.302
Do they get paid?

17:49.402 --> 17:51.504
Well, $20 an hour,

17:51.604 --> 17:55.608
but it was never really
about money for Sam.

17:55.708 --> 17:59.078
Ah, oh, my goodness, I...

17:59.179 --> 18:00.913
Please excuse the mess.

18:01.013 --> 18:05.218
Sam was such a big help
around here, you know? I've just

18:05.318 --> 18:08.455
been on my own since my husband
passed five years ago.

18:08.555 --> 18:11.057
Any other family?

18:11.158 --> 18:13.326
Oh, I have two boys.

18:13.426 --> 18:15.995
But they both have lives
of their own now.

18:16.095 --> 18:19.966
I only see them
a couple times a year.

18:20.933 --> 18:22.802
Can I help you with this?

18:22.902 --> 18:26.105
Oh, well, that is so sweet,

18:26.206 --> 18:29.008
but it's really not worth
your bother.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.844
Oh, it's no bother.
Uh, nail, hammer?

18:31.944 --> 18:35.182
Oh, well, in the drawer
in the kitchen, sweetie.

18:37.384 --> 18:38.951
Well, isn't he a dear?

18:39.051 --> 18:40.387
He is.

18:41.288 --> 18:43.590
Don't tell him I said that. It's
gonna go straight to his head.

18:45.024 --> 18:47.059
Check this out.

18:49.128 --> 18:50.563
Oh.
Oh...

18:50.663 --> 18:51.964
See?

18:52.064 --> 18:55.134
That's exactly what Sam
would've done-- just step

18:55.235 --> 18:57.170
right up on my couch.

18:58.405 --> 19:00.473
Oh.
All right,
there it is.

19:00.573 --> 19:01.808
Oh.
Boom.

19:01.908 --> 19:04.110
Well, it looks wonderful.

19:04.211 --> 19:06.946
Thank you, Agent Torres.

19:08.681 --> 19:10.583
I miss Sammy.

19:10.683 --> 19:13.620
He was the only friend
I had here really.

19:13.720 --> 19:15.955
Well, that can't be true.

19:16.055 --> 19:19.692
Well, the other residents
aren't very nice.

19:19.792 --> 19:23.162
I think
they're just jealous because

19:23.263 --> 19:26.399
Sam matched with me
and not them.

19:26.499 --> 19:29.068
And he was a great kid.

19:29.168 --> 19:33.706
Do you know of anyone who
didn't think he was so great?

19:33.806 --> 19:38.445
I think Sam might have had
some money problems.

19:38.545 --> 19:40.913
My late husband had

19:41.013 --> 19:43.583
a gambling addiction,
and I noticed

19:43.683 --> 19:46.319
some of the same signs in Sam.

19:46.419 --> 19:48.521
Lying, defensiveness.

19:48.621 --> 19:52.525
So, what was it?
Poker? Sports gambling?

19:52.625 --> 19:57.530
He was playing
some online fantasy game.

19:57.630 --> 20:00.032
And I mean, for hours a day.

20:00.132 --> 20:03.836
I-I tried to suggest
that he cut back,

20:03.936 --> 20:06.239
but Sam wouldn't hear it.

20:08.074 --> 20:12.612
I just wished I would have
tried harder to help him.

20:14.281 --> 20:16.949
Maybe he'd still be here.

20:22.455 --> 20:24.156
Hey, guys.
Sorry I was gone so long.

20:24.257 --> 20:26.393
I heard something happened
with your dad.

20:26.493 --> 20:27.760
Everything okay?

20:27.860 --> 20:29.929
He's fine,
but I might not be

20:30.029 --> 20:31.698
if we have
to live together much longer.

20:31.798 --> 20:33.566
Oh, I'm sure
it can't be that bad.

20:33.666 --> 20:35.067
And I'm sure
he's trying to kill me

20:35.167 --> 20:36.936
so he can keep the place
to himself.

20:37.036 --> 20:38.771
Dads can be tough, believe me,

20:38.871 --> 20:40.407
but, uh,
you're doing the right thing.

20:40.507 --> 20:42.475
Yeah. Yeah, I know.
Where are we at with the case?

20:42.575 --> 20:44.076
McGEE:
Well, as it turns out,

20:44.176 --> 20:48.180
Petty Officer Vega had an
obsession with online gambling.

20:48.281 --> 20:49.749
Spent about four hours a day

20:49.849 --> 20:52.051
playing a game called
<i>The Legend of Azaldir.</i>

20:52.151 --> 20:53.353
Vega was in deep.

20:53.453 --> 20:56.489
He lost
over $50,000 playing last year.

20:56.589 --> 20:58.124
Where'd he get
that kind of cash?

20:58.224 --> 20:59.292
Well, we looked

20:59.392 --> 21:01.361
into Vega's Grand Bubby account,

21:01.461 --> 21:04.163
and turns out Marilyn was not

21:04.263 --> 21:05.498
his only match.

21:05.598 --> 21:07.233
And Grand Bubby is...?

21:07.334 --> 21:09.101
Well, at first,
we thought it was a dating app.

21:09.201 --> 21:12.772
Turns out, it's, uh, more
of a grandkids-on-demand thing.

21:12.872 --> 21:15.342
That's a relief.
Right?

21:15.442 --> 21:18.010
Well, Vega matched with
half a dozen other people.

21:18.110 --> 21:20.880
Wealthy people, all people
at the end of their lives.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.715
He matched with a Fred Stevens

21:22.815 --> 21:24.617
three months before he died.

21:24.717 --> 21:28.321
Fred left Vega $10,000
in his will.

21:28.421 --> 21:30.323
That's a nice chunk of change.

21:30.423 --> 21:31.758
And Fred's
not the only one

21:31.858 --> 21:33.893
who left Vega substantial
sums of money.

21:33.993 --> 21:35.762
McGEE:
So either it's a coincidence

21:35.862 --> 21:37.229
that Vega matched
with all these people

21:37.330 --> 21:39.699
after they were diagnosed
with terminal illnesses.

21:39.799 --> 21:41.434
Or he knew who to target,
which means

21:41.534 --> 21:44.236
he was using this app to scam
dying people out of their money.

21:45.405 --> 21:46.706
Looks like our good sailor

21:46.806 --> 21:49.141
might not have been
so good after all.

21:57.950 --> 22:01.253
Petty Officer Vega was matched
with six different

22:01.354 --> 22:03.089
Sunshine Pines residents
in the last year.

22:03.189 --> 22:07.059
Oh, three of them--
Fred, Cynthia and Frances--

22:07.159 --> 22:10.997
all received terminal diagnoses
weeks before they met Vega.

22:11.097 --> 22:12.765
And we think he used this app

22:12.865 --> 22:15.267
to target residents
that were close to death,

22:15.368 --> 22:19.639
then ingratiate himself enough
to get written into their wills.

22:19.739 --> 22:21.240
I'm sure
the families loved that.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.109
Maybe he was killed
by an angry relative.

22:23.209 --> 22:25.144
Oh, you don't want to know
what I would do to anyone

22:25.244 --> 22:28.314
if they ever took advantage
of my <i>abuelita</i> like that.

22:28.415 --> 22:30.783
Probably why Vega
didn't target any residents

22:30.883 --> 22:32.351
with close family.

22:32.452 --> 22:35.021
How did this guy have time
to run this scam?

22:35.121 --> 22:38.024
He was on active military duty,
he worked side gigs,

22:38.124 --> 22:40.126
and he played four hours
of video games a day.

22:40.226 --> 22:41.561
Maybe he had a partner.

22:41.661 --> 22:44.431
Another Grand Bubby user
at the Sunshine Pines.

22:44.531 --> 22:46.566
Who decided to keep the money
all for themselves.

22:46.666 --> 22:47.867
It's a viable theory.

22:47.967 --> 22:49.569
Well, if Vega was working
with someone else

22:49.669 --> 22:51.404
on this app,
we should talk to the residents,

22:51.504 --> 22:53.940
see if any of these kids
got written into their wills.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.008
Good luck with that.
Torres and I already called

22:56.108 --> 22:58.144
every resident on the app.
They wouldn't talk.

22:58.244 --> 23:01.548
Did you tell them that
they might be victims of a scam?

23:01.648 --> 23:03.616
We did, and no one
wants to believe

23:03.716 --> 23:05.452
that their beloved kids
would betray them.

23:05.552 --> 23:06.953
They think
their relationships are genuine,

23:07.053 --> 23:08.455
and they just shut us down.

23:08.555 --> 23:12.725
Well, if the old-timers
won't talk to NCIS,

23:12.825 --> 23:15.995
I know someone
they might open up to.

23:16.095 --> 23:19.499
This is what I'm talking about.
Top-tier living.

23:19.599 --> 23:21.934
My son's been holding out on me.

23:22.034 --> 23:23.903
I can't believe
how nice this place is.

23:24.003 --> 23:25.371
Yeah, you know
what I can't believe?

23:25.472 --> 23:26.639
Making me shack up with him

23:26.739 --> 23:28.675
when I could be living here.

23:28.775 --> 23:30.309
I swear, the last time
I looked at that place,

23:30.409 --> 23:31.944
it was falling apart.

23:32.044 --> 23:35.214
You can admit that you like
living with your dad. It's okay.

23:35.314 --> 23:37.517
That is not
what's happening here.

23:37.617 --> 23:39.619
Can you hear me, Alden? Huh?

23:39.719 --> 23:41.387
We're gonna talk
about this later.

23:41.488 --> 23:43.956
Uh, sir, yes, we can hear you,

23:44.056 --> 23:45.758
but just pretend
that we're not here, okay?

23:45.858 --> 23:48.327
Yeah, is that why you sent me
in here with him? Huh?

23:48.427 --> 23:50.196
Because <i>you</i> didn't
want to face me?

23:50.296 --> 23:52.465
Roman, come here.
Come here. Come on.

23:53.633 --> 23:57.403
I am the only NCIS agent that
hasn't been here before, okay?

23:57.504 --> 24:00.206
So, I am your son
for the next 30 minutes.

24:00.306 --> 24:01.874
Ah. Do you have cable?

24:01.974 --> 24:03.209
Yeah.

24:03.309 --> 24:05.077
Then how about forever?

24:05.177 --> 24:08.515
Hi, there! And who do I have
the pleasure of meeting today?

24:08.615 --> 24:11.851
Hi. I'm Tim.
This is my father Roman.

24:11.951 --> 24:13.319
When can I move in?

24:15.054 --> 24:17.423
Uh, Dad, we-we should really
weigh our options carefully.

24:17.524 --> 24:19.425
Let's at least
take a tour here.

24:19.526 --> 24:21.661
Your son is right, Roman.
This is a big decision.

24:21.761 --> 24:24.263
Not if you saw
where I was living now.

24:24.363 --> 24:26.065
Well, let me show you
around our facility.

24:26.165 --> 24:27.800
I think you'll find

24:27.900 --> 24:29.969
we really are world-class.
Listen.

24:30.069 --> 24:32.505
Is there any way that my father
could maybe talk

24:32.605 --> 24:34.841
to the residents?
Kind of help him

24:34.941 --> 24:36.743
get an insider point of view?
Would that be possible?

24:36.843 --> 24:39.411
Absolutely.
Right this way, Roman.

24:43.516 --> 24:45.117
Little bit of gin rummy
for the ladies.

24:45.217 --> 24:46.686
Thank you.
For you.

24:46.786 --> 24:49.856
Nancy, Leora, Bud,
this is Roman.

24:49.956 --> 24:52.291
Can he join you while
I show his son around the place?

24:52.391 --> 24:55.595
That depends.
You play cards, Roman?

24:55.695 --> 24:57.363
My game's gin.

24:57.463 --> 24:58.998
Have a seat.

24:59.098 --> 25:00.132
Yeah.

25:00.232 --> 25:01.467
Five-dollar buy-in.

25:01.568 --> 25:04.136
Ah. Hey, son?
Yeah.

25:04.236 --> 25:05.638
Spot me a Lincoln?

25:05.738 --> 25:08.340
McGEE: Ooh, uh,
all I have is a Jackson.

25:08.440 --> 25:10.142
That'll do.

25:10.242 --> 25:13.012
Okay. Have, uh...
have fun, Dad. Hmm.

25:13.112 --> 25:15.147
We'll be back.

25:16.148 --> 25:18.150
Okay. Who's dealing?

25:18.250 --> 25:20.219
Your dad's fitting in already.

25:20.319 --> 25:21.754
Seems like
he's made up his mind.

25:21.854 --> 25:23.389
Well, I'm a tougher sell.

25:23.489 --> 25:24.924
I get it.

25:25.024 --> 25:27.560
You want to make sure
your father's in the best hands.

25:27.660 --> 25:29.295
Have I mentioned

25:29.395 --> 25:31.297
our state-of-the-art
medical facility?

25:31.397 --> 25:32.732
We're the only home
in the area

25:32.832 --> 25:34.967
that can perform full,
life-saving measures

25:35.067 --> 25:37.036
at a moment's notice.

25:37.136 --> 25:38.571
Wow. That's impressive.

25:38.671 --> 25:40.139
Let me ask you.

25:40.239 --> 25:41.874
Is there a resident's room
that we could look at?

25:41.974 --> 25:43.710
My dad's very particular
about his space.

25:43.810 --> 25:46.846
As he should be. Follow me.

25:47.880 --> 25:51.818
Gin! And Roman
loses another one.

25:51.918 --> 25:54.220
I'm just getting warmed up here.

25:54.320 --> 25:55.487
Sure you are.

25:55.588 --> 25:58.090
I hope
you'll be moving in soon, Roman.

25:58.190 --> 26:01.661
Hell, if it were up to me,
I'd move in tomorrow. Oh.

26:01.761 --> 26:03.663
This place must be expensive.

26:03.763 --> 26:06.733
It's a hell of a lot nicer
than my old home.

26:06.833 --> 26:09.135
Most of the upgrades are recent.

26:09.235 --> 26:11.838
All thanks to a Mr. Greystone.

26:11.938 --> 26:15.141
Do we know who this Greystone
is? Did that ever come up?

26:15.241 --> 26:17.509
No. Maybe it's one
of their relatives?

26:17.610 --> 26:19.045
All right, let's find out.

26:19.145 --> 26:20.780
Dad, you're up.

26:20.880 --> 26:22.815
Ask who this Greystone guy is.

26:22.915 --> 26:26.152
Is this, uh,
Mr. Greystone one of your kids?

26:26.252 --> 26:30.222
Oh. My kids dumped me here
and never looked back.

26:30.322 --> 26:31.958
They won't even visit,

26:32.058 --> 26:34.861
let alone give this place
any more cash than they have to.

26:34.961 --> 26:37.596
So, uh,
who's this Greystone guy?

26:37.697 --> 26:38.898
We don't know.

26:38.998 --> 26:42.068
Some anonymous rich guy
we figure.

26:42.168 --> 26:43.770
He's the best thing
that's happened

26:43.870 --> 26:45.537
to this place
since Grand Bubby.

26:45.638 --> 26:47.273
That's an app, right?

26:47.373 --> 26:49.241
Yes. You're on it?

26:49.341 --> 26:50.542
No, no. Oh.

26:50.643 --> 26:52.044
Should I be?

26:52.144 --> 26:53.646
Oh, absolutely.

26:53.746 --> 26:57.516
Oh, I met so many nice kids
on Grand Bubby.

26:57.616 --> 26:59.051
Okay, Dad, we need to know

26:59.151 --> 27:01.253
if any of them
have changed their wills.

27:01.353 --> 27:02.621
I'm getting there!

27:05.758 --> 27:07.059
You okay, Roman?

27:07.159 --> 27:08.194
Uh, yeah.

27:08.294 --> 27:10.196
Uh, just looking at my hand.

27:10.296 --> 27:12.799
I'm finally getting
some decent cards.

27:12.899 --> 27:15.467
You're not supposed
to tell us that.

27:15.567 --> 27:18.070
And you're not supposed
to tell <i>him</i> that.

27:18.170 --> 27:20.072
No coaching, Leora.

27:20.172 --> 27:21.440
Ya flirt.

27:21.540 --> 27:22.942
Oh, here we go.

27:23.042 --> 27:27.379
Uh, these-these Grand Bubby
kids-- they sound great.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.248
How close are you all?

27:29.348 --> 27:31.918
Very. Especially with...

27:32.018 --> 27:34.620
How about you, Roman?
You and your son are close?

27:34.721 --> 27:36.055
Too close.

27:36.155 --> 27:38.024
We're living together
until I find a new place.

27:38.124 --> 27:40.760
And you're complaining?
Our kids don't even visit,

27:40.860 --> 27:43.095
and yours lets you
live with him?

27:43.195 --> 27:45.397
Well, living
with your kid is...

27:45.497 --> 27:48.000
is not all
it's cracked up to be.

27:48.100 --> 27:51.804
Yeah, puts a real damper
on your social life.

27:53.305 --> 27:55.274
Social life here is great.

27:56.142 --> 28:00.713
Now why don't you and I go check
out the shuffleboard court?

28:00.813 --> 28:02.982
I think he'd rather play

28:03.082 --> 28:05.517
shuffleboard with me, Leora.

28:05.617 --> 28:06.753
Roman?

28:06.853 --> 28:08.487
There is
no shuffleboard court here.

28:08.587 --> 28:10.356
That's code.

28:10.456 --> 28:12.124
Ah.

28:12.224 --> 28:14.360
Code for what?

28:14.460 --> 28:16.829
You know what it's code for.

28:16.929 --> 28:19.498
My dad hasn't
played shuffleboard

28:19.598 --> 28:22.001
with anyone since my mom, okay?

28:22.101 --> 28:25.104
Sure. If that's what you need
to tell yourself.

28:25.204 --> 28:26.906
I think it's the hair.

28:27.006 --> 28:29.108
All right, all right,
we're getting off topic here.

28:30.276 --> 28:32.444
Are you ladies going

28:32.544 --> 28:34.346
to show our guest
the grounds?

28:34.446 --> 28:36.248
It is a beautiful day.

28:36.348 --> 28:37.850
Get lost, Marilyn.

28:37.950 --> 28:40.352
Yeah, this one's ours.

28:40.452 --> 28:43.389
Ladies, please. There's enough
of me to go around.

28:43.489 --> 28:45.925
I'm Roman. And you are?

28:46.025 --> 28:47.459
Leaving.

28:47.559 --> 28:51.063
I'm Marilyn Davis, room 125.

28:51.163 --> 28:52.398
Ah. Roman Parker.

28:52.498 --> 28:54.100
I'm pleased to meet you.

28:54.200 --> 28:55.467
Roman's a sailor.

28:55.567 --> 28:56.735
Oh.

28:56.836 --> 29:00.272
Marilyn has a thing
for Navy men.

29:00.372 --> 29:01.740
Oh.

29:01.841 --> 29:03.810
Is that so?

29:07.279 --> 29:09.681
Yo, yo.
Oh, hey.

29:09.782 --> 29:11.017
Nick, have you heard
from Parker?

29:11.117 --> 29:13.185
Yes, and I think
he's having regrets.

29:13.285 --> 29:14.753
Ooh, I take it

29:14.854 --> 29:16.188
Operation Undercover Grandpa
isn't going so well?

29:16.288 --> 29:18.457
That's what I've been
calling it in my head.

29:18.557 --> 29:21.693
Until now. I just said it out
loud, and now I have regrets.

29:21.794 --> 29:24.663
We got to find another way
to, uh, find this killer.

29:24.763 --> 29:28.000
Oh, well, I ran
the walnut oil and linen

29:28.100 --> 29:30.302
that Jimmy found on Vega's
hands through the AMS.

29:30.402 --> 29:33.105
And I found out something
very interesting.

29:33.205 --> 29:34.340
Hmm.

29:34.440 --> 29:37.009
The linen is at least
400 years old.

29:37.109 --> 29:38.945
And that's gonna help us
find the killer how?

29:39.045 --> 29:40.479
Well, I said it was
interesting, Nick.

29:40.579 --> 29:42.281
I never promised anything
about finding a killer.

29:42.381 --> 29:43.582
I'm kidding. Kidding.

29:43.682 --> 29:44.984
I just have to keep digging

29:45.084 --> 29:46.518
to figure out
where it came from.

29:46.618 --> 29:48.687
Well, we're gonna have to dig
faster 'cause I don't think,

29:48.787 --> 29:50.656
uh, Roman's going
to last much longer undercover.

29:50.756 --> 29:52.724
Good news.
He won't have to.

29:52.825 --> 29:54.927
I finally heard
from my friend at the FDA.

29:55.027 --> 29:57.596
The propofol used to kill Vega
came from the medical unit

29:57.696 --> 30:00.299
at the Sunshine Pines
Retirement Village.

30:00.399 --> 30:02.101
As in the place

30:02.201 --> 30:04.904
that McGee and Parker's dad
are at right now?
Yeah.

30:05.004 --> 30:06.572
And Sunshine Pines has

30:06.672 --> 30:08.207
an automated
medication dispensing system

30:08.307 --> 30:10.910
that requires
a user's I.D. to access.

30:11.010 --> 30:12.945
Ah! All we have to do
is look up the user,

30:13.045 --> 30:14.813
and we can find
Vega's killer.

30:14.914 --> 30:16.348
That's what I'm talking about.

30:16.448 --> 30:18.484
Not that your 400-year-old,

30:18.584 --> 30:20.019
uh, fabric wasn't interesting.

30:20.119 --> 30:21.888
Hmm.

30:23.289 --> 30:26.192
And, of course, there's
our state-of-the-art rec room.

30:26.292 --> 30:28.427
We have ceramics class
on Wednesdays.

30:28.527 --> 30:31.230
Uh, Dad's more of a yoga guy.
We have that, too!

30:31.330 --> 30:34.000
And a meditation class.
Are there any other rooms

30:34.100 --> 30:36.468
you'd like to see
before we talk pricing?

30:36.568 --> 30:40.973
Uh, no, but there's a room
I'd like to show <i>you.</i>

30:41.073 --> 30:43.475
Can you tell us
what that is, Nigel?

30:45.277 --> 30:47.713
I'm sorry. I don't know
what I'm looking at.

30:47.813 --> 30:49.381
Okay, let me
give you a hint.

30:49.481 --> 30:52.084
It's the propofol vial
that you stole

30:52.184 --> 30:54.753
from the Sunshine Pines
medical unit.

30:54.853 --> 30:56.322
Which you used
to knock out Sam Vega

30:56.422 --> 30:58.290
when you sent his car
over a cliff.

30:58.390 --> 31:00.960
Oh. Uh, no,
you got the wrong guy.

31:01.060 --> 31:05.097
Well, you look pretty guilty
from where we're sitting.

31:05.197 --> 31:07.900
Your badge was used
to access the medication unit

31:08.000 --> 31:10.102
when the propofol was taken.

31:11.070 --> 31:13.906
Okay, I know how this must look,

31:14.006 --> 31:16.275
but-but all I'm guilty of
is losing my badge.

31:16.375 --> 31:18.844
Someone else must have used it
to access the medical unit.

31:18.945 --> 31:20.546
That's convenient.

31:20.646 --> 31:23.315
I'm not lying to you!
Why on earth would I kill Sam?!

31:23.415 --> 31:26.118
Because with your partner
out of the picture,

31:26.218 --> 31:28.120
you could keep
all that money.

31:28.220 --> 31:30.822
What money?!
The money that was left

31:30.923 --> 31:35.061
to him by dying
Sunshine Pines residents.

31:35.161 --> 31:36.795
You think
Sam was scamming our residents,

31:36.895 --> 31:38.430
and that I was his partner?

31:38.530 --> 31:39.932
The only way

31:40.032 --> 31:42.301
that he would know
which residents to target was

31:42.401 --> 31:44.203
if he had a partner
that had access

31:44.303 --> 31:46.605
to their medical
and financial records.

31:46.705 --> 31:48.340
McGEE:
You are the only employee

31:48.440 --> 31:50.943
at Sunshine Pines
who has access to both.

31:51.043 --> 31:52.578
Wait, wait, wait.

31:52.678 --> 31:54.313
You guys got this all wrong.

31:54.413 --> 31:56.515
Sam wasn't stealing money
from the residents.

31:56.615 --> 31:58.184
He was giving it to them.

31:59.585 --> 32:01.087
You saw our latest remodel.
Where do you think

32:01.187 --> 32:03.255
we got the money from?
Wait. Now hold on.

32:03.355 --> 32:06.993
Are you saying
that Sam Vega is Mr. Greystone,

32:07.093 --> 32:09.195
the anonymous donor?

32:09.295 --> 32:10.997
Yes.

32:11.097 --> 32:13.032
Sam wasn't scamming
the Sunshine Pines residents.

32:13.132 --> 32:14.967
He was helping them.

32:24.643 --> 32:27.846
Sam Vega is Mr. Greystone.

32:27.946 --> 32:30.549
And Nigel Yang has the receipts
to prove it.

32:30.649 --> 32:32.618
So Vega <i>wasn't</i> scamming anyone?

32:32.718 --> 32:34.620
No, turns out he really
<i>was</i> a good guy,

32:34.720 --> 32:36.055
trying to do right
by the residents.

32:36.155 --> 32:38.190
He might've, uh, spent $50,000

32:38.290 --> 32:39.758
playing <i>The Legend of Azaldir,</i>

32:39.858 --> 32:43.195
but he made ten times that
in his winnings.

32:43.295 --> 32:44.863
Donated it all
to Sunshine Pines.

32:44.963 --> 32:47.033
Wanted to honor the
grandmother who raised him.

32:47.133 --> 32:49.501
Well, then, who sent him
off the side of the cliff?

32:49.601 --> 32:52.071
We know the killer had access
to Yang's I.D. card.

32:52.171 --> 32:54.473
That's how
he got hold of that propofol.

32:54.573 --> 32:56.542
Which means he's somehow
connected to Sunshine Pines.

32:56.642 --> 32:58.844
Could it be someone else
on Grand Bubby?

32:58.944 --> 33:01.113
Well, every kid we checked
has had a solid alibi.

33:01.213 --> 33:02.681
What about the staff?

33:02.781 --> 33:04.683
Uh, if we start hauling them in,
the killer could rabbit.

33:04.783 --> 33:06.685
We need somebody
on the inside

33:06.785 --> 33:08.754
to point us
in the right direction.

33:08.854 --> 33:11.223
Someone other
than my dad.

33:11.323 --> 33:12.591
Hey, what about Marilyn?

33:12.691 --> 33:14.360
She's been there awhile,
seems to know the place.

33:14.460 --> 33:17.196
Worth a shot. It's not like
we're swimming in leads here.

33:17.296 --> 33:18.464
I'll go.

33:18.564 --> 33:20.666
Jumped on that one
kind of quick.

33:20.766 --> 33:23.135
Well, I like her.
She reminds me of my <i>abuela.</i>

33:31.143 --> 33:32.378
Marilyn?

33:32.478 --> 33:33.745
Maybe she's napping.

33:33.845 --> 33:35.581
It's Agent Torres and Knight.

33:35.681 --> 33:37.783
You two here to see Marilyn?

33:37.883 --> 33:39.918
You're gonna be waiting a while.
She's out for the evening.

33:40.018 --> 33:41.353
She's out?

33:41.453 --> 33:43.422
Did one of her sons
finally show up to see her?

33:43.522 --> 33:44.856
Marilyn doesn't have any kids.

33:44.956 --> 33:48.394
I'm pretty sure
she said she <i>had</i> kids.

33:48.494 --> 33:51.130
Why would she lie to us?

33:52.564 --> 33:53.999
Can you open this?

33:54.100 --> 33:55.767
Are you family?

33:56.702 --> 34:00.106
Hmm. Well, works for me.

34:06.278 --> 34:07.946
Where'd she go?

34:09.315 --> 34:11.683
Maybe she has an appointment
book or something?

34:11.783 --> 34:13.652
Kasie, what's up?

34:13.752 --> 34:15.587
I finally identified
the substances

34:15.687 --> 34:17.256
underneath Vega's fingernails.

34:17.356 --> 34:21.760
Oil-based paint and canvas
from the 17th century.

34:21.860 --> 34:23.362
Ask Marilyn

34:23.462 --> 34:25.864
if she has any idea how Vega
would have come in contact

34:25.964 --> 34:29.568
with a 400-year-old painting.

34:29.668 --> 34:31.303
I think I have an idea.

34:31.403 --> 34:33.239
Now we just have to find her.

34:33.339 --> 34:35.274
Found her.

34:35.374 --> 34:37.109
I have a time
and an address.

34:37.209 --> 34:38.810
Shall we go crash
the party?

34:38.910 --> 34:41.547
Well, they don't call me "Party
Crasher Torres" for nothing.

34:42.348 --> 34:43.582
Nobody calls you that.

34:43.682 --> 34:45.451
You're right.

34:52.458 --> 34:55.294
What could Marilyn
possibly be doing here?

34:55.394 --> 34:57.229
Well, we're about to find out.

34:59.498 --> 35:00.732
We're gonna need a code.

35:00.832 --> 35:03.935
Hang on.
I think she wrote it down.

35:13.812 --> 35:15.414
Can I help you?

35:15.514 --> 35:17.749
Marilyn Davis?

35:22.454 --> 35:25.123
Is that a live piano player?

35:25.224 --> 35:27.359
What the hell is this place?

35:27.459 --> 35:28.994
Estate sale?

35:29.094 --> 35:30.962
And I'm thinking
the shady kind.

35:38.136 --> 35:39.405
Marilyn's painting.

35:39.505 --> 35:41.139
Yes, it is.

35:41.240 --> 35:43.575
And is that Marilyn?

35:43.675 --> 35:46.912
Wow. She cleans up nice.

35:48.914 --> 35:51.750
Yeah, she doesn't remind me
of my <i>abuela</i> anymore.

35:52.584 --> 35:55.654
Oh, Dmitri.

35:56.688 --> 35:57.889
This is offensive.

35:57.989 --> 35:59.791
You know I can't sell this

35:59.891 --> 36:02.228
for anything less
than seven figures.

36:02.328 --> 36:05.464
People, underneath
this cheap facade

36:05.564 --> 36:09.735
is an original Lionelli
from 1660.

36:09.835 --> 36:12.103
I mean, it has
hung in museums

36:12.204 --> 36:13.372
all over the world.

36:13.472 --> 36:14.540
And now, your clients

36:14.640 --> 36:16.775
have the very rare opportunity

36:16.875 --> 36:19.211
to acquire it
for their private collections.

36:19.311 --> 36:22.180
So... who will be taking

36:22.281 --> 36:26.084
this wonderful piece of art
home tonight, huh?

36:27.052 --> 36:28.587
We will.

36:30.356 --> 36:32.791
I got him. Yeah.

36:34.460 --> 36:37.296
Hey, Marilyn.
You look nice.

36:37.396 --> 36:38.430
Surprised to see me?

36:42.834 --> 36:45.070
You idiot,
what are you doing?!

36:46.872 --> 36:48.674
Ooh!
I am sorry.

36:48.774 --> 36:50.909
I am so sorry.
Sorry for what?

36:51.009 --> 36:53.279
That kid didn't deserve to die.

36:53.379 --> 36:55.547
Then why'd you do it?
She threatened to leave me

36:55.647 --> 36:56.948
unless I took him out.

36:57.048 --> 37:00.185
What? I... I loved Sam!
How could you?!

37:00.286 --> 37:02.554
Cut the act, Marilyn! We know
you swiped Yang's access badge

37:02.654 --> 37:04.390
to steal the propofol.

37:04.490 --> 37:06.558
Go on. Keep talking.

37:06.658 --> 37:09.060
I want a lawyer.

37:09.961 --> 37:11.930
It's a good idea.
In the meantime...

37:12.030 --> 37:13.732
You're under arrest
for the murder

37:13.832 --> 37:16.302
of Petty Officer Sam Vega.

37:16.402 --> 37:18.437
I still love you, baby.

37:18.537 --> 37:19.838
Ugh!

37:25.644 --> 37:28.514
So there really is a Renaissance
masterpiece under here?

37:28.614 --> 37:30.416
Kasie confirmed it
with an X-ray.

37:30.516 --> 37:33.885
It was stolen from the Museo
del Prado in Madrid in 2007.

37:33.985 --> 37:35.287
Turns out Marilyn's

37:35.387 --> 37:37.188
deceased husband
wasn't just an art lover.

37:37.289 --> 37:38.590
He was an art thief.

37:38.690 --> 37:41.760
He stored stolen paintings
in free-trade zones

37:41.860 --> 37:43.362
all over Europe.

37:43.462 --> 37:45.364
Waiting for the heat to die down
before he could sell 'em.

37:45.464 --> 37:46.765
I assume
he waited too long.

37:46.865 --> 37:48.367
Heart attack got him first.

37:48.467 --> 37:50.068
Yeah, after her husband died,
Marilyn needed a way

37:50.168 --> 37:52.738
to smuggle the pieces back
into the U.S. undetected.

37:52.838 --> 37:54.906
So she joined up
with Grand Bubby,

37:55.006 --> 37:57.208
targeted Navy sailors
headed for deployment.

37:57.309 --> 37:58.644
Vega wasn't her first.

37:58.744 --> 38:00.679
One of her previous matches

38:00.779 --> 38:03.014
was deployed to Bahrain.
She had him pick up

38:03.114 --> 38:05.551
a package from the FTZ there
and bring it back for her.

38:05.651 --> 38:07.753
Sailors usually breeze
through Customs.

38:07.853 --> 38:10.322
Except Vega was
an art history major.

38:10.422 --> 38:13.759
When he picked up the painting,
he noticed the ancient canvas,

38:13.859 --> 38:15.961
told her
she should get it appraised.

38:16.061 --> 38:17.896
Marilyn got nervous that
Vega was gonna figure out

38:17.996 --> 38:19.565
what she was doing,

38:19.665 --> 38:21.733
so she had her lover, slash,
business partner take him out.

38:21.833 --> 38:23.769
Wow. Vega joined Grand Bubby
wanting to help,

38:23.869 --> 38:25.904
and look at where it got him.

38:26.004 --> 38:28.340
I hope this won't stop
the kids from, uh, signing up.

38:28.440 --> 38:31.610
Actually, the app's been
shut down pending investigation.

38:31.710 --> 38:33.812
Well, that's a shame.

38:33.912 --> 38:35.814
The residents were getting
so much out of it.

38:35.914 --> 38:38.350
Yeah. So what happens
with all those <i>abuelas?</i>

38:38.450 --> 38:40.218
They don't get visits
from their kids?

38:40.318 --> 38:43.789
Looks like it,
for now, at least.

38:45.223 --> 38:46.658
That's a bummer.

38:46.758 --> 38:49.327
Yeah.

38:49.428 --> 38:51.062
Cheater!

38:51.162 --> 38:52.531
Oh, really?
Oh!

38:52.631 --> 38:53.632
Oh, come on, Bud.

38:53.732 --> 38:55.867
Don't be a sore loser.

38:55.967 --> 38:57.636
No one told me
this kid is a card shark.

38:57.736 --> 38:58.970
Hey, man, I don't know
what to tell you.

38:59.070 --> 39:00.706
I mean, I...
I'm a man of many talents.

39:00.806 --> 39:02.841
Okay, so we have Nancy
in the lead

39:02.941 --> 39:04.476
with 15, then we have

39:04.576 --> 39:05.544
Tim, Nick,

39:05.644 --> 39:07.245
Leora, me,

39:07.345 --> 39:09.748
and then we have Bud
bringing up the rear

39:09.848 --> 39:11.216
with a whopping 302.

39:12.484 --> 39:13.585
Ooh!

39:13.685 --> 39:15.086
Poor Bud, poor Bud.

39:16.555 --> 39:18.824
I say we double the stakes
for the next round.

39:18.924 --> 39:21.259
Ooh.
Ooh. All right.

39:23.261 --> 39:24.863
Check out the size
of this place.

39:24.963 --> 39:27.198
Bigger than your
old room, huh?
Yeah.

39:27.298 --> 39:29.200
I could have
parties in here.

39:29.300 --> 39:31.002
Yeah, as long as you don't
get kicked out again.

39:31.102 --> 39:32.671
It's much more modern, too.

39:32.771 --> 39:34.840
Plus, they have cable.

39:34.940 --> 39:37.909
Hey, Dad, check this.
Individual thermostats.

39:38.009 --> 39:41.212
Ah. No one to get on my case
about the temperature.

39:41.312 --> 39:43.949
Nice.
Well, what do you think?

39:44.049 --> 39:45.951
We got a winner here?

39:46.918 --> 39:48.420
What?

39:48.520 --> 39:50.689
What is it this time?

39:50.789 --> 39:52.524
You know,
Sunshine Pines is a dream,

39:52.624 --> 39:56.394
but if I move, that means
I'd be leaving you alone.

39:58.630 --> 40:02.267
Dad, thanks for thinking of me,
but if this is your dream,

40:02.367 --> 40:03.935
then...

40:04.035 --> 40:06.438
I insist you follow it.
I'll survive.

40:06.538 --> 40:09.174
We'll still have
our weekly games of Risk?

40:09.274 --> 40:10.809
Yeah.

40:11.977 --> 40:14.012
Then it's settled. Yeah.

40:14.112 --> 40:16.347
I'll sign the paperwork
today, okay?

40:17.282 --> 40:22.053
You know, I don't say it enough,
but, uh, thanks...

40:23.421 --> 40:28.026
...for being a good son
and a good man.

40:28.827 --> 40:30.796
Thanks, Dad.

40:31.563 --> 40:33.164
Yeah.

40:35.200 --> 40:37.102
Though, your sister
is an admiral.

40:37.202 --> 40:39.938
I never understood
why you didn't join up.

40:40.038 --> 40:42.007
I have other interests.

40:42.107 --> 40:45.176
Yeah? Well, cooking
obviously isn't one of them.

40:45.276 --> 40:46.912
What's the matter
with my cooking?

40:47.012 --> 40:50.015
Salt. Ever heard of it?

40:50.115 --> 40:53.184
Why don't we watch
some cable, okay?

40:54.452 --> 40:56.054
And...

40:56.154 --> 40:57.856
there's no need
to keep your apartment

40:57.956 --> 40:59.424
feeling like a meat locker.

41:01.059 --> 41:02.594
This one again?

41:02.694 --> 41:03.862
I thought
this was your favorite.

41:03.962 --> 41:06.297
That was last week. Keep up.

41:06.397 --> 41:08.333
Fine. You pick.
