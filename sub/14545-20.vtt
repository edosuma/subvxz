WEBVTT

00:02.970 --> 00:06.340
...AND UNLIKE A WOODEN HANGER,
IT WILL NEVER DEPRECIATE.

00:06.407 --> 00:08.276
(Tessa) IN CHATSWIN,
THERE WAS NO END

00:08.342 --> 00:11.079
TO WHAT PEOPLE WERE WILLING
TO SPEND MONEY ON.

00:11.145 --> 00:12.746
NOAH HAD INVESTED
IN THE BEST SURROGATE

00:12.813 --> 00:16.417
THAT MONEY COULD BUY,
BUT IN THE PROCESS...

00:16.484 --> 00:19.053
WHOA. WHOA. (chuckles)
EL SCORCHO.

00:19.120 --> 00:20.988
(chuckles) PRETTY HEAVY HAND
WITH THE PEPPER THERE.

00:21.055 --> 00:23.424
HE HAD BECOME OVERLY INVESTED.

00:23.491 --> 00:25.893
PEPPER IS QUITE HEALTHFUL, NOAH.
IT'S AN ANTIOXIDANT.

00:25.959 --> 00:29.797
I'M VERY SENSITIVE TO SPICE.
CHANCES ARE, MY BABY IS AS WELL.

00:29.863 --> 00:31.799
(mouth full) IF EAT ANYTHING
THAT UPSETS THE BABY,

00:31.865 --> 00:32.933
I'LL BE THE FIRST TO KNOW.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.001
I'M NOT SO SURE ABOUT THAT.

00:34.068 --> 00:36.036
US WERNERS TEND TO SUFFER
IN SILENCE.

00:36.104 --> 00:37.671
(utensil clinks)

00:37.738 --> 00:39.507
THE MEN DO, ANYWAY.

00:39.573 --> 00:41.242
YOU KNOW, I JUST FIND
ALICIA KEYS TO BE

00:41.309 --> 00:43.244
A VERY BEAUTIFUL WOMAN.
THAT'S ALL.

00:43.311 --> 00:46.046
(mouth full) NO ONE IS ARGUING
WITH YOU, DAD. NO ONE.

00:46.114 --> 00:47.748
DO WE REALLY HAVE TO TALK
ABOUT THIS?

00:47.815 --> 00:50.751
YOUR MOTHER IS DISTRACTED, LISA,
SO THIS IS THE PERFECT TIME

00:50.818 --> 00:52.120
TO TALK ABOUT ALICIA KEYS.

00:52.186 --> 00:53.354
HEY, THERE SHE IS.

00:53.421 --> 00:54.622
(mouth full) GEORGE!
I MISSED YOU.

00:54.688 --> 00:56.924
NOAH WAS PROTECTIVE
OVER HIS INVESTMENT,

00:56.990 --> 00:59.827
AND THE FACT THAT
DAD WAS DATING HER DIDN'T HELP.

00:59.893 --> 01:03.131
GEORGE! COME... PEE WITH ME.

01:03.197 --> 01:04.565
WHAT'S WITH ALL
THE SEXUAL CHEMISTRY OUT THERE

01:04.632 --> 01:06.367
BETWEEN YOU AND EDEN?
I THOUGHT WE HAD AN AGREEMENT.

01:06.434 --> 01:09.137
I DIDN'T AGREE TO NOT HAVE
SEXUAL CHEMISTRY WITH HER.

01:09.203 --> 01:09.803
LOOK AT HER, MAN.

01:09.870 --> 01:12.072
SHE'S GORGEOUS,
AND I'M CRAZY ABOUT HER.

01:12.140 --> 01:13.207
WHAT?
WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

01:13.274 --> 01:16.477
PICTURE HER INSIDES
FULL OF BLOOD AND MUCUS

01:16.544 --> 01:18.346
AND BABY BONES.

01:18.412 --> 01:19.880
I AM SO TURNED ON
RIGHT NOW.

01:19.947 --> 01:21.882
NOT FUNNY, GEORGE!
IT'S NOT.

01:21.949 --> 01:23.251
LOOK, EVERY TIME I CLOSE
MY EYES,

01:23.317 --> 01:25.519
ALL I CAN SEE IS
MY BEAUTIFUL FETUS

01:25.586 --> 01:28.122
BATHING IN YOUR GERMS
AND YOUR SALIVA.

01:28.189 --> 01:29.790
IT'S LIKE EVERY TIME
YOU GROPE HER,

01:29.857 --> 01:32.626
YOU'RE GROPING MY BABY
WITH YOUR MEATY PEASANT HANDS!

01:32.693 --> 01:35.163
HOW FAR HAVE YOU GONE?
TELL ME. TELL ME THE TRUTH.

01:35.229 --> 01:37.365
I TOLD YOU.
WE MADE OUT ONCE.

01:37.431 --> 01:38.732
YEAH, BUT NOT SINCE
THE AGREEMENT, RIGHT?

01:38.799 --> 01:40.100
NOT SINCE, RIGHT?

01:40.168 --> 01:43.404
(sighs) WE'RE DATING.
I'VE KISSED HER.

01:43.471 --> 01:46.574
YOU KISSED HER WHERE?
ON HER FACE?

01:46.640 --> 01:48.709
ON HER MOUTH?
INSIDE HER MOUTH?

01:48.776 --> 01:50.244
DID YOU KISS HER
INSIDE HER MOUTH, GEORGE?

01:50.311 --> 01:52.846
DAMN IT! TELL ME.
I HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW.

01:52.913 --> 01:55.416
NOAH, YOU'RE LOSING
YOUR MIND. PLEASE RELAX.

01:55.483 --> 01:58.051
I DIDN'T WANT IT TO COME
TO THIS, BUT IT HAS.

01:58.118 --> 01:59.720
THINGS HAVE GOTTEN BLURRY,
TOO BLURRY.

01:59.787 --> 02:03.357
(sniffles) IT'S TIME THAT
WE PROPERLY DEFINED THEM.

02:03.424 --> 02:06.860
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
A CONTRACT? (chuckles)

02:06.927 --> 02:08.429
OKAY, THIS--
THIS IS CRAZY, MAN.

02:08.496 --> 02:10.964
NO. YOU'RE CRAZY, MAN.

02:11.031 --> 02:14.402
WHO DATES A WOMAN FULL OF BLOOD
AND MUCUS AND BABY BONES?

02:14.468 --> 02:16.470
LOOK, IT'S EVERYTHING
YOU AGREED TO WHEN WE SHOOK.

02:16.537 --> 02:19.640
THIS IS JUST RESHAKING,
BUT WITH A PEN.

02:24.478 --> 02:27.080
WELL, I'M A NOTARY.
YOU KNOW I'M A NOTARY.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.782
I DIDN'T KNOW.

02:33.921 --> 02:35.523
HELLO, SHEILA.

02:39.293 --> 02:41.762
AS A CONCERNED NEIGHBOR,
I FEEL IT IS MY DUTY

02:41.829 --> 02:45.799
TO WARN YOU ABOUT
THE PITFALLS OF SURROGACY.

02:45.866 --> 02:47.601
THAT WOMAN IS A TOXIC SPILL

02:47.668 --> 02:51.305
POLLUTING THE PRISTINE WATERS
OF YOUR FAMILIAL LOVE.

02:51.372 --> 02:52.706
(turns off faucet)
TRUST ME, JILL.

02:52.773 --> 02:54.775
I AM SPEAKING
FROM EXPERIENCE HERE.

02:54.842 --> 02:58.011
ONCE SHE PASSES THAT PLACENTA,
HER HORMONES WILL PLUMMET,

02:58.078 --> 02:59.213
AND SO WILL HER SANITY.

02:59.280 --> 03:00.348
HER SOLE FOCUS WILL BECOME

03:00.414 --> 03:03.284
STEALING YOUR HUSBAND,
YOUR BABY, OR BOTH.

03:03.351 --> 03:04.252
SHE'S PROBABLY FANTASIZING

03:04.318 --> 03:07.255
ABOUT PUSHING YOU DOWN
A FLIGHT OF STAIRS RIGHT NOW.

03:07.321 --> 03:09.657
ALWAYS A PLEASURE, SHEILA.

03:14.262 --> 03:16.830
(toilet flushes in distance)

03:16.897 --> 03:18.332
THANK YOU, DEAR.

03:20.334 --> 03:23.804

* DA-DA-DA-DA,

03:33.247 --> 03:35.349
IT'S SO CUTE,

03:35.416 --> 03:38.486
AND CHEF ALAN IS A CHEF,
SO IT'S PERFECT!

03:38.552 --> 03:40.421
OF COURSE IT'S PERFECT.

03:40.488 --> 03:42.055
IT'S AS IF
SOMEONE WITH CRYSTAL EYES

03:42.122 --> 03:43.023
LOOKED INTO YOUR HEART

03:43.090 --> 03:45.826
AND CRYSTALLIZED YOUR LOVE
FOR HIM.

03:45.893 --> 03:46.660
PRICEY, THOUGH.

03:46.727 --> 03:48.462
LOOK, IF YOU THINK
I'M GONNA PRESSURE YOU

03:48.529 --> 03:52.733
INTO BUYING THIS 35-POUND
CRYSTAL CHEF'S HAT, I'M NOT.

03:52.800 --> 03:53.834
YOU'RE NOT?

03:53.901 --> 03:55.202
OF COURSE NOT.

03:55.269 --> 03:58.439
THIS CRYSTAL WAS CLEARLY
MADE FOR CHEF ALAN.

03:58.506 --> 04:02.109
IF YOU DON'T BUY IT,
I'M SURE SOMEBODY ELSE WILL.

04:02.175 --> 04:03.311
IT WOULD BE A SHAME
FOR THAT OTHER PERSON

04:03.377 --> 04:04.912
TO SOAK UP
ALL THAT GLORY...

04:04.978 --> 04:06.280
I'LL TAKE IT!

04:06.347 --> 04:10.318
SOMEBODY'S GONNA GET
LUCKY TONIGHT.

04:10.384 --> 04:12.486
GIRL, YOU ARE AMAZING.

04:12.553 --> 04:14.555
NO ONE PUSHES CRYSTAL ROCK
LIKE YOU.

04:14.622 --> 04:17.458
I HAVE TO ADMIT,
IT'S A RUSH.

04:17.525 --> 04:19.693
I NEVER THOUGHT I'D BE GOOD
AT THIS SORT OF THING,

04:19.760 --> 04:23.897
AND I AM LOVING
MY NEW DISPOSABLE INCOME.

04:23.964 --> 04:26.334
LET ME TELL YOU,
AS A NEWLY INDEPENDENT WOMAN,

04:26.400 --> 04:28.101
EARNING YOUR OWN MONEY
IS LIKE

04:28.168 --> 04:30.070
ICING ON THE CAKE
OF LIBERATION!

04:30.137 --> 04:34.308
DALLAS, I THINK IT'S
REALLY AWESOME, WHAT YOU DID.

04:34.375 --> 04:36.109
INSTEAD OF GETTING DEPRESSED
ABOUT YOUR DIVORCE,

04:36.176 --> 04:38.245
YOU DECIDED
TO TRY SOMETHING NEW,

04:38.312 --> 04:41.248
AND... NOW LOOK.

04:41.315 --> 04:42.650
YOU'RE A HUGE SUCCESS.

WE'RE A HUGE SUCCESS.

THANKS, DALLAS.
IT'S AMAZING.

05:21.489 --> 05:22.456
YOU'RE AMAZING.

05:22.523 --> 05:25.526
I CAN SEE YOU FOLLOWING
IN MY FOOTSTEPS SOMEDAY.

05:25.593 --> 05:28.929
GEORGE MUST BE SO PROUD
OF HOW HARD YOU'RE WORKING.

05:28.996 --> 05:32.199
HONESTLY, I HAVEN'T SEEN
MUCH OF MY DAD LATELY.

05:32.265 --> 05:33.667
OH, NO?

05:33.734 --> 05:35.703
IN FACT,
GEORGE'S ROMANCE WITH EDEN...
HEY.

05:35.769 --> 05:37.638
HI.
WAS ENTERING
ITS SECOND TRIMESTER,

05:37.705 --> 05:39.873
AND I STILL HADN'T EVEN
MET THE WOMAN.

05:39.940 --> 05:41.409
YOU KNOW,
IF ALL THESE PEOPLE PLANTED

05:41.475 --> 05:42.676
VEGETABLES
INSTEAD OF GRASS,

05:42.743 --> 05:45.879
THEY COULD PUT A HUGE DENT
IN THE WORLD'S HUNGER CRISIS.

05:45.946 --> 05:48.516
YOU--THAT--THAT--THAT IS
WHAT I LOVE ABOUT YOU.

05:48.582 --> 05:49.883
I SEE A DUDE WATERING
HIS LAWN,

05:49.950 --> 05:53.821
AND YOU SEE AN OPPORTUNITY
TO HEAL THE WORLD.

05:53.887 --> 05:56.890
I CAN'T WAIT
FOR TESSA TO MEET YOU.

05:56.957 --> 05:58.258
OOH!
YOU ALL RIGHT?

05:58.325 --> 05:59.259
OH, MAN. (chuckles)

05:59.326 --> 06:00.327
THAT WAS A GOOD ONE.
YOU OKAY?

06:00.394 --> 06:01.795
OH.
YOU WANT TO FEEL
THE BABY KICK?

06:01.862 --> 06:04.998
OH. NO.
I SHOULDN'T FEEL ANYTHING.

06:05.065 --> 06:06.299
(clicks tongue)

06:06.366 --> 06:09.102
OH. WAS THAT...

06:09.169 --> 06:10.871
(laughs)

06:10.938 --> 06:13.140
COOL. YEAH. I FELT IT.

06:13.206 --> 06:16.076
YOU WANT
TO FEEL SOMETHING ELSE?

06:16.143 --> 06:17.044
BABY BONES!

06:17.110 --> 06:18.746
OH.

06:18.812 --> 06:19.613
WHAT?

06:19.680 --> 06:21.549
IS EVERYTHING OKAY, GEORGE?
MM-HMM.

06:21.615 --> 06:23.584
BECAUSE I FEEL LIKE
YOU PULL AWAY EVERY TIME I TRY

06:23.651 --> 06:24.852
TO GET INTIMATE WITH YOU.
WELL, YES,

06:24.918 --> 06:26.654
BUT THAT'S USUALLY ONLY
WHEN I HAVE TO GO NUMBER TWO.

06:30.724 --> 06:31.425
OH.

06:31.492 --> 06:32.893
(clears throat)

06:32.960 --> 06:34.695
THAT IS INTIMATE.

06:34.762 --> 06:38.532
LOOK, UNTIL YOU'VE BATHED
IN A SOLID CRYSTAL BATHTUB,

06:38.599 --> 06:39.967
YOU HAVEN'T BATHED AT ALL.

06:40.033 --> 06:40.668
HI. I--

06:40.734 --> 06:42.603
IT IS ONE OF THOSE
OVER-THE-TOP INDULGENCES

06:42.670 --> 06:46.440
THAT IS WORTH EVERY PENNY,
LIKE AN ARMORED VEHICLE.

06:46.507 --> 06:48.476
JUST... THINK ABOUT IT.

06:48.542 --> 06:51.178
I HAVE
OTHER CUSTOMERS WAITING.

06:51.244 --> 06:52.412
(sighs) YOU MUST BE--

06:52.480 --> 06:54.582
EDEN. HI.
TESSA ALTMAN--

06:54.648 --> 06:57.217
ULTIMATE SALES MANAGER
GRAND SUPREME.

06:57.284 --> 06:58.752
EDEN, DID YOU MEET...

06:58.819 --> 07:01.254
THE PERSON WHO USED TO BE
MY DAUGHTER? (chuckles)

07:01.321 --> 07:03.323
TESSA,
WHAT HAPPENED TO YOU?

07:03.390 --> 07:07.194
I GOT PROMOTED. SEE?

07:07.260 --> 07:09.897
OKAY. WOW. REALLY?

07:09.963 --> 07:11.932
MM-HMM.
IS THAT WHAT
ALL THESE BOXES ARE ABOUT?

07:11.999 --> 07:15.135
KIND OF. DALLAS SAID
I NEEDED TO STEP UP MY IMAGE

07:15.202 --> 07:16.970
IN ORDER TO INVITE SUCCESS.

07:17.037 --> 07:19.006
IF I SHOWED UP TO WORK
LOOKING LIKE YOU, GEORGE,

07:19.072 --> 07:21.408
PEOPLE WOULD THINK I WAS THERE
TO CLEAN THE FLOORS,

07:21.475 --> 07:24.177
WHICH I'M NOT... (chuckles)
EXCEPT FOR WHEN WE'RE CLOSED.

07:24.244 --> 07:26.013
WHOA.

07:26.079 --> 07:28.782
THIS PURSE COST MORE
THAN EVERY ARTICLE OF CLOTHING

07:28.849 --> 07:31.018
I HAVE EVER OWNED...
COMBINED.

07:31.084 --> 07:33.921
I GUESS, ECONOMICALLY,

07:33.987 --> 07:36.757
YOU AND I ARE
IN DIFFERENT PLACES, GEORGE.

07:36.824 --> 07:39.059
HMM.
IT WAS GREAT MEETING YOU.

07:39.126 --> 07:39.993
(Bluetooth rings)

07:40.060 --> 07:42.696
GO FOR TESSA.
YOU CHANGED YOUR MIND?

07:42.763 --> 07:45.365
NO, IT'S STILL AVAILABLE.
WE NEED A 10% DEPOSIT.

07:45.432 --> 07:46.567
I BRIEFLY TAKE MY EYE OFF
THE BALL,

07:46.634 --> 07:48.435
AND SHE TURNS
INTO IMELDA MARCOS.
(sighs)

07:48.502 --> 07:50.103
OH, SHE SEEMED GREAT.

07:50.170 --> 07:51.471
WHAT? SHE SEEMED AWFUL.

07:51.539 --> 07:52.973
THE HAIR AND THE NAILS
AND THE SHOPPING--

07:53.040 --> 07:54.307
THAT IS NOT TESSA.

07:54.374 --> 07:55.609
I WOULDN'T BE
TOO HARD ON HER.

07:55.676 --> 07:57.778
IT SOUNDS LIKE
HER FRIEND DALLAS

07:57.845 --> 07:59.513
IS THE ONE PUSHING HER
INTO THIS,

07:59.580 --> 08:00.848
AND THAT'S
HOW TEENAGERS ARE.

08:00.914 --> 08:03.250
OH, DALLAS IS
NO TEENAGER, THOUGH.

08:03.316 --> 08:04.585
NO,
SHE'S A FULL-GROWN WOMAN.

08:04.652 --> 08:05.886
(chuckles) FULL-GROWN!

08:05.953 --> 08:09.590
OH. WELL, IT'S VERY NORMAL
FOR GIRLS TO PATTERN THEMSELVES

08:09.657 --> 08:11.458
AFTER THE WOMEN
IN THEIR LIVES.

08:11.525 --> 08:13.961
SOUNDS LIKE DALLAS
IS HER PRIMARY INFLUENCE.

08:14.027 --> 08:16.930
WELL, THAT'S KINDA WHY
I WANTED HER TO MEET YOU.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.899
OHH.

08:21.434 --> 08:23.771
DERNK! (clears throat)

08:25.472 --> 08:26.707
(under breath) "DERNK"?

08:29.643 --> 08:34.014
"I'M SPEAKING
FROM EXPERIENCE"--

08:34.081 --> 08:37.117
THAT'S WHAT SHEILA SHAY SAID
WHEN I OVERHEARD HER TALKING

08:37.184 --> 08:37.951
IN THE BATHROOM,

08:38.018 --> 08:40.654
AND THAT SENTENCE JUST KEPT
GNAWING AT ME.

08:40.721 --> 08:41.789
I KNEW
THERE WAS SOMETHING TO IT.

08:41.855 --> 08:44.391
THERE HAD TO BE,
SO I WENT THROUGH EVERY BOX

08:44.457 --> 08:47.527
IN THE GARAGE,
UNTIL I FOUND THIS.

08:49.797 --> 08:51.464
"HOMELAND ADOPTION"?

08:51.531 --> 08:52.733
EXACTLY.

08:52.800 --> 08:53.867
UH, I DON'T GET IT.

08:53.934 --> 08:56.069
WHY IS THE WOMAN I CALL "MOTHER"
DRIVEN INTO HYSTERICS

08:56.136 --> 08:57.705
BECAUSE SOMEONE'S USING
A SURROGATE?

08:57.771 --> 08:58.739
(chuckles)
SHE'S DRIVEN INTO HYSTERICS

08:58.806 --> 09:00.908
OVER PEOPLE NOT PUTTING ROSEMARY
IN THEIR CHICKEN SALAD,

09:00.974 --> 09:02.843
WHICH IS ACTUALLY
REALLY GOOD. (chuckles)

09:02.910 --> 09:04.244
SHE'S FIXATED ON THE IDEA

09:04.311 --> 09:07.447
THAT SOMEONE CAN LAY CLAIM
TO SOMEONE ELSE'S BABY,

09:07.514 --> 09:08.816
AND WHY?

09:11.719 --> 09:14.354
BECAUSE I'M ADOPTED,

09:14.421 --> 09:15.355
AND AFTER ALL THESE YEARS,

09:15.422 --> 09:18.025
MY REAL MOTHER HAS BEEN
OUT THERE LOOKING FOR ME.

09:18.091 --> 09:19.993
SEEMS A LITTLE FAR-FETCHED,
IF YOU ASK ME.

09:20.060 --> 09:22.229
MY REAL MOTHER COULD BE
TORI AMOS.

09:22.295 --> 09:23.664
NO.

09:23.731 --> 09:25.332
EDIE BRICKELL.

09:25.398 --> 09:26.767
HAVE YOU SEEN
MY FART JOKE BOOK?

09:26.834 --> 09:28.201
I GOT A BIG PHONE CALL
COMING UP,

09:28.268 --> 09:30.137
AND I NEED TO MAKE A JOKE
ABOUT A FART.

09:30.203 --> 09:33.040
GET OUT OF MY ROOM.

09:37.811 --> 09:39.446
(knock on door)

09:39.512 --> 09:40.814
HEY. YOU GOT A SEC?

09:40.881 --> 09:41.749
SURE. WHAT'S UP?

09:41.815 --> 09:42.783
WELL, I FEEL LIKE
IT'S BEEN AGES

09:42.850 --> 09:44.584
SINCE WE HAD A CHANCE
TO TALK ONE-ON-ONE.

09:44.652 --> 09:46.519
CUT THE CUTICLES
OR JUST PUSH BACK?

09:46.586 --> 09:48.255
JUST PUSH BACK, PLEASE.
OKAY.

09:48.321 --> 09:52.159
COSTS MORE FOR THE HOME VISITS,
BUT IT IS WORTH IT.

09:52.225 --> 09:53.160
IBIZA'S EXCELLENT.

09:53.226 --> 09:55.562
THANK YOU.
YOU KNOW YOU'RE ALLOWED
TO SAVE MONEY, RIGHT?

09:55.629 --> 09:56.429
IT DOESN'T EXPIRE.

09:56.496 --> 10:01.669
IT'S FOR WORK. DALLAS SAYS,
"OUR NAILS ARE NOT JUST NAILS.

10:01.735 --> 10:03.837
THEY ARE
CRYSTAL DISPLAY STICKS."

10:03.904 --> 10:05.472
ARE YOU SURE
THAT WASN'T IMELDA MARCOS?

10:05.538 --> 10:06.206
I DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT MEANS.

10:06.273 --> 10:07.841
IT TURNS OUT
THERE'S A FELLINI FESTIVAL

10:07.908 --> 10:09.542
A COUPLE TOWNS OVER--
STARTS NEXT TUESDAY.

10:09.609 --> 10:10.878
I WAS THINKING
THE THREE OF US COULD GO.

10:10.944 --> 10:13.647
UH, I'M NOT SURE
IBIZA LIKES FELLINI.

10:13.714 --> 10:15.582
TOO QUIRKY FOR THE SAKE
OF BEING QUIRKY.

10:15.649 --> 10:16.784
I MEANT YOU, ME, AND EDEN.

10:16.850 --> 10:19.219
OH! (chuckles)
WHAT DAY WERE YOU THINKING?

10:19.286 --> 10:20.654
ANY DAY.
OHH.

10:20.721 --> 10:23.056
ANY DAY IS TOUGH FOR ME.
I WORK AFTER SCHOOL.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.124
WELL, COULDN'T YOU TAKE
A DAY OFF?

10:24.191 --> 10:25.659
IT'S BEEN FOREVER
SINCE YOU AND I HAVE SEEN

10:25.726 --> 10:26.727
A FELLINI MOVIE TOGETHER.

10:26.794 --> 10:28.428
OH, THAT IS GREAT, IBIZA.

10:28.495 --> 10:30.831
FLESHY NUDE? YEAH. THANKS.

10:30.898 --> 10:33.066
LOOK, I DON'T--I DON'T HAVE
MY CALENDAR WITH ME.

10:33.133 --> 10:36.003
HOW ABOUT YOU LEAVE ME
A VOICE MAIL WITH THE DETAILS?

10:36.069 --> 10:38.371
I SHOULD BE ABLE
TO MAKE JUNE WORK.
YEAH.

10:38.438 --> 10:40.573
JULY AT THE LATEST.

10:40.640 --> 10:43.143
TESSA IS DOING
SUCH AN AMAZING JOB.

10:43.210 --> 10:44.611
I JUST WISH
SOME OF HER WORK ETHIC

10:44.678 --> 10:46.780
WOULD RUB OFF ON DALIA.

10:46.847 --> 10:48.248
UH, OH, WELL... (chuckles)

10:48.315 --> 10:50.383
THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT I WANTED
TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT.

10:50.450 --> 10:52.585
SEE, I'M WORRIED TESSA MAY BE
WORKING TOO HARD.

10:52.652 --> 10:54.021
(gasps) OH, MY GOSH.

10:54.087 --> 10:55.889
HAS SHE FALLEN BEHIND
ON HER STUDIES?

10:55.956 --> 10:57.791
NO.
DOES SHE SEEM
PHYSICALLY STRESSED

10:57.858 --> 10:59.326
OR MENTALLY EXHAUSTED?

10:59.392 --> 11:00.861
WELL, NO, NOT REALLY.

11:00.928 --> 11:02.262
I JUST THINK
TESSA IS GETTING

11:02.329 --> 11:05.999
A LITTLE WRAPPED UP
IN THE WHOLE CRYSTAL BUSINESS.

11:06.066 --> 11:08.201
WELL, YES,
SHE MOST CERTAINLY IS.

11:08.268 --> 11:10.203
SHE'S
A LITTLE CRYSTAL SUPERSTAR.

11:10.270 --> 11:11.872
YEAH, BUT I FEEL LIKE
SHE'S MISSING OUT

11:11.939 --> 11:13.941
ON THE OPPORTUNITY
TO CARE ABOUT THINGS THAT

11:14.007 --> 11:17.577
AREN'T MADE OF CRYSTAL...
(chuckles)

11:17.644 --> 11:18.812
AND TO GET TO KNOW EDEN.

11:18.879 --> 11:21.815
(gasps) EDEN. I SEE.

11:21.882 --> 11:24.051
WELL, GEORGE, THIS MAY BE
NONE OF MY BEESWAX,

11:24.117 --> 11:25.618
BUT I'M GONNA SHARE
A LITTLE ADVICE

11:25.685 --> 11:27.821
THAT DALIA'S SHRINK
GAVE ME--

11:27.888 --> 11:29.757
"LOVERS COME AND GO,
SO IT'S BEST NOT

11:29.823 --> 11:30.958
"TO BRING 'EM
AROUND YOUR KINDER

11:31.024 --> 11:33.693
UNTIL YOU'RE KINDA SURE
YOU'RE KINDRED."

11:34.728 --> 11:35.796
WELL, THAT'S THE THING,
DALLAS.

11:35.863 --> 11:39.432
I-I THINK
EDEN AND I MAY BE KINDRED.

11:39.499 --> 11:42.435
I MEAN, I HOPE WE ARE.

11:45.072 --> 11:46.706
WOW.

11:46.774 --> 11:49.142
I DIDN'T REALIZE
YOU TWO WERE SO SERIOUS.

11:50.878 --> 11:53.380
WELL, THAT'S TERRIFIC,
GEORGE.

11:53.446 --> 11:55.148
SO... YOU'LL HELP?

11:55.215 --> 11:56.950
WELL, OF COURSE I WILL.
(chuckles)

11:57.017 --> 11:59.286
I WOULDN'T WANT MY BUSINESS
STANDING IN THE WAY

11:59.352 --> 12:00.754
OF YOUR BLISSNESS.

12:00.821 --> 12:05.525
(chuckles) RIGHT.
WELL, THANK YOU, DALLAS.

12:05.592 --> 12:07.995
MOMMY, YOUR Wi-Fi SUCKS.

12:08.061 --> 12:10.297
I KNOW IT DOES, HONEY.

12:26.046 --> 12:28.148
WHAT ARE YOU LOOKING FOR?

12:28.215 --> 12:29.817
FAMILY SECRETS.

12:29.883 --> 12:32.185
THEY KEEP THOSE
IN THE POTTING SHED.

12:35.655 --> 12:39.326
(door creaking)

12:39.793 --> 12:42.395
(creaks)

12:50.403 --> 12:52.772
(creaks)

13:05.285 --> 13:06.519
GOTCHA.

13:09.056 --> 13:10.623
I FEEL
SO MUCH MORE COMFORTABLE

13:10.690 --> 13:11.992
HAVING
MY PREGNANCY PORTRAIT DONE

13:12.059 --> 13:14.294
NOW THAT
I'M NOT ACTUALLY PREGNANT.

13:14.361 --> 13:16.696
MY PREGNANCY PORTRAIT
FROM LAST TIME LOOKED SO--

13:16.763 --> 13:20.167
FAT. YEAH. NO, I SEE IT.

13:20.233 --> 13:22.102
NO, TH-THIS PREGNANCY HAS
BEEN KIND TO YOU.

13:22.169 --> 13:24.537
I GOTTA SAY THAT.
YOU LOOK FABULOUS.

13:24.604 --> 13:26.306
I FEEL SENSATIONAL.

13:28.108 --> 13:29.943
THANKS AGAIN, MRS. SHAY,

13:30.010 --> 13:31.879
FOR INSISTING ON CARRYING
MY PRODUCE.

13:31.945 --> 13:34.514
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT THEY SAY
ABOUT LIFTING THINGS

13:34.581 --> 13:36.283
WHEN YOU'RE PREGNANT--
DON'T. (laughs)

13:36.349 --> 13:38.018
(chuckles)
(Noah) EDEN'S HOME!

13:38.085 --> 13:40.420
(claps hands)
JUST IN TIME.

13:40.487 --> 13:41.688
(chuckles)

13:41.754 --> 13:44.091
THAT WAS
AN AWFULLY WARM WELCOME.

13:44.157 --> 13:46.426
DO YOU WANT MY BELLY
IN THE PORTRAIT?

13:46.493 --> 13:47.760
NO! NO. NO, NO, NO.

13:47.827 --> 13:50.430
(chuckles) I WANT TO WORK ON
SOME EARLY LANGUAGE TECHNIQUES

13:50.497 --> 13:52.065
WITH THE FETUS.
(raised voice) HELLO, FETUS!

13:52.132 --> 13:53.766
(normal voice)
IT'S DR. NOAH WERNER...
OHH.

13:53.833 --> 13:54.935
A.K.A. YOUR DAD.

13:55.002 --> 13:56.036
WHOA. (chuckles)

13:56.103 --> 13:57.370
UH, IF YOU'VE BEEN PAYING
ATTENTION IN THERE,

13:57.437 --> 14:00.407
YOU KNOW THAT CHINA IS
THE LARGEST HOLDER OF U.S. DEBT,

14:00.473 --> 14:03.576
SO I THINK IT'S PRUDENT THAT
YOU LEARN A LITTLE MANDARIN.

14:03.643 --> 14:04.912
(raised voice) "NI HAO"!

14:04.978 --> 14:07.247
NOAH, YOUR BABY DOESN'T
EVEN HAVE EYELASHES YET.

14:07.314 --> 14:09.249
I DON'T THINK
IT'S GONNA LEARN CHINESE.

14:09.316 --> 14:10.683
IF YOU REALLY WANTED
TO BE HELPFUL,

14:10.750 --> 14:11.919
YOU'D GIVE ME
A FOOT MASSAGE.

14:11.985 --> 14:14.621
CARRYING YOUR BABY AROUND
IS KILLER ON THE ARCHES.

14:14.687 --> 14:15.522
REALLY? I'M SURPRISED.

14:15.588 --> 14:17.958
THOSE LESBIAN CLOGS LOOK
COMFORTABLE, IF NOTHING ELSE.

14:18.025 --> 14:20.660
SO, EDEN, HOW ARE THINGS
GOING WITH GEORGE ALTMAN?

14:20.727 --> 14:23.330
GOOD, I THINK. HE GOT TO FEEL
THE BABY KICK THE OTHER DAY.

14:23.396 --> 14:25.732
(strained voice) HE DID?
THAT'S... (chuckles)

14:25.798 --> 14:26.733
OHH.

14:26.799 --> 14:28.201
(Eden) THAT'S GREAT, NOAH.
MY.

14:28.268 --> 14:30.971
SEEMS YOUR HUSBAND HAS NEARLY
BROUGHT HER TO ECSTASY.

14:31.038 --> 14:32.973
I DON'T KNOW IF I'D SAY THAT,

14:33.040 --> 14:35.842
BUT IT IS
A DARN GOOD FOOT MASSAGE.

14:35.909 --> 14:37.110
I GOTTA SCOOT, THOUGH.

14:37.177 --> 14:38.845
GEORGE AND I ARE TAKING
TESSA TO A MOVIE.

14:38.912 --> 14:40.948
NO. NO, NO, NO.
NOT TODAY YOU'RE NOT.

14:41.014 --> 14:42.815
UH, WE HAVE
THE ULTRASOUND SCHEDULED.

14:42.882 --> 14:43.951
THAT'S NOT TILL NEXT WEEK.

14:44.017 --> 14:44.684
WE MOVED IT UP.

14:44.751 --> 14:46.753
OUR NUMEROLOGIST NEEDS
TO KNOW THE SEX OF THE BABY

14:46.819 --> 14:48.155
SO HE CAN GET STARTED
ON NAMES.

14:48.221 --> 14:50.657
I WISH
YOU WOULD HAVE TOLD ME.

14:50.723 --> 14:53.726
I'M TELLING YOU NOW.

14:53.793 --> 14:54.894
OH.

14:54.962 --> 14:56.196
NEXT TIME, GEORGE,
I'D APPRECIATE IT

14:56.263 --> 14:57.931
IF YOU LET ME SCHEDULE
MY OWN DAYS OFF.

14:57.998 --> 14:59.532
WELL, FELLINI WAITS
FOR NO MAN.

14:59.599 --> 15:00.400
TRUST ME, TESSA.

15:00.467 --> 15:02.435
THIS IS GONNA BE FUN.
(cell phone rings)

15:02.502 --> 15:04.271
HEY, EDEN.
WE'RE ALMOST THERE.

15:04.337 --> 15:06.306
I'M SORRY. I CAN'T GO.

15:06.373 --> 15:08.775
Jill moved the ultrasound
without telling me.

15:08.841 --> 15:10.243
(Jill) I'm telling you now!

15:10.310 --> 15:11.945
BUMMER. WELL, I-I GUESS--

15:12.012 --> 15:13.446
I GUESS THEY CAN'T DO THAT
WITHOUT YOU, HUH?

15:13.513 --> 15:15.348
(chuckles) Believe me,
I wish they could.

15:15.415 --> 15:17.450
(lowered voice) George,
they're acting really weird.

15:17.517 --> 15:18.418
Jill's all uptight,

15:18.485 --> 15:20.220
and I don't even know
what's going on with Noah.

15:20.287 --> 15:22.855
Every time I mention
your name, he tweaks out.

15:22.922 --> 15:24.191
(Noah) Is that George?!

15:24.257 --> 15:25.258
OKAY, OK--
YOU KNOW WHAT?

15:25.325 --> 15:28.695
MAYBE TESSA AND I SHOULD COME
WITH YOU FOR MORAL SUPPORT.

15:28.761 --> 15:31.131
REALLY?
YOU GUYS WOULD DO THAT?

15:31.198 --> 15:35.135
OF COURSE. YEAH, YEAH, YEAH.
W-WE'LL SEE YOU THERE.

15:35.202 --> 15:37.537
NOW I'M JUST MISSING WORK
TO GO WATCH YOUR GIRLFRIEND

15:37.604 --> 15:38.471
GET HER BABY CHECKED?

15:38.538 --> 15:39.839
IT'LL BE BETTER
THAN FELLINI.

15:39.906 --> 15:42.375
IT'LL BE FELLINIESQUE.
(chuckles)

15:43.643 --> 15:46.113
HELLO.
WE'RE FRED AND SHEILA SHAY,

15:46.179 --> 15:48.948
AND WE WOULD LOVE TO WELCOME
ANOTHER SPECIAL LIFE...

15:49.016 --> 15:49.916
(voice breaks)
INTO OUR HOME.

15:49.983 --> 15:51.451
(under breath)
KEEP IT TOGETHER, FRED.

15:51.518 --> 15:53.553
(normal voice)
WE LOVE TO TRAVEL.

15:53.620 --> 15:56.023
UH, YEAH, WE JUST WENT...
(voice breaks) TO COSTA RICA.

15:56.089 --> 15:57.757
WE LOVE WATERSKIING,

15:57.824 --> 16:01.128
UM, AND WE HAVE A CHR--
A STRONG CHRISTIAN FAITH.

16:01.194 --> 16:03.430
UH, WE'VE GOT
SO MUCH LOVE TO GIVE.

16:03.496 --> 16:06.099
YEAH. (voice breaking)
SO MANY BLESSINGS TO SHARE.

16:06.166 --> 16:07.800
WON'T YOU PLEASE
CONSIDER US?

16:07.867 --> 16:09.302
OHH.
NOW YOU'VE GOT ME GOING.

16:09.369 --> 16:10.437
(chuckles)

16:10.503 --> 16:11.371
(Lisa) DISGUSTING.

16:11.438 --> 16:12.939
OKAY, IT'S WEIRD.
I'LL GIVE YOU THAT,

16:13.006 --> 16:14.207
BUT IT'S INCONCLUSIVE.

16:14.274 --> 16:17.610
MALIK, THEY TRICKED
SOME POOR ACOUSTIC SONGSTRESS

16:17.677 --> 16:21.381
WITH NATURALLY CURLY HAIR
INTO GIVING ME UP...

16:21.448 --> 16:22.782
WITH LIES.

16:22.849 --> 16:23.916
THEY DON'T WATER-SKI.

16:23.983 --> 16:25.252
LISA,
EVEN IF YOU ARE ADOPTED,

16:25.318 --> 16:26.719
HOW IS THAT GONNA CHANGE
ANYTHING?

16:26.786 --> 16:28.421
YOU'RE A SHAY NOW.
THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS.

16:28.488 --> 16:30.190
(scoffs) THAT IS NOT
ALL THAT MATTERS.

16:30.257 --> 16:32.292
IF I'M NOT BIOLOGICALLY
RELATED TO MY FAMILY,

16:32.359 --> 16:33.626
THEN THERE'S STILL HOPE.

16:33.693 --> 16:35.962
I CAN GROW UP TO BE ANYONE.

16:36.029 --> 16:38.998
HEY. AREN'T WE GONNA
MAKE OUT?

16:39.066 --> 16:41.501
MALIK, I'M OBVIOUSLY GOING
THROUGH SOME STUFF RIGHT NOW.

16:41.568 --> 16:44.271
JUST HANDLE
YOUR OWN BUSINESS, OKAY?

16:47.907 --> 16:48.741
(siren wailing in distance)

16:48.808 --> 16:50.410
WOW. I'VE NEVER HAD AN AUDIENCE
THIS BIG BEFORE. (chuckles)

16:50.477 --> 16:52.112
WELL, SOME OF US ARE HAVING
A HARD TIME RESPECTING

16:52.179 --> 16:53.213
OTHER PEOPLE'S BOUNDARIES.

16:53.280 --> 16:54.714
I COULDN'T AGREE MORE.

16:54.781 --> 16:57.050
OH, THAT--THAT IS HILARIOUS,
COMING FROM YOU.

16:57.117 --> 16:58.151
WHAT IS THAT SUPPOSED TO MEAN?

16:58.218 --> 16:59.419
YOU KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT IT'S SUPPOSED TO MEAN.

16:59.486 --> 17:01.121
TESSA, IF YOU KEEP LOOKING
AT THE MONITOR,

17:01.188 --> 17:02.289
YOU'LL SEE THE BABY
IN A MINUTE.

17:02.355 --> 17:03.590
WOULD SOMEONE LIKE
TO SPREAD THE JELLY?

17:03.656 --> 17:05.125
OH, I'LL DO IT.
I'LL DO IT.

17:05.192 --> 17:06.359
HE WANTS
TO TOUCH HER BARE TUMMY.

17:06.426 --> 17:07.660
NOAH, DON'T TOUCH
HER BARE TUMMY.

17:07.727 --> 17:10.263
WHY DOES HE GET TO DO IT?
IT'S MY BABY IN THERE.

17:10.330 --> 17:12.299
IT'S FINE. I-I'D BE HAPPY
TO DO IT MYSELF.

17:12.365 --> 17:15.168
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

17:15.235 --> 17:16.236
(whispers) SORRY.

17:16.303 --> 17:17.637
(squirts)
(inhales sharply)

17:17.704 --> 17:18.338
IS THAT COLD?

17:18.405 --> 17:20.240
(George and Eden chuckle)

17:20.307 --> 17:23.143
CAN YOU TALK A LITTLE BIT ABOUT
THE ADVANTAGE OF MAINTAINING

17:23.210 --> 17:25.545
A HEALTHY SEX LIFE
DURING PREGNANCY?

17:25.612 --> 17:27.980
I THINK IT MIGHT PUT
SOMEONE'S MIND AT EASE.

17:28.047 --> 17:30.083
MY MIND? IS SHE TALKING
ABOUT MY MIND?

17:30.150 --> 17:32.385
I DOUBT SHE'S TALKING
ABOUT YOUR MIND, NOAH.

17:32.452 --> 17:34.154
I'M TALKING ABOUT
GEORGE'S MIND. (chuckles)

17:34.221 --> 17:36.089
THAT'S WHAT THE "DERNK"
WAS ABOUT, WASN'T IT?

17:36.156 --> 17:37.557
SWEETHEART, UH, CAN WE
TALK ABOUT THIS LATER?

17:37.624 --> 17:39.092
THERE WAS A DERNK?
YOU DERNKED HER?

17:39.159 --> 17:40.627
ANYONE WANT ANYTHING
FROM THE VENDING MACHINE?

17:40.693 --> 17:41.861
OH, I'LL TAKE
A GUMMY ANYTHING.

17:41.928 --> 17:43.530
I'M GONNA GET SOMETHING
REALLY LOUD AND CRUNCHY

17:43.596 --> 17:44.997
SO I CAN'T HEAR MYSELF THINK.

17:45.064 --> 17:46.333
A LOT OF FATHERS
ARE CONCERNED

17:46.399 --> 17:47.667
ABOUT SEX
DURING PREGNANCY...

17:47.734 --> 17:49.202
OH, NO. I'M NOT--I'M NOT--
I'M NOT CONCERNED.

17:49.269 --> 17:50.470
HE'S NOT THE FATHER!

17:50.537 --> 17:53.506
BUT, TRUTHFULLY,
IT'S FANTASTIC FOR THE BABY.

17:53.573 --> 17:55.275
IT STRENGTHENS
THE PELVIC FLOOR,

17:55.342 --> 17:57.144
INCREASES BLOOD FLOW
TO THE UTERUS,

17:57.210 --> 17:59.045
AND AT THE HEIGHT
OF THE SEXUAL RESPONSE CYCLE,

17:59.112 --> 18:00.513
IT'S LIKE
A FUN LITTLE ROLLER COASTER RIDE

18:00.580 --> 18:02.682
FOR THE BABY.
I WOULDN'T PUT MY BABY
ON A ROLLER COASTER.

18:02.749 --> 18:05.218
WHY ARE YOU HERE?
SHE'S RIGHT.
I DON'T WANT MY BABY

18:05.285 --> 18:06.653
ON A ROLLER COASTER.
IT'S DANGEROUS.

18:06.719 --> 18:08.688
YOUR BABY HAS NOT BEEN
ON A ROLLER COASTER, OKAY?

18:08.755 --> 18:10.590
HE'D BETTER NOT HAVE BEEN,
BECAUSE WE HAVE A CONTRACT...
(sighs)

18:10.657 --> 18:12.725
AND IF THERE IS A BREACH...
THE BABY'S NOT IN BREECH.

18:12.792 --> 18:13.626
I WILL TAKE YOUR CAR!

18:13.693 --> 18:15.462
A CONTRACT?
WHAT'S HE TALKING ABOUT?

18:15.528 --> 18:17.197
I DON'T LIKE THE WAY
YOU'RE BEHAVING, NOAH.

18:17.264 --> 18:18.898
IT'S LIKE HE'S OBSESSED
WITH EDEN.

18:18.965 --> 18:20.200
WHY ARE YOU HERE?

18:20.267 --> 18:22.969
THIS CONTRACT WAS NOT MY IDEA.

18:23.035 --> 18:25.205
SO THAT'S WHY YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE INTIMATE WITH ME,

18:25.272 --> 18:27.674
BECAUSE YOU HAVE
A CONTRACT WITH NOAH?

18:27.740 --> 18:28.475
WHO DOES THAT?!

18:28.541 --> 18:29.609
EXCUSE ME. I-I DON'T MEAN
TO INTERRUPT,

18:29.676 --> 18:32.179
BUT I THINK ALL THE FIGHTING
IS STRESSING OUT THE BABY.

18:32.245 --> 18:33.413
I'M NOT SURE
IF YOU GUYS CAN TELL,

18:33.480 --> 18:35.415
BUT HE'S COVERING
HIS LITTLE EARS.

18:35.482 --> 18:36.216
(George, Sheila, Jill, and Noah)
OH.

18:36.283 --> 18:38.485
(whispers) OHH.

18:42.222 --> 18:45.158
THIS IS INSANE.
A CRAZY PERSON WROTE THIS.

18:45.225 --> 18:47.427
I KNOW. I KNOW,
BUT WHEN NOAH WANTS SOMETHING,

18:47.494 --> 18:48.595
HE CAN BE VERY INTENSE.

18:48.661 --> 18:50.630
(chuckles) YEAH.
I'VE SEEN THAT FIRSTHAND.

18:50.697 --> 18:52.332
I WAS JUST--I WAS TRYING
TO PRESERVE OUR FRIENDSHIP,

18:52.399 --> 18:53.966
BUT AFTER TODAY,
I DON'T CARE.

18:54.033 --> 18:57.003
ALL I CARE ABOUT
IS BEING WITH YOU.

18:57.069 --> 18:59.639
GEORGE, I CAN'T LIVE
LIKE THIS.

18:59.706 --> 19:03.476
THAT ULTRASOUND IMAGE
WILL HAUNT ME FOREVER.

19:03.543 --> 19:05.578
MY ONLY JOB IS TO MAKE SURE

19:05.645 --> 19:08.315
THAT THIS BABY HAS
A HEALTHY AND HAPPY GESTATION,

19:08.381 --> 19:11.083
AND... I FAILED.

19:11.150 --> 19:12.819
YOU DIDN'T FAIL.

19:12.885 --> 19:15.822
NO, I-I MEAN, IT'S NOT ME.

19:15.888 --> 19:17.457
IT'S THEM.

19:17.524 --> 19:21.661
I CAN'T STAY HERE,
NOT AFTER WHAT I SAW TODAY.

19:21.728 --> 19:25.365
THIS HOUSE IS TOXIC,
AND FOR THE GOOD OF THE BABY

19:25.432 --> 19:27.467
AND MY OWN SANITY,

19:27.534 --> 19:29.669
I'VE GOTTA GO BACK
TO MONTANA.

19:31.738 --> 19:33.240
EDEN, I'M SORRY,

19:33.306 --> 19:36.476
BUT I CAN'T LET
THAT HAPPEN.

19:38.778 --> 19:39.712
BUT I LIKE WORKING HERE,

19:39.779 --> 19:41.848
AND I LIKE SPENDING TIME
WITH YOU.
(whispers) OHH.

19:41.914 --> 19:43.716
(normal voice) I LIKE SPENDING
TIME WITH YOU, TOO,

19:43.783 --> 19:46.719
BUT IT'LL BE PART-TIME,
NOT FULL-TIME.

19:46.786 --> 19:49.088
TESSA, NOTHING'S
MORE IMPORTANT THAN FAMILY,

19:49.155 --> 19:51.558
AND YOU HAVE TO MAKE TIME
FOR YOURS,

19:51.624 --> 19:53.125
AND FROM THE SOUND
OF THINGS,

19:53.192 --> 19:55.495
THAT MIGHT INCLUDE
EDEN NOW, TOO.

19:55.562 --> 19:57.897
DAD CAN'T DICTATE
WHO MY FAMILY IS.

19:57.964 --> 20:00.800
I'M HAPPY FOR HIM AND ALL,
BUT I HARDLY KNOW EDEN.

20:00.867 --> 20:01.568
SHE'S JUST A--

20:01.634 --> 20:03.803
PREGNANT VAGABOND?
(whispers) OHH.

20:03.870 --> 20:07.006
(normal voice) TOLD MYSELF
I WASN'T GONNA SAY THAT.

20:07.073 --> 20:08.875
(water runs, faucet turns off)

20:08.941 --> 20:10.677
(door closes)

20:10.743 --> 20:13.145
WELL, DALLAS OFFICIALLY CUT
MY HOURS BACK.

20:13.212 --> 20:15.114
HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY.

20:15.181 --> 20:16.215
I'M NOT.

20:16.283 --> 20:17.817
I-I-I WENT ABOUT IT
THE WRONG WAY,

20:17.884 --> 20:18.918
AND I'M SORRY, TESSA,

20:18.985 --> 20:21.020
BUT I DIDN'T LIKE WHAT
THAT MONEY WAS DOING TO YOU,

20:21.087 --> 20:24.591
AND--AND I WANT US TO HAVE
MORE FAMILY TIME AT HOME.

20:24.657 --> 20:25.925
YEAH?

20:25.992 --> 20:28.861
I REALLY, REALLY HOPE
THE MOTIVATION BEHIND THIS

20:28.928 --> 20:30.630
ISN'T FORCING ME TO HANG OUT
WITH YOUR PREGNANT GIRLFRIEND,

20:30.697 --> 20:33.065
'CAUSE... (scoffs)
THAT'S NOT GONNA HAPPEN.

20:33.132 --> 20:35.268
(doorbell rings)

20:35.335 --> 20:38.338
(sighs)

20:38.405 --> 20:41.040
WELL, THAT'S THE THING,
TESSA.

20:41.107 --> 20:43.276
IT KINDA IS.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.914
NO, I--
I GOT IT. I GOT IT.
I GOT IT.

20:47.980 --> 20:49.449
YOU GOT IT?
YEAH. (chuckles)

20:49.516 --> 20:50.650
(chuckles)
HERE WE GO.

20:50.717 --> 20:51.784
OH. HI.

20:51.851 --> 20:52.985
(George)
IT'S JUST TEMPORARY.

20:53.052 --> 20:55.522
WE'RE NOT "OFFICIALLY"
MOVING IN TOGETHER.

20:55.588 --> 20:59.091
I WANTED TO DISCUSS IT WITH YOU,
BUT THERE JUST WASN'T TIME.

20:59.158 --> 21:01.027
COME ON, TESSA.
DON'T BE MAD.

21:01.093 --> 21:03.630
THE PARENT-CHILD RELATIONSHIP
IS A STRANGE ONE.

21:03.696 --> 21:05.264
YOU GROW UP
THINKING THEY'RE SUPERHEROES

21:05.332 --> 21:07.066
WHO CAN DO NO WRONG,

21:07.133 --> 21:09.402
BUT THEN ONE DAY
THE CAPE COMES OFF

21:09.469 --> 21:11.404
AND YOU SEE THEM
FOR WHO THEY REALLY ARE,

21:11.471 --> 21:13.005
AND IF YOU DON'T LIKE
WHAT YOU SEE...

21:13.072 --> 21:14.374
(snoring)

21:14.441 --> 21:15.508
TOUGH LUCK.

21:15.575 --> 21:17.209
YOU'RE STUCK TOGETHER.

21:17.276 --> 21:22.081
WHY? BECAUSE YOU'RE FAMILY.

21:22.148 --> 21:24.317
UNLESS, OF COURSE...

21:26.753 --> 21:28.688
YOU'RE NOT.

21:30.623 --> 21:32.492
(door creaks and closes)
