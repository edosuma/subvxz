01:52.720 --> 01:54.500
What's his name?

01:44.320 --> 01:47.205
- Bear.
- Are you looking after him?

01:48.680 --> 01:50.723
Make sure he doesn't get scared.

01:52.720 --> 01:54.500
I don't know how you do it.

01:54.600 --> 01:58.282
Night after night of this...
and you're still smiling.

01:59.400 --> 02:01.409
You've got to, haven't you?

03:30.600 --> 03:32.860
Now don't take it off
yourself again, all right?

03:32.960 --> 03:35.260
Good morning, headmistress.
Good morning, children.

03:35.360 --> 03:38.860
- Good morning, Miss Parkins.
- You're late.

03:38.960 --> 03:42.004
Sorry. My road was bombed last night.

03:43.760 --> 03:46.660
Shall we get on the train?

03:46.760 --> 03:50.180
- We're waiting on Edward Lee.
- Oh. I thought he was staying.

03:50.280 --> 03:52.209
Their house was hit.

03:53.640 --> 03:54.841
He's an orphan now.

03:58.160 --> 03:59.691
Here he is.

04:07.320 --> 04:09.860
- Morning.
- Good morning.

04:09.960 --> 04:11.740
Thank you for bringing him
to the station.

04:11.840 --> 04:13.724
It's the least we could do.

04:17.240 --> 04:19.899
Oh, Edward, I'm so, so sorry.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.420
You're gonna come with us now,
away from all this.

04:23.520 --> 04:25.165
He's not said a word since...

04:29.120 --> 04:30.860
- Right, that's it.
- Safe trip.

04:30.960 --> 04:33.500
- Thank you.
- Whistle's blown. Everybody on board.

04:33.600 --> 04:34.700
Thank you, sir.

04:34.800 --> 04:36.980
Right, come along.

04:37.080 --> 04:38.420
Now, stop dawdling.

04:38.520 --> 04:41.460
And stop fiddling with your tag.

04:46.460 --> 04:47.660
Thank you.

05:00.880 --> 05:02.969
Feet off the seats, Alfie.

05:39.760 --> 05:41.803
You must have started young.

05:42.640 --> 05:45.161
- Excuse me?
- To have four children.

05:47.058 --> 05:48.639
They're not mine.

05:48.739 --> 05:50.460
So you've kidnapped them, have you?

05:50.560 --> 05:51.860
They're evacuees.

05:51.960 --> 05:53.940
Their parents can't leave London.

05:54.040 --> 05:57.084
They have no other relatives, so we're
taking them to a house in the country.

05:57.760 --> 05:59.620
So where are you headed?

05:59.720 --> 06:04.380
If I'm being interrogated,
you could at least tell me your name.

06:04.480 --> 06:07.340
I'm Flying Officer Burnstow,
but you can call me Harry.

06:07.440 --> 06:09.260
I'm Eve.

06:09.360 --> 06:11.500
But you can call me Miss Parkins.

06:11.600 --> 06:13.540
Well, I'm very pleased
to meet you, Miss Parkins.

06:13.640 --> 06:14.841
I'm sure you are.

06:16.560 --> 06:18.700
We're heading to Crythin Gifford.

06:18.800 --> 06:20.540
Really? Me too.

06:20.640 --> 06:24.120
Really? And what
are you going to do there?

06:25.225 --> 06:27.060
I'm a pilot.

06:27.160 --> 06:29.203
That's what they all say.

06:31.640 --> 06:34.889
Sorry. I didn't mean to...

06:35.480 --> 06:36.886
It's fine.

07:02.680 --> 07:04.660
Yep. All right.

07:04.760 --> 07:07.486
- Thank you.
- Full of character.

07:09.840 --> 07:12.860
Come on, up you get.

07:12.960 --> 07:15.620
Mrs. Hogg, Dr. Rhodes,
Board of Education.

07:15.720 --> 07:17.300
I do apologize for keeping you.

07:17.400 --> 07:18.780
Oh, don't worry, don't worry.

07:18.880 --> 07:20.580
- Terrible mix up.
- Thank you.

07:20.680 --> 07:22.820
It was nice to meet you, Miss Parkins.
I'll visit when I can.

07:22.920 --> 07:25.860
- Please, call me Eve.
- Come along.

07:25.960 --> 07:29.846
We've kept Dr. Rhodes waiting
long enough already. Good night.

07:49.880 --> 07:51.605
- What was that?
- Damn.

08:09.080 --> 08:13.126
- Everybody stay close by.
- Where is everybody?

08:14.560 --> 08:17.035
- There's a spare in the back.
- I'll give you a hand.

08:21.080 --> 08:23.060
- What is that?
- Why is it staring at us?

08:23.160 --> 08:24.460
It's stuck.

08:29.920 --> 08:31.300
Oh, dear.

08:46.520 --> 08:48.340
Stay by the bus.

08:48.440 --> 08:51.405
- Joyce, look after everyone.
- Just leave it there.

09:03.320 --> 09:05.568
Hello?

09:08.640 --> 09:10.604
Hello?

09:31.400 --> 09:33.602
Hello?

09:48.200 --> 09:51.020
Died on Sunday, seen on Monday.

09:51.120 --> 09:53.420
- Who will be next? It must be you.
- Are you all right?

09:53.520 --> 09:55.860
Died on Sunday, seen on Monday.

09:55.960 --> 09:58.100
Who will die next? It must be you.

09:58.200 --> 10:03.060
- Don't look. You... You mustn't look.
- Sorry. It's all right.

10:04.560 --> 10:07.580
You mustn't look. Don't look.
You mustn't look.

10:12.320 --> 10:13.760
Sorry.

10:28.240 --> 10:31.205
The mist can roll in
quickly on these marshes.

10:34.560 --> 10:36.820
Can't you put the headlights on full?

10:36.920 --> 10:39.202
Blackout rules still apply here.

10:40.440 --> 10:41.900
But we could come off the road.

10:42.000 --> 10:45.060
We could also be underneath
a German bomber.

10:45.160 --> 10:46.940
If they haven't used
all their bombs on the cities,

10:47.040 --> 10:48.730
they drop 'em on the way back.

11:06.240 --> 11:08.140
Does anybody else live on the island?

11:08.240 --> 11:12.001
No, it's barren. The place
has been deserted for years.

11:23.920 --> 11:26.691
There it is, Eel Marsh House.

12:19.000 --> 12:21.202
Children's quarters.

12:40.200 --> 12:43.860
- Where are the others?
- Others?

12:43.960 --> 12:47.500
Yes, the others.
The other school parties.

12:47.600 --> 12:50.580
They don't arrive until next week.
You're the first.

12:50.680 --> 12:53.900
- Do you expect us to live like this?
- It's perfectly serviceable.

12:54.000 --> 12:56.220
It's derelict is what it is, Dr. Rhodes.

12:56.320 --> 12:58.940
My husband is a brigadier in the army,

12:59.040 --> 13:01.260
and he wouldn't let his men
stay in a place like this,

13:01.360 --> 13:02.580
let alone a group of schoolchildren.

13:02.680 --> 13:04.420
Granted, it hasn't been lived
in for a while,

13:04.520 --> 13:05.820
but the place will soon
come back to life.

13:05.920 --> 13:07.300
It's not good enough, Dr. Rhodes.

13:07.400 --> 13:10.540
It's all we have, Mrs. Hogg.

13:10.640 --> 13:13.180
Come on, children. Let's unpack.

13:13.280 --> 13:15.740
- Can't we look around?
- Let's unpack first.

13:15.840 --> 13:17.420
But...

13:17.520 --> 13:20.220
- Do we really have to sleep...?
- Enough.

13:21.720 --> 13:25.900
Miss Parkins, have Dr. Rhodes
show you around.

13:26.000 --> 13:28.620
- I'll sort out the children.
- Yes, headmistress.

13:28.720 --> 13:32.620
Right. Chop-chop. Let's make our beds.

13:32.720 --> 13:36.083
Through there's the kitchen.
Dining room's out the back.

13:38.280 --> 13:41.820
- What are you a doctor of?
- Medicine, retired.

13:41.920 --> 13:43.900
You work for the education board?

13:44.000 --> 13:48.000
I'm also an air raid warden.
We all do what we can.

13:51.320 --> 13:53.807
Classroom's in the library on the left.

13:55.120 --> 13:58.688
No lights up here yet, but there's
plenty of candles and oil lamps.

14:03.000 --> 14:05.123
These two are your bedrooms.

14:09.040 --> 14:11.402
Keep the rest locked
till the others arrive.

14:12.120 --> 14:13.651
That one?

14:14.560 --> 14:16.489
Oh, it should be locked.

14:36.880 --> 14:38.969
Do you think it was a nursery?

14:46.680 --> 14:50.340
It's so cold in here.

14:50.440 --> 14:53.660
We've put heaters downstairs,
but there's no central heating.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.928
I didn't mean that.

14:56.640 --> 14:58.524
It feels...

15:00.720 --> 15:03.540
I don't know... sad.

15:03.640 --> 15:06.764
Rooms aren't sad, Miss Parkins.
People are.

15:13.640 --> 15:15.080
Come on.

15:28.600 --> 15:31.940
So when can you send someone
round for the repairs?

15:32.040 --> 15:34.049
Who, Miss Parkins?

15:36.000 --> 15:38.660
Well, we'll make the best of it.

15:38.760 --> 15:40.530
I'd best be off.

15:48.360 --> 15:53.860
There are four corners to my bed,
four angels round my head,

15:53.960 --> 15:58.580
one to watch and one to pray
and two to bear my soul away.

15:58.680 --> 16:03.420
Now I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the Lord my soul to keep.

16:03.520 --> 16:08.282
If I should die before I wake,
I pray the Lord my soul to take.

16:09.520 --> 16:11.300
- Amen.
- Amen.

16:11.400 --> 16:13.887
Everybody, into your beds.

16:20.400 --> 16:22.380
Sleep well.

16:22.480 --> 16:24.460
Well done.

16:24.560 --> 16:26.842
There we go. Sleep well.

16:30.320 --> 16:31.965
Good boy.

16:34.480 --> 16:36.603
Is that your mommy?

16:39.880 --> 16:41.764
Very good.

16:43.080 --> 16:47.569
Promise me you'll sleep well
tonight. No bad dreams.

16:48.720 --> 16:51.500
Know what a nightmare is?

16:51.600 --> 16:55.500
It's your mind's way of letting go
of all the bad thoughts.

16:55.600 --> 16:58.531
Once you've dreamt them, they're gone.

17:11.960 --> 17:13.161
Oh, is it?

17:30.600 --> 17:33.540
You just do that, then, all right?

17:33.640 --> 17:35.900
We'll have you talking by tomorrow,
won't we, Edward?

17:36.000 --> 17:37.620
Can't have this nonsense
going on too long.

17:37.720 --> 17:39.580
It's under your bed.

17:39.680 --> 17:41.166
Come along, Miss Parkins.

17:45.320 --> 17:46.540
Edward.

17:46.640 --> 17:50.606
- It's all right.
- Let go.

17:52.720 --> 17:54.570
There's a good boy.

17:56.720 --> 17:58.524
He needs to learn.

17:59.640 --> 18:01.340
Will you turn off the generator
for the night

18:01.440 --> 18:05.565
- and lock up the house, please?
- Yes. Good night.

18:10.280 --> 18:12.050
Sleep well, children.

19:59.080 --> 20:01.647
Wh... Where have you taken him?

20:02.680 --> 20:04.689
Let me see him!

22:46.000 --> 22:47.645
Hello?

22:49.760 --> 22:51.325
Hello?

24:31.320 --> 24:32.931
Hello?

25:03.600 --> 25:06.820
Come on, let's go play!

25:06.920 --> 25:10.442
To the marsh. It's that way.
Come on, let's go to the marsh.

25:12.320 --> 25:13.780
Come on, keep up!

25:13.880 --> 25:16.460
You look like you had a bad night.

25:16.560 --> 25:19.660
Coming to a new place
always makes me restless.

25:19.760 --> 25:23.123
- Where's Edward?
- Inside, drawing.

25:28.040 --> 25:30.100
Miss Parkins, leave him be.

25:30.200 --> 25:32.460
He'll join us again when he's ready.

25:32.560 --> 25:34.980
I'm going to prepare the classroom.

25:40.320 --> 25:41.931
Come on, Alfie!

25:50.880 --> 25:53.940
- What are you doing?
- Tag, Miss. James was it.

25:54.040 --> 25:55.500
You shouldn't be running around.

25:55.600 --> 25:59.100
- Where's Edward?
- He's sitting on his bed.

25:59.200 --> 26:03.620
Oh, James, I thought you
were good friends with Edward.

26:03.720 --> 26:08.540
I know things have changed, but...
I'd like you to include him.

26:08.640 --> 26:11.081
It's times like this he needs a friend.

26:12.280 --> 26:13.766
Understand?

26:14.600 --> 26:17.531
OK.

26:37.840 --> 26:40.850
Come on, Edward. Let's play a game.

26:42.520 --> 26:44.660
Don't you want to be friends?

26:44.760 --> 26:49.620
- You have to. Miss said.
- It's all right.

26:49.720 --> 26:52.260
- Tom.
- He can have it back,

26:52.360 --> 26:54.420
- if he wins the game.
- What game?

26:54.520 --> 26:57.420
Hide-and-seek. Cover your eyes.

26:57.520 --> 26:58.721
Cover them.

27:02.200 --> 27:06.900
One, two, three,

27:07.000 --> 27:11.020
four, five, six...

27:11.120 --> 27:12.940
No peeking!

27:13.040 --> 27:15.580
...seven, eight,

27:15.680 --> 27:21.140
nine, ten, eleven, twelve,

27:21.240 --> 27:23.140
thirteen, fourteen,

27:23.640 --> 27:25.980
fifteen, sixteen...

27:26.080 --> 27:30.900
seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty!

29:02.440 --> 29:05.166
Tricked you! Your turn to hide.

29:06.480 --> 29:10.660
- One, two, three, four...
- Tom, I don't think...

29:10.760 --> 29:11.860
...five...

29:13.200 --> 29:14.731
seven...

29:15.760 --> 29:17.700
nine...

29:17.800 --> 29:19.540
We're not ready to look yet.

29:19.640 --> 29:23.340
Eleven, twelve, thirteen,

29:23.440 --> 29:27.740
fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen,

29:28.140 --> 29:32.363
eighteen, nineteen, twenty!

29:49.440 --> 29:52.291
- We're not ready to let you out yet.
- What's going on?

29:53.320 --> 29:54.931
James made me do it.

29:56.640 --> 29:59.780
- Did you lock it? Where's the key?
- We didn't.

29:59.880 --> 30:01.860
You must have unlocked it
in the first place.

30:01.960 --> 30:05.040
- It was open.
- Where is it?

30:05.140 --> 30:07.520
Edward? Edward, let me in!

30:14.760 --> 30:16.530
Edward?

30:21.280 --> 30:23.448
Come on, let's go downstairs.

30:30.040 --> 30:31.321
Come on.

31:02.120 --> 31:04.322
Would you get the door,
please, Miss Parkins?

31:23.960 --> 31:25.420
Hello.

31:25.520 --> 31:28.764
Just thought I'd come and check up on you,
see how you were getting on.

31:30.480 --> 31:32.700
I'm sorry, is this a bad time?

31:32.800 --> 31:34.900
No, not at all.

31:35.000 --> 31:37.089
Sorry. Come in.

31:51.040 --> 31:52.380
Give it back or I'll tell.

31:52.480 --> 31:54.250
I'll rip it.

32:00.240 --> 32:04.860
- So how's Sergeant Battle-ax?
- Oh! She'll hear.

32:04.960 --> 32:07.620
It's Brigadier. Well, wife of, anyway.

32:07.720 --> 32:09.331
Well, I'm not scared.

32:10.440 --> 32:11.794
Although, she does outrank me.

32:15.160 --> 32:18.660
How on earth are you
gonna stay sane out here?

32:18.760 --> 32:20.700
I don't know. Read?

32:20.800 --> 32:24.459
- Oh. Well, that sounds thrilling.
- Helps keep my mind off things.

32:24.559 --> 32:26.220
What things?

32:26.320 --> 32:29.251
Something about this place feels...

32:30.240 --> 32:31.601
well...

32:32.520 --> 32:34.324
Oh, I see. Psychic powers?

32:35.480 --> 32:37.728
All right, then.
Tell me what I'm thinking.

32:42.200 --> 32:43.481
You want a cup of tea?

32:45.200 --> 32:47.084
You'll have to tell me then.

32:50.640 --> 32:52.842
What's behind that smile?

33:00.760 --> 33:03.406
It's just my way, how I cope.

33:05.120 --> 33:08.620
- With the war?
- With everything.

33:08.720 --> 33:10.500
Miss Parkins!

33:12.280 --> 33:14.780
I think it's time we had
afternoon lessons, don't you?

33:14.880 --> 33:16.411
Yes, of course.

33:20.640 --> 33:22.763
Good day, Miss Parkins.

34:04.000 --> 34:06.380
Your stories can be
about whatever you'd like.

34:06.480 --> 34:11.402
Family, your home, a memory,
a faraway place.

34:11.880 --> 34:13.179
Yes, Joyce?

34:13.280 --> 34:15.020
Can we write about the people
that used to live in this...

34:15.120 --> 34:17.004
No, no, not about that.

34:20.600 --> 34:23.007
Edward, would you come with me, please?

34:31.000 --> 34:34.123
Can you tell me what happened
when the boys locked you in that room?

34:37.960 --> 34:40.699
Is that where you found this?

34:40.800 --> 34:41.820
You won't be in trouble.

34:41.920 --> 34:44.009
You just have to tell me
where you got it.

34:45.440 --> 34:46.846
Please, Edward.

34:58.240 --> 35:02.020
Who? Who told you not to tell?

35:02.120 --> 35:06.291
It's very, very important
that you tell me.

35:07.800 --> 35:11.402
You tell me. This is important!

35:24.520 --> 35:26.848
Did she tell you to say this to me?

35:49.560 --> 35:53.287
- I reckon he saw a ghost.
- A ghost?

35:53.920 --> 35:55.660
You did, didn't you, Edward?

35:55.760 --> 35:59.060
- Was it your mommy?
- I reckon so.

35:59.160 --> 36:02.980
- Leave him alone.
- Why? He's not your boyfriend.

36:03.080 --> 36:04.780
I'm telling Miss Hogg about all of you.

36:10.160 --> 36:12.840
Leave him alone! Stop being horrible.

36:54.000 --> 36:57.329
- Were you in the cellar?
- A few minutes ago.

36:59.120 --> 37:01.860
Not very pleasant, is it?

37:01.960 --> 37:05.243
- You'll have some tea?
- Thank you.

37:16.480 --> 37:19.380
You've taken quite a shine
to Flying Officer Burnstow.

37:19.480 --> 37:23.480
I'll be careful. I know
what everyone says about pilots.

37:24.400 --> 37:26.409
I don't think he's like that.

37:28.160 --> 37:30.460
No, nor do I.

37:30.560 --> 37:32.620
Reminds me of my husband.

37:32.720 --> 37:34.888
Something about the eyes.

37:36.480 --> 37:38.620
Was your husband called up?

37:38.720 --> 37:41.002
Oh, we've been in the services
our whole lives.

37:41.960 --> 37:44.620
Both army families. Now our boys.

37:44.720 --> 37:47.890
- I didn't know you had children.
- Well, they're not children.

37:49.240 --> 37:51.568
That changed the day they volunteered.

37:52.280 --> 37:54.209
Do you have any photos?

37:56.040 --> 37:58.500
- I know what they look like.
- But you must miss them.

37:58.600 --> 38:00.643
Will you excuse me?

38:09.040 --> 38:10.571
I'm sorry.

38:13.400 --> 38:16.001
It's just we all have our ways
of coping. This is mine.

38:19.160 --> 38:21.010
Well, I'm sure they'll come back to you.

38:22.480 --> 38:24.569
My husband teases me.

38:26.480 --> 38:29.580
Says I'm the toughest soldier
he's ever met.

38:29.680 --> 38:33.327
That he cuts his men more slack
than I do my pupils.

38:34.880 --> 38:37.526
But our own worst enemy is ourselves.

38:38.760 --> 38:42.362
Our fears, doubts.

38:44.160 --> 38:46.328
Despair.

38:48.720 --> 38:51.446
That's what'll destroy us.

38:54.280 --> 38:56.980
Good night, Eve.
I hope you sleep better tonight.

38:57.080 --> 38:58.645
Me too.

39:43.480 --> 39:45.170
Come on.

41:23.320 --> 41:26.100
Lost her baby

41:26.200 --> 41:28.940
Died on Sunday

41:29.040 --> 41:32.060
Seen on Monday

41:32.160 --> 41:34.980
Who'll die next?

41:35.080 --> 41:38.250
It must be you

41:54.720 --> 41:56.251
Tom!

41:57.920 --> 41:59.300
Tom!

41:59.400 --> 42:01.409
- What's happening?
- Tom?

42:04.000 --> 42:07.820
- Tom!
- Where are you?

42:07.920 --> 42:10.180
Where's Tom?

42:10.280 --> 42:13.780
I don't know.
He was gone when I woke up.

42:13.880 --> 42:16.321
Come out now! This isn't funny!

42:29.640 --> 42:31.900
But I... I locked it.

42:32.000 --> 42:33.531
Tom!

42:36.320 --> 42:37.760
Tom!

42:40.280 --> 42:41.845
Tom!

42:44.040 --> 42:45.526
Tom!

42:46.760 --> 42:48.041
Tom!

42:51.320 --> 42:53.045
Tom!

42:59.280 --> 43:01.084
Tom!

43:12.260 --> 43:13.607
Tom.

43:23.320 --> 43:24.601
Tom?

43:25.840 --> 43:29.726
Jean!

43:32.960 --> 43:34.889
Oh, no!

43:36.680 --> 43:40.020
Last night was a terrible accident,

43:40.120 --> 43:42.780
but I know how good you all are
at coping with accidents

43:42.880 --> 43:45.082
when they happen back home.

43:45.840 --> 43:48.780
But you must understand

43:48.880 --> 43:52.660
that even though
we came here to be safe,

43:52.760 --> 43:57.780
that out in the countryside,
here, there's still danger.

44:01.320 --> 44:05.260
Now, I want everyone to stay
together today, even at playtime.

44:05.360 --> 44:07.164
Do you understand me?

44:13.120 --> 44:15.084
I'll write to the boy's mother.

44:25.325 --> 44:27.809
I'm sure that I locked it.

44:28.200 --> 44:29.500
I'm sorry.

44:29.600 --> 44:32.980
I don't think any of us
could ever be sorry enough.

44:33.080 --> 44:35.060
Doctor, I don't think
we should stay here.

44:35.160 --> 44:38.420
- I've told you, there's nowhere else.
- But it isn't safe.

44:38.520 --> 44:42.140
- It's all of our jobs to make it safe.
- Sorry, no, I didn't mean that.

44:42.240 --> 44:44.260
Well, what's your point, then?

44:45.208 --> 44:46.579
Well?

44:46.679 --> 44:49.620
Are you sure
there's nobody else living here?

44:49.720 --> 44:53.720
- What do you mean?
- I... I think I saw someone.

44:54.760 --> 44:56.660
Did you speak to them?

44:56.760 --> 45:01.284
I tried, I called out,
but she disappeared.

45:02.400 --> 45:04.780
I think you should keep
your visions to yourself.

45:04.880 --> 45:07.020
Not visions. You're not listening to me.

45:07.120 --> 45:09.260
No, you listen to me.

45:09.360 --> 45:13.620
This is not the first body I've pulled
from barbed wire, Miss Parkins.

45:13.720 --> 45:17.700
I remember the last war.
I've seen what it can do.

45:17.800 --> 45:19.889
You need to be better prepared
for this one.

45:33.560 --> 45:35.980
There you are, Edward.

45:36.080 --> 45:39.170
Come back into the house, please.

46:38.800 --> 46:39.887
Wait!

46:42.040 --> 46:43.321
Come back!

46:51.160 --> 46:52.725
Come back!

47:52.880 --> 47:55.604
All right. All right.

47:57.120 --> 47:58.610
What is it?

48:00.600 --> 48:03.700
- Sorry.
- Don't be.

48:03.800 --> 48:06.300
What happened was terrible,
but it wasn't your fault.

48:06.400 --> 48:08.260
I had the key.

48:08.360 --> 48:11.380
A key. There must be others.

48:11.480 --> 48:13.780
He could have just found one
lying around the house.

48:13.880 --> 48:17.448
- Or someone else unlocked it.
- Who?

48:20.040 --> 48:22.527
No, what? What were you gonna say?

48:24.200 --> 48:26.721
I think there's somebody else
on this island.

48:27.560 --> 48:29.540
Living here?

48:29.640 --> 48:32.491
I saw them in the cellar
and then by the graveyard.

48:36.000 --> 48:38.060
Forget it.

48:38.160 --> 48:40.660
It's just me.
I haven't been sleeping well.

48:40.760 --> 48:42.325
I'm just seeing things.

48:46.000 --> 48:48.420
Right, come on.
Let's go and take a look.

48:48.520 --> 48:50.290
You believe me?

48:51.160 --> 48:52.740
Why shouldn't I?

49:04.440 --> 49:07.086
Was that you we saw
flying over last night?

49:10.800 --> 49:13.162
No. Not my turn.

49:17.880 --> 49:20.560
I don't think I've seen
one of these since I was a boy.

49:37.760 --> 49:40.327
I'm gonna go see if this fits anything.

50:23.400 --> 50:26.020
My name is Alice Drablow.

50:26.120 --> 50:28.980
Lived at Eel Marsh House my whole life.

50:29.080 --> 50:32.124
It is the 19th of October, 18...

50:32.840 --> 50:34.180
never be believed,

50:34.280 --> 50:39.340
I feel the events I am experiencing
must be recorded.

50:39.440 --> 50:43.645
Perhaps one day...
they will be understood.

50:49.600 --> 50:53.420
It all began
with the death of Nathaniel.

50:53.520 --> 50:55.540
He was no less of a son to me.

50:55.640 --> 50:57.540
She may have bore him, but I raised him.

50:57.640 --> 50:59.808
I provided when she could not.

51:01.440 --> 51:04.420
We were coming home across the causeway.

51:04.520 --> 51:06.700
The horse somehow lost its footing.

51:06.800 --> 51:09.685
The carriage was thrown into the marsh.

51:11.240 --> 51:13.920
She saw it happen from the nursery.

51:15.760 --> 51:17.530
He sank so fast.

51:18.800 --> 51:21.048
Before I knew it, he was lost.

51:22.400 --> 51:23.806
Gone.

51:30.520 --> 51:32.290
She blames me.

51:34.840 --> 51:38.540
So that I may suffer Nathaniel's death
again and again,

51:38.640 --> 51:42.820
she makes me watch
so I can see what she saw,

51:42.920 --> 51:45.771
- feel what she felt.
- ...felt.

51:55.784 --> 51:57.580
See what I saw.

51:57.680 --> 52:00.220
Get away from me, Jennet.

52:00.320 --> 52:02.363
Feel what I felt.

52:03.960 --> 52:06.208
I'm imagining you.

52:07.280 --> 52:09.289
You're not real.

52:37.400 --> 52:43.060
So Jennet was Nathaniel's mother,
but Alice brought him up.

52:43.160 --> 52:45.820
Until he drowned.

52:45.920 --> 52:50.091
That's what I heard.
The carriage falling into the marsh.

52:53.240 --> 52:55.900
I must be going mad.

52:56.000 --> 53:00.260
No. No, I believe you saw someone,

53:00.360 --> 53:02.780
and I believe that
something happened here.

53:02.880 --> 53:05.287
But we've looked everywhere
on the island.

53:07.160 --> 53:09.362
I know where I've seen
these letters before.

53:10.360 --> 53:12.130
The village.

53:15.280 --> 53:17.140
I have to report back to base.

53:17.240 --> 53:19.647
I'll drop you off first.
Shouldn't be long.

53:22.800 --> 53:24.820
- What's wrong?
- The tide's coming in.

53:24.920 --> 53:27.580
- We need to hurry.
- It's fine.

53:27.680 --> 53:29.166
No, it's not!

53:33.640 --> 53:35.046
Slow down!

53:37.680 --> 53:39.460
- Harry!
- Just be quiet!

53:39.560 --> 53:41.330
I need to concentrate.

54:12.200 --> 54:14.721
We were shot down over the sea.

54:17.760 --> 54:20.930
My crew were trapped
in the fuselage as it went under.

54:23.680 --> 54:25.962
I could hear them calling to me.

54:30.360 --> 54:36.203
I tried to swim back down
to them, but... it was so dark.

54:37.200 --> 54:39.260
Couldn't breathe properly.

54:39.360 --> 54:42.530
- I'm sure it wasn't...
- No, it was. They were my crew.

54:47.200 --> 54:49.084
I was the only survivor.

54:51.760 --> 54:54.167
So now I don't like the water.

55:19.400 --> 55:21.045
How did you get this?

55:22.240 --> 55:24.100
Tom had it in his pocket
the night he died.

55:24.200 --> 55:26.243
How did you get it back?

55:32.360 --> 55:34.608
- Get out the way.
- James, get off!

56:20.800 --> 56:22.161
Hello?

56:24.920 --> 56:26.606
Hello?

56:32.400 --> 56:34.125
Edward?

56:37.480 --> 56:39.220
Edward?

56:39.320 --> 56:41.841
Mrs. Hogg says you need to come now.

56:48.520 --> 56:50.085
Edward?

56:52.320 --> 56:54.090
Edward, this isn't funny.

57:26.120 --> 57:28.971
Edward, you're in so much trouble.

58:23.600 --> 58:25.040
Edward?

58:44.240 --> 58:47.540
Edward? Edward.

58:47.640 --> 58:49.842
Don't be such a...

58:55.120 --> 58:58.130
- Here.
- Who's there?

58:59.440 --> 59:01.210
Let me out!

59:08.520 --> 59:13.220
Whenever she's seen, and whoever by,

59:13.320 --> 59:16.140
One thing's certain,

59:16.240 --> 59:18.300
a child shall die.

59:23.680 --> 59:25.540
- Tell me how to stop her.
- You're too late.

59:25.640 --> 59:28.923
We tried. She killed all my friends.
Now I'm the last.

59:30.320 --> 59:33.900
Come back, please.
We'll leave, then. We'll leave, then!

59:39.760 --> 59:41.340
You brought her back.

59:41.440 --> 59:44.260
Your fault. Your fault.
You brought her back.

59:44.360 --> 59:47.622
You brought her back. Your fault.

59:49.360 --> 59:52.604
Your fault. Your fault.

01:00:00.360 --> 01:00:02.580
Who'll die next?

01:00:02.680 --> 01:00:05.884
It must be you

01:00:12.412 --> 01:00:14.228
Never needed eyes to hunt.

01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:19.047
No.

01:00:20.200 --> 01:00:23.882
My friends had eyes, and so I cried.

01:00:25.080 --> 01:00:27.220
My friends had eyes, and so they died.

01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:35.482
Joyce, you're not meant
to be in this room.

01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:37.770
Joyce!

01:00:42.680 --> 01:00:44.006
Your fault!

01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:46.444
Your fault!

01:00:53.480 --> 01:00:55.205
Harry!

01:00:58.320 --> 01:01:00.300
Harry! Harry!

01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:02.660
- All right? Get in.
- Please, let's go.

01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:04.689
- What's happened?
- Quickly!

01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:42.740
I tried to tell you the truth,
but you were too young to understand.

01:01:42.840 --> 01:01:47.660
I tried to take you away,
but they discovered my plan.

01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:52.020
Now they won't let me near you.
They are sending me to an asylum.

01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:56.060
So I'm leaving this letter
with my solicitor, Mr. Jerome.

01:01:56.160 --> 01:01:59.125
They cannot stop him from giving it
to you when you are older.

01:01:59.960 --> 01:02:02.500
You were brought up thinking
Alice Drablow was your mother,

01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:04.700
- But she is not."
- But she is not.

01:02:04.800 --> 01:02:08.020
Your father, Charles Drablow,
got me pregnant.

01:02:08.120 --> 01:02:10.660
This is the truth. Please believe it.

01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:13.220
I will never let you go.

01:02:13.320 --> 01:02:16.620
So, please,
come to me as soon as you can,

01:02:16.720 --> 01:02:20.180
for I was, am, and always
shall be your mother.

01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:23.245
- Jennet Humfrye.
- "Jennet Humfrye."

01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:26.329
He died two days later.

01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:30.324
So he never knew.

01:02:33.280 --> 01:02:35.369
Never knew she was his mother.

01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:40.980
It's preposterous.

01:02:41.080 --> 01:02:43.740
Even if you don't believe me,
why take the chance?

01:02:43.840 --> 01:02:45.740
Harry will take us to the station
and we'll just leave...

01:02:45.840 --> 01:02:47.140
- Enough.
- Jean.

01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:50.410
- I am telling you that we have to...
- Get out!

01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:53.340
Go on.

01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:56.220
You want to? I don't want you
here a moment longer.

01:02:56.320 --> 01:02:59.380
No! I won't leave them here.

01:02:59.480 --> 01:03:01.340
I found Joyce today
trying to strangle herself.

01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:04.140
Don't you see? You're poisoning them.

01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:06.780
That was Jennet!

01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:08.740
Don't you see? She's been seen.

01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:12.620
We can't leave. We need to get
the children to the cellar. Now.

01:03:12.720 --> 01:03:15.300
That's right, come along.
Quick as you can.

01:03:15.400 --> 01:03:17.940
- Come along. Come along. Girls.
- Be careful.

01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:22.820
Stay away from the glass.

01:03:22.920 --> 01:03:24.820
Be careful.

01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:29.921
It's OK.

01:03:39.920 --> 01:03:42.600
Nobody deserves to suffer like she did.

01:03:45.480 --> 01:03:47.340
Why has this got to you?

01:03:49.610 --> 01:03:51.440
Eve?

01:03:52.480 --> 01:03:55.700
I had a child. A son.

01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:02.684
I wasn't married.

01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.202
I was too young, so they...

01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:09.004
they took him away from me.

01:04:10.520 --> 01:04:12.165
Where did you...?

01:04:15.280 --> 01:04:17.020
Where did you...?

01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:20.060
Let me see him, please.

01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:22.488
I tried looking for him, but...

01:04:25.320 --> 01:04:28.000
they wouldn't tell me where he was.

01:04:30.800 --> 01:04:32.684
Or his name.

01:04:35.960 --> 01:04:38.242
After a while, I just gave up.

01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:44.205
I let him go.

01:04:45.520 --> 01:04:47.006
Eve.

01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:51.820
We can't let the past pull us under.

01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:55.688
There's just too much to do.

01:04:57.280 --> 01:04:59.721
Too much to live for, right?

01:05:03.960 --> 01:05:05.380
She knows.

01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:07.980
No, this has got nothing to do with her.

01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:11.540
She told me, "You let him go."

01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:16.060
That was for Alice. Remember? She said
she blamed her for Nathaniel's death.

01:05:16.160 --> 01:05:18.780
Made her watch it over and over again.

01:05:18.880 --> 01:05:21.180
This has got nothing to do with you.

01:05:21.280 --> 01:05:24.900
- You're wrong.
- Eve, you need to listen to me.

01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:27.460
She wants to take something
away from me.

01:05:27.560 --> 01:05:29.250
What?

01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:32.883
She wants to turn him against me.

01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.900
- Everybody, stay together.
- It's only a draft.

01:05:46.000 --> 01:05:49.409
Edward, come here. Come here.
Stay close.

01:05:50.720 --> 01:05:52.604
My lighter's out of fuel.

01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:55.340
Miss, I've found some matches.

01:05:55.440 --> 01:05:56.926
Oh, good girl.

01:05:58.880 --> 01:06:00.140
That's right.

01:06:10.240 --> 01:06:12.363
Give it to me. Let me do it.

01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:48.500
Good. Let's get the other ones lit.

01:06:48.600 --> 01:06:50.131
Where's Joyce?

01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:52.521
Joyce?

01:06:54.440 --> 01:06:55.926
Joyce?

01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:11.540
Joyce! Joyce!

01:07:12.972 --> 01:07:14.900
Joyce!

01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:17.086
Joyce!

01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:23.003
Joyce?

01:07:23.480 --> 01:07:24.966
Joyce?

01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:30.020
- Oh, no. Joyce!
- Joyce!

01:07:30.120 --> 01:07:32.380
- No, no, no, no!
- Joyce...

01:07:32.480 --> 01:07:35.380
Oh! Oh, please, not again, no!

01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:41.970
No!

01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:07.860
Tide's cleared, so I can take you all
back to the village

01:08:07.960 --> 01:08:10.660
and then we'll figure out
a way to get you home.

01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:12.644
I'm not going back there.

01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:15.605
Take us to the airfield.

01:08:21.840 --> 01:08:23.564
All right.

01:08:24.399 --> 01:08:26.700
Ruby, that's yours.

01:08:26.800 --> 01:08:28.620
You should leave that. It belongs here.

01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:31.526
Give it to me. Give to me. Edward!

01:09:12.520 --> 01:09:14.448
Thank you, Alfie.

01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:18.122
Come back here, Fraser!

01:09:27.080 --> 01:09:28.691
Not real.

01:09:31.680 --> 01:09:33.086
Harry?

01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:39.126
Harry!

01:09:40.439 --> 01:09:43.420
- Harry!
- It's a dummy airfield.

01:09:43.520 --> 01:09:46.500
So the Nazis bomb here
instead of a real one.

01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:49.340
I move lights around,
make it look like planes are taking off.

01:09:49.439 --> 01:09:52.564
And I start fire baskets,
make it look like they've hit us.

01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:58.820
- I'm a decoy.
- You said you were a pilot.

01:09:58.920 --> 01:10:03.364
I was, but after the crash...
I couldn't fly anymore.

01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:09.007
So they sent me here, demoted me.

01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.420
"Lack of moral fiber," they said.

01:10:12.520 --> 01:10:14.051
LMF.

01:10:15.880 --> 01:10:17.491
Means you're a coward.

01:10:18.760 --> 01:10:21.780
- Officially.
- Why didn't you tell me?

01:10:21.880 --> 01:10:24.208
I liked the way you saw me.

01:10:27.160 --> 01:10:30.921
See? There's that smile again.

01:11:08.840 --> 01:11:10.644
Don't look at that.

01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:14.380
We'll get the next train out of here.

01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:16.620
- When's that, Miss?
- Tomorrow morning.

01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:19.340
But... we'll be safe here till then.

01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:21.130
OK, go sit down.

01:11:35.200 --> 01:11:36.925
This you?

01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:41.164
Used to be.

01:12:02.680 --> 01:12:04.980
- Miss?
- Yes, Flora?

01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:07.442
Tom said Edward saw a ghost.

01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:10.364
Is it true?

01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:16.060
- Yes.
- These are lies, children.

01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:19.443
- There's no such thing...
- Right, that's enough.

01:12:22.480 --> 01:12:23.806
She's telling the truth.

01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:27.689
I'm tired of secrets.

01:12:40.480 --> 01:12:42.091
Did she give it back to you?

01:12:45.760 --> 01:12:48.645
I'm sorry if I've upset you,
but you have to tell me.

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:51.081
Please.

01:12:54.282 --> 01:12:55.260
What's that?

01:13:02.560 --> 01:13:04.220
This isn't real.

01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:06.100
I don't want to lose you.

01:13:06.200 --> 01:13:09.220
- This isn't real.
- You can't have him!

01:13:09.320 --> 01:13:12.380
- He's not yours!
- You're scaring the children.

01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:24.047
She's set off the fire baskets!
Damn things won't turn off.

01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:31.700
Everybody, stay close.

01:13:31.800 --> 01:13:34.060
- Please be quiet.
- Let's hold hands.

01:13:34.160 --> 01:13:37.220
And then if anyone lets go,
two of us will know about it.

01:13:37.320 --> 01:13:39.100
- Don't be so...
- Do it!

01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:46.420
His friends had eyes, so they died.

01:13:46.520 --> 01:13:48.643
The blind man couldn't see her.
Close your eyes.

01:13:49.240 --> 01:13:51.660
Everybody.

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:54.420
Let's say our prayer before bedtime,
all right? Come on.

01:13:54.520 --> 01:13:59.020
There are four corners to my bed,
four angels round my head.

01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:03.140
One to watch, one to pray,
and two to bear my soul away.

01:14:03.240 --> 01:14:07.020
There are four corners to my bed,
four angels round my head.

01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:11.980
One to watch and one to pray,
and two to bear my soul away.

01:14:12.080 --> 01:14:15.363
It's all right, it's all right,
it's all right. It's fine.

01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:30.500
It's all right. Don't look.

01:14:30.600 --> 01:14:32.900
Hold on. Hold on.

01:14:37.040 --> 01:14:39.129
- It's madness.
- Jean.

01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:43.620
- We're all going...
- Jean.

01:14:43.720 --> 01:14:45.490
- ...mad.
- Jean!

01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:50.020
This is madness.

01:14:53.400 --> 01:14:55.025
Eve!

01:14:56.440 --> 01:14:58.608
Edward? Edward!

01:14:59.120 --> 01:15:00.540
Wait!

01:15:00.640 --> 01:15:02.507
Edward!

01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.565
Edward!

01:15:21.480 --> 01:15:23.220
Edward?

01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:33.360
Edward!

01:15:39.800 --> 01:15:42.128
Edward, it's me, it's Harry!

01:15:50.683 --> 01:15:52.883
Edward, it's me, it's Harry.

01:15:55.880 --> 01:15:58.420
It's all right. They've gone.

01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:00.203
Edward?

01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:04.006
You're all right. You're all right.

01:16:05.080 --> 01:16:06.281
Take my hand.

01:16:16.720 --> 01:16:18.604
Edward!

01:16:21.840 --> 01:16:25.169
Edward! No! Edward!

01:16:57.680 --> 01:16:59.120
Eve.

01:17:11.000 --> 01:17:13.009
Nice and slow.

01:17:15.600 --> 01:17:17.086
Come on.

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:19.601
Yeah, that's it.

01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:24.130
Where's Edward?

01:17:29.200 --> 01:17:31.050
- Oh...
- I'm so sorry.

01:17:33.520 --> 01:17:34.926
I tried.

01:17:36.120 --> 01:17:39.449
I really tried, but...

01:17:41.800 --> 01:17:45.004
One of the fire baskets. I'm so sorry.

01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:48.180
Fraser. Fraser.

01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:51.563
Did you... Did you see his body?

01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:56.324
- There was nothing left.
- Did you see his body?

01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:09.020
I'm sorry.

01:18:09.120 --> 01:18:11.100
It's not enough for him
to die like that.

01:18:11.200 --> 01:18:13.060
- Why would she do that?
- What?

01:18:13.160 --> 01:18:14.980
That's not enough of a punishment.

01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:16.850
What do you mean, it's not...

01:18:17.440 --> 01:18:19.500
Eve. What...?

01:18:19.600 --> 01:18:22.300
- No.
- No, listen...

01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:23.980
All right, listen to me. Listen.

01:18:24.080 --> 01:18:25.340
- No!
- Eve!

01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:27.140
No!

01:18:27.240 --> 01:18:29.429
Eve... Eve.

01:18:30.960 --> 01:18:33.020
Sweetheart, there's nothing
you could have done.

01:18:33.120 --> 01:18:37.340
It's not your fault at all.
You mustn't blame yourself.

01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:40.740
Come on, hurry up! You've been
in this godforsaken place too long!

01:18:40.840 --> 01:18:42.883
Come on, pick your feet up.

01:18:45.320 --> 01:18:47.100
On the bus. Come on.

01:18:47.200 --> 01:18:49.340
Get up. Quickly. Come on.

01:18:49.440 --> 01:18:51.340
Eve.

01:18:51.440 --> 01:18:53.290
I should have listened to you.

01:18:54.400 --> 01:18:56.204
I'll never forgive myself.

01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:07.121
- He's alive.
- What?

01:19:08.960 --> 01:19:10.740
- They're waiting for me.
- Come on!

01:19:10.840 --> 01:19:12.246
Then take the jeep.

01:19:13.400 --> 01:19:15.125
Now.

01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:17.440
Yeah.

01:19:21.006 --> 01:19:22.087
Eve?

01:19:23.160 --> 01:19:24.361
Eve!

01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:29.206
Eve!

01:19:30.720 --> 01:19:32.604
Eve!

01:20:04.560 --> 01:20:06.762
Edward?

01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:54.813
Mommy.

01:22:56.800 --> 01:22:59.700
Where's he gone? Let me see him!

01:23:07.407 --> 01:23:08.884
Show me Edward!

01:23:10.120 --> 01:23:12.940
Let me see him!

01:25:15.640 --> 01:25:16.940
No!

01:25:24.880 --> 01:25:27.580
Edward! No!

01:25:27.680 --> 01:25:30.020
- See what I saw.
- No!

01:25:30.120 --> 01:25:31.700
Edward!

01:25:32.100 --> 01:25:34.685
Feel what I felt.

01:25:36.640 --> 01:25:39.286
Die how I died.

01:25:48.120 --> 01:25:52.450
Let me out! No! No! Let me out!

01:26:34.960 --> 01:26:36.650
Edward!

01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:40.420
Come back!

01:26:40.520 --> 01:26:43.451
Stop! Stop! Don't go!

01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:46.644
Edward!

01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:52.979
Edward!

01:26:53.800 --> 01:26:55.331
Edward!

01:26:56.200 --> 01:26:58.209
Wake up, Edward!

01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:00.936
Wake up, Edward, please!

01:27:14.520 --> 01:27:18.406
Edward... you have to fight her!

01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:21.860
You have to fight her! Edward!

01:27:23.010 --> 01:27:25.323
Please, Edward!

01:27:29.840 --> 01:27:33.408
You... You fight bad dreams
with... with good thoughts.

01:27:34.400 --> 01:27:37.843
You fight bad dreams...
with good thoughts.

01:27:39.120 --> 01:27:42.483
Do you remember
when your mother told you that?

01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:00.282
No!

01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:56.860
Eve!

01:28:56.960 --> 01:28:58.889
Go! Go!

01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:08.460
Harry!

01:29:10.800 --> 01:29:14.237
Harry! Harry!

01:29:40.120 --> 01:29:42.060
I'm sorry.

01:30:02.400 --> 01:30:04.364
She's gone.

01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:37.371
- Ready?
- Yes.

01:30:38.760 --> 01:30:42.851
Very smart. Happy birthday, Edward.

01:30:50.520 --> 01:30:53.291
So you can make new drawings.

01:30:55.360 --> 01:30:57.289
What's wrong?

01:30:57.920 --> 01:30:59.246
Will she come back?

01:31:00.640 --> 01:31:02.540
She's gone.

01:31:02.640 --> 01:31:04.900
She fed on all our bad feelings.

01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:08.580
But now Harry's watching over us,
she can't come back.

01:31:08.680 --> 01:31:11.780
- You understand?
- Yes.

01:31:11.880 --> 01:31:13.206
Now where's my smile?

01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:16.568
- Very good.
- Your turn.

01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:32.411
Right, time to go.

01:38:30.840 --> 01:38:32.041
