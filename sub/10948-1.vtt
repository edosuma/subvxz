00:02.500 --> 00:03.840
KATARA: <i>Water...</i>

00:04.880 --> 00:06.300
<i>Earth...</i>

00:06.800 --> 00:08.130
<i>Fire...</i>

00:09.050 --> 00:10.300
<i>Air.</i>

00:11.140 --> 00:14.640
<i>Long ago, the four nations
lived together in harmony.</i>

00:15.310 --> 00:18.810
<i>Then, everything changed
when the Fire Nation attacked.</i>

00:19.690 --> 00:22.570
<i>Only the Avatar,
master of all four elements,</i>

00:22.650 --> 00:23.780
<i>could stop them.</i>

00:23.860 --> 00:25.530
<i>But when the world needed him most,</i>

00:25.610 --> 00:26.860
<i>he vanished.</i>

00:27.320 --> 00:28.400
<i>100 years passed,</i>

00:28.490 --> 00:31.200
<i>and my brother and I
discovered the new Avatar―</i>

00:31.280 --> 00:32.830
<i>An airbender named Aang.</i>

00:32.910 --> 00:35.120
<i>And although his airbending
skills are great,</i>

00:35.200 --> 00:37.830
<i>he has a lot to learn
before he's ready to save anyone.</i>

00:37.910 --> 00:39.080
AANG: Oof.

00:39.170 --> 00:41.830
KATARA: <i>But I believe</i>
<i>Aang can save the world.</i>

01:23.130 --> 01:24.210
Aah!

01:33.220 --> 01:34.720
( AANG BREATHING HEAVILY )

01:39.400 --> 01:40.400
Aang?

01:42.270 --> 01:43.690
Do you want to talk about it?

01:43.780 --> 01:46.610
Nah. Just a nightmare.

01:46.700 --> 01:48.820
I was in the Avatar state,

01:48.910 --> 01:51.070
But I was outside my body,
watching myself.

01:51.950 --> 01:53.450
It was scary.

01:53.540 --> 01:55.000
I was scary.

02:00.580 --> 02:03.340
Katara, I want you to have this.

02:03.420 --> 02:06.340
This amulet contains
water from the spirit oasis.

02:07.050 --> 02:09.090
The water has unique properties.

02:09.180 --> 02:10.510
Don't lose it.

02:11.180 --> 02:12.800
Thank you, Master Pakku.

02:12.890 --> 02:16.350
Aang, these scrolls
will help you master waterbending.

02:16.430 --> 02:20.440
But remember,
they're no substitute for a real master.

02:25.440 --> 02:26.440
Sokka...

02:27.900 --> 02:29.610
Take care, son.

02:31.570 --> 02:34.780
Fly straight to the Earth Kingdom
base to the east of here.

02:34.870 --> 02:38.040
General Fong will provide you
with an escort to Omashu.

02:38.500 --> 02:43.500
There you'll be safe to begin
your earthbending training with King Bumi.

02:43.590 --> 02:46.130
- Appa, yip-yip!
- KATARA: Say hi to Gran-Gran for me.

02:54.600 --> 02:55.760
Ahh.

02:57.220 --> 02:59.810
This is what I've been missing.

02:59.890 --> 03:03.770
Who knew floating
on a piece of driftwood for three weeks

03:03.860 --> 03:05.520
with no food or water

03:06.270 --> 03:09.280
and sea vultures
waiting to pluck out your liver

03:09.360 --> 03:11.700
could make one so tense?

03:13.780 --> 03:18.120
I see. It's the anniversary, isn't it?

03:18.200 --> 03:20.790
Three years ago today, I was banished.

03:20.870 --> 03:23.710
I lost it all. I want it back.

03:24.250 --> 03:28.130
I want the Avatar.
I want my honor, my throne.

03:28.210 --> 03:31.090
I want my father
not to think I'm worthless.

03:31.340 --> 03:36.430
I'm sure he doesn't.
Why would he banish you if he didn't care?

03:38.850 --> 03:41.310
Uh, that came out wrong, didn't it?

04:05.330 --> 04:08.750
My brother and my uncle
have disgraced the Fire Lord,

04:08.840 --> 04:10.460
and brought shame on all of us.

04:11.010 --> 04:14.430
You may have mixed feelings about
attacking members of the royal family.

04:14.510 --> 04:16.890
I understand. But I assure you,

04:16.970 --> 04:21.100
if you hesitate, I will not hesitate
to bring you down.

04:21.600 --> 04:23.100
Dismissed.

04:23.980 --> 04:28.230
Princess, I'm afraid the tides will not
allow us to bring the ship into port

04:28.310 --> 04:29.440
before nightfall.

04:29.520 --> 04:32.740
I'm sorry, captain, but I do not know
much about the tides.

04:33.190 --> 04:34.820
Can you explain something to me?

04:35.410 --> 04:36.870
Of course, your highness.

04:36.950 --> 04:38.870
Do the tides command this ship?

04:39.120 --> 04:41.830
Uh, I'm afraid I don't understand.

04:41.910 --> 04:45.580
You said the tides
would not allow us to bring the ship in.

04:45.670 --> 04:47.830
Do the tides command this ship?

04:48.210 --> 04:49.210
No, princess.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.800
And if I were to have you
thrown overboard,

04:51.880 --> 04:56.430
would the tides think twice about
smashing you against the rocky shore?

04:56.510 --> 04:57.970
No, princess.

04:58.050 --> 05:00.970
Well, then maybe you should
worry less about the tides,

05:01.060 --> 05:03.480
who've already made up
their mind about killing you

05:03.560 --> 05:06.350
and worry more about me,
who's still mulling it over.

05:06.900 --> 05:08.100
I'll pull us in.

05:13.400 --> 05:14.440
There it is!

05:21.700 --> 05:24.250
Welcome, Avatar Aang!

05:24.790 --> 05:27.000
I am General Fong.

05:27.080 --> 05:30.170
And welcome to all of you great heroes―

05:30.250 --> 05:35.050
Appa, Momo, brave Sokka,
the mighty Katara.

05:35.550 --> 05:37.470
Mighty Katara? I like that.

05:37.550 --> 05:38.720
( FIREWORKS )

05:38.800 --> 05:39.840
( MOMO CHATTERING )

05:44.560 --> 05:46.230
Not bad. Not bad.

05:47.890 --> 05:50.560
Avatar Aang, we were all amazed

05:50.650 --> 05:53.150
at the stories of how
you single-handedly wiped out

05:53.230 --> 05:55.400
an entire fire navy fleet
at the North Pole.

05:56.030 --> 05:59.780
I can't imagine what it feels like
to wield such devastating power.

05:59.860 --> 06:01.820
It's an awesome responsibility.

06:01.910 --> 06:03.910
I try not to think about it too much.

06:04.910 --> 06:08.580
Avatar, you're ready
to face the Fire Lord now.

06:08.670 --> 06:10.710
What?! No, I'm not.

06:11.290 --> 06:13.840
Aang still needs to master
all four elements.

06:14.090 --> 06:16.880
Why? With the kind of power he possesses,

06:16.970 --> 06:20.300
Power enough to destroy hundreds
of battleships in a matter of minutes,

06:20.390 --> 06:22.260
He could defeat the Fire Lord now.

06:22.350 --> 06:24.850
But, sir, the thing is,
Aang can only do those things

06:24.930 --> 06:26.720
when he's in the Avatar state.

06:26.810 --> 06:28.690
See, it's this special state where―

06:28.770 --> 06:31.400
I'm well aware.
Your eyes and tattoos glow,

06:31.480 --> 06:34.230
and you're able to summon
unbelievable power.

06:34.940 --> 06:38.110
Without you, we'd be slaughtered
before we even reach their shores.

06:38.190 --> 06:40.860
But with you leading the way,
as the ultimate weapon,

06:41.240 --> 06:44.580
we could cut a swath right through
to the heart of the Fire Nation.

06:44.910 --> 06:49.250
Right, but I don't know how
to get in or out of the Avatar state,

06:49.790 --> 06:51.920
much less what to do once I'm there.

06:52.130 --> 06:53.460
FONG: So it's decided, then.

06:53.540 --> 06:56.300
I'll help you figure out
how to get into the Avatar state,

06:56.380 --> 06:58.010
and then you'll face your destiny.

06:58.090 --> 06:59.970
No. Nothing's decided.

07:00.050 --> 07:01.680
We already have a plan.

07:01.930 --> 07:04.180
Aang's pursuing his destiny his way.

07:04.510 --> 07:07.720
FONG: Well, while you take your time
learning the elements,

07:07.810 --> 07:09.480
the war goes on.

07:10.310 --> 07:11.600
May I show you something?

07:12.900 --> 07:14.560
That's the infirmary.

07:14.650 --> 07:18.820
And those soldiers
are the lucky ones. They came back.

07:19.240 --> 07:21.570
Every day the Fire Nation takes lives.

07:21.650 --> 07:23.450
People are dying, Aang.

07:23.950 --> 07:25.910
You could end it now.

07:26.370 --> 07:27.370
Think about it.

07:46.800 --> 07:48.350
Almost perfect.

07:48.430 --> 07:50.520
One hair out of place.

07:52.230 --> 07:53.940
Almost isn't good enough.

07:59.110 --> 08:00.280
( DISTANT THUNDER )

08:06.530 --> 08:07.740
General Fong?

08:07.830 --> 08:10.500
Come in, Aang.
Have you thought about our discussion?

08:12.660 --> 08:13.960
I'm in.

08:14.040 --> 08:15.290
I'll fight the Fire Lord.

08:27.890 --> 08:29.970
I told the general I'd help him

08:30.470 --> 08:32.390
by going into the Avatar state.

08:32.480 --> 08:34.940
Aang, no. This is not the right way.

08:35.020 --> 08:38.230
Why not? Remember when he took out
the fire navy? He was incredible.

08:38.730 --> 08:40.270
There's a right way to do this―

08:40.360 --> 08:42.190
Practice, study, and discipline.

08:42.280 --> 08:45.070
Or just glow it up
and stop that Fire Lord.

08:45.150 --> 08:48.780
If you two meatheads want to throw away
everything we've worked for, fine.

08:48.870 --> 08:50.280
Go ahead and glow it up.

08:50.490 --> 08:53.290
Katara, I'm just being realistic!

08:53.370 --> 08:55.790
I don't have time
to do this the right way.

09:01.170 --> 09:04.590
This rare chi-enhancing tea
is a natural stimulant.

09:05.220 --> 09:09.510
In an ordinary warrior,
it improves strength and energy tenfold.

09:09.930 --> 09:13.430
In you, it may induce the Avatar state.

09:13.730 --> 09:15.310
Tenfold energy, huh?

09:18.600 --> 09:20.020
Is it working? Is it working?

09:20.110 --> 09:22.780
I can't tell! Somebody tell me
if I'm in the Avatar state

09:22.860 --> 09:25.740
'Cause I don't have a good view
of myself. Am I talking loud?

09:25.820 --> 09:27.950
I guess he could talk
the Fire Lord to death.

09:28.530 --> 09:29.700
Uh!

09:31.830 --> 09:34.080
Maybe I can shock you
into the Avatar state.

09:34.540 --> 09:35.580
I love surprises.

09:37.710 --> 09:39.580
-( SCREECHES )
- Aah!

09:41.630 --> 09:42.840
Still not glowing.

09:43.050 --> 09:45.630
Uh! Uh! Aah!

09:49.840 --> 09:52.970
You are wearing a ceremonial
piece of clothing

09:53.060 --> 09:55.890
from each of the bending nations.

09:55.980 --> 09:59.600
Now, I will join
the four elements into one.

09:59.690 --> 10:05.530
Water, earth, fire, air!

10:05.610 --> 10:08.610
Four elements together as one.

10:10.240 --> 10:11.570
This is just mud.

10:11.660 --> 10:13.870
So, do you feel anything?

10:17.540 --> 10:19.120
( SNEEZES )

10:20.170 --> 10:21.750
We have to find a way.

10:25.210 --> 10:28.550
Look at these magnificent shells.

10:28.630 --> 10:32.220
I'll enjoy these keepsakes
for years to come.

10:32.300 --> 10:34.180
We don't need any more useless things.

10:34.560 --> 10:37.100
You forget,
we have to carry everything ourselves now.

10:37.180 --> 10:40.440
Hello, brother, uncle.

10:40.520 --> 10:42.270
What are you doing here?

10:42.360 --> 10:46.530
In my country, we exchange
a pleasant hello before asking questions.

10:46.900 --> 10:49.820
Have you become uncivilized
so soon, Zu Zu?

10:49.900 --> 10:51.240
Don't call me that.

10:51.700 --> 10:54.280
To what do we owe this honor?

10:54.370 --> 10:56.580
Hmm, must be a family trait.

10:56.660 --> 10:58.620
Both of you so quick to get to the point.

10:59.750 --> 11:01.710
I've come with a message from home.

11:01.790 --> 11:06.210
Father's changed his mind. Family is
suddenly very important to him.

11:06.300 --> 11:08.920
He's heard rumors
of plans to overthrow him―

11:09.010 --> 11:10.760
Treacherous plots.

11:11.180 --> 11:14.600
Family are the only ones
you can really trust.

11:15.850 --> 11:19.350
Father regrets your banishment.
He wants you home.

11:21.730 --> 11:26.230
Did you hear me? You should be happy,
excited, grateful.

11:26.320 --> 11:28.440
I just gave you great news.

11:28.530 --> 11:31.110
I'm sure your brother
simply needs a moment―

11:31.200 --> 11:32.320
Don't interrupt, uncle.

11:33.070 --> 11:34.820
I still haven't heard my thank you.

11:34.910 --> 11:37.740
I'm not a messenger.
I didn't have to come all this way.

11:38.240 --> 11:42.540
Father regrets? He wants me back?

11:42.750 --> 11:45.210
I can see you need time to take this in.

11:45.290 --> 11:48.170
I'll come to call on you tomorrow.
Good evening.

11:51.840 --> 11:54.220
KATARA: Can we talk about something?
AANG: Sure.

11:54.760 --> 11:56.930
Do you remember
when we were at the air temple

11:57.010 --> 11:58.890
and you found Monk Gyatso's skeleton?

11:59.310 --> 12:02.020
It must have been so horrible
and traumatic for you.

12:02.980 --> 12:05.940
I saw you get so upset
that you weren't even you anymore.

12:06.020 --> 12:11.110
I'm not saying the Avatar state
doesn't have incredible and helpful power.

12:11.190 --> 12:14.860
But you have to understand,
for the people who love you,

12:14.950 --> 12:18.120
watching you be in that much
rage and pain is really scary.

12:19.910 --> 12:21.910
I'm really glad you told me that,

12:22.710 --> 12:24.460
But I still need to do this.

12:24.540 --> 12:26.000
I don't understand.

12:26.080 --> 12:27.460
No, you don't.

12:27.880 --> 12:29.960
Every day, more and more people die.

12:30.050 --> 12:32.090
I'm already a hundred years late.

12:32.170 --> 12:35.050
Defeating the Fire Lord
is the only way to stop this war.

12:35.130 --> 12:36.890
I have to try it.

12:37.140 --> 12:39.430
I can't watch you do this to yourself.

12:39.510 --> 12:41.310
I'm not coming tomorrow.

12:42.220 --> 12:43.230
Good night.

12:43.310 --> 12:44.310
Good night.

12:46.650 --> 12:47.650
We're going home

12:48.110 --> 12:49.520
after three long years.

12:49.610 --> 12:50.900
It's unbelievable.

12:51.360 --> 12:53.650
It is unbelievable.

12:53.740 --> 12:56.740
I have never known my brother
to regret anything.

12:57.410 --> 12:59.030
Did you listen to Azula?

12:59.120 --> 13:01.490
Father's realized how important
family is to him.

13:01.580 --> 13:02.750
He cares about me.

13:03.250 --> 13:04.710
I care about you.

13:04.790 --> 13:07.830
I mean, if Ozai wants you back, well,

13:07.920 --> 13:11.000
I think it may not be
for the reasons you imagine.

13:11.090 --> 13:13.170
You don't know
how my father feels about me.

13:13.260 --> 13:14.510
You don't know anything.

13:14.590 --> 13:17.970
Zuko, I only meant that in our family,

13:18.340 --> 13:20.600
things are not always what they seem.

13:21.100 --> 13:23.390
I think you are exactly what you seem―

13:23.470 --> 13:26.480
A lazy, mistrustful, shallow old man

13:26.560 --> 13:28.900
who's always been jealous of his brother.

13:42.080 --> 13:43.290
Aah!

13:49.920 --> 13:52.040
Sokka, Sokka, wake up.

13:52.130 --> 13:53.340
Huh?

13:53.420 --> 13:56.380
I don't think we should be trying
to bring on the Avatar state.

13:56.840 --> 13:58.680
- You sure?
- Yes.

13:58.880 --> 14:00.010
Ok.

14:00.090 --> 14:01.970
Do you think the general will be mad?

14:02.300 --> 14:04.520
What can he say? You're the Avatar.

14:04.600 --> 14:05.850
Who knows better than you?

14:13.650 --> 14:14.730
Wait!

14:14.820 --> 14:16.820
Don't leave without me.

14:17.450 --> 14:20.110
Uncle, you've changed your mind.

14:20.200 --> 14:22.370
Family sticks together, right?

14:27.370 --> 14:28.830
We're finally going home.

14:34.920 --> 14:39.340
AANG: The thing is, I don't think we'll
ever be able to trigger it on purpose.

14:39.840 --> 14:41.180
So I guess that's it.

14:41.680 --> 14:43.430
Sure I can't change your mind?

14:43.760 --> 14:47.850
I'm sure. I can only reach the Avatar
state when I'm in genuine danger.

14:48.350 --> 14:51.810
I see. I was afraid you'd say that.

14:55.570 --> 14:56.610
Aang!

14:57.360 --> 14:58.860
( AANG YELLS )

15:03.950 --> 15:07.580
Men, attack the Avatar.

15:22.760 --> 15:24.140
What are you doing?

15:24.390 --> 15:26.260
I believe we are about to get results.

15:34.190 --> 15:37.690
I'm not your enemy. I won't fight you.

16:13.940 --> 16:15.690
You can't run forever!

16:16.110 --> 16:17.520
You can't fight forever.

16:35.620 --> 16:37.460
Brother, uncle,

16:37.880 --> 16:39.170
welcome.

16:40.380 --> 16:42.840
I'm so glad you decided to come.

16:43.630 --> 16:46.140
Are we ready to depart, your highness?

16:46.340 --> 16:48.680
Set our course for home, captain.

16:49.100 --> 16:50.350
Home.

16:50.760 --> 16:53.230
You heard the princess. Raise the anchors.

16:53.310 --> 16:55.100
We're taking the prisoners home.

16:57.730 --> 16:59.270
Your highness, I...

17:07.700 --> 17:08.780
You lied to me.

17:09.160 --> 17:10.830
Like I've never done that before.

17:13.450 --> 17:14.460
( YELLS )

17:14.540 --> 17:15.540
Aah!

17:18.330 --> 17:20.540
I wonder what crazy thing
they're trying now.

17:21.300 --> 17:22.920
( PURRS )

17:23.010 --> 17:24.340
( HEAVY THUDS )

17:24.420 --> 17:26.380
Maybe we should just make sure Aang's ok.

17:29.680 --> 17:30.930
What's going on?

17:31.010 --> 17:32.430
The general's gone crazy.

17:32.810 --> 17:35.520
He's trying to force Aang
into the Avatar state.

17:43.530 --> 17:45.860
Good bird-horse thingy.

17:53.330 --> 17:56.540
Maybe you can avoid me, but she can't.

18:08.590 --> 18:09.720
I can't move.

18:10.300 --> 18:11.550
Don't hurt her.

18:17.810 --> 18:19.140
Katara, no!

18:21.020 --> 18:23.190
Whoa!

18:24.780 --> 18:27.190
Stop this! You have to let her go.

18:27.280 --> 18:29.740
You could save her
if you were in the Avatar state.

18:30.160 --> 18:32.450
I'm trying. I'm trying.

18:32.910 --> 18:34.410
Aang, I'm sinking!

18:34.870 --> 18:36.540
I don't see glowing.

18:38.370 --> 18:40.170
Aah! Please.

18:40.620 --> 18:42.420
You don't need to do this.

18:42.500 --> 18:44.840
Apparently, I do.

18:46.300 --> 18:47.300
Aah!

18:51.970 --> 18:53.100
It worked.

18:53.180 --> 18:54.850
It worked!

19:00.560 --> 19:01.770
Aah!

19:15.450 --> 19:17.160
Zuko, let's go!

19:19.790 --> 19:21.330
Hyah! Hyah! Hyah...

19:25.460 --> 19:28.630
You know, father blames uncle
for the loss at the North Pole.

19:28.710 --> 19:32.510
And he considers you a miserable failure
for not finding the Avatar.

19:33.010 --> 19:34.550
Why would he want you back home,

19:34.640 --> 19:37.560
except to lock you up
where you can no longer embarrass him?

19:38.810 --> 19:40.100
( YELLING )

20:09.800 --> 20:11.220
Aah! Uh!

20:17.220 --> 20:20.770
Avatar Aang, can you hear me?

20:21.520 --> 20:23.390
Your friend is safe.

20:23.480 --> 20:26.020
It was just a trick
to trigger the Avatar state.

20:26.730 --> 20:28.270
And it worked!

20:50.670 --> 20:52.710
It's time you learned.

20:58.010 --> 21:01.060
The Avatar state is a defense mechanism

21:01.140 --> 21:06.980
designed to empower you with the skills
and knowledge of all the past Avatars.

21:07.060 --> 21:11.020
<i>The glow is the combination
of all your past lives</i>

21:11.780 --> 21:15.200
<i>focusing their energy through your body.</i>

21:18.620 --> 21:20.450
<i>In the Avatar state,</i>

21:20.780 --> 21:22.740
<i>you are at your most powerful...</i>

21:24.960 --> 21:28.130
But you're also at your most vulnerable.

21:28.210 --> 21:29.250
What do you mean?

21:29.330 --> 21:31.500
If you are killed in the Avatar state,

21:32.420 --> 21:35.720
The reincarnation cycle will be broken

21:35.800 --> 21:39.140
and the Avatar will cease to exist.

21:56.610 --> 22:01.030
I'm sorry, Katara. I hope you never
have to see me like that again.

22:01.120 --> 22:04.160
Ha! Are you joking?
That was almost perfect.

22:04.240 --> 22:07.460
We just have to find out a way
to control you when you're like that.

22:07.540 --> 22:08.960
You're out of your mind.

22:09.040 --> 22:11.840
I guess we'll figure it out
on the way to the Fire Nation.

22:13.250 --> 22:14.800
Anybody got a problem with that?

22:16.380 --> 22:19.300
Do you still want an escort to Omashu?

22:20.550 --> 22:21.850
I think we're all set.

22:27.020 --> 22:28.890
Anyone who harbors these traitors

22:28.980 --> 22:30.940
will face the wrath of the Fire Lord.

22:32.360 --> 22:34.690
There will be no place left to hide.

22:41.160 --> 22:42.820
I think we're safe here.
