00:31.298 --> 00:33.432
Ohh.

02:43.430 --> 02:45.364
          Help me out.

02:47.668 --> 02:51.436
         Come on, Mel,
    let's take another shot.

02:51.438 --> 02:52.738
            Oh, oh.

03:20.967 --> 03:24.303
              Hey.
      How's it going, man?

03:24.305 --> 03:25.637
             -Good.
          -Good, good.

03:25.639 --> 03:27.639
         -How are you?
         -Great, great.

03:29.809 --> 03:32.444
         -Young Daniel.
       -How are you, sir?

03:32.446 --> 03:35.347
   -Good, man. How you doing?
          -Good, good.

03:35.349 --> 03:37.082
             Whoo!

03:38.852 --> 03:40.052
- Whoops!

03:40.054 --> 03:41.987
        Is it all gone?

03:44.692 --> 03:46.558
         You are drunk.

03:46.560 --> 03:49.595
     I got a full cup now.

03:49.597 --> 03:51.396
      Mnh. Can you give me
          a ride home?

03:51.398 --> 03:52.764
      I didn't drive here.

03:52.766 --> 03:54.333
    I'm going to Dan's now.

03:54.335 --> 03:55.767
   That's okay, you can just
    drop me off on the way.

03:55.769 --> 03:57.069
         No, you're not
      on the way to Dan's.

03:57.071 --> 03:58.570
       You're on the way
          to my place.

03:58.572 --> 04:00.906
           Yes, I am.
            Please.

04:00.908 --> 04:02.574
      I mean, it would be
         so much easier

04:02.576 --> 04:04.443
   if I just lived with Dan.

04:04.445 --> 04:06.812
     Okay, well, fuck you.
  You're giving me a ride home

04:06.814 --> 04:08.747
     because there's no one
      else at this party.

04:11.585 --> 04:13.585
          So serious.
     Will you listen to me!

04:13.587 --> 04:14.820
       I'm trying to have
    a serious conversation.

04:14.822 --> 04:16.355
    You never listen to me.

04:16.357 --> 04:17.723
          -Oh, really?
      -I'm gonna marry Dan

04:17.725 --> 04:19.625
      and have his babies
      by the time I'm 26.

04:19.627 --> 04:21.493
    Oh, yeah? Well, does Dan
   know about this marriage?

04:21.495 --> 04:23.462
   Do you know -- Do you know
 how long we've been together?

04:23.464 --> 04:25.697
           -How long?
        -Are you ready?

04:28.469 --> 04:29.801
             Boom.

04:29.803 --> 04:32.471
       Six fuckin' years.

04:32.473 --> 04:33.672
             Shit!

04:33.674 --> 04:35.040
            I know!

05:15.716 --> 05:18.984
           Mnh. Mnh.

05:18.986 --> 05:21.453
            Oh, God.

05:21.455 --> 05:22.788
              Oh!

05:22.790 --> 05:23.989
       Oh, I missed you.

05:23.991 --> 05:25.257
            Mm-hmm.

05:27.727 --> 05:29.528
     Are you trying to take
        advantage of me?

05:29.530 --> 05:31.129
             Yeah.

05:31.131 --> 05:32.597
             Okay.

05:38.604 --> 05:40.505
      Shut up and kiss me.

05:40.507 --> 05:41.807
              Mmm.

05:41.809 --> 05:43.141
         -Drunk, drunk.
    -Shut -- I'm not drunk.

05:43.143 --> 05:44.743
    How much did you drink?

05:44.745 --> 05:46.778
    I didn't drink anything.

05:46.780 --> 05:48.947
    That's a bold-faced lie.

05:48.949 --> 05:50.782
"Bold-faced"?

05:50.784 --> 05:52.651
             Bold.

05:54.454 --> 05:55.921
   Tell me about your night.

05:55.923 --> 05:57.656
          Well, mmm...

05:57.658 --> 06:00.459
       You left me, so I
     hung out with Jessica

06:00.461 --> 06:01.960
     and she was making out
         with this guy.

06:01.962 --> 06:03.528
       That's very nice.

06:03.530 --> 06:04.896
       Yeah, and then...

06:04.898 --> 06:06.465
      The party was shit.

06:06.467 --> 06:07.866
         Everyone left.
         It was dying.

06:07.868 --> 06:11.103
     It was boring, so Jess
     asked for a ride home,

06:11.105 --> 06:12.637
   -I gave her a ride home --
          -You drove?

06:12.639 --> 06:14.139
        And then, I came
          to see you.

06:14.141 --> 06:15.574
        You drove here?

06:15.576 --> 06:16.975
        Yeah, it's fine.

06:16.977 --> 06:19.211
      What the fuck, Mel?
      Don't do that shit.

06:19.213 --> 06:20.679
        Shh! It's okay.

06:20.681 --> 06:22.047
        It's so stupid.
         It's not okay.

06:22.049 --> 06:23.749
    I wasn't -- I'm not even
        that drunk, Dan.

06:23.751 --> 06:25.684
     -You're <i> really</i> drunk.
     -I'm not really drunk.

06:25.686 --> 06:27.018
        Just promise me,
           next time,

06:27.020 --> 06:28.787
        you will call me
    if you're fucking drunk.

06:28.789 --> 06:30.489
           -Call you?
    -And you're not gonna be

06:30.491 --> 06:32.724
     an idiot and drive all
across town to drop Jessica off

06:32.726 --> 06:33.992
 -and then come back over here.
     -I wasn't the only one

06:33.994 --> 06:35.527
       who was drinking.
       You were drinking.

06:35.529 --> 06:36.828
    Stop. Can you keep your
      voice down, please?

06:36.830 --> 06:38.096
          My roommates
      are trying to sleep.

06:38.098 --> 06:39.965
    What, I'm gonna call you
        and wake you up?

06:39.967 --> 06:41.733
      No, you're sleeping.
    I'm perfectly capable --

06:41.735 --> 06:44.002
 It doesn't matter. Just don't
do it. Don't be a fucking idiot.

06:44.004 --> 06:45.203
             What?!

06:45.205 --> 06:46.772
          Don't do it.
          Just don't.

06:46.774 --> 06:48.106
             What?

06:48.108 --> 06:49.674
         Fuck you, man.

06:49.676 --> 06:52.144
     -Where are you going?
        -I'm going home,

06:52.146 --> 06:53.678
      'cause, apparently,
     I'm not welcome here.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.914
- How are you getting home?

06:55.916 --> 06:58.683
   Stop. You're not driving.
        -Don't touch me!

06:58.685 --> 07:00.685
    You're not gonna fucking
  drunk-drive right now, Mel.

07:00.687 --> 07:02.554
          Get off me!

07:02.556 --> 07:04.890
             Fuck.

07:04.892 --> 07:06.258
              Ow!

07:06.260 --> 07:09.227
      -What the fuck, Mel?
     -I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

07:09.229 --> 07:10.896
    Don't fucking touch me.

07:10.898 --> 07:13.799
           Oh! Fuck.

07:13.801 --> 07:16.635
         It hurts. Ow!

07:16.637 --> 07:18.103
              Hey.

07:27.648 --> 07:29.614
             Fuck!

07:31.050 --> 07:33.118
I'm sorry, Dan.
           I'm sorry.

07:38.258 --> 07:41.593
- Great, you're dressed.

07:41.595 --> 07:42.994
          Hi, I'm Dan.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.596
       Nice to meet you.

07:44.598 --> 07:45.864
            I'm Mel.
            Melanie.

07:45.866 --> 07:49.334
    Okay, all the hard work
         has been done.

07:49.336 --> 07:51.136
         It should heal
          on its own.

07:51.138 --> 07:52.838
         You don't even
     have to see a doctor.

07:52.840 --> 07:54.105
           All right.

07:54.107 --> 07:55.640
          Okay, great.

07:55.642 --> 07:57.742
    So how did this happen?

07:57.744 --> 08:01.279
             Um...

08:01.281 --> 08:02.914
           I tripped.

08:02.916 --> 08:05.083
     I just tripped and hit
     my head on my dresser.

08:05.085 --> 08:06.651
             Okay.

08:06.653 --> 08:09.721
   Okay, guys, that's pretty
    much all I need to know.

08:09.723 --> 08:12.958
       -Okay. Thank you.
      -All right. Thanks.

08:12.960 --> 08:16.761
           My shoes.

08:27.307 --> 08:30.642
              Hey.
         How you doing?

08:30.644 --> 08:31.943
            Yo, yo.

08:31.945 --> 08:33.211
     I pulled those records
          you wanted.

08:33.212 --> 08:34.980
             Cool.
           Thank you.

08:34.982 --> 08:37.249
   The shipping labels should
     be printing right now,

08:37.251 --> 08:39.284
     and if you could just
   get those all squared away

08:39.285 --> 08:40.784
         and send them
          to that list

08:40.787 --> 08:42.621
         of journalists
          I sent you.

08:42.623 --> 08:43.989
             Cool.
          You got it.

08:43.991 --> 08:46.725
Cool hat.

08:46.727 --> 08:48.293
           Thank you.

08:48.295 --> 08:50.028
           Hey, wait.
       You want a coffee?

08:50.030 --> 08:52.364
            -Coffee.
    -I need one really bad.

08:52.366 --> 08:54.132
          I feel that.

08:54.134 --> 08:55.700
            Perfect.

08:57.637 --> 08:59.704
       So what's the deal
     with your hat, anyway?

08:59.706 --> 09:01.706
       It's 100Â° outside.

09:05.311 --> 09:07.879
              -Ow.
          -Holy shit!

09:07.881 --> 09:10.949
--What happened?

09:10.951 --> 09:13.818
        I hit my head on
     my dresser last night.

09:13.820 --> 09:15.420
        Were you drunk,
         or something?

09:15.422 --> 09:17.188
              No.

09:17.190 --> 09:19.057
            No, no,
     but my girlfriend was.

09:19.059 --> 09:20.692
             What?

09:20.694 --> 09:22.794
     We got into this fight
    'cause she was drunk --

09:22.796 --> 09:26.298
   very, very, very drunk --
   and wanted to drive home.

09:26.300 --> 09:28.900
     So I was fighting her
 for her keys and hit my head.

09:28.902 --> 09:32.237
And she pushed you?

09:32.239 --> 09:34.673
       It wasn't that big
       of a deal, really.

09:34.675 --> 09:36.408
            Uh-huh.

09:38.177 --> 09:40.745
   I don't know, that sounds
       pretty fucked up.

09:43.182 --> 09:45.383
         Imagine if you
     had done that to her.

09:46.819 --> 09:48.019
         I don't know.

09:48.021 --> 09:49.754
      Did you bleed a lot?

09:49.756 --> 09:51.189
        Yeah, there was
        a lot of blood.

09:51.191 --> 09:53.258
    I spent the whole night
     in the emergency room.

09:53.260 --> 09:54.793
       It was really fun.

09:54.795 --> 09:56.861
          That sucks.

09:56.863 --> 09:59.764
    Well, a bunch of us are
     gonna go see that band

09:59.766 --> 10:01.333
      Fun Friends tonight.
       You want to come?

10:01.335 --> 10:02.734
           Oh, nice.

10:02.736 --> 10:03.935
    Yeah, Mark keeps talking
          about that.

10:03.937 --> 10:07.072
            Mm-hmm.
         Well, text me

10:07.074 --> 10:08.406
     if you want me to put
        you on the list.

10:08.408 --> 10:09.808
             Okay.

10:09.810 --> 10:12.377
       I have to go back
            to work.

10:12.379 --> 10:14.012
             Pshew.

10:14.014 --> 10:15.780
            Pew pew.

10:27.426 --> 10:29.294
         Good morning,
     ladies and gentlemen.

10:29.296 --> 10:30.729
         Good morning!

10:30.731 --> 10:33.231
        Are we all ready
     for a very great day?

10:33.233 --> 10:34.866
              Yes.

10:34.868 --> 10:37.235
   I see some of you peeking
     over into the corner.

10:37.237 --> 10:39.437
   -Is there somebody there?
             -Yes.

10:39.439 --> 10:41.072
        Are you curious
       about who that is?

10:41.074 --> 10:42.273
              Yes!

10:42.275 --> 10:44.009
    Yes? I hear some yeses.

10:44.011 --> 10:47.245
  So I would like to introduce
       to you Miss Clark.

10:47.247 --> 10:49.280
     Miss Clark is gonna be
     spending today with us

10:49.282 --> 10:51.916
  and she's gonna be spending
   a couple of weeks with us.

10:51.918 --> 10:54.185
    Can you all give a very,
   very warm welcome and say

10:54.187 --> 10:55.954
       "Hi, Miss Clark"?

10:55.956 --> 10:57.922
        Hi, Miss Clark!

10:57.924 --> 10:59.958
            Amazing.

10:59.960 --> 11:02.861
         So tell me --
    tell me about your plan.

11:02.863 --> 11:04.796
         Tell me about
    where you are in school

11:04.798 --> 11:06.097
   and what you're thinking.

11:06.099 --> 11:08.133
      Well, I just started
        my junior year,

11:08.135 --> 11:10.902
       so I got one more
      after this and then,

11:10.904 --> 11:12.170
        I'm gonna do it,
        I'm gonna teach.

11:12.172 --> 11:13.371
           -You are?
             -Yeah.

11:13.373 --> 11:14.906
     What are you thinking?

11:14.908 --> 11:17.275
       Do you want to do
     elementary education?

11:17.277 --> 11:18.977
    I think so, I really do.
      I just love the kids

11:18.979 --> 11:21.179
      and I love how open
        their minds are

11:21.181 --> 11:22.881
     at this age, you know?

11:22.883 --> 11:24.849
   Yeah, there's this flowing
    creativity all the time.

11:24.851 --> 11:26.885
     Exactly, and they just
          say things.

11:26.887 --> 11:28.987
   You were great with them.
  You were really good today.

11:30.056 --> 11:32.057
            Thanks.

11:32.059 --> 11:35.427
           Oh, uh-oh.
          There we go.

11:35.429 --> 11:38.096
       -Yeah! Beautiful.
 -Domino did not make cookies.

11:38.098 --> 11:40.065
 -Did Navador make you cookies?
              -No.

11:40.067 --> 11:41.966
       Who makes cookies?
      Topo makes cookies.

11:41.968 --> 11:43.168
Topo makes the cookies.

11:43.170 --> 11:44.502
    Dan, have you met Jess?

11:44.504 --> 11:46.171
     No, I haven't. I just
     saw the show tonight.

11:46.173 --> 11:48.206
        It was so good.
     You guys are amazing.

11:48.208 --> 11:49.474
            Awesome.
     Thank you for coming.

11:49.476 --> 11:50.942
       -Dan's our intern.
           -Oh, cool.

11:50.944 --> 11:52.177
       Have you ever had
           an intern?

11:52.179 --> 11:53.545
              No.
     That would be awesome.

11:53.547 --> 11:55.413
      Oh, my God, we need
     to get you an intern.

11:55.415 --> 11:57.449
             -Yeah.
    -Interns are incredible.

11:57.451 --> 11:59.050
        Will you do a me
            a favor?

11:59.052 --> 12:00.919
         Will you drink
    the rest of your drink?

12:00.921 --> 12:02.987
           -This one?
        -Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

12:02.989 --> 12:05.023
            Mm-hmm.

12:05.025 --> 12:06.591
       Did you see that?

12:06.593 --> 12:08.593
          -I saw that.
        -That's amazing.

12:08.595 --> 12:10.462
     He did that for free.

12:10.464 --> 12:11.930
    You got credit, though.

12:11.932 --> 12:14.065
     You got course credit
           for that.

12:14.067 --> 12:15.400
        Thank you, yeah.

12:15.402 --> 12:18.903
    So, um, Jess, your tour
        is winding down.

12:18.905 --> 12:21.473
   Yes, we are about to play
   our last show in Brooklyn.

12:21.475 --> 12:23.942
            Really?
       Where in Brooklyn?

12:23.944 --> 12:25.210
         The music hall
        of Williamsburg.

12:25.212 --> 12:28.146
       Oh, that's great.

12:28.148 --> 12:29.380
    We're so excited, yeah.

12:29.382 --> 12:31.916
  We've got -- We've got plans
         for Brooklyn.

12:31.918 --> 12:33.518
        We have designs
          on Brooklyn.

12:33.520 --> 12:34.919
             Cool.

12:34.921 --> 12:36.988
             Yeah.
    Can't say too much yet,

12:36.990 --> 12:38.323
       but the next time
    you come through there,

12:38.325 --> 12:40.291
- we'll take care of you.

12:40.293 --> 12:42.193
          Soon enough.
         Jess, come on.

12:42.195 --> 12:44.028
    I want to introduce you
         to some folks.

12:44.030 --> 12:45.230
       Nice to meet you.

12:45.232 --> 12:47.432
    Yeah, nice to meet you,
           too, Jess.

12:49.101 --> 12:52.003
              Mnh!
     I saw Dan at the show.

12:52.005 --> 12:54.405
     He was with all of the
   like record-label people.

12:54.407 --> 12:56.241
             Yeah.
       He didn't say hi.

12:56.243 --> 12:59.144
             What?

12:59.146 --> 13:03.381
Yeah, he was, like, in the back
 with them all, and...you know.

13:03.383 --> 13:06.384
     I mean, he waved, but,
     they're kind of weird.

13:06.386 --> 13:09.020
       They kind of just
        make me nervous.

13:09.022 --> 13:10.388
         -I don't know.
       -They're so weird.

13:10.390 --> 13:12.157
They make me feel
       so uncomfortable.

13:12.159 --> 13:14.192
  I'm so happy you said that.
       It's not just me.

13:14.194 --> 13:16.394
              -No.
         -That's weird.

13:16.396 --> 13:21.599
      Yeah, I saw him and
   I was like, "Hey, there."

13:21.601 --> 13:24.669
    You know, I don't know.

13:24.671 --> 13:27.005
     Hey, do you ever think
   about dating anybody else,

13:27.007 --> 13:28.206
        other than Dan?

13:28.208 --> 13:29.407
              No.

13:29.409 --> 13:31.109
        I mean, come on.

13:31.111 --> 13:33.144
         Come on, what?
           I'm happy.

13:33.146 --> 13:36.281
    Don't you ever feel like
      you're missing out?

13:36.283 --> 13:38.249
      You don't get bored?

13:38.251 --> 13:40.218
    -No, I don't get bored.
     -You've been with him
          for so long.

13:40.220 --> 13:42.153
        How do you keep
      things interesting?

13:42.155 --> 13:44.022
     Yeah, like do you ever
          watch porn?

13:45.225 --> 13:47.458
            -What?!
         -I'm serious!

13:47.460 --> 13:49.060
     You know, spice it up
         a little bit.

13:49.062 --> 13:50.428
              Hey!

13:50.430 --> 13:51.629
     She does have a point.

13:51.631 --> 13:53.765
          I'm kidding.
     You know I'm kidding.

13:55.267 --> 13:56.568
              Wow.

13:56.570 --> 13:58.937
         Are you good?

13:58.939 --> 14:02.173
            Ahhhhhh!

14:02.175 --> 14:04.976
     Did you tell 'em where
   all the bodies are buried?

14:04.978 --> 14:07.378
         Oh, right. Oh.

14:07.380 --> 14:08.580
          Cheers, guy.

14:08.582 --> 14:10.281
            Cheers.

14:10.283 --> 14:13.585
              So.

14:13.587 --> 14:15.053
              So.

14:15.055 --> 14:17.288
         You want to do
     the lanterns for Jess?

14:17.290 --> 14:19.190
    Fuck, yeah, I want to do
     the lanterns for Jess.

14:19.192 --> 14:20.725
    You are gonna love this.

14:20.727 --> 14:23.328
    Go round up the troops.
     We'll be out in five.

14:28.500 --> 14:29.968
     Thanks for inviting me
           over, man.

14:29.970 --> 14:31.236
       I'm glad you came.

14:31.238 --> 14:33.671
        Having a blast.

14:33.673 --> 14:35.540
         Um, so tell me
        about Dog Water.

14:35.542 --> 14:38.409
        Did you give it
           a listen?

14:38.411 --> 14:40.111
      I gave it a listen.

14:40.113 --> 14:41.546
    Yeah, I mean, you know,

14:41.548 --> 14:43.715
    they were playing a lot
  of shows that I was going to

14:43.717 --> 14:46.284
    and they just graduated
           last year,

14:46.286 --> 14:47.652
  but they're sticking around.

14:47.654 --> 14:50.154
     I know they're fucking
       working at it, so.

14:50.156 --> 14:52.690
   I want you to keep an eye
     on them for me, okay?

14:52.692 --> 14:54.626
           Every time
     they record something,

14:54.628 --> 14:57.662
  if they're playing out live,
       you come grab me,

14:57.664 --> 14:59.063
     I'll go check 'em out
           with you.

14:59.065 --> 15:00.632
             Cool.

15:00.634 --> 15:02.133
        Let's go set off
       some motherfuckin'

15:02.135 --> 15:04.235
       Chinese lanterns!

15:16.181 --> 15:18.583
             Shit.
      Thank you very much.

15:42.708 --> 15:46.244
            <i> Oh, hey.</i>

15:46.246 --> 15:49.180
       <i> I don't want to be</i>
     <i> on camera and eating.</i>

15:49.182 --> 15:51.115
     <i> So what? You look cute</i>
         <i> with no pants.</i>

15:51.117 --> 15:54.085
      <i> 'Cause I'm at home.</i>

16:03.263 --> 16:05.163
             <i> Yeah!</i>

16:05.165 --> 16:08.132
  <i> Guess what -- I'm a fuckin'</i>
      <i> filthy fuckin' slut.</i>

16:08.134 --> 16:09.334
           <i> Yeah. Mmm.</i>

16:13.340 --> 16:15.440
Hi-i. How are you?

16:15.442 --> 16:17.809
I'm <i> really</i> drunk.

16:20.612 --> 16:23.181
        Someone had fun.

16:23.183 --> 16:25.516
 Mm-hmm. I gotta show you this
   band Mark just showed me.

16:25.518 --> 16:27.118
      No, not another one.

16:27.120 --> 16:28.386
     You're gonna like it.
     You're gonna like it.

16:28.388 --> 16:30.388
      No, I'm sure I will.
       Play it tomorrow.

16:30.390 --> 16:32.190
          What's your
        fuckin' problem?

16:32.192 --> 16:33.658
      -Tomorrow. Come on.
    -Let me play it for you.

16:33.660 --> 16:36.227
     Just play it tomorrow.

16:36.229 --> 16:37.795
         Dan, come on.

16:37.797 --> 16:40.565
      You're being weird.

16:40.567 --> 16:44.369
          See, look --

16:44.371 --> 16:47.805
--What the fuck?

16:47.807 --> 16:49.741
         What the fuck?

16:51.811 --> 16:53.244
        You watch porn?

16:53.246 --> 16:54.612
   Were you just about to...?
              Oh!

16:54.614 --> 16:56.180
      Just about to what?

16:57.384 --> 16:58.616
         No, I don't --

16:58.618 --> 17:00.251
       They said they --

17:00.253 --> 17:02.420
    They said you were gonna
  get bored, so I just -- I --

17:02.422 --> 17:05.223
          Your friends
         are so stupid.

17:07.827 --> 17:10.228
       Do you watch porn?

17:10.230 --> 17:11.796
             Uh...

17:11.798 --> 17:14.298
           Sometimes.

17:16.702 --> 17:19.137
         -You watch --
    -No shit, I watch porn.
          I'm a dude.

17:19.138 --> 17:21.539
          -Oh, my God.
     -Does that bother you?

17:22.574 --> 17:24.642
   Are you bored during sex?

17:24.644 --> 17:26.844
No.

17:26.846 --> 17:28.413
         Are <i> you</i> bored?

17:28.415 --> 17:30.314
No!

17:30.316 --> 17:31.916
       Just relax, okay?

17:31.918 --> 17:33.384
   If you want to watch porn,
       we can watch porn.

17:33.386 --> 17:34.752
       It might be weird.

17:34.754 --> 17:36.487
       Mnh-mnh. I'm good.

17:36.489 --> 17:39.557
        It might be fun.

17:43.862 --> 17:45.730
             What?

17:47.733 --> 17:50.368
              No.

17:50.370 --> 17:53.905
           All right.

17:55.574 --> 17:58.176
     I'm gonna go wash up.

18:07.186 --> 18:08.786
        So what'd you do
           at Mark's?

18:08.788 --> 18:11.255
         It was so fun.

18:11.257 --> 18:13.224
  You should've come with me.

18:13.226 --> 18:15.226
     You would've had fun.
    It was like a big party.

18:15.228 --> 18:16.427
            Mm-hmm.

18:16.429 --> 18:17.929
    And the band was there.
            So good.

18:17.931 --> 18:19.630
  And then Mark is definitely
        gonna sign them.

18:19.632 --> 18:20.832
        And guess what.

18:20.834 --> 18:22.366
What?

18:24.871 --> 18:29.373
       Um, Amanda told me
        that they don't,

18:29.375 --> 18:31.776
        um, keep interns
      for more than a year

18:31.778 --> 18:34.378
      if they're not gonna
        hire them, so...

18:34.380 --> 18:36.214
            Really?

18:36.216 --> 18:37.849
         -Yeah, but --
     -Wait, she said that?

18:37.851 --> 18:39.951
   I mean, yeah, but she just
      said that, I mean --

18:39.953 --> 18:43.287
    Well, she wouldn't <i> just</i>
         say it, right?

18:43.289 --> 18:45.990
          I'm hoping.
         I don't know.

18:45.992 --> 18:47.892
        She's my friend,
    so she's hoping for me.

18:47.894 --> 18:49.360
    We'll see what happens.

18:49.362 --> 18:51.996
        That's awesome.
    That's fucking awesome.

18:51.998 --> 18:53.998
            Mm-hmm.

18:54.000 --> 18:56.567
              Ugh.

18:56.569 --> 18:58.536
          Don't smoke.

18:58.538 --> 19:00.538
     It's not good for you,
         'cause, then,

19:00.540 --> 19:02.406
         I'm not gonna
       kiss you anymore.

19:02.408 --> 19:04.442
         You don't like
          kissing me?

19:04.444 --> 19:07.745
              No.

19:07.747 --> 19:11.449
    Except for when you wear
         the cat pants.

19:11.451 --> 19:13.885
     The cat pajama pants.
       This is very hot.

19:13.887 --> 19:15.753
      Where'd you get this
      little outfit, hmm,

19:15.755 --> 19:17.622
          some sort of
        lingerie store?

19:19.292 --> 19:20.491
            Really?

19:20.493 --> 19:22.393
        Yeah, I like it.

19:22.395 --> 19:24.695
      You look real fine.

19:40.913 --> 19:42.680
     How are your classes?

19:42.682 --> 19:43.948
         They're good.

19:43.950 --> 19:46.918
     I'm really sort of...

19:46.920 --> 19:49.587
      Getting senioritis,
     you know what I mean?

19:49.589 --> 19:51.689
       Done with school.
   I just want to be working.

19:51.691 --> 19:54.525
     But the internship is
         going so well.

19:54.527 --> 19:55.993
             -Good.
  -I'm just learning so much.

19:55.995 --> 19:59.864
      Everybody is really
       gifted over there.

19:59.866 --> 20:02.500
     Hopefully, there'll be
     a job when I graduate.

20:02.502 --> 20:04.302
     No one's said anything
          yet, but --

20:04.304 --> 20:07.038
     There are some labels
          in New York

20:07.040 --> 20:09.674
      that I'm interested
            in, but,

20:09.676 --> 20:11.676
     I have to be here next
     year for Mel, anyway,

20:11.678 --> 20:13.811
        so I think it's
      gonna work out well.

20:13.813 --> 20:15.947
      Timing will be good.

20:15.949 --> 20:17.548
     Well, you know, I know
    we haven't really talked

20:17.550 --> 20:19.884
          about this,
     but I want you to know

20:19.886 --> 20:23.621
    that your father and I,
     we'd like to help you,

20:23.623 --> 20:24.956
          if you want
        to leave Texas.

20:24.958 --> 20:26.591
     We would pay your rent
      and your expenses --

20:26.593 --> 20:27.858
            Really?

20:27.860 --> 20:29.827
       For a few months,
     'til you got settled,

20:29.829 --> 20:31.529
     like we did with your
        brother, and --

20:31.531 --> 20:32.730
            Hi-i-i!

20:32.732 --> 20:34.732
              -Hi.
              -Hi!

20:34.734 --> 20:37.468
        -Sorry I'm late.
      -It's okay. Sweetie!

20:37.470 --> 20:39.503
     I had to wait 'til all
  the kids got picked up. Hi.

20:39.505 --> 20:40.705
              Hey.

20:40.707 --> 20:42.373
              Ooh.

20:42.375 --> 20:44.075
        What's going on?

20:44.077 --> 20:46.043
           Not much.
         I'm starving.

20:46.045 --> 20:47.645
             -Yeah.
             -Good.

20:47.647 --> 20:48.980
        Everything okay?

20:48.982 --> 20:50.381
             Yeah.

20:50.383 --> 20:51.649
             Great.

20:51.651 --> 20:54.452
           Very good.

20:54.454 --> 20:56.954
      Honestly, you know,
     every time we talked,

20:56.956 --> 20:59.457
 I told your mom that I thought
  she should sell that house,

20:59.459 --> 21:02.026
  even though the real-estate
   market was crap, you know.

21:02.028 --> 21:04.462
      Yeah, I don't know.
       So many memories.

21:04.464 --> 21:06.897
       I can't even deal
            with it.

21:06.899 --> 21:08.866
            I know.
       Makes me sad, too.

21:08.868 --> 21:11.769
    I'm gonna miss her being
        right next door.

21:11.771 --> 21:13.971
           -You know?
          -I love you.

21:13.973 --> 21:15.573
             -Bye.
       -Thanks for lunch.

21:15.575 --> 21:17.975
        -Okay, sweetie.
             -Bye!

21:30.689 --> 21:32.823
             -What?
    -Amanda just texted me.

21:32.825 --> 21:34.759
   Everybody's at the condos.

21:34.761 --> 21:36.027
          Sounds fun.

21:36.029 --> 21:37.928
      I don't want to go.
      The pool's so nasty.

21:37.930 --> 21:39.630
         What the fuck?

21:39.632 --> 21:41.766
    You were just saying how
   badly you want to go out.

21:41.768 --> 21:43.000
       Now you don't want
             to go.

21:43.002 --> 21:44.435
           Not there.

21:44.437 --> 21:46.170
           -Why <i> not?</i>
   -I don't want to go there.

21:46.172 --> 21:48.639
              Why?
    Give me one good reason.

21:48.641 --> 21:50.908
  -Because I don't want to go.
   -That's not a good reason.

21:50.910 --> 21:53.444
  And I have nothing to wear.
     I can't go like this.

21:53.446 --> 21:55.146
    Why not? Why do you need
        a fucking outfit

21:55.148 --> 21:57.048
           for every
      different occasion?

21:57.050 --> 21:59.183
      I'm not gonna go see
     all those record-label
    people and go like this.

21:59.185 --> 22:01.819
 Who do you think these people
are? You think they give a shit?

22:01.821 --> 22:03.487
      They're all gonna be
     really drunk, anyway.

22:03.489 --> 22:05.189
         Let's just go
      and have a good time

22:05.191 --> 22:06.657
      and get the fuck out
         of this house.

22:06.659 --> 22:08.192
            Please.

22:08.194 --> 22:09.760
    I have school tomorrow.

22:09.762 --> 22:12.663
     Since when do you give
      a shit about school?

22:12.665 --> 22:15.433
  I give a shit about school.
       What do you mean?

22:15.435 --> 22:16.701
      I have better grades
           than you.

22:16.703 --> 22:18.436
          We're going.
        Today's the day.

22:18.438 --> 22:19.704
      -It's gonna happen.
           -Mnh-mnh.

22:19.706 --> 22:22.073
          -Yes, it is!
              -No!

22:22.075 --> 22:23.974
           -Come on.
         -For how long?

22:23.976 --> 22:26.944
     One drink. One drink,
           and if you

22:26.946 --> 22:29.880
   are hating the experience,
         we can leave.

22:29.882 --> 22:32.583
     And that's a promise.

22:32.585 --> 22:35.219
            Please.
        I'm going crazy.

22:35.221 --> 22:37.788
      I have cabin fever.

22:37.790 --> 22:40.157
      -I'm gonna kill you.
           -Ah! Stop.

22:40.159 --> 22:42.126
        You're so heavy.

22:42.128 --> 22:43.861
         So, can we go?

22:43.863 --> 22:46.163
         Say "please."

22:46.165 --> 22:49.233
       Please, can we go?

22:49.235 --> 22:50.801
     Fine, but you owe me.

22:50.803 --> 22:53.070
Yes, yes. Yes.

22:53.072 --> 22:55.172
    All right, let's do it.
           Let's go.

22:55.174 --> 22:56.807
    You owe me. I'm serious.
         Like bigtime.

22:56.809 --> 22:59.577
     Okay, really, whatever
     you want, you got it.

22:59.579 --> 23:02.713
     You just made my day.

23:02.715 --> 23:04.982
    Oh, you gotta carry me.

23:04.984 --> 23:06.851
     Okay, I'm getting up.
        I'm getting up.

23:06.853 --> 23:08.052
           Ah-oh-oh!

23:12.491 --> 23:14.525
            Help me.

23:14.527 --> 23:16.060
        Milady. Come on.

23:16.862 --> 23:19.730
          You got it?

23:19.732 --> 23:22.133
         Dan! Whoo-hoo!

23:22.135 --> 23:24.201
          Whoo-oo-oo!

23:24.203 --> 23:25.603
             Danny!

23:25.605 --> 23:27.004
        Danny, come on.

23:27.006 --> 23:28.606
       You're really not
         gonna come in?

23:28.608 --> 23:30.875
              No.

23:30.877 --> 23:32.810
              -Hi!
        -That's Amanda.

23:32.812 --> 23:34.011
              Hi.

23:34.013 --> 23:35.613
        Get in, get in.

23:35.615 --> 23:37.181
       Dan's girlfriend,
   come on, get in the pool.

23:37.183 --> 23:38.682
          Yes, do it.

23:38.684 --> 23:40.084
          Whoo-oo-oo!

23:41.287 --> 23:43.654
     Can you get me a beer?

23:43.656 --> 23:44.922
       You got it, yeah.

23:44.924 --> 23:46.257
          Dan, get us
         a lot of beer.

23:46.259 --> 23:47.658
      Just keep it coming.

23:47.660 --> 23:49.927
             -Hey.
              -Hi.

23:49.929 --> 23:51.729
          How are ya?

23:51.731 --> 23:52.997
         I'm all right.

23:52.999 --> 23:56.167
      Um, are we gonna go?

23:56.169 --> 23:58.536
           Right now?

23:58.538 --> 24:00.137
      You said one drink.

24:00.139 --> 24:01.539
              Oh.

24:01.541 --> 24:02.840
     You're not having fun?

24:02.842 --> 24:05.976
   I'm just tired of dealing.
            School.

24:05.978 --> 24:07.211
         I understand.
           I just --

24:07.213 --> 24:09.847
   I feel like it's important
         that I'm here

24:09.849 --> 24:12.149
       with these people.

24:12.151 --> 24:13.818
      For work, you know?

24:13.820 --> 24:15.052
             Yeah.

24:15.054 --> 24:17.588
      That's cool. I mean,
       you stay, I'll go.

24:17.590 --> 24:19.824
           -You sure?
       -Yeah, it's fine.

24:19.826 --> 24:22.560
      Can you just text me
       when you get home,

24:22.562 --> 24:25.629
     so I know you're safe?
          I love you.

24:25.631 --> 24:27.131
          I love you.

24:28.967 --> 24:31.402
          See ya, kid.

24:32.704 --> 24:35.105
       Oh, look at them!

24:35.107 --> 24:36.340
       Shut the fuck up.

24:39.846 --> 24:42.346
     Are you gonna get in?

24:42.348 --> 24:43.881
            Come on,
       let's go swimming!

24:43.883 --> 24:45.182
        Come on, get in.

24:45.184 --> 24:46.650
            Come on,
       let's go swimming.

24:46.652 --> 24:49.820
          I gotta go.
       Sorry, I gotta go.

24:49.822 --> 24:51.088
            But nice
       to meet you guys.

24:51.090 --> 24:53.224
         It was so nice
          to meet you!

24:53.226 --> 24:55.893
      -Have a good night.
             -Bye!

25:16.615 --> 25:17.882
          Do you think
      we're gonna get sick

25:17.884 --> 25:19.216
      because of how Mark
      threw up in the pool

25:19.218 --> 25:20.751
only about three weeks
         ago?

25:20.753 --> 25:23.787
        I totally forgot
          about that.

25:23.789 --> 25:25.055
       A lot of hot dogs.

25:25.057 --> 25:26.991
   Projectile-vomit hot dogs.

25:26.993 --> 25:29.193
         -15 hot dogs.
     -Just whole hot dogs.

25:29.195 --> 25:30.394
          Sliding in.

25:33.866 --> 25:35.165
        It was horrible.

25:35.167 --> 25:38.702
       It was impressive.
   I was -- I was impressed.

25:38.704 --> 25:40.271
        Yeah, no wonder
        your girlfriend

25:40.273 --> 25:41.839
          didn't want
      to hang out with us.

25:44.277 --> 25:45.676
    No, but why did she go?

25:45.678 --> 25:46.911
         She has class
        in the morning.

25:46.913 --> 25:48.245
             Yeah?

25:48.247 --> 25:49.947
  I mean, I have fucking class
      in the morning, too,

25:49.949 --> 25:53.817
    but she's a good student
     and I'm just a fuckup.

25:53.819 --> 25:56.153
             -Yeah.
      -I'm just fucked up.

25:56.155 --> 25:58.322
     How long have you guys
         been together?

25:58.324 --> 25:59.723
            6 years.

25:59.725 --> 26:01.692
Whew!

26:01.694 --> 26:04.061
         What is that?
            "Whew!"

26:04.063 --> 26:06.931
     Everyone says, "Wow,"
            "whoa."

26:06.933 --> 26:08.666
       'Cause it's really
          a long time.

26:09.869 --> 26:11.068
            I know.

26:11.070 --> 26:12.336
      Wait, does that mean
          that she is

26:12.338 --> 26:14.138
      the only girl you've
       ever had sex with?

26:14.140 --> 26:16.373
--What?

26:16.375 --> 26:18.876
             Uh...

26:18.878 --> 26:20.444
       Well, well, well.

26:20.446 --> 26:24.448
    Wait, uh, can I ask you
      a personal question?

26:24.450 --> 26:27.151
        When you've been
        seeing somebody

26:27.153 --> 26:30.854
      for that many years,
   is the sex still any good

26:30.856 --> 26:32.723
        or is it, like,
         pretty boring?

26:32.725 --> 26:35.793
    Don't even ask me that,
          please. I --

26:35.795 --> 26:38.729
      There's no way to --
          just don't.

26:38.731 --> 26:41.265
   Oh, I've just been single
          for so long

26:41.267 --> 26:44.068
   that I cannot even <i> imagine</i>
         what it's like

26:44.070 --> 26:47.071
        to be with, like
        in a long-term,

26:47.073 --> 26:51.709
     one-person, committed.

26:51.711 --> 26:53.777
        Just don't know.

26:53.779 --> 26:55.112
        I really can't.

26:55.114 --> 26:56.714
I really can't.

26:56.716 --> 26:58.816
           You know?

26:58.818 --> 27:01.051
      Wait, I'm just gonna
       speak freely here.

27:01.053 --> 27:02.286
       Just speak freely.

27:02.288 --> 27:03.487
             Okay.

27:03.489 --> 27:05.889
       The thing is that,

27:05.891 --> 27:07.358
            when --
  whenever I'm dating anyone,

27:07.360 --> 27:11.028
       even if it's like
     for like three months

27:11.030 --> 27:14.231
          or a month,
       or even a week --

27:14.233 --> 27:18.502
       I just like, I get
    so addicted to the sex.

27:18.504 --> 27:21.271
     All I can think about,
         all the time.

27:21.273 --> 27:23.140
          I can't get
         anything done.

27:24.443 --> 27:26.977
       I become terrible
     at my job. Seriously.

27:26.979 --> 27:28.312
           And then,
        when I'm single,

27:28.314 --> 27:32.182
   I just pretty much forget
        that sex exists

27:32.184 --> 27:33.417
altogether.

27:33.419 --> 27:35.419
          Really? Wow.

27:35.421 --> 27:37.388
            -I know.
             -Whoa.

27:37.390 --> 27:38.856
              Oh.

27:43.094 --> 27:44.528
        I don't know why
        I told you that.

27:47.533 --> 27:49.166
             Brrr!

27:52.437 --> 27:55.005
           I'm cold.

27:59.177 --> 28:00.844
            Oh, God.

28:02.948 --> 28:04.248
             Fuck.

28:04.250 --> 28:06.150
     I'm sorry I did that.

28:06.152 --> 28:07.384
          That's okay.

28:07.386 --> 28:08.786
       -I'm really sorry.
         -That's okay.

28:08.788 --> 28:10.054
         I don't know.
         I don't know.

28:10.056 --> 28:11.321
         No, it's okay.
           It's okay.

28:11.323 --> 28:13.857
         -I'm so sorry.
      -It's totally okay.

28:13.859 --> 28:15.159
     -Fuck. I'm so stupid.
             -Dan.

28:15.161 --> 28:17.428
     Real smooth, you know?
             Fuck!

28:17.430 --> 28:19.029
           It's okay.

28:19.031 --> 28:21.265
    It's not like I haven't
    thought about it before.

28:21.267 --> 28:23.033
           It's fine.

28:23.035 --> 28:25.502
Look, I like -- really like you,
     but I really like you

28:25.504 --> 28:27.571
       as a friend and I,
   you know, I don't think --

28:27.573 --> 28:30.841
      I don't want things
     to get too confusing.

28:30.843 --> 28:32.042
         Yeah, totally.

28:32.044 --> 28:33.410
     It's fine. We're fine.

28:33.412 --> 28:35.145
      We're friends, yeah?

28:35.147 --> 28:36.814
             Yeah.

28:38.017 --> 28:39.516
    Okay, I'm gonna go now.

28:39.518 --> 28:41.185
             -Yeah.
             -Yeah.

28:41.187 --> 28:42.920
           All right.

29:24.129 --> 29:26.296
            Mmm. Hi.

29:30.869 --> 29:32.603
     You got me breakfast?

29:32.605 --> 29:34.605
            Mm-hmm.

29:34.607 --> 29:39.543
      Wait, why didn't you
   come back here last night?

29:39.545 --> 29:42.012
        I had texted you
    and you didn't respond.

29:42.014 --> 29:44.047
         I didn't want
        to wake you up.

29:44.049 --> 29:45.315
         Are you going
      to the record label?

29:45.317 --> 29:47.551
            Mm-hmm,
       but I don't think

29:47.553 --> 29:49.386
     they're gonna need me
      for that long, so...

29:49.388 --> 29:51.021
             Okay.

29:51.023 --> 29:52.422
      Can we hang out when
    you're done with class?

29:52.424 --> 29:54.458
            Mm-hmm.

29:57.162 --> 29:58.529
              Hey,

29:58.531 --> 30:01.465
     was that party any fun
    last night after I left?

30:01.467 --> 30:03.667
       No, it was stupid.

30:03.669 --> 30:05.235
        I should've just
         left with you.

30:05.237 --> 30:07.271
Obviously.

30:09.074 --> 30:11.141
     Thanks for bringing me
           breakfast.

30:13.244 --> 30:15.679
        You're so sweet.

30:15.681 --> 30:17.481
     Why are you the best?

30:17.483 --> 30:19.550
         I don't know.

30:19.552 --> 30:21.318
              Hmm.

30:28.259 --> 30:30.227
          I gotta go.

30:33.932 --> 30:35.599
         What's wrong?

30:35.601 --> 30:39.336
            Nothing.

30:39.338 --> 30:41.638
        What's going on?

30:41.640 --> 30:45.576
            Nothing.

30:45.578 --> 30:47.511
            Nothing.

31:26.151 --> 31:29.019
         So, you know,
      how was your night?

31:29.021 --> 31:30.454
              Oh.

31:30.456 --> 31:31.722
           The lady.
       What was her name?

31:31.724 --> 31:33.123
           Michelle.

31:33.125 --> 31:34.391
        Oh, it was good.

31:34.393 --> 31:36.093
       We went to dinner
         and I took her

31:36.095 --> 31:38.262
          to a movie,
       that whole thing,

31:38.264 --> 31:39.630
     and then, we had sex.

31:41.233 --> 31:43.500
          Nice, dude.
         You got laid.

31:43.502 --> 31:45.202
             Yeah.
       Yeah, I got laid.

31:45.204 --> 31:46.536
         "We had sex."

31:46.538 --> 31:48.438
      -Was it a nice date?
       -It was very nice.

31:48.440 --> 31:50.741
      You gonna call her?

31:50.743 --> 31:52.175
             Um...

31:52.177 --> 31:53.443
        Was she a babe?

31:53.445 --> 31:55.479
     Was she a smoke show?

31:55.481 --> 31:57.414
             -Stop!
  -She was quite a smoke show.

31:57.416 --> 31:59.049
         Where's Becca?

31:59.051 --> 32:00.550
  I don't know. I called her.
       She didn't answer.

32:00.552 --> 32:02.152
       You got pictures?

32:02.154 --> 32:04.354
    Wait, why the fuck isn't
     Becca here right now?

32:04.356 --> 32:06.523
  Why -- Why isn't Becca here?

32:06.525 --> 32:07.791
          Mnh-mnh-mnh.

32:07.793 --> 32:10.060
         Hold on. Shh!
     Fuck, my phone's dead.

32:10.062 --> 32:11.361
    Can I borrow your phone?

32:11.363 --> 32:12.562
            Mm-hmm.

32:12.564 --> 32:14.498
       Where is it -- oh.
         It's in there?

32:14.500 --> 32:15.832
              Yes.
          You got it.

32:39.724 --> 32:41.325
     Where the fuck is Dan?

32:41.327 --> 32:42.759
What?

32:42.761 --> 32:44.361
  I think he went over there.
       What's the matter?

32:46.397 --> 32:48.565
          Here's your
         fucking phone.

32:48.567 --> 32:51.201
             Uh...

32:51.203 --> 32:52.602
           Hey, Mel?

32:52.604 --> 32:54.071
              Mel?

32:54.073 --> 32:55.372
              Mel.

32:55.374 --> 32:57.074
     Mel, what's going on?

32:57.076 --> 32:58.342
        Mel. What's up?

32:58.344 --> 32:59.843
        Amanda, really?

32:59.845 --> 33:01.478
          What are you
         talking about?

33:01.480 --> 33:02.746
I can't --

33:02.748 --> 33:05.082
     Mel, what's going on?

33:05.084 --> 33:07.184
           Stop. Stop
      fucking pushing me.

33:07.186 --> 33:09.319
         Fuck you. Agh!

33:09.321 --> 33:11.488
        Don't touch me!

33:11.490 --> 33:12.689
      Just don't touch me.

33:15.194 --> 33:16.426
              Mel.

33:16.428 --> 33:17.627
       Mel, why don't you
        just talk to me

33:17.629 --> 33:19.129
          and tell me
        what's going on?

33:19.131 --> 33:21.398
      What the fuck, Dan?
        You kissed her.

33:21.400 --> 33:22.666
        You kissed her.

33:22.668 --> 33:25.469
      <i> She</i> kissed <i> me,</i> okay?

33:25.471 --> 33:27.337
       And I didn't think
       it was a big deal.

33:27.339 --> 33:28.705
     I should've told you.
       It was a mistake,

33:28.707 --> 33:30.140
         but I just --
        it was nothing.

33:30.142 --> 33:31.375
           That's why
       I didn't tell you.

33:31.377 --> 33:34.111
     I said don't touch me!

33:34.113 --> 33:36.680
Why don't you just listen to me,
      okay? It was not --

33:36.682 --> 33:37.881
             What?

33:37.883 --> 33:39.349
         I didn't think
       it mattered, okay?

33:39.351 --> 33:40.784
          It was just
       a stupid mistake.

33:40.786 --> 33:42.252
   Then you would've told me!
      You would've told me

33:42.254 --> 33:43.687
    this morning, but you're
        a fucking liar.

33:43.689 --> 33:47.724
         Because <i> you</i> --
        you kissed her!

33:47.726 --> 33:49.393
        You kissed her!

33:49.395 --> 33:50.594
You kissed her!

33:50.596 --> 33:51.862
             Fuck.

33:54.499 --> 33:56.466
        Mel, I'm sorry.

33:56.468 --> 33:57.801
       I fucked up, okay?

33:57.803 --> 33:59.269
      I'm sorry, but I'll
    never do it again, okay?

33:59.271 --> 34:00.537
       -Did you fuck her?
          -I love you.

34:00.539 --> 34:02.706
      Answer the question.
       Did you fuck her?

34:02.708 --> 34:04.174
       I didn't fuck her.

34:04.176 --> 34:05.442
     Yeah, but you want to.

34:05.444 --> 34:07.644
      -Stop it! All right?
         -You want to!

34:07.646 --> 34:09.646
     Stop it! Fucking stop
     hitting me, all right?

34:09.648 --> 34:11.380
         Ow! Fuck you!

34:12.717 --> 34:15.284
          Get off me!

34:15.286 --> 34:16.553
    Get away from the girl!

34:16.554 --> 34:18.388
    Get away from the girl!
           Step away.

34:18.389 --> 34:20.791
       Get on the ground!
       Get on the ground!

34:20.793 --> 34:22.559
   You, over there! Put your
    hands behind your back.

34:22.561 --> 34:24.261
 I just thought we were coming
    here to bust up a party.

34:24.263 --> 34:26.563
          Do you have
      any weapons on you?

34:26.565 --> 34:28.598
        -Do you have any
        weapons on you?!
              -No!

34:28.600 --> 34:32.569
 -What are you doing here, huh?
   -I wasn't doing anything.

34:34.639 --> 34:36.273
          Mel, please!

34:36.275 --> 34:38.208
       You been drinkin'
            tonight?

34:38.210 --> 34:41.210
            Get up!

34:41.213 --> 34:42.913
      Mel, say something!

34:42.915 --> 34:46.550
      Keep them separated.
         Keep her down!

34:46.552 --> 34:47.818
           Sit down!

34:47.820 --> 34:49.686
        What the fuck?!

34:50.888 --> 34:53.356
       You have the right
       to remain silent.

34:53.358 --> 34:54.690
        Anything you say
        can and will be

34:54.693 --> 34:56.793
        used against you
       in a court of law.

34:59.264 --> 35:00.464
           Wait! No!

35:00.466 --> 35:01.731
          You can ask
        for an attorney.

35:01.733 --> 35:03.200
      If you cannot afford
          an attorney,

35:03.202 --> 35:04.801
      one will be provided
            for you.

35:04.803 --> 35:06.203
 Do you understand these rights
   as I've read them to you?

35:06.205 --> 35:07.404
           Yes. Yes.

35:07.406 --> 35:08.872
             Wait.
      What are you doing?

35:08.874 --> 35:10.273
    -No, this was a mistake.
  -Ma'am, please, take a seat.

35:10.275 --> 35:11.541
         I'm sorry, no.
     We were just talking.

35:11.543 --> 35:12.809
         This is a big
       misunderstanding.

35:12.811 --> 35:14.277
         Keep her down!
           Sit down!

35:14.279 --> 35:15.745
            Shut up
        and take a seat.

35:19.718 --> 35:21.585
             Ahhhh.

35:28.293 --> 35:29.559
        Can I help you?

35:29.561 --> 35:31.795
     Uh, yeah, do you know
       when Daniel Mercer

35:31.797 --> 35:32.996
     is gonna be released?

35:32.998 --> 35:35.866
         Can you spell
     his last name for me?

35:35.868 --> 35:37.801
          M-E-R-C-E-R.

35:48.913 --> 35:52.749
     Well, we can hold him
   for up to about 24 hours,

35:52.751 --> 35:55.619
  so I would suggest you maybe
      come back tomorrow.

36:02.426 --> 36:04.261
           24 hours?

36:04.263 --> 36:06.329
         24, at least.

36:08.432 --> 36:10.934
             Okay.

36:10.936 --> 36:13.436
        Okay, thank you.

36:48.940 --> 36:51.808
      Take me home, okay?

36:51.810 --> 36:54.411
             -Dan.
         -Don't do it.

37:03.654 --> 37:05.055
              Dan.

37:05.057 --> 37:06.890
             Dan --

37:29.080 --> 37:31.481
             Sorry.

37:31.483 --> 37:33.817
     I don't have anything
         to say to you.

38:26.404 --> 38:28.471
          Talk to me.

38:33.477 --> 38:34.978
I'm sorry.

38:39.450 --> 38:41.718
           I'm sorry.

39:48.719 --> 39:50.920
        Great job, Luke.
              Yes?

39:50.922 --> 39:53.923
   How do you spell "winter?"

39:53.925 --> 39:55.992
          Winter? W--

39:55.994 --> 39:59.262
       Mel, are you okay?

39:59.264 --> 40:01.231
           I'm sorry.
        I'm sorry, yeah.

40:01.233 --> 40:04.000
    I just don't feel good.
     I'm sorry about that.

40:04.002 --> 40:06.136
       Well, if you don't
  feel well, you can go home.

40:06.138 --> 40:08.905
            Really?

40:08.907 --> 40:11.141
       Yeah. I got this.
           Trust me.

40:11.143 --> 40:13.243
             Okay.

40:13.245 --> 40:15.111
      Yeah, maybe -- maybe
       it's for the best.

40:15.113 --> 40:17.514
           I'm sorry.

40:17.516 --> 40:19.249
    Don't worry. All right,
     I'll see you tomorrow.

40:19.251 --> 40:20.817
           Thank you.

40:20.819 --> 40:22.519
     All right, everybody.

40:22.521 --> 40:24.788
     Take two more minutes
      to finish your work.

40:24.790 --> 40:26.523
Yes, ma'am!

40:26.525 --> 40:27.857
          Yes, ma'am.

40:27.859 --> 40:29.559
          Yes, ma'am.

40:29.561 --> 40:30.927
          Yes, ma'am.

40:35.766 --> 40:38.201
              Dan!

40:38.203 --> 40:39.836
           Thank you.
         Saved us. Wow.

40:39.838 --> 40:42.172
   We got a question for ya.
       Please, sit down.

40:42.174 --> 40:44.974
             Okay.

40:47.278 --> 40:48.678
             So...

40:48.680 --> 40:51.648
          Question...

40:51.650 --> 40:54.918
    What do you like better,
        the Early Oughts

40:54.920 --> 40:56.986
       or the Wild Bucks?

40:56.988 --> 40:58.188
        The Wild Bucks.

40:58.190 --> 41:00.256
              Bam.
           Thank you.

41:00.258 --> 41:01.658
     Would you like a job?

41:01.660 --> 41:04.260
             What?

41:04.262 --> 41:06.663
           Seriously.
     Would you like a job?

41:06.665 --> 41:08.331
      You heard us talking
     about how we're gonna

41:08.333 --> 41:10.200
       set up that office
          in Brooklyn.

41:10.202 --> 41:11.868
        Jason's gonna go
     out there and run it.

41:11.870 --> 41:13.136
        I'm gonna be out
     every once in a while,

41:13.138 --> 41:15.638
      but we need somebody
      on the ground there

41:15.640 --> 41:19.209
         to do the shit
          he can't do.

41:19.211 --> 41:24.113
      Um, thank you, guys.
        This is amazing.

41:24.115 --> 41:25.882
   I don't know what to say.

41:25.884 --> 41:27.951
             Sure.
    It's like an assistant.

41:27.953 --> 41:29.853
     You help set up shop,
    get the office running,

41:29.855 --> 41:31.688
      you'll go see shows.

41:31.690 --> 41:35.825
  'Cause I have a newborn and
  I'll be moving into a house.

41:35.827 --> 41:39.696
       So I'll be living
    vicariously through you.

41:39.698 --> 41:41.831
             Cool.
     Well, think about it.

41:41.833 --> 41:44.801
I would feel much better if you
 were going out there with me.

41:44.803 --> 41:46.069
         But I'll talk
        to y'all later.

41:46.071 --> 41:47.837
             Okay.

41:50.808 --> 41:52.709
             Look,

41:52.711 --> 41:55.144
     I love the initiative
   you're taking here at Topo

41:55.146 --> 41:56.746
       and we wouldn't be
     offering you this job

41:56.748 --> 41:58.014
       if we didn't think

41:58.016 --> 42:00.383
      that you were really
      part of the family.

42:00.385 --> 42:01.851
         You know, like
     take a couple of days

42:01.853 --> 42:03.152
      and think about it,
          that's fine.

42:03.154 --> 42:04.387
          I understand
     you have a life here,

42:04.389 --> 42:06.322
    you've got a girlfriend.

42:06.324 --> 42:08.124
   You make choices in life.
           You know,

42:08.126 --> 42:09.993
       you win something,
      you lose something.

42:09.995 --> 42:12.028
     Man, I can't -- can't
       thank you enough.

42:12.030 --> 42:13.930
      Absolutely, brother.
         You earned it.

42:13.932 --> 42:16.065
             Cool.

42:16.067 --> 42:17.267
        Get the fuck out
          of my chair.

42:17.269 --> 42:18.668
             Okay.

42:18.670 --> 42:20.637
              Hey.

42:20.639 --> 42:21.938
           Congrats.

42:21.940 --> 42:23.206
          Thanks, man.

42:25.776 --> 42:28.044
    Yeah, no, they shouldn't
        know the words.

42:28.046 --> 42:31.147
      They can't possibly.

42:31.149 --> 42:32.782
           You knew?

42:32.784 --> 42:33.983
       You fucking knew.

42:33.985 --> 42:35.184
           Fuck you.

42:35.186 --> 42:36.719
          Why the fuck
      didn't you tell me?

42:36.721 --> 42:38.021
    They made me promise not
     to tell you. It was --

42:38.023 --> 42:39.322
    -"They made me promise."
       -It was very hard.

42:39.324 --> 42:41.024
     It was very difficult
    for me not to tell you.

42:41.026 --> 42:43.026
      Well, what the fuck?

42:43.028 --> 42:45.061
         Put 'er there.

42:45.063 --> 42:46.362
              Yes!

42:46.364 --> 42:48.798
      I'm sorry. I'm very
       happy and excited.

42:48.800 --> 42:50.366
       I'm happy for you.

42:50.368 --> 42:51.834
    You want to get a drink
      later to celebrate?

42:51.836 --> 42:53.036
            Mm-hmm.

42:53.038 --> 42:54.237
              Yes.

42:54.239 --> 42:55.438
        Mm-hmm, mm-hmm.

42:59.910 --> 43:01.177
        But, guys, like
      what if he's there?

43:01.179 --> 43:02.812
    He's not gonna be there.

43:02.814 --> 43:04.380
     I'd be surprised if he
    even knew these people.

43:04.382 --> 43:06.916
       Someone invited me
          from class.

43:06.918 --> 43:08.785
   Okay, you have some really
      cute things in here.

43:08.787 --> 43:10.386
       Guys, why isn't he
    texting me back already?

43:11.789 --> 43:13.156
            This is
       so fucking stupid.

43:13.158 --> 43:14.757
       Oh, my gosh, Mel.

43:14.759 --> 43:15.959
       Come on, come out
        with us tonight.

43:15.961 --> 43:19.062
          It'll be fun
    to just forget about Dan

43:19.064 --> 43:20.463
       and just let loose
         a little bit.

43:20.465 --> 43:22.231
              No.

43:22.233 --> 43:23.933
          It's stupid
       for me to go out.

43:23.935 --> 43:25.702
           All right.

43:25.704 --> 43:27.704
       Well, we are gonna
     get out of here, then.

43:27.706 --> 43:28.905
           All right.
           Have fun.

43:28.907 --> 43:30.106
           Bye, girl.

43:30.108 --> 43:31.341
            Call us
       if you wanna come.

43:31.343 --> 43:33.009
              Bye.

44:03.241 --> 44:05.341
         <i> Hey, it's Dan.</i>
      <i> You know what to do.</i>

44:05.343 --> 44:08.911
       Hey, uh, it's Mel.

44:08.913 --> 44:11.848
             Um...

44:11.850 --> 44:13.750
            I, uh --

44:13.752 --> 44:17.153
          I miss you.

44:17.155 --> 44:18.988
         Call me back.

44:18.990 --> 44:21.124
              Bye.

44:30.267 --> 44:32.268
              So.

44:32.270 --> 44:33.970
       Um, I just wanted
          to apologize

44:33.972 --> 44:35.505
        about that text
   I sent you the other day.

44:35.507 --> 44:36.906
       I was really drunk

44:36.908 --> 44:38.107
           and I know
     you have a girlfriend

44:38.109 --> 44:40.877
    and I do not want to be
          that person.

44:40.879 --> 44:44.480
         Even -- um...

44:44.482 --> 44:48.017
      Yeah, Mel and I are
    actually on kind of a...

44:48.019 --> 44:50.053
        break right now.

44:50.055 --> 44:53.523
         Well, tonight,
       we are celebrating

44:53.525 --> 44:55.425
         you leaving us
         for Brooklyn,

44:55.427 --> 44:56.926
         so let's drown
       your sorrows, huh?

44:56.928 --> 44:58.127
         Sounds great.

45:01.899 --> 45:03.099
             Ahem.

45:03.101 --> 45:04.467
              Ah.

45:04.469 --> 45:06.936
         I don't know,
       it's just kind of

45:06.938 --> 45:09.806
     frustrating right now,
           'cause...

45:09.808 --> 45:11.808
        I just felt like
         this should be

45:11.810 --> 45:13.342
   just a purely happy moment

45:13.344 --> 45:15.244
         and, instead,
         it's just like

45:15.246 --> 45:18.514
      "Now, what the fuck
           do I do?"

45:18.516 --> 45:20.149
             Uh...
      You go to Brooklyn.

45:20.151 --> 45:21.884
             Yeah,
      that's what you do.

45:21.886 --> 45:23.086
             Yeah.

45:23.088 --> 45:24.587
       Yeah, you're going
          to Brooklyn.

45:25.990 --> 45:27.290
     You'd be crazy not to.

45:27.292 --> 45:30.927
          I guess so.

45:30.929 --> 45:32.595
         I don't know.

45:32.597 --> 45:36.232
    I totally, totally know
   what you're going through.

45:36.234 --> 45:38.468
       My boyfriend and I
  broke up after we graduated,

45:38.470 --> 45:42.138
         but it took us
     about a year, I think,

45:42.140 --> 45:45.208
       to realize that's
    what we were doing and,

45:45.210 --> 45:47.443
     yeah, it just sucked.

45:49.114 --> 45:51.481
     Finally, after a long
       while, I realized

45:51.483 --> 45:55.351
    we were going in totally
     different directions.

45:55.353 --> 45:58.187
          But, I mean,
        maybe that's not

45:58.189 --> 46:00.556
      what's gonna happen
            to you.

46:12.536 --> 46:14.070
         Hey-ey-ey-ey.

46:14.072 --> 46:15.938
              Aah!
         What the fuck?

46:15.940 --> 46:17.140
           You came!

46:17.142 --> 46:18.574
    I'm so glad you're here.

46:18.576 --> 46:20.276
           Hey, hey,
     meet our new friends.

46:20.278 --> 46:21.477
         This is Will.

46:21.479 --> 46:23.045
              Hey.

46:23.047 --> 46:25.248
              Mel.
      And this is Austin.

46:25.250 --> 46:29.185
     You came just in time.
   We are just taking shots.

46:29.187 --> 46:33.356
      There you go, baby.

46:33.358 --> 46:35.525
       Wait, wait, wait,
      wait wait wait wait!

46:35.527 --> 46:37.093

     Wow. Very nice, guys.
           Very nice.

55:24.855 --> 55:29.425
      I'll be right back.

55:29.427 --> 55:32.027
    Mel, I can't understand
    anything you're saying.

55:43.106 --> 55:45.007
           I don't --

55:54.451 --> 55:56.652
      What the fuck, Mel?

55:56.654 --> 55:59.054
      You call me, you say
      you're at my house,

55:59.056 --> 56:00.456
       and you're crying
         and I have to

56:00.458 --> 56:01.724
         fuckin' leave
       and come get you,

56:01.726 --> 56:04.960
    and, now, you don't want
         to talk to me?

56:04.962 --> 56:08.030
Can you...?

56:08.032 --> 56:09.231
           All right.

56:09.233 --> 56:11.033
      He was on top of me.

56:11.035 --> 56:12.601
       I pushed him off,
       I pushed him off,

56:12.603 --> 56:14.503
    'cause I didn't want to
           and he --

56:14.505 --> 56:17.706
           Oh, shit.

56:17.708 --> 56:19.074

56:19.076 --> 56:20.509
          What are you
         talking about?

56:20.511 --> 56:21.710
       Dan, I didn't even
        want to go out.

56:21.712 --> 56:23.112
    I didn't want to go out,
          but Becca --

56:23.114 --> 56:24.580
          What are you
         talking about?

56:24.582 --> 56:27.049
    He was just everywhere.

56:27.051 --> 56:28.250
       I pushed him off.

56:28.252 --> 56:29.651
              Oh!

56:29.653 --> 56:30.853
         Are you okay?

56:30.855 --> 56:32.755
   Yeah, I just -- I'm fine.

56:32.757 --> 56:34.590
         What the fuck?
        Who is this guy?

56:34.592 --> 56:36.158
    I'm fine. I don't know.
      He's gone, he left.

56:36.160 --> 56:37.559
     What did he do to you?

56:37.561 --> 56:39.128
          Oh, my God.
        I can't take it.

56:39.130 --> 56:40.596
     What did he do to you?

56:40.598 --> 56:41.897
     Nothing. He didn't --
          I pushed --

56:41.899 --> 56:43.532
     Can you just hold me,
            please?

56:43.534 --> 56:45.100
     You don't understand.
  I just need you to hold me.

56:45.102 --> 56:46.902
           I -- ahhh.

56:52.542 --> 56:54.243

57:05.856 --> 57:07.790
        I shouldn't have
        come over here.

57:07.792 --> 57:09.057
      You don't even want
           to see me.

57:09.059 --> 57:10.559
     I shouldn't have come
           over here.

57:10.561 --> 57:12.795
      No, that's not true.
        That's not true.

57:12.797 --> 57:14.229
             Sorry.

57:14.231 --> 57:16.298
        Don't be sorry.
     Don't apologize to me.

57:16.300 --> 57:19.802
-Please, don't apologize to me.
     -I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

57:19.804 --> 57:23.639
     I was just so scared.

58:32.642 --> 58:34.276
      You want some help?

58:34.278 --> 58:35.677
              No.

58:35.679 --> 58:37.613
            Oh, God.

58:37.615 --> 58:40.916
   I can't believe your mom's
   moving out of this house.

58:40.918 --> 58:42.184
       Where's the tape?

58:42.186 --> 58:44.019
         I don't know.
      Will you come here?

58:44.021 --> 58:45.354
            C'mere.

58:45.356 --> 58:47.256
           You okay?

58:47.258 --> 58:48.690
         I don't know.

58:48.692 --> 58:50.025
            I think
      you're done packing.

58:50.027 --> 58:53.362
          It's the end
        of my childhood.

58:53.364 --> 58:55.397
     I have to grow up now?

58:55.399 --> 58:56.865
       Yeah, I guess so.

58:56.867 --> 58:58.367
         I guess that's
       what's happening.

59:00.803 --> 59:02.337
     But it's not that bad,
             right?

59:02.339 --> 59:05.974
          It's kind of
         a cool thing.

59:05.976 --> 59:07.643
   Everything fits in boxes.

59:07.645 --> 59:09.778
      How can you pack up
      your life in boxes?

59:09.780 --> 59:11.313
    I don't know, but you've
       done a great job.

59:11.315 --> 59:13.315
            -Thanks.
     -You really did great.

59:13.317 --> 59:15.817
             -Hey.
             -Hey.

59:15.819 --> 59:17.719
           What's up?

59:17.721 --> 59:19.154
        Do you remember
        our first time?

59:19.156 --> 59:20.722
            Mm-hmm.

59:20.724 --> 59:22.658
      And do you remember
     that my mom came home?

59:24.929 --> 59:26.728
    I'm pretty sure she was
    there during some of it.

59:26.730 --> 59:27.930
              No!

59:27.932 --> 59:29.164
          -I think so.
              -No!

59:29.166 --> 59:30.866
          'Cause when
      we came downstairs,

59:30.868 --> 59:32.701
       her face was like

59:32.703 --> 59:35.704
            "How...
       How is everything?

59:35.706 --> 59:36.905
      Is everything okay?"

59:36.907 --> 59:38.106
        Dan, I couldn't
          look at her.

59:38.108 --> 59:39.308
        Oh, I remember.

59:39.310 --> 59:41.076
     Oh! I get embarrassed,

59:41.078 --> 59:42.678
   just thinking about that.

59:42.680 --> 59:44.179
      Oh! You just totally
         ran out on me.

59:44.181 --> 59:45.781
           I'm sorry.

59:45.783 --> 59:48.216
   I was like "what the fuck?
       Where did she go?"

59:49.352 --> 59:53.188
    Then, we got ice cream.

59:53.190 --> 59:54.690
         You bought me
         an ice cream.

59:54.692 --> 59:56.258
        Yeah. Gentleman.

59:56.260 --> 59:58.393
            Classy.

01:00:12.875 --> 01:00:14.242
              Hey.

01:00:14.244 --> 01:00:15.711
              Hi.

01:00:15.713 --> 01:00:17.713
        How's it going?

01:00:17.715 --> 01:00:19.281
             Good.
       How's the packing?

01:00:19.283 --> 01:00:20.983
            Oh, it's
       a little intense.

01:00:20.985 --> 01:00:22.250
        Mel and her mom,
         they're upset.

01:00:22.252 --> 01:00:24.853
           -It's hot.
             -Yeah.

01:00:24.855 --> 01:00:26.221
      Well, you can always
      take a swim, after.

01:00:26.223 --> 01:00:27.789
            Mm-hmm.

01:00:27.791 --> 01:00:29.992
     I just want to get it
       through, you know?

01:00:29.994 --> 01:00:31.259
       Get it done with.

01:00:31.261 --> 01:00:32.928
      What are you doing?

01:00:32.930 --> 01:00:36.231
      Oh, emails, nothing.

01:00:36.233 --> 01:00:37.799
            Mm-hmm?

01:00:37.801 --> 01:00:41.737
       I have some news.

01:00:41.739 --> 01:00:44.406
    Um, so, the record label
        offered me a job

01:00:44.408 --> 01:00:45.874
          in New York.

01:00:45.876 --> 01:00:47.075
              Wow.

01:00:47.077 --> 01:00:48.410
        Yeah. It's cool.

01:00:48.412 --> 01:00:50.178
             Yeah.

01:00:50.180 --> 01:00:52.514
    But I don't know whether
   or not to do it, you know?

01:00:52.516 --> 01:00:55.784
    Like we -- Mel and I --
         we had a plan.

01:00:55.786 --> 01:00:57.119
       I just don't know
          what to do.

01:00:57.121 --> 01:01:01.089
    Okay, do you -- you want
        my real answer?

01:01:01.091 --> 01:01:02.290
             Yeah.

01:01:02.292 --> 01:01:04.092
     'Cause my real answer
            is that

01:01:04.094 --> 01:01:08.864
     you need to make this
      decision about you,

01:01:08.866 --> 01:01:11.266
        not Mel and not
       this relationship.

01:01:11.268 --> 01:01:13.201
         Honey, I know

01:01:13.203 --> 01:01:16.271
       how special it is
       with you and Mel.

01:01:16.273 --> 01:01:18.006
         You're family
         to each other

01:01:18.008 --> 01:01:20.108
        and we all are,
       we're all family.

01:01:20.110 --> 01:01:21.877
        And I love her.

01:01:21.879 --> 01:01:23.111
        This is nothing
          against Mel.

01:01:23.113 --> 01:01:27.516
      But I am telling you
            this is

01:01:27.518 --> 01:01:31.286
      a great opportunity
    and I know you want it.

01:01:31.288 --> 01:01:32.988
         I know you do.

01:01:32.990 --> 01:01:35.290
         And, honestly,
      if I could tell you

01:01:35.292 --> 01:01:36.792
            anything
      that was valuable --

01:01:36.794 --> 01:01:38.794
     And I'm talking to you
      as an adult, now --

01:01:38.796 --> 01:01:42.330
           That if --
      if I could go back,

01:01:42.332 --> 01:01:43.965
      have it over again,
        there are things

01:01:43.967 --> 01:01:45.467
     I would change, there
      are things that I --

01:01:45.469 --> 01:01:47.002
           Like what?

01:01:47.004 --> 01:01:49.538
       Well, I don't know
 and I'm -- this isn't about me

01:01:49.540 --> 01:01:52.307
    or regrets, or anything,
      it's just I'm trying

01:01:52.309 --> 01:01:54.910
       to share with you
    that we make decisions,

01:01:54.912 --> 01:01:57.012
      they affect the rest
         of our lives.

01:01:57.014 --> 01:01:58.847
    I would have maybe gone
         to grad school

01:01:58.849 --> 01:02:01.450
    and had a career I love
         and, you know.

01:02:01.452 --> 01:02:04.453
        Please, you know
        what I'm saying.

01:02:04.455 --> 01:02:06.154
          I know what
         you're saying.

01:02:06.156 --> 01:02:07.856
          It's kind of
           stressful.

01:02:07.858 --> 01:02:10.025
     Well, I don't want you
        to have regrets.

01:02:10.027 --> 01:02:11.960
           Me either.

01:02:11.962 --> 01:02:13.962
       Yeah, that's what
       I'm talking about.

01:02:13.964 --> 01:02:16.098
     This life goes around
           one time.

01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:17.365
--That's it.

01:02:17.367 --> 01:02:19.835
         -No pressure.
       -Well, it's true.

01:02:19.837 --> 01:02:21.103
     I know, you're right.

01:02:21.105 --> 01:02:23.438
             Fuck.

01:02:23.440 --> 01:02:26.208
           You know,
     we want this for you,

01:02:26.210 --> 01:02:27.909
     if it's what you want.

01:03:06.883 --> 01:03:09.551
           So, um...

01:03:09.553 --> 01:03:11.620
           I have to
      tell you something.

01:03:16.392 --> 01:03:18.393
        The record label
       offered me a job.

01:03:18.395 --> 01:03:20.462
             What?!

01:03:20.464 --> 01:03:22.464
             What?!

01:03:22.466 --> 01:03:24.332
          Oh, my God.

01:03:24.334 --> 01:03:25.534
        That's amazing.

01:03:25.536 --> 01:03:27.068
         Yeah, I know.

01:03:27.070 --> 01:03:28.270
       I'm superexcited.

01:03:28.272 --> 01:03:29.671
       But it's gonna be
          in New York

01:03:29.673 --> 01:03:33.108
    and I'm gonna like help
     open the office there

01:03:33.110 --> 01:03:34.509
     as Jason's assistant,
           basically.

01:03:34.511 --> 01:03:36.444
             What?

01:03:36.446 --> 01:03:37.679
          In New York?

01:03:37.681 --> 01:03:39.381
             Yeah.

01:03:39.383 --> 01:03:41.249
     I mean, it's gonna be
       like totally fine.

01:03:41.251 --> 01:03:43.084
     It's just for a year,
           you know?

01:03:43.086 --> 01:03:44.619
     We'll do long-distance
        and we'll visit

01:03:44.621 --> 01:03:46.087
          each other,
     like my freshman year.

01:03:46.089 --> 01:03:47.455
          But that was
     completely different.

01:03:47.457 --> 01:03:48.924
  It worked out fine, though,
        and you can come

01:03:48.926 --> 01:03:50.192
          to New York
       when you graduate.

01:03:50.194 --> 01:03:52.160
          No, you were
        two hours away,

01:03:52.162 --> 01:03:53.562
      not half the country
             away.

01:03:53.564 --> 01:03:56.064
    That's okay. We've been
     together for so long,

01:03:56.066 --> 01:03:57.365
       we could do that.
         It's nothing.

01:03:57.367 --> 01:03:59.100
       Just listen, okay?
    I've thought about this.

01:03:59.102 --> 01:04:00.335
      Well, what about us?

01:04:00.337 --> 01:04:01.603
     I've thought about it
             and --

01:04:01.605 --> 01:04:03.104
             Yeah?

01:04:03.106 --> 01:04:05.173
       We can totally do
    this long-distance thing

01:04:05.175 --> 01:04:06.441
          for a year.

01:04:06.443 --> 01:04:08.143
        W-Well, well --

01:04:08.145 --> 01:04:11.479
      Why are you reacting
           this way?

01:04:11.481 --> 01:04:12.714
     Did you take the job?

01:04:12.716 --> 01:04:14.182
         No, I haven't
         taken it, yet,

01:04:14.184 --> 01:04:16.218
       but I'm going to,
           obviously.

01:04:16.220 --> 01:04:17.686
             I ca--

01:04:17.688 --> 01:04:19.487
        I can't believe
       you're doing this.

01:04:19.489 --> 01:04:21.056
        What am I doing?

01:04:21.058 --> 01:04:22.490
       What do you mean?
        You're leaving!

01:04:22.492 --> 01:04:24.259
   You're going to New York.
     You can't just <i> decide</i>

01:04:24.261 --> 01:04:25.627
         to do things.

01:04:25.629 --> 01:04:27.262
     Why can't you just be
      happy for me, okay?

01:04:27.264 --> 01:04:29.731
       This is a job that
    I've wanted for <i> so</i> long.

01:04:29.733 --> 01:04:31.633
    -No, the job you wanted
      was here in Austin.
     -I just want you to be
         happy for me.

01:04:31.635 --> 01:04:33.335
          This is what
        we planned for.

01:04:33.337 --> 01:04:34.603
     It's not as if things

01:04:34.605 --> 01:04:36.304
         always happen
       according to plan.

01:04:36.306 --> 01:04:37.706
    Well, it's not like <i> you</i>
   can just make the changes.

01:04:37.708 --> 01:04:39.174
   Can't you be a little bit
       flexible, please?

01:04:39.176 --> 01:04:40.442
        Well, can't you
        decide something

01:04:40.444 --> 01:04:41.710
        that's not just
         for yourself?

01:04:41.712 --> 01:04:43.178
      Why can't you think
           about me?

01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:44.579
     All you think about is
            yourself

01:04:44.581 --> 01:04:46.114
       and all the things
           you want.

01:04:46.116 --> 01:04:48.183
    You're saying I'm being
        selfish and like

01:04:48.185 --> 01:04:49.451
     I try and talk to you
           about this

01:04:49.453 --> 01:04:50.719
     and you just flip out!

01:04:50.721 --> 01:04:52.621
         You've already
        made a decision.

01:04:52.623 --> 01:04:55.290
You flip out at any conversation
  of me not being with you --

01:04:55.292 --> 01:04:56.558
    It's not a conversation!

01:04:56.560 --> 01:04:58.026
         You flip out.
   I can't believe you're --

01:04:58.028 --> 01:04:59.327
   You didn't want to see me
         for two weeks.

01:04:59.329 --> 01:05:01.029
   You just kicked me aside.
        You ignored me!

01:05:01.031 --> 01:05:03.398
   I did not kick you aside.
       I asked for space!

01:05:03.400 --> 01:05:05.066
    And you couldn't respect
    that, in the slightest.

01:05:05.068 --> 01:05:06.501
        You flipped out.

01:05:06.503 --> 01:05:08.570
   It's like you need me and,
      if I'm not with you

01:05:08.572 --> 01:05:11.273
         all the time,
    you're gonna fall apart.

01:05:11.275 --> 01:05:12.707
       It is exhausting,

01:05:12.709 --> 01:05:14.242
       being with someone
    who is so <i> fucking</i> needy.

01:05:14.244 --> 01:05:15.510
       I don't need you!

01:05:15.512 --> 01:05:18.446
   I don't fucking need you,
          so get out.

01:05:18.448 --> 01:05:20.415
Okay.

01:05:20.417 --> 01:05:22.083
      Dan, I'm s-- I'm --

01:05:22.085 --> 01:05:23.618
please, Dan,
        leave right now.

01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:25.487
You don't
       want me to leave.

01:05:25.489 --> 01:05:27.722
   I want you to get the fuck
   out of my house right now!

01:05:27.724 --> 01:05:30.358
            I can't.

01:05:30.360 --> 01:05:31.726
        Dan, go, please!

01:05:31.728 --> 01:05:34.329
        All right, fine.

01:05:34.331 --> 01:05:35.764
        Fuckin' asshole.

01:05:35.766 --> 01:05:37.532
           Fuck you!

01:05:37.534 --> 01:05:40.168
      Fucking little kid.
             Jesus.

01:06:15.404 --> 01:06:18.306
             Shit!

01:06:18.308 --> 01:06:20.508
             Shit!

01:06:29.518 --> 01:06:31.686
   Why do I keep doing this?

01:06:31.688 --> 01:06:33.088
           Hey, Mel?

01:06:33.090 --> 01:06:34.322
           Oh, fuck!

01:06:34.324 --> 01:06:36.591
      He's not picking up.
      He's not picking up.

01:06:36.593 --> 01:06:39.194
            -C'mere.
             -God!

01:06:39.196 --> 01:06:40.462
   I have to -- I have to --
   I have to go talk to him.

01:06:40.464 --> 01:06:41.830
      No. Mel, that is not
          a good idea.

01:06:41.832 --> 01:06:43.465
     I need to talk to him
      and explain things.

01:06:43.467 --> 01:06:45.467
      God, he can be such
    a fucking asshole, too.

01:06:45.469 --> 01:06:46.768
     Well, just sleep on it

01:06:46.770 --> 01:06:48.770
       and go talk to him
           tomorrow.

01:06:48.772 --> 01:06:50.238
        Give him a day.

01:06:50.240 --> 01:06:52.340
           Oh, shit.

01:06:52.342 --> 01:06:54.676
       I fucked this up.

01:06:57.714 --> 01:06:59.180
             Shit.

01:07:18.769 --> 01:07:20.368
          Hey, Amanda.

01:07:25.408 --> 01:07:26.674
             Here?

01:07:26.676 --> 01:07:28.710
            Mm-hmm.

01:07:34.785 --> 01:07:37.318
          -Cool flag.
            -Thanks.

01:07:51.667 --> 01:07:53.501
      You play that thing?

01:07:53.503 --> 01:07:55.303
           Sometimes.

01:07:55.305 --> 01:07:57.338
         You any good?

01:07:58.542 --> 01:08:01.709
         I don't know.
            Kind of.

01:08:11.520 --> 01:08:13.588
     Can I play something?

01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:16.691
             Yeah.

01:08:16.693 --> 01:08:18.725
     Oh, my God, I fucking
       love this record.

01:08:18.728 --> 01:08:21.529
        So fucking good.

01:10:10.407 --> 01:10:11.873
              Unh!

01:10:25.487 --> 01:10:27.322
              Hey.

01:10:28.692 --> 01:10:29.958
              Hi.

01:10:35.831 --> 01:10:37.732
         I have to go.

01:11:13.936 --> 01:11:15.536
        -See you later?
            -Mm-hmm.

01:11:34.624 --> 01:11:38.026
         I'm gonna go.

01:11:38.028 --> 01:11:39.427
            Come on.

01:12:03.687 --> 01:12:05.453
You fucking asshole!

01:12:05.455 --> 01:12:06.954
          -Stop! Stop!
         -What the fuck
      is wrong with you?!

01:12:06.956 --> 01:12:08.990
     How could you fucking
         do this to me?

01:12:08.992 --> 01:12:10.625
          I hate you!

01:12:10.627 --> 01:12:11.826
              Aah!

01:12:11.828 --> 01:12:15.663
          You fucking
         piece of shit!

01:12:15.665 --> 01:12:17.432
          I came here
         to apologize.

01:12:17.434 --> 01:12:19.534
    How fucking stupid am I?

01:12:19.536 --> 01:12:20.802
  To come here and apologize,
        see if we could

01:12:20.804 --> 01:12:22.904
          work it out
      in fucking New York.

01:12:22.906 --> 01:12:26.207
             Shit!

01:12:26.209 --> 01:12:27.675
          You fucking
         piece of shit!

01:12:27.677 --> 01:12:29.010
            Stop it!

01:12:29.012 --> 01:12:31.112
     Aah! You gonna hit me?

01:12:31.114 --> 01:12:33.047
              Aah!

01:12:33.049 --> 01:12:34.615
             You --

01:12:34.617 --> 01:12:35.817
              Ah!

01:12:39.988 --> 01:12:43.024
             Fuck!

01:13:48.857 --> 01:13:50.825
              Hi.

01:13:57.199 --> 01:13:59.700
        How you feeling?

01:13:59.702 --> 01:14:03.638
      I'm okay. I'm fine.

01:14:03.640 --> 01:14:06.607
       I've been better.

01:14:11.213 --> 01:14:12.780
             Yeah.

01:14:17.953 --> 01:14:20.855
      I'm so embarrassed.

01:14:25.028 --> 01:14:27.728
            Me too.

01:14:27.730 --> 01:14:29.964
      Will you come closer
         to me, please?

01:14:56.758 --> 01:14:58.993
       I'm really sorry.

01:15:02.965 --> 01:15:07.935
      I love you so much.

01:15:07.937 --> 01:15:13.274
     And I've been thinking
       about this and...

01:15:13.276 --> 01:15:15.243
       I don't want to go
      to New York anymore.

01:15:15.245 --> 01:15:17.712
          I don't want
      to change our plans.

01:15:17.714 --> 01:15:19.614
   I want to make this work.

01:15:19.616 --> 01:15:21.382
       So I'm not going.

01:15:25.954 --> 01:15:28.856
            I think
      you should take it.

01:15:28.858 --> 01:15:32.927
        No. What are you
         talking about?

01:15:37.633 --> 01:15:39.133
    Dan, I love you so much.

01:15:39.135 --> 01:15:40.401
        I love you, too.

01:15:40.403 --> 01:15:41.869
   But it doesn't feel right.

01:15:41.871 --> 01:15:43.237
      I can't not see you
           every day.

01:15:43.239 --> 01:15:44.939
    I can't not be with you.

01:15:44.941 --> 01:15:49.310
     Please don't do this.

01:15:49.312 --> 01:15:53.314
   I don't want to break up.

01:15:53.316 --> 01:15:57.218
      Tell me you love me
          and you want

01:15:57.220 --> 01:16:01.989
       to spend the rest
     of your life with me.

01:16:01.991 --> 01:16:05.860
       Look me in the eye
          and tell me.

01:16:22.711 --> 01:16:25.880
           I'm sorry.

01:16:28.818 --> 01:16:30.251
             Fuck!
