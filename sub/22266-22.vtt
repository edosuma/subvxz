You know, I heard about these guys
when I was working undercover,

00:06.507 --> 00:08.544
I never could get anyone to confirm
their existence.

Help me stop him.

Uh, yes, there is.

- What?

00:49.174 --> 00:51.541
Can you pass the salt, please,
quickly, when you get the chance.

00:55.722 --> 00:57.179
I cannot put salt on this

00:57.266 --> 00:59.508
if it's gonna put that expression
on your face.

00:59.685 --> 01:02.553

- Okay.

01:02.771 --> 01:04.307

01:17.703 --> 01:19.410
put in prison for the rest of your life.

01:19.621 --> 01:22.079

and the man who tried put you there

Second,

01:33.427 --> 01:36.420
I am in here scrambling eggs

01:36.513 --> 01:39.881

01:40.726 --> 01:42.763
to remind myself what I'm fighting for.

01:43.186 --> 01:45.769

I guess I can departmentalize that.

are gone.

01:59.411 --> 02:01.073
Do you mind telling me how you did this?

02:01.413 --> 02:02.824
Sorry, Doc, NDA.

02:03.582 --> 02:06.074
So, if he's in the clear,
does that mean no more check ups?

Well, you guys are good to go.

about fooling around in an office?

I also think that he might be
the one move

12:09.437 --> 12:11.099
Diaz does not see coming.

12:11.189 --> 12:13.681
But, Oliver, if that's our tactical
advantage, we need to press it.

12:13.983 --> 12:16.896
Let me set a meet with him. Okay?

12:16.986 --> 12:19.194
Let us make a move off of his intel,

12:19.280 --> 12:20.612
but until we have it,

12:21.658 --> 12:24.321
I want you guys to stand down
and I...

12:25.703 --> 12:27.035
I'm asking you to trust me.

12:28.790 --> 12:31.453
I know that that trust
does not come easy

12:31.542 --> 12:33.124
after everything's that's happened.

12:34.796 --> 12:37.083
Let's put all of that aside

12:38.549 --> 12:40.336
and get this done.

12:46.516 --> 12:47.506
(SPEAKING RUSSIAN)

12:47.600 --> 12:49.683
Thank you very much.

12:50.061 --> 12:51.552
(IN ENGLISH)
My family is alive thanks to you.

12:51.646 --> 12:54.354
Please save gratitude for
when I'm sipping on

12:54.440 --> 12:56.022
umbrella straw on beach,

12:56.109 --> 12:57.691
safe and sound in Maldives.

13:01.739 --> 13:04.607
I don't know how long your family's
safety is going to last.

13:05.201 --> 13:08.785
SCPD has instructions, kill on sight.

13:08.913 --> 13:11.121
Diaz's base of operations is too secure.

13:11.207 --> 13:14.450
We can't move on it
without losing people.

13:14.836 --> 13:16.043
Agreed.

13:16.963 --> 13:18.420
Best bet to get him on move.

13:19.590 --> 13:20.797
In transit, so to speak.

13:20.925 --> 13:23.087
Well, but he's gonna expect us
to hit back.

13:23.177 --> 13:25.464
I'd expect him to stay
where he's secure.

13:25.555 --> 13:28.423
Perhaps I can think of something
to motivate him.

13:29.600 --> 13:31.182
I'm asking a lot of you.

13:33.521 --> 13:34.682
I appreciate it.

13:34.981 --> 13:36.563
You cannot wage revolution

13:37.442 --> 13:38.603
in white gloves.

13:42.405 --> 13:44.021
Lenin had many faults,

13:44.741 --> 13:46.528
but he was right about that.

13:51.622 --> 13:54.205
You wanna stop pacing?
Giving me a headache.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.537
Funny, I was going to say
the same to you.

13:57.295 --> 14:00.584
Your pitch to the Quadrant
was that you controlled this city.

14:00.673 --> 14:01.789
And I do.

14:01.966 --> 14:04.458
Then why have you turned it
into a war zone tonight?

14:04.594 --> 14:07.462
I thought we couldn't let the vigilantes
be turned into martyrs.

14:08.056 --> 14:11.299
The judge kicked the case
and let Oliver Queen walk.

14:11.392 --> 14:14.476
So you switched gears
from careful and precise

14:14.604 --> 14:16.061
to loud and messy?

14:16.564 --> 14:21.150
Your attitude is what I find...

14:24.197 --> 14:25.688
...to be unwanted.

14:26.657 --> 14:28.023
Be careful, Ricardo.

14:28.117 --> 14:29.608
You've already given us the city.

14:31.037 --> 14:34.451
Are you suggesting that

14:36.876 --> 14:38.162
I'm replaceable?

14:39.128 --> 14:40.915
I'm suggesting no such thing.

14:47.387 --> 14:50.004
Miss Cassamento does not appear
to be pleased.

14:50.264 --> 14:52.927
- What happened tonight?
- You underestimate your enemy.

14:53.142 --> 14:54.633
They're strong and motivated.

14:55.103 --> 14:56.219
They got lucky.

14:56.437 --> 14:58.850
Luck, strength, what does it matter?

15:00.024 --> 15:03.017
You did not kill bees.
You merely poked the hive.

15:03.736 --> 15:05.227
Bees will be agitated.

15:05.446 --> 15:08.359
You think they're gonna come here?
That's fine.

15:08.449 --> 15:09.565
Let them bring it on.

15:09.659 --> 15:10.900
Bring them here?

15:13.830 --> 15:16.447
This place, lovely,

15:17.208 --> 15:18.449
but not secure.

15:19.293 --> 15:20.534
At least not enough

15:20.628 --> 15:22.790
for what you know
they're going to come after you with.

15:30.054 --> 15:31.295
Anatoly did it.

15:31.722 --> 15:34.305
Diaz will be on his way
to the SCPD in an hour.

15:34.392 --> 15:36.634
A.R.G.U.S. doesn't have the authority
to arrest Diaz,

15:36.811 --> 15:39.724
so once you have him in custody,
what's the next step?

15:39.939 --> 15:41.851
Yeah, Lyla's right. We can't just
hand him over to the police.

15:42.150 --> 15:45.894
And, no offense, but your Lian Yu
super max is kind of blown up.

15:46.154 --> 15:48.191
One problem at a time.

15:48.739 --> 15:49.775
All right, we need to end this

15:49.866 --> 15:51.732
and that means
solving our first problem.

15:51.868 --> 15:53.200
Getting Diaz.

15:54.871 --> 15:57.284
Can I say it for old times sake?

15:59.125 --> 16:00.115
Suit up.

16:11.304 --> 16:13.671
In Russia, we travel in nicer cars.

16:15.349 --> 16:18.433
This girl ain't pretty,
but she's bullet proof.

16:24.275 --> 16:25.356
What's that?

16:28.571 --> 16:29.903
Construction?

16:32.658 --> 16:34.866
Hold up, guys.
We gotta move this forklift.

16:43.252 --> 16:44.959
Get this under control now.

16:46.130 --> 16:48.213
(GUNFIRE)

16:48.633 --> 16:49.874
You forget your gun?

17:04.523 --> 17:05.810
(BOTH GRUNT)

17:08.778 --> 17:09.894
Curtis, don't!

17:13.532 --> 17:14.522
(GRUNTING)

17:17.161 --> 17:18.823
You hurt someone I care about!

17:19.413 --> 17:20.654
You want some more?

17:21.415 --> 17:22.531
You...

17:22.625 --> 17:23.991
(GRUNTS)

17:35.304 --> 17:37.136

(GUN COCKING)

17:42.186 --> 17:43.427
(GRUNTS)

17:50.611 --> 17:52.944
Quadrant reinforcements with SCPD
and more are on the way.

17:53.030 --> 17:54.111
We gotta pull out now.

17:54.198 --> 17:55.359
(SIREN WAILING)

18:14.427 --> 18:15.918
JOHN: We almost got that son of a bitch.

18:16.512 --> 18:17.628
RENE: How's Curtis?

18:18.431 --> 18:19.797
DINAH: He's resting with Nick.

18:20.558 --> 18:23.301
One inch either way,
he would have bled out. He got lucky.

18:23.394 --> 18:25.431
- It wasn't just luck.
- What do you mean?

18:25.521 --> 18:27.262
Diaz could have killed Curtis,

18:27.523 --> 18:30.436
but he went for some sort of
necklace instead.

18:30.526 --> 18:32.688
Must be one damn important
piece of jewelry.

18:32.778 --> 18:34.064
More like a piece of tech. Look.

18:34.822 --> 18:38.782
It's a GRV-657. Solid state drive,
military grade, dynamic encryption.

18:39.035 --> 18:41.027
Whatever is on it,
Diaz has gone through some major trouble

18:41.120 --> 18:42.577
to keep it secure and close though.

18:42.663 --> 18:44.404
This looks like something we should
have our hands on.

18:44.498 --> 18:46.911
Wait, how do we know?
There could be nothing on it.

18:47.001 --> 18:48.867
You just said so yourself.
I mean, Diaz went after this

18:48.961 --> 18:50.042
instead of going after Curtis.

18:51.005 --> 18:52.792
Your digital sniffer,
can it read the drive?

18:52.882 --> 18:54.498
Yeah. If you get me close enough,
for sure.

18:54.592 --> 18:56.003
But Diaz is headed to SCPD.

18:56.093 --> 18:57.504
I'm sure he's gonna let us
stroll right in.

18:57.595 --> 18:58.756
They'll let me.

18:59.972 --> 19:02.760
What do you mean? Diaz knows that
A.R.G.U.S. is working against him.

19:03.017 --> 19:05.225
The police still have to
keep up appearances.

19:05.353 --> 19:06.639
Wouldn't look good if the decline

19:06.729 --> 19:08.891
a visit from the head of
a federal agency.

19:09.649 --> 19:12.608
And if things go south,
I've got you to back me up.

19:13.235 --> 19:17.149
I think that this is a big gamble
for an unknown pay off.

19:17.239 --> 19:18.696
It probably is, Oliver,

19:20.326 --> 19:21.533
but it might be our only shot.

19:22.536 --> 19:23.868
So, we're all on board here?

19:25.581 --> 19:26.742
Yeah.

19:26.832 --> 19:29.290
Double perimeter security.

19:29.377 --> 19:31.289
Next time I see Oliver Queen,

19:31.671 --> 19:33.378
I want his head on a spike.

19:33.506 --> 19:34.792
You got it, boss.

19:35.508 --> 19:36.874
Where's the tech kid?

19:36.967 --> 19:38.208
Cosby's over there.

19:42.598 --> 19:44.305
Oh, Mr. Diaz.

19:44.975 --> 19:48.013
I need to know if what's on this
is still intact

19:48.437 --> 19:50.099
without you looking at the data.

19:50.981 --> 19:53.598
- Can you do that?
- Uh...

19:54.443 --> 19:56.105
Your grandma's life depends on it.

19:57.530 --> 19:58.771
Yes, sir.

19:58.864 --> 20:00.275
(EXHALES)

20:09.625 --> 20:11.036
DIAZ: Close the door.

20:16.632 --> 20:17.793
(CHOKING)

20:17.925 --> 20:19.041
They knew!

20:19.427 --> 20:21.089
Who? Knew what?

20:21.178 --> 20:22.669
That I was moving!

20:23.597 --> 20:27.466
That my men were coming
for them tonight!

20:29.145 --> 20:32.980
Laurel, she's buttoned up, right?

20:35.901 --> 20:37.142
Who could've told them?

20:37.236 --> 20:38.818
I do not know.

20:38.904 --> 20:40.190
Hmm?

20:40.489 --> 20:41.775
You and Queen,

20:43.033 --> 20:44.240
you go way back.

20:44.493 --> 20:45.574
Yes.

20:46.036 --> 20:48.995
Which is why his betrayal hurts so much.

20:52.710 --> 20:54.372
If it wasn't you,

21:00.718 --> 21:02.175
then who?

21:02.553 --> 21:03.634
Hmm?

21:03.721 --> 21:07.510
Who brought men and police
to help us tonight?

21:11.854 --> 21:14.688
- Cassamento.
- How did she know we'd be attacked?

21:16.233 --> 21:17.724
I did not ask for backup.

21:18.402 --> 21:19.392
Did you?

21:21.197 --> 21:23.154
Why would she tip off Queen

21:24.742 --> 21:26.859
and then drag our asses

21:28.871 --> 21:30.237
out of the fire?

21:32.249 --> 21:33.285
That doesn't make sense.

21:33.375 --> 21:36.584
Yes, it does if she wants leverage
over you.

21:36.962 --> 21:38.544
To make you grovel.

21:40.508 --> 21:43.672
Truth be telling,
I do many times before in Bratva.

21:44.887 --> 21:46.344
I don't grovel.

21:49.934 --> 21:51.266
How's it going with the sniffer?

21:51.352 --> 21:53.719
Oh, just snifferific.

21:53.813 --> 21:55.554
I am programming it to specifically

21:55.648 --> 21:57.685
couple with the digital signature
of Diaz's drive.

21:58.067 --> 21:59.524
I'll have to do some
on the fly programming

21:59.610 --> 22:02.068
just to cut out the noise,
but totally in my wheelhouse.

22:03.823 --> 22:05.564
Does this absolutely
have to be done on site?

22:05.658 --> 22:09.117
It absolutely does if you would
absolutely like it to work. Why?

22:13.040 --> 22:15.657
Oliver, you do know I have been
on the field before, right?

22:16.126 --> 22:17.742
Russia. Twice.

22:18.420 --> 22:20.412
Nanda Parbat, Merlyn Global.

22:20.506 --> 22:22.418
That all happened
before you were a parent.

22:23.092 --> 22:24.424
Well, if it will
make you feel any better,

22:24.510 --> 22:26.752
I will not be the one
infiltrating the precinct.

22:26.846 --> 22:28.462
That'll be Lyla.

22:28.556 --> 22:30.263
The same Lyla who's also a parent.

22:30.766 --> 22:31.756
And whose husband didn't blink twice

22:31.851 --> 22:34.218
when she volunteered
to go into Diaz's dragon den.

22:34.812 --> 22:35.848
Lyla's a soldier.

22:35.938 --> 22:37.804
Yeah, which is why
she's the one infiltrating

22:37.898 --> 22:39.355
and I'm the one hacking remotely.

22:42.319 --> 22:43.605
I'm not gonna do anything stupid.

22:45.906 --> 22:47.989
- Do we have a problem here?
- No.

22:48.993 --> 22:49.983
Ready when you are.

23:01.714 --> 23:03.580
All I have to do is position this
some place central?

23:03.674 --> 23:06.132
Yes, if Diaz's drive is in that
building, the sniffer will find it.

23:06.468 --> 23:07.800
I can monitor the transfer from here,

23:07.887 --> 23:09.344
but I need this back for the full pull.

23:09.430 --> 23:10.966
How much time do you need
for the transfer?

23:11.056 --> 23:13.013
- A couple of minutes, max.
- Copy that.

23:14.935 --> 23:17.678
- Everybody in position?
- In position.

23:17.771 --> 23:19.728
First hint, if anything's wrong,
signal us.

23:19.899 --> 23:21.310
Copy. We move in five.

23:24.904 --> 23:25.940
Everything okay?

23:26.280 --> 23:29.773
Yeah, it's just that it's so nice to
see how you and John, you know, work.

23:29.867 --> 23:31.779
When you're on the field,
you guys are so in sync.

23:31.869 --> 23:32.985
How do you do it?

23:33.078 --> 23:35.491
You're asking for marital advice now?

23:35.581 --> 23:36.992
Sorry. Yeah, totally terrible timing.

23:37.082 --> 23:39.699
It's just that Oliver doesn't even
want me here,

23:39.793 --> 23:42.410
so I just thought maybe a tip
or two would work.

23:43.881 --> 23:45.747
We always knew our lives
would be high risk.

23:46.258 --> 23:48.500
Eventually, we got to a point where

23:49.345 --> 23:50.756
worrying about that seemed
less important

23:50.846 --> 23:52.712
than enjoying the time we have together.

23:53.098 --> 23:54.839
Even if that was on a battlefield.

23:57.269 --> 24:00.012
Also, getting divorced helps.

24:02.608 --> 24:03.940
(FOOTSTEPS APPROACHING)

24:17.081 --> 24:18.162
Can I help you with something?

24:18.248 --> 24:19.784
Lyla Michaels.

24:20.042 --> 24:21.328
Where can I find your captain?

24:21.669 --> 24:24.286
We're kind of between captains

24:24.421 --> 24:25.832
since our ex-mayor fired the last one.

24:26.090 --> 24:27.376
What's A.R.G.U.S. doing here?

24:27.675 --> 24:29.587
Investigating Ricardo Diaz.

24:29.843 --> 24:30.879
Never heard of him.

24:30.970 --> 24:33.178
Be that as it may, I'm gonna need
to see you CompStat reports

24:33.263 --> 24:34.379
for the last six months.

24:34.473 --> 24:35.589
Hmm.

24:35.808 --> 24:37.765
You do not wanna make me
come back with a warrant.

24:38.310 --> 24:39.596
Wait here.

24:47.778 --> 24:48.768
(BEEPS)

24:50.906 --> 24:53.694
- You're on, Felicity.
- All right, locked on.

24:53.784 --> 24:55.491
- (WHIRRING)
- Give it a few minutes.

24:57.162 --> 24:59.028
Data all seems intact, Mr. Diaz.

24:59.123 --> 25:00.239
(BEEPING)

25:01.083 --> 25:02.619
We got a problem?

25:03.335 --> 25:04.826
I'm not sure.

You better get sure.

25:07.423 --> 25:08.664
Yes, sir.

25:10.384 --> 25:13.047
Guys, the encryption rate,
it's Corto Maltesean in origin.

25:13.137 --> 25:14.253
What does that mean?

25:14.346 --> 25:17.134
I mean, I don't know,
but if I was betting, financial records.

25:17.683 --> 25:20.346
What if these are all Diaz's books?
Everyone he has on his payroll?

25:20.686 --> 25:22.177
We could liberate the city.

25:23.605 --> 25:24.971
Take down his whole operation.

25:29.153 --> 25:31.520

Cloned actually.

25:32.614 --> 25:34.355
- What?
- It's happening on site somehow.

25:35.492 --> 25:37.233
Some bitch from A.R.G.U.S. is here.

25:37.786 --> 25:39.493
She wants to look
at our CompStat reports.

25:40.330 --> 25:41.662
No, she doesn't.

25:42.207 --> 25:43.414
Lyla, we're done. Grab the sniffer.

25:44.835 --> 25:46.918
Agent Michaels, can I talk to you
for a minute?

25:47.671 --> 25:49.082
They're on to us.

25:49.882 --> 25:51.874
Forget the device.
Just get out of there.

25:59.433 --> 26:01.015
Director Michaels,

26:01.310 --> 26:03.222
I heard you're interested in me.

26:04.354 --> 26:05.561
Honey,

26:06.398 --> 26:07.605
you better get in here.

26:08.442 --> 26:09.728

Hey!

26:43.102 --> 26:44.388
Sorry! I'm sorry!

27:02.412 --> 27:04.369
That was an all-out fight with the SCPD.

27:04.456 --> 27:05.992
Totally nuts, even by my standards.

27:06.083 --> 27:07.119
Yes, but it was the only option though.

27:07.209 --> 27:08.666
I mean,
this was too important not to get.

27:08.752 --> 27:10.914
How would you even know?
This is supposed to be encrypted.

27:11.004 --> 27:13.212
Well, you can just call me an optimist
because I'm thinking

27:13.298 --> 27:14.789
in two to three hours,
all of us are gonna be extremely happy.

27:15.259 --> 27:16.966
Can you gather information
as it decrypts?

27:17.052 --> 27:18.338
It would be nice
to get a jump on things.

27:18.428 --> 27:19.714
Oh, no, no, no. No, no, no.

27:20.430 --> 27:22.592
This is an all or nothing
type deal, okay?

27:22.683 --> 27:25.642
We go in mid-decryption
and the whole drive wipes.

27:25.769 --> 27:27.761
- Nothing.
- Felicity, may I speak with you?

27:28.230 --> 27:29.266
Yes.

27:37.322 --> 27:39.109
I'm just gonna take a wild guess

27:39.283 --> 27:40.774
and say that this isn't
one of those conversations

27:40.868 --> 27:42.780
that starts with like,
"I love you, you were brave,

27:42.870 --> 27:43.986
"you go, that was awesome."

27:44.079 --> 27:47.447
No, this is a conversation that
happens because I love you.

27:47.875 --> 27:48.911
Okay.

27:49.084 --> 27:50.495
You promised me you would stay put.

27:50.586 --> 27:52.077
Well, I didn't exactly promise.

27:52.171 --> 27:54.037
Fine, you promised me
that you wouldn't do anything stupid.

27:54.131 --> 27:55.963
You charged into a firefight.

27:56.049 --> 27:57.460
Which was a calculated risk.

27:57.759 --> 28:00.251
Did you calculate how close
Ricardo Diaz came

28:00.345 --> 28:02.086
to shooting you in the back of the head?

28:02.181 --> 28:03.422
We got what we wanted.

28:03.515 --> 28:04.801
It's not...

28:05.184 --> 28:07.597
And if I'm right, what we wanted

28:07.686 --> 28:10.724
has the list of everyone in the city
that Diaz controls.

28:13.192 --> 28:15.775
This could help us get our home
back from Diaz, Oliver.

28:16.695 --> 28:18.937
We could actually save our city
this time around.

28:19.948 --> 28:22.281
I think that's a little bit more
important than what ifs.

28:22.367 --> 28:24.108
This is why I started working
alone again.

28:24.203 --> 28:25.364
Yeah.

28:25.454 --> 28:26.695
You know what?
I tried convincing myself

28:26.788 --> 28:28.700
that that was the right move too,
but it's not

28:28.790 --> 28:29.997
because we're married.

28:30.083 --> 28:31.915
And we're supposed to be
each other's strength.

28:32.461 --> 28:34.373
So there is no alone for us anymore.

28:34.463 --> 28:36.170
It's not that simple and you know it.

28:36.256 --> 28:38.373
God, I'm really gonna start needing
you to see it that way.

28:48.477 --> 28:50.469
Hey. What the hell are you doing here?

28:50.687 --> 28:52.724
I heard Felicity might have got hold
of Diaz's payroll,

28:52.814 --> 28:54.350
so I hitched a ride back with John.

28:54.608 --> 28:55.689
I can help with the decryption. (GRUNTS)

28:55.776 --> 28:57.813
Whoa, whoa, Curtis. Hey, are you crazy?

28:57.903 --> 28:59.485

29:03.158 --> 29:04.444
I'll nap later.

29:04.868 --> 29:09.112
He also made you almost bleed out,
so I need you to stop, okay?

29:10.040 --> 29:11.451
Curtis.

29:11.708 --> 29:13.700
How is me resting gonna help
anything, Dinah?

29:13.794 --> 29:16.628
Okay. But being reckless isn't
gonna help anything either.

29:16.797 --> 29:18.834
He almost killed my man.

29:19.299 --> 29:21.040
What do you expect my reaction to be?

29:21.301 --> 29:23.008
Exactly the same as mine.

29:23.845 --> 29:25.177
I'm sorry, I...

29:26.139 --> 29:28.506
I wasn't thinking about Vincent.
I'm so sorry, Dinah.

29:28.976 --> 29:30.763
You shouldn't be thinking about Vincent.

29:30.852 --> 29:32.684
You need to be thinking about Nick.

29:40.404 --> 29:41.815
Remember how you had to talk me down?

29:41.905 --> 29:44.443
I remember my advice not really taking.

29:44.533 --> 29:46.650
(CHUCKLES) Yeah.

29:47.536 --> 29:48.947
But you're a lot smarter than me.

29:50.706 --> 29:52.789
Look, Nick is lying
in a hospital bed right now.

29:53.250 --> 29:55.833
If you don't take it easy,
you're gonna end up right back in one.

29:56.211 --> 29:58.498
We got this. Go be with him.

30:01.466 --> 30:04.334
That's absurd. Why would I tip off
the Green Arrow

30:04.428 --> 30:05.669
only to save you from him?

30:05.929 --> 30:07.170
You tell me.

30:07.431 --> 30:10.174
You're delusional.
You ought to be thanking me.

30:10.767 --> 30:12.929
I hacked, and I hacked,

30:13.312 --> 30:15.520
and I back-traced where
Felicity Smoak took your clone data.

30:15.605 --> 30:17.392
We can get there before she decrypts it.

- War?

and a hospital.

30:27.117 --> 30:29.609
To say nothing about what happened
in your own police station.

30:29.703 --> 30:30.864
Your point?

30:31.038 --> 30:34.372
You're out of control
and out of your depth, Ricardo.

into the Quadrant because...

is only at about 40%.

30:56.521 --> 30:58.558
I'm sure she's working
as fast as she can.

30:58.648 --> 30:59.684
JOHN: Well, I'm quite sure she is,

30:59.775 --> 31:01.391
but maybe we need to come up
with a backup plan

31:01.485 --> 31:03.351
just in case this doesn't pan out
the way we think.

31:03.445 --> 31:04.936
I agree.

31:05.030 --> 31:06.817
And I'm open to suggestions.

31:09.951 --> 31:11.442
The first thing is

31:12.287 --> 31:14.153
figuring out what is going on
in your head.

31:14.331 --> 31:16.368
Yeah, what else you guys talk about?

31:16.458 --> 31:18.245

31:19.836 --> 31:21.327
but, Oliver, I really didn't need to.

Everyone can see the tension
between the two of you.

31:23.256 --> 31:25.418
Well, John, I asked her
not to go into the field.

31:26.968 --> 31:28.334
And she did.

31:28.553 --> 31:31.045
And I'm sorry that she thinks
I'm changing the rules for her,

31:31.139 --> 31:35.008

like things aren't different.

that I had spread myself too thin,

And I took it to heart
and I made some changes.

31:57.833 --> 32:00.576
She went into the field tonight,
she split my focus

32:00.794 --> 32:02.660

both of us killed.

38:11.623 --> 38:13.615
I shouldn't have pushed you away.

38:14.167 --> 38:17.751
I should have trusted you
to keep yourself safe,

38:17.837 --> 38:22.798
and I should have trusted my abilities
to help keep you safe.

38:23.635 --> 38:25.501
- Thank you.
- Yeah.

38:26.930 --> 38:30.469
It's good to know after all these years
that you can still learn something.

38:31.267 --> 38:32.678
You know, I still have ways to go.

38:32.811 --> 38:34.052
That's true.

38:36.606 --> 38:38.313
(SIGHS) So what now?

38:40.235 --> 38:41.771
(SIGHS)

38:41.861 --> 38:42.977
I have an idea.

38:47.784 --> 38:49.275
Thank you for coming.

38:50.370 --> 38:55.286
I asked you here because we lost
another Quadrant member last night.

38:57.043 --> 38:59.956
You see, I don't mind partners

39:01.840 --> 39:03.001
when they're loyal.

39:04.884 --> 39:08.548
It turns out Miss Cassamento wasn't.

39:09.764 --> 39:11.756
So what I have to decide right now

39:12.976 --> 39:17.812
is whether you two
fall into that same category.

39:17.939 --> 39:20.647
You wanted in the Quadrant, you're in.

39:21.526 --> 39:23.313
This doesn't have to be adversarial.

39:23.903 --> 39:25.144
See, that's the thing.

39:26.197 --> 39:27.654
Me wanting in,

39:29.242 --> 39:30.699
I always thought

39:31.661 --> 39:32.868
that I wanted that.

39:33.413 --> 39:34.949
And I realized,

39:36.457 --> 39:38.699
it's just not enough.

39:39.043 --> 39:41.080
You don't want a partnership.

39:41.880 --> 39:44.372
You want a controlling stake.

39:47.635 --> 39:48.967
Guilty.

39:50.263 --> 39:51.470
(GRUNTS)

39:53.725 --> 39:55.307
Let's try this again.

39:55.810 --> 39:57.301
May I?

39:59.647 --> 40:01.559
We have the Quadrant's resources.

40:02.358 --> 40:03.565
We got its muscle,

40:04.611 --> 40:06.102
its connections.

40:10.909 --> 40:12.650
All I need

40:14.787 --> 40:16.369
is loyalty.

40:18.583 --> 40:20.575
The Quadrant's running out of members.

40:22.170 --> 40:23.661
Do I have it?

40:38.686 --> 40:41.269
OLIVER: So far,
Ricardo Diaz has been unstoppable.

40:42.690 --> 40:43.680
He has aligned himself

40:43.775 --> 40:46.893
with the most powerful
criminal organization in the country.

40:47.362 --> 40:50.196
He controls Star City's government,
its infrastructure

40:50.281 --> 40:51.988
and its police force.

40:54.077 --> 40:56.490
I can't stop him on my own.

40:59.374 --> 41:01.707
And when you say you can't stop him,

41:01.793 --> 41:04.035
are you speaking as the former mayor

41:04.963 --> 41:06.420
or as someone else?

41:10.134 --> 41:12.046
You want my help,

41:12.136 --> 41:14.093
I'm gonna need two things from you.

41:14.806 --> 41:16.263
The first is,

41:16.349 --> 41:18.011
I'm gonna need you to say the words.

41:21.521 --> 41:23.012
I am the Green Arrow.

41:23.982 --> 41:26.315
And the truth shall set you free.

41:26.651 --> 41:28.187
What's the second thing?

42:00.351 --> 42:01.341
