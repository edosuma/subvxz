00:36.640 --> 00:41.979
(The Lady in Dignity)

00:49.049 --> 00:51.090
She's okay with leaving that painting up on our wall?

00:52.060 --> 00:53.630
Is she Mother Teresa or what?

00:54.729 --> 00:56.799
Or does she not love her husband at all?

00:58.000 --> 00:59.429
I don't get her.

01:10.079 --> 01:11.439
That woman...

01:12.310 --> 01:13.810
How dare she lay a hand on my woman?

01:47.709 --> 01:49.379
Father called me.

01:50.120 --> 01:52.980
He wants you to manage the factory rent now on.

01:55.590 --> 01:58.620
We're planning to move out.

02:00.090 --> 02:02.030
We were going to live on our own anyway.

02:02.489 --> 02:03.659
We already bought a place too.

02:04.129 --> 02:07.230
You should look after everything in the house from now on.

02:10.068 --> 02:12.870
All right, I will.

02:15.870 --> 02:18.039
By the way, where are you moving to?

02:30.990 --> 02:32.020
Honey.

02:34.159 --> 02:36.490
A Jin and her family want to live on their own.

02:37.030 --> 02:38.860
- What? - To tell you the truth,

02:39.159 --> 02:41.370
there has been a little problem.

02:43.069 --> 02:44.900
Jae Seok has been having an affair.

02:45.699 --> 02:46.710
What did you just say?

02:47.009 --> 02:50.009
You're very fond of A Jin.

02:50.080 --> 02:52.080
I know that better than anyone else does.

02:52.439 --> 02:54.750
Plus, this is a crucial time for the company,

02:54.810 --> 02:56.150
as you're well aware.

02:56.650 --> 02:59.650
I thought that the situation could get really bad because he's...

02:59.650 --> 03:01.819
the one who's practically in charge of the company now,

03:01.990 --> 03:03.419
so I got involved a little.

03:03.490 --> 03:05.490
What are you talking about? Be more specific.

03:06.460 --> 03:11.159
As soon as I heard that Jae Seok is having an affair,

03:11.400 --> 03:13.800
I went over to his mistress' place.

03:14.229 --> 03:15.229
And?

03:15.500 --> 03:20.000
Well, she has a nice body and she's pretty.

03:20.069 --> 03:21.069
She's young too.

03:21.069 --> 03:23.340
Overall, she lacks morals,

03:23.409 --> 03:25.310
but I have to admit that she's hot.

03:25.509 --> 03:27.849
Gosh, that punk. Is he out of his mind?

03:27.879 --> 03:29.379
He can't be philandering now.

03:30.780 --> 03:33.789
I think she's the artist whose painting...

03:34.250 --> 03:37.419
was used in our products' packaging.

03:37.460 --> 03:38.460
What?

03:39.189 --> 03:42.229
I saw many paintings at her place.

03:44.000 --> 03:45.360
So...

03:46.159 --> 03:48.229
are you saying that he pushed to put the image...

03:48.400 --> 03:51.469
of that cartoon-like painting on all of our products...

03:51.900 --> 03:53.270
because of that woman?

03:53.669 --> 03:56.169
It looks like their relationship is quite serious.

03:56.240 --> 04:00.009
How can he run the company when his mind is elsewhere?

04:00.550 --> 04:01.879
He must be...

04:02.310 --> 04:05.080
very distracted now.

04:05.479 --> 04:07.990
Where's that punk now? That crazy moron.

04:08.490 --> 04:10.090
I entrusted him with the company...

04:10.090 --> 04:11.590
because he's the best one out of my children.

04:12.120 --> 04:13.189
How can he cheat on A Jin?

04:14.360 --> 04:15.389
Did you trespass on...

04:15.490 --> 04:18.000
someone's property at Room 306 in Kiam Apartment?

04:18.029 --> 04:19.029
Someone damaged the property...

04:19.500 --> 04:21.870
and insulted as well as physically assaulted a young lady...

04:21.970 --> 04:23.370
who has no ability to defend herself.

04:23.540 --> 04:26.540
Was it your doing?

04:27.439 --> 04:29.509
- You punk! - Dad!

04:29.509 --> 04:30.540
You punk. You moron.

04:30.540 --> 04:32.610
Dad, why are you being like this?

04:32.610 --> 04:35.149
Are you having an affair? Have you been cheating on A Jin?

04:35.579 --> 04:37.149
You piece of...

04:38.279 --> 04:39.649
You almost ripped my mouth off.

04:39.649 --> 04:41.319
You crazy punk. You must've gone insane.

04:41.319 --> 04:43.790
You should've at least made sure to hide it from Ji Hu and A Jin.

04:43.790 --> 04:44.819
What on earth were you thinking?

04:44.819 --> 04:47.029
Why don't you advertise it on the newspaper?

04:47.129 --> 04:48.889
Dad, why are you being like this?

04:48.990 --> 04:51.800
You, out of all people, should understand me.

04:52.060 --> 04:53.500
What? Have you completely lost your mind?

04:53.500 --> 04:54.899
Gosh, seriously!

04:55.000 --> 04:57.699
You've always done everything you wanted to do.

04:57.699 --> 04:59.399
How many affairs have you had?

04:59.399 --> 05:01.569
You prick. Are you saying that...

05:01.569 --> 05:02.610
you're having an affair because I did?

05:02.610 --> 05:04.779
No, that's not what I meant. What I'm saying is that...

05:04.779 --> 05:06.779
you out of all people, shouldn't criticize me.

05:06.779 --> 05:08.879
Men must have a sense of responsibility and commitment.

05:09.149 --> 05:11.180
How can you philander when you have a wife and a kid?

05:11.180 --> 05:12.819
Dad, please don't be like this.

05:13.149 --> 05:14.319
Just help me out, okay?

05:14.420 --> 05:16.149
What? Help you out?

05:16.149 --> 05:18.220
I love that woman.

05:18.220 --> 05:20.060
- Which woman? - That woman.

05:20.060 --> 05:22.430
- Be specific. Which one? - The new one.

05:22.430 --> 05:24.129
You piece of... What? "The new one"?

05:24.129 --> 05:25.829
Are you saying A Jin is old and ragged or what?

05:25.829 --> 05:28.300
You little piece of shit. How dare you say such a thing?

05:28.300 --> 05:30.569
Just die. I want you gone from my sight.

05:30.899 --> 05:34.569
Dad! You must know what it's like because you've been in love too.

05:34.569 --> 05:36.639
I can't control my heart.

05:36.639 --> 05:39.709
It's not like you fell in love with her because you wanted to.

05:39.709 --> 05:42.779
You know better than anyone else that we can't control these things.

05:42.779 --> 05:46.819
That woman just walked into my life out of nowhere one day.

05:46.819 --> 05:48.149
End it immediately!

05:48.850 --> 05:51.319
Then get down on your knees and beg A Jin to forgive you.

05:51.389 --> 05:53.459
No, I can't do that.

05:53.560 --> 05:56.060
Then what? Are you saying that you'll divorce A Jin?

05:56.329 --> 05:59.060
Why would I get divorced? I love that woman.

05:59.060 --> 06:00.170
Which woman?

06:00.370 --> 06:02.529
- That woman. - For God's sake. Which one?

06:02.629 --> 06:05.040
- A Jin. - What a crazy prick.

06:05.300 --> 06:06.339
You punk.

06:06.439 --> 06:07.970
Earlier, you said that it's "the new one".

06:08.069 --> 06:10.240
Now, you're saying that it's A Jin?

06:10.480 --> 06:13.240
Look at you with so many women. Good for you!

06:13.410 --> 06:16.279
Gosh. Stop hitting me, will you?

06:16.350 --> 06:19.120
Why are you getting so mad at me when you have a mistress yourself?

06:19.180 --> 06:22.250
You brat. She's not a mistress.

06:22.250 --> 06:23.290
She's my second wife.

06:23.290 --> 06:25.459
- It's the same thing. - It's clearly different.

06:26.519 --> 06:29.529
If you show up in front of that woman...

06:29.529 --> 06:31.860
and do something like that ever again, I'll teach you a lesson.

06:31.860 --> 06:32.860
You got that?

06:33.160 --> 06:35.199
What? You'll teach her a lesson?

06:35.399 --> 06:37.769
- Who do you think you are? You... - Dad! Gosh...

06:37.870 --> 06:39.699
Stop hitting me, please.

06:39.699 --> 06:43.709
I'll fire you if you don't end it with that woman immediately.

06:44.110 --> 06:45.180
Which one?

06:45.339 --> 06:47.850
Do you think I'm cracking a joke now?

06:47.850 --> 06:48.980
Gosh.

06:53.920 --> 06:57.920
I'll neither get divorced nor break up with that woman.

06:58.220 --> 06:59.889
I'll also work hard to run the company well.

07:01.629 --> 07:02.689
That's it for now.

07:03.600 --> 07:05.629
You... Get back here, you rat.

07:06.629 --> 07:08.100
Gosh, that punk drives me nuts.

07:12.970 --> 07:15.040
Chairman Ahn.

07:15.439 --> 07:18.779
- Yes. - You just walked.

07:19.379 --> 07:21.050
You walked on your own.

07:24.420 --> 07:27.319
Oh, you're right. I did.

07:28.550 --> 07:29.689
My gosh.

07:30.360 --> 07:32.959
Your bratty son did something good for a change.

07:35.529 --> 07:36.529
I'm so happy.

07:36.529 --> 07:37.829
- This makes me really happy. - Okay.

07:38.060 --> 07:41.769
Chairman Ahn, I can't believe it.

07:41.769 --> 07:43.439
Great job.

07:44.300 --> 07:45.639
I wrote my statement and submitted...

07:45.639 --> 07:46.970
the medical certificate to the police.

07:47.939 --> 07:49.610
You could have waited until you get discharged.

07:50.139 --> 07:51.509
I guess you wanted to rush it.

07:52.410 --> 07:54.910
I won't go easy on him. I'll be sure to put him behind bars.

07:55.980 --> 07:58.350
- Sure, do it. - I was torn because of the kid,

07:59.519 --> 08:01.550
but I really can't forgive.

08:03.759 --> 08:07.259
Do whatever you want.

08:08.560 --> 08:10.230
Show me what you can do.

08:11.029 --> 08:12.399
I'm curious too.

08:13.500 --> 08:14.670
What did you just say?

08:15.430 --> 08:16.939
Are you going to hit me here?

08:18.300 --> 08:20.470
You probably don't want people to see it.

08:20.810 --> 08:24.180
If anyone sees it, you might end up behind bars yourself.

08:27.980 --> 08:29.980
Why are you so confident?

08:34.690 --> 08:36.149
How can I be confident?

08:36.549 --> 08:38.759
I guess I'm just used to your abuse now.

08:38.820 --> 08:40.558
That's probably why I'm not as scared anymore.

08:42.058 --> 08:43.429
Take your time.

08:43.629 --> 08:46.299
I have to meet someone today.

08:47.899 --> 08:49.769
I've already completed the discharge procedures.

08:55.509 --> 08:56.879
(Wife)

09:08.889 --> 09:12.090
This...

09:27.840 --> 09:29.009
It must've been rough in there.

09:42.490 --> 09:43.519
My gosh!

09:45.019 --> 09:47.129
Don't. Just stay in my room with me.

09:47.460 --> 09:48.490
Don't go upstairs.

09:54.830 --> 09:55.899
Let's talk.

10:03.440 --> 10:05.580
There's something I must check with you.

10:07.210 --> 10:10.879
You remember the canopy collapsing on Father's birthday, right?

10:12.919 --> 10:15.090
Why are you bringing that up out of the blue?

10:15.450 --> 10:18.019
A Jin showed me a video clip.

10:18.559 --> 10:20.460
In the video, you can clearly see a guy...

10:20.789 --> 10:23.129
doing something to the canopy.

10:26.000 --> 10:28.399
It was easy for us to find out who that guy was.

10:28.799 --> 10:31.169
He's a personal trainer at the gym Father goes to.

10:33.769 --> 10:34.940
Why did he do that?

10:35.110 --> 10:38.279
That guy said that I gave him the order.

10:39.139 --> 10:42.309
Apparently, I told him to make it collapse to hurt you.

10:43.519 --> 10:47.889
Why did you make him do such a thing, Ju Mi?

10:48.590 --> 10:51.759
And why are you telling me this?

10:51.860 --> 10:52.860
After all this time.

10:53.830 --> 10:55.659
How can you even say that?

10:55.759 --> 10:58.600
I know that it was your doing!

11:01.070 --> 11:03.100
Aren't you a professor?

11:03.169 --> 11:08.009
Are you naive or dumb?

11:08.139 --> 11:11.309
Or is your judgment clouded because you're emotional right now?

11:11.379 --> 11:13.750
I know what you're calculating in that head of yours.

11:14.250 --> 11:16.580
You're trying to suffocate all of us...

11:16.649 --> 11:18.820
so that you can have Father wrapped around your finger...

11:18.820 --> 11:20.990
and take control over the entire household.

11:23.389 --> 11:24.690
Do you think we'll let that happen?

11:25.159 --> 11:27.159
Look, Ju Mi.

11:27.629 --> 11:29.129
I guess your husband spending a night...

11:29.129 --> 11:31.299
in the detention room wasn't enough.

11:31.759 --> 11:34.000
Hey, I can easily tell the police...

11:34.100 --> 11:37.000
that the bullet wasn't misfired and that he actually tried to kill me.

11:38.240 --> 11:41.840
If you want to threaten me, do it at the right time.

11:44.509 --> 11:46.179
The canopy incident?

11:47.649 --> 11:50.480
Truth doesn't always win in this world.

11:50.980 --> 11:53.490
What wins becomes the truth.

11:55.049 --> 11:56.120
What did you say?

11:56.120 --> 11:57.960
You just told me...

11:57.960 --> 12:00.789
that the personal trainer said you ordered him to do it.

12:00.960 --> 12:05.000
Then you are the one who told him to do it.

12:06.100 --> 12:07.429
That's how this world works.

12:07.929 --> 12:10.970
You spoiled, clueless rich woman.

12:58.379 --> 12:59.379
Ms. Yun.

12:59.919 --> 13:00.950
Yes, Ms. Seo.

13:01.049 --> 13:03.220
I heard that you've been seeing A Jin's husband.

13:06.019 --> 13:09.190
Well, many girls date married men these days.

13:09.190 --> 13:12.629
But A Jin has done so much for you.

13:13.230 --> 13:14.429
How can you do that to her?

13:14.629 --> 13:17.700
No decent person would ever do such a thing.

13:19.470 --> 13:20.639
It's love.

13:21.340 --> 13:22.610
I couldn't help it.

13:22.870 --> 13:24.039
"Love"?

13:27.049 --> 13:29.710
Is her husband that irresistible?

13:29.980 --> 13:31.649
Enough for you to betray her like this?

13:33.389 --> 13:35.950
Are you wondering why I'm trying to meddle in your personal life?

13:36.220 --> 13:37.259
Yes.

13:38.559 --> 13:39.559
End it.

13:39.789 --> 13:41.289
You better not break A Jin's heart.

13:41.490 --> 13:44.230
I thought you'd understand me.

13:45.230 --> 13:48.129
I mean, you're in the same situation as me.

13:48.730 --> 13:50.500
What on earth are you talking about?

13:50.740 --> 13:52.070
You must know what it's like...

13:52.470 --> 13:54.309
because you've been bashed for the same reason.

13:54.340 --> 13:55.370
Hey.

13:55.870 --> 13:57.039
How dare you.

13:57.480 --> 13:59.240
Did you just insinuate that we're in the same boat?

13:59.340 --> 14:02.049
My paintings are completely separate from my personal life.

14:02.049 --> 14:04.220
You and I belong to different social classes.

14:04.379 --> 14:06.419
You have quite the nerve.

14:06.419 --> 14:07.750
How are we different?

14:08.120 --> 14:13.429
You're a mistress too.

14:18.000 --> 14:19.860
Hey. What?

14:21.230 --> 14:22.269
"Mistress"?

14:24.840 --> 14:25.870
"Mistress"?

14:28.740 --> 14:29.909
Ms. Kim.

14:30.740 --> 14:31.909
Ms. Kim!

14:34.110 --> 14:36.480
- Yes, ma'am. - Take down all of her paintings.

14:37.419 --> 14:39.379
- Pardon? - Did you not hear what I just said?

14:39.679 --> 14:41.919
All six of them. Take them down.

14:42.320 --> 14:45.320
Ms. Seo, I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that way.

14:45.519 --> 14:47.690
Take them down immediately and unframe them.

14:49.730 --> 14:50.759
What's going on?

14:52.129 --> 14:53.870
Ms. Feiko Morinake is here.

14:54.570 --> 14:56.600
What? When did she get here?

14:56.600 --> 14:58.769
She said she'd like to take a look around the gallery quietly...

14:59.940 --> 15:01.470
This is incredible.

15:02.169 --> 15:05.039
This painting is really... How should I put this?

15:05.980 --> 15:08.210
I can't describe it in words, but it's truly perfect.

15:08.409 --> 15:10.419
Shall I say that the whole painting exudes...

15:10.580 --> 15:14.250
a visceral yet indescribable sense of pain...

15:14.250 --> 15:17.289
from scars and wounds of war?

15:17.419 --> 15:19.490
I'd like to purchase this piece,

15:19.789 --> 15:22.289
no matter what the price may be.

15:27.129 --> 15:28.169
Honey.

15:28.399 --> 15:31.399
I've been thinking about going back to school.

15:31.600 --> 15:35.110
I think that it's the only way I can help you.

15:35.970 --> 15:38.139
That will be great. You should do it.

15:40.149 --> 15:41.809
I'm interested...

15:41.809 --> 15:44.980
in the global MBA program at Hanguk University,

15:44.980 --> 15:46.649
but I have to have an executive-level position...

15:46.889 --> 15:50.220
at a company to be considered for admission.

15:50.320 --> 15:52.019
Yes, I'm aware.

15:53.860 --> 15:55.529
That being said...

15:57.159 --> 15:58.330
I'm wondering...

15:58.899 --> 16:00.269
if you can create a position for me...

16:00.269 --> 16:03.269
even if it's nothing official or proper.

16:03.330 --> 16:05.340
Gosh, that's not a problem at all.

16:05.340 --> 16:06.710
Study hard.

16:06.710 --> 16:08.169
You have all my support.

16:09.809 --> 16:12.539
Since I was a kid, I've always had the ability...

16:12.639 --> 16:16.149
to understand way beyond what I was taught.

16:16.149 --> 16:17.320
You don't even need to tell me that.

16:17.649 --> 16:18.980
I know how bright you are.

16:19.179 --> 16:22.190
I'll give people at work a heads-up today,

16:22.289 --> 16:23.320
so go ahead and register right away.

16:24.559 --> 16:25.919
Okay.

16:27.960 --> 16:29.460
You're just so adorable.

16:32.460 --> 16:34.000
It's too early for this.

16:41.139 --> 16:43.809
This room will be perfect as my studio.

16:43.809 --> 16:46.509
It's so spacious. I love it.

16:46.710 --> 16:47.750
That sounds good.

16:47.850 --> 16:49.309
Do you want to check out the bedroom too?

16:49.379 --> 16:50.549
Shall we?

16:52.350 --> 16:53.350
It's this way.

16:57.820 --> 16:59.590
This room is so nice.

16:59.720 --> 17:01.429
It has been ages since I felt like a newlywed.

17:04.500 --> 17:06.529
Someone told me that I'll be very lucky this year.

17:06.529 --> 17:08.529
The lady who bought my painting today is married...

17:08.529 --> 17:10.200
to the CEO of the biggest natto company in Japan.

17:10.598 --> 17:12.440
I heard that she has a keen eye for art.

17:12.440 --> 17:14.608
What an honor. I'm in love with such an amazing artist.

17:15.640 --> 17:19.410
All of these fascinating things only started happening after I met you.

17:20.210 --> 17:22.750
Strictly speaking, you owe it all to A Jin, not me.

17:24.180 --> 17:27.220
You're either absolutely clueless or naive.

17:27.589 --> 17:29.420
I've been told that I'm pure-hearted.

17:29.420 --> 17:30.420
She said that's why she likes me.

17:30.589 --> 17:32.059
- Who's "she"? - A Jin.

17:35.890 --> 17:37.200
Seong Hui. Hey, wait up.

17:37.299 --> 17:38.329
(Exchange rate)

17:38.329 --> 17:39.829
(The value of a nation's currency against another currency.)

17:46.539 --> 17:48.369
What took you so long?

17:48.470 --> 17:50.240
I've been waiting for the right moment.

17:52.180 --> 17:53.680
You seem to be doing great.

17:56.720 --> 17:58.380
You and I go back a long time, you know.

17:59.220 --> 18:01.220
When you first came to the orphanage,

18:02.019 --> 18:05.359
I felt so bad for you, the three-year-old kid who kept crying

18:05.420 --> 18:08.589
that I even saved my food and gave it to you.

18:10.160 --> 18:13.329
Then after I got hired as a bookkeeper at the company...

18:13.529 --> 18:15.900
that supported the orphanage, I even hooked you up with the job...

18:16.000 --> 18:18.000
as the chairman's personal driver.

18:18.299 --> 18:19.640
Why are you bringing that up now?

18:20.309 --> 18:23.339
We embezzled the company funds together seven years ago,

18:24.009 --> 18:27.049
but you dumped everything on me. What did you say to me back then?

18:28.450 --> 18:31.480
You told me that you'll repay me for taking all the blame.

18:32.980 --> 18:34.019
I did say that.

18:37.220 --> 18:41.230
I couldn't get a job after I got out of jail,

18:41.990 --> 18:42.990
so I ended up working

18:44.059 --> 18:45.859
at a bar.

18:47.470 --> 18:48.900
Back then,

18:50.140 --> 18:53.299
I seriously contemplated tracking you down and killing you.

18:54.369 --> 18:55.740
I am sorry about what happened.

18:57.339 --> 18:58.539
I thought that I needed to survive...

18:59.440 --> 19:01.950
to be able to help you.

19:03.109 --> 19:07.190
But I just couldn't hate you.

19:10.990 --> 19:12.019
That day,

19:12.920 --> 19:16.259
you made me a bowl of ramen...

19:16.529 --> 19:18.559
with an egg.

19:20.329 --> 19:22.170
And for some odd reason, that bowl of ramen...

19:24.000 --> 19:25.500
felt like your sincere heart.

19:27.539 --> 19:29.869
Then you apologized to me...

19:30.710 --> 19:34.880
and gave me 80 dollars which was all you had.

19:38.049 --> 19:39.380
That day,

19:40.990 --> 19:42.490
I forgave you.

19:43.089 --> 19:45.259
That's why I got you that big gig.

19:51.630 --> 19:52.660
You know what?

19:55.170 --> 19:57.400
I hope that you're a loyal person.

19:58.799 --> 20:00.509
I'll look after you if that's the case.

20:01.670 --> 20:02.869
Show me your loyalty.

20:02.970 --> 20:05.140
What more do you want me to do?

20:09.509 --> 20:12.349
Finish what you already started without any mistakes.

20:21.829 --> 20:24.460
(Yun Jae's mom)

20:35.970 --> 20:37.680
Why can't I put this on?

20:40.450 --> 20:41.480
Seong Su.

20:42.279 --> 20:44.980
Let's not see each other for the next little while.

20:45.680 --> 20:46.720
Why?

20:46.720 --> 20:47.720
My husband is out of the hospital now.

20:48.349 --> 20:50.059
He's getting discharged sooner than I thought.

20:50.059 --> 20:51.420
You said he'd be there for 12 weeks.

20:51.519 --> 20:54.529
Apparently, he recovered quickly because he used to be an athlete.

20:55.859 --> 20:57.200
The fact that he's been discharged...

20:57.200 --> 20:58.529
doesn't mean we can't see each other.

21:02.700 --> 21:03.900
I'm pregnant.

21:11.240 --> 21:13.240
You said that you're infertile.

21:13.950 --> 21:15.009
I know.

21:16.380 --> 21:17.720
I thought I was.

21:20.049 --> 21:22.049
- When did you find out? - A few days ago.

21:26.289 --> 21:27.630
Whose kid, is it?

21:28.529 --> 21:29.690
I'm not sure.

21:30.559 --> 21:32.059
We'll find out when the baby is born.

21:32.829 --> 21:34.000
I'll head out first.

21:47.150 --> 21:49.210
It looked like you were shopping to let off some steam.

21:49.910 --> 21:51.079
What's going on?

21:53.750 --> 21:54.750
Hyo Ju.

21:55.589 --> 21:57.089
My husband is cheating on me.

21:57.490 --> 21:58.519
My gosh.

21:58.789 --> 22:00.490
- Are you serious? - Should I kill him?

22:04.859 --> 22:06.700
How have you been putting up with it?

22:09.329 --> 22:11.170
An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth.

22:12.170 --> 22:13.910
I got myself a boyfriend too.

22:14.539 --> 22:16.539
You know what's funny though?

22:17.339 --> 22:21.349
You'll totally understand your husband when you get a boyfriend.

22:22.210 --> 22:23.579
It's exciting.

22:24.779 --> 22:26.619
A young guy.

22:27.220 --> 22:30.390
Seeing him helps me keep my hormones in balance.

22:31.690 --> 22:33.529
It's definitely not something money can buy me.

22:33.990 --> 22:35.059
So what?

22:35.460 --> 22:37.299
Are you suggesting that I should have an affair too?

22:37.829 --> 22:39.829
That's not what I meant.

22:40.799 --> 22:43.569
I have another son. He's older than Jeong Hyeon.

22:44.640 --> 22:45.670
I know that.

22:46.339 --> 22:47.710
I mean, who doesn't?

22:48.039 --> 22:49.869
I'm raising an ill child.

22:50.779 --> 22:52.609
Are you saying I should...

22:53.109 --> 22:54.450
have an affair just like what his father is doing?

22:56.609 --> 23:00.289
Why are you talking about your son? You're making me feel bad.

23:03.089 --> 23:04.119
Let's be honest though.

23:04.519 --> 23:08.029
Moms must feel at ease without any resentment or anger...

23:08.460 --> 23:10.299
to be able to raise their children well.

23:13.430 --> 23:15.130
How am I going to see that girl's face tomorrow?

23:15.400 --> 23:17.240
Are you meeting that girl tomorrow?

23:17.299 --> 23:19.299
We have our brunch tomorrow, you know.

23:23.640 --> 23:24.640
Are you saying...

23:25.440 --> 23:27.309
that one of our members...

23:28.180 --> 23:31.019
is seeing your husband?

23:40.829 --> 23:41.859
A Jin.

23:43.289 --> 23:44.460
A Jin.

23:46.630 --> 23:47.970
A Jin, are you okay?

23:49.170 --> 23:50.200
Yes.

23:50.700 --> 23:52.039
This helps me let off some steam.

23:53.539 --> 23:54.869
Is Jae Seok not home yet?

23:56.069 --> 23:57.579
What does my schedule look like tomorrow?

23:58.539 --> 24:00.579
You have the brunch tomorrow.

24:01.779 --> 24:03.480
I'm not in the mood to go to that thing.

24:31.740 --> 24:32.740
Hey, Hyo Ju.

24:33.079 --> 24:35.109
- How have you been? - Good. How are things with you?

24:36.950 --> 24:38.980
- You guys are early. - Hey, you made it.

24:39.380 --> 24:41.390
- Hello. - Hello.

24:47.690 --> 24:48.730
Thank you.

24:51.660 --> 24:53.670
Is this sharp enough to kill someone?

24:58.170 --> 25:00.000
I was just curious. Don't mind me.

25:01.569 --> 25:05.410
This will be the last brunch I'm attending.

25:06.210 --> 25:07.579
I'm selling the institute.

25:07.779 --> 25:11.119
I've concluded that it contradicts with my educational philosophy,

25:11.250 --> 25:12.420
so that's it.

25:13.890 --> 25:16.049
We're sorry to hear that.

25:16.519 --> 25:17.519
Don't be.

25:18.660 --> 25:22.329
Then please tutor our kids. We can pay you however much you'd like.

25:23.329 --> 25:25.329
- Which kids? - What do you think?

25:25.900 --> 25:28.230
Su Min, Jeong Hyeon, and Ji Hu. Just those three.

25:30.200 --> 25:31.700
Why are you excluding Yun Jae?

25:34.609 --> 25:35.640
Why should we include him?

25:36.369 --> 25:38.710
I'm speechless. What kind of question is that?

25:38.940 --> 25:40.079
What does that even mean?

25:40.579 --> 25:43.579
We let you join us even though you're far below our league.

25:43.920 --> 25:44.920
Let's be honest here.

25:45.420 --> 25:47.420
Yun Jae isn't even your son.

25:47.920 --> 25:49.750
Gi Ok, you're out of line.

25:49.849 --> 25:51.359
What is this about?

25:51.589 --> 25:52.960
You better watch what you say.

25:52.960 --> 25:54.329
You came from nothing.

25:54.329 --> 25:57.000
I guess you feel like you've made it now that you're living in Gangnam,

25:57.099 --> 25:58.430
acting like you belong to the upper class.

25:58.430 --> 26:01.769
Do you think you can change the fact that you came from nothing...

26:01.970 --> 26:04.299
by raising someone else's child and acting like you're one of us?

26:05.069 --> 26:06.240
Absolutely not.

26:06.539 --> 26:09.869
A dirty rag is still a dirty rag no matter how many times you wash it.

26:10.109 --> 26:12.079
What? "A dirty rag"?

26:12.710 --> 26:15.079
Gi Ok, I don't think you should be talking about this here.

26:15.279 --> 26:18.450
Gyeong Hui and you should talk about it some other time. Stop now.

26:18.450 --> 26:19.650
Yes, this isn't a good idea.

26:19.750 --> 26:22.750
Hey, I heard that you used to make announcements at a racetrack.

26:23.460 --> 26:25.160
And what? You used to be an announcer at a broadcasting station?

26:25.160 --> 26:26.660
What a liar.

26:26.759 --> 26:27.759
Did you just call me a liar?

26:29.329 --> 26:31.160
How shameless.

26:31.160 --> 26:32.400
Look who's talking.

26:32.900 --> 26:35.299
You said you worked as a pharmacist...

26:35.299 --> 26:36.299
at the hospital your husband used to work.

26:36.970 --> 26:39.640
You told us that you met your doctor husband at the university hospital.

26:40.509 --> 26:42.009
Which university?

26:43.039 --> 26:45.109
Did you go to pharmacy school in the Philippines?

26:46.339 --> 26:47.349
You didn't think...

26:47.750 --> 26:50.250
I'd know you went to high school and college there?

26:50.619 --> 26:51.619
I also know that you went...

26:51.720 --> 26:53.890
to a community college that accepts anybody who pays.

26:54.950 --> 26:57.789
Pharmacist, my foot. Have some conscience.

26:58.990 --> 27:01.289
Who told you that I went to college in the Philippines?

27:01.460 --> 27:04.299
I'm pretty sure that everyone knows. Don't you all know about it?

27:04.299 --> 27:05.460
Please. That's enough.

27:05.460 --> 27:06.660
- Excuse me! - Yes.

27:07.130 --> 27:09.329
I don't think we can eat today. Please cancel our orders.

27:09.400 --> 27:10.900
But we already started making them.

27:11.000 --> 27:12.000
Did my husband tell you?

27:12.339 --> 27:14.009
Did Seong Su tell you that? Answer me.

27:15.710 --> 27:17.380
Is he good in bed?

27:18.410 --> 27:20.579
- Where do you think you're going? - Put this down, please.

27:20.680 --> 27:21.750
Why are you being like this?

27:21.950 --> 27:24.119
What? Did your abusive husband...

27:24.119 --> 27:25.480
make you miss being with a sweet guy?

27:25.579 --> 27:26.950
Is that why you seduced my husband?

27:26.950 --> 27:28.319
That's right. I seduced him.

27:28.750 --> 27:31.089
He's sweet and he said that he's crazy about me.

27:31.089 --> 27:32.089
That's why I fell for him.

27:34.490 --> 27:35.930
Gyeong Hui, just get out of here.

27:36.430 --> 27:38.730
No, I won't. Bring it on.

27:38.960 --> 27:41.599
What is wrong with you? You're in no position to be provoking her.

27:41.599 --> 27:43.130
Gyeong Hui, don't be like this.

27:43.539 --> 27:45.200
Cut it out, okay?

27:45.200 --> 27:47.210
You're in no position to be lecturing me. Aren't I right?

27:47.210 --> 27:48.910
- You know that I'm right. - What did you say?

27:49.509 --> 27:51.509
You fell for him because he's crazy about you?

27:51.509 --> 27:54.910
That's right. He told me that I smell like cherry blossom.

27:55.049 --> 27:57.049
He said he feels pure in heart when he sees me...

27:57.049 --> 27:58.380
and that I make him feel like a man.

28:02.950 --> 28:04.319
Gosh, you crazy...

28:46.000 --> 28:47.670
Stop!

28:48.000 --> 28:50.900
I'm pregnant!

28:51.069 --> 28:52.839
I'm pregnant!

28:58.680 --> 28:59.779
Get off me!

29:19.660 --> 29:20.829
That day,

29:21.230 --> 29:25.900
at their last brunch together, she got a good look at her reality.

29:26.039 --> 29:29.210
She also saw what she should be doing,

29:29.670 --> 29:33.009
but absolutely must not do at the same time.

29:33.349 --> 29:36.380
Here at Hanguk University's Global Education Center,

29:36.980 --> 29:40.049
our goal is to cultivate global leaders with the power...

29:40.319 --> 29:41.950
and ability to transform the economic uncertainty...

29:42.349 --> 29:44.420
that has prevailed all over the globe...

29:44.690 --> 29:46.990
into golden opportunities.

29:50.700 --> 29:51.700
Hello.

29:52.059 --> 29:54.529
I'm Han Min Gi, the CEO of MK Capital.

29:55.430 --> 29:56.430
My name is Bok...

29:58.339 --> 30:01.039
I'm Park Ji Yeong.

30:01.509 --> 30:03.509
- I see, Ms. Park Ji Yeong. - Yes.

30:03.539 --> 30:04.539
Do you have a business card?

30:05.740 --> 30:07.450
I'll give it to you in the next class.

30:15.119 --> 30:18.960
This wine was produced in the Chianti region in Tuscany, Italy.

30:19.220 --> 30:20.559
It was made by Zonin.

30:20.930 --> 30:22.089
The name of this wine is...

30:22.329 --> 30:25.400
Castello d'Albola Chianti Classico Riserva.

30:26.869 --> 30:28.569
- It's hard to remember, isn't it? - Yes.

30:28.700 --> 30:30.000
Please repeat after me.

30:30.539 --> 30:33.200
- Castello d'Albola. - Castello d'Albola.

30:33.200 --> 30:36.240
Those in the upper class studied ceaselessly.

30:36.779 --> 30:39.940
They put in their utmost effort in order to maintain...

30:40.079 --> 30:41.750
their social status...

30:41.950 --> 30:44.150
and the effort they made was on another level...

30:44.250 --> 30:47.420
compared to the lower class' effort for survival.

30:48.450 --> 30:49.789
They believed...

30:50.289 --> 30:53.960
that all of their endeavors will ensure their survival...

30:54.130 --> 30:56.960
even if their lives were to crumble.

31:09.539 --> 31:10.539
I'm sorry.

31:10.609 --> 31:11.980
Please continue with the consultation.

31:28.059 --> 31:29.829
When would you like to book...

31:34.930 --> 31:36.099
Is it your child?

31:36.740 --> 31:37.740
It's not, right?

31:38.500 --> 31:39.539
I don't know.

31:40.609 --> 31:42.309
- What? - I don't know either.

31:42.309 --> 31:44.309
- I'm going crazy. - Why are you going crazy?

31:45.210 --> 31:48.049
Because it might be yours? Or are you afraid that it may not be yours?

31:48.109 --> 31:50.279
- What do you think? - You son of...

31:51.680 --> 31:53.019
How...

31:53.519 --> 31:55.349
can you stab me in the back like this?

31:55.619 --> 31:57.460
I'm sorry. I was going to end it.

31:57.619 --> 31:58.960
Did you love her?

31:59.319 --> 32:00.329
Love, my foot.

32:00.660 --> 32:03.660
What was it, then? You cheated on me with someone you don't even love?

32:03.700 --> 32:06.200
We met her through our son, for goodness' sake.

32:06.559 --> 32:10.569
You should've done it with some hostess so that I'd never find out!

32:10.569 --> 32:12.400
We met as a doctor and a patient first.

32:12.869 --> 32:14.539
I was happy to see her again at the get-together.

32:18.910 --> 32:20.250
You were happy to see her again?

32:20.809 --> 32:22.809
How dare you say that to my face?

32:22.980 --> 32:25.650
Let's talk at home. This is my workplace. This looks really bad.

32:25.650 --> 32:27.490
You at least know that you should be embarrassed.

32:27.490 --> 32:29.319
That's why I'm holding back.

32:29.619 --> 32:31.660
I want to rip you to pieces right now,

32:32.559 --> 32:34.259
but you have to see your patients...

32:34.460 --> 32:36.589
in order for us to raise Jeong Woo in a good environment...

32:37.200 --> 32:39.329
and send Jeong Hyeon to a school abroad!

32:39.859 --> 32:42.529
That's exactly it! I'm nothing but a money-making machine to you.

32:42.599 --> 32:44.769
What am I to you? What am I to our family?

32:44.869 --> 32:46.299
I perform the same surgery all day long.

32:46.400 --> 32:48.440
I studied so hard to get into and finish medical school.

32:48.539 --> 32:51.640
Now, I'm working like a dog to give you and our sons a comfortable life.

32:51.740 --> 32:54.349
Let me get away with this much at least!

32:55.349 --> 32:57.019
I'm going to stop here. You should go.

33:05.789 --> 33:06.859
(Agreement to Withdraw Charges)

33:06.960 --> 33:09.130
Why did you decide to drop the charges all of a sudden?

33:15.369 --> 33:18.539
Can a woman file charges against her husband for hitting her?

33:18.539 --> 33:19.539
Of course.

33:19.539 --> 33:22.710
The Women and Youth Bureau deals with such cases, not us.

33:27.210 --> 33:28.710
(Complainant Kim Bong Sik)

33:34.250 --> 33:35.589
Gosh, that prick.

33:35.819 --> 33:38.660
He must think he can be that arrogant because he's rich.

33:38.920 --> 33:40.559
I bet he hit his wife.

33:41.490 --> 33:42.829
I'm 100 percent sure.

33:45.029 --> 33:46.829
What a jerk.

33:50.240 --> 33:53.240
My baby is okay, right?

33:54.170 --> 33:55.509
Yes, of course.

33:58.410 --> 34:00.450
You said that your son is in the third grade.

34:01.250 --> 34:03.250
I have no doubt that he'll be a great big brother.

34:20.599 --> 34:22.429
Hey, what happened to your face?

34:22.929 --> 34:24.768
Your wife did this to me.

34:24.940 --> 34:28.110
You need to fix this because your wife made me like this.

34:28.170 --> 34:30.179
Show me. Did she scratch your face with her nails?

34:33.949 --> 34:35.949
What? It's a burn.

34:36.150 --> 34:37.650
What if it scars?

34:38.550 --> 34:39.550
This won't scar.

34:40.150 --> 34:42.489
I'll give you an ointment. Make sure you apply it religiously.

34:42.489 --> 34:46.320
Thank goodness you're a plastic surgeon.

34:48.590 --> 34:49.760
I'm sorry.

34:50.659 --> 34:53.699
Whom do you feel more apologetic toward?

34:54.170 --> 34:55.670
Me or your wife?

34:58.840 --> 35:00.000
Seong Su.

35:00.639 --> 35:03.139
Take responsibility for what you've done.

35:04.880 --> 35:06.039
Were you just scared?

35:07.210 --> 35:08.579
What are you talking about?

35:09.079 --> 35:11.579
We don't even know whether the baby is mine or not.

35:11.579 --> 35:12.750
It is yours.

35:13.650 --> 35:15.050
I don't sleep with my husband.

35:17.190 --> 35:18.360
Are you serious?

35:18.360 --> 35:19.860
What should I do now?

35:30.539 --> 35:32.039
Please be careful with them.

35:32.400 --> 35:33.940
Those paintings are at least...

35:34.010 --> 35:35.710
10 times more expensive than furniture pieces,

35:35.769 --> 35:37.079
so please be very gentle.

35:37.280 --> 35:39.110
- No problem. - You be careful too, okay?

36:00.400 --> 36:02.769
You may find it hard to believe,

36:03.570 --> 36:04.900
but I like you, A Jin.

36:07.070 --> 36:09.510
Yes, I do find that hard to believe.

36:12.346 --> 36:13.346
Shall we clink our glasses?

36:21.015 --> 36:23.685
In life, we encounter many things...

36:24.486 --> 36:27.656
that we have no control over.

36:28.055 --> 36:30.426
Actually, we rarely encounter things that we can control...

36:31.066 --> 36:32.426
in life.

36:32.596 --> 36:34.596
Is your husband one of those things?

36:41.535 --> 36:44.046
I guess you're just going to let it slide.

36:45.576 --> 36:47.875
You said you guys will move out. Isn't that what it means?

36:49.015 --> 36:51.015
I'm assuming that Jae Seok will move out with you.

36:53.216 --> 36:54.886
I no longer consider him my husband,

36:55.756 --> 36:58.426
but Ji Hu still needs a dad.

37:01.756 --> 37:04.566
He also said that he won't get divorced.

37:05.366 --> 37:07.035
He told Chairman Ahn...

37:07.665 --> 37:09.765
that he'll never get divorced.

37:11.265 --> 37:12.305
Does Father know about it too?

37:13.676 --> 37:15.176
I told him.

37:16.335 --> 37:18.346
It's not something that we should keep from him.

37:25.116 --> 37:26.116
Why are you drinking?

37:26.955 --> 37:29.285
And you should have told me if you wanted to drink. Why...

37:29.386 --> 37:31.085
Do you want to ask why she's drinking with me?

37:32.725 --> 37:34.096
Is something going on, A Jin?

37:34.326 --> 37:36.995
- No, Ju Mi. - Just go to your room.

37:37.466 --> 37:38.966
The two of us have things to talk about.

37:44.066 --> 37:47.076
- Goodness. - Who's calling? Your wife?

37:48.535 --> 37:49.535
No, it's my dad.

37:50.076 --> 37:53.245
My old man makes me laugh. I mean, he used to be a total womanizer.

37:53.375 --> 37:56.076
How can he criticize me and hit me like that?

37:56.616 --> 37:59.616
Just pick up. We need your father on our side.

38:04.185 --> 38:05.555
You better come home right now!

38:06.685 --> 38:07.696
You crazy punk.

38:08.225 --> 38:10.926
Did I tell you to end it with that girl or not?

38:11.265 --> 38:12.696
Don't you know that your mom died young...

38:12.696 --> 38:14.096
because I philandered around...

38:14.265 --> 38:15.895
and broke her heart all her life?

38:15.966 --> 38:17.506
How can I not know that?

38:17.835 --> 38:19.665
Then how can you do that to your wife?

38:19.665 --> 38:21.335
I didn't learn any better.

38:21.335 --> 38:24.705
You deserve to be beaten up to a pulp. You're just so pathetic.

38:24.975 --> 38:28.475
What are you going to do if A Jin falls ill and dies young?

38:28.716 --> 38:30.386
Don't you worry, Dad.

38:30.915 --> 38:31.915
If that happens,

38:31.915 --> 38:34.085
I'll hire a caregiver and marry her like what you did.

38:34.085 --> 38:36.256
What? What did you just say?

38:36.716 --> 38:38.756
You've completely lost your mind.

38:39.585 --> 38:42.756
How dare you blabber away like that?

38:43.096 --> 38:47.596
I heard that A Jin was the one who introduced that cartoonist to you.

38:48.236 --> 38:50.236
How can you have an affair with that woman?

38:50.636 --> 38:51.805
Dad.

38:52.165 --> 38:53.676
She's not a cartoonist.

38:53.676 --> 38:55.705
How many times do I have to tell you that it's pop art?

38:55.705 --> 38:56.745
You know what?

38:57.145 --> 38:59.975
I at least found my women myself when I philandered around.

39:00.145 --> 39:01.475
I never got your mom involved.

39:01.975 --> 39:03.816
I made the effort myself.

39:04.116 --> 39:07.685
You're such a loser even in the way you cheat on your wife.

39:07.886 --> 39:09.555
You even need A Jin's help...

39:09.816 --> 39:11.826
to cheat on her.

39:12.055 --> 39:13.225
Dad.

39:13.225 --> 39:16.225
I'm confident that I can persuade you when I talk to you in person,

39:16.225 --> 39:19.066
so don't go overboard unless you want to embarrass yourself then.

39:19.066 --> 39:20.566
Why are you overreacting like this?

39:20.566 --> 39:21.566
Shut up, you punk.

39:22.296 --> 39:24.966
I'm going to give you exactly one week.

39:25.066 --> 39:26.875
If you continue seeing her after that,

39:26.875 --> 39:28.676
I'll kick you out of the company for good.

39:28.906 --> 39:29.906
You got that?

39:39.685 --> 39:41.685
What is his point?

39:42.055 --> 39:44.526
Is he saying I should philander through my own effort from now on?

39:44.785 --> 39:47.296
No one can talk nonsense like he does.

39:47.296 --> 39:48.326
What did he say?

39:48.326 --> 39:49.926
He obviously wants me to come home right away.

39:50.265 --> 39:51.265
Then you should go home now.

39:52.125 --> 39:54.136
- Why? - You need to obey your father.

39:54.596 --> 39:56.596
Can't you tell from what your stepmother did to me?

39:57.366 --> 39:59.535
Your father is furious right now.

39:59.535 --> 40:01.535
You might actually get kicked out of the company.

40:02.035 --> 40:03.406
If it happens, it happens.

40:04.276 --> 40:05.446
That's crazy.

40:05.576 --> 40:07.245
Have you lost your mind or what?

40:07.415 --> 40:09.776
Hey, I'm feeling a little disappointed in you right now.

40:10.316 --> 40:12.486
Had I been poor, would you not have loved me?

40:13.046 --> 40:14.785
Things like that don't even mean anything now.

40:15.055 --> 40:17.955
I like everything that makes who you are now.

40:18.455 --> 40:20.826
You asked me if I wouldn't have loved you had you been poor.

40:20.895 --> 40:22.725
My answer is neither yes nor no.

40:22.796 --> 40:23.826
Don't be so childish.

40:24.765 --> 40:27.096
So are you saying that I should go home right now?

40:27.395 --> 40:30.406
Don't make the situation worse. Try to be mature about things.

40:30.665 --> 40:32.835
You're not an adolescent.

40:32.835 --> 40:35.006
Hey. I wouldn't have gotten involved with you...

40:35.006 --> 40:36.375
if I had been a mature person.

40:43.785 --> 40:46.446
Do you know what my least favorite number is?

40:48.415 --> 40:51.455
Nine. It's nine.

40:52.355 --> 40:53.355
Do you know why?

40:56.625 --> 40:59.966
It's because I lost my dad when I was nine.

41:02.265 --> 41:04.265
My daughter, Ji Hu...

41:05.935 --> 41:07.975
I don't want her to hate...

41:09.305 --> 41:10.975
the number 11.

41:18.216 --> 41:19.886
Divorcing him...

41:20.455 --> 41:23.486
doesn't mean that Ji Hu will lose her dad.

41:24.855 --> 41:25.886
You're wrong.

41:27.026 --> 41:29.395
The sense of loss that she'll feel...

41:30.665 --> 41:35.035
won't be anything different from what I felt at the age of nine.

41:35.696 --> 41:36.866
Perhaps,

41:38.805 --> 41:40.805
she may end up with a deeper scar...

41:42.776 --> 41:45.776
because she'll feel betrayed on top of having to deal...

41:47.676 --> 41:49.176
with the sense of loss.

42:18.276 --> 42:20.616
I guess Dad does pity me after all.

42:20.915 --> 42:22.576
He gave me some money when he was kicking me out.

42:23.375 --> 42:24.886
Then are you planning...

42:25.046 --> 42:27.555
to stay here until Chairman Ahn decides...

42:27.785 --> 42:29.616
to give you a load of money?

42:29.616 --> 42:30.656
Of course.

42:31.085 --> 42:33.085
I'll be glued here like a piece of wet toilet paper...

42:33.156 --> 42:34.656
stuck on the bathroom floor.

42:35.225 --> 42:36.596
How much do you want?

42:36.895 --> 42:37.895
Two million dollars in cash.

42:38.566 --> 42:40.265
I'll move out if he gives me that much,

42:41.035 --> 42:43.705
but I'll still need to talk to him about my inheritance and shares.

42:45.406 --> 42:46.435
Oh, hey.

42:46.935 --> 42:49.975
Fill up the bathtub with hot water for me before you leave.

42:51.076 --> 42:52.446
Do it yourself.

42:54.446 --> 42:57.446
Gosh, seriously. Everyone thinks I'm a joke.

43:08.625 --> 43:09.796
Are you asleep?

43:39.225 --> 43:40.395
Look who's here.

43:43.395 --> 43:44.395
Everyone, come out!

43:45.395 --> 43:46.395
Come out!

43:47.395 --> 43:48.395
Where did everyone go?

43:53.875 --> 43:55.535
What brings you here?

44:01.875 --> 44:03.216
Go ahead and tell us why you're here.

44:03.515 --> 44:05.546
You were lurking around our house.

44:07.415 --> 44:08.756
I'm actually here...

44:09.886 --> 44:11.926
to apologize to you, Chairman Ahn.

44:13.185 --> 44:14.696
For what?

44:16.326 --> 44:20.165
The canopy that collapsed at your birthday party...

44:21.736 --> 44:23.236
I was there when that happened.

44:23.765 --> 44:24.765
You were?

44:25.265 --> 44:27.105
Why didn't you come and say hello to me?

44:28.605 --> 44:31.946
I was there to hurt Ms. Park Bok Ja, who is your wife now.

44:36.816 --> 44:39.816
I did what I was told to do because I got paid.

44:40.285 --> 44:43.116
What? What are you talking about now?

44:43.355 --> 44:45.526
Let's hear him out, honey.

44:47.055 --> 44:49.225
I have some debts to pay off.

44:50.265 --> 44:52.596
That's why I couldn't refuse such a crazy request.

44:53.566 --> 44:54.736
I'm sorry, sir.

44:56.265 --> 44:57.435
Goodness.

44:58.205 --> 45:00.035
I'm not following at all.

45:00.035 --> 45:01.406
One day, your eldest son's wife...

45:02.576 --> 45:03.906
I mean, this lady here...

45:05.546 --> 45:07.875
visited me at the gym and gave me an envelope with cash inside.

45:08.676 --> 45:09.846
What?

45:13.185 --> 45:14.515
Father, that is not true.

45:14.955 --> 45:15.955
Let's hear him out first.

45:16.116 --> 45:18.625
She said this person she hates is giving her murderous thoughts...

45:19.026 --> 45:20.395
and that she wants to sabotage her.

45:21.796 --> 45:23.296
"Sabotage"? What do you mean by that?

45:24.265 --> 45:25.265
Just enough...

45:26.366 --> 45:28.395
to make sure she can no longer work as a caregiver.

45:28.395 --> 45:30.236
What exactly did she tell you to do?

45:30.236 --> 45:31.305
Shut your mouth!

45:31.665 --> 45:33.366
I've never even met you.

45:33.935 --> 45:36.605
Father, he's framing me. I never did such a thing.

45:36.605 --> 45:38.975
- She told me to hurt her. - What?

45:39.046 --> 45:40.546
Oh my gosh.

45:40.616 --> 45:43.946
I've been feeling terribly guilty because I did it for money.

45:45.046 --> 45:46.216
I'm sorry.

45:48.116 --> 45:49.455
He's putting on a show, Father.

45:50.355 --> 45:52.725
I bet he's colluding with this woman.

45:53.085 --> 45:54.426
She's the mastermind behind it.

45:54.526 --> 45:57.366
Quiet down! How dare you spew such nonsense?

45:57.665 --> 45:59.165
Ju Mi.

45:59.196 --> 46:00.236
I get that you feel cornered,

46:00.335 --> 46:02.366
but you can't falsely accuse me like that.

46:03.096 --> 46:05.466
Honey. I'm okay,

46:06.035 --> 46:07.705
so let's not make a fuss about this.

46:08.136 --> 46:11.645
We should let him go. We can talk about it after he leaves.

46:13.645 --> 46:16.346
I can't believe you're doing this.

46:21.216 --> 46:22.816
It's not true, Father!

46:22.886 --> 46:23.926
Shut your mouth!

46:29.725 --> 46:30.765
A Jin.

46:31.196 --> 46:32.196
A Jin!

46:34.736 --> 46:37.066
- It's a total disaster over there. - What's happening now?

46:37.236 --> 46:39.605
Ju Mi, Jae Gu, and Un Gyu are about to get kicked out.

46:40.736 --> 46:42.736
By the way, do you really have to move?

46:42.736 --> 46:43.906
Why do you ask?

46:43.906 --> 46:45.906
Where will they go if they get kicked out?

46:45.906 --> 46:47.915
They should go stay at the place you bought at least.

46:47.915 --> 46:49.946
Jae Hui, I really can't let them stay there.

46:50.745 --> 46:52.085
Father, it's not true.

46:52.216 --> 46:54.585
I really didn't do it. Why would I do such a thing?

46:54.585 --> 46:57.285
The one whom you paid came forward because he felt too guilty.

46:57.486 --> 46:59.486
How dare you lie to my face? Get out!

47:00.196 --> 47:02.026
- We'll move out. - Are you out of your mind?

47:02.156 --> 47:04.696
Do you even know what I put up with in this house while you were gone?

47:04.796 --> 47:05.826
Think about Un Gyu.

47:08.495 --> 47:12.205
Father, Un Gyu is a senior now.

47:12.566 --> 47:14.406
You're fond of him.

47:14.906 --> 47:16.406
Please think about him and...

47:16.535 --> 47:19.375
Then, I'll wait until Un Gyu graduates...

47:20.076 --> 47:23.076
No, I'll let you guys stay just until his college entrance exam.

47:24.486 --> 47:26.986
I want you guys gone after that. I can't stand any of you.

47:36.225 --> 47:37.395
Your father...

47:38.196 --> 47:40.196
gave your brother really difficult time for having an affair...

47:41.395 --> 47:43.835
because he didn't want A Jin to be heartbroken.

47:47.875 --> 47:50.305
But he's kicking me out without even giving me a chance to explain.

47:53.176 --> 47:54.176
I can't believe this.

47:56.576 --> 47:59.085
This is all your fault. Do you realize that?

48:26.846 --> 48:29.346
- I have the sales report here. - All right.

48:34.685 --> 48:37.355
Mr. Ahn. Where are you going? I should be leaving.

48:37.625 --> 48:38.955
Oh, you're right.

48:40.296 --> 48:42.125
Sit. Let's talk.

48:46.696 --> 48:48.196
What brings you here?

48:48.435 --> 48:50.466
I was just at UN Top Village.

48:51.665 --> 48:53.835
- Why did you go there? - I want to move.

48:54.305 --> 48:55.975
Why do you want to move all of a sudden?

48:55.975 --> 48:57.006
"All of a sudden"?

48:57.276 --> 48:59.105
I'd move out of this country if I could.

48:59.506 --> 49:02.546
I can't go on like this for Ji Hu's sake.

49:03.716 --> 49:08.216
I wanted to move there and get a fresh start,

49:08.216 --> 49:09.256
but...

49:10.685 --> 49:12.055
the passcode has been changed.

49:14.756 --> 49:15.926
I rented it out.

49:16.656 --> 49:17.665
What?

49:17.665 --> 49:20.495
I didn't know that you wanted to move.

49:20.495 --> 49:22.196
How can you rent it out without even asking me?

49:22.335 --> 49:23.506
Have you lost your mind?

49:28.305 --> 49:29.335
What is it?

49:30.946 --> 49:31.946
Tell me the truth.

49:32.676 --> 49:33.676
What did you do?

49:37.046 --> 49:39.046
- I'll kill you! - No, A Jin!

49:39.216 --> 49:41.886
- Gosh, A Jin. Stop! - Die.

49:41.955 --> 49:43.785
Don't kill me. Hey! Don't. A Jin, please.

49:43.886 --> 49:45.055
- How could you... - A Jin!

49:45.426 --> 49:47.926
Come again? Who are you going to live with at that house?

49:48.026 --> 49:49.055
How could you?

49:49.355 --> 49:51.366
A Jin, please don't kill me.

49:52.066 --> 49:53.765
A Jin! Gosh.

50:00.176 --> 50:02.506
Ms. Woo, I have nothing to do with this.

50:02.835 --> 50:05.875
I don't even know why I'm running away right now!

50:06.276 --> 50:08.446
Please believe me!

50:36.406 --> 50:38.576
Why do you look so distraught?

50:41.645 --> 50:42.975
Where's Mr. Kang?

50:43.176 --> 50:44.185
He's at the court now.

50:48.355 --> 50:50.185
I'm here for a consultation.

50:52.855 --> 50:54.895
To change the ownership of a real estate property...

50:55.096 --> 50:57.265
under my husband's name...

50:58.196 --> 50:59.526
Well, I mean...

51:02.196 --> 51:05.035
Right now,

51:06.305 --> 51:08.805
my husband is living there with another woman...

51:13.415 --> 51:16.245
He's currently living there with another woman.

51:18.316 --> 51:19.816
If I want to change the ownership...

51:21.986 --> 51:23.015
I mean,

51:25.826 --> 51:26.855
we bought that house...

51:29.026 --> 51:30.196
for our daughter...

51:31.426 --> 51:32.926
and the two of us...

51:44.105 --> 51:45.605
Please calm down.

51:51.886 --> 51:52.886
I'm sorry.

51:54.886 --> 51:58.886
I came here to get some advice because I was so frustrated.

52:02.096 --> 52:03.466
I'll come back another time.

52:22.316 --> 52:23.346
Going up.

52:44.966 --> 52:46.006
A Jin.

52:46.165 --> 52:47.335
A Jin!

52:48.475 --> 52:49.506
A Jin.

53:12.566 --> 53:14.035
Don't get up.

53:14.395 --> 53:15.495
I'm okay.

53:15.566 --> 53:17.736
That's not for you to decide.

53:18.205 --> 53:20.776
The doctor wants you to move to the ward to run a few tests.

53:21.305 --> 53:22.475
You also need to get some rest.

53:22.736 --> 53:24.745
It's all right. I'm just going to go home.

53:24.805 --> 53:25.975
You can come to a hospital anytime,

53:25.975 --> 53:29.446
but you can't leave whenever you want once you're admitted.

53:30.015 --> 53:31.185
I have to go.

53:31.645 --> 53:33.515
Hey, partner. You need to follow the doctor's orders.

53:40.855 --> 53:44.366
I guess I looked too dashing.

53:45.196 --> 53:46.526
That's probably why you fainted.

53:47.835 --> 53:48.866
I'm sorry.

53:49.535 --> 53:52.035
I'm sorry for looking too dashing and making you faint.

53:52.665 --> 53:54.006
You have nothing to apologize for.

53:59.105 --> 54:01.116
Well, I need to call my family.

54:01.875 --> 54:02.875
Okay, A Jin.

54:03.216 --> 54:05.546
Don't worry about Ji Hu. I'll look after her.

54:07.316 --> 54:08.816
What's wrong? What did she say?

54:10.055 --> 54:12.555
A Jin is not feeling well. She's at a hospital now.

54:13.225 --> 54:14.256
What?

54:14.796 --> 54:17.495
Does that mean she won't come home today? What does she have?

54:17.995 --> 54:20.835
What do you think? She's heartbroken.

54:20.835 --> 54:22.535
What on earth is happening?

54:23.506 --> 54:25.866
Jin Hee, I'm done with my homework.

54:26.435 --> 54:28.935
Ji Hu, you should go to bed early today.

54:28.935 --> 54:32.406
Ji Hu, do you happen to know if your mom and dad...

54:32.406 --> 54:34.076
are having problems these days?

54:34.176 --> 54:35.346
Why do you ask?

54:35.576 --> 54:37.915
I'm just wondering if you've heard anything.

54:37.915 --> 54:38.946
No, I haven't.

54:39.046 --> 54:41.285
For example, anything about your dad cheating on your mom or...

54:41.355 --> 54:42.816
What are you doing right now?

54:43.185 --> 54:45.225
I just don't understand what's going on.

54:45.526 --> 54:47.725
A Jin called and said that she's at a hospital out of the blue.

54:49.656 --> 54:51.665
Mom is at a hospital now?

54:52.026 --> 54:53.366
- No... - Yes.

55:02.576 --> 55:05.276
What did I tell you? I told you to just hire someone.

55:05.846 --> 55:07.475
Why did you move them by yourself?

55:07.475 --> 55:08.515
That's why you're bedridden like this now.

55:09.245 --> 55:11.245
It's not because I moved my stuff alone.

55:11.745 --> 55:13.415
My body is just starting to ache...

55:13.415 --> 55:14.785
from getting assaulted by your stepmother.

55:17.285 --> 55:18.986
Gosh, pick up already.

55:19.355 --> 55:20.995
Okay. It must be my dad.

55:22.455 --> 55:24.096
Oh, gosh. It's Ji Hu.

55:24.395 --> 55:25.765
(My beautiful daughter)

55:33.705 --> 55:34.705
Did you talk to your family?

55:35.105 --> 55:36.176
Yes.

55:39.906 --> 55:41.946
Is this your first time getting hospitalized?

55:42.676 --> 55:44.716
No, it's not.

55:47.386 --> 55:50.555
I got married when I was 25.

55:50.855 --> 55:52.225
My wife and I got into a car accident...

55:52.225 --> 55:53.555
on the way to our honeymoon.

55:54.796 --> 55:56.625
After losing my wife like that,

55:57.395 --> 56:00.765
I spent two years at a hospital in a coma.

56:01.265 --> 56:02.765
People call it "vegetative state."

56:03.805 --> 56:06.835
That's the state I was in throughout the time I was hospitalized.

56:08.305 --> 56:10.645
I lost those two years of my life.

56:11.946 --> 56:14.776
Those years just vanished from my life.

56:16.846 --> 56:18.015
But you know what?

56:19.116 --> 56:20.156
I do remember something.

56:21.486 --> 56:23.826
Even though I was unconscious,

56:24.355 --> 56:25.855
there was a thought...

56:26.955 --> 56:28.995
my unconscious self was holding onto.

56:30.326 --> 56:31.366
I remember it.

56:33.935 --> 56:35.636
I thought, "I must live."

56:37.906 --> 56:39.736
"For the sake of my wife,"

56:40.875 --> 56:42.375
"I must survive this."

56:43.335 --> 56:45.375
I had no idea that she had already passed away.

56:49.375 --> 56:52.386
The earnest determination to survive in order to keep someone safe...

56:53.616 --> 56:55.285
brought me back to life.

56:57.886 --> 56:58.926
You should also...

56:59.585 --> 57:03.296
think about those whom you need to protect.

57:07.835 --> 57:08.866
Give me your hand.

57:16.435 --> 57:19.446
It'll turn into a real crane and fly away.

57:31.785 --> 57:32.785
I have to step out for a minute.

57:33.326 --> 57:35.326
They want me to sign the admission consent form.

58:06.955 --> 58:08.326
There's only one left now.

58:08.826 --> 58:10.326
What will you do about the younger son's wife?

58:18.866 --> 58:20.535
(Husband)

58:25.946 --> 58:26.946
Hello?

58:26.946 --> 58:28.116
I heard that you're at a hospital now.

58:28.875 --> 58:29.875
What happened?

58:30.515 --> 58:31.546
Where are you now?

58:32.085 --> 58:33.085
What do you think? I'm home.

58:33.555 --> 58:34.585
Which one?

58:34.716 --> 58:35.756
Do you have to ask?

58:36.316 --> 58:37.355
The other one, obviously.

58:38.926 --> 58:41.256
Did you faint because of what I said earlier?

58:41.995 --> 58:43.796
- What? - A Jin.

58:44.366 --> 58:46.596
You can't faint like that.

58:47.066 --> 58:48.995
Ji Hu is crying her eyes out because of you right now.

58:49.765 --> 58:51.335
Why did you have to make her worry like that?

58:53.136 --> 58:54.475
A Jin, I...

58:57.475 --> 58:59.145
I love you.

58:59.875 --> 59:01.875
It's just that you're not the only woman I love.

59:02.145 --> 59:04.486
I guess you can say that it's a problem, but...

59:05.486 --> 59:07.816
Anyway, I don't want a divorce.

59:08.585 --> 59:09.915
Try to be cool about it, okay?

59:10.185 --> 59:12.225
Just accept it.

59:20.995 --> 59:22.835
Don't leave Ji Hu alone.

59:23.665 --> 59:24.835
You should go home.

59:24.835 --> 59:25.866
Jae Hui is there.

59:27.305 --> 59:29.305
Don't be like this, please.

59:29.935 --> 59:31.305
Go home to Ji Hu.

59:32.076 --> 59:33.105
Do it for me, please.

59:33.105 --> 59:34.776
Seong Hui is not feeling well.

59:42.355 --> 59:44.026
Hello? Hey...

59:45.886 --> 59:48.395
She hangs up on me like this from time to time.

59:48.696 --> 59:50.696
It's a bad habit.

59:55.435 --> 59:56.805
(My dear daughter)

59:57.605 --> 01:00:00.435
Mom, I love you so much. Cheer up!

01:00:00.835 --> 01:00:02.006
Don't be sick.

01:00:09.816 --> 01:00:10.846
Ahn Jae Seok.

01:00:13.185 --> 01:00:16.116
You're out of my life for good now.

01:00:17.285 --> 01:00:19.026
What will you do about the other one?

01:00:21.225 --> 01:00:22.395
I won't...

01:00:24.995 --> 01:00:25.995
touch her.

01:00:48.986 --> 01:00:51.225
(The Lady in Dignity)

01:00:51.585 --> 01:00:52.656
Let's get divorced.

01:00:52.656 --> 01:00:55.156
My wife wants to file for divorce.

01:00:55.326 --> 01:00:56.895
Thank you for your help in advance.

01:00:56.895 --> 01:00:58.466
No problem. I'll do my best.

01:00:58.596 --> 01:01:00.765
Is my sunshine really leaving me like this?

01:01:02.165 --> 01:01:05.335
Please continue to update me on everything Chairman Ahn does.

01:01:05.605 --> 01:01:06.605
Of course, madam.

01:01:07.035 --> 01:01:09.375
Stop it. Why are you doing this? We've never met before.

01:01:09.975 --> 01:01:12.676
Are you going to do as I ask?

01:01:12.875 --> 01:01:15.176
The house you two are living in now is mine.

01:01:15.245 --> 01:01:16.515
Ji Hu and I have to move in there,

01:01:16.515 --> 01:01:17.846
so you two must move out immediately.

01:01:17.846 --> 01:01:19.185
Let's put it under my name.

01:01:19.245 --> 01:01:22.585
Only then, your wife won't be able to say that she'll move in here.

01:01:23.185 --> 01:01:26.225
You can't back down. We're on the edge of a cliff right now.

01:01:26.326 --> 01:01:29.296
At least kill that woman before you go.

01:01:30.495 --> 01:01:32.625
"Vice-chairwoman". My foot.

01:01:33.125 --> 01:01:35.296
- Jae Gu, don't. - Mark my words.

01:01:35.495 --> 01:01:37.335
I'll kill this one today and go to jail.

01:01:37.335 --> 01:01:39.366
Kill me!

01:01:40.136 --> 01:01:42.835
Are you scared that I might do something else to you?

01:01:45.975 --> 01:01:47.015
(Vice-chairwoman Park Ji Yeong)

01:01:47.716 --> 01:01:50.616
I need to finish what I started. That's all.
