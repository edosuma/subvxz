WEBVTT

00:03.910 --> 00:06.110
But I thought you tell us
your husband was an accounted.

00:06.264 --> 00:08.084
He was.
But...

00:08.356 --> 00:10.056
After he died,
I've discovered

00:10.127 --> 00:12.227
he was also a fensfull mob.

00:12.697 --> 00:14.097
You know what?

00:14.389 --> 00:15.955
I don't need the wine.
I'm ready to go now.

00:16.090 --> 00:18.591
- As am I.

00:18.626 --> 00:19.892
- Oh, go ahead.

00:19.927 --> 00:21.527
I don't need sex
with you.

00:21.562 --> 00:23.696
I have my son.

00:23.731 --> 00:26.332
The storm knocked out all
of the reception.

00:26.367 --> 00:27.467
Now I'm dying
to tell him

00:27.501 --> 00:28.801
how much I want
to meet him,

00:28.836 --> 00:30.536
and he's someplace thinking
I don't care.

00:32.372 --> 00:33.673
- I love you!
Oh.

00:33.707 --> 00:35.141
- Actress in a daytime drama

00:35.175 --> 00:36.876
goes to...

00:36.910 --> 00:38.044
Victoria chase
for <i>edge of tomorrow.</i>

00:38.078 --> 00:39.312
- Oh!
Oh, my God!

00:39.346 --> 00:40.713
- What the hell
is all this stuff?

00:40.748 --> 00:43.616
- You had to date
a cop, didn't you?

01:20.254 --> 01:22.255
Pipe down.

01:27.628 --> 01:29.162
- What's with the big m?

01:29.196 --> 01:31.130
- Stands for murder.

01:31.165 --> 01:33.499
- Is that what you're
in for?

01:33.534 --> 01:34.767
- No.

01:34.802 --> 01:36.736
It's what I've been
thinking about

01:36.770 --> 01:40.273
ever since you started
playing that harmonica.

01:44.078 --> 01:46.145
- So what are you
in for, kid?

01:46.180 --> 01:48.648
- Drunk and disorderly.

01:48.682 --> 01:51.751
Or, as I like to call it,

01:51.785 --> 01:54.354
Tuesday.

01:56.357 --> 01:58.524
And how 'bout you?

01:58.559 --> 02:01.294
- Possession of stolen goods.

02:01.328 --> 02:03.463
My husband was in the mob.

02:03.497 --> 02:04.464
- Really.

02:04.498 --> 02:06.299
Mine, too.

02:06.333 --> 02:07.500
Which family?

02:07.534 --> 02:09.001
- Palomara.

02:09.036 --> 02:11.404
- Me too.

02:11.438 --> 02:13.773
I thought you looked
familiar.

02:13.807 --> 02:16.309
You're the one who brought
the ambrosia

02:16.343 --> 02:18.044
to big Pauly's
going-away party,

02:18.078 --> 02:19.145
aren't you?

02:19.179 --> 02:22.048
- You brought the gabagool.

02:22.082 --> 02:23.149
- Yes.

02:23.183 --> 02:24.917
And you were the one
that got picked up

02:24.952 --> 02:28.421
with all the stuff.

02:28.455 --> 02:30.022
Tell me,

02:30.057 --> 02:33.826
wasn't there a Faberge egg
in the stuff?

02:33.861 --> 02:35.128
- Yes.
- Mm-Hmm.

02:35.162 --> 02:38.164
I sold it to open
the Faberge animal shelter.

02:38.198 --> 02:39.665
- Mm-Hmm.

02:39.700 --> 02:41.100
- Looking back,
not the best name

02:41.135 --> 02:42.368
to keep the heat off.

02:42.403 --> 02:43.836
- No.

02:43.871 --> 02:45.071
- That took spunk.

02:45.105 --> 02:46.739
- Thank you.

02:46.774 --> 02:49.142
- I hate spunk.

03:00.421 --> 03:03.489
- So let's not wait
another 33 years

03:03.524 --> 03:05.258
to do this again,
okay, stretch?

03:05.292 --> 03:07.727
- You got it.

03:07.761 --> 03:08.861
- Oh, hi.

03:08.896 --> 03:09.862
- Hi.

03:09.897 --> 03:11.397
Oh, you're right.

03:11.432 --> 03:13.466
They do look like hookers.

03:19.106 --> 03:21.707
- All right, you ladies
have five minutes.

03:21.742 --> 03:23.810
- Oh, Elka,
you poor thing.

03:23.844 --> 03:25.244
- Did you get the money?

03:25.279 --> 03:26.679
- Well, no, not yet.

03:26.713 --> 03:28.181
Your bail is very high.

03:28.215 --> 03:30.149
- Did you have to insult
the judge like that?

03:30.184 --> 03:33.419
- He called me elderly.

03:33.454 --> 03:36.122
- Well, you are elderly.

03:36.156 --> 03:40.092
- And he was really fat.

03:42.362 --> 03:46.232
But it's all your stupid
cop boyfriend's fault.

03:46.266 --> 03:48.201
- I know,
and Pete's being punished.

03:48.235 --> 03:49.836
I am not talking to him.

03:49.870 --> 03:53.072
- That's not how
you punish a man.

03:53.106 --> 03:55.975
You talk more.

03:56.009 --> 03:59.645
- We're trying to raise
your bail.

03:59.680 --> 04:00.913
But my money
is all tied up

04:00.948 --> 04:02.181
in my house
that won't sell.

04:02.216 --> 04:03.716
- And mine's
in my business,

04:03.750 --> 04:05.017
which is not doing
so hot.

04:05.052 --> 04:06.385
Apparently,
in this economy,

04:06.420 --> 04:10.156
$200 eyebrow shapings
are the first thing to go.

04:10.190 --> 04:12.859
- People are plucking
their own brows?

04:12.893 --> 04:16.295
Do we live in a third world
country now?

04:16.329 --> 04:17.529
- Victoria.

04:17.564 --> 04:19.798
You're loaded.

04:19.833 --> 04:21.367
I mean,
you spend thousands

04:21.401 --> 04:24.470
on that wrinkle stuff
made from whale urine.

04:24.505 --> 04:26.973
- When it's used
for medicinal purposes,

04:27.007 --> 04:29.942
it's pronounced, "your-eine."

04:29.977 --> 04:32.011
Oh, and I haven't been able
to reach my money people

04:32.045 --> 04:33.446
since the tornado.

04:33.480 --> 04:35.147
Oh, I've got bars.

04:35.182 --> 04:36.382
No offense.

04:36.416 --> 04:39.619
And I have a message
from my business manager.

04:39.653 --> 04:41.220
He's probably calling
to congratulate me

04:41.255 --> 04:42.388
on my emmy.

04:42.422 --> 04:45.291
Oh, what a magical night.

04:45.325 --> 04:47.627
I've been walking on air
ever since.

04:47.661 --> 04:50.730
- Oh, haven't we all.

04:50.764 --> 04:52.298
- Oh, my God.

04:52.332 --> 04:54.767
Oh, my God.

04:54.801 --> 04:55.835
Oh, my God.

04:55.869 --> 04:57.670
- What?
What is it?

04:57.704 --> 04:59.405
- My business manager
has been indicted

04:59.439 --> 05:00.940
on tax fraud.

05:00.974 --> 05:02.842
All of my assets are frozen.

05:02.876 --> 05:05.678
I've been madoffed!

05:05.712 --> 05:07.513
- That's terrible.
- Honey, I'm so sorry.

05:07.548 --> 05:08.915
- Oh, this is unfathomable.

05:08.949 --> 05:10.216
I am Victoria chase.

05:10.250 --> 05:12.285
I am rich and famous.

05:12.319 --> 05:14.086
Now half of my identity
is gone.

05:14.121 --> 05:16.188
There's no rich.
There's no and.

05:16.223 --> 05:18.858
I'm only famous.

05:18.892 --> 05:23.229
- You're not even
that famous.

05:23.263 --> 05:25.331
- Victoria, calm down.

05:25.365 --> 05:26.332
You're a strong woman.

05:26.366 --> 05:27.500
You can get through this.

05:27.534 --> 05:29.402
- Maybe you're right.

05:29.436 --> 05:31.137
I mean, after all,
I did play a homeless woman

05:31.171 --> 05:34.574
in the lifetime original movie
<i>concrete pillow,</i>

05:34.608 --> 05:36.208
based on the novel
<i>the sidewalk is my bed,</i>

05:36.243 --> 05:38.244
by shazique.

05:40.280 --> 05:42.515
Oh, who am I kidding?

05:42.549 --> 05:44.617
I can't be poor.

05:44.651 --> 05:46.919
I'm flying private
to Chicago on Thursday

05:46.954 --> 05:48.220
for Botox.

05:48.255 --> 05:51.691
What a day to forget
my chill pills.

05:51.725 --> 05:55.261
- Oh, you gotta front up
and bug down, bitch.

05:58.065 --> 06:00.399
It's prison slang.

06:03.236 --> 06:05.972
- You've been here
three hours.

06:06.006 --> 06:08.674
- The joint changes you.

06:08.709 --> 06:10.509
I also know
how to kill somebody

06:10.544 --> 06:14.714
with a toothbrush.

06:14.748 --> 06:15.848
- Okay, listen.

06:15.882 --> 06:17.016
There are a ton of things
we could do

06:17.050 --> 06:18.017
to raise money, okay?

06:18.051 --> 06:19.652
We could have a benefit,

06:19.686 --> 06:21.854
or we could have
an estate sale.

06:21.888 --> 06:25.057
- In Cleveland,
they're called garage sales.

06:25.092 --> 06:27.593
- Ew.

06:27.628 --> 06:28.794
- Well, do it.

06:28.829 --> 06:29.829
You girls have
to figure out

06:29.863 --> 06:31.530
some way to get money.

06:31.565 --> 06:33.833
- Oh, bless you, Elka.

06:33.867 --> 06:36.235
To think of me
in this time of need.

06:36.269 --> 06:39.438
- For me, you idiot.

06:39.473 --> 06:41.974
I'm in frickin' jail.

06:47.648 --> 06:50.116
- I carried this evening purse
on the red carpet

06:50.150 --> 06:52.685
at the 2008
people's choice awards.

06:52.719 --> 06:54.954
- Didn't Susan Lucci
win that year?

06:56.923 --> 06:58.791
- That's irrelevant
to the story.

06:58.825 --> 07:00.192
- I'll give you a buck fifty.

07:00.227 --> 07:02.795
- This retailed for $4,000.

07:02.829 --> 07:04.230
- But it's so small.

07:04.264 --> 07:05.798
- No, that's what makes it
so chic.

07:05.832 --> 07:09.101
It screams, "I have people
to carry my things."

07:09.136 --> 07:11.771
- But what if you
don't have people?

07:11.805 --> 07:12.972
- I don't know.

07:13.006 --> 07:14.774
I-I mean,
I really don't know.

07:14.808 --> 07:17.843
- I would really like
to buy something

07:17.878 --> 07:18.944
to help Elka.

07:18.979 --> 07:21.313
I mean...

07:21.348 --> 07:23.215
Don't you have anything larger
than a size 4?

07:23.250 --> 07:26.452
- I certainly hope not.

07:27.487 --> 07:30.456
- Oh, I'll get it.

07:32.592 --> 07:33.826
- Hello, Melanie.

07:33.860 --> 07:34.994
- Hi, Rick.

07:35.028 --> 07:36.462
Boy, I haven't seen
you since--

07:36.496 --> 07:39.799
- since you saw
all of me?

07:39.833 --> 07:41.801
- Yeah, you know what?
That's all been forgotten.

07:41.835 --> 07:42.802
- Really?

07:42.836 --> 07:44.470
Me completely disrobing

07:44.504 --> 07:45.471
because I mistakenly
believed

07:45.505 --> 07:46.906
that you were attracted
to me?

07:46.940 --> 07:48.908
That's totally
out of your head?

07:48.942 --> 07:52.678
- Well, it's back now.

07:52.713 --> 07:55.347
- Well, actually,
I'm here to see Joy.

07:55.382 --> 07:58.084
For some reason,
our hemp-loving mailman

07:58.118 --> 08:00.686
delivered this letter
to my home by mistake.

08:00.721 --> 08:02.121
Excuse me, Joy.

08:02.155 --> 08:03.622
I opened this
before I saw

08:03.657 --> 08:04.790
who it was addressed to.

08:04.825 --> 08:06.759
- Oh.

08:06.793 --> 08:07.927
It's from the I.N.S.

08:07.961 --> 08:09.095
- Mm-Hmm.

08:09.129 --> 08:12.765
You, my dear,
are in need of a green card.

08:12.799 --> 08:13.766
Joy.

08:13.800 --> 08:15.434
My darling.

08:15.469 --> 08:18.604
My English muffin.

08:18.638 --> 08:20.339
Would you marry me?

08:26.107 --> 08:27.841
- Marry you?
What are you talking about?

08:27.876 --> 08:29.009
- Well, it's not
that complicated.

08:29.043 --> 08:30.344
I mean,
we're all familiar

08:30.378 --> 08:32.780
with movies like
<i>the proposal</i> and <i>green card.</i>

08:32.813 --> 08:34.648
I'll be your Ryan Reynolds.

08:34.682 --> 08:38.051
Your Gerard Depardieu.

08:38.086 --> 08:39.886
- Absolutely not.

08:39.921 --> 08:41.221
- Well, don't misunderstand.

08:41.256 --> 08:43.524
I mean, the whole marriage
would be a complete sham.

08:43.558 --> 08:45.225
I would expect nothing
in return.

08:45.260 --> 08:46.827
- Then why would you do it?

08:46.861 --> 08:48.695
- Let me demonstrate.

08:48.730 --> 08:49.963
E-excuse me.

08:49.998 --> 08:50.998
Miss?

08:51.032 --> 08:52.399
- Yes?
- Hi.

08:52.434 --> 08:54.935
I'm Rick, and--
and this is Joy,

08:54.969 --> 08:57.971
my fiancee.

08:58.006 --> 09:00.441
I notice your expression
just changed.

09:00.475 --> 09:02.576
You were surprised
to hear

09:02.610 --> 09:03.577
that we were a couple.

09:03.611 --> 09:05.746
- Well, yes,
I guess I was.

09:05.780 --> 09:07.881
- I don't want to put words
into your mouth.

09:07.916 --> 09:09.650
But several explanations
may have popped

09:09.684 --> 09:11.552
into your head.

09:11.586 --> 09:13.687
He must have money.

09:13.721 --> 09:16.190
Or he's extraordinarily
gifted in bed.

09:16.224 --> 09:18.759
Or he's so incredibly
wonderful

09:18.793 --> 09:21.428
that she was able
to overlook

09:21.463 --> 09:24.198
his nonconformist
body type.

09:24.232 --> 09:26.600
Did any of these thoughts
occur to you?

09:26.634 --> 09:29.036
Please be honest.

09:29.070 --> 09:31.872
- Yes, all three of them.

09:31.906 --> 09:35.008
- Very good.
You've been most helpful.

09:35.043 --> 09:38.178
We are so gonna get me laid.

09:38.213 --> 09:40.013
- Look, Rick, dear.

09:40.048 --> 09:41.482
I appreciate
the offer, really,

09:41.516 --> 09:43.016
but I've had letters
like this before,

09:43.051 --> 09:45.085
and I've always been able
to work it out.

09:45.119 --> 09:47.287
I don't need
a fake marriage.

09:47.322 --> 09:49.122
- Would you do it
just for me, then?

09:49.157 --> 09:50.390
- Hell no.

09:50.425 --> 09:52.259
- Y-your mouth is saying,
"hell no,"

09:52.293 --> 09:56.230
but your eyes
are just saying merely, "no."

09:56.264 --> 09:58.866
Now they're saying,
"hell no."

09:58.900 --> 09:59.867
Hm.

09:59.901 --> 10:02.035
So what is all this?

10:02.070 --> 10:04.404
- Oh, we're trying
to raise Elka's bail money.

10:04.439 --> 10:06.440
Unfortunately,
nothing's selling.

10:06.474 --> 10:07.708
- Of course not.

10:07.742 --> 10:10.878
These L.A. fripperies
have no value here.

10:10.912 --> 10:13.814
You have to offer people
something they want.

10:13.848 --> 10:17.117
Like my balls.

10:20.722 --> 10:21.889
- Excuse me?

10:21.923 --> 10:23.857
- I'm a collector
of sports memorabilia.

10:23.892 --> 10:26.026
Clevelanders love
their teams.

10:26.060 --> 10:27.227
People would pay
any amount of money

10:27.262 --> 10:28.228
for the right item.

10:28.263 --> 10:30.264
- Really?
- Oh, yes.

10:30.298 --> 10:31.999
Collectors have been drooling
over my balls

10:32.033 --> 10:34.001
for years.

10:34.035 --> 10:36.537
- Can't you just say
baseballs?

10:36.571 --> 10:38.605
- I also collect
basketballs and footballs,

10:38.640 --> 10:41.942
so no.

10:43.511 --> 10:45.412
- Melanie, come on.
Please let me in.

10:45.446 --> 10:46.747
- I'm not speaking
to you, Pete.

10:46.781 --> 10:48.081
Go away.

10:48.116 --> 10:49.116
- Will you at least
open the door?

10:49.150 --> 10:50.751
- All right.

10:50.785 --> 10:53.587
But it's not gonna change
one little thing.

10:53.621 --> 10:55.689
Oh.

10:55.723 --> 10:57.624
Hello.
- Good afternoon, ma'am.

10:57.659 --> 10:59.393
I'm officer-in-training
Jack Appel.

10:59.427 --> 11:00.727
- I'm Melanie Moretti.

11:00.762 --> 11:02.095
It's very nice
to meet you.

11:02.130 --> 11:04.932
I-I must have seemed awful
just now.

11:04.966 --> 11:06.934
Normally, I'm much friendlier.
I really am.

11:06.968 --> 11:08.368
People actually comment
on it.

11:08.403 --> 11:09.703
I would ask him
to vouch for me,

11:09.737 --> 11:11.371
but I'm not speaking
to him

11:11.406 --> 11:12.839
because he put somebody
that I care about in jail.

11:12.874 --> 11:14.107
- When an officer
of the law

11:14.142 --> 11:15.509
sees a crime
being committed,

11:15.543 --> 11:17.144
it's his sworn duty
to make the arrest, ma'am.

11:17.178 --> 11:18.745
- See?

11:18.780 --> 11:20.881
- Well, now I'm not speaking
to you, either.

11:20.915 --> 11:22.482
- I'm sorry, ma'am.

11:22.517 --> 11:24.551
- And don't call
a woman "ma'am".

11:24.586 --> 11:25.619
We hate it.

11:25.653 --> 11:28.789
Call us "miss"
until the day we die.

11:28.823 --> 11:31.558
- Hey, guess who just sold
Victoria's chill pills

11:31.593 --> 11:33.594
to the stoner mailman?

11:43.137 --> 11:46.139
- Well, we know who the bitch
is gonna be.

11:53.028 --> 11:54.128
- You're being deported?

11:54.163 --> 11:56.197
- My immigration status
was already in question,

11:56.232 --> 11:57.899
and now,
thanks to this arrest,

11:57.933 --> 11:59.234
they're gonna ship me
back to England.

11:59.268 --> 12:01.936
I need to clear my head.

12:01.971 --> 12:03.404
I need a plan.

12:03.439 --> 12:04.772
Oh, who am I kidding?

12:04.807 --> 12:05.940
I need a drink.

12:05.975 --> 12:09.310
Take out that loose cinder block
over there.

12:09.345 --> 12:11.779
You'll find a baggie
of raisin wine.

12:11.814 --> 12:14.082
- Seriously?

12:19.121 --> 12:21.956
"Chateau neuf d'Elka."

12:21.991 --> 12:23.958
- It's a good vintage.

12:23.993 --> 12:28.162
2:00.

12:28.197 --> 12:29.631
- You know...

12:29.665 --> 12:33.468
This isn't my first time
behind bars.

12:33.502 --> 12:34.802
I was a bit
of a wild child

12:34.837 --> 12:37.038
in my teen years.

12:37.072 --> 12:38.139
Um, I'm not proud
of it now,

12:38.173 --> 12:41.776
but I did my share
of shoplifting.

12:41.810 --> 12:43.745
Anyway...

12:43.779 --> 12:46.080
My rebellious phase
was brief.

12:46.115 --> 12:48.483
Getting pregnant and giving
my son up for adoption

12:48.517 --> 12:50.118
really sobered me up.

12:50.152 --> 12:53.388
- Have you heard
from him yet?

12:53.422 --> 12:54.656
- I haven't told
anyone yet,

12:54.690 --> 12:56.257
but he sent me an email

12:56.292 --> 12:58.059
saying he has cold feet

12:58.093 --> 12:59.060
and wants to take
some more time

12:59.094 --> 13:00.261
before meeting me.

13:00.296 --> 13:01.963
- Oh, I'm sorry.

13:01.997 --> 13:04.265
- Me, too.

13:04.300 --> 13:06.467
Ugh, this whole thing
has got me thinking

13:06.502 --> 13:08.469
about time passing.

13:08.504 --> 13:11.973
Mistakes I've made,
regrets.

13:12.007 --> 13:13.441
Getting older.

13:13.475 --> 13:18.012
- Oh, you're a barrel
of laughs.

13:18.047 --> 13:21.182
You shouldn't worry so much
about getting old.

13:21.216 --> 13:24.719
There's a secret
that nobody tells you.

13:24.753 --> 13:26.821
You don't feel old.

13:26.855 --> 13:28.356
You feel like yourself.

13:28.390 --> 13:29.590
- Really?

13:29.625 --> 13:30.792
- Well, obviously,

13:30.826 --> 13:32.427
the--the woman looking
back at me

13:32.461 --> 13:36.064
from my mirror
isn't young.

13:36.098 --> 13:38.599
She bugs me sometimes.

13:38.634 --> 13:40.635
- I know.
It's weird, isn't it?

13:40.669 --> 13:42.837
I look at pictures
of myself in my 20s

13:42.871 --> 13:44.572
when I obsessed
over every little flaw,

13:44.606 --> 13:46.274
and I just want
to shake the girl

13:46.308 --> 13:48.443
and tell her to relax
and enjoy it.

13:48.477 --> 13:50.878
- I look at pictures
of me in my 70s,

13:50.913 --> 13:53.581
and I think that.

13:53.615 --> 13:54.849
- Well, that gives me hope.

13:54.883 --> 13:55.850
- It shouldn't.

13:55.884 --> 13:59.420
I started out
prettier than you.

14:01.924 --> 14:03.691
- When are you gonna stop
being mad at me?

14:03.726 --> 14:05.760
- When you stop
arresting my friends.

14:05.794 --> 14:07.528
- She committed a crime

14:07.563 --> 14:09.030
in front
of a rookie officer

14:09.064 --> 14:10.698
who was watching
my every move.

14:10.733 --> 14:12.633
She was selling
a controlled substance.

14:12.668 --> 14:14.702
- Will you stop being
such a narc?

14:14.737 --> 14:16.304
- But I am a narc.

14:16.338 --> 14:18.005
It--it's on my badge, see?

14:18.040 --> 14:19.173
I'm in narcotics.

14:19.208 --> 14:20.408
- Officer szymborska,

14:20.442 --> 14:22.043
chief has arrived
and is ready for you.

14:22.077 --> 14:23.211
- On my way.

14:23.245 --> 14:25.413
I gotta go.

14:25.447 --> 14:27.248
Um, I'm, uh, kind of getting
a commendation

14:27.282 --> 14:29.584
for all the, uh, arrests
I've been making.

14:29.618 --> 14:31.686
Um, there's also a dinner.

14:31.720 --> 14:33.321
Should I put down plus one?

14:33.355 --> 14:34.922
Right.

14:34.957 --> 14:38.960
I'm calling you
later, though.

14:38.994 --> 14:39.994
- Hey, jailbirds.

14:40.028 --> 14:41.329
I smuggled in breath mints.

14:41.363 --> 14:42.930
- That's the least
of our problems.

14:42.965 --> 14:45.666
- Not the least.

14:45.701 --> 14:49.570
- Ladies, I have
the most amazing news.

14:49.605 --> 14:51.205
In our mailbox,

14:51.240 --> 14:53.107
we received
from an anonymous donor

14:53.142 --> 14:54.742
a cashier's check.

14:54.777 --> 14:56.377
There's enough here
to free Elka

14:56.412 --> 14:58.946
and get me to Chicago
for my Botox.

14:58.981 --> 15:00.948
- That's great!
- Oh, thank God.

15:00.983 --> 15:02.383
- What about me?

15:02.418 --> 15:04.852
- Oh, yes.
You.

15:04.887 --> 15:06.954
Well, you seem to be
holding up rather well.

15:06.989 --> 15:10.491
These vertical lines
are just so slimming.

15:10.526 --> 15:12.160
- I can't believe

15:12.194 --> 15:13.761
you're choosing
injections of botulism

15:13.796 --> 15:14.929
over your best friend.

15:14.963 --> 15:15.930
Doesn't that worry you?

15:15.964 --> 15:17.732
- Well, yes, of course it does.

15:17.766 --> 15:19.934
But I figure
if I can get to Chicago,

15:19.968 --> 15:23.371
then at least
I won't look worried.

15:28.877 --> 15:29.944
- You know, Rick,

15:29.978 --> 15:31.279
in all the years
you've been my Agent,

15:31.313 --> 15:33.514
I've always refused
to do nudity.

15:33.549 --> 15:35.183
But now I--

15:35.217 --> 15:38.519
well, you could at least
let me finish the sentence.

15:38.554 --> 15:41.522
You see what poverty
has reduced me to.

15:41.557 --> 15:43.191
My life is over.

15:43.225 --> 15:44.659
- Victoria, come on.

15:44.693 --> 15:45.893
We're here to celebrate.

15:45.928 --> 15:47.094
- Yes, you're right.

15:47.129 --> 15:50.498
Two of my pals
just got out of prison.

15:50.532 --> 15:55.002
Oh, my God, I sound
white trash already.

15:55.037 --> 15:56.237
By this time tomorrow,

15:56.271 --> 15:57.605
I'll be listening
to skynyrd

15:57.639 --> 15:59.640
and wearing a tube top.

15:59.675 --> 16:01.409
- Who do you have to shank

16:01.443 --> 16:03.845
to get a drink
around here?

16:03.879 --> 16:07.582
- I'll go check
what the holdup is.

16:07.616 --> 16:09.650
Excuse me, bartender.

16:09.685 --> 16:11.219
- Oh, hello, Joy.

16:11.253 --> 16:13.955
Everyone's admiring
my balls.

16:13.989 --> 16:15.890
- Your baseballs.

16:15.924 --> 16:17.325
- In this case, yes.

16:17.359 --> 16:19.660
I sold a few of them
to the bar.

16:19.695 --> 16:21.863
There's Bob Feller,
Al Rosen,

16:21.897 --> 16:23.431
Rocky Colavito.

16:23.465 --> 16:24.465
- You sold all these?

16:24.500 --> 16:25.466
- Mm-Hmm.

16:25.501 --> 16:27.268
- Wait a minute.

16:27.302 --> 16:29.303
You're the anonymous donor,
aren't you?

16:29.338 --> 16:31.806
- Guilty.
- Wow, Rick.

16:31.840 --> 16:34.041
That truly was
a lovely thing to do.

16:34.076 --> 16:36.177
- Well, merely squaring
a debt.

16:36.211 --> 16:37.745
You may find this
hard to believe,

16:37.779 --> 16:42.416
but mine was an awkward
and lonely youth.

16:42.451 --> 16:45.486
Elka gave me
my first ball.

16:45.521 --> 16:48.723
I thought my head
was going to explode.

16:48.757 --> 16:52.326
- Please start saying,
"baseball."

16:52.361 --> 16:53.528
- In this case,

16:53.562 --> 16:57.331
it's best to leave it
ambiguous.

16:59.368 --> 17:01.369
She was very giving
to me

17:01.403 --> 17:02.637
when I needed it
the most,

17:02.671 --> 17:04.972
and--and on that day,

17:05.007 --> 17:09.944
a 35-year-old
became a man.

17:09.978 --> 17:11.112
- Well.

17:11.146 --> 17:14.214
Whatever the reason,
we're grateful.

17:14.249 --> 17:15.583
You know,

17:15.617 --> 17:17.251
about your earlier offer.

17:17.286 --> 17:20.922
- Oh, the one that you
so summarily rejected?

17:20.955 --> 17:22.323
- Yes, well,
thing have changed,

17:22.357 --> 17:24.392
and I need a green card
right away,

17:24.425 --> 17:26.827
so here goes.

17:26.862 --> 17:28.563
I'm so desperate.

17:28.597 --> 17:29.797
I guess I will marry you.

17:29.831 --> 17:31.866
Oh, I'm sorry.

17:31.900 --> 17:35.136
That can't be how you pictured
a proposal response.

17:35.170 --> 17:38.039
- No, that's exactly
how I pictured it.

17:38.073 --> 17:39.574
I'm a realist.

17:39.608 --> 17:41.609
But I didn't ask you again.

17:41.643 --> 17:43.344
- Oh, okay.
Go ahead.

17:43.378 --> 17:44.779
- Not so fast.

17:44.813 --> 17:47.882
The tables have turned.

17:47.916 --> 17:50.718
I'd like you
to do the asking.

17:50.752 --> 17:52.620
- Okay.

17:52.654 --> 17:54.422
- In the traditional manner.

18:00.596 --> 18:02.129
- Why is Joy getting
down on her knees

18:02.164 --> 18:04.932
in front of Rick?

18:04.967 --> 18:07.969
- Prison changes a woman.

18:15.059 --> 18:17.427
- Well.
I have news.

18:17.461 --> 18:19.829
Elka, Rick was the one
who bailed you out.

18:19.863 --> 18:23.566
- Why, that dear, sweet,

18:23.600 --> 18:26.069
surprisingly tender boy.

18:26.103 --> 18:27.070
- Wait a minute.

18:27.104 --> 18:28.538
Are you saying
that he's rich?

18:28.572 --> 18:31.774
- Back off.
He's mine.

18:31.809 --> 18:32.942
- Hey, wait a minute.

18:32.976 --> 18:35.445
I'm the only one
who's seen him naked.

18:35.479 --> 18:37.914
- You keep thinking that.

18:42.753 --> 18:46.889
- What I'm saying is,
we're engaged.

18:46.924 --> 18:48.391
- What?

18:48.425 --> 18:50.359
- Joy, how are we supposed
to feel about this?

18:50.394 --> 18:52.161
- Well--

18:52.196 --> 18:54.430
It's the only way
I can stay in this country.

18:54.465 --> 18:55.631
So we have to make it seem

18:55.666 --> 18:57.467
very real
and believable.

18:57.501 --> 18:58.968
So...

18:59.002 --> 19:00.536
I'm engaged!

19:02.906 --> 19:04.807
- I'll be right back.

19:04.842 --> 19:06.476
- That's your fiancee?

19:06.510 --> 19:08.010
Wow.

19:08.045 --> 19:09.078
You must be...

19:09.113 --> 19:11.881
- yes, yes, I am.

19:11.915 --> 19:13.950
I'd like a bottle
of your best champagne

19:13.984 --> 19:17.153
and a side order
of your telephone number.

19:17.187 --> 19:19.555
Nothing lasts forever.

19:19.590 --> 19:21.491
- You're terrible.

19:21.525 --> 19:23.726
- Oh, I know.

19:23.760 --> 19:25.228
- Ricky.

19:25.262 --> 19:27.029
- Elka.

19:27.064 --> 19:28.564
A vision, as always.

19:28.599 --> 19:30.266
- I just wanted
to thank you

19:30.300 --> 19:31.601
for what you did
for me.

19:31.635 --> 19:33.569
- No, I want
to thank you

19:33.604 --> 19:34.937
for what you did
for me.

19:34.972 --> 19:39.575
We will always have
the summer of '97.

19:39.610 --> 19:43.045
- Blame it on coolio.

19:49.620 --> 19:50.586
- Melanie.

19:50.621 --> 19:51.821
- Pete, I'm not talking
to you.

19:51.855 --> 19:53.489
- You don't have to speak
to me.

19:53.524 --> 19:55.992
Just listen.

19:56.026 --> 19:59.295
Look, I-I'm sorry
that doing my job

19:59.329 --> 20:00.563
has hurt our relationship.

20:00.597 --> 20:02.732
But I'd be even sorrier
if I didn't tell you

20:02.766 --> 20:06.435
what's been on my mind
all day.

20:06.470 --> 20:08.204
Last night,
in the tornado,

20:08.238 --> 20:09.672
I heard you yell,
"I love you."

20:09.706 --> 20:11.607
But when I started
to yell it back,

20:11.642 --> 20:12.675
some leaves flew
into my mouth,

20:12.709 --> 20:15.511
and it ruined the moment.

20:15.546 --> 20:18.881
So maybe you don't want
to hear it right now,

20:18.916 --> 20:20.683
but...

20:20.717 --> 20:23.019
I love you too.

20:23.053 --> 20:25.021
- Oh, Pete.
I love you too.

20:25.055 --> 20:27.423
- Oh.

20:29.726 --> 20:33.162
- What's the screw
doing here?

20:35.199 --> 20:36.799
- He told me
he loved me,

20:36.833 --> 20:38.534
so we're not mad
at him anymore.

20:38.569 --> 20:40.670
And he's gonna stop
arresting my friends, right?

20:40.704 --> 20:42.638
- Champagne for everyone!
- Ah.

20:42.673 --> 20:43.839
- Oh, what are we
celebrating?

20:43.874 --> 20:48.578
- Joy's fake engagement
to get a green card.

20:48.612 --> 20:52.181
Got a problem
with that, <i>puerco?</i>

20:57.287 --> 20:59.589
- Congratulations.

20:59.623 --> 21:00.690
- A toast.

21:00.724 --> 21:04.193
To losing my balls
and getting a wife.

21:05.862 --> 21:08.164
- Sounds like a real marriage
to me.
