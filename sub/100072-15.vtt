00:35.244 --> 00:37.578
What's up, fellas?
What can I get you guys tonight?

00:37.579 --> 00:38.621
- Beer.
- Beer.

00:38.622 --> 00:40.039
- Beer.
- I'll have just, like, a...

00:40.040 --> 00:41.540
a chicken salad or something.

00:41.541 --> 00:43.341
- What?
- Chicken salad.

00:43.342 --> 00:44.641
Or whatever's easiest.

00:44.642 --> 00:46.045
Probably chicken salad.

00:46.046 --> 00:50.086
Hey, uh, Jerome, can you give us
a minute to discuss <i> this</i>

00:50.087 --> 00:51.509
as a group?

00:51.510 --> 00:54.053
Quagmire, excuse
my Wisconsin mouth, but...

00:54.054 --> 00:55.805
Why the heck are you not drinkin',

00:55.806 --> 00:57.556
for cripes' sake?

00:57.557 --> 01:00.226
Are you doing the keto diet
so you lose a bunch of weight

01:00.227 --> 01:03.062
and it makes you look
like you got a mascot head?

01:03.063 --> 01:05.899
No, I'm on medication,
so I can't drink, okay?

01:05.900 --> 01:07.441
And I'm not gonna say what it's for.

01:07.442 --> 01:10.111
I'll-I'll just say the
pharmacist whispers it to me.

01:10.112 --> 01:12.154
So you haven't been drinking all week?

01:12.155 --> 01:13.612
What <i> have</i> you been doing?

01:13.613 --> 01:15.241
Just mostly going to bed early.

01:15.242 --> 01:16.617
Like <i> really</i> early.

01:16.618 --> 01:18.411
Like so early
you still hear people outside

01:18.412 --> 01:19.787
mowing their lawns.

01:19.788 --> 01:22.248
But it's not that bad...
Th-there's plenty of sober stuff

01:22.249 --> 01:25.017
- we can do together.
- Ugh, like what? Fly kites?

01:25.018 --> 01:27.628
That's stupid, or is it?
I'm in. I have a kite in my car.

01:27.629 --> 01:29.130
What about an escape room?

01:29.131 --> 01:32.091
If we can't drink, we might
as well lock ourselves in a room

01:32.092 --> 01:33.384
with no windows.

01:33.385 --> 01:35.177
Cleveland, I could kiss you!

01:35.178 --> 01:36.929
My heart says yes,

01:36.930 --> 01:39.683
but my Lord says no.

01:44.145 --> 01:47.735
Hello, puzzlers.
Welcome to my escape room!

01:47.736 --> 01:49.275
For those of you
who've never played before,

01:49.276 --> 01:50.609
the game is simple.

01:50.610 --> 01:52.361
You will all be locked
in identical rooms

01:52.362 --> 01:54.030
where you will solve a series of puzzles

01:54.031 --> 01:56.282
using clues hidden around the room.

01:56.283 --> 01:59.076
First family to escape wins!

01:59.077 --> 02:00.995
Will-will there be fractions?

02:00.996 --> 02:03.099
I was told there would be no fractions.

02:03.100 --> 02:04.980
Well, whoever told you that
was <i> half</i> right.

02:04.981 --> 02:06.083
Eh?

02:06.084 --> 02:07.754
Now, I know what
some of you are thinking.

02:07.755 --> 02:10.545
Yes, I look like a man
who owns domestic rats.

02:10.547 --> 02:13.466
Yes, I <i> do</i> own domestic rats.

02:13.467 --> 02:15.718
Yes, they've eaten a few of my toes.

02:15.719 --> 02:17.678
Yes, the rats are missing.

02:17.679 --> 02:20.139
Yes, this current talk
is being videotaped

02:20.140 --> 02:23.142
and will be used as my legal
release of responsibility

02:23.143 --> 02:25.978
if aforementioned
toe-eating rats were to nibble,

02:25.979 --> 02:29.261
bite or maul any of
the present participants' toes.

02:29.262 --> 02:31.317
Yes, it's held up in court before.

02:31.318 --> 02:34.820
Yes, this is the "odd speech"
cited in our Yelp reviews.

02:34.821 --> 02:36.365
But most importantly...

02:36.366 --> 02:39.033
have fun...!

02:39.034 --> 02:41.243
You guys want to bet
on who finishes first? Huh?

02:41.244 --> 02:44.038
I had a night coffee,
so I'm feeling jazzed.

02:44.039 --> 02:47.041
; Well, I... I don't
know if we should be betting.

02:47.042 --> 02:49.418
Our family kind of has
an unfair advantage.

02:49.419 --> 02:51.837
I mean, I'm a detective.

02:51.838 --> 02:53.255
- No.
- Okay.

02:53.256 --> 02:55.674
So what? Peter's made for these games.

02:55.675 --> 02:58.052
He's got a big fat puzzle-solving brain.

02:58.053 --> 03:00.429
I mean, look at his head. It's huge!

03:00.430 --> 03:02.974
- Look at it!
- Yeah, yeah, look at it.

03:04.184 --> 03:06.185
Hey, Chris, you want an edible?

03:06.186 --> 03:07.895
Meg?!

03:07.896 --> 03:09.185
Yes.

03:13.068 --> 03:14.777
"Welcome, Detectives."

03:14.778 --> 03:17.405
I love this already.

03:17.406 --> 03:19.240
Uh, "A client needs your help.

03:19.241 --> 03:21.909
"His name is in the address book
in your desk,

03:21.910 --> 03:23.702
"but you can't find the key.

03:23.703 --> 03:26.372
"Try looking
in the last place you left them.

03:26.373 --> 03:28.791
They might be hanging around."

03:28.792 --> 03:30.376
Okay, where do people leave their keys

03:30.377 --> 03:32.002
when they come into a room?

03:32.003 --> 03:33.963
In the coat on the coat rack.

03:33.964 --> 03:36.382
Oh, oh, I know, I know.
In the corner of the room,

03:36.383 --> 03:38.217
'cause you threw 'em
at a ceiling spider.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.510
Yes! Check there!

03:39.511 --> 03:40.970
We don't need a key.

03:40.971 --> 03:43.722
I'll just yank on
the desk drawer until it opens.

03:43.723 --> 03:45.725
Strength over brains!

03:59.864 --> 04:03.075
Yes! This fat head
is already paying dividends!

04:03.076 --> 04:04.784
Okay.

04:07.289 --> 04:08.795
It was a trap.

04:08.796 --> 04:13.002
Everything on Groupon is just a
trick to <i> Get Out</i> black people.

04:13.003 --> 04:14.212
Aah, we're sinking.

04:14.797 --> 04:16.589
All right, the name in the address book

04:16.589 --> 04:18.173
is Anthony Fibonacci.

04:18.175 --> 04:21.802
Phone number: 235-blank-blank-3-

04:21.803 --> 04:23.730
blank-blank-blank-blank.

04:23.731 --> 04:25.097
Those missing numbers are...

04:25.098 --> 04:27.141
Chris, stop picking your elbow scab.

04:27.142 --> 04:29.101
- It'll never heal.
- It'll heal.

04:29.102 --> 04:30.853
The missing numbers are what we need

04:30.854 --> 04:32.813
to unlock the keypad on the door.

04:32.814 --> 04:34.982
Okay. Fibonacci... That's Italian.

04:34.983 --> 04:37.443
So maybe if I just
start saying Italian stuff,

04:37.444 --> 04:39.945
I'll say the answer. Spaghetti.

04:39.946 --> 04:41.322
Spaghetti.

04:41.323 --> 04:42.948
<i>Mario Kart.</i>

04:42.949 --> 04:44.158
Pizza Hut.

04:44.159 --> 04:46.118
Look at those idiots.
Their thought process

04:46.119 --> 04:48.329
always involves food
or cultural stereotypes.

04:48.330 --> 04:50.372
Hitting a kid with a wooden spoon.

04:50.373 --> 04:51.957
I mean, the answer is obvious.

04:51.958 --> 04:54.126
I know. Totally.

04:54.127 --> 04:56.128
Oh, oh, you're waiting for me
to keep going.

04:56.129 --> 04:57.505
The name is Fibonacci.

04:57.506 --> 05:00.132
Kissing a cross
before you get-a on a airplane.

05:00.133 --> 05:03.427
Fibonacci is also a reference
to a sequence of numbers

05:03.428 --> 05:05.137
where every number after the first two

05:05.138 --> 05:07.306
is the sum of the two preceding ones.

05:07.307 --> 05:10.309
It's from <i> The Da Vinci Code,</i>
and the answer is 2-3-5-

05:10.310 --> 05:12.270
8-1-3-2-1-3-4.

05:13.438 --> 05:15.035
Guys, guys, guys,
you're thinking too hard.

05:15.037 --> 05:16.106
The answer is simple.

05:16.107 --> 05:18.317
Fibonacci is the name of a number man

05:18.318 --> 05:21.028
from <i> The Da Vinci Code,</i>
which was written by Tom Hanks,

05:21.029 --> 05:22.196
so the number is...

05:25.659 --> 05:29.370
Yes!<i> That</i> is why you bring a dog
with you everywhere you go.

05:29.371 --> 05:32.206
Even in Target, 'cause
who's gonna tell you you can't?

05:32.207 --> 05:33.541
The dead-eyed employees?

05:33.542 --> 05:35.167
No. No, they won't.

05:35.168 --> 05:37.212
'Cause they're cowards.

05:39.381 --> 05:41.924
- Sir? Sir?
- What?!

05:41.925 --> 05:44.010
Nothing, it's stupid.
I'm-I'm... I'm sorry.

05:48.250 --> 05:50.224
Hey, Stewie,
we really crushed it last night

05:50.225 --> 05:51.433
in that escape room, huh?

05:51.434 --> 05:52.851
Ugh, don't say "crushed"

05:52.852 --> 05:54.520
like you're trying
to sell me a Range Rover.

05:54.521 --> 05:55.896
<i>I</i> did well, Brian.

05:55.897 --> 05:57.898
You just copied my answer
and took credit.

05:57.899 --> 05:59.191
Whatever, Stewie. I don't know why

05:59.192 --> 06:01.026
I always need your validation.

06:01.027 --> 06:03.445
I should just let you enjoy
your superior intellect

06:03.446 --> 06:04.780
while you still have it.

06:04.781 --> 06:06.031
What does that mean?

06:06.032 --> 06:08.702
Oh. Did you think you were the
only smart baby in this family?

06:08.703 --> 06:10.912
Chris and Meg were
just as smart as you were.

06:13.582 --> 06:15.541
But once a Griffin hits puberty,

06:15.542 --> 06:17.376
they turn into a full-blown bozo.

06:17.377 --> 06:18.667
Bozo the Clown?

06:18.668 --> 06:20.212
Yes, of course. Bozo the Clown.

06:20.213 --> 06:21.463
What other Bozos are there?

06:21.464 --> 06:23.366
I... I don't know,

06:23.367 --> 06:25.593
Bozo the tax accountant?

06:25.594 --> 06:28.554
Well, the good news is, since
you do a sex advice podcast...

06:28.555 --> 06:31.223
Which I really like,
by the way... every time you...

06:31.224 --> 06:33.058
it's a write-off.

06:33.059 --> 06:35.060
- Really?
- Oh, yeah. And not just...

06:35.061 --> 06:36.562
also...

06:36.563 --> 06:38.714
and even...

06:39.733 --> 06:42.276
Are you kidding me?

06:42.277 --> 06:44.195
Do I look like I'm kidding?

06:48.491 --> 06:50.071
Whoa, what's this?

06:58.710 --> 07:00.919
This is my new invention:

07:00.920 --> 07:03.339
a gene-altering device, or GAD.

07:03.340 --> 07:05.762
Josh, if I'm feeling informal.

07:05.763 --> 07:07.593
I thought about what you said yesterday

07:07.594 --> 07:09.094
about me growing up stupid.

07:09.095 --> 07:11.180
So I decided to do something about it.

07:11.181 --> 07:13.182
I can't control the DNA I was given,

07:13.183 --> 07:16.226
but now I can control
the DNA I want to keep.

07:16.227 --> 07:17.603
Stewie, that's crazy.

07:17.604 --> 07:18.937
No, it's not.

07:18.938 --> 07:20.606
Genetic modification is a real thing.

07:20.607 --> 07:22.608
It's going to change the world,

07:22.609 --> 07:25.402
just like James Taylor
changed rock and roll.

07:25.403 --> 07:27.112
Hello, Martha's Vineyard.

07:27.113 --> 07:29.698
Are you ready to watch me
play guitar on a stool?

07:29.699 --> 07:30.783
Yes. Thank you.

07:30.784 --> 07:32.326
No, thank <i> you.</i>

07:32.327 --> 07:35.372
Now, here's a song that's
basically directions to Boston.

07:41.001 --> 07:44.585
All right, I've put in all my
desired genetic modifications.

07:44.587 --> 07:46.607
Any last words before I go in?

07:46.608 --> 07:48.467
Yeah, don't you think
you're being a little dramatic?

07:48.468 --> 07:50.094
Yes. Thank you.

07:50.095 --> 07:52.304
Stewie, I'm serious.
Messing around with your DNA

07:52.305 --> 07:54.348
could have dire consequences.

07:54.349 --> 07:56.350
Haven't you ever seen the movie <i> Splice?</i>

07:56.351 --> 07:59.186
Yeah, no, and take that <i> Citizen</i>
<i>Kane</i> tone out of your voice.

07:59.187 --> 08:00.519
It's <i> Splice.</i>

Doggy. Big doggy.

08:54.534 --> 08:56.118
Oh, my God.

08:56.119 --> 08:59.538
I think taking out that DNA
turned you into a regular baby.

08:59.539 --> 09:02.459
Ha! Should've watched <i>Splice,</i> bro.

09:09.713 --> 09:11.383
Doggy.

09:11.384 --> 09:12.718
Big doggy.

That's right. The big doggy.

09:15.305 --> 09:16.597
Good evening, folks.

09:16.598 --> 09:17.806
Would you like to hear
tonight's specials?

09:17.807 --> 09:19.975
Bah, bah, bah, bah, ooh, bah, bah, bah!

09:19.976 --> 09:21.310
That was loud.

09:21.311 --> 09:23.520
So, what's everyone gonna get?

09:23.521 --> 09:25.397
Hey, Chris, watch. I bet she orders

09:25.398 --> 09:28.025
the eggplant parmesan
like it's something fancy.

09:28.026 --> 09:30.068
I'm thinking the eggplant parmesan.

09:30.069 --> 09:32.321
It'll be like we're in Italy!

09:32.322 --> 09:34.615
Ha! Our family should wear uniforms

09:34.616 --> 09:36.992
with "Basic Bitches" across the front.

09:36.993 --> 09:38.786
What's wrong with eggplant parmesan?

09:38.787 --> 09:40.078
Nothing. I was just making a joke.

09:40.079 --> 09:41.497
Stewie and I do it all the time.

09:41.498 --> 09:42.998
Stewie is a baby.

09:42.999 --> 09:45.334
You bad-mouth our family to the baby?

09:45.335 --> 09:47.169
Forget it. Forget I said anything.

09:47.170 --> 09:48.587
Mom! Dad!

09:48.588 --> 09:51.423
Brian's talking crap
about you guys to Stewie!

09:51.424 --> 09:53.008
- What?
- No, I wasn't.

09:53.009 --> 09:56.428
Yeah, he was. He said we're
a bunch of basic bitches.

09:56.429 --> 09:58.222
It's kinda true, yo.

09:58.223 --> 10:00.516
Brian, if I was such a basic bitch,

10:00.517 --> 10:03.273
would I be wearing
solid black umpire's shoes?

10:03.274 --> 10:04.770
Umpires are cool.

10:04.771 --> 10:06.063
They make the rules.

10:07.607 --> 10:08.858
Water out!

10:08.859 --> 10:10.723
Are umpires not cool?

10:10.724 --> 10:12.110
I'm starting to feel foolish.

10:12.111 --> 10:14.613
Where the hell is my white wine
with Sprite in it?!

10:14.614 --> 10:17.199
Hi again. That man over there
reading a book by himself

10:17.200 --> 10:20.452
has offered to pay for your meal
if you move to a table outside.

10:20.453 --> 10:22.538
You're not the dick in this situation.

10:22.539 --> 10:24.874
You're paying for their meal,
so you can't be the dick.

10:29.546 --> 10:31.421
- Cup.
- Yeah, cup. Wow.

10:31.422 --> 10:33.423
All right, time to go, everybody.

10:33.424 --> 10:34.967
What? Where are we going?

10:34.968 --> 10:37.177
My cousin's getting married
this weekend.

10:37.178 --> 10:39.721
Brian, I need your help
with Stewie on the flight.

10:39.722 --> 10:42.215
- Sure, no problem.
- The iPad's broken.

10:42.216 --> 10:43.432
(BLEEP)

10:45.645 --> 10:47.062
- Brian face.
- Mm-hmm.

10:47.063 --> 10:48.647
- Brian face.
- Yup.

10:48.648 --> 10:51.316
- Brian face.
- Only a few more now.

10:51.317 --> 10:53.819
Okay. All right.

10:53.820 --> 10:56.071
Got to be getting tired soon.

10:56.072 --> 10:58.031
You see, when young kids act out,

10:58.032 --> 11:00.826
what they're really doing
is asking to be heard.

11:00.827 --> 11:03.036
They have very little control
in their lives,

11:03.037 --> 11:06.206
so the key, and I mean <i> key...</i>

11:06.207 --> 11:07.916
is to make them an active participant

11:07.917 --> 11:09.334
in these decisions.

11:09.335 --> 11:11.044
And once you do that...

11:11.045 --> 11:14.840
you'll see... a big... difference.

11:14.841 --> 11:17.759
Hi. Can I get some
of those tiny square napkins?

11:17.760 --> 11:20.679
Yeah, like-like
the most you're allowed to give.

11:20.680 --> 11:22.180
Now the bride and groom

11:22.181 --> 11:24.676
would like to share a moment of silence

11:24.677 --> 11:27.352
to honor the family members
who have passed.

11:27.353 --> 11:29.990
They may not be with us in person,

11:29.991 --> 11:32.483
but they are with us in spirit.

11:33.526 --> 11:34.860
- Poo-poo.
- No!

11:34.861 --> 11:37.279
We do not touch poo-poo in this family.

11:37.280 --> 11:38.697
We do not touch poo-poo.

11:38.698 --> 11:40.198
No! Hands up.

11:40.199 --> 11:42.075
That's it. Now there's no bubbles later.

11:42.076 --> 11:44.119
- Yes, bubbles!
- No bubbles.

11:44.120 --> 11:46.246
- You lost the bubbles.
- Yes, bubbles!

11:46.247 --> 11:47.581
Maybe you can earn them back.

11:47.582 --> 11:49.708
But as far as I'm concerned,
you've lost the bubbles.

11:49.709 --> 11:51.544
They're gone. They're probably gone.

11:52.795 --> 11:54.422
Yay, bubbles!

11:56.382 --> 11:58.009
What?!

12:02.804 --> 12:04.848
I think it's time
to change you back, Stewie.

12:04.849 --> 12:07.559
As much as I hated being around
a condescending baby,

12:07.560 --> 12:10.395
I prefer that to a screaming bag
of leaking crap.

12:10.396 --> 12:11.940
Brian face.

12:14.442 --> 12:16.569
All right, how do I use this thing?

12:19.280 --> 12:21.406
These are all just sketches of Stewie

12:21.407 --> 12:23.493
with different Hemsworth haircuts.

12:26.204 --> 12:28.580
It's got to be
on the computer somewhere.

12:28.581 --> 12:30.207
Here.

12:30.208 --> 12:33.585
"Restore original DNA profile." Yes.

12:33.586 --> 12:36.964
"Would you like to add
a Hemsworth haircut?" No.

12:36.965 --> 12:38.507
"Are you sure?" Yes.

12:38.508 --> 12:40.175
"Really?" Yes.

12:40.176 --> 12:42.094
"Would you like to first see a photo

12:42.095 --> 12:44.763
of what you're turning down?" No.

12:44.764 --> 12:46.099
"Too bad."

12:48.349 --> 12:50.477
Just restore DNA.

12:54.107 --> 12:57.526
Whoops. "Edit, undo."

12:57.527 --> 13:00.612
Uh-oh. "Edit, redo."

13:00.613 --> 13:04.116
My God, I can't get back
to regular Stewie.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.492
What am I gonna do?

13:05.493 --> 13:07.495
I better go rewatch <i> Splice.</i>

13:16.671 --> 13:18.964
<i>This is Peter Griffin's Penis Video.</i>

13:18.965 --> 13:20.383
<i>Take one.</i>

13:21.134 --> 13:22.467
Oh, my God.

13:22.468 --> 13:24.302
What do you think, bud?

13:24.303 --> 13:27.207
There's a Q and A
with the cast afterwards.

13:32.726 --> 13:34.854
No.

13:34.855 --> 13:36.690
- No.
- Stewiechu.

13:36.691 --> 13:38.108
No.

13:38.109 --> 13:41.153
Aw, he's gonna hate me
for changing this one.

13:41.154 --> 13:43.582
- Hello?
- Stewie?

13:43.583 --> 13:45.741
Brian, is my mouth in my butt?

13:45.742 --> 13:48.160
Yeah, my mouth's in my butt.

13:48.161 --> 13:51.704
- You got to fix this.
- I'm trying.

13:51.705 --> 13:53.331
Brian, where's my butt?

13:53.332 --> 13:55.918
No. No. No.

13:57.792 --> 13:59.046
Brian, you did it.

13:59.047 --> 14:00.589
No. Oh, (BLEEP)!

14:00.590 --> 14:01.799
Sorry. (BLEEP)

14:16.522 --> 14:18.391
You can fix this.

14:18.392 --> 14:19.739
You just need a little help.

14:19.740 --> 14:21.359
Just like how Sylvester Stallone

14:21.360 --> 14:23.070
needs help getting ready in the morning.

14:23.071 --> 14:24.529
So, what are we thinking this morning?

14:24.530 --> 14:26.531
I don't know. I like big face.

14:26.532 --> 14:29.743
Big, fat face.
Goatee with little, tiny eyes.

14:29.744 --> 14:31.870
Okay. And what about for your body?

14:31.871 --> 14:34.414
Yeah, you know, veins.
All kinds of veins everywhere.

14:34.415 --> 14:36.626
L-Little rivers everywhere.

14:46.260 --> 14:48.968
So, do you think you can help me
get him back to normal?

14:48.969 --> 14:50.388
You came to the right guy.

14:50.389 --> 14:52.265
But first I'm gonna need a few things.

14:52.266 --> 14:54.351
- Of course, anything.
- Go to the kitchen

14:54.352 --> 14:55.727
and grab eight to ten dish towels.

14:55.728 --> 14:58.396
Tear 'em in half and lay 'em
on the floor in my room.

14:58.397 --> 14:59.898
Then I need two AA batteries.

14:59.899 --> 15:02.526
After that, go to Shake Shack
and pick up four burgers.

15:02.527 --> 15:04.111
Doesn't matter which ones.
They're all good.

15:04.112 --> 15:06.238
- How is that gonna help?
- You'll see!

15:06.239 --> 15:07.948
Finally, I need you to sew

15:07.949 --> 15:10.700
the long plastic tube
from the vacuum cleaner

15:10.701 --> 15:12.994
- onto this pair of underwear.
- Come on, Chris.

15:12.995 --> 15:14.621
Hey, you came to me, damn it.

15:14.622 --> 15:18.084
I can fix this,
but not if you don't trust me.

15:19.127 --> 15:21.753
Chris? It's been three hours.

15:21.754 --> 15:23.089
Any updates?

15:24.257 --> 15:27.426
You don't want to be in here, dude.

15:37.266 --> 15:38.672
Stewie, I need your help.

15:38.673 --> 15:39.938
I know that there's got to be

15:39.939 --> 15:42.409
a part of you inside there
that can understand me,

15:42.410 --> 15:44.484
and maybe Rupert can help you remember.

15:44.485 --> 15:47.279
Remember Rupert? He's your best friend

15:47.280 --> 15:49.700
with whom you seem to have
a very sexual past.

15:57.874 --> 15:59.708
Yes, it's working.

15:59.709 --> 16:02.127
It's Rupert. Nice Rupert.

16:02.128 --> 16:04.212
Stewie loves Rupert.

16:05.464 --> 16:06.965
What the hell?

16:06.966 --> 16:09.050
Hello?

16:09.051 --> 16:10.635
<i>- Stewie!</i>
- Uh, no Stewie.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.179
<i>- Stewie!</i>
- No Stewie.

16:12.180 --> 16:14.688
Brian, is Stewie in there?

16:14.689 --> 16:16.641
<i>- Stewie!</i>
- No Stewie. Uh...

16:16.642 --> 16:19.477
His preschool teacher said
he took home the Flat Stanley

16:19.478 --> 16:21.188
this weekend, and she needs it back.

16:21.189 --> 16:23.148
<i>- Stewie!</i>
- Open the door.

16:23.149 --> 16:25.025
Uh, no, no, no.
I'll-I'll... I'll find it.

16:25.026 --> 16:26.609
<i>Stewie!</i>

16:26.610 --> 16:28.195
- No Stewie.
- Hi, Brian.

16:28.196 --> 16:29.735
I got a trampoline.

16:29.736 --> 16:31.072
<i>- Stewie!</i>
- No Stewie.

16:31.073 --> 16:32.657
Fat guys go high.

16:32.658 --> 16:33.911
I don't know how to stop.

16:33.912 --> 16:35.952
Let me in. Where's Stewie?

16:35.953 --> 16:37.329
- Stewie!
- No Stewie!

16:37.330 --> 16:39.080
Is this my forever?

16:39.081 --> 16:41.666
Everything is fine.
Just nobody come in or look in.

16:41.667 --> 16:43.840
Stewie was right. I am an idiot.

16:43.841 --> 16:46.087
I wish I could go back to before
this whole thing happened

16:46.088 --> 16:47.586
and tell him he's right.

16:47.587 --> 16:49.174
Wait, I can go back.

16:49.175 --> 16:50.718
Stewie's time machine.

16:52.011 --> 16:54.638
Oh, there he is.
Wish me luck, Flat Stanley.

16:57.475 --> 16:59.726
Or you could just call me Stanley.

16:59.727 --> 17:01.686
Not make fun of my body.

17:11.196 --> 17:13.656
Oh, no. What did you do?

17:13.657 --> 17:16.076
A lot. You can't go
in this machine, Stewie.

17:16.077 --> 17:18.869
Removing those parts of your DNA
doesn't make you smarter.

17:18.871 --> 17:20.955
It just turns you into a regular baby.

17:20.957 --> 17:23.083
That's impossible.
My science is correct.

17:23.084 --> 17:26.044
I know, but I may not have been
telling you the truth

17:26.045 --> 17:27.631
about Chris being a smart baby.

17:27.632 --> 17:29.140
But he solved a Rubik's Cube.

17:29.141 --> 17:30.300
I saw the video.

17:31.550 --> 17:33.802
I played it in reverse.

17:33.803 --> 17:35.262
He wasn't solving one.

17:35.263 --> 17:36.847
He was eating one.

17:37.721 --> 17:39.057
You're not gonna grow up to be dumb.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.101
You're gonna grow up to be you.

17:41.102 --> 17:43.853
Who's way smarter than me.

17:43.854 --> 17:45.563
So you're saying that somehow,

17:45.564 --> 17:48.568
all my smooshed-together,
crappy Griffin DNA

17:48.569 --> 17:50.568
is actually what makes me smart?

17:50.569 --> 17:52.320
Yeah, I think so.

17:52.321 --> 17:53.738
I suppose it's possible.

17:53.739 --> 17:56.514
Well, I guess there's
only one thing left to do.

17:56.515 --> 17:58.451
- What's that?
- By traveling back here,

17:58.452 --> 18:00.161
you've created a new timeline.

18:00.162 --> 18:02.247
For everything to revert back to normal,

18:02.248 --> 18:04.262
you have to drown your past self
in the toilet.

18:05.293 --> 18:06.960
Hey, Stewie.

18:11.921 --> 18:14.009
W-W-Wait, wait, wait, no, no, sorry.

18:14.010 --> 18:15.343
- Sorry, I have it backwards.
- What?

18:15.344 --> 18:17.304
You're supposed to be drowning
your future self.

18:17.305 --> 18:19.139
You came back. You're the new timeline.

18:19.140 --> 18:20.348
Oh, come on!

18:20.349 --> 18:22.809
Hey, I said I'm smart. I'm not perfect.

18:25.855 --> 18:27.480
Do it. Just do it.

18:30.276 --> 18:33.154
Uh, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yes.
Yes, this is right.

18:38.826 --> 18:40.160
Well, that was fun,

18:40.161 --> 18:41.453
but it didn't fill the whole episode.

18:41.454 --> 18:43.872
So, in the Pixar tradition
of killing time,

18:43.873 --> 18:45.832
here's a <i> Family Guy</i> short.

18:45.833 --> 18:47.959
And don't worry,
it won't be that creepy one

18:47.960 --> 18:50.046
where the Chinese mother eats her baby.

19:16.992 --> 19:18.740
What?

20:02.451 --> 20:04.744
Aah.

20:12.128 --> 20:14.379
All right.
