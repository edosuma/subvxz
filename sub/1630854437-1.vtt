08:54.602 --> 08:56.369
The future of Montana is today.

08:56.369 --> 08:59.039
The future of Montana
is a fifth generation rancher

08:59.039 --> 09:00.908
whose family moved here
six years

09:00.908 --> 09:03.210
before Montana became a state.

09:05.378 --> 09:07.781
It is fitting
that a founding member

09:07.781 --> 09:10.918
of this state a century later,
now leads it.

09:15.322 --> 09:17.958
And defending you in Washington
is another

09:17.958 --> 09:20.227
fifth generation rancher
who has served Montana

09:20.227 --> 09:21.629
in the house of representatives,

09:21.629 --> 09:23.463
and two terms as your governor.

09:26.233 --> 09:28.068
Allow me the honor
of introducing

09:28.068 --> 09:31.504
your next Governor John Dutton
and U.S. Senator Lynelle Perry.

09:54.762 --> 09:59.099
Well, the open bar
was my daughter's idea.

10:00.167 --> 10:02.335
I see it worked.

10:02.335 --> 10:04.204
We have a lot of work to do.

10:04.204 --> 10:07.040
And a lot of work to undo.

10:07.040 --> 10:09.142
The question we
all have to answer,

10:09.142 --> 10:12.612
the one that I will
look to every day is...

10:12.612 --> 10:15.816
what will Montana look
like in a hundred years?

10:15.816 --> 10:19.820
Much of that is dictated by
the way the world sees us today.

10:19.820 --> 10:24.024
Right now, we are seen as
the rich man's play thing.

10:24.024 --> 10:27.961
We are New York's novelty
and California's toy.

10:27.961 --> 10:30.597
Not anymore.

10:30.597 --> 10:33.366
You've elected me to be
a steward of this state,

10:33.366 --> 10:34.702
of its land,
and its people,

10:34.702 --> 10:36.670
and that's exactly
what I will be.

10:41.709 --> 10:45.779
You know, environmentalists,
they just love to debate

10:45.779 --> 10:50.150
what's Montana's most
valuable resource.

10:50.150 --> 10:53.320
Is it the water,
is it the wolves,

10:53.320 --> 10:54.722
is it trees?

10:54.722 --> 10:58.058
The answer is actually
pretty simple.

10:58.058 --> 10:59.626
It's you.

11:03.797 --> 11:08.201
The farmers and ranchers who
live with the land, not on it.

11:08.201 --> 11:10.237
Protecting you now
is how Montana

11:10.237 --> 11:12.439
still looks like Montana

11:12.439 --> 11:15.542
when none of us here tonight
are here to see it.

11:16.910 --> 11:18.746
Thank you.

11:26.119 --> 11:28.789
How do you follow that?
I don't know.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.758
Uh, ditto.

11:30.758 --> 11:33.894
The wars that Montana faces
here at home,

11:33.894 --> 11:36.296
those will be my wars
in Washington.

12:29.582 --> 12:32.953
Is this a good thing
or a bad thing?

12:32.953 --> 12:35.088
He'll kill the hotel.

12:35.088 --> 12:37.825
He'll kill the airport.

12:37.825 --> 12:40.460
It's a good thing
for the land...

12:40.460 --> 12:42.362
But I don't see
how it's good for us.

12:44.497 --> 12:45.866
Not yet anyway.

12:54.207 --> 12:56.176
That's it.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.484
Caroline.

13:04.484 --> 13:06.486
I told you to go
after the daughter.

13:06.486 --> 13:10.357
And now he's governor...
he will shut us down on day one.

13:10.357 --> 13:11.591
Caroline.

13:13.293 --> 13:14.427
Look at him.

13:17.264 --> 13:18.866
His father is the governor.

13:18.866 --> 13:20.968
He'll be next.

13:20.968 --> 13:25.005
Should be the happiest
day of his life.

13:25.005 --> 13:26.373
So why isn't he smiling?

13:31.111 --> 13:33.646

13:35.548 --> 13:36.649

13:38.151 --> 13:41.521

13:41.521 --> 13:45.692

these fucking hillbillies.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.619
You're really embracing
this low-man thing.

14:12.619 --> 14:14.721
I'm in no mood, Beth.

14:14.721 --> 14:17.390
Yeah, I wouldn't be either.

14:17.390 --> 14:19.592
They even let you
ride a horse yet?

14:19.592 --> 14:22.129
They let me ride the buck
out of the two year-olds,

14:22.129 --> 14:23.330
that's about it.

14:24.932 --> 14:28.435
Some day I'm gonna be top hand,
you watch.

14:28.435 --> 14:31.071
Wow, so much ambition.

14:31.071 --> 14:34.942
I mean, that's like dreaming of
running the grill at McDonald's.

14:34.942 --> 14:36.076
That's what it's like to you.

14:41.949 --> 14:43.183

14:43.183 --> 14:44.251

14:44.251 --> 14:46.086
I leave for college tomorrow.

14:46.086 --> 14:48.688
Gonna study finance.

14:48.688 --> 14:51.158
What's that?

14:51.158 --> 14:53.961
How to make money off
other people's money.

14:53.961 --> 14:55.195
Seems like quite the trick.

18:00.313 --> 18:03.683
Evening. Can I get
you something to drink?

18:03.683 --> 18:06.353
Vodka martini, three olives.

18:06.353 --> 18:07.854
You want a beer?

18:10.357 --> 18:11.358
Just water.

18:13.059 --> 18:14.060
You have I.D.?

18:16.696 --> 18:17.830
I have two.

18:22.535 --> 18:24.604
You like that martini dirty?

18:26.173 --> 18:27.307
What do you think?

18:30.009 --> 18:31.444
You got your
hands full, buddy.

18:35.215 --> 18:36.716
That bother you?

18:36.716 --> 18:38.318
Yeah.

18:38.318 --> 18:39.786
Why?

18:39.786 --> 18:41.488
You let him look at
you like--

18:41.488 --> 18:45.458
Like what,
like he wants to fuck me?

18:45.458 --> 18:47.794
You look at me that way.

18:47.794 --> 18:49.329
So does every man on earth
to every woman

18:49.329 --> 18:52.365
they find attractive,
and some they don't.

18:52.365 --> 18:55.535
I can be a victim of it,
or a beneficiary.

18:55.535 --> 18:58.305
I choose the latter.

18:58.305 --> 19:00.340
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

19:00.340 --> 19:02.442
Yeah, you do.

19:02.442 --> 19:05.312
You may be stronger than me,
but make no mistake--

19:05.312 --> 19:07.214
men are the weaker sex.

19:08.515 --> 19:09.549
You're doing it again.

19:09.549 --> 19:10.917
What am I doing?

19:10.917 --> 19:12.885
Saying shit
I don't understand.

19:12.885 --> 19:15.222
You understand it, you just
don't want it to be true.

19:15.222 --> 19:18.225
I don't want to
fight with you--

19:18.225 --> 19:19.859
Then stop acting like a pussy.

19:22.295 --> 19:23.863
I'm not yours
to be jealous over.

19:28.568 --> 19:30.102
This was a mistake.

19:30.237 --> 19:31.904
Looking that way.

19:31.904 --> 19:33.840
I think we should leave.

19:37.344 --> 19:39.679
You go.
I'll find my own way.

19:39.679 --> 19:42.749
I can't just leave you
here with no way home.

19:42.749 --> 19:44.484
Look, your options are
enjoy dinner or go.

19:44.484 --> 19:46.553
But deciding what I do is not
one of your choices.

19:49.589 --> 19:51.324
I'll thumb a ride.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.160
Where you going?

20:28.160 --> 20:30.530
Don't know.
Back to the ranch, I guess.

20:30.530 --> 20:32.732
Where's your ride?

20:32.732 --> 20:34.066
Ride's staying here.

20:36.202 --> 20:38.905
Listen, if she's bucking
that hard from the beginning,

20:38.905 --> 20:41.240
smartest thing you can do
is just jump off.

20:41.240 --> 20:43.343
You're gonna walk back?

20:43.343 --> 20:45.378
Ain't got much choice.

20:45.378 --> 20:47.079
Hell, come have
a beer with us.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.648
Ain't in the mood.

20:50.317 --> 20:53.520
All right. Take this truck
back to the ranch.

20:53.520 --> 20:55.154
We'll clown car
our way back.

20:55.154 --> 20:56.255
You sure?

20:56.255 --> 20:57.890
Ain't nuthin', pard.

20:57.890 --> 20:59.992
- See you back at the ranch.
- Thanks.

22:36.155 --> 22:37.289
You're up early.

22:39.291 --> 22:40.560
Yeah, big day.

22:42.294 --> 22:43.930
When's that getting started?

22:43.930 --> 22:46.966
Around five, I think.

22:46.966 --> 22:49.068
Is he going to be able
to stick around?

22:49.068 --> 22:51.804
I need him back
in Helena tomorrow so...

22:51.804 --> 22:54.140
We're calving, Beth.
When is he coming back?

22:54.140 --> 22:57.544
In four years.
Maybe eight.

23:03.650 --> 23:04.917
Okay.

23:04.917 --> 23:06.252
You want some coffee?

23:09.321 --> 23:10.657
I'm sorry.

23:11.658 --> 23:13.092
What did you do?

23:17.096 --> 23:18.731
Nothing recently, but...

23:19.999 --> 23:23.470
For what I did then, I'm sorry.

23:24.637 --> 23:27.073
When then, Beth?

23:27.073 --> 23:31.511
This is a sort of a...
blanket apology to

23:31.511 --> 23:34.847
generally, you know,
cover the past.

23:36.015 --> 23:37.717
- The past.
- Yeah.

23:37.717 --> 23:39.586
All right.

23:39.586 --> 23:42.555
Like everything
before right now.

23:42.555 --> 23:44.356
- That's what I'm sorry for.
- Mm.

23:45.858 --> 23:47.760
Honey...

23:47.760 --> 23:49.028
and I mean this with love,

23:49.028 --> 23:50.963
but it's way too early
for this shit.

23:50.963 --> 23:52.499
I was fucking awful to you.

23:55.034 --> 23:56.636
I was terrible, and I...

24:00.172 --> 24:04.176
If it is any consolation,
I was worse on myself.

24:04.176 --> 24:05.545
You know what
your problem is?

24:06.546 --> 24:09.381
It's this.

24:09.516 --> 24:11.951
It's almost as big as this.

24:11.951 --> 24:15.522
And I'm the only one
that knows that you have this,

24:15.522 --> 24:19.626
but you do, and baby,
it's big...

24:19.626 --> 24:24.330
But when this gets going and
then this gets going too...

24:24.330 --> 24:28.635
I robbed us of so much time
together, because I was...

24:35.407 --> 24:37.977
It's still robbing us.

24:37.977 --> 24:39.812
Whatever it took,
I don't need.

24:39.812 --> 24:41.380
I'm happy, Beth.

24:41.380 --> 24:42.682
With you.
With life. Everything's good.

24:42.682 --> 24:45.384
But we needed what it took.

24:47.554 --> 24:48.788
Come here.

24:51.558 --> 24:52.659
Baby...

24:56.563 --> 24:59.431
You need to find
somebody new to fight,

24:59.566 --> 25:02.569
or you're gonna
sit around this house

25:02.569 --> 25:04.571
and you're just gonna
beat the shit out of yourself.

25:06.906 --> 25:09.075
Okay?

25:12.645 --> 25:13.913
You did put me
through hell, though.

25:13.913 --> 25:15.014
Yeah.

25:20.252 --> 25:22.454
But you're all mine now
though, aren't you? Hm?

25:22.589 --> 25:24.691
Every last fucking
inch of me.

25:30.997 --> 25:32.498
You need to
let yourself be happy.

25:36.869 --> 25:38.671
That's the goal
for you today.

25:38.671 --> 25:41.708
I want you to find something
that makes you happy.

25:41.708 --> 25:43.509
Can you do that for me?

25:48.114 --> 25:50.516
Vodka makes me happy.

25:50.617 --> 25:52.518
Come on, now, I mean it.

25:55.688 --> 26:00.292
I promise. I will find
something that makes me happy.

26:02.428 --> 26:04.330
I love you.
See you in a bit.

26:23.115 --> 26:24.516
Jesus Christ.

26:27.153 --> 26:29.288
Can you believe this
fucking shit show?

26:29.288 --> 26:31.323
It's gonna be quite a party.

26:31.323 --> 26:34.260
The party ain't for us, Lloyd.
We got calves on the ground.

26:34.260 --> 26:36.495
Take that shit and go
around the other side.

26:38.330 --> 26:40.066
Listen up.

26:40.066 --> 26:44.270
You see a coyote prowling our
calves I want you to shoot it.

26:44.270 --> 26:46.305
You see a wolf prowling
one of our calves,

26:46.305 --> 26:47.707
I want you to shoot it.

26:47.707 --> 26:49.676
If you see a bear
let's try to haze him off.

26:49.676 --> 26:52.344
Now if he's on a carcass,
we call it in.

26:52.344 --> 26:54.013
Just take a picture with your
phones. Let's go to work.

26:56.983 --> 26:58.350
Why not shoot it?

26:58.350 --> 27:00.152
Take a picture
and run it off.

27:00.152 --> 27:02.889
You can't shoot a bear unless
he's chasing livestock.

27:02.889 --> 27:05.257
Makes no fucking sense.

27:34.754 --> 27:36.522
You know, politicians are
always talking

27:36.522 --> 27:38.725
about feeding the poor.

27:40.626 --> 27:43.395
That breakfast
buffet could do it.

27:43.395 --> 27:46.265
Mm-hmm.

27:46.265 --> 27:48.634
You know, in half an hour,
this entire room is going

27:48.735 --> 27:51.771
to be filled with your staff.
- Yeah.

27:51.771 --> 27:54.440
And they're going to eat and
they're going to discuss

27:54.440 --> 27:56.375
the issues of the day.

27:56.375 --> 27:58.110
And then they will scheme
and barter and bargain

27:58.110 --> 28:01.480
to decide which issues
deserve your attention.

28:01.480 --> 28:04.050
Yeah.

28:04.050 --> 28:06.152
You have no friends
in this building, John.

28:06.152 --> 28:07.787
You're going to need
to bring your own.

28:07.787 --> 28:10.389
And I could kill you for
putting me in this building

28:10.389 --> 28:12.759
with my bare hands, Lynelle.

28:12.759 --> 28:15.627
You offered.
I wanted your son.

28:16.763 --> 28:19.398
I could've controlled him,
you know.

28:19.398 --> 28:21.333
Now, I gotta deal with you.

28:21.333 --> 28:24.336
Well, I'm...
I'm pretty easy to bribe.

28:24.336 --> 28:25.838
Oh, I'm well aware.

28:25.838 --> 28:27.373
Every time I want
a bill pushed through

28:27.373 --> 28:29.075
I'm going to find myself
in a coat closet.

28:32.178 --> 28:34.280
It's going to be an
interesting four years.

28:35.782 --> 28:39.251
Four years is a long time.

28:39.251 --> 28:40.686
This is not where
I want to spend it.

28:45.124 --> 28:47.927
Are you going to run
again in 2026?

28:47.927 --> 28:50.062
Not on your life.

28:50.062 --> 28:53.099
All right. Think about
the power in that, John:

28:53.099 --> 28:55.835
a governor that doesn't care
about being re-elected.

28:55.835 --> 28:58.370
That doesn't have to make
friends with his enemies

28:58.370 --> 29:01.273
for some future compromise.

29:01.273 --> 29:04.176
You don't have
to compromise at all.

29:04.176 --> 29:07.613
You can build a legal wall
around this state.

29:07.613 --> 29:08.848
And maybe in the next
hundred years,

29:08.848 --> 29:10.416
this place looks the same.

29:13.619 --> 29:16.455
But in the meantime, you have
a friend in Washington.

29:16.455 --> 29:19.158
And you're gonna need one.

29:50.156 --> 29:51.891
Hold 'em up.
Hold 'em up.

30:05.004 --> 30:06.505
Shit.

30:06.505 --> 30:10.176
Move 'em! Move 'em! Move 'em!

31:24.283 --> 31:25.717
What do we do?

31:25.717 --> 31:28.520
Get across the river! You want
to go to jail in America?

31:54.413 --> 31:55.547
Get back!

31:58.884 --> 32:02.054
Hey! You're on the wrong side!

32:02.054 --> 32:04.523
Get back!

32:08.360 --> 32:10.129
On the other side, now.

32:10.129 --> 32:11.697
Get back.

32:56.608 --> 32:58.877
You rode on our side!

32:58.877 --> 33:00.446
Yeah.

33:00.446 --> 33:02.448
You have no authority
on this side.

33:05.151 --> 33:07.586
- Take care of him.
- Yep.

33:16.662 --> 33:18.730
Those horses
belong on this side.

33:18.730 --> 33:20.132
The thieves belong over here.

33:20.132 --> 33:22.568
They didn't make
it into Canada.

33:22.568 --> 33:24.536
They haven't committed
a crime on that side yet.

33:24.536 --> 33:26.572
Yeah, they didn't
commit this crime.

33:26.572 --> 33:28.674
They committed plenty others.

33:30.076 --> 33:31.710
We trade.

33:31.710 --> 33:35.881
They didn't look too worried
about Canadian prison.

33:35.881 --> 33:39.085
They seemed pretty worried
about ours, though.

33:39.085 --> 33:40.619
You want a feather in your cap

33:40.619 --> 33:42.254
or do you wanna see these
sons of bitches in prison

33:42.254 --> 33:43.622
for the next ten years?

33:50.396 --> 33:53.332
Sergeant,
bring the horses across.

34:25.764 --> 34:29.301
Great.
Now we gotta herd them up.

34:29.301 --> 34:32.504
It might be the wild west on
that side, but on this side

34:32.504 --> 34:34.540
rules are the foundation
of order,

34:34.540 --> 34:37.476
and order holds the flanks
of a civilized society.

34:37.476 --> 34:40.011
Yeah.
It's also how you herd sheep.

34:40.146 --> 34:42.148
You calling us sheep?

34:42.148 --> 34:43.382
I didn't call you nuthin'.

34:43.382 --> 34:45.151
You said it yourself.

35:31.330 --> 35:32.998
What a shit show.

35:37.669 --> 35:39.605
It's a show.
That's a fact.

35:41.207 --> 35:42.908
But it's our show now.

35:46.245 --> 35:50.048
What are you going
to do first?

35:50.048 --> 35:51.783
What do you think
I'm gonna do?

35:53.252 --> 35:54.420
They're ready, Dad.

35:59.725 --> 36:00.759
Here we go.

37:37.589 --> 37:39.358
Ladies and gentlemen,
please be seated.

37:45.964 --> 37:49.100
Mr. Dutton, face me and
raise your right hand.

37:54.673 --> 37:56.508
Place your
left hand on the Bible.

38:02.013 --> 38:03.915
I...
State your name...

38:09.521 --> 38:11.390
State your name.

38:24.736 --> 38:25.804
State your name.

38:26.805 --> 38:28.006
Daddy?

38:31.209 --> 38:33.512
I, John Dutton...

38:33.512 --> 38:36.214
- Do solemnly swear...
- Do solemnly swear...

38:36.214 --> 38:39.017
To uphold the Constitution
of the United States...

38:39.017 --> 38:41.720
To uphold the Constitution of
the United States...

38:41.720 --> 38:44.155
And the Constitution
of the State of Montana...

38:44.155 --> 38:46.024
And the Constitution of
the State of Montana...

38:46.024 --> 38:49.995
- Against all enemies...
- Against all enemies...

38:49.995 --> 38:52.631
- Foreign and domestic...
- Foreign and domestic.

38:52.631 --> 38:54.733
Congratulations.

38:56.735 --> 38:59.070
You had a chance
to be rid of him.

38:59.070 --> 39:02.508
You did nothing
and he grew stronger.

39:02.508 --> 39:06.044
It's slave rules for you now
and it's all your fault.

39:06.044 --> 39:07.879
I present to you
the 26th Governor

39:07.879 --> 39:11.216
of the great state
of Montana, John Dutton.

39:26.465 --> 39:29.601
Well, I am not a politician.

39:29.601 --> 39:32.103
This was never my plan.

39:32.103 --> 39:37.242
My only plan was to preserve
my family's way of life

39:37.242 --> 39:39.344
and the land
where they make it.

39:39.445 --> 39:42.448
The fact that
you're...

39:42.448 --> 39:43.615
The fact that
you're sitting here,

39:43.615 --> 39:45.183
the fact that you
voted for a man

39:45.183 --> 39:49.154
who does not want this job
to lead this state,

39:49.154 --> 39:51.122
means we share the same goals.

39:54.092 --> 39:56.662
My first act as Governor
will be to cancel funding

39:56.662 --> 39:59.130
for the Paradise Valley
airport project

39:59.130 --> 40:02.901
and the surrounding commercial
and housing developments.

40:02.901 --> 40:04.503
God isn't making any more land

40:04.503 --> 40:06.638
and he certainly isn't
filling any more rivers.

40:09.875 --> 40:14.480
Next I will propose to
the State Assembly

40:14.480 --> 40:17.348
to double property taxes
for non-residents.

40:20.251 --> 40:22.187
I will also add a
6 percent state sales tax

40:22.187 --> 40:26.424
to all goods sold
for non-residents.

40:28.059 --> 40:29.961
I will charge vehicle
registration fees

40:29.961 --> 40:31.997
to non-residents.

40:31.997 --> 40:36.735
The message is this:
we are not your playground,

40:36.735 --> 40:40.438
we are not your haven
from the pollution and traffic

40:40.438 --> 40:43.341
and mismanagement
of your home states.

40:43.341 --> 40:46.645
This is our home.

40:46.645 --> 40:49.414
Perhaps if you choose
to make Montana your home,

40:49.414 --> 40:51.883
you will start treating
it like a home

40:51.883 --> 40:55.286
and not a vacation rental.

40:57.355 --> 40:59.491
Thank you.

41:06.532 --> 41:07.966
Did you know about this?

41:07.966 --> 41:09.635
This is going to set
the state back thirty years.

41:09.635 --> 41:11.236
That's a pretty
good start, Jamie.

41:11.236 --> 41:13.438
The plan is set
it back a hundred.

41:13.539 --> 41:14.706
I'm not even sure he
has the authority.

41:14.706 --> 41:16.207
I'm not even sure it's legal.

41:16.207 --> 41:18.544
When did something being
legal bother you, Jamie? Hm?

41:18.544 --> 41:21.647
If it isn't legal you're going
to help him make it legal.

41:21.647 --> 41:23.348
You're gonna push
all this through.

41:23.348 --> 41:26.151
I'm about to work you
like a rented mule, brother.

41:26.151 --> 41:28.319
It's time for your
pound of flesh.

41:30.756 --> 41:32.558
- Can you get me out of here?
- Yeah, let's go.

41:55.046 --> 41:57.883
Want a whiskey, Daddy?

41:57.883 --> 41:59.050
Why not?

41:59.050 --> 42:00.586
Can I get one of those?

42:00.586 --> 42:01.587
Go fuck yourself.

42:04.089 --> 42:05.456
Make your brother a whiskey.

42:05.591 --> 42:08.827
I. Will. Not.

42:08.827 --> 42:11.763
Here. Here.

42:11.763 --> 42:13.364
Make me another one.

42:23.875 --> 42:25.711
Dad, you should think twice

42:25.711 --> 42:27.345
about canceling
the airport funding.

42:28.747 --> 42:31.316
Oh, shit, I've thought
plenty about it.

42:31.316 --> 42:33.251
It's five million
a year to the ranch.

42:33.251 --> 42:36.622
For a ranch that loses
three... Do the math.

42:36.622 --> 42:38.089
You know, there's other
revenue streams

42:38.089 --> 42:39.090
for the ranch, Jamie.

42:39.090 --> 42:40.458
Oh, name one.

42:40.458 --> 42:42.060
Well, I'm getting
a mil-five for the party.

42:42.060 --> 42:43.394
You're charging the State
a million dollars

42:43.394 --> 42:44.830
for his inauguration party.

42:44.830 --> 42:46.798
Actually,
I'm charging his campaign.

42:46.798 --> 42:48.399
Oh, is that it?
Well, that's worse, Beth.

42:48.399 --> 42:50.268
He can't benefit
from campaign funding,

42:50.268 --> 42:52.070
that's how he gets impeached
on his first day in office.

42:52.070 --> 42:54.105
He's not benefitting
from it, Jamie.

42:54.105 --> 42:56.441
A Utah LLC is
benefitting from it.

42:56.441 --> 42:57.909
We're all going to prison.

42:57.909 --> 42:59.444
You know, it is the eighth
wonder of the world

42:59.444 --> 43:00.746
you aren't already there.

43:00.746 --> 43:02.113
Will you two just
shut the fuck up

43:02.113 --> 43:04.249
and let me enjoy
the last hour of quiet

43:04.249 --> 43:06.818
I'm gonna experience in
the next four years?

43:12.123 --> 43:15.727
- This is all your fault.
- That's right.

43:15.727 --> 43:16.728
This was never
supposed to be me.

43:16.728 --> 43:18.263
It was supposed to be you.

43:18.263 --> 43:19.731
It could have been me.
It should've been me.

43:19.731 --> 43:20.732
No.

43:20.732 --> 43:21.967
I could've won.

43:21.967 --> 43:25.671
Oh, of that I have, uh,
I have no doubt.

43:25.671 --> 43:26.738
But then what?

43:31.910 --> 43:34.345
You know, it must break my
wife's heart to look down

43:34.345 --> 43:36.815
and see what a mess
I have made of this family.

43:41.086 --> 43:42.754
What an embarrassment
we are to the sacrifice

43:42.754 --> 43:44.455
it took to give us a home.

43:48.259 --> 43:51.529
But I tell you what...

43:51.529 --> 43:54.099
Sacrifice is exactly
what we are going to do.

43:55.834 --> 43:58.103
It's what you're
going to do, Jamie.

43:58.103 --> 44:01.773
You are going to sacrifice
your ambition.

44:01.773 --> 44:03.308
You are going to sacrifice
your fear,

44:03.308 --> 44:05.276
your weak,
self-loathing heart.

44:05.276 --> 44:07.312
You're going to kill all that
and you're going to get strong.

44:07.312 --> 44:10.481
And no matter how it scares
you or how much you disagree,

44:10.481 --> 44:12.283
you are going to do exactly
what the fuck I tell you

44:12.283 --> 44:14.452
for the next four years.

44:14.452 --> 44:15.787
Exactly.

44:18.456 --> 44:20.625
Make no mistake,
I love Montana,

44:20.726 --> 44:24.229
But I am doing this
for our ranch.

44:24.229 --> 44:25.864
We measure
every decision

44:25.864 --> 44:28.867
against what is good
for the ranch.

44:28.867 --> 44:31.569
The ranch comes first.
Do you understand me?

44:31.569 --> 44:32.938
I understand.

44:36.474 --> 44:37.876
Always, Daddy.

44:44.750 --> 44:47.753
What's said between us
stays between us.

44:47.753 --> 44:49.988
You understand?

44:49.988 --> 44:52.590
They sign confidentiality
agreements, Dad.

44:52.590 --> 44:55.093
I won't say a word, Governor.

44:55.093 --> 44:57.228
Except this--

44:57.228 --> 45:00.766
If I had your ranch,
I'd do the same thing.

45:06.004 --> 45:08.306
You make sure this is
my driver every time.

45:15.046 --> 45:17.515
♪ There was no one in this town
that would give me a ride ♪

45:20.285 --> 45:22.320
Hey, how dressy
is this, Dale?

45:22.320 --> 45:23.789
I don't know.

45:23.789 --> 45:24.923
It's a party for
the fucking Governor.

45:24.923 --> 45:27.993
So pretty dressy, I guess.

45:27.993 --> 45:30.095
But since you don't
have any dresses

45:30.095 --> 45:31.196
it doesn't really matter
how dressy it is.

45:31.196 --> 45:32.630
Screw you,
I got dresses.

45:32.630 --> 45:34.800
You have dresses?

45:34.800 --> 45:35.801
I've got dresses.

45:35.801 --> 45:37.302
You have dresses?

45:37.302 --> 45:38.937
Is there a fucking
echo in here?

45:38.937 --> 45:40.839
Hey Teeter,
Jake's got dresses too

45:40.839 --> 45:42.107
if you need to borrow one.

45:43.508 --> 45:44.810
That's a little
out of left field.

45:44.810 --> 45:46.611
What the hell
you messing with me for?

45:46.611 --> 45:49.147
I'd love to see the dress
that Jake could fit into.

45:49.147 --> 45:51.682
Be about the size of
a fucking bed sheet.

45:51.817 --> 45:53.819
What the hell are you
all on my ass for?

45:53.819 --> 45:56.154
Ah, hell, Jake, something
frilly might look good on you.

45:56.154 --> 45:57.823
You know?
A little lace in there.

45:57.823 --> 45:58.824
What the hell
are you laughing at?

45:58.824 --> 46:01.192
Hey.

46:01.192 --> 46:04.896
I don't need you all drunk,
this party ain't for you.

46:04.896 --> 46:09.300
Ethan, you want to tell
me what is so fucking funny?

46:09.300 --> 46:11.736
Jake's trying to pick
out his dress for tonight.

46:13.438 --> 46:14.639
His what?

46:14.639 --> 46:16.474
He wants to wear
a dress, sir.

46:16.474 --> 46:18.043
He wants to wear...

46:18.043 --> 46:20.045
Jake, hey, you got
a bet to settle,

46:20.045 --> 46:22.113
you settle it somewhere else.

46:22.113 --> 46:24.082
You put on a fucking dress

46:24.082 --> 46:25.650
and go to the
Governor's ball tonight

46:25.650 --> 46:27.152
I'm gonna hang you in it,
you understand me?

46:27.152 --> 46:28.619
You understand what
I fucking say?

46:28.619 --> 46:29.921
I ain't wearing
no damn dress.

46:29.921 --> 46:31.589
Just be... whoa, whoa.

46:31.589 --> 46:33.724
Just behave.

46:33.859 --> 46:35.393
And don't be an idiot.

46:35.393 --> 46:36.661
Now let's go,
put your show shirts on.

46:36.661 --> 46:38.864
Let's go.
Get your shit together.

46:38.864 --> 46:40.899
Go put your show dress on.

46:40.899 --> 46:42.067
Don't be an idiot, Jake.

46:42.067 --> 46:44.769

47:24.775 --> 47:26.444
Gosh damn, boys,
look at this.

47:26.444 --> 47:28.179
They ought to have
a party like this every year.

47:28.179 --> 47:31.082
Actually, Jake,
they throw it every four years

47:31.082 --> 47:32.583
when there's a new governor.

47:32.583 --> 47:35.186
Well, excuse me for not
studying government in college.

47:35.186 --> 47:37.122
The Diesel Academy
is not a college.

47:37.122 --> 47:39.024
The more you talk to him,
the more he talks back.

47:39.024 --> 47:40.791
Just in case you haven't
caught on to the pattern.

47:40.926 --> 47:43.028
They is on your ass tonight.

47:43.028 --> 47:44.262
He's being a prick.

47:44.262 --> 47:47.565
Look at this here, guys.

47:47.565 --> 47:51.369
Hey, can I get a double Buffalo
Trace on the rocks, please?

47:52.837 --> 47:53.939
How much do I owe you?

47:53.939 --> 47:55.974
It's an open bar, sir.

47:55.974 --> 47:58.076
Uh, could you make
another one of those?

47:58.076 --> 47:59.244
- Two.
- Three.

47:59.244 --> 48:00.778
- Four.
- Five, please.

48:00.778 --> 48:02.480
I get the picture.

48:02.480 --> 48:03.982
Hell, while you're making em.

48:03.982 --> 48:06.317
How bout I just make one for
anybody in a cowboy hat?

48:06.317 --> 48:08.386
That'll work.

48:08.386 --> 48:11.356
Hey, it's the Bar M boys.

48:11.356 --> 48:13.858
Hey, Stetson, what do ya know.
- I don't know it.

48:13.959 --> 48:15.526
I do know there's
a cowboy in the Capitol.

48:15.526 --> 48:17.228
Look at all this...

48:17.228 --> 48:19.530
It's gonna be hell
to clean up tomorrow, I bet.

48:19.530 --> 48:21.332
- Ryan.
- Stet.

48:21.332 --> 48:22.867
Hope they don't make us
sit in there and eat supper.

48:22.968 --> 48:24.202
I'll never
figure out them damn forks.

48:24.202 --> 48:26.171
Well, you know what?

48:26.171 --> 48:29.307
They can't make us do nothing
if they can't find us, huh?

48:29.307 --> 48:30.875
Come on, guys.

48:30.976 --> 48:32.510
Best news I've heard
all day.

48:44.155 --> 48:46.491
Hi.
Hi, how you been?

48:46.491 --> 48:47.993
Great to see you.

48:51.997 --> 48:56.001
Hi, thanks for coming.
I really appreciate it.

48:56.001 --> 48:57.202
Hi.

49:00.238 --> 49:01.439
More like
a wedding reception

49:01.439 --> 49:03.474
than your first night
in office, huh?

49:05.043 --> 49:06.644
My wedding reception
was in my living room

49:06.644 --> 49:09.014
with thirty people.

49:09.014 --> 49:12.683
This looks like
exactly what it is: work.

49:12.683 --> 49:14.685
Hi, so nice to see you.

49:14.685 --> 49:17.322
Congratulations.

49:17.322 --> 49:18.856
Well, this is more like a
wedding reception

49:18.856 --> 49:20.858
than you think, because
you are married to Montana

49:20.858 --> 49:22.260
for better or for worse.

49:22.260 --> 49:23.894
Yeah, so everyone
keeps telling me.

49:30.235 --> 49:33.038
All right, I'm gonna wander.

49:33.038 --> 49:35.606
Wait.
You're not gonna eat?

49:35.606 --> 49:38.709
In this dress?
Are you fucking kidding me?

49:38.709 --> 49:40.378
I'll see you later.

49:41.079 --> 49:42.313
Have a good night.

49:47.885 --> 49:50.388
You know, I took over running
this ranch from my father

49:50.388 --> 49:54.559
when I was...
34 years-old.

49:55.726 --> 49:57.062
For the next thirty years

49:57.062 --> 49:58.729
I never spent one night
away from this place

49:58.729 --> 50:01.466
until this year.

50:01.466 --> 50:06.671
First time
I've been here in a month.

50:06.671 --> 50:08.939
What's up,
everybody, we are
Shane Smith and the Saints

50:08.939 --> 50:10.641

50:10.641 --> 50:13.311

Mr. Dutton and your family.

50:13.311 --> 50:15.380
for having us
and congratulations.

51:50.408 --> 51:52.009
None of 'em are mine.

51:52.009 --> 51:54.479
I'm too smart
to date a cowboy.

51:54.479 --> 51:56.214
I like looking at em though.

51:57.882 --> 51:59.584
You're wearing an
orange jumpsuit

51:59.584 --> 52:02.320
with tassels, and you're
saying you're too smart?

52:03.388 --> 52:04.722
I sing later.

52:04.722 --> 52:06.924
Gotta wear something
flashy on stage.

52:06.924 --> 52:07.958
Something fun.

52:07.958 --> 52:09.093
Crowd likes it.

52:09.194 --> 52:10.761
Well, mission accomplished.

52:12.029 --> 52:13.598
Why no cowboys?

52:13.598 --> 52:15.933
'Cause they'll always
love the life more.

52:15.933 --> 52:17.568
And the horse more.

52:17.568 --> 52:18.736
And the job more.

52:18.736 --> 52:20.205
The rodeo more.

52:21.339 --> 52:23.274
I wanna be first.

52:23.274 --> 52:24.542
You do?

52:28.579 --> 52:30.881
I prefer a man whose
life is already full.

52:32.417 --> 52:34.018
That way he's got something
to share with me.

52:34.018 --> 52:35.686
You know what I mean?

52:35.686 --> 52:39.224
If I want blind adoration,
I'll get me a dog.

52:41.826 --> 52:43.228
I'm gonna go sit
with my cowboy now.

52:55.373 --> 52:56.941
Ain't gonna work.

52:56.941 --> 52:58.809
What ain't gonna work?

52:58.809 --> 53:00.811
I'm just window shopping.

53:00.811 --> 53:02.146
Oh.

53:02.247 --> 53:05.250
So no interest in a dance?

53:05.250 --> 53:06.684
None.

53:06.684 --> 53:07.952
You sure?

53:07.952 --> 53:09.654
I'm pretty sure.

53:11.155 --> 53:12.957
What if I insisted?

53:12.957 --> 53:14.825
How you plan on doing that?

53:18.663 --> 53:19.730
That was pretty slick.

53:22.800 --> 53:23.801
One dance.

53:25.069 --> 53:26.637

What are you doing
hiding up here?

54:15.152 --> 54:16.321
Just keeping
an eye on things.

54:16.321 --> 54:19.223
Making sure
everybody's behaving.

54:19.324 --> 54:21.892
Come on.
We can go have some fun.

54:21.892 --> 54:23.728
That party ain't
for me, Beth.

54:23.728 --> 54:24.895
Ain't for any of us.

54:24.895 --> 54:26.964
It is.
It's for everyone.

54:28.633 --> 54:30.901
You know what?

54:30.901 --> 54:33.904
I never think about
what happens a year from now

54:33.904 --> 54:36.407
or ten years from now.

54:36.407 --> 54:40.177
I always worried about today
with an eye on tomorrow.

54:40.177 --> 54:42.413
But when I look
down there, Beth,

54:42.413 --> 54:46.050
ten years worries me.

54:46.050 --> 54:48.519
He only became governor
so we don't have to worry

54:48.519 --> 54:50.087
about the next ten years.

54:50.087 --> 54:51.789
- Really?
- Yeah.

54:51.789 --> 54:53.924
Nobody else
could've done that?

54:53.924 --> 54:55.593
In this whole state. Nobody?

54:57.995 --> 55:00.264
That's what worries me.

55:02.266 --> 55:04.602
What was the, um...

55:04.602 --> 55:08.005
the name of Emperor
that played the fiddle

55:08.005 --> 55:09.474
when Rome was burning?

55:12.076 --> 55:13.077
Nero?

55:15.045 --> 55:16.847
This reminds me of that.

55:23.721 --> 55:25.089
He's gonna lose this place.

55:32.296 --> 55:36.200
Here.
I'm going to turn in.

55:41.071 --> 55:42.206
I love you.

55:59.490 --> 56:01.692
Yes, sir,
we got them wrangled.

56:01.692 --> 56:03.928
We're just sitting tight here.

56:03.928 --> 56:05.129
All night if we have to, sir.

56:06.831 --> 56:09.667
Okay, yes, sir.

56:09.667 --> 56:11.736
I've talked to
about half of the owners.

56:11.736 --> 56:13.471
They're sending out trucks.

56:13.471 --> 56:15.205
The rest we can just send
back to Billings,

56:15.205 --> 56:16.340
sort 'em out there.

56:16.441 --> 56:18.643
All right.
Let me talk to the wife.

56:33.323 --> 56:34.459
Okay.

56:40.565 --> 56:43.200
Hey. You coming home?

56:43.200 --> 56:44.535
Looks like we're going
to have to take these horses

56:44.535 --> 56:45.970
back to Billings.

56:45.970 --> 56:47.772
<i>Okay.</i>

56:47.772 --> 56:50.775
I'm thinking maybe
I should meet you there.

56:50.775 --> 56:52.376
The cramps are getting worse.

56:53.377 --> 56:55.379
That's three weeks early.

56:55.480 --> 56:57.848
They're really bad, Kayce.

56:57.848 --> 57:00.551
Shit... I'm leaving now.
You don't think you can wait?

57:00.551 --> 57:02.019
I don't think I should.

57:02.019 --> 57:03.554
Okay, well, I don't want
you giving birth

57:03.554 --> 57:05.490
on the side of the road.

57:05.490 --> 57:06.957
I'll send an ambulance south,
okay, to meet you on the road.

57:06.957 --> 57:09.527
- <i>Okay.</i>
- Okay.

57:11.862 --> 57:13.531
Tate!

57:13.531 --> 57:16.300
Hey, Hendon, I'm meeting
Monica at the hospital.

57:16.300 --> 57:18.068
Yeah, I'll handle this.
Go!

57:48.699 --> 57:50.267
You okay, Mom?

57:50.267 --> 57:51.536
Yeah, I'm okay.

57:51.536 --> 57:52.670
You sure?

58:18.563 --> 58:20.565
- Want me to drive, mama?
- You can't drive.

58:20.565 --> 58:21.766
I can drive better than this.

Haven't seen you in a while.

It's Carter.

59:54.692 --> 59:55.760
I know who you are.

59:58.863 --> 1:00:00.665
Jesus Christ,
it's been a while.

1:00:02.032 --> 1:00:04.969
You want me to saddle one?

1:00:04.969 --> 1:00:07.371
Wish I had the time,
but I don't.

1:00:08.806 --> 1:00:10.307
You're the Governor now.

1:00:10.307 --> 1:00:12.409
Yep.

1:00:12.409 --> 1:00:14.378
The big man.

1:00:14.378 --> 1:00:15.713
So they say.

1:00:18.015 --> 1:00:19.483
I miss our rides.

1:00:22.186 --> 1:00:23.821
Yeah, I miss 'em too.

1:00:23.821 --> 1:00:25.022
We'll do 'em again.

1:00:26.456 --> 1:00:27.825
Quit eating the fertilizer.

1:00:27.825 --> 1:00:29.293
Huh?

1:00:29.293 --> 1:00:30.627
Quit growing.

1:00:30.627 --> 1:00:31.996
Why?

1:00:31.996 --> 1:00:36.767
Because it...
Because it freaks me out.

1:00:36.767 --> 1:00:39.770
You're a living reminder of
how much time I don't have.

1:00:42.973 --> 1:00:45.309
If you grow a beard,
you're fired.

1:00:48.979 --> 1:00:50.748
No beards.
Got it.

1:00:59.690 --> 1:01:01.091
Take me to Helena.

1:01:01.091 --> 1:01:02.860
We need to go to Billings.

1:01:04.194 --> 1:01:05.830
Why, what's in Billings?

1:01:43.067 --> 1:01:44.634
I had a brother.

1:01:56.380 --> 1:01:57.982
For an hour, anyway.

1:02:00.250 --> 1:02:01.385
A brother, huh?

1:02:05.790 --> 1:02:06.791
John.

1:02:10.660 --> 1:02:11.896
John?

1:02:14.865 --> 1:02:16.166
They named him John.

1:03:09.086 --> 1:03:11.755
<i>Next time on an all-new
Yellowstone...</i>

1:03:11.856 --> 1:03:13.623
You could be
a really good leader, John,

1:03:13.623 --> 1:03:15.926
but if you don't play the game

1:03:15.926 --> 1:03:17.694
the game plays you.

1:03:17.694 --> 1:03:20.030
Hey, when he says jump,
you don't ask how high.

1:03:20.030 --> 1:03:21.365
You just start hoppin'.

1:03:21.365 --> 1:03:24.201
You are signing
a declaration of war.

1:03:24.201 --> 1:03:27.637
Market Equities
will not just go away.

1:03:27.637 --> 1:03:29.874
This will be a fight.

1:03:29.874 --> 1:03:31.108
A big one.

1:03:31.108 --> 1:03:33.510
You don't tell a soul.
This never happened.
