09:40.667 --> 09:42.669
Did I say anything
of interest?

09:42.712 --> 09:44.279
No, you talked rubbish.

09:44.322 --> 09:46.847
But you're not sleeping.

09:46.890 --> 09:48.413
Bad dreams?

09:48.457 --> 09:51.503
The dreams are lovely.

09:51.547 --> 09:54.550
It's the waking up
that I'm beginning to resent.

09:54.594 --> 09:56.247
Ah, no melancholy.

09:56.291 --> 09:57.640

Now, go and get

10:00.164 --> 10:03.820

I am beginning to regret

10:03.864 --> 10:07.258
that I ever allowed myself
to be talked into doing this.

10:12.350 --> 10:15.223
He won't take
breakfast from me.

10:15.266 --> 10:16.354
Old dogs.

10:16.398 --> 10:17.878
Which one?

10:17.921 --> 10:19.401
Mm.

10:21.403 --> 10:22.534

10:27.627 --> 10:31.718
Oh, are you doing an
interview as well, Zhaban?

10:31.761 --> 10:34.851
You know, sometimes
you talk to me

10:34.895 --> 10:37.767
as if I were a
benign old codger.

10:37.811 --> 10:39.334
"Codger"?

10:39.377 --> 10:41.684
Somewhere between a coot
and geezer, I believe.

10:41.728 --> 10:43.904
Ooh, the first one just arrived.

10:43.947 --> 10:45.296
Go and get dressed,
Your Highness.

10:45.340 --> 10:47.777
And don't forget
to wash your hands.

10:47.821 --> 10:49.736
Ten years,
still have to remind you.

10:57.831 --> 11:00.311
Yeah. That's the one.Yeah. I like that.

11:04.141 --> 11:06.056
Extremely dignified, sir.

11:06.100 --> 11:08.276
Look at this knot.
It's ridiculous.

11:08.319 --> 11:09.451
Well, maybe.

11:09.494 --> 11:10.844
But I want to keep my job.

11:10.887 --> 11:12.236
I know you're
nervous.

11:12.280 --> 11:14.891
I am not nervous.

11:14.935 --> 11:16.719
The past is the past.

11:16.763 --> 11:18.590
Now.

11:18.634 --> 11:20.810
Much better.Huh.

11:20.854 --> 11:22.159
Yeah.

11:24.640 --> 11:26.468
Oh, the drama.

11:26.511 --> 11:28.035
You went over the terms
with them?

11:28.078 --> 11:29.297
Three times, sir.

11:29.340 --> 11:30.907
She assured me
she will not inquire

11:30.951 --> 11:32.779
about your separation
from Starfleet.

11:32.822 --> 11:35.216
: Yeah.After so long,

11:35.259 --> 11:38.741
sometimes I worry you've
forgotten what you did,

11:38.785 --> 11:40.395
who you are.

11:40.438 --> 11:43.964
Laris, I... We...have not.

11:48.664 --> 11:50.231
Now go.

11:50.274 --> 11:52.059
And, sir?

11:52.102 --> 11:54.148
Be the captain they remember.

11:59.544 --> 12:01.764
RICHTER:
While Captain of Starfleet's
FlagshipEnterprise,

12:01.808 --> 12:03.505
he was hailed
as one of our galaxy's

12:03.548 --> 12:05.202
most intrepid explorers,

12:05.246 --> 12:06.813
a skilled diplomat,

12:06.856 --> 12:08.815
military strategist,

12:08.858 --> 12:10.991
humanitarian and author

12:11.034 --> 12:13.820
of many widely-praised works
of historical analysis.

12:13.863 --> 12:16.910
He joins us on the anniversary
of the Romulan supernova

12:16.953 --> 12:19.521
to discuss his role
in those tragic events.

12:19.564 --> 12:21.436
I have the rare honor
of introducing

12:21.479 --> 12:23.612
Admiral Jean-Luc Picard.

12:23.655 --> 12:25.396
Retired.You've never agreed

12:25.440 --> 12:26.963
to an interview before,
so thank you

12:27.007 --> 12:28.530
for inviting the galaxy
into your study.

12:28.573 --> 12:31.098
Oh, less crowded
than I thought.

12:31.141 --> 12:34.971
Well... today is a solemn day.

12:35.015 --> 12:37.974
It is a day of memories.

12:38.018 --> 12:40.020
Raising awareness

12:40.063 --> 12:41.935
of the supernova's
lingering impact

12:41.978 --> 12:45.895
is work that I am
extremely passionate about.

12:45.939 --> 12:47.549
Let's explore that.

12:47.592 --> 12:48.768
When you first learned that

12:48.811 --> 12:50.160
the Romulan sun
was going to explode

12:50.204 --> 12:52.815
and the terrible consequences
that would bring,

12:52.859 --> 12:54.991
what feelings came up for you?

12:55.035 --> 12:59.822
Oh, well, there are no words
to describe the...

12:59.866 --> 13:02.564
calamitous scale of that change.

13:02.607 --> 13:04.044
Which is one of the reasons...

13:04.087 --> 13:06.046
You can't tell us how you felt,

13:06.089 --> 13:07.482
but your
initial actions were

13:07.525 --> 13:09.571
to call for a massive relocation
of Romulans?

13:09.614 --> 13:12.835
Well, the Romulans asked
for our help,

13:12.879 --> 13:15.142
and I believed we had a
profound obligation to give it.

13:15.185 --> 13:17.666
RICHTER: Many felt there were
better uses for our resources

13:17.709 --> 13:20.016
than aiding
the Federation's oldest enemy.

13:20.060 --> 13:22.062
Well, fortunately,
the Federation chose

13:22.105 --> 13:24.020
to support the rescue effort.

13:24.064 --> 13:26.849
Yes. Initially.

13:28.024 --> 13:29.983
I have been known
to be persuasive.

13:30.026 --> 13:32.072
But the Federation
understood

13:32.115 --> 13:34.726
there were millions
of lives at stake.

13:34.770 --> 13:35.727
Romulan lives.

13:35.771 --> 13:38.905
No. Lives.

13:38.948 --> 13:41.951
You left the Enterprise
to command the rescue armada.

13:41.995 --> 13:44.475
10,000 warp-capable ferries.

13:44.519 --> 13:48.305
A mission to relocate
900 million Romulan citizens

13:48.349 --> 13:50.873
to worlds outside
the blast of the supernova.

13:50.917 --> 13:53.833
A logistical feat more ambitious
than the pyramids.

13:53.876 --> 13:57.184
The pyramids were a symbol
of colossal vanity.

13:57.227 --> 14:00.840
If you want to look for
a historical analogy:

14:00.883 --> 14:02.754
Dunkirk.

14:02.798 --> 14:05.105
Dunkirk.

14:06.889 --> 14:08.456
Yes.

14:08.499 --> 14:09.718
And then

14:09.761 --> 14:10.980
the unimaginable happened.

14:11.024 --> 14:12.503
Can you tell us about that?

14:19.946 --> 14:21.512
Admiral?

14:21.556 --> 14:24.733
I thought we were here to
talk about the supernova.

14:24.776 --> 14:26.996
A group of rogue synthetics
dropped the planetary

14:27.040 --> 14:29.259
defense shields and hacked
Mars's own defense net.

14:29.303 --> 14:32.001
Yes.Wiping out
the rescue armada

14:32.045 --> 14:34.438
and completely destroying
the Utopia Planitia Shipyard.

14:34.482 --> 14:36.179
The explosions ignited
the flammable vapors

14:36.223 --> 14:37.702
in the stratosphere.

14:37.746 --> 14:39.530
Mars remains on fire
to this day.

14:39.574 --> 14:42.969
92,143 lives were lost,

14:43.012 --> 14:44.884
which led
to a ban on synthetics.

14:44.927 --> 14:47.190
Yes.

14:47.234 --> 14:50.237
We still don't know why
the synthetics went rogue

14:50.280 --> 14:52.108
and did what they did that day,

14:52.152 --> 14:54.241
but I believe

14:54.284 --> 14:55.938
the subsequent decision

14:55.982 --> 14:59.768
to ban synthetic life-forms
was a mistake.

14:59.811 --> 15:02.510
Lieutenant Commander Data,

15:02.553 --> 15:06.079
operations officer on
the Enterprise,was synthetic.

15:06.122 --> 15:08.646
Did you ever lose faith in him?

15:12.259 --> 15:14.174
Never.

15:14.217 --> 15:17.612
What was it
that you lost faith in, Admiral?

15:17.655 --> 15:21.746
You've never spoken about
your departure from Starfleet.

15:21.790 --> 15:26.360
Didn't you, in fact, resign
your commission in protest?

15:26.403 --> 15:28.362
Tell us, Admiral.

15:28.405 --> 15:31.060
Why did you really
quit Starfleet?

15:32.061 --> 15:33.845
Because it was no longer
Starfleet.

15:33.889 --> 15:35.108
I'm sorry?

15:35.151 --> 15:38.198
Because it was no longer
Starfleet!

15:40.069 --> 15:42.593
We withdrew.

15:42.637 --> 15:46.206
The galaxy was mourning,
burying its dead,

15:46.249 --> 15:49.426
and Starfleet had slunk
from its duties.

15:49.470 --> 15:51.776
The decision to call
off the rescue

15:51.820 --> 15:54.823
and to abandon those people
we had sworn to save

15:54.866 --> 15:57.130
was not just dishonorable.

15:57.173 --> 15:59.567
It was downright criminal!

15:59.610 --> 16:03.179
And I was not prepared
to stand by and be a spectator.

16:03.223 --> 16:08.576
And you, my dear, you have
no idea what Dunkirk is, right?

16:08.619 --> 16:13.276
You're a stranger to history.
You're a stranger to war.

16:13.320 --> 16:17.106
You just wave your hand and
it all goes away.

16:17.150 --> 16:20.370
Well, it's not so easy
for those who died.

16:20.414 --> 16:24.722
And it was not so easy
for those who were left behind.

16:24.766 --> 16:26.768
We're done here.

16:51.488 --> 16:55.101
"There's no legacy
as rich as honesty."

16:57.146 --> 16:59.018
Who said that, Number One?

17:16.861 --> 17:19.473
What do you want here?

17:19.516 --> 17:21.779
I saw your interview.

17:21.823 --> 17:23.694
Do you know me?

17:23.738 --> 17:24.826
What?

17:24.869 --> 17:26.610
Do you know me?

17:26.654 --> 17:27.959
No.

17:28.003 --> 17:29.526
Look at me.

17:36.185 --> 17:38.057
You're not sure.

17:40.189 --> 17:41.625
You're not sure.

17:42.974 --> 17:44.280
How do I know that?

17:44.324 --> 17:46.021
Who are you?

17:46.065 --> 17:48.067
I was with my boyfriend.

17:49.329 --> 17:51.635
We were in my apartment.

17:51.679 --> 17:54.160
They put a bag over my head.
I couldn't see anything.

17:54.203 --> 17:55.509
Who are "they"?

17:55.552 --> 17:58.120
I don't know, but
my boyfriend...

17:59.165 --> 18:00.818
They murdered him.

18:02.211 --> 18:04.257
Then I killed them.

18:05.606 --> 18:07.303
All of them.

18:07.347 --> 18:09.044
What?

18:09.088 --> 18:10.828
Something inside of me
just knew what to do,

18:10.872 --> 18:13.048
how to move, how to fight.

18:13.092 --> 18:15.181
And somehow...

18:17.183 --> 18:19.968
It was like lightning...

18:20.011 --> 18:21.970
seeking the ground.

18:22.013 --> 18:24.190
And then I took
the bag off.

18:24.233 --> 18:27.149
There was so much blood,
so I just ran.

18:27.193 --> 18:29.064
Shh.I didn't know where to go.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.110
Shh.

18:31.153 --> 18:34.243
Please, try and calm yourself.

18:34.287 --> 18:36.245
Shh.

18:36.289 --> 18:38.247
Try and calm yourself, okay?

18:40.249 --> 18:42.947
But in my mind,
I kept seeing you.

18:44.949 --> 18:47.126
I kept seeing your face.

18:47.169 --> 18:48.692
Me?

18:48.736 --> 18:50.694
Yes.

18:50.738 --> 18:53.088
I came because
the same lightning

18:53.132 --> 18:57.179
that got me out of there
alive led me here.

18:57.223 --> 18:59.181
Why?

18:59.225 --> 19:03.620
Because everything inside of me
says that I'm safe with you.

19:14.631 --> 19:16.329
There you go.

19:16.372 --> 19:17.634
Good as new.

19:17.678 --> 19:19.636
Thank you.

19:19.680 --> 19:21.334
ZHABAN:
Here you are.

19:23.466 --> 19:26.643
Earl Grey.
Never fails.

19:26.687 --> 19:28.079
LARIS:
We'll be in the kitchen.

19:36.523 --> 19:39.395
That's an
unusual necklace.

19:39.439 --> 19:41.484
May I see?

19:49.231 --> 19:51.233
Thank you.

19:51.277 --> 19:52.800
My father gave it to me.

19:52.843 --> 19:54.715
Hmm. Lovely.

19:56.412 --> 19:58.414
Have you ever...?

19:59.415 --> 20:01.765
Ever what?

20:02.766 --> 20:04.855
Been a stranger to yourself?

20:05.900 --> 20:07.684
Many, many times.

20:10.296 --> 20:12.298
Thank you.

20:15.649 --> 20:17.738
May I ask your name?

20:19.218 --> 20:20.480
Dahj.

20:20.523 --> 20:22.090
Dahj.

20:22.133 --> 20:23.700
I'm Jean-Luc.

20:23.744 --> 20:25.354
I know.

20:25.398 --> 20:27.443
And not because
of the interview

20:27.487 --> 20:30.707
or because
you're the great man.

20:32.709 --> 20:34.363
I know you.

20:34.407 --> 20:36.974
Well, I've
spoken, lectured.

20:37.018 --> 20:38.324
No, it's...

20:38.367 --> 20:40.674
It's older.

20:40.717 --> 20:42.110
Deeper.

20:42.153 --> 20:44.286
Much, much deeper.

20:48.334 --> 20:50.292
You may be right.

20:50.336 --> 20:52.729
Do you know how?

20:52.773 --> 20:55.384
No.

20:58.735 --> 21:00.694
Do you think I'm crazy?

21:00.737 --> 21:02.913
No.

21:02.957 --> 21:05.176
Do you believe me?

21:05.220 --> 21:06.787
I believe that

21:06.830 --> 21:10.660
you believe that you're
supposed to be here.

21:12.314 --> 21:15.274
And if you were
dangerous,

21:15.317 --> 21:18.364
then Number One
would let me know.

21:24.283 --> 21:25.284
Laris.

21:27.460 --> 21:30.245
Could you show our
guest to a room?

21:30.289 --> 21:33.422
I think she needs a
good night's sleep.

21:33.466 --> 21:35.337
Come on, dear.
We'll get you set up.

21:43.389 --> 21:45.173
Thank you.

23:02.859 --> 23:04.992
Would you like
to finish it, Captain?

23:14.828 --> 23:17.047
I don't know how.

23:17.091 --> 23:19.398
That is not true, sir.

23:41.985 --> 23:43.944
No.

23:43.987 --> 23:47.774
Excuse me, sir.
The young woman has gone.

23:47.817 --> 23:49.384
Where?

23:49.428 --> 23:50.994
I was up at 5:00.
Her door was open.

23:51.038 --> 23:53.257
The dog was in her bed,
but she was gone.

23:53.301 --> 23:55.390
I-I checked the feeds.

23:55.434 --> 23:56.870
She's nowhere on the property.

23:56.913 --> 23:58.262
There is somewhere I have to go.

23:58.306 --> 24:01.265
If she returns,
contact me immediately.

24:15.715 --> 24:17.238
Everything in
the quantum archive

24:17.281 --> 24:19.022
is locked in stasis,
correct?

24:19.066 --> 24:20.284
Correct.

24:20.328 --> 24:23.070
And no one beside myself
has access, correct?

24:23.113 --> 24:25.072
Unless you prefer
we sell tickets.

24:25.115 --> 24:27.553
Is that humor?We're trying something new.

24:27.596 --> 24:29.772
Don't give up
your day job.

24:29.816 --> 24:32.383
My program offers you
privacy beyond this point.

24:32.427 --> 24:34.429
If you need me again,
just say "Index."

25:36.099 --> 25:38.014
Index.

25:38.058 --> 25:40.060
Identify this painting.

25:41.322 --> 25:43.585
Item 227.67.

25:43.629 --> 25:47.633
Archives of Jean-Luc Picard,
admiral, retired.

25:47.676 --> 25:53.160
An oil on canvas painted
by Commander Data circa 2369.

25:53.203 --> 25:55.641
One of a set of two.

25:55.684 --> 25:58.252
He gifted it to you
on the Enterprise.

25:58.295 --> 26:02.125
The other is hanging on your
study wall at home, I believe.

26:02.169 --> 26:04.127
And no one else
has been in here?

26:04.171 --> 26:06.173
Not even for servicing?

26:06.216 --> 26:07.740
Check the records.

26:10.003 --> 26:11.961
No one, Admiral.

26:12.005 --> 26:14.268
This painting had a title.

26:14.311 --> 26:15.835
Accessing.

26:17.880 --> 26:21.841
This painting
is called Daughter.

26:52.001 --> 26:53.263
Hi, honey.

26:53.307 --> 26:54.438
Mom, someone tried to kill me.

26:54.482 --> 26:56.484
What? Honey, wh-who? Wha...

26:56.527 --> 26:58.312
I'm...

26:58.355 --> 27:00.923
I just ran.
I think they're still after me.

27:00.967 --> 27:02.533
I don't know
what's happening, Mom.

27:02.577 --> 27:03.970
Dahj, you need
to get somewhere safe.

27:04.013 --> 27:06.537
Mom, I tried,
but-but I couldn't stay there.

27:06.581 --> 27:09.497
I-I can't put
anyone else in danger.

27:09.540 --> 27:12.892
I don't want anyone else
to get hurt, Mom.

27:12.935 --> 27:14.894
Mom, I'm so scared.

27:14.937 --> 27:17.374
Honey, this is important.

27:17.418 --> 27:19.376
You have to go back to Picard.

27:19.420 --> 27:22.292
No, no, it's too dangerous
for him. It...

27:22.336 --> 27:23.772
Wait.

27:23.816 --> 27:27.820
Wait, I-I didn't tell you
that I went to Picard.

27:29.082 --> 27:31.258
Of course you did, sweetie.

27:31.301 --> 27:32.825
How else would I know?

27:32.868 --> 27:35.392
Mom, I haven't spoken to you
since it happened.

27:35.436 --> 27:36.655
What's happening?

27:36.698 --> 27:37.873
Baby, please.

27:37.917 --> 27:40.833
Find Picard. He can help you.

27:40.876 --> 27:42.399
He will help you.

27:42.443 --> 27:45.489
Just close your eyes and focus.

27:47.230 --> 27:48.797
Think clearly, Dahj.

27:48.841 --> 27:50.407
Clearly, Dahj.

27:50.451 --> 27:54.585
Now find Picard again.

27:54.629 --> 27:55.195
Go.

28:23.702 --> 28:26.095
Dahj?

28:26.139 --> 28:29.098
How did you know I was here?

28:29.142 --> 28:31.318
I was so very worried
when I found you'd gone.

28:31.361 --> 28:32.580
I was afraid
that they would come,

28:32.623 --> 28:34.103
that you would be in danger.

28:34.147 --> 28:37.454
I knew how to track you here.
I-I know stuff now.

28:37.498 --> 28:39.761
I can hear conversations
a block away.

28:39.805 --> 28:41.371
Come. Let's get
away from here.

28:41.415 --> 28:43.852
So I did some research.
I may have schizophrenia.

28:43.896 --> 28:46.550
Or maybe I had head trauma.
The auditory hallucinations...

28:46.594 --> 28:48.335
No, you don't have
schizophrenia.

28:48.378 --> 28:50.641
Then I'm a freak.No, you're not.

28:50.685 --> 28:54.080
In fact, you might
be very special.

28:55.864 --> 28:58.780
I had a dear friend.

28:58.824 --> 29:00.782
Commander Data.

29:00.826 --> 29:02.784
He was an android.

29:02.828 --> 29:04.046
Like the ones who
attacked Mars?

29:04.090 --> 29:06.962
No, no. Not at all.
The word "android"

29:07.006 --> 29:09.748
conjures up all kinds
of things for people.

29:09.791 --> 29:11.271
Forget them.

29:11.314 --> 29:16.058
Commander Data was a highly
decorated Starfleet officer.

29:16.102 --> 29:17.364
And...

29:18.931 --> 29:22.543
...he sacrificed
his life for me.

29:22.586 --> 29:25.894
On our last mission
together.

29:25.938 --> 29:29.550
It was over two decades ago now.

29:30.986 --> 29:33.597
But he was also
an artist.

29:33.641 --> 29:34.860
A painter.

29:34.903 --> 29:36.122
Why are you
telling me this?

29:36.165 --> 29:38.385
Because, Dahj,

29:38.428 --> 29:40.126
he painted you.

29:40.169 --> 29:43.477
Exactly as you are
here and now.

29:43.520 --> 29:46.175
But he painted it 30 years ago.

29:47.307 --> 29:49.265
That's impossible.

29:49.309 --> 29:53.008
He named the painting
"Daughter."

29:54.880 --> 29:58.057
Okay, look, your friend
painted someone,

29:58.100 --> 29:59.885
but...You said it was

29:59.928 --> 30:03.149
like lightning seeking
the ground, in your apartment.

30:03.192 --> 30:04.759
You knew what to do
even though

30:04.803 --> 30:06.543
you'd never
done it before.
Adrenaline.

30:06.587 --> 30:08.545
And you knew they were
coming after you.

30:08.589 --> 30:10.069
And the hearing.

30:10.112 --> 30:12.636
And y-you tracked me.

30:12.680 --> 30:15.509
How did you track me?
Tracking me requires...I just...

30:15.552 --> 30:17.816
...a security clearance,
which you don't have.

30:17.859 --> 30:20.731
I think
the attack on you

30:20.775 --> 30:24.213
might have acted
as some kind of wake-up call.

30:24.257 --> 30:26.520
Like a positronic
alarm bell.

30:26.563 --> 30:28.522
No.

30:28.565 --> 30:30.306
No, I was born in Seattle.

30:30.350 --> 30:33.222
My dad was a
xenobotanist.

30:33.266 --> 30:35.137
And our house was
full of orchids.

30:35.181 --> 30:38.140
He spliced two genuses and
he named the offspring after me.

30:38.184 --> 30:40.142
Orchidaceae Dahj oncidium.

30:40.186 --> 30:41.404
Yellow and pink.

30:41.448 --> 30:43.929
That's a beautiful memory.

30:43.972 --> 30:46.322
And it's yours.

30:46.366 --> 30:49.151
No one can touch it
or take it away.

30:50.239 --> 30:51.501
But...

30:53.112 --> 30:56.593
...you must
look inside,

30:56.637 --> 30:59.118
deeply and honestly.

30:59.161 --> 31:01.990
Have you ever considered
the possibility...

31:02.034 --> 31:04.079
That I'm a soulless
murder machine?

31:04.123 --> 31:08.562
That you are something lovingly
and deliberately created.

31:08.605 --> 31:10.085
Like Dahj oncidium.

31:10.129 --> 31:12.653
You're telling me
that I'm not real.

31:12.696 --> 31:13.915
No, I'm not.

31:13.959 --> 31:17.092
If you are
who I think you are...

31:18.789 --> 31:24.186
...you are dear to me in ways
that you can't understand.

31:24.230 --> 31:25.971
I will never leave you.

31:26.014 --> 31:31.454
We will go together to the
Daystrom Institute in Okinawa.

31:31.498 --> 31:35.589
I was just accepted at Daystrom
as a research fellow.

31:35.632 --> 31:38.331
You were? That's brilliant.

31:38.374 --> 31:40.115
That doesn't mean
anything anymore.

31:40.159 --> 31:42.161
If I'm right,

31:42.204 --> 31:45.251
it means that you are
the daughter of a man

31:45.294 --> 31:50.343
who was all meaning,
all courage.

31:52.084 --> 31:54.260
Be like him.

31:55.652 --> 31:57.350
They found us. Move, now.Oh.

31:58.786 --> 32:00.831
Dahj, wait.
We need help.

32:00.875 --> 32:02.355
They're almost here.

32:07.186 --> 32:09.231
Dahj, stop. Wait.

32:09.275 --> 32:11.277
No, there's no time.Oh.

32:20.764 --> 32:22.418
Stay down!

33:37.102 --> 33:38.103
No!

33:52.030 --> 33:54.554
DATA :
Would you like
to finish it, Captain?

33:54.597 --> 33:56.077
PICARD:
I will never leave you.

33:56.121 --> 33:58.645
RICHTER:
Why did you really quit
Starfleet?

33:58.688 --> 34:01.169
INDEX:
This painting
is calledDaughter.

34:01.213 --> 34:02.997
He's awake.

34:09.656 --> 34:11.745
I'm all right, boy.

34:13.747 --> 34:15.575
Aren't I?

34:15.618 --> 34:16.750
You took a bad knock.

34:16.793 --> 34:19.492
Otherwise, you are
apparently the same.

34:19.535 --> 34:20.841
You gave us a fright.

34:20.884 --> 34:22.625
Huh.

34:22.669 --> 34:24.192
What happened, Admiral?

34:25.237 --> 34:28.457
Dahj.

34:28.501 --> 34:30.068
She's dead.

34:34.420 --> 34:35.986
How is that possible?

34:36.030 --> 34:37.379
The police didn't mention her.

34:37.423 --> 34:39.512
They said
you were alone

34:39.555 --> 34:41.209
when they found you on the roof.

34:41.253 --> 34:43.820
They said there was no one else
on the security feed but you.

34:43.864 --> 34:45.213
That you were running...

34:45.257 --> 34:46.780
She could've had
a cloaking device

34:46.823 --> 34:49.174
and that's why we didn't
see her on the property feeds.

34:49.217 --> 34:52.481
Yeah, maybe it activated
automatically...

34:53.787 --> 34:56.006
...when she was in danger.Sir?

34:56.050 --> 34:58.096
She was a synthetic.

34:58.139 --> 35:00.315
The assassins
were Romulan.

35:00.359 --> 35:05.015
Oh, she came here
to find safety.

35:05.059 --> 35:07.148
Like you and Zhaban.

35:07.192 --> 35:10.151
Like me.

35:10.195 --> 35:13.807
She deserved better from me.

35:13.850 --> 35:18.203
I owe it to her to find out
who killed her and why.

35:18.246 --> 35:20.553
You ask too much of yourself.Oh.

35:20.596 --> 35:26.036
Sitting here, all these years,

35:26.080 --> 35:29.779
nursing my offended dignity,

35:29.823 --> 35:34.828
writing books of history
people prefer to forget.

35:34.871 --> 35:37.570
I never asked

35:37.613 --> 35:39.572
anything of myself

35:39.615 --> 35:41.139
at all.No, Admiral.

35:41.182 --> 35:43.967
I haven't been living.

35:44.011 --> 35:46.013
I've been waiting to die.

35:58.982 --> 36:01.420
JURATI:
Admiral Picard.

36:01.463 --> 36:02.769
It's an honor.

36:02.812 --> 36:05.206
Dr. Jurati. Thank you
for giving me the time.

36:05.250 --> 36:07.904
Oh, Agnes.
H-How can I help you?

36:07.948 --> 36:09.863
You can tell me
if it is possible to make

36:09.906 --> 36:12.692
a sentient android
out of flesh and blood.

36:18.132 --> 36:20.743
No, really. How can I...

36:22.005 --> 36:23.268
Is that why
you've come here?

36:23.311 --> 36:24.834
It is.

36:26.314 --> 36:30.362
Even before the ban,
that was... well, uh....

36:31.885 --> 36:33.843
W-Well,
a flesh-and-blood android

36:33.887 --> 36:36.890
was in our sights,
but a sentient one?

36:36.933 --> 36:39.022
Not for a thousand years.

36:39.066 --> 36:40.850
That makes it even more curious

36:40.894 --> 36:43.505
that recently
I had tea with one.

36:44.898 --> 36:46.769
JURATI:
It was the Grand Slam.

36:46.813 --> 36:50.904
Uh, sentient synthetics that
appear human inside and out.

36:50.947 --> 36:53.559
Feels like a lifetime ago now.

36:58.651 --> 37:01.001
Welcome to what's left
of the Federation's

37:01.044 --> 37:03.308
Division of Advanced
Synthetic Research.

37:03.351 --> 37:05.788
It's a ghost town.

37:05.832 --> 37:08.226
In more ways than one.

37:08.269 --> 37:12.665
The androids that destroyed Mars
came from this lab.

37:12.708 --> 37:16.451
Now we're only allowed
to operate theoretically.

37:16.495 --> 37:20.063
Study, publish,
run simulations.

37:20.107 --> 37:21.935
But you can't actually
make anything.

37:21.978 --> 37:23.893
Correct. This is everything

37:23.937 --> 37:25.895
that ever mattered to us.

37:25.939 --> 37:27.462
To me.

37:27.506 --> 37:30.509
No one makes synths
anymore, of any kind.

37:30.552 --> 37:33.033
It's a violation
of galactic treaty.

37:33.076 --> 37:36.210
But isn't it possible
to create a synthetic

37:36.254 --> 37:38.995
that looks fully human?

37:39.039 --> 37:40.127
The short answer is no.

37:40.170 --> 37:41.868
Well, give me the long answer.

37:41.911 --> 37:43.913
It'll still be no.Please.

37:43.957 --> 37:45.959
Humor me.

37:50.137 --> 37:53.053
It's a B4, isn't it?

37:53.096 --> 37:55.708
Looks so much like Data.

37:55.751 --> 37:57.144
He's an inferior copy.

37:57.187 --> 37:58.667
Data tried to download
the contents

37:58.711 --> 38:01.670
of his neural net into B4
just before his death.

38:02.802 --> 38:05.283
Almost all of
it was lost.

38:05.326 --> 38:08.111
Ultimately, B4 wasn't
much like Data at all.

38:08.155 --> 38:10.853
In fact,
no other synth has been.

38:10.897 --> 38:12.986
No.
And there's the rub.

38:13.029 --> 38:15.336
No one has ever been able
to redevelop the science

38:15.380 --> 38:16.903
used to create Data.

38:16.946 --> 38:19.384
Then came Bruce.

38:19.427 --> 38:23.823
Maddox. He recruited me
out of Starfleet.

38:23.866 --> 38:29.350
Despite Data's death,
we came so close.

38:29.394 --> 38:33.049
Then we got shut down,
and it crushed him.

38:33.093 --> 38:35.008
Where is he now?

38:35.051 --> 38:37.619
He disappeared after the ban.

38:37.663 --> 38:39.839
I've tried to find him, but...

38:39.882 --> 38:45.105
You said "despite Data's death,"
meaning that any new synthetic

38:45.148 --> 38:47.368
would have to be made from Data.

38:47.412 --> 38:48.978
Advanced ones, yes.

38:49.022 --> 38:51.024
If you had Data's neural net,

38:51.067 --> 38:52.895
perfecting
a flesh-and-blood host body

38:52.939 --> 38:53.940
would be
relatively simple.

38:53.983 --> 38:56.377
But his neurons died with him.

38:56.421 --> 38:59.511
See, now you're coming around to
that no I've been promising you.

39:02.601 --> 39:05.081
Does this mean anything to you?

39:07.910 --> 39:10.043
Where did you get that?

39:10.086 --> 39:12.437
From my tea-drinking companion.

39:12.480 --> 39:14.961
The one you said couldn't exist.

39:20.619 --> 39:23.404
I really...

39:23.448 --> 39:26.712
really wish you'd come
here on my day off.

39:29.236 --> 39:31.934
It's a symbol for
fractal neuronic cloning.

39:31.978 --> 39:34.197
I'm sorry?It was a radical,

39:34.241 --> 39:36.939
beautiful idea of Maddox's.

39:36.983 --> 39:40.116
His theory was that Data's
entire code, even his memories,

39:40.160 --> 39:42.945
could be reconstituted
from a single positronic neuron.

39:42.989 --> 39:47.602
If there is a synth out there
who is perfect, like you say...

39:47.646 --> 39:51.519
Then Data, or some part of him,

39:51.563 --> 39:54.043
an essence of him...Essence, yes.

39:54.087 --> 39:55.436
...would be alive.

39:55.480 --> 39:56.959
There'd be no way of knowing

39:57.003 --> 39:58.744
without examining...Dahj.

39:58.787 --> 40:00.528
The girl.

40:02.356 --> 40:04.053
Data's daughter.

40:04.097 --> 40:06.360
He always wanted
a daughter.

40:06.404 --> 40:09.102
I believe that Maddox
modeled her

40:09.145 --> 40:12.235
on an old painting of Data's.

40:12.279 --> 40:15.021
A female?

40:15.064 --> 40:17.415
Yes, I suppose you could
make them that way.

40:17.458 --> 40:19.242
Uh, I'm sorry? "Them"?

40:19.286 --> 40:22.115
They're created in pairs.

40:22.158 --> 40:24.813
Twins?

40:26.119 --> 40:27.816
Twins.

40:32.647 --> 40:35.911
So there's another one.

41:14.602 --> 41:16.604
Dr. Asha?

41:19.433 --> 41:22.175
I don't mean to intrude.
I'm Narek.

41:22.218 --> 41:23.698
I'm new here.

41:23.742 --> 41:25.352
Soji.

41:25.395 --> 41:28.921
That's a beautiful name.

41:28.964 --> 41:30.705
I've been reading
about your work.

41:30.749 --> 41:32.359
It's-it's fascinating.

41:32.402 --> 41:34.796
I feel like I've got
so many questions.

41:34.840 --> 41:36.668
And I feel like
you're about to ask them.

41:39.366 --> 41:41.716
That's nice.

41:41.760 --> 41:42.935
Your necklace.

41:42.978 --> 41:45.154
Uh, my father made it.

41:45.198 --> 41:47.722
One for me
and one for my sister.

41:47.766 --> 41:49.332
I'm a twin.

41:49.376 --> 41:51.987
Oh. I had a brother.

41:52.031 --> 41:53.946
Not a twin, but...

41:53.989 --> 41:55.991
we were really close.

41:56.035 --> 41:58.559
We, um...

41:58.603 --> 42:01.388
we lost him last year.

42:01.431 --> 42:03.782
Very unexpected.

42:04.957 --> 42:07.307
You're lucky
to have her.

42:07.350 --> 42:10.876
I'm sorry. You spend your day
fixing broken people.

42:10.919 --> 42:14.270
I'm guessing the last thing
you want when you get off work

42:14.314 --> 42:17.230
is to listen
to another sad story.

42:18.884 --> 42:20.886
Guess again.
