WEBVTT

00:05.043 --> 00:07.000
[sirens wailing]

00:22.086 --> 00:23.130
All right, boys...

00:23.173 --> 00:24.826
It's looking pretty good.

00:27.739 --> 00:28.913
Captain!

00:28.956 --> 00:30.608
Got one!

00:30.652 --> 00:32.521
Alive?

00:32.565 --> 00:33.913
No, sir.

00:48.739 --> 00:52.521
We're gonna need an M.E.
and the Arson Unit down here.

00:52.565 --> 00:54.304
[over radio]:
Copy that. We'll notify M.E.

00:54.347 --> 00:55.956
Arson Unit's on the way.

00:56.000 --> 00:57.000
[static crackles]

01:07.086 --> 01:09.043
Better call the Navy, too.

01:42.695 --> 01:44.086
What is this place?

01:44.130 --> 01:46.565
Warehouse is owned by
United Equinox Electronics.

01:46.608 --> 01:49.521
They make everything
from modems to toaster ovens.

01:49.565 --> 01:51.869
And according
to insurance records,

01:51.913 --> 01:54.869
they use it to store tax
records, corporate documents.

01:54.913 --> 01:55.956
What are we doing here?

01:58.217 --> 02:00.043
Nice look, Tony.

02:00.086 --> 02:01.521
What, is that blue collar
meets Ivy League?

02:01.565 --> 02:02.826
Chic Farmhand?

02:02.869 --> 02:04.000
Ring-a-ding-ding.

02:04.043 --> 02:05.521
I call it Practical Playboy.

02:05.565 --> 02:06.304
GIBBS:
Yeah, well...

02:08.043 --> 02:09.434
...this is what we're
here for, Heffie.

02:13.130 --> 02:15.869
United Equinox
also worked Navy projects.

02:15.913 --> 02:17.304
Including top-secret
weapons systems.

02:17.347 --> 02:18.521
And we're here
to see if

02:18.565 --> 02:19.869
anything sensitive
was damaged-- got it.

02:19.913 --> 02:20.434
That's right.

02:20.478 --> 02:22.260
So, let's go.

02:38.565 --> 02:39.739
NCIS.

02:39.782 --> 02:41.826
Baltimore Fire.
Site Inspector.

02:41.869 --> 02:43.086
Heard you guys
were called in.

02:43.130 --> 02:45.000
ZIVA: Any idea what
caused the fire?

02:45.043 --> 02:47.043
For that, you're gonna have
to talk to Baltimore Police.

02:47.086 --> 02:48.913
Arson Unit guy's
around here somewhere.

02:50.086 --> 02:51.000
Nice boots.

02:52.086 --> 02:53.391
Thanks.
I'm going for a new look.

02:53.434 --> 02:54.434
Crime Scene Chic.

02:54.478 --> 02:56.608
Actually earning
some style points.

02:56.652 --> 02:59.043
One more word about your boots,
you're gonna find mine

02:59.086 --> 03:00.739
up your ass, DiNozzo.

03:00.782 --> 03:03.086
DiNozzo?!

03:03.130 --> 03:05.086
Anthony DiNozzo?

03:06.826 --> 03:08.347
Jason King.

03:08.391 --> 03:12.000
Baltimore PD
Arson Unit.

03:13.000 --> 03:13.956
Jason.

03:14.000 --> 03:15.130
Wow.

03:15.173 --> 03:16.695
It's-it's been a little while.

03:16.739 --> 03:18.956
Yeah.

03:19.000 --> 03:20.347
You two know each other?

03:20.391 --> 03:22.913
Heard we're working
this together, sir,

03:22.956 --> 03:26.000
until we officially rule out
any connection to the Navy.

03:26.043 --> 03:27.130
Yeah, that's the plan.

03:27.173 --> 03:29.130
Well, boss, if this is
a homicide, then...

03:29.173 --> 03:30.739
I was Homicide for
two years

03:30.782 --> 03:32.782
before I made
Arson in February.

03:32.826 --> 03:34.608
February!
That's two months ago.

03:34.652 --> 03:36.086
Wow.

03:36.130 --> 03:37.521
Listen, I had no idea--

03:37.565 --> 03:39.391
Already started my
cause-and-origin investigation.

03:39.434 --> 03:40.956
Fire's back here.

03:41.000 --> 03:43.565
DiNozzo, you're with me.

03:43.608 --> 03:45.000
You two,
take the perimeter.

03:51.086 --> 03:52.173
GIBBS:
Duck, what do we got?

03:52.217 --> 03:54.434
It looks as if
dental records

03:54.478 --> 03:56.260
are the only hope
for identification.

03:56.304 --> 03:58.565
This the guy who
started the fire?
I doubt it.

03:58.608 --> 04:02.086
Arsonists rarely get caught
in their own conflagrations.

04:02.130 --> 04:03.086
KING:
That's correct.

04:03.130 --> 04:05.043
This man was most
likely a victim.

04:05.086 --> 04:06.782
Wrong time, wrong place?

04:06.826 --> 04:08.043
Or deliberate
time and place.

04:08.086 --> 04:09.956
Given the body's
badly burned condition,

04:10.000 --> 04:13.043
I'd say it was the
ignition point for the fire.

04:13.086 --> 04:14.347
Used the road flare
to start it.

04:14.391 --> 04:17.043
Johnny Storm, Human Torch.

04:17.086 --> 04:19.217
You ever see that movie,
the Fantastic Four?

04:19.260 --> 04:21.000
Arson?Looking that way.

04:21.043 --> 04:24.086
DUCKY: Yeah, but
the fire was so intense,

04:24.130 --> 04:26.043
it actually calcified the bone.

04:28.086 --> 04:29.869
This is very odd.

04:29.913 --> 04:32.260
KING: Gasoline and butane
burn off quickly,

04:32.304 --> 04:34.173
and at the same relative
temperature as paper or wood.

04:34.217 --> 04:37.956
Whatever our arsonist
used even scarred the
concrete floor.

04:38.000 --> 04:38.913
The guy really wanted
to cover his trail,

04:38.956 --> 04:40.173
destroy the evidence.

04:40.217 --> 04:42.869
Fire doesn't destroy
evidence, it creates it.

04:42.913 --> 04:45.565
Well, let's go find some.

04:45.608 --> 04:47.000
Actually, I had the chance

04:47.043 --> 04:48.608
to do some preliminary
processing.

04:48.652 --> 04:51.695
Every one of these drawers
is filled with burned files

04:51.739 --> 04:53.608
and paper ash,
except this one.

04:56.173 --> 04:57.869
Oh...

04:59.043 --> 05:01.000
Maybe the drawer was
empty before the fire.

05:01.043 --> 05:03.130
Lock was broken off
prior to the fire.

05:04.086 --> 05:05.217
Right there.

05:06.956 --> 05:08.260
KING: Somebody wanted
whatever was in this drawer.

05:08.304 --> 05:10.956
They went to a lot of
trouble to get it.

05:11.000 --> 05:12.391
Boss...

05:12.434 --> 05:15.043
I ran the card reader on the
warehouse's security gate.

05:15.086 --> 05:18.130
The last person swiped in
at 4:03 a.m.

05:18.173 --> 05:20.260
That's 40 minutes before
the fire was reported.

05:20.304 --> 05:22.043
McGEE:
Carter Plimpton, 42 years old.

05:22.086 --> 05:24.043
Lives in Fairmount.

05:24.086 --> 05:26.086
Five-ten, 170 pounds.

05:26.130 --> 05:28.043
Duck?

05:28.086 --> 05:29.434
Could be.

05:29.478 --> 05:32.652
Plimpton was a civilian
employee of United Equinox.

05:32.695 --> 05:34.695
TONY: Well, if the
victim's a civilian,

05:34.739 --> 05:37.434
then this isn't an
NCIS case, right?

05:37.478 --> 05:39.130
Wrong.

05:39.173 --> 05:40.782
Boss?

05:40.826 --> 05:41.652
GIBBS:
It's Navy.

05:41.695 --> 05:45.043
King... you're with us now.

05:45.086 --> 05:46.478
Yes... sir...

05:54.086 --> 05:56.869
McGEE: Dental records confirm
our victim is Carter Plimpton.

05:56.913 --> 05:58.043
Product systems analyst

05:58.086 --> 05:59.478
for United Equinox.

05:59.521 --> 06:00.782
Spent the last four years

06:00.826 --> 06:02.782
in their electrical
component department.

06:02.826 --> 06:04.217
This is exciting stuff.

06:04.260 --> 06:06.565
Tony, don't jump to
any conclusions, okay?

06:06.608 --> 06:07.695
Just 'cause the guy has
a nerdy job,

06:07.739 --> 06:09.608
it does not mean that he's...

06:10.739 --> 06:12.347
Okay, he was single.

06:13.521 --> 06:14.565
And he ran a Skyrim
message board.

06:14.608 --> 06:15.739
How many cats
did he have?

06:15.782 --> 06:17.043
None.

06:17.086 --> 06:18.260
But, apparently,
he did have a thing

06:18.304 --> 06:20.826
for Japanese anime pillows.

06:20.869 --> 06:22.565
Oh. That's unfortunate.

06:22.608 --> 06:23.695
Although, she's kinda hot.

06:23.739 --> 06:25.347
It's a cartoon, Tony.

06:25.391 --> 06:27.347
Hey, don't knock
the cartoon ladies.

06:27.391 --> 06:28.478
You got your Betty Rubble,

06:28.521 --> 06:29.826
your Ariel from
The Little Mermaid,

06:29.869 --> 06:31.260
and Jessica Rabbit...

06:31.304 --> 06:33.043
Those ladies got me
through puberty.

06:33.086 --> 06:34.869
You've been through
puberty?

06:34.913 --> 06:35.869
Had not noticed.

06:35.913 --> 06:36.956
[wry laugh]

06:37.000 --> 06:39.043
Well, you noticed Jason King.

06:39.086 --> 06:40.478
What is it with chicks
and firemen?

06:40.521 --> 06:41.478
And don't say hoses.

06:41.521 --> 06:43.043
I wasn't going to.

06:43.086 --> 06:44.304
Um, he's not a fireman.

06:44.347 --> 06:45.652
But, yes, your cop friend
is very, um...

06:45.695 --> 06:47.347
hot.

06:47.391 --> 06:49.000
He's not my friend.

06:49.043 --> 06:50.782
I met him once.

06:50.826 --> 06:52.217
20 years ago.

06:52.260 --> 06:54.869
I'm actually kind of surprised
he recognized me.

06:56.608 --> 06:58.956
Well, clearly, your first
meeting was important to him.

06:59.000 --> 07:02.478
I, uh, assume
it involved a girl?

07:04.260 --> 07:05.956
He was nine years old.

07:07.608 --> 07:08.956
Never assume, McGee.

07:09.000 --> 07:10.217
Rule Number Eight.
Got it, boss.

07:18.782 --> 07:22.782
Speaking of the number eight,
that's the... Phantom Eight.

07:22.826 --> 07:24.739
McGEE: Part of the
Navy's Watcher Fleet.

07:24.782 --> 07:26.130
The bad part.

07:26.173 --> 07:27.782
Well, Watcher does
some good, too.

07:27.826 --> 07:29.260
They help ensure the
Naval Fleet's security.

07:29.304 --> 07:31.130
I think we can all
agree the Phantom Eight

07:31.173 --> 07:32.695
had a couple of
bad apples.

07:32.739 --> 07:35.956
Two of these men were murdered
in the last nine months.

07:39.130 --> 07:40.913
Three.

07:40.956 --> 07:42.739
Three.

07:42.782 --> 07:44.478
Wow, look at that.

07:46.521 --> 07:49.695
Our extra-crispy victim was a
member of the Phantom Eight.

07:49.739 --> 07:51.521
If he was Black Ops,
that explains why

07:51.565 --> 07:53.217
there's no paper trail
on his past.

07:53.260 --> 07:55.347
Guess the guy's not a
cubicle nerd, after all.

07:55.391 --> 07:57.000
Which means there
could've been a connection

07:57.043 --> 07:58.521
between Watcher Fleet
and the fire.

07:58.565 --> 08:00.086
Ziva, find 'em.
Take McGee with you.

08:00.130 --> 08:02.608
Start with Plimpton's
supervisor.

08:02.652 --> 08:04.130
DiNozzo, dig deeper
on our victim.

08:04.173 --> 08:05.869
All the way to China, boss.

08:10.086 --> 08:12.043
KING: I admire your
attention to detail, Doctor.

08:12.086 --> 08:15.956
People your age sometimes
disregard scientific
investigation

08:16.000 --> 08:16.913
in favor of instinct.

08:16.956 --> 08:19.956
People my age? Here.

08:22.652 --> 08:23.913
Sorry, sir.

08:23.956 --> 08:25.217
It's just that applying
scientific methods

08:25.260 --> 08:27.086
to fire investigation
is relatively new.

08:31.000 --> 08:32.782
These burn patterns show all
the way through the dermis.

08:32.826 --> 08:34.217
Yes, they do.

08:34.260 --> 08:36.608
It's so unusual.

08:36.652 --> 08:37.869
What is, Duck?

08:37.913 --> 08:40.086
Well, Mr. Plimpton's skin

08:40.130 --> 08:41.782
was double burned.

08:41.826 --> 08:43.869
Once wasn't enough.

08:43.913 --> 08:45.478
Well, looking at
one of several deep,

08:45.521 --> 08:47.347
uniformly round tissue burns,

08:47.391 --> 08:49.608
about one inch in diameter,

08:49.652 --> 08:51.608
which just happens to match
this road flare.

08:51.652 --> 08:53.217
DUCKY: The pattern
and carbon sheen

08:53.260 --> 08:56.478
indicate that these
burn spots were inflicted

08:56.521 --> 08:58.826
both ante- and perimortem.

08:58.869 --> 08:59.913
Torture with a flare.

08:59.956 --> 09:02.043
Yes, however, while
the right arm

09:02.086 --> 09:03.956
is covered in
these burns,

09:04.000 --> 09:07.304
there are only three
on the left arm.

09:07.347 --> 09:09.391
Well, the killer
stopped torturing him.

09:09.434 --> 09:10.391
He got what he wanted.

09:10.434 --> 09:12.260
Which was what?

09:16.260 --> 09:17.347
That's better.

09:17.391 --> 09:19.217
Jack Murdoch?

09:19.260 --> 09:21.826
You must be NCIS.

09:21.869 --> 09:23.782
Yeah, sorry about
the, uh, the getup,

09:23.826 --> 09:26.434
but most things in here
don't react well to static.

09:26.478 --> 09:29.956
McGEE: Ooh, are they working
on the new I-triple-E protocol?

09:30.000 --> 09:33.434
I bought your Nexus series
router two years ago.

09:33.478 --> 09:35.826
Actually sent in
a few design suggestions.

09:35.869 --> 09:39.739
Are you, uh, here for a
refund or nerd extra credit?

09:39.782 --> 09:42.043
Excuse me?

09:42.086 --> 09:44.434
Sorry, uh, I just,
I get tired of

09:44.478 --> 09:45.913
people assuming
we're all dweebs

09:45.956 --> 09:48.913
with nothing better
to do than talk shop.

09:48.956 --> 09:51.608
I take it you're here
about Carter.

09:51.652 --> 09:53.913
Yes. Is this what Mr.
Plimpton did for you?

09:53.956 --> 09:55.739
No. In here, we create.

09:55.782 --> 09:58.478
Carter liked
to destroy things.

09:58.521 --> 10:01.434
You know, uh, product testing
and finding failure points.

10:01.478 --> 10:03.956
What was he doing in your
records warehouse this morning?

10:04.000 --> 10:05.521
His job.

10:05.565 --> 10:08.739
Storing non-critical reports
and inventory information.

10:08.782 --> 10:11.565
Non-critical?

10:11.608 --> 10:13.043
There was nothing
in that warehouse

10:13.086 --> 10:15.130
with any national
security implications.

10:15.173 --> 10:17.043
I'll send you
the inventory.

10:17.086 --> 10:20.260
"Classified" does not
mean "top secret."

10:20.304 --> 10:24.043
Were you aware of Plimpton's
history with Watcher Fleet?

10:24.086 --> 10:25.913
Watcher Fleet? No.

10:25.956 --> 10:29.739
But he was always going on
about Skyrim

10:29.782 --> 10:31.260
and Old Republic?

10:31.304 --> 10:35.695
You are talking about dorky
role-playing games, right?

10:35.739 --> 10:37.043
You must be into those, huh?

10:37.086 --> 10:40.217
Until I took an arrow
in the knee.

10:48.782 --> 10:50.739
Research, Abbs?

10:50.782 --> 10:52.913
Um, nope. It's lunch.

10:52.956 --> 10:54.608
Only I ran out
of chocolate.

10:54.652 --> 10:56.565
You want some?
No.

10:56.608 --> 10:58.739
Pyromaniacs?

10:58.782 --> 11:00.173
Scientists, Gibbs.

11:00.217 --> 11:02.826
Okay, yeah, they're kind
of pyromaniacs, too.

11:02.869 --> 11:05.260
But these are chemical
reactions, which can be

11:05.304 --> 11:06.652
measured and
controlled.

11:06.695 --> 11:08.217
Hmm, doesn't look
controlled to me.

11:08.260 --> 11:11.173
That's because the fire in the
video is something different.

11:11.217 --> 11:13.391
It's a thermite reaction.

11:13.434 --> 11:15.086
I found evidence of
it on our victim.

11:15.130 --> 11:19.000
Thermite is a simple compound
of iron oxide

11:19.043 --> 11:20.260
and aluminum powder.

11:20.304 --> 11:22.739
When it's mixed together
properly and ignited,

11:22.782 --> 11:25.086
it can burn ten times
hotter than wood.

11:25.130 --> 11:26.956
And once it gets started,
you can't put it out.

11:27.000 --> 11:28.826
It burns through metal.

11:28.869 --> 11:30.782
Why didn't it completely
destroy the body?

11:30.826 --> 11:33.913
Our killer must have added
something to his mixture

11:33.956 --> 11:35.521
to slow the
chemical reaction,

11:35.565 --> 11:37.695
which is something
that an arsonist

11:37.739 --> 11:39.913
or pyromaniac
would never do.

11:39.956 --> 11:43.739
Unlike our guys in the video,
our killer is

11:43.782 --> 11:46.173
focusing the power of thermite.

11:46.217 --> 11:47.695
Controlling it.

11:47.739 --> 11:48.695
Yeah.

11:48.739 --> 11:51.739
But I have
no idea why.

11:51.782 --> 11:53.869
All right. Thanks.

11:57.826 --> 11:59.826
Jason. Hey.

11:59.869 --> 12:01.608
Gonna do paperwork
at the station house.

12:01.652 --> 12:02.956
Be back in the morning.

12:03.000 --> 12:03.739
Back to
Baltimore, huh?

12:03.782 --> 12:04.826
I miss that city.

12:04.869 --> 12:07.913
Sometimes.

12:07.956 --> 12:09.869
So, arson
investigator.

12:09.913 --> 12:12.608
That's a big job,
especially for someone your age.

12:12.652 --> 12:14.478
Must have made some
major sacrifices.

12:14.521 --> 12:15.695
What do you mean?

12:15.739 --> 12:16.869
Well, I looked
you up.

12:16.913 --> 12:18.826
You were offered a
full ride at Duke.

12:18.869 --> 12:20.043
Point guard-- I
heard your jumper

12:20.086 --> 12:21.565
was almost as
good as mine.

12:21.608 --> 12:23.217
Better.

12:23.260 --> 12:25.217
But you gave it up
to become a cop.

12:25.260 --> 12:26.826
That's right.

12:32.173 --> 12:33.608
About how we last left things.

12:33.652 --> 12:35.043
I think we should talk.

12:35.086 --> 12:37.565
Unless it's about the case,
I got nothing to say.

12:37.608 --> 12:40.391
This means you haven't
forgiven me about your sister?

12:40.434 --> 12:42.869
That's exactly what it means.

12:42.913 --> 12:44.608
[pushes button]

12:48.956 --> 12:51.956
Boss, I've been digging through
the warehouse inventory

12:52.000 --> 12:53.434
from United Equinox.

12:53.478 --> 12:55.521
Didn't appear that anything
important was stored there.

12:55.565 --> 12:57.347
But?

13:07.956 --> 13:10.260
I hacked into the Navy
Intelligence database.

13:10.304 --> 13:14.260
I was only able to get past the
first level of security, but...

13:14.304 --> 13:15.260
You found something.

13:15.304 --> 13:16.826
Watcher Fleet had worked on

13:16.869 --> 13:18.565
a top-secret project
called Aquamarine.

13:18.608 --> 13:21.260
The only reason it stuck out
to me was 'cause there was

13:21.304 --> 13:22.739
a file box
in the warehouse inventory

13:22.782 --> 13:24.217
listed under the same name.

13:24.260 --> 13:27.086
United Equinox was developing
something for the Navy.

13:27.130 --> 13:29.173
What is Aquamarine?

13:29.217 --> 13:31.695
Neither database said.

13:31.739 --> 13:33.652
But the project was initiated
four years ago

13:33.695 --> 13:35.565
during the time Plimpton was
with Watcher Fleet.

13:35.608 --> 13:37.652
McGee, that's why
he was tortured.

13:37.695 --> 13:39.565
Someone was looking
for Navy secrets.

13:39.608 --> 13:41.608
Well, they found them.

13:47.608 --> 13:49.347
TONY:
Carter Plimpton.

13:49.391 --> 13:50.695
Take two.

13:50.739 --> 13:52.739
Plimpton left
the Navy Watcher Fleet in '08

13:52.782 --> 13:55.043
to take a job at United
Equinox Electronics.

13:55.086 --> 13:57.043
ZIVA:
So did he leave there
to work on

13:57.086 --> 14:00.130
this Aquamarine project
for Equinox

14:00.173 --> 14:02.130
And what is
Aquamarine?

14:02.173 --> 14:03.347
I'm still waiting for
Navy Intelligence

14:03.391 --> 14:04.652
or United Equinox to confirm

14:04.695 --> 14:06.434
the project
even exists.

14:06.478 --> 14:08.826
ZIVA: Uh-huh.Don't hold
your breath.

14:08.869 --> 14:11.000
TONY:
So while we're
waiting to find out

14:11.043 --> 14:12.652
what our killer took
from the warehouse...

14:12.695 --> 14:14.217
Focus on what he left behind.

14:14.260 --> 14:15.434
Thermite residue.

14:15.478 --> 14:17.043
Not many arsonists
use thermite.

14:17.086 --> 14:18.434
Which means if this guy

14:18.478 --> 14:19.347
has a criminal
record...

14:19.391 --> 14:21.043
We can cross-reference
his M.O.

14:21.086 --> 14:22.478
McGEE:
Boss, I got
a hit here.

14:22.521 --> 14:24.347
Billy Wayne.

14:24.391 --> 14:26.391
Six arrests for
arson-related crimes,

14:26.434 --> 14:28.217
two involving
thermite accelerants,

14:28.260 --> 14:30.347
including a fire he set
at home last year,

14:30.391 --> 14:31.826
killing his wife and two kids.

14:31.869 --> 14:33.000
Serving life in prison.

14:33.043 --> 14:35.000
Oh. So he can't be
our warehouse guy.

14:35.043 --> 14:37.000
No. But he'll give
us a glimpse into

14:37.043 --> 14:38.565
the mind of the
person who is.

14:40.260 --> 14:42.260
I was about
to say that.
Ziva.

14:42.304 --> 14:43.347
Get him in here.

14:43.391 --> 14:44.608
Mm-hmm.

14:48.260 --> 14:50.695
GIBBS:
Thermite.

14:50.739 --> 14:53.608
Your calling card.

14:53.652 --> 14:55.391
These are
good pictures.

14:55.434 --> 14:57.086
What kind of
camera is this?

14:57.130 --> 14:58.434
Billy.

14:58.478 --> 15:00.434
Focus.

15:01.521 --> 15:03.434
Fire.

15:05.478 --> 15:08.521
This warehouse-- it's
nothing but paper.

15:08.565 --> 15:10.217
Boxed files, right?

15:10.260 --> 15:11.913
And that's meaningful because?

15:13.521 --> 15:16.260
Ignition point of paper is low.

15:16.304 --> 15:18.608
Whoever lit this, they could
have easily used gasoline

15:18.652 --> 15:20.478
or kerosene to do
the same damage.

15:20.521 --> 15:22.826
Why thermite?

15:22.869 --> 15:25.608
Two reasons.

15:25.652 --> 15:27.869
To send a
message or...

15:27.913 --> 15:28.913
Or?

15:30.956 --> 15:33.043
For fun.

15:33.086 --> 15:35.260
Thermite's
tricky stuff.

15:35.304 --> 15:38.478
Whoever lit this,
they might have wanted

15:38.521 --> 15:40.260
to see how it plays--

15:40.304 --> 15:43.043
speed, intensity,

15:43.086 --> 15:45.347
the ventilation and
oxygen it requires.

15:45.391 --> 15:47.869
A good torch man

15:47.913 --> 15:51.695
always runs tests,
practices before the event.

15:51.739 --> 15:54.478
Event?

15:54.521 --> 15:58.869
This ain't lighter fluid
and matchsticks, missy.

15:58.913 --> 16:00.478
There's a reason
you use thermite.

16:00.521 --> 16:03.304
Name one.

16:03.347 --> 16:07.347
I did a hotel once
outside of Manassas.

16:07.391 --> 16:10.000
Used a slow-burn
thermite mix

16:10.043 --> 16:13.391
in a room two floors
above the boiler room.

16:13.434 --> 16:15.217
Slow burning?

16:15.260 --> 16:19.521
The reduced combustion rate
gave me enough time to get away

16:19.565 --> 16:22.695
before it burned through the
floor and ignited the boiler.

16:22.739 --> 16:24.956
It was beautiful.

16:25.000 --> 16:27.869
Four people died in that fire.

16:27.913 --> 16:30.956
Yeah, there's that.

16:31.000 --> 16:33.478
Man thinks he
invented fire.

16:33.521 --> 16:36.652
Truth is, it's nature's
most perfect gift to us.

16:36.695 --> 16:40.913
Razes great cities just to be
replaced by even greater ones.

16:40.956 --> 16:42.913
Hey, Nero,

16:42.956 --> 16:47.347
ever share your slow-burn
thermite recipe with anyone?

16:47.391 --> 16:49.956
I may have mentioned
it to Janice.

16:50.000 --> 16:52.173
She's writing a book.

16:52.217 --> 16:54.434
About me and my work.

16:54.478 --> 16:56.043
She visited
me last week.

16:56.086 --> 16:57.739
What did you tell Janice?

16:57.782 --> 17:00.956
A magician never gives
away his tricks, honey.

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
You'll have to buy the book.

17:04.043 --> 17:06.608
How do you contact Janice?

17:06.652 --> 17:08.652
I just told you, she visited me.

17:12.173 --> 17:13.869
Wait. You're not leaving,
are you?

17:13.913 --> 17:17.000
Wait. W-What's gonna happen now?

17:17.043 --> 17:19.173
This was thermite test
number four.

17:19.217 --> 17:20.478
I used linseed oil

17:20.521 --> 17:22.173
as a possible
reaction inhibitor.

17:22.217 --> 17:23.173
Smart.

17:23.217 --> 17:25.695
So...

17:25.739 --> 17:27.869
what got you so into fire?

17:27.913 --> 17:31.347
Was it too many late nights
watching Fahrenheit 451?

17:31.391 --> 17:32.478
The Towering Inferno.

17:32.521 --> 17:34.521
Wait, Backdraft.

17:34.565 --> 17:38.260
I was in a fire
when I was a kid.

17:38.304 --> 17:39.304
Arson.

17:39.347 --> 17:40.434
They never caught the guy.

17:40.478 --> 17:42.391
Oh.

17:45.043 --> 17:46.347
Still burning
way too hot.

17:46.391 --> 17:48.173
Yeah.

17:48.217 --> 17:49.695
Burned right through.

17:49.739 --> 17:52.478
I guess linseed oil wasn't
our killer's secret ingredient.

17:52.521 --> 17:54.739
Well, on the
bright side,

17:54.782 --> 17:57.478
you can now help
me keep testing.

17:57.521 --> 17:59.826
I am a sucker
for empirical data.

18:02.391 --> 18:04.521
McGee.

18:04.565 --> 18:07.217
Still nothing from
Naval Intelligence, boss.

18:07.260 --> 18:08.782
And I can't
dig any deeper

18:08.826 --> 18:10.782
into Watcher Fleet without
setting off any firewall alarms.

18:10.826 --> 18:13.043
United Equinox.

18:13.086 --> 18:14.608
Other than what was taken
from the warehouse,

18:14.652 --> 18:16.782
they have no records of
any project called Aquamarine.

18:16.826 --> 18:18.521
Billy Wayne's biographer.

18:18.565 --> 18:22.043
Our mystery author used a fake
I.D. to visit Wayne in prison.

18:22.086 --> 18:24.217
I did pull the prison
security footage.

18:24.260 --> 18:26.173
Running facial
recognition now.

18:26.217 --> 18:27.304
So far,
nothing's popped.

18:27.347 --> 18:29.347
Well, keep looking.
Yup.

18:29.391 --> 18:31.391
[computer alarm dings]

18:32.043 --> 18:35.000
Boss, an alert
just came through from

18:35.043 --> 18:36.478
the Baltimore
Fire Department.

18:36.521 --> 18:38.478
They're responding to a
suspicious blaze on a cargo ship

18:38.521 --> 18:40.913
less than a mile
from the warehouse fire.

18:40.956 --> 18:42.173
Call DiNozzo, call Jason.

18:42.217 --> 18:43.869
On it.

18:56.391 --> 18:58.391
What do we got this time?

18:58.434 --> 19:00.782
Battalions 51
and 62 responded.

19:00.826 --> 19:03.304
Turned out to be some tarps
on top of a cargo hold.

19:03.347 --> 19:04.347
No injuries.

19:07.956 --> 19:10.956
[boat horn blows]

19:13.173 --> 19:14.695
10-4.

19:14.739 --> 19:17.913
Hit that hot spot
right there.

19:20.000 --> 19:21.391
Hey.

19:21.434 --> 19:22.391
Hey.

19:22.434 --> 19:23.391
Cargo?

19:23.434 --> 19:24.695
Empty.

19:24.739 --> 19:26.347
Off-loaded yesterday;
load of fruit from Chile.

19:26.391 --> 19:28.173
Got a cause?That's for him to decide.

19:28.217 --> 19:30.695
But based on the fact
that the solid steel deck

19:30.739 --> 19:32.260
showed signs
of heat fatigue...

19:32.304 --> 19:34.086
Used an accelerant?Powerful one.

19:34.130 --> 19:36.000
Thermite?

19:36.043 --> 19:37.347
JASON:
Why the hell was

19:37.391 --> 19:40.478
our guy burning tarps
on an empty cargo vessel?

19:40.521 --> 19:44.391
Finding out, boss.

19:44.434 --> 19:46.826
Been on a few more
ships than you.

19:46.869 --> 19:49.000
Been on a few more
arson cases.

19:49.043 --> 19:50.260
[sniffing]

19:50.304 --> 19:51.869
This way.

20:00.043 --> 20:02.347
I can smell
ashes, too.

20:02.391 --> 20:04.000
It's not ashes
I'm smelling.

20:10.826 --> 20:12.695
I was agent afloat
for a while;

20:12.739 --> 20:13.913
there's a lot
of fishy smells.

20:13.956 --> 20:16.913
Is this Lassie thing
really necess...
Shh!

20:16.956 --> 20:18.304
[whispers]:
Sorry.

20:23.913 --> 20:25.913
Ship's wiring
runs through here.

20:44.913 --> 20:45.782
Move!

20:55.086 --> 20:56.260
I'll get the fire crew.

20:56.304 --> 20:57.652
No. Door's
an air lock.

20:57.695 --> 20:59.869
Once the oxygen burns
out, so does the fire.

21:08.304 --> 21:11.956
So, Arson Welles,
what the hell was that?

21:12.000 --> 21:13.304
That was a trap.

21:13.347 --> 21:16.130
And we almost got caught.

21:16.173 --> 21:18.173
Guess we're even.

21:30.043 --> 21:31.260
What do we got, Abbs?

21:31.304 --> 21:33.086
The source of the flash-fire
on the cargo ship.

21:33.130 --> 21:34.565
Bomb?

21:34.608 --> 21:36.217
Actually, there
was no bomb.

21:36.260 --> 21:38.304
It's much more complicated
than that, Agent Gibbs.

21:38.347 --> 21:40.695
But don't worry--
we can explain it.

21:40.739 --> 21:42.521
Then do.
Okay.

21:42.565 --> 21:45.043
Instead of a bomb,
someone set a small

21:45.086 --> 21:48.043
and well-placed thermite
charge in this junction box.

21:48.086 --> 21:50.217
My guess is that's why
the tarp fire was set.

21:50.260 --> 21:52.000
A distraction.Everybody's running

21:52.043 --> 21:53.434
around the ship on and off.

21:53.478 --> 21:54.869
Nobody's checking
the crew carefully.

21:54.913 --> 21:56.869
Our arsonist
must have used the same

21:56.913 --> 21:58.913
slow-burning thermite
that was in the warehouse,

21:58.956 --> 22:00.391
because it
managed to melt

22:00.434 --> 22:02.434
through the wiring's
insulation,

22:02.478 --> 22:03.739
but to not completely
destroy it.

22:03.782 --> 22:04.869
Which left the wires
to short out.

22:04.913 --> 22:06.869
An electrical fire.
ABBY:
Exactly.

22:06.913 --> 22:09.913
But an electrical fire
doesn't cause the same kind

22:09.956 --> 22:12.521
of immediate
and intense fireball.

22:12.565 --> 22:13.869
So why'd this one?

22:13.913 --> 22:15.913
I'm so very glad you asked.

22:15.956 --> 22:18.478
Exposure to the intense
heat of the thermite

22:18.521 --> 22:21.260
caused the insulation
in the wires to carbonize.

22:21.304 --> 22:22.434
And that shouldn't
have happened.

22:22.478 --> 22:23.608
The wiring is flawed.

22:23.652 --> 22:25.043
Rather than working
as an insulator,

22:25.086 --> 22:26.478
the coating
on the wires

22:26.521 --> 22:27.913
actually became
a conductor,

22:27.956 --> 22:29.347
which rapidly
spread the fire.

22:29.391 --> 22:30.956
ABBY:
Very rapidly.

22:31.000 --> 22:33.869
If Jason hadn't suffocated
the fire by closing the door,

22:33.913 --> 22:36.043
the wiring throughout
the entire ship

22:36.086 --> 22:37.521
could have
flash-fireballed.

22:37.565 --> 22:39.782
Our arsonist knew the
ship's wiring weakness.

22:39.826 --> 22:41.565
How?

22:41.608 --> 22:44.043
Guess who manufactured
the wiring.

22:44.086 --> 22:46.478
United Equinox Electronics.

22:46.521 --> 22:49.000
That's what was in
the missing file.

22:49.043 --> 22:51.173
Well, if it was, it still
doesn't explain the connection

22:51.217 --> 22:54.260
to the Watcher Fleet.

22:59.304 --> 23:01.826
United Equinox
internal memos.

23:01.869 --> 23:04.956
Found them encrypted
on Plimpton's laptop.

23:05.000 --> 23:08.347
You were supplying faulty
wiring to shipping vessels.

23:08.391 --> 23:10.956
Not true.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.608
Then why did Plimpton request

23:12.652 --> 23:15.000
a recall inquiry
nine months ago?

23:15.043 --> 23:17.695
He was doing his job,
looking for flaws.

23:17.739 --> 23:21.130
There are flaws in everything
if the conditions are perfect.

23:21.173 --> 23:23.173
Perfect here.

23:24.913 --> 23:27.000
Bad wiring.

23:30.391 --> 23:34.260
Look, I read Plimpton's memos.

23:34.304 --> 23:37.347
Only under extremely
rare circumstances

23:37.391 --> 23:39.086
could the wiring
be corrupted.

23:39.130 --> 23:40.869
A scenario so remote,

23:40.913 --> 23:44.260
its statistical probability
was almost zero.

23:44.304 --> 23:45.782
I don't know.

23:45.826 --> 23:48.260
Sounds like a bunch
of geek speak to me.

23:50.478 --> 23:53.043
There weren't enough
proven cases of flashover

23:53.086 --> 23:56.043
to legally warrant a recall
or even a warning.

23:56.086 --> 23:59.391
We were following
the letter of the law.

23:59.434 --> 24:02.173
Somebody killed
your employee,

24:02.217 --> 24:03.826
took the only
detailed file

24:03.869 --> 24:05.130
about what was wrong
with your wiring

24:05.173 --> 24:06.652
and demonstrated
the problem.

24:06.695 --> 24:08.608
All in the last two days.

24:10.956 --> 24:12.173
[sighs]

24:12.217 --> 24:14.521
Look, uh...

24:14.565 --> 24:17.217
I'm sorry about
Carter, but...

24:17.260 --> 24:21.130
none of this has anything to do
with me or my company.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.695
Navy Watcher Fleet.

24:30.739 --> 24:32.173
Plimpton knew about a file

24:32.217 --> 24:33.956
that matched something
in your database.

24:34.000 --> 24:35.043
Aquamarine?

24:35.086 --> 24:37.086
GIBBS:
We think it was about

24:37.130 --> 24:38.695
your bad wiring.

24:38.739 --> 24:41.956
Look, I told you, our
wiring was well within

24:42.000 --> 24:43.913
any acceptable risk model.

24:43.956 --> 24:47.000
Besides, we installed it
over four years ago.

24:47.043 --> 24:48.869
For the Navy.
No.

24:48.913 --> 24:50.043
Civilian market only.

24:50.086 --> 24:52.173
We never sold it to the Navy.

24:52.217 --> 24:56.130
And I told you,
I never heard of Watcher Fleet.

25:07.347 --> 25:09.652
Tony's catching up
on his case reports.

25:09.695 --> 25:10.869
What's wrong?

25:10.913 --> 25:12.086
He's been this way

25:12.130 --> 25:14.869
ever since he got back
from the cargo ship.

25:14.913 --> 25:16.521
We have to ask him
about this.

25:16.565 --> 25:18.521
Yeah.

25:25.782 --> 25:26.913
Can I help you?

25:33.826 --> 25:35.652
Is that you, Tony?

25:35.695 --> 25:37.782
Be honest-- is that you?

25:38.869 --> 25:40.782
Yeah.

25:40.826 --> 25:42.565
You saved Jason from a fire?

25:42.608 --> 25:44.565
It was the kid's lucky day.

25:46.086 --> 25:47.521
Okay.

25:47.565 --> 25:49.434
What happened?

25:49.478 --> 25:52.000
[sighs]

25:57.086 --> 26:00.000
Final Four was in Baltimore.

26:00.043 --> 26:02.000
Getting ready
to play UCLA.

26:02.043 --> 26:03.043
Basketball, Ziva.

26:03.086 --> 26:04.434
And?

26:08.086 --> 26:09.956
And I was out for a walk.

26:10.000 --> 26:14.043
I was trying to clear my head,
focus for the game.

26:14.086 --> 26:19.434
And I saw smoke
coming out of this townhouse.

26:19.478 --> 26:23.521
I heard a scream,
so I went in.

26:23.565 --> 26:25.521
How come you never told us?

26:25.565 --> 26:27.652
You should be proud.

26:28.695 --> 26:30.826
It was more complicated
than that.

26:32.695 --> 26:33.956
[boy screaming]

26:34.000 --> 26:36.956
Is anybody up here?

26:37.000 --> 26:38.043
Hello!

26:38.086 --> 26:39.826
[groans]

26:43.086 --> 26:45.043
Whoa!

26:45.086 --> 26:46.217
[glass shattering]

26:49.260 --> 26:51.217
BOY: Help me!

26:51.260 --> 26:54.260
[boy coughing]
Aah!

26:57.086 --> 26:59.956
Hello?

27:00.000 --> 27:02.478
BOY [coughing]: Help!

27:05.086 --> 27:07.043
Hey. You okay?

27:07.086 --> 27:09.000
[whimpering]

27:09.043 --> 27:11.173
You all right?

27:11.217 --> 27:13.869
Okay.
It's going to be okay.

27:13.913 --> 27:16.217
Come here.
[crying]

27:17.260 --> 27:19.739
Just hold on to me, okay?

27:21.000 --> 27:22.391
Amy!

27:22.434 --> 27:24.217
GIRL:
Jason, help!

27:24.260 --> 27:25.260
My sister!

27:25.304 --> 27:26.478
I can't get out!

27:26.521 --> 27:29.000
Help her!

27:30.086 --> 27:31.043
Please!All right, all right.

27:31.086 --> 27:33.391
AMY: Help!

27:33.434 --> 27:36.347
She's trapped!

27:36.391 --> 27:39.043
AMY [crying]: Help me!

27:39.086 --> 27:41.478
AMY: Help!

27:41.521 --> 27:43.173
JASON: We have to get her!

27:46.217 --> 27:48.043
Amy!
[grunts]

27:48.086 --> 27:49.826
Please!

27:49.869 --> 27:52.086
Don't leave her!

27:55.826 --> 27:58.043
I had to make a choice.

27:58.086 --> 28:00.565
Save Jason...

28:00.608 --> 28:05.043
or risk all of us getting killed
trying to save his sister.

28:05.086 --> 28:07.304
I chose.

28:08.913 --> 28:10.695
She was four.

28:10.739 --> 28:12.000
Okay. What do we got?

28:13.565 --> 28:15.869
Uh, we got a hit
on a phone call

28:15.913 --> 28:18.043
Billy the firebug
made from prison.

28:18.086 --> 28:19.260
Yeah, and?

28:19.304 --> 28:22.478
Well, number belongs
to a Mary Gardocki.

28:22.521 --> 28:25.391
Mary's passport photo
is a perfect match

28:25.434 --> 28:27.347
to the prison security footage.

28:27.391 --> 28:28.956
Bring her ass in.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.260
Mm-hmm.

28:32.217 --> 28:34.000
Right, boss.

28:46.043 --> 28:48.000
You helped.

28:48.043 --> 28:49.956
Others didn't.

28:50.000 --> 28:52.043
I know.

28:52.086 --> 28:54.043
Good. Get out of here.

29:11.782 --> 29:13.782
What?

29:19.478 --> 29:21.173
Fire.

29:22.956 --> 29:24.391
That what you

29:24.434 --> 29:26.173
and Billy Wayne talked about?

29:27.739 --> 29:29.434
I'm writing a book.

29:29.478 --> 29:31.347
Oh, bull.

29:33.478 --> 29:36.000
Employment records.

29:38.043 --> 29:39.391
Yes.

29:39.434 --> 29:42.434
I've been the leading
sales rep at Curway Chemical

29:42.478 --> 29:44.043
three years running.

29:44.086 --> 29:45.478
So?

29:45.521 --> 29:47.608
So you sell C-4.

29:47.652 --> 29:49.478
Napalm.

29:49.521 --> 29:51.739
To everyone
from the U.S. government

29:51.782 --> 29:53.173
to Somali warlords.

29:53.217 --> 29:55.000
I'm good at
what I do.

29:55.043 --> 29:56.217
And it's legal.

29:56.260 --> 29:58.304
What's your point?

30:03.695 --> 30:05.173
You ever sell
to Navy Watcher Fleet?

30:06.608 --> 30:08.565
They're real?

30:08.608 --> 30:10.608
They exist?

30:10.652 --> 30:12.217
I've heard of them.

30:13.260 --> 30:16.043
Never met them.

30:16.086 --> 30:18.608
Maybe you could get me
an intro.

30:20.173 --> 30:22.608
The best salesmen...

30:22.652 --> 30:24.434
they're the best liars.

30:28.652 --> 30:31.043
Are you lying to me, Mare?

30:32.782 --> 30:34.913
Absolutely not.

30:47.391 --> 30:49.521
Thermite burns are nasty, huh?

30:49.565 --> 30:50.869
I can explain.

30:50.913 --> 30:52.391
Mm, I can't wait.

30:52.434 --> 30:55.956
I've been using Billy to
develop a more stable thermite.

30:56.000 --> 30:59.000
A patent could mean millions.

30:59.043 --> 31:02.652
If the thermite in your burn
matches our victim...

31:02.695 --> 31:04.347
It won't.

31:04.391 --> 31:06.956
I didn't kill anyone.

31:11.826 --> 31:15.304
If I don't believe you...

31:15.347 --> 31:17.652
don't be disappointed.

31:17.695 --> 31:20.000
I don't know anything
about a murder.

31:22.478 --> 31:25.565
I've been in the burn center
for the last three days.

31:25.608 --> 31:28.000
I swear,

31:28.043 --> 31:30.347
I'm not lying.

31:38.043 --> 31:39.391
Thank you.

31:39.434 --> 31:40.869
Hospital where Mary's burn
was treated

31:40.913 --> 31:42.304
confirms she was in the ER

31:42.347 --> 31:44.260
the morning
of the warehouse fire.

31:44.304 --> 31:46.782
Jack Murdoch sent over
a list of civilian ships

31:46.826 --> 31:48.956
installed with
the questionable wiring.

31:49.000 --> 31:51.565
No reported problems over
the last four years.

31:51.608 --> 31:54.478
One of them could be
the arsonist's next target.

31:54.521 --> 31:57.086
Perhaps, but we still
do not have a motive.

31:57.130 --> 31:59.000
Corporate espionage?

31:59.043 --> 32:00.826
Maybe a personal vendetta
within the company?

32:00.869 --> 32:03.000
Or none of the above.

32:03.043 --> 32:04.913
We missing something, boss?

32:04.956 --> 32:06.130
Yeah.

32:06.173 --> 32:09.304
How any of this connects
to the damn Navy.

32:09.347 --> 32:12.130
TONY:
Well, we haven't really heard
from Abby in a while.

32:12.173 --> 32:15.260
Maybe she and Jason
found something?

32:18.391 --> 32:19.869
[phone ringing]

32:24.043 --> 32:26.000
ABBY:
Gibbs, can you come to the lab?

32:26.043 --> 32:27.782
Yeah, Abbs.

32:27.826 --> 32:30.434
I'll be right down.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.478
[chuckles]

32:35.521 --> 32:38.304
It's a gift.

32:39.347 --> 32:41.086
What's cooking, Abbs?

32:41.130 --> 32:42.782
Our special ingredient.

32:42.826 --> 32:44.608
Ammonium phosphate,
to be specific.

32:44.652 --> 32:47.217
After 47 attempts,
we finally determined

32:47.260 --> 32:49.043
that our killer has been
mixing thermite with...

32:49.086 --> 32:50.869
Wait, don't ruin the surprise.

32:50.913 --> 32:53.782
Okay, guess what has

32:53.826 --> 32:56.217
ammonium phosphate as
its key ingredient?

32:56.260 --> 32:57.434
Beer nuts.

32:57.478 --> 32:59.173
Fire retardant.
Wait.

32:59.217 --> 33:01.130
Fire retardant.

33:01.173 --> 33:03.826
It's genius. Get it?

33:03.869 --> 33:05.043
No.

33:05.086 --> 33:06.956
Okay, the retardant coats

33:07.000 --> 33:08.869
the aluminum particles,

33:08.913 --> 33:11.739
it slows down the chemical
reaction in the thermite.

33:11.782 --> 33:13.956
See, there's no holes this time.

33:14.000 --> 33:16.043
So, you get all of the power
and no unnecessary damage.

33:16.086 --> 33:19.391
This is a controlled burn.

33:19.434 --> 33:21.043
This helps track our killer?

33:21.086 --> 33:22.608
That's the very
best part.

33:22.652 --> 33:24.782
JASON:
The brand of retardant
our arsonist used

33:24.826 --> 33:28.000
is sold exclusively
to the U.S. Forest Service.

33:28.043 --> 33:31.043
You have to buy that from
the manufacturer directly.

33:31.086 --> 33:32.956
So we have a record
of who bought it.

33:33.000 --> 33:34.521
ABBY:
With photo IDs.

33:34.565 --> 33:35.956
We've been cross-checking
the faces

33:36.000 --> 33:38.739
against the Baltimore PD
database of known arsonists.

33:38.782 --> 33:39.869
[computer chiming]

33:43.217 --> 33:47.173
Well, meet Bruce Johnson.

33:47.217 --> 33:48.869

33:48.913 --> 33:50.869
He's the fire department
site inspector.

33:50.913 --> 33:52.869
Typically a
civilian position.

33:52.913 --> 33:55.391
He must've been an imposter,
a poser.

33:55.434 --> 33:57.869
Well, he's been a suspect
in several arsons for hire.

33:57.913 --> 34:00.217
None of them were proven.

34:00.260 --> 34:01.565
I guess if you have a...

34:01.608 --> 34:03.913

a Photoshopped ID...

34:03.956 --> 34:05.695

34:05.739 --> 34:08.304
There're nearly 2,000
firefighters in the department.

34:10.347 --> 34:11.913
I missed it.

34:11.956 --> 34:13.130
I-I'm sorry,
Agent Gibbs.

34:13.173 --> 34:15.043
Abbs, what's the last
known address for him?

34:15.086 --> 34:17.739
Um, I'll send it to McGee.

34:19.652 --> 34:21.608
He's not happy, is he?

34:21.652 --> 34:24.000
Well, he's...

34:24.043 --> 34:25.391
Hey.

Get out of the car.

34:53.608 --> 34:55.173
I want a deal.

34:55.217 --> 34:57.347
Turn it off, we'll talk.

34:57.391 --> 34:59.608
Look, the guy who hired me

34:59.652 --> 35:02.521
said Plimpton had information
about some bum wiring.

35:02.565 --> 35:04.739
I didn't mean to kill him,
but the bastard wouldn't talk.

35:04.782 --> 35:06.347
Who hired you?

35:08.608 --> 35:11.173
Do we have a deal?

35:11.217 --> 35:13.000
Turn off the car!

35:25.826 --> 35:27.130
GIBBS:
Get down!

35:27.173 --> 35:28.695
The car's gonna blow.

35:51.217 --> 35:53.217
Here you go.Thanks.

turn it off to go boom.

36:01.521 --> 36:02.956
ZIVA:
Gibbs, I found this inside.

36:03.000 --> 36:06.478
The missing file from
the United Equinox warehouse.

36:07.521 --> 36:09.260
GIBBS:
Well, it's a list.

36:09.304 --> 36:10.652
Of what?

36:10.695 --> 36:13.217
Every Navy warship that contains
the faulty wiring.

36:13.260 --> 36:15.173
They did sell it to the Navy.

36:15.217 --> 36:17.347
The guy from United Equinox
lied to us.

36:17.391 --> 36:19.782
Geek bastard.

36:19.826 --> 36:21.695
What?

36:21.739 --> 36:23.478
When Plimpton discovered
the wiring was faulty,

36:23.521 --> 36:25.695
he also sent a copy of his memo
to the Navy.

36:25.739 --> 36:28.173
Current Watcher Fleet's
been working with the Navy

36:28.217 --> 36:29.521
to fix the problem.

36:29.565 --> 36:31.304
Using its top-secret
code name Aquamarine.

36:31.347 --> 36:32.521
But...

36:32.565 --> 36:33.521
"But"?

36:33.565 --> 36:34.826
Only a third of the fleet

36:34.869 --> 36:36.521
has been retrofitted so far.

36:36.565 --> 36:38.434
So two-thirds are still at risk.

36:38.478 --> 36:42.000
Whoever hired our arsonist knows
how to attack U.S. warships.

36:42.043 --> 36:44.956
Blackmail? Corporate espionage?

36:46.000 --> 36:48.043

Yes, Admiral, but since
Director Vance is out of town...

36:57.782 --> 36:59.956
I'll have his detail notified,
sir.

37:00.000 --> 37:02.130
Uh-huh. Well, there is no
immediate cause for concern.

37:02.173 --> 37:04.565
If that changes,
we will keep you informed.

37:04.608 --> 37:07.086
No! Four cheese, four pepperoni
and four sausage.

37:07.130 --> 37:08.478
We've got a lot of agents
working late.

37:08.521 --> 37:09.695
Make 'em all
larges, DiNozzo.

37:09.739 --> 37:11.478
On it, boss.

37:11.521 --> 37:12.869
Director Vance
and Naval Command elements

37:12.913 --> 37:14.086

37:20.739 --> 37:23.217
Look, until we know
who's behind this,

37:23.260 --> 37:26.217
we have to believe that
they can hire somebody else.

37:26.260 --> 37:29.086
Boss, Aquamarine was kept
top secret to prevent anyone

37:29.130 --> 37:31.391
from exploiting the danger
to the fleet.

37:31.434 --> 37:34.347
So how did they
find out about it?

37:34.391 --> 37:36.521
GIBBS:
Good question.

37:36.565 --> 37:38.956
GIBBS:
DiNozzo?

37:43.347 --> 37:44.739
He doesn't see it, boss.

37:44.782 --> 37:46.000
Help him.

37:53.608 --> 37:55.086
Jason. Hey.

37:55.130 --> 37:56.782
Never got a chance
to say thanks.

37:56.826 --> 37:58.608
You saved my butt
on the cargo ship.

37:58.652 --> 38:00.086
I could have saved Johnson.

38:00.130 --> 38:02.217
He would've given us answers.

38:02.260 --> 38:03.869
No.

38:03.913 --> 38:05.260
It was too
late for that.

38:05.304 --> 38:06.478
No, you gave up.

38:06.521 --> 38:07.695

and there was nothing we
could have done that night.

38:28.260 --> 38:29.869
Wrong.
You could have tried.

38:29.913 --> 38:31.086
I did try.

[pushes stop button]Listen,

38:32.695 --> 38:37.434
I ran into a burning building
and dragged your ass out.

38:37.478 --> 38:39.260
You're welcome, by the way.

38:39.304 --> 38:41.869

the only one.

that night, Jason...

38:51.173 --> 38:54.173
you can't save them all.

38:54.217 --> 38:57.565
Sometimes...

38:57.608 --> 39:00.043
you have to pick one.

39:00.086 --> 39:01.913
I picked you.

39:01.956 --> 39:04.695
Otherwise all three
of us would have...

died that night,
and you know it.

I was supposed to be
taking care of her.

A lot of things
changed that night.

39:26.826 --> 39:29.565
I decided to become a cop

39:29.608 --> 39:34.652

lost in Baltimore...

39:34.695 --> 39:36.826
but didn't.

39:36.869 --> 39:40.826
And that's you.

39:40.869 --> 39:44.434
For the first time in my life,

39:44.478 --> 39:46.521
I made a difference.

39:46.565 --> 39:52.000
I did something
that mattered.

39:52.043 --> 39:55.826
I've been trying to
do that ever since.

39:56.869 --> 39:58.869
Me, too.

39:58.913 --> 40:02.304
I know.

40:02.347 --> 40:04.043
[pushes button]

40:04.086 --> 40:07.652
And look at what
you've become.

that they contained information

about the wiring flaws?

Well, I guess so.
