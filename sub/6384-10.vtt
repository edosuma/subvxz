00:43.110 --> 00:44.640
Wow.

00:44.670 --> 00:47.420
"Wow"? What does -- what
does that mean -- "wow"?

00:47.430 --> 00:49.420
- Oh, yeah.
- "Oh, yeah"?

00:49.430 --> 00:52.400
I see what you mean. You
got quite a lump here.

00:52.410 --> 00:54.820
- It's grotesque.
- Cancer?

00:54.830 --> 00:56.530
Not necessarily.

00:56.540 --> 00:58.980
What the fuck is it?

00:59.000 --> 01:02.290
One very angry and swollen lymph node.

01:02.310 --> 01:02.970
Down there?

01:02.990 --> 01:05.209
I keep telling him it's
probably nothing, right?

01:05.220 --> 01:08.050
Not necessarily.

01:10.160 --> 01:11.990
So, what are you working on these days?

01:12.020 --> 01:13.510
What am I working on?

01:13.540 --> 01:16.240
I'm working on trying to figure out
what that fucking lump in my junk is.

01:16.270 --> 01:17.260
That's what I'm working on.

01:17.270 --> 01:20.510
I say we biopsy that sucker.

01:20.520 --> 01:21.730
We'll do it right here, right now.

01:21.760 --> 01:25.820
I'd love to, but I got a lot of
important meetings and -- and --

01:25.850 --> 01:27.640
and appointments and such, so...

01:27.670 --> 01:29.080
I'm a very busy man. I got to run.

01:29.090 --> 01:31.270
Hank, you're doing this right now.

01:31.290 --> 01:33.560
Come on. It'll be fun.

01:33.570 --> 01:35.050
It won't hurt at all.

01:35.080 --> 01:37.850
Well, that's not true. It's gonna
hurt like hell -- especially down here.

01:37.860 --> 01:39.900
All right, but it's gonna
be quick, though, right?

01:39.910 --> 01:42.230
In the whole scheme of things? Sure.

01:42.240 --> 01:44.020
Over before you know it.

01:44.030 --> 01:46.110
Okay, h-hold up. H-h-hold
-- hold it. Hold it.

01:46.120 --> 01:47.890
I-is there time for me to get a drink?

01:47.920 --> 01:49.930
Can you send a man-nurse over
to gil turner's for a bottle?

01:49.950 --> 01:52.110
Can I get a drink?

01:52.130 --> 01:54.800
For you? Sure.

01:59.820 --> 02:05.050
The body of kurt cobain was found in a room above the
garage of his fashionable lake washington boulevard...

02:15.170 --> 02:19.150
What's wrong? Are you okay?

02:19.160 --> 02:22.090
Kurt cobain...

02:22.490 --> 02:25.140
- he's dead.
- What?

02:25.480 --> 02:26.910
What happened?

02:26.930 --> 02:29.290
Suicide.

02:29.880 --> 02:33.660
- Well, that's a fucking shame.
- Yeah.

02:35.330 --> 02:38.140
And I'm pregnant.

02:49.270 --> 02:50.740
ta-da! It's positive.

02:50.750 --> 02:51.960
As in?

02:51.970 --> 02:53.600
As in "I'm with child."

02:53.620 --> 02:55.380
What's so positive about that? Here.

02:55.390 --> 02:57.950
Have another one.
Look -- pee on this.

02:57.960 --> 02:58.900
- Hank.
- Pee on that.

02:58.910 --> 03:01.820
We've done three, okay?
I'm all out of pee.

03:01.830 --> 03:03.950
Then drink some water and
hydrate and pee on this.

03:03.960 --> 03:06.410
- I'm pregnant.
- I'm not convinced.

03:06.420 --> 03:09.250
This is happening. Fuck.

03:09.260 --> 03:11.800
The rabbit done died, huh?

03:11.810 --> 03:14.690
All right. Okay.

03:16.830 --> 03:19.480
What do we do now?

03:20.500 --> 03:24.600
Well, it's okay. I mean, you know,
I'll just take care of it, so...

03:25.110 --> 03:26.740
we'll take care of it.

03:26.750 --> 03:29.800
So that's it -- we've
decided? That's good. Yeah.

03:29.810 --> 03:32.030
Well-played, woman.

03:32.050 --> 03:37.620
I now feel entirely incapable of
giving you the right answer here.

03:37.630 --> 03:41.140
Well, no. I mean, jesus christ, hank,
we barely know each other, right?

03:41.150 --> 03:43.060
You -- you got
a girlfriend.

03:43.070 --> 03:44.880
Oh, come on. It's a loose arrangement.

03:44.890 --> 03:47.080
The waify models are
good that way, you know?

03:47.110 --> 03:49.490
And you have a boyfriend.

03:49.530 --> 03:51.880
Let's not forget that
important little factoid.

03:51.890 --> 03:55.300
I have a boyfriend who's on tour
-- a boyfriend I never see --

03:55.330 --> 03:58.010
a boyfriend I think less and less about.

03:58.030 --> 04:00.490
All right, look.I don't
want to be insensitive,

04:00.510 --> 04:05.710
all right, but are we entirely
sure that this is my doing?

04:06.940 --> 04:10.350
Yep. We seem pretty sure. Okay.

04:10.670 --> 04:12.600
Most likely, it's nothing.

04:12.610 --> 04:14.750
But what could it be?

04:14.760 --> 04:18.160
it's hard to say. You could
have a nasty infection somewhere.

04:18.170 --> 04:20.420
Well, that sounds very manageable.

04:20.430 --> 04:23.610
Absolutely. We could probably knock
that out with a dose of antibiotics.

04:23.620 --> 04:25.300
Great. What else?

04:25.310 --> 04:27.240
It could very well be an std.

04:27.270 --> 04:29.750
- No, I don't think so.
- Oh, really?

04:29.760 --> 04:30.410
What else?

04:30.420 --> 04:33.220
No, let's stay in this
arena. I want to know more.

04:33.230 --> 04:36.030
Well, syphilis is a big
one. It's on the rise.

04:36.040 --> 04:37.600
- Syphilis.
- Syphilis? Syphilis?

04:37.610 --> 04:38.910
Do you hear that?
That's -- that's nice.

04:38.920 --> 04:41.000
I-I don't see any reason
that we would assume that.

04:41.010 --> 04:42.630
It could be cancer.

04:42.660 --> 04:43.740
It could be. You never know.

04:43.750 --> 04:45.200
Well, that's better than syphilis.

04:45.210 --> 04:48.270
Woman, what is wrong with you?
You'd rather I have cancer?

04:51.910 --> 04:53.650
We've got to talk about options.

04:53.660 --> 04:55.800
Well, I don't have any
pamphlets or literature on me,

04:55.820 --> 05:00.280
but you strike me as a painfully
liberal, pro-choice kind of a gal.

05:00.290 --> 05:02.110
Who, me?

05:02.130 --> 05:04.390
Oh, my god, no. I'm ultraconservative.

05:04.400 --> 05:07.010
Like N.R.A.,
Pro-life, the whole --

05:07.030 --> 05:08.200
- really?
- Yeah.

05:08.210 --> 05:12.550
That really limits our options, but
let's sit with that for a moment.

05:12.580 --> 05:18.000
Seriously, I have been on a kind of
non-abortion streak my whole life,

05:18.020 --> 05:21.010
and I feel kind of good
about that, you know?

05:21.020 --> 05:23.530
Yeah. I-I-I get
that. I get it.

05:23.540 --> 05:27.010
But do you really, uh -- really
want to have a child right now?

05:27.020 --> 05:31.150
No, not really. You do, right?

05:31.160 --> 05:33.990
No. God, no. I mean, i am a child.

05:34.000 --> 05:40.600
A fairly big one, you know, but when children
have children, I-I-it never works out for anyone.

05:40.610 --> 05:41.800
- Especially me.
- Right.

05:41.810 --> 05:47.660
I could see it might seriously hamper your
ability to drink and get laid on a nightly basis.

05:47.680 --> 05:50.720
Oh, no. Don't worry about that. I
can multitask with the best of 'em.

05:50.730 --> 05:53.290
Good to know.

05:53.300 --> 05:55.910
I'm sorry that I knocked you up.

05:55.920 --> 05:57.490
It's almost rude, right?

05:57.530 --> 06:00.180
I mean, you're kind enough
to grant me access to your --

06:00.190 --> 06:02.710
your most intimate of
areas, and what do I do?

06:02.720 --> 06:04.390
I pollinate that shit.

06:04.410 --> 06:07.550
I really wish that one of us
would have insisted on a rubber.

06:07.560 --> 06:08.840
One of us did.

06:08.850 --> 06:10.490
- Well, n-not this
one. - This one.

06:10.500 --> 06:13.160
Well, I mean, let's not
get all rashomon on it.

06:13.170 --> 06:14.710
If I
re-- okay.

06:14.720 --> 06:18.010
- Well, no, maybe I didn't insist hard enough.
- Thank you.

06:18.020 --> 06:20.480
Okay, I'm not gonna
press charges anymore.

06:20.500 --> 06:22.860
Oh, wonderful. You see? Look at this.

06:22.870 --> 06:26.640
We get along really well for
a couple of virtual strangers.

06:26.650 --> 06:33.190
For now, yeah, but give it 10 years, and I'll just
be another woman that you got tired of fucking.

06:34.480 --> 06:38.780
You know, in 10 years time, you might
very well be the love of my life.

06:41.040 --> 06:42.570
What are you doing?

06:42.590 --> 06:44.060
He said today, you know?

06:44.070 --> 06:45.380
He said maybe today.

06:45.400 --> 06:47.000
Today is today.

06:47.010 --> 06:49.980
Hank. Will you stop
it? It's gonna be okay.

06:49.990 --> 06:51.040
You don't know that.

06:51.080 --> 06:56.360
Well, I do, because whatever happens,
you know, we'll get through it.

06:56.380 --> 06:57.910
I'm -- I'm
gonna help you.

06:57.930 --> 06:59.500
But I-I-it's
not your problem.

06:59.510 --> 07:02.230
We're not even together right now, so...

07:02.240 --> 07:05.480
I forgot what a hypochondriac
drama queen you can be.

07:05.500 --> 07:08.610
Well, you're not the one who just
had a biopsy done on your cock.

07:08.630 --> 07:10.520
That's 'cause I don't have a cock.

07:10.530 --> 07:12.340
Thank the lord for that.

07:12.390 --> 07:13.550
Anyway, it wasn't on your cock.

07:13.560 --> 07:18.010
Yeah, I know, but I-I consider that
whole area -- general area -- my cock.

07:18.040 --> 07:21.140
Like, from my knees
to my nipples -- cock.

07:21.180 --> 07:25.320
Right, well, he said it was probably
just a swollen lymph node, remember?

07:25.340 --> 07:26.610
I-it could be cancer.

07:26.640 --> 07:28.090
It could be syphilis.

07:28.100 --> 07:29.260
Oh, shit. Yeah.

07:29.270 --> 07:32.880
I could wind up a blind, dickless
beggar working a 405 off-ramp.

07:32.910 --> 07:35.180
Stop by and say hi sometime.

07:36.360 --> 07:37.690
look who's here.

07:37.720 --> 07:38.710
Hey, honey.

07:38.730 --> 07:40.860
Are you okay?

07:40.870 --> 07:42.730
Yeah, sure. Yes. Why?

07:42.740 --> 07:44.620
Because you're here.

07:44.630 --> 07:46.570
You've been sleeping over.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.820
Which could mean you guys
are getting back together.

07:49.830 --> 07:52.380
Or it could mean something's wrong.

07:52.410 --> 07:57.450
Either way, someone should grow a
pair and tell me what's going on.

07:58.660 --> 08:00.800
We're not getting back together.

08:00.810 --> 08:03.530
And everything's fine.

08:03.560 --> 08:06.300
Liars!

08:09.050 --> 08:11.820
Seriously.

08:11.830 --> 08:14.120
What do you want to do?

08:14.150 --> 08:15.140
It's totally up to me?

08:15.160 --> 08:18.470
In a -- in
a way, it is.

08:18.950 --> 08:22.050
Okay, well, I'm just gonna
deal with it, you know?

08:22.060 --> 08:25.980
I don't really want to have
a baby right now, and...

08:25.990 --> 08:28.670
Judging by that huge exhalation...

08:29.270 --> 08:30.830
neither do you.

08:30.840 --> 08:33.220
So... that's it.

08:33.230 --> 08:37.020
But we can't see each
other anymore, hank.

08:37.039 --> 08:38.799
This is no way to start a relationship.

08:38.820 --> 08:40.419
We're both cheating on people, hank.

08:40.440 --> 08:43.440
It kind of sucks. I
don't want to do that.

08:43.450 --> 08:47.330
So, you go, you know, take care of
your shit, and I'll take care of mine,

08:47.350 --> 08:51.720
and if and when you
want, you could call me.

08:51.730 --> 08:54.750
That's -- that's -- that's not the
way it works in the big ol' world.

08:54.760 --> 08:58.160
People have a tendency
to lose one another.

08:58.190 --> 09:02.300
Well, if that's what happens,
then it wasn't meant to be, right?

09:10.010 --> 09:12.880
Could you stop surfing the
internet for a diagnosis?

09:12.900 --> 09:15.990
No way. I know what I
have without question.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.150
What?

09:17.190 --> 09:20.330
Apparently, I have the bubonic plague.

09:21.190 --> 09:23.350
Well, guess what? I have just the cure.

09:23.360 --> 09:27.490
I'm gonna offer you... a service. Yeah.

09:27.500 --> 09:29.190
Cancer-scare mercy fuck?

09:29.210 --> 09:32.110
You know, I-I-I'm
gonna pass.

09:32.130 --> 09:33.460
- You're gonna pass?
- Yeah.

09:33.470 --> 09:36.840
- You are?
- I don't want you to be insulted, but...

09:36.850 --> 09:38.910
that's okay. I can take it.

09:39.590 --> 09:41.250
I'm gonna go take a shower.

09:41.270 --> 09:43.810
Whoa, can I ask you,
before you go, a question?

09:43.820 --> 09:46.130
I'm offering you sex,
and you want to talk?

09:46.140 --> 09:47.920
Has the earth spun off its axis?

09:47.930 --> 09:50.330
It's just, you said that
thing the other day, you know?

09:50.350 --> 09:52.620
- What thing?
- About ashby.

09:53.290 --> 09:54.730
- What do you mean?
- What do you mean, what do I mean?

09:54.740 --> 09:56.980
You said that very loaded thing
about him being a great kisser,

09:57.010 --> 09:59.880
which kind of sounded like a joke
and kind of not at the same time.

09:59.890 --> 10:02.610
Well, it kind of was a joke and
it kind of wasn't at the same time.

10:02.640 --> 10:04.430
I mean, he did kiss me.

10:04.440 --> 10:05.620
He's a fucking asshole.

10:05.640 --> 10:08.900
No, not an asshole. He's a child.

10:08.910 --> 10:12.810
He wants what he wants, and he can't
understand if he doesn't get it.

10:12.830 --> 10:15.950
He'S... kind of similar
to someone else I know.

10:15.960 --> 10:17.990
There should be a lot
of empathy right there.

10:18.000 --> 10:19.760
You didn't answer my question.

10:19.780 --> 10:20.940
What was the question?

10:20.960 --> 10:22.150
Is this something I need to worry about?

10:22.160 --> 10:23.840
Is there something going on?

10:23.850 --> 10:26.010
Oh, please.

10:26.020 --> 10:28.210
Don't you have enough
to worry about right now?

10:28.230 --> 10:31.620
Will you please stop answering
my questions with a question?

10:31.640 --> 10:33.890
Well, then stop asking me questions.

10:33.920 --> 10:37.080
You said it -- we're
not together right now.

10:37.090 --> 10:40.860
So I don't owe you any explanation.

11:28.400 --> 11:31.660
Come on, buddy. Everybody has
a scare or two in their life.

11:31.670 --> 11:36.020
You remember when they took that gnarly skin
tag off the base of my scrotum that time?

11:36.030 --> 11:37.330
That amused you greatly.

11:37.350 --> 11:39.440
Well, skin tags are inherently amusing.

11:39.450 --> 11:41.140
Yes, and disgusting.

11:41.160 --> 11:45.050
It's the runkle family
curse. Mad skin tags, baby.

11:45.060 --> 11:47.580
You make me want to die.

11:48.270 --> 11:52.340
Anyway, I remember I sweated
that phone call for days, man.

11:52.370 --> 11:53.810
You know, waiting for the results.

11:53.830 --> 11:57.130
Marcy finally had to bitch-slap
some sense into me at one point.

11:57.170 --> 11:59.170
You will be okay.

11:59.190 --> 12:00.780
That's what everybody
says -- "you'll be okay."

12:00.810 --> 12:03.400
And then one day, the phone
rings, and you're not okay.

12:03.420 --> 12:06.110
Well, yeah. There's that.

12:06.120 --> 12:11.520
Hey, look on the bright side -- that girl
seems to be eye-raping you over there.

12:12.730 --> 12:15.920
Well, who cares? You know how much
time I've wasted on that fucking dance?

12:15.930 --> 12:17.990
Time that I could've spent
hanging with my daughter?

12:18.000 --> 12:20.870
You are a great father.

12:20.900 --> 12:23.410
No! I'm a father. I am not great.

12:23.420 --> 12:24.870
A great father
is a guy that --

12:24.920 --> 12:29.240
that gives it all up for his family and leaves
his self-destructive bullshit at the door.

12:29.260 --> 12:31.540
The self-loathing is strong
in you today, my friend.

12:31.550 --> 12:32.550
I'm just like my father.

12:32.580 --> 12:36.930
You know, there isn't a woman that I've met that I
haven't fallen in love with for 10 minutes or 10 years.

12:36.960 --> 12:39.780
What about the one woman
that threw it in with me?

12:39.800 --> 12:41.960
Took that massive leap of
faith just to be with me?

12:41.980 --> 12:43.500
What did I do? I fucked that up.

12:43.510 --> 12:45.800
- You gave it a shot, man.
- Did I?

12:45.810 --> 12:46.500
Yeah.

12:46.520 --> 12:49.650
Did I do my absotte bes or did I
just want someone I didn't have?

12:49.670 --> 12:52.490
Is the chase better than the catch?

12:52.520 --> 12:57.340
And other some such
clichéd, masculine bullshit.

12:57.350 --> 13:00.070
There is no absolute best, hank.

13:00.100 --> 13:04.460
You know, I really envy
your relationship with marce.

13:04.490 --> 13:10.050
You know, it'S... it's like it's
indestructible, you know -- teflon marriage.

13:10.060 --> 13:12.680
Maybe. Doesn't mean I don't want things.

13:12.690 --> 13:15.160
Yeah, but you know what you have.

13:15.180 --> 13:16.890
I don't know...

13:16.920 --> 13:22.480
faced with my own mortality,
I might rather be elsewhere...

13:22.820 --> 13:24.280
with daisy maybe.

13:24.300 --> 13:27.100
That's just the mindfuck of the
fresh. It's -- it's an illusion.

13:27.110 --> 13:29.910
That's just new pussy talking to you.

13:29.940 --> 13:32.400
What if it's not, huh?

13:32.430 --> 13:35.690
Runkle, you better
watch your fucking ass

13:35.710 --> 13:39.600
or I will have your balls
-- skin tags and all.

13:42.130 --> 13:43.470
Doctor?

13:43.510 --> 13:47.290
No. It's ashby. Fuck him.

14:20.740 --> 14:22.540
Uh, you want me to
leave the water running?

14:22.560 --> 14:25.710
There's still some hot left.

14:27.970 --> 14:30.640
Yeah, okay, okay.

14:31.360 --> 14:35.140
Hey, beautiful. What's up with
moody? Haven't seen him for days.

14:35.150 --> 14:38.720
He's not picking up,
returning my calls. He okay?

14:38.730 --> 14:42.490
Yeah. Yeah, he... no.

14:42.500 --> 14:44.500
He's got some stuff going on.

14:44.510 --> 14:46.180
Anything I can do?

14:46.190 --> 14:50.960
n-no.I mean, you know,

14:50.970 --> 14:54.090
he kind of wants to know what's
going on with us, which is, like...

14:54.100 --> 14:55.570
- oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

14:55.580 --> 14:56.810
What is going on with us?

14:56.820 --> 15:01.000
I-I-I told him you were a great kisser,
which was -- which was kind of dumb.

15:01.020 --> 15:04.660
Well, that is somewhat incendiary.

15:04.890 --> 15:06.730
And yet completely true.

15:06.740 --> 15:08.860
I wouldn't know.

15:08.880 --> 15:11.400
No, he -- it kind
of pissed him off.

15:11.410 --> 15:13.800
Really? You don't say?

15:13.810 --> 15:15.630
Right.

15:15.660 --> 15:20.720
You know, I was seeing this guy when I first
met hank, and he kind of reminds me of you.

15:20.740 --> 15:21.770
- Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

15:21.780 --> 15:22.900
What was he like?

15:22.910 --> 15:24.980
He -- he
was simple.

15:24.990 --> 15:27.500
"Simple"? Like, uh... retarded?

15:27.510 --> 15:31.600
Yeah. No. No, good. Really good simple.

15:31.610 --> 15:37.430
I mean, he was -- he loved
music, he -- he smiled a lot.

15:37.440 --> 15:41.100
Stop it. Kind of like he
had the secret, you know?

15:41.110 --> 15:42.530
Which is what?

15:42.540 --> 15:44.990
I guess...

15:45.020 --> 15:48.710
Take the thing you love
and make it your life.

15:50.010 --> 15:51.380
So, we should kiss?

15:51.420 --> 15:55.070
No. Are you insane?
Do you have no memory?

15:55.080 --> 15:58.390
- Fucker!
- Hank, no!

15:59.740 --> 16:04.300
Hank! God! Hank, stop!

16:04.730 --> 16:06.830
Oh, shit! God!

16:06.840 --> 16:09.830
Okay! Okay!

16:12.240 --> 16:15.250
Okay. I'm out.

16:16.610 --> 16:18.690
Bitch!

16:18.700 --> 16:21.100
What are you doing?

16:22.570 --> 16:26.170
Come on. You're behaving like a child.

16:26.650 --> 16:28.190
Moody!

16:28.200 --> 16:31.340
Hank! Get off of him!

16:31.350 --> 16:35.330
Hank moody, dr. Reiss calling.
Give me a call at the office.

16:35.340 --> 16:38.790
Hello? Hello?

16:40.330 --> 16:43.000
Fuck!

16:43.430 --> 16:45.340
Peace.

16:45.350 --> 16:49.470
That's great, marce. Yes.
I accept your apology.

16:49.480 --> 16:53.540
I'm all for the 12 steps. Love
'em. Can't get enough of 'em.

16:53.550 --> 16:56.090
Wish there were more.

16:56.100 --> 16:59.040
Sounds great.

16:59.050 --> 17:02.040
Can't wait to see you.

17:02.050 --> 17:04.930
Love you, too, baby. Bye.

17:10.060 --> 17:12.550
"Hey" yourself.

17:12.560 --> 17:15.180
I thought I might find you here.

17:15.200 --> 17:16.960
Well, you could've just called.

17:16.990 --> 17:19.940
Oh, I just didn't want
to do this over the phone.

17:19.960 --> 17:22.540
I found a place.

17:22.550 --> 17:24.760
So you're moving out?

17:24.780 --> 17:26.230
It's a cute place.

17:26.250 --> 17:28.610
It's, uh -- it's just a single,
but it's in santa monica.

17:28.650 --> 17:32.550
It's pretty close to the
water and close to yoga.

17:33.790 --> 17:36.100
There's something else
I wanted to tell you.

17:36.140 --> 17:38.090
And I hope you're not mad.

17:38.140 --> 17:41.940
But I don't want to do any more porn.

17:41.980 --> 17:45.150
- I think I'm out.
- Really?

17:45.520 --> 17:47.830
But you're so good at it.

17:47.840 --> 17:50.460
I don't know, "vaginatown" was special.

17:50.480 --> 17:53.910
I mean, this whole thing was special.

17:53.930 --> 17:57.480
And, you know, if I can't
actually be with you, charlie...

17:57.490 --> 18:02.690
I'd kind of like the last person
I had on-screen sex with to be you.

18:03.680 --> 18:07.940
That's, like, one of the nicest
things anyone's ever said to me.

18:07.960 --> 18:12.060
And yet totally gross for you.

18:14.000 --> 18:15.720
What are you gonna do?

18:15.740 --> 18:18.230
Temp, waitress...

18:18.240 --> 18:20.360
but I'm gonna take acting classes...

18:20.380 --> 18:22.240
and maybe some improv.

18:22.270 --> 18:24.330
I know I've got an
uphill battle ahead of me.

18:24.370 --> 18:25.410
What with the fisting and all.

18:25.430 --> 18:26.520
- Exactly.
- Yeah.

18:26.530 --> 18:29.310
But it's worth it 'cause
I really want this.

18:29.620 --> 18:32.500
Well, I'll still manage
you if you'll have me.

18:32.520 --> 18:35.230
Are you sure that's such a good idea?

18:35.240 --> 18:39.390
No. But, uh...

18:39.870 --> 18:44.180
the thought of never seeing you again
sounds like a much, much worse idea.

18:46.560 --> 18:50.500
Um, maybe I could, uh,
see your place sometime.

18:50.510 --> 18:53.080
I'd like that.

18:54.630 --> 18:58.900
Maybe I could see it... now.

18:58.910 --> 19:02.270
Well, I'd like that even more.

19:06.550 --> 19:07.810
Sorry about your cock.

19:07.840 --> 19:10.090
It's not my cock.

19:10.100 --> 19:13.520
Doesn't matter. You should have told me. I
trained as a paramedic. I could've helped.

19:13.530 --> 19:15.750
Oh, yeah? Like how?

19:16.380 --> 19:18.550
I don't know. I could've...

19:18.560 --> 19:21.150
felt around, put your mind at ease.

19:21.160 --> 19:23.660
Maybe next time.

19:23.670 --> 19:27.850
Look, I'm sorry I kissed your old lady.

19:27.860 --> 19:29.120
I'm sorry I kissed yours.

19:29.150 --> 19:31.110
You fucking asshole. Did you penetrate?

19:31.120 --> 19:32.220
Did I go inside? No.

19:32.230 --> 19:36.110
Friends don't let friends
bang each other's soul mates.

19:36.120 --> 19:39.100
"A-fucking-men"
to that.

19:39.660 --> 19:42.470
Be good.

19:45.540 --> 19:46.600
Sorry about the mess.

19:46.630 --> 19:48.560
It's okay.

19:48.580 --> 19:51.380
Hank, you're my best friend.

19:51.400 --> 19:55.030
I would never, ever fuck
someone to get back at you.

19:55.050 --> 19:56.390
I know. That's the thing.

19:56.400 --> 20:00.900
If you fuck someone, you really want
to fuck them. That's what scares me.

20:00.910 --> 20:02.490
Well, what do you really want?

20:02.510 --> 20:04.420
I mean, how do you want this to end?

20:04.440 --> 20:08.130
I want to keep doing this for
as much time as we have left.

20:08.160 --> 20:12.030
Not -- not
cleaning up. This.

20:12.580 --> 20:15.880
Isn't that, like, what we've been doing?

20:15.920 --> 20:17.320
Well, I don't know if we have.

20:17.350 --> 20:22.870
I mean, w-we've talked about it endlessly, and
we've listed all the reasons why it's not possible,

20:22.890 --> 20:25.780
but what if all those reasons
just magically went away?

20:25.800 --> 20:29.030
That's the problem
-- they never do.

20:29.040 --> 20:32.570
Okay, you've got one month left.
What do you do? How do you spend it?

20:32.580 --> 20:33.930
With becca.

20:33.960 --> 20:35.320
No hank in there?

20:35.330 --> 20:39.490
I don't fit in anywhere
in there? No -- no hank?

20:40.060 --> 20:41.560
Maybe a couple of days.

20:41.580 --> 20:44.620
Fair enough, but for me...

20:44.650 --> 20:47.330
I want you there at the end.

20:47.340 --> 20:50.980
I want those eyes to be
the last thing that I see.

20:53.380 --> 20:56.700
- You know what it is about lew?
- No. I don'T.

20:56.710 --> 20:59.100
He made a choice. He chose art.

20:59.110 --> 21:02.910
He made that his life. And
that's okay. That's valid.

21:02.920 --> 21:05.510
But with you...

21:06.190 --> 21:09.580
you can't figure out who
you want to be, you know?

21:09.610 --> 21:13.700
It's your indecision that
paralyzes you and hurts us, hank.

21:13.730 --> 21:16.740
I can feel your restlessness.

21:16.770 --> 21:19.680
I mean, a moment like this,
yeah, you want me, you want us.

21:19.720 --> 21:24.140
And then that moment passes,
and you become like this ghost.

21:24.180 --> 21:27.400
14 years ago, "I love
you" was more than enough.

21:27.410 --> 21:30.950
I mean, it was almost revolutionary.

21:30.990 --> 21:35.730
And now... I don't
know. They're just words.

21:36.160 --> 21:38.980
I mean, I know you mean them, but...

21:39.210 --> 21:43.260
hank, I-I don't know
what they mean to you.

21:47.910 --> 21:50.970
You want to be saved?

21:57.770 --> 22:00.100
Hello?

22:00.120 --> 22:04.420
Hey, dr. Reiss. How are you?

22:06.470 --> 22:12.020
Okay. All right. Well... thank you.

22:13.720 --> 22:15.820
- What?
- You were right.

22:15.830 --> 22:18.990
- What?
- Syphilis.

22:19.000 --> 22:22.840
- Bullshit.
- It's benign. You know, just, uh...

22:22.850 --> 22:26.100
antibiotics is all I
need, and then, uh...

22:26.110 --> 22:27.300
I-I'm gonna be okay.

22:27.320 --> 22:30.830
That's fantastic. You're okay.

22:30.840 --> 22:33.590
For now.

22:37.340 --> 22:39.380
- Want to give me that,
- No.

22:39.390 --> 22:43.210
- Post-cancer-scare mercy
fuck now? - No. It's too late.

22:47.180 --> 22:50.150
So, this is it, I guess, huh?

22:52.830 --> 22:55.690
I guess so. Yeah.

22:55.700 --> 22:57.140
Can I call you?

22:57.150 --> 23:00.980
No. No, really, I'd rather you didn'T.

23:00.990 --> 23:03.820
Well, will you call
me, you know, just to...

23:03.830 --> 23:06.100
let me know you're okay?

23:06.120 --> 23:09.120
Yeah. I'll call you.

23:09.440 --> 23:13.350
No, you won'T... but I get it.

23:13.850 --> 23:16.900
It was, uh... it was, uh...

23:16.910 --> 23:22.570
it was awfully nice sharing this most
unpleasant of milestones with you.

23:22.870 --> 23:25.510
Yeah. Same here.

23:27.350 --> 23:30.700
Don't get lost out there, okay?

24:01.010 --> 24:03.430
hank!

24:06.500 --> 24:12.270
I-I was gonna go check out
that vigil of, um, kurt cobain.

24:13.620 --> 24:16.090
I-I don't know. Did you want to come?

24:16.100 --> 24:18.320
- The cobain vigil?
- Yeah.

24:18.330 --> 24:22.910
Well, I got a vigil
that I was already...

24:22.920 --> 24:25.690
- no, seriously. Yeah?
- Yeah.

24:26.120 --> 24:30.910
I don't know if you know this
about me, but, uh, i love vigils.

24:30.940 --> 24:34.590
I kind of guessed that.

24:34.800 --> 24:36.110
Dear, karen...

24:36.130 --> 24:39.890
if you're reading this, it means I
actually worked up the courage to mail it.

24:39.900 --> 24:42.640
So, good for me.

24:42.650 --> 24:44.810
You don't know me very
wel but you get me started,

24:44.830 --> 24:49.550
I have a tendency to go on and on
about how hard the writing is for me.

24:49.570 --> 24:51.560
But this...

24:51.570 --> 24:54.920
this is the hardest thing
I've ever had to write.

24:55.440 --> 24:58.250
There's no easy way to say
this, so I'll just say it.

24:58.270 --> 25:01.470
I met someone. It was an accident.

25:01.480 --> 25:03.940
I wasn't looking for
it. I wasn't on the make.

25:03.950 --> 25:07.960
It was a perfect storm. She
said one thing. I said another.

25:07.970 --> 25:12.480
Next thing I knew, I wanted to spend the rest
of my life in the middle of that conversation.

25:14.940 --> 25:17.170
now there's this feeling in my gut.

25:17.200 --> 25:19.430
She might be the one.

25:19.450 --> 25:21.180
She's completely nuts...

25:21.210 --> 25:24.470
in a way that makes me
smile -- highly neurotic.

25:25.310 --> 25:28.070
A great deal of maintenance required.

25:28.080 --> 25:30.970
She is you, karen.

25:30.980 --> 25:34.330
That's the good news.

25:34.660 --> 25:38.410
The bad is that I don't know
how to be with you right now.

25:38.430 --> 25:40.720
And it scares the shit out of me.

25:40.740 --> 25:45.910
Because if I'm not with you right now, I
have this feeling we'll get lost out there.

25:48.330 --> 25:51.660
It's a big, bad world
full of twists and turns,

25:51.690 --> 25:55.680
and people have a way of
blinking and missing the moment...

25:56.380 --> 25:59.960
the moment that could've
changed everything.

25:59.970 --> 26:03.350
I don't know what's going on with us,

26:03.370 --> 26:07.920
and I can't tell you why you should waste
a leap of faith on the likes of me...

26:09.870 --> 26:13.350
but, damn, you smell
good -- like home.

26:13.380 --> 26:15.170
And you make excellent coffee.

26:15.180 --> 26:18.570
That's got to count
for something, right?

26:18.580 --> 26:20.550
Call me.

26:20.560 --> 26:24.090
Unfaithfully yours, hank moody.
