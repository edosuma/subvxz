(barking continues)

00:18.910 --> 00:20.820

00:20.880 --> 00:22.550
(breathing heavily)

00:28.220 --> 00:29.690
(engines revving)

00:29.760 --> 00:31.160
(tires screeching)

00:36.730 --> 00:37.670
(tires screeching)

00:40.740 --> 00:42.040
(tires screeching)

00:52.850 --> 00:53.780
Find it.

00:55.850 --> 00:56.790
(grunting)

00:59.760 --> 01:02.430
Alas... it has come
to this, Mr. Chang.

01:06.260 --> 01:07.600
(weapon powering up)

01:07.660 --> 01:10.530
What a dreary setting
for your final stand.

01:12.270 --> 01:13.540
(clunking)

01:13.600 --> 01:15.300
How long have
you been running?

01:16.470 --> 01:17.710
Are you not tired?

01:19.840 --> 01:21.380
Be reasonable.

01:21.440 --> 01:24.250
Give me the amulet
and walk away.

01:25.450 --> 01:26.720
I'll even
pay you for your troubles.

01:28.020 --> 01:29.020
(gasping)

01:29.150 --> 01:30.490
(man)
A king's fortune.

01:30.550 --> 01:31.490
Sorry.

01:32.860 --> 01:34.190
Idiot.

01:34.260 --> 01:37.390
You see, I am not
a cruel man, Chang.

01:38.490 --> 01:40.500
I have no wish to
shed blood.

01:41.700 --> 01:44.900
But do not
take this to mean...

01:44.970 --> 01:46.070
I won't.

01:46.170 --> 01:48.170
(weapon powering up)

01:48.170 --> 01:49.340
(groaning)

01:55.480 --> 01:57.450
(breathing heavily)

01:57.510 --> 02:00.320
So nice of you
to drop in.

02:00.380 --> 02:02.490
I think it's
fair to say, Mr. Chang,

02:02.550 --> 02:04.590
the amulet is finally mine.

02:08.560 --> 02:09.960
Time to let it go.

02:12.930 --> 02:13.860
As you wish.

02:17.200 --> 02:21.400
No!

02:21.470 --> 02:23.370
Find me that amulet!

02:25.110 --> 02:27.340
**

02:40.760 --> 02:42.020
(clanking)

03:41.380 --> 03:42.320
(boy)
Hello there.

03:42.390 --> 03:43.320
Manny Garcia.

03:43.390 --> 03:44.820
Nice to meet you.

03:44.890 --> 03:47.360
Manny Garcia, gosh, oh golly,
it is my pleasure

03:47.420 --> 03:49.360
to, uh...
make your acquaintance.

03:49.430 --> 03:51.090
(dog whimpering)

03:51.160 --> 03:52.730
Remember, Rufus, you only get
one chance to make

03:52.800 --> 03:54.300
a first impression.

03:54.300 --> 03:56.900
Blow that and all your
hopes and dreams wash away.

03:56.970 --> 03:57.830
(whimpering)

03:57.900 --> 03:59.300
So I gotta
nail this.

03:59.340 --> 04:00.400
Okay, Rufus?

04:00.470 --> 04:01.940
(barking)

04:02.000 --> 04:03.010
I'll try...

04:03.070 --> 04:05.970
Garcia...
Manny Garcia.

04:06.040 --> 04:07.580
(whimpering)

04:09.010 --> 04:10.550
Oh... sorry.

04:10.610 --> 04:11.780
How about...

04:11.850 --> 04:14.520
yo, yo, yo,
Manny G is in the house?

04:14.580 --> 04:16.180
(barking)

04:16.320 --> 04:18.089
(man)
Manny G is in
the bathroom.
(knocking)

04:20.860 --> 04:22.220
And he's been
in there all morning.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.030
At the moment,
this house only has

04:25.090 --> 04:26.400
one working bathroom,
Manny.

04:26.460 --> 04:27.530
I need to
get in there.

04:27.600 --> 04:29.800
Sorry, Dad,
it's just the first day

04:29.870 --> 04:32.230
at a new school,
in a new town.

04:32.340 --> 04:34.040
I gotta
perfect my Manny mojo.

04:34.100 --> 04:35.600
Your mojo
will be fine.

04:35.670 --> 04:36.810
Just be yourself.

04:38.070 --> 04:39.010
"Be yourself."

04:39.070 --> 04:40.080
That's all you got?

04:40.140 --> 04:41.110
Son, I gotta go.

04:42.710 --> 04:45.010
"Be yourself"
is not bad advice.

04:45.080 --> 04:47.180
You're a wonderful
young man.

04:47.250 --> 04:48.420
Look at this face.

04:48.480 --> 04:50.020
Who wouldn't want to
be friends with you?

04:50.090 --> 04:51.020
(barking)

04:51.090 --> 04:52.560
See, even
Rufus agrees.

04:53.660 --> 04:54.890
**

04:55.960 --> 04:57.760
Manny Garcia, Sagittarius.

04:59.360 --> 05:00.360
Hi, I'm Manny.

05:00.430 --> 05:01.560
Rhymes with "fanny."

05:01.630 --> 05:03.500
Ah, definite nope.

05:03.570 --> 05:04.970
Whoa,
lots of new faces.

05:06.230 --> 05:07.170
Whoa.

05:10.110 --> 05:11.070
Controversy.

05:11.140 --> 05:12.810
New school colors
take Taft.

05:12.880 --> 05:14.440
The old cobalt
and white are out.

05:14.510 --> 05:15.710
Red and blue
are in.

05:15.780 --> 05:17.480
Where do you stand,
student on the street?

05:17.550 --> 05:18.680
Um...

05:18.750 --> 05:20.150
Don't have
a strong opinion yet.

05:20.220 --> 05:22.390
I was in Texas until
like last week.

05:22.450 --> 05:23.420
(gasping)

05:23.490 --> 05:24.590
You're new.

05:24.650 --> 05:25.820
Apologies.

05:25.890 --> 05:26.990
Paige Prescott.

05:27.060 --> 05:28.590
Ace reporter for
"The Taft Tattler."

05:28.660 --> 05:31.160
Ah, Manny Garcia,
ace... new kid.

05:31.230 --> 05:33.400
Well, welcome to
Taft Middle School,

05:33.400 --> 05:34.960
Manny Garcia from Texas.

05:37.630 --> 05:39.400
Hey, one more
man-on-the-street question.

05:39.400 --> 05:41.240
Our spring dance is just
around the corner.

05:41.300 --> 05:43.710
Theme is still open and
suggestions are welcome.

05:43.770 --> 05:45.240
What gets you up
and moving?

05:45.310 --> 05:48.010
Uh, I guess
my dog, mostly.

05:48.080 --> 05:49.410
Dogs?

05:49.480 --> 05:50.580
Hmm, K-9 themed.

05:50.650 --> 05:51.750
Original.

05:51.810 --> 05:53.680
I shall suggest this
to the committee.

05:53.750 --> 05:55.680
(school bell ringing)
Interview over.

05:58.790 --> 06:00.160
Well, here we are.

06:00.220 --> 06:01.720
School sweet school.

06:01.790 --> 06:03.430
And the new
colors look good.

06:03.490 --> 06:04.590
You're gonna
do great.

06:04.660 --> 06:06.090
Thanks.

06:06.160 --> 06:09.330
And, um, anytime you wanna
interview me, I'm there.

06:09.430 --> 06:12.330
Manny Garcia, I think you're
gonna fit right in at Taft.

06:12.440 --> 06:13.440
Yeah, I think so.

06:14.700 --> 06:15.940
Oh!

06:17.640 --> 06:19.680
(all laughing)

06:19.740 --> 06:21.280
Oh...

06:23.010 --> 06:24.850
(cell phones clicking)

06:27.450 --> 06:28.980
Now, that's
front-page material.

06:30.820 --> 06:32.150
Oh...

06:33.520 --> 06:36.060
Sorry, Manny, we're not
moving back to Texas.

06:36.120 --> 06:38.260
Connecticut's where
our jobs are at now.

06:38.330 --> 06:39.730
How bad can it be?

06:39.800 --> 06:41.330
I was blue!

06:41.460 --> 06:43.070
Okay, the whole school
saw it happen.

06:43.130 --> 06:45.000
I know it wasn't
an ideal first day

06:45.070 --> 06:46.540
but it'll get better.

06:46.600 --> 06:48.540
It was embarrassing.

06:48.600 --> 06:50.310
Okay, I have
no friends here.

06:50.370 --> 06:52.210
(barking)

06:52.270 --> 06:53.880
I wouldn't say
"no friends."

06:55.480 --> 06:57.350
Yeah, you've got the best
one ever right there.

06:57.480 --> 06:59.350
And he's been
stuck inside all day.

06:59.480 --> 07:02.020
Come on, Rufus, I found
a cool park near by.

07:02.080 --> 07:03.550
Whoa, boy.

07:05.120 --> 07:06.050
Whoa, hey, boy.

07:06.120 --> 07:07.190
Okay, easy, easy.

07:07.260 --> 07:08.590
Can you get it?
Bet you can't.

07:08.660 --> 07:10.760
Come on, there are rules
to this game, all right?

07:10.830 --> 07:11.960
Easy.

07:12.030 --> 07:13.530
(laughing)
(barking)

07:16.220 --> 07:17.520
There she is coming up.

07:17.580 --> 07:19.420
Looking to the left,
looking to the right.

07:19.490 --> 07:21.050
Can Rufus steal?
Oh no, he can't.

07:21.090 --> 07:22.060
Garcia gets it.

07:23.290 --> 07:24.220
Squirrel!

07:24.290 --> 07:25.560
Got ya.

07:25.620 --> 07:27.460
And goal!

07:27.530 --> 07:28.590
(barking)

07:28.660 --> 07:30.330
Rufus,
where are you going?

07:30.400 --> 07:31.530
No, no, no.

07:37.070 --> 07:38.070
Rufus...

07:42.180 --> 07:43.110
Oh...

07:43.180 --> 07:45.210
Dude, you're
a soaking mess.

07:45.280 --> 07:46.450
Mom's gonna kill us.

07:46.510 --> 07:47.650
What's that?

07:50.580 --> 07:51.650
A necklace?

07:51.720 --> 07:53.250
What, you wanna wear it?

07:53.320 --> 07:56.360
There, now you're the coolest
dog in all of Connecticut.

07:56.420 --> 07:58.090
Happy?

07:58.090 --> 07:59.430
Ahh...

07:59.490 --> 08:01.560
Oh man,
wet-dog smell.

08:02.730 --> 08:04.300
Come on, Rufus,
we gotta go home.

08:06.370 --> 08:09.240
I can't believe I have to go
back to that school tomorrow.

08:09.300 --> 08:10.840
What a first impression.

08:10.900 --> 08:12.110
Let's get some sleep.

08:13.340 --> 08:14.770
(barking)

08:14.840 --> 08:16.780
Don't worry, you can keep
your new necklace on.

08:19.010 --> 08:20.310
Here.

08:20.380 --> 08:21.580
Go to bed, boy.

08:21.680 --> 08:22.840
Come on.

08:25.720 --> 08:27.250
**

08:29.820 --> 08:30.760
Good night, buddy.

08:30.820 --> 08:32.230
You're
a good friend.

08:32.289 --> 08:35.559
In fact, in this town,
you're my only friend.

08:35.630 --> 08:37.130
(barking)

08:38.530 --> 08:40.600
I just wished you were
the kind of friend who could

08:40.669 --> 08:43.000
talk back, be there
for me at school.

08:44.340 --> 08:47.670
Maybe make my life
not so generally... lame.

08:52.450 --> 08:55.010
**

09:05.620 --> 09:07.830
(Dad)
Manny, rise and shine!

09:07.890 --> 09:10.160
Okay, Dad,
I'm rising, I'm rising.

09:11.230 --> 09:12.970
Rufus, are you ready
to start our day?

09:16.970 --> 09:18.270
Rufus, are you awake?

09:25.880 --> 09:27.280
Ahh!
Ahh, whoa!

09:29.250 --> 09:31.180
Okay, who are you?

09:31.250 --> 09:32.820
It's me, Rufus.

09:32.890 --> 09:35.050
I've always wanted to
try out this people fur.

09:35.190 --> 09:36.920
It's clingy,
I like it.

09:39.630 --> 09:41.530
No, you can't be Rufus.

09:41.590 --> 09:42.960
What did you
do with my dog?

09:44.330 --> 09:45.600
I'm a boy now.

09:45.660 --> 09:47.530
Wow, isn't this
awesome?!

09:47.600 --> 09:49.200
Oh, wait,
I got an itch.

09:49.200 --> 09:50.200
Oh boy.

09:50.270 --> 09:52.810
(groaning)

10:01.450 --> 10:02.380
There we go, okay.

10:02.450 --> 10:04.020
Ooh... ooh!

10:04.080 --> 10:06.190
All right, yeah,
that's the sweet spot.

10:10.920 --> 10:12.260
Wait, a little bit,
a little bit.

10:12.330 --> 10:13.660
There we go, okay.

10:13.730 --> 10:16.200
You can't be Rufus,
you can't be.

10:16.260 --> 10:17.860
I would like
a treat now!

10:17.930 --> 10:20.470
Was it that thing,
the necklace?

10:20.530 --> 10:21.500
Is it magic?

10:21.570 --> 10:22.900
I would like
one treat, please.

10:22.970 --> 10:25.370
And, oh man, I did say
I wish you were a kid.

10:25.440 --> 10:26.970
Mm-hmm, duck,
chicken, jerky--

10:27.040 --> 10:29.070
I'm not that picky.
You gotta give me
that necklace.

10:29.140 --> 10:31.480
I have to turn you
into a dog again.
Whoa, no, no, no,
hey, hey!

10:31.540 --> 10:32.710
What if
I wanna be a boy?

10:32.780 --> 10:34.180
You can't be
a boy.

10:34.250 --> 10:35.280
You're a dog.

10:35.350 --> 10:36.980
(Dad)
Hey, Manny.
Hmm?

10:37.050 --> 10:38.220
Dad.

10:38.280 --> 10:39.720
**

10:41.450 --> 10:42.620
Hey, Dad.

10:42.690 --> 10:43.890
I'm up,
I'm very up.

10:43.960 --> 10:45.720
So up.
(whimpering)

10:45.790 --> 10:47.030
Stop goofing around
with Rufus

10:47.090 --> 10:49.090
and let's get
ready for school.

10:49.160 --> 10:50.400
Okay?
Okay.

10:50.460 --> 10:52.000
(barking)

10:52.060 --> 10:53.070
Bye.

10:58.440 --> 10:59.710
I'm a boy again!

11:01.070 --> 11:02.480
(sighing)

11:02.540 --> 11:04.340
Whoa.

11:04.410 --> 11:05.940
I got thumbs now.

11:06.010 --> 11:07.510
What am I gonna
do with you?
(panting)

11:07.580 --> 11:08.680
I can't leave you here...

11:08.750 --> 11:09.920
unless you give me
that necklace.

11:09.980 --> 11:11.320
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
hey, no, no, no!

11:11.380 --> 11:13.490
Hey, hey, hey, no,
not until I've eaten pizza

11:13.550 --> 11:14.520
and learn how to
play the piano

11:14.590 --> 11:15.890
and pee standing up.

11:15.950 --> 11:17.790
What am I gonna do?
I can't take you to school.

11:18.920 --> 11:19.980
Why not?

11:20.040 --> 11:21.140
I mean, you wished
for a friend

11:21.180 --> 11:22.280
you could take
to school, right?

11:22.350 --> 11:23.350
Well, here I am,

11:23.410 --> 11:24.480
your best friend,
right?

11:24.550 --> 11:25.750
So take me
to school already.

11:25.810 --> 11:28.520
I guess I could pass you
off as a normal kid.

11:29.990 --> 11:30.820
Would it work?

11:30.890 --> 11:31.950
Oh, yeah,
I'm very normal.

11:32.020 --> 11:32.960
Wait!

11:33.020 --> 11:33.890
Where-- where--
where's my tail?

11:33.960 --> 11:35.160
Wait, wait,
where's my tail?

11:35.190 --> 11:36.490
How-- how will I know
when I'm happy?

11:36.560 --> 11:37.990
(gasping)

11:38.060 --> 11:39.730
I can give you
the thumbs-up.

11:42.060 --> 11:43.300
Problem solved.

11:43.370 --> 11:44.600
(laughing)

11:45.700 --> 11:47.300
These people furs
are tight.

11:47.370 --> 11:48.570
Why do you
guys wear these?

11:48.640 --> 11:49.610
If we don't wear pants,

11:49.670 --> 11:50.970
we end up in
the people kennel.

11:52.200 --> 11:53.040
What?

11:53.360 --> 11:54.300
Here.

11:54.740 --> 11:56.180
These might fit you better.

11:56.250 --> 11:57.280
Catch.

11:57.350 --> 11:59.420
(growling)

11:59.480 --> 12:01.920
**

12:05.850 --> 12:06.920
Later, Mom and Dad.

12:06.990 --> 12:08.360
Don't wanna be
late on my second day.

12:08.420 --> 12:09.660
Love school.

12:09.730 --> 12:10.990
Bye.
Yeah, later,
Mom and Dad.

12:11.060 --> 12:12.400
Shh!

12:12.460 --> 12:14.800
Okay, we made it out okay.

12:14.860 --> 12:16.030
But if you're
gonna be a normal boy,

12:16.100 --> 12:17.630
you gotta start
acting like one.

12:17.700 --> 12:18.900
Wow!

12:18.970 --> 12:20.100
I can be normal,
Manny.

12:20.200 --> 12:21.100
(barking)

12:21.200 --> 12:23.040
Oh, hey, Larry!

12:23.110 --> 12:24.240
What's up?

12:24.310 --> 12:25.770
How's it going, man?

12:25.840 --> 12:27.580
Yeah, oh...

12:27.640 --> 12:29.280
All right, all right,
sniff you later.

12:29.350 --> 12:30.710
(laughing)

12:30.780 --> 12:34.920
FYI, the generic kidney
and trout you're feeding Larry

12:34.980 --> 12:36.390
is giving him gas.

12:36.450 --> 12:38.220
Um, good to know.

12:38.220 --> 12:39.220
Spend a buck.

12:39.220 --> 12:40.960
I'm sorry.

12:41.020 --> 12:42.530
That's what
I'm talking about.

12:42.590 --> 12:44.030
(farting)
Sorry, Larry.

12:44.090 --> 12:45.290
(farting)

12:45.360 --> 12:47.260
I've been watching
you for years, Manny.

12:47.330 --> 12:48.830
Dog years-- do you know
how long that is?

12:48.900 --> 12:50.500
I can be normal...
(squirrel chattering)

12:50.570 --> 12:52.700
A squirrel,
a squirrel!

12:52.770 --> 12:53.870
Squirrel!

12:53.940 --> 12:55.500
I want the squirrel,
I'm gonna get you!

12:55.570 --> 12:57.770
Just get away,
just get away!

12:57.840 --> 13:01.010
Dude, you're human now,
get a grip.

13:01.080 --> 13:02.280
You don't
get it, Manny.

13:02.350 --> 13:03.450
It's a squirrel.

13:03.510 --> 13:04.980
Buddy, I get it, okay,
but why do dogs hate

13:05.050 --> 13:07.250
squirrels
so much anyway?
Oh...

13:07.280 --> 13:09.490
If only you knew the evil
behind their bushy tails.

13:10.750 --> 13:12.660
The stories
I could tell you.

13:12.720 --> 13:14.420
The things dogs
have seen.

13:16.460 --> 13:18.260
This is gonna work
but you gotta blend in.

13:18.260 --> 13:20.800
Okay, no chasing squirrels,
just don't be weird.

13:20.860 --> 13:22.780
Okay?

13:22.960 --> 13:23.840
Rufus?

13:24.400 --> 13:26.440
Oh... you're not doing

13:26.500 --> 13:28.340
what I think you're
doing, are you?

13:29.070 --> 13:30.310
What, aren't we
going for a walk?

13:30.370 --> 13:32.610
This is what I always do
when we go for a walk.

13:32.680 --> 13:34.040
Seriously?

13:34.110 --> 13:35.380
Did you not
bring a bag?

13:37.980 --> 13:39.110
This is awkward.

13:41.980 --> 13:43.190
(school bell ringing)

13:44.450 --> 13:45.520
Hmm...

13:46.990 --> 13:48.590
Your cousin.

13:48.660 --> 13:51.460
Yes, he's, uh,
visiting...

13:51.530 --> 13:53.600
from somewhere for, uh,

13:53.660 --> 13:54.730
I don't
know how long.

13:54.800 --> 13:56.970
(sniffing)

13:57.030 --> 13:58.130
You have cats, don't you?

13:58.200 --> 13:59.500
I smell cats,
do you smell cats?

13:59.570 --> 14:01.140
(all laughing)

14:02.260 --> 14:03.420
Hmm...

14:03.910 --> 14:05.570
Seems weird.

14:05.640 --> 14:07.640
But they don't
pay me enough to care.

14:08.980 --> 14:10.510
Okay, Rufus, sit.

14:13.880 --> 14:15.950
(all laughing)

14:18.190 --> 14:19.890
I meant in a chair.

14:21.660 --> 14:23.030
Oh!

14:23.090 --> 14:24.930
I'm not allowed to sit
on the furniture at home.

14:24.990 --> 14:27.100
(all laughing)

14:29.770 --> 14:31.530
Uh... okay.

14:33.040 --> 14:34.600
(mumbling)

14:36.810 --> 14:37.740
(sniffing)

14:37.810 --> 14:39.340
(all laughing)

14:42.350 --> 14:43.750
So...
What?

14:43.810 --> 14:46.080
... we were talking about
themes of transformation

14:46.150 --> 14:48.080
in Kafka's "Metamorphosis."

14:48.150 --> 14:50.690
You are hilarious,
dog.

14:50.750 --> 14:52.690
Oh...

14:52.760 --> 14:54.890
Thanks
but I'm not a dog.

14:54.960 --> 14:56.830
I'm a human boy.

14:56.890 --> 14:58.590
(all laughing)

15:07.500 --> 15:08.800
With squirrels,
the key is to get it

15:08.870 --> 15:10.140
before it gets in the tree

15:10.210 --> 15:12.480
'cause once they're
in the tree, it's over.

15:12.540 --> 15:13.540
What's up?

15:13.610 --> 15:15.280
Well, see you later,
Rufus.

15:15.380 --> 15:16.680
What's your name again?

15:16.750 --> 15:17.680
Manny.

15:17.750 --> 15:18.950
Oh, right, Marty.

15:19.010 --> 15:21.750
Dude, your cousin
is awesome.

15:21.820 --> 15:23.450
Catch you guys later.

15:23.520 --> 15:24.450
Okay, later.

15:25.820 --> 15:27.760
And it's Manny.

15:27.820 --> 15:29.020
Did I do good?

15:29.090 --> 15:30.530
Yeah, really good,
Rufus.

15:30.590 --> 15:32.530
Oh, so we can
play ball now?

15:32.600 --> 15:33.400
No.

15:33.400 --> 15:34.800
We've got more classes.

15:34.860 --> 15:36.400
More?

15:36.400 --> 15:37.230
Man...

15:37.300 --> 15:38.600
(ball bouncing)
(gasping)

15:38.670 --> 15:39.940
He's got a ball!

15:40.000 --> 15:41.240
Ball, ball,
ball, ball...
Here, boy!

15:41.300 --> 15:43.070
* Don't stop *

15:43.140 --> 15:45.040
* Doing what you're doing *

15:46.410 --> 15:48.140
* Every time
you move to the beat *

15:48.210 --> 15:49.680
* It gets harder for me *

15:49.750 --> 15:51.910
* And you know it,

15:51.980 --> 15:54.150
* Don't stop *

15:54.220 --> 15:56.250
* Doing what you're doing *

15:57.550 --> 15:59.290
* Every time
you move to the beat *

15:59.420 --> 16:00.920
* It gets harder for me *

16:00.990 --> 16:03.630
* And you know it,
know it, know it *

16:04.890 --> 16:07.030

* Doing what you're doing *

16:10.430 --> 16:12.200

you move to the beat *

16:12.270 --> 16:13.700
* It gets harder for me *

16:13.770 --> 16:17.270
* And you know it,
know it, know it *

16:17.340 --> 16:19.640
* And don't stop *

16:19.710 --> 16:22.810
* 'Cause you know
that I like it *

16:22.880 --> 16:24.910
* Every time
you walk in the room *

16:24.980 --> 16:26.480
* You got all eyes on you *

16:26.550 --> 16:30.250
* And you know it, know it,
know it, know it *

16:30.320 --> 16:32.490
* And don't stop *

16:32.560 --> 16:35.690
* 'Cause you know
that I like it *

16:35.760 --> 16:37.660
* Every time
you walk in the room *

16:37.730 --> 16:39.460
* You got all eyes
on you *

16:39.460 --> 16:40.730
* And you know it *

16:41.800 --> 16:43.570
* Every day
it's the same *

16:43.630 --> 16:45.870
* All the games that you play *

16:48.300 --> 16:49.970
* Back and forth
round and round *

16:50.040 --> 16:52.940
* Kinda like it this way *

16:54.240 --> 16:56.510
* Don't stop *

16:56.580 --> 16:59.520
* Doing what you're doing *

16:59.580 --> 17:01.720

* And you know it,
know it, know it *

17:07.290 --> 17:09.490
* Don't stop *

17:09.530 --> 17:12.530
* 'Cause you know that
I like it *

17:12.599 --> 17:14.530
* Every time
you walk in the room *

17:14.599 --> 17:16.060
* You got all eyes on you *

17:16.130 --> 17:19.300
* And you know it,
know it, know it *

17:19.369 --> 17:20.839
Squirrel!

17:20.900 --> 17:22.510
Squirrel!

17:22.569 --> 17:24.010
Hey, don't
go behind that tree!

17:24.069 --> 17:26.210
I got you, I got you!
It's just a squirrel.

17:26.270 --> 17:28.980
* Every time you move to the
beat it gets harder for me *

17:29.040 --> 17:30.550
* And you know it,
know it, know it **

17:30.610 --> 17:31.780
(whistle blowing)

17:32.960 --> 17:36.320
(man)
So you're telling me there's
no sign of that amulet?

17:36.390 --> 17:37.990
I'm sorry, Mr. Black,

17:38.050 --> 17:39.460
but we've
searched everywhere.

17:39.520 --> 17:41.220
I have devoted
countless years

17:41.260 --> 17:42.930
to finding that amulet,

17:42.990 --> 17:44.090
unthinkable
sums of money--

17:44.230 --> 17:46.030
I will not give up!

17:46.090 --> 17:47.230
Okay.

17:47.230 --> 17:48.360
But it's gonna
take a miracle.

17:48.430 --> 17:49.670
(squirrel chattering)
Whoa!

17:49.730 --> 17:51.070
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
(tires screeching)

17:52.130 --> 17:53.270
Whoa!

17:55.140 --> 17:56.240
Sorry, sorry!

17:56.240 --> 17:57.640
My friend here has
a real problem

17:57.710 --> 17:59.240
with squirrels.
Hey.
(squirrel chattering)

18:00.940 --> 18:02.610
**

18:03.910 --> 18:05.610
Hey, what's that?
Rufus, wait!

18:05.680 --> 18:07.820
A miracle indeed.

18:07.880 --> 18:13.790
(laughing maniacally)

18:16.730 --> 18:17.890
**

18:17.960 --> 18:20.260
Dude, dude, you gotta
rein that in, okay?

18:20.330 --> 18:22.670
Squirrels are not
worth getting run over for.

18:22.730 --> 18:24.030
Squirrels are evil, Manny.

18:24.100 --> 18:25.530
They have big plans,
terrible plans,

18:25.600 --> 18:27.070
plans humans couldn't
even comprehend.

18:27.140 --> 18:29.710
Sure, okay, right,
evil squirrels, whatever.

18:29.770 --> 18:31.170
Tell you what, I'm hungry.

18:31.270 --> 18:32.640
How about a snack,
okay, your choice?

18:35.140 --> 18:36.280
(dog barking)

18:37.260 --> 18:38.260
Really?

18:38.380 --> 18:40.620
I love Power Puppy Kibble
so much.

18:40.680 --> 18:42.720
Okay, whatever,
if you want Power Puppy,

18:42.790 --> 18:44.020
I'll buy you
Power Puppy.

18:44.090 --> 18:45.290
Oh, sweet!

18:46.360 --> 18:47.990
(bells jingling)
Paige!

18:48.060 --> 18:49.990
Oh, kittens!

18:50.060 --> 18:51.090
I love kittens!

18:51.160 --> 18:52.560
All dogs secretly do.

18:52.630 --> 18:53.660
The problem
are cats.

18:53.730 --> 18:54.930
I hate cats.

18:55.000 --> 18:55.960
Quiet.

18:56.030 --> 18:57.630
Maybe she'll see us.

18:57.700 --> 18:59.300
Who?
Paige.

18:59.340 --> 19:00.970
She's a girl
from my school.

19:01.040 --> 19:02.410
I met her on my
first day.

19:02.470 --> 19:04.610
Oh, so she's a friend.
Not exactly.

19:04.670 --> 19:06.610
I mean, I'd like her
to be but I'm afraid--

19:06.680 --> 19:07.610
Hey, Paige!

19:07.680 --> 19:08.880
What are you doing?

19:08.940 --> 19:09.950
Well, you said you wanted
her to be your friend.

19:10.010 --> 19:11.150
Paige, over here!

19:12.210 --> 19:13.220
Hi, Paige.

19:13.320 --> 19:14.920
No, no, no,
bad, Rufus.

19:14.980 --> 19:17.050
I'm Rufus.
Uh, hi.

19:17.120 --> 19:18.320
You go to
my school, right?

19:18.350 --> 19:20.460
You're Manny's cousin.
Oh, right.

19:20.520 --> 19:22.330
I wanted to let you know
that Manny's afraid to--

19:22.390 --> 19:25.390
Afraid
I'm covered in kittens.

19:25.460 --> 19:26.500
Oh!

19:26.560 --> 19:27.700
So cute.

19:27.760 --> 19:29.130
Yeah, you think that...

19:29.200 --> 19:30.730
before they
dig their claws in.

19:30.800 --> 19:31.930
Oh...

19:32.000 --> 19:34.100
So, uh, what's the news
at school?

19:34.170 --> 19:36.810
Any big
scoops coming up?

19:36.870 --> 19:38.340
(chuckling)

19:38.340 --> 19:40.040
Page one is you two.

19:40.110 --> 19:41.610
From out of nowhere,
you guys are

19:41.680 --> 19:43.550
the two most
popular dudes in school.

19:45.450 --> 19:47.520
Okay, popular twins,
catch you later.

19:47.580 --> 19:49.350
My goldfish gets
grumpy when it's hungry.

19:50.220 --> 19:51.440
Later.

19:53.220 --> 19:54.460
(bells jingling)

19:57.400 --> 19:58.390
(coughing)

19:59.660 --> 20:01.260
You are the best
wingman ever.

20:01.330 --> 20:02.900
I have no idea what
you're talking about.

20:02.970 --> 20:04.300
I don't have wings.

20:04.370 --> 20:05.730
It just means if you
look good, I look good.

20:05.800 --> 20:07.100
It's win-win.
Oh, it means good.

20:07.170 --> 20:08.740
The point
is you rock.

20:08.800 --> 20:10.270
The target is
coming your way.

20:12.680 --> 20:13.580
We're ready.

20:13.640 --> 20:15.340
Thanks to you, I've got
the town eating out of

20:15.410 --> 20:16.510
the palm of my hand.

20:16.580 --> 20:18.350
I love eating out of
the palm of your hand.

20:19.800 --> 20:21.750
Know what
we're doing today?
Chase squirrels.

20:21.820 --> 20:23.990
Yes, we're gonna
chase some squirrels.

20:24.050 --> 20:25.690
What a--
what a great idea.

20:25.750 --> 20:26.960
I got this.

20:29.660 --> 20:31.260
(groaning)

20:31.330 --> 20:32.900
(Rufus)
Why am I the only one
who wants to do that?

20:32.960 --> 20:34.730
I feel like-- I feel
like you don't get me.

20:34.800 --> 20:35.900
I smell garbage.

20:36.100 --> 20:37.920
(sighing)
Idiot.

20:38.800 --> 20:41.370
Manny, did you
know about this?

20:41.440 --> 20:42.640
The dance.

20:42.710 --> 20:43.870
Oh yeah.

20:43.940 --> 20:44.910
They used my suggestion.

20:44.970 --> 20:46.340
They're going to
the dogs.

20:46.410 --> 20:48.240
I guess Paige
really sold it.

20:48.310 --> 20:49.040
Awesome!

20:49.110 --> 20:50.410
She's the best.

20:50.480 --> 20:52.320
You should ask
Paige to the dance.

20:52.380 --> 20:53.550
I don't know.

20:53.620 --> 20:54.880
Maybe.
Maybe?

20:54.950 --> 20:55.880
(Mom)
Manny?

20:55.950 --> 20:57.090
Manny?

20:58.350 --> 20:59.520
Where's Rufus?

20:59.590 --> 21:01.360
Uh, I haven't seen him.

21:01.420 --> 21:02.360
Why?

21:02.430 --> 21:03.960
He chewed my
patent leather shoe.

21:04.030 --> 21:05.630
I can't even find
the other one.

21:05.690 --> 21:07.160
Ugh, that dog!

21:09.470 --> 21:10.960
Dude?

21:11.060 --> 21:13.670
You ate my mom's shoe so she
still thinks we have a dog?

21:13.740 --> 21:14.970
Genius.

21:15.040 --> 21:17.610
Right, 'cause that's
totally why I did that.

21:18.870 --> 21:20.780
You wanna know
what else I did?

21:20.840 --> 21:22.450
I pooped behind
the couch.

21:22.510 --> 21:24.450
(laughing)

21:26.620 --> 21:29.050
Why wouldn't you ask
Paige to the dance?

21:29.150 --> 21:30.220
She's really pretty.

21:30.290 --> 21:31.750
Yes, she is--
whatever.

21:31.820 --> 21:33.590
(cell phone ringing)

21:33.660 --> 21:34.990
(sniffing)

21:39.060 --> 21:40.000
Hello.

21:40.060 --> 21:41.000
Manny Garcia.

21:41.060 --> 21:42.270
Hey, Paige.

21:42.330 --> 21:43.730
I was just
talking about you

21:43.800 --> 21:45.400
with my...

21:45.470 --> 21:48.040
um, dog... yo.
(laughing)

21:48.170 --> 21:49.440
Yeah, dog,
that's funny.

21:49.510 --> 21:50.740
What's up?

21:50.810 --> 21:53.380
Well, being the school's
top newspaper reporter...

21:54.580 --> 21:57.180
... okay, only newspaper
reporter,

21:57.210 --> 21:59.480
I was wondering if I could
score an exclusive interview

21:59.550 --> 22:02.390
with Taft's most interesting
new student?

22:02.450 --> 22:04.550
I'm pretty sure
I can arrange that.

22:04.620 --> 22:05.690
Awesome!

22:05.750 --> 22:07.190
Have Rufus meet me after
school tomorrow

22:07.260 --> 22:08.820
on the quad.

22:08.890 --> 22:10.390
Wait, what?

22:10.460 --> 22:11.830
Rufus.

22:11.890 --> 22:13.600
I wanna
interview Rufus.

22:13.660 --> 22:15.660
Oh, right, Rufus.

22:15.730 --> 22:18.000
Popular guy,
class clown.

22:18.070 --> 22:19.970
The big dog.

22:20.040 --> 22:21.040
Right!

22:21.100 --> 22:22.210
So you'll set it up?

22:22.240 --> 22:24.610
Yeah, I will.
Awesome.

22:24.670 --> 22:25.610
Later.

22:30.210 --> 22:31.350
I mean...

22:31.410 --> 22:32.650
who would want to
interview me?

22:42.330 --> 22:44.260
I'd interview you.

22:44.330 --> 22:45.590
You're almost
out of popcorn.

22:47.760 --> 22:48.900
**

22:48.960 --> 22:49.900
Me?

22:49.970 --> 22:50.970
Paige wants to
interview me?

22:51.030 --> 22:53.240
Yes, you.
Wow.

22:53.270 --> 22:54.500
Me?
Yes, you.

22:55.800 --> 22:57.470
Are you mad about
something?
No.

22:58.810 --> 23:00.510
Uh, you sure?

23:00.580 --> 23:01.880
I'm not.

23:01.940 --> 23:03.250
You sound kinda mad.

23:03.310 --> 23:05.350
Like that time I chewed up
your baseball glove.

23:05.410 --> 23:06.920
Okay, it's a little
annoying that you...

23:06.980 --> 23:08.680
I got this.

23:08.750 --> 23:11.320
(Manny)
I like to do things a lot.
(Rufus)
Like play catch.

23:11.390 --> 23:13.690
Time to wrap things up.

23:15.390 --> 23:16.990
(horn honking)

23:18.960 --> 23:19.900
Idiot.

23:21.040 --> 23:23.030
(Paige)
Thanks for agreeing to
do this interview, Rufus.

23:23.100 --> 23:24.330
Oh, of course.

23:24.400 --> 23:25.900
I think newspapers
are very important.

23:25.970 --> 23:27.300
You do?

23:27.370 --> 23:29.670
People need newspapers
to do their business.

23:29.740 --> 23:31.040
I've been
doing my business on them

23:31.110 --> 23:32.580
ever since I was
a pup.

23:32.640 --> 23:33.510
Finally!

23:33.580 --> 23:35.540
Someone gets it.
Yeah.

23:35.610 --> 23:37.880
So, Rufus, over night...
(sniffing)

23:37.950 --> 23:40.280
... you've become the most
popular kid in school.

23:40.280 --> 23:41.550
How does that feel?

23:42.920 --> 23:44.090
Weird.

23:44.150 --> 23:45.650
Because you're
the new kid?

23:45.720 --> 23:47.290
Because I'm new
at being a kid.

23:47.360 --> 23:49.160
(ball bouncing)
Ball!

23:49.290 --> 23:50.790
(laughing)

23:50.860 --> 23:52.300
You are funny.

23:52.300 --> 23:54.100
Is that your secret
to making friends?

23:54.160 --> 23:55.660
Uh... sort of.

23:55.730 --> 23:57.100
I mean, when
I see someone new,

23:57.170 --> 23:59.800
I kinda just bounce around
them 'til they smile

23:59.870 --> 24:01.400
and then-- boom--
instant friends.

24:01.470 --> 24:02.610
Works with everybody.

24:02.670 --> 24:04.210
Well, except cats.

24:04.310 --> 24:06.740
Dogged determination.

24:06.810 --> 24:07.740
I like that.

24:09.010 --> 24:10.150
(recorder beeping)

24:10.210 --> 24:12.650
Now, Rufus, the whole
school wants to know,

24:12.720 --> 24:15.020
will you be taking a special
someone to the dance?

24:15.080 --> 24:17.590
Well, Paige, turns out I've
been meaning to talk to you

24:17.650 --> 24:19.420
about that
very subject.

24:27.160 --> 24:29.530
(cheers and applause)

24:32.170 --> 24:34.540
**

24:34.600 --> 24:36.540
(cheers and applause)

24:38.970 --> 24:41.580
(Rufus)
So, guys, best in show,
you know who to vote for.

24:42.680 --> 24:44.680
The big dog,
am I right?

24:44.750 --> 24:45.780
Yeah.

24:47.050 --> 24:48.050
**

24:48.120 --> 24:52.960
* Let's make some noise *

24:53.020 --> 24:54.720
* You throw
your hands up *

24:54.790 --> 24:56.160
* You throw your
hands up *

24:56.220 --> 25:00.700
* Make some noise *

25:00.760 --> 25:03.370
* Your body's stomping to
the beat of *

25:03.430 --> 25:05.070
* Beat of... *

25:05.130 --> 25:06.370
Oh, hey.

25:06.400 --> 25:08.140
(girl)
Yeah, let's go dance.

25:08.200 --> 25:10.640
* Raise your voice
girls and boys *

25:10.710 --> 25:13.580
* And make
some noise **

25:13.640 --> 25:15.210
A real human dance.

25:15.280 --> 25:16.380
So cool.

25:16.450 --> 25:17.910
Yeah, cool.

25:17.980 --> 25:19.820
I mean, there's
music and friends

25:19.880 --> 25:21.180
and they're gonna announce
best in show

25:21.250 --> 25:22.850
and-- ooh, ooh--

25:22.920 --> 25:24.950
I'm pretty sure I know
who it's gonna be.

25:25.020 --> 25:27.420
Congratulations
in advance, Rufus.

25:27.490 --> 25:29.090
And the best part
is my big surprise.

25:30.120 --> 25:31.240
Paige.

25:32.960 --> 25:34.200
Who told you?

25:34.260 --> 25:36.300
I'm gonna...
go get some punch.

25:38.270 --> 25:39.670
(barking rhythmically)

25:39.740 --> 25:41.270
**

25:42.380 --> 25:43.460
Huh?

25:43.970 --> 25:46.110
Yo, dog,
this is your song.

25:46.110 --> 25:47.110
(barking rhythmically)

25:47.180 --> 25:48.140
This is my song.

25:48.210 --> 25:49.350
Come dance.

25:49.410 --> 25:50.350
* Hey *

25:50.410 --> 25:51.380
(barking rhythmically)

25:51.450 --> 25:52.380
* Roor *

25:52.450 --> 25:53.650
(barking rhythmically)

25:53.720 --> 25:54.980
Whoo!

25:55.120 --> 25:55.980
* Hey *

25:56.120 --> 25:56.990
(barking rhythmically)

25:57.120 --> 25:58.350
* Hey *

25:58.420 --> 26:00.360
* You think
you're top dog *

26:06.430 --> 26:07.960
* You think you're
top dog *

26:09.270 --> 26:10.630
Yo!

26:10.700 --> 26:12.470
* You think
you're top dog *

26:15.470 --> 26:16.640
* Go *

26:18.340 --> 26:20.040
* You think you're top dog *

26:20.140 --> 26:23.010
* Go, go, go,
go, go, go *

26:23.150 --> 26:26.220
* Go, go,
go, go, go, go *

26:26.280 --> 26:28.820
* You think you're top dog *

26:28.880 --> 26:30.050
* All right *
All right!

26:30.150 --> 26:32.590
* Go, go, go, go *

26:32.660 --> 26:34.460
* All right *

26:34.520 --> 26:36.430
* You think you're top dog *

26:36.490 --> 26:38.430
* In the house
on the street *

26:38.490 --> 26:40.530
* On the block
off the leash *

26:41.960 --> 26:43.900
* You think you're top dog *

26:43.970 --> 26:47.970

27:06.460 --> 27:08.490
(howling)

27:09.590 --> 27:11.530
**

27:25.210 --> 27:26.220
Manny,
did you see?

27:26.280 --> 27:27.210
I made a dance.

27:27.210 --> 27:28.510
It's amazing what
you can do

27:28.580 --> 27:30.910
when your knees
bend the other way.

27:30.980 --> 27:33.120
Being a human boy is even
better than I ever dreamed.

27:33.220 --> 27:34.950
Yeah, awesome.

27:35.020 --> 27:36.520
I'm sure your date loves
the dance too.

27:36.590 --> 27:38.290
Probably gonna write a
front-page article about it.

27:38.350 --> 27:41.790
"Dog Dude Designs
Dumb Dance."

27:41.860 --> 27:43.060
Manny?

27:43.130 --> 27:45.930
This move has been really
hard for me, Rufus.

27:45.990 --> 27:48.540
Somehow you've made my
terrible life even worse.

27:49.160 --> 27:51.100
And ever since you've put
that necklace on,

27:51.230 --> 27:53.070
you've been...

27:53.140 --> 27:55.240
A bad dog?

27:55.240 --> 27:56.240
A bad friend.

28:01.440 --> 28:03.250
(whimpering)

28:08.350 --> 28:09.790
Hey there, Manny.

28:09.850 --> 28:11.520
Your date just left.

28:11.590 --> 28:14.660
Um, you're standing
right in front of me.

28:14.720 --> 28:15.720
What are you
talking about?

28:15.790 --> 28:17.160
Rufus is your date.

28:17.260 --> 28:18.530
Oh, news flash.

28:18.590 --> 28:20.000
You are my date.

28:20.060 --> 28:20.900
What?

28:20.960 --> 28:22.730
Rufus asked me
out for you.

28:22.800 --> 28:24.130
Turns out I've been
meaning to talk to you

28:24.270 --> 28:25.870
about that very subject.

28:25.930 --> 28:28.640
Will you go to
the dance with...

28:28.700 --> 28:29.970
my best friend Manny?

28:31.570 --> 28:32.780
I would love to.

28:33.840 --> 28:35.480
Rufus did that for me?
Yeah.

28:35.540 --> 28:37.410
He said you were too
shy to do it yourself.

28:37.480 --> 28:38.780
Oh man.

28:38.850 --> 28:40.620
I think I just stepped
in a big pile of...

28:40.680 --> 28:43.650
(man)
Manny Garcia and Paige Prescott,

28:43.720 --> 28:44.890
come on up!

28:44.950 --> 28:46.820
You're best in show
of the dance!

28:46.890 --> 28:49.330
(cheers and applause)

28:49.390 --> 28:50.560
Whoo, that's right!

28:50.630 --> 28:52.560
Give it up for your
royal couple!

28:52.630 --> 28:54.200
Yeah!

28:54.300 --> 28:55.500
Whoo!

28:55.560 --> 28:57.600
Now, don't you two
look surprised.

28:57.670 --> 29:00.870
I thought it
was gonna be Rufus.

29:00.940 --> 29:02.510
It was Rufus' idea.

29:02.570 --> 29:03.540
(all)
Yeah.

29:03.610 --> 29:04.540
You know
who to vote for.

29:04.610 --> 29:06.210
The big dog,
am I right?

29:06.310 --> 29:07.680
The big dog!

29:07.740 --> 29:09.650
And you guys know
who the big dog is?

29:09.710 --> 29:11.050
That's right,
my boy Manny.

29:14.480 --> 29:15.680
All right.

29:15.750 --> 29:17.320
But what about me?

29:17.350 --> 29:19.090
That was his idea too.

29:19.150 --> 29:21.890
And vote for Paige too 'cause
Manny really likes her.

29:23.160 --> 29:25.390
So how does
it feel to be king?!

29:27.160 --> 29:29.330
Right now, I don't feel
like a king.

29:32.000 --> 29:33.740
I feel like
a low-down dirty dog.

29:41.160 --> 29:42.910
Thank you, everyone...

29:44.250 --> 29:46.420
... for this very kind
and thoughtful honor.

29:48.550 --> 29:52.020
But... after the way
I treated my friend,

29:52.090 --> 29:53.820
my best friend,

29:53.980 --> 29:55.480
there's...

29:56.220 --> 29:58.460
no way I can
accept this.

29:58.530 --> 29:59.900
What?

29:59.960 --> 30:01.760
What?
What?

30:01.830 --> 30:03.620
I also cannot accept.

30:04.400 --> 30:06.170
If you read
my three-part series,

30:06.230 --> 30:08.700
"The Shameful Sham Of Class
102's Homeroom President,"

30:08.770 --> 30:11.240
then you know I find
these popularity contests

30:11.310 --> 30:12.980
objectifying and demeaning.

30:16.650 --> 30:17.580
On the other hand...

30:20.220 --> 30:21.820
... tiaras
are kind of cute.

30:21.880 --> 30:23.450
(scattered applause)

30:26.420 --> 30:27.490
Rufus?

30:27.560 --> 30:29.060
Hey, Rufus.

30:29.130 --> 30:30.330
Manny.

30:30.390 --> 30:31.690
What's going on?

30:31.760 --> 30:33.760
Paige, I can't
explain it to you.

30:33.830 --> 30:35.930
You'd never believe...
me.
Rufus is a dog.

30:37.000 --> 30:38.870
How could you
possibly know that?

30:38.930 --> 30:40.670
A reporter's instinct.

30:43.060 --> 30:44.120
And he told me.

30:44.940 --> 30:48.600
Oh, and also...
I'm a dog.

30:52.720 --> 30:54.550
That would be D-O...
A dog?

30:54.620 --> 30:56.350
(Paige)
Told me about
the magic necklace,

30:56.420 --> 30:58.120
your wish and everything.

30:58.190 --> 30:59.560
Of course he did.

30:59.620 --> 31:02.860
Look, I owe Rufus
a huge apology.

31:02.930 --> 31:04.930
Can you
help me find him?

31:04.990 --> 31:06.160
You go that way,
I'll go this way.

31:06.230 --> 31:07.830
We meet on the other
side of the library.

31:07.900 --> 31:09.130
Thanks, Paige.

31:11.200 --> 31:12.700
Rufus,
where are you, boy?

31:12.770 --> 31:15.000
(howling in the distance)

31:16.570 --> 31:18.140
Rufus?

31:18.170 --> 31:20.510
(Dad)
Hey, Linda,
did you walk the dog?

31:20.580 --> 31:22.650
Nope, did you?

31:22.710 --> 31:23.710
No.

31:23.780 --> 31:24.910
I haven't seen him either.

31:27.150 --> 31:29.020
Maybe he's eating
your wedding dress.

31:29.150 --> 31:30.920
It'll match your shoes.

31:30.990 --> 31:32.420
That's not funny.

31:32.490 --> 31:33.720
Rufus?

31:33.790 --> 31:35.160
Rufus?
Rufus?

31:36.760 --> 31:38.690
Rufus... Rufus?

31:38.760 --> 31:40.160
(whistling)

31:40.200 --> 31:41.600
Rufus?

31:41.660 --> 31:43.270
Rufus... Rufus?

31:44.530 --> 31:46.200
Rufus?

31:46.270 --> 31:47.270
Rufus?

31:49.470 --> 31:50.710
He's not here.

31:50.770 --> 31:51.770
We lost the dog.

31:51.840 --> 31:52.980
(sighing)

31:53.040 --> 31:54.340
This move has been hard
enough on Manny.

31:54.410 --> 31:56.210
If we lost his dog,
he'll hate life forever.

31:56.280 --> 31:57.850
Remember when we
had Rufus tagged

31:57.910 --> 31:59.180
with the GPS chip

31:59.250 --> 32:00.950
and you thought it
was a waste of money?

32:01.020 --> 32:02.250
(beeping)

32:04.020 --> 32:05.550
I may have been
wrong on that one.

32:05.620 --> 32:07.090
He is at the school?

32:08.420 --> 32:09.690
Let's go!
Give me the keys!

32:09.760 --> 32:11.030
You drive
too slow!

32:12.090 --> 32:13.230
(tires screeching)

32:13.300 --> 32:14.360
(cat shrieking)

32:14.430 --> 32:15.430
(tires screeching)

32:16.700 --> 32:17.900
Rufus?

32:17.970 --> 32:19.970
Rufus, buddy...
you there?

32:20.040 --> 32:21.500
(howling in the distance)

32:21.570 --> 32:23.040
Is that you?

32:23.110 --> 32:26.240
Look, I'm sorry
I was being such a jerk.

32:26.310 --> 32:28.440
(howling in the distance)

32:28.510 --> 32:29.980
Rufus?

32:30.050 --> 32:31.580
(howling)

32:33.350 --> 32:35.220
You're not here
for the dance, are you?

32:36.290 --> 32:37.920
Let's go!
Hey, let me go!

32:37.990 --> 32:40.690
You're coming
with us, kid.
Where are you taking me?
Help!

32:40.760 --> 32:42.760
(Rufus howling)

32:42.830 --> 32:43.760
Manny?

32:43.830 --> 32:46.930
(howling continues)

32:47.000 --> 32:48.260
(Manny)
Help, let me go!

32:48.330 --> 32:50.470
(woman)
Let's go!
Let me go!

32:50.530 --> 32:51.870
Help, please!

32:51.930 --> 32:53.370
What do you want?!

32:53.440 --> 32:55.240
Rufus?

32:55.300 --> 32:57.010
What's wrong?
Manny's in trouble.

33:00.340 --> 33:01.480
Manny?!

33:01.540 --> 33:02.750
Manny?!

33:02.810 --> 33:03.750
Paige...

33:03.810 --> 33:04.660
(tires screeching)

33:04.720 --> 33:06.010
... those men just
took my best friend

33:06.080 --> 33:07.380
but why would they...

33:08.650 --> 33:10.520
They're working for
the squirrels, aren't they?

33:10.590 --> 33:11.750
No, Rufus.

33:11.820 --> 33:13.090
This is why.

33:14.420 --> 33:16.460
All right, I'll bite.

33:16.530 --> 33:17.890
What do you
want with me?

33:17.960 --> 33:19.090
With you?

33:20.160 --> 33:21.800
(chuckling)

33:21.860 --> 33:23.470
Nothing.

33:23.530 --> 33:24.630
Nothing at all.

33:26.030 --> 33:27.140
Think about it.

33:27.270 --> 33:28.800
This magic thing,
this amulet

33:28.870 --> 33:29.870
must have
incredible power

33:29.940 --> 33:31.110
and be crazy valuable,

33:31.170 --> 33:33.110
so someone must be
looking for it.

33:33.180 --> 33:35.410
Rufus, we gotta
find Manny right away!

33:35.480 --> 33:36.650
I can do that!

33:36.710 --> 33:38.150
(sniffing)

33:38.280 --> 33:39.520
But not with
this nose.

33:39.580 --> 33:40.520
Follow me.

33:42.120 --> 33:43.420
(barking)

33:53.600 --> 33:55.300
(barking)

33:55.330 --> 33:56.600
Rufus, wait for me!

33:58.330 --> 34:00.040
(Manny)
Where are you taking me?

34:00.100 --> 34:03.210
(Mr. Black)
To a place your dear Rufus

34:03.310 --> 34:05.340
won't be able
to resist.

34:11.909 --> 34:13.050
We've gotta
find that dog.

34:13.120 --> 34:14.320
Manny will be crushed!

34:14.320 --> 34:15.820
Crushed!
Get a grip!

34:15.880 --> 34:17.350
Do not go
soft on me!

34:19.719 --> 34:20.790
(whimpering)

34:22.090 --> 34:23.560
Come on, Rufus,
don't lose the scent.

34:23.630 --> 34:24.690
You can do this.

34:24.760 --> 34:25.929
Find Manny.

34:25.989 --> 34:27.330
Go, Rufus!

34:27.360 --> 34:28.760
I don't like
the looks of this place.

34:32.159 --> 34:33.120
Ha.

34:33.199 --> 34:34.969
You drag me into a creepy
warehouse

34:35.040 --> 34:36.710
in the middle of nowhere
and think I'm gonna worry?

34:36.770 --> 34:38.940
My best friend will find me
wherever you take me.

34:39.010 --> 34:41.179
Oh, we're
counting on that.

34:42.219 --> 34:43.400
Oh.

34:44.409 --> 34:47.020
This is a trap
and I'm the bait.

34:47.080 --> 34:48.480
Clever boy.

34:48.550 --> 34:50.790
But children
should be seen...

34:50.850 --> 34:51.790
(muffled shouting)

34:51.850 --> 34:52.960
... and not heard.

34:53.020 --> 34:54.360
(muffled shouting)

34:54.360 --> 34:57.860
I understand a certain
K-9 with a very...

34:57.930 --> 34:59.360
**

35:01.400 --> 35:02.470
I found him!

35:02.530 --> 35:03.870
I found him,
Manny's in there.

35:03.930 --> 35:04.780
(sniffing)

35:04.840 --> 35:06.170
Oh, I smell
my favorite snack.

35:06.200 --> 35:08.400
Power Puppy Kibble.

35:08.470 --> 35:10.170
My nose
is never wrong.

35:10.170 --> 35:12.410
It must be in that huge
barrel of dog food.

35:12.480 --> 35:13.980
Shh, Rufus.

35:14.040 --> 35:16.080
They took Manny
knowing you'd come for him.

35:16.180 --> 35:18.450
They're expecting you
and the amulet.

35:24.090 --> 35:25.320
I got an idea.

35:25.390 --> 35:27.360
Let's give them
something they don't expect.

35:27.420 --> 35:28.420
Yeah.

35:29.730 --> 35:31.260
**

35:33.700 --> 35:36.730
Eight years I've been
hunting down that amulet...

35:36.800 --> 35:38.930
across six continents.

35:39.000 --> 35:41.340
But now
I'm not pursuing it.

35:41.400 --> 35:44.710
It's being delivered to
me on a silver platter.

35:44.770 --> 35:48.710
Or should I say
a golden Labrador?

35:48.780 --> 35:50.280
(laughing maniacally)

35:51.550 --> 35:52.480
Excuse me.

35:53.680 --> 35:55.850
Are you the owner
and/or proprietor

35:55.920 --> 35:57.290
of this property?

35:57.350 --> 36:00.220
May I ask
who's inquiring?

36:00.290 --> 36:01.890
Paige Prescott,
ace reporter.

36:01.960 --> 36:03.130
My paper's
doing a feature:

36:03.230 --> 36:05.090
"Wild Warehouses
Of The Westside."

36:05.230 --> 36:06.230
Who lives here?

36:06.230 --> 36:07.860
Why live here?

36:07.930 --> 36:10.000
Could I get
a quick comment?

36:10.070 --> 36:11.600
Unfortunately...

36:13.140 --> 36:14.600
... we have no comment.

36:17.010 --> 36:19.380
Now, off you go,
little girl.

36:19.440 --> 36:21.940
This can be
a very unsafe place

36:22.010 --> 36:24.050
and we have work to do.

36:24.110 --> 36:25.080
(barking)

36:25.150 --> 36:26.720
You!
Now, Rufus!

36:30.920 --> 36:33.660
(yelling)

36:33.720 --> 36:34.660
(laughing)

36:38.960 --> 36:40.700
(barking)
There it is!

36:40.760 --> 36:42.270
(growling)

36:43.330 --> 36:44.630
Get that dog!

36:48.370 --> 36:50.710
(weapon powering up)

36:50.770 --> 36:51.840
(muffled shouting)

36:54.840 --> 36:56.180
Hey, you okay?

36:56.280 --> 36:57.760
I'm better now.

36:58.100 --> 36:59.320
(Manny)
Don't worry about it.

36:59.420 --> 37:01.580
I'll get the rest, you go find
Rufus and let's get out of here.

37:03.290 --> 37:04.850
**

37:07.290 --> 37:08.420
(Mr. Black)
Here, Rufus!

37:10.530 --> 37:11.830
I think I hear him.

37:11.890 --> 37:13.030
It sounds
like he's over here.

37:15.030 --> 37:16.300
Uh-oh.

37:19.300 --> 37:20.370
Uh-uh-uh-uh.

37:21.670 --> 37:24.510
You're not going anywhere
until we find that dog.

37:26.240 --> 37:27.340
Stay.

37:27.540 --> 37:29.480
Or I'll make you stay.

37:29.550 --> 37:30.650
(chuckling)

37:32.150 --> 37:34.620
(groaning)
Hey...

37:34.680 --> 37:36.150
(machine whirring)

37:36.220 --> 37:38.450
Hey, hey, hey!

37:38.520 --> 37:39.860
(shouting)

37:41.860 --> 37:44.130
(Dad)
Turn right here!
(Mom)
Okay, I'm turning,
I'm turning!

37:45.960 --> 37:47.230
What is this place?

37:52.140 --> 37:53.140
Rufus?

37:53.170 --> 37:54.140
Rufus, come.

37:54.170 --> 37:55.140
(whimpering)

37:55.170 --> 37:56.510
**

37:59.180 --> 38:01.040
(laughing)

38:01.140 --> 38:02.250
Rufus, shake.

38:03.710 --> 38:06.250
Look, man, I'm sorry about
what I said at the dance.

38:06.320 --> 38:07.980
I should've known
you would never hurt me.

38:08.050 --> 38:10.290
Whatever I am,
boy or dog,

38:10.350 --> 38:11.750
always remember,
Manny...

38:13.320 --> 38:14.560
... I just wanna
be your friend.

38:16.630 --> 38:17.560
I...

38:17.630 --> 38:18.930
You do not
lick my face.

38:20.400 --> 38:22.270
So have we kicked
enough butt here?

38:22.330 --> 38:25.370
Violence as a means
to resolve conflict.

38:25.430 --> 38:29.370
Children, what are they
teaching you in school?

38:29.440 --> 38:31.840
Oh, uh,
uh, uh, uh...

38:31.910 --> 38:33.780
gym, math, his-history--

38:33.840 --> 38:37.280
I wish I could end this in
a more civilized manner,

38:37.350 --> 38:41.820
but I want that amulet
in the worst possible way.

38:44.990 --> 38:47.790
Now, who wants
a doggy nap?
(weapon powering up)

38:56.670 --> 38:58.370
**

38:58.430 --> 39:00.040
Eeny...

39:00.200 --> 39:02.440
meeny...

39:02.510 --> 39:03.440
miny...

39:05.240 --> 39:06.210
... boy!

39:06.240 --> 39:07.580
Manny!

39:08.940 --> 39:09.880
No!

39:09.950 --> 39:10.950
(chuckling)

39:11.010 --> 39:12.550
(whimpering)

39:13.950 --> 39:15.080
Now give me
that amulet!

39:15.220 --> 39:16.490
Sorry to
crush your dream.

39:18.890 --> 39:20.360
(screaming)

39:21.690 --> 39:22.730
(laughing)

39:23.990 --> 39:25.060
Oh no.
Rufus.

39:25.130 --> 39:26.230
(whimpering)

39:26.230 --> 39:27.660
No, you can't
leave me.

39:29.230 --> 39:30.600
(Manny)
You gotta be okay.

39:31.970 --> 39:33.270
You're
my best friend.

39:34.740 --> 39:35.900
My best friend.

39:37.370 --> 39:39.240
(whimpering)

39:41.710 --> 39:43.310
(crying)

39:45.580 --> 39:46.520
Dude?

39:50.290 --> 39:51.490
It didn't
even hit you.

39:52.560 --> 39:53.720
Get up, you big baby.

39:53.790 --> 39:56.530
(barking)
Oh, Rufus, you're okay.

39:56.590 --> 39:58.590
Come on, buddy.
You're fine, Rufus.

39:58.660 --> 40:00.400
(barking)
(laughing)

40:02.670 --> 40:04.330
Oh...

40:04.400 --> 40:06.770
He may be okay but
the amulet is done for.

40:09.170 --> 40:11.110
I guess Rufus is
stuck being a dog.

40:11.170 --> 40:12.880
Not just any dog.

40:12.940 --> 40:13.880
My best friend.

40:18.010 --> 40:18.950
Oh...

40:19.010 --> 40:20.150
Oh, Rufus,
is all right.

40:20.220 --> 40:21.450
What a relief.

40:21.520 --> 40:23.490
(Mr. Black groaning)

40:24.590 --> 40:25.790
Rufus may be fine,

40:25.850 --> 40:27.590
but something else
here sure isn't.

40:31.930 --> 40:33.360
Hello, police.

40:33.430 --> 40:35.340
Manny, are you
all right, son?

40:35.800 --> 40:37.830
Yeah, I'm better, Dad.

40:37.900 --> 40:40.240
(laughing)

40:40.300 --> 40:41.540
Better than ever.

40:45.040 --> 40:47.910
(Mr. Black)
We barely escaped before
the authorities arrived!

40:49.180 --> 40:50.510
If you let me live,

40:50.580 --> 40:53.120
I will do everything in my
power to help you

40:53.180 --> 40:54.850
fulfill your
master plan.

40:54.920 --> 40:55.980
(chattering)

40:56.050 --> 40:58.290
You failed me
for the last time.

40:58.350 --> 40:59.360
Idiot!

40:59.420 --> 41:01.160
(screaming)

41:01.220 --> 41:04.830
(laughing maniacally)

41:07.100 --> 41:09.770
(Manny)
Get it, boy, get it,
boy, get it, boy!

41:09.830 --> 41:10.830
Get it, boy!

41:10.900 --> 41:12.380
Get the ball,
get the ball.

41:13.340 --> 41:14.540
(barking)

41:15.140 --> 41:17.340
That is one
happy hound.
Yeah.

41:17.410 --> 41:18.510
(barking)

41:18.570 --> 41:21.010
So nobody legit
will run your story?

41:21.080 --> 41:23.350
"The Crazy World Weekly"
was very interested.

41:23.380 --> 41:26.350
"The New York Times,"
not so much.

41:26.420 --> 41:28.380
The story
of a lifetime.

41:28.450 --> 41:30.520
Pulitzer Prize material.

41:30.590 --> 41:32.360
And no one believes
a single word of it.

41:32.360 --> 41:34.520
If I hadn't lived it,
I wouldn't believe it myself.

41:34.590 --> 41:35.620
(barking)

41:35.690 --> 41:36.890
There'll be
other stories.

41:36.960 --> 41:38.090
You'll get your
Pulitzer.

41:40.000 --> 41:41.860
Do you think
he misses being a boy?

41:41.930 --> 41:43.500
(growling)

41:43.570 --> 41:45.100
Rufus said it himself.

41:45.170 --> 41:47.700
Boy or a dog, he just
wants to be my friend.

41:51.240 --> 41:52.380
And, you know, who knows?

41:52.380 --> 41:54.640
Maybe he'll be
a boy again someday.

41:54.710 --> 41:56.280
Stranger things
have happened.

41:56.380 --> 41:58.110
**

41:59.650 --> 42:01.250
Get it, boy,
get the ball!

42:01.380 --> 42:02.390
(barking)

42:02.450 --> 42:04.750
(laughing)

42:09.430 --> 42:10.390
(Manny)
Come on, come on, Rufus!

42:10.430 --> 42:11.560
(barking)

42:12.830 --> 42:13.760
(barking rhythmically)

42:13.830 --> 42:14.760
* Hey *

42:14.830 --> 42:15.860
(barking rhythmically)

42:15.930 --> 42:16.870

42:16.930 --> 42:17.930
(barking rhythmically)

42:18.000 --> 42:19.200

42:19.270 --> 42:21.870
(barking rhythmically)

42:21.940 --> 42:22.870
* Hey *

42:22.940 --> 42:23.870
(barking rhythmically)

42:23.940 --> 42:24.870
* Hey *

42:24.940 --> 42:26.940
(barking rhythmically)

42:27.010 --> 42:28.640
* You think
you're top dog *

42:32.010 --> 42:33.780
* Ho *

42:33.850 --> 42:34.950
* Roor *

42:35.020 --> 42:36.590
* You think
you're top dog *

42:40.290 --> 42:41.420
(barking rhythmically)

42:42.630 --> 42:44.560
* You think
you're top dog *

42:44.630 --> 42:45.630
(barking rhythmically)

42:48.300 --> 42:49.430
(barking rhythmically)

42:49.500 --> 42:50.430
* Roor *

42:51.700 --> 42:52.770
* Go *

42:52.840 --> 42:54.240
(barking rhythmically)

42:56.140 --> 42:57.440
* Roor *

43:01.110 --> 43:03.010
* In the house
on the street *

43:03.080 --> 43:05.010
* On the block
off the leash *

43:05.080 --> 43:06.750
(barking rhythmically)

43:08.050 --> 43:09.180
* Ho *

43:10.650 --> 43:12.190
(barking)

43:12.250 --> 43:13.460
* All right *

43:14.490 --> 43:15.660
(barking rhythmically)

43:17.690 --> 43:18.460
* Roor *

43:18.530 --> 43:19.730
(barking rhythmically)

43:22.470 --> 43:23.530
(barking rhythmically)

43:23.600 --> 43:24.900
* Ho *

43:24.970 --> 43:26.870
* You think you're top dog *

43:26.940 --> 43:28.700
(barking rhythmically)

43:29.970 --> 43:31.040
* Roor *

43:31.110 --> 43:32.680
* You think you're top dog *

43:32.740 --> 43:36.240
* Go, go, go,
go, go, go, go *

43:36.310 --> 43:39.850
* Go, go, go, go,
go, go, go **

43:39.920 --> 43:42.590
(dog howling)
