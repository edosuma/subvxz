01:04.998 --> 01:06.199
Help!

01:28.756 --> 01:29.724
Help!

01:51.211 --> 01:53.648
Please, please, there's no time.
I've been abducted.

01:53.781 --> 01:55.650
I've been taken
to some crazy island.

01:55.783 --> 01:57.785
<i>I know where you are.</i>

01:57.919 --> 01:59.353
<i>Stay there. I will send help.</i>

01:59.486 --> 02:01.623
Thank you. Thank you so much.

02:03.390 --> 02:05.994
You have to hurry, you have
to hurry, you have to hurry.

02:06.126 --> 02:09.564
<i>It will all be fine,
Mrs. Maddison.</i>

02:09.697 --> 02:10.931
Wait.

02:12.066 --> 02:13.266
How do you know my name?

02:13.400 --> 02:14.602
<i>You are one of my guests.</i>

02:26.781 --> 02:29.316
No, no, no! No!

02:29.449 --> 02:32.285
No! No! No, stop!

02:32.419 --> 02:35.857
Let go of me!
Let me go! Let me go!

02:38.291 --> 02:40.293
<i>Please let me go!</i>

02:58.513 --> 03:00.048
The plane.

03:23.805 --> 03:26.107
Mr. Roarke, the plane.

03:26.239 --> 03:27.542
It's here.

03:41.122 --> 03:42.690
Smiles, everyone.

03:43.858 --> 03:45.760
Smiles.

03:50.698 --> 03:52.967
Well...

03:53.101 --> 03:56.236
this place doesn't suck.

04:00.608 --> 04:02.543
YO...

04:02.677 --> 04:04.579
- LO!
- Ha-ha-ha!

04:04.712 --> 04:06.781
Oh, my... Unh!

04:06.914 --> 04:09.717
- This is crazy.
- Thanks.

04:09.851 --> 04:12.352
- Free flower necklaces.
- Ooh, welcome drinks.

04:12.486 --> 04:15.056
Ha, let's get lei'd!

04:16.524 --> 04:18.425
Here, let me give you a hand.

04:18.559 --> 04:21.028
- I'm okay.
- No, no, come on. I insist.

04:21.161 --> 04:22.597
- Oh!
- Ha, ha!

04:22.730 --> 04:24.899
It was so loud in there.
I'm Patrick.

04:25.032 --> 04:27.300
- I'm Gwen. Nice to meet you.
- Nice to meet you.

04:27.434 --> 04:29.670
Welcome to Fantasy Island.

04:29.804 --> 04:32.840
And congratulations to each
of you on winning the contest.

04:32.974 --> 04:35.009
This weekend,
you will be our VIPs.

04:35.143 --> 04:36.911
In return, all we ask

04:37.044 --> 04:38.913
is that you brag
about us online

04:39.046 --> 04:40.748
- when you get home.
- Marketing 101.

04:40.882 --> 04:42.750
I'm Julia,
the personal assistant

04:42.884 --> 04:44.252
to your host, Mr. Roarke.

04:44.417 --> 04:45.753
Yeah, what's his story?

04:45.887 --> 04:47.221
I couldn't begin to tell you.

04:47.354 --> 04:49.289
I heard Roarke's family
bought this island

04:49.422 --> 04:52.059
from the natives 200 years ago
for six cases of rum.

04:52.193 --> 04:55.096
I heard that he was
an angel investor in the '90s

04:55.229 --> 04:56.998
and got bored
with Silicon Valley.

04:57.131 --> 04:58.800
And opened an amusement park?

04:58.933 --> 05:01.102
Trust me, the island
is so much more.

05:01.235 --> 05:03.971
Here, anything and everything
is possible.

05:04.105 --> 05:05.438
Oh, yes. Unh!

05:05.573 --> 05:07.208
You guys high-five a lot?

05:07.340 --> 05:08.843
- All the time.
- All the time, baby.

05:08.976 --> 05:10.511
- Wow.
- Mr. Roarke is making

05:10.645 --> 05:12.847
final preparations.
He will meet you in the bar

05:12.980 --> 05:14.749
for an evening drink.
In the meantime,

05:14.882 --> 05:16.584
we will take you to your rooms,

05:16.717 --> 05:19.486
so you may change
and freshen up.

05:19.620 --> 05:21.189
No service.

05:21.321 --> 05:23.758
Guess not everything's possible.

05:32.166 --> 05:34.467
Gentlemen, I'll ask
you to wait at the bar.

05:34.602 --> 05:36.737
Your quarters will be
ready shortly.

05:36.871 --> 05:38.906
And the rest of you,
please follow me.

05:39.040 --> 05:40.440
Your bungalows are this way.

05:40.575 --> 05:42.310
- Dude!
- Ha!

05:42.442 --> 05:45.445
This is... Wow, I can't believe
you get to bring me.

05:45.580 --> 05:47.281
Come on. It wouldn't be
a dream vacay

05:47.414 --> 05:49.617
without my baby bro.
Right? Oh!

06:03.231 --> 06:04.665
Oh.

06:04.799 --> 06:06.234
Here you go.

06:06.366 --> 06:08.435
There's no need for money here.

06:17.678 --> 06:19.513
Mm.

06:42.003 --> 06:45.206
Wow. Is this just for me?

06:45.339 --> 06:48.408
Well, it's called
Fantasy Island for a reason.

06:48.542 --> 06:49.710
A place where anything

06:49.844 --> 06:52.947
and everything is
possible, you said.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.583
What you didn't say is how.

06:55.716 --> 06:59.186
Mr. Roarke tailors each fantasy
specifically to the guest.

06:59.320 --> 07:00.821
Based on
a one-page questionnaire?

07:00.955 --> 07:03.658
I will confess,
I'm relatively new here.

07:03.791 --> 07:06.260
So how Mr. Roarke does
what he does

07:06.394 --> 07:09.563
is as much a mystery to me
as it is to you.

07:10.798 --> 07:12.767
What I do know...

07:14.535 --> 07:18.471
is that your life is about
to change forever.

07:21.709 --> 07:23.044
I hope you're ready.

08:47.828 --> 08:49.663
- Here you are.
- I will take two of those.

08:49.797 --> 08:52.266
- Thank you.
- Oh, great. I need a drink.

08:52.400 --> 08:55.269
Mm, sorry, I'm double-fisting.

08:55.403 --> 08:57.405
Mm, uh, can we talk
to Mr. Roarke, please?

08:57.538 --> 08:59.907
We still don't have our rooms.
Sir? Hello?

09:00.041 --> 09:01.709
Hey, my brother's talking
to you.

09:01.842 --> 09:03.377
- I'm his brother. Hello?
- Wait.

09:03.512 --> 09:04.979
You guys are actually brothers?

09:05.112 --> 09:07.148
Oh, you think because
we're different colors

09:07.281 --> 09:08.416
- we can't be brothers?
- Wow.

09:08.549 --> 09:11.619
- Dude, racist much?
- No. I mean...

09:11.752 --> 09:13.254
- What's up?
- What do you mean?

09:13.387 --> 09:14.755
- Come on.
- You don't like Asians?

09:14.889 --> 09:17.091
- Why do you hate Asians?
- That's not what I said.

09:17.224 --> 09:20.895
Verbatim what you said.
You got a racist haircut.

09:22.663 --> 09:25.032
- Look at his face.
- I'm just joking, man. No.

09:25.166 --> 09:26.367
My dad married his mom

09:26.501 --> 09:28.503
when this little dude
was still in Pampers.

09:28.636 --> 09:31.540
- I'm JD. You can call him "T."
- Dude.

09:31.672 --> 09:33.074
- What?
- We talked about this.

09:33.207 --> 09:34.642
- Whatever.
- College nickname.

09:34.775 --> 09:37.311
- "Brax" is fine.
- Patrick. Nice to meet you guys.

09:37.445 --> 09:39.480
You boys can always take
Patrick's bungalow

09:39.613 --> 09:42.583
and he can "bungalow" with me.

09:42.716 --> 09:45.520
I'm Melanie. I don't think
we had a chance to meet.

09:45.653 --> 09:47.822
- It was pretty noisy.
- I can get pretty noisy.

09:47.955 --> 09:51.058
- Damn.
- You are forward, Melanie.

09:51.192 --> 09:53.894
You have no idea, Patrick.

09:54.028 --> 09:55.763
So, what's your fantasy?

09:58.399 --> 10:01.902
Oh, that's a question
for the room.

10:02.036 --> 10:03.505
I'm curious how this all works.

10:03.637 --> 10:04.939
I was wondering that myself.

10:05.072 --> 10:06.640
Virtual reality,
obviously.

10:06.774 --> 10:09.076
Maybe it's like LARP,
live-action role-playing.

10:09.210 --> 10:10.579
It's actually pretty fun.

10:11.779 --> 10:12.646
So I've heard.

10:12.780 --> 10:15.049
From, like, dorks. Heh.

10:15.182 --> 10:16.217
- You saved it.
- Thank you.

10:16.350 --> 10:17.785
I bet he's right. It's gotta be

10:17.918 --> 10:19.487
some sort
of immersive experience.

10:19.620 --> 10:22.123
What if your fantasy involves
a person from your life?

10:22.256 --> 10:24.225
Holograms, like Tupac.

10:24.358 --> 10:26.727
- What if it's somebody who died?
- Tupac.

10:26.861 --> 10:28.963
I saw on Reddit
that the guy pumps the drinks

10:29.096 --> 10:31.632
with tons of hallucinogens.
Crazy.

10:34.135 --> 10:35.736
I promise,

10:35.870 --> 10:37.705
the only thing in those drinks

10:37.838 --> 10:40.007
is the finest imported rum.

10:40.141 --> 10:41.775
Good evening. I am Mr. Roarke,

10:41.909 --> 10:43.944
the ambassador
to your deepest desires.

10:44.078 --> 10:47.047
Let me officially welcome you
to Fantasy Island.

10:47.181 --> 10:48.349
- Hey, hey!
- Yeah!

10:48.482 --> 10:49.483
Thank you, Mr. Roarke.

10:49.618 --> 10:50.885
We were all just discussing

10:51.018 --> 10:53.020
- how this works exactly.
- You will know soon.

10:53.154 --> 10:54.889
I promise,
you won't be disappointed.

10:55.022 --> 10:56.625
The island has two rules.

10:56.757 --> 10:58.826
There is only one fantasy
per guest.

10:58.959 --> 11:01.530
And two, you must see
your fantasy through

11:01.662 --> 11:04.165
to its natural conclusion,
no matter what.

11:04.298 --> 11:06.635
- Why wouldn't we?
- Fantasies rarely play out

11:06.767 --> 11:08.035
as you or I might expect,

11:08.169 --> 11:10.938
but they always play out
exactly as they should.

11:11.071 --> 11:12.673
Not even you know
how they'll go?

11:12.806 --> 11:13.841
Only the island knows.

11:13.974 --> 11:15.544
I am but its humble steward.

11:15.676 --> 11:18.479
- So when does this all begin?
- After a good night's rest.

11:18.613 --> 11:20.981
Oh. My brother and I still
don't have our rooms.

11:21.115 --> 11:24.785
I hope the "island" is ready for
a tough but fair Yelp review.

11:24.919 --> 11:26.820
That's because, gentlemen,

11:26.954 --> 11:29.156
your fantasy begins now.

11:31.158 --> 11:33.160
- How far is this place?
- Yeah.

11:33.294 --> 11:34.962
Not really into bushwhacking.

11:35.095 --> 11:37.532
- Is that why Jenni dumped you?
- Too soon, T. Come on.

11:37.666 --> 11:40.434
Stop with the nickname.
I'm not playing.

11:40.569 --> 11:42.369
We are very close.

11:42.504 --> 11:44.038
You wrote on your questionnaire

11:44.171 --> 11:46.073
your fantasy was
to have it all, no?

11:46.207 --> 11:48.742
- Yeah.
- Well...

11:48.876 --> 11:50.512
it's all yours.

11:59.920 --> 12:02.624
Hey! Oh!

12:02.756 --> 12:04.458
Oh, my God!

12:04.593 --> 12:06.528
Oh, he did a backflip!
He did it!

12:13.033 --> 12:15.769
Oh! Super on-the-nose,
Roarke,

12:15.903 --> 12:18.272
but I still love it.
Ha-ha-ha!

12:18.405 --> 12:21.742
- Champagne, boys?
- Not for me. Asian glow.

12:21.875 --> 12:25.112
Roarke, don't forget what I told
you about my baby brother Brax.

12:25.246 --> 12:27.682
- Told him you're gay.
- How could I?

12:29.651 --> 12:31.952
Oh, you think being gay
means all I want

12:32.086 --> 12:35.889
is shirtless, ripped,
juicy, delicious men?

12:36.023 --> 12:37.891
I got layers, dudes.

12:42.896 --> 12:44.733
Two layers. I got two layers.

12:44.865 --> 12:46.568
Fantasy fucking Island!

12:47.702 --> 12:49.069
If you need me,

12:49.203 --> 12:51.438
just pick up any phone.

12:51.573 --> 12:54.275
- Enjoy your evening.
- Oh, we will.

13:42.590 --> 13:44.559
This is some good weed.

13:55.869 --> 13:57.338
- Good morning.
- Aah! Oh!

13:59.006 --> 14:01.643
Mr. Roarke has called for you.

14:05.346 --> 14:07.549
Ms. Olsen, please, sit.

14:07.682 --> 14:09.316
Thank you, Mr. Roarke.

14:09.450 --> 14:11.919
I've been helping people realize
their fantasies

14:12.052 --> 14:14.988
for longer than I care to say.

14:15.122 --> 14:18.959
Often, they are
painfully unimaginative.

14:19.093 --> 14:20.562
- Lots of sex stuff.
- Yeah.

14:20.695 --> 14:23.197
But yours...
Yours is quite abstract.

14:23.330 --> 14:27.034
You wrote, "Happiness and I
aren't exactly compatible.

14:27.167 --> 14:29.870
Now, mistakes and regrets,
we're old friends.

14:30.003 --> 14:33.508
So if I had one wish, I guess
it would be to get a do-over."

14:33.641 --> 14:35.710
Is it too late
to change to sex stuff?

14:35.844 --> 14:37.311
No, no, no. I like this.

14:37.444 --> 14:40.682
This is a challenge.
And I accept.

14:40.815 --> 14:42.149
Oh, good.

14:42.282 --> 14:43.984
What do you not like
about your life?

14:44.118 --> 14:46.320
Let us start with your job.
Real estate.

14:46.453 --> 14:49.423
Mostly commercial.
I mean, what's to like?

14:49.557 --> 14:51.392
Relationship?

14:53.227 --> 14:55.295
Single.

14:55.429 --> 14:56.930
- Do you want children?
- I'm sorry,

14:57.064 --> 14:59.233
is this a therapy session
or a vacation?

14:59.366 --> 15:00.467
If you're lucky, both.

15:03.904 --> 15:07.742
I always pictured myself with...

15:07.876 --> 15:10.377
just one little girl.

15:10.512 --> 15:13.147
And with whom did you hope
to have this little girl?

15:14.883 --> 15:16.283
Ms. Olsen...

15:17.484 --> 15:20.220
regret... is a disease.

15:20.354 --> 15:22.690
It has afflicted you
for too long,

15:22.824 --> 15:25.894
and I can help you cure it.

15:26.026 --> 15:26.960
If you let me.

15:29.163 --> 15:31.932
- His name was Allen.
- Very good.

15:32.065 --> 15:34.636
And why did it not work
with Mr. Allen?

15:34.769 --> 15:38.740
Bad timing. When we met,
I was kind of in a dark place.

15:38.873 --> 15:42.544
At our one-year anniversary
dinner, he proposed.

15:42.677 --> 15:44.445
I said no.

15:46.046 --> 15:48.081
You did not believe
Allen loved you

15:48.215 --> 15:51.418
because you do not believe
you deserve love.

15:54.388 --> 15:57.826
If you could
do that moment over,

15:57.958 --> 15:59.293
would you say yes?

16:01.596 --> 16:02.496
Yeah.

16:06.233 --> 16:08.202
Behind those doors...

16:08.335 --> 16:10.337
is your fantasy.

16:10.471 --> 16:13.875
A chance to change
the moment you regret the most.

16:16.477 --> 16:18.045
Madame.

16:37.632 --> 16:39.132
What is that?

16:39.266 --> 16:41.603
Ms. Olsen, please.

16:41.736 --> 16:43.337
The doors.

16:58.653 --> 17:00.655
Maestro's?

17:02.289 --> 17:03.423
Down to the last detail.

17:03.558 --> 17:05.259
- How did you...?
- Yes.

17:05.392 --> 17:08.695
Yes, and this is
where Mr. Allen proposed.

17:10.632 --> 17:12.599
You flew him in?

17:12.733 --> 17:15.269
- You knew?
- Almost thought you stood me up.

17:15.402 --> 17:17.037
Ah.
Reservation under Chambers.

17:17.170 --> 17:18.705
Yes, sir.

17:20.508 --> 17:21.509
Right this way.

17:25.780 --> 17:29.249
- Allen, I'm so sorry...
- For what?

17:29.383 --> 17:32.587
Well, that they dragged you
into this. I can't...

17:32.720 --> 17:34.856
Oh, God. You didn't
pay to get here, did you?

17:34.989 --> 17:39.192
No. My cabbie was just like,
"No charge, man. It's cool."

17:39.326 --> 17:41.261
What...?

17:41.395 --> 17:42.496
Enjoy your meal.

17:49.336 --> 17:52.807
You can drop the act now.

17:52.941 --> 17:54.742
I don't speak to you
for five years,

17:54.876 --> 17:57.879
and you just show up here,
looking...

17:58.012 --> 18:00.447
great, by the way.
You haven't aged a day.

18:00.582 --> 18:03.317
I saw you in my bed
this morning.

18:03.450 --> 18:05.252
Is this an intervention?

18:05.385 --> 18:08.656
You role-play with me and
I learn something about myself?

18:08.790 --> 18:11.258
Okay, when and where
did you bump your head today?

18:11.391 --> 18:13.895
Seriously, you okay?

18:14.028 --> 18:15.897
Will you excuse me?

18:19.767 --> 18:22.169
This is not what I wanted.

18:22.302 --> 18:24.872
This is your second chance
to say yes

18:25.006 --> 18:27.575
- to his marriage proposal.
- But what is the point?

18:27.709 --> 18:29.043
It doesn't change anything.

18:29.176 --> 18:32.245
You are here because
regret has ruined your life.

18:32.379 --> 18:34.616
Do not make this another moment
you will regret.

18:34.749 --> 18:36.283
But...

18:37.619 --> 18:39.854
...it's not real.

18:39.988 --> 18:41.823
- Is it?
- This is Fantasy Island.

18:43.691 --> 18:45.994
It's as real as you make it.

18:48.062 --> 18:49.831
Guess they're saving
the best for last.

18:49.964 --> 18:51.566
Your fantasy hasn't
started either?

18:51.699 --> 18:54.267
- No. Mind if I join you?
- Please.

18:54.401 --> 18:57.437
This guy's been
giving me nothing.

18:57.572 --> 19:00.207
- Would you like a cocktail, sir?
- Oh, no, thanks.

19:01.341 --> 19:02.810
- You nervous?
- A little.

19:02.944 --> 19:05.312
Well, I'd ask you
about your fantasy again,

19:05.445 --> 19:08.616
but you didn't really want to
talk about it last night, so...

19:08.750 --> 19:10.350
This is gonna sound stupid.

19:10.484 --> 19:14.321
Ever since I was a kid,
I wanted to enlist.

19:14.454 --> 19:19.159
But my mom made me promise that
I wouldn't, so I became a cop.

19:19.292 --> 19:21.629
Figured I'd do some good,
see some action.

19:21.763 --> 19:23.698
- But you didn't?
- No. There was an incident.

19:23.831 --> 19:24.899
Got stuck behind a desk.

19:25.033 --> 19:26.534
When this came around,
I figured:

19:26.668 --> 19:28.168
"This is my chance
to play soldier,"

19:28.301 --> 19:31.539
even if it's just actors
with blanks and...

19:31.673 --> 19:33.440
Never enlisted?

19:33.574 --> 19:35.175
What's up with the dog tags?

19:35.308 --> 19:36.978
Uh, for luck.

19:37.111 --> 19:40.480
Well, if you're worried
<i>your</i> fantasy sounds stupid,

19:40.615 --> 19:43.518
just wait
until you hear mine.

19:43.651 --> 19:45.953
- Revenge on a childhood bully.
- You got bullied?

19:46.087 --> 19:49.189
I was a very late bloomer.

19:49.322 --> 19:50.792
Built like a small boy.

19:50.925 --> 19:53.628
So when the most popular girl
in school decided

19:53.761 --> 19:56.631
to make me her favorite target,
I didn't take it well.

19:56.764 --> 19:59.433
I'm not sure how you should take
a bucket of toilet water

19:59.567 --> 20:01.102
on your head
at the eighth-grade dance.

20:01.234 --> 20:03.437
- That's terrible.
- I was having a lot of anxiety,

20:03.571 --> 20:05.573
so my mom forced me
to go see this shrink,

20:05.707 --> 20:08.876
aka Dr. Torture.
Sometimes he talked so much,

20:09.010 --> 20:12.446
I wanted to staple his mouth
shut. Anyway, Dr. Torture,

20:12.580 --> 20:14.448
he told me to write letters
to classmates

20:14.582 --> 20:16.283
that I wanted to connect with.

20:16.416 --> 20:18.052
It was, like, an exercise.

20:18.186 --> 20:22.222
And one day, Sloane,
my tormentor, stole the letters

20:22.355 --> 20:25.093
and then plastered them
all over the cafeteria.

20:25.225 --> 20:29.664
Yeah, I was branded
"psycho stalker freak" for life.

20:29.797 --> 20:32.667
I just want to feel what it's
like to be on the other end.

20:32.800 --> 20:35.503
I mean, obviously,
the fantasy won't be real,

20:35.636 --> 20:37.605
but that's why
we go to horror movies

20:37.739 --> 20:40.708
and ride roller coasters, right?
To feel something?

20:40.842 --> 20:42.910
I'd like to
think that this is...

20:43.044 --> 20:45.046
more exciting
than riding a roller coaster.

20:45.179 --> 20:47.447
Mr. Sullivan, do you mind
giving us some privacy?

20:47.582 --> 20:49.784
I need to give
Ms. Cole instructions.

20:49.917 --> 20:55.022
In the meantime, feel free
to do push-ups or crunches.

20:55.156 --> 20:56.958
- Squats, maybe.
- No, it's okay.

20:57.091 --> 20:59.259
He knows about Sloane.
I'm owning it.

20:59.392 --> 21:02.163
Ah! Okay. No exercise.

21:02.295 --> 21:04.966
In the lobby...
there is an elevator.

21:07.568 --> 21:11.438
<i>Inside, push the button
for the floor with no name.</i>

21:15.910 --> 21:19.080
Can I record it with my phone?

21:19.213 --> 21:21.414
- So I can remember it.
- It is your fantasy.

21:49.043 --> 21:50.812
Jeez.

22:09.462 --> 22:11.464
Hello?

22:17.505 --> 22:20.174
<i>Okay, I'm on Fantasy Island.</i>

22:20.308 --> 22:22.475
<i>I'm in a super creepy
control room.</i>

22:22.610 --> 22:24.344
<i>I'm about
to get this thing started.</i>

22:29.349 --> 22:31.519
Huh, there's a lot
of red buttons.

22:33.386 --> 22:36.524
That one's flashing.
Must be the one.

22:38.259 --> 22:39.694
Here we go.

22:42.697 --> 22:44.332
No way.

22:45.700 --> 22:47.301
Sloane?

22:52.607 --> 22:54.842
That is a really good hologram.

22:56.376 --> 22:58.746
Yeah, she looks better
than Tupac.

23:02.850 --> 23:04.719
"Open me."

23:06.721 --> 23:13.060
"A variety of buttons for
a variety of revenge. Enjoy."

23:13.194 --> 23:15.129
Okay, Holo-Sloane.

23:16.264 --> 23:18.431
Let's have some fun.

23:26.674 --> 23:29.043
Oh, my God.

23:29.176 --> 23:31.779
Oh, my God, that was amazing.

23:33.681 --> 23:34.882
Uh...

23:48.396 --> 23:50.798
Toilet water. Yes.

23:50.932 --> 23:53.234
Very eighth-grade dance.

23:53.367 --> 23:56.604
Mama likes. Huh...

23:58.906 --> 24:00.875
Wait, that's Sloane.

24:02.343 --> 24:03.978
Whoa!

24:04.111 --> 24:06.814
Whoa, that is not her husband.

24:10.051 --> 24:11.484
<i>Okay, okay.</i>

24:11.619 --> 24:13.688
My God, that is
so not her husband.

24:13.821 --> 24:15.289
<i>Good.</i>

24:30.137 --> 24:32.173
Oh, shit.

24:36.911 --> 24:39.313
Well, when on Fantasy Island...

24:45.052 --> 24:46.354
That is her husband.

24:53.728 --> 24:55.029
<i>Sloane?</i>

24:55.162 --> 24:56.998
<i>Uh, what the hell is this?</i>

24:57.131 --> 24:58.666
<i>Oh! Is that Greg?</i>

25:00.668 --> 25:03.371
<i>Don't tell me that's where
you've been the last two days.</i>

25:03.504 --> 25:06.340
- "The last two days"?
- <i>How could you do this to me?</i>

25:07.942 --> 25:10.711
- <i>Will you say something?</i>
- Oh, my God.

25:17.485 --> 25:19.320
Um, Roarke?

25:19.453 --> 25:21.722
- Uh, you there? Look, I'm done.
- <i>Let me go!</i>

25:21.856 --> 25:23.591
I get it.
My fantasy was revenge,

25:23.724 --> 25:26.594
but I didn't think
you would actually kidnap her.

25:26.727 --> 25:27.695
Come on.

25:28.796 --> 25:30.097
Hey!

25:31.232 --> 25:32.666
Hey!

25:47.314 --> 25:49.483
- Your fatigues, soldier.
- This is it?

25:49.617 --> 25:52.920
Just put them on. You will know
when your fantasy has begun.

25:57.358 --> 25:59.593
- <i>Call of Duty</i> time.
- Enjoy.

26:39.867 --> 26:41.402
- Hey! What are you doing?
- Shh!

26:41.536 --> 26:43.572
- Whisper.
- You a part of my fantasy?

26:43.704 --> 26:45.439
This place ain't
what you think it is.

26:45.574 --> 26:48.209
People die here.
If you don't listen to me...

26:49.877 --> 26:51.546
Oh, shit.

26:51.679 --> 26:53.914
- Too many of them.
- Huh? Where you going?

26:54.048 --> 26:55.449
- Do I come with you?
- Don't move.

26:55.584 --> 26:57.552
- Hey.
- Don't even think about it.

26:57.685 --> 26:59.787
It's okay. I'm a soldier too.

26:59.920 --> 27:02.656
- What are you doing out here?
- I got separated from my unit.

27:02.790 --> 27:06.160
Didn't know
there was another team.

27:06.293 --> 27:08.062
We're a...

27:08.195 --> 27:09.663
covert operation.

27:09.797 --> 27:12.567
Surprised to see you out here.

27:12.700 --> 27:14.603
I hate surprises.

27:14.735 --> 27:16.270
And liars.

27:16.403 --> 27:18.973
I'm not... Hey, hey.

27:19.106 --> 27:21.308
- No, but this isn't...
- You can tell it to the LT.

27:21.442 --> 27:22.877
- Shut up and walk.
- Hey.

27:24.579 --> 27:26.013
Okay. Heh.

27:26.147 --> 27:29.717
You guys look good.
Really great.

27:29.850 --> 27:31.118
Shh!

27:36.257 --> 27:38.627
Yeah, dude.

27:38.759 --> 27:41.829
- Mm-mm.
- Mm.

27:41.962 --> 27:47.268
So did you have fun with your
boy toy, Alejandro, last night?

27:53.274 --> 27:54.775
I'm surprised
he can still stand.

27:54.909 --> 27:57.178
I'm surprised he wasn't
turned off by your terrible ink.

27:57.311 --> 27:58.879
Can't wait
to get that lasered off.

27:59.013 --> 28:00.347
- Seriously.
- What about you?

28:00.481 --> 28:01.815
- Hm?
- Saw you talking

28:01.949 --> 28:03.350
to Malibu Barbie last night.

28:03.484 --> 28:04.985
- How'd that go?
- Chastity?

28:05.119 --> 28:06.887
Heh, believe me,
the name functions

28:07.021 --> 28:08.956
purely on an ironic level.

28:09.089 --> 28:11.025
We boned. Twice.

28:11.158 --> 28:14.461
- You're finally over Jenni, then?
- Jenni who? Heh!

28:14.596 --> 28:15.896
Chastity?

28:16.030 --> 28:17.064
- Oh.
- Come over here.

28:17.198 --> 28:20.167
- Hi, boys.
- Hey. What's up?

28:20.301 --> 28:22.836
- Come on in.
- Thanks.

28:22.970 --> 28:26.740
So I heard you two had
a crazy night last night.

28:26.874 --> 28:28.909
- Oh, yeah.
- Oh, yeah. Crazy...

28:29.043 --> 28:30.612
- how much he cried.
- What?

28:30.744 --> 28:31.680
- Sorry.
- Ha-ha-ha!

28:31.812 --> 28:33.247
Isn't there some guest-fantasy

28:33.380 --> 28:35.015
confidentiality policy
or something?

28:35.149 --> 28:36.383
- Let me guess.
- Jenni.

28:36.518 --> 28:39.119
- Oh, ha, ha!
- Yeah. It's actually sweet.

28:39.253 --> 28:41.121
She's his moon and his stars.

28:41.255 --> 28:43.525
You know what, Chas?
You suck at keeping secrets.

28:43.658 --> 28:45.226
She broke up with him
because of me.

28:45.359 --> 28:46.794
For the millionth time,
she didn't.

28:46.927 --> 28:48.697
We spent your anniversary
getting high

28:48.829 --> 28:49.863
and playing <i>Mario Kart.</i>

28:49.997 --> 28:51.765
Couldn't you just move
back home?

28:51.899 --> 28:54.603
Our lame-ass parents
disowned him when he came out.

28:54.735 --> 28:57.271
- Seven years ago.
- Gay wasn't cool back then.

28:57.404 --> 28:58.906
Oh. Wouldn't you be happy

28:59.039 --> 29:01.242
if you just, I don't know,
got your own places?

29:01.375 --> 29:03.944
- Seriously, with the questions.
- Dude, she's right.

29:04.078 --> 29:06.046
You put your whole life
on hold for me.

29:06.180 --> 29:09.283
- Maybe I should move out.
- Who'd sleep on the couch then?

29:09.416 --> 29:12.353
No one. That's the point.

29:12.486 --> 29:15.022
Chastity Belt, can you just
give us a little bro time?

29:15.155 --> 29:16.691
- Yeah.
- Thanks so much.

29:16.824 --> 29:18.792
We'll see you in a bit.
Okay.

29:21.462 --> 29:24.265
Little bro, buddy, listen,
that weed's got you "para-nuts."

29:24.398 --> 29:26.900
Look, my life is not on hold
because of you.

29:27.034 --> 29:30.572
It crushes because of you.
Okay? Now, come on.

29:30.705 --> 29:34.074
Let's see what other swag
this house has to offer.

29:34.208 --> 29:35.442
Goodbye, models!

29:35.577 --> 29:36.745
- Bye!
- Bye, guys.

29:36.877 --> 29:38.345
Heh, heh, that's so cool.

29:38.479 --> 29:41.782
There is no excuse for 14 boxes.

29:41.915 --> 29:43.951
It was an intimidating group
of Girl Scouts.

29:44.084 --> 29:45.687
- Fourteen? Ha-ha-ha!
- Fourteen.

29:45.819 --> 29:47.454
I'm telling you,
when we have kids,

29:47.589 --> 29:49.724
I'm gonna be such a pushover.

29:51.892 --> 29:53.628
When we have kids?

29:55.462 --> 29:57.331
I know it's only been a year,

29:57.464 --> 29:59.601
but you make me think
about the future.

29:59.734 --> 30:02.604
Look, it has been amazing
seeing you,

30:02.737 --> 30:04.972
but you don't have to keep up
with this charade.

30:05.105 --> 30:08.942
You're pushing me away because
that's what you do, but...

30:09.076 --> 30:12.479
Look, I'm asking you
not to this time. Okay?

30:20.789 --> 30:21.989
Will you marry me?

30:25.527 --> 30:26.393
Yes.

30:26.528 --> 30:27.961
Yes.

30:31.332 --> 30:33.668
Bravo!

30:35.869 --> 30:38.405
Champagne, please!
Champagne. Baby?

30:46.180 --> 30:48.349
But this is just a fantasy.

30:48.482 --> 30:50.518
That I want
for the rest of my life.

30:52.687 --> 30:54.355
Me too.

30:59.794 --> 31:02.564
You will not believe what
they have in my exact size.

31:02.697 --> 31:05.065
Oh, baby.

31:06.300 --> 31:07.736
No way!

31:07.868 --> 31:09.637
- Bling-bling!
- Bling!

31:09.771 --> 31:12.172
- Ah, I was late. Do it again.
- Okay.

31:12.306 --> 31:13.675
Bling-bling!

31:13.808 --> 31:16.176
Buddy, this place puts
<i>MTV's Cribs</i> to shame.

31:16.310 --> 31:18.379
This is the reboot.

31:20.515 --> 31:21.683
- Dude.
- What?

31:21.816 --> 31:24.552
- Is that a secret room?
- Oh!

31:24.686 --> 31:27.522
I bet that's where they keep
all the good shit. Heh.

31:29.356 --> 31:30.592
Panic room!

31:30.725 --> 31:32.727
Oh, I feel
just like Jodie Foster

31:32.861 --> 31:34.094
in that Jodie Foster movie.

31:35.896 --> 31:38.767
- Oh! My God!
- This is so dope!

31:38.899 --> 31:41.034
Oh, check it out.
Map of the whole house. Huh.

31:41.168 --> 31:42.771
Do all rich people
have panic rooms?

31:42.903 --> 31:45.406
Yeah, man. Gotta spend
that Bitcoin on something.

31:45.540 --> 31:47.709
Like garages
next to their armories?

31:49.343 --> 31:51.912
Oh, yippee-ki-yes, please.

31:52.045 --> 31:54.549
- Ha, ha! Yes!
- Oh, my God!

31:55.850 --> 31:58.385
Shall we call it "Alejandro"?

31:58.520 --> 32:00.120
Oh, he's actually a pacifist.

32:00.254 --> 32:02.122
Ohh, you're talking
about his dick.

32:02.256 --> 32:04.592
- Yeah. God.
- Yeah, that tracks.

32:04.726 --> 32:07.361
Oh, my God. Look at
all these cameras, dude.

32:07.494 --> 32:10.030
Oh, boy, hope they don't
have cameras in the bathroom.

32:10.164 --> 32:12.801
- I did gross stuff in there.
- We got a lot of bodyguards.

32:12.933 --> 32:15.269
Yeah, dude. Ballers gotta
have security, right?

32:15.402 --> 32:18.706
They gotta have grenades too?

32:18.840 --> 32:19.774
I got an idea.

32:24.746 --> 32:26.748
- Whoa! Little bro buddy! Hey.
- Huh?

32:26.881 --> 32:28.650
Haven't you ever seen
<i>Band of Brothers?</i>

32:28.783 --> 32:30.484
I let go of this handle,
we go boom.

32:30.618 --> 32:33.454
- Make it go boom.
- Let's do it.

32:42.897 --> 32:44.766
Keep moving.

32:44.899 --> 32:47.367
Hey, think you could loosen
these up a little bit?

32:47.502 --> 32:49.537
My fantasy didn't
really involve bondage.

32:49.671 --> 32:51.706
I don't know what
you're yapping about, but...

32:51.840 --> 32:54.141
- I'll take a look.
- Leave him alone, Himoff.

32:54.274 --> 32:56.376
Let's go. Come on.

32:56.511 --> 32:58.947
All right. So, what are
you guys up to, huh?

32:59.079 --> 33:01.448
- What is this mission?
- U.S. hostages are being held

33:01.583 --> 33:04.351
just over the border. We're
slipping in to pull them out.

33:04.485 --> 33:05.620
Any more classified intel

33:05.753 --> 33:07.287
you wanna share
with the prisoner?

33:07.421 --> 33:10.758
- Come on, sarge, he's American.
- Yeah, maybe.

33:10.892 --> 33:13.093
But he's no soldier.

33:18.766 --> 33:20.367
LT!

33:23.605 --> 33:25.205
You should talk to this guy.

33:25.339 --> 33:27.140
Claims he's one of us.

33:28.475 --> 33:29.711
Where'd you find him?

33:29.844 --> 33:32.412
Recon past the south ridge.

33:32.547 --> 33:35.182
Thought we were
the only game in town, huh?

33:36.651 --> 33:38.185
We are.

33:39.353 --> 33:41.756
You got a name?

33:41.890 --> 33:43.390
- What are you doing, Roarke?!
- Hey.

33:45.158 --> 33:47.595
- Keep your voice down.
- Yeah, cut the act. Get Roarke.

33:47.729 --> 33:51.231
- This isn't what I asked for.
- Got 10 seconds to ID yourself.

33:51.365 --> 33:53.601
They did a good job, you look
like him. But know what?

33:53.735 --> 33:55.235
He was a lot taller than you.

33:55.369 --> 33:57.739
- Five seconds.
- Yeah, I'll get Roarke myself.

33:57.872 --> 33:59.674
- Enough bullshit.
- Get your hands off me.

33:59.807 --> 34:01.408
Hey, don't touch that.

34:04.111 --> 34:06.814
Why is my name on your dog tags?

34:08.447 --> 34:10.083
- Contact!
- Cover fire!

34:10.217 --> 34:12.418
- To the right!
- Cover fire! Cover fire!

34:22.195 --> 34:23.362
Get down!

34:38.178 --> 34:40.882
Um, hello?

34:43.449 --> 34:44.985
Please, I need help.

34:49.591 --> 34:51.826
Did you just send someone?

35:01.603 --> 35:04.104
Roarke, if you can hear me,
I know what I said.

35:04.237 --> 35:06.440
I wanted to humiliate Sloane
and watch her cry,

35:06.574 --> 35:08.108
but this is not what I meant!

35:13.548 --> 35:16.651
Stop! Stop! Call it off!

35:35.803 --> 35:37.105
Dr. Torture?

35:41.341 --> 35:43.210
No. No, wait!

35:45.780 --> 35:47.649
Come on, come on.

35:53.153 --> 35:54.889
- Aah!
- No, stop!

36:01.495 --> 36:03.031
Shit. Uh...

36:04.799 --> 36:06.701
Intercom.

36:06.834 --> 36:07.935
Uh...

36:08.069 --> 36:09.269
<i>Sorry. Um...</i>

36:09.403 --> 36:10.672
<i>please continue.</i>

36:11.973 --> 36:13.007
Uh...

36:17.512 --> 36:20.380
Okay, so I want you
to cut off her ring finger

36:20.515 --> 36:22.050
<i>on her...</i>

36:22.182 --> 36:23.718
<i>On her left hand.</i>

36:25.086 --> 36:27.822
- Unh!
- No! No, her right hand.

36:27.955 --> 36:29.322
<i>Right hand.</i>

36:29.456 --> 36:31.526
This is my fantasy. Just do it.

36:52.814 --> 36:53.848
Easy.

37:14.902 --> 37:16.771
Meredith?

37:16.904 --> 37:19.874
- Melanie.
- What are you doing here?

37:20.007 --> 37:22.409
Same as you.
I was kidnapped. Come on.

37:22.543 --> 37:24.078
Go, go, go.

37:26.914 --> 37:29.249
- Thank you. You saved my life.
- It's not saved yet.

37:34.354 --> 37:36.256
To the best weekend
of our lives!

37:36.389 --> 37:38.258
Screw the glow,
I'll drink to that.

37:40.928 --> 37:42.930
- Mm.
- Oh, yeah.

37:44.431 --> 37:45.666
Were those gunshots?

37:45.800 --> 37:48.468
Ooh, maybe somebody broke
into the armory.

37:48.603 --> 37:49.737
Hey, a laser pointer.

37:53.775 --> 37:55.843
Come on, models.
Come on.

37:57.145 --> 37:58.946
- Oh!
- Don't panic, don't panic.

37:59.080 --> 38:00.948
- Panic room!
- Yes! Go, go!

38:01.082 --> 38:03.184
- What panic room?
- Come on, models!

38:03.316 --> 38:05.119
I can't run in these shoes!

38:05.253 --> 38:07.922
- Guys, come on. It's up here!
- Go, go, go!

38:08.055 --> 38:09.991
- Oh, my God.
- Guys, come on!

38:10.124 --> 38:12.593
- Come here. It's right here.
- I'm gonna call Roarke.

38:18.633 --> 38:20.902
Are you and your brother
enjoying your fantasy?

38:21.035 --> 38:23.004
We loved it
until guys with guns showed up.

38:23.137 --> 38:24.939
Come on, you guys.
Let's go. Seriously.

38:25.072 --> 38:27.108
Ah, yes.
Sounds like Kalashov's men.

38:27.241 --> 38:29.010
- Who the hell is Kalashov?
- <i>A businessman</i>

38:29.143 --> 38:31.646
- <i>who formerly owned the house.</i>
- What kind of business?

38:37.718 --> 38:39.821
<i>I'm afraid the problem
with having it all</i>

38:39.954 --> 38:42.023
is usually other people
want to take it.

38:42.156 --> 38:43.958
We don't really
wanna have it all, okay?

38:44.091 --> 38:45.693
We wanna borrow it
for the weekend.

38:45.827 --> 38:48.162
Get off the phone.
We gotta get in the panic room.

38:48.296 --> 38:49.530
- Come on! What?
- Door!

38:49.664 --> 38:52.066
No! Chas, hey!

38:52.200 --> 38:54.135
It's us. Hello?

38:54.268 --> 38:57.238
- Kind of being a Chas-hole.
- Seriously, I'm such a weenie.

38:57.370 --> 38:58.706
I don't even do escape rooms.

38:58.840 --> 39:00.975
As I have told you,
once a fantasy begins,

39:01.108 --> 39:03.744
you must see it through
to its natural conclusion.

39:03.878 --> 39:06.013
Nobody knew
what you meant by that!

39:06.147 --> 39:08.149
Have a good night.

39:09.482 --> 39:11.719
He hung up.

39:21.662 --> 39:23.831
Okay, we... You know what?
We gotta calm down.

39:23.965 --> 39:25.299
- Okay.
- Gotta calm down.

39:25.432 --> 39:26.499
This is all fake, right?

39:28.870 --> 39:30.805
- Ooh!
- Alejandro's a hell of an actor.

39:30.938 --> 39:32.006
Oh, so, what do we do?

39:33.541 --> 39:34.675
We surrender!

39:34.809 --> 39:37.144
I'm still trying
to process this.

39:37.278 --> 39:41.949
You and I were kidnapped
by the same person?

39:42.083 --> 39:45.753
- I know. It's crazy, right?
- How did you escape?

39:45.887 --> 39:48.022
Headbutt.

39:48.155 --> 39:49.790
I... I headbutted the guard.

39:49.924 --> 39:52.293
I stole his gun
and just capped him.

39:52.425 --> 39:54.128
- Wow.
- Yeah.

39:55.096 --> 39:56.631
What happened to the gun?

39:56.764 --> 39:57.732
I lost it.

39:59.499 --> 40:01.869
What kind of twisted,
disgusting freak

40:02.003 --> 40:04.038
would wanna ruin my life
and make me watch?

40:04.171 --> 40:05.907
It's obviously someone
we both know.

40:06.040 --> 40:08.309
Someone we went
to high school with.

40:08.441 --> 40:10.144
What about
that psycho stalker girl?

40:10.278 --> 40:12.580
You know the one
that wrote letters to everyone?

40:12.713 --> 40:14.282
Totally.

40:14.414 --> 40:16.350
That's a really good call.

40:16.483 --> 40:18.451
What was her name again?

40:18.586 --> 40:21.589
- Mm, Meredith?
- Oh, my God.

40:21.722 --> 40:24.959
- What?
- Did they make you wear that?

40:25.092 --> 40:26.294
I am so sorry.

40:26.426 --> 40:28.562
Look, I don't know
how we both ended up here,

40:28.696 --> 40:30.698
but you got us out
of that hellhole.

40:30.831 --> 40:33.367
- No biggie.
- Now I'm gonna get us home.

40:33.501 --> 40:34.936
They brought me here in a boat.

40:35.069 --> 40:38.572
Find the shore,
we find a way out of here.

41:00.061 --> 41:02.430
Unless your fantasy is to die,

41:02.563 --> 41:04.699
you better come with me.

41:06.767 --> 41:09.303
We should probably go with him.

41:09.437 --> 41:11.005
Yeah.

41:40.101 --> 41:41.635
What's wrong?

41:41.769 --> 41:43.604
Is something wrong?

41:44.939 --> 41:46.907
No, no.

41:49.477 --> 41:51.178
Nothing's wrong.

41:55.182 --> 41:57.351
Everything's perfect.

42:05.526 --> 42:07.395
Hello?

42:23.110 --> 42:24.812
Anybody there?

42:36.057 --> 42:38.492
Whoa! Ha, ha!

42:38.626 --> 42:41.530
- Dazed and confused.
- Huh?

42:41.662 --> 42:43.864
You know, like that movie
came out last year.

42:43.998 --> 42:46.200
"That's what I love
about high school girls."

42:46.333 --> 42:48.035
Shut up, Himoff.
No more flashes.

42:50.104 --> 42:52.473
Whoa, hey, hey.
No, no, no. I can explain.

42:52.606 --> 42:54.909
Yeah. You better.
Have a little chat, you and me.

42:55.042 --> 42:56.610
Let's go. On your feet.

42:56.744 --> 42:58.379
Walk.

42:59.680 --> 43:02.316
Your tags have my name on them.

43:05.619 --> 43:07.088
Then I find this
in your wallet.

43:07.221 --> 43:09.890
- Hey, hey. Be careful with that.
- Ah-ah-ah.

43:11.725 --> 43:13.761
Why do you have
a picture of me and my son?

43:13.894 --> 43:16.063
Look, you gotta be
straight with me.

43:16.197 --> 43:18.732
- Are you an actor?
- Am I an actor? I'm a soldier.

43:18.866 --> 43:21.969
Time for you to be straight
with me. Where did you get this?

43:24.405 --> 43:26.907
- That's me when I was 9.
- Nah, don't.

43:28.342 --> 43:30.478
- That's my son.
- And he's got a nickname.

43:30.611 --> 43:32.146
What is it?

43:32.279 --> 43:34.148
Why don't you tell me.

43:35.550 --> 43:37.051
Patch.

43:38.853 --> 43:40.121
Wrong.

43:41.222 --> 43:42.490
Ali.

43:43.724 --> 43:45.960
Then I find your ID.

43:46.093 --> 43:48.329
Your face with my son's name
and birthday on it.

43:48.462 --> 43:50.164
Enough games.
Time for you to tell me

43:50.297 --> 43:53.267
what the hell's going on here.

43:53.400 --> 43:56.103
I was born
four months premature.

43:56.237 --> 43:58.706
The doctor said
I wouldn't make it, but I did.

43:58.839 --> 44:01.142
You said I wasn't the type
to throw in the towel.

44:01.275 --> 44:03.644
That I was a fighter.

44:03.777 --> 44:05.146
Like Muhammad Ali.

44:07.582 --> 44:11.452
- Who told you that story?
- You did. Every birthday.

44:11.586 --> 44:13.522
You're saying you're my son?

44:14.788 --> 44:16.190
Mm-mm.

44:16.323 --> 44:20.127
- That's impossible.
- Yeah, I thought so too.

44:20.261 --> 44:22.763
Uh, now I'm not so sure.

44:22.897 --> 44:24.999
When was the last time
you saw him?

44:25.132 --> 44:26.700
Nine months...

44:28.068 --> 44:30.137
seven days ago.

44:30.271 --> 44:32.339
It was raining.

44:32.473 --> 44:34.543
He refused his mama's umbrella.

44:34.675 --> 44:37.512
You know, he wanted
to show me he was tough.

44:37.646 --> 44:40.047
That's not why I did it.

44:40.181 --> 44:42.816
It's so that you couldn't tell
I was crying.

44:48.155 --> 44:49.658
How is this happening?

44:49.823 --> 44:53.194
There's this place,
this island.

44:53.327 --> 44:55.162
It can make
whatever you want come true.

44:55.296 --> 44:56.764
I said I wanted to be a soldier.

44:56.897 --> 44:58.699
What I really wanted
was to see you again.

44:58.832 --> 45:01.670
Somehow the island knew.

45:01.802 --> 45:03.672
When's the last time
you saw me?

45:03.804 --> 45:07.041
Twenty-seven years,
six months, five days.

45:08.742 --> 45:11.779
- So I never made it home?
- You died saving your men

45:11.912 --> 45:14.882
on a classified mission
in Venezuela.

45:15.015 --> 45:16.717
Venezuela, you sure?

45:16.850 --> 45:19.086
Yeah, of course. Why?

45:20.221 --> 45:22.089
Because we'll be there tomorrow.

45:57.891 --> 46:01.395
- Gather up the crew...
- Mr. Roarke.

46:01.529 --> 46:05.165
- Ms. Olsen, good morning.
- It's a really good photoshop.

46:05.299 --> 46:07.468
I don't know
how you got it on my phone

46:07.602 --> 46:09.837
but it does look real.

46:09.970 --> 46:12.741
Ah, it is real. You said yes
to Allen, so you're married.

46:12.873 --> 46:16.076
- Looks like a lovely ceremony.
- He just proposed last night.

46:16.210 --> 46:17.778
Are you sure?

46:22.116 --> 46:24.118
There's something
different about him.

46:24.251 --> 46:28.389
- He looks older.
- You've been married five years.

46:30.725 --> 46:31.892
I don't understand.

46:34.629 --> 46:36.598
Daddy, look what I found.

46:36.731 --> 46:38.999
- Oh, my gosh...
- Her name is Lila.

46:40.568 --> 46:41.835
She's my...?

46:41.969 --> 46:44.405
Daughter.

46:44.539 --> 46:47.007
This is the life
you've always wanted, no?

46:47.141 --> 46:49.611
What do you think, yes?

46:51.412 --> 46:53.515
Okay, enough. She's a...
She's a child.

46:53.648 --> 46:55.482
And you are her mother.

46:55.617 --> 46:57.519
See for yourself.

47:04.425 --> 47:05.492
<i>Baby girl.</i>

47:12.466 --> 47:14.068
<i>Sleep tight, honey.</i>

47:17.271 --> 47:18.540
- Ah...
- Ah...

47:21.810 --> 47:23.410
How is this possible?

47:23.545 --> 47:25.479
It's the island.

47:25.613 --> 47:27.981
The island has,
uh, great powers.

47:28.115 --> 47:32.319
I first heard of its legend
many, many years ago.

47:32.453 --> 47:36.390
A place where anything
is possible. I was obsessed.

47:36.524 --> 47:39.561
I convinced my wife
to help me find it.

47:39.694 --> 47:42.831
Our journey was long
and hard, and...

47:45.767 --> 47:48.703
She died before we, uh...
Before we arrived.

47:50.170 --> 47:51.872
When I finally discovered
this place,

47:52.005 --> 47:55.543
I wished for her to live again.

47:55.677 --> 47:59.179
To return just as I met her.
Forever.

48:00.715 --> 48:02.950
It brought her back to...?

48:03.083 --> 48:06.387
- To life?
- Yes.

48:06.521 --> 48:10.924
As long as I stay here and I
orchestrate all the fantasies...

48:11.058 --> 48:12.727
she lives.

48:12.861 --> 48:15.597
The island
has granted your wish too.

48:15.730 --> 48:19.868
To have the family
you've always wanted.

48:20.000 --> 48:23.605
- A life you always dreamt of.
- More sand on the side.

48:23.738 --> 48:26.440
- That's perfect.
- I suggest you start living it.

48:28.075 --> 48:29.711
Mommy, come play!

48:39.253 --> 48:41.054
Wrap it up, sergeant.

48:42.757 --> 48:45.025
Hey, walk with me.

48:45.159 --> 48:46.927
Grab your ruck.

48:49.764 --> 48:50.799
Hey, LT, over here.

48:53.200 --> 48:54.736
The hell are you doing, Himoff?

48:54.869 --> 48:56.970
You two look so alike,
you could be related.

48:57.104 --> 48:59.741
- I just thought that...
- Don't do that. Don't think.

48:59.874 --> 49:01.108
Do your job.

49:06.548 --> 49:08.583
I don't know
how this is happening,

49:08.716 --> 49:10.752
but I believe you,
so we're leaving.

49:10.885 --> 49:13.755
It's a straight shot to Panama.
I can get us home from there.

49:13.888 --> 49:16.390
Wait. You're calling off
the mission?

49:16.524 --> 49:18.526
No. I'm getting us out of here.

49:18.660 --> 49:21.830
Well, you can't do that.
You're a hero.

49:21.962 --> 49:23.997
You know what a hero is?

49:24.131 --> 49:26.668
A hero's some guy
who's too stupid to stay alive.

49:26.801 --> 49:29.336
No, no, no. This isn't
what's supposed to happen.

49:29.470 --> 49:32.272
So then what's supposed
to happen?

49:32.406 --> 49:33.875
I'm supposed to die?

49:35.142 --> 49:37.277
- Let's go.
- Look, if you do this,

49:37.411 --> 49:40.515
if you run, I don't know
what will happen to you, to me,

49:40.648 --> 49:42.684
but I know those men
back there, your men,

49:42.817 --> 49:45.285
they'll die because
you won't be there to save them.

49:45.419 --> 49:49.524
- You don't know that.
- I do! It's why I have your tags.

49:49.657 --> 49:53.628
There was a grenade. You threw
yourself on it to save your men.

49:53.761 --> 49:55.362
You were a hero.

49:55.496 --> 49:57.498
You were my hero.

49:58.900 --> 50:00.267
Look...

50:02.469 --> 50:04.471
you may have grown up
without a father,

50:04.606 --> 50:06.674
but I'm going home to my son.

50:08.342 --> 50:10.177
This is a mistake,
and it is one

50:10.310 --> 50:12.145
you'll regret
for the rest of your life.

50:12.279 --> 50:15.650
Somebody died and I could've
stopped it, so trust me...

50:15.783 --> 50:17.084
I know.

50:19.152 --> 50:20.989
At least I'll still be alive.

50:45.613 --> 50:47.481
You can't be a coward.

50:47.615 --> 50:48.816
I won't let you.

50:48.950 --> 50:50.919
What choice do I have?

50:51.051 --> 50:54.488
We complete the mission.
We save your men.

50:54.622 --> 50:56.691
But you said
that I die in Venezuela.

50:56.824 --> 50:58.091
You did.

50:59.794 --> 51:01.529
But I'm here now.

51:05.033 --> 51:08.435
So, what you're saying is,
you're guests?

51:08.570 --> 51:10.103
- Yes.
- Ah.

51:10.237 --> 51:13.741
And you've never heard
of Kalashov.

51:13.875 --> 51:14.776
- No.
- Yes.

51:14.909 --> 51:15.910
Uh, what he said.

51:16.044 --> 51:19.581
And we are just actors

51:19.714 --> 51:20.915
on Fantasy Island.

51:23.183 --> 51:25.085
- Yes. Heh.
- Yeah.

51:25.218 --> 51:27.622
- Oh, whoa! Hey, hey, hey!
- Oh, God. Oh!

51:29.289 --> 51:30.625
You okay?

51:38.198 --> 51:41.401
Okay. One of you is going
to tell me the truth.

51:41.536 --> 51:43.071
Or did you little punks think

51:43.203 --> 51:45.940
you could just kill Kalashov
and take over?

51:46.074 --> 51:48.743
We have no idea who Kalashov is.

51:48.876 --> 51:50.745
I thought you were talking
about a vodka.

51:50.878 --> 51:54.281
- We didn't kill anyone.
- No, but your bodyguards did.

51:54.414 --> 51:56.751
But that's okay
because we just killed them.

51:56.884 --> 51:58.653
And before I kill you two,

51:58.786 --> 52:03.190
you will tell me what you did
with cash and cocaine.

52:03.323 --> 52:05.225
- Cash?
- Cocaine?

52:05.359 --> 52:08.328
- No, we... We did some cocaine.
- Oh, boy. Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

52:08.462 --> 52:10.263
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- Oh, shit.

52:11.566 --> 52:13.300
You keep playing dumb

52:13.433 --> 52:15.937
and I will show you
what good actor I am.

52:16.070 --> 52:18.606
No, I think there's been
a misunderstanding.

52:18.740 --> 52:21.109
We talked to Roarke,
and we said we are done.

52:21.241 --> 52:23.310
So this is between you and him.

52:23.443 --> 52:25.379
- Hey. Hey, don't do that!
- Whoa! No! Whoa!

52:25.513 --> 52:27.982
- Hey, I swear, we have no idea...
- Okay.

52:28.116 --> 52:30.118
...where the drugs
or cash are, okay?

52:30.250 --> 52:31.819
Are you sure?

52:31.953 --> 52:33.721
Because you're about
to lose your hand.

52:33.855 --> 52:37.825
We don't know. Please!
If we did, we'd tell you!

52:37.959 --> 52:39.560
- This was supposed to be fun.
- Yeah.

52:39.694 --> 52:43.598
- A fantasy!
- Maybe this isn't your fantasy.

52:43.731 --> 52:47.835
- Maybe it's mine.
- Well, that is so messed up, man.

52:47.969 --> 52:50.004
- Aah! Oh!
- Oh, my God!

52:51.806 --> 52:54.542
Okay, okay!
We know where the money is!

52:54.676 --> 52:56.511
Well, tell me.

52:57.912 --> 52:59.179
Tell me!

52:59.312 --> 53:01.481
It's... It's downstairs.

53:02.517 --> 53:04.351
Near the garage.

53:04.484 --> 53:05.485
Yes!

53:06.587 --> 53:08.656
- Okay.
- God!

53:08.790 --> 53:10.390
You stay with Goldilocks.

53:10.525 --> 53:11.726
You, come with me.

53:24.237 --> 53:27.407
- This castle's gonna be my house.
- Oh, God.

53:27.542 --> 53:30.444
What? Just your house?

53:30.578 --> 53:31.779
You're moving out already?

53:31.913 --> 53:33.881
Can I come in here
and live with you?

53:34.015 --> 53:35.717
- No.
- Why not?

53:35.850 --> 53:37.518
You know why, Mommy.

53:40.220 --> 53:42.957
I need shells for my house.

53:45.159 --> 53:46.728
If it makes you feel better,

53:46.861 --> 53:50.031
I'm not allowed
to live there either.

53:50.164 --> 53:52.934
This is everything
I've ever wanted.

53:55.737 --> 53:57.939
I wish I felt like
I deserved it.

54:00.208 --> 54:02.176
You do deserve it.

54:15.523 --> 54:18.593
I love you both so much.

54:40.148 --> 54:41.849
Hey, where you going?

54:43.718 --> 54:45.686
To make things right.

55:00.902 --> 55:03.571
Mr. Roarke, can I talk to you?

55:08.142 --> 55:10.511
- I want a new fantasy.
- I thought I was very clear.

55:10.645 --> 55:13.346
- One fantasy per guest.
- Yes, I understand what you said.

55:13.480 --> 55:15.482
- But I'm...
- No, no, no. Trust me, trust me.

55:15.616 --> 55:18.686
People would kill
to have what you have, a family.

55:18.820 --> 55:21.656
Please, enjoy them
while you can.

55:21.789 --> 55:24.391
You don't understand.
Mr. Roarke.

55:40.942 --> 55:42.475
Should we trust him?

55:42.610 --> 55:45.313
He's almost as scary-looking
as the last guy.

55:45.445 --> 55:47.181
Why would someone pretend
to save us?

55:47.315 --> 55:49.550
Hey! You.

55:49.684 --> 55:51.285
- Damon.
- Damon.

55:51.418 --> 55:52.820
We've been walking all night.

55:52.954 --> 55:54.655
Tell us what's up
before we go one more step.

55:54.789 --> 55:58.192
We're exposed out here. Roarke's
got eyes and ears everywhere.

55:58.326 --> 55:59.459
Who's Roarke?

55:59.594 --> 56:00.695
Ask her.

56:03.463 --> 56:05.233
I have no idea
what he's talking about.

56:05.365 --> 56:07.235
We should keep moving. Come on.

56:13.808 --> 56:16.043
All right, move it or lose it.

56:16.177 --> 56:18.212
We can gab down here.

56:20.882 --> 56:22.583
Down where? Where are we going?

56:22.717 --> 56:24.886
You want off this island or not?

56:26.921 --> 56:28.455
Stay close.

56:28.589 --> 56:31.424
You do not wanna get separated.

56:35.663 --> 56:37.298
Gross.

56:39.100 --> 56:41.369
This way. Oh, no. Wait.

56:41.502 --> 56:44.238
Maybe, uh... Maybe this way.
Uh, no.

56:44.372 --> 56:46.807
Maybe... Maybe this...

56:46.941 --> 56:47.909
No.

56:48.042 --> 56:49.877
This way, this way.

57:29.449 --> 57:31.185
Come on, blondie.

57:36.590 --> 57:38.458
Are you kidding me with this?

57:38.592 --> 57:40.528
Floods during high tide.

57:40.661 --> 57:43.764
Ain't the water
you should be afraid of.

57:45.099 --> 57:47.134
- Oh.
- Great.

57:53.374 --> 57:55.009
Let's go. Let's go.

57:56.644 --> 57:58.980
- What the hell was that?
- What the hell was what?

57:59.113 --> 58:01.749
Sea snakes.
They're attracted to movement.

58:01.882 --> 58:03.951
Just don't, you know,
freak out.

58:04.085 --> 58:06.954
Wade through dirty water
in a dark cave

58:07.088 --> 58:10.558
filled with sea snakes
without freaking out.

58:10.691 --> 58:12.760
Super easy.

58:15.830 --> 58:17.164
What's wrong?

58:20.167 --> 58:22.269
I... I...

58:22.403 --> 58:24.972
Nothing. Nothing.
Never mind.

58:26.774 --> 58:28.642
It's just up here.

58:44.225 --> 58:46.160
I forgive you.

58:50.731 --> 58:52.066
What am I looking at?

58:52.199 --> 58:53.401
Your deepest desire.

58:53.534 --> 58:54.568
This is why I brought you here,

58:54.702 --> 58:57.304
so you can see for yourselves.

58:57.438 --> 59:01.409
Your fantasy would be to get
back together with your husband?

59:01.542 --> 59:02.977
What the hell is this place?

59:03.110 --> 59:04.845
That's what I was hired
to find out.

59:04.979 --> 59:07.415
I'm a PI. Client offered me
a big old payday

59:07.548 --> 59:09.650
to figure out
what happens here and how.

59:09.784 --> 59:11.752
Wants the power of the island
for himself.

59:11.886 --> 59:14.155
I booked a stay
three weeks back.

59:14.288 --> 59:17.625
Was skeptical at first,
but then my fantasy started.

59:17.758 --> 59:20.094
I saw my daughter,
who I'd lost years ago.

59:20.227 --> 59:21.662
It was beautiful.

59:21.796 --> 59:24.932
But then it got all twisted,
became a nightmare.

59:25.066 --> 59:27.401
Roarke found my sat phone
and destroyed it

59:27.536 --> 59:29.103
before I was able
to call for help.

59:29.236 --> 59:31.605
He knew... everything.

59:31.739 --> 59:36.477
This place is evil.
Roarke is evil. Huh?

59:36.610 --> 59:39.046
Doesn't care who lives or dies.

59:39.180 --> 59:41.048
But I know how to stop him.

59:41.182 --> 59:43.717
Oh, yeah, I do.

59:43.851 --> 59:46.220
Island's power comes
from this here rock thing.

59:46.353 --> 59:49.390
Turns the water black,
dripping everywhere.

59:49.524 --> 59:52.293
It can do impossible things.

59:52.426 --> 59:54.628
Bring a loved one back to life,

59:54.762 --> 59:59.266
turn them into a black-eyed
zombie, like it did my daughter.

59:59.400 --> 01:00:02.236
I'm not sure how Roarke does it.

01:00:02.369 --> 01:00:05.706
But he uses the water
to grant fantasies.

01:00:05.840 --> 01:00:08.943
I'm gonna use it
to expose him as a monster.

01:00:09.076 --> 01:00:12.413
Which is why I need you
to smuggle this off the island.

01:00:12.547 --> 01:00:14.982
I know a private pilot,
hour away.

01:00:15.116 --> 01:00:17.485
Find a phone in the hotel,
call him at this number,

01:00:17.618 --> 01:00:19.320
get off this island
with the canteen.

01:00:19.453 --> 01:00:21.655
- Tell the world about this place.
- What about you?

01:00:21.789 --> 01:00:23.390
Roarke won't let me
near the hotel.

01:00:23.525 --> 01:00:26.393
But as far as he's concerned,
you're just a guest.

01:00:26.528 --> 01:00:28.563
- A guest?
- What?

01:00:30.431 --> 01:00:32.501
No, I'm not.

01:00:32.633 --> 01:00:35.302
Yeah. I saw you
get off the plane.

01:00:35.436 --> 01:00:37.171
You got here on a plane?

01:00:37.304 --> 01:00:38.272
No.

01:00:38.405 --> 01:00:40.007
What?

01:00:40.141 --> 01:00:42.109
He is crazy.

01:00:42.243 --> 01:00:44.145
I saved you, remember?

01:00:55.189 --> 01:00:57.291
Your fantasy
was to ruin my life?

01:00:57.424 --> 01:00:59.628
And who are all those people?

01:01:00.895 --> 01:01:03.130
Oh, my God.

01:01:03.264 --> 01:01:05.866
You're the psycho stalker girl.

01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:09.136
You did all of this
because of a couple of pranks?

01:01:09.270 --> 01:01:11.305
Pranks?

01:01:11.438 --> 01:01:14.708
You tortured me
every single day for years.

01:01:14.842 --> 01:01:16.477
Oh, please.
I teased you a little.

01:01:16.611 --> 01:01:18.613
I was so traumatized
by what you did,

01:01:18.746 --> 01:01:20.515
I had to finish high school
from home.

01:01:20.649 --> 01:01:22.517
Yes, trying to ruin your life
was wrong,

01:01:22.651 --> 01:01:24.985
but you ruined mine first.
Which way to the hotel?

01:01:25.119 --> 01:01:26.854
I'm ready to get off
this island.

01:01:26.987 --> 01:01:28.657
I'll show you. Come on.

01:01:40.701 --> 01:01:42.069
Julia?

01:01:42.203 --> 01:01:44.506
Julia, are you okay?

01:01:44.639 --> 01:01:45.906
I'm fine.

01:01:46.040 --> 01:01:48.909
- Have some water.
- I'm fine. No, please, I'm okay.

01:01:54.649 --> 01:01:58.118
It's beautiful out there.
Please go enjoy your fantasy.

01:01:58.252 --> 01:01:59.453
I can't.

01:01:59.588 --> 01:02:01.556
I want a new one.

01:02:04.758 --> 01:02:08.896
- You'd have to ask Mr. Roarke.
- I tried. He won't listen.

01:02:09.029 --> 01:02:11.232
I want to change
the moment that I regret most,

01:02:11.365 --> 01:02:12.733
but I chose the wrong one.

01:02:12.866 --> 01:02:15.069
I didn't think any of this
was gonna be real,

01:02:15.202 --> 01:02:16.937
and now I have
five years of memories

01:02:17.071 --> 01:02:19.173
of a daughter
that I didn't have yesterday.

01:02:19.306 --> 01:02:21.909
For a new fantasy, you'd be
willing to give it all up?

01:02:22.042 --> 01:02:24.078
Your own child?

01:02:26.180 --> 01:02:28.882
Six years ago,
there was an accident.

01:02:29.016 --> 01:02:31.118
A fire in my apartment.

01:02:31.252 --> 01:02:33.722
It's why I told Mr. Roarke
I was in a dark place.

01:02:33.854 --> 01:02:35.590
Someone died,

01:02:35.724 --> 01:02:38.859
and it was my fault.

01:02:38.993 --> 01:02:41.829
If I can stop that
from happening and I don't,

01:02:41.962 --> 01:02:43.897
I can never live
with myself, Julia.

01:02:44.031 --> 01:02:46.900
I am begging you.

01:02:47.034 --> 01:02:49.236
Please, help me.

01:02:55.075 --> 01:02:58.145
If your fantasy is to change
the moment you regret the most,

01:02:58.279 --> 01:03:00.649
you don't want a new fantasy.

01:03:05.386 --> 01:03:08.055
- I want my fantasy.
- Ms. Olsen, you have to stop.

01:03:08.188 --> 01:03:10.457
I'm not asking for a new one.

01:03:10.592 --> 01:03:13.260
I'm asking for
the same fantasy done right.

01:03:13.394 --> 01:03:15.129
If I'd known
when I got off that plane

01:03:15.262 --> 01:03:16.598
that I could change the past,

01:03:16.731 --> 01:03:18.733
there is no question
what I would have chosen.

01:03:18.866 --> 01:03:21.235
I am sorry that you only now
believe in the island,

01:03:21.368 --> 01:03:23.505
but rules exist for a reason.

01:03:23.638 --> 01:03:26.073
Oh, but those aren't
the only rules. Are they?

01:03:26.206 --> 01:03:27.808
You have one of your own.

01:03:27.941 --> 01:03:30.311
As long as you do the island's
bidding, your wife lives.

01:03:30.444 --> 01:03:31.746
That's what you told me.

01:03:31.879 --> 01:03:34.281
- I've given you a fantasy.
- You misled me.

01:03:34.415 --> 01:03:36.651
My fantasy was
to have a do-over,

01:03:36.785 --> 01:03:38.653
but that's not the do-over
I wanted.

01:03:43.190 --> 01:03:45.560
You're willing
to risk your wife over it?

01:03:47.595 --> 01:03:51.198
Very well. Are you sure
this is what you want?

01:03:57.639 --> 01:03:59.840
It's not what I want.

01:03:59.973 --> 01:04:01.710
It's what I have to do.

01:04:53.927 --> 01:04:54.796
Whoa!

01:05:09.209 --> 01:05:10.845
Oh, no.

01:05:19.721 --> 01:05:21.790
- Nick!
- Help me! I'm trapped!

01:05:24.024 --> 01:05:26.528
- Come on, JD!
- Wait, Brax, JD?

01:05:26.661 --> 01:05:28.128
Lady, there's a fire. Come on.

01:05:28.262 --> 01:05:30.063
- Go!
- No, wait!

01:05:34.502 --> 01:05:37.572
- Stairway's to the right!
- Nick!

01:05:37.705 --> 01:05:39.808
Help! I'm trapped!

01:05:39.940 --> 01:05:41.910
- Don't let me die, please!
- Ow!

01:05:42.042 --> 01:05:45.078
- I can't breathe!
- Nick. Nick!

01:05:45.212 --> 01:05:47.314
I'm gonna go get help, okay?
Just hang on!

01:05:47.448 --> 01:05:49.651
Please don't go!
Please don't leave!

01:05:49.784 --> 01:05:53.253
- Officer? There's someone inside.
- Back up. Let's go!

01:05:53.387 --> 01:05:55.255
I need you to help
break his door down.

01:05:55.389 --> 01:05:56.290
Please calm down.

01:05:56.423 --> 01:05:59.293
- Help is on the way.
- Patrick?

01:05:59.426 --> 01:06:01.596
Sorry, do I know you?

01:06:01.729 --> 01:06:05.466
The fire is in my unit. It's my
upstairs neighbor, he's trapped.

01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:08.168
You need to come inside!
Help me kick his door in.

01:06:08.302 --> 01:06:10.672
The, uh... We should wait
for the fire department.

01:06:10.805 --> 01:06:12.807
- They'll be here any moment.
- They'll be too late!

01:06:12.941 --> 01:06:13.842
We have to save him!

01:06:13.974 --> 01:06:16.511
You have to help me save him!

01:06:20.715 --> 01:06:23.651
We should really wait
for the fire department. It...

01:06:26.888 --> 01:06:28.455
I'm going back in.

01:06:29.624 --> 01:06:30.692
You'll get hurt!

01:06:30.825 --> 01:06:32.961
Don't be a hero!

01:06:42.804 --> 01:06:45.507
Please help me! Please!

01:06:45.640 --> 01:06:47.842
I'm coming, Nick!

01:06:47.976 --> 01:06:50.645
Trying to find something
to break your door down with.

01:06:57.017 --> 01:06:58.920
I'm trapped in here.

01:06:59.988 --> 01:07:01.556
I can't breathe.

01:07:14.002 --> 01:07:15.904
It's just right over here.

01:07:26.981 --> 01:07:28.917
Oh, boy. Oh, boy.

01:07:29.049 --> 01:07:31.385
Your brother now is dead.

01:07:31.519 --> 01:07:34.187
You also are dead.

01:07:34.321 --> 01:07:37.525
There's nobody who can save
you two little shits.

01:07:37.659 --> 01:07:40.929
- Alejandro can.
- Who?

01:07:41.996 --> 01:07:43.765
- Who the...?
- Aah!

01:07:45.667 --> 01:07:46.601
Oh, boy.

01:07:46.734 --> 01:07:49.571
This ain't your fantasy,
asshole.

01:07:51.673 --> 01:07:53.240
Did you hear that?

01:07:53.373 --> 01:07:55.577
It sounded like gunfire.

01:07:55.710 --> 01:07:57.712
Wasn't asking you.

01:07:57.845 --> 01:08:00.247
Sounded like gunfire.

01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:03.283
You know, you can
just say sorry.

01:08:03.417 --> 01:08:06.988
- Yeah, that would be a start.
- He was talking to you.

01:08:07.120 --> 01:08:09.624
I was talking to you both.

01:08:09.757 --> 01:08:14.294
You, sounds like you were a real
Ms. Teen Asshole 2009 back then.

01:08:14.428 --> 01:08:17.765
Time to make amends for your
past and ask for forgiveness.

01:08:17.899 --> 01:08:19.131
And you.

01:08:19.265 --> 01:08:20.902
Grow up.

01:08:21.035 --> 01:08:22.804
Stop giving
this teenage version of her

01:08:22.937 --> 01:08:24.872
all this dang power
over your life.

01:08:25.006 --> 01:08:26.941
Revenge ain't gonna fix you.

01:08:27.075 --> 01:08:28.943
Only you can fix you.

01:08:29.077 --> 01:08:31.946
God, you two remind me
of my daughter.

01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:33.747
Never did right by her.

01:08:33.881 --> 01:08:36.783
I'm gonna get you both off this
island, one way or the other.

01:08:38.352 --> 01:08:39.453
Let's go.

01:08:44.091 --> 01:08:46.460
Go, go!

01:08:47.795 --> 01:08:49.697
Stop!

01:08:49.831 --> 01:08:51.298
Stop!

01:08:51.430 --> 01:08:53.501
- Please, no!
- Get out of here!

01:08:53.635 --> 01:08:55.435
No, no!

01:09:18.457 --> 01:09:20.426
- No!
- No!

01:09:26.768 --> 01:09:28.435
He saved us.

01:09:28.569 --> 01:09:31.139
So we could get off this island.

01:09:31.270 --> 01:09:34.042
Hold on.
I gotta get his map.

01:09:36.678 --> 01:09:38.779
Come on. Come on.

01:09:47.822 --> 01:09:50.223
All right, I want you
to hang back and watch our 6.

01:09:50.357 --> 01:09:52.225
- No, I'm coming with you.
- No.

01:09:52.359 --> 01:09:55.863
If things went sideways,
it's because we got ambushed.

01:09:55.997 --> 01:09:57.732
Make sure that doesn't happen.

01:10:03.470 --> 01:10:05.039
It's gonna take
more than a shotgun

01:10:05.173 --> 01:10:08.341
to save you
and your idiot brother!

01:10:11.344 --> 01:10:13.047
Something like this?

01:10:13.181 --> 01:10:14.782
I wouldn't do that.

01:10:14.916 --> 01:10:17.719
I let go of this handle,
we go boom.

01:10:17.852 --> 01:10:20.588
Put the pin back in.

01:10:20.722 --> 01:10:22.156
Okay, okay, okay. Okay.

01:10:22.289 --> 01:10:24.559
Guns on the ground. Now.

01:10:28.328 --> 01:10:31.065
My friend upstairs definitely
going to kill your brother.

01:10:31.199 --> 01:10:34.267
- Then he'll kill you for sure.
- Not if he doesn't know it's me.

01:10:39.207 --> 01:10:42.110
You two go first,
with me right behind you.

01:10:42.242 --> 01:10:43.611
- Ha-ha-ha.
- Go.

01:10:43.745 --> 01:10:45.213
Okay, okay, okay.

01:10:45.345 --> 01:10:46.881
Okay.

01:10:47.014 --> 01:10:49.382
Tough guy. Come on.

01:11:08.236 --> 01:11:09.137
Oh, shit.

01:11:16.544 --> 01:11:17.477
Grenade.

01:11:17.612 --> 01:11:19.312
This will not end good for you

01:11:19.446 --> 01:11:20.915
if you don't let us go now.

01:11:21.048 --> 01:11:22.817
It will once I get
my brother back.

01:11:22.950 --> 01:11:24.919
Hand over the grenade.

01:11:25.052 --> 01:11:26.954
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Wait a second.

01:11:27.088 --> 01:11:29.223
- Do it. Now!
- Okay.

01:11:30.423 --> 01:11:32.693
Okay.

01:11:32.827 --> 01:11:34.896
- Patrick?
- How do you know my name?

01:11:35.029 --> 01:11:38.733
Dude, chill, chill.
It's me. Brax.

01:11:40.433 --> 01:11:41.602
What are you doing here?

01:11:41.736 --> 01:11:43.336
- In Venezuela?
- In Vene... What?

01:11:43.470 --> 01:11:46.073
- Why are you in our fantasy?
- You're in mine.

01:11:57.852 --> 01:11:59.187
Shh...

01:12:08.029 --> 01:12:09.697
Brax? Hey.

01:12:09.831 --> 01:12:11.732
- I'm a good guy.
- We're here to help.

01:12:11.866 --> 01:12:13.366
How many people
are in the house?

01:12:13.501 --> 01:12:15.036
We got a devil, a pig
and a clown.

01:12:15.169 --> 01:12:16.403
And my brother, he's Asian.

01:12:16.537 --> 01:12:18.306
There are models
in the panic room.

01:12:18.438 --> 01:12:19.874
Could we go home now?

01:12:24.278 --> 01:12:26.379
Chastity, real disappointed.

01:12:26.514 --> 01:12:27.882
- Whatever.
- Let's go.

01:12:28.015 --> 01:12:29.717
Come on.
Move, move, move, move.

01:12:45.933 --> 01:12:48.336
- Oof!
- No, no, no, let go!

01:12:55.676 --> 01:12:57.612
- Let go, little man. Let go!
- Give it to me.

01:12:57.745 --> 01:12:59.881
Give me grenade!

01:13:01.215 --> 01:13:03.217
Oh, I mean it, let it go.

01:13:04.585 --> 01:13:06.386
Come on, come on.
Move it, move it.

01:13:12.059 --> 01:13:13.728
Grenade!

01:13:20.001 --> 01:13:22.570
Oh, God, that was close.

01:13:24.872 --> 01:13:26.307
Follow me.

01:13:30.011 --> 01:13:32.113
- Oh...
- Dude, you did it!

01:13:32.246 --> 01:13:33.581
- Ha, ha!
- We did it!

01:13:33.714 --> 01:13:35.783
- Oh, buddy! Oh!
- Oh! Oh!

01:13:35.917 --> 01:13:38.619
- I'm so happy you're alive!
- Thanks.

01:13:38.753 --> 01:13:40.288
If he'd have thrown
that grenade...

01:13:40.420 --> 01:13:43.090
You would've sacrificed
yourself.

01:13:43.224 --> 01:13:44.725
That's why you're my hero.

01:13:46.961 --> 01:13:49.462
You did something
I could never do.

01:13:49.597 --> 01:13:51.699
I wouldn't
sell yourself short, Ali.

01:13:51.832 --> 01:13:53.935
I can't believe the models
locked us out.

01:13:54.068 --> 01:13:55.903
I cannot believe
I ever let Jenni go.

01:13:56.037 --> 01:13:59.573
When I get home, I'm gonna tell
her, she's my moon and my stars.

01:14:01.142 --> 01:14:02.610
JD?

01:14:02.743 --> 01:14:03.644
JD?

01:14:05.713 --> 01:14:07.480
- JD!
- Cover rear!

01:14:08.816 --> 01:14:09.750
JD!

01:14:16.456 --> 01:14:17.525
JD?

01:14:19.827 --> 01:14:22.363
- We have to go. Now!
- Why is this happening?

01:14:44.118 --> 01:14:46.921
We can't kill these things!
Get out of here!

01:14:56.397 --> 01:14:57.298
Come on!

01:15:01.102 --> 01:15:02.536
No!

01:15:22.223 --> 01:15:25.192
The hotel's close. We just need
to get there and find a phone.

01:15:25.326 --> 01:15:27.762
Yeah, like we're just gonna be
able to waltz in

01:15:27.895 --> 01:15:30.731
- and make a phone call.
- Look, Damon was right.

01:15:30.865 --> 01:15:33.701
I owe you an apology,
so I'm sorry.

01:15:33.834 --> 01:15:35.870
I'm sorry I brought you
into all this.

01:15:36.003 --> 01:15:40.241
I didn't think any of it would
be real. I can prove it. Ha...

01:15:40.374 --> 01:15:43.911
<i>She looks better than Tupac.</i>

01:15:44.045 --> 01:15:45.413
You recorded this?

01:15:45.546 --> 01:15:47.715
I fantasized about
getting revenge for years.

01:15:47.848 --> 01:15:49.884
Can you blame me
for wanting to document it?

01:15:50.017 --> 01:15:51.919
I thought you were
a hologram.

01:15:52.053 --> 01:15:54.855
And here is the proof
that I saved you.

01:15:56.157 --> 01:15:57.892
See? I used the Taser thing

01:15:58.025 --> 01:16:00.294
and the water to take him down.

01:16:00.428 --> 01:16:03.030
You want a prize
for not letting me die?

01:16:03.164 --> 01:16:06.700
I know asking
for all of this was crazy,

01:16:06.834 --> 01:16:08.903
but, please,
you have to believe me.

01:16:09.036 --> 01:16:10.571
I thought it was fake.

01:16:10.704 --> 01:16:13.774
How did you figure out
it was actually me?

01:16:13.908 --> 01:16:18.112
When your real husband answered
the phone, I... Wait.

01:16:28.022 --> 01:16:30.091
- I don't think I can do this.
- You have to.

01:16:40.868 --> 01:16:43.370
- <i>What do you want, Sloane?</i>
- Will, please don't hang up!

01:16:43.505 --> 01:16:46.140
Uh, I need your help.
I've been kidnapped.

01:16:46.273 --> 01:16:50.611
I've been taken
to some island somewhere.

01:16:50.744 --> 01:16:52.581
<i>Oh, cut the bullshit.</i>

01:16:52.713 --> 01:16:54.715
Please, I am telling you
the truth.

01:16:54.849 --> 01:16:56.717
<i>Why should I believe you?</i>

01:17:03.190 --> 01:17:05.292
You probably shouldn't.

01:17:07.661 --> 01:17:09.029
Not after what I did to you.

01:17:10.231 --> 01:17:12.366
We used to be happy, Will.

01:17:13.667 --> 01:17:15.169
And then...

01:17:17.004 --> 01:17:18.639
I don't know.

01:17:20.174 --> 01:17:22.309
I'm not trying to make excuses,

01:17:22.443 --> 01:17:25.479
but I felt you pulling away from
me, so I wanted to hurt you.

01:17:25.614 --> 01:17:28.115
It's what I've done
my whole life, I...

01:17:28.249 --> 01:17:32.119
I hurt people
who don't deserve it.

01:17:40.861 --> 01:17:43.230
And I am so sorry.

01:17:43.364 --> 01:17:46.066
There is no defending

01:17:46.200 --> 01:17:48.503
the way that I treated you.

01:17:50.505 --> 01:17:54.141
And I'll understand
if you can never forgive me.

01:17:58.212 --> 01:17:59.747
<i>Do you think
this fixes anything?</i>

01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:01.048
Not even close.

01:18:02.383 --> 01:18:04.485
<i>Okay. Um...</i>

01:18:04.619 --> 01:18:07.154
<i>What do you need me to do?</i>

01:18:07.288 --> 01:18:08.789
I have a phone number.

01:18:08.923 --> 01:18:10.391
I need you to call it

01:18:10.525 --> 01:18:13.827
and tell them
that Damon needs the plane.

01:18:13.961 --> 01:18:15.996
<i>Damon? Do I even wanna know?</i>

01:18:16.130 --> 01:18:18.232
No, it's not what you think.

01:18:18.365 --> 01:18:20.635
I'll explain everything
when I get home.

01:18:20.768 --> 01:18:22.504
Will...

01:18:22.637 --> 01:18:24.038
thank you.

01:18:37.952 --> 01:18:39.720
Come on, Gwen, please breathe.

01:18:39.853 --> 01:18:41.523
Breathe, breathe.

01:18:41.656 --> 01:18:42.657
Please.

01:18:44.291 --> 01:18:46.093
Oh, good girl.

01:18:48.796 --> 01:18:51.031
What are you...?
What are you doing here?

01:18:52.800 --> 01:18:55.102
You got your fantasy redo.

01:18:55.236 --> 01:18:58.573
Did it work? Did you save him?

01:18:58.707 --> 01:19:00.575
No.

01:19:00.709 --> 01:19:03.344
I think this is
someone else's fantasy.

01:19:03.477 --> 01:19:04.778
Where are the others?

01:19:04.912 --> 01:19:06.380
Okay.

01:19:06.514 --> 01:19:09.350
Damon's pilot
should be here any minute.

01:19:13.954 --> 01:19:14.922
Grab one.

01:19:17.191 --> 01:19:18.092
Okay.

01:19:22.029 --> 01:19:24.798
- Whatever comes out of there...
- We'll deal with it.

01:19:24.932 --> 01:19:26.400
Together.

01:19:41.915 --> 01:19:43.417
Patrick? Brax?

01:19:44.818 --> 01:19:46.820
What...? How did you find us?

01:19:46.954 --> 01:19:48.255
We're looking for Roarke.

01:19:48.389 --> 01:19:49.624
Who are you?

01:19:49.758 --> 01:19:51.425
I'm her fantasy.

01:19:53.394 --> 01:19:54.495
Not like that.

01:19:55.829 --> 01:19:57.298
Where's JD?

01:20:02.737 --> 01:20:05.973
- He didn't make it.
- We have to get off this island.

01:20:06.106 --> 01:20:08.008
Let me grab the map.

01:20:08.142 --> 01:20:09.877
A plane is on its way. Come on.

01:20:10.010 --> 01:20:11.045
Head for the dock.

01:20:11.178 --> 01:20:13.113
- Head for the dock! Let's go!
- Go!

01:20:13.247 --> 01:20:14.315
Back, back, back!

01:20:14.448 --> 01:20:15.784
Hello, my friends.

01:20:15.916 --> 01:20:18.252
- Roarke, you son of a bitch.
- I warned you.

01:20:18.385 --> 01:20:20.954
Fantasies rarely play out
as you would expect.

01:20:21.088 --> 01:20:22.791
Play out? My brother's dead!

01:20:22.923 --> 01:20:24.958
I could not save him,
just like Mr. Sullivan

01:20:25.092 --> 01:20:28.829
- couldn't save his father.
- Ah!

01:20:28.962 --> 01:20:31.865
The staff will do anything
to protect me.

01:20:31.999 --> 01:20:35.169
The island gives them
a taste of their fantasies.

01:20:35.302 --> 01:20:37.171
They give me their loyalty.

01:20:37.304 --> 01:20:40.140
And who are you loyal to?
Do they know?

01:20:40.274 --> 01:20:41.942
Know what?

01:20:42.076 --> 01:20:44.311
We weren't brought here
to have our own fantasy.

01:20:44.445 --> 01:20:46.781
We were brought here to be
part of someone else's.

01:20:46.914 --> 01:20:49.651
- Because of Nick Taylor.
- Who's Nick Taylor?

01:20:49.784 --> 01:20:51.553
He was our roommate.

01:20:51.686 --> 01:20:55.824
- He died, six years ago.
- In a fire that I started.

01:20:55.956 --> 01:20:57.559
I had just moved
into the building.

01:20:57.692 --> 01:20:59.527
I put a kettle on for tea,

01:20:59.661 --> 01:21:02.229
and I forgot to turn
the burner off when I left.

01:21:02.363 --> 01:21:05.132
My fantasy took me back there.
I saw you and JD.

01:21:05.265 --> 01:21:08.001
JD wanted to check
on Nick's room,

01:21:08.135 --> 01:21:12.005
but I thought he was out with
a girl, so... I made JD run.

01:21:12.139 --> 01:21:13.307
You were there.

01:21:14.341 --> 01:21:15.543
You did nothing.

01:21:17.579 --> 01:21:21.549
- I didn't see you.
- Nick was in one of my classes.

01:21:21.683 --> 01:21:23.417
He asked me out.

01:21:24.753 --> 01:21:26.186
But I couldn't believe

01:21:26.320 --> 01:21:28.623
that someone was
actually interested in me.

01:21:28.757 --> 01:21:32.627
I was supposed to see him later
that night, but I got cold feet.

01:21:32.761 --> 01:21:35.129
He shouldn't have been home.
He should've been with me.

01:21:35.262 --> 01:21:38.065
Everyone who got off that plane
has a hand in Nick's death.

01:21:38.198 --> 01:21:39.768
So this is
one big revenge fantasy?

01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:41.402
Correct.

01:21:42.670 --> 01:21:44.304
So how does this end?

01:21:44.438 --> 01:21:46.708
With your deaths.
Your lives for Nick's,

01:21:46.841 --> 01:21:48.375
if that's
what the island demands.

01:21:48.510 --> 01:21:51.880
- Call it off.
- You know I do not have a choice.

01:21:55.082 --> 01:21:57.251
- The plane.
- Get them out of here.

01:21:57.384 --> 01:21:58.919
Come on!

01:22:03.190 --> 01:22:04.925
Someone has found his courage.

01:22:05.794 --> 01:22:07.729
The plane. The plane!

01:22:11.098 --> 01:22:12.933
- There it is! Hey!
- Hey!

01:22:13.066 --> 01:22:15.936
- Hey! Over there!
- Hey!

01:22:17.672 --> 01:22:19.940
- Hey!
- Oh, my God. We're going home.

01:22:21.776 --> 01:22:23.277
Who are you protecting?

01:22:23.410 --> 01:22:25.212
Where are the others?

01:22:32.252 --> 01:22:33.588
Stop.

01:22:34.589 --> 01:22:36.457
She wants them all together.

01:22:41.295 --> 01:22:43.397
- Oh, my God.
- What the...?

01:22:45.867 --> 01:22:48.969
- No! No!
- Who is that?

01:22:49.102 --> 01:22:50.070
Guys.

01:22:50.204 --> 01:22:52.473
- Come on, let's go!
- Go! Run!

01:23:08.422 --> 01:23:09.791
Shit.

01:23:09.924 --> 01:23:12.125
We're safe here for...
For a minute.

01:23:12.259 --> 01:23:15.763
Okay, not to be negative,
but we're gonna die here.

01:23:15.897 --> 01:23:17.998
- We're not throwing in the towel.
- She's right.

01:23:18.131 --> 01:23:21.001
- Everyone else works for Roarke.
- Unless they don't.

01:23:23.270 --> 01:23:25.673
Julia, she pulled me
from the fire.

01:23:25.807 --> 01:23:27.341
She saved my life.

01:23:27.474 --> 01:23:29.811
Roarke's servants wouldn't
interfere in a fantasy.

01:23:29.944 --> 01:23:32.145
Maybe she's not his assistant.
Maybe she is a guest.

01:23:32.279 --> 01:23:33.848
She did say she
just started there.

01:23:33.982 --> 01:23:35.315
She could be Nick's mom.

01:23:35.449 --> 01:23:37.986
He always told me
how controlling she was,

01:23:38.118 --> 01:23:40.855
and Julia's eyes,
they look a lot like Nick's.

01:23:40.989 --> 01:23:43.257
I saw her coughing up blood.

01:23:43.390 --> 01:23:45.192
This could be her dying wish.

01:23:45.325 --> 01:23:48.495
Okay, but then why would
she save you from the fire?

01:23:48.630 --> 01:23:50.665
So Gwen could tell us
why we're here.

01:23:50.798 --> 01:23:52.534
It's not really
a satisfying revenge

01:23:52.667 --> 01:23:54.903
- if your victims are oblivious.
- So we go to her.

01:23:55.035 --> 01:23:56.905
We apologize,
try to make this right.

01:23:57.037 --> 01:23:59.206
Someone that brought us
to this island to die

01:23:59.339 --> 01:24:02.209
is probably looking for a little
more than just an apology.

01:24:02.342 --> 01:24:05.780
If we can't stop her,
maybe we can stop the island.

01:24:07.214 --> 01:24:09.283
Yeah, there's a spring
with an ancient stone.

01:24:09.416 --> 01:24:12.452
- It makes the fantasies possible.
- The water in the spring.

01:24:12.587 --> 01:24:14.889
JD was right.
Roarke did spike our drinks.

01:24:15.023 --> 01:24:17.692
We destroy the spring,
then we end the fantasies?

01:24:17.825 --> 01:24:20.060
- It's worth a shot.
- How do we do that?

01:24:21.261 --> 01:24:22.396
With this.

01:24:39.313 --> 01:24:40.949
Anything else we should know?

01:24:41.081 --> 01:24:43.017
It's a maze, so stick together.

01:24:43.150 --> 01:24:46.788
And there are sea snakes,
so don't, you know, freak out.

01:24:46.921 --> 01:24:49.122
Did she say sea snakes?

01:24:54.428 --> 01:24:57.397
We had a guide before, and even
he almost got lost, but I'm...

01:24:57.532 --> 01:24:59.901
I'm 99 percent positive
it's this way.

01:25:03.738 --> 01:25:05.105
Listen for the spring.

01:25:05.238 --> 01:25:07.742
It sounds like dripping water.

01:25:07.875 --> 01:25:09.276
Whole island sounds like that.

01:25:10.511 --> 01:25:12.212
I think I hear it.

01:25:16.551 --> 01:25:18.218
Gwen?

01:25:18.352 --> 01:25:19.821
Gwen?

01:25:19.954 --> 01:25:21.556
Shit.

01:25:22.857 --> 01:25:25.359
We lost Gwen and Brax.

01:25:25.492 --> 01:25:27.394
Give me the grenade.

01:25:27.528 --> 01:25:29.363
I'll find the spring,
you go find them.

01:25:29.496 --> 01:25:31.099
No, no. It's too dangerous.

01:25:31.231 --> 01:25:33.034
If you find the spring,
call out for me.

01:25:33.166 --> 01:25:34.769
I'll follow your voice

01:25:34.902 --> 01:25:36.436
and then blow it.

01:25:42.844 --> 01:25:44.311
Sloane?

01:26:41.301 --> 01:26:43.137
Just sea snakes.

01:27:06.961 --> 01:27:08.596
<i>Melanie?</i>

01:27:52.740 --> 01:27:53.674
Brax.

01:27:55.442 --> 01:27:56.844
Am I gonna be okay?

01:28:00.748 --> 01:28:03.283
- We should've never come here.
- You gotta save me, dude.

01:28:03.416 --> 01:28:06.286
I'd do it for you.
I did everything for you.

01:28:06.419 --> 01:28:07.688
I tried.

01:28:07.822 --> 01:28:09.422
It should've been you instead.

01:28:09.557 --> 01:28:11.424
Mom and Dad love me more.

01:28:11.559 --> 01:28:13.661
They already wish
you were dead. Guh!

01:28:13.795 --> 01:28:16.864
- No.
- Aah! Ugh, aah!

01:28:16.998 --> 01:28:18.766
JD, no! No!

01:28:35.216 --> 01:28:36.784
OMG.

01:28:36.918 --> 01:28:39.587
What a pathetic loser.

01:28:39.720 --> 01:28:43.524
- What are you?
- I'm the real you.

01:28:43.658 --> 01:28:47.094
- The coolest girl in school.
- No.

01:28:47.228 --> 01:28:49.263
That's not who I am anymore.

01:28:49.396 --> 01:28:52.700
There's no defending the way
that I treated you.

01:28:52.834 --> 01:28:55.368
And I'll understand
if you never forgive me.

01:28:55.503 --> 01:28:57.337
Stop it! I meant that.

01:28:57.470 --> 01:28:59.540
People never change.

01:28:59.674 --> 01:29:01.709
They just get better
at hiding who they are.

01:29:01.843 --> 01:29:03.211
This isn't real.

01:29:05.913 --> 01:29:06.981
You are not real.

01:29:08.749 --> 01:29:10.450
I will never be you again.

01:29:30.204 --> 01:29:32.006
Mommy, come see.

01:29:33.473 --> 01:29:35.109
Lila, what are you doing?

01:29:35.243 --> 01:29:36.878
I killed Daddy.

01:29:38.679 --> 01:29:42.717
- Oh, God. Why?
- Because you don't deserve him.

01:29:42.850 --> 01:29:44.785
You don't deserve me.

01:29:44.919 --> 01:29:47.855
You don't deserve anything good
after what you did.

01:29:47.989 --> 01:29:50.691
- Oh, Lila...
- My friend was right.

01:29:50.825 --> 01:29:53.861
You ruin everything.

01:29:53.995 --> 01:29:55.296
Friend?

01:29:59.567 --> 01:30:01.903
- Hi, Gwen.
- Oh...

01:30:19.787 --> 01:30:22.590
Oh, God, Nick!
Please, I'm so sorry.

01:30:22.723 --> 01:30:25.126
"Sorry"
won't bring me back, Gwen.

01:30:25.259 --> 01:30:28.863
"Sorry" won't keep me
from gagging on the smoke,

01:30:28.996 --> 01:30:31.265
from burning alive.

01:30:33.734 --> 01:30:36.137
Do you know
what that feels like?

01:30:41.108 --> 01:30:42.076
You're not him.

01:30:53.854 --> 01:30:55.589
Please, Nick,
you said it yourself,

01:30:55.723 --> 01:30:57.425
none of this
is gonna bring you back.

01:30:57.558 --> 01:30:58.893
I'm not the one doing this.

01:30:59.026 --> 01:31:00.795
I know who is,
and she can have me.

01:31:00.928 --> 01:31:02.163
Just let the others go.

01:31:02.296 --> 01:31:04.832
Do you hear me, Julia?!

01:31:04.966 --> 01:31:06.767
Who's Julia?

01:31:34.762 --> 01:31:35.830
Melanie!

01:31:41.936 --> 01:31:43.571
Patrick?

01:31:48.009 --> 01:31:49.977
Patrick! Gwen?

01:31:50.111 --> 01:31:52.179
- Are you okay?
- I heard screaming.

01:31:52.313 --> 01:31:54.682
I just saw Nick.
This is not Julia's fantasy.

01:31:54.815 --> 01:31:57.551
- Then whose is it?
- It's not Patrick's.

01:31:59.020 --> 01:32:01.322
Guy just can't seem
to save anybody.

01:32:01.455 --> 01:32:03.324
Not even himself.

01:32:03.457 --> 01:32:05.426
As soon as I saw
this place, I...

01:32:05.559 --> 01:32:08.429
I knew I had to bring
everyone here where there's...

01:32:08.596 --> 01:32:10.364
no escape from my fantasy.

01:32:10.498 --> 01:32:13.868
- Your fantasy?
- Yes. The one I asked for

01:32:14.001 --> 01:32:17.872
before any of you had
even heard of Fantasy Island.

01:32:18.005 --> 01:32:22.376
When I first met Nick, it was
like I'd known him for years.

01:32:22.511 --> 01:32:26.047
And we got coffee, and we ended
up talking the entire night.

01:32:26.180 --> 01:32:28.582
And I wasn't worried
about saying something stupid

01:32:28.716 --> 01:32:31.185
or trying to be cool

01:32:31.318 --> 01:32:35.122
because he made me feel
comfortable in my own skin.

01:32:35.256 --> 01:32:38.092
We made plans to see
each other again that night.

01:32:38.225 --> 01:32:41.228
It would've been
our first real date.

01:32:41.362 --> 01:32:44.432
I wanted to look super pretty,
so I bought a new dress,

01:32:44.565 --> 01:32:46.100
I got this necklace.

01:32:46.233 --> 01:32:49.703
I got to our meeting place,
and I waited.

01:32:49.837 --> 01:32:52.840
Hour passed, then two,
but no Nick.

01:32:52.973 --> 01:32:56.410
I started to think, "Sloane
was right. I am worthless.

01:32:56.545 --> 01:32:58.679
No one could ever possibly
love me,

01:32:58.813 --> 01:33:00.515
and Nick must have realized
that too.

01:33:00.648 --> 01:33:03.217
Why else would he be
doing this to me?"

01:33:03.350 --> 01:33:07.088
I stayed there all night,
torturing myself!

01:33:07.221 --> 01:33:10.191
And when I got home,
I read about the fire,

01:33:10.324 --> 01:33:13.461
and my heart shattered.

01:33:15.096 --> 01:33:18.199
I was this close
to my real-life fantasy,

01:33:18.332 --> 01:33:21.635
but all of you,
you turned it into a nightmare!

01:33:21.769 --> 01:33:23.737
You could've had anything
you wanted here.

01:33:23.871 --> 01:33:26.240
- You could've had Nick back.
- It would've been fake.

01:33:26.373 --> 01:33:28.075
Our future was stolen,

01:33:28.209 --> 01:33:31.712
and all of you, you just
moved on with your lives.

01:33:31.846 --> 01:33:34.248
Nick deserves better.
Nick deserves justice.

01:33:34.381 --> 01:33:35.983
Melanie.

01:33:40.254 --> 01:33:43.624
Don't you mean
"psycho stalker freak"?

01:33:43.757 --> 01:33:45.693
There is hate in my heart,

01:33:45.826 --> 01:33:47.661
and it grows every day.

01:33:47.795 --> 01:33:51.332
You put it there! This is
as much your fault as theirs.

01:33:51.465 --> 01:33:55.169
- But you saved me.
- That was an act.

01:33:55.302 --> 01:33:58.005
- Why?
- So you could see my worth.

01:33:58.139 --> 01:34:01.610
Your very life on this island,
it depended on me.

01:34:01.742 --> 01:34:02.710
I wouldn't do that!

01:34:06.947 --> 01:34:10.050
Really?
You thought I needed you?

01:34:10.184 --> 01:34:12.953
I was using you
to get off this island.

01:34:13.087 --> 01:34:15.322
- Shut up.
- I didn't think it was possible.

01:34:15.456 --> 01:34:18.359
You're actually more pathetic
now than you ever were then.

01:34:18.492 --> 01:34:19.793
Shut up!

01:34:26.667 --> 01:34:28.035
Go, go!

01:34:31.839 --> 01:34:33.807
Holy shit. She went out
with him one time?

01:34:33.941 --> 01:34:36.710
I can hear it. The spring.

01:34:44.385 --> 01:34:45.786
Hey!

01:34:46.854 --> 01:34:48.222
Come on!

01:35:14.014 --> 01:35:15.550
What are you waiting for? Do it.

01:35:15.684 --> 01:35:18.085
It's reflecting her fantasy.

01:35:21.822 --> 01:35:24.091
Please do not do that,
Ms. Olsen.

01:35:24.225 --> 01:35:26.093
Julia is your fantasy?

01:35:26.227 --> 01:35:28.597
- My wife.
- She said she just started here.

01:35:28.762 --> 01:35:30.565
She believes that, yes.

01:35:30.699 --> 01:35:33.568
You see, my wish
was to have her back,

01:35:33.702 --> 01:35:35.936
just as I met her, forever.

01:35:36.070 --> 01:35:39.039
So she appears not knowing me,

01:35:39.173 --> 01:35:42.943
and soon, she takes ill,
just as she did before.

01:35:43.077 --> 01:35:44.878
That plays out
again and again.

01:35:45.012 --> 01:35:47.348
Courting her became too painful.

01:35:47.481 --> 01:35:50.818
So I lie to her.
I tell her she's my assistant.

01:35:52.753 --> 01:35:55.122
When Melanie requested
her fantasy,

01:35:55.256 --> 01:35:57.091
I had no choice but to oblige.

01:35:57.224 --> 01:36:00.160
- You can stop her, Roarke.
- No. He can't.

01:36:00.294 --> 01:36:02.997
He's the genie,
and this island is his bottle.

01:36:03.130 --> 01:36:04.566
Trapped forever.

01:36:04.699 --> 01:36:07.468
And if he doesn't give
every guest their fantasy,

01:36:07.602 --> 01:36:09.571
he loses his love.

01:36:09.704 --> 01:36:11.640
You think that's love?

01:36:11.772 --> 01:36:15.142
Letting Julia die over and over
again forever? That's hell.

01:36:15.276 --> 01:36:17.679
She was your wife, Roarke.
She's not anymore.

01:36:17.811 --> 01:36:20.682
She's not even your assistant.
She's your prisoner.

01:36:20.814 --> 01:36:22.816
You have to let her go.

01:36:28.422 --> 01:36:29.624
- I cannot.
- No!

01:36:31.125 --> 01:36:32.026
No!

01:36:36.196 --> 01:36:40.367
I'm sorry. The fantasy must
reach its natural conclusion.

01:36:44.338 --> 01:36:45.640
Those are the rules.

01:36:54.948 --> 01:36:57.184
The guests...

01:36:57.318 --> 01:36:59.486
they're dying.

01:36:59.621 --> 01:37:00.988
I'm dying.

01:37:01.121 --> 01:37:02.856
You'll be fine.

01:37:02.990 --> 01:37:03.957
Soon enough.

01:37:04.091 --> 01:37:05.627
And the others?

01:37:05.760 --> 01:37:08.028
If I interfere
with the island...

01:37:09.798 --> 01:37:11.533
I lose you forever.

01:37:13.334 --> 01:37:14.636
Lose me?

01:37:48.168 --> 01:37:50.204
You have to do something.

01:37:50.337 --> 01:37:53.073
They're not the island's guests.

01:37:53.207 --> 01:37:54.609
They're yours.

01:37:55.976 --> 01:37:57.444
It's not what I want.

01:37:59.514 --> 01:38:02.082
But it's what you have to do.

01:38:23.937 --> 01:38:26.306
Melanie, I am sorry

01:38:26.440 --> 01:38:28.643
your life didn't work out
the way you wanted.

01:38:28.777 --> 01:38:30.477
- Mine didn't either.
- Everybody's sorry

01:38:30.612 --> 01:38:32.413
when it's time
to pay the piper, right?

01:38:32.547 --> 01:38:34.415
I'll pay.

01:38:34.549 --> 01:38:37.985
It was my fault. I could've
saved Nick. Let the others go.

01:38:38.118 --> 01:38:41.455
Oh, my God. Are you still trying
to be like dead daddy?

01:38:41.589 --> 01:38:44.091
Well, you're not a hero.
It was just your fantasy.

01:38:44.224 --> 01:38:45.894
She's right.

01:38:47.762 --> 01:38:49.163
It was his fantasy.

01:38:49.296 --> 01:38:51.398
All of my guests get a fantasy.

01:38:55.936 --> 01:38:58.439
So if you drink the water,
you get one.

01:38:58.573 --> 01:39:00.742
Sloane's fantasy?

01:39:00.875 --> 01:39:03.711
What, that she and her husband
get to be together forever?

01:39:08.048 --> 01:39:09.751
No.

01:39:09.884 --> 01:39:11.886
- That you and Nick do.
- Huh?

01:39:13.387 --> 01:39:15.122
Those are the rules.

01:39:43.050 --> 01:39:45.620
Fantasy fucking Island.

01:39:59.667 --> 01:40:00.668
- Get back!
- Aah!

01:40:16.684 --> 01:40:18.520
Hello?

01:40:22.055 --> 01:40:23.056
Hello?

01:40:26.326 --> 01:40:29.129
Gwen. You okay?

01:40:29.263 --> 01:40:30.932
- Hey.
- Guys?

01:40:34.669 --> 01:40:36.403
What happened?

01:40:37.471 --> 01:40:39.439
You saved us.

01:40:39.574 --> 01:40:42.042
Where's Patrick?

01:40:42.175 --> 01:40:44.913
He died, as a hero.

01:40:51.418 --> 01:40:53.521
He made his father proud.

01:41:16.376 --> 01:41:18.211
One star on Yelp.

01:41:19.647 --> 01:41:20.949
So, what's gonna stop us all

01:41:21.081 --> 01:41:23.718
from exposing this island
and suing you?

01:41:23.851 --> 01:41:27.354
Well, fantasies, Mrs. Maddison,
are a lot like dreams.

01:41:27.487 --> 01:41:29.023
You rarely remember the details,

01:41:29.156 --> 01:41:31.793
but you always remember
how they make you feel.

01:41:31.926 --> 01:41:33.193
Well, I just remembered

01:41:33.327 --> 01:41:35.897
that I wanna get
the hell off this island.

01:41:40.167 --> 01:41:42.469
So, what happens
to you now, Mr. Roarke?

01:41:42.604 --> 01:41:44.371
I stay here,

01:41:44.505 --> 01:41:46.874
protect this place

01:41:47.008 --> 01:41:48.910
and live my life
without regret.

01:42:00.555 --> 01:42:04.124
Technically, you partook
in your brother's fantasy,

01:42:04.257 --> 01:42:07.127
so the island can grant you one.

01:42:07.260 --> 01:42:10.497
I want JD back. I want him
to go home, to have a life.

01:42:10.632 --> 01:42:13.300
In order for that fantasy
to last,

01:42:13.433 --> 01:42:16.638
you would need to stay here.
Forever.

01:42:25.513 --> 01:42:27.949
I was so horrible
to her back then.

01:42:29.784 --> 01:42:32.053
All you can do now
is forgive yourself.

01:42:33.320 --> 01:42:34.689
Okay?

01:42:37.859 --> 01:42:39.861
Oh, excuse me.

01:42:39.994 --> 01:42:42.830
We can't leave yet.
Brax isn't on the plane.

01:42:43.965 --> 01:42:45.332
Yeah.

01:42:47.769 --> 01:42:49.737
I don't think he's coming.

01:42:58.546 --> 01:42:59.747
JD!

01:43:33.313 --> 01:43:37.018
So, what now?

01:43:37.151 --> 01:43:40.588
You work for me. You'll need
a uniform and a name tag.

01:43:40.722 --> 01:43:43.423
Quite the unusual one.
"Brax."

01:43:43.558 --> 01:43:45.660
It's better than
my college nickname.

01:43:45.793 --> 01:43:47.862
Lost a bet, had to get
the dumbest ink ever.
