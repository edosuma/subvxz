SRI IS GOD
There is an ongoing struggle in which
Both teams really go for it.

00:39.583 --> 00:44.872
Now it's a tie and Ice
Wolf is strong ...

00:47.296 --> 00:50.432
And here they come!

00:51.179 --> 00:54.226
What a struggle.

00:54.227 --> 00:57.715
Take them widely.

00:57.716 --> 01:01.730
Go there.
- He shoots. Nice rescue.

01:04.215 --> 01:07.070
What a blow.

01:08.400 --> 01:11.197
They are devastated.

01:12.145 --> 01:14.569
There is a recognizable melody.

01:14.570 --> 01:17.883
The coach calls for the Great
defender, Derek Thompson.

01:18.007 --> 01:21.646
And here comes the Tooth fairy!

01:21.680 --> 01:23.790
Go for it!

02:10.547 --> 02:13.475
What a disservice!

02:13.476 --> 02:17.266
My tooth! My God, my tooth!

02:17.775 --> 02:22.066
And the Tooth fairy, Derek Thompson,
has struck again.

02:30.275 --> 02:35.279
You may not tooth!
And that is the whole tooth
and nothing else!

02:36.022 --> 02:38.998
I pledge allegiance to the tooth.

02:39.779 --> 02:42.822
Open the door for a tooth fairy.

02:42.823 --> 02:49.168
Sanctions Pause No. 14, Derek Thompson.
Fifteen minutes.

02:50.085 --> 02:54.139
Who is the Tooth fairy?
I I'm Tooth fairy!

02:55.204 --> 02:58.220
Stop it. Stop.

02:58.221 --> 03:02.097
I'm not scared, I play hockey.
We have a good time ...

03:02.098 --> 03:05.159
What's going on?
- Thompson, come here.

03:05.160 --> 03:08.150
Meet our future.
- New kid.

03:08.151 --> 03:12.484
He will not be long before he
is detected by the Kings, but ...

03:12.485 --> 03:17.245
while he is here, please
protect him on the ice.

03:17.279 --> 03:19.949
The rest is unimportant. Mick.

03:19.950 --> 03:22.394
Derek Thompson, Mick Donnelly
Our First Line Server.

03:22.395 --> 03:24.211
Donnelly, Thompson this
is your bodyguard.

03:24.309 --> 03:26.099
How's it going?
- Welcome to hockey.

03:26.100 --> 03:29.179
Was there a veteran game today?
I did not know you've played.

03:29.279 --> 03:31.259
I was a big fan of you.

03:32.645 --> 03:35.796
Well, see you later.

03:43.642 --> 03:47.732
Mr. Thompson! Tooth fairy!

03:48.736 --> 03:52.102
I get your autograph?
- Yes, of course.

03:52.103 --> 03:53.697
What is your name?
- Gabe.

03:53.698 --> 03:58.400
I am in my third team in hockey league.
And my team won championships.

03:58.465 --> 04:05.096
Fantastic. Good for you.
- When I play so
high as you did.

04:06.839 --> 04:10.430
You are doing a lot of hockey, h?
- Yes, almost every day.

04:10.431 --> 04:13.067
And I take him
almost every day.

04:13.068 --> 04:15.918
How old are you?
- Eight.

04:15.919 --> 04:21.454
Ok, so you have eight.
And you are third after two others?

04:21.456 --> 04:24.257
Almost nine.

04:24.258 --> 04:28.548
Somewhere in this country is a
7-year against the 12-year record ...

04:28.549 --> 04:31.227
and he makes them.

04:31.228 --> 04:33.830
As if they are overwhelmed
of a Cambodian lion.

04:33.865 --> 04:35.876
And so many children in each league.

04:36.040 --> 04:39.804
And when the time comes,
kids will do.

04:39.805 --> 04:42.462
Imagine reaching the NHL.

04:42.524 --> 04:45.561
Probably not,
but do it.

04:45.562 --> 04:47.417
Put them out of your school ...

04:47.418 --> 04:49.868
but should not you, and before
you can do something ...

04:49.869 --> 04:53.012
They are nowhere.

04:54.235 --> 04:58.152
Lower your expectations.

04:58.855 --> 05:01.863
Then you'll be happy.

05:02.838 --> 05:06.261
Please.

05:11.913 --> 05:15.326
I want to suck your blood.

05:15.327 --> 05:18.898
What?
What are you looking at, and
why are you laughing so?

05:18.899 --> 05:23.112
Why are not you afraid?
- Because the chips.

05:23.113 --> 05:28.989
I can not eat?
They are bad for vampires.

05:28.990 --> 05:32.797
I'm going to die.

05:32.798 --> 05:35.350
I have an idea.
- I can not speak.

05:35.430 --> 05:37.518
Feel dead.

05:37.519 --> 05:40.161
Mom, my tooth came out.

05:42.000 --> 05:46.680
Congratulations.
- The Tooth fairy visits
me tonight.

05:46.681 --> 05:51.376
Let's see.
You are such a big girl.

05:51.601 --> 05:54.775
I'm the tooth fairy.

05:54.776 --> 05:58.848
You were a vampire?
This is contradictory mythology.

06:00.600 --> 06:04.060
I have a lot of homework.
Can I go?

06:07.687 --> 06:11.511
Mama, it's time to go as Derek
can make the child is ready.

06:11.512 --> 06:14.665
Not yet. You take your pajamas?

06:16.553 --> 06:19.991
Would it help if you
Randy deals again?

06:19.992 --> 06:24.392
I will do it.
If I'm not alone with him.

06:25.536 --> 06:29.845
Renee is here. A little ketchup.

06:34.140 --> 06:36.724
Tooth Fairy ...
- I got it.

06:36.725 --> 06:41.548
Listen, I have my pajamas.
- Dracula is back.

06:41.549 --> 06:45.804
Chips, I love it!

06:47.660 --> 06:50.588
What do you think about Donnelly?
- He's quick.

06:50.589 --> 06:54.458
You think the next Kruchky.
- I love him already
as a long lost brother.

06:54.864 --> 06:57.666
Can we just play?
- Part.

06:57.667 --> 07:01.243
I have some money shortages,
but this signature ...

07:01.244 --> 07:05.415
Tooth fairy says.

07:05.449 --> 07:09.019
Ten U.S. dollars each, so this is a $ 100
I'm in..

07:09.020 --> 07:12.669
You really should pay.
- I.

07:12.670 --> 07:15.400
I insist warranty.

07:15.855 --> 07:18.851
I'll be back.
- He took his card.

07:18.929 --> 07:21.698
Seriously?
- Passport, so we can play.

07:21.699 --> 07:25.297
Do not take the kids
or something?

07:38.382 --> 07:40.784
I'm home.
- Hello, darling.

07:40.785 --> 07:43.070
H guys.

07:43.071 --> 07:46.721
What juice?
- We have just juice.

07:46.722 --> 07:50.454
I am a little tired.

07:52.934 --> 07:56.902
Mother, mother!

07:58.023 --> 08:00.394
What is it, honey?
- My tooth is gone.

08:00.429 --> 08:02.899
The Tooth fairy took him.

08:02.933 --> 08:06.570
But there is no money.
I saw all

08:06.571 --> 08:09.391
Let's see, it will be
stored somewhere.

08:09.392 --> 08:13.392
The Vampire is back!
- No vampire time.

08:13.426 --> 08:15.580
It is neither.

08:15.678 --> 08:21.480
She went down first and see what your teeth
worth the money they bring.

08:21.515 --> 08:24.620
Right, Derek?
- How it works.

08:24.621 --> 08:30.105
No, it does not.
You put your tooth under
pillow ...

08:30.243 --> 08:36.322
flies in the Tooth fairy, tooth and
Leave a dollar.

08:36.356 --> 08:38.624
Where is it?

08:39.477 --> 08:44.552
Tell me if the Tooth fairy has been
because I have 5, 10 ...

08:50.212 --> 08:53.945
You're a big girl now, so
we solve it as if ...

08:53.946 --> 08:56.799
there is no ...

08:56.800 --> 08:59.754
Here it is.
- How was it there?

08:59.755 --> 09:02.973
You have it in your sleep
on site has undergone.

09:08.923 --> 09:10.944
I forgot.

09:10.945 --> 09:14.233
And then tell them that they
Tooth fairy is not real?

09:14.333 --> 09:19.575
There are so many people unhappy because
they stick to "what if".

09:19.600 --> 09:21.000
So dreams are bad?

09:21.001 --> 09:23.451
But if they lead to unrealistic
expectations.

09:23.485 --> 09:25.175
This is ridiculous.
- I know.

09:25.176 --> 09:27.440
I go to bed.

09:27.441 --> 09:30.491
You ... 're gone.

09:31.484 --> 09:36.430
Word is not dramatic.
- I?
I tell her
fantasies stops.

10:10.000 --> 10:12.523
What?

10:12.524 --> 10:17.521
Think of a fee. Subpoena.

10:20.018 --> 10:23.134
What?

11:44.090 --> 11:47.968
Thompson, Derek Thompson?
- Yes, God, I am.

11:47.969 --> 11:51.303
Are you God?
- Thompson Are You?

11:52.342 --> 11:55.442
Are you God?
- No, your social worker Tracy.

11:55.443 --> 11:57.387
What is this?

11:57.731 --> 12:01.240
How disappointing.
- Come on, please.

12:02.067 --> 12:05.320
No thanks. Very elegant.

12:05.686 --> 12:09.219
But what is?
- No idea.

12:09.220 --> 12:11.555
But what is?
- Who is this guy?

12:11.556 --> 12:13.725
Slayer dreams, illuminates your soul.

12:13.927 --> 12:16.890
What have I done?
Why am I here? Where am I?

12:16.987 --> 12:19.341
Nobody likes you here,
or your position ...

12:19.439 --> 12:23.952
The way you go, "Why here?
What is the big wings? ".

12:24.714 --> 12:29.683
We have a problem?
- Yes, because you just said.

12:29.684 --> 12:33.741
Tracy was nevertheless
what a beautiful girl.

12:33.775 --> 12:35.142
Not laugh, it's not funny.

12:35.143 --> 12:38.671
This is strike 2, strike 3, you will not.
- What happens after 3?

12:39.404 --> 12:41.818
4th Strike

12:42.105 --> 12:46.764
We take care of your uniform so as
your registration and your workout.

12:46.765 --> 12:50.893
Training for what?
- You, Mr. Thompson ...

12:50.894 --> 12:54.838
will spend time at which
a tooth fairy.

12:59.183 --> 13:02.516
A Tooth fairy ...

13:02.517 --> 13:04.969
Excuse me.

13:04.970 --> 13:07.951
Quiet all, he is harmless.

13:08.045 --> 13:10.527
Okay?

13:10.528 --> 13:15.389
100 kg man because you have more than 8 Feen it.
Hands off.

13:15.390 --> 13:17.983
It is very elegant.

13:17.984 --> 13:22.067
Where were we?
- Help, please!
I'm in a nightmare!

13:22.068 --> 13:25.250
Please, help me!
- The nightmare begins.

13:27.369 --> 13:31.688
Did you try to the title?
Feeling Lucky?

13:35.397 --> 13:38.756
Maybe. Hold it down.

13:38.757 --> 13:42.283
I can not see anything.
Give them back
not a good idea.

13:42.318 --> 13:47.001
You want a piece?
Ready to start.

13:47.457 --> 13:51.345
You have just one big mistake.

13:51.609 --> 13:55.384
He has a magic wand.
Now a rabbit from a hat.

13:55.385 --> 13:58.391
Feen fight!

13:58.392 --> 14:00.851
Give him.
- Now I have one too.

14:00.852 --> 14:06.551
In just imagine the hammer.
Sladge Brothers and Jack.
Who do you want?

14:07.639 --> 14:11.347
Fantastic.
You chose the wrong fee.

14:13.176 --> 14:16.782
Wand. My heaven.

14:16.783 --> 14:19.091
I've broken him.

14:19.188 --> 14:22.128
What's going on?

14:29.274 --> 14:33.046
I will tell you.
- He keeps talking.

14:33.047 --> 14:35.324
He talked about Hammer brothers.
They are still in town.

14:35.325 --> 14:39.091
Stop it!
You behave like midgets.

14:39.092 --> 14:44.146
He has a bad behavior.
- I know his behavior
is good enough.

14:44.902 --> 14:46.588
Hello, Mr. Thompson.
- Hello.

14:46.639 --> 14:50.508
Sorry for your uniforms.
Budget problems.

14:50.509 --> 14:53.130
Tracy will.
- He, sure.

14:53.131 --> 14:58.596
You are guilty of
spread disbelief.

14:58.597 --> 15:03.120
Dreams kill, murder
of imagination ...

15:03.121 --> 15:07.098
what with ...
- Is it because ...

15:07.396 --> 15:11.353
I have not finished talking.
Leek that so?

15:11.354 --> 15:16.620
No idea that everyone here has a British accent.
- You took me back.

15:16.621 --> 15:20.536
I must not effective enough?

15:20.537 --> 15:25.095
I understand why men are not officers
or suspended firefighters, but ...

15:25.096 --> 15:28.771
a pair of wings to fly
all the way out the door.

15:28.772 --> 15:32.664
Would not you have more respect for a
person with wings or without wings?

15:33.364 --> 15:37.087
You have no idea which
I am responsible.

15:37.088 --> 15:40.848
I can fly out and do
something crazy.

15:40.849 --> 15:45.064
Maybe I spit fire.
You do not know.

15:47.707 --> 15:51.272
Sorry I interrupted.

15:52.145 --> 15:56.022
It was better.
To pay your debt
humanity ...

15:56.023 --> 15:59.571
you are ordered to spend
time as a tooth fairy.

15:59.572 --> 16:03.999
Criminal standard is one week.
But since you have the courage ...

16:04.000 --> 16:08.833
Their real Tooth fairy who ...

16:08.834 --> 16:12.099
and thus mock everything
we stand for ...

16:12.100 --> 16:15.755
I rebuke you in two weeks.

16:15.789 --> 16:18.188
No, no. It is unfair.

16:18.189 --> 16:20.623
Pause.
- Again, unbelievable.

16:20.946 --> 16:23.463
Take him away.
Make sure he gets it
correct uniform ...

16:23.464 --> 16:26.260
and bring him to the flying lessons.
- What?

16:26.294 --> 16:30.958
First you meet Jerry.

16:32.012 --> 16:35.432
Excuse me, moederfee.
I have one last question.

16:36.153 --> 16:40.041
Let this hole is my
Tutu look fat?

16:42.203 --> 16:46.637
Yes, great.

16:49.024 --> 16:51.705
Scandalous.

16:56.888 --> 16:59.668
Good.
- Okay, you have the
male version.

16:59.669 --> 17:02.829
Turn time around.
- I give you a new
turning on the nose.

17:02.830 --> 17:04.627
What does it mean?
- A threat.

17:04.699 --> 17:06.938
It seems that you will do it.
- No, I turn on your nose.

17:06.939 --> 17:08.776
It is clearer.
- What is it?

17:09.655 --> 17:12.421
Pathetic, just a child.

17:12.422 --> 17:15.414
Chicken is fine.
I do not hate chicken.

17:16.048 --> 17:18.449
I think the chicken well.
I hate your chest piece.

17:18.450 --> 17:22.801
I will, goodbye.
Trouw not a gnome.

17:22.836 --> 17:24.194
Dream killer.

17:24.195 --> 17:26.769
It felt good to
lie to the child?

17:26.770 --> 17:29.098
I have not done.
- You said no
was no Tooth fairy.

17:29.133 --> 17:30.340
Exactly.
- You're lying.

17:30.341 --> 17:32.928
Sorry.
- It's a start.

17:32.929 --> 17:36.240
Being a fee must
get ready.

17:36.241 --> 17:39.306
But ...

17:42.474 --> 17:47.263
There is a pill.
A large pill.
If you take the pill ...

17:47.264 --> 17:51.120
None of those things you do.
- Really?

17:51.121 --> 17:54.865
No, but I joke.
I gave you something and
weather stripped.

17:54.866 --> 17:56.639
'M Just mad at me.
I do not care.

17:56.736 --> 17:58.631
Walking with Jerry.

17:58.632 --> 18:02.662
Here's your belt.
Waterproof, many boxes.

18:02.696 --> 18:05.132
You get in much.

18:05.133 --> 18:07.447
This.

18:07.562 --> 18:10.461
This is your wand.
A 'switch detector
radiocommunications.

18:10.462 --> 18:13.088
The radio remains Galient pick.
No idea why.

18:13.146 --> 18:14.922
What is it?
- Magic key generator.

18:14.923 --> 18:18.621
It does what you want, but
you must believe it.

18:18.718 --> 18:20.438
So it is useless for people.

18:20.439 --> 18:22.747
And this.

18:22.748 --> 18:25.546
This means you never lose.
- What is it?

18:25.547 --> 18:28.524
It looks like an iPod adapter.
- What is it?

18:28.525 --> 18:31.540
IPod adapter.
- What is it?

18:31.575 --> 18:37.457
Listen to your iPod.
Before you charge your iPod?

18:37.458 --> 18:39.274
No. Really?
- But I joke.

18:39.275 --> 18:43.319
Why do you do it.
- I am sick, I
not live long.

18:43.320 --> 18:45.483
Are you serious?
- Of course not.

18:45.484 --> 18:48.374
I knew you, why would I say?
And you lie to children.

18:48.375 --> 18:50.781
We have work to do.

18:51.620 --> 18:55.118
Spray invisibility.
Feen only other show you.

18:55.119 --> 18:58.608
And, trust me dude ...

18:59.087 --> 19:03.607
paste shrinkage.
Do something on your tongue and you
shrinks to ten inches high.

19:04.142 --> 19:09.338
Would you do it? Together, come on.
We jump into
each other's hands.

19:09.339 --> 19:12.916
I would not jump into your hand.
- Let us be small.

19:13.014 --> 19:17.987
Sometimes when I get home
I double portion ...

19:17.988 --> 19:22.550
my feet dangling over inkwell.
When she sleeps, I go
over her body ...

19:22.551 --> 19:24.467
when she wakes his
footprints everywhere.

19:24.468 --> 19:26.732
She says what is it?
I have no idea.

19:26.766 --> 19:30.395
As long as you are married,
you do such things.

19:30.574 --> 19:34.933
Let's see what else.
A cookie? Selfmade.

19:34.934 --> 19:37.612
Taste it, come on. Very good.

19:38.753 --> 19:41.488
Come test them.

19:42.429 --> 19:45.193
They are very good.

19:45.194 --> 19:47.762
They are good ...

19:51.082 --> 19:53.572
Dogs bark, very handy.
- What?

19:53.672 --> 19:55.455
Cats, postmen, dogs or ...

19:55.490 --> 19:58.181
If a child comes after
you have lied to us.

19:58.281 --> 20:00.942
How often should I apologize?
- Six times.

20:04.933 --> 20:10.662
Sorry, sorry, sorry ...
- Sorry, but I joke.

20:10.750 --> 20:14.929
As you think.
Have you played years without a helmet
or something?

20:14.930 --> 20:19.032
Your brain looks like pudding.
And you have shark eyes.

20:19.132 --> 20:23.063
Like death.

20:23.325 --> 20:27.351
Katverdwijner, very important
If you are not katpersoon.

20:27.352 --> 20:30.640
I have something wonderful.

20:30.641 --> 20:32.990
Not moving.

20:35.755 --> 20:38.192
My greatest invention
ever.

20:38.748 --> 20:43.714
Powder memory.
You throw some and the child forgets
the last 2 seconds.

20:43.715 --> 20:45.157
Of course, come on.

20:45.158 --> 20:46.668
How it works.
- What works?

20:46.768 --> 20:50.989
Powder memory.
You throw some and the child forgets
the last 2 seconds.

20:51.068 --> 20:52.942
How it works.
- What works?

20:53.042 --> 20:56.910
Powder memory.
You throw some and the child forgets
the last 2 seconds.

20:57.010 --> 20:59.356
How it works.
- What works?

20:59.456 --> 21:00.941
Never boring.

21:01.003 --> 21:04.726
The flight, you might think.
You must learn to use your wings.

21:04.727 --> 21:07.161
Do you know how ridiculous you sound.

21:07.195 --> 21:09.285
Who is your hobbit friend over there?

21:09.885 --> 21:14.041
You stay here, OK.
You must learn from the best.

21:14.042 --> 21:18.062
No label them as
best dude.

21:18.063 --> 21:23.920
And I will not fly.
I have a bad down
blade hockey.

21:24.554 --> 21:27.717
The excuse I've ever heard.
- We do it.

21:27.718 --> 21:31.502
Temporary He-man and Peterpan.
- Let me start.

21:31.503 --> 21:36.392
Is that your motivation secrets fairy?
I said I have
a bad wing.

21:38.317 --> 21:40.807
Put me down!
- Great, h.

21:41.198 --> 21:43.865
I appreciate it harder.
- Put me down.

21:45.504 --> 21:49.095
We can test the VOA.

21:49.096 --> 21:51.907
What is it?

21:51.908 --> 21:54.292
Vliegen, obstruction, Removal.

21:54.518 --> 21:57.424
I throw you something and
deftly avoided.

21:57.458 --> 21:59.639
You should not do.

22:00.137 --> 22:02.746
Do you want to throw one?

22:03.318 --> 22:06.655
You do not take your responsibility
and your evading them.

22:07.449 --> 22:09.937
Come on!
- Wimbledon!

22:12.122 --> 22:14.200
It is low.

22:15.595 --> 22:19.026
Light your arm and repeat myself.
... I enter your name.

22:22.687 --> 22:26.327
I, ... Derek Thompson
- Swear approval
and performance ...

22:26.427 --> 22:28.391
Swear approval
and performance ...

22:28.491 --> 22:34.730
accountability and commitment ...

22:34.830 --> 22:36.921
of a tooth fairy.

22:37.700 --> 22:41.605
of ... a tooth fairy.

22:46.352 --> 22:49.163
of a tooth.
- And I do not drink and fly.

22:49.620 --> 22:51.947
Do not drink and fly?

22:51.948 --> 22:54.317
Ok, it is sincere.

22:54.969 --> 22:59.185
I will not drink and fly.
- Welcome aboard.

22:59.186 --> 23:03.249
These are useful in the shop.
- Maybe for a sticker.

23:04.260 --> 23:09.950
It really is fairy.
- Too late, your punishment
starts tomorrow.

23:09.985 --> 23:12.035
No, no.

23:12.044 --> 23:15.312
This delay must be
identical, since his work Jerry.

23:15.347 --> 23:19.249
I can do very well.
My coach is sitting on
my neck and ...

23:19.346 --> 23:21.466
I must make it up
with my girlfriend.

23:25.679 --> 23:31.159
I pause again. Sorry.
- Any task that you
missed an extra week.

23:31.160 --> 23:35.574
If you fail, or anyone else says
you a tooth fairy tales are ...

23:35.575 --> 23:38.516
The time is extended indefinitely.
- I'm not leaving.

23:38.551 --> 23:41.741
Goodbye, Mr. Thompson.
- No.

24:02.337 --> 24:04.923
Sorry.

24:04.924 --> 24:07.361
Why?

24:08.344 --> 24:10.787
As I said last night.

24:10.788 --> 24:13.699
Which part?

24:14.458 --> 24:18.159
Every part that I
have offended you.

24:18.438 --> 24:22.373
For everything I ever said.
If I believed.

24:22.374 --> 24:25.796
Even before I met you.

24:37.224 --> 24:40.610
Would you like to come.
- Oh yes.

24:40.611 --> 24:44.041
Spend some time with Randy alone.

24:46.660 --> 24:50.841
Yes. Let me get something
out of my car.

24:51.008 --> 24:53.065
I'll be back.

24:53.066 --> 24:55.783
Me and Randy.

25:13.583 --> 25:16.369
I never knew you could.
- What do you want?

25:16.370 --> 25:20.227
A gift, you can guess what it is?
- Is it a puppy?

25:20.228 --> 25:24.502
Wag, no puppy.
And from my hockey sticks.

25:25.370 --> 25:28.679
And once I have signed ...

25:28.680 --> 25:31.521
Tooth fairy with ...

25:31.522 --> 25:34.703
is very valuable.

25:36.790 --> 25:39.728
I let it stand here.

25:40.541 --> 25:45.342
You will create many girls with this guitar.
- Stop us now?

25:45.442 --> 25:47.950
You are like the earlier
friends of my mother ...

25:48.050 --> 25:50.213
They pretend they are nice
to impress her.

25:50.313 --> 25:54.877
No, I'm much better looking than
her former boyfriends.

25:55.490 --> 25:58.326
Fist because we broke the ice.

25:59.098 --> 26:02.818
No, it disappears.

26:02.819 --> 26:06.785
Come to my home.
I get my drums up
your guitar and you ...

26:06.786 --> 26:09.481
we play together and jam.

26:09.482 --> 26:12.167
If I tell mother that
you're actually pretty cool ...

26:12.265 --> 26:15.607
and you leave me alone.
- Approved.

26:15.852 --> 26:19.590
You will not believe what
you said about Randy.

26:20.143 --> 26:24.745
You are pretty cool.
- Me too.

26:27.577 --> 26:31.833
Whatever you do, it works.
So keep it filled.

26:38.331 --> 26:41.967
CALL ME, T.

26:42.067 --> 26:45.092
Who is't?
- No idea.

26:45.514 --> 26:50.452
I know that you must close your eyes.
I have a surprise.

26:50.453 --> 26:52.652
Really?

26:52.857 --> 26:56.036
Close your eyes.

26:57.109 --> 27:01.312
My surprise is 1 meter
90, with dark brown eyes?

27:01.412 --> 27:04.425
Then you discover.
- I love surprises.

27:06.001 --> 27:09.211
Be ready.

27:12.339 --> 27:16.027
I know that for me.
- Keep your eyes closed.

27:16.028 --> 27:18.322
Well.

27:20.986 --> 27:23.917
Everything is fine. Do not look.

27:28.705 --> 27:31.776
I needed fresh air.
I am not good.

27:31.777 --> 27:35.419
Shall I come ...
- No, you know what 'pepdel' to me?

27:35.519 --> 27:40.330
Where is it?
- Above, the bathroom.
Far away.

27:40.331 --> 27:43.048
Good Lord.

27:43.049 --> 27:46.400
Hello.
- Who is it?

27:46.401 --> 27:48.059
I agree, Tracy.
- Tracy who?

27:48.159 --> 27:51.776
Tracy, your social worker.
Your first task
is just asleep.

27:51.876 --> 27:55.016
Come quickly to 663 Shelter Coe.

27:55.051 --> 27:57.693
It was still a dream?
- Think again.

27:57.694 --> 28:00.041
No, no.
- Where are you?

28:00.042 --> 28:02.813
In the bushes.
Do not come closer.
You can not see me.

28:02.851 --> 28:06.010
The romantic ruin
your image of me.

28:06.011 --> 28:09.311
You're so sick.

28:09.312 --> 28:12.705
I searched all over the bathroom.
I found nothing.

28:12.706 --> 28:17.162
Look under the sink.
Very far back.

28:17.163 --> 28:19.630
Ok.

28:19.631 --> 28:22.370
You know the rules.
You can not miss the job.

28:22.371 --> 28:25.172
And keep those wings on his back,
until you have that tooth.

28:25.173 --> 28:28.339
You can sometimes clean up!

28:39.335 --> 28:41.680
My wing.

28:48.169 --> 28:51.740
Very well done.
- It really happens.

28:51.741 --> 28:54.345
Go and grab the tooth.

28:54.346 --> 28:57.740
No, I do something. You do it.
- It's not my job.

28:57.741 --> 29:01.093
It succeeds at anything.
You're a fairy.

29:01.094 --> 29:03.814
But without wings.
I am a social worker.

29:03.815 --> 29:05.636
What requires more responsibility.

29:05.670 --> 29:08.031
Register and make
things in envelopes.

29:08.617 --> 29:11.624
So you're not good enough?

29:11.625 --> 29:13.823
They sit behind a desk.
- No, a table.

29:13.824 --> 29:16.120
There is very di
crimination wing.

29:17.030 --> 29:19.462
Very funny.
Slip in and get the tooth.

29:19.562 --> 29:21.771
Maybe I'll improvise.
- How are you doing?

29:21.871 --> 29:25.417
On the wing of a prayer.
- Very funny.
How are you doing?

29:25.517 --> 29:28.045
As a wing of the house mean?
- Will you have one week extra?

29:28.046 --> 29:31.773
No, not even minutes.
What do you suggest?

29:31.926 --> 29:36.555
I can not fly.
- Shrink yourself
and under the door.

29:36.709 --> 29:39.367
Just shrink and slip inside.
... It would make all

29:39.467 --> 29:41.220
in this situation.

29:41.491 --> 29:43.882
shrinkage pasta

29:44.127 --> 29:47.164
Does it hurt?
- Hopefully.

29:48.889 --> 29:56.653
And how much should I back?
- It starts immediately.
Takes an hour.

30:00.346 --> 30:03.242
Unbelievable.

30:03.243 --> 30:05.758
Eat it.
- Shut up.

30:06.290 --> 30:08.914
Your lunch.

30:10.000 --> 30:13.854
Jammie, in Derek's stomach.

30:20.236 --> 30:24.479
Wait!

30:26.110 --> 30:28.620
Now you're not so brave, h?

30:29.814 --> 30:31.026
No, no!

30:31.552 --> 30:34.530
Not so funny, h?

30:34.531 --> 30:37.623
Okay.
- Show me some respect.

30:37.723 --> 30:40.100
I show you some respect back,
when I grow up.

30:40.200 --> 30:42.071
So I save your
spectacles on her nose.

30:42.171 --> 30:45.464
Do not disturb me.
- Is it your best?

30:45.499 --> 30:47.411
Take the money.

30:47.412 --> 30:50.017
Beware, do not throw money.

30:58.561 --> 31:01.192
My Wing ...

31:02.998 --> 31:06.443
Money is hard.

31:56.151 --> 32:00.150
I hate it.
I can not believe ... My wing.

33:53.266 --> 33:56.484
I'm a tooth fairy.

33:59.092 --> 34:01.913
Mama!

34:01.948 --> 34:04.198
We are on track.

34:04.199 --> 34:06.792
Okay?

34:06.793 --> 34:09.416
What's wrong, honey?
- I saw something.

34:09.417 --> 34:12.014
What did you do?
- A little man.

34:15.572 --> 34:18.817
Sweet pussy. Do not hurt me.

34:45.694 --> 34:50.398
I'm the Tooth fairy! Slip! Way!

35:27.849 --> 35:30.921
Derek?
- Carly?

35:31.147 --> 35:34.900
Come cuddle with me.
- No.

35:34.901 --> 35:37.862
I go to bed. Still sick.

35:38.979 --> 35:42.107
I'll call you when I'm older ...
better.

35:42.838 --> 35:44.731
Hello Hockey Supporters, I
is Steve Bewley ...

35:44.732 --> 35:49.403

18-year-old phenomenon ...

35:54.760 --> 35:59.074
Mick Donnelly, who come
into the ice first.

35:59.075 --> 36:02.256
Ready for your game?
- Yes, father, super clear.

36:02.257 --> 36:05.129
S game and I'm still
much higher.

36:05.164 --> 36:08.556
I'm done.
This is my kingdom here.

36:08.557 --> 36:10.282
I am the king.
You do not even Prince.

36:10.283 --> 36:13.481
You are such a little guy
running around the field ...

36:13.482 --> 36:15.487
in a pathetic way.

36:16.672 --> 36:20.298
Mick the stick!

36:47.944 --> 36:51.542
Your throne You are disabled.

36:56.399 --> 36:59.625
This is the last time.

36:59.626 --> 37:01.782
The Ice Wolf face on
Rofnex with two points.

37:01.783 --> 37:04.366
Mick Donnelly has the
hype lost.

37:04.367 --> 37:06.781
He still works
to hattrick.

37:06.782 --> 37:09.372
PUK is back Rofnex ...

37:09.373 --> 37:11.232
and a quick shot.
- Good.

37:11.233 --> 37:13.645
Donnelly captures the PUK.

37:13.646 --> 37:16.948
He has speed.

37:17.965 --> 37:20.517
See him fly.

37:20.518 --> 37:23.803
He goes over and one who he is!

37:23.804 --> 37:26.877
He goes across.

37:27.833 --> 37:31.018
He continues to walk.

37:31.019 --> 37:35.452
He goes around the target.

37:40.710 --> 37:44.252
Donnelly Fri

37:44.580 --> 37:47.217
He seems to shoot.

37:52.997 --> 37:55.944
Barn at 2631 Castle Heights.
- But not now?

38:00.281 --> 38:04.328
What a blow! He is down.

38:04.363 --> 38:10.375
Limback Thompson seemed to stop,
but he falls by himself.

38:18.303 --> 38:21.826
You took me on a hattrick
and interviews ISBN.

38:22.380 --> 38:24.801

38:27.781 --> 38:30.868
What are you doing?

38:30.869 --> 38:32.813
Come here.

38:32.814 --> 38:36.162
I am very busy here, no
pictures at the moment.

38:36.163 --> 38:38.387
Busy.
- Yes, I will wait.

38:39.765 --> 38:42.704
What are you talking about?

38:43.479 --> 38:46.127
What he means?

38:52.986 --> 38:55.567
Come out!
- No, no.

38:55.568 --> 38:57.812
You come out, or
we get inside.

38:58.889 --> 39:02.249
And ...
- Not good.

39:02.250 --> 39:04.084
Two ...

39:05.557 --> 39:07.811
Three!

39:16.214 --> 39:18.659
What happened?
Why is it too late?

39:18.660 --> 39:20.857
Where were you? Why are you wet?
- Do not talk to me.

39:20.858 --> 39:23.196
Silence. I hate this job.

39:23.197 --> 39:26.823
What is that smell?
I can not breathe.

39:30.847 --> 39:32.935
Hello.
- Hello.

39:33.863 --> 39:36.534
What ingods ...
- Hi, Mom.

39:38.947 --> 39:41.223
Where is the child.

39:47.768 --> 39:49.505
Be nice, respectful.
- Nice.

39:49.540 --> 39:51.203
Returning from the toilet,
you think me cares?

39:51.238 --> 39:54.372
Moederfee, here's your tooth.

39:54.373 --> 39:57.672
Do whatever you want with it here
feenwereld in your teeth.

39:57.673 --> 40:02.722
According to your social worker you are not
really grown up with the Tooth fairy spirit.

40:02.723 --> 40:05.570
My social worker says it.
You called her and said that?

40:05.571 --> 40:08.643
My social worker was "jealous wing.
- False.

40:08.644 --> 40:11.322
It's true.
- I'm a big fan of the track.

40:11.323 --> 40:13.591
You hate this job.
- I live there.

40:13.592 --> 40:16.500
Fake. You hate it.
- Will you stop.

40:16.501 --> 40:19.955
See what you've done
to this family.

40:22.059 --> 40:24.908
Who are you?
- Who are you?

40:25.700 --> 40:28.697
I've been home?

40:33.586 --> 40:36.642
It is not funny.
- Did you see that dog?
With those eyes?

40:36.643 --> 40:40.410
You have it covered.
- Moederfee who is your boss?

40:40.411 --> 40:44.743
Who are you? Gandhi? Who should I talk.
I will now lodge a complaint.

40:44.744 --> 40:47.403
You have a second mission.
- Another tooth? Kidding right?

40:47.404 --> 40:48.990
Sometimes a
dual mission.

40:48.991 --> 40:51.426
But tell me where the tooth is
I go and I can go home.

40:51.427 --> 40:55.510
Not until the child falls asleep.
Until then, you wait.

41:06.371 --> 41:09.194
And the child falls asleep in the afternoon
and the other child was up all night.

41:38.406 --> 41:42.328
Delicious tea.
- Sweet tea?

41:42.362 --> 41:44.788
Refreshing.

42:09.625 --> 42:12.289
Do you feel any better?

42:12.290 --> 42:15.268
Yes, but a little. Guys coming up?

42:16.233 --> 42:20.809
Hello, beautiful.
- I need
a great service.

42:20.810 --> 42:23.130
Tess and I got a call
in the last minute ...

42:23.131 --> 42:25.539
Towards a beauty makeover party.

42:25.540 --> 42:28.514
Leuk.
- A beauty makeover party.

42:28.549 --> 42:30.721
And I thought, because you now
come up with, so good ...

42:30.722 --> 42:33.563
or you can live with Randy.

42:41.847 --> 42:43.796
Yes, of course.

42:43.797 --> 42:46.483
Super.
Great. I'm good with you.

42:46.484 --> 42:49.254
Behave. Have fun.

42:51.817 --> 42:53.929
Great.

43:11.662 --> 43:13.916
Hockey is your positive.

43:18.569 --> 43:21.640
Will you stay with me or receive
you a beauty make-over?

43:25.861 --> 43:29.006
Nice stuff, h?
- Whatever.

43:29.007 --> 43:31.560
Pak n alone, and look
how it sounds.

43:31.561 --> 43:34.753
I do not want.
- Here. Try.

43:36.251 --> 43:38.608
Stop, please.
- Try me.
Let's see how it sounds.

43:46.207 --> 43:49.696
It sounds great.
I'm drumming
in the sixth ...

43:49.697 --> 43:53.278
But in the meantime you keep practicing.
This is really great.

44:12.992 --> 44:15.376
What is it?
- It sounds good.

44:15.377 --> 44:17.246
Thank you.

44:17.247 --> 44:20.021
If you play in the talent show?

44:20.022 --> 44:22.861
There you are.
- Why are you talking
with that idiot?

44:22.862 --> 44:25.934
Don 's pocket.
- Your father is waiting. You should go.

44:31.157 --> 44:34.353
Remember not to talk to her.
Roger loses?

44:35.387 --> 44:39.081
Put it away. That sucks.

44:40.283 --> 44:43.818
What to do with Randy's guitar?
- I do not know.

44:43.819 --> 44:46.570
Give this to him.
- Good.

44:48.701 --> 44:51.498
Now get out.

45:01.760 --> 45:04.565
Now you're in trouble.
- That we'll see.

45:04.566 --> 45:07.758
I see. The two couples?

45:07.759 --> 45:10.037
Area, but, and get behind.

45:10.038 --> 45:12.212
Great guy, big guys who
put all his chips.

45:12.213 --> 45:15.425
Me too.
I am not afraid.
Aces of Lords.

45:17.829 --> 45:19.929
Flush.
- No.

45:19.930 --> 45:23.526
Yes. Now look. All mine.

45:23.527 --> 45:26.579
Nice. Do not rub.

45:29.810 --> 45:32.957
May I ask you something?

45:37.571 --> 45:40.310
It is certainly on your
body that is changing?

45:40.345 --> 45:44.962
Anything that happens with your
body is perfectly natural.

45:44.963 --> 45:48.779
No. Stop talking.

45:48.780 --> 45:51.114
Stop talking.

45:51.115 --> 45:54.885
I did not ask.

45:54.886 --> 45:57.519
Not so.
- Good.

45:57.520 --> 45:59.866
Promise not to talk
about puberty.

46:03.220 --> 46:05.824
Thank goodness.

46:05.825 --> 46:08.352
Believe me, I will not
talk about it.

46:09.829 --> 46:12.185
Whats up. Seriously.

46:13.494 --> 46:16.520
At school we have a talented ...

46:18.456 --> 46:21.810
Mom, I think to make them
and I am a bit ...

46:23.074 --> 46:25.536
I do not know.

46:26.071 --> 46:28.754
You may want to participate.
- Yes?

46:28.755 --> 46:32.044
Yes, you are wonderful.
I hear you play.

46:32.045 --> 46:34.512
You are really good.

46:34.982 --> 46:37.595
And the girls who love
guitarists.

46:38.124 --> 46:41.309
We're back.
- We are here.

46:41.310 --> 46:43.806
But nothing to tell your mother.

46:45.710 --> 46:47.824
Hey, guys. How did it go?

46:47.825 --> 46:49.571
Your son is just wrong.
- False.

46:49.572 --> 46:53.593
He certainly does not. ... And you see
- Beautiful.

46:54.151 --> 46:56.814
You get the words out of
my mouth.

46:56.815 --> 46:59.374
Are you hungry?
Shall we go get something to eat?

46:59.375 --> 47:01.478
Please.

47:03.457 --> 47:05.701
Where is your coat?

47:10.000 --> 47:12.614
You have to go?
- Is anybody hurt?

47:12.615 --> 47:14.715
Not like that you know that you
likes to do.

47:14.716 --> 47:17.711
You both look beautiful.
I'll call you later.
I'm really sorry.

47:19.838 --> 47:21.930
Shrink pasta.
No, not again.

47:21.963 --> 47:23.733
Amnesia dust.
- No.

47:23.734 --> 47:26.889
Flying? Poor wing. Forget it.

47:26.890 --> 47:31.537
Moreover, your "all targets magic key
generator ", which is not.

47:31.538 --> 47:34.338
This is broken.
- This is an idea.

47:34.373 --> 47:37.897
Do not touch my bag.
This is mine. What do you want?

47:37.930 --> 47:40.340
The magical invisibility sprays.

47:40.341 --> 47:43.059
It always works.
- I know.

47:48.835 --> 47:51.386
Spray it everywhere.

47:58.557 --> 48:01.111
What a surprise.
It does not work.

48:01.112 --> 48:03.552
Your stuff sucks.

48:03.969 --> 48:07.715
Leuk.
- It will leave.

48:19.577 --> 48:21.467
Did you hear that?
- Yes.

48:28.608 --> 48:31.235
Are you confused?
Can we help you?

48:31.857 --> 48:34.548
How about some amnesia dust?

48:40.431 --> 48:42.827
Where am I?
- Go to the white light, my friend.

48:42.828 --> 48:45.643
Go to the white light.

48:47.106 --> 48:48.842
Dear Dog.

48:48.843 --> 48:50.943
Do not hurt me, dog.

48:52.821 --> 48:57.376
What is it?
- A nice long story.

48:57.377 --> 48:59.842
Where is the tooth?

48:59.843 --> 49:02.081
Can I get help?

49:03.404 --> 49:05.946
That's it.

49:09.473 --> 49:12.785
You could very well be the
Tooth fairy worst ever.

49:12.786 --> 49:15.063
Besides, I need some things.
- Stuff?

49:15.064 --> 49:18.237
Things.
The magic powder.
Stuff. Q. Tell

49:18.238 --> 49:21.282
No more things.
- It's amazing.

49:21.283 --> 49:23.560
Although half weeks of my
job, how do I do?

49:23.561 --> 49:25.670
Sorry, we have
very little money.

49:25.705 --> 49:28.686
Want to know why?
- Not really.

49:29.393 --> 49:32.436
Because children are no longer
faith, as they did.

49:33.539 --> 49:37.626
We are not alone.
Even unicorns,
leprechauns, dragons.

49:37.627 --> 49:40.583
All these departments. All gone.

49:40.584 --> 49:44.986
If this trend continues,
no longer tandfeenland.

49:45.082 --> 49:49.411
No child will still receive
more visits from the Tooth fairy.

49:49.511 --> 49:52.381
Ever.
- No visits from the Tooth fairy.

49:52.481 --> 49:55.080
So what?

49:55.081 --> 49:58.070
You really do not understand.

49:58.071 --> 50:01.467
You do not understand that fantasies
for children ...

50:01.468 --> 50:04.414
their ability to imagine
something that is important?

50:04.415 --> 50:07.149
Thus ignoring their souls.

50:07.150 --> 50:09.834
It is the foundation that gives
them to dream.

50:09.868 --> 50:12.543
Dreams are bad.

50:12.544 --> 50:14.765
Useless.

50:16.216 --> 50:18.388
You're done.
- The whole week?

50:18.389 --> 50:22.179
For tonight.
Unless you want to
remain "Fairioke.

50:22.214 --> 50:24.644
Oh. No

50:25.986 --> 50:29.228
"Fairioke" Feen for karaoke?

50:37.548 --> 50:39.659
I have the thing for you.

50:41.643 --> 50:45.337
What is it?
- The thing. Package.

50:45.338 --> 50:47.771
Bag. Bomb. The stuff.

50:48.994 --> 50:51.970
Frisco special.
Pink Lady. Little Drummer Boy.

50:51.971 --> 50:53.611
Who are you?
- Ziggy.

50:53.612 --> 50:56.851
Say what you will.
Zigman, Zigmeister ...

50:56.852 --> 50:58.870
Stop talking.
- They want you
to fail.

51:00.531 --> 51:02.254
What?
- Think about it.

51:02.255 --> 51:05.656
If you fail, they get more time.
It's like k
editkort debt ...

51:05.657 --> 51:08.017
they just want you
pay forever.

51:09.332 --> 51:11.691
Yes.
- Do you really think
to play games?

51:14.204 --> 51:16.247
$ 1000
- $ 1000?

51:16.300 --> 51:18.572
You kill me.
- How do you like that ending?

51:21.902 --> 51:24.171
Can I check?

51:31.759 --> 51:34.065
Oh no.

51:35.781 --> 51:38.359
Can you see me?

51:38.776 --> 51:42.152
This does not work.
- What is it?

51:43.401 --> 51:45.609
What are you doing?

51:56.559 --> 51:59.444
What Ziggy has given me?

52:01.759 --> 52:05.803
Stay calm.
- 112?

52:05.804 --> 52:08.323
I just need the tooth.
- There is an alien
on my balcony.

52:18.057 --> 52:20.194
You are fantastic.

52:20.195 --> 52:23.413
Lily is so pissed because they had
a fee to post your trade fairs.

52:23.414 --> 52:26.910
I've learned my lesson.
Never buy black market stuff.

52:26.911 --> 52:30.056
I can not even 2 weeks continue.
- Yes, you can be friend.

52:30.509 --> 52:34.187
Just make a bigger impact.
One day while taking it.

52:35.006 --> 52:39.051
Social workers decide who
can see us and who is not.

52:39.052 --> 52:42.554
They wanted to know if you have ever given attention
to me, or would listen to me.

52:42.555 --> 52:45.790
But no.

52:45.791 --> 52:47.993
Shut up.
- Ven ...

52:47.994 --> 52:50.126
You should really take the renovation.

52:50.127 --> 52:55.203
If you want I can give you a pamphlet.
- Your punishment is also enlarged.

52:55.204 --> 52:57.068
You need a week. Well done.

52:57.069 --> 53:00.801
Great. Just what I need.
- I think you have
need it, friend.

53:01.300 --> 53:03.893
I can now give the new equipment.

53:03.894 --> 53:08.386
I n mode.
From now on, follow the rules.
You embrace the spirit of fairy.

53:08.420 --> 53:13.154
And then listen again.
- Good.
I will always be
the best tooth.

53:16.341 --> 53:19.356
You always draw you back
from me and then ...

53:19.357 --> 53:22.539
you never call.
And when I finally fall
something from you ...

53:22.540 --> 53:25.435
is that your deposit
to pay.

53:25.470 --> 53:28.331
What happened to you?

53:28.332 --> 53:31.925
I would like to tell
you, but I can not.

53:31.926 --> 53:34.522
Why not?

53:35.355 --> 53:38.164
I just can not.

53:39.362 --> 53:42.139
I know what it is.
It is that you prefer.

53:42.140 --> 53:45.632
You are afraid of a commitment to go.
You are nervous because
it seriously.

53:46.821 --> 53:50.389
Yes, that's it.
You know me so well.

53:50.390 --> 53:53.200
I am nervous about how serious it is.
- What?

53:59.623 --> 54:03.470
You are a woman, and quite frankly,
you would not understand.

54:03.505 --> 54:05.321
What?

54:09.151 --> 54:14.428
I'm not nervous, because it is between us seriously.
I must not even think.

54:14.429 --> 54:16.407
What?

54:19.860 --> 54:24.320
I was a little sad.
And I love you so much.

54:24.321 --> 54:28.060
I'm afraid to spoil
and lose weight.

54:32.453 --> 54:36.889
I understand.
I am so happy to
you re doing well.

54:36.890 --> 54:40.430
Can I get any of it?

54:40.431 --> 54:44.360
What are you doing? Have you already started training?
- I come.

54:44.361 --> 54:45.948
Hurry.

54:45.949 --> 54:48.941
It is for me stood, flushed,
beaten and arrested.

54:48.942 --> 54:52.446
Stop complaining.
They promised to embrace
the feengeest.

54:52.447 --> 54:55.486
I really include feengeest.

54:55.487 --> 54:58.717
But I do it ...

55:00.771 --> 55:03.817
on my way.

55:03.818 --> 55:07.276
It is outside the rules.
- Yes.

55:40.878 --> 55:43.232
I'm just here for a tooth.

55:43.233 --> 55:45.395
Only tooth.

55:46.219 --> 55:49.005
I take my glove.

55:51.292 --> 55:53.364
Good.

55:54.144 --> 55:57.300
Now enter the tooth. Easy.

55:59.342 --> 56:03.035
Let it go.

56:03.603 --> 56:06.249
I said, 'let loose'.

56:06.250 --> 56:08.811
Very good.

56:09.225 --> 56:11.851
Good evening.

56:20.153 --> 56:23.000
Who are you?

56:23.001 --> 56:26.206
I'm the tooth fairy.

56:26.207 --> 56:28.732
Yes.

56:34.327 --> 56:35.763
Okay? Ok.

56:35.764 --> 56:38.045
Mick, how you doing
So far with you?

56:38.080 --> 56:41.218
I'm the new player and ...

56:41.253 --> 56:44.143
some teeth from the Wolfs are long,
if you understand me.

56:44.178 --> 56:48.994
This reference, Derek Thompson,
the Tooth Fairy?

56:49.187 --> 56:51.714
No, I respect
my parents.

56:51.749 --> 56:54.976
Thompson takes you beneath your wings?
- No, its wings are bad ...

56:54.977 --> 56:58.058
mine is new and ready to fly.
I want my own thing.

56:58.093 --> 57:01.432
A secure young player, good luck.
- Thanks.

57:01.467 --> 57:05.040
The Ice Wolf makes them simple.

57:05.041 --> 57:06.640
Mick, you are.
- Finally.

57:07.064 --> 57:08.783
Good luck, kid.

57:08.883 --> 57:12.824
I mean it.
I think you are doing great.
You are the best hockey
player ever.

57:13.171 --> 57:16.788
Whatever.

57:16.789 --> 57:18.652
Come on.

57:18.712 --> 57:22.732
Donnelly, ending the game,
and go straight past.

57:22.733 --> 57:24.782
The Ice Wolf pass
the blue line.

57:24.783 --> 57:30.256
Haig is on the web.
These two rivals go some
battles with each other.

57:50.508 --> 57:52.504
Here we go.

57:53.572 --> 57:56.502
PUK is in the corner.
Donnelly goes after him.

57:56.503 --> 58:00.370
What happened to Donnelly, Jim?
- What are you doing?

58:02.690 --> 58:07.949
PUK is extracted from Donnelly
and picks it up.

58:07.950 --> 58:10.893
Save him!

58:11.449 --> 58:14.496
He is terrible.
What happened, Jim?

58:14.497 --> 58:16.352
Has anyone found him, Jim?

58:16.353 --> 58:19.132
What's going on?

58:27.688 --> 58:29.752
He laughs?

58:36.130 --> 58:37.945
Is everything okay?

58:38.378 --> 58:40.672
What?

58:40.707 --> 58:43.342
Try to test me?
- Get off the ice.

58:43.343 --> 58:46.213
If you want to play games
but you go on the bench.

58:46.214 --> 58:48.296
But on Thursday. Hurry.

58:54.678 --> 58:57.037
What did I miss?

59:01.664 --> 59:03.999
Why do you bark?

59:14.263 --> 59:17.158
I do not know.
I blew it right now.

59:17.759 --> 59:19.965
It's okay.
We must continue
practice.

59:19.966 --> 59:22.644
Everyone will laugh at me.
Maybe I should not do.

59:22.645 --> 59:25.921
Maybe they do, or ...

59:25.922 --> 59:28.589
you can blow taken out.

59:32.659 --> 59:35.419
You can not score if
you do not shoot.

59:35.420 --> 59:38.400
Yes? When did you last shot?

59:43.232 --> 59:47.265
When I started, I
was a goal scorer.

59:47.266 --> 59:50.113
First Round, 'The Devils' ass.
In 'The Bigs' game.

59:50.210 --> 59:53.133
What happened?
- I broke my
shoulder in Chicago.

59:53.134 --> 59:56.136
They have put me in a lower class to
to recover, and it lasted forever.

59:56.437 --> 01:00:00.724
I was so angry and frustrated that I am a night
a person from New Heaven took to grazing.

01:00:00.934 --> 01:00:03.628
Hit a couple of his teeth out
the audience was crazy ...

01:00:03.629 --> 01:00:06.122
and when they called me
'the tooth fairy.

01:00:06.123 --> 01:00:08.344
And it was with me.

01:00:09.616 --> 01:00:12.262
And I have not scored for years.

01:00:16.221 --> 01:00:20.717
But I have more penalty minutes
than anyone else in the league.

01:00:20.718 --> 01:00:23.551
If you are not completely
healed or shoulder?

01:00:23.552 --> 01:00:27.433
It is not the same.
- How do you know?

01:00:27.434 --> 01:00:30.200
You try not agree.

01:00:30.201 --> 01:00:33.342
You can not score if
you do not shoot.

01:00:36.186 --> 01:00:39.061
If you do, will
I do it.

01:00:45.089 --> 01:00:47.929
Well adopted.

01:00:54.844 --> 01:00:57.377
And a tooth.

01:01:03.786 --> 01:01:07.691
It must have been a good
time when you handed the tooth.

01:01:07.692 --> 01:01:13.245
I genteresseerd how it feels.
- Find it out yourself.

01:01:13.279 --> 01:01:15.341
I'm not a fairy with wings.

01:01:15.342 --> 01:01:17.572
Put it out again.
Why can not you have wings?

01:01:17.573 --> 01:01:21.005
Want to know something about evolution fairy?
Who wrote it?

01:01:21.006 --> 01:01:23.300
"Charles Darwing?

01:01:23.700 --> 01:01:28.567
Developments Feen Feen cultivate some
wings, and some do not.

01:01:28.568 --> 01:01:32.738
I am one of the unfortunate.
- Tooth fairy if you
not have wings.

01:01:33.704 --> 01:01:37.648
You have it all.
- It's true.

01:01:37.649 --> 01:01:40.014
You must show them your power.

01:01:40.015 --> 01:01:41.864
Speed, masculinity,
flexibility.

01:01:42.958 --> 01:01:45.847
How do I do?

01:01:45.848 --> 01:01:49.367
To peasants around.

01:01:56.334 --> 01:01:58.662
No, come back.

01:02:01.412 --> 01:02:03.318
Where are you going?
- Check that door again.

01:02:03.353 --> 01:02:05.426
It is almost one meter high, you
is nearly 2 meters long ...

01:02:05.427 --> 01:02:07.415
go back.

01:02:10.939 --> 01:02:14.268
A dinosaur!
- No.

01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:26.345
Again, I am.
- Is everything okay?

01:02:32.010 --> 01:02:33.731
Why save the child?

01:02:33.831 --> 01:02:36.524
Back to my roots, it
is my worst nightmare.

01:02:43.482 --> 01:02:46.045
The success of all

01:02:53.353 --> 01:02:57.819
You look like a reindeer so beautiful with your legs.
You dance.

01:02:59.630 --> 01:03:04.261
Not with the child in themselves.
Amnesia Powder.

01:03:33.864 --> 01:03:36.675
It sounded good.
You make them away tomorrow.

01:03:36.676 --> 01:03:39.339
What do you think?

01:03:44.850 --> 01:03:48.893
Nice. Great. Randy Harris.

01:03:48.894 --> 01:03:51.127
Talent Show.
I think the thing is fun.

01:03:51.223 --> 01:03:55.974
You think I can be a famous rock star.
Like Clapton, Hendrix,
or Stevie revons?

01:03:56.637 --> 01:03:58.964
Fair?
- Yes.

01:04:01.588 --> 01:04:03.727
You're pretty good.

01:04:03.728 --> 01:04:06.340
Let's say that you work very
hard to continue.

01:04:06.375 --> 01:04:10.059
Let's say you 13jarige the best
guitarist in the neighborhood is.

01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:14.081
It is so.
You should know that there
Many neighborhoods.

01:04:14.082 --> 01:04:17.669
And a lot 13jarige guitarists, but
somewhere out there a 12jarige ...

01:04:17.670 --> 01:04:19.803
that kill guitar.

01:04:27.949 --> 01:04:31.933
You know what? Yes, it is possible.

01:04:35.389 --> 01:04:37.663
Take them to graze.

01:04:37.664 --> 01:04:41.655
In the third half of the match
was the Arrows ... 43

01:04:41.656 --> 01:04:44.701
and this is yet another
great game.

01:04:44.702 --> 01:04:48.968
The arrows face and get away.

01:04:49.003 --> 01:04:52.350
You're back.
- Do you clean your pants on?

01:04:52.351 --> 01:04:55.197
It's okay.
You want them to wonder.

01:04:55.730 --> 01:04:59.421
The Ice Wolf pushed the PUK on Arrow's
half, and the Lion is chasing.

01:04:59.422 --> 01:05:02.210
The coach leaves Donnelly
back to the game.

01:05:03.229 --> 01:05:06.944
Now they've got the puck
behind the blue line.

01:05:10.607 --> 01:05:13.751
And here comes the bank of Thompson,
and replaces Dobs.

01:05:20.763 --> 01:05:25.520
Thompson fits Browley
and takes him over.

01:05:25.521 --> 01:05:29.365
Thompson goes back into the game
while Donnelly is on the side.

01:05:29.366 --> 01:05:34.242
Thompson takes the puck with his stick,
and Donnelly is with him.

01:05:34.243 --> 01:05:38.186
It is against two n with Thompson
take the lead.

01:05:38.187 --> 01:05:41.892
Donnelly shouted that he
would give off.

01:05:45.867 --> 01:05:50.258
Thompson appears to
fit, he makes the pass,

01:05:50.259 --> 01:05:54.668
He has left wide open
goals, the goal is open.

01:06:03.866 --> 01:06:06.563
What can he do?

01:06:09.334 --> 01:06:14.174
The arrows are on the ice, the
shoot and score.

01:06:15.804 --> 01:06:20.159
Jim, it appeared Thompson would
Just shoot, and he suffocated.

01:06:34.526 --> 01:06:37.625
You're not a hockey player, but
An example statement attraction.

01:06:39.053 --> 01:06:42.574
Look at the game tomorrow
from the bank.

01:06:42.575 --> 01:06:45.567
Asshole.

01:06:45.568 --> 01:06:48.090
Come on, guys.

01:06:54.310 --> 01:06:57.282
Great.

01:07:06.889 --> 01:07:09.061
How was your race?

01:07:09.062 --> 01:07:12.531
Not good.
- Dad, I have a loose tooth.

01:07:12.532 --> 01:07:14.835
Great, baby.
- What?

01:07:14.836 --> 01:07:18.728
Everything. Nothing. Forget it.
- Can we go practice?

01:07:18.761 --> 01:07:22.262
Can we skip the lesson today.
I tried just did not.

01:07:22.263 --> 01:07:24.333
Talent show is tomorrow.
- I can you.

01:07:24.334 --> 01:07:26.687
I should have at least n times through.
- You do not.

01:07:26.688 --> 01:07:30.475
I did need.
I need some more
practice, so I can win.

01:07:30.476 --> 01:07:32.716
No matter what you do
the talent show ...

01:07:32.717 --> 01:07:36.230
You will never be a famous rock star.
Only one other child with a guitar.

01:07:36.231 --> 01:07:40.738
Do yourself a favor and give up.
It is for his own good.
Believe me.

01:07:52.079 --> 01:07:56.319
Come on, Tess.
- What happened to you?

01:07:56.320 --> 01:07:57.999
I had a bad day?
- A bad day?

01:07:58.099 --> 01:08:01.019
A bad day, huh?
- No, it is not good.

01:08:01.119 --> 01:08:03.969
You never talk with my children.

01:08:04.004 --> 01:08:05.980
It's over between us.

01:08:07.785 --> 01:08:12.067
You know what your problem is?
You can not say
'what if'.

01:08:14.971 --> 01:08:17.587
And it never will be.

01:08:48.256 --> 01:08:52.524
Who wants to hear good news? In.
Come on.

01:08:54.441 --> 01:08:56.939
Why are you here?
- Lily has given me this.

01:08:59.491 --> 01:09:01.738
Feen Teachers Proof.
- It is only a proof
but I am on the road.

01:09:01.738 --> 01:09:04.296
You should now be on the way home,
because I go to bed.

01:09:04.298 --> 01:09:06.600
This is due to you.
We must celebrate.

01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:08.871
I know a place where
all good mothers are fairy.

01:09:08.872 --> 01:09:12.443
Are you crazy?
I just lost everything
means something to me.

01:09:12.444 --> 01:09:14.341
My friend, children ...

01:09:14.343 --> 01:09:16.288
and I probably have my skates
for good on willows hung.

01:09:16.290 --> 01:09:19.249
Just because I like an idiot
the Tooth fairy crap you think.

01:09:19.283 --> 01:09:21.743
And see what it has brought me.

01:09:22.696 --> 01:09:26.438
You do n trial after all these years,
it will not work and then simply pass?

01:09:26.439 --> 01:09:30.518
So it would not be easy.
And you know it.

01:09:31.975 --> 01:09:37.063
I will tell you what I know.
I know you do not have wings.

01:09:37.424 --> 01:09:40.834
This means that you
can not fly.

01:09:40.835 --> 01:09:45.594
This also means that one never
may be a tooth fairy.

01:09:45.595 --> 01:09:48.011
And what happens if you have a ten-storey
building to flee?

01:09:48.112 --> 01:09:52.794
I will tell you.
Plat! So.

01:09:59.975 --> 01:10:02.240
You know what really sad?

01:10:02.241 --> 01:10:05.013
The person who makes you most all
your dreams is not murder ...

01:10:05.014 --> 01:10:09.055
Carly or randy, or
I find it yourself.

01:10:10.974 --> 01:10:14.447
Go away. Well.

01:10:17.325 --> 01:10:19.455
Fine.

01:10:19.456 --> 01:10:21.966
I go to bed.

01:10:21.967 --> 01:10:24.442
A 24 minute sets
the third time.

01:10:24.443 --> 01:10:26.936
The Ice Wolf still 1 to 0

01:10:26.970 --> 01:10:30.871
And Derek Thompson is still
trainer in his dug-out.

01:10:30.872 --> 01:10:33.383
I think that whole game has
he has not seen the ice.

01:10:33.384 --> 01:10:35.800
Come on.
- When the game goes ...

01:10:35.801 --> 01:10:40.212
Andreas Patrinkle replace the newcomer,
Thompson continues.

01:10:41.915 --> 01:10:44.225
What is this?

01:10:44.226 --> 01:10:46.378
Another blow.

01:10:46.379 --> 01:10:49.775
Donnelly picked up along the PUK.
He goes across.

01:10:49.776 --> 01:10:52.566
He has plans
to return.

01:10:55.106 --> 01:10:59.618
Donnelly makes every
Motion is just good.

01:10:59.619 --> 01:11:04.587
Donnelly will be to go and almost get
out of position and Donnelly goes along.

01:11:04.588 --> 01:11:07.716
He will shoot. And he ...

01:11:07.717 --> 01:11:10.635
Against the bar.

01:11:11.368 --> 01:11:13.091
Rick, what happened?
He blew his whistle.

01:11:13.092 --> 01:11:18.106
Offscreen Patrinkle were killed,
and I think he does not stop.

01:11:26.471 --> 01:11:30.419
Thompson, go there.

01:11:30.909 --> 01:11:33.076
Go.

01:11:42.409 --> 01:11:45.195
Come on, guys.
- The Ice Wolf 1 minute ...

01:11:46.112 --> 01:11:47.515
to score, or an extension.

01:11:48.620 --> 01:11:51.483
Thompson looks at the clock.

01:11:51.484 --> 01:11:54.555
And they start to hunt,
when the clock counts down.

01:11:54.556 --> 01:11:57.931
It seems that Thompson
take part because he must.

01:11:59.822 --> 01:12:02.216
Thompson got a shot.

01:12:02.217 --> 01:12:05.458
How can there be no punishment?
He was beaten mess.

01:12:09.494 --> 01:12:12.569
I think the Tooth fairy was a
payback.

01:13:20.748 --> 01:13:22.688
Look for Thompson, Jim.

01:13:22.689 --> 01:13:25.386
His legs seem to get
back on track.

01:13:25.387 --> 01:13:28.856
Thompson flies over the ice, and
I can not make friends.

01:13:28.857 --> 01:13:31.344
This is gonna hurt.

01:13:31.345 --> 01:13:36.557
No, he thought he not hit.
Unbelievable.

01:13:36.558 --> 01:13:38.920
He takes the puck out and
flying over the ice.

01:13:39.768 --> 01:13:45.065
Thompson makes movements
we have not seen.

01:13:45.066 --> 01:13:47.622
Who is that guy.

01:13:47.623 --> 01:13:50.011
He is only through the n defender.

01:13:50.985 --> 01:13:54.482
He becomes the defender,
I think he will decrease.

01:13:54.517 --> 01:13:57.980
No, he stops, see
what the guy leaves.

01:14:00.044 --> 01:14:02.583
He shoots.

01:14:25.721 --> 01:14:28.820
Derek Thompson has been
nine years not shot ...

01:14:28.821 --> 01:14:32.676
and so a great shot I've ever seen.
With my arm.

01:14:33.134 --> 01:14:36.886
Tommy Mayor Would Shock
we do it again.

01:14:40.502 --> 01:14:43.252
Not bad.

01:14:49.742 --> 01:14:52.022
Great shot, dude.

01:14:56.719 --> 01:14:58.342
Here we go.

01:14:58.343 --> 01:15:02.736
Even 20 seconds, while both
teams go to the center spot.

01:15:09.787 --> 01:15:11.875
Oh, no.

01:15:15.819 --> 01:15:19.320
The Ice Wolf, the puck, and
a pass to Thompson ...

01:15:19.321 --> 01:15:21.678
Who give away.
- Why would he
do it, Nick?

01:15:21.679 --> 01:15:24.566
I have no idea, Jim.
- I can not abandon them.

01:15:24.567 --> 01:15:27.281
This is my last chance
to play the game.

01:15:27.282 --> 01:15:31.469
To leave when I arrived.
- From what I have
viewed, you earn it.

01:15:31.470 --> 01:15:33.569
Thompson, what are you doing?

01:15:33.570 --> 01:15:36.578
Are you not a student?
You break the rules or not?

01:15:36.579 --> 01:15:40.253
Please, I have learned from the best.
Look here first to solve ...

01:15:40.254 --> 01:15:42.438
Before he takes
its decision.

01:15:48.630 --> 01:15:52.559
This is Carly's house.
- 14, come on.

01:15:52.560 --> 01:15:55.047
Thompson, go back in the box.

01:15:55.048 --> 01:15:57.474
I can walk. Lily does not know.

01:15:57.475 --> 01:15:59.809
But I want to know.

01:16:00.299 --> 01:16:03.119
I need this
for home care.

01:16:24.003 --> 01:16:26.750
Let us do it.
- How? You can not fly?

01:16:26.785 --> 01:16:29.561
Good time to learn.

01:16:29.562 --> 01:16:32.670
Yes it is.

01:16:39.763 --> 01:16:42.141
Take them to graze.

01:16:49.915 --> 01:16:52.280
If you want to fly,
you must believe.

01:17:50.180 --> 01:17:52.941
No panic, but it is a
huge memory gun.

01:17:53.314 --> 01:17:55.603
It does not hurt and you
feel nothing.

01:17:59.798 --> 01:18:03.205
Remember me.

01:18:03.206 --> 01:18:05.584
That you do.

01:18:06.046 --> 01:18:08.474
Good luck with your car find.

01:18:36.711 --> 01:18:39.512
Hi, honey.
- Hi, Derek.

01:18:40.982 --> 01:18:43.052
You have a nice costume.

01:18:44.694 --> 01:18:46.876
I must tell you something.

01:18:47.825 --> 01:18:52.911
I was wrong, it
Tooth fairy is real.

01:18:53.004 --> 01:18:54.904
And it's me.

01:18:57.912 --> 01:19:01.477
I do not think hockey.

01:19:03.131 --> 01:19:07.712
I'm the real Tooth fairy.
- No, you do not.

01:19:19.310 --> 01:19:24.610
"You are the real Tooth fairy.
- Did our secret, ok?

01:20:07.028 --> 01:20:08.871
Randy.

01:20:11.171 --> 01:20:12.881
What are you doing here?

01:20:13.922 --> 01:20:16.862
I need
talking to you.

01:20:17.272 --> 01:20:20.793
Go away.
- Listen here ...

01:20:20.826 --> 01:20:25.092
I was wrong, what
I said yesterday.

01:20:25.913 --> 01:20:30.907
I do not care.
- You must continue
playing guitar.

01:20:30.942 --> 01:20:33.236
You really have talent.

01:20:33.397 --> 01:20:37.305
And something you love is
never a waste of time.

01:20:39.216 --> 01:20:41.642
I'm so sorry.

01:20:54.346 --> 01:20:58.020
Even if I would,
it still can not.

01:20:58.304 --> 01:21:01.010
I have destroyed my
Guitar, remember?

01:21:01.081 --> 01:21:03.889
So no talent show.

01:21:07.083 --> 01:21:08.242
Hold on.

01:21:24.311 --> 01:21:26.991
Maybe this helps?

01:21:28.168 --> 01:21:30.542
That's great!

01:21:30.883 --> 01:21:34.797
How did you do?
- Magic generator
for all purposes.

01:21:36.981 --> 01:21:38.953
What clothes do you have?

01:21:39.026 --> 01:21:42.796
There you will find out.
And now for the clothes
and talent show.

01:21:43.592 --> 01:21:44.781
Come on.

01:21:49.439 --> 01:21:51.080
Derek.

01:21:51.692 --> 01:21:56.053
Mama! Derek is the tooth fairy.

01:22:02.895 --> 01:22:08.576
You have a fairy costume rental
property to do with Tess.

01:22:08.609 --> 01:22:10.566
Yes.

01:22:10.714 --> 01:22:13.621
That is what I did.

01:22:15.210 --> 01:22:17.867
Derek is giving me a new guitar,
and brings me to the talent show.

01:22:17.868 --> 01:22:19.953
What time is it?
You never get.

01:22:19.954 --> 01:22:22.161
Do not worry, it will
we make it on time.

01:22:22.258 --> 01:22:25.709
You like that.
And you get dressed we
see you there.

01:22:27.809 --> 01:22:30.077
Oh yes.

01:22:30.110 --> 01:22:32.732
Where is your car?
- No car in front.

01:22:33.788 --> 01:22:35.898
Hold on.

01:22:39.002 --> 01:22:41.687
How can it be?
- It's good.

01:22:41.852 --> 01:22:42.857
How is this possible?

01:22:42.858 --> 01:22:46.034
On one particular evening, I found
an appeal under my pillow.

01:22:46.035 --> 01:22:47.373
What is a call?

01:22:47.374 --> 01:22:50.468
This is an invitation to
go to feenland.

01:22:50.469 --> 01:22:52.580
Feenland?
- Yes, I got these wings.

01:22:52.581 --> 01:22:53.991
I have met a person
who called Tracy.

01:22:53.992 --> 01:22:57.090
He looks like a tooth maker
but with the eyes of a tuna.

01:22:57.091 --> 01:23:00.284
Moreover, I could shrink
me to ten centimeters.

01:23:01.992 --> 01:23:04.095
Will we again?

01:23:09.514 --> 01:23:11.328
What is it?

01:23:13.266 --> 01:23:17.046
Sorry mate, but
I have enough rules.

01:23:26.020 --> 01:23:28.917
Randy, there you are.
I searched everywhere. You're turn.

01:23:28.918 --> 01:23:31.482
Quickly and be ready.

01:23:31.916 --> 01:23:34.208
Another tooth.
- Thanks.

01:23:34.209 --> 01:23:36.444
Sure.
Now I will go to a concert.

01:23:36.536 --> 01:23:39.417
The best have some rules violated, Mr.
Thompson.

01:23:39.418 --> 01:23:41.972
But I have helped Carly
and then Randy ...

01:23:41.973 --> 01:23:45.107
and Tess is only six years, so
that it will soon forget.

01:23:45.220 --> 01:23:48.013
Although they do not forget that
they now at least ...

01:23:48.404 --> 01:23:52.957
... They will always
- Always know what?

01:23:57.714 --> 01:24:01.670
They will always have faith.

01:24:01.694 --> 01:24:03.976
Like me.

01:24:04.098 --> 01:24:09.290
I get it now, dreams are good.
For all.

01:24:13.727 --> 01:24:15.112
Mr. Thompson ...

01:24:17.172 --> 01:24:21.927
I hereby relieve you
Tooth fairy from service.

01:24:26.607 --> 01:24:29.218
You're right.
- She is a pro.

01:24:29.314 --> 01:24:31.332
Congratulations.

01:24:31.552 --> 01:24:34.501
Stop it this way.

01:24:40.086 --> 01:24:44.065
I prefer that no
physical contact.

01:24:44.161 --> 01:24:46.179
You can find me funny.
I know you liked me.

01:24:46.180 --> 01:24:49.148
You have now very much
away, I know ...

01:24:49.149 --> 01:24:52.533
but somewhere in there,
do you like me.

01:24:57.419 --> 01:24:59.901
Not doing so frisky.

01:25:00.009 --> 01:25:03.470
I really must go.
- Can you still waiting?

01:25:03.471 --> 01:25:06.306
Tracy, I must also speak with you.

01:25:07.046 --> 01:25:11.231
What is it?
- Everybody that Mr.
Thompson can recover ...

01:25:11.374 --> 01:25:15.527
deserves it more
than any other.

01:25:23.921 --> 01:25:28.009
Is there ...?
- These are your wings, Tracy.

01:25:28.057 --> 01:25:32.418
Wear them with pride, each
once you download a tooth.

01:25:32.871 --> 01:25:34.848
You are a dental, companion.
- I have my wings.

01:25:34.944 --> 01:25:36.880
You have your wings.

01:25:37.264 --> 01:25:39.629
See that you need fixed.

01:25:40.008 --> 01:25:42.614
I just do not know why
I talk so crazy.

01:25:48.050 --> 01:25:50.350
Thank you, Lady.

01:25:50.933 --> 01:25:53.317
This is all good and I am
very proud of you ...

01:25:53.318 --> 01:25:55.474
you are the biggest Tooth fairy world,
but I really need to go.

01:25:55.475 --> 01:25:57.541
Someone must help me down here.

01:25:57.574 --> 01:26:01.535
Tracy, you will do, or
should I do?

01:26:02.279 --> 01:26:04.451
A gift?

01:26:04.484 --> 01:26:06.421
I'm afraid not.

01:26:07.842 --> 01:26:10.616
You will soon no longer remember
what happened here.

01:26:10.650 --> 01:26:12.245
Why?

01:26:12.279 --> 01:26:15.288
Because we always do.

01:26:18.178 --> 01:26:20.185
I will never forget.

01:26:23.444 --> 01:26:26.567
I still can not believe
you came into the game.

01:26:27.088 --> 01:26:29.736
This is because it is here.

01:26:31.879 --> 01:26:35.926
Thank you, Tracy. For everything.

01:26:38.259 --> 01:26:42.871
You big giraffe with your four eyes.
Back to the zoo.

01:26:44.172 --> 01:26:47.195
And you and running back
to Easter Island.

01:26:49.161 --> 01:26:50.863
Brothers are still in town.

01:26:51.138 --> 01:26:53.599
Let me once again
meeting the guys.

01:26:56.020 --> 01:26:58.541
You are my husband.
- And you are my fee.

01:26:58.542 --> 01:27:00.170
Maybe we should keep in touch.
With e-mail?

01:27:00.571 --> 01:27:01.795
We will meet best email.

01:27:01.895 --> 01:27:03.542
Do you blog?
- I blog too.

01:27:03.543 --> 01:27:05.923
I would like to read your blog. Facebook?
- Really?

01:27:06.023 --> 01:27:08.052
I can bury you.
- I think that is fantastic.

01:27:24.366 --> 01:27:26.323
There you are, I found you.

01:27:26.324 --> 01:27:28.654
Yes, I had to ...

01:27:31.168 --> 01:27:35.552
I am so excited.
- I.

01:27:35.606 --> 01:27:38.433
Thank you.
- You're welcome.

01:27:39.087 --> 01:27:41.606
Hi, honey.
- Hi, Derek.

01:27:48.033 --> 01:27:49.224
Come on, Randy.

01:27:49.225 --> 01:27:51.253
Still a big applause for
our newest artist ...

01:27:51.254 --> 01:27:53.902
Randy Harris.

01:27:58.457 --> 01:28:00.838
Randy!

01:28:27.774 --> 01:28:30.344
You go, Randy!

01:29:47.057 --> 01:29:49.776
Well done Randy!

01:30:04.512 --> 01:30:08.237
I wondered why
we do not marry?

01:30:12.986 --> 01:30:15.868
What if we get married?

01:30:17.045 --> 01:30:19.999
Did you hear what I said?

01:30:20.870 --> 01:30:23.406
I said "what if".

01:30:25.354 --> 01:30:26.679
Yes.

01:30:35.933 --> 01:30:38.440
We get married.
