00:00.001 --> 00:02.835
(Bird chirps,
door opens, bell jingles)

00:02.837 --> 00:04.536
- John!
- Oh, I was starting to think--

00:04.538 --> 00:06.038
- I've been hijacked.

00:06.040 --> 00:10.175
- What?
- My campaign has been hijacked.

00:10.177 --> 00:12.177
Oh, I need some tea. Twyla?

00:12.179 --> 00:13.579
- What's going on?

00:13.581 --> 00:15.881
- Tea?
- No thank you.

00:15.883 --> 00:19.051
- Ugh! My campaign signs
have gone missing.

00:19.053 --> 00:20.819
- What?
- You had election signs?

00:20.821 --> 00:23.756
- Yes! All of them! Gone!
- Wow.

00:23.758 --> 00:25.891
Maybe people were mowing
their lawns.

00:25.893 --> 00:27.493
- Well, it's probably just kids.

00:27.495 --> 00:30.596
- What if there's a more
sinister explanation?

00:30.598 --> 00:33.432
- Oh, like the wind.

00:33.434 --> 00:35.501
- I was wondering if there's
someone who's thinking,

00:35.503 --> 00:38.137
"Oh, this woman may not
have many signs,

00:38.139 --> 00:41.340
but she has myriad qualities
worth voting for.

00:41.342 --> 00:44.076
I must stop her!"

00:44.078 --> 00:46.111
- So you think the signs
were stolen?

00:46.113 --> 00:48.414
- Stolen? Ew!

00:48.416 --> 00:49.848
Is that what you think happened?

00:49.850 --> 00:51.917
- Well, isn't that what
you were implying?

00:51.919 --> 00:54.420
- Who would do that?
- Well, I don't know. It's dirty pool.

00:54.422 --> 00:56.488
You can't sabotage
someone's campaign

00:56.490 --> 00:57.890
and take their signs.

00:57.892 --> 01:00.359
- Please, please,
everyone calm down!

01:02.763 --> 01:03.762
Well, I suppose if there's
a silver lining in all this,

01:03.764 --> 01:05.631
it's that...

01:05.633 --> 01:08.033
someone is imitated enough
into thinking

01:08.035 --> 01:10.302
that I might be affecting
this town's

01:10.304 --> 01:13.572
long-established voting
patterns.

01:19.680 --> 01:24.283
♪ ♪

01:25.686 --> 01:27.186
(Tapping)

01:27.188 --> 01:29.421
(Cars rumble, tapping)

01:34.862 --> 01:36.562
JOHNNY: Oh good. Good.

01:36.564 --> 01:38.564
Now the playing field
is more fair.

01:38.566 --> 01:41.567
Yeah, I was worried Jocelyn
didn't have enough signs up.

01:41.569 --> 01:43.635
- Ah. You and me both, pal,

01:43.637 --> 01:46.305
but, luckily,
I'm a step ahead of ya.

01:46.307 --> 01:48.474
- Okay, Enough with the signs,
Roland.

01:48.476 --> 01:49.875
It was overkill a week ago.

01:49.877 --> 01:51.343
- Well, I don't know about you,
Johnny,

01:51.345 --> 01:55.047
but I would like my little lady
to win this campaign.

01:55.049 --> 01:56.748
- Oh! Well, funny you should
mention,

01:56.750 --> 02:01.253
because my little lady had all
of her lawn signs disappear.

02:01.255 --> 02:03.222
- Oh. Moira had lawn signs?

02:03.224 --> 02:05.090
- She had a few.

02:05.092 --> 02:06.859
Now she has none.

02:06.861 --> 02:10.028
- Wait. Are you saying
that I had something--

02:10.030 --> 02:11.930
- I'm not pointing any fingers,
- Uh-huh.

02:11.932 --> 02:14.066
- But if I find out you had
anything to do with this,

02:14.068 --> 02:15.701
even though you're acting
like you don't--

02:15.703 --> 02:18.470
- Well, if I find out
that you're accusing me

02:18.472 --> 02:20.005
of doing something I didn't do,

02:20.007 --> 02:22.407
then I'm going to accuse you
of making false accusations.

02:22.409 --> 02:25.344
- Fine. But if you're denying
doing something

02:25.346 --> 02:26.879
you might have done

02:26.881 --> 02:30.182
and making me feel guilty...

02:30.184 --> 02:33.719
for accusing you of something
you claim you didn't do--

02:33.721 --> 02:36.755
- Ooh, is that a threat?

02:36.757 --> 02:37.804
- I think so.

02:37.830 --> 02:41.994
- Because I don't wanna tell
you how I respond to threats.

02:41.996 --> 02:44.263
- And I don't wanna tell you
how I respond

02:44.265 --> 02:46.999
to illegal political activity.

02:47.001 --> 02:48.500
- Okay, fine, then don't.

02:48.502 --> 02:50.502
- Fine, I won't.

02:52.706 --> 02:55.040
Maybe.

02:56.911 --> 02:59.011
- Oh dear God. Yes.

03:00.981 --> 03:02.514
Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

03:02.516 --> 03:06.618
Well then, take it out of
my savings account.

03:06.620 --> 03:08.687
Well, what about the air miles?

03:08.689 --> 03:11.557
Can you put some of them
towards the electricity bill?

03:11.559 --> 03:15.327
- Okay, this signage,
is not really on brand.

03:15.329 --> 03:17.296
- It's not ridiculous.

03:17.298 --> 03:19.831
Well, I'm not having
this conversation either.

03:19.833 --> 03:22.267
(Phone clicks)
- Is everything okay?

03:22.269 --> 03:24.703
- David, to be honest,

03:26.173 --> 03:28.640
I'm having a little trouble
financially

03:28.642 --> 03:30.776
and I'm gonna have
to let you go.

03:30.778 --> 03:33.645
- What?
- It seems I have overshot my budget

03:33.647 --> 03:36.615
with the changes
you've been implementing.

03:36.617 --> 03:39.318
Which is not your fault.

03:39.320 --> 03:44.056
You were my mistake,
which I take full credit for.

03:44.058 --> 03:46.091
- Okay, I thought
you were liking

03:46.093 --> 03:47.492
the changes I was making.

03:47.494 --> 03:49.361
We just sold another poncho
yesterday.

03:49.363 --> 03:52.130
- I still can't believe
we even sold one.

03:52.132 --> 03:55.500
But that's not gonna help me
when I am down to a Costco card

03:55.502 --> 03:57.436
and a zoo membership.

03:57.438 --> 03:59.471
- Okay. Well, is there anything
I can do?

03:59.473 --> 04:01.907
- No, you've done enough
already.

04:01.909 --> 04:05.577
Fortunately, I have gotten
some good news.

04:05.579 --> 04:09.348
Apparently there is
a Blouse Barn in Australia

04:09.350 --> 04:13.452
and they are gonna pay me
to use their name here.

04:15.055 --> 04:16.488
Can you believe it?

04:16.490 --> 04:18.991
- That there's another store
called Blouse Barn? No.

04:18.993 --> 04:21.560
- No, it's an entire chain.

04:21.562 --> 04:23.929
They're expanding
into North America

04:23.931 --> 04:26.732
and they are gonna pay me
$10,000

04:26.734 --> 04:31.103
just to cover the costs
of renaming the store.

04:31.105 --> 04:33.171
- Okay, so they're buying
the name from you?

04:33.173 --> 04:35.274
- Well, it's more of a gesture
actually.

04:35.276 --> 04:39.878
Apparently, I have been using the
name without their permission.

04:39.880 --> 04:42.914
- Okay, so this company is giving
you $10,000 as a gesture...

04:42.916 --> 04:45.851
- And to think I almost called
this place "Blouse House."

04:45.853 --> 04:47.786
- Something seems really
sketchy about this

04:47.788 --> 04:49.187
and I'm not just saying that

04:49.189 --> 04:51.256
because I have a hard time
with Australians.

04:51.258 --> 04:53.292
Lotta drunks.
- Well, it's already happening.

04:53.294 --> 04:54.726
They're coming in this week,

04:54.728 --> 04:56.762
they're bringing
the paperwork...

04:56.764 --> 04:58.196
- As your Brand Manager,

04:58.198 --> 05:00.265
I feel like I need to be
at that meeting.

05:00.267 --> 05:02.701
- I don't know...

05:02.703 --> 05:04.303
- At least let me talk to a
few people before you decide.

05:04.305 --> 05:05.737
If there's one thing I've
learned from The Good Wife,

05:05.739 --> 05:08.173
it's never accept a first offer.

05:08.175 --> 05:10.475
I... I'm gonna just... do that.
- Oh.

05:11.912 --> 05:14.079
(Brush bristles swish)

05:17.618 --> 05:20.652
- I have a question.
- Yes, your cologne is too strong.

05:20.654 --> 05:23.288
- Okay, I just put it on

05:23.290 --> 05:25.557
and it needs to breathe
a bit, so...

05:25.559 --> 05:28.393
I... came in here to ask

05:28.395 --> 05:33.665
whether you knew anything about
trademarking store names?

05:33.667 --> 05:35.100
- Yeah. We had to deal
with that

05:35.102 --> 05:37.269
from time to time
at Rose Video.

05:37.271 --> 05:42.374
- Uh-huh. And did anyone ever
ask you to stop using the name?

05:43.777 --> 05:46.511
- No, but we went after
other people for using it.

05:46.513 --> 05:50.248
I remember a-a "Rosie's Video"
in Sao Paolo.

05:50.250 --> 05:51.950
That was a fun shakedown.

05:51.952 --> 05:55.387
- Mm-hmm. Okay, well,
say you owned Blouse Barn.

05:55.389 --> 05:57.823
- Well, first of all, I'd never
get into the clothing business

05:57.825 --> 05:59.458
'cause the margins are
terrible--

05:59.460 --> 06:00.992
- Okay, let's pretend for a sec.

06:00.994 --> 06:05.397
And someone was offering you
$10,000 to stop using the name

06:05.399 --> 06:08.066
because there's another
Blouse Barn in Australia

06:08.068 --> 06:09.835
and they need the name.

06:09.837 --> 06:13.438
- $10,000 to stop using
the name "Blouse Barn?"

06:13.440 --> 06:15.207
- That's correct.
- I would take that in a second.

06:15.209 --> 06:17.609
It's a terrible name.

06:17.611 --> 06:18.543
- Okay, but that's not--
- Now at least with "Rose Video,"

06:18.545 --> 06:20.145
it said what it was,

06:20.147 --> 06:22.547
and the logo looked great
on a golf shirt.

06:22.549 --> 06:24.583
- Yeah, I'm just thinking
if it's a big chain

06:24.585 --> 06:26.218
and they want the name,

06:26.220 --> 06:29.421
surely you should be able
to get more for it.

06:29.423 --> 06:31.590
- Yeah, but is worth
going to court to fight it?

06:31.592 --> 06:33.392
- Oh, I don't think Wendy
can afford that.

06:33.394 --> 06:35.127
She can't even afford me
anymore, so...

06:35.129 --> 06:37.696
- Wait a minute. You were fired?

06:37.698 --> 06:39.598
- Technically, I would say

06:39.600 --> 06:42.334
I'm in a transition phase
at the moment.

06:42.336 --> 06:43.835
- This is terrible news.

06:43.837 --> 06:45.937
I thought you were turning
that store around.

06:45.939 --> 06:48.240
All those big purchases,
all that spending--

06:48.242 --> 06:50.242
- Okay, let's just focus on
the big picture,

06:50.244 --> 06:52.711
which is helping the store.

06:52.713 --> 06:54.212
- Well, if you wanna help
the store,

06:54.214 --> 06:56.581
I would tell your boss
to take the deal.

06:56.583 --> 06:59.251
And then you and I are gonna
sit down, update your resume,

06:59.253 --> 07:01.153
and get you back
into the workforce.

07:01.155 --> 07:03.255
- Okay. Well, thank you so much
for this.

07:03.257 --> 07:07.926
Um, it was entirely unhelpful,
but thank you nevertheless.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.629
- Well... anytime, son.

07:12.065 --> 07:14.833
MOIRA: Oh, it's just
so violating.

07:14.835 --> 07:17.936
How can one sleep knowing our
streets are laden with thieves?

07:17.938 --> 07:19.571
RONNIE: Well, I don't know
about laden.

07:19.573 --> 07:22.207
I had a newspaper stolen once.

07:22.209 --> 07:24.843
- Two days ago, we had someone
break our window.

07:24.845 --> 07:26.278
They didn't take anything,

07:26.280 --> 07:28.280
but they left a dead bird
inside.

07:28.282 --> 07:30.916
- That's kind of like my aunt.

07:30.918 --> 07:33.018
She has a ghost in her house that
keeps leaving dimes everywhere.

07:33.020 --> 07:34.686
- Look what's happened to us.

07:34.688 --> 07:38.924
These sign bandits have clearly
created a culture of fear.

07:38.926 --> 07:40.325
- If it helps at all,
I'd be happy

07:40.327 --> 07:42.060
to put one of your signs
on my lawn.

07:42.062 --> 07:44.596
Th-that is if Jocelyn
doesn't mind.

07:44.598 --> 07:47.265
- Oh no, I'd put one on my lawn

07:47.267 --> 07:49.034
if I wasn't worried
about winning.

07:49.036 --> 07:50.735
(Laughs nervously)

07:50.737 --> 07:53.205
I hope you know that I don't
stand for dirty politics, Moira.

07:53.207 --> 07:55.140
- Oh no, you mustn't beat
yourself up.

07:55.142 --> 07:57.275
You have your own signs
to worry about.

07:57.277 --> 07:59.277
All two hundred of them.

08:01.281 --> 08:06.151
- Well... we're here to sing,
aren't we? So... let's sing!

08:06.153 --> 08:08.587
- Well said! Let us focus
on tomorrow's show

08:08.589 --> 08:10.889
and not fan the flames
of this provocative scandal

08:10.891 --> 08:12.290
any more than is necessary.

08:12.292 --> 08:14.292
Sing ladies... if you can.

08:15.796 --> 08:18.163
(Low hum of chatter)
RONNIE: Let's do this.

08:18.165 --> 08:20.031
(Door opens and closes)

08:20.033 --> 08:21.833
- Hey.

08:21.835 --> 08:23.902
(Gasps) What're you shopping
for?

08:23.904 --> 08:25.337
- I'm not shopping.

08:25.339 --> 08:27.405
- Okay, well, I'm seeing a lot
of women's tops,

08:27.407 --> 08:29.241
so if there's a minimum amount
for free shipping

08:29.243 --> 08:30.709
can let me know before
you order?

08:30.711 --> 08:33.111
Okay, yeah, no, I'm...
I'm actually doing work, so.

08:33.113 --> 08:35.547
- Mm... Dad said that
you got fired.

08:35.549 --> 08:37.649
- I wasn't fired.

08:37.651 --> 08:40.452
I'm... actually working
so that I can stay employed.

08:40.454 --> 08:42.087
I have a big meeting
with some lawyers

08:42.089 --> 08:43.455
and I'm trying to make sure

08:43.457 --> 08:45.357
they're not taking advantage
of Wendy.

08:45.359 --> 08:46.858
Poor thing is a hot mess.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.761
- Okay, I just really think you
should stay out of it, David.

08:49.763 --> 08:52.163
You're not good under pressure.

08:52.165 --> 08:53.965
- And you are?
- Um, I'm sorry. Were you picked up

08:53.967 --> 08:56.935
by the South Korean
Secret Police on New Year's?

08:56.937 --> 08:58.537
I had to sweet talk
the consulate's lawyer

08:58.539 --> 09:00.872
to get me a passport
before midnight.

09:00.874 --> 09:04.242
- Okay, well this is a very
different situation from that

09:04.244 --> 09:07.312
and I'm pretty sure
I'm gonna be fine.

09:07.314 --> 09:10.015
(Keyboard keys clack)

09:10.017 --> 09:10.570
(Loud thump)

09:10.596 --> 09:12.384
- Did you or did you not have
a subscription to Cosmo Girl

09:12.386 --> 09:15.286
when you were 16 years old,
David?

09:17.724 --> 09:19.090
- No.

09:19.092 --> 09:20.492
- Okay, David, if you have
to lie about something

09:20.494 --> 09:22.060
you should breathe out
while you answer

09:22.062 --> 09:23.828
'cause it really just calms
you down.

09:23.830 --> 09:26.398
- Oh my God! I'm not being
interrogated.

09:26.400 --> 09:27.799
This is a negotiation.

09:27.801 --> 09:29.768
- I'm just trying
to prepare you, okay?

09:29.770 --> 09:32.003
'Cause they're gonna
eat you alive in there.

09:32.005 --> 09:35.173
- Okay. If you know
so much about this,

09:35.175 --> 09:37.742
why don't you come with me then?

09:37.744 --> 09:39.177
- Okay, well, I guess
that just depends

09:39.179 --> 09:40.979
on what's in Mom's closet.

09:40.981 --> 09:42.414
- Why does that matter?

09:42.416 --> 09:43.782
- Well, I'm not gonna wear
my own clothes

09:43.784 --> 09:45.450
into the room, David.

09:45.452 --> 09:47.786
They're not scary enough.

09:51.658 --> 09:53.091
- (Sighs heavily)

09:57.264 --> 09:58.663
ALEXIS: I know we just met,

09:58.665 --> 10:00.298
but if Prince Harry trusted me
with his life,

10:00.300 --> 10:01.900
then I think you can too.

10:01.902 --> 10:04.603
- Well, I do feel better
having a lawyer in the room.

10:04.605 --> 10:07.272
- (Gasps) Oh my God,
you're so cute.

10:07.274 --> 10:08.773
Um, I'm not a lawyer,

10:08.775 --> 10:10.775
but I'm glad that
my fashion pony is working.

10:10.777 --> 10:12.210
(Door creaks open)

10:12.212 --> 10:16.648
- Oh, hi. I'm Wendy Kurtz.
Welcome to the Blouse Barn.

10:16.650 --> 10:18.416
- Lisa Chung.

10:18.418 --> 10:20.352
I didn't realize there were
gonna be more of us.

10:20.354 --> 10:22.420
- We're her representation.

10:22.422 --> 10:24.456
- David Rose.

10:24.458 --> 10:28.360
- Angelica Bloomfield of Rose,
Bloomfield and Glickman.

10:28.362 --> 10:31.363
- Well, let's go to my office
shall we?

10:32.899 --> 10:35.900
STEVIE: Oh, Mr. Rose!
JOHNNY: Oh, Hi Stevie.

10:35.902 --> 10:39.671
- I found these. I thought
Mrs. Rose might want 'em back.

10:39.673 --> 10:42.107
- You found them?

10:42.109 --> 10:45.210
Okay, look, I know we haven't
always been ideal motel guests,

10:45.212 --> 10:48.246
but taking my wife's signs?

10:48.248 --> 10:51.750
- Ah, no, I took out
your garbage,

10:51.752 --> 10:54.853
and these poked a hole
in the bottom and fell out.

10:54.855 --> 10:57.222
So... they're still in
pretty good shape,

10:57.224 --> 10:59.891
I thought she might
want them back.

10:59.893 --> 11:01.359
- Oh...

11:01.361 --> 11:03.795
- Since she's been so worried
about her signs

11:03.797 --> 11:05.964
having been mysteriously
stolen.

11:05.966 --> 11:07.465
- Right, right.

11:07.467 --> 11:11.703
Well, I mean, I can see
what must have happened here.

11:11.705 --> 11:14.773
She accidentally,
uh, threw them out.

11:16.176 --> 11:18.643
- That's one theory.

11:18.645 --> 11:22.981
Or... someone stole them
and hid them in our garbage

11:24.518 --> 11:26.918
to try and sabotage Moira

11:26.920 --> 11:32.223
to make it look like she's done
something... really crazy.

11:32.225 --> 11:35.326
- That is definitely
some food for thought.

11:35.328 --> 11:36.828
- Yeah.
- Mm.

11:36.830 --> 11:40.799
- Well, Thank you, Stevie.
Have a nice day.

11:40.801 --> 11:43.034
- Thanks. I will.

11:45.806 --> 11:48.907
- This shouldn't take long.
The check.

11:48.909 --> 11:52.977
This should cover the cost
of the signs, business cards...

11:52.979 --> 11:55.814
- About the check.
- (Clears throat)

11:55.816 --> 11:59.484
We had some questions
about the amount.

11:59.486 --> 12:00.919
- Well, you shouldn't.

12:00.921 --> 12:04.022
$10,000 is the amount
we agreed upon.

12:04.024 --> 12:05.690
- Well, that may be,

12:05.692 --> 12:08.193
but some things have changed
on our side,

12:08.195 --> 12:10.462
and we want to discuss the--

12:10.464 --> 12:12.230
- I think it's fine, David.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.631
- From a legal standpoint,

12:13.633 --> 12:16.334
There are lots of costs
to consider.

12:16.336 --> 12:17.076
- Mm-hmm.

12:17.102 --> 12:20.038
- There are the signs and
the business cards...

12:20.040 --> 12:22.273
- I just mentioned those.

12:22.275 --> 12:24.109
- Objection sustained.

12:24.111 --> 12:26.745
There is the travel,
there are the meals,

12:26.747 --> 12:29.714
There is the shipping
and the catering...

12:29.716 --> 12:31.149
- Which is very similar
to the meals

12:31.151 --> 12:33.918
and not necessarily relevant,
so...

12:33.920 --> 12:37.555
'Kay. Well, the $10,000 doesn't
even cover our legal fees, so...

12:37.557 --> 12:39.691
- What?
- Don't worry about that.

12:39.693 --> 12:41.559
And if we're gonna announce
a new name,

12:41.561 --> 12:43.461
there has to be
a whole relaunch event,

12:43.463 --> 12:46.264
and that involves...
event planners

12:46.266 --> 12:48.066
and, um, florists.

12:48.068 --> 12:50.902
- Okay, I think what my
colleague is trying to say,

12:50.904 --> 12:54.606
is that our brand is
very well established here,

12:54.608 --> 13:00.145
um, so we're going to require
a higher compensation.

13:02.983 --> 13:06.684
- No, it's... Ooh-ooh-ooh,
Ooh-ooh-ooh. Ooh--

13:06.686 --> 13:09.487
No! No, no, Gwen,
you took the lower third.

13:09.489 --> 13:12.290
Well, could you please then?
I've already locked mine in.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.492
Thanks, doll.

13:16.696 --> 13:18.997
- Moira, do you have any idea

13:18.999 --> 13:22.667
how Stevie found your campaign
signs in our garbage?

13:22.669 --> 13:25.170
- I don't think anyone
can hear us, John.

13:25.172 --> 13:27.539
You don't have to keep up
the act.

13:27.541 --> 13:30.542
- What act?
- That you didn't know I took the signs.

13:30.544 --> 13:32.143
- You took your signs?

13:32.145 --> 13:33.511
I didn't know you took
the signs.

13:33.513 --> 13:35.246
Why would you take
your own signs?

13:35.248 --> 13:36.681
- Well, I couldn't very well
take Jocelyn's.

13:36.683 --> 13:38.183
That would be stealing

13:38.185 --> 13:40.018
and I'm running
a clean campaign.

13:40.020 --> 13:42.153
- You call this
a clean campaign?

13:42.155 --> 13:43.955
- Politics 101, John.

13:43.957 --> 13:45.824
When you have limited
resources,

13:45.826 --> 13:48.660
your best course of action
is to create a stir.

13:48.662 --> 13:50.562
It's exciting, it's fun.

13:50.564 --> 13:52.096
It's like that episode
of Sunrise Bay

13:52.098 --> 13:53.798
when I stole my own baby.

13:53.800 --> 13:56.701
- Moira, Sunrise Bay
was a soap opera.

13:56.703 --> 13:58.937
- Yes, and this is reality.

13:58.939 --> 14:01.606
Frankly, John,
I'm surprised at your naivety.

14:01.608 --> 14:03.775
- Moira, you're misleading
people!

14:03.777 --> 14:05.944
- No, I'm building a mystery.

14:05.946 --> 14:08.246
Voters will draw
their own conclusions.

14:08.248 --> 14:10.181
- I basically accused Roland

14:10.183 --> 14:13.418
of stealing your campaign signs.

14:13.420 --> 14:15.520
- Well, then hopefully
you've learned something -

14:15.522 --> 14:18.223
you shouldn't make accusations
you can't substantiate.

14:18.225 --> 14:22.727
- Moira--
- I'm not listening until you calm down.

14:22.729 --> 14:24.562
(Door bangs shut)

14:27.968 --> 14:31.236
- Okay, well,
Blouse Barn Australia

14:31.238 --> 14:34.405
is willing to offer you
an additional $5,000.

14:34.407 --> 14:36.107
- Oh my God.
- Thank you.

14:36.109 --> 14:39.978
- So if you'll just sign here,
I think we're good.

14:39.980 --> 14:41.880
- I don't think we are.

14:41.882 --> 14:44.849
I have done some research
and I happen to know

14:44.851 --> 14:48.720
that your company pulled in
$100 million last year.

14:48.722 --> 14:51.155
- Point being?

14:51.157 --> 14:53.424
- Well, the point is, judging
by your bag and those shoes,

14:53.426 --> 14:54.792
Blouse Barn Australia
is paying you

14:54.794 --> 14:56.294
quite a bit of money
to come here

14:56.296 --> 14:59.530
and help us
"switch over our signs."

14:59.532 --> 15:02.767
Bottom line, we're standing
in your way

15:02.769 --> 15:05.770
and I don't think your client
will be very happy

15:05.772 --> 15:07.906
if you come home without
securing the rights to the name,

15:07.908 --> 15:09.507
especially considering
you're expanding

15:09.509 --> 15:11.676
into 78 stores across
North America.

15:11.678 --> 15:13.111
And let's be honest,

15:13.113 --> 15:17.015
"Blouse House" doesn't have
quite the same ring to it.

15:17.017 --> 15:20.285
- Exactly!
- Angelica, please.

15:20.287 --> 15:23.388
This is the number
that we are after.

15:24.758 --> 15:26.190
(Paper rustles)

15:28.395 --> 15:30.495
- (Derisive utterance)
- Now, if you'll excuse us,

15:30.497 --> 15:32.096
we have another meeting
to get to.

15:32.098 --> 15:33.665
- We're in our store.

15:33.667 --> 15:35.366
- We await your reply.

15:37.137 --> 15:39.971
(Low hum of chatter,
chairs thump)

15:42.375 --> 15:44.509
- Moira, I felt bad about
what happened to your signs

15:44.511 --> 15:49.013
and so I had some of my
students make these for you.

15:49.015 --> 15:51.149
- (Gasps) Jocelyn!

15:51.151 --> 15:53.518
- They're not as nice as the
black and white ones you had,

15:53.520 --> 15:55.687
but I thought that
they might help.

15:55.689 --> 15:58.323
- Very considerate.

15:58.325 --> 16:02.026
Though there's something you
and I still need to discuss.

16:02.028 --> 16:04.529
- The signs.

16:04.531 --> 16:07.398
- We both know that,
in a heated campaign,

16:07.400 --> 16:09.734
one might use whatever
resources one has

16:09.736 --> 16:13.037
to gain advantage.
- Yes.

16:13.039 --> 16:16.574
- Jocelyn, you have so many
signs!

16:16.576 --> 16:18.276
- I know. Roland got carried
away

16:18.278 --> 16:19.711
and used his mayoral power

16:19.713 --> 16:22.080
to get people to put more signs
on their lawns.

16:22.082 --> 16:26.317
And I just... pretended
it wasn't happening.

16:26.319 --> 16:28.886
- Roland forced constituents

16:28.888 --> 16:31.189
to put up signs through
coercion?

16:31.191 --> 16:32.790
- That's what we're talking
about, right?

16:32.792 --> 16:34.225
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm, yeah.

16:34.227 --> 16:37.128
I just was helping you explain,
so you--

16:37.130 --> 16:38.796
because you seem so upset
by it all.

16:38.798 --> 16:40.465
- I am upset.

16:40.467 --> 16:43.301
I don't like what this campaign
is doing to me.

16:43.303 --> 16:47.238
The other day, I called another
driver an effing moron.

16:47.240 --> 16:50.208
I didn't say the 'f' word,
but I said, 'effing,'

16:50.210 --> 16:52.176
and that is not me!

16:52.178 --> 16:54.946
- Jocelyn, I don't think
it's exactly unethical

16:54.948 --> 16:58.082
to do questionable things
in the spirit of competition.

16:58.084 --> 17:00.551
- I'm dropping out
of the campaign.

17:00.553 --> 17:02.720
- What?
- I'm barely sleeping,

17:02.722 --> 17:04.255
I can't get through an episode

17:04.257 --> 17:06.624
of MasterChef Junior
without crying.

17:06.626 --> 17:08.960
- We've both worked so hard
for this.

17:08.962 --> 17:12.296
- I know, and now I am giving
it to you.

17:15.435 --> 17:17.835
Congratulations, Moira.

17:17.837 --> 17:21.139
You are the new councilor
for the town of Schitt's Creek.

17:24.644 --> 17:26.577
WENDY: David, come on in!

17:26.579 --> 17:28.413
Here, have a seat.

17:30.784 --> 17:35.153
Lisa got back to me.
She dropped off a cheque.

17:35.155 --> 17:38.089
- (Groans)
- It's a big cheque, David.

17:38.091 --> 17:39.690
- Oh, thank God!

17:39.692 --> 17:41.859
- It's a bit (Bleeping) cheque!

17:41.861 --> 17:43.628
- Oh... (Laughs)

17:43.630 --> 17:46.764
Um, you don't mean one of those
big lottery cheques, right?

17:46.766 --> 17:47.886
- Okay.
- No

17:47.912 --> 17:48.666
- Okay

17:48.668 --> 17:51.135
- But you pulled it off!

17:51.137 --> 17:53.404
Um, thank you for trusting me.

17:53.406 --> 17:55.773
- Well, I wouldn't go that far.

17:55.775 --> 17:59.077
- Okay. Um... I guess we should
get back to work.

17:59.079 --> 18:01.079
- I love your enthusiasm,

18:01.081 --> 18:03.981
but I think I'm going
to take some time

18:03.983 --> 18:06.818
for my family, for me,

18:06.820 --> 18:08.619
and close the store.

18:08.621 --> 18:10.688
- Oh, okay.

18:10.690 --> 18:13.624
- But I appreciate
all you've done,

18:15.095 --> 18:18.663
and I want you to have this,
you and Alexis.

18:20.033 --> 18:21.766
- Well, Alexis didn't do
that much.

18:21.768 --> 18:23.501
- Oh, oh my God.

18:23.503 --> 18:27.038
And I hope this helps
get you on your feet.

18:27.040 --> 18:31.175
And do something interesting.
You always do.

18:31.177 --> 18:33.411
- I... can't accept this.

18:35.682 --> 18:37.315
(Low hum of chatter)

18:42.288 --> 18:45.523
- (Whispering) Moira!
- John.

18:48.461 --> 18:51.429
- I'm so excited
to see the show.

18:51.431 --> 18:53.297
- I'm going to be on council.

18:53.299 --> 18:56.501
- We'll, that's the spirit.
Positive thinking.

18:56.503 --> 18:59.904
- I won! Jocelyn quit
the election.

18:59.906 --> 19:01.305
- What?

19:01.307 --> 19:03.241
- She couldn't take it anymore.

19:03.243 --> 19:05.743
- Well, think what you can do
in four years.

19:05.745 --> 19:08.613
- Four years? No, No one said
anything about four years.

19:08.615 --> 19:11.182
- And-and the thought of
working with Roland every day.

19:11.184 --> 19:12.550
- I mean, that's...

19:12.552 --> 19:16.454
I wouldn't even think
about that.

19:16.456 --> 19:18.890
- Oh, John. What have I done?

19:20.493 --> 19:27.498
♪ 'Cuz tonight for the first
time ♪ (Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)

19:27.500 --> 19:28.900
♪ Just about half past ten ♪
(Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah)

19:28.902 --> 19:31.469
♪ For the first time

19:31.471 --> 19:35.173
♪ it's gonna be raining men ♪
- Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da bop!

19:39.212 --> 19:40.811
(Crickets chirp)

19:40.813 --> 19:42.246
- So...

19:44.017 --> 19:46.817
- $40,000?!

19:46.819 --> 19:48.853
- Oh, that's a lot of money.

19:48.855 --> 19:51.622
Wow! Even divided amongst
the four of us.

19:51.624 --> 19:55.726
- Divided? I'm the one
who negotiated all of this.

19:55.728 --> 19:57.562
- Um, with my help, David.

19:57.564 --> 20:00.798
- I believe I offered advice.

20:00.800 --> 20:04.502
- You said Wendy should cave
and take the first offer.

20:04.504 --> 20:07.638
What you gave was
the opposite of advice.

20:07.640 --> 20:09.640
- Okay, stop. This is good.

20:09.642 --> 20:12.843
This is the first real money
we've seen in a year.

20:12.845 --> 20:16.080
- 'Kay, I think we definitely
need to celebrate.

20:16.082 --> 20:18.282
Nothing big, just a little
treat...

20:18.284 --> 20:21.219
Like a trip.

20:21.221 --> 20:25.122
- Okay. I can't believe that
I'm the one to say this,

20:25.124 --> 20:27.458
but um... shouldn't we be s--

20:30.363 --> 20:33.965
Shouldn't we be s-s-s...

20:33.967 --> 20:37.301
Should we be--
trying to sa-- save this?

20:39.973 --> 20:41.339
Isn't--
Shouldn't we be saving--

20:41.341 --> 20:43.674
putting this in a bank?

20:43.676 --> 20:45.876
Isn't that what people do?

20:48.548 --> 20:51.215
- Well, that's no fun.

20:51.217 --> 20:55.519
- No... but probably best?

20:58.391 --> 21:00.124
- Maybe we could do manicures.

21:00.126 --> 21:01.993
- I could a manicure.
The three of us should go.

21:01.995 --> 21:03.928
- Yes!
- Long overdue.

21:03.930 --> 21:05.896
- Yeah, that's a good idea.
- Yay!

21:05.898 --> 21:07.999
- Wait a minute, wait a minute.
Just 'cause I do my own nails

21:08.001 --> 21:09.400
doesn't mean, you know,
I wouldn't go--

21:09.402 --> 21:10.801
- 'Kay, they're just expensive

21:10.803 --> 21:12.203
and you wouldn't really
appreciate them.

21:12.205 --> 21:15.506
- Oh yay, David! Yay!

21:17.877 --> 21:19.310
(Door closes)
