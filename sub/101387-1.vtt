WEBVTT

00:39.272 --> 00:40.540
Hmmm.

00:41.643 --> 00:43.510
So you think you've seen it all,
right?

00:44.746 --> 00:46.279
Until the moment
when you realize

00:46.313 --> 00:47.481
you've seen nothing.

00:48.683 --> 00:51.351
Absolutely nothing.

00:51.385 --> 00:54.588
And I am not talking about
seeing through your eyes,

00:54.622 --> 00:56.658
but through your soul.

00:56.691 --> 00:59.426
You think you know everything,
right?

00:59.459 --> 01:01.361
Until?

01:01.395 --> 01:03.397
Exactly.

01:03.430 --> 01:06.701
Until the moment you realize
you don't know anything.

01:07.802 --> 01:08.903
So let me tell you something.

01:09.737 --> 01:12.272
Millions of children
are going missing every year

01:12.305 --> 01:13.875
around the world.

01:13.908 --> 01:16.543
Half a million
in the United States alone.

01:17.544 --> 01:19.981
Yes, half...

01:20.014 --> 01:20.982
a...

01:21.015 --> 01:23.216
million.

01:23.250 --> 01:25.920
And they all have a story,

01:25.953 --> 01:28.956
but this one is special to me,

01:28.990 --> 01:31.693
because this is the story
of my child.

01:32.660 --> 01:36.430
My name is Michael Watson
and my daughter went missing.

02:14.802 --> 02:17.004
I was doing good,

02:17.038 --> 02:20.507
I mean I'm...
I'm trying stay on my path.

02:20.540 --> 02:23.945
But last week, I got this paper
from the hospital

02:23.978 --> 02:26.748
that made me very angry.

02:26.781 --> 02:30.283
It's like they all forgot
that he died in their hands...

02:30.317 --> 02:31.719
in their hands.

02:34.521 --> 02:36.556
This is their fault, okay?

02:36.590 --> 02:37.692
Ayi-yai-yai.

02:37.725 --> 02:39.526
- What am I doing here?
- And now they come after me.

02:39.559 --> 02:40.762
With what money?

02:40.795 --> 02:42.063
From where should I pay?

02:42.096 --> 02:43.931
- It's just me now.
- Marcy?

02:45.532 --> 02:50.437
Marcy, are you talking
from a place of anger or fear?

02:50.470 --> 02:51.606
No.

02:51.639 --> 02:53.473
This is not gonna work.

02:53.507 --> 02:55.610
- This is some bullshit.
- Desperation maybe.

02:55.643 --> 02:57.011
I mean anger and fear,
all of it together.

02:57.044 --> 02:59.446
I don't know anymore.

02:59.479 --> 03:01.348
Well,
if you could tell Andrew something...

03:01.381 --> 03:02.516
Okay, that is it.

03:02.549 --> 03:03.885
I am out of here.

03:03.918 --> 03:05.653
- Sorry.
- What?

03:05.686 --> 03:07.889
No, no, but no, no, no... this...

03:07.922 --> 03:09.489
Michael?

03:09.523 --> 03:10.825
This ain't right.

03:13.961 --> 03:15.295
It's okay.

03:46.928 --> 03:48.595
Hi, ma'am,
I'm sorry to disturb you,

03:48.629 --> 03:51.933
but uh, any chance
you've seen this little girl?

03:51.966 --> 03:52.934
No?

03:52.967 --> 03:56.570
Ah well, she's my daughter
and she's missing,

03:56.604 --> 03:59.974
so would you uh... would you mind
taking a flyer in case you see

04:00.007 --> 04:01.408
or hear anything?

04:02.442 --> 04:03.510
Appreciate it.

04:03.543 --> 04:05.012
I'm... I'm... I'm sorry again.

04:06.013 --> 04:07.148
Thank you.

04:07.181 --> 04:08.683
Have a good day.

04:08.716 --> 04:10.450
Call that number please
if you see her.

04:18.993 --> 04:21.428
There is a big charity event
going down tonight.

04:21.461 --> 04:22.429
Charity event?

04:22.462 --> 04:24.131
Fuck me, Jeff.

04:24.165 --> 04:25.465
Kid, if you don't want
the work,

04:25.498 --> 04:26.601
I can throw it to somebody else.

04:26.634 --> 04:30.004
You haven't given me anything
good in months, Jeffrey.

04:30.037 --> 04:31.739
I'm not interested
in charity events.

04:31.772 --> 04:34.075
Christian, get your head
out of your ass.

04:34.108 --> 04:37.577
That attitude is exactly
why I can't trust you

04:37.612 --> 04:38.511
with bigger stories anymore.

04:38.545 --> 04:41.148
Get over yourself
and start writing again.

04:41.182 --> 04:43.084
You haven't been delivering
for too long.

04:43.117 --> 04:45.518
Fine, okay.

04:45.552 --> 04:47.622
You're walking a very thin line
here, sport.

05:13.948 --> 05:14.615
Let it flow.

05:14.649 --> 05:15.716
Don't be so hard on yourself.

05:15.750 --> 05:17.184
Let it flow and you'll see.

05:17.218 --> 05:18.319
It all comes in.

05:18.352 --> 05:20.755
When you focus too much on it,
you get frustrated.

05:20.788 --> 05:22.723
So, let's go.

05:22.757 --> 05:24.524
Come on.

05:24.557 --> 05:26.160
One, two.
Come on, one, two.

05:26.193 --> 05:27.662
Chris, I need a better round,
baby,

05:27.695 --> 05:29.063
- you gotta focus.
- One, two, one two.

05:29.096 --> 05:30.064
Beautiful.

05:31.132 --> 05:31.832
Beautiful.

05:31.866 --> 05:32.366
- There you go.
- Stay relaxed.

05:32.400 --> 05:33.935
Keep your hands up.

05:33.968 --> 05:35.202
Yeah, there you go.

05:36.804 --> 05:37.470
One, two.

05:37.504 --> 05:38.940
Come on, man, are you serious?

05:38.973 --> 05:40.540
Are you gonna fucking focus
on this?

05:40.573 --> 05:41.441
We could do this all day.

05:41.474 --> 05:42.143
Do you wanna get yourself
knocked out?

05:42.176 --> 05:43.110
That was good. That was good.

05:43.144 --> 05:45.012
- That was like four times.
- Focus, man.

05:45.046 --> 05:45.947
Keep your hands up.

05:45.980 --> 05:47.648
You need to earn yours.

08:04.185 --> 08:05.585
Alright.

08:06.654 --> 08:08.222
This is better.

08:08.255 --> 08:11.058
You did good, kid.

08:11.092 --> 08:13.127
And here is another one for you.

08:13.160 --> 08:14.662
Can't wait.

08:14.695 --> 08:16.764
This one is gonna
require more digging.

08:18.232 --> 08:20.634
This little girl,
Monique Watson,

08:20.668 --> 08:22.970
disappeared from her apartment
eight days ago.

08:23.003 --> 08:25.239
The parents are
Michael and Tiffany,

08:25.272 --> 08:27.174
they have an older son, Andre.

08:28.309 --> 08:30.778
It's looking bleak
on finding her.

08:30.811 --> 08:31.612
I remember something.

08:31.645 --> 08:33.681
- We reported on it, right?
- Yeah.

08:34.982 --> 08:36.684
Is there something new?

08:36.717 --> 08:38.252
Well,
the cops aren't pursuing it.

08:38.285 --> 08:40.354
I mean you know how it is,
I mean a poor black family

08:40.387 --> 08:43.057
in a poor black neighborhood,
bam,

08:43.090 --> 08:44.391
the cops just aren't interested,

08:44.425 --> 08:46.193
literally,
they don't give a fuck.

08:46.227 --> 08:47.695
And why should they?

08:47.728 --> 08:49.797
They don't give medals for that,
right?

08:49.830 --> 08:51.398
I've read the stories.

08:51.432 --> 08:53.767
I want you to do
a follow-up on this.

08:53.801 --> 08:55.836
- Just check-in with the family?
- No, no, no, no.

08:55.870 --> 08:59.173
I want you to get over there
and see what you can dig up.

08:59.206 --> 09:01.275
You know, there might be
something real obvious,

09:01.308 --> 09:03.711
that the police missed
or haven't looked into

09:03.744 --> 09:05.679
or didn't really
wanna look into.

09:07.715 --> 09:10.417
Now this is something
I can sink my teeth into.

09:10.451 --> 09:12.386
This is a story.

09:12.419 --> 09:14.855
I wanna know what's
really going on out there.

09:19.927 --> 09:21.962
I need you to do me a favor.

09:21.996 --> 09:23.097
Can you pull a file for me?

09:23.130 --> 09:24.832
It's a missing person.

09:27.001 --> 09:28.936
A Monique Watson.

09:29.737 --> 09:32.273
Yeah, she went missing
eight days ago.

09:32.306 --> 09:34.074
And her parents
are Michael and Tiffany.

10:05.506 --> 10:07.341
Look, just walk away
I don't want 'em diggin' at us.

10:07.374 --> 10:08.809
Hey fellas.

10:08.842 --> 10:10.344
Fellas!

10:10.377 --> 10:12.379
Yo, what's up, young money?

10:12.413 --> 10:13.781
What, you got lost?

10:13.814 --> 10:16.317
No, I am just...
I am looking for a little information.

10:16.350 --> 10:18.687
I was wondering
if you maybe can help me out.

10:19.621 --> 10:22.957
Well, actually
I am looking for a building.

10:22.990 --> 10:24.391
Yo, no fucking way.

10:24.425 --> 10:27.761
Eh, yo bruh,
he looking for a building.

10:28.562 --> 10:30.931
No fucking way.

10:30.965 --> 10:33.801
Okay, actually
no, I'm looking for a family.

10:36.070 --> 10:37.304
Name's uh...

10:38.839 --> 10:40.507
Watson.

10:40.541 --> 10:42.910
The daughter went missing
a couple days ago.

10:46.547 --> 10:48.415
What, you police?

10:48.449 --> 10:49.817
No.

10:49.850 --> 10:50.784
News.

10:50.818 --> 10:52.319
My name is Christian.

10:52.353 --> 10:54.021
Christian, huh, bruh?

10:54.054 --> 10:56.323
That sounds um, royal.

10:59.893 --> 11:00.729
But look, bruh.

11:00.761 --> 11:02.830
Everybody heard about that girl,
alright?

11:02.863 --> 11:04.832
But that's the hood business
though, that ain't for you.

11:06.300 --> 11:08.202
Alright.
Yeah, I understand.

11:08.235 --> 11:09.470
I know how things go
around here.

11:11.405 --> 11:12.873
You do, huh?

11:15.876 --> 11:17.845
- I try.
- Oh, you do or you try?

11:21.949 --> 11:24.485
Look, I'm just trying
to get a little information.

11:24.518 --> 11:25.853
Now, it's my understanding

11:25.886 --> 11:27.588
that the police
haven't been too helpful.

11:27.622 --> 11:29.390
Yeah, no shit.

11:29.423 --> 11:31.325
'Cause all you motherfuckers
coming around here

11:31.358 --> 11:34.228
say you gonna help, ain't nobody
found that girl yet.

11:34.261 --> 11:36.830
And the only one that care
about us is us, you feel me?

11:45.607 --> 11:49.443
Look, my newspaper reaches
a lot of people.

11:50.511 --> 11:53.881
And sometimes it makes people
pay attention to something

11:53.914 --> 11:56.283
they haven't been
paying attention to before.

11:57.017 --> 11:59.219
And sometimes
those people are cops.

12:01.322 --> 12:03.590
You get where I'm going
with this?

12:03.625 --> 12:04.892
Uhuh.

12:06.927 --> 12:09.063
You understand
how things go out here?

12:11.465 --> 12:12.466
Yeah.

12:23.177 --> 12:25.212
That's a nice watch, man.

12:30.451 --> 12:33.053
You can take it or leave it,
100 or nothing.

12:37.991 --> 12:40.294
It's the building
on the back side,

12:40.327 --> 12:42.229
better walk around
in the alley.

12:42.262 --> 12:43.931
- Right there?
- It's right there.

12:45.232 --> 12:46.634
Alright, thanks.

12:49.403 --> 12:51.972
Do what the
fuck you wanna do, bruh.

12:54.174 --> 12:57.411
Oh, don't you waste a free pass.

12:57.444 --> 12:59.614
Might be the only one you get.

13:01.683 --> 13:02.883
Hey, hold the door.

13:04.686 --> 13:06.387
Thanks.

14:06.447 --> 14:07.615
Who is it?

14:07.649 --> 14:09.283
Christian Baker, sir.

14:09.316 --> 14:10.250
I'm with <i>The Chronicle</i>.

14:10.284 --> 14:12.019
I am looking for Michael Watson.

14:14.756 --> 14:17.524
- Mr. Watson?
- What exactly do you want?

14:17.558 --> 14:19.293
I'm just looking to get
your side of the story

14:19.326 --> 14:20.994
from Monique's disappearance.

14:21.028 --> 14:22.563
I'm here to help.

14:22.596 --> 14:24.465
Help?

14:24.498 --> 14:27.267
You can help me by getting
the fuck out of here.

14:30.705 --> 14:32.039
Mr. Watson?

14:45.152 --> 14:46.253
I'll get there
as soon as possible.

14:46.286 --> 14:47.354
I'm in Brooklyn right now.

14:47.387 --> 14:48.255
Yo, no luck?

14:48.288 --> 14:50.357
Alright, oh wait.

14:52.059 --> 14:53.293
Hey yo, come here, man.

14:53.327 --> 14:54.696
- I have to call you back.
- Don't be scared.

14:54.729 --> 14:57.097
Don't be scared, man.
Come here, come here.

14:58.098 --> 14:59.466
Dededede.

15:02.837 --> 15:04.706
Yeah, you were right,
they didn't want my help.

15:04.739 --> 15:06.774
I mean, look at you.

15:06.808 --> 15:07.775
Coming up to town,

15:07.809 --> 15:09.543
looking white as J. Lo
all that fancy shit on,

15:09.576 --> 15:11.245
of course
they didn't wanna talk to you.

15:11.278 --> 15:12.546
What the fuck are you gonna do?

15:12.579 --> 15:14.481
That little girl
is gone for a week.

15:14.515 --> 15:16.250
You got new information for me

15:16.283 --> 15:18.385
or you just stopping
me to bust my balls?

15:20.354 --> 15:22.389
Oh, you know how things
work out here.

15:24.124 --> 15:25.660
Yeah.

15:32.299 --> 15:36.136
Son, sometimes people
come up missing

15:36.169 --> 15:37.504
and sometime people disappear

15:37.538 --> 15:38.706
when other people
come up missing.

15:38.740 --> 15:39.707
You follow me?

15:40.808 --> 15:44.378
So maybe there's a guy
who went missing on the same day

15:44.411 --> 15:46.346
as the girl
and maybe that's related.

15:47.447 --> 15:49.182
Maybe it's not, I don't know.

15:51.184 --> 15:53.520
Yeah, maybe that guy
went on vacation.

15:53.554 --> 15:54.555
This nigga.

15:54.588 --> 15:55.723
Thanks, man.

15:55.757 --> 15:57.759
Hey, yo, yo,
now hold on, hold on, hold on.

15:57.792 --> 15:59.761
Yo, check out where you at.

15:59.794 --> 16:02.129
Now, do we look like
vacation people?

16:03.865 --> 16:08.302
You want more, I told you,
I like that watch, man.

16:24.886 --> 16:26.754
This guy is a cab driver, right?

16:28.488 --> 16:29.356
Haitian cat.

16:29.389 --> 16:31.726
He lived up here in B6.

16:31.759 --> 16:33.861
Now he's supposed to
be in that corner every day

16:33.895 --> 16:35.863
for like years, dog.

16:35.897 --> 16:38.198
I mean every fucking day
he was here like clockwork.

16:38.231 --> 16:40.534
This nigga never missed one.

16:40.567 --> 16:43.236
Until one day
he stopped being here.

16:43.270 --> 16:44.706
Now later the same day,

16:44.739 --> 16:46.473
the little girl pop come outside

16:46.506 --> 16:48.643
asking us if we seen her,
feel me?

16:48.676 --> 16:50.310
Now I'm not saying
these things are related,

16:50.344 --> 16:52.346
but come on, son,
this shit looking mad suspect.

16:55.683 --> 16:57.351
You mind if I quote you on that?

16:58.753 --> 16:59.654
Son, fuck yourself.

16:59.687 --> 17:02.122
I ain't no snitch, man.

17:02.924 --> 17:08.362
But yo, maybe that girl
is still alive somewhere.

17:08.395 --> 17:09.329
Yeah, maybe.

17:09.363 --> 17:11.633
Hey, time for you to be out,
nigga, let's go.

17:12.967 --> 17:14.836
Get the fuck out of here, man.

17:15.535 --> 17:16.771
Skinny white guy.

17:19.674 --> 17:21.843
I need you to pull
any missing persons reported

17:21.876 --> 17:26.246
within the 72 hours on
Monique Watson's disappearance.

17:26.279 --> 17:28.415
Yeah, what... in her area.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.652
Well, if my information
is correct,

17:30.685 --> 17:32.386
this is gonna make
for a really nice story.

18:01.448 --> 18:03.718
Kid, it seems like
a little bit of a stretch.

18:03.751 --> 18:06.386
Oh, come on, you have to admit
it sounds really fishy.

18:07.454 --> 18:10.925
Again, we have a witness saying
that he was there every day

18:10.958 --> 18:14.561
until the day
the girl went missing.

18:14.594 --> 18:16.864
And then no one seen him since.

18:16.898 --> 18:18.666
On top of that
I have a quote on record

18:18.700 --> 18:20.835
from his dispatcher saying
that he hasn't called out

18:20.868 --> 18:22.970
in four years of working there

18:23.004 --> 18:24.639
And should that be enough?

18:24.672 --> 18:26.607
Well, it is for me.

18:32.345 --> 18:35.382
Listen,
it's not like we accused the guy.

18:35.415 --> 18:37.517
He went missing.

18:37.551 --> 18:39.987
It doesn't mean he's guilty

18:40.021 --> 18:42.422
or has anything
to do with the girl.

18:42.456 --> 18:45.760
But why nobody bothered
to make the connection?

18:45.793 --> 18:48.462
Why nobody bothered
to investigate it?

18:48.495 --> 18:51.799
Because nobody gives a fuck,
that's why.

18:51.833 --> 18:53.000
We put it out there

18:53.034 --> 18:56.804
and then it'll open us up to
a lot of follow-up articles.

18:56.838 --> 18:59.406
All we have to do
is give the Department

18:59.439 --> 19:02.476
good enough reason
to investigate the case.

19:09.549 --> 19:11.485
Okay, fuck it, let's run it.

19:49.624 --> 19:51.993
Mhmm, yeah.

19:52.026 --> 19:53.661
Alright, okay.

19:53.694 --> 19:54.896
I'm just finishing up.

19:54.929 --> 19:56.664
Okay, bye.

19:59.533 --> 20:01.501
So this is it?

20:01.535 --> 20:02.703
I should say so.

20:07.842 --> 20:09.043
That family is in
for a big surprise

20:09.076 --> 20:10.410
tomorrow morning, huh?

20:12.079 --> 20:13.114
Jesus, if I was them,

20:13.147 --> 20:15.448
I'd hate to find out
about this from a newspaper.

20:16.449 --> 20:18.019
Yeah, well, I'm on my way out.

20:18.052 --> 20:20.520
- See you tomorrow.
- Have a good night.

20:31.065 --> 20:31.732
Oh!

20:31.766 --> 20:33.500
I see, I won't be home in time.

20:34.802 --> 20:36.469
Okay.

20:36.503 --> 20:39.106
Well, put her on the phone,
I wanna talk to her.

20:39.140 --> 20:40.641
Okay, thank you.

20:51.085 --> 20:52.452
Hi, sweetie.

20:53.888 --> 20:55.690
I know, mom told me.

20:57.091 --> 20:59.126
But honey,
that's no reason to fight.

20:59.961 --> 21:01.896
Different people
have different ideas.

21:01.929 --> 21:03.764
That makes it special.

21:05.199 --> 21:07.134
Evans and I have
lots of different ideas,

21:07.168 --> 21:09.136
but we don't fight.

21:09.170 --> 21:10.071
Yeah.

21:11.172 --> 21:13.074
Hey, how's your tummy?

21:14.609 --> 21:15.843
Oh, good.

21:15.877 --> 21:16.911
I'm glad.

21:18.445 --> 21:19.714
No, not tonight,

21:19.747 --> 21:21.916
but I'll wake up you
in the morning, okay?

21:21.949 --> 21:23.550
I'll get you set for school.

21:24.719 --> 21:25.686
Alright.

21:25.720 --> 21:27.922
I love you, too, honey.

21:27.955 --> 21:30.124
Sweet dreams.

21:30.157 --> 21:32.159
Put momma back
on the phone, please.

21:34.594 --> 21:37.064
So put momma back on the phone,
you goofball.

21:38.099 --> 21:39.934
Alright.

21:39.967 --> 21:41.401
I love you, too.

21:43.137 --> 21:44.906
Okay.

21:44.939 --> 21:45.873
Hey, honey.

21:46.774 --> 21:49.777
Ah, she is fine,
she just wanted to talk to me.

21:51.879 --> 21:53.480
I gotta go.

21:53.513 --> 21:54.715
I gotta go.

21:54.749 --> 21:56.617
Bye, hon.

21:56.651 --> 21:57.685
Ortega!

21:58.686 --> 21:59.787
Don't run.

22:01.656 --> 22:03.024
Please don't run.

22:05.726 --> 22:06.493
Ugh.

22:06.526 --> 22:08.129
What have I just
fucking told you?

22:08.162 --> 22:09.664
You motherfucker!

22:10.898 --> 22:12.465
Ortega!

22:12.499 --> 22:14.135
Fucking asshole.

22:27.248 --> 22:31.152
Our Father who art in Heaven...

22:32.620 --> 22:33.421
I don't...

22:33.486 --> 22:34.922
Halloed be thy name,
thy kingdom...

22:34.956 --> 22:36.657
I don't know
what else to say to you.

22:36.691 --> 22:37.524
Will be done.

22:37.557 --> 22:38.993
I don't know if you are
even listening.

22:39.026 --> 22:40.628
...as it is in heaven.

22:40.661 --> 22:41.528
Give us this day
our daily bread.

22:41.561 --> 22:43.731
God, I have nothing to offer
in return.

22:43.764 --> 22:44.564
Forgive us our trespasses,

22:44.597 --> 22:45.598
as we forgive those
who trespass...

22:45.633 --> 22:46.767
So I surrender.

22:46.801 --> 22:49.136
Lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil.

22:49.170 --> 22:50.938
All I know is
I just can't quit on her.

22:50.972 --> 22:52.539
...thine is the Kingdom.

22:52.572 --> 22:53.975
She's the light of my eyes.

22:54.008 --> 22:54.809
...and the glory.

22:54.842 --> 22:56.744
God, please, why her?

22:56.777 --> 22:57.845
Give us this day
our daily bread. And...

22:57.878 --> 22:58.913
I can't understand.

22:58.946 --> 23:01.248
Please, I beg you,
please, please,

23:01.282 --> 23:02.984
bring her back.

23:03.017 --> 23:04.517
Forgive us our trespasses
as we forgive those

23:04.551 --> 23:05.720
who trespass against us.

23:05.753 --> 23:06.787
Forever and ever.

23:08.723 --> 23:09.657
Amen.

23:13.260 --> 23:14.729
Mrs. Watson.

23:18.132 --> 23:21.568
I'm... I'm Christian Baker
from <i>The Chronicle</i>.

23:21.602 --> 23:22.803
Mr. Baker, I'm sorry,

23:22.837 --> 23:25.139
but this is not a good time
for us to talk.

23:25.172 --> 23:27.008
My family is under
a lot of pressure right now.

23:27.041 --> 23:28.009
I just can't...

23:28.042 --> 23:29.777
Well, hey, it's just gonna take
a few minutes.

23:29.810 --> 23:32.146
I'm reporting on how the police
are handling your case.

23:33.214 --> 23:35.082
Nobody is helping us.

23:35.116 --> 23:37.184
Nobody knows anything.

23:37.218 --> 23:39.620
The cops came around,
they searched the building,

23:39.653 --> 23:41.055
and then they just
stopped coming.

23:41.088 --> 23:43.290
The newspapers just ask
the same questions.

23:43.324 --> 23:44.591
I understand.

23:44.625 --> 23:45.893
I might be able to help.

23:46.694 --> 23:48.162
I have a couple of things
that are just...

23:48.195 --> 23:49.330
I needed to talk to you about.

23:49.363 --> 23:50.664
It won't take long.

23:50.698 --> 23:52.066
But I can't do it out here.

23:57.638 --> 23:58.706
It's okay?

24:02.910 --> 24:04.812
You can uh, you can sit here.

24:08.816 --> 24:10.851
Now, we don't have any
hard evidence,

24:10.885 --> 24:13.788
but I... I found a lead
on a suspect

24:13.821 --> 24:16.290
that the cops don't know about.

24:16.323 --> 24:19.193
And my newspaper is gonna
publish an article about it

24:19.226 --> 24:21.128
tomorrow morning
and I thought that

24:21.162 --> 24:23.831
your family should know
before it goes out.

24:23.864 --> 24:26.333
Please do not play with
me, Mr. Baker.

24:26.367 --> 24:29.036
Okay, the last thing we need
is false hope.

24:29.070 --> 24:30.204
No, ma'am.

24:30.237 --> 24:32.039
Now, what I can promise you

24:32.073 --> 24:33.641
is that
when the article comes out,

24:33.674 --> 24:37.778
when people take notice,
the police will be forced

24:37.812 --> 24:39.947
to reinvigorate their search.

25:11.078 --> 25:12.246
Hey, Tiff.

25:13.414 --> 25:15.249
I'm home.

25:15.282 --> 25:18.385
Baby,
I'm in here and we have a guest.

25:18.419 --> 25:20.087
Baby, this is Mr. Baker, he...

25:20.121 --> 25:21.989
What the fuck
are you doing in my house?

25:22.823 --> 25:25.059
- Get the fuck out right now!
- Michael!

25:25.092 --> 25:26.393
I know who he is.

25:26.427 --> 25:28.829
I told you to stay away
from my family.

25:28.863 --> 25:29.630
I understand
you're going through...

25:29.663 --> 25:30.865
You don't understand shit.

25:30.898 --> 25:32.233
Michael, this man can help us.

25:32.266 --> 25:35.236
Nobody is helping us, Tiffany.

25:35.269 --> 25:37.438
Now, I don't know why he's here,
but it's not to help.

25:37.471 --> 25:39.874
You tryin' to write a nice piece
about a poor black family

25:39.907 --> 25:41.675
for all the people downtown
to read over

25:41.709 --> 25:43.010
their morning coffee?

25:43.043 --> 25:44.678
Is that what this is?

25:44.712 --> 25:47.181
Man, my daughter is missing

25:47.214 --> 25:48.949
and the police
don't give a damn about it.

25:48.983 --> 25:50.985
Do you care about that?

25:51.018 --> 25:53.921
Does that part of the story
actually interest you, huh?

25:53.954 --> 25:56.690
- I have information.
- Information, huh?

25:56.724 --> 25:57.892
Why don't you take
your information

25:57.925 --> 26:00.761
and get the fuck
out of my apartment?

26:00.794 --> 26:01.962
Baby?

26:01.996 --> 26:03.731
Michael?

26:03.764 --> 26:04.633
Get the fuck out!

26:04.665 --> 26:05.833
Can you please calm down,
Mr. Watson?

26:05.866 --> 26:06.901
- I'm just trying to help.
- Don't tell me to calm down.

26:06.934 --> 26:07.501
I'll calm down when you
get the fuck out of here.

26:07.535 --> 26:09.136
Baby, please!

26:09.170 --> 26:09.703
Please.

26:09.737 --> 26:11.472
What if he can help us?

26:11.505 --> 26:12.673
Please, Michael.

26:19.446 --> 26:20.347
Look.

26:23.951 --> 26:27.688
I need you to understand that
we are in hell.

26:30.424 --> 26:32.026
Do you get
what I'm saying here?

26:33.861 --> 26:35.396
My daughter is missing

26:35.429 --> 26:37.298
and you know
what the police did about it?

26:39.366 --> 26:42.970
They knocked on couple of doors,
walked through the building,

26:43.003 --> 26:44.305
and then they left.

26:44.338 --> 26:46.140
That is the help we got.

26:46.173 --> 26:49.043
I... I... I guess they got
better shit to do, right?

26:51.345 --> 26:53.514
My son, he can't even go
to school anymore,

26:53.547 --> 26:56.317
because he keeps having
panic attacks.

26:56.350 --> 26:58.953
We don't need
any more reporters,

26:58.986 --> 27:01.222
because it's not gonna get me
a single step closer

27:01.255 --> 27:03.290
to holding my little girl
in my arms.

27:10.231 --> 27:12.199
I'm tired, man.

27:14.535 --> 27:16.870
And I'm scared.

27:22.576 --> 27:24.345
She was so brimming.

27:28.282 --> 27:30.884
She was my everything, man.

27:30.918 --> 27:32.886
You ever have everything
and no money

27:32.920 --> 27:36.390
where all you wanna do
is come home to your family

27:36.423 --> 27:39.526
and that was all you needed,
and then all of a sudden

27:39.560 --> 27:41.929
somethin' comes
and rips your heart out?

27:41.962 --> 27:44.064
Do you have any idea
what that's like?

27:44.098 --> 27:45.866
And then you wonder,
you walk the street

27:45.899 --> 27:47.034
and every child you see

27:47.067 --> 27:49.036
and every little
child's voice you hear,

27:49.069 --> 27:51.038
you think just maybe
it might be your little girl?

27:51.071 --> 27:53.340
Do you have any idea
what that's like?

27:53.374 --> 27:54.475
Do you?

27:58.545 --> 28:01.015
So what are you gonna do
about it, huh?

28:01.048 --> 28:02.383
You're right, Mr. Watson.

28:04.051 --> 28:06.287
The police don't give a damn
about your daughter.

28:08.289 --> 28:10.457
But I might be the only person
who can make 'em.

28:19.900 --> 28:21.368
Now... now I'm listenin'.

28:31.278 --> 28:32.880
Hey, Mike.

28:32.913 --> 28:34.915
Today's paper.

29:22.129 --> 29:26.033
Father,
we come to you right now just thanking you

29:26.701 --> 29:28.936
for everything that
you've done for us.

29:35.509 --> 29:38.078
And make sure she is okay.

29:39.346 --> 29:41.014
She is safe.

29:46.621 --> 29:50.457
And she is warm,
and she's happy.

29:50.491 --> 29:51.558
Please.

29:53.560 --> 29:55.896
That's all I ask of You.

29:57.665 --> 30:01.935
We miss her
and we need her back.

30:07.241 --> 30:09.209
In Your name, we pray.

30:11.178 --> 30:12.680
Amen.

31:47.675 --> 31:48.610
Yeah?

31:49.677 --> 31:51.613
Sam, it's fucking early, man.

31:53.648 --> 31:55.082
Found who?

31:57.317 --> 32:00.287
Yeah, no, I'll meet you...
I'll meet you there.

32:00.320 --> 32:02.055
I'm... I'm leaving now.

32:14.669 --> 32:16.537
- Yo.
- Hey, boss.

32:16.570 --> 32:18.105
Have you seen this little girl?

32:19.273 --> 32:20.574
You mind taking a flyer?

32:20.608 --> 32:21.441
No, I gotta run, man.

32:21.475 --> 32:23.410
No, come on, man,
it's my daughter.

32:23.443 --> 32:24.746
Haven't seen
her, I swear to God.

32:24.779 --> 32:25.780
Just... just... come on...

32:25.813 --> 32:27.281
Just in case.

32:28.716 --> 32:30.417
Hey, just take a look, man.

32:30.450 --> 32:32.119
I uh...

32:32.152 --> 32:34.121
Maybe your neighbors know.

32:39.526 --> 32:41.763
My colleague, Christian and I,
wrote the story, Mr. Baker.

32:41.796 --> 32:42.630
We work at <i>The Chronicle</i>.

32:42.664 --> 32:44.231
- Baker?
- Yeah, that's right, Mr. Baker.

32:44.264 --> 32:45.332
Sounds familiar.

32:45.365 --> 32:46.768
Sam Perkins.
We work at <i>The Chronicle</i>.

32:46.801 --> 32:47.602
I really hope
you find her, because this is a...

32:47.635 --> 32:49.236
- I hope...
- ...it's a tragedy.

33:01.248 --> 33:02.617
- Christian!
- Yeah, what's going on?

33:02.650 --> 33:04.284
Hey.

33:04.318 --> 33:05.152
Okay, is he in yet?

33:05.185 --> 33:06.587
No, he's not in yet.

33:08.221 --> 33:10.390
Well, have you heard anything?

33:10.424 --> 33:11.626
That's him.

33:15.562 --> 33:17.331
Get back!

33:17.364 --> 33:18.398
People move back!

33:18.432 --> 33:20.133
Move back!

33:20.167 --> 33:21.603
When did they
bring you in for questioning?

33:21.636 --> 33:22.837
Yeah, where is the girl?

33:22.870 --> 33:23.838
When did they
bring you in for questioning?

33:23.871 --> 33:25.073
Just uh, move back.

33:25.105 --> 33:27.407
When did they
bring you in for questioning?

33:27.441 --> 33:28.575
Do you know where the girl is?

33:28.610 --> 33:30.410
Are there
any charges at this point?

33:31.411 --> 33:32.680
Everyone stand back.

33:32.714 --> 33:33.748
Back off.
Back off.

34:00.942 --> 34:02.710
Go on.

34:02.744 --> 34:04.578
It was just insane.

34:04.612 --> 34:06.380
I couldn't believe
what I was seeing.

34:06.413 --> 34:07.314
Hmm.

34:07.347 --> 34:10.852
This was like people yelling,
screaming.

34:10.885 --> 34:13.721
The car was halfway up
on the sidewalk.

34:16.691 --> 34:19.526
And she's in the hospital
fighting for her life.

34:19.559 --> 34:21.428
It's okay, Marco.

34:21.461 --> 34:24.398
You did good, you did very good.

34:24.431 --> 34:25.700
Thank you for sharing.

34:32.539 --> 34:34.541
Mr. Watson?

34:34.574 --> 34:35.777
No.

34:42.817 --> 34:44.384
Freddy, welcome back.

34:44.418 --> 34:45.720
Thank you.

34:49.456 --> 34:52.259
So what's going on in there?

34:52.292 --> 34:54.294
We're cracking him, Captain.

34:54.327 --> 34:55.963
He's soft, soft as shit.

34:55.997 --> 34:57.031
Now listen,

34:57.065 --> 34:59.667
fucking press called us out
by finding this guy.

34:59.701 --> 35:01.969
They are making it look like
we are not doing our jobs.

35:02.003 --> 35:04.404
So if this is the guy,
let's pin him quick

35:04.438 --> 35:06.908
and let's wrap this thing up.

35:06.941 --> 35:10.945
And if he's not the guy,
you make him the guy, hmm?

35:10.978 --> 35:12.814
I did not do anything.

35:12.847 --> 35:13.981
I'm innocent.

35:14.015 --> 35:15.983
Please, you have to believe me.

35:16.017 --> 35:17.384
Can you picture?

35:18.585 --> 35:20.822
I mean picture yourself,

35:20.855 --> 35:23.390
walking out the front door
of this station.

35:24.524 --> 35:26.694
You think you can go back
to your job?

35:28.295 --> 35:32.033
Nobody out there cares
what you think you did

35:32.066 --> 35:33.567
or didn't do.

35:33.601 --> 35:36.604
All of New York City
is looking at you.

35:37.905 --> 35:40.307
Every single person.

35:40.340 --> 35:43.443
They all know that you took
that poor,

35:43.477 --> 35:48.315
innocent, little girl
and had your way with her.

35:48.348 --> 35:49.984
I... I did not.

35:50.017 --> 35:51.986
I promise,
I did not do anything.

35:52.019 --> 35:54.454
Plead temporary insanity.

35:54.488 --> 35:56.523
Induced by alcohol abuse.

35:56.556 --> 35:58.525
That's not a bad defense.

35:58.558 --> 36:01.028
I don't care. You get somebody.

36:01.062 --> 36:03.931
That is unless you want
a fuck ton of monkey screaming

36:03.965 --> 36:06.934
in that zoo they call
"the hood" out there.

36:08.836 --> 36:10.638
- You understand me?
- And I don't want that.

36:10.671 --> 36:11.806
No, sir.

36:11.839 --> 36:13.473
I have enough headaches.

36:14.341 --> 36:17.879
So get back in there
and break him down.

36:17.912 --> 36:19.781
Get creative.

36:19.814 --> 36:22.415
Improvise motherfucker,
improvise.

36:23.951 --> 36:25.720
I drink a lot, too.

36:25.753 --> 36:28.089
And the fucked-up part about is
sometimes my memory gets

36:28.122 --> 36:30.423
a little foggy, you know?

36:30.457 --> 36:32.026
Your memory every get foggy?

36:32.059 --> 36:33.426
I... I don't know.

36:33.460 --> 36:35.062
- You ever black out?
- No.

36:35.096 --> 36:36.831
You don't think maybe you...
you blacked out

36:36.864 --> 36:39.934
and you maybe did something
you wouldn't normally do.

36:39.967 --> 36:42.369
Something involving
a little girl?

36:42.402 --> 36:43.805
Please, this is not right
what is happening.

36:43.838 --> 36:45.405
This is not right.

36:54.849 --> 36:56.516
And which day was that?

36:56.550 --> 36:58.552
Forgotten to mention it before.

37:00.087 --> 37:01.789
See, see, see...

37:01.823 --> 37:03.925
I've seen the girl before,
but I did not know her.

37:03.958 --> 37:05.026
You have seen the girl?

37:05.059 --> 37:06.194
Yes.

37:06.227 --> 37:08.595
Before you were saying that
you didn't know anything,

37:09.864 --> 37:10.698
but you have been watching her.

37:10.731 --> 37:12.967
No, no, no, no.
Not at all, not at all.

37:13.000 --> 37:17.504
See, I park my car
in the same spot every morning.

37:17.537 --> 37:19.807
And you watch Monique Watson
walk by!

37:19.841 --> 37:20.975
No, I don't watch her.

37:21.008 --> 37:22.509
I see her walk to school
sometimes.

37:22.542 --> 37:23.376
That's it.

37:23.410 --> 37:24.477
- I don't watch her...
- Nah, ah, ah.

37:24.511 --> 37:25.313
I'll... I'll tell you...
I'll tell you what you did.

37:25.345 --> 37:26.546
I know exactly
how this went down.

37:26.580 --> 37:27.648
No.

37:27.682 --> 37:30.885
You watched that little girl
every day for a month.

37:30.918 --> 37:33.120
- You learned her routine.
- No.

37:33.154 --> 37:35.488
You couldn't wait for
her to walk by in the morning.

37:35.522 --> 37:37.024
And then the day
finally arrived,

37:37.058 --> 37:39.994
you got your phony alibi
all squared away.

37:40.027 --> 37:43.597
And you waited for her
to show up, you fucking monster!

37:43.631 --> 37:45.132
You told her you have something
to show her.

37:45.166 --> 37:46.968
Like we all know
she's a little girl

37:47.001 --> 37:48.468
and you seem like
a nice enough guy.

37:48.501 --> 37:50.171
So why wouldn't she follow you?

37:50.204 --> 37:52.106
- Where did you take her?
- I did not touch her.

37:52.139 --> 37:53.908
I did not touch her,
I did not.

37:53.941 --> 37:55.910
I did not do anything,
I promise.

37:55.943 --> 37:59.412
I did not do anything,
I promise, I promise.

37:59.446 --> 38:01.148
- I promise.
- Are you fucking crying?

38:01.182 --> 38:02.917
No, no.

38:02.950 --> 38:05.485
Are you fucking crying?

38:05.518 --> 38:07.722
I have seen the girl before,
but I did not know.

38:07.755 --> 38:09.422
Yeah,
no shit you've seen the girl,

38:09.456 --> 38:10.958
you sick piece of shit.

38:10.992 --> 38:12.894
How did it feel to grab her...

38:12.927 --> 38:14.461
take her way? Huh?

38:14.494 --> 38:16.764
Did it feel like you were doing
the right thing?

38:16.797 --> 38:17.732
I did not do...

38:17.765 --> 38:19.934
I hope you like getting fucked
in the ass,

38:19.967 --> 38:21.636
because that's exactly
what's gonna happen

38:21.669 --> 38:24.471
when your skinny ass
gets locked up.

38:24.504 --> 38:27.174
We have you on record saying
you were following her.

38:27.208 --> 38:29.176
Might as well tell us the rest!

38:31.078 --> 38:34.782
And maybe...
maybe we can cut you a deal.

38:34.815 --> 38:36.150
Hmm?

38:36.183 --> 38:37.618
What do you say?

38:37.652 --> 38:38.686
I... I never said that.

38:38.719 --> 38:40.021
I never said that,
I didn't.

38:40.054 --> 38:42.156
Are you calling me a liar, huh?

38:42.189 --> 38:43.090
Say it again!

38:43.124 --> 38:44.959
Call me a liar, huh?

38:44.992 --> 38:46.127
- You say it again, huh!
- Cannot breathe.

38:46.160 --> 38:47.560
Hey, hey.
Easy, easy!

38:47.594 --> 38:48.996
- Cannot breathe.
- You ain't nothing.

38:49.030 --> 38:49.964
- Easy!
- You ain't nothing!

38:49.997 --> 38:50.998
- Take it easy.
- You hear me?

38:51.032 --> 38:52.233
You are no-fucking body.

38:52.266 --> 38:55.636
Nobody!

39:26.300 --> 39:29.236
Sir, I finally got a hold
of the rehab center.

39:29.270 --> 39:31.038
Guy's alibi checks out.

39:31.072 --> 39:32.673
Shit, give me that.

39:35.542 --> 39:40.047
His checking date is the day
before the girl disappeared.

39:40.081 --> 39:41.581
You sure this is legit?

39:41.615 --> 39:42.582
The receptionist sent it

39:42.616 --> 39:43.985
and in fact Dr. Bolt confirmed
he was there.

39:44.018 --> 39:45.953
You gotta be fucking kidding me.

40:03.771 --> 40:05.039
Fuck!

40:21.922 --> 40:23.991
<i>He had
likely already passed away</i>

40:24.025 --> 40:26.593
<i>before he was removed
from the police station.</i>

40:26.627 --> 40:27.862
<i>And now
we go to a press release</i>

40:27.895 --> 40:30.731
<i>at the rehabilitation center
that Yann Abelard was attending</i>

40:30.765 --> 40:33.034
<i>days prior to his apprehension
by the police.</i>

40:33.067 --> 40:35.803
<i>I would personally
like to offer my deepest condolences</i>

40:35.836 --> 40:37.772
<i>to Mr. Abelard's family.</i>

40:37.805 --> 40:39.974
<i>In the little experience
I had with him,</i>

40:40.007 --> 40:42.109
<i>he struck me as a good man.</i>

40:42.143 --> 40:45.246
<i>We have no further statement
at this time.</i>

40:50.785 --> 40:52.720
I fucked this up.

40:52.753 --> 40:54.321
You gotta let me make it right.

40:54.355 --> 40:57.258
We fucked this up
and we can't make it right.

40:57.291 --> 40:59.260
We just have to ride it out.

41:00.728 --> 41:02.163
Go home.

41:02.196 --> 41:03.931
Lay low for a while.

41:03.964 --> 41:05.766
If this blows over,

41:05.800 --> 41:07.301
I'll put you back
as soon as I can.

41:07.334 --> 41:08.936
If this blows over?

41:11.238 --> 41:12.572
If it blows over.

42:16.203 --> 42:16.837
You know what I'm saying?

42:16.871 --> 42:18.272
Like he's really interested.

42:18.305 --> 42:19.206
Jesus, man.

42:20.808 --> 42:22.143
Yo.

42:22.176 --> 42:23.878
- Did you...
- Come on, bro.

43:24.205 --> 43:25.372
Who is it?

43:28.075 --> 43:30.411
Mrs. Watson?

43:30.444 --> 43:32.079
It's Christian Baker.

43:33.781 --> 43:35.316
I need to talk to you.

43:39.920 --> 43:42.089
I can't, Mr. Baker.

43:42.122 --> 43:44.091
Please leave before my husband
comes home.

43:44.124 --> 43:45.793
He's real upset.

43:45.826 --> 43:47.428
I know that I might've made
a mistake,

43:47.461 --> 43:50.331
but your daughter
is still out there

43:50.364 --> 43:52.366
and someone has to find her.

43:54.835 --> 43:56.337
I have a friend
inside the police department

43:56.370 --> 43:57.972
that will help.

44:04.211 --> 44:06.280
Mrs. Watson, please.

44:10.150 --> 44:12.019
That man is dead, Mr. Baker.

44:13.554 --> 44:15.189
Please,
we don't wanna involve ourselves

44:15.222 --> 44:16.991
in anybody else's tragedies.

44:19.059 --> 44:20.995
We just want our daughter back.

44:22.830 --> 44:25.432
Please just leave
before my husband comes home.

44:27.868 --> 44:29.336
Just go.

44:38.912 --> 44:43.217
Days like this get me wondering,
you know?

44:43.250 --> 44:46.053
You ever think maybe
we're not doing the right thing?

44:46.086 --> 44:46.954
That's your first mistake.

44:46.987 --> 44:49.523
I mean, you tell me
if this is right.

44:49.556 --> 44:50.557
A guy is dead.

44:50.591 --> 44:53.994
Sorry, an innocent guy is dead.

44:54.028 --> 44:56.997
An innocent guy is dead
and this girl is still missing.

44:59.199 --> 45:00.868
Fuck outta here.

45:00.901 --> 45:02.870
You are not going wobbly on me.

45:02.903 --> 45:05.172
No, I'm just thinking,

45:05.205 --> 45:07.441
wondering if maybe
we went too far?

45:07.474 --> 45:08.942
Too far?

45:08.976 --> 45:10.044
No.

45:12.880 --> 45:13.981
Well...

45:15.449 --> 45:17.918
I don't know about that.

45:17.951 --> 45:20.287
How in the world is this fair?

45:20.321 --> 45:22.791
- Fair for who?
- Exactly my point.

45:25.292 --> 45:26.960
We went too far, man.

45:28.362 --> 45:30.264
Way too far.

45:30.297 --> 45:33.300
Yeah, well, what if we didn't
and this was the guy?

45:33.334 --> 45:37.404
The problem is he's not
the fucking guy!

45:37.438 --> 45:38.872
That's the problem!

45:45.379 --> 45:46.547
Okay, fine.

45:46.580 --> 45:48.215
It's a 50/50 proposition.

45:48.248 --> 45:51.285
We might be wrong,
but we're usually right.

45:51.318 --> 45:53.954
If we hesitate,
start catching doubts,

45:53.987 --> 45:56.423
we'll never get the answers
that we're looking for.

45:57.991 --> 45:59.126
The price is the problem.

46:03.364 --> 46:05.466
Everything's got a price.

46:05.499 --> 46:07.501
What costs you is doubt.

46:10.705 --> 46:13.907
I guess you forgot
our first ride together.

46:13.941 --> 46:17.478
I just made detective,
two weeks in the squad.

46:17.511 --> 46:20.682
We caught a bodega robbery
in progress.

46:20.715 --> 46:22.617
Punk could not shoot straight.

46:24.485 --> 46:26.086
I could.

46:26.120 --> 46:28.155
Put two rounds in his belly
and it was over.

46:28.188 --> 46:32.126
But I couldn't stop shaking.

46:32.159 --> 46:33.560
It was just a kid,

46:33.594 --> 46:35.596
maybe I should have done
things different, but...

46:37.732 --> 46:39.433
you came over to me,
you grabbed me,

46:39.466 --> 46:40.567
you shook me hard,
you said,

46:40.602 --> 46:43.270
"Evans,
get it the fuck together."

46:43.303 --> 46:45.372
That kid almost killed us.

46:45.406 --> 46:47.207
He would've hurt
a lot more people

46:47.241 --> 46:48.676
if you hadn't stopped him.

46:48.710 --> 46:50.210
We don't doubt.

46:50.244 --> 46:51.613
We don't look back.

46:51.646 --> 46:53.947
It costs too much.

46:53.981 --> 46:56.350
"Two seconds of doubt
will leave you dead."

46:56.383 --> 46:58.118
That's what you told me.

46:59.754 --> 47:01.288
It's the cost.

47:02.757 --> 47:04.491
The cost is always the problem.

47:07.729 --> 47:10.063
I know your daughter
got you in your head thinking,

47:10.097 --> 47:13.500
but you cannot go wobbly on me.

47:13.534 --> 47:16.270
I'm a human,
I feel for the guy too,

47:16.303 --> 47:18.505
but if you don't go that hard,

47:19.339 --> 47:20.974
how you supposed
to take down the dude

47:21.008 --> 47:22.943
you know is lying to us?

47:26.046 --> 47:27.481
Ain't no shame in the game.

47:28.750 --> 47:30.551
No shame in the game.

48:27.541 --> 48:29.076
My baby.

48:48.663 --> 48:51.799
I just want my baby back.

48:51.833 --> 48:53.500
I want this case closed.

48:53.534 --> 48:55.536
I'm not risking my job,

48:55.569 --> 48:57.739
because some
dumb black little bitch

48:57.772 --> 48:59.607
got lost on her way home.

49:01.208 --> 49:04.578
So you hit the family
and you hit them hard.

49:06.380 --> 49:08.215
Here you go.

49:08.248 --> 49:10.083
- Egg?
- Yeah.

49:10.117 --> 49:11.084
Good.

49:13.855 --> 49:15.857
What's wrong, man?

49:15.890 --> 49:17.825
Everything about this case,
that's what's wrong.

49:17.859 --> 49:20.662
If you want to know,
there you have it.

49:20.695 --> 49:22.664
Man, we already went over this.

49:22.697 --> 49:24.364
Let's just do our job.

49:24.398 --> 49:26.400
Don't get personal.

49:26.433 --> 49:27.534
Don't get personal?

49:27.568 --> 49:29.503
You know, you sound like
the chief.

49:29.536 --> 49:30.838
"Don't take it personally."

49:30.872 --> 49:34.308
Got his voice rattling around
in my head.

49:34.341 --> 49:37.578
Look, what are you upset about?

49:37.612 --> 49:39.379
We already agreed that
we would go over there and to...

49:39.413 --> 49:40.547
No, no man.

49:40.581 --> 49:42.082
You agreed.

49:44.184 --> 49:45.787
I keep trying to tell you stuff
over and over,

49:45.820 --> 49:47.287
but you are not listening.

49:47.321 --> 49:48.188
I don't like it.

49:48.221 --> 49:50.324
It doesn't feel right!

49:50.357 --> 49:51.258
We've got no evidence.

49:51.291 --> 49:52.760
The chief just needs us
to nail somebody.

49:52.794 --> 49:53.293
Anybody.

49:53.327 --> 49:54.829
He doesn't care who.

49:56.563 --> 49:58.432
There's no eyewitness.

49:58.465 --> 50:00.702
We're just trying to save
the chief's fucking ass.

50:00.735 --> 50:02.436
I get it.

50:02.469 --> 50:06.340
But I don't think we should
ignore the possibility.

50:06.373 --> 50:08.710
We never looked at them, right?

50:08.743 --> 50:10.243
You said that.

50:11.445 --> 50:13.180
What if they did have
something to do with it.

50:13.213 --> 50:14.214
If.

50:14.247 --> 50:17.150
Even unintentionally,
but something.

50:17.184 --> 50:20.287
So let's go over there,
see for ourselves

50:20.320 --> 50:22.289
then we can cross it
off the list.

50:22.322 --> 50:24.591
It's just procedure, okay?

50:24.626 --> 50:26.393
Procedure, my ass.

50:27.795 --> 50:29.463
Okay, fine.

50:29.496 --> 50:30.297
But I'm only doing it,

50:30.330 --> 50:32.466
'cause I wanna see it
for myself.

50:32.499 --> 50:33.701
Well, alright.

50:33.735 --> 50:35.837
And no bullshit this time, okay?

50:36.938 --> 50:38.740
We go in there,
yadah-yadah-yadah,

50:38.773 --> 50:40.675
no extra shove.

50:40.708 --> 50:42.476
If we feel the time is right,
we go after the kid.

50:42.509 --> 50:43.811
If it's him, fine.

50:43.845 --> 50:46.648
If it's not, we let him go.

50:46.681 --> 50:48.348
Okay.

50:48.382 --> 50:49.684
Okay.

50:53.320 --> 50:54.454
This is a bagel.

50:55.723 --> 50:58.392
I told him to give you
a white bread.

50:58.425 --> 51:00.193
Then maybe he doesn't like
black people.

51:00.227 --> 51:01.663
Maybe he knew it was for you.

51:01.696 --> 51:02.930
Fuck you.

51:12.339 --> 51:13.507
Andre, baby, get the door.

51:36.698 --> 51:38.331
Morning, son.

51:38.365 --> 51:40.233
Your parents home?

51:40.267 --> 51:41.334
Terrible what happened.

51:41.368 --> 51:44.872
But now we know for sure that
he didn't take her,

51:44.906 --> 51:48.442
so we have to start looking
other places.

51:48.475 --> 51:52.312
So you starting a new search.

51:52.345 --> 51:53.480
It's about time.

51:53.513 --> 51:55.515
Watch your tone.

51:55.549 --> 51:56.450
What?

51:56.483 --> 51:59.453
We didn't have much
to go off of before.

51:59.486 --> 52:01.022
Yann was our strongest lead.

52:01.055 --> 52:02.790
God rest his soul.

52:02.824 --> 52:04.992
He was troubled.

52:05.026 --> 52:06.560
Right, but now he's gone,
rest in peace.

52:06.593 --> 52:08.830
So we are looking
at other possibilities.

52:11.799 --> 52:13.601
You don't...

52:15.368 --> 52:16.503
Man, what is this?

52:16.536 --> 52:18.371
Why is your boy so nervous?

52:20.007 --> 52:22.309
You gotta be kidding me.

52:22.342 --> 52:25.680
My daughter is gone
and we are all on edge.

52:25.713 --> 52:27.048
Is he being serious with this?

52:27.081 --> 52:30.550
Hey, you address me
when you're talking.

52:34.588 --> 52:36.691
Son, do you know
where your sister is?

52:36.724 --> 52:39.392
- I don't know.
- What the fuck is this?

52:39.426 --> 52:40.460
- Michael.
- My daughter is missing

52:40.494 --> 52:42.395
and y'all supposed to be
out there looking for her

52:42.429 --> 52:43.898
and you come in my house,
accusing me.

52:43.931 --> 52:46.299
You show
a little fucking respect.

52:48.002 --> 52:50.772
Calm down
and answer the questions.

52:50.805 --> 52:53.373
Where was your boy the day
she disappeared?

52:53.406 --> 52:55.375
Said he came home early,
did anybody see him?

52:55.408 --> 52:57.344
- This isn't right, Mich...
- You are all fucking tripping!

52:57.377 --> 52:58.311
This is some bullshit.

52:58.345 --> 53:00.648
Brother, tell this man
he being ridiculous.

53:00.681 --> 53:01.983
I'm not your brother.

53:02.016 --> 53:03.618
I don't know where she is.

53:03.651 --> 53:05.620
Boy, you're gonna wanna keep
your voice down.

53:05.653 --> 53:07.487
Why can't you find her?

53:07.521 --> 53:09.791
Why can't they find her?

53:09.824 --> 53:11.859
Mom, why can't they find her?

53:11.893 --> 53:13.060
Andre.

53:14.862 --> 53:15.730
Boy, you need to relax.

53:15.763 --> 53:17.865
- She's not here!
- You need to relax.

53:17.899 --> 53:18.900
She's not... she's not here!

53:18.933 --> 53:21.636
Hey Dre, stop it, I mean it.

53:21.669 --> 53:22.904
Hey, man!
Hey!

53:22.937 --> 53:24.571
Just... just... just calm down,
alright?

53:24.605 --> 53:25.807
I'm very fucking calm.

53:25.840 --> 53:27.074
She's not here, okay!

53:27.108 --> 53:28.575
Listen to your parents, Andre.

53:28.609 --> 53:29.610
Why can't you find her?

53:29.644 --> 53:30.778
You're coming with me.

53:30.812 --> 53:31.779
Try to stay calm.

53:31.813 --> 53:33.648
Show me both hands.

53:33.681 --> 53:34.816
- Oh baby.
- Show me your hands.

53:34.849 --> 53:37.084
Shut up!

53:37.118 --> 53:38.686
Don't do this please.

53:38.719 --> 53:39.319
Come on.

53:39.352 --> 53:40.453
Don't... don't hurt my son.

53:40.487 --> 53:41.689
He didn't do anything, man.

53:41.722 --> 53:43.356
We'll see about that.

53:43.390 --> 53:44.659
Step back.

53:58.072 --> 53:59.774
- Woah, woah, woah, woah.
- I'm sorry, officer,

53:59.807 --> 54:02.677
- my son Andre Watson, he...
- It's fine, have a seat please.

54:02.710 --> 54:05.512
- Do you any information...
- Sit down!

54:05.545 --> 54:06.513
Outside!

54:09.617 --> 54:10.718
Look, how long do you want us
to wait?

54:10.751 --> 54:12.854
You cannot keep my child
all day long.

54:12.887 --> 54:14.856
We're gonna keep him here
as long as we need to, alright?

54:14.889 --> 54:17.058
Sit down.

54:17.091 --> 54:18.860
They better not be hurtin'
my kid, man.

54:18.893 --> 54:20.094
He's fine.

54:20.127 --> 54:21.729
Just sit and wait.

54:23.097 --> 54:24.832
Sit down.

54:25.900 --> 54:27.101
Thank you.

54:31.639 --> 54:33.373
The door please.

54:34.075 --> 54:35.042
The door.

54:35.076 --> 54:36.443
Thank you.

54:39.180 --> 54:41.749
Hey, where's that paper
I had before?

54:41.782 --> 54:43.017
Thanks.

54:44.619 --> 54:46.621
Yo, seriously,
he comes back in here again,

54:46.654 --> 54:47.955
fucking cuff him.

55:22.790 --> 55:24.091
Is it good?

55:24.125 --> 55:25.960
Of course.

55:30.965 --> 55:31.732
Eat.

55:37.138 --> 55:38.139
I'm not hungry, pop.

55:38.172 --> 55:39.674
Eat.

55:47.214 --> 55:48.149
Oh shit.

55:48.182 --> 55:49.549
Bow, where you at?

55:53.621 --> 55:54.689
Okay.

55:54.722 --> 55:56.489
- It's good.
- Okay.

55:56.523 --> 55:57.224
Boom, hurry up.

56:02.595 --> 56:04.131
It didn't kill you.

56:04.165 --> 56:05.766
Not yet.

56:13.274 --> 56:14.809
What is it?
What's happening?

56:14.842 --> 56:16.509
I don't know.

56:26.253 --> 56:27.688
What's happening?

56:27.722 --> 56:29.223
Some cops.

56:31.158 --> 56:32.559
Now they wanna come.

56:32.592 --> 56:34.161
What are they doing?

56:37.131 --> 56:38.699
Why are they in the garbage?

56:43.304 --> 56:44.739
Why they...

57:07.995 --> 57:09.230
Hey!

57:09.263 --> 57:11.232
What's it look like?

57:11.265 --> 57:12.700
There is a homeless here.

57:12.733 --> 57:14.135
Take this man
for questioning inside.

57:27.748 --> 57:28.548
Why are getting in there?

57:28.581 --> 57:29.383
Why are they getting
in the dumpster?

57:29.417 --> 57:31.919
Why are they getting
in the dumpster?

57:31.952 --> 57:32.686
Michael!
Michael!

57:32.720 --> 57:34.587
Who is that?

57:34.622 --> 57:36.290
Is it... is it her?

57:37.358 --> 57:38.059
What is that?

57:38.092 --> 57:39.060
Is that her?

57:39.093 --> 57:39.994
That's not her.

57:40.027 --> 57:42.763
- No.
- No, no, no, no.

58:04.385 --> 58:05.086
Hey, hey.

58:05.119 --> 58:06.821
- Who is that?
- Stand back!

58:06.854 --> 58:08.889
It's our daughter,
it's our daughter!

58:08.923 --> 58:10.057
- Wait here.
- When it's over...

58:10.091 --> 58:11.225
I know!
I know, I know.

58:11.258 --> 58:11.759
It's gonna be alright.

58:11.792 --> 58:13.127
Let us finish this.

58:13.160 --> 58:14.762
Let us finish this.

58:14.795 --> 58:16.363
- Let us finish this.
- My daughter.

58:16.397 --> 58:18.099
I know,
we're gonna get him.

58:19.400 --> 58:21.001
Take it easy.

58:23.838 --> 58:26.373
I wanna see.

58:26.407 --> 58:28.242
I wanna see.

58:31.946 --> 58:33.180
Let us finish this.

58:33.214 --> 58:35.082
- We gotta finish this, man.
- Get off me!

58:35.116 --> 58:36.684
- Get off me!
- Take it easy, man

58:36.717 --> 58:38.319
Get off me!

58:38.352 --> 58:40.621
Get off me...

58:55.102 --> 58:56.137
My baby.

58:56.170 --> 58:57.805
Oh my God!

58:57.838 --> 58:59.440
She's dead.

59:42.416 --> 59:43.884
Stand back.

59:56.497 --> 1:00:00.301
<i>Police say they
found the body of 10-year-old Tiera Reed.</i>

1:00:00.334 --> 1:00:02.770
<i>Tiera went missing
more than eight weeks ago</i>

1:00:02.803 --> 1:00:05.439
<i>from outside her home
in Brooklyn where she was living</i>

1:00:05.472 --> 1:00:08.275
<i>with her grandma

1:00:08.309 --> 1:00:11.145
<i>Her body has been discovered

1:00:11.178 --> 1:00:14.448
<i>a few blocks away

1:00:14.481 --> 1:00:16.417
<i>The search for Monique Watson,</i>

1:00:16.450 --> 1:00:19.253
<i>another missing girl from
Brooklyn, New York continues.</i>

1:00:19.286 --> 1:00:22.823
<i>Monique disappeared
three weeks ago on April 2nd</i>

1:00:22.856 --> 1:00:26.093
<i>and the police are asking

1:00:26.126 --> 1:00:29.763
<i>The authorities believe

1:01:02.463 --> 1:01:04.865
Mr. Watson?

1:01:04.898 --> 1:01:05.833
Michael?

1:01:05.866 --> 1:01:07.101
Michael?

1:01:08.135 --> 1:01:10.037
It's time, Mr. Watson.

1:01:16.377 --> 1:01:18.846
Oh well.

1:01:23.150 --> 1:01:28.889
My... my name is Michael Watson.

1:01:31.458 --> 1:01:34.161
My daughter went missing
20 days ago.

1:01:37.632 --> 1:01:43.570
And uh,
we don't know what happened,

1:01:43.605 --> 1:01:47.107
that's... that's what's
killing me inside.

1:01:48.509 --> 1:01:51.879
Uh, I don't know what else
to do, you know.

1:01:57.017 --> 1:02:02.589
I'm loosing hope and each...
each day that passes, I can...

1:02:02.624 --> 1:02:05.125
I can feel her getting
further away from me.

1:02:05.159 --> 1:02:07.194
I'm losing her by the minute.

1:02:14.401 --> 1:02:16.036
Welcome.

1:02:23.310 --> 1:02:24.511
Welcome.

1:02:28.182 --> 1:02:30.184
Yeah, whatever just uh...

1:02:30.217 --> 1:02:32.453
I would appreciate it.

1:02:32.486 --> 1:02:34.321
Thank you.

1:02:37.024 --> 1:02:39.093
We're gonna have to go
over there.

1:02:39.126 --> 1:02:40.160
Again?

1:02:40.194 --> 1:02:41.395
Yep.

1:02:41.428 --> 1:02:42.363
You ain't got no job.

1:02:42.396 --> 1:02:43.364
You living with your mama.

1:02:43.397 --> 1:02:45.332
And like yo, first of all
look at your hair,

1:02:45.366 --> 1:02:46.367
first of all,
look at your clothes.

1:02:46.400 --> 1:02:47.267
You know what I'm sayin'?

1:02:47.301 --> 1:02:48.202
She followin' me, I'm like,
"Yo Sonny,

1:02:48.235 --> 1:02:51.171
why are your eyebrows look like
you know,

1:02:51.205 --> 1:02:52.106
they running away
from each other?"

1:02:52.139 --> 1:02:54.408
- Bitch was like...
- Hey, man.

1:02:54.441 --> 1:02:56.243
Oh shit, this nigga.

1:02:57.679 --> 1:03:00.080
Oh, shit.

1:03:00.114 --> 1:03:03.050
You've got some big-ass balls
coming to the block.

1:03:03.083 --> 1:03:05.052
You know, people don't like you
too much out here.

1:03:06.453 --> 1:03:08.555
Hey, I'm just trying to fix
what happened.

1:03:08.589 --> 1:03:10.424
You can't fix a dead body,
motherfucker.

1:03:12.727 --> 1:03:13.795
Yo, so she go,

1:03:13.828 --> 1:03:15.996
"Why do you gotta talk
about my eyebrows like that,

1:03:16.029 --> 1:03:16.964
you know I just..."

1:03:16.997 --> 1:03:18.599
Hey man, I just wanna ask you
a question.

1:03:18.633 --> 1:03:20.000
Oh!

1:03:20.033 --> 1:03:21.268
What the fuck's wrong with you,
boy?

1:03:21.301 --> 1:03:22.336
Yo, you fucked his shit out.

1:03:22.369 --> 1:03:23.537
Get the fuck out of here, man.

1:03:26.708 --> 1:03:29.476
Respect much, son.

1:03:29.510 --> 1:03:30.712
Hey you saw my hands right?

1:03:30.745 --> 1:03:32.179
I got the nigga quick.

1:03:32.212 --> 1:03:34.114
I was like pop, nigga.

1:03:34.148 --> 1:03:35.215
I'm lightning, son.

1:03:35.249 --> 1:03:39.953
Hey yo, Floyd. Boom, nigga.
Touched my hands bruh.

1:03:39.987 --> 1:03:41.422
I just need your help.

1:03:41.455 --> 1:03:43.357
Yeah, no shit.

1:03:43.390 --> 1:03:44.992
You know I got a plan, you know
I'm gonna...

1:03:45.025 --> 1:03:45.693
I'm gonna have my own...

1:03:45.727 --> 1:03:47.594
What if it was your sister?

1:03:54.134 --> 1:03:56.236
It's just a couple of minutes,
man.

1:03:58.706 --> 1:04:01.175
Alright, bruh.

1:04:01.208 --> 1:04:03.510
I mean damn shit, nigga,
you can't get no worse.

1:04:17.224 --> 1:04:18.992
Do you know a guy
from the neighborhood

1:04:19.026 --> 1:04:21.261
named Marcus Mitchel?

1:04:21.295 --> 1:04:23.698
I know a lot of people, son.

1:04:23.731 --> 1:04:25.132
A lot, you get me?

1:04:25.165 --> 1:04:25.999
Yeah.

1:04:26.033 --> 1:04:29.102
Well, he's friends with
Andre Watson,

1:04:29.136 --> 1:04:31.639
he's Monique Watson's brother.

1:04:31.673 --> 1:04:33.574
He's kind of a bigger guy.

1:04:33.608 --> 1:04:34.475
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1:04:34.508 --> 1:04:36.176
I know him, yeah.

1:04:36.210 --> 1:04:37.344
I mean that kid
is a knucklehead

1:04:37.377 --> 1:04:38.746
but nah, man,
he ain't no killer.

1:04:38.780 --> 1:04:39.980
You know what I'm saying?

1:04:40.013 --> 1:04:42.349
Did you ever see him around here
with any girls or anything?

1:04:42.382 --> 1:04:43.484
Oh, I've seen him
a couple of times

1:04:43.517 --> 1:04:45.687
with some girls from the block.

1:04:45.720 --> 1:04:48.288
And one of them named was ah,
Keysha.

1:04:49.356 --> 1:04:50.190
Harris.

1:04:50.224 --> 1:04:51.759
I think she go to school
with them kids.

1:04:51.793 --> 1:04:53.060
Keysha.

1:04:54.328 --> 1:04:57.164
Okay, Keysha or Keesha?

1:04:57.197 --> 1:04:58.365
Keysha.

1:04:58.398 --> 1:05:00.334
- Fuck it, man?
- What you can't hear?

1:05:00.367 --> 1:05:01.201
Harris.

1:05:01.235 --> 1:05:02.670
Is anything else?

1:05:02.704 --> 1:05:04.238
That's all I got, bruh.

1:05:24.591 --> 1:05:25.559
Mr. Baker!

1:05:25.592 --> 1:05:26.828
Do I know you?

1:05:26.861 --> 1:05:30.097
Not yet, but we know you.

1:05:30.130 --> 1:05:32.266
Detective Spaulding,
Detective Evans.

1:05:32.299 --> 1:05:34.067
How can I help you, detectives?

1:05:46.547 --> 1:05:48.215
One, two.

1:05:48.248 --> 1:05:50.117
One two, one two.

1:05:50.150 --> 1:05:52.419
Right there.

1:05:52.452 --> 1:05:53.120
That was better.

1:05:53.153 --> 1:05:53.788
Come on.

1:05:53.821 --> 1:05:56.189
One, two.

1:05:56.223 --> 1:05:58.392
So you get it, huh?

1:05:58.425 --> 1:05:59.092
That was good.

1:05:59.126 --> 1:06:00.561
The first one was really good.

1:06:05.733 --> 1:06:08.168
So you were supposed
to be on vacation, right?

1:06:09.436 --> 1:06:10.805
Yeah.

1:06:10.838 --> 1:06:11.706
Thank you.

1:06:22.884 --> 1:06:25.485
You know, Jeff, think
this one's getting to me.

1:06:32.259 --> 1:06:33.493
Look, uh,

1:06:35.395 --> 1:06:38.398
you're a grown man
and I can't tell you what to do,

1:06:39.667 --> 1:06:41.669
but I'm gonna tell you
what to do anyway.

1:06:42.904 --> 1:06:45.740
You gotta back off this story.

1:06:45.773 --> 1:06:48.408
I mean look at your face,
for Christ's sake.

1:06:51.244 --> 1:06:53.413
I mean if you don't stop,
this whole thing could be

1:06:53.447 --> 1:06:55.817
a huge kick in the balls
for you.

1:07:00.622 --> 1:07:03.323
Yeah, maybe.

1:07:03.357 --> 1:07:05.592
You know, you're acting
a little bit crazy here.

1:07:05.627 --> 1:07:07.394
You know that, right?

1:07:09.196 --> 1:07:09.864
You're right.

1:07:09.897 --> 1:07:11.365
You know, I should back off.

1:07:11.398 --> 1:07:12.232
You're right.

1:07:12.265 --> 1:07:14.167
You're damn right, I'm right.

1:07:14.201 --> 1:07:16.136
You're not supposed to be
a problem solver.

1:07:17.605 --> 1:07:19.439
You're an observer.

1:07:19.473 --> 1:07:20.875
You watch and you write.

1:07:20.908 --> 1:07:22.877
Stay out of it.

1:07:41.863 --> 1:07:43.230
Keysha?

1:07:44.932 --> 1:07:47.267
Keysha, hi.

1:07:47.300 --> 1:07:48.670
Do I know you?

1:07:48.703 --> 1:07:49.536
Well, no.

1:07:49.569 --> 1:07:50.738
But I'm Christian Baker.

1:07:50.772 --> 1:07:52.506
I just wondered if I could
ask you a couple of questions

1:07:52.539 --> 1:07:54.274
about your ex-boyfriend, Marcus.

1:07:54.307 --> 1:07:56.443
I'm just writing
a silly little story

1:07:56.476 --> 1:07:58.613
about high school relationships.

1:07:58.646 --> 1:08:01.281
Marcus volunteered for it.

1:08:01.314 --> 1:08:02.817
You know Marcus, right?

1:08:02.850 --> 1:08:06.319
I do know him,
but that don't sound like him.

1:08:06.353 --> 1:08:08.455
Well, it... it's just
a simple set of questions.

1:08:08.488 --> 1:08:10.490
It won't take very long.

1:08:10.524 --> 1:08:11.659
Okay.

1:08:11.693 --> 1:08:12.960
Okay, well.

1:08:12.994 --> 1:08:14.896
Is Marcus a good boyfriend?

1:08:14.929 --> 1:08:16.931
No, that boy is
a fucking asshole.

1:08:18.432 --> 1:08:19.701
Okay.

1:08:19.734 --> 1:08:21.002
Why... why was he an asshole?

1:08:21.035 --> 1:08:22.235
What did he do?

1:08:22.269 --> 1:08:23.938
He's just aggressive.

1:08:24.706 --> 1:08:27.441
Aggressive, what kind of...
I mean...

1:08:27.474 --> 1:08:28.843
Like he's aggressive.

1:08:28.876 --> 1:08:30.712
I don't know what else to say.

1:08:30.745 --> 1:08:32.446
Aggressive, like he hurt you?

1:08:32.479 --> 1:08:34.782
He used to get rough with me
when we was foolin' around

1:08:34.816 --> 1:08:36.918
and one time he went
upside my head

1:08:36.951 --> 1:08:37.985
and I don't fucking
play that shit,

1:08:38.019 --> 1:08:39.586
so I had to cut him off.

1:08:39.620 --> 1:08:41.455
And did you tell anybody
about it?

1:08:41.488 --> 1:08:43.490
Cops or the police maybe.

1:08:43.523 --> 1:08:44.291
To who?

1:08:44.324 --> 1:08:45.525
Do you think anybody gives
a fuck?

1:08:45.559 --> 1:08:46.661
My parents?

1:08:48.528 --> 1:08:49.529
Yeah, right.

1:08:50.765 --> 1:08:52.834
You know what?

1:08:52.867 --> 1:08:55.002
We airing our business
right now?

1:08:55.036 --> 1:08:55.937
Please.

1:08:57.504 --> 1:08:59.539
I think he likes messing
with little girls.

1:09:02.476 --> 1:09:03.343
No, go ahead, please.

1:09:03.376 --> 1:09:04.812
Just tell me what you know.

1:09:07.749 --> 1:09:11.986
My little sister, Briana,
she has a friend, Amber.

1:09:12.019 --> 1:09:14.421
She used to come over
after school all the time.

1:09:16.090 --> 1:09:18.025
I don't know, Marcus used to be
real nice with her

1:09:18.059 --> 1:09:18.893
and I thought it was sweet,

1:09:18.926 --> 1:09:19.660
so I didn't even think
nothing of it,

1:09:19.694 --> 1:09:22.395
but then one day
she came over

1:09:22.429 --> 1:09:25.032
and she was just like
mad scared of him.

1:09:26.601 --> 1:09:27.902
And then she stopped
coming over completely.

1:09:27.935 --> 1:09:29.704
Like I didn't see her again
for months

1:09:29.737 --> 1:09:32.039
until after Marcus and I
broke up.

1:09:32.073 --> 1:09:32.840
Okay.

1:09:32.874 --> 1:09:34.541
You know where they live,
right?

1:09:34.574 --> 1:09:37.845
Um, yeah, they...
they stay on the east side.

1:09:37.879 --> 1:09:40.547
Would you mind
giving me their address?

1:09:40.580 --> 1:09:42.415
Just wanna ask 'em.

1:09:49.624 --> 1:09:52.827
So Amber and your sister,
they go to the same school?

1:09:54.128 --> 1:09:55.997
Yeah, they go right over there.

1:09:57.698 --> 1:09:58.933
The elementary school?

1:09:58.966 --> 1:10:00.400
Mhmm.

1:10:04.404 --> 1:10:05.505
Thank you.

1:10:06.841 --> 1:10:07.374
Whatever.

1:10:07.407 --> 1:10:09.309
Fuck that boy, right?

1:10:12.814 --> 1:10:14.715
Yeah.

1:10:18.085 --> 1:10:18.853
Okay.

1:10:18.886 --> 1:10:22.455
Think, Christian.

1:10:22.489 --> 1:10:26.426
The Watsons are in 4A.

1:10:26.459 --> 1:10:28.963
The Mitchells are in 4B.

1:10:28.996 --> 1:10:30.031
Okay.

1:10:30.064 --> 1:10:31.966
And that dude's in 4C.

1:10:31.999 --> 1:10:34.501
And now, dada, dadada.

1:10:34.534 --> 1:10:37.571
And then 4C, that...
that he was out of town.

1:10:37.605 --> 1:10:39.874
Come on, alright
think, Christian.

1:10:39.907 --> 1:10:41.108
Come on.

1:10:41.142 --> 1:10:42.009
He wasn't home.

1:10:42.043 --> 1:10:43.044
What happened?

1:10:43.077 --> 1:10:43.878
He was out of town.

1:10:43.911 --> 1:10:45.545
Who was home at 3:15?

1:10:45.579 --> 1:10:46.413
What happened?

1:10:46.446 --> 1:10:48.582
Who was home?

1:10:48.616 --> 1:10:54.387
What if she didn't go missing
on the way home?

1:10:54.421 --> 1:10:55.422
Think, Christian,
think, Christian.

1:10:55.455 --> 1:10:56.090
Dadadada.

1:10:56.123 --> 1:10:58.125
What if... come on.

1:10:58.159 --> 1:10:58.693
Christian, think.

1:10:58.726 --> 1:10:59.660
What if she doesn't...

1:10:59.694 --> 1:11:00.862
What if she went missing
when she got home?

1:11:00.895 --> 1:11:02.596
What if... what if she...

1:11:02.630 --> 1:11:03.496
Wait a minute.

1:11:03.530 --> 1:11:04.165
And of course...

1:11:04.198 --> 1:11:05.398
Probably around 3:15.

1:11:05.432 --> 1:11:06.634
Now who would be there?

1:11:06.667 --> 1:11:08.936
Distance from school out there.

1:11:08.970 --> 1:11:10.104
She gets home around 3:15.

1:11:10.137 --> 1:11:11.706
Who would be at home at 3:15?

1:11:11.739 --> 1:11:13.140
He could very well
have been there.

1:11:13.174 --> 1:11:14.976
And he probably talked to her.

1:11:15.009 --> 1:11:17.510
Of course,
she wouldn't be afraid.

1:11:17.544 --> 1:11:19.479
She grew up with Marcus.

1:11:19.512 --> 1:11:20.047
Wait a minute.

1:11:20.081 --> 1:11:21.983
Hold on.

1:11:24.085 --> 1:11:26.654
Fucking son of a bitch.

1:11:26.687 --> 1:11:27.989
Makes sense.

1:11:28.022 --> 1:11:29.924
You, motherfucker.

1:11:51.245 --> 1:11:52.780
Yes.

1:11:54.547 --> 1:11:55.582
Good.

1:12:18.739 --> 1:12:19.407
Yo.

1:12:19.439 --> 1:12:21.175
Somebody just called in a tip.

1:12:21.208 --> 1:12:23.510
He said that you need to go down

1:12:23.543 --> 1:12:25.212
Something about Marcus Mitchell.

1:12:25.246 --> 1:12:27.480
We've been there,
there is nothing to find.

1:13:02.083 --> 1:13:03.483
Hey.

1:13:17.597 --> 1:13:19.599
Goodbye, baby.

1:13:20.301 --> 1:13:22.269
Bye, I love you.

1:13:25.773 --> 1:13:28.609
See you tonight, baby.

1:14:03.744 --> 1:14:05.312
Sorry guys, I gotta go.

1:14:05.346 --> 1:14:06.914
- Bye.
- Bye.

1:14:06.947 --> 1:14:07.848
Call me later.

1:14:07.882 --> 1:14:09.083
Bye, Amber.

1:14:09.116 --> 1:14:10.117
Bye, Amber.

1:14:10.151 --> 1:14:12.019
- Bye!
- Yes, it's great for me.

1:14:13.387 --> 1:14:14.587
Coming tomorrow?

1:14:14.622 --> 1:14:15.322
Duh!

1:14:20.161 --> 1:14:21.594
See ya!

1:14:21.629 --> 1:14:22.963
Bye!

1:14:26.634 --> 1:14:27.134
Hi.

1:14:27.168 --> 1:14:28.135
Amber?

1:14:30.638 --> 1:14:34.175
My name is Christian.
I'm friends with Keysha.

1:14:34.208 --> 1:14:35.910
Rihanna's older sister.

1:15:44.111 --> 1:15:45.746
Thanks for meeting me.

1:15:45.779 --> 1:15:47.748
Shit,
you don't look to good, man.

1:15:48.883 --> 1:15:51.919
Yeah, I got a story for you.

1:15:53.954 --> 1:15:55.356
For real?

1:16:07.268 --> 1:16:09.670
See you later.

1:16:12.506 --> 1:16:15.843
Marcus,
this ain't looking good for you, my man.

1:16:16.544 --> 1:16:19.780
You told us you were at school
the day she disappeared.

1:16:19.813 --> 1:16:22.383
Three of your teachers
said otherwise.

1:16:22.416 --> 1:16:25.419
And now we got these girls.

1:16:25.452 --> 1:16:27.421
These two little girls,

1:16:27.454 --> 1:16:28.422
who both said you did things
to them...

1:16:28.455 --> 1:16:31.392
I don't know what
you're talking about, man.

1:16:31.425 --> 1:16:33.127
And I don't know
where Monique is.

1:16:34.495 --> 1:16:37.264
Something you should know about
Spaulding is that

1:16:37.298 --> 1:16:40.434
he hates niggas.

1:16:41.368 --> 1:16:42.403
I do.

1:16:42.436 --> 1:16:45.239
Spaulding is a bad person.

1:16:45.272 --> 1:16:46.907
I am.

1:16:46.941 --> 1:16:49.276
And you know what he hates
worst then niggas?

1:16:49.310 --> 1:16:51.212
- Liars.
- Mhmm.

1:16:51.245 --> 1:16:52.947
Can't fucking stand 'em.

1:16:53.847 --> 1:16:58.752
So you think to yourself,
think hard, boy.

1:16:59.688 --> 1:17:04.959
What can you imagine happen
if you take a racist, angry nig

1:17:04.992 --> 1:17:06.427
with a badge

1:17:06.460 --> 1:17:09.863
and put him in the back seat
with a lying nigga?

1:17:11.832 --> 1:17:13.767
You get me?

1:17:13.801 --> 1:17:15.803
Listen to me, you little shit.

1:17:15.836 --> 1:17:17.171
We know you have the girl.

1:17:17.204 --> 1:17:19.540
We know you can tell us
where she is.

1:17:19.573 --> 1:17:22.042
You either give her up
or you can start shitting

1:17:22.076 --> 1:17:23.377
out of a bag
for the rest of your life,

1:17:23.410 --> 1:17:24.945
because I'm gonna take you
behind a dumpster

1:17:24.979 --> 1:17:27.548
and shove a two-by-four
up your ass.

1:17:27.581 --> 1:17:29.783
Tell us
where the fucking girl is!

1:17:29.817 --> 1:17:30.551
I don't know, man.

1:17:30.584 --> 1:17:31.819
You're really fucking crazy!

1:17:31.852 --> 1:17:33.053
Get off of me!

1:17:33.087 --> 1:17:35.823
If you really wanna
talk, you gotta trust me, kid.

1:17:35.856 --> 1:17:36.857
It's better if you come clean.

1:17:36.890 --> 1:17:38.292
I told you, bruh, I don't know.

1:17:38.325 --> 1:17:39.293
Get off of me!

1:17:42.963 --> 1:17:45.933
Now you get the fuck
out of my car!

1:17:45.966 --> 1:17:47.801
Yo, y'all are fucking crazy, yo!

1:17:52.873 --> 1:17:53.774
My name is Michael Watson

1:17:53.807 --> 1:17:55.943
and my daughter went missing
23 days ago.

1:18:01.181 --> 1:18:02.349
My name is Michael Watson

1:18:02.383 --> 1:18:04.351
and my daughter went missing
24 days ago.

1:18:07.521 --> 1:18:09.590
My name is Michael Watson

1:18:09.624 --> 1:18:13.560
and my daughter Monique
went missing 25 days ago.

1:18:14.595 --> 1:18:15.496
I am Michael Watson

1:18:15.529 --> 1:18:20.367
and my daughter disappeared
26 days ago.

1:18:39.420 --> 1:18:40.988
Why you got me out here, man?

1:18:41.021 --> 1:18:42.523
What's up?

1:18:42.556 --> 1:18:44.124
I found something out,

1:18:44.158 --> 1:18:46.226
I don't know if I should
tell you or not,

1:18:48.329 --> 1:18:49.463
but I think you should know.

1:18:49.496 --> 1:18:50.497
Please, Christian,

1:18:51.666 --> 1:18:53.434
whatever it is you got
to tell me

1:18:53.467 --> 1:18:55.637
it needs to be helpful.

1:18:55.670 --> 1:18:57.571
It's about Marcus Mitchell.

1:18:59.340 --> 1:19:00.507
Can't be right.

1:19:02.142 --> 1:19:04.211
I think that I have something.

1:19:14.154 --> 1:19:15.856
Michael...

1:19:20.928 --> 1:19:23.130
...I talked with
Marcus' ex-girlfriend

1:19:24.365 --> 1:19:26.433
and a friend
of her little sister's.

1:19:28.636 --> 1:19:31.205
Marcus got violent with her

1:19:34.174 --> 1:19:41.482
and the little girl told me
that he raped her.

1:19:44.686 --> 1:19:46.019
Seriously.

1:19:47.722 --> 1:19:48.922
Can't be right.

1:19:48.956 --> 1:19:50.424
Why would they lie, man?

1:19:51.659 --> 1:19:53.026
You know how kids are.

1:19:53.060 --> 1:19:54.561
They... they say something

1:19:54.595 --> 1:19:56.063
and then they regret it,
you know?

1:19:58.198 --> 1:20:00.100
And you want to accept that?

1:20:02.436 --> 1:20:06.240
Listen to me,
I talked to these girls

1:20:06.273 --> 1:20:08.509
and I believe them 100%.

1:20:09.744 --> 1:20:13.681
I have already gave the names
to the cops,

1:20:13.715 --> 1:20:17.217
they are gonna build
a strong case against him

1:20:17.251 --> 1:20:19.553
and they can probably get him
to confess.

1:20:19.586 --> 1:20:20.954
Sorry, man.

1:20:25.459 --> 1:20:27.629
I really need to go home.

1:20:37.404 --> 1:20:38.740
Where's your boy?

1:20:38.773 --> 1:20:39.808
Is he in there?

1:20:39.841 --> 1:20:42.276
- What's wrong?
- Is he in there?

1:20:42.309 --> 1:20:44.077
He ain't in here, calm down.

1:20:44.111 --> 1:20:45.412
I swear to God,

1:20:45.446 --> 1:20:46.681
if your boy took my girl,
I will...

1:20:46.714 --> 1:20:48.282
Dig that nonsense!

1:20:48.315 --> 1:20:50.718
I want you to
fucking listen to me.

1:20:50.752 --> 1:20:53.086
I want my daughter back.

1:20:53.120 --> 1:20:57.257
And if Marcus or you guys have
anything to do with it...

1:20:57.291 --> 1:21:02.029
Listen to me, man,
I'll fucking kill you.

1:21:02.062 --> 1:21:04.198
You're losing it, Mike!

1:21:04.231 --> 1:21:05.667
Listen to what you're saying!

1:21:36.396 --> 1:21:37.765
Yo, Mr. Watson.

1:21:37.799 --> 1:21:40.067
I know you know where she is.

1:21:40.100 --> 1:21:42.336
I don't know, man, come on,
get off of me.

1:21:42.369 --> 1:21:45.105
If you took my daughter from us
and so help me,

1:21:45.138 --> 1:21:48.141
if you hurt a hair on her head,
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

1:21:50.845 --> 1:21:53.013
I'm gonna fucking kill you, man.

1:22:03.691 --> 1:22:04.759
Fuck, man!

1:22:34.354 --> 1:22:37.090
Ma'am, we have a search warrant
for these premises.

1:22:37.124 --> 1:22:39.192
Please step aside.

1:22:39.226 --> 1:22:41.428
I guess you have the right
to an attorney, too,

1:22:41.461 --> 1:22:44.164
and you better hope
he's a good one, you sick fuck.

1:22:44.197 --> 1:22:45.700
- Fuck you!
- Fuck you!

1:23:16.698 --> 1:23:19.299
Alright everybody,
nothing to see here.

1:23:34.949 --> 1:23:36.851
<i>Now we have
a breaking story in the case</i>

1:23:36.884 --> 1:23:38.720
<i>of a missing local girl.</i>

1:23:38.753 --> 1:23:41.856
<i>Monique Watson disappeared
from her home three weeks ago</i>

1:23:41.889 --> 1:23:44.324
<i>and today the police have
announced a new suspect</i>

1:23:44.358 --> 1:23:46.159
<i>in the unsolved case.</i>

1:23:46.193 --> 1:23:49.831
<i>The family's neighbor,
16-year-old, Marcus Mitchell.</i>

1:23:50.732 --> 1:23:52.366
<i>The police have been
under scrutiny</i>

1:23:52.399 --> 1:23:54.334
<i>since the suicide
of Yann Abelard,</i>

1:23:54.368 --> 1:23:55.903
<i>a taxi driver
who's been questioned</i>

1:23:55.937 --> 1:23:59.473
<i>about the case and took his life
while under custody.</i>

1:23:59.506 --> 1:24:01.274
<i>Marcus Mitchell
attends high school</i>

1:24:01.308 --> 1:24:03.678
<i>with Monique Watson's brother
and his family lives</i>

1:24:03.711 --> 1:24:06.914
<i>in the apartment next door

1:24:06.948 --> 1:24:09.416
<i>Police continues to search
for Monique Watson</i>

1:24:09.449 --> 1:24:11.686
<i>and have asked
for the public's support.</i>

1:24:11.719 --> 1:24:13.487
<i>If you have any information

1:24:13.520 --> 1:24:15.188
<i>Monique Watson's disappearance</i>

1:24:15.222 --> 1:24:18.525
<i>who's been reported missing
on April 2nd...</i>

1:24:32.740 --> 1:24:34.541
You ready to
tell us what happened?

1:24:42.817 --> 1:24:44.551
I skipped school.

1:24:47.254 --> 1:24:51.659
I went to the Watsons' house,
I knocked on the door.

1:25:01.368 --> 1:25:02.837
Monique answered.

1:25:04.972 --> 1:25:06.774
I asked if anybody else is home.

1:25:09.711 --> 1:25:10.778
She said nah.

1:25:13.047 --> 1:25:14.949
Told her my mom needed
to talk to her.

1:25:18.686 --> 1:25:19.887
I took her to my bedroom.

1:25:21.055 --> 1:25:22.924
Told her to take
all her clothes off.

1:25:23.958 --> 1:25:26.393
But she didn't want to, though.

1:25:26.426 --> 1:25:28.495
I could tell
she was really scared.

1:25:29.296 --> 1:25:31.364
She kept promising
not to tell anybody

1:25:31.398 --> 1:25:32.734
if I just let her go.

1:25:33.801 --> 1:25:35.268
I didn't believe that shit
though.

1:25:36.104 --> 1:25:40.540
And I picked her up,
and I put her on my bed,

1:25:42.043 --> 1:25:43.811
and she barely even fought.

1:25:44.979 --> 1:25:47.782
Then my brain started working
real fast,

1:25:47.815 --> 1:25:49.016
I thought,
"Ain't no way she'd be able

1:25:49.050 --> 1:25:50.517
to keep that a secret."

1:25:50.550 --> 1:25:53.453
It was as if somebody else
was doing it.

1:25:53.487 --> 1:25:55.857
Like I was just standing there
watching it happen.

1:25:57.324 --> 1:25:58.291
And I hit her.

1:26:00.494 --> 1:26:01.696
Real hard.

1:26:01.729 --> 1:26:03.363
Boom!

1:26:09.503 --> 1:26:11.271
And I was watching
Tyrell's crib.

1:26:12.640 --> 1:26:14.474
He's my neighbor
and a good buddy of mine.

1:26:15.610 --> 1:26:16.576
He left me his keys,

1:26:16.611 --> 1:26:19.847
so it was easy to put
her inside his apartment

1:26:19.881 --> 1:26:22.817
and after into the storage
next to the body

1:26:22.850 --> 1:26:24.417
of the other girl.

1:26:25.519 --> 1:26:27.420
Nobody knew a thing.

1:26:28.923 --> 1:26:29.957
Every day I wanted to end her,

1:26:29.991 --> 1:26:35.763
but seeing the body
of the other girl, I just...

1:26:35.797 --> 1:26:37.330
I wasn't ready to do it again.

1:26:38.800 --> 1:26:40.768
Just fuck that shit.

1:26:40.802 --> 1:26:42.569
It was funny though.

1:26:42.603 --> 1:26:44.672
I was giving her food and water.

1:26:45.505 --> 1:26:48.475
Took good care of her
like she was my daughter,

1:26:48.508 --> 1:26:49.476
you know?

1:26:50.945 --> 1:26:52.914
I even forgot about the one
in the box.

1:26:58.052 --> 1:27:01.088
Mhmm, the end.

1:27:26.013 --> 1:27:28.049
- Hey.
- Morning, detective.

1:27:28.082 --> 1:27:29.349
What we got here.

1:27:40.862 --> 1:27:44.866
Hello, um,
my name is Michael Watson.

1:27:45.900 --> 1:27:47.001
It's been seven days

1:27:47.034 --> 1:27:49.502
since my daughter Monique
was found.

1:27:50.403 --> 1:27:53.808
It's been the hardest ride
of my life,

1:27:53.841 --> 1:27:55.575
it was like I died,
and went to hell,

1:27:55.610 --> 1:27:57.111
and came back a week ago.

1:27:59.180 --> 1:28:00.715
Every day we spent without her

1:28:00.748 --> 1:28:03.150
made me fall deeper
and deeper into a hole.

1:28:03.184 --> 1:28:08.588
This really dark, cold,
scary pit.

1:28:09.589 --> 1:28:11.491
And I'm embarrassed to say this,

1:28:12.559 --> 1:28:13.995
but I thought
about killing myself

1:28:14.028 --> 1:28:15.897
more than a few times.

1:28:16.898 --> 1:28:21.568
I couldn't see past
any of the madness, you know?

1:28:21.602 --> 1:28:25.172
Even now with my baby girl home,
I still have these...

1:28:26.707 --> 1:28:29.576
these mind trips,
these panic attacks

1:28:29.610 --> 1:28:31.478
when she's not near me,
you know?

1:28:31.511 --> 1:28:35.216
And I wonder if...
if it all really happened

1:28:35.249 --> 1:28:38.052
or if it's just a really,
really bad dream.

1:28:39.020 --> 1:28:42.555
But something, something
inside me kept me going,

1:28:42.589 --> 1:28:43.423
you know?

1:28:44.491 --> 1:28:46.661
My wife says it was God's grace.

1:28:47.929 --> 1:28:48.763
Had to be.

1:28:48.796 --> 1:28:50.898
I, by myself,
I wasn't strong enough.

1:28:52.667 --> 1:28:57.972
When my daughter was safe,
and we were together,

1:28:58.005 --> 1:29:01.976
and I can find her, and breathe.

1:29:04.078 --> 1:29:07.782
I needed to come here tonight
to say thank you

1:29:07.815 --> 1:29:10.483
to each and every one of you
for being here for me.

1:29:11.484 --> 1:29:16.624
You all will always be my rock
and I hope I can be yours, too.

1:29:17.391 --> 1:29:20.861
It's a promise I've made to God
and I'm damn sure will keep it.

1:29:22.997 --> 1:29:24.966
My name is Michael Watson.

1:29:26.734 --> 1:29:28.468
And I have two children.

1:29:29.603 --> 1:29:31.538
My daughter went missing
six weeks ago

1:29:31.571 --> 1:29:33.040
and now she's found.

1:29:35.609 --> 1:29:40.014
And God is good, all the time.

1:29:54.829 --> 1:29:58.265
According to the FBI's
National Crime Information Center,

1:29:58.299 --> 1:30:05.706
there are a total of 465,676
active missing person records.

1:30:06.807 --> 1:30:11.779
I am calling to improve measures
to search for missing children.

1:30:11.812 --> 1:30:16.283
This is not just a Police
Department responsibility,

1:30:16.317 --> 1:30:19.286
it is the people's
responsibility.

1:30:19.320 --> 1:30:21.622
We need to be kind
to one another,

1:30:21.655 --> 1:30:24.992
and we are not separated
as we think.

1:30:25.026 --> 1:30:30.031
Kindness will affect the world
and will help us find

1:30:30.064 --> 1:30:34.201
that common bond that
we are very much searching for.

1:30:34.935 --> 1:30:38.039
Here is to all the kids
that haven't come back home.

1:30:39.807 --> 1:30:41.008
Lisa Irwin.

1:30:42.076 --> 1:30:43.310
Polly Klaas.

1:30:44.612 --> 1:30:45.746
Jessica Lansford.

1:30:46.881 --> 1:30:47.915
Cherrie Mahan.

1:30:49.283 --> 1:30:50.550
Megan Kanak.

1:30:51.786 --> 1:30:53.287
Ethan Alexander.

1:30:54.355 --> 1:30:55.756
Walter Morrison.

1:30:57.024 --> 1:30:58.159
Lili Cosi.

1:30:59.727 --> 1:31:01.095
Peter Spencer.
