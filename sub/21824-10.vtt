WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.001
Previously...

00:03.080 --> 00:04.081
Ian!

00:04.160 --> 00:07.164
I won't set foot
on our shores again without Young Ian.

00:07.240 --> 00:08.321
We will find him.

00:09.120 --> 00:11.964
Fergus. Marsali?
What the hell are ye doing here?

00:12.040 --> 00:13.769
Fergus and I are married.

00:13.840 --> 00:14.841
I am sending you home.

00:14.920 --> 00:16.800
I'll tell everyone
Fergus has already bedded me.

00:16.840 --> 00:18.176
He hasn't, but I'll say it anyway.

00:18.200 --> 00:20.646
I know that you're party
to yer uncle's smuggling.

00:20.720 --> 00:22.722
Where is he hiding the liquor?

00:26.880 --> 00:28.006
They're firing at us.

00:28.640 --> 00:30.404
No, signalling. They mean to board us.

00:30.480 --> 00:32.561
We suffered an outbreak
of infectious plague.

00:32.640 --> 00:34.847
I know what it might be.
It's called typhoid.

00:35.240 --> 00:37.561
I can't catch it. I've been inoculated.

00:37.680 --> 00:40.001
I won't take my eYes
off that ship until you return.

00:41.600 --> 00:44.444
But why are we moving?
Well, you can't just kidnap me like this.

00:44.520 --> 00:46.807
You may be our only chance.
I must take it.

01:17.320 --> 01:19.527
What dealings have you with the cook?

01:21.160 --> 01:24.960
Rose hips, cloves,
lavender and orange peel.

01:25.400 --> 01:26.765
It's a potpourri for Marsali.

01:27.360 --> 01:28.856
It may surprise you, Milord, but our cabin

01:28.880 --> 01:31.486
is beginning to smell
like the ship's bilge.

01:32.920 --> 01:34.524
I thought it might impress her.

01:36.280 --> 01:38.760
Why do I get the feeling
it's me you're trying to impress?

01:43.360 --> 01:44.361
Milord?

01:59.400 --> 02:00.481
Oi! What...

02:00.560 --> 02:02.164
- The Porpoise, she's moving away.
- Aye.

02:02.240 --> 02:04.129
They have hell's own journey ahead of 'em.

02:11.000 --> 02:12.081
They have my wife.

02:12.960 --> 02:14.121
Do we not follow?

02:14.720 --> 02:16.688
Topmen! Away aloft!

02:17.560 --> 02:18.561
Make sail!

02:18.640 --> 02:20.165
Belay that order!

02:20.720 --> 02:21.767
They've taken Claire.

02:21.840 --> 02:24.764
Set main sail only.
Helm a-lee and aim sou'-sou'west.

02:24.840 --> 02:26.251
Aye, Captain. Sou'-sou'west.

02:26.320 --> 02:27.367
That's not enough sail.

02:27.440 --> 02:29.761
It's all the sail
we can safely carry in this wind.

02:29.840 --> 02:31.444
They're getting away, damn you!

02:32.000 --> 02:35.402
The Porpoise is carrying 100 sick,
and more dying every day.

02:35.480 --> 02:38.290
Captain Leonard
requires a surgeon for the duration

02:38.360 --> 02:42.968
and is making headway at full sail
to ensure the shortest possible journey.

02:43.040 --> 02:46.249
He has promised
to deliver her safely to us in Jamaica.

02:46.320 --> 02:47.606
And you agreed to this?

02:48.960 --> 02:50.200
He conveyed a message to me.

02:52.200 --> 02:55.204
When the captain of a 74
asks you for a surgeon,

02:55.320 --> 02:56.481
you give him a surgeon.

02:57.880 --> 03:00.281
I have more than your wife
to think about, Mr Fraser.

03:01.120 --> 03:02.167
My wife...

03:03.000 --> 03:04.001
MY wife!

03:13.600 --> 03:15.921
Tell your men to scabbard their blades.

03:24.760 --> 03:25.761
Do as he says, lads.

03:39.640 --> 03:41.449
Just keep me in sight of her, man.

03:42.080 --> 03:45.243
We'll sail at our own pace, Mr Fraser,
and no faster than is safe.

03:45.920 --> 03:49.367
Mr Warren, restrain Mr Fraser
and take him below.

04:11.040 --> 04:13.566
Sing me a song

04:13.640 --> 04:16.370
Of a lass that is gone

04:16.640 --> 04:19.245
Say, could that lass

04:19.360 --> 04:21.327
Be I?

04:22.000 --> 04:24.128
Merry of soul

04:24.240 --> 04:27.210
She sailed on a day

04:27.280 --> 04:29.487
Over the sea

04:29.560 --> 04:31.244
To Skye

04:32.600 --> 04:34.967
Billow and breeze

04:35.040 --> 04:37.691
Islands and seas

04:37.800 --> 04:41.850
Mountains of rain and sun

04:43.040 --> 04:45.281
All that was good

04:45.360 --> 04:48.125
All that was fair

04:48.200 --> 04:50.202
All that was me

04:50.280 --> 04:52.851
Is gone

04:53.360 --> 04:55.806
Sing me a song

04:55.880 --> 04:58.804
Of a lass that is gone

04:58.880 --> 05:00.644
Say, could that lass

05:01.120 --> 05:02.849
Be I?

05:03.800 --> 05:05.882
Merry of soul

05:05.960 --> 05:09.009
She sailed on a day

05:09.120 --> 05:12.647
Over the sea

05:13.240 --> 05:18.326
To Skye

06:15.760 --> 06:18.206
I need more room
to house the infected men.

06:19.360 --> 06:22.489
Once this deck is clean,
the sick can convalesce here.

06:22.560 --> 06:24.130
Where will the rest of us sleep, then?

06:24.680 --> 06:25.761
Everywhere else.

06:26.160 --> 06:27.889
We need to make use of every inch of space

06:27.960 --> 06:30.042
so that no man sleeps
touching another one,

06:30.160 --> 06:31.161
sick or well.

06:31.800 --> 06:33.609
Every surface must be cleaned.

06:33.680 --> 06:39.210
Typhoid fever is spread by hands or food
contaminated by infected urine or faeces.

06:39.520 --> 06:41.443
Then we'll all die, if you hadn't noticed.

06:41.880 --> 06:42.927
There's shite everywhere.

06:43.520 --> 06:46.285
Thankfully, Mr Jones,
most of this is vomit.

06:47.160 --> 06:48.400
Now let's get to work.

06:49.560 --> 06:51.244
Lady doctor giving me orders.

06:51.320 --> 06:52.321
What was that?

06:55.000 --> 06:56.161
Nothing, sir.

06:56.440 --> 06:57.851
It's Captain's orders, Jones.

06:57.920 --> 07:00.844
You're to do as the doctor says
and pay her every respect.

07:02.080 --> 07:03.081
Yes, sir.

07:09.040 --> 07:11.520
We need to get
more air down here. It's foul.

07:13.040 --> 07:14.371
Thank you, Mr Sullivan.

07:14.800 --> 07:18.327
You mustn't let any man pass in or out
without first dipping his hands.

07:18.640 --> 07:20.165
Why do we dip our hands in grog?

07:20.880 --> 07:22.723
Because we don't have any pure alcohol.

07:27.520 --> 07:28.851
What did you just do?

07:28.920 --> 07:31.605
Just a taste of grog, Madam.
I couldn't see it going to waste.

07:33.560 --> 07:36.848
The alcohol kills contaminants
that spread the fever, Mr Pound.

07:36.920 --> 07:38.736
By dipping your hands in the grog,
you clean them.

07:38.760 --> 07:41.120
But by putting them in your mouth,
you've fouled them again.

07:42.080 --> 07:45.289
Look, if you had the disease,
you could easily spread it to another man

07:45.400 --> 07:48.404
by touching his food
or simply touching his hand.

07:49.800 --> 07:52.849
Look, please, dip them again.

08:09.080 --> 08:11.970
I had been on the Porpoise
for less than a day.

08:12.040 --> 08:15.761
Surely, no more than 50 miles
separated me from Jamie.

08:16.680 --> 08:20.002
And yet,
it felt nearly as far as the 200 years.

08:20.400 --> 08:23.085
Still, I was glad he was not here,

08:23.440 --> 08:26.967
knowing he would not have been safe
from the typhoid raging through the ship.

08:27.600 --> 08:29.443
I've managed to secure you a hat, Madam.

08:30.400 --> 08:31.811
The sun can be very unforgiving.

08:33.200 --> 08:34.201
Thank you.

08:34.280 --> 08:35.976
Would it be helpful, Madam,
if we had someone

08:36.000 --> 08:38.525
as knew how to distil
pure alcohol from rum?

08:40.520 --> 08:42.328
You catch on very quickly, Mr Pound.

08:42.799 --> 08:46.122
We have two men pressed into service
out of the Old Tollbooth in Edinburgh.

08:46.360 --> 08:48.044
Jailed for distilling illicit whiskey.

08:48.520 --> 08:50.363
Shall I put them to work
in building a still?

08:51.080 --> 08:54.289
Well, I think you shall.
Though it won't be a popular decision.

08:55.080 --> 08:58.801
I'll speak with the purser about
putting the men on half rations of grog.

09:08.640 --> 09:09.846
The men won't like it.

09:10.560 --> 09:11.891
Well, would they prefer to die?

09:12.960 --> 09:16.362
That pomander of herbs
won't stave off the fever, Mr Overholt.

09:16.720 --> 09:18.290
But the alcohol just might.

09:18.360 --> 09:21.011
And what's to keep these two slags
from drinking their production?

09:22.160 --> 09:24.561
We can set
a private of marines to guard them.

09:24.640 --> 09:27.644
It's the captain's orders.
The doctor must get whatever she wants.

09:27.720 --> 09:31.247
But I suppose, as we're only
250 leagues from Jamaica now,

09:31.720 --> 09:32.721
it can be done.

09:34.640 --> 09:36.369
How many casks will you require?

09:37.760 --> 09:39.683
How many men would you like me to save?

09:41.960 --> 09:44.440
Now, about the food...

10:10.520 --> 10:12.010
You should be able to keep this down.

10:12.080 --> 10:14.811
It's a pap of scalded goat's milk
and pounded biscuit.

10:16.160 --> 10:17.525
Feel better, Mr Owens?

10:20.240 --> 10:22.766
You can touch the sick
if necessary, Mr Pound.

10:23.280 --> 10:24.884
But when you're down here,

10:24.960 --> 10:27.216
you must never touch your face
or your hair, or even your clothes,

10:27.240 --> 10:29.049
not until you've washed your hands again.

10:29.120 --> 10:30.121
Yes, Madam.

10:32.080 --> 10:34.242
How old are you, Mr Pound?

10:34.360 --> 10:35.361
Fourteen, Madam.

10:38.840 --> 10:40.569
What's your first name, if I may ask?

10:40.640 --> 10:41.641
Elias.

10:41.760 --> 10:42.921
May I call you that?

10:43.000 --> 10:46.402
The Captain mightn't like it.
'Tisn't said in the navy, you know?

10:47.800 --> 10:50.007
Well, I shall be very navy in public.

10:50.480 --> 10:52.005
But if we're going to work together,

10:52.080 --> 10:54.048
then ifs easier for me
to call you by your name.

10:56.160 --> 10:58.447
How long have you been at sea, Elias?

10:58.760 --> 11:00.364
Since I was seven, Madam.

11:00.440 --> 11:03.205
My uncle's a commander on Triton,
which allowed me a berth in her.

11:03.920 --> 11:05.840
I joined the Porpoise
just for this voyage alone.

11:10.080 --> 11:12.811
You are a very impressive young man.

11:32.440 --> 11:33.680
That's Jim Quigley, Madam.

11:34.960 --> 11:36.166
He's a friend.

11:37.320 --> 11:38.685
We're from the same town.

11:41.840 --> 11:43.922
Three more have come down with it, Madam.

11:45.240 --> 11:46.605
Can you put them over there?

11:50.120 --> 11:51.724
And if you can stay and help...

11:52.320 --> 11:53.526
Yes, Madam.

11:54.720 --> 11:56.165
Give these men some water.

12:24.000 --> 12:25.047
The surgeon's journal?

12:25.920 --> 12:29.481
Yes. Had it transferred
when he died. It's just here.

12:29.600 --> 12:32.251
I need to know the first
reported case of the disease.

12:32.320 --> 12:34.322
It would've been four weeks ago.

12:36.840 --> 12:38.046
Here, Ben Cole.

12:38.680 --> 12:39.681
Cole.

12:40.200 --> 12:43.886
"Reported sick this morning. Headache,
bellyache, dry cough, persistent fever."

12:44.360 --> 12:45.964
Steven Corey, same.

12:49.960 --> 12:51.086
Two the next day.

12:51.480 --> 12:55.201
MacMorrow, Enthwhistle,
same symptoms, same...

12:57.320 --> 13:00.130
This notation
beside the names, C-A-R-P, that's...

13:00.480 --> 13:01.527
Carpenter's crew.

13:02.680 --> 13:04.489
Did they mess in the same room?

13:06.160 --> 13:07.446
Captain, as I've explained,

13:07.520 --> 13:10.490
the disease is passed by hands and food.
Where did they mess?

13:10.600 --> 13:12.045
The carpenter's store on the orlop.

13:12.120 --> 13:14.521
Well, I need to speak
to the surviving men who messed there.

13:14.600 --> 13:18.286
Aye. Their names will be here.

13:23.600 --> 13:25.489
And what is this? DD?

13:27.800 --> 13:29.165
Discharged dead, Madam.

13:31.920 --> 13:32.921
All of them?

13:33.040 --> 13:34.041
Yes.

13:34.880 --> 13:36.530
All but one. Joe Howard.

13:37.120 --> 13:38.610
Well, he's sick now?

13:39.440 --> 13:40.771
No, he was never ill.

13:40.880 --> 13:42.644
He was reassigned,
on account of the deaths.

13:43.000 --> 13:45.731
He works in the galley now
with Mr Cosworth, our cook.

13:46.640 --> 13:47.687
I'm fine and dandy.

13:48.360 --> 13:51.409
As you can plainly see,
Howard has not been taken ill.

13:51.960 --> 13:53.610
How can he be the source of the disease?

13:53.680 --> 13:55.045
A man can still have the disease

13:55.120 --> 13:57.691
without showing any signs
and still pass it to other men.

13:57.760 --> 13:59.603
She's speaking gibberish.

13:59.680 --> 14:02.923
She already has me
dedicating all my pots to boiling water.

14:03.000 --> 14:06.129
We're on half rations of grog because we
have to wash our hands in alcohol.

14:06.240 --> 14:08.641
And for what? Men are still dying.

14:08.720 --> 14:12.122
Well, they're dying because the source
of the disease is serving the food.

14:13.880 --> 14:16.850
Captain, I'll not give up
my one remaining galley hand

14:16.960 --> 14:20.601
on account of
a cursed woman's foolish notion.

14:20.920 --> 14:22.763
It's not foolish.

14:23.160 --> 14:24.446
Captain, really?

14:25.080 --> 14:27.401
A man is either sick or well,
as anyone can see.

14:27.480 --> 14:29.881
Just because
it's beyond our comprehension, Cosworth,

14:29.960 --> 14:31.291
doesn't make it less veracious.

14:31.720 --> 14:32.721
We must believe her.

14:33.400 --> 14:34.401
Master-at-arms?

14:35.920 --> 14:37.206
Take this man into custody.

14:40.240 --> 14:41.241
What have I done?

14:41.760 --> 14:44.161
It's not to punish you, Howard,
only to keep the men safe.

14:48.640 --> 14:51.041
You'd better be right
about this, Mistress Fraser.

15:16.040 --> 15:17.041
Five minutes.

15:23.800 --> 15:25.131
How are you, Milord?

15:25.600 --> 15:27.409
It's very close in there, no?

15:33.960 --> 15:36.725
I'm well acquainted
with the inside of a cell, Fergus.

15:37.760 --> 15:38.761
Though,

15:39.920 --> 15:41.251
not a floating one.

15:42.080 --> 15:44.686
Milady will be safe, Milord.
I'm sure of it.

15:45.240 --> 15:47.891
You told me it's impossible
for her to get the disease, no?

15:48.920 --> 15:51.446
There's more than disease
aboard that ship, lad.

15:54.400 --> 15:56.004
There are 300 men.

16:07.560 --> 16:09.403
I lost her once, Fergus.

16:11.720 --> 16:12.960
I cannae lose her again.

16:15.240 --> 16:16.366
Get me the keys.

16:19.560 --> 16:20.561
The keys, Milord?

16:21.360 --> 16:23.328
Have you forgotten you're a pickpocket?

16:25.720 --> 16:27.688
Get the keys from Raines, set me free.

16:28.240 --> 16:29.241
We'll take the ship.

16:30.240 --> 16:31.241
Make all sail.

16:33.280 --> 16:34.281
Mutiny?

16:35.040 --> 16:36.280
It can't work, Milord.

16:36.800 --> 16:38.962
The crew, they're not yours.
They will not follow you.

16:39.040 --> 16:40.565
Some will.

16:41.600 --> 16:43.682
Dumez and Girard
have long been in Jared's service.

16:43.760 --> 16:46.684
We'll have Willoughby, Lesley, HaYes.

16:46.920 --> 16:48.843
Seven against 20? We'll lose.

16:48.920 --> 16:50.206
Convince more.

16:54.480 --> 16:56.448
Manzetti will come our way.

16:58.160 --> 16:59.366
Others, too.

17:00.200 --> 17:04.046
But the Porpoise is a day ahead of us.
We cannot catch them.

17:05.200 --> 17:07.362
Then we'll abandon Jared's wine.

17:08.440 --> 17:12.330
An empty ship runs faster.
We'll catch the Porpoise...

17:12.400 --> 17:13.401
And then what?

17:13.520 --> 17:15.249
I dinnae ken... Yet.

17:16.119 --> 17:18.248
I'll get to that matter
when we catch them.

17:21.079 --> 17:22.080
No.

17:22.760 --> 17:24.046
I love her, too, Milord, but...

17:25.040 --> 17:27.486
What good are you, you damn fool?

17:30.080 --> 17:32.481
I see I was right
to withhold my blessing from you.

17:34.640 --> 17:37.086
Proves ye dinnae ken what love is.

17:39.120 --> 17:40.645
You do not mean that, Milord.

17:41.640 --> 17:43.085
How could you say that?

17:43.400 --> 17:44.481
Because if ye did,

17:45.560 --> 17:47.562
ye would move heaven and Earth.

17:48.640 --> 17:50.529
Ye would risk arrest and death.

17:53.040 --> 17:54.201
Even hell.

18:02.960 --> 18:06.328
Ye would do it
as easily as the prick of a pin.

18:09.400 --> 18:11.050
Ye'd set me free from this cell,

18:12.320 --> 18:15.688
to help me rescue the woman I love
from her kidnappers.

18:16.440 --> 18:19.284
Until ye risk all,
ye cannae speak of love.

18:30.520 --> 18:31.726
Get me those keys.

18:33.520 --> 18:37.570
Help me break free, and I will give ye
my blessing to marry Marsali.

19:05.200 --> 19:08.761
The last stitch must go through his nose,
Madam, to be sure he's dead.

19:13.120 --> 19:14.884
'Tis always done by a friend.

19:43.280 --> 19:45.601
Ship's company, off hats.

19:57.560 --> 19:59.767
In the midst of life, we are in death.

20:01.120 --> 20:03.361
Of whom may we seek for succour,
but of thee, O Lord,

20:03.840 --> 20:05.968
whom for our sins art justly displeased?

20:07.560 --> 20:09.847
Thou knowest, Lord,
the secrets of our hearts.

20:10.800 --> 20:13.121
Shut not thy merciful ears to our prayer,

20:13.200 --> 20:17.364
but spare us, Lord, most holy,
O God most mighty.

20:18.440 --> 20:22.604
Suffer us not, at our last hour,
for any pains of death, to fall from thee.

20:23.640 --> 20:26.883
Therefore, in the sure and certain hope
of resurrection to eternal life,

20:27.480 --> 20:31.530
we commend to Almighty God our shipmates,
and we commit their bodies to the deep.

20:34.960 --> 20:36.530
Present arms!

20:37.400 --> 20:38.401
Ready.

20:38.960 --> 20:39.961
Fire!

20:47.400 --> 20:49.129
Our Father, which an in heaven,

20:49.760 --> 20:50.886
hallowed be thy name.

20:51.840 --> 20:56.971
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done,
on Earth as it is in heaven.

20:59.720 --> 21:01.802
Give us this day our daily bread.

21:02.680 --> 21:04.444
And forgive us our trespasses,

21:04.520 --> 21:07.046
as we forgive those
who trespass against us.

21:07.680 --> 21:11.287
And lead us not into temptation,
but deliver us from evil,

21:11.760 --> 21:17.085
for thine is the kingdom and the power
and the glory, forever and ever.

21:17.720 --> 21:18.721
Amen.

21:39.040 --> 21:40.246
Eleven dead.

21:41.480 --> 21:42.925
That's more than Yesterday.

21:43.560 --> 21:45.608
More than the day before that.

21:51.440 --> 21:53.169
What are you doing about it?

21:54.720 --> 21:59.089
Boiling water and washing hands.

22:01.240 --> 22:04.403
There'd better be fewer
in the days to come is what I say...

22:05.400 --> 22:06.401
Doctor.

22:06.760 --> 22:08.364
As you were, Mr Cosworth.

22:20.960 --> 22:23.167
The cook's always been a disagreeable man.

22:25.760 --> 22:27.171
Is there a secret to it?

22:28.520 --> 22:29.646
Secret?

22:30.920 --> 22:33.446
Remaining so calm
in the face of so much death.

22:35.360 --> 22:36.521
There is, actually.

22:37.640 --> 22:39.324
In fact, there's a word for it.

22:39.800 --> 22:41.325
"Compartmentalising."

22:42.200 --> 22:43.486
It means...

22:44.640 --> 22:48.008
Separating certain areas
of your life so...

22:49.880 --> 22:51.245
So you can do your work.

22:52.280 --> 22:55.489
If you let yourself
be affected by every death,

22:56.240 --> 22:57.605
you'd never save a life.

23:00.920 --> 23:01.967
Then again,

23:03.000 --> 23:05.082
Jim Quigley was not my friend.

23:07.080 --> 23:08.127
I think I see.

23:11.760 --> 23:15.321
This won't be the last burial
at sea for the Porpoise, Elias.

23:16.320 --> 23:19.244
But with any luck, we'll get through it.

23:20.200 --> 23:21.440
Begging your pardon, Madam,

23:21.920 --> 23:23.880
but after three days
of watching you at your work,

23:24.160 --> 23:26.083
I do not think
much of it will come down to luck.

23:27.440 --> 23:29.568
But if it is to be luck,
then you should have this.

23:32.760 --> 23:35.604
My own mother gave it to me
as a boy before I left on Triton.

23:36.280 --> 23:37.770
"Luck and health," she said.

23:38.600 --> 23:41.080
Well, that is what we need.

23:46.840 --> 23:48.285
Thank you, Elias.

23:51.280 --> 23:53.044
When was the last time
you saw your mother?

23:54.560 --> 23:58.167
She's dead, Madam.
May God rest her spirit.

24:00.440 --> 24:03.569
Begging your pardon, Madam.
Another man's been taken ill.

24:04.240 --> 24:06.083
It's Mistress Johansens husband.

24:06.160 --> 24:07.491
Mistress Johansen?

24:07.560 --> 24:10.166
The lady that tends to the goats
and provides milk for the men.

24:11.480 --> 24:12.481
Right.

24:13.000 --> 24:14.081
Take me to him.

24:26.720 --> 24:27.801
No breathing.

24:32.000 --> 24:34.731
He is. It's just very slow.

24:37.120 --> 24:38.531
He's as cold as ice.

24:39.160 --> 24:41.527
It's not fever. When did the symptom...

24:43.880 --> 24:46.281
of all the stupid, foolish...

24:46.360 --> 24:47.361
Madam?

24:49.040 --> 24:51.176
Half the men
on this fucking ship are dying of typhoid,

24:51.200 --> 24:53.487
and this bloody fool
has almost drank himself to death

24:53.560 --> 24:56.450
on the alcohol I need to stop
the goddamn fever from spreading.

25:02.840 --> 25:04.080
I'm sorry, Mr Pound.

25:04.800 --> 25:06.928
I didn't mean to offend your tender ears.

25:07.000 --> 25:10.686
I've heard many such things before, Madam,
but not from a gentlewoman.

25:11.280 --> 25:13.009
I'm not a gentlewoman, Mr Pound.

25:14.080 --> 25:15.889
Mistress Johansen, do you speak English?

25:16.600 --> 25:17.681
Little.

25:17.760 --> 25:20.445
Your husband has alcohol poisoning.

25:21.360 --> 25:23.840
He will be fine. He will wake up, Yes?

25:26.080 --> 25:28.924
Mr Pound, stay with Corporal Johansen.

25:30.280 --> 25:31.645
Keep him on his side.

25:32.120 --> 25:33.736
Make sure he doesn't choke
on his own vomit.

25:33.760 --> 25:34.921
Yes, Madam.

25:36.320 --> 25:37.481
Mistress Johansen...

25:37.560 --> 25:39.722
Annekje. My name.

25:40.160 --> 25:41.161
Annekje...

25:42.840 --> 25:46.003
Thank you for all the work
you're doing with the goats' milk.

25:46.320 --> 25:47.765
It's keeping the men alive.

25:48.640 --> 25:49.721
I keep do?

25:50.960 --> 25:53.486
Yes. Please. Keep do.

25:58.760 --> 26:00.489
Godsokers, Mistress Fraser.

26:01.240 --> 26:03.129
Seamen will drink almost anything.

26:03.200 --> 26:07.000
Spoiled plum brandy, peaches mashed
in an empty boot left to ferment.

26:07.080 --> 26:10.323
Well, I've even known a seamen
who slept with his head in an empty rum...

26:10.400 --> 26:13.165
The harbourmaster had record
of only one three-masted frigate

26:13.240 --> 26:15.925
sailing under
the Portuguese flag, the Bruja.

26:16.160 --> 26:17.286
Mr Jones?

26:18.160 --> 26:19.446
Is that a Portuguese flag?

26:19.840 --> 26:20.841
Aye.

26:21.840 --> 26:22.841
Where did that come from?

26:23.600 --> 26:24.886
Well, two weeks ago,

26:24.960 --> 26:27.201
we boarded a Portuguese frigate
in search of a surgeon.

26:27.280 --> 26:30.170
What was the name of the ship?
Was it the Bruja?

26:30.880 --> 26:34.566
I wouldn't know.
Captain would remember, though, I wager.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.247
Captain Leonard?

26:45.240 --> 26:46.241
Captain?

27:10.800 --> 27:12.086
Portuguese frigate...

27:17.720 --> 27:18.926
Casador.

27:19.800 --> 27:20.801
Damn it.

27:30.240 --> 27:31.241
Jamie.

27:34.000 --> 27:35.729
"Harry Tompkins, able seaman,

27:35.840 --> 27:38.320
"tells me Alexander Malcolm,
wanted seditioner,

27:38.400 --> 27:39.811
"was seen on board the Artemis.

27:40.480 --> 27:43.051
"I've deduced that he means the man I met,

27:43.120 --> 27:46.602
"Jamie Fraser,
obviously going by an alias."

27:49.200 --> 27:50.247
Captain Leonard...

27:54.680 --> 27:56.887
Mr Coswonh,
I was looking for the captain.

27:58.880 --> 28:01.326
And not finding him,
entered notwithstanding.

28:02.400 --> 28:04.323
Yes. Pardon me.

28:06.240 --> 28:08.049
You trespass, Madam.

28:09.200 --> 28:11.089
By all appearances, so do you.

28:11.520 --> 28:12.521
No.

28:12.720 --> 28:14.609
I've come
to fetch Captain Leonard's pipe,

28:15.280 --> 28:16.770
at his request.

28:16.880 --> 28:18.564
Well, then he'll be expecting you.

28:21.920 --> 28:24.366
I don't like you, Madam.

28:25.840 --> 28:27.410
I don't trust you either.

28:30.160 --> 28:32.481
I have the captain's best interests.

28:33.360 --> 28:35.283
And I'll know why you're here.

28:35.760 --> 28:38.331
Well, you may have his interest,
but I have his trust.

28:38.400 --> 28:39.731
And what do you think will happen

28:39.800 --> 28:43.088
if I tell him you tried
to violate me on his dining table?

28:43.200 --> 28:44.486
I did no such thing.

28:44.560 --> 28:46.369
And who do you think he'll believe?

28:46.440 --> 28:49.250
He'll have you arrested so quick,
your head'll spin.

28:51.040 --> 28:52.804
Now get out of my way...

28:54.280 --> 28:56.009
Or I will scream.

29:19.280 --> 29:22.489
The cook and his suspicions
were the least of my worries.

29:23.360 --> 29:26.250
Someone on this ship had recognised Jamie.

29:27.360 --> 29:29.806
I had to find this Harry Tompkins.

29:41.200 --> 29:42.440
He'll allow us to marry?

29:43.320 --> 29:47.041
If I break him loose
and help him take the ship, then, Yes.

29:49.160 --> 29:50.207
And if ye fail?

29:53.280 --> 29:54.805
Then I will join Milord in chains.

29:58.520 --> 30:00.124
It's a risk, mon coeur.

30:00.200 --> 30:01.964
But one I'm willing
to take to be with you.

30:08.640 --> 30:10.404
Ye risk not being with me at all.

30:11.440 --> 30:14.330
I'll be left alone on this vessel,
with no one to protect me.

30:51.560 --> 30:53.881
No, no. No, I'm sorry. We can't.

30:54.120 --> 30:55.610
Daddy's locked up below decks,

30:55.680 --> 30:58.001
and that woman of his
is on some other ship.

30:58.080 --> 31:01.084
No one is keeping an eye on us,
if ye hadn't noticed.

31:01.160 --> 31:02.161
And with you,

31:02.760 --> 31:03.921
about to risk yer life,

31:04.880 --> 31:09.044
now may be our only chance.

31:10.400 --> 31:12.289
We must wait until we're married.

31:13.800 --> 31:15.040
I've promised Milord.

31:18.040 --> 31:19.724
There's true hope for us now.

31:22.120 --> 31:23.360
Ye're just like him, you know?

31:24.280 --> 31:25.520
Stubborn.

31:26.560 --> 31:28.483
Once ye give yer word,
ye'll never break it.

31:58.040 --> 32:00.042
Mistress Johansen's husband is improving.

32:01.040 --> 32:03.008
Good. Have you slept yet?

32:06.440 --> 32:08.568
You know,
you can sit down. It is all right.

32:16.040 --> 32:17.087
Elias...

32:18.400 --> 32:21.370
Do you know a sailor
on board named Harry Tompkins?

32:21.880 --> 32:22.881
No.

32:23.000 --> 32:26.447
But then I wouldn't know every name.
We were 400 strong when we began.

32:28.440 --> 32:30.568
I see. Thank you.

32:31.440 --> 32:32.885
Four new cases today.

32:33.360 --> 32:35.560
I should've thought
finding a carrier would've ended it.

32:35.960 --> 32:38.361
Well, there is
the incubation period to consider...

32:40.680 --> 32:41.681
Madam?

32:43.520 --> 32:47.002
The reason I asked about Tompkins...

32:48.160 --> 32:49.685
He may be a second carrier.

32:49.760 --> 32:51.364
- Should I inform the captain?
- No.

32:51.600 --> 32:55.002
I don't want to stir up trouble
like we had with Howard in the galley.

32:55.600 --> 32:57.648
But if you could get word out to the crew

32:57.720 --> 32:59.688
that I need to see
this Tompkins right away.

33:00.240 --> 33:03.050
Just don't tell them what for just yet.

33:03.240 --> 33:04.241
Of course.

33:05.960 --> 33:06.961
Thank you.

33:09.640 --> 33:10.971
And then get some sleep.

33:24.360 --> 33:26.840
I don't trust him, even locked up.

33:26.920 --> 33:29.969
Don't forget, his men were the cause
of all that bad luck we had.

33:30.160 --> 33:31.241
That's the truth.

33:32.280 --> 33:33.281
Where is he now?

33:34.160 --> 33:35.491
In the galley store.

33:36.040 --> 33:37.041
Will you set him free?

33:37.280 --> 33:38.327
I will not.

33:38.400 --> 33:40.402
The supercargo is cargo himself now.

33:40.960 --> 33:43.042
He's lucky we didn't toss him overboard.

33:43.720 --> 33:45.370
The Frenchie still wanders free.

33:45.840 --> 33:47.808
Who? The cripple? He's no trouble.

33:48.200 --> 33:49.326
No trouble, no.

33:49.400 --> 33:51.164
I wouldn't mind a taste of his wee lassie.

33:51.240 --> 33:53.129
And I bet she's no virgin.

33:53.200 --> 33:54.770
Not by the time I'm done with her.

33:54.840 --> 33:57.161
Lassies is bad luck on ships.

33:57.240 --> 33:59.720
That's enough of that. Back to work.

34:05.680 --> 34:07.921
Please, McGregor,
I've told you. I've told you!

34:08.000 --> 34:09.001
Get him in!

34:16.560 --> 34:18.244
Your Harry Tompkins, Madam.

34:18.480 --> 34:21.529
I ordered them not to beat him,
Mistress Fraser, but he tried to hide.

34:21.600 --> 34:24.206
As I've naught to do
with this bloody fever.

34:31.880 --> 34:33.199
Thank you, gentlemen. You can go.

34:33.639 --> 34:34.641
Madam.

34:34.960 --> 34:37.201
You too, Pound.
You're asleep on your feet.

34:37.280 --> 34:38.281
Go get some rest.

34:46.840 --> 34:48.967
Right, Mr Tompkins.

34:52.239 --> 34:54.322
I know who you are, Mistress.

34:55.040 --> 34:58.203
I saw Mr Malcolm from the boat
when I rowed the captain over.

34:59.640 --> 35:00.641
You're his wife.

35:02.640 --> 35:03.641
Yes.

35:04.440 --> 35:05.441
I am.

35:18.640 --> 35:22.804
Now, you're going to tell me
exactly what you know about my husband.

35:24.200 --> 35:25.201
Or what?

35:26.160 --> 35:27.366
You'll cutoff me arm?

35:28.000 --> 35:29.001
Go on, then.

35:30.280 --> 35:32.886
In fact, kill me.

35:33.760 --> 35:35.125
I'll thank you for it.

35:35.200 --> 35:36.326
After the month I've had,

35:36.400 --> 35:38.926
I'll be more than glad
to see the inside of a casket.

35:41.000 --> 35:43.685
Three months ago, I had both feet on land,

35:43.760 --> 35:48.482
working for His Majesty's Excise
for Sir Percival Turner.

35:49.480 --> 35:52.802
I followed a lad
to Mr Malcolm's print shop,

35:52.920 --> 35:55.730
and I uncover a treasonous plot, don't I?

35:56.560 --> 35:59.006
Only the little shite
throws hot lead in me face,

35:59.080 --> 36:00.889
and I'm nearly burned alive.

36:02.520 --> 36:03.931
I make it out of there,

36:05.120 --> 36:07.646
scarred for life.

36:08.240 --> 36:10.766
And I inform Sir Percival of the matter.

36:11.480 --> 36:13.403
I reckon I'm fit to be promoted.

36:14.600 --> 36:18.321
Instead, I'm pressed into service
on a ship full of disease.

36:19.040 --> 36:20.371
So go ahead, yeah?

36:20.800 --> 36:21.801
Here's me neck.

36:22.720 --> 36:25.246
Put me out of me misery!

36:26.960 --> 36:28.166
Maybe I will.

36:29.200 --> 36:32.170
My husband can't get arrested
on the captain's words alone.

36:32.840 --> 36:34.251
Nor Sir Percival's.

36:38.080 --> 36:40.890
They have your husband now, Madam,

36:41.480 --> 36:44.768
and warrants for his arrest
for murder and high treason.

36:46.360 --> 36:47.361
Murder?

36:47.880 --> 36:51.521
Guess what we found
the day before the press gang got me?

36:52.000 --> 36:54.526
In a cask of créme de menthe it were.

37:09.360 --> 37:13.001
My husband did not kill that man.

37:13.320 --> 37:14.970
The warrants say otherwise.

37:15.400 --> 37:16.526
I've told the captain.

37:16.600 --> 37:19.251
He'll write a report
as soon as we land in Jamaica.

37:20.240 --> 37:21.446
Well, I'll talk him out of it.

37:21.960 --> 37:24.201
Captain Leonard's an ambitious man.

37:25.560 --> 37:29.804
He wants the admiral to give him
command of his own ship, you see.

37:30.120 --> 37:32.930
Little chance, of course.

37:34.040 --> 37:37.408
But if he brings in a wanted seditioner,

37:37.800 --> 37:39.768
it just might.

37:40.160 --> 37:42.891
I'll wager
he'll not be talked out of that.

37:45.080 --> 37:47.765
The authorities
will be waitin' for your husband

37:47.840 --> 37:50.127
when he comes to fetch you in Kingston.

37:50.800 --> 37:52.370
And then he'll be hanged.

38:01.200 --> 38:03.043
He's the second source of the fever.

38:21.240 --> 38:23.846
You know, I wouldn't
get too close to Howard if I were you,

38:24.360 --> 38:26.249
not unless you want to catch the disease.

38:27.480 --> 38:28.641
He actually is the source.

38:48.160 --> 38:50.811
I hear your husband is doing much better.

38:51.440 --> 38:53.283
Ja. Thank you.

39:02.000 --> 39:03.968
Cheese. Goat.

39:05.000 --> 39:06.001
Thank you.

39:14.600 --> 39:15.931
Smells delicious.

39:23.880 --> 39:25.962
What sad you?

39:27.080 --> 39:30.084
No, I'm all right. It's just...

39:33.800 --> 39:34.881
It's my husband.

39:36.880 --> 39:39.565
I'm afraid he's going to be in trouble
when he arrives in Jamaica,

39:39.640 --> 39:40.641
and I've

39:41.520 --> 39:42.681
no way to warn him.

39:44.000 --> 39:46.321
In fact, I think
they're going to try and use me as bait.

39:48.040 --> 39:49.326
I don't know what to do.

39:51.800 --> 39:52.801
I help.

39:56.320 --> 39:57.446
That's very kind,

39:58.760 --> 40:00.205
but I'm not sure how you could.

40:02.320 --> 40:04.243
My goats needs grass.

40:07.440 --> 40:09.329
I'm not sure I know what you mean.

40:10.080 --> 40:12.367
My goats needs grass, so...

40:18.160 --> 40:19.400
Well, thank you.

40:38.800 --> 40:39.801
Fergus.

40:41.960 --> 40:43.166
Did you bring the keys?

40:45.080 --> 40:46.286
I do not have them.

40:56.720 --> 40:57.801
You could not get them.

40:59.120 --> 41:00.167
I didn't try.

41:03.960 --> 41:05.644
What in the name of Holy God do you mean?

41:06.720 --> 41:08.131
You haven't been on deck, Milord.

41:08.520 --> 41:11.000
You haven't seen the looks
or heard the talk of the men.

41:11.800 --> 41:13.882
If I free you and we don't succeed...

41:14.840 --> 41:16.285
They'll throw us both into the sea.

41:16.360 --> 41:18.010
We will succeed.

41:19.280 --> 41:20.361
We will not.

41:21.160 --> 41:23.686
They will kill us,
and Marsali will be alone.

41:24.400 --> 41:25.765
I will not leave her alone.

41:27.400 --> 41:28.925
And I won't send you to your death.

41:31.080 --> 41:33.651
I know you won't give us
your blessing now, but...

41:36.920 --> 41:39.651
You asked me if I would move
heaven and Earth for the woman I love,

41:39.720 --> 41:40.881
and I will...

41:42.040 --> 41:43.883
Even if it means I cannot marry her.

41:46.800 --> 41:49.280
I do this for you as well, Milord.

41:51.600 --> 41:53.602
Fergus. Fergus.

41:55.320 --> 41:56.446
Perhaps I love too much.

41:59.240 --> 42:00.241
Fergus!

42:03.160 --> 42:04.161
Fergus!

42:08.760 --> 42:10.444
Pleasant sound, isn't it?

42:12.600 --> 42:13.601
It's silent.

42:14.000 --> 42:15.001
Aye.

42:15.080 --> 42:17.765
No moans nor groans for three days now.

42:18.640 --> 42:21.371
No one begging Christ's mercy
for a quick death,

42:21.720 --> 42:22.960
just sleeping men.

42:24.560 --> 42:26.005
We're over the worst of it now.

43:38.440 --> 43:39.441
Elias?

43:48.920 --> 43:49.921
Mother?

43:55.640 --> 43:56.926
Yes, Elias.

43:58.480 --> 43:59.561
It's Mother.

44:03.040 --> 44:04.724
It's time for you to come home now.

44:52.440 --> 44:54.408
Your mother would be so proud.

45:12.880 --> 45:14.723
It should be done by a friend.

46:23.560 --> 46:24.846
I missed the signs.

46:25.280 --> 46:28.443
I thought he was simply tired.

46:29.560 --> 46:31.050
Your efforts have been heroic.

46:32.200 --> 46:35.727
There has been only one death today,
sad as it may be.

46:37.080 --> 46:38.286
And not one new case.

46:39.280 --> 46:41.442
We had three of each Yesterday.
More the day before.

46:41.520 --> 46:42.851
It doesn't matter.

46:44.200 --> 46:47.249
The purser tells me
we're almost out of drinking water.

46:47.880 --> 46:51.487
The sick simply
can't survive without constant liquids,

46:51.760 --> 46:53.330
saying nothing of the healthy.

46:54.440 --> 46:55.566
You will do your best.

46:56.400 --> 46:57.401
And so shall I.

46:58.240 --> 46:59.969
And together, we'll reach Jamaica safely.

47:02.600 --> 47:04.602
I'm sorry for your loss, Mistress Fraser.

47:05.520 --> 47:06.567
And I am grateful.

47:16.200 --> 47:17.281
Mistress Fraser?

47:18.520 --> 47:19.521
Mistress Fraser.

47:19.720 --> 47:20.767
What is it?

47:20.840 --> 47:21.921
They've caught a whiff.

47:24.720 --> 47:25.767
Land.

47:25.840 --> 47:27.968
You can always smell it before you see it.

47:28.040 --> 47:29.041
Jamaica?

47:29.120 --> 47:30.201
No, Madam.

47:30.280 --> 47:33.124
But we'll reach the Grand Turk
in the forenoon tomorrow.

47:33.200 --> 47:34.804
We'll have water for the men.

47:34.880 --> 47:37.326
And grass for mine goats.

47:38.200 --> 47:40.726
I realised in that moment
what Annekje had meant.

47:41.240 --> 47:42.241
Come on.

47:44.400 --> 47:47.085
She could indeed
help me escape and find Jamie.

47:48.640 --> 47:50.210
And now I understood how.

47:52.160 --> 47:53.650
We were under quarantine

47:53.720 --> 47:54.760
and would therefore anchor

47:54.800 --> 47:57.690
on the unpopulated side
of Grand Turk Island.

48:00.160 --> 48:01.571
Annekje had a plan.

48:02.880 --> 48:04.370
Her goats needed grass.

48:07.200 --> 48:10.363
As their milk
was the only food keeping the men alive,

48:10.920 --> 48:14.208
she would be let off to feed them,
along with the watering party.

48:14.480 --> 48:15.481
Come on.

48:15.560 --> 48:16.925
And I would go with her.

48:19.040 --> 48:20.644
Stay close. Captain's orders.

48:22.920 --> 48:25.161
Captains orders to stay by the beach!

48:29.560 --> 48:30.846
Go, now.

48:31.880 --> 48:32.927
Warn husband.

48:33.480 --> 48:36.245
I take care of men. I feed sick.

48:38.400 --> 48:39.401
Okay.

48:40.440 --> 48:41.726
Thank you, my friend.

49:13.800 --> 49:14.801
Captain Leonard.

49:15.400 --> 49:16.401
Mistress Fraser.

49:16.880 --> 49:18.405
The goats are supping well, I trust.

49:19.160 --> 49:20.161
Yes, of course.

49:21.000 --> 49:22.411
- What are you...
- Making rounds.

49:22.800 --> 49:23.936
I had thought that some of the men

49:23.960 --> 49:26.850
might find their proximity to a brothel
too appealing to resist.

49:27.800 --> 49:31.600
I had not thought that you, our doctor,
would disobey my orders to not wander.

49:32.600 --> 49:35.444
No, I was looking for herbs.

49:36.000 --> 49:37.240
In the direction of the port?

49:39.240 --> 49:40.366
Am I?

49:42.520 --> 49:45.285
This landfall is
as much your victory as mine, Madam.

49:45.600 --> 49:47.489
And I do not lie
when I insist I'm in your debt.

49:49.120 --> 49:50.849
But I cannot let you warn your husband.

49:54.000 --> 49:55.490
I know what you saw in my logbook.

49:58.200 --> 49:59.611
I do not relish the task,

50:00.400 --> 50:01.401
but I am duty bound

50:01.480 --> 50:04.131
to repofl your husband's
crimes to the authorities in Jamaica.

50:05.280 --> 50:06.611
And to use me as bait.

50:07.760 --> 50:10.001
It would be breaking the law
if I did not do it.

50:10.840 --> 50:13.411
Perhaps, more importantly,
I would break a solemn oath.

50:14.400 --> 50:15.401
Just, please,

50:16.680 --> 50:18.170
can't you look the other way?

50:22.520 --> 50:23.521
Marines,

50:24.640 --> 50:26.120
kindly escort the doctor to the ship.

50:26.640 --> 50:27.926
She seems to have lost her way.

51:07.160 --> 51:09.367
I expect to be in sight of land by dawn.

51:12.720 --> 51:14.165
What's that to do with me?

51:16.760 --> 51:19.889
Passage between the islands
is hazardous all year through,

51:19.960 --> 51:21.246
but much more so in winter.

51:22.720 --> 51:26.361
I need all good and able men
if I'm to navigate the shoals.

51:28.040 --> 51:30.930
So I'm good and able now, am I?

51:40.600 --> 51:41.601
What's she doing here?

51:42.320 --> 51:44.322
She's persuaded me you'll not rebel.

51:44.600 --> 51:45.601
Aye.

51:46.400 --> 51:47.765
Ask him to give you his word.

51:49.040 --> 51:50.804
Once he gives it, he'll never break it.

51:51.800 --> 51:52.926
What are you doing, lass?

51:53.880 --> 51:54.881
Just...

51:55.800 --> 51:58.644
Give him your word,
and he'll set you free.

52:01.240 --> 52:03.322
You cannae see
what he's done for you, can ye?

52:04.080 --> 52:05.081
Raines?

52:05.320 --> 52:06.321
No...

52:06.640 --> 52:07.641
Fergus.

52:09.200 --> 52:11.202
What Fergus did, he did for you.

52:11.720 --> 52:12.846
If you believe that,

52:13.520 --> 52:15.488
you dinnae deserve to be let out of here.

52:33.120 --> 52:34.246
You may have a moment.

52:34.320 --> 52:35.970
But as I said,

52:37.160 --> 52:38.286
I need all hands.

52:40.840 --> 52:41.841
By the mark.

52:41.920 --> 52:44.048
Seven fathoms.

52:45.760 --> 52:46.761
Steady now.

52:48.800 --> 52:50.165
You have my blessing.

52:50.640 --> 52:52.005
You can be married in Jamaica.

52:53.200 --> 52:54.247
By a priest.

52:55.400 --> 52:57.050
You'll need to prove yourself to her,

52:57.600 --> 53:00.206
as much as to me. And then...

53:00.320 --> 53:02.448
First, let us get to Jamaica.

53:06.480 --> 53:07.481
Thank you,

53:08.560 --> 53:09.607
<i>mon fils.</i>

53:10.440 --> 53:11.441
Fraser!

53:12.880 --> 53:15.486
By the deep. Six and a half fathoms.

53:26.720 --> 53:27.721
Go!

53:28.160 --> 53:29.161
Now!

53:29.760 --> 53:30.761
What?

53:34.160 --> 53:35.161
Cockburn.

53:36.600 --> 53:37.601
You jump.

53:39.560 --> 53:40.561
Jump?

53:47.040 --> 53:49.441
I can't jump in the ocean
in the middle of the night.

53:49.960 --> 53:50.961
I'll drown.

53:52.320 --> 53:55.005
No, no, no. Not drown. Not drown.

53:59.560 --> 54:00.686
I know water.

54:01.080 --> 54:02.684
Water, it'll move you.

54:03.920 --> 54:06.048
Take you Cockburn. Take you Cockburn.

54:06.120 --> 54:09.488
The ships not far, come. Go now. Go.

54:13.080 --> 54:14.081
A raft?

54:15.640 --> 54:16.641
I'm sorry.

54:17.120 --> 54:18.963
That's crazy. I can't.

54:19.720 --> 54:21.882
Eight bells, and all's well.

54:27.920 --> 54:28.967
I heard things.

54:29.040 --> 54:30.451
Your husband will hang.

54:30.920 --> 54:32.922
News only chance. Please!

54:34.920 --> 54:37.446
Get yourself organised, Jack.
You can get a hot meal inside.

54:41.640 --> 54:42.641
Money.

54:43.040 --> 54:45.088
You pay Ship.

54:50.320 --> 54:51.810
Okay, okay.

54:51.880 --> 54:52.881
Off.

55:43.080 --> 55:44.525
Jesus H. Roosevelt Christ.
