36:25.780 --> 36:27.577
MIGHT WANT

36:27.580 --> 36:29.639
YOU MIGHT WANT

MARY MCDONALD,

37:21.370 --> 37:23.804
IS LIAM FITZPATRICKS
MATERNAL GRANDMOTHER.

37:23.810 --> 37:25.368
THAT IT?

37:28.640 --> 37:30.904
WEEVIL SAID
THIS KID ON THE BUS, CERVANDO,

37:30.910 --> 37:32.878
THOUGHT THE FITZPATRICKS
WERE AFTER HIM.

37:32.880 --> 37:35.440
HE RIPPED THEM OFF,
THEN WENT BRAGGING.

37:35.450 --> 37:38.942
LIAM WANTED TO SHUT
CERVANDO UP PRETTY BAD.

37:38.950 --> 37:42.420
AND SINCE LIAM
HAD ACCESS TO EXPLOSIVES

37:42.430 --> 37:45.581
THROUGH HIS COUSIN DANNY...

37:45.590 --> 37:47.387
THATS THE BEST
I CAN COME UP WITH.

37:47.390 --> 37:48.926
IVE LOOKED
THROUGH ALL THIS STUFF,

37:48.930 --> 37:51.535
AND I STILL CANT FIND ANYTHING
TO CONNECT LIAM AND KENDALL.

38:04.280 --> 38:05.304
WHATS HE IN FOR?

38:05.310 --> 38:06.504
FRAUD.

38:06.510 --> 38:08.307
CORMAC AND KENDALL
WERE PARTNERS,

38:08.310 --> 38:09.868
GRIFTERS WORKING
THE LONG CON.

38:09.880 --> 38:11.552
SHE WAS HIS ROPER.

38:11.560 --> 38:12.857
THAT STINT SHE DID --

38:12.860 --> 38:14.657
I THINK SHE TOOK THE RAP
FOR CORMAC,

38:14.660 --> 38:16.685
SAVE HIM A THIRD STRIKE.

OWE KENDALL A BIG ONE.

38:19.420 --> 38:21.320
MAYBE LIAM
WAS FOLLOWING THE BUS.

38:21.330 --> 38:23.662
COULD HAVE JUST BEEN
OUT THERE AS KENDALLS EYES.

38:23.670 --> 38:25.820
CALLED HER
JUST AT THE RIGHT MOMENT.

38:25.830 --> 38:28.993
KENDALL COULD HAVE MADE
THE CALL THAT BLEW UP THE BUS

38:29.000 --> 38:32.299
WHILE SIPPING MARGARITAS
BY THE CASABLANCAS POOL.

38:32.310 --> 38:33.572
TALK TO LOGAN?

38:33.580 --> 38:35.070
HE WAS WITH HER THAT DAY,

38:35.080 --> 38:38.834

OUT HOURS BEFORE THE CRASH.

38:46.690 --> 38:48.578

39:49.580 --> 39:50.649
WE FIGURED
THATS WHAT HE USED.

39:50.650 --> 39:52.459
WHY ELSE WOULD IT BE
IN THE POOL?

39:52.460 --> 39:55.782
OKAY, BUT THAT DOESNT REALLY
CHANGE ANYTHING, DOES IT?

39:55.790 --> 39:58.111
THEY FOUND IT BURIED
IN THE KANES BACKYARD.

39:58.120 --> 40:00.452
THE NEW OWNERS
