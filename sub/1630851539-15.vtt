WEBVTT

00:04.172 --> 00:07.408
Get up, dude.
Mason, get up.

00:07.441 --> 00:10.344
Have there been any issues
with Mason lately?

00:10.378 --> 00:11.745
Drinking? Drugs?

00:12.846 --> 00:14.482
You come into my home

00:14.515 --> 00:16.150
and you accuse my son
of being a drug addict.

00:16.184 --> 00:18.086
They're just trying
to help us.

00:18.119 --> 00:20.421
Mason died
of a drug overdose.

00:20.454 --> 00:21.989
Hayden:
I found these on him.

00:22.022 --> 00:23.224
I know I shouldn't have
taken them.

00:23.257 --> 00:24.858
I didn't want
my parents knowing.

00:24.892 --> 00:26.394
Jenny: I had to
notify the family today.

00:26.427 --> 00:27.728
How'd that go?

00:27.761 --> 00:29.363
Richard,
you know how he gets.

00:29.397 --> 00:30.831
You know, I went through
recovery with him.

00:30.864 --> 00:31.999
I gotta reach out to him
and make sure he does not slip.

00:32.032 --> 00:33.834
Have you spoken
to Cassie?

00:33.867 --> 00:36.237
I think she's content
to stay off the grid for now.

00:36.270 --> 00:37.905
Something happened
while I was gone?

00:37.938 --> 00:39.540
Lila:
She was Veer's mistress.

00:39.573 --> 00:40.774
Travis fell in love
with her.

00:40.808 --> 00:42.210
Veer had her killed.

00:42.243 --> 00:44.112
And Travis is trying
to find out.

00:44.145 --> 00:46.347
He wants more than that.

00:46.380 --> 00:48.416
We ran into some trouble
in Toronto.

00:48.449 --> 00:49.750
Ren:
Is it the Kapoors?

00:49.783 --> 00:51.285
Are they gonna
come after us?

00:51.319 --> 00:54.021
If they do,
God help them all.

00:54.054 --> 00:56.290
Jenny: A kid died
with your drugs on him.

00:56.324 --> 00:58.559
Synthetic fentanyl,
laced with whatever filth

00:58.592 --> 01:00.094
that you're
cutting your batch with.

01:00.128 --> 01:01.462
You better find out
what she's talking about.

01:08.736 --> 01:10.738
Bad move.

01:13.407 --> 01:15.643
People know I'm here.

01:15.676 --> 01:17.010
No, they don't.

01:39.300 --> 01:42.903
Ahh!

01:44.538 --> 01:45.639
Ahh!

02:04.158 --> 02:07.761
What part of "get here now"
do you not understand?

02:07.795 --> 02:10.198
Just so you know,
I'm missing Arjan's UFC fight,

02:10.231 --> 02:11.632
and I have money
on that dude.

02:11.665 --> 02:13.501
Oh, a fistfight.
That's ironic.

02:13.534 --> 02:15.636
Funny.

02:15.669 --> 02:16.970
What couldn't you
tell me on the phone?

02:17.004 --> 02:19.440
Somebody's messing with
our product.

02:19.473 --> 02:21.209
Don't tell me,
another hijacking?

02:21.242 --> 02:24.212
No, that blonde cop showed up,
told me a kid OD'd.

02:24.245 --> 02:26.180
It's fentanyl. Hello.

02:26.214 --> 02:28.449
No, she said
it was laced.
How?

02:28.482 --> 02:30.017
I have Donno on it.

02:30.050 --> 02:32.286
Who else knows?
Just us.

02:32.320 --> 02:34.322
We don't tell Dad
until we have to.

02:34.355 --> 02:36.023
He already thinks we're not
ready to run things here.

02:36.056 --> 02:38.526
I don't want to
prove him right.

02:38.559 --> 02:41.462
You talk to Dhruv?
No.

02:41.495 --> 02:44.432
Called and texted on my way
over here -- no response.

02:45.399 --> 02:47.000
You seen Dhruv?

02:47.034 --> 02:48.135
He was just
making his rounds.

02:48.168 --> 02:49.703
Think he headed
down to the lab.

02:49.737 --> 02:51.071
Alright. Let's go.

03:11.124 --> 03:12.893
Ren: Oh, my God.
Jag: What is it?

03:12.926 --> 03:14.428
Nobody touch nothing, okay?

03:14.462 --> 03:16.530
There's fentanyl everywhere.

03:16.564 --> 03:18.666
This just happened. Whoever did
this is still on the property.

03:27.608 --> 03:29.277
Is he, um...?

03:47.995 --> 03:49.697
Jag.

04:24.164 --> 04:25.966
Travis.

04:25.999 --> 04:27.100
Jenny --
Jenny, you gotta go, now.

04:27.134 --> 04:28.602
Come with me.
No. No.

04:28.636 --> 04:30.003
No, Jenny --
Jenny, listen to me.

04:30.037 --> 04:31.405
You take this path
to the south gate.

04:31.439 --> 04:32.806
It's gonna lead you
to the road, okay?

04:32.840 --> 04:34.475
You gotta be quiet.
Travis, please.

04:34.508 --> 04:36.176
You can still get away.

04:36.209 --> 04:37.845
This could be your only chance
to get out.

04:37.878 --> 04:39.313
Come on.

04:40.781 --> 04:42.316
Please.

04:46.354 --> 04:48.021
I'm sorry, Jenny.

04:52.059 --> 04:53.861
You gotta go.

05:01.168 --> 05:02.436
Ren: Stone!

05:05.205 --> 05:07.107
See anything?

05:07.140 --> 05:08.509
No, I got nothing.
You?

05:08.542 --> 05:10.210
No.

05:22.923 --> 05:24.558
Doesn't it look good?

05:24.592 --> 05:25.693
I made it myself.

05:27.495 --> 05:29.563
Okay, not totally true.

05:29.597 --> 05:31.331
Donno here helped me.

05:31.365 --> 05:32.666
You wanna guess
what his

05:32.700 --> 05:34.868
super-duper
secret ingredient is?

05:36.236 --> 05:38.005
Stumped, huh?

05:38.038 --> 05:39.507
Go ahead, Donno.
Tell him.

05:42.843 --> 05:44.211
Is it cinnamon?

05:44.244 --> 05:45.646
No.

05:45.679 --> 05:47.014
Caramel?
Nope.

05:47.047 --> 05:48.582
Pumpkin?
Strike three.

05:48.616 --> 05:51.251
Well, wait, wait, wait.

05:51.284 --> 05:53.020
Is it amatoxin?

05:54.788 --> 05:57.558
A type of poison that destroys
your liver and organs

05:57.591 --> 05:59.560
while you're still conscious
and in excruciating pain?

05:59.593 --> 06:00.594
Bingo.

06:02.129 --> 06:04.231
Oh, don't be scared.

06:04.264 --> 06:07.367
All you have to do is answer
one simple question.

06:07.401 --> 06:09.236
The same question we're asking
all the dealers

06:09.269 --> 06:11.238
who distribute
Bhullar product.

06:11.271 --> 06:16.109
Are you
cutting our drugs?

06:20.280 --> 06:21.682
I don't know.
What do you think, Donno?

06:21.715 --> 06:23.283
Is he lying?
Mm.

06:23.316 --> 06:25.352
It's okay if you are.

06:25.385 --> 06:27.521
I mean, we'll still
give you a choice.

06:27.555 --> 06:29.923
The muffin...

06:29.957 --> 06:31.258
Or the hammer.

06:40.568 --> 06:41.602
It's Ren.

06:43.471 --> 06:45.873
Yeah?

06:45.906 --> 06:47.074
That's unfortunate.

06:48.308 --> 06:49.477
We're on our way.

06:50.944 --> 06:52.480
We have to go, now.

07:52.540 --> 07:53.974
Hi.

07:57.477 --> 07:59.146
I'll be right there.

08:13.527 --> 08:15.863
Thanks for coming.

08:15.896 --> 08:16.730
Yeah. Are you okay?

08:16.764 --> 08:18.699
Where's Kai?

08:18.732 --> 08:20.534
Um...he's still
at my Aunt Cathy's.

08:24.237 --> 08:27.007
Jenny,
what happened to you?

08:27.040 --> 08:29.743
I screwed up, Cassie...

08:29.777 --> 08:30.811
really badly.

08:30.844 --> 08:32.145
What?

08:32.179 --> 08:33.881
I-I can't be
alone right now.

08:33.914 --> 08:34.715
I-I don't know what to do.

08:37.450 --> 08:39.720
We'll figure it out.

08:39.753 --> 08:41.555
Just tell me
what happened.

08:54.234 --> 08:57.170
Here you go.
Gimme the old one.

08:57.204 --> 08:58.772
Thanks for
staying the night.

08:58.806 --> 09:01.709
Yeah.

09:01.742 --> 09:03.577
I got your back.
Always will.

09:06.213 --> 09:08.048
Mm. But you need to
tell Tubb everything.

09:08.081 --> 09:10.517
Ahh,
I don't know if I can.

09:10.550 --> 09:11.384
Why?

09:12.786 --> 09:13.921
Travis.

09:15.388 --> 09:17.290
Cassie,
he's working for them.

09:17.324 --> 09:20.093
But you don't know that
for sure.

09:20.127 --> 09:22.129
He helped you
get away.

09:22.162 --> 09:23.764
I don't know.

09:23.797 --> 09:27.200
I --
Can -- Can we just...

09:27.234 --> 09:28.435
Let's just talk about
something else.

09:30.137 --> 09:31.739
Yeah. Sure.

09:33.974 --> 09:35.876
I'm going back
to the office.

09:35.909 --> 09:38.411
I need to
get back to work.

09:38.445 --> 09:40.648
Denise said
Mark and Jerrie

09:40.681 --> 09:42.115
have been picking up
the slack for me.

09:42.149 --> 09:43.316
They got you covered.

09:43.350 --> 09:44.952
Yeah. I know.

09:44.985 --> 09:47.254
I just -- I need to
do something.

09:47.287 --> 09:49.556
It's that
work-ethic thing.

09:49.589 --> 09:51.892
Got it from my dad.

09:53.426 --> 09:55.395
You sure you're ready?

09:55.428 --> 09:58.165
I won't know until I try,
so we'll see, I guess.

10:01.134 --> 10:03.170
Thank you.

10:03.203 --> 10:04.638
For everything.

10:04.672 --> 10:06.173
Of course.

10:08.208 --> 10:10.510
You need to be careful, Jenny.

10:11.679 --> 10:13.446
Trying.

10:17.718 --> 10:19.586
Jerrie: No, I can't promise
we'll take your case,

10:19.619 --> 10:21.454
but you can set up
an appointment.

10:21.488 --> 10:22.923
More backlog.
Mm-hmm.

10:24.792 --> 10:27.160
"Cheating spouse."
"Cheating spouse."
Mm-hmm.

10:27.194 --> 10:28.528
What's this?
"Retail amnesia"?

10:28.561 --> 10:30.197
Oh,
that's a good one.

10:30.230 --> 10:32.132
So, she thinks that
one of her children

10:32.165 --> 10:34.201
has been using her
credit card to shop online,

10:34.234 --> 10:35.869
but her husband
claims it's her.

10:37.137 --> 10:39.106
Not only does this sound
kind of fun,

10:39.139 --> 10:40.974
but I think maybe
I suffer from this.

10:41.008 --> 10:42.810
You do, hmm?
I think so.

10:42.843 --> 10:44.311
Well...

10:44.344 --> 10:46.146
Hayden, honey,
what are you doing here?

10:47.514 --> 10:50.517
H-H-Have you heard
from my dad?

10:50.550 --> 10:52.285
No.

10:52.319 --> 10:53.620
Why?

10:53.653 --> 10:55.388
What's going on?

10:57.725 --> 10:59.659
You heard about Mason,
my brother?

10:59.693 --> 11:02.796
Yeah. I did.
I'm so sorry, honey.

11:02.830 --> 11:05.032
The police --
Jenny, Justin's mom --

11:05.065 --> 11:06.233
said it
was an overdose,

11:06.266 --> 11:08.802
and my dad's in denial
that he was using.

11:10.203 --> 11:13.406
Anyways, last night,
he disappeared.

11:15.608 --> 11:17.210
Disappeared?

11:17.244 --> 11:18.645
Didn't come home.

11:18.678 --> 11:19.913
Left his phone, too.

11:19.947 --> 11:22.049
Okay, that's concerning.

11:22.082 --> 11:23.650
My mom said
you used to be his sponsor,

11:23.683 --> 11:25.886
and last time, when things
got bad, he came to you,

11:25.919 --> 11:28.555
and I just --
I thought maybe...

11:28.588 --> 11:30.090
Yeah.

11:30.123 --> 11:31.491
What do you think
happened?

11:34.261 --> 11:36.830
The gun in his safe
is gone.

11:36.864 --> 11:38.165
I think
he could have hurt himself.

11:38.198 --> 11:39.933
Oh, no.

11:39.967 --> 11:41.935
Did you
call the police?

11:41.969 --> 11:43.436
And tell them what?

11:45.438 --> 11:47.908
Can you help me find him?

11:47.941 --> 11:50.577
We'll see
what we can do.

11:50.610 --> 11:53.013
We'll need a recent photograph
and some information first.

11:53.046 --> 11:55.015
Did he bring
his wallet with him?

11:55.048 --> 11:57.617
I-I -- I think so.
Why?

11:57.650 --> 12:00.587
We can start there.
Track his ATM and credit cards.

12:02.890 --> 12:04.424
Thank you.

12:04.457 --> 12:06.259
It's gonna be okay.

12:06.293 --> 12:09.562
You came to
the right place, okay?

12:09.596 --> 12:11.098
Jenny: I saw the truck,
and I just knew.

12:11.131 --> 12:12.632
Jenny, you
could've been killed.

12:12.665 --> 12:14.067
We need to go back
right now,

12:14.101 --> 12:15.268
pull a warrant,
and raid that lab.

12:15.302 --> 12:16.603
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Warrant?

12:16.636 --> 12:18.038
You brought me
no physical evidence.

12:18.071 --> 12:19.606
The evidence
is there.

12:19.639 --> 12:21.041
We just need to go back
and seize it --
Listen.

12:21.074 --> 12:22.442
...before they have
a chance to move it.

12:22.475 --> 12:24.277
I want these people to go down
as much as you do.

12:24.311 --> 12:26.313
Then do the right thing.
Pull a warrant.

12:26.346 --> 12:28.481
Jenny, if I go in there with
a flimsy warrant and we whiff,

12:28.515 --> 12:30.250
it could mean
my job and yours.

12:30.283 --> 12:33.620
A kid -- Mason Ford --
is dead.

12:33.653 --> 12:35.555
Others are gonna die.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.991
We need to stop them.

12:41.995 --> 12:44.965
Are you absolutely sure
the evidence is there?

12:44.998 --> 12:46.499
I wouldn't ask otherwise.

12:48.301 --> 12:49.736
Alright, I'll get you
your warrant.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.138
Go assemble a team.
Thank you.

12:55.042 --> 12:57.845
Poor Hayden.

12:57.878 --> 13:00.113
Lose her brother, then have
her father spin out.

13:00.147 --> 13:03.316
Must be awful.

13:03.350 --> 13:04.818
I hope we're not
wasting our time here.

13:04.852 --> 13:07.587
The manager said he would've
seen Richard come in.

13:07.620 --> 13:09.522
Maybe we should
go by his work again. Please.

13:09.556 --> 13:12.125
The manager was so stoned, he
wouldn't see a tornado go by.

13:12.159 --> 13:14.761
Richard's
had a unit here for two years,

13:14.794 --> 13:18.031
and then the only hit on his
credit card was a block away?

13:18.065 --> 13:19.199
That can't be
a coincidence.

13:19.232 --> 13:21.201
Oh. I see how it is.

13:21.234 --> 13:22.702
Dropping knowledge.

13:22.735 --> 13:24.972
You got
something better?

13:25.005 --> 13:26.974
No.
Alright, then.

13:27.007 --> 13:28.541
Follow my lead.

13:28.575 --> 13:29.977
Happily.

13:31.644 --> 13:32.946
Look.

14:01.374 --> 14:01.574
Hello?

14:02.876 --> 14:04.077
Buddy.

14:06.046 --> 14:09.016
Hey, hey, no, no, no. We're --
We're not gonna hurt you.

14:09.049 --> 14:10.583
We're --
We're here to help.

14:10.617 --> 14:12.719
Ah.

14:12.752 --> 14:14.421
Ahh.
You good?

14:14.454 --> 14:15.855
What happened?

14:15.889 --> 14:17.490
My friend Mason's dad
grabbed me

14:17.524 --> 14:19.259
and started asking
all these questions.

14:19.292 --> 14:21.061
About what?

14:21.094 --> 14:22.829
He wanted to know
who sold Mason the drugs.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.232
And what'd you say?

14:25.265 --> 14:26.866
I told him to ask
around the Boot Heel.

14:26.900 --> 14:29.202
That's where
most people get their stuff.

14:31.038 --> 14:32.572
Looks like we're going
to the Boot Heel.

14:38.645 --> 14:40.713
Dhruv is dead?

14:40.747 --> 14:45.785
Yes, but no one took
anything from the lab.

14:45.818 --> 14:49.722
Distribution won't be, uh...disrupted.

14:51.925 --> 14:54.061
<i>Waheguru.</i>

14:56.263 --> 14:59.232
<i>Waheguru.</i>

15:03.003 --> 15:05.205
Uh, where was his backup?

15:05.238 --> 15:08.375
Why weren't the security camera
installed?

15:08.408 --> 15:10.710
It was on my list.
I was gonna get it done.

15:10.743 --> 15:13.713
No, Jagat, I don't want to
hear your excuses.

15:13.746 --> 15:17.550
I was wrong to
put you in charge.

15:17.584 --> 15:19.786
You're not ready.

15:19.819 --> 15:23.556
D-Dhruv was
a -- a brother to you.

15:23.590 --> 15:25.959
Now his blood
is on your hands.

15:28.528 --> 15:30.563
Ren, I think I should
excuse myself.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.532
No, Mister Stone.

15:33.866 --> 15:37.670
You will step into Dhruv's
position and provide security.

15:37.704 --> 15:39.506
Especially since
we don't have a suspect.

15:39.539 --> 15:40.440
It could be anyone.

15:41.608 --> 15:45.278
If it's the Kapoors,
that's, like...not good.

15:45.312 --> 15:46.579
Yeah, we don't know that.

15:46.613 --> 15:48.781
Montana's not
that far away.

15:48.815 --> 15:51.118
Why would they
be in the lab?

15:51.151 --> 15:52.519
I don't know.

15:52.552 --> 15:53.853
Then let's not jump
to conclusions.

15:53.886 --> 15:56.156
Stone...look into it.

15:58.325 --> 16:00.460
Nobody move! Spread out!
Sheriff's Department!
Don't move!

16:00.493 --> 16:02.595
You heard him --
Sheriff's Department!

16:02.629 --> 16:04.864
What the hell is going on?
Hands where we can see 'em!

16:04.897 --> 16:06.599
We have a warrant
to search your property.

16:09.502 --> 16:11.771
Told you I'd see you soon.

16:11.804 --> 16:14.007
Sweep the house.
We'll check the basement.

16:14.041 --> 16:16.609
- Taking bedroom.
- Kitchen.

16:23.883 --> 16:26.053
Hey, how you doing?

16:26.086 --> 16:27.220
We're looking for somebody.

16:27.254 --> 16:29.156
Think he might have
stopped by here.

16:29.189 --> 16:30.690
Uh,
have you seen him?

16:33.193 --> 16:34.727
Who wants to know?

16:34.761 --> 16:36.196
Uh,
we're friends of his.

16:36.229 --> 16:37.964
Well, then
you can pay for the damage.

16:37.997 --> 16:40.233
He did this?
Yep.

16:40.267 --> 16:43.470
Came in here talking trash about
someone selling his kid drugs.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.538
Punched Jon Jon in the face.

16:45.572 --> 16:47.074
My guys went to throw him out

16:47.107 --> 16:49.008
when he broke down blubbering,
the whole works.

16:49.042 --> 16:50.510
Mm.
His son just died.

16:50.543 --> 16:52.312
I'm aware.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.814
It's a terrible thing,
the loss of a child.

16:54.847 --> 16:57.317
It's why he wasn't
hurt too bad.

16:57.350 --> 16:59.286
Any chance his son
bought the drugs here?

17:00.787 --> 17:02.522
Who are you again?

17:02.555 --> 17:04.657
We're private investigators
from Dewell and Hoyt.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.526
Richard Ford's part of
a case we're working.

17:06.559 --> 17:08.228
So you work
for those two psycho bitches

17:08.261 --> 17:10.263
that drew down
on my nephew and me

17:10.297 --> 17:12.599
in my own parking lot
the night before he died?

17:14.767 --> 17:17.670
We think this man could be
a danger to himself.

17:17.704 --> 17:19.606
Just tell us where you think
he might have gone.

17:19.639 --> 17:21.541
I got no idea.

17:21.574 --> 17:24.511
Now, I think you should
get out of my bar.

17:42.729 --> 17:44.030
Damn it.

17:44.063 --> 17:45.232
We're too late.

17:49.169 --> 17:50.770
They cleaned it all up.

17:50.803 --> 17:52.139
They must've known
we were coming.

17:53.340 --> 17:55.875
Careful what you say
out loud, alright?

17:55.908 --> 17:58.445
Just execute the warrant.
We will talk in private.

18:01.348 --> 18:02.782
Find what
you were looking for?

18:02.815 --> 18:05.152
Oh, I will.
I promise you that.

18:06.353 --> 18:07.854
What happened to
your face?

18:09.356 --> 18:12.225
My boxing workout
got a little intense.

18:12.259 --> 18:13.626
You should see
the other guy.

18:15.262 --> 18:15.995
Now, if you don't mind,

18:16.028 --> 18:17.630
I got a job to do.

18:17.664 --> 18:21.401
Sure.
Searching an empty basement.

18:21.434 --> 18:23.503
It's very important work.

18:33.446 --> 18:36.749
First Dhruv, now this.

18:38.951 --> 18:40.687
This is a mistake.

18:40.720 --> 18:42.155
What do you mean?

18:42.189 --> 18:43.590
Montana.

18:43.623 --> 18:46.626
Reenu. Jagat.

18:46.659 --> 18:48.495
We didn't have a choice,
remember?

18:48.528 --> 18:50.163
Fresh start.

18:50.197 --> 18:51.598
Get away from
the Kapoors.

18:51.631 --> 18:54.301
The Kapoors are
a bunch of street thugs

18:54.334 --> 18:55.768
without principles,

18:55.802 --> 18:57.870
and now <i>I'm</i>
running from <i>them?</i>

19:00.873 --> 19:03.676
It's a new world, babe.

19:03.710 --> 19:05.312
Be patient.

19:05.345 --> 19:08.047
Your enemies think that
you've been weakened.

19:08.080 --> 19:10.116
Let them believe that.

19:10.149 --> 19:13.152
Stay in the shadows
until it's clear

19:13.186 --> 19:14.654
who your real
friends and foes are,

19:14.687 --> 19:16.656
then strike.

19:16.689 --> 19:18.325
When you rise up,

19:18.358 --> 19:21.728
you will be more powerful
than ever in this new world.

19:29.202 --> 19:30.803
I'm lost.

19:35.007 --> 19:40.513
Tell me...
what do we do?

19:40.547 --> 19:44.251
Well, for starters,
we could use a "friend"

19:44.284 --> 19:46.919
in the local law enforcement community.

19:46.953 --> 19:48.321
Yeah, we --
we had a friend,

19:48.355 --> 19:50.823
and he was then killed
on Reenu's watch.

19:50.857 --> 19:54.093
Okay, just careful
with the blame thing.

19:54.126 --> 19:57.163
People need to be held
accountable for their actions.

19:57.196 --> 20:01.268
Yes,
but Jag and Ren

20:01.301 --> 20:03.270
don't need any more
reasons to resent you.

20:03.303 --> 20:04.437
Resent?

20:06.072 --> 20:09.442
Sorry.
Wrong word.

20:09.476 --> 20:11.177
Fear, maybe.

20:13.913 --> 20:15.582
You saying my children
don't love me?

20:15.615 --> 20:17.684
Fear and love.

20:17.717 --> 20:19.252
A little bit of both.

20:19.286 --> 20:20.920
Yeah, well,
they are my children,

20:20.953 --> 20:23.423
and they will do
as I say.

20:23.456 --> 20:25.024
I'm not so sure
about that.

20:29.095 --> 20:31.030
I had a dream,

20:31.063 --> 20:33.366
and it wasn't really
a dream --

20:33.400 --> 20:36.469
it was more like
a vibe premonition thingy.

20:36.503 --> 20:39.205
But --
Don't start
with this nonsense.

20:39.238 --> 20:40.573
Not now.

20:43.276 --> 20:46.078
Are you really sure

20:46.112 --> 20:49.081
that you don't want
to hear about it?

20:49.115 --> 20:51.418
You're going to tell me anyway.
Go ahead.

20:55.288 --> 20:56.823
When you die...

20:59.258 --> 21:00.993
...it will be at the hand
of your child.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.232
Oh.

21:06.265 --> 21:08.100
So, my children
will kill me?

21:08.134 --> 21:10.069
This is your --
This is your vibe?

21:10.102 --> 21:11.771
No.

21:11.804 --> 21:14.674
I said <i>a</i> child.

21:14.707 --> 21:15.642
Your son.

21:39.666 --> 21:40.633
Cassie: Hey.

21:42.702 --> 21:43.970
Mm.

21:45.204 --> 21:46.539
Hey.

21:46.573 --> 21:47.840
Hi.

21:47.874 --> 21:49.876
Uh, you good?

21:49.909 --> 21:52.445
I'm back.

21:52.479 --> 21:54.313
Don't know about good.
Let's see how it goes.

21:54.347 --> 21:56.516
I like your hair,
by the way.

21:56.549 --> 21:58.385
Thanks.

21:58.418 --> 22:00.152
Hey, Cass.

22:05.658 --> 22:07.794
I, uh --
I got you lunch.

22:07.827 --> 22:09.529
You did?
Yeah.

22:09.562 --> 22:10.963
Just in case.

22:10.997 --> 22:12.999
Okay.

22:13.032 --> 22:15.368
We've got chorizo tacos,
extra jalapeños.

22:15.402 --> 22:18.471
Oh, yes.
Hot and spicy, like <i>moi.</i>

22:18.505 --> 22:20.172
A plain cheese quesadilla
for the 5-year-old.

22:20.206 --> 22:22.074
Hey,
I like what I like.

22:22.108 --> 22:25.678
And you got your pick
of the salad or the tamales.

22:25.712 --> 22:27.046
Ooh, tamales.

22:27.079 --> 22:28.214
Denise:
Uh, just for the record,

22:28.247 --> 22:30.082
I did not tell Jerrie
to get you lunch,

22:30.116 --> 22:34.554
because I don't think that
you need to be back here yet.

22:36.589 --> 22:38.257
Okay, you guys, no.

22:38.290 --> 22:40.993
This isn't gonna work.

22:41.027 --> 22:42.429
Can we just,
like, do normal?

22:42.462 --> 22:44.196
I know that
it's not normal,

22:44.230 --> 22:45.432
and I'm not gonna lie
and, um --

22:45.465 --> 22:47.333
and pretend like
everything's perfectly fine,

22:47.366 --> 22:49.035
'cause it's not.

22:50.036 --> 22:52.839
It's gonna take time,
alright?

22:52.872 --> 22:55.207
I need to stay busy.

22:55.241 --> 22:58.244
So, here I am.
What are we working on?

23:04.717 --> 23:05.918
Thank you.

23:05.952 --> 23:07.520
Um...okay.

23:07.554 --> 23:09.689
I have feelers out
for Scarlet and Phoebe.

23:09.722 --> 23:11.891
Figure they have to
resurface at some point.

23:11.924 --> 23:13.560
Yeah, definitely.
Keep me posted.

23:13.593 --> 23:15.094
And we got a new case.

23:15.127 --> 23:17.129
A missing person --
Richard Ford.

23:17.163 --> 23:18.898
Uh, his son just died
of a drug overdose.

23:18.931 --> 23:20.700
Mason Ford.

23:20.733 --> 23:22.134
Jenny told me about him.

23:22.168 --> 23:24.771
Yeah, well,
his sister hired the firm.

23:24.804 --> 23:27.306
Their father beat up
a friend of Mason's,

23:27.339 --> 23:29.308
started a fight
at the Boot Heel Bar.

23:29.341 --> 23:31.644
He was trying to find out
where the drugs came from.

23:33.345 --> 23:36.282
Look, I've known Richard
a really long time,

23:36.315 --> 23:37.917
and he is not a bad man.

23:37.950 --> 23:39.652
I mean,
he's obviously grieving.

23:39.686 --> 23:42.822
Mm, I think we're
a scooch past grieving.

23:42.855 --> 23:45.658
Hayden's worried that
he may hurt himself,

23:45.692 --> 23:47.093
and we have no leads
to where he may be.

23:48.961 --> 23:51.998
If I were him,
I'd want to be with my son.

23:52.031 --> 23:53.432
This is gonna sound weird,

23:53.466 --> 23:55.935
but being back here
where my dad died

23:55.968 --> 23:57.937
is kind of comforting.

24:02.141 --> 24:04.110
That helps.

24:04.143 --> 24:05.578
It does?

24:05.612 --> 24:07.614
I think I know
where he might be.

24:07.647 --> 24:08.681
You wanna come?

24:08.715 --> 24:11.017
Um, let me go.

24:12.519 --> 24:14.120
Please?

24:14.153 --> 24:15.788
I know how to
get through to Richard.

24:19.391 --> 24:20.827
Let me know how it goes.

24:20.860 --> 24:23.429
Will do.

24:41.648 --> 24:43.349
Lindor: Go easy.

24:52.925 --> 24:55.728
Richard.

24:55.762 --> 24:57.697
I am so sorry.

24:57.730 --> 24:58.865
Richard: Denise?

25:01.033 --> 25:02.234
Mm.

25:03.536 --> 25:05.037
Wh--
Why are you here?

25:05.071 --> 25:07.206
Well, everyone's
looking for you.

25:07.239 --> 25:09.709
This is Mark Lindor. He works
for Dewell and Hoyt right now.

25:11.043 --> 25:12.645
Just here to help.

25:12.679 --> 25:14.847
Hayden hired the firm
when you disappeared.

25:14.881 --> 25:17.684
We've all been
really worried about you.

25:17.717 --> 25:19.051
How'd you find me?

25:19.085 --> 25:20.820
Well,
you left quite a trail --

25:20.853 --> 25:22.989
Boot Heel Bar
and your storage unit.

25:23.022 --> 25:24.824
What were you thinking?

25:24.857 --> 25:28.160
I was trying to f-find out
where Mason got those drugs,

25:28.194 --> 25:30.229
but everyone just
gave me the runaround,

25:30.262 --> 25:32.264
everyone pointing fingers
somewhere else,

25:32.298 --> 25:36.068
rumors about some new
drug cartel selling fentanyl --

25:36.102 --> 25:37.904
You cannot focus
on all of that.

25:37.937 --> 25:41.273
You need to think about
your family, okay?

25:41.307 --> 25:43.576
Mona and Hayden.

25:43.610 --> 25:47.446
You're lucky the kid you grabbed
doesn't want to press charges.

25:47.479 --> 25:49.381
I'll make it right.
I'll call his parents.

25:49.415 --> 25:52.885
I'm gonna -- I'm gonna
put everything right.

25:54.621 --> 25:56.088
You have my word.

25:56.122 --> 25:57.924
Just talk to Hayden, okay?

25:57.957 --> 25:59.726
She's devastated
about her brother,

25:59.759 --> 26:01.728
and, well,
you've made her worried sick,

26:01.761 --> 26:02.895
the poor thing.

26:02.929 --> 26:05.698
I'm sorry
for all that.

26:05.732 --> 26:07.133
I'm gonna go home.

26:07.166 --> 26:08.701
It's okay.
We understand.

26:08.735 --> 26:10.603
I'm just so glad
that you're safe.

26:12.839 --> 26:15.441
Yeah.

26:19.145 --> 26:21.580
Thank you...

26:21.614 --> 26:23.082
for everything.

26:25.785 --> 26:27.720
Oh, and, um...

26:27.754 --> 26:29.288
You don't
have to call Hayden.

26:29.321 --> 26:31.090
I'll, uh --
I'll take care of it.

26:35.127 --> 26:37.764
I miss our weekly
pie and coffee meetings.

26:37.797 --> 26:39.331
Well,
we can do that again.

26:39.365 --> 26:41.267
Anytime.

26:41.300 --> 26:43.502
I'd like that.

26:47.506 --> 26:49.008
They knew
there would be a raid,

26:49.041 --> 26:50.476
had everything cleared out
before we even

26:50.509 --> 26:52.244
stepped foot
on the property.

26:52.278 --> 26:53.913
He tipped them off.

26:53.946 --> 26:55.481
Who?

26:58.885 --> 27:01.120
Travis.

27:01.153 --> 27:02.521
Jenny,
you don't know that.

27:02.554 --> 27:04.190
Nothing you can do about it, anyway,

27:04.223 --> 27:07.259
so just leave Travis in
the grass until we know more.

27:07.293 --> 27:09.996
Today,
we take the loss.

27:10.029 --> 27:12.331
Enough heads are
gonna roll for that.

27:12.364 --> 27:14.867
Look, I'm sorry.

27:14.901 --> 27:16.335
It was a lock.
It was all there.

27:16.368 --> 27:18.304
I knew what I saw.
It's not your fault.

27:18.337 --> 27:19.438
I'm the one who made
the call to go in there

27:19.471 --> 27:21.107
with a wafer-thin
warrant.

27:21.140 --> 27:23.042
A crappy warrant won't matter
if we nail them.

27:23.075 --> 27:24.877
Poppernak: Hey, boss.

27:24.911 --> 27:26.545
Other boss.
Sorry to interrupt.

27:26.578 --> 27:28.280
What is it?

27:28.314 --> 27:30.016
Yeah, we got a line on one
of those Reed Colfax trucks.

27:30.049 --> 27:31.818
The ones you said you saw
at the Bhullars'.

27:31.851 --> 27:33.385
Where is it?

27:33.419 --> 27:34.887
Deputy Miles pulled one over
on MacDonald Pass,

27:34.921 --> 27:36.222
headed out of town.

27:38.257 --> 27:39.558
Let's go see what
the Bhullars are hiding.

27:39.591 --> 27:40.893
Go.

27:43.996 --> 27:47.834
Donno:
We questioned every dealer
and connect moving our drugs.

27:47.867 --> 27:49.836
This doesn't
make any sense.

27:49.869 --> 27:51.670
We thought they were crushing
the pills and cutting them,

27:51.704 --> 27:53.973
but they said the pills
were hitting the street as is.

27:54.006 --> 27:56.075
Which makes us look
cheap and desperate.

27:56.108 --> 27:58.244
Why is this so complicated?

27:58.277 --> 28:00.046
We've eliminated
all of our enemies in Helena.

28:00.079 --> 28:01.680
Our associates have nothing
to do with this.

28:01.714 --> 28:03.750
There is a loose thread somewhere.

28:03.783 --> 28:04.717
Veer: Reenu?

28:06.118 --> 28:08.721
Where's Jagat?

28:08.755 --> 28:10.656
He's talking to Dhruv's

28:10.689 --> 28:13.592
helping with funeral
arrangements in Punjab.

28:13.625 --> 28:14.693
His mother.

28:16.595 --> 28:18.364
My heart aches
for her loss.

28:19.899 --> 28:22.201
It's a disgrace we haven't
found his killer yet.

28:23.369 --> 28:26.038
What do you know about
that Barbie doll cop

28:26.072 --> 28:27.840
that keeps
showing up here?

28:27.874 --> 28:30.509
The deputy?
Yep. Her.

28:30.542 --> 28:33.345
Nothing, other than
she got away with squat.

28:33.379 --> 28:35.214
No, that's not what
I'm talking about.

28:35.247 --> 28:36.682
She looked like
she'd been in a fight.

28:36.715 --> 28:39.685
Yeah?
Did she kill Dhruv?

28:39.718 --> 28:41.620
I don't -- I don't
see that as a possibility.

28:41.653 --> 28:43.722
Well, you might not see everything.

28:43.756 --> 28:48.294
Dhruv is dead, we have nothing
on how that happened,

28:48.327 --> 28:51.130
and Annie Oakley just
walks in here right after?

28:51.163 --> 28:53.365
It just seems unlikely,
given Dhruv's size, don't --

28:53.399 --> 28:55.134
Even if it's not her,
she's gonna be trouble.

28:55.167 --> 28:56.969
I know girls
just like her --

28:57.003 --> 29:00.807
annoying, little problem that
we're gonna have to deal with.

29:00.840 --> 29:02.975
We just need to be prepared
for her to show up.

29:03.009 --> 29:04.944
We eliminate
the problem.

29:07.346 --> 29:10.817
Mr. Stone, can you
handle that for us?

29:10.850 --> 29:12.718
We need to think about
the consequences first --

29:12.751 --> 29:15.087
Can you handle it
for us?

29:15.121 --> 29:17.123
Handle it how, exactly?

29:17.156 --> 29:19.591
You take Donno
with you.

29:19.625 --> 29:20.659
He knows how.

29:29.335 --> 29:30.602
This your rig?

29:30.636 --> 29:32.171
Bryce:
It's the one I'm driving.

29:32.204 --> 29:34.173
I wouldn't call it
my pride and joy.

29:34.206 --> 29:35.607
Open it.

29:47.719 --> 29:49.188
Officer: Clear.

29:55.061 --> 29:58.630
Montana shorthorn.
Those are grade A cuts.

29:58.664 --> 30:00.199
That's the best you can get.

30:01.834 --> 30:03.936
Miles, what did the weigh
station say he's hauling?

30:03.970 --> 30:06.538
40,000, all in.

30:06.572 --> 30:08.975
All this beef and
you're only scaling at 40,000?

30:09.008 --> 30:11.343
Seems light.

30:22.889 --> 30:24.857
Hey, c'mon, lady,
that's prime product there.

30:34.366 --> 30:37.503
Prime product, indeed.

30:39.571 --> 30:40.839
<i>♪ Focus like a telescope</i>

30:40.873 --> 30:41.908
<i>♪ I'm toxic like an envelope</i>

30:41.941 --> 30:43.209
<i>♪ My fist in your head</i>

30:43.242 --> 30:44.810
<i>♪ My hammer in a cantaloupe</i>

30:44.843 --> 30:46.078
♪ Got the antidote
for your sickness ♪

30:46.112 --> 30:48.347
♪ God is my witness

30:48.380 --> 30:50.149
♪ I got something for you
snitches in any situation ♪

30:51.884 --> 30:54.520
"Bound to carve it in your chest
so you don't forget my name."

30:57.856 --> 30:59.926
That was my friend's
favorite line.

30:59.959 --> 31:01.593
Blitzkrieg, right?

31:01.627 --> 31:03.329
Still rides hard.

31:03.362 --> 31:05.831
My class ran late.
I swear.

31:05.864 --> 31:08.600
Sweetheart, nobody's checking
your timecard.

31:08.634 --> 31:11.403
Timecards.
That's an interesting idea.

31:12.538 --> 31:14.840
Am I in trouble?

31:14.873 --> 31:16.675
Come on over.

31:16.708 --> 31:17.743
Let's have a chat.

31:27.086 --> 31:29.521
Hey, thanks for dinner.

31:29.555 --> 31:32.291
Next one's on me.
Sounds good to me.

31:32.324 --> 31:35.594
So, are you gonna keep
cosplaying as a PI, or what?

31:36.929 --> 31:38.630
Uh,
if you'll have me.

31:38.664 --> 31:40.132
You sure that's wise?

31:40.166 --> 31:41.900
Considering you were just
shot not too long ago?

31:41.934 --> 31:45.904
See, usually, when someone's
offered medical leave,

31:45.938 --> 31:48.074
they don't use the time off
to work another gig.

31:48.107 --> 31:49.608
Right.

31:49.641 --> 31:51.710
Well, look,
I can only meditate

31:51.743 --> 31:53.279
and take nature walks
for so long. Mm.

31:53.312 --> 31:55.982
I mean, idleness
is not my friend.

31:56.015 --> 31:57.483
Fair enough.

31:57.516 --> 31:59.151
You know,
I can't complain.

32:01.753 --> 32:03.755
I've enjoyed spending time
with you these last couple days.

32:06.925 --> 32:08.627
Feeling is mutual.

32:13.432 --> 32:14.466
Do you wanna
come inside?

32:18.870 --> 32:20.272
Um...
Oh.

32:20.306 --> 32:22.574
Okay.

32:22.608 --> 32:24.410
Why do I feel like
I just put my foot in my mouth?

32:24.443 --> 32:26.345
No. No, you didn't.

32:26.378 --> 32:28.947
I'm sorry.
I, uh...

32:30.616 --> 32:32.951
Uh, I am not very good
at this sort of thing.

32:32.985 --> 32:34.520
What sort of thing?

32:34.553 --> 32:37.256
I don't know.
Interpersonal relationships.

32:41.293 --> 32:44.263
So, are you and Cassie
together now --

32:44.296 --> 32:45.964
interpersonally?

32:48.367 --> 32:50.369
I don't know.

32:50.402 --> 32:51.803
I don't know what we are.

32:51.837 --> 32:54.706
Or how to feel
about any of this.

32:59.078 --> 33:02.981
I have feelings for you,
but I --

33:03.015 --> 33:05.984
this whole situation
with you and Cassie

33:06.018 --> 33:08.687
and everything that went down
with Ronald and...

33:10.689 --> 33:12.791
I don't know
which way is up anymore.

33:12.824 --> 33:15.194
Okay. Well.

33:15.227 --> 33:16.895
Sounds like
you got a choice to make.

33:19.865 --> 33:22.534
See you
at the office.

33:31.610 --> 33:33.045
You have
nothing to worry about.

33:33.079 --> 33:34.746
Just tell us
who cut the drugs, Ronit.

33:34.780 --> 33:36.582
It wasn't me. I swear.
You gotta believe me.

33:36.615 --> 33:38.217
This is a complete
waste of time.

33:38.250 --> 33:39.251
If no one
cut the drugs outside,

33:39.285 --> 33:41.187
then it had to
come from in here.

33:41.220 --> 33:44.990
It wasn't me.
I promise.

33:45.023 --> 33:46.892
Maybe Donno can persuade him.
Do you know where he is?

33:46.925 --> 33:48.394
No. No, wait.

33:53.465 --> 33:55.367
It was your father.

33:59.638 --> 34:02.441
Really?
Yeah.

34:02.474 --> 34:04.210
Your -- Your -- Your dad
told me to cut the pills.

34:04.243 --> 34:06.245
Okay.
Why would he do that?

34:06.278 --> 34:08.347
I don't know.
I-I just do what I'm told.

34:08.380 --> 34:10.349
Do you believe this?

34:10.382 --> 34:12.884
He told me he'd pay
for my student loans.

34:12.918 --> 34:14.553
Don't tell him
I told you, okay?

34:14.586 --> 34:15.587
He'll kill me.

34:20.459 --> 34:22.928
Do you like ice cream?

34:22.961 --> 34:24.896
What?
Ice cream.

34:24.930 --> 34:26.898
Let's go get some.
Take a little walk.

34:26.932 --> 34:28.300
I'm lactose intolerant.

34:28.334 --> 34:30.302
Well, we'll get you
some acai.

34:30.336 --> 34:31.303
Okay.

34:32.638 --> 34:34.106
Why?

34:34.140 --> 34:35.474
Just to get to
know each other,

34:35.507 --> 34:37.042
a little employee-employer
relations.

34:37.075 --> 34:38.810
HR.

34:38.844 --> 34:40.412
Are you gonna kill me?

34:43.849 --> 34:46.051
I haven't decided yet.

34:57.529 --> 34:59.131
Jenny: <i>So, drivers
don't pack their truck,</i>

34:59.165 --> 35:00.632
<i>they just transport.</i>

35:00.666 --> 35:02.668
<i>Right,
and I'm just a driver,</i>

35:02.701 --> 35:04.803
<i>so anything you found
has nothing to do with me.</i>

35:04.836 --> 35:06.004
Who's your
point of contact?

35:11.843 --> 35:14.480
Either of these guys
look familiar?

35:23.322 --> 35:25.591
What about this guy?

35:25.624 --> 35:27.493
Have any dealings
with him?

35:29.328 --> 35:32.097
Y'know,
Deputy Pumpernickel here,

35:32.130 --> 35:33.699
he offered me
some hot chocolate.

35:33.732 --> 35:35.434
Thank you, by the way.

35:35.467 --> 35:36.835
Could I have that now?

35:38.170 --> 35:40.372
With marshmallows,
please and thank you.

35:41.973 --> 35:43.942
It's actually
Deputy Poppernak.

35:43.975 --> 35:45.977
My grandfather's
Ukrainian.

35:46.011 --> 35:48.614
I'm gonna make this
real easy for you.

35:48.647 --> 35:50.015
If you give us nothing,

35:50.048 --> 35:53.385
then you go down
for the drugs.

35:53.419 --> 35:56.655
Might even be looking at
manslaughter for the overdoses.

35:58.089 --> 36:00.526
You're running drugs
for a family of thugs

36:00.559 --> 36:03.495
that would poison
every last person in this town

36:03.529 --> 36:05.797
if it was good
for their bottom line.

36:05.831 --> 36:07.999
Think about that
for a second.

36:08.033 --> 36:09.468
How does that
line up with

36:09.501 --> 36:12.204
the good ol' Montana boy
you pretend to be?

36:15.407 --> 36:17.576
Whatever money
they're giving you

36:17.609 --> 36:20.078
won't do you any good
behind bars.

36:21.012 --> 36:22.548
What do you want from me?

36:27.886 --> 36:30.689
I need
a man on the inside.

36:30.722 --> 36:34.593
Someone who knows movement,
who can watch and listen.

36:37.929 --> 36:40.566
So, what do you say,
Bryce?

36:40.599 --> 36:41.767
Can I count on you?

36:44.770 --> 36:46.438
Fine.

36:49.241 --> 36:51.510
You just earned yourself
some hot chocolate.

37:03.088 --> 37:04.923
Denise: Wow, gosh.

37:04.956 --> 37:08.093
Having a CI sounds
exciting and dangerous.

37:08.126 --> 37:09.561
Yeah, are you sure
about this?

37:09.595 --> 37:11.930
I know what you're thinking.
That this is risky.

37:11.963 --> 37:13.399
Oh, hard yes on that,
but then again,

37:13.432 --> 37:15.901
I wouldn't expect anything less
from you, so...

37:15.934 --> 37:17.603
Okay, on brand.
I-I'll own that.

37:17.636 --> 37:19.771
But I need evidence
against the Bhullars.

37:19.805 --> 37:21.573
And you're okay
if Travis goes down with them?

37:23.609 --> 37:25.311
That's on him.

37:25.344 --> 37:27.045
I did what I could.

37:27.078 --> 37:28.914
Copy you.

37:29.981 --> 37:32.117
Can I just say I love
having you both back here?

37:33.585 --> 37:35.120
Yeah, it does feel
like old times.

37:35.153 --> 37:36.588
You all wanna
go grab a bite?

37:36.622 --> 37:38.790
Aw, wish I could, but I have
my stupid book club tonight,

37:38.824 --> 37:40.759
and I'm the one
who chose the stupid book.

37:40.792 --> 37:42.894
And I wish I could, but I got
to get back to the office.

37:42.928 --> 37:44.396
Raincheck?
Yeah.

37:44.430 --> 37:45.731
