00:52.761 --> 00:54.855
Morning, Randy. Hi.

00:56.098 --> 00:57.645
- Morning. Morning.
- Good morning.

00:57.808 --> 00:59.481
Shelby. Caramel mocha.

00:59.643 --> 01:00.690
Judd. You rock.

01:00.852 --> 01:02.946
Thank you. I do rock, don't I?

01:03.522 --> 01:04.739
- Judd.
- Wade.

01:04.897 --> 01:07.151
Aw. Hydration.

01:07.317 --> 01:08.569
It's gonna get me through.

01:08.735 --> 01:10.237
- You ready?
- Let's do it.

01:10.404 --> 01:14.454
Now, I understand you're telling me that
you think it's gay to groom your privates.

01:14.616 --> 01:17.620
Now, are you having one of your buddies
help you run the razor?

01:17.786 --> 01:19.706
- Is that what's making it gay?
Ha-ha-ha.

01:19.913 --> 01:21.460
<i>Man Up.</i> What do you got?

01:21.623 --> 01:24.718
Now we got an NBA wife that's gonna
be suing her power-forward husband...

01:24.876 --> 01:28.050
...for half of everything
because he cheated on her.

01:28.213 --> 01:29.556
Now, here's the story, toots.

01:29.840 --> 01:31.763
Hold and turn down your radio, please.

01:31.925 --> 01:35.270
...Destroying dudes in the paint.
Foot and a half of rope in his pants.

01:35.429 --> 01:38.399
I am sending it in to him.
If he likes it, he'll pick up the phone.

01:38.557 --> 01:41.857
You don't get to be shocked when he gets
road tail in Cleveland at an away game.

01:42.019 --> 01:43.566
Stop chasing 10$.

01:43.937 --> 01:46.031
Bang a 4, bang a 5.

01:46.189 --> 01:50.615
Look at the gratitude on their face.
You be the best part of their year.

01:50.902 --> 01:53.246
Order like a man.
Can you do us all that favor?

01:53.405 --> 01:55.874
Get yourself a bourbon or a whiskey neat.

01:56.033 --> 01:57.535
Then why did you vote for him?!

01:58.035 --> 02:00.959
Why did you vote for him?! No one made you!
Did you get paid?!

02:01.121 --> 02:02.919
- Did someone give you $500?!
- Ha-ha-ha.

02:05.208 --> 02:08.211
Wade, great show. Can we go over
some syndication numbers, pal?

02:08.377 --> 02:10.175
Can we not do that now? I'm wiped, man.

02:10.339 --> 02:12.637
Gotta get home and take a nap.
I'll call you. Okay?

02:12.841 --> 02:16.061
Yeah, great. You go home. Get some rest.
I'll consolidate these for you.

02:16.219 --> 02:17.311
How'd it turn out?

02:17.471 --> 02:19.439
- She's gonna love it.
- Nice. Thank you for that.

02:19.598 --> 02:21.066
How soon can you get me out of here?

02:21.224 --> 02:23.602
Financials at 1.
I can have you home early by 3.

02:23.769 --> 02:25.396
- Promise?
- Promise.

02:32.986 --> 02:34.579
Quinn?

02:37.908 --> 02:38.909
Quinn.

02:39.076 --> 02:40.956
<i>Approachin' hoochies with a passion.</i>

02:41.078 --> 02:43.922
- Come on, baby, come on. Fuck! Quinn!
- Aah!

02:44.081 --> 02:45.333
- Oh, yeah, yeah!
- Oh!

02:45.499 --> 02:47.922
- Oh, shit!
- Harder! Yeah!

02:50.087 --> 02:53.091
Wade! Wade! Yeah! Unh!

02:57.511 --> 02:59.639
Would now be a great time to go over
those numbers?

02:59.805 --> 03:01.102
Oh, my God!

03:01.264 --> 03:02.766
- How long?
- Judd.

03:05.102 --> 03:06.149
- How long?!
- A year.

03:06.311 --> 03:08.109
This is the first time.

03:10.107 --> 03:12.109
On our sides.

03:13.610 --> 03:15.078
How long?

03:15.237 --> 03:16.614
A year, Judd.

04:30.520 --> 04:31.863
It's not a good time, Wendy.

04:32.189 --> 04:33.361
Dad's dead.

04:35.525 --> 04:36.868
What?

04:37.486 --> 04:39.284
He died about an hour ago.

04:39.488 --> 04:41.035
<i>No, no, no. Hang on.</i>

04:41.615 --> 04:43.538
They said that he had more time.

04:43.700 --> 04:45.498
Yeah, well, apparently he didn't.

04:46.244 --> 04:48.747
Shit. How's Mom?

04:50.415 --> 04:53.965
She's Mom. You know. She asked me
how much to tip the nurses.

04:54.127 --> 04:55.629
Listen, there's something else,

04:55.796 --> 04:57.719
Dad wants us to sit shiva.

04:59.508 --> 05:00.600
Dad's dead.

05:00.759 --> 05:03.228
Yeah. Apparently that's the optimal time
to do it.

05:03.386 --> 05:07.607
I asked them three times to remove this awful
tube. I mean, give the man his dignity.

05:07.766 --> 05:09.109
I don't understand the shiva.

05:09.267 --> 05:11.440
Mom's not even Jewish,
and Dad was an atheist.

05:11.603 --> 05:13.651
A Jewish atheist.
And this is what he wanted.

05:13.814 --> 05:15.441
I'm just gonna do it myself.

05:15.607 --> 05:17.905
No. It's okay, Mom. Let the nurses do it.

05:18.068 --> 05:19.661
What am I gonna do? Kill him?

05:19.820 --> 05:21.072
Mommy, leave it!

05:21.738 --> 05:25.663
I don't know, Judd. This is what he told Mom
he wanted. And Paul is on board with it.

05:25.826 --> 05:29.626
And I haven't managed to track down Phillip
yet. Hopefully, he'll check his texts.

05:29.788 --> 05:31.335
Okay.

05:31.957 --> 05:33.584
Jesus, fuck, Mom!

05:34.042 --> 05:35.419
It's better, don't you think?

05:35.585 --> 05:39.180
<i>Mommy, put him down.
Stop touching him.</i>

05:54.354 --> 05:56.197
- Judd.
- Hi, Mom.

05:56.857 --> 05:58.279
Where's Quinn, honey?

05:58.441 --> 06:01.320
She's got a bulging disk
because of a gym accident.

06:01.486 --> 06:03.327
- My God. Is she all right?
- She's fine.

06:03.363 --> 06:06.583
The doctors have her on pain medication.
She was devastated she couldn't be here.

06:06.741 --> 06:08.493
- No, of course.
- There he is, huh?

06:11.329 --> 06:13.832
- Mm.
- It's okay to cry, honey.

06:14.207 --> 06:16.380
- Thank you.
- Or laugh.

06:16.585 --> 06:19.304
- There's no correct response.
- Okay.

06:19.462 --> 06:24.514
I thought maybe I would just stand here
quietly in sad reflection. You know?

06:25.385 --> 06:26.853
- Linda.
- Hi, sweetie.

06:27.012 --> 06:28.605
- Hi.
- Hi.

06:28.763 --> 06:30.640
- Hey, Paul.
- Judd. How are you?

06:30.807 --> 06:33.651
- Hi, sweetheart.
- Hey, Judd. Hi.

06:33.810 --> 06:36.484
Hello. Look at this.

06:36.646 --> 06:38.819
Hi, sis. Got your hands full, huh?

06:40.483 --> 06:42.656
- A bulging disk? Seriously?
- Yep.

06:42.819 --> 06:44.696
You have to tell Mom about Quinn.

06:44.863 --> 06:47.036
I'm not ready yet.
What's different about her?

06:47.198 --> 06:50.702
It's the boobs. She had
a little touch-up.

06:50.869 --> 06:55.090
She's going on another book tour.
Twenty-fifth anniversary of <i>Cradle and All.</i>

06:55.248 --> 06:58.208
- God help us. Hey, Barry. Hey, pal.
- Just send the last iteration.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.932
- Seriously? Pay attention.
- Whoa. What, are you kidding me?

07:01.046 --> 07:02.926
Say hello to your brother-in-law.
He's bereaved.

07:03.089 --> 07:04.849
- Sorry, I didn't see you.
- Good to see you.

07:04.925 --> 07:08.520
- What's up, little man?
- Mommy said "shit" in the car.

07:08.678 --> 07:10.851
- "Shit"?
- Yeah.

07:11.181 --> 07:13.855
- Oh. Have you been drinking all day?
- Yeah.

07:14.017 --> 07:16.270
So we started out with a little booze
and profanity, Mom?

07:16.436 --> 07:17.688
Good morning, everybody.

07:18.021 --> 07:20.194
Mort Altman was not
a fan of ritual.

07:21.232 --> 07:24.406
So, in deference to him, I'm gonna
limit myself to a single psalm.

07:25.236 --> 07:26.362
Okay?

07:27.197 --> 07:30.201
The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

07:30.700 --> 07:32.327
He maketh me to lie down...

07:32.494 --> 07:34.622
<i>Shut 'em down, open up shop.</i>

07:34.788 --> 07:37.541
He maketh me
to lie down in green pastures.

07:37.707 --> 07:40.460
Shit! Shit, shit, shit.

07:40.627 --> 07:42.004
Shit, Shit, shit.

07:42.170 --> 07:43.467
Shit.

07:43.964 --> 07:45.216
Shit.

07:45.382 --> 07:48.056
Excuse me. Excuse me. Hey, Mr. Parker.

07:49.052 --> 07:51.430
- Mommy.
- Phillip. You came.

07:51.596 --> 07:52.939
Of course I came.

07:54.599 --> 07:57.398
Hey, hey. Low five, low five, low five.

07:58.395 --> 07:59.942
Koala Bear. Hey.

08:00.105 --> 08:02.073
- Hey, man.
- How you doing?

08:02.232 --> 08:04.155
- Nice ride.
- Yeah. Where's Quinn?

08:04.317 --> 08:07.571
- Are we all set? Do you mind if I keep going?
- Holy shit.

08:07.737 --> 08:08.738
Sorry, Boner.

08:08.905 --> 08:10.578
- No, Charlie. Rabbi Grodner.
- Shh.

08:10.740 --> 08:13.994
Nobody calls me "Boner" anymore.
That was a childhood nickname.

08:14.452 --> 08:15.920
So now we know that.

08:17.038 --> 08:18.631
Um...

08:18.790 --> 08:19.837
Apologies.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.800
Paul, Mort's eldest son,
will now say a few words.

08:25.797 --> 08:26.923
Boner is a man of God now?

08:27.090 --> 08:29.010
- That'll never stop being weird.
- Shh. Come on.

08:29.092 --> 08:31.436
I see Mom's new tits are present
and accounted for.

08:31.594 --> 08:32.811
- How about those?
- Hey.

08:33.263 --> 08:35.061
Sorry.

08:37.433 --> 08:38.936
Dad would've hated this funeral.

08:39.436 --> 08:41.316
That's just one of the things I loved
about him.

08:43.273 --> 08:46.618
He would've been counting the minutes
till he could go down the hill...

08:46.776 --> 08:48.778
...turn on the game, heh...

08:48.945 --> 08:52.745
...and then he just would've talked
about how full of shit everybody was, heh.

08:53.116 --> 08:54.834
They didn't really miss him.

08:55.869 --> 08:57.963
And he would've been wrong.

09:00.290 --> 09:02.042
We do miss him.

09:30.320 --> 09:31.663
Hey, man.

09:31.821 --> 09:33.994
- Hi, son.
- Hey, Mom.

09:41.498 --> 09:43.000
Hey, Sunflower.

09:43.666 --> 09:45.168
Hey, Horry.

09:53.510 --> 09:54.636
Hey, Horry.

09:54.803 --> 09:57.022
- Sorry about Mort, man.
- Yeah.

09:57.180 --> 09:59.933
Thanks, buddy. How you doing?

10:00.725 --> 10:02.193
Living the dream.

10:03.103 --> 10:05.526
Yeah. Good to see you.

10:09.818 --> 10:12.037
Oh, no.
No, no, Mom, you gotta be kidding me.

10:12.195 --> 10:14.948
- It's actually more comfortable than it looks.
- I doubt that.

10:15.115 --> 10:18.244
Wendy's kids are in Paul's room,
so I gave your room to Paul.

10:18.409 --> 10:19.456
Nice.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.589
Annie's ovulating,
and I figured they could use the privacy.

10:22.747 --> 10:25.000
Yeah. Well...

10:29.712 --> 10:33.057
Paul and Annie only live about a half hour
away. How come they have to sleep here?

10:33.216 --> 10:35.389
I want all my kids under one roof again.

10:35.718 --> 10:38.642
Obviously, when Quinn gets here,
we'll make different arrangements.

10:38.847 --> 10:42.067
- But this is okay, right?
- Yeah.

10:42.392 --> 10:43.735
- Yeah?
- It's good.

10:43.893 --> 10:45.361
- Be fine.
- Okay.

10:45.854 --> 10:47.572
- Come up soon.
- Okay.

10:47.730 --> 10:50.233
Visitors'll be here any minute.

10:57.574 --> 10:59.372
Judd, it's starting!

11:00.743 --> 11:01.915
You're shitting us, right?

11:02.078 --> 11:05.002
They're shiva chairs. You sit low
to the ground as a sign of mourning.

11:05.165 --> 11:06.337
That's why they're like that.

11:06.499 --> 11:10.003
- Don't some people sit shiva for three days?
- I've seen that. That's a thing.

11:10.170 --> 11:12.343
- It's not a thing.
- Maybe that could be our thing.

11:12.505 --> 11:15.475
- It can't be.
- They do it in California. We could pioneer that.

11:15.633 --> 11:17.977
We're not gonna pioneer it.
Nobody here's gonna pioneer it.

11:18.136 --> 11:20.309
The word "shiva" is Hebrew for "seven."

11:20.471 --> 11:23.850
Seven days, no work, no travel. Your ass
is in those seats. Those are the rules.

11:24.017 --> 11:25.537
I'd love to find the word for "three."

11:25.685 --> 11:27.733
- I don't think Dad...
- Stop it!

11:27.896 --> 11:30.866
This was your father's dying wish,
and you're negotiating?

11:31.024 --> 11:35.530
He was not a perfect man or a perfect father,
but he sure as hell was better than most.

11:35.695 --> 11:37.288
- Mom...
- No!

11:37.447 --> 11:41.042
Your father had one final request,
and we are gonna honor it.

11:41.201 --> 11:43.454
It's gonna be hard,
it's gonna be uncomfortable...

11:43.620 --> 11:45.421
...and we're gonna get
on each other's nerves.

11:45.580 --> 11:49.380
But for the next seven days,
you are all my children again.

11:49.542 --> 11:51.215
And you are all grounded.

11:57.467 --> 11:59.344
What are you waiting for? Come on.

11:59.510 --> 12:01.057
Yup. Any particular seat?

12:01.221 --> 12:02.814
- I'll take her.
- No. No, I got her.

12:02.972 --> 12:05.475
- She's fine.
- She's exhausted. She should get a nap.

12:05.934 --> 12:07.777
Judd, Paul.

12:07.936 --> 12:08.983
Shh.

12:09.145 --> 12:11.648
You need to put a baby
in that woman yesterday.

12:11.814 --> 12:12.815
I'm working on it.

12:12.982 --> 12:15.703
- Have you had your man parts checked yet?
- Come on, not now, Wendy.

12:15.818 --> 12:18.162
Because you may have emptied them
over the years.

12:19.989 --> 12:22.663
My room was next to yours.
My room was next to yours.

12:22.825 --> 12:26.750
Well, this is great. I can tell it's gonna be
a really good experience for all you guys.

12:26.955 --> 12:29.504
So I'm just gonna let you sit here
for a bit.

12:29.666 --> 12:31.346
- Thanks.
- Reconnect. You got it.

12:31.417 --> 12:33.840
I will be back later...
Dude, don't. Stop it.

12:34.337 --> 12:36.590
...To make sure that nobody gets hurt.

12:38.967 --> 12:40.810
Phillip.

12:40.969 --> 12:43.438
Take care.
I'll see you guys soon. Be good.

12:45.014 --> 12:46.516
What's that? What are you writing?

12:46.683 --> 12:48.981
What? Oh, I'm just jotting down
a few thoughts.

12:49.143 --> 12:51.191
- Oh, God help us.
- Relax. It's not about you.

12:51.354 --> 12:53.356
- It's always about us.
- Tell that to my shrink.

12:53.523 --> 12:57.528
- Fine. Satisfied?
- Great. Thank you.

13:03.199 --> 13:04.667
What happens now?

13:05.868 --> 13:10.544
We haven't been together for ages,
so why don't you just take some time...

13:10.707 --> 13:12.550
...you know, to catch up?

13:15.837 --> 13:18.056
<i>And bitches
out there don't faze me.</i>

13:18.214 --> 13:19.636
You gonna get that?

13:19.799 --> 13:23.019
<i>A ho is a ho
A bitch is a bitch is a bitch, so.</i>

13:23.177 --> 13:25.225
Thanks for the music.

13:25.388 --> 13:28.062
Maybe you got a vibrate switch
on that thing. Just an aside.

13:28.558 --> 13:30.231
Hey.

13:30.393 --> 13:32.441
Are phone calls allowed?

13:32.603 --> 13:36.233
What? Oh, no, no, no. No, we're
just sitting in an awkward silence.

13:38.526 --> 13:40.528
She's here.

13:41.863 --> 13:44.707
And by "she" he means...?

13:47.243 --> 13:48.604
What's going on? What's happening?

13:48.745 --> 13:51.145
Who is that? Is that his lawyer?
Is Phillip in trouble again?

13:51.289 --> 13:52.415
When is he not in trouble?

13:54.250 --> 13:56.048
- Okay, that's not his lawyer.
- Oh.

13:56.210 --> 13:59.214
Why not? It would be so like Phillip
to be doing his lawyer.

14:01.758 --> 14:02.930
Let's go.

14:03.092 --> 14:04.935
Go. Go.

14:05.094 --> 14:07.392
- He's coming.
- Everyone.

14:08.014 --> 14:10.893
- This is Tracy.
- Ha, ha.

14:11.059 --> 14:13.061
- Hey, Tracy.
- Hi. Hi. Hi.

14:13.227 --> 14:14.444
- My fiancée.
- What?!

14:14.604 --> 14:16.902
- Oh, boy.
- Engaged to be engaged, actually.

14:17.065 --> 14:18.157
Oh.

14:18.316 --> 14:21.786
I'm so sorry to be meeting you all
under such sad circumstances.

14:22.445 --> 14:24.618
I'm making a poopie.

14:24.781 --> 14:28.706
- Oh. I love doing that.
- Okay. We are on the goal line.

14:28.868 --> 14:30.620
London just keeps moving
the goalposts back.

14:30.787 --> 14:32.187
That's Barry. He's a bit of an ass.

14:32.330 --> 14:34.082
- Phillip.
- It's okay. He can't hear us.

14:34.248 --> 14:36.592
- This is my brother Judd.
- Hi. Pleasure.

14:36.751 --> 14:38.128
- My sister, Wendy.
- Hi.

14:38.294 --> 14:39.591
Oldest brother, Paul.

14:39.754 --> 14:42.132
- His wife, Annie.
- Hi! Tracy!

14:42.298 --> 14:44.972
- Welcome to the family! You're gorgeous!
- Thank you.

14:45.134 --> 14:47.478
Get out while you still can. Heh-heh-heh.

14:47.637 --> 14:50.436
Funny story. Annie used to be
Judd's girlfriend, back in the day.

14:50.598 --> 14:52.020
Phillip, that's enough.

14:52.183 --> 14:54.106
And this, of course, is my mother,
Hilary Altman.

14:54.268 --> 14:56.737
Mrs. Altman.
It is a tremendous honor to meet you.

14:56.896 --> 15:00.150
Your book, Cradle and All,
was a really important book for me.

15:00.316 --> 15:02.910
- Agh.
Heh-heh-heh.

15:03.069 --> 15:05.538
My children are not very proud
of my life's work.

15:05.696 --> 15:06.788
All right. Not now, Mom.

15:06.948 --> 15:09.872
Every kid in Paul's class knew that he
used to jerk off with an oven mitt.

15:10.076 --> 15:11.623
- That never happened.
- It happened.

15:11.786 --> 15:13.663
Every guy I met expected me to put out.

15:13.830 --> 15:16.208
You had a very healthy sexual curiosity.

15:16.374 --> 15:19.674
Which you documented in detail
after reading my diary.

15:19.836 --> 15:22.134
- Secrets are cancer to a family.
- Oy.

15:22.296 --> 15:25.300
Well, Cradle and All was the inspiration
for my dissertation.

15:25.466 --> 15:31.189
So I would like to think that your family's
dysfunction helped me to get my Ph.D. Heh.

15:31.347 --> 15:33.850
- Tracy is also a therapist, Mom.
- I gathered.

15:34.016 --> 15:36.439
- Heh.
- She was my therapist, actually.

15:36.602 --> 15:41.199
Naturally, once we realized we had feelings for
each other, I referred him to a colleague.

15:41.357 --> 15:43.701
- Naturally.
- Look, Daddy, a T.

15:43.860 --> 15:45.780
- That's great, sweetie. Go show Mommy.
- Poopie!

15:45.862 --> 15:48.661
- Jesus Christ! What the hell is wrong with you?
- Don't yell at him!

15:48.823 --> 15:51.872
- Well, he threw shit on me!
- He's 3 years old, you asshole.

15:52.034 --> 15:55.163
- Where are the wipey things?
- "Where are the wipey things?"

15:55.329 --> 15:56.672
Coming out of my ass.

15:56.831 --> 15:59.084
There wasn't a lot of liquid,
so the rug's gonna be fine.

15:59.250 --> 16:01.548
I got a conference call.
What do you want me to do?

16:01.711 --> 16:03.031
I'll get the paper towels.

16:03.129 --> 16:05.928
I hope you're still on this call,
I swear to God.

16:06.382 --> 16:10.387
To clarify, today does count
as one of the seven, right?

16:12.054 --> 16:13.397
Okay.

16:18.519 --> 16:19.987
Hmm.

16:29.071 --> 16:31.620
A bulging disk. Pretty common, actually.

16:31.782 --> 16:32.954
We were married for...

16:33.159 --> 16:34.581
So, Paul, no children yet?

16:34.744 --> 16:37.588
No, no kids. We're working on it.
Someday, maybe.

16:37.747 --> 16:40.045
Phillip, you're all grown up.
What do you do now?

16:40.208 --> 16:42.927
Well, I run an alternative-fuel think tank
in D.C.

16:43.085 --> 16:44.132
Isn't that something?

16:44.295 --> 16:46.263
It's a bulging disk.
It's pretty common, actually.

16:46.422 --> 16:48.766
- Hmm. Hmm.
- Usually in men, though, right?

16:48.925 --> 16:51.895
You do see it mostly in men,
but she's pretty active.

16:52.053 --> 16:53.225
She's real active.

16:53.387 --> 16:56.482
Well, I'm managing a small, small,
very private equity fund.

16:56.641 --> 16:57.893
Mostly small... Hey, Molly.

16:58.059 --> 17:00.482
Mostly small cap, emerging markets.
All that good stuff.

17:00.686 --> 17:03.565
- Paul, you got any kids?
- No, no kids yet. One day, maybe.

17:03.731 --> 17:07.281
We made love on our first date. In his car.
Behind the Texaco station.

17:07.443 --> 17:09.866
Oh, shit. She's telling the Texaco story.

17:10.029 --> 17:11.747
Mort left the air conditioning on.

17:11.906 --> 17:13.749
By the time we were done,
the battery was dead.

17:13.907 --> 17:16.330
We had to call my father to come
and give him a jump start.

17:16.493 --> 17:18.212
Maybe they wanna hear
about his hobbies.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.810
The stuff that's going on
in fossil fuels is just really sexy.

17:20.957 --> 17:24.507
God, the passion, the creativity,
the angles.

17:24.710 --> 17:25.801
- Jesus Christ.
- "Angles"?

17:25.962 --> 17:28.002
- Mort knew his way around a woman's body.
- Mother.

17:28.130 --> 17:30.679
- And the sheer size of him. Circumference.
- Mom.

17:30.841 --> 17:34.141
- I don't mind telling you, the man was hung.
- That should've been the headstone.

17:34.303 --> 17:38.854
Clearly, she lost more than a husband. Hmm?
Anybody need anything from the kitchen?

17:39.475 --> 17:41.978
No, it's true. I mean, I
miss him and I miss it.

17:42.812 --> 17:45.235
- Hi.
- Hi, Judd. I'm just trying to make some space.

17:45.398 --> 17:48.117
Hmm. Well, I'm gonna sneak out for a drive.

17:48.276 --> 17:50.950
I have a feeling Mom
is just getting warmed up in there.

17:51.112 --> 17:52.489
The talking helps.

17:52.655 --> 17:54.202
Jerry died 20 years ago...

17:54.365 --> 17:57.995
...and I still find ways of randomly
working him into conversations.

17:58.160 --> 18:00.162
Like right there, for instance.

18:00.329 --> 18:02.627
How come you never found anyone else?

18:03.291 --> 18:05.965
Boy. That was very rude. I apologize.

18:06.127 --> 18:08.050
It'd be a terrible mistake
to go through life...

18:08.212 --> 18:10.292
...thinking people are the sum total
of what you see.

18:10.423 --> 18:13.518
Linda, I'm an asshole. Just forgive me.

18:13.676 --> 18:16.179
- You get a free pass this week.
- Thank you.

18:16.345 --> 18:21.442
And thank you for taking care of Mom
these past few months.

18:21.601 --> 18:24.696
I'll bet she would've been a
mess without you. Thank you.

18:24.854 --> 18:26.856
Why don't you swing by the store
and pick up Horry?

18:27.023 --> 18:29.784
I don't like him walking home in the dark.
He gets confused sometimes.

18:29.942 --> 18:31.444
Sure.

18:32.778 --> 18:36.032
- Side door. Clean getaway.
- Mm-hm. Heh.

18:55.384 --> 18:57.227
Horry. You need a ride?

18:57.386 --> 18:58.729
Hey, Judd.

19:02.016 --> 19:03.063
Judd Altman.

19:03.225 --> 19:05.398
- Oh, my God.
- Is that Penny?

19:05.561 --> 19:07.689
I'm so sorry about your dad.

19:07.855 --> 19:10.404
I should've come today. I'm sorry.
I have a thing with funerals.

19:10.566 --> 19:14.241
I'm afraid I'll start laughing or bawling or
say something inappropriate, so I don't go.

19:14.403 --> 19:16.246
Which is not a solution,
but there you have it.

19:16.405 --> 19:19.750
- Anyway, what's it been? Seven, 8, 9 years?
- Something like that.

19:19.909 --> 19:21.877
Horry said you came alone.
What happened to Quinn?

19:22.036 --> 19:23.837
- You didn't split up, did you?
Mm-mm.

19:23.913 --> 19:27.353
- Sorry. I don't know why I say these things.
- Just a freak accident on an elliptical.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.594
Goddamn antidepressants I'm on.
You know?

19:29.752 --> 19:32.380
- They just obliterate whatever filter I have.
- Mm-hm.

19:33.422 --> 19:35.095
It's very embarrassing.

19:35.466 --> 19:39.642
- She left me.
- I knew it! I fucking knew it!

19:40.429 --> 19:42.102
- I knew that. I'm sorry, but...
- Aah!

19:42.264 --> 19:43.811
She slept with my boss, so...

19:43.974 --> 19:45.942
- Well, that'll do it.
- Yes, it did.

19:46.102 --> 19:47.228
- Done.
- Right.

19:47.395 --> 19:48.738
Gosh.
And now your father.

19:48.896 --> 19:52.321
I'm sorry, Judd.
You're having a profoundly shitty year.

19:52.483 --> 19:54.406
I've had better. Yeah, it's not...

19:55.152 --> 19:57.325
Anyway, so you live here still?

19:57.488 --> 20:01.584
My mom got very sick, so I came back to
spend time with her and see that through.

20:01.742 --> 20:06.589
And then, I don't know,
I just became the girl that never left.

20:06.747 --> 20:08.920
It's understandable.
It's a pretty place.

20:09.458 --> 20:10.960
Are you still skating?

20:11.127 --> 20:14.848
Yeah, I'm still skating. I'm running the skating
school over at Spencer's now, which is great.

20:15.005 --> 20:17.303
- It's perfect. I get to skate every day.
- Good for you.

20:17.466 --> 20:19.667
The owner gives me run of the place,
which is awesome...

20:19.802 --> 20:21.645
...in exchange for some
small sexual favors.

20:21.804 --> 20:23.977
Hmm. Nice of him. And you.
Great arrangement.

20:24.140 --> 20:26.268
- You used to laugh at my jokes.
- No, I didn't.

20:26.434 --> 20:28.595
- Yes, you did.
- I did. You used to be funnier.

20:31.480 --> 20:35.986
Well, I'm not a fan of small talk,
so I'm gonna give you a hug.

20:36.527 --> 20:39.371
- Mm. Heh.
- Mm.

20:39.530 --> 20:40.827
Yeah, what a surprise.

20:40.990 --> 20:43.493
Thanks, Horry. I'll pick them up tomorrow.

20:48.998 --> 20:50.966
I'll be outside when you're done.

21:01.010 --> 21:03.854
- Horry, you scared the crap out of me.
- I have that effect on people.

21:04.013 --> 21:06.694
- My mother send you to get me?
- Yes, but I was already headed out.

21:06.766 --> 21:10.020
- Come on. Get in the car.
- Shit. I need to get my own place.

21:10.186 --> 21:13.486
- Heh. Why don't you?
- Oh, brain injury.

21:13.647 --> 21:15.820
- There are things I can't do.
- Like what?

21:16.358 --> 21:19.032
Like remember what the
hell it is I can't do.

21:20.196 --> 21:22.665
- I can get my own car door, though. Thanks.
- Heh.

21:22.823 --> 21:24.040
Sorry.

21:25.534 --> 21:26.911
So Penny, huh?

21:27.077 --> 21:30.001
Yeah, I never figured she'd still be here.

21:30.581 --> 21:33.050
Why? Because she doesn't
have a brain injury?

21:33.459 --> 21:37.509
No. No. Horry, sorry.
I didn't mean it like that. It's just...

21:38.172 --> 21:40.766
- Just...
- I'm just fucking with you. Heh, heh.

21:40.925 --> 21:44.850
Asshole.
It's hard to see people from your past...

21:45.012 --> 21:49.313
...when your present is so
cataclysmically screwed up, you know?

21:50.226 --> 21:51.398
Welcome to my world.

21:59.902 --> 22:03.952
Whoops! We've come apart there, Mom.
Can you please close that robe? Cover it.

22:04.114 --> 22:06.913
They're just breasts, Judd.
Same ones you suckled at.

22:07.076 --> 22:10.376
No, Mother. Those are not the same breasts
you nursed us with. Those are different.

22:10.538 --> 22:11.790
You got bionic breasts now.

22:11.997 --> 22:14.591
Your father didn't see it that way.
He liked to put his penis...

22:14.750 --> 22:16.878
Jesus Christ, Mother.

22:17.086 --> 22:18.929
- Thank you.
- I love you, Judd.

22:19.713 --> 22:21.590
- But?
- What do you mean, "but"?

22:21.757 --> 22:23.759
There's always a "but"
when you say "I love you."

22:23.926 --> 22:27.772
I was just gonna say, I don't know
how you all got so repressed.

22:27.930 --> 22:29.932
Hmm. Go figure. Mm. Whew.

22:30.099 --> 22:32.067
- Mom, I got it. I got the rest.
- You sure?

22:32.226 --> 22:33.899
- I appreciate the help.
- Okay.

22:34.061 --> 22:35.779
- I'm upstairs if you need me.
- Okay.

22:35.938 --> 22:39.112
Hopefully you'll be looking
for another sash for that robe, huh?

22:39.275 --> 22:41.619
You gotta double-sash robe, Mom.

23:40.628 --> 23:42.508
You don't know what
you're talking about.

23:42.630 --> 23:45.791
- He left it to all of us.
- We are not having this conversation.

23:45.799 --> 23:48.759
- Paul, I think this is a wonderful idea.
- This is bullshit.

23:48.761 --> 23:50.841
Dad always wanted
his sons to work together.

23:50.930 --> 23:52.387
It's like
Dad's legacy to us.

23:52.412 --> 23:54.354
You don't know
what you're talking about.

23:54.475 --> 23:56.477
What do you mean?
I'm part of this family.

23:56.644 --> 23:58.324
- Would you listen?
- No, you listen.

23:58.354 --> 24:00.322
Dad always intended
for the store to go to me.

24:00.481 --> 24:03.485
That's why he left half of it to me
and the other half to the three of you.

24:03.651 --> 24:06.825
Now, after we settle the will, I'll buy out
your shares at a fair valuation.

24:06.987 --> 24:09.706
I don't wanna sell you my share.
I wanna run the store with you.

24:09.865 --> 24:12.368
How exactly do you think
you can add to the business?

24:12.534 --> 24:13.706
I can help you grow it.

24:13.869 --> 24:17.715
New locations and expanded lines. What?

24:17.873 --> 24:20.968
- The only thing you've ever grown is weed.
- And he was very good at it.

24:21.126 --> 24:24.221
- Mommy, come on!
- I'm just saying, he's very entrepreneurial.

24:24.380 --> 24:26.382
Listen,
Paul, you don't believe in me.

24:26.548 --> 24:29.392
I get that.
I never believed in myself either, really.

24:29.551 --> 24:32.680
But I've changed. And you're the
brains of the outfit. I know that.

24:32.846 --> 24:36.567
But what about marketing and advertising?
What about networking? I'm the people person.

24:36.725 --> 24:39.569
That's who I am. And you are not one.

24:39.728 --> 24:42.527
You're a nice guy, but let's
face it, You're a little scary.

24:42.690 --> 24:44.909
As a matter of fact,
you're scaring me right now.

24:45.067 --> 24:47.320
Your face is red.
Are you breathing? Is he breathing?

24:47.486 --> 24:50.035
Judd! Get in here and back me up!

24:50.197 --> 24:52.746
Yup. Paul, I do think we
should talk about it.

24:52.908 --> 24:54.330
- Thank you.
- Mind your business.

24:54.493 --> 24:56.621
It is his business.
You said he owns a sixth of it.

24:56.787 --> 24:59.256
A third,
because I'm gifting my share to Judd.

24:59.415 --> 25:00.917
- You're welcome.
- Mm. Thank you.

25:01.083 --> 25:04.462
So together, Judd and I own half
the business. That's awesome.

25:04.670 --> 25:07.799
This is my livelihood!
You can't just make this decision.

25:07.965 --> 25:11.166
- Let's talk about this, please.
- We just did. You guys don't have a clue.

25:11.260 --> 25:12.887
He's not coming to work for me.

25:13.053 --> 25:16.102
Well, see, we'd be partners, actually,
after I buy Judd's shares.

25:16.265 --> 25:19.610
- Little brother, you can't even buy a suit.
- People can change, Paul.

25:23.397 --> 25:26.196
Okay. I get it.

25:26.775 --> 25:30.780
- How rich are you exactly, Tracy?
- This has nothing to do with me.

25:30.946 --> 25:33.147
We all know the store is yours.
No one's disputing that.

25:33.282 --> 25:37.082
You little whore.

25:37.244 --> 25:39.087
- Whoa.
- What the fuck did you just call her?

25:39.246 --> 25:41.715
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.
- No, no. Not her. You.

25:41.874 --> 25:43.467
- Ah.
- You're a whore.

25:43.625 --> 25:45.844
- Why don't you come here and say that?
- Here I come.

25:46.003 --> 25:47.050
No, no. Not in the house.

25:49.131 --> 25:51.554
Okay, this was great.

25:51.717 --> 25:55.438
You've given each other a lot to absorb.
Let's agree to put a pin in it, shall we?

25:55.596 --> 25:58.145
And then you can assimilate
the new information.

25:58.307 --> 26:00.810
Maybe reconsider your positions.
Okay? Great.

26:00.976 --> 26:02.944
- Makes sense.
- Great work, guys.

26:03.145 --> 26:04.772
Argh! You motherfucker.

26:06.315 --> 26:07.362
- Come here.
- Get off.

26:07.524 --> 26:10.403
- Not in the house.
- Come on, guys.

26:13.489 --> 26:15.162
- Are you all right?
- Ugh.

26:16.033 --> 26:17.706
Whew.

26:19.995 --> 26:22.669
- Good morning.
- Oh, my God.

26:23.165 --> 26:24.917
What?

26:25.084 --> 26:27.365
- What was that moment?
- Could I talk about it?

26:27.503 --> 26:28.629
About your brother?

26:28.796 --> 26:31.515
So I'm 11 years old,
and Mom's out somewhere...

26:31.673 --> 26:35.018
...and Dad was upstairs, like,
fixing the rain gutters on the roof.

26:35.177 --> 26:38.727
And I am downstairs, babysitting Phillip,
the eternal baby...

26:38.889 --> 26:39.981
...like always...

26:40.140 --> 26:44.941
...when I suddenly realize that I have
gotten my period for the first time.

26:45.104 --> 26:49.075
Anyway, 11, right?
So I run outside and call up to Dad...

26:49.274 --> 26:51.995
...but he's, like, using a power tool
or something and can't hear me.

26:52.152 --> 26:55.201
I grab a baseball off the lawn
and toss it up at him.

26:55.364 --> 26:57.162
I mean, I just meant to get his attention.

26:57.324 --> 27:00.203
But somehow,
it hits him square in the back of the head.

27:00.369 --> 27:02.838
- He falls off the roof.
- Oh, I remember that.

27:02.996 --> 27:06.216
Ha-ha-ha.
- Okay. So we all get in the back seat.

27:06.375 --> 27:10.551
Dad drives to the hospital with a
broken arm and a gash on his forehead.

27:10.712 --> 27:14.387
And the nurse looks at him and she's like,
"What in the world happened to you?"

27:14.550 --> 27:16.973
And Dad just says,
"My daughter got her period."

27:18.345 --> 27:20.313
That is so fantastic, Wendy.

27:22.015 --> 27:24.689
- That's so much like your dad.
- Oh, let me say hi.

27:24.852 --> 27:27.412
- It's your wife. Aren't you gonna take it?
- I'll call her back.

27:27.479 --> 27:29.447
Why don't you tell another story
about your cycle?

27:29.606 --> 27:31.529
- That was a real crowd pleaser.
- Ha, ha!

27:31.692 --> 27:34.992
No, Wendy's gone already. It's your turn.
Give us a good story about you and Dad.

27:35.154 --> 27:37.577
Oh. That's what we're doing, huh?
I'm blanking.

27:37.739 --> 27:38.911
Maybe come back to me.

27:39.074 --> 27:42.078
What, you can't think of a single memory
of your father?

27:43.745 --> 27:47.249
- Not right now. Go ahead.
- No, I already went. Mine was amazing.

27:47.416 --> 27:49.714
I don't know what's going on with you,
but I do know this,

27:49.877 --> 27:54.383
If you don't take the time to properly mourn
your father here, you're gonna regret it.

27:56.717 --> 27:58.765
And shiva time.

28:01.430 --> 28:03.728
- Did you like the book?
- Yeah.

28:03.891 --> 28:05.484
Okay. To you?

28:05.642 --> 28:07.144
That'd be perfect.

28:07.936 --> 28:09.108
Crazy, right?

28:09.271 --> 28:11.273
- I'm so sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

28:13.400 --> 28:14.447
- Hi, Wendy.
- Hi.

28:19.781 --> 28:21.901
- Have some coffee.
- No, thank you. I don't want any.

28:21.992 --> 28:23.960
- You want this coffee.
- It's not even coffee.

28:24.119 --> 28:26.320
- What is that?
- It's Dad's schnapps. I raided the bar.

28:26.455 --> 28:28.628
No, thank you. Get it out of my face.
Are you drunk?

28:28.790 --> 28:30.351
- Don't judge me.
- I'm not judging you.

28:31.627 --> 28:34.471
It's great. You don't really drink
that much, right? Good for you.

28:34.630 --> 28:37.474
- Oh, my God, will you just take the call?
- No. Just butt out. Please?

28:37.633 --> 28:40.637
This is crazy enough
without you keeping your divorce a secret.

28:40.802 --> 28:44.978
- Be quiet, please. Mother's right next to me.
- I am being quiet. That's the funny thing.

28:45.140 --> 28:48.540
- You just got louder. Mother's next to me.
- If you can't tell your family, then who?

28:48.644 --> 28:52.023
- I would rather tell anyone else, actually.
- That is rude.

28:52.189 --> 28:55.159
- Why don't you go upstairs and take a nap?
- I can't do this anymore.

28:55.317 --> 28:58.116
Because this is already a new record
for me keeping my mouth shut.

28:58.278 --> 29:00.280
Hey, drunk girl,
why don't you shut your face?

29:00.447 --> 29:04.168
It is growing inside me like this fat
hairy tumor. I need to let it out.

29:04.326 --> 29:06.806
- Seriously, put that down.
- You're stressed out and grieving.

29:06.912 --> 29:10.587
- You're walking around like a ticking bomb.
- Make the words stop coming out of your mouth.

29:10.749 --> 29:14.549
People ask me, "What's going on with Judd?" I
have to be like, "I don't know." But I do know.

29:14.711 --> 29:17.885
- I can't believe how much I hate you right now.
- Listen, I love you.

29:18.048 --> 29:20.847
- You tell them, or I will tell them.
- Get your hand off me, please.

29:21.009 --> 29:22.352
I will pinch you. I'll punch you.

29:22.511 --> 29:25.014
Judd,
where is that beautiful wife of yours?

29:25.180 --> 29:27.558
She's gone. Quinn is gone. It's over.

29:27.724 --> 29:30.022
It's a little bit complicated.
Or maybe it's not.

29:30.185 --> 29:33.906
She's been sleeping with my boss.
I walked in on them having sex in my bed.

29:34.064 --> 29:36.817
So I guess it's not that complicated.
It's simple.

29:36.984 --> 29:40.033
I'm divorcing her whore ass.

29:42.698 --> 29:44.666
How are you doing, Mrs. Applebaum?

29:46.368 --> 29:47.415
- Happy?
- Yep.

29:47.577 --> 29:48.703
Thank you.

29:54.501 --> 29:56.754
You stop it. Stop it.

29:57.379 --> 29:58.756
Ha, ha. Oh, my God.

29:58.964 --> 30:01.058
You're like a magician.

30:01.508 --> 30:02.725
You okay, there?

30:02.884 --> 30:05.433
Yeah. I realize what
this must look like to you all.

30:05.595 --> 30:07.563
I mean, this was supposed to be a fling,
you know?

30:07.723 --> 30:10.272
Younger guy, get in, get out, move on.

30:11.059 --> 30:14.359
- Appropriate men are so boring, you know?
- I do know.

30:14.563 --> 30:15.735
And disappointing.

30:15.897 --> 30:19.026
And Phillip was alive and in the moment...

30:20.319 --> 30:22.242
...and it wasn't supposed to turn
into anything.

30:24.698 --> 30:28.077
- I mean, really, look at him. He's a moron.
- Yeah.

30:28.243 --> 30:31.543
Of course, I'm the moron
who fell in love with him, so...

30:33.415 --> 30:34.758
Don't worry about Chelsea.

30:34.916 --> 30:37.886
Phillip's skanky ex-girlfriends
are a dime a dozen.

30:38.045 --> 30:40.423
Do they all have to look
like Victoria's Secret models?

30:40.589 --> 30:43.763
- She's not that hot.
- Oh, come on. I would do her.

30:43.925 --> 30:47.520
Yeah. I wouldn't say that
in front of my brother.

30:52.768 --> 30:56.693
There you are. Hey. Want some help?

30:58.440 --> 30:59.942
So sorry about Quinn.

31:00.108 --> 31:03.783
Yeah, yeah. I'm sorry I didn't
tell you any sooner. I just...

31:03.945 --> 31:07.370
It's been a very long time
since we told each other things.

31:07.532 --> 31:09.955
I think we're both out of practice.

31:12.120 --> 31:13.918
I guess so.

31:14.748 --> 31:17.752
I got this. I'll do the rest.
You go to bed.

31:19.294 --> 31:21.968
- I love you, son.
- I love you.

31:27.636 --> 31:28.637
Hello?

31:28.804 --> 31:31.924
<i>We're in Paul's car.
Come on, we 're making a run for it.</i>

31:34.601 --> 31:35.944
<i>Jesus.</i>

31:36.103 --> 31:38.447
Boy, this place has not
changed at all, huh?

31:38.605 --> 31:40.903
Why mess with perfection?

31:42.818 --> 31:44.195
- Hi.
- Hey. Ha, ha.

31:45.320 --> 31:46.697
They let you out, huh?

31:46.863 --> 31:50.163
- Oh, little bit more of a jailbreak, actually.
- I bet.

31:50.325 --> 31:54.330
I'd invite you to come join us, but I think that
that would probably be a huge mistake, so...

31:54.496 --> 31:56.840
- Oh. Well, now I have to come.
- You don't. Really.

31:56.998 --> 31:59.626
Penny. I'm warning you. Okay.
Guys, you remember Penny.

31:59.793 --> 32:02.888
Hey, you guys, I just wanted to say
I was so sorry to hear about Mort.

32:03.171 --> 32:04.844
Penny Moore? Wow.

32:05.006 --> 32:07.008
- You don't still live here.
- I do.

32:07.175 --> 32:08.973
- You do?
- Sometimes you're worse than Mom.

32:09.136 --> 32:11.514
- That was uncalled for.
- You should listen to yourself.

32:11.680 --> 32:13.478
You should look at yourself.
How about that?

32:13.640 --> 32:15.642
Can I get beers for everybody?
Who wants a beer?

32:15.809 --> 32:17.811
- Way ahead of you.
- Did you do this?

32:18.603 --> 32:21.026
- I just wanted a beer, Phillip.
- They were all out.

32:21.189 --> 32:24.659
This is great. All of us together. I don't
know why we don't do this more often.

32:24.818 --> 32:26.240
We don't like each other very much.

32:26.403 --> 32:29.498
I never got a chance to go out drinking
with my brothers. And my sister.

32:29.656 --> 32:31.875
By the time I could drink,
you guys were all gone.

32:32.033 --> 32:34.707
- This is a big moment for me. To my family.
- Cheers.

32:34.870 --> 32:36.713
- And to Dad.
- To Dad.

32:36.872 --> 32:38.340
- To Dad.
- To Dad.

32:38.540 --> 32:42.044
- Just have half of that.
- Yeah. Judd, take care of Judd.

32:42.711 --> 32:43.758
That's awful.

32:43.920 --> 32:46.764
- So this thing with Quinn...?
- Well, we're not gonna discuss that.

32:46.923 --> 32:48.345
- Can we?
- No. We can't.

32:48.508 --> 32:52.058
- We discussed it with the whole neighborhood.
- We did. Thanks to you. Appreciate it.

32:52.220 --> 32:54.598
- The whole neighborhood?
- The whole neighborhood knows.

32:54.764 --> 32:57.267
It was ugly.
Whatever you're imagining, multiply it.

32:57.434 --> 33:00.734
- Come on, you needed to let it out.
- You needed to let it out.

33:00.896 --> 33:03.617
- I did need to let it out.
- We don't have to talk about it anymore.

33:04.941 --> 33:07.160
I can't understand why
she was fucking Wade Beaufart.

33:07.319 --> 33:09.120
- Me neither.
- Walk me through that.

33:09.154 --> 33:11.875
- No, we're at Walker's.
- Please, anything else you wanna discuss...

33:11.948 --> 33:14.576
...I'm happy to.
We just got here like ten minutes ago.

33:14.743 --> 33:17.792
Look, you need to calm down.
Calm down. Calm down.

33:17.954 --> 33:19.547
I'm coming home. I'm coming home.

33:21.708 --> 33:23.426
- I have to go have sex.
- Oh.

33:23.585 --> 33:27.055
- In some cultures, people actually enjoy sex.
- Well, not when it's on a schedule.

33:27.214 --> 33:29.933
Come on, Annie's hot.
Not as hot as when she dated Judd, but...

33:30.091 --> 33:31.934
- Why don't you shut the fuck up?
- Here we go.

33:32.093 --> 33:33.766
- We're not doing this again.
- "Again"?

33:33.929 --> 33:36.369
Judd dated her six months.
I've been married to her six years.

33:36.473 --> 33:38.817
At what point are you gonna stop
being an asshole about it?

33:38.975 --> 33:42.605
I don't know. Maybe at the point
when it stops bugging the shit out of you.

33:42.771 --> 33:44.569
It was actually more like nine months.

33:44.731 --> 33:47.109
- Jesus, Judd.
- You never forget your first.

33:49.986 --> 33:52.455
I've had about enough
of you today, Phillip.

33:54.199 --> 33:55.496
That's fair.

33:58.828 --> 34:01.297
- Okay.
- Penny.

34:01.456 --> 34:02.958
Go take care of business.

34:03.416 --> 34:06.465
- You guys are idiots. Seriously. Off-the-charts.
- What did I do?

34:06.628 --> 34:08.096
- Bye, Penny.
- Bye.

34:08.255 --> 34:10.132
- Aw.
- We'll take a cab. Or walk.

34:10.297 --> 34:11.641
Seven days, huh?

34:11.800 --> 34:14.001
- I don't know how we're gonna make it.
- Ha, ha.

34:14.052 --> 34:17.476
I don't know. You have each other
no matter what, and I think that's great.

34:17.639 --> 34:19.266
I'm an only child, so...

34:19.431 --> 34:21.775
- That sounds so good.
- Ha, ha.

34:21.935 --> 34:23.482
Does that not sound good?

34:23.645 --> 34:24.862
Yeah.

34:33.112 --> 34:34.489
- Oh. Hello.
- Oh, God.

34:34.906 --> 34:36.666
I should've known
you were gonna be out here.

34:36.824 --> 34:39.498
Come out here. I figured something out.

34:40.536 --> 34:43.380
- You're gonna like it. It's about you.
- I'd better like it.

34:44.958 --> 34:47.335
I should just come out here
and push you off the roof.

34:48.837 --> 34:50.339
Come here, Grandpa.

34:50.505 --> 34:53.349
- Used to be a lot easier.
- Heh.

34:54.342 --> 34:56.686
No, thank you. You're done too.

34:56.844 --> 34:59.894
- It's gonna be Penny Moore. It's fantastic.
- What are you talking about?

35:00.056 --> 35:03.060
The person that you sleep with
before you get back together with Quinn.

35:03.268 --> 35:06.147
Is that what you've got figured out?
I'm not sleeping with Penny.

35:06.313 --> 35:10.739
I mean, it's kind of poetic, actually, if you
think about how crazy she was about you.

35:10.900 --> 35:12.868
She was a kid. It was a long time ago.

35:13.028 --> 35:16.373
Penny was in love with you.
But you were in love with Annie.

35:16.531 --> 35:19.705
Until you met Quinn.
Then you married Quinn, and she left you.

35:19.868 --> 35:23.247
And Annie married Paul.
And that is the glory of love.

35:23.413 --> 35:26.883
We want the ones we can't have,
and we crap all over the ones that we can.

35:27.042 --> 35:29.010
Rinse and repeat.

35:30.086 --> 35:33.681
- Well, you loved Horry.
- And he loved me.

35:34.299 --> 35:39.556
So, of course, life had to take
a steaming dump all over that one.

35:43.433 --> 35:46.232
And what makes you think that I'm
gonna get back together with Quinn?

35:47.437 --> 35:50.566
Divorce is complicated.
Starting over is complicated.

35:51.066 --> 35:53.410
And you don't do complicated, Judd.
You never have.

35:53.568 --> 35:55.070
Bullshit. What are you talking about?

35:55.236 --> 35:59.241
You have had your whole life mapped out
since you were 12 years old.

35:59.407 --> 36:02.251
With your pretty wife
and your perfect apartment.

36:02.410 --> 36:04.788
That's just who you are, you know?
No muss, no fuss.

36:04.954 --> 36:07.924
And so you're gonna sleep with Penny
so you can forgive Quinn...

36:08.083 --> 36:12.429
...and then you'll get back on the road more
traveled and pretend you never got off.

36:15.840 --> 36:18.093
Glad you got it all thought out.

36:18.259 --> 36:20.136
It's what I do.

37:26.494 --> 37:29.964
No, no,
come on. Seriously?

37:30.999 --> 37:32.171
Hello?

37:38.047 --> 37:40.846
Hey. Sorry, I was blow-drying my hair.
I think I blew a fuse.

37:41.009 --> 37:44.138
No, it's not your fault.
My dad insisted on doing his own wiring.

37:44.304 --> 37:48.354
He actually would have preferred to have been
electrocuted than pay a licensed professional.

37:49.142 --> 37:50.689
Oh, Jesus Christ!

37:50.852 --> 37:52.854
- Are you okay? Ha-ha-ha.
- Not that one.

37:53.021 --> 37:55.149
How about this one?

37:55.482 --> 37:56.699
Ah, yes.

37:56.858 --> 37:59.862
- All right. Got it in two.
- Runs in the family.

38:00.028 --> 38:01.826
Back to your day.

38:01.988 --> 38:03.456
Nicely done.

38:04.866 --> 38:06.960
So crazy we're all back
in this house again, huh?

38:07.535 --> 38:09.537
- Wow.
- What do you got there?

38:09.704 --> 38:10.705
Oh, this is, um, my...

38:10.872 --> 38:13.842
- Something you wanna tell me?
- Yes, I'm a drug addict. Ha, ha.

38:14.000 --> 38:16.173
Poor Annie. That's for the babies?

38:16.336 --> 38:18.885
It's my fertility medicine. So that's fun.

38:19.214 --> 38:21.933
- Sorry you're going through that.
- Oh, it's awesome.

38:22.091 --> 38:25.846
- Mm-hm.
- So not tense in any way for a marriage.

38:26.012 --> 38:29.391
- Mm. Good luck.
- Yeah. Here's hoping.

38:39.400 --> 38:41.744
Boom, boom, boom.

38:41.903 --> 38:44.122
I cracked them up.

38:44.280 --> 38:46.360
- Come on.
- Don't give me this shit.

38:46.407 --> 38:49.911
You were sitting there flirting with
her in front of me, in front of your family.

38:50.078 --> 38:52.251
It's two friends having a conversation.

38:52.413 --> 38:53.915
So that's your correct answer?

38:54.082 --> 38:56.084
Well, apparently
I'm an irredeemable asshole.

38:56.251 --> 39:00.552
Phillip, please tell me and my deaf children,
how did you manage to seduce your therapist?

39:00.713 --> 39:03.011
- Why are you doing this, Phillip?
- Doing what, Mommy?

39:03.174 --> 39:05.643
- Dating your mother.
- Fuck off, Wendy.

39:05.802 --> 39:07.054
- Rude.
- Sorry.

39:07.220 --> 39:10.019
- Well, I think Tracy is lovely.
- Thank you.

39:10.181 --> 39:11.774
She's closer to my age than yours.

39:11.933 --> 39:14.277
I'm not as young as you like to think,
and neither are you.

39:14.435 --> 39:15.687
- Hey.
- Hey.

39:15.854 --> 39:18.949
There is no version of this scenario
that doesn't end badly.

39:19.107 --> 39:21.530
- Kind of like this conversation?
- Which ends right now.

39:21.693 --> 39:23.974
- Right behind you.
- You cannot leave this house.

39:24.070 --> 39:25.242
We're sitting shiva.

39:25.405 --> 39:28.705
Mom, you're sitting in the same spot
we put our Christmas tree.

39:30.243 --> 39:31.540
Oh, it's a fast car.

39:31.703 --> 39:33.823
- I know what you're thinking.
- That we're gonna die?

39:33.955 --> 39:36.716
That I'm a screw-up and that Tracy's rich
and that's why I'm with her.

39:37.250 --> 39:38.718
Shit. Phillip.

39:41.754 --> 39:43.597
Why are you with her?

39:43.756 --> 39:44.973
You know, because I love her.

39:45.133 --> 39:47.306
A better class of woman
is helping me grow a little.

39:47.510 --> 39:48.807
You're using her for her class?

39:49.012 --> 39:51.140
I'm not using her
any more than she's using me.

39:51.306 --> 39:54.310
But isn't that what love is? Two people
who fulfill needs within each other?

39:54.475 --> 39:56.819
Slow down. Please. Phillip. Come on, man.

39:57.020 --> 40:00.274
Hey. Hey. Slow down. Way too fast.
This is not a toy.

40:00.440 --> 40:02.067
- You wanna drive?
- Yeah, I wanna drive.

40:02.233 --> 40:04.986
Pull over. Brake.

40:05.153 --> 40:06.905
That's sensible. Thank you.

40:07.071 --> 40:09.790
- Fucking bullshit.
- See you in an hour.

40:09.949 --> 40:12.327
Hey, hey, hey!

40:12.994 --> 40:16.214
- Phillip!
- Tell Penny I said hi!

Grab some skates from
the rental shack.

40:47.487 --> 40:50.286
No, no, I wasn't planning
on skating today.

40:50.448 --> 40:52.826
I wasn't planning on doing that routine
in front of you...

40:52.992 --> 40:55.370
...so I guess the day has other plans
for both of us.

40:55.536 --> 40:57.334
- Don't throw that.
- Go with it.

40:57.497 --> 40:58.669
I'm just gonna wa...

40:58.831 --> 41:01.675
Well, I can't reach that. I'll watch.

41:01.876 --> 41:02.877
Come on.

41:03.670 --> 41:05.172
All right.

41:14.597 --> 41:19.194
All right. Stay in the car, Phillip.
Stay in the car.

41:24.983 --> 41:26.576
Wow.

41:26.734 --> 41:28.407
Nice.

41:29.654 --> 41:32.203
- Little mood lighting, huh?
- What are you waiting for?

41:32.365 --> 41:36.245
- You can skate, can't you?
- Of course I can skate. Yeah.

41:36.411 --> 41:38.163
- Oh, no, no. Oh.
- Aah!

41:38.329 --> 41:39.421
Oh, that hurts.

41:39.580 --> 41:42.254
- Are you okay?
- Oh. I forgot how much fun this is.

41:42.417 --> 41:44.920
- Oh.
- Oh, God. Oh, dear.

41:46.379 --> 41:47.722
- Welcome.
- Ha, ha.

41:47.880 --> 41:49.598
You really are a mess, aren't you?

41:49.757 --> 41:51.555
- Yeah, I am.
- Ha-ha-ha.

41:51.718 --> 41:54.437
You're not catching me at my best.

41:57.265 --> 41:58.357
Do you miss him?

42:00.018 --> 42:01.361
Do I miss my dad?

42:01.769 --> 42:04.522
- Yeah.
- Yeah. Yeah, I miss my dad.

42:05.857 --> 42:10.613
And he did happen to die at a time
when life is kind of messy.

42:10.778 --> 42:13.952
I mean, I don't know if I would've
talked to him about any of it...

42:14.157 --> 42:17.752
...but there's something nice about knowing
that he was out there, you know?

42:20.121 --> 42:22.044
Yeah.

42:24.459 --> 42:25.836
Ah.

42:27.795 --> 42:30.969
Have you ever been up to Maine, Penny?

42:31.132 --> 42:33.305
Ha, ha. What?

42:33.509 --> 42:36.638
Heh. Sorry, just go with it.
You ever been up there?

42:37.513 --> 42:39.186
Um...

42:39.348 --> 42:42.443
- I've been to Cape Cod. Does that count?
- It does, yeah.

42:43.352 --> 42:47.448
For as long as I can remember,
every time I drive on the interstate...

42:47.607 --> 42:48.984
...I would always think,

42:49.150 --> 42:51.619
If I just keep heading north,
I can get to Maine, right?

42:51.778 --> 42:53.906
Honestly, it doesn't need to be Maine
specifically...

42:54.072 --> 42:55.870
...I suppose, but just
any place new, right?

42:56.032 --> 42:59.662
And I never have.
I've never taken any chances.

43:01.746 --> 43:04.875
I've spent my entire
life playing it safe...

43:05.041 --> 43:09.137
...just to avoid being exactly
where I am right now.

43:09.796 --> 43:13.096
Well, you know where you are right now?

43:13.257 --> 43:16.056
Right now you're in a cool rink
on a hot day...

43:16.260 --> 43:18.388
...listening to a Cyndi Lauper classic...

43:18.554 --> 43:20.477
...under some disco lights.

43:21.057 --> 43:25.403
Cut yourself some slack, Judd.
Anything can happen.

43:25.561 --> 43:27.734
Anything happens all the time.

You're a dick.

43:50.044 --> 43:51.967
Yeah, tell me something
I don't know.

43:52.630 --> 43:55.053
Your shirt's on inside out.

43:57.176 --> 43:59.520
That, I did not know.

44:10.231 --> 44:11.983
Hi.

44:12.400 --> 44:15.529
I'm so sorry to show up unannounced like
this, but I've been trying to call.

44:15.736 --> 44:18.455
- I wish you would've told me.
- What do you want?

44:19.782 --> 44:21.659
Smells like dead fish in here.

44:21.826 --> 44:23.920
Don't worry about that.
You're gonna be leaving soon.

44:24.078 --> 44:27.378
Please, Judd. Do you think it was easy
for me to come here? I need to talk to you.

44:27.540 --> 44:29.133
What do you possibly
have to say here?

44:29.292 --> 44:31.590
Are you and Wade getting married?
Is that it?

44:48.311 --> 44:49.563
Are you sick or something?

44:51.147 --> 44:53.366
I'm something, all right.

44:55.651 --> 44:57.369
You can't possibly
know that it's mine.

44:57.862 --> 45:00.240
It's yours. Trust me.

45:00.823 --> 45:04.748
Well, strangely, trust is not the first
impulse I have when it comes to you.

45:04.911 --> 45:07.164
So it turned out Wade is sterile.

45:09.832 --> 45:11.300
I thought you might like that.

45:11.459 --> 45:12.961
- Sterile.
- Mm-hm.

45:13.127 --> 45:15.471
Hmm.
Couldn't have been too happy about this.

45:15.630 --> 45:18.850
- It was a blow, but he's being supportive.
- What a guy.

45:19.050 --> 45:20.472
Judd.

45:21.302 --> 45:23.600
We were never the same
after we lost our baby.

45:23.763 --> 45:24.980
Hang on.

45:25.139 --> 45:28.609
You're not gonna use our miscarriage as an
excuse for fucking my boss, are you?

45:28.768 --> 45:30.816
No. That's not what I'm saying.

45:30.978 --> 45:32.980
That sounds like what you're loading up.

45:33.147 --> 45:38.028
I'm saying that we were never the same after
that. You just shut down, like always.

45:38.444 --> 45:42.574
Look, I know that it's not how we imagined
it, but we can do this, can't we?

45:42.740 --> 45:45.664
I mean, lots of divorced people
raise their children together.

45:46.661 --> 45:47.913
I know it's complicated.

45:48.079 --> 45:50.548
Hmm. And I don't do complicated.

45:50.706 --> 45:52.549
What?

45:52.708 --> 45:54.005
Nothing.

45:54.168 --> 45:57.092
This is happening, Judd.
You're going to be a father.

45:59.340 --> 46:04.096
Ah. I don't know. I guess I was expecting
your reaction to be a bit more...

46:04.845 --> 46:06.347
- I don't know.
- A bit more what?

46:06.514 --> 46:10.018
Last time I saw you,
you were in our bed with my boss.

46:10.184 --> 46:14.030
Tough image to process. Still working on
that. And then you drop this bomb on me?

46:14.188 --> 46:16.611
You might have to give me a minute
on this one. Okay?

46:16.774 --> 46:17.946
You're right.

46:20.027 --> 46:22.780
I checked into the Marriott for a few days.
So, um...

46:24.031 --> 46:25.999
Please come talk to me
when you're ready, okay?

46:28.786 --> 46:30.538
Hi, Phillip.

46:31.038 --> 46:32.711
Quinn.

46:32.873 --> 46:35.626
I always knew there was something
of a cold-hearted slut in you.

46:35.793 --> 46:38.421
- Takes one to know one.
- Touché, pussycat.

46:39.380 --> 46:41.724
So? What are you guys talking about?

46:41.882 --> 46:43.759
- Nothing.
- I'm pregnant.

46:45.720 --> 46:47.063
<i>Mazel tov?</i>

47:00.067 --> 47:04.447
This is one of those tricky situations where you
need someone to talk to or wanna be left alone.

47:05.114 --> 47:07.458
It'd be a great help
if maybe you can let me know...

47:07.616 --> 47:09.744
- Go away, please.
- Okay.

47:10.578 --> 47:13.047
Um... I'll be on the other side.

47:51.994 --> 47:53.211
Wow.

47:54.121 --> 47:56.874
Judd Altman on my front steps.

47:57.291 --> 47:58.668
Have a rough day?

47:59.585 --> 48:02.054
Yup. You could say that.

48:02.630 --> 48:04.132
You wanna talk about it?

48:05.174 --> 48:06.801
No. That okay?

48:06.967 --> 48:08.810
It's okay.

48:09.845 --> 48:13.816
Yeah. I don't know why
I'm here, but, um...

48:13.974 --> 48:18.195
...I could not think of one place
I would rather be more.

48:25.653 --> 48:27.155
You coming in?

48:29.990 --> 48:31.583
Should I?

48:32.493 --> 48:34.291
I would.

48:47.258 --> 48:50.182
Laundry room.
Laundry. Keep going.

48:59.228 --> 49:00.775
Hi.

49:03.858 --> 49:05.360
Horry.

49:06.026 --> 49:07.778
Hey, Sunflower.

49:08.195 --> 49:09.538
What are you doing?

49:10.406 --> 49:12.079
I don't know.

49:12.241 --> 49:13.458
You don't know?

49:13.868 --> 49:16.041
I went to the garage to get this wrench.

49:16.203 --> 49:19.673
Least I think it was the wrench I
was after. But now I'm up here...

49:20.875 --> 49:23.003
...and I can't remember why.

49:23.169 --> 49:24.921
Well, I'm sure it'll come to you.

49:26.881 --> 49:29.009
No, it won't.

49:30.050 --> 49:32.974
Please. Come on. Sit. It's okay.

49:36.474 --> 49:37.896
Horry.

49:39.560 --> 49:40.903
Do you hate me?

49:41.896 --> 49:44.900
- No.
- Not ever?

49:45.566 --> 49:47.284
Not ever.

49:49.403 --> 49:51.076
Because I would.

49:51.739 --> 49:53.286
I should never have left.

49:53.741 --> 49:56.665
I never would've let you stay.
You were 20 years old.

49:56.827 --> 49:58.704
I wasn't gonna be the guy
who kept you here.

49:59.580 --> 50:00.832
After I had the accident...

50:00.998 --> 50:05.094
After we had the accident.
I was in the car with you.

50:05.252 --> 50:06.674
Right?

50:07.254 --> 50:08.801
I know.

50:09.465 --> 50:11.593
I was different afterwards.

50:11.759 --> 50:14.103
I had this anger. I couldn't control it.

50:14.261 --> 50:17.356
- That night in the kitchen...
- You weren't yourself.

50:18.474 --> 50:20.317
I'm still not.

50:48.128 --> 50:49.971
Don't be freaked out.

50:52.633 --> 50:54.055
I'm not.

50:55.761 --> 50:58.810
You're definitely freaking out.

50:58.973 --> 51:01.442
How do you know?
You can't even see me.

51:02.142 --> 51:05.362
Oh, I see you, Judd Altman.

51:06.897 --> 51:09.241
I've always seen you.

51:15.698 --> 51:19.248
<i>So did I hear Serena at
like 3 in the morning last night?</i>

51:19.410 --> 51:21.003
She was up three times.

51:21.161 --> 51:23.004
- Morning.
- Good morning.

51:23.163 --> 51:25.006
Where's your suit?

51:25.165 --> 51:26.212
Why do I need a suit?

51:26.375 --> 51:29.174
Apparently we're going to temple.
Boner sold Mom on it.

51:29.336 --> 51:32.510
- We have to say a prayer for Dad's soul.
- Can't do that here, huh?

51:32.673 --> 51:35.051
Trust me,
I've already asked all the right questions.

51:35.593 --> 51:37.812
Oh. Judd, there you are.

51:37.970 --> 51:40.098
You didn't tell anyone
where you were going yesterday.

51:40.306 --> 51:42.684
- Good reason for that. I didn't want to.
- Oh, Judd.

51:42.850 --> 51:45.524
Everyone, just cut Judd some slack.
He's got a lot on his plate.

51:45.686 --> 51:47.108
- Careful.
- Why? What's going on?

51:47.313 --> 51:50.863
- You know, Quinn's pregnant. It's Judd's.
- No... Goddamn it.

51:51.025 --> 51:52.322
- Holy shit.
- What?

51:52.484 --> 51:55.784
- You ever think before you speak?
- No, that would take all the fun out of it.

51:55.946 --> 51:57.948
This week keeps on getting
better and better.

52:06.915 --> 52:08.212
Unbelievable.

52:11.795 --> 52:12.887
Annie.

52:13.464 --> 52:16.559
- Nice.
- You coming?

52:17.051 --> 52:19.395
No, I think I'm gonna stay back.

52:19.553 --> 52:23.399
- Mm. You sure?
- I think Annie could use somebody to talk to.

52:23.557 --> 52:25.935
You know,
sometimes I think you're too good for me.

52:26.101 --> 52:28.729
Hmm. Don't be silly.

52:28.896 --> 52:31.240
I'm definitely too good for you.

52:43.619 --> 52:46.964
Yeah, I would've hung it up
if I thought I needed it again, Mom. Sorry.

52:47.122 --> 52:49.796
- This was your father's favorite.
- Mm.

52:49.958 --> 52:51.801
It's very nice.

52:51.960 --> 52:55.806
- So. A baby.
- Mm-hm.

52:55.964 --> 52:59.093
- You must be terrified.
- I am.

52:59.760 --> 53:02.855
Well, if it's any consolation,
that feeling never goes away.

53:03.013 --> 53:05.266
- Not really.
- Great.

53:06.266 --> 53:07.358
- Handsome?
- Yeah.

53:07.518 --> 53:09.111
Thank you.

53:09.269 --> 53:11.271
He was very proud of you, you know.

53:13.399 --> 53:16.278
- I wonder what he'd think now.
- What do you mean?

53:16.694 --> 53:20.119
Come on. My marriage is over.
I don't have a job.

53:20.614 --> 53:24.494
That's why you didn't come see him these last
few weeks. You thought he'd think less of you.

53:24.660 --> 53:27.334
I think less of me. I've got nothing.
Look at me.

53:27.496 --> 53:29.624
I'm way too old to have
this much nothing.

53:30.040 --> 53:32.509
- Sit down, baby.
- It's fine. Seriously.

53:32.668 --> 53:35.046
No, let me tell you
about your dad.

53:35.504 --> 53:38.724
You could've talked to him.
He'd have understood.

53:38.924 --> 53:41.894
How? He never failed at anything.
That was kind of Dad's thing, wasn't it?

53:42.052 --> 53:43.304
Oh, God, Judd.

53:43.470 --> 53:47.691
Mort would've lost his business years ago
if it hadn't been for my royalties...

53:47.850 --> 53:49.773
...and Paul coming
in when he did.

53:49.935 --> 53:53.485
- Hmm.
- Your father was a terrible businessman.

53:53.647 --> 53:56.821
He just figured if he had the store,
you'd all come work there.

53:56.984 --> 53:58.577
He just wanted to be around you.

53:58.736 --> 54:01.706
Your father loved you,
not what you did.

54:01.864 --> 54:03.992
I mean, <i>The Man Up Show?</i>
Are you kidding?

54:04.158 --> 54:06.832
You've listened to it, right?
It's asinine. Heh.

54:06.994 --> 54:10.043
No. You were his boy.

54:11.498 --> 54:17.426
And as far as he was concerned, the sun
rose and set on you and your siblings.

54:18.213 --> 54:19.465
Judd.

54:23.051 --> 54:24.598
You're gonna be okay.

54:24.762 --> 54:27.356
- I know.
- No, you don't.

54:27.514 --> 54:28.515
But I do.

54:32.394 --> 54:33.987
How are you so okay?

54:35.105 --> 54:36.948
I think with every passing day...

54:37.107 --> 54:41.283
...I remember your father less
as a sick, frail patient...

54:41.487 --> 54:46.334
...and more as that strong, vibrant man
I was married to all those years.

54:46.617 --> 54:49.621
Also, I'm popping
Xanax like Tic Tacs.

54:50.621 --> 54:52.043
Go on.

54:53.665 --> 54:55.713
<i>Shabbas. Shabbas.</i>

54:55.876 --> 54:56.923
<i>Shabbas.</i>

54:57.085 --> 54:58.553
Good Shabbas, Elmsbrook.

54:58.712 --> 54:59.838
Good Shabbas.

55:00.005 --> 55:02.554
What is that?
I mean, I feel like this is my shul, right?

55:02.716 --> 55:05.390
You feel like my congregation.
You don't sound like them, though.

55:05.552 --> 55:07.554
How about this?
Can I get a <i>Shabbat Shalom?</i>

55:07.721 --> 55:09.098
<i>Shabbat Shalom.</i>

55:09.264 --> 55:11.266
That's what I'm talking about. What?

55:11.433 --> 55:13.561
That's where we should start.
You understand?

55:13.727 --> 55:14.979
We gotta leaven that bread.

55:15.145 --> 55:18.570
But let's take it down for a second.
A couple notches. Let's take it down.

55:18.732 --> 55:21.736
Now, as many of you know,
Mort Altman passed away this past week.

55:22.569 --> 55:27.917
His family's joined us here today to mark
his passing before God and community.

55:28.075 --> 55:29.247
Wendy, how are you?

55:29.409 --> 55:30.535
- You look good.
- Ew.

55:32.579 --> 55:34.673
On a personal note,
I grew up in the Altman home.

55:34.832 --> 55:37.631
- Oh, shit.
- Hanging out with Phillip. Remember?

55:37.793 --> 55:39.795
- Playing ball with the boys.
- Getting wasted.

55:39.962 --> 55:42.010
- Jerking off.
- Trying to touch my boobs.

55:42.172 --> 55:44.766
And I mourn with them. I do.

55:48.136 --> 55:51.481
What do you say we get this party started?
Does now feel like the right time?

55:51.640 --> 55:54.769
It feels like the right time to me.
Cantor Mia. Bring them back up.

55:54.935 --> 55:55.936
See you in a bit.

56:18.125 --> 56:19.297
Wait. Hey.

56:22.838 --> 56:25.307
- Where's he going?
- I don't know. Maybe he's sick.

56:25.465 --> 56:27.217
I'll go check on him.
I'll be right back.

56:35.726 --> 56:38.730
- Here.
- You've been holding out on me.

56:38.896 --> 56:40.489
- What? This?
- Where'd you get this?

56:40.647 --> 56:43.366
This is Dad's jacket, so...

56:43.525 --> 56:46.654
- Dad was a stoner?
- No, it was probably medicinal.

56:46.820 --> 56:48.197
It always is.

56:49.656 --> 56:51.374
Damn. I miss him.

56:51.742 --> 56:55.167
- Yeah.
- I miss you, Dad.

56:56.747 --> 56:58.624
I missed him when he was alive.

57:00.125 --> 57:02.423
Remember how he used to do that thing
with his forehead?

57:02.586 --> 57:03.963
Hmm?

57:04.546 --> 57:06.173
The forehead thing.

57:06.673 --> 57:08.914
- What you talking about?
- It was instead of kissing us.

57:09.259 --> 57:11.102
You do remember how
he never kissed us.

57:11.261 --> 57:14.014
Closest he could get was like,
he would, um...

57:14.181 --> 57:15.933
...press his forehead against yours.

57:16.099 --> 57:17.646
- I know.
- Like this.

57:17.809 --> 57:19.777
Let's do it.

57:23.065 --> 57:26.365
- Yeah, intimacy was not his thing.
- This is intimate.

57:26.526 --> 57:28.403
Get away from me.
You got one eye.

57:28.570 --> 57:30.243
- Ha-ha-ha.
- And I can't handle that.

57:30.405 --> 57:33.534
- You're fucked up.
- That's true, but...

57:34.451 --> 57:37.876
You know the other day
when we were doing the memories of him?

57:38.038 --> 57:42.714
I couldn't come up with one single memory.
Why do you think that is?

57:43.794 --> 57:47.389
I don't know.
And now you're gonna be a dad.

57:48.548 --> 57:51.722
- Just like Dad.
- Poor kid.

57:52.928 --> 57:55.898
I know you're going through a lot
of complex shit right now...

57:56.056 --> 57:58.855
...and granted, this is coming
from the family screw-up...

57:59.226 --> 58:01.399
...but I just want you to know
I'm on your side.

58:01.561 --> 58:03.438
You know, whatever that means...

58:04.773 --> 58:06.741
...I'm on it.

58:08.986 --> 58:10.238
Thanks, Phillip.

58:11.405 --> 58:13.123
Guys, what the hell?

58:14.533 --> 58:15.955
Um...

58:16.576 --> 58:19.500
- Cannabis?
- You're late for class. Please.

58:21.081 --> 58:23.630

58:52.863 --> 58:56.618
Oh, man. I used to
be so much fun.

58:56.825 --> 58:58.293
I don't know what happened.

58:58.452 --> 59:00.295
I'll tell you what happened.
I stayed.

59:00.454 --> 59:03.549
Man, you guys, you went off.
You had your little adventures.

59:03.749 --> 59:05.296
And I held down
the fucking fort.

59:05.459 --> 59:07.962
Because somebody had to,
and now I'm not fun anymore.

59:08.128 --> 59:11.132
- Do you wanna tell him, or should I?
- No, I got this.

59:11.298 --> 59:12.720
You were never any fun.

59:12.883 --> 59:16.012
- Really?
- Paul, I love you to death, but you sucked.

59:16.178 --> 59:17.646
Mm-hm.

59:17.804 --> 59:19.647
I was constant, at least.

59:19.806 --> 59:22.309
- Constant dick.
- Thank you.

59:31.318 --> 59:35.744
Oh, shit. We should get going.
Mom sent me to get you guys a while ago.

59:35.906 --> 59:37.408
We're in temple, for chrissake.

59:37.574 --> 59:40.373
How much trouble does she think
we're gonna get into in temple?

59:43.497 --> 59:45.670
That is the fire alarm.
That is the real fire alarm.

59:45.832 --> 59:48.432
So as a community, let's all get
up and make our way to the exits.

59:48.585 --> 59:49.837
Right by the reader.
Let's go.

59:56.426 --> 59:59.600
This probably isn't gonna
go over very well.

01:00:06.812 --> 01:00:10.032
Everything is fine.
I'm sure it was a false alarm.

01:00:10.190 --> 01:00:12.693
- Just blend in.
- Where would they have gone?

01:00:12.859 --> 01:00:15.578
Ah... Oh, my God.

01:00:16.571 --> 01:00:18.869
- We got it.
- What did you do?

01:00:19.032 --> 01:00:20.249
No. Nobody did anything.

01:00:20.408 --> 01:00:22.536
We put it out.
Hose got away from us, though.

01:00:22.702 --> 01:00:26.047
- You guys smell like a dorm room.
- You got high in temple?

01:00:26.206 --> 01:00:27.833
No, no, no, please, Mother.

01:00:27.999 --> 01:00:29.626
- We knocked out a fire.
- Who's hungry?

01:00:29.835 --> 01:00:31.555
- We got it.
- What the hell, Phillip?

01:00:31.586 --> 01:00:33.054
Phillip had nothing to do with it.

01:00:33.213 --> 01:00:36.387
- It was probably electrical.
- It wasn't electrical. Is that weed I smell?

01:00:36.550 --> 01:00:37.642
Was everybody smoking weed?

01:00:37.843 --> 01:00:39.686
You smell the fire.
Mom smelled the same thing.

01:00:39.845 --> 01:00:40.971
Yeah, I did. I smelled it.

01:00:41.138 --> 01:00:43.498
It's not fire. It's weed.
You guys were smoking weed, right?

01:00:43.640 --> 01:00:45.392
- You'd know.
- Heh.

01:00:45.559 --> 01:00:48.563
You know what? How about you just head out
before the cops come, okay?

01:00:48.728 --> 01:00:50.981
- Smart. See you back home?
- Thanks, Boner.

01:00:51.148 --> 01:00:53.148
- You rock.
- I swear to God. Don't touch my balls.

01:00:53.233 --> 01:00:54.655
And secondly, stop calling me that.

01:00:54.860 --> 01:00:57.409
That was the very last time
you'll ever call me "Boner."

01:00:57.571 --> 01:01:00.245
- Boner, God's watching.
- Oh, my God.

01:01:00.407 --> 01:01:03.081
- Your bones are, like, hollow.
- Get off of me.

01:01:03.243 --> 01:01:06.372
- You're so easy to manipulate.
- You're so strong.

01:01:06.997 --> 01:01:09.250
- I'm sorry, Boner.
- Come on.

01:01:09.416 --> 01:01:12.590
Oh, my God, you guys
are so going to hell.

01:01:12.752 --> 01:01:14.095
Do we believe in hell?

01:01:19.176 --> 01:01:20.928
Wakey, wakey, sleepyhead.

01:01:21.094 --> 01:01:24.519
I was just taking a nap, Mom.
What's everyone doing?

01:01:25.307 --> 01:01:26.934
Hi.

01:01:27.100 --> 01:01:29.148
I'm not your mom.

01:01:30.604 --> 01:01:32.277
Annie, what's going on?

01:01:32.439 --> 01:01:35.989
I feel so bad about how I reacted
when I found out that Quinn was pregnant.

01:01:36.151 --> 01:01:39.155
A simple apology will do.
Get your clothes back on. Put those away.

01:01:39.321 --> 01:01:42.120
- I have been trying to have a baby for years.
- Don't go crazy on me.

01:01:42.282 --> 01:01:45.331
I take my hormones every day.
My eggs have tested fine.

01:01:45.493 --> 01:01:48.292
- I don't like where this is going.
- Paul won't get his sperm tested.

01:01:48.455 --> 01:01:50.815
- No, don't start digging around in...
- Be my friend.

01:01:50.916 --> 01:01:52.996
- What are you doing, Annie?
- It will be our secret.

01:01:53.084 --> 01:01:57.055
- We'll never know if it was you or Paul.
- You just crossed the line there.

01:01:57.214 --> 01:01:59.308
You've lost your mind.
You've lost your judgment.

01:01:59.466 --> 01:02:01.184
- I'm tired, Judd.
- Okay.

01:02:01.343 --> 01:02:03.095
I'm tired of needles.
And ultrasounds.

01:02:03.261 --> 01:02:05.730
- I'll bet.
- And having my heart broken every month.

01:02:05.889 --> 01:02:07.061
- Uncle Judd!
- Shit.

01:02:07.224 --> 01:02:08.771
- Off, off, off. Goddamn it.
- Shit.

01:02:08.934 --> 01:02:11.153
Give me the b... Hi.

01:02:11.311 --> 01:02:13.689
I'm making a pishy and a poopie.

01:02:14.147 --> 01:02:18.243
Okay. Good. Good.
And we were just, uh, getting warm.

01:02:18.443 --> 01:02:21.322
Aunt Annie was super cold
and now she's all set.

01:02:21.488 --> 01:02:23.582
And Uncle Judd's gonna
go get a snackie.

01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:24.992
Judd, I'm...

01:02:25.158 --> 01:02:29.584
I don't know how else to explain this to you. If
the deal falls apart, it's my ass on the line.

01:02:29.746 --> 01:02:32.226
- You had a death in the family.
- Four days ago.

01:02:32.249 --> 01:02:35.924
I have to go to London and close the deal.
Why are we even having this fight?

01:02:36.086 --> 01:02:38.259
- I can't even fight with you. I'm sorry.
- Oh, my God.

01:02:38.421 --> 01:02:40.890
- I have to go to London.
- Unbelievable.

01:02:41.049 --> 01:02:42.609
I cannot be gone for seven days.

01:02:42.717 --> 01:02:45.596
You mean you can't be here
for seven days. What are you doing?

01:02:46.346 --> 01:02:48.314
- Sorry?
- Why are you skulking?

01:02:48.473 --> 01:02:50.851
I'm just, uh, you know...

01:02:51.017 --> 01:02:53.861
There it is. I'm looking for gum.
Sorry. Continue.

01:02:54.020 --> 01:02:55.818
- I gotta go, baby.
- Jesus Christ. Just go.

01:02:55.981 --> 01:02:58.541
Stop doing a little play
about how you have to go and go already.

01:02:58.692 --> 01:03:00.990
That's so sweet of you. Thank you.

01:03:02.028 --> 01:03:05.373
- Hey. Judd, can I ask you something?
- Yup.

01:03:05.532 --> 01:03:08.536
She doesn't really care that I'm leaving,
so why is she busting my balls?

01:03:08.702 --> 01:03:10.295
Uh...

01:03:11.746 --> 01:03:13.339
Well, maybe she does care.

01:03:13.498 --> 01:03:17.753
Heh. I'm an asshole, Judd.
I'm not stupid.

01:03:18.712 --> 01:03:19.759
Take care.

01:03:20.588 --> 01:03:22.636
You too.

01:03:47.949 --> 01:03:50.247
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:03:53.330 --> 01:03:54.798
No Barry?

01:03:56.624 --> 01:03:57.750
Barry's gone.

01:03:59.085 --> 01:04:00.257
How you doing?

01:04:00.920 --> 01:04:02.422
I'm fine.

01:04:03.673 --> 01:04:04.765
Excuse me.

01:04:05.633 --> 01:04:08.603
- Yes.
- You're so not fine.

01:04:09.346 --> 01:04:13.522
You know, sleeping with your shrink does not
technically make you a relationship expert.

01:04:13.683 --> 01:04:15.685
Yeah. But I am an expert in you.

01:04:15.852 --> 01:04:17.399
- No, you're not.
- Yes, I am.

01:04:17.562 --> 01:04:18.939
You raised me.

01:04:20.982 --> 01:04:23.326
You're the voice in my head.

01:04:24.778 --> 01:04:28.203
Not Mom. It's not Dad. You.

01:04:29.157 --> 01:04:31.706
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:04:32.869 --> 01:04:36.544
And sometimes I just wish
you would shut the fuck up.

01:04:39.584 --> 01:04:42.212
What do you want?
What do you want?

01:04:42.796 --> 01:04:45.424
I just want you to know
it's okay to be fine.

01:04:46.633 --> 01:04:48.510
That you deserve to be fine.

01:04:50.845 --> 01:04:52.097
Thank you.

01:04:53.139 --> 01:04:54.982
You're welcome.

01:04:55.809 --> 01:04:57.106
Will you carry this?

01:04:58.478 --> 01:04:59.821
Oh, God.

01:05:01.898 --> 01:05:03.366
Holy shit.

01:05:03.525 --> 01:05:06.574
Oh, how dare you. That is not cool.
I will pants you from up here.

01:05:06.736 --> 01:05:08.989
- You do not get to say I'm heavy.
- No more pizza.

01:05:09.155 --> 01:05:11.836
Don't make me stand next to
your girlfriend for seven days...

01:05:11.991 --> 01:05:14.460
...and then fucking
say I'm heavy.

01:05:33.138 --> 01:05:37.689
<i>Hi, Judd. Look.
I am really sorry about the other day.</i>

01:05:37.851 --> 01:05:42.448
<i>I just hope that you'll
come by and see me.</i>

01:05:42.605 --> 01:05:47.281
<i>I'm in Room 346. So please, uh...</i>

01:05:47.444 --> 01:05:49.367
<i>Bye.</i>

01:06:18.475 --> 01:06:20.398
Morning.

01:06:21.728 --> 01:06:23.230
Do you ever sleep?

01:06:23.396 --> 01:06:25.899
Heh. Not lately.

01:06:27.317 --> 01:06:28.739
So.

01:06:29.235 --> 01:06:31.283
Horry. Huh?

01:06:31.446 --> 01:06:33.244
Are you surprised?

01:06:34.365 --> 01:06:36.085
The single advantage
of being me nowadays...

01:06:36.242 --> 01:06:38.995
...is it's very hard to surprise me.
So no.

01:06:41.581 --> 01:06:45.461
- I'm not Quinn, Judd.
- I know.

01:06:45.627 --> 01:06:48.301
- Please don't look at me like I'm Quinn.
- I'm not.

01:06:48.463 --> 01:06:51.842
This is different than your thing.
This is not like your thing.

01:06:52.008 --> 01:06:54.932
Heh. I get it.

01:06:58.097 --> 01:07:00.646
We were so in love, Judd.

01:07:02.227 --> 01:07:06.698
And now he's alone.
He's, like, permanently alone.

01:07:07.440 --> 01:07:11.035
And Barry is just...?

01:07:12.612 --> 01:07:15.331
I will never love Barry
the way that I loved Horry.

01:07:15.490 --> 01:07:18.619
And I will never love anybody else
like that. Ever.

01:07:18.785 --> 01:07:21.288
I would not do that to Horry.

01:07:24.791 --> 01:07:27.795
Is it the whole world, or
is it just this family?

01:07:27.961 --> 01:07:31.306
You and Barry.
And me and Quinn.

01:07:31.464 --> 01:07:35.310
And Phillip and Tracy.
And Paul and Annie.

01:07:35.468 --> 01:07:37.687
No one is happy.

01:07:39.264 --> 01:07:42.017
The one person that's got it figured out
in this family is Cole.

01:07:42.183 --> 01:07:45.107
You know, he sits on that can and he
takes his dump, and he's super happy.

01:07:45.270 --> 01:07:48.820
- Ha, ha.
- You show me one happy adult.

01:07:48.982 --> 01:07:53.829
Everybody's sad or angry...

01:07:53.987 --> 01:07:56.160
...or lying or cheating.

01:07:56.322 --> 01:07:59.997
I think Quinn's pregnancy
is just freaking you out.

01:08:00.159 --> 01:08:02.708
Yeah, it's freaking me out.

01:08:04.414 --> 01:08:08.635
Three months ago I had a great job and a nice
apartment and I was in love with my wife.

01:08:08.793 --> 01:08:10.670
- No, you weren't.
- No?

01:08:10.837 --> 01:08:14.592
No. She was sleeping with somebody else
for a year and you never noticed.

01:08:14.799 --> 01:08:17.018
How in love could you have been?

01:08:19.929 --> 01:08:21.555
Yep.

01:08:26.935 --> 01:08:28.938
That's fair.

01:08:29.689 --> 01:08:34.866
Sure like to think I could still do that,
though, with someone.

01:08:35.444 --> 01:08:38.870
That I can just find someone
and fall in love and have it last.

01:08:39.032 --> 01:08:43.502
That seems impossible
to me right now.

01:08:45.121 --> 01:08:47.715
Love causes cancer.
Like everything else.

01:08:47.874 --> 01:08:51.970
But it's still love.
It has its moments.

01:08:52.962 --> 01:08:56.182
I had a moment with
Penny the other night.

01:08:57.884 --> 01:08:59.430
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:08:59.594 --> 01:09:00.890
Really?

01:09:02.971 --> 01:09:05.770
Starting to do complicated.
You proud of me?

01:09:05.933 --> 01:09:08.277
Well, I don't know.
How does it feel?

01:09:08.435 --> 01:09:10.404
Complicated.

01:09:19.738 --> 01:09:22.117
I mean, that's the gist of it.
But, you know.

01:09:22.283 --> 01:09:24.251
Anyway. How you
doing, Uncle Joe?

01:09:24.410 --> 01:09:25.832
- This is Trish.
- Hi, everyone.

01:09:25.995 --> 01:09:28.417
By the way, we're
sleeping together.

01:09:28.581 --> 01:09:30.754
<i>- Mazel.</i>
Ha-ha-ha.

01:09:30.917 --> 01:09:33.090
Mom. Why is Paul
allowed to miss this?

01:09:33.252 --> 01:09:34.892
- Trish is a nurse.
- Retired.

01:09:34.921 --> 01:09:35.921
He had a call.

01:09:36.089 --> 01:09:38.729
She still wears her uniform sometimes,
if you take my meaning.

01:09:38.883 --> 01:09:41.962
- Honey, I think the baby's waking up.
- The baby's in the kitchen with Linda.

01:09:42.053 --> 01:09:44.093
- <i>Oh!</i>
- Then who am I hearing?

01:09:44.180 --> 01:09:47.301
<i>- Are you hard? Are you hard?</i>
<i>- Jesus Christ, Annie.</i>

01:09:47.433 --> 01:09:48.479
<i>Put it in me.</i>

01:09:48.643 --> 01:09:51.772
- Oh, crap. I left the baby monitor on upstairs.
- I'll get it.

01:09:51.938 --> 01:09:53.781
There you go. Sorry
about that, everyone.

01:09:53.939 --> 01:09:56.318
<i>- Put your dick in me.</i>
- Where was it before?

01:09:56.484 --> 01:09:57.684
<i>Oh, do it. Do it, Paul.</i>

01:09:57.819 --> 01:09:59.662
- Turn it off.
- Turn it up?

01:09:59.821 --> 01:10:01.541
<i>- Stop talking, sweetie.</i>
- Turn it up.

01:10:01.572 --> 01:10:03.620
<i>- It feels so good.</i>
<i>- Stop talking.</i>

01:10:03.783 --> 01:10:05.285
Come on, people.
It's just sex.

01:10:05.451 --> 01:10:06.651
- Sweetie.
- What?

01:10:06.661 --> 01:10:07.861
<i>- Shut up.</i>
<i>- Okay.</i>

01:10:07.870 --> 01:10:11.295
- He just told her to shut up.
- Okay, he's slowing down.

01:10:12.125 --> 01:10:13.968
No, this is good.
He's too fast anyway.

01:10:14.127 --> 01:10:17.097
It's the circle of life, everybody.
Let's go, Altmans.

01:10:17.255 --> 01:10:20.805
<i>Yes. I can feel you. I can feel it.
Yes. You're so hard.</i>

01:10:20.967 --> 01:10:23.140
<i>- Come! Come now! Coming! Come!</i>
- Ha-ha-ha.

01:10:23.302 --> 01:10:24.770
Linda, thank you.

01:10:25.888 --> 01:10:27.640
<i>There we go.
There we go. Oh, do it.</i>

01:10:27.807 --> 01:10:29.150
It has a backup battery.

01:10:29.308 --> 01:10:31.481
<i>- Put a baby in me, Paul.</i>
- That's a nice feature.

01:10:31.644 --> 01:10:33.317
<i>Shove a baby up there!
Shove a bab...!</i>

01:10:33.479 --> 01:10:34.696
Oh.

01:10:35.231 --> 01:10:38.326
- What is wrong with you?
- I'm ashamed.

01:10:38.484 --> 01:10:41.829
Save money, everybody.
Free of charge. Enjoy.

01:10:41.988 --> 01:10:46.164
It was just incredibly awkward,
and it just didn't stop.

01:10:46.325 --> 01:10:48.327
Oh, my God.
And everybody heard?

01:10:48.494 --> 01:10:50.496
Yeah. I like when you laugh.

01:10:50.747 --> 01:10:53.671
- I like that you like it.
- Yeah.

01:10:53.833 --> 01:10:58.009
You know that this is the worst possible
time this could be happening, Penny?

01:10:58.671 --> 01:11:01.140
I know, but...

01:11:02.508 --> 01:11:04.681
...I'm gonna kiss you anyway.

01:11:15.855 --> 01:11:16.947
You're so good at that.

01:11:18.649 --> 01:11:22.028
- You're very easily pleased.
- Is that a crime? You should try it sometime.

01:11:22.195 --> 01:11:26.245
- Hello.
- Judd. Something's wrong. I'm bleeding.

01:11:26.407 --> 01:11:28.127
What do you mean, you're bleeding?
How much?

01:11:28.284 --> 01:11:31.037
A lot. I'm gonna lose this one too.
I don't know what to do.

01:11:31.204 --> 01:11:33.252
I'm gonna hang up.
I'm gonna call an ambulance.

01:11:33.414 --> 01:11:36.167
I want you to stay calm. Okay?
I'm gonna hang up right now.

01:11:42.256 --> 01:11:46.386
Hi, there is a pregnant woman having problems
at the Renaissance just off Route 100.

01:11:46.552 --> 01:11:47.974
She's in Room 346.

01:11:48.137 --> 01:11:49.980
Yeah. Okay.

01:11:50.139 --> 01:11:53.439
Yes, this number's fine. Thank you.

01:11:55.102 --> 01:11:57.230
- Quinn's pregnant?
- Yeah.

01:11:57.980 --> 01:11:59.027
And it's yours?

01:12:04.153 --> 01:12:05.200
You gotta go.

01:12:06.823 --> 01:12:08.263
Penny, this is something I wanted...

01:12:08.366 --> 01:12:11.586
No. It's fine. There's a pregnant woman.
She's bleeding. You gotta go.

01:12:11.744 --> 01:12:13.917
Yeah. Yeah. I'll talk to you tonight.

01:12:26.425 --> 01:12:28.348
Hi. How you doing? Are you okay?

01:12:28.553 --> 01:12:30.647
- There's no heartbeat.
- There's no heartbeat?

01:12:30.805 --> 01:12:33.325
- I can't believe this is happening again.
- Take it easy.

01:12:33.432 --> 01:12:37.312
- Nothing is happening again. Okay?
- I deserve this. I do. I ruined us.

01:12:37.478 --> 01:12:39.776
- Please. We're not doing that here.
- Quiet.

01:12:41.607 --> 01:12:42.904
What's that?

01:12:44.777 --> 01:12:48.122
- There's your baby's heartbeat.
- Okay.

01:12:48.281 --> 01:12:51.911
All right.
Baby was just in a weird position, huh?

01:12:52.076 --> 01:12:54.920
Mm-hm.
- Okay.

01:12:55.955 --> 01:12:57.878
That's our baby.

01:13:04.338 --> 01:13:07.842
Hey, I got here as quick as I could.
My GPS was... Sorry about that.

01:13:08.009 --> 01:13:10.057
- Are you okay?
- Oh. Yeah.

01:13:10.219 --> 01:13:12.221
- Mm-hm.
- You had me so scared.

01:13:12.388 --> 01:13:14.061
- Oh.
- Made a couple calls, huh?

01:13:14.223 --> 01:13:15.623
You all right? What happened?

01:13:16.392 --> 01:13:18.645
Hello, hello, hello. Dr. Rausch.

01:13:18.811 --> 01:13:20.905
- Mr. and Mrs. Altman?
- I'm Mr. Altman.

01:13:21.355 --> 01:13:22.447
And you are?

01:13:22.607 --> 01:13:26.328
That's just a guy
that Mrs. Altman was fucking.

01:13:26.485 --> 01:13:27.657
Uh-huh.
- In my bed.

01:13:27.820 --> 01:13:29.163
Judd, please, not now.

01:13:29.322 --> 01:13:32.747
You just walk out on everyone at the station,
grow a beard and now you're a smart-ass?

01:13:32.909 --> 01:13:34.661
Wade Beaufort. It's complicated.

01:13:34.827 --> 01:13:38.001
Well, I'll simplify it.
Both of you get out of my exam room.

01:13:38.164 --> 01:13:40.508
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:13:40.833 --> 01:13:43.427
- You got us kicked out.
- And you too, sir.

01:13:43.628 --> 01:13:46.256
- Here we go.
- I'll be in the waiting room.

01:13:48.382 --> 01:13:49.429
So.

01:13:49.634 --> 01:13:51.136
That should do it, right?

01:13:51.302 --> 01:13:54.681
I didn't sign, because I think my wife...
Or the patient should sign right there.

01:13:54.847 --> 01:13:56.349
There you go.

01:13:57.266 --> 01:13:59.519
Is that where she should sign?
I'll just leave that here.

01:13:59.685 --> 01:14:01.232
Don't be a goddamn baby, Judd.

01:14:01.395 --> 01:14:03.989
I extend an olive branch,
and you're gonna pitch it in the trash?

01:14:04.148 --> 01:14:07.668
You're not gonna stay with her. We know that.
The only person that doesn't know is Quinn.

01:14:07.818 --> 01:14:10.698
That's what's gonna happen? You're
clairvoyant? You know what's going on?

01:14:10.863 --> 01:14:12.303
I don't need to listen to your crap.

01:14:12.448 --> 01:14:15.048
- You don't know what you're talking about.
- It's the <i>Man Up</i> guy.

01:14:15.117 --> 01:14:18.212
What's up, dudes? You don't know me.
What are you talking about?

01:14:18.371 --> 01:14:20.373
Is there another waiting room
with more chairs?

01:14:20.539 --> 01:14:21.540
- I don't know you?
- No.

01:14:21.707 --> 01:14:24.631
I've been with you for seven years.
Don't tell me I don't know you.

01:14:24.794 --> 01:14:27.718
And I know you'll fuck just about anyone
who'll have you.

01:14:27.880 --> 01:14:30.383
That's interns. That's sales reps.
That's sponsors.

01:14:30.549 --> 01:14:33.519
So don't tell me you're not already drawing
up plans for the quickest exit.

01:14:33.678 --> 01:14:36.431
You're logging all the ass I'm crushing,
and I'm the perv?

01:14:36.597 --> 01:14:38.237
Hey, fellas. We got some young boys here.

01:14:38.391 --> 01:14:40.564
Scoutmaster. Park it.
We're in the middle of something.

01:14:40.726 --> 01:14:43.149
I didn't fuck her
any more than she fucked me.

01:14:43.312 --> 01:14:47.112
- It takes two to tango, all right?
- That's a separate situation that I'll deal with.

01:14:47.274 --> 01:14:50.234
- That's a party for two.
- Don't worry about her. We're talking about you.

01:14:50.361 --> 01:14:51.578
Take this discussion outside.

01:14:51.737 --> 01:14:53.330
- Sorry.
- What's going on, Judd?

01:14:53.489 --> 01:14:56.333
- Listen to me. She fucked me.
- Yeah, I heard you the first time.

01:14:57.243 --> 01:14:59.166
- Stop it, you guys.
- Judd.

01:14:59.328 --> 01:15:01.581
Really?
Look who's gonna man up now.

01:15:01.747 --> 01:15:03.340
Everybody just be quiet!

01:15:03.791 --> 01:15:07.261
Now, we just are all gonna
just take a beat here.

01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:08.672
I'm not fighting.

01:15:08.838 --> 01:15:11.682
Who the fuck are you coming in here
with this middle part at your age...

01:15:11.841 --> 01:15:13.041
...barking orders at everyone?

01:15:13.175 --> 01:15:15.519
Who the hell am I?
I'm Wendy Altman, bitch.

01:15:18.014 --> 01:15:19.857
- Ow. Shit.
- That's what happens.

01:15:20.016 --> 01:15:22.940
Yeah. That's a fucking princess cut.
You fucking clown.

01:15:23.102 --> 01:15:24.945
- Are you kidding me?
- Dick.

01:15:25.104 --> 01:15:27.448
You have your pussy...
You have your sister hit me?

01:15:27.606 --> 01:15:28.778
Yep. And I got her purse.

01:15:28.941 --> 01:15:31.444
Oh, yeah,
walk me out because I'm so dangerous.

01:15:31.610 --> 01:15:34.113
Like, a mother of two
with diapers in my purse.

01:15:34.280 --> 01:15:37.955
Here's the parking lot. Thank you.
I can find my way now. Thank you.

01:15:38.284 --> 01:15:40.912
- Great work, officers.
- Nice hats.

01:15:41.078 --> 01:15:44.457
Oh. I just got a great idea.
Let's stop acting like crazy people.

01:15:44.623 --> 01:15:46.466
- Yeah. I agree.
- I'm gonna get the car.

01:15:46.625 --> 01:15:48.218
That's a nice parking spot, huh?

01:15:48.377 --> 01:15:50.004
Is that Wade's car?

01:15:50.171 --> 01:15:54.142
- That's one of his cars. He's got a few.
- He has a few?

01:15:54.300 --> 01:15:56.143
Think he's compensating
for something?

01:15:56.302 --> 01:15:59.181
Yeah. For having too much money.

01:16:04.393 --> 01:16:06.395
You know,
I heard the baby's heartbeat in there.

01:16:07.271 --> 01:16:08.693
That's great.

01:16:09.315 --> 01:16:10.783
Right?

01:16:13.694 --> 01:16:16.823
I'm gonna have to forgive her
for the sake of that kid, aren't I?

01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:18.453
Well, I'm no expert...

01:16:18.616 --> 01:16:21.696
...but I think you're gonna have to make
much larger sacrifices down the road.

01:16:21.827 --> 01:16:24.330
Yeah. That's true.

01:16:24.497 --> 01:16:27.501
You sounded almost wise
there for a minute.

01:16:27.666 --> 01:16:28.667
Right?

01:16:32.004 --> 01:16:35.679
All right. You go ahead. I'm gonna meet up
with you guys back at home.

01:16:35.841 --> 01:16:39.186
Hey, sis. That was a great shot.
Thanks for the help.

01:16:39.345 --> 01:16:42.349
Well, you guys are idiots.
But you're my idiots.

01:16:42.515 --> 01:16:43.687
Drive safe.

01:16:43.849 --> 01:16:46.853
Are you kidding me?
It's 2014. Okay?

01:16:50.773 --> 01:16:52.293
- There they go.
- Later, man.

01:16:52.441 --> 01:16:53.863
Take it easy.

01:16:56.946 --> 01:16:59.540
Uh, fellas, before you go...

01:16:59.698 --> 01:17:01.120
You see this nice car here?

01:17:01.283 --> 01:17:05.789
I've got $43 that says
you can't flip it over.

01:17:05.955 --> 01:17:09.209
- Man, what'd he do to you, anyway?
- He slept with my wife.

01:17:09.375 --> 01:17:11.469
- What do you say?
- Keep the money, Bro.

01:17:11.627 --> 01:17:13.095
- Let's do it.
- Really?

01:17:13.254 --> 01:17:15.382
- Come on, boys. Do it. Really.
- Oh, boy.

01:17:15.548 --> 01:17:16.720
- Bend your knees.
- Come on.

01:17:18.551 --> 01:17:20.303
There it goes. You got it!

01:17:23.347 --> 01:17:24.690
Ha-ha-ha. Whoo!

01:17:24.849 --> 01:17:26.226
- That was good.
- Later, dude.

01:17:26.392 --> 01:17:27.564
Very nice.

01:17:27.726 --> 01:17:30.286
- Are you serious?
- Come on, man. Get out of here.

01:17:34.775 --> 01:17:36.903
I did not expect that from you.

01:17:37.653 --> 01:17:40.247
You know,
the saddest thing about this whole mess...

01:17:40.406 --> 01:17:42.454
...is you were one of
my only real friends.

01:17:43.075 --> 01:17:44.122
I was your employee.

01:17:44.743 --> 01:17:46.290
Even sadder.

01:17:46.453 --> 01:17:50.083
Look, bud, um,
I'm sorry how this whole thing shook out.

01:17:50.583 --> 01:17:54.258
You know, I'm looking at you up there
with her, and there's a baby on the way.

01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:57.424
She's in there bawling about a heartbeat,
and, buddy, I don't even hear it.

01:17:57.590 --> 01:18:00.630
I don't even think the doctor hears it.
I think they're all in on this thing.

01:18:00.759 --> 01:18:03.603
And they're getting all emotional,
and it's just not me.

01:18:03.762 --> 01:18:05.935
I mean, I sure as shit
aren't a stepfather.

01:18:08.267 --> 01:18:10.520
- So is that it? Are you done?
- I'm out.

01:18:10.686 --> 01:18:12.359
- That's it?
- That's right.

01:18:12.521 --> 01:18:15.274
- It's what's best for everyone.
- You mean it's what's best for you.

01:18:15.441 --> 01:18:17.614
That's just a coincidence.

01:18:18.485 --> 01:18:22.115
I don't think that's drivable.
I'm gonna take myself a long walk.

01:18:22.948 --> 01:18:24.165
And thanks.

01:18:25.492 --> 01:18:26.539
For what?

01:18:27.036 --> 01:18:30.631
Up until just now, I thought I was
the most pathetic guy I knew.

01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:34.297
You're welcome.

01:18:36.795 --> 01:18:38.638
It really hurts when you punch someone.

01:18:38.797 --> 01:18:41.971
Thank God this was platinum. If this was
white gold, I would've broken my hand.

01:18:42.134 --> 01:18:44.808
- It makes me feel terrible.
- It was worth it.

01:18:44.970 --> 01:18:47.223
Like what I'm going
through doesn't matter.

01:18:47.431 --> 01:18:50.560
- I have got...
- I'm done. Never mind.

01:18:56.482 --> 01:18:58.234
What was that?

01:18:58.400 --> 01:19:00.323
It's just a slight disagreement.

01:19:00.945 --> 01:19:02.993
- Well, do you wanna talk about it?
- Uh...

01:19:03.155 --> 01:19:05.374
No, thanks. I have a headache.
I'm gonna go lie down.

01:19:06.325 --> 01:19:07.793
Well, what about shiva?

01:19:07.952 --> 01:19:11.331
I'm calling it
tonight on account of rain.

01:19:18.254 --> 01:19:19.801
Quinn?

01:19:19.964 --> 01:19:21.341
I'll be right back.

01:19:24.176 --> 01:19:26.053
Well...

01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:29.690
This is the part where you get to say
you were right.

01:19:29.848 --> 01:19:31.691
You were right.

01:19:32.393 --> 01:19:34.612
We got lost. I got lost.

01:19:36.188 --> 01:19:38.190
I got lost.

01:19:39.358 --> 01:19:44.330
But our baby, he will never be alone.
I promise you that.

01:19:44.697 --> 01:19:48.201
You were right. We don't need
to be married to be parents together.

01:19:48.367 --> 01:19:49.835
I'll be right in there with you.

01:19:52.496 --> 01:19:55.295
- She.
- What?

01:19:57.376 --> 01:19:59.003
She.

01:20:01.005 --> 01:20:03.349
- She.
- She.

01:20:25.404 --> 01:20:28.203
I can't believe he's really gone.

01:20:29.283 --> 01:20:31.331
I know, honey.

01:20:36.915 --> 01:20:39.509
These are actually pretty comfortable.

01:20:40.085 --> 01:20:41.382
- Yeah?
- Mm.

01:20:41.545 --> 01:20:43.138
Mm.

01:20:59.021 --> 01:21:02.867
Oh. Morning, Tracy.
I didn't know anyone else was up.

01:21:04.276 --> 01:21:07.371
- I didn't mean to intrude. You okay?
- That's okay. Mm-hm.

01:21:10.783 --> 01:21:13.161
- Hey, Judd.
- Yep?

01:21:20.376 --> 01:21:22.128
What would you say the odds are...

01:21:22.294 --> 01:21:26.344
...that your brother has had sex with
that Chelsea girl while we've been here?

01:21:26.840 --> 01:21:28.934
I mean, you know, I know
he's your brother...

01:21:29.093 --> 01:21:31.016
...but I could use a friend here.

01:21:31.178 --> 01:21:35.308
A little honesty for a change.
Just between you, me and the sunrise.

01:21:37.142 --> 01:21:38.644
The odds are pretty good.

01:21:39.978 --> 01:21:41.980
- I'm sorry.
- It's okay.

01:21:44.108 --> 01:21:45.826
I am a grown-up person.

01:21:45.984 --> 01:21:49.033
I am smart and professional.
I have my shit together.

01:21:50.364 --> 01:21:54.335
And your brother is a child
who's spent his entire life...

01:21:54.493 --> 01:21:58.339
...reeling in the slack
as fast as you guys will cut it for him.

01:21:59.331 --> 01:22:00.708
So, what are you gonna do?

01:22:00.874 --> 01:22:06.131
I think I'm gonna gather up
the tattered remnants of my dignity...

01:22:07.339 --> 01:22:08.591
...and say goodbye.

01:22:09.633 --> 01:22:11.306
That'll crush him, you know.

01:22:12.010 --> 01:22:13.478
I'll let him keep the Porsche.

01:22:13.929 --> 01:22:17.058
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:22:17.224 --> 01:22:18.904
I don't think he'll
have it for very long.

01:22:19.059 --> 01:22:21.187
He keeps leaving it unlocked
with the keys inside.

01:22:21.353 --> 01:22:23.276
Someone's just gonna
drive off with it.

01:22:23.439 --> 01:22:27.069
Phillip really isn't built
to hold on to things.

01:22:27.234 --> 01:22:31.956
Tracy, you are not the first woman
that's wanted to believe in Phillip.

01:22:32.114 --> 01:22:34.958
But you are far and
away the best one.

01:22:37.077 --> 01:22:38.704
Thanks.

01:22:47.713 --> 01:22:49.306
Hi.

01:22:50.716 --> 01:22:52.844
- Penny.
- I gotta go to work.

01:22:54.595 --> 01:22:56.438
Hang on one second.
Let me talk to you.

01:22:56.597 --> 01:22:58.645
- Quinn okay?
- Yes, she's fine.

01:22:58.807 --> 01:23:00.559
- And the baby?
- She's good too.

01:23:00.976 --> 01:23:03.070
- It's a girl? Congratulations.
- Yeah.

01:23:03.228 --> 01:23:05.276
- Will you talk to me for one second?
- What?

01:23:05.439 --> 01:23:08.943
I wanted to explain earlier.
Things got... I got the phone call...

01:23:09.109 --> 01:23:11.032
Hey. Look. I'm a big girl.

01:23:11.195 --> 01:23:13.948
You know, it's not like we were
going steady. It's just sex.

01:23:14.114 --> 01:23:16.583
No, it wasn't. You know that.
You know it was more than sex.

01:23:16.742 --> 01:23:19.040
No. It wasn't.

01:23:19.203 --> 01:23:21.752
If it was, then what
does that say about you?

01:23:21.914 --> 01:23:23.791
That's all it was.

01:23:23.957 --> 01:23:25.880
Hey, Penny. Let me...

01:23:35.552 --> 01:23:36.599
Oh, my goodness.

01:23:36.762 --> 01:23:39.936
So many amazing childhood memories
from this place. You smell it?

01:23:50.442 --> 01:23:51.944
Hey.

01:23:52.110 --> 01:23:53.953
- Oh, shit.
- You've been avoiding me.

01:23:54.947 --> 01:23:57.666
You grabbed my dick. Okay?
That's why I've been avoiding you.

01:23:57.824 --> 01:23:59.952
- I didn't mean to.
- Please. You didn't mean to.

01:24:00.118 --> 01:24:02.462
What'd you think you were gonna
find down there, Annie?

01:24:02.621 --> 01:24:03.793
I'm sorry, Judd.

01:24:07.292 --> 01:24:08.839
I just...

01:24:09.336 --> 01:24:12.966
- I want a baby so badly.
- Why don't you think about what you do have?

01:24:14.299 --> 01:24:15.391
You and Paul.

01:24:16.510 --> 01:24:18.512
You guys really love
each other, don't you?

01:24:19.555 --> 01:24:20.647
Yes.

01:24:21.139 --> 01:24:23.983
That's so much harder
than having a baby.

01:24:24.142 --> 01:24:28.067
I mean, it's, you know,
damn near impossible.

01:24:28.814 --> 01:24:33.160
And you'll have a baby, one way or another.
But do not screw up your marriage to do it.

01:24:35.904 --> 01:24:37.531
You're right.

01:24:38.824 --> 01:24:41.168
I know you're right.
I'm just the most pathetic person.

01:24:41.326 --> 01:24:43.829
No, you're not.
That's the last thing I'd call you, Annie.

01:24:43.996 --> 01:24:46.875
Oh, I can think of some other words
that I would use as well.

01:24:47.040 --> 01:24:49.338
- How about "determined," huh?
- Oh, my God.

01:24:49.501 --> 01:24:52.004
Someone came down
here very determined.

01:24:54.339 --> 01:24:56.683
Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's going on?

01:24:56.842 --> 01:24:58.970
The irony here
is that you made a fool out of me.

01:24:59.136 --> 01:25:01.309
No, I didn't. Wait.
Why is that ironic?

01:25:01.471 --> 01:25:04.315
That fact that he doesn't know
why it's ironic is ironic.

01:25:04.474 --> 01:25:06.602
I gotta go.
Thank you all so much.

01:25:06.768 --> 01:25:09.848
- We can have a conversation about this.
- We've had the conversation already.

01:25:09.938 --> 01:25:11.698
- I wanna have it again.
- I saw this coming.

01:25:11.773 --> 01:25:13.213
He can wait for one second.

01:25:13.358 --> 01:25:15.038
- Scale of 1 to 10.
- Shut up.

01:25:15.193 --> 01:25:17.354
- Was it how you remembered?
- Oh, my God.

01:25:17.362 --> 01:25:19.956
- Annie?
- Hey, buddy.

01:25:20.115 --> 01:25:23.039
- What the hell's going on here?
- We're just having a talk.

01:25:23.201 --> 01:25:27.331
Your marriage goes to shit, now you're hitting on
my wife. Don't think I don't see you look at her.

01:25:27.497 --> 01:25:30.250
- Don't come over here.
- You have wanted to do this for years.

01:25:30.417 --> 01:25:31.464
Come back here!

01:25:31.627 --> 01:25:33.846
- Put your suitcase down and talk to me.
- I need to go.

01:25:34.004 --> 01:25:36.553
- Move. Move.
- Get back here. We're not done.

01:25:36.715 --> 01:25:38.388
No, goddamn it! Stop!

01:25:39.635 --> 01:25:41.933
- Get off me. Get off me.
- Paul!

01:25:42.095 --> 01:25:45.725
- Oh, yes!
- Stop. Please. Let's just talk about this.

01:25:45.891 --> 01:25:48.189
- I saw it with my own eyes.
- Stop it!

01:25:48.352 --> 01:25:50.571
- Nothing happened!
- Nothing happened!

01:25:50.729 --> 01:25:52.902
- Your brothers can't fight for shit.
- No.

01:25:53.065 --> 01:25:55.238
It's kind of embarrassing, actually.

01:25:55.400 --> 01:25:58.745
- Will you two get in there and stop this?
- Are you kidding? This is amaz... Ow!

01:25:58.904 --> 01:26:01.327
- Stop fighting me.
- Get him off of me!

01:26:01.490 --> 01:26:05.245
If it gets to the point where I think you're
being idiots, you're probably being idiots.

01:26:05.994 --> 01:26:08.918
- Stop. Stop it. What's going on?
- He kissed my wife.

01:26:09.081 --> 01:26:11.334
- No, I didn't.
- No, he didn't.

01:26:11.500 --> 01:26:13.252
Paul. Nothing happened.

01:26:13.418 --> 01:26:15.841
Could you not get in the car
till we work this out?

01:26:16.004 --> 01:26:19.554
It would never have worked, Phillip.
You're a narcissist with Oedipal issues.

01:26:19.716 --> 01:26:21.844
- I'm a classic enabler.
- But I love you. Ow.

01:26:22.010 --> 01:26:24.559
- I need an adult.
- I am an adult!

01:26:25.138 --> 01:26:26.618
- Oh, God.
- Stop that. Get off!

01:26:26.640 --> 01:26:28.608
- Damn it, I'm talking to you.
- No, stay on him.

01:26:28.767 --> 01:26:30.769
Since when have you run away
from discussions?

01:26:30.936 --> 01:26:32.856
- Stop it!
- Get back here. We're not done.

01:26:32.938 --> 01:26:34.281
You love discussions!

01:26:34.439 --> 01:26:36.362
- Stop it! Stop it!
- Oh, my God.

01:26:36.525 --> 01:26:39.199
- If I get wet, you are dead.
- No. No. Somebody stop him.

01:26:39.361 --> 01:26:41.864
- Boner! Boner!
- Unbelievable. Judd.

01:26:42.030 --> 01:26:44.328
- You can let go any time you want.
- No.

01:26:44.491 --> 01:26:47.091
- You can let go.
- Can we stop being a reality show?

01:26:47.244 --> 01:26:50.714
I don't care. You think you can
hurt me any more than I already am?

01:26:50.872 --> 01:26:52.340
Leave it alone.

01:26:55.127 --> 01:26:56.299
What the fuck?

01:27:10.434 --> 01:27:13.483
I guess this is as
good a time as any.

01:27:19.943 --> 01:27:22.287
Did you guys not
know about that?

01:27:24.573 --> 01:27:28.669
Linda was helping me take care of
your father. Long, hard nights, huh?

01:27:28.827 --> 01:27:30.670
I don't know how to explain
how it happened.

01:27:31.163 --> 01:27:33.507
- Did Dad know?
- Of course.

01:27:33.665 --> 01:27:36.669
Your father was a very enlightened man,
sexually speaking.

01:27:36.835 --> 01:27:38.587
Let me tell you a story
about your father.

01:27:38.754 --> 01:27:40.097
- Don't.
- I wish you wouldn't.

01:27:40.255 --> 01:27:43.555
When Horry got hurt
and I was drowning in medical bills...

01:27:43.717 --> 01:27:48.188
...your father paid our mortgage for a
full year so we wouldn't lose the house.

01:27:48.346 --> 01:27:52.567
Your father was like family to me. And he
died knowing your mother wouldn't be alone.

01:27:53.101 --> 01:27:54.694
Why didn't you tell us?

01:27:54.853 --> 01:27:57.356
You needed to mourn your father
without any distractions.

01:27:57.522 --> 01:28:00.025
Uh, wait a minute, Mom.

01:28:00.192 --> 01:28:02.536
This whole shiva thing.

01:28:03.028 --> 01:28:04.701
It wasn't Dad's idea, was it?

01:28:05.405 --> 01:28:06.577
Smart boy.

01:28:06.740 --> 01:28:09.243
- Oh, Mom.
- How could you lie to us like that?

01:28:09.409 --> 01:28:12.879
You wouldn't have stayed if I didn't.
And I needed you all here.

01:28:13.038 --> 01:28:15.416
And you needed each other,
even if you couldn't see it.

01:28:15.582 --> 01:28:18.051
If we didn't come here,
Tracy wouldn't have broken up with me.

01:28:18.210 --> 01:28:20.133
So thank you for
ruining my life.

01:28:20.295 --> 01:28:23.265
I think it's time you took some
small measure of responsibility...

01:28:23.423 --> 01:28:25.391
...for where you choose
to put your own penis.

01:28:25.550 --> 01:28:30.727
Could you please not talk about my penis?
I can't begin to tell you how creepy it is.

01:28:30.889 --> 01:28:34.018
When he was little he thought
it was a Tootsie Roll. You remember that?

01:28:34.184 --> 01:28:35.936
I used to see him over
and try to ah, ah...

01:28:36.102 --> 01:28:38.070
No, no, no!

01:28:38.230 --> 01:28:40.431
<i>- La, la, la.</i>
- Phillip. Phillip. Hey, Phillip.

01:28:40.524 --> 01:28:43.243
That's terrible to listen to.
Take a seat. Take a seat, pal.

01:28:43.401 --> 01:28:45.074
I get it. This is
a private moment.

01:28:45.237 --> 01:28:49.242
Unless you wanna talk more about Phillip's
Tootsie Roll and the way he licks it.

01:28:50.575 --> 01:28:53.954
So I am gonna head out. Okay?
That's it for me.

01:28:54.162 --> 01:28:56.005
Have a good one.

01:28:57.833 --> 01:29:01.463
- See you, Boner.
- Are you kidding me with that?

01:29:01.628 --> 01:29:03.255
- Was it you?
- Yeah.

01:29:03.421 --> 01:29:07.096
All right. So, again...

01:29:19.813 --> 01:29:23.113
No, no. No. No. Goddamn it.

01:29:41.960 --> 01:29:46.181
Okay, J, come on. Hey. Hey.
You just took a spill. That's all.

01:29:46.339 --> 01:29:50.060
Okay, buddy?
There you go. There you go.

01:29:50.218 --> 01:29:53.643
Now give me a smile. Okay?

01:29:53.805 --> 01:29:56.058
Okay, J.

01:29:56.224 --> 01:29:57.976
You're okay.

01:29:58.143 --> 01:30:01.647
Wah, wah.

01:30:02.147 --> 01:30:03.694
Okay.

01:30:06.735 --> 01:30:08.078
Judd, honey. Judd.

01:30:08.236 --> 01:30:10.830
Judd. Judd. Judd. Oh, God.

01:30:10.989 --> 01:30:13.663
Thank God.
You scared me to death.

01:30:13.825 --> 01:30:15.577
Are you all right?

01:30:18.997 --> 01:30:20.840
Go ahead.

01:30:26.838 --> 01:30:28.590
J.

01:30:29.341 --> 01:30:32.720
Dad, when I was little,
he used to call me J.

01:30:33.386 --> 01:30:35.184
I remember.

01:30:36.348 --> 01:30:38.316
I remember.

01:30:45.732 --> 01:30:47.700
I know.

01:30:53.198 --> 01:30:54.871
I'm so glad you're okay.

01:30:58.870 --> 01:31:00.998
I'm so glad you tightened this.

01:31:20.558 --> 01:31:23.437
- Hi.
- You're not allowed on the ice in shoes.

01:31:23.603 --> 01:31:26.072
- I just wanna say something and then I'll go.
- Judd.

01:31:26.231 --> 01:31:27.733
My mom is in love.

01:31:28.316 --> 01:31:29.568
Well, that's nice for her.

01:31:29.734 --> 01:31:31.907
The specifics are
very hard to explain.

01:31:32.070 --> 01:31:33.743
Um, very, very hard.

01:31:33.905 --> 01:31:35.578
But I realized something.

01:31:35.740 --> 01:31:38.118
I have never been in love.
Not like that.

01:31:38.284 --> 01:31:42.585
I've been too busy chasing this idea
that I had about this perfect life...

01:31:42.747 --> 01:31:44.749
...and life is not perfect.

01:31:44.916 --> 01:31:46.634
It shouldn't be perfect.

01:31:46.793 --> 01:31:50.093
It should be unpredictable
and irrational...

01:31:51.214 --> 01:31:52.591
...and complicated.

01:31:53.758 --> 01:31:57.103
And I want a complicated life...

01:31:57.262 --> 01:31:59.765
...where I can love
someone like that.

01:32:00.598 --> 01:32:01.941
- Judd...
- And, now, listen.

01:32:02.100 --> 01:32:04.228
I don't know if things
would ever work out between us.

01:32:04.394 --> 01:32:06.692
I'm emotionally inept,
and you're a little strange.

01:32:07.313 --> 01:32:09.782
You know, right?
A little bit.

01:32:09.941 --> 01:32:13.491
But you're a great strange.

01:32:13.653 --> 01:32:15.621
You're honest.

01:32:15.780 --> 01:32:17.828
And you're so...

01:32:19.492 --> 01:32:20.994
You're good.

01:32:21.161 --> 01:32:24.961
And I think that
maybe someday...

01:32:25.123 --> 01:32:28.969
...we could love each
other like that.

01:32:29.961 --> 01:32:32.305
And I'm sorry that I hurt you.

01:32:33.339 --> 01:32:35.307
I didn't mean to.

01:32:36.760 --> 01:32:38.558
Where do you go from here?

01:32:39.012 --> 01:32:41.936
I don't know. I don't know.

01:32:42.098 --> 01:32:44.647
Six months, I'm gonna be a dad.

01:32:45.310 --> 01:32:49.611
And I've never been alone,
so I was thinking that I would try that.

01:32:51.483 --> 01:32:56.489
Well, you know I'm not a fan of small talk,
so I'm gonna give you a hug...

01:32:56.654 --> 01:32:59.328
...and wish you Godspeed.

01:33:01.117 --> 01:33:04.496
Be good, Judd Altman.

01:33:04.662 --> 01:33:06.664
Bye, Penny.

- Oh, my God. That was some speech.
- Thanks.

01:33:21.304 --> 01:33:24.558
That was amazing. I love the part
where you said I was strange.

01:33:24.724 --> 01:33:28.024
I did say that, didn't I?
I was hoping I heard myself wrong.

01:33:28.186 --> 01:33:29.688
Was that all right?

01:33:29.854 --> 01:33:34.325
So when you get your act together,
you should call me.

01:33:35.026 --> 01:33:38.200
- Yeah. Did I not say that?
- No.

01:33:38.571 --> 01:33:39.663
I didn't say I'm calling?

01:33:39.823 --> 01:33:43.248
No. You just were like, I'm weird,
but we could still be good together.

01:33:43.409 --> 01:33:47.084
And we could love each other. You know,
you want your alone time for six months.

01:33:47.247 --> 01:33:51.468
- Walk around, maybe get to think about things.
- Definitely meant to say I'm calling in six months.

01:33:51.626 --> 01:33:55.426
It was the whole reason to come here.
I'm so sorry.

01:33:57.715 --> 01:33:59.012
Hmm.

01:34:02.720 --> 01:34:04.222
They're playing our song.

01:34:04.389 --> 01:34:06.858
Yeah, does Cyndi Lauper
have to be our song?

01:34:07.016 --> 01:34:12.944

01:34:20.280 --> 01:34:22.954
It's okay to cry, honey.
Or laugh.

01:34:23.116 --> 01:34:25.915
- There's no correct response.
- I know, Mommy.

01:34:26.870 --> 01:34:28.087
- Mwah.
- Stay in touch, okay?

01:34:28.246 --> 01:34:31.125
Sissy, my turn, my turn, my turn.
Oh, yeah.

01:34:31.291 --> 01:34:33.544
Buckle that good.
Is it buckled? Okay, good.

01:34:33.710 --> 01:34:35.257
- Bye, Wendy.
- Bye, Annie.

01:34:35.420 --> 01:34:37.514
All right. Drive safe.

01:34:40.425 --> 01:34:41.426
I love you, Judd.

01:34:42.093 --> 01:34:44.642
Are you gonna be okay
with those two little kids on the plane?

01:34:44.804 --> 01:34:47.557
Deflecting emotion with logistics.
Nice.

01:34:47.724 --> 01:34:50.068
Well, it's what we do.

01:34:50.226 --> 01:34:51.787
I'm gonna come in
when the baby's born.

01:34:51.936 --> 01:34:53.404
- You keep me posted.
- I will.

01:34:53.563 --> 01:34:55.611
- No, you won't. But I'm coming anyway.
- Heh.

01:34:57.233 --> 01:35:00.533
- Goodbye.
- I'll see you soon, Dad.

01:35:00.695 --> 01:35:02.948
- Mm.
- Heh.

01:35:42.445 --> 01:35:43.742
And then there were three.

01:35:45.031 --> 01:35:48.501
So Mom just wakes up one morning
and decides she's a lesbian.

01:35:48.660 --> 01:35:50.958
Yeah,
it's been that kind of week, hasn't it?

01:35:53.206 --> 01:35:54.503
So...

01:35:55.583 --> 01:35:57.381
- Phillip.
- Needs a job.

01:35:57.543 --> 01:36:00.012
- You need a job.
- I'll be okay.

01:36:00.755 --> 01:36:02.302
Do you really believe that?

01:36:05.510 --> 01:36:07.353
I'm getting there.

01:36:12.475 --> 01:36:14.819
Dad always had a soft spot for him,
didn't he?

01:36:14.978 --> 01:36:17.058
I think he liked us
because we were kind of like him.

01:36:17.188 --> 01:36:19.111
He likes Phillip
because he was nothing like him.

01:36:22.110 --> 01:36:24.863
Okay, I'll bring him
into the business.

01:36:25.029 --> 01:36:26.702
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

01:36:26.864 --> 01:36:30.710
Oh, Paul. You are a good guy.
The secret's out.

01:36:30.868 --> 01:36:33.542
He's the good brother.
Very cool of you. Thank you.

01:36:33.705 --> 01:36:37.755
Okay, okay. Before you get too
excited, here's the deal,

01:36:37.917 --> 01:36:41.046
When it comes to Phillip screwing up,
like he will...

01:36:41.212 --> 01:36:43.385
...you and I are partners, 50-50.

01:36:43.548 --> 01:36:46.722
- Okay?
- That is a deal. You got it.

01:36:46.884 --> 01:36:52.857
Have you guys tried this kugel?
It's terrible. Ha-ha-ha.

01:36:53.016 --> 01:36:54.859
Oh, shit, I just
spit in the kugel.

01:36:55.310 --> 01:36:57.790
- I'm gonna live to regret this, aren't I?
- Of course you are.

01:36:57.895 --> 01:37:00.523
Let me out it off the one side.
I'll get you some.

01:38:02.627 --> 01:38:05.130
Slipping away in broad daylight?

01:38:05.296 --> 01:38:07.298
Yeah.

01:38:08.132 --> 01:38:10.635
I just wasn't up to the drama
of a big goodbye, so...

01:38:10.802 --> 01:38:12.475
No, I get it.

01:38:14.722 --> 01:38:16.269
So Paul offered me the job.

01:38:17.141 --> 01:38:18.313
Great.

01:38:18.476 --> 01:38:21.400
I told him I'd mull it over.
You know, consider my options.

01:38:21.562 --> 01:38:22.734
I don't wanna seem too eager.

01:38:24.816 --> 01:38:27.660
- You're an idiot.
- I really am. Heh.

01:38:27.819 --> 01:38:29.446
Come here.

01:38:30.655 --> 01:38:32.578
I'll see you later, little brother.

01:38:33.366 --> 01:38:34.959
Bye.

01:38:35.993 --> 01:38:37.711
Come here.

01:38:39.914 --> 01:38:42.588
Are we doing this
ironically or...?

01:38:42.750 --> 01:38:45.629
- We can tell ourselves that.
- Okay, good.

01:38:52.510 --> 01:38:54.353
Okay, keep in touch.
