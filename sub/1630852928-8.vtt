WEBVTT

00:14.347 --> 00:15.181
Your Highness.

00:17.434 --> 00:18.852
Your Highness asked for me.

00:22.564 --> 00:25.358
Brother. Why are you here?

00:26.151 --> 00:29.821
I was summoned by King Forkbeard,
to take you home to Normandy.

00:31.114 --> 00:32.532
Your Highness, what is this?

00:32.615 --> 00:35.160
The good of the kingdom
requires that I acknowledge

00:35.243 --> 00:39.539
the existing marriage
of Queen Aelfgifu and my son.

00:39.622 --> 00:42.667
Thereby invalidating
your union with Canute

00:42.751 --> 00:45.795
and your position as Queen of England.

00:47.881 --> 00:48.923
No.

00:49.716 --> 00:51.509
I must reach my husband.

00:51.593 --> 00:54.054
Agnarr, I must send word
to Canute in Denmark.

00:54.137 --> 00:55.221
That's not possible.

00:55.305 --> 00:56.848
It is my husband's decision.

00:56.931 --> 00:59.934
But in his absence,
it's my words that is law.

01:00.018 --> 01:02.187
-You're making a mistake.
-Silence.

01:02.270 --> 01:04.481
This is a trap
that will cost your son everything.

01:04.564 --> 01:07.525
-I am sorry, my sister is strong-willed--
-Do not talk for me.

01:07.609 --> 01:09.819
I will talk to you or for you
however I wish.

01:09.903 --> 01:10.945
Not in my country.

01:11.029 --> 01:16.493
This… is no longer your country.

01:18.036 --> 01:20.080
No. No, this is my home.

01:20.163 --> 01:22.665
Please, you must trust me.

01:44.729 --> 01:46.731


02:16.719 --> 02:18.012
Harald Sigurdsson.

02:19.973 --> 02:21.891
I have heard much about you.

02:22.517 --> 02:26.813
And I you, Jarl Kåre,
"Murderer of Innocents."

02:32.527 --> 02:35.280
Brothers, there is no need for animosity.

02:36.030 --> 02:37.991
The tent of Christ has room for all.

02:39.534 --> 02:43.413
My brother brings information
from Kattegat that might help our quest.

02:44.247 --> 02:45.874
We do not need his help.

02:45.957 --> 02:47.125
I disagree.

02:48.835 --> 02:51.129
Kattegat is not Uppsala.

02:52.547 --> 02:58.303
It is not filled with unarmed pilgrims,
but warriors who are waiting for you.

03:00.263 --> 03:04.851
You would be wise to listen
to all voices trying to help your cause.

03:16.321 --> 03:17.697
I cannot find Harald.

03:17.780 --> 03:19.240
Have you seen him?

03:20.074 --> 03:21.075
No.

03:21.159 --> 03:23.870
Maybe he left
to spy on Kåre's forces.

03:24.954 --> 03:26.331
Why would he not tell me?

03:26.414 --> 03:29.626
He'll be back. You should trust him.

03:53.107 --> 03:54.567
Now I've done what we agreed.

03:57.862 --> 03:59.322
Where is Canute's fleet?

04:00.823 --> 04:02.825
Our agreement did not grant you access,

04:03.493 --> 04:05.995
only the promise
that it would not aid your foes.

04:16.047 --> 04:17.340
Your Highness sent for me?

04:17.924 --> 04:19.592
-You may leave.
-Milady.

04:31.020 --> 04:34.482
Emma is gone, but I do not
have the trust of King Forkbeard.

04:35.066 --> 04:37.568
He is yet to come to terms
with his decision, Your Highness.

04:38.486 --> 04:39.904
What decision?

04:40.530 --> 04:43.199
I'm the mother of his grandsons
and the true queen of England.

04:43.283 --> 04:45.034
Yes, but to gain his respect,

04:45.118 --> 04:47.078
you must present yourself
not as an adversary

04:47.161 --> 04:48.871
who has forced him to give up something,

04:48.955 --> 04:51.416
but as one who can
add value to the kingdom.

04:51.499 --> 04:52.333
Such as?

04:52.917 --> 04:53.876
An ally

04:54.585 --> 04:56.963
in his son's quest to rule England.

05:01.968 --> 05:05.513
I am a daughter of the House of Mercia.
They trust me.

05:05.596 --> 05:06.764
Allow me to go to Tamworth

05:06.848 --> 05:09.475
and persuade their leaders
to give their full support to you.

05:10.101 --> 05:11.728
I've defeated Mercia twice.

05:12.603 --> 05:15.106
My son killed their leader,
their Ealdormen fear me.

05:15.189 --> 05:17.025
Why is Mercia important?

05:17.817 --> 05:20.445
While you have handled Mercia
well in the past, Your Highness,

05:20.528 --> 05:22.196
it still presents a very real danger.

05:22.280 --> 05:26.034
Its army is strong and it is the least
controllable of all the English shires.

05:27.577 --> 05:29.245
The Queen's plan is a good one.

05:29.329 --> 05:32.290
My people are proud and stubborn.

05:33.583 --> 05:35.126
You should know that by now.

05:35.793 --> 05:37.754
Let me help you bring them in line.

05:38.796 --> 05:40.590
Allow me to prove my worth to you.

05:42.759 --> 05:43.885
You may try.

05:45.511 --> 05:47.055
But take Godwin with you.

05:49.766 --> 05:51.893
And don't be too certain of success.

05:56.147 --> 05:59.400
You have gambled much
on the whims of a crazy man.

06:00.193 --> 06:02.945
He's only slightly crazier than us.

06:03.029 --> 06:07.408
He talks at night to that cage
he believes is occupied by a Pagan seer.

06:08.701 --> 06:11.204
And he's obsessed
with Leif Eriksson's sister.

06:12.163 --> 06:14.582
Freydis? Why?

06:14.665 --> 06:15.958
He will not say.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.877
But it is clear she haunts him.

06:18.669 --> 06:22.173
He will not rest until she's dead.
Does that bother you?

06:23.257 --> 06:25.259
-Why should it bother me?
-Come, brother.

06:25.343 --> 06:27.303
I know she shares your bed.

06:28.304 --> 06:32.642
Just as I know about your deal with Canute
to take the throne of Norway from me.

06:36.521 --> 06:38.689
Your betrayal is no secret.

06:39.440 --> 06:40.733
Question is,

06:41.442 --> 06:45.029
did you become impatient or just greedy?

06:50.159 --> 06:52.453
When I promised you my support years ago,

06:53.704 --> 06:55.790
just before you started
slaughtering pagans,

06:56.541 --> 06:58.459
inciting civil war.

06:59.544 --> 07:03.965
Olaf, I felt if I waited
for my time to be king,

07:04.882 --> 07:06.968
there will be no Norway left to rule.

07:07.051 --> 07:09.846
You are too idealistic to be king, Harald.

07:10.430 --> 07:13.141
You think everything
can be solved with words.

07:13.224 --> 07:15.643
Sometimes you just have to go and take it.

07:15.726 --> 07:19.313
You really think what you're doing here
will not draw Canute's anger?

07:19.397 --> 07:22.024
I'm sure he will not like it,

07:22.108 --> 07:25.069
but there is nothing he
or his family can do to stop it.

07:25.778 --> 07:28.531
He's locked in a war in Denmark
and I have hobbled his fleet.

07:29.407 --> 07:32.326
Even if he had the men to spare,
he has no ships to do so.

07:32.410 --> 07:33.786
And by the time he does,

07:34.370 --> 07:38.541
I will have consolidated
all of Norway to defeat him.

07:38.624 --> 07:42.128
Now what I need to know is,
what side are you on?

07:43.171 --> 07:44.088
I'm here.

07:46.299 --> 07:49.051
I've made the decision
to fight with my brother.

08:28.841 --> 08:30.676
Kattegat is in peril.

08:31.511 --> 08:32.887
An enemy surrounds us.

08:33.638 --> 08:35.723
We call out to the Gods for help.

08:36.974 --> 08:39.769
State your name
that the Gods may know you.

08:39.852 --> 08:41.437
My name is Audun.

08:42.480 --> 08:46.025
The Gods will whisper the name Audun

08:46.108 --> 08:50.321
among themselves in the halls of Valhalla.

09:14.595 --> 09:17.848
Your courage is our courage.

09:19.350 --> 09:21.519
Take our prayers with you.

09:24.105 --> 09:25.982
You are the messenger.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.360
Your journey has started.

09:40.705 --> 09:44.542
May Odin and Freya
look upon this sacrifice

09:45.126 --> 09:48.129
and acknowledge Kattegat's loyalty.

10:25.041 --> 10:29.420
The Gods invite us
to make ourselves strong for battle.

10:46.187 --> 10:48.064
You have more men than I thought.

10:48.147 --> 10:52.318
Now do you understand why I care
nothing about your knowledge of Kattegat?

10:53.110 --> 10:55.905
God has answered my prayers with many men.

10:56.739 --> 11:00.660
Gathered to cleanse the heathen scourge
and help begin anew in Christ.

11:00.743 --> 11:02.745
But there are Christians in Kattegat.

11:03.871 --> 11:05.122
What about them?

11:05.790 --> 11:07.958
Their sacrifice
will be accepted in heaven.

11:09.710 --> 11:11.962
If you're so confident
of victory, Jarl Kåre,

11:12.046 --> 11:13.422
why do you delay your attack?

11:13.964 --> 11:17.426
Well, it's not me we are waiting on,
it is your brother.

11:29.271 --> 11:33.025
Friends, I've made you wait for battle,

11:33.109 --> 11:36.153
but now God will reward you
for your patience.

11:36.737 --> 11:40.741
The walls of Kattegat
have not been breached in over 100 years.

11:40.825 --> 11:44.704
Are the walls higher than other walls? No.

11:45.705 --> 11:49.625
Is the wood
they are built from magical? No.

11:49.709 --> 11:52.128
It is because Kattegat is blessed

11:52.211 --> 11:54.880
with a harbor
which protects it from invasion.

11:54.964 --> 11:59.009
Not even high tides allow ships to get
close enough to unload the men safely.

11:59.093 --> 12:02.805
Therefore, any attacks
must be directed against the main walls,

12:02.888 --> 12:04.974
where they can focus all their warriors.

12:06.851 --> 12:07.893
Until now.

12:08.686 --> 12:12.398
In two days, there will be a wolf moon,

12:14.108 --> 12:17.278
and the tide it brings with it will swell.

12:18.195 --> 12:22.742
Allowing my ships
to not only sail over their defenses,

12:23.743 --> 12:26.078
but land warriors on their beaches.

12:26.829 --> 12:28.914
We will enter Kattegat from the sea

12:30.416 --> 12:33.586
and crush it between two great forces.

12:34.712 --> 12:38.549
And that is why you are
a great Sea Wolf, Olaf Haraldsson.

12:43.137 --> 12:46.307
Jarl Sölvi, Jarl Ögmundr,

12:47.475 --> 12:51.270
God has chosen your armies
for the first attack.

12:51.353 --> 12:53.647
Brother, may I speak?

12:54.857 --> 12:56.025
Of course.

12:58.778 --> 13:01.572
Jarl Kåre, when I joined you,

13:01.655 --> 13:04.033
I had my doubts
about your chances for success.

13:05.367 --> 13:07.453
But now that I've witnessed
with my own eyes

13:07.536 --> 13:10.623
the strength of your armies
and the intelligence of your plan,

13:11.248 --> 13:13.083
I'm convinced of your victory.

13:13.167 --> 13:16.796
Oh. It is God's victory.

13:16.879 --> 13:19.298
No, not God's.

13:19.381 --> 13:21.175
He would not sanction this.

13:21.258 --> 13:23.427
-Heretic!
-He's not a believer.

13:23.511 --> 13:25.179
Our Savior Jesus said,

13:25.971 --> 13:26.889
"Woe to you,

13:27.723 --> 13:30.893
who shut off the Kingdom of Heaven
from those who seek it."

13:30.976 --> 13:33.437
"For it will be you, not them,

13:34.355 --> 13:36.482
who will be barred
on the day of judgment."

13:37.191 --> 13:39.610
Instead of leading
us to heaven, Jarl Kåre,

13:39.693 --> 13:42.947
I believe your passion for revenge
will condemn us to hell.

13:44.198 --> 13:45.574
There is an answer, though.

13:46.909 --> 13:48.327
Allow me to lead a parley.

13:49.912 --> 13:52.790
Give me the opportunity
to persuade Jarl Haakon

13:52.873 --> 13:55.042
to surrender Kattegat peacefully.

13:55.626 --> 13:57.545
To allow a conversion.

13:59.505 --> 14:00.589
If she agrees,

14:01.465 --> 14:04.802
you will have your victory,
both here and in heaven.

14:05.511 --> 14:07.096
And when she refuses?

14:07.763 --> 14:10.224
Then the blood
on our hands will be untainted

14:11.225 --> 14:14.144
and our actions forgiven
on the day of judgement.

14:27.950 --> 14:30.327
I do not trust you.

14:32.621 --> 14:35.916
That is why we should do this… together.

15:10.784 --> 15:12.036
Shield-maiden?

15:13.370 --> 15:14.830
You've come a long way, girl.

15:15.456 --> 15:17.625
And you are still a murderer.

15:20.794 --> 15:22.087
What are you doing here?

15:23.505 --> 15:24.798
Seeking peace.

15:24.882 --> 15:27.551
-Greenlander.
-Jarl Olaf.

15:27.635 --> 15:30.971
Jarl Haakon, thank you
for agreeing to parley.

15:31.805 --> 15:36.602
I seek to broker a peace and have brought
my brother Jarl Olaf and Jarl Kåre,

15:37.686 --> 15:39.563
so that you may hear their proposal.

15:40.856 --> 15:41.899
I'm listening.

15:42.441 --> 15:47.738
As you know, we have brought the armies
of the Christian clans to your walls.

15:47.821 --> 15:50.699
But we are here
to offer Kattegat salvation,

15:50.783 --> 15:52.910
both immediate and everlasting.

15:53.994 --> 15:56.872
If your people agree
to the sacrament of baptism

15:56.956 --> 15:59.458
and willingly renounce their Pagan past,

15:59.541 --> 16:01.251
we are willing to spare your city

16:02.294 --> 16:05.631
and welcome you
to the brotherhood of Christ.

16:07.216 --> 16:10.386
Kattegat is more than my city, Jarl Olaf.

16:11.053 --> 16:15.808
For as long as snow has fallen,
my people have worshipped the same Gods.

16:15.891 --> 16:18.560
Gods your family once knew.

16:18.644 --> 16:20.980
They walk among us on Earth.

16:21.063 --> 16:23.190
They bring us joy and give us courage.

16:23.774 --> 16:26.944
They fail and remind us of our humanity.

16:28.487 --> 16:30.614
My people do not fear death.

16:30.698 --> 16:33.033
They know if they fight
till their last breath,

16:33.951 --> 16:36.286
they will have earned
a seat at Odin's table.

16:37.621 --> 16:39.081
We all die, Olaf.

16:39.707 --> 16:42.751
If my people die in this war
you have brought to my door,

16:42.835 --> 16:45.713
they die with honor, not shame.

16:48.382 --> 16:50.592
I told you this was a waste of time.

16:51.844 --> 16:53.637
Then may God's will be done.

16:57.850 --> 16:59.601
Thank you for trying, Prince Harald.

17:02.187 --> 17:04.356
Friend, think clearly.

17:05.774 --> 17:09.111
Woe betide you go to your fate
as Njal and Skarde did,

17:09.194 --> 17:10.446
consumed by fire.

17:11.447 --> 17:13.449
Look to the heavens and the sea

17:14.700 --> 17:17.036
to know where your salvation lies.

17:20.164 --> 17:21.415
You've made your case.

17:22.916 --> 17:24.501
Now return to your madman.

17:29.298 --> 17:31.550
You promised you would
never fight against us.

17:32.926 --> 17:34.928
I see now what your love is worth.

17:46.356 --> 17:47.649
Who is the girl to you?

17:48.317 --> 17:49.693
She is nothing.

17:50.861 --> 17:52.988
Just a Pagan I slept with.

17:56.658 --> 17:58.619
Hyah!

18:02.623 --> 18:04.124
-Watch him.
-Hmm.

18:06.710 --> 18:09.755
I cannot believe he would
darken the memory of Njal and Skarde.

18:10.422 --> 18:12.716
Njal and Skarde
didn't die by fire, Freydis.

18:13.675 --> 18:15.677
Harald just told us
how they plan to attack.

18:15.761 --> 18:19.473
We know how they will attack.
Their army is in front of us.

18:19.556 --> 18:21.517
But Olaf intends
to invade Kattegat by sea.

18:21.600 --> 18:22.935
Not possible.

18:23.018 --> 18:25.437
He cannot get ships close enough to shore.

18:25.521 --> 18:27.981
He can on a wolf moon at a high tide.

18:28.065 --> 18:29.149
Which is in two days.

18:29.858 --> 18:31.485
We must move quickly to prepare.

18:38.492 --> 18:41.078
Mercia is not happy with the Viking king

18:41.161 --> 18:42.329
or his father.

18:42.412 --> 18:45.332
You were not happy with a Saxon king.
You were never happy.

18:47.292 --> 18:51.505
Mercia's problem has never been
whether its ruler was a Saxon or Viking,

18:51.588 --> 18:53.590
it's that they had a ruler at all.

18:54.341 --> 18:55.968
Mercia wants independence.

18:56.635 --> 18:58.971
I know that. I grew up here.

19:00.848 --> 19:03.517
You will not achieve this freedom
by resisting London.

19:03.600 --> 19:07.479
It did not work with Eadric Streona,
and it will not work with you.

19:08.605 --> 19:11.483
What you need
is a strong advocate in court,

19:12.109 --> 19:16.113
one who understands the intimate needs
of both Mercia and Canute.

19:18.157 --> 19:19.449
What you need is me.

19:47.436 --> 19:49.813
What is wrong? You're troubled.

19:50.439 --> 19:51.398
It's nothing.

19:53.942 --> 19:56.111
No. Talk to me.

19:57.905 --> 19:59.948
Jarl Haakon is fighting for her people.

20:01.491 --> 20:03.285
Freydis, for her Gods.

20:03.368 --> 20:05.996
Even Kåre and Olaf are here
for what they think is right.

20:06.079 --> 20:07.873
And you are fighting for us.

20:08.624 --> 20:10.167
For these people.

20:12.252 --> 20:13.670
For our future.

20:16.465 --> 20:17.716
That is important.

20:22.679 --> 20:23.639
Enter.

20:27.226 --> 20:29.895
I wished only to say
congratulations, Your Highness.

20:30.646 --> 20:33.106
You've secured an agreement with Mercia,

20:33.190 --> 20:35.567
which neither King Æthelred
nor Emma could achieve.

20:36.652 --> 20:38.987
I have made arrangements
for our departure tomorrow.

20:39.071 --> 20:41.365
Please, stay for a moment.

20:42.658 --> 20:43.825
Yes, Your Highness?

20:44.409 --> 20:45.661
Share some wine with me.

20:49.915 --> 20:52.459
Now is the time for your service.

20:52.542 --> 20:55.837
All will be watching you,
following your actions.

20:56.713 --> 20:58.966
You are the guardians of Kattegat,

20:59.049 --> 21:00.759
keepers of the faith.

21:00.842 --> 21:03.762
If we die, so do our Gods.

21:03.845 --> 21:05.555
They become memories.

21:06.431 --> 21:07.975
You will not fail them

21:08.684 --> 21:10.936
if you do not fail yourselves.

21:11.645 --> 21:14.648
-We will not.
-We will not fail.

22:00.402 --> 22:01.862
Light the beacon.

22:21.006 --> 22:22.049
Prepare!

23:15.894 --> 23:17.479
Wait for my signal!

23:25.946 --> 23:27.280
Load the trebuchets!

23:39.960 --> 23:42.170
Here they come!

23:42.838 --> 23:43.839
Ready!

23:44.881 --> 23:50.137
And then… God's glory was revealed.

23:56.601 --> 23:58.311
Archers!

24:02.107 --> 24:03.150
Loose!

24:06.987 --> 24:08.321
Loose!

24:29.718 --> 24:31.970
Nothing can stop the will of the Lord.

24:33.013 --> 24:34.222
Including you.

24:36.141 --> 24:37.851
Stop!

24:37.934 --> 24:41.771
I will bring you back
Freydis' head as a memento.

24:52.824 --> 24:54.201
Fall back!

24:56.077 --> 24:57.621
Fall back!

24:57.704 --> 24:59.331
Open the gate!

25:01.666 --> 25:03.752
Fall back!

25:22.312 --> 25:23.396
Close it!

25:29.361 --> 25:30.278
Loose!

26:18.493 --> 26:19.411
Loose!

26:36.595 --> 26:37.804
Something's wrong.

26:37.887 --> 26:39.514
They are frightened to attack.

26:39.598 --> 26:40.432
No.

26:42.100 --> 26:43.977
There is no army on those ships.

26:47.439 --> 26:50.191
It's a trick. They're not attacking here.

26:51.318 --> 26:52.569
Pull back!

26:53.236 --> 26:55.530
Pull back to Kattegat wall!

26:55.614 --> 26:58.908
Fall back! Fall back!

27:11.713 --> 27:12.922
You used Kåre.

27:13.715 --> 27:15.884
You said it yourself, he's a madman.

27:16.551 --> 27:19.346
Why waste men to a battle
when someone else will?

27:19.429 --> 27:20.722
He and the other Jarls

27:20.805 --> 27:23.933
will make it through the gates
and destroy Haakon's forces.

27:24.017 --> 27:25.602
By the time my army arrives,

27:25.685 --> 27:29.314
I will be the strongest Jarl
left in Norway. Maybe the only one.

27:31.691 --> 27:33.985
You used me to split Kattegat's forces.

27:34.069 --> 27:36.529
Kattegat was too strong
to defeat otherwise.

27:37.238 --> 27:40.825
I knew you wouldn't abandon
Freydis or Leif for me.

27:45.205 --> 27:46.039
Hyah!

27:59.552 --> 28:02.138
Over the wall!

28:04.808 --> 28:06.434
Kill them all!

28:08.228 --> 28:12.315
Get the ladders!

28:24.119 --> 28:25.954
-Take your ladder!

28:29.833 --> 28:31.167
There she is!

28:32.711 --> 28:36.339
Archers! Shoot for that tower!

28:43.263 --> 28:44.639
Yes!

28:44.723 --> 28:46.224
Jarl Haakon!

28:47.934 --> 28:49.686
Get her to safety.

28:51.187 --> 28:52.856
Freydis! Help her!

28:54.482 --> 28:55.692
Move!

28:59.070 --> 29:01.030
Take her away now!

29:01.114 --> 29:02.365
Push!

29:52.248 --> 29:53.625
The ladders!

30:09.057 --> 30:10.183
Lift it! Lift!

30:40.421 --> 30:44.425
Get out of the way!

31:38.563 --> 31:40.648
Freydis…

31:46.195 --> 31:47.280
Freydis.

31:48.615 --> 31:50.992
Whatever happens,

31:52.785 --> 31:56.372
you must… survive.

32:00.293 --> 32:03.922
You are The Last.

32:35.244 --> 32:36.245
Leave us.

32:45.129 --> 32:46.756
It is time to end this.

34:45.083 --> 34:48.002
The cross that carries the sword
was never you.

34:53.674 --> 34:57.011
It was <i>my</i> destiny.

35:05.770 --> 35:07.605
No.

35:13.820 --> 35:15.071
No.

36:01.868 --> 36:02.743
No!

36:02.827 --> 36:04.662
To the Great Hall!

36:06.831 --> 36:09.542
-Hallbjorn, with me!
-To the Great Hall!

36:14.505 --> 36:15.965
Head to the hall!

36:31.939 --> 36:33.608
No, no.

36:33.691 --> 36:35.610
No, no, no.
I need you to be strong for me.

36:42.450 --> 36:44.493
Come on. Stay with me.
Look at me, look at me, look at me.

36:44.577 --> 36:45.411
No, Leif.

36:46.621 --> 36:47.955
-Hey.

36:50.416 --> 36:53.044
-I'm going to Valhalla.
-No, you're staying with me.

36:53.127 --> 36:55.504
-No, Leif. Leif…
-Hey, no.

36:55.588 --> 36:59.300
I need you to tell me
that you'll join me there.

36:59.383 --> 37:01.010
-No, no.
-Join me there.

37:02.845 --> 37:05.014
Tell me… Tell me you believe.

37:05.097 --> 37:08.684
No. You're going to be fine.
You'll be fine.

37:10.186 --> 37:11.854
That's not what I asked.

37:19.654 --> 37:22.156
No. No. Liv!

37:22.240 --> 37:25.910
No, no, no. Liv. Liv, I'll join you.

37:27.245 --> 37:30.122
I'll join you. I'll join you,
I promise. I promise.

37:33.000 --> 37:34.377
I promise.

38:44.488 --> 38:46.365
We must go. Get up.

38:53.080 --> 38:54.457
Here. It's okay. This one.

39:06.177 --> 39:07.970
Get him out of my hall!

39:08.596 --> 39:09.764
Do it. Now.

39:15.936 --> 39:18.522
Kattegat is ours!

39:18.606 --> 39:21.442
Kattegat is ours!

39:25.738 --> 39:27.198
Yes!

39:28.699 --> 39:31.660
King Olaf of Norway!

39:33.329 --> 39:35.081
King Olaf!

39:49.387 --> 39:51.722
Freydis, it's over.

39:53.599 --> 39:54.850
We must go.

39:55.810 --> 39:56.727
Hey!

40:14.370 --> 40:15.496
Welcome back, Your Highness.

40:15.579 --> 40:17.748
I bring news of Mercia for King Forkbeard.

40:19.834 --> 40:22.920
King Forkbeard, I bring excellent news.

40:23.003 --> 40:24.463
Mercia is yours.

40:29.385 --> 40:31.262
Why are you not in Normandy?

40:31.345 --> 40:32.930
It didn't suit me.

40:33.514 --> 40:34.640
Remove her.

40:36.225 --> 40:37.935
I command it in the name of the King.

40:38.018 --> 40:39.854
You command nothing
in the name of the King.

40:41.105 --> 40:43.524
King Forkbeard banished you.

40:43.607 --> 40:46.110
No. He needed time to find his fleet,

40:47.027 --> 40:50.114
which my charade
and your trip to Mercia provided him.

40:53.492 --> 40:54.410
You.

40:55.786 --> 40:57.413
You were part of this.

40:57.955 --> 40:59.248
Indeed, I was.

41:01.125 --> 41:02.293
You called me "Queen."

41:03.169 --> 41:04.879
You are a queen, Your Highness.

41:04.962 --> 41:06.672
Just not England's queen.

41:13.762 --> 41:14.889
Where is he?

41:16.140 --> 41:17.641
Where is Forkbeard?

41:17.725 --> 41:19.143
Where he should be.

41:19.810 --> 41:21.645
With his ships and his grandsons.

41:37.703 --> 41:39.872
Let this be your first lesson.

41:40.998 --> 41:43.751
Never let traitors go unpunished.

41:44.502 --> 41:46.962
Death to all traitors!

42:03.354 --> 42:06.565
Ships are coming!

42:08.442 --> 42:09.527
Hundreds of them.

42:11.529 --> 42:12.905
Ships are coming!

42:12.988 --> 42:14.657
No!

42:16.867 --> 42:19.912
-King Forkbeard's fleet.
-No.

42:23.624 --> 42:25.000
It's not possible.

42:28.128 --> 42:29.255
No.

42:30.756 --> 42:32.925
No!

42:33.008 --> 42:34.677
-Stop. No.

42:36.971 --> 42:38.222
Stop! No!

42:38.764 --> 42:40.349
No, we must attack!

42:41.100 --> 42:43.519
Don't run. Stay and fight!

42:52.736 --> 42:54.405
No. Hallbjorn.

43:28.897 --> 43:30.357
Get out!

43:30.441 --> 43:33.235
-No!

43:34.570 --> 43:35.487
Hold her down!

43:35.571 --> 43:37.281
-No!
