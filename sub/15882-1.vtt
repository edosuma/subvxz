18:58.094 --> 19:00.596
we once again urge you
to discontinue

19:00.722 --> 19:02.264
your uranium enrichment program.

19:02.390 --> 19:04.058
- Hey, Mahmoud?
Kim Jong?

19:04.184 --> 19:06.018
I think I already
done told both y'all,

19:06.144 --> 19:07.895
86 your shit, bitches,

19:08.021 --> 19:10.606
or I'm going to come over there
and do it for y'all.

19:10.732 --> 19:13.025
Please test me
and see what happens.

19:13.151 --> 19:17.029
- On the domestic front, I just
want to say to my critics,

19:17.155 --> 19:20.032
I hear your voices and
I'm aware of your concerns.

19:20.158 --> 19:21.575
- So maybe if you could
chill the hell out

19:21.701 --> 19:23.327
for, like, a second,
then maybe I could focus

19:23.453 --> 19:25.412
on some shit, you know?

19:25.539 --> 19:26.789
- And that goes for everybody,

19:26.915 --> 19:28.541
including members
of the Tea Party.

19:28.667 --> 19:29.708
- Oh, don't even get me started
on these motherfuckers

19:29.835 --> 19:31.168
right here.

19:31.294 --> 19:32.962
- I want to assure you
that we will be looking

19:33.088 --> 19:36.131
for new compromises with
the GOP in the months ahead.

19:36.258 --> 19:37.508
- And you know these
motherfuckers gonna say no

19:37.634 --> 19:39.426
before I even suggest
some shit.

19:39.553 --> 19:43.806
- Now I know a lot of folks say
that I haven't done a good job

19:43.932 --> 19:46.642
at communicating my
accomplishments to the public.

19:46.768 --> 19:49.311
- Because y'all
motherfuckers don't listen!

19:49.437 --> 19:52.064
- Uh, since being in office,

19:52.190 --> 19:54.149
we've created
3 million new jobs.

19:54.276 --> 19:56.151
- 3 million new jobs.

19:56.278 --> 19:58.237
- We ended the war in Iraq.
- Ended a war, y'all.

19:58.363 --> 20:00.322
We ended a war,
remember that?

20:00.448 --> 20:02.783
- These achievements
should serve as a reminder

20:02.909 --> 20:04.285
that I am on your side.

20:04.411 --> 20:06.745
[Feedback squeals]
- I am not a Muslim!

20:06.872 --> 20:09.039
- And that my intentions,
as your president,

20:09.165 --> 20:11.458
are coming from
the right place.

20:11.585 --> 20:13.502
- They coming from Hawaii,
which is where I'm from,

20:13.628 --> 20:15.504
which is in the United States
of America, y'all.

20:15.630 --> 20:17.590
Okay?
This is ridiculous.

20:17.716 --> 20:21.010
I have a birth certificate!
I have a birth certificate!

20:21.136 --> 20:23.721
I have a hot,
diggity-doggity,

20:23.847 --> 20:25.931
mamase mamasa mamakusa,
birth certificate,

20:26.057 --> 20:27.433
you dumbass crackers!

20:27.559 --> 20:30.060
- Okay, Luther.
Rope it in.

20:30.186 --> 20:31.562
- Yeah, dial it back, Luther.
Damn.

20:31.688 --> 20:34.398
- In conclusion,
last night I had

20:34.524 --> 20:35.566
a conversation
with Michelle.

20:35.692 --> 20:37.151
- I says, "Bitch."

20:37.277 --> 20:38.319
- Nope,
I did not say that.

20:38.445 --> 20:40.821
I did not say that.

20:43.158 --> 20:45.784
- So, uh, we are going to be
saying good night right now,

20:45.911 --> 20:48.120
but before we do,
I just want say that we are...

20:48.246 --> 20:50.748
I do think we're lucky.

20:50.874 --> 20:52.499
In the lottery of life,
I think we are lucky

20:52.626 --> 20:55.127
to have gotten
the best quality of both races.

20:55.253 --> 20:57.129
- I think so too.
- That we are a part of.

20:57.255 --> 20:58.547
No, it is.
- I think so too.

20:58.673 --> 21:00.424
- No, because I know
there are two dudes

21:00.550 --> 21:02.718
out there somewhere right now
with little dicks

21:02.844 --> 21:05.596
and sickle cell.
- Yeah, it's true.

21:05.722 --> 21:08.807
Good night.
- Thank you.

21:13.271 --> 21:16.148
- ♪ I'm gonna do
my one line here ♪

21:16.274 --> 21:18.275
- Oh, yeah.

21:21.279 --> 21:22.738
- When did Asian guys
become fucking cool?

21:22.864 --> 21:24.823
I don't understand that.

21:24.950 --> 21:27.785
Y'all stole break dancing.
- When did that happen?

21:27.911 --> 21:29.370
I just figured
you would know...

21:29.496 --> 21:31.163
you don't know the answer?
- It's not fair.

21:31.289 --> 21:32.998
- They just straight up
stole it.

21:33.124 --> 21:35.292
- "Y'all been trying to perfect
this art?" Backflips.
