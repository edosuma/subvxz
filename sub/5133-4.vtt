00:11.406 --> 00:12.807
Previously on Power...

00:12.874 --> 00:15.810
Ghost! We need to talk.

00:15.877 --> 00:17.944
This club is the dream.

00:18.012 --> 00:20.681
I don't know any old,
wrinkled drug dealers.

00:20.748 --> 00:22.349
They're either dead or inside.

00:22.417 --> 00:25.185
They're not as good as you.

00:25.253 --> 00:26.786
Retail side's been locked up tight

00:26.854 --> 00:28.388
since we sent those body parts around town.

00:28.456 --> 00:30.290
You hire this motherfucker
to boost my product?

00:30.358 --> 00:32.092
Fuck, no, I've never seen him before.

00:32.159 --> 00:34.891
Anibal Santalises.

00:36.396 --> 00:37.231
You want a ride home?

00:37.299 --> 00:40.100
When was the last time you
asked a girl out on a real date?

00:40.167 --> 00:41.801
Do you even know how?

00:41.869 --> 00:44.204
My boss told me not to get distracted.

00:44.271 --> 00:47.673
But somehow when it comes to you...

I don't give a fuck what Anibal said.

03:29.331 --> 03:31.065
He's behind these hits.

03:31.133 --> 03:33.334
Right now the retail business
is all we got running.

03:33.402 --> 03:35.969
We both know that shit alone
is not paying the bills.

03:36.037 --> 03:37.905
We need to light Anibal's ass up

03:37.972 --> 03:40.508
and turn this fucking tap back on.

03:40.575 --> 03:42.543
Anibal has always been a person

03:42.611 --> 03:44.177
who likes the status quo.

03:44.245 --> 03:45.880
I don't see him making a move like that.

03:45.947 --> 03:47.515
He's too fucking lazy.

03:47.582 --> 03:49.049
It's just as possible
somebody's setting him up.

03:49.117 --> 03:51.118
You over-think everything, man.

03:51.185 --> 03:52.920
We burnt the shit out of that kid,

03:52.987 --> 03:54.854
and he told us that
fatboy gave him the job.

03:54.923 --> 03:56.423
Case closed for me.

03:56.490 --> 03:58.491
Kanan would've had this
motherfucker toe up already.

03:58.559 --> 04:01.861
Yeah, and I ain't fucking Kanan.

04:01.930 --> 04:04.331
We're having this sit-down
in a couple of days.

04:04.399 --> 04:06.199
We kept 'em all dry for a minute now.

04:06.267 --> 04:07.801
The motherfucker who ain't thirsty

04:07.868 --> 04:09.302
is the one hitting us.

04:09.369 --> 04:11.170
We'll know for sure who's behind this shit

04:11.238 --> 04:13.840
when we're across a table
staring them all in the eye.

04:13.908 --> 04:16.843
What if it ain't one of them?

04:18.879 --> 04:20.579
I mean...

04:20.648 --> 04:24.016
you ever think Lobos might be
the one behind all this shit?

04:24.084 --> 04:27.186
Every damn day.

04:27.254 --> 04:29.588
But I can't figure out why he'd do it,

04:29.656 --> 04:32.191
why he wouldn't have had us capped already.

04:32.259 --> 04:35.194
So until I got good answers
to those fucking questions,

04:35.262 --> 04:39.231
I gotta assume Lobos ain't involved.

04:39.299 --> 04:41.032
We'll compare notes after this meeting

04:41.100 --> 04:43.335
- and see where we end up.
- All right.

04:43.402 --> 04:47.506
We're gonna find out who's fucking with us.

04:47.574 --> 04:49.541
And then we're gonna kill 'em.

04:49.609 --> 04:51.176
Hmm.

04:56.215 --> 04:58.850
There's my baby girl! Hey, come here!

04:58.917 --> 05:00.518
Aww.

05:00.586 --> 05:02.120
Yo, what's up, "T"?

05:02.188 --> 05:04.990
- Go say hey to Uncle Tommy.
- Come here.

05:05.057 --> 05:06.358
Where you been?

05:06.425 --> 05:08.293
Out... with 'Keisha.

05:08.361 --> 05:09.927
- 'Keisha.
- What?

05:09.996 --> 05:11.396
Mm.

05:11.464 --> 05:12.998
Leave her alone. You know that's my friend.

05:13.065 --> 05:14.431
Mm-hmm, your friend that has everything

05:14.500 --> 05:16.233
to say about everything.

05:16.301 --> 05:18.035
Yas doing all right after
that thing the other night?

05:18.103 --> 05:20.104
Yas has forgotten about it, of course.

05:20.171 --> 05:23.173
I can't get it out of my head.

05:23.241 --> 05:25.242
She was just fine, and then, boom. Yeah?

05:25.310 --> 05:27.845
That's how things happen.

05:27.913 --> 05:30.080
Your whole life can change in one breath.

05:30.148 --> 05:31.848
I'm still trying to figure out

05:31.916 --> 05:34.351
where she got the keychain
from in the first place.

05:34.419 --> 05:36.320
You know, I'm gonna talk
to the housekeeper about it.

05:36.388 --> 05:40.224
- It don't matter now, right?
- Right.

05:40.291 --> 05:42.292
Count our blessings while we have 'em.

05:46.197 --> 05:49.399
Hey! Cynthia's here to talk
about the Sutton Place Party.

05:49.466 --> 05:51.401
- Cool, where is she?
- She's in your office.

05:51.468 --> 05:53.637
Now don't give away the store
to get this party, all right?

05:53.704 --> 05:55.939
Offer her a good deal, not a great one.

05:56.007 --> 05:57.240
- Mm.
- Should I come with?

05:57.307 --> 05:58.909
I got this.

06:03.380 --> 06:05.481
I got us 8:00 reservations
at that Italian spot

06:05.549 --> 06:07.983
at 7th and the Park.

06:08.052 --> 06:09.552
You haven't heard the word
"No" very often in your life,

06:09.619 --> 06:11.154
have you?

06:11.221 --> 06:13.156
I hear it all the time, I just ignore it.

06:13.223 --> 06:15.124
You have to find another date.

06:15.192 --> 06:17.560
Maybe there's some girls getting
off their shift at Cheetah's.

06:17.627 --> 06:20.996
Hey, tell Kantos you feel
sick so we can break out.

06:21.064 --> 06:22.431
I'm working.

06:22.498 --> 06:24.099
And Thursday's one of our busiest nights.

06:24.167 --> 06:25.968
So I don't care if you're Derek Jeter,

06:26.036 --> 06:29.171
I'm not losing out on $1,000
worth of tips for anyone.

06:29.238 --> 06:30.639
Here.

06:30.707 --> 06:33.976
Here's 2,000.

06:34.044 --> 06:36.045
Let's bounce.

06:36.112 --> 06:37.446
I'm not gonna fuck you.

06:37.513 --> 06:40.482
Good to know. Can we go now?

06:45.288 --> 06:47.389
I think I'm coming down with the flu.

06:49.559 --> 06:51.960
That drug overdose the other night

06:52.027 --> 06:53.695
is not the kind of
publicity you want, James.

06:53.762 --> 06:56.230
It wasn't an overdose.
A girl got some bad coke.

06:56.298 --> 06:58.700
- Could happen anywhere.
- But it happened here.

06:58.767 --> 07:02.303
And it's unseemly of us
to partner with a venue

07:02.370 --> 07:04.305
that has a reputation for drug use.

07:04.372 --> 07:06.007
Now one incident's an anomaly,

07:06.075 --> 07:09.176
another one, well...

07:09.244 --> 07:12.045
You should know that my budget
for the Sutton Place Party

07:12.114 --> 07:13.647
has been dramatically trimmed.

07:13.715 --> 07:15.516
But you shouldn't focus on money.

07:15.584 --> 07:17.184
If I have the event here...

07:17.252 --> 07:19.052
Truth will be in every major publication

07:19.121 --> 07:21.288
from the New York Times to China Daily.

07:21.356 --> 07:24.691
That's game-changing publicity
for a new club like yours.

07:24.759 --> 07:28.161
You need this party, trust me.

07:33.601 --> 07:36.169
One party.

07:36.237 --> 07:38.639
It's an anomaly.

07:38.706 --> 07:40.741
Okay, you can have the venue.

07:40.808 --> 07:43.109
All you have to cover is bar and staff.

07:43.177 --> 07:45.178
But I want the rest of
your parties this year...

07:45.246 --> 07:47.313
Tribeca Film, Fashion Week, Hot List.

07:47.381 --> 07:48.681
I want them all.

07:48.749 --> 07:50.150
Okay, unfortunately

07:50.217 --> 07:51.751
those parties are already spoken for.

07:51.818 --> 07:53.653
Fashion Week is at Parley.

07:53.720 --> 07:55.355
Tribeca Film Festival is at Verbatim.

07:55.422 --> 07:57.056
Simon Stern's clubs.

07:57.124 --> 07:58.658
I'm offering you a
better deal than he will.

07:58.725 --> 08:02.061
As you said, your budget's
been "Dramatically Trimmed."

08:06.833 --> 08:08.600
Why don't you go talk to your employers

08:08.669 --> 08:10.269
and get back to me?

08:15.175 --> 08:16.608
That's the kind of person I am.

08:16.676 --> 08:20.145
I don't think first, I just do what I want.

08:20.213 --> 08:23.114
What about you? What
kind of person are you?

08:23.183 --> 08:24.783
- What kind of person am I?
- Yeah.

08:24.850 --> 08:26.385
I don't know, a regular person?

08:26.452 --> 08:28.387
Do you have any hobbies?

08:28.454 --> 08:30.556
I mean, like, what do you for fun?

08:30.623 --> 08:32.157
I don't know. Video games?

08:32.224 --> 08:33.792
What are you, 13?

08:33.859 --> 08:36.727
- Hey, let's grab a drink.
- What about dinner?

08:36.796 --> 08:40.097
Drink now, eat later.

08:42.634 --> 08:44.368
Remember, no one dances on the banquettes.

08:44.436 --> 08:45.603
That blonde bitch last week

08:45.671 --> 08:47.205
cost us 800 bucks in refinishing

08:47.272 --> 08:48.639
because of her fucking Louboutins.

08:48.707 --> 08:50.241
- Headed uptown.
- How'd it go with Cynthia?

08:50.309 --> 08:51.576
Well, I told her all she'd have to do

08:51.643 --> 08:53.211
is cover bar and staff if she'd give us

08:53.278 --> 08:54.512
the rest of her parties this year.

08:54.580 --> 08:55.746
- Boss.
- No, look.

08:55.814 --> 08:57.315
I know we'll lose money.

08:57.382 --> 08:58.683
But hey, if we get those
events, fools will be

08:58.750 --> 09:00.418
cutting blank checks to get up in here.

09:00.485 --> 09:01.785
Look, I get that you're
building for tomorrow,

09:01.853 --> 09:03.554
but we gotta keep the lights on today.

09:03.622 --> 09:06.256
See, short-term thinking
creates short-term results.

09:06.324 --> 09:09.093
Come on.

09:09.160 --> 09:11.195
My first day of sixth grade,

09:11.262 --> 09:13.764
I find the biggest kid in P.S. 142

09:13.832 --> 09:16.200
and bam!

09:16.267 --> 09:19.136
I put him on his ass. Lights out.

09:19.204 --> 09:21.471
Right hand to the motherfucking jaw.

09:21.539 --> 09:24.073
So no one ever messed with you after that?

09:24.141 --> 09:25.475
Are you kidding me?

09:25.543 --> 09:28.278
I was the only white kid for 20 blocks.

09:28.346 --> 09:29.812
I got my ass kicked every day.

09:29.880 --> 09:31.848
But I never gave up.

09:31.915 --> 09:35.084
I never stopped fighting.

09:35.152 --> 09:38.654
Some people are asking for it.

10:00.777 --> 10:02.745
Wow, it looks... looks good on you.

10:04.681 --> 10:06.214
It would look good on anyone.

10:06.283 --> 10:08.884
Not like this.

10:11.553 --> 10:14.156
We went 18 years,

10:14.223 --> 10:16.892
now I feel like I can't
even make it two days.

10:16.959 --> 10:19.227
Yeah, I know.

10:19.295 --> 10:23.631
I needed to see you too.

10:23.699 --> 10:26.501
This... why did you...

10:26.568 --> 10:29.904
I just wanted, you know,
to give you something nice.

10:29.971 --> 10:31.773
Make you feel special.

10:31.840 --> 10:35.242
I feel special when you look at me.

10:35.311 --> 10:37.845
You don't need to buy me anything.

10:40.516 --> 10:42.350
So...

10:42.418 --> 10:44.351
what now?

10:44.419 --> 10:46.687
Are we "Going out"? Is
that what we called it?

10:51.893 --> 10:54.929
My baby daughter almost
died two days ago, Angie.

10:57.365 --> 10:59.433
You... you have a daughter?

10:59.500 --> 11:02.235
I have three kids.

11:02.303 --> 11:03.837
And I have a wife.

11:06.273 --> 11:09.209
I almost lost my baby girl Yasmine.

11:09.276 --> 11:10.811
Yasmine.

11:10.878 --> 11:13.279
And it made me think about you...

11:13.348 --> 11:15.682
and us.

11:15.750 --> 11:18.284
I got no excuse. I should've told you.

11:23.257 --> 11:27.327
I never stopped thinking about you...

11:27.394 --> 11:31.697
all these years.

11:31.765 --> 11:33.266
I can't just ask you...

11:33.334 --> 11:35.934
I have a boyfriend.

11:36.002 --> 11:37.703
Greg.

11:37.771 --> 11:40.272
Greg.

11:40.340 --> 11:42.975
I guess we were just fooling ourselves.

11:43.042 --> 11:44.677
I didn't tell you about Greg

11:44.745 --> 11:46.579
for the same reason you didn't tell me.

11:46.646 --> 11:48.681
I just thought that...

11:48.749 --> 11:51.583
Yeah, me too.

11:51.650 --> 11:54.552
- You should take this.
- No.

11:54.620 --> 11:57.455
You can't give it back.

11:57.523 --> 12:00.492
That's a gift.

12:03.863 --> 12:06.231
When you walked out of my life,

12:06.299 --> 12:10.835
you left ten days before your birthday.

12:13.071 --> 12:16.374
Consider it a belated birthday present.

12:19.311 --> 12:22.013
I should go home.

12:22.080 --> 12:23.881
You should get back to your family.

12:28.720 --> 12:30.754
Good night, Jamie.

12:30.822 --> 12:35.859
Good night... Angie.

12:52.710 --> 12:55.378
My body is my business.

12:55.447 --> 12:58.315
Well... business is dope.

13:03.787 --> 13:05.055
Motherfucker!

13:05.122 --> 13:07.324
Yeah! Beat his ass!

13:07.391 --> 13:08.524
You wanna fucking touch her?

13:08.592 --> 13:11.294
Yeah, yeah, fucker!

13:11.362 --> 13:13.295
Punk!

13:14.698 --> 13:15.965
- Don't come back!
- Jesus.

13:16.032 --> 13:17.900
- Yeah, come on!
- Fucking get out of here!

13:17.968 --> 13:19.669
Yo! He touched her ass, yo!

13:19.736 --> 13:22.037
He got what he deserved.
Get back in your fucking bar.

13:22.105 --> 13:23.739
I'll beat down every motherfucker in there!

13:29.412 --> 13:32.081
That was awesome.

13:32.148 --> 13:34.749
What the fuck you talking about?

13:34.817 --> 13:37.919
I snatched it from his neck.

13:40.457 --> 13:42.024
This is where you live?

13:42.092 --> 13:45.060
I don't actually spend a whole
lot of time here, I guess.

13:45.128 --> 13:46.928
I kinda hang out all over.

13:46.996 --> 13:49.330
- With other girls?
- Naw! It's not like that.

13:49.398 --> 13:51.099
- I just...
- Shh.

13:51.166 --> 13:53.635
I don't care.

13:58.173 --> 14:00.575
I lied to you before.

14:00.643 --> 14:02.710
Turns out I am gonna fuck you tonight.

14:02.777 --> 14:04.712
I forgive you for lying.

14:06.848 --> 14:10.851
If you lie to me, I
won't forgive you, okay?

14:10.919 --> 14:14.088
So don't do it.

14:14.156 --> 14:15.890
- Ah.
- Okay?

14:15.957 --> 14:18.092
- Yeah.
- Promise?

14:18.160 --> 14:19.927
Yeah.

14:36.844 --> 14:38.878
Got any blow?

14:38.946 --> 14:41.848
It's always better with.

14:41.916 --> 14:44.984
Yeah. I got some.

14:50.091 --> 14:56.029

to think about leaving ♪

14:56.096 --> 14:59.732

How long until you can go again?

16:17.308 --> 16:18.808
Girl, I don't know.

16:18.876 --> 16:20.844
Things got better between us for a minute

16:20.911 --> 16:23.079
- after the thing with the baby...
- Right.

16:23.148 --> 16:24.781
but he's still keeping shit from me.

16:24.849 --> 16:26.550
He's never done that before.

16:26.618 --> 16:27.784
Well, if he didn't act the
fool every now and then,

16:27.852 --> 16:29.553
then he wouldn't be a man.

16:29.621 --> 16:31.721
Ooh, girl, look at these.

16:31.789 --> 16:33.523
These are fly.

16:33.590 --> 16:35.525
I bought them in black last week.

16:35.592 --> 16:37.861
Of course you did.

16:37.928 --> 16:40.563
Is there a reason why
you pressing up on me?

16:40.631 --> 16:42.699
Well, it's my job to protect you.

16:42.767 --> 16:45.969
Who told you I need protection? Ghost?

16:46.037 --> 16:48.271
- No, I-I was just...
- You need to back up, Shawn.

16:48.338 --> 16:52.575
Oh, well, you can protect me anytime, baby.

16:52.643 --> 16:53.976
Come along, 'Keisha.

16:54.044 --> 16:55.545
Relax, girl.

16:55.612 --> 16:56.979
Everybody know that boy
only got eyes for you,

16:57.047 --> 16:59.048
jump in front of the
damn two train for you.

17:01.117 --> 17:05.788
You go out earlier this morning?

17:05.855 --> 17:08.691
I missed you.

17:08.758 --> 17:11.727
It's nice to be missed.

17:11.795 --> 17:13.528
I was out shopping with 'Keisha,

17:13.596 --> 17:15.798
Shawn was breathing down my neck.

17:15.865 --> 17:18.200
I checked him, and he said
he was there to protect me.

17:18.267 --> 17:20.069
Something I need to know about, Ghost?

17:20.136 --> 17:21.935
Me and the kids need to
get out of town for a while?

17:22.003 --> 17:23.204
Nah, nothing like that.

17:23.271 --> 17:24.906
Kid is just being over-protective,

17:24.973 --> 17:26.308
taking his job too seriously.

17:26.375 --> 17:28.108
I'll tell him to ease up.

17:28.176 --> 17:29.911
I'll talk to you after work.

17:29.978 --> 17:31.779
You meeting up with Tommy?

17:31.847 --> 17:33.648
Headed to the club.

17:33.716 --> 17:35.850
I don't recall you getting
up at the crack of dawn

17:35.918 --> 17:37.719
to head out to the Wash N' Folds,

17:37.786 --> 17:39.553
emptying quarters out the dryer.

17:39.621 --> 17:40.922
This is different.

17:40.989 --> 17:42.289
Yeah, looks that way.

17:42.357 --> 17:44.158
Steady trying to figure out why.

17:44.226 --> 17:46.160
I told you why.

17:46.228 --> 17:49.563
Seems like you could spend the
day at home with me and Yas.

17:49.631 --> 17:50.932
You know, like you used to.

17:50.999 --> 17:53.334
Everything I'm doing,
I'm doing for you, Tasha!

17:53.401 --> 17:55.168
What the fuck is that supposed to mean?

17:55.237 --> 17:58.004
Everything.

18:03.878 --> 18:07.013
So Lobos' New York distributor
is meeting with his network.

18:07.081 --> 18:09.182
We just don't know where
or when it's happening.

18:09.251 --> 18:11.051
My C.I. is trying to get me specifics,

18:11.119 --> 18:12.685
but as of right now I don't have anything

18:12.754 --> 18:14.087
beyond what I told you already.

18:14.155 --> 18:15.889
Your C.I.'s info is bogus.

18:15.957 --> 18:17.657
For the record, we haven't heard shit

18:17.725 --> 18:19.325
about a big meeting with
Lobos' New York distributor,

18:19.393 --> 18:20.961
and we've been shaking trees all over town.

18:21.028 --> 18:22.262
Maybe you're shaking around trees.

18:22.329 --> 18:24.631
Or maybe this lead is just bullshit.

18:24.698 --> 18:26.066
It's not bullshit.

18:26.134 --> 18:27.333
It's legit intel that's been cultivated

18:27.401 --> 18:29.001
from a confidential informant.

18:29.069 --> 18:30.370
It's how a real investigation is conducted.

18:30.437 --> 18:31.837
Mm!

18:31.905 --> 18:33.139
I don't need you to tell me

18:33.206 --> 18:34.940
how an investigation is conducted.

18:35.008 --> 18:36.309
I been on Lobos since you were sucking

18:36.377 --> 18:38.745
on your mommy's titty, Knox.

18:38.812 --> 18:40.280
I was on your mama's titty last night.

18:40.347 --> 18:42.848
Where are we on fatman?

18:42.916 --> 18:44.716
Our opinion hasn't changed.

18:44.785 --> 18:47.719
If in fact Lobos is looking to
switch up his current connect,

18:47.788 --> 18:50.156
Anibal Santalises would be
the most likely candidate.

18:50.223 --> 18:52.357
He's got the infrastructure,
the relationships,

18:52.425 --> 18:54.160
and the disposition.

18:54.227 --> 18:55.961
We've got guys on him 24/7.

18:56.029 --> 18:57.863
I want you two on him.

18:57.931 --> 18:59.364
If he's the player you say he is,

18:59.432 --> 19:02.634
I want Agent Medina to handle
surveillance personally.

19:02.702 --> 19:06.104
- Saxe, you work up the warrant.
- Understood.

19:06.172 --> 19:08.106
You stay on this distributor meeting.

19:08.174 --> 19:10.642
If it's happening, we need to be there.

19:14.314 --> 19:16.147
Ruiz won't go near Harlem.

19:16.215 --> 19:17.748
Rolla won't fuck with the Bronx,

19:17.817 --> 19:19.350
Anibal ain't feeling either of them.

19:19.418 --> 19:20.952
We need to find some neutral ground

19:21.020 --> 19:22.220
for this sit-down.

19:22.288 --> 19:23.688
Ghost! This shit's tomorrow!

19:23.755 --> 19:25.256
We need to get everything in place.

19:25.324 --> 19:27.158
Yeah, we'll do it at the
Chinese spot downtown.

19:27.226 --> 19:28.927
Lok Sing? What about food?

19:28.994 --> 19:30.261
Rolla's on some vegan shit now.

19:30.329 --> 19:32.063
This ain't no goddamn catered affair!

19:32.131 --> 19:33.997
I put fucking food on their
table every fucking day, Tommy.

19:34.065 --> 19:35.399
Motherfuckers gotta eat.

19:35.467 --> 19:37.167
If one of these guys is behind these hits,

19:37.235 --> 19:38.869
we need to make sure they
don't have the drop on us.

19:38.937 --> 19:40.304
I don't want anybody stashing fucking gats

19:40.372 --> 19:41.939
before we all get there, all right?

19:42.006 --> 19:43.941
We do it okeydoke 20
minutes before game time.

19:44.008 --> 19:45.443
And get the room swept.

19:45.510 --> 19:47.110
I don't want anybody
listening in on our shit.

19:47.178 --> 19:48.713
We need to get to the bottom of this

19:48.780 --> 19:50.113
so things will go back to normal.

19:50.181 --> 19:51.915
We need our shit to work smoothly

19:51.983 --> 19:54.151
so we can think about other things.

19:54.219 --> 19:58.455
What other things?

19:58.522 --> 20:01.124
Not this.

20:21.098 --> 20:24.598
_

20:25.716 --> 20:27.716
_

20:28.741 --> 20:32.142
_

20:34.216 --> 20:35.916
_

20:38.395 --> 20:42.097
What do you got?

20:42.164 --> 20:44.366
I got what you want.

20:44.434 --> 20:46.502
But it's gonna cost you.

20:46.569 --> 20:49.772
I was watching the FBI files...

20:49.839 --> 20:52.173
and they said...

20:52.241 --> 20:55.476
informants get paid.

20:55.544 --> 20:59.915
So... you want information
about this meeting...

20:59.982 --> 21:02.183
you pay.

21:04.387 --> 21:07.155
Something tells me...

21:07.223 --> 21:11.192
you're not hurting for cash.

21:11.260 --> 21:13.160
Hmm.

21:13.228 --> 21:15.430
You got me there, mami.

21:15.497 --> 21:19.366
You ever think, if we'd
met a different way...

21:19.435 --> 21:22.437
Nope.

21:22.504 --> 21:25.807
Just tell me what I need to know.

21:25.874 --> 21:29.410
Lok Sing Restaurant,
downtown, 2:00 tomorrow.

21:29.477 --> 21:31.412
And the New York connect's gonna be there?

21:31.479 --> 21:33.080
Mm-hmm.

21:33.148 --> 21:34.514
We need you to wear a wire.

21:34.582 --> 21:36.883
I told you I'm not invited.

21:36.952 --> 21:38.319
I'm on the outside.

21:38.386 --> 21:41.221
Then how'd you find out?

21:41.289 --> 21:45.158
Little birdie told me.

21:45.225 --> 21:49.228
Leave Isabel alone, Nomar.

21:49.296 --> 21:52.799
Even if that's how you get
your precious information?

21:57.605 --> 22:00.507
Be careful no one makes
you coming out of here.

22:00.575 --> 22:02.908
Mm-hmm.

22:06.080 --> 22:09.048
Pastrami, pickles, and Swiss. Hot.

22:09.116 --> 22:10.450
Mm!

22:10.517 --> 22:11.917
Thanks for picking up Tariq from practice.

22:11.986 --> 22:13.519
I would've asked Shawn, but...

22:13.587 --> 22:15.421
- he's with Ghost.
- Mm.

22:15.489 --> 22:16.956
Speaking of Shawn,

22:17.024 --> 22:20.425
he was hanging real close this morning.

22:20.494 --> 22:22.928
Told me it was for my protection.

22:22.996 --> 22:24.463
What's going on, Tommy?

22:24.531 --> 22:26.164
You know, I got kids to think about.

22:27.934 --> 22:30.369
We got it under control. Don't worry.

22:30.436 --> 22:32.170
Ghost ain't telling me shit.

22:32.238 --> 22:34.272
It's all, "The club this, the club that."

22:36.009 --> 22:37.609
So sick and tired of
hearing about fucking Truth.

22:37.676 --> 22:39.144
Me too!

22:39.212 --> 22:41.613
Did Ghost tell you he took a grip of money

22:41.680 --> 22:44.416
out of our personal account
and used it to open Truth?

22:44.484 --> 22:45.917
That's none of my business.

22:45.985 --> 22:47.919
He didn't even tell me about it.

22:47.987 --> 22:50.222
I had to find out myself.

22:50.289 --> 22:52.924
Look where you live,
Tasha. Look at your life.

22:52.992 --> 22:54.458
From where I'm sitting,

22:54.527 --> 22:56.895
it looks like things are
playing out pretty good for you.

22:56.962 --> 22:59.063
So he dug in a little
deep on this club bullshit.

22:59.131 --> 23:01.332
So what? Doesn't change
shit about your life.

23:01.400 --> 23:05.570
He's changing, Tommy. Ghost is changing.

23:05.638 --> 23:09.940
And that's not good for either of us.

23:10.008 --> 23:12.309
You got any more pastrami up in here?

23:32.630 --> 23:34.565
You should really take the
"B" to the "N" or the "R"

23:34.632 --> 23:36.967
from the safe house.

23:37.035 --> 23:38.501
You tailed me?

23:38.570 --> 23:40.103
If you insist on seeing
that piece of shit alone,

23:40.171 --> 23:41.438
I'm gonna watch your back.

23:41.505 --> 23:42.972
You can't fucking spy on me, Greg.

23:43.040 --> 23:44.674
You're right.

23:44.741 --> 23:46.509
Instead I should tell Frankie
that you're subverting protocol

23:46.577 --> 23:49.345
to play footsie with that dick.

23:49.413 --> 23:52.048
Did he even give you anything?

23:58.455 --> 24:01.457
I got the address.

24:03.994 --> 24:06.261
You're good.

24:13.669 --> 24:15.270
You're fucking stalking me.

24:15.338 --> 24:17.139
Ah.

24:18.741 --> 24:21.543
I'm only stalking you...

24:21.611 --> 24:23.512
because I like you so much.

24:33.355 --> 24:35.556
You're a dumbass.

24:35.625 --> 24:38.159
You're a pain in my dumb ass.

24:41.030 --> 24:42.631
Mm.

24:45.067 --> 24:48.002
Did you tell Frankie about what Nomar said?

24:48.069 --> 24:51.205
- She's gonna call in the cavalry.
- I know.

24:51.273 --> 24:53.007
- Better go right.
- I know that.

24:55.611 --> 24:59.147
What do you think about me
leaving some clothes over here?

24:59.214 --> 25:01.616
At this point, I'm staying
over here a few nights a week.

25:01.683 --> 25:05.152
It'll be easier for me to
just leave some shit here.

25:05.219 --> 25:07.087
You got any room in this drawer?

25:10.158 --> 25:12.259
What the hell was that?

25:12.326 --> 25:13.761
Um...

25:13.828 --> 25:17.531
Angela, what the hell was that?

25:17.598 --> 25:19.166
Are you hiding something in that drawer?

25:19.233 --> 25:23.803
- Of course not.
- Then what's the problem?

25:23.871 --> 25:27.073
What's going on here?

25:27.141 --> 25:28.575
You haven't wanted to hang out,

25:28.643 --> 25:30.510
you've been distracted
when we have hung out,

25:30.578 --> 25:32.111
and now you practically take my hand off

25:32.180 --> 25:33.446
when I mentioned leaving
some clothes over here.

25:33.514 --> 25:35.148
So what's up?

25:35.216 --> 25:39.085
I mean, what are we doing here?

25:41.188 --> 25:43.622
Is there someone else?

25:43.691 --> 25:45.491
No.

25:45.559 --> 25:47.526
There's no one else.

25:47.594 --> 25:49.528
Then what is it?

25:55.868 --> 25:59.471
I'm going home.

25:59.539 --> 26:02.408
Greg!

26:28.500 --> 26:30.735
We have directional cameras
set up on the street,

26:30.802 --> 26:32.637
but we couldn't get inside.

26:32.705 --> 26:34.339
There's just too many people
going in and out of there

26:34.406 --> 26:36.140
over the past 24 hours.

26:36.208 --> 26:38.075
Did you guys hear that?
We couldn't get inside.

26:38.143 --> 26:39.777
Mm-hmm.

26:39.845 --> 26:42.279
Control, dispatch, for a 730 switching,

26:42.347 --> 26:44.749
secondary transmission. Stand by.

26:44.816 --> 26:46.416
According to Valdes,

26:46.484 --> 26:48.085
this meeting's supposed
to start in an hour.

26:48.153 --> 26:49.419
Yeah, and Anibal's still up in his house

26:49.487 --> 26:51.455
eating pints of Cherry fucking Garcia.

26:51.522 --> 26:53.423
How the hell are they gonna
have a meeting without him?

26:53.491 --> 26:55.459
That's because there is no meeting.

26:55.526 --> 26:57.795
Valdes is full of shit.

26:59.464 --> 27:03.367
Who'd you rather bang, Valdes or Frankie?

27:03.434 --> 27:05.569
- Frankie don't take dick.
- I know!

27:05.637 --> 27:07.170
But let's just say she does.

27:07.238 --> 27:09.172
Or she would.

27:09.240 --> 27:11.341
I'd go with Frankie.

27:11.409 --> 27:14.311
I like a broad with balls.

27:14.379 --> 27:17.280
Ah, I think I'd smash Valdes.

27:17.347 --> 27:19.348
She's always got that
expression on her face

27:19.416 --> 27:21.751
like she's so fucking full of herself.

27:21.819 --> 27:23.586
I wanna see what her face looks like

27:23.654 --> 27:25.421
when she's full of me.

27:25.489 --> 27:27.791
You mean half full.

27:27.858 --> 27:29.893
Fuck you.

27:32.496 --> 27:34.397
They're all on their way.

27:34.464 --> 27:36.198
Time for the okeydoke.

27:36.266 --> 27:38.701
Do it now.

27:49.445 --> 27:53.415
You always land on your
feet, don't you, Kantos?

27:53.482 --> 27:55.217
Who's the man in charge?

27:55.285 --> 27:56.885
You're looking at him.

27:56.953 --> 28:00.355
Nobody is stupid enough to
bankroll a spot for you, Kantos.

28:00.423 --> 28:02.357
Come on. Where's the boss?

28:02.425 --> 28:05.327
He's not here.

28:05.394 --> 28:08.196
- What can I help you with?
- Jack shit.

28:08.263 --> 28:11.666
You can help us with exactly jack shit.

28:11.734 --> 28:13.768
We need to be laying eyes
on your boss right now,

28:13.836 --> 28:15.870
or you're not gonna be
opening up your doors tonight

28:15.938 --> 28:18.873
or any other night.

28:21.643 --> 28:23.377
I got Victor, Darien, Queso, and Jayski

28:23.445 --> 28:25.313
patting motherfuckers
down for steel at the door.

28:25.380 --> 28:26.914
Now as far as food goes,
I'm just having them bring

28:26.982 --> 28:28.549
those fucking Pu Pu
platter joints with a little

28:28.616 --> 28:30.417
something-something for everybody.

28:30.485 --> 28:32.286
I figure Anibal's gonna be
hungry as a motherfucker.

28:33.588 --> 28:34.722
You remember when he ate 25 donuts?

28:34.789 --> 28:35.957
Yeah?

28:36.024 --> 28:39.326
Shutting us down? Tonight?

28:43.665 --> 28:46.266
I'm on my way, Kantos.

28:46.334 --> 28:48.535
Drop me off at the club.

28:48.603 --> 28:50.203
Where the fuck you going?

28:50.271 --> 28:51.572
Cops saying they're gonna shut down Truth

28:51.639 --> 28:53.206
unless they speak to me face to face.

28:53.274 --> 28:54.741
You're gonna have to run
this meeting solo, Bro.

28:54.808 --> 28:56.343
Are you fucking with me?

28:56.410 --> 28:57.977
We're getting hit, you shut shit down.

28:58.044 --> 28:59.912
Now we got an entire network meeting

28:59.980 --> 29:01.681
and you're gonna go deal with
some bullshit at the club?

29:01.749 --> 29:04.384
They're shutting the club down, Tommy!

29:04.451 --> 29:06.252
We wash more money up in there than we do

29:06.319 --> 29:07.653
at every other front we got combined.

29:07.721 --> 29:09.355
You want me to just fuck this off?

29:09.423 --> 29:11.957
- Hell, yeah, I do.
- They want the fucking owner.

29:12.025 --> 29:14.426
That's me. I gotta deal with it.

29:14.494 --> 29:16.495
You can handle this on your own, Tommy.

29:16.562 --> 29:18.663
I don't even believe this shit.

29:18.731 --> 29:21.000
You got this.

29:24.504 --> 29:26.738
Just don't tell them
you're turning shit back on.

29:26.806 --> 29:28.840
Until we know who's hitting
us, we're not moving any weight.

29:28.909 --> 29:31.543
- Go get Julio.
- No time.

29:31.611 --> 29:34.546
I'll take the kid with me.

29:34.614 --> 29:36.648
Hit me when you're done.

29:39.919 --> 29:43.922
You ready for your
balls to drop today, kid?

29:43.989 --> 29:46.491
I want photos of anybody
and everybody on that block.

29:46.559 --> 29:48.493
I don't give a shit if
it's little Sally Kimball

29:48.560 --> 29:49.693
walking her cockapoo,

29:49.761 --> 29:51.262
I want her photographed and I.D.'d,

29:51.330 --> 29:52.696
and I want the dog's license number.

29:52.764 --> 29:55.499
- Are all our cameras up?
- They're up.

29:55.567 --> 29:57.035
6987, now confirmed to copy.

29:57.102 --> 29:58.869
Out.

30:03.042 --> 30:05.142
_

30:27.898 --> 30:29.366
Everything's been permitted,

30:29.434 --> 30:30.934
the place is up to
code, all our licenses...

30:31.002 --> 30:33.603
business, beverage, noise... are current.

30:33.671 --> 30:35.772
Yeah, you see, the problem is, Jimmy...

30:35.840 --> 30:37.874
you don't mind if I
call you "Jimmy," do you?

30:37.942 --> 30:40.577
See, the problem is we
know illegal narcotics

30:40.644 --> 30:42.812
have been sold inside this establishment.

30:42.880 --> 30:45.815
As you can imagine that's
a big problem for us.

30:45.883 --> 30:47.484
Yeah, well, we're in the process

30:47.551 --> 30:48.952
of tracking down the dealer right now.

30:49.019 --> 30:50.587
And I'm gonna make sure
I turn him over to you

30:50.654 --> 30:52.321
as soon as I find him,
okay? You have my word.

30:52.389 --> 30:54.423
And that's great, Jimmy.

30:54.491 --> 30:56.425
I mean, that's all a man really has, right?

30:56.493 --> 30:58.027
His word.

30:58.095 --> 30:59.628
But in this instance, I
don't think your word's

30:59.696 --> 31:01.030
really gonna do the trick.

31:01.098 --> 31:03.466
So what are you thinking,
Ed, two weeks or so?

31:03.533 --> 31:05.368
I'm not following. What
do you mean by "Two Weeks"?

31:05.435 --> 31:07.870
Jimmy, we gotta shut you down
for at least 14 business days.

31:07.937 --> 31:10.438
This is totally unreasonable.
We have a business to run.

31:10.507 --> 31:12.040
We gotta go through all your paperwork,

31:12.108 --> 31:14.676
we gotta get health in here,
we gotta get fire in here.

31:14.744 --> 31:16.545
We gotta make sure
everything's on the up and up.

31:16.613 --> 31:19.114
Officer, I just told you.
Everything's up to code.

31:19.181 --> 31:20.716
Well, sometimes it seems that way

31:20.783 --> 31:22.050
when it really isn't that way.

31:22.118 --> 31:23.785
This is bullshit!

31:23.853 --> 31:25.487
Enough. Look.

31:25.555 --> 31:27.622
What do you say you give my
partner and I some time, huh,

31:27.689 --> 31:31.459
to work out the kinks?

31:34.130 --> 31:37.065
- Pleasure.
- The pleasure's mine.

31:39.668 --> 31:41.869
Oh, and hey...

31:41.937 --> 31:45.806
keep us posted on that drug sting of yours.

31:51.747 --> 31:54.815
- They're gonna be back.
- No shit.

31:59.687 --> 32:01.788
- This is a restaurant?
- Yeah.

32:01.856 --> 32:05.592
In our business, you try
not to use the front door.

32:05.660 --> 32:08.895
Oh, hey, hey, hey. Sorry.

32:08.963 --> 32:11.497
Here's how it's gonna play. I
sit down, you stand behind me.

32:11.566 --> 32:12.599
Look straight ahead.

32:12.667 --> 32:14.168
You don't look anyone in the eye.

32:14.235 --> 32:16.036
And no matter what, you
don't say a fucking word.

32:16.103 --> 32:17.671
Ever.

32:17.738 --> 32:19.472
And by the way, while I'm thinking of it,

32:19.540 --> 32:21.041
lay off Tasha, man.

32:21.108 --> 32:23.577
You don't spook her
under any circumstances.

32:23.644 --> 32:26.079
Get it? Let Ghost handle his wife.

32:26.146 --> 32:29.449
All right, time to focus on this sit-down.

32:29.516 --> 32:31.150
Stop distracting me, man.

32:38.258 --> 32:40.659
What the fuck?

32:40.727 --> 32:42.462
What is it?

32:42.529 --> 32:44.063
It ain't anything good.

32:45.932 --> 32:48.634
What about the entrance on
Elizabeth Street, anything?

32:48.702 --> 32:51.570
Nothing.

32:51.638 --> 32:55.107
Is there another way in?

32:55.174 --> 32:56.775
Wait.

32:56.843 --> 32:58.176
Isn't there an old tunnel system

32:58.244 --> 32:59.678
underneath all these buildings

32:59.746 --> 33:00.879
that the Tongs used back in the day?

33:00.947 --> 33:02.447
Yeah.

33:02.515 --> 33:03.849
But the entrance to the
only remaining tunnel

33:03.917 --> 33:05.217
is on Doyers Street.

33:05.284 --> 33:06.784
That's out on Chatham Square.

33:06.852 --> 33:08.786
They wouldn't use that to come here.

33:08.854 --> 33:10.589
I'm just thinking about what's
underneath this neighborhood.

33:10.656 --> 33:14.092
Get me a blueprint for the restaurant.

33:23.102 --> 33:26.470
Angela, the agents already
canvassed the building.

33:26.538 --> 33:27.972
The entrances are covered.

33:28.040 --> 33:31.643
Did they walk through all the floors?

33:31.710 --> 33:36.914
See, there's no other entrance
to Lok Sing from the street.

33:36.982 --> 33:41.018
But if they came from
the building behind it,

33:41.085 --> 33:43.254
the basement could still have
a connecting door underground.

33:43.321 --> 33:45.189
Street level, you'd never know

33:45.257 --> 33:47.791
you could get to the restaurant that way.

33:47.859 --> 33:50.594
We should have known.

33:50.662 --> 33:55.165
They're too smart to walk
through the front door.

33:55.232 --> 33:56.967
It's a guess.

33:57.035 --> 33:59.536
- You're right.
- We looked.

33:59.603 --> 34:01.872
- Are you absolutely sure?
- Mm-hmm.

34:01.939 --> 34:04.274
Because it's your call. It's on you.

34:04.341 --> 34:06.176
And if I'm right, and they're in there,

34:06.243 --> 34:08.178
then we gotta go in right now.

34:08.245 --> 34:09.713
We don't have shit on them.

34:09.781 --> 34:11.148
We can't bust in there and arrest them

34:11.215 --> 34:13.550
for just having lunch.

34:13.617 --> 34:15.284
I just want to see his face, Greg.

34:16.887 --> 34:18.954
I want to see him and know who he is.

34:19.022 --> 34:20.657
Once we I.D. that distributor,

34:20.724 --> 34:23.926
we're this close to turning
him and getting Lobos.

34:33.904 --> 34:35.603
We're going in.

34:41.610 --> 34:43.879
I guess Anibal can't tell time.

34:49.051 --> 34:50.752
So...

34:50.820 --> 34:52.187
how's everybody doing?

34:52.255 --> 34:54.054
We'd be better if we had product to sell.

34:54.123 --> 34:56.257
- I'm losing corners.
- Me too.

34:56.326 --> 34:58.293
Is that why you've been
stepping all over mine?

34:58.361 --> 35:00.061
Those aren't my people.

35:00.129 --> 35:01.696
Just 'cause they black don't make 'em mine.

35:01.764 --> 35:03.564
- They flying your flag.
- Bullshit.

35:03.632 --> 35:04.933
And if they say they are, they lying.

35:05.000 --> 35:06.201
- Shut up.
- You're lying, Rolla.

35:06.268 --> 35:07.568
Kiss my ass, Ruiz.

35:07.636 --> 35:08.737
Shut the fuck up!

35:08.804 --> 35:10.038
We may beef on the streets,

35:10.106 --> 35:11.572
but in here, we're business partners.

35:11.640 --> 35:13.174
Speaking of partners, where's yours?

35:13.242 --> 35:14.809
We call this big, important meeting

35:14.877 --> 35:17.612
and Ghost doesn't even bother to show up?

35:19.114 --> 35:21.014
So not only is he not getting us product...

35:21.082 --> 35:25.953
but he doesn't respect
us enough to be here?

35:26.020 --> 35:27.622
I got a connect in Mexico.

35:27.689 --> 35:28.989
Says he can get us fish scale

35:29.057 --> 35:30.725
for half of what we're paying now.

35:30.792 --> 35:32.260
Out of where?

35:32.327 --> 35:33.894
Nueva Leon.

35:33.962 --> 35:36.830
Ghost has been overcharging us.

35:36.898 --> 35:39.133
We can do better.

35:43.104 --> 35:46.106
I'm turning shit back on.

35:46.174 --> 35:50.244
I'm gonna start moving
weight to all of you again.

35:50.311 --> 35:51.844
Hey.

35:51.912 --> 35:53.713
Let the agents clear
the room first, Angela.

35:53.781 --> 35:55.682
You wanna go with Ruiz
and try another connect,

35:55.750 --> 35:57.284
go right ahead.

36:01.221 --> 36:03.757
We're happy with you and Ghost, Tommy.

36:03.824 --> 36:06.259
We don't do business with the Spanish.

36:06.327 --> 36:07.994
What do you mean, Spanish?

36:08.061 --> 36:11.230
I look to you like I'm
from Spain, motherfucker?

36:11.298 --> 36:13.732
- When you come back...
- FBI! Let me see your hands!

36:13.801 --> 36:15.902
On your knees 'cause our shit is purer,

36:15.969 --> 36:17.770
we're gonna charge you double, Ruiz.

36:17.838 --> 36:20.739
Don't move!

36:23.277 --> 36:26.011
Spring rolls up in this spot
ain't got shit on Lok Sing.

36:26.078 --> 36:29.047
In fact, I'd consider
sucking a dick right now

36:29.115 --> 36:30.749
for some of them Lok Sing green beans.

36:30.817 --> 36:32.384
Oh, hell, no.

36:32.452 --> 36:34.653
Why you switch up the spot for
the meeting at the last second?

36:34.721 --> 36:37.656
Can never be too careful.
Always keep 'em guessing.

36:37.724 --> 36:39.090
Can I get a fork, please?

36:39.158 --> 36:42.727
We gotta know who's been hitting us.

36:42.795 --> 36:44.429
Where the fuck is Anibal?

36:44.496 --> 36:46.231
How long?

36:46.299 --> 36:47.833
It could be one or two hours,

36:47.900 --> 36:49.167
three at the most.

36:49.235 --> 36:50.768
And it was just the cut to the neck?

36:50.837 --> 36:53.738
That's all she wrote. Looks professional.

36:53.806 --> 36:55.373
Excuse me for a minute.

36:55.441 --> 36:57.775
Who are you, and why the fuck
are you in my crime scene?

36:57.843 --> 36:59.109
- DEA.
- Fuck off.

36:59.177 --> 37:00.445
This is NYPD business.

37:00.512 --> 37:01.879
We were surveilling Santalises

37:01.947 --> 37:03.448
for involvement with Felipe Lobos.

37:03.515 --> 37:06.050
You mean you were right
outside when this happened?

37:06.117 --> 37:08.118
Wow.

37:08.186 --> 37:10.822
Bang-up criminal
interdiction there, gentlemen.

37:10.889 --> 37:12.457
I think I'll handle it from here.

37:12.524 --> 37:15.459
- Detective...
- Beat it!

37:15.526 --> 37:17.461
Let's go.

37:17.528 --> 37:19.163
Where you at?

37:19.231 --> 37:20.831
This sit-down should've ended a while ago.

37:20.899 --> 37:23.133
Hit me back.

37:23.201 --> 37:24.801
What sit-down?

37:24.870 --> 37:27.704
Just trying to find Tommy. Hey.

37:27.772 --> 37:30.006
Tommy went to a sit-down alone?

37:30.074 --> 37:31.475
No, he took Shawn with him.

37:31.542 --> 37:33.176
Shawn?

37:33.244 --> 37:35.379
Since when do Tommy and
Shawn do meetings without you?

37:35.446 --> 37:37.781
Tommy needs to start stepping it up.

37:37.849 --> 37:40.116
Why? You going somewhere?

37:40.184 --> 37:44.087
No, I'm not going anywhere, Tasha.

37:44.154 --> 37:47.456
I'm stuck here, right where you want me.

37:47.524 --> 37:51.094
What was the sit-down about?

37:54.564 --> 37:57.500
Senor Lobos. Que paso?

38:12.115 --> 38:14.450
Shawn, it's Tasha.

38:14.518 --> 38:18.253
I need you to pick up
some groceries for me.

38:18.321 --> 38:22.124
Fantasma, how are you?

38:22.191 --> 38:23.425
How's things?

38:23.492 --> 38:25.760
Things are under control, Jefe.

38:25.828 --> 38:27.495
Are they?

38:27.563 --> 38:30.065
I find it interesting that
the death of one Primera

38:30.133 --> 38:32.935
and the insubordination of another

38:33.002 --> 38:37.405
meet your definition of... "Under Control."

38:37.473 --> 38:38.807
Death?

38:38.874 --> 38:40.554
_

38:41.045 --> 38:42.345
_

38:43.570 --> 38:46.830
_

38:47.995 --> 38:50.095
_

38:50.185 --> 38:52.386
I was hoping he was the problem,

38:52.454 --> 38:54.455
and you eliminated him.

38:54.522 --> 38:57.158
But now I see I was wrong.

38:57.225 --> 38:58.959
_

38:59.026 --> 39:01.294
NYPD should pay better.

39:01.362 --> 39:04.064
_

39:04.131 --> 39:06.299
The question is not why I know

39:06.367 --> 39:08.534
that Anibal is dead,

39:08.602 --> 39:10.870
the question is why you don't know

39:10.938 --> 39:12.472
Anibal is dead,

39:12.539 --> 39:15.207
and why your friend, Vibora Ruiz,

39:15.275 --> 39:18.177
is so anxious to take your position

39:18.244 --> 39:20.112
in my organization.

39:20.180 --> 39:22.381
He reached out to you directly?

39:22.449 --> 39:24.016
Of course.

39:24.084 --> 39:26.953
I said no to his proposal
out of deference to you,

39:27.020 --> 39:29.822
and the promise that you would handle

39:29.890 --> 39:31.357
the problems in your network...

39:32.993 --> 39:34.893
A promise that is yet unfulfilled.

39:36.896 --> 39:41.500
You see, Ghost, I refuse
to tolerate disloyalty

39:41.567 --> 39:43.469
in the men that work for me.

39:43.536 --> 39:46.205
The moment I detect disloyalty,

39:46.272 --> 39:49.340
I cut it out like a cancer.

39:49.408 --> 39:54.579
If you don't, it will grow and
the whole organism will die.

39:54.647 --> 39:58.249
_

39:58.317 --> 40:00.852
_

40:00.920 --> 40:03.522
Have a good night, Ghost.

40:07.192 --> 40:09.160
I specifically told you not to tell them

40:09.228 --> 40:10.961
when we're turning shit back on.

40:11.030 --> 40:12.897
Ruiz said he had another
connect with a better price.

40:12.964 --> 40:14.265
The whole point of the meeting

40:14.333 --> 40:15.966
was to figure out who's robbing us.

40:16.035 --> 40:17.301
You said the motherfucker who ain't thirsty

40:17.369 --> 40:18.636
is the guy who's hitting us.

40:18.703 --> 40:20.204
Anibal didn't even show to the meeting.

40:20.272 --> 40:21.639
Is that not thirsty enough for you?

40:21.706 --> 40:24.107
- Anibal's dead.
- Get the fuck out of here.

40:24.275 --> 40:26.576
- Lobos called and told me.
- How the fuck does he know?

40:26.644 --> 40:29.513
- He got people in NYPD.
- Jesus Christ!

40:29.581 --> 40:31.114
You do it?

40:31.182 --> 40:33.316
- Do what?
- Anibal.

40:35.954 --> 40:39.022
You seemed pretty fucking
sure it was him hitting us.

40:41.325 --> 40:44.194
Are you taking shit
into your own hands, huh?

40:44.262 --> 40:46.496
- Come here to me.
- I'm already here.

40:46.564 --> 40:48.165
Get out of my face.

40:48.232 --> 40:50.367
You fucking kidding me?

40:50.435 --> 40:52.635
You think I killed Anibal?

40:52.703 --> 40:54.437
You think I'd play you like that?

40:54.504 --> 40:56.138
Hmm?

40:56.206 --> 40:57.574
We had a conversation.

40:57.641 --> 40:59.141
You told me sit tight, and I did.

40:59.209 --> 41:00.476
I also told you not to tell them

41:00.544 --> 41:03.179
we were gonna start moving shit.

41:05.749 --> 41:09.052
I didn't fucking kill Anibal, Ghost.

41:19.496 --> 41:21.564
Lobos said Ruiz is behind this shit.

41:21.631 --> 41:23.399
Said he met with him about stepping it up.

41:23.467 --> 41:25.101
He was gappin' the fuck
off as this meeting.

41:25.168 --> 41:27.302
Ruiz has to go, Tommy.

41:27.369 --> 41:29.605
Fuck, yeah. Do or die, baby.

41:32.174 --> 41:35.143
Do or die.

41:53.262 --> 41:55.062
Girl, it's like you said.

41:55.131 --> 41:58.065
You know, if I wanna
know what Ghost is up to,

41:58.134 --> 42:01.035
then who better to tell me than
the cat who's with him all day?

42:02.537 --> 42:04.105
I mean, I wouldn't say

42:04.172 --> 42:06.273
he's wrapped around my little finger yet...

42:06.341 --> 42:09.543
