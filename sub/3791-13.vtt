01:17.110 --> 01:20.602
All right.
You got the whole thing?

01:20.647 --> 01:23.639
I got the whole thing 1400 different
ways already, Drama.

01:23.683 --> 01:25.446
Just keep snapping.
It's digital.

01:25.485 --> 01:27.419
- There is no waste.
- Yeah, only my time.

01:27.454 --> 01:31.049
Come on, come on. We're not going
anywhere until somebody recognizes me.

01:31.091 --> 01:33.218
Favor me, but get some
of the other guys too.

01:33.259 --> 01:35.557
- Okay.
- There you go.

01:35.595 --> 01:38.257
Hey, jerk-off!
What kind of loser

01:38.298 --> 01:40.027
takes pictures in front of his
own billboard?

01:40.066 --> 01:42.193
There you go, Drama.
You've been recognized.

01:42.235 --> 01:44.169
E don't count.
It's gotta be a stranger.

01:44.204 --> 01:45.694
Johnny, it looks good.

01:45.738 --> 01:47.296
Looks like it's
gonna be a big hit.

01:47.340 --> 01:50.707
- Thanks, bro!
- We're off to Amanda's.

01:50.743 --> 01:52.711
Yo, Vince, don't forget
to invite her to your birthday party.

01:52.745 --> 01:55.213
Don't worry, she'll be there.
You just make sure it's a good one.

01:55.248 --> 01:57.341
Like we'd throw
you anything less?

01:57.383 --> 01:59.874
- Nice.
- Later, guys.

01:59.919 --> 02:02.149
Later. Oh, here comes
some chicks.

02:02.188 --> 02:04.622
Keep snapping.
See if they recognize me.

02:06.059 --> 02:07.526
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:07.560 --> 02:09.494
Was that Vince Chase
you were talking to?

02:13.833 --> 02:15.494
Hey, Vince.
Happy birthday.

02:15.535 --> 02:17.093
Hey,
thank you.

02:17.137 --> 02:20.106
- Happy birthday, Vince.
- Thanks!

02:20.140 --> 02:22.472
- Happy birthday, Vince.
- Thank you.

02:24.144 --> 02:27.113
Hey, is that my agent or
America's next top model?

02:27.147 --> 02:29.615
Don't patronize me.
I know I look like shit.

02:29.649 --> 02:31.480
I was up all night
fighting with my ex.

02:31.518 --> 02:33.611
- Over the house again?
- No, the dog.

02:33.653 --> 02:36.986
What kind of man sues for custody
of a labradoodle?

02:37.023 --> 02:38.718
Sit.

02:38.758 --> 02:40.225
So...

02:40.260 --> 02:42.353
who did their required
reading last night?

02:42.395 --> 02:43.862
How many?

02:43.897 --> 02:45.364
I read
four of them.

02:45.398 --> 02:47.161
That's impressive.
Vince?

02:47.200 --> 02:48.895
I read half of three.

02:48.935 --> 02:51.096
Look, Amanda,
you have to understand

02:51.137 --> 02:53.105
that you sent some
very large scripts.

02:53.139 --> 02:55.300
It's true. The scripts Ari
used to send us

02:55.341 --> 02:58.208
were in the 90-to-104-page range.
Yours are closer to 140.

02:58.244 --> 03:00.644
It leaves me no
time for skin care.

03:00.680 --> 03:02.841
I'm surprised Ari doesn't
just send coverage.

03:02.882 --> 03:05.248
That's all he
reads anyway.

03:05.285 --> 03:08.379
Look, I can find you
another popcorn movie, no problem,

03:08.421 --> 03:10.946
but you asked me to find something
you could sink your teeth into.

03:10.990 --> 03:13.356
Do you have something?
'Cause none of these quite got us.

03:13.393 --> 03:15.623
This one will.

03:15.662 --> 03:17.562
You guys know
I don't hard-sell,

03:17.597 --> 03:20.395
but this
is the one.

03:20.433 --> 03:22.230
127 pages.

03:22.268 --> 03:23.997
Manageable.

03:25.605 --> 03:28.369
It's Edith Wharton's
"Glimpses of the Moon".

03:28.408 --> 03:30.399
Studio's been trying
to tackle it for years,

03:30.443 --> 03:31.808
nobody could get
a handle on it.

03:31.844 --> 03:34.506
Steve Zaillian did.
The script is wonderful.

03:34.547 --> 03:36.139
Did you guys like
"Age of Innocence"?

03:36.182 --> 03:37.706
I don't remember
the story,

03:37.750 --> 03:39.980
but I do remember after seeing it
I knew how to hold my fork.

03:40.019 --> 03:42.647
I liked "Age of Innocence".
Is Scorsese doing this?

03:42.689 --> 03:44.156
No, Sam Mendes is.

03:44.190 --> 03:46.055
Oh, Sam Mendes.
I love "American Beauty".

03:46.092 --> 03:49.323
Great.
Read at least 90, then.

03:49.362 --> 03:51.057
And they need
a quick answer.

03:51.097 --> 03:53.122
Looks like we have
homework tonight.

03:53.166 --> 03:54.895
No, not tonight.

03:54.934 --> 03:57.664
Come on, tonight we're celebrating
somebody's birthday.

03:57.704 --> 03:59.171
Hey, she remembered.

03:59.205 --> 04:00.729
Nice, what did you
get me?

04:09.649 --> 04:11.116
Great gift,
Amanda!

04:11.150 --> 04:12.617
Great gift.
Thank you.

04:12.652 --> 04:14.119
You're all
welcome.

04:14.153 --> 04:15.780
How is the party
planning coming?

04:15.822 --> 04:17.414
I'm sure it's
gonna be sick.

04:17.457 --> 04:20.187
I'm running things,
so use your imagination.

04:20.226 --> 04:23.457
I'm picturing lots of strippers
and porn stars, Turtle.

04:23.496 --> 04:26.192
He's promised us he's gonna invite
some regular girls too.

04:26.232 --> 04:29.292
Just a couple.
You got to come help fill the quota.

04:29.335 --> 04:30.802
I wouldn't
miss it.

04:30.837 --> 04:32.566
You're welcome to
bring a guest...

04:32.605 --> 04:34.869
if you have
someone special.

04:34.907 --> 04:36.602
Um...

04:36.643 --> 04:39.544
there is nobody,
but thank you, Johnny.

04:39.579 --> 04:42.571
- That's good to know.
- Uh-huh.

04:45.518 --> 04:47.213
Come on! Ah!

04:47.253 --> 04:49.016
Oh, Jesus.

04:49.055 --> 04:50.784
What?

04:50.823 --> 04:53.383
12:00.

04:58.164 --> 05:01.224
Defense! Defense! Defense!

05:03.436 --> 05:06.803
The Lakers game!
The fucking Lakers game!

05:06.839 --> 05:10.172
Oh, Jesus, the house
that I built!

05:10.209 --> 05:12.234
Maybe it was
his birthday present.

05:12.278 --> 05:14.542
You think?

05:14.580 --> 05:17.140
I put him on the fucking court
on Arbor Day,

05:17.183 --> 05:18.707
and that's
her present?

05:18.751 --> 05:21.015
God, she's so
fucking wrong for him.

05:21.054 --> 05:23.181
Oh, Ari, I hate
to see you like this.

05:23.222 --> 05:24.416
Shut up, Lloyd,
I'll be fine.

05:24.457 --> 05:26.186
Your horoscope
doesn't think so.

05:26.225 --> 05:28.557
It said this was going to be a very
tumultuous week.

05:28.594 --> 05:31.427
I bet she'll be at
his birthday party.

05:31.464 --> 05:32.954
Fuck!

05:32.999 --> 05:35.524
He'll probably let her
blow out his candles.

05:35.568 --> 05:37.263
Still no
invite for me, huh?

05:37.303 --> 05:39.498
Not from Vince.
But we did receive an evite

05:39.539 --> 05:41.939
to Patrick Dempsey's house
for running charades.

05:41.974 --> 05:45.205
You know, I've spent Vince's
last five birthdays with him.

05:45.244 --> 05:47.838
I know.
And you know

05:47.880 --> 05:50.178
your present's gonna be
so much better than hers.

05:50.216 --> 05:52.616
It is, Lloyd, it is.
And you want to know why?

05:52.652 --> 05:55.746
Because I'm actually
giving him something that he wants.

05:55.788 --> 05:57.619
Aww.

05:59.726 --> 06:01.216
What the fuck
does that mean?

06:01.260 --> 06:03.660
Heartbreak.

06:08.234 --> 06:10.065
Okay, we need
to talk party.

06:10.103 --> 06:12.037
I think we need
to lose the venue.

06:12.071 --> 06:13.732
Why?
Privilege is great.

06:13.773 --> 06:15.798
They only serve
liquor till 2:00 AM.

06:15.842 --> 06:17.605
We want this thing
to go all night.

06:17.643 --> 06:19.838
Or all morning,
as the ladies come a'running.

06:19.879 --> 06:21.938
Whatever, Turtle.
Your point?

06:21.981 --> 06:24.347
What about Ari?
Does he make the guest list?

06:24.384 --> 06:26.011
No. No no no
no no no no.

06:26.052 --> 06:28.020
No exes
at a birthday party.

06:28.054 --> 06:30.352
- Never never never.
- Hey, that's Vince's call.

06:30.390 --> 06:33.325
I think baby bro was a little freaked
out about seeing him last night.

06:33.359 --> 06:34.758
Nah, Vince
don't get rattled.

06:34.794 --> 06:36.625
Besides us and his mother,
Ari is the longest

06:36.662 --> 06:39.290
relationship Vince has ever had.
He must've been a little rattled.

06:39.332 --> 06:42.267
That's why it's best after a breakup,
professional or otherwise,

06:42.301 --> 06:44.201
to split the town
into even territories.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.205
Ari pays 200 grand a year
for those tickets.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.173
I doubt we can have him banned
him from the Staples Center.

06:48.207 --> 06:50.175
- Yo yo.
- Morning, bro.

06:50.209 --> 06:52.700
- Eggs benedict?
- Yeah, that'd be great, Johnny.

06:52.745 --> 06:56.340
Hey, E, the script is good.
Real good.

06:56.382 --> 06:58.282
- Wow, you read it?
- Cover to cover.

06:58.317 --> 07:00.080
- When?
- Last night.

07:00.119 --> 07:03.486
- Couldn't sleep, bro?
- No, I slept like a baby.

07:03.523 --> 07:07.357
So, E, looks like I beat you
this time, huh?

07:07.393 --> 07:08.860
Guess again.
I read it.

07:08.895 --> 07:10.487
And?

07:10.530 --> 07:12.725
I liked it.
What I understood of it, anyway.

07:12.765 --> 07:15.097
Yeah, I did run to my dictionary
a couple times.

07:15.134 --> 07:17.261
It's different than anything I ever
thought I'd do,

07:17.303 --> 07:19.168
but I love that
Amanda thinks like this.

07:19.205 --> 07:21.935
I'll call her, have her set up a meet-
and-greet with Mendes.

07:21.974 --> 07:24.374
Actually, you know what?
I'll call her.

07:24.410 --> 07:26.776
I want her to know I'm taking
this very seriously.

07:28.448 --> 07:30.313
Hey, maybe
that's her now.

07:30.349 --> 07:32.681
We have this weird synch,
don't you think?

07:32.718 --> 07:35.380
- It's uncanny.
- Hello?

07:35.421 --> 07:37.184
Hello?

07:39.392 --> 07:40.984
Did you just
prank Vince?

07:41.027 --> 07:43.928
I never heard the guy answer the phone
before. It spooked me!

07:43.963 --> 07:46.488
He's gonna know it's you.
Our company name comes up.

07:46.532 --> 07:49.729
Why does it come up? Whose idea was
that? What's the fucking point?

07:49.769 --> 07:51.828
- I don't know.
- He's not gonna know it's me.

07:51.871 --> 07:54.237
- It could've been you calling Drama.
- True.

07:54.273 --> 07:56.332
What do I care if
he thinks it was me?

07:56.375 --> 07:59.811
I'm meant to call.
I'm calling him again.

07:59.846 --> 08:01.814
In a minute.

08:01.848 --> 08:04.043
You call Drama first
so he thinks it was you.

08:07.286 --> 08:08.913
Oh, hey,
Lloyd, what's up?

08:08.955 --> 08:12.516
I bet you're getting some calls
about my billboard, huh?

08:12.558 --> 08:15.425
Uh, no. I haven't heard a thing
about it. Did it go up yet?

08:15.461 --> 08:17.656
Are you kidding?
It's huge.

08:17.697 --> 08:19.665
You obviously
don't drive Sunset.

08:19.699 --> 08:21.599
To and from work every day,
but I'll look again.

08:21.634 --> 08:23.261
- Do.
- I will.

08:23.302 --> 08:25.827
So, listen,

08:25.872 --> 08:27.840
as long as I've got you on the phone,
is Vince there?

08:27.874 --> 08:29.535
What the fuck are you doing?

08:29.575 --> 08:32.874
What you should've done a long time
ago... getting your man back.

08:32.912 --> 08:34.379
So is he
there?

08:34.413 --> 08:36.244
Yeah, he's here,
Lloyd, why?

08:36.282 --> 08:37.909
'Cause, I don't know,
you know,

08:37.950 --> 08:39.780
Ari's here too.
Maybe they should say hi.

08:39.818 --> 08:41.912
I don't think that's such
a great idea.

08:41.953 --> 08:45.651
Put him on the phone, Johnny, or no more
agency comps at Burke Williams.

08:47.393 --> 08:49.190
Someone wants to
talk to you, bro.

08:52.565 --> 08:55.090
- Vinnie boy!
- Hey, Ari.

08:55.134 --> 08:57.398
- How you doing?
- I'm doing great.

08:57.436 --> 09:00.633
I'm doing great.
You know, how you doing?

09:00.673 --> 09:03.198
I'm doing.
I'm doing.

09:04.977 --> 09:07.036
Listen, I don't want
to beat around the bush.

09:07.079 --> 09:09.479
It's your birthday and it made me
realize how much I miss you.

09:09.515 --> 09:13.042
I mean, not like Lloyd
misses you, but friends-wise.

09:13.085 --> 09:15.144
So, uh, I mean,
you miss me, Vinnie?

09:15.187 --> 09:17.155
Yeah...
you know,

09:17.189 --> 09:19.350
friends-wise,
I miss you, yeah.

09:19.392 --> 09:21.724
Great great.
That's great. Listen, uh...

09:24.864 --> 09:26.627
I got a...
I got a gift for you,

09:26.666 --> 09:28.964
and I could just, uh, you know,
I could sent it over.

09:29.001 --> 09:30.901
But I, you know,
I'd love to see you.

09:30.937 --> 09:32.962
I'd rather see your
face and, you know,

09:33.005 --> 09:35.473
grab some dinner,
sort of catch up.

09:35.508 --> 09:38.170
Bring E if you want.
What do you say?

09:38.210 --> 09:40.770
Um...

09:40.813 --> 09:43.281
Make it lunch.
No dinner.

09:43.316 --> 09:44.943
Why not dinner?

09:44.984 --> 09:46.679
You're leading him
on with dinner.

09:46.719 --> 09:49.449
You're saying something I don't
think you want to say.

09:49.488 --> 09:51.183
And what
am I saying?

09:51.223 --> 09:53.748
That you want to jump back in
the sack with him.

09:53.793 --> 09:55.852
I mean, come on,
do you ever go to dinner

09:55.895 --> 09:57.658
with a disgruntled ex,
and she really

09:57.697 --> 09:59.562
wasn't just looking
for some tasty dessert?

09:59.599 --> 10:02.067
I agree with Drama. I mean, he's making
me sick with the metaphors,

10:02.101 --> 10:03.693
but Ari's not doing
this out of friendship.

10:03.736 --> 10:04.896
We'll make it lunch.

10:04.937 --> 10:06.370
You could still have
dessert after lunch.

10:06.405 --> 10:08.134
Better make
it a coffee.

10:08.174 --> 10:12.110
Good thinking. Coffee says "I sit,
but I ain't sucking".

10:12.144 --> 10:13.805
What the fuck is wrong
with you, Drama?

10:13.846 --> 10:16.337
Cursed with wisdom is all.
Oh, yeah.

10:16.382 --> 10:19.442
- That looks good.
- Oh, that's in the hole.

10:19.485 --> 10:21.476
Hey hey hey.

10:21.520 --> 10:23.681
- What's this? No secrets.
- I'm with Vince.

10:23.723 --> 10:27.056
The whispering stops, or nobody's
getting a souffle at dinner tonight.

10:27.093 --> 10:29.152
Relax, Drama.
It's about the party venue.

10:29.195 --> 10:31.720
If it's about money, you don't have
to spend a lot to throw me a party.

10:31.764 --> 10:34.324
Remember ninth grade?
You surprised me at Friendly's.

10:34.367 --> 10:37.063
- That was awesome.
- Yeah it was.

10:37.103 --> 10:39.071
And I got jerked off by the girl
who made the fribbles.

10:39.105 --> 10:41.972
We're not doing this party
at Friendly's, Vince,

10:42.008 --> 10:43.999
and you're not paying for anything.
Turtle, did you take care of the booze?

10:44.043 --> 10:45.067
Done.

10:45.111 --> 10:47.511
- Give me back my Visa.
- No problem.

10:47.546 --> 10:50.743
Wow, Turtle, I've never seen you
cough up plastic so easily.

10:50.783 --> 10:53.115
That's 'cause I still
got the kid's MasterCard,

10:53.152 --> 10:55.177
and that's the one
I'm keeping for the venue.

10:55.221 --> 10:57.917
Hey, jerk-off, you're a grown man.
Get yourself some credit.

11:00.359 --> 11:02.088
You like it or you love it?

11:02.128 --> 11:03.959
- I love it.
- Great.

11:03.996 --> 11:06.624
That's all I need to hear.
I'll set the meeting with Sam.

11:06.666 --> 11:08.930
Okay, great.

11:08.968 --> 11:10.902
Listen, Amanda,
I gotta go.

11:10.936 --> 11:13.131
- I'll check in with you a little later.
- Okay.

11:13.172 --> 11:14.730
- Bye.
- Bye.

11:14.774 --> 11:17.106
Remember: he starts talking business,
change the subject.

11:17.143 --> 11:19.077
You don't think we can have a friendly
conversation with Ari?

11:19.111 --> 11:20.703
I don't think I've ever had
a conversation with him

11:20.746 --> 11:22.475
where he didn't
want something. You?

11:22.515 --> 11:24.745
- I'll change the subject.
- Boys!

11:24.784 --> 11:26.376
Boys, look at that.

11:26.419 --> 11:28.580
Wouldn't even have dinner
with me, huh?

11:28.621 --> 11:31.556
Weird. Kinda feels like
I'm trying to fuck you guys.

11:31.590 --> 11:33.387
Are you?

11:33.426 --> 11:35.758
Look at that... E!
I love it, huh?

11:35.795 --> 11:38.628
Still got little-man's complex
enough to want to fight.

11:38.664 --> 11:40.529
Sit down.
Sit down.

11:51.444 --> 11:53.605
- So...
- So...

11:55.014 --> 11:57.983
So happy fucking birthday.

11:58.017 --> 12:00.747
Oh wow, Ari, thanks.

12:00.786 --> 12:02.413
What is it?

12:02.455 --> 12:04.719
Something that you
really really want.

12:04.757 --> 12:07.487
You know what?
Wait till later to open it. For now...

12:07.526 --> 12:10.427
let's put surprises aside
and just enjoy

12:10.463 --> 12:12.829
one another's company.
We can do that, right?

12:12.865 --> 12:14.992
We can try.

12:17.770 --> 12:20.398
A booze cruise,
I like it.

12:20.439 --> 12:22.600
No last call
on the open water.

12:22.641 --> 12:24.836
And no neighbors
to complain about the noise.

12:24.877 --> 12:29.177
Holy shit, look at that...
another billboard. I'm everywhere.

12:29.215 --> 12:31.445
Spreading like the plague
that you are, Drama.

12:31.484 --> 12:33.782
- Does that guy look familiar to you?
- Huh?

12:33.819 --> 12:35.980
- On the billboard. That's me.
- Oh, congrats.

12:36.021 --> 12:38.012
But I can't see that far
without my glasses.

12:38.057 --> 12:40.753
You ever hear of Lasik?

12:40.793 --> 12:43.091
So what's the price
on this thing?

12:43.129 --> 12:46.121
- 20 Gs for the night.
- 20 Gs, huh?

12:46.165 --> 12:48.326
- Is that a problem?
- No no no, no problem.

12:48.367 --> 12:51.495
- What's the capacity?
- 200, 250 max.

12:51.537 --> 12:54.165
See, that, my friend,
is a problem.

12:54.206 --> 12:56.265
You got anything
that's a little bigger?

12:56.308 --> 12:59.436
- Not a word about business, E.
- Very impressive.

12:59.478 --> 13:01.173
Should I invite him
to the party?

13:01.213 --> 13:02.908
You wanna invite him
to the party?

13:02.948 --> 13:04.176
I wanna invite him
to the party.

13:04.216 --> 13:05.581
Then you should
invite him to the party.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.415
Here he comes.

13:07.453 --> 13:10.786
All right, what do you guys
thing about dessert?

13:10.823 --> 13:12.256
- No.
- No dessert.

13:12.291 --> 13:14.885
- All right, just the check then.
- I already got it, Ari.

13:14.927 --> 13:17.589
Wow, E, you are really
officially keeping this unofficial.

13:17.630 --> 13:19.655
Just friends, Ari,
just friends.

13:19.698 --> 13:22.462
Just friends, absolutely.

13:22.501 --> 13:24.526
So, Ari, I'm having a little...

13:24.570 --> 13:26.834
I'd love to come to your
party, Vinnie. Thank you.

13:26.872 --> 13:29.602
I'm afraid this card
has been declined.

13:32.111 --> 13:33.772
Trouble on the home front, E?

13:33.813 --> 13:36.304
No, it's all good.
I got it.

13:36.348 --> 13:38.782
Calm down, E! You're gonna give
yourself a stroke.

13:38.818 --> 13:41.286
You maxed out three of my fucking
credit cards, Turtle!

13:41.320 --> 13:43.845
- That's worse than a stroke.
- I'm a little over budget, that's all.

13:43.889 --> 13:45.117
How much is a little?

13:45.157 --> 13:47.455
What are you talking about?
You were with him the whole time.

13:47.493 --> 13:49.427
I didn't have my calculator with me.

13:49.461 --> 13:52.430
You're about to dip into your own
pocket... better learn to finger count.

13:52.464 --> 13:54.694
Exactly how far over budget
are you, Turtle?

13:55.935 --> 13:57.766
50... maybe!

13:57.803 --> 14:00.135
50? The whole budget
was supposed to be 50.

14:00.172 --> 14:02.231
E, this party's gonna suck
if we don't do it up.

14:02.274 --> 14:05.675
- We have an 800-person guest list.
- It's supposed to be 200.

14:05.711 --> 14:07.269
It's not my fault
Vince is popular.

14:07.313 --> 14:09.076
It's a disease
in the Chase lineage.

14:09.114 --> 14:10.877
All right.

14:10.916 --> 14:12.975
I'll go up to 35 grand
and that's it.

14:13.018 --> 14:16.078
So unless you and Drama are planning
on ponying up more of your own cash,

14:16.121 --> 14:17.850
that brings us
to a grand total of 60.

14:17.890 --> 14:19.619
- What about what I spent?
- Get it back.

14:19.658 --> 14:21.683
- Yeah, get it back.
- Fuck you, Drama.

14:21.727 --> 14:24.195
We're gonna celebrate your
40th at Chuck E. Cheese.

14:24.230 --> 14:26.960
Are you guys fighting
over the party?

14:26.999 --> 14:29.559
Fighting? We're not fighting.
Did you hear fighting?

14:29.602 --> 14:31.832
Why don't you guys just
let me pay for it, really?

14:31.871 --> 14:33.270
'Cause it's our present
to you, Vince, so stop.

14:33.305 --> 14:35.239
Okay. Okay.

14:35.274 --> 14:38.266
You guys want to see
Ari's present to me?

14:38.310 --> 14:39.937
Yeah.

14:43.515 --> 14:46.313
"Medellin"?
Is this a joke?

14:48.921 --> 14:51.412
- Did he like it, E?
- What the fuck does it mean, Ari?

14:51.457 --> 14:55.154
It means that Vince doesn't have to do
some paint-drying Edith Wharton novel.

14:55.194 --> 14:58.391
- How'd you know about that?
- It is my job to know all, E.

14:58.430 --> 15:01.729
Do you know Edith Wharton?
Always the same movie.

15:01.767 --> 15:03.632
Guy can't fuck the girl
for five years

15:03.669 --> 15:07.127
'cause those were the times.
Can Vince really relate to that?

15:07.172 --> 15:09.470
What's up with "Medellin"?

15:09.508 --> 15:12.238
Why don't you check in with your girl?
She should be able to tell you.

15:12.278 --> 15:14.746
- You fucking with us, Ari?
- Why would I do that, E?

15:14.780 --> 15:17.305
We're all friends.
This is a gesture of friendship.

15:17.349 --> 15:20.750
Now, as a friend,
I advise you to call your girl

15:20.786 --> 15:23.619
and find out why she didn't
hand it to you first.

15:25.891 --> 15:29.122
Car service for nine grand?!
What's that all about?

15:29.161 --> 15:31.527
That's for drunk girls
to get home safely.

15:31.563 --> 15:35.294
We don't need any dead bodies
littering Sunset. Better keep that.

15:35.334 --> 15:38.235
Maybe I could lose the floral
arrangements for four grand.

15:38.270 --> 15:42.036
No no no, nothing gets a girl wet
like a calla-lily centerpiece.

15:42.074 --> 15:44.975
There's just no way to do this!
Maybe we should call it off.

15:45.010 --> 15:48.036
We're not calling it off, Turtle.
We're not getting any younger.

15:48.080 --> 15:49.570
How many of these things
do you think we got left?

15:49.615 --> 15:51.242
We got a lot left.

15:51.283 --> 15:53.478
Don't drag us into
your twilight years, Drama.

15:53.519 --> 15:57.717
Ha, funny. Here, get rid of all
the high-end brand alcohol.

15:57.756 --> 15:59.883
Go generic.
It'll save us a ton.

16:01.794 --> 16:03.853
You know what,

16:03.896 --> 16:07.195
why don't we go the complete
opposite way and make us a ton?

16:07.232 --> 16:08.893
I don't follow.

16:08.934 --> 16:10.697
You will.

16:10.736 --> 16:13.102
You will follow me
to the greatest party ever.

16:13.138 --> 16:15.732
Grabbing us
the Yellow Pages.

16:15.774 --> 16:19.369
I don't understand why Ari is sending
you guys scripts in the first place.

16:19.411 --> 16:21.072
This is a movie Vince has been dying
to do for two years,

16:21.113 --> 16:22.740
so he just figured, you know.

16:22.781 --> 16:25.579
No, I don't know, Eric. As far
as I know "Medellin" is not available.

16:25.617 --> 16:27.710
Benicio is signed on
to play Pablo Escobar.

16:27.753 --> 16:30.085
If that changes, you think
it's going to be a big secret?

16:30.122 --> 16:31.749
What are you getting
so upset about?

16:31.790 --> 16:34.020
I'm upset because in order
to do my job, I need to know

16:34.059 --> 16:36.687
I don't have another voice whispering
in my client's ear behind my back.

16:36.729 --> 16:39.459
- You don't.
- Good.

16:39.498 --> 16:41.591
- Make sure Ari knows that.
- I will.

16:41.633 --> 16:43.931
You should know Ari's going to be at
Vince's birthday party.

16:43.969 --> 16:46.164
- You okay with that?
- As long as he's dressed as a friend.

16:46.205 --> 16:48.503
All right.
I'll check in later.

16:48.540 --> 16:51.202
See you, Eric.

16:56.482 --> 16:58.382
Why would Ari send
that script if it's not true?

16:58.417 --> 17:00.351
I don't know, but I'm gonna
find out tonight.

17:00.386 --> 17:03.549
Find out tonight, but could we stay off
the business and have a good time?

17:03.589 --> 17:05.614
Seriously, guys,
this is a celebration.

17:05.656 --> 17:07.146
Okay okay.

17:07.192 --> 17:10.319
I don't know about you guys, but I
cannot wait to get into that party,

17:10.362 --> 17:13.729
- have myself a nice lobster tail.
- Lobster? Nice!

17:13.766 --> 17:16.200
Unless you want some
tasty Kobe beef instead.

17:16.234 --> 17:19.568
We're having that too, Vin.
It's gonna be a surf and turfer's dream.

17:19.605 --> 17:22.233
And what washes surf and turf
down better than Cristal?

17:22.273 --> 17:24.037
Yeah, I upgraded
the champagne too.

17:24.076 --> 17:26.010
What the fuck's he talking
about, Drama?

17:26.045 --> 17:27.740
I don't know, E.
I, uh...

17:27.780 --> 17:30.112
- I know nothing.
- It sounds good though.

17:30.149 --> 17:33.118
Come on, E. Can't you just have a little
faith and not doubt me?

17:33.152 --> 17:35.882
Maybe this one time
I'll have made you proud.

17:35.921 --> 17:38.389
- Oh, Turtle, you're breaking my heart.
- Yeah, mine too.

17:38.424 --> 17:40.119
'Cause we're about to drive
by my billboard

17:40.159 --> 17:41.990
and nobody seems to give a fuck.

17:42.027 --> 17:44.359
Are you kidding?
Of course we give a fuck!

17:46.632 --> 17:49.260
Oh shit, the light's
busted on it.

17:51.336 --> 17:53.201
You gotta be shitting me.

17:56.975 --> 18:00.206
Motherfuckers.

18:13.692 --> 18:16.024
- Wow.
- Holy shit.

18:16.061 --> 18:18.552
Turtle, you know how
to stretch a budget.

18:18.597 --> 18:21.157
- What was the budget anyway?
- Yeah, Turtle?

18:21.200 --> 18:24.465
Calm down, E.
I got help from some friends.

18:24.503 --> 18:26.596
- What friends?
- Those friends.

18:26.638 --> 18:29.106
- What's up, baby?
- You sponsored the party?

18:29.141 --> 18:32.269
Hold off on your judgment
till you see the whole thing.

18:32.311 --> 18:35.769
Thank you, thank you.
Hello.

18:50.229 --> 18:52.356
- Hey, Vince, happy birthday.
- Thanks.

18:52.397 --> 18:54.922
- What's happening, Turtle?
- Happy birthday, Vince.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.094
- Thank you.
- Happy birthday, Vince.

18:57.136 --> 19:00.833
Thanks.
Oh, I'm so glad you made it!

19:00.873 --> 19:02.966
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks, Sloan.

19:03.008 --> 19:04.976
Hi, babe.

19:05.010 --> 19:06.978
Nice small party, Turtle.

19:07.012 --> 19:08.741
Am I a genius
or what, Sloan, huh?

19:08.780 --> 19:10.577
You're a genius.

19:21.126 --> 19:23.560
Listen, guys, just to get
this out of the way,

19:23.595 --> 19:26.291
I called around,
"Medellin" is dead for us.

19:26.331 --> 19:29.425
It's shooting in four weeks with
Benicio. All things are a go.

19:29.468 --> 19:30.730
I'm sorry.

19:30.769 --> 19:32.737
Why would Ari get
our hopes up like that?

19:32.771 --> 19:36.036
- I don't know.
- There he is. Let's ask him.

19:36.074 --> 19:37.871
I'll let you guys take care
of your business.

19:37.910 --> 19:39.639
I'm going to get
some acupressure.

19:39.678 --> 19:41.077
Hey hey, the birthday boy!

19:41.113 --> 19:42.944
And he brought his muscle.
How are you?

19:42.981 --> 19:45.415
Ari, regifting old projects
again, huh?

19:45.450 --> 19:47.441
I'd expect more for
Vince's birthday present.

19:47.486 --> 19:49.545
Like what?
Like floor seats to the Lakers?

19:49.588 --> 19:52.284
I used to give Vince floor seats
because it was a Thursday!

19:52.324 --> 19:54.986
Guys, be nice.
It's is my birthday.

19:55.027 --> 19:58.292
You are absolutely right, Vince.
I am sorry. Let's bury the hatchet.

19:58.330 --> 20:01.561
Happy to, as soon as you tell me why you
sent my client that script.

20:01.600 --> 20:03.090
If you knew Vince
the way I knew Vince,

20:03.135 --> 20:05.194
you'd know how badly
he wants that movie.

20:05.237 --> 20:08.206
- That movie is gone.
- Really?

20:08.240 --> 20:09.935
Benicio is doing it, Ari.

20:09.975 --> 20:11.567
Benicio is falling out of
love with it, Vince.

20:11.610 --> 20:14.545
- That's not what I'm hearing.
- Your ears were always tiny, Amanda.

20:14.580 --> 20:16.707
You don't know what
the fuck you're talking about.

20:16.748 --> 20:18.909
- He's messing with your head.
- Wanna bet your client on it?

20:18.951 --> 20:21.476
Tell you what: if it's true,
Vince goes with me.

20:21.520 --> 20:23.249
I don't bet my clients.

20:23.288 --> 20:24.812
I thought you didn't even
want me back, Ari?

20:24.856 --> 20:27.552
Yeah, I thought you were acting as a
friend. See, you're never what you seem.

20:27.593 --> 20:29.686
Eric, Vince, I need
to talk to you alone.

20:29.728 --> 20:31.696
- So do I.
- Okay, listen,

20:31.730 --> 20:34.062
because this is the deal.
I will not play this game.

20:34.099 --> 20:36.659
Vince, you decide right now
who you're with.

20:36.702 --> 20:39.364
- Me or him, period.
- I'm with you, Amanda.

20:39.404 --> 20:41.634
- Ari is just a friend. Right, Ari?
- Yes.

20:41.673 --> 20:44.506
And as a friend for many years,
I am asking you

20:44.543 --> 20:47.512
to take one minute
alone with me. Please.

20:48.513 --> 20:50.947
One minute.
One.

20:53.218 --> 20:56.710
- Don't worry, he'll be fine.
- I'm not worried, Eric.

20:56.755 --> 20:58.882
I'm annoyed.

21:01.026 --> 21:02.584
It sounds like a great show.

21:02.628 --> 21:04.653
I'm just shocked I haven't heard
anything about it.

21:04.696 --> 21:07.688
Clearly you must not work in
the business. What do you do?

21:07.733 --> 21:10.031
I'm a writer for
"The Hollywood Reporter".

21:10.068 --> 21:11.933
But don't take it
personally.

21:11.970 --> 21:14.097
I write about movies
and I rarely watch TV.

21:14.139 --> 21:15.629
Me neither!

21:15.674 --> 21:17.767
I know you better
than she does.

21:17.809 --> 21:19.504
I know everything
that you need.

21:19.544 --> 21:22.012
I can get you anything
that you want

21:22.047 --> 21:24.948
and I can't sit back
and watch you piss away

21:24.983 --> 21:26.780
your whole career
like this.

21:26.818 --> 21:30.083
Ari, you said you just wanted
to be friends.

21:30.122 --> 21:31.919
I lied.

21:31.957 --> 21:34.357
I can't just be friends.
I just can't.

21:34.393 --> 21:37.794
Jesus. You think you're the only one
who can help me?

21:37.829 --> 21:40.957
I had a goal for you when we first
started. We didn't reach that goal.

21:40.999 --> 21:43.729
We can go out and get
"Medellin" right fucking now.

21:43.769 --> 21:46.067
I swear to God we can
do it, Vinnie.

21:46.104 --> 21:47.969
You just can't stand
to lose, Ari.

21:48.006 --> 21:51.737
I think that's what it is. I mean,
you've got your big agency now,

21:51.777 --> 21:54.143
and your hundreds
of clients, but still...

21:54.179 --> 21:56.909
losing hurts you so much
that you...

21:56.948 --> 22:00.349
you're willing to do anything
no matter how stupid it makes you look.

22:00.385 --> 22:02.319
No, Vinnie, I care so much

22:02.354 --> 22:04.618
that I don't care how stupid
it makes me look.

22:04.656 --> 22:07.648
Ari, you need to move on.
I have.

22:08.994 --> 22:10.859
Hey, they're looking
for you, Vince.

22:10.896 --> 22:12.295
They're ready
for the cake.

22:13.398 --> 22:15.457
We're still friends
though, right?

22:15.500 --> 22:19.061
Yeah. We will
always be friends.

22:19.104 --> 22:21.299
Good.
Come on, Ari.

22:21.340 --> 22:23.103
Let me buy you a slice.

22:23.141 --> 22:25.234
No cake for me.
Getting mean and lean.

22:25.277 --> 22:27.677
- This is the hungry Ari Gold.
- All right, come on.

22:27.713 --> 22:30.841
- He'll be back, hack.
- You want me to walk you to your car?

22:30.882 --> 22:33.476
This town's not safe
for a bitch.

22:58.009 --> 22:59.977
- Make a good wish, Vince!
- Great one.

23:00.011 --> 23:02.775
Hey, don't forget about me, bro!
I had your back all year.

23:02.814 --> 23:04.577
You want me to put you
in my wish, Johnny?

23:04.616 --> 23:05.844
If you don't mind.

23:05.884 --> 23:08.944
What do you want him to wish for, Drama?
That someone recognizes you?

23:08.987 --> 23:11.080
First of all, you don't say what you
want your wish to be out loud,

23:11.123 --> 23:12.818
you dumb fuck.
Second,

23:12.858 --> 23:16.055
I think Vince can figure out a more
rewarding wish to fulfill for me.

23:16.094 --> 23:18.426
Don't worry, I'm gonna wish
for what I always wish for...

23:18.463 --> 23:19.987
that we all
have a great year!

23:20.031 --> 23:23.467
You said it out loud!
You fucked us all.

23:25.670 --> 23:27.433
Whoa! Don't blow
anything out yet.

23:27.472 --> 23:30.339
- Mind holding this up while you do it?
- Oh, Jesus, Turtle.

23:38.150 --> 23:39.879
Yeah!

23:41.420 --> 23:43.513
- Thank you so much. Happy birthday.
- Thank you.

23:43.555 --> 23:45.182
- Vince. Happy birthday, buddy.
- E.

23:45.223 --> 23:47.088
- Good fucking party.
- So, birthday boy,

23:47.125 --> 23:48.922
Just got word
from Sam Mendes's people.

23:48.960 --> 23:51.360
They want to skip a meeting
and go right to an offer.

23:51.396 --> 23:54.160
Nice! I like the new team.
It's gonna be a good year.

23:54.199 --> 23:58.101
I agree, but actually, I think we should
hold off on "Glimpses" for a while

23:58.136 --> 24:00.127
just in case Ari's right.
