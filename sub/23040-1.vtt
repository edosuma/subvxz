WEBVTT

00:08.520 --> 00:11.920
SIX MONTHS LATER

00:13.000 --> 00:16.840
Like every new year,
everyone set a goal to achieve.

00:16.920 --> 00:18.480
NEW YEAR'S CHARITY AUCTION

00:18.560 --> 00:19.840
A personal challenge

00:20.200 --> 00:21.360
something to be improved

00:21.440 --> 00:23.760
that he or she couldn't do
in the last 12 months.

00:25.240 --> 00:30.600
But these are nothing more
than simple New Year’s promises.

00:30.680 --> 00:31.880
...eight...

00:32.000 --> 00:33.680
HAPPY 1929

00:33.760 --> 00:36.480
...ten, eleven, twelve!

00:39.400 --> 00:40.320
Happy New Year!

00:40.800 --> 00:44.040
The year 1929 had just begun,

00:45.120 --> 00:48.280
and we had the chance
to choose how it would get underway.

00:49.000 --> 00:51.920
Would we leave our fates
in the hands of justice?

00:53.360 --> 00:56.680
Or hide a body
to keep enjoying our freedom?

01:14.640 --> 01:16.520
What was that?

01:17.840 --> 01:19.120
Did you hear that?

01:19.200 --> 01:20.840
It was probably a rat. No one's there.

01:21.720 --> 01:24.320
What if someone saw us
putting the body in the car?

01:24.400 --> 01:27.920
No one knows anything.
No one saw anything. Just us.

01:28.000 --> 01:29.440
Our choice was made.

01:29.920 --> 01:31.960
All we could do was wait.

01:33.000 --> 01:36.280
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

02:32.960 --> 02:36.240
40 HOURS EARLIER

02:39.360 --> 02:40.200
Excuse me!

02:53.240 --> 02:54.360
Excuse me.

02:54.440 --> 02:56.160
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

02:57.520 --> 02:58.640
I owe you one.

02:58.720 --> 03:01.920
This girl is so impatient.
She's just so...

03:03.400 --> 03:05.320
Lidia. Lidia! The reports.

03:06.880 --> 03:08.120
Thanks.

03:11.560 --> 03:13.920
Good morning, Mr. Uribe.
I've got the reports...

03:14.000 --> 03:16.840
You should stop
and take a breath once in a while.

03:16.920 --> 03:18.320
CHAPTER 9: THE CHOICE

03:18.400 --> 03:21.560
I thought you got promoted.
Why aren't you upstairs?

03:21.640 --> 03:24.760
Upstairs... Of course. He's upstairs.

03:28.440 --> 03:29.960
Thanks.

03:30.040 --> 03:32.400
Lidia, the reports.

03:40.480 --> 03:41.960
Mr. Uribe.

03:42.040 --> 03:44.480
Miss Aguilar. About time.

03:44.560 --> 03:47.080
Sorry for the delay. Here's your coffee

03:47.160 --> 03:51.800
and the reports you requested on the rise
in subscribers due to automation.

03:51.880 --> 03:53.200
Your suit is ready,

03:53.280 --> 03:57.400
and Miss Millán has been told
she has to present you

03:57.480 --> 04:00.320
with the best candidate
for the job of technical director.

04:01.040 --> 04:02.040
Stop talking.

04:03.840 --> 04:06.520
-I want you to be my pitcher.
-Your what?

04:06.600 --> 04:10.080
You don't know baseball?
Have you never heard of Babe Ruth?

04:10.480 --> 04:12.200
The greatest batter in the world.

04:12.280 --> 04:15.200
Last year he hit 60 home runs
in just one season.

04:15.600 --> 04:17.080
You don't know what that means.

04:17.160 --> 04:20.680
It means he's from another planet,
a total genius.

04:20.760 --> 04:22.920
Arm back, elbow above your shoulder.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.320
But do you know
what I like most about Babe?

04:25.680 --> 04:27.640
You wouldn't know it by looking at him.

04:27.720 --> 04:31.200
He's chubby. His body's too thick,
and his legs too thin.

04:31.760 --> 04:35.800
It's proof that there can be a champ
where you least expect it.

04:35.880 --> 04:39.160
-Now... pitch.
-What?

04:39.240 --> 04:41.840
Throw the ball. I want to bat.
Throw it, for God's sake.

04:41.920 --> 04:45.080
-I have to go over the invitations--
-Shut up and pitch the ball.

04:45.160 --> 04:46.600
-Pitch the ball!
-No!

04:47.200 --> 04:50.240
This isn't what we agreed on
when we negotiated the rotary patent.

04:50.320 --> 04:54.440
You asked me to keep the workers' jobs,

04:54.520 --> 04:57.920
to rehire Miss Carlota Rodríguez
and the engineer Miguel Pascual,

04:58.000 --> 05:00.680
-and you'd get...
-A position in management.

05:00.760 --> 05:02.160
Isn't that what I did?

05:02.680 --> 05:05.520
Aren't you an assistant manager?

05:07.760 --> 05:10.760
Don't play dumb with me, please.

05:10.840 --> 05:13.320
Six months. For six months I've been...

05:13.400 --> 05:15.200
-All right.
-...at it nonstop.

05:15.760 --> 05:19.320
This was supposed to be a promotion,

05:19.400 --> 05:21.280
but I've become your trained monkey.

05:21.360 --> 05:22.200
That's enough.

05:22.880 --> 05:25.400
Stop with these delusions of grandeur.

05:25.480 --> 05:29.040
If you want an opportunity,
you'll have to find it yourself.

05:33.040 --> 05:35.360
It turns out you're a terrible pitcher.

05:52.960 --> 05:54.480
It's been a long time.

05:58.200 --> 06:01.920
Long enough for me to realize
how long you'd been deceiving me.

06:05.200 --> 06:07.200
"Errand girl" would've been appropriate.

06:07.280 --> 06:08.360
ASSISTANT MANAGER

06:11.400 --> 06:13.160
I know I hurt you badly.

06:15.280 --> 06:17.760
And I know you won't forgive me
for what happened.

06:24.120 --> 06:27.360
But let me show you
it's worth taking a chance on us.

06:28.280 --> 06:30.120
I love you more than anyone--

06:30.200 --> 06:32.960
You only love yourself... Alba.

06:35.200 --> 06:36.200
Carlos.

06:38.120 --> 06:41.160
Carlos, please. Please let me explain.

06:41.240 --> 06:43.080
Let me explain, please.

06:45.760 --> 06:47.360
Why did he call you Alba?

06:47.440 --> 06:49.640
Carlos, I didn't--

06:49.720 --> 06:51.120
No, no, no.

06:51.200 --> 06:53.880
Are you Alba? Yes or no?

06:58.320 --> 07:00.200
So, it's her, huh?

07:01.480 --> 07:04.040
The girl at the station
you always talked about.

07:04.120 --> 07:06.600
-The love of your life.
-I tried to tell you, I swear.

07:06.680 --> 07:09.440
But you fell in love,
and I didn't want to hurt you.

07:11.880 --> 07:14.200
I wish I'd never met either of you.

07:15.760 --> 07:16.760
Carlos...

07:17.800 --> 07:19.080
I love you.

07:21.760 --> 07:23.040
I love you.

07:23.120 --> 07:25.760
I'd really like to believe you, Alba.

07:32.400 --> 07:35.080
-Don't call me that.
-Why not? It's your name.

07:35.160 --> 07:38.480
That's not my name. My name is Lidia.
Everything I told you is true.

07:38.560 --> 07:39.640
I don't care.

07:39.720 --> 07:42.600
I don't care about your name
or anything else about you.

07:42.680 --> 07:45.080
Because of you, this company's
in the hands of the Uribes.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.760
If you hadn't stolen the rotary,
I wouldn't have lost it all.

07:47.840 --> 07:49.560
I'm here to get back
what belongs to my family.

07:49.640 --> 07:51.680
-I didn’t--
-My father gave his life for this company.

07:51.760 --> 07:53.720
I didn't want you to lose the company,

07:54.040 --> 07:56.080
but all those people
would've been laid off.

07:56.160 --> 07:58.440
Thank you for thinking of everyone
except me.

08:01.360 --> 08:02.520
Mr. Cifuentes...

08:04.280 --> 08:06.720
The new company director.

08:06.800 --> 08:08.680
I'm glad to see you. Come in.

08:09.800 --> 08:11.240
Come right in.

08:43.200 --> 08:44.760
What's going on?

08:45.640 --> 08:48.080
Since when am I not invited
to these tête-à-têtes?

08:48.160 --> 08:52.000
I demand immediate payment
for damages incurred.

08:52.080 --> 08:53.960
You gave me a fright.

08:54.040 --> 08:55.680
Why'd you push me away, Carlota?

08:55.760 --> 08:59.400
-I didn't know it was Miguel.
-Are we going to spend our lives hiding?

08:59.480 --> 09:02.360
That's Carlota. She took her time
to acknowledge it with me, too.

09:02.440 --> 09:04.480
-And this is different.
-Different?

09:04.840 --> 09:06.920
The world won't change
unless we change it.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.440
-I think you're being hasty.
-Hasty?

09:09.520 --> 09:11.440
I've been telling you for over two months

09:11.520 --> 09:14.160
to tell your friends
we're in a relationship.

09:14.240 --> 09:17.560
If they truly love you,
they'll accept who you are.

09:17.640 --> 09:19.240
You don't understand. My family--

09:19.320 --> 09:22.520
I don't give a shit about your family!
What about me?

09:22.600 --> 09:25.720
-Let's calm down.
-That's easy for you to say.

09:25.800 --> 09:27.160
You're being so unfair.

09:27.240 --> 09:30.240
If people don't accept you
the way you are, they don't love you.

09:30.920 --> 09:32.920
And if you can't accept yourself...

09:34.480 --> 09:37.240
maybe we should reconsider
our relationship.

09:37.320 --> 09:40.760
I don't think this is the time
or the place for this.

09:42.600 --> 09:43.520
Miguel's right.

09:44.880 --> 09:47.120
It's getting late. I'm going back to work.

09:52.320 --> 09:54.720
I’m so sorry you're leaving, Grandma.

09:54.800 --> 09:56.600
Are you sure you can't stay longer?

09:56.680 --> 09:58.200
Until after New Year's Eve?

09:58.280 --> 10:00.400
No, I have to go.

10:01.120 --> 10:02.440
But before you go,

10:02.520 --> 10:06.680
I'd like to treat you
and your granddaughter

10:06.760 --> 10:09.080
to some cream puffs they make here.
You'll see.

10:09.160 --> 10:11.560
-Grandma, you'll be late.
-There's time.

10:11.640 --> 10:13.200
And you love them, Marga.

10:13.920 --> 10:15.720
Then go on, get them.

10:19.920 --> 10:21.760
He's nice, your boyfriend.

10:22.440 --> 10:25.760
-I think he's the one.
-He's the only one.

10:25.840 --> 10:27.200
That's exactly why.

10:38.240 --> 10:40.120
Enjoy, ladies.

10:47.320 --> 10:48.600
Delicious.

10:50.040 --> 10:51.280
A little small.

10:51.760 --> 10:53.160
You and your sweet tooth.

10:53.240 --> 10:55.600
-Here, take mine.
-No, no.

11:04.560 --> 11:07.280
Weren't you going to ask her to marry you
before I left?

11:07.360 --> 11:10.600
-Yes, I was, until you swallowed the ring.
-What?

11:10.680 --> 11:12.440
Grandma, we hailed a taxi.

11:12.520 --> 11:14.040
Give me a hug.

11:14.120 --> 11:17.080
I’m... I'm going, I guess.

11:17.160 --> 11:19.600
Of course, or you'll miss your train.

11:21.200 --> 11:23.720
I didn't say goodbye
to your boyfriend properly.

11:23.800 --> 11:25.400
-Don't worry.
-Okay.

11:25.480 --> 11:28.120
-Take care.
-I'll say hi to everyone.

11:28.200 --> 11:30.520
-Yes, say hi to Angelines.
-Yes.

11:30.600 --> 11:32.360
-Here.
-Hello.

11:32.440 --> 11:33.480
Bye.

11:33.560 --> 11:35.240
-Take care of yourself.
-You, too.

11:39.800 --> 11:42.400
Deep down, my grandma's a sweetheart,
Pablo.

11:43.280 --> 11:44.560
Yes, deep down.

11:50.440 --> 11:53.120
Operator 48. Good morning.
How can I help you?

11:54.120 --> 11:55.200
Ángeles!

11:55.280 --> 11:57.720
I'm glad.
I've been trying to reach you all morning.

11:57.800 --> 12:01.360
Well, I had to leave the telephone
off the hook because Mario's at home.

12:01.440 --> 12:04.440
-He's not feeling well.
-It can't go on like this.

12:04.520 --> 12:07.120
I know, Carlota,
but what do you want me to do?

12:07.200 --> 12:09.640
Mario threatened
to take my daughter from me.

12:10.440 --> 12:12.800
I'd rather this than not have her with me.

12:14.400 --> 12:15.280
I have to go.

12:15.360 --> 12:18.440
-Are you going to the auction tomorrow?
-What?

12:18.520 --> 12:22.240
The auction the company holds every year
to raise money for the foundation.

12:22.320 --> 12:23.760
I forgot all about it.

12:24.760 --> 12:27.400
Ángeles, we really miss you.

12:27.480 --> 12:29.240
Please try to make it.

12:31.760 --> 12:33.360
Who were you talking to?

12:35.160 --> 12:37.240
It was the wrong number.

12:39.440 --> 12:41.760
-Wrong number?
-Yes.

12:44.120 --> 12:46.960
It wasn’t one of your little friends,
was it?

12:47.040 --> 12:48.000
No.

12:51.720 --> 12:54.200
What you're saying sounds like magic,
Mr. Cifuentes.

12:54.280 --> 12:55.880
It's wireless communication.

12:55.960 --> 12:58.680
In Australia, they've used it
for years in police cars.

12:58.760 --> 12:59.960
Officers communicate via radio,

13:00.040 --> 13:03.400
so they don't need a private phone
to pass on reports.

13:03.480 --> 13:05.600
-Look at this.
-No, no...

13:06.640 --> 13:10.440
I'm truly impressed.

13:11.040 --> 13:13.320
Then you accept the proposal.
This is the future.

13:14.320 --> 13:17.120
And what about the present, Mr. Cifuentes?

13:17.600 --> 13:20.960
Developing this project
would take a lot of money.

13:21.840 --> 13:24.600
And to make a lot of money,
what do you need?

13:28.400 --> 13:30.760
To make a lot of money,
you need a lot of customers.

13:32.000 --> 13:35.440
But before that,
we need to make the telephone popular,

13:35.520 --> 13:38.800
make it accessible
so that everyone can have

13:39.320 --> 13:40.600
and will want to have one.

13:42.440 --> 13:44.320
Perhaps I can help you with that.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.560
Excuse me?

13:47.560 --> 13:50.520
I've been thinking for some time
about developing a project

13:50.600 --> 13:52.920
that would enable everyone to communicate.

13:54.080 --> 13:57.040
I could've used it
when I came to the city,

13:57.640 --> 14:01.880
and perhaps it's time to bring it to life.

14:01.960 --> 14:02.800
My goodness.

14:04.080 --> 14:06.600
This is a pleasant surprise.

14:08.040 --> 14:12.240
I'd like to show you I'm good for more
than shining shoes at the company's door.

14:12.320 --> 14:15.000
I'm sorry, I think I missed something.

14:15.080 --> 14:18.400
Are you telling me that just anyone
can come here and propose a project?

14:18.480 --> 14:21.240
No, not just anyone,
but both you and I know

14:21.320 --> 14:24.520
that Miss Aguilar is not just anyone
in this company.

14:25.480 --> 14:27.320
Very well. Tomorrow.

14:29.200 --> 14:32.960
At ten o'clock. Don't be late, please.

14:33.040 --> 14:36.080
I'll be expecting you too, Mr. Cifuentes,
and with new ideas.

14:36.160 --> 14:38.360
Delicious coffee, Miss Aguilar.

14:54.400 --> 14:56.560
Who do you think you are?

14:56.640 --> 15:00.160
Do you think you can just waltz in
and act like you're a senior executive?

15:00.240 --> 15:02.640
No, like the assistant manager that I am.

15:02.720 --> 15:05.200
Don't you think
you've already done me enough harm?

15:06.520 --> 15:08.000
I'm sorry if I hurt you.

15:11.000 --> 15:13.520
I'm sorry if you think I used you.

15:20.880 --> 15:23.000
I want to be with you.

15:31.280 --> 15:33.240
I want the engagement ring back.

15:34.440 --> 15:35.760
What?

15:38.480 --> 15:40.680
There's nothing left between us.

15:45.400 --> 15:47.320
-I don't have it with me.
-No?

15:48.640 --> 15:50.520
I'll give you until tomorrow at 10:00.

15:52.320 --> 15:53.960
Don't be late.

16:19.720 --> 16:21.920
A taxi just brought this for you.

16:30.800 --> 16:35.000
Pablo, I couldn't go back home
with this huge burden on my chest.

16:35.080 --> 16:36.440
What a dilemma.

16:36.520 --> 16:40.400
The ring inside the envelope
is the engagement ring my Eduardo gave me.

16:41.080 --> 16:43.800
Marga always liked it,
ever since she was little,

16:43.880 --> 16:46.120
and I promised her
that one day it'd be hers.

16:46.840 --> 16:50.600
I don't know if it's as pretty as yours,
but I know my girl will love it.

16:51.680 --> 16:53.120
Good luck.

16:53.200 --> 16:55.680
-Eulalia.
-I'll put you on hold, ma'am.

16:57.480 --> 16:59.960
-What are you doing here?
-Be quiet.

17:00.040 --> 17:02.080
-We can't do this.
-I have to tell you something.

17:02.160 --> 17:04.599
But, Pablo, I can't just leave--

17:04.680 --> 17:09.400
I've been trying to tell you something
all day and I can't take it anymore.

17:09.480 --> 17:12.520
So, if I have to say it here,
then let everyone know!

17:12.599 --> 17:13.839
But what, Pablo?

17:13.920 --> 17:16.280
Close your eyes. Close them.

17:21.720 --> 17:23.080
-Oh?
-Okay, now.

17:23.160 --> 17:24.600
-Now? Let's see.
-Yes.

17:26.200 --> 17:27.359
What?

17:27.960 --> 17:28.960
Marga...

17:30.720 --> 17:33.360
-I'm sorry to interrupt.
-Marisol.

17:34.640 --> 17:36.080
Hello, Marisol.

17:36.160 --> 17:38.720
Something happened.
Something very serious.

17:38.800 --> 17:40.040
My father is dying.

17:42.760 --> 17:43.760
What?

17:44.360 --> 17:46.440
I'm so sorry, Marisol.

17:46.520 --> 17:48.560
That's why I rushed here from Barcelona.

17:48.640 --> 17:51.080
He's having
a life-or-death operation tomorrow.

17:51.160 --> 17:53.680
And I have to ask you one last favor.

17:53.760 --> 17:56.440
Of course, of course.
Whatever you need, tell me.

17:56.520 --> 17:58.720
I need you to go with me
to the hospital...

17:58.800 --> 18:00.040
Yes, of course, anything.

18:00.120 --> 18:02.280
...and pretend we're still a couple.

18:02.360 --> 18:03.720
What?

18:03.800 --> 18:05.480
You know my father loved you.

18:05.560 --> 18:09.400
And after our breakup...

18:09.480 --> 18:12.560
I didn't get the chance to tell him...

18:12.640 --> 18:14.560
It's been over six months.

18:14.640 --> 18:18.960
Right, but I got so wound up.

18:19.040 --> 18:21.680
-How can I tell him now?
-Don't worry, Marisol.

18:21.760 --> 18:23.680
Count on me.

18:25.480 --> 18:29.080
Well, you see, Don Genaro
has always been my teacher.

18:29.160 --> 18:31.520
He taught me everything I know
about numbers.

18:31.600 --> 18:35.240
I can't... I can't let him down now.

18:38.080 --> 18:40.400
-When's the operation, tomorrow?
-Tomorrow.

18:40.480 --> 18:43.360
We're waiting for them
to confirm the time.

18:44.600 --> 18:47.880
Well, let me know, and I'll be there.
Don't worry.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.360
-Thank you.
-No problem.

18:56.880 --> 18:58.640
Pablo, I don't trust her one bit.

18:59.400 --> 19:02.960
Marga, her father's dying. Please...

19:03.040 --> 19:07.520
-She'd kill him just to mess with us.
-No! Don't joke about this.

19:07.600 --> 19:09.880
-Please.
-All right.

19:10.880 --> 19:12.920
What did you want to tell me?

19:13.000 --> 19:14.360
Nothing.

19:22.200 --> 19:24.080
MANAGEMENT OFFICE

19:27.680 --> 19:30.120
Lidia, are you coming to the bar with us?

19:30.200 --> 19:34.320
Doña Lola's gone back home for Christmas,
so we don't have a curfew.

19:34.400 --> 19:36.800
Don't tell me
you're working overtime for Uribe.

19:36.880 --> 19:38.200
On the contrary.

19:38.280 --> 19:41.280
He's given me the opportunity
to present a project of my own.

19:41.760 --> 19:43.800
I can't pass up this opportunity.

19:44.480 --> 19:48.000
There are still some loose ends,
and I want it to be perfect.

19:49.560 --> 19:50.880
Who knows?

19:50.960 --> 19:53.880
It could change
the course of my life overnight.

19:53.960 --> 19:55.720
I wish mine could change, too.

19:55.800 --> 19:58.280
-I haven't had a good day, girls.
-Neither have I.

19:59.800 --> 20:02.080
Carlos can't bear to look at me.

20:02.720 --> 20:05.480
He wants me to give
the engagement ring back.

20:06.560 --> 20:08.040
They won't get the better of us.

20:08.640 --> 20:10.480
Maybe you should rest.

20:10.560 --> 20:11.600
Right.

20:12.640 --> 20:13.880
I'm going to stay longer.

20:15.440 --> 20:17.080
-See you tomorrow.
-See you.

20:37.640 --> 20:40.520
PUBLIC PHONE BOOTHS
BY LIDIA AGUILAR

20:57.000 --> 21:00.680
-What are you doing here?
-I had a revelation today.

21:02.960 --> 21:04.760
I suddenly saw everything clearly.

21:06.920 --> 21:10.720
I realized that there's someone I hate,
even more than you.

21:13.680 --> 21:15.400
Me, Lidia.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.160
I can't stand myself.

21:19.920 --> 21:21.360
I disgust myself.

21:22.240 --> 21:23.520
Do you know why?

21:26.160 --> 21:28.280
Because you're still inside me,
like poison.

21:35.200 --> 21:37.960
All these months,
I've tried to stop thinking about you

21:38.040 --> 21:40.520
and to stop desiring you.

21:43.720 --> 21:46.000
I went to the company
because I thought I was cured.

21:54.120 --> 21:56.640
But the worst thing is
I feel like I don't know you.

21:58.520 --> 22:01.440
I don't know what's true and what's a lie.

22:01.520 --> 22:03.000
You do know me, Carlos.

22:03.640 --> 22:07.560
Everything we had was real.
If only I could show you...

22:10.480 --> 22:12.000
I don't even know who you are.

22:14.160 --> 22:17.280
I'll tell you everything about myself.
Everything.

22:18.040 --> 22:20.400
No more secrets or lies.

22:56.120 --> 23:00.240
Extra, extra! New Year's Charity Auction!
Extra, extra!

23:05.120 --> 23:07.240
I've got an errand to run.
I’ll be right back.

23:07.320 --> 23:09.680
-Now?
-It's nothing important. See you in a bit.

23:11.040 --> 23:12.280
He’s up to something.

23:13.360 --> 23:16.320
Don't you think he's been very mysterious
these past two weeks?

23:19.360 --> 23:22.040
Do you look at me like that
when I walk away?

23:22.120 --> 23:23.160
What?

23:23.240 --> 23:26.160
I don't know. You look at him like...

23:37.400 --> 23:39.080
I look at you with more desire.

23:51.200 --> 23:52.360
It's okay, see?

23:58.800 --> 24:00.560
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

24:04.760 --> 24:07.800
-That was repulsive.
-Excuse me?

24:07.880 --> 24:09.720
You and that tart.

24:09.800 --> 24:12.920
You make me gag.
You two are degenerates.

24:14.080 --> 24:16.080
I don't know what you're talking about.

24:28.000 --> 24:31.880
Stay away from my wife.
Don't call her again.

24:32.760 --> 24:34.800
Now do you know what I'm talking about?

24:36.280 --> 24:39.760
Never again.
I know you call her every morning.

24:39.840 --> 24:42.560
-You're a son of a bitch.
-I want you to do something else,

24:42.640 --> 24:47.160
or after the clock strikes midnight,
I'll tell everyone about your perversion.

24:49.720 --> 24:51.520
And what do you want?

24:52.600 --> 24:55.560
I want your bitch girlfriend
to put me forward

24:55.640 --> 24:59.200
as the only candidate
for the new technical director job.

24:59.920 --> 25:03.360
Since Uribe's been here,
she does what she pleases.

25:05.280 --> 25:06.880
I want that job now.

25:13.160 --> 25:15.600
-I hope you die.
-Out of my way.

25:18.200 --> 25:19.760
You only have a few hours.

25:29.160 --> 25:32.160
-What are you doing here?
-I came to talk to you.

25:34.280 --> 25:36.040
Get it through your head.

25:36.120 --> 25:38.000
What you and I had ended months ago.

25:38.080 --> 25:41.240
Yes, three months exactly.

25:42.320 --> 25:43.320
I'm pregnant.

25:50.920 --> 25:52.480
How do I know it's my kid?

25:53.800 --> 25:57.360
Of all the men in the company,
I choose the nastiest of all.

25:57.440 --> 25:59.800
What did you expect me to say?

25:59.880 --> 26:01.680
"That's great, honey! Don't worry.

26:01.760 --> 26:04.200
I'll leave my wife and daughter
and live with some nobody."

26:04.280 --> 26:06.240
I don't want a fairy tale with you.

26:08.400 --> 26:10.240
But this child is both of ours.

26:11.480 --> 26:13.520
Fine, Carolina. How much do you want?

26:15.040 --> 26:16.040
What?

26:16.120 --> 26:18.000
How much do you want to get rid of it?

26:19.360 --> 26:22.200
Mario, I'm not going to terminate
this pregnancy.

26:22.680 --> 26:24.880
Do you know
what a back-alley abortion involves?

26:26.280 --> 26:27.760
The risk it entails?

26:28.800 --> 26:30.680
You're on your own. Don't count on me.

26:34.560 --> 26:37.600
Well, I'm afraid
I am going to count on you.

26:39.040 --> 26:43.200
Especially because I'm out of a job
and I'll need money to raise the child.

26:43.880 --> 26:45.320
So it's up to you.

26:45.960 --> 26:48.520
Either give me a hefty sum
or I'll cause such a scandal

26:48.600 --> 26:50.720
that you'll lose your family and your job.

26:54.080 --> 26:56.360
-You've always been a bitch.
-Yes.

26:57.520 --> 26:59.280
You're right about that,

26:59.360 --> 27:02.200
but that's what you liked most about me.

27:23.120 --> 27:24.360
Good morning, Mr. Uribe.

27:24.440 --> 27:27.560
Miss Aguilar, my apologies.
We had to start early.

27:27.640 --> 27:30.800
The Cifuenteses have to leave soon
because of the auction.

27:30.880 --> 27:33.360
Carlos is showing me
a fascinating project.

27:33.440 --> 27:35.440
It's telephone booths.

27:35.520 --> 27:39.000
They'd be installed for public use
on the main streets of the big cities,

27:39.080 --> 27:41.040
so you can make a call at any time.

27:41.320 --> 27:42.640
Don't you think it's brilliant?

27:42.720 --> 27:47.000
They've been in other countries for years.
It's time to have them in Spain.

27:48.520 --> 27:50.200
That was my idea.

27:51.040 --> 27:53.200
You stole my project.

27:54.520 --> 27:56.720
You tricked me last night
to steal the idea.

27:56.800 --> 27:58.480
You're a cheat and a traitor!

27:58.560 --> 28:01.480
-I don't know what you mean.
-Last night?

28:01.560 --> 28:04.560
I won't allow this lack of respect
in my presence.

28:05.560 --> 28:08.800
Calm yourself, please, Miss Aguilar.

28:08.880 --> 28:11.520
That's what I'm saying.
A little respect and peace.

28:11.600 --> 28:13.280
You'd think we were in a market.

28:13.360 --> 28:15.960
Doña Carmen, wait a moment
before pointing fingers.

28:16.040 --> 28:20.680
I personally saw
how my son worked all night

28:20.760 --> 28:22.400
to come and offer you this idea.

28:23.640 --> 28:25.040
That isn't true.

28:25.120 --> 28:27.400
Not only does she call my son a thief,

28:27.480 --> 28:30.320
she dares to call me a liar.

28:30.400 --> 28:33.720
Doña Carmen, for me,
it's one person's word against another's.

28:33.800 --> 28:37.240
-Mr. Uribe, I promise that I--
-Just a minute, Carlos.

28:37.320 --> 28:39.840
Now you'll have to prove

28:39.920 --> 28:43.440
which of you two
is the true creator of the project.

28:44.200 --> 28:46.800
How? By developing it further.

28:47.840 --> 28:51.000
You'll compete to defend your project.

28:51.080 --> 28:55.600
And the winner will become
the company director.

28:56.800 --> 28:58.520
That's crazy.

28:59.320 --> 29:01.720
You’re still in time to withdraw,
Mr. Cifuentes.

29:01.800 --> 29:04.680
In that case, I'll start working
immediately with Miss Aguilar.

29:04.760 --> 29:06.000
That's ridiculous.

29:06.080 --> 29:09.960
Please don't take
this company's future so lightly.

29:10.520 --> 29:13.480
This young lady is totally incompetent.

29:13.560 --> 29:17.080
You'd be surprised to learn
where I come from, Doña Carmen.

29:18.600 --> 29:19.760
Very well.

29:20.760 --> 29:22.280
May the best person win.

29:26.880 --> 29:27.880
Carlos!

29:33.360 --> 29:34.360
How could you?

29:37.240 --> 29:39.440
-Everything last night...
-...was a lie.

29:39.920 --> 29:41.800
An eye for an eye,

29:41.880 --> 29:43.560
a tooth for a tooth.

29:44.440 --> 29:46.040
How could you?

29:46.120 --> 29:49.360
Seduce you and then steal from you?

29:50.880 --> 29:53.320
Are you really asking me that, Lidia?

29:53.800 --> 29:55.520
You're the expert.

30:00.160 --> 30:03.080
If I lose my job,
it'll be on your conscience.

30:03.160 --> 30:05.920
I don't care
that Francisco now works a car factory.

30:06.720 --> 30:08.760
I won't care if you're fired.

30:12.120 --> 30:14.000
Don't forget this.

30:16.960 --> 30:19.480
You have become a despicable person.

30:55.120 --> 30:58.800
Hey, what are you doing?
Our shift isn't over for half an hour.

30:58.880 --> 31:01.840
You're not the boss, newbie.
Mind your own business.

31:03.040 --> 31:06.400
It's my business if I have to stay
an extra hour to fix your shoddy work.

31:06.480 --> 31:07.680
Shoddy work?

31:14.160 --> 31:15.920
Francisco! Stop!

31:17.520 --> 31:18.640
That's enough!

31:24.600 --> 31:28.360
What were you thinking?
Fighting like kids.

31:29.200 --> 31:31.080
Welcome to the real world.

31:31.160 --> 31:33.480
Didn't take you long
to get used to the good life.

31:38.360 --> 31:39.640
Why did you come?

31:42.040 --> 31:43.400
To find you.

31:48.040 --> 31:50.240
I didn't know you were working here.

31:53.240 --> 31:55.280
In fact, I thought you'd be in...

31:56.080 --> 31:59.080
Do you realize your return
meant the end of my life?

32:01.560 --> 32:04.040
Do you realize I ruined my marriage,

32:04.120 --> 32:06.760
I lost my brother, my best friend?

32:08.120 --> 32:12.040
I gambled on you and lost everything.

32:12.120 --> 32:13.400
Everything.

32:14.560 --> 32:15.800
So, tell me...

32:17.360 --> 32:18.960
why are you here?

32:19.040 --> 32:21.800
I have to develop a project
for the company.

32:23.880 --> 32:25.560
And I can't do it alone.

32:26.640 --> 32:30.160
I need your experience,
your knowledge of the company...

32:32.440 --> 32:34.200
to compete with Carlos.

32:41.280 --> 32:43.840
Come to the New Year's
charity auction tonight.

32:48.040 --> 32:50.480
We can start over again.

32:54.480 --> 32:56.120
I'm very sorry...

32:57.120 --> 33:00.360
if it's been so terrible to see me again.

33:01.200 --> 33:02.520
I'm sorry.

33:30.840 --> 33:31.840
Hello, Don Mario.

33:33.440 --> 33:34.840
Do you need something?

33:37.080 --> 33:38.600
Money, Pablito.

33:39.360 --> 33:40.880
You and me both.

33:41.600 --> 33:44.480
A few bundles like that
and you'd be set for life.

33:44.560 --> 33:48.240
Well, we'll have to work very hard
to get one of these.

33:48.720 --> 33:50.160
Pablo, you have to come.

33:50.240 --> 33:51.280
-Hello.
-Hello, sweetheart.

33:51.360 --> 33:53.520
Come on. It's just a minute.

33:54.680 --> 33:56.680
-Give me a second.
-It can't wait.

34:00.920 --> 34:02.000
What is it?

34:02.080 --> 34:04.200
Sara has promoted me
for the auction tonight.

34:06.040 --> 34:07.440
Aren't you happy?

34:07.520 --> 34:11.120
Of course. The thing is I’m still mad.
Remember I was angry at you?

34:11.199 --> 34:14.639
Yes, and you were right to be.

34:16.239 --> 34:18.000
-I was a witch.
-Yes.

34:26.520 --> 34:29.120
I know that man is important to you

34:29.199 --> 34:31.560
and doing this will make you feel better.

34:33.000 --> 34:34.600
That's true.

34:35.640 --> 34:37.280
So I trust you.

34:44.320 --> 34:46.040
Don Mario! Help!

34:46.600 --> 34:49.239
Don Mario! Don Mario!
Are you all right?

34:49.880 --> 34:53.000
I'm fine. I just felt dizzy.

34:53.760 --> 34:56.400
You don't look well. You need a doctor.

35:00.120 --> 35:01.520
Mario, what happened?

35:01.600 --> 35:03.520
The company called me. What happened?

35:03.600 --> 35:06.240
Calm down, ma'am. You can get dressed.

35:11.680 --> 35:12.560
Sit down, please.

35:22.920 --> 35:26.120
From our analysis,
everything points to poisoning.

35:27.440 --> 35:29.640
But given the seriousness
of your symptoms,

35:29.720 --> 35:31.320
it isn't a one-off thing.

35:31.400 --> 35:35.040
You may have been in contact
with this toxic product for some time.

35:35.520 --> 35:36.920
Excuse me.

35:38.040 --> 35:40.840
What toxic product? I don't understand.

35:40.920 --> 35:43.840
Well, it happens more often
than you think.

35:43.920 --> 35:47.960
Some foods can be contaminated
by their containers if you're not careful.

35:48.040 --> 35:51.040
Or you've been in contact
with a toxic product,

35:51.120 --> 35:54.640
like rat poison, insecticide or chemicals.

35:54.720 --> 35:57.680
If after being in contact
with one of these products

35:57.760 --> 36:01.040
you put your hand to your mouth,
you could be poisoned.

36:02.440 --> 36:03.840
I guess that was it.

36:03.920 --> 36:05.480
What do I need to do?

36:05.960 --> 36:07.920
We're going to give you oxygen.

36:08.680 --> 36:10.600
But you must change your habits.

36:10.680 --> 36:13.280
The cyanide will leave your blood
with time.

36:13.360 --> 36:15.040
But it's very important

36:15.120 --> 36:17.760
to check your surroundings
so this doesn't keep happening.

36:22.120 --> 36:24.640
And take these vitamins.
They'll help you recover.

36:24.720 --> 36:26.160
Thank you, Doctor.

36:28.640 --> 36:29.840
Thank you.

36:29.920 --> 36:32.360
And that's all. Take care and get better.

36:36.360 --> 36:40.240
-When we get home, I'll check everything.
-That's fine.

36:48.200 --> 36:52.440
I'm sorry if it's been so terrible
to see me again.

36:53.560 --> 36:55.000
I bet on you

36:55.920 --> 36:57.160
and I lost everything.

36:57.240 --> 36:58.200
Get out.

37:01.320 --> 37:03.000
You lied to us.

37:03.080 --> 37:07.240
You let them take the company from us,
and you've broken my daughter's heart,

37:07.320 --> 37:10.840
and all for a two-bit thief,
for that wretch.

37:11.640 --> 37:15.120
Doña Carmen,
nothing happened between Lidia and me.

37:15.720 --> 37:18.280
You have an hour to gather your things.

37:18.360 --> 37:21.520
Elisa is my wife and this is my home.

37:21.600 --> 37:23.600
You are no longer part of this family.

37:23.680 --> 37:27.680
If you have even a shred of honor left,
you won't cause us any more grief.

37:27.760 --> 37:28.640
Get out.

37:56.200 --> 37:57.920
Not one post is to be left vacant.

37:58.000 --> 38:02.400
If you need to go to the bathroom,
have someone ready to take your place.

38:02.480 --> 38:06.320
We mustn't miss a single call.
Nothing can go wrong tonight.

38:06.400 --> 38:09.000
We have to beat last year's record.

38:09.080 --> 38:12.320
And remember, Marga will be
coordinating all the operations.

38:13.160 --> 38:14.360
Good luck, everyone.

38:15.880 --> 38:17.520
Are you all right?

38:17.600 --> 38:19.320
Yes, it's just nerves.

38:24.680 --> 38:28.240
Come on, Marga. Everything will go well.

38:28.320 --> 38:29.720
Will everything go wrong?

38:29.800 --> 38:30.960
What are you doing here?

38:31.040 --> 38:33.640
-Don't be a worrywart. I'm nervous enough.
-Come here.

38:37.040 --> 38:38.320
What's going on?

38:38.400 --> 38:39.560
-What's going on?
-Yes.

38:39.640 --> 38:41.760
I'm missing an entire stack of bills.

38:41.840 --> 38:44.600
Marga, 5,000 pesetas!

38:44.680 --> 38:46.800
It must be a mistake. You miscounted.

38:46.880 --> 38:48.280
It's not a mistake.

38:48.360 --> 38:51.800
I've counted over and over,
and it doesn't add up.

38:51.880 --> 38:54.200
All right. Let's calm down.

38:54.280 --> 38:57.600
I have to concentrate on the auction now.

38:57.680 --> 39:01.040
Just wait until afterwards
and we'll count it together.

39:01.120 --> 39:03.920
-You'll see, it'll turn up.
-I think it was stolen.

39:04.000 --> 39:05.880
-Who would do that?
-Don Mario...

39:06.480 --> 39:08.840
You can’t accuse someone like that,
without proof.

39:08.920 --> 39:10.080
That’s not how it works!

39:10.160 --> 39:14.040
-Imagine someone accused you of theft!
-I haven't done anything.

39:14.120 --> 39:15.760
Listen.

39:15.840 --> 39:18.120
I saw how he was looking at it.

39:18.200 --> 39:19.560
You have to trust me.

39:19.640 --> 39:22.560
He came up and touched it.
"Pablito, money, money."

39:22.640 --> 39:26.240
All right,
but even if someone took that money,

39:26.320 --> 39:28.040
we can't do anything about it now.

39:28.120 --> 39:31.880
So, please, trust me and tomorrow morning
I'll count it with you.

39:34.080 --> 39:36.640
Promise me
you won't do anything until then.

39:38.920 --> 39:41.120
Give me a kiss. Wish me luck.

39:43.240 --> 39:44.720
Good luck, pumpkin!

39:52.160 --> 39:54.400
Miss Aguilar.

39:54.480 --> 39:56.200
You look beautiful.

39:56.680 --> 40:00.080
Mr. Uribe, I'd like to contribute
something to the auction.

40:01.280 --> 40:03.240
It's a very valuable jewel.

40:03.320 --> 40:06.720
Few women could dream of having
such a precious jewel.

40:06.800 --> 40:10.920
I'm speechless. It will be a pleasure
to include it with the other items.

40:11.000 --> 40:12.600
It's a lovely gesture.

40:12.680 --> 40:15.200
I hope you aren't trying
to bribe me with this,

40:15.280 --> 40:17.600
because I'll be hard on projects.

40:17.680 --> 40:21.240
Miss Aguilar,
you know where everything goes.

40:21.320 --> 40:25.040
Would you be kind enough
to put this in a bell jar

40:25.120 --> 40:26.520
along with the other items?

40:27.840 --> 40:29.600
Of course, Mr. Uribe.

40:29.680 --> 40:33.240
And tell us its auction number.
We don't want it getting lost on the way.

40:33.960 --> 40:37.360
Doña Carmen, how is your daughter?

40:37.440 --> 40:40.880
Much better, thank you.
God willing, she'll be home tomorrow.

40:40.960 --> 40:42.040
I'm delighted.

40:57.680 --> 40:59.440
It looks lovely!

41:01.800 --> 41:03.160
Are you feeling better?

41:04.120 --> 41:06.120
Yes. I'm going to the washroom.

41:15.440 --> 41:18.400
CANDIDATES FOR TECHNICAL DIRECTOR

41:38.800 --> 41:39.800
Ángeles!

41:40.560 --> 41:41.440
Ángeles!

41:41.520 --> 41:42.760
This is wonderful!

41:43.800 --> 41:47.360
-We've missed you.
-Yes, and I've missed you.

41:47.440 --> 41:48.600
Are you all right?

41:49.280 --> 41:52.080
Yes, even better now I'm here.

41:53.680 --> 41:55.200
I'm sorry I hung up on you.

41:56.000 --> 41:58.320
Don't worry.
We're here for whatever you need.

41:59.720 --> 42:03.040
Everyone to their posts.
The auction is about to begin.

42:03.120 --> 42:05.120
-We'll see you later.
-Ángeles.

42:05.600 --> 42:07.000
How are you?

42:07.960 --> 42:09.120
I'm fine.

42:10.280 --> 42:13.360
I'll go now.
I don't want to be in the way.

42:33.200 --> 42:37.000
Ladies and gentlemen, it's a great honor
for me to be hosting

42:37.080 --> 42:39.080
this charity auction once again.

42:39.160 --> 42:43.200
As you all know, the presidency
of the company is now held

42:43.280 --> 42:47.200
by Mr. Uribe, whom I want
to thank personally tonight

42:47.280 --> 42:49.960
for continuing to believe
in this foundation

42:50.040 --> 42:53.320
which does so much
to help widows in this country.

42:53.400 --> 42:56.240
And I thank you for being here tonight

42:56.320 --> 42:59.520
and contributing
with your donations to this auction.

42:59.600 --> 43:04.000
The pieces we have this year are
more valuable than in previous editions.

43:04.080 --> 43:07.280
So this is a lovely way to start the year.

43:07.360 --> 43:10.000
And with that, enjoy yourselves and...

43:10.960 --> 43:14.160
The lines are open. Let the auction begin.

44:14.360 --> 44:15.880
Get me another drink.

44:39.000 --> 44:40.680
What are you doing?

44:50.120 --> 44:51.760
I can't take it anymore.

44:54.680 --> 44:59.480
He hits me. He insults me.
He threatens to take my daughter away.

45:02.560 --> 45:06.960
Lidia, I have to kill him
before he kills me.

45:12.720 --> 45:14.400
This is madness.

46:03.600 --> 46:06.920
-What are you doing?
-I'm sorry. It was an accident.

46:08.920 --> 46:10.760
This is no time for arguments.

46:16.000 --> 46:17.840
You're a bitch.

46:23.040 --> 46:26.400
Miss Aguilar, are you leaving
before we know how much we raised?

46:27.520 --> 46:29.000
Thank you, everyone.

46:29.080 --> 46:34.680
Once again, something tells me
that this year will be record-breaking.

46:37.160 --> 46:38.400
Yes, indeed.

46:38.480 --> 46:42.360
Here I have the total which amounts to...

46:43.280 --> 46:45.720
130,000 pesetas.

46:48.080 --> 46:49.960
I know Carlos' drink was meant for me.

46:50.040 --> 46:51.480
No! Mario, no!

46:51.560 --> 46:54.960
Thank you all for your collaboration,

46:55.040 --> 46:57.600
but especially the girls,

46:57.680 --> 47:01.400
because thanks to them,
everything went impeccably well.

47:01.480 --> 47:04.000
Ladies, come out and take a bow.

47:17.400 --> 47:19.880
-Please, I'm begging you!
-You're poisoning me!

47:19.960 --> 47:22.560
I'm begging you, please. I'm begging you.

47:22.640 --> 47:25.400
-Since when?
-I'm begging you, please!

47:25.480 --> 47:28.760
-Mario, please!
-Since when?

47:28.840 --> 47:32.040
Please, Mario, for our daughter!

47:32.120 --> 47:35.600
Tell me the truth,
or I swear I'll kill you!

47:35.680 --> 47:37.000
Tell me the truth!

47:39.320 --> 47:40.480
I hate you.

47:40.560 --> 47:43.160
Being with you is like being dead.

47:44.560 --> 47:48.280
-Where did he take her?
-I don't know, but there's no time. Hurry!

47:57.600 --> 48:00.560
I bid for the ring,
as you asked me, Don Carlos.

48:00.640 --> 48:04.640
Perfect. Remember, no one must know
that I was the buyer.

48:07.440 --> 48:08.600
Stop!

48:20.640 --> 48:22.120
What are you doing here?

48:23.480 --> 48:25.360
I've come to help you destroy Lidia.

48:41.960 --> 48:44.360
Just minutes into the new year,

48:44.440 --> 48:46.480
and the promise of getting away

48:46.560 --> 48:49.480
from the dark world to which I'd belonged
was up in smoke.

48:49.560 --> 48:51.840
The challenge would now be greater...

48:51.920 --> 48:55.600
and the four of us would struggle together
to navigate our destiny.
