00:32.530 --> 00:35.439
Sorry, I guess I have a problem
expressing myself verbally.

00:36.130 --> 00:37.500
I struggle with it.

00:37.929 --> 00:38.939
You stood me up.

00:39.729 --> 00:41.829
You were gonna come to
the station, remember?

00:42.130 --> 00:43.140
I forgot?

00:45.130 --> 00:46.850
Not something a girl likes to hear.

00:47.530 --> 00:50.719
So we'll skip the informal invitation
and do the more formal thing.

00:51.130 --> 00:55.310
You have the right to remain silent,
but I wouldn't recommend it.

00:56.530 --> 00:58.560
Look at the pictures.
I looked at them.

00:58.929 --> 01:00.890
- What's in the pictures?
- Me and Little Tony.

01:01.929 --> 01:04.420
I don't know where he is.
How long are we gonna do this?

01:04.930 --> 01:08.340
So you haven't seen him since
the day this picture was taken?

01:10.930 --> 01:14.340
The day County Supervisor Caffrey
was found murdered.

01:15.129 --> 01:16.780
I heard it was a suicide.

01:19.329 --> 01:20.629
Caffrey shot himself?

01:21.129 --> 01:22.530
- It happens.
- In back of the head?

01:22.930 --> 01:25.599
And he locked himself
in the trunk of his car?

01:26.530 --> 01:28.109
He'd been depressed.

01:30.730 --> 01:32.269
Where's Little Tony?

01:33.730 --> 01:37.280
Burbank. Stockholm. The planet
Mongo. I have no idea where he is!

01:37.930 --> 01:39.890
Losing patience with this crap.

01:41.530 --> 01:43.810
I'm not. I'm just getting started.

01:44.530 --> 01:47.060
I had a big breakfast.
I could do this all day.

01:47.530 --> 01:48.930
Doesn't she ever have to pee?

01:49.930 --> 01:52.560
Fine. You want to play all day,
play with yourself.

01:52.930 --> 01:56.189
You charge me or get me gone
because I'm telling you nothing.

01:58.329 --> 01:59.730
Look at the pictures.

02:00.730 --> 02:01.780
Bite me.

02:02.530 --> 02:03.540
Where is he?

02:05.530 --> 02:06.859
Kate, Kate.

02:17.530 --> 02:19.280
- Sorry.
- Yeah, well...

02:19.330 --> 02:21.539
...we should've gotten
you out hours ago.

02:22.930 --> 02:25.840
- He's not gonna talk.
- Then Little Tony is good as gone.

02:26.530 --> 02:29.439
We can't find him,
then I don't know anyone who can.

02:40.930 --> 02:41.770
It's about time!

02:42.729 --> 02:45.639
Not a lot of enchanted
swordsmiths open on Sunday.

02:50.530 --> 02:52.210
Cut off all limbs and both heads.

02:52.930 --> 02:56.689
Remember to bury the parts separately.
I don't want it coming back to life.

02:57.729 --> 02:58.889
That's it?

03:00.129 --> 03:03.389
I'm gonna go clean out the nests.
I'll see you back at the office.

03:08.530 --> 03:11.229
Am I wrong in thinking that
a "please" and "thank you"...

03:11.530 --> 03:15.250
...is generally considered good form
when requesting a dismemberment?

03:15.729 --> 03:18.469
He appreciates us in his
own unappreciative way.

03:19.930 --> 03:21.300
You know what I think?

03:21.729 --> 03:24.919
I think he uses his tortured
creature-of-the-night status...

03:25.330 --> 03:27.400
...as license to be
rude and insensitive.

03:28.330 --> 03:30.719
Sure, he's polite to
the helpless and downtrodden.

03:31.330 --> 03:35.090
But he ignores the people that are
closest to him, who matter the most.

03:35.530 --> 03:37.039
Can you say "clueless"?

04:26.689 --> 04:29.569
Does giant tentacle spew
come out with dry cleaning?

04:30.290 --> 04:32.459
- Good, you're back. You need to--
- No!

04:33.889 --> 04:37.720
I don't care what's about to happen.
Asteroids are hurtling towards Earth.

04:38.689 --> 04:41.459
Unspeakable evil is rising in
the San Fernando Valley.

04:41.689 --> 04:44.459
Jar Jar is getting his
own talk show. Whatever.

04:45.290 --> 04:48.199
I don't want to hear about it.
Not until you ask us how it went.

04:48.889 --> 04:52.050
Call your mom back. She phoned,
saying she'd like to speak with you.

04:53.089 --> 04:54.949
And what are you talking about?

04:55.490 --> 04:58.370
You do remember leaving us in
a sewer with a giant calamari?

04:59.089 --> 05:03.129
Yeah, and you're both here,
so I assume it went okay, right?

05:04.490 --> 05:07.579
Yeah, it went okay. Of
course it went okay. Okay?

05:08.089 --> 05:11.110
- That's not the point!
- So there is a point?

05:11.689 --> 05:16.149
It is possible to brood and show
interest in the feelings of others.

05:19.490 --> 05:22.610
She thinks you're insensitive,
and not to bring up the irony...

05:23.089 --> 05:24.769
...but consider the source.

05:25.490 --> 05:27.069
I'm reserved. I do care.

05:27.889 --> 05:30.170
- It's like you don't have a pulse.
- I don't.

05:30.889 --> 05:33.310
Spend a little time listening to
how the living interact.

05:34.490 --> 05:36.029
- Kate.
- Angel.

05:36.889 --> 05:38.779
- Got a minute?
- Sure.

05:41.689 --> 05:43.370
- Coffee?
- I'm fine.

05:50.089 --> 05:53.110
Mr. and Mrs. Spock
need to mind meld now.

05:54.889 --> 05:58.860
His name's Tony Papazian. Street
name, Little Tony. He's a bad guy.

05:59.689 --> 06:02.779
We have an indictment against him
for a county supervisor's murder.

06:03.889 --> 06:06.560
One problem: We don't know
where to send the subpoena.

06:06.889 --> 06:07.939
You can't find him.

06:08.089 --> 06:11.319
He's still in the city,
but all my sources are dry.

06:12.889 --> 06:15.629
- Want me to look into it?
- I'll pay for whatever you can get.

06:15.889 --> 06:17.639
- I owe you a favor--
- This isn't a favor.

06:18.290 --> 06:20.009
It's a job. That's how we do it.

06:20.689 --> 06:23.250
- This number is my direct line.
- All right.

06:23.689 --> 06:25.550
Time's a factor.
Tony plans to skip town.

06:26.089 --> 06:26.959
Got it.

06:27.290 --> 06:30.980
Find him, you call me. Nothing more.
You cannot be a part of this.

06:31.490 --> 06:34.370
You don't want a reputation for
going outside the department?

06:35.089 --> 06:38.000
I don't want to get a reputation
for getting you killed.

06:51.889 --> 06:52.800
Anything?

06:53.089 --> 06:55.689
Plenty on Papazian.
Known acquaintances, hangouts.

06:56.089 --> 06:57.839
But the cops have
already been over all this.

06:58.490 --> 07:00.279
Yeah, but we haven't.

07:02.689 --> 07:07.040
Cordelia, I wanted to, you know,
thank you so much...

07:08.089 --> 07:10.509
...for going through
those coroner reports...

07:11.089 --> 07:15.269
...because I can imagine how
not fun it is to read about...

07:15.889 --> 07:18.350
...you know, coroner stuff.

07:19.490 --> 07:20.889
Lame.

07:23.689 --> 07:25.300
- What do you got?
- The weebies.

07:25.490 --> 07:27.769
This guy clearly has
anger management issues.

07:28.490 --> 07:30.170
Victims and victim parts washing up...

07:30.889 --> 07:33.589
...all over the
Southern California Coast.

07:35.089 --> 07:37.230
Long Beach, San Pedro, Carlsbad.

07:37.490 --> 07:39.209
Pull up the tidal flow charts.

07:39.889 --> 07:42.490
- Match them up to the murder dates.
- Tides?

07:42.889 --> 07:45.100
You think this guy has a
primary dumping ground?

07:45.889 --> 07:47.540
Do the victims come
from the same spot?

07:48.290 --> 07:50.079
Somewhere Little Tony feels safe.

07:54.050 --> 07:56.120
- Daddy.
- Katie!

07:56.449 --> 07:58.550
I saw you. Were you
planning on saying hi?

07:58.850 --> 08:00.529
Well, I figured you're working.

08:01.250 --> 08:05.180
I'm not here very long, just dropping
off some pension forms up in records.

08:06.649 --> 08:09.879
If you think you got red tape
on the job, wait'll you retire.

08:11.449 --> 08:14.189
Harlan says they're throwing you
a sendoff at the Blue Bar.

08:15.050 --> 08:17.790
Just the guys looking to give
me a hard time, not a big deal.

08:18.649 --> 08:21.040
He said I should say something,
just a few words...

08:21.649 --> 08:24.110
...to mark the occasion,
seeing as you're my father.

08:25.250 --> 08:26.480
That'd be fine.

08:28.250 --> 08:29.649
Don't go to any trouble.

08:30.649 --> 08:31.910
It's no trouble, really.

08:34.850 --> 08:37.940
- Detective, you got a call on 229.
- Thanks.

08:38.450 --> 08:40.269
- I guess I'd better....
- Yeah.

08:48.649 --> 08:49.519
Lockley.

08:50.450 --> 08:54.000
8843 Hyperion Way,
right off pier 39, San Pedro.

08:54.649 --> 08:55.950
You found him, You're sure?

08:56.450 --> 09:00.350
Mack's Salvage Depot, northwest side.
Got some muscle on hand.

09:01.250 --> 09:03.000
I'm on my way.
Just get out of there.

09:26.129 --> 09:27.139
Damn it.

09:32.730 --> 09:35.049
- And don't forget to water my plants.
- Sure thing.

09:35.730 --> 09:38.259
And talk to them.
They like that.

09:42.929 --> 09:44.159
Hi.

09:44.730 --> 09:46.620
This is exciting.
I love boat trips.

09:47.129 --> 09:48.850
- Who's the mook?
- Herb Saunders.

09:49.529 --> 09:51.460
- It's Herb Saunders.
- The freeways here.

09:51.929 --> 09:54.320
I've been driving all day,
but the brochure did say:

09:54.929 --> 09:56.470
"Boats leaving every two hours."

09:57.330 --> 09:58.799
I think you're still lost.

09:59.129 --> 10:00.360
- Is that to Catalina?
- No.

10:00.929 --> 10:02.720
I could've sworn
the ticket said pier 39.

10:03.330 --> 10:04.409
It's here, I had it.

10:04.529 --> 10:07.059
- Get out of here.
- Benny, I don't like that guy.

10:07.529 --> 10:09.629
Is it the hat?
I knew it was too much.

10:17.129 --> 10:18.570
Hi, Tony.

10:31.529 --> 10:34.129
Which part of "Get out of there"
gave you trouble?

10:34.529 --> 10:36.000
He was getting away.

10:36.330 --> 10:40.090
So you dressed like a road flare
and put my ass and yours on the line?

10:42.330 --> 10:45.840
Look, just go. I'll figure out
something to tell my lieutenant.

11:02.730 --> 11:04.169
I want my phone call.

11:04.529 --> 11:08.429
Gotta cancel the suite in Yerevan?
Think you can get your deposit back?

11:09.330 --> 11:13.330
You've been running after me for a
long time, haven't you, sweetheart?

11:14.730 --> 11:18.450
If I'd known how bad you wanted me,
I might've had you catch me sooner.

11:19.529 --> 11:21.629
If I knew how much you
needed the exercise...

11:21.929 --> 11:24.070
...I might've let you
run a little longer.

11:29.730 --> 11:31.309
- Wolfram and Hart,
- Lee Mercer,

11:32.129 --> 11:35.639
Yes, Mr. Papazian, we're already
well aware of the situation.

11:36.330 --> 11:38.679
And are you aware I got
a certain thorn in my side?

11:39.330 --> 11:42.350
Oh, yes, we understand
the factors very clearly.

11:42.929 --> 11:46.690
And I think I can say with confidence,
that thorn is about to be removed.

11:48.330 --> 11:49.730
Permanently.

11:52.289 --> 11:56.259
Here is our petition to transfer
our client out of this precinct.

11:57.090 --> 11:58.879
- What for?
- For his own safety, lieutenant.

11:59.490 --> 12:01.490
Afraid to stay with us?
Need a nightlight?

12:01.889 --> 12:04.309
You got a pretty mouth.
Hate to see it get broken.

12:05.490 --> 12:06.889
I want that stricken.

12:07.289 --> 12:09.429
He's under great stress
from abuse suffered...

12:09.690 --> 12:12.220
...at the hands of your officers and
an unnamed assailant...

12:13.289 --> 12:15.750
...we believe was with
Detective Lockley at the arrest.

12:16.289 --> 12:18.500
- I wouldn't know.
- I saw you talking to him.

12:18.690 --> 12:20.940
Before or after you
murdered Caffrey, you fat--

12:21.690 --> 12:24.600
- That's enough.
- Enter her verbal abuse in the record.

12:25.289 --> 12:26.870
That too.

12:27.690 --> 12:29.690
Mr. Papazian's rights
will be respected--

12:30.090 --> 12:32.159
Mr. Papazian is a
very important client.

12:33.090 --> 12:35.970
Any violation of his rights
and there will be repercussions.

12:36.690 --> 12:39.529
- What does that mean?
- I'll open the case to public opinion.

12:40.289 --> 12:42.389
We'll shine a light
on this precinct...

12:43.289 --> 12:45.679
...and give people a view of the
brutality of the police...

12:45.690 --> 12:48.039
...that'll make Mark Fuhrman
look like Gentle Ben.

12:48.690 --> 12:51.179
Everybody should have
a lawyer like this one.

12:54.690 --> 12:57.990
How nice is it to finally have a
simple find-the-crime-lord case?

12:58.889 --> 13:00.750
Over and done with.

13:02.490 --> 13:03.470
Yeah.

13:05.490 --> 13:08.610
Wait. You've got pensive face.

13:09.090 --> 13:11.620
- I've always got pensive face.
- "Pensiv-er" face.

13:12.690 --> 13:14.370
I'm not sure this is over with.

13:14.490 --> 13:17.049
- There's something about Little Tony.
- What something?

13:19.289 --> 13:21.149
I don't know, just a feeling I got.

13:25.289 --> 13:26.299
- What?
- Nothing.

13:26.490 --> 13:29.750
I just find it fascinating how your
instincts are so highly attuned...

13:30.690 --> 13:34.169
...when it comes to boring old evil,
but you have yet to make mention...

13:34.889 --> 13:36.539
...of these new shoes.

13:39.690 --> 13:43.659
Look, Cordelia, women's shoes--
Men, they just don't--

13:44.490 --> 13:45.889
Great shoes. New?

13:46.289 --> 13:48.289
You were right.
He's planning something.

13:48.690 --> 13:51.360
- What'd you hear?
- Papazian's planning something.

13:52.289 --> 13:53.940
- That's it?
- Johnny Red says, quote:

13:54.090 --> 13:56.190
- "Papazian's planning something."
- I thought so.

13:57.090 --> 13:58.350
You were right.

14:00.409 --> 14:03.080
- Home run, Lockley.
- Way to go.

14:04.009 --> 14:05.450
Nice work, Lockley.

14:07.009 --> 14:08.970
No, your dad paid for the drink.

14:14.809 --> 14:16.000
Tony Papazian, huh?

14:17.210 --> 14:18.190
Yeah.

14:19.009 --> 14:22.450
- Well, congratulations.
- Thanks.

14:23.210 --> 14:26.330
Hope the bust doesn't fall apart
before you file the paperwork.

14:27.409 --> 14:29.019
Damn lawyers, huh?

14:29.809 --> 14:30.860
Yeah.

14:31.610 --> 14:33.639
- Harlan.
- You see this?

14:39.409 --> 14:41.690
- Sensitivity training?
- Everyone has to take it.

14:42.409 --> 14:44.690
It's because of what
you did to Papazian.

14:45.409 --> 14:47.059
What I did?

14:47.809 --> 14:49.419
Somebody's gonna answer for this.

14:50.210 --> 14:52.279
- Will they make us hug?
- I'm not hugging you.

14:52.610 --> 14:56.470
Glad I'm getting out. In my day,
we didn't need any damn sensitivity.

14:58.610 --> 15:01.730
I'm guessing not too many of
you want to be here right now.

15:02.809 --> 15:05.129
Quick show of hands.
Who actually wants to be here?

15:05.210 --> 15:07.559
Well, I'm not gonna waste your time.

15:08.210 --> 15:10.629
What I am gonna do
is give you some tools...

15:11.210 --> 15:14.539
...to help you experience
the full range of human emotions.

15:15.409 --> 15:18.009
Learning that won't just
make you better people...

15:19.009 --> 15:22.129
...it'll help you diffuse
volatile situations in the field.

15:22.610 --> 15:25.169
It'll allow you to manage
some of your aggression...

15:25.610 --> 15:27.610
...so you won't feel
so tired all the time.

15:28.610 --> 15:31.659
In short, it'll make you better cops.

15:32.809 --> 15:36.179
One of the tools we use is this.

15:37.610 --> 15:41.049
It's called a Talking Stick.
I know, it sounds silly.

15:41.210 --> 15:43.909
But it works if you give it a chance.

15:44.809 --> 15:47.440
It's our contract with each other.

15:48.409 --> 15:52.980
Whoever holds this has the freedom
to express himself completely...

15:53.809 --> 15:57.570
...without judgment, within
the confines of this room.

15:58.610 --> 15:59.659
Heath?

16:04.009 --> 16:06.009
- I don't think so.
- Go ahead, give it a try.

16:10.009 --> 16:14.259
Now, why don't you start by telling
us something about your family?

16:14.809 --> 16:17.440
How you grew up. Any siblings?

16:18.409 --> 16:20.159
- Six brothers.
- And what was that like?

16:20.809 --> 16:22.600
I learned to hit back pretty quick.

16:25.009 --> 16:27.220
Your brothers went
kind of hard on you, huh?

16:28.610 --> 16:30.120
Where were your parents?

16:31.009 --> 16:33.679
It was just my mom.
She did the best she could.

16:35.210 --> 16:39.460
So you had to get tough right out of
the gate. Shut down your emotions.

16:41.210 --> 16:45.529
It's okay. You have our
permission to be honest.

16:47.210 --> 16:50.690
Is there something that you always
wanted to say to your mother...

16:51.409 --> 16:52.779
...but never could?

16:55.009 --> 16:56.620
"Will you marry me?"

17:05.809 --> 17:09.250
Kate, you'd like to share
something? We'd like to hear it.

17:10.009 --> 17:12.289
- No, I don't really.
- Afraid?

17:19.009 --> 17:22.200
Genuine emotion makes you
uncomfortable. That's okay.

17:22.608 --> 17:25.940
Your inappropriate
sarcasm masks anger.

17:27.410 --> 17:29.619
And do you know what anger is, Kate?

17:31.609 --> 17:33.119
It's just fear.

17:33.410 --> 17:36.779
Fear of being hurt. Fear of loss.

17:37.609 --> 17:42.140
You've been hurt, haven't you, Kate?
And you're afraid of being hurt again.

17:43.609 --> 17:45.259
Who are you afraid is gonna hurt you?

17:47.210 --> 17:48.190
Hell if I know,

17:48.609 --> 17:50.750
But you told me you
heard something, right?

17:53.410 --> 17:55.480
Planning something,
that's all I heard.

17:55.809 --> 17:57.349
And who'd you hear it from?

17:57.609 --> 18:00.559
Guys who work for Little Tony.
They're in my spinning class.

18:01.210 --> 18:04.049
- What did they say?
- They weren't actually talking to me.

18:04.809 --> 18:07.230
They were talking to some
guys in Brancato's crew.

18:07.809 --> 18:10.759
I overheard on account of
they had to shout over the bikes.

18:11.410 --> 18:13.660
- And all these guys are at your gym?
- Yeah.

18:14.410 --> 18:16.339
You got some kind of
thug special there?

18:16.809 --> 18:19.369
No, but if you want to
sign up, I get a discount.

18:19.809 --> 18:21.700
Look, guys. What was said?

18:22.210 --> 18:25.369
Right. Izzy's boys, they say to
Little Tony's crew...

18:26.410 --> 18:28.869
...now LT's in jail, they gotta
look for new employment.

18:29.410 --> 18:33.380
But LT's guys say no, because no stupid
bitch is gonna get the best of LT.

18:34.210 --> 18:37.019
- Know what that means?
- I think it stands for "Little Tony."

18:37.809 --> 18:39.319
It means he's going after Kate.

18:45.609 --> 18:46.809
- Angel.
- We need to talk.

18:46.809 --> 18:49.130
I know. I want to
apologize for the other night.

18:49.809 --> 18:50.720
You don't have to.

18:51.009 --> 18:53.109
That's not what my
sensitivity trainer says.

18:54.009 --> 18:58.079
I know, it's pretty goofball, right?
Still, thanks for what you did.

19:00.009 --> 19:00.880
You're welcome.

19:01.210 --> 19:03.559
What are you doing tomorrow
night, around 8-ish?

19:04.210 --> 19:07.720
My father's having this retirement
party with some of his cop buddies.

19:08.410 --> 19:10.269
I'm supposed to say a few words.

19:10.809 --> 19:14.849
It'd be nice if there was at least
one person there who wasn't armed.

19:16.210 --> 19:17.609
It'd be a favor.

19:18.609 --> 19:19.730
Sure.

19:21.009 --> 19:23.039
Okay, that was easy. I'm relieved.

19:24.609 --> 19:25.589
Is something wrong?

19:25.809 --> 19:29.390
- I think you may be in real danger.
- Okay, the relief part's done.

19:30.009 --> 19:33.869
I don't know the specifics yet, but
Papazian took a contract out on you.

19:34.809 --> 19:38.069
- Wow, he's really acting out.
- Well, yeah.

19:39.009 --> 19:40.660
- He wants you dead.
- I get that.

19:41.410 --> 19:44.740
I'm just saying he must be in pain
to strike out at others in that way.

19:45.609 --> 19:47.400
- Are you okay?
- God, listen to me.

19:48.009 --> 19:49.210
Suddenly I'm Dr. Laura.

19:49.210 --> 19:51.809
Soon I'll be talking
about my inner child.

19:54.009 --> 19:56.609
I'll be back to my usual level
of cynicism in no time.

19:57.609 --> 20:00.700
I'm sensing some tension.
I think you should tell me.

20:01.809 --> 20:03.490
What are you feeling?

20:04.210 --> 20:05.539
Concerned.

20:06.009 --> 20:09.029
We went to great effort and expense
to get you into that precinct.

20:10.210 --> 20:13.720
- Is it working?
- Of course it's working.

20:15.009 --> 20:19.579
After tomorrow's session,
you'll see results.

20:22.809 --> 20:24.700
Incredible results.

20:27.009 --> 20:29.220
That makes me feel all warm inside.

20:34.289 --> 20:36.180
That is so true, man!

20:48.690 --> 20:49.769
Boy, I'm scared.

20:51.089 --> 20:54.069
And excited.
And consumed with dread.

20:56.490 --> 20:57.750
And glad you're here.

20:58.289 --> 21:01.059
Little Tony's hired guns wouldn't
try something in a room of cops.

21:01.289 --> 21:02.900
Oh, that death threat overhead.

21:03.690 --> 21:05.650
No, I meant speaking in public.

21:06.690 --> 21:09.990
What's that old saw? Picture your
audience in their underwear?

21:10.890 --> 21:12.119
Way ahead of you.

21:15.690 --> 21:17.369
Happy retirement, Daddy.

21:17.490 --> 21:18.930
- See you later.
- Who's this?

21:19.890 --> 21:21.640
My friend Angel.
Angel, this is my father.

21:21.690 --> 21:23.130
Hello. Congratulations.

21:23.490 --> 21:26.190
For what? All I did was live
this long and not get shot.

21:27.089 --> 21:28.980
- Why do you do that?
- Do what?

21:30.089 --> 21:31.880
Pretend important things don't matter.

21:33.089 --> 21:36.279
So, Angel, how long you
been seeing Katie?

21:37.289 --> 21:38.900
We're pretty new friends.

21:39.089 --> 21:40.670
Good to see her out with a man.

21:41.490 --> 21:44.440
I was starting to wonder
if she leaned in another direction.

21:46.289 --> 21:50.079
All right, everyone, before we cut
the cake, the other Officer Lockley...

21:51.089 --> 21:53.930
...the good-looking one, wants
to say a few words. Kate?

22:04.890 --> 22:06.259
Hi, everybody.

22:07.890 --> 22:09.750
Welcome to the end of an era.

22:12.089 --> 22:14.410
The old man wants us to
believe he could care less...

22:14.490 --> 22:17.579
...about all this attention
and free booze.

22:19.289 --> 22:21.180
But I know him better than that.

22:22.289 --> 22:26.150
He put a lot of years in on the job
and made a difference in many lives.

22:29.490 --> 22:33.279
And now it's over. It's a huge deal,
no matter what he says.

22:35.490 --> 22:38.119
In fact, I don't know what
he's gonna do with himself.

22:38.490 --> 22:41.470
He forgot how to be anything
but a cop a long time ago.

22:42.089 --> 22:45.950
And maybe that's why
I became a cop too.

22:51.690 --> 22:54.390
After Mom died, you stopped, you know.

22:56.490 --> 22:58.839
It was like you couldn't
stand the sight of me.

23:00.089 --> 23:02.480
Her face, her eyes looking up at you.

23:05.490 --> 23:07.420
But big girls don't cry, right?

23:09.089 --> 23:12.809
You said, "Gone's gone and
there's no use wallowing."

23:13.289 --> 23:16.170
Worms and dirt and nothing, forever.

23:18.089 --> 23:20.299
Not one word about a better place.

23:26.490 --> 23:29.750
You couldn't even tell a
scared little girl a beautiful lie.

23:33.089 --> 23:36.710
God, I wanted to drink with you.
I wanted you to laugh once with me...

23:37.890 --> 23:40.519
...the way you laughed with
Jimmy here or Frank.

23:42.089 --> 23:44.410
What the hell did they do to her
in that class?

23:46.890 --> 23:48.430
My best friend, Joanne?

23:50.490 --> 23:54.460
Her mom was soft and she smelled
like macaroni and cheese.

23:55.289 --> 23:59.859
And she would pick me up
on her lap and she'd rock me.

24:02.490 --> 24:05.259
She said she wanted to
keep me for herself...

24:06.690 --> 24:08.650
...that I was good and sweet.

24:10.890 --> 24:12.920
Everybody said I was.

24:15.089 --> 24:18.599
Do you realize that you have
never told me that I'm pretty?

24:19.289 --> 24:20.940
Not once in my life.

24:22.289 --> 24:23.660
Keep going, Katie.

24:24.089 --> 24:26.119
Well, I can't anymore, Dad.

24:27.089 --> 24:30.140
I can't campaign for the office
of your beloved daughter.

24:31.890 --> 24:35.259
You closed your heart after
Mom left us and that's it!

24:40.289 --> 24:43.029
- That was so damn brave.
- Are you kidding me?

24:43.289 --> 24:44.869
This wasn't the forum.

24:45.690 --> 24:47.410
She can't worry about protecting him.

24:48.089 --> 24:50.859
Let it out. I always knew
your mother was controlling.

24:51.690 --> 24:53.619
- I'm passive-aggressive?
- I hear denial.

24:54.089 --> 24:55.809
She abused the process.

24:55.890 --> 24:57.920
You're completely blocked!

24:58.890 --> 25:00.750
Your need for catharsis
isn't the issue!

25:01.289 --> 25:02.450
I'll give you catharsis.

25:10.890 --> 25:14.509
For God's sake, Jimmy.
Keep it together, will you?

25:15.089 --> 25:17.549
I'll take him to his precinct
to sleep it off with the drunks.

25:18.089 --> 25:19.769
You should do likewise.

25:20.490 --> 25:22.559
Come on, let's go.

25:26.049 --> 25:29.240
All right, I'm here.
What's the big emergency?

25:30.250 --> 25:33.440
Because these late hours are eating
into my potential social life.

25:34.450 --> 25:38.309
Why I ever thought it was a nifty idea
to work for a ventriloquist--

25:38.650 --> 25:40.230
- Hi.
- Hi.

25:41.049 --> 25:42.059
Drink this.

25:45.849 --> 25:49.539
You have the most intense eyes.
I see such an old soul.

25:50.049 --> 25:51.029
He gets that a lot.

25:51.250 --> 25:53.740
I thought that enigmatic thing
was an act to get women.

25:54.849 --> 25:57.970
The truth is, you don't have
an insincere bone in your body.

25:58.450 --> 26:01.220
Tell me about the sensitivity
training. Who's running it?

26:02.049 --> 26:04.609
You want to go?
It's pretty wonderful.

26:05.049 --> 26:05.920
Gets you where you live.

26:06.250 --> 26:07.160
I need to know his name.

26:08.049 --> 26:10.539
We all need so much.

26:11.049 --> 26:13.440
What's her deal? Too much...?

26:14.650 --> 26:16.470
- Thumb-sucking?
- Alcohol, dummy.

26:17.049 --> 26:17.849
Don't look at me.

26:18.250 --> 26:21.089
I'm not the one that needs to
brush up on her finger pantomime.

26:22.450 --> 26:24.519
Something to do with
training she had at work.

26:33.250 --> 26:35.809
Someone's got a crush.

26:36.250 --> 26:38.349
- What?
- It's right there.

26:39.250 --> 26:41.920
How he feels about you.
You don't know what to do about it.

26:42.250 --> 26:44.140
Please. We just joke around.

26:44.650 --> 26:46.440
Where is the truth?
Where is the truth?

26:47.049 --> 26:49.509
He's hiding behind Mr. Humor.

26:51.250 --> 26:54.940
I mean, look at Doyle. Really look
at him. What do you see?

26:56.049 --> 26:57.380
A bad double poly blend?

26:57.849 --> 26:59.079
That's defense, Cordelia.

26:59.650 --> 27:03.230
Maybe you should try to open
your heart to a new possibility.

27:04.450 --> 27:06.339
- She's starting to make sense--
- Angel!

27:06.849 --> 27:08.569
I got his address, 322 Fletcher.

27:09.849 --> 27:11.460
What aren't you telling me, Angel?

27:11.650 --> 27:14.180
I'm glad we came to watch
late Night With Creepy Cop,

27:14.650 --> 27:17.809
Stay with her while I find this guy.
Don't let her out of your sight.

28:13.210 --> 28:14.579
What's going on here?

28:17.410 --> 28:18.920
That's a good question, Allen.

28:25.809 --> 28:28.900
Can we get you some coffee?
Or Valium? Or both?

28:29.410 --> 28:31.829
He walked out on me.
He just walked out.

28:32.410 --> 28:34.200
He'll be back.

28:34.809 --> 28:36.349
Not Angel. My father.

28:37.210 --> 28:38.049
Oh.

28:39.009 --> 28:41.640
- I have to find him.
- Maybe you should hold off for now.

28:42.009 --> 28:44.259
- Angel said we should wait.
- I hear you.

28:45.009 --> 28:46.240
But I need to find my dad.

28:46.809 --> 28:48.420
Detective, you're not yourself.

28:48.609 --> 28:50.680
- Why don't we all just--?
- Help each other?

28:51.009 --> 28:52.019
By staying here.

28:52.809 --> 28:54.210
We could, but I have this...

28:54.609 --> 28:55.869
Personal problem?

28:56.410 --> 28:58.369
...gun. I don't want
to seem insensitive, but...

28:58.809 --> 29:01.160
...if either of you try to stop me,
I'll blow you away...

29:01.809 --> 29:03.529
...because I'm gonna find my dad.

29:06.009 --> 29:09.630
Which demon do you worship?
Which one gives you your power?

29:10.210 --> 29:12.309
A whole bunch, actually.
I'm a polytheist.

29:13.210 --> 29:14.720
I'm not here to play games.

29:15.009 --> 29:17.109
You have rage. I get that.

29:17.410 --> 29:20.039
- What did you do to Kate?
- Do you know what anger is?

29:21.009 --> 29:22.549
- It's fear.
- I know what fear is.

29:22.809 --> 29:24.740
- I can smell it right now.
- That's good.

29:25.210 --> 29:27.740
Give yourself permission to open up.

29:28.809 --> 29:30.140
What were your parents like?

29:31.210 --> 29:32.289
My parents were great.

29:33.609 --> 29:35.289
Tasted a lot like chicken.

29:36.609 --> 29:38.400
Why don't you talk?

29:39.609 --> 29:41.569
Sorry I was insensitive, George.

29:42.009 --> 29:44.750
- Listen, I'm having an epiphany.
- It's not right.

29:45.609 --> 29:49.259
Trapped together that way.
The big ones picking on the weak ones.

30:08.410 --> 30:11.960
It's not right. Makes them more
brutal than when they came in.

30:44.410 --> 30:48.380
Remember this, brothers.
An act of kindness is just as manly--

30:52.809 --> 30:55.059
Dad? Daddy?

31:04.210 --> 31:06.740
Whiplash?
I'll tell you about whiplash.

31:07.210 --> 31:10.789
I've got emotional whiplash from
dealing with people like you each day.

31:11.410 --> 31:14.849
If anyone's the victim, it's me!
I've alienated my friends, my family.

31:15.609 --> 31:19.049
My own children are afraid of me.
I can't even make love to my wife.

31:19.809 --> 31:24.380
I hear you. I don't think you're
listening to your mugger's feelings.

31:28.210 --> 31:29.369
Wait, wait, wait!

31:30.009 --> 31:31.410
- What are you--?
- We followed Kate.

31:31.809 --> 31:34.230
She's lost it. She looked
ready to do some damage.

31:34.809 --> 31:37.440
- And it's not just her.
- The whole place is going nuts.

31:37.809 --> 31:39.319
This is so not good.

31:41.410 --> 31:43.660
Okay, I think someone needs a hug.

31:54.890 --> 31:56.329
Hey, what's your damage?

31:56.690 --> 31:58.720
I think he just found
Mr. Sensitivity.

31:59.690 --> 32:01.859
He was in here all the time,
waiting to come out.

32:02.690 --> 32:04.970
Gosh, what our folks do to us.

32:05.089 --> 32:07.650
Please, Daddy, if you're there,
pick up. We need to talk.

32:09.289 --> 32:10.299
Daddy!

32:11.690 --> 32:14.109
He put the whammy on you!
You stink with whammy.

32:14.690 --> 32:15.920
She's right.

32:17.089 --> 32:18.460
Talking Stick, it's cursed.

32:18.890 --> 32:20.750
There's a stick that talks?

32:21.289 --> 32:24.309
Cordelia, do you have any idea
just how precious you are?

32:24.890 --> 32:27.099
All right, let's just
talk about the stick.

32:27.890 --> 32:31.220
He uses it as a talisman. Anyone
who handles it becomes infected.

32:32.089 --> 32:36.369
He admitted it to me after I
threatened him with physical violence.

32:38.089 --> 32:38.960
What's his trip?

32:39.890 --> 32:42.700
Wolfram and Hart hired
this guy to neutralize the police...

32:42.890 --> 32:44.329
...so Little Tony could escape.

32:44.690 --> 32:46.019
- It'll wear off.
- Soon?

32:46.490 --> 32:48.240
So no contract on Detective Lockley.

32:48.890 --> 32:52.119
Little Tony's plan all along was to
kill her himself. Poor guy.

32:53.089 --> 32:54.880
- Poor guy?
- Well, he's got issues.

32:55.490 --> 32:56.890
Angel, snap out of this!

32:57.289 --> 33:01.150
Right now! It's time for you to get
all vampy. Kate needs you!

33:03.890 --> 33:07.329
I don't want to. You both withdraw
when I go vamp. I feel you judge me.

33:08.089 --> 33:11.460
We won't judge you.
Will we? Give it a try.

33:12.289 --> 33:14.039
Closeness is too important to me now.

33:14.690 --> 33:17.950
- Angel, man, Kate is in there!
- Along with killer guy!

33:23.690 --> 33:25.269
- We're closed.
- You're the police!

33:25.490 --> 33:27.099
- You can't close!
- Why not?

33:27.890 --> 33:29.009
Haven't we done enough?

33:29.089 --> 33:33.660
It's always "find this, rescue that"
with you people. See how you like it.

33:36.890 --> 33:40.150
I wanted to express my regret for
having treated you so shabbily.

33:41.089 --> 33:45.130
So I composed a poem about it:
"I saw a leaf, and I did cry...."

33:48.289 --> 33:49.660
It hurts, doesn't it?

33:50.089 --> 33:52.369
When people don't listen?
When they reject you?

33:53.089 --> 33:55.049
- You know?
- I ought to.

33:55.490 --> 33:58.859
For two years, I've been saying
to you, "Love me, Kate.

34:00.289 --> 34:01.829
Need me the way I need you."

34:02.089 --> 34:05.880
But you never notice.
Never return my desire.

34:06.890 --> 34:10.929
You just sit at that desk next to
mine, smelling the way you do...

34:11.690 --> 34:12.880
...taunting me.

34:14.690 --> 34:18.730
You guys, you're working for Little
Tony now. You'll find I'm stern...

34:20.690 --> 34:24.018
...but fair. Now come on,
let's go kill us a lady cop.

34:26.570 --> 34:29.309
- We need a rock.
- I'm not comfortable with this.

34:30.170 --> 34:32.059
Don't argue.
This is the only way in.

34:33.170 --> 34:34.849
Here, this one should do it.

34:36.768 --> 34:37.969
- Aim for the window!
- I was!

34:37.969 --> 34:39.130
Give me that.

34:42.170 --> 34:43.289
Nice arm.

34:43.369 --> 34:45.159
Angel, now it's your turn. Come on!

34:57.170 --> 34:58.920
Come on! Let's go.

34:59.570 --> 35:01.989
Wow. That's vandalism.

35:02.570 --> 35:04.039
We'll take care of it later.

35:04.969 --> 35:07.570
- We should leave a note.
- Would you come on!

35:07.969 --> 35:09.369
- What's the magic word?
- Urgh!

35:09.769 --> 35:11.099
I don't think "urgh" is it...

35:11.570 --> 35:15.050
...if one would call it a word and
even so, certainly not a magic one.

35:15.769 --> 35:18.440
- We don't have time!
- There's always time to be considerate.

35:19.369 --> 35:23.090
- Oh, please.
- See? That wasn't so hard, was it?

35:27.170 --> 35:29.269
Thought you finally had it over on me?

35:30.769 --> 35:32.800
Thought you were smarter
than Little Tony?

35:33.769 --> 35:36.719
Nobody beats me, baby,
not even a stone bitch like you.

35:37.369 --> 35:40.039
I am not a bitch!
I'm just protected.

35:40.369 --> 35:42.650
- No one protecting you now.
- Hey!

35:46.369 --> 35:48.579
I feel serious negative
energy in this room.

35:49.369 --> 35:51.190
Go on, take care of him.

35:51.769 --> 35:53.519
I've been wanting to see you again.

35:53.570 --> 35:56.590
I'm sure he'd say the same,
but that gun makes you seem hostile.

35:57.170 --> 35:59.130
That and the body language.
It's so closed.

36:00.170 --> 36:02.630
- Yeah.
- Angel, man, fight. Don't talk!

36:03.170 --> 36:04.079
We are so dead.

36:04.369 --> 36:08.340
Now, why don't we all just sit down
together and process this?

36:09.769 --> 36:13.530
Seems that sensitivity training I
paid for really took, Nancy-boy.

36:18.170 --> 36:19.920
How do you think that makes me feel?

36:24.170 --> 36:26.559
Okay, now I'm feeling unheard.

36:31.969 --> 36:35.690
You know, Anthony, you can be
a rainbow and not a...

36:37.969 --> 36:39.480
..."pain-bow."

36:40.969 --> 36:42.860
I mean, it really is all up to you.

36:45.170 --> 36:46.250
You.

36:48.170 --> 36:49.469
No, you.

36:50.570 --> 36:51.940
Come here.

36:56.570 --> 36:58.179
Anyone for vomit?

37:04.369 --> 37:05.559
It's so sad, isn't it?

37:05.570 --> 37:08.170
Some people just really need
to live in the problem.

37:13.969 --> 37:14.980
What do I pay you for?

37:15.170 --> 37:17.730
Where the hell are you?
I want my limo here now!

37:18.769 --> 37:20.769
That's not possible, Mr. Papazian.

37:21.170 --> 37:22.610
What? What are you telling me?

37:22.969 --> 37:26.480
You attempted to murder a police
officer in full view of witnesses.

37:27.769 --> 37:30.719
- We can't risk exposure,
- You're the one set this thing up!

37:31.369 --> 37:32.380
We opened a door for you,

37:32.570 --> 37:35.099
You were to walk through it,
not blast your way out.

37:36.170 --> 37:39.010
The senior partners feel you're a
liability, We can't waste...

37:39.170 --> 37:41.099
...energy when there are
pressing issues.

37:41.570 --> 37:44.900
- What pressing issues?
- Our relationship is terminated.

37:45.769 --> 37:47.070
As is this phone call.

37:55.250 --> 37:56.619
- Morning.
- Yeah, right.

37:57.050 --> 37:59.119
- How do you feel?
- Pretty foolish. You?

38:00.050 --> 38:01.280
I'm all right.

38:01.849 --> 38:05.079
Internal Affairs is investigating the
Blue Bar. Someone spiked the punch.

38:06.050 --> 38:09.210
Seems like everyone went a little
crazy. I know I did with my dad.

38:10.250 --> 38:11.760
Well, maybe it helped.

38:12.650 --> 38:15.530
Did I...?
Did I say anything to you?

38:16.849 --> 38:18.809
I'm a little fuzzy myself.

38:19.250 --> 38:20.260
Good.

38:21.650 --> 38:24.599
- Well, I should get back to work.
- Yeah, me too.

38:37.250 --> 38:38.969
- Hi.
- Katie.

38:39.650 --> 38:43.690
- Got your messages on my machine.
- That was kind of a bizarre night--

38:44.449 --> 38:45.460
Katie...

38:47.449 --> 38:48.849
...don't say anything.

38:51.650 --> 38:54.699
You make an idiot of yourself,
embarrass me in front of the guys.

38:55.250 --> 38:58.760
You don't bring that up ever again.
Far as I'm concerned...

39:00.050 --> 39:01.130
...it didn't happen.

39:02.305 --> 39:08.942
