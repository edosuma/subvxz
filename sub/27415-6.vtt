03:08.800 --> 03:11.200
Love, you should try to eat.

03:15.440 --> 03:19.440
I'll put it up here
for when you get hungry.

03:33.160 --> 03:35.820
I have to go out for a bit.

03:35.920 --> 03:38.080
I'll be as quick as I can.

03:50.120 --> 03:54.580
Lorrie, love. For the distress
I've caused you...

03:54.680 --> 03:56.540
I'm not distressed,
I'm exhausted.

03:56.640 --> 03:58.580
And you don't have to apologise.

03:58.680 --> 04:00.460
You were obviously corrupted
by...

04:00.560 --> 04:02.060
No, I wasn't, Lorrie.

04:02.160 --> 04:04.720
No, no, Herb, that wasn't you.

04:15.880 --> 04:20.020
Isaac? I just need to ask you
a few questions.

04:20.120 --> 04:22.120
Is that OK?

04:23.560 --> 04:28.340
The person who showed you this,
it was Tommy Brydon,

04:28.440 --> 04:31.600
the man who was tied up
outside your fort?

04:32.920 --> 04:35.340
I need to find him.

04:35.440 --> 04:38.240
Do you have any idea
where he might be?

05:21.480 --> 05:23.180
No! No, no, no!

05:23.280 --> 05:24.820
-Please listen.
-Get out! Get out!

05:24.920 --> 05:27.220
-I'm not gonna hurt you!
-Get back or I'll kill you.

05:27.320 --> 05:29.460
-I would never hurt you, OK?
-Get the fuck back!

05:29.560 --> 05:31.020
Whatever you want.

05:31.120 --> 05:34.740
You are a monster,
what you did to my husband.

05:34.840 --> 05:36.980
I'm trying to tell ya,
I didn't touch him.

05:37.080 --> 05:39.980
-You're a liar!
-I'm not lying!

05:40.080 --> 05:44.500
OK, there are some things that
I didn't tell the truth about,

05:44.600 --> 05:46.380
like being a marginally
older man.

05:46.480 --> 05:51.540
-I'm calling the police.
-No, don't... OK, alright.

05:51.640 --> 05:56.100
OK. You can call the cops,
if that's what you want to do,

05:56.200 --> 05:58.640
but not before you tell me
that you believe me.

06:00.400 --> 06:04.560
'Cause I did not...
I did not kill him.

06:07.000 --> 06:10.340
I did take him to the station
to return him to you

06:10.440 --> 06:11.500
so my DNA's all over him

06:11.600 --> 06:15.140
so when they catch me,
that's it.

06:15.240 --> 06:16.660
I'm done.

06:16.760 --> 06:19.100
For good.

06:19.200 --> 06:21.200
So, please...

06:24.320 --> 06:26.920
..tell me you believe me.

06:34.400 --> 06:36.060
Why does it matter?

06:36.160 --> 06:38.160
Because...

06:42.440 --> 06:44.440
..I care about ya.

06:46.840 --> 06:50.880
I care...about you.

07:11.040 --> 07:15.040
-How did you do this?
-It's in the caravan.

07:17.720 --> 07:19.720
The plant.

07:22.320 --> 07:24.860
It's yours now.

07:24.960 --> 07:26.960
You do with it what you will.

07:35.000 --> 07:37.400
-Just wait here.
-Yeah.

08:07.560 --> 08:08.740
Hey.

08:08.840 --> 08:13.220
Um...now's really not
a good time.

08:13.320 --> 08:16.220
No doubt.

08:16.320 --> 08:18.360
How are you holding up?

08:22.520 --> 08:24.700
Um...

08:24.800 --> 08:28.420
..barely. I keep thinking
I'm going to wake up

08:28.520 --> 08:32.280
and Griffo's going to tell me
it's all a stupid joke.

08:33.520 --> 08:35.020
Guess he wouldn't be laughing

08:35.120 --> 08:38.200
if he knew Tommy Brydon
had given you this.

08:42.240 --> 08:43.900
Well, not old Tommy, of course,

08:44.000 --> 08:48.140
but a younger,
more manipulative version,

08:48.240 --> 08:50.300
if your husband was correct.

08:50.400 --> 08:55.640
He stole it from a dead woman's
body to give to you.

08:59.800 --> 09:02.540
No matter how much of
a smooth talker he is, Tina,

09:02.640 --> 09:04.420
he killed Griffo.

09:04.520 --> 09:06.520
No, he said he'd...

09:11.440 --> 09:14.520
Do you know where Tommy is?

10:40.360 --> 10:45.260
OK. I, um...
I'm a coward, Ray,

10:45.360 --> 10:47.860
because I should be saying this
to you in person

10:47.960 --> 10:49.740
but every time I try to

10:49.840 --> 10:55.980
all I can see is your eyes
willing me, imploring me,

10:56.080 --> 10:59.540
not to give up, to fight.

10:59.640 --> 11:04.980
But soon I won't be able to
feed myself, to talk.

11:05.080 --> 11:11.360
When I get to the point where
I no longer know who I am...

11:13.120 --> 11:15.720
..I don't want you to be there.

11:17.280 --> 11:20.420
You have put me first
for more than 50 years

11:20.520 --> 11:25.020
and now I want you
to put yourself first.

11:25.120 --> 11:31.780
I need you to put me in care
and get the hell out,

11:31.880 --> 11:33.920
cut and run.

11:35.440 --> 11:39.200
Because I know you,
I know you so well.

11:40.280 --> 11:42.820
I know that you won't
give up

11:42.920 --> 11:44.180
and I want you to give up,

11:44.280 --> 11:46.880
I want you to find
your own life, Ray.

11:48.520 --> 11:50.520
I love you.

12:15.600 --> 12:17.640
You are trespassing.

12:23.240 --> 12:25.240
Farida.

12:28.240 --> 12:32.900
Farida, I'm Ray, Gwen's husband.
Remember Gwen?

12:33.000 --> 12:36.820
She was in the room next to you
at the care home.

12:36.920 --> 12:38.700
Yes, I do.

12:38.800 --> 12:41.480
You walked past my room
every day.

12:42.600 --> 12:44.600
Not as much as a hello.

12:47.640 --> 12:49.300
I didn't realise.

12:49.400 --> 12:51.640
I was alone in that place.

12:52.840 --> 12:54.840
No-one came to visit.

12:55.640 --> 13:01.260
Farida, I need your help
with Gwen.

13:01.360 --> 13:03.360
You know she needs this.

13:04.320 --> 13:07.000
Remember how sick she was?

13:08.480 --> 13:11.860
So what is it that you are
prepared to do?

13:11.960 --> 13:15.360
Look, I know how difficult
this must be for you...

13:16.520 --> 13:19.940
..Ranjeet dying here.

13:20.040 --> 13:23.160
No. It's not.

13:24.240 --> 13:26.360
Because I'm free.

13:29.080 --> 13:31.280
And if you come here again...

13:32.720 --> 13:35.000
..I will not be so gracious.

13:58.800 --> 14:02.600
She had suitcases.

14:04.080 --> 14:05.900
She was leaving me.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.320
No, no, honey, no, she...

14:13.560 --> 14:15.840
She was leaving me.

14:19.320 --> 14:21.640
I'm sorry I lied to you, Zacky.

14:23.640 --> 14:26.880
But you remember how much
we were fighting, don't you?

14:29.840 --> 14:31.900
She found a new job
in the city.

14:32.000 --> 14:35.260
A place of her own.

14:35.360 --> 14:38.500
She wanted me to tell you
after she left but...

14:38.600 --> 14:40.720
..when we lost her...

14:44.280 --> 14:47.220
But she was gonna call you
as soon as she got settled

14:47.320 --> 14:49.760
and see you as much
as she could.

14:51.680 --> 14:53.820
Then why didn't she take me?

14:53.920 --> 14:56.320
Because we both wanted you.

14:57.880 --> 15:00.020
And I couldn't live without you.

15:00.120 --> 15:02.520
So this is not about you.

15:04.400 --> 15:06.840
We just stopped
making each other happy.

15:09.640 --> 15:12.240
What if I stop making you happy?

15:15.240 --> 15:18.460
You can make me as miserable
as you like

15:18.560 --> 15:20.660
and I'm not goin' nowhere.

15:20.760 --> 15:22.960
I promise you.

15:58.280 --> 16:00.760
Are you my mummy?

16:25.800 --> 16:28.380
I don't... I don't
belong in this place.

16:28.480 --> 16:29.820
What is this place?

16:29.920 --> 16:33.060
No, no, stop it, stop it!

16:33.160 --> 16:36.060
No! No, no, NO!

16:36.160 --> 16:38.880
Stop it! Stop it!

17:58.640 --> 18:00.940
Oi!

18:01.040 --> 18:02.580
Hey, kid!

18:02.680 --> 18:04.740
I've been looking for you
everywhere.

18:04.840 --> 18:05.980
Get away from me.

18:06.080 --> 18:09.780
Yeah, that's alright.
That's alright. I get it.

18:09.880 --> 18:11.880
I'd hate me guts too.

18:13.160 --> 18:16.260
I knew I should have
told you way earlier

18:16.360 --> 18:17.980
but I just wanted to...

18:18.080 --> 18:20.480
I just wanted to
see you again, you know?

18:23.920 --> 18:27.300
For probably the last time.

18:27.400 --> 18:31.460
Hey, listen to me. You deserve
some fun now, alright?

18:31.560 --> 18:33.740
To be a regular kid.

18:33.840 --> 18:36.960
And do...regular kid shit.

18:38.560 --> 18:41.340
Not that you're a regular kid
at all, you know.

18:43.600 --> 18:45.600
Oh, sh...

18:47.000 --> 18:51.260
So, ah, take care of yourself.

18:51.360 --> 18:54.040
I'll see you around, alright?
You be a good man.

18:55.320 --> 18:58.020
That's OK.

18:58.120 --> 19:00.120
Bye.

20:21.520 --> 20:23.520
What are you doing with that?

20:29.760 --> 20:31.060
I need it, Max.

20:31.160 --> 20:33.160
What for?

20:34.600 --> 20:36.920
To help Gwen.

20:41.640 --> 20:44.360
It doesn't leave here
without me.

21:43.560 --> 21:45.560
Sam!

21:51.680 --> 21:53.680
Tommy.

22:09.200 --> 22:11.720
Sam!

23:25.360 --> 23:30.500
Well, I see you're still you.

23:30.600 --> 23:33.880
Or not you, more to the point.

23:41.680 --> 23:44.120
I lost the baby.

23:54.800 --> 24:01.440
If there was one thing that
I wanted more in this world...

24:02.680 --> 24:04.860
..a baby.

24:04.960 --> 24:09.300
The one thing I should have
given up everything for

24:09.400 --> 24:10.700
and I didn't.

24:10.800 --> 24:13.820
I'm sorry.

24:13.920 --> 24:19.700
Oh. We all like to think
our time's unlimited

24:19.800 --> 24:22.520
but it's not.

24:24.520 --> 24:28.100
You know, I can remember

24:28.200 --> 24:32.700
seeing you
in a Christmas concert once.

24:32.800 --> 24:34.540
We were both teenagers.

24:34.640 --> 24:40.840
And I thought, "If only
I could be so brave.

24:42.200 --> 24:45.080
"If only I had your gift."

24:46.400 --> 24:48.400
And look where it took you.

24:49.680 --> 24:53.920
Children are wonderful
but they leave you.

24:56.240 --> 24:58.240
Then what do you have?

25:02.400 --> 25:08.040
And your Ray, there's nothing
he wouldn't do for you.

25:27.920 --> 25:29.920
Thank you.

25:41.760 --> 25:44.320
Tommy Brydon's
been arrested.

25:46.480 --> 25:48.480
Good.

25:49.840 --> 25:51.740
That's good.

25:51.840 --> 25:53.660
It is.

25:53.760 --> 25:56.660
Interesting character, isn't he?

25:56.760 --> 25:59.000
Both versions of him.

26:00.600 --> 26:04.980
'Cause that's not news to you,
is it?

26:05.080 --> 26:07.540
That the young fella
you were seeing

26:07.640 --> 26:09.680
is also old Tommy?

26:11.920 --> 26:16.680
Which leaves us with something
very alarming going on here.

26:17.640 --> 26:19.640
Yeah.

26:20.440 --> 26:22.440
If it's true.

26:24.320 --> 26:26.700
Tina, for Griffo's sake,

26:26.800 --> 26:30.860
to prove that he was right
and that he wasn't insane,

26:30.960 --> 26:33.240
you need to tell me.

26:35.080 --> 26:39.580
"No more left."
That's what Tommy said to me.

26:39.680 --> 26:41.680
No more what?

26:43.520 --> 26:46.260
I don't know.

26:46.360 --> 26:48.360
Magic beans?

26:49.680 --> 26:51.680
Sorry, it's...

26:52.640 --> 26:54.720
It's just too crazy.

26:56.040 --> 26:58.040
Yeah.

27:03.760 --> 27:05.760
Find the toilet.

27:19.000 --> 27:21.500
Hey.

27:21.600 --> 27:22.820
It'll grow.

27:22.920 --> 27:25.980
-Take the whole thing.
-That'll kill it.

27:26.080 --> 27:28.320
Not if we protect the roots.
Take the whole thing.

28:27.640 --> 28:30.220
-Oh, Christ.
-No, no...

28:30.320 --> 28:34.460
Look at you both.
Two strong men.

28:34.560 --> 28:35.820
It doesn't have to be like this.

28:35.920 --> 28:38.000
Max!

28:44.040 --> 28:45.380
No!

29:22.040 --> 29:24.040
I'm sorry.

29:24.920 --> 29:27.520
-I'm sorry.
-Christ, Max.

29:30.640 --> 29:33.260
I'm sorry.

29:33.360 --> 29:35.400
I'll get help.

29:56.680 --> 29:59.100
I wasn't lying to you.

29:59.200 --> 30:02.160
I wouldn't even let myself
think it.

30:03.640 --> 30:04.820
Whenever it entered my head

30:04.920 --> 30:08.680
I'd...I'd condemn
the very thought.

30:10.240 --> 30:16.200
I'd hear my father's words,
his...his disgust.

30:21.360 --> 30:23.340
Did you ever love me?

30:23.440 --> 30:25.140
Of course I love you.

30:25.240 --> 30:29.180
You've been my life
for the last 52 years.

30:29.280 --> 30:31.280
My best friend.

30:32.240 --> 30:35.180
I'm only sorry that...

30:35.280 --> 30:39.060
..that you didn't have someone
who could've offered you more

30:39.160 --> 30:42.140
if I wasn't enough.

30:42.240 --> 30:47.240
And I'll understand it
if you want to leave me.

30:48.480 --> 30:51.780
Well, that's ridiculous.

30:51.880 --> 30:53.880
And go where?

30:57.920 --> 31:00.440
I suppose I did consider it.

31:02.680 --> 31:05.780
You weren't like other men.

31:05.880 --> 31:08.280
I think that's probably
why I loved you.

31:09.960 --> 31:12.240
You listened to me.

31:13.800 --> 31:16.240
You understood me.

31:17.360 --> 31:19.360
And I felt as if...

31:20.400 --> 31:22.440
..I was home.

31:30.120 --> 31:33.760
And I think a roast
would be nice.

32:11.000 --> 32:13.520
What really happened here, Ray?

32:14.560 --> 32:16.580
What the hell's going on?

32:16.680 --> 32:20.180
Farida Korrapati did this?

32:20.280 --> 32:22.320
A 92-year-old woman?

32:24.440 --> 32:26.660
It's where her husband died.

32:26.760 --> 32:28.760
Did you know that?

32:29.480 --> 32:32.580
It was horrific.
Trapped in the toilet.

32:32.680 --> 32:34.780
All bloated.

32:34.880 --> 32:37.900
I found Farida clinging
to the roof.

32:38.000 --> 32:40.220
Silent.

32:40.320 --> 32:42.480
Couldn't get a word
out of her.

32:44.160 --> 32:47.300
Look, it just won't stop.

32:47.400 --> 32:50.580
The pain from that day.

32:50.680 --> 32:55.700
You found... You found them all,
the bodies?

32:55.800 --> 32:58.200
My worst nightmare.

32:59.200 --> 33:01.400
In your home town.

33:04.040 --> 33:09.820
And Tina's sister.
You found her on the riverbank?

33:09.920 --> 33:11.500
I mean, that's what they said.

33:11.600 --> 33:15.200
No, Griffo's caravan.
Why?

33:23.480 --> 33:25.180
We'll talk after, Rhonda.

33:25.280 --> 33:27.400
No, no, Ray, we haven't
finished, mate.

33:28.480 --> 33:30.740
Ray!

33:30.840 --> 33:34.120
-Gwen. Come with me.
-That's Max! What happened?

33:36.560 --> 33:39.460
Karen did not die
by the river.

33:39.560 --> 33:41.580
What are you talking about

33:41.680 --> 33:43.680
We've still got one chance.

33:47.120 --> 33:49.900
No, I don't...
I don't want to...

33:50.000 --> 33:52.540
I don't want to do this, Ray,
please.

33:52.640 --> 33:54.980
I'm sorry that I hurt you
and I love you

33:55.080 --> 33:57.020
but I don't want to do this
anymore.

33:57.120 --> 33:59.580
I just... I just want to
go home.

33:59.680 --> 34:01.760
Yeah.

34:30.040 --> 34:31.660
Ray, please.

34:31.760 --> 34:33.380
It's OK.

34:33.480 --> 34:36.260
It was here.

34:36.360 --> 34:37.700
-Ray.
-It's gone.

34:37.800 --> 34:40.420
I don't want to do this anymore.
Please.

34:40.520 --> 34:42.100
Why?

34:42.200 --> 34:44.700
I just want to go home.

34:44.800 --> 34:48.780
I just want to spend time
together. While we still can.

34:48.880 --> 34:50.880
But I only just got you back.

35:13.920 --> 35:15.920
Down there!

35:22.520 --> 35:24.520
There it is.

35:40.000 --> 35:42.460
Tina, I think you've got
something in there

35:42.560 --> 35:44.700
that we really need.

35:44.800 --> 35:46.420
I can't help you, I'm sorry.

35:46.520 --> 35:48.520
It's for Gwen.

36:11.640 --> 36:15.100
This is my chance
to get the hell out of Mullan.

36:15.200 --> 36:16.420
Have a new life.

36:16.520 --> 36:18.740
I don't want to take that
away from you.

36:18.840 --> 36:22.540
But when she ages back
she'll be gone.

36:22.640 --> 36:25.720
Yeah, when it runs out,
well, what then?

36:27.320 --> 36:29.660
Oh, Tina.

36:29.760 --> 36:33.600
I'm begging you.
I just need more time.

36:40.360 --> 36:43.780
-OK.
-Thank you.

36:43.880 --> 36:46.140
Ray.

36:46.240 --> 36:48.280
Ray.

37:10.880 --> 37:12.880
Get down!

37:18.040 --> 37:20.100
Farida.

37:20.200 --> 37:22.780
Come on. Put it down.

37:22.880 --> 37:24.880
Put the gun down.

37:31.520 --> 37:32.900
Don't do this.

37:33.000 --> 37:36.420
Give it to me.
What you stole.

37:36.520 --> 37:39.540
I can't.
It's not for you alone.

37:39.640 --> 37:43.260
-Give me the plant!
-Farida.

37:43.360 --> 37:45.360
-No! No!

37:50.640 --> 37:52.640
Ray.

37:56.000 --> 37:58.240
Stop!

39:48.320 --> 39:50.320
I am sorry.

39:52.200 --> 39:54.200
Don't be.

39:55.400 --> 39:57.680
It is what it is, Ray.

40:13.120 --> 40:15.020
I can't go back to that, Ray.

40:15.120 --> 40:18.060
Oh, no, love. No.

40:18.160 --> 40:21.980
It's the only way. It is.

40:22.080 --> 40:23.780
But I'll look after you.

40:23.880 --> 40:25.700
I know you will.

40:25.800 --> 40:30.080
And that's why I have to do
this, for both of us.

40:32.040 --> 40:36.440
And at least now we can say
a proper goodbye to each other.

40:41.400 --> 40:44.920
My beautiful, beautiful husband.

41:15.920 --> 41:18.080
Does it hurt?

41:19.720 --> 41:22.180
No.

41:25.320 --> 41:27.800
Remember our deal, OK?

41:29.040 --> 41:31.400
To cut and run.

41:35.120 --> 41:37.440
And never look back.

41:43.680 --> 41:45.880
And thank you.

41:48.440 --> 41:50.480
Thank you.

42:33.560 --> 42:35.960
Thank you.

43:50.320 --> 43:52.600
My Star Man.

43:54.280 --> 43:56.420
Yep.

43:56.520 --> 43:58.520
Your Star Man.

44:01.800 --> 44:03.800
I'm here.

44:29.680 --> 44:31.680
You sleep now.
