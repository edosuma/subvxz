WEBVTT

00:00.953 --> 00:02.178
He-Man.

00:02.220 --> 00:06.478
And the Masters of the Universe.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.378
I am Adam, Prince of Eternia.

00:08.420 --> 00:09.539
Defender of the

00:09.564 --> 00:11.778
secrets of Castle Grayskull.

00:11.820 --> 00:15.943
This is Cringer, my fearless friend.

00:15.986 --> 00:17.844
Fabulous secret powers were revealed

00:17.869 --> 00:19.978
to me the day I held aloft

00:20.020 --> 00:22.154
my magic sword and said,

00:22.179 --> 00:24.668
by the power of Grayskull.

00:27.420 --> 00:31.578
I have the power!

00:38.786 --> 00:39.913
Cringer became the

00:39.938 --> 00:41.978
mighty Battle Cat, and I became

00:42.020 --> 00:43.876
He-Man, the most

00:43.901 --> 00:46.402
powerful man in the universe.

00:49.286 --> 00:51.778
Only three others share this secret:

00:52.620 --> 00:54.851
Our friends the Sorceress,

00:54.876 --> 00:56.911
Man-at-Arms, and Orko.

00:56.935 --> 00:59.588
Together we defend Castle Grayskull from,

00:59.613 --> 01:02.117
the evil forces of Skeletor.

01:27.726 --> 01:29.193
They've seen us.

01:29.762 --> 01:32.925
Good! If He-Man is at the palace,
we'll draw him out for sure.

01:33.599 --> 01:34.998
It's Tri-Klops.

01:35.200 --> 01:36.258
And Trap Jaw.

01:49.481 --> 01:51.813
By the power of Grayskull.

01:58.257 --> 02:02.421
I have the power!

02:19.111 --> 02:20.612
Mind if I tag along?

02:20.612 --> 02:22.307
Alright, but hang on tight.

02:36.528 --> 02:39.554
If we can just get his engine,
we can force him to land.

02:45.771 --> 02:46.999
Fire away, He-Man.

02:47.172 --> 02:50.539
I've seen every move
long before you make it.

02:53.779 --> 02:55.872
You can see everything, Tri-Klops...

02:56.014 --> 02:57.811
except what's right in front of you.

02:58.650 --> 02:59.617
What?

03:11.430 --> 03:12.221
Hold it!

03:12.798 --> 03:14.635
Unless you want me to use this freeze

03:14.660 --> 03:15.916
ray, you'll come quietly?

03:18.103 --> 03:19.866
After all this trouble,

03:19.891 --> 03:22.496
Skeletor's plan had better work.

03:26.912 --> 03:28.209
It's Trap Jaw.

03:30.983 --> 03:32.883
You forgot about me, didn't ya?

03:33.285 --> 03:36.152
Here's where I give you the hook, Trap Jaw.

04:00.712 --> 04:03.806
Here I am, hero. Come and get me.

04:07.786 --> 04:09.920
I'll go easy on you, He-Man,

04:09.945 --> 04:12.611
your sword against my energy bow.

04:14.593 --> 04:16.652
Whatever you say, metal-mouth.

04:27.739 --> 04:29.206
What is this?

04:30.242 --> 04:31.300
He-Man.

04:34.213 --> 04:35.874
I'll go after him.

04:36.482 --> 04:39.645
Let him go. I have what I came for.

04:39.952 --> 04:41.510
At long last, my revenge

04:41.535 --> 04:43.742
against He-Man will be complete.

04:44.089 --> 04:47.388
It's Skeletor. I should have known.

04:47.726 --> 04:49.366
Your mistake will cost you dearly,

04:49.391 --> 04:50.651
old enemy.

04:50.863 --> 04:52.491
I'm about to rid Eternia of

04:52.516 --> 04:54.323
your hated presence forever.

04:54.399 --> 04:56.802
You'll feel nothing, He-Man.

04:56.802 --> 04:59.293
But you will no longer be a problem to me.

04:59.471 --> 05:02.838
By the powers of darkness, evil and fear,

05:03.008 --> 05:07.775
I command He-Man's memory to now disappear.

05:12.084 --> 05:14.450
Oh no. What have they done?

05:14.553 --> 05:18.353
Doorway, now prove that Skeletor is clever.

05:18.524 --> 05:23.291
Sweep He-Man inside you
and hold him forever!

05:43.482 --> 05:45.677
Hey, w-w-where did he go?

05:45.884 --> 05:48.182
To the Crossroads of all Universes...

05:48.353 --> 05:51.151
where he is destined to spend
the rest of his days...

05:51.290 --> 05:54.020
wandering an alien world.

05:54.293 --> 05:57.524
Not knowing who he is
or where he came from.

05:57.796 --> 05:59.093
And now...

05:59.298 --> 06:00.322
Skeletor!

06:01.333 --> 06:02.823
Stay right where you are.

06:03.168 --> 06:05.136
Let me take care of them.

06:05.337 --> 06:07.237
Oh, no, you don't.

06:09.675 --> 06:12.838
We've done what we came to do. Let's go.

06:19.618 --> 06:24.715
Skeletor. Evil-Lyn!
Hey... hey what about me?

06:29.795 --> 06:33.060
Don't get any smart ideas
about biting through the bars,

06:33.332 --> 06:35.027
because they're electrically charged.

06:35.300 --> 06:37.632
That takes care of Trap Jaw and Tri-Klops

06:37.869 --> 06:39.131
but what about He-Man?

06:39.504 --> 06:42.036
I'm going with Orko and the
others to speak to the Sorceress.

06:42.040 --> 06:45.532
Frankly, Skeletor's spell might
even be beyond her powers.

06:50.449 --> 06:53.179
It is a most difficult problem, my friends.

06:53.352 --> 06:56.651
With all the vast number of
worlds that make up the universe.

06:57.055 --> 07:02.118
Finding the one He-Man landed
on would be, virtually impossible.

07:02.928 --> 07:04.862
There must be something we can do?

07:05.163 --> 07:07.791
Well, there is one being I know who...

07:08.066 --> 07:11.058
observes all that happens in the cosmos.

07:11.303 --> 07:14.033
Only he could point the way to He-Man, now.

07:14.206 --> 07:17.903
Zodac, rider of the Cosmic spaceways,

07:18.143 --> 07:21.510
appear for us. We need you.

07:29.655 --> 07:32.180
My thanks Zodac, for coming so quickly.

07:32.290 --> 07:34.918
With the fate of Eternia's
champion at stake.

07:35.060 --> 07:36.550
I could do no less.

07:36.728 --> 07:38.195
Gee, Mr. Zodac.

07:38.363 --> 07:41.059
Sir, could you really bring back He-Man?

07:41.233 --> 07:42.962
Though I observe all that

07:42.987 --> 07:45.037
happens in the cosmos, Orko.

07:45.037 --> 07:47.232
I cannot use my powers to change things.

07:47.339 --> 07:50.365
I can, however, give you this.

07:51.543 --> 07:54.637
The wand will work with your
magic and will guide you.

07:54.846 --> 07:56.871
I can tell you no more than that.

07:57.349 --> 08:00.750
You mean we have to depend on Orko's magic?

08:00.919 --> 08:02.614
We're doomed.

08:02.888 --> 08:06.289
Orko, Cringer and Ram-Man
must make the journey.

08:06.992 --> 08:10.018
You will be needed here, Man-At-Arms.
-I understand.

08:10.429 --> 08:11.987
Now hurry, my friends.

08:12.197 --> 08:14.757
I sense He-Man is in great danger.

08:33.919 --> 08:36.352
Where... where am I?

08:36.488 --> 08:38.388
What am I doing with this?

08:41.493 --> 08:44.860
Wait, don't run away.
What are you creatures?

08:45.097 --> 08:48.794
Stop, what are you doing?
You must be one of Plundor's evil goons.

08:49.334 --> 08:52.599
Well, I know how to deal with you, monster.

08:56.208 --> 08:59.700
I went easy on you this time.
But If I ever see you...

08:59.878 --> 09:01.743
harming another Shminavit.

09:01.847 --> 09:04.441
But I've never seen those
creatures before, I ...

09:04.816 --> 09:06.283
I don't even know where I am.

09:06.518 --> 09:10.318
And I suppose you're not one of
Plundor's hench-thugs, hmm... ?

09:10.689 --> 09:14.216
No, I, I don't know who I am.

09:14.793 --> 09:16.727
You remind me of someone...

09:17.028 --> 09:20.259
Someone I knew back, on...

09:20.532 --> 09:25.265
Now that you mention it, you do
look like a stranger to these parts.

09:25.470 --> 09:27.204
Why don't you come with me?
And we'll see

09:27.229 --> 09:29.191
if we can figure out where you belong.

09:29.241 --> 09:30.173
Yes.

09:39.618 --> 09:41.951
So that whiny do-gooder, Gleedil,

09:41.976 --> 09:44.170
has found herself a new friend.

09:44.956 --> 09:46.994
He's a powerful looking

09:47.019 --> 09:49.144
brute, whatever he is.

09:50.162 --> 09:51.935
Such a creature might

09:51.960 --> 09:53.986
be of great use to me.

09:54.432 --> 09:57.924
Me, Plundor the spoiler.

10:04.075 --> 10:06.805
N-n-n-no, I'm not going.

10:07.045 --> 10:09.275
Ah c'mon, you big 'fraidy cat.

10:09.481 --> 10:12.814
But I hate going through the time corridor.

10:12.951 --> 10:17.012
It's He-Man's only chance, my friends.
Good luck.

10:17.122 --> 10:19.105
Remember little one, He-Man will

10:19.130 --> 10:21.173
not know you when you find him.

10:21.359 --> 10:25.693
Tell him to talk of home and
perhaps it will help him remember.

10:25.864 --> 10:27.889
Talk of home? I got it.

10:28.099 --> 10:29.361
I think.

10:30.135 --> 10:33.332
But I get travel sick when I time-travel.

10:34.339 --> 10:36.398
Farewell, my friends.

10:37.008 --> 10:39.374
Hey. This is fun.

10:41.146 --> 10:44.707
Let me out! I wanna go home.

10:45.350 --> 10:46.977
Relax, Cringer.

10:46.985 --> 10:48.885
We probably won't meet anything more

10:48.910 --> 10:50.706
dangerous than a rabbit...
I hope.

11:02.701 --> 11:05.261
This is the only way to fly.

11:05.570 --> 11:10.633
Woo-woah, I think I'm getting travel sick.

11:11.142 --> 11:12.749
Look, guys, Zodac's wand is

11:12.774 --> 11:15.034
glowing, we must be close to He-Man.

11:15.780 --> 11:17.111
Hang on!

11:19.317 --> 11:20.249
O-Ow!

11:23.021 --> 11:27.151
Oh, I thought we cats
always landed on our feet.

11:29.794 --> 11:30.988
We're here.

11:31.263 --> 11:33.424
Uh, wherever here is.

11:33.832 --> 11:35.129
Hey guys,

11:35.634 --> 11:38.865
look at that swell
backscratcher someone lost.

11:39.137 --> 11:41.662
That's no backscratcher,
it's He-Man's sword!

11:41.973 --> 11:43.702
Can you follow his scent?

11:44.175 --> 11:47.972
I-I got a little cold,
but I'll give it a try.

11:58.723 --> 12:01.055
-Do you live here? -Yes.

12:01.359 --> 12:03.589
This planet is called Trannis.

12:03.728 --> 12:07.755
My name is Gleedil, I look after
the animals that live here...

12:07.966 --> 12:10.025
what's left of them, anyway.

12:10.168 --> 12:11.066
What happened?

12:11.403 --> 12:14.467
Once, Trannis was a beautiful green world.

12:16.238 --> 12:18.366
But that was before, Plundor took over.

12:26.685 --> 12:28.343
He used his evil machines to cut

12:28.368 --> 12:30.440
down the forests and spoil the rivers.

12:30.655 --> 12:35.058
With their homes and water gone,
the animals had to move on.

12:47.205 --> 12:50.299
Some of the animals died out completely,

12:50.508 --> 12:51.941
thanks to Plundor's destruction.

12:52.110 --> 12:54.943
These pictures are, all thats left of them.

12:55.213 --> 12:57.044
This one reminds me of...

13:05.357 --> 13:06.756
Plundor's droids!

13:11.196 --> 13:13.061
How did I do that?

13:18.036 --> 13:19.298
No... no.

13:20.477 --> 13:21.477
Sleep smoke.

13:34.919 --> 13:37.353
Duh, still no other sign of He-Man.

13:37.555 --> 13:41.491
This planet is so dirty I
can hardly smell anything.

13:41.659 --> 13:43.456
We've just gotta find him.

13:49.000 --> 13:51.696
It's a... it's a m-monster.

13:51.936 --> 13:54.302
I don't think this friendly
pooch would hurt anyone...

13:54.406 --> 13:57.304
in fact maybe you can ask
him, if he's seen He-Man, Cringer.

14:00.678 --> 14:02.873
Grr? Growl?

14:03.181 --> 14:04.671
Snarl?

14:08.153 --> 14:11.020
He says his mistress and He-Man...

14:11.156 --> 14:13.954
were taken away by a giant robot.

14:17.762 --> 14:21.721
Rise and shine. Time to get up.

14:28.039 --> 14:30.439
Greetings, stranger...

14:30.642 --> 14:33.873
I'm Plundor, the rightful ruler of Trannis.

14:34.279 --> 14:36.440
The rightful destroyer, you mean.

14:36.781 --> 14:39.045
Oh, since you don't like what I've

14:39.070 --> 14:41.139
done to the outside, Gleedil...

14:41.286 --> 14:42.719
you'll be happy to know...

14:42.921 --> 14:47.189
I've got a lovely spot
picked out for you in my dungeon.

14:47.358 --> 14:50.985
You don't have to
share Gleedil's fate, stranger.

14:51.762 --> 14:53.252
Oh, how would you like to help me...

14:53.331 --> 14:57.324
become the richest man in the universe.

14:57.669 --> 14:58.931
What do you mean?

14:59.070 --> 15:04.030
Ah, in this container is the
life force of this planet.

15:04.242 --> 15:09.145
Using my evil powers, I've turned
it, into a magic liquid...

15:09.314 --> 15:12.477
which I can sell for millions.

15:13.418 --> 15:15.386
Even billions.

15:18.623 --> 15:20.250
I'll make a fortune.

15:20.859 --> 15:24.761
You'll destroy a whole world
just for wealth and treasures?

15:24.863 --> 15:27.024
I'd do anything for that.

15:31.102 --> 15:35.236
He.. He says, He-Man is
inside that frightening place.

15:35.307 --> 15:38.208
Well, what are we waiting for?
Let's knock him outta there.

15:38.610 --> 15:39.907
No, Ram-Man.

15:40.044 --> 15:41.409
We gotta play it smart.

15:41.613 --> 15:42.580
Sneak up on 'em...

15:42.680 --> 15:44.375
and take 'em by surprise.

15:45.039 --> 15:46.039
Yeow!

15:46.921 --> 15:47.921
Aah!

15:51.456 --> 15:55.415
Well, stranger.
What is your answer going to be?

15:55.593 --> 15:58.426
I could use those muscles of yours.

15:59.264 --> 16:02.028
I may not remember where I came
from, or even what my name is...

16:02.901 --> 16:05.768
but I know what you're doing
to this world is wrong.

16:06.004 --> 16:08.507
Oh, then you and Gleedil can both

16:08.532 --> 16:11.660
stay in my dungeon, forever.

16:15.880 --> 16:17.814
Ah! What's happening?

16:18.049 --> 16:20.711
He-Man! Look. It's us.

16:20.818 --> 16:21.842
He-Man?

16:22.220 --> 16:25.712
Oh, my robot guards will
take care of you intruders.

16:26.858 --> 16:29.520
He-Man,
can't you remember anything?

16:29.694 --> 16:30.786
Do I know you?

16:30.929 --> 16:32.829
Zodac said, I should talk of home,

16:32.997 --> 16:34.692
and your memory might come back?

16:34.933 --> 16:37.527
But I, I can't remember where my home is.

16:41.739 --> 16:43.798
I'll take care o' these guys.

16:51.649 --> 16:54.482
Speak of home. Speak of home.

16:54.652 --> 16:57.382
Of course. Where else would
you be more at home, than...

16:57.555 --> 16:59.648
Castle Grayskull! Quick, follow me.

17:12.002 --> 17:13.698
Help... help!

17:14.405 --> 17:16.635
Now hold the sword up and say:

17:16.773 --> 17:19.902
By the power of Grayskull.

17:20.912 --> 17:23.904
By the power of Grayskull.

17:27.919 --> 17:31.582
I have the power!

17:35.660 --> 17:36.820
Orko.

17:37.328 --> 17:40.388
Hurray! the power of Grayskull
brought your memory back.

17:40.798 --> 17:43.459
Now, let's go to work.
We need your help.

18:14.666 --> 18:17.726
Those aliens are turning my robots to junk!

18:17.902 --> 18:21.565
But they won't get my magic liquid.

18:31.316 --> 18:34.080
If I can't get rich from my magic liquid...

18:34.252 --> 18:36.277
then nobody will have it.

18:58.710 --> 19:00.803
Time to get off this joyride.

19:24.836 --> 19:26.235
Thanks to you, He-Man.

19:26.404 --> 19:29.373
Our world is pure and clean again...

19:29.574 --> 19:32.202
and once Plundor's evil
factory is destroyed...

19:32.310 --> 19:34.335
your planet should be
totally back to normal.

19:34.445 --> 19:37.710
As a matter of fact,
I have an unwilling volunteer...

19:37.815 --> 19:40.147
working on that right now.

19:51.028 --> 19:53.428
That reminds me,
we have a score to settle...

19:53.531 --> 19:56.364
with an old friend named
Skeletor, back on our world.

19:56.467 --> 19:59.061
Is the time corridor
ready for Eternia, Orko?

19:59.737 --> 20:01.932
All set. Where's Ram-Man?

20:07.645 --> 20:09.510
I'll say one thing for these guys.

20:10.415 --> 20:12.610
They sure know how to have fun.

20:13.017 --> 20:14.382
C'mon, friends.

20:14.886 --> 20:15.978
Let's go home.

20:32.103 --> 20:34.970
In today's story,
He-Man came to the aid of a planet...

20:35.072 --> 20:38.337
whose natural resources were being wasted.

20:39.744 --> 20:42.713
Unfortunately,
this same waste is happening now...

20:42.980 --> 20:45.915
and not on a distant planet,
but right here on Earth.

20:46.184 --> 20:50.018
We must respect the plants and
animals before they disappear,

20:50.121 --> 20:51.952
as some species already have.

20:52.523 --> 20:55.788
There's beauty all around us. Protect it,

20:55.960 --> 20:57.825
before it's too late.
