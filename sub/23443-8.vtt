18:22.000 --> 18:23.202
{\an1}Dude, mind if
we cut in?

18:23.268 --> 18:25.070
{\an3}- But Becky and I
are playing--

18:25.137 --> 18:27.206
{\an1}- No, totally, dude.
I get that.

18:27.272 --> 18:29.608
{\an1}It's just that you only have
one friend over,

18:29.675 --> 18:31.677
and I have four.

18:34.480 --> 18:36.381
{\an3}- Can you please pass
the remote, Lynn?

18:36.448 --> 18:38.550
{\an3}It's time
for my fashion-show show.

18:38.617 --> 18:41.086
{\an8}- [mimics buzzer]
I have three friends over,

18:41.153 --> 18:43.222
{\an8}so I get the TV.
Thank you.

18:43.288 --> 18:45.591
- Three?
Oh, that's so cute.

18:45.657 --> 18:47.359
I have five.

18:47.426 --> 18:49.695
Wait...

18:49.761 --> 18:51.463
Yeah, five.

18:52.264 --> 18:55.167
{\an3}- Excuse me, Leni,
my friends and I have to watch

18:55.234 --> 18:56.602
our dating advice show.

18:56.668 --> 18:59.137
- Sorry, Lori.
I have five friends over and--

18:59.204 --> 19:00.572
- Oh.
Only five?

19:03.609 --> 19:05.410
{\an3}I'll save you the trouble--
there are six of them.

19:05.477 --> 19:07.112
Remote, please.

19:07.846 --> 19:10.382
{\an8}- Pardon the intrusion,

19:10.449 --> 19:12.651
{\an9}But it's time for
the congressional hearings.

19:12.718 --> 19:14.520
{\an8}- But, Lisa--

19:14.586 --> 19:17.289
{\an9}- Lucky seven, baby.
Count 'em.

19:17.356 --> 19:20.192
{\an8}- Move it, Lisa.
My eight friends and I

19:20.259 --> 19:22.261
{\an8}want to watch
"Prison Pageants."

19:22.327 --> 19:24.997
- Sorry, Lola,
but my nine friends and I

19:25.063 --> 19:27.699
would like to watch
"Vampires of Melancholia."

19:27.766 --> 19:30.469
- Hit the road, Jack.
My ten friends and I

19:30.536 --> 19:32.037
have a concert to watch.

19:32.104 --> 19:35.240
- Everyone "nose"
that 11 is more than 10.

19:35.307 --> 19:37.676
And we have a comedy special
to watch.

19:37.743 --> 19:40.012
{\an1}- You guys, this is
literally out of control.

19:40.078 --> 19:42.180
{\an1}Lana, did you really
have to invite 12

19:42.247 --> 19:43.415
of your muddy friends over?

19:43.482 --> 19:44.750
{\an8}- Don't bark at me.

19:44.816 --> 19:48.020
{\an8}Lincoln invited 13 randos over
from the arcade.

19:48.086 --> 19:50.289
{\an8}I bet you don't even know
all their names.

19:50.355 --> 19:51.490
{\an8}- I do too.

19:51.557 --> 19:53.592
{\an8}There's Jeff--
or is it Josh?

19:53.659 --> 19:56.662
{\an7}- By my calculations, with this
many people in the house,

19:56.728 --> 19:59.164
{\an7}we could be approaching
a threat level of...

19:59.231 --> 20:00.799
{\an8}stampeding T-Rex.

20:00.866 --> 20:03.135
{\an8}- Hey, I was watching that!
- Too bad.

20:03.201 --> 20:05.404
{\an8}- No, too bad for you!
- Give me the remote.

20:05.470 --> 20:07.306
{\an8}I want to watch
the sports channel.

20:07.372 --> 20:10.042
{\an7}- Uh-oh.
Make that erupting volcano.

20:10.108 --> 20:13.378
[pummeling and yelling]

20:13.445 --> 20:14.713
- That's just great, Lincoln.

20:14.780 --> 20:17.282
Those complete strangers
you invited into our home

20:17.349 --> 20:18.617
just started a fight.

20:18.684 --> 20:20.519
- Jim would never do that.

20:20.586 --> 20:22.788
It was probably
Lola's pageant group.

20:22.854 --> 20:24.089
They looked vicious.

20:24.156 --> 20:25.457
{\an8}- [scoffs] My money's on

20:25.524 --> 20:27.793
{\an8}Lynn's meathead jock friends.

20:27.859 --> 20:29.061
{\an7}- Ugh.

Open up.

Break it up.

- Stop shoving me.

20:49.247 --> 20:50.549
- Wait, Leni.

20:50.616 --> 20:53.085
{\an1}You don't leave.
You live here.

20:53.151 --> 20:54.653
- Oh, right.

20:55.687 --> 20:57.422
- What is going on here?

20:57.489 --> 21:00.859
{\an1}Why are there 65 kids
walking out of our house?

21:00.926 --> 21:02.361
- Are you the parents?

21:02.427 --> 21:04.429
{\an1}I'm afraid you've got
a $200 ticket

21:04.496 --> 21:05.697
for noise violation.

21:05.764 --> 21:08.467
{\an1}Try to keep your kids
under control.

21:08.533 --> 21:10.402
- Anyone care to explain?

21:11.236 --> 21:15.207
{\an3}- I will. I've got the story
down pretty well by now.

21:16.308 --> 21:17.776
And now you're caught up.

21:17.843 --> 21:20.779
- Well, you guys are going
to have to use your allowances

21:20.846 --> 21:23.115
to pay for this ticket.

21:23.181 --> 21:24.783
{\an3}- And I hope you've learned
your lesson.

21:24.850 --> 21:26.284
{\an8}- Definitely.

21:26.351 --> 21:27.886
{\an8}We're done playing
the friend card.

21:27.953 --> 21:30.322
{\an8}In fact, we fold.

why don't we just take turns

21:34.359 --> 21:35.627
{\an8}choosing what show to watch

21:35.694 --> 21:37.729
{\an8}and who gets to lick
the beaters and junk.

21:37.796 --> 21:39.364
{\an8}- Pretty sweet idea.

21:39.431 --> 21:41.400
{\an8}We can start
with dinner tonight.

21:41.466 --> 21:44.670
{\an8}- Lori, you're the oldest.
Why don't you go first?

21:44.736 --> 21:46.505
{\an9}- Ooh, okay.
I think we should have--

21:46.571 --> 21:48.440
{\an9}- Um, sorry, honey.
Tonight's dinner

21:48.507 --> 21:51.777

We're having goulash.
