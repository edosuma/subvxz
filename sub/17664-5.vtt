18:08.755 --> 18:10.837
l have returned to London

18:11.341 --> 18:13.957
to visit my mother, Queen Mary,

18:14.678 --> 18:20.344
whom I'm delighted to say has made
such good improvement in recent days.

18:20.976 --> 18:22.136
Thank you very much.

18:41.162 --> 18:42.902
My dearest, darling one,

18:44.165 --> 18:47.293
London is as awful and hellish

18:47.377 --> 18:51.165
and as full of my smug,
stinking relations as ever.

18:52.674 --> 18:55.381
Each day I call on Mama in the afternoon,

18:56.136 --> 18:59.720
and although she doesnâ€™t look quite
as bad as the doctors warned me,

19:00.598 --> 19:02.930
sheâ€™ll never again be able to leave her rooms,

19:03.727 --> 19:05.513
far less go out in public.

19:24.080 --> 19:25.069
What?

19:28.084 --> 19:29.460
(WEAKLY) Don't go.

19:33.006 --> 19:34.792
Not going anywhere, Mummy.

19:39.637 --> 19:42.470
DAVID: Itâ€™s one of the hardest things
Iâ€™ve ever had to endure.

19:43.308 --> 19:46.596
Spending so much time with a woman
who has been so vicious

19:47.145 --> 19:51.434
and inhumane to you, my beloved,
is wearing me down.

19:51.608 --> 19:52.597

19:52.734 --> 19:53.940

19:59.199 --> 20:03.112
-Sorry to disturb you, Your Royal Highness.
-What is it?

20:03.203 --> 20:06.286
The Archbishop of Canterbury's
private secretary called, sir,

20:06.373 --> 20:08.739
requesting a meeting
between you and His Grace.

20:09.292 --> 20:10.407
Oh? What about?

20:10.919 --> 20:12.125
Didn't say, sir.

20:12.879 --> 20:14.540
He hoped you could make tomorrow.

20:15.965 --> 20:21.005
Fine, I have a few errands planned,
but the Archbishop can come to lunch.

20:21.096 --> 20:24.509
As a matter of fact, they suggested 4:00 pm.

20:24.599 --> 20:27.386
Well, all right. We'll give him tea.

20:27.977 --> 20:29.513
At Lambeth Palace.

20:32.482 --> 20:33.562
Of course.

20:35.610 --> 20:39.444
Now I'm no longer King, I go to them.

20:42.992 --> 20:44.198
Thank you.

20:44.994 --> 20:46.780

DAVID: Goodness. What is this?

21:29.539 --> 21:31.700
-An ambush?
-ARCHBISHOP: Not at all, sir.

21:32.250 --> 21:35.742
No, just a gathering of old friends
who have come together

21:35.879 --> 21:39.417
to appeal to you in person,

21:39.507 --> 21:43.091
in the hope that you will do what we all think

21:44.095 --> 21:45.551
would be... (CLICKS TONGUE)

21:47.807 --> 21:48.922
The right thing.

21:51.394 --> 21:52.600
Regarding what?

21:53.438 --> 21:54.894
The coronation.

21:58.026 --> 21:59.562
What about the coronation?

22:04.073 --> 22:07.657
We acknowledge... As a...

22:09.162 --> 22:13.906
As a member of the Queen's close family,
you are entitled to attend,

22:15.001 --> 22:18.960
but also feel that the attendance

22:19.047 --> 22:21.584
at this sacred ceremony

22:22.258 --> 22:24.635
by one who, however good his reasons,

22:25.470 --> 22:28.382
did not feel capable

22:29.474 --> 22:31.055
of undertaking

22:31.851 --> 22:34.137
the obligations himself...

22:36.439 --> 22:39.522
It could strike a wrong note

22:40.360 --> 22:42.521
and would be deeply upsetting.

22:42.612 --> 22:44.022
To whom?

22:44.113 --> 22:46.729
-TOMMY: To everyone concerned.
-I didn't ask you, Tommy.

22:48.243 --> 22:49.949
This is Cookie's work, isn't it?

22:50.745 --> 22:52.076
The Queen Mother's?

22:52.872 --> 22:55.705
It's got her pudgy little fingers all over it.

22:55.792 --> 23:00.957
She asked you to do her dirty work for her
and you agreed, Archbishop, shame on you.

23:01.130 --> 23:05.339
lwill attend if I want.
And I do want and so does my wife.

23:05.468 --> 23:07.550
Alas, no, sir.

23:08.471 --> 23:12.635
Of course the Royal Family is obliged
to extend an invitation to you,

23:12.725 --> 23:13.840
as a Royal Duke.

23:13.935 --> 23:17.143
But that obligation does not extend
to the Duchess of Windsor.

23:17.981 --> 23:21.894
And it is my duty to inform you
on behalf of the Royal Family

23:21.985 --> 23:26.069
and the government, with whom
we have worked in close consultation,

23:26.155 --> 23:28.988
that she will not be offered an invitation.

23:30.159 --> 23:31.569
Oh, that's madness.

23:35.498 --> 23:39.491
The pusillanimity and vindictiveness
knows no limits.

23:40.169 --> 23:44.378
Seventeen years have elapsed
since the abdication.

23:46.968 --> 23:49.004
Shouldn't bygones be bygones?

23:49.095 --> 23:51.051
Some things can never be forgotten.

23:51.264 --> 23:53.505
Which of us, for example,
has forgotten the Somme?

23:53.683 --> 23:59.303
You would compare the love
and public commitment I made to my wife

23:59.522 --> 24:01.979
to slaughter in a World War?

24:20.877 --> 24:24.040
Why not use a celebration

24:24.839 --> 24:26.454
such as this,

24:27.383 --> 24:31.251
the investiture of a new Sovereign,
a beautiful young child,

24:31.346 --> 24:35.885
symbol of modernity, change and progress,
to turn a page?

24:38.436 --> 24:40.722
Surely the sophistication of a society

24:40.813 --> 24:44.522
can be measured by its tolerance
and ability to forgive.

24:44.609 --> 24:46.270
Its weakness, too.

24:46.653 --> 24:49.816
Sometimes lines just need to be drawn.

24:49.906 --> 24:53.694
You know, Tommy, you're an embarrassment
to the institution you serve,

24:53.826 --> 24:57.193
and to the country
that institution serves in turn.

24:57.288 --> 25:01.076
And I will take a lecture on national
embarrassment from many people, sir,

25:01.167 --> 25:02.407
but not from you.

25:04.295 --> 25:07.583
Let's face it, this whole thing is a charade.

25:08.257 --> 25:10.999
You knew already the answer to the choice
you have given me.

25:11.094 --> 25:15.007
It is simply the same as the choice
that caused all this offense in the first place.

25:15.098 --> 25:20.513
Namely, would I do anything that excludes
or disrespects the woman I love?

25:20.603 --> 25:26.690
No, never. lwill therefore not be attending
the coronation of my own niece.

25:27.193 --> 25:29.525
Whose favorite uncle I have always been.

25:29.612 --> 25:32.695
Hers, you should know,
was one of the strongest voices involved.

25:32.782 --> 25:34.397
Oh, was it indeed?

25:34.492 --> 25:37.359
Well, we know from where
she gets that ice in her veins.

25:37.453 --> 25:39.910
And it wasn't from my own dear,
weak brother.

25:39.997 --> 25:42.784
Nothing weak about the late King, sir.

25:43.668 --> 25:46.876
I'm sure I speak for everyone present
when I call him a hero.

oddly applicable to you, too.

26:38.014 --> 26:40.380
If I were to release a statement,

26:41.851 --> 26:43.341
could you have a look over it?

26:43.728 --> 26:44.934
Of course, sir.

26:48.191 --> 26:51.683
I'm aware that it's normal
for no reigning monarchs

26:51.778 --> 26:54.565
to be present at a coronation.

26:55.740 --> 26:59.858
Perhaps we could extend that
to include former kings, too.

27:00.828 --> 27:02.659
To spare my blushes.

27:02.872 --> 27:05.955
Might just throw
some of the vultures off the scent.

27:10.505 --> 27:12.041
It's an elegant solution, sir.

27:12.924 --> 27:16.633
And I'm quite sure Cabinet will support it.
Tommy?

27:18.262 --> 27:20.423
I'll speak to Their Majesties
and get back to you.

27:30.149 --> 27:32.265
We've just had a call
from Marlborough House.

27:33.402 --> 27:36.189
Regarding Her Majesty Queen Mary.

27:43.079 --> 27:45.115
DAVID: My own darling sweetheart.

27:46.624 --> 27:48.410
Well, at last itâ€™s all over.

27:49.919 --> 27:52.160
Mama took ill in the afternoon,

27:52.255 --> 27:54.667
then began hemorrhaging in the early hours.

27:55.758 --> 27:59.000
Doctors plied her
with tranquilizers and morphine

27:59.095 --> 28:01.006
to ensure there was no suffering.

28:01.931 --> 28:04.172
In the end, she passed in her sleep.

28:05.852 --> 28:07.137
l was sad, of course,

28:07.228 --> 28:11.847
but letâ€™s not forget
how she clung to such hatred for me,

28:11.941 --> 28:14.148
her eldest, till the last.

28:15.903 --> 28:20.067
Iâ€™m afraid her blood ran as icy cold
when she was alive

28:20.157 --> 28:21.818
as it does now sheâ€™s dead.

28:24.620 --> 28:27.862
Later in the day,
all the members of the family assembled

28:27.957 --> 28:31.541

possessions they would most like.

29:26.223 --> 29:31.843
something of the great reigns
of Queen Victoria and George V

29:31.938 --> 29:34.429
seemed to live on with her,

29:35.733 --> 29:40.352
proving that character is, as it will remain,

29:41.864 --> 29:44.526
the essential strength of British monarchy.

29:46.160 --> 29:50.529
Wherever she went,
she was assured of an applause

29:50.623 --> 29:56.835
which sprang from some
deep-seated affection and respect.

29:56.921 --> 29:58.377
Have you noticed?

29:58.589 --> 30:00.796
Identical to the funeral of your father.

30:00.883 --> 30:03.124
Nothing different. Not one detail.

30:03.469 --> 30:04.879
Not one guest.

30:07.390 --> 30:09.722
And she always regarded herself

30:10.685 --> 30:13.142
as a servant of our country,

30:13.229 --> 30:16.062
which she served to the end.

No sooner does someone in the family

"Right. How was it done last time?

"Let's do it exactly the same way again."

to share in it are locked outside.

should reflect that.

to be working with all the great minds
and talents here in this room today

as we come together to organize
the very best coronation for my wife,

33:21.250 --> 33:22.285
Queen.

33:24.628 --> 33:27.370
We all know the scale of the challenge
that faces us.

33:28.174 --> 33:31.382
The eyes of the world will be on us,
Britain will be on show

33:31.468 --> 33:35.086
and we must put our best foot fonNard.

33:37.099 --> 33:40.683
In such circumstances, the temptation

33:40.769 --> 33:43.602
is to roll out the red carpet
and follow the precedent

33:43.689 --> 33:48.149
set by the grand and successful coronations
of the past.

33:49.028 --> 33:54.068
But looking to the past for our inspiration
would be a mistake, in my view.

33:59.455 --> 34:02.788
Assumptions made at the time
of my father-in-Iaw's coronation

34:02.875 --> 34:05.958
17 years ago cannot be made anymore.

34:07.713 --> 34:10.625
That is why I think
we should adapt this ceremony.

34:13.552 --> 34:17.215
Make it less ostentatious. More egalitarian.

34:17.306 --> 34:20.594

and sensitivity to the real world.

35:59.366 --> 36:01.197
BERNARD: We can both see
whatâ€™s going on here.

36:01.285 --> 36:03.617
A young couple are playing marital games

36:03.746 --> 36:07.284
with the most cherished parts
of our history and pageantry.

36:08.834 --> 36:12.418
Our Queen wouldn't agree with
a single one of these radical proposals.

36:13.088 --> 36:15.420
Television being just the tip of the iceberg.

36:19.261 --> 36:22.094
She's simply trying to keep peace
in her own bedchamber

36:22.598 --> 36:26.136
by promoting her husband,
keeping him happy and occupied,

36:26.226 --> 36:27.477
and virile.

36:30.439 --> 36:32.225
That's what's going on here, Winston.

36:32.775 --> 36:35.812
Why? What else has he proposed?

36:40.783 --> 36:42.774
-Prime Minister.
-Your Majesty.

37:02.096 --> 37:04.382
Please tell me this has nothing to do
with my husband.

37:06.266 --> 37:07.802
I told him not to go mad.

37:10.562 --> 37:14.271
No one is questioning
the Duke of Edinburgh's motives

37:14.358 --> 37:17.020
or the sincerity of his beliefs.

37:17.111 --> 37:19.648
I see. He went mad.

37:20.864 --> 37:23.241
The changes he is proposing

37:24.159 --> 37:26.366
to an ancient, sacred,

37:26.453 --> 37:30.037
never previously changed liturgy and text...

37:32.835 --> 37:35.076
It went from top to toe.

37:36.505 --> 37:39.747
And if it were just a business,
it would be applauded.

37:39.842 --> 37:42.925
But this isn't a business. It's the Crown.

37:45.848 --> 37:50.467
And one has to ask oneself,
what is the purpose of the Crown?

37:50.561 --> 37:53.098
What is the purpose of the monarchy?

37:54.189 --> 37:56.180
Does the Crown bend
to the will of the people

37:56.275 --> 37:58.687
to be audited and accountable?

38:00.446 --> 38:04.280
Or should it remain above temporal matters?

38:08.662 --> 38:10.118
What say you?

38:14.084 --> 38:15.324
No, ma'am.

38:16.503 --> 38:18.334

38:19.423 --> 38:21.835

All right.

39:27.658 --> 39:30.741
-What is this? Hide and seek?
-I told you not to overstep the mark.

39:30.827 --> 39:32.954

If you want to stay on the throne, yes.

39:37.918 --> 39:40.034
In a trimmed-down televised coronation?

39:40.128 --> 39:43.165
If you want to avoid a revolution, yes.
You forget.

39:43.257 --> 39:46.499
I have seen first-hand what it is like
for a royal family to be overthrown

39:46.593 --> 39:48.675
because they were out of step
with the people.

39:48.762 --> 39:51.879
I left Greece in an orange crate.
My father would have been killed.

39:51.974 --> 39:53.180
My grandfather was.

39:53.600 --> 39:55.181
I'm just trying to protect you.

39:55.269 --> 39:57.476
From whom? The British people?

39:57.563 --> 39:59.770
You have no idea who they are
or what they want.

39:59.856 --> 40:04.441
Oh, oh, I'm just Johnny Foreigner, again,
who doesn't understand. Fine, fine.

40:04.528 --> 40:06.769
You want a big overblown ceremony
costing a fortune

40:06.863 --> 40:09.900
while the rest of the country
is on rations, have it.

But don't come bleating to me

40:12.035 --> 40:15.527
when your head and the heads
of our children are on spikes.

40:15.622 --> 40:18.329
If the people are hungry,
they want something that lifts them up.

40:18.667 --> 40:22.501
And how do you propose lifting them
if they cannot see it?

40:23.088 --> 40:25.921
The people look to the monarchy
for something bigger than themselves.

40:26.008 --> 40:28.090
An inspiration. A higher ideal.

40:28.176 --> 40:30.132
If you put it in their homes,

40:30.220 --> 40:32.176
allow them to watch it
with their dinner on their laps...

40:32.264 --> 40:36.257
It will democratize it, make them feel
that they share in it, understand it.

40:36.351 --> 40:37.932
All right!

40:39.605 --> 40:41.891
All right. I'll support you in the televising.

40:46.153 --> 40:47.484
You won't regret it.

40:48.864 --> 40:50.104
On one condition.

40:53.327 --> 40:54.737
That you kneel.

41:07.424 --> 41:08.413
Who told you?

41:09.718 --> 41:11.128
My Prime Minister.

41:12.179 --> 41:15.091
-He said you intended to refuse.
-No, I merely asked the question

41:15.182 --> 41:18.049
whether it was right in this day and age
that the Queen's consort,

41:18.143 --> 41:22.933
her husband, should kneel to her
rather than stand beside her.

41:23.023 --> 41:25.139
You won't be kneeling to me.

41:25.233 --> 41:27.440
That's not how it will look.
That's not how it will feel.

41:27.527 --> 41:30.735
It will feel like a eunuch,
an amoeba, is kneeling before his wife.

41:30.822 --> 41:33.734
You'll be kneeling before God
and the Crown, as we all do.

41:33.825 --> 41:35.361
I don't see you kneeling before anyone.

41:35.452 --> 41:38.194
I'm not kneeling because I'm already
flattened under the weight of this thing.

41:38.288 --> 41:40.995
Oh, spare me the false humility.
Doesn't look like that to me.

41:41.083 --> 41:43.495
-How does it look to you?
-Looks to me like you're enjoying it.

41:43.585 --> 41:46.827
It's released an unattractive sense
of authority and entitlement

41:46.922 --> 41:48.253
that I have never seen before.

41:48.340 --> 41:51.207
And in you, it's released a weakness
and insecurity I've never seen before.

41:51.301 --> 41:54.259
-Are you my wife or my Queen?
-l'm both.

41:54.346 --> 41:56.507
I want to be married to my wife.

41:56.598 --> 41:59.340
I am both and a strong man
would be able to kneel to both.

-I will not kneel before my wife.
-Your wife is not asking you to.
