02:01.000 --> 02:03.230
Let us finish it.

02:19.202 --> 02:23.122
- Perhaps it is a trap.
- It is.

02:23.202 --> 02:25.462
Then what do we do?

02:26.462 --> 02:28.583
We break through.

03:25.488 --> 03:27.198
There!

03:27.278 --> 03:29.488
I see him.

03:44.630 --> 03:46.460
Pagans!

03:57.021 --> 03:59.521
- Forward still.
- Retreat!

03:59.601 --> 04:02.402
No! Do not stop.

04:22.793 --> 04:27.634
We are her salvation, and through
her command we shall live forever.

04:27.714 --> 04:30.594
I will not die.
Not here, not now!

04:30.684 --> 04:33.264
Never!

06:57.838 --> 07:00.258
No!

07:13.020 --> 07:15.070
We're almost there.

07:57.074 --> 08:00.954
You'll make it.
I won't let you die.

08:27.817 --> 08:30.107
You're strong enough.

08:30.187 --> 08:33.107
Finish it.

08:46.458 --> 08:50.209
Don't worry.
We'll be all right.

08:50.669 --> 08:53.379
I just need to take a little.

09:37.603 --> 09:39.894
Finish it.

09:49.944 --> 09:53.245
- Hey, what are you doing here?
- Take a walk with me.

09:53.325 --> 09:55.325
- I have to work.
- It's the first snow...

09:55.415 --> 09:58.745
Yeah, I know, but they're waiting on me.

09:58.835 --> 10:01.706
- Come on, Tommy.
- Please, Izzi.

10:05.336 --> 10:07.216
I'm sorry.

10:07.296 --> 10:09.296
I am.

10:12.927 --> 10:15.267
I'll see you tonight.

12:52.812 --> 12:55.152
Finish it.

12:57.362 --> 12:59.782
Please, leave me alone.

13:00.863 --> 13:03.863
I don't know how it ends.

13:35.026 --> 13:36.986
All right.

13:37.986 --> 13:39.616
I trust you.

13:39.696 --> 13:41.736
Take me.

13:44.327 --> 13:46.327
Show me.

13:54.008 --> 13:56.178
- What are you doing here?
- Take a walk with me.

13:56.258 --> 13:58.218
- I have to work.
- It's the first snow...

13:58.298 --> 14:01.098
Yeah, I know, but they're waiting on me.

14:01.178 --> 14:04.349
- Come on, Tommy.
- Please, Izzi.

14:06.019 --> 14:07.399
I'm sorry.

14:07.479 --> 14:09.859
I am.

14:10.899 --> 14:13.189
I'll see you tonight, OK?

14:18.200 --> 14:19.410
Izzi.

14:19.660 --> 14:23.080
Hey! Dr Creo.
Antonio's on his way back.

14:23.160 --> 14:27.251
Donovan's open and ready.
His vitals are steady.

14:30.001 --> 14:31.041
Dammit.

14:31.131 --> 14:34.011
Come on.

14:34.091 --> 14:39.972
- Did he say if it was working?
- Just said to grab you and meet in Surgery.

14:44.142 --> 14:45.732
- Where is he?
- I'm not sure.

14:45.813 --> 14:47.983
- Call him.
- OK.

14:50.023 --> 14:53.403
Antonio sent me ahead with the scans.
He's still busy in Chem Lab.

14:53.483 --> 14:57.074
Breeny, it's Manny.
Where's Antonio?

14:57.204 --> 15:00.954
- It's still growing aggressively.
- That much in two days!

15:01.034 --> 15:03.994
What do you mean, you don't know?
Go get him. Find him.

15:07.045 --> 15:09.925
He's been lying open 50 minutes now.

15:12.045 --> 15:14.755
- He's crossing the street.
- The results?

15:14.845 --> 15:18.766
- I didn't ask.
- Meet him at the elevator. Get his ass in here.

15:20.766 --> 15:24.816
Micromanipulators at 42 degrees,
mediolateral, 72.

15:24.896 --> 15:26.646
Yup.

15:26.726 --> 15:29.947
How we doing, Donovan?
You hanging in?

15:34.197 --> 15:38.117
No good.
Great specificity, but no suppression.

15:44.088 --> 15:46.458
- Shall we close?
- No, euthanise.

15:46.548 --> 15:51.839
- Why?
- If we don't treat now, the growth gets him.

15:51.929 --> 15:53.849
Dammit!

16:38.103 --> 16:41.984
- I'll prepare the pentabarbital.
- No, wait.

16:46.944 --> 16:50.944
- What is it?
- That compound we played with last year.

16:51.034 --> 16:55.745
- Which one?
- From that tree from Central America.

16:58.205 --> 17:02.465
<i>- That one.
- "Natul tortuosa. 82-A46."</i>

17:02.545 --> 17:05.086
- From Guatemala.
- The old-growth tree.

17:05.175 --> 17:10.846
We had two samples, but it was sterile.
The graftings and clippings didn't take either.

17:10.925 --> 17:13.226
- That's it.
- What's happening?

17:13.306 --> 17:16.727
Mix it with your compound.
They've got a similar structure.

17:16.807 --> 17:20.817
- Manny, find those samples.
- I don't see it.

17:20.896 --> 17:24.988
Picture them side by side.
Fold them into each other like two lovers,

17:25.068 --> 17:27.568
woman on top.

17:27.657 --> 17:29.988
They have complementary domains.

17:30.078 --> 17:32.538
- If we can get them to stick...
- Is this it?

17:32.618 --> 17:36.789
- Go!
- We have no toxicity reports, not a single...

17:36.869 --> 17:41.049
It doesn't matter. Donovan's on the table.
If we do nothing, he dies.

17:41.129 --> 17:43.379
- Antonio, how long?
- Two hours.

17:43.459 --> 17:45.760
Keep him under.

17:52.060 --> 17:56.191
- I've never seen that adhesion pattern.
- What's it binding to it?

17:56.271 --> 18:01.981
I don't know. But it's definitely
attaching to the high-growth regions.

18:02.071 --> 18:04.071
Let's do it.

18:04.151 --> 18:06.492
.751, 1.25.

18:06.572 --> 18:10.162
- Syringe is loaded.
- Give it.

18:12.122 --> 18:14.082
Manny, give me light.

18:20.043 --> 18:22.043
Lowering.

18:23.053 --> 18:26.013
- Injecting.
- Injection at 23:57.

18:26.093 --> 18:30.054
- 23:57.
- Good boy, Donovan. Good boy.

18:46.865 --> 18:48.576
- What's up?
- My ring.

18:48.656 --> 18:50.036
- What ring?
- My wedding ring.

18:50.116 --> 18:54.126
- Where'd you leave it?
- Right there, where I always put it.

18:54.206 --> 18:58.416
- Someone must've knocked it on the ground.
- Tommy, may I have a word with you?

18:58.506 --> 19:01.007
- One second.
- What are you doing?

19:01.087 --> 19:04.677
- It's my ring. I put it there.
- It's gotta be here.

19:04.757 --> 19:09.137
- I need to talk to you.
- Don't worry about it. We'll find it.

19:12.898 --> 19:13.898
Tommy...

19:16.188 --> 19:19.278
- I'm concerned.
- What?

19:19.358 --> 19:24.579
I saw Betty in the hall. She was hysterical.
You've been running sloppy surgeries.

19:24.659 --> 19:28.249
- Nonsense!
- You injected an untested compound.

19:28.329 --> 19:30.920
He was open.
We were about to put him down.

19:31.000 --> 19:34.540
NIH could shut us down.
I should shut you down for it.

19:34.630 --> 19:38.380
You're reckless
and you're losing perspective.

19:43.301 --> 19:46.851
Look, why don't you just
take a few days at home.

19:48.221 --> 19:51.772
Spend a little time with Izzi.

19:51.852 --> 19:55.112
I'm here for her.

20:16.384 --> 20:18.384
Izzi.

20:23.385 --> 20:25.265
Izzi?

20:26.265 --> 20:28.105
Iz?

20:32.485 --> 20:34.356
Izzi?

20:37.696 --> 20:39.366
Izzi.

20:42.616 --> 20:44.366
Izzi!

20:47.997 --> 20:49.797
Izzi!

20:49.877 --> 20:51.797
- Tommy?
- Isabel!

20:57.968 --> 21:00.558
That's funny.
Very funny.

21:01.388 --> 21:03.478
What are you doing?

21:03.558 --> 21:07.519
I'm... I'm stargazing.
I found it in the attic.

21:07.609 --> 21:12.109
- Come on in. It's freezing.
- I want you to see something. Come on.

21:12.189 --> 21:15.069
You're an old fart.

21:19.330 --> 21:21.120
OK.

21:22.120 --> 21:23.750
OK.

21:26.250 --> 21:29.091
Go on. Look.

21:34.131 --> 21:35.841
- You see it?
- The gold star?

21:35.931 --> 21:41.512
It's actually a nebula wrapped around
a dying star. That's what makes it look gold.

21:42.722 --> 21:44.682
What?

21:44.772 --> 21:47.102
- I took science.
- When?

21:48.563 --> 21:51.073
Junior high.

21:55.113 --> 21:58.744
- The Mayans called it Xibalba.
- Xibalba?

22:00.534 --> 22:05.414
It was their underworld.
The place the dead souls go to be reborn.

22:06.124 --> 22:08.124
What? What are you talking about?

22:08.214 --> 22:10.135
My book.

22:10.215 --> 22:13.385
- I'm writing about it.
- I thought it took place in Spain.

22:13.465 --> 22:15.595
It begins there.

22:15.725 --> 22:17.975
Ends there.

22:18.055 --> 22:20.096
Are you done?

22:20.186 --> 22:22.686
- Almost.
- Good. When do I read it?

22:31.157 --> 22:36.037
Someday soon it will explode, die,
and give birth to new stars.

22:36.117 --> 22:41.288
How amazing that the Mayans chose
a dying star to represent their underworld.

22:41.378 --> 22:44.588
Of all the healthy points of light in the sky,

22:46.128 --> 22:48.218
how did they find one that was dying?

22:50.718 --> 22:53.139
Where are your shoes?

22:57.599 --> 23:01.229
Izzi! Come on, come on.
Let's warm you up.

23:03.770 --> 23:06.110
Whoa, whoa. Careful.

23:06.190 --> 23:08.190
OK. I'll get it.

23:09.490 --> 23:11.530
Careful. Iz?

23:14.581 --> 23:16.411
Stop. No!

23:16.491 --> 23:18.371
Get inside.

23:18.451 --> 23:20.501
Serves you right.

24:15.096 --> 24:17.437
Is she a redhead?

24:18.517 --> 24:20.487
What?

24:23.907 --> 24:26.278
I left it in Surgery.

24:26.368 --> 24:29.368
If you can't wait, you can't wait.

24:32.288 --> 24:34.868
I'm joking.

24:34.958 --> 24:38.709
- I'll make some coffee.
- Wait. The sponge.

24:42.839 --> 24:45.089
I want you to heat it.

25:15.332 --> 25:18.673
Outside, before,
you couldn't feel the cold.

25:18.753 --> 25:20.463
Tommy.

25:21.753 --> 25:25.303
- I'm calling Dr Lipper.
- No! I'm afraid.

25:26.973 --> 25:29.224
Jesus, I'm sorry.

25:33.224 --> 25:35.644
- It's been happening for a while.
- What?

25:35.734 --> 25:39.114
- I'm losing sensitivity to hot and cold.
- Why didn't you tell me?

25:39.194 --> 25:42.155
Because I feel different inside.

25:42.235 --> 25:44.945
I feel different.

25:45.035 --> 25:47.165
Every moment.

25:47.245 --> 25:49.495
Each one.

25:52.416 --> 25:54.086
Tommy?

26:05.557 --> 26:06.927
Oh, Jesus.

26:07.017 --> 26:10.517
Look, don't worry.
Don't worry. All right? I'm here.

26:10.607 --> 26:12.688
I will always be here.

26:17.238 --> 26:19.238
I know. Yes, I know, Iz.

26:38.590 --> 26:40.680
Got you.

27:39.576 --> 27:41.156
- Hello?
- Alan? Tommy.

27:41.246 --> 27:44.166
- Tommy.
- What's the earliest you can make tomorrow?

27:44.246 --> 27:49.127
- Let me check my schedule.
- It's time for you to read it.

27:49.207 --> 27:55.677
- Three? I'm in Surgery till then. Is it urgent?
- No, no. That's fine. Thanks, Alan. Bye.

27:55.757 --> 27:59.178
- We're going to see him tomorrow.
- Start it. Tell me what you think.

27:59.268 --> 28:02.268
- But it's not done.
- Not quite.

28:06.108 --> 28:09.399
Don't answer it.

28:09.479 --> 28:12.949
- Hello? Antonio, what's wrong?
- Can you get down here?

28:13.029 --> 28:15.659
- What is it?
- Donovan.

28:15.739 --> 28:17.739
- Is he OK?
- He's perfectly fine.

28:17.829 --> 28:20.080
- What's happening?
- You won't believe me.

28:20.160 --> 28:22.710
You've got to see for yourself.
Come right away.

28:24.620 --> 28:26.790
No, I can't now. I can't.

28:36.181 --> 28:39.512
- To Donovan!
- What's going on?

28:39.602 --> 28:42.182
- Show him.
- I came to check up on Donovan.

28:42.272 --> 28:45.562
- Where is Donovan?
- That's him.

28:46.602 --> 28:49.572
What? It can't be.

28:55.033 --> 28:57.493
He's almost healed.
There's hair growth.

28:57.573 --> 29:01.334
- I didn't believe it either.
- Antonio had me run some tests.

29:01.414 --> 29:04.544
Donovan responded well.
Really well.

29:05.464 --> 29:08.714
I pulled up videos of him pre-op.
He's testing twice as well.

29:08.794 --> 29:15.265
We're seeing an increase in neural activity
in all areas usually stunted by ageing.

29:19.645 --> 29:22.276
- And the tumour?
- No change.

29:24.526 --> 29:28.986
The growth patterns are normal.
There's no positive or negative effect.

29:29.066 --> 29:33.117
- We should tell Dr Guzetti right away.
- No! No.

29:41.127 --> 29:43.048
Antonio,

29:44.048 --> 29:46.798
prep a new cocktail.
Stick with the same substance.

29:46.878 --> 29:48.928
What?

29:49.008 --> 29:51.098
- We're moving forward.
- Wait.

29:51.178 --> 29:53.389
But this could be a medical first.

29:53.469 --> 29:56.979
A revelation! We've gotta pursue it
and duplicate the findings.

29:57.059 --> 30:00.809
We can monitor synaptic growth,
but our focus is tumours, not ageing.

30:00.899 --> 30:06.070
- I know, but...
- I want the next subject ready for surgery.

31:05.965 --> 31:09.016
- Is everything all right?
- Yes.

31:09.096 --> 31:11.436
Everything's all right.

33:08.017 --> 33:09.147
Inquisitor?

33:13.027 --> 33:15.188
Enter.

33:19.158 --> 33:21.198
The heretics.

33:21.278 --> 33:25.449
They have confessed
and ceded their lands to your holy office.

33:25.539 --> 33:28.119
They await yourjudgment.

33:28.539 --> 33:32.419
Yet another slice of her nation is mine.

33:35.380 --> 33:39.300
Soon she will be powerless against me.

33:41.180 --> 33:44.140
Queen of nothing but her sins.

33:45.101 --> 33:47.231
What will you do with her?

33:47.311 --> 33:50.981
She too will confess,
and then

33:51.941 --> 33:54.191
she too will die.

34:30.945 --> 34:33.905
Captain. 'Tis the queen.

34:33.985 --> 34:36.074
She is surrounded.

34:36.155 --> 34:38.866
The inquisitor demands blood.

34:44.916 --> 34:47.206
Then there is no more time.

34:52.717 --> 34:55.137
What is our response?

34:55.217 --> 34:58.057
Go now.
Warn the queen.

34:58.307 --> 35:01.478
- And you? Where are you going?
- He must be cut out.

35:01.558 --> 35:04.148
- She has forbidden it.
- There is no other choice.

35:04.228 --> 35:06.358
This is our only hope.

35:23.710 --> 35:26.340
Stay. Stay.

35:47.152 --> 35:52.153
Our bodies are prisons for our souls.

35:53.823 --> 35:59.293
Our skin and blood,
the iron bars of confinement.

36:00.953 --> 36:03.664
But fear not.

36:03.714 --> 36:05.834
All flesh decays.

36:06.834 --> 36:10.054
Death turns all to ash,

36:11.054 --> 36:13.765
and, thus,

36:13.805 --> 36:16.395
death frees every soul.

36:19.355 --> 36:23.186
You, the condemned,

36:23.276 --> 36:26.066
you have confessed.

36:26.156 --> 36:30.826
You admit to protecting a queen

36:31.986 --> 36:35.207
who twists the word of God

36:35.287 --> 36:38.747
and drowns all Spain in sin.

36:39.997 --> 36:46.258
Your queen seeks immortality on Earth -
a false paradise.

36:46.338 --> 36:49.098
This is heresy.

36:49.178 --> 36:51.758
She leads you towards vanity,

36:51.848 --> 36:54.768
away from the spirit.

36:54.849 --> 36:57.229
But this is foolishness,

36:57.349 --> 36:59.859
for death exists.

36:59.939 --> 37:02.279
The Day of Judgment is irrefutable.

37:03.279 --> 37:05.780
All life must be judged.

37:20.881 --> 37:22.961
- Why are you here?
- Come quickly.

37:23.051 --> 37:27.972
- Leave. Protect the queen.
- She sent me. She demands your return.

37:28.052 --> 37:31.892
- Not before he dies.
- No, Tomas. Leave him.

37:31.972 --> 37:34.852
She desires a private audience.

37:34.932 --> 37:40.483
But fear not.
She will not be in hell alone.

37:40.563 --> 37:44.193
I will make sure
her servants are waiting for her.

38:37.048 --> 38:40.088
Faithful servant, why do you cry?

38:40.168 --> 38:43.719
To see Spain brought so low,

38:43.799 --> 38:48.599
with an enemy thriving within her borders,
feasting on her strength.

38:48.679 --> 38:51.440
The shame is too much.
I've failed her.

38:51.520 --> 38:53.900
Dare not pity Spain.

38:56.190 --> 38:58.900
These times are dark,

38:58.940 --> 39:04.241
but every shadow, no matter how deep,
is threatened by morning light.

39:04.321 --> 39:06.531
Of course.

39:06.621 --> 39:09.041
This loyalty of yours

39:09.121 --> 39:12.672
inspires you to protect Spain at any cost,

39:14.132 --> 39:17.212
but killing the inquisitor is suicide.

39:18.342 --> 39:20.722
Europe would have my head.

39:21.762 --> 39:26.013
I, for one, am not ready to die yet.
Are you?

39:26.103 --> 39:28.683
I will die for Spain.

39:30.813 --> 39:33.274
I know, Conquistador.

39:33.354 --> 39:34.944
I know.

39:35.024 --> 39:39.074
And this bravery of yours,
it may save us yet.

39:40.234 --> 39:43.574
For Spain has a plan.

39:43.655 --> 39:46.785
There is hope.

39:46.875 --> 39:49.415
- There's hope?
- Father.

40:09.227 --> 40:13.027
I am Father Avila
of her royal Franciscan order.

40:13.107 --> 40:15.698
Our allegiance remains with Spain.

40:16.278 --> 40:17.698
Father.

40:17.778 --> 40:20.408
Guards, leave us.

40:24.788 --> 40:26.579
Conquistador,

40:26.669 --> 40:32.669
I am going to tell you the true reason
why the inquisitor pits cross against crown.

40:33.709 --> 40:39.100
One year ago, Father Avila returned
from the jungles of New Spain

40:39.140 --> 40:41.220
with a secret so great,

40:41.310 --> 40:44.890
it promised to free
all mankind from tyranny.

40:44.980 --> 40:48.981
Spain desired this treasure
above all things,

40:49.061 --> 40:52.361
but the inquisitor feared it
with equal measure.

40:52.441 --> 40:55.151
When I refused to give up my quest for it,

40:55.241 --> 41:00.202
he responded with this violent coup
to bring Spain to her knees.

41:00.282 --> 41:03.122
But we have not yielded,

41:03.202 --> 41:06.082
and now we will defeat him.

41:14.173 --> 41:17.433
This is our hope.

41:17.513 --> 41:21.474
- A dagger?
- Used in religious rituals.

41:21.554 --> 41:24.354
I took it from a dead Mayan priest.

41:27.314 --> 41:29.485
The marking on the hilt...

41:31.275 --> 41:34.235
Do you see it?

41:40.326 --> 41:42.336
It is a map.

41:43.036 --> 41:46.626
A map to the Mayans' greatest secret.

41:46.706 --> 41:52.087
Greater than Chichen Itzá, greater than
Yaxchilán, greater even than Tikal.

41:52.177 --> 41:57.177
Here, in the centre, in the core
of the once-great Mayan civilisation,

41:57.267 --> 42:01.598
we will find a lost pyramid.

42:02.648 --> 42:05.068
No.

42:05.148 --> 42:06.938
Not lost.

42:07.028 --> 42:12.489
Hidden.
The hidden pyramid of the Mayan myths.

42:12.569 --> 42:16.159
The myths tell us of a holy pyramid,

42:16.239 --> 42:18.999
built upon the navel of the Earth,

42:19.079 --> 42:22.040
the birthplace of life.

42:23.080 --> 42:25.710
A special tree sprouts there.

42:27.000 --> 42:31.090
They say whoever drinks of its sap

42:31.180 --> 42:34.221
will live forever.

42:35.721 --> 42:37.971
Eternal life?

42:39.101 --> 42:43.692
Spain hangs at the whims of a merciless
enemy and you taunt us with yarns?

42:43.772 --> 42:46.272
They are not yarns.

42:47.322 --> 42:49.692
Remember,

42:49.782 --> 42:52.072
our own Bible confirms it.

42:52.152 --> 42:56.083
In Genesis, there are two trees
in the Garden of Eden -

42:56.163 --> 43:00.043
the Tree of Knowledge
and the Tree of Life.

43:00.123 --> 43:03.373
When Adam and Eve disobeyed the Lord
and ate from the Tree of Knowledge,

43:03.463 --> 43:07.344
the Lord banned them from the garden
and hid the Tree of Life.

43:39.417 --> 43:41.507
Could it be?

43:46.638 --> 43:48.258
Could it be?

43:49.758 --> 43:52.178
Kneel, Conquistador.

43:57.479 --> 44:00.269
Let in the morning light.

44:16.540 --> 44:20.001
The beast runs amok in my kingdom.

44:21.001 --> 44:23.921
He has isolated me,

44:24.011 --> 44:29.102
and now he is sharpening his talons
for one more fateful push.

44:30.262 --> 44:34.182
But salvation lies
in the jungles of New Spain.

44:51.164 --> 44:54.204
Will you deliver Spain from bondage?

44:54.294 --> 44:57.214
Upon my honour and my life.

45:07.435 --> 45:12.316
Then you shall take this ring
to remind you of your promise.

45:15.316 --> 45:18.696
You shall wear it when you find Eden,

45:18.776 --> 45:21.197
and when you return,

45:21.277 --> 45:23.527
I shall be your Eve.

45:26.697 --> 45:29.707
Together, we will live forever.

45:46.309 --> 45:48.309
Iz?

45:51.019 --> 45:52.860
Izzi?

46:18.212 --> 46:21.132
- There you are.
- Hey, what are you doing here?

46:21.222 --> 46:26.103
- Babe, we have Lipper at three.
- This is an actual Mayan book.

46:26.183 --> 46:31.563
Look. It explains their creation myth. You see,
that's First Father. He's the very first human.

46:31.603 --> 46:33.903
Is he dead?

46:33.983 --> 46:37.574
He sacrificed himself to make the world.

46:38.194 --> 46:41.204
- The Tree of Life's bursting out of his belly.
- Come on.

46:41.284 --> 46:47.205
Listen. His body became the tree's roots.
They spread and formed the Earth.

46:47.295 --> 46:51.085
His soul became the branches,
rising up, forming the sky.

46:51.165 --> 46:53.715
All that remained
was First Father's head.

46:53.795 --> 46:57.716
His children hung it in the heavens,
creating Xibalba.

46:57.806 --> 47:00.216
Xibalba? The star.

47:00.306 --> 47:02.476
Nebula.

47:02.556 --> 47:05.096
- So what do you think?
- About?

47:05.186 --> 47:07.147
That idea.

47:07.227 --> 47:10.227
Death as an act of creation.

47:13.027 --> 47:15.237
Stay together, guys.

47:16.237 --> 47:19.908
I'll pull out the car
and meet you in front.

47:42.680 --> 47:44.730
Iz. Iz!

48:09.842 --> 48:12.133
- Tommy.
- Hey.

48:13.803 --> 48:15.553
Tommy.

48:22.354 --> 48:24.894
You're all right.

48:26.694 --> 48:29.194
- I'm close.
- No.

48:29.274 --> 48:31.025
There are options.

48:31.115 --> 48:34.945
- We'll have to make some choices.
- Alan?

48:37.115 --> 48:42.166
You had a minor seizure. The growth in
your brainstem's back and it's growing faster.

48:42.246 --> 48:44.506
- The next time...
- No!

48:45.506 --> 48:47.126
No.

48:47.216 --> 48:49.256
We had a breakthrough.

48:49.336 --> 48:52.217
I know I can translate it to help you.

48:52.307 --> 48:54.677
I just need a little more time, OK?

48:54.767 --> 48:58.057
There's hope.
There's real hope.

48:58.137 --> 49:01.267
- Tommy.
- What? What, baby?

49:05.738 --> 49:08.648
- I wasn't afraid.
- I know.

49:08.738 --> 49:11.368
You're very strong.

49:11.448 --> 49:13.279
No.

49:14.539 --> 49:17.539
- No.
- What?

49:17.619 --> 49:20.039
When I fell

49:21.959 --> 49:24.380
I was full.

49:26.800 --> 49:28.800
Held.

49:30.760 --> 49:33.720
I know.
I caught you. I held you.

49:40.351 --> 49:44.521
It's OK, Iz.
Everything's gonna be all right.

49:52.822 --> 49:54.952
There's time.
We have time.

50:25.155 --> 50:27.786
We need to examine
the hippocampal region.

50:27.866 --> 50:31.906
- What the hell's going on?
- I brought in Dean Katari and Dr...

50:31.996 --> 50:33.866
I'm sorry, what are you doing here?

50:35.206 --> 50:40.877
- Antonio and Betty were just showing me...
- Donovan's synaptic growth increased.

50:40.967 --> 50:44.257
His brain is identical to scans
from 12 years ago, when he was six.

50:44.887 --> 50:47.257
And the tumour?

50:51.678 --> 50:53.938
- Exactly. Please?
- Tommy...

50:54.018 --> 50:56.438
Please!

50:56.518 --> 51:01.439
Perhaps you should wait for me in my office.
Manny. I'll be right there.

51:01.529 --> 51:05.319
- Thomas, I'd like a word with you in private.
- After surgery.

51:17.630 --> 51:19.460
First cut.

51:22.261 --> 51:25.301
Tommy.
Dr Lipperjust called.

51:25.381 --> 51:31.392
He said Izzi's doing better and they're gonna
move her to a regular floor in the morning.

51:45.743 --> 51:49.493
When we're done here,
I want you to prep Cain.

51:54.374 --> 51:57.504
I'll get her.
She'll take care of it.

52:17.196 --> 52:20.116
What do you think you're doing?

52:20.196 --> 52:24.747
You don't abandon results like that.
You repeat the procedure, get a confirmation.

52:24.827 --> 52:30.327
Confirmation that the tumour's unaffected?
She'll be dead by then.

52:30.417 --> 52:32.417
Tommy.

52:36.008 --> 52:37.838
She had a seizure.

52:41.098 --> 52:43.508
I'm so sorry.

52:45.429 --> 52:47.769
- How's she doing?
- She's stable.

52:49.189 --> 52:51.189
Who's with her?

52:52.479 --> 52:55.110
- She's alone?
- She needs to rest.

52:55.190 --> 53:00.110
No one invents new drugs overnight. No one!
You're not being rational.

53:00.200 --> 53:03.160
- You can't fix everything!
- Don't tell me what I can do.

53:03.240 --> 53:09.461
- Your wife needs you. Why are you here?
- Why the fuck do you think I'm here?

53:18.172 --> 53:20.182
Shit.

54:25.498 --> 54:27.708
I'll leave you two alone.

54:29.258 --> 54:32.339
Lilly, I'm sorry about before.

54:35.299 --> 54:37.389
She's amazing.

54:40.179 --> 54:42.180
Lillian,

54:42.270 --> 54:44.980
could...

54:45.020 --> 54:49.030
could you have Henry
re-scan the animals for me?

54:49.110 --> 54:51.361
- OK.
- Thanks.

54:54.321 --> 54:56.321
- Hey.
- Hey.

54:58.161 --> 55:02.292
I brought your manuscript
in case you want to work.

55:07.712 --> 55:09.842
How are you feeling?

55:09.922 --> 55:11.632
Good.

55:15.933 --> 55:17.933
I'm sorry.

55:21.063 --> 55:23.104
What about?

55:30.984 --> 55:33.155
There's been progress at work.

55:35.325 --> 55:39.415
My conquistador.
Always conquering.

55:39.495 --> 55:44.046
- No. Something amazing. We tested...
- That's for you.

55:44.966 --> 55:47.676
It's for me? What is it?

55:47.756 --> 55:49.796
Open it.

56:11.158 --> 56:13.738
Pen and ink. For writing.

56:21.879 --> 56:25.339
It's all done except the last chapter.

56:27.260 --> 56:29.260
I want you to help me.

56:30.390 --> 56:32.560
How?

56:32.640 --> 56:34.850
Finish it.

56:37.641 --> 56:39.521
Finish it.

56:39.601 --> 56:42.321
- I don't know how it ends.
- You do.

56:43.231 --> 56:45.531
You will.

56:45.611 --> 56:47.612
Stop.

56:53.282 --> 56:56.702
- Remember Moses Morales?
- Who?

56:58.213 --> 57:01.583
- The Mayan guide I told you about.
- From your trip?

57:02.843 --> 57:07.013
The last night I was with him,
he told me about his father who had died.

57:07.093 --> 57:09.134
- But Moses wouldn't believe it.
- Izzi!

57:09.224 --> 57:12.764
No, no. Listen. Listen.

57:12.854 --> 57:16.474
He said if they dug his father's body up,

57:17.734 --> 57:19.735
he would be gone.

57:21.025 --> 57:24.275
They'd planted a seed over his grave.

57:24.365 --> 57:26.365
The seed became a tree.

57:27.945 --> 57:32.206
Moses said his father became part of that tree.

57:32.286 --> 57:36.626
He grew into the wood, into the bloom.

57:39.547 --> 57:42.927
And when a sparrow ate the tree's fruit,

57:43.797 --> 57:46.427
his father flew with the birds.

57:48.347 --> 57:50.348
He said

57:52.558 --> 57:55.438
death was his father's road to awe.

57:58.108 --> 58:00.188
That's what he called it.

58:01.399 --> 58:03.359
The road to awe.

58:05.279 --> 58:07.659
Now,

58:07.739 --> 58:12.290
I've been trying to write the last chapter and
I haven't been able to get that out of my head.

58:12.370 --> 58:14.750
Why are you telling me this?

58:15.670 --> 58:18.300
I'm not afraid any more, Tommy.

58:29.851 --> 58:34.652
I asked Lilly if I could be buried at her farm.

58:34.732 --> 58:37.152
No, stop it!

58:39.482 --> 58:43.743
- I want you to be with me.
- I am with you. Look.

58:44.953 --> 58:47.243
I'll always be with you.

58:49.833 --> 58:51.453
I promise.

58:56.464 --> 58:59.464
Will you stay with me tonight?

59:01.264 --> 59:03.674
Yeah. I'll stay.

59:11.435 --> 59:13.435
I'll stay.

01:00:03.370 --> 01:00:05.080
Don't worry,

01:00:05.870 --> 01:00:07.871
we're almost there.

01:00:12.381 --> 01:00:15.841
Through that last dark cloud is a dying star.

01:00:19.472 --> 01:00:22.682
And soon enough, Xibalba will die.

01:00:24.352 --> 01:00:27.602
And when it explodes,
you will be reborn.

01:00:29.983 --> 01:00:31.983
You will bloom.

01:00:38.283 --> 01:00:40.364
And I will live.

01:01:10.697 --> 01:01:13.487
Don't worry.
We're almost there.

01:04:03.173 --> 01:04:06.923
Thank you, Lord! We are here!

01:04:09.844 --> 01:04:11.854
Circles.

01:04:13.064 --> 01:04:15.224
He leads us in circles.

01:04:17.024 --> 01:04:20.485
Only we are left.
All of your countrymen are dead.

01:04:20.565 --> 01:04:24.405
He killed them all with this blind quest.

01:04:27.405 --> 01:04:30.415
It's time. Time to stop him.

01:04:51.807 --> 01:04:54.858
Captain, we are lost.

01:04:54.938 --> 01:04:58.858
The Franciscan and his tales are false.

01:04:58.938 --> 01:05:01.198
There is no hope for us here.

01:05:02.779 --> 01:05:04.779
There's only death.

01:05:05.739 --> 01:05:10.249
- I've mapped us a course back to the ships.
- Coward.

01:05:11.039 --> 01:05:12.919
Damn the maps!

01:05:17.710 --> 01:05:20.170
We're close and I will find it.

01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:23.340
Captain! Captain! Captain!

01:05:23.430 --> 01:05:26.311
Father. What is it, Franciscan?

01:05:27.261 --> 01:05:29.351
In the jungle...

01:05:29.431 --> 01:05:31.691
The marking on the hilt.

01:05:31.771 --> 01:05:35.822
- On the dagger?
- It is the same. The same as on the stone.

01:05:56.294 --> 01:06:00.924
Your choice - die now
or, by my side, fight and live.

01:06:12.855 --> 01:06:16.486
- You fool.
- Captain!

01:06:16.566 --> 01:06:18.656
Father.

01:06:18.736 --> 01:06:21.036
Take it.

01:06:21.116 --> 01:06:22.866
We are here.

01:06:22.956 --> 01:06:25.246
- Where?
- The temple is there.

01:06:31.207 --> 01:06:33.127
Sorry, Father.

01:06:34.337 --> 01:06:36.927
For you, there is only death.

01:06:38.298 --> 01:06:41.218
But our destiny is life.

01:07:07.630 --> 01:07:10.921
You shall wear it when you find Eden,

01:07:11.001 --> 01:07:15.471
and when you return,
I shall be your Eve.

01:07:25.812 --> 01:07:27.902
Iz! Iz!

01:07:33.943 --> 01:07:36.113
Come on, come on, come on!

01:07:36.203 --> 01:07:38.413
Oh, no. Please! Please!

01:07:41.084 --> 01:07:43.584
- Step aside.
- She's in V-fib. Pulse thready.

01:07:43.664 --> 01:07:45.794
- I'm bagging. Sir! Sir!
- Izzi! Izzi!

01:07:45.874 --> 01:07:48.794
- Get the family out. Get him out!
- Sir, please!

01:07:48.874 --> 01:07:50.254
- Pads.
- Charging.

01:07:50.334 --> 01:07:51.345
- Pulse?
- Thready.

01:07:51.425 --> 01:07:52.675
Pressure?

01:07:56.925 --> 01:07:58.935
Oh, God.

01:08:20.287 --> 01:08:21.997
Tommy.

01:08:23.877 --> 01:08:26.008
I know. I know.

01:08:26.087 --> 01:08:28.837
I've never seen anything like it.

01:08:28.917 --> 01:08:31.258
- Antonio didn't reach you?
- What?

01:08:31.337 --> 01:08:34.679
It's Donovan.
The growth is shrinking.

01:08:34.759 --> 01:08:37.269
It's like the disease is cured.

01:08:39.939 --> 01:08:42.229
Izzi.

01:08:42.309 --> 01:08:44.319
Izzi!

01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:49.529
Izzi!

01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:55.741
- No, no, no, no!
- Sir. Please, sir.

01:08:55.831 --> 01:08:57.081
Sir!

01:08:57.161 --> 01:09:01.121
Sir, it's too late.
I'm going to have to ask you to leave.

01:09:01.211 --> 01:09:03.961
- Sir, it's too late.
- You killed my wife!

01:09:04.041 --> 01:09:06.881
- Get off him! Let go!
- Let go!

01:09:40.205 --> 01:09:41.625
No.

01:09:43.425 --> 01:09:44.585
No.

01:09:44.675 --> 01:09:46.005
No!

01:09:46.095 --> 01:09:48.466
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

01:09:48.555 --> 01:09:51.265
Don't die! Don't die!
Don't die! Don't die!

01:09:51.305 --> 01:09:53.185
No! No!

01:09:53.265 --> 01:09:55.306
No!

01:10:24.259 --> 01:10:30.890
It seems to me that we struggle
all our lives to become whole.

01:10:33.770 --> 01:10:36.310
Complete enough when we die

01:10:38.310 --> 01:10:40.821
to achieve a measure of grace.

01:10:43.691 --> 01:10:45.651
Few of us ever do.

01:10:47.491 --> 01:10:53.412
Most of us end up going out
the way we came in, kicking and screaming.

01:10:57.672 --> 01:11:02.423
But somehow Izzi, young as she was,

01:11:04.133 --> 01:11:06.843
she achieved that grace.

01:11:06.883 --> 01:11:10.053
In her last days she became whole.

01:11:10.853 --> 01:11:12.934
She saw her...

01:11:14.144 --> 01:11:15.774
Tommy!

01:11:19.444 --> 01:11:22.024
- Tommy...
- Just stop it!

01:11:28.285 --> 01:11:32.205
Death is a disease.
It's like any other.

01:11:32.285 --> 01:11:35.006
And there's a cure.

01:11:35.086 --> 01:11:36.376
A cure.

01:11:36.466 --> 01:11:39.086
And I will find it.

01:11:53.357 --> 01:11:54.648
No!

01:14:28.732 --> 01:14:30.732
All these years.

01:14:32.323 --> 01:14:34.743
All these memories.

01:14:37.453 --> 01:14:39.493
There's been you.

01:14:50.294 --> 01:14:51.344
You...

01:14:51.424 --> 01:14:53.805
You pulled me through time.

01:15:05.646 --> 01:15:07.356
Dr Creo?

01:15:24.667 --> 01:15:26.758
Dr Creo, we heard you were back.

01:15:27.838 --> 01:15:33.258
Update me on everything we know
about that tree. Every detail.

01:15:43.689 --> 01:15:46.280
I'm OK. Everything's fine.

01:15:48.860 --> 01:15:52.660
The Donovan breakthrough's
our starting point. It's a starting point.

01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:54.990
Right, let's build on it.

01:15:55.080 --> 01:15:57.501
Stop ageing, stop dying.

01:15:57.581 --> 01:15:59.831
Stop dying, that's our goal.

01:15:59.921 --> 01:16:03.591
Scans. Cultures. Charts.
Let's get to work.

01:16:09.932 --> 01:16:12.342
Come on, let's get to work.

01:16:40.255 --> 01:16:42.255
Xibalba.

01:16:51.556 --> 01:16:54.306
We're here.

01:17:20.008 --> 01:17:22.009
We almost made it.

01:17:26.969 --> 01:17:28.969
I'm sorry.

01:17:30.349 --> 01:17:32.270
I'm sorry.

01:17:32.350 --> 01:17:35.150
Finish it.

01:17:38.110 --> 01:17:41.280
Stop it. Stop it!

01:17:43.111 --> 01:17:45.321
What do you want?

01:17:46.911 --> 01:17:48.911
Leave me! Leave me alone!

01:17:50.911 --> 01:17:54.082
Please, please. I'm afraid.

01:18:38.466 --> 01:18:41.426
Will you deliver Spain from bondage?

01:18:44.386 --> 01:18:46.307
I don't know.

01:18:46.387 --> 01:18:48.687
I'm trying. I don't know how.

01:18:48.767 --> 01:18:50.857
You do.

01:18:52.067 --> 01:18:54.107
You will.

01:18:56.398 --> 01:18:58.408
You do.

01:19:01.278 --> 01:19:03.118
You will.

01:19:13.249 --> 01:19:16.719
I'm not afraid any more, Tommy.

01:19:21.300 --> 01:19:23.430
I'm gonna die.

01:19:28.351 --> 01:19:30.651
I'm going to die.

01:19:30.731 --> 01:19:33.861
Together we will live forever.

01:19:35.361 --> 01:19:37.361
Forever.

01:19:37.451 --> 01:19:39.612
Forever.

01:19:59.844 --> 01:20:01.844
Forever.

01:20:11.355 --> 01:20:13.905
We will live forever.

01:20:21.116 --> 01:20:23.536
Finish it.

01:20:25.286 --> 01:20:27.336
OK.

01:20:30.046 --> 01:20:32.257
- What are you doing here?
- Take a walk with me.

01:20:32.337 --> 01:20:35.257
- I have to work.
- It's the first snow. We always...

01:20:35.347 --> 01:20:37.967
They're waiting on me.

01:20:38.057 --> 01:20:41.137
- Come on, Tommy.
- Please, Izzi.

01:20:42.438 --> 01:20:45.438
I'm sorry. I am.

01:20:46.768 --> 01:20:48.858
I'll see you tonight, OK?

01:20:55.029 --> 01:20:56.279
Izzi.

01:20:56.369 --> 01:20:59.199
Hey! Dr Creo.
Antonio's on his way back.

01:20:59.999 --> 01:21:04.080
Donovan's open and ready.
His vitals are steady.

01:21:05.670 --> 01:21:08.090
Come on. Let's go.

01:21:11.130 --> 01:21:13.341
Dr Creo, where are you going?

01:21:15.051 --> 01:21:17.011
Izzi!

01:21:17.181 --> 01:21:18.221
Izzi.

01:22:28.888 --> 01:22:30.888
No!

01:22:37.188 --> 01:22:39.809
Finish it.

01:23:43.425 --> 01:23:45.215
Behold.

01:26:08.288 --> 01:26:10.379
My queen.

01:26:11.499 --> 01:26:13.509
Now and forever.

01:26:14.509 --> 01:26:16.339
We shall be together.

01:29:35.058 --> 01:29:37.058
Bye, Iz.

01:29:50.950 --> 01:29:52.450
I finished it.

01:29:52.540 --> 01:29:55.040
Is everything all right?

01:29:55.120 --> 01:29:57.250
Yes.
