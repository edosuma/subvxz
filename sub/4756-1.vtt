We're gonna have some fun.

Fun? We're not here
to have fun, Ruben.
We're here to win.

03:12.333 --> 03:14.667
Do you think East
Coast is here to have fun?
Hell, no! So, no fun.

03:14.667 --> 03:18.291
Okay. I won't use
the "F" word anymore.

03:18.291 --> 03:21.375
Look, this year
we're taking the title
and going on the world tour.

03:21.375 --> 03:25.000

Let's bust some

REPORTER: Cheer TV is live
at the Hard Rock Hotel
at Universal Orlando.

03:43.750 --> 03:46.458
And I'm here
with Pepper Driscoll
and Vance Voorhees,

03:46.458 --> 03:48.875
owners of the two
rival cheer camps.

03:48.875 --> 03:50.875
Pepper, can you tell
us a little bit about

03:50.875 --> 03:52.709
the All Star Cheer
Camp Championships?

03:52.709 --> 03:56.041
I'd love to. Well,
this year is extra special,

03:56.041 --> 03:58.709
because the winning squad
will represent
our great nation

03:58.709 --> 04:02.166
on a Cheer
Exhibition World Tour.
That's right.

04:02.166 --> 04:05.041
And my teams will come in
at least first and
second place again.

04:06.291 --> 04:08.542
Pepper's camp has
both champion squads

04:08.542 --> 04:12.083
that epitomize the clash
in American cheer styles.

04:12.083 --> 04:14.083
In fact,
last year, one of her squads,

04:14.083 --> 04:17.166
the East Coast Jets,
with their
traditional cheer moves

04:17.166 --> 04:19.583
narrowly defeated
the West Coast Sharks,

04:19.583 --> 04:21.583
another one of
Pepper's squads shown here

04:21.583 --> 04:23.458
with their new
wave dance styling

04:23.458 --> 04:26.417
inspired by music
video choreography.

04:26.417 --> 04:28.667
In the cheer world,
the controversy
is brewing over

04:28.667 --> 04:33.000
what exactly
defines cheerleading,
precision or flavor.

04:33.000 --> 04:34.750
Speaking of controversy,
Vance,

04:34.750 --> 04:36.583
is the bad blood
between your Camp Victory

04:36.583 --> 04:38.709
and Pepper's
Camp Spirit Thunder

04:38.709 --> 04:41.166
related to your divorce?

04:41.166 --> 04:42.834
Of course not.
We're both professionals,

04:42.834 --> 04:44.542
and we handle our
craft seriously.

04:44.542 --> 04:45.959
Which is why I can
say that, this year,

04:45.959 --> 04:48.500
a Camp Victory team
will vanquish all comers.

04:48.500 --> 04:50.750
By vanquish he
means third again.

04:50.750 --> 04:53.625
No, this year
Camp Victory has
a secret weapon.

04:53.625 --> 04:55.792
Bulltwinkle, you do not.

04:55.792 --> 04:58.000
We do, and I guess
you're gonna have
to wait and see.

04:58.000 --> 05:01.709
Well, we'll all see
in this Saturday's
World Cheer Exhibition

05:01.709 --> 05:03.792
right here on Cheer TV.

05:26.000 --> 05:27.625
All right,
after everybody unpacks,

05:27.625 --> 05:28.959
we need to
practice our home routine.

05:28.959 --> 05:30.166
We just got here.

05:30.166 --> 05:31.792
Yeah, and if we want
to leave here winners,

05:31.792 --> 05:33.917
it's going to take practice,
practice
and more practice.

05:33.917 --> 05:35.291
And after that...

05:35.291 --> 05:36.458
Oh, my God. Carson.

05:36.458 --> 05:38.125
I'm, like, so glad
you came back this year.

05:38.125 --> 05:40.917
Hey, Brooke,
of course we came back.

05:40.917 --> 05:44.667
After losing to us
three years in a row,
it's, like, so brave.

05:44.667 --> 05:46.834
Yo! Can we burn
this Least Coast trash?

05:46.834 --> 05:49.166
You know what?
They're not even
worth it, Aeysha.

05:49.166 --> 05:51.542
Give it up, Brooke.
We're not gonna
play like that.

05:51.542 --> 05:54.500
Oh, you mean like champions?

05:54.500 --> 05:56.750
Yeah.
Not really your thing, huh?

05:56.750 --> 05:58.834

gonna find gorillas?

06:16.542 --> 06:17.875
Just follow my lead.

06:17.875 --> 06:20.333

little purse dog of yours

06:42.750 --> 06:44.583
ever pull that skanky
East Coast mess again,

06:44.583 --> 06:46.750
I will slice you
like government cheese!

06:46.750 --> 06:48.417
Aeysha, give it a rest.
Give it a rest.

06:48.417 --> 06:50.041
I swear to you I will...

06:50.041 --> 06:51.917
I didn't know
the government made cheese.

06:51.917 --> 06:53.750
She better watch her back.

06:55.083 --> 06:56.166
What?

06:56.166 --> 06:58.583
You go, girl.

06:58.583 --> 07:00.875
You know what?
I need to rework
that transition, anyway,

07:00.875 --> 07:03.458
so free time until
opening ceremonies.

07:31.250 --> 07:32.750
(EXCLAIMS)

07:34.125 --> 07:35.333
Whoa.

07:37.458 --> 07:39.208
Hey, are you okay?

07:39.208 --> 07:40.625
I'm fine.

07:40.625 --> 07:43.125
You kind of got skid marks.

07:43.125 --> 07:46.750
Good.
Now the police can
track down the stroller.

07:46.750 --> 07:48.792
Hey, why do I feel
like I've met you before?

07:48.792 --> 07:50.709
I don't know.
Maybe in a prior life.

07:50.709 --> 07:54.709
Well, I was thinking this one,
but now that sounds whack.

07:54.709 --> 07:56.166
So, where are you from?

07:56.166 --> 07:59.125
California. A place
called Eden Hills. You?

07:59.125 --> 08:02.625
Nowhere and everywhere.
You know, I'm an army brat.

08:02.625 --> 08:04.583
I guess I'm just
a regular brat.

08:04.583 --> 08:06.166
I've never been
out of the country.

08:06.166 --> 08:07.792
We just moved
back from London.

08:07.792 --> 08:10.291
Really?
We're going there soon.

08:10.291 --> 08:12.291
Oh, you're gonna love England.

08:12.291 --> 08:14.083
-You know me so well.
-Oh, no doubt.

08:14.083 --> 08:15.875
Because, you know,
in our prior life, when

08:15.875 --> 08:17.333
we were guards at
Buckingham Palace,

08:17.333 --> 08:19.333
you were that hottie wearing
that bearskin hat.

08:19.333 --> 08:21.834
Of course, all the guards
were trying to
hook up with you.

08:21.834 --> 08:24.750
Oh, right, let me guess.
You defended my honor.

08:24.750 --> 08:27.250
No, I was trying
to get at you, too.

08:27.250 --> 08:29.208

It's Carson.

09:00.375 --> 09:01.583
It's Penn.

09:08.041 --> 09:10.000
If you need help
wiping that off...

09:12.583 --> 09:15.166
Just so you know,
I'm not mad anymore.

09:15.166 --> 09:17.583
I MySpaced it all
out of my system.

09:17.583 --> 09:20.959
Now, hurry up,
or we're gonna be late
for the opening ceremony.

09:20.959 --> 09:23.875
Why him? Why now?

09:23.875 --> 09:25.208
Why who?

09:25.208 --> 09:27.291
Aeysha, I met this guy.

09:27.291 --> 09:30.041
What? I wasn't even sure
you remember what guys were.

09:30.041 --> 09:31.709
His name is
Penn and he's so...

09:31.709 --> 09:33.709
Carson, breathe.

09:33.709 --> 09:37.000
He's awesome and smart,
but in a good way.
And he's hot,  caliente
hot.

09:37.000 --> 09:39.542
Aeysha,
I want to lick his abs.

09:39.542 --> 09:40.834
But you didn't, right?

09:40.834 --> 09:42.250
No!

09:42.250 --> 09:46.166
I need to stay focused,
that means no cute boys.

09:46.166 --> 09:48.208
Right now,
beating the Jets
is my top priority.

09:48.208 --> 09:50.083
And you're doing
the right thing.

09:50.083 --> 09:51.125
I know.

09:51.125 --> 09:52.875
So, can I have him?

09:58.792 --> 10:00.125
Penn looks hot.

10:00.125 --> 10:01.125
Just don't.

10:05.667 --> 10:06.875
What do you mean?

10:06.875 --> 10:08.583
I like your hair
that way, Chelsea.

10:08.583 --> 10:10.250
Oh, it's this new gel.

10:10.250 --> 10:11.709
My hair always looks better
when there's
something sticky in it.

10:14.250 --> 10:15.500
All right. Who is she?

10:16.709 --> 10:18.083
What?

10:18.083 --> 10:19.750
The girl who's
making you stupid.

10:19.750 --> 10:21.583
All right.
Check it out. I met her today

10:21.583 --> 10:23.417
when I was running.
Her name's...

10:23.417 --> 10:24.542
-Carson!
-Carson!

10:24.542 --> 10:26.250
-Right.
-Wrong.

10:26.250 --> 10:28.542
She's a Shark.
She's the frigging
captain of the Sharks.

10:28.542 --> 10:30.041
And what did she say?
What did she want?

10:30.041 --> 10:31.291
Did she ask
about our routines?

10:31.291 --> 10:34.250
Yeah, right.
Cheering was the last
thing we talked about.

10:34.250 --> 10:38.333
Penn,
she's like your sworn emeny.
I swear it.

10:38.333 --> 10:40.500
Trust me. She's not my enemy.

10:48.125 --> 10:50.125
Penn, you need to know.

10:50.125 --> 10:52.834
Carson's a two-faced,
back-biting,
man-eating Shark!

10:52.834 --> 10:54.917
Yeah. And guys hate biters.

10:54.917 --> 10:56.125
Why are you
guys busting on me?

10:56.125 --> 10:57.250
Because you don't get it.

10:57.250 --> 11:00.125
Yeah. I think I do.

11:02.792 --> 11:07.625
Don't flatter yourself, Penn.
This is about our team,
about winning.

11:07.625 --> 11:09.000
So now what, Captain?

11:09.000 --> 11:10.667
Are you gonna forbid me
from seeing Carson?

11:10.667 --> 11:11.875
I would never do that.

11:11.875 --> 11:14.166
Good, 'cause it wouldn't work.

11:18.625 --> 11:19.667
(EXCLAIMS)

11:19.667 --> 11:21.875

11:21.875 --> 11:25.542
Duh, Chelsea. Watch and learn.

11:32.750 --> 11:36.000
Thank you.
Thank you. Thank you.

11:36.000 --> 11:39.291
Hi, everybody.
Welcome to Camp
Spirit Thunder.

we're so proud to welcome

11:45.625 --> 11:48.000
a new member to
our family, okay.

11:48.000 --> 11:49.667
I heard she's really tough.

11:49.667 --> 11:54.041
Give a big Spirit welcome
to our new choreographer,
Chicago.

11:54.041 --> 11:56.000
Come on up here, girl.

12:00.000 --> 12:01.041
(WHISTLES)

12:01.041 --> 12:03.291
All right, all eyes on me.

12:03.291 --> 12:05.792
Now,
I want you all to remember
this gorgeous face,

12:05.792 --> 12:08.250
'cause it will
haunt you in your sleep.

12:08.250 --> 12:10.875
Now, I believe in hard work.
Winning knows no pain.

12:10.875 --> 12:14.875
So, when I say jump,
I wanna hear, "How high?"

12:14.875 --> 12:16.208
Now jump.

12:16.208 --> 12:17.583
ALL: How high?

12:17.583 --> 12:20.792
That's what I'm talking about.
Don't hate the player, baby.

12:20.792 --> 12:24.834
Okay, seriously,
Cheerzilla is a little scary.

12:24.834 --> 12:27.375
What? I love her.

12:27.375 --> 12:30.709
She's the kind of black woman

She's amazing.

12:30.709 --> 12:36.750
Welcome your cheer-tastic 2008
Spirit Thunder instructors!

12:41.583 --> 12:43.291
Come on, guys.

12:49.083 --> 12:50.625
That was really great.

12:50.625 --> 12:52.125
(CONGA  PLAYING)

13:20.834 --> 13:23.792
Yeah! Aren't they terrific?

13:23.792 --> 13:26.000
Aren't they wonderful?

13:26.625 --> 13:28.375
Yeah!

13:29.041 --> 13:30.625
All right.

13:30.625 --> 13:36.166
And now, as you know,
we have a very
special tradition here

13:36.166 --> 13:39.250
at Camp Spirit Thunder.

13:42.083 --> 13:44.917
This spirit
stick was given to me

13:44.917 --> 13:47.542
by the father of
cheerleading himself,

13:47.542 --> 13:49.291
Herkie Herkimer.

13:49.291 --> 13:53.208
It embodies
the heart and the soul
of cheerleading,

13:53.208 --> 13:56.834
and it brings the luck
of the cheer spirits.

13:56.834 --> 14:00.291
So, each team will
be able to experience

14:00.291 --> 14:03.750
its powerful
aura for one night.

14:07.041 --> 14:08.750
That's right.

14:08.750 --> 14:13.208
And last year's winners of the
Championships will
have the honors first,

14:13.208 --> 14:15.125
the East Coast Jets.

14:20.041 --> 14:21.625
-Go get it.
-What?

14:21.625 --> 14:23.583
-Come on. You do it. Go.
-What?

14:23.583 --> 14:25.125
Just a warning.

14:25.125 --> 14:29.834
Lose the stick and
you will face the wrath
of the cheer gods.

14:29.834 --> 14:34.375
I once knew a cheerleader
who misplaced
the stick for just one day

14:34.375 --> 14:36.166
and she broke her leg doing
a simple toe touch.

14:36.166 --> 14:37.375
Wait for it.

14:37.375 --> 14:38.709
So guard it with
your lives, people.

14:38.709 --> 14:40.291
Wait for it.

14:40.291 --> 14:43.333
You will find good fortune
while it's in your possession,
Jets.

You know a cheer Crip

15:00.458 --> 15:02.333

with a cheer Blood.

15:03.917 --> 15:06.250

15:15.834 --> 15:17.291

15:17.291 --> 15:21.458
What, that I was
a male cheerleader? Sure.
That's a real panty-dropper!

you were a cheerleader.

And what's the big deal?
I'm a Jet. So what?

We'vegot a secret

Say, Pepper,
how many of
your kids can throw

15:51.583 --> 15:54.792

Everybody, it is all right.

16:08.792 --> 16:13.166
Vance Voorhees is just trying
to psyche us out. Okay?

16:13.166 --> 16:16.542
And it didn't work last year,
and it's not
gonna work this year.

Nothing's gonna
stop us this week.

knew Penn was a Jet

one thing on my mind,

to give me big facials.

a part of cheerleading,
anyway?

first started recognizing
that cheerleading was real.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.959
The blood of a virgin.

25:41.834 --> 25:43.291
Okay. Why are you
guys looking at me?

25:43.291 --> 25:46.417
Come on, Carson,
just a little pin prick.

25:46.417 --> 25:49.959
If she can take
a little prick,
she wouldn't be a virgin.

25:52.417 --> 25:53.500
RUBEN: You coming?

25:53.500 --> 25:54.792
Hell to the yeah.

25:54.792 --> 25:56.000
Where?

25:56.000 --> 26:00.000
You wouldn't be into it.
Cheer poker with
the Prairie Dogs.

26:00.000 --> 26:01.750
What's the buy-in?

26:01.750 --> 26:03.709
Sarah, this is cheer poker.

26:03.709 --> 26:05.875
Sounds like easy pickings.
Wait.

26:05.875 --> 26:07.875
Who's gonna guard
the spirit stick?

26:10.583 --> 26:15.458
You know what? You guys go.
I'm captain,
I'll do stick duty.

26:15.458 --> 26:16.750
-Thanks.
-Thanks, boo.

26:16.750 --> 26:18.083
SARAH:
What room is the poker game?

26:18.083 --> 26:20.000
RUBEN:
Dumpy Dogs have a suite.

26:53.041 --> 26:54.208
Why can't I delete you?

27:07.834 --> 27:09.542
Down here.

27:09.542 --> 27:10.500
Penn, what are you doing?

27:10.500 --> 27:12.166
Well, you don't
answer my calls and texts,

27:12.166 --> 27:15.792
so I had to do it old school
and show up in person.

27:15.792 --> 27:17.583
Don't make me serenade you.

27:17.583 --> 27:19.125
Penn, you're a Jet.
We can't...

27:19.125 --> 27:24.500
I know. I know. Look,
let's just do the rides.
No cheer talk. I promise.

27:24.500 --> 27:26.458
The Double-Dragon?

27:26.458 --> 27:28.041
Now you're talking.
I'll meet you.

27:29.041 --> 27:30.250
Cradle.

27:54.500 --> 27:56.000
That was sick!

27:56.542 --> 27:57.792
You had fun, didn't you?

27:57.792 --> 27:59.375
Hey! I know how to play, bro.

27:59.375 --> 28:00.917
Mmm-hmm.

28:00.917 --> 28:04.333
What?
I take cheering seriously.

28:04.333 --> 28:08.000
You know,
my team's counting on me.
I'm not gonna let them down.

28:08.000 --> 28:11.667
Word on the street?
It's just summer camp.

28:11.667 --> 28:15.458
Yeah, maybe for you.
We worked our butts
off just to get here.

28:16.250 --> 28:17.375
So did we.

28:17.375 --> 28:19.875
And we had to
raise a lot of money.

28:19.875 --> 28:23.333
You know,
wet T-shirt car washes.

28:23.333 --> 28:25.500
Trust me. I know.

28:25.500 --> 28:29.041
Anyways, winning
a competition like this,

28:29.041 --> 28:32.166
it could really up my chance
of getting
a scholarship to college.

28:32.166 --> 28:34.542
I even had to get
a team scholarship
just to get here.

28:34.542 --> 28:36.208
Yeah, so did I.

28:36.208 --> 28:38.792
You know, it's
nothing to be ashamed of.

28:38.792 --> 28:40.208
In my case, it is.

28:40.208 --> 28:41.333
What do you mean?

28:43.834 --> 28:46.959
Look, don't get all
serious on me, skids.

You are so bluffing,

29:03.875 --> 29:06.250

shoot down your cowboys?

Hey, what are you doing?
Oh, no, what the...

29:16.917 --> 29:19.000

overseas my whole life.

29:30.709 --> 29:34.250
Well, if you win again,
you can get
a cheer scholarship, too.

29:34.250 --> 29:35.792
To West Point?

29:36.792 --> 29:38.959
Okay,
wait, why would you go there?

29:41.083 --> 29:42.083
(SIGHS)

29:42.083 --> 29:45.834
Yeah, well, my father
is a son of immigrants,

29:45.834 --> 29:47.875
and they came from nothing.

29:47.875 --> 29:51.208
And after he made a career out
of the military,
he had everything.

29:51.208 --> 29:53.750
So, all his sons
went to West Point.

29:53.750 --> 29:57.291
There's five of us,
and, well, I'm the last one.

29:57.291 --> 30:00.959
So, my parents,
well, my father expects it.

30:00.959 --> 30:02.750
Well, can't you talk to him?

30:02.750 --> 30:05.750
I mean, won't he let you cheer
somewhere else?

30:07.250 --> 30:09.625
Wait. He doesn't know?

30:09.625 --> 30:11.875
My dad would spew a colon.

30:11.875 --> 30:15.166
I kind of told him
I joined the tae kwon do team.

30:16.959 --> 30:19.959
Can I tell you a secret,
but just between us?

30:19.959 --> 30:21.166
Sure.

30:30.750 --> 30:33.125
What?

30:33.125 --> 30:36.959
Even though my
family has money,
I took a team scholarship

30:36.959 --> 30:42.291
because I didn't want him
to find out about Cheer Camp.

30:42.291 --> 30:45.417
Wow.
Well, does your team know?

30:48.834 --> 30:50.291
Weak, huh?

30:51.917 --> 30:54.959
So, where does your
dad think you are now?

30:54.959 --> 30:57.166
Extreme Warrior

30:57.166 --> 30:59.166

pack my nunchuks.

you sharks do stick together.

31:23.959 --> 31:25.667
Yeah, get it, get it.

31:31.375 --> 31:33.458
Move it. Come on, honey.

31:41.458 --> 31:45.166
Oh, go get Carson.
Honey,
that girl can wear a thong.

31:45.166 --> 31:46.875
Yeah, my girl
needs to learn to hang.

31:46.875 --> 31:48.625
But we need to take
this show to my crib.

31:48.625 --> 31:50.792
She's guarding
the stick there.

31:50.792 --> 31:52.792
Come on, you all, let's go.
Let's go.

32:02.458 --> 32:04.792
Yo, Carson dipped out.

32:04.792 --> 32:06.333
And took the stick.

32:06.834 --> 32:09.041
Where?

32:09.041 --> 32:12.417
Maybe my girl learned to hang.
Come on, let's go find her.

32:17.125 --> 32:19.792
You know,
I should really get going.

32:19.792 --> 32:21.166
I just told you
my darkest secret.

32:21.166 --> 32:23.625
Yeah, I know, but...

32:23.625 --> 32:28.125
Look, when was the last time
you just danced for fun?

32:28.125 --> 32:31.166

thrown in the air
every few seconds?

32:32.083 --> 32:34.333
A bar mitzvah three years ago.

32:58.875 --> 33:01.750
So, Jet boy thinks
he can handle
West Coast moves?

33:01.750 --> 33:04.417
I think Shark girl's asking
the wrong question.

33:04.417 --> 33:06.333
(BE GOOD TO ME  PLAYING)

33:41.458 --> 33:44.166
No, Carson
wouldn't bring it here.
Too many haters.

33:44.166 --> 33:46.166
Where else can we look?

33:48.333 --> 33:50.333
I think I have an idea.

33:50.834 --> 33:52.458
Carson!

34:15.375 --> 34:16.542
Oh, no.

34:16.542 --> 34:17.458
What?

have a secret, too.

You need to check yourself.

34:25.875 --> 34:27.375
We were just hanging out.

34:27.375 --> 34:30.083
Carson, give us
back the spirit stick.

34:30.083 --> 34:32.875
You junk up its
karma around here
with all these civilians.

34:32.875 --> 34:34.041
Ruben, it's in our room.

34:34.041 --> 34:35.500

we're out here
looking for you?

how he got you
out of your room

35:04.500 --> 35:05.750
and then
the spirit stick was stolen.

35:05.750 --> 35:09.583
Seems wrong he didn't
tell you he was a Jet
when he met you.

35:09.583 --> 35:13.583

play us again, Carson.

I'll help you look
for the stupid stick,
all right?

35:20.417 --> 35:21.917
-What?
-Stupid stick?

35:21.917 --> 35:24.166
Yeah. I'll help you look, too.

35:25.083 --> 35:26.667
Look, don't get all
crazy about this, okay?

35:26.667 --> 35:28.250
No, it's not okay.

he didn't need you guys

35:33.208 --> 35:34.792
to raise travel
money for the trip.

35:34.792 --> 35:37.875
He was too
scared to tell his dad
about Cheer Camp.

35:37.875 --> 35:39.875
She's a liar, right, Penn?

35:42.959 --> 35:45.125
No, Brooke. I should
have just believed you

35:45.125 --> 35:48.625
when you said Sharks and Jets
were sworn enemies.

35:48.625 --> 35:50.583
Now I know why.

35:50.583 --> 35:53.000

didn't you?

some kind of
nasty stomach virus,

on the competition floor,
all right?

everyone was happy

home the next day,

get us cursed, freaks!

Yeah, except that
you don't deserve.

41:29.583 --> 41:32.458

the spirit stick to win.

41:32.458 --> 41:35.959

in a cheer-off, loser.

an all-time low for
Camp Spirit Thunder!

You've just ruined
this camp's chances
against Vance.

43:34.041 --> 43:35.667
And, even worse,

43:35.667 --> 43:37.125
you lost my spirit stick.

43:37.125 --> 43:39.542

back her spirit stick.

43:41.166 --> 43:43.000
why would my team
have gotten hurt?

started the rumble.

down yourselves,

steal the spirit stick.

given it back by now
to get rid of the curse.

still a sick individual.

Penn had nothing to
do with it, either.

we can't leave like this.

I don't think you stole
the spirit stick anymore.

any chance to stay

56:21.125 --> 56:24.792
Five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four,

56:24.792 --> 56:28.125
five, six, seven, eight.
One, two, three, four,

56:28.125 --> 56:29.792
five, six, seven, eight.

56:29.792 --> 56:30.792
-One, and two,
and three, and four...
-Hey!

56:30.792 --> 56:33.250
Ever heard of this new thing
called counting?

56:33.250 --> 56:35.166
Everybody stretch! Now!

56:35.166 --> 56:37.333
-Ever heard of team work?
-Shut up, Carson.

56:37.333 --> 56:38.458
Yo, watch it, cuz.

56:38.458 --> 56:40.041
Yo, stop fronting, cuz.

56:40.041 --> 56:43.208
I heard you with Chicago.
You're not just an Oreo,
Aeysha.

56:43.208 --> 56:44.291
You're double-stuffed.

56:44.291 --> 56:45.959
You're wrong, Brooke!

56:45.959 --> 56:48.875
My girl,
she been pulling drive-bys
since she was a shorty.

56:48.875 --> 56:50.208
Yo, she was drinking
40s off the nipple.

56:50.208 --> 56:51.583
Carson?

56:51.583 --> 56:53.709
So, don't be getting up
on her Kool-Aid, biatch,

56:53.709 --> 56:55.917
'cause I have
seen what she's done

56:55.917 --> 56:58.250
to fugly swamp donkeys
like you, fo shizzle.

56:59.208 --> 57:01.542
Carson, it's over.

57:01.542 --> 57:02.750
Are you sure?

57:02.750 --> 57:05.458
I cannot watch you
"fo shizzle" ever again.

57:07.208 --> 57:08.125
Good.

57:14.750 --> 57:18.667
Look, you all.
All this,
"Girl, please" and cursing,

57:18.667 --> 57:20.375
it ain't me.

57:20.375 --> 57:22.250
I mean, it isn't me.

57:22.250 --> 57:24.917
I just did it to
get your respect.

57:24.917 --> 57:26.750
See, the real Aeysha
got teased every day

57:26.750 --> 57:28.917
in junior high
for being an Oreo.

57:28.917 --> 57:32.583
You know,
black on the outside,
white on the inside.

57:32.583 --> 57:35.250
And I've been hood
ratting it up ever since.

57:35.250 --> 57:36.750
(EXCLAIMS)

57:36.750 --> 57:38.208
You're whiter than me.

57:38.208 --> 57:41.500
Maybe so,
but, that's who I am.

57:41.500 --> 57:44.000
Just a black
girl who enunciates.

57:46.375 --> 57:48.500
Do you have something to say?

57:48.500 --> 57:52.208
Hey, if you want
respect that badly,

57:52.208 --> 57:54.208
just be a bitch, like me.

57:55.625 --> 57:58.875
Same respect, half the effort.

57:58.875 --> 58:00.291
Guess the bitch
is out of the bag.

58:00.291 --> 58:02.000
Truth out!

58:04.959 --> 58:06.375
I'm a virgin.

58:10.458 --> 58:12.041
Technically.

58:12.041 --> 58:14.583
I just act that way
so guys will like me.

58:14.583 --> 58:17.000
But it's really hard
being slutty all the time.

58:17.000 --> 58:19.583
I don't know how
you do it, Brooke.

58:26.959 --> 58:30.750
My parents aren't bribing me
to be a cheerleader.

58:30.750 --> 58:34.000
I do it because
cheerleading is dark

58:34.000 --> 58:35.667
and twisted.

58:35.667 --> 58:37.417
Are you high?

58:37.417 --> 58:38.709
No. Think about it.

58:38.709 --> 58:40.291
We cheer for
the other team's failure

58:40.291 --> 58:44.208
just as much as we cheer
for own team's victory.

58:44.208 --> 58:45.917
That's so twisted.

58:45.917 --> 58:47.291
Sarah?

58:47.291 --> 58:49.792
Okay, I'm a little high.

58:49.792 --> 58:51.500
Yo, this is like confession.

58:53.333 --> 58:55.750
I'm out of here.

58:55.750 --> 58:56.917
No, wait.

58:59.542 --> 59:00.875
I have something to confess.

59:00.875 --> 59:02.333
BROOKE: This should be good.

59:02.333 --> 59:04.166
Miss USA has a secret.

59:04.166 --> 59:06.667
Spill, Tara Connor.

59:06.667 --> 59:08.417
I'm scared.

59:08.417 --> 59:09.750
It's okay, Carson.

59:09.750 --> 59:11.375
You can do it.

59:11.375 --> 59:13.875
No, that's it.

59:13.875 --> 59:15.166
I'm scared.

59:18.041 --> 59:20.792
You know, I act like
the fearless captain
who's not afraid to go for it,

59:20.792 --> 59:25.417
but, in reality,
going for it is
my biggest fear.

59:25.417 --> 59:27.750
I'm so confused.

59:27.750 --> 59:29.625
But don't let it stop you,
I mean,
it happens all the time.

59:29.625 --> 59:32.959
Yeah. What I meant was,

59:32.959 --> 59:35.291
I just wish I
could believe in myself

59:35.291 --> 59:37.458
as much as I
believe in all of you.

59:46.166 --> 59:47.583
I'm not gay.

59:49.542 --> 59:51.458
I like girls

59:51.458 --> 59:53.417
a lot.

59:53.417 --> 59:55.041
Are you serious?

59:56.333 --> 59:58.458
I'm straight.

59:58.458 --> 01:00:02.750
You girls just assumed,

01:00:02.750 --> 01:00:07.417
so once you started
changing in front of me,
I couldn't stop you.

01:00:07.417 --> 01:00:11.000
And then,
I was like committed.

01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.542
Hold up.

01:00:12.542 --> 01:00:16.041
There's no way
this guy's not gay,
and I'll prove it.

01:00:21.375 --> 01:00:22.709
Okay.

01:00:22.709 --> 01:00:24.375
He is not gay.

01:00:24.375 --> 01:00:26.792
No, but he is dead.

01:00:26.792 --> 01:00:28.291
-Get him.
-Get him.

01:00:30.417 --> 01:00:33.083
(ALL SHOUTING)

01:00:33.083 --> 01:00:36.125
Hey, Mom. Hey,
can I speak to the General?

01:00:37.500 --> 01:00:39.041
All right.

01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:42.959
Hello, sir.

01:00:42.959 --> 01:00:44.709
No, everything's fine.

01:00:44.709 --> 01:00:46.458
I'm fine.

01:00:46.458 --> 01:00:48.208
No, I'm great.

01:00:50.750 --> 01:00:54.208
Actually, I'm not at
Warrior Camp exactly.

01:00:54.208 --> 01:00:55.917
I'm at Cheer Camp.

01:00:58.291 --> 01:01:01.875
Because I'm a cheerleader.

01:01:03.625 --> 01:01:05.333
Yes, one of those.

01:01:08.917 --> 01:01:10.458
Sir?

01:01:10.458 --> 01:01:12.166
Dad?

01:01:12.166 --> 01:01:13.166
Dad!

01:01:13.166 --> 01:01:14.041
(SPEAKING SPANISH)

01:01:15.250 --> 01:01:16.917
Listen.

01:01:16.917 --> 01:01:18.667
This is the funny thing,
when you hear the rest,

01:01:18.667 --> 01:01:21.917
cheerleading is gonna sound
like the good part.

01:01:23.625 --> 01:01:25.041
About West Point...

01:01:26.166 --> 01:01:30.166
Okay, that was
traumatic but good, right?

01:01:30.166 --> 01:01:31.625
I mean,
now we can work as a team.

01:01:31.625 --> 01:01:33.917
Yeah. A team of freaks.

01:01:33.917 --> 01:01:36.333
We are not a team, okay?

01:01:36.333 --> 01:01:40.667
We can't combine routines
and this was a dumbass idea!

01:01:40.667 --> 01:01:43.125
Tell them, Ruben.
We can do this.

01:01:44.500 --> 01:01:46.834
We blow. We cannot do this.

01:01:46.834 --> 01:01:49.500
Because we're cursed,
all of us.

01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:52.375
Holy crap,
Ruben, snap out of it!

01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:56.458
What have you done
with happy Ruben?

01:01:56.458 --> 01:01:57.834
It's weird, you know.

01:01:57.834 --> 01:02:00.125
Now that I'm not gay anymore,

01:02:00.125 --> 01:02:01.792
I'm not gay anymore.

01:02:01.792 --> 01:02:05.208
Okay, we're freaks!
But let's make
that work for us.

01:02:05.208 --> 01:02:06.959
Come on, you guys.
I mean,
there has to be some way

01:02:06.959 --> 01:02:09.709
that we can perform together.

01:02:11.875 --> 01:02:13.792
We can start with couples.

01:02:13.792 --> 01:02:15.959
(BE GOOD TO ME  PLAYING)

01:02:34.583 --> 01:02:37.417
I'll take the lead.
So,
like, we're gonna copy them?

01:02:37.417 --> 01:02:38.917
I'm gonna move to
the right then to the left.

01:02:38.917 --> 01:02:40.625
Okay.

01:02:40.625 --> 01:02:41.709
Start up like that, all right?

01:02:41.709 --> 01:02:42.792
Okay.

01:02:42.792 --> 01:02:44.625
Here we go.

01:02:44.625 --> 01:02:45.750
Hey, you want to try this?

01:02:45.750 --> 01:02:46.625
There you go.

01:02:48.417 --> 01:02:49.667
Top again.

01:02:52.709 --> 01:02:55.166
All right, top again.
Here we go.

01:03:01.625 --> 01:03:04.208
Give me a turn. There you go.

01:03:33.500 --> 01:03:34.667
For real.

01:03:36.667 --> 01:03:38.291
This could work.

01:03:38.291 --> 01:03:40.709
And I'll prove it.
Get over here.

01:03:43.125 --> 01:03:45.792
All right, everybody ready?
From the top.

01:03:45.792 --> 01:03:48.583
Look,
I'm cool about you coming out
of the straight closet.

01:03:48.583 --> 01:03:50.625
Please,
you're just saying that
so I'll try to catch you.

01:03:50.625 --> 01:03:52.291
Try?

01:03:52.291 --> 01:03:55.208
All right.
Five, six, seven, eight.

01:04:49.667 --> 01:04:53.834
That was tight. You know what?
I think we could
actually win this.

01:04:56.041 --> 01:04:57.875
Maybe we should make sure.

01:04:57.875 --> 01:05:01.917
"Compare the opposing army
so you may know
where strength lies."

01:05:01.917 --> 01:05:03.208
Recon?

01:05:09.375 --> 01:05:11.375
Hey, guys. We need
to get some disguises.

01:05:18.667 --> 01:05:23.041
They practice on stage 70A.
Find it.
Cell phones ready?

01:05:23.041 --> 01:05:25.542
Recon positions by
texting only. Break!

01:05:41.542 --> 01:05:43.208
Chels,

01:05:43.208 --> 01:05:45.166
I'm right next to you.

01:06:01.834 --> 01:06:03.125
Thank you.

01:06:11.625 --> 01:06:13.542
VANCE: Hey,
Ron, get the gate for me.

01:06:15.375 --> 01:06:19.125
Hello, Mr. Voorhees.
The Flamingos just started...

01:06:19.125 --> 01:06:21.250
Listen,
we have got to tighten up
the security.

01:06:21.250 --> 01:06:23.417
I need more time
for my Flamingos...

01:06:23.959 --> 01:06:25.875
Keep up the good work.

01:06:28.458 --> 01:06:30.959
I guess your father
would laugh at us, huh?

01:06:30.959 --> 01:06:33.125
He's not big into laughter.

01:06:33.125 --> 01:06:35.959
You know,
I told him everything.

01:06:35.959 --> 01:06:37.250
Really?

01:06:37.250 --> 01:06:39.792
Then what'd he say
about you being a cheerleader?

01:06:39.792 --> 01:06:41.709
Well, that he laughed at.

01:06:44.291 --> 01:06:46.542
Hey, covert cheer-ops.

01:06:47.208 --> 01:06:49.041
Two-to-one pyramid.

01:06:51.834 --> 01:06:55.125
All right, Ruben, Eric, Nick,
you three in the corner,
be the base.

01:06:55.125 --> 01:06:58.083
Come on, guys, hurry up.
Let's go.

01:06:58.083 --> 01:06:59.500
Chelsea,
watch out for the guard.

01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:02.500
Brooke, first level.
All right.

01:07:02.500 --> 01:07:04.417
One, two, three.

01:07:05.917 --> 01:07:07.709
PENN: All right. Now, Carson.

01:07:07.709 --> 01:07:09.375
One, two, three.

01:07:16.542 --> 01:07:20.250
MAN: One, two, three, four,
five, six, seven, eight.

01:07:20.250 --> 01:07:22.583
I don't want to
see any loose knees.

01:07:22.583 --> 01:07:25.000
Jason, that's on the two.
You're always late.

01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.792
Wait,
how did you guys get in here?

01:07:26.792 --> 01:07:30.667
Seriously, that guy
wasn't even a real guard.

01:07:30.667 --> 01:07:33.333
"If an enemy
leaves the door open,
you must rush in."

01:07:33.333 --> 01:07:34.709
Art of War.

01:07:36.041 --> 01:07:37.542
MAN:
Base, keep it together now.

01:07:37.542 --> 01:07:40.792
I really want to see
you attack the ground.
Oh, yeah!

01:07:43.083 --> 01:07:44.709
BROOKE: Oh, my gosh.

01:07:44.709 --> 01:07:46.542
Welcome to cheer-topia.

01:07:46.542 --> 01:07:48.667
State of the art everything.

01:07:50.041 --> 01:07:51.709
Is that Letty Trotter?

01:07:51.709 --> 01:07:53.166
Choreographer to the stars?

01:07:53.166 --> 01:07:54.375
That look on your faces,

01:07:54.375 --> 01:07:56.709
that's the same look I
had after my divorce.

01:07:56.709 --> 01:07:58.542
So sad to see a dream die.

01:07:58.542 --> 01:08:00.250
(SIGHS)

01:08:00.250 --> 01:08:03.250
Anyhoo,
give my best to Pepper,
would you?

01:08:07.875 --> 01:08:10.250
Vance wasn't bluffing.

01:08:10.250 --> 01:08:12.417
Their tumbling is amazing.

01:08:12.417 --> 01:08:14.083
Those Flamingos are like...

01:08:14.083 --> 01:08:15.500
Better than us.

01:08:15.500 --> 01:08:17.667
We need to come up
with something really good.

01:08:17.667 --> 01:08:18.582
No, really?

01:08:18.582 --> 01:08:20.500
I thought we'd come
up with something bad

01:08:20.500 --> 01:08:22.125
and see if we
can win that way.

01:08:22.125 --> 01:08:25.166
Sorry, it's a reflex.

01:08:25.166 --> 01:08:26.709
What are we going to do?

01:08:26.709 --> 01:08:27.959
Look, I don't know, okay?
I can't believe it.

01:08:27.959 --> 01:08:32.000
After all this, I just wanted
to win Camp
Championships once.

01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000
Don't freak out, Carson.

01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.875
Yeah, easy for you to say.
You've won.

01:08:39.417 --> 01:08:42.542
Look, our dance routine
is better than theirs.

01:08:42.542 --> 01:08:45.082
We just need a triple threat.

01:08:45.082 --> 01:08:47.582
Let's think.
What would Sun Tzu do?

01:08:51.250 --> 01:08:54.625
"Make use of concubines
who are greedy for gold."

01:09:04.166 --> 01:09:06.542
I don't think Sun Tzu
would be riding
a rollercoaster, Carson.

01:09:06.542 --> 01:09:08.582
You see how the red
and blue rails loop?

01:09:08.582 --> 01:09:10.417
Criss-cross and
then corkscrew away?

01:09:10.417 --> 01:09:12.582
Yeah,
almost like a double helix.

01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:15.457
That'll be the path
of the two flyers.

01:09:15.457 --> 01:09:16.457
-Sweet!
-Sweet!

01:09:16.457 --> 01:09:18.375
No one's ever
done that before.

01:09:18.375 --> 01:09:20.291
We're gonna need something new
if we want to win.

01:09:20.291 --> 01:09:22.582
Imagine if we pull it off.
That would be sick!

01:09:22.582 --> 01:09:24.000
-It'd be awesome.
-So cool!

01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:26.500
But is it possible?

01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:29.332
Yeah, it's gonna
be really difficult
for the flyers.

01:09:29.332 --> 01:09:31.082

All right.
One portable hot press.

01:11:00.458 --> 01:11:02.542
Nice work.
Where'd you find that?

all over the world.

It doesn't really matter
what you call yourselves.

01:16:37.250 --> 01:16:41.166
Oh, and you call yourselves
the Flaming Hoes.

01:16:41.166 --> 01:16:42.959
Yeah. That's a bad choice.

now you gotta bring it.

As always,

deliver, huh? Let's hear you.

01:24:58.750 --> 01:25:00.792
We'll have to wait
for the judges to score

01:25:00.792 --> 01:25:02.667
because this one's
going to be close.

01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.667
-Too close.
-Yeah.

01:25:05.667 --> 01:25:07.667
Now is a really bad
time to be cursed.

01:25:08.750 --> 01:25:11.750
You know what?
Who cares if we're cursed?

01:25:11.750 --> 01:25:14.875
Getting cursed may have been
the best thing that's
ever happened to us.

01:25:14.875 --> 01:25:17.542
Without this curse,
we would have
never become this team,

01:25:17.542 --> 01:25:19.417
and hit a stunt
that's never been done before.

01:25:19.417 --> 01:25:22.041
I mean, that was amazing.

01:25:22.041 --> 01:25:24.709
I have the results right here.

01:25:24.709 --> 01:25:27.500

third place, apparently.

No, but you do.

stupid stick didn't
work in the first place.

-Pepper.
-Maybe it did.
