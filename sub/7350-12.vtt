WEBVTT

00:09.543 --> 00:12.780
WOMAN:
Human smuggling
is a federal offense, Julio.

00:12.813 --> 00:15.283
I am a fisherman.

00:15.316 --> 00:16.717
Oh, well that explains
why you dumped these guys

00:16.750 --> 00:18.352
in the water like
they were chum.

00:19.253 --> 00:20.554
We confiscated
your boat.

00:20.588 --> 00:22.123
It's really schmancy.

00:22.156 --> 00:24.392
Where'd you get a
boat like that, huh?

00:24.425 --> 00:26.394
No, I'd like to know--
who's your supplier?

00:26.427 --> 00:28.829
You got any
names for me?

00:28.862 --> 00:31.799
Tus cÃ³mplices en
los Estados Unidos.

00:31.832 --> 00:33.801
Nombres, por favor.

00:33.834 --> 00:37.171
Your Spanish
is incredible.

00:37.205 --> 00:39.073
Where did you learn?

00:39.107 --> 00:41.109
Miss Tawney's AP Spanish class,

00:41.142 --> 00:44.145
Chaminade Julienne High School,
Dayton, Ohio.

00:44.178 --> 00:45.179
MAN: All hands,
report to stations.

00:45.213 --> 00:47.115
Report to stations.

00:50.718 --> 00:52.220
What do you got,
Lieutenant?

00:52.253 --> 00:54.222
I got an unidentified vessel
off the starboard side

00:54.255 --> 00:55.789
refusing to respond.

00:57.491 --> 00:59.260
Boarding team,
prepare to intercept.

00:59.293 --> 01:00.461
You toss me
your jacket?

01:00.494 --> 01:01.429
All right.

01:01.462 --> 01:03.131
Thanks.

01:03.164 --> 01:04.198
Special Agent Borin,
what are you doing?

01:04.232 --> 01:06.267
I've been on this
boat two weeks,

01:06.300 --> 01:08.269
interrogating smugglers
and drug runners.

01:08.302 --> 01:10.271
A lot of chitchat
and little action.

01:10.304 --> 01:11.805
Girl's got to
have some fun.

01:30.158 --> 01:33.127
*

01:50.378 --> 01:52.413
U.S. Coast Guard,
hands where I can see them!

02:01.822 --> 02:04.292
Nothing fun about murder.

02:04.325 --> 02:06.794
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

02:06.827 --> 02:09.330
* Bang, bang, bang, bang

02:09.363 --> 02:12.166
* Boom, boom, boom, boom

02:12.200 --> 02:13.301
* How, how, how, how

02:13.334 --> 02:15.503
* Hey, hey

02:21.309 --> 02:22.810
* You gotta come on.

02:25.246 --> 02:26.480
Detective Simms?

02:26.514 --> 02:28.582
It's Chris Lasalle
from New Orleans.

02:28.616 --> 02:31.452
Yeah, we talked last week
about that individual.

02:31.485 --> 02:34.288
(man speaks indistinctly
over phone)

02:34.322 --> 02:36.324
Yeah, his name popped
at the Merrick hotel.

02:37.325 --> 02:38.826
Of course you know it.

02:38.859 --> 02:41.295
If you could check that out,
you'd be doing me a solid.

02:41.329 --> 02:42.930
Appreciate it.
Morning.

02:42.963 --> 02:44.265
You here all night?

02:44.298 --> 02:45.333
Yeah.

02:45.366 --> 02:47.435
Any luck?
Not sure, yet.

02:47.468 --> 02:48.936
You getting somewhere
on the search?
Maybe.

02:48.969 --> 02:51.205
If something pans out,
I'll let both of you know.

02:51.239 --> 02:51.939
Okay.

02:51.972 --> 02:53.941
Till then...

02:53.974 --> 02:57.278
CGIS has called in an assist.

02:57.311 --> 02:58.646
Coast Guard, huh?

02:58.679 --> 02:59.880
Does that mean...?

02:59.913 --> 03:02.550
It most certainly does.

03:05.253 --> 03:06.387
Pride,

03:06.420 --> 03:08.389
Lasalle, great
to see you again.

03:08.422 --> 03:10.324
Hey, Abigail.

03:10.358 --> 03:12.226
Great to see you, too.

03:12.260 --> 03:14.595
Well, Lasalle,
how you been, man?

03:14.628 --> 03:16.364
Agent Brody, CGIS
Hi.

03:16.397 --> 03:18.366
Special Agent Abigail Borin.

03:18.399 --> 03:20.468
We had the most fun I've ever
had on a joint-undercover op.

03:20.501 --> 03:24.605
Yeah, a bar, hotel room,
lot of sweaty hot bayou love.

03:24.638 --> 03:26.374
Sounds like fun.
BORIN: Not us.

03:26.407 --> 03:27.975
Not between us.
BORIN: Yeah, so...

03:28.008 --> 03:30.544
today, we found
a research vessel.

03:30.578 --> 03:32.380
Two dead grad students
on board, let's go.

03:32.413 --> 03:33.914
What's our angle?

03:33.947 --> 03:36.584
Well, supposed to be
a third person on board.

03:36.617 --> 03:39.320
The missing twenty-something
is Anna Huntley.

03:39.353 --> 03:42.490
She's the daughter
of Navy Admiral Adam Huntley.

03:42.523 --> 03:44.825
The admiral
been notified?
Yes.

03:44.858 --> 03:47.261
We told him that Anna
may have gone overboard.

03:47.295 --> 03:49.263
PRIDE: Search
and rescue?

03:49.297 --> 03:52.566
BORIN: Looking for her now,
running survival scenarios.

03:52.600 --> 03:54.568
Not a ton
of evidence so far,

03:54.602 --> 03:56.970
but we got this--
a paint transfer.

03:57.004 --> 03:59.973
Looks fresh, so it could
be from the killer's boat.

04:01.575 --> 04:04.812
We have two victims,
first is Mark Post.

04:07.681 --> 04:09.683
Our second victim,
Cindy Rutberg.

04:10.751 --> 04:11.852
The theory is--

04:11.885 --> 04:13.654
robbery on the high seas.

04:13.687 --> 04:16.857
Pirates?
Nah, more like floating
home invaders.

04:16.890 --> 04:19.660
Only sign of Anna so far
is this broken computer

04:19.693 --> 04:21.495
with the initials A.H.

04:26.734 --> 04:28.736
Got something here.

04:34.074 --> 04:36.610
BRODY: Looks like a piece
of wet suit.

04:36.644 --> 04:38.679
Doesn't match either
of our victims.

04:38.712 --> 04:39.413
Could be Anna's.

04:39.447 --> 04:41.715
She struggles
with the thieves,

04:41.749 --> 04:44.752
maybe slips or
pushed overboard.

04:46.086 --> 04:48.055
It's unlikely she would
have been taken hostage

04:48.088 --> 04:50.057
if we have two victims.

04:50.090 --> 04:52.326
Maybe she jumped to get
away from the thieves.

04:52.360 --> 04:54.061
She's out there
treading water somewhere.

04:54.094 --> 04:57.531
Muscle fatigue
and hypothermia,

04:57.565 --> 04:59.066
worst-case scenario,
Anna could survive

04:59.099 --> 05:00.568
probably eight hours
in the Gulf.

05:00.601 --> 05:01.935
And the best?

05:01.969 --> 05:04.438
Well, she had a wet suit on.

05:04.472 --> 05:06.640
I've seen people
make it 24, 48 hours,

05:06.674 --> 05:09.042
but that's a lot
of time in the water.

05:09.076 --> 05:11.579
A lot of time to find her.

05:12.646 --> 05:15.349
One way or the other,

05:15.383 --> 05:16.850
we got to bring
her home.

05:30.631 --> 05:31.965
Talked to the
crew's advisor,

05:31.999 --> 05:33.467
got their bios.

05:33.501 --> 05:35.102
Our dead, Mark Post,

05:35.135 --> 05:37.037
28, from New York,

05:37.070 --> 05:39.039
a diver
and oceanographer.

05:39.072 --> 05:40.874
Cindy Rutberg,

05:40.908 --> 05:42.876
27, from Maine,

05:42.910 --> 05:44.111
dual major,
ecology and biology.

05:44.144 --> 05:46.046
And then there was our
admiral's daughter,

05:46.079 --> 05:49.517
Anna Huntley, 28,
biologist

05:49.550 --> 05:50.551
and mother of
toddler Jeremy.

05:50.584 --> 05:51.919
What were they doing at sea?

05:51.952 --> 05:53.921
Five-day tour,

05:53.954 --> 05:55.789
studying the effects
of climate change.

05:55.823 --> 05:57.458
Got the boat's
equipment list.

05:57.491 --> 05:59.460
Dive tanks, mini-ROV,

05:59.493 --> 06:01.795
sonar, GPS, even a zodiac--
all stolen.

06:01.829 --> 06:03.797
Should we maybe think
about the fact

06:03.831 --> 06:05.799
that Anna could be
in on this?

06:05.833 --> 06:07.435
Two dead bodies,
no sign of her anywhere.

06:07.468 --> 06:10.070
I got to tell you guys,
I am not into your fancy coffee.

06:10.103 --> 06:12.440
It took me a while to get used
to the chicory, too.

06:12.473 --> 06:13.874
Chicory?
Help yourself, Borin, we
got two-day-old waffles

06:13.907 --> 06:15.509
in there, too,
if you missed them.

06:15.543 --> 06:18.579
Oh, sounds delicious, but
just need better coffee.

06:18.612 --> 06:19.246
That's my cup.

06:19.279 --> 06:21.615
You're welcome.
Mm-hmm.

06:21.649 --> 06:23.417
Told Agent Borin she can work
out of the conference room.

06:23.451 --> 06:25.619
Run the search
for Anna Huntley from there.

06:25.653 --> 06:27.655
Uh, SAR-OPS came back
with an alpha drift.

06:27.688 --> 06:29.156
So I've been working
on locales

06:29.189 --> 06:31.425
where Anna may be
treading water.

06:31.459 --> 06:32.526
BRODY:
Looks like half the Gulf,

06:32.560 --> 06:34.662
all the way to the
Louisiana coastline.

06:34.695 --> 06:36.464
BORIN: Ten hours and counting
to find her.

06:36.497 --> 06:38.899
Pride, Admiral Huntley is
on his way in.

06:38.932 --> 06:39.900
Wants an update.

06:39.933 --> 06:41.101
No pressure.

06:43.637 --> 06:45.906
That other case,
the missing person,

06:45.939 --> 06:47.641
just got a positive I.D.

06:47.675 --> 06:48.776
BOTH:
Go.

06:48.809 --> 06:49.810
We got this.

06:49.843 --> 06:51.879
Thank you.

06:57.117 --> 06:59.520
Missing man was going by
the name of Rich Kimble.

06:59.553 --> 07:02.756
Guess he was a frequent flyer
at the squat you flagged.

07:02.790 --> 07:04.858
I pulled him before my guys
went in, did a sweep for drugs.

07:04.892 --> 07:07.094
MAN: I told you, idiots!
Didn't find
nothing on him.

07:07.127 --> 07:09.196
I appreciate
it, Simms.
Anytime.

07:09.229 --> 07:10.931
MAN: I was in the wrong place
at the wrong time!

07:10.964 --> 07:12.533
Third cell
on the left.
Appreciate it.

07:12.566 --> 07:14.735
MAN: Oh, that's fine,
you want to ignore me?

07:14.768 --> 07:17.004
I'll go to the press!

07:17.037 --> 07:18.706
Me and my friends here.

07:18.739 --> 07:21.742
We'll have a little
sit-down with Diane Sawyer.

07:21.775 --> 07:24.578
Tell her what a crappy con
you got going on here.

07:37.925 --> 07:39.727
How you doing,
baby brother?

07:39.760 --> 07:41.729
Hey, Cade.

07:41.762 --> 07:43.597
"Rich Kimble," really?

07:43.631 --> 07:45.766
As in Dr. Richard Kimble?

07:45.799 --> 07:47.901
All of a sudden, you're
the Fugitive now?

07:47.935 --> 07:49.903
Well, seemed
kind of fitting.

07:49.937 --> 07:51.605
I mean, I am being
chased and all.

07:51.639 --> 07:54.675
Yeah, I have searched every gas
station, residence, warehouse,

07:54.708 --> 07:57.578
farmhouse, henhouse, outhouse
and doghouse for you.

07:57.611 --> 08:00.013
So, uh, Mama know
you found me?

08:00.047 --> 08:02.115
I'll call her when we get
in the car, let's go.

08:02.149 --> 08:04.084
Where we going?

08:04.117 --> 08:04.818
New Orleans, home.

08:04.852 --> 08:07.020
No. No, no, no,
no, no, no.

08:07.054 --> 08:08.722
I do not think so.

08:10.791 --> 08:12.893
Cade, for five years,

08:12.926 --> 08:14.995
we've been wondering
if you were dead or alive.

08:15.028 --> 08:17.698
Hey, lookee here,
I'm alive.

08:21.101 --> 08:22.670
Let's go.
Hey!

08:22.703 --> 08:24.071
Look, you got
two options.

08:24.104 --> 08:25.673
Either you leave
with me or get thrown

08:25.706 --> 08:27.875
into the state-run
prison psych facility.

08:29.777 --> 08:32.045
So what'll it be?

08:37.585 --> 08:39.587
New Orleans is awful beautiful
this time of year.

08:41.922 --> 08:43.156
Open up!

08:44.925 --> 08:47.160
What's the latest
on the search for my daughter?

08:47.194 --> 08:49.863
We have our team out
in full force looking for her.

08:49.897 --> 08:51.899
What kind of pattern
you running?

08:51.932 --> 08:53.901
Parallel search,
S-shaped pattern, sir.

08:53.934 --> 08:55.703
But I got to be
honest with you,

08:55.736 --> 08:56.804
it's a very large area.

09:01.008 --> 09:02.242
ADMIRAL:
First, I get a call this morning

09:02.275 --> 09:03.944
from you guys
telling me that Anna is missing,

09:03.977 --> 09:06.780
and out of the blue,
I get a call from the babysitter

09:06.814 --> 09:08.816
saying that she hasn't
picked up Jeremy, yet.

09:10.017 --> 09:12.986
I can command an entire carrier,
no problem.

09:13.020 --> 09:15.255
But this, a toddler...

09:15.288 --> 09:17.290
I'm lost.

09:18.826 --> 09:20.828
I just don't
remember kids being

09:20.861 --> 09:22.996
this much work when
Anna was this age.

09:23.030 --> 09:24.965
But, then again,
I wasn't around much.

09:24.998 --> 09:25.999
You were busy
serving your country.

09:26.033 --> 09:28.669
Yeah, well, try telling
that to a kid, right?

09:28.702 --> 09:31.138
Come on, buddy, up we
go, one, two, three.

09:31.171 --> 09:32.806
There we are.

09:32.840 --> 09:35.342
I was there maybe
for holidays, graduations,

09:35.375 --> 09:38.879
her mother's funeral,
but that distance...

09:38.912 --> 09:42.816
that distance
created distance.

09:42.850 --> 09:46.186
We are doing everything
we can to find Anna, sir.

09:46.219 --> 09:48.756
You need any of my contacts,
any of my resources,

09:48.789 --> 09:50.090
you be sure
to reach out.
Yeah, we will.

09:54.227 --> 09:56.830
WADE:
The gun that killed Cindy

09:56.864 --> 09:58.365
was a nine-millimeter.

09:58.398 --> 10:00.033
She was shot
three times.

10:00.067 --> 10:01.835
Once in the heart,
which killed her.

10:01.869 --> 10:04.204
The other two bullet
wounds are here--

10:04.237 --> 10:07.040
one on the hand
and on her lower leg.

10:07.074 --> 10:09.076
A hand
and a leg?

10:09.109 --> 10:11.011
Seems random.

10:11.044 --> 10:12.312
Like the killer didn't
know what they were doing.

10:12.345 --> 10:15.082
And Mr. or Ms. Didn't Know
What They Were Doing

10:15.115 --> 10:17.050
left a clue.

10:17.084 --> 10:19.252
I found this

10:19.286 --> 10:21.254
in one of Cindy's
bullet wounds.

10:21.288 --> 10:22.890
It's a metal
of some sort.

10:22.923 --> 10:24.391
BRODY:
From the killer's gun?

10:24.424 --> 10:25.693
Could be.

10:25.726 --> 10:28.061
I'll have
Sebastian process.

10:28.095 --> 10:29.797
Hey, Sebastian.
Hey.

10:29.830 --> 10:31.064
One thing that's interesting

10:31.098 --> 10:33.934
is none of Mark's
bullet wounds killed him.

10:33.967 --> 10:35.703
He died
because of this:

10:35.736 --> 10:38.105
an indentation
on the head

10:38.138 --> 10:40.073
which is consistent
with the boat rail.

10:40.107 --> 10:43.243
I also found something
under the cuff of the wet suit.

10:45.078 --> 10:46.113
Take a look.

10:47.147 --> 10:48.882
What the hell are those?

10:48.916 --> 10:51.051
I'm still trying
to identify the species,

10:51.084 --> 10:53.053
but it's some sort of
benthic worm.

10:53.086 --> 10:55.122
Which, by the way,
if I ever have a band,

10:55.155 --> 10:56.690
will be the name
of said band.

10:56.724 --> 10:57.991
Well, when Sebastian

10:58.025 --> 10:59.960
figures out where
they came from,

10:59.993 --> 11:01.194
it could help
you determine

11:01.228 --> 11:02.996
where the victims
were diving.

11:03.030 --> 11:05.165
Which will help us narrow down
our search for Anna.

11:05.198 --> 11:06.800
Mm-hmm. And in the meantime,

11:06.834 --> 11:08.068
I ran the paint traces
through the Mass Spec.

11:08.101 --> 11:11.004
Got a hit on this.

11:11.038 --> 11:13.807
The visible white paint
matched some cheapo
lead-laden stuff,

11:13.841 --> 11:16.376
but inside it were traces
of Radiant Red.

11:16.409 --> 11:18.846
It's a particular formula

11:18.879 --> 11:20.180
that was created
for this.

11:20.213 --> 11:20.848
An Azimut Yacht Racer.

11:20.881 --> 11:22.149
Now why would you paint over

11:22.182 --> 11:23.784
a beautiful boat like that?

11:25.052 --> 11:26.754
PATTON:
A red Azimut

11:26.787 --> 11:28.321
was stolen five
months back

11:28.355 --> 11:30.190
from a yacht club
in Key West, Florida.

11:30.223 --> 11:32.392
Thieves snuck in, turned
the key and just left.

11:32.425 --> 11:34.194
Owners took this
before it was stolen.

11:34.227 --> 11:35.195
Thieves painted over it

11:35.228 --> 11:37.197
with cheap
white paint.
PRIDE:
Surveillance?

11:37.230 --> 11:38.265
Description
of thieves?

11:38.298 --> 11:41.068
Just a witness description
of our perps to go off of.

11:43.203 --> 11:44.872
PRIDE:
"Kind of an older Brad Pitt

11:44.905 --> 11:46.006
"mixed with
some younger

11:46.039 --> 11:48.175
"George Clooney.
Late 40's,

11:48.208 --> 11:49.743
"scar on his cheek,

11:49.777 --> 11:52.012
"beard and
a sexy tan.

11:52.045 --> 11:54.915
Seen fleeing with two
young women in bikinis."

11:54.948 --> 11:56.249
You're kidding me.

11:56.283 --> 11:58.251
What it says.

11:58.285 --> 12:00.754
I got enough for FaceMatch.

12:00.788 --> 12:02.089
Okay.

12:02.122 --> 12:03.223
Agent Borin...

12:03.256 --> 12:04.925
Patton Plame,

12:04.958 --> 12:07.260
master digital
forensic sketch artist.

12:07.294 --> 12:08.095
Heard you're also
a master hacker.

12:08.128 --> 12:10.130
Can't believe
everything you hear.

12:10.163 --> 12:13.133
How you like me now?

12:13.166 --> 12:15.102
You just
rendered an image

12:15.135 --> 12:17.304
of every divorced
rich man in the South.

12:20.507 --> 12:21.775
Think you can do better?

12:21.809 --> 12:23.276
No. No.

12:23.310 --> 12:25.312
But I do have an idea.
Brody...

12:33.020 --> 12:35.322
PRIDE:
How's Cade?

12:35.355 --> 12:37.357
He's a mess, King.

12:37.390 --> 12:39.126
Up or down?

12:39.159 --> 12:40.327
He was up.

12:40.360 --> 12:41.862
Angry, but up.

12:41.895 --> 12:43.864
Just means
the down's coming.

12:43.897 --> 12:46.266
Got a 48-hour psych hold at
Southern Louisiana Memorial.

12:46.299 --> 12:48.068
Doctor's gonna run tests,

12:48.101 --> 12:49.136
get him back
on track.

12:49.169 --> 12:50.270
After that?

12:50.303 --> 12:51.371
Honestly, I ain't got a clue.

12:52.405 --> 12:54.174
Distract me, King.

12:54.207 --> 12:55.308
What's going on here?

12:55.342 --> 12:57.077
Speed dating.

12:57.110 --> 12:58.912
Coast Guard style.

13:00.247 --> 13:03.050
Muy bonita.

13:03.083 --> 13:05.585
Here, why don't you focus
on the picture, Julio?

13:05.618 --> 13:07.587
Have you seen this man?

13:07.620 --> 13:10.390
BRODY:
Supplies high-end boat
stuff to jerks like you.

13:10.423 --> 13:12.259
Stole a schmancy boat,
has two girlfriends.

13:12.292 --> 13:14.561
We think he might
have information

13:14.594 --> 13:16.396
about a missing girl.

13:16.429 --> 13:19.566
I rub your backs

13:19.599 --> 13:22.402
and you rub mine.

13:23.270 --> 13:26.373
BORIN:
Come on, Julio, cough it up.

13:26.406 --> 13:30.177
His name is Clive...
something.

13:30.210 --> 13:32.279
He uses the women
to lure boats.

13:32.312 --> 13:33.914
Steals from them

13:33.947 --> 13:36.016
and sells to people like me.

13:36.049 --> 13:38.952
Where does Rico Suave
keep his boat?

13:41.288 --> 13:43.356
The Empire Marina.

13:45.025 --> 13:46.526
Keep the picture.

13:53.300 --> 13:54.401
There's Clive.

13:55.502 --> 13:57.304
Fastest BOLO in agency history.

13:57.337 --> 13:59.472
World's dumbest criminal, too.

13:59.506 --> 14:01.208
Let's go.

14:17.590 --> 14:19.326
NCIS.

14:19.359 --> 14:20.327
Hands in the air.

14:20.360 --> 14:21.394
Easy.

14:22.629 --> 14:24.397
Clive Roberts?

14:42.515 --> 14:44.351
What's your hurry?
Ow! Let go!

14:44.384 --> 14:46.019
LASALLE:
Get your ass up.

14:48.555 --> 14:49.990
What do we got?

14:50.023 --> 14:51.558
It's all here.

14:51.591 --> 14:53.060
Crew's wallets,

14:53.093 --> 14:55.328
Anna's backpack, and this.

14:55.362 --> 14:56.663
Same type of gun
that was used on the victims.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.336
You killed these two people

15:03.370 --> 15:05.372
and you threw her overboard.
Where is she?

15:05.405 --> 15:07.440
No. Those two were already dead

15:07.474 --> 15:09.476
when we stole that
stuff off their boat.

15:09.509 --> 15:11.311
Look again.
Look at her.

15:11.344 --> 15:13.346
I haven't seen her
in my life. Ever.

15:15.682 --> 15:18.318
Get them out of here.

15:18.351 --> 15:19.486
BORIN:
That's what they all say.

15:21.388 --> 15:22.455
What do you think?

15:22.489 --> 15:24.491
Looks good for it:

15:24.524 --> 15:26.059
all the stolen
equipment,

15:26.093 --> 15:28.528
possible murder weapon.

15:30.563 --> 15:32.099
Patton.
Hmm.

15:32.132 --> 15:34.134
Yeah?

15:35.702 --> 15:37.537
PATTON:
Pride, you know
how you always say,

15:37.570 --> 15:38.671
"Go, learn things"?

15:38.705 --> 15:40.540
Yeah.
Well, I've been going

15:40.573 --> 15:42.375
through surveillance
from the Empire dock,

15:42.409 --> 15:44.377
looking for Clive.
This was taken yesterday.

15:44.411 --> 15:46.679
I have an estimated
time of death from Dr. Wade.

15:46.713 --> 15:49.349
That, plus the area
where the boat was--

15:49.382 --> 15:51.384
there's no way
Clive had time

15:51.418 --> 15:52.285
to kill those people.

15:52.319 --> 15:53.653
PRIDE:
So Clive was
telling the truth.

15:53.686 --> 15:55.188
They didn't get there

15:55.222 --> 15:56.523
until after Mark
and Cindy were dead.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.325
PATTON:
Oh, but check this out.

15:58.358 --> 16:00.127
I finally got something
off of that video card

16:00.160 --> 16:01.194
from Anna's laptop.

16:01.228 --> 16:04.164
Date-stamped the same day
the boat went missing.

16:08.501 --> 16:09.402
WOMAN:
Stop!

16:10.770 --> 16:12.272
WOMAN:
Stop!

16:13.473 --> 16:16.209
WOMAN: No!

16:18.311 --> 16:20.213
WOMAN:
Oh, my God.
Oh, my God, he's dead.

16:20.247 --> 16:21.548
Wait, is that...?

16:21.581 --> 16:23.583
Yeah.

16:23.616 --> 16:24.651
Anna.

16:42.369 --> 16:44.237
I just got off
with Search and Rescue.

16:44.271 --> 16:45.405
Now, based on

16:45.438 --> 16:46.739
the coordinates
where Clive said
he robbed the boat,

16:46.773 --> 16:49.142
we've narrowed
the search area for Anna

16:49.176 --> 16:50.743
down to here.

16:50.777 --> 16:52.112
Does she have
a record of any kind?

16:52.145 --> 16:53.646
LASALLE:
No arrests,

16:53.680 --> 16:55.515
no history of violence,
and doesn't own a gun.

16:55.548 --> 16:57.084
We've got two dead bodies

16:57.117 --> 16:58.651
and a woman wielding a Beretta.

16:58.685 --> 17:00.253
My guess is,
from the look in her eyes,

17:00.287 --> 17:02.122
this is
personal.

17:02.155 --> 17:03.656
LASALLE:
Picture only tells
half the story, Brody.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.725
She could be protecting
herself from pirates

17:05.758 --> 17:07.760
or a sea monster,
for all we know.

17:07.794 --> 17:09.262
We need more intel
on those people who were

17:09.296 --> 17:11.531
on the boat with her.
How 'bout doubling back

17:11.564 --> 17:12.665
with the woman
who gave us their bios?

17:12.699 --> 17:13.833
Their advisor,

17:13.866 --> 17:15.802
Dr. Sandra Jones,
oceanographer,

17:15.835 --> 17:17.704
scholar and known
algae-hugger.

17:17.737 --> 17:18.805
Borin,

17:18.838 --> 17:20.107
you're with me.

17:20.140 --> 17:21.708
Lasalle, Brody--

17:21.741 --> 17:23.510
stay here and keep digging.

17:25.712 --> 17:27.814
Is there any news on Anna?

17:27.847 --> 17:29.316
We're still looking for her.

17:29.349 --> 17:31.118
But given the
amount of time

17:31.151 --> 17:33.286
she's been in the Gulf,
we may now be looking

17:33.320 --> 17:34.821
at a recovery,

17:34.854 --> 17:36.356
rather than a rescue.

17:38.325 --> 17:40.793
I hope not, for her son's sake.

17:40.827 --> 17:42.495
You knew Anna well?

17:42.529 --> 17:44.697
She was one of my best students.

17:44.731 --> 17:46.833
Strong work ethic.
Single mother

17:46.866 --> 17:48.568
balancing school and a child.

17:48.601 --> 17:49.836
It was difficult for her,

17:49.869 --> 17:51.838
but she was very dedicated.

17:51.871 --> 17:54.874
Did Anna have any problems

17:54.907 --> 17:56.876
with anyone?

17:56.909 --> 17:58.711
Do you know if
she owned a gun?

17:58.745 --> 18:01.148
Did she ever seem impatient,
or angry, or...?

18:01.181 --> 18:02.882
Whoa, you-you don't
think that she...

18:02.915 --> 18:04.617
PRIDE:
We're just

18:04.651 --> 18:06.253
gathering information.

18:07.254 --> 18:08.855
If Anna had a gun,

18:08.888 --> 18:11.258
or a temper,
I didn't know of it.

18:11.291 --> 18:14.227
What about her relationship
with Mark and Cindy?

18:14.261 --> 18:15.895
What was that like?

18:15.928 --> 18:17.797
Look, you have

18:17.830 --> 18:19.466
to understand that
the three of them

18:19.499 --> 18:22.235
spent a lot of time
together on that boat.

18:22.269 --> 18:23.803
I mean, doing very
important work.

18:23.836 --> 18:24.871
Climate change
affects all of us.

18:24.904 --> 18:26.906
We just chose to ignore it...

18:26.939 --> 18:28.808
I'm sorry, Professor Jones,
you were talking about the crew?

18:28.841 --> 18:31.311
Yes. Um... yeah.

18:31.344 --> 18:33.746
Um, a few months ago,

18:33.780 --> 18:36.316
I saw Mark and Cindy at dinner.

18:37.950 --> 18:39.752
Friends can have dinner.

18:39.786 --> 18:42.289
Friends don't kiss other friends
on the lips.

18:42.322 --> 18:44.257
Well, sometimes,
after a few drinks...

18:44.291 --> 18:47.160
What? I'm saying
it happens.

18:47.194 --> 18:48.361
Needless to say,

18:48.395 --> 18:49.529
I was surprised

18:49.562 --> 18:50.897
to see Mark with Cindy.

18:50.930 --> 18:52.499
Why's that?

18:52.532 --> 18:54.267
Well, I thought Anna
and Mark were together.

18:54.301 --> 18:55.902
I mean, he even
wrote her a check

18:55.935 --> 18:57.704
when she got behind
on her college tuition.

18:57.737 --> 18:59.772
Friends with benefits.

19:01.274 --> 19:03.276
PATTON:
I went through Anna's e-mails.

19:03.310 --> 19:05.912
Tidal charts
and salinity reports.

19:05.945 --> 19:07.514
Just all science stuff.

19:07.547 --> 19:08.915
Nothing to back up
a jealous lover theory.

19:08.948 --> 19:10.350
BRODY:
Got something.

19:10.383 --> 19:12.552
Looks like she racked up
some IOUs.

19:12.585 --> 19:14.621
$80,000 in student loans

19:14.654 --> 19:17.857
and another ten grand
in credit card debts.

19:17.890 --> 19:19.226
PRIDE:
So if Anna's our killer,
that would mean

19:19.259 --> 19:20.927
she decided to stick up

19:20.960 --> 19:23.396
a couple of fellow grad students

19:23.430 --> 19:24.597
out in the middle
of the ocean?

19:24.631 --> 19:25.932
Something
doesn't fit.

19:25.965 --> 19:27.200
Well, if I could
just put together

19:27.234 --> 19:28.868
more of her busted-up
video card,

19:28.901 --> 19:30.303
maybe it would.

19:30.337 --> 19:31.971
Right now, Anna's the only one

19:32.004 --> 19:33.873
who could tell us
what really happened out there.

19:37.810 --> 19:40.247
"Sebastian Lund
and The Benthic Worm."

19:40.280 --> 19:43.416
"Live from
Jefferson Parish Morgue."

19:43.450 --> 19:44.884
BORIN:
I'm in.

19:44.917 --> 19:47.186
Who's taking me to the show?

19:48.255 --> 19:50.223
Thank you.

19:50.257 --> 19:51.391
Sebastian.

19:51.424 --> 19:52.892
Oh, Agent Pride, you're here.

19:52.925 --> 19:54.427
We are here.

19:56.929 --> 19:59.799
Oh. Hello.

19:59.832 --> 20:01.801
I'm sorry, I'm
just, I'm really

20:01.834 --> 20:02.902
freakin' excited right now.

20:02.935 --> 20:03.970
When I get this way,

20:04.003 --> 20:05.638
I tend to miss
glaring social cues.

20:05.672 --> 20:07.407
Like a gorgeous, imposing woman

20:07.440 --> 20:09.242
I don't know standing
right in front of me.

20:09.276 --> 20:11.244
I'm gonna stop talking.

20:11.278 --> 20:13.913
CGIS Special Agent
Abigail Borin.

20:13.946 --> 20:15.982
Agent Borin, yes, of course.

20:16.015 --> 20:17.884
Miss Sciuto in D.C.
has told me all about you.

20:17.917 --> 20:19.919
Love that Abby.
So, what do you got?

20:19.952 --> 20:21.254
Oh, well, uh,

20:21.288 --> 20:22.255
take a look at the monitor

20:22.289 --> 20:25.458
while I slide this in here.

20:26.493 --> 20:28.428
BORIN:
Hmm.

20:28.461 --> 20:30.597
Panspermia.

20:30.630 --> 20:32.832
Yeah, that's a very
astute observation.

20:32.865 --> 20:35.302
They do look like
microscopic alien life-forms

20:35.335 --> 20:38.505
that inhabited the universe by
getting trapped in debris...

20:38.538 --> 20:40.440
How the hell
do you know that?

20:40.473 --> 20:41.908
Are you a scientist?

20:41.941 --> 20:43.810
You work for the government?

20:43.843 --> 20:45.278
: Like,
the government, government?

20:45.312 --> 20:48.581
No, no, no. Just saw it on TV.

20:49.416 --> 20:51.684
Sebastian.

20:51.718 --> 20:52.485
Sebastian.
Hmm?

20:52.519 --> 20:55.355
What are they?
Oh, uh, meiobenthos.

20:55.388 --> 20:57.990
These beauties belong
to the group Gastrotricha.

20:58.024 --> 20:59.892
See, thing is,

20:59.926 --> 21:01.794
these little guys are only found

21:01.828 --> 21:04.364
in this area here;
to see one on land

21:04.397 --> 21:06.032
is incredibly rare.

21:06.065 --> 21:07.467
I mean, we should
consider ourselves really lucky.

21:07.500 --> 21:09.402
Like, we should go out
and play the lottery.

21:09.436 --> 21:10.403
So how does this

21:10.437 --> 21:11.338
connect to the case?

21:11.371 --> 21:13.373
Loretta pulled it
from Mark's wet suit.

21:13.406 --> 21:15.475
Meaning he was in that area.

21:15.508 --> 21:19.045
And Anna Huntley may be as well.

21:21.414 --> 21:24.917
We're looking at a live feed
from the UROV right now.

21:24.951 --> 21:28.455
UROV PILOT:
Approaching the target area now.

21:28.488 --> 21:29.956
There's something
over there.

21:29.989 --> 21:31.724
Yeah.

21:31.758 --> 21:33.059
Check your three o'clock,
Lieutenant.

21:33.092 --> 21:34.761
Looks like we could
have something.

21:34.794 --> 21:37.530
PILOT:
Turning 30 degrees starboard.

21:39.799 --> 21:42.402
Appears to be wreckage,
not a body, ma'am.

21:42.435 --> 21:45.071
No, it's not.

21:45.104 --> 21:49.108
Those look like silver
coins-- old silver coins.

21:49.141 --> 21:50.577
Treasure.

21:50.610 --> 21:53.513
And a motive
for murder.

22:06.559 --> 22:07.894
Ahoy, mateys!

22:08.695 --> 22:10.530
SEBASTIAN:
Hop on board the S.S. Sebastian.

22:10.563 --> 22:11.898
You got my message.
I did.

22:11.931 --> 22:13.466
As well as some samples
that Coast Guard

22:13.500 --> 22:15.134
Search and Rescue
pulled from the site.

22:15.167 --> 22:17.003
You guys may not have found
Anna Huntley's body,

22:17.036 --> 22:20.006
but you did find authentic
antique Spanish pesos.

22:20.039 --> 22:22.008
Ooh, pesos.
Yeah. Carbon-dated

22:22.041 --> 22:23.476
the coins to the mid 1700s.

22:23.510 --> 22:24.811
Pretty sure they came
from a Spanish wreck

22:24.844 --> 22:26.513
called the El Cazador.

22:26.546 --> 22:28.915
Boat was discovered in the
'90s, not all the silver was.

22:28.948 --> 22:31.584
But... none of that is
important, come look at this.

22:32.685 --> 22:34.020
See this, uh,

22:34.053 --> 22:35.488
discoloration here?
BORIN:
Mm-hmm.

22:35.522 --> 22:37.524
Watch what happens
when I drop some acid.

22:38.558 --> 22:40.660
For... science.

22:44.964 --> 22:47.066
The bubbles mean that
there was real silver here.

22:48.535 --> 22:50.770
How much is one of those
pesos worth today?

22:50.803 --> 22:51.738
About $500 a pop.

22:51.771 --> 22:53.406
The government
turned the area

22:53.440 --> 22:54.741
into a marine
research preserve

22:54.774 --> 22:55.775
before anyone
could figure out

22:55.808 --> 22:57.610
how many were
really down there.

22:57.644 --> 22:58.978
Makes you wonder what else
they're keeping from us.

22:59.011 --> 23:01.113
We should call
Mulder and Scully.

23:01.147 --> 23:04.050
Best villain:
Tooms or Pusher?
Tooms.

23:04.083 --> 23:06.519
Best episode:
"Squeeze" or "Drive"?
"Squeeze."

23:06.553 --> 23:07.620
Who are you?

23:09.155 --> 23:10.957
Okay, so...

23:10.990 --> 23:12.725
Anna steals
the pesos...

23:14.661 --> 23:18.431
...killed her friends
and escaped on the dingy, or...

23:18.465 --> 23:21.000
she got in the way
of someone who did.

23:21.033 --> 23:23.169
The truth is out there, Pride.

23:23.202 --> 23:24.604
We just haven't found it yet.

23:28.708 --> 23:30.076
Pride.

23:31.578 --> 23:34.180
Yes, sir.
Right.

23:35.515 --> 23:36.849
Admiral Huntley.

23:36.883 --> 23:39.452
Says his daughter is alive.

23:39.486 --> 23:41.521
And he has proof.

23:41.554 --> 23:44.857
BORIN: "I'm sorry.
Don't let Jeremy hate me.

23:44.891 --> 23:46.225
Make sure he has his Lamby."

23:46.258 --> 23:48.094
Lamby?

23:48.127 --> 23:50.096
A stuffed animal.

23:50.129 --> 23:52.465
Jeremy sleeps with it.

23:52.499 --> 23:55.101
I don't understand.

23:55.134 --> 23:57.704
Where's my daughter?
Sir,

23:57.737 --> 24:00.573
I have my people
running a trace.

24:00.607 --> 24:02.542
And we're still
searching for her,

24:02.575 --> 24:05.111
but based on these texts and
the lack of cell reception

24:05.144 --> 24:07.880
at sea, I mean, we got to guess
that she's on land.

24:07.914 --> 24:09.749
And on the run.

24:11.784 --> 24:14.787
Admiral Huntley, uh...

24:14.821 --> 24:16.723
we believe Anna may have
had something to do with

24:16.756 --> 24:18.925
what happened
on the RV Acadiana.

24:21.594 --> 24:23.563
You think that...

24:23.596 --> 24:26.599
my daughter killed these people?

24:26.633 --> 24:29.201
Why

24:29.235 --> 24:32.104
She was having serious
money problems.

24:32.138 --> 24:33.506
Student loans,
credit card debt.

24:33.540 --> 24:36.743
Even Jeremy's
preschool.

24:36.776 --> 24:39.679
Any ideas where she'd go
if she was in trouble?

24:39.712 --> 24:41.247
Who she'd
turn to for help?

24:41.280 --> 24:43.650
No. No, she...

24:43.683 --> 24:45.852
she would never confide in me.

24:45.885 --> 24:48.821
Even when she was pregnant with
Jeremy, she didn't tell me.

24:48.855 --> 24:51.924
When I did find out,
I pushed her away.

24:51.958 --> 24:52.925
Why?

24:52.959 --> 24:54.994
Guy she was with was scum.

24:55.027 --> 24:57.196
Would she try to contact him?

24:57.229 --> 24:58.998
No.

24:59.031 --> 25:01.167
No, he left her high and dry.
And she said fine,

25:01.200 --> 25:03.235
I'll raise the kid
on my own, I'll work,

25:03.269 --> 25:04.837
I'll put myself
through school and by God,

25:04.871 --> 25:06.706
that's exactly what she did.

25:06.739 --> 25:09.508
Course I wasn't there
to keep tabs on her.

25:11.310 --> 25:12.879
And now this.

25:12.912 --> 25:16.849
Well, it looks like
I screwed up with one kid

25:16.883 --> 25:18.885
and now I've been left
to screw up another.

25:21.754 --> 25:23.089
Oh, look at the truck.

25:23.122 --> 25:26.593
Aah!

25:28.094 --> 25:30.029
I just followed up
with the Coast Guard.

25:30.062 --> 25:32.231
Oh, wow,
your hands are sticky.

25:32.264 --> 25:33.800
Okay, Coast Guard.

25:33.833 --> 25:35.101
Yeah, no sign of Anna...

25:35.134 --> 25:37.336
Chris.

25:37.369 --> 25:39.872
Oh, yeah. Sorry, uh,

25:39.906 --> 25:42.041
no sign of you-know-who

25:42.074 --> 25:44.310
D-E-A-D or
A-L-I-V-E.

25:44.343 --> 25:46.178
Cell phone?

25:46.212 --> 25:49.716
Mm, tried, no signal.
It's been shut down. Nothing.

25:49.749 --> 25:52.885
It's hard to believe
she's the K-I-L-L-E-R.

25:52.919 --> 25:55.187
Well, she does have M-O-T-I-V-E.

25:55.221 --> 25:57.023
I don't think
you have to spell that one.

25:57.056 --> 25:59.158
I can't imagine anyone

25:59.191 --> 26:00.993
doing something that would
cause them to run away

26:01.027 --> 26:02.962
from these cute cheeks.

26:02.995 --> 26:04.330
Lasalle here.
I think you have
very cute cheeks.

26:04.363 --> 26:05.998
What?

26:07.199 --> 26:10.169
Okay, thanks.

26:10.202 --> 26:11.070
You okay?

26:11.103 --> 26:13.105
Yeah, my brother.
He's running again.

26:15.775 --> 26:17.744
Don't do this.

26:17.777 --> 26:19.345
Don't leave.
I have to.

26:19.378 --> 26:21.213
See, there's things
that you don't know.

26:21.247 --> 26:23.750
Bad things.

26:23.783 --> 26:25.017
They're gonna find me.

26:25.051 --> 26:28.020
What do you mean?
Chris,

26:28.054 --> 26:30.156
unless I've committed a crime

26:30.189 --> 26:31.824
or I've threatened somebody,

26:31.858 --> 26:32.992
you can't keep me here.

26:33.025 --> 26:36.328
We've sung
this tune before, buddy.

26:36.362 --> 26:39.098
Look, Cade, just stop.
Look, stay here

26:39.131 --> 26:41.934
and take your
medication.

26:43.302 --> 26:47.106
Medication's supposed
to make you feel better.

26:47.139 --> 26:49.308
These make it so I don't
feel like myself.

26:50.843 --> 26:52.311
I feel like
some numb, stupid

26:52.344 --> 26:54.947
version of myself, Chris.

26:56.048 --> 26:57.416
I'm sorry,
buddy,

26:57.449 --> 26:58.918
I'm hitting the road.

26:58.951 --> 27:00.286
Come on, wait a sec.

27:00.319 --> 27:02.321
Look, you know where
this goes from here.

27:02.354 --> 27:05.257
You walk out that
door and...

27:05.291 --> 27:07.259
and Mom goes into
her own tailspin.

27:07.293 --> 27:10.196
Doesn't eat,
doesn't sleep.

27:10.229 --> 27:12.865
And I go back to
worrying about you.

27:14.333 --> 27:18.137
Look...

27:18.170 --> 27:20.306
Let's fix this.

27:20.339 --> 27:22.875
Together.

27:22.909 --> 27:24.911
You and me, all right?

27:29.916 --> 27:31.918
Can I ask you a question?

27:35.487 --> 27:38.124
If I had cancer...

27:38.157 --> 27:41.427
would you still be blaming
me for being sick?

27:43.229 --> 27:46.398
I ain't blaming you
for being sick.

27:46.432 --> 27:48.400
I'm just pissed off you ain't

27:48.434 --> 27:50.402
fighting like hell
to get better.

27:56.475 --> 27:59.378
I'm not a fighter, Chris.

27:59.411 --> 28:00.747
That's-That's you.

28:00.780 --> 28:04.083
We both know that.

28:04.116 --> 28:07.787
Hey, you don't need
my troubles, anyway.

28:07.820 --> 28:09.989
All right? I-I'll see you
when I see you, Chris.

28:31.343 --> 28:34.446
Texts Anna sent came
from land, which explains

28:34.480 --> 28:36.215
why your people
couldn't find her.

28:36.248 --> 28:38.384
Maybe, but...
you know my gut.

28:38.417 --> 28:40.853
I-I just got a weird
feeling about this one.

28:40.887 --> 28:44.123
Maybe it's that Food Mart
sludge you got in your hand.

28:44.156 --> 28:46.859
More like mud,
but it'll do the trick.
Hmm.

28:48.327 --> 28:50.296
So we're saying Anna

28:50.329 --> 28:52.899
pulled up a bunch of treasure
from the bottom of the ocean

28:52.932 --> 28:55.167
and then she killed
her friends over it and then

28:55.201 --> 28:56.302
she's trying to sell it?

28:56.335 --> 28:58.504
Too much crime for one person.

28:58.537 --> 29:00.472
An accomplice?

29:00.506 --> 29:03.142
No evidence showing
that anybody else

29:03.175 --> 29:05.444
was involved in the murder.

29:05.477 --> 29:08.414
How do you turn
old money into new?

29:08.447 --> 29:11.884
Bitcoin.
There are lots of ways
to change antique money

29:11.918 --> 29:13.319
on the black market--
you can launder it,

29:13.352 --> 29:16.355
go to some underground
collector, or use bitcoin.

29:16.388 --> 29:18.324
How's it work?
Peer-to-peer

29:18.357 --> 29:20.326
cryptocurrency exchange.

29:20.359 --> 29:23.395
I dug into the Deep Web,
I posed as a buyer

29:23.429 --> 29:26.365
and I found a guy selling pesos
from the El Cazador site.

29:26.398 --> 29:29.501
Got 100 of them.
Here's his Web site right here.

29:29.535 --> 29:31.503
BRODY:
Steven Merris.

29:31.537 --> 29:34.373
Booty Hauls
salvage tour service.

29:34.406 --> 29:36.475
"Ride my booty."
That's classy.

29:36.508 --> 29:38.377
Any record of violence?

29:38.410 --> 29:40.379
Really? "Ride my booty"
not violent enough for you?

29:40.412 --> 29:42.348
No record.

29:42.381 --> 29:45.217
But a few months back
he had a slip at the marina

29:45.251 --> 29:47.219
the RV Acadia was docked.

29:47.253 --> 29:51.023
What do you bet Merris
and Anna made some kind of deal?

29:51.057 --> 29:52.558
NCIS.

29:52.591 --> 29:55.494
We have a few questions for
you about the El Cazador.

29:55.527 --> 29:57.529
That's in a marine preserve,
off-limits.

29:57.563 --> 29:58.364
My tours don't go there.

29:58.397 --> 30:00.366
Then, uh...

30:00.399 --> 30:02.401
who's been fronting you
the silver pesos?

30:05.437 --> 30:07.206
This girl, Anna Huntley?

30:07.239 --> 30:08.540
Never seen her before.

30:08.574 --> 30:11.143
Hey, what are you, uh,
what are you doing?

30:11.177 --> 30:14.513
Exactly what it looks
like I'm doing-- poking around.

30:14.546 --> 30:16.582
I don't think this
should take very long.

30:21.587 --> 30:22.955
BORIN:
Hey, Pride.

30:22.989 --> 30:25.557
That look familiar to you?

30:25.591 --> 30:27.459
Same as Anna's boat.

30:28.660 --> 30:31.430
Hey, Merris, you ever drop acid?

30:43.542 --> 30:45.211
Huh.

30:45.244 --> 30:48.314
Antique silver pesos.

30:48.347 --> 30:49.348
Wonder where
you got these.

30:51.683 --> 30:54.053
BORIN: Okay, you take the boats,
I'll cut him off.

30:54.086 --> 30:55.354
PRIDE: Brody,
secure the evidence!

31:14.273 --> 31:16.642
Got him?
I got him.

31:16.675 --> 31:18.544
Come on...
Come here!

31:18.577 --> 31:20.179
PRIDE: Get down...
Come here!

31:20.212 --> 31:21.547
Aah! I broke my ankle!

31:22.548 --> 31:24.050
Yeah. I had him.

31:24.083 --> 31:25.284
You did.

31:25.317 --> 31:26.552
Thank you.

31:26.585 --> 31:27.653
I need a doctor, I'm hurt.

31:27.686 --> 31:29.388
BOTH:
Shut up.

31:32.558 --> 31:34.593
Those were a gift from a client.

31:34.626 --> 31:36.062
Then why'd you run?

31:37.663 --> 31:39.631
Come on, Merris.

31:39.665 --> 31:41.633
We know you've been selling
your booty on the Internet.

31:42.969 --> 31:44.436
Did I really just say that?

31:44.470 --> 31:46.338
You were illegally
excavating El Cazador

31:46.372 --> 31:49.041
when the Acadiana
waded up.

31:49.075 --> 31:51.477
You'd finally found
your Atlantis,

31:51.510 --> 31:53.179
worked too hard to let

31:53.212 --> 31:55.047
some punk grad students ruin it,
so you killed them.

31:55.081 --> 31:56.615
I didn't kill anyone.
You did.

31:56.648 --> 31:58.617
Either on your own
or with Anna Huntley's help.

31:58.650 --> 32:01.353
This girl's been
salvaging the Cazador?

32:01.387 --> 32:02.955
I've been working
my ass off for years

32:02.989 --> 32:04.223
trying to bring up those pesos.

32:04.256 --> 32:05.491
Sometimes at night,

32:05.524 --> 32:07.493
Jelly fish stings,
and in the heat.

32:07.526 --> 32:09.495
Sounds awful.

32:09.528 --> 32:11.163
Merris, go on.

32:11.197 --> 32:13.465
I think
this girl's my competition.

32:13.499 --> 32:15.634
Last couple of days, she's
been driving down the bitcoin

32:15.667 --> 32:17.403
price on the pesos.

32:18.604 --> 32:20.672
Does she have a screen name?

32:20.706 --> 32:22.641
Sunkentreasure14.

32:22.674 --> 32:24.010
Original.

32:24.043 --> 32:25.477
I'll let Patton know.

32:29.015 --> 32:30.682
He tell you what
kind of trouble?

32:30.716 --> 32:33.052
No, Cade didn't say.

32:33.085 --> 32:37.689
Could just be some story
he made up in his head.

32:37.723 --> 32:40.592
If he would just stay put.

32:42.428 --> 32:43.462
You can't fix him.

32:43.495 --> 32:45.397
Yeah, I know.

32:45.431 --> 32:48.067
But I can't do nothing.

32:48.100 --> 32:49.268
You know that.

32:49.301 --> 32:51.537
It's not me.

32:51.570 --> 32:55.141
Best thing you can do
is just be there...

32:55.174 --> 32:57.676
when he's ready.

32:57.709 --> 32:59.478
What if he never is?

32:59.511 --> 33:01.647
Then he never is.

33:02.781 --> 33:05.517
Christopher,
sometimes people just

33:05.551 --> 33:07.086
need to know
that someone's willing

33:07.119 --> 33:09.655
to take a chance on them,
no matter what.

33:12.658 --> 33:15.594
Someone did that
for me, once.

33:15.627 --> 33:17.596
Hmm. Yes, they did.

33:19.665 --> 33:21.567
Patton.

33:22.801 --> 33:23.802
Talk to me.

33:23.835 --> 33:25.571
Meet SunkenTreasure14.

33:25.604 --> 33:27.606
BRODY:
Anna.

33:27.639 --> 33:29.141
If Merris is to
be believed.

33:29.175 --> 33:30.576
How come we couldn't
find her before?

33:30.609 --> 33:33.145
Well, her Deep Web storefront
was being concealed by

33:33.179 --> 33:35.581
an Onion Router--
that's tech, not a food.

33:35.614 --> 33:37.683
Good to know.
PATTON:
Anyway, I got in.

33:37.716 --> 33:39.718
I got chatty,
I learned that she is

33:39.751 --> 33:41.653
selling antique Spanish Pesos.

33:41.687 --> 33:43.055
I reached out to her,
she agreed

33:43.089 --> 33:45.724
to an authentication
meet in an hour.

33:45.757 --> 33:47.726
Tell SunkenTreasure we'll
meet her at the chess tables

33:47.759 --> 33:48.694
at Jackson Square.

33:48.727 --> 33:49.695
We'll reserve a table for her.

33:49.728 --> 33:52.664
Got it.
Come on.

33:52.698 --> 33:55.101
*

34:04.876 --> 34:08.780
:
I got a lady in a gray hat,

34:08.814 --> 34:11.083
and red scarf,
just like Patton said.

34:11.117 --> 34:12.851
On your toes, everyone.

34:12.884 --> 34:14.786
LASALLE:
Headed your way, Borin.

34:14.820 --> 34:16.688
Yeah, I see her.

34:25.797 --> 34:27.766
It's not Anna.

34:27.799 --> 34:30.736
NCIS. Hands up.

34:31.803 --> 34:33.105
Hands up.

34:36.808 --> 34:38.877
Professor Jones.

34:38.910 --> 34:42.314
Just needed to make
some change, huh?

34:42.348 --> 34:44.150
I-I, I don't know
what you think I did.

34:44.183 --> 34:45.651
"Think"? Try "know."

34:45.684 --> 34:46.818
You took Anna's cell phone,

34:46.852 --> 34:48.754
you texted Admiral Huntley.

34:48.787 --> 34:50.222
Made it look like
his daughter did all of this.

34:50.256 --> 34:52.191
Th-Th-This wasn't
supposed to happen.

34:52.224 --> 34:53.792
It was just a stupid accident.

34:53.825 --> 34:55.661
I spent my entire life working,
researching,

34:55.694 --> 34:57.529
nothing to show for my work,
no money.

34:57.563 --> 34:59.765
Corporations, oil companies--
they make billions

34:59.798 --> 35:01.733
trashing the environment,
and I get nothing.

35:01.767 --> 35:04.170
I proposed we split it,
they refused.

35:04.203 --> 35:06.438
Mark threatened to throw it
overboard. The... the... the...

35:06.472 --> 35:08.207
She has a child!

35:08.240 --> 35:10.742
Do you understand that?
A little boy.

35:10.776 --> 35:12.444
Did you even think about that?!

35:14.280 --> 35:16.782
Look, I panicked.
I panicked, okay?

35:16.815 --> 35:19.751
And I-I went for the safety gun,
and then... then,

35:19.785 --> 35:21.187
Mark lunged for it,
and it... and it went off.

35:21.220 --> 35:22.854
And he lun... he fell back,
and he hit his head,

35:22.888 --> 35:24.823
and then, Cindy was screaming,
and then... and then...

35:24.856 --> 35:27.859
and then, Anna got the gun,
and then, I got it back.

35:27.893 --> 35:29.195
And then, I...

35:29.228 --> 35:30.862
And then, you shot her,

35:30.896 --> 35:32.631
and then, you shot all of them.

35:32.664 --> 35:33.565
I...

35:33.599 --> 35:36.768
For her family...

35:36.802 --> 35:40.306
can you tell us
where we can find her body?

35:45.577 --> 35:47.213
PRIDE: They found her body
a quarter-mile

35:47.246 --> 35:49.215
from the El Cazador site.

35:49.248 --> 35:50.782
She was lying just below
the surface,

35:50.816 --> 35:51.817
tucked in a reef.

35:53.819 --> 35:56.188
Search and Rescue
pulled her up from there.

35:58.890 --> 36:03.795
Doc Wade said Anna died
of a single gunshot wound--

36:03.829 --> 36:06.398
a through-and-through,
she called it.

36:11.970 --> 36:13.972
But there's something else.

36:14.005 --> 36:16.808
Dr. Wade found

36:16.842 --> 36:20.879
metal from the zipper
of Anna's wet suit

36:20.912 --> 36:23.849
inside one of
Cindy's bullet wounds.

36:25.984 --> 36:27.253
I don't understand.

36:27.286 --> 36:29.755
It means that

36:29.788 --> 36:32.958
Anna must have jumped
in front of Cindy

36:32.991 --> 36:35.827
when Professor Jones
fired at her.

36:36.662 --> 36:38.630
Admiral...

36:38.664 --> 36:41.833
your daughter died
trying to protect her friend.

36:49.475 --> 36:51.810
She was always braver than me.

36:56.648 --> 36:59.418
When I found out
she was pregnant with Jeremy,

36:59.451 --> 37:03.722
I, um... fought like hell
for her... not to have him.

37:05.491 --> 37:07.793
Now...

37:07.826 --> 37:10.696
thank God she did.

37:12.331 --> 37:14.933
I'm sure you'll do her
memory proud, Admiral.

37:14.966 --> 37:17.469
Damn right.

37:17.503 --> 37:19.271
I'm going to care for Jeremy,

37:19.305 --> 37:22.908
and I'm gonna be there for him,
like I never was for her.

37:26.545 --> 37:28.914
Thank you. Excuse me.

37:28.947 --> 37:31.383
Sure.

37:31.417 --> 37:32.818
ANNA :
It's perfect out here.

37:32.851 --> 37:35.020
But don't worry at all...

37:35.053 --> 37:36.722
Come to Grandpa.

37:36.755 --> 37:38.590
Mommy's coming home soon, okay?

37:38.624 --> 37:42.528
And one day, we are gonna sail
across the ocean, Jeremy,

37:42.561 --> 37:43.562
just you and me.

37:43.595 --> 37:45.364
Mama loves you so much, baby.

37:45.397 --> 37:47.933
I'll see you soon, okay?

37:52.871 --> 37:54.906
BORIN:
You got a good crew, Pride.

37:54.940 --> 37:56.608
Hope I didn't push
too many buttons.

37:57.976 --> 38:00.579
It's what you do.
It gets the job done.

38:00.612 --> 38:03.949
You're a good agent
with good instincts.

38:03.982 --> 38:05.951
Thanks.

38:05.984 --> 38:08.554
Sure I can't get you a cab?

38:08.587 --> 38:11.923
And miss a walk through
the corridor? Not a chance.

38:11.957 --> 38:15.594
Next time, we're
getting a bourbon.

38:15.627 --> 38:17.996
Or a Sazerac.
Mm!

38:18.029 --> 38:19.431
Even better.

38:24.470 --> 38:28.474
* I was fresh
out of the service *

38:28.507 --> 38:31.577
* It was back in '82

38:31.610 --> 38:35.881
* I raised some Cain
when I come back to town... *

38:37.716 --> 38:40.486
You know, before I changed
my name to Rich Kimble...

38:40.519 --> 38:43.822
I was going with Cade
Caulfield there for a while.

38:43.855 --> 38:46.358
As in Holden?

38:48.093 --> 38:50.061
You know the first time

38:50.095 --> 38:53.499
J.D. Salinger wrote about Holden
Caulfield was in a short story?

38:53.532 --> 38:56.034
Two-word title.

38:56.067 --> 38:57.869
"I'm Crazy."

38:58.937 --> 39:01.440
I'm, uh...

39:01.473 --> 39:04.576
I'm sorry about earlier, Chris.

39:06.645 --> 39:08.914
What you said
back at the hospital

39:08.947 --> 39:11.049
about all

39:11.082 --> 39:12.551
the bad things--

39:12.584 --> 39:14.753
was that even real?

39:17.723 --> 39:20.592
Wish it wasn't.

39:25.764 --> 39:27.933
Oh, we'll figure it out.

39:27.966 --> 39:30.502
Together.

39:31.903 --> 39:34.706
Till then, we got
'Bama hoops on tonight.

39:34.740 --> 39:36.542
Gonna put a whooping on LSU.

39:36.575 --> 39:38.544
Got some beers
in the fridge

39:38.577 --> 39:40.045
and some steaks, too.

39:43.615 --> 39:45.817
I can go for that.

39:47.619 --> 39:50.121
Roll tide.

39:50.155 --> 39:54.593
* Swing low and carry me home.
