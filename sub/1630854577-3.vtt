WEBVTT

00:07.215 --> 00:08.216
Where's Sonic?

00:10.093 --> 00:12.053
How long does it take to collect rings?

00:12.137 --> 00:14.472
I thought we were doing this together.

00:16.349 --> 00:19.394
Sure would be nice
if he'd stick to the plan.

00:27.694 --> 00:28.862
Tell me about it.

00:28.945 --> 00:31.072
No gem is worth me losing my wings.

00:37.245 --> 00:40.040
Don't worry, guys,
Sonic will show. I know he will.

00:41.374 --> 00:44.502
I just hope it's in time.

00:48.548 --> 00:50.550
Oh, no. My friends.

00:50.633 --> 00:52.719
Look, Shadow, I'm late for--

00:52.802 --> 00:53.845
Learn to focus.

00:55.054 --> 00:57.474
Oh, no! Eggman!

00:57.557 --> 01:00.643
-Huh?

01:00.727 --> 01:03.521
Hate to hit and run,
but I gotta split, Shadow.

01:23.458 --> 01:26.044
Whoa... uh... Shadow?

01:46.940 --> 01:48.066
Terminate.

02:00.495 --> 02:02.747
<i>Now paired.</i>

02:09.546 --> 02:12.423
New admin privileges, colon, backslash,

02:12.507 --> 02:15.051
backslash, affirmative, now paired.

02:16.219 --> 02:18.638
Huh? "Paired"?

02:18.721 --> 02:20.140
What does she mean, "paired"?

02:20.223 --> 02:23.059
Amy, are you... you?

02:23.143 --> 02:26.437
No, she's still a Chaos Council
tool of destruction.

02:26.521 --> 02:29.607
Lucky for you,
I'm in control of the robot now.

02:29.691 --> 02:31.401
You're welcome. Attack!

02:39.701 --> 02:42.662
What in the name of omelets
have they done with Rusty?

02:42.745 --> 02:44.289
To the security room!

03:08.980 --> 03:10.231
Whoa...!

03:10.315 --> 03:12.775
Tell ya what, if I had my...

03:22.827 --> 03:25.788
Rusty Rose, close that door.

03:34.464 --> 03:36.716
Uh... she's with us now?

03:36.799 --> 03:37.800
Duh!

03:46.976 --> 03:49.646
We did it! Bring it in, fam!

03:49.729 --> 03:51.648
-Hey, hey, hey, hey, get off!

03:51.731 --> 03:52.649
Huh.

03:52.732 --> 03:56.361
Oh, yeah, the whole
"Eggman messed up the universe thing."

03:56.444 --> 03:57.528
Okay.

03:58.821 --> 04:00.073
Fine.

04:00.156 --> 04:02.492
Introductions. Hello, I'm Sonic,

04:02.575 --> 04:05.245
the high-speed hedgehog hero
who's always saving the day.

04:05.328 --> 04:08.331
And this wily little fox
is the crusty but benign Tails--

04:08.414 --> 04:12.377
Nine. It's Nine.
The emphasis is on the Nine.

04:12.460 --> 04:15.546
And these two slightly
thuggish party crashers

04:15.630 --> 04:19.467
consist of the alluring and kick-butt
international bat of mystery, Rouge...

04:21.010 --> 04:22.345
It's Rebel.

04:22.428 --> 04:24.764
-And Knuckles.
-It's Knucks.

04:24.847 --> 04:26.516
And will someone please stop this laser?

04:26.599 --> 04:28.226
And Amy is...

04:28.309 --> 04:32.105
I am a killing machine
created by the Chaos Council

04:32.188 --> 04:34.732
to enforce their autocratic rule.

04:34.816 --> 04:38.361
Well, Amy's the sweetest friend
you could ever ask for.

04:42.115 --> 04:44.534
But... no one remembers any of that.

04:44.617 --> 04:46.703
So, we're going to fix it

04:46.786 --> 04:49.872
because we got
the whole band back together.

04:52.375 --> 04:54.794
This way, or you're finished.

05:03.928 --> 05:06.681
<i>You've been hacked by Nine.</i>

05:08.433 --> 05:12.145
Gah! Patch us into all
the badnicks for visuals.

05:12.228 --> 05:13.646
Find them!

05:13.730 --> 05:16.524
Dr. Deep, we can't let them escape!

05:16.607 --> 05:19.319
Totes. So gonna destroy.

05:43.092 --> 05:44.302
Deep, grow up!

05:45.219 --> 05:47.013
And your dance moves stink.

05:47.096 --> 05:48.931
Find them!

06:15.166 --> 06:18.002
Baddies this way. Baddies that way.

06:18.544 --> 06:20.129
They're coming from both sides.

06:32.308 --> 06:34.060
Come on, gotta get out of here.

06:36.646 --> 06:39.440
Wait, stop.
We shouldn't be trying to escape.

06:39.524 --> 06:42.276
What are you talking about?
There's robots after us.

06:42.360 --> 06:44.237
We get our hands on their energy crystal,

06:44.320 --> 06:46.072
we shut down their entire operation...

06:46.155 --> 06:48.116
...and take back our world.

06:48.866 --> 06:51.369
"Crystal"? "Energy crystal"?

06:51.452 --> 06:54.372
Hold-a-wait-a-what-a-sec.
Did you say crystal?

06:54.455 --> 06:58.835
Is it a big crystal thingy?
Shiny, reflect-y, prism-y?

06:58.918 --> 07:00.086
Sure.

07:00.169 --> 07:02.421
The Paradox Prism. Of course!

07:05.049 --> 07:06.884
That's how Eggman did all this.

07:06.968 --> 07:09.512
The changed city, the messed-up you guys.

07:09.595 --> 07:12.682
If I can get it,
maybe I can change it all back.

07:12.765 --> 07:14.725
Rusty Amy, where's the prism?

07:14.809 --> 07:16.519
Rusty Rose.

07:16.602 --> 07:19.730
Do not have clearance
to the subsectors of the core.

07:19.814 --> 07:23.192
Subsectors?
I can make my own clearance.

07:30.908 --> 07:34.328
In case of emergency,
always use the stairs.

07:38.499 --> 07:42.879
Come on, team.
Together, we're gonna fix the world.

07:49.677 --> 07:51.053
Aha!

07:56.767 --> 07:59.145
Ow!

07:59.228 --> 08:02.190
Prepare to be amazed,
then deceased,

08:02.273 --> 08:05.610
by the one and only Dr. Deep.

08:07.570 --> 08:08.988
Uh-huh!

08:09.071 --> 08:10.907
Okay, actually cool.

08:30.801 --> 08:32.220
Rahh-huh!

08:34.514 --> 08:35.640
Aah!

08:37.475 --> 08:38.643
Aah!

08:40.144 --> 08:41.646
-Ahh!

08:41.729 --> 08:43.731
Hyah!

08:51.906 --> 08:53.241
Aah!

09:32.780 --> 09:34.031
Whoo!

09:40.329 --> 09:42.415
Thanks for the save. High five.

09:43.916 --> 09:45.793
"High... five"?

09:46.460 --> 09:49.922
Divert more energy from the crystal
to the pods immediately!

10:08.941 --> 10:10.192
Yes.

10:19.619 --> 10:22.538
We're done for.
They're too powerful, too fast.

10:22.622 --> 10:25.791
"Too fast"? You need to learn
to spin-dash, my friend.

10:25.875 --> 10:28.753
-Spin-dash?
-Watch and learn.

10:32.214 --> 10:33.924
Ah, coconuts!

10:34.800 --> 10:36.927
You're up!
You see that bad guy over there?

10:37.011 --> 10:39.930
-Uh, yeah.
-Now spin.

10:43.559 --> 10:44.769
You too.

11:09.210 --> 11:11.629
What kind of budget
are these guys working with?

11:11.712 --> 11:14.215
We're at the sub level. Where's the exit?

11:15.132 --> 11:16.133
Found it!

11:17.635 --> 11:19.428
We lost them!

11:20.721 --> 11:22.348
Wake up, Dr. Deep.

11:22.431 --> 11:24.350
Find those rebels!

11:26.227 --> 11:27.269
Ohh!

11:28.437 --> 11:30.272
That was awesome!

11:30.356 --> 11:32.525
Good work, team. Let's go.

11:34.485 --> 11:37.696
Your shoes. Stop, it's that way.

11:38.697 --> 11:40.032
Well, how do you know?

11:40.116 --> 11:43.327
He's connected to the prism energy,
and thanks to my handiwork,

11:43.411 --> 11:46.038
his shoes are picking up
on the energy's signature.

11:46.122 --> 11:48.958
He's right.
It's like they're calling out to it.

11:49.041 --> 11:53.712
Look. Hot, cold.
Hotter, colder, blazing hot.

11:53.796 --> 11:54.797
Uh...

11:55.673 --> 11:59.468
I'm going to origami that hedgehog!
Find them!

12:00.177 --> 12:01.679
Come on, let's go.

12:10.855 --> 12:12.148
Huh?

12:14.692 --> 12:16.569
They're headed for the core.

12:16.652 --> 12:18.279
They're headed for the core!

12:18.362 --> 12:19.989
Guys, guys, guys!

12:29.248 --> 12:31.125
That's gotta be it.

12:35.629 --> 12:38.340
Shut it down! Shut it down!

12:38.424 --> 12:40.009
<i>Close all corridors!</i>

12:40.092 --> 12:41.969
They're shutting the doors! Hurry!

12:52.480 --> 12:54.940
Open the doors! Open the doors!

13:08.704 --> 13:11.040
I guess dreams don't come true.

13:11.123 --> 13:13.709
Aw, come on.
You don't believe that, do you?

13:14.376 --> 13:16.712
Well, prove me wrong.

14:10.724 --> 14:11.976
Ohh.

14:12.059 --> 14:13.060
Aah!

14:21.902 --> 14:23.821
That's him-- the blue hedgehog!

14:37.376 --> 14:41.046
Enough with the baby.
Give me the old man for once.

14:46.385 --> 14:48.053
Nine, how we doing over there?

14:51.140 --> 14:52.808
I need more time.

14:52.892 --> 14:56.520
Hey, it's me you want. Come and get me.

15:05.154 --> 15:08.699
Who wants to play follow the leader?
Cannonball!

15:13.746 --> 15:16.040
What do you say? Once around the park?

16:35.869 --> 16:37.496
All-star move.

16:58.892 --> 17:02.271
Ah, the sweet sounds
of crying baby tyrants.

17:02.354 --> 17:04.148
Music to my ears.

17:07.234 --> 17:09.486
Whoa, déjà vu all over again.

17:17.161 --> 17:18.704
Sorry, Big. Sorry, Froggy.

17:18.787 --> 17:21.290
Can't chat. Gotta go save our friends.

17:21.373 --> 17:24.960
Okay, this is all a little too familiar.

17:41.935 --> 17:43.062
Too late, Sonic!

17:48.358 --> 17:49.443
I got it, we're in.

17:58.327 --> 18:00.496
Sonic, we didn't think you'd make it back.

18:00.579 --> 18:03.832
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

18:03.916 --> 18:05.626
Come on, let's go.

18:05.709 --> 18:08.629
Yeah, I thought you'd be flatter
than a snake's belly.

18:08.712 --> 18:10.339
-Whoa!

18:11.340 --> 18:13.884
Need a job done right, do it yourself.

18:13.967 --> 18:16.970
Step away from the core,
or your friends are toast.

18:17.846 --> 18:19.848
Sonic, we have to get to the core!

18:19.932 --> 18:22.518
No. I've got to help my friends.

18:22.601 --> 18:24.478
Ahh!

18:28.107 --> 18:30.859
Sonic, go. You have to get
to the Paradox Prism,

18:30.943 --> 18:32.611
or it'll all be for nothing.

18:35.405 --> 18:36.907
You heard her. Come on.

18:39.076 --> 18:40.577
Come on!

18:43.205 --> 18:45.249
Wait. Is that...?

18:48.335 --> 18:53.048
It's not the Paradox Prism.
It's way too tiny.

18:53.132 --> 18:55.717
The Prism was... was...

19:00.347 --> 19:02.641
<i>We don't know</i>
<i>what the prism is capable of.</i>

19:03.767 --> 19:05.102
<i>Be careful.</i>

19:07.104 --> 19:08.564
<i>I remember now.</i>

19:08.981 --> 19:10.232
<i>Sonic!</i>

19:12.359 --> 19:13.986
I was too focused on winning.

19:14.987 --> 19:16.488
I didn't listen. I...

19:17.614 --> 19:19.366
They tried to warn me.

19:22.035 --> 19:23.120
All of them.

19:25.622 --> 19:27.624
All this time, I thought Eggman

19:27.708 --> 19:29.877
figured out how to harness
the prism energy,

19:29.960 --> 19:32.421
and that's why everything's so whacked.

19:32.504 --> 19:34.006
But it's not that.

19:34.089 --> 19:36.300
Eggman didn't create this world...

19:53.525 --> 19:54.943
<i>I did.</i>

20:08.290 --> 20:09.833
I shattered the Paradox Prism.

20:09.917 --> 20:13.295
I broke... everything.

20:14.379 --> 20:18.926
So, this is just one small shard
of a bigger energy source?

20:20.427 --> 20:22.346
There's... more?

20:29.228 --> 20:31.355
You've said a lot of weird stuff
since I met you,

20:31.438 --> 20:32.898
and that's the weirdest.

20:32.981 --> 20:37.486
So, snap back to reality, grab that chart,
and we'll sort the rest out later.

20:37.569 --> 20:39.488
No, you... he...

20:39.571 --> 20:42.157
The original you
told me not to touch it.

20:42.241 --> 20:44.284
Well, I'm telling you the opposite.

20:44.368 --> 20:45.953
Now, grab it and let's go.

20:47.287 --> 20:50.207
Right, I broke it, but we can fix this.

20:51.041 --> 20:54.670
If there's anyone who's got the brains
to put it all back together, it's you.

20:54.753 --> 20:57.589
That's the first thing you've said
that I agree with.

21:08.433 --> 21:10.060
Sonic, what's happening?

21:10.143 --> 21:12.271
Nine! Nine!

21:14.356 --> 21:15.857
Sonic!

21:15.941 --> 21:19.069
Sonic, where are you? Sonic!

21:20.612 --> 21:21.613
Sonic?

21:24.574 --> 21:25.659
Sonic?
