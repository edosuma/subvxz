M_I_SForEver

05:02.979 --> 05:05.415
I'm so happy.

05:05.448 --> 05:07.750
I didn't think I could
ever be this happy.

05:07.784 --> 05:09.585
Me neither.

05:10.285 --> 05:14.757
I'm gonna spend the rest of my
life making sure you're this happy.

05:14.791 --> 05:16.426
I appreciate the sentiment,

05:16.459 --> 05:18.461
but we both know
that's not possible.

05:18.494 --> 05:21.431
I can get pretty grouchy.

05:21.464 --> 05:24.567
Mmm.
And I'll love you through it.

05:38.313 --> 05:40.183
It's good to see it too, Terry.

05:41.084 --> 05:42.051
You married into this.

05:44.020 --> 05:46.723
- How old are you?
- Not as old as you, Grandpa.

05:49.525 --> 05:52.662
- Congratulations again, you two.
- Thanks, Chase.

05:52.695 --> 05:55.297
So, Chase, as my best man,

05:55.330 --> 05:57.033
I kinda need you
to do me a favor.

05:57.066 --> 05:59.902
- Name it.
- Yeah, get Terry away from my wife.

06:01.170 --> 06:04.040
- You got it.
- What? I'm only dancing.

06:04.073 --> 06:05.475
Shut up Terry.

06:08.444 --> 06:11.047
I'm sorry.
Where were we?

06:16.085 --> 06:18.020
- Babe, hold my earrings.
- Yeah.

06:18.054 --> 06:19.489
- They bothering you?
- A little bit.

06:19.522 --> 06:23.059
Okay. No problem, my love.

06:26.129 --> 06:28.698
Benny.

06:28.731 --> 06:31.134
- Benny? What?
- Hello, Grace.

06:32.769 --> 06:34.570
Lucas, honey, this is Benny.

06:36.606 --> 06:39.942
Yeah. Hey, Benny.
Grace told me all about you.

06:39.976 --> 06:42.445
It's, um...
It's nice to meet you.

06:42.478 --> 06:44.180
Likewise.

06:44.213 --> 06:46.849
And congratulations...
to both of you, that is.

06:46.883 --> 06:48.117
Thank you.

06:50.386 --> 06:52.354
So, Benny, I didn't know
you'd be attending.

06:53.456 --> 06:55.057
Oh, I see.

06:55.091 --> 06:58.261
I mean, I'm glad
to see you, though.

06:58.326 --> 07:00.196
I'm glad to see you too, Grace.

07:00.229 --> 07:01.864
And of course I'd attend.
How could I not?

07:03.633 --> 07:08.237
Hey, well, um, Benny,
thank you for stopping by.

07:08.271 --> 07:09.872
Yes, of course.

07:09.906 --> 07:11.774
Thanks for coming.
It's so good to see you.

07:11.808 --> 07:14.410
It's always nice
to see you, Grace.

07:14.443 --> 07:19.115
So, uh, Benny, Grace tells me you
haven't spoken in a few years.

07:19.148 --> 07:22.985
- What have you been up to?
- Oh, you know, this and that.

07:24.620 --> 07:26.823
- Brooklyn!
- Nice to see you!

07:28.758 --> 07:30.660
I... I'm gonna get
some more of those crab bites.

07:30.693 --> 07:33.095
Yeah, you, uh... you do that.

07:33.129 --> 07:35.298
- Did I interrupt something?
- Girl, you saved us.

07:35.330 --> 07:36.933
- Okay.
- Hey, Brook.

07:36.966 --> 07:38.568
- Hey, Luke.
- Thanks for coming.

07:38.601 --> 07:40.335
Oh, I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

07:41.871 --> 07:44.106
Can you believe I actually
got this guy down the aisle?

07:44.140 --> 07:47.610
No, I can't,
but I'm happy for you.

07:47.643 --> 07:49.312
I'm happy for both of you.

07:49.344 --> 07:51.180
I'm a blessed woman.

07:51.214 --> 07:53.115
When God gave out husbands,
He gave me the best.

07:53.149 --> 07:56.619
Yeah, He did.
Lucas is one of the good guys.

07:56.652 --> 07:59.589
Let's just keep that low 'cause I
have a reputation to keep, okay?

07:59.622 --> 08:01.290
Oh, don't worry,
your secret's safe with me.

08:01.324 --> 08:02.425
Yeah, me too.

08:04.460 --> 08:06.596
- It's our song.
- Sure is.

08:06.629 --> 08:08.431
Okay, I'll let you two
get back at it.

08:08.464 --> 08:10.600
I just wanted to say
congratulations.

08:10.633 --> 08:12.101
Thank you again.
I'll come find you in a bit.

08:12.134 --> 08:13.169
You better.

08:13.836 --> 08:16.005
- Bye, Luke.
- Bye, Brook.

08:19.041 --> 08:22.578
- I finally get to dance my wife.
- That's the plan, baby.

08:24.981 --> 08:27.383
So, I don't know
how to say this,

08:27.416 --> 08:29.886
so I'm just gonna say it.

08:29.919 --> 08:32.221
- Lucas, you son of a bitch.
- Oh, God.

08:32.255 --> 08:34.457
Please tell me that's not Mason.

08:34.490 --> 08:36.158
I'm sorry I can't do that.

08:36.192 --> 08:38.027
I thought you said
you didn't invite him.

08:38.059 --> 08:39.562
- I didn't.
- I don't think he knows that.

08:39.595 --> 08:41.563
I don't think he cares.

08:41.597 --> 08:44.667
Get over here!

08:44.700 --> 08:46.736
Congrats, man!
You're finally getting hitched.

08:46.769 --> 08:48.871
Thanks.

08:48.905 --> 08:51.574
And, Ms. Grace, please tell me
you know how lucky you are.

08:51.607 --> 08:54.243
This guy could have had anyone
he wanted and he chose you.

08:54.277 --> 08:56.279
She chose me.

08:57.880 --> 08:59.582
It's good to see you, Mason.

08:59.615 --> 09:01.651
Sorry I missed
the actual ceremony.

09:01.684 --> 09:04.320
Funny story... there's a chick
back at the airport...

09:04.353 --> 09:07.423
Okay, I think we all
how this story ends.

09:07.456 --> 09:09.892
Yeah, of course you do.
You taught me everything I know.

09:09.926 --> 09:12.828
Oh, Mason, my wedding,
we're at my wedding.

09:12.862 --> 09:15.498
Yeah, okay, you're right.
Sorry, Ms. Grace.

09:16.565 --> 09:18.501
I'm gonna let you boys
get caught up.

09:18.534 --> 09:19.902
Chase, care to dance?

09:19.936 --> 09:22.672
Darling, I thought
you'd never ask.

09:26.742 --> 09:28.711
I need a drink.
You need a drink?

09:28.744 --> 09:30.947
- Uh, I could...
- Let's grab a drink.

09:32.081 --> 09:33.149
Move!

09:42.925 --> 09:45.261
A toast to the man
no one thought

09:45.294 --> 09:47.630
would ever settle down,
settling down.

09:51.968 --> 09:53.369
- Ah!
- Oh.

09:54.136 --> 09:55.304
She's amazing, man.

09:55.338 --> 09:56.906
I gotta be honest,

09:56.939 --> 09:58.240
I don't know how I ever lived
without her.

09:58.274 --> 10:00.377
Oh, I do.

10:00.410 --> 10:02.645
But this is neither the time
or the place to talk about it.

10:02.678 --> 10:04.313
But seriously, bro,
I'm happy for you.

10:04.347 --> 10:06.282
Thanks, man.

10:06.315 --> 10:08.884
Lucas and Grace,
fricking married.

10:15.925 --> 10:18.160
I can't believe
you still remember that.

10:18.194 --> 10:20.663
Remember it?
Hell, I think I still got the scar from it.

10:20.696 --> 10:21.964
Oh...

10:22.798 --> 10:25.134
- Okay. Mm...
- Yep, got stabbed.

10:25.167 --> 10:27.236
And you wonder why
we don't hang out anymore.

10:28.537 --> 10:31.307
What I don't get is
you sleep with her sister,

10:31.340 --> 10:33.109
but I'm the one
that gets stabbed.

10:33.142 --> 10:35.811
What? No, no, I...
you slept with her sister.

10:35.845 --> 10:37.513
You just tried
to blame it on me.

10:37.546 --> 10:40.316
- Oh. That's right.
- Huh.

10:40.349 --> 10:42.318
So, wait, how'd she know
it was me, then?

10:42.351 --> 10:44.854
You sent her a picture
of you and her sister.

10:44.887 --> 10:47.523
- Yeah. What's that prove?
- You were naked.

10:47.556 --> 10:50.359
- So?
- And so was her sister.

10:50.394 --> 10:51.761
- Huh.
- Yeah.

10:51.794 --> 10:53.229
Well, I guess that proves it.

10:54.363 --> 10:55.598
You boys having fun?

10:55.631 --> 10:57.600
Mm, something like that.

10:57.633 --> 10:59.101
Well, I won't interrupt.

10:59.135 --> 11:00.936
Just needed a break
from my parents.

11:00.970 --> 11:03.339
- Oh, is it that bad?
- No, they're fine.

11:03.372 --> 11:05.274
But, I mean,
you know how they are.

11:05.307 --> 11:06.342
I do.

11:07.411 --> 11:08.445
Gentlemen.

11:10.079 --> 11:11.448
Madam.

11:11.481 --> 11:12.516
And where have you been?

11:14.316 --> 11:16.352
I was talking to Grace's
friend Tasha over there.

11:17.753 --> 11:19.822
She's a real sweetheart.

11:19.855 --> 11:21.824
You be good, Chase.

11:21.857 --> 11:23.059
Always, darling.

11:24.193 --> 11:26.796
I'll let you boys
get back to it.

11:26.829 --> 11:28.898
I'm gonna make one more trip around,
then I'm getting out of this dress.

11:28.931 --> 11:30.566
Whoa, I thought I was the one

11:30.599 --> 11:32.735
that got to get you
out of that dress later.

11:32.768 --> 11:35.004
You'll be getting me out of whatever
I'm wearing, don't you worry.

11:35.037 --> 11:36.872
Mmm...

11:36.906 --> 11:39.375
- Don't drink too much, okay?
- Mm.

11:39.409 --> 11:41.844
Don't worry Grace,
I'll take care of him.

11:41.877 --> 11:43.413
That's what I'm afraid of.

11:48.617 --> 11:53.322
So I'm almost afraid to ask
'cause... anyone seen Terry?

12:14.411 --> 12:15.778
I found him.

12:25.321 --> 12:28.124
Mason, thanks for showing
my husband a good time,

12:28.157 --> 12:29.593
but I think this is
where we say good night.

12:31.327 --> 12:34.630
I get it.
Time to consummate the marriage.

12:34.663 --> 12:37.434
Good night, Mason.

12:37.467 --> 12:39.436
Good night, Grace.

12:39.469 --> 12:41.637
- Mason!
- Yo.

12:41.670 --> 12:43.906
Cool seeing you tonight.

12:43.939 --> 12:46.942
Maybe I'll catch you
before you hop on the plane?

12:46.976 --> 12:49.812
Might need some alone time
with my wife.

12:49.845 --> 12:51.914
I love when you call me your wife.

12:51.947 --> 12:55.552
Yeah, we got
some baby-making to do.

12:55.585 --> 12:57.720
And you ruined it.

12:57.753 --> 12:59.623
Good night, Mason. Stay safe.

12:59.655 --> 13:02.057
I always am. No kids yet.

13:02.091 --> 13:05.094
It's not what I meant.

13:05.127 --> 13:07.229
What do you think you're doing?

13:07.263 --> 13:08.964
I'm driving.

13:08.998 --> 13:10.933
- You're not driving.
- It's my car.

13:10.966 --> 13:12.001
And you're drunk.

13:12.868 --> 13:14.837
I'm not that drunk.

13:14.870 --> 13:17.339
You're "I hate the ending
of <i>Game of Thrones</i>" drunk.

13:17.373 --> 13:19.576
Yeah, but at least he's not "I
can't believe the Ultimate Warrior

13:19.609 --> 13:22.077
beat Hulk Hogan
in WrestleMania VI" drunk.

13:22.111 --> 13:23.613
- Ugh!
- She got that going for it.

13:23.647 --> 13:25.748
Crap! That was crap!

13:25.781 --> 13:27.651
Oh, man, Ultimate Warrior!
Whoo!

13:27.683 --> 13:29.952
All right, babe,
you know what?

13:29.985 --> 13:33.122
You might be right.
You'll get us home faster.

13:33.155 --> 13:34.624
In a hurry to get home?

13:34.658 --> 13:35.858
You have no idea.

13:37.793 --> 13:39.596
That's my boy!

13:54.544 --> 13:56.078
This is married sex!

14:27.943 --> 14:30.580
Good morning, my beautiful wife.

14:30.614 --> 14:32.815
Good morning,
my adorable husband.

14:32.848 --> 14:34.750
- Mm.
- How'd you sleep?

14:34.783 --> 14:37.786
Great, and I'm even better now.

14:38.787 --> 14:39.989
Why is that?

14:41.257 --> 14:44.661
Because I get to wake up
next to you every morning

14:44.694 --> 14:46.429
for the rest of my life.

14:48.063 --> 14:50.833
I don't know
how I got so lucky,

14:50.866 --> 14:53.002
but I'm gonna thank God
every day that I did.

14:53.035 --> 14:56.171
Oh. I love you, Grace.

14:56.205 --> 14:57.474
I love you, Lucas.

15:03.647 --> 15:05.814
Babe, what's wrong?

15:07.249 --> 15:09.952
I just remembered we have to
meet my parents for breakfast.

15:09.985 --> 15:12.788
Oh, I forgot about that.

15:12.821 --> 15:16.859
Remind me again why we agreed to meet
with them the morning after our wedding.

15:16.892 --> 15:20.229
Uh, we... we didn't agree
to anything.

15:20.262 --> 15:23.633
You agreed,
and I got roped into this

15:23.667 --> 15:26.403
because of some new husband
clause or something.

15:26.436 --> 15:29.805
New? You make it sound
like I've had more than one.

15:29.838 --> 15:32.575
Well, you know there was
that tiny little guy, Benny,

15:32.609 --> 15:35.077
that chased you around,
nipping at your heels.

15:35.110 --> 15:37.414
- That was pretty serious.
- Oh!

15:37.447 --> 15:39.982
Are we forgetting how serious
you and Brooklyn were?

15:40.015 --> 15:44.754
Hmm. Hmm.

15:44.788 --> 15:46.589
Now what?

15:46.623 --> 15:47.657
Hi, Mom.

15:49.024 --> 15:50.794
Yep, 11:00, I know.
We'll be there.

15:52.495 --> 15:54.464
He didn't have
that much to drink, Mom.

15:54.497 --> 15:56.031
Begins already.

15:58.934 --> 16:01.136
Okay, okay,
we'll see you soon.

16:02.672 --> 16:04.708
Yeah, 11:00, I know.
You just told me.

16:07.444 --> 16:10.012
Okay, all right.

16:10.714 --> 16:13.248
See you soon. Bye.

16:14.818 --> 16:17.454
So in case you didn't know,
we're meeting my parents at 11:00.

16:17.487 --> 16:20.255
11:00? Wow, shocker!

16:21.491 --> 16:23.125
I'm gonna go for a jog
while you shower, okay?

16:23.158 --> 16:25.829
Why don't
we shower together?

16:25.894 --> 16:28.130
Honey, I may not
know everything,

16:28.163 --> 16:30.533
but one thing I do know is if
we get in that shower together,

16:30.567 --> 16:33.302
there's no way we're meeting
my parents at 11:00.

16:33.335 --> 16:35.438
And explain to me again
why that's a bad thing.

16:35.472 --> 16:37.474
Shower now.

16:37.507 --> 16:39.509
You now.

16:47.584 --> 16:51.554
Something tells me
we're not gonna make

16:51.588 --> 16:53.690
that lunch at 11:00.

16:53.723 --> 16:55.792
Something tells me
it'll be worth it.

17:14.209 --> 17:16.546
- Good morning.
- Morning. How's it going?

17:22.385 --> 17:26.188
I'm ready.
Can't say the same for you.

17:26.221 --> 17:27.824
Only because
you showered first.

17:29.626 --> 17:31.360
It's okay, I'll wait for you.

17:31.394 --> 17:33.763
Oh really? How nice of you.

17:33.797 --> 17:35.632
I would wait a lifetime for you.

17:41.303 --> 17:42.739
Babe, you okay?

17:44.407 --> 17:46.910
Yeah, I just got this sharp pain
in my head all of a sudden.

17:48.110 --> 17:52.615
Lucas,
something's wrong.

17:52.649 --> 17:54.417
Grace? Grace!

17:58.922 --> 18:00.590
Grace!

18:00.623 --> 18:02.157
No, baby! Honey!

18:02.958 --> 18:05.795
Grace? Grace!

18:05.829 --> 18:08.230
Stay with me, baby.

18:08.832 --> 18:11.568
Baby, wake up! Wake up!

18:11.601 --> 18:13.403
Grace!

18:13.436 --> 18:16.739
Somebody help me! Help!

18:16.773 --> 18:18.974
Grace. No.

18:22.579 --> 18:23.613
Grace!

18:27.182 --> 18:28.551
Please, God.

21:36.271 --> 21:38.641
Everything is going to be okay.

21:40.710 --> 21:41.744
Excuse me?

21:43.780 --> 21:46.348
Everything is going to be okay.

22:06.636 --> 22:07.937
Who was that?

22:07.970 --> 22:09.172
No idea.

22:10.873 --> 22:12.175
How you doing?

22:14.911 --> 22:17.547
My beautiful, vibrant wife

22:17.580 --> 22:19.982
just suddenly died
from a brain aneurysm.

22:20.016 --> 22:21.551
How do you think?

22:21.584 --> 22:23.820
Sorry, stupid question.

22:23.853 --> 22:25.655
Why are you here, Mason?

22:25.688 --> 22:27.190
'Cause, I'm your best friend.

22:29.025 --> 22:30.793
I might not be able
to make you feel any better,

22:30.827 --> 22:32.195
but I'm still gonna try.

22:35.665 --> 22:39.635
I just keep hoping
it's a bad dream...

22:41.170 --> 22:44.040
that I'm gonna wake up and...

22:46.109 --> 22:48.211
she's gonna be right next to me
where she belongs.

22:50.546 --> 22:51.681
I know, buddy.

22:52.949 --> 22:56.552
You know, the world ain't
all sunshine and rainbows.

22:58.020 --> 22:59.722
Did you seriously
just quote <i>Rocky</i> ?

23:00.757 --> 23:01.791
Sorry.

23:04.727 --> 23:08.064
Look, man, you can be
depressed tomorrow,

23:08.097 --> 23:12.068
but today you gotta go on there
and talk to Grace's parents,

23:12.101 --> 23:13.536
talk to her friends.

23:13.569 --> 23:15.138
You gotta be her husband.

23:16.606 --> 23:18.241
Does this even matter
at this point?

23:19.976 --> 23:21.244
What do you think
Grace would want?

23:23.412 --> 23:28.316
Mason, I'm literally about
to bury her in the ground.

23:29.552 --> 23:32.188
How would I possibly know
what she wants?

23:32.221 --> 23:34.791
Look, we both know
I don't believe in this crap...

23:37.560 --> 23:39.529
but you believe
she's up in heaven, right?

23:39.562 --> 23:40.596
That's just it.

23:42.330 --> 23:43.499
For me to believe in heaven,

23:44.667 --> 23:46.903
would mean I would have
to believe in a God

23:46.936 --> 23:48.271
that would kill my wife.

23:50.573 --> 23:52.475
So, the heavenly kid
doesn't believe in heaven.

23:53.176 --> 23:54.811
I'm not sure I do anymore.

23:56.612 --> 23:59.282
That's the funny thing
about you Christians.

23:59.314 --> 24:01.384
Y'all believe in God
when everything is good

24:01.417 --> 24:02.785
and there's nothing going wrong.

24:04.153 --> 24:06.589
And the minute
something bad happens,

24:06.622 --> 24:08.391
you start questioning
everything.

24:08.424 --> 24:10.726
Says the non-believer.

24:11.994 --> 24:13.029
Yeah, that's right.

24:13.963 --> 24:16.299
In my opinion,
there's no old man in the sky.

24:17.700 --> 24:19.902
But I know you believe
Grace is up there

24:19.936 --> 24:21.037
looking down on you.

24:22.805 --> 24:24.740
And I promise you,

24:24.774 --> 24:26.409
she is not happy
with you sitting out here

24:26.442 --> 24:27.977
feeling sorry for yourself.

24:30.546 --> 24:32.014
You're probably right.

24:32.048 --> 24:33.382
Yeah, I know.

25:00.243 --> 25:01.611
Lucas.

25:01.644 --> 25:03.012
Hey, Jackie.

25:06.582 --> 25:07.850
How are you holding up?

25:08.651 --> 25:09.785
I've been better.

25:10.887 --> 25:12.388
How about you?

25:12.421 --> 25:13.556
About the same.

25:14.991 --> 25:16.359
I'm really gonna miss Grace.

25:18.060 --> 25:19.929
Yeah, me too.

25:21.097 --> 25:23.366
It doesn't even
seem real, you know?

25:24.400 --> 25:25.868
I wish it wasn't real.

25:27.236 --> 25:28.771
I think I'll give
you two a minute.

25:32.174 --> 25:36.245
Do you wanna go somewhere
quiet, so we could talk?

25:36.279 --> 25:40.583
Oh, I'd love to, but I should
probably hang around here.

25:41.517 --> 25:44.086
I know.

25:44.120 --> 25:46.789
I just don't wanna break down
in front of all of these people.

25:50.927 --> 25:52.561
You know what? Uh...

25:52.595 --> 25:54.330
Come on, come on.

26:00.970 --> 26:02.305
Okay.

26:04.740 --> 26:05.775
All right.

26:07.411 --> 26:08.444
I think we're alone.

26:10.046 --> 26:11.415
Jackie, what are you doing?

26:12.448 --> 26:14.083
Jackie!

26:14.116 --> 26:16.852
- What?
- What do you mean, "What?"

26:16.886 --> 26:18.422
You don't like what you see?

26:20.456 --> 26:22.925
Jackie, what has
gotten into you?

26:23.659 --> 26:25.928
Luke, Grace is dead.

26:31.435 --> 26:33.602
Luke, wait!

26:33.636 --> 26:35.037
No one has to know.

26:47.350 --> 26:48.851
Hey, what happened.

26:49.585 --> 26:50.886
Where's the chick?

27:10.639 --> 27:13.576
Lucas, what are you doing
out here?

27:13.609 --> 27:15.978
I just, uh, needed
some fresh air.

27:16.612 --> 27:17.913
I'll see you inside, okay?

27:18.614 --> 27:20.916
Hey, I'm...
I'm really sorry, Luke.

27:20.950 --> 27:22.551
I hope you know
that I'm here for you.

27:24.153 --> 27:25.389
I do.

27:26.889 --> 27:27.923
Hey, Luke.

27:29.558 --> 27:31.428
It's okay to not be okay.

27:44.907 --> 27:46.242
I'm so sorry.

27:47.209 --> 27:48.544
I'm so sorry.

28:43.467 --> 28:45.801
What are you doing,
brother?

28:47.036 --> 28:48.671
Watching the game,
drinking a beer.

28:50.540 --> 28:52.608
Well, it looks like
you're wasting your life away.

28:52.641 --> 28:55.412
Yeah, well, looks can be
deceiving.

28:56.612 --> 28:58.448
You can't keep doing this
to yourself.

29:00.216 --> 29:02.051
And why is that, Chase?

29:02.084 --> 29:05.121
Because you're hurting
your family, your friends.

29:06.389 --> 29:07.591
This isn't you.

29:08.791 --> 29:09.825
People change.

29:10.993 --> 29:12.027
Not like this.

29:13.597 --> 29:15.599
Maybe exactly like this.

29:18.734 --> 29:23.473
Luke, when my wife left me,

29:23.507 --> 29:25.274
I felt like a penny
waiting for change.

29:26.476 --> 29:29.912
Your wife left you,
my wife died.

29:29.945 --> 29:32.348
I'm not saying
it's the exact same.

29:35.684 --> 29:37.319
All right...

29:38.821 --> 29:40.624
how did you get over your wife?

29:42.825 --> 29:43.859
I never did.

29:46.128 --> 29:47.631
She was my whole world.

29:48.964 --> 29:50.232
She took my dog.

29:52.268 --> 29:53.302
She took your dog?

29:53.335 --> 29:54.638
She took the damn dog.

29:59.775 --> 30:00.809
I miss that dog.

30:03.279 --> 30:05.214
Chase... and don't take
this the wrong way...

30:06.315 --> 30:09.752
I know you came over here
to make me feel better.

30:09.785 --> 30:11.754
I gotta be honest,
man, you suck at this.

30:11.787 --> 30:14.658
Aw, who am I kidding?

30:16.158 --> 30:18.794
Maybe I'm not the one
to help you through this.

30:18.827 --> 30:20.863
All I know is
the best way to get over someone

30:20.896 --> 30:23.199
is to get under someone else.

30:23.232 --> 30:24.867
Mason.

30:24.900 --> 30:26.702
What are you doing here?

30:26.735 --> 30:28.505
You guys surprised to see me?

30:28.538 --> 30:30.139
Well, yeah.

30:30.172 --> 30:32.975
I mean, you've been gone
for over a year,

30:33.008 --> 30:34.678
so I'd say so.

30:36.345 --> 30:37.780
When did you get back?

30:37.813 --> 30:39.416
Just now, came right here.

30:41.250 --> 30:44.688
That's great.
Um, what do you want, Mason?

30:44.720 --> 30:46.755
I'm here to help you
get your life back together.

30:47.323 --> 30:49.191
My life?

30:49.225 --> 30:52.529
Yeah, it's dead,
buried in the ground.

30:53.697 --> 30:55.130
No, that's your wife.

30:58.000 --> 30:59.034
Same difference.

31:01.737 --> 31:02.771
You know what?

31:04.840 --> 31:05.975
I'm gonna head outside
for a smoke.

31:07.577 --> 31:09.111
I'll give you boys
a minute to talk.

31:20.055 --> 31:22.925
What are you really
doing here, Mason?

31:22.958 --> 31:25.729
Lucas, I know
how much you love Grace.

31:25.761 --> 31:29.131
It's like one of those
Nicholas Sparks books.

31:30.132 --> 31:31.934
Nicholas Sparks?

31:31.967 --> 31:34.003
Yeah, like one
of those chick flicks.

31:34.036 --> 31:35.672
I know you loved her,
but she's gone.

31:37.273 --> 31:39.341
Tell me something
I don't know.

31:39.375 --> 31:40.410
You're not gone.

31:41.611 --> 31:43.779
You got plenty of life
left to live.

31:43.812 --> 31:47.082
I wake up every morning,
go to work, pay my bills.

31:47.983 --> 31:49.785
What else do I need to be doing?

31:51.086 --> 31:53.757
- You need to learn to live without Grace.
- Hmm.

31:57.560 --> 31:59.396
Ah! No, thanks.

31:59.429 --> 32:00.996
Everything's fine the way it is.

32:02.432 --> 32:03.466
This isn't you.

32:04.166 --> 32:06.235
This has never been you.

32:06.268 --> 32:08.471
You know, I'm getting
really sick and tired

32:08.505 --> 32:10.873
of people telling me
what isn't me.

32:10.906 --> 32:12.007
What is me, Mason?

32:13.309 --> 32:15.244
Is it the guy that goes
partying every night?

32:15.277 --> 32:17.480
How about the guy that goes out

32:17.514 --> 32:19.582
and gets laid by a different
chick every night of the week?

32:19.616 --> 32:21.718
You know what?
I'll spare you the suspense.

32:21.751 --> 32:24.721
That's not me anymore and it
hasn't been in a long time, so...

32:24.754 --> 32:28.257
I know that's not you,
not anymore.

32:28.290 --> 32:31.160
You're the guy who falls
in love with a great woman

32:31.193 --> 32:32.227
and gets married.

32:34.631 --> 32:37.933
Been there, done that,
didn't like how it ended.

32:37.966 --> 32:40.903
You're the guy who never gives
up, no matter how hard it gets.

32:40.936 --> 32:42.004
That's you, Lucas.

32:45.274 --> 32:47.209
Maybe this is me.

32:48.310 --> 32:50.012
You might want this to be you,

32:50.045 --> 32:52.114
but I'm not gonna
let that happen.

32:52.147 --> 32:54.116
Oh, you're not gonna
let that happen?

32:54.149 --> 32:57.319
Okay, so you're gonna just
swoop in and save the day?

32:57.353 --> 32:59.955
Yeah, maybe I will.

33:00.790 --> 33:03.025
And, uh, how are you
gonna do that?

33:06.563 --> 33:09.833
You got a date, Friday night.

33:11.967 --> 33:13.936
- Are you stupid?
- What?

33:13.969 --> 33:15.772
- I'm married!
- No, you're not.

33:15.805 --> 33:17.339
It's been a year.
It's time to move on.

33:19.007 --> 33:22.445
No! No, no, no, hell, no.
Mm-mm.

33:22.479 --> 33:25.080
Come on, man,
it's just one date.

33:26.348 --> 33:27.983
I'm not asking you to marry her.

33:28.016 --> 33:29.318
You need to get out
and test the waters.

33:29.351 --> 33:32.221
Dude, not happening.
Forget it.

33:32.254 --> 33:33.556
You need to do this.

33:36.925 --> 33:38.127
So, let me get this straight.

33:38.160 --> 33:40.195
You've been gone for a year.

33:40.229 --> 33:42.364
You just pop back in,
and all of a sudden

33:42.399 --> 33:43.867
you know what I need in my life?

33:46.703 --> 33:47.737
Let me ask you this.

33:48.937 --> 33:51.907
If Grace were here,
what would she want?

33:51.940 --> 33:54.477
Grace isn't here.

33:54.511 --> 33:55.545
Exactly.

35:21.664 --> 35:23.800
Obviously, you're gonna be
a little rusty tonight,

35:23.833 --> 35:26.469
so let's go over a few basics.

35:26.503 --> 35:28.438
Let's not.

35:28.471 --> 35:30.239
You know you can't bring up
Grace tonight, right?

35:31.508 --> 35:32.675
Can we not do this?

35:32.709 --> 35:34.444
I'm just saying,

35:34.477 --> 35:36.479
you haven't been on a date
in a long time.

35:37.514 --> 35:40.984
Don't worry,
I got it covered, hmm?

35:42.452 --> 35:44.387
I know I've been busting
your balls, but...

35:47.457 --> 35:48.525
I'm gonna be serious
for a minute.

35:50.960 --> 35:53.028
- Don't hurt yourself.
- Very funny.

35:55.965 --> 35:57.934
You remember when we
used to play video games?

35:59.134 --> 36:01.504
Do you mean when we were kids?

36:01.538 --> 36:03.006
Yeah, I guess.

36:03.038 --> 36:05.408
Good, so you remember me
beating you

36:05.441 --> 36:07.443
in <i>Street Fighter II</i>, right?

36:07.477 --> 36:09.012
- You didn't beat me.
- Yeah, I did.

36:09.044 --> 36:10.847
No, you didn't.

36:10.880 --> 36:12.782
The point is I used to beat you
all the time

36:12.815 --> 36:15.518
and you'd get all mad and cry,
and so we had to start over.

36:15.552 --> 36:17.020
I didn't cry.

36:17.052 --> 36:18.153
Then why did we call you
"cry-baby"?

36:18.186 --> 36:20.456
Because I liked that movie.

36:20.490 --> 36:23.893
Yeah,
keep telling yourself that.

36:24.861 --> 36:27.497
Okay, so this is
you being serious?

36:27.530 --> 36:30.533
Look, I know life
isn't a video game,

36:30.567 --> 36:32.702
but this is your chance
to hit the reset button.

36:33.870 --> 36:35.370
You make it sound so simple.

36:40.677 --> 36:41.711
Just one thing.

36:43.513 --> 36:44.547
What?

36:45.815 --> 36:47.282
You should probably
take off your wedding ring.

36:49.886 --> 36:53.255
Mason, I...

36:53.288 --> 36:54.323
I know. Believe me, I know.

36:56.025 --> 37:00.329
Just take it off for the date
and put it in your pocket.

37:00.362 --> 37:01.864
Put it on a necklace,
I really don't care.

37:01.898 --> 37:05.267
Just don't wear it
on your finger.

37:05.300 --> 37:07.570
I didn't even wanna
go on this date.

37:07.604 --> 37:09.539
You can put it back on the
minute the date's over, okay?

37:09.572 --> 37:10.607
Trust me on this one.

37:15.778 --> 37:19.616
Look, man, I... I get it, okay?

37:19.649 --> 37:23.686
And I know it's been
over a year, but...

37:28.057 --> 37:29.993
I'm not sure I'm ready for this.

37:31.561 --> 37:33.096
I guess we'll find out,
won't we?

37:41.904 --> 37:43.106
Lucas?

37:43.806 --> 37:44.841
Carla.

37:45.908 --> 37:46.943
That's me.

37:48.611 --> 37:49.779
It's nice to meet you.

37:49.812 --> 37:51.047
You as well.

37:55.183 --> 37:58.320
So, have you ever
been here before?

37:58.353 --> 38:01.958
Oh, no, but I've heard
really good things about it.

38:01.991 --> 38:05.128
Yeah, it kind of has
a cool vibe to it.

38:05.160 --> 38:06.896
Yeah, it does.

38:06.929 --> 38:07.964
Yes, it does.

38:15.672 --> 38:18.173
I don't care, I like the shrimp.

38:18.206 --> 38:22.177
You ordered last time.
It's my turn. I want the shrimp.

38:33.122 --> 38:34.991
I think you should get
whatever you want.

38:37.192 --> 38:38.226
Thank you.

38:41.130 --> 38:43.166
Hello, I'm Brian.
I'll be your server tonight.

38:43.198 --> 38:45.034
Can I get you two started
with something to drink?

38:45.068 --> 38:46.436
Oh, water is fine.

38:46.469 --> 38:47.503
Yes, it is.

38:50.473 --> 38:52.175
Water, yeah, that's, uh...
that's great.

38:54.209 --> 38:58.114
Are we ready to order
or do we need a few minutes?

38:58.147 --> 39:00.783
I don't care what he said,
I still want the shrimp.

39:07.523 --> 39:09.792
I think you should
get the shrimp.

39:09.826 --> 39:11.694
I'm sure it's great, right?

39:13.261 --> 39:16.132
Please, don't be rude.

39:17.567 --> 39:19.736
- I'm sorry?
- It's not polite.

39:21.104 --> 39:22.972
I'm gonna give you two
a few minutes.

39:23.005 --> 39:24.239
Yeah.

39:28.611 --> 39:30.213
Did I say something
to offend you?

39:32.081 --> 39:33.816
No, it's fine.

39:36.284 --> 39:38.521
Because I was just saying, like,

39:38.554 --> 39:41.424
you should just get
whatever you want.

39:41.457 --> 39:42.492
Thank you.

39:44.193 --> 39:46.729
I don't care what he said,
I still want the shrimp.

39:52.468 --> 39:53.569
You're kidding, right?

39:54.871 --> 39:57.006
Kidding you about what?

39:57.039 --> 39:59.108
This is a joke.

39:59.142 --> 40:01.343
Mason... Mason put you
up to this, didn't he?

40:01.376 --> 40:03.079
God. That Mason.

40:03.112 --> 40:04.614
Come out, Mason.

40:04.647 --> 40:07.517
Ha ha, really funny.
Joke's over.

40:07.550 --> 40:09.185
That's... This is good.
That's good.

40:10.119 --> 40:11.587
This isn't a joke.

40:17.059 --> 40:18.194
Oh...

40:20.630 --> 40:24.734
Sorry, I just assumed
this was a joke.

40:24.767 --> 40:28.538
I mean, one minute
you're talking to me,

40:28.571 --> 40:30.372
and then the next,
you're talking

40:30.406 --> 40:34.911
to what I can only assume
is an imaginary friend.

40:34.944 --> 40:38.948
I don't have
an imaginary friend.

40:38.981 --> 40:41.150
- Oh.
- Oh, my goodness.

40:41.184 --> 40:43.119
Yeah, I know. Rude much?

40:44.520 --> 40:45.555
Right there.

40:46.489 --> 40:48.090
What is your problem?

40:48.124 --> 40:51.394
Um, I'm not the one
with the problem.

40:51.427 --> 40:52.995
Really?

40:54.030 --> 40:57.500
'Cause you definitely seem
like you have a problem.

40:57.533 --> 41:00.136
Yeah, yeah, he definitely does.

41:01.537 --> 41:04.407
See, there! There it is again.

41:04.440 --> 41:06.008
Why are you being so mean?

41:06.042 --> 41:07.743
I'm not trying to be mean,

41:07.777 --> 41:10.680
but, I mean,
you're acting kind of crazy.

41:10.713 --> 41:15.685
Oh!

41:15.718 --> 41:21.991
Please, please, please,
don't call me crazy.

41:26.162 --> 41:28.598
What am I supposed
to call you when...

41:28.631 --> 41:31.968
You can call me by my name.
Mm-hmm.

41:32.001 --> 41:33.069
Okay.

41:34.670 --> 41:36.772
I'm sorry, I'm not
trying to be mean.

41:36.806 --> 41:39.976
It's just that, again,
one minute you're talking to me,

41:40.009 --> 41:43.446
and the next,
you're talking to whatever.

41:43.479 --> 41:45.715
I mean, it's a little crazy.

41:46.849 --> 41:50.353
I asked you not
to call me crazy!

41:52.488 --> 41:55.858
I hate when guys call me crazy!

41:59.262 --> 42:01.664
Carla, please relax.

42:01.697 --> 42:04.867
I may have gone too far.
I'm sorry.

42:06.035 --> 42:08.237
So... for... for what? What?

42:08.271 --> 42:10.006
Sorry for what?

42:10.039 --> 42:11.374
I know. I'm not crazy.

42:12.408 --> 42:14.410
I'm sorry if I offended you?

42:15.177 --> 42:16.979
Oh, offended me?

42:21.050 --> 42:25.254
You mean, for calling me crazy?

42:25.288 --> 42:28.824
Why would I be offended?
I mean, I'm not crazy.

42:28.858 --> 42:29.892
I'm not crazy.

42:31.694 --> 42:35.231
If I'm being honest,
you are acting a little crazy right now.

42:35.264 --> 42:39.235
Stop calling me crazy!

42:42.271 --> 42:43.306
I'm out.

42:46.642 --> 42:48.110
- You're leaving?
- Yup!

42:56.919 --> 43:00.690
Thanks for ruining our date.
You did ruin it.

43:00.723 --> 43:02.426
I didn't do anything.

43:04.627 --> 43:05.661
Whatever.

43:08.631 --> 43:10.466
Can I help you with anything?

43:10.499 --> 43:12.436
I'd like the shrimp.

43:16.672 --> 43:19.041
- Jeez.
- Oh, man.

43:20.676 --> 43:22.511
So, let me get this straight.

43:24.280 --> 43:26.549
You set Luke up with
someone who heard voices.

43:28.517 --> 43:30.454
Okay, I guess
it's time to come clean.

43:32.488 --> 43:35.925
Wait, are you serious?
You knew she heard voices?

43:35.958 --> 43:37.960
No, I didn't know
she heard voices.

43:37.994 --> 43:40.129
And I also didn't set you up
on the date.

43:40.162 --> 43:41.931
Wait, what?

43:41.964 --> 43:44.300
I did, and you're welcome, bro.

43:46.936 --> 43:48.904
- Are you kidding me?
- No.

43:48.938 --> 43:51.741
What? There's nothing
wrong with Carla.

43:51.774 --> 43:54.110
Yeah, she's a peach,

43:54.143 --> 43:57.179
you know, besides the fact
that she hears voices.

43:57.213 --> 44:01.117
Okay, I admit
she's a little crazy.

44:01.150 --> 44:02.685
A little crazy?

44:02.718 --> 44:04.687
Your boy set you up with someone

44:04.720 --> 44:06.922
who's two cans
short of a six-pack.

44:06.956 --> 44:09.525
- You just didn't give her a chance.
- Mm.

44:09.558 --> 44:10.760
Shut up, Terry.

44:12.795 --> 44:15.499
So, obviously, the date
didn't go as planned.

44:15.564 --> 44:18.100
I kind of expected it to be bad.

44:18.134 --> 44:20.903
Just not "she belongs
in a straitjacket" bad.

44:22.905 --> 44:24.040
Don't even worry about it.

44:25.674 --> 44:27.843
I already got you set up
on a second date.

44:27.877 --> 44:30.212
Yeah, there is no way
I'm going on another date

44:30.246 --> 44:31.680
with that woman.

44:31.714 --> 44:33.517
Not with her, someone else.

44:35.419 --> 44:37.387
I didn't even wanna
go on the first date.

44:37.421 --> 44:39.622
What would make you think
I'd want to go on another one?

44:39.655 --> 44:40.689
But your last date went so well.

44:42.191 --> 44:45.661
- Yeah, no more dates.
- Yeah, you are.

44:45.694 --> 44:47.630
Trust me, you'll like this one.

44:47.663 --> 44:50.132
Yeah, you'll like her...
till she starts talking to herself.

44:50.166 --> 44:53.669
Okay, forget about crazy Carla.

44:53.702 --> 44:56.406
This is a good girl.
You'll really like her.

44:56.440 --> 44:59.443
Nice, sweet, good-looking girl.
Trust me.

45:02.379 --> 45:04.213
Did you have a hand
in setting this one up too?

45:04.246 --> 45:07.417
Oh, my God, there is
nothing wrong with Carla.

45:07.451 --> 45:09.251
Your loss man.
I'm gonna call her.

45:12.456 --> 45:15.224
You know, I'm not one
to agree with Mason...

45:16.892 --> 45:18.861
but what have you got
to lose, brother?

45:18.894 --> 45:20.029
My sanity.

45:20.062 --> 45:23.165
So, it's settled.

45:23.199 --> 45:24.300
One more date.

45:26.570 --> 45:28.938
I'm gonna regret this, aren't I?

45:28.971 --> 45:30.906
Probably.

45:30.940 --> 45:32.775
Are you talking
to me now?

45:32.808 --> 45:34.743
Can you please be quiet?

45:34.777 --> 45:38.180
No, not you, you.
The other you!

45:39.483 --> 45:40.517
What?

45:42.618 --> 45:43.686
Match made in heaven.

46:02.271 --> 46:04.407
- Caroline.
- Hi.

46:04.441 --> 46:06.675
- Hi, I'm Lucas.
- Hi.

46:12.314 --> 46:14.216
Thank you again for meeting me
in the afternoon.

46:15.951 --> 46:18.287
I'm sure it's probably earlier
than you were expecting.

46:18.320 --> 46:20.055
Oh, no, it's fine.

46:20.089 --> 46:21.857
Daytime, nighttime,
I'm good with either.

46:23.359 --> 46:24.461
I'm glad to hear that.

46:25.928 --> 46:26.962
If I'm being honest,

46:28.130 --> 46:31.468
meeting in the daytime
works out better for me.

46:31.501 --> 46:34.437
I'm not much of a night owl.

46:34.471 --> 46:35.905
Early bird, huh?

46:35.938 --> 46:37.840
Good afternoon. I'm Liz.

46:37.873 --> 46:39.409
What can I get you guys
to drink?

46:39.442 --> 46:41.444
Oh, I'll have the sweet tea
if you have it.

46:41.478 --> 46:43.112
We sure do.

46:43.145 --> 46:44.914
- And for you?
- Water's fine, thank you.

46:44.947 --> 46:46.483
Great. Be right back.

46:49.985 --> 46:51.987
Do you mind if I ask you
a personal question?

46:54.123 --> 46:56.660
It's a little early
for personal questions, no?

46:58.395 --> 47:00.329
Oh, sorry.

47:02.031 --> 47:04.733
I'm messing with you.
Ask me anything you'd like.

47:07.169 --> 47:11.106
Okay, um, so, I guess
my question would be...

47:13.209 --> 47:15.945
do you accept Jesus Christ
as your Lord and savior?

47:17.012 --> 47:18.714
Oh. Um...

47:20.015 --> 47:22.385
Caroline,
that's a great question,

47:22.419 --> 47:26.690
but I'd prefer if we don't
discuss that right now.

47:28.190 --> 47:30.493
- Okay. Here you go.
- Thank you.

47:30.527 --> 47:31.894
All right,
are we ready to order?

47:31.927 --> 47:34.029
I'm sorry, not yet.

47:34.063 --> 47:35.699
Okay, I'll give you guys
a minute.

47:39.101 --> 47:40.704
So, you don't believe in God?

47:45.007 --> 47:48.811
I, um... I don't really know
how to answer that.

47:48.844 --> 47:50.380
It's a simple question.

47:51.847 --> 47:54.149
You either believe in God
and accept Jesus Christ

47:54.183 --> 47:55.918
as your Lord and savior
or you don't.

47:56.952 --> 47:59.723
It's, um... It's not
as simple as you'd think.

48:03.892 --> 48:06.429
I'm going to be honest
with you, Lucas.

48:08.130 --> 48:10.032
I don't think I can
continue this lunch

48:10.065 --> 48:11.434
if you aren't Christian.

48:15.204 --> 48:19.409
Okay, well, I'm sorry
for wasting your time.

48:20.577 --> 48:21.611
So...

48:22.978 --> 48:24.481
So, you don't believe?

48:29.218 --> 48:31.186
It's not that I don't believe.

48:31.220 --> 48:32.656
It's that I...

48:37.159 --> 48:40.362
I really... I really don't know
what I believe.

48:42.264 --> 48:43.433
What do you mean?

48:50.005 --> 48:52.274
My wife died about a year ago.

48:56.011 --> 48:58.280
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

48:58.314 --> 49:03.453
Yeah, and it was the morning
after our wedding.

49:05.287 --> 49:07.056
I see.

49:07.089 --> 49:09.992
So, you'll forgive me
if I don't just believe

49:10.025 --> 49:12.395
in some higher power

49:12.429 --> 49:14.798
that would let
something like that happen.

49:17.767 --> 49:22.405
Well, you can't let one bad
moment challenge your faith.

49:22.439 --> 49:25.074
Yeah, my wife dying
is a little bit more

49:25.107 --> 49:26.676
than just one bad moment.

49:27.544 --> 49:28.812
That's not how I meant it.

49:29.779 --> 49:31.614
No, that's fine, I get it.

49:31.648 --> 49:34.751
But like I said,
I would just really prefer

49:34.784 --> 49:36.820
not to talk about this
right now.

49:38.655 --> 49:39.922
You have to understand,

49:41.791 --> 49:47.229
faith and God are a very
important part of my life.

49:49.331 --> 49:52.000
Okay, that's great
for you, Caroline,

49:52.034 --> 49:55.104
but this is our first date.

49:55.137 --> 49:59.875
I mean, could we at least
table this till the next one?

49:59.908 --> 50:02.010
If there is a next one.

50:03.078 --> 50:04.947
I'm sorry if I offended you
with the comment

50:04.980 --> 50:06.281
I made about your ex-wife.

50:06.315 --> 50:07.550
My wife.

50:09.017 --> 50:11.821
I'm sure you two had
an amazing relationship,

50:11.855 --> 50:14.691
which is exactly why God gave
you the time with her He did.

50:15.991 --> 50:18.728
Hmm. God gave me
the time with her.

50:18.762 --> 50:21.330
Yeah, God killed my wife.

50:21.363 --> 50:25.802
- That's what God did for me.
- No. No, Lucas.

50:28.337 --> 50:31.508
Your wife served her purpose
here on earth.

50:31.541 --> 50:34.411
God took her back to His kingdom

50:34.444 --> 50:38.247
and now she is happier
than she's ever been.

50:38.280 --> 50:41.049
Happier than she's ever been.

50:41.083 --> 50:42.819
You know what?

50:42.852 --> 50:44.721
You don't know the first thing
about my wife.

50:44.754 --> 50:48.425
I'm sorry if I upset you.
That was never my intention.

50:48.458 --> 50:50.760
You know what?
Don't even worry about it.

50:50.794 --> 50:54.731
The fact is, Caroline,
this was never gonna work, okay?

50:54.764 --> 50:57.600
You and me, we are two
completely different people

50:57.634 --> 51:00.670
with two completely
different sets of beliefs.

51:00.703 --> 51:02.505
I don't understand.

51:02.539 --> 51:04.841
Mason said that
you were religious.

51:04.874 --> 51:08.177
Yeah, well, Mason was wrong.

51:08.210 --> 51:09.446
It's been a pleasure.

51:11.448 --> 51:12.882
I'll pray for you.

51:12.916 --> 51:14.249
Don't.

51:19.154 --> 51:21.190
So, Lucas is gonna
be here, right?

51:21.223 --> 51:22.759
Yeah. Why?
You miss him?

51:22.792 --> 51:25.294
No, he wants to see
how Lucas's date went.

51:25.327 --> 51:27.095
Shut up, Terry.

51:27.129 --> 51:29.031
What? It's true.

51:29.064 --> 51:31.734
You wanna know if he got on
with Sister Caroline.

51:31.768 --> 51:34.369
- She's not a nun, you moron.
- Well, how am I supposed to know?

51:34.404 --> 51:36.238
All I know is
she was drilling him

51:36.271 --> 51:37.774
with all kinds
of Jesus questions.

51:37.807 --> 51:39.809
She did.

51:39.843 --> 51:42.412
Well, he's the one supposed
to be doing the drilling.

51:42.445 --> 51:44.414
Well, at least she didn't
hear voices.

51:44.447 --> 51:46.816
There's nothing wrong
with Carla.

51:48.183 --> 51:49.351
Shut up, Terry.

51:52.755 --> 51:54.223
Blow it up.

51:57.694 --> 52:01.464
What did I miss?

52:01.498 --> 52:02.899
Have a seat, brother.

52:06.201 --> 52:08.003
Chase is dying to know
how your date went.

52:10.707 --> 52:12.976
Stay down there, will you?

52:14.711 --> 52:17.447
I thought
we were here to play poker,

52:17.480 --> 52:19.415
not talk about my bad dates.

52:20.315 --> 52:23.419
- Come on, it wasn't that bad.
- Really?

52:23.453 --> 52:24.921
Were you there
when she was drilling me

52:24.954 --> 52:27.122
20 questions about Jesus?

52:27.155 --> 52:30.025
Okay, but other
than the Jesus talk,

52:30.058 --> 52:31.995
she's a nice girl, right?

52:32.027 --> 52:34.831
Oh, yeah, I especially
liked the part

52:34.864 --> 52:38.001
where she was telling me
that my wife is happier dead

52:38.033 --> 52:40.035
than she was alive with me.

52:40.068 --> 52:41.871
Oh, yeah, she's great.

52:42.705 --> 52:44.007
That's rough.

52:45.408 --> 52:49.846
Yeah, I mean she didn't mean
any harm by it.

52:49.879 --> 52:53.416
I mean, it's not her fault.

52:54.149 --> 52:56.553
Well, I don't blame you,
brother.

52:56.586 --> 52:59.354
Some subjects just aren't meant
to be spoken on the first date.

53:00.857 --> 53:02.926
Yeah, I was kind
of rude, though.

53:03.860 --> 53:05.127
She didn't deserve that.

53:06.361 --> 53:08.330
So, are you gonna give her
a second chance?

53:08.363 --> 53:10.500
No, mm-mm.

53:10.533 --> 53:13.135
She needs someone who
wholeheartedly believes in God,

53:13.937 --> 53:15.103
and that's not me.

53:17.239 --> 53:18.373
That used to be you.

53:19.742 --> 53:21.044
Used to be.

53:25.247 --> 53:26.382
Let's go out.

53:28.718 --> 53:30.386
What?

53:30.420 --> 53:32.589
I'm sick of sitting
around this poker table.

53:32.622 --> 53:35.223
You've been gone for a year.
This is what we do.

53:35.257 --> 53:36.593
It's Friday night poker.

53:37.727 --> 53:40.095
I wouldn't be against a drink.

53:40.128 --> 53:42.164
See?

53:42.197 --> 53:44.434
Yeah, what's this whole
"agreeing with Mason" thing?

53:44.467 --> 53:47.336
I'm not sure
I like that very much.

53:47.369 --> 53:50.272
I'm just saying,
might do you some good.

53:50.305 --> 53:52.341
Let's go out, just the boys.

53:52.374 --> 53:53.876
Like the good old days.

53:53.910 --> 53:55.445
What's the harm in that?

53:55.478 --> 53:57.480
Let's get drunk!

54:00.115 --> 54:01.216
It's up to you, Luke.

54:01.249 --> 54:03.118
We can sit around and play poker

54:03.151 --> 54:05.755
and I'll gladly
take all your money.

54:05.788 --> 54:09.291
Or, if you're up for
a little more excitement,

54:09.324 --> 54:11.961
I say we go out
like the old days and get drunk.

54:11.995 --> 54:13.161
Just completely drunk.

54:16.099 --> 54:18.601
- All right. What the heck? I'm down. Let's do it.
- Yeah!

54:18.635 --> 54:20.403
- Let's get completely drunk.
- What is that?

54:20.436 --> 54:22.405
- Come on, get in.
- No. Get in where?

54:22.438 --> 54:23.773
What are you, 12?

54:23.806 --> 54:25.108
Come on.

54:29.646 --> 54:31.748
Terry, come on,
we're going.

55:08.885 --> 55:11.186
Hey, hey, the boys.

55:11.219 --> 55:13.956
Welcome, welcome.
What can I get you?

55:13.990 --> 55:15.758
Let me get
four shots of Jack.

55:15.792 --> 55:17.160
You got it.

55:18.494 --> 55:20.863
Guys, you'll never
guess who I ran into.

55:20.897 --> 55:22.598
This is Candy.

55:22.632 --> 55:24.801
I met her when I was out
in LA, now here she is.

55:24.834 --> 55:26.636
Hey, everyone.

55:36.879 --> 55:39.115
Hey, Chase, I need to talk
to you for a sec.

55:42.018 --> 55:43.218
Come on, Terry.

55:46.321 --> 55:48.491
Not very subtle. Busy.

55:48.524 --> 55:50.225
That's okay, I don't mind.

55:55.898 --> 55:57.467
I'm Lucas, by the way.

55:57.500 --> 56:00.703
Candy, but you
already know that.

56:07.176 --> 56:09.178
So you're in town from LA.

56:09.212 --> 56:11.647
What brings you back?

56:11.681 --> 56:13.716
I loved LA,
but it just wasn't for me.

56:13.750 --> 56:15.885
I wanna be an actress for sure,

56:15.918 --> 56:19.388
but I'm just not into doing
all those cheap horror films.

56:19.422 --> 56:21.157
Mmm.

56:21.190 --> 56:23.526
Although, some careers
kind of got their break

56:23.559 --> 56:25.094
from horror films.

56:26.863 --> 56:30.365
Johnny Depp, Kevin Bacon.

56:30.399 --> 56:33.970
Yeah, but, like,
they're guys, it's different.

56:35.471 --> 56:37.173
I think Jennifer Aniston

56:37.206 --> 56:39.041
actually got her break
from a horror film.

56:39.075 --> 56:43.012
That's true, but she's, like,
the exception to the rule.

56:43.045 --> 56:46.215
Most of those films just cast
women to show their boobs.

56:46.249 --> 56:48.451
And I'll be honest,

56:48.484 --> 56:51.554
I'm not giving these babies
away for free.

56:51.587 --> 56:53.589
Yeah, no, I, um...

56:53.623 --> 56:56.259
I agree with you
on the horror film thing.

56:57.760 --> 57:00.263
I guess at the end of the day

57:00.295 --> 57:01.931
if you really want
something bad enough,

57:01.964 --> 57:03.900
you just gotta put the work in.

57:03.933 --> 57:09.005
That's such
an old-school way of thinking.

57:10.305 --> 57:12.208
Why would you say that?

57:12.241 --> 57:15.478
Uh, all you have to do
is go viral.

57:15.511 --> 57:17.312
Well, sure, if you want
your 15 minutes,

57:17.345 --> 57:19.282
and then nobody remembers you.

57:20.583 --> 57:22.084
But don't you want
to be someone

57:22.118 --> 57:24.220
that people always remember?

57:24.253 --> 57:26.222
Like Kim Kardashian!

57:28.124 --> 57:30.827
Now exactly what I had
in mind, but, sure.

57:30.860 --> 57:35.565
Yo, Candy cane! There you is!

57:36.632 --> 57:38.501
Oh, Razor!

57:38.534 --> 57:42.171
Lucas, I want you to
meet my best friend, Razor.

57:42.205 --> 57:44.507
Hi. Nice to meet you, Razor.

57:44.540 --> 57:47.977
Just Brad, but everybody
call me Razor.

57:48.010 --> 57:51.981
Razor, you will never
guess who I ran into.

57:52.014 --> 57:54.183
- Who?
- Mason.

57:55.451 --> 57:57.987
- "Mason from LA" Mason?
- That's the one.

57:58.020 --> 57:59.322
Yo, where he at?

58:00.957 --> 58:02.592
You know Mason too?

58:02.625 --> 58:04.994
Oh, yeah, I know Mason.

58:05.027 --> 58:06.596
That's my boy.

58:06.629 --> 58:09.364
I don't see him.

58:09.398 --> 58:14.237
Candy, are you down
to go find Mason for me, hmm?

58:15.571 --> 58:19.008
- Sure thing, Razor.
- I'll keep your boy company.

58:19.041 --> 58:20.543
I'll be right back.

58:20.576 --> 58:22.578
Don't go anywhere, okay?

58:24.213 --> 58:26.449
I'll be right here.

58:26.482 --> 58:29.552
- Whoa!
- Oh, I'm okay.

58:31.821 --> 58:33.389
She'll need Life Alert.

58:33.422 --> 58:36.025
Can I get you guys anything?

58:36.058 --> 58:37.226
Beer is fine.

58:37.260 --> 58:38.995
Great. And for you?

58:39.028 --> 58:40.196
I'm undecided.

58:41.063 --> 58:43.366
Right. Right.

58:45.167 --> 58:49.805
So, Lucas,

58:49.839 --> 58:52.241
what's the deal
with you and my girl Candy?

58:52.275 --> 58:54.243
Oh, there's no deal, man.

58:55.378 --> 58:56.879
Just met her.

58:56.913 --> 58:58.414
So you ain't
interested at her?

59:00.082 --> 59:03.387
No, she's not really my type.

59:04.453 --> 59:05.788
Really?

59:07.123 --> 59:08.357
And here's your beer.

59:08.392 --> 59:10.026
Thank you.

59:10.059 --> 59:11.627
So let me ask you this.

59:12.728 --> 59:14.530
If you ain't interested
in my girl Candy,

59:15.531 --> 59:17.667
what do you say
you and me get out of here?

59:20.603 --> 59:21.904
Sorry about that.

59:21.938 --> 59:23.940
Um...

59:23.973 --> 59:27.910
Um... the reason
I'm not interested in Candy

59:27.944 --> 59:29.779
isn't because she's a female.

59:29.812 --> 59:33.616
I like women. I'm not gay.

59:33.649 --> 59:35.484
Gay? Whoa.

59:36.252 --> 59:37.820
Who's talking about being gay?

59:39.288 --> 59:41.324
- Oh, I just...
- I ain't gay.

59:42.258 --> 59:44.627
I mean, it's obvious
that you ain't interested

59:44.660 --> 59:47.697
in my girl Candy,
but I'm sorry, I ain't gay.

59:48.664 --> 59:50.499
- I apologize.
- Relax.

59:52.268 --> 59:53.437
It's all good.

59:54.937 --> 59:57.773
I mean,
unless you're interested.

01:00:00.676 --> 01:00:03.679
- So you are gay?
- Are you?

01:00:04.448 --> 01:00:06.182
- No.
- Me either.

01:00:08.684 --> 01:00:11.287
So, you're not gay.

01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:13.556
Nope, not unless you are.

01:00:13.589 --> 01:00:14.557
I'm not.

01:00:14.590 --> 01:00:16.692
Great, neither am I.

01:00:22.999 --> 01:00:24.066
You know what?

01:00:24.100 --> 01:00:25.768
Early morning tomorrow.

01:00:25.801 --> 01:00:28.704
Could you just tell Candy
I had to leave?

01:00:30.373 --> 01:00:32.476
You know, if you
change your mind,

01:00:32.508 --> 01:00:34.411
you know where to find me.

01:00:35.378 --> 01:00:39.215
I won't, but... thank you.

01:00:42.218 --> 01:00:43.953
Mm, mm, mm!

01:00:43.986 --> 01:00:46.922
- Hey, buddy.
- What?

01:00:48.657 --> 01:00:51.694
- So, are you gay or what?
- What?

01:00:51.727 --> 01:00:53.729
No, I ain't gay.

01:00:54.797 --> 01:00:55.898
Why? Are you?

01:00:56.665 --> 01:00:59.503
No, man. No, I'm not gay.

01:01:00.803 --> 01:01:01.937
Me neither.

01:01:12.581 --> 01:01:14.350
Sorry, buddy.

01:01:14.384 --> 01:01:16.052
I know the trip to the club

01:01:16.085 --> 01:01:18.954
didn't exactly swing
the way you expected.

01:01:18.988 --> 01:01:21.624
That's funny, yeah.

01:01:21.657 --> 01:01:24.394
So, he said he knows you, Mason.

01:01:24.428 --> 01:01:26.695
Is there something
you're not telling us?

01:01:26.729 --> 01:01:28.532
No, definitely not,
definitely not.

01:01:28.564 --> 01:01:30.534
Huh. Yeah.

01:01:31.767 --> 01:01:34.970
So, did you set it up?

01:01:35.004 --> 01:01:36.138
No, dude.

01:01:37.541 --> 01:01:39.375
Mason.

01:01:39.409 --> 01:01:42.011
Okay, maybe I texted her
on the way to the club.

01:01:42.044 --> 01:01:43.547
That's it.

01:01:43.579 --> 01:01:45.214
She was already there.

01:01:45.247 --> 01:01:48.217
Yeah, with her
gay best friend.

01:01:48.250 --> 01:01:50.753
All right, I get it.
Times have changed, right?

01:01:50.786 --> 01:01:52.955
But people have too.

01:01:54.757 --> 01:01:55.891
They haven't all changed.

01:01:58.528 --> 01:02:00.564
I don't think I like
where this is going.

01:02:01.964 --> 01:02:03.032
You know me too well.

01:02:03.065 --> 01:02:05.402
Oh, come on, man, you too?

01:02:05.435 --> 01:02:06.735
Luke, here's the thing.

01:02:08.104 --> 01:02:11.240
You went on a date with some
girl Mason set you up with,

01:02:11.273 --> 01:02:14.076
and then you went on a date
with some crazy girl

01:02:14.110 --> 01:02:16.513
that Terry set you up with.

01:02:16.546 --> 01:02:17.581
Please don't remind me.

01:02:20.049 --> 01:02:21.617
All I'm saying here is...

01:02:24.086 --> 01:02:27.089
you've let Mason who,
with all due respect,

01:02:28.090 --> 01:02:29.526
doesn't know you like I do.

01:02:30.594 --> 01:02:32.429
And Terry...

01:02:32.462 --> 01:02:34.431
I didn't know it was Terry
who was setting me up.

01:02:34.464 --> 01:02:37.733
True, nevertheless,
you went on that date.

01:02:37.766 --> 01:02:40.703
Now, all I'm saying is that
I'm a little bit older

01:02:42.104 --> 01:02:45.808
and a heck of a lot more
wiser and more mature

01:02:45.841 --> 01:02:47.444
than these two knuckleheads.

01:02:48.844 --> 01:02:53.883
And besides, I know you,
the new you,

01:02:54.850 --> 01:02:57.119
much better than they do.

01:02:57.153 --> 01:03:00.624
- Hey, I take exception to that.
- And you should.

01:03:02.158 --> 01:03:04.494
The only reason
I'm even considering this

01:03:04.528 --> 01:03:05.694
is because it's you.

01:03:07.663 --> 01:03:09.633
I wouldn't steer
you wrong, Luke.

01:03:11.468 --> 01:03:12.735
Better not.

01:03:14.937 --> 01:03:16.839
Fine, I'll do it.

01:03:16.872 --> 01:03:19.308
Go ahead, set it up.

01:03:20.676 --> 01:03:21.844
You got it.

01:03:22.878 --> 01:03:24.213
You won't regret it.

01:03:25.147 --> 01:03:28.485
Until the next poker game.

01:03:52.141 --> 01:03:55.911
Hi. Is Daisy home?

01:03:56.912 --> 01:03:58.981
Daisy is my daughter.

01:03:59.014 --> 01:04:02.117
What would be your
intentions with her?

01:04:02.151 --> 01:04:04.286
We're just going out
for a few drinks.

01:04:06.021 --> 01:04:09.024
Boy, I know what
"a few drinks" means.

01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:13.128
No, it's nothing like that.

01:04:14.096 --> 01:04:17.132
Well, butter my butt
and call me a biscuit.

01:04:17.166 --> 01:04:19.536
You, sir, are the first man
on God's green earth

01:04:19.569 --> 01:04:21.237
who's taken a woman out,

01:04:21.270 --> 01:04:23.372
not expecting to get
his tallywhacker wet.

01:04:23.406 --> 01:04:25.241
O-kay.

01:04:26.610 --> 01:04:31.113
Could you get Daisy, please?

01:04:36.952 --> 01:04:40.189
Daisy, holler on out here.

01:04:40.222 --> 01:04:42.258
Got some pretty boy
waiting on you.

01:04:50.232 --> 01:04:52.535
You have my daughter
home by 11:00, you hear?

01:04:52.569 --> 01:04:53.670
I'll sure try.

01:04:55.237 --> 01:04:56.939
Don't test me, boy.

01:04:56.972 --> 01:04:59.241
Daddy, stop.

01:04:59.275 --> 01:05:01.745
Daddy, Daddy, please go inside.

01:05:02.445 --> 01:05:09.918
Please, go inside.

01:05:09.952 --> 01:05:12.054
I'm sorry about that.

01:05:12.087 --> 01:05:13.956
My daddy is a little
over-protective.

01:05:13.989 --> 01:05:15.291
Uh, yeah.

01:05:16.593 --> 01:05:21.564
It is a little weird
for someone so ol... mature

01:05:21.598 --> 01:05:25.267
to still live at home with
her over-protective father.

01:05:25.301 --> 01:05:28.405
But anyway, I'm Lucas.

01:05:29.472 --> 01:05:32.575
I'm Daisy Mae,
but you can me call Daisy.

01:05:32.609 --> 01:05:34.611
It's nice to meet you, Daisy.

01:05:35.779 --> 01:05:38.481
Are you ready to go get crazy?

01:05:38.515 --> 01:05:39.848
Yeah, sounds like fun.

01:05:51.628 --> 01:05:54.129
Wow, nice shot.

01:05:55.765 --> 01:05:57.500
You know what
Daddy always says?

01:05:58.702 --> 01:06:00.804
No, but I'm sure
you're gonna tell me.

01:06:02.271 --> 01:06:04.840
There's one rule
you must always follow

01:06:04.873 --> 01:06:06.676
when you're playing
a game of pool.

01:06:06.710 --> 01:06:08.645
Really?

01:06:08.678 --> 01:06:10.079
And what rule is that?

01:06:10.112 --> 01:06:14.517
You got to chalk
that stick real good.

01:06:20.289 --> 01:06:23.626
What? Cat got your tongue?

01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:25.260
Um, no, no, no, no.

01:06:25.294 --> 01:06:26.429
It's not that.

01:06:28.297 --> 01:06:30.734
Come on, Mr. Man,
whatcha thinking?

01:06:33.503 --> 01:06:34.838
If I'm being honest?

01:06:36.506 --> 01:06:37.873
There's no other way to be.

01:06:39.676 --> 01:06:42.679
I really like the way
you chalk that stick.

01:06:44.547 --> 01:06:47.116
Well, I really like you.

01:06:48.350 --> 01:06:50.820
You're not so bad yourself,
Daisy Mae.

01:06:50.854 --> 01:06:51.954
You like me?

01:06:53.656 --> 01:06:55.891
Yeah, I think you're...

01:06:55.924 --> 01:06:57.092
Sexy?

01:06:58.862 --> 01:07:00.730
Definitely sexy.

01:07:02.331 --> 01:07:03.600
How sexy?

01:07:05.267 --> 01:07:08.303
Do you mean like
on a scale of one to 10 or...?

01:07:09.071 --> 01:07:10.372
You're such a jerk.

01:07:11.674 --> 01:07:14.109
But I'm a cute jerk?

01:07:56.218 --> 01:07:57.986
Is that your dad over there?

01:07:59.254 --> 01:08:01.458
Yeah, that's Daddy.

01:08:01.491 --> 01:08:04.928
- He comes here all the time.
- Hmm. Of course he does.

01:08:06.161 --> 01:08:09.198
Pay him no mind.
He's harmless.

01:08:09.231 --> 01:08:10.265
But I'm not.

01:08:32.154 --> 01:08:33.656
Morning.

01:08:33.689 --> 01:08:36.158
What the f...?

01:08:36.191 --> 01:08:39.161
How did you guys
even get in here?

01:08:39.194 --> 01:08:40.964
The back door.
It's never locked.

01:08:42.331 --> 01:08:43.867
I got to start locking
that door.

01:08:45.067 --> 01:08:46.769
You ever heard of knocking?

01:08:46.803 --> 01:08:48.971
Tried it once, didn't like it.

01:08:51.608 --> 01:08:54.076
And why are you guys here
so early?

01:08:54.109 --> 01:08:55.210
It's 3:00 in the afternoon.

01:08:57.145 --> 01:08:59.348
- It's that late?
- Yeah, sure is.

01:08:59.381 --> 01:09:01.618
Guess somebody had
a great time last night.

01:09:01.651 --> 01:09:04.286
Speaking of which, you should
probably put some clothes on.

01:09:04.319 --> 01:09:05.354
Eh.

01:09:06.956 --> 01:09:11.126
So I came to find out how your date went last night.

01:09:11.158 --> 01:09:13.962
I have no idea why he's here,
I found him out in the yard.

01:09:13.997 --> 01:09:16.466
Dude, did you know your neighbor
showers with her curtains open?

01:09:16.499 --> 01:09:19.002
- Dude, she's, like, 80!
- I know, right?

01:09:21.236 --> 01:09:23.337
So anyway, how was your date?

01:09:23.372 --> 01:09:25.875
It was actually pretty good.

01:09:25.908 --> 01:09:28.877
A little awkward, but good.

01:09:28.912 --> 01:09:30.613
Couldn't get it up, could you?

01:09:30.647 --> 01:09:32.849
You're an idiot, Terry.

01:09:32.881 --> 01:09:35.852
No, that wasn't why.

01:09:35.885 --> 01:09:37.620
So you had sex.

01:09:37.654 --> 01:09:39.187
Nope, didn't have sex.

01:09:39.220 --> 01:09:41.024
Dude, what are you waiting for?

01:09:41.055 --> 01:09:43.191
Do you wanna hear
why the date was awkward or not?

01:09:43.225 --> 01:09:45.127
Yeah, what happened?

01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:48.464
So, I get there to pick her up
and her dad's there,

01:09:48.497 --> 01:09:50.533
and he's trying
to intimidate me.

01:09:50.567 --> 01:09:52.234
Oh, that's it?

01:09:52.267 --> 01:09:53.836
Finally get out of there,
go to the bar,

01:09:53.870 --> 01:09:55.872
and, poof, he's there too.

01:09:55.905 --> 01:09:58.508
That's nothing.

01:09:58.541 --> 01:10:00.309
Oh, my God,
one of my friends knows how to knock.

01:10:00.342 --> 01:10:01.644
Imagine that.

01:10:01.678 --> 01:10:04.013
Come in! Lou's is open.

01:10:04.047 --> 01:10:05.280
Join the party.

01:10:06.549 --> 01:10:07.917
Hey.

01:10:07.951 --> 01:10:09.117
Oh, hey, Brook.

01:10:10.887 --> 01:10:12.220
- Hi.
- Good to see you.

01:10:12.254 --> 01:10:13.756
Sorry, I didn't realize
you had company.

01:10:13.790 --> 01:10:15.692
- Oh. Eh.
- What's the matter?

01:10:15.725 --> 01:10:17.427
You can't say "what's up"
to anyone?

01:10:17.460 --> 01:10:19.495
Hi, Terry. What's up?

01:10:19.529 --> 01:10:21.898
My heart rate
when I'm around you.

01:10:21.931 --> 01:10:23.933
Wow.

01:10:23.967 --> 01:10:26.101
Um, I can come back.

01:10:26.134 --> 01:10:27.670
- Sorry.
- It's okay.

01:10:27.704 --> 01:10:29.572
I just wanted to see
how you were doing.

01:10:29.606 --> 01:10:32.842
I've come by a few times
and called and texted

01:10:32.875 --> 01:10:36.111
more than a few times,
and I just, I never hear back.

01:10:36.144 --> 01:10:38.280
Yeah, I know,
and I'm sorry about that.

01:10:38.313 --> 01:10:42.585
It's just... honestly, I haven't
really known what to say.

01:10:42.619 --> 01:10:45.287
It's okay. I just wanna
make sure you're okay.

01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:47.155
Oh, I appreciate that.

01:10:48.825 --> 01:10:52.095
Okay, so I feel like Terry is
staring at my ass, so I'm gonna go.

01:10:53.763 --> 01:10:55.098
But, hey, it was good
to see you.

01:10:55.130 --> 01:10:56.633
It's really good to see you too.

01:10:58.001 --> 01:10:59.936
- Oh, Luke.
- Yeah.

01:10:59.969 --> 01:11:02.772
Nice boxers.

01:11:05.173 --> 01:11:06.943
- Bye, Brook.
- Bye.

01:11:15.785 --> 01:11:17.120
Hello?

01:11:19.822 --> 01:11:21.824
Oh, you know what, man?

01:11:21.858 --> 01:11:24.627
I'm a little tired anyway,
so we can just do this tomorrow.

01:11:24.661 --> 01:11:25.828
Grab dinner or something.

01:11:31.601 --> 01:11:32.635
All right.

01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:40.943
I am not feeling this.
He'll get over it.

01:11:40.977 --> 01:11:42.145
Second thoughts?

01:11:49.886 --> 01:11:50.987
Do I know you?

01:11:54.023 --> 01:11:55.425
Can't say that you do.

01:12:00.029 --> 01:12:01.397
I swear I've seen you before.

01:12:03.800 --> 01:12:05.168
I get around a lot.

01:12:10.039 --> 01:12:13.843
Okay, then, you, uh...
you have a good night.

01:12:15.078 --> 01:12:18.014
Everything is going to be okay.

01:12:19.314 --> 01:12:20.717
That's it.

01:12:22.418 --> 01:12:24.821
You said that
at my wife's funeral.

01:12:24.854 --> 01:12:26.022
I meant it.

01:12:28.691 --> 01:12:30.193
But you don't know me.

01:12:31.494 --> 01:12:32.862
I don't need to.

01:12:35.898 --> 01:12:38.266
Then how do you know
everything's gonna be okay?

01:12:41.204 --> 01:12:43.206
Just have faith.

01:12:58.286 --> 01:13:01.090
- Is here okay?
- Yeah, this is great, thank you.

01:13:01.124 --> 01:13:02.892
I'll be back
in just a few minutes.

01:13:02.925 --> 01:13:05.094
Yeah, take your time.
I'm still waiting on someone.

01:13:12.068 --> 01:13:13.301
Is this seat taken?

01:13:14.937 --> 01:13:16.439
Brook.

01:13:16.472 --> 01:13:18.441
Unless you're expecting
someone else.

01:13:18.474 --> 01:13:20.643
I was expecting Mason.

01:13:21.477 --> 01:13:24.647
- You were?
- Uh, yeah.

01:13:26.215 --> 01:13:29.252
Um... sit, please.

01:13:29.284 --> 01:13:31.319
- Are you sure?
- Yeah, absolutely.

01:13:37.393 --> 01:13:39.361
So, how are you, Luke?

01:13:40.930 --> 01:13:42.865
Uh, I'm...

01:13:42.899 --> 01:13:46.135
I'm good.
Y-yeah, I'm good.

01:13:46.903 --> 01:13:49.572
Trying to convince me
or yourself?

01:13:49.605 --> 01:13:52.208
No, I'm sorry.
I'm just a little...

01:13:53.976 --> 01:13:55.478
I was expecting Mason.

01:13:56.779 --> 01:13:58.548
Would you rather it be him
than me?

01:13:58.581 --> 01:14:00.348
No. No, no, no, definitely not.

01:14:01.851 --> 01:14:03.019
Good.

01:14:04.420 --> 01:14:06.455
Did he tell you
you were meeting me?

01:14:06.489 --> 01:14:07.957
He did.

01:14:08.758 --> 01:14:13.896
Yeah, and did he tell you
that I knew I was meeting you?

01:14:13.930 --> 01:14:16.165
- Yeah, he did that also.
- Mm-hmm.

01:14:16.199 --> 01:14:19.569
- Yeah. Sounds like Mason.
- It does.

01:14:22.038 --> 01:14:25.308
So he tells me that you've been
going on a lot of bad dates lately.

01:14:27.476 --> 01:14:31.147
Yeah, it's... it's been
pretty rough.

01:14:32.148 --> 01:14:34.750
I didn't know
you were dating again.

01:14:34.784 --> 01:14:39.021
Well, I'm not.
I mean, I...

01:14:39.055 --> 01:14:41.324
No, no, I'm not.

01:14:42.357 --> 01:14:44.327
Sure, you're not, no.

01:14:46.462 --> 01:14:49.065
So, is this where you take
all your dates?

01:14:51.067 --> 01:14:54.971
No, no, it just... this place
usually isn't very crowded,

01:14:55.004 --> 01:14:57.039
so I don't have to deal
with people.

01:14:58.474 --> 01:15:00.743
Yeah, avoiding that deep part
of the question, huh?

01:15:01.644 --> 01:15:03.813
No, no, no, it's not that.

01:15:03.846 --> 01:15:08.517
It's just I wouldn't
really call them dates.

01:15:09.852 --> 01:15:12.421
Honestly, I don't even know
how to date anymore.

01:15:13.389 --> 01:15:15.825
Yeah, me either.

01:15:15.858 --> 01:15:18.427
You forget I've been single
for a really long time.

01:15:19.662 --> 01:15:22.698
Well, I mean, that's because
most guys are idiots.

01:15:23.866 --> 01:15:25.167
Thanks, Luke.

01:15:25.201 --> 01:15:26.569
I mean, I would know.

01:15:26.602 --> 01:15:28.237
I used to be
one of those idiots.

01:15:28.271 --> 01:15:29.739
Yeah, that's true.

01:15:30.907 --> 01:15:33.075
But you've changed
a lot since then.

01:15:35.278 --> 01:15:37.480
Oh, I hope not too much.

01:15:37.513 --> 01:15:40.384
I mean, I like to keep
being all kinds of awesome.

01:15:41.717 --> 01:15:44.053
Okay, you can
keep thinking that.

01:15:44.086 --> 01:15:45.888
Oh, that's what I love
about you, Brook.

01:15:45.922 --> 01:15:48.224
You'll always call me
on my shits.

01:15:49.025 --> 01:15:50.826
I need someone like that
in my life.

01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:53.863
Why? Mason's not doing it
for you anymore?

01:15:53.896 --> 01:15:55.932
No, it's not that.
It's just that...

01:15:57.033 --> 01:15:58.067
Well...

01:15:59.936 --> 01:16:03.506
things are different, you know,
since Grace has been gone.

01:16:03.539 --> 01:16:05.274
I mean...

01:16:05.308 --> 01:16:06.642
I'm different.

01:16:08.911 --> 01:16:10.746
I've been really worried
about you, Luke.

01:16:12.748 --> 01:16:14.684
Yeah, I know. I, um...

01:16:16.085 --> 01:16:18.422
I got all your voice mails
and your texts.

01:16:20.289 --> 01:16:21.457
I just...

01:16:22.925 --> 01:16:26.829
I-I'm just kind of in a place where
I couldn't really talk to anyone.

01:16:27.897 --> 01:16:30.666
But I know you tried
to be there for me,

01:16:31.401 --> 01:16:32.501
and I'll never forget that.

01:16:35.504 --> 01:16:37.373
You really are
a good person, Brook.

01:16:39.075 --> 01:16:40.444
Thanks.

01:16:41.744 --> 01:16:43.612
Hello, I'm Renee.
I'll be your server tonight.

01:16:43.646 --> 01:16:45.047
Are we ready to order?

01:16:45.081 --> 01:16:46.383
Um, you know what?

01:16:46.416 --> 01:16:48.651
We just got right into talking,

01:16:48.684 --> 01:16:50.686
so we haven't even looked
at the menu yet.

01:16:51.787 --> 01:16:53.155
Are you like me?

01:16:53.189 --> 01:16:54.557
Do you already know
what you want?

01:16:56.125 --> 01:16:59.463
No, unlike you, I haven't
been here a thousand times.

01:17:00.296 --> 01:17:01.330
What's good?

01:17:03.499 --> 01:17:05.301
Anything but the shrimp.

01:17:07.770 --> 01:17:09.672
Okay.

01:17:09.705 --> 01:17:11.841
I had such a good time tonight.

01:17:11.874 --> 01:17:12.975
I did too.

01:17:15.378 --> 01:17:18.147
Again, I gotta be honest,

01:17:18.180 --> 01:17:20.683
I was really surprised
to see you.

01:17:20.716 --> 01:17:23.886
I mean, it's great that Mason
didn't show up and you did, but...

01:17:25.354 --> 01:17:27.523
I'm glad.
I'm glad you're happy.

01:17:27.556 --> 01:17:29.925
I was. I am.

01:17:30.559 --> 01:17:33.430
I mean, how long has it been,

01:17:33.463 --> 01:17:37.700
I mean, since me and you
got to hang out just me and you?

01:17:40.470 --> 01:17:43.272
Sometimes I really miss
the old days.

01:17:43.305 --> 01:17:45.808
Yeah, me too.

01:17:45.841 --> 01:17:47.444
We should do this more often.

01:17:48.210 --> 01:17:49.513
I would love to.

01:17:53.015 --> 01:17:54.518
What are you thinking about?

01:17:56.152 --> 01:17:59.221
I hate to say it,
but I think Mason was right.

01:18:00.322 --> 01:18:01.590
Right about what?

01:18:03.259 --> 01:18:08.030
It's like he somehow knew that
if I got to hang out with you

01:18:08.064 --> 01:18:12.068
that I would feel like
my old self again.

01:18:13.002 --> 01:18:16.338
Well, I'm glad that I can help
you feel like your old self again.

01:18:16.372 --> 01:18:17.840
Me too.

01:18:17.873 --> 01:18:20.576
I mean, wow,
I can't even tell you.

01:18:20.609 --> 01:18:25.081
Like, just the being out
without the pressure of dating,

01:18:25.114 --> 01:18:27.551
you know, just hanging out
with a friend.

01:18:30.420 --> 01:18:31.921
Yeah...

01:18:31.954 --> 01:18:33.557
hanging out with a friend.

01:18:36.792 --> 01:18:39.496
Wait, I'm sorry.

01:18:39.529 --> 01:18:42.198
Did Mason tell you
this was a date?

01:18:42.231 --> 01:18:43.899
- It's okay.
- No...

01:18:43.933 --> 01:18:45.435
I shouldn't have assumed
it was something it wasn't.

01:18:45.469 --> 01:18:47.036
It's fine.

01:18:47.069 --> 01:18:48.671
No, Brook,
that's not how I meant it.

01:18:49.805 --> 01:18:53.510
- It's fine.
- I mean, I guess I...

01:18:53.543 --> 01:18:55.010
Hey, you know what?

01:18:55.044 --> 01:18:57.012
Thank you
for the wonderful evening.

01:18:57.046 --> 01:18:59.748
It was really great
hanging out with a friend.

01:18:59.782 --> 01:19:01.951
No. Brooklyn, plea... wait.

01:19:01.984 --> 01:19:03.119
Brooklyn!

01:19:14.230 --> 01:19:15.264
Damn it, Mason!

01:19:29.278 --> 01:19:30.447
What the hell?

01:19:31.947 --> 01:19:33.249
Jackie?

01:19:33.282 --> 01:19:34.316
Hey, Lucas.

01:19:36.752 --> 01:19:38.320
We need to talk.

01:19:38.354 --> 01:19:40.990
I'm kind of in the middle
of something here.

01:19:41.023 --> 01:19:43.759
You have 30 seconds
to get outside.

01:19:43.792 --> 01:19:46.463
Come on, man.
I can't finish that fast.

01:19:46.496 --> 01:19:48.230
You could join in
if you want to.

01:19:52.868 --> 01:19:54.638
30 seconds outside.

01:19:59.175 --> 01:20:02.178
I'll be right back.
Don't finish without me.

01:20:07.116 --> 01:20:09.351
- The hell, bro?
- No, you don't get to be mad.

01:20:09.386 --> 01:20:12.522
- How do I not get to be mad?
- You set me up with Brooklyn?

01:20:12.556 --> 01:20:14.857
Of course I did.
She's had a thing for you for years.

01:20:14.890 --> 01:20:18.093
- No, she hasn't.
- Don't be an idiot, man.

01:20:18.127 --> 01:20:21.130
She never got over you
and you never got over her.

01:20:21.163 --> 01:20:24.668
Mason, it's Brook.
What were you thinking?

01:20:24.700 --> 01:20:26.135
I was thinking the same thing

01:20:26.168 --> 01:20:28.270
that everyone else
has been thinking,

01:20:28.304 --> 01:20:29.939
that she's the one for you.

01:20:29.972 --> 01:20:32.908
- No, Grace is the one for me.
- Grace is dead.

01:20:38.582 --> 01:20:39.683
Grace is dead, Luke.

01:20:45.154 --> 01:20:46.188
So what?

01:20:47.390 --> 01:20:49.158
I'm just supposed to move on?

01:20:49.191 --> 01:20:51.561
- Is that it?
- Yeah, that's it.

01:20:53.229 --> 01:20:54.263
Can't do it.

01:20:55.197 --> 01:20:56.899
Yeah, you can.

01:20:56.932 --> 01:20:58.435
Grace is gone.
You need to move on.

01:21:01.837 --> 01:21:05.207
All right, I don't need to do
anything you tell me to do,

01:21:05.241 --> 01:21:08.310
including getting over my wife.

01:21:09.245 --> 01:21:10.813
You wanna know what I think?

01:21:10.846 --> 01:21:12.982
No, and I don't really care.

01:21:14.216 --> 01:21:17.186
I think you had a great time
with Brooklyn.

01:21:17.219 --> 01:21:20.289
I think she made you feel things you
haven't felt since you've been with Grace.

01:21:21.424 --> 01:21:22.726
And I think you know
I'm right.

01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:27.597
You got to realize that
this is God's plan for you.

01:21:28.297 --> 01:21:31.434
- You don't even believe in God.
- I don't have to, you do.

01:21:31.468 --> 01:21:33.503
Everything happens
for a reason, right?

01:21:33.536 --> 01:21:35.037
Stop.

01:21:35.070 --> 01:21:36.772
No, you need to hear this.

01:21:36.805 --> 01:21:39.942
You lost your wife,
you lost your faith.

01:21:39.975 --> 01:21:41.844
You lost everything
that you believe in.

01:21:43.580 --> 01:21:45.347
I think it's time
for you to realize

01:21:45.382 --> 01:21:47.651
that you need to live
this life without Grace.

01:21:51.721 --> 01:21:54.391
- You wanna know what I think?
- What do you think?

01:21:54.424 --> 01:21:56.225
I think you're an asshole.

01:21:56.258 --> 01:21:57.793
That's what I think.

01:22:13.443 --> 01:22:15.645
So, you still haven't heard
from Lucas, huh?

01:22:15.679 --> 01:22:18.314
- No. Have you?
- No.

01:22:18.347 --> 01:22:21.651
I tried calling him,
but he isn't answering.

01:22:21.685 --> 01:22:24.421
Yeah, he's not even
answering for me.

01:22:24.454 --> 01:22:25.722
Shut up, Terry.

01:22:27.089 --> 01:22:29.224
This sucks, man.

01:22:29.258 --> 01:22:31.695
I just wanted to help him,
and all I did was make things worse.

01:22:32.828 --> 01:22:34.631
Brother, you can't blame
yourself.

01:22:34.664 --> 01:22:36.633
Yeah, Lucas
is gonna get over it.

01:22:38.635 --> 01:22:40.737
Maybe.
But what if he doesn't?

01:22:42.104 --> 01:22:44.106
He will, brother.

01:22:44.139 --> 01:22:45.974
He just needs time
to process things.

01:22:47.109 --> 01:22:48.977
He's going through
a lot right now.

01:22:49.011 --> 01:22:50.045
Yeah.

01:22:51.880 --> 01:22:53.315
I just wanted
to be there for him.

01:22:55.685 --> 01:22:58.655
I guess I should have known
I'm not that kind of friend.

01:22:58.688 --> 01:22:59.823
Maybe you are.

01:23:02.291 --> 01:23:03.359
What do you mean?

01:23:05.160 --> 01:23:06.328
Think about it.

01:23:08.364 --> 01:23:10.834
I'm thinking about it.
I still won't get it.

01:23:12.301 --> 01:23:13.436
You will.

01:23:15.871 --> 01:23:17.373
Yeah, I don't get it either.

01:23:18.708 --> 01:23:20.042
Shut up, Terry.

01:23:21.043 --> 01:23:22.177
Just shut up.

01:25:23.098 --> 01:25:26.703
Hey, it's Lucas. Yeah.

01:25:27.437 --> 01:25:31.608
Um, so, look,
I know our last date

01:25:31.641 --> 01:25:34.076
didn't exactly end as planned.

01:25:35.845 --> 01:25:38.113
So, I don't know,
what do you, uh...

01:25:38.146 --> 01:25:40.717
what do you think about
maybe giving it another shot?

01:25:44.721 --> 01:25:46.990
Yes, I'm asking you out.

01:25:52.862 --> 01:25:53.997
How about now?

01:25:55.865 --> 01:25:57.967
Okay. No. Great.

01:25:58.001 --> 01:26:00.503
I'll... I'll see you in a bit.

01:26:01.504 --> 01:26:02.539
Okay.

01:26:40.275 --> 01:26:42.712
- Hello, darling.
- Hey, you.

01:26:42.745 --> 01:26:46.549
Should we get out of here
before your dad kills me?

01:26:46.583 --> 01:26:49.018
- Daddy's not home.
- Oh! Mm...

01:26:55.692 --> 01:26:56.726
Oh!

01:27:26.956 --> 01:27:28.891
What's wrong? What's wrong?

01:27:28.925 --> 01:27:29.959
Oh, it's...

01:27:31.894 --> 01:27:33.429
I can't do this.

01:27:34.497 --> 01:27:36.231
Is it me?

01:27:36.264 --> 01:27:41.104
No, no, it's definitely
not you, it's me.

01:27:42.572 --> 01:27:44.807
Oh, honey,
I can help you with that.

01:27:46.976 --> 01:27:48.578
Mm!
Mm-mm, mm-mm.

01:27:48.611 --> 01:27:51.114
No, no, no, it's not that.

01:27:52.280 --> 01:27:54.550
Daisy, I think you're great

01:27:54.584 --> 01:27:57.587
and I'm probably gonna
hate myself for this later,

01:27:57.620 --> 01:27:59.989
but I gotta go.

01:28:00.023 --> 01:28:01.557
I don't understand.

01:28:04.427 --> 01:28:07.262
There's someone else?

01:28:07.295 --> 01:28:10.265
- Then why'd you call me?
- Well, I... whoa.

01:28:10.298 --> 01:28:12.234
What the hell are you doing
with my daughter?

01:28:12.267 --> 01:28:13.503
Daddy, what are you doing home?

01:28:13.536 --> 01:28:15.071
Now, you shush.

01:28:15.104 --> 01:28:16.906
You got five seconds
to explain yourself.

01:28:16.939 --> 01:28:19.509
I'm gonna hit you so hard,
I'll kill your whole family.

01:28:19.542 --> 01:28:22.177
It's not what it looks like.

01:28:22.210 --> 01:28:23.846
Really?

01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:26.115
Well, that's a relief.

01:28:26.149 --> 01:28:29.419
'Cause it looked like you were taking
ol' one-eye to the optometrist.

01:28:29.452 --> 01:28:31.087
What?

01:28:31.120 --> 01:28:33.288
You were trying to have sex
with my daughter!

01:28:33.321 --> 01:28:36.659
- Daddy, he wasn't.
- I told you to be quiet.

01:28:36.693 --> 01:28:39.162
I was not trying to have sex
with your daughter.

01:28:40.630 --> 01:28:42.364
Really?

01:28:42.398 --> 01:28:44.467
'Cause I swear when I walked
in, you were busier

01:28:44.500 --> 01:28:46.268
than a cat covering shit
on the marble floor.

01:28:48.037 --> 01:28:51.674
I... I think I can see
why you would think that,

01:28:51.708 --> 01:28:54.177
but that that's not at all
what it was.

01:28:55.812 --> 01:28:58.014
Daddy, nothing happened.

01:28:58.047 --> 01:28:59.849
Nothing happened, I promise.

01:29:03.920 --> 01:29:06.189
Get. Gone.

01:29:08.024 --> 01:29:10.026
- Now!
- Yeah! Mm-hmm!

01:29:11.861 --> 01:29:13.663
I didn't do anything, Daddy.

01:29:13.696 --> 01:29:16.899
Daddy, I didn't do anything,
I promise.

01:29:18.333 --> 01:29:19.435
I know you didn't.

01:29:20.335 --> 01:29:22.105
So you believe me?

01:29:23.106 --> 01:29:26.442
Honey, that boy didn't know
whether to shit or wind his watch.

01:29:27.744 --> 01:29:29.445
I love you, Daddy.

01:31:54.657 --> 01:31:55.758
Lucas?

01:31:56.859 --> 01:31:58.561
Hi.

01:31:58.594 --> 01:31:59.862
What are you doing here?

01:32:01.264 --> 01:32:02.431
I tried calling.

01:32:03.566 --> 01:32:05.234
Yeah, saw that.

01:32:07.069 --> 01:32:08.237
You didn't call me back.

01:32:10.273 --> 01:32:13.309
I don't know what you want me
to say to you, Luke.

01:32:13.342 --> 01:32:16.112
That's fine. You don't have
to say anything, just listen.

01:32:17.213 --> 01:32:18.281
What do you want?

01:32:19.582 --> 01:32:21.385
- I want to apologize.
- Apologize?

01:32:24.120 --> 01:32:26.656
I wanna apologize for what
happened at the end of our date.

01:32:26.689 --> 01:32:28.392
Oh, it wasn't a date, remember?

01:32:29.892 --> 01:32:33.229
Brook, I'm so sorry I hurt you.

01:32:34.096 --> 01:32:35.932
I... I didn't mean to.

01:32:38.301 --> 01:32:40.102
I know you didn't,

01:32:40.136 --> 01:32:41.971
but that doesn't change
how it felt.

01:32:42.738 --> 01:32:46.842
But I... I would never
intentionally hurt you.

01:32:49.078 --> 01:32:51.380
Okay, thanks for apologizing.
Have a good night.

01:32:51.415 --> 01:32:55.251
No, Brooklyn, come on.

01:32:55.284 --> 01:32:56.819
We've been friends
for way too long.

01:32:59.121 --> 01:33:02.124
What do you want me
to say to you, Luke?

01:33:02.158 --> 01:33:06.796
I thought you saw me
the way that I saw you, finally,

01:33:06.829 --> 01:33:11.233
or the way that you
used to, but you don't.

01:33:11.267 --> 01:33:16.372
And, eventually,
I'll be okay with that.

01:33:16.406 --> 01:33:18.474
But I can't pretend
that it didn't hurt.

01:33:18.507 --> 01:33:21.811
No, Brook, you weren't wrong.
I was wrong.

01:33:21.844 --> 01:33:23.813
I should've never
said that it felt like

01:33:23.846 --> 01:33:27.149
two friends hanging out,
because it didn't.

01:33:27.183 --> 01:33:31.087
You didn't feel like a friend
that night, Brook.

01:33:31.120 --> 01:33:35.459
- You are just saying that.
- I'm not just saying that.

01:33:35.491 --> 01:33:39.061
I'm trying to say what I
should've said that night.

01:33:39.095 --> 01:33:40.963
And what should you
have said that night?

01:33:42.999 --> 01:33:45.469
I should have
said to you that...

01:33:48.371 --> 01:33:51.974
I... I should have told you
that I...

01:33:52.008 --> 01:33:56.779
Exactly! You already said
everything that you have to say.

01:33:56.812 --> 01:33:58.848
So you know what?
Thank you for stopping by.

01:33:58.881 --> 01:34:01.485
- Have a good night.
- Brooklyn, wait.

01:34:01.517 --> 01:34:05.154
Luke, go home. Just go home.

01:34:38.721 --> 01:34:40.424
Oh, you again.

01:34:44.193 --> 01:34:46.028
So much for "everything's
gonna be okay."

01:34:48.731 --> 01:34:51.401
Everything is going to be okay.

01:34:51.435 --> 01:34:52.469
Mm.

01:34:54.236 --> 01:34:56.506
I just hurt my best friend.

01:34:56.540 --> 01:34:57.606
How's that okay?

01:35:00.743 --> 01:35:02.546
She'll be okay.

01:35:03.245 --> 01:35:04.280
So will you.

01:35:06.949 --> 01:35:08.050
I don't see it happening.

01:35:09.785 --> 01:35:13.622
It's not about seeing,
it's about believing.

01:37:09.305 --> 01:37:10.940
- Hey, Brook! Ah!
- Oh, Jesus!

01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:13.943
Oh, my God.

01:37:13.976 --> 01:37:15.044
I'm so sorry.

01:37:15.077 --> 01:37:16.779
Are you okay?

01:37:16.812 --> 01:37:19.715
I'm fine, wasn't planning
to have any kids anyway.

01:37:19.748 --> 01:37:22.117
I'm so sorry, but how was I
supposed to know it was you?

01:37:23.152 --> 01:37:24.720
I need to talk to you.

01:37:24.753 --> 01:37:26.489
So you jump out and scare me?

01:37:26.523 --> 01:37:28.324
Nice way to start
a conversation.

01:37:28.357 --> 01:37:30.292
How'd you know
I'd be here anyway?

01:37:30.326 --> 01:37:32.995
I've known you
for over a decade.

01:37:33.028 --> 01:37:34.363
I think I know
your routine by now.

01:37:34.397 --> 01:37:35.565
Stalker.

01:37:36.365 --> 01:37:38.401
Really?

01:37:38.435 --> 01:37:41.170
You kick me in the balls
and then you call me names?

01:37:41.203 --> 01:37:43.506
I don't think you're the girl
Lucas thinks you are.

01:37:43.540 --> 01:37:45.475
That's why you're here.

01:37:45.508 --> 01:37:47.142
No, of course not.

01:37:47.176 --> 01:37:49.211
Don't lie to me.

01:37:49.245 --> 01:37:51.514
Yeah, fine,
he's the reason I'm here.

01:37:51.548 --> 01:37:53.816
Well, I don't really know
what you or Lucas

01:37:53.849 --> 01:37:55.184
think there's left to say.

01:37:55.217 --> 01:37:57.753
Brook, I know you're upset.

01:37:57.786 --> 01:37:59.656
I never thought
he'd act like that.

01:37:59.689 --> 01:38:02.258
If I did, I wouldn't have
set you up on the date.

01:38:02.291 --> 01:38:04.159
Well, it wasn't a date,
so don't worry about it.

01:38:04.193 --> 01:38:06.095
- It's over.
- But that's just it.

01:38:06.128 --> 01:38:07.697
It's not over.

01:38:07.731 --> 01:38:09.999
It's not over for you,
it's not over for Lucas.

01:38:11.267 --> 01:38:14.203
What do you mean
it's not over for Lucas?

01:38:14.236 --> 01:38:16.839
Let's just say
the last time I saw Lucas,

01:38:18.307 --> 01:38:21.343
the only thing he kept talking about
is how he messed up things with you.

01:38:23.580 --> 01:38:27.116
He said you made him feel things he
hasn't felt since he's been with Grace.

01:38:27.149 --> 01:38:28.784
Lucas said that?

01:38:28.817 --> 01:38:31.186
- Would I lie?
- Yeah.

01:38:32.087 --> 01:38:34.758
Good point,
but I'm not lying about this.

01:38:35.759 --> 01:38:37.594
He tried to apologize to me,

01:38:37.627 --> 01:38:40.530
but I thought he was just
trying to make me feel better.

01:38:41.398 --> 01:38:44.099
He knows he messed up.
He wants to do the right thing.

01:38:44.133 --> 01:38:45.769
Well, he said
we're just friends.

01:38:48.605 --> 01:38:50.973
Have you ever had
your heart broken, Brook?

01:38:51.006 --> 01:38:53.777
Yes, by Lucas years ago.

01:38:55.745 --> 01:38:57.781
Have you ever
had your spouse die

01:38:57.813 --> 01:38:59.482
the morning after your wedding?

01:39:01.116 --> 01:39:03.420
- No.
- Me neither.

01:39:03.453 --> 01:39:05.455
So we both don't know
how damaged Lucas is.

01:39:06.790 --> 01:39:08.991
All I know is
he's crazy about you.

01:39:09.024 --> 01:39:12.127
Maybe it took him longer
to realize that than you'd like.

01:39:12.161 --> 01:39:15.498
Maybe he totally
screwed up that first date

01:39:15.532 --> 01:39:18.735
and maybe, just maybe,
he realized he loves you.

01:39:18.768 --> 01:39:21.103
He can't love me, Mason.

01:39:21.136 --> 01:39:22.605
Stop being so naive.

01:39:22.639 --> 01:39:24.507
The guy's known you
for over 15 years.

01:39:24.541 --> 01:39:26.842
Don't you think those feelings
have always been there?

01:39:27.644 --> 01:39:30.245
- What if you're wrong?
- What if I'm right?

01:39:30.279 --> 01:39:32.247
What if I put myself
out there again

01:39:32.281 --> 01:39:34.451
and he decides that
he's just not interested?

01:39:34.484 --> 01:39:35.851
Or what if I'm a rebound?

01:39:35.884 --> 01:39:38.488
He already had a rebound.

01:39:38.521 --> 01:39:40.122
No, not like that.

01:39:40.155 --> 01:39:41.758
He went on a second date
with that chick

01:39:41.791 --> 01:39:43.426
that Chase set him up with.

01:39:43.460 --> 01:39:46.663
Couldn't pull the trigger,
if you know what I mean.

01:39:46.696 --> 01:39:49.298
He told her his heart
belonged to someone else.

01:39:49.331 --> 01:39:51.668
Yeah, Grace.

01:39:51.701 --> 01:39:54.169
Look, Brooklyn,
all I know is my best friend

01:39:54.203 --> 01:39:56.205
hasn't been happy
for over a year,

01:39:56.238 --> 01:39:59.843
and now, for the first time
in a long time,

01:39:59.875 --> 01:40:01.845
he seems like
he wants to be happy again.

01:40:02.545 --> 01:40:04.947
The problem is

01:40:04.980 --> 01:40:07.049
the only person right now
that can make him happy is you.

01:40:08.518 --> 01:40:09.853
So go make him happy, will you?

01:40:15.392 --> 01:40:17.727
You know something, brother?

01:40:17.761 --> 01:40:21.296
If Brook is the one that you're
supposed to start your life over with,

01:40:21.330 --> 01:40:23.031
then you need to get up
off your ass,

01:40:23.065 --> 01:40:25.802
go out there, and go get her.

01:40:26.403 --> 01:40:30.740
I tried.
I tried to talk to her.

01:40:30.774 --> 01:40:32.876
I tried to apologize to her.

01:40:34.544 --> 01:40:36.078
She wasn't having it.

01:40:37.379 --> 01:40:39.783
So you try again.

01:40:43.386 --> 01:40:44.721
And I'll look desperate.

01:40:46.121 --> 01:40:47.891
Do you love this girl,
Luke?

01:40:49.091 --> 01:40:50.593
Do you wanna be with her?

01:40:50.627 --> 01:40:52.995
- Of course I do.
- Then go be with her.

01:40:55.432 --> 01:40:56.999
It's not that simple.

01:40:58.233 --> 01:41:01.805
You forget, brother,
this ain't my first rodeo.

01:41:07.376 --> 01:41:08.912
You know what
the secret to life is?

01:41:10.747 --> 01:41:11.781
What?

01:41:12.981 --> 01:41:14.016
One thing.

01:41:17.286 --> 01:41:19.188
You're quoting
<i>City Slickers</i>, really?

01:41:20.457 --> 01:41:22.958
One thing, Luke...
you grab onto that...

01:41:24.427 --> 01:41:26.161
everything else don't mean jack.

01:41:32.802 --> 01:41:33.837
You're right.

01:41:34.637 --> 01:41:35.872
You're right.

01:41:37.807 --> 01:41:38.942
Go get your girl.

01:41:39.943 --> 01:41:41.343
I'm gonna go get my girl.

01:41:45.582 --> 01:41:46.850
Right now.

01:41:47.650 --> 01:41:48.952
Oh, yeah, right. I'm...

01:41:48.984 --> 01:41:50.252
Now. I'm gonna go get her.

01:41:50.285 --> 01:41:51.320
Up and at 'em.

01:41:59.596 --> 01:42:01.163
Brooklyn.

01:42:01.196 --> 01:42:02.998
Uh, wh...

01:42:09.706 --> 01:42:10.974
Guys, I'm just...

01:42:13.676 --> 01:42:15.010
I'm just gonna go.

01:42:16.646 --> 01:42:18.948
Nice to see you again, Brooklyn.

01:42:41.404 --> 01:42:43.506
- Luke.
- Yeah.

01:42:43.540 --> 01:42:47.510
I know this is gonna sound crazy,
'cause this is all I've wanted,

01:42:47.544 --> 01:42:49.612
but can we take things
a little slow?

01:42:49.646 --> 01:42:52.549
Yeah, of course.

01:42:52.582 --> 01:42:55.150
I want you and I really wanna
be with you,

01:42:55.183 --> 01:42:58.688
but I want all of you,
Luke, not just this.

01:42:59.354 --> 01:43:00.657
That's fine.

01:43:00.690 --> 01:43:02.190
We don't have to do this
right now.

01:43:02.224 --> 01:43:05.127
We can wait as long as you want.

01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:09.131
- Thanks. Date night?
- Date night.

01:43:09.164 --> 01:43:11.000
- What do you have in mind?
- Hmm.

01:43:11.034 --> 01:43:14.737
You, me, <i>Pulp Fiction</i> ?

01:43:14.771 --> 01:43:16.039
You know me too well.

01:43:19.509 --> 01:43:21.044
- I'll get the popcorn.
- Okay.

01:43:24.179 --> 01:43:25.213
Stay.

01:43:26.616 --> 01:43:29.151
What... what happened
with taking it slow?

01:43:29.184 --> 01:43:32.722
On second thought, I think
we've waited long enough.

01:44:44.159 --> 01:44:45.495
Good morning, beautiful.

01:44:45.528 --> 01:44:46.829
Good morning.

01:44:49.432 --> 01:44:52.234
Last night was amazing.

01:44:54.871 --> 01:44:57.339
Is this is the part where you
tell me that we're just friends?

01:45:01.611 --> 01:45:03.413
Thank you for giving me
another chance.

01:45:03.446 --> 01:45:05.548
Well, you can
thank Mason for that.

01:45:06.281 --> 01:45:10.285
Mm, yeah, I guess he did turn
out to be a pretty good friend.

01:45:10.318 --> 01:45:13.355
But he did set me up
with some horrible dates.

01:45:13.389 --> 01:45:15.658
Yeah, but look where
those horrible dates led you.

01:45:17.493 --> 01:45:19.162
- Right where I'm supposed to be.
- Mm.

01:45:24.232 --> 01:45:25.768
Can I make you breakfast?

01:45:25.802 --> 01:45:28.270
As much as I'd like
to stay with you,

01:45:28.303 --> 01:45:31.441
and I do want
to stay here with you,

01:45:31.474 --> 01:45:33.409
we both know I have
a routine to keep.

01:45:34.711 --> 01:45:37.312
You mean that marathon
that you run every morning?

01:45:37.345 --> 01:45:39.682
It's not a marathon, but, yes,

01:45:39.716 --> 01:45:41.184
that's what I'm talking about.

01:45:42.819 --> 01:45:47.190
Can't you just skip a day?

01:45:47.222 --> 01:45:48.858
How about we see
if you can make breakfast

01:45:48.891 --> 01:45:50.526
by the time I get back
from my run?

01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:53.396
- Hmm, challenge accepted.
- Mm.

01:45:55.531 --> 01:45:56.799
Oh.

01:46:15.852 --> 01:46:17.220
- Morning.
- Morning.

01:46:25.061 --> 01:46:27.096
- Hey.
- Hey.

01:46:29.264 --> 01:46:30.733
You okay?

01:46:30.767 --> 01:46:33.035
Yeah, yeah. I'm just...

01:46:33.069 --> 01:46:34.237
I'm really happy to see you.

01:46:36.572 --> 01:46:39.108
Brook, can I tell you something?

01:46:39.142 --> 01:46:40.676
Yeah, you can tell me anything.

01:46:42.411 --> 01:46:46.749
These last few months,
I mean, really, the last year,

01:46:48.718 --> 01:46:53.189
it's been so crazy,
just ups and downs,

01:46:53.222 --> 01:46:59.128
some really brutal downs,
and I know its gonna sound cliché,

01:46:59.162 --> 01:47:02.899
but I think, I believe now,

01:47:02.932 --> 01:47:06.135
that everything happens
for a reason.

01:47:07.436 --> 01:47:09.304
I mean, I needed
to go through all that

01:47:10.506 --> 01:47:12.508
to kinda get to
where I am today.

01:47:13.910 --> 01:47:17.947
To be the man that I am,

01:47:17.980 --> 01:47:20.283
the man that you deserve.

01:47:22.785 --> 01:47:24.352
I'm so happy.

01:47:29.525 --> 01:47:30.993
I love you, Brooklyn.

01:47:32.295 --> 01:47:33.963
I love you too, Lucas.

01:48:01.891 --> 01:48:03.593
Hey, Luke.

01:48:03.626 --> 01:48:04.694
Yeah.

01:48:04.727 --> 01:48:06.329
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:48:09.832 --> 01:48:10.867
Yeah.

01:49:08.458 --> 01:49:13.458
