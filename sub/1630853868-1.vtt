00:21.833 --> 00:23.750
Terrorblade!

00:32.208 --> 00:35.458
You will return the pillars
to their foundation.

00:35.541 --> 00:38.583
You will restore the manifold form.

00:38.666 --> 00:42.375
The blind arrogance of dragons.

00:42.458 --> 00:46.958
You see my prison.
You failed to see my fortress.

00:48.625 --> 00:52.666
You failed to see my army.

01:55.041 --> 01:58.958
She's fast.
Watch yourself. Don't break rank.

02:06.125 --> 02:07.666
Praise the Moon of Mene.

02:08.833 --> 02:10.541
-<i>Look at you.</i>

02:11.208 --> 02:15.625
<i>Little better than an animal
hunted by your lessers.</i>

02:16.250 --> 02:19.166
But you had such dreams.

02:19.250 --> 02:23.708
Oh, yes. For a moment, you were feared.

02:24.458 --> 02:28.458
You stood on the precipice
of restoring the rightful order.

02:28.541 --> 02:32.000
Your people, masters of the world.

02:32.750 --> 02:35.750
I know who you are.
You're the demon, aren't you?

02:35.833 --> 02:38.208
His demon.
You attacked the Nightsilver Woods.

02:38.291 --> 02:43.041
Oh, I am more. I am your hope.

02:43.125 --> 02:45.041
Hope. Hope for what?

02:45.125 --> 02:50.250
A world reshaped to your liking.
We can build it together.

02:50.333 --> 02:54.916
But first,
revenge on the one who lied to us,

02:55.000 --> 02:59.208
betrayed us, asked us to serve him…

03:00.291 --> 03:02.916
then abandoned us.

03:04.166 --> 03:07.791
I'm half-mad from exhaustion, not stupid.

03:07.875 --> 03:08.916
Fuck off, demon.

03:13.208 --> 03:15.625
Oh, you're afraid.

03:15.708 --> 03:19.291
You can't evade them forever.
You know this.

03:19.375 --> 03:23.916
The hour comes round for death or hope.

03:24.000 --> 03:25.166
You there!

03:25.250 --> 03:27.041
You heard me.

03:28.250 --> 03:33.083
I hear you, and answer with death.

03:49.708 --> 03:50.791
Aah! Hmph.

03:58.583 --> 04:00.166
Aah!

04:06.458 --> 04:09.208
I'd hate to break my arm patting myself
on the back,

04:09.291 --> 04:11.458
but that sword was pretty great.

04:11.541 --> 04:15.833
I-- I mean, you were great.
It was all you, but the sword was just--

04:15.916 --> 04:18.125
-Great?
-Pretty good, anyway.

04:18.208 --> 04:21.041
Little loud on the backswing,
but as good as Father ever made.

04:21.125 --> 04:24.333
Well technically, Father did make it.
I just repaired it.

04:24.416 --> 04:26.125
The point is, the Foundry works.

04:26.208 --> 04:27.666
I made it work.

04:28.625 --> 04:32.125
Hey, this is the part
where you're supposed to act excited,

04:32.208 --> 04:34.833
or at least seem cautiously optimistic.

04:34.916 --> 04:37.250
Sorry. It's Slyrak.

04:37.333 --> 04:40.625
It's been almost three months.
Three months and nothing.

04:40.708 --> 04:44.375
Not a vision, not even a dream,
not so much as a feeling.

04:44.458 --> 04:47.500
The world is still here.
So, that seems like a good sign.

04:47.583 --> 04:51.125
The dragons are still acting crazy.
That seems like a bad one.

04:51.208 --> 04:53.166
All we can do is clean up the mess.

04:53.250 --> 04:54.875
Look, I know you're frustrated.

04:54.958 --> 04:59.125
I know you feel left behind,
like you didn't get to finish the fight,

04:59.208 --> 05:02.291
but you did your part
better than anyone could have expected.

05:02.375 --> 05:04.333
More than anyone had any right to ask.

05:04.416 --> 05:07.583
Three months. Not a gods damn thing.

05:10.958 --> 05:12.791
<i>Davion,
there's something you should see.</i>

05:12.875 --> 05:14.916
I was thinking about what you said
last night,

05:15.000 --> 05:17.833
so I started plotting
all the recent dragon sightings.

05:17.916 --> 05:22.083
Not just the ones you and I went after,
but Kaden, and everyone else.

05:22.166 --> 05:25.541
I worked it backwards, figured out
the wyrmlings most likely paths.

05:25.625 --> 05:27.458
They're migrating. So what?

05:27.541 --> 05:29.791
Well, that's what I thought too, at first.

05:29.875 --> 05:33.791
But that's not migration,
that's convergence.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.208
<i>Earth, water, ember,</i>

05:36.291 --> 05:39.125
they're coming together
like last year at Dragon Hold.

05:39.208 --> 05:40.625
I mean, it doesn't make sense.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.791
There's nothing important
in the Broken Peaks.

05:42.875 --> 05:45.250
-It's just a bunch of rocks.
-Pack up the camp.

05:45.333 --> 05:46.583
We need to go.

05:48.083 --> 05:49.625
I know what's in the Broken Peaks.

05:51.333 --> 05:54.708
The Seventh Legion
reports they have yet to receive

05:54.791 --> 05:56.583
supplemental forces,

05:56.666 --> 06:00.416
and we've had some trouble
maintaining our supply chain in--

06:00.500 --> 06:03.708
The Fourth Legion is heavy.
We should reassign the excess.

06:03.791 --> 06:08.083
Mm, Legatus Akkad claims
he needs the additional soldiers

06:08.166 --> 06:10.416
to maintain a proper training rotation.

06:10.500 --> 06:13.375
While the Seventh withers and starves
on the frontier.

06:13.458 --> 06:18.000
The Seventh has no patron in the capital,
Your Radiance.

06:18.083 --> 06:20.083
Jackals, all of them.

06:20.166 --> 06:24.208
The only way to manage the war council
is with a blunt instrument.

06:24.291 --> 06:28.541
I'm afraid you will be even less happy
with the merchant's guild.

06:28.625 --> 06:29.916
Majesty.

06:30.958 --> 06:34.041
-Forgive the interruption.
-Don't be silly.

06:34.125 --> 06:38.750
We were just admiring how the Imperium
pulls together after a crisis.

06:38.833 --> 06:40.041
How can I help you?

06:40.125 --> 06:43.416
You have a visitor, an old friend.

06:44.083 --> 06:44.958
Davion.

06:45.041 --> 06:49.708
You don't need to announce him.
I envy him a bit, life on the road.

06:49.791 --> 06:52.041
It's not the Dragon Knight,
Your Radiance.

06:52.125 --> 06:54.000
It's complicated.

06:54.625 --> 06:59.125
<i>She surrendered at the city gates,
demanding to see you.</i>

07:01.458 --> 07:03.500
And they threw her
in the stockade?

07:03.583 --> 07:07.833
She insisted on it.
She said it was "comfortable."

07:09.125 --> 07:12.250
-Princess.
-Empress Mirana, Her Majesty.

07:12.333 --> 07:14.208
It's all right, Asar.

07:14.291 --> 07:16.916
-Luna?
-Forgive me, Empress.

07:17.666 --> 07:20.791
I've come to swear my allegiance
to the Solar Goddess.

07:20.875 --> 07:22.958
I've come to serve you.

07:26.250 --> 07:29.208
By the time we reached
the first enclave, we started to see them.

07:29.291 --> 07:31.166
Our own soldiers,

07:31.250 --> 07:34.791
wandering without the power Selemene
once granted.

07:34.875 --> 07:38.166
<i>To the men and women,
they told the same story,</i>

07:38.250 --> 07:40.458
<i>how the shrines came to life.</i>

07:40.541 --> 07:43.250
<i>How the goddess's blessing
coursed through them.</i>

07:43.333 --> 07:47.916
How they took their revenge
and gave the lie to a false prophecy.

07:48.000 --> 07:50.125
Yet some had questions.

07:50.208 --> 07:52.750
They wrestled with an emptiness
in their guts,

07:52.833 --> 07:56.625
and they knew what love
there may have been had passed.

07:57.375 --> 08:02.041
I gathered and sheltered them,
sent scouts far and wide to find more,

08:02.125 --> 08:04.875
the lost, the broken, the undone.

08:04.958 --> 08:07.875
-And you brought them all here?
-I brought them to you.

08:07.958 --> 08:13.166
You asked me to save them, and so I have,
and now I ask you to give them a purpose.

08:13.250 --> 08:15.416
Give me a purpose.

08:15.500 --> 08:19.500
Let us fight for you.
Let us remake the world in your image.

08:19.583 --> 08:22.208
Remake the world?

08:22.291 --> 08:24.666
I can barely rebuild this place.

08:24.750 --> 08:26.416
Because you think you're alone.

08:26.500 --> 08:29.208
We used to believe in something, we two.

08:29.291 --> 08:32.041
Nothing is so broken it cannot be fixed.

08:32.125 --> 08:34.583
Now you have the power to fix it all.

08:34.666 --> 08:36.250
The power of a god.

08:36.333 --> 08:40.291
The power of an empire. Most important…

08:40.375 --> 08:42.875
now you have me.

08:46.041 --> 08:47.208
Free her, Asar.

08:48.291 --> 08:50.916
Majesty! She is the Scourge.

08:51.000 --> 08:53.666
She is my friend.

08:59.000 --> 09:01.083
Itches like the Fifth Hell.

09:01.166 --> 09:04.500
Pretty sure these accouterments
don't come in Oglodi size.

09:04.583 --> 09:08.291
And I'm certain those shiny sons
of bitches would rather they never do.

09:08.375 --> 09:11.291
Think of it this way,
no one is staring at your ears.

09:11.375 --> 09:13.708
Anyone says a word about your ears
answers to me.

09:14.291 --> 09:16.125
Now, fall in.

09:18.625 --> 09:21.250
If nothing fit,
you could at least wear a banner.

09:21.333 --> 09:24.666
No, no, no.
It is not that, my lovely. It is more.

09:24.750 --> 09:31.708
I am still Nivan Gallant in my heart,
but, uh, my sword remains at your service.

09:31.791 --> 09:33.541
You never cease to confuse me.

09:33.625 --> 09:35.875
Eh, we must all have goals.

09:35.958 --> 09:41.625
You are certain this is yours,
this uniform, this banner?

09:41.708 --> 09:43.583
Not the banner, her.

09:44.250 --> 09:47.250
Who kneels before the Solar Throne?

09:47.333 --> 09:49.375
I do, Your Radiance.

09:49.458 --> 09:52.541
Luna of the plains
and the Nightsilver Woods.

09:52.625 --> 09:56.666
I offer you my heart,
my courage, my steel.

09:56.750 --> 09:59.416
I seek your light, your love.

09:59.500 --> 10:04.291
I take you as God Empress,
first in thought, first in action.

10:04.375 --> 10:07.958
Stand in the light. And these soldiers?

10:08.041 --> 10:11.458
My Lost Legion.
Many have fought for you already.

10:11.541 --> 10:15.750
Their devotion is inscribed in scars,
inked by pain.

10:16.458 --> 10:20.583
Accept the blessing of the Solar Throne,
Luna of the Imperium.

10:22.291 --> 10:25.458
Luna, the goddess of the Lost Legion.

10:32.041 --> 10:34.916
Together we will rebuild our home.

10:35.708 --> 10:39.416
Then we will heal a broken world.

10:46.916 --> 10:47.916
Your Majesty.

10:49.625 --> 10:50.791
Dragon Knight.

10:53.041 --> 10:56.916
Oh, you're home. Finally.

11:01.666 --> 11:04.000
Something's wrong.
Is Bram with you? Is he--

11:04.083 --> 11:05.958
Bram is fine. Bram is here.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.416
-Kaden, too.
-Then what?

11:10.208 --> 11:13.375
Slyrak is dead. Slyrak failed.

11:34.500 --> 11:37.291
I see you've abandoned subtlety.

11:39.666 --> 11:43.000
The Father of Fire failed. You are alone.

11:43.083 --> 11:47.291
You betrayed or abandoned anyone
who might have come to your aid,

11:47.375 --> 11:49.583
the godling, the elves.

11:51.875 --> 11:54.500
I am all you have left in the world.

11:54.583 --> 11:56.541
Surrender the dragon souls,

11:56.625 --> 12:02.416
and when I remake reality,
I will leave you a gift, your child,

12:02.500 --> 12:08.708
safe with you here,
untouched in this oasis you've created.

12:08.791 --> 12:12.083
Immortal Filomena.

12:12.166 --> 12:16.083
This is my bond, my renegotiation.

12:16.166 --> 12:20.125
You offer all revised terms
per the original Shopkeeper's coven?

12:20.208 --> 12:23.041
-Inviolable.
-You guarantee…

12:23.125 --> 12:26.208
the child will be my Filomena,
as I remember her.

12:26.291 --> 12:27.916
She'll be mine in every way.

12:28.000 --> 12:30.875
Filomena will love you in the next life

12:30.958 --> 12:32.916
as she loved you in this one.

12:33.458 --> 12:36.875
She'll be healthy,
free of the rot that claimed her?

12:36.958 --> 12:41.125
I promise, an eternity of flowers.

12:41.208 --> 12:44.791
What would you not do to feel her hand…

12:45.541 --> 12:47.500
<i>in your own again?</i>

12:48.916 --> 12:51.958
I love you. I won't worship you.

12:54.166 --> 12:55.083
Nothing.

12:55.916 --> 12:57.666
There is nothing I would not.

12:57.750 --> 13:00.666
Then we have a bargain?

13:00.750 --> 13:03.333
My daughter, so willful.

13:03.416 --> 13:06.791
And she had a good heart,
and she was wise.

13:06.875 --> 13:10.416
Filomena would never accept
a world made by you.

13:10.500 --> 13:14.375
She would never accept a horror
created in her name.

13:15.708 --> 13:17.250
There will be no bargain.

13:17.333 --> 13:19.416
So be it.

14:53.250 --> 14:54.416
So be it.

14:58.208 --> 15:00.708
Mirana can't send an army
to the Broken Peaks,

15:00.791 --> 15:02.291
but she can send us.

15:02.375 --> 15:03.833
The Sage. His tower.

15:03.916 --> 15:06.666
Hmm. It's to be revenge, then.

15:06.750 --> 15:11.208
No. He has something quite valuable
that does not belong to him.

15:11.291 --> 15:15.625
The demon who laid waste
to the Nightsilver Woods wants it badly.

15:15.708 --> 15:19.791
An army of dragons is coming for it.
While they kill each other--

15:19.875 --> 15:21.250
We take it back.

15:21.333 --> 15:23.500
<i>That would be unwise.</i>

15:25.958 --> 15:30.291
And quite unnecessary.
I'm here to propose an alliance.

15:32.041 --> 15:35.625
You lied to us. You betrayed us.
You used Fymryn--

15:35.708 --> 15:37.416
I told you the truth.

15:37.500 --> 15:39.125
The parts that suited you.

15:39.208 --> 15:40.916
-Who is this guy?

15:41.000 --> 15:44.208
-The Devil of the Moon.
-He has a lovely voice.

15:44.291 --> 15:46.500
We know the dragon souls
are in your possession.

15:46.583 --> 15:48.833
Release them,
and our business is concluded.

15:48.916 --> 15:51.916
You will be allowed to leave unharmed.

15:52.000 --> 15:54.916
Congratulations
on your apotheosis, Majesty,

15:55.000 --> 15:58.500
but you understand not one-thousandth
of your power.

15:58.583 --> 16:00.625
I advise humility.

16:02.166 --> 16:04.875
The dragons who concerned you are ash,

16:04.958 --> 16:07.958
yet Terrorblade remains,
more powerful than ever.

16:08.041 --> 16:10.000
He commands three dragon souls

16:10.083 --> 16:13.083
and will not rest
until he claims all eight.

16:13.166 --> 16:15.833
Individually, they are vulnerable.

16:15.916 --> 16:20.208
Together, with me, they are safer,
but they are far from safe.

16:20.291 --> 16:25.291
Well, if you're so powerful,
what possible need could you have of us?

16:26.125 --> 16:28.958
Terrorblade is a patient
and relentless enemy.

16:29.041 --> 16:32.666
I survived only through extreme means
he failed to consider.

16:33.375 --> 16:34.916
He will not repeat his error.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.916
So, I do have need of you, Majesty.

16:38.000 --> 16:41.833
I need a god
to take the fight to Foulfell.

16:41.916 --> 16:45.875
Once there,
I will destroy Terrorblade myself.

16:53.000 --> 16:55.166
<i>I have to go. I have to see.</i>

16:55.250 --> 16:58.041
You have to be who you are.

16:58.125 --> 16:59.541
Perhaps, she's learned.

16:59.625 --> 17:02.291
She cannot be other than what she is.

17:02.375 --> 17:04.416
You knew this would happen, didn't you?

17:04.500 --> 17:08.125
I calculated a high probability
of these events, yes.

17:08.208 --> 17:12.166
There are, however,
aspects I did not foresee.

17:12.250 --> 17:14.416
-Aspects?
-How I would feel.

17:15.250 --> 17:17.333
That always surprises me, too.

17:17.416 --> 17:21.250
You came to me with the prophecy.
I made you a promise.

17:21.333 --> 17:25.375
I anticipate both will be fulfilled,
goddess.

17:28.083 --> 17:29.916
Our goddess waits for you.

17:34.583 --> 17:38.333
Selemene's moonlight shines through me,
luminous and pure.

17:38.416 --> 17:40.625
My soul is sealed in her servitude.

17:53.625 --> 17:55.625
Welcome, little Coedwen.

17:59.541 --> 18:01.375
Child of the Moon.

18:05.958 --> 18:09.541
Don't just stand there acting
like you have our best interests in mind.

18:09.625 --> 18:12.333
You were working with Terrorblade.
You had to be.

18:12.416 --> 18:14.416
Nothing is stopping you
from doing it again.

18:14.500 --> 18:16.833
For all we know, that's why you're here.

18:16.916 --> 18:21.375
Your accusations are accurate,
and you are justified in your concerns.

18:21.458 --> 18:23.875
I'm a little more than concerned.

18:23.958 --> 18:26.875
Your reservations do not change
the reality of the circumstances

18:26.958 --> 18:30.541
or the necessity of Her Majesty's choice.

18:30.625 --> 18:33.291
-We'd have to be crazy to do this.
-I agree.

18:33.375 --> 18:35.375
I guess that's it, then.
Thanks for coming.

18:35.458 --> 18:36.791
Now, about the souls.

18:36.875 --> 18:39.625
I said, I agree. I will help you.

18:40.458 --> 18:42.666
There are arrangements I must make.

18:43.500 --> 18:45.250
I will return tomorrow at dawn.

18:55.041 --> 18:57.541
Is it just as you imagined?

18:57.625 --> 19:02.916
No, it's like a memory,
but a memory of a dream.

19:03.000 --> 19:05.416
It was brighter. There was music.

19:05.500 --> 19:08.208
It was like home before the war, I mean.

19:09.000 --> 19:13.041
There is no war here,
no death, no suffering.

19:13.125 --> 19:17.166
Those events were regrettable,
but they are behind us now.

19:17.250 --> 19:21.750
Forgive me, Goddess.
I can't just pretend they never happened.

19:21.833 --> 19:24.041
Do you love me?

19:24.125 --> 19:27.416
I came to you with a purpose.
We can unite our people together.

19:27.500 --> 19:29.541
Speak the words.

19:30.458 --> 19:33.666
Do you love me?

19:39.958 --> 19:41.708
Goddess? Something is…

19:47.750 --> 19:50.916
You will remember none of this,
little Coedwen.

19:51.000 --> 19:55.250
You will remember only renewed,
intense love for me.

19:56.125 --> 19:57.250
No!

19:57.916 --> 19:58.875
No.

20:03.333 --> 20:06.958
He sent you to me. You lied to me.

20:07.041 --> 20:10.458
I believed there could be good in you.
I didn't want him to be right.

20:15.958 --> 20:17.125
Enough.

20:19.375 --> 20:22.583
The spark. It's mine.

20:22.666 --> 20:25.333
You will not take it from me.

20:25.416 --> 20:26.833
No!

20:27.750 --> 20:29.750
No!

20:31.500 --> 20:33.458
No!

20:36.125 --> 20:40.750
It's mine. Please, it's mine.

20:44.041 --> 20:45.541
You must think me mad.

20:46.500 --> 20:48.375
I have no reason to trust him.

20:48.458 --> 20:51.250
Nor reason to believe
this is anything more than another ruse

20:51.333 --> 20:53.458
that ends in bloodshed and tragedy.

20:54.291 --> 20:56.833
But I also believe we have no options.

20:56.916 --> 20:59.500
-None of this is as I thought it would be.

20:59.583 --> 21:03.583
The Imperium, Selemene, Davion.

21:05.958 --> 21:07.125
Gods, I miss you.

21:08.333 --> 21:09.750
I figured you'd be here.

21:09.833 --> 21:12.041
She was always a better listener than me.

21:12.125 --> 21:13.583
You're an excellent listener.

21:13.666 --> 21:15.083
-I'm the worst.
-True.

21:16.666 --> 21:18.500
I know you don't approve.

21:18.583 --> 21:21.583
-I wish I could explain it to you, but--
-You don't have to.

21:21.666 --> 21:24.875
If you think this is the right thing,
this is the right thing.

21:24.958 --> 21:28.666
I was hoping you were about to tell me
how wrong I am.

21:28.750 --> 21:30.750
-Are you?
-I don't know.

21:30.833 --> 21:32.875
Then there isn't anything I need to say.

21:32.958 --> 21:36.500
I trust your doubt more than
I trust anybody else's certainty.

21:42.791 --> 21:44.625
You don't have to be here for this.

21:45.666 --> 21:48.958
But I do, Majesty.
He's going to prove himself a liar.

21:49.041 --> 21:51.750
When he does,
I intend to collect his head.

21:52.625 --> 21:53.916
The hour has come.

21:54.916 --> 21:59.583
Not quite. Two things, if you
want help, we need something from you.

21:59.666 --> 22:02.291
The five dragon souls.
Impossible.

22:02.375 --> 22:04.416
The container is mystically bound to me.

22:04.500 --> 22:08.041
Were I to leave this plane without them,
containment would end.

22:08.125 --> 22:10.250
They would be released, vulnerable.

22:10.333 --> 22:12.333
You're the genius. Figure it out.

22:12.416 --> 22:15.291
Which brings me to the second thing.
I'm going with you.

22:15.375 --> 22:16.625
Preposterous.

22:16.708 --> 22:21.083
This isn't an argument.
The boy's going. We're all going.

22:21.166 --> 22:23.208
We all owe the bastard something.

22:23.291 --> 22:24.833
Those are my terms.

22:26.416 --> 22:30.291
There is a way.
You have contained one dragon soul.

22:30.375 --> 22:34.166
You may be able to contain more,
at least for a time.

22:39.666 --> 22:43.333
The dragon souls,
the Element of Air,

22:43.416 --> 22:45.875
the Four Fundamental Forces.

22:45.958 --> 22:48.000
The Pillars of Creation, I know.

22:48.500 --> 22:52.583
When this is over, this is over.
The souls will be released.

22:52.666 --> 22:56.875
The souls will be released
and the natural order restored.

22:58.375 --> 22:59.875
Do what you have to do.

23:04.500 --> 23:07.250
The Forge channels
the dragons' power.

23:07.333 --> 23:10.250
When it is done,
their souls will reside within you.

23:10.333 --> 23:12.458
So long as you survive.

23:27.708 --> 23:29.583
There will be some pain.

23:32.208 --> 23:37.083
My time has passed.
The spark has returned to you.

23:37.166 --> 23:40.166
Soon, my life will slip into the void…

23:41.000 --> 23:42.000
forgotten.

23:42.083 --> 23:43.291
It's not too late.

23:43.375 --> 23:46.333
We can appear to them together,
heal the rift.

23:46.416 --> 23:49.791
I did what I could
to heal what had been broken,

23:49.875 --> 23:54.750
to shelter the lost,
and bring light to the shadows.

23:54.833 --> 23:57.583
But that's not what you did at all.
You broke everything.

23:57.666 --> 24:01.666
There was a rot in you,
around you, a madness.

24:03.875 --> 24:07.875
The wisdom of a god would seem
a kind of madness to the powerless.

24:09.166 --> 24:15.083
You were mad once, too,
and you will be mad again.

24:15.166 --> 24:18.250
Praise the Moon of Mene.
