WEBVTT

00:01.802 --> 00:03.337
(loud heavy metal music playing)

00:03.371 --> 00:05.206
(audience cheering)

00:11.279 --> 00:15.316
* One knock, one spill,
one look and it's on *

00:15.349 --> 00:19.053
* Half cut, half thrill,
don't care if you're wrong *

00:19.087 --> 00:22.556
* You're standing heart is
beating over shouting *

00:22.590 --> 00:25.759
* Blood boiling
whatcha gonna do about it? *

00:25.793 --> 00:29.563
* Go, go, you say
you want to go? *

00:29.597 --> 00:33.267
* Outside, yeah,
this place is ready to blow *

00:33.301 --> 00:36.470
* Fight, fight, put your money
where your mouth is *

00:36.504 --> 00:40.208
* Hear you talking, bro, you
gonna do something about it? *

00:40.241 --> 00:43.777
(music fades)

00:52.253 --> 00:55.623
(music gets louder)

00:55.656 --> 00:59.127
* They're leaving,
whatcha gonna do about it? *

00:59.160 --> 01:03.164
* Go, go, you say
you want to go? *

01:03.197 --> 01:07.268
* Outside, yeah, this place
is ready to blow *

01:07.301 --> 01:11.539
* Fight, put your money
where your mouth is... *

01:11.572 --> 01:13.441
Freeze! Metro police.

01:17.845 --> 01:19.113
Oh, my God.

01:19.147 --> 01:20.848
Get the bomb squad
down here.

01:20.881 --> 01:23.184
MAN:
Yes, sir.
Dispatch, this is Metro...

01:23.217 --> 01:24.752
Release the balloon.

01:27.188 --> 01:28.289
Turn around,

01:28.322 --> 01:30.324
terrorist bastard.

01:35.829 --> 01:38.732
Aristotle banana split.

01:43.837 --> 01:45.839
*

02:19.207 --> 02:20.508
I would never release

02:20.541 --> 02:23.477
a deadly gas
into a crowded arena.

02:23.511 --> 02:25.313
Actually, it's just
the VIP suites.

02:25.346 --> 02:27.581
What? You would be planning
and executing

02:27.615 --> 02:30.218
a sarin gas attack
on the VIP suites.

02:30.251 --> 02:31.852
That's the game.

02:31.885 --> 02:34.488
You're not
helping yourself here, Earl.

02:34.522 --> 02:36.957
I-It's a simulation.
A-A test of security.

02:36.990 --> 02:40.728
Intelligence chatter
mentioned something about

02:40.761 --> 02:42.430
terror groups with sarin.

02:42.463 --> 02:44.232
So I hire thinkers

02:44.265 --> 02:47.301
to brainstorm
and carry out plans

02:47.335 --> 02:49.603
to identify our weaknesses.

02:49.637 --> 02:51.939
You'll be providing
a great service

02:51.972 --> 02:53.707
to the Department
of Homeland Security.

02:53.741 --> 02:56.477
Earl, how many
think tank operations

02:56.510 --> 02:59.313
have you executed in
the past few years?

02:59.347 --> 03:01.282
20-ish.

03:01.315 --> 03:04.385
And I've turned you
down 20-ish times.

03:04.418 --> 03:06.787
You're one of the best minds
in criminology.

03:06.820 --> 03:08.522
You're perfect.

03:08.556 --> 03:12.360
And I never get tired
of hearing that.

03:12.393 --> 03:13.794
I'll see you...

03:14.828 --> 03:15.796
...at church.

03:15.829 --> 03:17.531
Oh...

03:17.565 --> 03:19.333
Abby, please.

03:19.367 --> 03:21.669
My first two thinkers have
confirmed, but my third--

03:21.702 --> 03:23.804
she called me this morning
and-and canceled.

03:23.837 --> 03:25.673
She got stuck in the Himalayas

03:25.706 --> 03:28.642
researching superhuman monks.

03:28.676 --> 03:31.412
Really. She's a Harvard
divinity professor.

03:31.445 --> 03:32.813
Brilliant.

03:32.846 --> 03:35.549
But she's nothing
compared to you.

03:35.583 --> 03:38.286
See, you have fought terror.

03:38.319 --> 03:40.488
Who better to create it?

03:40.521 --> 03:43.557
You're gonna have to
find someone else.

03:43.591 --> 03:45.526
It's too late.
Why?

03:45.559 --> 03:48.362
The concert's in two days
and we've hit a dead end.

03:48.396 --> 03:49.963
Without you...

03:49.997 --> 03:52.300
I'm gonna have to scrap
the whole thing.

03:54.468 --> 03:58.306
Earl, I can't be a bad guy.

03:58.339 --> 03:59.973
Even if it's just pretend.

04:01.942 --> 04:02.976
Sorry.

04:03.010 --> 04:04.745
That's Earl Goddard.

04:04.778 --> 04:05.979
QUINN:
Friend of yours?

04:06.013 --> 04:07.581
BISHOP:
No, I wish. I...

04:07.615 --> 04:08.982
I've written him,
like, a dozen essays

04:09.016 --> 04:10.384
trying to get his attention.

04:10.418 --> 04:11.719
We really should have a talk.

04:11.752 --> 04:13.454
He's with
Homeland Investigations.

04:13.487 --> 04:15.589
Runs their think tank
operations.

04:15.623 --> 04:17.057
They get the best
good guys to figure out

04:17.090 --> 04:18.592
what the best bad guys would do.

04:18.626 --> 04:20.894
It's like
the ultimate chess game.

04:20.928 --> 04:22.663
I-I'd kill to join.
You know,

04:22.696 --> 04:23.931
Abby gets recruited
for those all the time.

04:23.964 --> 04:24.932
She what?

04:24.965 --> 04:25.999
Yep.
I mean,

04:26.033 --> 04:28.536
yeah, no, that makes,
that makes perfect sense.

04:28.569 --> 04:30.904
Don't worry, I-I
always turn him down.

04:30.938 --> 04:33.507
You what?
I could put a good
word in for you...

04:33.541 --> 04:35.008
Really?

04:35.042 --> 04:37.778
Thanks. Wait,
why would you turn him down?

04:37.811 --> 04:39.947
I mean, wouldn't you want
to help save the world?

04:39.980 --> 04:40.948
TORRES:
Abby, don't give in.

04:40.981 --> 04:43.351
Living on the dark side's
not for everybody.

04:43.384 --> 04:44.918
It can get to you.

04:44.952 --> 04:47.621
Especially when you realize
how easy it is to be bad.

04:47.655 --> 04:48.822
Oh, man, it's depressing.

04:48.856 --> 04:50.758
Exhausting.
But wickedly exciting.

04:50.791 --> 04:51.925
I miss it so much.

04:51.959 --> 04:54.562
ABBY:
And therein lies the problem.

04:54.595 --> 04:55.763
What if I enjoyed it?

04:55.796 --> 04:57.431
Well, you should.
I mean,

04:57.465 --> 04:59.066
what's more exciting
than a terror attack?

04:59.099 --> 05:00.634
We really should have a talk.

05:00.668 --> 05:03.003
A fake terror attack.

05:03.036 --> 05:04.405
I would still feel guilty.

05:04.438 --> 05:05.673
But the danger's not real.

05:05.706 --> 05:06.907
It is.

05:06.940 --> 05:08.676
To Abby.
REEVES: Right.

05:08.709 --> 05:10.711
A jumpy security guard
sees Abby with a bomb,

05:10.744 --> 05:12.746
she might not have time
to explain that it's fake.

05:12.780 --> 05:14.648
Yeah, but they use
safety protocols.

05:14.682 --> 05:16.717
Look, it takes a certain
twisted personality

05:16.750 --> 05:19.019
to think like a killer.
Abby doesn't have it.

05:19.052 --> 05:20.854
Excuse me?
No, I mean it as a compliment.

05:20.888 --> 05:23.624
Unless...
Evil Abby really exists?

05:23.657 --> 05:25.826
I would rather not find out.

05:26.894 --> 05:29.029
Good work requires good people.

05:29.062 --> 05:30.798
VANCE:
Yeah, that's what Homeland said.

05:32.065 --> 05:33.534
Director.

05:33.567 --> 05:34.802
They called you?

05:34.835 --> 05:36.604
Begged is more like it.

05:36.637 --> 05:38.706
My NCIS caseload is...

05:38.739 --> 05:40.474
Is now empty.

05:40.508 --> 05:42.376
These operations are very
important to the higher-ups.

05:42.410 --> 05:43.611
Including me.

05:43.644 --> 05:44.978
Wait, wait.

05:45.012 --> 05:46.447
Is that an order?

05:46.480 --> 05:48.716
Yes. Go be a bad guy.

05:48.749 --> 05:50.350
Lucky.

05:51.552 --> 05:53.687
ABBY:
Aristotle banana split.

05:53.721 --> 05:54.888
Stop saying that.

05:54.922 --> 05:56.657
Gibbs. NCIS.

05:56.690 --> 05:58.559
Listen, the only reason
you and I are still talking

05:58.592 --> 06:00.794
is because the bomb squad
said that your little bomb

06:00.828 --> 06:02.830
was clock timers stuck
in modeling clay.

06:02.863 --> 06:04.698
So you want to tell me
what the hell's going on?

06:04.732 --> 06:06.133
Aristotle banana split.

06:06.166 --> 06:07.701
Hey, Abbs.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.872
Gibbs. NCIS.

06:11.905 --> 06:13.941
See, now those are the only two
words that this woman has said

06:13.974 --> 06:15.108
that make any sense.

06:15.142 --> 06:16.844
So I called you
here to explain.

06:16.877 --> 06:18.579
Okay.

06:18.612 --> 06:19.747
Why hasn't she?

06:19.780 --> 06:22.450
Because in the event
that I got caught,

06:22.483 --> 06:24.718
I'm only supposed to use
the safety phrase,

06:24.752 --> 06:26.454
"Aristotle banana split."

06:26.487 --> 06:28.121
MCGINLEY: Except
nobody in the arena,

06:28.155 --> 06:30.724
or human history,
has ever heard that before.

06:30.758 --> 06:33.594
It's supposed to prove that
I'm working with Homeland

06:33.627 --> 06:35.829
to test the arena security.

06:35.863 --> 06:38.499
This is a simulation.
Is that true?

06:38.532 --> 06:40.634
Mm-hmm.
Well, somebody screwed up.

06:40.668 --> 06:42.603
This is the first I'm hearing
of this. We had to evacuate

06:42.636 --> 06:43.604
the whole damn building.

06:43.637 --> 06:44.872
How'd you get caught?

06:44.905 --> 06:45.973
She tripped a motion sensor.

06:46.006 --> 06:46.974
No way.

06:47.007 --> 06:48.742
I studied the blueprints.

06:48.776 --> 06:50.444
I didn't fail.

06:50.478 --> 06:52.480
Well, I think you're missing
the bigger problem here.

06:52.513 --> 06:55.449
What exactly was this,
uh, simulated plan?

06:55.483 --> 06:56.750
Detonate balloons

06:56.784 --> 06:58.886
that are supposedly
full of deadly gas

06:58.919 --> 07:00.754
into the air vents.

07:00.788 --> 07:02.055
But it was all fake.

07:02.089 --> 07:03.123
And pretty damn evil.

07:03.156 --> 07:04.858
I was ordered to do it.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.828
I need to make
a phone call.

07:07.861 --> 07:09.530
Can you take off my handcuffs?

07:09.563 --> 07:12.500
MAN:
Live ordinates coming through!

07:12.533 --> 07:14.034
Open buffer...

07:14.935 --> 07:17.471
Lock it down!

07:17.505 --> 07:19.072
Move!
Pressurizing!

07:19.106 --> 07:21.108
(Abby gasps)

07:21.141 --> 07:23.744
All clear!

07:25.513 --> 07:26.814
OFFICER:
What the hell?

07:26.847 --> 07:28.248
Your fake bomb

07:28.281 --> 07:30.017
just made a real explosion.

07:40.027 --> 07:42.062
I'm not a terrorist.

07:42.095 --> 07:44.498
I don't think.

07:44.532 --> 07:46.634
Abby.
McGee, finally.

07:46.667 --> 07:48.636
What is happening?
They won't tell me anything.

07:48.669 --> 07:51.138
It's not good.
This is my nightmare.

07:51.171 --> 07:54.675
The only thing missing is Vance
riding in on demon wings

07:54.708 --> 07:57.277
to fire me.
Well, that makes sense.

07:57.310 --> 07:58.846
I usually wake up
when his moustache

07:58.879 --> 08:00.714
turns into a snake.
Well, this ain't a dream.

08:00.748 --> 08:02.983
McGEE: When the bomb squad
removed the third explosive,

08:03.016 --> 08:04.685
they found C-4 hidden inside.

08:04.718 --> 08:05.986
What about the balloons?

08:06.019 --> 08:08.255
They all contained several drops

08:08.288 --> 08:09.723
of liquid sarin.

08:11.124 --> 08:12.560
Hardly noticeable.

08:12.593 --> 08:13.961
But enough to kill hundreds

08:13.994 --> 08:16.129
of people if it was
exposed to air.

08:16.163 --> 08:17.565
Hence the biohazard team.

08:17.598 --> 08:19.733
We've been double-crossed.

08:19.767 --> 08:21.201
Someone used the think tank.

08:21.234 --> 08:23.003
And I plan to find out who.

08:23.036 --> 08:24.738
Director, is this our case?

08:24.772 --> 08:25.973
It is now.

08:26.006 --> 08:27.575
We'll coordinate with Homeland.

08:27.608 --> 08:29.610
I just fought with Metro
for custody of Miss Sciuto.

08:31.311 --> 08:33.080
Custody, like...

08:33.113 --> 08:35.248
Guantanamo?
No, Hardly.

08:35.282 --> 08:37.718
I'm the one that told you to
do this in the first place.

08:37.751 --> 08:39.620
Could we please remove
these handcuffs?

08:39.653 --> 08:40.988
Where the hell
is Earl Goddard?

08:41.021 --> 08:42.690
I have no idea.

08:42.723 --> 08:43.857
Still hasn't
answered our calls.

08:43.891 --> 08:45.092
We were gonna
search the arena.

08:45.125 --> 08:46.760
Go.

08:46.794 --> 08:49.029
Wait, what time is it?

08:49.062 --> 08:51.231
The team

08:51.264 --> 08:53.834
was supposed to meet
Earl back at his hotel room

08:53.867 --> 08:55.535
to debrief after the operation.

08:57.204 --> 08:59.707
BISHOP:
Your team stayed here?

08:59.740 --> 09:01.074
No, we all had own rooms,

09:01.108 --> 09:03.844
but Earl's room was like
our base of operations.

09:03.877 --> 09:05.312
While you planned
the attack?

09:05.345 --> 09:07.781
We had no idea someone was gonna
try to make it real.

09:07.815 --> 09:09.650
Think that was the point?
Take back my excitement.

09:09.683 --> 09:11.652
We trusted each other.

09:11.685 --> 09:13.721
Sarin is so unrealistic.

09:13.754 --> 09:15.956
Will you stop pacing
and enjoy the food?

09:15.989 --> 09:19.326
Our records don't show you
as a vegetarian, Mr. Axiom.

09:19.359 --> 09:20.861
Well, I just started
this morning.

09:20.894 --> 09:23.931
I woke up with a vision and gas.

09:23.964 --> 09:26.867
That's why I picked you.
'Cause I have acid reflux?

09:26.900 --> 09:29.102
No, you're the
wild card. Abby?

09:29.136 --> 09:31.939
Meet John James Axiom,
film director.

09:31.972 --> 09:34.675
We met when he was
researching a spy thriller.

09:34.708 --> 09:36.810
He's really good with story,
sees the whole picture.

09:36.844 --> 09:38.712
Even if no one
goes to see his.

09:38.746 --> 09:41.114
How much did your
last movie make?
EARL: Greta "Fensternackt."

09:41.148 --> 09:44.151
Fensternacht.
She's a researcher
with the CDC.

09:44.184 --> 09:46.854
If there's any fault in
our plan, she will find it.

09:46.887 --> 09:49.356
Like bringing in a new recruit
in the middle of an operation?

09:49.389 --> 09:51.391
And without
the proper paperwork.

09:51.424 --> 09:53.994
Earl, I'm assuming she signed
our non-disclosure agreement.

09:54.027 --> 09:56.630
Homeland Logistics Manager,
Phil Kurjak.

09:56.664 --> 09:58.031
My right hand.

09:58.065 --> 09:59.232
He's in charge of, uh,

09:59.266 --> 10:00.901
anything the three
of you may need.

10:00.934 --> 10:02.269
KURJAK:
Within a government budget.

10:02.302 --> 10:04.838
This isn't Pacific Clash 2.

10:04.872 --> 10:06.640
Inflated budget
is the only reason

10:06.674 --> 10:08.108
that movie didn't make money.

10:08.141 --> 10:10.110
It exploited gender stereotypes.

10:10.143 --> 10:12.112
The lead female
killed the bad guy!

10:12.145 --> 10:14.281
With a lap dance.
GODDARD: Enough!

10:14.314 --> 10:17.885
I'd like for you all to meet
NCIS Forensic Scientist

10:17.918 --> 10:20.754
Abby Sciuto.
Crime-fighter

10:20.788 --> 10:22.756
and positive thinker
extraordinaire.

10:22.790 --> 10:24.291
Terrific.

10:24.324 --> 10:27.194
Well, this group could use
some positive energy.

10:27.227 --> 10:30.731
Unless, while I was gone,
you found a way to release

10:30.764 --> 10:32.800
sarin into that arena
without getting caught.

10:32.833 --> 10:34.935
It's impossible. I've done
enough of your think tank ops

10:34.968 --> 10:36.937
to know. Security measures
are too tight.

10:36.970 --> 10:39.406
Especially
on the VIP suite level.

10:39.439 --> 10:41.875
What about the ventilation
system? It looks vulnerable.

10:41.909 --> 10:43.310
We killed that idea
two hours ago.

10:43.343 --> 10:44.745
It's too complicated.

10:44.778 --> 10:45.312
We'll get caught.

10:45.345 --> 10:48.048
No.

10:48.081 --> 10:50.450
Not if we trust each other.

10:50.483 --> 10:53.754
(scoffs)
I'm serious.

10:53.787 --> 10:56.156
I'm not gonna go into
the arena with a fake bomb

10:56.189 --> 10:58.225
unless I know
my team has my back.

10:58.258 --> 11:00.093
Who said anything about bombs?

11:00.127 --> 11:02.295
A synchronized release?

11:02.329 --> 11:03.931
Small explosives.

11:03.964 --> 11:06.466
Just enough to propel
the gas into the arena.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.902
FENSTERNACHT:
That's...

11:08.936 --> 11:09.870
pretty evil.

11:11.138 --> 11:12.405
I like it.

11:12.439 --> 11:16.176
So how do we get
past security?

11:16.209 --> 11:17.745
ABBY:
That...

11:17.778 --> 11:18.946
I don't know.

11:18.979 --> 11:20.447
Yet.

11:22.115 --> 11:24.952
Don't worry.
I'm sure Earl will explain...

11:24.985 --> 11:26.453
everything.

11:26.486 --> 11:29.022
Earl?

11:29.056 --> 11:32.292
Hello? Earl?

11:32.325 --> 11:35.295
Empty. No suitcases.

11:35.328 --> 11:39.032
Did you check the-the bathroom
or...?

11:39.066 --> 11:42.502
(exhales) Well, the hotel
said Earl checked out.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.371
All right, well, give me
the names of your team, Abby.

11:44.404 --> 11:45.338
I'll get started
on the BOLOs.

11:47.340 --> 11:50.110
That won't be necessary.

11:52.545 --> 11:53.814
ABBY:
Hey, guys.

11:53.847 --> 11:54.714
Abby,

11:54.748 --> 11:56.049
what the hell happened?
We did our jobs

11:56.083 --> 11:57.317
and came back here
to wait for you.

11:57.350 --> 11:59.052
It's been two hours.
I got caught.

11:59.086 --> 12:00.520
I knew this wouldn't work.
QUINN: No, it did work.

12:00.553 --> 12:01.955
Too well.
Yeah, the sarin

12:01.989 --> 12:03.323
and one of your
bombs was real.

12:03.356 --> 12:04.491
What?
That's impossible.

12:04.524 --> 12:06.960
We got played.
Where is Earl?

12:06.994 --> 12:09.062
Nobody's seen him
since the operation began.

12:09.096 --> 12:10.363
When he went
to the arena.

12:10.397 --> 12:12.065
To do what?
Let the head
of security know

12:12.099 --> 12:13.400
the operation was happening
tonight and give them

12:13.433 --> 12:14.534
the safe phrase.

12:14.567 --> 12:16.203
Well, that never happened.

12:16.236 --> 12:17.504
He set us up.

12:17.537 --> 12:19.139
Earl would never do that.
(phone ringing)

12:19.172 --> 12:20.740
QUINN:
Yeah, Gibbs.

12:21.541 --> 12:23.510
Yeah. Okay.

12:23.543 --> 12:26.479
Well, uh, we found Earl Goddard.

12:26.513 --> 12:28.982
Oh, good. (exhales)
What did Earl say?

12:32.152 --> 12:33.386
TORRES:
Arena security found the van

12:33.420 --> 12:35.155
and saw the body
through the window.

12:35.188 --> 12:36.990
Are these suits
really necessary?

12:37.024 --> 12:38.458
Yes.

12:40.427 --> 12:42.429
Unless you want
to risk instant death

12:42.462 --> 12:44.164
by exposure to sarin.

12:44.197 --> 12:45.532
Sarin?

12:45.565 --> 12:47.167
The suits are awesome.

12:58.578 --> 13:01.281
The vehicle and body have been
cleared for active sarin.

13:01.314 --> 13:03.817
Well, until we can find
the source, I will arrange

13:03.851 --> 13:06.086
a biohazard tent
in the evidence garage.

13:06.119 --> 13:08.588
Why don't you go home,
get a couple hours' sleep.

13:08.621 --> 13:11.491
Got coffee, Leon.
Who needs sleep?

13:11.524 --> 13:13.126
Well, here's somebody
who's had a full night's rest.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.395
Director Vance.

13:15.428 --> 13:18.131
Good morning.
Knox, I was
expecting you sooner.

13:18.165 --> 13:20.267
I talked to your director
last night.
So was I.

13:20.300 --> 13:21.334
But he gave NCIS the lead,

13:21.368 --> 13:23.370
and I was told to stand down.

13:23.403 --> 13:24.972
Special Agent Gibbs,

13:25.005 --> 13:26.874
Knox Ellicott,
Homeland Operations.

13:26.907 --> 13:28.375
(scoffs)
This is crazy.

13:28.408 --> 13:30.978
Earl's been reporting to me
for ten years without a problem.

13:31.011 --> 13:32.345
Now it's looking
like he was the problem.

13:32.379 --> 13:35.082
Earl? Target an arena?
No. No way.

13:35.115 --> 13:37.250
Somebody just piggybacked on
our op to make a statement.

13:37.284 --> 13:39.052
Then Earl
missed something.

13:39.086 --> 13:41.388
Namely real explosives
and real sarin.

13:41.421 --> 13:43.156
It's easy to blame the dead.

13:43.190 --> 13:45.258
Somebody put one of my people
in danger.

13:45.292 --> 13:47.294
And Earl was one of my people.

13:47.327 --> 13:50.097
Look elsewhere.

13:50.130 --> 13:52.265
While he was always a good judge
of talent, he could be

13:52.299 --> 13:54.401
a little too forgiving
when it came to character.

13:54.434 --> 13:58.105
Gibbs, this coffee
is a little too hot.

14:00.607 --> 14:03.944
Your agents should question
his think tank team.

14:03.977 --> 14:05.178
We are.

14:05.212 --> 14:06.479
QUINN:
Logistics manager.

14:06.513 --> 14:07.915
What is that?

14:07.948 --> 14:09.349
I facilitate the team.

14:09.382 --> 14:12.552
Research, supplies, payment.

14:12.585 --> 14:14.888
But I don't go on the actual
field exercise itself.

14:14.922 --> 14:16.423
So where were you last night
then?

14:16.456 --> 14:18.558
I stayed behind
to pack up the hotel room.

14:18.591 --> 14:20.894
Is that why it was empty?

14:20.928 --> 14:22.329
Earl and I both live locally.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.231
No need for another night.
Frugal.

14:24.264 --> 14:25.132
I'm good at my job.

14:28.969 --> 14:31.471
MBA from Missouri.
Average GPA.

14:31.504 --> 14:33.106
No prior career experience.

14:33.140 --> 14:36.109
Yet Earl recruited you.

14:36.143 --> 14:37.110
Why?

14:37.144 --> 14:38.045
We met at a job fair.

14:38.078 --> 14:40.213
He has a knack for people,
and we clicked.

14:43.083 --> 14:46.586
My parents were killed
in Bosnia in '93.

14:46.619 --> 14:49.122
I grew up in St. Louis
with my grandmother.

14:49.156 --> 14:52.125
And I'm telling you this,

14:52.159 --> 14:55.462
because Earl was the closest
thing I had to a father.

14:57.197 --> 14:57.998
He didn't do it.

14:58.031 --> 15:00.000
Well, Earl

15:00.033 --> 15:03.270
was ultimately responsible
for their safety.

15:03.303 --> 15:06.173
So let's start
with the explosives.

15:07.707 --> 15:11.144
They only had to look real
for the war game to be fair.

15:11.178 --> 15:13.346
Otherwise, we might as well be
smuggling fruitcake.

15:13.380 --> 15:16.549
But Earl never had any real
bomb parts at the hotel.

15:16.583 --> 15:18.318
But he was in charge
of making them, huh?

15:21.321 --> 15:23.090
ABBY: Remember, the
explosives should not

15:23.123 --> 15:24.357
be large.
FENSTERNACHT: Right.

15:24.391 --> 15:27.427
If a terrorist is smart enough
to get their hands on sarin--

15:27.460 --> 15:29.696
which is very unrealistic--
Tell that
to our security analysts.

15:29.729 --> 15:31.164
then they're
smart enough

15:31.198 --> 15:32.699
not to destroy it
in the explosion.

15:32.732 --> 15:34.334
GODDARD: I'll worry
about the props.

15:34.367 --> 15:36.503
You just worry
about getting past security.

15:36.536 --> 15:40.040
In order to minimize
our individual exposure,

15:40.073 --> 15:42.375
I think we should each be
responsible for one task.

15:42.409 --> 15:44.477
It's clean, easy to follow.

15:44.511 --> 15:46.246
Unlike the plot
of Alien Carnival.

15:46.279 --> 15:47.547
Watch the director's cut.

15:48.681 --> 15:49.983
JJ is right, okay?

15:50.017 --> 15:52.719
And I've been working on a plan.

15:52.752 --> 15:55.288
An Evil Abby plan.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.258
Ta-da!

15:58.291 --> 15:59.526
It requires

15:59.559 --> 16:00.427
balloons

16:00.460 --> 16:02.996
and makeup and Caf-POW!

16:03.030 --> 16:05.432
Lots and lots
and lots of Caf-POW!

16:06.599 --> 16:08.268
What kind of terrorist are you?

16:08.301 --> 16:09.536
ABBY:
The kind

16:09.569 --> 16:11.338
that doesn't get caught.

16:11.371 --> 16:13.240
McGEE: So this whole thing
was Abby's idea?

16:13.273 --> 16:14.674
No. We should all get credit.

16:14.707 --> 16:16.476
And can we wrap this up?

16:16.509 --> 16:18.078
I have a meeting
in L.A. tomorrow.

16:18.111 --> 16:20.313
I'd rather not
cancel on Johnny.

16:20.347 --> 16:22.382
Depp.
He starred in my first film.

16:22.415 --> 16:26.753
Yes. The only one that saw
critical and financial success.

16:26.786 --> 16:28.321
But what was that,
ten years ago?

16:28.355 --> 16:31.058
Look, you write
great concepts, okay?

16:31.091 --> 16:32.259
I mean,
that's why Earl recruited you

16:32.292 --> 16:34.194
in the first place. But...

16:34.227 --> 16:36.729
your films fail to connect
with audiences.

16:36.763 --> 16:39.332
Okay, Siskel,
so what's your point?

16:39.366 --> 16:41.201
Do you have
money troubles?

16:41.234 --> 16:44.037
Someone pay you to sabotage
the think tank operation?

16:44.071 --> 16:46.439
(chuckles) And people say
my plots are dense.

16:46.473 --> 16:48.375
All right, look,
everyone was given a task

16:48.408 --> 16:50.477
the night of the attack.
What was yours?

16:50.510 --> 16:53.646
To get the explosives into the
arena after the concert started.

16:53.680 --> 16:55.282
Who gave 'em to you?
Earl.

16:55.315 --> 16:58.285
Sure, it was Abby's idea
to use the Caf-POW!,

16:58.318 --> 17:01.688
but the plan only worked because
my performance was Oscar-worthy.

17:02.689 --> 17:05.292
Or at least a Golden Globe.

17:12.332 --> 17:13.366
Hey, mate.

17:13.400 --> 17:14.401
Can I help you?

17:14.434 --> 17:17.404
Yeah. I messed up. Bad.

17:17.437 --> 17:21.408
I made a delivery this morning
and I shorted you three cases.

17:21.441 --> 17:24.144
And you want me to call who?
Oh, no, I just need

17:24.177 --> 17:25.512
to get this stuff inside.

17:25.545 --> 17:27.414
See, your concessions
manager is gonna do a count

17:27.447 --> 17:28.848
at the end of the night.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.717
Every one of these bottles
not in that arena

17:30.750 --> 17:32.185
is a bottle they can't sell.

17:32.219 --> 17:33.820
And they're gonna charge me.

17:33.853 --> 17:36.689
I mean, eight bucks a pop
times three cases.

17:36.723 --> 17:38.591
That's enough to keep
my daughter in preschool

17:38.625 --> 17:39.826
for a month.

17:42.229 --> 17:44.731
You like this stuff?

17:46.466 --> 17:48.835
Here, take a few.
My treat.

17:48.868 --> 17:51.438
Trying to bribe your way
into a free concert?

17:51.471 --> 17:53.440
Come on, mate.

17:53.473 --> 17:56.376
I'll be in and out
in two minutes. I promise.

17:56.409 --> 17:58.145
Please,

17:58.178 --> 17:59.546
for me daughter.

18:12.392 --> 18:15.362
Hey. Took you long enough.
Greta?

18:15.395 --> 18:17.864
(chuckling):
Oh, you look amazing.

18:17.897 --> 18:19.432
I feel stupid.

18:19.466 --> 18:22.402
I got to get back
to the loading dock.

18:26.639 --> 18:27.674
See you at the hotel.

18:27.707 --> 18:29.809
All right.

18:39.586 --> 18:40.787
That outfit was hideous.

18:40.820 --> 18:41.854
But that was part
of Abby's plan.

18:41.888 --> 18:44.224
Whoa. Our plan.

18:44.257 --> 18:46.793
My job was to plant the bomb.
Abby just came up with the idea

18:46.826 --> 18:49.329
of making me a lost groupie.
But that wasn't good enough.

18:49.362 --> 18:50.597
So I went on eBay

18:50.630 --> 18:52.165
and found
a backstage pass.

18:52.199 --> 18:53.566
It only worked because of me.

18:53.600 --> 18:54.467
You?

18:55.402 --> 18:56.536
Wearing Abby's boots?

18:57.604 --> 19:00.207
I prefer comfort over style.

19:00.240 --> 19:01.508
And why not?
We're all gonna die anyway.

19:01.541 --> 19:02.709
Exactly.

19:02.742 --> 19:04.244
Wait, what?

19:04.277 --> 19:05.512
Your words.

19:05.545 --> 19:08.515
I read some of your, uh,
research papers.

19:08.548 --> 19:11.518
Dark stuff.
Working with the world's
most heinous diseases

19:11.551 --> 19:13.853
has shown me the futility
of life's struggles.

19:13.886 --> 19:15.588
So maybe you wanted
to end it all.

19:15.622 --> 19:16.923
Take a few hundred people
with you.

19:16.956 --> 19:18.191
I didn't make the attack real.

19:18.225 --> 19:19.926
I'm pessimistic, not homicidal.

19:19.959 --> 19:22.695
Well, you say "tomato,"
I say "terrorist."

19:23.930 --> 19:25.665
Your work gives you access
to sarin.

19:25.698 --> 19:27.267
Yes.

19:27.300 --> 19:29.402
But Homeland oversees
a dozen lab facilities.

19:29.436 --> 19:30.937
Earl had access.

19:30.970 --> 19:32.805
And what about Abby?

19:32.839 --> 19:33.940
Evil Abby?

19:33.973 --> 19:35.775
Her security clearance
is high enough.

19:37.444 --> 19:38.811
She's the one
who labeled the bombs.

19:38.845 --> 19:40.813
I was just following
her instructions.

19:40.847 --> 19:43.750
You know,
if she's gonna take the credit,

19:43.783 --> 19:46.586
she should take the blame.

19:48.421 --> 19:52.392
FYI, I think
her whole Goth thing

19:52.425 --> 19:53.960
is really just a cry for help.

19:53.993 --> 19:55.895
ABBY:
Greta said what?

19:55.928 --> 19:58.698
I'm... I'm not a Goth.

19:58.731 --> 20:01.534
I am feeling a little bit
naked without my choker on.

20:01.568 --> 20:02.702
Can I go home and change
after this?

20:02.735 --> 20:03.503
Are you sure you don't want

20:03.536 --> 20:04.704
to do this
in the conference room?

20:04.737 --> 20:05.705
No. No!

20:05.738 --> 20:06.706
No special treatment.

20:06.739 --> 20:07.974
I am just as guilty.

20:08.007 --> 20:09.976
No.

20:11.544 --> 20:12.912
So this whole thing
was your idea?

20:12.945 --> 20:15.782
Evil Abby was smart, Gibbs.

20:15.815 --> 20:17.984
I'm not proud of it.
Someone used you.

20:18.017 --> 20:19.386
It was not Earl.

20:19.419 --> 20:21.288
He gave you the balloons.
Yes.

20:21.321 --> 20:23.523
He left them for me
in the hotel room.

20:23.556 --> 20:25.292
That was your task?
Yes.

20:25.325 --> 20:27.394
A flower delivery
to the band's dressing room.

20:27.427 --> 20:29.996
I had this-this logo made

20:30.029 --> 20:32.332
And I'm friends with
the Sterile Puppets' drummer,

20:32.365 --> 20:34.534
and he said that,
that bands get gifts

20:34.567 --> 20:38.004
delivered from-from fans and
local businesses all the time.

20:38.037 --> 20:40.840
Yes. Security scans packages.
Yes, and then they,

20:40.873 --> 20:42.975
they swab them for anything
that's illegal or dangerous,

20:43.009 --> 20:45.278
so I had to think
outside the box, you know?

20:45.312 --> 20:46.979
Balloons.
They don't set off

20:47.013 --> 20:48.348
metal detectors.

20:48.381 --> 20:50.483
If someone were
to X-ray them, then...

20:50.517 --> 20:52.852
the small amount of liquid
would never show up.

20:52.885 --> 20:55.755
Security didn't suspect
anything.

20:55.788 --> 20:58.358
(sighs)

20:58.391 --> 21:00.360
Forgive me, Gibbs. I've sinned.

21:00.393 --> 21:01.494
It's not your fault.

21:01.528 --> 21:03.796
Yeah, but, you know,
at the time,

21:03.830 --> 21:06.065
it was, like, fun, you know?

21:06.098 --> 21:08.735
I had fun.

21:09.936 --> 21:12.572
Maybe 'cause of that,
I-I missed something.

21:12.605 --> 21:14.907
(takes deep breath)

21:14.941 --> 21:17.544
I could've killed
so many people.

21:21.881 --> 21:24.317
The chemicals used
to make liquid sarin

21:24.351 --> 21:27.820
are arguably more dangerous
than the final product.

21:27.854 --> 21:31.658
Not to mention the considerable
cost of manufacture.

21:31.691 --> 21:33.560
In 1995, in Japan,

21:33.593 --> 21:37.864
a cult spent millions
on a facility.

21:37.897 --> 21:40.400
You mind if I join you,
Dr. Ducky?

21:40.433 --> 21:42.602
Oh, by all means, Agent Reeves.

21:42.635 --> 21:44.937
Yeah, I was just explaining
to our friend here

21:44.971 --> 21:49.342
that despite the claims
of certain foreign powers,

21:49.376 --> 21:52.011
liquid sarin cannot be made
in the kitchen.

21:52.044 --> 21:53.946
Abby says mere drops
can be deadly.

21:53.980 --> 21:58.418
Yeah, the liquid evaporates
when it's exposed to the air.

21:58.451 --> 22:00.687
Direct inhalation
can cause a buildup

22:00.720 --> 22:03.456
of acetylcholine
in the nervous system.

22:03.490 --> 22:05.558
The body can shut down,

22:05.592 --> 22:07.026
mm, in under a minute.

22:07.059 --> 22:08.828
Nasty business.
Yeah.

22:08.861 --> 22:10.897
Do you come from Brumarket?

22:12.865 --> 22:14.667
Uh, your accent.

22:14.701 --> 22:16.969
Did you grow up in Birmingham?

22:17.003 --> 22:18.705
That sounds like judgment.

22:18.738 --> 22:21.040
No, no, no.
I thought your last
name was Mallard,

22:21.073 --> 22:23.109
not Higgins.
Shaw's Pygmalion.

22:23.142 --> 22:24.110
You know it?

22:24.143 --> 22:26.613
Practically my biography.

22:26.646 --> 22:28.948
Although I do prefer
My Fair Lady.

22:28.981 --> 22:31.050
(chuckles)
Are you a fan of musicals?

22:31.083 --> 22:33.586
No, no. Audrey Hepburn.

22:33.620 --> 22:35.021
Mm.
Although I think

22:35.054 --> 22:36.956
we should stick
to the case at hand.

22:36.989 --> 22:38.491
Yes, let's.

22:38.525 --> 22:40.560
I can confirm

22:40.593 --> 22:42.862
the cause of death.

22:42.895 --> 22:44.731
Sarin poisoning.
Yes.

22:44.764 --> 22:47.967
But the only sarin residue
is around his mouth.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.969
Did he drink it? Suicide?

22:50.002 --> 22:52.038
We found fibers in his throat,

22:52.071 --> 22:55.842
and there are these bruises
around his neck.

22:55.875 --> 22:57.977
Well, if the fibers
are from a towel or rag,

22:58.010 --> 22:59.879
it could mean
he was grabbed by the neck

22:59.912 --> 23:01.748
and sarin held in his mouth.

23:01.781 --> 23:04.617
Well, final analysis will have
to wait till Ms. Sciuto

23:04.651 --> 23:06.619
returns to her lab.

23:06.653 --> 23:08.521
But if this was murder,

23:08.555 --> 23:10.189
Earl could be innocent.

23:10.222 --> 23:11.758
Or he wasn't working alone.

23:11.791 --> 23:13.159
Right.

23:13.192 --> 23:15.628
Ta-ra, then, Doctor.

23:15.662 --> 23:17.730
T.T.F.N.

23:17.764 --> 23:20.900
To the uninitiated,
that means

23:20.933 --> 23:22.902
Ta-Ta For Now.

23:22.935 --> 23:25.104
(chuckles)

23:26.172 --> 23:27.774
Ellie. You called me.

23:27.807 --> 23:29.542
Yeah. Uh,
I finished with the van

23:29.576 --> 23:31.010
and found Earl's laptop.

23:31.043 --> 23:33.079
It's password-protected,
but McGee can handle it.

23:33.112 --> 23:34.781
Okay. What's the problem?

23:34.814 --> 23:36.215
Well, it's what
I didn't find.

23:36.248 --> 23:37.950
No more sarin.

23:37.984 --> 23:40.920
What, that's a bad thing?
Yes. Because of this.

23:40.953 --> 23:43.556
Looks like it was peeled
off of a lab container.

23:43.590 --> 23:45.658
15 cc's is like

23:45.692 --> 23:47.660
a bottle of nail
polish, but...

23:47.694 --> 23:49.929
it's enough sarin
to fill this room.

23:49.962 --> 23:51.664
How much was in the balloons?

23:51.698 --> 23:54.100
Drops. And it wouldn't have
taken much to kill Earl.

23:55.167 --> 23:56.536
That's a lot left over.

23:56.569 --> 23:58.070
Enough to kill hundreds.

24:11.217 --> 24:13.920
Update on our
current case?

24:13.953 --> 24:15.888
Right. Yes.

24:22.194 --> 24:26.132
A Homeland think tank was asked
to execute a fake terror attack.

24:26.165 --> 24:28.535
To test security.
Except the attack
wasn't so fake.

24:28.568 --> 24:30.202
REEVES: Someone switched out
a bomb, put real sarin

24:30.236 --> 24:32.972
in the balloons and killed
Special Agent Earl Goddard.

24:33.005 --> 24:35.775
Yeah, they used the think tank
to do all the planning

24:35.808 --> 24:38.811
and the dirty work.
Like cheating off the smart girl
during a math exam.

24:38.845 --> 24:40.112
But why?

24:40.146 --> 24:42.815
Because she's cute
and I hate math.

24:42.849 --> 24:44.684
No. I mean why
a sarin attack?

24:44.717 --> 24:46.619
Who stood to gain?
Well, whoever it is

24:46.653 --> 24:48.254
still has a vial
of the stuff.

24:48.287 --> 24:49.856
I doubt they'll
let it go to waste.

24:49.889 --> 24:52.258
Been coordinating with the NSA
and Homeland all day.

24:52.291 --> 24:54.260
Uh, Bishop.

24:54.293 --> 24:56.529
Turns out you're
on Earl's short list after all.

24:56.563 --> 24:57.997
What?
McGEE: Yep.

24:58.030 --> 24:59.198
I got into Earl's laptop--
he's got files

24:59.231 --> 25:03.069
on potential recruits, including
one Bishop, Eleanor Raye.

25:03.102 --> 25:05.605
Well, a few days ago
I would've been thrilled, but...

25:05.638 --> 25:08.007
now that he's a suspected
terrorist, not so much.

25:08.040 --> 25:11.744
Find anything else?
McGEE: It turns out Earl used
Homeland resources

25:11.778 --> 25:13.713
to tap into
the arena security network.

25:13.746 --> 25:15.615
That gave him access
to surveillance cameras.

25:15.648 --> 25:17.750
So he could observe the team
as they carry out the attack.

25:17.784 --> 25:18.985
JJ:
He was recording us.

25:19.018 --> 25:20.620
Oh, this just gets
better and better.

25:20.653 --> 25:22.589
Thanks to you,
I missed my meeting.

25:22.622 --> 25:23.756
We need you
to stay here in DC

25:23.790 --> 25:25.157
until the investigation's
complete.

25:25.191 --> 25:26.759
Well, I'm not gonna
leave the country.

25:26.793 --> 25:28.628
But Johnny rescheduled
for tomorrow,

25:28.661 --> 25:30.162
and I've got to be
at that meeting.

25:30.196 --> 25:32.164
Can't you just talk
over the phone?

25:32.198 --> 25:33.833
Actors need handholding,
all right?

25:33.866 --> 25:35.267
I'm sorry, but we need you here.

25:35.301 --> 25:37.103
Oh, this is turning
into a movie plot.

25:37.136 --> 25:38.905
Recruited
for a government operation,

25:38.938 --> 25:41.173
now a suspected criminal,
and to top it off,

25:41.207 --> 25:42.775
when I called to complain,

25:42.809 --> 25:44.310
Homeland said
they'd never heard of me.

25:44.343 --> 25:46.579
Don't they have
Earl's records?
No.

25:46.613 --> 25:49.281
I don't know if this is Alfred
Hitchcock or Howard Hawks.

25:52.885 --> 25:54.654
It's been ten minutes.

25:54.687 --> 25:57.790
Safe to come in yet?
I am... so...

25:57.824 --> 25:59.191
Mad. Yeah, you mentioned that.

25:59.225 --> 26:00.860
Super mad.

26:00.893 --> 26:04.697
I am mad at the killer
for killing my friend.

26:04.731 --> 26:09.101
And I'm mad at Director Vance
for making me join a think tank.

26:09.135 --> 26:11.704
Mostly, I'm just,
I'm mad at...

26:11.738 --> 26:13.005
me.

26:13.039 --> 26:14.273
For what, being too good?

26:14.306 --> 26:16.275
For being so good at being bad.

26:16.308 --> 26:17.944
And now I-I'm
being punished

26:17.977 --> 26:19.812
by the whole universe.

26:19.846 --> 26:20.813
I'll come back.

26:20.847 --> 26:22.882
Evil Abby was on fire!

26:22.915 --> 26:25.818
And now I'm back in my lab,
and Good Abby has

26:25.852 --> 26:28.821
nothing...
to-to solve Earl's murder

26:28.855 --> 26:31.223
or even prove
that he's innocent.

26:31.257 --> 26:32.258
We should talk later.

26:32.291 --> 26:34.260
No, I-I'm fine.

26:34.293 --> 26:35.962
What did you find?

26:35.995 --> 26:37.396
The source of the sarin.

26:37.429 --> 26:38.364
Yes!

26:38.397 --> 26:39.298
Earl stole it.

26:39.331 --> 26:41.167
No.

26:41.200 --> 26:43.035
Homeland Security report.

26:45.037 --> 26:49.642
Earl used his key card
to enter a chemical lab

26:49.676 --> 26:52.278
two days ago at 2:00 a.m.

26:52.311 --> 26:54.146
Nobody noticed
it was missing

26:54.180 --> 26:55.948
until I started
asking questions.

26:55.982 --> 26:58.985
Okay, I get that
this looks bad.

26:59.018 --> 27:00.386
Abby, this is bad.

27:00.419 --> 27:03.422
Earl was used.

27:03.455 --> 27:05.858
And Good Abby is
gonna prove that.

27:08.227 --> 27:10.663
(sighing):
I hope.

27:10.697 --> 27:11.964
Gibbs?

27:11.998 --> 27:14.166
JJ Axiom wants me
to do a screen test.

27:14.200 --> 27:15.668
(chuckles)

27:15.702 --> 27:16.903
Which is not important.

27:16.936 --> 27:18.104
Tell me what is.

27:18.137 --> 27:20.106
Homeland performed
a system wipe.

27:20.139 --> 27:23.843
It means everybody working
in Earl's department

27:23.876 --> 27:25.111
had to erase their computers.

27:25.144 --> 27:26.378
On purpose?
Yes.

27:26.412 --> 27:28.314
That's why
there's no record of JJ.

27:28.347 --> 27:31.083
A data wipe is serious and
I don't know why they did it.

27:31.117 --> 27:32.151
Ask Homeland.

27:32.184 --> 27:33.219
I tried.

27:33.252 --> 27:34.353
But the wipe was ordered

27:34.386 --> 27:36.923
by Operations Director
Knox Ellicott,

27:36.956 --> 27:38.324
but he's been dodging my calls.

27:38.357 --> 27:39.391
When did he order it?

27:39.425 --> 27:41.260
Last night.
After the murder?

27:42.228 --> 27:44.831
Get him in here.

27:44.864 --> 27:46.766
ELLICOTT: I'm sorry
about the missed calls.

27:46.799 --> 27:49.168
I've been in meetings all day,
as you can imagine.

27:49.201 --> 27:50.669
Yeah, you had an excuse
last night, too.

27:51.804 --> 27:52.805
The boss told you
to stay home?

27:52.839 --> 27:54.440
I wasn't gonna argue.

27:54.473 --> 27:55.942
It was Valentine's Day.

27:55.975 --> 27:57.176
A little nookie, then?

27:57.209 --> 27:59.045
(Ellicott clears throat)

27:59.078 --> 28:03.149
A data wipe is a security
precaution that I take

28:03.182 --> 28:05.284
every six months.
It's standard procedure

28:05.317 --> 28:07.453
to rid the system
of any bugs or viruses.

28:07.486 --> 28:09.221
REEVES: So the fact
you ordered the wipe

28:09.255 --> 28:11.190
the night of the murder was...
A fluke.

28:11.223 --> 28:12.959
I'm thinking
of another word.

28:13.960 --> 28:15.461
A happenstance.

28:15.494 --> 28:17.363
No.
Coincidence?

28:17.396 --> 28:18.464
Yeah.

28:18.497 --> 28:19.932
And why is that important?

28:19.966 --> 28:21.033
'Cause there's no such thing.

28:21.067 --> 28:23.770
REEVES: You ordered the wipe
to erase your connection.

28:23.803 --> 28:24.937
We spoke to your wife.

28:24.971 --> 28:26.973
She said you was
at the office all night.

28:27.006 --> 28:29.041
(honks)
No nookie.

28:29.075 --> 28:30.843
ELLICOTT:
That's-- Now, wait.

28:30.877 --> 28:34.947
I... I had nothing to do
with any of this.

28:34.981 --> 28:35.948
Why lie?

28:38.985 --> 28:40.953
Because I was hacked.

28:42.354 --> 28:43.489
When?

28:43.522 --> 28:45.357
Last night.

28:45.391 --> 28:49.528
I was using a personal computer
at home,

28:49.561 --> 28:50.963
trying to do some
work so that

28:50.997 --> 28:52.298
I could spend the
evening with my wife.

28:52.331 --> 28:53.933
And I got an alert

28:53.966 --> 28:56.002
that someone was remotely
accessing my hard drive.

28:56.035 --> 28:58.805
Using a personal computer
for government business?

28:58.838 --> 28:59.939
GIBBS:
Even I know

28:59.972 --> 29:01.140
that's bad.

29:01.173 --> 29:03.843
That's why I went
to the office last night

29:03.876 --> 29:05.544
and I ordered a data wipe.

29:05.577 --> 29:07.246
To stop the spread.

29:07.279 --> 29:08.981
And to cover your ass.

29:09.015 --> 29:10.249
I could get fired.

29:10.282 --> 29:12.518
Or indicted.

29:12.551 --> 29:15.888
But it had nothing to do
with Earl's murder, I swear.

29:15.922 --> 29:18.791
QUINN: Ellicott handed over
his computer.

29:18.825 --> 29:20.559
Where's McGee?
Already doing his thing.

29:20.592 --> 29:23.562
Yeah, good.
Bomb squad report.

29:23.595 --> 29:26.265
Well, they found prints from
the entire think tank, no help.

29:26.298 --> 29:28.434
Only one bomb
was real. Why?

29:28.467 --> 29:30.002
Deadly enough
to make a statement,

29:30.036 --> 29:31.337
but less chance
of getting caught.

29:31.370 --> 29:33.305
Potential targets
in the VIP suites?

29:33.339 --> 29:35.341
The, uh,
arena security records,

29:35.374 --> 29:37.043
they list a few
wealthy concert-goers,

29:37.076 --> 29:38.911
but no names of interest

29:38.945 --> 29:40.112
and none that connect
to the think tank.

29:40.146 --> 29:41.513
All right, keep digging.

29:41.547 --> 29:44.283
Yeah. That's all it's been
so far is guesswork.

29:44.316 --> 29:46.385
Hey.

29:47.553 --> 29:49.055
What?

29:49.088 --> 29:50.389
I'm sorry, it's just-- nothing.

29:50.422 --> 29:52.324
It's just family stuff.

29:52.358 --> 29:54.360
Gibbs? MTAC.

29:54.393 --> 29:56.929
McGee's got something.

29:59.899 --> 30:01.167
You've never been
to New Orleans?

30:01.200 --> 30:03.235
We got to get you down here.

30:03.269 --> 30:06.105
Well, I'd rather it be
for fun than, uh, work.

30:06.138 --> 30:07.439
Oh, it's always fun.

30:07.473 --> 30:09.909
Especially
since Mardi Gras is coming up.

30:09.942 --> 30:13.079
Hey, tell Gibbs
you need a little vacation.

30:13.112 --> 30:15.114
We all do,
Christopher.

30:15.147 --> 30:17.249
And what happened to Alabama?

30:17.283 --> 30:19.852
Oh, man, why are you hitting me
below the belt?

30:19.886 --> 30:21.153
That's a long conversation.

30:21.187 --> 30:22.554
I look forward to it.

30:22.588 --> 30:24.456
Agent Lasalle,
it's good to see you.

30:24.490 --> 30:27.459
Yes, sir, but I think you're
gonna be taking that back.

30:27.493 --> 30:30.029
I traced the hack on Ellicott.

30:30.062 --> 30:31.898
Came from an I.P. address
in the French Quarter.

30:31.931 --> 30:34.266
Yeah, empty apartment
above a voodoo shop.

30:34.300 --> 30:36.235
But this one's just
a tourist trap.

30:36.268 --> 30:37.403
As opposed to?

30:37.436 --> 30:39.538
Well, that's a good point.

30:39.571 --> 30:42.174
We really got
to get you down here, McGee.

30:42.208 --> 30:43.943
The apartment's last occupant?

30:43.976 --> 30:46.078
Well, in jail
going on two years.

30:46.112 --> 30:48.214
He was running a brothel
out of the place,

30:48.247 --> 30:50.950
and it's been vacant ever since.
It's a dead end.

30:50.983 --> 30:53.319
McGee, what did the hackers
get away with?

30:53.352 --> 30:54.620
Well, that's the
problem, Director.

30:54.653 --> 30:56.222
It's why I called the
NOLA offices right away.

30:56.255 --> 30:57.623
Lawrence, bring it up.

31:00.126 --> 31:02.228
Somebody downloaded the files

31:02.261 --> 31:04.496
on every Homeland
think tank operation

31:04.530 --> 31:06.065
from the last two years.

31:06.098 --> 31:07.633
Dozens of simulated
attack scenarios.

31:07.666 --> 31:09.501
Simulated but successful?

31:09.535 --> 31:12.304
The team pointed
out weaknesses from

31:12.338 --> 31:15.241
airports and train stations
to government buildings.

31:15.274 --> 31:16.976
Yeah, blueprints
on how to attack us.

31:17.009 --> 31:18.477
McGEE:
Yeah, the stolen files

31:18.510 --> 31:21.914
also detailed how Homeland would
respond to such attacks.

31:21.948 --> 31:24.250
Offense and defense.

31:24.283 --> 31:26.352
Someone has our entire
terror playbook.

31:35.727 --> 31:37.329
VANCE:
I already spoke with SecDef.

31:37.363 --> 31:38.998
Someone is selling
our entire terrorist playbook.

31:39.031 --> 31:40.566
We will follow up here

31:40.599 --> 31:43.202
while our agents in New Orleans
are following up with their...

31:43.235 --> 31:45.938
I will keep you updated.

31:45.972 --> 31:47.506
National Security Advisor.

31:47.539 --> 31:50.076
He's looking to blame someone
for the stolen playbook.

31:50.109 --> 31:51.477
He should be looking
to get it back.

31:51.510 --> 31:53.479
Terror alert's been
raised until we do.

31:53.512 --> 31:55.114
I was hoping maybe
you had a plan.

31:55.147 --> 31:57.183
That's why I'm here, Leon.

31:59.385 --> 32:02.688
Oh. You were gonna run the idea
by the director

32:02.721 --> 32:04.256
before I came in?

32:04.290 --> 32:06.492
Well, somebody start talking.

32:06.525 --> 32:09.996
Sir, I worked several
undercover investigations,

32:10.029 --> 32:12.231
including stolen
government intel.

32:12.264 --> 32:14.366
We now have that in spades.
Exactly.

32:14.400 --> 32:16.302
But something this big
will cause ripples.

32:16.335 --> 32:19.271
I put my pole in the
water, wait for nibbles,

32:19.305 --> 32:21.507
maybe a bite.
I get the metaphor.

32:21.540 --> 32:24.043
One of your old contacts
could be connected.

32:25.277 --> 32:26.545
It's a long shot.

32:26.578 --> 32:28.114
It's the only shot we got.

32:28.147 --> 32:29.581
It's the playbook.

32:31.017 --> 32:33.119
Phone calls only, Agent Torres.

32:33.152 --> 32:35.254
You are not undercover.

32:35.287 --> 32:37.556
Sir.

32:39.225 --> 32:40.993
Doesn't help
our murder case, Gibbs,

32:41.027 --> 32:42.561
or find that missing sarin.

32:42.594 --> 32:45.264
I'm gonna go back
to the beginning.

32:45.297 --> 32:46.332
Meaning?

32:49.401 --> 32:51.770
The war game.
Why do it?
That's what we've been trying

32:51.803 --> 32:53.472
to figure out, boss.
Who gains from the attack?

32:53.505 --> 32:55.074
No. Homeland.

32:55.107 --> 32:57.543
Why choose this operation?
Why this arena?

32:57.576 --> 32:59.078
Well, there'd been
intelligence chatter

32:59.111 --> 33:00.412
about terror groups
getting sarin.

33:00.446 --> 33:02.481
What groups?
Bishop's finding that out now.

33:02.514 --> 33:05.217
In order to fund a field
exercise, Homeland had

33:05.251 --> 33:07.319
to submit detailed
security reports.

33:07.353 --> 33:08.754
I want to see 'em.

33:08.787 --> 33:11.490
No need, Gibbs.
Thanks, Tommy.

33:11.523 --> 33:14.560
The chatter was fake.
I got the intelligence file

33:14.593 --> 33:17.196
from Homeland and sent it
to the NSA for verification.

33:17.229 --> 33:19.365
There are no terror groups
with sarin.

33:19.398 --> 33:21.667
Someone altered the report.
McGEE:
Tricking Earl into

33:21.700 --> 33:23.135
creating this whole operation.

33:23.169 --> 33:24.470
The question is why.

33:24.503 --> 33:26.138
(sighs)

33:28.340 --> 33:30.776
Hey.
Hey. So, the real bomb was

33:30.809 --> 33:32.744
planted in the duct
that fed the VIP suites

33:32.778 --> 33:34.346
in the northwest corner.

33:34.380 --> 33:35.714
Including Suite 11?

33:35.747 --> 33:37.483
(keyboard keys clicking)
Yeah.

33:37.516 --> 33:39.185
11 through 20. Why?

33:39.218 --> 33:41.687
Well, the arena record shows

33:41.720 --> 33:43.822
suite 11 had private bodyguards.

33:43.855 --> 33:46.458
Who were they protecting?
Uh, "Dexter Highland"?

33:46.492 --> 33:49.161
Never heard of him.
Well, that's why it didn't flag.

33:49.195 --> 33:51.063
But we found out
it was a cover name.

33:51.097 --> 33:52.298
Somebody famous?

33:52.331 --> 33:54.066
The security records
don't say,

33:54.100 --> 33:56.102
but they do say
the guards were armed.

33:56.135 --> 33:57.703
Which means

33:57.736 --> 34:00.572
I can pull
conceal-and-carry permits,

34:00.606 --> 34:02.741
and find out who they were
really working for.

34:02.774 --> 34:05.311
QUINN: Jovan Dezic,

34:05.344 --> 34:07.446
Bosnian foreign affairs
minister.

34:07.479 --> 34:10.849
He was at the concert
with his 16-year-old son

34:10.882 --> 34:12.751
And you knew that
because he had to

34:12.784 --> 34:15.187
register his travel
plans with Homeland.

34:15.221 --> 34:18.524
That's, uh, standard
procedure for diplomats.

34:18.557 --> 34:20.259
So are pseudonyms.

34:20.292 --> 34:21.493
But he wasn't always

34:21.527 --> 34:23.129
a respected politician.
No.

34:23.162 --> 34:26.765
Dezic was part of
the Bosnian-Serb army

34:26.798 --> 34:29.135
during the genocide.

34:29.168 --> 34:31.770
Ever heard of
"Sniper Alley," Gibbs?

34:31.803 --> 34:34.106
Sarajevo.

34:34.140 --> 34:36.242
Civilians murdered
in cold blood.

34:36.275 --> 34:38.510
Including your parents.

34:40.779 --> 34:42.381
Dezic was suspected
of being there,

34:42.414 --> 34:44.216
though it was
never proven.

34:44.250 --> 34:45.151
This was revenge.

34:45.184 --> 34:47.353
You altered the report

34:47.386 --> 34:49.555
before you gave it
to Earl.

34:49.588 --> 34:52.491
And you took his security
clearance to steal the sarin.

34:52.524 --> 34:55.894
And it was you who switched
the bomb and the balloons.

34:55.927 --> 34:57.329
Did I miss anything?

34:57.363 --> 34:59.298
Yeah, he was with Earl
that night.

34:59.331 --> 35:00.732
Right, you were with Earl
when he watched

35:00.766 --> 35:01.967
on the security cameras,

35:02.000 --> 35:05.804
and those balloons were not
the balloons that Earl filled.

35:05.837 --> 35:07.806
Nope. These were.
They had lettering
on them.

35:09.875 --> 35:11.777
Found 'em in the hotel Dumpster.

35:11.810 --> 35:13.279
Your fingerprints on 'em.

35:13.312 --> 35:14.580
Earl suspected
something was going on.

35:14.613 --> 35:16.215
He wanted to abort the mission.

35:16.248 --> 35:17.483
You couldn't let that happen,
could you?

35:17.516 --> 35:18.617
You sat here and
told me that

35:18.650 --> 35:20.519
Earl was like your father.

35:21.820 --> 35:23.155
But you killed him.

35:23.189 --> 35:25.257
In avenging
your parents,

35:25.291 --> 35:26.558
you lost another one.

35:30.296 --> 35:31.830
Dezic deserves to die.

35:33.465 --> 35:34.600
For what he did to my country,

35:34.633 --> 35:35.901
uh, what he did to me.

35:37.336 --> 35:39.405
Except you failed.

35:43.442 --> 35:44.910
GIBBS:
McGee.

35:44.943 --> 35:46.378
Dezic, where is he?

35:46.412 --> 35:47.913
Just spoke with his
security detail.

35:47.946 --> 35:49.715
Where is he?
He is recovering
from heart surgery

35:49.748 --> 35:51.250
(phone ringing)
at Washington General--

35:51.283 --> 35:52.551
it's why he was here in the U.S.

35:52.584 --> 35:54.353
What, do you think
he's still in danger?

35:55.454 --> 35:56.588
Yeah, Reeves, go.

35:56.622 --> 35:57.723
We've tossed Phil's flat,

35:57.756 --> 35:59.591
and we found
the missing sarin bottle.

35:59.625 --> 36:01.960
The problem is he's been
using it; we're thinking

36:01.993 --> 36:02.928
he might have
something else planned.

36:02.961 --> 36:04.963
We're already on it.
Another ventilation attack

36:04.996 --> 36:06.832
at the hospital?
ABBY: No way.

36:06.865 --> 36:08.267
He doesn't have a team

36:08.300 --> 36:10.569
doing his dirty work.

36:10.602 --> 36:13.872
This is plan B.
Last ditch-- he is desperate.

36:13.905 --> 36:15.574
He's got no balloons.
He knows we're looking for him.

36:15.607 --> 36:18.544
Balloons were just one
of a dozen ideas

36:18.577 --> 36:19.611
I pitched the team.

36:19.645 --> 36:20.712
Abby.

36:20.746 --> 36:23.982
I was told to be evil.

36:24.015 --> 36:25.584
And be good now.

36:25.617 --> 36:27.919
How does Phil get sarin
into the hospital room?

36:36.262 --> 36:38.497
(door opens)

36:58.450 --> 37:00.786
A fruit bowl.

37:00.819 --> 37:03.289
Wow.

37:07.859 --> 37:09.995
Your diplomat friends
are too classy, Dad.

37:11.830 --> 37:14.433
Why can't they just send pizza?

37:25.844 --> 37:27.012
(bag pops)

37:31.317 --> 37:33.452
Stop. Federal agents.
Don't pop that.

37:33.485 --> 37:34.986
Okay.

37:39.591 --> 37:41.593
This one has sarin.
What's going on?

37:43.395 --> 37:45.664
Good just triumphed over evil.

37:45.697 --> 37:47.499
I mean,

37:47.533 --> 37:50.336
who can resist popping?

37:53.539 --> 37:56.675
You got me a gift.

37:56.708 --> 38:00.412
(gasps)
Tickets to The Sterile Puppets.

38:00.446 --> 38:01.747
We all chipped in.

38:01.780 --> 38:02.848
Figured after all
you'd been through,

38:02.881 --> 38:03.982
you deserve a break.

38:04.015 --> 38:06.418
Well, now we can all go.

38:08.019 --> 38:11.557
Director Vance got me tickets
as a peace offering,

38:11.590 --> 38:13.725
and the band lets me in
for free, so...

38:13.759 --> 38:15.727
So everything's good.
Yeah.

38:15.761 --> 38:17.963
Almost.

38:17.996 --> 38:19.798
There's still something
really bothering me.

38:19.831 --> 38:21.767
How you got caught
in the first place.

38:21.800 --> 38:23.535
Yeah. How'd you know?

38:23.569 --> 38:26.505
Well, I figured that Evil Abby
was also a perfectionist,

38:26.538 --> 38:28.574
so I kept digging
into Earl's laptop.

38:28.607 --> 38:29.575
And?

38:29.608 --> 38:31.042
When Earl was killed,

38:31.076 --> 38:33.379
his computer was connected
to the arena network.

38:33.412 --> 38:34.546
Right.

38:34.580 --> 38:37.749
Abby, you didn't trigger
anything.

38:37.783 --> 38:39.418
He did.

38:39.451 --> 38:41.553
When Phil poisoned him
and left him for dead,

38:41.587 --> 38:43.489
Earl set off a silent alarm.

38:44.656 --> 38:47.793
That is good over evil.
(phone ringing)

38:47.826 --> 38:49.795
Let's hope that
trend continues.

38:49.828 --> 38:51.029
The playbook's
still out there.

38:51.062 --> 38:53.632
Yeah, boss?
Yeah, on my way.

38:56.802 --> 38:58.904
Ferdinand Pisco.
Doesn't ring a bell, Gibbs.

38:58.937 --> 39:00.606
He'd like to keep it that way.

39:00.639 --> 39:02.040
He deals with
stolen information,

39:02.073 --> 39:04.376
and keeps his own hidden,
moves in the shadow,

39:04.410 --> 39:05.544
which is where I live.

39:07.946 --> 39:10.148
What Agent Torres means is
he used to live in shadow.

39:10.181 --> 39:11.383
Undercover.

39:11.417 --> 39:13.519
Working for Pisco. Got it.

39:13.552 --> 39:16.688
You recall Special Agent Jones,
Wichita?

39:16.722 --> 39:19.157
(chuckles) Yeah.

39:19.190 --> 39:20.692
Eager. Reckless.

39:20.726 --> 39:21.827
Effective.

39:21.860 --> 39:23.695
Are you guys judging me?

39:23.729 --> 39:26.898
How's Pisco connected
to the missing terror playbook?

39:26.932 --> 39:28.400
It was hacked from New Orleans.

39:28.434 --> 39:29.801
He's headed your way.

39:29.835 --> 39:31.437
TORRES: I shook a few
trees and found out

39:31.470 --> 39:32.771
that he booked a last-minute
trip from Venezuela.

39:32.804 --> 39:34.440
He's coming to buy the playbook.

39:34.473 --> 39:35.774
We don't know who stole it,

39:35.807 --> 39:37.643
so at this point
it's all conjecture.

39:37.676 --> 39:39.077
Sir, with all due respect,

39:39.110 --> 39:42.548
this guy doesn't travel
unless it's something big.

39:42.581 --> 39:44.082
It's the playbook.

39:44.115 --> 39:46.017
If I make contact,
I can prove it.

39:47.586 --> 39:49.955
Director...
send me undercover.

39:52.458 --> 39:56.061
Gibbs, I'm ready.
Pack your bag.

39:56.094 --> 39:58.530
You will report to Agent Pride
the second you arrive.

39:58.564 --> 39:59.798
Roger that.

39:59.831 --> 40:01.533
I'll be waiting
for his call, Director.

40:01.567 --> 40:04.135
Gibbs, be in touch.
Yeah, count on that.

40:05.571 --> 40:06.805
Torres is going to NOLA?

40:06.838 --> 40:09.441
Yeah. So are you.

40:09.475 --> 40:10.576
Don't let him out
of your sight.

40:10.609 --> 40:12.478
You understand?

40:12.511 --> 40:14.112
You got it.
When do we leave?

40:14.145 --> 40:15.914
Now. Go.
