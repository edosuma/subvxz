00:00.974 --> 00:02.544
<i>Previously on</i>
Covert Affairs...

00:02.545 --> 00:04.401
I don't ever expect you
to forgive me.

00:04.402 --> 00:05.385
It's too late.

00:05.437 --> 00:06.904
You and Arthur hired Helen.

00:06.988 --> 00:08.739
She's following Henry
to Geneva.

00:08.823 --> 00:10.107
We thought she might be able
to shed some light

00:10.191 --> 00:11.325
on Henry's finances.

00:11.392 --> 00:13.026
Henry took a dozen trips

00:13.077 --> 00:14.638
out to a patch of park land
in Virginia.

00:14.662 --> 00:16.163
Camp Hillcrest?

00:16.230 --> 00:18.782
This is where Henry took Jai
camping as a boy.

00:18.867 --> 00:22.035
- Your name?
- Jessica Matthews.

00:22.086 --> 00:23.704
I'm sure you wouldn't want
anything to happen

00:23.755 --> 00:25.923
to Violet, would you?
Do you know who Violet is?

00:26.007 --> 00:28.575
- No.
- My name is Andrew Goodman.

00:28.626 --> 00:30.677
Henry ordered that helicopter
shot down,

00:30.745 --> 00:32.212
and you were the one
that fired the missile.

00:32.262 --> 00:34.298
- I'll kill you myself!
- Donna. Donna!

00:37.936 --> 00:40.354
I'm gonna find
Jessica Matthews and kill her.

01:22.263 --> 01:25.516
It is 5:30
in the morning.

01:25.600 --> 01:27.935
Who is it?
Auggie, It's Helen.

01:30.638 --> 01:31.772
We need to talk.

01:31.823 --> 01:33.240
I thought I made things
pretty clear

01:33.307 --> 01:35.409
the last time
that we talked.

01:35.476 --> 01:37.277
I just got back
from Geneva.

01:37.328 --> 01:40.313
Yeah, Joan told me.
You were tracking Henry.

01:40.365 --> 01:42.082
You just got back <i>now?</i>

01:42.149 --> 01:45.536
Yesterday, but I couldn't
exactly see you at work.

01:45.620 --> 01:47.955
Well, what'd you find?

01:48.006 --> 01:51.992
There was another operative
besides me following Henry.

01:52.043 --> 01:54.127
Annie.

01:56.431 --> 01:58.549
She's alive.

01:58.633 --> 02:00.166
I thought
about not telling you,

02:00.218 --> 02:02.669
but I don't want to lie to you
anymore about anything.

02:02.720 --> 02:06.273
No. You did the right thing.

02:09.310 --> 02:10.676
Did you speak with her?

02:10.728 --> 02:14.531
She didn't see me,
but she was fine.

02:20.738 --> 02:23.907
You knew she was alive,
didn't you?

02:23.992 --> 02:25.909
Yeah, I did.

02:28.696 --> 02:31.381
Even when I came here
to tell you I wanted you back?

02:31.466 --> 02:32.382
You know I couldn't
tell you.

02:32.467 --> 02:35.502
No, you're right.

02:35.553 --> 02:39.590
But it doesn't change
how I feel about you, Auggie.

02:39.674 --> 02:42.059
Why don't you tell me
what else you found in Geneva?

03:13.758 --> 03:15.926
So you're telling me
three-year hotel surveillance,

03:16.010 --> 03:18.762
you overheard Henry talking
to his money guy Nelson?

03:18.846 --> 03:20.413
I only heard Henry's side.

03:20.465 --> 03:22.966
But he needed Nelson
to get him $3 million.

03:23.051 --> 03:25.469
Henry sounded rattled.

03:25.553 --> 03:27.304
Annie's pushing
his buttons.

03:27.388 --> 03:29.306
How do you know?

03:29.390 --> 03:31.642
Because that's what
she went dark to do.

03:31.726 --> 03:33.393
And when Annie puts her mind
to something,

03:33.444 --> 03:35.195
there's no stopping her.

03:37.098 --> 03:38.732
I'm gonna go.

03:38.783 --> 03:40.266
What are you gonna
tell Joan?

03:40.318 --> 03:44.738
Nothing about Annie.

03:44.789 --> 03:46.206
If there is anyone
who can relate

03:46.273 --> 03:49.442
to what she's going through,
it's me.

03:49.494 --> 03:53.880
And I know things are
complicated.

03:53.948 --> 03:57.217
I'm here if you want
to talk.

04:00.121 --> 04:02.589
I'm afraid this
couldn't wait, Mr. Michaels.

04:02.640 --> 04:04.174
When you go in to work,
you'll hear about the death

04:04.258 --> 04:06.093
of one of our own--

04:06.144 --> 04:08.762
Deric Hughes.

04:08.813 --> 04:11.131
- I don't know the name.
- You shouldn't.

04:11.182 --> 04:14.401
Hughes was an extremely
deep cover CIA operative.

04:14.468 --> 04:16.687
Reported directly to D.C.I.

04:16.771 --> 04:19.940
His missions were completely
off book.

04:19.991 --> 04:23.076
His star will not have a name
next to it for a long time.

04:23.144 --> 04:24.811
What happened to him?

04:24.862 --> 04:27.781
A few days ago, he was
brutally murdered in Geneva.

04:27.832 --> 04:29.616
Hughes's killer is
still at large,

04:29.667 --> 04:31.702
but my friends in Geneva
have already identified

04:31.786 --> 04:35.539
a person of interest--
a woman.

04:35.623 --> 04:38.008
Her name is Jessica Matthews.
Have you heard of her?

04:38.092 --> 04:40.377
Doesn't ring a bell.

04:40.461 --> 04:43.547
Name's likely an alias.

04:43.631 --> 04:46.767
So what are you asking me
to do?

04:46.834 --> 04:49.720
I want you to let me know
when you find her.

04:49.804 --> 04:52.105
I'm gonna need more than that
if I'm gonna give you access

04:52.140 --> 04:53.974
to an internal agency
investigation.

04:54.025 --> 04:55.942
Eric Braithwaite's proving
he's not the man

04:56.010 --> 04:57.360
for the D.C.S. job.

04:57.445 --> 05:02.032
I'd be surprised if he lasts
till the end of the month.

05:02.116 --> 05:04.701
There's going to be
a vacuum.

05:04.786 --> 05:06.737
Maybe you and I
can fill it together.

05:39.553 --> 05:41.271
There's a lot of ghosts
in here.

05:41.355 --> 05:42.739
It's nice to not be
the only one.

05:42.824 --> 05:44.991
Ghosts are supposed
to be invisible, remember?

05:45.059 --> 05:46.492
We gotta show our face
sometime.

05:55.495 --> 05:57.583
Reaching out like this,
puts us both at a big risk.

05:57.585 --> 05:58.735
I'm assuming you have
the evidence

05:58.787 --> 06:00.788
to take down Henry Wilcox--
am I right?

06:00.872 --> 06:02.673
This belonged to the man
who shot down the helicopter

06:02.740 --> 06:04.007
in Copenhagen.

06:04.075 --> 06:06.710
He worked for Henry.
His name was Andrew Goodman.

06:06.761 --> 06:08.679
His name <i>was</i>
<i>Andrew Goodman?</i>

06:08.746 --> 06:11.465
He I.D.'d me in Geneva.
I was supposed to kill him.

06:11.549 --> 06:14.468
So I'm guessing
you're Jessica Matthews.

06:14.552 --> 06:15.936
That was my cover.

06:16.020 --> 06:18.972
Well, Henry just told me
about a woman of the same name

06:19.057 --> 06:20.524
killing a man in Geneva.

06:20.591 --> 06:21.758
So you two are buddies now?

06:21.810 --> 06:23.060
I killed you, remember?

06:23.111 --> 06:24.761
It gave me the opportunity
to get close to him.

06:24.813 --> 06:27.648
Careful, you are dancing
with the devil.

06:27.732 --> 06:29.599
I like to dance.

06:29.651 --> 06:31.702
But it's Jessica Matthews
who needs to be careful.

06:31.769 --> 06:33.537
Henry wants me
to find her.

06:33.604 --> 06:35.539
He also gave me
Goodman's real name.

06:35.606 --> 06:36.990
It's Deric Hughes.

06:37.075 --> 06:39.276
He was a CIA
deep-cover op.

06:39.327 --> 06:41.328
That's why Auggie and I
could never I.D. him.

06:41.412 --> 06:42.612
Okay, I'm gonna get this
to Auggie

06:42.664 --> 06:44.548
and have him dig through it
right away.

06:44.615 --> 06:46.083
Or have you reached out
to him already?

06:46.134 --> 06:48.585
No. Reaching out to him
puts him at risk.

06:48.636 --> 06:51.505
So you're worried about his
life, but not mine, huh?

06:51.589 --> 06:53.290
I told myself I'd never
reach out to Auggie

06:53.341 --> 06:54.391
when I went dark.

06:54.458 --> 06:56.476
You need to leave town today.

06:56.561 --> 06:58.178
I know what I'm doing.

06:58.263 --> 07:00.463
So you changed your hair.

07:00.515 --> 07:03.483
Changed your modus operandi.
Okay.

07:03.568 --> 07:06.019
But if Henry Wilcox
puts together

07:06.104 --> 07:08.188
that Jessica Matthews
is really Annie Walker,

07:08.273 --> 07:10.657
he's gonna know that I lied
to him about killing you,

07:10.742 --> 07:12.642
and try to put a bullet
in both of our heads.

07:20.318 --> 07:22.586
Auggie.

07:22.653 --> 07:25.589
Calder, you driving
the company shuttle today?

07:25.656 --> 07:29.459
Get in.

07:29.510 --> 07:31.595
I need you to run
all the data recovery programs

07:31.662 --> 07:33.330
you have on this thing.
Take it apart.

07:33.381 --> 07:35.101
Find anything that connects
to Henry Wilcox.

07:35.166 --> 07:37.834
- Where'd you get this?
- Geneva station.

07:37.886 --> 07:39.836
CIA Geneva station?

07:39.888 --> 07:42.505
CIA Geneva station chief
sent it over this morning.

07:42.557 --> 07:44.524
It belonged to a deep cover op
named Deric Hughes.

07:44.609 --> 07:47.394
I discovered he has
close ties with Henry.

07:47.478 --> 07:49.363
You can't analyze it
at Langley.

07:49.447 --> 07:52.366
Take it home.

09:04.055 --> 09:06.023
Back from Geneva already?

09:06.090 --> 09:09.026
I go where
Henry Wilcox goes.

09:15.283 --> 09:17.234
I knew Sana
had to be involved.

09:17.285 --> 09:19.269
It's all in the report.

09:19.320 --> 09:21.371
Including the transcripts
of two phone calls

09:21.439 --> 09:23.657
Henry had with a money man
named Nelson.

09:23.741 --> 09:24.941
Good work.

09:24.993 --> 09:26.460
We gave you a tall order,
and you delivered.

09:26.544 --> 09:28.328
I am good at what I do.

09:28.413 --> 09:31.164
- Yes, you are.
- I want back in.

09:31.249 --> 09:33.717
I want back into Langley.

09:33.784 --> 09:36.503
Look, I know that
this is difficult for you.

09:36.587 --> 09:38.255
I know how much
you've sacrificed.

09:38.306 --> 09:41.308
But now is not the time.

09:41.392 --> 09:44.511
Mission first.

09:47.899 --> 09:49.466
Man, there's a lot
of stuff here.

09:49.517 --> 09:51.601
What are we looking for?
Any file or deleted file

09:51.652 --> 09:54.321
that mentions Copenhagen
or Medellin.

09:54.405 --> 09:56.523
Copenhagen and Medellin.

09:56.607 --> 09:59.860
Hold on, I got something.

09:59.944 --> 10:01.945
It's an embedded email
to Henry Wilcox.

10:01.996 --> 10:03.447
It's encoded.

10:03.498 --> 10:04.948
Okay, well, let's decode
this rascal.

10:04.999 --> 10:06.700
I'm gonna upload
some decryption packages.

10:06.784 --> 10:09.836
No, it's a one-time pad.
We need the cipher.

10:09.921 --> 10:12.873
Old school, huh?

10:12.957 --> 10:14.458
Any idea what they'd use
as a key?

10:14.509 --> 10:17.127
They're often books, but that
doesn't narrow it down much.

10:17.178 --> 10:18.628
No, not much at all.

10:18.679 --> 10:21.014
Look, we need this key.

10:21.099 --> 10:23.800
This is a direct communication
from Henry Wilcox

10:23.851 --> 10:25.168
to one of his top lieutenants.

10:25.219 --> 10:27.354
This is the best lead we've had
in a long time.

10:27.438 --> 10:29.022
We have to know
what's in this message.

10:29.107 --> 10:30.223
Yep. Okay, man.

10:30.308 --> 10:31.892
We'll figure it out.
Don't worry.

10:31.976 --> 10:33.136
If it's any consolation, man,

10:33.144 --> 10:34.644
I just found
something else here.

10:34.695 --> 10:35.779
Looks like a contact list.

10:35.846 --> 10:36.780
Most of the names are
still jumbled,

10:36.847 --> 10:38.115
but dollars to doughnuts

10:38.182 --> 10:41.518
I can rebuild it
with a little elbow grease.

10:43.854 --> 10:47.657
I got your message.
You wanted to talk.

10:47.708 --> 10:49.709
I found the last name
of your guy Nelson.

10:49.794 --> 10:51.878
His last name is Smith.

10:51.963 --> 10:52.996
But we know he's in New York

10:53.047 --> 10:54.881
based on a partial
phone number.

10:54.966 --> 10:56.750
- How'd you find it?
- Got it off the laptop

10:56.834 --> 11:00.804
of Henry's man in Geneva,
Deric Hughes.

11:00.871 --> 11:03.173
From Annie?

11:03.224 --> 11:04.591
I think so.

11:04.675 --> 11:07.227
The laptop had
a coded message on it.

11:07.311 --> 11:08.812
Annie might know how to find
the source key,

11:08.879 --> 11:10.380
and I think she's in D.C.

11:10.431 --> 11:11.731
We need to find her.

11:11.816 --> 11:14.101
So you haven't seen Annie?

11:14.185 --> 11:15.185
No.

11:15.236 --> 11:17.487
I think she can help us
with this.

11:17.555 --> 11:19.556
I'll find Annie for you.

11:19.607 --> 11:21.775
If that's what you want me
to do.

11:21.859 --> 11:23.110
Follow Calder.

11:23.194 --> 11:25.195
He'll lead you to her
if she's still in town.

11:25.246 --> 11:26.413
And then what?

11:26.497 --> 11:28.115
And then I want
to talk to her.

11:28.199 --> 11:30.083
Okay.

11:30.168 --> 11:33.370
Hey, Helen.

11:33.421 --> 11:34.921
Thanks for doing this.

11:35.006 --> 11:37.924
I know it isn't easy
for you.

11:38.009 --> 11:40.927
You're welcome.

11:53.808 --> 11:54.858
Violet Hughes?

11:54.925 --> 11:56.560
- Yeah.
- I'm Susan Chandler

11:56.611 --> 11:57.594
with Preferred Life America.

11:57.645 --> 12:00.063
Our condolences
for your father.

12:00.114 --> 12:01.314
My father?

12:01.399 --> 12:03.283
Deric Hughes.

12:03.367 --> 12:04.734
He had a life insurance policy
with us

12:04.785 --> 12:07.621
that named you
as the sole beneficiary.

12:07.705 --> 12:09.739
Yeah, I don't--I don't know
anything about that.

12:09.790 --> 12:11.575
And I'm late to class,
so I'm just going to--

12:11.626 --> 12:14.661
The policy is worth
half a million dollars.

12:14.745 --> 12:17.914
Violet, when was the last time
you spoke with your father?

12:17.965 --> 12:19.332
It's been a while.

12:19.417 --> 12:20.800
Did he tell you
about the policy,

12:20.885 --> 12:21.801
or did you guys--

12:21.886 --> 12:24.671
Just leave me alone, okay?

12:24.755 --> 12:25.722
I am not here to hurt you.

12:25.789 --> 12:28.758
You are hurting me!

12:28.809 --> 12:31.144
You are not from a life
insurance company.

12:31.229 --> 12:32.262
No, I'm not.

12:32.313 --> 12:33.680
Your father gave you
that backpack,

12:33.764 --> 12:37.067
didn't he?

12:37.134 --> 12:38.185
What?

12:38.269 --> 12:39.186
He told you to run
if anyone

12:39.270 --> 12:41.021
ever asked about him.

12:41.105 --> 12:42.656
He wanted to protect you.

12:42.740 --> 12:44.774
I am really not here
to hurt you.

12:44.825 --> 12:49.329
I just need some information
about your father.

12:49.413 --> 12:51.281
What kind of information?

12:51.332 --> 12:53.033
We could start with where
he told you to go

12:53.117 --> 12:57.504
if anything happened to him.

13:01.375 --> 13:03.460
He told me to go to a place
called Hillcrest.

13:03.511 --> 13:05.378
Camp Hillcrest in Virginia?

13:05.463 --> 13:06.596
There's a cabin there.

13:06.664 --> 13:08.431
The guy that owns it
is supposed to help me.

13:08.499 --> 13:12.769
Violet, don't go.

13:12.836 --> 13:17.190
It is safer for you here.

13:17.275 --> 13:19.442
I promise you will never see
me again,

13:19.510 --> 13:22.445
and I will not tell anyone
I saw you.

13:30.871 --> 13:33.873
Just stay here
and live your life.

13:33.958 --> 13:35.992
You understand?

13:36.043 --> 13:39.462
Yeah.

15:44.603 --> 15:47.438
Okay.

15:47.697 --> 15:49.298
Thanks, Bianca.

15:49.866 --> 15:52.134
Helen's back from Geneva.

15:52.201 --> 15:54.002
Looks like she's identified
Henry's money man,

15:54.037 --> 15:57.389
a guy named... Nelson.

15:57.474 --> 16:01.226
Judge Sanders denied
our final motion for dismissal.

16:01.311 --> 16:04.980
Trial date has been set
for six weeks from today.

16:05.048 --> 16:06.098
That was fast.

16:06.182 --> 16:09.068
D.O.J. is very confident.

16:09.152 --> 16:10.653
Their case is stronger
than ours.

16:10.720 --> 16:12.387
They have affidavits

16:12.439 --> 16:14.440
specifying Teo's position
in the A.L.C.

16:14.524 --> 16:16.224
They have witnesses who swear
they saw he and Annie

16:16.276 --> 16:18.360
together in Copenhagen.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.562
Henry has been a step ahead
the entire time,

16:20.614 --> 16:22.197
and I can't think of a reason
why it--

16:22.248 --> 16:24.249
We have transcripts

16:24.334 --> 16:25.834
of Henry's phone calls
in Geneva.

16:25.902 --> 16:28.787
We have photographs of him
with his contacts there.

16:28.872 --> 16:31.590
Helen has given us
some very good intel.

16:31.675 --> 16:34.176
What good does that do us

16:34.243 --> 16:36.345
unless we start going
on the record with it?

16:36.412 --> 16:38.246
We need to tell the world
what Henry's done

16:38.298 --> 16:39.765
before this trial starts.

16:39.849 --> 16:40.849
You mean go to the press?

16:40.884 --> 16:43.886
No, no.
I--

16:43.937 --> 16:45.854
I want it to be official.

16:45.922 --> 16:47.756
I want us both to give
new depositions,

16:47.807 --> 16:49.858
and this time,
we hold nothing back.

16:49.926 --> 16:51.527
I have to believe
that if we plant

16:51.594 --> 16:54.897
even a small seed of doubt
in the prosecution's case,

16:54.948 --> 16:57.900
I'll stand a better chance
than I have now.

17:01.538 --> 17:05.324
Arthur, I'm trying
to stay positive.

17:05.407 --> 17:09.127
But sometimes
I lie awake at night

17:09.212 --> 17:11.997
imagining what life
will be like for me and the baby

17:12.082 --> 17:13.999
without you.

17:14.084 --> 17:18.753
And--and I don't like
how it feels.

17:18.805 --> 17:21.790
This is the right move.

17:21.840 --> 17:24.792
I'm convinced of it.

18:27.023 --> 18:29.958
Oh, you want to do this?
Come on, let's go.

18:32.295 --> 18:34.696
Get out of the car!

18:44.389 --> 18:45.808
You're late.

18:45.809 --> 18:47.277
Hit some traffic.

18:47.328 --> 18:50.280
Why are you still in town?

18:54.502 --> 18:56.252
What am I looking at?

18:56.320 --> 18:57.754
A few months ago,

18:57.821 --> 18:58.922
Auggie and I pulled
the G.P.S. data

18:58.989 --> 19:00.790
off Henry Wilcox's car.

19:00.841 --> 19:02.659
It showed him going
to a Camp Hillcrest

19:02.710 --> 19:05.295
in Virginia
at least a dozen times.

19:05.346 --> 19:07.847
He said he took Jai camping
there, which is true,

19:07.932 --> 19:10.517
but he's also been doing
other things there.

19:10.601 --> 19:11.601
Like what?

19:11.669 --> 19:13.603
Like meeting
with Deric Hughes.

19:13.671 --> 19:15.271
Hughes told his daughter
to go there

19:15.339 --> 19:17.357
if anyone
ever came asking,

19:17.441 --> 19:19.893
and I came asking.

19:19.977 --> 19:21.311
Annie, that girl
can I.D. you.

19:21.362 --> 19:24.847
You should have let me
talk to her.

19:24.899 --> 19:26.983
I gave you the laptop

19:27.034 --> 19:28.351
because I needed
a specialist like Auggie

19:28.402 --> 19:29.486
to analyze it,

19:29.537 --> 19:31.621
and I am telling you
about the cabin

19:31.689 --> 19:32.956
because I can't raid it.

19:33.023 --> 19:35.158
The place is secure
as a bank.

19:35.209 --> 19:37.544
But getting intel from someone
like Violet Hughes,

19:37.628 --> 19:39.295
that's something
I do best.

19:39.363 --> 19:42.465
Fine.

19:42.533 --> 19:44.584
I'll check out the cabin,
but it won't be easy.

19:44.669 --> 19:46.419
I think Henry
just had me followed.

19:46.504 --> 19:47.971
Henry tailed you?

19:48.038 --> 19:52.809
Halfway across D.C.

19:52.876 --> 19:56.012
It's too obvious.
It's not his style.

19:56.063 --> 19:59.015
It had to be someone else.

20:05.823 --> 20:08.692
Auggie knows I'm here.

20:08.743 --> 20:10.326
He followed you
to try and find me.

20:10.394 --> 20:12.562
That's a big leap,
because I haven't told him--

20:12.613 --> 20:13.913
just the way
you wanted it.

20:13.998 --> 20:15.898
He knew I was
in Geneva.

20:15.950 --> 20:18.401
He put two and two together
with Deric Hughes's laptop.

20:18.452 --> 20:19.753
Maybe I should have brought
him in directly.

20:19.837 --> 20:21.371
I mean, we found Hillcrest
together.

20:21.422 --> 20:23.039
Would you stop?

20:23.090 --> 20:24.907
You cannot speak to him,
for all the reasons

20:24.959 --> 20:27.877
you told me.

20:27.928 --> 20:29.429
Coming back is harder
than I thought.

20:29.513 --> 20:31.381
Hey.

20:31.432 --> 20:34.050
Auggie's a soldier.

20:34.101 --> 20:35.552
He knows what this is.

20:35.603 --> 20:37.137
Let him go.

20:37.221 --> 20:38.471
Follow your own rules,

20:38.556 --> 20:39.956
and we'll all get
out of this alive.

20:40.024 --> 20:43.860
All right?

20:43.927 --> 20:44.894
Mrs. Campbell,
I'd like to go back

20:44.945 --> 20:46.262
and clarify a few things

20:46.313 --> 20:49.149
regarding your relationship
with Teofilo Braga.

20:49.233 --> 20:50.266
That's fine.

20:50.317 --> 20:51.618
When exactly
did you first learn

20:51.702 --> 20:55.405
that Mr. Braga was your husband,
Arthur Campbell's son?

20:55.456 --> 20:58.241
June 9th
in Arthur's hotel suite.

20:58.292 --> 21:00.943
That's when he told me he had
a son named Teo.

21:00.995 --> 21:04.113
According to a mission report
dated June the 12th,

21:04.165 --> 21:06.916
a CIA black Ops team
raided the A.L.C. stronghold

21:06.967 --> 21:09.586
where Mr. Braga was located.

21:09.637 --> 21:12.121
At that time,
did you give operative Walker

21:12.173 --> 21:14.257
approval to use
extraordinary measures

21:14.308 --> 21:17.794
against him?

21:17.845 --> 21:19.479
Did you sanction Annie Walker

21:19.563 --> 21:22.315
and a CIA black Ops team
to torture Teo Braga

21:22.399 --> 21:24.684
with full knowledge that he
was your husband's son?

21:24.769 --> 21:27.637
Yes or no, Mrs. Campbell?

21:27.688 --> 21:29.105
Yes.

21:29.156 --> 21:30.774
And did your husband know
that you gave these orders?

21:30.825 --> 21:34.327
No, he didn't.

21:34.411 --> 21:36.196
But he will now.

21:39.083 --> 21:40.250
Anderson.

21:40.317 --> 21:44.003
We need to talk.

21:44.088 --> 21:45.154
Over here.

21:45.206 --> 21:46.656
Are we alone?

21:46.707 --> 21:47.674
Yeah, we're good.

21:47.758 --> 21:48.958
This isn't smart.

21:49.009 --> 21:50.293
No, what isn't smart
is you putting

21:50.344 --> 21:52.011
a goddamn tail on me.

21:52.096 --> 21:53.546
Who have you read
in on this?

21:53.631 --> 21:55.498
Why don't you ask
the station chief in Geneva?

21:55.549 --> 21:56.883
You know, the one who gave you
that laptop.

21:56.967 --> 21:58.935
- You know it was Annie.
- Wasn't hard to figure out.

21:59.002 --> 22:00.053
I need to talk to her.

22:00.137 --> 22:01.354
No, you don't.

22:01.438 --> 22:02.889
You gotta be loving this,
Calder,

22:02.973 --> 22:04.307
being the nexus
of information.

22:04.358 --> 22:06.278
But you're preventing the people
who need to talk

22:06.310 --> 22:07.393
from talking.

22:07.478 --> 22:08.728
I'm not preventing anything.

22:08.813 --> 22:09.946
I'm trying to keep feelings
out of this mission.

22:10.013 --> 22:11.564
- I know what a mission is.
- Okay.

22:11.649 --> 22:13.983
And this is not your call.

22:14.034 --> 22:16.986
I know.
It was hers.

22:17.037 --> 22:18.520
What?

22:21.242 --> 22:22.959
She's the one
who didn't want to see you,

22:23.026 --> 22:24.026
she told me.

22:24.078 --> 22:26.028
- You're lying.
- No.

22:26.080 --> 22:27.997
No, I'm trying
to protect you.

22:28.048 --> 22:29.048
Protect me from what?

22:29.133 --> 22:32.535
I need you focused,
Anderson,

22:32.586 --> 22:33.920
or else I'm gonna end up
in a cell

22:34.004 --> 22:35.004
right next to Arthur Campbell,

22:35.055 --> 22:36.556
and I ain't too good
with roommates.

22:36.640 --> 22:38.007
So this is
all about you again.

22:38.058 --> 22:39.542
No, it's about you and her.

22:39.593 --> 22:40.844
Let her go.

22:40.895 --> 22:42.044
You're putting us all
in jeopardy,

22:42.096 --> 22:45.047
Annie most of all.

23:43.157 --> 23:45.158
So it's all on record now.

23:45.242 --> 23:46.576
I can't say that the truth
didn't give me

23:46.627 --> 23:51.113
a few surprises.

23:51.165 --> 23:55.251
I'm sorry you had to find out
this way.

23:55.302 --> 23:58.304
How could you sanction
the torture of my son?

23:58.389 --> 23:59.710
Because I thought
I was preventing

23:59.757 --> 24:01.341
a terrorist attack.

24:01.425 --> 24:03.292
The intel said Teo
had a cache

24:03.344 --> 24:04.978
of bomb-making materials,

24:05.062 --> 24:08.181
and there was a threat
on an American target.

24:08.265 --> 24:10.016
I was doing my job.

24:10.100 --> 24:11.768
What if the torture
led to his death

24:11.819 --> 24:14.737
in that black site?

24:14.805 --> 24:16.856
It would have been
on your hands, Joan.

24:16.941 --> 24:19.108
And I would have felt
terrible.

24:19.159 --> 24:21.694
Absolutely...

24:21.779 --> 24:23.780
Terrible.

24:23.831 --> 24:27.533
Just how I felt
when we really did lose him.

24:30.504 --> 24:32.121
But that wouldn't have made
my decision

24:32.172 --> 24:35.174
the wrong one.

24:41.432 --> 24:46.269
Text message,
number 202-555-0133.

24:46.336 --> 24:48.021
"I need to see you.

24:48.105 --> 24:51.774
Take the 52 Metro bus
to 14th and Harvard."

25:46.080 --> 25:49.415
14th and Harvard Street
northwest.

25:58.241 --> 25:59.959
- Auggie.
- Hey.

26:00.044 --> 26:02.962
Hey.

26:05.132 --> 26:06.933
Look, I--

26:07.017 --> 26:08.935
I couldn't find Annie.

26:09.019 --> 26:10.470
Calder gave me the slip.

26:10.554 --> 26:12.271
Yeah, no, I, uh,
I know.

26:12.356 --> 26:13.940
He told me.

26:14.024 --> 26:15.558
Listen, you shouldn't text me
directly

26:15.609 --> 26:18.728
if you want to stay dark.

26:18.779 --> 26:20.096
Where are you taking me?

26:20.147 --> 26:23.099
Someplace I've been wanting
to show you.

26:27.538 --> 26:29.455
This is where I live.

26:29.540 --> 26:31.791
I mean...

26:31.875 --> 26:33.910
Where Teresa Hamilton lives.

26:33.961 --> 26:35.128
Helen, I shouldn't be here.

26:35.212 --> 26:36.129
It's a risk for your cover.

26:36.213 --> 26:37.246
I don't care.

26:37.297 --> 26:39.382
I don't want
a cover anymore.

26:39.449 --> 26:40.466
I want a life.

26:40.551 --> 26:42.284
I want a home.

26:42.336 --> 26:43.586
And part of what makes a home

26:43.637 --> 26:46.973
is having someone
to show it to.

26:47.057 --> 26:48.558
Okay.

26:48.625 --> 26:51.511
Show me this home.

26:51.595 --> 26:54.397
It's not much.

26:54.464 --> 26:57.316
This is the table
by the kitchen.

26:57.401 --> 26:58.568
Feels like a chair.

26:58.635 --> 27:00.937
Well, here's the table.

27:00.988 --> 27:03.156
Okay, um...

27:03.240 --> 27:04.190
You good?

27:04.274 --> 27:05.358
Hold on.

27:05.442 --> 27:07.160
I promise I'm not gonna fall.

27:07.244 --> 27:08.310
Sorry.

27:08.362 --> 27:09.695
I'm just getting used
to all of this.

27:09.780 --> 27:10.830
That's okay.

27:10.914 --> 27:13.332
Um, low table.

27:13.417 --> 27:15.084
Whoop.

27:15.152 --> 27:17.453
And here is the couch.

27:17.504 --> 27:22.008
Bedroom, bathroom to the left.

27:22.126 --> 27:26.162
What is it?

27:26.213 --> 27:29.182
It smells like you.

27:29.266 --> 27:32.135
Do you want a drink?

27:32.186 --> 27:36.305
The wine--oh, wait.

27:37.641 --> 27:38.891
I want you to know I'm sorry
about Annie.

27:38.976 --> 27:40.776
I know how much
it meant to you,

27:40.844 --> 27:44.363
and I did try.

27:44.448 --> 27:45.448
Calder got her the intel.

27:45.449 --> 27:47.116
That was the important part.

27:49.119 --> 27:51.287
When I told you
our marriage wasn't real,

27:51.354 --> 27:53.573
that it was a cover,
I was lying.

27:53.657 --> 27:55.324
Those are the kind of lies
you need to tell yourself

27:55.375 --> 27:57.543
to survive the way I did.

27:57.628 --> 27:59.795
I'm sorry for all the pain
I caused you.

27:59.863 --> 28:02.798
I truly am.

28:06.036 --> 28:07.637
I'm glad you're here.

28:07.704 --> 28:09.305
In D.C.?

28:09.372 --> 28:11.007
In D.C.

28:11.058 --> 28:14.427
In this place.

28:14.511 --> 28:18.047
I'm glad you're alive.

28:18.098 --> 28:22.401
You don't know what it means
to hear you say that...

28:22.486 --> 28:25.404
to have you close
to me again.

28:43.924 --> 28:45.875
Both:

28:58.429 --> 28:59.515
Hey.

29:00.493 --> 29:01.536
Hey.

29:03.889 --> 29:05.757
Sleep okay?

29:06.842 --> 29:09.894
I had a lot on my mind.

29:12.932 --> 29:15.633
Why don't I make coffee?

29:15.684 --> 29:18.302
- Helen--
- Please.

29:18.354 --> 29:21.305
I don't want to have
this conversation like this.

29:30.249 --> 29:31.583
Do you know how much
I wished for this?

29:31.650 --> 29:33.451
You and me together
in the morning,

29:33.502 --> 29:37.505
just drinking coffee.

29:37.590 --> 29:40.425
Yeah, it's not fair for me
to do this to you.

29:40.492 --> 29:42.177
It's not fair for me to try
to make this work.

29:42.261 --> 29:43.845
When you're still in love
with someone else.

29:44.964 --> 29:47.348
What we had in Rome
was real.

29:47.433 --> 29:49.000
I never would have let
last night happen

29:49.051 --> 29:50.268
if it wasn't.

29:50.335 --> 29:54.355
But it's not the same
for you now.

29:54.440 --> 29:56.024
No.

29:56.108 --> 29:58.309
I can't pretend
I didn't know that.

29:58.360 --> 30:01.312
I just wanted
to get us back.

30:03.566 --> 30:07.152
My heart broke for you.

30:07.203 --> 30:09.020
But you did give me the chance
to let someone else in,

30:09.071 --> 30:12.574
and I just want you to have
that same chance.

30:12.658 --> 30:14.409
Incoming call.

30:14.493 --> 30:16.995
Eric Barber.

30:17.046 --> 30:18.163
If he's calling
this time of the day,

30:18.214 --> 30:20.165
it must be important.

30:20.216 --> 30:23.334
You should take it.

30:23.385 --> 30:25.003
Thanks.

30:25.054 --> 30:26.921
Yeah, Barber,
what do you got?

30:27.006 --> 30:28.306
You wanted me to let you know
if Calder made

30:28.373 --> 30:29.333
any sudden moves, right?

30:29.374 --> 30:30.308
Yeah.

30:30.375 --> 30:31.476
Well, here's one.

30:31.543 --> 30:32.560
He's organizing a team
to check out

30:32.645 --> 30:34.312
a fortified cabin

30:34.379 --> 30:36.014
somewhere out in the sticks
first thing this morning.

30:36.065 --> 30:37.515
Someplace called Hillcrest.

30:37.566 --> 30:38.606
How did he find Hillcrest?

30:38.684 --> 30:39.884
That's above my clearance,
man.

30:39.902 --> 30:40.985
All I know is he's leaving
within the hour.

30:41.053 --> 30:42.187
All right, listen.

30:42.238 --> 30:43.938
I need you to get yourself
on that team.

30:44.023 --> 30:45.156
Yeah, done and done.
He needs a tech guy.

30:45.224 --> 30:46.891
Call me immediately
when you get back.

30:46.942 --> 30:49.994
Let me know what you find.

30:50.062 --> 30:52.080
Barber said they found
a cabin at Hillcrest.

30:52.164 --> 30:53.581
Is that important?

30:53.666 --> 30:55.416
Annie and I were out there
four months ago.

30:55.501 --> 30:56.618
I knew we missed something.

30:56.702 --> 30:58.586
She must have found something
this time.

30:58.671 --> 30:59.787
I need to get
back to my apartment.

30:59.872 --> 31:01.289
I gotta scrub
through that laptop data.

31:01.373 --> 31:04.125
Maybe there's a reference
I missed.

31:04.210 --> 31:06.344
Of course.

31:06.411 --> 31:07.512
- Helen--
- Go.

31:07.579 --> 31:10.515
It's the right thing
for both of us.

31:17.273 --> 31:19.474
Jones, Marshall,
circle around the flank.

31:19.558 --> 31:22.477
Rittenhauer, Simms,
disable security.

31:33.772 --> 31:36.708
Barber, behind the trees.

31:43.132 --> 31:46.084
Fall back!

31:57.763 --> 31:58.680
Everybody okay?

31:58.764 --> 32:01.683
Yeah.

32:08.640 --> 32:10.441
I was told Braithwaite
wanted to see me.

32:10.492 --> 32:12.327
He's indisposed.

32:12.411 --> 32:14.529
What were you doing
at Hillcrest,

32:14.613 --> 32:15.580
at my cabin?

32:15.647 --> 32:17.365
I had no idea
it was your cabin.

32:17.449 --> 32:19.367
But you went up there
for a reason.

32:19.451 --> 32:20.835
And you set it to explode
for a reason.

32:20.920 --> 32:22.587
We're lucky no one was killed.

32:22.654 --> 32:25.006
I'm not going to apologize
for defending my property.

32:25.090 --> 32:26.424
- Is that what you call it?
- I want to know

32:26.491 --> 32:27.491
why my cabin in the woods

32:27.509 --> 32:29.460
is of such great interest
to you.

32:29.511 --> 32:31.679
I was following
your suggestion.

32:31.764 --> 32:34.632
You asked me to find
Jessica Matthews.

32:34.683 --> 32:36.301
She led me there.
And where is she now?

32:36.352 --> 32:38.553
I lost her in the woods.

32:38.637 --> 32:39.887
Convenient for both of you.

32:39.972 --> 32:41.606
You might want to check
your security cameras.

32:41.673 --> 32:43.341
If I thought
you were a liar,

32:43.392 --> 32:46.060
you would already be
back in Medellin.

32:46.145 --> 32:48.980
You realize that I wouldn't put
anyone in a job

32:49.031 --> 32:51.065
if I couldn't get them out
swiftly.

32:51.150 --> 32:52.450
I think you know
what I'm talking about.

32:52.517 --> 32:54.235
Yeah, I know
what you're talking about.

32:54.320 --> 32:55.620
What did she look like?

32:55.687 --> 32:57.238
Didn't get a great look.

32:57.323 --> 32:59.357
Caucasian, dark hair.
That's all I saw.

32:59.408 --> 33:02.293
You need to do better
than that.

33:02.361 --> 33:03.544
Find her again.

33:03.629 --> 33:05.330
This time,

33:05.381 --> 33:09.050
don't worry
about bringing her back.

33:09.134 --> 33:12.053
Yes, sir.

33:18.710 --> 33:19.831
What'd you find
at the cabin?

33:19.845 --> 33:21.262
Ashes.

33:21.347 --> 33:23.765
Went off like a bomb.

33:23.849 --> 33:25.566
Henry knows
we're on to him.

33:25.651 --> 33:27.185
If he didn't,
he knows now.

33:27.236 --> 33:28.603
What do you mean?

33:28.687 --> 33:30.405
He knows you
were at the cabin.

33:30.489 --> 33:32.657
- You gave me up?
- I gave Jessica Matthews up.

33:32.724 --> 33:34.192
- Why?
- The truth bought us space.

33:34.243 --> 33:36.911
I told him
Jessica led me there.

33:36.996 --> 33:39.914
You are already here.

33:46.205 --> 33:47.955
Who's in there?

33:48.040 --> 33:49.207
Not you.

33:49.258 --> 33:50.708
And if she's ever exhumed,

33:50.759 --> 33:51.909
we'll both be in trouble.

33:51.960 --> 33:56.381
They'll be digging
two more of these.

33:56.432 --> 33:59.384
We're in this together, Walker.
Never forget that.

34:02.587 --> 34:04.605
What was Henry's reaction
when you told him

34:04.690 --> 34:06.474
Jessica Matthews
was at his cabin?

34:06.558 --> 34:08.893
Shit, never saw him
so angry.

34:08.944 --> 34:10.445
The pressure we're putting
on him is working.

34:10.529 --> 34:11.612
We have to keep it up.

34:11.697 --> 34:12.980
Yeah.

34:13.065 --> 34:14.985
You going to New York
to track down Nelson Smith?

34:15.067 --> 34:17.452
It's better
I don't tell you.

34:17.536 --> 34:20.455
Take this.
No serial number.

34:22.991 --> 34:24.292
You know, I saw the look
in his eye.

34:24.376 --> 34:26.661
It's not a question
of if he finds you.

34:26.745 --> 34:29.664
It's a question of when.

34:45.797 --> 34:48.733
Come out, or I'll shoot
and ask questions later.

34:57.836 --> 34:59.628
It was you following Calder.

34:59.629 --> 35:02.398
I tracked Henry to Geneva
for Joan and Arthur.

35:02.466 --> 35:03.816
I saw you there.

35:03.901 --> 35:05.935
I know
about Jessica Matthews.

35:05.986 --> 35:07.307
Do Joan and Arthur know
I'm alive?

35:07.570 --> 35:09.806
- No.
- Did you tell Auggie

35:09.807 --> 35:10.940
you saw me?

35:11.008 --> 35:15.278
I promised him I'd keep
your secret.

35:15.345 --> 35:18.481
Look at us.
Two ghosts in a graveyard.

35:18.532 --> 35:20.450
Do you have any information
about a cipher?

35:20.517 --> 35:21.484
The one from the computer?

35:21.535 --> 35:22.819
No.

35:22.870 --> 35:25.321
I gave it to Calder
because I can't break it.

35:25.372 --> 35:27.490
Auggie's working on it.
He's very good.

35:27.541 --> 35:29.042
Yeah.

35:29.126 --> 35:31.327
I saw you with him.

35:31.378 --> 35:33.630
Are you here to tell me
I should stay dead?

35:33.697 --> 35:35.415
No.

35:35.499 --> 35:38.585
But you just need to know,
the longer you stay dark,

35:38.669 --> 35:41.554
the harder it gets
to come back.

35:41.639 --> 35:45.341
Thanks.

35:45.392 --> 35:49.229
Auggie's still in love
with you, Annie.

35:49.313 --> 35:51.547
If you have any desire
to be back with him,

35:51.599 --> 35:54.550
don't wait too long.

36:01.391 --> 36:04.327
Run it again.

36:09.566 --> 36:12.401
Anderson, let's do this.

36:12.453 --> 36:14.287
Thanks for telling me
about Hillcrest.

36:14.371 --> 36:15.755
Don't worry.
You didn't miss much.

36:15.839 --> 36:16.906
Cute.

36:16.957 --> 36:18.574
Did you bring the pictures
Annie took

36:18.626 --> 36:19.575
of Henry's cabin?

36:19.627 --> 36:20.760
Got 'em right here.

36:20.844 --> 36:22.679
You see any books in there

36:22.746 --> 36:26.432
on a table or a bookcase or--

36:26.517 --> 36:27.467
- There's a bookshelf.
- Yeah, great.

36:27.551 --> 36:28.801
What's on it?

36:28.886 --> 36:30.687
- Want the titles of the books?
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.

36:30.754 --> 36:32.605
We got Machiavelli's
<i>The Prince,</i>

36:32.690 --> 36:34.274
<i>The Art of War</i>
<i>by Sun Tzu,</i>

36:34.358 --> 36:36.976
<i>Ideas Have Consequences</i>
<i>by Richard Weaver,</i>

36:37.061 --> 36:40.113
uh, "Le Bible,"
a Bible in French,

36:40.197 --> 36:43.199
Graham Greene's
<i>Our Man in Havana--</i>

36:43.267 --> 36:44.934
Wait a minute, why--

36:44.985 --> 36:46.703
why does Henry have
a Bible in French?

36:46.770 --> 36:49.438
Good question.

36:49.490 --> 36:54.043
<i>Vie nouvelle.</i>

36:54.111 --> 36:55.378
- What?
- Hold on.

36:55.445 --> 36:58.081
In the evidence photos

36:58.132 --> 37:00.116
of Deric Hughes's
hotel room,

37:00.167 --> 37:02.418
there was a French Bible
in the nightstand,

37:02.469 --> 37:04.387
but when I saw it, I figured it
was just a Gideons' Bible.

37:04.454 --> 37:05.955
No, we may have just found
the key

37:06.006 --> 37:10.143
to our one-time pad.

37:10.227 --> 37:11.394
I was able to find
the surveillance camera

37:11.461 --> 37:12.762
from the bridge
you were looking for

37:12.813 --> 37:14.314
by Cape Hillcrest,
Mr. Wilcox.

37:14.398 --> 37:16.316
Were you able to isolate
the hours I requested?

37:16.400 --> 37:17.317
Yes, sir.
The link's already up.

37:17.401 --> 37:20.320
Good.

37:23.691 --> 37:26.642
Stop!
Punch in.

37:28.812 --> 37:30.663
Roll forward.

37:30.748 --> 37:32.415
How long is this gonna take?

37:32.482 --> 37:34.150
Look, it'd take
a hell of a lot longer

37:34.201 --> 37:35.368
without that algorithm.

37:35.452 --> 37:38.371
Just let the computer
do its work.

37:41.342 --> 37:42.292
There!

37:42.343 --> 37:45.295
Again, tighter.

37:47.598 --> 37:52.185
We need to find
this motorcycle.

37:52.269 --> 37:55.188
Here we go.

37:57.308 --> 37:58.891
"Stinger secured.

37:58.976 --> 38:00.676
"Need 10 million more
for Copenhagen.

38:00.728 --> 38:02.362
"Old account not viable.

38:02.446 --> 38:04.197
Send new instructions
to receive funds."

38:04.281 --> 38:05.615
This proves Deric Hughes
was involved

38:05.682 --> 38:07.200
in that Copenhagen attack.

38:07.284 --> 38:08.785
Yeah, but how do we prove
Henry's behind it?

38:08.852 --> 38:10.153
Nelson Smith, I hope.

38:10.204 --> 38:12.038
Yeah.

38:12.122 --> 38:15.041
Good work, Auggie.

38:44.655 --> 38:47.106
New York.

38:56.566 --> 38:59.502
Thanks.

39:58.762 --> 40:01.347
Ms. Hansen.
Isn't this a pleasure?

40:01.432 --> 40:03.065
I've been wanting to meet you
ever since I saw photos

40:03.133 --> 40:07.487
of you with Arthur Campbell
and Teo Braga.

40:07.571 --> 40:09.906
You've been doing
Arthur Campbell's dirty work

40:09.973 --> 40:11.157
for him, haven't you?

40:11.241 --> 40:12.859
Long enough to know
you're guilty

40:12.943 --> 40:14.193
for what happened
in Copenhagen,

40:14.278 --> 40:16.479
Medellin, and Geneva.

40:16.530 --> 40:17.930
Long enough to know
you'll never get

40:17.948 --> 40:19.782
your ex-wife, Sana, back.

40:19.833 --> 40:22.201
And long enough to know
how much that destroys you.

40:22.286 --> 40:25.288
I don't know what you're
talking about, Ms. Hansen.

40:25.339 --> 40:28.291
Or do you prefer
Jessica Matthews?

40:34.264 --> 40:36.665
That's right.
I'm Jessica Matthews.

40:36.717 --> 40:38.468
You've found me.

40:38.519 --> 40:39.685
But it doesn't matter, Henry.

40:39.770 --> 40:42.688
What we have on you is enough
to bring--

41:04.995 --> 41:07.914
Shut it down.
Shut everything down.

41:16.423 --> 41:19.725
- Somebody call 911.
- She's dead.

41:21.395 --> 41:24.347
Oh, my gosh.

41:56.213 --> 41:59.131
Who is it?

41:59.156 --> 42:04.156
