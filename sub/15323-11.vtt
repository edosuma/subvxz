WEBVTT

00:00.127 --> 00:01.652
HOW DID THAT GUN
GET IN YOUR CAR?

00:01.652 --> 00:04.369
THE PERSON WHO KILLED LOU.
YOU KNOW WHO THAT WAS?

00:04.369 --> 00:06.271
<i>PREVIOUSLY ON "BETRAYAL"...</i>

00:06.271 --> 00:08.239
IT'S DELICIOUS.
YOU DON'T LIKE IT.

00:08.239 --> 00:09.641
YOU DON'T HAVE TO LIE
JUST TO BE NICE.

00:09.641 --> 00:12.644
ISN'T IT CRAZY
HOW WOMEN ALWAYS DO THAT?

00:12.644 --> 00:15.647
I KNOW WHO KILLED UNCLE LOU,
AND I THINK YOU DO, TOO, DAD.

00:15.647 --> 00:17.382
DO YOU REMEMBER THAT NIGHT
WHEN YOU CALLED ME

00:17.382 --> 00:18.783
ASKING FOR HELP
TO FIND THE MAGIC BOOK?

00:18.783 --> 00:21.920
LOU MROZEK
WAS KILLED THAT NIGHT.

00:21.920 --> 00:24.322
JACK WAS STANDING NEXT TO ME
WHEN I TALKED TO YOU.

00:24.322 --> 00:26.057
I'M HERE TO MAKE A CONFESSION.

00:26.057 --> 00:30.094
I KILLED LOU MROZEK.

00:30.094 --> 00:32.597
I HEAR
YOU HAVE SOMETHING TO SAY

00:32.597 --> 00:35.600
ABOUT THE MROZEK MURDER.

00:35.600 --> 00:38.603
IT WAS ME.

00:38.603 --> 00:40.171
I KILLED LOU MROZEK.

00:40.171 --> 00:44.108
IS THAT SO?

00:47.745 --> 00:50.081
START AT THE BEGINNING.

00:52.817 --> 00:56.654
LOU WAS EMBEZZLING
FROM KARSTEN ALLIED.

00:56.654 --> 00:58.323
IT HAD BEEN GOING ON
FOR A WHILE.

00:58.323 --> 01:01.659
IT WAS OVER $1 MILLION
BEFORE WE FIGURED IT OUT.

01:01.659 --> 01:03.528
I CONFRONTED HIM
ONE NIGHT.

01:03.528 --> 01:06.030
THINGS GOT HEATED.

01:06.030 --> 01:07.865
I DIDN'T KNOW
HE CARRIED A GUN.

01:07.865 --> 01:09.267
FOR PROTECTION?

01:09.267 --> 01:12.770
WELL,
HE WAS PARANOID, JUMPY.

01:12.770 --> 01:14.305
IT WAS STUPID ON MY PART.

01:14.305 --> 01:17.609
I SHOULD HAVE ANTICIPATED IT,
BUT THE GUN SURPRISED ME.

01:17.609 --> 01:20.645
HE POINTED IT
AT MY CHEST.

01:20.645 --> 01:21.980
WITHOUT EVEN THINKING,
I LUNGED,

01:21.980 --> 01:25.216
WRESTLED IT FROM HIS HANDS,
AND SHOT HIM.

01:25.216 --> 01:28.720
IT WASN'T...RATIONAL.
IT WAS LIKE A REFLEX.

01:28.720 --> 01:32.390
WHAT ABOUT T.J. KARSTEN?
WAS HE WITH YOU?

01:32.390 --> 01:35.226
I DIDN'T TELL T.J.,
BUT I FOLLOWED HIM
FROM THE RESTAURANT.

01:35.226 --> 01:36.728
WHY?

01:36.728 --> 01:39.230
WELL, 'CAUSE T.J. WAS EMOTIONAL.
LOU WAS UNDER SIEGE.

01:39.230 --> 01:42.233
I WANTED TO MAKE SURE
THINGS DIDN'T ESCALATE.

01:42.233 --> 01:44.402
BUT THEY DID?

01:44.402 --> 01:46.137
BUT NOT UNTIL
AFTER T.J. LEFT.

01:46.137 --> 01:48.806
THAT'S WHEN
I APPROACHED LOU MYSELF.

01:48.806 --> 01:50.408
AND THAT'S WHEN
YOU SHOT HIM?

01:50.408 --> 01:51.743
YES.

01:51.743 --> 01:54.045
LIKE I TOLD YOU,
IT WAS IN SELF-DEFENSE.

01:54.045 --> 01:59.150
SO...TO THE BEST
OF YOUR RECOLLECTION,

01:59.150 --> 02:02.053
THESE ARE THE EVENTS
THAT TOOK PLACE

02:02.053 --> 02:04.856
ON THE NIGHT
OF SEPTEMBER 27, 2013?

02:04.856 --> 02:08.192
YES.

02:08.192 --> 02:10.728
I SWEAR, I JUST
WANTED TO TALK TO HIM.

02:10.728 --> 02:12.330
UH-HUH.

02:12.330 --> 02:15.667
AND THINGS
GOT OUT OF HAND.

02:21.739 --> 02:25.410
YEAH. I GUESS YOU COULD SAY
THINGS GOT OUT OF HAND.

02:28.946 --> 02:31.949
-- Captions by VITAC --

02:53.805 --> 02:56.307
SORRY
TO BOTHER YOU AGAIN.

02:56.307 --> 02:57.809
HE DOESN'T
WANT TO SEE YOU.

02:57.809 --> 03:00.311
WELL, TELL HIM
THAT I'M STILL HERE

03:00.311 --> 03:02.146
AND THAT I'M NOT LEAVING
UNTIL HE LETS ME IN.

03:02.146 --> 03:04.649
YEAH, YOU'VE BEEN HERE
ALL MORNING.

03:04.649 --> 03:06.818
I THINK YOU SHOULD
PROBABLY GO HOME.

03:21.432 --> 03:22.934
HI.

03:22.934 --> 03:25.803
I'M HERE TO SEE,
UH, JACK McALLISTER.

03:25.803 --> 03:28.906
POPULAR GUY.

03:33.411 --> 03:36.381
CAN I SEE YOUR I.D.?

03:38.483 --> 03:41.319
YES.

03:41.319 --> 03:44.722
I'M ELAINE McALLISTER.
I'M HIS WIFE.

03:46.357 --> 03:49.026
OKAY. WAIT HERE.

03:49.026 --> 03:51.529
THANK YOU.

04:18.823 --> 04:21.859
ELAINE, I --
DON'T.

04:21.859 --> 04:24.061
THERE'S NOTHING TO SAY.

04:30.034 --> 04:34.405
ACTUALLY, I'M WONDERING.

04:34.405 --> 04:37.675
WHY DID YOU
COME TO MY RESTAURANT?

04:39.210 --> 04:41.312
WHAT DID YOU WANT?

04:41.312 --> 04:44.148
I'M SORRY.

04:44.148 --> 04:45.650
I DON'T WANT
YOUR APOLOGY.

04:45.650 --> 04:48.085
I JUST WANT TO KNOW.
WHAT THE HELL DID YOU WANT?

04:52.156 --> 04:55.493
I GUESS I WANTED TO
KNOW MORE ABOUT JACK.

04:57.929 --> 05:00.598
ABOUT HIS MARRIAGE?

05:00.598 --> 05:02.600
YOU CAN GO IN.

05:05.937 --> 05:08.206
HOW DID THAT
WORK OUT FOR YOU?

05:22.787 --> 05:25.122
THIS IS ABOUT T.J.,
ISN'T IT?

05:25.122 --> 05:26.791
NO.

05:26.791 --> 05:28.693
T.J. SHOT HIM
AND YOU WERE THERE.

05:28.693 --> 05:32.029
YOU'RE COVERING FOR HIM.
NO, I SWEAR.

05:32.029 --> 05:35.867
JACK, YOU DIDN'T DO THIS.
I KNOW YOU.

05:35.867 --> 05:37.068
DO YOU?

05:37.068 --> 05:40.137
AFTER ALL THAT'S HAPPENED,
CAN YOU REALLY SAY THAT?

05:43.975 --> 05:46.143
NO. I GUESS NOT.

05:48.079 --> 05:51.415
LOU PULLED A GUN.
I HAD NO CHOICE.

05:51.415 --> 05:56.254
SO, YOU'RE SAYING
THAT YOU SHOT LOU

05:56.254 --> 05:58.322
AND YOU LET T.J.
TAKE THE FALL FOR IT?

05:58.322 --> 06:00.157
I KNEW
THE CHARGES WOULDN'T HOLD.

06:00.157 --> 06:03.160
WELL, MY BROTHER
WENT TO JAIL FOR YOU.
T.J. UNDERSTANDS.

06:03.160 --> 06:05.663
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?
WAS HE IN ON IT?

06:05.663 --> 06:07.665
NO.

06:09.166 --> 06:12.169
SO, WHY ARE YOU
CONFESSING THIS NOW?

06:12.169 --> 06:14.305
THEY'RE TAKING ANOTHER LOOK
AT THE CASE.

06:14.305 --> 06:17.475
I DIDN'T WANT TO RISK IT.
T.J.'s BEEN THROUGH ENOUGH.

06:19.143 --> 06:22.747
LOOK...
I KNOW THIS IS A LOT.

06:22.747 --> 06:26.717
BUT I HOPE
SOMEDAY YOU'LL UNDERSTAND.

06:28.853 --> 06:30.354
I DOUBT IT.

06:36.694 --> 06:38.195
I NEED TO GO.

06:40.798 --> 06:44.135
YOU KNOW THE KIDS
ARE VERY UPSET.

06:44.135 --> 06:45.770
YOU TELL THEM
I LOVE THEM, OKAY?

06:47.471 --> 06:49.473
OKAY.

06:49.473 --> 06:51.809
BYE, JACK.

06:59.483 --> 07:02.320
<i>KARSTEN ALLIED'S FORMER</i>
<i>TOP ATTORNEY JACK McALLISTER</i>

07:02.320 --> 07:04.155

I SAID TURN IT OFF.

07:12.163 --> 07:14.999

07:14.999 --> 07:17.001
GOD.

07:17.001 --> 07:19.170
ALL THIS TIME,
I'VE JUST KEPT TELLING MYSELF

07:19.170 --> 07:22.840
THAT HE WAS DIFFERENT,
THAT HE'S ONE OF THE GOOD GUYS.

07:22.840 --> 07:24.208
HE STILL IS.

07:24.208 --> 07:27.411
WHY ARE YOU DEFENDING HIM
ALL OF A SUDDEN?

07:29.313 --> 07:32.683
DAD'S JUST
ANOTHER KARSTEN THUG.

07:32.683 --> 07:36.854
SHUT UP. I MEAN,
YOU JUST DON'T GET IT.

07:38.756 --> 07:41.592
HEY.

07:41.592 --> 07:42.793
HEY.
IS HE ALL RIGHT?

07:45.096 --> 07:47.598
YEAH. HE SAYS
HE LOVES YOU BOTH.

07:51.235 --> 07:53.671
AND ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?

07:53.671 --> 07:57.174
I HAVE NO IDEA.

07:57.174 --> 07:59.844
I WILL BE, I THINK.

07:59.844 --> 08:01.779
COULD WE GO VISIT HIM?
NO.

08:01.779 --> 08:03.614
I WANT TO SEE HIM.

08:03.614 --> 08:05.783
MAYBE IN A FEW DAYS.

08:05.783 --> 08:09.086
HE WAS PROTECTING HIMSELF.
IT'S JUSTIFIED.

08:09.086 --> 08:10.254
WAKE UP, OKAY?

08:10.254 --> 08:12.857
HE KILLED OUR UNCLE.
HE'S BEEN LYING TO ALL OF US.

08:12.857 --> 08:14.258
HE'S OUR DAD!
VIC, YOU'RE AN IDIOT.

08:14.258 --> 08:15.526
I MEAN, HOW CAN YOU JUST
TURN ON HIM LIKE THIS?
GUYS.

08:15.526 --> 08:17.261
HOW CAN YOU BE ON HIS SIDE?
ENOUGH! ENOUGH! ENOUGH.

08:17.261 --> 08:19.230
LISTEN,
IF THERE'S ONE THING --

08:19.230 --> 08:21.465
THE ONLY THING --
THAT I'M CERTAIN OF

08:21.465 --> 08:24.468
IT'S THAT WE HAVE
GOT TO STICK TOGETHER

08:24.468 --> 08:26.904
IF WE'RE GONNA
GET THROUGH THIS.

08:28.205 --> 08:30.875
YEAH, WELL,
THEN MAYBE WE WON'T.

08:46.490 --> 08:49.160
THESE REALLY NECESSARY?

08:49.160 --> 08:52.329
TURNS OUT
YOU'RE A VIOLENT OFFENDER.

08:52.329 --> 08:53.798
WHAT ARE
YOU DOING HERE?

08:53.798 --> 08:56.801
BACK ON THE CASE.

08:56.801 --> 09:00.137
REWARD
FOR NOT GIVING UP.

09:05.943 --> 09:10.448
NOW...I WANT TO KNOW
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

09:10.448 --> 09:11.749
I ALREADY
GAVE MY STATEMENT.

09:11.749 --> 09:13.117
I READ IT.
IT'S A GOOD STORY.

09:13.117 --> 09:15.186
GUY WITH A STORY LIKE THAT
COULD WALK OUT OF HERE

09:15.186 --> 09:17.655
WITH NO JAIL TIME, BUT SOMEHOW,
SOMETHING DOESN'T SEEM RIGHT.

09:17.655 --> 09:20.157
OH, IT NEVER DOES WITH YOU.
BUT IT'S THE TRUTH.

09:20.157 --> 09:21.492
YOU SURE ABOUT THAT?

09:21.492 --> 09:23.294
'CAUSE I HAVE
EVIDENCE AGAINST YOU --

09:23.294 --> 09:25.463
EVIDENCE THAT COULD PUT YOU AWAY
FOR A LONG TIME.

09:25.463 --> 09:27.298
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
WHAT EVIDENCE?

09:27.298 --> 09:30.634
I HAVE EVIDENCE OF MOTIVE
AND PREMEDITATION --

09:30.634 --> 09:32.536
EVIDENCE THAT MAKES
YOUR SELF-DEFENSE PLEA

09:32.536 --> 09:34.205
LOOK LIKE A JOKE.

09:34.205 --> 09:36.373
YEAH, YOU'RE LYING.

09:36.373 --> 09:39.210
NO.
BUT I THINK YOU ARE.

09:39.210 --> 09:41.979
YOU KNOW, FROM NOW ON,
YOU SPEAK TO MY LAWYER.

09:52.690 --> 09:55.693
SARA'S STILL WAITING OUTSIDE,
YOU KNOW.

09:55.693 --> 09:58.362
SHE'S BEEN SITTING THERE
FOR HOURS.

10:10.808 --> 10:12.476
OKAY.

10:16.447 --> 10:18.115
HE'LL SEE YOU NOW.

10:35.566 --> 10:37.067
WHAT'S GOING ON?

10:37.067 --> 10:39.436
SARA --
WHY WOULDN'T YOU SEE ME?

10:39.436 --> 10:41.772
I DIDN'T KNOW
WHAT TO SAY.

10:41.772 --> 10:43.407
THIS MAKES NO SENSE.

10:43.407 --> 10:47.077
I WAS WITH YOU THAT NIGHT,
SEPTEMBER 27th, DUNE ACRES.

10:47.077 --> 10:49.079
NO. NO, YOU'VE GOT
THE DATES MIXED UP.

10:49.079 --> 10:51.582
JACK,
YOU DIDN'T SHOOT ANYONE.

10:51.582 --> 10:54.418
I UNDERSTAND WHY YOU'RE
TRYING TO COVER FOR ME,

10:54.418 --> 10:56.287
BUT THERE'S NO NEED
FOR THAT NOW.

10:56.287 --> 10:59.223
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

10:59.223 --> 11:02.059
<i>I'M COMING CLEAN.</i>

11:02.059 --> 11:03.694
<i>IT'S NOT POSSIBLE.</i>

11:03.694 --> 11:05.863
<i>LOOK, I'VE HIRED A LAWYER,</i>
<i>AND IT'S GONNA BE OKAY.</i>

11:05.863 --> 11:07.531
<i>NO, IT'S NOT.</i>
<i>NOTHING ABOUT THIS IS OKAY.</i>

11:07.531 --> 11:09.700
<i>SARA.</i>
<i>YOU PROMISED.</i>

11:09.700 --> 11:11.302
YOU PROMISED
YOU WOULDN'T SHUT ME OUT.

11:11.302 --> 11:14.471
I SHOT HIM, ALL RIGHT?
IN SELF-DEFENSE.

11:14.471 --> 11:16.740
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

11:19.743 --> 11:23.414
LISTEN TO ME,
THERE'S A REASON FOR EVERYTHING.

11:51.890 --> 11:55.227
I TOLD YOU
I DON'T WANT IT.

11:55.227 --> 11:56.862
FOR YOUR MORTGAGE.

11:56.862 --> 11:59.832
THE KIDS' TUITION.

12:01.433 --> 12:03.435
JACK COULD GO AWAY
FOR A VERY LONG TIME,

12:03.435 --> 12:04.737
YOU KNOW THAT?

12:04.737 --> 12:07.172
I HAVEN'T NEEDED YOUR HELP
BEFORE. I DON'T NEED IT NOW.

12:10.075 --> 12:12.745
I'M SUCH AN IDIOT.

12:12.745 --> 12:14.913
NOTHING EVER CHANGES.

12:14.913 --> 12:16.682
EVERYTHING
THAT'S GOING ON,

12:16.682 --> 12:19.084
THE MESS THAT OUR FAMILY
IS IN RIGHT NOW,

12:19.084 --> 12:22.421
IT IS TERRIFYING
AND DESTRUCTIVE,

12:22.421 --> 12:24.390
AND IT ALL
COMES BACK TO YOU.

12:24.390 --> 12:27.226
I DON'T WANT IT.

12:27.226 --> 12:28.694
THAT'S INCREDIBLE.

12:28.694 --> 12:31.196
NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS,

12:31.196 --> 12:33.098
YOU ALWAYS FIND A WAY
TO MAKE IT MY FAULT.

12:33.098 --> 12:37.736
LOOK, LAINIE, JACK IS NOT
THE MAN WE THOUGHT HE WAS.

12:37.736 --> 12:40.506
THAT SHOULD BE
FAIRLY OBVIOUS BY NOW.

12:40.506 --> 12:44.176
HE BETRAYED ALL OF US --
T.J., ME, YOU --

12:44.176 --> 12:45.377
NO.
...ESPECIALLY YOU.

12:45.377 --> 12:46.879
WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT THAT.
THAT'S NOT IT.

12:46.879 --> 12:49.048
THEN WHAT ARE WE
TALKING ABOUT?

12:49.048 --> 12:51.750
IT'S NOT AS SIMPLE
AS YOU THINK.

12:51.750 --> 12:53.419
THE VERY FACT THAT THEY ARRESTED
HIM MEANS THAT THEY --

12:53.419 --> 12:57.122
JACK WASN'T ARRESTED.
HE WENT IN AND CONFESSED.

12:57.122 --> 12:59.058
DID HE?

12:59.058 --> 13:01.226
HE TOLD THE POLICE
EVERYTHING.

13:01.226 --> 13:04.663
JACK SHOT HIM BECAUSE
HE WAS DEFENDING HIMSELF.

13:06.799 --> 13:09.635
SO, HE'S GOING TO
PLEAD SELF-DEFENSE?

13:09.635 --> 13:11.303
YES.

13:11.303 --> 13:13.806
AND WITH ANY LUCK,
MAYBE HE WON'T DO ANY TIME.

13:13.806 --> 13:15.641
SO AT THE VERY LEAST,

13:15.641 --> 13:18.143
MAYBE YOUR GRANDCHILDREN
WON'T LOSE THEIR FATHER.

13:19.745 --> 13:22.648
I REALLY GOT TO GO TO WORK.
SEE YOURSELF OUT.

13:27.553 --> 13:29.822
DREW.

13:29.822 --> 13:33.492
OLLIE GOT PICKED UP EARLY
FOR CARPOOL.

13:33.492 --> 13:34.660
YES, I REMEMBERED
HIS HOMEWORK.

13:34.660 --> 13:37.129
YEAH, ACTUALLY,
I WAS HOPING TO CATCH YOU.

13:37.129 --> 13:41.166
WELL, I GOT TO LEAVE
IN A MINUTE, BUT SHOOT.

13:41.166 --> 13:43.736
JACK'S INNOCENT.
I THINK YOU KNOW THAT.

13:43.736 --> 13:47.072
HE CONFESSED, SARA.

13:47.072 --> 13:48.440
HE DID MOST OF THE WORK
FOR US.

13:48.440 --> 13:50.275
HE PLACED HIMSELF
AT THE SCENE OF THE CRIME.

13:50.275 --> 13:51.443
YEAH, BUT HE COULDN'T
HAVE DONE IT.

13:51.443 --> 13:53.779
BECAUSE HE WAS
IN DUNE ACRES WITH ME.

13:53.779 --> 13:57.449
I'M TELLING YOU
THE TRUTH.

13:57.449 --> 13:59.051
OR MAYBE
YOU'RE JUST SAYING

13:59.051 --> 14:01.153
WHAT YOU NEED TO SAY
TO COVER FOR HIM.

14:01.153 --> 14:03.122
IT WOULDN'T BE
THE FIRST TIME.
I'M NOT. I PROMISE.

14:03.122 --> 14:06.658
LOOK, EVEN IF I BELIEVED YOU,
NOBODY ELSE WOULD.

14:06.658 --> 14:09.261
JACK WON'T EVEN GO ALONG
WITH YOUR STORY.

14:09.261 --> 14:12.664
YOUR TRYING TO SAVE A MAN
THAT DOESN'T WANT TO BE SAVED.

14:12.664 --> 14:15.300
WHY? I DON'T KNOW.
I DON'T REALLY CARE.

14:15.300 --> 14:18.804
LOOK, I AM SORRY TO PUT YOU
IN THIS POSITION.

14:18.804 --> 14:21.907
I AM TRYING TO
SOLVE A CRIME, SARA.

14:21.907 --> 14:24.576
WITHOUT HARD EVIDENCE,
YOUR WORD IS...

14:24.576 --> 14:27.813
WELL, THE LEGAL TERM
IS "UNRELIABLE."

14:27.813 --> 14:30.082
I HAVE TO TAKE THIS.
I'LL TALK TO YOU LATER.

14:32.951 --> 14:34.119
HELLO?

14:39.491 --> 14:41.326
NEW INFORMATION HAS BEEN
BROUGHT TO LIGHT.

14:41.326 --> 14:43.162
OUR INVESTIGATION
IS EVOLVING.

14:43.162 --> 14:44.530
Don't give me that.

14:44.530 --> 14:46.365
WHY DIDN'T YOU
CHARGE HIM WITH MURDER?

14:46.365 --> 14:48.033
I'M SORRY --
I CAN'T DISCUSS

14:48.033 --> 14:49.868
ANY DETAILS OF THE CASE
AT THIS TIME.

14:49.868 --> 14:52.504
YOU DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A CASE
TILL I GAVE YOU ONE.

14:52.504 --> 14:55.507
HE'S MAKING UP
THIS SELF-DEFENSE CRAP

14:55.507 --> 14:57.843
TO AVOID BEING
INDICTED FOR MURDER.

14:57.843 --> 14:59.845
ANY IDIOT
COULD SEE THAT.

14:59.845 --> 15:01.513
We are pursuing
every possible theory

15:01.513 --> 15:03.182
AND EVERY LEAD
INTO THIS CRIME.

15:03.182 --> 15:04.416
Now, you listen to me.

15:04.416 --> 15:07.553
JACK McALLISTER'S
THE BEST LIAR YOU EVER MET.

15:07.553 --> 15:09.188
HE'S STILL PLAYING YOU,

15:09.188 --> 15:11.857
AND YOU'RE LETTING HIM
GET AWAY WITH IT.

15:11.857 --> 15:13.692
I need to go. Goodbye.

15:34.379 --> 15:38.050
IF YOU WANT TO JOIN ME,
YOU'RE WELCOME.

15:38.050 --> 15:41.119
I MEAN, NO PRESSURE, THOUGH.
I CAN GO ALONE.

16:11.917 --> 16:14.419
HELLO.

16:14.419 --> 16:16.288
NICE TO SEE YOU AGAIN.
HEY.

16:16.288 --> 16:17.789
HI.

16:17.789 --> 16:20.125
GOT A LOT OF BUSINESS
FROM YOUR STORY.

16:20.125 --> 16:23.328
OH, GOOD.
THAT'S GREAT.

16:26.832 --> 16:28.667
HOW DID YOUR SHOOT GO?

16:28.667 --> 16:32.838
WELL,
TURNS OUT DEAD FISH

16:32.838 --> 16:35.173
MAKE VERY COOPERATIVE
SUBJECTS.

16:37.175 --> 16:39.845
HOW DID YOU CHOOSE IT --
PHOTOGRAPHY?

16:39.845 --> 16:41.847
UH,
MY FATHER BOUGHT ME

16:41.847 --> 16:44.116
ONE OF THOSE INSTANT POLAROIDS
WHEN I WAS LITTLE.

16:46.385 --> 16:49.555
WHAT ABOUT YOU?
HOW DID YOU CHOOSE LAW?

16:49.555 --> 16:52.224
UM, KIND OF FELL INTO IT,
ACTUALLY.

16:52.224 --> 16:54.159
BUT I GUESS
I HAD A KNACK FOR IT.

16:54.159 --> 16:56.295
YOU KNOW,
PLANNING SEVERAL STEPS AHEAD

16:56.295 --> 16:59.965
AND PLANNING OUT EVERY
CONCEIVABLE WORST-CASE SCENARIO,

16:59.965 --> 17:02.134
PROTECTING AGAINST IT.

17:02.134 --> 17:04.803
HOW DO YOU PROTECT AGAINST
EVERY WORST-CASE SCENARIO?

17:04.803 --> 17:08.473
WELL, YOU START BY LOOKING
AT WHY WHAT HAPPENED.

17:08.473 --> 17:11.476
IF YOU KNOW WHERE TO LOOK,
THERE'S A REASON FOR EVERYTHING.

17:11.476 --> 17:12.611
ARE YOU OKAY?

17:12.611 --> 17:14.313
SORRY?

17:14.313 --> 17:16.982
YOU SHOULD COME INSIDE.

17:16.982 --> 17:19.851
WEATHER -- IT'S GOTTEN COLD.
YEAH.

17:19.851 --> 17:21.954
NOT LIKE
WHEN YOU WERE HERE BEFORE.

17:21.954 --> 17:25.924
WHAT WAS THAT?
THREE MONTHS AGO?

17:29.995 --> 17:32.998
SEEMS LIKE A LIFETIME.

17:39.972 --> 17:42.140
VIOLET.
DREW.

17:42.140 --> 17:44.142
JACK HIRING YOU
CAN ONLY MEAN ONE THING.

17:44.142 --> 17:45.811
IT'S WORSE THAN HE SAYS.

17:45.811 --> 17:48.146
ACTUALLY, JACK HIRED ME
MOSTLY OUT OF CONCERN

17:48.146 --> 17:50.983
OVER HOW RABID AND UNPRINCIPLED
HE THINKS YOU'VE BECOME.

17:50.983 --> 17:53.986
I CAN'T TELL YOU HOW LITTLE
I CARE WHAT HE THINKS.

17:53.986 --> 17:56.822
THE THING IS, I ALWAYS HEARD
YOU WERE ONE OF THE GOOD GUYS

17:56.822 --> 18:00.325
WHO'D RATHER SEE JUSTICE DONE
THAN WASTE EVERYONE'S TIME

18:00.325 --> 18:02.661
OVER OVERBLOWN CHARGES
THAT ARE NEVER GONNA HOLD.

18:02.661 --> 18:04.663
REMIND ME, HE CONFESSED,
RIGHT?

18:04.663 --> 18:06.665
TO SELF-DEFENSE,
NOT MURDER.

18:06.665 --> 18:08.333
GOT A CORPORATE FILE
THAT POINTS TO JACK

18:08.333 --> 18:10.836
HAVING EMBEZZLED $1 MILLION
AND A CORROBORATING INTERVIEW

18:10.836 --> 18:13.171
WITH THE ACCOUNTANT,
MATTHEW HENDRICKS.

18:13.171 --> 18:16.341
PROVIDED TO YOU BY?
YOU KNOW
I CAN'T TELL YOU THAT.

18:16.341 --> 18:18.677
IT'S GOT KARSTEN'S FINGERPRINTS
ALL OVER IT.

18:18.677 --> 18:20.345
NO COMMENT.

18:20.345 --> 18:23.548
YOU'VE GOT TESTIMONY
FROM A LOWLIFE ACCOUNTANT

18:23.548 --> 18:26.051
AND SHADY BOOKKEEPING
GIVEN TO YOU

18:26.051 --> 18:27.886
BY A CROOK
WITH A PERSONAL VENDETTA.

18:27.886 --> 18:29.955
IT'S HEARSAY,
IT'S CIRCUMSTANTIAL,

18:29.955 --> 18:32.691
AND WE BOTH KNOW
IT'S NOT ENOUGH FOR MURDER ONE.

18:32.691 --> 18:36.361
WELL, I GUESS WE'LL JUST SEE
WHAT THE JUDGE HAS TO SAY.

18:36.361 --> 18:39.865
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE NOT
HOW I PICTURED YOU.

18:39.865 --> 18:41.900
YOU'RE KIND OF CUTE,
ACTUALLY.

18:41.900 --> 18:45.437
YOU HAVE A REPUTATION
FOR BEING SO PRINCIPLED.

18:45.437 --> 18:48.206
SO IT MAKES ME SAD
TO SEE YOU GO FROM BEING

18:48.206 --> 18:51.243
AN ANTI-KARSTEN CRUSADER
TO THIS.

18:53.245 --> 18:56.415
CALL ME
IF YOUR CONSCIENCE RETURNS.

19:10.571 --> 19:11.872
HI.

19:11.872 --> 19:13.641
MY NAME'S SARA HANLEY.

19:13.641 --> 19:16.223
I WAS HOPING YOU KEPT A RECORD
OF MY STAY IN SEPTEMBER.

19:16.223 --> 19:18.559
OH, FROM SEPTEMBER, NO.

19:18.559 --> 19:20.895
BUT I CHECK
EVERY GUEST IN MYSELF,

19:20.895 --> 19:22.329
AND I NEVER FORGET A FACE.

19:22.329 --> 19:23.998
NOW, YOU,
YOU HAVE A VERY NICE FACE,

19:23.998 --> 19:25.499
BUT I DON'T REMEMBER IT.

19:25.499 --> 19:28.335
WELL, I DIDN'T COME UP
TO THE DESK.
OH.

19:28.335 --> 19:29.837
BUT...

19:31.772 --> 19:35.076
...HE DID.

19:35.076 --> 19:37.244
HMM.

19:37.244 --> 19:39.647
I CAN'T BE SURE.

19:39.647 --> 19:42.616
I...MIGHT REMEMBER HIM
A LITTLE BIT.

19:42.616 --> 19:43.918
I.D. AND CREDIT CARD?

19:43.918 --> 19:46.687
YOU KNOW, I FORGOT MY WALLET,
BUT I HAVE CASH.

19:46.687 --> 19:48.522
WELL, WE GOT TO HAVE
I.D. AND A CREDIT CARD.

19:50.658 --> 19:54.161
HEY, UM,
IS THAT A GUEST BOOK?

19:54.161 --> 19:55.596
YEAH,
I MAKE EVERYONE SIGN IN.

19:55.596 --> 19:58.466
KEEP THE EXTRA.
YOU STILL GOT TO SIGN IN.

19:58.466 --> 20:00.334
DO YOU MIND
IF I TAKE A LOOK?

20:00.334 --> 20:01.335
SURE.
THANK YOU.

20:06.707 --> 20:08.909
THANKS.

20:21.422 --> 20:22.757
THANK YOU.

20:27.695 --> 20:30.865
SO, WHAT DO WE GOT?

20:30.865 --> 20:32.533
NOT A LOT.

20:32.533 --> 20:34.034
I CAN'T GET THE FILE

20:34.034 --> 20:35.703
FROM MULTINATIONAL BUILDERS CORP
EXCLUDED --

20:35.703 --> 20:37.538
WE'VE BEEN OVER THIS.
KARSTEN DOCTORED IT.

20:37.538 --> 20:39.373
WHAT IF
I CAN'T PROVE THAT?

20:39.373 --> 20:40.508
I HAVE FAITH IN YOU.

20:42.076 --> 20:44.078
JACK,
THE CASE FOR MURDER ONE

20:44.078 --> 20:47.081
IS LARGELY CIRCUMSTANTIAL,
BUT IT'S STRONG.

20:47.081 --> 20:51.018
PLUS KARSTEN STILL WIELDS A LOT
OF INFLUENCE IN THIS TOWN.

20:51.018 --> 20:53.854
YOU REALLY WANT TO
ROLL THE DICE AGAINST HIM?

20:53.854 --> 20:55.823
I'M NOT SURE
I HAVE MUCH CHOICE.

21:00.728 --> 21:03.397
YOU KNOW I'M NEVER GONNA ASK YOU
WHETHER OR NOT YOU'RE GUILTY.

21:03.397 --> 21:07.234
BUT I HAVE A PRETTY GOOD IDEA
THAT YOU DIDN'T SHOOT ANYONE,

21:07.234 --> 21:08.903
NOT EVEN IN SELF-DEFENSE.

21:08.903 --> 21:13.574
AND I CAN'T BEGIN TO SPECULATE
WHY KARSTEN IS PILING UP ON YOU

21:13.574 --> 21:17.178
AND WHY YOU'RE EVEN WILLING
TO TAKE THIS HIT.

21:17.178 --> 21:19.613
BUT I'M NOT GONNA
LET YOU HANG YOURSELF.

21:19.613 --> 21:22.383
SO HERE'S WHAT
WE'RE GONNA DO.

21:22.383 --> 21:24.718
RETRACT THE CONFESSION.

21:24.718 --> 21:27.555
ON WHAT GROUNDS?
IT WAS GIVEN UNDER DURESS.

21:27.555 --> 21:29.924
THERE WAS NO DURESS, VIOLET.
I'LL MAKE THE CASE.

21:29.924 --> 21:31.225
WE CAN REFUTE THE EVIDENCE

21:31.225 --> 21:33.294
OF YOUR EMBEZZLEMENT
OF KARSTEN'S FUNDS,

21:33.294 --> 21:35.796
YOUR ASSOCIATION
WITH THE CROOKED ACCOUNTANT...

21:35.796 --> 21:38.132
GOOD.
...WHILE SIMULTANEOUSLY
RE-INVESTIGATING...

21:38.132 --> 21:40.067
THE MROZEK MURDER,
COMING UP WITH A KILLER.

21:40.067 --> 21:43.103
A VIABLE THEORY
WITH A CONVICTABLE PERP.

21:43.103 --> 21:44.605
THAT WON'T WORK.

21:44.605 --> 21:46.273
LOOK, I KNOW
YOU'VE TRIED THIS ALREADY,

21:46.273 --> 21:49.043
BUT I HAVE A LOT MORE EXPERIENCE
WITH CRIMINAL LITIGATION.

21:49.043 --> 21:50.711
I HAVE MY WAYS.
STOP.

21:50.711 --> 21:52.379
YOU'VE DUG YOURSELF
A REAL HOLE HERE,

21:52.379 --> 21:53.447
BUT I'M GONNA GET YOU OUT.

21:53.447 --> 21:55.115
THE BEST WAY TO DO THAT

21:55.115 --> 21:56.617
IS TO SOLVE THIS CRIME
ONCE AND FOR ALL.

21:56.617 --> 21:59.720
I'M THE CLIENT HERE, OKAY?
YOU HAVE TO DO WHAT I WANT.

21:59.720 --> 22:02.456
STAY THE COURSE.
IT WAS SELF-DEFENSE.

22:02.456 --> 22:05.626
NOW GO AFTER THATCHER,
GO AFTER PHONY EVIDENCE.

22:05.626 --> 22:07.595
DON'T LET ME GET STUCK
WITH MURDER ONE.

22:07.595 --> 22:10.331
BUT DON'T RE-INVESTIGATE
THE MURDER?

22:10.331 --> 22:11.999
THE REAL KILLER
DOESN'T MATTER.

22:15.569 --> 22:17.404
IS THIS
ALL ABOUT KARSTEN?

22:17.404 --> 22:20.741
WHAT HAPPENED
BETWEEN YOU TWO?

22:20.741 --> 22:22.109
WE HAD A FALLING OUT.

22:26.247 --> 22:27.915
YOU'RE A STRANGE GUY,
JACK.

22:27.915 --> 22:29.583
NOT REALLY.

22:29.583 --> 22:32.720
IT'S JUST HARD SOMETIMES FOR
PEOPLE TO SEE HOW NORMAL I AM.

22:48.802 --> 22:50.638
ARE YOU HUNGRY?

22:50.638 --> 22:52.840
A-ARE YOU?

22:52.840 --> 22:55.509
YEAH,
IT'S JUST KIND OF CROWDED.

22:55.509 --> 22:58.545
MAY HAVE TO
WAIT A WHILE.

22:58.545 --> 23:00.714
I MEAN,
WE CAN GO IF YOU WANT.

23:00.714 --> 23:02.216
DO YOU WANT TO?

23:02.216 --> 23:04.451
YOUR CHOICE.

23:04.451 --> 23:06.654
YEAH, SURE.

23:06.654 --> 23:08.956
I MEAN, WE CAN GRAB SOMETHING
AT THE STATION.

23:08.956 --> 23:10.958
SURE. LET'S DO THAT.

23:10.958 --> 23:12.059
OKAY.

23:12.059 --> 23:15.562
EXCUSE ME.
YOUR TABLE'S READY.

23:18.499 --> 23:21.168
WE'LL CATCH THE LATER TRAIN?
YEAH.

23:27.007 --> 23:29.009
CAN I HELP YOU?

23:30.411 --> 23:33.514
YEAH. UM...

23:34.982 --> 23:38.152
DO YOU REMEMBER ME AND THIS MAN
HAVING DINNER HERE?

23:38.152 --> 23:39.987
I DON'T THINK SO.

23:39.987 --> 23:41.155
WHEN WAS THIS?

23:41.155 --> 23:44.258
ABOUT THREE MONTHS AGO.
SERIOUSLY?

23:44.258 --> 23:45.926
YEAH.

23:45.926 --> 23:46.994
OKAY, WELL, THANK YOU.

23:46.994 --> 23:50.030
SORRY.

24:01.342 --> 24:03.844
HEY. UM...

24:03.844 --> 24:07.014
HOW LONG DO YOU GUYS KEEP
SECURITY FOOTAGE?

24:07.014 --> 24:09.350
LET ME CHECK.
OKAY.

24:11.185 --> 24:14.521
<i> This is Drew Stafford.</i>
<i>Leave a message.</i>

24:14.521 --> 24:16.857
I'VE GOT
SOMETHING TO SHOW YOU.

24:16.857 --> 24:18.792
HEADING TO YOUR OFFICE.
I'LL BE THERE SOON.

24:29.703 --> 24:33.707
IF YOU KNOW WHERE TO LOOK,
THERE'S A REASON FOR EVERYTHING.

24:37.444 --> 24:39.146
YOU DROPPED YOUR SCARF.

24:39.146 --> 24:40.914
IT GETS COLD.

24:42.383 --> 24:46.220
I STARTED TO FEEL LIKE
I COULD IMAGINE MY LIFE

24:46.220 --> 24:49.890
NOT THE WAY IT IS, BUT --
THE WAY YOU DREAM IT.

24:51.792 --> 24:54.928
THIS...THIS IS FOR YOU.

24:54.928 --> 24:59.233
HAPPINESS IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR
AND WORTH CHANGING FOR.

25:01.268 --> 25:04.905
ALL WE CAN HAVE HOPE FOR
IS THAT WE ARE

25:04.905 --> 25:11.578
WHERE WE'RE MEANT TO BE,
WHICH I'M CERTAIN OF RIGHT NOW.

25:11.578 --> 25:14.515
WHATEVER COMES,
WHATEVER CHALLENGES,

25:14.515 --> 25:17.518
WE'LL FACE THEM TOGETHER.

25:17.518 --> 25:20.054
I PROMISE.

25:32.053 --> 25:35.756
THERE'S A REASON
FOR EVERYTHING.

25:35.756 --> 25:37.758
HAVE YOU SHOWN THIS
TO ANYONE?

25:37.758 --> 25:39.593
NOT YET.

25:39.593 --> 25:41.696
HOW DID YOU GET IT?

25:41.696 --> 25:44.532
I WENT BACK
TO DUNE ACRES.

25:44.532 --> 25:46.434
MADE ME REMEMBER THINGS --

25:46.434 --> 25:49.303
ABOUT HOW YOU THINK,
HOW YOU ALWAYS PLAN AHEAD.

25:49.303 --> 25:51.447
I KNOW
YOU WANT ME TO FOLLOW YOU

25:51.447 --> 25:54.450
WITHOUT
HAVING TO TELL ME WHY.

25:54.450 --> 25:56.419
I DIDN'T THINK I COULD.

25:58.054 --> 26:00.056
BUT I CAN.

26:00.056 --> 26:02.592
IF THAT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

26:02.592 --> 26:04.761
I WON'T USE IT.

26:04.761 --> 26:08.898
WHAT MADE YOU
DECIDE THAT?

26:08.898 --> 26:11.234
BECAUSE I TRUST YOU.

26:12.735 --> 26:14.103
TIME'S UP.

26:26.812 --> 26:28.985
I GOT YOU
A BIRTHDAY PRESENT.

26:28.985 --> 26:32.655
IT'S AT YOUR PLACE IN ONE
OF THE BOXES I LEFT THERE.

26:32.655 --> 26:35.024
IT'S WRAPPED IN STRIPED PAPER
WITH A BLUE BOW.

26:35.024 --> 26:36.693
I WANT YOU TO OPEN IT.

26:36.693 --> 26:38.261
OKAY.

26:38.261 --> 26:39.862
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND.

26:51.140 --> 26:52.575
HEY, VIC.

26:58.047 --> 27:00.049
ARE YOU OKAY?

27:06.923 --> 27:09.926
I UNDERSTAND
THAT YOU'RE UPSET,

27:09.926 --> 27:12.428
BUT, YOU KNOW, WE --
WE CAN TALK ABOUT THIS.

27:20.370 --> 27:22.538
DAD DIDN'T
KILL UNCLE LOU.

27:22.538 --> 27:25.875
I KNOW
IT'S HARD TO BELIEVE.

27:25.875 --> 27:27.510
NO.

27:29.512 --> 27:32.015
MOM.

27:32.015 --> 27:34.651
WHAT I'M SAYING IS
EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED,

27:34.651 --> 27:36.653
IT'S BECAUSE OF ME.

27:40.990 --> 27:42.158
HEY.

27:42.158 --> 27:46.029
WHATEVER YOUR DAD DID,
IT WAS HIS CHOICE, OKAY?

27:46.029 --> 27:48.364
IF HE HAS MADE MISTAKES,
IF HE DID SOMETHING BAD,

27:48.364 --> 27:50.266
IT IS NOT YOUR FAULT.
LISTEN TO ME!

27:57.206 --> 27:59.542
I'M TELLING YOU IT IS.

28:23.866 --> 28:27.537
I WAS THERE THAT NIGHT...
WHEN LOU DIED.

28:29.372 --> 28:34.877
I DROPPED T.J. OFF,
AND I PARKED THE CAR.

28:34.877 --> 28:37.647
WHEN I WENT TO FIND THEM,
THEY WERE ARGUING.

28:37.647 --> 28:39.482
IT'S NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS,
T.J.!

28:39.482 --> 28:41.551
NO, JUST EXPLAIN TO ME!
HEY! GET OUT OF MY WAY!

28:41.551 --> 28:43.219
NO! WHY WON'T YOU
EXPLAIN TO ME WHAT HAPPENED?!
GET OUT OF MY WAY!

28:43.219 --> 28:45.154
LET ME GO!
HEY!

29:02.171 --> 29:04.507
AND THEN LOU PULLED OUT A GUN.

29:04.507 --> 29:05.675
BACK!
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

29:05.675 --> 29:06.976
PUT IT DOWN, LOU.
BACK UP.

29:06.976 --> 29:08.778
T.J.
NO. PUT IT DOWN.

29:08.778 --> 29:10.646
BACK!
PUT IT DOWN!

29:10.646 --> 29:11.647
T.J., NO!
STOP! PLEASE!

29:11.647 --> 29:13.950
T.J. KNOCKED THE GUN
OUT OF HIS HAND.

29:13.950 --> 29:15.651
NO!
I PICKED IT UP.
IT ALL HAPPENED SO FAST.

29:15.651 --> 29:18.654
GIVE ME THE GUN!
GIVE ME THE DAMN GUN!

29:18.654 --> 29:20.456
NO!
GIVE ME THAT GUN!

29:23.793 --> 29:27.096
VIC! VIC!

29:27.096 --> 29:30.166
I'M SORRY.

29:30.166 --> 29:33.169
I'M SORRY.

29:33.169 --> 29:35.171
I DON'T KNOW
WHY I DID IT.

29:35.171 --> 29:37.707
I'M SORRY.
SHH.

30:18.152 --> 30:19.486
COME IN.

30:19.486 --> 30:22.823
WHERE IS HE?

30:22.823 --> 30:24.491
HE'S UPSTAIRS.

30:27.061 --> 30:28.896
I COULDN'T KEEP LYING
ANYMORE.

30:28.896 --> 30:32.333
I THINK IT'S TIME
TO TELL THE TRUTH.

30:32.333 --> 30:35.636
I THINK YOU'RE RIGHT.
NO, HE'S NOT.

30:35.636 --> 30:38.439
WE CAN'T TELL ANYONE
ABOUT THIS.

30:38.439 --> 30:40.107
WE HAVE TO KEEP THIS
BETWEEN US.

30:40.107 --> 30:42.743
JACK HAS A PLAN.
HE ALWAYS DOES.

30:42.743 --> 30:45.012
JACK IS LOST.
HE'S CONFUSED.

30:45.012 --> 30:46.680
I THINK THAT'S WHAT
THESE PAST FEW MONTHS

30:46.680 --> 30:47.915
HAVE BEEN ALL ABOUT.

30:47.915 --> 30:49.250
YEAH,
HE'S IN TROUBLE, T.J.

30:49.250 --> 30:50.618
I MEAN,
WE CAN'T JUST LEAVE HIM THERE.

30:50.618 --> 30:52.119
NO!

30:52.119 --> 30:54.755
JACK IS SMART.
HE KNOWS WHAT HE'S DOING.

30:54.755 --> 30:57.791
WE CAN'T GIVE IN.
WE HAVE TO STAY TOGETHER.

30:57.791 --> 30:59.393
THAT'S THE KARSTEN WAY.

31:12.940 --> 31:15.442
YOU SURE ARE
A CREATURE OF HABIT.

31:19.613 --> 31:21.782
THE MACALLAN'S
STILL WHERE IT USED TO BE.

31:21.782 --> 31:25.953
HELLO, VIOLET.

31:25.953 --> 31:27.354
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

31:27.354 --> 31:31.025
I'VE BEEN BUSY.
YOU'VE BEEN DISCREET...

31:31.025 --> 31:32.526
UNTIL RECENTLY.

31:32.526 --> 31:36.363
I HAVEN'T HAD
ANY NEED OF YOUR SERVICES,

31:36.363 --> 31:39.533
SO...DISCREET ENOUGH.

31:39.533 --> 31:43.037
YEAH, WELL,
YOU HAD JACK DEFEND T.J.

31:43.037 --> 31:44.705
ON THAT MURDER CHARGE.

31:44.705 --> 31:47.708
HOW DID THAT GO?
T.J.'s FREE.

31:47.708 --> 31:49.643
AND NOW WE KNOW
WHAT REALLY HAPPENED.

31:49.643 --> 31:51.345
YOU THINK?

31:51.345 --> 31:55.316
YOU ASK ME, YOU COULD HAVE USED
MY HELP ON THAT, THATCHER.

31:55.316 --> 31:57.918
MAYBE THEN YOU WOULDN'T HAVE TO
DEAL WITH ME NOW.

31:57.918 --> 32:01.355
AM I DEALING WITH YOU?

32:01.355 --> 32:04.658
YOU KNOW JACK'S BROUGHT ME ON
TO REPRESENT HIM.

32:04.658 --> 32:06.994
OF COURSE HE HAS.

32:06.994 --> 32:08.829
WHY SHOULDN'T HE
HAVE THE BEST?

32:10.898 --> 32:13.901
YOU REMEMBER IN '08

32:13.901 --> 32:16.904
WHEN I DEFENDED THE TWO OF YOU
IN THAT BRIBERY CASE?

32:16.904 --> 32:19.840
BACK IN THE HEADY DAYS
OF BLAGOJEVICH?

32:19.840 --> 32:21.775
WHO GOT
EXACTLY WHAT HE DESERVED.

32:21.775 --> 32:23.911
THE STATE
WENT AFTER JACK.

32:23.911 --> 32:27.514
THEY OFFERED YOU IMMUNITY
TO ROLL ON HIM.

32:27.514 --> 32:30.851
IT WAS A GOOD DEAL.

32:30.851 --> 32:32.720
BUT YOU
WOULDN'T TAKE IT.

32:32.720 --> 32:36.056
YOU WERE INSULTED
TO EVEN BE ASKED.

32:36.056 --> 32:38.726
DID YOU REALLY THINK
I'D TURN ON MY OWN SON?

32:38.726 --> 32:42.029
SO, WHAT'S CHANGED?

32:42.029 --> 32:46.300
WELL, FOR ONE THING,
HE KILLED MY BROTHER-IN-LAW.

32:46.300 --> 32:48.469
COME ON, NOW.

32:48.469 --> 32:50.604
WE BOTH KNOW
THAT'S NOT TRUE.

32:50.604 --> 32:53.707
BUT FOR SOME REASON, JACK HAS
PUT HIMSELF IN THE LINE OF FIRE,

32:53.707 --> 32:55.709
AND NOW
YOU WANT TO BURY HIM.

32:55.709 --> 32:56.977
WHY?

32:56.977 --> 33:00.414
VIOLET, I'M JUST
A LAW-ABIDING BUSINESSMAN

33:00.414 --> 33:03.283
COOPERATING IN A FELONY MURDER
INVESTIGATION.

33:03.283 --> 33:04.852
HOW COULD YOU
POSSIBLY THINK

33:04.852 --> 33:06.920
THERE WAS ANYTHING
EMOTIONAL ABOUT THAT?

33:06.920 --> 33:09.823
YOU'RE GONNA TESTIFY
AGAINST JACK?

33:09.823 --> 33:12.292
IF I HAVE TO.

33:12.292 --> 33:16.130
AND YOU'RE PREPARED
TO BE CROSS-EXAMINED BY ME?

33:16.130 --> 33:18.966
BECAUSE YOU KNOW, THATCHER,
THE PAST IS THE PAST,

33:18.966 --> 33:21.869
AND I'LL GO HARD AT YOU
REGARDLESS OF OUR RELATIONSHIP.

33:26.673 --> 33:28.509
IS THAT
SUPPOSED TO BE A THREAT?

33:28.509 --> 33:30.944
NO.

33:30.944 --> 33:33.113
IT'S JUST A SUGGESTION

33:33.113 --> 33:35.315
THAT YOU TAKE
YOUR FOOT OFF JACK'S NECK

33:35.315 --> 33:38.085
BEFORE SOMEONE KICKS YOU
IN THE BALLS.
AH.

33:38.085 --> 33:40.621
YEAH,
I GUESS THAT IS A THREAT.

34:10.050 --> 34:11.485
HEY.

34:11.485 --> 34:13.487
OLIVER'S ASLEEP.

34:13.487 --> 34:14.788
WELL, GOODNIGHT.

34:14.788 --> 34:17.191
OH.

34:17.191 --> 34:18.892
WHAT WERE YOU
CALLING ABOUT EARLIER?

34:18.892 --> 34:22.963
UM, I WAS WONDERING
WHAT WAS GOING ON WITH THE CASE.

34:22.963 --> 34:25.132
WELL, HIS LAWYER'S PUSHING
FOR SELF-DEFENSE,

34:25.132 --> 34:26.967
BUT WE'RE GOING
FOR MURDER ONE.

34:26.967 --> 34:29.970
WHAT? WHY?

34:29.970 --> 34:31.872
YOU KNOW
I CAN'T DISCUSS THAT.

34:31.872 --> 34:33.874
AND IF HE'S CONVICTED?

34:33.874 --> 34:37.211
20 TO 60 YEARS, PROBABLY,
BUT THERE'S SOME EXTRA CHARGES,

34:37.211 --> 34:39.913
SO HE'LL BE A PRETTY OLD GUY
BY THE TIME HE GETS OUT.

34:39.913 --> 34:43.083
BUT HE DIDN'T SHOOT HIM, DREW.
LET'S NOT START THAT AGAIN.

34:43.083 --> 34:45.853
HE DIDN'T.
I HAVE PROOF.

34:51.892 --> 34:56.230
IT'S DUNE ACRES,
TIME STAMPED 8:08 P.M.

34:56.230 --> 34:57.564
DREW,
I KNOW YOU DON'T WANT TO

34:57.564 --> 35:00.601
PUT AN INNOCENT MAN
BEHIND BARS.

35:00.601 --> 35:02.536
SO, HIS CONFESSION
WAS A LIE?

35:02.536 --> 35:04.304
YES.
WHY WOULD HE DO THAT?

35:06.006 --> 35:11.345
I DON'T KNOW WHAT OR WHO
TO BELIEVE ANYMORE.

35:11.345 --> 35:14.681
AND FRANKLY, I AM TIRED
OF FEELING THAT WAY.

35:14.681 --> 35:18.185
OKAY.
HE WAS WITH YOU.

35:18.185 --> 35:19.686
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

35:19.686 --> 35:23.457
HE HAS DONE A LOT
OF BAD THINGS IN HIS LIFE,

35:23.457 --> 35:25.125
AND IF THIS
ISN'T ONE OF THEM,

35:25.125 --> 35:27.461
WELL, AT LEAST
HE'S WHERE HE BELONGS.

35:27.461 --> 35:28.629
DREW!

35:28.629 --> 35:31.298
I HAVE A CONFESSION
FROM A GUY

35:31.298 --> 35:34.034
AND A PATTERN OF FACTS
TO SUPPORT IT!

35:34.034 --> 35:36.703
IF HE CONCOCTED IT, THEN HE'S
PROBABLY HIDING SOMETHING WORSE.

35:36.703 --> 35:39.239
THAT'S JUST NOT TRUE.
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT!

35:39.239 --> 35:42.309
I DO! I KNOW HIM!
YOU KNOW HIM?!

35:42.309 --> 35:44.478
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
EXPLAIN IT TO ME.

35:44.478 --> 35:46.713
TELL ME!
TELL ME, WHY WOULD HE LIE?!

35:46.713 --> 35:48.849
BECAUSE IT WAS HIS SON.

35:59.507 --> 36:01.823
SO, JACK'S COVERING FOR HIS SON.
THAT'S WHAT THIS IS ALL ABOUT?

36:01.823 --> 36:03.191
BUT HE'LL NEVER ADMIT
TO THAT.

36:03.191 --> 36:07.900
AND I SWORE NOT
TO SAY ANYTHING, BUT --
BUT WHAT?

36:07.900 --> 36:08.917
YOU'RE TRYING TO SAVE JACK

36:08.917 --> 36:10.252
BY APPEALING
TO MY SENSE OF JUSTICE.

36:10.252 --> 36:11.420
THAT'S A GOOD ONE.

36:11.420 --> 36:13.255
DO YOU REALLY
WANT TO SEND A MAN AWAY

36:13.255 --> 36:15.057
FOR PROTECTING
HIS CHILD?

36:15.057 --> 36:19.061
A CHILD WHO SHOT A MAN.

36:19.061 --> 36:20.962
AM I SUPPOSED
TO JUST LET THAT GO?

36:20.962 --> 36:23.065
IS YOUR MORAL COMPASS
THAT COMPROMISED

36:23.065 --> 36:26.735
THAT YOU REALLY THINK
THAT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO?

36:26.735 --> 36:28.403
LOOK,
BEFORE ANY OF THIS HAPPENED,

36:28.403 --> 36:31.006
YOU WANTED ONE THING --
TO GET KARSTEN.

36:31.006 --> 36:34.009
WHAT IF JACK AGREED
TO TURN AGAINST HIM?

36:34.009 --> 36:37.179
ARE YOU TRYING TO
MAKE SOME KIND OF DEAL?
WOULD YOU CONSIDER IT?

36:37.179 --> 36:39.881
IN EXCHANGE FOR KARSTEN?
WOULDN'T THAT MATTER MORE?

36:42.584 --> 36:45.087
NO. NOT ENOUGH.
WHY NOT?

36:45.087 --> 36:50.025
BECAUSE A MAN WAS MURDERED,
AND EVEN IF JACK DIDN'T DO IT,

36:50.025 --> 36:53.028
HE LIED REPEATEDLY,
AND THAT IS AGAINST THE LAW.

36:53.028 --> 36:55.363
HE IS TRYING TO
PERVERT THE JUSTICE SYSTEM.

36:55.363 --> 36:58.033
THIS IS A MAN
THAT WORKED HIS ENTIRE LIFE

36:58.033 --> 37:00.535
FOR A CRIMINAL ENTERPRISE.

37:00.535 --> 37:02.504
HE'S CHANGED.
REALLY?

37:02.504 --> 37:07.776
SO, HE'S...SOME SORT OF HERO
MARTYRING HIMSELF?

37:11.046 --> 37:14.216
WHAT YOU SIGNED UP FOR
WITH THIS MAN...

37:14.216 --> 37:16.885
YOU ARE IN
WAY OVER YOUR HEAD.

37:16.885 --> 37:19.221
HE IS A BAD GUY.

37:19.221 --> 37:21.890
WHY WOULD I
JUST LET HIM GO?

37:21.890 --> 37:23.992
I DON'T WANT
HIM AROUND YOU.

37:23.992 --> 37:27.596
I DON'T WANT HIM AROUND OLIVER.
IT IS NOT SAFE.

37:33.335 --> 37:34.836
OKAY.

37:42.511 --> 37:44.679
AH,
YOU'VE JOINED FORCES.

37:44.679 --> 37:46.014
THAT SHOULD
INCREASE EFFICIENCY.

37:46.014 --> 37:48.016
SIT DOWN AND SHUT UP.

37:48.016 --> 37:50.018
SEE, I WOULDN'T HAVE STARTED
LIKE THAT.

37:50.018 --> 37:52.587
I WOULD HAVE SAID,
"WE HAVE A PROPOSAL."

37:52.587 --> 37:54.322
YOU WANT ME
TO GIVE UP KARSTEN.

37:54.322 --> 37:55.590
WE WANT EVERYTHING --

37:55.590 --> 37:58.260
EVERY SINGLE THING NECESSARY
TO PUT KARSTEN AWAY.

37:58.260 --> 38:00.061
HE WALKS OUT
A FREE MAN --

38:00.061 --> 38:01.897
NO PLEA, NO CHARGES,
NO JAIL TIME.

38:01.897 --> 38:05.167
WE'LL LET HIM OUT
ON HIS OWN RECOGNIZANCE FOR NOW.

38:05.167 --> 38:07.736
WE'RE NOT DROPPING THE CASE.
THE CHARGES ARE STILL PENDING.

38:07.736 --> 38:10.605
THERE'S NO GUARANTEE
UNTIL WE SEE HOW IT GOES.

38:10.605 --> 38:12.274
WITHOUT A DEAL,
HE SAYS NOTHING.

38:12.274 --> 38:14.509
WITHOUT A DEAL,
HE GOES DOWN FOR LIFE.

38:22.551 --> 38:26.721
GIVE US A MINUTE TO WORK IT OUT,
JUST ME AND JACK.

38:26.721 --> 38:28.223
JACK, I WOULDN'T ADVISE --
NO, IT'S FINE.

38:37.465 --> 38:40.802
IS THIS THE PART
WHERE YOU TUNE ME UP?

38:40.802 --> 38:43.038
DON'T I WISH.

38:43.038 --> 38:47.375
WE'LL SAVE THAT FOR ANOTHER TIME
WHEN I'M NOT ON THE CLOCK.

38:47.375 --> 38:50.045
HERE'S
HOW THIS IS GONNA GO.

38:50.045 --> 38:53.215
YOU AND I ARE GONNA
COMB THROUGH KARSTEN'S HISTORY.

38:53.215 --> 38:55.584
AND IF IT PROCEEDS
AS IT SHOULD,

38:55.584 --> 38:58.453
YOU KILLED MROZEK
OUT OF SELF-DEFENSE,

38:58.453 --> 39:01.122
YOU DO MINIMUM TIME,
MAYBE EVEN TIME SERVED.

39:01.122 --> 39:06.628
BUT IF YOU LEAVE OUT
ONE THING, ANYTHING,

39:06.628 --> 39:08.797
IF KARSTEN FORGOT TO CHANGE
A BLOWN BULB ON A SCAFFOLDING

39:08.797 --> 39:10.799
AND YOU DON'T
TELL ME ABOUT IT --

39:10.799 --> 39:12.300
THEN YOU'RE COMING
AFTER ME.

39:12.300 --> 39:15.136
NO.

39:15.136 --> 39:17.205
I'LL GO AFTER YOUR SON.

39:41.363 --> 39:44.032
GLAD YOU'RE OUT.

39:46.401 --> 39:48.403
YOU TOLD DREW.

39:48.403 --> 39:50.739
I ASKED YOU NOT TO.
I KNOW, BUT --

39:50.739 --> 39:52.741
YOU TALK ABOUT TRUST
AND THEN YOU DO THAT?

39:52.741 --> 39:54.075
I WAS SCARED FOR YOU.

39:54.075 --> 39:56.244
RISK EXPOSING A SECRET
THAT I LET YOU IN ON --

39:56.244 --> 39:58.780
SOMETHING I'M DOING
TO PROTECT MY SON.

39:58.780 --> 40:01.283
YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M SORRY.

40:01.283 --> 40:02.784
BUT IN MY PLACE,

40:02.784 --> 40:05.053
I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE
DONE THE SAME THING.

40:10.158 --> 40:12.327
YOU SHOULD GO HOME.

40:12.327 --> 40:15.330
YOUR FAMILY NEEDS YOU
AND VIC NEEDS YOU.
YEAH.

40:15.330 --> 40:18.166
LOOK, I HAVE TO FIGURE OUT
WHAT TO DO FOR HIM

40:18.166 --> 40:20.602
TO...MAKE HIM BETTER.

40:22.337 --> 40:24.940
I GUESS
WE'LL TALK TOMORROW.

40:29.711 --> 40:31.212
I DON'T THINK SO,
JACK.

40:31.212 --> 40:33.882
WHAT ARE
YOU TALKING ABOUT?

40:33.882 --> 40:36.851
EVERYTHING THAT'S HAPPENED
IS OUR FAULT.

40:36.851 --> 40:38.853
WE'VE BEEN SO SELFISH.

40:38.853 --> 40:40.188
NO.
WE HAVE.

40:40.188 --> 40:43.191
WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW IS
BECAUSE OF THE LIFE I'VE LED --

40:43.191 --> 40:45.026
THE LIFE THAT
I'M TRYING TO BREAK OUT OF,

40:45.026 --> 40:47.696
THAT I<i> AM</i> BREAKING OUT OF
WITH YOU.

40:47.696 --> 40:50.532
I CAN'T IMAGINE LIVING
WITH THE KARSTENS

40:50.532 --> 40:52.400
AS PART OF MY LIFE
OR AS PART OF OLLIE'S LIFE.

40:52.400 --> 40:55.403
THEY WON'T BE.
THEY WILL.

40:55.403 --> 40:58.506
YOU'LL ALWAYS
BE TIED TO THEM.

40:58.506 --> 41:00.508
YOU'LL ALWAYS BE
ONE OF THEM.

41:02.777 --> 41:08.016
I LOVE YOU,
BUT I JUST CAN'T BE WITH YOU.
