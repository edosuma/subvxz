00:03.571 --> 00:05.106
(Whispering)
Good morning!

00:05.139 --> 00:07.108
Morning.
Breakfast in bed.

00:07.141 --> 00:09.043
(Gasp)
Wow! Breakfast?

00:09.077 --> 00:10.744
Oh, what is this?

00:10.778 --> 00:13.447
It's chocolate chips
on the pancakes!

00:13.481 --> 00:15.083
That's just too much!

00:15.116 --> 00:16.450
What do you call these?

00:16.484 --> 00:17.785
It's called
chocolate chip pancakes.

00:17.818 --> 00:20.254
No way.
Yes. And they're
the best.

00:20.288 --> 00:22.656
Wow.
See, I told you,

00:22.690 --> 00:24.358
sick leave can be great.

00:24.392 --> 00:25.926
Yeah. Can you pass
me the laptop?

00:25.959 --> 00:28.028
No, no, no. No work
today, honey. Okay?

00:28.062 --> 00:30.798
I don't want people
to think I can't
handle the stress.

00:30.831 --> 00:32.200
Well, you kind of can't.

00:32.233 --> 00:34.235
That's how you
ended up on sick leave

00:34.268 --> 00:36.404
in the first place, right?
Right.

00:36.437 --> 00:38.005
But we can't stay
in bed the whole day.

00:38.038 --> 00:40.040
I mean, we have a meeting
with the priest and...

00:40.074 --> 00:42.443
Yeah, but that's
not for a few hours.

00:42.476 --> 00:45.213
That's true,
so we have time.

00:45.246 --> 00:47.448
Yes.

00:47.481 --> 00:49.217
See? Sick leave
is the best.

00:49.250 --> 00:50.918
I haven't thought
of it that way.

00:50.951 --> 00:53.354
I'm getting paid
to have sex!

00:53.387 --> 00:55.989
Wait, that didn't
sound right.

00:56.023 --> 00:58.859
* We're not living in America

00:58.892 --> 01:02.396
* But we're not sorry

01:02.430 --> 01:04.198
* I knew there was something

01:04.232 --> 01:06.300
* That we never had

01:06.334 --> 01:09.237
* We don't worry

01:09.270 --> 01:12.540
* No, we're not
living in America *

01:12.573 --> 01:16.377
* But we're not sorry, no

01:16.410 --> 01:19.780
* We don't care
about the world today *

01:19.813 --> 01:22.550
* We're not sorry

01:22.583 --> 01:24.252
* For you

01:25.719 --> 01:29.857
* For my baby, baby,
baby, baby *

01:29.890 --> 01:30.891
* Aahh

01:33.194 --> 01:36.063
Mmm. Pass my computer.

01:36.096 --> 01:38.566
Honey, no work
today, okay?
(Frustrated sigh)

01:38.599 --> 01:40.534
We're just
going to spend...

01:40.568 --> 01:42.035
as much time
as we can in bed.

01:42.069 --> 01:43.937
Should we have sex
again or... ?
Yeah!

01:43.971 --> 01:45.873
Okay.
Okay, but first
I've got to just...

01:45.906 --> 01:47.775
need a few seconds to
recharge Little Brucie.

01:47.808 --> 01:49.377
Little... Little Brucie?
(Laughing)

01:49.410 --> 01:50.444
Yeah.

01:50.478 --> 01:52.913
You can name him Big Brucie.

01:52.946 --> 01:54.148
Thank you, honey.

01:54.182 --> 01:55.716
Ironically, you know?

01:55.749 --> 01:57.818
(Wheezing laugh)
That's not funny.

01:57.851 --> 02:00.421
But, I mean, maybe
we should look online

02:00.454 --> 02:03.291
for some
inspiration, then.

02:03.324 --> 02:05.326
Really?
Yeah. Why not?

02:05.359 --> 02:07.161
Okay. I didn't know
that you were...

02:09.397 --> 02:10.998
(Clearing throat)

02:11.031 --> 02:12.333
Oh! Oh, oh.

02:12.366 --> 02:13.701
I wasn't talking
about porn,

02:13.734 --> 02:15.803
but... but good to know.
No.

02:15.836 --> 02:18.506
I was more thinking
of Kama Sutra positions

02:18.539 --> 02:20.007
or something like that.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.575
Understood.

02:21.609 --> 02:24.378
Wait, did you have
that site bookmarked?

02:24.412 --> 02:28.216
Um... No, I... just...

02:28.249 --> 02:30.251
I mean, bookmarks
are just a way

02:30.284 --> 02:32.686
for you to find...
sites easier.

02:32.720 --> 02:35.223
I know what a bookmark is.
Okay, so why
are you asking?

02:35.256 --> 02:37.825
No, but you had
a porn site bookmarked.

02:37.858 --> 02:39.727
How often do
you watch porn?

02:39.760 --> 02:41.462
These... Average.

02:41.495 --> 02:43.130
Average?
Yeah. Not... Maybe...

02:43.163 --> 02:45.065
probably even way below
average, I would say.

02:45.098 --> 02:47.468
I'm just curious,
you know. It's...

02:47.501 --> 02:49.102
How often do
you watch porn?

02:49.136 --> 02:50.971
Uh, never.

02:51.004 --> 02:52.406
Okay well, I watch...

02:52.440 --> 02:54.308
a little bit
more than that.
(Laughing)

02:54.342 --> 02:56.577
But not much. It's...

02:56.610 --> 02:59.112
You know what?
Maybe we should get
out of bed actually.

02:59.146 --> 03:00.914
Yeah?
Yeah, you can't
spend the whole day

03:00.948 --> 03:02.583
(Laughing)
together in bed.

03:02.616 --> 03:05.052
That's kind of
silly to keep it...

03:05.085 --> 03:06.920
We should do something.

03:06.954 --> 03:09.790
You've been having
some alone time with
Little Brucie there?

03:09.823 --> 03:11.525
(Laughing)
Stop it.

03:11.559 --> 03:18.098
(Music)

03:18.131 --> 03:19.767
Oh, you...
(Stammering)

03:19.800 --> 03:21.635
That's my mug.

03:21.669 --> 03:23.671
This one?
Yeah.
No! This is my mug.

03:23.704 --> 03:25.239
I always drink
out of this mug.

03:25.273 --> 03:26.974
No, you always drink out
of it on the weekends,

03:27.007 --> 03:28.442
because I let you.

03:28.476 --> 03:30.043
Because it's
the best mug,

03:30.077 --> 03:31.645
and I give that
to my girlfriend.

03:31.679 --> 03:33.013
But on the weekdays,

03:33.046 --> 03:35.449
I usually drink out of it.

03:35.483 --> 03:39.253
I'd hate to interrupt
your... morning...

03:39.287 --> 03:42.290
masturbate-and-drink-coffee
routine.

03:42.323 --> 03:44.858
Here's your precious mug.
(Mug clacking on table)

03:44.892 --> 03:47.561
Seriously?
What?
You're going to get
upset over the mug?

03:47.595 --> 03:49.330
I'm sorry. That was me.

03:49.363 --> 03:51.465
I'm sorry.
(Sigh)

03:51.499 --> 03:53.334
We're getting married
soon, I mean...

03:53.367 --> 03:55.836
And we are, like, the best
couple I've ever seen.

03:55.869 --> 03:58.672
We are. Obviously we...
we think the same.

03:58.706 --> 04:00.408
About the big...

04:00.441 --> 04:02.910
like, the big stuff.
Yeah.

04:02.943 --> 04:05.245
Like what, which...
what big stuff?

04:05.279 --> 04:06.880
Like human rights.

04:06.914 --> 04:08.482
Human rights, yeah.
I'm into that.

04:08.516 --> 04:10.818
Yeah, and death penalty,
that's like...

04:10.851 --> 04:13.354
Death penalty too, we are...

04:13.387 --> 04:14.988
You are which way?

04:15.022 --> 04:17.391
Don't tell me you're
for the death penalty.

04:17.425 --> 04:19.827
Well, I don't want
to be the guy that...
(Imitating electrocution)

04:19.860 --> 04:21.895
You know, I don't
want to be the guy
that pulls that lever,

04:21.929 --> 04:24.432
but I have not problem
with somebody else doing it

04:24.465 --> 04:26.266
if that's, you know, it's...

04:26.300 --> 04:28.101
But that's...
it's medieval.

04:28.135 --> 04:29.670
It's... not civilized.

04:29.703 --> 04:31.372
Well, certain good things

04:31.405 --> 04:34.308
came out of the
medieval times too,
you have to admit.

04:34.342 --> 04:36.176
I mean, the wheel, I think...

04:36.209 --> 04:38.379
Are you anti-wheel also?

04:38.412 --> 04:40.948
I mean, some people
just deserve to die,
let's be honest. Okay?

04:40.981 --> 04:43.351
I think, if there was
a slow torture option

04:43.384 --> 04:45.819
that would be something
that I would check off.

04:45.853 --> 04:47.588
Oh my god, I can't be... !
I can't...

04:47.621 --> 04:49.657
This is not true.
Are you joking
with me right now?

04:49.690 --> 04:51.392
No!
No.

04:51.425 --> 04:52.926
Maybe we should... Do you
want to go back to bed?

04:56.797 --> 04:58.799
(In Swedish)

05:26.560 --> 05:28.562
(Ringing, buzzing)

05:33.000 --> 05:34.735
Hello?
Bruce?

05:34.768 --> 05:36.303
Hi, it's Aubrey.
Don't hang up.

05:36.336 --> 05:38.305
Oh my God, you changed numbers?

05:38.338 --> 05:40.140
Yeah, I had to
for legal reasons.

05:40.173 --> 05:43.544
Look, I wanted to apologize
for that whole

05:43.577 --> 05:46.614
trying-to-have-sex-
with-your-body-while-
you-were-sleeping thing.

05:46.647 --> 05:48.916
I know now that that was wrong

05:48.949 --> 05:51.251
because a lot of people
told me that was wrong

05:51.284 --> 05:54.087
and that I pretty much
molested you, um,

05:54.121 --> 05:56.189
which is illegal,
and I won't do that again.

05:56.223 --> 05:57.458
Okay, fine.

05:57.491 --> 05:58.826
And I also wanted you to know

05:58.859 --> 06:00.894
that I'm a totally
different person now.

06:00.928 --> 06:02.596
I'm in a great place.

06:02.630 --> 06:04.898
And, um, I'm not
creepy anymore!

06:04.932 --> 06:06.333
I'm normal. And, uh,

06:06.366 --> 06:07.968
it would just
mean a lot to me
(Sigh)

06:08.001 --> 06:09.903
if we could, you know,
sit down sometime

06:09.937 --> 06:13.340
so I could apologize...
(Sigh)

06:13.373 --> 06:15.242
on your face...
I mean to your face.

06:15.275 --> 06:17.878
Okay, whatever, the next
time we see each other
we can talk about it.

06:17.911 --> 06:19.780
Okay, great!
Because guess what?

06:19.813 --> 06:22.182
I'm here, now!

06:22.215 --> 06:23.584
Jag ar har!

06:23.617 --> 06:24.918
In Sverige!

06:24.952 --> 06:26.286
I've got to go. Bye.

06:27.921 --> 06:29.790
Who was that?
That was, um,

06:29.823 --> 06:31.759
just a celebrity.

06:31.792 --> 06:33.126
Hm!
Yeah.

06:33.160 --> 06:35.195
D-list celebrity.

06:35.228 --> 06:36.730
Just a potential client.

06:36.764 --> 06:38.432
Oh! So you have
to work today?

06:38.466 --> 06:40.267
No, today is our day.

06:40.300 --> 06:42.102
I've set aside the
whole day for us,

06:42.135 --> 06:44.371
it's just you
and I together.
Yay!

06:44.404 --> 06:46.840
Or you can go and see him,
if you want to.

06:46.874 --> 06:48.576
No. Won't that
ruin the day?

06:48.609 --> 06:51.078
No! I mean,
it's your job, so...

06:51.111 --> 06:52.846
I mean, I'll just go
quick and come back.

06:52.880 --> 06:55.048
Take your time, honey.
I'll be here, so...

06:55.082 --> 06:56.617
Okay.

06:56.650 --> 06:58.151
What are you
doing back there?

06:58.185 --> 07:00.020
Just changing.

07:00.053 --> 07:02.089
Come on, get that
look off your face.

07:02.122 --> 07:03.624
I mean, seriously, it's...

07:03.657 --> 07:05.759
it's not my masturbatorium
or anything.

07:05.793 --> 07:07.995
People have
bookmarks, okay?
It's just a bookmark.

07:08.028 --> 07:12.132
(Music)

07:12.165 --> 07:14.167
(Doorbell chiming)

07:57.578 --> 07:59.112
Hi, Bruce!
Hello.

07:59.146 --> 08:00.614
How are you?
I'm okay.

08:00.648 --> 08:03.016
Please have a seat.
I will not have a seat.

08:03.050 --> 08:04.752
Okay? You have
one minute.
Tick-tock.

08:04.785 --> 08:07.320
Okay. Bruce,
I've changed.

08:07.354 --> 08:08.756
Yeah?

08:08.789 --> 08:11.358
I'm no longer
a crazy person, I'm...

08:11.391 --> 08:15.262
normal and boring,
just like you.

08:15.295 --> 08:17.631
Plus I'm getting married.

08:17.665 --> 08:19.199
You are?
Yes.

08:19.232 --> 08:21.201
So am I!
Oh my God!

08:21.234 --> 08:23.136
We're getting married!
Oh, I mean, yeah.

08:23.170 --> 08:24.838
To other people.
That is so crazy.

08:24.872 --> 08:26.540
We're getting married!
We're getting married!
No...

08:26.574 --> 08:28.709
I just want to tell
everybody, we are
getting married!

08:28.742 --> 08:31.044
The two of us are
getting married!
We are not getting married!

08:31.078 --> 08:32.613
We are, but to
other people.

08:32.646 --> 08:34.181
So that...
Have you been
working out?

08:34.214 --> 08:36.183
Little bit, but that's...
Your biceps feel huge.

08:36.216 --> 08:38.051
Okay, but, I mean...
(Sigh)

08:38.085 --> 08:39.787
Why did you want me here?

08:39.820 --> 08:41.321
You wanted to
say something?
Yeah,

08:41.354 --> 08:44.391
I wanted to see you
because I need closure.

08:45.693 --> 08:47.360
Closure?
Yeah.

08:47.394 --> 08:49.496
There was nothing ever
open between us to close.

08:49.529 --> 08:51.364
Well, we slept together.

08:51.398 --> 08:52.966
No, we didn't.
Yes, we did.

08:53.000 --> 08:55.168
No, I mean, we were
in the same bed,
side by side, but...

08:55.202 --> 08:56.770
Yeah, we were
in the same bed

08:56.804 --> 08:58.438
and we were naked.
No.

08:58.471 --> 09:01.341
And some parts of
your body were in
some parts of my body.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.010
Okay, you know, I just...
We slept together.

09:03.043 --> 09:05.078
I mean, technically
we slept together.
Thank you.

09:05.112 --> 09:06.980
No, but that's...

09:07.014 --> 09:09.049
I've honestly been trying
to forget that night
ever since it happened.

09:09.082 --> 09:11.318
Well, I've been trying
to not think about it
every second.

09:11.351 --> 09:13.787
(Sigh)
Literally, every second.

09:13.821 --> 09:16.023
I can't be
obsessing over you

09:16.056 --> 09:17.891
if I'm about to
get married, so...

09:17.925 --> 09:19.492
we need to talk about it.

09:19.526 --> 09:21.261
Okay. Well, tell me
about your fiancé.

09:21.294 --> 09:22.830
Okay.

09:22.863 --> 09:25.465
He is...

09:25.498 --> 09:27.100
um...

09:27.134 --> 09:30.403
He's amazing.
He's so... tall

09:30.437 --> 09:33.707
and he looks really
good in bright colours

09:33.741 --> 09:35.342
and tiny bow ties.

09:35.375 --> 09:36.944
Did I mention he's tall?

09:36.977 --> 09:38.545
Yes.
He's nothing like you.

09:38.578 --> 09:40.280
He's like the anti-Bruce.

09:40.313 --> 09:42.282
You know what?
Enough, okay?

09:42.315 --> 09:43.884
What?
You don't have a fiancé,

09:43.917 --> 09:45.619
there's no such thing,
he's a non-existent fiancé.

09:45.653 --> 09:48.155
I have a fiancée
and I'm going to go
to her right now.

09:48.188 --> 09:49.857
I do have a fiancé.
He exists.

09:49.890 --> 09:51.558
No, he doesn't.
Yes, he does!
No, he doesn't!

09:51.591 --> 09:53.927
Oh my god, I can't believe
you're so jealous, Bruce!

09:53.961 --> 09:55.528
I expected more
of you, honestly.

09:55.562 --> 09:57.397
I expected the same
from you. Exact same.

09:57.430 --> 09:58.999
You'll meet him soon!

10:02.202 --> 10:03.603
What's your name?

10:12.145 --> 10:14.414
Hi, hello.

10:14.447 --> 10:15.916
Thank you for coming in,

10:15.949 --> 10:17.885
and let's get right to it.

10:17.918 --> 10:21.154
Uh, you will start
in a room in the back

10:21.188 --> 10:24.524
and the bells will
start ringing.

10:24.557 --> 10:27.094
And have you decided
what music you want
to come in to?

10:27.127 --> 10:29.830
Eh, sorry, maybe
we shouldn't get
into too much detail

10:29.863 --> 10:31.732
before the priest comes.
(Chuckle)

10:31.765 --> 10:33.600
Well, I am the priest.

10:33.633 --> 10:36.036
Right, you're the priest!

10:36.069 --> 10:38.005
And you're a woman.
Yes, I am.

10:38.038 --> 10:39.740
You're a woman priest.

10:39.773 --> 10:41.374
So that's...

10:41.408 --> 10:43.711
We don't have a
problem with that.
Right, honey? No.

10:43.744 --> 10:45.979
(Sigh)
I love women. Just...

10:46.013 --> 10:47.514
And I love priests, so...

10:47.547 --> 10:48.949
What's not to like?

10:48.982 --> 10:50.818
Yes, win-win.
(Forced laugh)

10:50.851 --> 10:52.319
(Exhaling)

10:56.724 --> 10:58.291
(Frustrated growl)

10:58.325 --> 11:00.861
Gustaf:

11:28.956 --> 11:30.657
Priest:
I begin by saying,

11:30.690 --> 11:32.926
"We are here in the
presence of God."

11:32.960 --> 11:34.394
Ah, amen.

11:34.427 --> 11:36.663
"And we ask that
God bless these two

11:36.696 --> 11:38.565
who are about
to get married."

11:38.598 --> 11:39.900
Amen to that.

11:39.933 --> 11:41.134
Okay, honey,
you don't need to...

11:42.870 --> 11:45.438
Bruce thinks
that you expect us
to be religious.

11:45.472 --> 11:47.540
Oh, but that's
fine, Bruce. Um...

11:47.574 --> 11:50.210
Actually, a lot of
the people I marry

11:50.243 --> 11:51.912
don't believe
in Him or Her.

11:51.945 --> 11:53.747
Wait, "Her"?
Who's the "Her"?

11:53.781 --> 11:56.316
God.

11:56.349 --> 11:58.451
God is a "Her", here?

11:58.485 --> 12:01.388
Okay, but where
I'm from, it's
just... usually...

12:01.421 --> 12:03.190
referred to as a "Him."
Maybe we should move on

12:03.223 --> 12:05.458
and talk about the
ceremony or...?

12:05.492 --> 12:07.394
Ceremony, yes.
Okay.

12:07.427 --> 12:09.096
Yes. I'm excited about this

12:09.129 --> 12:10.764
because I have put
together a wedding plan.

12:10.798 --> 12:12.332
Mm-hmm. Thank you.

12:12.365 --> 12:14.367
We have. I mean,
she looked at it once.

12:14.401 --> 12:17.771
Uh, and it just has
very traditional,
standard vows.

12:17.805 --> 12:19.840
Mm-hmm.
The usual.

12:19.873 --> 12:21.842
Okay, um, I'm
going to start

12:21.875 --> 12:23.911
by making some
adjustments to these.

12:23.944 --> 12:26.346
Um, I see that you
want Emma's father

12:26.379 --> 12:27.881
to walk her
down the aisle?

12:27.915 --> 12:29.616
We usually don't
do that here.

12:29.649 --> 12:31.985
I'm not sure you understand
what that means.

12:32.019 --> 12:34.421
It symbolizes that the
father owns the woman

12:34.454 --> 12:37.257
and is giving her
to the husband.

12:37.290 --> 12:39.626
Okay, I don't think
you understand what
it means to us,

12:39.659 --> 12:42.262
because we just
think it's nice and
we want to have it.

12:42.295 --> 12:44.264
Well, I actually
think she has a point.

12:44.297 --> 12:45.866
What? It's tradition.

12:45.899 --> 12:48.201
Emma is not property.
I know that!

12:48.235 --> 12:49.870
Okay? I'm not a caveman.

12:49.903 --> 12:52.205
I... You know...
(Awkward laugh)

12:52.239 --> 12:54.274
This was a mistake.
You seem very nice,

12:54.307 --> 12:55.876
but we're going to leave.

12:55.909 --> 12:57.978
So, come on, Emma.
(Sniffing)

12:58.011 --> 13:00.480
Forgot my jacket, and...

13:00.513 --> 13:02.082
Come on! Let's...

13:02.115 --> 13:03.450
Okay, I'll go.

13:03.483 --> 13:05.185
I've already committed
to leaving, so...

13:05.218 --> 13:07.554
(Muttering)
...unbelievable,
the girl's, like,

13:07.587 --> 13:09.522
"property"... I know
she's not property, right?

13:09.556 --> 13:12.225
Gustaf:
Introducing...

13:12.259 --> 13:16.997
DJ K.L.M.N.O.P!
Go, go, go!

13:18.665 --> 13:19.666
Okay.

13:38.685 --> 13:40.053
What took you so long?

13:40.087 --> 13:41.989
We were going
through all details.
(Huffing)

13:42.022 --> 13:44.091
She's amazing,
I really want her
to be our priest.

13:44.124 --> 13:45.525
Now all of a sudden
you're into priests?

13:45.558 --> 13:46.927
I thought you didn't
want a priest!

13:46.960 --> 13:48.795
Now I do.

13:48.828 --> 13:51.064
What about the
woman priest thing?
What about it?

13:51.098 --> 13:53.200
I don't know, I just...
I grew up Catholic, okay?

13:53.233 --> 13:55.735
There were no
woman priests.
So?

13:55.768 --> 13:58.338
So I don't know if it'll
even count in the US,

13:58.371 --> 14:00.440
if it will be legal
or valid there! What?
(Incredulous laugh)

14:00.473 --> 14:02.042
That's so dumb!

14:02.075 --> 14:03.610
You were really
embarrassing in there.

14:03.643 --> 14:05.678
I was embarrassing?
Yeah!
What about you?

14:05.712 --> 14:07.780
You didn't even
follow me out!
What?

14:07.814 --> 14:09.616
We're supposed to be
on the same team, okay?

14:09.649 --> 14:12.285
Even if I'm being
irrationally
angry and crazy,

14:12.319 --> 14:14.721
you have to be
on my side, okay?
That's what love is.

14:14.754 --> 14:17.257
Yeah, but sometimes
your side is ridiculous.

14:17.290 --> 14:18.858
Can't I just have
this one thing?

14:18.892 --> 14:20.527
Okay? God, I gave up
everything for you!

14:20.560 --> 14:23.363
I gave up my friends
and my family, my job,

14:23.396 --> 14:25.832
and my life, and now
I'm getting married in
a weird Swedish church

14:25.865 --> 14:27.667
where god is
a "she" and...

14:27.700 --> 14:29.669
I just want to have it
the way I want
to have it, okay?

14:29.702 --> 14:32.605
How many times do I have
to hear this, Bruce?

14:32.639 --> 14:34.341
For real?

14:34.374 --> 14:35.875
I mean, will we
ever be even?

14:35.909 --> 14:37.544
No! No. We'll
never be even.

14:37.577 --> 14:39.346
As long as I'm
living here, we'll
never be even.

14:39.379 --> 14:40.914
It'll always be
crappier for me.

14:40.948 --> 14:42.682
(Incredulous laugh)
That's so sweet.

14:42.715 --> 14:44.584
I'm sorry if I
make you suffer.

14:44.617 --> 14:46.086
You do make me suffer.

14:46.119 --> 14:47.587
This makes me
suffer, okay?

14:47.620 --> 14:50.023
And... Thank you
for hanging out
with me today...

14:50.057 --> 14:52.125
Oh, thank you too!
Yeah, it's been nice.

14:52.159 --> 14:54.527
You know what? I really
need some time away

14:54.561 --> 14:56.863
from our time together,
so I'm leaving now, okay?

14:56.896 --> 14:59.266
Me too. I'm leaving too,
so see you later.

14:59.299 --> 15:01.501
Okay, the... exit's
that way, so I'll
let you leave.

15:03.270 --> 15:04.804
It's my decision!

15:04.837 --> 15:11.211
(Music)

15:11.244 --> 15:14.247
(Sniffling)

15:37.437 --> 15:39.506
(Chuckle)

16:04.497 --> 16:06.499
(Laughter)

16:09.802 --> 16:11.804
(Snorting laugh)

16:15.408 --> 16:17.977
(Giggling)

16:18.011 --> 16:19.546
Bruce!

16:19.579 --> 16:21.081
Hey!

16:21.114 --> 16:22.649
Oh my God, what
are you doing here?

16:22.682 --> 16:24.717
I live here,
so I'm always here.

16:24.751 --> 16:26.886
So weird.
This is my fiancé.

16:26.919 --> 16:28.521
Wow!
Hello.

16:28.555 --> 16:29.989
Hi, I am...

16:30.023 --> 16:31.391
surprised.

16:31.424 --> 16:33.493
He didn't think
you existed.

16:33.526 --> 16:34.927
No?
No.
I told you,

16:34.961 --> 16:36.396
Yeah, I guess I was wrong.
silly.

16:36.429 --> 16:37.864
Yeah, you did tell me.

16:37.897 --> 16:40.133
And I'm happy that
you found someone.
That's great.

16:40.167 --> 16:41.568
Thanks!

16:43.370 --> 16:44.604
Hey, are you okay?

16:44.637 --> 16:46.273
(Sighing)
Yeah, it's just...
Emma and I,

16:46.306 --> 16:47.774
we just had this
really weird argument

16:47.807 --> 16:49.242
over stupid
little things,

16:49.276 --> 16:51.078
and now it's gotten
to be this huge thing,

16:51.111 --> 16:53.546
and it's a few days
before the wedding and...

16:53.580 --> 16:55.548
It's bad.
Ugh...

16:55.582 --> 16:57.784
I'm sorry.
That sucks.
(Cellphone message alert)

16:57.817 --> 16:59.319
Yeah, that's the
thing about us.

16:59.352 --> 17:00.853
We never argue.
Mmm.

17:00.887 --> 17:02.622
Ever. We're just...
(Kiss)

17:02.655 --> 17:04.791
Bruce? Hello?
Yeah.

17:04.824 --> 17:07.494
We just love
each other so much,
it's crazy.

17:13.366 --> 17:15.368
(Message alert)

17:25.778 --> 17:27.747
(Laughter)

17:27.780 --> 17:29.782
(Snorting laugh)

17:31.418 --> 17:33.086
Aubrey:
Bruce?

17:33.120 --> 17:34.687
Yeah. Do I know you
from somewhere?

17:34.721 --> 17:36.656
What's your name?
Uh, my name, it's, um...

17:36.689 --> 17:38.758
His name is... Brr-yce.

17:38.791 --> 17:40.860
Bryce?
Bryce.

17:40.893 --> 17:43.029
His name is Bryce.
He's from Texas.

17:43.062 --> 17:45.165
Hmm.
(Message alert)

17:45.198 --> 17:47.800
Well...
Yeah.

17:47.834 --> 17:49.836
You know,
once you find the one

17:49.869 --> 17:51.238
that you love,

17:51.271 --> 17:52.605
you've got to
hold on to them.

17:52.639 --> 17:56.008
Unless you, um,

17:56.042 --> 17:57.510
met them before,

17:57.544 --> 18:00.447
and then,
a little bit later,

18:00.480 --> 18:02.115
you see them again

18:02.149 --> 18:03.616
and you see that
they're happy
with someone else

18:03.650 --> 18:05.552
and that makes
you realize that
you really love them.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.887
Which happens a lot.
It does?

18:07.920 --> 18:09.789
Yeah. Could be
happening right now.

18:12.125 --> 18:14.361
Love is worth
fighting for.

18:14.394 --> 18:16.696
You should go after
your girlfriend, man.

18:16.729 --> 18:19.132
Yeah! See, that
makes sense.
(Message alert)

18:19.166 --> 18:21.401
No, it doesn't!
Yeah,
he's right.
No, it doesn't.

18:21.434 --> 18:22.969
It doesn't make sense
actually, at all,

18:23.002 --> 18:24.604
because, um,
if you're fighting

18:24.637 --> 18:26.339
you guys should
probably just
break up.

18:26.373 --> 18:27.940
...I think Bryce is right.

18:27.974 --> 18:29.776
You know, I mean when
I see you guys and
the happiness you have,

18:29.809 --> 18:31.344
that's what I want,
and that's what I have!

18:31.378 --> 18:32.779
I should go after her.

18:32.812 --> 18:34.914
No, but...
Thank you so much.
Awesome.

18:34.947 --> 18:37.016
Yes. You should
hang on to this guy,

18:37.049 --> 18:39.286
he's a keeper, okay?
Thanks buddy, later.
No...

18:39.319 --> 18:41.621
Good luck!
What the hell was that?

18:41.654 --> 18:43.523
What?
I thought you
were an actor!

18:43.556 --> 18:45.758
I told you not to talk!
I'm a waiter.

18:45.792 --> 18:48.295
Okay, well, in America
that's the same thing.

18:49.629 --> 18:51.063

21:07.500 --> 21:09.168
Promise to never
agree with me again.

21:09.201 --> 21:10.770
I will!
Okay.
I mean, I won't.

21:10.803 --> 21:13.072
Yeah...
I mean, we come from
totally different worlds

21:13.105 --> 21:14.807
but there's no one
I would rather be with

21:14.841 --> 21:16.576
and that should
count for something.

21:16.609 --> 21:18.411
I mean, this time apart
has been horrible!
How long has it been?

21:18.445 --> 21:19.879
Uh, three hours.

21:19.912 --> 21:21.314
Right, that's...
It felt like more.

21:21.348 --> 21:22.782
(Laugh)

21:24.617 --> 21:27.119
I like that we're
different, okay?

21:27.153 --> 21:29.356
Yes.
Let's be different
together.

21:29.389 --> 21:31.391
Forever.
Forever. Yes.
(Chuckles)

21:34.026 --> 21:36.295
You want to
go somewhere?

21:36.329 --> 21:38.164
And masturbate?
(Tongue clicking)

21:38.197 --> 21:40.099
(Laughing)
Come on... seriously?

21:40.132 --> 21:41.668
Am I never going to
hear the end of that?

21:41.701 --> 21:43.903
No!
(Sigh)

21:43.936 --> 21:46.138
Funny.
Sorry.
(Laugh)

22:16.002 --> 22:18.971
* We're not living in America
