AUTUMN DREAMS

00:19.778 --> 00:23.278
Subrip: Pix

00:47.515 --> 00:49.214
Guess who?

00:49.316 --> 00:51.250
I'm sorry, Mr. Hancock,
I'll have it ready by sundown.

01:03.297 --> 01:04.328
They'll see us!

01:04.432 --> 01:06.665
Stop!

01:06.767 --> 01:08.700
<i>Annie?</i>

01:08.803 --> 01:09.868
<i>Annie?</i>

01:12.807 --> 01:13.739
Hey, Ben.

01:13.841 --> 01:15.040
Hey, Joe.

01:15.142 --> 01:16.675
Did you feed the horses
this morning?

01:16.777 --> 01:18.343
No, no...

01:18.446 --> 01:19.478
<i>Annie?</i>

01:20.981 --> 01:22.081
Annie Hancock,
where are you?

01:22.183 --> 01:23.849
Right here.

01:23.951 --> 01:25.951
There's my little girl.

01:26.053 --> 01:27.920
I'm not really your little
girl anymore, dad.

01:28.022 --> 01:28.821
No, honey.

01:28.923 --> 01:30.989
You'll always be my little girl.

01:31.092 --> 01:31.890
You found her.

01:31.992 --> 01:32.958
Yeah.

01:33.060 --> 01:34.293
Where are the boys?

01:34.395 --> 01:35.294
Joe?

01:35.396 --> 01:36.395
Ben?

01:39.033 --> 01:41.867
I just want to let you know
that we made the harvest quota.

01:41.969 --> 01:44.203
Just barely, but barely
is good enough.

01:44.305 --> 01:45.003
Thank you, boys.

01:45.106 --> 01:45.671
Good work.

01:45.773 --> 01:46.538
Thanks.

01:46.640 --> 01:47.739
Annie, you better
go get cleaned up.

01:47.842 --> 01:49.274
You don't want to be late
for the dance.

01:49.376 --> 01:50.109
See you later, guys.

01:50.211 --> 01:51.443
See you there, boys.

02:00.521 --> 02:02.321
I love this song.

02:05.860 --> 02:06.892
You're not changing your mind?

02:06.994 --> 02:07.860
No.

02:07.962 --> 02:10.795
I just don't want to hurt
my parents.

02:17.171 --> 02:19.938
Annie, we have to leave now.

02:20.040 --> 02:21.440
Ok, I'll see you outside.

02:21.542 --> 02:23.475
Okay.

02:28.249 --> 02:32.317
Joe, I need you to do me
a favour.

02:32.453 --> 02:33.352
Yeah, of course.

02:33.454 --> 02:34.720
Anything.

02:38.292 --> 02:42.928
I need you to give this
to my dad in 30 minutes.

02:56.210 --> 02:58.110
I can't believe this.

02:58.212 --> 03:01.346
I'm having a Cinderella moment.

03:08.856 --> 03:13.058
Annie, with this ring
I thee wed.

03:17.431 --> 03:25.070
Ben, with this ring
I thee wed.

03:25.172 --> 03:28.307
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

03:28.409 --> 03:30.142
You may kiss the bride.

03:30.244 --> 03:32.144
Nobody waits for that anymore.

03:35.049 --> 03:37.082
Congratulations.

03:41.288 --> 03:42.221
Thank you.

03:49.330 --> 03:50.329
I'm sorry, I truly am,

03:50.431 --> 03:51.630
but you two are just too young
to get married.

03:51.732 --> 03:53.298
Dad, you don't understand.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.701
You're only 18, Annie.

03:55.803 --> 03:57.469
Your mother will be so upset.

03:57.571 --> 03:59.204
What about your plans?

03:59.306 --> 04:00.872
You haven't even
started college.

04:00.975 --> 04:04.109
But dad, my future is with Ben.

04:04.211 --> 04:06.245
Look, it's not too late,
we can get it annulled.

04:06.347 --> 04:08.146
Sir, I have a job lined up
in New York.

04:08.249 --> 04:10.882
It's a big opportunity for me.

04:10.985 --> 04:11.817
For us.

04:11.919 --> 04:14.653
And they want me there
in two days.

04:14.755 --> 04:15.787
I want to go with him.

04:15.889 --> 04:17.389
I love him.

04:17.491 --> 04:18.923
I love your daughter
very much, sir.

04:19.026 --> 04:22.828
Well then I know you'll want
what's best for her.

04:22.930 --> 04:25.430
Deep down you know I'm right.

04:25.532 --> 04:26.398
Come on, Annie.

04:26.500 --> 04:28.100
Get your things.

04:29.003 --> 04:30.035
Ben...

04:31.739 --> 04:33.338
I understand.

04:42.583 --> 04:45.284
Maybe you two just need a
little time to think it through.

04:45.386 --> 04:46.118
Think more clearly.

04:46.220 --> 04:48.420
See the sense in this.

04:48.522 --> 04:49.955
I'll send your pay along
with the annulment papers.

04:50.057 --> 04:50.956
Mr. Hancock...

04:51.058 --> 04:52.658
You're a decent kid.

04:52.760 --> 04:55.160
I always liked you, Ben.

04:55.262 --> 04:56.528
I hope I wasn't wrong
about you.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.730
You're not wrong about me,
sir.

04:58.832 --> 05:01.033
One day I hope to prove that
to you.

05:32.066 --> 05:33.065
Annie!

05:33.167 --> 05:34.166
Joe, what is it?

05:34.268 --> 05:35.000
You did it again.

05:35.102 --> 05:36.234
What?

05:38.405 --> 05:39.438
Oops.

05:39.540 --> 05:40.172
I'm sorry.

05:40.274 --> 05:41.340
I'm sorry!

05:41.442 --> 05:43.442
It just feels so weird wearing
something so pretty

05:43.544 --> 05:46.111
when I'm up to my elbows
in farming all day.

05:46.213 --> 05:48.814
Look, it matters to me.

05:48.916 --> 05:50.182
Ok.

05:50.284 --> 05:52.617
I'll make you a deal, ok?

05:52.720 --> 05:56.054
I won't worry about the ring
if we set a date.

05:56.156 --> 05:57.456
We will.

05:57.558 --> 05:58.523
We will, I promise!

05:58.625 --> 06:00.192
It's just, I have so much
work to do

06:00.294 --> 06:02.928
if I'm gonna get that grant.

06:03.030 --> 06:04.896
How am I supposed to
revolutionize farming

06:04.998 --> 06:07.699
and look for a wedding dress
all at the same time?

06:07.801 --> 06:08.667
Wear coveralls.

06:08.769 --> 06:10.001
I don't care.

06:10.104 --> 06:12.270
Hey, we've been engaged
for nearly two years.

06:12.373 --> 06:14.740
Yeah, but I had graduate
school...

06:14.842 --> 06:17.008
And then planting
and the harvest

06:17.111 --> 06:18.877
and taking care
of your mother...

06:18.979 --> 06:20.379
there's always gonna
be something.

06:20.481 --> 06:25.083
Hey, we make a good team.

06:30.491 --> 06:32.791
Ok, let's do it.

06:32.893 --> 06:33.658
You mean it?

06:33.761 --> 06:34.893
Yeah, yeah!

06:34.995 --> 06:35.727
Alright!

06:37.598 --> 06:38.663
Alright, one
month from today,

06:38.766 --> 06:39.898
right after harvest.

06:40.000 --> 06:41.366
Ok.

06:41.468 --> 06:44.035
Fall is my favourite
time of year.

06:44.138 --> 06:45.937
<i>Annie.</i>

06:46.039 --> 06:47.205
<i>Hey.</i>

06:47.307 --> 06:48.039
This came for you.

06:49.476 --> 06:51.143
This could be about the grant.

06:52.880 --> 06:54.246
Fingers crossed.

06:58.285 --> 07:00.452
Good news?

07:00.554 --> 07:04.456
The foundation just wants
some more information

07:04.558 --> 07:07.459
about my study.

07:07.561 --> 07:09.861
Now don't you use this as an
excuse to postpone the wedding.

07:09.963 --> 07:11.830
You finally set a date?

07:11.932 --> 07:12.831
Right after the harvest.

07:12.933 --> 07:16.635
Congratulations.

07:16.737 --> 07:17.402
Thank you.

07:17.504 --> 07:19.137
Annie.

07:19.239 --> 07:21.373
Your father would have been
so proud.

07:21.475 --> 07:24.009
I know how much he wanted
to walk you down the aisle.

07:24.111 --> 07:26.011
I know, mom.

07:26.113 --> 07:28.246
I miss him every day.

07:30.684 --> 07:32.284
We've got a wedding
to plan.

07:34.788 --> 07:36.121
Yeah.

07:36.223 --> 07:38.457
Is everything ok?

07:38.559 --> 07:39.791
Yeah.

07:39.893 --> 07:42.060
Yeah, of course
everything's alright.

07:42.162 --> 07:43.662
She's just getting cold feet.

07:43.764 --> 07:45.497
No, I'm not.

07:45.599 --> 07:48.867
My feet are on fire.

07:48.936 --> 07:51.570
I just-I gotta run to the house
to grab something.

08:02.816 --> 08:04.883
A divorce?

08:04.985 --> 08:07.219
This can't be.

08:07.321 --> 08:09.721
The marriage was annulled.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.623
Anthony McAllister.

08:13.627 --> 08:14.626
McAllister.

08:21.034 --> 08:23.101
Hi, could I speak to
Anthony McAllister?

08:27.741 --> 08:29.074
Yeah.

08:29.176 --> 08:30.141
Ok.

08:30.244 --> 08:31.042
No, that's ok.

08:31.144 --> 08:32.344
I'll call back.

08:34.147 --> 08:36.780
This isn't happening.

08:36.884 --> 08:39.049
What's not happening?

08:39.152 --> 08:41.186
Where's Joe?

08:41.288 --> 08:41.820
He's out in the barn.

08:41.922 --> 08:42.687
Why?

08:42.789 --> 08:44.823
Come here.

08:44.925 --> 08:48.026
So dad filed those annulment
papers, didn't he?

08:48.128 --> 08:49.027
Of course he did.

08:49.129 --> 08:50.762
Well, look what I've got.

08:55.469 --> 08:56.601
Divorce?

08:56.670 --> 08:57.702
This doesn't make any sense.

08:57.804 --> 08:59.037
Yeah, I know.

08:59.139 --> 09:00.572
But those papers say I have to
appear in a New York City court

09:00.674 --> 09:05.577
with Ben the day after tomorrow
or I face contempt.

09:05.679 --> 09:08.013
Mom, what am I
gonna tell Joe?

09:08.115 --> 09:09.414
I mean, I never even had
a heart to tell him

09:09.516 --> 09:12.784
that Ben and I actually
got married.

09:12.886 --> 09:15.220
He's gonna be so upset.

09:15.289 --> 09:19.925
Maybe you've been asked to take
a meeting with the foundation.

09:20.027 --> 09:25.130
I'm sure it's just a
paperwork glitch and...

09:25.232 --> 09:28.500
Well, I've gotta go and make
a reservation.

09:28.602 --> 09:31.803
Well, at least you get
to see New York City.

09:45.686 --> 09:46.284
<i>Here you go.</i>

09:46.386 --> 09:47.686
<i>Thank you.</i>

09:56.430 --> 09:58.997
Well, we're not in Iowa anymore.

10:03.670 --> 10:07.005
Excuse me.

10:07.107 --> 10:09.107
Our wedding is finally
coming together,

10:09.209 --> 10:11.042
and let me tell you
it hasn't been easy.

10:11.144 --> 10:12.611
I was appalled by
the flower choices

10:12.713 --> 10:14.346
that Francois designed
for me.

10:14.448 --> 10:16.648
I asked for chartreuse
and he gave me lime green.

10:16.750 --> 10:18.917
And he was offended!

10:19.019 --> 10:22.721
On the flip side, you're going
to adore my new architect.

10:30.330 --> 10:32.430
Poor groom?

10:46.813 --> 10:50.515
Excuse me, I'm...

10:50.617 --> 10:53.284
I'm so sorry, I didn't
see you there.

10:53.387 --> 10:54.886
That's quite alright.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.755
Is there something
I can help you with?

10:56.857 --> 10:59.224
Yes, I'm looking for
Anthony McAllister.

10:59.326 --> 11:01.393
End of the hall, left,
first right.

11:01.495 --> 11:03.194
Thank you.

11:18.078 --> 11:18.943
No need to break
the door down,

11:19.046 --> 11:20.812
I don't think he's in there.

11:20.914 --> 11:22.080
Do you know
when he'll be back?

11:22.182 --> 11:24.015
No idea.

11:26.787 --> 11:30.321
Annie?

11:30.424 --> 11:32.190
Ben?

11:35.629 --> 11:38.763
I don't know what to say.

11:38.865 --> 11:41.266
How about "hello"?

11:41.368 --> 11:42.200
Yeah, yeah.

11:42.302 --> 11:43.301
Hello.

11:43.403 --> 11:45.904
Hi.

11:46.006 --> 11:49.174
You look great.

11:49.276 --> 11:50.809
Yeah, you too.

11:50.911 --> 11:52.343
Thanks.

11:52.446 --> 11:53.111
So...

11:53.213 --> 11:55.180
I'm looking for your lawyer.

11:55.282 --> 11:56.414
Do you work here?

11:56.516 --> 12:00.318
Yeah, I do.

12:00.420 --> 12:01.720
Well, I...

12:01.822 --> 12:03.488
I really need to find out
what's going on here.

12:03.590 --> 12:05.623
Yeah, why don't we go
over here.

12:05.726 --> 12:08.093
We can talk and I'll try to get
a hold of Tony.

12:08.195 --> 12:08.760
Ok.

12:08.862 --> 12:09.294
Give me this.

12:09.396 --> 12:10.762
Thanks.

12:16.636 --> 12:18.169
Your boss has a great office.

12:18.271 --> 12:21.372
He'll be very pleased
to hear you say that.

12:21.475 --> 12:22.741
Do you like him?

12:22.843 --> 12:24.476
He has his good days
and bad days.

12:24.578 --> 12:27.545
I think he's liking this one.

12:27.647 --> 12:29.013
Voice mail.

12:29.116 --> 12:29.781
Tony, it's Ben.

12:29.883 --> 12:31.983
Call me asap.

12:32.085 --> 12:33.151
So I don't understand
what's going on.

12:33.253 --> 12:36.354
We have to get a divorce?

12:36.456 --> 12:38.923
It's kinda hard to do
when you're not married.

12:39.025 --> 12:40.692
Did you not get the note?

12:40.794 --> 12:41.760
No note,

12:41.862 --> 12:44.796
just those very intimidating
legal documents.

12:44.898 --> 12:47.465
I told Tony to include the note
with the documents.

12:47.567 --> 12:48.733
Let me explain.

12:48.835 --> 12:50.435
Excuse me, Mr. Lawson.

12:50.537 --> 12:52.337
You have to leave now
for that appointment.

12:52.439 --> 12:53.338
I'll be right there, Tracy.

12:53.440 --> 12:55.840
Thank you.

12:55.942 --> 12:58.676
This is your office?

13:00.247 --> 13:02.380
Not bad for a farm hand,

13:02.482 --> 13:04.048
Sure beats the barn.

13:04.151 --> 13:05.049
Hey!

13:05.152 --> 13:06.417
I got your message,
I was on my way in.

13:06.520 --> 13:09.487
Tony, this is Annie.

13:09.589 --> 13:10.255
Nice to meet you.

13:10.357 --> 13:10.922
We gotta go.

13:11.024 --> 13:11.856
We're expected.

13:11.958 --> 13:12.724
I'll update you on the way.

13:12.793 --> 13:13.691
Let's go.

13:13.794 --> 13:14.726
Annie, sorry, this won't take
very long.

13:14.828 --> 13:16.528
Where are you staying?

13:16.630 --> 13:18.096
I just came
from the airport.

13:18.198 --> 13:18.663
Ok.

13:18.765 --> 13:19.898
Tracy?

13:20.000 --> 13:21.166
Tracy?

13:21.268 --> 13:22.734
Can you please set Miss Hancock
up at the corporate suite

13:22.836 --> 13:24.536
and have Hector take her?

13:24.638 --> 13:25.670
Thank you.

13:25.772 --> 13:26.905
That's ok, I'm fine.

13:27.007 --> 13:28.573
Annie, I insist.

13:28.675 --> 13:29.841
Wait a second.

13:29.943 --> 13:31.075
You're the Annie?

13:31.178 --> 13:32.377
Annabelle Hancock?

13:32.479 --> 13:35.079
That's right.

13:36.116 --> 13:37.382
If we're complete
by the 26th,

13:37.484 --> 13:39.150
should be there in 10 minutes.

13:39.252 --> 13:40.218
No, it has to be done
by then.

13:40.320 --> 13:42.320
Forget the small print.

13:42.422 --> 13:43.721
Can you hold please?

13:43.824 --> 13:45.356
Hector.

13:45.458 --> 13:47.692
Hi. This is Miss Hancock.

13:47.794 --> 13:49.093
She's an old friend.

13:49.196 --> 13:50.862
Please take good care of her.

13:50.964 --> 13:52.597
My apologies, I have
to travel with Tony,

13:52.699 --> 13:54.899
we're about to finish a deal
but I promise when we're done

13:55.001 --> 13:57.001
we can talk.

13:57.070 --> 13:57.902
Would you mind following me?

13:58.004 --> 13:59.037
Yes sir.

14:00.640 --> 14:01.840
An hour and a half.

14:03.043 --> 14:04.943
He's a busy guy?

14:05.045 --> 14:07.011
Yes, miss.

14:07.113 --> 14:13.017
He enjoys this
larger-than-life life?

14:13.119 --> 14:15.587
I don't think he has the time.

14:18.358 --> 14:19.290
It's just you and me?

14:19.392 --> 14:21.059
That's right.

14:21.161 --> 14:23.228
Hector, I drive a tractor.

14:23.296 --> 14:25.363
I'm not really a limo
kind of gal.

14:25.465 --> 14:27.098
Mind if I ride up front
with you?

14:27.200 --> 14:28.666
It would be my pleasure.

14:28.768 --> 14:30.068
Ok.

14:31.938 --> 14:33.171
Thank you, sir.

14:33.273 --> 14:34.939
You're very welcome.

14:47.487 --> 14:48.820
What a day.

14:48.922 --> 14:51.189
Excuse me, we'll have
whatever she's having.

14:51.291 --> 14:55.159
Annie, thank you
for your patience.

14:55.262 --> 14:56.461
We are all yours.

14:56.563 --> 14:57.762
Great.

14:57.864 --> 14:59.330
Can one of you tell me what's
going on with this divorce?

14:59.432 --> 15:00.832
'Cause we're not married.

15:00.934 --> 15:03.434
The thing of it is I recently
found out that your marriage

15:03.536 --> 15:05.737
was never officially annulled.

15:05.839 --> 15:08.006
No paperwork
exists anywhere.

15:08.108 --> 15:09.741
I don't know how it happened,

15:09.843 --> 15:11.075
probably got lost in the mail.

15:11.177 --> 15:12.710
But it is a problem.

15:12.812 --> 15:15.880
It's a big problem, because
I'm getting married next month.

15:15.982 --> 15:17.148
Ok, great.

15:17.250 --> 15:19.951
So you both need to get this
resolved as soon as possible.

15:20.053 --> 15:21.452
Both of us?

15:21.554 --> 15:24.122
I'm getting married on Saturday.

15:24.224 --> 15:25.857
I thought you knew that.

15:25.959 --> 15:28.159
No. I didn't.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.495
Ok, well anyway,
that's why the court date.

15:30.597 --> 15:32.630
Technically, in the eyes
of the law,

15:32.732 --> 15:34.899
you two are husband and wife.

15:35.001 --> 15:38.736
This is not good.

15:38.838 --> 15:41.072
Ok, well surely when
the judge hears our story

15:41.174 --> 15:44.509
he'll grant a divorce and
that will be that, right?

15:44.611 --> 15:45.376
Right.

15:45.478 --> 15:46.411
Because Joe's going
to be crushed

15:46.513 --> 15:48.079
if we can't get
married next month.

15:48.148 --> 15:50.848
You're... you're marrying Joe?

15:50.951 --> 15:52.917
My old buddy Joe?

15:53.019 --> 15:54.085
Yeah.

15:54.187 --> 15:55.920
He's the one.

15:56.022 --> 15:57.922
I always knew he had
a crush on you.

15:58.024 --> 15:59.924
The crush was mutual.

16:00.026 --> 16:02.393
I don't know what I would
have done without him.

16:03.997 --> 16:06.331
Normally when a divorce is filed
it takes quite a while

16:06.433 --> 16:08.566
to process and become official.

16:08.668 --> 16:12.136
I plan to expedite that by
arguing special circumstances,

16:12.238 --> 16:13.671
but it is crucial

16:13.773 --> 16:17.308
that you both show up
tomorrow morning to testify.

16:17.410 --> 16:18.376
Ok.

16:18.478 --> 16:19.944
Alright.

16:20.046 --> 16:22.647
Well, it's been a long day
and I know it's cliche

16:22.749 --> 16:25.783
but we farmers get up
with the roosters.

16:25.885 --> 16:28.286
Not a lot of roosters
in the Upper East Side.

16:28.388 --> 16:30.621
I'll have Hector take you
to the corporate suite.

16:30.724 --> 16:31.289
No, it's ok.

16:31.391 --> 16:32.256
I can get a hotel.

16:32.359 --> 16:33.424
Annie, please.

16:33.526 --> 16:35.493
It's the least I can do for
dragging you all the way

16:35.595 --> 16:38.796
to New York.

16:38.898 --> 16:41.466
I'm too tired to argue
with you.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.134
Thank you.

16:46.139 --> 16:47.338
It's ok, the car is just
right out here,

16:47.440 --> 16:49.574
I'm sure I can find it myself.

16:49.676 --> 16:52.610
Ok, well, see you
in the morning.

16:52.712 --> 16:54.178
Don't be late for court!

17:23.209 --> 17:24.175
Hello?

17:24.277 --> 17:25.309
<i>Hey, mom.</i>

17:25.412 --> 17:26.944
Annie, hi!

17:27.047 --> 17:28.746
Hey, sorry, I know
it's late there.

17:28.848 --> 17:29.881
Don't be silly.

17:29.983 --> 17:31.182
I've been dying to talk to you.

17:31.284 --> 17:32.050
How's New York?

17:32.152 --> 17:34.886
How's the little problem?

17:34.988 --> 17:38.122
It should be resolved
in court tomorrow.

17:38.224 --> 17:39.123
<i>Have you seen Ben?</i>

17:39.225 --> 17:41.726
<i>How was that?</i>

17:41.828 --> 17:45.363
Well, it was...

17:45.465 --> 17:48.733
it was strange and awkward.

17:48.835 --> 17:51.636
<i>He's a very successful
investor.</i>

17:51.738 --> 17:52.537
He's changed.

17:52.639 --> 17:57.008
Well, it's been such
a long time, hon.

17:57.110 --> 18:00.344
Considering where things
were left off and everything.

18:00.447 --> 18:02.046
Yeah.

18:02.148 --> 18:04.549
So how's
everything there?

18:04.651 --> 18:05.416
Yeah.

18:05.518 --> 18:06.717
Couldn't be better.

18:06.820 --> 18:10.521
Except I miss you.

18:10.623 --> 18:13.091
Alright mom, well...

18:13.193 --> 18:14.358
I got a big day tomorrow

18:14.461 --> 18:18.329
so I'll talk to you later, ok?

18:18.431 --> 18:19.130
Ok.

18:19.232 --> 18:20.398
I'll tell Joe you say hello.

18:20.500 --> 18:22.133
Yeah, ok.

18:22.235 --> 18:24.302
I love you. Bye.

18:37.383 --> 18:38.950
Hello?

18:39.052 --> 18:40.017
Yeah.

18:40.120 --> 18:41.152
Yeah, I'll be right down.

18:41.254 --> 18:42.854
Ok. Thanks.

18:54.434 --> 18:55.900
<i>Helloooooo!</i>

18:56.002 --> 18:57.135
Jovanna?

18:57.237 --> 18:58.469
Good morning, my love.

18:58.571 --> 19:02.540
I cannot wait to transform
this place.

19:02.642 --> 19:04.442
It's just not suitable
for entertaining.

19:04.544 --> 19:05.443
Can we do this later?

19:05.545 --> 19:07.712
I gotta get to the office.

19:07.814 --> 19:10.581
You don't want your bride moving
into something so ordinary.

19:10.683 --> 19:12.183
It's just not me.

19:12.285 --> 19:14.418
Us.

19:14.521 --> 19:16.254
Ours.

19:16.356 --> 19:17.622
Wait!

19:17.690 --> 19:19.657
I want you to see these plans
before I have them finalized.

19:19.759 --> 19:22.059
I only have a couple of minutes.

19:22.162 --> 19:24.095
That wall is going to come
out and everything

19:24.197 --> 19:27.798
will be all white with
touches of red and black.

19:27.901 --> 19:31.536
Clean, modern, bold.

19:31.638 --> 19:35.006
I thought we were going
with warmer colours.

19:35.108 --> 19:36.274
And if you knock down the wall,

19:36.376 --> 19:38.843
where are we gonna put my
grandmother's antique chest?

19:41.514 --> 19:43.548
We'll find the right spot
for it.

19:44.918 --> 19:45.950
You'll be amazed how much
room there is

19:46.052 --> 19:48.719
once we get rid of that piano.

19:48.821 --> 19:50.521
Wait, I thought that was
still up for negotiation?

19:50.623 --> 19:53.991
You told me you don't have time
to play it anymore.

19:54.093 --> 19:56.994
It contradicts my vision.

19:57.096 --> 19:58.663
You have to trust me.

19:58.765 --> 20:03.234
Interior design isn't just
my job, it's my calling.

20:03.336 --> 20:07.972
Let me turn our home
into a work of art.

20:08.074 --> 20:09.874
I want you to be happy.

20:09.976 --> 20:12.843
Whatever you need to make
that happen, go ahead.

20:12.946 --> 20:14.745
I have to go.

20:14.847 --> 20:16.280
I'll see you later for dinner?

20:16.382 --> 20:18.649
That new French place
on Madison.

20:18.751 --> 20:21.852
Maybe we could eat in sometime?

20:21.955 --> 20:23.988
Duck a l'orange, take out.

20:24.090 --> 20:24.889
Yeah.

20:24.991 --> 20:26.457
See ya.

20:32.131 --> 20:33.698
Thank you.

20:33.800 --> 20:35.967
Morning, Hector.

20:36.069 --> 20:37.134
I got you a little surprise.

20:37.237 --> 20:39.937
Why, thank you, Annie.

20:40.039 --> 20:41.505
May I call you Annie?

20:41.608 --> 20:43.741
What else would you call me?

20:43.843 --> 20:46.010
Thoughtful, considerate.

20:46.112 --> 20:47.645
That works.

20:54.554 --> 20:56.120
It's a very elegant apartment.

20:56.222 --> 20:58.990
It's a little cold
for my taste, but...

20:59.092 --> 21:01.659
I trust you slept well.

21:01.761 --> 21:03.327
I got up at dawn.

21:03.429 --> 21:03.995
I can't help it,
you know?

21:04.097 --> 21:05.930
It's just in my genes.

21:06.032 --> 21:08.933
Plus all the honking
and the sirens...

21:09.002 --> 21:12.837
we don't have a lot
of that in Iowa.

21:12.939 --> 21:15.406
I gotta be honest with you,
Hector.

21:15.508 --> 21:18.476
I didn't sleep a wink.

21:18.578 --> 21:23.281
I was pretty nervous
about today.

21:23.383 --> 21:25.816
May I ask you a question?

21:25.918 --> 21:28.252
Of course, ask away.

21:28.354 --> 21:31.055
How long have you worked
for Ben?

21:31.157 --> 21:34.258
Since he was a junior executive,

21:34.360 --> 21:35.960
and there was always
something special about him.

21:36.062 --> 21:39.764
He was polite, he was friendly,

21:39.866 --> 21:43.934
he was completely different
from the privileged young men

21:44.037 --> 21:46.737
who were his competition.

21:46.839 --> 21:49.473
He worked harder
than anyone else.

21:49.575 --> 21:53.778
It was like he was
chasing a dream.

21:53.880 --> 22:01.018
Looks like he finally
fulfilled that dream.

22:01.120 --> 22:03.321
I just wish he was happier.

22:20.206 --> 22:21.005
Are you alright?

22:21.107 --> 22:23.541
Yeah, just ready
to move forward.

22:23.643 --> 22:24.875
Ok.

22:27.180 --> 22:28.379
All rise.

22:31.384 --> 22:33.017
Mr. McAllister.

22:33.119 --> 22:35.086
Back in my courtroom
so soon?

22:35.188 --> 22:36.487
Yes, your honour.

22:36.589 --> 22:41.092
But I was told Judge Norton
was going to be presiding.

22:41.194 --> 22:42.493
He had an emergency.

22:42.595 --> 22:44.095
You're stuck with me.

22:44.197 --> 22:45.763
Well, this shouldn't take up
too much of your time.

22:45.865 --> 22:48.232
Let's hope not.

22:48.334 --> 22:50.334
Proceed.

22:50.436 --> 22:53.170
15 years ago, Benjamin Lawson
and Annabelle Hancock

22:53.272 --> 22:54.205
were married.

22:54.307 --> 22:57.074
That marriage was annulled
or so we thought.

22:57.176 --> 22:58.309
Why the confusion?

22:58.411 --> 22:59.710
The annulment papers
were sent in,

22:59.812 --> 23:02.880
but there's no record of
them ever being finalized.

23:02.982 --> 23:05.883
I discovered this fact
while writing his pre-nup.

23:05.985 --> 23:09.720
Mr. Lawson needs to be legally
divorced as soon as possible.

23:09.822 --> 23:11.789
He's getting married Saturday.

23:11.891 --> 23:13.057
This Saturday?

23:13.159 --> 23:13.958
Yes, your honour.

23:14.060 --> 23:15.693
So I'm citing special
circumstances

23:15.795 --> 23:19.663
and asking that you grant
them an immediate divorce.

23:19.766 --> 23:22.166
You realize what would happen
if I obliged every attorney

23:22.268 --> 23:24.368
with the same request?

23:26.906 --> 23:28.072
I need to hear
from the couple.

23:28.174 --> 23:31.108
How did this occur?

23:31.210 --> 23:33.711
Miss Hancock and I eloped

23:33.813 --> 23:36.013
but her father felt
we were too young.

23:36.115 --> 23:37.281
How young?

23:37.383 --> 23:40.718
Annie was 18,
I was 19.

23:40.820 --> 23:41.519
Both of legal age.

23:41.621 --> 23:42.586
Why did you agree?

23:42.688 --> 23:44.088
I didn't want the annulment.

23:44.190 --> 23:47.892
We were very much in love,

23:47.994 --> 23:50.394
but I did what I felt
was best for Annie

23:50.496 --> 23:53.798
and reluctantly signed
the papers.

23:53.900 --> 23:55.533
And then what?

23:55.635 --> 23:56.634
That's all I know.

23:56.736 --> 24:00.738
And then Mr. McAllister
discovered the problem.

24:00.840 --> 24:02.373
This was the last time
you two saw each other?

24:02.475 --> 24:04.809
We haven't spoken
in 15 years.

24:04.911 --> 24:07.812
Once I left Iowa she stopped
all communication.

24:07.914 --> 24:09.113
What?

24:09.215 --> 24:10.981
You're the one that got on
that bus and never looked back.

24:11.083 --> 24:12.817
Your honour, Mr. Lawson
is simply asking

24:12.919 --> 24:15.519
for the ability to get married
as scheduled on Saturday.

24:15.621 --> 24:17.521
I got the message loud and
clear when you didn't show up

24:17.623 --> 24:18.589
at the bus stop.

24:18.691 --> 24:20.458
Mr. McAllister, a little
order in the court.

24:20.560 --> 24:21.592
I'm sorry...

24:21.694 --> 24:23.060
I had a really good reason,
not that you cared.

24:23.162 --> 24:25.930
You never even bothered to
find out why I didn't show.

24:25.998 --> 24:27.898
I waited as long as I could.

24:28.000 --> 24:28.566
I wrote letters.

24:28.668 --> 24:30.234
I called.

24:30.336 --> 24:31.535
He never called.

24:31.637 --> 24:32.470
Why are you lying?

24:32.572 --> 24:34.004
I mean, none of this even
matters anymore.

24:34.106 --> 24:35.606
Your honour, I'm not lying.

24:35.708 --> 24:37.575
I just want to get
this over with.

24:37.677 --> 24:39.076
Annie, Annie, no...

24:39.178 --> 24:40.911
What is going on, counsellor?

24:41.013 --> 24:42.980
Ben! Ben!

24:43.082 --> 24:44.648
I'm going to review these
special circumstances

24:44.750 --> 24:45.916
and take them under advisement.

24:46.018 --> 24:48.652
You and your unruly clients
will be back in my courtroom

24:48.754 --> 24:50.554
Monday morning 10am.

24:50.656 --> 24:53.290
Your honour,
Monday is too late.

24:53.392 --> 24:54.692
This court is adjourned.

24:54.794 --> 24:55.793
Your honour!

24:55.895 --> 24:58.662
Mr. Lawson is going to be
married Saturday!

24:58.764 --> 25:00.164
That is not my problem.

25:00.266 --> 25:01.265
No, I realize that.

25:01.367 --> 25:04.268
It's-it's that would be
my problem.

25:04.370 --> 25:06.103
Ok.

25:11.077 --> 25:12.443
Annie.

25:15.615 --> 25:18.582
I got on that bus because
you never showed up.

25:18.684 --> 25:21.585
Not even to say goodbye.

25:21.687 --> 25:24.655
'Cause dad had a heart attack
that day.

25:24.757 --> 25:27.491
It was the first of many
and I couldn't leave him

25:27.593 --> 25:32.696
and I couldn't leave my mom.

25:36.068 --> 25:38.335
I am so sorry.

25:38.437 --> 25:40.838
I had no idea.

25:40.940 --> 25:45.209
He was just never the same
after that.

25:45.311 --> 25:54.885
This proud man suddenly
couldn't do much of anything.

25:54.987 --> 25:58.522
Why didn't you answer
my letters?

25:58.624 --> 26:00.925
Or return my calls?

26:01.027 --> 26:03.427
'Cause I never got any letters.

26:05.498 --> 26:07.898
You tried to contact me?

26:08.000 --> 26:10.234
You honestly had no idea?

26:14.807 --> 26:18.242
Dad.

26:18.344 --> 26:21.245
He was just trying
to protect you.

26:21.347 --> 26:23.714
He should have told me.

26:23.816 --> 26:26.250
Psst. Guys.

26:26.352 --> 26:27.685
What hap...

26:27.787 --> 26:28.385
What hap...

26:30.990 --> 26:32.690
Ben?

26:32.792 --> 26:33.591
Hi.

26:33.693 --> 26:36.026
What-what are you
doing here?

26:36.128 --> 26:38.762
I stopped by your office
after seeing the architect.

26:38.864 --> 26:39.897
Guess what?

26:39.999 --> 26:41.065
You weren't there.

26:41.167 --> 26:43.434
So I looked at your calendar
and it said "court".

26:43.536 --> 26:44.935
Nothing about a pretty girl.

26:45.037 --> 26:46.670
This isn't a pretty girl.

26:46.772 --> 26:47.938
I think she could pass
for pretty.

26:48.007 --> 26:48.706
No.

26:48.808 --> 26:50.107
Annie is my client.

26:50.209 --> 26:51.542
She and Ben are old friends.

26:51.644 --> 26:53.844
He asked me to help her out
of a jam.

26:53.946 --> 26:55.279
Am I missing something?

26:55.381 --> 26:56.013
A deposition.

26:56.115 --> 26:57.514
I'll take care of it later.

26:57.617 --> 26:59.016
We haven't been introduced.

26:59.118 --> 27:02.353
I'm Ben's fiancé,
Jovanna Jorgensen.

27:03.556 --> 27:05.322
Annie Hancock.

27:05.424 --> 27:07.391
We go way back.

27:07.493 --> 27:08.892
To Iowa.

27:08.995 --> 27:11.662
Our time on the farm together.

27:11.764 --> 27:13.297
It's Annie's first time
to the city.

27:13.399 --> 27:13.964
Yeah.

27:15.868 --> 27:17.001
How long will you be
in town?

27:17.103 --> 27:19.203
Our court date got postponed
until Monday.

27:19.305 --> 27:19.903
Monday?!

27:20.006 --> 27:21.338
Yes.

27:21.440 --> 27:24.375
Well, enjoy the big city.

27:24.477 --> 27:26.276
I will see you later,
my love?

27:28.047 --> 27:29.647
I'm having lunch with a client.

27:29.749 --> 27:31.882
Jovanna is an interior designer.

27:32.952 --> 27:34.385
Lovely to have met you.

27:34.487 --> 27:35.486
You too.

27:44.030 --> 27:45.029
We're getting married
on Saturday.

27:45.131 --> 27:46.330
Why can't we come back sooner?

27:46.432 --> 27:48.132
We have four days
to fix this.

27:48.234 --> 27:50.267
The judge's docket is full
and you two walking out

27:50.369 --> 27:52.670
of the courtroom didn't help
the case!

27:52.772 --> 27:54.238
So what are we gonna do?

27:54.340 --> 27:57.107
I got a plan.

27:57.209 --> 28:00.077
You'll get married as scheduled.

28:00.179 --> 28:02.112
Jovanna will sign a faux
marriage certificate,

28:02.214 --> 28:04.148
although you won't be
legally married

28:04.250 --> 28:07.384
until I get the judge to wave
her magic gavel on Monday,

28:07.486 --> 28:09.720
but I'll switch the papers, no
one will know the difference.

28:09.822 --> 28:10.854
I don't know, Tony.

28:10.956 --> 28:13.624
Ben, I'm going to shuffle
around some papers, ok?

28:13.726 --> 28:15.859
Jovanna shouldn't have
to cancel the fairytale wedding,

28:15.961 --> 28:19.163
it is the social event
of the season.

28:19.265 --> 28:21.231
What do you think, Annie?

28:21.333 --> 28:22.966
I think I need to get
back home.

28:23.069 --> 28:24.501
Ben, I have so much going on.

28:24.603 --> 28:26.603
You can't get married
until this is resolved.

28:26.706 --> 28:30.474
The judge insisted that
we all be present Monday.

28:30.576 --> 28:33.077
What difference does a few
days make, right?

28:37.349 --> 28:40.017
Ok.

28:40.086 --> 28:41.585
Alright, but I have to get
some work done

28:41.687 --> 28:44.154
because I'm doing a thesis
on the acidity of soil.

28:44.256 --> 28:46.323
That sounds exciting.

28:46.425 --> 28:49.593
You can have an office, a
computer, whatever you need.

28:49.695 --> 28:52.730
You can have an office and a
computer, whatever you need.

28:52.832 --> 28:53.897
Maybe a plant.

28:53.999 --> 28:55.199
You're at home.

28:55.301 --> 28:55.933
Let's go to lunch.

28:56.035 --> 28:57.334
I'm starving.

29:00.272 --> 29:01.238
Come on, Ben.

29:01.340 --> 29:03.574
According to our analyst
the whole sector is hot.

29:05.678 --> 29:06.443
Hi.

29:06.545 --> 29:07.311
Tracy said you wanted
to see me?

29:07.413 --> 29:08.512
Yes.

29:08.614 --> 29:11.548
We don't usually have an
in-house farmer down the hall.

29:11.650 --> 29:13.784
I want to buy King
Fertilizer Corp.

29:13.886 --> 29:16.687
We have to move fast because
it is poised for a big bump.

29:16.789 --> 29:19.723
I don't know anything
about stocks.

29:19.825 --> 29:21.825
But?

29:21.927 --> 29:24.928
I do know fertilizer, and that
brand is lacking in minerals

29:25.030 --> 29:27.664
and it just depletes
the soil over time.

29:27.767 --> 29:30.334
But our team has done reams
of research and...

29:30.436 --> 29:32.569
My degree is in agricultural
chemistry

29:32.671 --> 29:34.538
with an emphasis
on biotechnology.

29:34.640 --> 29:39.243
No disrespect, but I think that
King Fertilizer is a bad bet.

29:42.047 --> 29:42.980
Ok.

29:43.082 --> 29:45.215
It was your idea to ask her.

29:45.317 --> 29:45.916
Is that it?

29:46.018 --> 29:46.483
Yes.

29:46.585 --> 29:48.252
That's it, thanks.

29:50.990 --> 29:52.456
Funny.

29:52.558 --> 29:54.424
Real funny.

30:03.836 --> 30:05.135
Annie!

30:05.237 --> 30:06.737
Good call.

30:06.839 --> 30:08.672
King is down by $6.

30:08.774 --> 30:10.707
You saved us a lot of money.

30:10.810 --> 30:12.342
Yeah, it was my idea
to ask her.

30:12.444 --> 30:13.043
Great.

30:13.145 --> 30:14.044
Yes, it is.

30:14.146 --> 30:15.979
And because of that we owe
you a first class

30:16.081 --> 30:18.849
New York City dinner tonight,
I'm buying.

30:18.951 --> 30:20.184
That's not necessary.

30:20.286 --> 30:22.352
Jovanna and I already
have plans.

30:22.454 --> 30:23.754
Great, why don't we all go?

30:23.856 --> 30:24.521
Perfect.

30:24.623 --> 30:26.323
See you tonight.

30:30.629 --> 30:31.895
Congratulations.

30:31.997 --> 30:36.233
And it is lucky for me
you got that degree.

30:36.335 --> 30:36.767
Cheers.

30:36.869 --> 30:38.502
Cheers.

30:42.508 --> 30:44.141
What kind of degree?

30:44.243 --> 30:46.743
I'm a doctoral candidate.

30:46.846 --> 30:49.479
That's a lot of education
for running a farm.

30:49.582 --> 30:52.115
Well, running a farm
is hard work.

30:52.218 --> 30:56.520
Ben and I used to hear my dad
say that all the time.

30:59.191 --> 31:01.525
I have some good news.

31:01.627 --> 31:03.627
We have a final head count
for our wedding.

31:03.729 --> 31:06.430
Only 406.

31:06.532 --> 31:08.632
I thought you said 350.

31:08.734 --> 31:10.968
It's the social event of
the season.

31:11.070 --> 31:13.370
406 people?

31:13.472 --> 31:15.973
That's more than the whole
population of Granby.

31:16.075 --> 31:18.842
It'd be like Joe and me
inviting the whole town

31:18.944 --> 31:20.010
to our wedding.

31:20.112 --> 31:22.279
You're getting married?

31:22.381 --> 31:23.981
Didn't I tell you that?

31:24.083 --> 31:24.648
No, Ben.

31:24.750 --> 31:25.883
You left that part out.

31:25.985 --> 31:27.885
When's the wedding, Annie?

31:27.987 --> 31:30.954
It's like four weeks from today.

31:31.056 --> 31:33.323
I don't even have a dress.

31:33.425 --> 31:34.825
Seriously?

31:34.927 --> 31:36.460
I scoured every inch
of this city

31:36.562 --> 31:37.995
to find the perfect
wedding dress.

31:38.097 --> 31:40.264
I know just where to take you.

31:40.366 --> 31:42.466
Jovanna, I'm sure you have
enough on your plate

31:42.568 --> 31:43.901
with our wedding.

31:44.003 --> 31:46.737
I can spare a few hours
for your old friend.

31:46.839 --> 31:48.639
You can tell me all
about young Ben

31:48.741 --> 31:50.941
and his idyllic days
on the farm.

31:51.043 --> 31:54.144
No, I couldn't
possibly impose.

31:54.246 --> 31:56.446
Come by my office
tomorrow morning.

31:56.515 --> 31:57.547
I'll take you shopping.

31:57.650 --> 31:58.916
Just us girls.

31:59.018 --> 32:01.084
It'll be fun.

32:01.186 --> 32:03.020
Great.

32:18.370 --> 32:19.403
Hey, Joe.

32:19.505 --> 32:20.137
Hey, Annie.

32:20.239 --> 32:21.138
How are you doing?

32:21.240 --> 32:22.806
<i>I'm ok.</i>

32:22.908 --> 32:24.708
<i>How's everything there?</i>

32:24.810 --> 32:26.109
The tractor is running
a little sluggish

32:26.211 --> 32:29.980
but I'll have Ed
have a look at it.

32:30.082 --> 32:31.348
You know, your mom and I
sent out the save the date

32:31.450 --> 32:34.318
wedding invitations.

32:34.420 --> 32:35.319
That's great.

32:35.421 --> 32:37.321
When do you think
you'll be back?

32:37.423 --> 32:40.791
I should know a little bit
more on Monday.

32:40.893 --> 32:43.961
You know, it's not the same
around here without you.

32:44.063 --> 32:44.761
<i>Hey, your mom's here.</i>

32:44.863 --> 32:45.629
<i>I'll put you on speaker.</i>

32:45.731 --> 32:46.463
Ok.

32:46.565 --> 32:47.998
Annie, honey, we miss you.

32:48.100 --> 32:49.099
<i>Hey, mom.</i>

32:49.201 --> 32:50.734
Miss you, too.

32:50.836 --> 32:52.235
Listen guys, I gotta get going

32:52.338 --> 32:53.704
but I'll call you tomorrow, ok?

32:53.806 --> 32:55.572
Ok hon, good luck.

32:55.674 --> 32:57.007
Alright, bye.

33:00.179 --> 33:01.445
Bye.

33:08.320 --> 33:09.753
Tell Francois he's colour blind.

33:09.855 --> 33:12.089
The roses he showed me
are fuchsia.

33:12.191 --> 33:13.590
And I don't like the chairs
in the banquet hall.

33:13.692 --> 33:16.293
Tell Sergio to replace them.

33:16.395 --> 33:18.562
Yes, I do realize
it's 430 chairs

33:18.664 --> 33:20.697
and yes, by Saturday.

33:20.799 --> 33:21.965
Thank you.

33:32.011 --> 33:33.610
She needs something
much simpler.

33:33.712 --> 33:36.246
There's too much tulle.

33:36.348 --> 33:38.815
It's very pretty, though.

33:38.917 --> 33:40.984
You'll know when it's the one.

33:41.086 --> 33:42.786
Let's try the ivory A-line.

33:46.392 --> 33:47.557
Look, Jovanna,

33:47.659 --> 33:50.060
I really appreciate
your help with this

33:50.162 --> 33:53.764
but I'm just feeling a
little bit overwhelmed.

33:53.866 --> 33:56.266
Maybe I should look for
something back in Granby.

33:56.368 --> 33:57.868
Not on my watch.

33:57.970 --> 34:01.872
Iowa isn't exactly the fashion
capital of the world.

34:01.974 --> 34:05.375
You're not leaving New York City
without a wedding dress.

34:05.477 --> 34:09.980
Now you march right back
into that dressing room.

34:10.081 --> 34:11.348
You only get married once,
right?

34:11.449 --> 34:13.216
Right.

34:13.318 --> 34:14.583
Right.

34:16.255 --> 34:18.588
It all starts with the dress.

34:18.690 --> 34:19.922
It dictates the feeling,

34:20.025 --> 34:22.692
the theme of the entire wedding.

34:22.795 --> 34:24.828
I guess.

34:24.929 --> 34:26.963
So tell me all about the groom.

34:27.065 --> 34:30.233
How did you guys meet, how
long have you been together?

34:30.335 --> 34:32.969
Joe, he's...

34:33.072 --> 34:34.804
Joe is a solid guy,

34:34.907 --> 34:41.043
he's been our right hand at the
farm ever since, well, forever.

34:41.146 --> 34:43.547
It kinda feels like
we grew up together.

34:43.649 --> 34:45.982
I can't believe you run
a farm.

34:46.085 --> 34:48.351
After my dad died I had to.

34:48.454 --> 34:50.219
But I couldn't do it
without my mom and Joe.

34:50.289 --> 34:56.693
He's... He's
a really loyal guy.

34:56.795 --> 34:59.229
That's what I love most
about Ben.

34:59.331 --> 35:02.499
How honest and loyal he is.

35:02.601 --> 35:04.167
You know what I mean?

35:04.269 --> 35:06.803
Yep.

35:06.905 --> 35:08.572
How are you doing in there?

35:21.086 --> 35:22.085
No.

35:28.827 --> 35:30.260
No.

35:43.375 --> 35:45.108
That's the one!

35:47.412 --> 35:48.445
Once they make the adjustments

35:48.547 --> 35:50.714
we'll have it sent right over.

35:50.816 --> 35:54.151
Joe is a very lucky man.

35:54.253 --> 35:55.852
Thank you.

36:05.898 --> 36:07.697
I think Walker is playing us.

36:10.903 --> 36:11.434
Hello?

36:11.537 --> 36:13.637
Earth to Ben.

36:13.739 --> 36:14.604
Sorry.

36:14.706 --> 36:16.673
Walker.

36:16.775 --> 36:18.675
I was just thinking about
Jovanna and Annie.

36:18.777 --> 36:20.844
Wondering how things are going.

36:20.946 --> 36:22.479
That's why you're so distracted.

36:22.581 --> 36:25.248
Yeah, my future wife is helping
my other wife

36:25.350 --> 36:27.617
pick out a wedding gown so she
can get married to a guy

36:27.719 --> 36:30.587
who has no idea she was ever
married to me.

36:30.689 --> 36:33.256
What a tangled web
we weave.

36:33.358 --> 36:35.292
I'm counting on you to
un-weave it on Monday.

36:35.394 --> 36:36.159
What am I, new?

36:36.261 --> 36:36.893
I got it.

36:36.995 --> 36:39.196
Relax. It's going to be fun.

36:41.867 --> 36:43.200
Annie, hey.

36:43.302 --> 36:45.802
We were we were just
talking about you.

36:45.904 --> 36:48.471
How's the shopping
expedition going?

36:48.574 --> 36:50.740
I got a dress.

36:50.842 --> 36:52.108
<i>That's great.</i>

36:53.378 --> 36:55.946
Yeah, Jovanna was determined
to find the perfect one,

36:56.048 --> 36:58.949
and we did.

36:59.051 --> 37:00.917
So everything was ok?

37:01.019 --> 37:03.787
Yeah, Ben, she's great.

37:03.889 --> 37:06.523
I just feel badly about
deceiving her about you and me

37:06.625 --> 37:10.093
and Tony's whole faux
license scheme.

37:10.195 --> 37:13.063
I know what you mean, but
soon it'll all be resolved

37:13.165 --> 37:15.632
and there will be no
more secrets to keep.

37:15.734 --> 37:17.033
<i>Yeah.</i>

37:17.135 --> 37:19.736
She's really excited
about the wedding.

37:21.607 --> 37:22.772
Jovanna!

37:22.874 --> 37:23.807
Hello, my love.

37:23.909 --> 37:25.041
Do you mind if
I call you back?

37:25.143 --> 37:27.777
My fiancé just walked in.

37:27.879 --> 37:30.146
Yeah. Yeah.

37:39.958 --> 37:42.692
Fashionista farmer.

37:52.271 --> 37:54.704
I'll have to surprise
you more often.

37:54.806 --> 37:55.972
What brought that on?

37:56.074 --> 37:58.241
Can't a guy kiss
his bride to be?

38:01.179 --> 38:02.679
Later, lovebirds.

38:02.781 --> 38:04.581
I got work to do.

38:04.683 --> 38:07.417
Thank you for going
the extra mile with Annie.

38:07.519 --> 38:10.453
Just another wonderful thing
you do.

38:10.555 --> 38:11.888
How did it go?

38:11.990 --> 38:13.556
We found the perfect dress.

38:13.659 --> 38:16.259
And I learned a few things
about her, too.

38:18.230 --> 38:19.529
Like what?

38:19.631 --> 38:20.764
This and that.

38:20.866 --> 38:23.633
Just girl talk.

38:23.735 --> 38:25.802
But that's not why I came by.

38:25.904 --> 38:28.571
That remodel I did in Chicago
just snagged the cover

38:28.674 --> 38:31.241
of By Design magazine,
along with an eight-page spread!

38:31.343 --> 38:32.409
That's great!

38:32.511 --> 38:34.711
The only problem is it's not
absolutely perfect yet.

38:34.813 --> 38:36.813
You know how I am about details.

38:36.915 --> 38:39.149
So I'm on the next plane
to Chicago.

38:39.251 --> 38:41.418
I'll be back in time
for the rehearsal,

38:41.520 --> 38:43.553
I hope you don't mind.

38:43.655 --> 38:45.088
Of course not.

38:53.031 --> 38:54.397
Annie!

38:54.499 --> 38:56.032
What are you doing here?

38:56.134 --> 38:58.268
Ben was kind enough
to lend me an office

38:58.403 --> 38:59.769
so I can get some work done.

38:59.871 --> 39:00.503
Hey.

39:00.605 --> 39:01.438
Listen.

39:01.540 --> 39:02.772
I just, I really want
to say thank you

39:02.874 --> 39:04.808
for helping me find
that dress.

39:04.910 --> 39:07.010
I'm excited.

39:07.112 --> 39:08.878
It was my pleasure, honestly.

39:10.482 --> 39:11.047
Wait!

39:11.149 --> 39:13.249
I just had a great idea.

39:13.352 --> 39:14.884
Since you're stuck
here anyway,

39:14.986 --> 39:16.386
why don't you come
to the rehearsal?

39:16.488 --> 39:17.487
And the wedding?

39:17.589 --> 39:18.521
What?

39:18.623 --> 39:19.122
No...

39:19.224 --> 39:20.056
Nonsense.

39:20.158 --> 39:21.091
You and Ben are such
old friends,

39:21.193 --> 39:23.493
I know he'd want you there.

39:23.595 --> 39:26.329
I... don't know what to say.

39:26.431 --> 39:27.130
Say yes.

39:27.232 --> 39:28.131
I gotta run.

39:28.233 --> 39:30.900
See you at the rehearsal.

39:31.002 --> 39:32.402
Ok.

39:40.011 --> 39:40.643
Are you ok?

39:40.746 --> 39:43.012
I'm coming to your wedding.

39:43.115 --> 39:44.981
What did you say?

39:45.083 --> 39:46.750
Hey.

39:46.852 --> 39:48.651
You just missed
your shopping BFF.

39:48.754 --> 39:49.753
No, I didn't.

39:49.855 --> 39:50.987
I didn't miss her and
she didn't miss me.

39:51.089 --> 39:52.622
In fact, she insisted that
I come to the rehearsal

39:52.724 --> 39:54.057
and the wedding.

39:54.159 --> 39:55.458
You don't have to do that.

39:55.560 --> 39:58.461
But she's been so nice,
I couldn't refuse.

39:58.563 --> 40:03.066
You know, it's gonna be strange,
but I'll be fine.

40:03.168 --> 40:04.167
You're a real trooper.

40:04.269 --> 40:05.602
Piece of cake.

40:05.704 --> 40:06.736
Literally.

40:06.838 --> 40:10.306
Seven layers and counting.

40:10.409 --> 40:11.741
Maybe you shouldn't go
to the wedding.

40:11.843 --> 40:13.610
I'll be fine.

40:13.712 --> 40:15.245
Let me make it up to you.

40:15.347 --> 40:17.680
Jovanna has to go to Chicago

40:17.783 --> 40:20.316
so I'm off wedding duty for
a couple of days.

40:20.419 --> 40:23.787
How about after work I show
you some of my New York?

40:23.922 --> 40:24.888
Yeah, yeah.

40:24.990 --> 40:27.991
Take her out to dinner,
celebrate the divorce.

40:28.093 --> 40:29.526
You've barely seen the city.

40:29.628 --> 40:31.361
It's crazy to come to the
big apple and not take a bite.

40:31.463 --> 40:33.496
You may not get this
chance again.

40:37.469 --> 40:39.636
Ok.

40:39.738 --> 40:40.870
Ok.

40:47.846 --> 40:49.546
Hector, allow me.

40:52.017 --> 40:53.783
Let's do some touring,
shall we?

40:53.885 --> 40:55.585
As you wish.

41:06.765 --> 41:08.031
This is great.

41:15.474 --> 41:17.373
There's so many people here.

41:42.100 --> 41:43.566
You should have been
a tour guide.

41:43.668 --> 41:45.034
Well, we've only covered
Manhattan.

41:45.136 --> 41:47.136
We've got four more boroughs.

41:47.239 --> 41:49.639
I wish we had that kind of time.

41:49.741 --> 41:51.508
Me too.

41:53.011 --> 41:56.613
So how do you know
about this place?

41:56.715 --> 42:01.618
Well, when I first got here
it was pretty overwhelming

42:01.720 --> 42:05.755
so I'd find tiny, low-key
places like this

42:05.857 --> 42:08.758
so I wouldn't feel like such
a stranger.

42:08.860 --> 42:10.994
It looks like you fit in now.

42:11.096 --> 42:13.563
I'm just a country boy
in a designer suit.

42:13.665 --> 42:16.299
And a chauffeur
and over 400 people

42:16.401 --> 42:20.103
coming to your wedding!

42:20.205 --> 42:22.205
You know, why don't
we go uptown?

42:22.307 --> 42:23.306
I'll show you Fifth Avenue,

42:23.408 --> 42:27.010
and then we have
dinner reservations.

42:27.112 --> 42:29.979
Can I be honest with you?

42:30.081 --> 42:32.215
Fire away.

42:32.317 --> 42:35.985
I really appreciate you showing
me all the wonderful things

42:36.087 --> 42:40.657
that New York has to offer but
you don't have to impress me.

42:40.759 --> 42:43.660
I'm not trying to impress you.

42:43.762 --> 42:46.296
Well, maybe a little bit.

42:46.398 --> 42:48.665
But it's only because the life
I'm living right now

42:48.733 --> 42:52.902
is what I always dreamed of...

42:53.004 --> 42:54.837
for us.

42:59.544 --> 43:00.310
Ok, you tell me.

43:00.412 --> 43:04.247
Where do you want to go?

43:04.349 --> 43:08.451
How about somewhere
where I won't feel like a fool

43:08.553 --> 43:12.655
for using the wrong fork?

43:12.757 --> 43:14.791
I know a perfect spot.

43:14.893 --> 43:17.560
No forks required.

43:17.662 --> 43:18.595
Come on, let's go.

43:18.697 --> 43:20.563
Ok.

43:29.874 --> 43:30.607
Where to?

43:30.709 --> 43:34.410
Hector, let's go to Brooklyn.

43:34.512 --> 43:36.179
Yes, sir.

43:58.803 --> 44:01.037
I'm afraid we may be lost.

44:01.139 --> 44:02.839
We're not lost.

44:02.941 --> 44:05.008
I used to live around here.

44:05.110 --> 44:07.910
Fourth story walk-up,
no hot water.

44:08.013 --> 44:09.412
It was all I could afford.

44:09.514 --> 44:14.217
See now this is my favourite
part of the tour.

44:14.319 --> 44:16.519
I wanted to see your New York.

44:16.621 --> 44:18.821
Let's go check it out.

44:25.530 --> 44:26.963
Hector, why don't you
grab something to eat?

44:27.065 --> 44:28.531
I'll catch up with you later.

44:28.633 --> 44:30.800
As you wish.

44:33.371 --> 44:34.470
Walk with me?

44:34.572 --> 44:36.372
Sure.

44:38.510 --> 44:42.111
So this is the first place
that I landed after I arrived.

44:42.213 --> 44:42.612
Yeah?

44:42.714 --> 44:45.915
Yeah.

44:46.017 --> 44:48.351
I loved it.

44:48.453 --> 44:52.088
My landlady, Mrs. Pederson,
gave me a break on my rent,

44:52.190 --> 44:54.157
said she believed in me.

44:54.259 --> 44:55.491
Thought I had a future.

44:56.494 --> 45:00.196
How right she was?

45:00.298 --> 45:02.498
So how did you get you

45:02.600 --> 45:05.935
from a four story walk-up
to a penthouse?

45:06.037 --> 45:07.370
Luck.

45:07.472 --> 45:08.938
And a little bit of talent.

45:09.040 --> 45:12.008
Actually, it started
with your dad.

45:12.110 --> 45:16.079
He used to have trouble with
his books and I'd help him out.

45:16.181 --> 45:17.814
You helped my dad?

45:17.916 --> 45:19.749
I mean, he knew his stuff,

45:19.851 --> 45:21.984
he just wasn't great at putting
it on paper

45:22.087 --> 45:26.289
and bottom line thinking
came easy to me.

45:26.391 --> 45:32.295
So you... you get to New York,
and then what?

45:32.363 --> 45:35.498
I kinda became a gopher
for a Wall Street trader

45:35.600 --> 45:41.637
and he noticed I had a knack for
it and he became my mentor.

45:41.740 --> 45:42.405
I'm pretty lucky.

45:42.507 --> 45:43.639
I love what I do,

45:43.742 --> 45:51.514
but I work so much that
sometimes I forget to slow down.

45:51.616 --> 45:53.583
Still hungry?

45:53.685 --> 45:56.886
As long as it's nothing fancy.

45:56.988 --> 45:57.987
See for yourself.

45:59.257 --> 46:00.490
I love pizza.

46:00.592 --> 46:01.057
Yeah?

46:01.159 --> 46:02.058
Yeah.

46:02.160 --> 46:04.060
Can we get two cheese please?

46:04.162 --> 46:05.628
You just wait.

46:05.730 --> 46:06.929
It's the best?

46:07.031 --> 46:07.864
My absolute favourite.

46:07.966 --> 46:09.265
Your favourite?

46:09.367 --> 46:09.932
Ok.

46:10.034 --> 46:11.601
Hands down.

46:11.703 --> 46:12.368
Thank you.

46:12.470 --> 46:13.970
Thank you.

46:14.939 --> 46:15.571
There you go.

46:15.673 --> 46:17.039
Yum.

46:18.843 --> 46:21.344
So this is the best pizza
you will ever have.

46:21.446 --> 46:23.012
Really?

46:23.114 --> 46:23.646
I promise.

46:23.748 --> 46:24.781
Ok.

46:24.883 --> 46:26.949
Woah, woah, wait.

46:27.051 --> 46:28.618
This is how we do it
in Brooklyn.

46:28.720 --> 46:31.254
Ok, you gotta bend it.

46:31.322 --> 46:33.289
Alright.

46:36.361 --> 46:38.261
Yeah, that's good.

46:38.363 --> 46:39.629
That is good.

46:39.731 --> 46:40.296
Right?

46:40.398 --> 46:41.731
Mmmhmm.

46:41.833 --> 46:44.534
Yeah.

46:44.636 --> 46:46.369
You got a little...

46:46.471 --> 46:47.503
What?

46:50.942 --> 46:52.675
It's all over me,
isn't it?

46:52.777 --> 46:54.844
I mean, you know it's great
pizza when you start wearing it.

46:56.514 --> 47:00.383
And no forks required.

47:00.485 --> 47:03.452
So have you ever brought
Jovanna here?

47:03.555 --> 47:08.524
This isn't really her style.

47:18.336 --> 47:19.869
Are you kidding me?

47:19.971 --> 47:21.871
In the middle of Brooklyn?

47:23.908 --> 47:28.978
This is my favourite part
of town.

47:29.080 --> 47:30.913
You want a soda?

47:31.015 --> 47:32.248
Yeah, I would love a soda.

47:32.350 --> 47:34.717
Thanks.

47:34.819 --> 47:36.819
Can I get two sodas please?

47:42.927 --> 47:45.628
That was the best pizza
in the world.

47:45.730 --> 47:48.831
Sometimes it's good to remember
where you came from.

47:52.937 --> 47:56.172
I haven't been up this late
in ages.

48:16.261 --> 48:17.393
I think this is the most
beautiful place

48:17.495 --> 48:18.661
in the whole city.

48:20.598 --> 48:22.598
You know, it's crazy 'cause
I always thought New York City

48:22.667 --> 48:25.868
was just a bunch
of big buildings.

48:25.970 --> 48:30.806
This park always reminded me
of Iowa.

48:30.909 --> 48:32.675
Yeah.

48:32.777 --> 48:35.278
I can't get over how big
this city feels.

48:35.380 --> 48:37.513
And if you think about it,

48:37.615 --> 48:39.649
it's really small in land acres.

48:39.751 --> 48:42.752
Always thinking like a farmer.

48:42.854 --> 48:44.253
That was meant to be
a compliment.

48:44.355 --> 48:47.590
Mmmhmm.

48:47.692 --> 48:50.960
Yeah, I can see why you
thrived here.

48:51.062 --> 48:53.829
Granby is just too small
for you.

48:53.932 --> 49:00.569
It had its advantages.

49:00.672 --> 49:02.638
Ben, this has been...

49:02.740 --> 49:05.942
it's kinda been perfect,
these past two days.

49:06.044 --> 49:08.177
Yeah, it has.

49:08.279 --> 49:10.579
How about dinner tonight?

49:29.167 --> 49:29.665
Hi.

49:29.767 --> 49:31.500
Come in.

49:35.773 --> 49:38.207
You look beautiful.

49:38.309 --> 49:41.477
Just a country girl
in a designer dress.

49:42.013 --> 49:44.714
Touché.

49:44.816 --> 49:48.851
Ben, this is amazing.

49:48.953 --> 49:50.453
I really wanted you
to see it.

49:50.555 --> 49:53.923
It took me a lot of years
to get here.

49:54.025 --> 49:55.624
You like it?

49:55.727 --> 49:56.292
Do I like it?

49:56.394 --> 49:57.093
Yeah!

49:57.195 --> 49:57.693
Yeah.

49:57.795 --> 49:59.295
What's not to like?

49:59.397 --> 50:01.530
Well, Jovanna wants
to redecorate.

50:01.632 --> 50:04.867
She wants a cleaner,
modern look.

50:06.404 --> 50:07.937
I don't know.

50:08.039 --> 50:11.173
I kinda like it the way it is.

50:11.275 --> 50:12.541
Make yourself at home.

50:12.643 --> 50:13.709
I'll get us something to drink.

50:13.811 --> 50:15.277
Alright.

50:56.054 --> 50:57.119
Sorry, the piano...

50:57.221 --> 50:59.021
Please, don't stop.

50:59.123 --> 51:02.992
It's probably the last time
it'll get played, anyway.

51:03.094 --> 51:05.294
Jovanna wants to get
rid of it.

51:05.396 --> 51:06.862
Why?

51:06.964 --> 51:09.598
Well, I never have any time
to play

51:09.700 --> 51:12.201
and it's not in keeping
with her vision.

51:13.771 --> 51:15.371
Maybe her vision needs
some revision.

51:18.209 --> 51:19.275
Come on, I'll show
you the terrace.

51:19.377 --> 51:22.344
Ok. Thank you.

51:22.447 --> 51:25.214
I always loved to hear
you play.

51:25.316 --> 51:28.851
I'd go out on the back porch
and close my eyes,

51:28.953 --> 51:30.786
get carried away.

51:30.888 --> 51:33.155
That's why daddy was always
looking for you.

51:38.729 --> 51:41.230
Ben!

51:49.707 --> 51:50.673
Hey, let's...

51:50.775 --> 51:54.176
let's toast to something.

51:54.278 --> 51:57.079
Ok.

51:57.181 --> 52:01.851
Here's to our divorce.

52:01.953 --> 52:04.253
To our divorce.

52:08.126 --> 52:12.428
Ben, this is...
this is incredible.

52:12.530 --> 52:15.498
Yeah, it is.

52:15.600 --> 52:20.503
So you're getting your PhD
in agricultural chemistry?

52:20.605 --> 52:21.437
Yeah, yeah.

52:21.539 --> 52:24.340
Well, to gain credibility.

52:24.442 --> 52:25.941
I'm trying to do this study
that could eliminate

52:26.043 --> 52:28.277
the need for pesticides.

52:28.379 --> 52:28.978
Ambitious.

52:29.080 --> 52:30.713
Yeah, I know.

52:30.815 --> 52:35.084
That's why it's so hard
to get that grant.

52:35.186 --> 52:39.054
What I'm doing is I'm taking
generations of corn

52:39.157 --> 52:41.524
and planting them
in very alkaline soil.

52:41.626 --> 52:45.427
I'm breeding for pest resistance
and...

52:46.998 --> 52:49.064
and then I'm taking herbs
that are natural deterrents

52:49.167 --> 52:52.001
and I'm placing them on
the periphery of the land

52:52.103 --> 52:56.105
and that eliminates the need
for chemical pesticides.

52:56.207 --> 52:58.674
That's beautiful.

52:58.776 --> 53:01.210
You know, I'm pretty good
at writing cheques.

53:01.312 --> 53:02.111
Maybe I could help.

53:02.213 --> 53:03.746
No, no, no.

53:03.848 --> 53:05.981
I don't think that would
sit well with Joe.

53:06.083 --> 53:07.082
Or me, you know.

53:07.185 --> 53:10.486
I kinda have to do this
on my own.

53:10.588 --> 53:11.086
Don't worry, though.

53:11.189 --> 53:13.589
I'll get my grant.

53:13.691 --> 53:15.758
You know, I envy you.

53:15.860 --> 53:17.259
Why?

53:17.361 --> 53:18.994
Your passion.

53:19.096 --> 53:20.729
You're doing something
meaningful.

53:20.831 --> 53:24.200
Well I think you're doing
ok here, Ben.

53:24.302 --> 53:27.503
All I do is buy and sell things.

53:27.605 --> 53:33.509
At the end of the day it seems
hollow somehow.

53:33.611 --> 53:35.911
Sometimes I wonder
what would have happened

53:36.013 --> 53:38.480
if I stayed in Iowa.

53:47.592 --> 53:49.158
Ben, don't go there.

53:49.260 --> 53:55.631
Found out a broken heart
is a great motivator.

53:55.733 --> 53:59.568
I'm just glad you're back
in my life

53:59.670 --> 54:03.072
because you remind me
of who I really am.

54:03.174 --> 54:04.940
Or want to be.

54:05.042 --> 54:10.546
I feel like I sacrificed that
to obtain all this.

54:10.648 --> 54:11.880
Ben.

54:11.983 --> 54:14.550
I'm not back in your life.

54:14.652 --> 54:16.485
You have Jovanna
and I have Joe

54:16.587 --> 54:19.088
and as soon as this divorce
is granted

54:19.190 --> 54:26.629
then we need to move on.

54:26.731 --> 54:28.897
Maybe.

54:29.000 --> 54:29.698
We...

54:29.800 --> 54:35.304
Are both marrying other people.

54:35.406 --> 54:40.209
We've chosen our lives.

54:45.349 --> 54:46.682
This can't happen...

54:49.253 --> 54:50.252
Ben, I'm sorry.

54:50.354 --> 54:51.053
Annie!

54:51.155 --> 54:51.887
Annie!

54:51.989 --> 54:53.322
Thank you for a lovely evening.

54:53.424 --> 54:54.056
<i>I had a wonderful day.</i>

54:54.158 --> 54:54.857
Annie.

54:54.959 --> 54:56.392
<i>Thank you.</i>

55:04.068 --> 55:06.135
Annie!

55:06.237 --> 55:06.769
Annie, wait.

55:06.871 --> 55:07.970
Let me drive you.

55:08.072 --> 55:08.804
It's ok, Hector.

55:08.906 --> 55:09.838
I'm fine.

55:09.940 --> 55:10.706
Please, come on.

55:10.808 --> 55:12.441
Come.

55:53.284 --> 55:55.351
Do you care to talk?

55:55.453 --> 56:00.389
This is just all so strange.

56:00.491 --> 56:02.691
I'm guessing you know
our story by now.

56:02.793 --> 56:04.626
Yeah.

56:04.729 --> 56:07.396
Ben tends to confide in me.

56:07.498 --> 56:10.366
It must be a very confusing
time for both of you.

56:10.468 --> 56:11.166
Yeah, that's the thing.

56:11.268 --> 56:13.635
It's not supposed
to be confusing.

56:13.738 --> 56:17.539
I'm marrying Joe,
he's marrying Jovanna.

56:17.641 --> 56:19.174
End of story.

56:19.276 --> 56:22.644
Except seeing each other has
stirred up some old feelings.

56:22.747 --> 56:24.680
Yeah.

56:24.782 --> 56:27.216
Very old.

56:27.318 --> 56:30.619
I mean, Ben and I
loved each other.

56:30.721 --> 56:32.521
But that was
once upon a time

56:32.623 --> 56:37.726
and all of this is just pining
for what might have been.

56:37.828 --> 56:39.261
I see.

56:39.363 --> 56:41.563
I don't know, I think
I should just go home.

56:41.665 --> 56:46.668
This whole charade has
just gotten too difficult.

56:51.275 --> 56:54.443
Do you mind some advice?

56:54.545 --> 56:57.679
Go ahead.

56:57.782 --> 57:03.018
Do you care about Ben
and his future happiness?

57:03.120 --> 57:04.153
Yeah.

57:04.255 --> 57:05.954
I do.

57:06.056 --> 57:08.524
You see, this charade,

57:08.626 --> 57:12.261
it's also for your
future happiness.

57:12.363 --> 57:13.929
You know, as difficult
as it may be

57:14.031 --> 57:18.066
I think you should just stick
with the plan.

57:18.135 --> 57:21.737
Just stay till Monday.

57:29.046 --> 57:30.746
I guess.

57:30.848 --> 57:35.851
Everything will work out
just as it's supposed to.

57:35.953 --> 57:38.854
My dad always said that.

57:43.594 --> 57:46.662
Annie Hancock, I'm glad
you're staying.

57:46.764 --> 57:47.362
No, no, no.

57:47.465 --> 57:50.365
I got this.

57:50.468 --> 57:53.168
Hector, you're my best friend
in New York,

57:53.270 --> 57:54.603
you know that?

57:56.841 --> 57:58.674
Good night.

57:58.776 --> 58:00.142
Good night.

58:13.624 --> 58:15.524
Don't lose that girl, Ben.

58:34.979 --> 58:37.713
Hey, I've been calling you
all day.

58:37.815 --> 58:40.716
I thought you went back
to Granby.

58:40.818 --> 58:43.285
No, I stayed.

58:43.387 --> 58:45.787
For everybody's sake.

58:45.890 --> 58:48.223
Hector said you two talked.

58:48.325 --> 58:50.993
Is everything ok?

58:51.095 --> 58:52.094
Yeah, yeah.

58:52.196 --> 58:53.161
I'm fine.

58:53.264 --> 58:54.429
As far as I'm concerned,

58:54.532 --> 58:56.098
Monday can't come
fast enough though.

58:56.166 --> 58:59.535
Look, I get it but I still think
we need to talk about

58:59.637 --> 59:01.436
what happened.

59:01.539 --> 59:02.771
Nothing happened.

59:02.873 --> 59:04.039
It's not going to,

59:04.141 --> 59:05.374
so we don't really need
to talk about anything.

59:05.476 --> 59:07.776
Annie!

59:07.878 --> 59:09.511
There you are.

59:09.613 --> 59:10.979
Benny, Benny.

59:13.751 --> 59:15.684
How was Chicago?

59:15.786 --> 59:17.185
You're so sweet to ask.

59:17.288 --> 59:18.253
It was my first magazine cover

59:18.355 --> 59:20.556
so thankfully everything
went perfectly.

59:20.658 --> 59:21.857
Great.

59:21.992 --> 59:23.525
You look beautiful.

59:25.296 --> 59:27.930
If everyone could take
their places, please.

59:28.032 --> 59:29.197
That's my cue.

59:29.300 --> 59:30.399
Ok.

59:30.501 --> 59:31.934
Ladies, if you would assemble
at the foot of the aisle.

59:32.036 --> 59:34.436
Gentlemen, if you would
stand to my left.

59:42.379 --> 59:44.246
And proceed once you're ready.

59:46.617 --> 59:48.050
Now, tomorrow when all the
guests are here at this point

59:48.152 --> 59:51.119
everyone will stand
as the bride enters.

59:58.429 --> 01:00:00.696
And as the bride and her
father approach,

01:00:00.798 --> 01:00:02.130
he gives her away.

01:00:06.971 --> 01:00:11.773
And Ben if you take Jovanna's
hand and face each other.

01:00:11.875 --> 01:00:15.644
And here I'll say a few words
about the happy couple.

01:00:15.746 --> 01:00:18.180
At which point where
you exchange your vows...

01:00:23.887 --> 01:00:27.689
Finally I will pronounce you
husband and wife.

01:00:38.235 --> 01:00:39.434
Hey, Joe.

01:00:39.536 --> 01:00:41.937
<i>Hey, listen Annie,
I've got bad news.</i>

01:00:42.039 --> 01:00:43.839
<i>There's a really big storm
heading our way.</i>

01:00:43.941 --> 01:00:45.574
How bad is it?

01:00:45.676 --> 01:00:48.710
Well, if the river rises
we could lose the crops.

01:00:48.779 --> 01:00:52.981
Ok, well, I'll just...
I'll be home as soon as I can.

01:00:53.083 --> 01:00:54.783
Yeah, ok.

01:00:57.121 --> 01:00:58.987
Annie, everything ok?

01:00:59.089 --> 01:01:01.556
Yeah, there's
a big storm coming,

01:01:01.659 --> 01:01:04.593
the crops are in danger of
flooding so I have to go home.

01:01:04.695 --> 01:01:06.662
What about Monday?

01:01:06.764 --> 01:01:07.262
I don't know.

01:01:07.364 --> 01:01:08.163
I don't know.

01:01:08.265 --> 01:01:10.465
Tony will figure out something.

01:01:10.567 --> 01:01:13.669
All of the corn crops in
my study, they could be gone.

01:01:13.737 --> 01:01:17.839
I mean, everything
that I worked so hard for.

01:01:17.941 --> 01:01:20.275
What about your wedding?

01:01:20.377 --> 01:01:21.743
I'm just going to have to try
to make Joe understand

01:01:21.845 --> 01:01:25.614
and hopefully he'll forgive me
for lying.

01:01:25.716 --> 01:01:29.418
Just have Tony send me the
papers whenever they're settled.

01:01:33.624 --> 01:01:35.424
Goodbye, Ben.

01:01:36.860 --> 01:01:37.392
Annie...

01:01:37.494 --> 01:01:39.828
Just, please, don't.

01:01:45.436 --> 01:01:48.937
The runaway groom.

01:01:49.039 --> 01:01:50.906
What happened to you two?

01:01:51.008 --> 01:01:51.940
Where's Annie running off to?

01:01:52.042 --> 01:01:53.809
Is everything alright?

01:01:55.279 --> 01:01:57.646
No, Jovanna, it's not.

01:02:00.918 --> 01:02:02.884
You and I need to talk.

01:02:36.186 --> 01:02:37.686
Thank you.

01:03:01.011 --> 01:03:02.511
Morning.

01:03:02.613 --> 01:03:04.846
Morning.

01:03:04.915 --> 01:03:07.816
It's a beautiful sunrise,
isn't it, honey?

01:03:07.918 --> 01:03:08.984
Yeah, that was quite the storm.

01:03:09.086 --> 01:03:12.120
I think we saved
most of the crops though.

01:03:14.825 --> 01:03:17.159
We still haven't talked
about what happened.

01:03:17.261 --> 01:03:20.262
That's because nothing
happened.

01:03:20.364 --> 01:03:23.465
Just a bunch of reminiscing.

01:03:23.567 --> 01:03:27.135
Well, anytime you want to talk
about nothing happened,

01:03:27.237 --> 01:03:30.105
I'm always here for you.

01:03:30.207 --> 01:03:33.341
Thanks, mom.

01:03:33.443 --> 01:03:35.977
Any news?

01:03:36.079 --> 01:03:37.679
No.

01:03:37.781 --> 01:03:41.783
Community is taking
too long to deliberate.

01:03:41.885 --> 01:03:44.419
I don't think I'm gonna get
my grant.

01:03:44.521 --> 01:03:46.721
Well, you've gotta hang
in there, honey.

01:03:46.824 --> 01:03:51.059
I'm just trying to do some good,
you know?

01:03:51.161 --> 01:03:53.361
You have done plenty of good.

01:03:53.463 --> 01:03:55.463
You've kept this farm
from going under.

01:03:55.566 --> 01:03:58.333
Mom, we're barely making
our quota.

01:03:58.435 --> 01:04:01.970
Did you know that your dad
almost lost this farm twice?

01:04:02.072 --> 01:04:03.371
What?

01:04:03.473 --> 01:04:07.776
He wasn't good at handling
the pressure or the money.

01:04:07.878 --> 01:04:09.411
He always wanted to work
the land,

01:04:09.513 --> 01:04:10.946
not the books.

01:04:11.048 --> 01:04:13.849
Ben was a big help.

01:04:13.951 --> 01:04:16.384
You knew about that?

01:04:16.486 --> 01:04:18.286
He didn't know that I knew.

01:04:18.388 --> 01:04:20.388
I kept it that way.

01:04:20.490 --> 01:04:24.192
Your dad was a proud man.

01:04:24.294 --> 01:04:27.829
I always thought
he was so in control.

01:04:27.931 --> 01:04:31.433
Girls always like to think
of their daddy that way.

01:04:32.803 --> 01:04:34.236
Yeah.

01:04:36.707 --> 01:04:39.674
Well, I gotta get to work.

01:04:39.776 --> 01:04:42.077
Don't worry, everything's gonna
work out.

01:04:42.179 --> 01:04:43.712
As it's supposed to.

01:04:43.814 --> 01:04:45.313
I know.

01:04:45.415 --> 01:04:47.315
Like dad always said.

01:04:50.954 --> 01:04:52.787
Any other rabbits to pull
out of your hat?

01:04:52.890 --> 01:04:54.256
I'm working on it.

01:05:05.235 --> 01:05:06.067
Good morning, your honour.

01:05:06.169 --> 01:05:07.369
Where is Miss Hancock?

01:05:07.471 --> 01:05:08.603
I specifically asked that
both of your clients

01:05:08.705 --> 01:05:09.738
be here this morning.

01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:11.172
Well, your honour,
it's complicated.

01:05:11.275 --> 01:05:14.943
Your honour, Miss Hancock
had to go back to Iowa

01:05:15.045 --> 01:05:17.345
for an emergency.

01:05:17.447 --> 01:05:22.150
If I could just plead our case.

01:05:22.252 --> 01:05:25.921
I'm not planning on getting
married anytime soon,

01:05:26.023 --> 01:05:28.089
but I'm begging the court
to expedite the divorce

01:05:28.191 --> 01:05:31.893
so Annie can marry her fiancé.

01:05:31.995 --> 01:05:36.231
She deserves to be happy.

01:05:36.333 --> 01:05:39.801
Regardless of your heartfelt
plea on her behalf,

01:05:39.903 --> 01:05:41.970
I'm afraid I can't grant
a divorce at this time

01:05:42.072 --> 01:05:45.106
without hearing
from the other party.

01:05:45.208 --> 01:05:45.907
Next case.

01:05:46.009 --> 01:05:46.474
Your honour...

01:05:46.576 --> 01:05:48.076
I've already ruled.

01:05:48.178 --> 01:05:49.210
We're done.

01:06:05.929 --> 01:06:07.195
It was a nice speech.

01:06:07.297 --> 01:06:08.596
I almost believed it.

01:06:08.699 --> 01:06:10.231
I want Annie to be happy.

01:06:10.334 --> 01:06:11.466
I believe that part.

01:06:11.568 --> 01:06:13.902
Just not about marrying Joe.

01:06:37.995 --> 01:06:38.660
Hey.

01:06:38.762 --> 01:06:41.029
Hey.

01:06:41.131 --> 01:06:43.164
The stars are so bright tonight.

01:06:43.266 --> 01:06:45.667
Nice and clear after the storm.

01:06:45.769 --> 01:06:49.938
Annie, I...

01:06:50.040 --> 01:06:52.774
I got something I'd like to say.

01:06:52.876 --> 01:06:55.443
But first off I'm so glad
you're back.

01:06:55.545 --> 01:07:00.949
You could have told me

01:07:01.051 --> 01:07:05.120
you and Ben were married
all those years ago.

01:07:09.026 --> 01:07:10.525
I'm sorry.

01:07:10.627 --> 01:07:14.629
I just-I didn't know how.

01:07:14.731 --> 01:07:17.132
I want you to know I don't mind
waiting for the divorce

01:07:17.234 --> 01:07:21.202
to come through.

01:07:21.304 --> 01:07:24.839
I'm just glad that we're back
in sync again.

01:07:24.941 --> 01:07:28.109
You and I, we're like
a well-oiled machine,

01:07:28.211 --> 01:07:32.280
you know?

01:07:32.382 --> 01:07:35.450
You know what I mean?

01:07:35.552 --> 01:07:37.619
Not really.

01:07:37.721 --> 01:07:43.291
We plant, we harvest,
we get the job done.

01:07:47.064 --> 01:07:50.799
Look Joe...

01:07:55.172 --> 01:07:58.807
I don't want to be part of
a well-oiled machine.

01:07:58.909 --> 01:08:01.810
It's just a turn-of-phrase,
Annie.

01:08:06.917 --> 01:08:09.417
I really appreciate everything
you've done for me

01:08:09.519 --> 01:08:13.755
over the years, but that,
that's gratitude.

01:08:13.824 --> 01:08:15.757
That's the kind of love you
have towards a friend,

01:08:15.859 --> 01:08:19.928
not the kind of love you build
a marriage on.

01:08:20.029 --> 01:08:22.096
Like you and Ben.

01:08:22.198 --> 01:08:24.099
You know, I can't compete
with a ghost, Annie.

01:08:24.201 --> 01:08:25.934
It's not about me and Ben.

01:08:26.036 --> 01:08:27.102
You sure about that?

01:08:27.203 --> 01:08:30.939
Maybe.

01:08:31.041 --> 01:08:33.207
I don't know.

01:08:33.310 --> 01:08:38.345
It doesn't matter,
he's with Jovanna now.

01:08:38.448 --> 01:08:45.987
Joe... this, this is
about you and me.

01:08:59.603 --> 01:09:00.502
Well, I guess a two-year
engagement

01:09:00.604 --> 01:09:04.506
should have given me
a clue.

01:09:04.608 --> 01:09:05.340
Where are you going?

01:09:05.442 --> 01:09:08.343
I have no idea.

01:09:08.444 --> 01:09:10.645
Don't you dare
go out of my life.

01:09:10.747 --> 01:09:12.913
I can't.

01:09:13.015 --> 01:09:15.082
There's too much work to do.

01:09:43.113 --> 01:09:44.912
That's a lovely piece.

01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:54.455
I was just wrestling
with a few things.

01:09:54.558 --> 01:09:56.124
Have you spoken with her?

01:09:56.226 --> 01:09:58.259
Jovanna will never
speak to me again.

01:09:58.361 --> 01:09:59.928
I embarrassed her.

01:10:00.030 --> 01:10:02.931
She wants nothing to do
with me.

01:10:03.033 --> 01:10:08.803
I meant Annie.

01:10:08.872 --> 01:10:11.005
I've picked up the phone
a dozen times,

01:10:11.107 --> 01:10:12.740
but what would I say?

01:10:12.842 --> 01:10:14.776
She's made it very clear
that she wants the past

01:10:14.878 --> 01:10:18.413
to stay in the past.

01:10:18.515 --> 01:10:20.982
I have a confession to make,
sir.

01:10:21.084 --> 01:10:23.351
I grew very fond of Annie
when she was here

01:10:23.453 --> 01:10:26.354
so I've checked in a few times.

01:10:26.456 --> 01:10:27.021
Is she alright?

01:10:27.123 --> 01:10:28.122
What did she say?

01:10:28.225 --> 01:10:29.190
She's in a bit of a bind.

01:10:29.292 --> 01:10:31.426
She didn't get her funding.

01:10:31.528 --> 01:10:33.428
She must be devastated.

01:10:33.530 --> 01:10:34.429
Perhaps.

01:10:34.531 --> 01:10:36.264
She's a resilient woman.

01:10:36.366 --> 01:10:41.169
However, I thought that it
might present an opportunity.

01:10:41.271 --> 01:10:44.539
I've offered her money,
she turned me down.

01:10:44.641 --> 01:10:47.008
I've never known you to take no
for an answer.

01:10:47.110 --> 01:10:48.910
I don't want to insult her.

01:10:49.012 --> 01:10:50.878
I'm sure you'll find
a graceful way

01:10:50.981 --> 01:10:55.316
to part with your money.

01:10:55.418 --> 01:10:57.218
Maybe so.

01:10:59.923 --> 01:11:02.924
Hector, where would I be
without you?

01:11:03.026 --> 01:11:05.927
Stuck in your penthouse

01:11:06.029 --> 01:11:08.129
when you should be in Iowa.

01:11:18.642 --> 01:11:19.841
Mud.

01:11:19.943 --> 01:11:23.778
What a way to lose a grant.

01:11:23.880 --> 01:11:25.446
How're you doing?

01:11:25.548 --> 01:11:27.315
Hey.

01:11:27.417 --> 01:11:29.217
I'm fine.

01:11:29.319 --> 01:11:32.620
Nothing a little moody walk
in the field can't fix.

01:11:32.722 --> 01:11:34.155
I'm so sorry, Annie.

01:11:34.224 --> 01:11:36.057
It's ok.

01:11:36.159 --> 01:11:38.593
They were worried that
the flood might compromise

01:11:38.695 --> 01:11:43.097
my study but I don't know,
I just think it still worked.

01:11:43.199 --> 01:11:44.565
You did your best.

01:11:44.668 --> 01:11:45.867
I'm proud of you.

01:11:45.969 --> 01:11:48.036
Thanks.

01:11:48.138 --> 01:11:50.371
I'm sorry about you and Joe.

01:11:50.473 --> 01:11:53.641
He seems to be doing ok.

01:11:53.743 --> 01:11:57.478
I hope so.

01:11:57.580 --> 01:12:01.783
I think you did the right thing.

01:12:01.885 --> 01:12:03.951
You just didn't have
that spark.

01:12:04.054 --> 01:12:08.623
Or whatever it was your dad
and I had.

01:12:08.725 --> 01:12:11.359
It's times like this
when I miss him the most.

01:12:13.129 --> 01:12:13.761
Yeah.

01:12:13.863 --> 01:12:16.264
Me too, mom.

01:12:16.366 --> 01:12:19.033
Me too.

01:12:19.135 --> 01:12:21.602
Let's hope for a great
harvest tomorrow.

01:13:23.933 --> 01:13:24.766
<i>Annie?</i>

01:13:26.936 --> 01:13:27.535
Yeah.

01:13:29.773 --> 01:13:30.438
Annie?

01:13:30.540 --> 01:13:30.972
Yeah.

01:13:32.742 --> 01:13:35.176
Everyone's here to start
the harvest.

01:13:35.278 --> 01:13:35.710
You alright?

01:13:35.812 --> 01:13:37.912
Yeah. Fine.

01:13:38.014 --> 01:13:38.880
Shoes.

01:13:38.982 --> 01:13:39.747
See you downstairs.

01:13:39.849 --> 01:13:41.082
Ok.

01:14:06.443 --> 01:14:08.843
Sir, I've got the numbers
on that deal.

01:14:08.945 --> 01:14:11.312
Should we move on this
before the close?

01:14:11.414 --> 01:14:12.613
Tracy, I'm running late.

01:14:12.715 --> 01:14:14.615
You decide.

01:14:15.618 --> 01:14:16.484
Sir?

01:14:16.586 --> 01:14:18.586
Where's he going in such
a rush?

01:14:18.688 --> 01:14:20.354
I have no idea.

01:14:24.360 --> 01:14:26.861
I just got an update,
flight's right on schedule.

01:14:26.963 --> 01:14:28.496
You're sure you want me
to come with you?

01:14:28.598 --> 01:14:29.497
I wouldn't have it
any other way.

01:14:29.599 --> 01:14:30.731
This'll be quite an
adventure for me,

01:14:30.834 --> 01:14:32.500
I've never visited the mid-west.

01:14:32.602 --> 01:14:33.601
You're gonna love it.

01:14:33.703 --> 01:14:36.103
If Annie's any indication,
I'm certain I will.

01:14:36.206 --> 01:14:39.474
They say you never go home
again, but here I go.

01:14:44.080 --> 01:14:45.847
Twelve hour day?

01:14:45.949 --> 01:14:47.982
Thanks so much
for your hard work.

01:14:48.084 --> 01:14:52.720
Alright everybody, so
it is my pleasure to tell you

01:14:52.822 --> 01:14:56.591
that even with the flooded
fields we made our quota!

01:14:56.693 --> 01:14:59.060
Whooo!

01:14:59.162 --> 01:15:01.629
Thank you so much, guys.

01:15:01.731 --> 01:15:03.297
So go out tonight, go to
the harvest festival,

01:15:03.399 --> 01:15:03.931
have a good time.

01:15:04.033 --> 01:15:05.066
Y'all earned it, alright?

01:15:05.168 --> 01:15:06.667
There's some water right
over there by the barn

01:15:06.769 --> 01:15:07.568
if you guys want it.

01:15:07.670 --> 01:15:08.469
Thank you.

01:15:08.571 --> 01:15:10.471
Thank you.

01:15:10.573 --> 01:15:11.239
It was a tough one.

01:15:11.341 --> 01:15:14.642
You did it again.

01:15:14.744 --> 01:15:16.644
We did it again.

01:15:28.525 --> 01:15:30.057
You better go get cleaned up.

01:15:30.159 --> 01:15:32.894
Do your hair and
all that fun stuff.

01:15:32.996 --> 01:15:34.962
I was thinking of wearing
my pink dress.

01:15:35.064 --> 01:15:38.966
Mom, I'm not gonna go
to the harvest festival.

01:15:39.068 --> 01:15:41.135
It's always been your favourite
night of the year.

01:15:41.237 --> 01:15:46.707
I know, but I just can't really
see myself dancing right now.

01:15:46.809 --> 01:15:49.710
I know things have been tough
lately, but trust me.

01:15:49.812 --> 01:15:52.547
Dancing is exactly
what you need.

01:15:56.686 --> 01:15:58.920
McAllister.

01:15:59.022 --> 01:16:01.923
Yeah.

01:16:02.025 --> 01:16:04.225
Really?

01:16:04.327 --> 01:16:06.661
So it's official?

01:16:06.763 --> 01:16:08.596
Thank you.

01:16:08.698 --> 01:16:09.597
Yes!

01:16:09.699 --> 01:16:10.631
I rock!

01:16:10.733 --> 01:16:12.133
Tracy, find Ben!

01:16:12.235 --> 01:16:14.101
It's urgent, urgent good.

01:16:14.203 --> 01:16:15.803
He is gonna be happy.

01:16:18.675 --> 01:16:19.907
<i>I'm glad you came, Annie.</i>

01:16:20.009 --> 01:16:22.176
Dancing is fun.

01:16:22.278 --> 01:16:23.144
I know.

01:16:23.246 --> 01:16:24.312
Come on.

01:16:29.652 --> 01:16:31.586
Annie, come on.

01:16:31.688 --> 01:16:33.087
Let's have some fun.

01:16:33.189 --> 01:16:35.022
Come on.

01:16:35.124 --> 01:16:38.626
Look, it's Marla, hi.

01:16:38.728 --> 01:16:39.827
<i>Hey.</i>

01:16:39.929 --> 01:16:41.596
So nice to see you.

01:16:41.698 --> 01:16:43.164
Are you having fun?

01:16:43.266 --> 01:16:43.831
Good to see you.

01:16:43.933 --> 01:16:44.966
Well, well...

01:16:59.682 --> 01:17:01.248
Welcome to Granby.

01:17:01.351 --> 01:17:04.418
Are you kidding me?

01:17:04.520 --> 01:17:06.253
Nice to see you, too.

01:17:06.356 --> 01:17:09.090
What are you doing here,
Ben?

01:17:09.192 --> 01:17:09.657
No, you know what?

01:17:09.759 --> 01:17:11.325
I don't even care.

01:17:11.427 --> 01:17:12.159
You know what I wanna do?

01:17:12.261 --> 01:17:14.261
I want to pop you
in the mouth.

01:17:14.364 --> 01:17:17.832
But I won't, because I want
Annie to be happy.

01:17:17.934 --> 01:17:20.167
What do you mean?

01:17:20.269 --> 01:17:23.337
Wait, you don't know?

01:17:23.439 --> 01:17:25.206
What?

01:17:25.308 --> 01:17:28.175
We broke up.

01:17:28.277 --> 01:17:30.578
Joe, I'm sorry.

01:17:30.680 --> 01:17:32.213
No, no you're not.

01:17:39.222 --> 01:17:41.889
I'd say we arrived
right on time.

01:18:11.087 --> 01:18:12.820
Going to be fun.

01:18:18.227 --> 01:18:21.662
Excuse me, do you know that
song, "Forever Love"?

01:18:21.764 --> 01:18:24.432
Would you mind playing it?

01:19:02.238 --> 01:19:04.205
What are you doing here?

01:19:04.307 --> 01:19:09.276
Dancing with the love
of my life.

01:19:09.378 --> 01:19:13.214
What about Jovanna?

01:19:13.316 --> 01:19:16.117
We broke up.

01:19:21.157 --> 01:19:23.057
Joe and I... we...

01:19:23.159 --> 01:19:25.593
I know.

01:19:32.735 --> 01:19:34.401
Hi.

01:19:34.504 --> 01:19:36.303
Hi.

01:19:48.384 --> 01:19:50.117
Hey, Joe.

01:19:50.219 --> 01:19:51.852
Hey, Mary-Jane.

01:19:53.022 --> 01:19:53.687
Lou.

01:19:53.790 --> 01:19:56.624
Mary-Lou.

01:19:56.726 --> 01:20:01.996
You look nice.

01:20:02.098 --> 01:20:05.533
When Annie's all out of
your system,

01:20:05.635 --> 01:20:08.102
look me up.

01:20:16.345 --> 01:20:18.979
Can we talk outside?

01:20:34.931 --> 01:20:36.864
Why didn't you call?

01:20:36.966 --> 01:20:38.299
You were with Joe.

01:20:38.401 --> 01:20:41.101
Well then why did you come?

01:20:41.204 --> 01:20:43.237
I heard you didn't get
the grant.

01:20:43.339 --> 01:20:45.472
I wanted to give you the money.

01:20:45.575 --> 01:20:47.241
Ben, I don't need saving.

01:20:47.343 --> 01:20:49.777
Maybe I do.

01:20:49.879 --> 01:20:53.914
I'm tired of buying and selling
and padding my own pocket.

01:20:53.983 --> 01:20:56.684
I want to do something
that matters.

01:20:56.786 --> 01:20:58.485
It's a grant.

01:20:58.588 --> 01:21:02.022
From the "I believe in you"
foundation.

01:21:02.124 --> 01:21:04.925
You can pay me back
after you save the world.

01:21:05.027 --> 01:21:06.794
Every penny.

01:21:11.634 --> 01:21:13.467
Ben!

01:21:16.172 --> 01:21:17.404
How did you find me?

01:21:17.506 --> 01:21:19.540
Tracy tracked you down.

01:21:19.642 --> 01:21:22.176
I finally got the judge
to sign off.

01:21:23.980 --> 01:21:28.349
You two sign on the dotted line
and you are officially divorced

01:21:28.451 --> 01:21:32.052
and free to marry whomever
whenever you want.

01:21:38.394 --> 01:21:41.629
What-what're you doing?

01:21:41.731 --> 01:21:42.897
Sorry.

01:21:42.999 --> 01:21:44.431
What did I miss?

01:21:48.905 --> 01:21:53.073
Miss Annie Hancock,
will you marry me again?

01:21:53.175 --> 01:21:54.942
Yes! Yes!

01:21:59.415 --> 01:22:01.282
I guess I missed a lot.

01:22:13.596 --> 01:22:15.729
True love never dies.

01:22:15.831 --> 01:22:18.499
Sometimes it just takes
a 15-year detour.

01:22:27.076 --> 01:22:30.811
Annie, with this ring
I thee wed.

01:22:37.219 --> 01:22:44.024
Ben, with this ring
I thee wed.

01:22:44.126 --> 01:22:47.728
I now pronounce you
husband and wife.

01:22:47.830 --> 01:22:49.863
You may now kiss the bride.
