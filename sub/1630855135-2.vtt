WEBVTT

00:02.698 --> 00:04.656
You know,
what your problem is?

00:04.656 --> 00:05.744
You don't have a sense of humor.

00:05.744 --> 00:07.050
And the reason
I ditched you is,

00:07.050 --> 00:08.704
because you were being
pompous and you were

00:08.704 --> 00:12.664
lecturing me like I was stupid.

00:12.664 --> 00:14.405
Let me just break the law.

00:14.405 --> 00:17.626
I didn't want to
bring my troubles to work.

00:19.758 --> 00:21.456
We are going into hiding.

00:21.456 --> 00:23.240
The plan is moved up.

00:23.240 --> 00:25.460
We have to go now.

00:25.460 --> 00:26.939
But, Margot, do
you know where we going?

00:26.939 --> 00:28.028
Anne, please?

00:28.028 --> 00:29.681
Not now.
We really have to go.

00:29.681 --> 00:31.118
I don't
know either, Anne.

00:31.118 --> 00:33.076
Well, goodbye then.
No, no, no.

00:33.076 --> 00:34.556
We're not saying goodbye
because we'll see you soon.

00:34.556 --> 00:36.732
I'll find a good home
for him, I promise.

00:36.732 --> 00:38.821
I'm not
leaving him, I'm not.

00:38.821 --> 00:41.302
First, I need
you to just tell me
something, anything.

00:41.302 --> 00:43.217
Smile at the same
time and follow me.

00:43.217 --> 00:45.523
I can't, I can't.
You, you can, you have to.

00:45.523 --> 00:46.655
Have your papers ready.

00:46.655 --> 00:47.917
Look, I am not brave.

00:47.917 --> 00:49.136
So, tell me about it.

00:49.136 --> 00:52.443
Well just get a new bike
and follow me, Margot.

00:57.231 --> 00:58.710
This is a hiding place.

01:20.776 --> 01:23.953
Do you know where
the Frank family is?

01:24.649 --> 01:26.825
Because I do.

01:27.174 --> 01:29.089
Switzerland.

01:30.829 --> 01:36.879
Someone found a piece of paper
Mr. Frank had left behind with

01:36.879 --> 01:39.621
a Swiss address written on it.

01:42.232 --> 01:44.887
You must have known, didn't you?

01:44.887 --> 01:46.715
He must have told you
they were leaving.

01:46.715 --> 01:50.849
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I.

01:51.589 --> 01:52.808
You are
grinding your teeth.

01:52.808 --> 01:54.070
Am I?

01:54.070 --> 01:55.332
Is that what's causing
the pain in my jaw?

01:55.332 --> 01:57.160
It isn't helping, but no.

01:57.160 --> 02:00.468
Your back molar is impacted.

02:00.468 --> 02:02.339
In fact, it needs to come out.

02:02.339 --> 02:06.213
It was hard
enough getting here today.

02:06.213 --> 02:09.694
And I'm, I'm so busy
now that Mr. Frank is gone.

02:09.694 --> 02:11.566
Is there another
way of treating it?

02:12.567 --> 02:17.311
Right, well,
since you are too busy
to have your tooth pulled,

02:19.356 --> 02:23.360
you can try oil
of clove on the gum.

02:23.360 --> 02:26.494
See if the pain goes away.

02:27.016 --> 02:29.149
Thank you.

02:29.714 --> 02:32.152
No, thank you.

02:33.153 --> 02:36.417
It is illegal for you
to see a Jewish dentist.

02:36.417 --> 02:40.160
I know you are taking a
personal risk and, um,

02:41.204 --> 02:43.424
and I'm grateful.

02:43.815 --> 02:47.471
Oh, I'm really not about
to let the Nazis tell me who

02:47.471 --> 02:50.039
can fix my teeth.

02:59.831 --> 03:01.746
Anne's waiting for you.

03:01.746 --> 03:03.400
Oh, really?

03:03.400 --> 03:05.185
Okay. Um, thanks.

03:05.185 --> 03:07.404
And Mr. Frank
wants to talk to you.

03:07.404 --> 03:08.492
Okay.

03:08.492 --> 03:10.059
Hurry,
we're opening soon.

03:10.059 --> 03:12.888
I know, I know, oh.

03:13.497 --> 03:14.324
Hello.

03:14.324 --> 03:15.847
Hello.

03:15.847 --> 03:18.285
Did you stop by the
apartment and see the cat?

03:18.285 --> 03:19.851
Uh, no, no.

03:19.851 --> 03:21.636
Did you see
any of my friends?

03:21.636 --> 03:22.985
No.

03:22.985 --> 03:24.247
Well, who have you seen?

03:24.247 --> 03:25.770
No, no one.

03:25.770 --> 03:26.684
I, I went home last night
and this morning I just went

03:26.684 --> 03:27.903
to the dentist.

03:27.903 --> 03:29.209
So, you did see someone.

03:29.209 --> 03:30.253
You saw the dentist.
How is he?

03:30.253 --> 03:31.472
He's fine.

03:31.472 --> 03:33.343
Um, he thinks you're
in Switzerland.

03:33.343 --> 03:35.040
Hmm.

03:35.040 --> 03:36.607
Dr. Pfeffer, think
we're in Switzerland!

03:36.607 --> 03:39.131
You see?
Our plan worked.

03:39.131 --> 03:40.829
Pfeffer, you saw Pfeffer?
Mm-hmm.

03:40.829 --> 03:43.658
We'll never go
in to the dentist again,

03:43.658 --> 03:46.617
or the doctor,
or outside, or school.

03:46.617 --> 03:48.619
Oh, darling.

03:48.619 --> 03:50.360
We don't...
What are you doing?

03:50.360 --> 03:52.580
Exist.
Margot.
Don't say that.

03:52.580 --> 03:53.798
Why is
Margot on the floor?

03:53.798 --> 03:55.931
She's having
an existential crisis.

03:55.931 --> 03:57.324
No, I'm not.

03:57.324 --> 03:59.543
That's what Pim told me.

04:00.544 --> 04:03.286
Papa, you were talking
about me behind my back?

04:03.286 --> 04:04.461
No.

04:04.461 --> 04:05.984
Let's not fight
about it, please.

04:05.984 --> 04:07.377
There's not much time and
we have to open the office.

04:07.377 --> 04:08.596
Well, I have to
pee and if I have to pee,

04:08.596 --> 04:09.727
that means I exist.

04:09.727 --> 04:10.989
Oh, Anne.
Don't be so disgusting.

04:10.989 --> 04:12.513
Oh, I'm just being human.

04:12.513 --> 04:14.863
Well, go be
human somewhere else.

04:14.863 --> 04:17.344
Miep and I have
business to discuss.

04:17.692 --> 04:18.867
Here's the shopping list.

04:18.867 --> 04:20.260
I need a chicken.

04:20.260 --> 04:21.565
Don't take the first
chicken they offer you.

04:21.565 --> 04:23.654
There's always a better chicken.

04:26.135 --> 04:28.093
Margot, come on.
What are you doing?

04:28.093 --> 04:30.400
It's, it's almost 8:30.

04:31.445 --> 04:32.968
What's the point?

04:32.968 --> 04:36.493
There is none. Go. Hmm.

04:36.798 --> 04:38.843
Margot.

04:46.547 --> 04:48.418
Did you call the salespeople?

04:48.418 --> 04:50.202
Hmm?

04:50.202 --> 04:52.640
The salespeople,
to let them know business
will continue.

04:52.640 --> 04:54.772
Right. Yes.
I mean, no, I didn't.

04:54.772 --> 04:56.252
But I'll do that today.

04:56.252 --> 04:57.862
Miep, if I ask
for something to be done...

04:57.862 --> 05:00.648
No, I'll do it today.
I promise.

05:01.562 --> 05:06.001
Sorry to snap.
I'm worried about Margot.

05:07.481 --> 05:09.134
She's not adjusting well.

05:09.134 --> 05:11.485
Well, is there
anything I can do?

05:11.485 --> 05:13.704
Tell the Allies to hurry?

05:16.359 --> 05:17.708
She likes oranges.

05:17.708 --> 05:21.016
Maybe you could
find her an orange.

05:23.801 --> 05:25.063
8:30.

05:25.063 --> 05:26.500
Don't forget.

05:26.500 --> 05:27.501
Time to go.

05:27.501 --> 05:28.937
I won't, I won't.

05:28.937 --> 05:30.373
Wait, remind me, what
is it I'm not forgetting?

05:30.373 --> 05:31.374
The salespeople.

05:31.374 --> 05:32.506
Sales.

05:32.506 --> 05:34.551
Hmm.
Yes.

05:34.551 --> 05:36.510
How are we going to
keep getting more food?

05:36.510 --> 05:39.730
Margot wants an orange now and
I don't have any food rations.

05:39.730 --> 05:43.386
Um, the Franks almost out
with meat and milk rations too.

05:43.386 --> 05:44.779
I know. I know.

05:44.779 --> 05:46.476
Uh,
we're working on it.

05:46.476 --> 05:50.001
Just try to stretch things
out as long as you can.

05:50.001 --> 05:51.525
Okay.

05:51.525 --> 05:53.875
And, and don't buy
too much at any one place.

05:53.875 --> 05:56.530
I heard a rumor that the
Nazis are paying shopkeepers

05:56.530 --> 06:00.534
to alert them to people
who buy large amounts of food.

06:00.534 --> 06:02.666
Right, great.

06:14.112 --> 06:15.592
Jan Gies.

06:15.592 --> 06:17.507
I'm meeting a
friend later and I'd like to

06:17.507 --> 06:19.030
bring her an orange.

06:19.030 --> 06:21.032
So, bring her an orange.

06:21.032 --> 06:23.165
<i>MIEP [over phone]:
I don't have one.</i>

06:24.166 --> 06:26.864
Well, that may be a need
to bring your friend a potato.

06:26.864 --> 06:29.214
What would you do if
you're expecting an orange and

06:29.214 --> 06:30.868
someone bought you a potato?

06:30.868 --> 06:32.957
I'd happily eat the potato.

06:32.957 --> 06:37.005
Okay.
Yeah, but you're just like that.

06:37.484 --> 06:41.618
Maybe it's time.
You went that place?

06:42.271 --> 06:44.839
No, I was
thinking you could get
some extra ration books.

06:45.274 --> 06:48.669
Fine.
I'll see what I can do.

06:49.670 --> 06:50.714
Thank you for the call.

06:50.714 --> 06:52.412
It was a pleasure
speaking to you.

07:00.681 --> 07:01.986
Oh.

07:05.120 --> 07:06.948
Paychecks
aren't ready yet.

07:06.948 --> 07:08.297
Oh, no.

07:08.297 --> 07:11.474
That's, uh, that's
not what I'm here for.

07:12.344 --> 07:16.305
I, uh, visited a client
yesterday who's unable to work

07:16.827 --> 07:18.481
due to health issues.

07:18.481 --> 07:22.398
A bit of bad luck,
she lost her ration book.

07:22.703 --> 07:24.618
She needs to
report it to the Ration Board.

07:24.618 --> 07:25.967
Of course. Of course.

07:25.967 --> 07:29.840
And, and she would, but sadly,

07:29.840 --> 07:31.625
her health is so poor
that it's difficult for her

07:31.625 --> 07:33.104
to get out.

07:33.104 --> 07:37.457
So, I thought, you know,
we have emergency rations.

07:38.632 --> 07:41.112
The government
is very strict these days.

07:41.112 --> 07:43.288
We have to account
for everything.

07:43.288 --> 07:44.725
Yes, of course.

07:44.725 --> 07:46.727
They want to
make sure we're not,

07:46.727 --> 07:48.511
what's the word they use?

07:48.511 --> 07:51.906
Aiding those that have
chosen to flout the law and

07:51.906 --> 07:53.560
go into hiding.

07:53.560 --> 07:56.432
Oh, no, no.
She, I mean, she's not.

07:56.432 --> 08:00.654
She's a, she's a client.
She's, she's not hiding.

08:02.830 --> 08:06.747
Well, I suppose
we can spare a few.

08:09.663 --> 08:12.230
Fantastic.

08:17.105 --> 08:21.326
Jan, I need your client
reports by the end of the day.

08:21.326 --> 08:23.241
Yes. On it.

08:24.634 --> 08:27.550
Just an extra
coupon for a client.

08:28.203 --> 08:30.205
That'll be included
in your reports, I assume?

08:30.205 --> 08:31.728
Yeah, yeah, of course.

08:31.728 --> 08:33.817
End of the day.

08:41.390 --> 08:45.220
Oh, he's very scrawny.
Not you, the chicken.

08:45.220 --> 08:49.050
You look very, very healthy.

08:49.398 --> 08:50.834
And I wonder if I could
have a chicken who looks a

08:50.834 --> 08:52.967
little bit more like you?

08:52.967 --> 08:55.839
A little more meat
on it perhaps?

09:01.453 --> 09:03.586
Lovely.

09:04.021 --> 09:06.197
Oh, could you spare a few more?

09:06.197 --> 09:09.679
My nephews are visiting.

09:10.245 --> 09:12.856
My mother's cough
just won't quit.

09:12.856 --> 09:15.816
The doctors say it
could be pneumonia.

09:15.816 --> 09:19.428
It's really, really difficult,
but we soldier on, don't we?

09:20.821 --> 09:23.650
Here, a little extra
cheese for your poor mother.

09:41.842 --> 09:45.019
They cleared everything
from the Frank's apartment.

09:45.019 --> 09:48.326
The cat must have gotten out
when the movers opened the door.

09:49.371 --> 09:50.633
Was it Puls?

09:50.633 --> 09:52.504
Of course.

09:52.504 --> 09:55.812
They're to ransack
the place and send all
the valuables to Germany.

09:56.508 --> 09:58.249
Well, maybe the cat got
into a dresser and will jump

09:58.249 --> 10:01.339
out and scratch some Nazi's
eye out when it gets to Germany.

10:02.036 --> 10:04.691
That's a
beautiful thought.

10:05.474 --> 10:07.302
How did Anne take it?

10:07.302 --> 10:09.957
I didn't tell her.
I didn't tell any of them.

10:09.957 --> 10:11.741
I couldn't bear it.

10:11.741 --> 10:14.526
So, what, what did you,
you, you just.

10:14.526 --> 10:17.573
Lied.
I'm getting quite good at it.

10:17.573 --> 10:18.748
"Your cat's fine.

10:18.748 --> 10:20.837
I have no idea where
the Franks are.

10:20.837 --> 10:22.360
You are so handsome.

10:22.360 --> 10:24.928
Can I have a
bigger chicken, please?"

10:24.928 --> 10:26.451
You're flirting
with the butcher?

10:26.451 --> 10:27.888
Not just one butcher.

10:27.888 --> 10:29.672
I'm flirting with every
butcher in Amsterdam.

10:29.672 --> 10:31.587
I'm gonna start getting a
reputation as the woman who'll

10:31.587 --> 10:34.068
do anything for a sausage.

10:36.374 --> 10:38.768
Flash your boob
for a bratwurst.

10:40.291 --> 10:41.858
Your knickers for a knockwurst.

10:41.858 --> 10:42.990
Stop it, Jan!

10:42.990 --> 10:44.078
I'm soaked.

10:44.078 --> 10:45.253
Stop it, stop it!

10:45.253 --> 10:46.558
Oh, my tooth's really hurt.

10:46.558 --> 10:49.518
Stop, stop, all right,
I'm getting in.

10:50.127 --> 10:52.260
No. Mrs. Stoppelman's
in the next room.

10:52.260 --> 10:54.566
I know, we'll be quiet. Oh.

10:57.569 --> 10:58.875
Every time the doorbell rings,

10:58.875 --> 11:01.704
I think it's a Nazi
here to arrest me.

11:01.704 --> 11:03.575
A Nazi wouldn't
ring the bell.

11:03.575 --> 11:04.707
I'm scared.

11:04.707 --> 11:06.840
I'm gonna check.

11:08.711 --> 11:10.017
And if, if it's a Nazi,

11:10.017 --> 11:11.975
can you ask him if
I can finish my bath?

11:12.976 --> 11:15.762
Absolutely not.

11:31.778 --> 11:33.518
Hi.

11:34.781 --> 11:38.088
Who are you?
Who are you?

11:39.916 --> 11:41.483
Alfred, where did you go?

11:41.483 --> 11:42.919
Okay. Frannie,
we'll talk about it later.

11:42.919 --> 11:44.355
Miep!

11:44.355 --> 11:46.967
This is my daughter,
Frannie and her husband, Lou.

11:46.967 --> 11:48.316
Hi, nice to meet you.

11:48.316 --> 11:49.578
Oh, nice to meet you.
Oh, there you are.

11:49.578 --> 11:50.753
He's Alfred.

11:50.753 --> 11:51.841
Hello.
Hello.

11:51.841 --> 11:52.973
Nice to meet you.

11:52.973 --> 11:54.191
You've already met Liddy.

11:54.191 --> 11:55.410
Oh, my gosh.
Sorry about that.

11:55.410 --> 11:56.541
It's fine.

11:56.541 --> 11:57.934
Uh, we
live in Leiden, but.

11:57.934 --> 11:59.370
They were ordered out.

11:59.370 --> 12:00.894
By Mr. Hitler.

12:00.894 --> 12:02.199
Jews can't stay
in the countryside anymore.

12:02.199 --> 12:04.462
We have to register
in the city, so...

12:04.462 --> 12:05.768
Here we are.

12:05.768 --> 12:07.770
I'm so sorry you
had to leave your home.

12:07.770 --> 12:09.206
We won't
be staying long.

12:09.206 --> 12:10.599
You can
stay as long as you want.

12:10.599 --> 12:11.818
And do what?

12:11.818 --> 12:13.167
Wait for them to come
get me and kill me?

12:13.167 --> 12:14.646
Frannie!

12:14.646 --> 12:15.996
Who's gonna kill you?

12:15.996 --> 12:17.867
Oh, no
one's killing anyone.

12:17.867 --> 12:20.043
Mommy's just being grumpy.

12:20.043 --> 12:20.957
Per usual.

12:20.957 --> 12:22.829
Lou, not helpful.

12:22.829 --> 12:25.179
I'm gonna kill you
with my tickle fingers!

12:26.571 --> 12:28.225
Wait, we can go
and stay at my parents,

12:28.225 --> 12:29.966
give you some space, Jan?

12:29.966 --> 12:30.967
Yes, of course.

12:30.967 --> 12:32.447
Oh.

12:32.447 --> 12:34.057
Thank you, but we can
just stay in the living room.

12:34.057 --> 12:35.972
My mother really
needs your rent money.

12:35.972 --> 12:39.976
Where are you going to
go so Hitler doesn't get you?

12:39.976 --> 12:41.456
Oh.

12:41.456 --> 12:42.979
Oh, sweetheart.
They don't need to go anywhere.

12:42.979 --> 12:44.938
They're not Jewish.

12:44.938 --> 12:47.070
Lucky!

13:00.475 --> 13:02.956
Good morning.
How are our friends today?

13:02.956 --> 13:05.480
Friends, do you
have any friends except me?

13:05.480 --> 13:07.047
More importantly,
how are you?

13:07.047 --> 13:08.700
Tess.

13:08.700 --> 13:09.614
I just got to the Cas
and he told me about the Franks.

13:09.614 --> 13:11.051
I came right over.

13:11.051 --> 13:12.530
Oh, I've been meaning
to call, I have, I...

13:12.530 --> 13:14.445
No. It's fine.
You've obviously been swamped.

13:14.445 --> 13:16.360
Can we talk about
how Cas is still single?

13:16.360 --> 13:19.015
I mean, seriously?
Have you met her brother?

13:19.015 --> 13:21.931
So cute and funny and
his dark brown eyes just

13:21.931 --> 13:23.846
bore into your soul.

13:23.846 --> 13:25.674
I mean, ugh, wow.

13:25.674 --> 13:26.762
Are you single?

13:26.762 --> 13:29.504
Yeah.
Oh, snap him up.

13:30.766 --> 13:32.507
So, what happened to the Franks?

13:32.507 --> 13:35.118
They just, they
just disappeared.

13:35.118 --> 13:36.250
You didn't know?

13:36.250 --> 13:37.729
No.

13:37.729 --> 13:39.122
Not even in retrospect?
There were no clues?

13:39.122 --> 13:40.732
Come on.

13:40.732 --> 13:42.212
Let's go to breakfast so
you can tell me all about it.

13:42.212 --> 13:44.475
Uh, I can't, I've
got way too much to work on.

13:44.475 --> 13:46.260
Well, lunch?
Dinner? Drinks?

13:46.260 --> 13:48.871
I mean, I have
nothing but free time,

13:48.871 --> 13:50.830
because I quit my job.

13:50.830 --> 13:52.440
Really?
Yeah.

13:52.440 --> 13:54.268
I used to work as an
usher at the Opera.

13:54.268 --> 13:57.314
And I know it sounds fabulous,
but, ugh, my boss,

13:57.314 --> 14:00.100
he was so mean and I had
to be on my feet all day.

14:00.100 --> 14:03.277
And you know what, I hate opera.

14:04.365 --> 14:07.890
I do. I said it.
Ugh, I feel so free.

14:08.586 --> 14:10.850
So, Daniel is gonna pay
for me to go to the

14:10.850 --> 14:13.330
Fashion Institute to
learn pattern-making.

14:13.983 --> 14:15.724
He thinks that I
could sell my dresses.

14:15.724 --> 14:17.639
I mean, I made this.

14:18.161 --> 14:20.903
What do you think, yeah?

14:20.903 --> 14:23.558
It's gorgeous.
Beautiful. Yeah. Yes.

14:23.558 --> 14:25.734
Ugh, do you like it?
Really, you wouldn't lie?

14:25.734 --> 14:26.822
Yes.

14:26.822 --> 14:31.871
Oh.
So, when can I see you?

14:33.220 --> 14:34.830
As soon as
work slows down.

14:34.830 --> 14:37.006
It's just, just.

14:37.615 --> 14:41.402
All you do is work.
I mean, it used to be fun.

14:41.402 --> 14:43.143
We used to have a lot of fun.

14:43.143 --> 14:45.188
You know, she used to
be really, really fun.

14:45.188 --> 14:47.756
Oh, she's still fun.

14:47.756 --> 14:49.801
She doesn't look very fun.

14:49.801 --> 14:53.153
I'll call you.
And I'll be fun again.

14:54.981 --> 15:00.421
Okay, goodbye.

15:03.815 --> 15:05.948
How did she get in?
We're not even open yet.

15:05.948 --> 15:07.471
Our friends are still
walking around upstairs.

15:07.471 --> 15:08.995
I was coming in and
she demanded that I let her

15:08.995 --> 15:10.257
in to wait.

15:10.257 --> 15:11.432
She's very persuasive.

15:11.432 --> 15:14.000
Oh, she is.
You're right, I'm sorry.

15:14.696 --> 15:17.133
Would you buy that dress?

15:17.133 --> 15:19.919
No one would
buy that dress.

15:21.746 --> 15:24.706
All right, I might be wrong.

15:31.974 --> 15:33.889
Oh, my, Anne.

15:33.889 --> 15:36.500
My life is tragic.
What happened?

15:36.500 --> 15:38.285
The Van Pels
arrived this morning,

15:38.285 --> 15:41.853
and Peter was allowed
to bring his stupid cat.

15:43.029 --> 15:44.900
What?

15:46.510 --> 15:47.729
Miep.

15:47.729 --> 15:49.557
Hello! I'm confused.

15:49.557 --> 15:50.862
I didn't realize
you were coming.

15:50.862 --> 15:52.386
I thought it was next week.

15:52.386 --> 15:54.823
We've been hearing
rumors of the call-ups and

15:54.823 --> 15:57.347
we were worried about Peter.

15:57.695 --> 16:00.524
Some people
still care about the
well-being of their children.

16:00.524 --> 16:01.743
Anne.

16:01.743 --> 16:03.136
You said I
couldn't bring my cat,

16:03.136 --> 16:04.789
because he would
make too much noise.

16:04.789 --> 16:07.401
Is there something
special about his cat?

16:07.401 --> 16:09.620
Is your cat a silent cat, Peter?

16:09.620 --> 16:12.667
Of course,
it's not a silent cat.

16:13.929 --> 16:15.322
It will be fine.

16:15.322 --> 16:18.020
He's a, he, he's a good cat.

16:18.020 --> 16:20.066
Hmm.
My cat is a good cat too.

16:20.066 --> 16:21.545
Oh, but, when I asked
if I could bring him,

16:21.545 --> 16:23.025
then you just said I couldn't.

16:23.025 --> 16:24.331
Anne, please.

16:24.331 --> 16:25.636
Let's change the
subject and make our friends

16:25.636 --> 16:27.899
feel welcome, yeah?

16:27.899 --> 16:29.945
Welcome.

16:29.945 --> 16:31.468
Thank you.

16:31.468 --> 16:33.470
You have to be quiet
all day and you also have to

16:33.470 --> 16:35.081
pee in a bucket.

16:35.081 --> 16:36.256
But, you know, at least you'll
have your cat for comfort.

16:36.256 --> 16:37.474
Anne...

16:37.474 --> 16:39.172
You're upsetting
your mother, Anne.

16:39.172 --> 16:40.303
Please.

16:40.303 --> 16:41.783
What?
It's just not fair.

16:41.783 --> 16:43.263
Miep is the only one who
actually cares visiting the

16:43.263 --> 16:45.482
cat at the apartment to
make sure he's all right.

16:45.482 --> 16:47.310
How?

16:47.789 --> 16:49.269
Puls raided your old apartment.

16:49.269 --> 16:52.272
There's nothing there anymore.

17:00.410 --> 17:03.457
You said you saw him,
that he was fat and happy.

17:03.457 --> 17:06.329
You fed him herring.

17:08.331 --> 17:11.073
Um, I know.
I, I, I should have told you.

17:11.073 --> 17:13.902
I didn't want to upset you.

17:13.902 --> 17:16.296
You lied to me?

17:16.774 --> 17:18.776
You lied to me.

17:18.776 --> 17:21.344
Oh, well, I, I didn't,

17:21.344 --> 17:23.781
I'm really sorry, Anne, I.

17:24.130 --> 17:27.263
Are we never
gonna see him again?

17:30.353 --> 17:32.355
Our furniture is gone?

17:32.355 --> 17:36.316
Yes.
Everything?

17:37.795 --> 17:41.016
Yes.
It's only furniture.

17:41.364 --> 17:42.974
No, it's
not just furniture.

17:42.974 --> 17:44.324
It's my grandmother's
dining room set.

17:44.324 --> 17:46.282
It's all I have of her.

17:46.282 --> 17:48.371
I'm going to lie down, yeah?

17:48.371 --> 17:50.721
Edith.

17:57.467 --> 17:59.774
I thought they knew.

18:00.296 --> 18:01.906
Now, they don't like me.

18:01.906 --> 18:04.518
Oh, yes, they do.
Of course, we do, Peter.

18:04.518 --> 18:07.347
You should
have told us the truth.

18:09.827 --> 18:12.395
I'm sorry.

18:20.447 --> 18:25.278
Oh, I brought, I bought,
I bought oranges for you.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.727
<i>JAN [over phone]: Jan Gies.</i>

18:39.727 --> 18:41.772
Do you know
the guests who were
coming later this month?

18:41.772 --> 18:43.209
<i>MEIP [over phone]:
Well, they came early and now
I'm wondering how many chickens</i>

18:43.209 --> 18:45.515
<i>I'll get if I sleep
with the butcher?</i>

18:45.515 --> 18:47.343
I'gonna say three?

18:47.343 --> 18:48.779
<i>MIEP [over phone]:
It's not funny.</i>

18:48.779 --> 18:51.217
My tooth
is hurting so much.

18:51.217 --> 18:52.566
I can't do this.

18:52.566 --> 18:54.829
You can.
You are doing it.

18:54.829 --> 18:56.483
I'm in so much pain.

18:56.483 --> 18:57.919
Gies?

18:57.919 --> 18:59.877
I'm sorry, I got to go.

19:00.443 --> 19:01.618
I'm sorry, I
didn't mean to disturb.

19:01.618 --> 19:03.620
Oh, no, it's fine.
It's just my wife.

19:03.620 --> 19:05.492
Ah. Wives.

19:05.492 --> 19:07.146
You close?

19:07.146 --> 19:08.321
To my wife?

19:08.321 --> 19:10.410
Yes, yes, she's my wife.

19:10.410 --> 19:12.455
Of course.

19:13.543 --> 19:16.546
I noticed a problem with
your client reports.

19:16.546 --> 19:19.810
Duuk Philips, a teacher, yes?

19:19.810 --> 19:21.769
Yes.

19:21.769 --> 19:23.336
He's been out of
work for several months despite

19:23.336 --> 19:25.555
there being ample
openings teaching Dutch

19:25.555 --> 19:27.905
to German officers
and their families.

19:27.905 --> 19:30.691
Mr. Philips
is an art teacher.

19:30.691 --> 19:33.563
And there are no
openings for teaching art?

19:33.563 --> 19:36.566
Did you tell him about the
openings for teaching Dutch?

19:36.566 --> 19:38.264
Hmm, I did.

19:38.264 --> 19:42.659
He, um, he wasn't, he didn't
seem to think it was a good fit.

19:43.747 --> 19:46.750
In what way?

19:47.273 --> 19:51.059
Um, my sense was that as
an artist and a free thinking

19:51.059 --> 19:54.062
type person, maybe,
and he didn't say this,

19:54.062 --> 19:55.542
so don't quote me,

19:55.542 --> 19:57.848
but maybe his political
leanings would make the job

19:57.848 --> 19:59.894
difficult for him.

19:59.894 --> 20:02.070
I see.

20:02.070 --> 20:04.942
Unfortunately, when a
client rejects a job interview,

20:04.942 --> 20:08.381
policy is that we
cut off their benefits,

20:08.381 --> 20:12.559
but I see that you've
extended them for Mr. Philips.

20:13.386 --> 20:19.392
I wonder if you sympathize
with his political leanings?

20:22.264 --> 20:25.528
It was a mistake.
Just a clerical error.

20:30.968 --> 20:33.971
Okay, great.
Thank you, sir.

20:55.645 --> 20:57.604
Um, Katrien, we
just wanted to reassure
all our salespeople that

20:57.604 --> 20:59.258
although Mr. Frank is...

21:02.043 --> 21:03.479
Gone now, Opekta
still as strong as ever.

21:03.479 --> 21:05.351
Oh, thank goodness.

21:05.351 --> 21:07.831
Karl thought maybe you
called me in to let me go.

21:07.831 --> 21:09.529
No, no, no, of course not.

21:09.529 --> 21:10.834
How is Karl, by the way?

21:15.535 --> 21:17.624
He's fine.
Well, as you know we've been
having our ups and downs,

21:17.624 --> 21:21.454
but just the other day, the
most wonderful thing happened.

21:21.976 --> 21:23.630
He proposed!

21:23.630 --> 21:24.848
Finally.

21:26.981 --> 21:28.504
It's been three
years and I told him that I
wasn't going to wait forever...

21:35.206 --> 21:36.904
Look at the ring.

21:36.904 --> 21:39.472
It's a fake sapphire,
but you can't even tell.

21:39.472 --> 21:40.821
Wow, Ms. Katrien.
It's so gorgeous.

21:40.821 --> 21:42.213
Wow. Oh, It's beautiful.

21:42.213 --> 21:43.606
I know.
Yeah, congratulations.

21:43.606 --> 21:45.216
Congratulations, Katrien.

21:45.216 --> 21:46.914
If we'd have known,
we would've got a cake.

22:01.842 --> 22:04.279
I talked to
the salespeople.

22:04.279 --> 22:06.716
Thank you.
Katrien's engaged.

22:07.630 --> 22:10.024
That's nice.

22:10.372 --> 22:12.983
Did you know her fiance,
Karl met the Queen once?

22:12.983 --> 22:14.463
This was a few years ago.

22:14.463 --> 22:16.639
The Queen wanted to take
Princess Juliana fishing and

22:16.639 --> 22:17.771
he's a fisherman.

22:17.771 --> 22:19.816
Apparently the
Princess got seasick.

22:19.816 --> 22:21.731
Mm-hmm.

22:30.784 --> 22:32.568
Mr. Frank, I'm,
I'm really sorry I didn't

22:32.568 --> 22:35.005
tell you about Puls.

22:43.405 --> 22:45.712
I understand.

22:45.712 --> 22:48.628
Bringing bad news to a group of
people starving for something

22:48.628 --> 22:53.110
positive isn't easy, but you
have to tell me everything if

22:53.110 --> 22:55.417
this is going to work.

22:55.417 --> 22:57.680
Well, you have to
tell me everything then, too!

22:57.680 --> 22:59.769
You didn't tell me
about the Van Pels.

22:59.769 --> 23:01.597
I only knew
a few days ago.

23:01.597 --> 23:05.601
And I only knew about
your apartment yesterday!

23:06.950 --> 23:10.389
Okay. We're learning.

23:10.911 --> 23:11.868
Now, if you don't
mind I have to...

23:11.868 --> 23:15.394
You're out
of ration books.

23:17.091 --> 23:19.528
I'm telling you everything.

23:20.834 --> 23:23.924
We have a
year's worth of, uh,

23:23.924 --> 23:27.362
beans and rice in the attic,
and anything else we need we

23:27.362 --> 23:28.798
can buy on the Black Market.

23:28.798 --> 23:31.497
The Black Market
prices are skyrocketing.

23:31.497 --> 23:33.368
Please, Miep I
have to finish this book.

23:33.368 --> 23:36.327
I heard a rumor that you
can get ration books for people

23:36.327 --> 23:40.201
in hiding at the Como Bookstore.

23:40.201 --> 23:41.768
Who told you this?

23:41.768 --> 23:44.988
Someone told Jan.

23:44.988 --> 23:47.513
Half these rumors are
started by the Nazis, Miep.

23:47.513 --> 23:49.210
And half of them aren't.

23:49.210 --> 23:51.386
And if it's a trap?

23:51.386 --> 23:54.694
I can tell a
Nazi from a non-Nazi.

23:55.259 --> 23:57.871
Karl's a Nazi.

23:57.871 --> 24:01.178
Who?
Katrien's fisherman.

24:01.178 --> 24:03.485
He joined the Dutch
Nazi Party last year.

24:03.485 --> 24:05.531
That's why he didn't come
to our picnic in the spring,

24:05.531 --> 24:07.794
because I'd be there.

24:07.794 --> 24:10.797
My family would be there.

24:10.797 --> 24:12.755
Katrien was upset with him,

24:12.755 --> 24:15.192
but if she's agreeing to
marry him she must at least

24:15.192 --> 24:19.196
find his views palatable.

24:19.632 --> 24:21.851
But it's Katrien.
She's so...

24:21.851 --> 24:26.029
Nice, funny,
down to earth?

24:26.029 --> 24:27.988
Good at her job?

24:27.988 --> 24:31.557
And, now, engaged to a Nazi.

24:33.559 --> 24:36.475
I hate that I can't go to Como,
and look the person in the eye,

24:36.475 --> 24:39.652
and judge for myself.

24:43.917 --> 24:46.572
Wait, wait, wait wait,
I don't know if this
is a good idea.

24:46.572 --> 24:49.052
This is the
only idea we've got.

24:49.052 --> 24:50.924
What did they say to do?

24:50.924 --> 24:53.448
Discreetly identify
yourselves as sympathizers with

24:53.448 --> 24:56.146
the Resistance and ask for help.

24:57.060 --> 24:59.889
Oh, I don't know,
I don't know.

24:59.889 --> 25:02.849
Let's just see,
let's just see.

25:02.849 --> 25:04.154
We can do, we can do this.

25:04.154 --> 25:08.071
Okay.
Yeah?
Okay, let's do it.

25:14.774 --> 25:17.385
What about him?

25:18.168 --> 25:19.953
That's how a
Nazi would stack books.

25:19.953 --> 25:22.564
Look at the brutal efficiency.

25:24.523 --> 25:26.525
What about her?

25:26.525 --> 25:30.224
She looks like a kind of person
who would help hide Jews.

25:31.138 --> 25:33.053
Based on what?

25:33.053 --> 25:35.142
Nice sweater.

25:36.099 --> 25:37.884
She's probably hiding a
sniper rifle under her skirt.

25:37.884 --> 25:39.059
Look at her.

25:39.059 --> 25:40.364
Now, are you
making fun of me?

25:40.364 --> 25:42.497
Yeah, I am.

25:50.940 --> 25:52.986
What are you doing?

25:55.597 --> 25:57.860
They play this
song on Radio Orange.

25:57.860 --> 26:00.123
I'm discreetly
identifying myself.

26:00.515 --> 26:02.517
Jan, that song
makes fun of Nazis!

26:02.517 --> 26:05.389
Yeah, I know,
it's a mating call.

26:08.523 --> 26:10.612
Stop it,
people are looking.

26:10.612 --> 26:11.874
Stop.

26:11.874 --> 26:13.702
Sir, I don't know him.
I don't know him.

26:13.702 --> 26:16.139
I'm leaving.
I'm going outside.

26:17.227 --> 26:20.796
Sir, please,
this is a bookstore.

26:24.713 --> 26:28.978
I'm sorry, I got this
silly song in my head.

26:33.026 --> 26:36.072
Hello.
Hello.

26:36.072 --> 26:38.074
Hello.

26:38.074 --> 26:41.774
We're looking for
help and you look like the

26:41.774 --> 26:46.213
sort of person who
might be able to help us.

26:52.654 --> 26:56.005
Can you help us?

27:03.012 --> 27:05.145
We need your
identification papers.

27:05.145 --> 27:06.450
For good?

27:06.450 --> 27:07.974
They're gonna
make new ones,

27:07.974 --> 27:10.324
fake ones that I can
then use to get rations.

27:10.324 --> 27:12.021
And our old papers?

27:12.021 --> 27:15.634
They will be destroyed.

27:16.896 --> 27:21.074
Margot's right.
We really won't exist anymore.

27:21.074 --> 27:22.771
Go back to
your room, Anne.

27:22.771 --> 27:25.513
I wanna know what
you're talking about.

27:27.254 --> 27:30.039
Come. Close the door.

27:30.474 --> 27:32.085
What do you think?

27:32.085 --> 27:34.000
I don't know.

27:34.000 --> 27:36.089
If you think you can
trust these people?

27:36.089 --> 27:38.047
I do, yes.

27:38.047 --> 27:39.222
Miep?

27:39.222 --> 27:41.877
Uh-hmm, yes, yeah,
I can trust them.

27:41.877 --> 27:43.444
So why do you
look so miserable?

27:43.444 --> 27:44.837
Oh, sorry.

27:44.837 --> 27:46.795
I mean, my tooth
is hurting a bit.

27:46.795 --> 27:48.101
I thought you
went to the dentist.

27:48.101 --> 27:49.711
I did.

27:49.711 --> 27:51.495
I did, but he said it needs to
be pulled and there was no time.

27:51.495 --> 27:53.236
He said it would
take a few hours.

27:53.236 --> 27:55.891
And you don't have a
few hours because getting food

27:55.891 --> 27:59.286
for us is a full-time job.

28:03.029 --> 28:06.597
We really need
these ration books, sir.

28:06.597 --> 28:08.948
Hmm.

28:09.775 --> 28:13.039
Go to my briefcase
and get our papers.

28:13.039 --> 28:14.954
Go.

28:32.972 --> 28:35.931
You're very brave.

28:36.976 --> 28:38.586
Thank you.

28:38.586 --> 28:41.241
I'm still your
employer Miep and I insist

28:41.241 --> 28:44.766
you get your tooth fix
before you come back to work.

28:44.766 --> 28:49.640
Yes, I will.
You can be brave too.

29:08.181 --> 29:09.922
You were right.

29:09.922 --> 29:12.751
I feel so much better
with that tooth out.

29:12.751 --> 29:16.406
Oh, am I still drooling?
I can't tell. It's numb.

29:17.973 --> 29:20.759
Please sit.

29:29.419 --> 29:32.205
Hey, you remember Lottie?

29:32.205 --> 29:33.815
My fiance, you met her.

29:33.815 --> 29:36.775
Yes.
At the, at the Frank's.

29:36.775 --> 29:41.910
This was her idea.
She said, "Ask Miep."

29:44.652 --> 29:47.263
Ask Miep what?

29:50.049 --> 29:53.617
I need to hide.

29:54.444 --> 29:57.143
Oh.

29:58.274 --> 30:02.278
Yes, you see,
Lottie is a Christian and we

30:02.278 --> 30:05.716
thought this would protect
me from the work camps,

30:05.716 --> 30:11.200
but lately the rumors
suggest that it's, uh,

30:11.200 --> 30:14.682
only a matter of time.

30:15.204 --> 30:18.729
I'm, I'm terrified.

30:19.687 --> 30:24.605
Less so for myself,
but for Lottie.

30:25.562 --> 30:29.088
If they arrest me,
will they arrest her?

30:29.479 --> 30:33.179
I can't bear to think of it.

30:35.355 --> 30:36.835
Dr. Pfeffer...

30:36.835 --> 30:38.097
I'm sorry.

30:38.097 --> 30:40.882
Don't be.
It's fine, it's fine really.

30:40.882 --> 30:44.277
Don't worry.

30:47.715 --> 30:52.894
Can you help me then,
do you know of a place to hide?

30:55.375 --> 31:00.293
Um, no,

31:01.598 --> 31:05.298
no, I don't.

31:10.520 --> 31:11.521
Good morning.

31:11.521 --> 31:12.871
Good morning.

31:12.871 --> 31:13.915
How's your tooth?

31:13.915 --> 31:15.438
Oh, much better.
Thank you.

31:15.438 --> 31:17.310
And your new ration books
will be here in a few days.

31:17.310 --> 31:20.226
A few days?

31:20.226 --> 31:23.316
Uh, we'll, we'll
make do with what we've got

31:23.316 --> 31:25.361
until the new
ration books arrive.

31:25.361 --> 31:27.450
Oh, what have we got?
More potatoes?

31:27.450 --> 31:28.887
Yeah, more potatoes.

31:28.887 --> 31:30.279
And beans.

31:30.279 --> 31:32.673
I have a cake in my room.

31:34.327 --> 31:36.111
You've been here for a
whole day without mentioning

31:36.111 --> 31:38.070
you have cake?

31:38.070 --> 31:40.115
It's a small cake.

31:40.115 --> 31:42.857
Can I see this
small cake of yours?

31:44.250 --> 31:46.295
Of course.

31:46.295 --> 31:49.429
Margot, do you want to
come and look at Peter's cake?

31:49.429 --> 31:52.649
Can we have some?
Girls, it's Peter's cake.

31:52.649 --> 31:53.781
Yeah?

31:53.781 --> 31:55.565
Yes.
It's your cake, Peter.

31:55.565 --> 31:57.350
You don't have to share
it if you don't want to.

31:57.350 --> 32:00.396
It's your choice.

32:00.396 --> 32:03.182
It's in my room.

32:09.318 --> 32:11.842
I fear
for Peter'’s cake.

32:15.977 --> 32:18.588
I'm going to wash
before the office opens.

32:21.635 --> 32:26.118
Miep and Otto like some
time alone to discuss business.

32:26.118 --> 32:30.122
Alone.

32:33.299 --> 32:36.824
Fine,
breakfast is over.

32:36.824 --> 32:38.957
Good bye.

32:41.916 --> 32:47.182
Let's make sure
to pay these invoices.

32:51.882 --> 32:53.362
Are you okay?

32:53.362 --> 32:58.454
Dr. Pfeffer asked if
I knew of a place to hide.

32:58.454 --> 33:00.369
And you told him?

33:00.369 --> 33:01.980
Well, I said
of course I didn't.

33:01.980 --> 33:04.504
Good.

33:04.504 --> 33:06.158
But I do.

33:06.158 --> 33:08.377
And, and he's a, he's
a really nice man.

33:08.377 --> 33:09.726
I know he's
a nice man, Miep.

33:09.726 --> 33:11.380
I know you do.
You introduced me to him.

33:11.380 --> 33:13.208
He's, he's your friend,
which is why I thought.

33:13.208 --> 33:14.296
We can't take him in.

33:14.296 --> 33:16.429
We have to be
careful how we proceed.

33:16.429 --> 33:17.996
As you know it's
not easy getting food.

33:17.996 --> 33:19.475
Well, I'm getting food
for seven, what's one more?

33:19.475 --> 33:21.347
You just told me
yesterday that shopping was a

33:21.347 --> 33:23.044
burden to you that you
have no time for yourself.

33:23.044 --> 33:24.437
I know, I know.

33:24.437 --> 33:26.395
but he seems really
frightened and it was really

33:26.395 --> 33:28.484
difficult saying "no."

33:28.484 --> 33:29.572
You don't know what it's like.

33:29.572 --> 33:31.052
There are soldiers
everywhere now!

33:31.052 --> 33:33.489
You don't understand it's
getting really bad out there.

33:33.489 --> 33:36.362
I know exactly
what it's like!

33:36.362 --> 33:37.841
I fled Germany, for God's sake,

33:37.841 --> 33:39.452
because I knew how bad
it was getting there.

33:39.452 --> 33:41.323
I'm here, safe with my family,

33:41.323 --> 33:42.890
because I knew how bad
it was getting there.

33:42.890 --> 33:44.283
I sit up here all
day doing nothing,

33:44.283 --> 33:46.850
while my employees run
my business because I know

33:46.850 --> 33:49.897
how bad it's getting there.

33:51.464 --> 33:55.468
My job now, my only job,

33:55.468 --> 33:58.036
is to protect my
family and what you are,

33:59.428 --> 34:02.431
what you are...

34:13.399 --> 34:16.750
Scheisse!

34:19.796 --> 34:22.538
That clock will be
the death of me.

34:22.538 --> 34:26.499
Reminding me in 15-minute
increments that the world

34:26.499 --> 34:30.764
outside is moving forward,
while in here, in here.

34:32.374 --> 34:34.724
Hmm.

34:36.161 --> 34:39.425
Please make sure those
invoices are paid.

34:45.170 --> 34:46.649
Uh, I work for
the Jewish Council.

34:46.649 --> 34:48.129
I can get you
preferential treatment.

34:48.129 --> 34:49.130
What does that mean?

34:49.130 --> 34:50.610
Well, A bike, maybe.

34:50.610 --> 34:53.482
Uh, I don't know, a, a, a
permit to be in the park.

34:53.482 --> 34:54.570
Hello, Max.

34:54.570 --> 34:56.181
Miep, tell
my sister to stay.

34:56.181 --> 34:58.574
Oh, Miep, sorry, the
kids are jumping on your bed.

34:58.574 --> 35:00.315
We had to get them away
from Frannie's mother.

35:00.315 --> 35:03.144
Alfred broke
Mom's precious gnome statue.

35:03.144 --> 35:04.450
Kabouter Spillebeen?

35:04.450 --> 35:06.452
Mom thinks
it's a bad omen.

35:07.496 --> 35:08.976
Stop it it's not funny.

35:08.976 --> 35:11.631
Oh, I know, I'm sorry.

35:11.631 --> 35:12.980
Stop it, Max.

35:12.980 --> 35:14.024
Is Jan home?

35:14.024 --> 35:15.330
Stop it.

35:15.330 --> 35:20.161
Oh, oh.
There you are.

35:21.641 --> 35:23.077
What are you
gonna do about that?

35:23.077 --> 35:25.514
The only place for privacy.

35:25.514 --> 35:27.429
Get in. Come on.

35:27.864 --> 35:29.605
Right.

35:35.655 --> 35:41.051
Oh, Dr. Pfeffer asked me to
hide him and I asked Mr. Frank

35:41.530 --> 35:43.532
and Mr. Frank said "no"
and then shouted at me for

35:43.532 --> 35:44.751
being an idiot.

35:44.751 --> 35:47.406
It was quite a day.

35:48.798 --> 35:51.671
Bram asked for my
employment file and wants to

35:51.671 --> 35:53.325
see me in the morning.

35:53.325 --> 35:56.284
What, why?

35:56.284 --> 35:57.851
I think he knows I
lied about the clients who

35:57.851 --> 35:59.592
needed ration books.

35:59.592 --> 36:01.898
What's gonna happen?

36:01.898 --> 36:05.250
Maybe he'll fire me.

36:06.425 --> 36:09.254
Getting fired could be
a blessing in disguise.

36:09.254 --> 36:12.431
Maybe it's the push I
need to do something more.

36:13.258 --> 36:15.608
I could work at Como.

36:15.608 --> 36:17.175
No.

36:17.175 --> 36:19.873
You working for the resistance
would endanger the Franks.

36:19.873 --> 36:23.442
I need to do
something more.

36:24.094 --> 36:26.793
You make all these unilateral
decisions that affect my work

36:26.793 --> 36:28.098
and my happiness.

36:28.098 --> 36:30.100
Your happiness
doesn't matter.

36:30.100 --> 36:33.191
Neither does mine.

36:33.191 --> 36:37.238
If we spend this
war being miserable and

36:37.238 --> 36:41.634
not allowing ourselves
just a little bit of happiness,

36:41.634 --> 36:43.766
we're not gonna make it.

36:43.766 --> 36:47.683
"We," you and me
or "we," humanity?

36:48.293 --> 36:50.643
Both.

36:53.428 --> 36:54.603
Oh, my God.

36:54.603 --> 36:57.040
Oh, relax.
Nazi never...

36:57.040 --> 36:59.260
Oh, doesn't
ring the doorbell.

36:59.260 --> 37:01.219
Precisely.

37:04.439 --> 37:05.614
Who is it?

37:05.614 --> 37:07.660
Who the hell
do you think it is?

37:07.660 --> 37:09.705
Oh, hello.

37:10.184 --> 37:11.751
Looks like I've got
here just in time.

37:11.751 --> 37:12.969
Come on, you two.
You're coming out.

37:12.969 --> 37:15.537
I'm not having
"no" for an answer.

37:15.537 --> 37:17.670
Out, now.

37:20.716 --> 37:22.022
Slivovitz!

37:22.022 --> 37:24.285
What is that?
It is plum brandy.

37:24.285 --> 37:25.765
Ooh, I have work tomorrow.

37:25.765 --> 37:27.375
So maybe I should
just have a beer.

37:27.375 --> 37:28.811
Oh, no, come on,
my boyfriend just bought
us some shots.

37:28.811 --> 37:30.117
Let's not be rude.

37:30.117 --> 37:31.640
Okay. Cheers.

37:31.640 --> 37:33.163
Let's do it.
To new friends.

37:33.163 --> 37:35.122
To new friends.

37:35.122 --> 37:36.515
Oh!

37:36.515 --> 37:38.430
And that's in a
roundabout way is how I got

37:38.430 --> 37:40.736
into social work.

37:41.868 --> 37:43.739
How about you?

37:43.739 --> 37:46.351
Oh. Um, cars.

37:46.655 --> 37:49.571
Ah.

37:50.398 --> 37:52.661
Cars,

37:52.661 --> 37:57.318
just, I know what cars are,
but what do you do with them?

37:58.188 --> 37:59.625
Do, um, like, tell me more.

37:59.625 --> 38:00.843
Parts.
Parts?

38:00.843 --> 38:02.976
Parts.
Oh, yeah.

38:02.976 --> 38:04.717
More drinks?

38:04.717 --> 38:07.502
Yes.
Man of few words.

38:09.809 --> 38:11.201
Tess, if
this isn't our car,

38:11.201 --> 38:13.508
then why is your
handbag in the front?

38:15.641 --> 38:17.860
Oh, God, I'm going to
be so hungover tomorrow.

38:17.860 --> 38:19.819
Oh, my God.
Me too.

38:19.819 --> 38:22.517
Oh, oh, wait, but your,
um, your boss has left town.

38:22.517 --> 38:24.737
Uh, yeah, yeah.

38:24.737 --> 38:27.696
Tess said he
was one of the good ones.

38:27.696 --> 38:30.743
What's that
supposed to mean?

38:31.657 --> 38:32.919
Uh, nothing.

38:32.919 --> 38:36.401
Um, just that he
was a good person.

38:36.401 --> 38:38.751
Oh, a lot of
Jews are good people.

38:38.751 --> 38:40.361
That's what
Daniel's saying.

38:40.361 --> 38:42.624
Yeah, yeah.

38:42.624 --> 38:44.887
I mean, my boss left because
his 16-year-old daughter was

38:44.887 --> 38:46.541
being sent to a work camp.

38:46.541 --> 38:49.501
Maybe it's more relevant to
talk about the not-so-good men

38:49.501 --> 38:51.372
who are sending children
away from their families.

38:51.372 --> 38:53.896
So, well,
I, I'm, right, yeah.

38:53.896 --> 38:55.724
This is, this is why
I stay out of politics.

38:55.724 --> 38:59.380
Yeah, well, I can't do
that when people are suffering.

38:59.380 --> 39:00.773
Let's jump in the canal.

39:00.773 --> 39:01.948
What?
Come on!
No!

39:01.948 --> 39:03.993
Yes, it'll be fun!
No. Tess!

39:03.993 --> 39:05.560
Remember when we were
kids and you chickened out?

39:05.560 --> 39:07.606
No, no, no, no, don't!
Uh, Tess, Tess!

39:07.606 --> 39:09.172
Tess!

39:09.172 --> 39:10.870
Uh, yeah, one, one
thing, one thing quick, um...

39:10.870 --> 39:12.045
What?

39:12.045 --> 39:13.046
Uh, you're
going in the canal.

39:13.046 --> 39:14.656
No, no, no!

39:14.656 --> 39:15.831
Because we have to
have someone to test the depth.

39:15.831 --> 39:16.919
No, please...

39:16.919 --> 39:18.791
I'm really,
really sorry.

39:18.791 --> 39:20.445
We're doing this?

39:20.445 --> 39:23.622
Let's all sit down
and then go together.

39:25.754 --> 39:27.713
Okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay.

39:28.975 --> 39:32.021
Guys ready?

39:32.021 --> 39:34.720
Three, two, one.

39:43.293 --> 39:44.773
Are you okay?

39:52.999 --> 39:55.480
Did you like
that dress I made?

39:55.480 --> 39:57.133
Yeah.

39:57.133 --> 39:58.744
No, you didn't.

39:58.744 --> 40:00.136
I, I did, I did.

40:00.136 --> 40:02.661
You are such a bad liar.

40:02.661 --> 40:05.359
Stop, I'm learning.

40:05.359 --> 40:07.927
I'll get better.

40:07.927 --> 40:09.798
Look at you, you
used to be useless.

40:09.798 --> 40:11.626
Now, you're running an empire.

40:11.626 --> 40:14.107
Uh, I'm not.

40:14.412 --> 40:16.152
Seriously though.

40:16.152 --> 40:18.328
Well, I think you work too much,
but I never see you,

40:18.328 --> 40:22.463
you'’re no fun but
it is impressive.

40:22.463 --> 40:25.292
I mean, you are impressive.

40:25.292 --> 40:27.250
Thank you.

40:28.164 --> 40:31.429
I'm serious,
you could do anything.

40:34.083 --> 40:35.868
You could help me
sell my dresses.

40:35.868 --> 40:37.826
No, think about it.
Think about it.

40:37.826 --> 40:41.003
Daniel's money, my designs,
your business sense.

40:41.003 --> 40:43.179
I, I can't leave Opekta.

40:43.179 --> 40:45.791
But Mr. Frank is gone.
He'd understand if you left.

40:45.791 --> 40:49.969
No, no, I need to stay.
I'm going to stay.

40:50.796 --> 40:53.581
Mrs. Loyal.

40:54.930 --> 40:56.541
Not a bad thing.

40:56.541 --> 41:00.196
No.
Well, I just missed you.

41:00.545 --> 41:02.938
I missed you too.

41:02.938 --> 41:04.549
You wanna
go get breakfast?

41:04.549 --> 41:06.855
Yes, absolutely.
Yeah?
I'm starving.

41:07.203 --> 41:08.814
Go, go, go!

41:08.814 --> 41:12.470
All Jews line up at the trucks.

41:12.470 --> 41:14.123
Back in line!

41:18.650 --> 41:20.521
Move!

41:21.870 --> 41:24.351
Have your boarding pass
ready for inspection.

41:24.351 --> 41:26.396
Remain calm.

41:28.050 --> 41:30.488
We should go.
This could get dangerous.

41:32.577 --> 41:36.537
This is so sad.
Is there nothing we can do?

41:36.537 --> 41:39.975
No.
We should go, come on.

41:40.498 --> 41:42.412
Miep.

41:45.720 --> 41:48.027
Keep going, keep going!

41:48.027 --> 41:49.811
Go.

41:50.508 --> 41:53.032
I can't believe
this is happening.

41:53.511 --> 41:54.773
What are
you two staring at?

41:54.773 --> 41:56.818
Move along!

41:56.818 --> 41:59.952
Now, come on.
There's nothing we can do here.

41:59.952 --> 42:03.259
It's not worth it.
Come on, come on.

42:21.060 --> 42:23.192
Good morning, Miep.

42:23.497 --> 42:25.847
Mr. Frank,
are you all right?

42:26.282 --> 42:28.023
I couldn't sleep.

42:28.023 --> 42:29.285
Neither did I.

42:29.285 --> 42:31.070
There was a roundup
at the River District.

42:31.070 --> 42:33.246
And you're right, you do
know what it's like out there.

42:33.246 --> 42:34.421
Miep.

42:34.421 --> 42:36.075
And I don't.
I don't understand.

42:36.075 --> 42:37.293
I never will.

42:37.293 --> 42:39.861
But I know that we
can help Dr. Pfeffer.

42:39.861 --> 42:41.428
And if we can, we should.

42:41.428 --> 42:42.603
We, we have to.

42:42.603 --> 42:44.779
I agree.

42:44.779 --> 42:47.390
I already talked
to Edith about it.

42:47.390 --> 42:50.002
I spoke with the
Van Pels as well.

42:50.002 --> 42:51.525
You did?

42:51.525 --> 42:54.963
I started to worry
that Anne was right.

42:54.963 --> 42:57.879
That if we turn away
someone we know we can help,

42:57.879 --> 43:01.143
then we become people
we don't recognize,

43:01.143 --> 43:04.059
and we don't exist anymore.

43:04.059 --> 43:05.060
Come.

43:05.060 --> 43:07.585
I'll get you some coffee.

43:12.024 --> 43:16.506
Dr. Pfeffer, Dr. Pfeffer.

43:19.074 --> 43:22.948
Miep.
What are you doing here?

43:24.123 --> 43:25.820
Is it your tooth again?

43:25.820 --> 43:27.561
My tooth is fine.

43:27.561 --> 43:31.696
I found a place, a hiding place.

43:34.568 --> 43:37.353
But we have to go, now.

43:37.963 --> 43:39.747
I, I have to tell Lottie.

43:39.747 --> 43:41.967
She can't know, she can't.

43:41.967 --> 43:44.143
We, we can't take any risk
that she might follow you.

43:44.143 --> 43:45.927
The, the location of
the hiding place has to be

43:45.927 --> 43:47.668
kept completely secret.

43:47.668 --> 43:48.930
She won't follow.

43:48.930 --> 43:52.194
I'll let her know
once you're in hiding.

43:57.635 --> 44:01.377
I mean, this is,
this is all so, so sudden.

44:01.377 --> 44:02.640
I know.

44:02.640 --> 44:05.164
I can't.
I just arrived at work.

44:05.164 --> 44:06.556
I haven't had my coffee.

44:06.556 --> 44:08.689
What am I to tell my patients?

44:08.689 --> 44:13.041
I mean, I'm afraid today is,
is simply out of the question.

44:13.041 --> 44:15.087
It'll, it'll have
to be tomorrow.

44:15.087 --> 44:18.481
Dr. Pfeffer, there
was a roundup last night.

44:18.481 --> 44:20.483
I saw it.

44:20.483 --> 44:24.487
German soldiers blocked off
an entire neighborhood

44:24.487 --> 44:29.231
and arrested all the
Jews, children, old people.

44:32.234 --> 44:35.716
Dr. Pfeffer, I, I saw
it with my own eyes.

44:36.195 --> 44:38.414
They're not rumors.

44:47.728 --> 44:49.861
Okay.

44:49.861 --> 44:54.082
Okay, okay,
you'll go to Dam Square.

44:54.082 --> 44:55.431
There, by the fountain,

44:55.431 --> 44:57.520
you'll find a man
waiting for you and he'll,

44:57.520 --> 44:59.958
he'll take you to
the hiding place.

44:59.958 --> 45:02.221
How will I recognize him?

45:02.221 --> 45:03.831
You won't.

45:03.831 --> 45:05.746
You'll stand at the west of
the fountain and you'll hum

45:05.746 --> 45:07.705
the song "Blonde Mientje."

45:07.705 --> 45:10.229
"Blonde Mientje", yeah.

45:15.451 --> 45:17.453
Okay.

45:23.808 --> 45:25.505
I imagine you're
wondering why you're here.

45:25.505 --> 45:27.028
Not really, no.

45:27.028 --> 45:29.074
Huh.

45:29.465 --> 45:31.816
Gerdi brought you to my
attention a few weeks ago.

45:31.816 --> 45:34.514
She noticed you were
asking for extra rations.

45:34.514 --> 45:36.081
Twice.

45:36.081 --> 45:38.518
Three times.

45:38.518 --> 45:40.259
And you
didn't report them.

45:40.259 --> 45:42.827
Made me wonder who you're
actually asking them for.

45:42.827 --> 45:45.046
Did it?

45:47.875 --> 45:49.921
You've been
with us 11 years.

45:49.921 --> 45:51.574
No infractions.

45:51.574 --> 45:54.142
Then you looked the other way
when a client didn't wanna work

45:54.142 --> 45:57.363
with a German officer.

45:57.363 --> 46:01.497
I began to suspect
you might have political
leanings with your spotless,

46:01.497 --> 46:05.284
if unimpressive,
work history didn't reflect.

46:05.284 --> 46:08.330
Sir, these are
difficult times for everyone,

46:08.330 --> 46:10.811
and there are calls
that need to be made.

46:10.811 --> 46:12.247
I simply made a call.

46:12.247 --> 46:16.208
I'm making
a call with you.

46:19.515 --> 46:23.084
There are a number of us
here who disagree with the

46:23.084 --> 46:25.478
policies of the occupiers.

46:25.478 --> 46:27.785
And we're doing everything
we can to help those who

46:27.785 --> 46:30.918
are being persecuted.

46:30.918 --> 46:33.921
We'd like you to join us.

46:35.793 --> 46:37.751
Is this a joke?

46:37.751 --> 46:39.535
Do we look
like we're joking?

46:39.535 --> 46:41.320
Does she look
like she's joking?

46:41.320 --> 46:42.974
I'm not joking.

46:42.974 --> 46:44.279
Really, sir?

46:44.279 --> 46:45.454
Yes.

46:45.454 --> 46:49.763
Yes, yes, yes,
I'd love to help.

46:50.024 --> 46:51.634
What is it you do?

46:51.634 --> 46:54.550
I'm only gonna share with
you what's absolutely necessary.

46:54.550 --> 46:59.294
And I ask that you don't share
anything we do with anyone.

46:59.294 --> 47:01.993
Of course.
Mum's the word.

47:01.993 --> 47:04.604
I know you're
newly married and I
know what that's like.

47:04.604 --> 47:07.694
Heady days, but when I say
don't share with anyone,

47:07.694 --> 47:09.217
I mean not even your wife.

47:09.217 --> 47:11.916
I assume that's not a problem.

47:24.363 --> 47:27.366
Miep, what
are you doing here?

47:27.366 --> 47:28.454
I'll explain later.

47:28.454 --> 47:31.196
Just follow me
quickly and quietly.

47:41.641 --> 47:44.383
After you.

48:00.834 --> 48:03.619
Mr. Frank.

48:04.490 --> 48:08.450
But I, I, I, I thought
you were in Switzerland.

48:10.017 --> 48:12.411
Welcome to Switzerland.

48:14.848 --> 48:16.502
Hello, hello.
Have a seat, have a seat.

48:16.502 --> 48:18.243
Hello, sir.
Mrs. Pels, how are you?

48:18.243 --> 48:20.201
Let me
get you some cake.

48:20.201 --> 48:23.683
I, I didn't
know where I was going.

48:23.683 --> 48:26.381
Miep wouldn't tell me.

48:26.381 --> 48:27.905
She didn't
tell me, either.

48:27.905 --> 48:30.211
She's getting
to be a very good spy.

48:30.211 --> 48:31.734
I've written up
some house rules for you.

48:31.734 --> 48:32.953
If you wanna read them.

48:32.953 --> 48:34.215
Okay.

48:34.215 --> 48:35.695
Okay.
Actually, no, I'll read them.

48:35.695 --> 48:38.002
So, we wake up at 6:45,
and then we have breakfast,

48:38.002 --> 48:39.525
and then we wash up.

48:39.525 --> 48:41.570
Oh, we have to pee
in a bucket during the day.

48:41.570 --> 48:43.529
Oh, okay.

48:43.529 --> 48:45.618
Children, I think
we should give our new
friend a minute to relax.

48:45.618 --> 48:48.490
Yeah, before we
give him the gory details.

48:48.490 --> 48:50.057
Right. I'm going to go.

48:50.057 --> 48:53.060
Dr. Pfeffer, I'm really,
really glad that you're here.

48:53.060 --> 48:56.368
Yeah, uh, will you,
uh, and, uh, you'll.

48:56.368 --> 48:57.978
I'll tell Lottie tonight.

48:57.978 --> 49:00.459
Thank you. Thank you.

49:00.459 --> 49:03.941
Miep.
I'm not mad anymore.

49:07.074 --> 49:08.946
Good.

49:20.696 --> 49:24.570
Hey, how did it
go with Dr. Pfeffer?

49:26.964 --> 49:28.966
Where is everyone?

49:28.966 --> 49:31.925
Frannie and Lou
decided to take their chances

49:31.925 --> 49:35.015
to see if they could
catch a train back to Leiden.

49:35.015 --> 49:38.801
Mrs. Stoppelman was upset
and she went to speak to Max.

49:40.499 --> 49:42.718
I went to tell Lottie.

49:42.718 --> 49:44.590
Oh, yeah?
How did that go?

49:44.590 --> 49:46.157
Terrible.

49:46.157 --> 49:47.549
She was on her
way to play bridge.

49:47.549 --> 49:48.986
And she just kept saying,

49:48.986 --> 49:52.163
"What do I do?
Do I go and play bridge?"

49:52.163 --> 49:53.338
What did you say?

49:53.338 --> 49:55.949
I said,
"Go and play bridge."

49:55.949 --> 49:57.559
You didn't get fired?

49:57.559 --> 49:59.387
No.

49:59.387 --> 50:01.563
What did he want?

50:01.563 --> 50:07.439
Just standard
dressing-down about
sloppy clerical errors.

50:08.962 --> 50:11.182
He's such an ass.

50:11.182 --> 50:14.272
Yeah, he's, he's,
he's something else.

50:18.798 --> 50:21.409
We're alone.

50:22.671 --> 50:24.673
The first time in a while.

50:24.673 --> 50:26.675
Yeah.

50:28.764 --> 50:31.550
Are you thinking?

50:31.550 --> 50:33.595
Let's take these off.

50:33.595 --> 50:36.163
Oh, there you are.

50:49.089 --> 50:51.657
Take this off.

51:00.622 --> 51:01.841
Let's go in the bedroom,

51:01.841 --> 51:04.017
in case Mrs. Stoppelman
comes home.

51:04.017 --> 51:07.064
That sounds quite fun.
Mrs. Stoppelman.

51:11.807 --> 51:15.550
You said Nazis
wouldn't ring the doorbell.

51:15.550 --> 51:17.813
They don't knock either.

51:20.077 --> 51:22.644
Let me get rid of whoever it is.

51:31.784 --> 51:33.960
Do you
know these children?

51:34.787 --> 51:36.745
Yes.

51:36.745 --> 51:38.747
We're their
grandmother's tenants.

51:38.747 --> 51:40.445
She's not home.

51:40.445 --> 51:42.795
Their parents were
arrested at the train station.

51:42.795 --> 51:44.927
I took pity on them.

51:44.927 --> 51:47.930
I could get in a lot
of trouble for this.

51:47.930 --> 51:50.585
Alfred, Liddy, come here.

51:54.372 --> 51:57.592
They'd better not
be here when I come back.

51:57.592 --> 52:00.160
Of course.
